02:10.500 --> 02:13.020
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?!

02:14.020 --> 02:15.220
- You're a punk, Sam!
- Get off.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.380
I ought to kill you!
You fucking dickhead!

02:17.580 --> 02:19.420
- I told you to never touch my camera!
- Stop!

02:19.620 --> 02:22.740
Didn't I?! Fucker! You little wimp!
Bitch! Pussy! I told you!

02:23.220 --> 02:25.900
I ought to fucking kill you!
And I will kill you, you little punk,

02:26.100 --> 02:28.540
if I ever catch you fucking
with my camera again.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.900
- He's so gonna cry.
- Step on him!

02:31.100 --> 02:32.780
- Get out of my way!
- Relax, man.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.620
Are you OK?

02:43.740 --> 02:47.220
You ever stare at the ceiling
till it started looking kind of funny?

02:49.260 --> 02:51.420
Like it was breathing.
Like it was saying something.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.900
Like it was saying,
"Rocky,

02:54.100 --> 02:57.300
you gotta do something
about what's been going on."

03:03.620 --> 03:05.820
Something's gotta happen, Sam.

03:06.180 --> 03:07.900
Something's gotta give.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.460
We can call the police.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.500
Police wouldn't do jack.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.060
I wish I was bigger.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.100
I'm bigger.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.140
Not to mention the fact
that I'm smarter.

03:22.340 --> 03:24.660
If you do something,
he'll just get you.

03:24.860 --> 03:28.220
Did you ever used to get me
when we used to play hide-and-seek?

03:28.420 --> 03:31.420
- No.
- He wouldn't have any better luck.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.860
Wanna know my secret hiding spot?

03:39.100 --> 03:40.820
The roof.

03:41.860 --> 03:44.100
The disappearing man.

03:44.580 --> 03:46.140
Exactly.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.740
So high. Oh, my God.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.980
Rocky's thinking about
doing something to George.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.100
I don't get how the teachers

04:05.300 --> 04:07.140
can just let him get away with that.

04:08.940 --> 04:11.220
Teachers don't care.

04:11.420 --> 04:14.940
They have him in detention
for 15 minutes for a week.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.220
Something's gotta give.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.100
If you could snap your fingers
right now,

04:21.300 --> 04:24.740
and he would drop dead in his tracks,
would you do it?

04:34.620 --> 04:36.140
Are we still on for Saturday?

04:38.060 --> 04:39.740
Yeah, of course.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.820
So, what are we gonna do?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.420
I'll figure something out,

04:43.620 --> 04:45.060
and I'll surprise you.

04:54.780 --> 04:57.700
Hey, you know that fat kid, George,

04:57.900 --> 05:00.060
who they keep holding back
from graduating middle school?

05:00.260 --> 05:01.620
Yeah, I hate that guy.

05:01.820 --> 05:03.340
He beat up Sam.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.180
No.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.420
Hey, you know
when we were at Rollins,

05:07.620 --> 05:09.180
that crazy kid
chased me across the field

05:09.380 --> 05:10.780
and cracked my head
open with a bat.

05:10.980 --> 05:13.540
- Finally, an explanation.
- Yeah, anyway...

05:13.740 --> 05:15.820
- He's a real pig.
- I say we smoke that ham.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.220
Yeah? Make some
ham sandwiches?

05:17.420 --> 05:19.820
Pork chop-ify him.
Spam-icize him.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.620
- Link sausage-ize him!
- Squeal, piggy! Squeal!

05:23.820 --> 05:25.900
No, screw that guy.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.860
You'd really like to do that,
wouldn't you, Clyde?

05:28.060 --> 05:30.140
- You're projecting, Marty.
- Projecting?

05:30.340 --> 05:32.660
That's when you say something
that someone else...

05:32.860 --> 05:36.580
You say that they want to do, when
you're the one who wants to do it.

05:36.740 --> 05:38.180
No, no, no. That's good.
That's good.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.660
Hold up, Rocky. Back up.
I got something for you.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.300
Just a little...

05:42.500 --> 05:44.940
- Oh, you son of a bitch!
- I was just projecting.

05:45.140 --> 05:48.340
Oh, you asshole!

05:50.620 --> 05:52.140
Later.

05:55.780 --> 05:57.860
Wait up, man!

05:58.180 --> 06:00.340
Let's go get some ice cream.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.940
OK, Dave.

06:02.180 --> 06:03.060
Hey!

06:03.060 --> 06:03.580
Hey!

06:05.220 --> 06:07.500
- Where were you guys?
- Get beat up today?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.620
See any new scars?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.460
- Got any more gum?
- I'm chewing the whole pack.

06:14.180 --> 06:16.100
Why, you want some?

06:22.060 --> 06:23.860
Tasty.

06:27.660 --> 06:28.820
OK,

06:29.020 --> 06:32.940
Jennifer Lopez or the girl
who sits behind you in school?

06:33.140 --> 06:34.740
J. Lo.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.420
OK, I think I got one.

06:41.740 --> 06:44.100
Tie him to a tree,
pour some honey on his face,

06:44.300 --> 06:45.820
and leave him there
all day and night.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.100
- Why?
- It's for the bugs,

06:47.300 --> 06:48.700
so they'd get on him
and bite him.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.100
- No, we can't do that.
- Why not?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.340
Well, what if a bear came?

06:54.980 --> 06:56.380
Shut up.

07:00.740 --> 07:02.100
You know,

07:02.380 --> 07:05.500
if we hurt him,
we'd be just as bad as him.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.860
So we need to hurt him
without really hurting him.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.660
I mean, if you could think
of something like that, then...

07:10.860 --> 07:12.580
Then what?

07:12.980 --> 07:14.660
I don't know.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.780
All right, Heather Locklear

07:18.980 --> 07:21.980
or Shannen Doherty?

07:22.740 --> 07:24.500
Don't know who
Heather Locklear is.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.700
You don't...? Dude!

07:39.900 --> 07:41.180
So, what do you say?

07:44.380 --> 07:46.860
I think it's a totally wild plan.

07:49.780 --> 07:51.980
It's also the only plan
my brother would agree to.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.900
He's just a little fucking
Gandhi, isn't he?

07:54.100 --> 07:56.460
Like a fucking white
Martin Luther King.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.940
All we need now is a boat.

07:59.140 --> 08:02.020
Hey, my neighbor's got a boat
in her back yard that she never uses.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.500
- Does that mean you're in?
- Do you actually think he'll go for it?

08:04.700 --> 08:08.580
Oh, please. George'll get a hard-on
as soon as he picks up the phone.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.780
Rock will throw on some of
that "sweet boy" charm of his.

08:11.980 --> 08:14.780
Kid's desperate. Stupid.
It's human nature.

08:14.980 --> 08:18.260
All I know is, is I'm getting a hard-on
just thinking about it.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.980
Your mom don't need
the car Saturday, does she?

08:23.180 --> 08:25.500
The only thing my mom needs
on Saturdays is Valium.

08:26.980 --> 08:28.340
What do you think, Clyde?

08:28.540 --> 08:32.580
Do we want to give Georgie Porgie a
little taste of his own medicine? Huh?

08:32.780 --> 08:34.419
Be some good, clean fun,
don't you think?

08:34.620 --> 08:36.020
Yeah, he deserves it, doesn't he?

08:36.220 --> 08:38.059
If there's one thing
that can't be argued,

08:38.260 --> 08:41.340
it's that that fat freak deserves
whatever he's got coming to him.

08:45.260 --> 08:47.260
Dude, what'd I tell you?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.140
You don't smoke herb.

08:49.340 --> 08:51.180
Yeah, so get it out of my face.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.300
Faggot.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.460
Clyde-o,

09:05.180 --> 09:06.420
I'm just fucking with you.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.900
You're not a faggot, all right?

09:11.620 --> 09:12.980
OK?

09:14.300 --> 09:15.980
Fist bump?

09:16.580 --> 09:18.300
Fist bump?

09:19.540 --> 09:21.700
OK, zero kilter.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.380
Besides, I like your dads, Clyde.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.260
I never knew any homosexual men
personally until I met them.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.100
They're not so bad.

09:31.220 --> 09:33.700
Don't you think so, Rocky?

09:46.740 --> 09:49.060
Clyde, don't worry about Marty.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.980
It's just B.S.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.700
OK? Come on. It's B.S.

09:54.900 --> 09:58.340
OK? It's B.S.! B.S.! Come on!

09:58.820 --> 10:00.220
OK?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.100
Hello? George?

10:15.300 --> 10:19.580
Hey, hey. This is Rocky Maris,
Sam's older brother.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.580
Yeah. I got your number
off the call list.

10:22.780 --> 10:24.900
Is that OK? Great.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.060
Well, what I wanted to call
you about was...

10:27.260 --> 10:29.340
Is that I'm inviting you to...
To a party for Sam.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.420
Now, I know that you two have
been having some trouble lately.

10:32.580 --> 10:33.620
But you know what?

10:33.820 --> 10:35.620
He's always talking about
how cool you are.

10:35.820 --> 10:38.140
And it would really mean a lot
to him if you could come.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.780
It's his birthday.

10:39.980 --> 10:41.860
It's on Saturday at noon.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.700
We can pick you up if you'd like.

10:44.580 --> 10:46.620
We're going boating.
We're going on a boating trip.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.580
You like boating?

10:49.020 --> 10:50.740
Yeah, awesome.
So the only thing

10:50.940 --> 10:53.860
that I can really ask you to do,
is not tell too many people.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.660
Because we didn't really invite
a lot of people, and...

10:56.860 --> 10:59.620
And, you know, everyone knows
everybody in this town.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.060
And you tell your parents,

11:02.260 --> 11:05.060
parents will tell other parents,
and those parents will tell their kids.

11:05.260 --> 11:07.140
And pretty soon everyone
who didn't get invited

11:07.300 --> 11:10.420
will be sitting at home, crying.
We don't want that, do we?

11:10.620 --> 11:12.780
There you go.
So do you want me to pick you up

11:12.980 --> 11:15.220
at noon? Awesome!

11:15.420 --> 11:17.820
So I will see you at noon, George.

11:18.020 --> 11:20.540
Awesome. Have a great day. Bye.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.980
- Oh, God.
- What did he say?

11:23.180 --> 11:25.380
He said he would love to go.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.700
He'd love to go.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.420
Oh, I'd love to go.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.660
I'd love to... If you could just...

11:34.020 --> 11:35.860
I'd love, love, love to go.

11:36.060 --> 11:39.220
Oh, I'd love to go! Come here.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.260
- Say "uncle."
- Uncle.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.060
- Uncle who?
- Uncle Martini!

11:53.340 --> 11:56.180
Kiss my ass, Mr. Shaham.

11:57.180 --> 12:00.140
Kiss my ass, Mr. Estes.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.900
Kiss my ass, Ms. Johnson.

12:06.420 --> 12:09.780
Kiss my ass, Mr. Rosenthal.

12:15.140 --> 12:16.260
Shit.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.700
Hey! What's up with my shooter,
twerp face.

12:19.900 --> 12:20.980
Target practice.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.260
It's 11 a.m. In the morning
for chrissakes.

12:23.460 --> 12:26.020
Most people are doing cartwheels
by 11, Kile.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.060
Aren't you supposed to be
in school?

12:28.260 --> 12:29.660
Fuck school.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.380
I don't see you in school.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.420
And besides, you're not Dad.

12:36.460 --> 12:37.580
Come here.

12:38.260 --> 12:39.740
Come here!

12:55.180 --> 12:57.100
Yeah, you're right, I'm not Dad.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.900
Dad didn't yank as hard as I do.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.300
I don't really want to hear about Dad,
you understand?

13:01.860 --> 13:03.820
- You understand?
- Yes.

13:04.340 --> 13:05.940
Now, hand me my gun.

13:06.140 --> 13:07.460
Look, stupid.

13:07.660 --> 13:10.060
You ever take this
without my permission again,

13:10.260 --> 13:12.060
I guarantee it, you'll be sorry.

13:12.420 --> 13:13.700
- You understand?
- Yeah.

13:13.900 --> 13:14.860
- You get it?
- Yes.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.140
Kiss my ass, Kile.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.780
Things to say to Sam
on our date.

13:50.660 --> 13:51.980
One.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.700
So...

13:54.900 --> 13:57.060
Sam, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?

14:00.460 --> 14:01.940
Two.

14:02.860 --> 14:04.340
Are you happy

14:04.580 --> 14:06.380
or sad

14:06.700 --> 14:09.340
that we're leaving
Rollins next year?

14:12.100 --> 14:13.140
Three.

14:13.900 --> 14:17.700
So, what's your father do
for a living again?

14:17.860 --> 14:20.340
Oh, he has a car-stereo company.

14:26.020 --> 14:27.580
Do you believe in God?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.860
That's a weird question.

14:35.780 --> 14:38.020
So, what's it like being a male?

14:40.100 --> 14:42.340
OK, stupid question.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.380
My name is George.

15:28.380 --> 15:31.140
This is the inside of my mind.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.420
This is my mother.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.580
My mom works out every day.

16:00.140 --> 16:02.460
And this is my street.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.740
This is the street I live on.

16:18.180 --> 16:20.260
- What are we doing?
- You're gonna like this.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.940
Isn't that George Tooney?

16:23.140 --> 16:24.620
Yeah, he's coming
to the river with us.

16:28.140 --> 16:29.500
- Why?
- Sammy, don't you tell

16:29.700 --> 16:30.900
your girlfriend nothing?

16:31.460 --> 16:34.620
- What's he talking about, Sam?
- You should've told her, Sam.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.740
All right, everyone.
He's coming. Be nice to him.

16:36.940 --> 16:39.740
Millie, it's supposed to be part
of the surprise. We...

16:39.940 --> 16:41.380
Happy birthday, Sammy.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.620
Hi, George.
Glad you could make it.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.380
You know everybody?

16:53.060 --> 16:54.820
- Yeah, sure. Hey, everybody.
- Hey.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.700
- What's happening, George?
- Hey, Georgie.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.580
- Hi, George.
- Hey, Millie.

17:01.140 --> 17:02.540
We ready?

17:19.579 --> 17:22.220
- What are you doing?
- Making a documentary.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.900
- Of what?
- Of things.

17:25.099 --> 17:28.060
Like Sam opening his present.
Go ahead and open it.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.100
Yeah, Sam, go ahead and open it.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.620
You already opened
all your other presents at home.

17:42.300 --> 17:44.060
Stream Machine's top of the line.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.820
I have one at home,
so we can have a war sometime.

17:47.020 --> 17:49.380
- Isn't it excellent?
- Oh, yeah, thank you, George.

17:49.580 --> 17:53.140
You must've blown your whole
allowance on that thing, huh, George?

17:53.340 --> 17:56.500
How much you bagging
a week now, 40, 50 bucks?

17:58.340 --> 17:59.620
It's very sweet of you, George.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.820
I got it at Funco.

18:03.020 --> 18:05.380
- You can return it if you want.
- Oh, no, it's perfect.

18:08.540 --> 18:10.220
Well...

18:11.140 --> 18:13.540
...it's a beautiful day
for a boat trip with some buddies.

18:24.380 --> 18:25.980
Hey, Marty?

18:26.180 --> 18:27.820
My mom made me sign
one of those contracts.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.940
It's just, like... You know, I'm not
allowed to get in a car with a driver

18:31.140 --> 18:32.820
- who's been drinking.
- Oh, it's cool.

18:33.020 --> 18:34.980
My mom gave me permission
to drink and drive.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.220
- You don't have to worry about it.
- Your mom must be pretty stupid

18:38.420 --> 18:40.380
to give you permission
to drive inebriated.

18:40.580 --> 18:43.220
No, you're right, George.
My mom is pretty stupid.

18:43.700 --> 18:47.300
In fact, she's got one of those
learning-disability things.

18:48.980 --> 18:50.620
Must be a bad LD.

18:50.820 --> 18:53.020
I have an LD,

18:53.220 --> 18:55.940
but I should know you're
not supposed to drive drunk.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.300
I see stuff all backwards and shit.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.300
Like, instead of seeing "stop"
on a stop sign,

19:02.500 --> 19:03.660
I see "pots."

19:04.780 --> 19:06.540
My doctor says it's

19:06.740 --> 19:09.740
a genetic variation,
like for evolution.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.780
So maybe I'm a superior being.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.380
The future of the race.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.380
Like, if aliens came down
and they had a...

19:21.580 --> 19:25.140
A language,
a super-advanced language,

19:25.340 --> 19:27.180
that said you had to read
this way to that way,

19:27.380 --> 19:29.300
instead of that way
to this way.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.740
Shit.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.500
Yo, kidlings.

20:10.820 --> 20:12.540
What are you guys doing here?

20:12.740 --> 20:14.140
Eating mini beef tacos.

20:14.660 --> 20:17.620
Finest mini beef tacos
in the world here.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.780
Yummy.

20:20.660 --> 20:22.700
What, did you steal
Mom's car again?

20:22.900 --> 20:24.740
- Why do you care?
- I don't give a fuck.

20:25.260 --> 20:26.780
Who's the minors?

20:26.980 --> 20:28.700
It's just my brother
and some of his friends.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.820
What are the paddles for?

20:30.980 --> 20:33.260
We're going cow spanking.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.100
Cow spanking, what's that?

20:36.300 --> 20:37.820
It's like cow tipping,

20:38.020 --> 20:39.140
only we spank.

20:40.180 --> 20:41.220
Really.

20:41.420 --> 20:44.260
Come on, let's just get the smokes
and get out of here.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.860
Camels.

20:50.180 --> 20:52.380
While you boys are out
cow spanking,

20:52.580 --> 20:54.100
Kile and I are gonna go
pussy hunting.

20:54.300 --> 20:57.100
- Good for you, Jasper.
- Hey, don't get sassy with my boy.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.420
You ever been pussy hunting?

21:03.420 --> 21:05.540
No, I didn't think so.

21:05.740 --> 21:07.780
You know how I knew?

21:07.980 --> 21:10.620
Because you gotta have some bait
to catch one.

21:11.340 --> 21:12.500
That's great.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.060
Grow up, Jasper.
Let's go, Marty.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.220
Jesus, Jasper.
Why do you have to...?

21:46.420 --> 21:47.580
Dumb fucks.

21:47.780 --> 21:50.180
Why do you have
to act so retarded?

21:50.380 --> 21:52.180
Have fun cow spanking, boys.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.460
- Oh, man. That was awesome.
- You see that shit?

22:16.780 --> 22:19.780
- So whose road is this?
- It's just a road.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.100
Hey, you guys ever hear about

22:26.300 --> 22:28.740
when Rocky and I
were kicking it out here?

22:28.940 --> 22:31.460
We got some poison oak
on our hands.

22:31.660 --> 22:33.340
This is a disgusting story.

22:33.540 --> 22:35.180
Anyway, so we were out here,

22:35.380 --> 22:38.140
and we got some poison oak
on our hands.

22:38.340 --> 22:40.020
With all the beers we were drinking,

22:40.220 --> 22:42.260
well, naturally,
we had to take a piss.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.300
Now, I don't know
if you're hip, Millie,

22:45.500 --> 22:47.420
but when a guy pisses,

22:47.620 --> 22:50.100
he has to hold his pisser
in his hands.

22:50.300 --> 22:51.700
- Like so:
- Thanks, Marty.

22:51.940 --> 22:53.380
No, wait, I'm not finished yet.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.780
Next morning when we woke up,

22:54.980 --> 22:56.740
we both had totally chapped,
rash-y nuts.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.860
Hey, lucky you didn't run out
of toilet paper,

22:59.060 --> 23:01.660
have to wipe your butt
with your hand.

23:09.060 --> 23:11.260
Ouch, ouch!
I just got stung by something.

23:11.460 --> 23:13.860
- You all right?
- Yeah.

23:15.380 --> 23:17.220
You guys just go ahead.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.060
Better make sure it's not a tick.

23:19.260 --> 23:20.820
Lyme's disease, you know.

23:21.020 --> 23:23.900
Look, all right, there'll be three circles
around the bite if it's Lyme's disease.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.660
But, like, you gotta watch out
because you could

23:25.860 --> 23:27.580
just straight drop dead
from Lyme's disease.

23:27.780 --> 23:29.220
Thanks, George.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.500
Oh, if it is a tick and it gets dug in,

23:31.700 --> 23:33.220
we might need to take my tweezers

23:33.420 --> 23:35.820
and, like, put it under a flame
until it gets, like, red hot,

23:36.020 --> 23:39.620
and then burn the thing to death
so it'll let go before we pull it out.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.620
Can you leave us alone
for a second?

23:46.780 --> 23:48.180
Thanks.

23:50.380 --> 23:53.260
Seems like George is having
a good time.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.140
What are you trying
to say, Clyde?

23:55.740 --> 23:58.460
Fat boy's gonna get
what he's got coming.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.380
I don't see a stinger.

24:05.700 --> 24:08.540
Sam, what's going on here
with George?

24:08.740 --> 24:11.340
Oh, it's nothing bad.
It's just a joke.

24:11.540 --> 24:13.020
What kind of joke?

24:13.220 --> 24:14.660
Well...

24:15.580 --> 24:17.780
...we're planning on stripping him,
throwing him in the river,

24:18.020 --> 24:20.180
and then we're gonna make him
run home naked.

24:20.380 --> 24:23.220
- We have a plan. It involves a dare.
- A dare?

24:23.460 --> 24:24.980
Yeah. See, the only reason
I didn't tell you before...

24:25.180 --> 24:27.260
Who said I wanted to be
part of this?

24:28.420 --> 24:30.300
All right, what about this?

24:31.780 --> 24:32.740
What's that?

24:32.940 --> 24:34.260
"If you could snap your fingers
right now,

24:34.460 --> 24:36.820
"and he would drop dead
in his tracks, would you do it?"

24:37.500 --> 24:40.140
- It's totally mean, Sam.
- He's mean.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.260
He's a stupid fat kid.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.140
He's got problems.

24:44.340 --> 24:45.620
But he's obviously...

24:50.140 --> 24:52.500
Promise me you won't
do anything to him.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.740
It's not just me.

24:53.940 --> 24:56.220
Promise, or I go back to the car.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.540
All right, I promise.

25:00.740 --> 25:02.900
I'll tell Rocky.

25:19.220 --> 25:22.420
Can't wait to get her on the river
and start paddling.

25:22.620 --> 25:25.540
- Hey, Rock, you wanna go untie us?
- Sure.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.900
- There any life jackets?
- No, I don't think we'll need them.

25:37.100 --> 25:40.180
Come on, sweetheart.
Gotta learn to live life on the edge.

25:41.780 --> 25:43.020
He doesn't smoke, Marty.

25:44.340 --> 25:46.740
Why don't you speak
for yourself, faggot?

25:48.620 --> 25:50.940
I gotta keep my eye on you.

25:53.860 --> 25:56.380
These are really strong.

25:56.580 --> 25:59.220
Come on, Rock,
he's not such a bad guy.

25:59.420 --> 26:01.700
He's acting like a nice guy, Sam.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.780
In reality, he's not.

26:05.180 --> 26:06.740
You a...

26:07.780 --> 26:10.140
You a cigarette virgin, George?

26:10.900 --> 26:13.100
No. No, I'm not, man.

26:13.300 --> 26:14.940
I've smoked before.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.500
I... No, I once cold smoked

26:17.700 --> 26:19.580
an entire pack
of American Spirit Menthols.

26:19.780 --> 26:21.900
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:24.540 --> 26:27.900
What if I told you American Spirit
doesn't make menthols?

26:28.260 --> 26:29.220
They don't?

26:29.420 --> 26:32.020
It's OK if you've never
smoked before, George. I never have.

26:32.420 --> 26:35.100
Well, I have.
All right, I'm not lying.

26:36.540 --> 26:39.340
You know, maybe they weren't
menthols, but they were definitely

26:39.540 --> 26:41.780
- American Spirits.
- Right.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.700
The only reason why
he's being nice to us

26:44.900 --> 26:48.660
is because he sees this as
an opportunity to get something.

26:48.860 --> 26:51.220
To get friends.
Everybody wants that.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.140
OK, what if you were
his friend, Sam?

26:54.180 --> 26:56.980
I mean, he'd still go around school,
beating everybody else up.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.900
And that's actually
if you'd be his friend.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.180
I don't care what you say.
I don't wanna do it.

27:01.380 --> 27:03.180
- Millie thinks it's a bad idea too.
- Oh, well, if Millie thinks...

27:03.380 --> 27:06.020
- Millie thinks what's a bad idea?
- Nothing.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.780
You pansies untie the knot yet?

27:10.020 --> 27:11.820
Chop, chop, come on.

27:15.060 --> 27:16.100
Hey.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.740
Hey, Rock, you know,
I got a knife

27:18.940 --> 27:21.500
that'll slice through that
like butter.

27:21.700 --> 27:22.820
That's OK, George.

27:23.020 --> 27:24.700
I think we got it.

27:24.900 --> 27:26.620
Well, it's got, like, a bone saw,

27:26.820 --> 27:28.860
scissor, pick ax,
I mean, everything.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.980
It's OK, George.

27:32.260 --> 27:33.620
OK.

27:45.380 --> 27:47.580
I'll talk to Marty about it, OK?

27:47.780 --> 27:49.620
Give me your oar.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.220
- Nice.
- Thank you, George.

27:56.420 --> 27:58.020
Yeah, I once skipped
a rock on this lake,

27:58.220 --> 28:00.580
it skipped, like,
a thousand times.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.580
Let's get her in the water.

28:03.780 --> 28:05.900
Aye, aye, capitan.

28:07.580 --> 28:10.100
Calling off the plan.
I'll tell you later.

28:12.820 --> 28:14.780
It's all taken care of.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.780
Hey! You guys should take
your shoes off

28:22.980 --> 28:24.380
if you don't want
to get them wet.

28:24.580 --> 28:27.540
Too late. They're soaked.

28:29.780 --> 28:31.300
This is gonna be fun,
don't you think?

28:31.500 --> 28:33.980
Yeah. But whoever didn't
bring life jackets

28:34.180 --> 28:36.580
on a boat trip's a moron.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.900
Hey, you know
I have athlete's foot?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.940
- Get in.
- You are so disgusting.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.500
Oh, my gosh.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.580
Row, two, three, four!

29:17.500 --> 29:19.980
One, two, three, four...

29:43.940 --> 29:47.220
Sam loves it, don't you lie

29:49.380 --> 29:50.860
Rocky is a pimp

29:51.700 --> 29:53.620
Clyde is a fag

29:54.460 --> 29:56.340
Yeah, you love it, don't you?

29:57.700 --> 29:59.620
He spit all over the lens.

30:00.260 --> 30:03.580
Shut up, Rocky, this is
what's gonna get me on MTV.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.940
You need go-go dancers.

30:10.700 --> 30:12.620
This is expensive.

30:12.820 --> 30:15.140
OK, now you have to stop.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.660
Send your donations
to George Tooney, Oregon.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.780
Love one.

30:21.980 --> 30:25.020
I always thought I was really
talented in that sense.

30:25.220 --> 30:27.380
You agree, right? Up top.
Maybe later.

30:38.620 --> 30:41.180
I'm glad the way
this day's turning out.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.100
It's a nice day.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.060
Yeah, if nothing else,
it's a nice day.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.540
Can you guys taste
how sweet the air is?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.700
Smells like cherry blossom.

30:56.900 --> 31:00.060
How do you know what
cherry blossoms smell like, George?

31:02.420 --> 31:04.180
It's obvious.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.420
I don't know.

31:06.620 --> 31:08.900
What is a cherry blossom?

31:09.100 --> 31:11.620
It's the blossom on a cherry.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.180
No, I thought it was
its own kind of plant.

31:13.380 --> 31:14.940
What do you think, Marty?

31:15.140 --> 31:17.260
I think I'm bored as fuck.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.460
I also think I got some more beer
in my pack.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.060
- Anyone want one?
- Yeah.

31:21.860 --> 31:24.860
- You drinking, Sammy?
- Yeah, sure.

31:25.060 --> 31:26.580
I thought you...
Didn't you want a beer?

31:40.940 --> 31:42.780
Hey, Sammy.

31:43.620 --> 31:46.180
If you're really feeling
like a party animal...

31:47.860 --> 31:49.180
...you wanna smoke
a birthday doobie?

31:49.380 --> 31:51.780
Sam doesn't smoke weed, Marty.

31:51.980 --> 31:53.780
- Rocky, chill out.
- There's younger people

31:53.980 --> 31:57.100
- on this trip, Marty.
- All right, fuck-face, calm down.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.540
- I've been stoned before.
- Oh, yeah?

31:59.740 --> 32:03.780
Yeah. Yeah. I smoked a whole blunt
myself once. Yup.

32:03.980 --> 32:06.620
I... I hallucinated that there was...

32:06.820 --> 32:08.500
There was a little blue guy
on my shoulder,

32:08.700 --> 32:10.780
fucking tap dancing.

32:10.980 --> 32:12.580
But, no, I don't smoke weed
after that,

32:12.780 --> 32:16.180
because, like, my doctor says
it stunts your growth.

32:16.380 --> 32:19.180
- So I'm waiting until I'm 24.
- Yeah.

32:19.380 --> 32:21.620
Because, you know, that's when
you stop growing.

32:27.180 --> 32:29.860
Have you ever been stoned, Millie?

32:30.060 --> 32:32.700
Would you please get that
out of my face?

32:36.140 --> 32:38.220
All right, go ahead, turn it off.

32:51.660 --> 32:53.820
Sure is a beautiful river.

32:56.780 --> 32:58.460
Oh, you guys, look!

32:59.780 --> 33:01.380
- What?
- What?

33:02.660 --> 33:03.820
What?

33:04.020 --> 33:06.660
I thought I saw a water snake.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.540
Sam.

33:47.940 --> 33:49.180
Millie.

33:49.380 --> 33:50.780
Thanks.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.580
- Here.
- Thanks.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.220
All that boating really gets
your appetite up.

33:59.980 --> 34:01.900
You've just been sitting in the boat.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.860
I've been shifting my weight
the whole time,

34:04.060 --> 34:05.220
trying to keep us level.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.100
Yeah, you've really been
working hard.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.780
As if your pussy ass
has been doing anything.

34:16.540 --> 34:18.300
Did you make these yourself?

34:19.460 --> 34:23.260
You'II... You'll have to give me
the recipe sometime.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.580
It's peanut butter and jelly.

34:38.620 --> 34:40.500
Oh, yeah.

34:40.739 --> 34:43.420
Nothing beats a good piss
in the river.

34:43.940 --> 34:45.580
Except, of course,
a good romping session

34:45.780 --> 34:48.179
of a stupid, ugly, dumb,
pathetic piece of shit.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.179
- Yeah, we gotta talk about that.
- Yeah?

34:51.699 --> 34:53.500
What's to talk about?

34:54.780 --> 34:56.580
I want to call it off.

34:56.780 --> 34:58.580
I'm not laughing.

34:58.980 --> 35:00.460
I'm dead serious.

35:00.660 --> 35:02.100
Wait a minute.

35:02.340 --> 35:04.500
First, you get me all juiced up.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.780
You make me steal my mom's car.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.620
You get me out here
on a Saturday

35:08.820 --> 35:10.940
when I could be at home
watching TV.

35:11.140 --> 35:12.740
- Marty, come on.
- Then you have me steering

35:12.940 --> 35:15.580
the fucking Titanic all across the river
with a bunch of munchkins

35:15.780 --> 35:19.300
who are totally sober
and bringing me down.

35:20.460 --> 35:22.340
Now, you mean to tell me
we don't even get to do

35:22.540 --> 35:23.980
what we came out here for?

35:24.180 --> 35:26.060
I had no idea the guy
was gonna turn out so nice.

35:26.260 --> 35:28.660
Check it out, Rock,
he's not nice!

35:28.860 --> 35:32.060
He's a spoiled, retarded punk
who beat up your brother.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.020
OK, maybe I feel a little sorry
for him now.

35:34.220 --> 35:35.740
OK, well, then I'm gonna
give you two choices:

35:35.940 --> 35:37.860
You're either hard as hell
and you're yanking my chain,

35:38.060 --> 35:39.260
or you're the limpest dick
I've ever met in my life.

35:39.460 --> 35:41.700
- Everyone wants to call it off.
- Well, everyone is a vagina!

35:41.900 --> 35:44.500
You don't even have
a real grudge against him.

35:46.700 --> 35:48.660
If you were any kind
of a good brother,

35:48.860 --> 35:51.140
you wouldn't let Sammy boy
get the shit kicked out of him

35:51.340 --> 35:54.100
and then stroke the beater-upper's dick
all day long.

35:54.300 --> 35:57.140
- Just remember the plan's off.
- Yeah.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.540
I just wonder if,
when push came to shove,

36:01.740 --> 36:03.380
if you'd have my back.

36:07.340 --> 36:09.140
Hey, Clyde.

36:09.340 --> 36:12.180
Remember when you were in the
fourth grade, and I was in third, and I...

36:12.420 --> 36:14.460
I smacked you across the face
with a bat?

36:14.660 --> 36:17.340
- How could I forget?
- Maybe you had that thing

36:17.540 --> 36:19.420
where you forget
from getting hit in the head.

36:19.620 --> 36:21.500
- Amnesia?
- Yeah.

36:21.700 --> 36:24.860
Anyway, I was trying to remember.

36:25.060 --> 36:27.060
- Why'd I do it?
- I don't know.

36:27.260 --> 36:29.340
You must've done something.

36:29.540 --> 36:31.660
No, I never do anything to anybody.

36:31.860 --> 36:33.620
That's stupid.
Of course you do.

36:33.820 --> 36:36.540
Look, it's not stupid, George.
You just attacked me.

36:36.740 --> 36:38.460
A kid doesn't just attack
for no reason.

36:38.660 --> 36:40.500
You always attack for no reason.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.980
I know it's your birthday, Sam,
but shut your trap.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.660
Hey! You pussies done
with your sammies?

36:56.900 --> 36:58.460
Does it look like we're done
with our sandwiches?

36:58.660 --> 37:00.540
Yeah, I'm gonna get the boat
back in the water.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.660
You ladies can join me
whenever you want.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.540
Why'd you drop the anchor?

37:36.340 --> 37:38.260
Because I felt like it.

37:53.260 --> 37:54.820
Hey, Sammy.

37:55.020 --> 37:58.340
What you say we bust out
that Stream Machine.

37:58.700 --> 38:01.620
- Yeah, OK.
- Clyde, can you give it to me?

38:11.580 --> 38:12.900
All right.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.300
Put that away.

38:17.940 --> 38:21.580
All right, first, we must charge
the propulsion system.

38:22.820 --> 38:25.980
And then take aim
and run a preliminary test.

38:26.180 --> 38:27.420
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

38:27.620 --> 38:29.820
Don't fucking squirt
that thing at me again!

38:40.860 --> 38:43.740
Hey, what do you guys say
we play some Truth or Dare?

38:43.940 --> 38:45.980
Yeah. Yeah, I love that game.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.220
- OK, then, let's do it.
- Let's not.

38:48.420 --> 38:51.060
People's feelings always end up hurt
when we play this game.

38:51.260 --> 38:52.460
Yeah, she's right.

38:52.660 --> 38:54.300
God, Sam and Millie

38:54.500 --> 38:57.780
are a couple of little
wet pussies, aren't they?

39:01.340 --> 39:02.820
Clyde, do you wanna start?

39:03.020 --> 39:06.260
I don't know. I'm kind of with
Millie and Sam on this one.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.340
Pussy number one,
pussy number two,

39:10.500 --> 39:11.700
pussy number three.

39:14.460 --> 39:17.620
Go ahead, Clyde. Start the game.

39:23.540 --> 39:24.980
OK, then.

39:27.380 --> 39:29.900
Rocky, truth or dare?

39:30.980 --> 39:32.220
Truth.

39:32.420 --> 39:34.540
All right, I want you to tell us,

39:35.700 --> 39:37.580
in 20 words or more,

39:37.780 --> 39:40.140
what you were thinking
the last time you beat off.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.540
Susie Johnson.

39:45.740 --> 39:49.220
But that's...
That's not even 20 words.

39:49.420 --> 39:50.980
It's, like, two.

39:54.380 --> 39:57.500
OK, I imagined that
she followed me into the locker room,

39:57.700 --> 39:58.940
went into the stall.

39:59.140 --> 40:01.580
She got on her knees.
I sat on the toilet.

40:01.780 --> 40:04.660
- That's 20.
- All right, Rocky, it's your turn.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.740
OK, Sammy. Truth or dare?

40:11.780 --> 40:13.140
Dare.

40:14.820 --> 40:17.980
I dare you to French kiss
Millie for ten seconds.

40:18.180 --> 40:19.860
Man.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.540
It's pretty exciting.

40:22.740 --> 40:24.940
- It's OK.
- What? It's OK.

40:25.140 --> 40:27.740
Wait, did you hear that?
It's OK.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.740
She wants it.

40:31.940 --> 40:33.340
This is what I paid for? Come on!

40:33.540 --> 40:35.100
- Come on!
- Let's go!

40:35.300 --> 40:36.420
I want my money back.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.460
OK. There you go.

40:38.660 --> 40:41.460
There you go! Ten.

40:41.660 --> 40:43.100
Nine,

40:43.300 --> 40:45.580
eight, seven,

40:45.780 --> 40:47.940
six, five,

40:48.140 --> 40:50.420
four, three,

40:50.620 --> 40:52.460
two...

40:56.580 --> 40:59.580
Oh, shit. Oh, man.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.140
Yo, Rock. Rock, I just had
an amazing flash

41:04.340 --> 41:08.540
of what your brother and Millie would
look like all hot and bothered in bed.

41:09.540 --> 41:11.100
- That's gross.
- Sammy, go. It's your turn.

41:11.300 --> 41:14.060
Wait, wait, maybe... Maybe we
shouldn't call him Sammy anymore.

41:14.260 --> 41:16.980
Maybe we should call him
"lover boy."

41:19.300 --> 41:20.700
OK, then.

41:20.900 --> 41:22.300
Marty.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.900
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.460
All right.

41:26.820 --> 41:29.660
I dare you to pull down
your pants and your underwear,

41:29.860 --> 41:32.820
and show us that famous dick of yours
for at least ten seconds.

41:33.020 --> 41:35.220
Ten seconds.
Wow, you are a killer, Sam.

41:35.420 --> 41:36.780
All right, I will do it,

41:36.980 --> 41:40.500
because I am proud of my boys.
But if I do,

41:40.700 --> 41:43.540
I don't want anyone else
wimping out on their dares.

41:43.780 --> 41:45.420
So let's see the penis.

41:45.620 --> 41:48.340
- Bring on the penis!
- All right.

41:48.940 --> 41:52.060
Millie, close your eyes.
Marty doesn't want to go to jail.

41:52.780 --> 41:54.500
No cameras.

41:56.020 --> 41:57.540
We ready?

42:01.860 --> 42:03.140
That's sick.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.340
- Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
- Oh! OK. OK.

42:06.540 --> 42:09.060
All right.
You fucking asshole.

42:12.700 --> 42:15.460
- It was hairy as a chimp!
- Yeah, was it?

42:15.660 --> 42:17.100
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

42:17.300 --> 42:18.980
It looked like a giant frog.

42:19.180 --> 42:21.980
All right, assholes.
That was pretty funny, douche bag.

42:22.180 --> 42:23.540
- At first I thought it was all deformed,
- Thank you.

42:23.740 --> 42:25.860
- Because it was just so fucking ugly.
- OK. All right.

42:26.060 --> 42:27.980
Have you gotten out
all your stupid chuckles yet?

42:28.180 --> 42:30.340
Have I gotten out all
my stupid chuckles? No!

42:30.540 --> 42:33.340
All right. Well, whenever you're done,
let me know, because it's my turn next.

42:33.540 --> 42:35.940
"Whenever you're done, let me know,
because it's my turn next."

42:36.140 --> 42:37.500
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, well, what are you doing?

42:37.700 --> 42:39.140
- Stop imitating me.
- "Stop imitating me."

42:39.340 --> 42:40.540
- Enough is enough!
- "Enough is enough!"

42:40.740 --> 42:43.340
Is that what your dad says to you?

42:47.540 --> 42:48.980
You don't know shit about my father.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.900
If you ever say anything
about my father again, I will kill you.

42:52.100 --> 42:54.220
Do you understand?

42:59.100 --> 43:00.380
Marty, I...

43:00.580 --> 43:03.220
I was just messing around with you.

43:04.220 --> 43:06.100
OK, messing boy.

43:07.260 --> 43:09.700
I dare you to strip butt naked
and jump in the river.

43:09.900 --> 43:11.740
Marty, leave him alone.

43:12.620 --> 43:14.420
I did my dare.

43:14.620 --> 43:17.100
Now he does his.
Those are the rules, Clyde.

43:17.300 --> 43:19.380
Marty, why don't you
just calm down?

43:19.580 --> 43:22.260
- OK, the game's over.
- The game'll be over in a minute!

43:23.780 --> 43:27.500
Right after fat-ass here takes
his clothes off and gets in the bath.

43:31.460 --> 43:33.860
Chill out, Marty, all right?

43:34.300 --> 43:36.780
Because you know what?
I didn't even pick dare, all right?

43:36.980 --> 43:38.020
I pick truth.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.700
You want a truth?

43:41.900 --> 43:44.380
OK, I'll give you a truth.

43:45.620 --> 43:48.900
The truth is, lard-fart,

43:49.300 --> 43:52.180
is that we didn't invite you out here
because we've been secretly in love

43:52.420 --> 43:54.620
- with you all these years.
- Marty, don't do this.

43:54.820 --> 43:57.740
We invited you out here
because you smacked Sammy boy

43:57.940 --> 43:59.980
- right there in the cranium.
- Marty, stop.

44:00.180 --> 44:03.460
So we came up with a plan
to mess you up.

44:05.260 --> 44:07.180
Is that true, Sam?

44:09.700 --> 44:11.140
Yeah.

44:11.820 --> 44:13.940
But then we changed our minds
because we liked you.

44:14.660 --> 44:16.540
Wait, you...? You tricked me?

44:16.740 --> 44:18.460
Yes, we tricked you.

44:18.660 --> 44:20.740
And, yes, all these suckers here
changed their minds,

44:20.940 --> 44:22.900
but I didn't change mine.

44:23.740 --> 44:27.500
I'm a man who likes to
follow through with his plans.

44:35.460 --> 44:37.140
What have you been planning?

44:42.300 --> 44:44.020
We were planning
on stripping you,

44:44.220 --> 44:47.140
throwing you in the river,
then making you run home naked.

44:49.300 --> 44:52.460
- It's not funny.
- Oh, it's super-duper funny to me.

44:58.140 --> 45:00.100
- I'm sorry, George.
- You're not sorry!

45:00.300 --> 45:02.140
I'm sorry.

45:07.140 --> 45:09.900
Is...? Is it even your birthday?

45:10.100 --> 45:11.580
No.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.340
You're a fucking lying
son of a bitch, Sam!

45:17.540 --> 45:19.580
All right? And I hope you
fucking go to hell!

45:19.780 --> 45:22.220
- Don't make things worse, George.
- Shut the fuck up, Millie.

45:22.420 --> 45:24.340
You fucking stupid JAP cunt!

45:24.580 --> 45:26.140
Sit down, George.
You're out of control.

45:26.340 --> 45:28.780
Shut the fuck up, Clyde!
You faggot!

45:28.980 --> 45:31.020
Fucking skinny,
butt-munching faggot!

45:31.220 --> 45:32.980
I hate you, you know that?
I really do!

45:33.180 --> 45:35.300
Because all you do is
fucking prance around school,

45:35.500 --> 45:37.820
talking about your fucking
faggoty, fairy fathers!

45:38.020 --> 45:39.660
I'll tell you what!
I don't want to hear

45:39.860 --> 45:42.380
about your fucking fathers
and how their assholes work.

45:42.580 --> 45:44.260
All right? It makes me sick!

45:44.460 --> 45:48.060
And I... I fucking hope they
fucking die of fag disease!

45:49.740 --> 45:51.220
Yeah!

45:56.020 --> 46:00.140
And... And speaking
of dead fathers...

46:01.380 --> 46:04.340
...I just remembered
why bonehead, white-trash,

46:04.540 --> 46:07.460
fucking donkey-dick Marty
got so fucking freaked

46:07.660 --> 46:10.580
when I started talking
about his daddy.

46:11.940 --> 46:15.220
His Neanderthal

46:15.460 --> 46:18.340
drunk dad put a gun in his mouth

46:18.540 --> 46:22.260
and splattered his brains
all over the wall.

46:25.700 --> 46:29.980
You know, I almost forgot
that my mom told me that.

46:30.180 --> 46:34.020
She said, "His daddy splattered
his brains all over the wall."

46:34.220 --> 46:38.620
I thought it was sad at first.
But, now, I like it.

46:39.420 --> 46:41.620
His daddy splattered
his brains

46:41.820 --> 46:43.820
all over the wall.

46:44.020 --> 46:46.380
- His daddy splattered his brains
- Shut up, George.

46:46.580 --> 46:49.060
- All over the wall.
- George, come on. Shut up.

46:49.260 --> 46:51.220
His daddy splattered his brains
all over the wall!

46:51.420 --> 46:53.940
- Stop it, George!
- All over the wall!

46:54.140 --> 46:55.940
- His daddy splattered his brains
- No one talks to people like that.

46:56.140 --> 46:58.940
- All over the wall!
- Shut the fuck up, George!

46:59.140 --> 47:01.500
- Shut the fuck up!
- All over the wall!

47:01.700 --> 47:04.460
All over the wall!
His daddy splattered his brains

47:04.660 --> 47:06.020
- Shut up!
- All over the wall!

47:06.220 --> 47:07.420
- Marty!
- Stop it!

47:07.620 --> 47:10.020
- Marty! George!
- All over the wall!

47:10.220 --> 47:11.900
Shut the fuck up!

47:14.180 --> 47:15.500
- Help! Help!
- That's what happens

47:15.700 --> 47:17.340
when you fuck with Martini Blank!

47:17.540 --> 47:20.380
- Help, help! Please!
- Martini Blank's friends back him up.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.740
- That's what friends do, fuck-o.
- Help!

47:23.940 --> 47:26.540
- Help! Help! Help!
- That's why you're in the water.

47:26.980 --> 47:30.260
- Because you've got none.
- Help! Fucker!

47:35.300 --> 47:36.260
Help!

47:36.460 --> 47:38.300
Help! Help!

47:41.780 --> 47:44.060
Help! Help!

47:52.660 --> 47:53.820
Please help.

48:06.620 --> 48:08.020
Shit, you guys,
he's not coming up!

49:21.660 --> 49:23.220
Help!

49:23.860 --> 49:26.940
Guys, help, now! Hurry!

49:32.180 --> 49:33.340
Get him up.

49:34.860 --> 49:36.180
George.

49:39.300 --> 49:41.700
- Oh, shit.
- Do you know what you're doing?

49:41.900 --> 49:44.340
One, two, three, four...

49:44.580 --> 49:46.420
Help!

49:47.260 --> 49:48.900
Help!

49:51.140 --> 49:52.980
Help!

49:53.500 --> 49:55.300
Can anyone help us?

49:58.260 --> 50:00.660
- Help!
- One, two, three, four.

50:00.860 --> 50:03.220
One, two, three, four.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.940
Come on.

50:08.500 --> 50:10.700
Wake up. Come on, wake up!

50:15.460 --> 50:16.980
Wake up.

50:18.180 --> 50:19.580
Shit.

50:20.980 --> 50:22.580
Wake up!

50:23.900 --> 50:25.220
Wake up!

50:25.420 --> 50:28.220
Wake up! God, wake up!

50:32.060 --> 50:33.900
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

50:34.100 --> 50:35.380
Wake up, wake up!

50:35.580 --> 50:38.300
Wake up! Wake up,
wake up, wake up!

50:38.500 --> 50:40.020
Wake up!

53:39.540 --> 53:41.940
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you!

53:45.980 --> 53:49.060
We can never be forgiven
for what we did.

53:49.980 --> 53:52.220
You didn't do anything.

53:53.180 --> 53:54.660
I don't wanna be here.

53:54.860 --> 53:57.260
I don't wanna be here.

53:57.700 --> 54:00.380
I wanted to kill him before
I threw him over. Now he's dead.

54:00.540 --> 54:02.420
Maybe this was his time to go.

54:02.620 --> 54:04.540
Maybe it was his fate.

54:05.100 --> 54:07.220
Why would it be his fate?

54:08.540 --> 54:11.220
Because everything happens
for a reason, Rock.

54:11.900 --> 54:13.340
I don't know.

54:28.100 --> 54:29.980
I'm sorry.

54:32.300 --> 54:34.140
I'm sorry.

54:37.500 --> 54:38.860
I'm sorry.

55:34.700 --> 55:36.940
Anybody know what time it is?

55:49.580 --> 55:52.260
What if we say
we were playing Truth or Dare,

55:52.860 --> 55:55.460
and then we dared him
to jump into the river,

55:55.660 --> 55:58.460
and he did, and he drowned.

56:05.100 --> 56:06.460
What the hell are you doing?

56:06.620 --> 56:08.380
Looking for his fucking
video camera.

56:09.180 --> 56:11.700
If it gets found, then everybody
finds out what we did.

56:11.900 --> 56:13.180
Everyone's gonna find out
what we did,

56:13.340 --> 56:15.020
regardless if the video camera
gets found, Marty.

56:15.220 --> 56:17.300
Not if we don't want them to.

56:18.860 --> 56:20.700
Are you joking?

56:20.900 --> 56:23.260
Look, this was a prank that went
wrong. We come completely clean.

56:23.420 --> 56:27.020
No one's got a ton of sympathy
for guys who throw fat kids in the river.

56:27.220 --> 56:30.100
All right? If we turn ourselves in,
we're all screwed.

56:30.780 --> 56:33.020
What do you think's
gonna happen, Marty?

56:33.220 --> 56:35.740
Superman's gonna fly around
Earth and turn back time?

56:35.940 --> 56:41.340
No. I don't think Superman's
going to turn back time.

56:44.340 --> 56:45.660
Think we gotta bury the body.

57:04.020 --> 57:06.460
Rocky, if we bury the body, it's gonna
look like we did it on purpose.

57:06.660 --> 57:09.540
If we bury the body,
we're not gonna look like anything.

57:09.740 --> 57:11.860
Out of sight, out of mind.

57:12.060 --> 57:14.900
Yeah, well, maybe out of your mind,
you stupid fuck.

57:22.420 --> 57:24.780
Look, we just committed
a major fucking crime.

57:24.980 --> 57:27.180
And if any one of us cracks,
we are all gonna be screwed.

57:27.380 --> 57:30.340
Look, it was an accident. Kids like us
have accidents all the time.

57:30.540 --> 57:32.700
This wasn't just an accident.

57:32.900 --> 57:35.860
All right? We schemed this,
from the beginning.

57:36.060 --> 57:39.260
All right, so fine, we schemed.
No one has to know that.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.380
They're gonna figure it out.

57:41.900 --> 57:45.460
Somebody's bound to crack when
they start asking a million questions.

57:45.660 --> 57:47.540
Put Sammy boy in a lie detector.

57:47.740 --> 57:50.060
Look, the idea
of burying the body is nuts.

57:50.260 --> 57:52.060
Going to jail
and getting raped every night

57:52.260 --> 57:55.420
for the rest of your cute,
little, fucking lives is nuts.

57:55.580 --> 57:57.620
I think you're nuts.

58:32.100 --> 58:33.740
So that's it?

58:33.940 --> 58:37.180
We're just gonna pretend
like we're all innocent.

58:38.860 --> 58:41.300
- Shut up.
- No.

58:41.500 --> 58:43.540
- Shut up.
- No!

58:44.220 --> 58:46.420
If you've got a better idea,
then you better spit it out

58:46.620 --> 58:49.340
- because no one else does.
- Marty, come on.

58:49.500 --> 58:51.980
- Do you have one?
- Shit, Marty. Get off. Come on.

58:52.180 --> 58:55.060
If you've got a better idea,
I'll listen. Do you?

58:55.260 --> 58:56.540
- No.
- Then do you agree

58:56.740 --> 58:58.940
that we have to go
with the best idea we've got?

59:00.180 --> 59:02.940
Yes. Get off.

59:12.140 --> 59:15.020
You always gotta go
with the best idea you've got.

59:17.180 --> 59:19.020
Otherwise you're just left

59:19.220 --> 59:22.740
laying around
not knowing what to do.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.580
I can't do it.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.540
It's not safe.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.220
It's a big joke anyway.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.740
I think that's deep enough.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.820
Hey, you guys wanna help?

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.100
First thing we gotta do
when we get back

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.220
is deal with Jasper
and my brother.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.340
How?

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.460
Gotta make sure they forget
they ever saw George with us.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.940
What the fuck
you gonna do? Huh?

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.660
Hit them over the head with a rock,
hope they get amnesia?

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.540
Thanks.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.740
All right, this is the way
it's gonna work.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.500
We drop everybody off
at their houses.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.620
Everybody's gonna sit tight
until I go make sure

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.140
everything's "copathetic"
with Kile and Jasper.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.980
The word's copacetic, Marty.

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.300
Yeah.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.340
Millie...

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.460
...mum's the word.

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.940
Peg, can I get the phone?

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:33.940
Shit.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.300
- Kile?
- Hey, Marty.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.140
- What's cooking?
- Hey, you little fucker.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.740
How'd the cow spanking go?

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.460
What?

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.460
Looks fantastic.

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.780
You OK?

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.340
You look a little...

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.540
No, I'm fine.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:13.100
Clyde, if something's up,
it's OK to tell us about it.

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.580
This is so fucked.

01:08:26.779 --> 01:08:28.100
Fuck!

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.979
I don't even know...

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:43.819
I don't even know.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.060
Hey.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.819
Maybe you guys
could take me home?

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.939
Wish we knew what to do.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.460
We know what to do.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.859
You know what we did, Rocky.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.340
What are you trying to say, Sam?

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:54.620
You have to trust me
on this one, Sam.

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.420
I'm your big brother.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.500
But I don't trust you.

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.300
Where you going?

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.660
What do you want?

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.540
To talk.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.260
We have nothing to talk about.

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:21.900
It was your guys' plan.
I was just there.

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.980
That doesn't mean
I have to tell on you.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.420
And that's your problem.

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:30.060
Are you done?

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.660
Can I come in?

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:03.020
Do you remember when you said
we could never be forgiven?

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.460
That might be right.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:12.980
I don't know.

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:18.820
The only thing I do know is that
I'm not sure about anything.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:22.020
What do you want us to do?

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.100
Go back and unbury the body?

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.380
He's dead.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.060
You know...

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.100
...when we graduate
high school

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:40.300
and go to college and become doctors
and lawyers and all that...

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.580
...what do you think it'd be like?

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.220
- Hey.
- Hey, Marty.

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.940
- Good to see you.
- How you doing, Mr. Maris?

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.740
- How are you?
- I'm good.

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.660
Are...?
Is Rocky and Sam home?

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.380
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The whole gang's here.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.060
They're listening to music
in the bedroom there.

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:41.940
- Do you mind if...? Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.060
What's going on here?

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.420
Why don't you sit down?

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.900
What, so I go off to make sure
all our business is taken care of,

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.140
and all of a sudden
you guys form a new club?

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:14.260
- We've come to a decision.
- You've come to a decision?

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.980
What, are you kidding me?

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.900
We already decided.
I talked to Jasper and Kile.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.020
They're not gonna say anything.

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.300
Everything is going to be OK.

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.780
No. Everything is not
gonna be OK.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.580
So, what?

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.300
All you guys decide to squeal
or something?

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.060
We have to, Marty.
It's the only way...

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.700
No, there is no "only way", Sam.
That's crap.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.860
OK? You know that's crap.

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:00.380
All right.

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.380
Screw all of you, then.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.140
- Marty, hang on.
- No!

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.980
- Where you going?
- Away from you.

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.140
You suck.

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.380
You know that, right?

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:27.420
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know, drive to Mexico.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.820
What do you think?

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.700
I don't know what to think.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.340
Well, if you don't know
what to think,

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.500
then you probably shouldn't
be making decisions.

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:24.540
What do you think about
letting me borrow your gun?

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.900
- Hey.
- Yeah.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.780
Easy, man.

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:30.020
He was saying terrible things.

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.500
Things that shouldn't
have been said.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:42.900
When your brother
knocked George overboard...

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.940
...would you say he was

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.300
in control

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.660
or out of control?

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.460
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.860
Excuse me, Sam.

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:14.020
Never seen him
more out of control in my life.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.940
My name is George.

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:51.180
And this...

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:56.180
...is the inside of my mind.

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:04.700
The inside of my mind
has a zillion things.

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:31.940
The inside of my mind
has a zillion things about it.

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.140
But...

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:37.420
...people that don't
see inside my mind

01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:41.780
don't know there are
a zillion things and...

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.500
You know, since no one
sees inside my mind,

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.020
no one really knows.

01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.300
But...

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.940
...one day people will know.

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:10.700
One day people will know
because that's my master plan.

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:19.100
To film it all.

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:24.980
To document every aspect
of the life that is me.

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:28.900
And put it in a time capsule
in my back yard.

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:32.500
And so that one day, some...

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.940
...alien,
or some highly evolved species,

01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.940
will find it and...

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.100
understand.
