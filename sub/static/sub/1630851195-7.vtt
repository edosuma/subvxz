01:50.319 --> 01:52.446
When you do a show five days a week,

01:52.529 --> 01:55.824
52 weeks a year,
they are not always going to be perfect.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.871
There are going to be warts.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.956
There are going to be imperfections.

02:03.040 --> 02:07.002
So you have to embrace the warts.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.464
The warts need to become
a part of the show.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.216
Can't be precious about it.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.934
You see people come. You see people go.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.816
And you realize
how replaceable everyone really is.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.118
I was there 15 years.

02:40.994 --> 02:45.874
I had to pretend to be amused
by four different meteorologists.

02:51.380 --> 02:56.093
And then you realize that
you're the replaceable one.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.933
For the time being,
they've been deemed necessary.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.270
Again, Cyril, they are trying to strike
that very delicate balance between

03:06.353 --> 03:09.147
making sure that they prevent the spread
of this virus…

03:09.231 --> 03:10.566
Oh, my God.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.317
…in a country in a part of the world

03:12.401 --> 03:14.820
that so far
hadn't had to deal with this epidemic

03:14.903 --> 03:18.574
-without sowing the seeds of panic--
-It's Armageddon.

03:18.657 --> 03:21.910
We're all gonna die. Unbelievable.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.788
-It is.
-End of the world.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.456
God.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.462
I should get home. Be with my kids.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.424
When are you leaving?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.886
Well, I can't right now.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.972
Travel wouldn't be a good idea.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.935
So I guess we have, what,
a couple days left on our two weeks?

03:47.019 --> 03:49.938
At least Italian authorities have insisted
that because they've been…

03:50.022 --> 03:52.065
-Is that okay?
-Okay, not okay,

03:52.149 --> 03:54.484
it doesn't make a difference.
I can't stop time.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.154
What I meant was I'm sorry.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.740
Don't apologize. It makes you look weak.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.494
Hey, Paola.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.414
…229 confirmed cases…

04:08.373 --> 04:09.458
What is it?

04:09.541 --> 04:12.085
…will continue to rise
with all the neighboring countries,

04:12.169 --> 04:14.004
given the open borders here in Europe…

04:14.796 --> 04:16.923
Since I'm leaving,
I want to ask you something.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.885
I've been thinking about it
for the last couple of days.

04:21.970 --> 04:27.518
But… I haven't been able
to find the right time to say it.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.021
But now that I'm going…

04:39.363 --> 04:41.615
Could you please delete my interview?

04:41.698 --> 04:45.661
…St. Mark's Square,
this early afternoon here in Venice.

04:46.370 --> 04:50.123
I know-- It's not that I don't trust you.

04:50.749 --> 04:51.750
Are you sure?

04:51.834 --> 04:53.126
Yes. Yes.

04:53.210 --> 04:57.506
That's exactly what
it seems you're saying.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.049
No, no. This isn't about you.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.551
I don't trust the world.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.135
This stuff gets out there.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.179
This doesn't have to be anybody's fault.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.849
You're still concerned about
what people think of you.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.517
Fuck yeah, I'm concerned.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.186
I don't want my kids seeing some
of the stuff in that interview.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.231
God forbid your kids think
you're a three-dimensional person.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.859
You know what?
The world doesn't want complex.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.403
They don't want complicated.
They want easily digestible--

05:19.486 --> 05:21.905
I'll delete the interview, all right?

05:21.989 --> 05:24.616
Nobody will ever know
your true thoughts or feelings.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.826
Just the way you like it.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.913
I'm gonna go get my computer,
and I'll come back,

05:29.997 --> 05:32.207
so you can see that I'm deleting it.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.751
You don't have to do it
in front of me. I trust you.

05:36.837 --> 05:41.508
…weren't any contact with people
who had returned from China anytime soon.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.494
-What are you doing here?
-Let me in.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.079
-I can't.
-You will.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.789
-You have to let me in.
-Alex.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.334
I was exposed to coronavirus.
I'm quarantining.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.169
-I don't care.
-It's not safe.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.964
I don't care.
I have been through hell to get here.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.674
Yeah, how did you get here?

06:22.758 --> 06:24.218
-How did you find me?
-Just let me in!

06:34.394 --> 06:36.939
Something's different.
Did you get a new limp?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.709
You spoke to Maggie Brener.
You spoke to Maggie Brener.

06:57.793 --> 06:58.919
You told her to fuck off!

06:59.002 --> 07:01.171
Why did you tell
Maggie Brener to fuck off?

07:01.255 --> 07:03.006
Isn't that what you wanted me to say?

07:03.090 --> 07:06.426
We didn't exactly part ways amicably,
and I told her to fuck off anyway.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.136
-But you didn't say no.
-Seriously,

07:08.220 --> 07:10.681
of all the things that you can be
mad at me about right now,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.266
me telling her to fuck off?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.935
You didn't say no! You did not say no.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.271
I wasn't going to dignify
it with a response.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.566
It's none of Maggie's fucking business.
It's nobody's fucking business.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.942
Why are you still such an idiot?

07:22.025 --> 07:24.111
Of course it's nobody's fucking business.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.863
But you did not deny it.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.657
You didn't say no. And now it's in a book.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.994
Is that why you're here?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.163
What do you want?

07:35.247 --> 07:39.418
I want you to tell everyone
that you and I did not have sex.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.254
So you tracked me down
and you flew to Italy?

07:42.337 --> 07:45.799
Yeah. I'm not gonna call you
or text or email you this.

07:45.883 --> 07:49.094
I don't want this fucking
conversation up in a cloud.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.971
It's a nine-hour flight, big fucking deal.

07:51.054 --> 07:54.892
It's a very simple price to pay not
to be associated with your dick.

07:56.435 --> 07:59.396
I think the best thing
you can do right now is to let it go,

07:59.479 --> 08:01.940
-and to not give it any air.
-Easy for you to say.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.609
I still have a fucking life.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.071
-Alex, I can't.
-No.

08:08.739 --> 08:09.907
You don't get to say no.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.076
You do not get to say-- Of all people,
you do not get to say no.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.828
You do not know what I have been through.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.247
I walked out on a debate.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.415
That was about me?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.210
No, it was about me.
But it was your fucking fault.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.754
-Hey, are you okay? Who died?
-Am I okay? No!

08:23.837 --> 08:24.838
Do you see me?

08:24.922 --> 08:27.382
Have you heard a fucking word
that I've said out there?

08:27.466 --> 08:30.677
I skipped town a week and a half
after I went back to the show.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.386
I no-showed a debate.

08:32.471 --> 08:37.476
I charter a plane into the middle
of a hot zone 4,000 miles away,

08:37.558 --> 08:40.145
and I didn't tell a fucking soul
where I was going.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.857
Does any of this seem like something
that someone who's okay would do?

08:45.275 --> 08:48.737
Well, I guess nobody is okay,
so you're in good company.

08:48.820 --> 08:52.658
Oh, God. Please.
Just put Philosophical Mitch away.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.743
He's not as smart as
you think he is, all right?

08:54.826 --> 08:56.578
I need you to release a statement.

08:56.662 --> 08:59.915
-You and me never happened.
-Alex, I'm done lying.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.208
You've got to be kidding me.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.378
Really? Now you're too good to lie?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.588
You're too good to lie
when it fucks up my life?

09:06.672 --> 09:09.758
Why do I have to lie?
Why is that going to fuck up your life?

09:09.842 --> 09:12.427
Because I lied on national television,

09:12.511 --> 09:14.012
when Laura Peterson

09:14.096 --> 09:16.807
just sideswiped me with
that fucking question about

09:16.890 --> 09:19.101
"What was the nature
of your relationship with Mitch Kessler?"

09:19.184 --> 09:21.728
You really think that
that's gonna fuck up your life?

09:21.812 --> 09:23.313
Being associated with me?

09:24.398 --> 09:27.067
Well, how's your life been going,
being associated with you?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.695
You lose your career?
Did your family fall apart?

09:29.778 --> 09:32.239
You've been ostracized by polite society?

09:32.739 --> 09:36.201
Does your life have any meaning
or purpose left at all?

09:38.370 --> 09:42.666
Nobody will respect me
if they think that I slept with you.

09:50.174 --> 09:51.216
Okay, I'll do it.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.598
You know, I've done a lot
of things that I regret.

09:58.307 --> 10:01.602
I've made some really bad decisions.
Things I'm not proud about.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.481
But, even though I feel remorse,

10:07.149 --> 10:11.195
I'm the person who did those things.
So I know that I am no angel.

10:12.779 --> 10:16.200
And here I thought that
you were doing this

10:16.825 --> 10:19.578
to keep Lizzy from knowing,

10:19.661 --> 10:22.289
or Jason from looking foolish,

10:22.372 --> 10:26.960
but it was the mere fact that having
consensual sex with me

10:27.044 --> 10:32.090
was so vile that it will end your life.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.054
I'll do it. I mean, it doesn't matter.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.140
It's fine. Is there anything else?

10:40.224 --> 10:42.935
Hey. Did you see
where I left my cigarettes?

10:46.647 --> 10:47.814
Hi.

10:48.857 --> 10:49.858
Hi.

10:57.950 --> 11:01.370
Never mind. I'll find them.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.248
Oh, man. What? Wow.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.625
It's unbelievable.
That's why you leave your kids?

11:08.502 --> 11:11.004
That's that crazy woman
from that video at the café.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.382
I didn't leave my kids.
I would never leave my kids.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.260
And you know that,
so spare me that fake outrage, Alex.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.845
I didn't know you brought them here.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.555
Are they here with you?
You should have told me.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.640
You couldn't be more wrong. First of all,

11:21.723 --> 11:24.810
-her name is Paola, and she is not crazy.
-I didn't ask.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.478
She's impressive and she's smart

11:26.562 --> 11:28.313
and we have a nice relationship

11:28.397 --> 11:31.275
-which I will not mess up with sex.
-Okay.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.735
-She's a documentarian.
-She's a documentarian.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.446
Yeah, she's a rather good one too.
She's naturally gifted.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.449
-I bet she's gifted.
-Okay, don't start.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.493
She's her own worst enemy,

11:41.577 --> 11:44.621
which is something I know
a little bit about, so I'm helping her.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.791
With your help, she can be
the next Leni Riefenstahl.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.752
Seriously, what, is this woman
a crusade for you of some kind?

11:50.836 --> 11:54.089
-You just decided to help her?
-Yeah, sure. That's it. Right.

11:54.173 --> 11:56.300
You know you're divorced
and you are allowed to date?

11:56.383 --> 11:59.761
I don't want to sully her with
the permanent stink of having fucked me.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.556
I would hate for her to become
the subject of a book.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.684
Yeah.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.561
So you'll release a statement?

12:09.521 --> 12:13.108
You know what? In fact,
I actually need you to call your publicist

12:13.192 --> 12:15.110
in front of me, and I need to hear it--

12:15.194 --> 12:16.528
My publicist dumped me.

12:16.612 --> 12:19.740
Well, yeah. That figures.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.910
Okay. Well, then you're gonna
need to write a letter,

12:22.993 --> 12:25.913
and I need to have a piece of paper
in my hand when I leave this house.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.789
-You wanna see me write a letter?
-I wanna see you write it.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.041
Okay.

12:29.124 --> 12:32.377
I did not

12:32.878 --> 12:36.798
-fuck Alex Levy.
-You're such a dick.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.801
Best regards,

12:39.885 --> 12:41.595
Mitch Kessler.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.056
-You want me to get this notarized?
-Cut the shit.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.516
No. I need a real statement.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.100
Just write me a real statement.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.770
Well, you know, these things usually
are transmitted electronically--

12:49.853 --> 12:53.023
I don't give a shit. I want to walk out
here with a piece of paper in my hand.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.441
Then you're gonna have to wait,

12:54.525 --> 12:56.276
because I'm going to have
to talk to my attorney,

12:56.360 --> 12:57.819
and we're going to have to send it to you.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.197
How am I supposed to know
you're telling me the truth?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.823
I guess you'll just have to trust me.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.493
All right. Then write your new number
on a piece of paper

13:04.576 --> 13:07.454
so I can check in
on if you've lied to me again.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.463
Have a nice life.

13:35.691 --> 13:36.942
Hey.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.277
How much of that did you hear?

13:38.360 --> 13:41.321
Some. You shouldn't leave it like that.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.533
It wouldn't have been my choice.

13:44.616 --> 13:45.826
It is your choice.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.669
Hey. I thought you were going.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.254
Can't get out of your fucking gate.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.424
Just take it as a sign, and why don't you
hang out for a couple of minutes?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.426
No! You're not keeping
me prisoner in here.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.344
What is this,
like the door in your dressing room?

14:04.428 --> 14:07.055
Oh, God. Fuck you. Fuck you, Alex.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.099
It shut the door, it didn't lock the door.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.768
It was your fucking suggestion
in the first place.

14:11.852 --> 14:15.647
I didn't do that so I'd get
my dick sucked in private.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.026
Will you let me out of here?

14:20.194 --> 14:22.446
Okay. Okay, no. I'm sorry.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.531
I don't give a shit.
Just let me out of here.

14:24.615 --> 14:27.242
Could we please just talk for a second?

14:27.326 --> 14:31.246
You came all the way to Italy to see me.

14:31.330 --> 14:34.374
-You could've just called me.
-You changed your number, dipshit.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.169
You tracked me down
on the other side of the globe.

14:37.252 --> 14:40.005
I think you could have
found my new number.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.760
I get that our relationship
is too damaged,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.846
and I know that we may
never see each other again,

14:49.473 --> 14:53.894
but you are probably the most
important relationship I had.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.562
And I was shitty to you.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.981
And I just wanna talk

14:58.482 --> 15:03.320
and try to arrive at some sort
of understanding between us

15:03.403 --> 15:05.155
so we can go on with our lives.

15:05.989 --> 15:09.243
I don't want to spend the rest
of our lives hating each other.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.455
Could we just talk?

15:18.126 --> 15:19.753
Alex, I was two-faced.

15:20.879 --> 15:23.632
The benefit of hindsight,
that's really the only way to put it.

15:24.716 --> 15:28.387
At the time, I guess I thought that
we were playing some sort of game.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.640
It was like a competition.

15:32.891 --> 15:36.937
I don't know why I couldn't embrace

15:37.020 --> 15:39.231
the idea of us just winning as a team.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.067
I guess I lost track
of what was important.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.238
I can't--

15:46.321 --> 15:48.240
I don't wanna walk
around like this anymore.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.325
My back is killing me--
I have to catch a flight.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.578
-Right now?
-Yeah. I have to get back to work.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.204
What if I hadn't been home?

15:54.288 --> 15:56.707
-You were.
-Well, what if I hadn't been, Alex?

15:56.790 --> 15:57.875
But you're in a lockdown.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.586
Look, all right.
All right, you have to go.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.130
Do you have any response
to what I just said?

16:03.213 --> 16:05.257
What do you want me to say?
How would you like me to respond?

16:05.340 --> 16:06.592
-I don't know.
-That I forgive you?

16:06.675 --> 16:08.510
-'Cause I don't forgive you.
-I'm not asking you to forgive me--

16:08.594 --> 16:09.678
Then what do you want from me?

16:09.761 --> 16:13.724
I want you to understand why I did
some of the fucked-up things that I did.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.392
I'm pretty sure I understand you.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.769
It actually scares me
how much I understand you.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.063
I promise that you don't. Not about this.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.148
And why are you so sure?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.817
Because if you understood, you would know.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.819
Look, none of what I am saying--

16:25.903 --> 16:28.447
I know it doesn't absolve what I did.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.742
I just don't want you to think
that it came from a malicious place.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.912
So you just sort of stumbled
into backstabbing people?

16:34.995 --> 16:36.872
Into fucking people who would have you?

16:36.955 --> 16:38.040
Or wouldn't have you?

16:38.123 --> 16:39.875
I just don't want you
to think that I'm evil.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.213
I have to catch my flight.
As always, it was a pleasure.

16:44.296 --> 16:46.757
Fuck you. God,

16:46.840 --> 16:50.219
were you actually going
to say that I raped you?

16:52.638 --> 16:54.723
Just to confirm,
you'll release that statement?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.517
Yeah, I'll release the goddamn statement.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.851
And just so you know,

16:57.935 --> 17:01.188
I don't think what you did
with me really qualifies as sex.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.984
Press the button three times
to unlock the gate.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.705
Hi, I need a flight to New York.

17:19.790 --> 17:21.458
Okay, madam. When would you like to leave?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.919
Now. I can be there in an hour.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.380
-We don't have anything available.
-Then I'll call someone else.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.339
Everyone from Fashion Week
is trying to leave.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.133
Okay, let me ask you this way.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.301
Is--

17:31.885 --> 17:34.763
Do you have a private jet
leaving from Milan tonight?

17:35.389 --> 17:36.390
We do, but--

17:36.473 --> 17:38.725
Okay. So how much are they paying?

17:38.809 --> 17:41.103
The planes are booked.
I cannot just cancel reservations--

17:41.186 --> 17:44.565
You didn't hear what I was willing to pay.
How much did they pay?

17:44.648 --> 17:47.234
-Madam, I have other calls.
-All right. I'll come down there

17:47.317 --> 17:49.403
and talk to someone
who might give a shit about me.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.405
-That is not a--
-Fuck.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.366
Fuck.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.317
What are you doing?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.277
I want you to watch me delete it.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.697
No, no. It's fine.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.240
Look, look.

18:36.533 --> 18:39.411
I'm going to drag it--

18:43.165 --> 18:46.460
-Empty trash. Gone.
-Okay.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.420
And off I go.

18:49.004 --> 18:53.175
Why? Look, I'm not leaving right away.

18:54.551 --> 18:55.761
Is this because of Alex?

18:56.345 --> 19:00.349
Okay. I'm gonna be better
in a couple of minutes.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.851
-Just stay.
-It's just time for me to go.

19:02.935 --> 19:03.936
What?

19:04.019 --> 19:05.938
It's just time for me to go.
We were quarantining.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.565
I know that you don't
actually want to leave,

19:08.649 --> 19:10.901
so could we just stop with the pretending?

19:11.401 --> 19:13.820
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

19:13.904 --> 19:16.740
It's been a successful crusade.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.327
Okay. No, no. That was her term. Her term.

19:20.410 --> 19:23.205
Yeah, yeah.
Don't get weird about that. That's fine.

19:24.414 --> 19:30.045
By the way, I did get a message
from the professor's daughter.

19:31.088 --> 19:34.842
And he died this morning.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.846
-He died?
-Yeah.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.349
I will send flowers.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.393
I will put your name on them as well.

19:45.102 --> 19:46.728
Yeah, thanks.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.982
-Bye.
-Bye.

20:05.998 --> 20:09.001
Hey, it's Lizzy. I'm not here
right now. Leave a message.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.378
Hi, babe, it's Mom.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.423
Just checking in.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.300
I'm not sure if you've
been trying to call me or not,

20:16.383 --> 20:21.096
but I just want you to know that

20:22.347 --> 20:24.892
there's this book that's coming out

20:25.976 --> 20:28.478
called Wrong Side of the Bed.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.315
It's so fucking stupid.

20:33.108 --> 20:38.447
And in there, there's some
really horrible things about me.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.365
But just because they're in there,

20:40.449 --> 20:43.160
it doesn't mean that they're true, okay?

20:43.952 --> 20:45.370
You just have to know that.

20:48.665 --> 20:52.878
And I just love you so much.

20:53.587 --> 20:54.796
I just love you so much.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.925
You're everything on
this planet Earth to me.

20:58.926 --> 21:00.052
So, just--

21:01.803 --> 21:03.639
I wanted you to know that.

21:03.722 --> 21:06.850
Okay, so, I'll talk to you soon.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.432
Shit!

21:47.516 --> 21:49.935
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.148
Okay. Okay.

22:01.947 --> 22:03.073
Oh, God.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.036
"Turn"--

22:13.625 --> 22:14.877
Okay.

22:23.802 --> 22:25.345
Okay.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.227
Okay.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.337
Oh, my God.

22:59.796 --> 23:00.839
Sorry?

23:02.341 --> 23:03.467
…lockdown.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.136
I'm sorry. I could not hear you.

23:09.223 --> 23:11.099
I can't understand what you're saying.

23:11.183 --> 23:13.435
I said do not roll your window.

23:13.519 --> 23:14.520
I'm so sorry.

23:14.603 --> 23:16.480
No, no. Just leave it down.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.398
Okay. Okay, okay.

23:18.482 --> 23:19.483
Can I see your ID?

23:21.235 --> 23:22.277
Sorry. One second.

23:22.361 --> 23:23.820
Yes, my ID.

23:26.698 --> 23:28.033
How long have you been here?

23:29.076 --> 23:30.244
I got here yesterday.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.079
Do you have a place to stay,

23:32.162 --> 23:33.872
or are you just planning
to sleep in a car?

23:33.956 --> 23:35.374
I was visiting a friend,

23:35.457 --> 23:38.001
and then I was driving
to the airport last night.

23:38.085 --> 23:40.796
And then I got really--
I was falling asleep,

23:40.879 --> 23:43.799
so I just pulled over 'cause

23:43.882 --> 23:45.843
I just wanted to be safe. Safety first.

23:47.177 --> 23:48.679
What time's your flight today?

23:51.390 --> 23:53.934
Yeah. I don't actually
have the flight yet--

23:54.017 --> 23:55.811
Signora, there is a lockdown.

23:55.894 --> 23:58.313
If you let me go now to the airport,

23:59.481 --> 24:01.066
all good, rested and ready to go.

24:01.149 --> 24:05.279
So I will get there, book my flight,
and there-- Grazie mille.

24:08.574 --> 24:10.075
I want to see you make arrangements.

24:12.494 --> 24:13.495
Okay.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.750
My phone is dead.
I did not charge my phone.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.627
I can call someone for you.

24:20.711 --> 24:24.882
I don't have any numbers.
I just don't know any numbers.

24:24.965 --> 24:26.383
I thought you were here to see a friend.

24:32.306 --> 24:33.807
Okay.

24:37.186 --> 24:38.812
What's his name?

24:40.022 --> 24:41.398
Mitch Kessler.

24:44.109 --> 24:46.737
Hello, is this Mr. Mitch Kessler?

24:46.820 --> 24:50.032
This is Officer Bianchi.
Polizia municipale.

24:50.115 --> 24:52.701
Are you friends with a Ms. Alexandra Levy?

25:20.437 --> 25:21.772
Hello?

25:37.746 --> 25:38.830
Hello?

25:58.976 --> 26:02.396
Here's some breakfast
if you are hungry. There's coffee.

26:02.938 --> 26:05.524
Going to stay upstairs
and out of your way.

26:06.024 --> 26:08.277
I really don't wanna talk to you anymore.

26:08.777 --> 26:10.279
It's too hard.

26:10.863 --> 26:13.282
I left the statement
for you in the envelope.

26:26.336 --> 26:27.421
Oh, God.

26:51.069 --> 26:53.572
Oh, God. Fuck.

27:03.081 --> 27:06.502
Jesus, Alex. You didn't have
to fly to Italy to break all of my stuff.

27:23.143 --> 27:25.312
Hey. Hey.

27:26.230 --> 27:27.231
Alex.

27:32.945 --> 27:37.449
I'm trapped in Italy, and I don't know

27:37.533 --> 27:40.327
who I am or what I'm supposed to be doing.

27:45.332 --> 27:47.626
And I just miss you.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.017
That is great.

28:04.101 --> 28:06.562
Thank you for shuffling things
around for us.

28:06.645 --> 28:09.481
She will be there at 6:00 a.m. Perfect.

28:10.065 --> 28:12.067
And to reiterate,

28:12.150 --> 28:14.152
no one can know that
my boss was even in Italy.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.573
That's right. Thank you so much.

28:18.282 --> 28:19.324
They said it couldn't be done.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.660
Anything can happen when you lie.

28:22.244 --> 28:24.955
Well, yeah.
That's true. But this was acting.

28:25.038 --> 28:27.124
Do you feel bad that some
schmuck's getting a phone call

28:27.207 --> 28:29.710
that he has to reschedule
his whole flight plan?

28:29.793 --> 28:32.921
I don't feel badly for anyone
who can afford to fly private.

28:33.005 --> 28:34.131
Except for you.

28:34.214 --> 28:35.424
Goes without saying.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.304
Well, I have until 3:00 a.m.
What are we gonna do?

28:41.305 --> 28:42.556
Let's pretend.

28:43.140 --> 28:46.518
"What ex-president missed the slab of pork

28:46.602 --> 28:50.939
while showing off his ax-wielding skills
to a group of Moscow butchers?"

28:51.023 --> 28:52.107
Nixon.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.609
-What color?
-Green.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.571
What are-- Wait a sec.
Is this the-- Is that right?

28:57.654 --> 29:00.657
"What are Alvin, Simon and Theodore?"

29:01.241 --> 29:02.326
That's easy. Gay.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.411
Hey!

29:04.494 --> 29:06.872
You can't say that shit anymore!

29:06.955 --> 29:08.165
I'm not judging them.

29:08.248 --> 29:11.376
It is a perfectly acceptable lifestyle
for chipmunks these days.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.420
-That's what you were going for.
-Ding-ding-ding!

29:13.504 --> 29:15.923
They're chipmunks. Okay.

29:16.006 --> 29:20.093
Right. Okay. Oh, my God.
You're gonna love this one.

29:20.177 --> 29:22.596
"Who is the Your Day, America anchor

29:23.180 --> 29:26.850
who replaced Blair Todman
after her 12-year run?"

29:26.934 --> 29:29.561
-That's not on there.
-No. It's right there.

29:29.645 --> 29:32.439
Okay. Laura Peterson.
Good God, these are old cards.

29:32.523 --> 29:34.274
She's not that much older than you are.

29:34.358 --> 29:36.944
She's older than me.
She'll always be older than me, forever.

29:37.027 --> 29:39.029
Forever and ever
and ever and ever. I'm bored.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.822
-You're bored?
-I'm very bored.

29:40.906 --> 29:44.910
Yes, you heard me.
Talking about Laura Peterson is boring.

29:44.993 --> 29:48.205
We have been locked
in this place for two weeks,

29:48.288 --> 29:50.082
and I still have not gotten bored.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.543
Two weeks? Just the two of you?

29:55.712 --> 29:57.381
Did your friend leave because of me?

29:57.965 --> 30:00.092
-It wasn't because of you.
-Sure it was.

30:00.175 --> 30:03.971
I mean, a beautiful hunchback
comes walking through your door,

30:04.471 --> 30:08.892
having flown all the way from
the United States of America to see you.

30:09.685 --> 30:11.395
I doubt she thinks that.

30:11.478 --> 30:13.689
I've talked to her about you.

30:14.857 --> 30:17.526
Nothing bad. I told her how great you are,

30:18.235 --> 30:20.153
and how I screwed things up between us.

30:20.237 --> 30:22.030
Well, then it's definitely because of me.

30:22.114 --> 30:25.868
No. I had something
to do with it, I think.

30:25.951 --> 30:27.578
Or maybe it was you.

30:28.161 --> 30:30.539
Maybe she overheard
what you said about her.

30:31.957 --> 30:33.292
Oh, shit.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.211
What did I say? Jesus.

30:37.337 --> 30:38.839
I'm such a jerk.

30:38.922 --> 30:40.716
-No. No.
-I was just--

30:41.216 --> 30:44.553
-Should we invite her back?
-Yeah. Would that be okay?

30:46.930 --> 30:49.016
Yeah. Sure. Whatever you want.

30:49.099 --> 30:50.267
Okay.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.520
I will invite her back.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.107
Actually, could I ask you a favor?

30:58.025 --> 31:01.945
If I gave you her number,
would you give her a call?

31:04.198 --> 31:05.324
Give her a call?

31:05.407 --> 31:07.701
Yeah. I mean,
I can help her out with her work,

31:07.784 --> 31:10.370
but I'm not connected
in the same way that I used to be.

31:10.454 --> 31:12.789
But you are, and I thought
maybe you could help her.

31:12.873 --> 31:14.833
Introduce her a little bit. Not right now.

31:15.584 --> 31:17.211
-You know, somewhere down the line.
-Okay.

31:17.294 --> 31:19.546
Give it some time.
She needs to get her footing.

31:20.047 --> 31:22.674
And I don't want her to feel any pressure.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.512
Sure. Yeah, I can do that.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.138
Great. Thank you.

31:32.059 --> 31:33.101
Wow.

31:35.270 --> 31:38.232
That's so-- I mean--

31:39.399 --> 31:41.944
How long do we think these
have been sitting in this house?

31:42.027 --> 31:44.071
I don't know. They're pretty great.

31:44.154 --> 31:45.739
Some of these are hilarious.

31:46.490 --> 31:47.533
Look at that guy.

31:48.617 --> 31:49.701
Italian stallion.

31:51.787 --> 31:52.955
You're gonna like this.

31:56.041 --> 31:59.795
Oh, no. There he is. I know that guy.

32:01.630 --> 32:03.131
I know that guy.

32:04.758 --> 32:07.719
Please don't hit on me
and ruin this beautiful moment.

32:07.803 --> 32:09.513
I am not trying to hit on you.

32:10.681 --> 32:12.307
I don't want you to like me.

32:12.891 --> 32:16.144
I just don't want you to hate me.
That's all I want.

32:16.228 --> 32:17.229
Oh, no.

32:19.898 --> 32:20.899
God, look at this.

32:20.983 --> 32:23.777
I mean, honestly, so this is
what being canceled looks like.

32:23.861 --> 32:26.280
-Oh, God. That word.
-Is it?

32:26.363 --> 32:28.615
-It's not bad.
-I have not been canceled.

32:29.157 --> 32:32.119
There is only one

32:33.287 --> 32:36.999
entity that could have
the power to do that.

32:37.082 --> 32:39.751
And that is the great
programmer in the sky.

32:40.919 --> 32:43.005
What are you talking about?

32:43.714 --> 32:45.591
But seriously, come on.

32:45.674 --> 32:46.675
I've made some mistakes

32:46.758 --> 32:49.803
-and I just-- I need to know a little--
-Okay.

32:49.887 --> 32:53.599
All right. I think probably
the best part of it,

32:54.224 --> 32:57.895
is that you get to know
what's real in your life.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.148
Who's there and who's not there.

33:02.024 --> 33:04.818
And who believes that you have

33:04.902 --> 33:08.530
the capacity as a human being to change.

33:10.949 --> 33:12.034
Who's that for you?

33:12.618 --> 33:15.704
Well, that's a list of one.
And she doesn't know me very well.

33:16.914 --> 33:20.334
I am so sorry so much bad shit
went down between us.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.252
It doesn't matter.

33:22.753 --> 33:26.423
At our core, you and I,
we know how close we are.

33:31.803 --> 33:32.971
Remember…

33:33.639 --> 33:34.681
Remember Chile?

33:35.724 --> 33:36.725
Of course.

33:37.434 --> 33:40.938
I've never told anybody this,

33:41.021 --> 33:44.525
but for a little period thereafter, I…

33:46.151 --> 33:47.694
I thought I was pregnant.

33:49.655 --> 33:52.699
Jesus, Alex. I'm so sorry.

33:52.783 --> 33:55.369
Oh, no. It wasn't a bad thing.

33:56.578 --> 33:59.373
It wasn't.
It wasn't a bad thing, honestly.

33:59.873 --> 34:05.254
I loved you so much. Not as a lover,
you know, but as a partner.

34:06.421 --> 34:09.382
Two just lost souls, you know…

34:11.592 --> 34:12.803
found each other and…

34:14.847 --> 34:18.976
Until we just blew everything the fuck up.

34:21.562 --> 34:22.938
I really…

34:27.234 --> 34:28.569
And I really--

34:30.487 --> 34:31.697
I really wanted to…

34:32.614 --> 34:33.991
I really wanted to have it.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.492
You know, I just--

34:35.576 --> 34:37.911
I'd stay up at night
just kinda wracking my brain

34:38.786 --> 34:43.333
just trying to see how I could keep it.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.549
But I was just late, you know.

34:53.886 --> 34:56.138
But I grieved it just the same, you know.

36:00.577 --> 36:03.205
-Are you asleep?
-I should be asleep.

36:04.540 --> 36:09.211
I can't. I mean, considering all the
bottles of wine we drank and the jet lag.

36:10.546 --> 36:12.881
I can't get comfortable.

36:12.965 --> 36:15.926
-Is that couch no good?
-No, my back's no good.

36:16.885 --> 36:20.639
Just paying for
my swift dance moves earlier.

36:21.849 --> 36:23.225
How can I help?

36:24.935 --> 36:28.480
It actually might help me
if I lay flat on the hard floor.

36:28.564 --> 36:30.607
-Yeah.
-Do you mind?

36:30.691 --> 36:34.695
-No, no. It might be kinda dirty, so…
-I don't care.

36:34.778 --> 36:35.946
Be my guest.

36:39.783 --> 36:41.034
Paola coming back?

36:41.910 --> 36:43.328
She hasn't responded.

36:44.079 --> 36:45.747
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

36:45.831 --> 36:48.166
Do you mind if I join you
in a prone position?

36:48.250 --> 36:51.545
Not at all. It's a free country.
Wait. We're in Italy.

36:52.296 --> 36:53.839
Well, Italy is a free country.

36:55.382 --> 36:58.385
Outside of
the government lockdowns, it is.

37:01.972 --> 37:03.557
That's so much better.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.933
Yeah.

37:08.937 --> 37:10.522
I'm bitter sometimes.

37:12.316 --> 37:13.984
I can go to some pretty dark places.

37:16.570 --> 37:19.323
I lost everything that I thought
gave my life meaning.

37:20.616 --> 37:22.576
My work life. My sex life.

37:23.368 --> 37:24.661
Your work sex life.

37:25.204 --> 37:27.748
-I'm being serious. Come on.
-I'm sorry. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

37:27.831 --> 37:29.208
-It's okay.
-Sorry.

37:33.003 --> 37:37.758
It just, you know,
makes you appreciate everything.

37:40.844 --> 37:44.932
If you and I had, whatever,

37:45.015 --> 37:49.102
worked at McDonald's together,
we would have had a blast.

37:49.186 --> 37:51.647
Do you know how many
burgers we would have sold?

37:51.730 --> 37:53.023
The most.

37:53.106 --> 37:56.235
Like ever of all burger sales
of all-time records.

37:56.318 --> 37:58.153
Yes. Definitely.

37:58.237 --> 38:01.073
We would be like
the award-winning burger sellers.

38:01.156 --> 38:03.951
Oh, yeah. Burger Team 2000.

38:04.034 --> 38:06.453
That's right. 'Cause we were the best.

38:06.537 --> 38:07.704
We are. We're the best.

38:07.788 --> 38:09.706
-We're the best at everything.
-Everything.

38:10.207 --> 38:11.917
We'd make the best burgers.

38:13.085 --> 38:15.254
-Pretty good.
-Really good.

38:15.838 --> 38:17.005
Do you mind if I…

38:18.173 --> 38:20.050
Oh, yeah. No, I don't mind.

38:21.051 --> 38:23.053
-You got it? You good?
-Yes.

38:23.136 --> 38:24.137
Okay.

39:17.191 --> 39:18.859
…have died from the respiratory virus,

39:18.942 --> 39:22.571
and 27 people are currently
hospitalized in intensive care units.

39:22.654 --> 39:24.907
-Officials in Lombardy have banned…
-Hey.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.534
Hey. You're awake.
I guess I can turn this up.

39:28.911 --> 39:31.580
Oh, God. Can I please have
a sip of your water?

39:31.663 --> 39:32.664
Yeah, sure.

39:32.748 --> 39:35.876
And out of America, a bombshell
from journalist Maggie Brener's

39:35.959 --> 39:40.797
upcoming exposé on the behind-the-scenes
troubles at UBA's The Morning Show,

39:40.881 --> 39:42.424
to be published in Vanity Fair.

39:43.050 --> 39:45.969
Those with knowledge of
the contents of this first excerpt

39:46.053 --> 39:50.432
say it includes allegations that
disgraced former anchor, Mitch Kessler,

39:50.516 --> 39:54.686
targeted an inordinate amount
of his inappropriate sexual advances

39:54.770 --> 39:55.979
toward Black women.

39:56.063 --> 40:00.317
You've got to be fucking
kidding me! Goddamn it!

40:00.400 --> 40:04.655
I guess all the shitty things I did
weren't shitty enough.

40:04.738 --> 40:07.533
'Cause they had to
make up some other shit!

40:08.116 --> 40:09.159
You don't think I did that.

40:09.243 --> 40:11.370
You don't think I targeted
Black women, do you?

40:12.371 --> 40:13.413
I'm attracted to them.

40:13.497 --> 40:16.583
I'm old enough to remember when
that was considered progressive.

40:17.167 --> 40:19.127
The US is requesting the extradition…

40:19.211 --> 40:20.379
I have to go.

40:21.129 --> 40:24.925
Hold on.
You don't have to go for a few hours.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.261
I know, but I just should.

40:27.344 --> 40:30.556
Alex, you don't actually think I did that?

40:32.057 --> 40:37.145
Mitch, just because you didn't mean
to do it doesn't make it okay.

40:37.229 --> 40:39.773
Isn't the fact that I didn't mean
to do it worth something?

40:42.109 --> 40:44.653
I mean, I guess I'm--

40:45.320 --> 40:49.199
I guess I don't have
the tools to understand.

40:51.076 --> 40:54.246
Could you-- Teach me.
Teach me. Could you teach me, Alex?

40:55.455 --> 40:58.125
I wanna be better.
I wanna be a better person.

40:58.208 --> 41:01.461
Please! No, seriously, Alex!

41:02.045 --> 41:05.632
I just-- I want to be a good person.

41:05.716 --> 41:09.511
I know. I know. I can't, honey. I can't.

41:09.595 --> 41:11.972
I just have to go. Okay?

41:15.976 --> 41:20.355
So you come here
and you get me to tell the world

41:20.439 --> 41:22.024
that you are someone you aren't,

41:22.107 --> 41:24.067
so you don't get canceled like I did?

41:24.693 --> 41:29.907
And then you will never tell anyone
who you think I really am?

41:37.623 --> 41:38.916
Never is a long time.

41:39.791 --> 41:42.544
Alex, come on. Just be honest with me.

41:48.842 --> 41:49.843
Okay.

41:53.305 --> 41:54.515
Hey.

41:56.099 --> 41:57.309
I'm sorry.

42:02.231 --> 42:04.608
-Could I have a hug?
-Course.

42:21.208 --> 42:22.543
Will you still--

42:22.626 --> 42:25.087
Yeah. I'll release the statement.

42:26.338 --> 42:28.257
-Okay.
-Will you look after Paola?

42:29.591 --> 42:30.801
Course I will.

43:38.202 --> 43:39.494
It's me.

43:42.247 --> 43:43.498
-Hey.
-Hey.

43:47.419 --> 43:50.964
I just wanna make sure.
Did you see the news?

43:51.048 --> 43:53.425
-Yes, I did.
-And do you…

43:55.260 --> 43:56.845
I don't think I did that.

43:56.929 --> 44:01.350
But I just-- I'm trying…

44:10.651 --> 44:12.945
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

44:14.696 --> 44:16.365
That's how I know it is.

44:18.700 --> 44:19.868
Come.

44:20.536 --> 44:22.246
I can feel that you like it.

44:26.834 --> 44:28.460
No. I can't. I can't.

44:30.045 --> 44:31.046
I'm sorry.

44:31.839 --> 44:33.173
I'm sorry.

44:33.257 --> 44:34.466
Damn it!

44:37.970 --> 44:40.389
Show me your big fucking balls.

44:42.307 --> 44:45.185
What the fuck are you talking-- What?

44:45.769 --> 44:47.396
What?

45:30.814 --> 45:32.107
Oh, no.

45:33.859 --> 45:35.235
I'm out of cigarettes.

45:35.319 --> 45:37.237
-They'll still kill you.
-Yeah.

45:39.281 --> 45:43.827
But, you know, when…
you have the little death…

45:46.371 --> 45:50.542
it just stimulates your appetite
for the big death.

45:54.338 --> 45:56.507
You are such an addict.

45:57.007 --> 46:00.177
-Yes, I am.
-You want me to go get 'em?

46:00.719 --> 46:03.764
-Yes, I do.
-Then get them I shall.

46:12.814 --> 46:14.191
I have something to tell you.

46:14.691 --> 46:15.692
What's up?

46:16.276 --> 46:20.656
I didn't delete the interview.

46:21.698 --> 46:23.033
Because

46:23.116 --> 46:26.745
I thought if I was not
gonna see you ever again…

46:28.539 --> 46:32.209
I could, you know…
I might want to watch it.

46:32.292 --> 46:35.712
Well, if that's the reason,
then you can safely delete it.

46:37.047 --> 46:39.341
-Be right back.
-No. Stay.

46:39.424 --> 46:41.093
-I have to get your cigarettes.
-No. Stay.

46:41.677 --> 46:43.762
-Okay, you're going to get cigarettes?
-I'm on a mission.

46:43.846 --> 46:46.431
-Okay, then go.
-I'm on a mission. I'm on a mission.

47:25.846 --> 47:28.140
Okay. You're okay.

47:29.474 --> 47:32.644
You're a good person.
You're a good person.

47:50.621 --> 47:51.705
Come on. Okay.

48:45.050 --> 48:46.885
Thank God. Thank God.

48:56.728 --> 49:00.023
As long as I am the president
of the UBA news division,

49:00.107 --> 49:03.569
behavior such as that exhibited
by Mitch Kessler will not be tolerated.

49:03.652 --> 49:05.195
Do not show your face tonight.

49:05.279 --> 49:07.739
-I'm divorcing you.
-What you did was wrong!

49:07.823 --> 49:12.327
I didn't use you for a promotion.
You used me.

49:12.411 --> 49:15.038
You need to understand
that what you're trying to do

49:15.122 --> 49:16.832
is breaking my heart.

49:16.915 --> 49:17.916
Rapist!

49:18.000 --> 49:19.877
I didn't coerce you. I didn't trick you.

49:19.960 --> 49:22.171
When Mitch Kessler
decides he's having sex with you,

49:22.254 --> 49:24.298
-you feel pretty fucking power--
-No, no, no, no!

49:24.381 --> 49:26.466
You can't blame me
for things that you regret.

49:26.550 --> 49:29.052
You're a self-indulgent asshole.

49:29.136 --> 49:32.389
You are the people
that I love in the world!

49:32.472 --> 49:34.433
Mitch, this is not okay.
You need to leave.

49:34.516 --> 49:38.896
Your credibility's gone.
You have no allies left.
