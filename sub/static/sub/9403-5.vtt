00:05.000 --> 00:07.251
All right, and I appreciate the way
you've been with my wife and my family,

00:07.252 --> 00:09.236

you need to be gone.

00:13.576 --> 00:15.035

red bedroom records.

could remove the slanderous sign

of your building.

00:19.082 --> 00:20.715

it's not too juvenile?

00:20.716 --> 00:22.709
No. If they're not gonna play
nice, then neither are we.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.671

grab their phone,

00:30.134 --> 00:32.259

to close your eyes to me

05:27.155 --> 05:29.056

at some point in your life,

05:35.998 --> 05:38.499
you repressed something
in order to cope,

05:38.500 --> 05:40.694

is trying to resurface.

05:40.919 --> 05:42.670

And as you know,

11:07.604 --> 11:08.937
Brooke Davis,

11:08.938 --> 11:10.972
opening and maintaining
a successful business

11:10.973 --> 11:12.150
can be very stressful.

11:13.609 --> 11:15.176
What is that?

11:17.280 --> 11:19.397
It's a face-to-face
friend request.

11:19.398 --> 11:20.742
I hope you'll accept.

11:22.117 --> 11:23.036

11:24.687 --> 11:26.688

block feature.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.126
Ugh.

11:39.843 --> 11:42.870

First Alex leaves town.

11:44.307 --> 11:46.768

for Chris Keller?

11:46.769 --> 11:50.312
Well, the thing is,

11:50.313 --> 11:52.774
Tara didn't leave me.

11:52.775 --> 11:54.882
Chase,
you need to face the fact

11:54.883 --> 11:57.152
that your girlfriend's
with Chris Keller now.

11:57.153 --> 12:00.198
Can't really blame her.
Chris Keller <i>is</i> Chris Keller.

12:03.242 --> 12:04.786
You're right.

12:04.787 --> 12:08.790
Unless... are you dating
Chris Keller's girlfriend?

12:08.998 --> 12:11.376
I'm not sure
I'd call it dating.

12:11.377 --> 12:12.901
But you must not have known

12:12.902 --> 12:14.753
it was Chris Keller's
girlfriend, right?

12:17.072 --> 12:20.009
Well, not at first.

12:20.010 --> 12:23.762
Chuck Skolnick has never been
more disappointed in you.

12:34.690 --> 12:36.090
Yeah, come on in!

12:36.091 --> 12:38.426
Hey! Huh?

12:38.427 --> 12:41.680
I <i>really</i> don't have time
for this right now.

12:41.681 --> 12:43.031
- Ugh.
- Whoa.

12:43.032 --> 12:45.066
Chris Keller's insulted
by your lack of enthusiasm.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.234
Listen to me.

12:46.235 --> 12:48.903
Nathan never came home last night.
I have been on the phone all morning.

12:48.904 --> 12:50.488
The airport won't give me
any information.

12:50.489 --> 12:52.624
- Nobody will help me...
- Okay, I'll help you.

12:52.625 --> 12:54.409
I know some people at the airport.
I slept with a stewardess once.

12:54.410 --> 12:55.878
Goodbye, Chris.

12:55.879 --> 12:57.779
Okay, "flight attendant."
Haley!

12:57.780 --> 12:58.965
Come on.

12:58.966 --> 13:00.341
Let me help.
Where you going?

13:00.342 --> 13:02.218
I'm going to the police.

13:02.451 --> 13:04.929
Okay, good.
I slept with a cop once, too.

13:04.930 --> 13:06.421
Let's go!

13:14.096 --> 13:15.398
Hey.

13:15.631 --> 13:18.066
Hey. I just got off the phone
with the sitter.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.350
She said
you're running late.

13:19.351 --> 13:20.485

13:20.486 --> 13:22.070
No, yeah, everything's fine.

13:22.071 --> 13:24.157
I just wanted to spend
some more time with the kids.

13:24.158 --> 13:26.274
Oh. Great.

13:26.275 --> 13:27.525
That's great.

13:27.526 --> 13:29.954

to them, then.

13:29.955 --> 13:32.247
Okay. Bye, babe.
Love you.

13:32.248 --> 13:34.165
I love you, too.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.877
Bye.

13:51.596 --> 13:54.399
You can just say it
if you want.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.117
I'm not following.

13:56.118 --> 13:58.191
You think
I'm a horrible dad.

13:58.774 --> 14:02.440
I have seen horrible dads,
and you are not one of them.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.292
But you are a lucky dad.

14:04.293 --> 14:06.794
You should be counting
your blessings.

14:08.450 --> 14:09.785
Is he okay?

14:09.786 --> 14:11.165
Julian, he's fine.

14:11.166 --> 14:12.371
Nothing's changed.

14:12.584 --> 14:14.290
Davis is still
completely healthy.

14:14.291 --> 14:17.293
But I am a little concerned
about you.

14:17.294 --> 14:18.556
Are you sure he's okay?

14:18.557 --> 14:20.224
Because I read online
that some symptoms

14:20.225 --> 14:21.642
can take a few days
to surface.

14:21.643 --> 14:24.679
If you want
my professional opinion...

14:24.680 --> 14:28.766
You should get this filled
immediately.

14:30.402 --> 14:34.956
That's one day of rest
and relaxation for you.

14:39.189 --> 14:41.779
Jamie, come play "Marco polo"
with us.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.481

14:47.036 --> 14:48.032
Fine.

little man?

14:50.589 --> 14:51.661
Clay.

14:51.662 --> 14:53.257
You know, aunt Quinn,

14:53.258 --> 14:55.248
it's not <i>his</i> fault
when he wanders.

14:55.249 --> 14:57.458
I know.

14:57.459 --> 14:58.796
Here.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.715
You should keep
my silver dollar on you

15:00.716 --> 15:02.088
till Clay gets better.

15:02.089 --> 15:03.301
Thanks.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.049
Is it for good luck?

15:05.050 --> 15:06.804
More your luck than his.

15:08.218 --> 15:11.055
It's silver.
Just trust me on this one.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.848
Jamie,
Clay is <i>not</i> a werewolf.

15:13.112 --> 15:14.141
But there's supposed to be
a full moon tonight.

15:14.142 --> 15:15.560
Jamie...
you don't have to be afraid.

15:15.561 --> 15:16.978
Not all werewolves are bad.

Professor Lupin, one of
Harry Potter's best teachers.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.738
Okay, if I promise
to keep it on me,

15:23.739 --> 15:25.623
will you come play "Marco polo"
with us?

15:25.624 --> 15:26.988
Deal.
But you're Marco.

15:26.989 --> 15:28.239
Come on.

15:30.282 --> 15:32.130
So, you just grind
the beans,

15:32.131 --> 15:33.869
then pack them
in the portafilter.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.330
- Look at that perfect crema.
- Crema?

15:36.552 --> 15:38.457
The lighter-colored
top layer.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.037
- It's the mark of a great espresso.
- Oh.

15:40.038 --> 15:41.794
Then,
you aerate the milk

15:42.040 --> 15:43.254
until you get the consistency
you want.

15:43.255 --> 15:45.810
I'm sorry. What language
are you speaking,

15:45.811 --> 15:47.383
and how do you know
how to do this?

15:47.646 --> 15:49.730
We did a segment on "mouth
and Millie in the morning."

15:49.731 --> 15:52.233
- You said you watch.
- I <i>do.</i>

15:52.234 --> 15:53.551
But I'm the mother
of twins,

15:53.552 --> 15:55.099
and sometimes they put on
their own morning show.

15:56.725 --> 15:58.790
I did catch a clip
on YouTube recently.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.358
Let me guess...

16:00.359 --> 16:02.523
the one where I call Marvin fat
on live television.

16:02.524 --> 16:07.236
I think it was more like,
"fat. Fat, fat, fat, fat."

16:09.751 --> 16:11.115
That's a bold move,
Millie.

16:11.116 --> 16:13.868
It was a mean move,
and I wish I could take it back.

16:14.072 --> 16:17.121
But at least
he's eating healthier now.

16:17.122 --> 16:18.539

- Who does that?
- That's what I said!

16:36.278 --> 16:38.601
- She's such a little...
- Cockroach!

16:38.864 --> 16:40.311

20:52.868 --> 20:55.107
Oh, okay, so...
You don't even know me.

20:55.108 --> 20:56.987
...hey, no, now we're making
generalizations.

20:56.988 --> 20:58.489
So, you're the jackass
in high school

20:58.490 --> 21:00.040
who now gets to harass people
and carry a gun.

21:02.878 --> 21:04.578
Give us a minute.

21:04.824 --> 21:07.214
Okay.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.920
All right, look, buddy.
I know this woman.

21:12.921 --> 21:15.172
She wouldn't be here
if there wasn't a problem.

21:15.173 --> 21:17.141
Nathan Scott's
a good guy...

21:17.142 --> 21:19.543
a great father,
a responsible husband.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.845
Come on, man.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.797
Even if he wasn't,
would you leave <i>her?</i>

21:24.010 --> 21:25.804
Something's wrong here,
I promise.

21:26.017 --> 21:29.553
Now, she just needs someone
to make her feel better,

21:29.554 --> 21:33.491
make her feel like
everything's gonna be okay.

21:35.059 --> 21:35.940
Mrs. Scott?

21:35.941 --> 21:39.193
I'll do what I can do,
okay?

21:51.767 --> 21:53.768
Whatcha looking at?

21:53.769 --> 21:55.703
Lost my plane
on the roof.

21:55.704 --> 21:57.489
Ohh, that sucks.

21:59.045 --> 22:00.464
What kind of plane is it?

22:00.465 --> 22:02.577
You wouldn't know.

22:02.578 --> 22:04.551
An edf jet.

22:04.552 --> 22:05.947
Yeah, you're right.

22:05.948 --> 22:08.466
I mean, what would I know
about a plane

22:08.467 --> 22:10.474
that flies
on an electric ducted fan

22:10.475 --> 22:12.893
or know about maneuvers

22:12.894 --> 22:15.790
like cobras
or dizzying flat spins?

22:17.272 --> 22:18.941
I used to build model planes
with my dad.

22:18.942 --> 22:20.526
You can do a cobra?

22:20.729 --> 22:22.063
Maybe.
I don't know.

22:22.064 --> 22:23.946
My planes never left
the ground.

22:23.947 --> 22:25.948
What?
Flying's the best part!

22:25.949 --> 22:28.409
Yeah, I just
didn't want to crash.

22:28.637 --> 22:31.072
Crashing's
the second best part.

22:32.454 --> 22:33.664
Do you still make them?

22:33.665 --> 22:36.542
Uh, no.
Not since my dad passed away.

22:36.745 --> 22:39.003
Is that why
you're staying here?

22:39.004 --> 22:41.950
No, I'm actually
<i>not</i> staying.

22:41.951 --> 22:43.716
I'm leaving tonight.

22:43.953 --> 22:47.636
I can't believe
you never tried to fly.

22:52.182 --> 22:54.101
Cannibal!

22:54.102 --> 22:57.382
Did you say "cannibal"?

22:57.383 --> 22:58.355
Yeah.

22:58.584 --> 23:00.941
It's "cannonball,"
not "cannibal."

23:00.942 --> 23:03.569
Fine.
Cannonball!

26:29.901 --> 26:31.610
Okay.

Well, I can tell you the flight
did arrive in Tree Hill

No. Thanks.

26:51.834 --> 26:54.049
Look, I'm sure
everything is just fine.

26:54.050 --> 26:55.920
You know, I bet he just...
he missed his flight.

27:14.556 --> 27:16.321

27:16.322 --> 27:18.407
Thank you so much.

27:19.545 --> 27:21.535

28:06.867 --> 28:09.369

28:09.370 --> 28:11.376

28:19.677 --> 28:21.803

28:21.804 --> 28:23.138

28:23.139 --> 28:25.349

28:25.350 --> 28:28.037
Is he... is he here yet?

28:28.038 --> 28:29.519
No, not yet.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.257
Must be running late.

28:31.258 --> 28:32.731

have you heard from Nathan?

29:41.078 --> 29:42.378
No, why?

29:42.379 --> 29:45.512
Oh, he, uh, he didn't make it
home last night.

29:45.513 --> 29:48.418
Well, I'm sure he's fine.
He always changes flights.

29:48.419 --> 29:50.892
He's probably just in the air
and can't call.

29:50.893 --> 29:52.555
So, what can I do
for you?

29:52.556 --> 29:54.980
Want me to bring you
some more stuff from home?

29:54.981 --> 29:58.094
You know, honestly,
I'm thinking about leaving.

29:58.095 --> 30:00.313
I'm just not sure
that Dr. Alvarez

30:00.314 --> 30:02.028
is the right doctor
for me.

30:02.029 --> 30:04.067
Why? What happened?

30:04.068 --> 30:08.660
He thinks that I'm hiding
some big secret from myself

30:08.661 --> 30:10.857
and that's what's
making me wander.

30:10.858 --> 30:13.165
He diagnosed me
with a fugue disorder.

30:13.166 --> 30:16.209
Can it be treated?

30:16.210 --> 30:18.915
Yeah, I guess
most people stop wandering

30:18.916 --> 30:21.965
once they've come to terms
with whatever triggered it.

30:21.966 --> 30:24.487
I mean, if you have a diagnosis
and a possible cure,

30:24.488 --> 30:25.760
why would you
want to leave?

30:25.761 --> 30:27.757
I

30:27.758 --> 30:30.093
What could possibly
be bad enough

30:30.094 --> 30:31.892
to make my brain
shut down?

30:31.893 --> 30:34.213
I guess I'm just afraid

30:34.214 --> 30:38.000
of what that missing information
might be.

30:38.001 --> 30:40.567
And I'm afraid of burdening you
with more of my struggle.

30:40.568 --> 30:43.778
It's because you're afraid
that you need to stay.

30:43.779 --> 30:46.392
You should probably have them
reinforce the windows

30:46.393 --> 30:47.616

Can I help you
with something?

33:04.754 --> 33:07.756
I thought you said you lost
everything in the fire.

33:14.943 --> 33:16.181
Hey.

33:16.182 --> 33:17.891
Thought you were leaving.

33:17.892 --> 33:19.768
Nah, it looks like
I'll be staying a while.

33:21.143 --> 33:22.769
I got you something.

33:24.688 --> 33:25.774
You got it!

33:27.817 --> 33:29.142
Thanks.

33:29.143 --> 33:30.193
Yeah.

33:33.030 --> 33:34.157
I'm Clay.

33:34.158 --> 33:35.825
Logan.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.183
Like Wolverine.

33:37.184 --> 33:39.412
He's my favorite superhero
of all time.

33:39.413 --> 33:40.872
Who?

33:40.873 --> 33:42.989
You don't know Wolverine?

33:42.990 --> 33:44.941
Come on, dude.
He's <i>awesome.</i>

33:51.590 --> 33:53.802
All right,
well, I got to get going,

33:54.034 --> 33:57.370
but, um, maybe tomorrow,
we can fly that thing?

33:59.348 --> 34:01.685
You're not afraid anymore?

34:01.686 --> 34:04.544
No, I'm still
a little bit afraid,

34:04.545 --> 34:06.147
but I'm working on it.

34:18.033 --> 34:18.952
- Boom!

34:18.953 --> 34:20.393
There it is!

34:20.393 --> 34:21.610
All right, now let me
show you how to play.

34:21.612 --> 34:23.998
Probably easiest
if you sit on my lap.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.949
You see what it's like
to be old Chris Keller

34:25.949 --> 34:27.918
in his element.
Mm.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.337
Is this the work
that made you bail on Chuck?

34:29.338 --> 34:30.737
Look, sorry, man.

34:30.737 --> 34:32.672
I had to take care
of Chris Keller tonight.

34:32.672 --> 34:34.373
Besides,
he's hanging with his dad.

34:34.375 --> 34:36.009
He doesn't need
a babysitter.

34:36.010 --> 34:38.261
You musicians are all the same.
You know that?

34:38.262 --> 34:41.130
You just bulldoze through town,
making empty promises,

34:41.132 --> 34:43.350
and you don't care who you hurt
along the way.

34:43.351 --> 34:45.061
Dude, hey,
lighten up, man.

34:45.062 --> 34:46.855
Why don't you call, uh,
"not Alex."

34:47.103 --> 34:50.690
I already talked to her.
She's coming over tonight.

34:54.777 --> 34:56.478
So, here's some popcorn.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.431
We'll watch a scary movie,

34:58.432 --> 35:01.119
and it'll be Lydia's
first sleepover.

35:01.369 --> 35:03.403
And in the morning,
dad will be home.

35:03.404 --> 35:05.772
We should call your mom
and say goodnight first.

35:11.245 --> 35:12.429
<i>Hey, it's Haley.</i>

35:12.430 --> 35:13.630
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

35:13.631 --> 35:15.715
Hey, hales.
Jamie's just going to sleep.

35:15.716 --> 35:17.177
He just wanted
to say good night.

35:17.178 --> 35:19.118
Hi, mom.

35:19.119 --> 35:21.304
Thanks for letting me stay
at aunt Quinn's tonight.

35:21.305 --> 35:22.472
We had so much fun
that...

35:24.475 --> 35:25.892
...I'm gonna fall
right to sleep.

35:25.893 --> 35:27.103
Love you!

35:27.104 --> 35:31.297
Hey, hales, um...

35:31.298 --> 35:33.401
...so I talked to Clay,
but, uh...

35:33.634 --> 35:38.104
He hasn't heard from Nathan,
so... Call me back.

35:38.105 --> 35:41.408
I'm, uh,
I'm worried about you.

35:44.245 --> 35:47.707
The fake yawn
was a <i>bit</i> much.

35:47.708 --> 35:51.086
You think?

37:00.070 --> 37:02.889
- What, you got a problem?
- Huh?

37:06.285 --> 37:08.705
Yeah, I do.

37:18.322 --> 37:21.092
Hi. I need to speak
with the owner, please.

37:21.093 --> 37:22.969
Sorry,
Tara's out for the night.

37:22.970 --> 37:25.013
Could you give her
a message for me?

37:25.014 --> 37:27.313
Sure.
Great.

38:00.531 --> 38:02.050
Is that all you got?

38:04.051 --> 38:04.802
Ohh!

38:04.803 --> 38:06.054
Ohh! That's more like it.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.991
Well?
Answer the question, Dan.

38:11.992 --> 38:14.193
You said you lost everything
in the fire,

38:14.194 --> 38:15.528
so why do you have this?

38:15.529 --> 38:18.030
And all that money...
why do you have that?

38:18.031 --> 38:20.717
Was it <i>not</i> an accident?
Did you start the fire yourself?

38:22.861 --> 38:24.671
Oh, my God.
You did!

38:24.672 --> 38:26.673
You started the fire!

38:26.674 --> 38:28.391
I trusted you.
I let you into my home.

38:28.392 --> 38:30.209
I defended you,
and you lied to me,

38:30.210 --> 38:31.594
and you took advantage
of me!

38:31.595 --> 38:33.713
And the doors...
the doors here and at the café.

38:33.714 --> 38:34.666
Was that you, too?

38:34.667 --> 38:36.417
Haley,
will you let me explain?

38:36.418 --> 38:38.485
What else
are you lying about, Dan?

38:38.486 --> 38:40.797
Where is Nathan?
What did you do to him?

38:40.798 --> 38:42.423
What?
Nathan's missing?

38:42.424 --> 38:43.606
Don't play games with me.

38:43.607 --> 38:44.991
You knew
the second he got home

38:44.992 --> 38:46.442
that you were gonna
have to leave,

38:46.443 --> 38:48.111
so you made sure
that he never got home!

38:48.112 --> 38:49.806
Haley, what are you...
where is my husband?!

38:49.807 --> 38:51.364
Where is Nathan?!
Haley, will you calm down?!

38:51.365 --> 38:52.749
Please, let me explain!

38:52.750 --> 38:54.560
Please, just let me
explain, okay?

38:54.561 --> 38:55.835
You're right.

38:55.836 --> 38:58.755
Nathan gave me the baseball
and the picture,

38:58.756 --> 39:00.066
and I sensed a thaw.

39:04.027 --> 39:06.496
At least an opportunity
for one.

39:06.497 --> 39:07.532
I had to act.

39:10.351 --> 39:12.135
I tried to get close
to Jamie and Lydia

39:12.136 --> 39:13.469
while Nathan
was still vulnerable.

39:15.414 --> 39:18.308
But I didn't know anything about
Nathan missing until just now.

39:18.309 --> 39:19.711
I promise.

39:19.712 --> 39:22.005
I was just a desperate man

39:22.006 --> 39:24.397
trying to get close
to my family.

39:24.398 --> 39:25.982
Please.

39:27.568 --> 39:29.637
You understand,
don't you?

39:29.638 --> 39:32.488
I'm sorry.

39:32.489 --> 39:34.642
I do understand.

39:34.643 --> 39:36.477
I'm out of my mind
right now.

39:36.944 --> 39:40.163
Of course you didn't do anything
to your son.

39:40.164 --> 39:42.165
I'm just so worried
about him.

39:43.650 --> 39:45.903
You need to relax.

39:45.904 --> 39:48.406
If Nathan didn't come home,

39:48.407 --> 39:51.951
there's a perfectly good
explanation for it.

39:51.952 --> 39:54.093
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

39:54.094 --> 39:56.896
I mean, he probably...
he probably missed his flight.

39:56.897 --> 39:59.098
Yeah.
Right?

40:01.710 --> 40:04.070
I... I'm so silly.

40:04.071 --> 40:07.633
I need... I need to calm down
and get some sleep.

40:07.634 --> 40:10.660
That's a really good idea.

40:11.683 --> 40:13.056
Okay.

40:41.542 --> 40:44.310
911. What's your emergency?

40:44.311 --> 40:47.632
I need your help.
There's a murderer in my house.
