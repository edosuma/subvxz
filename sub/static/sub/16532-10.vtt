WEBVTT

00:01.510 --> 00:02.660
Hey, Jay.

00:02.680 --> 00:03.460
- Oh!
- Welcome!

00:03.660 --> 00:05.360
New Year's Day at Jay's.

00:05.390 --> 00:07.070
My dad was driving in.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.160
Things were looking
up after a bad morning.

00:10.430 --> 00:13.650
- Oh! Yeah!
- Oh, man!

00:13.670 --> 00:16.219
Look how high it goes!

00:16.239 --> 00:18.400
I'm gonna try and spit on a bird.

00:20.010 --> 00:21.850
Did he just get off the ride?

00:23.880 --> 00:26.950
You know, honey, um,
I'm getting cold feet.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.560
- Maybe we should just...
- Well, if you're scared,

00:28.580 --> 00:29.700
we should just go.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.450
I'm disappointed, 'cause to
me, it seemed like a blast.

00:32.470 --> 00:34.230
Oh!

00:34.250 --> 00:36.210
My resolution to live more dangerously

00:36.240 --> 00:38.050
was off to a rocky start.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.910
Help yourself to my Christmas present.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.760
Nothing like a frozen
margarita in a hot tub.

00:42.780 --> 00:45.410
Lets nature know we
can do anything she can.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.840
Well, I'll take one to go.

00:46.850 --> 00:48.930
Alex and I are just here
to raid your guys' closet

00:48.950 --> 00:50.200
for some vintage clothing.

00:50.220 --> 00:52.800
Yeah, we're going to a '90s music
festival called Fo-shizzle-fest.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.820
Okay, get ready to pig out!

00:55.840 --> 00:57.740
In six to eight hours.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.510
I did Thanksgiving dinner last year,

00:59.530 --> 01:00.910
and it didn't go well.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.400
Cam blew up the turkey

01:02.420 --> 01:03.690
and made the goat kill itself.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.510
Anyhoo, today is my comeback meal,

01:05.540 --> 01:07.830
and I decided to keep it
simple and roast a pig.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.410
So, you just dig a hole,

01:09.440 --> 01:12.020
you put down a bed of coals,
then a layer of banana leaves,

01:12.050 --> 01:14.430
lower the pig, cover it
with burlap and tin foil,

01:14.450 --> 01:15.710
and... bam!

01:15.730 --> 01:17.560
Six hours later, you dig it all up,

01:17.580 --> 01:19.470
put it on a platter, and... bam!

01:19.490 --> 01:20.890
Dinner is served.

01:20.910 --> 01:22.140
Guys,

01:22.170 --> 01:24.900
just because you spent
Christmas in Missouri

01:24.920 --> 01:26.450
doesn't mean that we forgot about you.

01:26.470 --> 01:29.230
- Open your presents.
- Oh, okay! I'll go first.

01:29.260 --> 01:31.700
Uh, let's see.

01:31.730 --> 01:34.140
Oh, it's a gift
certificate for E-Butler.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.840
It's a concierge service.

01:35.860 --> 01:38.180
Use it for errands,
tickets, things like that.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.160
Oh my God. I love this!

01:39.190 --> 01:40.330
It's like staying in a hotel,

01:40.350 --> 01:42.220
but I don't have to wear
gloves to use the remote.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.010
Okay, me next. Me next.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.440
Oh...

01:45.720 --> 01:48.020
it's an apron with... with bells on it.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.390
And it says, "Cam and get it!"

01:50.410 --> 01:51.820
Oh, so that's not a mistake?

01:51.850 --> 01:54.220
We spent extra cash to
get that custom made.

01:54.250 --> 01:55.280
Came to me in a dream.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.330
Put it on, buddy.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.900
Let's, uh... let's get pictures
with you guys and your gifts.

01:58.930 --> 02:00.530
Jay and Gloria, get in there too.

02:00.930 --> 02:02.360
Come on, honey. Let's go.

02:02.650 --> 02:03.980
- Oh, boy.
- I'll tie it.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.330
- No, you won't.
- All right.

02:08.190 --> 02:09.610
- Whoa!
- Oh!

02:11.340 --> 02:13.820
I told you Stella was trying to kill me!

02:28.340 --> 02:30.350
- Well, that was a scare.
- Nothing happened.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.790
I know where you're going with this.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.360
This is why I've been hounding you

02:33.380 --> 02:34.460
about your estate planning.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.420
No, Mitch. Don't put that
horrible thing out in the universe!

02:40.660 --> 02:41.970
Dad, you still haven't done that?

02:41.990 --> 02:44.210
They haven't updated their
paperwork since Joe was born.

02:44.230 --> 02:47.090
Uh, God forbid something
bad should happen to them...

02:47.120 --> 02:48.770
we don't even know who'd
they want to raise Joe.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.260
Shh!

02:51.460 --> 02:53.340
Will you stop scaring her?

02:53.370 --> 02:55.170
I spend more money on eyelashes

02:55.200 --> 02:56.680
than most of you do on health care.

02:56.700 --> 02:57.810
Fine, we'll do it today.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.450
What better way to start the new year

02:59.470 --> 03:01.150
than by preparing for the worst?

03:01.170 --> 03:03.270
Speaking of alive dads,

03:03.300 --> 03:05.450
- there's mine!
- Oh!

03:05.480 --> 03:06.860
- So good to see you!
- Oh!

03:06.880 --> 03:08.060
How was the drive?

03:08.090 --> 03:09.200
Fantastic.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.550
- My radio broke around Tallahassee.
- Aw.

03:11.580 --> 03:13.580
But is there a better
entertainment source

03:13.600 --> 03:15.360
than the billboards of America?

03:15.390 --> 03:17.700
Apparently, syphilis
is making a comeback.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.480
Plus, you had me to keep you company.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.540
Lorraine?

03:22.860 --> 03:24.860
Lorraine was my babysitter growing up.

03:24.890 --> 03:26.440
She was also my first crush

03:26.460 --> 03:30.390
and also the star of my first, um...

03:31.120 --> 03:32.480
"funny dream."

03:32.500 --> 03:34.420
Yeah, Lorraine used to bring out

03:34.440 --> 03:36.580
- the holy terror in Phil.
- Oh.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.370
It seemed like he wanted
to be spanked by her.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.800
No, I did not.

03:39.830 --> 03:42.220
How long has this been going on?

03:42.240 --> 03:45.070
Well, we reconnected earlier
this year on jury duty.

03:45.090 --> 03:46.200
I was the lone holdout

03:46.220 --> 03:48.270
- on a triple homicide case.
- Mm.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.480
You can just feel

03:49.500 --> 03:51.690
- when someone is innocent, you know?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.880
But Lorraine said she'd go out to
lunch with me if I changed my vote,

03:54.910 --> 03:56.460
so here we are.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.670
- Phil, did... did you ever dream...
- No.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.610
Last time I saw you,
you came up to here.

04:01.630 --> 04:03.940
Okay, Claire will take you
that way to the back yard.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.670
I'll go through the house so we
can finally know which way's faster.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.900
Okay, just a few simple questions,

04:08.920 --> 04:10.680
and your estate planning is done.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.940
What is this?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.950
We don't need to put aside
money for Manny's college.

04:13.980 --> 04:15.600
I already took care of it.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.269
When Manny was born, I
didn't want to rely on anyone,

04:18.290 --> 04:20.450
so I started saving
money from my paycheck.

04:20.470 --> 04:22.590
Eventually, I made enough
money for Manny's college,

04:22.610 --> 04:24.700
so if anything happens, he'll be okay.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.060
That's amazing.

04:26.090 --> 04:28.190
How did I not see this
in the bank statements?

04:28.210 --> 04:29.980
Why would I put money that I might need

04:30.000 --> 04:31.800
to run away with in the middle of night

04:31.820 --> 04:33.060
in the bank?

04:33.280 --> 04:34.780
I put it in my disappear bag.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.000
It's hard not to take
that personally, but, um,

04:37.030 --> 04:38.190
where is this bag?

04:38.220 --> 04:40.950
It's in... in...

04:40.980 --> 04:42.520
- You forgot?
- No.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.770
That's why I made a song

04:43.800 --> 04:46.200
so that it would
always help me remember.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.930
♪ My disappear bag, my disappear bag ♪

04:49.960 --> 04:52.660
♪ I hid you very safely in the ♪

04:53.020 --> 04:54.880
I don't know.

04:55.530 --> 04:56.830
One second.

04:56.850 --> 04:58.730
Okay, Cam, what are we...

04:58.760 --> 05:00.470
Okay. Just... just
be cool. Just be cool.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.510
Be cool? You just jangled across the
yard like a big country tambourine.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.850
All right, well, apparently, the
fire went out and I didn't notice,

05:05.880 --> 05:08.300
and now this pig is as cold
as your family is gonna be

05:08.320 --> 05:10.040
when they figure out
I ruined another meal.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.090
Okay, this is bad.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.120
My dad does not like to be pork teased.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.050
Well, maybe we can
get a replacement pig.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.970
Do you think your concierge
thing could help out?

05:16.990 --> 05:18.250
But I just got it today,

05:18.270 --> 05:20.270
and... and the card
says, "For Mitch stuff."

05:20.290 --> 05:21.570
Mitchell, one of my resolutions

05:21.590 --> 05:23.160
was to cry less outside the home.

05:23.180 --> 05:25.170
- Please help me get through this day.
- Gosh.

05:25.390 --> 05:27.520
You know they only got
me six hours, right?

05:27.540 --> 05:28.700
I know. Thank you.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.640
Okay.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.300
Thank you for calling
E-Butler, Mr. Pritchett.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.300
How may I make your day more E-fficient?

05:33.320 --> 05:35.450
Okay, um, well, this is a weird request.

05:35.470 --> 05:39.570
Keep in mind, erotic tasks are
billed at twice the normal rate.

05:39.870 --> 05:43.610
Uh, no, I-I need you to secretly
deliver a whole roasted pig.

05:43.630 --> 05:45.100
With extreme pleasure.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.860
Requests like these
remind me why I E-buttle.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.110
I knew that voice.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.170
It was Keifth.

05:50.420 --> 05:51.660
When I first moved here,

05:51.690 --> 05:53.440
I was just a young Missouri hayseed.

05:53.460 --> 05:55.420
I-I bought a ticket
to the circus one day,

05:55.440 --> 05:57.590
and there in the middle
of all the action,

05:57.940 --> 06:01.490
in an impeccably pressed
tuxedo, was Ringmaster Keifth.

06:01.510 --> 06:04.320
I started hanging out at
circus bars until we met.

06:04.340 --> 06:05.900
The attraction was immediate.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.350
He was older, always
in command of a room,

06:08.370 --> 06:11.240
which makes sense because a
room is just a permanent tent.

06:11.730 --> 06:13.080
We dated for six months.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.390
He transformed me

06:14.410 --> 06:16.810
into the sophisticate
that we all know today.

06:17.700 --> 06:21.170
And then, he suddenly disappeared.

06:21.590 --> 06:24.130
No goodbye. No note.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.930
Just some peanut shells on
the floor that must have...

06:26.950 --> 06:29.220
fallen from his glorious black boot.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.780
I found a trattoria in Little Polynesia

06:31.800 --> 06:33.990
- that can spare a fully roasted pig.
- Mitchell.

06:34.010 --> 06:35.110
Sorry for the delay.

06:35.140 --> 06:36.440
It w... it was a minute and a half.

06:36.460 --> 06:37.420
You can't know my shame.

06:37.450 --> 06:39.620
I'll deliver the porcine
parcel within the hour.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.160
Okay, that... that is great.
I will... I will see you then.

06:42.190 --> 06:43.250
What is wrong with you?

06:43.280 --> 06:44.320
Okay, my circus boyfriend

06:44.350 --> 06:45.290
who left me in the
middle of the night...

06:45.320 --> 06:46.350
that was him.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.150
And now he's coming here?!

06:48.170 --> 06:50.200
This is no way to ring in a new year.

06:57.390 --> 06:58.720
The money has to be here somewhere.

06:58.750 --> 07:02.280
This is all the stuff from
when we first moved in together.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.570
Why do we have a box of doll heads?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.340
Oh, I guess you think it's a coincidence

07:06.370 --> 07:08.990
that we have never had
evil spirits in this house.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.370
What about these will questions?

07:10.390 --> 07:12.990
If something happens to
us, who should raise Joe?

07:13.020 --> 07:14.420
No, Jay, don't say that.

07:14.440 --> 07:15.770
All right, look.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.790
If someone other than
us needs to raise Joe,

07:19.810 --> 07:21.150
I vote Mitch and Cam.

07:21.180 --> 07:22.610
Nice balance.

07:22.630 --> 07:25.230
Mitch is, uh, responsible,
he knows culture,

07:25.260 --> 07:28.500
and Cam is basically a mom
who played college football.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.130
Plus, Joe and Lily are close in age.

07:32.150 --> 07:34.080
Yeah, but isn't she a little...

07:34.110 --> 07:35.840
Direct? You're not wrong.

07:35.860 --> 07:38.180
She did five minutes on
my nose at Thanksgiving.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.600
I mean, it's a little big,

07:39.930 --> 07:42.190
but to say that it has its own zip code,

07:42.210 --> 07:43.640
that was too much for me.

07:43.890 --> 07:45.970
- What's this?
- No, that is...

07:46.650 --> 07:48.830
"If I ever go missing or am found dead,

07:48.860 --> 07:50.540
"it was my husband"?

07:50.560 --> 07:51.700
What the hell is this?!

07:51.720 --> 07:53.020
Ay! Calm down.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.110
It was when we had our first big fight.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.740
Of course I knew that you
were not going to kill me.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.540
I was just going to
run away and frame you.

08:01.870 --> 08:05.600
Is it weird we've barely seen
Phil since we've been here?

08:05.630 --> 08:06.800
He was always a wanderer.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.770
It's the curse of being a genius.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.730
Oh.

08:14.970 --> 08:17.060
- Phil.
- Trinidad and Tobago!

08:17.090 --> 08:18.220
Why are you avoiding Frank?

08:18.240 --> 08:19.650
What?

08:19.670 --> 08:20.860
I'm...

08:22.060 --> 08:23.690
Okay, there's something you don't know.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.950
She used to be your babysitter,
and you had the hots for her.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.240
How?

08:27.260 --> 08:28.530
What is the plan, honey?

08:28.550 --> 08:29.890
Are you just gonna avoid them?

08:29.920 --> 08:32.360
I just need a minute to get
comfortable with this, okay?

08:32.380 --> 08:35.110
I mean, did he always
have a crush on her,

08:35.130 --> 08:36.980
even when my mom was around?

08:37.809 --> 08:39.679
It's one thing for a 13-year-old

08:39.700 --> 08:42.030
to position his babysitter in
front of an open refrigerator

08:42.059 --> 08:44.730
so that he can enjoy the backlit
contours of her beautiful body

08:44.750 --> 08:46.530
in the silk blouse he
stole from Randall's mother.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.450
But if he was doing the same thing?

08:49.890 --> 08:51.260
Uh, moving past your decision

08:51.290 --> 08:53.820
to steal trophy clothing
from Randall's mom,

08:53.850 --> 08:55.680
maybe you could just talk to your dad.

08:56.790 --> 08:58.680
You know we don't talk in my family.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.710
We riff. We do bits.

09:00.730 --> 09:02.520
You know how my dad told
me my grandmother died?

09:02.540 --> 09:03.790
In a knock-knock joke.

09:03.820 --> 09:06.200
That is last year's Phil talking.

09:06.220 --> 09:08.990
In the spirit of
living more dangerously,

09:09.010 --> 09:10.560
why don't you take an emotional risk

09:10.590 --> 09:13.840
and... and try and have an honest
conversation with your father?

09:14.140 --> 09:17.690
Also, well, I may not be wearing...

09:17.720 --> 09:19.900
Randall's mothers blouse,

09:19.920 --> 09:21.950
but I thought maybe you'd like...

09:22.790 --> 09:24.090
And he's gone.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.980
Uh, da... how am I saying it wrong?

09:25.990 --> 09:28.140
- His name is Keith.
- No.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.260
Keef?

09:29.280 --> 09:30.950
It couldn't be simpler.

09:30.980 --> 09:34.010
K-E-I-F-T-H. Keifth.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.010
Fth. Fth.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.090
A remarkable name for a remarkable man.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.720
Isn't ringmaster basically
a ceremonial position?

09:40.910 --> 09:41.920
Uh, wow.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.330
I would love to live
in your fantasy world

09:43.350 --> 09:44.800
where circuses run themselves.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.560
Okay. Call and cancel.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.980
Then who's gonna save your dinner?

09:48.010 --> 09:51.200
Besides, we don't even know if
the concierge is actually Keifth.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.260
I'm gonna forget the velvety baritone

09:53.280 --> 09:55.300
that abandoned me in
the middle of the night?

09:55.330 --> 09:56.880
And plus, he walks in here, I lose it,

09:56.900 --> 09:58.380
I don't want Lily to see that.

09:58.590 --> 09:59.610
Oh, she's not here.

09:59.630 --> 10:01.650
She has that sleepover,
and she already leffffth.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.170
Without saying goodbye?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.230
Then it hit me.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.660
It could be therapeutic for Cam

10:05.680 --> 10:09.190
to see this ridiculously named
circus person who deserted him

10:09.210 --> 10:11.790
because that incident
could be the very root

10:11.810 --> 10:14.140
of his pretty intense
abandonment issues...

10:14.260 --> 10:15.690
which are not unchallenging.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.030
Mm.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.640
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.760
Well, have a nice life.

10:24.180 --> 10:26.460
What about Phil and
Claire to take care of Joe?

10:26.480 --> 10:29.030
I don't know. Isn't Phil kind of silly?

10:29.050 --> 10:32.160
What are you talking about?
Phil is a great father.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.360
He's kind.

10:33.390 --> 10:34.690
He's fun.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.160
Even Lily likes him.

10:36.190 --> 10:37.450
But is he too likeable?

10:37.480 --> 10:38.640
Where's the gravitas?

10:38.910 --> 10:40.510
He's full of energy.

10:40.530 --> 10:41.940
He's sensitive,

10:41.970 --> 10:44.260
and he never, ever gets grumpy.

10:44.290 --> 10:46.790
Fine. Why don't you give Joe
to Super Dad right now, then?

10:47.090 --> 10:49.350
Oh, my God, are you really jealous

10:49.380 --> 10:52.060
because Phil might be a
better father than you?

10:52.090 --> 10:53.370
I know it's stupid.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.970
Not to mention the fact that
Joe gets Claire in the deal.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.940
She's a fantastic mother.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.290
Runs a company, hell of a role model.

11:00.310 --> 11:02.120
He could never do better
than that for a mother.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.050
You know what, Phil and Claire
have already raised their kids.

11:04.070 --> 11:05.810
I think it's time for them to travel.

11:07.230 --> 11:08.300
There.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.720
That's where my
disappear bag was hanging!

11:13.170 --> 11:15.610
You have, like, a hundred
missed calls from Gloria.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.580
You have to come back right now.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.060
Is everything okay?

11:22.040 --> 11:23.300
What?

11:25.990 --> 11:27.410
There must be a bus stop nearby.

11:27.430 --> 11:28.790
Until then, just act normal

11:28.810 --> 11:30.880
like we don't have $40,000 on us.

11:30.910 --> 11:32.450
Okay, why are you whispering
only part of a sentence?

11:32.480 --> 11:34.660
- That's going to attract attention.
- Really?

11:34.690 --> 11:35.790
More than you being covered in sweat?

11:35.810 --> 11:37.340
Because you look like a sauna wall.

11:37.370 --> 11:39.160
You're right. How do I
make myself stop sweating?

11:39.190 --> 11:40.620
I don't know!

11:40.640 --> 11:42.190
Oh, don't cry. Crying's
worse than sweating.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.320
Oh look, now I'm crying too!

11:44.340 --> 11:46.800
Maybe we can smile our way out of this.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.080
Phil?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.400
- Yeah?
- Honey, come quick!

11:51.430 --> 11:53.910
- Your dad passed out in the RV.
- Oh, my God!

11:55.990 --> 11:57.150
Dad, are you okay?

11:57.180 --> 12:00.360
Yeah, Claire just accidentally
sprayed me with a garden hose.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.410
Really?

12:01.440 --> 12:03.400
- Oh, Claire?
- Sorry, stuck...

12:03.430 --> 12:05.810
like many father-son relationships.

12:08.490 --> 12:11.720
So, uh, place looks great.

12:11.750 --> 12:14.460
Yeah, Lorraine really
spruced it up. Curtains,

12:14.490 --> 12:16.320
brass safety rails over the privy.

12:16.350 --> 12:17.660
That was really a lifesaver.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.520
She stopped short on the I-90 once.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.290
I came rolling out of there
like a Chinese acrobat.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.180
Well, Lorraine seems good.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.030
Hey, so Phil, uh, you
seem a little off today.

12:30.050 --> 12:33.890
Me and Lorraine... uh, that
doesn't bother you, right?

12:34.460 --> 12:36.390
No. No.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.890
Good. It's the craziest thing.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.270
She re-introduced herself and, uh...

12:41.290 --> 12:43.580
I didn't even remember
she was our babysitter.

12:43.610 --> 12:44.940
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.150
Then she asked me out,

12:46.170 --> 12:47.470
and you know, I don't
get a lot of offers,

12:47.500 --> 12:49.570
so I thought, "What the heck?"

12:49.800 --> 12:51.150
Sure. That's what I figured.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.480
But, uh, I'm just
glad you're having fun.

12:53.510 --> 12:54.970
Well, I better go fill this thing up

12:55.000 --> 12:57.720
with some of Jay's expensive Scotch.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.710
Oh, actually, I think the door's locked.

12:59.740 --> 13:01.170
Oh, no, it's fine.

13:01.460 --> 13:04.700
Well, Frank, I'm really
sorry about that hose thing.

13:04.730 --> 13:06.700
Oh, no hard feelings.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.390
Shirt needed freshening anyway.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.920
I haven't washed it since we stopped
to take pictures at Smokey-Top,

13:11.950 --> 13:15.450
Utah's longest, continuously
burning tire fire.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.890
As I guess you heard, I
had no reason to be worried.

13:20.910 --> 13:23.090
He didn't even notice when
Lorraine was my babysitter.

13:23.110 --> 13:24.710
Plus, they're not even that serious.

13:24.740 --> 13:26.240
I felt a ring box in his pocket.

13:26.350 --> 13:27.620
What? No way.

13:27.650 --> 13:29.950
Yep. There's only one
thing shaped like that.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.130
No, there isn't. There's
a million things...

13:32.160 --> 13:33.990
Rubik's Cube, sewing kit,

13:34.120 --> 13:35.970
souvenir tire keychain from Smokey-Top.

13:35.990 --> 13:37.970
I can't think of anything
that's not shaped like that.

13:37.990 --> 13:39.450
Let's assume for a
moment that I am right

13:39.480 --> 13:41.040
and that was a ring box.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.430
Maybe it's worth exploring why
the idea of your dad remarrying

13:43.450 --> 13:44.590
is setting you off like this.

13:44.610 --> 13:47.970
Maybe it's worth exploring why you
find so much joy in tearing people down.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.120
In previous generations,

13:49.140 --> 13:50.610
they accused people like
that of being witches

13:50.630 --> 13:52.350
and threw water at them
to see if they screamed.

13:52.380 --> 13:53.380
Great.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.480
Aah!

13:54.500 --> 13:56.040
Witch.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.340
Ah, Mr. Pritchett I presume.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.210
Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

14:04.230 --> 14:05.820
I'm not sure I caught your name.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.080
- Keifth Banks.
- Yes.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.190
At your...

14:08.220 --> 14:11.300
Mitchell, sorry to interrupt. I didn't
know you were with a common worker.

14:11.820 --> 14:13.200
Can it be?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.320
Hmm?

14:14.350 --> 14:15.950
Cameron Tucker.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.280
Yes. I'm sorry. You are...?

14:18.300 --> 14:19.470
Keifth.

14:19.490 --> 14:20.890
Keifth. I-I don't believe I know...

14:20.920 --> 14:23.050
No, C-Cam, didn't you tell me

14:23.070 --> 14:25.370
you once dated someone named Keifth?

14:25.690 --> 14:28.420
Oh, yes. Keifth.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.630
What was it you did again?

14:29.650 --> 14:32.450
I remember you wore white
gloves and... and gestured a lot.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.520
Subway mime?

14:33.540 --> 14:36.210
I commanded a circus.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.150
Yes. Now I remember.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.220
How have you been?

14:39.250 --> 14:40.630
I see you're in pig delivery now?

14:40.650 --> 14:42.090
I'm a concierge.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.710
The circus business has
gotten rather difficult.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.340
People today, they
don't have the patience

14:46.360 --> 14:48.660
for the more elegant
pleasures of yesteryear...

14:48.680 --> 14:51.030
men putting their heads
into lion's mouths,

14:51.240 --> 14:53.450
unfortunate little people
being shot from cannons.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.940
I can't believe you... you're
meeting up again like this.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.010
You must have so much to catch up on

14:58.030 --> 14:59.700
or... or... or work through.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.500
Oh, well, I'm sure Keifth would rather

15:01.520 --> 15:04.150
just make the delivery and disappear.

15:04.180 --> 15:05.320
Start there.

15:05.340 --> 15:07.240
To the matter at hand.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.320
The swap will be difficult.

15:09.590 --> 15:12.230
Fortunately, I have had a bit
of experience with misdirects...

15:12.250 --> 15:15.350
just tell the audience to keep
your eyes on the center ring!

15:15.540 --> 15:17.440
They won't even notice
the trapeze act suffering

15:17.460 --> 15:19.670
through the more vivid
stages of food poisoning.

15:19.930 --> 15:21.610
- That happened. I was there.
- Oh.

15:21.640 --> 15:26.170
First, I will release a live peacock...

15:26.580 --> 15:29.480
an exotic beauty of the
Orient... into the yard.

15:29.510 --> 15:30.680
Magical.

15:30.710 --> 15:34.420
Then, I will need
something to lure him inside

15:34.580 --> 15:36.110
to draw the family's attention.

15:36.140 --> 15:38.250
Do you happen to have
any Andalusian filberts?

15:38.270 --> 15:39.270
No.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.570
Then Cheez-Its will do.

15:40.590 --> 15:42.050
Naturally, everyone will be transfixed.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.470
And while they're distracted,
we will swap out the pigs,

15:44.700 --> 15:47.870
the dinner will be saved,
and the show will go on.

15:47.890 --> 15:50.060
Just let me sneak a
peek at the backyard.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.520
Goodbye.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.520
Hey, Joe,

15:55.550 --> 15:59.280
what has two heads,
four legs, and can fly?

15:59.310 --> 16:00.740
I don't know.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.630
Us. Aah!

16:02.660 --> 16:04.090
This is dangerous!

16:04.110 --> 16:06.150
That's how you know we're alive!

16:06.450 --> 16:08.030
It's like I said in my wedding toast...

16:08.060 --> 16:09.680
that bride of yours is fearless.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.000
Yeah.

16:11.660 --> 16:14.210
Funny thing is, we went to an
amusement park earlier today

16:14.240 --> 16:17.350
and she was too scared
to get on this one ride.

16:17.850 --> 16:20.080
Or she pretended to be

16:20.110 --> 16:22.740
so that I wouldn't have
to admit how scared I was.

16:23.810 --> 16:25.510
I have a hunch that
she's not the only one

16:25.540 --> 16:27.740
who's trying to protect
my feelings today.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.890
You seem to be rambling, son.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.590
When you hugged Claire earlier,

16:33.620 --> 16:35.590
she felt a ring box in your pocket.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.760
What? That wasn't a ring box.

16:37.780 --> 16:40.580
It was... Where am I?
I'm so old and confused.

16:40.610 --> 16:41.940
Stop.

16:42.190 --> 16:43.620
I'm not gonna say
seeing you with Lorraine

16:43.640 --> 16:45.050
wasn't a little bit weird for me.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.850
It was a crazy idea.

16:46.870 --> 16:47.890
That's not what I'm trying to say.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.430
That pig's got to be ready, doesn't it?

16:49.460 --> 16:50.560
Dad, please.

16:50.580 --> 16:53.010
Son, can we please not do this?

16:53.640 --> 16:54.980
Fine.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.480
- Knock, knock.
- That's more like it.

16:57.510 --> 16:58.670
Who's there?

16:58.700 --> 17:00.280
- Your son.
- Your son, who?

17:00.300 --> 17:02.720
Your son who'd hate to think you
threw away a shot at happiness

17:02.750 --> 17:04.329
just to protect his feelings.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.390
Here it is. All here.
Just take it from me.

17:09.410 --> 17:10.470
That's the most stress I've ever felt,

17:10.490 --> 17:11.510
and I spent two weeks underground

17:11.530 --> 17:12.849
as part of an isolation study.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.440
Okay. So, I guess now
we can finish this.

17:15.470 --> 17:17.730
Ay, Mitch. Mitch, come. Help us finish.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.420
Okay. Okay. We got to
lightning round these forms.

17:20.450 --> 17:22.089
You guys are overthinking this.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.750
Everybody knows in their
heart what they want.

17:23.780 --> 17:25.780
They just feel bad about
making the decision.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.220
So, who will be the
executor of your estate? Go.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.730
- You.
- Aww. Okay.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.070
Um, do you want to leave
anything to charity?

17:32.090 --> 17:36.090
Yes. 10% to whatever is
sexy at the time we die...

17:36.110 --> 17:38.240
like, um, orphans or whatever.

17:38.270 --> 17:39.690
Okay, okay, yeah. And what about Stella?

17:39.710 --> 17:40.750
Same as Manny.

17:40.780 --> 17:43.230
No, he's asking who's
gonna take care of her,

17:43.250 --> 17:46.140
not how much money you're
gonna leave to a murderer.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.110
No proof of that.

17:47.130 --> 17:48.270
Okay, this seems like a whole sidebar,

17:48.290 --> 17:49.660
so we're gonna circle back to that.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.040
Um, who do you want as
Joe's legal guardian?

17:52.600 --> 17:54.170
No, no, don't think. Just answer, okay?

17:54.200 --> 17:55.710
If something happens to both of you,

17:55.730 --> 17:57.420
who do you want to take care of Joe?

17:58.670 --> 17:59.910
Me, obviously.

17:59.940 --> 18:02.520
Ay, Manny, you're too young.

18:02.550 --> 18:05.110
Besides, you're about to
start your new life soon.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.680
Yeah, you should be out sowing
your oats or just sewing.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.110
That's something you like.

18:09.140 --> 18:10.540
I don't see what the big deal is.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.840
I'd hire a nanny, sell the
house, downsize to a condo.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.650
I'm thinking maybe a loft in
an up-and-coming arts district.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.950
Sure, it'll take me a bit
longer to finish college,

18:18.980 --> 18:21.490
but aren't those the best
years of life, anyway?

18:21.520 --> 18:23.390
The main thing is, he's my brother.

18:23.410 --> 18:25.050
I'm not letting anybody else raise him.

18:25.070 --> 18:28.090
Ay, Manny. You're so sweet.

18:28.110 --> 18:29.310
Am I the only one unsettled

18:29.340 --> 18:31.270
by how much he's thought
about that already?

18:35.330 --> 18:37.410
- Oh, my God! Look!
- What?

18:37.430 --> 18:40.430
Cast your spell, nature's kaleidoscope!

18:40.460 --> 18:42.410
Why is there a blue turkey
going into the house?

18:42.440 --> 18:43.550
It's a peacock.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.220
It's really plowing
through the Cheez-Its.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.600
Oh, we forgot to put the
apple the new pig's mouth.

18:48.630 --> 18:50.030
Oh, just leave it.

18:50.350 --> 18:52.430
Now that's your answer
to everything, isn't it?

18:52.460 --> 18:53.960
I deserve that.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.790
I was a fool to think
I could get through this

18:55.810 --> 18:57.310
without you bringing up the way I left.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.870
Well, you broke my heart.

18:58.890 --> 19:00.790
I didn't mean to hurt you, Cameron.

19:01.410 --> 19:02.690
I just had to protect myself.

19:02.710 --> 19:04.100
When we first met, you were just...

19:04.120 --> 19:06.790
pure, raw potential.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.690
Your Missouri twang.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.930
The innocent way your shirt cuffs

19:11.960 --> 19:13.680
were no different than your sleeves.

19:14.230 --> 19:15.940
Once you emerged from
your country cocoon,

19:15.960 --> 19:17.610
I knew it was just a matter of time

19:17.630 --> 19:20.530
before you realized you
could do better and moved on.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.600
But you never even said goodbye.

19:22.630 --> 19:24.560
For all these years, I-I
thought it was my fault.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.120
Oh, no.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.560
No.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.170
I was a coward.

19:31.530 --> 19:35.440
I just ran away to join another circus.

19:37.170 --> 19:38.520
I suppose you could say the...

19:38.540 --> 19:40.970
the one ring you never
mastered was the ring of life.

19:40.990 --> 19:43.200
Well, that's kind of mean, but sure.

19:43.460 --> 19:45.910
- And look at your beautiful home.
- Oh, it's...

19:45.930 --> 19:47.880
You've blossomed into the
success I always knew you'd be.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.190
Correct.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.380
I did so enjoy our
time together, Cameron.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.280
Remember that split week
between Lansing and Kalamazoo?

19:56.310 --> 19:57.630
Oh, my gosh, how could I forget?

19:57.650 --> 20:00.450
The rain dripping on the canvas.

20:00.650 --> 20:03.050
Me sneaking into your
wagon after curfew.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.230
I believe that was the
first time you saw me...

20:05.500 --> 20:07.380
without my top hat.

20:07.410 --> 20:08.410
Okay.

20:08.430 --> 20:09.600
Well, wounds healed,

20:09.620 --> 20:11.610
whole new perspective, off you go.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.460
Goodbye, Cameron.

20:15.490 --> 20:16.830
Goodbye, Keifth.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.540
Oh, hey, honey.

20:21.570 --> 20:22.950
- I, uh...
- Whatcha doing?

20:23.490 --> 20:26.440
Oh, I think it's cute how scared he is.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.190
Yeah, but he's doing it.

20:28.210 --> 20:29.490
Yes.

20:29.510 --> 20:32.890
There's one Dunphy who's not
afraid to live dangerously.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.260
Oh.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.520
Hey, Claire?

20:37.950 --> 20:40.110
They're open for two more hours.

20:40.730 --> 20:43.700
Everything's gonna be okay.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.280
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

20:45.310 --> 20:46.800
2017!

20:46.820 --> 20:49.370
It's gonna be a great yea...

20:53.110 --> 20:54.560
Phil?

20:54.580 --> 20:55.780
Oh.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.120
Cam, this is so delicious.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.220
Well, you know, after Thanksgiving,

21:03.250 --> 21:05.180
I'm just happy nothing went wrong.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.380
I love this seasoning.

21:06.410 --> 21:08.180
What gives it that nutty taste?

21:08.210 --> 21:09.520
It might be nuts, sweetheart.

21:09.540 --> 21:10.890
Oh, no, he wouldn't put nuts in it.

21:10.910 --> 21:12.420
He knows I'm allergic.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.660
Excuse me.

21:14.680 --> 21:15.830
Hi.

21:15.850 --> 21:16.890
Hey, how was the ride?

21:16.920 --> 21:18.500
Amazing. Phil fainted.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.340
- Claire.
- Oh, come on, they were gonna find out.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.030
I'm not spending $15 on this picture

21:22.050 --> 21:24.320
and not show it to everyone.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.670
I'm just gonna need you
to spit into this napkin.

21:26.690 --> 21:28.710
- EpiPen is on the way.
- Just keep the card.

21:28.730 --> 21:31.090
Isn't that amazing?
