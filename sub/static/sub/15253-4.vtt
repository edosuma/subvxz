00:01.200 --> 00:02.634
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.
Here are a few things</i>

00:02.702 --> 00:04.402
<i>that you might need to know.
Alejandro Fulgencio Goya,</i>

00:04.469 --> 00:06.870
chief military officer
of Costa Gravas.

00:06.937 --> 00:08.070
You saved my life.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.204
How can I ever
hope to repay you?

00:10.272 --> 00:11.672
SARAH:
Casey!

00:11.740 --> 00:13.874
Gonna be laid up for a while.
Well, maybe you could

00:13.942 --> 00:15.741
<i>use the time to meet up
with Alex,</i>

00:15.809 --> 00:17.275
<i>figure out what your role is
in her life.</i>

00:17.343 --> 00:19.410
Why do you have
my daughter's phone number?

00:19.477 --> 00:20.410
(low growl)

00:20.478 --> 00:22.078
I do need to take
things... slow.

00:22.145 --> 00:24.379
Super slow.

00:28.483 --> 00:30.683
SARAH:
Oh! Uh...

00:30.751 --> 00:31.684
Whoa!

00:31.751 --> 00:32.683
Whoa.

00:32.752 --> 00:34.051
Wow.

00:34.119 --> 00:35.385
The...

00:42.791 --> 00:44.691
You're not...
I-I mean...

00:44.759 --> 00:45.792
No! Oh, no, no.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.928
This... I don't want...

00:47.996 --> 00:49.963
It was here, it was
on the... it was on the ground.

00:50.030 --> 00:51.964
Of course, with the one knee,
you were assum...

00:52.032 --> 00:53.799
but no, not, that's not it.

00:53.867 --> 00:55.934
Well, I'm going
to go talk to...

00:56.002 --> 00:57.301
I'm gonna go exercise.

01:00.339 --> 01:02.407
CHUCK:
So awkward.

01:03.909 --> 01:06.943
In a world filled with awkward
Chuck and Sarah moments

01:07.011 --> 01:08.378
<i>comes one moment
so awkward...</i>

01:08.446 --> 01:09.813
Morgan.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.813
...that it will have...

01:10.881 --> 01:11.948
Morgan!

01:12.015 --> 01:13.416
Please, don't torture me.

01:13.483 --> 01:15.885
Sarah and I haven't spoken
one word about what happened,

01:15.953 --> 01:17.486
and even though
I wasn't proposing,

01:17.554 --> 01:20.722
I'd like to know if
thinking I might have been

01:20.790 --> 01:24.125
was, you know,
good news or horrible news.

01:24.192 --> 01:25.793
She's acting like
nothing ever happened.

01:25.861 --> 01:27.060
I get it, I get it.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.095
Your woman
is a hot mystery--

01:29.163 --> 01:30.764
we both know that--

01:30.831 --> 01:32.665
but I'm actually
more interested

01:32.733 --> 01:35.834
in this piece of the puzzle.

01:35.902 --> 01:37.669
Now...

01:37.737 --> 01:39.304
would you have been happy
if she accidentally said yes

01:39.372 --> 01:40.639
to your accidental proposal?

01:40.707 --> 01:43.674
That's what's
on the table.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.645
I mean, I didn't think
we were there yet, but...

01:48.713 --> 01:50.647
maybe.

01:50.714 --> 01:51.814
Well, I tell you what.

01:51.882 --> 01:53.616
Before there are any proposals,

01:53.683 --> 01:54.950
I'll tell you
what I know.

01:55.018 --> 01:56.084
You both are,

01:56.152 --> 01:58.286
without a doubt,
crap communicators.

01:58.354 --> 01:59.621
Well, I...
No, no,
hold on a second.

01:59.689 --> 02:01.856
Precious looks
and whimsical little make-ups

02:01.924 --> 02:02.990
after big misunderstandings,

02:03.058 --> 02:06.093
you guys are fantastic,
sure, but...

02:06.161 --> 02:07.528
actual real live day-to-day

02:07.595 --> 02:09.096
open communication
about your feelings?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.330
I get it.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.732
We could be better
communicators, fine.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.833
So what now?

02:13.901 --> 02:15.468
A self-help book?

02:15.536 --> 02:17.203
No.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.038
This isn't just
any self-help book.

02:19.106 --> 02:21.007
<i>This is Dr. Fred's 101
Conversations Before "I Do."</i>

02:21.075 --> 02:22.675
Yeah, but I can't
bring Sarah a book

02:22.743 --> 02:24.076
about getting to "I do."

02:24.144 --> 02:27.312
We just had a talk about how she
needs to take it slow, buddy.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.647
Don't show her the book,

02:28.715 --> 02:31.116
but use it as a tool
to help you guys talk, man.

02:31.183 --> 02:33.451
Look, we can communicate without
the help of a book, okay?

02:33.519 --> 02:34.786
We're not that bad.

02:34.853 --> 02:36.220
You're great.
You're right, I'm sorry, yeah.

02:36.288 --> 02:37.755
I mean, you don't know
whether or not you proposed,

02:37.822 --> 02:39.156
or if you did,
if you're happy about it,

02:39.224 --> 02:40.757
or if she said yes or no
to what may or may not

02:40.825 --> 02:42.459
have been a proposal,
or if either of you ever

02:42.527 --> 02:43.526
want you to actually
ask her for real.

02:43.594 --> 02:45.295
Yeah?

02:45.362 --> 02:46.829
Yeah, you don't need no book.

02:46.897 --> 02:48.831
You're fine.

02:48.899 --> 02:50.366
You're the perfect couple.

02:50.433 --> 02:52.668
CAPTAIN:
And when you're older,

02:52.735 --> 02:54.169
You and Daddy can
work out together.

02:54.237 --> 02:55.504
This is one of Daddy's

02:55.571 --> 02:58.673
favorite jams
for tri-blasting.

02:58.741 --> 03:00.808
Devon.
Yeah.

03:00.876 --> 03:03.210
Do you realize that you haven't
addressed me in over an hour?

03:03.278 --> 03:05.379
Oh. Sorry, babe.

03:05.447 --> 03:08.449
Hey, I gotta talk to Mommy
for a minute, okay?

03:10.251 --> 03:11.251
Hello, beautiful.

03:11.319 --> 03:13.387
Hello.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.655
We need to talk.

03:14.722 --> 03:17.758
I am, uh, feeling
a little over-babied.

03:17.825 --> 03:19.326
I'm not even four
months pregnant,

03:19.394 --> 03:20.827
and it's all
we talk about.

03:20.895 --> 03:23.095
My hot husband suddenly
drives a minivan.

03:23.163 --> 03:25.097
Yeah, an awesome minivan.

03:25.165 --> 03:28.399
Toyota Sienna, safest
family auto in its class.

03:28.467 --> 03:29.700
I'm just saying that
maybe we could...

03:29.768 --> 03:31.535
maybe we could get away,
go somewhere, like...

03:31.603 --> 03:33.005
Let's take a babymoon.

03:33.074 --> 03:34.908
Oh, babe, I'd love to.

03:34.975 --> 03:38.811
But colleges can cost over
$300,000 grand by 2028.

03:38.879 --> 03:40.280
We gotta prioritize.

03:40.347 --> 03:41.881
The baby's not even here yet.

03:41.949 --> 03:44.851
Can't we just spend these
last few months as just us?

03:44.918 --> 03:46.853
You need a break from babyland.

03:46.920 --> 03:47.854
Yes.

03:47.921 --> 03:48.888
I am with you, honey.

03:48.956 --> 03:49.889
Okay.

03:49.957 --> 03:51.057
Okay.

03:51.125 --> 03:52.525
(whispering):
We'll talk later, huh?

03:52.593 --> 03:54.460
<i>BECKMAN:
Good evening, team.</i>

03:54.528 --> 03:57.130
Comandante Juan Pablo Turrini.

03:57.198 --> 04:01.801
Most trusted advisor to Cost
Gravan Premier Alejandro Goya.

04:01.869 --> 04:04.904
Ah! The Generalissimo.

04:04.972 --> 04:06.639
Casey, you're supposed
to in bed recovering.

04:06.707 --> 04:08.741
Getting some fresh air.

04:08.809 --> 04:11.110
In an underground bunker.

04:11.178 --> 04:12.278
(Beckman clears throat)
So what's with Turrini?

04:12.345 --> 04:13.746
I ran into him a couple of times

04:13.814 --> 04:15.247
when I was trying
to kill the Generalissimo.

04:15.315 --> 04:17.950
He's the head
of Costa Gravan Secret Police,

04:18.017 --> 04:19.584
and he's in town unannounced,

04:19.653 --> 04:21.452
which is extremely unusual.

04:21.521 --> 04:23.789
I want everyone
who wasn't shot recently

04:23.857 --> 04:26.125
to stake out the embassy
to see if he turns up.

04:26.192 --> 04:28.661
Everyone else should be in bed.

04:34.635 --> 04:36.502
<i>SARAH:
No sign of
Costa Gravan activity.</i>

04:43.978 --> 04:45.078
Sarah?

04:45.146 --> 04:46.980
Yeah?

04:47.048 --> 04:49.149
What is it, Chuck?

04:49.217 --> 04:50.984
Um...

04:52.486 --> 04:54.119
<i>We are crap
communicators.</i>

04:54.187 --> 04:55.387
What?

04:55.455 --> 04:58.158
Why are we so afraid to talk
about the whole ring thing?

04:58.225 --> 04:59.792
You know?
I mean, we're in love.

04:59.860 --> 05:02.161
You wear your teeth-bleaching
system in front of me.

05:02.229 --> 05:04.764
We should be
able to talk, no?

05:04.831 --> 05:07.165
Okay. Well, um,
let's talk about it.

05:07.233 --> 05:09.835
Okay! Okay.

05:09.902 --> 05:11.503
Well, first of all,
first of all,

05:11.571 --> 05:12.838
you know that-that
definitely was not

05:12.906 --> 05:15.708
a... proposal, right?

05:15.776 --> 05:18.111
Yes! Yes, uh,
totally, of course.

05:18.178 --> 05:19.379
Of course.

05:19.446 --> 05:20.647
Of course?
I mean, it could've been

05:20.715 --> 05:22.348
misconstrued.

05:26.118 --> 05:30.422
Morgan-- I know--
Morgan gave me this book.

05:30.489 --> 05:32.057
This kind of, you know...

05:32.125 --> 05:36.127
It's a silly book, full of
silly things, like questions,

05:36.195 --> 05:37.895
that you're supposed
to ask your partner

05:37.963 --> 05:39.696
to help you get talking about
the hard to talk about things.

05:39.763 --> 05:41.531
So I was thinking...

05:41.599 --> 05:43.366
I don't know,
maybe we'll...
Should I read it?

05:43.433 --> 05:44.566
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:44.634 --> 05:46.001
I'll read it.

05:46.068 --> 05:47.869
I'll read it, and I'll
ask you the questions, yeah.

05:47.937 --> 05:49.170
And then we can
have a series

05:49.238 --> 05:50.672
of emotionally stimulating
conversations.

05:52.275 --> 05:54.209
Or at least that's what
the back cover says.

05:54.277 --> 05:55.844
Walker, Bartowski,
we have new information.

05:55.911 --> 05:58.213
What is it?

05:58.281 --> 06:00.816
Our satellite picked up
Turrini's motorcade.

06:00.884 --> 06:02.551
He's not headed to the embassy.

06:03.653 --> 06:05.754
So then, where is he heading?

Dr. Woodcomb.</i>

06:17.632 --> 06:20.267
Costa Gravas calls once more.

07:09.591 --> 07:10.757
What's going on?

07:11.726 --> 07:13.894
Hey, bro. Just in time.

07:13.962 --> 07:15.830
TURRINI:
Good evening.

07:15.897 --> 07:17.832
I am Comandante
Juan Pablo Turrini.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.034
I am here to deliver
a personal message

07:20.102 --> 07:21.336
from the Generalissimo.

07:22.806 --> 07:24.272
(Latin music plays)

07:26.342 --> 07:28.342
<i>Hola, Devon Woodcomb.</i>

07:29.544 --> 07:30.644
And bride!

07:30.711 --> 07:32.312
(laughs)

07:32.380 --> 07:34.881
I've been so wanting
to thank you

07:34.949 --> 07:36.216
for saving my life,

07:36.284 --> 07:38.751
and I think the best way
is just to invite you here

07:38.819 --> 07:40.019
to my little bit of Paradise.

07:40.087 --> 07:43.757
Costa Gravas is beautiful
at this time of year,

07:43.824 --> 07:46.660
as is my private jet
that will fly you here.

07:46.728 --> 07:48.529
Private jet.

07:48.596 --> 07:50.898
Enjoy my beaches, eh?

07:52.300 --> 07:54.201
        My jungles!
(monkey screeches)

07:55.770 --> 07:57.237
My palace!

07:57.305 --> 07:59.072
Allow me to drench you both,
please, in luxury

07:59.140 --> 08:00.240
this very weekend.

08:00.308 --> 08:03.443
Come... to Costa Gravas!

08:03.511 --> 08:06.346
Devon, babymoon.

08:06.414 --> 08:08.581
CAPTAIN:
Babe, it's not safe.

08:08.649 --> 08:10.584
We can't go.
Come on...

08:10.651 --> 08:12.786
Sarah, is it safe?

08:12.854 --> 08:15.990
Well, actually, Costa Gravas
is stable right now.

08:16.057 --> 08:18.059
Actually, Costa Gravas
is very stable.

08:18.127 --> 08:20.595
We have peace now.

08:20.662 --> 08:22.062
And Subway sandwich franchises.

08:22.130 --> 08:23.865
Mmm.
Mmm.

08:23.932 --> 08:25.934
Come on. It sounds like the most
amazing couple's weekend.

08:26.002 --> 08:27.636
We could go, too, you know.

08:27.704 --> 08:28.770
Yeah.

08:28.838 --> 08:30.873
If it would make you
feel safer, Sarah could...

08:30.940 --> 08:32.408
could be there, relaxing,
talking...

08:33.707 --> 08:34.975
In a bikini.

08:35.042 --> 08:36.942
You are both more
than welcome.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.711
Plus, you will be staying
at the palace.

08:38.778 --> 08:40.645
There is no safer

08:40.714 --> 08:42.648
or more luxurious place
in all the world.

08:42.716 --> 08:44.816
<i>MORGAN:
Prepare for luxury.</i>

08:46.952 --> 08:49.387
Oh... (sighs)

08:49.454 --> 08:51.021
There you go.

08:52.457 --> 08:53.957
Snuggles, huh?

08:54.025 --> 08:55.592
Okay. Do you need anything else?

08:55.660 --> 08:57.160
I don't need anything.

08:58.763 --> 08:59.930
Okay.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.733
That's fine.
I understand.

09:02.801 --> 09:03.934
(doorbell rings,
knocking on door)

09:04.002 --> 09:05.069
I'll get it.

09:05.137 --> 09:07.104
I'll get it.
No, no, no, no. Stay!

09:07.172 --> 09:08.271
I will get it.

09:08.339 --> 09:11.006
I'm supposed to be
helping you, Casey.

09:11.074 --> 09:12.908
Morgan!
Alex!

09:12.976 --> 09:14.776
Daughter.
Dad.

09:15.811 --> 09:17.311
You're in a
wheelchair.

09:17.379 --> 09:18.779
You said that you
were just sick.

09:18.847 --> 09:21.349
Oh, just shot in the leg. Fine.

09:21.417 --> 09:24.019
Well, I...
brought you soup.

09:25.554 --> 09:28.055
I didn't know you were
going to be here, Morgan.

09:29.324 --> 09:30.825
How did, uh,

09:30.893 --> 09:32.360
how did the pot roast turn out?

09:32.428 --> 09:34.762
Um...

09:34.830 --> 09:36.430
uh... great.

09:36.498 --> 09:39.467

20:24.762 --> 20:26.228
<i>The Angel de la Muerte--</i>

20:26.296 --> 20:29.364
he hid in these very walls
for two weeks trying to kill me.

20:29.432 --> 20:31.266
I was in Havana
with Castro the whole time.

20:31.334 --> 20:33.368
(Generalissimo laughing)
I heard that.

20:38.341 --> 20:40.576
This way.
My plane awaits.

20:41.845 --> 20:45.380
(camera shutter clicking)

20:45.448 --> 20:46.281
Come on,
come on, come on.

20:46.349 --> 20:48.817
(clicking)

20:56.025 --> 20:59.094
I cannot believe that there
was a coup on my babymoon.

20:59.162 --> 21:01.463
Chuck, thank God
that you were there.

21:01.531 --> 21:03.965
You were so amazing, really.

21:04.032 --> 21:06.534
Seriously, bro.
Thank you.

21:06.601 --> 21:10.137
I just wanted to save the day
before Awesome got a chance to.

21:11.639 --> 21:13.573
I am so sorry that

21:13.641 --> 21:15.708
I made us go there.
It was so stupid of me.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.376
No, it wasn't stupid.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.877
We do need time away.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.612
That's why, when we go home,
we're going straight to Malibu.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.848
I hear you, hon.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.583
And this babymoon will happen.

21:33.964 --> 21:36.265
Just look at them, Sarah.

21:38.702 --> 21:40.803
They're like
communication all-stars.

21:40.871 --> 21:45.975
That's all great, but we have a
homeless dictator on our hands.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.843
GENERALISSIMO:
I mean, I knew
things had cooled

21:47.911 --> 21:49.745
over the years
between Hortencia and myself,

21:49.813 --> 21:52.648
but a coup d'état?

21:52.716 --> 21:54.950
We used to finish each
other's sentences.

21:55.018 --> 21:57.353
TURRINI:
I know, Generalissimo, I know.

21:57.420 --> 21:58.787
The Costa Gravan embassy
in Los Angeles

21:58.855 --> 22:00.189
is preparing
for your arrival.

22:00.257 --> 22:02.157
Are you crazy?

22:02.225 --> 22:03.893
If I cannot trust
my wife now,

22:03.960 --> 22:05.527
how am I supposed
to trust my embassy?

22:05.595 --> 22:07.931
Uh, we can try to
arrange a CIA safe house

22:07.998 --> 22:09.799
with some guards
for the time being.

22:09.867 --> 22:13.503
No, I know where I will go now.

22:13.571 --> 22:16.706
There is only one person
to whom I trust my life now.

22:17.742 --> 22:20.477
<i>John Casey.</i>

22:20.544 --> 22:22.679
So...

22:22.746 --> 22:24.647
roomies.

22:24.715 --> 22:27.149
The wheelchair is not as
intimidating as I would hope,

22:27.217 --> 22:28.884
but...

22:28.952 --> 22:30.986
your casa is my casa, huh?

22:42.521 --> 22:45.089
What a freaking disaster.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.392
Morning, boss.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.427
Morning, Big Mike.

22:49.495 --> 22:51.329
Oh, Big Mike, hey,
I could use some advice.

22:51.396 --> 22:52.330
I'm having a little

22:52.397 --> 22:54.465
lady trouble.

22:54.533 --> 22:56.367
A son asking
his new daddy

22:56.435 --> 22:58.302
for love advice.
Yeah.

22:58.370 --> 22:59.604
I could well up.

22:59.671 --> 23:00.638
Please don't.

23:00.706 --> 23:02.373
Here's the thing--
I-I met this girl,

23:02.441 --> 23:04.542
and there's
this wonderful connection,

23:04.610 --> 23:06.644
and I think she might be it,

23:06.712 --> 23:09.714
except there's this, like,
this little detail.

23:09.781 --> 23:11.515
It's Casey's daughter.

23:14.252 --> 23:16.387
Yeah, well,

23:16.455 --> 23:18.456
that's not a daddy you want
giving you a spanking.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.524
We agree.
Well, son,

23:20.592 --> 23:22.660
you have to decide whether
this girl is really it or not,

23:22.727 --> 23:24.795
because if she is,

23:24.863 --> 23:27.064
there is no arm or leg
worth as much

23:27.132 --> 23:29.400
as the love of a good woman.

23:32.103 --> 23:35.305
SARAH:
The computer is analyzing the
photos I took in Costa Gravas.

23:35.373 --> 23:38.109
I'm sorry our vacation
didn't work out.

23:38.177 --> 23:39.477
No, hey, whatever.

23:39.545 --> 23:41.880
I mean, we can still keep
having conversations anyway.

23:41.948 --> 23:44.718
I mean, we've got,
like, 87 more to go,

23:44.785 --> 23:46.887
and the next few
are about sex.

23:46.955 --> 23:48.822
Chuck, we have a mission.

23:48.890 --> 23:50.190
We don't need to talk
about our sex life.

23:50.258 --> 23:52.158
Sarah, there's always
going to be a mission,

23:52.226 --> 23:54.193
and I think it's important
that we make time to talk,

23:54.260 --> 23:55.726
even about the awkward stuff.

23:55.794 --> 23:58.659
In fact, you know,
if it is the awkward thing,

23:58.727 --> 24:01.428
Dr. Fred suggests talking
about the difficult things

24:01.496 --> 24:02.863
to your partner
while they're sleeping.

24:02.931 --> 24:04.898
I'm not going to talk
to you while you're asleep.

24:04.966 --> 24:06.500
This book sounds
kind of ridiculous.

24:06.568 --> 24:07.901
Okay, so it's not,
it's not perfect,

24:07.969 --> 24:09.636
but I do think
it's helping us talk.

24:10.872 --> 24:14.241
Dr. Fred is world-renowned,
after all.

24:23.082 --> 24:24.216
<i>101 Conversations</i>

24:24.284 --> 24:26.718
<i>Before "I Do"?</i>

24:26.786 --> 24:29.388
That's the book, the one
covered in wedding rings?

24:31.157 --> 24:33.091
Yeah.

24:33.159 --> 24:35.760
I thought we talked about this.

24:35.828 --> 24:37.762
I thought we were going
to take it slow.

24:37.830 --> 24:40.566
I know, I know we did, and
we are going to take it slow.

24:40.634 --> 24:44.936
It's just...
you know, someday

24:45.004 --> 24:47.071
maybe we could talk
about that.

24:47.139 --> 24:49.841
And it takes a long time
to have 101 conversations.

24:49.908 --> 24:52.310
Why do we always have to talk
and push and change things?

24:52.377 --> 24:53.744
Why can't we just be?

25:00.785 --> 25:03.387
Uh, Sarah...

25:03.454 --> 25:04.654
Everything is great.

25:04.722 --> 25:06.456
What if we do "I do,"
and it changes us?

25:06.524 --> 25:08.492
It's nuclear.

25:08.559 --> 25:10.560
Exactly, everything we love
about us could be destroyed.

25:10.628 --> 25:12.829
No, not us, the weapon.

25:12.896 --> 25:14.930
It's a nuclear
control panel.

25:14.998 --> 25:18.767
The Costa Gravans
have nukes.

25:18.835 --> 25:20.736
<i>BECKMAN:
Costa Gravas is nuclear?!</i>

25:20.804 --> 25:22.304
GENERALISSIMO:
All right, yes.

25:22.372 --> 25:24.172
(chuckles)

25:24.240 --> 25:27.108
I have a nuclear weapons
control panel in my basement.

25:27.176 --> 25:28.610
This is such ugliness.

25:28.677 --> 25:29.778
How does it work?

25:29.845 --> 25:31.947
There are nuclear missiles
at sites

25:32.015 --> 25:33.415
throughout
the Costa Gravan jungle.

25:33.483 --> 25:35.183
They're all aimed
at different cities,

25:35.250 --> 25:36.617
mostly American.

25:36.685 --> 25:38.353
Look, it takes
two keys, okay,

25:38.420 --> 25:40.622
two keys to use the system.

25:40.689 --> 25:41.856
One of them is right here.

25:41.924 --> 25:44.358
It's around my neck, see?

25:45.759 --> 25:47.293
You have one key.

25:47.361 --> 25:49.295
Where is the other one?

25:49.363 --> 25:53.234
This is so embarrassing,
you know?

25:55.171 --> 25:57.105
I gave it away

25:57.172 --> 26:00.674
years ago to the person
I trusted the most.

26:02.209 --> 26:03.710
Okay?

26:05.012 --> 26:06.980
My wife.

26:07.047 --> 26:09.483
The woman who has just
taken over your country?

26:09.551 --> 26:11.485
You have questioned the
Generalissimo enough

26:11.553 --> 26:13.286
for one night.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.588
He lost his country
and his love today.

26:15.656 --> 26:16.856
He must rest.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.023
BECKMAN:
All right.

26:18.091 --> 26:20.926
Colonel Casey,
watch the Generalissimo closely.

26:20.994 --> 26:22.461
We'll speak more in the morning.

26:22.528 --> 26:24.696
Walker and Bartowski,
private line.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.102
You two are going back
to Costa Gravas.

26:31.170 --> 26:33.639
We can't have a rogue leader
with nuclear capabilities.

26:33.707 --> 26:34.874
Meet with Colonel Casey

26:34.942 --> 26:36.644
about the layout
of the palace tonight,

26:36.712 --> 26:38.378
and leave first thing
in the morning.

26:38.446 --> 26:39.579
Yes, ma'am.

26:41.349 --> 26:44.051
Isn't life funny, Colonel Casey?

26:44.118 --> 26:45.986
That I would be here, hmm,

26:46.054 --> 26:48.155
guarded by the
Angel of Death?

26:48.223 --> 26:49.790
Forgive me--

26:49.858 --> 26:51.325
the Angel of Life.

26:51.392 --> 26:54.660
That I would be
here and wondering

26:54.727 --> 26:55.660
where will I go next?

26:55.728 --> 26:56.995
I got to be honest.

26:57.063 --> 26:58.930
This isn't how I thought
it'd end up for you.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.534
Why?

27:02.601 --> 27:06.104
Well, I wrote a report
back in '91

27:06.172 --> 27:09.040
theorizing you'd be taken down
by someone else altogether,

27:09.108 --> 27:12.844
someone whose politics
never moved to the center,

27:12.912 --> 27:14.846
as have yours.

27:14.913 --> 27:18.783
Someone who could never take
his eyes off your wife.

27:22.087 --> 27:24.355
Move around behind me,
Generalissimo.

27:36.668 --> 27:38.768
Do not make me shoot a man
in a wheelchair.

27:46.175 --> 27:47.609
Better?

27:47.677 --> 27:49.878
Generalissimo,

27:49.946 --> 27:52.514
you're coming
with me.

27:52.582 --> 27:55.587
Hortencia and I need your key.

27:55.655 --> 27:57.791
You're not going anywhere,
Generalissimo.

27:57.859 --> 27:59.059
I think you are.

27:59.127 --> 28:00.327
(guns cocking)

28:05.299 --> 28:07.301
Cute.

28:07.368 --> 28:09.136
Too bad you didn't bring enough.

28:09.203 --> 28:10.804
<i>Ahora...</i>

28:12.373 --> 28:15.109
<i>¿Quién quiere morir primero?</i>

28:19.815 --> 28:22.549
I'm sorry, my friend.

28:24.552 --> 28:27.087
No harm comes to him.

28:27.155 --> 28:29.390
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

28:30.392 --> 28:35.296
His blood runs in my veins.

28:35.363 --> 28:39.733
You do not kill him,
I go with you.

28:41.336 --> 28:43.870
<i>Vamos.</i>

28:50.747 --> 28:53.549
BECKMAN:
Your task is to sneak back
into Costa Gravas,

28:53.617 --> 28:56.419
destroy the nuclear control
room, and find the missiles.

28:56.487 --> 28:58.588
The U.S. wants
the Generalissimo back in charge

28:58.656 --> 29:00.824
but without
nuclear capabilities.

29:00.892 --> 29:02.159
On it, General.

29:02.226 --> 29:04.662
I know every corner of that
godforsaken slime hole.

29:04.729 --> 29:07.631
Colonel Casey, are you certain
you're up for a mission?

29:07.699 --> 29:10.098
He seems to be
pretty determined.
I think he is.

29:10.164 --> 29:12.165
(beeping)

29:15.103 --> 29:17.037
CHUCK (coughs):
Casey.

29:17.105 --> 29:19.340
You could have told me
that when you said

29:19.408 --> 29:21.776
this place was
a "godforsaken slime hole,"

29:21.843 --> 29:24.011
you were speaking
literally.

29:24.079 --> 29:25.379
Ugh.

29:25.447 --> 29:27.548
SARAH:
We're almost
to the control room.

29:27.616 --> 29:29.049
Yeah.
(coughs)

29:29.117 --> 29:30.985
We'll place the charges
around it.

29:31.053 --> 29:33.320
That way, if we have to, we can
obliterate the whole thing.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.824
(groans)

29:36.891 --> 29:38.826
Oh, what is that smell?

29:38.893 --> 29:41.861
That is the stench
of tyranny.

29:51.372 --> 29:53.706
Oh.

29:53.773 --> 29:56.342
Dr. Fred.

29:56.409 --> 29:59.411
Wow, big fan,
really just a big fan.

29:59.479 --> 30:01.680
Listen, I-I met
someone recently,

30:01.748 --> 30:03.782
and it is of life-or-death
importance

30:03.850 --> 30:06.886
that I make absolutely certain
that she is The One.

30:06.953 --> 30:10.990
<i>Actually, that is the topic
of my next book How to Know--</i>

30:11.058 --> 30:13.426
250 pages of exercises
guiding you

30:13.494 --> 30:15.861
through a revolutionary
40-step process.

30:15.929 --> 30:17.229
(whistles)
40 steps, huh?

30:17.297 --> 30:19.498
Yeah, that's a lot of detail,
you know, but I just...

30:19.566 --> 30:20.733
Excuse me.

30:20.801 --> 30:25.437
Son, are you going
to another man for love advice?

30:25.505 --> 30:27.039
Have I not made
your mama Bolonia

30:27.107 --> 30:29.275
sing like the happiest
bird in the sky?

30:29.342 --> 30:31.310
Probably, sir, sure.

30:31.377 --> 30:32.411
Listen, here's the thing--

30:32.478 --> 30:34.079
this guy wrote the book
on it, literally.

30:34.147 --> 30:36.215
Boy, when has
anyone ever learned

30:36.283 --> 30:38.184
anything important
from a book?

30:38.251 --> 30:39.952
You got to take
your woman,

30:40.020 --> 30:42.521
kiss her on the lips,
and see what happens.

30:42.589 --> 30:45.290
If you hear
sweet, smooth jams

30:45.358 --> 30:49.794
rise up from your soul,
then that's your answer.

30:54.501 --> 30:58.905
I've never, ever heard
smooth jams.

30:58.973 --> 31:01.341
The former head of our people
became a puppet

31:01.409 --> 31:04.711
for the Americans and was
getting fat off our land.

31:04.778 --> 31:08.314
I think I've stayed very fit
over the years, actually.

31:08.382 --> 31:10.582
Shut up, Alejandro, you've
ruined seven takes already.

31:10.650 --> 31:11.883
Oh, I'm sorry,
darling.

31:11.951 --> 31:14.385
I just wish I knew why
you were so angry with me.

31:14.453 --> 31:17.054
Why?

31:17.122 --> 31:19.758
HORTENCIA:
I have been telling you for
years that I was unhappy.

31:19.826 --> 31:22.228
But would you
work on it?

31:22.296 --> 31:24.130
<i>Would you go see
someone with me?
Amor,</i>

31:24.198 --> 31:26.365
what kind of rebel leader
goes to a marriage counselor?

31:26.433 --> 31:27.567
It's ridiculous.

31:27.634 --> 31:29.635
TURRINI:
Hortencia.

31:33.673 --> 31:37.410
HORTENCIA:
For any who might want to
remove the people from office,

31:46.453 --> 31:48.520

33:34.159 --> 33:37.027
You two clearly still care
about each other.

You could have killed
the Generalissimo at any point,

33:38.763 --> 33:40.631
and you haven't done it.
What is happening?!

33:40.699 --> 33:41.732
Hortencia,

33:41.800 --> 33:42.933

33:47.205 --> 33:50.040

when you started out,

33:50.108 --> 33:51.575
just the two of you
crazy kids

33:51.643 --> 33:53.210
cuddled up in your little
tropical cave,

33:53.277 --> 33:56.813
dreaming of revolution, and
having sweet, sweet jungle love,

33:56.881 --> 33:59.583
everything was perfect, no?

33:59.651 --> 34:02.219
But then we moved
into the palace,

34:02.287 --> 34:04.254
and he changed.

34:04.322 --> 34:07.490
So change ruined things?

34:09.460 --> 34:10.893
But change is unavoidable.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.730
Unavoidable.
Life is full of changes.

34:13.797 --> 34:16.264
Constantly changing,
and the question is,

34:16.333 --> 34:19.168
no matter what the changes are,

34:19.235 --> 34:22.271
is the love still there?

34:26.678 --> 34:27.811
Fine.

34:27.879 --> 34:29.512

We were, we were talking
about change.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.342
The fact is
we were partners...

34:57.410 --> 34:59.444
comrades.

34:59.512 --> 35:04.449
And then he stopped
listening to me.

35:04.517 --> 35:05.650
No, I listened.

35:05.718 --> 35:06.651
No, it was different
