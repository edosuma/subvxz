[narrator]
<i>Few know the whole story.</i>

00:58.640 --> 01:02.269
<i>From what I recall,
it goes something like this...</i>

01:02.800 --> 01:04.791
<i>Before history began,</i>

01:04.879 --> 01:07.758
<i>Egypt was the birthplace of all life.</i>

01:07.880 --> 01:11.350
<i>A paradise worthy of the gods
who created it.</i>

01:11.440 --> 01:13.670
<i>So the gods
decided to live there</i>

01:13.800 --> 01:16.553
<i>alongside their
lesser creation, man.</i>

01:17.760 --> 01:21.309
<i>But there was no mistaking the gods
amongst the mortals who worshipped them.</i>

01:21.400 --> 01:25.791
<i>The gods were taller with gold running
through their veins instead of blood.</i>

01:27.440 --> 01:31.228
<i>And they could transform at will
into all manner of frightening beasts.</i>

01:34.680 --> 01:38.468
<i>Egypt itself was divided
between two mighty brothers.</i>

01:38.560 --> 01:41.757
<i>Osiris, the God of Life,
was the beloved king</i>

01:41.840 --> 01:43.876
<i>of all the lands
made bountiful by the Nile.</i>

01:45.600 --> 01:49.513
<i>His brother, Set,
ruled the far barren desert</i>

01:49.600 --> 01:54.116
<i>finding both strength
and bitterness in his isolation.</i>

01:54.200 --> 01:57.431
<i>But then the time came
for Osiris to crown a new king.</i>

01:57.520 --> 02:00.478
<i>His only son, Horus.</i>

02:00.560 --> 02:02.915
<i>It was a decision that would
test the brothers' bond</i>

02:03.000 --> 02:05.230
<i>and the fate of all Egypt.</i>

02:25.160 --> 02:27.310
<i>But the gods are only half our tale.</i>

02:27.800 --> 02:31.998
<i>It had become clear that they couldn't
shape the course of destiny alone.</i>

02:32.080 --> 02:37.074
<i>A man of exceptional judgment,
wisdom and fortitude would be needed.</i>

02:37.160 --> 02:41.073
<i>Unfortunately, I was not such a man.</i>

02:41.160 --> 02:45.358
<i>But before you dismiss
my younger foolhardy self, remember...</i>

02:46.680 --> 02:51.037
<i>Never doubt a man fighting for the one
thing as powerful as any god.</i>

02:51.120 --> 02:52.553
[man]
Three hundred, impossible.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.640
[narrator] <i>Love.</i>

02:56.880 --> 02:58.438
[grunts] Thief!

02:58.520 --> 02:59.953
[grunting]

03:00.040 --> 03:01.553
[man] Stop!

03:04.400 --> 03:08.154
[sighs] This dress is hopeless.
I need to buy some ribbon to even begin

03:08.240 --> 03:10.435
to make it suitable
for the coronation.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.670
I say we spend tomorrow
together instead.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.752
We are spending tomorrow together.
At the coronation.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.110
We're blessed the gods shall give us
a new king in our lifetime.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.519
Horus?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.397
You know I couldn't care less
about the gods.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.879
Well, they care about you.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.918
- Oh, yeah?
- Bek! Give it back.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.156
I knew you wanted
to wear something special.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.557
Did you steal it from a shopkeeper
or from someone's closet?

03:36.640 --> 03:39.518
It was quicker than waiting
for the gods to answer my prayers.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.556
The gods give us
everything we need.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.712
Yes. Their generosity knows no bounds.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.911
[sighs] You look beautiful.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.755
Zaya, when I asked you
to run away with me,

03:53.840 --> 03:55.671
I promised you a good life.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.878
Dresses worthy of a princess.
A new one every day.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.916
- [chuckles]
- Rivers of jewels to adorn you.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.993
- A golden palace to raise our family.
- And how many children would we have?

04:05.440 --> 04:06.440
[chuckles]

04:06.520 --> 04:07.748
[softly] A dozen.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.795
I would do anything
to make you happy.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.953
[Older Bek] <i>And how was Horus, the
king-to-be, preparing for his great day?</i>

04:15.040 --> 04:16.358
[snoring]

04:20.600 --> 04:22.795
Lord of the Air.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.156
Quite an occasion last night.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.993
Already crowds press cheek-to-cheek
to catch a glimpse of you.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.314
[servant 2]
You will look splendid.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.628
[grunting softly]

04:31.720 --> 04:33.676
- Eventually.
- [giggling]

04:37.240 --> 04:40.038
♪ Glorious, glorious Horus! ♪

04:40.120 --> 04:42.634
[Older Bek] <i>But don't discount
Horus yet either.</i>

04:42.760 --> 04:46.389
<i>Because when it comes to the fate
of the world in one's hands,</i>

04:46.480 --> 04:49.472
<i>even gods can be surprised
by the strength they possess.</i>

04:49.600 --> 04:51.272
[sighs]

04:55.640 --> 04:59.394
If I was to be crowned,
I might have spent the preceding hours

04:59.480 --> 05:01.038
composing a message for my people.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.917
Could the people love him more?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.560
Maybe Lord Horus doesn't think
we need boring speeches.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.596
Except when it comes
to toasting his own glory.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.750
Many toasts were required.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.115
I was doing deeds
of which songs will be sung.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.555
The great lion he slayed
was terrorizing villages.

05:14.640 --> 05:18.110
It was? Good.
All the more song-worthy.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.553
[sighs]

05:19.640 --> 05:21.232
That's nice.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.992
[stutters]
That's fine, thank...

05:26.680 --> 05:27.874
You.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.349
A shame I've come too late.

05:30.440 --> 05:35.036
But here I am, sober and clothed.
Don't tell anyone.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.475
I have a bad reputation to keep.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.156
[softly] Come here. Come.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.389
No. No, no. No, no!

05:41.480 --> 05:42.549
[screams]

05:42.640 --> 05:43.709
[gasps]

05:50.640 --> 05:53.757
Hard to believe,
but you look like a king.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.990
If that's what excites you,
who am I to judge?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.479
Jewelry excites me.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.314
Then look to your wrist,
if the effort is not too great.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.869
The Bracelet of 42 Stars.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.428
T o remind you of the demons
I slayed for you.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.795
A more valuable treasure
Egypt has never known.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.313
This old thing?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.994
How can the Goddess of Love
not know what love is?

06:12.080 --> 06:17.074
It's not bedding any girl who flutters
her eyelashes, mighty lion-slayer.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.391
I was celebrating the hunt.
You would know that had you been here.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.517
I value my freedom.
Dead animals less so.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.158
Well, you have no
problem wearing them.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.231
- Oh...
- Hathor, don't.

06:27.640 --> 06:28.755
Don't.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.998
That's no way for
a queen to behave.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.469
Then it's a good thing
I'm not a queen.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.552
Can you imagine anything more dull
than sitting on a throne all day?

06:40.640 --> 06:42.756
What exactly are you asking me?

06:43.960 --> 06:45.109
Did I ask you something?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.393
I'm not sure. Did you?

06:53.360 --> 06:54.395
[servant] My Lord.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.229
It's starting.

07:06.720 --> 07:07.869
[sighs]

07:15.320 --> 07:16.389
[drums beating]

07:19.720 --> 07:21.950
[crowd cheering]

07:46.760 --> 07:51.117
Hathor, Goddess of Love!

07:51.560 --> 07:53.437
[crowd applauding]

08:04.880 --> 08:09.908
Nephthys, Goddess of Protection!

08:15.280 --> 08:16.315
[grunts]

08:17.240 --> 08:18.719
- Sir.
- Oh...

08:18.800 --> 08:20.995
Thank you, young man.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.073
You've been awfully nice to
strangers today. Show me your hands.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.434
- What? Gifts for Osiris.
- [Zaya] Hurry up!

08:31.440 --> 08:35.227
Thoth, God of Wisdom!

08:40.280 --> 08:42.157
Greetings, Thoth.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.390
Did you ever imagine
that your former student

08:44.480 --> 08:46.471
would one day wear
the crown of Egypt?

08:47.320 --> 08:50.232
Horus evinced a range of attributes,

08:50.320 --> 08:53.118
some of which may well correlate
with a leadership position.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.430
If he's lucky.

08:55.520 --> 08:56.919
[trumpets blowing]

08:57.000 --> 09:00.709
Praise Osiris!

09:01.280 --> 09:02.395
[crowd cheering]

09:02.520 --> 09:06.274
King of all Egypt!

09:07.680 --> 09:10.592
Hail Ra, Lord of Light.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.559
[all] Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

09:14.640 --> 09:17.757
My father has seen
fit to bless this day

09:18.680 --> 09:22.150
as you all bless us
with your generosity.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.388
A token from someone with much.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.278
And from someone with little.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.910
But when both die
and stand at the Final Gate,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.230
what is their value then?

09:41.320 --> 09:46.758
I say they are equal.
Symbols of lives well-lived.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.196
All are welcome to the Afterlife.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.911
This is my legacy.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.558
But today, we crown a new king.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.552
And one day, he will have
a legacy of his own.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.837
My son Horus, Lord of the Air.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.309
[crowd roaring and applauding]

10:18.880 --> 10:20.029
[whispering]
Are you ready?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.229
I am.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.549
[Set] Wait!

10:29.000 --> 10:32.197
Wait. Sorry, I'm late.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.113
Ugh, three days to cross the desert.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.760
And nearly one more to pass
through all your admirers.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.114
[crowd laughing]

10:39.720 --> 10:40.994
Set!

10:41.080 --> 10:44.834
- Brother. Good to see you.
- And you, brother.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.831
There's always
a place for you here.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.833
Such a big day for the family.
You must be proud.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.593
I am.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.717
Look at you, nephew. Magnificent.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.796
At least someone
here'll make a fine king.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.838
- I was afraid you wouldn't come.
- No, I wouldn't miss it.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.114
Ah.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.950
- For you.
- Oh...

11:05.920 --> 11:07.751
A hunting horn.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.629
From the skull of a ram that flattened
ten gods slower than me.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.948
It's beautiful.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.837
Yeah? Try it out.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.228
From Set.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.673
[crowd cheering]

11:22.640 --> 11:25.757
Come on!
Let Ra himself hear you.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.836
- [blows horn]
- [cheering]

11:35.320 --> 11:36.833
[man shouting]

11:36.920 --> 11:38.990
I think someone heard you.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.116
[footsteps marching]

12:02.920 --> 12:04.273
What is this, Set?

12:07.840 --> 12:09.592
[soldier shouting]

12:12.440 --> 12:14.032
- [soldiers shouting]
- [crowd gasps]

12:15.600 --> 12:17.192
You recognize it?

12:20.680 --> 12:22.352
Father gave it to you.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.952
Kept me alive for many
a night in the desert.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.638
Fight me.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.790
- Father, don't.
- Stay out of this, son.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.068
Why?

12:36.160 --> 12:40.358
In 1,000 years of peace,
what have you accomplished?

12:40.440 --> 12:43.671
A land of people
who dream of nothing more.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.832
- It's my turn now.
- I won't fight.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.749
I love you, brother.
With all my heart.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.436
[all gasp]

12:54.600 --> 12:56.158
I love you, too, brother.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.274
No!

13:00.680 --> 13:02.193
Osiris!

13:06.400 --> 13:10.598
Well, this truly is
a big day for the family.

13:11.880 --> 13:17.637
I, Set...
shall be your one true king.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.668
King of all Egypt!

13:20.920 --> 13:23.912
Behold the fate
of those who stand in my way.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.548
Gods...

13:28.360 --> 13:30.874
Bow before me or die.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.237
Mortals, worship me
or be enslaved!

13:42.320 --> 13:44.117
[crowd murmuring]

13:45.320 --> 13:46.514
[softly] Bek!

13:46.600 --> 13:49.876
My brother thought
the Afterlife was a gift.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.355
I think a king should
have higher standards.

13:54.760 --> 13:58.355
From now on, you have to buy your way
in with riches earned.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.479
[breathing shakily]

14:03.560 --> 14:06.552
Your journey has just begun.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.915
- [gasping]
- [sobbing]

14:17.080 --> 14:18.479
[crying]

14:23.280 --> 14:24.998
It's yours now.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.668
Many of us will stand with you,
but now is not the time.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.356
- I looked up to you.
- Of course you did.

14:36.840 --> 14:37.989
[grunting]

14:38.920 --> 14:40.512
That would be unwise.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.437
Is it true you still never miss?
Doesn't that get dull?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.356
- [crowd gasps]
- [Set laughs]

14:54.440 --> 14:56.192
I thought your sight was perfect.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.833
[grunts]

15:15.800 --> 15:17.677
[both grunting]

15:22.280 --> 15:24.953
You fight well.
Are you so sure you're his son?

15:35.840 --> 15:37.193
[inhales sharply]

15:38.720 --> 15:40.153
[grunting]

15:43.920 --> 15:45.399
[grunting]

15:47.560 --> 15:48.834
[roaring]

15:54.280 --> 15:55.793
[crowd screaming]

16:13.360 --> 16:14.793
[Set roars]

16:24.840 --> 16:26.114
Zaya!

16:27.000 --> 16:28.956
- Bek!
- Zaya!

16:29.040 --> 16:30.075
Bek!

16:30.360 --> 16:32.157
[grunts]

16:33.000 --> 16:34.399
[soldiers shout]

16:34.800 --> 16:36.233
[Horus grunts]

17:01.320 --> 17:04.550
I'm doing Egypt a favor.
You're not fit to be King.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.239
[groaning]

17:11.319 --> 17:12.513
[Horus continues groaning]

17:16.200 --> 17:18.430
[screaming] No!

17:19.119 --> 17:20.119
No!

17:26.040 --> 17:27.233
[Horus groaning]

17:32.560 --> 17:34.073
[crying]

17:37.480 --> 17:38.480
Set!

17:54.960 --> 17:56.552
[softly] Forgive me, Father.

17:58.480 --> 17:59.959
[soldiers shouting]

18:02.560 --> 18:03.913
[growls]

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
[Bek] Zaya!

18:05.680 --> 18:07.079
Zaya!

18:13.600 --> 18:16.319
[Older Bek]
<i>And so Set was King.</i>

18:17.040 --> 18:20.510
<i>In the year that followed,
many gods stood against him.</i>

18:20.600 --> 18:24.479
<i>One by one,
they paid with their lives.</i>

18:24.560 --> 18:26.790
<i>For mortals, things were worse.</i>

18:27.720 --> 18:32.191
<i>Most were forced into slavery,
and denied even the tiniest penny</i>

18:32.280 --> 18:35.033
<i>to buy our way into the Afterlife.</i>

18:35.120 --> 18:39.318
<i>Blinded and defeated,
Horus withdrew into exile.</i>

18:39.400 --> 18:43.234
<i>Those who prayed for him to save Egypt
were sorely disappointed.</i>

18:43.880 --> 18:46.758
<i>But I was never much for prayer.</i>

18:46.840 --> 18:49.673
<i>I had found Zaya
enslaved to a cruel master.</i>

18:50.960 --> 18:53.952
<i>But how could I free her from all this?</i>

18:54.040 --> 18:56.679
<i>It was the maddest of all plans.</i>

19:09.080 --> 19:12.516
You may not control the wind, Zaya,
but I'd think you could close a shutter.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.869
Sorry, My Lord.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.071
Pretty one, if ever I find
my desk disordered again,

19:21.160 --> 19:24.311
I'll throw you outside to push stone.
Is that clear?

19:29.880 --> 19:31.836
Come on, come on!
Haven't got all day.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.591
I'd like to drop him
from a great height.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.272
- [chuckles]
- Morning.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.518
- [whiplash]
- [horse whinnying]

19:42.600 --> 19:44.716
One day, I'm going to steal
you away from him.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.074
Is theft always the answer?

19:46.160 --> 19:48.799
It is now in this world.
You're either rich or nothing.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.029
[chuckles softly]

19:50.600 --> 19:54.798
Even if you could free me,
what about my family? Our friends?

19:54.920 --> 19:57.115
Can you steal all Egypt
away from Set?

19:57.200 --> 19:59.395
- [scoffs]
- Only Horus can free us.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.313
- You really believe the gods care?
- If Horus could come, he would.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.794
I want to show you something.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.674
Set's army returns with spoils of war.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.318
His vault will be unlocked tonight.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.834
The perfect time
for someone to sneak inside.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.717
Why?

20:21.800 --> 20:23.677
They say Horus' eyes
are kept there.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.193
He would have his power again.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.474
Steal from a god?

20:26.560 --> 20:29.199
Only a madman would try such a thing.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.555
Where do you suppose
we could find someone so mad?

20:33.040 --> 20:34.632
The plans should be here.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.188
Urshu built the vault.
He's Set's architect.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.634
What's this?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.915
Uh, Set's pyramid of sand.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.391
[Bek] He's built himself
quite the fire pit.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.311
He must cook massive feasts.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.356
It's the pit to the center
of the world.

20:49.440 --> 20:52.318
The source of his power. No feasts.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.914
Found it.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.035
The treasure will pass
through the front gate.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.235
The front gate
isn't the problem.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.032
It's what comes after.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.874
Two bridges rigged with traps.
Urshu boasts of them endlessly.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.314
Good thing I'm cheating.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.958
Welcome me properly, soldier.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.794
Don't keep
the Queen of Egypt waiting.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.675
- [Set] <i>I think you missed me.</i>
- [chuckles]

21:43.760 --> 21:47.639
I have to miss you.
I'm your prisoner, after all.

21:47.720 --> 21:51.269
- Oh, this prison's not so bad.
- Well, I'm miserable.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.318
You have a funny way of showing it.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.755
Can I borrow your knife?

21:56.840 --> 22:01.277
So if you had the chance, you'd kill me?

22:01.720 --> 22:03.312
How could I kill you?

22:04.640 --> 22:06.278
But you would if you could.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.236
[whispering]
Better keep your eyes open.

22:19.480 --> 22:20.674
Lord Set.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.434
- [laughs]
- Oh...

22:22.640 --> 22:24.756
And, uh... Mistress.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.516
Perhaps I might
come at a better time.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.318
[Set]
No, come in. Don't be shy.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.918
[Set exhales]

22:33.280 --> 22:34.280
Come on.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.359
No one has ever so honored
the great God Ra.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.829
He will pass
over its peak and marvel

22:48.920 --> 22:50.956
at the tribute you have
built in his name.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.991
Is that it?

22:54.080 --> 22:55.080
I'm sorry?

22:56.120 --> 22:58.190
Well, can you make it any taller?

22:59.280 --> 23:03.114
- Taller?
- Yes, it's a simple question.

23:03.720 --> 23:07.793
Well, that might be difficult, um,
now, I mean...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.434
Relax, Urshu. I'm joking.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.275
[laughs]

23:13.240 --> 23:18.439
Tell me, why'd your father
choose you to be master builder

23:18.520 --> 23:20.750
rather than one of your brothers?

23:20.840 --> 23:22.990
I suppose because I proved
to be the best, My Lord.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.913
As I shall prove
to be the best to my father.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.876
He shall see it from dawn to dusk.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.951
Your satisfaction
is worth more than gold.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.837
Oh, gold, gold!

23:34.920 --> 23:36.840
You'll have plenty enough
gold for the Afterlife.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.154
A toast!

23:39.240 --> 23:41.231
To Egypt's greatest builder.

23:42.760 --> 23:46.309
A toast to my legacy.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.239
[elephants trumpet]

24:01.880 --> 24:02.995
[grunts]

24:40.320 --> 24:41.799
[Bek screams]

24:43.080 --> 24:45.036
Whoa!

24:45.120 --> 24:46.314
[grunts]

25:01.000 --> 25:02.433
[chittering]

25:03.760 --> 25:04.875
[grunts]

25:06.280 --> 25:08.350
Where do you even
get that many scorpions?

25:43.920 --> 25:46.036
Enough to make you afraid
of your own shadow.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.875
"The circle is the trigger."

26:20.400 --> 26:21.833
So I'll go 'round.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.951
Well, that was easy.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.754
[rattling]

26:55.080 --> 26:56.433
[breathing shakily]

26:58.960 --> 27:00.473
[panting]

27:04.240 --> 27:05.878
A third bridge.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.720
Doesn't say anything about
a third bridge.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.392
This is criminal.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.119
And only one eye.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.677
Terrific.

27:23.760 --> 27:27.435
Zaya, you'd say a prayer,
I'll roll the bones.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.235
[rattling]

27:38.560 --> 27:40.278
[yells]

27:47.960 --> 27:48.995
[chittering]

27:49.720 --> 27:50.914
[gasps]

27:57.800 --> 27:58.949
[chuckles]

28:07.440 --> 28:08.475
Zaya!

28:10.600 --> 28:12.272
[whispering] I'm so sorry.

28:15.120 --> 28:19.591
As if using my house for your
fornicating were not sufficient...

28:23.840 --> 28:25.671
You dare steal from the King?

28:32.160 --> 28:35.596
I pride myself
in an orderly office, Zaya.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.556
You never did
understand that, did you?

28:38.640 --> 28:41.996
Oh, and this pathetic little
trinket of yours

28:42.080 --> 28:43.798
will save neither of you, I'm afraid.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.359
[softly] Set is your god.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.998
- It was all my idea.
- Liar!

28:52.880 --> 28:54.518
Give me back what you took.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.115
Thank you.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.390
- Feed them to the jackals.
- Wait!

29:07.640 --> 29:09.278
[breathing heavily]

29:09.400 --> 29:11.868
- I took something else.
- [screams]

29:16.080 --> 29:17.798
- Run!
- [grunts]

29:24.240 --> 29:25.673
- Hee-ya!
- [horse whinnies]

29:36.240 --> 29:39.357
[chuckles] You did it.
Where's the other?

29:39.880 --> 29:41.632
You know how hard it was
to steal that one?

29:41.720 --> 29:42.835
[both laugh]

29:59.840 --> 30:01.398
[gasping]

30:01.480 --> 30:04.040
- I'll love you forever.
- Zaya.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.951
Death is not the end.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.759
Zaya.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.071
- [horses whinnying]
- Whoa.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.233
I'll make it right, Zaya.

31:15.280 --> 31:17.396
[Horus]
I don't need any more worshippers.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.399
Tributes that rot and stink.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.993
Unless you brought
more wine, get out.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.312
I'm no worshipper.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.355
What are you?
Some thief?

31:30.880 --> 31:33.155
Yes. A thief.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.351
I have something
Set took from you.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.269
[groans]

31:46.080 --> 31:48.310
No mortal could rob Set's vault.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.397
You pilfered one of my
followers' corpses.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.995
- They never even got close.
- Give them to me.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.958
- Not yet.
- Give me my eyes.

31:58.040 --> 32:01.669
- I have a proposition.
- You bargain with me?

32:01.840 --> 32:03.034
[grunting]

32:09.840 --> 32:11.558
You're lucky I'm willing to.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.471
You can't strike
a three-legged elephant.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.710
You want a reward, I suppose?
Gold?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.438
- Gold I can steal.
- [grunts]

32:35.000 --> 32:36.672
- [clattering]
- [exhales]

32:39.400 --> 32:40.958
There's someone I want saved.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.753
From what?

32:46.680 --> 32:47.908
Death.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.712
[scoffs]

32:49.800 --> 32:51.631
Didn't your father teach
that death isn't the end?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.039
It can't be done.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.240
Well, figure it out.
You're Horus, Lord of the Air!

32:56.320 --> 32:57.958
Or maybe I'll just toss
what I have in the Nile.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.149
Wait.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.948
[Horus] <i>Stay with the living.</i>

33:11.960 --> 33:13.871
Stay with the living.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.589
Stay with the living.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.908
She's gone beyond where I can reach her.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.231
- But you're a god.
- Gods may live 1,000 of your years,

33:24.320 --> 33:26.151
but we cannot cure mortality.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.752
It's time for her
to walk the path.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.829
There must be
something you can do.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.194
I've done all I can.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.236
Oh, thou who art everlasting,

33:35.320 --> 33:38.118
send your servant to guide
the dead to new life.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.478
Anubis, come forth.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.357
[wind howling]

33:59.160 --> 34:00.593
You are released.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.637
The doors of Earth
are open to you.

34:12.719 --> 34:16.599
- You must begin your journey.
- She died a slave.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.120
Without treasure, she won't be allowed
through the Final Gate.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.235
What do you offer?

34:21.320 --> 34:23.356
She can't pass into the Afterlife.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.715
For you, Lord Anubis,

34:26.800 --> 34:29.188
Governor of the Bows,
who is upon his mountain,

34:31.719 --> 34:33.790
I have only my smile.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.237
So be it.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.435
[Bek] Zaya!

34:41.199 --> 34:42.713
Zaya!

34:42.800 --> 34:44.279
The dead don't speak to the living.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.112
Stay on the path.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.354
[Horus] Now give them to me.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.950
- You've done nothing!
- My eyes.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.235
Spend the rest of your days
wandering around sightless.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.799
I have nothing to lose.
Do you understand?

35:17.880 --> 35:19.632
Give me my eyes.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.239
I will do anything to see
her again or I'll die trying.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.949
You want to hide from me?
Learn to talk less.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.318
- Here.
- [grunts]

35:30.360 --> 35:31.873
[gasps]

35:38.640 --> 35:39.868
[sighs]

35:39.960 --> 35:41.439
Where's the other?

35:41.600 --> 35:43.158
[stutters]

35:43.640 --> 35:45.358
Where's the other?

35:45.440 --> 35:47.192
Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I...

35:47.280 --> 35:48.599
I'll snap your neck.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.193
[choking]

35:50.280 --> 35:52.510
You must hate Set for what
he did to your father.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.913
The pyramid.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.831
I know how to get into
Set's pyramid.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.039
How?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.319
How?

36:05.520 --> 36:06.839
Oh...

36:07.640 --> 36:09.437
[gasping]

36:09.560 --> 36:11.312
It's where he keeps
his power locked up, right?

36:11.400 --> 36:13.789
If I could get you inside,
could you kill him?

36:14.520 --> 36:15.953
[grunts]

36:17.960 --> 36:19.518
How would you do that?

36:19.720 --> 36:22.598
- I saw the plans.
- Tell me.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.715
- I'll show you.
- Go on.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.119
If you bring Zaya back.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.313
There may be a way.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.919
[Horus] No one may leave
the Afterlife once entered.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.353
But the journey
through the Nine Gates

36:36.440 --> 36:38.271
will take several days to complete.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.355
And only the King
can make Anubis turn back.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.997
If I kill Set
and take back the crown

36:46.080 --> 36:48.435
before your beloved
reaches the Final Gate,

36:49.320 --> 36:50.833
I might be able to save her.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.828
Try to keep up.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.269
[Set]
My magnificent bloody hounds.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.430
[soldiers cheering]

37:10.520 --> 37:14.149
You are the true sons of Egypt.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.908
You are my children
of iron and blood.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.268
No father could be more proud.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.599
The rebel gods
have choked on our spears.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.280
The rest have retreated
to Nephthys' stronghold

37:27.360 --> 37:30.033
where they now stand
ready to face us.

37:30.120 --> 37:35.240
But you, my legions of the desert,
will bring them reckoning!

37:35.320 --> 37:36.992
[cheering]

37:38.400 --> 37:41.119
So take your fill of gold!
[grunts]

37:43.200 --> 37:45.998
And if you should fall in battle
and travel the Nine Gates,

37:46.080 --> 37:49.117
tell my brother
who it is you worship!

37:49.200 --> 37:53.591
[man] Division Set!
Amarn! Ta! Rai! Fall in!

37:54.520 --> 37:56.988
Forward march!

38:08.200 --> 38:09.269
My Lord.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.309
Your royal treasury
has been breached.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.439
[Set] <i>Urshu...</i>

38:18.200 --> 38:21.715
Wasn't the eye meant to lure
those loyal to Horus to their deaths?

38:22.440 --> 38:23.839
Yes, Lord.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.150
And weren't your traps...

38:27.000 --> 38:28.513
What was the term you used?

38:29.720 --> 38:31.119
Thief-proof?

38:31.760 --> 38:33.159
Yes, Lord.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.033
Can you pick up the trail?

38:35.120 --> 38:36.553
I'll find him.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.039
And find whichever of his allies

38:38.120 --> 38:41.112
was clever enough
to steal back his eye.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.393
It was a mortal, Lord.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.793
A mortal?

38:48.880 --> 38:50.154
[chuckles nervously]

38:56.280 --> 38:57.315
Who is she?

38:57.400 --> 38:58.753
His servant.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.671
In my defense, Lord...

39:00.760 --> 39:03.593
Believe me, I'm very curious
to hear what your excuse is.

39:03.680 --> 39:04.829
But not right now.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.148
Yes, Lord.

39:10.280 --> 39:14.159
Well, it appears you're not
the cleverest mortal in Egypt after all.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.559
This thief is.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.312
[Bek] So what is your plan?

39:20.400 --> 39:24.029
[Horus] To kill the God of the Desert,
we must kill the desert itself.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.078
Kill the desert?

39:26.560 --> 39:27.913
How do you kill the desert?

39:34.200 --> 39:36.111
We must go to my grandfather's.

39:36.480 --> 39:39.358
- He'll help us with our task.
- Your grandfather?

39:39.480 --> 39:41.550
You mean Ra?
The Sun God, Ra?

39:42.840 --> 39:44.671
So where exactly is your grandfather?

39:48.280 --> 39:49.838
You're being funny, right?

39:49.920 --> 39:52.229
You think I'd put any effort
into trying to amuse you?

39:52.960 --> 39:54.951
It seems flying
would be useful right now.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.951
Without both my eyes,
I cannot transform.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.479
I need to pray for strength.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.268
Oh, that's not encouraging.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.749
Be silent or you'll reach
the bottom of this mountain

40:02.840 --> 40:04.320
much quicker
than you reached the top.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.276
- [gasps]
- [wind howling]

40:23.040 --> 40:26.396
Great Ra, know my name.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.112
The Lord of the Air seeks your embrace.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.632
[whispers]
Grandfather, I need your help. Please!

40:53.760 --> 40:54.909
Impressed!

40:55.520 --> 40:56.839
[laughs]

41:20.480 --> 41:21.480
[Bek grunts]

41:28.040 --> 41:29.553
[Horus] Stay in my shadow.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.792
- Why?
- Just do as I say.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.029
- [skin sizzles]
- [groans]

41:34.960 --> 41:36.996
[Horus]
Hail, thou Great God Ra.

41:37.960 --> 41:42.351
Normally, when a bird lands on my boat,
I kill it before it can shit.

41:43.960 --> 41:47.794
What is this? You dare bring a mortal
to the source of Creation?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.075
He's valuable to me.
I could not leave him behind.

41:50.160 --> 41:53.755
Ah.
Why have you come?

41:53.840 --> 41:55.273
I would only ask
something of you.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.679
Oh, in that case,

41:56.760 --> 42:00.753
I shall stop what I'm doing
and heed your bidding.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.600
Grandfather, I'm sorry.
I mean no disrespect.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.278
You don't know the difference.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.078
[howling in the distance]

42:09.800 --> 42:12.109
Stay there. Be quiet.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.557
I have work to do.

42:33.920 --> 42:36.480
And put the mortal below deck
if you want him to live.

42:57.600 --> 42:58.874
[grunts]

43:17.480 --> 43:19.471
[growling]

43:26.240 --> 43:28.117
[groans]

43:30.000 --> 43:31.592
[grunting]

43:56.680 --> 44:00.309
Crawl back to shadow,
you stinking worm!

44:01.400 --> 44:04.995
You shall never feast
on my creation!

44:06.480 --> 44:07.913
Try as you might.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.917
Things would be different
if I could dwell

44:14.000 --> 44:16.389
amongst my children
in the garden of the Nile.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.439
It is my burden to fight
the demon Apophis night after night.

44:20.520 --> 44:23.318
Egypt must never be
destroyed by Chaos.

44:23.480 --> 44:28.031
So, you see,
there are things worse than Set.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.073
You're wrong.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.799
That demon isn't the one
who murdered my father.

44:32.880 --> 44:36.031
- Murdered your son.
- They are both my sons.

44:36.120 --> 44:39.078
They were both equal in my eyes.
As is all of my creation.

44:39.160 --> 44:42.391
And the uncertainty
of its destiny is my will.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.632
[grunts]

44:50.080 --> 44:52.958
So what is it actually
that brings you here?

44:53.920 --> 44:56.309
Allow me to fill my flask
with these waters.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.991
The waters are not mine.

45:28.800 --> 45:31.553
You plan to quench the desert fire.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.471
To kill Set.
To become King as your father wished.

45:35.560 --> 45:39.599
- Grant me the power to fly again.
- I heard your prayer the first time.

45:39.680 --> 45:42.194
I let you come here
and I grant you passage home.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.431
But after that?

45:44.520 --> 45:48.798
Without both my eyes,
I doubt I'm strong enough to beat Set.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.359
So become stronger.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.917
Have you been so lazy for so long

45:53.000 --> 45:56.072
that you've forgotten
every god's life is a journey?

45:56.160 --> 45:59.675
When you stray from your path,
you grow weak.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.432
- [pounding]
- [Bek] Hey!

46:02.200 --> 46:05.112
Why are you
lugging around this mortal?

46:05.240 --> 46:06.960
He had the gall to strike
a bargain with me.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.719
Ah.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.834
Not worth the papyrus
it's written on, hmm?

46:11.920 --> 46:14.832
[sighs] What does it matter?
He is but a mortal.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.708
I do not approve
of how Set rules.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.314
But I'm uncertain
you would be much better.

46:43.440 --> 46:47.911
Lord, the last of the rebel gods
have retreated behind her walls.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.554
Every last one?

46:50.200 --> 46:51.758
Yes, sir.

46:51.840 --> 46:54.400
Good. Then they're ripe
for the picking.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.508
Isn't this a bit excessive?

46:58.400 --> 47:00.550
She'd want them to fight
to the death anyway.

47:01.200 --> 47:04.476
- She was your wife.
- All the more reason to kill her.

47:06.160 --> 47:09.755
From now on,
this will be the way of things.

47:09.920 --> 47:11.239
Our way.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.353
Better get used to it.

47:17.720 --> 47:19.119
[soldiers shouting]

47:42.080 --> 47:43.638
[both grunting]

48:11.320 --> 48:15.154
Is it right that a goddess
should perform such labor?

48:15.600 --> 48:20.310
Since you became King, the need
for burial shrouds has been great.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.118
- You could have been a queen.
- You should know why I could not.

48:27.040 --> 48:31.955
[Set] Then, when I asked you
to marry me, why did you say yes?

48:32.040 --> 48:34.634
I remember when you
rode out of the desert.

48:35.360 --> 48:39.353
Impetuous. Dashing. So handsome.

48:40.120 --> 48:43.271
I braved those stinging winds
just to be at your side.

48:43.560 --> 48:46.711
And imagined the great deeds
we would accomplish together.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.597
It didn't all sting.

48:50.040 --> 48:54.716
- Some parts were sweet.
- Perhaps.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.189
I still thought
we could have been happy.

48:58.080 --> 49:00.036
I should have been enough
to fulfill you.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.599
[exhales]

49:03.520 --> 49:05.670
Nothing can fulfill me.

49:09.040 --> 49:13.397
That's why Ra was wise to ensure
you would never have a child.

49:17.240 --> 49:18.389
[groans]

49:23.400 --> 49:24.628
[grunts]

49:34.040 --> 49:36.349
Why?

49:36.440 --> 49:39.318
No one will know, until it's too late.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.152
[screams]

49:53.480 --> 49:54.913
[Bek screams]

49:56.480 --> 49:57.799
[Horus growls]

49:57.880 --> 49:59.108
[both grunt]

50:02.080 --> 50:03.195
[spits]

50:03.800 --> 50:06.439
Maybe next time, keep flying
until we're actually on the ground.

50:06.640 --> 50:09.074
What Ra gave, he took back.

50:09.160 --> 50:11.355
[both groan]

50:11.440 --> 50:14.318
- I thought he was helping you.
- I got what I needed.

50:15.440 --> 50:18.432
The whole of the Nile
cannot quench Set's fire.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.875
But a few drops from
the water of Creation can.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.598
Kill the desert.

50:22.680 --> 50:25.399
With his fire gone,
Set will be weakened.

50:25.480 --> 50:26.708
Vulnerable.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.392
What would happen if I drank that?

50:29.360 --> 50:33.035
You would be refreshed.
Then you would die.

50:33.120 --> 50:36.396
It doesn't seem right that the water
of Creation would kill.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.153
I would kill you.
For wasting my water.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.956
What's this?

50:43.040 --> 50:45.952
So you don't have to bring me something
to drink cupped in your hands.

50:46.520 --> 50:48.351
I'm not your slave.

50:48.480 --> 50:51.916
My father taught me it's unworthy
of a god to strike a man.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.833
He should have taught you to get off
your ass and get your own water.

50:56.960 --> 50:58.075
[grunts]

50:59.800 --> 51:01.313
Sorry, Father.

51:16.120 --> 51:17.235
[growling]

51:17.320 --> 51:18.320
[Bek yells]

51:19.520 --> 51:21.431
This is becoming unacceptable.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.152
Where is the Eye of Horus?

51:29.240 --> 51:32.118
Up your behind, alongside the goats
you keep up there.

51:33.720 --> 51:36.439
Where is the Eye of Horus?

51:37.160 --> 51:38.639
Right here.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.119
[scoffs]

51:40.240 --> 51:43.596
I thought you were crawling
sightless in the mud somewhere.

51:44.160 --> 51:45.878
Cut him down!

51:46.080 --> 51:47.718
[grunting]

51:50.960 --> 51:52.552
- [yelling]
- [groaning]

51:56.840 --> 51:58.034
[groans]

51:58.120 --> 52:01.590
See, brothers?
Without his other eye, he is weak.

52:01.720 --> 52:02.914
- [growling]
- [grunts]

52:10.600 --> 52:12.795
- [groans]
- [roaring]

52:36.680 --> 52:37.999
[yells]

52:47.080 --> 52:48.274
[Bek screams]

52:50.920 --> 52:56.677
Even if I were blind, deaf,
bereft of limbs...

52:58.720 --> 53:00.312
You're still no match for me.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.755
You'll be glad to know
I didn't fall to my death.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.159
Praise Ra.

53:10.240 --> 53:11.559
The deal doesn't count if I die.

53:11.640 --> 53:14.393
The whole point is for Zaya
and I both to be here, together.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.629
Breathing!

53:16.560 --> 53:17.675
Behind you!

53:27.000 --> 53:28.194
[Bek] Horus!

53:28.280 --> 53:29.474
Horus!

53:32.840 --> 53:34.273
[Bek exclaiming]

53:36.600 --> 53:38.955
Oh, Ra, dear Ra, please, help us!

53:39.040 --> 53:40.712
[screaming]

53:40.800 --> 53:42.358
Horus!

53:43.480 --> 53:45.357
We are going to die!

53:52.600 --> 53:53.635
[grunts]

53:57.920 --> 53:59.353
[breathing heavily]

54:01.520 --> 54:03.158
[Horus] After you.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.989
[both grunt]

54:10.720 --> 54:12.073
[pants]

54:14.160 --> 54:17.277
- Are you sure you can do this?
- I saved you, didn't I?

54:17.360 --> 54:19.828
- Oh, you saved me?
- Only because you're useful to me.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.832
You know what would be useful?
Your other eye.

54:23.080 --> 54:24.513
I could steal it back for you,
if you like.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.033
Don't test my patience, mortal.

54:26.320 --> 54:27.719
My name is not "mortal."

54:30.120 --> 54:31.519
What is it, then?

54:31.840 --> 54:32.955
Bek.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.716
Very well, Bek.

54:35.800 --> 54:37.472
The roads will be watched now.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.232
Set will send better hunters.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.879
Well, that didn't go
according to plan, did it?

54:53.960 --> 54:55.996
No, Lord.

54:56.080 --> 54:59.152
My nephew did all this
with one eye?

54:59.240 --> 55:02.676
- I underestimated his strength.
- Tough to kill, that boy.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.433
Like his uncle.

55:06.120 --> 55:09.032
Where's he going?
Who's he allying with?

55:09.120 --> 55:12.635
- His only ally is the mortal.
- It's hardly an army, is it?

55:12.720 --> 55:14.073
I overheard them.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.754
The mortal spoke of a bargain
he'd made with Horus.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.600
This is one ambitious mortal.

55:19.680 --> 55:23.719
Horus has agreed to bring the mortal's
woman back from death.

55:24.720 --> 55:26.039
Are you sure?

55:26.120 --> 55:27.872
I'm certain of it, Lord.

55:27.960 --> 55:29.109
[grunts]

55:32.160 --> 55:33.991
You should really get that attended to.

55:34.080 --> 55:37.356
- Yes, Lord. Thank you.
- Good job.

55:38.760 --> 55:39.875
[grunts]

55:43.640 --> 55:46.438
You should have trusted us
with this from the start.

55:46.520 --> 55:48.750
Haven't we always left you satisfied?

55:50.760 --> 55:52.671
Then satisfy me again.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.353
Did you let your wife live?

56:04.480 --> 56:09.031
Sooner or later, you and I
will end up just the same.

56:20.320 --> 56:22.993
The Land of the Dead
and its Nine Gates.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.798
Is it accurate,
Mistress of the West?

56:26.880 --> 56:30.395
Don't call me that.
I left all that behind.

56:30.480 --> 56:32.835
Soon, I will rule all the world.

56:32.960 --> 56:36.794
The Land of the Dead
is the final kingdom left standing.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.757
You want things you can't have.

56:40.880 --> 56:43.678
- I want you to take me there.
- But you're a living soul.

56:43.760 --> 56:47.673
Yes. And you were a living soul, too,
when you were counselor to the dead.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.480
You know what's waiting
for me if I go back.

56:49.520 --> 56:53.513
You have your little bracelet
to protect you from those demons.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.158
It's not that.

56:55.920 --> 56:59.037
[whispering]
You miss it. Don't you?

56:59.840 --> 57:02.559
The darkness.
What it brought out in you.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.153
[whispers] No.

57:04.240 --> 57:08.119
Ah, you're not so good,
Goddess of Love.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.592
- I know.
- Then do this.

57:11.680 --> 57:16.196
Prove your loyalty to me.
Then we can have everything.

57:16.680 --> 57:18.113
Together.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.273
[softly] Horus...

57:28.640 --> 57:30.198
My love.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.957
[Hathor] <i>Horus...</i>

57:43.840 --> 57:45.910
You're not in your father's tomb?

57:49.240 --> 57:51.117
- I was wondering where he was.
- [gasps]

57:52.080 --> 57:55.277
Now I know. Thanks.

57:57.440 --> 58:01.638
For someone who bends
the will of men by batting her lashes,

58:01.720 --> 58:03.153
you're not very clever.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.039
- How long has he had his sight?
- Why do you care?

58:08.120 --> 58:09.519
[scoffs]

58:10.880 --> 58:15.078
I'm yours now.
I'll do as you've asked.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.476
Even if I kill Horus?

58:18.480 --> 58:20.311
[whispering] Of course.

58:20.400 --> 58:22.755
Who cares about him?

58:25.120 --> 58:28.749
I'd have thought you'd be exhausted
from so much lying.

58:38.080 --> 58:42.119
I loved Nephthys once,
and I took her wings.

58:42.520 --> 58:44.272
Imagine what I'll do to you.

58:46.760 --> 58:48.716
Do that and I'll hunt you down.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.275
[Set grunts]

58:51.360 --> 58:53.316
[screaming]

58:56.800 --> 58:58.028
[Hathor grunts]

58:58.120 --> 58:59.633
[female demon] Let me touch.

59:00.520 --> 59:02.158
- [demon laughing]
- [Hathor groans]

59:10.800 --> 59:12.279
[groans]

59:12.400 --> 59:13.913
[breathing heavily]

59:14.000 --> 59:15.956
I suppose it's better than running.

59:16.200 --> 59:19.397
[panting]

59:25.520 --> 59:26.919
[groaning softly]

59:34.400 --> 59:35.594
[Bek grunts softly]

59:47.960 --> 59:50.918
Can we find a less unpleasant
campsite next time?

59:51.720 --> 59:52.869
Hmm.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.309
This used to be a garden
like you've never seen.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.913
What happened?

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.348
It was my father's first temple.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.112
In his generosity,
he opened the grounds

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.111
so the poor could bury
their own here.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.874
Set has corrupted his teachings.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.510
My father loved this place.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.030
So Set brought him here to be butchered.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.312
His body was cut into 14 pieces.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.799
The heart was never found.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.396
- Set salted the earth?
- No. It was my mother's tears.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.397
Before she took her own life.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.072
I failed them.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.113
I'm sorry.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.192
Ra told me I was on a journey.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.718
And if I reach the end,
I will be mighty again.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.632
- How does it end?
- With vengeance.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.115
Ends with my spear
through Set's skull.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.997
[rumbling in the distance]

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.718
Is that a storm?

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.471
There's no clouds.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.354
[growling]

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.715
Set's hunters riding their pets.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.678
Those aren't pets. A cat is a pet.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.069
I can't withstand their venom.
Not as I am now.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.593
Then I guess we should run.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.194
- Run?
- Mortals do it all the time!

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.116
[horn tooting]

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.953
- Run faster!
- I can't!

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.032
[grunts]

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.832
[roaring]

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.832
- Run faster!
- I can't!

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.748
[Horus] Come on!

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.589
[both grunt]

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.316
- We have to kill them.
- "We"?

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.356
When you go fishing,
what's most important?

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.032
- I don't fish.
- It's the quality of the bait.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.998
- It's too dangerous.
- Are you worried about me?

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.719
No, it's just my aim with a spear
is not what it was.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.240
Then get closer before you throw it.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.594
Hey! Beautiful!

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.397
- I meant the snake!
- [grunts]

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.152
[roaring]

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.508
[grunts]

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:05.874
[screams]

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.509
[grunting]

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.628
[snake groaning]

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.955
That worked great. Let's go again.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.554
This time, the bait
needs to dangle longer.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.240
I must strike the weak spot from behind.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.599
And how do you know
they have a weak spot?

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.113
I don't. But they must, right?

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.394
- Go!
- [whimpering]

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.873
[roars]

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.508
[exclaims]

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.189
[roars]

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.229
[Bek grunts]

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.871
Excellent! You've made it angry.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.949
[pants]

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.989
[yells]

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:16.715
[panting]

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.395
[grunting]

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.195
- [Horus groans]
- Too bad you can no longer fly.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.316
[grunting]

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.953
[Bek exclaims]

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.752
Neither can you.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.038
[screaming]

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.399
[continues screaming]

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.038
[Bek chuckles]

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.994
You!

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.430
Just shut up and stay out of my way.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.439
[roaring]

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.116
Pretty girl, you don't belong in battle.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.238
Burn her!

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.514
[hissing]

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.639
What a lovely creature you are.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.237
Let me help you.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.476
Burn her!

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.514
You are so very cold.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.514
Warm yourself. I command you.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.558
[growling]

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.039
[screaming]

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.955
Quickly.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.997
[roaring]

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.033
[Astarte screaming]

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.032
Your company was preferable.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.948
[Horus] <i>Outrageous!</i>

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.519
[Hathor] You're welcome
for saving your life.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.079
So while I was sitting blind
in my father's tomb,

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.799
you shared a bed with the god
who pulled out my eyes.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.440
Why would I waste this
on someone who can't see?

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.192
Why would I ever
trust you again?

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.953
He's slaying all the gods
who won't bow to him.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.712
That includes me.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.237
We're breaking into Set's temple.
Horus is going to kill him.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.753
How were you planning to get in?

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.760
Him?

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.512
He's seen the plans. He knows the way.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.720
What about the Sphinx?
Have you forgotten about that?

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.554
- Sphinx?
- Set captured it to guard his fire.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.394
It will kill mercilessly all who enter
if they cannot answer its riddle.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.800
You can answer the riddle, right?

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.916
We shall ask Thoth for help.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.389
[scoffs] Why would you ever
do that on purpose?

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.359
So we won't have to die any sooner
than is absolutely necessary. Let's go.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.678
Did he give you that dress?

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.397
I chose from what was provided.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.153
So you chose the one you thought
would please him the most.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.071
- I dress to please myself.
- [Horus] Hmm.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.116
Why? You don't like it?

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.077
It's too much.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.628
I'm the Goddess of Too Much.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.110
And there's plenty I've given you
you've never found excessive.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.671
- Ah.
- Now it's maybe too little.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.228
You never used to be so hard to please.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.878
You're slowing us down.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.309
Ooh.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.430
I think it makes you look roguish.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.272
What did I look like before?

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.191
- Oblivious.
- Oh!

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.748
- But in a cute way.
- Oblivious of what?

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.952
Exactly. You always did
take me for granted.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.234
What?

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.436
With your eye back,
you should have come to get me.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.351
- Oh?
- Don't I mean enough to you?

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.240
[Hathor screams]

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.472
[laughing]

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.073
Be a dear and fetch me some clean water.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.678
Would it kill you to say "please"?

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.671
I'm really not in the mood to argue.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:29.913
Go get it for me. I command you.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.591
You're all the same, aren't you?

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.392
What's her name?

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.835
I can make any man, woman,
god or beast do my bidding.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.069
Unless their heart belongs to another.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.192
You're in love.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.037
Her name's... Zaya.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.917
I'm so sorry.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.870
I promised her a proper home.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.916
Money for a family.
Respectability.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.389
I gave her nothing.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.835
Oh, she wouldn't have been with you
if she didn't love you.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.554
- Believe me, I know.
- I'm going to make it up to her.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.788
But I thought she...

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.639
- Horus is going to bring her back.
- He said that?

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.233
I know it's hard to see past his

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.709
short temper and proclamations
of revenge but...

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.198
He's not so bad.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.279
It is hard to see.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.718
There it is.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:39.754
[metallic rattling]

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.994
[Bek] Is that him?

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.875
- Them?
- Of course not.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.029
Then who are they?
[gasps]

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.236
His trusted servants.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.597
He only trusts himself.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.796
Rich with generous compost.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.996
Colorful.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.833
Mainly in the green
and red spectrums.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.675
Variegated varieties with inflorescences
composed of multiple florets,

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.910
each with a modified calyx.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.237
Wise Lord of the Sacred Word,
we seek your counsel.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.596
Once, a weed,
uprooted and burned.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:45.038
Now prized for the vigor of its oils
and the sustenance of its leaves.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.588
But what is its truth?

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.796
You! Turn around.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.791
You prefer the view from behind?

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.916
No, l... Well, yes.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.275
You know I can't lie. Turn.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.915
I'm not going to risk
looking at those tricky eyes of yours.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.309
- Forty-seven.
- Excuse me?

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.958
The percentage of knowledge
I have so far recorded.

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.439
I'm not even half done.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.919
Thoth, I only need...

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.752
The answer to the riddle of the Sphinx.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.035
A child could deduce why you're here.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.510
Go ask the riddle
and come back and relay it to me.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.036
- I'll solve it.
- One of us would have to die.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.758
Well, draw lots.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.030
- Come with us.
- Ha!

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.588
- One night. I'll give you one night.
- Hmm...

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.233
No, you won't.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.834
Set must be stopped
before he destroys us all.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.354
You see the wisdom in that, don't you?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.989
This is far too important to risk.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.435
I can recite
the true names of the stars.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.589
I know.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.477
I've seen the world created
from sand and water.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.560
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.517
I contain all the wisdom in the universe.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:51.151
More precious than some crown.
Ha! I have it!

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.232
Its mystery. Its essence. Its truth.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.158
It's lettuce!

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.234
Your father dropped his guard.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.675
That was not only extremely stupid,

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.558
but now I'm forced to
write down everything I know

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.551
as a defense against
the remote possibility

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.551
that Set's war finds me.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.475
I'm sorry that the corpses of my parents
have inconvenienced you.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.711
Apology accepted. Now, get out!

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.075
But you have to help us!

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.275
[swords clattering]

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.918
[Thoth] Careful.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.434
I outnumber you.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.230
It's fine. I'll do it.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.356
I thought you were a stray baboon.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.829
I told you I'd be the one
to face the Sphinx.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.673
Your chance of failure is overwhelming.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.558
I'm sure. But before it kills me
I'm going to tell it that I asked

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.189
the God of Wisdom to come but he was
afraid he'd get the answer wrong.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.874
This is the cleverest strategy
you could devise?

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:52.238
Playing on my ego?
How vain do you think I am?

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.630
Um... Hmm.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.519
Yes, well...

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.669
Fine.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.479
Fine!

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.479
Let's go.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.555
Bye.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.759
Well done.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.909
Thank you.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.475
[Hathor] You know his Zaya
can never come back.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.312
The King doesn't have the power.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.313
Anubis doesn't have the power.
You deceived him.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.915
He will probably die
trying to break into Set's pyramid.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.911
He offered his life.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.672
Because he thought
he could save her.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.352
He believes what he
wants to believe.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.398
You've been blind
in more ways than one.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.755
You really watched the world
come into being?

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.068
I don't lie.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.953
Where were you watching it from,
if nothing had been created yet?

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.719
If I even attempted to explain,

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.076
your brain would liquefy
and run out of your ears.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.399
I did not choose a path of revenge.
I chose none of this.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.596
You tell me what kind of power
do I really have?

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.114
You have the power
to make this right.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.236
He deserves
to know the truth.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.029
I need him to get us in
to choke Set's fire.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.554
If he refuses, we'll all die.
Is that what you want?

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.591
It's too dangerous to cross the plain.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.990
- We'll wait for darkness.
- But we're running out of time.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.680
- I say we cross now.
- And I say we wait.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.511
[exhales]

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.039
All the time you were apart,
she never forgot you.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.150
You've always been in
Hathor's heart, you know.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.310
Yes, but she's got a big heart.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.072
Room enough for a crowd in there.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.874
Tell me, oh, wise Lord of the Air.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.190
Why do you think Set let you live?

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:17.596
She did it for love.
You'd punish her for that?

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.433
I didn't want her help.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.119
I only ever wanted one thing.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.513
You know,
I think everyone's a fool.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.751
But you, My Lord,
are bigger than most.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.157
[Hathor]
Are you thinking about her?

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.551
Of course you are.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.870
I was once known
as the Mistress of the West.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.158
My duty was to help dead souls
make their way to the Afterlife.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.390
You traveled
to the Land of the Dead?

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.392
I'm the Goddess of Love.
Even to those who have died.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.596
I was young. Easily seduced.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.240
- "Seduced"?
- Demons.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.311
This keeps them at bay.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.437
The Bracelet of 42 Stars.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.512
One for each of the demons
Horus slayed to free me.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.710
That's when I knew
I loved him.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.109
Zaya needs to know
you're fighting for her.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.634
So she does not lose hope.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.039
[whispers] Zaya.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.279
Zaya.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:48.954
Zaya? Zaya?
Can you hear me?

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.433
Zaya?

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.393
Who is it?

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.799
Who's there?

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:58.071
<i>- Hathor, Mistress of the West.</i>
- [Zaya] <i>Mistress.</i>

01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.991
I speak to you
from the Land of the Living.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.399
Your beloved is with me.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.471
<i>- Bek?</i>
- Zaya, it's me.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.757
<i>I knew if there was a way,
you would find it.</i>

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.911
But I can't see you.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.355
[Bek] <i>Listen, we can be together again.
You can return.</i>

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480
But how?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.149
I'm helping Horus.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.754
In return,
he's going to help us.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.592
[Zaya] <i>It is really
the Bek I love?</i>

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.910
I know, Zaya. I can hardly
believe it myself.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.991
Bek, me, trusting the gods.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.033
But I was wrong, Zaya.

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.355
Horus is a just god,
as you said he would be.

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.237
You're probably thinking,
"I told you so," right now.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.437
Well, yes. Just a little bit.
[laughs]

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.878
It's so good to hear your voice.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.030
[Bek] <i>Everything's going
to be fine, Zaya, trust me.</i>

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.997
<i>Horus is going
to bring you back.</i>

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.513
<i>I know he will.</i>

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.999
Bek?

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.632
Bek, are you there?

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.071
- [staff clatters]
- [gasps]

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.550
It is forbidden for the dead
to speak with the living.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.280
Go.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.997
There's a wheel inside.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.036
When you turn it,
the sand stops moving.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.758
We just need
to go through the door.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:25.398
Good thing you saw
those plans.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.516
[Horus] If you didn't know
which one it was,

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.471
this would truly be impossible.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:32.749
- Bek?
- Yes?

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.308
You do know
which is the door, right?

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.513
Yes, of course, it's...
This one.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.439
No, no, it's...
It's that one.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.951
No, no, it's this one!

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.959
Roll the bones.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.358
[grunts]

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.189
[yelling]

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.674
[yelling]

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.793
[rhythmic thumping]

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.233
[chuckles]

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.674
You guessed?

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.318
[stutters] Well...

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.756
I find your dependence
on chance troubling.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.310
If you continue to survive,
I may need to study you further.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.119
Now, which way to the Sphinx?

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:33.070
Trespassers in the House of the King,
answer my riddle or cease to be.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.556
Go on. I'm waiting.

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.434
[growls]

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.028
I never was.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.910
Am always to be.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.390
No one ever saw me, nor ever will.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:51.268
And yet I am the confidence
of all who live and breathe.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.989
What am I?

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.475
Order. You are Order.

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:04.752
I never doubted you.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.269
[grunting]

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.756
Incorrect.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.398
Try again. Please.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.148
That was a completely suitable answer.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.676
- [growling]
- You are Purity.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.752
- [grunts]
- [yelling]

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.308
[gasps]

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.630
Wrong again.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.790
[stuttering]
"What never was."

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.474
"Always to be."

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.869
In the future. Non-existent. Imaginary.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.234
[roaring]

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.473
- [grunts]
- Yet...

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.279
Yet it exists and "never was."

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.158
- "Always to be."
- [straining] Thoth...

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.470
"Yet I'm the confidence
of all who live and breathe."

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.154
Mortals live and breathe!
Maybe stop thinking like a god.

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.754
- Then I might as well stop thinking.
- Thoth!

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.671
Wait, wait, I have it!
You are Tomorrow.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.910
Oh, bother.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.834
[grunts]

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.433
[Horus] One drop.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.189
[grunts]

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.280
No!

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.918
[voices echoing and murmuring]

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.160
[groaning]

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.038
I should thank you.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:53.557
You lured him from his library
so that I didn't have to.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.638
The final piece.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.358
You coward.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.159
- Open this gate and fight me.
- Again?

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.151
Hasn't she seen you lose enough?

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.470
Can't you allow me to spare you one last
moment of embarrassment before you die?

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.629
Stop!

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.752
Recognize this?

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.118
Did he tell you he could bring
your woman back from death?

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:23.359
It's not possible.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.433
Not even for me.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.516
You expect me to believe you?

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.711
I don't have to lie.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.955
How else would a blind,
useless god get you to help him?

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.953
Go on.

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.548
Ask him.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.556
- Pour it in.
- Is it true?

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.151
Bek, pour it in!

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.719
No!

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.949
[Set grunts]

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.469
Shame you weren't on my side.

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.632
I admire someone that doesn't
let death stand in his way.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:09.315
But this is what love gets you.

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:14.749
It's quite fitting that you'll both
die together here in my house.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.435
I'll miss the conversation.
And the rest.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.200
[gasps]

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.474
[grunting]

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.678
[grunting]

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.198
[Horus grunts]

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.633
[coughing]

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.469
[exhales heavily]

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.516
You denied me vengeance.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:13.999
[panting]

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.072
Zaya thought you were
the greatest thing in all of creation.

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.032
Every day, she prayed for you
to save Egypt, but you didn't come.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.954
- I was in a tomb. I didn't hear.
- No, you didn't listen.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.475
All you care about
is your stupid vengeance.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.035
I started to think
I was wrong about you.

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.951
But I've finally learned
the lesson of the gods.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.234
We don't matter to you.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.192
Well, now you know.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.630
Anubis, come forth.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.473
[snarling]

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.071
Mistress.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.357
You are still
as lovely as the first dawn.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.158
Hathor, what are you doing?

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:15.198
This mortal's beloved bears
no treasure for the scales.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:19.671
- Perhaps we can help her.
- You ask much, Mistress.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.753
It would require a very
special treasure indeed.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.400
- No. No. No!
- Like this?

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.711
For you, Mistress of the West?

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.633
Yes.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.110
Grant him passage
to give it to her himself.

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.996
- You will see her one last time.
- Thank you.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.870
No, no, I forbid it.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.155
We're both guilty of deceiving Bek.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.950
- This will make amends.
- Not like this. Not with you.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.679
I command you to release me.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.514
You can't command me. You know why.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.438
I'm the Goddess of Love.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:10.671
- If I don't do this, I'm nothing.
- I can't lose you again.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.477
[groans]

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.035
Take it.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.756
Do what you need to do.

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.196
The Hall of Two Truths.

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.869
Where we shall be judged.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.196
Step forward.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.989
What do you offer?

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.869
[scale clicking]

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.438
Step forward.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:04.389
I shall live forever!

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.511
What do you offer?

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.389
[scale clicking]

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.952
Step forward.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.075
[screaming]

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.308
Step forward.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.110
What do you offer?

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.349
What do you offer?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Zaya.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:10.715
[chuckles softly] Bek.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.156
[Set roaring]

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:43.032
[slaves] Set, receive the
golden wings of Nephthys.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.476
May they protect him
from those who would harm.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.034
[clanking]

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:02.675
[slaves] The karr of Thoth,
God of Wisdom.

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:05.035
Allow him knowledge of old.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.154
[electricity crackling]

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:16.353
The heart of Osiris.
Grant him dominion over all Lands.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.835
The all-seeing eye.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.879
Reward him so no enemy can deceive.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:27.874
[growling]

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.635
[Set grunts]

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.390
You look glorious, Lord.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.068
I know.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.440
[Set] Father...

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.919
I noticed the tower. Impressive.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.231
I built it for you.

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:22.073
If it were any taller,
it would be in my way.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:26.438
Turn your eyes from your sails
and look at everything I've done.

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.511
What Osiris never could.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.636
I rule all that breathes.

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.471
And all that is breathed upon.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.959
None is mightier below the sun.

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:42.157
Then honor me as I've honored you.

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.992
If honor had been your intent,

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:47.078
you might have abstained
from murdering your brother.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.118
So you do see everything down there.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.556
Tell me, Father,
do you care what happens?

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.550
I care more than you know.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.154
Then why was I cast out alone...

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.708
[whispering]
...to walk on burning sand,

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.951
while my brother played barefoot
by the shores of the Nile?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.552
Why did you make Osiris King?
And why did you give him a son?

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:21.279
And yet you denied me
the chance to even give life.

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.557
- This was your test.
- You didn't test him.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.518
I gave Osiris the crown of Egypt.

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:32.599
And when the time came,
he didn't cling to his power.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:37.196
He gave it away freely.
He passed his test.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.078
- And I'd wager I've passed mine.
- Not yet.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.638
It's true...

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:44.918
I did not want you to have children.

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:49.634
This was a kindness,
because I did not want you to miss them

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.119
as terribly as I have.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.474
Miss them?

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.950
I need you to take my place.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.074
Here?

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.754
This is how your test ends, my son.

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.274
There is no greater burden.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.798
But no greater honor.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.070
All you have done can be forgiven.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:25.756
You expect me to joust with this beast

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.594
night after night until I die?

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.557
What do you want?

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:33.437
Immortality.

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.996
Immortality awaits us
all in the Afterlife.

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.799
I don't want to die. I want to live.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:43.714
Forever.
Down there in the lands I conquered.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.190
My kingdom.
This should be my reward.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:50.477
How? The only way to achieve
this is unthinkable.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.269
- One would need to devour...
- The Afterlife itself.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.749
You would unleash Chaos
upon creation?

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.876
You would destroy everything?

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:04.273
Not destroy. Reshape it.
I will take your place.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.749
But it won't be sitting
on some damn boat.

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.598
[Set breathing heavily]

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.670
No god could withstand that.

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.350
I'm not just one god.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.349
[gasps]

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.479
What do you offer?

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.516
This will buy you
a place in the Afterlife.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.600
[Zaya] No.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.028
Not without you.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:24.755
[rumbling]

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.278
[souls screaming]

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.638
The gate has been broken!
Chaos spreads.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.836
Apophis shall destroy this land.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.431
[Apophis grunting]

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.751
Horus is our only hope now.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.400
He's not the god you think he is, Zaya.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.671
- He lied to me.
- Give him another chance.

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.432
He only got this far because of you.

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.670
My strength is not infinite.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:02.752
If the Lord of the Air
has any plan to rectify this,

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:04.751
he should do so with haste.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.599
If you don't trust him, trust me.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.796
I know we'll be together again.

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.477
Ra has fallen.
Set has unleashed Chaos.

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.993
So how do we stop him?

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.037
You never give up, do you?

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.633
Only because Zaya told me not to.

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.433
You didn't tell her about our bargain?

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.910
Yes, I did tell her. But for some
reason, she still believes in you.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.113
We must return to the capital.

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.753
Then we have a long walk ahead of us.

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:45.159
[birds chirping]

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.389
I prefer flying.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.280
Nephthys.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.156
Even beyond death,
she's trying to help us.

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.629
[thunder rumbling]

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.551
Come, demon!

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.108
[growling]

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.350
[Horus] Set has Ra's spear.

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.432
He's drawing Apophis to the Nile,
to the source of all life.

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.520
Why?

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.034
To drink it. To destroy all creation.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.112
Ra isn't dead. And only he
can make this right.

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.952
But he needs his spear.

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.598
So how do we get it back?

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.919
Maybe it's time we go fishing.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.116
[Urshu praying indistinctly]

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.509
I come in your service,
I ask for your help.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.874
- [gasps]
- [Horus] Builder.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.439
We have need of you.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.954
[rumbling]

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.388
[soldiers shouting]

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.077
It is the single greatest
architectural achievement

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.593
that ever was and ever will be.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.073
My...

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.153
I mean, Lord Set's obelisk

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:51.190
stands exactly 2,220 cubits tall.
And not a rod off.

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.636
Built from seven billion
blocks of granite,

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.953
five billion slabs of Tura limestone,
and nine billion talents of gold.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.951
And the lives of how many slaves?

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.236
5,930.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.276
No, wait.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.872
Make that 5,931.

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.195
Don't! You need him
to get to the roof.

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.909
[Horus] I'll see you up top.

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.634
[grunts]

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.309
You stood beside him
as if he were your friend.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.436
Oh, I know how it feels.
Favor of a god.

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.670
It's intoxicating.

01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:59.069
I'm sorry you picked
the wrong one to follow.

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:00.639
He's improving.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.915
Your woman's still dead, isn't she?

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.912
Shame. Such a pretty girl.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.274
Hmm...

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.316
Such lovely soft skin.

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.436
[groans]

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.672
Riches for the Afterlife.

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.113
[Bek coughs]

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.475
You see? I'm ready to die.

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.433
[both grunt]

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.593
[Apophis growling]

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:51.754
[grunting]

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.949
[Set] Come, Apophis!

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.275
[thunder rumbling]

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:29.749
[groans]

01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:40.916
You should have
stayed under the sand.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.958
I can understand killing for a crown,
but this is madness.

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:46.679
Of course you don't understand.
How could you?

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:49.194
Favored son of a favored son.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.228
[groans]

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.559
[Bek yelling]

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.359
[gagging]

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:40.189
By the way, Apophis is going to eat
the Land of the Dead.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.633
You'll never make it
to the Afterlife now.

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:42.789
[strains] What?

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.149
[yelling]

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.478
Who picked the wrong god now?

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.194
[groans]

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.589
[both grunting]

01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:27.398
I think I may actually miss
our little get-togethers.

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.395
[groans]

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.597
But you're still no match for me.

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:36.954
You're right.

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.592
I'm just the bait.

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.958
Now you're just becoming a pest.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.959
[Set grunts]

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:51.955
[Bek exclaims]

01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.315
[Bek grunts]

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.349
[groans]

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.996
Horus!

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.717
[yells]

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.119
[grunting]

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:43.115
[grunts]

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.637
You don't think your eye might have been
more useful than a wounded thief?

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.312
Probably, yes.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.756
I'm sorry for everything
I've done to you.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:00.193
[grunts]

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:03.353
- Including this.
- Accepted.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:36.277
[chuckles] I told you
I'd steal your other eye.

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:39.033
But you could have saved me some trouble
and told me you didn't need it.

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:42.277
Ra showed me the way,
but I didn't listen.

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:44.715
I believed I needed my eye
to transform,

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:48.475
but my journey isn't to seek
revenge at all costs.

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:51.476
It is to protect my people.

01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.275
Stop congratulating yourself.

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.952
You've got more protecting to do.

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:10.514
[groans softly]

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:22.235
[people cheering]

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.195
[Set grunting]

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.998
[Set groaning]

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.192
[screaming]

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:20.875
[grunts]

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:31.749
[Apophis growling]

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:32.909
[soldiers screaming]

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:57.798
[groaning softly]

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.119
[coughing]

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:16.395
[breathing heavily]

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.678
Behold, the new King.

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:28.274
I thought you were
the greatest of all the gods.

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.271
- [grunts]
- Now look at you.

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.112
You have nothing.

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:35.510
I am the greatest god.

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:38.558
I spared you once. Huh?

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:42.628
- I showed you mercy.
- I won't make that mistake.

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:44.509
[grunts]

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.389
[Horus] Grandfather, there's still time.

01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.111
Enough, beast!

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:17.035
[Apophis groans]

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.399
[sighs]

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.355
Thank you.

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.113
[crowd cheering]

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.074
[applause]

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:40.799
[Horus] We make a good team.

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.636
Are you sure you're not a god?

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:45.836
What would I be the god of?

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.319
[exhales heavily]

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.913
Stupidity?

01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.275
The lmpossible.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.275
Bek?

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:55.672
I have never been in debt.
And yet I am in debt to you, grandson.

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.153
Ask whatever you will.

01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:01.356
Mountains will kneel before you.

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.112
The winds will do your bidding.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.714
Answer quickly,
for Apophis still hungers.

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:08.915
And night is always coming.

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:13.840
I want nothing.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:18.117
Except what's impossible for me to give.

01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.073
[gasping]

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.912
Am l...

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.911
- [chuckles] You've returned.
- [laughing]

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.672
[Horus] Bek?

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:50.994
You might want to help her.

01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:54.475
Zaya.

01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:58.759
[Zaya breathes heavily]

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.199
[softly] Bek.

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:02.554
[Horus] Zaya?

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:05.915
- I'm Horus.
- My Lord.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.433
I thought this was impossible.

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:10.432
Impossible? Yes.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.228
[crowd cheering]

01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:22.357
[crowd] Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:26.758
Hail Ra, Lord of Light!

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:31.349
[Older Bek] <i>And so
wisdom had been found.</i>

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.910
<i>Tests had been passed.
Second chances given.</i>

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.515
<i>To live again.
To be whole again.</i>

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:41.359
<i>Horus mourned his parents.</i>

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:43.749
<i>They had long since passed
into the Afterlife.</i>

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:45.990
<i>But he knew
it was the wisdom of Ra</i>

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:49.277
<i>that the Final Gate would
remain as it had always been.</i>

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:54.235
<i>An unbreakable barrier between
this life and immortality.</i>

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.514
You think I'm ready?

01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:01.470
Hmm, true readiness is a notoriously
difficult state to achieve.

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.552
- But you're close enough.
- Hmm.

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:19.638
Arise, Horus...

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.678
King of all Egypt.

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.438
[crowd cheering]

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:36.953
From this moment on, the Afterlife
must be earned, not with gold,

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:43.238
but by good deeds,
compassion, and generosity.

01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:47.757
What we do, how we act
in this life matters.

01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.878
[crowd cheering]

01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:57.192
Are you thinking about her?

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.280
Of course, you are.

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:06.909
You didn't think I'd misplace
Egypt's greatest treasure?

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:10.915
You think they'd miss me
if I were gone a few days?

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.070
As Chief Advisor to the King,

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:15.071
it's my duty to ensure
they hardly notice.

01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.230
- [chuckles]
- [Bek] But if anyone asks...

01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:18.958
Tell them I had
to go help a friend.

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:24.795
I leave Egypt
in your capable hands.

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.234
[chuckles]
