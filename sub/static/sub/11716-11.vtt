WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.381
Can you believe they fit
38 sugar cubes in here?

00:08.383 --> 00:09.551
Hey, how much
will you give me

00:09.677 --> 00:09.969
if I can put them all
in my mouth?

00:12.638 --> 00:13.305
Nothing.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.140
You're on.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.061
Hey.
Hey.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.647
Hi, honey.

00:21.772 --> 00:22.648
Stop it.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.320
All of them.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.951
So, good news.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.369
You know how we wanted
the Central Park birdhouse

00:35.494 --> 00:37.287
for our wedding?
Yep.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.372
They had a cancellation.
It's ours in two weeks.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.374
Oh, wow,
that's good news.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.041
I thought you were planning
your wedding in your hometown.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.919
We were, but that's
when the boathouse
wasn't available.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.296
Now, it is.
Oh, I love the boathouse.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.923
Such a romantic setting.

00:48.047 --> 00:50.342
You know what else
is romantic?

00:50.467 --> 00:51.259
The coatroom
in the boathouse.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.806
Don't act like
you don't remember
that bar mitzvah.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.476
Anyway,
all I have to do

00:59.601 --> 01:00.811
is call this woman Heidi
back to confirm.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.396
Oh, Heidi!

01:02.521 --> 01:04.023
Hope it isn't Heidi-ho.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.441
Oh. (SCOFFS)
Here we go.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.985
Who's "Heidi-ho"?

01:08.109 --> 01:09.653
This woman that Jeff and I
went to college with

01:09.778 --> 01:11.822
who always had a thing
for him.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.657
Audrey thinks that
Heidi and I had a fling

01:13.782 --> 01:15.242
before we started dating,
but we didn't.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.494
I know that's hard
to imagine,

01:17.619 --> 01:18.537
what, with all of this.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.122
(CHUCKLES)

01:21.248 --> 01:22.791
Well, why are you so sure
she did?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.209
Because she would
openly flirt with him

01:24.334 --> 01:26.003
right in front of me,
touching him,

01:26.127 --> 01:28.047
laughing at his jokes.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.006
He's not funny.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.884
So for our wedding,
I figured...

01:32.009 --> 01:33.552
AUDREY: You wanna know why?

01:33.677 --> 01:35.596
Because we see her
at a reunion,

01:35.721 --> 01:36.805
she still flirts with him.
No, she doesn't,

01:36.931 --> 01:38.473
why are we still
talking about this?

01:38.599 --> 01:40.225
Because you won't
just admit it!

01:40.350 --> 01:41.602
I'm not gonna take credit
for something that isn't true.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.395
Oh, please.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.397
You take credit for
inventing the word
"supersize."

01:45.522 --> 01:47.775
Hey, I heard a lot of people
start using that word

01:47.900 --> 01:48.859
right around the same time
I did.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.404
So enough about us
and our big day.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.280
What's up
with you guys?

01:57.993 --> 01:59.954
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.584
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not scared?

02:07.628 --> 02:12.466
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

02:12.591 --> 02:15.218
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:23.518 --> 02:24.478
Here's your lunch, sir.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.730
Great.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.565
Oh, hey, can you call
the manufacturer

02:28.690 --> 02:30.943
of my fancy watch
and report a problem?

02:31.068 --> 02:32.987
Oh, um,
what problem is that?

02:33.112 --> 02:35.823
Well, it says
it's 12:37,

02:35.948 --> 02:38.366
but that can't be right
because I know my lunch

02:38.492 --> 02:39.785
is supposed to come
no later than 12:30.

02:42.997 --> 02:46.166
I get it, I'm seven minutes
late with your lunch.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.334
Perhaps you could've snacked
on your self-satisfaction.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.754
So what happened?

02:50.879 --> 02:54.133
Did you make some sort
of detour?

02:54.257 --> 02:56.343
No, sir, just a long line
at the deli today.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.512
Oh, you didn't
stop anywhere?

02:58.637 --> 02:59.972
Not even
that nerdy bookstore

03:00.097 --> 03:00.931
with the vintage books
you like?

03:02.432 --> 03:03.809
The one that smells
like antique farts?

03:06.645 --> 03:09.023
Um, you know,
come to think of it,

03:09.148 --> 03:09.815
I did pop
into that shop...

03:09.940 --> 03:11.108
Oh, okay.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.401
But how did you know?

03:13.527 --> 03:14.987
Oh, just...
Lucky guess.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.405
I suppose so.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.366
Hey, Tim,

03:19.491 --> 03:21.284
in the future,
maybe no more lies?

03:23.411 --> 03:25.831
I mean,
I don't lie to you.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.166
I'd expect the same
in return.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.376
You do nothing
but lie to me.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.504
Oh, boo-hoo, Tim.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.131
Go cry to your friends
at the fart store!

03:41.555 --> 03:43.640
So Audrey's still upset
with that Heidi girl?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.559
Yeah, you know,
Audrey and I have had a lot
of fights over the years,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.602
but this is truly
one of her favorites

03:47.728 --> 03:48.854
because she knows
I can't win.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.315
What?
Why can't you win?

03:52.440 --> 03:53.942
'Cause you can't prove
a negative.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.903
Sure you can.
No, you can't.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.113
It's like if I said
"Hey, I heard that,
one time at camp,

03:58.238 --> 03:58.989
"you touched
another dude's wiener."

04:00.490 --> 04:01.324
Well, Kyle's a liar.

04:07.998 --> 04:08.707
Wait, what?
What, what?

04:08.832 --> 04:09.666
Who?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.211
Uh, nothing.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.130
Oh.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.965
Well, listen,
if you didn't
sleep with Heidi,

04:17.091 --> 04:19.051
you should have,
because Audrey
already thinks you did

04:19.176 --> 04:20.802
which supports my theory:

04:20.928 --> 04:23.222
Never leave untapped
that which could be tapped.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.683
It was never
really an option.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.102
She's just
a flirty girl.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.603
I mean, she was that way
with everybody.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.563
Well, I believe you
because you're trustworthy,

04:31.688 --> 04:32.689
and that's
an important quality,

04:34.274 --> 04:35.442
one that I like
in my best man.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.945
Oh, boy.
Oh, no.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.738
Yes, yes,
this is a tough
decision for me,

04:39.863 --> 04:42.532
but you're the two guys
who know me the best.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.408
I don't know.
Kyle might know
a thing or two.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.369
No.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.289
No.
It's gotta be you two.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.126
You know, as much
as I hate to say this,

04:52.251 --> 04:53.376
I really think
Russell's the man
for the job.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.295
He's your boss.
All right.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.213
He took you
under his little wing.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.134
You know,
but what I say

05:00.259 --> 05:01.802
is that I think
it might be Jeff

05:01.927 --> 05:04.054
because he's been
to the altar.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.513
He's made the
same mistake,
you know?

05:06.514 --> 05:08.683
Yeah, I, I...
I was a...

05:08.809 --> 05:09.893
I was afraid you guys
might fight over this.

05:11.311 --> 05:11.937
Is that
what's happening?

05:13.521 --> 05:15.482
Well, that's why
I prepared this:

05:15.607 --> 05:18.152
A list of questions
to see who knows me best.

05:18.277 --> 05:18.944
Now, whoever can
answer the most

05:19.945 --> 05:21.113
gets to be my best man.

05:21.238 --> 05:21.947
Question one:

05:23.865 --> 05:25.033
What is
my middle name?

05:25.159 --> 05:25.909
Suckhole.
Who gives a crap?

05:27.869 --> 05:29.454
The correct answer
is "Shannon."

05:31.498 --> 05:34.375
Um, but Russell's closest
with the "s" guess,

05:34.501 --> 05:35.294
so hey,
you get the point.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.424
Hey.
Hey!

05:41.549 --> 05:42.968
Listen, I didn't know
if you were hungry,

05:43.093 --> 05:44.052
so I got you
a meatball sub.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.012
Ate mine
on the way home.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.598
No, I already
had dinner.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.474
I was hoping
you'd say that.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.353
So just for fun,

05:54.479 --> 05:56.231
I decided to check out
Heidi-ho's Facebook profile.

05:57.774 --> 05:58.692
You seem happy.
(GIGGLES)

05:58.817 --> 05:59.734
How fat is she?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.447
Oh, no.
She's not fat.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.365
I am happy because
of a certain picture
she posted.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.909
Uh-huh,
what am I looking at here?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.745
That's you in college
without a shirt at a party.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.248
"Where is your shirt?"
You may ask.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.416
Your shirt is on that girl
sitting on your lap
kissing your cheek.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.918
She's wearing it.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.795
So Heidi's wearing
my shirt.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.214
And kissing you!

06:20.339 --> 06:22.132
This proves I'm right.
No.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.343
It was probably cold,
so I gave her my shirt.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.094
All it proves is
that I was a gentleman.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.180
(SCOFFS AND LAUGHS)

06:28.305 --> 06:30.140
All it proves
is this fight is over.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.143
I win.
No, it's not over.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.519
It's far from over!

06:38.273 --> 06:39.274
My God,
my pecs were defined.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.867
Oh, excellent draping,
Felipe,

06:48.992 --> 06:50.535
and thanks for remembering
that I dress to the right.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.997
(EXHALES)
Well, well, well.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.665
Lookie here.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.709
What are the chances?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.379
Sir, what are
you doing here?

07:00.503 --> 07:01.922
I'm not
telling you anything
until you say,

07:02.047 --> 07:03.924
(BRITISH ACCENT)
"I'm a fancy lad
with fancy pants."

07:04.049 --> 07:05.300
No.
Say it.

07:05.424 --> 07:06.885
I will not.
Sing it.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.220
Negative.
Think it.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.221
Fine.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.058
(LAUGHS)

07:13.183 --> 07:14.976
For the past few weeks,
you seem to know
my every move.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.437
The bookstore,
the tailor,

07:17.562 --> 07:19.981
how many times
I've used the restroom.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.191
Yeah, what's with that?
You have a UTI or something?

07:23.151 --> 07:24.778
Fess up, sir.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.114
Did you install something
in my phone

07:27.239 --> 07:28.448
so that you could track
my whereabouts?

07:28.573 --> 07:30.200
In your phone?

07:30.325 --> 07:31.410
Well, that would've
been easier.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.579
Easier than what?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.290
Hey, a houndstooth
handkerchief.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.124
They still make these?

07:39.876 --> 07:40.627
What have you done?

07:41.628 --> 07:42.629
Uh, okay.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.924
Remember when
I made everyone
in the company

07:46.049 --> 07:46.967
get a mandatory
flu shot?

07:48.551 --> 07:51.388
Well, you were the only one
that actually got one.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.475
Why would you
bring in a nurse

07:55.600 --> 07:57.060
to give only me
a flu shot?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.895
Well, 'cause she wasn't
exactly a nurse.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.232
She was a veterinary assistant
I was dating at the time.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.483
No. Did...

08:05.235 --> 08:07.195
Did you implant
a tracking chip in me?

08:09.239 --> 08:10.198
I kinda did.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.870
You actually
inserted a microchip

08:15.996 --> 08:16.788
into my body
to track me.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.498
Unbelievable!

08:18.623 --> 08:20.583
You are an animal.

08:20.708 --> 08:21.709
I'm not the one
with a pet chip in him.

08:25.088 --> 08:25.964
Oh, no.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.091
Don't.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.259
Timmy, don't leave.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.594
I'll know
where you're going.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.809
Hey.
Hey.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.353
How'd the best man quiz go?

08:39.478 --> 08:40.228
Oh, they both went
1 for 30.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.439
Aw, that's not very good.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.731
I know.
Tied for first.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.735
This'll be tougher
than I thought.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.279
You know, I don't think I've
ever said this to you before,

08:52.282 --> 08:53.158
but maybe
you're over-thinking this.

08:54.117 --> 08:54.868
I do do that.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.536
(LAUGHS) "Doo-doo."

08:59.206 --> 09:00.707
Okay, why don't
you ask yourself

09:00.832 --> 09:01.624
who's been there for you
the most?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.544
Yeah.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.420
Yeah, like,
who would rescue me

09:05.545 --> 09:07.005
if I was in danger?

09:07.130 --> 09:08.715
That's not what I meant.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.218
When the chips are down,
and my life is on the line...

09:11.343 --> 09:13.512
(EXHALES) I don't like
where this is headed.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.055
You know, the only way
to really know

09:15.180 --> 09:16.556
who should be
my best man

09:16.681 --> 09:18.766
is to see who has my back
when it counts.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.643
Don't put yourself
in danger.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.896
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.064
Hey, thanks again, honey.
BOTH: Mmm.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.190
Great idea.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.863
Hey, you ready
for dinner?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.490
I was thinking
maybe we could stay in.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.033
Huh, we don't have
any food.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.326
Just have
something delivered.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.202
Come on.
I wanna go out.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.871
Fine.
Let's go out.

09:39.996 --> 09:40.914
Let me just take
a quick bath.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.043
Bath?
What's going on with you?

09:45.168 --> 09:46.253
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

09:46.378 --> 09:47.128
Aw, forget the bath.

09:48.171 --> 09:48.880
Just get the door.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.177
Audrey!

09:54.302 --> 09:57.222
Heidi-ho... My gosh.

09:57.347 --> 10:00.641
What are you doing here?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.477
Well, Jeff called
and asked me to come over.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.564
He did?
Yeah, yeah.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.525
He did.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.952
Audrey and I need you
to help us settle

10:19.077 --> 10:20.787
a little disagreement
that we're having.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.789
All right, okay.
This is all Jeff's idea.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.333
Frankly, I'm embarrassed
he asked you over here at all.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.709
Don't let her presence
embarrass you.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.379
Let her words do it.

10:29.504 --> 10:32.424
Now, Heidi,
could you tell Audrey

10:32.549 --> 10:34.217
the nature
of our college relationship

10:35.218 --> 10:36.636
in your own words?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.805
Well, we were friends
in college.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.557
Friends.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.100
So we saw
each other socially
and nothing more?

10:43.059 --> 10:43.643
Is that a fair assessment?

10:45.853 --> 10:48.231
Yeah, I guess
that's what friends are.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.775
Interesting, interesting.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.026
Your witness.
Jeff.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.696
(GASPS)
Wait a minute.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.865
Is that what
this is all about?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.576
Audrey, did you think
Jeff and I had
something going on?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.828
Well...no,
not when we were dating.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.080
I just thought,
you know,

11:04.205 --> 11:05.748
perhaps, you two
were an item

11:05.873 --> 11:07.834
before we started dating,
which is fine.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.129
It's not even
any of my business.
No, no, we never did anything.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.339
And that's not
from Facebook.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.133
That's from
her actual face.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.179
Well, honestly,
you had nothing to
worry about, Audrey.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.599
I mean, Jeff's
really not my type.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.892
(LAUGHS)
Yeah.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.936
He's really not
anyone's type, is he?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.104
(BOTH LAUGHING)

11:28.229 --> 11:29.314
(FORCED LAUGH)

11:29.439 --> 11:30.524
(LAUGHTER)

11:35.195 --> 11:36.070
(SCOFFS) Damn, voice mail.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.659
Jeff, Jeff, it's Adam.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.537
Look, I was climbing my
favorite rock in Central Park,
and my foot got stuck, okay?

11:43.662 --> 11:46.498
I need you to come
help me right away!
Please hurry.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.832
I don't want to have
to cut this thing off!

11:54.506 --> 11:55.465
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)

11:55.590 --> 11:56.757
Agh...

11:59.344 --> 12:00.178
Adam.

12:01.555 --> 12:02.472
"Ignore."

12:07.018 --> 12:07.726
The race is on, gentlemen.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.317
Timmy, what are
you doing here?

12:14.442 --> 12:17.028
You're supposed to be
at 74th and Broadway.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.948
I was there.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.577
It's my doctor's office
where I had the chip removed.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.328
Why? It was such a fun game!

12:27.955 --> 12:29.583
It was like  Where's Waldo?
But incredibly easy.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.295
Sorry, but the fun is over.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.089
Okay, look...

12:36.214 --> 12:38.633
My lunch has been late
a few times.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.719
You know how I get
when my blood sugar gets low.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.011
I turn into a bit
of a micromanager.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.014
Micro! (CHUCKLES)

12:45.139 --> 12:46.224
And I implanted you
with a microchip.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.393
That's wonderful.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.230
All right, what's this?

12:53.690 --> 12:55.483
It's my letter
of resignation.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.568
Oh, we have
a company letterhead?

12:58.528 --> 12:59.571
I didn't know that.
That's a good font.

12:59.696 --> 13:00.363
Can I get a bunch
of these?

13:01.864 --> 13:03.908
I cannot...

13:04.033 --> 13:06.119
As I no longer
work for you.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.581
Oh, come on.
This is the part
where I apologize

13:09.706 --> 13:12.626
and tell you to come back,
and then you say no,
and then you cave in.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.001
We've done this
a million times.
Can we not do it again?

13:15.629 --> 13:16.546
Good-bye, sir.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.886
Well, this
is a new wrinkle.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.434
(CHUCKLES) Heidi,
I am so glad you came.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.728
Thanks for making it
abundantly clear
that we never dated.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.021
(LAUGHTER)

13:34.147 --> 13:36.023
Well, it's hilarious that
you ever thought we did.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.359
(LAUGHS) I know.
A real hoot for all of us.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.278
(SIGHS)

13:40.403 --> 13:41.696
Anyway, we will see
you at the next reunion.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.573
Yes, I'm looking
forward to it.

13:43.698 --> 13:44.823
(LAUGHS)
I'll walk you out.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.367
Thanks.
(LAUGHS)

13:47.535 --> 13:48.869
JEFF: Thanks again for coming.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.664
Oh, happy to help,

13:50.789 --> 13:52.582
and I think she bought it.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.292
Yeah.
What did you just say?

13:57.420 --> 14:00.423
I said, "I think she bought
that I wasn't interested
in you back in college."

14:00.548 --> 14:02.091
I... I mean,
you knew I was, right?

14:03.677 --> 14:04.761
I did not know that.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.682
(LAUGHS) Oh, my God.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.017
Well, I mean,
I saw something was
bothering Audrey,

14:11.142 --> 14:14.562
so I played along,
but I totally had
a thing for you.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.731
Did you now?
(GIGGLES)

14:16.897 --> 14:19.609
Yes. I thought
it was so obvious.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.653
I was always flirting
with you and touching you

14:21.778 --> 14:24.572
and laughing
at your jokes.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.948
(LAUGHS)
How could you not see that?

14:26.073 --> 14:26.949
That's a good question.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.037
As a matter of fact,
when you called,

14:31.162 --> 14:32.706
I was kind of hoping
that's what this was about.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.832
(LAUGHTER)

14:35.249 --> 14:36.584
How about that?
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

14:36.710 --> 14:37.335
There you go.
(GIGGLES)

14:41.548 --> 14:42.674
It was really fun
seeing you.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.842
Fun isn't even the word.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.177
(SIGHS)

14:54.143 --> 14:56.771
All right. Go ahead.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.481
Gloat that you won
the 20-year argument.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.108
Yeah. I win.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.194
(CHUCKLES)

15:03.319 --> 15:05.822
You know, after talking
to her, I feel pretty dumb

15:05.946 --> 15:08.241
that I ever thought
there was anything
between you and Heidi.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.034
Yeah, well, there wasn't,
so let's just
forget the whole thing.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.870
You know,
I guess in my mind,

15:11.994 --> 15:13.454
she was skanky
because I resented her,

15:13.580 --> 15:14.955
but she's actually
really pretty.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.584
I mean, she's way
out of your league.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.711
(LAUGHS)

15:19.836 --> 15:22.505
(SIGHS)
Right.
Movin'...movin' on.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.173
(LAUGHS)

15:24.298 --> 15:27.134
Oh, God,
she could not have been
less interested in you.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.177
Yeah, I was here.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.640
Boy, did we have
a good laugh
about that one.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.518
Okay.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.562
Okay, you know,
I didn't wanna
have to tell you this,

15:39.898 --> 15:40.857
but if she's
so out of my league,

15:42.609 --> 15:44.360
then why did
she just hit on me?

15:44.485 --> 15:46.112
(LAUGHS)
That's a good one.

15:46.237 --> 15:49.490
No, she did,
right there at the elevator.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.660
Said that she's always
wanted some of this,
and, you know what?

15:52.786 --> 15:53.578
Still does.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.667
Honey, she just sat there
saying the complete opposite.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.294
That was all
for your benefit.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.421
Oh, ho, honey.
No, don't patronize me.

16:05.924 --> 16:09.510
There's an attractive
woman out there
who is hot for me.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.221
Okay, sweetheart,
you cannot have this
both ways, okay?

16:12.346 --> 16:15.141
You just spent 20 years
trying to convince me
she wasn't into you.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.269
You finally did!
You won! Enjoy it!

16:18.978 --> 16:19.896
(CHUCKLES)

16:21.648 --> 16:22.565
(SIGHS)

16:24.442 --> 16:25.819
I can't, I can't.
Not like this.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.991
Heidi.
Heidi, it's Jeff. Yeah.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.452
Could you come on
back up here,

16:34.577 --> 16:35.954
and tell Audrey how
you've always wanted me
and still do?

16:38.873 --> 16:39.290
What do you mean?
How is that weird?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.131
(SIGHS)
Hey.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.593
So Adam didn't
come home last night.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.136
Oh, you know what?
You should think
about chipping him.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.056
He was waiting
for you idiots,

16:56.182 --> 16:58.267
and neither of you
were any help at all.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.979
Don't look at me.
I didn't get a message.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.772
Well, it didn't work.
He was at the park all night.

17:02.897 --> 17:03.731
What was he doing
in the park?

17:03.857 --> 17:04.983
I don't know.
He's a dope.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.235
Oh, my God!
You're freezing.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.657
No, no,
I've never felt
more alive.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.535
Why are you
looking so happy?

17:15.660 --> 17:18.245
I was watching the sunrise
or a bum drop a twosie
on the jogging path.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.457
I realized something.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.251
I realized you guys
weren't coming,

17:24.377 --> 17:25.252
but it wasn't
because you didn't care.

17:26.212 --> 17:26.963
It wasn't?
No.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.050
No, it was
because you knew

17:31.175 --> 17:32.635
that I had to figure
this out for myself.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.345
Mmm.
Right?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.806
I mean, I'm an adult now.
I'm getting married.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.391
I can't always
rely on my friends
to bail me out.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.351
No, you cannot.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.022
You guys taught me
that lesson.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.400
That was the lesson that
we were intending to teach.
Yeah.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.820
Listen, we were talking
to Jen about this whole
"best man" thing,

17:50.945 --> 17:52.989
and it's not fair that you
have to choose between us,

17:53.113 --> 17:54.949
so what do you think
about having co-best men?

17:56.868 --> 17:57.744
Seriously?

17:59.037 --> 17:59.913
Seriously?

18:02.248 --> 18:05.001
Bros, you have no idea
what this means to me.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.503
Hey, I'm gonna buy
you guys breakfast...

18:07.628 --> 18:09.672
Right after
I thaw out my junk
under the hand dryer.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.889
RUSSELL: Hey, Timmy.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.850
Tidying up
the old work space.
I appreciate that.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.852
It was looking
a little Taj Mahal-ian here.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.312
(CHUCKLES)

18:25.438 --> 18:26.355
Yeah,
but I didn't say anything
'cause I'm the cool boss.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.987
All right,
are you still mad
that I chipped you?

18:35.073 --> 18:36.240
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

18:36.365 --> 18:37.992
I'm gonna make it up to you.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.786
Congratulations.
You're getting that
promotion you asked for.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.081
No, thanks.

18:43.205 --> 18:43.957
But it comes
with your own office!

18:45.165 --> 18:46.626
Pass.

18:46.751 --> 18:47.085
(IMITATING ACCENT)
Pass.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.257
All right, listen,
a couple weeks ago,
I needed you.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.634
Tried to get you
on your phone,
you weren't answering.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.219
I couldn't find you, and I...

18:57.344 --> 18:58.262
And what?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.015
You needed someone
to blow on your soup?

19:02.600 --> 19:03.935
Apply your ointment?

19:05.436 --> 19:07.105
Help convince
some unsuspecting girl

19:07.229 --> 19:08.439
that you're  thirtysomething's
Peter Horton?

19:10.524 --> 19:13.486
No.
Truth is, I panicked.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.155
And I started thinking,
"I don't know what'd I do
if you weren't here."

19:17.281 --> 19:17.991
You're about to find out.

19:20.034 --> 19:20.827
Good-bye, sir.

19:21.786 --> 19:22.912
Timmy.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.373
Tim! Come here.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.877
(EXHALES)

19:30.003 --> 19:31.129
Who's gonna help
convince chicks

19:32.505 --> 19:34.214
that I'm  thirtysomething's
Peter Horton?

19:41.139 --> 19:42.473
All right, you guys ready
to go to the movies?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.892
Uh, not quite.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.811
Well, it starts pretty soon.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.940
Oh, don't worry,
you won't miss the show biz
celebrity scramble quiz.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.900
This time, if the clue's
Indiana Jones,

19:53.026 --> 19:53.943
I know it's not
Harrison Dorf.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.487
All right,
let's get moving.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.197
Fine, let's go.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.490
Let me just take
a quick bath.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.076
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

20:02.201 --> 20:03.243
Oh, never mind. Get that.

20:07.915 --> 20:08.791
Adam.

20:10.001 --> 20:10.877
Kyle?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.089
What are you doing here?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.132
JEFF: I invited him.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.175
Found him on Facebook.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.761
Now, how do you two
know each other again?
