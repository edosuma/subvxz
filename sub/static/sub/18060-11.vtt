00:05.631 --> 00:06.632
Anastasia.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.967
You tossed me aside
like a piece of rubbish,

00:09.051 --> 00:10.219
all for a little red crown.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.512
What's this?

00:12.179 --> 00:13.514
My mother gave it to me.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.265
It always pointed me towards her.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.600
It's called a Lost and Found.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.684
(GASPS) Ooh!

00:17.768 --> 00:19.645
Jafar has released the Jabberwocky.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.897
He has Will, he has all three bottles.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.818

01:02.479 --> 01:05.023
Actually, not genie. Not anymore.

01:05.107 --> 01:08.610
Should I offer congratulations
or condolences?

01:08.694 --> 01:09.695
I seek neither.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.446
I'm here about the item
I traded you years ago,

01:11.530 --> 01:12.781
the Lost and Found.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.908
-Do you still have it?
-Ah, that depends.

01:14.992 --> 01:15.993
On what?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.161
On how much it's worth to you.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.621
It's worth a great deal.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.291
I, however, am worth very little.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.170
I was hoping we could come to

01:26.795 --> 01:28.172
an alternative arrangement.

(WHISPERING)

01:31.049 --> 01:32.217
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

01:33.051 --> 01:37.347
How about I give you back
your little compass

01:37.431 --> 01:41.852
in exchange for Alice
and the Knave of Hearts?

01:42.186 --> 01:44.021
CYRUS: What's your interest in them?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.564
They have an unpaid debt.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.651
Deliver them here
and the compass is yours.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.696
CYRUS: Bounty hunting
is not really my thing.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.824
And charity isn't mine.

01:58.660 --> 02:02.331
So I guess you'll be leaving
empty-handed, then.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.710
Not entirely.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.337
And how's that?

02:09.922 --> 02:11.507
You just bought me a drink.

Hey!

02:16.553 --> 02:17.804
That's my drink.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.223
You'd better pay for it.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.849
Put it on my tab.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.312
How about I put you on your arse, huh?

I've never seen magic do that.

Lovely.

Oh! Tomorrow's your wedding day.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.696
You're to be queen of this castle.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.074
It's I who should defer to you.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.744
Uh...

04:46.286 --> 04:47.287
Of course.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.335

that you accepted our invitation.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.504

05:00.300 --> 05:01.301
I didn't know that.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.763
(WHOOSHING)

05:07.391 --> 05:08.642
...threatening.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.481
The king believes
Royals shouldn't have magic.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.401
It separates us from our subjects.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.652
(CHUCKLING) Oh!

05:19.069 --> 05:21.530
I think a little separation's
a welcome thing.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.074
We queens have so much to think about.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.077
Why not use everything
at our disposal to help us rule?

05:27.661 --> 05:29.288
I guess I hadn't thought
of it in that way.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.372
(CHUCKLES)

05:30.455 --> 05:33.458
Perhaps you can help steer
the Red King to my point of view.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.546
You remind me of myself.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.507
I had humble beginnings, too.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.510
I see your potential.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.682
My own daughter's been
a disappointment to me.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.810
You're much more the kind
of daughter I'd choose to have

05:51.894 --> 05:54.563
if... (CHUCKLES)
If one could choose such things.

05:57.399 --> 06:01.403
And should you choose
to learn a touch of magic,

06:02.404 --> 06:03.822
I could teach you.

06:03.906 --> 06:06.283
And what the king doesn't know
won't hurt him.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.160
I appreciate the offer,

06:08.243 --> 06:12.831
(SIGHS) but I hardly think keeping secrets
is the best way to begin a marriage.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.792
(CHUCKLES) But it's a wonderful way
to begin a friendship.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.421
Perhaps another time. Thank you.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.508
Your Majesty.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.468
Well, my door is always open.

06:33.769 --> 06:34.853
Anything yet?

06:35.812 --> 06:36.813
No.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.400
But if my mother is indeed alive,
this should lead us right to her.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.861
Well, hopefully before the Caterpillar
realizes it's gone.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.365
The Caterpillar is the least
of your problems.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.957
-For what?
-To warn you.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.962
She was forced to make her wishes,
so now Jafar, he...

07:00.045 --> 07:01.797
He controls all three genies.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.425
Her Majesty wanted you to know

07:05.509 --> 07:08.095
so you could leave Wonderland
while you still can,

07:08.178 --> 07:09.221
save yourselves.

Tweedle, is there a way into the palace?

07:22.901 --> 07:25.571
There are secret tunnels
under the castle, but...

07:26.864 --> 07:27.865
I can show you.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.536
Guess this'll have to wait.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.621
There's something else.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.623
Jafar.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.294
He's unleashed the Jabberwocky.

then you already know.

I can't read your mind, Jafar,
only your fear.

you're doing something wrong.

Well, I closed me eyes,

-But you two, you're like that.
-The spell!

08:40.562 --> 08:41.688
You're resisting it.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.526
I want to know how.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.070
Why don't you let me

talk to him?

You think there's
something wrong with him.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.585
Let me get inside,

09:04.419 --> 09:05.963
take a look around.

Understand what?

09:46.211 --> 09:48.088

09:49.131 --> 09:50.883
There's something

09:50.966 --> 09:52.718
different about this genie.

09:53.677 --> 09:54.887
It's the Red Queen.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.059

of protection spell on him.

Hello, Ana.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.514
What are you doing here?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.016
I don't know.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.726

10:43.727 --> 10:45.646
look you in your eye
and ask you why you did it.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.025
-And what do you want me to say?
-That it's a con.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.985
That it was a play for the big prize.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.404
Marry the old man,
get the keys to the kingdom,

10:54.488 --> 10:56.073

through that mirror

-You have to go.

they'll throw you...

-You're worried. That means you care.
-Of course I care!

what's best for both of us!

for keeping you locked up like this.

as I am his.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.362
I don't know what you mean.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.616
You tricked me once
with a counterfeit bottle.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.202
Now this one
is not responding to my spell.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.082
I'm going to punish you severely
until you tell me what you've done.

13:55.377 --> 13:56.920
I've done nothing.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.966
And even if I had, I wouldn't tell you.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.515
What is wrong with him?

14:09.474 --> 14:10.475

14:13.145 --> 14:15.772

I've got your answer.

14:16.565 --> 14:17.900
(GASPS, PANTING)

14:17.983 --> 14:20.569
I know why this Knave
isn't responding to the spell.

14:21.570 --> 14:25.282
It's the same reason
why I couldn't read his fears.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.286
(GROWLS)

14:34.458 --> 14:36.043
He doesn't have a heart.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.426
You should know better than
to keep secrets from me, Your Majesty.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.638
It wasn't the Queen's fears
that gave it away.

14:49.765 --> 14:50.891
Then whose?

14:52.142 --> 14:53.936
We're not alone in this dungeon.

14:55.521 --> 14:56.772
You have guests.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.657
We found a secret tunnel system, sire.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.200
They must have escaped.

15:09.952 --> 15:10.994
Secret tunnels.

15:12.788 --> 15:15.123
I suppose you had no idea
about those, either.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.459
She knew about the tunnels.

15:17.543 --> 15:20.671
The king used them to bring his companions

15:21.129 --> 15:22.422
in and out of the palace.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.299
JAFAR: Hmm.

15:24.675 --> 15:25.843
Seems I'm not the only one

15:25.926 --> 15:28.053
who grew tired
of his partnership with you.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.515
All right, Your Majesty.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.101
You're going to help me find
the Knave's heart.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.144
I didn't know it was missing.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.022
How could I possibly know where it is?

15:41.233 --> 15:43.277
I'm afraid I'm of no value to you.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.444
True.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.532
But you may still be valuable
to someone else.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.034
(SIGHS)

16:02.087 --> 16:04.339
It was you the Jabberwocky
was sensing in there, wasn't it?

16:04.423 --> 16:05.716
It was like I could feel her...

16:06.466 --> 16:08.135
Picking me apart from the inside.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.972
And now because of me,
they know about the Knave's heart.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.391
(SIGHS) And I'm sure
it's only a matter of time

16:14.474 --> 16:16.351
before that thing
gets inside the Knave's head

16:16.435 --> 16:17.895
and they'll find out where it is.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.022
Well, there's only one thing
to do, then, isn't there?

16:20.105 --> 16:21.899
We figure out a way
of finding it before they do.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.026
Finding it isn't hard.
I already know where it is.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.861
-You do?
-Yes. The Knave told me.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.238
But getting there,
that's the challenging part.

16:28.322 --> 16:29.323
Why's that?

16:29.406 --> 16:30.991
Because it's not in Wonderland.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.249
Your heart, where is it?

16:39.875 --> 16:41.460
That's funny, I don't remember.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.795
And locking me down here
won't do you much good.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.464
I've slept in worse places than this.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.758
But have you ever slept next to a corpse?

Not really.

25:42.042 --> 25:43.043
Pity.

25:45.254 --> 25:46.505
What I see in you

25:47.923 --> 25:50.843
is a desire to make a mark in this world.

25:52.886 --> 25:53.887
(CHUCKLES)

25:55.305 --> 25:57.182
Someday, we'll all move on,

25:58.559 --> 25:59.977
and when we do,

26:01.270 --> 26:05.023
do you really want to be buried
behind some rickety wagon,

26:05.107 --> 26:07.359
not even a stone to mark your grave?

26:08.569 --> 26:11.405
Or do you want thousands to gather around,

26:12.114 --> 26:14.700
celebrating the glorious life you led,

26:15.951 --> 26:17.870
the life you were meant for?

26:18.412 --> 26:20.205
How can you be sure
that that's the life for me?

26:20.289 --> 26:22.040
(SCOFFS) Because you could
have been a nobody,

26:22.124 --> 26:25.711
but you chose to be a queen.
You chose power over weakness.

26:26.378 --> 26:29.464
Don't be shaken by the ravings
of that lovesick man.

26:29.548 --> 26:32.176
I'm sure he spoke well. They always do.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.052
But they were lies.

26:35.179 --> 26:37.264
Will is many things, but he's not a liar.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.518
He's waiting for me.

26:41.602 --> 26:42.603
Is he?

26:56.867 --> 26:57.910
I don't see him.

26:58.285 --> 26:59.369
Do you?

27:00.245 --> 27:02.331
You tossed him aside for a crown.

27:03.207 --> 27:04.958
Men don't forget a betrayal like that.

27:05.459 --> 27:08.629
He'll never trust you again,
and he will never love you again.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.214
It's already too late.

27:12.007 --> 27:13.091
No.

27:15.177 --> 27:16.220
It can't be.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.055
Oh.

27:19.890 --> 27:22.893
Perhaps all he wanted
was to ruin this day for you.

27:23.685 --> 27:24.811
(SIGHS)

27:24.895 --> 27:27.189
To embarrass you
in front of all your friends.

27:29.900 --> 27:32.861
This part of your story's over now,

27:34.488 --> 27:36.990
but a new chapter is just beginning.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.744
You can be a wonderful queen.

27:43.664 --> 27:44.957
Will you show me how?

27:45.749 --> 27:47.918
Oh, of course I will.

27:49.336 --> 27:50.420
(LAUGHS)

27:50.504 --> 27:53.298
I'll teach you everything
you need to know.

28:01.849 --> 28:04.309
-(GASPS)
-(GLASS SHATTERS)

28:05.811 --> 28:08.272
Yet another part of Will's life
I've damaged.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.482
You shouldn't blame yourself for that.

28:11.525 --> 28:13.652
If it wasn't for me,
the Knave wouldn't be in trouble.

28:14.403 --> 28:16.321
He'd be safe. He'd be happy.

28:16.947 --> 28:18.448
The only bottles he'd be worrying about

28:18.532 --> 28:20.993
-are the ones that had run out of beer.
-(SIGHS)

28:21.660 --> 28:23.537
And if he was, where would you be?

28:24.288 --> 28:27.416
You'd still be in that asylum,
and I'd still be in that cage.

28:27.499 --> 28:30.085
So he should suffer so we can be happy?

28:30.169 --> 28:31.670
No, but look around you.

28:32.171 --> 28:33.964
Does this look like
someone who is happy to you?

28:35.007 --> 28:36.508
He fetched you for a reason, Alice.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.678
Clearly, he wasn't the only one
who left someone in Wonderland.

28:43.473 --> 28:44.683
Anastasia.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.977
This is his fight, too, always has been.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.564
Now, you know Will
better than anyone, so think.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.900
If you were him,
where would you keep your heart?

28:55.360 --> 28:56.361
(SIGHS)

29:00.616 --> 29:02.868
Maybe with the person
that broke it in the first place.

29:10.709 --> 29:11.793
What are you doing?

29:40.447 --> 29:41.907
(HEART BEATING)

29:52.709 --> 29:54.503
You chose to be heartless. I...

29:56.129 --> 29:57.548
I never knew that.

29:57.631 --> 30:00.133
You can't ask a man to feel like that
for the rest of his life.

30:02.219 --> 30:05.055
You know, there's something
I've been dying to know.

30:05.722 --> 30:07.015
Yeah? What's that?

30:07.099 --> 30:09.351
You said you wanted Jafar
to change the laws of magic

30:10.102 --> 30:13.689
so you could do the impossible,
go back and change the past, our past.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.024
That's right.

30:16.275 --> 30:17.943
What part would you have changed?

30:18.777 --> 30:20.696
Would you have left
the old guy at the altar?

30:21.196 --> 30:22.823
Never said yes when he proposed?

30:24.116 --> 30:25.617
Never even gone after the crown jewels?

30:25.701 --> 30:27.035
Never come to Wonderland.

30:29.079 --> 30:30.789
We should have stayed in Sherwood.

30:32.749 --> 30:35.419
I wish we'd never set eyes
on that damn looking glass.

30:36.879 --> 30:39.756
Getting involved with magic,
that was the start of all our trouble.

30:42.134 --> 30:44.887
Anastasia and Will,

30:46.263 --> 30:48.724
we already had
all the magic we needed, right?

30:55.147 --> 30:56.356
That, they did.

31:01.195 --> 31:02.321
(SOBS, CHUCKLES)

31:09.870 --> 31:11.079
Now it's your turn.

31:21.757 --> 31:23.717
I'm sorry. I can't get it to light.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.303
Just keep trying. It'll come eventually.

31:27.304 --> 31:29.139
You make magic look so easy.

31:29.223 --> 31:32.142
It starts with a respect
for the power itself

31:33.602 --> 31:36.605
and then the belief
that you deserve such power.

31:43.570 --> 31:44.863
Can I ask you a question?

31:44.947 --> 31:46.240
(CHUCKLING) Of course.

31:46.323 --> 31:47.324
The magic,

31:48.408 --> 31:49.993
what exactly do you use it for?

31:50.452 --> 31:51.453
(CHUCKLES)

31:52.079 --> 31:53.413
To get whatever you want.

31:55.332 --> 31:56.416
Anything?

31:56.500 --> 31:57.584
Almost.

31:58.085 --> 32:01.755
There are a few restrictions,
the laws of magic.

32:02.673 --> 32:03.674
What are those?

32:05.092 --> 32:07.594
Things not even the strongest magic
can accomplish.

32:08.595 --> 32:10.138
You can't bring back the dead.

32:10.556 --> 32:12.182
You can't make someone love you.

32:12.599 --> 32:14.017
You can't change the past.

32:27.239 --> 32:29.241
Can the laws be broken?

32:29.324 --> 32:31.201
No. They cannot.

32:35.831 --> 32:37.666
You say you want to learn,

32:38.709 --> 32:40.794
but something's holding you back.

32:42.212 --> 32:43.463
You're afraid.

32:44.381 --> 32:45.716
What is it?

32:47.301 --> 32:48.468
I don't know. I can...

32:51.805 --> 32:53.849
I don't want the Red King
to see what we're doing.

32:53.932 --> 32:55.100
Why?

32:56.310 --> 32:58.312
Because I know he won't approve.

32:59.605 --> 33:00.772
Anastasia...

33:02.566 --> 33:04.818
You don't need anyone's approval.

33:06.403 --> 33:08.822
Whoever it was that made
you feel this way,

33:08.906 --> 33:12.034
that you are somehow flawed or unworthy,

33:12.951 --> 33:16.121
you need to take that pain,

33:16.496 --> 33:18.165
the fear that they were right,

33:18.790 --> 33:20.167
and use it.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.835
It's the root of your power.

33:21.919 --> 33:25.005
Let it drive the magic
and prove them all wrong!

33:29.593 --> 33:30.761
It worked!

33:32.721 --> 33:33.931
It worked!

33:34.014 --> 33:35.557
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

33:53.992 --> 33:56.995
I can't understand
why the king's so against it.

33:57.079 --> 34:00.874
Oh, I have a feeling you won't have
to worry about him for too much longer.

(WHOOSHING)

34:15.931 --> 34:17.057
(BOTH PANTING)

34:17.140 --> 34:19.852
We have the Knave's heart.
Now we just have to hide it.

34:20.477 --> 34:23.856
If the Jabberwocky can read our thoughts,
it has to be somewhere none of us know.

34:23.939 --> 34:27.067
That way, it remains hidden
no matter what they do to us.

34:28.235 --> 34:30.195
Okay, but how on earth do we do that?

34:34.449 --> 34:36.493
-What is it?
-The Lost and Found.

34:40.247 --> 34:41.373
Something's happening.

34:46.545 --> 34:47.963
It's found something.

34:49.882 --> 34:51.466
We should follow it and see...

35:03.729 --> 35:04.813
How helpful.

35:05.522 --> 35:07.608
You saved me a trip to this Storybrooke.

35:09.026 --> 35:10.611
The Knave told me all about it.

35:12.529 --> 35:13.530
Now...

35:14.573 --> 35:15.782
Hand over the heart.

35:16.992 --> 35:19.161
I won't do that, not ever.

35:22.247 --> 35:23.457
Have it your way.

35:33.634 --> 35:36.261
It was lovely
doing business with you, Alice.

35:37.721 --> 35:39.973
But now it's time
to say goodbye to you both.

35:43.268 --> 35:44.269
For good.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.522
Cyrus, no!

36:01.828 --> 36:02.955
Put that down!

36:04.122 --> 36:06.458
You shouldn't play with toys
that don't belong to you.

Stay back!

I didn't do anything.

36:54.673 --> 36:55.757
We failed.

Jafar has the heart.

36:58.385 --> 36:59.928
There's no stopping him now.

37:01.722 --> 37:03.140
I'm not so sure about that.

37:05.475 --> 37:06.643
Tell me what you see.

37:13.859 --> 37:15.235
The needle, it's following you.

37:15.569 --> 37:17.905
Is it following me or...

37:20.324 --> 37:21.366
(GRUNTS)

37:21.825 --> 37:23.243
...or is it following the staff?

37:33.462 --> 37:35.214
I don't understand. How is that possible?

37:36.965 --> 37:40.010
When Jafar tried to kill me,
the staff, it fought back,

37:40.093 --> 37:41.512
like it was resisting him.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.056
And this...

37:45.766 --> 37:47.893
My mother always said it would
one day lead me back to her.

37:48.894 --> 37:50.062
And now...

37:50.771 --> 37:52.731
She was always fascinated by serpents,

37:53.148 --> 37:56.985
how they were able to change, to evolve.

37:58.904 --> 38:00.489
Our house was filled
with renderings of them,

38:00.572 --> 38:02.032
with pictures, carvings.

38:02.115 --> 38:04.451
Cyrus, what are you saying?

38:05.494 --> 38:06.870
Do you think that she's...

38:08.038 --> 38:09.122
Do you?

38:10.832 --> 38:12.501
I know it's impossible, but...

38:13.335 --> 38:14.962
If there's a chance I'm right,

38:17.422 --> 38:18.757
then we free her.

38:21.260 --> 38:22.469
All right.

38:23.595 --> 38:24.805
Only question is...

38:26.557 --> 38:27.641
How?

38:37.025 --> 38:38.068
I'm sorry.

38:41.154 --> 38:43.115
Don't go getting all mushy on me.

38:43.198 --> 38:46.034
I'm sorry for resorting to magic
to try and win you back.

38:46.785 --> 38:48.871
The laws of magic are there for a reason.

38:49.329 --> 38:50.664
They're not meant to be broken.

38:50.747 --> 38:51.957
Neither was my heart.

possibly be able to forgive me?
