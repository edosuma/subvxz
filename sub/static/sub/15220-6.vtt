00:32.104 --> 00:34.524
and vanished.

00:38.236 --> 00:41.031
He woke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:41.031 --> 00:44.492
facing mirror images
that were not his own.

00:44.492 --> 00:48.705
And driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.

00:49.831 --> 00:52.042
His only guide on this journey
is Al -

00:52.042 --> 00:56.713
an observer from his own time, who
appears in the form of a hologram

00:56.713 --> 00:59.007
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:59.007 --> 01:03.178
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.178 --> 01:06.306
striving to put right
what once went wrong.

01:06.306 --> 01:08.975
And hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:10.185 --> 01:12.270
..will be the leap home.'

01:15.482 --> 01:17.525
(CHATTER)

01:22.447 --> 01:24.616
Open the window!

01:27.661 --> 01:30.163
I wish I could go with you, honey,

01:30.163 --> 01:33.708
but your daddy would go crazy if I
left him here alone with the twins.

01:33.708 --> 01:35.919
I'm just so darn proud of you.

01:35.919 --> 01:39.839
Oh! Wait. I almost forgot.
Come and get this stuff.

01:39.839 --> 01:42.175
Open that door.

01:43.843 --> 01:47.764
If you'd have forgotten this,
you would've looked pretty foolish.

01:48.431 --> 01:51.893
These are my favourite earbobs.

01:51.893 --> 01:54.729
It wouldn't do
for my baby girl to go off

01:54.729 --> 01:57.190
to the biggest beauty contest
in the South

01:57.190 --> 02:01.653
without her crown and her sash now,
would it?

02:04.906 --> 02:07.492
Oh, Darlene.

02:09.494 --> 02:12.414
Oh...boy.

03:44.214 --> 03:46.424
Yoo-hoo. Miss Sugar Belle.

03:46.424 --> 03:49.636
What in the name of heaven
do you think you're doing?

03:50.220 --> 03:53.848
I'm sorry? Well, you're never
going to become Miss Deep South

03:53.848 --> 03:57.936
moving like that.
Like...what?

03:57.936 --> 04:00.563
Like a...man.

04:00.563 --> 04:04.276
Oh, didn't anyone ever
teach you the proper way to walk?

04:04.276 --> 04:06.486
Was I doing it wrong?

04:06.486 --> 04:09.030
Not if you plan
on becoming a truck driver.

04:09.030 --> 04:11.783
Here, you watch me.

04:11.783 --> 04:17.329
Now, remember, we step and glide
and step and glide.

04:17.329 --> 04:19.624
And glide and step.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.461
All right? Now, you try it. Go on.

04:23.461 --> 04:25.797
You-you-you mean right here?

04:25.797 --> 04:29.259
Right now?
Well, you could try it tomorrow,

04:29.259 --> 04:32.178
but it might be a little late,
don't you think? Yeah.

04:32.178 --> 04:35.140
I suppose. Could I
ask you something? Of course.

04:40.186 --> 04:42.647
I'm also
a former Miss Orange Blossom,

04:42.647 --> 04:47.611
Miss Wisteria and second runner-up
in the Miss Praline Pageant.

04:47.611 --> 04:50.405
Which I would've won,
had it not been for the fact

04:50.405 --> 04:52.699
that one of my batons
failed to ignite.

04:52.699 --> 04:56.119
And, of course,
Miss Deep South, 1946.

04:58.204 --> 05:00.248
So?

05:08.256 --> 05:13.637
That's it now.
Step and glide and step and glide.

05:13.637 --> 05:15.764
Glide and...

05:17.641 --> 05:21.394
Well...you've still got 24 hours.

05:22.437 --> 05:24.606
Don't give up.

05:26.942 --> 05:28.985
(SIGHS)

05:32.322 --> 05:34.491
(BELL RINGS)

05:34.491 --> 05:38.119
WOMAN: Yoo-hoo. Can you please
hold the elevator? Thank you.

05:38.286 --> 05:40.330
(GASPS) Oh.

05:40.664 --> 05:42.958
Oh, I'm really sorry.

05:42.958 --> 05:45.126
I-I didn't see you standing there.

05:45.126 --> 05:47.212
Did I hurt you?
No.

05:47.212 --> 05:49.255
No, I'm fine.

05:52.759 --> 05:54.803
Oh. What's this?

05:56.596 --> 05:58.682
It's my little sister's.

06:01.518 --> 06:03.687
I'm Connie.

06:04.437 --> 06:06.564
Darlene.
Oh.

06:06.564 --> 06:09.276
That's quite a grip you got there,
Darlene.

06:09.276 --> 06:11.528
Oh.

06:12.779 --> 06:14.906
Oh, Miss Sugar Belle.

06:14.906 --> 06:17.284
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

06:17.284 --> 06:21.705
And...you're Miss Corn Muffin.

06:22.664 --> 06:25.375
It isn't that bad.
I wouldn't be here

06:25.375 --> 06:27.836
if hadn't been for this.
And believe me,

06:27.836 --> 06:30.171
I want to be here real bad.

06:30.171 --> 06:33.008
Well, this is all
kind of a new experience for me.

06:33.008 --> 06:35.176
Oh.

06:35.176 --> 06:39.597
Being Miss Deep South
would be a dream come true.

06:39.597 --> 06:42.684
It'd be an honour and a privilege.

06:42.684 --> 06:48.023
And I'd do my best to wear the crown
with pride and dignity.

06:48.690 --> 06:51.067
That didn't sound too rehearsed,
did it?

06:51.067 --> 06:54.070
No, no. It sounded...
It was very natural.

06:54.070 --> 06:57.616
Oh, good. You never know when
you might need to be spontaneous.

06:57.616 --> 07:00.493
Do you mind moving
your Little Miss Muffet stuff-it?

07:00.493 --> 07:03.747
Cute (!) You got your teddy bear
in there too?!

07:05.624 --> 07:07.959
Don't let her bother you.

07:07.959 --> 07:10.086
You know here?
I know the type.

07:10.086 --> 07:12.297
They're just bark.

07:12.297 --> 07:14.966
One thing to remember
about the beauty queens -

07:14.966 --> 07:17.636
it's a nice one
you've got to keep your eye on.

07:17.636 --> 07:20.013
Smile!

07:20.013 --> 07:22.182
Got it.

07:22.182 --> 07:24.225
Another candid pageant moment.

07:24.934 --> 07:29.105
I'm Clint Beaumont.
I'm pageant photographer.

07:29.105 --> 07:31.191
Hi, I'm Connie.

07:31.191 --> 07:33.401
Oh, this is Darlene.

07:33.401 --> 07:35.570
Nice to meet you.

07:35.570 --> 07:38.657
Have we ever met before?
Uh...I don't think so.

07:38.657 --> 07:41.701
Well, have you ever
been to Buford City?

07:41.701 --> 07:43.954
Buford City?
I think I'd remember that.

07:45.372 --> 07:49.292
Have you ever done
any print or runway work?

07:49.292 --> 07:52.337
Modelling? Oh, I wish.

07:54.422 --> 07:57.592
Be careful what you wish for.

07:57.592 --> 07:59.803
You just might get it.

08:03.348 --> 08:05.600
I'll see you.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.811
He kinda has a nice smile,
doesn't he?

08:07.811 --> 08:10.105
First of all,
I want to welcome you all

08:10.105 --> 08:12.691
to the 35th annual
Miss Deep South Pageant.

08:12.691 --> 08:18.071
Oh, it warms my heart to see
all your hopeful, optimistic faces.

08:18.071 --> 08:20.824
Remember, there are no losers here.

08:20.824 --> 08:24.160
Every one of you brings
something special to the pageant.

08:24.160 --> 08:28.123
Something unique. Something
none of the other girls have. Yeah.

08:28.123 --> 08:30.500
We have a lot to do.
Like jockey shorts.

08:30.500 --> 08:34.004
Very funny, Al.

08:34.004 --> 08:37.340
I'm a beauty queen.
Did I ever tell you about the time

08:37.340 --> 08:40.592
I had a fling with a beauty queen?
No, and I don't want to know.

08:40.592 --> 08:45.056
I was at flight school
and she was Miss Tail Gunner 1955.

08:45.056 --> 08:49.769
I tell you, she had
a major-league set of gun turrets.

08:50.854 --> 08:53.481
That was a compliment.
(On what planet?)

08:53.481 --> 08:56.192
Watch out.
You're going to ruin your chances

08:56.192 --> 08:58.653
of being voted Miss Congeniality.

08:58.653 --> 09:00.905
Just tell me what I'm doing here.

09:00.905 --> 09:03.158
Well, we're not sure.

09:03.158 --> 09:05.452
Ziggy's still running the program.

09:05.452 --> 09:09.789
Your name is Darlene Monte
and you earned your way

09:09.789 --> 09:12.250
into the Miss Deep South Pageant
by...

09:12.250 --> 09:15.003
oh, becoming Miss Sugar Belle.

09:15.003 --> 09:17.130
That's nice.

09:17.130 --> 09:20.550
And you come in third.
(I don't care about finishing, Al.)

09:20.550 --> 09:23.803
(I just want to fix whatever it is
and get out of here.)

09:23.803 --> 09:26.681
Well, just don't worry
and maintain a low profile

09:26.681 --> 09:29.392
and...nobody will pay
any attention to you.

09:29.392 --> 09:31.811
..learn a little more
about each other.

09:31.811 --> 09:36.024
(Keep a low profile? How can I keep a
low profile? It's a beauty contest.)

09:36.024 --> 09:38.777
It appears that Miss Monte
has a lot to say,

09:38.777 --> 09:40.904
so why don't we start with her?

09:40.904 --> 09:42.989
Miss Monte?

09:45.992 --> 09:48.620
What?
I ask if you'd mind standing

09:48.620 --> 09:52.082
and telling us what becoming
Miss Deep South means to you?

09:53.458 --> 09:55.710
Go ahead.

09:55.710 --> 09:57.921
Um...
I'll go and see

09:57.921 --> 10:00.548
if I can speed up Ziggy,
so hang in there, Sam.

10:00.548 --> 10:03.134
And remember, smile.

10:04.719 --> 10:06.888
Smile.

10:11.393 --> 10:14.479
Well, I don't really know
where to start.

10:14.479 --> 10:20.652
Uh...winning this contest
would be...uh...

10:22.070 --> 10:25.907
..well, it would be pretty darn nice.

10:25.907 --> 10:28.159
That's for sure.

10:28.159 --> 10:31.121
Could you be a little more specific?

10:32.455 --> 10:34.749
Specific? Oh.

10:34.749 --> 10:40.964
Well...um...being Miss Deep South...

10:47.971 --> 10:51.641
..would be like a dream come true.

10:53.184 --> 10:56.646
It would be
an honour and a privilege.

10:56.646 --> 11:01.651
And I would do my best to wear
the crown with pride and dignity.

11:01.651 --> 11:04.571
Well, that was very nicely put.

11:06.740 --> 11:09.075
Look, Connie, I'm really sorry.

11:09.075 --> 11:12.037
I didn't mean to steal your speech.
No, it's all right.

11:12.037 --> 11:15.123
You were just nervous.
Terrified is more like it.

11:15.123 --> 11:18.877
It's funny, isn't it? We just met
and we end up as roommates.

11:18.877 --> 11:21.588
Yeah. Sort of like
we were meant to be together.

11:21.588 --> 11:24.466
Uh...yeah, Connie.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.551
Funny, isn't it?

11:32.390 --> 11:35.060
(GASPS)
Would you look at this room?

11:35.060 --> 11:37.479
I've heard about places like this,

11:37.479 --> 11:40.398
but I never thought
I'd actually be staying in one.

11:40.398 --> 11:42.817
They even have a television set.

11:43.944 --> 11:46.196
Don't you have a TV at home?

11:46.196 --> 11:48.823
We got a radio.
And I go to picture shows

11:48.823 --> 11:50.951
in Chattanooga on the weekends.

11:52.577 --> 11:54.621
Here, here, here.

11:56.498 --> 12:00.210
TV: 'Mom and Dad don't want you
eating with your face on the plate.'

12:01.962 --> 12:04.214
'But there's nobody here.'

12:04.214 --> 12:07.384
(LAUGHS) I haven't seen
a black-and-white set like this

12:07.384 --> 12:09.719
since I was a little...girl.

12:16.518 --> 12:20.397
Connie...you said
that winning the pageant

12:20.397 --> 12:23.441
would be like a dream come true.

12:23.441 --> 12:27.696
'They make you learn etiquette.'
'What's that?'

12:27.696 --> 12:29.948
What kind of a dream?

12:29.948 --> 12:32.200
That kind.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.161
'I didn't know they picked on you
that much in high school.'

12:35.161 --> 12:38.331
'Yeah. They were real strict
about that kind of stuff.'

12:44.087 --> 12:47.299
(CHUCKLES)
You want to be the Beaver?

12:47.299 --> 12:50.510
No, I want to be on television.

12:50.510 --> 12:54.014
Or the movies. That's why I got
into this in the first place -

12:54.014 --> 12:56.308
to get enough money
to go to Hollywood.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.768
Hollywood is a long way
from Buford City.

12:58.768 --> 13:01.229
Don't get me wrong,
I love my family.

13:01.229 --> 13:04.524
It's just...my mamma's 36 years old,
she's got 8 kids.

13:04.524 --> 13:08.320
One's still in diapers and
the most exciting thing in her life

13:08.320 --> 13:10.905
is getting the new
Sears and Roebuck catalogue.

13:10.905 --> 13:13.575
I just don't want the same thing
to happen to me.

13:14.826 --> 13:18.330
Yeah. But why Hollywood?
We did this play in school -

13:18.330 --> 13:20.540
Our Town - I got the lead.

13:21.708 --> 13:25.170
And when I was on that stage,
I felt alive.

13:26.254 --> 13:29.341
Like I had electricity
shooting all through my body.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.093
You ever felt that way?
Yeah, once or twice.

13:32.093 --> 13:34.971
You know, getting
into showbusiness isn't easy.

13:34.971 --> 13:37.474
Neither is
watching the world pass you by.

13:37.474 --> 13:40.685
I may not make it,
but there's got to be more to life

13:40.685 --> 13:42.854
than kids and catalogues.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.528
What do think of him?

13:50.528 --> 13:52.656
Who?
Clint Beaumont.

13:52.656 --> 13:56.368
Oh, I...I don't know. He's OK.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.453
I guess.

14:01.414 --> 14:03.541
Why?
Oh, no reason.

14:03.541 --> 14:06.294
Oh, will you unzip me?
I want to try on my formal.

14:08.338 --> 14:10.382
Sure. Yeah.

14:10.924 --> 14:13.218
Sure.

14:13.218 --> 14:17.097
I'm so excited. (GIGGLES)
OK.

14:18.056 --> 14:21.184
Those zippers
were a brilliant invention.

14:22.852 --> 14:24.980
Buttons were OK, but...

14:24.980 --> 14:27.732
All right! In the bathroom.

14:33.488 --> 14:35.699
Al!
What?

14:35.699 --> 14:39.327
I'll be back out
in a couple of minutes.

14:39.327 --> 14:43.456
You know, you're really a prude.

14:46.751 --> 14:50.547
It's a good thing
I'm not here to win this thing.
She could be tough to beat.

14:50.547 --> 14:53.341
Well, don't start
writing her acceptance speech.

14:53.341 --> 14:56.970
Connie's the reason I'm here?
We don't have the details yet.

14:56.970 --> 15:00.807
She's not going to win, is she?
She won't be around to win.

15:00.807 --> 15:03.393
What do you mean?
Well, according to Ziggy,

15:03.393 --> 15:06.479
she doesn't even finish the contest.
So there must be

15:06.479 --> 15:10.108
something terrible happens
between now and tomorrow night,

15:10.108 --> 15:14.070
because she disappears
and no-one ever sees her again.

15:30.167 --> 15:33.588
All right, girls.
Let's try it one more time.

15:33.588 --> 15:36.090
Remember, lots of smiles,
lots of energy.

15:36.090 --> 15:38.342
Music...and step.
(MUSIC STARTS)

15:38.342 --> 15:41.596
Step. Step. Ball change.

15:41.596 --> 15:43.931
Good. That's it.

15:43.931 --> 15:46.142
Oh. Now, watch out
for those parasols.

15:46.142 --> 15:48.686
That's it. Now like ladies.

15:48.686 --> 15:52.648
That's it. And shuffle, shuffle,
shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.

15:52.648 --> 15:55.735
Parasols. Keep spinning.

15:55.735 --> 15:57.862
Keep spinning.

15:57.862 --> 16:00.615
That's it. And up.

16:00.615 --> 16:04.285
And sway. Keep swaying, girls.

16:04.285 --> 16:07.955
Keep swaying. That's it.
And No.1, go.

16:07.955 --> 16:12.209
Hi. I'm Cheryl Lynn Birch -
Miss Mason-Dixon Line.

16:12.209 --> 16:15.296
My goals are to become
a professional secretary

16:15.296 --> 16:17.423
and to have many children.

16:17.423 --> 16:19.550
No.2, go.

16:20.509 --> 16:24.222
Hi. I'm Victoria Jenkins.
Miss Confederacy.

16:24.222 --> 16:26.432

16:37.193 --> 16:42.031
And my goals include...my goals...

16:43.658 --> 16:46.369
..they include...
Stop! Stop!

16:47.245 --> 16:49.413
Is there a problem, Miss Monte?

16:49.413 --> 16:51.791
No. I just can't get my parasol...

16:52.959 --> 16:55.753
..closed.
Seems to be working now.

16:56.796 --> 17:00.550
I'll get it right the next time.
Well, there isn't any more time.

17:00.550 --> 17:03.094
It's time
for your pre-pageant interviews.

17:03.094 --> 17:06.097
Everyone, go back to your rooms.
I'll come and get you

17:06.097 --> 17:08.223
when it's your turn.

17:08.223 --> 17:10.351
Just...

17:10.351 --> 17:12.520
it jammed up on me and...

17:12.520 --> 17:14.605
How did you ever get here?

17:21.737 --> 17:25.156
(GIRLS GIGGLE)

17:25.156 --> 17:27.660
You see that? Even as a hologram,

17:27.660 --> 17:30.162
I've got it.

17:30.162 --> 17:34.208
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
Scarlett O'Hara on steroids?

17:34.208 --> 17:37.545
It's not working, Al.
I'm messing everything up.

17:37.545 --> 17:39.714
Oh.
Don't worry about it.

17:39.714 --> 17:41.841
You'll do great tonight.

17:42.717 --> 17:46.053
Yeah? I wouldn't bet on it.
I guess we ought to get changed.

17:46.053 --> 17:48.681
I'll catch up with you later.
Where are you going?

17:48.681 --> 17:51.475
Clint wants to talk to me
about taking some pictures.

17:51.475 --> 17:56.022
He says he knows some Hollywood
people. They want new talent,
and he thinks I'm perfect.

17:56.022 --> 17:58.357
When did this come off?
Before rehearsal.

17:58.357 --> 18:01.068
Darlene, this is just what I wanted.

18:01.068 --> 18:03.321
Wish me luck.

18:05.072 --> 18:08.409
She's gonna need more than luck.
What do you mean by that?

18:08.409 --> 18:12.371
Uh...I think you better sit down,
Sam.

18:14.290 --> 18:16.709
I think you'd better sit down, Sam.

18:24.634 --> 18:26.636
(SIGHS)

18:26.636 --> 18:28.763
I think you'd better stand up, Sam.

18:29.597 --> 18:33.976
Come, Al, just tell me
why she doesn't finish the pageant.

18:33.976 --> 18:37.855
Well, in about a month,
some photographs of Connie

18:37.855 --> 18:40.191
turn up on a calendar.

18:40.191 --> 18:44.237
The kind you see in the better
muffler shops across the country.

18:44.237 --> 18:46.948
Oh, come on, Al.
Connie's not the kind of girl

18:46.948 --> 18:49.158
who would pose
for that kind of a picture.

18:49.158 --> 18:52.036
People do a lot of things
when they're desperate.

18:52.828 --> 18:55.456
Clint.

18:55.456 --> 18:58.501
He takes the pictures, doesn't he?
Yeah.

18:58.501 --> 19:01.587
Yeah, and the poor kid -
when she realised

19:01.587 --> 19:04.549
what he was gonna do with them -
she got so ashamed

19:04.549 --> 19:06.634
she couldn't go home.

19:08.052 --> 19:10.179
I got to go find Myers.

19:10.179 --> 19:12.431
Why? What are you gonna tell her?

19:12.431 --> 19:15.935
That your holographic friend
told you about some photographs

19:15.935 --> 19:18.145
that haven't even been taken yet?!

19:19.522 --> 19:22.650
OK. All right.
I'm going to stick with Connie

19:22.650 --> 19:24.777
until the pageant starts.

19:24.777 --> 19:28.489
And then she'll still be here and
I'll be able to leap out. Mm-mm. No.

19:28.489 --> 19:31.784
Yeah, stick with Connie.
See, what you got to realise

19:31.784 --> 19:36.706
is that you use... I mean, Darlene
uses the money from the contest

19:36.706 --> 19:39.458
to go to college.
And she went on to become

19:39.458 --> 19:42.795
one of the first female
cardiologists in this country.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.173
So you have
to keep her chances alive,

19:46.173 --> 19:48.342
so she can come in third.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.888
She's saved a lot of people's lives,
Sam.

19:51.888 --> 19:54.098
So you keep your eye on Connie.

19:54.098 --> 19:59.478
But as far you're concerned...you're
Miss Sugar Belle.

20:01.397 --> 20:03.900
He sure can get me
a meeting with his friends.

20:04.942 --> 20:07.904
The movie producers?
They're not all producers.

20:07.904 --> 20:10.239
Some of them
are writers and directors.

20:10.239 --> 20:12.450
Will you tie me up?

20:12.450 --> 20:14.619
Tie you up?

20:16.287 --> 20:19.206
Oh. Oh, your hair.

20:19.206 --> 20:22.209
Ha. Yeah, I-I-I-I can do that.

20:22.376 --> 20:25.421
Clint says they're
starting a new picture next month

20:25.421 --> 20:29.258
and once they see the pictures
he takes, they'll be interested.

20:29.258 --> 20:32.053
How much do we really
know about this Clint guy?

20:32.053 --> 20:34.555
What do you mean?
Well, I mean,

20:34.555 --> 20:38.309
isn't it kinda strange that
he'd know all these big showbiz types

20:38.309 --> 20:41.354
and still be working here?
You think he's lying?

20:41.354 --> 20:44.565
I just think you should be careful.

20:45.608 --> 20:48.611
Darlene, Clint's just
trying to help me, that's all.

20:48.611 --> 20:51.197
Well, maybe
he's trying to help himself.

20:51.197 --> 20:53.366
You're jealous.
Jealous?

20:53.366 --> 20:56.035
That's right.
You can't stand the fact

20:56.035 --> 20:59.288
that he picked me and not you.
You know that isn't true.

20:59.288 --> 21:02.792
Do I? I should've known after
what you did at the orientation.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.419
I explained that.
You're just like the rest of 'em.

21:05.419 --> 21:07.880
Believe me, Connie, I'm not.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.800
Look, I know how badly
you want to change your life,

21:10.800 --> 21:13.177
but Clint is not the answer.
How do you know?

21:13.177 --> 21:15.263
Can you see the future?

21:15.930 --> 21:18.933
Connie, I just -
I won't spend the rest of my life

21:18.933 --> 21:23.104
scratching in a piece of dirt
and having ten kids
hanging from my skirt!

21:23.104 --> 21:25.231
I can't!

21:26.274 --> 21:28.401
Connie.

21:28.401 --> 21:30.570
Connie, wait.

21:31.487 --> 21:33.573
Connie.

21:34.782 --> 21:37.243
Well, just the person
I was looking for.

21:37.243 --> 21:40.371
It's time for your
pre-pageant interview. Right now?

21:40.371 --> 21:43.291
I mean, is it absolutely necessary?

21:43.291 --> 21:47.044
Well, yes. Unless you want to
throw away every chance of winning.

21:48.504 --> 21:51.591
So, uh...what are your measurements?

21:54.343 --> 21:56.470
Why?

21:56.470 --> 21:58.764
I beg your pardon?

21:58.764 --> 22:01.517
No offence, but um...

22:01.517 --> 22:04.228
why do you want to know
what my measurements are?

22:04.228 --> 22:08.107
Well, just because we have to know,
that's all.

22:08.107 --> 22:13.195
I don't see
where the size of a person's body

22:13.195 --> 22:15.865
has anything to do with who they are.

22:15.865 --> 22:18.075
I don't either!

22:18.075 --> 22:20.119
Philippa!
Well, I...

22:21.621 --> 22:24.707
Well, I don't.
Well, I -

22:24.707 --> 22:29.378
(LAUGHS) -
I suppose we can skip this for now

22:29.378 --> 22:32.632
and uh...if you'll just sign this,
we'll move right on.

22:38.596 --> 22:43.059
What is this? Just a standard
declaration of purity contract.

22:44.310 --> 22:47.647
Purity?
Nothing to get your back up about.

22:47.647 --> 22:51.400
We just want to verify the fact
that you are still a virgin.

22:55.696 --> 22:58.699
Great. Now, the people that I know,

22:58.699 --> 23:02.161
they're looking
for a particular kind of girl.

23:02.161 --> 23:04.413
A special kind of look.

23:05.498 --> 23:07.625
OK. Just relax.

23:08.042 --> 23:10.086
Ready?

23:10.795 --> 23:13.422
Good. Let's see.

23:13.798 --> 23:18.177
Why don't we uh...just
loosen this up just a little bit?

23:18.177 --> 23:21.472
What are you doing?
Relax.

23:21.472 --> 23:24.600
I was just trying to set the mood,
that's all.

23:26.644 --> 23:28.938
I-I don't know
if I should be doing this.

23:28.938 --> 23:31.107
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

23:31.107 --> 23:33.943
Connie, I'm going
to be very honest with you.

23:33.943 --> 23:37.280
I think that you can go to the top,
I really do.

23:38.322 --> 23:42.118
But you gotta give me
something in order to get there.

23:43.911 --> 23:46.664
What?
You.

23:48.749 --> 23:51.085
Now, you know what sells
in Hollywood today?

23:51.085 --> 23:53.337
Sex appeal.

23:53.337 --> 23:56.507
(LAUGHS)
And, honey, you got it.

23:56.507 --> 24:00.761
It's up to me to get it on film.
When those movie people
see pictures of you,

24:00.761 --> 24:04.390
they're going to be stepping
all over themselves to sign you up.

24:05.725 --> 24:08.895
But you're going
to have to help me out.

24:08.895 --> 24:11.022
Do you know what I mean?

24:15.943 --> 24:18.821
You-you want me
to take my clothes off, don't you?

24:21.240 --> 24:25.661
I want you to do
whatever you want to do.

24:25.661 --> 24:28.873
I got to tell you, if you don't,

24:28.873 --> 24:31.876
there's a hundred other girls
out there that will.

24:31.876 --> 24:34.170
So, what's it going to be?

24:35.296 --> 24:37.548
Are you going
to go back to Buford City

24:37.548 --> 24:40.176
and wonder 'what if'
for the rest of your life?

24:40.176 --> 24:43.262
Or do you want to see the world?

24:49.393 --> 24:51.979
That's lovely. Don't be afraid.

24:51.979 --> 24:54.065

when I first saw you.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.786
You won't regret this.

25:09.038 --> 25:11.207
Trust me.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.919

anything that will embarrass you.

Connie, uh...look,
I know you were upset...earlier

29:01.516 --> 29:03.810
and I'm sorry about that.

29:03.810 --> 29:09.524
But...I just feel like
maybe we should talk about things.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.571
Hey.

29:15.655 --> 29:17.907
Be careful, you're gonna shrivel up.

29:25.290 --> 29:27.334
Connie?

29:29.502 --> 29:32.797
Are you OK?
(SOBS)

29:44.517 --> 29:47.062
How are you feeling?
Stupid.

29:49.773 --> 29:51.941
How long were you in there?

29:51.941 --> 29:54.069
I don't know. An hour.

29:54.069 --> 29:56.196
Maybe more.

29:56.196 --> 29:58.531
I felt so dirty.

29:58.531 --> 30:01.993
I thought I could wash it off,
but I couldn't.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.291
He didn't...?
No.

30:08.291 --> 30:11.002
But it wasn't because he didn't try.

30:14.005 --> 30:17.550
So stupid.
It's not your fault.

30:17.550 --> 30:20.512
But you tried to warn me
and I didn't listen.

30:20.512 --> 30:22.847
I thought I could just do it
and forget it.

30:22.847 --> 30:25.141
What am I going to do, Darlene?

30:25.141 --> 30:28.770
Now, first off,
we got to get the film.

30:28.770 --> 30:31.398
Yeah.

30:31.398 --> 30:33.608
Maybe I could talk to him

30:33.608 --> 30:35.819
and ask him
to give the pictures back.

30:35.819 --> 30:39.155
Tell him I changed my mind.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.161
He's not going to use
those pictures to help me, is he?

30:45.161 --> 30:47.372
I got to get out of here.

30:47.372 --> 30:50.292
Where's my case?
Connie, Connie, stop it.

30:50.292 --> 30:52.877
I got to get out of here!
Connie, just stop.

30:54.796 --> 30:57.257
You can't run away
from your mistakes.

30:59.092 --> 31:01.261
Trust me, I know.

31:01.886 --> 31:04.848
I'll get the pictures back,
but you have to promise

31:04.848 --> 31:07.225
you'll stay and finish the pageant.

31:07.225 --> 31:09.394
Why are you doing this?

31:11.229 --> 31:13.398
Why do you care?

31:15.358 --> 31:17.444
Hey.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.239
We...

31:21.239 --> 31:24.242
we farm girls,
we got to stick together, right?

31:24.242 --> 31:27.996
Right.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

31:27.996 --> 31:30.582
It's OK. It's OK. It's all right.

31:30.582 --> 31:32.917
Who is it?
It's Peg Myers.

31:40.091 --> 31:42.510
Hi.

31:42.510 --> 31:44.679
Is everything all right?

31:44.679 --> 31:47.599
We missed you at
the talent rehearsal, Miss Duncan.

31:47.599 --> 31:50.268
Well, I was...
She's not feeling very well.

31:50.268 --> 31:53.730
I think it might be a better idea
if she stayed here and rested

31:53.730 --> 31:55.815
until the pageant starts.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.694
All right. If you think that's best.

32:00.946 --> 32:05.367
But I'll expect to see you in ten
minutes for photos by the pool. OK.

32:05.367 --> 32:07.577
In your bathing suit.

32:11.831 --> 32:13.875
Bathing suit?!

32:29.683 --> 32:31.851
Nice suit (!)

32:31.851 --> 32:34.104
Come with a bucket and shovel (?)

32:34.104 --> 32:36.272
They're all yours, Mr Beaumont.

32:36.272 --> 32:40.068
All right, ladies.
Let's take some pictures.

32:49.244 --> 32:51.288
That's good.

32:59.879 --> 33:03.883
OK, ladies, why don't you all relax
and we'll get individual shots?

33:18.565 --> 33:20.692
Pretty as a picture.

33:20.692 --> 33:23.612
Why don't we take some?

33:23.612 --> 33:26.156
I think you should
start with somebody else.

33:26.156 --> 33:28.992
Oh, don't worry. I won't bite.

33:30.493 --> 33:32.662
Just be yourself.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.873
It's all right.
Stand right over there.

33:37.208 --> 33:39.336
Good.

33:39.336 --> 33:41.379
Ready?

33:43.006 --> 33:46.760
(CHUCKLES)
Sweetheart, I can't get a good shot

33:46.760 --> 33:48.845
unless you cooperate.

33:48.845 --> 33:52.182
I guess some people
are easier to control than others.

33:52.182 --> 33:54.476
Well, I usually get what I want.

33:54.476 --> 33:57.145
Especially if
the girl's desperate enough.

33:57.145 --> 34:00.106
What kind of lies did you tell her?

34:00.106 --> 34:02.859
Why don't you ask her?
You can't just use people

34:02.859 --> 34:05.528
and expect to get away with it.
Who's going to stop me?

34:05.528 --> 34:07.739
You're looking at him.
Him?!

34:07.739 --> 34:10.992
Sweetheart, you're more confused
than I thought.

34:10.992 --> 34:15.746
Besides, I've already gotten away.
Maybe not.

34:15.746 --> 34:18.123
Give me the bag!

34:19.583 --> 34:21.835
What's going on here?
Ask him.

34:21.835 --> 34:24.797
She's lost her mind.
Give him the bag, Darlene.

34:24.797 --> 34:27.884
Ask him about the
private photo sessions in his room.

34:27.884 --> 34:30.261
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

34:30.261 --> 34:32.429
Just, please,
take a look at the film.

34:32.429 --> 34:35.308
This is insane!
You're not going to believe her.

34:35.308 --> 34:38.103
I don't care if you believe me.
Take a look at the film.

34:38.103 --> 34:40.981
It's your job to protect
the contestants, isn't it?

34:42.357 --> 34:45.193
Give me the bag.
What the hell are you doing?

34:45.193 --> 34:48.405
Would you wait for me
in the pageant hall, Mr Beaumont?

34:49.989 --> 34:52.033
Please.

34:55.829 --> 34:58.748
I'm sorry. 
I feel really bad

34:58.748 --> 35:01.251
about putting you
in the middle of all this.

35:02.043 --> 35:04.963
Not as bad as the person
on this film is gonna feel.

35:04.963 --> 35:07.090
What do you mean?

35:07.465 --> 35:10.552
If what you say is true,
the person in these pictures

35:10.552 --> 35:13.305
will have to be
disqualified from the pageant.

35:20.055 --> 35:23.809
At least stick around until the
pageant's over. It's already over.

35:23.809 --> 35:27.646
We can try and get the pictures back.
She wouldn't use them against you.

35:27.646 --> 35:31.525
I ruined things for myself. I won't
let you hurt your chances to win.

35:31.525 --> 35:33.819
Look, Connie -
Hey!

35:35.529 --> 35:37.740
One good thing
will come out of this.

35:40.117 --> 35:42.620
Clint Beaumont won't be around

35:43.008 --> 35:46.344
to ruin any more chances for -
(SOBS)

35:46.344 --> 35:49.764
- any dumb country girls,
too plain to see the real truth.

35:50.849 --> 35:52.893
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

35:54.352 --> 35:58.106
Put your hand up on your hip.
There you go.

35:58.773 --> 36:01.026
Don't go anywhere.

36:01.026 --> 36:04.529
My bus leaves in ten minutes.
So you'll get the next one. What...?

36:04.529 --> 36:06.656
Give me ten more minutes.

36:07.449 --> 36:09.576
All right.

36:09.576 --> 36:11.703
Stay with her, Al.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.830
Like white on rice, little darling.

36:14.956 --> 36:17.876
Why did you kick Connie out
and let Beaumont stay?

36:17.876 --> 36:20.921
Mr Beaumont has been
with this pageant for 12 years.

36:20.921 --> 36:23.006
He used her!

36:23.006 --> 36:25.842
She didn't have
to let him photograph her naked.

36:25.842 --> 36:28.720
What?!
She obviously went along with it.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.348
She made a mistake.
You sometimes do that at 19.

36:31.348 --> 36:34.476
You're avoiding my question.
Why is Beaumont still here?

36:34.476 --> 36:37.562
I won't change photographers
on the night of the pageant!

36:37.562 --> 36:41.733
You're ruining Connie's life.
Don't be so melodramatic!
Her life isn't ruined.

36:41.733 --> 36:45.654
What would've happened to you if
you'd been kicked out of the pageant?

36:48.657 --> 36:50.700
Oh, my God.

36:52.035 --> 36:55.914
You posed nude for him when you
were a contestant. Don't be absurd.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.668
How could you let him do that to
other girls after being through it?

36:59.668 --> 37:02.337
Or was posing naked your idea?
No.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.800
No.

37:08.385 --> 37:10.637
It just happened.

37:15.392 --> 37:19.271
First it was...'Let me
see some shoulder.'

37:20.856 --> 37:24.317
And then, 'Drop that strap down
a little lower to my shot.'

37:27.070 --> 37:29.990
And then it was,
'Just so beautiful.

37:29.990 --> 37:32.951
Don't be afraid. Just relax.

37:32.951 --> 37:36.621
I won't shoot anything
that will embarrass you.'

37:36.621 --> 37:38.665
(SOBS)

37:40.834 --> 37:43.295
And then before you realise it...

37:43.295 --> 37:45.422
you're naked and -

37:45.422 --> 37:47.465
(SOBS)

37:49.509 --> 37:51.678
- and it's all too late.

37:51.678 --> 37:53.722
(SOBS)

37:56.016 --> 37:59.019
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about what happened.

37:59.019 --> 38:02.355
Cos the pictures would be worth
a hell of lot more if she'd won.

38:02.355 --> 38:06.234
It doesn't matter. At least you
don't have my pictures any more.

38:06.234 --> 38:09.613
You...you don't have 'em?

38:09.613 --> 38:11.948
OK, I don't have 'em.

38:11.948 --> 38:15.243
You dog!
She wouldn't give it back to you.

38:15.243 --> 38:18.121
She would, and she did.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.290
Well, I don't believe you.

38:20.290 --> 38:23.126
Well, I'll send you
a copy of the calendar,

38:23.126 --> 38:25.337
in a month or two.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.380
Mr Beaumont.

38:28.340 --> 38:32.093
I'd do anything
to get those pictures back.

38:32.093 --> 38:34.304
Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:34.304 --> 38:38.141
Well, why don't we talk about this
over a drink? No, no, no.
In my room.

38:39.184 --> 38:42.229
Sam, Clint has taken Connie
to his room.

38:42.229 --> 38:45.315
The skuzz wants to make
a trade for the film. Trade?

38:45.315 --> 38:47.651
Trade?
Yeah, trade. You know, trade,

38:47.651 --> 38:49.986
trade, trade, trade. Room 318.
Hurry up!

38:55.242 --> 38:58.328
Just hang in there, Connie.
The cavalry's coming.

38:58.328 --> 39:02.415
Clint.
(SIGHS) Oh, not you again.

39:02.415 --> 39:04.668
Leave her alone.

39:04.668 --> 39:07.712
Who the hell do you think you are?
Her guardian angel?!

39:08.338 --> 39:11.049
I guess so. I'm sorry.
Was that your foot?

39:11.049 --> 39:13.218
Oh!

39:13.218 --> 39:16.346
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

39:16.346 --> 39:19.349
Yeah. Where did you learn to...?
Um...

39:19.349 --> 39:21.434
the 4-H Club.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.313
Oh, Sam, get the film.

39:27.023 --> 39:29.985
Where's the film?
Film? What film?

39:29.985 --> 39:32.404
The film.
Oh!

39:32.404 --> 39:34.906
Sorry, I didn't see you there (!)
I'm sorry!

39:36.741 --> 39:38.952
Oh, watch your head.
Ow!

39:38.952 --> 39:41.121
What are you doing?

39:41.121 --> 39:43.665
You're nuts!
Uh-huh.

39:43.665 --> 39:47.294
Where's the film?
It's under the mattress.

39:47.294 --> 39:50.714
Look under the mattress!
Crazy girl, let me in!

39:50.714 --> 39:52.757
You're gonna kill me.

39:52.966 --> 39:55.093
I got it.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.387
Oh, watch your head. There you go.

39:57.387 --> 39:59.389
There you go.
(GROANS)

40:02.642 --> 40:04.686
Here you go.

40:07.731 --> 40:10.859
Well...there's always next year.

40:10.859 --> 40:12.903
Not for you.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.450
I'm gonna see that you
never do another beauty pageant.

40:18.450 --> 40:22.037
You got too much to lose.
I've already lost.

40:22.037 --> 40:26.333
At least I can make sure no other
young girl makes the same mistake.

40:27.083 --> 40:29.878
Fire away. Peg, you're all right.

40:31.296 --> 40:34.216
Now, you two girls
better go and get changed.

40:34.216 --> 40:36.343
You have a beauty pageant
to finish.

40:43.850 --> 40:46.478
I can't believe this, Al.
Why am I still here?

40:46.478 --> 40:49.272
Relax. I had a look
at the judges' score cards

40:49.272 --> 40:51.691
and you're hanging on
to a solid fourth.

40:51.691 --> 40:54.778
Fourth?! I'm supposed
to finish third, aren't I? Yes.

40:54.778 --> 40:58.698
Third, I know. But you haven't
even started the talent contest yet.

40:58.698 --> 41:03.245
OK, we're in
a little bit of trouble.

41:03.245 --> 41:06.748
All we have to do is figure out
something else for you to do.

41:06.748 --> 41:09.209
What?
I don't know.

41:09.209 --> 41:12.420
I don't know. But whatever it is,
you got to go out there

41:12.420 --> 41:14.464
