00:40.912 --> 00:44.006
What a way to travel, eh? Barbaric.

00:46.050 --> 00:47.919
Horseless carriage, that's the way.

00:48.019 --> 00:51.978
I've seen them myself, you know.
Paris, London.

00:52.991 --> 00:56.518
London. That's where my business is,
buying and selling.

00:57.529 --> 01:01.625
The fact is, I got these
on my last stop here. Karlsburg.

01:04.001 --> 01:05.629
Pretty, isn't it?

01:07.305 --> 01:10.206
Six crowns it cost in Karlsburg.

01:11.109 --> 01:13.509
I can let you have one for three.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.176
Two crowns, then. I can't go any lower.

01:21.486 --> 01:22.748
Oh, well.

01:23.555 --> 01:24.715
Give.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.221
- Sorry.
- Give me.

01:29.827 --> 01:31.818
I should do as he says.

01:34.499 --> 01:35.796
One crown, then?

01:36.201 --> 01:37.225
No!

03:08.359 --> 03:09.348
God.

03:10.928 --> 03:12.896
Oh, my God.

05:23.127 --> 05:24.719
Dracula's blood.

06:01.632 --> 06:04.032
Where is that girl? Alice!

06:04.902 --> 06:07.700
- Yes, Father.
- All right, dear?

06:16.547 --> 06:18.777
It's a brisk morning, Father.

06:18.883 --> 06:20.407
Indeed, Jeremy.

06:23.488 --> 06:26.891
Isn't Alice's hat pretty, Mother?
It's a pretty color, don't you think?

06:26.991 --> 06:28.515
Come along now.

06:30.361 --> 06:32.163
- Mr. Hargood.
- Thank you, Vicar.

06:32.263 --> 06:35.824
- This was a very nice sermon.
- Did you think so? I hadn't planned it.

06:38.603 --> 06:40.662
Mr. Secker, good day.

06:42.039 --> 06:44.337
- Excellent service.
- Mr. Paxton.

06:48.546 --> 06:50.138
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:51.749 --> 06:55.453
- The Allens are having a party on Friday.
- I know, and I haven't been invited.

06:55.553 --> 06:56.918
You will be.

07:03.794 --> 07:05.227
When shall I see you?

07:10.334 --> 07:11.801
I don't know.

08:07.491 --> 08:09.550
You will stay here, Alice.

08:11.796 --> 08:15.199
You will apologize to your mother and I
for your behavior.

08:15.299 --> 08:18.462
- Thank you. You may go.
- For what behavior?

08:19.070 --> 08:21.873
You will apologize,
then go up to your room and stay there.

08:21.973 --> 08:24.108
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand...

08:24.208 --> 08:26.676
You know perfectly well
what I'm talking about.

08:26.777 --> 08:28.346
Mother, I don't understand...

08:28.446 --> 08:31.643
You were smiling and flirting
with that young man.

08:31.983 --> 08:33.717
But that was Paul, Father.

08:33.818 --> 08:37.116
I don't care. He is still a young man
and you are a young woman.

08:37.254 --> 08:39.484
A sexually mature young woman.

08:39.690 --> 08:43.352
I will not have you displaying yourself
in that provocative manner.

08:44.528 --> 08:46.664
It's because it was Paul, isn't it?

08:46.764 --> 08:49.824
You've never liked him,
but he can't help that.

08:49.967 --> 08:52.370
But you can help behaving like a harlot.

08:52.470 --> 08:54.995
- Papa!
- A harlot in God's house!

08:55.172 --> 08:56.407
Oh, my God.

08:56.507 --> 08:58.941
Blasphemy will only make it worse.

09:07.818 --> 09:10.719
It's only natural
in a young girl, William.

09:18.162 --> 09:20.596
Lunch will soon be ready, William.

09:21.799 --> 09:24.029
You may send hers up on a tray.

09:24.468 --> 09:26.231
And her supper, too.

09:27.104 --> 09:30.471
- Yes, dear.
- I shall not, of course, be in to supper.

09:31.642 --> 09:34.941
But I asked Cook to bake a ham
the way you like it.

09:36.347 --> 09:39.646
I am never in to supper
the last Sunday in the month.

09:39.850 --> 09:42.842
- Surely you know that by now.
- Yes, of course.

09:44.088 --> 09:47.057
- Your charity work in the East End.
- Exactly.

10:00.538 --> 10:03.439
Don't judge your father too harshly,
my dear.

10:04.608 --> 10:06.599
I know just how you feel.

10:08.012 --> 10:09.570
Do you, Mother?

10:10.214 --> 10:12.444
Well, of course I do, darling.

10:14.719 --> 10:17.244
I was young like you once, you know.

10:17.922 --> 10:21.380
Young and excited by the prospect
of my life before me.

10:21.826 --> 10:23.384
Until you met him.

10:24.795 --> 10:28.432
He crushed you, didn't he?
He crushed the life right out of you.

10:28.532 --> 10:30.659
You mustn't say such things.

10:31.001 --> 10:33.333
Well, he's not going to do it to me.

10:33.804 --> 10:37.103
- You're upset.
- With good reason.

10:38.275 --> 10:40.675
Mother, why does he hate Paul so?

10:41.011 --> 10:44.469
I've honestly no idea. No idea at all.

10:45.249 --> 10:49.242
- Is it something to do with Paul's father?
- Mr. Paxton?

10:50.488 --> 10:54.083
I don't see how it can be.
They scarcely know one another.

11:12.042 --> 11:14.067
Bit late tonight, Hargood.

11:14.345 --> 11:16.575
I am exactly on time, Paxton.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.755
Exactly on time as usual, gentlemen.

12:05.329 --> 12:08.059
I thought we were a little late, Secker.

12:16.407 --> 12:18.341
Hot potatoes.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.212
Sir!

12:53.978 --> 12:56.606
- This way, gentlemen.
- We know the way.

13:02.419 --> 13:04.387
Well, what have we here?

13:07.358 --> 13:10.261
Veronica, you look delightful.
Nice to see you again.

13:10.361 --> 13:13.262
Such a pleasure
to see you again, gentlemen.

13:13.464 --> 13:16.300
Punctual to the minute, as always.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.436
I have your usual room ready for you,
of course.

13:19.536 --> 13:22.006
I hope the entertainment
isn't too usual, Felix.

13:22.106 --> 13:26.410
No, I've selected something
most diverting for you gentlemen tonight.

13:26.510 --> 13:28.646
I'm sure it will amuse you.

13:28.746 --> 13:30.815
I've been getting a bit bored with it.

13:30.915 --> 13:33.918
You won't be bored tonight,
I can assure you of that.

13:34.018 --> 13:36.086
I think it's best
if you leave it all to me...

13:36.186 --> 13:40.424
because I know the girls who are
really clean, if you get my meaning.

13:40.524 --> 13:44.028
Some of the girls sent to me,
they've no idea.

13:44.128 --> 13:46.730
Straight into a hot bath they go,
and do they scream!

13:46.830 --> 13:49.099
They don't want to be seen
without their clothes on.

13:49.199 --> 13:51.902
I told them there's no point being shy
in a place like this.

13:52.002 --> 13:53.902
Here we are, gentlemen.

13:59.009 --> 14:01.111
Everything is ready, as you see.

14:01.211 --> 14:05.045
Here, let me take that for you. Thank you.

14:09.887 --> 14:14.483
That's right. You can't be too careful,
can you? Thank you.

14:17.261 --> 14:19.388
Here, let me.

14:20.798 --> 14:22.993
- Well done.
- Thank you, Felix.

14:23.767 --> 14:26.463
- Sir, there.
- Thank you.

14:27.805 --> 14:31.866
Gentlemen, may I be permitted to say,
"To your health"?

14:31.976 --> 14:36.072
And now, if you will excuse me,
I'll just go and...

14:36.480 --> 14:38.004
Well, you know.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.885
- Paxton?
- Yes, all right.

14:44.154 --> 14:46.315
- Secker?
- I don't think so.

14:51.962 --> 14:54.021
- Gentlemen.
- To your health.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.463
Ready when you are, gentlemen.

15:18.922 --> 15:20.446
Oh, my goodness.

16:24.154 --> 16:27.391
Why don't you stop pushing your way
in here and upsetting everyone?

16:27.491 --> 16:28.859
You're not wanted here.

16:28.959 --> 16:32.529
For God's sake, will you please go away
and stay away?

16:32.629 --> 16:34.153
Do you hear me?

16:36.400 --> 16:39.460
- Oh, darling.
- Sorry.

16:40.337 --> 16:42.635
No, not in here. I do beg your pardon.

16:48.378 --> 16:49.367
No!

16:52.116 --> 16:53.640
You can't go...

16:56.453 --> 16:59.456
You are not going in there.
Don't you dare try to go in there.

16:59.556 --> 17:02.389
They're some of my best gentlemen
in there.

17:03.127 --> 17:04.617
Bravo!

17:09.833 --> 17:11.391
Now, look here.

17:12.169 --> 17:14.738
- Yes?
- You can't come in here.

17:14.838 --> 17:16.203
But I have.

17:21.345 --> 17:22.880
Who's going to pay?

17:22.980 --> 17:27.109
My girls aren't free for any Tom, Dick,
or Harry, you know.

17:35.058 --> 17:36.548
Good heavens.

17:37.728 --> 17:39.355
Impudent young puppy.

17:39.730 --> 17:43.598
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
I can't begin to tell you.

17:43.901 --> 17:46.837
Yes. Well, get rid of these girls.

17:46.937 --> 17:51.208
No, Mr. Hargood,
I've got another lovely girl for you.

17:51.308 --> 17:54.835
- Get rid of them.
- Yes, of course. Come now, girls.

17:55.679 --> 17:57.579
That's a girl. That's it.

18:00.117 --> 18:01.448
Who is he?

18:01.552 --> 18:03.918
An impudent rascal, that's what.

18:04.488 --> 18:06.023
Yes, who is he?

18:06.123 --> 18:09.650
He's young Courtley. Lord Courtley, sir.

18:10.894 --> 18:12.361
You must remember.

18:12.462 --> 18:15.124
His father disowned him
several years ago...

18:15.465 --> 18:17.433
cut him off without a shilling.

18:17.668 --> 18:21.695
Found him celebrating black mass
in the family chapel.

18:22.973 --> 18:24.941
Very nasty, it was.

18:25.909 --> 18:30.403
- So that's young Courtley.
- Yes, terrible scandal it was.

18:30.847 --> 18:33.383
How does he live? Does he work?

18:33.483 --> 18:35.781
Him? Never a stroke.

18:36.119 --> 18:39.179
- Then how?
- They keep him.

18:40.424 --> 18:41.892
What, the girls pay him?

18:41.992 --> 18:45.723
Yes, they're fascinated by him.
He's the very devil himself.

18:46.163 --> 18:49.360
If I were religious,
I would say he was possessed.

18:51.969 --> 18:53.869
Possessed of the devil.

19:06.450 --> 19:07.781
Young man.

19:09.586 --> 19:13.357
If you're serving a writ, my friend,
please don't waste my time...

19:13.457 --> 19:15.482
or yours, for that matter.

19:15.759 --> 19:17.283
Lord Courtley.

19:21.298 --> 19:22.526
Do I know you?

19:23.467 --> 19:26.370
Of course, I took your woman from you.

19:26.470 --> 19:29.735
If it's to be swords or pistols,
I have neither.

19:31.108 --> 19:33.577
My friends and I
would like to take you to supper.

19:33.677 --> 19:35.879
- Why?
- We want to talk to you.

19:35.979 --> 19:38.072
- About?
- Over supper.

19:40.284 --> 19:41.615
Very well.

19:50.227 --> 19:52.627
- Driver...
- The Café Royal, driver.

19:53.430 --> 19:55.193
It's the only place.

20:11.548 --> 20:13.948
- May I come in, dear?
- Yes, Mother.

20:17.821 --> 20:20.585
- All ready for bed, dear?
- Just getting ready.

20:25.162 --> 20:28.825
- You've hardly eaten a thing, dear.
- I wasn't hungry.

20:33.937 --> 20:35.199
Mother.

20:36.573 --> 20:38.370
I'm so sorry for you.

20:39.376 --> 20:43.506
- Because I didn't eat my supper?
- You know it isn't that.

20:45.382 --> 20:47.111
I know it isn't, Mother.

20:48.051 --> 20:49.678
Don't worry, please.

20:57.027 --> 20:58.790
Good night, darling.

20:59.396 --> 21:01.125
Good night, Mother.

21:17.247 --> 21:19.545
Then let me explain it for you.

21:20.250 --> 21:23.620
You and your two friends here
have formed a little society...

21:23.720 --> 21:28.555
with the objects of enjoying
the more unusual aspects of this life.

21:28.959 --> 21:30.449
Is that right?

21:30.994 --> 21:32.296
That is quite right.

21:32.396 --> 21:36.266
At the same time,
keeping up a façade of respectability...

21:36.366 --> 21:39.358
in front of your families
and local community.

21:39.770 --> 21:41.260
Is that right?

21:42.472 --> 21:44.641
- Well, I hardly...
- I wouldn't put it like that.

21:44.741 --> 21:49.235
And having tried everything that
your narrow imaginations can suggest...

21:49.579 --> 21:52.707
you're bored to death with it all, right?

21:54.351 --> 21:57.054
And now you want someone...

21:57.154 --> 22:00.524
with infinitely greater experience
than yourselves...

22:00.624 --> 22:03.457
to suggest alternatives?

22:03.827 --> 22:07.957
- That's it exactly.
- Just how far are you willing to go?

22:09.199 --> 22:13.329
For instance, would you be willing
to sell your souls to the devil?

22:16.907 --> 22:18.842
What exactly do you mean?

22:18.942 --> 22:20.967
I mean exactly what I say:

22:21.411 --> 22:23.777
Sell your souls to the devil.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.313
- I don't know.
- Then we're wasting time.

22:29.453 --> 22:33.184
If one thought that one's experience
might be extended...

22:33.290 --> 22:36.282
It would be extended to infinity.

22:38.228 --> 22:40.097
What would we have to do?

22:40.197 --> 22:43.934
- First you will need money.
- Yes, I thought as much.

22:44.034 --> 22:48.596
No, not for me. To buy something
that we shall need for the ceremony.

22:50.006 --> 22:52.998
- What is it we have to buy?
- And how much?

22:55.111 --> 22:56.703
I will show you.

23:10.193 --> 23:12.095
Who else did you expect?

23:12.195 --> 23:14.664
Don't be silly.
Wait a moment and I'll come down.

23:14.764 --> 23:16.767
If you don't, I'm coming up.

23:16.867 --> 23:18.266
Don't you dare.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.548
- Come on, monkey.
- You'll wake them up.

23:51.034 --> 23:53.403
- Alice, nothing but good news.
- What?

23:53.503 --> 23:56.907
My uncle Harry will lend me the money.
I can go into business on my own.

23:57.007 --> 24:01.444
So, my darling, there's absolutely nothing
to stop us getting away.

24:02.746 --> 24:05.874
So when is it to be? This week? Tomorrow?

24:06.883 --> 24:08.077
Really.

24:09.753 --> 24:11.555
You don't mean that, do you?

24:11.655 --> 24:13.646
- Mean it?
- About tomorrow?

24:14.658 --> 24:16.319
What's to stop us?

24:19.262 --> 24:21.662
Well, I can't just leave them.

24:23.033 --> 24:25.001
- Not like that.
- Why not?

24:25.835 --> 24:28.305
You've told me often enough
how he treats you...

24:28.405 --> 24:31.808
how you long to get away. He'll never
agree to let us meet any other way.

24:31.908 --> 24:34.978
- But my mother...
- She married him, didn't she?

24:35.078 --> 24:36.947
She chose to be his wife.

24:37.047 --> 24:38.815
She's also my mother.

24:38.915 --> 24:41.349
I can't just run away and leave her.

24:42.752 --> 24:43.912
I see.

24:45.855 --> 24:49.313
So it was all just talk,
about our going away.

24:50.527 --> 24:53.360
No, it wasn't just all talk, Paul.

24:54.598 --> 24:56.566
I love you, really I do.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.896
I've said I want to marry you and I do.

25:00.203 --> 25:03.073
I want it more than anything
in this world.

25:03.173 --> 25:05.471
And if it was anything else...

25:08.645 --> 25:11.944
If I left her, Paul, I think she'd die.

25:13.717 --> 25:15.810
So what are we going to do?

25:17.220 --> 25:19.620
I don't know.

25:21.091 --> 25:24.390
Paul, never stop loving me. Never.

25:33.370 --> 25:34.928
Where are you, Weller?

25:35.939 --> 25:37.406
Who wants me?

25:39.509 --> 25:41.033
It's you, is it?

25:41.378 --> 25:43.947
Come on out, you old fool.
We've business to discuss.

25:44.047 --> 25:46.182
What sort of business
can you have with me?

25:46.282 --> 25:48.147
I want to buy, Weller.

25:48.818 --> 25:51.048
You? Buy?

25:53.556 --> 25:55.922
- Buy what?
- You know what.

25:57.727 --> 25:59.126
It's not for sale.

26:00.363 --> 26:03.166
- You'll sell anything for money.
- Money? What money?

26:03.266 --> 26:05.802
Would you please tell us
what this is all about?

26:05.902 --> 26:08.370
- Quite.
- You say the price, Weller.

26:08.638 --> 26:11.106
- More than you can afford.
- Granted.

26:12.409 --> 26:15.139
But it's these gentlemen who are buying.

26:15.345 --> 26:17.779
- What's that?
- Buying what exactly?

26:20.850 --> 26:22.215
Is it true?

26:24.754 --> 26:26.790
- You want to buy?
- Possibly...

26:26.890 --> 26:30.121
if we knew what it was
we're supposed to be buying.

26:31.061 --> 26:32.824
- Don't you know?
- No.

26:34.531 --> 26:36.192
Show them, Weller.

27:51.207 --> 27:52.572
The master.

28:01.518 --> 28:03.420
Courtley, what is all this about?

28:03.520 --> 28:07.257
- A concentration of evil, my dear sirs.
- A what?

28:07.357 --> 28:10.724
These pieces belong
to the most evil man of all time:

28:12.328 --> 28:13.818
Count Dracula.

28:19.102 --> 28:21.905
You'll know that I tell the truth
when I so describe him:

28:22.005 --> 28:24.473
His cloak, his signet ring...

28:25.642 --> 28:27.041
his clasp.

28:32.348 --> 28:34.509
- And his blood.
- His blood?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.051
His blood.

28:40.256 --> 28:42.724
But it's just powder.

28:45.061 --> 28:47.597
That's right, gentlemen. It's only powder.

28:47.697 --> 28:48.686
No!

28:49.098 --> 28:52.769
These relics will enable us
to perform the ceremonies I spoke about.

28:52.869 --> 28:55.739
- I'm asking you to buy them.
- Just on your word?

28:55.839 --> 28:57.739
Just on my word!

28:58.541 --> 28:59.701
I see.

29:02.445 --> 29:04.106
What is the price?

29:07.317 --> 29:09.217
1,000 guineas.

29:10.019 --> 29:12.886
- What?
- You'll never regret it, I swear.

29:14.257 --> 29:16.623
I swear in his name.

29:26.169 --> 29:27.203
For all we know...

29:27.303 --> 29:30.240
Do I take it that you do not want
to remain in the circle?

29:30.340 --> 29:31.534
No.

29:33.009 --> 29:34.340
Very well.

29:35.311 --> 29:36.801
We'll pay the price.

29:37.013 --> 29:40.176
You will be repaid a thousand times.

29:41.184 --> 29:43.914
And may the devil take good care of you.

31:00.997 --> 31:02.487
It's this way.

31:59.655 --> 32:01.054
There it is.

33:07.857 --> 33:11.054
- My God, I don't like this.
- Do you want to leave?

33:11.761 --> 33:13.956
- No, of course not.
- Then keep quiet.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.168
- What's that?
- Keep quiet.

33:22.438 --> 33:24.030
There's someone there.

33:27.143 --> 33:28.804
There's something there.

33:30.713 --> 33:32.442
Of course I'm here.

33:34.283 --> 33:36.683
Did you not expect me to be here?

33:37.320 --> 33:41.313
- That was a damned fool thing to do.
- Possibly, but it amused me.

33:41.757 --> 33:44.021
- You have the casket?
- Yes.

33:44.327 --> 33:47.262
Let's not waste any more time.
Bring it here.

33:55.404 --> 33:56.666
On there.

34:42.685 --> 34:45.620
The goblets! You brought them?

34:46.322 --> 34:47.983
Yes, they're here.

35:06.943 --> 35:08.205
Good.

35:48.517 --> 35:49.882
Hark, ye...

35:51.287 --> 35:53.380
O ye timeless ones...

35:54.257 --> 35:58.284
ye elementals of the earth,
and of the air...

35:58.661 --> 36:01.459
and of fire, and of water.

36:01.731 --> 36:06.668
In the most august dread
of the supreme Prince of Darkness...

36:08.537 --> 36:12.132
and of his archangels
and angels of darkness...

36:12.908 --> 36:14.500
and his legions...

36:15.278 --> 36:19.339
draw near and do my bidding, I command!

39:10.119 --> 39:12.314
Now will you believe?

39:14.790 --> 39:16.121
Now drink.

39:21.063 --> 39:23.497
Did you not hear me? I said drink.

39:24.233 --> 39:26.098
Drink! Do you hear me?

39:27.837 --> 39:29.805
Don't insult the master!

39:30.473 --> 39:32.941
- I can't.
- Drink, damn you!

39:37.146 --> 39:38.204
You!

39:39.114 --> 39:40.274
Drink!

39:48.657 --> 39:50.249
You fools.

39:50.659 --> 39:53.651
You pathetic, spineless fools.

39:53.996 --> 39:58.126
You drink then! You drink it!
You drink the filth!

40:30.733 --> 40:32.462
Help me!

41:02.331 --> 41:03.662
He's dead.

42:23.312 --> 42:25.974
- What do you want?
- William, what is it?

42:27.650 --> 42:30.084
Now listen carefully.

42:31.186 --> 42:33.622
I was at home here all evening,
do you understand?

42:33.722 --> 42:36.316
- At home here?
- Yes, here.

42:37.626 --> 42:40.356
- Can't you understand that?
- Yes, but...

42:40.996 --> 42:42.361
If anybody asks.

42:42.464 --> 42:44.762
- But who could ask?
- Anybody!

42:45.601 --> 42:47.831
- Do you understand?
- Yes, dear.

42:49.238 --> 42:50.330
Good.

42:58.013 --> 43:00.140
- Where's Alice?
- In her room.

43:01.316 --> 43:03.752
You'd better tell her to do the same.

43:03.852 --> 43:06.221
Yes, I'll tell her,
but she's a headstrong girl.

43:06.321 --> 43:08.346
I'll tell her myself then!

43:09.692 --> 43:11.819
You'll tell me what, Father?

43:12.161 --> 43:14.789
Listen, Alice. Now listen carefully.

43:15.364 --> 43:18.731
I was at home here all evening.
Do you understand me?

43:21.804 --> 43:24.466
- Yes, I understand.
- Good.

43:25.407 --> 43:27.136
Now go back to bed.

43:28.811 --> 43:29.812
Both of you.

43:29.912 --> 43:31.641
- Are you sure...
- Go!

43:42.424 --> 43:45.985
- Won't you tell me what's wrong?
- No! Never.

43:46.762 --> 43:47.922
Never.

44:59.001 --> 45:01.469
They have destroyed my servant.

45:03.772 --> 45:06.070
They will be destroyed.

45:14.416 --> 45:15.784
- Come on, Jeremy!
- Come on, Lucy!

45:15.884 --> 45:17.987
Come through on the inside! That's it.

45:18.087 --> 45:20.089
- Come on, Jeremy!
- Come on, Lucy!

45:20.189 --> 45:22.024
Come through on the inside.

45:22.124 --> 45:24.319
I won! Jeremy let me win.

45:24.626 --> 45:28.030
- No, it's not true. I didn't.
- Yes, you did, but I don't care.

45:28.130 --> 45:30.132
I'd rather cheat and win,
than not win at all.

45:30.232 --> 45:32.792
- There, isn't that honest of me?
- Very.

45:33.268 --> 45:35.998
Well, isn't anybody going to notice?

45:36.138 --> 45:39.130
- Notice? What? Where?
- No, look.

45:39.975 --> 45:41.602
Your ring.

45:41.710 --> 45:44.508
Isn't it beautiful? Jeremy gave it to me.

45:44.780 --> 45:47.408
- We're engaged.
- Does your father know?

45:48.050 --> 45:49.485
No, of course not.

45:49.585 --> 45:53.155
- You can't talk to him these days.
- Father's not very well, anyway.

45:53.255 --> 45:55.724
- I am sorry.
- Come on, let's go home.

45:55.824 --> 45:58.394
Alice has seen my ring,
and she is green with envy.

45:58.494 --> 46:00.291
That's all I came out for.

46:04.666 --> 46:06.035
I'll race you home.

46:06.135 --> 46:09.127
Alice, what are you wearing
to the Allens' party on Friday?

46:09.605 --> 46:11.306
My primrose, I think.

46:11.406 --> 46:13.271
Good, that won't clash with my blue.

46:13.609 --> 46:17.179
- Jeremy, what are you wearing?
- My pink, I think.

46:17.279 --> 46:19.975
Ripping! It won't clash with my yellow.

46:20.616 --> 46:23.050
Are you ready? Good. Go.

46:23.185 --> 46:25.380
We'll see you both on Friday.

46:35.564 --> 46:39.022
I'm sorry about your father, Paul.
Is it serious?

46:39.835 --> 46:41.302
Nobody knows.

46:41.804 --> 46:44.440
He came home the other night,
went straight to bed...

46:44.540 --> 46:46.269
and he hasn't moved since.

46:46.508 --> 46:49.238
He won't see a doctor,
he won't see anyone.

46:49.611 --> 46:52.603
My father's been acting
rather strangely, too.

46:53.649 --> 46:55.117
He's been drinking heavily.

46:55.217 --> 46:57.981
And that makes it even worse
for your mother.

46:59.188 --> 47:00.587
And for us.

47:02.658 --> 47:05.923
I'm sorry, Paul.
What's wrong with everybody?

48:03.585 --> 48:05.246
Mother, have you...

48:07.356 --> 48:10.025
I'm sorry, I thought Mother was in here.
Excuse me.

48:10.125 --> 48:11.615
Just a minute.

48:18.233 --> 48:21.066
I see from your dress
you intend going out.

48:21.436 --> 48:23.870
Yes, Father, to the Allens' party.

48:24.072 --> 48:26.008
I wasn't told about this.

48:26.108 --> 48:28.133
I would've told you, only...

48:28.310 --> 48:29.641
Only what?

48:32.381 --> 48:35.680
You haven't been very approachable lately,
have you?

48:36.184 --> 48:38.584
I mean, you haven't been quite yourself.

48:38.720 --> 48:42.121
You think I've been drinking too much,
is that what you mean?

48:43.325 --> 48:46.021
- Is that it? Is that what you mean?
- Yes.

48:46.929 --> 48:48.226
Yes, Father.

48:49.031 --> 48:50.191
I see.

48:54.770 --> 48:57.102
Who is taking you to this party?

48:58.273 --> 49:00.468
- Paul.
- I forbid it.

49:04.313 --> 49:07.578
- I forbid it. Go and get those things off.
- But...

49:49.891 --> 49:51.586
Good evening, Mr. Paxton.

49:52.060 --> 49:55.430
My daughter will not be coming
to the party. So you can go.

49:55.530 --> 49:58.328
- May I ask why not, sir?
- No, you may not.

49:59.601 --> 50:02.434
- Is she ill?
- No, she's perfectly well, thank you.

50:02.571 --> 50:06.029
It is just my wish
that she should not go out this evening.

50:07.142 --> 50:08.473
Excuse me.

50:15.851 --> 50:19.121
May I ask you one more question?
I think I have the right.

50:19.221 --> 50:22.850
Why do you hate me?
What is it I've done to offend you?

50:23.425 --> 50:26.528
You don't have to do anything
to offend me, young man.

50:26.628 --> 50:27.890
Drive on!

51:01.263 --> 51:03.356
Coming to the party, Alice?

51:03.465 --> 51:05.933
I can't. Father won't let me.

51:06.535 --> 51:10.301
I said, are you coming
to the party, Alice?

51:12.174 --> 51:13.732
Just give me a moment.

51:44.239 --> 51:47.976
As to the place where it happened,
I have been making discreet inquiries...

51:48.076 --> 51:51.580
and have ascertained, as far as I am able,
that no one ever goes there.

51:51.680 --> 51:55.650
So, short of one or all of us
returning there...

51:55.750 --> 51:56.774
No.

51:58.220 --> 52:01.587
No, I must confess
I should not relish such a journey myself.

52:01.690 --> 52:03.892
Short of us going
and seeing for ourselves...

52:03.992 --> 52:07.758
I think we can safely assume
that the body will remain where it is...

52:08.096 --> 52:11.122
until either it rots,
or is discovered by some tramp...

52:11.299 --> 52:13.733
who is unlikely to give the alarm.

52:16.638 --> 52:18.606
What you're saying is...

52:19.407 --> 52:21.376
it looks like we've got away with it.

52:21.476 --> 52:24.502
As you say,
it looks as though we've got away with it.

52:24.646 --> 52:26.915
All that remains is for us to establish...

52:27.015 --> 52:29.718
that none of us were away
from our homes that evening.

52:29.818 --> 52:32.685
I understand it is
what the police call an alibi.

52:33.588 --> 52:35.055
That is quite right.

52:35.524 --> 52:38.427
- Well, if there is nothing else...
- No.

52:38.527 --> 52:41.630
Then I shall declare that,
not only is this meeting closed...

52:41.730 --> 52:43.823
but that it never occurred.

52:44.032 --> 52:45.124
Good.

52:56.344 --> 52:58.812
- You'd better keep an eye on him.
- An eye?

52:59.114 --> 53:02.208
Yes, on his drinking.
It might loosen his tongue.

53:02.584 --> 53:03.846
I'll try.

53:40.055 --> 53:42.182
I did enjoy the party, Paul.

53:48.964 --> 53:50.693
I must go in, Paul.

54:03.211 --> 54:05.611
- Good night, darling.
- I love you.

54:25.367 --> 54:26.561
Father.

54:29.971 --> 54:31.734
I went to the party.

54:44.753 --> 54:47.381
With Paul. Father, I love him.

54:48.690 --> 54:50.851
- I know it was wrong of me.
- Yes.

54:52.027 --> 54:53.824
It was wrong of you.

54:54.095 --> 54:56.965
- I'm sorry, Father.
- And you're going to be punished for it.

54:57.065 --> 55:00.523
- Father, I've said I'm sorry.
- I'm going to punish you.

55:03.571 --> 55:05.698
I'm going to whip you, Alice.

55:06.041 --> 55:07.565
Don't touch me.

55:08.743 --> 55:11.109
Whip you, Alice.

55:11.546 --> 55:14.879
- Please don't touch me.
- And I haven't beaten you...

55:16.651 --> 55:18.846
since you were a little girl...

55:19.421 --> 55:20.752
have I, Alice?

55:21.656 --> 55:22.987
Let me go!

55:26.094 --> 55:28.824
If you touch me, Father,
I'll never forgive you.

55:50.585 --> 55:51.984
Paul, it's...

56:00.895 --> 56:02.294
Who are you?

56:04.599 --> 56:06.294
How do you know my name?

57:55.410 --> 57:56.741
Come here.

57:59.147 --> 58:00.910
Damn you, come here!

58:05.787 --> 58:08.312
Alice, you're going to be whipped.

58:09.057 --> 58:11.821
Whipped, do you hear me? Whipped.

58:17.098 --> 58:18.166
Now.

58:18.266 --> 58:19.824
Whipped, do you hear me?

58:45.126 --> 58:47.151
The first.

58:49.564 --> 58:51.191
It's nasty, that.

58:51.900 --> 58:55.103
Very nasty. It's nasty, Evans.
Get it cleared up, will you?

58:55.203 --> 58:56.192
Yes, sir.

59:12.554 --> 59:13.714
Hello.

59:14.322 --> 59:18.452
I just came to see the lady of the house,
sir, about him out there.

59:18.860 --> 59:22.831
Mrs. Hargood is suffering from shock.
I'm Paul Paxton. My sister's with her.

59:22.931 --> 59:25.433
Perhaps I'd better come back
some other time, sir.

59:25.533 --> 59:28.069
We can't do very much
for him out there, can we?

59:28.169 --> 59:30.171
Except take him out of the flower beds.

59:30.271 --> 59:32.607
But what about his daughter,
Alice Hargood?

59:32.707 --> 59:34.800
She been done in, too, sir?

59:35.076 --> 59:37.340
God knows, but she's missing.

59:38.046 --> 59:40.139
- Only missing.
- Only?

59:42.450 --> 59:44.714
Yes, since last night.

59:45.219 --> 59:47.687
- Is she a young girl, sir?
- Yes.

59:48.156 --> 59:50.522
- Trouble in the home?
- Yes.

59:51.092 --> 59:53.895
Familiar story, sir.
I won't keep you any longer.

59:53.995 --> 59:56.397
But what are you going to do about her?

59:56.497 --> 59:58.333
What do you want me to do about her?

59:58.433 --> 01:00:01.569
Issue a description. Send her picture
to all your police stations.

01:00:01.669 --> 01:00:05.807
My dear sir, if we were to do that with
every young girl that runs from home...

01:00:05.907 --> 01:00:07.642
we wouldn't have time for anything else.

01:00:07.742 --> 01:00:12.076
- She has not run away.
- How do you know that, sir?

01:00:13.081 --> 01:00:17.381
- I just know it!
- I see, sir. You just know it.

01:00:17.518 --> 01:00:21.055
I'm sure you have other things
to attend to, like me, sir.

01:00:21.155 --> 01:00:24.682
- So if you'll excuse me.
- Look, it's a raw morning.

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:28.819
I'm sure Mrs. Hargood wouldn't want you
to leave without a little refreshment.

01:00:29.197 --> 01:00:32.166
I won't while I'm on duty, sir.
Good morning.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.996
Evans, you got that mess cleared up
outside there yet?

01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:44.008
"We beseech thee, O Father,
to raise us from the death of sin...

01:00:44.112 --> 01:00:48.082
"unto the life of righteousness,
that when we shall depart this life...

01:00:48.182 --> 01:00:52.175
"we may rest in him,
as our hope is this our brother doth...

01:00:52.353 --> 01:00:55.323
"and that at the general resurrection
in the last day...

01:00:55.423 --> 01:01:00.028
"we may be found acceptable in thy sight
and receive that blessing...

01:01:00.128 --> 01:01:02.997
"which thy well-beloved Son
shall then pronounce...

01:01:03.097 --> 01:01:05.099
"to all that love and fear thee...

01:01:05.199 --> 01:01:09.602
"through Jesus Christ
our mediator and redeemer. Amen.

01:01:11.072 --> 01:01:15.475
"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God...

01:01:15.743 --> 01:01:20.646
"and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,
be with us all evermore.

01:01:21.649 --> 01:01:22.843
"Amen."

01:01:34.796 --> 01:01:37.526
- I'll see Mrs. Hargood home.
- All right.

01:01:59.187 --> 01:02:01.522
Why are you here?
Why are you dressed like that?

01:02:01.622 --> 01:02:02.824
I can't tell you now.

01:02:02.924 --> 01:02:05.693
Come to my house tonight.
I'll tell you everything then.

01:02:05.793 --> 01:02:07.920
- In the garden.
- Why the garden?

01:02:11.265 --> 01:02:14.462
I can't explain now, my dear,
but do come, please.

01:02:14.736 --> 01:02:17.637
- Yes, all right.
- And not a word to anybody, not to a soul.

01:02:17.739 --> 01:02:18.933
Promise?

01:02:21.042 --> 01:02:23.909
- All right, I promise.
- Thank you, Lucy.

01:02:34.889 --> 01:02:36.823
- Sorry, Jeremy.
- Come on.

01:02:36.991 --> 01:02:39.653
- Hope they haven't left us behind.
- We can always walk.

01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:45.400
I'm afraid the mistress isn't well enough
to see anyone at the moment, sir.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.527
- What name shall I say called?
- My name's Secker. Here's my card.

01:02:49.904 --> 01:02:53.863
- I'll call again. Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Secker.

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:57.544
Betty, I'm just going.

01:02:57.779 --> 01:03:00.839
If anything should happen, you know...

01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:05.113
- let me know at once, will you?
- Very good, sir.

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:12.887
- I'm Paul Paxton, sir.
- Yes, I know.

01:03:13.828 --> 01:03:17.730
- It's a terrible business.
- Yes. Did you know Mr. Hargood well?

01:03:18.399 --> 01:03:19.764
We had met.

01:03:20.468 --> 01:03:22.603
Did you know
that his daughter had disappeared?

01:03:22.703 --> 01:03:24.939
- I had heard. Is there any news?
- Nothing.

01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:27.803
- The police?
- They're worse than useless.

01:03:28.376 --> 01:03:32.246
I go to the station at least four times
every day to ask if they've any news.

01:03:32.346 --> 01:03:34.482
They've told me
not to bother them anymore.

01:03:34.582 --> 01:03:38.143
As far as you know, they are not
carrying out any proper investigation?

01:03:38.252 --> 01:03:41.551
As far as I know,
they are doing absolutely nothing.

01:03:43.391 --> 01:03:45.621
Someone's got to do something.

01:03:48.663 --> 01:03:50.187
I love Alice...

01:03:50.998 --> 01:03:55.935
and to know that she's somewhere in need
of help, and nobody doing anything to...

01:03:56.838 --> 01:03:59.807
Be careful, Paul. Don't do anything...

01:04:01.075 --> 01:04:02.777
that you may be sorry for.

01:04:02.877 --> 01:04:06.108
I couldn't be any sorrier than I am now,
Mr. Secker.

01:04:07.114 --> 01:04:08.445
Good night, sir.

01:04:48.189 --> 01:04:49.986
I'm over here, Lucy.

01:04:51.893 --> 01:04:53.588
- Where?
- Over here.

01:04:57.531 --> 01:04:59.133
You must be frozen.

01:04:59.233 --> 01:05:01.235
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Secret.

01:05:01.335 --> 01:05:04.133
- But I don't understand.
- You will. Follow me.

01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:06.604
- But why?
- Come along.

01:05:20.154 --> 01:05:22.622
- Alice, what is all this?
- Come on.

01:05:28.796 --> 01:05:30.696
Whose carriage is this?

01:05:31.799 --> 01:05:34.324
Alice, you haven't eloped, have you?

01:05:40.441 --> 01:05:41.499
No!

01:05:43.878 --> 01:05:45.971
Please!

01:05:52.286 --> 01:05:53.548
Stop it!

01:06:00.995 --> 01:06:03.054
Alice, tell him to stop!

01:06:10.404 --> 01:06:13.066
Really, what do you think that...

01:06:16.577 --> 01:06:18.913
Come on, Lucy.

01:06:19.013 --> 01:06:21.072
Where are we going, Alice?

01:06:36.464 --> 01:06:38.364
- Come on.
- Where are we?

01:06:39.066 --> 01:06:42.524
- Come on, Lucy.
- Where are we going?

01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:18.836
- Alice, why are we here?
- I want you to meet someone.

01:07:20.007 --> 01:07:22.498
Is it your lover? Where is he?

01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:56.570
Alice, I'm afraid.

01:08:02.616 --> 01:08:05.346
- You're hurting me.
- Do as he tells you.

01:09:04.645 --> 01:09:07.738
I know I shouldn't have come here,
but I had to.

01:09:08.182 --> 01:09:10.479
- You see, I know.
- Know what?

01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:15.444
First Hargood, then his girl...

01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:18.982
then Lucy. Gone!

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.528
It's him. It's Courtley.

01:09:23.063 --> 01:09:26.122
- Pull yourself together.
- Don't you see? It must be.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.865
He's come back to punish us
for what we did to him.

01:09:31.272 --> 01:09:33.263
- Don't you see?
- Drink it.

01:09:36.477 --> 01:09:39.310
- What are we going to do?
- Make sure.

01:09:39.647 --> 01:09:42.550
- What?
- I can't believe it, but we'll make sure.

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:43.707
How?

01:09:43.817 --> 01:09:47.252
By finding out
if the body of Courtley is still there.

01:09:47.854 --> 01:09:48.856
I can't.

01:09:48.956 --> 01:09:51.890
You can and will. Now!

01:10:45.446 --> 01:10:48.643
- Well, it would seem that you were right.
- My God.

01:10:51.919 --> 01:10:54.979
Unless, of course,
someone has hidden the body.

01:10:55.789 --> 01:10:57.120
Hidden it?

01:10:58.192 --> 01:11:00.786
But who? What for?

01:11:01.662 --> 01:11:04.062
I only offer it as a possibility.

01:11:04.565 --> 01:11:06.760
I think, however, we should make sure.

01:11:31.425 --> 01:11:33.359
This has been disturbed.

01:11:34.295 --> 01:11:35.557
Help me.

01:11:46.874 --> 01:11:48.136
Come on.

01:11:55.716 --> 01:11:56.910
My God.

01:11:57.885 --> 01:12:00.945
It's Lucy. She's dead.

01:12:01.221 --> 01:12:03.712
No, she's not dead.

01:12:04.692 --> 01:12:06.057
What do you mean?

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.890
She's neither dead nor alive.

01:12:11.632 --> 01:12:13.896
Look at the marks on her neck.

01:12:14.268 --> 01:12:17.567
Marks? I don't understand.

01:12:25.946 --> 01:12:28.983
Paxton, listen to me!
The marks on her neck...

01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:30.675
She's a vampire!

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.149
I don't understand.

01:12:35.856 --> 01:12:37.255
Oh, my God.

01:12:38.559 --> 01:12:42.518
- What can we do?
- I believe there is a way to release her.

01:12:43.897 --> 01:12:45.296
Release her?

01:12:46.567 --> 01:12:50.025
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.243
Drive a wooden stake through her heart.

01:12:56.343 --> 01:12:58.811
Only then will she be free to die.

01:12:59.079 --> 01:13:00.410
If not...

01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:04.548
she will live out
her nightmare existence forever...

01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:10.012
wandering about in the night,
living off the blood of animals...

01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:14.622
and of human beings like herself.

01:13:15.863 --> 01:13:16.921
No.

01:13:21.101 --> 01:13:23.626
The decision is yours, as her father.

01:13:24.505 --> 01:13:26.336
I can't!

01:13:28.842 --> 01:13:32.642
I will do it, then.
You go away from here until I call you.

01:13:33.247 --> 01:13:36.808
- And when you return, she'll be at peace.
- No, I'll stay.

01:13:54.968 --> 01:13:56.492
Get out of here!

01:13:57.237 --> 01:13:59.705
Get out of here.
Leave us alone, do you hear?

01:14:03.977 --> 01:14:06.146
I'll shoot you again if you don't get out.

01:14:06.246 --> 01:14:08.339
- Paxton...
- Get out!

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.132
Now.

01:15:55.656 --> 01:15:57.385
Help me!

01:16:15.509 --> 01:16:17.443
The second.

01:18:34.748 --> 01:18:36.545
Mrs. Hargood, ma'am.

01:18:39.186 --> 01:18:41.814
- Yes, Betty?
- Mr. Paul is here, ma'am.

01:18:45.559 --> 01:18:48.255
- Ask him to come in, Betty.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:18:59.606 --> 01:19:01.369
Will you go in, sir?

01:19:16.022 --> 01:19:18.354
- Mrs. Hargood?
- Nothing?

01:19:21.094 --> 01:19:23.790
We've searched everywhere, Jeremy and I.

01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:27.392
Every field for miles around, every ditch.

01:19:28.602 --> 01:19:31.400
Is that where you expect
to find her, Paul?

01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:33.336
You think she's dead.

01:19:37.911 --> 01:19:40.345
Why has this happened to us, Paul?

01:19:41.448 --> 01:19:44.645
- What have we ever done?
- God knows, Mrs. Hargood.

01:19:47.954 --> 01:19:49.444
Does he, Paul?

01:20:06.373 --> 01:20:07.567
Father?

01:20:12.913 --> 01:20:14.312
Lucy, what...

01:20:20.821 --> 01:20:23.449
- Where have you been?
- Kiss me, Jeremy.

01:20:24.124 --> 01:20:27.389
- Lucy, my love.
- Kiss me, my darling.

01:20:29.429 --> 01:20:30.657
Oh, God!

01:20:55.722 --> 01:20:59.249
Jeremy, thank God it's you.
For a moment, I thought it was...

01:20:59.492 --> 01:21:02.129
There's something
that you must do for me immediately.

01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:06.632
This letter's got to go to young Paxton,
to Paul, you know. I want you to...

01:21:12.005 --> 01:21:13.233
Not you.

01:21:47.107 --> 01:21:48.506
The third.

01:21:50.944 --> 01:21:52.878
Master...

01:21:54.014 --> 01:21:55.504
did I do well?

01:21:55.815 --> 01:21:57.442
Did I please you?

01:21:58.118 --> 01:21:59.210
Wait.

01:22:02.622 --> 01:22:03.816
Please.

01:22:04.858 --> 01:22:07.019
Please wait. Please.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:51.063
As it was addressed to you, sir,
I thought you might like to have it.

01:22:51.171 --> 01:22:54.608
I opened it because I thought
it might throw some light on all this.

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:58.474
- And did it?
- Ramblings of a lunatic, sir. You'll see.

01:22:58.845 --> 01:23:02.110
He goes on here
about vampires and suchlike.

01:23:03.049 --> 01:23:05.677
You couldn't have a clearer case, sir.

01:23:06.353 --> 01:23:08.021
Son hates his father...

01:23:08.121 --> 01:23:11.921
he's hot-blooded, they quarrel,
and the son loses his temper.

01:23:12.425 --> 01:23:14.518
Quite straightforward, sir.

01:23:15.028 --> 01:23:19.658
However, we've got him locked up
safe and sound.

01:23:21.034 --> 01:23:24.170
But Jeremy did not hate his father.
He was one of the most even...

01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:29.105
- If you've come here to obstruct justice...
- I came here because you sent for me.

01:23:29.743 --> 01:23:33.406
Here's your letter, sir.
I shan't need to see you anymore.

01:23:34.748 --> 01:23:37.979
- And don't go touching that, will you, sir?
- No.

01:24:01.808 --> 01:24:03.002
Master.

01:24:28.568 --> 01:24:31.438
You have the courage to do
what has to be done...

01:24:31.538 --> 01:24:33.665
and above all...

01:24:34.607 --> 01:24:38.668
your love for Alice will act as
your strength and your protection.

01:24:39.746 --> 01:24:41.714
And you must believe me.

01:24:42.148 --> 01:24:45.015
You must arm yourself
with knowledge, Paul.

01:24:45.718 --> 01:24:49.689
And so you will see that, while there is
little hope for your dear sister...

01:24:49.789 --> 01:24:51.689
Alice may have escaped.

01:24:52.058 --> 01:24:55.084
Find her, Paul,
and find her before nightfall.

01:24:55.929 --> 01:24:58.762
Only then will you know the truth.

01:24:59.966 --> 01:25:02.799
We know that she is under his influence...

01:25:03.169 --> 01:25:07.037
but she may not yet
be his sister in blood.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.868
Not yet.

01:25:09.375 --> 01:25:12.708
So find her, Paul. Find her!

01:25:14.147 --> 01:25:16.411
Find her before it is too late.

01:30:26.225 --> 01:30:27.226
Take it away.

01:30:27.326 --> 01:30:29.395
You must give it to me,
or we will punish you.

01:30:29.495 --> 01:30:32.799
You're free, Alice.
Free to choose good or evil.

01:30:32.899 --> 01:30:35.835
You're not one of them yet.
You're free to choose.

01:30:35.935 --> 01:30:39.871
- I must do as he says. He's my master.
- He's not!

01:30:49.215 --> 01:30:52.673
Did I do well, master?
Take me with you, master.

01:30:52.885 --> 01:30:55.080
I have no further use for you.

01:31:27.954 --> 01:31:31.324
Run, Alice!
Run as fast as you can away from here.

01:31:31.424 --> 01:31:35.121
Not without you, Paul.
Please, you must come, too. He'll kill us!

01:31:36.395 --> 01:31:37.997
- Please.
- I can't go.

01:31:38.097 --> 01:31:39.792
Please, Paul.

01:31:43.169 --> 01:31:46.229
Please run. Do as I say!
