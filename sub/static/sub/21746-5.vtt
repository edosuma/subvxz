WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:10.291
Nick, copy, please,
I'm approaching the location.

00:10.583 --> 00:12.000
Right behind you, D.

00:13.375 --> 00:14.375
Where's the Chief?

00:15.375 --> 00:16.875
He's responding. He's en route.

00:17.041 --> 00:18.541
I'll lead us in.

00:18.625 --> 00:19.708
Copy that.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074

00:31.291 --> 00:32.958
Well, here she is.

00:38.166 --> 00:39.375
Do you see anything?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.500
Looks clear from here.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.291
Which car is he in?

01:00.375 --> 01:01.541
TrailBlazer.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.416
He drives a Prius.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.458
TrailBlazer.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.208
Fuck.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.750
What the fuck are you doing?

02:01.833 --> 02:03.291
Well, he's not here.

02:03.375 --> 02:04.625
Yet.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.000
Payload's gone.
Looks like computers.

02:31.916 --> 02:33.500
The driver's out cold.

02:33.875 --> 02:35.666
Steady pulse,
but he doesn't look good.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.000
What if he's not coming?

02:40.500 --> 02:42.000
He'll come if it's man down.

02:44.375 --> 02:45.500
It's gonna be a lot quicker

02:45.583 --> 02:47.416
if we transport him
out of here ourselves.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.083
At least get him somewhere
they can send a chopper.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.601
One of us has to stay here
to hold the scene.

02:51.625 --> 02:52.458
Yeah, right?

02:52.541 --> 02:53.875
So where the fuck
is the Chief at?

02:53.958 --> 02:55.083
He's responding.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.041
Fuck's sakes, Denise,

02:56.125 --> 02:57.525
would you stop
covering for the guy?

02:57.583 --> 02:58.916
He's progress impaired.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.500
Yeah, no, he's impaired,

03:00.583 --> 03:02.666
I'll give you that,
by a bottle of whiskey or three.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.875
He'll be here. I...

03:17.541 --> 03:18.958
Chief, come in.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.750
Goddamn it,
I know you can hear me.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.125
There was an incident
at the callout

03:29.583 --> 03:31.083
involving Denise.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.125
So where the fuck are you?

03:52.541 --> 03:54.500
Daddy's gonna buy you
a looking glass.

04:31.583 --> 04:32.916
Have you used
one of these before?

04:35.083 --> 04:36.750
I grew up in the country...

04:40.041 --> 04:43.375
with a mom
who hated the British.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.208
She never liked your dad.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.583
You and I...

04:55.750 --> 04:58.000
we're gonna look after
ourselves from now on.

05:11.791 --> 05:14.041
That woman was an easy target
and you shoved me.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.416
Hey. Hey! Hey!

05:15.500 --> 05:16.625
I saved our asses!

05:17.291 --> 05:19.411
You kill a cop around here,
it's the same as anywhere.

05:19.458 --> 05:20.666
They go fucking mental.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.059
We came here
to kill a cop, Frank.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.625
- Shh. Hey.
- When have you ever once

05:23.708 --> 05:25.083
finished your fucking job right?

05:25.708 --> 05:27.500
Pissing and whining
about your fucked luck.

05:27.625 --> 05:30.000
It's you, you're the reason
you're a fucking loser.

05:32.791 --> 05:36.041
Take care of this lot.
Try not to fuck that up?

06:25.083 --> 06:26.250
Hey.

06:28.041 --> 06:29.041
Hey!

06:30.791 --> 06:32.000
Get back behind that line.

06:35.750 --> 06:36.750
Did you hear me?

06:42.916 --> 06:43.916
Step.

06:46.083 --> 06:48.208
Any, description
of the perpetrator?

06:48.291 --> 06:49.371
What is your business here?

06:51.458 --> 06:53.208
I see motorcycle track,

06:53.666 --> 06:56.458
so I was wondering
if biker had a hand in this.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.916
When we make the arrests,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.833
I'm sure your company
will be informed.

06:59.958 --> 07:01.125
Absolutely.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.875
If you wouldn't mind, do you
have a manifest for the payload?

07:05.583 --> 07:07.833
It was probably
in the driver's cab.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.083
It would be a big help

07:11.166 --> 07:14.083
to know what was stolen.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Asshole.

07:41.333 --> 07:44.208
I was sorry to hear
about your colleague.

08:37.916 --> 08:38.916
Idiot!

09:05.916 --> 09:07.500
I've never barred
a police chief before,

09:07.583 --> 09:09.541
but after last night,
maybe I should.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.083
You know, bikers might
be trouble,

09:11.166 --> 09:12.708
at least they're trouble
I can handle.

09:12.791 --> 09:13.833
Put something in it.

09:13.916 --> 09:15.500
Go home, Chief. Sleep it off.

09:15.583 --> 09:16.916
What if I don't?

09:17.291 --> 09:18.583
You're gonna call the cops?

09:18.666 --> 09:19.791
Oi.

09:20.375 --> 09:21.375
Whiskey.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.833
What, are you a cowboy now?

09:26.750 --> 09:28.166
You gotta tell me which one.

09:28.333 --> 09:29.500
You choose.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.500
Leave the bottle.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.000
So, this is your
new station house?

09:53.500 --> 09:54.875
You know she led the response?

09:55.958 --> 09:58.166
Covering for your sorry ass
all the way.

09:59.791 --> 10:00.625
She all right?

10:00.708 --> 10:01.791
She was fuckin' shot.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.083
Where?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.041
Highway 40.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.375
No, you fuckin' idiot. Where?

10:13.625 --> 10:14.916
In the shoulder.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.541
Is it through and through?

10:17.625 --> 10:18.500
What?

10:18.583 --> 10:19.750
Did it nick the artery?

10:21.791 --> 10:23.000
Any bone damage?

10:26.416 --> 10:27.458
She gonna live?

10:27.541 --> 10:28.541
Yeah, she's gonna...

10:29.500 --> 10:30.791
Hey, fuck you!

10:31.125 --> 10:32.666
You left us on our own
out there.

10:32.750 --> 10:33.833
Go home, Nick.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.958
You are beyond unfit for duty.

10:43.416 --> 10:45.416
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn over your weapon.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.000
Go home,

10:48.375 --> 10:50.083
put your feet up.
You've had a shock.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.375
Chief.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.541
Someone tried to kill me
and they're gonna try again.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.184
And when they do,
I'm gonna burn this shithole

10:59.208 --> 11:00.458
to the fucking ground.

11:27.541 --> 11:30.166
Remember that rainy evening

11:30.250 --> 11:32.541
I threw you out.

11:34.791 --> 11:38.208
With nothing
but a finetooth comb.

11:38.291 --> 11:39.291
Can I help?

11:40.583 --> 11:42.291
Don't normally allow
customers back here.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.125
So, what you clear
in a week here, then?

11:50.166 --> 11:52.583
Two things I never
discuss with strangers.

11:52.666 --> 11:53.958
The first is money.

11:54.041 --> 11:55.583
All right, let me guess.

11:55.666 --> 11:59.916
Take off wages, utilities,
stock, taxes, license, mortgage,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.458
I'd say, what,
two grand a week, tops?

12:06.541 --> 12:07.791
Look at you.

12:08.791 --> 12:10.791
A woman of your grace
and stature shouldn't be

12:10.875 --> 12:12.000
lugging crates around.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.309
You know, you'd make 10 times
what you're making now

12:17.333 --> 12:19.413
with a late license and a bit of
adult entertainment.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.416
What?

12:21.500 --> 12:23.708
What kind of adult entertainment
did you have in mind?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.833
Cold beer, warm women.
Nothing too tasteful.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.708
I ain't looking for a partner.

12:33.333 --> 12:34.750
What about a backer then?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.208
A backer?

12:37.916 --> 12:38.916
Yeah.

12:39.416 --> 12:40.416
You know...

12:41.875 --> 12:43.041
You out front,

12:44.458 --> 12:45.666
me right behind you.

12:46.625 --> 12:48.017
What exactly
do you bring to the table?

12:48.041 --> 12:49.083
Hundred grand.

12:49.666 --> 12:51.375
Once I liquidize my assets.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.625
Strip bar?

12:56.416 --> 12:58.958
One stage, two poles,
six girls on a rota.

12:59.416 --> 13:01.833
$20 on the door
and a premium on all drinks.

13:01.916 --> 13:03.833
You put the "boom"
back in boomtown.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.500
I'm telling you, love,

13:05.541 --> 13:07.166
you'd make a killing
on these oil boys.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.458
All those paychecks,

13:08.541 --> 13:10.125
nowhere else to spend them
but your bar?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.250
What kind of a girl
do you take me for?

13:14.166 --> 13:16.250
I take you for
a very capable woman.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.083
I'm sorry to intrude
while you're grieving.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.500
And yet you're here.

14:05.333 --> 14:08.333
So you've come to talk
about my husband.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.416
I came here to talk to you.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.333
About my husband.

14:11.416 --> 14:12.416
About you.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.083
About my hopes and dreams?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.041
This isn't a sales pitch.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.125
Of course it is.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.375
Look, I came here to make

14:20.458 --> 14:22.500
the best life possible
for my children.

14:23.666 --> 14:25.125
With an alcoholic husband.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.351
- Who I'm not here to talk about.
- You're not here to talk about.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.041
- That life...
- Is over.

14:29.458 --> 14:30.666
I have nothing left to lose.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.083
You have a daughter.

14:32.958 --> 14:34.750
And a home and bills to pay.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.333
I have a son in the ground.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.791
The Municipal Council
is reviewing

14:42.875 --> 14:44.875
your husband's position
as Chief of Police.

14:44.958 --> 14:47.625
Jesus, you're so transparent.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.791
This isn't about him,
it's about you and Anna.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.208
And getting his police pension
and health care benefits.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.250
If North Stream takes that
to the federal courts,

14:57.333 --> 14:58.666
it all goes away.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.291
You will have nothing.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.333
Well, I'll get a job.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.708
It's an official retraction
of the allegations that he made

15:14.791 --> 15:15.791
against North Stream.

15:24.458 --> 15:25.333
Why?

15:25.416 --> 15:27.916
Why does a multibillion-
dollar company care

15:28.333 --> 15:32.500
what a drunken, disgraced
police chief says about it?

15:34.666 --> 15:36.375
What are they so worried about?

15:39.041 --> 15:40.083
I don't know.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
What's she doing here?

15:44.208 --> 15:45.208
She doesn't know.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.625
I came to talk to your mother.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.666
Really? What about?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.666
Sometimes it helps to talk.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.541
All he needs to do is sign.

15:55.625 --> 15:56.916
Sign what?

16:10.041 --> 16:11.458
No, Dad won't sign this.

16:12.916 --> 16:14.583
Well, if he won't sign it,

16:15.166 --> 16:17.125
North Stream will
send in their lawyers.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.958
And they won't be
bringing flowers.

16:21.041 --> 16:22.416
So this is why you're here?

16:23.041 --> 16:24.166
Yes.

16:24.916 --> 16:25.916
Okay.

16:27.250 --> 16:30.083
Well, in that case,
I am glad you came.

16:35.541 --> 16:37.041
I feel much better now.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.083
One.

16:57.791 --> 16:58.875
Two.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.583
Looks like we got
a problem here, Chiefo.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.790
You put our friend
in the hospital last night.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.875
The record is 132.

17:28.208 --> 17:29.916
Just getting warmed up.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.750
Three.

17:33.666 --> 17:35.125
Did you know that...

17:37.666 --> 17:41.250
That a really, really
fast punch trails at

17:42.291 --> 17:45.208
45 feet and 11 inches
per second.

17:46.416 --> 17:49.958
That's... 30 miles an hour.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.625
Four.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.791
But it's not about speed, is it?

17:59.416 --> 18:00.625
About heft.

18:01.958 --> 18:02.958
Five.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.333
It's the timing.

18:08.958 --> 18:10.000
Six.

18:10.541 --> 18:14.000
And, and knowing
when it's your moment.

18:16.666 --> 18:17.875
This is not your moment.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.125
I'm bait.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.208
You're small fry.

18:23.875 --> 18:25.208
Now fuck off.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.000
Seven.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.333
Okay. Find your target.

18:54.791 --> 18:55.791
Yep.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.333
And pull the trigger gently.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.041
You're scared of him,
aren't you?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.083
No.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.333
I'm scared of the trouble
he brings.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.458
I'm not.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.625
Yes.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.541
Won't you come home Bill Bailey?

19:20.916 --> 19:22.875
Won't you come home?

19:22.958 --> 19:25.125
I'll do the cooking, honey

19:25.208 --> 19:26.875
I'll pay the rent.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.208
How did you acquire this?

19:47.833 --> 19:49.125
I want to get dressed.

19:49.208 --> 19:50.750
Please don't waste my time.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.916
Some guy in the bar.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.458
- What guy?
- You know,

19:55.541 --> 19:59.041
big guy, Canadian, check shirt.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.875
What? You're saying he stole it?

20:04.625 --> 20:05.958
Is that why you're here?

20:06.208 --> 20:08.291
North Stream,
they don't trust their employee.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.708
They got tracking,
monitoring software installed

20:12.791 --> 20:14.125
that activate on start up.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.041
You know,
he never said he nicked it.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.208
What a bastard?

20:20.875 --> 20:25.416
Hijacking, kidnap with violence,

20:25.500 --> 20:28.916
theft, attempted murder
of a police officer...

20:31.166 --> 20:32.750
I want those laptop.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.000
Call me when you can
make that happen.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.166
Oi, you can't take
my fucking passport!

21:13.958 --> 21:15.083
Perfect.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.333
I wouldn't ask if I
didn't know it was gonna work.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.416
You've done things for me.

21:26.375 --> 21:27.708
Things only a brother does.

21:28.458 --> 21:29.541
End of the day,

21:30.416 --> 21:31.833
it means everything.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.791
I know why you need this.

21:35.666 --> 21:36.666
It's blood law.

21:38.208 --> 21:40.375
To free your soul from the pain.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.541
I got this, brother.

22:07.083 --> 22:08.250
Look at me.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.541
Look at me.

22:23.791 --> 22:24.791
Look at me, Jim.

22:31.791 --> 22:32.791
Look at me.

22:35.666 --> 22:36.750
There we go.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.458
What the fuck are you?

22:41.583 --> 22:43.125
My name is Elijah.

22:43.500 --> 22:48.291
I am an interventionist from
the Newhope Clinic, Calgary.

22:49.916 --> 22:51.416
Your wife called us.

22:52.083 --> 22:53.625
She's worried about you, Jim.

22:55.666 --> 22:56.666
Is she?

22:59.666 --> 23:01.083
That's nice.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.791
I'm here to take you
to a better place.

23:03.875 --> 23:05.375
Well, that shouldn't be hard.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.333
There are two ways
we can do this.

23:07.958 --> 23:10.916
In the passenger seat
or in the trunk,

23:11.416 --> 23:13.625
but either way,
you're coming with me, Jim.

23:21.958 --> 23:23.916
I'll tell you what, Elaine.

23:28.458 --> 23:29.833
I'll let you drive me home,

23:31.416 --> 23:33.750
and I can talk to my wife,

23:34.541 --> 23:36.166
straighten this out.

23:36.875 --> 23:41.750
And then, I'll let you drive me
back here and buy me a drink.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.666
You never know,
you might get lucky.

23:55.125 --> 23:56.416
Well...

23:57.916 --> 24:00.083
- After you.
- No.

24:00.708 --> 24:02.000
After you.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.375
Your mum brought you up nice.

24:09.958 --> 24:12.166
Mr. Worth, we'll take my car.

24:12.666 --> 24:15.250
Well, I can't drive, can I?
I'm totally fucking pissed.

24:17.458 --> 24:18.708
Mr. Worth!

24:18.791 --> 24:19.916
Just give me a sec!

24:29.708 --> 24:32.333
Elaine, do you wanna touch me?

24:34.958 --> 24:36.500
Here, hold that.

24:40.208 --> 24:41.708
I've done this before.

24:43.541 --> 24:44.750
That's mine.

25:12.166 --> 25:15.250
When did you come
to realize that

25:15.791 --> 25:20.750
a power greater than you
could restore your sanity?

25:21.541 --> 25:25.500
Turn your life over to...

25:26.583 --> 25:28.458
to the care of a power
greater than you.

25:32.916 --> 25:34.250
Play the game.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.791
Give me step four, step four,
step four, step four.

25:37.625 --> 25:38.625
Step four,

25:39.166 --> 25:43.291
a searching and thorough
moral stocktaking.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.666
Play the game.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.791
What's next?

25:48.666 --> 25:50.708
Step five, go on, then.

25:52.416 --> 25:54.166
Step five, Elaine.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.083
Whoa, whoa!

26:12.250 --> 26:13.770
Don't distract Daddy
when he's driving.

26:24.666 --> 26:25.750
Fuck.

26:48.333 --> 26:49.375
That thing chafing?

27:14.875 --> 27:15.875
You all right?

27:18.375 --> 27:19.375
You all right, mate?

27:33.375 --> 27:34.458
I'll be right there.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.666
Hey, mate.

27:59.916 --> 28:02.041
Roger?

28:05.416 --> 28:06.916
That's gonna hurt.

28:07.333 --> 28:08.583
Fuckin' terrible, that is.

28:11.208 --> 28:12.500
Turn over.

28:16.583 --> 28:17.708
Here you are.

28:17.833 --> 28:20.541
Hold on. There we go.

28:21.416 --> 28:23.500
Look. There you are.

28:26.791 --> 28:28.000
Now,

28:28.083 --> 28:30.666
I know that

28:32.625 --> 28:34.291
you're only doing the dog work

28:35.208 --> 28:36.583
and that you don't know much.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.250
But what you do know
you are gonna tell me.

28:41.125 --> 28:42.208
Right?

28:43.458 --> 28:44.458
Say it.

28:58.333 --> 28:59.375
Who sent you?

29:01.208 --> 29:02.375
How many are you?

29:03.958 --> 29:05.291
Who pulled the trigger?

29:05.833 --> 29:07.416
Speak to me, Rodge.

29:09.250 --> 29:10.375
Talk to me.

29:13.416 --> 29:14.500
Remember step five.

29:15.791 --> 29:16.791
Oi.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.125
Admit to another person,

29:20.208 --> 29:22.291
to ourselves
and to a higher power

29:23.208 --> 29:25.166
the true nature of our failings.

29:27.458 --> 29:28.666
Step six.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.000
We are ready and willing

29:33.083 --> 29:35.666
to have God remove
all our weaknesses

29:36.041 --> 29:38.291
of character. I think.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.500
Step seven is boring.

29:42.291 --> 29:43.375
Step eight.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.291
Make a list of all
the people we've harmed

29:48.291 --> 29:51.583
and be ready to make amends
to them all.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.208
Who's trying to kill me?

29:56.166 --> 29:57.541
And why?

30:07.625 --> 30:08.958
Who killed my son?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.416
I see you...

30:45.041 --> 30:46.875
Jack Devlin.

30:49.416 --> 30:51.166
I see all of you.

31:01.416 --> 31:02.791
What did you call me?

31:04.541 --> 31:07.041
Any child of yours
is better off dead.

31:12.166 --> 31:14.958
I did your boy a favor
when I blew his brains out.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.458
Gin and tonic.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.916
Straight to a man's heart.

34:37.791 --> 34:39.208
There's something
you need to know.

34:39.291 --> 34:41.000
Full disclosure.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.666
Right before my ex cut out,

34:45.750 --> 34:48.916
he remortgaged the bar,
took off with the money.

34:49.375 --> 34:51.125
Now, I run a good ship, okay?

34:51.541 --> 34:54.458
But the fucker's left me short
with the bank month to month.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.791
However, I have spreadsheets.

34:57.083 --> 35:01.291
Now, if you factor in the debt
solution and your investment,

35:01.375 --> 35:03.458
well, you, you can
follow the projection.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.250
I have a feeling
for a future here.

35:14.958 --> 35:17.583
- Wonderful workmanship.
- Thank you.

35:27.416 --> 35:28.833
Frank?

35:29.125 --> 35:30.250
Yeah?

35:31.958 --> 35:33.458
Something took over there.

35:36.458 --> 35:38.375
Something bigger
than both of us.

35:41.416 --> 35:42.666
I felt it.

35:46.833 --> 35:47.958
Look.

35:48.125 --> 35:50.583
I don't trifle, I don't lie.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.666
I give my heart, it stays given.

35:54.833 --> 35:56.750
- Yeah.
- But there's this.

35:57.875 --> 36:00.583
My husband, he belonged
to the bike club.

36:01.958 --> 36:03.416
He was beholden.

36:04.541 --> 36:05.875
I'm not doing that again.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.750
So I need to know,
are you beholden, Frank Kane?

36:10.416 --> 36:11.250
To who?

36:11.333 --> 36:12.333
The kid.

36:12.791 --> 36:13.875
Whitey.

36:14.375 --> 36:16.916
There's an unholy alliance
between you two.

36:18.166 --> 36:20.333
Is there something
I need to know, Frank?

36:23.000 --> 36:24.375
It's a family thing.

36:25.541 --> 36:27.083
A debt of honor.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.625
When it's been repaid,
I'm beholden to no one.

36:35.791 --> 36:37.041
Promise.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.416
Hush,
little baby, don't say a word.

36:55.541 --> 36:57.833
Daddy's gonna buy you
a mockingbird.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.333
And if that mockingbird
don't sing.

37:09.375 --> 37:11.500
Daddy's gonna buy you
a diamond ring.

37:17.125 --> 37:19.250
And if that diamond ring
is brass.

37:26.250 --> 37:28.583
Daddy's gonna get you
a looking glass.

37:34.291 --> 37:35.416
You asleep, love?

37:36.250 --> 37:37.291
You missed a verse.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.541
Where are you?

37:43.125 --> 37:44.208
In the woods.

37:46.583 --> 37:47.958
I'm lost in the woods.

37:49.791 --> 37:51.416
But I'm getting there, darling.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.083
Dad.

37:59.958 --> 38:01.375
When are you coming home?

38:05.875 --> 38:07.000
Soon, love.

38:08.750 --> 38:09.833
Soon.

38:18.416 --> 38:19.416
Shit!

38:23.625 --> 38:24.708
Dad, are you hurt?

38:26.541 --> 38:27.625
I'm all right.

38:36.833 --> 38:38.041
Nice shooting, Irish.

38:40.625 --> 38:41.791
Jack.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.125
It's not your blood.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.333
Whose is it?

40:35.291 --> 40:37.125
Good shot, good shot.

40:48.708 --> 40:50.083
Christ Almighty.

40:50.541 --> 40:52.416
He saved my life.

40:54.708 --> 40:55.958
Godswill?

40:57.708 --> 40:58.750
He's dead.

41:04.291 --> 41:05.458
I'm...

41:06.000 --> 41:07.583
I'm so sorry, mate.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.500
I know how much he meant to you.

41:17.125 --> 41:18.916
You won't leave me,
will you, Frank?

41:21.416 --> 41:23.666
No, I'm not going anywhere.

41:23.958 --> 41:25.750
'Cause I don't think
I can do this on my own.

41:26.375 --> 41:27.416
Do what, Whitey?

41:28.291 --> 41:29.458
Jack dies.

41:31.458 --> 41:32.583
But first,

41:33.208 --> 41:35.125
his family for my friend.
