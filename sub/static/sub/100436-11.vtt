WEBVTT

00:04.134 --> 00:05.918
- I don't miss Porzingis.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.050
I'm glad the Knicks
got rid of him.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.573
- That's crazy.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.140
You never trade a seven-footer
with three-point range.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.405
Why is the precinct
full of bunnies?

00:16.320 --> 00:18.279
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

00:18.322 --> 00:20.716
- Oh!

00:20.759 --> 00:23.066
- This is still going on?
- What is?

00:24.415 --> 00:28.202
- Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Halloween heist!

00:28.245 --> 00:29.768
all:

00:51.529 --> 00:53.183
- Happy Halloween.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.663
I see you all
have your game faces on.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.578
Special shout-out to Amy
who is clearly only wearing

00:56.621 --> 00:59.146
that pumpkin costume
to conceal her heist equipment.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.451
- Nuh-uh.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.409
I was greeting kids
at the Halloween party.

01:01.452 --> 01:02.540
- Nobody believes you.

01:02.584 --> 01:03.672
- Anyhow, will there
be a new champion

01:03.715 --> 01:05.761
crowned this year,
or will I become

01:05.804 --> 01:07.067
the first ever
three-time winner,

01:07.110 --> 01:08.720
building on
my glorious victories

01:08.764 --> 01:10.200
in heists one and five?

01:10.244 --> 01:11.201
- You didn't win
the fifth heist.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.376
I did when you proposed to me.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.856
- I won that year.

01:13.899 --> 01:16.598
You ended up with a modified
version of the cummerbund,

01:16.641 --> 01:18.730
and you only got that because
you slept your way into it.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.428
- Sorry, sir, that no one here
wants to bone you,

01:20.471 --> 01:21.820
you dusty, old skeleton.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.518
- Whoa!

01:23.561 --> 01:27.130
- Okay, so this segs me nicely
into my next point--decorum.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.392
This is supposed
to be a fun day

01:28.436 --> 01:29.698
that brings us all
closer together,

01:29.741 --> 01:31.395
but in the past few years,
I've noticed it

01:31.439 --> 01:33.180
trending
in the opposite direction.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.224
- Is this about
the surveillance system

01:34.268 --> 01:35.225
I set up in your apartment?

01:35.269 --> 01:37.401
Sleep, sleep, you ugly morons.

01:37.445 --> 01:38.924
- No, but it is now.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.144
All right, look, the point is,
this year when we team up,

01:41.188 --> 01:43.581
there will be no betrayals
because at the end of the day,

01:43.625 --> 01:45.583
we're all friends,
and we love each other,

01:45.627 --> 01:48.151
and also you'll be handcuffed
to your partner.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.153
If you undo them, you lose.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.590
Now, in each of these envelopes
is a name.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.462
The last four champs
will pick their partners,

01:54.505 --> 01:56.899
and, since I'm already up here,
I'll just go first so--

01:56.942 --> 01:58.422
- Nope.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.771
You've obviously rigged this
to get the best teammate,

01:59.815 --> 02:00.903
but I'm not falling
for that crap this time.

02:00.946 --> 02:04.167
So I am going to partner with

02:04.211 --> 02:05.734
Scully.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.518
You know what?
We are friends, best friends.

02:07.562 --> 02:08.519
Sorry I took your envelope.

02:08.563 --> 02:09.564
- No, no, no!
It's too late.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.174
Boyle, cuff 'em.
- It's okay, Rosa.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.393
I'm focused this year,

02:12.436 --> 02:14.395
and I'm more determined to win
than ever.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.266
I also really have to go
to the bathroom.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.572
- Why didn't you say that before

02:17.615 --> 02:18.660
he put the handcuffs on us?

02:18.703 --> 02:20.662
- Okay, I'll go next.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.621
I have...

02:23.665 --> 02:24.840
Geppetto?
- Yeah.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.233
- Ugh, that must be Charles.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.669
- It is because
I'm the puppeteer,

02:27.712 --> 02:28.800
and you're all
my little puppets.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.280
- Ugh.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.760
Can we choke our partner
to death with our handcuffs?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.153
- Sure, choke away.
Terry?

02:33.196 --> 02:34.154
- I'm out.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.807
Terry is retiring
from heisting.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.940
I don't have anything left to
prove after my win last year.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.202
- But we need you.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.508
What if one of us has a plan

02:40.551 --> 02:41.683
that involves
a big, strong brute?

02:41.726 --> 02:43.163
- Not a great sales pitch, Jake.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.948
Terry is going out on top.
- Ugh, fine.

02:45.991 --> 02:49.778
I guess that makes it my turn,
so I will pick my partner.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.519
And it is...

02:51.562 --> 02:53.434
Raymond Holt.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.305
Well, well, well,
it appears

02:55.349 --> 02:57.525
the original two heist champs
are teaming up.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.656
Should we just skip ahead

02:58.700 --> 02:59.831
so everyone
can bow down to us now?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.572
- Yes, you all heard him.
Bow down.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.052
Boyle, you first.

03:03.095 --> 03:04.836
- He is not gonna bow do--ugh,
he's already doing it.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.838
- Well, they're gonna win.
I'm currying favor.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.319
- So what prize
are we playing for, you ask?

03:09.363 --> 03:11.191
- Wait, what about me?
Nobody picked my envelope.

03:13.889 --> 03:16.457
- So what prize
are we playing for, you ask?

03:17.806 --> 03:19.851
- Ooh, the infinity gauntlet
from "The Avengers."

03:19.895 --> 03:21.723
- Yes, except not quite.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.334
The actual movie replica
was extremely expensive,

03:24.378 --> 03:25.814
so I had to get something
off Russian eBay.

03:25.857 --> 03:29.209
Say hello to
the Infinitude Gobbler.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.602
It's identical to the one
that Thaboo wore

03:31.646 --> 03:32.690
in the movie "Avangaboys."

03:32.734 --> 03:33.952
- This glove...
- Gobbler.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.607
- Contains
three plastic jewels...

03:36.651 --> 03:38.348
- The Infinitude Gems.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.350
- Each representing one aspect
of a heist winner.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.439
"Amazing," "human," "genius."

03:42.483 --> 03:44.528
Whoever possesses
these stones at midnight

03:44.572 --> 03:45.877
will be named champion.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.705
- But what obstacles
will I face,

03:47.749 --> 03:48.880
you may ask yourself.

03:48.924 --> 03:51.013
Well, the Infinitude Gems
will be guarded

03:51.056 --> 03:54.625
by a ferocious
and daunting sentry.

03:54.669 --> 03:55.844
- Hey, best friends.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.280
- We're not
your best friends, Bill.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.326
You don't get to decide that.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.328
- So Bill will hide the gems
in his pockets.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.981
- You're really gonna
have to root around in there.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.940
I dried my jeans,
so they're extra tight.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.550
- You were right, Amy.
I should have got a safe.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.900
Sorry, everyone.
Let the heist begin!

04:11.555 --> 04:12.904
- I can't believe
the two strongest competitors

04:12.948 --> 04:14.384
got partnered up.

04:14.428 --> 04:18.910
We're a dream team like
in the 1992 Summer Olympics.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.782
- Okay, I know you're
not talking about basketball,

04:20.825 --> 04:22.000
so just tell me
what weird sport

04:22.044 --> 04:23.001
you think
the Dream Team was from.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.176
- Sport?

04:24.220 --> 04:25.308
I'm talking about
the opening ceremonies.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.528
- Agnes Baltsa
and Alfredo Kraus

04:27.571 --> 04:29.878
singing back-to-back arias.

04:29.921 --> 04:32.576
- Wonderful, yes, we are just
like Agnes and Alfredo

04:32.620 --> 04:33.925
all thanks to me.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.318
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.493
I rigged the envelopes
so that we could team up.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.408
- But you chose
Scully initially.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.454
- Only because I knew
as soon as I tried to go first,

04:40.497 --> 04:41.977
Rosa would jump in,
and then I made sure

04:42.020 --> 04:43.761
no one picked our envelopes
by marking them

04:43.805 --> 04:44.936
with Cheeto thumbprints.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.938
- Oh, so everyone would assume

04:46.982 --> 04:48.418
that they were
Hitchcock and Scully's.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.811
Brilliant.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.421
These fools don't stand
a chance against us.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.336
- Yeah, they really are fools,
aren't they?

04:53.380 --> 04:55.338
Just like whoever
Agnes and Alfredo

04:55.382 --> 04:56.992
beat at singing to get
into the Olympics.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.689
I know nothing about opera.
- No, you're right.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.431
- Amy's a real
Teresa Berganza, huh?

05:03.346 --> 05:05.348
I don't know.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.784
- Look at them laughing.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.438
Jake must have said
something really funny.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.005
Should we forfeit
and go hear what it was?

05:10.048 --> 05:11.702
- No, Charles,
we're not forfeiting.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.443
I wanted Jake
to rig the envelopes

05:13.487 --> 05:14.792
and partner up with Holt.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.360
I gave him the idea
by making him watch "Lincoln."

05:17.404 --> 05:19.797
- Oh, wow, a team of rivals.

05:19.841 --> 05:20.972
- Mm-hmm.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.365
- And when that didn't work,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.324
we watched
"X-Men: Days of Future Past."

05:24.367 --> 05:26.891
- Magneto and Professor X
working together?

05:26.935 --> 05:28.458
Amy, are you seeing this?

05:28.502 --> 05:30.068
- Yes, I see it.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.635
I see it all.

05:31.679 --> 05:32.897
- Why would you do that?

05:32.941 --> 05:34.725
Jake and Holt are like
the '92 dream team.

05:34.769 --> 05:35.944
- I know you're not talking
about sports,

05:35.987 --> 05:37.424
so who do you think
the '92 Dream Team was?

05:37.467 --> 05:39.426
- Aladdin and Abu.
- Right.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.819
- Look, Jake and Holt
are too stubborn

05:41.863 --> 05:43.604
and too proud to work as a team.

05:43.647 --> 05:46.607
Once they implode, we'll waltz
in and grab the gems.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.826
- I do love waltzing.
What about Rosa and Scully?

05:48.870 --> 05:50.350
- I'm not too worried
about them.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.655
- Hey, Rosa,
you brought headphones right?

05:51.699 --> 05:53.918
To drown out the sound?
- No.

05:53.962 --> 05:57.357
- Oh boy, I'm really sorry
for what's heading your way.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.142
- I'm sorry!

06:00.185 --> 06:01.622
- So here's the plan.
- Okay.

06:03.798 --> 06:06.670
- We're gonna need pliers,
grappling hook--

06:06.714 --> 06:08.063
- Wait.
Amy, look.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.501
The bullpen's
filling up with smoke.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.503
- Oh, someone's making a move.
- That's right.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.852
And that someone is us.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.158
- Seems like
a pretty sloppy plan.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.464
- You're just saying
it's sloppy because

06:17.507 --> 06:18.726
you're jealous
you didn't think of it.

06:18.769 --> 06:19.814
You don't even know
what we're doing yet.

06:19.857 --> 06:20.728
- Fog up the room
until no one can see

06:20.771 --> 06:22.512
and then steal the gems.

06:22.556 --> 06:23.861
- Yeah, but I also got us
little booties,

06:23.905 --> 06:25.341
so we can move
through the room quietly.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.083
And I memorized the exact
layout of the entire bullpen

06:28.126 --> 06:31.695
using a blindfold
so follow me.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.915
One, two, three, desk.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.526
One, two, turn.

06:36.570 --> 06:39.486
One, two, three, four, Bill.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.704
- Hi, boys.
- Oh, God!

06:40.748 --> 06:42.532
Why do you sound horny?
Very upsetting.

06:42.576 --> 06:43.838
Okay, reaching
into your pockets,

06:43.881 --> 06:45.796
feeling a lot of things,
and I got the gems.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.450
Let's go.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.496
One, two, three--oh!

06:49.539 --> 06:51.149
- Whoa.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.716
Was that the gems?
Did you drop them?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.065
- That chair wasn't
supposed to be there.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.503
Where'd they go?
- I can't see anything.

06:56.546 --> 06:57.721
Turn off the smoke.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.070
It's lucky I was prepared
for you to fail.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.725
Now, I didn't wanna reveal him
this early, but...

07:17.698 --> 07:18.829
Here he comes.

07:18.873 --> 07:21.484
Cheddar, Cheddar the Dog.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.790
- Yeah,
we all knew he was coming.

07:22.833 --> 07:23.834
You don't have to make
such a meal out of it.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.140
Go, Cheddar.
Arcessere.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.534
Means fetch.
Cheddar's been taking Latin.

07:27.577 --> 07:28.839
- Who has the gems?
What's going on?

07:28.883 --> 07:30.667
- And explain it quickly.
I have to pee again.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.626
- You're too late.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.715
For the last three months,
I have been training Cheddar

07:34.758 --> 07:36.586
to retrieve gems.

07:36.630 --> 07:40.068
Using his low center of gravity
and keen sense of smell,

07:40.111 --> 07:41.504
he expertly--

07:41.548 --> 07:43.593
Oh, no.
He swallowed them.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.769
He swallowed the gems!

07:45.813 --> 07:47.510
- Well, .

07:50.513 --> 07:53.429
- Mmm, got a pedicure,
made a smoothie

07:53.473 --> 07:55.126
'cause Terry loves smoothies.

07:55.170 --> 07:58.260
Retiring early was the best
decision I have ever made.

07:58.303 --> 07:59.304
- Well, you're missing out.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.610
People are saying this is

08:00.654 --> 08:02.090
the most fun heist
we've ever done.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.179
- Looks like Holt keeps trying
to put his whole hand

08:04.222 --> 08:06.529
in Cheddar's mouth
while Rosa googles,

08:06.573 --> 08:08.139
"how to make a dog vomit."

08:08.183 --> 08:09.445
- Yeah.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.577
Like I said,
we're having a blast.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.449
- Why would he have
swallowed the gems?

08:13.493 --> 08:16.365
- Well, a photograph of Cheddar
was featured on "Chonky Pups,"

08:16.408 --> 08:18.541
an Instagram account
for overweight pets.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.109
A top comment called him
a "thick king."

08:21.152 --> 08:23.415
Kevin and I put him on a diet,
and I suppose

08:23.459 --> 08:26.462
he got hungry enough
to mistake the gems for food.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.159
- This is why
you don't team up with a dog.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.291
- It's better than
teaming up with Bill

08:29.334 --> 08:30.335
like you do every year.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.511
- Bill is a human.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.469
He is able to use more
than just his mouth.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.558
- Not if you don't want me to.
- Bill, stop chiming in.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.559
- I'm just saying.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.560
I'm not that different
from a dog.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.909
- You're not helping.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.694
- We need to get Cheddar
to a doctor right now.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.478
- Bravo.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.047
What a performance.

08:46.090 --> 08:48.179
Cheddar didn't swallow any gems.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.660
This is all a ruse
just like my brilliant lie

08:50.704 --> 08:52.532
about the pumpkin costume.
- That was good.

08:52.575 --> 08:56.274
- There is no chance in hell
that any of this is real.

08:56.318 --> 08:58.363
- Yep, you can see the gems
right here on the X-ray.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.582
- Okay, so it's real.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.323
- Uh, I'm sorry.
Who are all these people?

09:01.366 --> 09:04.108
- We're coworkers involved
in an elaborate Halloween heist.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.719
Do you seriously
not talk to your vet about us?

09:05.762 --> 09:07.590
- Seems to me
Cheddar has the gems,

09:07.634 --> 09:10.158
and he's my property,
so we win.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.594
- Yeah, works for me.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.117
Time for
the big wrap-up speech.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.684
I'm sure you're all wondering
how we pulled this off.

09:14.728 --> 09:17.382
- No, we continue the heist
right here, right now.

09:17.426 --> 09:18.645
I'm gonna open him up.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.342
- No, no, no, no,
there's no need to operate.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.735
The gems are small enough.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.475
He should be able to excrete
them without discomfort.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.608
- The medical term
for excrete is dump out.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.044
- It is not.
- Hm?

09:27.088 --> 09:29.264
- Okay, so we wait
until Cheddar passes the gems,

09:29.307 --> 09:30.439
and then we restart the heist

09:30.482 --> 09:31.614
the next time
we all have a free day.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.312
- Perfect.
When will that be?

09:34.356 --> 09:35.575
- Ladies and gentlemen,

09:35.618 --> 09:38.752
welcome to the Valentine's Day
Halloween heist.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.406
- This is still happening?
- Why so curious, Terry?

09:41.450 --> 09:42.756
Hoping we'll let you
participate now?

09:42.799 --> 09:44.540
'Cause you can't!
- Oh, no.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.194
I don't get to compete
for a bunch of stones

09:46.237 --> 09:48.152
that were in a dog's butt.
What will I do?

09:48.196 --> 09:50.154
- I'll have you know
that a dog's butt is cleaner

09:50.198 --> 09:51.634
than a human's mouth.
- That can't be true.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.071
- Well, a dog's mouth is
cleaner than a human's mouth,

09:54.115 --> 09:55.420
and dog mouths lick dog butts,

09:55.464 --> 09:58.293
so you tell me
where my theory is wrong.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.729
- He has no comeback.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.339
- All right, the heist
will pick up where we left off.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.820
There are six hours remaining
and three teams left.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.649
The now-sterilized
Infinitude Gems

10:06.693 --> 10:08.738
will be placed
back into the care of Bill.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.697
Oh, wow, Bill, looks like
you had a rough four months.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.699
- It was actually
a great three months

10:12.742 --> 10:15.397
and then one really bad one.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.529
- Okay, but you're here,
and you're happier than ever.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.835
- I don't know why
you think that.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.230
- Let the heist re-begin!

10:23.840 --> 10:27.191
- Okay, your smoke plan
was a disaster.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.193
- Yeah, because your dog
ate the gems.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.542
- Because you tripped
and dropped them.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.588
- Yeah, because someone
put a chair in my way

10:32.632 --> 10:33.589
that wasn't supposed
to be there.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.590
- I'm sorry.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.591
Are you accusing me
of something?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.679
- Was that not clear?

10:36.723 --> 10:37.985
Do you need me to say it
in Latin?

10:38.028 --> 10:39.769
I think you sabotage me.

10:39.813 --> 10:40.770
- I would never.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.032
I want to win,

10:42.076 --> 10:44.774
Which is why I'm initiating
Operation Fabius.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.516
- Okay.
That does sound kind of cool.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.909
- Well, it shouldn't.
I may have to change the name.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.607
Roman dictator
Fabius Maximus

10:51.651 --> 10:54.392
defeated Hannibal
by avoiding battle

10:54.436 --> 10:56.133
and exercising patience.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.526
- I can be patient.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.223
I just listened to you
talk about that Fabius guy

10:59.267 --> 11:00.485
for, like, four hours.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.618
- It was two sentences.
- Ugh, shut up.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.881
- And the infighting continues.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.622
- I guess Jake and I still have

11:06.666 --> 11:08.885
the only unbreakable bond
in the whole precinct.

11:08.929 --> 11:11.453
- I mean, he is my husband.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.237
- Uh-huh.
No one ever gets divorced?

11:13.281 --> 11:14.543
- Charles.
- I'm sorry.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.327
I'm just all worked up
because of the heist.

11:16.371 --> 11:17.633
There's heist in the geist.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.852
- No, look.
There's something happening.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.810
- I have flowers
for Bill Hummertrout.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.160
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is a scam.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.336
There's no one in Bill's life
that would send him flowers.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.337
- It's true.
Something's up.

11:26.381 --> 11:27.382
- Flowers for Bill Hummertrout?

11:27.425 --> 11:28.818
- How many of these guys
are there?

11:28.862 --> 11:30.646
- Flowers for Bill...
- What is happening?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.995
- You tell us.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.388
You're the one who just
mysteriously appeared

11:33.431 --> 11:34.737
at this critical moment.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.478
- I was stuck
in the bathroom with Scully.

11:36.521 --> 11:37.958
It was a nightmare.
- For me too.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.481
Hitchcock and I haven't had
any time alone all day.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.917
I don't even know
what he had for lunch.

11:40.961 --> 11:43.180
- Italian sandwich.
- But with what kind of chips?

11:43.224 --> 11:44.355
- Okay, stop.
We don't have time for this.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.444
Everyone, form a blockade!
Protect Bill!

11:46.488 --> 11:47.837
Protect the gems!

11:47.881 --> 11:49.839
- I can't see anything.
There's too many of them.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.407
- Wait, they're clearing out.
- Yeah, because they got them.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.322
- The gems are gone.
- Of course they are.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.498
This is clearly the work
of Charles Boyle,

11:56.541 --> 11:58.239
the son of a florist.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.849
- You think I'd make bouquets
that look like this?

11:59.893 --> 12:02.286
With all this baby's-breath?
What do you think of me?

12:02.330 --> 12:04.854
- Maybe it was Terry
who sent the flowers!

12:04.898 --> 12:07.552
- Yeah, I really wanted
to spend $2,000

12:07.596 --> 12:09.380
on Valentine's Day
not for my wife.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.382
- Ah, he admitted it!
- No, Rosa took the gems.

12:11.426 --> 12:13.863
I saw you brush up against
one of the flower delivery men

12:13.907 --> 12:15.691
who handed you the gems,
which you gave to Scully,

12:15.735 --> 12:16.997
who placed them in his mouth.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.608
- That's absurd.
-  Yeah, that's absurd.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.741
- Okay, fine, but no one
is getting those gems.

12:21.784 --> 12:22.742
-  Yeah.

12:22.785 --> 12:23.917
- None of you
would dare to put

12:23.960 --> 12:25.005
your bare hands
inside of Scully's mouth.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.223
Yeah.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.398
- Who knows what kind
of diseases he's got.

12:27.442 --> 12:30.575
- My doctors sure don't.

12:30.619 --> 12:31.925
- Scully,
why wasn't that garbled?

12:31.968 --> 12:33.187
- Yep, he swallowed 'em.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.492
You can see the gems right here
on the X-ray.

12:34.536 --> 12:35.842
- And you're sure
those are the gems

12:35.885 --> 12:37.626
and there's not something
horribly wrong with him?

12:37.669 --> 12:39.410
- Well, the part that's
horribly wrong with him

12:39.454 --> 12:40.934
is if you look here--
- Oh, nobody cares.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.719
What does this mean
for the heist?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.199
- Ladies and gentlemen,

12:45.242 --> 12:48.811
welcome to the Easter
Valentine's Day Halloween heist!

12:52.249 --> 12:53.990
- We will once again pick up
where we left off.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.470
The Infinitude Gems--

12:55.513 --> 12:57.472
- You guys are still doing this?
You know it's April now.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.560
- Yeah, Terry,
we're still doing it,

12:58.603 --> 12:59.648
and we're still
having a great time.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.258
- Why are the gems so pale?

13:01.302 --> 13:02.564
- I guess
Scully's insides zapped

13:02.607 --> 13:04.044
all the color out of them?
I don't know, babe.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.436
You're undercutting
my whole thing with Terry here.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.657
Anyways, the Infinitude Gems
will go back to Bill

13:08.700 --> 13:11.225
whose life seems to have
unraveled even further.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.140
Tough March for you there, bud?
- Yeah, just a heads up.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.663
I sold my pants
with the pockets,

13:14.706 --> 13:16.708
so I'll be putting the gems
in my undies this time.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.623
No.
- I'll give him a fanny pack.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.147
- Can I keep it?

13:20.190 --> 13:21.626
This could be just what
I need to turn my life around.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.324
- Yeah, Bill,
you can keep the fanny pack.

13:23.367 --> 13:24.847
- I don't have to
do anything for it, do I?

13:24.891 --> 13:26.501
Because I will if you ask.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.938
I'll do anything, even...

13:30.810 --> 13:32.333
- What's that supposed
to represent?

13:32.376 --> 13:34.857
- No one answer that.
Anyhow, quick heist update.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.904
There's less than an hour left,
and only two teams remain.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.035
- Two?

13:39.079 --> 13:40.558
- My doctor said
I'm at a grave risk

13:40.602 --> 13:42.473
for a shenanigan-related death,
so I have to drop out.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.171
- That's not fair.
I should get a new partner.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.563
Terry, you want back in?
- Nope.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.827
I want my mango tango.
Slurp, slurp.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.611
- Sorry, Rosa,
if you wanna switch partners

13:49.654 --> 13:50.873
this late in the game,
they have to have

13:50.917 --> 13:52.353
the same skill set as Scully.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.398
- I'm available.
- Right, or...

13:55.922 --> 13:57.314
That filing cabinet
kind of looks like Scully.

13:57.358 --> 13:58.663
- I see it.
Same flat top.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.709
But if we really wanna
make this a fair switch,

14:00.752 --> 14:03.799
it seems like you need
to start in the men's room.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.541
- Come on.
- Let the heist re-re-begin!

14:10.980 --> 14:12.460
- Okay, in five minutes,

14:12.503 --> 14:14.505
ten other bunnies
will march past this door.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.855
We'll blend in
and grab the gems.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.247
It's foolproof.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.249
- How is this any different
than my bunny suit plan?

14:19.293 --> 14:20.729
- Oh, it's very different.

14:20.772 --> 14:23.340
I gave the bunnies glasses
and little, blue vests.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.515
- The vests add nothing.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.909
- The vests add gravitas.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.650
- Your butt adds gravitas.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.480
- Get ready.

14:32.523 --> 14:33.916
Bunnies are gonna be here
at any moment.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.439
- How do you know
this is their plan?

14:35.483 --> 14:36.788
- 'Cause Jake frickin' told me.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.355
- He did?
- Yeah.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.792
He's so frustrated with Holt--
like I knew he would be--

14:40.836 --> 14:42.751
that it's all he talks about...

14:42.794 --> 14:44.274
In therapy.

14:44.318 --> 14:45.580
- What?

14:45.623 --> 14:47.321
- The thing is,
the bunny vests do add gravitas,

14:47.364 --> 14:49.540
but I can't tell him that
'cause then he wins.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.847
Oh, hey, is it weird that
Jane Jetson gives me a bo--

14:51.891 --> 14:53.718
- You found a therapist
that let you do that?

14:53.762 --> 14:55.024
- No, I've been
paying an actress

14:55.068 --> 14:56.460
to pretend to treat him
for months.

14:56.504 --> 14:57.940
She's actually
helped him a lot.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.637
- Oh, did Jake ever say
anything about me

14:59.681 --> 15:00.725
while you were listening?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.033
- Where are those bunnies?

15:07.950 --> 15:09.865
- Boy, that thing's
pretty heavy, huh?

15:12.912 --> 15:16.611
- Here they come, my beautiful,
blue-vested bunnies.

15:16.654 --> 15:17.873
- My God, they're so cool.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.874
- What's that?
- Hm?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.136
Nothing.
I hate them.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.486
This probably won't even work.
- Let's go.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.619
- It's happening.
Put on your head.

15:24.662 --> 15:25.620
- Oh, with pleasure.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.404
I love disappearing
into a role.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.016
I'm Argyle James Hopford,
a bachelor bunny

15:30.059 --> 15:32.583
who's carrying out a scandalous
affair with a local goose.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.498
- Shut up and put on
your damn head!

15:34.542 --> 15:35.935
- Hello, bunnies.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.806
- Okay, just be cool
and blend in.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.504
- Jake, who are those bunnies?
- It must be Amy and Charles.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.636
- They see us.
Let's go.

15:41.679 --> 15:42.637
- Give it up, Bill!
Give it up!

15:42.680 --> 15:44.291
- Come on, Holt, move your ass.

15:44.334 --> 15:45.640
- No, I can't unclasp the fanny
pack with these furry hands.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.207
- You're hitting me, Jake.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.686
- I can't see anything,
and we're all dressed the same.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.732
- Uh-oh, Rosa's coming.
- And Bill's getting away.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.081
- Nope, I got his ankle.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.518
- Get off me!
Get off me!

15:54.562 --> 15:56.042
- Someone got the fanny pack!

15:56.085 --> 15:57.782
- They're headed for the roof!

15:57.826 --> 15:59.523
- Go, go, go, go, go.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.747
- This is still going on?
- Was it Terry?

16:05.790 --> 16:07.967
- Nope.
Wasn't me.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.970
- Wait, if you're Terry,
then that must be...

16:15.539 --> 16:16.888
- What's up, losers?

16:21.893 --> 16:23.243
- Yes.
- Whoo!

16:23.286 --> 16:25.027
- Wow.
- Whoo.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.203
- Rosa, that was amazing.
- It was not amazing.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.770
She didn't stay handcuffed
to her partner.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.076
She's disqualified.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.730
We'll reset and start over
on the next holiday.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.732
Earth day--an Earth day heist.

16:34.776 --> 16:35.907
It's perfect.
- Wrong.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.213
Rules said I couldn't
undo the cuffs,

16:37.257 --> 16:38.214
and I didn't.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.737
- Oh, not fair.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.043
I didn't know I could
cut off Peralta's hand.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.218
I'll file that away
for next year.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.567
- Actually, I think
we're one and done

16:43.611 --> 16:44.873
on the whole handcuff concept.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.570
- This is incredible.
How'd you do it, Rosa?

16:46.614 --> 16:48.181
- Well, back on Halloween,

16:48.224 --> 16:50.357
I knew Jake would make the first
move, and I had to be ready.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.706
- You were hiding in the fog.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.229
It wasn't Holt that put
that chair in my pathway.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.796
- No, I did.

16:54.839 --> 16:57.712
I wanted to be the one who was
responsible for our victory.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.192
- What?
- We already lost.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.237
There's no point in trying
to maintain team morale now.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.760
- Dick.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.066
- Anyway, I knew Cheddar
would be making an appearance.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.025
- Oh, everyone loves
to see Cheddar.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.678
- He's here a lot.
I never bring in Arlo.

17:07.722 --> 17:08.853
- Who?
- Exactly.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.072
I spent every morning
for the last year

17:10.116 --> 17:11.595
giving Cheddar
a taste for ham.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.249
- Oh, so that's why
he got so thick

17:13.293 --> 17:15.077
and ended up on "Chonky Pups."

17:15.121 --> 17:16.470
- I submitted his photo.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.167
And once you put Cheddar
on a diet, all I had to do

17:18.211 --> 17:20.604
was mark the gems with a little
of that sweet ham taste.

17:20.648 --> 17:21.997
- Why did you want Cheddar
to swallow the gems?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.607
- Because I needed
to delay things.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.696
The second part of my plan
took place on Valentine's Day,

17:25.740 --> 17:27.220
which went perfectly.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.613
- Ah, I wouldn't say perfectly.
Scully swallowed the gems.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.093
- 'Cause I tricked him into it.
Wasn't hard.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.747
Pretty much used
the same Cheddar ham playbook.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.053
- Table ham.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.664
Seven days in a row.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.883
So now I have to think twice
before I eat food

17:38.927 --> 17:40.929
I find lying around.
Thanks a lot.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.670
- I marked the gems
with ham again,

17:42.713 --> 17:44.237
and everything pushed to Easter
when I could finally

17:44.280 --> 17:45.803
get rid of Scully
as my partner.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.283
- Doctor,
I'm willing to pay you

17:47.327 --> 17:49.111
to tell Norm Scully
not to participate--

17:49.155 --> 17:50.417
- Participate?
No, no, no.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.983
Norm Scully should not
be participating

17:52.027 --> 17:53.246
in any activities.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.856
He could die.
I'll go call him right now.

17:54.899 --> 17:57.293
- Now I finally had a teammate
whose hand I could cut off.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.121
Just needed a little help
from Terry.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.080
- Boy, that thing's
pretty heavy, huh?

18:01.123 --> 18:03.125
- Did you bring the tools?

18:03.169 --> 18:05.780
- But you were retired.
You were loving your smoothies.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.695
- Yeah, but after a while,
I felt left out.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.044
And if I'm being honest,

18:09.088 --> 18:10.045
the smoothies
weren't even that good.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.394
- I wonder why that was.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.353
Maybe it's because
I hammed your smoothie.

18:13.396 --> 18:16.138
- Am I the only one who didn't
get fed ham this year?

18:16.182 --> 18:18.227
- Wait, how did you know
about Jake's bunny plan?

18:18.271 --> 18:20.142
- You weren't the only one
listening in on his therapy.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.144
- Of course the bunnies
should have glasses.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.015
I just can't believe I didn't
come up with it myself.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.060
Oh, you know what?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.192
Betty Rubble
also gives me a bo--

18:26.235 --> 18:28.019
You guys were listening in
on my therapy?

18:28.063 --> 18:29.978
That feels like
a real violation--

18:30.021 --> 18:31.762
- Jake, Jake,
this is Rosa's moment.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.851
- Yeah, man, go tell it
to your fake therapist.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.114
- She's fake?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.506
- Anyway,
then I grabbed the gems,

18:36.550 --> 18:38.029
jumped off the roof,
and wrote my name in flames.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.727
- Wait, why did you keep
delaying the heist?

18:39.770 --> 18:41.337
Couldn't you have just won
at Halloween?

18:41.381 --> 18:42.860
- Oh, I did.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.862
These are the real
Halloween gems.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.951
I switched them out
before Cheddar found them.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.910
I also won on Valentine's Day.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.520
What is happening?

18:50.564 --> 18:52.218
I switched those gems out
before I gave them to Scully.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.220
And then I won today.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.309
So while you nerds
are always arguing

18:56.352 --> 18:57.962
about who the only
two-time champion is...

18:58.006 --> 18:59.268
Me.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.749
- I just became the first
three-time champion.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.446
I guess there's just
one thing left to do.

19:03.490 --> 19:07.189
- To Rosa Diaz,
an amazing human/genius.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.104
To Rosa Diaz.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.759
- Well, you did it,
but always remember one thing.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.369
Those gems
were in Scully's butt.

19:13.413 --> 19:14.849
- How dare you.
- I know.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.024
I'm happy for you, I guess.
I don't know.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.504
- Hold on.
I have some math questions.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.071
If Rosa has three wins,
does Scully have two?

19:20.115 --> 19:21.986
Am I now tied with Scully?
- No, no, no.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.074
I'm tied with Scully.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.337
You're tied with
the filing cabinet.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.208
- The filing cabinet
has more wins than me?

19:26.252 --> 19:27.383
- Yes, obviously.
- Yeah, that's how that works.

19:27.427 --> 19:28.776
- As it should.
- Guys, stop it.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.212
We're supposed to be
celebrating Rosa here,

19:30.256 --> 19:32.083
not fighting.
- No, no, keep fighting.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.694
It's why I did this.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.913
You know, technically, we all
shared in Jake's first win,

19:35.957 --> 19:37.132
so this might be my fourth.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.133
- What?
No.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.221
- Yeah, that's a good point.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.136
- Oh, we also helped
Holt win too.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.312
- Oh, shut up, Santiago.
Just shut up.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.532
- Excuse me?
- Wow, shut up?

19:45.575 --> 19:47.098
- How dare you, sir.
- I won two times.

19:47.142 --> 19:50.276
- That is my wife.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.280
- Not a doctor.
Shh.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.369
- Fremulon.
