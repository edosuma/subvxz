00:03.600 --> 00:05.318
You gotta let that guy know, back off.

00:05.480 --> 00:08.074
That is Marissa's letter.
That you stole from her locker? 

00:08.240 --> 00:09.434
If she finds out, you guys are done.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.875
- The interior design job, I want it.
- We've found our girl.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.076
Am I dating the female me?
Like me, but as a girl?

00:14.240 --> 00:16.276
People can be really unpredictable.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.714
I can't believe you stole it.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.598
How can you say
he's not in love with you?

00:19.760 --> 00:20.988
I can't do this anymore.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.310
You and Marissa aren't supposed
to be together.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.278
- I am not gonna let this happen.
- Who's gonna believe you?

00:27.640 --> 00:29.710
Stay away from her!

00:40.480 --> 00:41.959
You're not having breakfast?

00:42.480 --> 00:44.072
Not really hungry.

00:44.960 --> 00:49.351
Dr. Kim just called to let us know
that you've been suspended, indefinitely.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.078
Until the disciplinary committee...

00:51.240 --> 00:53.356
...can figure out whether or not
they want to expel you.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.398
I know you want me to say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.232
Oliver admitted it. Right to my face.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.868
He told me he wanted me gone
so he could get to Marissa.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.994
Then why would he drop
the assault charges against you?

01:06.040 --> 01:07.553
- He did that?
- Yeah.

01:07.720 --> 01:10.314
I mean, it seems to me
that if he had it in for you...

01:10.480 --> 01:13.040
...if he wanted you gone,
you'd be back in juvie already.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.111
I mean, you know that, right?

01:16.920 --> 01:18.876
Come on, help me out here, would you?

01:19.040 --> 01:21.110
Tell me what's going on.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.754
Oliver's dangerous.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.559
This is what I know:

01:27.280 --> 01:30.590
You attacked him. Period.
You're on probation.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.593
You knew the slightest infraction would
result in you being taken from us.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.478
And you did it anyway.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.234
For the life of me,
I can't understand why.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.913
Talk to me.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.476
Come on, Ryan, talk to me.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.557
What's the point?
You won't believe me.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.915
It's not about what I believe.
I wish it was.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.991
It's about what you did.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.510
The next time you feel
like raising your fist...

01:52.680 --> 01:55.877
...you had better open your mouth
and talk.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.232
I'm here for that.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.392
What am I supposed to do?

02:07.560 --> 02:10.711
I can't ground you.
I'm not gonna chain you to the wall.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.630
You want to go after that Oliver kid?

02:14.400 --> 02:17.676
Go ahead. The door's open.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.993
But if you want to stay,
if you want to be part of this family...

02:23.160 --> 02:25.355
...you're not gonna go anywhere
or do anything...

02:25.520 --> 02:28.512
...you're not gonna see anyone,
unless Kirsten and I say it's okay.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.318
That's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.030
So Ryan just, like,
punched him for no reason?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.997
That's what Ryan does.
He punches people.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.913
He doesn't talk to them,
and he doesn't listen.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.513
He had to have a reason, though.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.911
I mean, yeah, Ryan's violent,
but he's not stupid.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.919
He just...

03:49.080 --> 03:52.959
I don't know. He thinks Oliver's
in love with me or something.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.553
Well, isn't he?

03:54.720 --> 03:56.039
- A little?
- We're just friends.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.633
Okay!

03:57.800 --> 04:00.792
I mean, Oliver's, like, the only guy
in my life who isn't jealous...

04:00.960 --> 04:03.520
...and scary and breathing
down my neck all the time.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.591
And he actually tells me
what he's thinking.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.113
Unlike some people.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.919
So are you and Ryan...?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.079
We broke up.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.639
Whoa, Coop.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.478
So that means that
we're both single now.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.834
Which...

04:20.000 --> 04:21.877
...rocks! Right?

04:22.040 --> 04:23.189
No more Ryan.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.318
No more Seth Cohen.
We're totally free. Liberated.

04:26.480 --> 04:30.393
In fact, how about I treat us both to
a little Burke Williams today after school?

04:30.560 --> 04:32.630
A little facial, a little massage...

04:32.800 --> 04:35.519
I can't. I promised Oliver
I'd help him study after school.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.352
Oh. Well, how about this weekend?

04:37.520 --> 04:39.238
My dad's taking Kaitlin to my grandma's...

04:39.400 --> 04:41.436
...and I have to spend the weekend
at my mom's.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.273
Apparently, she's got this
mother-daughter marathon planned.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.555
- Well, then when are we gonna hang out?
- Soon.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.593
Hey, you coming?

04:57.080 --> 05:00.789
Well, even if Ryan gets expelled,
he's still gonna live with you guys, right?

05:00.960 --> 05:03.554
- Your parents aren't gonna kick him out.
- No.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.233
I don't think so.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.719
Well, is he okay?

05:06.880 --> 05:08.916
He's not the one
who got punched in the face.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.957
I'm talking about
in the larger sense, Seth.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.315
I guess. I don't really know.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.077
- Haven't you talked to him?
- No. What am I supposed to say?

05:18.240 --> 05:21.198
I don't know. "Are you okay?"
"Is there anything I can do?"

05:21.360 --> 05:23.078
That's the thing.
There's nothing I can do.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.277
I begged him to stay away from Oliver,
and he didn't listen to me.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.352
Look, you don't know Ryan that well,
okay? You don't understand.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.158
I'm trying.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.508
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.072
- How is everybody?
- Good.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.309
- Good.
- Good.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.072
Good.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.919
Okay, this is really...

05:51.080 --> 05:52.195
- Weird?
- Yeah.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.079
- Just because you and Ryan aren't...
- Doesn't mean we can't...

05:55.240 --> 05:56.514
- Exactly.
- Right.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.557
- So is he okay?
- What up? What up?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.592
So, what are we doing this weekend?

06:03.760 --> 06:05.034
Ski trip? Mammoth?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.714
Six to 8 inches
of fresh powder tomorrow.

06:07.880 --> 06:08.949
Oliver, your lip.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.112
I was hoping it had already made
the transition from scary to sexy.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.714
Not yet, huh?

06:15.880 --> 06:18.678
- Walk you to Western civ?
- Sure.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.229
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.394
- Wow. Oliver seems almost...
- Happy?

06:26.560 --> 06:30.553
Yeah, well, why shouldn't he?
He has Marissa all to himself now.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.473
What?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.591
I think I made a mistake.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.716
- By leaving Ryan home alone?
- By bringing him home in the first place.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.155
Sandy, he's a good kid.
He's not perfect.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.278
But we'll work it out. We always do.
Everything's gonna be okay.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.670
Who'd have ever thought
you'd be telling me that?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.672
- Kirsten Cohen?
- Yes.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.353
- You shouldn't be here.
- I'm sorry?

06:56.520 --> 06:58.988
We have a work order from Julie Cooper.
Excuse me, sir.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.831
There must be a mistake.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.675
What are you doing here?
You were going to lunch.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.400
- We ordered in. Deli?
- Oh, hi, Sandy. No, thank you.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.232
Julie, what is going on?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.630
Well, as the Newport Group's
new design director...

07:11.800 --> 07:14.360
...I've decided to give the office
a much-needed facelift.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.592
Wait till you see your furniture, Kiki.
It's very fresh. Very Danish.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.239
- Very "hello."
- I'm sure it is...

07:19.400 --> 07:21.516
...but you can't just initiate a redesign.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.955
- You need approvals.
- Caleb said it was okay.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.951
Oh, if Caleb said it was okay...

07:28.160 --> 07:29.309
My coffee table!

07:29.480 --> 07:31.755
Kiki, what's going on?
Some man in a jumpsuit...

07:31.920 --> 07:33.717
...just made off with my massage chair.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.599
I want my chair. I want my desk.
I want my office back.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.593
By the time we get back from lunch,
you'll have it and love it.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.150
You want to join us to celebrate
my new position?

07:42.440 --> 07:43.953
Oh, I'm not gonna touch that one.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.119
- No, we're okay.
- Okay.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.036
I have work to do.

07:52.200 --> 07:56.637
Don't worry, honey. You said it yourself.
Everything's gonna be fine.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.911
Come on. You have to go.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.469
We both could use the weekend away.
It'll be my treat.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.234
I can't. Besides, I'm the one
who should be treating you.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.630
You wouldn't have gotten hurt
if it weren't for me.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.153
Hey, that was Ryan, not you.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.198
What did we learn in therapy?

08:36.559 --> 08:39.552
Say it with me now.
"We are responsible for our own actions."

08:40.400 --> 08:41.799
Hey, what's up?

08:41.960 --> 08:44.520
Luke, help me convince Marissa
to come to Mammoth with us.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.159
- Who's going to Mammoth?
- Not me.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.709
My dad's out of town,
so I'm gonna be at my mom's.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.236
Which means she'll be next to Ryan,
which is not good for her right now.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.518
- Well, isn't that kind of up to Marissa?
- Look, it's not a big deal. It's fine.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.036
Okay, so let me at least get you
and your mom a suite at the hotel.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.710
That way I'll be there, and you won't
even have to think about Ryan.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.350
Look, this is probably her now,
already checking up on me.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.397
- It's Ryan, isn't it?
- You're not gonna get it?

09:15.560 --> 09:18.028
- She's not talking to Ryan.
- Is she talking to me?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.270
- Or are you doing her talking now?
- Luke, don't.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.237
- Marissa...
- I should probably just go.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.833
Stay.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.236
You two enjoy your lunch.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.752
I am so sorry.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.358
I guess I can just get a little
overprotective sometimes.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.274
- But I would never presume to...
- I know. It's okay. Really.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.269
Why don't I just go get us some dessert.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.873
<i>You have one new message.</i>

09:59.040 --> 10:02.874
<i>Hey, I was hoping maybe we could talk,</i>
<i>face to face, if you want.</i>

10:03.040 --> 10:06.077
<i>So I'll meet you in the library</i>
<i>after school, and I hope...</i>

10:06.240 --> 10:08.310
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

10:08.480 --> 10:13.759
<i>To save the message, press two.</i>
<i>To erase the message, press three.</i>

10:14.720 --> 10:16.676
<i>Message deleted.</i>

10:21.560 --> 10:24.791
So, what's the plan? Comic books first?
Or frozen yogurt?

10:24.960 --> 10:27.315
You think it's cool
if we do the comics run tomorrow?

10:27.480 --> 10:30.119
I thought it'd be better
if I went home to check on Ryan.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.750
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Do you want some company?

10:33.920 --> 10:36.878
- Hey. Where are you guys going?
- Well, we were talking about...

10:37.040 --> 10:39.918
...maybe going to the comic-book store...
- Really?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.358
Can I come?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.079
To the comic-book store?

10:44.240 --> 10:46.435
Yeah. I like comics. Sort of.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.192
You do?

10:48.360 --> 10:51.238
Believe it or not, Betty and Veronica
had a huge influence on me.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.956
You know what, I do believe that.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.834
I believe it too.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.753
Besides, Marissa has Oliver now...

10:58.920 --> 11:02.390
...and I have a whole afternoon to kill.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.389
So, great.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.039
- You'll spend it with us.
- Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.195
Except, don't you have to go
check on Ryan?

11:11.480 --> 11:12.629
Well, I...

11:15.760 --> 11:17.273
Excuse me.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.039
Hey. What are you doing here?

11:19.200 --> 11:22.112
- I'm supposed to meet Marissa.
- Okay, but here? In broad daylight?

11:22.280 --> 11:25.238
- In front of God, Dr. Kim and everyone?
- She's not taking my calls.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.277
This is the only place
I knew I could see her.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.759
Does Marissa know about this?

11:29.240 --> 11:31.356
You'd think you, of all people,
would believe me.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.999
Ryan, Marissa's a big girl.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.594
You can't tell her who
she can and can't hang out with.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.435
Oliver's not stable. He's dangerous. One
girl got a restraining order against him.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.068
Natalie? Either she lives
in Niagara Falls or doesn't exist.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.391
- I'm sure he's not making up girlfriends.
- Seth, he's crazy.

11:45.560 --> 11:47.949
Okay. Okay. Fine. He's crazy.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.076
But this <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
act you're pulling...

11:50.240 --> 11:53.755
...it's not the way to make your case.
- I have to go.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.998
She's not coming.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.829
She asked me to tell you not to call her
anymore and not to try and see her.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.468
If you do, she'll get a restraining order
against you.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.473
- Really? What's that like?
- It's not my fault she won't see you.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.154
I mean, you spied on her.
You stole from her.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.392
- You beat up one of her best friends.
- I'd do it again too. Right now.

12:24.560 --> 12:28.075
I could've pressed charges, but I didn't.
I'm trying to help you.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.437
But if you keep this up,
no one's gonna be able to save you.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.433
Give it up, buddy. It's over.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.152
Hey, Oliver.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.468
It hasn't even begun.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.274
I need my office back
by the end of the day, Brian.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.955
If Julie Cooper asks you to do anything
else, you nod your head and do nothing.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.314
Thanks.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.232
- Have you seen the coffee?
- Very funny.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.597
- In the meantime, I have no place to work.
- Yeah, I have no place to eat.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.196
Her first day, and Julie has displaced
half the staff from their offices...

13:09.360 --> 13:13.114
...and personally alienated the other half.
She's driving everyone crazy.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.953
Including me. Please talk to her,
before I starve to death.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.157
You can't talk to Julie Cooper.
She's Julie Cooper.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.436
Talk to your dad.
He's the reason she's there.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.353
I know, but then he'll think
it's personal or that I'm jealous.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.192
I can't talk to my father.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.874
You don't mind if I work
out of the house, do you?

13:29.880 --> 13:32.758
- Sorry, I thought if there was coffee...
- Oh, Ryan, come on in.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.434
There's coffee and cereal and...

13:36.520 --> 13:38.272
...a model home.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.670
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.710
He didn't leave the pool house
all day yesterday.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.348
- Maybe we're being too hard on him.
- We gotta hang tough.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.990
- It's for his own good.
- Then why do I feel so bad?

13:57.440 --> 13:59.556
Kirsten. You're not dressed.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.438
- Julie.
- We could carpool from now on.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.989
We're next door.
Have you read the latest EPA figures?

14:04.160 --> 14:07.516
What we're doing to the environment?
Sandy, I can see you hiding.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.830
Not hiding, Julie.
Just making myself presentable.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.275
- Don't go to any trouble for me.
- Don't worry.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.078
Kirsten, you're still not dressed.

14:14.240 --> 14:19.075
Yes, well, I was planning on working from
the house today, since my office is still...

14:19.240 --> 14:21.595
Honey, weren't you supposed
to meet with Caleb...

14:21.760 --> 14:24.228
...to talk about the thing?

14:25.160 --> 14:27.310
- It can wait.
- So can Julie. Grab a shower.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.550
- I can get Julie some coffee.
- I'll help myself.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.517
- Is it flavored?
- No.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.477
Go ahead. Go.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.879
Aren't you late for school?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.997
- I got suspended.
- Oh, what a surprise.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.515
Who'd you beat up this time? Dr. Kim?

14:50.680 --> 14:52.989
I guess you and Marissa
haven't talked in a while.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.151
Well, as a matter of fact,
she'll be spending the weekend with me.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.389
She will?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.075
I guess you and Marissa
haven't talked in a while.

15:04.720 --> 15:08.679
Look, I know you and I haven't always
agreed when it comes to Marissa...

15:08.840 --> 15:11.752
...but I'm asking you, please,
keep her away from this kid Oliver.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.596
He's not well.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.313
Really?

15:17.920 --> 15:20.195
The boy who lives in the pool house
is warning me...

15:20.360 --> 15:22.999
...about the boy
who lives in the penthouse?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.319
He's got this thing that he does.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.994
He locks into a girl,
thinks she'll make everything okay.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.912
And when she can't, he loses it.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.799
I am not getting involved
in the throes of teenage romance.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.155
He cut his wrists last year
because of a girl.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.390
When his girlfriend Natalie
broke up with him...

15:37.560 --> 15:39.915
...he got busted for trying to buy cocaine.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.433
It's true. You can ask Marissa.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.672
- Julie, you ready?
- Yeah.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.552
Stay out of trouble, Ryan.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.429
- What did your mom say about Mammoth?
- I didn't ask her yet.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.359
I'm sorry. I just...

16:04.520 --> 16:07.512
I try not to talk to my mom
as much as possible.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.956
Look, if you don't want to hang out
with me this weekend, that's fine.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.031
- What?
- It's okay if you don't.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.636
Just tell me. Because after
what happened with me and Natalie...

16:16.800 --> 16:19.155
I do want to hang out with you.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.869
Believe me, there's nothing I'd rather do
than just blow everything off...

16:23.040 --> 16:25.793
...school, therapy, my mom,
and hang out with you.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.078
- But I've got so...
- You mean it?

16:28.440 --> 16:29.919
Seriously?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.951
Then let's do it.
Let's blow it off.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.519
All right. We can drive to L.A.

16:34.680 --> 16:38.514
We can have lunch at the Ivy,
do the Getty, swing by the Troubadour.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.391
It sounds perfect,
except my mom would kill me.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.710
I'm supposed to have dinner
with her tonight.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.871
What if I get you back by dinner?

16:47.040 --> 16:50.191
- Come on. You know you want to.
- Stop it.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.749
- What about therapy?
- Oh, you don't need therapy.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.230
From what you told me, your mom's
the one who needs therapy, right?

16:57.480 --> 16:59.596
Promise I'll be back before dinner?

17:08.240 --> 17:10.117
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.953
- But I don't trust that dude.
- Stop it. You sound like Ryan.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.438
- You've met Natalie, right?
- Oliver's ex, Natalie?

17:17.599 --> 17:18.953
No. You?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.150
No. Ryan thinks he made her up.

17:26.599 --> 17:30.229
Oliver said she went to Pacific, right?
I've got friends there. I can just ask.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.597
- You don't think that's a little crazy?
- Dude, have you met Oliver?

17:36.480 --> 17:40.268
- Dad, do you have a minute?
- Exactly one.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.153
It's about Julie.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.552
Close the door.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.631
She's driving me crazy.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.598
- Excuse me?
- Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the woman.

17:57.760 --> 18:01.435
But not every living minute of the day.
She's there every time I turn around.

18:01.600 --> 18:05.149
At home, in the office. I wouldn't
be surprised if she wasn't in here now.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.878
Dad, you're the one who hired her.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.714
I gave her something to do,
so she'd stop calling me.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.952
Well, it worked. Now she doesn't
have to call you. She's always here.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.032
Which is why I want you to talk to her.
I know she's your friend...

18:16.200 --> 18:19.909
...but in the interest of the business,
not to mention your father's sanity...

18:20.080 --> 18:21.752
...this has to end.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.592
What are you talking about?
The job?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.838
- You want me to break up with her?
- I knew you'd understand.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.834
Hey.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.830
So Summer and Anna are both here.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.515
Summer is about to read her first comic.
I knew you wouldn't want to miss that.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.318
Let me know how it goes.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.870
Okay. Well, I can see you're busy.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.837
Why don't you invite over Oliver?

18:53.400 --> 18:56.790
- Natalie, if you can find her.
- Yeah. Maybe I'll do that.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.355
- Hey, guys. What are you doing?
- Hey.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.671
Believe it or not, Summer has shown
a latent interest in comic bookery.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.796
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.111
- Where's Ryan?
- I invited him to join us...

19:13.280 --> 19:15.350
...but he's staying
in the Fortress of Solitude.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.715
- <i>Superman</i> reference.
- I knew that.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.790
So I'm gonna start you off
with some basics:

19:20.960 --> 19:23.030
<i>Batman</i> : <i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>.
Very important.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.156
<i>Watchman</i> and <i>The Sandman.</i>

19:25.480 --> 19:26.799
Enjoy.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.189
- Seth?
- Yeah.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.238
Don't you want to start
on something less grim and gritty?

19:31.400 --> 19:33.789
- Like what?
- Like the <i>Archie</i> s?

19:34.480 --> 19:35.674
Anna. The <i>Archie</i> s?

19:35.840 --> 19:39.674
Hey, I'm with Anna. Life's gritty enough.
Comic books are for fun.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.110
Life's gritty enough?
We live in Newport Beach.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.190
- Hey, Mr. Cohen?
- Yes?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.316
Did you read comic books
when you were a kid?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.916
- Oh, yeah. Sure. I mean, not like Seth.
- I know.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.072
You have no idea how rare it is
to find another comic-book person.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.879
Especially one who loves Death Cab
and sailing.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.396
- I thought I was the only one.
- I thought Seth was the only one.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.517
Death Cab is a band, yes?

20:03.920 --> 20:05.911
Guys? Seth!

20:06.160 --> 20:09.436
- Can you help me with the groceries?
- Yeah, yeah. In a minute.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.558
So I guess you and Mrs. Cohen
have a lot in common, huh?

20:12.720 --> 20:16.474
Oh, yeah, sure. We both love...

20:18.560 --> 20:21.836
...Seth. So I guess we don't
have a lot in common.

20:24.200 --> 20:28.671
Well, then what do you think is the key
to a successful relationship?

20:28.840 --> 20:30.990
The sooner we get the bags,
the sooner we eat.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.479
Coming.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.791
Well, I think as far as Cohen men
are concerned, the key...

20:35.960 --> 20:38.679
...is patience.
- Patience?

20:39.440 --> 20:41.749
Hey, Dad. Is it cool if Summer
stays for dinner?

20:44.640 --> 20:47.029
- I'm gonna get the groceries.
- All right. Thanks.

20:49.520 --> 20:52.557
- Come on, man. What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

20:54.720 --> 20:56.358
These are crazy people.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.952
Luke! What are you doing here?
Besides relieving me of grocery duty.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.192
I hadn't seen Ryan in a while,
so I thought I'd stop by and say hey.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.429
Is that okay?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.875
I can't stay.
I have to go have dinner with my dad.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.873
- But there's something you should know.
- What?

21:10.040 --> 21:12.474
I saw Marissa leave school today
with Oliver.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.552
They skipped the whole day.
And I tried her on her cell, but...

21:15.720 --> 21:17.551
- You don't know where they went?
- No.

21:18.040 --> 21:22.556
And I'm sure she's probably fine, right?
But there's something about that kid.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.318
So I went over to Pacific after school.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.152
I know guys
on the water-polo team there.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.799
I figured I'd ask what they knew.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.951
What was he like
when he went to Pacific?

21:31.120 --> 21:33.156
Did they even know him?
Did they know Natalie?

21:33.640 --> 21:34.959
Well, it turns out...

21:35.680 --> 21:37.511
...there is no Natalie.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.914
At least not at Pacific High.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.073
- Are you sure it's okay that I'm staying?
- Oh, absolutely.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.117
We have more than enough
for everybody.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.475
I don't know where
we're gonna put it all.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.835
Eventually, in my belly.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.995
- You go ahead and start without me.
- Okay.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.114
I'll go get Ryan.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.513
What are you doing at my house?
You have to leave. I mean it.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.910
- I have to tell you something.
- You went to my mom.

22:33.080 --> 22:36.231
She called the school. She called
the hotel looking for Oliver's parents.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.356
- Let me talk to you.
- Why do you hate him?

22:38.520 --> 22:39.748
What did he ever do to you?

22:40.440 --> 22:41.953
There is no Natalie.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.634
You're becoming pathetic.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.233
Ask him.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.558
Ask him to show you his yearbook.
She's not there. She's not real.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.914
He made her up.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.911
Marissa, inside.
You're in big trouble.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.674
- Ryan, go home.
- No. You know what, Ryan? You stay.

22:54.840 --> 22:55.989
I'm going.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.357
Marissa. Marissa, get back here!

23:00.160 --> 23:01.878
Get back here!

23:25.400 --> 23:27.436
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.954
Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

23:54.320 --> 23:56.072
I thought you might
want some breakfast.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.832
Thanks.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.350
I shouldn't have gone over
there last night.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.798
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Not really.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.713
Ryan...

24:26.120 --> 24:29.078
...I promise I will do everything
I can to help you.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.231
But I can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.591
You don't tell me what's going on.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.715
Ryan, I thought you might like some...

24:38.480 --> 24:39.913
Coffee.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.674
- Great minds.
- Luke's here to see you.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.712
Thanks, you guys.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.834
Hey, man.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.789
So how did it go last night?
What'd she say?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.393
She didn't believe me.

25:00.560 --> 25:03.028
- Then her mom started in, and she ran.
- To Oliver's?

25:03.200 --> 25:04.713
I don't know.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.355
- So let's go find out.
- And then what?

25:07.520 --> 25:09.988
- She wants to be with him.
- You're just gonna give up?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.913
What else can I do?
She won't listen to a word I have to say.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.469
Well, she's gonna listen to me.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.032
See you.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.591
So if we leave for L.A.
After our massages...

25:28.760 --> 25:30.990
...we can check into my parents' suite
around 2.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.189
Wait. Your parents have
their own suite in L.A. Too?

25:34.360 --> 25:36.555
They have private suites
in all their hotels.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.553
- London, Paris...
- Oh, I wish we could go to Paris.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.075
We can. It's only 15 hours away.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.950
Yeah. As long as we're back
by Monday, right?

25:46.120 --> 25:49.476
Look, if you don't want to go,
just say so.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.154
- We don't have to.
- No, I do. I just can't.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.039
Why not? You've been saying you wanted
to get away from your mom...

25:55.200 --> 25:56.315
...and from Ryan.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.272
This way it'll just be you and me.

25:58.440 --> 25:59.714
In Paris.

26:00.880 --> 26:03.269
Hey, don't answer that.
It's probably your mom.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.079
It's Luke.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.958
- Hey.
- Marissa...

26:08.160 --> 26:10.116
- Where are you?
- I'm at the hotel.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.077
- Why is he calling?
- <i>You gotta listen to me.</i>

26:12.240 --> 26:14.071
There is no Natalie Bishop.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.037
- <i>Ryan was right.</i>
- Luke, don't you start.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.832
<i>I'm trying to help you, Marissa.</i>

26:18.000 --> 26:20.673
You want to help? Go to my mom's
and tell her I'm fine.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.036
- Marissa...
- Luke, please.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.237
I'll be there soon.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.398
He's just dropping off some clothes.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.033
If you don't want to stay...

26:35.200 --> 26:36.394
No, I do.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.233
I do. I just can't fly to Paris right now.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.958
I'm sorry.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.949
Well, it's cold right now anyway.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.678
We'll go in the spring.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.160
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, don't look. It's not finished.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.709
I wanted you to be surprised on Monday.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.479
I am.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.073
Julie, it's gorgeous.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.673
Did you do all this today?

27:08.200 --> 27:11.033
I was supposed to have Marissa
this weekend. That didn't happen.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.713
I haven't heard from your father.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.678
So then I thought, why not work, right?
Take my mind off things.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.638
Have you heard from your father?
Have you talked to him today?

27:18.800 --> 27:21.155
No, no, not today, but...

27:22.240 --> 27:24.674
But what? Is he all right?
Did something happen?

27:24.840 --> 27:26.432
No, he's fine.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.953
- It's just...
- What?

27:29.640 --> 27:31.153
He doesn't like confrontation.

27:33.440 --> 27:36.113
Julie, you want to sit down?

27:36.400 --> 27:38.868
Why? What's going on?

27:44.880 --> 27:46.279
No.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.956
Is...?

27:49.120 --> 27:50.473
Is he breaking up with me?

27:54.120 --> 27:56.509
Or are you doing it for him?

27:56.800 --> 27:59.189
Kiki, I saw your car.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.752
Hello, darling.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.836
- I tried to call you earlier, but...
- Don't bother, Cal.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.756
Kirsten's already done
your dirty work for you.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.996
Because obviously you're not man enough
to do it yourself.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.720
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.556
God. I deserve so much better from you.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.758
From both of you.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.870
Enjoy your office. I quit.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.792
Hello, ladies. Seth.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.951
- Dad, don't call me a lady.
- Hey, Mr. Cohen.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.633
Hey, Sandy.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.069
So the comic-book education continues?

28:49.120 --> 28:50.394
<i>Batman: The Animated Series.</i>

28:50.560 --> 28:53.711
Yes. "Girls' Night Out," in which
Batgirl and Supergirl team up...

28:53.880 --> 28:56.713
...to combat the forces of evil
and delight Seth Cohen.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.189
Is Supergirl wearing Doc Martens?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.916
Yes. Yes, she is, Summer.

29:02.080 --> 29:05.675
And a midriff-baring T-shirt
and a miniskirt. It's excellent.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.638
- No wonder you like comics, Super-Perv.
- That's right.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.795
Dad, we were all gonna have lunch.
Is there...?

29:11.960 --> 29:15.714
- Can I see you? Now.
- Okay.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.955
What? What'd I do?

29:20.120 --> 29:21.792
You hurt that poor girl's feelings
out there.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.790
- Who, Dad, Summer? Please...
- No. No, Anna.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.712
- I didn't say a word to Anna.
- Exactly.

29:27.880 --> 29:31.031
How do you think that makes her feel,
you flirting with another girl?

29:31.200 --> 29:33.316
Dad, I was not flirting.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.040
- Seth.
- Dad. Summer and I are friends.

29:36.200 --> 29:39.033
- That's not what it looked like.
- I'm not talking about this.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.839
Of course not. No one's talking
to me about anything lately.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.434
- Lf you want to flirt...
- Why are we talking about this?

29:44.600 --> 29:47.114
Because I'm your father
and I'm responsible for you.

29:47.280 --> 29:50.750
And if I see something's going on
with you, we are gonna talk about it.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.875
Do you think that this is about me...

29:55.040 --> 29:56.439
...or could this be about Ryan?

29:57.480 --> 30:00.074
No. It's about you.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.593
Okay.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.593
But just in case
it's a little bit about Ryan...

30:07.640 --> 30:10.029
...I think he'll come to you
when he's ready.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.877
- Hey, Mrs. Cooper.
- Hey.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.639
You all right?

30:21.160 --> 30:25.233
Hard day. Come on in.
I'll get Marissa's things for you.

30:29.040 --> 30:33.158
Well, I have to say, I'm very impressed
that you and Marissa are still friends.

30:33.680 --> 30:37.992
- Yeah, I'm impressed she forgave me.
- Maybe one day she'll forgive me too.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.832
For what?

30:41.880 --> 30:45.475
Well, I haven't exactly
been the best mom, have I?

30:46.080 --> 30:50.949
Or the best wife, or the best girlfriend,
for that matter.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.433
You and Mr. Nichol?

30:53.600 --> 30:55.750
Yeah. It's over.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.435
Which means that...

30:58.680 --> 31:00.796
...in the past six months...

31:00.960 --> 31:04.191
...I've lost my husband, my daughter...

31:04.360 --> 31:06.715
...my boyfriend and my job.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.198
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be telling you all this.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.918
No, no, it's okay.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.719
The past few months have been rough
on everybody.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.029
Yeah.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.031
Yeah, they have.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.311
Thank you for listening.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.710
I haven't had anyone to talk to in so long.

31:25.880 --> 31:30.670
Well, you can talk to me.
I don't know what good it'll do, but...

31:32.800 --> 31:33.949
Hey.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.718
You should go.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.030
Marissa's waiting.

32:03.160 --> 32:06.436
Hi, I'm Marissa Cooper. I'm staying
in the penthouse with Oliver Trask.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.875
I was wondering if someone
dropped off a bag for me.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.917
Sorry. One moment.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.913
Thank you for calling. This is Natalie.
Can you hold, please?

32:15.120 --> 32:17.270
- Let me check for you, Miss Cooper.
- Natalie?

32:17.440 --> 32:20.512
- Do you know Oliver Trask?
- Yeah, since he was just a little guy.

32:20.680 --> 32:24.036
I used to babysit him.
You don't want to know how old I am.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.359
Your last name isn't Bishop, is it?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.274
Yes, why do you ask?

32:37.480 --> 32:38.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.598
I was just calling your cell.

32:40.760 --> 32:43.354
Where'd you go? I got out
of the shower, and you were gone.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.432
I just went downstairs to see
if they had my bag, but they didn't.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.114
You didn't have to do that.
They'll bring it up.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.120
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.508
It's just...

32:56.560 --> 32:59.028
It's just, the weirdest thing happened.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.476
You know the concierge at the
front desk? Her name's Natalie.

33:02.760 --> 33:05.832
Natalie Bishop.
The same as your ex-girlfriend, right?

33:06.000 --> 33:09.515
- It's just, how weird is that?
- I know what you're thinking, but...

33:09.680 --> 33:13.468
- There is no ex-girlfriend, is there?
- Marissa, I can explain.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.278
- I have to go.
- No, no. Please.

33:15.440 --> 33:19.592
Okay. I'm so sorry. I always do this.
Why do I always do this?

33:19.760 --> 33:21.955
- Oliver, stop it.
- Damn it!

33:22.120 --> 33:23.872
- Oliver, stop.
- Okay.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.679
All right? It's okay.
I'm not going anywhere.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.150
So why don't you just go get changed,
and then we can go?

33:30.320 --> 33:33.198
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.319
- Okay.
- Yeah.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.154
Come on. Pick up.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.278
- Hello?
- Ryan, it's me.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.237
- What's going on? Where are you?
- At the hotel. I can't talk right now.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.597
It's Oliver, he's... You were right.
And now he won't let me leave.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.112
Hang up!

34:10.679 --> 34:12.909
Hang up the phone. Please?

34:14.080 --> 34:15.228
Give me the phone.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.197
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- What's going on?

34:17.360 --> 34:19.476
Please, give me the phone.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.629
Bye, Ryan.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.549
It's too bad that Summer couldn't stay.
We have so much food.

34:32.719 --> 34:35.837
- Never fear, Mom. Anna's here.
- You noticed.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.036
- Hey, Seth, why don't you go get Ryan.
- Okay.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.918
- Hey, will you come with me?
- Yeah.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.629
Sure, maybe then we can be alone
for, like, 10 seconds.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.030
Hey. I'm sorry about the Summer thing.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.634
You know how excited I get
turning people on to comics.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.234
I know how excited you get
turning Summer on, yeah.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.674
Okay. That's not fair.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.559
- I thought we were all friends.
- No. She's your friend.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.792
I am your girlfriend. There's a difference.
Or there should be.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.311
Hey! Food's here.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.869
- Where you going?
- I think Marissa's in trouble.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.792
- Give me the keys.
- I have to go, okay?

35:09.960 --> 35:11.188
Give me the keys!

35:11.360 --> 35:15.035
- You said I could come to you for help.
- Give me the keys!

35:17.560 --> 35:19.278
I'll drive.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.516
I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.750
I heard you on the phone,
and I didn't know what to do.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.354
That's okay. So why don't you
just put the gun down.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.471
- We can talk about it.
- No, you'll leave.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.313
- Oliver. I have to go some time.
- What? To him?

35:33.480 --> 35:34.674
To him, right?

35:34.840 --> 35:36.592
- What about me?
- You and I are friends.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.149
- We will always be friends.
- Friends?!

35:39.320 --> 35:41.515
Friends, Marissa?! I'm in love with you!

35:41.680 --> 35:44.558
How could you not know that?
I've always been.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.433
You're the one who gets me.
The only one who gets me.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.229
You're the only thing
in my life that I love.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.755
Then why would you want to hurt me?

35:55.920 --> 35:58.593
I don't. I never would.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.431
This isn't for you. It's for me.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.634
Because if you leave,
I'll have nothing else to live for.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.797
So you have to promise me
you will not leave.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.710
There's no answer.
They're not picking up.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.633
Excuse me. My name's Sandy Cohen.
We got an emergency call...

36:24.800 --> 36:27.633
...from the penthouse 20 minutes ago,
and now no one's answering.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.711
Is there any chance you could let us in?

36:29.880 --> 36:32.519
I'm sorry. Without permission,
we're really not able to.

36:32.680 --> 36:36.434
Please, we have a friend up there
in trouble. If you could just... Wait.

36:36.600 --> 36:37.874
Wait. You're Natalie?

36:39.800 --> 36:41.199
Natalie Bishop?

36:42.320 --> 36:44.151
Are you a friend of Oliver's?

36:49.960 --> 36:52.190
Oliver, you there? It's Natalie.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.794
- Oliver, I'm coming in.
- No, no. That's okay.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.315
I'm fine. I just got out of the shower.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.357
Oliver, please.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.152
I guess he's fine.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.311
Well, thanks for checking.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.913
We'll go.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.469
No, no. Marissa?

37:15.360 --> 37:16.634
Marissa!

37:18.120 --> 37:19.758
All right. Let's go.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.148
Ryan, he's got a gun!

37:21.480 --> 37:24.278
- Let's go.
- Why did you do that?

37:24.440 --> 37:25.998
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.720
Please just put the gun away
and let them in.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.871
- Sir, don't move!
- Put the gun down.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.268
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?

37:33.160 --> 37:35.071
- Let me save you the trouble.
- Come on, son.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.959
- You don't want to do that.
- Put the gun down. Now.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.392
- I'm sorry.
- Oliver, put the gun down, man.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.915
Why, man? I'm doing you a favor.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.514
Why would you want to do that?
You hate me.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.153
That's right, you do this,
you won't hurt me.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.880
You'll hurt Marissa,
the one person that cares about you.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.110
And I know you don't want to do that.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.992
Oliver, put the gun down, man.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.516
You don't know anything about me, man.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.394
I know what it's like
to be abandoned by your parents...

38:07.720 --> 38:09.836
...your friends...

38:10.280 --> 38:12.919
...to have no one in your life
who believes in you.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.314
But you put the gun down,
you get a second chance.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.198
That's it. Just put it down.

38:33.480 --> 38:36.995
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.834
Marissa's okay. Her mom's got her.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.834
And the police are taking Oliver
to the hospital.

39:00.440 --> 39:03.512
I'm gonna clean up the pool house
before they get here.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.157
I should give Summer a call.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.311
What? Why?

39:10.480 --> 39:13.552
- To let her know Marissa's okay.
- She doesn't know Marissa's not okay.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.188
- Don't you think she'd want to know?
- You know what?

39:16.800 --> 39:18.631
- Call her. I'm leaving.
- Anna, wait.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.756
Just wait.
This huge thing just happened.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.275
And the first thing you do
is decide to call Summer?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.751
Come on, Seth.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.434
Look...

39:32.280 --> 39:34.316
...I think you're a great guy.

39:35.400 --> 39:39.393
But I'm not gonna stand here and pretend
like I'm your girlfriend when I'm not.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.317
At least not anymore.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.792
I'll see you in school.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.519
Hi.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.113
I was wondering where my copy
of <i>Kavalier and Klay</i> went.

40:05.280 --> 40:08.477
You gave it to me. You said I couldn't
be your friend until I read it.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.039
And have you?

40:10.200 --> 40:12.031
I've been a little distracted.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.112
Well, it's a good story, Ryan.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.317
It's the tale of two young men
who couldn't be more different...

40:17.800 --> 40:20.155
...but they learn to overcome
their differences.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.595
They team up and essentially...

40:22.760 --> 40:25.797
...become brothers,
not unlike you and me.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.038
Except that I blew it.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.080
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.953
Ever since the day you got here,
you have totally had my back.

40:38.120 --> 40:43.752
And I promise you, from now on,
I will never fail you again.

40:43.920 --> 40:45.478
I'm so sorry.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.318
Do you want to tell me
about your night?

40:56.480 --> 41:00.758
Or, since I already heard about it,
could we skip to my breakup with Anna?

41:00.920 --> 41:02.399
Really? Anna broke up with you?

41:02.560 --> 41:04.630
Why would you just assume
Anna broke up with me?

41:04.920 --> 41:07.309
- Seth, come on.
- What does that mean?

41:07.480 --> 41:08.993
What, she didn't break up with you?

41:09.160 --> 41:11.355
She did. But you're supposed
to have my back here.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.432
So the three of us...

41:15.305 --> 41:21.862
