00:02.252 --> 00:03.878
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.961 --> 00:05.922
Remember that conversation
we weren't gonna have?

00:08.384 --> 00:09.759
This is it.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.345
Next one's coming faster.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.764
I don't do business with people I don't know.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.349
You are a smart man.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.850
So, allow this

00:19.478 --> 00:20.561
to be an introduction.

00:20.646 --> 00:22.355
This here's the carrot.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.439
What's the stick?

00:23.524 --> 00:26.609
There is one little man
that you need to crack down on right now,

00:26.694 --> 00:27.777
Boyd Crowder.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.779
Now, I'm gonna go out on a limb here

00:29.863 --> 00:33.491
and presume that there's someone
behind the man with the badge.

00:33.575 --> 00:37.286
And I'm guessing
that man is named Robert Quarles.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.331
Just that you ain't got the means
or the muscle

00:40.416 --> 00:42.750
to beat Quarles' newfound alliance.

00:42.835 --> 00:46.713
And then you go right on back to Mr. Quarles
with your tail 'tween your legs,

00:46.797 --> 00:51.467
and you tell him this whole thing
was your idea to get back at the Crowders.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.302
- That it?
- Not quite.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.347
See, I'm gonna want to know
what Mr. Quarles is up to.

00:56.432 --> 00:59.851
- Gary, this is my business associate, Mike.
- Hey.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.478
Now, wait a minute. Do I know you?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.438
Yes, Gary, you do.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.525
Now, if your agents are following
Sammy Tonin on his travels here,

01:07.609 --> 01:10.194
then you're either building a case
against him, or you're trying to protect him.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.697
If you got a case, Agent,
why don't you let us help you with it?

01:12.781 --> 01:17.577
All I need from you, Chief,
and your deputy here is to back off.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.996
Next time you're someplace
where our federal friends are listening,

01:20.080 --> 01:21.247
mention that Givens came to see you,

01:21.331 --> 01:23.458
and that you believe he's in bed with a guy
from Harlan,

01:23.542 --> 01:25.585
a guy named Boyd Crowder. Say it!

01:25.669 --> 01:26.669
Boyd Crowder.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.176
It's a call.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.929
Yeah? Hey, listen, I found the source
of that heat down here in Lexington.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.681
Actually, he found me.

01:38.766 --> 01:39.849
He's a silver star.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.644
<i>- Deputy Givens?
- Yeah, turns out he's dirty,</i>

01:44.354 --> 01:47.482
but he's looking to help out
for some consideration.

01:47.566 --> 01:50.943
I don't know. Could be bullshit.
He said I should check it out.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.405
He's already in the pocket of some gun thug
that he used to dig coal with down in Harlan.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.241
- That Crowder kid?
- Yeah. Yes.

01:58.494 --> 02:01.537
<i>Hold on a sec. Waiter!
Please, I ordered medium-rare.</i>

02:01.622 --> 02:02.914
<i>This is rare-rare. Still got a pulse.</i>

02:02.998 --> 02:05.374
Sir? You're gonna want to hear this.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.470
Tanner. I was wondering
what happened to you.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.015
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.017
I would love to. Sounds great.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.769
Have a good night.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.564
Tanner Dodd.

03:09.648 --> 03:13.359
- Did he say what happened?
- He wants to meet up to explain.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.237
Brave man.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.427
What are you gonna do to me?

04:22.846 --> 04:26.015
I need you to deliver a message
to Raylan Givens.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.937
You're taking me home?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.272
In a way, Gary.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.693
And what's the message
you want me to give to Raylan?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.199
Let's go.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.636
Mr. Quarles!

05:50.684 --> 05:52.143
Yeah?

05:57.274 --> 05:59.650
Pardon my intrusion.

05:59.735 --> 06:04.447
Sir, my name is Ellstin Limehouse
from Nobles Holler, down in Harlan County.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.451
What brings you to Lexington,
Mr. Limehouse?

06:08.535 --> 06:12.705
I just wanted to let you know
Boyd Crowder is backing a man for sheriff.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.458
- And I give a shit because...
- Man named Shelby.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.878
Used to be with the Harlan Police.
Good man from what I hear.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.505
You came all this way to tell me that?

06:21.590 --> 06:23.966
I likes to back the winning side.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.184
Hey, that was great music last night, Kent.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.562
- Glad you liked it, Raylan.
- Just what I needed.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.315
Hey, listen,
I was just about to knock on your door.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.442
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.070
- I saw someone fooling around by your car.
- You did?

06:44.154 --> 06:47.615
As I was driving up, looked like
someone was messing with your trunk.

06:47.699 --> 06:52.078
I honked my horn, and they took off.
Didn't get a look at them.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.579
- Thank you.
- You bet.

06:53.663 --> 06:57.666
You're saying this neighborhood ain't
as safe as I thought it was?

06:57.751 --> 07:00.336
Why I don't mind having
a US Marshal living upstairs.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.172
Take it easy.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.537
Givens.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.832
Yeah, who's this?

07:48.885 --> 07:52.638
- Deputy Givens.
- Detective Garrity. Thanks for coming out.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.973
Why am I here?

07:54.057 --> 07:55.933
Well, the property is owned
by your ex-wife and her husband.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.768
We couldn't track either one of them down.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.603
- They're estranged.
- Excuse me?

07:59.688 --> 08:02.523
- Estranged husband.
- Estranged husband.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.072
Jesus. I thought you said
you couldn't track him down.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.159
Wait, you're saying this is
your ex-wife's husband?

08:13.243 --> 08:14.618
- What happened?
- I don't know.

08:14.703 --> 08:19.290
I'm just trying to put the pieces together.
I was hoping you could help me.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.836
Wait. Where the hell are you going?

08:23.920 --> 08:27.923
First thing you guys do is look at photos.
Anyone you can connect to this place, right?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.842
Guy was in real estate.
You give me a few minutes,

08:29.926 --> 08:31.844
I'll show you a picture of him
on a park bench.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.889
You got a lot of experience
in homicide investigations, do you?

08:34.972 --> 08:36.932
Mostly, I just hunt fugitives.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.559
Well, you've testified in enough of them.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.188
As a witness, as an intended victim.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.608
In fact, didn't you and Mr. Hawkins
once give testimony in the same case?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.193
Two men shot dead

08:47.277 --> 08:51.155
in an office owned by Wynn Duffy
of Frankfort, Kentucky and points south.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.781
That's right.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.077
In your experience, who's the most
likely perpetrator in a homicide case?

08:57.162 --> 09:01.582
Mine, it's the exes, ex-boyfriends, ex-wives.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.793
I gotta go to work.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.796
Well, thanks for your help.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.468
At least now I know you didn't kill him
the night he disappeared.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.594
You don't know that.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.888
I could have killed him
and put him in my icebox for a few weeks

09:15.972 --> 09:18.599
- just to throw off the timeline.
- Like that dude in New Jersey.

09:18.683 --> 09:22.353
- What dude in New Jersey?
- Richard "The Iceman" Kuklinski.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.189
How'd it work out for him?

09:25.273 --> 09:28.192
Actually, I already knew
you didn't kill Gary that night.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.403
He's been living in Tulsa for months
under an assumed name.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.823
- How'd you know that?
- I'm good at my job.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.410
If you already knew that,
why you been messing with me?

09:38.495 --> 09:39.828
It was fun.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.083
- I'm disappointed in you, David.
- Not as much as I am in myself.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.585
- You have to redo the indictment.
- The second I leave the courtroom.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.837
You know how
you're gonna redo the indictment?

09:48.922 --> 09:51.674
Off the top of my head, I'm thinking
I'm gonna do whatever you tell me to do.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.592
Good. You're smarter
than I give you credit for.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.095
- High praise, Your Honor.
- Add "knowingly."

09:56.179 --> 09:59.265
The accused knowingly trapped
and sold red-tail hawks.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.893
You can't just say trapped the damn things
and sold them. That's not in dispute.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.436
Add "knowingly."

10:04.521 --> 10:06.981
- Consider it done.
- I don't consider it done till it's done.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.566
Go on. Get. Next!

10:09.901 --> 10:11.819
Speedo-wearing lunatic.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.448
- David Vasquez?
- Yes.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.118
- FBI SAC Jeremy Barkley.
- Okay.

10:19.202 --> 10:22.413
I understand you've been having some
run-ins with Raylan Givens not so long ago,

10:22.497 --> 10:24.456
been keeping tabs on him.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.833
I wouldn't say I was keeping tabs on him.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.295
Would it be possible
for me to have a look at your file?

10:29.379 --> 10:30.379
Yeah.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.967
Crowder's cripple almost crippled me.
I just wanted to hit back, so I did.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.345
I know I should have cleared it with you first,
but I know you were fighting with Crowder,

10:38.430 --> 10:39.471
so I thought you'd be okay with it.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.682
What's the most important thing
you said right there?

10:41.766 --> 10:44.143
- Should have cleared it with you.
- When Givens got the Oxy trailer,

10:44.227 --> 10:45.936
did he see you?

10:46.021 --> 10:48.397
Look, I'm gonna find out eventually.
He comes to me with a picture.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.773
- Ask if I know this guy.
- Yeah, he saw me.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.525
Threw me out of the trailer
at 30 miles an hour.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.986
- That's not good.
- I know. It hurt like a son of a bitch.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.322
No, shit stain, it's not good
because he saw you,

10:56.406 --> 10:58.157
which is why you chose
this public place to meet,

10:58.241 --> 11:00.159
so I don't chop your balls off right now.

11:00.243 --> 11:04.496
Look, sir, Mr. Quarles, you need someone
who knows his way around Harlan.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.999
- I got the sheriff.
- Well, someone who ain't the law.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.668
So what I need is a federal fugitive
who assaulted a US Marshal.

11:09.753 --> 11:10.836
I don't think so.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.255
Mr. Quarles, sir,
I will do anything to make it right.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.674
You walk into a crowded room,
shoot someone in the face, I ask you?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.009
- Yes, sir.
- Last chance.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.677
- I got it.
- Then get your ass in the car

11:18.762 --> 11:21.597
and get back to Harlan as fast as you can.

11:22.974 --> 11:26.310
- Yep?
- Come in. Have a seat.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.071
How you doing, Raylan?

11:38.073 --> 11:41.325
What, about Gary?
I didn't know him that well.

11:41.618 --> 11:45.621
No, I mean in general.
You know, after Winona.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.250
I've been drinking a little more
than usual if I have to be honest.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.962
But you live right above a bar,
so all you have to do is toddle upstairs.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.508
- Art, what do you want to know?
- I figure the less I know, the better.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.219
How you stayed in charge this long,
I imagine.

12:00.303 --> 12:04.556
But I do need to know that I'm not gonna
get blindsided by some horseshit detail

12:04.641 --> 12:06.725
that these local peckerwoods dredge up,

12:06.810 --> 12:10.270
and then I have to watch them cuff you
right here in my Marshals Office.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.399
- So what do you need to know?
- Exactly.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.361
It's gonna rain tomorrow.
Might want to bring an umbrella.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.280
That's good information. Thank you.

12:20.865 --> 12:24.993
So, I don't need to know who else might
want to kill Gary Hawkins other than you.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.205
- I can make a couple guesses.
- The only reason I say "other than you"

12:28.289 --> 12:32.418
is because homicide's gonna go after
the deer that's already in their crosshairs,

12:32.502 --> 12:34.420
and when it comes to Gary,
you're an easy target.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.046
You know that, and I know that.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.007
They already know about the two hit men
that went after you and Winona,

12:39.092 --> 12:41.135
and then right after that,
Gary disappeared into the ether.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.804
If he stayed disappeared,
I imagine he'd be alive today.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.349
Well, if they find another connection
besides what they already know,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.852
- they are gonna burn you down.
- I know that.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.690
- Have you told Winona yet?
- No.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.859
Here's your big chance.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.112
I was afraid something
might have happened to you.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.364
I told them to tell you that Raylan was fine.

13:02.449 --> 13:06.869
Well, that's what they would say
even if he wasn't fine. What's going on?

13:07.829 --> 13:10.080
Leaving us alone. This can't be good.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.498
What's up?

13:12.834 --> 13:14.209
Gary's dead.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.300
- What?
- Police found him on your lawn this morning.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.759
He was shot.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.305
On my lawn?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.026
What did he do?

13:40.778 --> 13:43.989
- I don't...
- I mean, I know what the...

13:44.073 --> 13:47.993
The stuff that he was involved in,
the people that he was all tangled up with,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.704
and, you know, the money issues.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.666
He was shot to death?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.585
On my front lawn?

13:59.923 --> 14:03.217
I guess I just... I want to know what he did
to deserve that. Do you know?

14:03.301 --> 14:05.010
Local PD's looking into it.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.264
God damn it, Gary.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.324
LPD's lab got a good print off the casing.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.159
They ran it through the federal
and the state databases,

14:29.244 --> 14:30.702
and they got a match.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.162
Wynn Duffy?

14:33.248 --> 14:34.498
Quarles?

14:35.917 --> 14:36.959
You.

14:44.050 --> 14:47.094
You're in the motor coach
with Robert Quarles and Wynn Duffy.

14:47.178 --> 14:50.430
There's a bodyguard out front,
but that still doesn't explain to me

14:50.515 --> 14:53.433
how you got your fingerprints
on a bullet casing.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.228
- I threw a bullet at him.
- You threw a bullet at him.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.438
- Yeah.
- Wait, you threw a bullet at him?

14:58.523 --> 15:01.108
No, I, like, dropped it.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.151
- On the floor?
- On Duffy.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.654
- So, Duffy was on the floor.
- Yes.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.239
You failed to mention that, Deputy.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.826
- Well, I'm mentioning it now.
- How'd he get on the floor, I wonder?

15:10.910 --> 15:14.746
Look, you wanted to know how my prints
got on the casing. Now you know. Okay?

15:14.831 --> 15:16.498
Wait, why did you throw a bullet at him?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.001
- I was trying to make a point.
- Which was?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.712
Get the hell out of Kentucky
and don't come back.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.172
How was throwing a bullet at him
gonna accomplish that?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.967
Told him the next one
might be coming a little faster.

15:28.553 --> 15:32.848
Deputy, that might just be
the coolest thing I've ever laid ears on.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.685
Did you come up with that all on your own?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.645
Heard it on <i>The Johnny Carson Show</i> once.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.773
He was telling some old gangster story.
I always thought it was kind of cool.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.650
Well, that just gets better and better.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.902
It would be a lot better and a lot cooler
if it had actually worked.

15:45.987 --> 15:49.072
But still, it's a shame we have to lock you up.

15:50.491 --> 15:54.911
I'm gonna run down this Quarles and Duffy
and see if this damn story makes any sense.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.955
Okay, and I will get back to work.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.459
Not so fast, Deputy. We need to take
a look at your service weapon for ballistics.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.501
Are you serious?

16:01.586 --> 16:04.880
Well, his ballistics are all on file
from previous...

16:05.673 --> 16:07.924
- They're on file.
- We just need to check the serial numbers

16:08.009 --> 16:09.426
and make sure
you're using the same weapon.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.261
This is ridiculous.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.974
Wait, you're not gonna throw that one at me,
are you?

16:17.602 --> 16:18.602
The bullet.

16:23.733 --> 16:27.486
Hello? Anybody there? Police.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.625
Anybody here?

16:52.261 --> 16:54.429
Somebody just pulled up
in front of the house.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.140
- Who?
- I don't know. Looks like a cop.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.852
- Did you paint the room?
- Not yet.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.313
Go.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.801
Hey, there. Can I help you?

17:35.471 --> 17:38.098
Detective Dempsey, Lexington Police.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.017
- You are?
- In my house.

17:41.102 --> 17:45.147
Sorry. I knocked. Nobody answered.
Tried the door. It just opened.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.235
Well, as you can see,
there wasn't much to secure in here, so...

17:50.319 --> 17:52.237
- Who are you?
- I'm Robert Quarles.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.906
- This is Wynn Duffy.
- Hello.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.952
- Both of you. Good. Anybody else here?
- Just us.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.288
You don't mind if I look around then.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.081
Feel free.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.333
That door sticks.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.461
- Sticks.
- Yeah.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.129
Detective? Detective?

18:10.506 --> 18:13.383
May I ask what brings you here?

18:13.468 --> 18:15.802
Either of you know Gary Hawkins?

18:52.507 --> 18:54.883
He says he threw a bullet at you.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.803
- Threw a what?
- A bullet.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.806
A bullet. Well, that is interesting.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.309
Says you conspired
with Gary Hawkins and two hit men

19:04.393 --> 19:07.103
to kill Deputy Givens
and Hawkins' wife, Winona.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.689
No. That never happened.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.943
Deputy Givens seems
to see a lot of conspiracies.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.027
All untrue.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.905
I know Gary said something like that,

19:16.989 --> 19:21.660
but I distinctly told Deputy Givens
I did nothing of the sort.

19:22.578 --> 19:26.873
I remember Givens telling Gary to run
and to not stop running.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.042
Next thing I heard about Gary Hawkins
was when I walked in here,

19:29.126 --> 19:30.836
and your colleague told me he was dead.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.088
He admits to beating Duffy.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.382
Well, I'm glad he's telling the truth
about that.

19:35.466 --> 19:36.883
He beat the shit out of him.

19:37.134 --> 19:41.304
He started beating me
because he was looking for Gary,

19:41.389 --> 19:43.348
and I didn't know where he was.

19:43.432 --> 19:49.521
And I guess he didn't like my answer,
because that's when he started hitting me.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.232
In the face.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.068
- Does he have a drinking problem?
- What?

19:55.987 --> 19:58.822
Detective? Just between you and me,

19:59.949 --> 20:02.492
Raylan Givens is a very angry man.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.664
Sheriff Napier.
What brings you to a closed-down bar?

20:07.748 --> 20:12.252
Crowder, if my men weren't with me, you'd
be on the floor with a bullet in your head.

20:12.336 --> 20:15.088
Well, I thought this election
could be contested without intimidation.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.339
I guess I was wrong.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.258
You don't see his hands
in the next two seconds, shoot him.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.384
Whoa, now. Hold on.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.761
- Boyd Crowder, you are under arrest.
- For what?

20:21.846 --> 20:25.348
For putting 50 pounds of goddamn dynamite
under my car.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.725
I did what now?

20:26.809 --> 20:28.727
You have the right to remain silent.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.062
Sing along, Crowder.
I know you know these words by now.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.981
- ...against you in a court of law.
- Yeah.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.919
Ms. Hawkins, could we talk to you
for a moment?

20:54.003 --> 20:56.338
Would you like a lawyer present?

20:56.422 --> 20:58.673
- Do I need a lawyer present?
- She doesn't need one.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.383
You don't need one.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.392
Timeline for yesterday.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.696
Did Deputy Givens ever mention wanting
to do Gary harm?

21:21.781 --> 21:22.781
No.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.325
Do you think he might have thought about it?

21:26.577 --> 21:29.955
No. Raylan didn't like Gary,
but he didn't have any reason to kill him.

21:30.039 --> 21:33.083
Even after Gary supposedly hired
a hit man to kill both of you?

21:34.418 --> 21:35.460
I'm sorry?

21:35.544 --> 21:38.046
So, between 7:00 and 8:30,
you're eating supper alone,

21:38.130 --> 21:40.131
black coffee, a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

21:40.216 --> 21:44.678
You want to go ahead and put your ear
up to that glass, you be my guest.

21:44.762 --> 21:45.929
Raylan.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.307
- Tim, give us a second, will you?
- Well, no.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.268
I don't think I should be going anywhere
until we figure out what your timeline is.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.146
- Is it true?
- You're gonna have to be more specific.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.482
Those guys who tried to kill us.
Gary was involved with that?

21:57.566 --> 22:00.694
Tell you what. I think I need
to get myself a cup of coffee.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.404
You all want one?

22:05.241 --> 22:06.449
Yeah.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.617
- You're sure?
- Yes.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.829
Why didn't you tell me?
I mean, I looked at him...

22:10.913 --> 22:15.625
I looked at him straight in the eye that day,
and he knew I was gonna be dead later.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.377
And I had no idea.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.506
What does that say about me?

22:21.590 --> 22:26.177
Raylan, Winona, they would like to search
both your places and your vehicles.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.221
Would you like for me to ask them
to get a warrant?

22:28.305 --> 22:30.598
No. Knock yourself out.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.767
Winona?

22:33.602 --> 22:35.437
Yeah. No, that's fine.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.110
- What does that say about me?
- Nothing.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.948
- It doesn't say...
- Then why didn't you tell me, Raylan?

22:47.033 --> 22:50.577
I thought if you knew, it would kill you.

22:50.661 --> 22:51.703
Shit.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.496
- What?
- My car.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.707
What about your car?

22:55.791 --> 22:58.877
The bartender said there was someone
outside my car this morning, and I looked.

22:58.961 --> 23:03.089
There was nothing missing, but I didn't
think to see if something was put inside.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.507
Like what?

23:05.509 --> 23:09.012
Winona, do you know what's going on here?
I'm being framed of a murder I didn't commit.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.431
As opposed to a murder you did commit.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.350
- Are you being funny?
- No. I'm not trying to be funny. I'm just...

23:14.435 --> 23:16.936
If you didn't do anything wrong,
you don't have anything to worry about.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.314
That's what you always told me.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.443
Winona.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.864
Winona, would you wait?
I need you to listen to me.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.700
No. No, Raylan. I've heard enough today,
don't you think?

23:30.785 --> 23:32.744
Raylan, it's about time.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.705
There you go. Just the man we're looking for.

23:35.790 --> 23:36.748
- Winona.
- Hey, hey.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.501
You get on that elevator,
and I will arrest you.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.753
Arrest him for what?
This is not a federal case.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.922
We're not here about the Hawkins murder.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.841
We're here about Raylan Givens
being a dirty cop.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.767
You have a problem with my men searching
your computer, your desk?

23:55.851 --> 23:59.104
I'm sure it might take Mr. Vasquez all of,
what, five minutes to get a warrant.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.355
Whatever moves this along.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.940
Deputy Givens, we're not done.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.276
- Who are you?
- Detective Garrity, Lexington PD.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.195
And I'm FBI. Wait your turn.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.532
Tim, would you show the detective
to the cafeteria?

24:14.620 --> 24:18.832
Now, if you're coming after my deputy
because he dared disobey your godlike order

24:18.916 --> 24:20.708
that he stay away from your Detroit thug...

24:20.793 --> 24:23.002
No, no, no, I'm coming after your deputy

24:23.087 --> 24:28.049
because I've read the file AUSA Vasquez
compiled on Deputy Givens,

24:28.134 --> 24:33.388
and I discovered a broad, pervasive pattern
strongly suggestive of corruption.

24:33.472 --> 24:37.517
Raylan may be a lot of things,
but I've never gotten even a whiff of dirty.

24:37.601 --> 24:41.104
Well, maybe that says something
about you, Chief.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.606
Did you honestly just say that?

24:43.691 --> 24:48.945
Chief, you can either assist or resist
in this inquiry,

24:49.029 --> 24:52.740
but if you resist, we may have
to out you under a microscope.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.909
So you're threatening me now?

24:54.994 --> 24:59.831
I'm saying we just may have to give more
credence to the claims of one Walter Vondas.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.667
He's the one who killed your WitSec marshal.

25:02.751 --> 25:08.256
He said that you beat the shit out of him,
threatened to kill him to get information.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.343
Hey. Excuse me.
Am I not the one you're after?

25:12.428 --> 25:15.221
If so, would you mind if we just get to it?

25:15.306 --> 25:18.266
It is my belief that ever since...

25:19.268 --> 25:22.353
Well, ever since you came to this office here
in your home state of Kentucky

25:22.438 --> 25:25.940
that you have been working with
and perhaps even paid by

25:26.025 --> 25:28.568
the convicted criminal Boyd Crowder.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.996
What are we waiting for?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.707
You're running your boy Shelby's
campaign to unseat me,

25:42.791 --> 25:45.168
and you don't know what we're waiting for?

25:45.252 --> 25:47.295
Good luck with that.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.713
They're here.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.887
You have to wait for the camera, you moron.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.599
If you're gonna do a perp walk,
you need the goddamn camera.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.358
All ready?

26:08.442 --> 26:09.734
Showtime.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.412
You rolling? I don't see no red light.
There we go.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.248
Today, I have arrested Boyd Crowder

26:23.332 --> 26:26.501
in association with a bombing attempt
on my life this morning.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.753
Crowder has a long history of run-ins
with the law

26:28.837 --> 26:31.130
and is known to have experience
with explosives

26:31.215 --> 26:34.092
and has thrown his questionable muscle
behind my opponent in this election.

26:34.343 --> 26:37.595
At that point, Deputy Givens "deputized"
Boyd Crowder

26:37.680 --> 26:41.766
and then joined him
in a shootout that left four men dead.

26:42.476 --> 26:45.603
Not so long ago, a war blew up
in Harlan between Boyd Crowder's gang

26:45.688 --> 26:49.482
which now includes Givens' father, Arlo,
a lifetime criminal.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.566
Is that a fair description?

26:50.651 --> 26:53.695
I'd add "petty" to be more accurate.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.656
Between Boyd Crowder's gang
and the Bennett clan,

26:56.740 --> 27:01.577
and all the Bennetts ended up,
well, in jail or dead.

27:02.913 --> 27:06.666
When you gonna get to the time
I shot Boyd in the chest?

27:06.750 --> 27:09.377
- Well, you knew that already, right?
- Well, I do now.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.586
Oh, boy.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.171
- Can I go?
- No.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.840
- Stop me.
- Raylan.

27:13.924 --> 27:17.051
- Look, either you stop him, or I will.
- Raylan!

27:18.345 --> 27:20.555
- God damn it.
- You know,

27:20.639 --> 27:22.974
Art, it's bullshit, and you know it.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.143
- Is it?
- Is that a real question?

27:25.227 --> 27:26.436
It had a question mark.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.479
Here's my answer. Kiss my ass.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.983
Fantastic, then. Let's get back in there
and settle this! They got nothing!

27:32.067 --> 27:33.735
What the hell's wrong with you?

27:33.819 --> 27:37.363
Art, any chance you can spare Raylan?
LPD wanted a word.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.414
You go talk to LPD. I'll take care of them.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.834
Hey! Hey! Where the hell's he going?

27:49.918 --> 27:53.296
- LPD wanted to talk to him.
- I told you they could wait.

27:53.380 --> 27:57.133
I figured it was their turn. Gives me
a chance to ask you a question, though.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.011
Just out of curiosity,

28:00.095 --> 28:04.891
what gave you the idea to look into Raylan
and Boyd Crowder in the first place?

28:06.602 --> 28:08.603
Yeah, you never told me that.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.906
- What are you doing?
- I got to go.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.532
- You got to go.
- It's important.

28:21.617 --> 28:24.035
Where do you got to go?
And before you answer,

28:24.119 --> 28:28.122
kind of a "What the hell? It's worth a shot."
Why don't you try telling me the truth?

28:29.625 --> 28:32.251
I think Quarles put a murder weapon
in my car.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.713
I'm gonna take you downstairs.

28:51.105 --> 28:52.980
I took you downstairs.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.279
- Winona?
- I found the gun.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.114
<i>Where?</i>

29:43.198 --> 29:45.199
It's at my house. Well, at my old house.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.744
- What are you doing at the house?
- Looking for the gun.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.789
You touch it?

29:51.874 --> 29:53.249
What am I, an asshole?

29:53.333 --> 29:55.710
<i>- Can you get it out of there?</i>
- I can try.

29:58.172 --> 29:59.505
All right.

30:01.383 --> 30:02.800
God damn it.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.017
Let's get over to the Hawkins house now.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.305
I'll let you in.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.321
I mean, she's older
for a Victoria's Secret girl,

31:05.405 --> 31:07.281
but that's how you know
she knows what she's doing.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.491
Hey!

31:09.785 --> 31:11.160
- Hey!
- Hey.

31:11.245 --> 31:12.537
Where is he?

31:12.621 --> 31:14.789
- Where's who?
- Don't play dumb with me, Deputy.

31:15.249 --> 31:18.834
I'm not playing. I'm an idiot.
You can ask anybody.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.045
Can I help you?

31:21.129 --> 31:24.632
Yeah. Your deputy was supposed
to take Givens downstairs,

31:24.716 --> 31:25.716
bring him right back up.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.386
I just checked with the detective.
He never saw him.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.304
Well, I took him down.

31:31.932 --> 31:35.226
Well, it's a big building, you know.
He'll turn up.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.396
Could be taking a shit.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.002
Thank you.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.046
You gonna throw it off a bridge?

32:05.716 --> 32:07.341
I don't know.

32:09.553 --> 32:10.886
Where you headed?

32:10.971 --> 32:13.806
This time, seriously, don't come find me.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.298
What the hell are you doing here?

32:47.382 --> 32:49.050
I'm here for the money you owe me.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.637
We both work for the same guy.
Go get it from him.

32:52.721 --> 32:56.724
Mr. Quarles specifically said
for me to get the money from you

32:56.808 --> 32:58.601
out of your own pocket,

32:58.685 --> 33:01.187
it being an election expense and all.

33:01.271 --> 33:02.938
The hell I will.

33:04.608 --> 33:08.152
Even if I did owe you,
I sure as hell wouldn't pay you.

33:08.236 --> 33:12.990
You were supposed to wait until I get back
in the house before you set that thing off.

33:13.075 --> 33:15.701
Damn near blew out my ears.
Couldn't hear right all day.

33:15.786 --> 33:18.162
Tell you what. Get me what you owe me,

33:18.246 --> 33:22.249
or next time, I won't even wait
for you to get out of the car.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.722
Where the hell did you go?

33:36.807 --> 33:38.808
Your FBI boyfriend about shit a brick.

33:38.892 --> 33:42.186
- Needed some air. Anything on ballistics?
- No match.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.480
- Well, there you go.
- There you go nothing.

33:44.564 --> 33:45.690
You could have used another gun.

33:45.774 --> 33:48.609
- Did you find another gun?
- You'd be too savvy to keep it around.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.027
Probably at the bottom of a river by now.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.696
You really think I did it?

33:51.780 --> 33:55.324
I don't know.
I do know I'm not closing the file.

33:55.409 --> 33:59.620
Well, it seems you've dodged another
in a long series of bullets.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.874
- No indictment?
- Not from my office. Not yet, anyway.

34:03.959 --> 34:06.961
- See what you add to your file.
- You know, I'd love to see that file.

34:07.045 --> 34:11.132
- Deputy, you know what's in it.
- No, I don't. That's why I asked.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.717
You know, if you wanted to re-create it
for yourself,

34:12.801 --> 34:14.217
you could sit down with pen and paper

34:14.302 --> 34:18.514
and just write down all the shit
you know you shouldn't have done.

34:21.518 --> 34:25.478
- Where the hell were you?
- That's none of your business.

34:25.563 --> 34:29.734
Special Agent in Charge Barkley has
determined that the source of his tip

34:29.818 --> 34:33.571
regarding you and Boyd Crowder is
something he'd rather not divulge.

34:33.655 --> 34:37.074
And AUSA Vasquez said that in order for him
to pursue an indictment,

34:37.159 --> 34:39.243
he would need to do so.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.579
Doesn't mean you're not dirty.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.672
Thanks.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.549
Raylan, you remember that time I told you

34:53.632 --> 34:57.136
I didn't think you were gonna make it
to retirement?

34:57.220 --> 35:00.347
I think it's gonna be me. For God sakes.

35:01.683 --> 35:04.852
Having you in this office
is gonna give me a stroke.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.899
Yeah. I heard you.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.110
Sorry, Bob. I know you tried,

35:13.195 --> 35:16.363
but Dad's guy in the Bureau says
Givens is out from under already.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.950
Understand this. This thing
that we got with the feds watching us.

35:20.035 --> 35:24.789
We can't have any more heat on us, okay?
So you're on your own, Bob.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.624
It's over. You're out.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.546
Don't.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.719
Have you thought this through?

35:39.805 --> 35:42.431
You know what my father's gonna do to you?

35:42.516 --> 35:45.226
It'd be a short and a lonely life.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.024
Get out of here.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.902
That's awesome. Does it ever jam on you?

36:33.942 --> 36:37.194
You know you're in violation
of a federal court order?

36:37.279 --> 36:39.697
Deputy, didn't your mother teach you
to knock?

36:39.781 --> 36:42.992
Yeah, she did. She also taught me to shoot.

36:43.076 --> 36:46.161
And then my Uncle Sam, he gave me this.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.664
And this is my knock.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.376
Now, is your boss around?

36:52.460 --> 36:54.962
- Do you see my boss around?
- No.

36:55.046 --> 37:01.010
But I bet he was here, then he left,
made you stay and paint the walls.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.387
Can't go wrong with taupe.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.974
He's got the ice-cold, remorseless,

37:07.058 --> 37:10.686
bottle-blond shit-bag killer doing scut work.

37:12.981 --> 37:16.066
Deputy, are you accusing me
of being a fake blond?

37:16.151 --> 37:17.735
Because if you need me to prove it to you,

37:17.819 --> 37:20.821
I might be inclined
to break you over that step ladder,

37:20.906 --> 37:23.240
ride you down like a teaser pony,

37:23.325 --> 37:26.452
and paint this room
an entirely different color.

37:27.412 --> 37:30.623
Now, that is the Wynn Duffy I remember.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.666
- You concerned about me, Raylan?
- Little bit.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.294
- Yeah?
- The SS Quarles is going under.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.756
You best swim like hell to get clear,
or the whirlpool will take you down with it.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.716
I believe they disproved that on MythBusters.

37:40.800 --> 37:41.884
Go tell your boss

37:41.968 --> 37:43.427
- I got the gun that killed Gary.
- Do you?

37:43.511 --> 37:45.262
Ask him where he thinks
it might turn up next.

37:45.347 --> 37:48.015
Deputy, we both know
you're above planting evidence.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.601
Don't think of it like that.

37:50.685 --> 37:55.314
Think of it as just returning that
which does not belong to me.

37:55.398 --> 37:58.567
- That's very thoughtful.
- Way my mama raised me.

37:58.652 --> 38:01.695
Now clean your shit up
and get out of my house.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.249
<i>The beast will come in many forms</i>

38:14.334 --> 38:16.877
<i>for that is the nature of the beast.</i>

38:16.962 --> 38:21.298
<i>The beast will be powerful.
He will be charming. He may even seem wise</i>

38:21.383 --> 38:22.800
Shit.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.761
<i>The beast will present himself as light,</i>

38:26.638 --> 38:29.306
<i>but that light is darkness.</i>

38:29.391 --> 38:34.395
<i>He will appear to be that which shall
deliver us from all our cares and woes.</i>

38:35.563 --> 38:40.943
<i>People will see him, and they will say,
"This is it. He is our salvation."</i>

38:41.027 --> 38:45.823
<i>But do not be deceived.
For in the truth, he is the great deceiver.</i>

38:45.907 --> 38:49.243
<i>We should also call him the great seducer.</i>

38:49.327 --> 38:54.456
<i>For he will do everything in his considerable
power to make us fall in love with him.</i>

38:55.166 --> 38:59.169
<i>You can hate the beast.
You can wish to defeat him with your might.</i>

38:59.254 --> 39:05.009
<i>But do not discount him, for he is the
second most powerful entity in this universe.</i>

39:05.093 --> 39:09.888
<i>You noticed I said second most powerful,
not the first. You know...</i>

39:29.200 --> 39:30.868
That's far enough.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.003
What can I do for you, Mr. Quarles?

39:42.255 --> 39:45.132
You said you like to back the winning side.
