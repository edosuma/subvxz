01:37.583 --> 01:40.666
It's over here. Come on.
He's still breathing.

01:40.666 --> 01:43.541
Why ain't the sheriff come?

01:43.541 --> 01:46.166
Detained by other
business, ma'am.

01:46.166 --> 01:49.166
Had the time when he was up
for election, didn't he?

01:49.166 --> 01:52.125
He sent me along
as soon as you called,
Mrs. Zeller.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.750
Is you supposed
to be qualified?

01:54.750 --> 01:57.125
I'm a trained
officer of the law.

01:57.125 --> 01:58.791
( sighs )

01:59.458 --> 02:02.291
He's under there.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.958
I was out crabbing.
I came back through here.

02:05.958 --> 02:08.083
I saw him.

02:08.083 --> 02:10.916
He waved his hand like
he wanted me to join him.

02:10.916 --> 02:12.583
Did he say anything?

02:12.583 --> 02:14.000
I didn't go near him.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.458
All manner
of dark doings afoot.

02:19.458 --> 02:23.416
At night
there's voices moaning.

02:23.416 --> 02:26.125
Come daylight,

02:26.125 --> 02:28.375
you don't know
what you'll find.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.083
Go.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.791
Do your job.

02:50.625 --> 02:53.875
Misfortune or mayhem?

03:03.166 --> 03:04.791
It's a hog.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.250
What?

03:06.250 --> 03:08.250
A hog.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.708
A dead hog.

03:09.708 --> 03:13.291
It ain't a murdered body?

03:13.291 --> 03:15.583
No, ma'am.

03:15.583 --> 03:18.500
He waved me forward.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.833
Must be his leg.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.916
You gonna tell
the sheriff?

03:22.916 --> 03:24.875
Most surely will.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.708
You don't know half
of what goes on here.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.916
Well, you see
anything suspicious,

03:28.916 --> 03:31.333
you let me
or Sheriff Lindsay know.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.041
Who are you?

03:34.375 --> 03:35.500
I'm the deputy, ma'am.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.791
You can ask for me,
Enoch Thompson.

03:37.791 --> 03:40.125
You don't know
what's going on.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.666
( groaning )

03:52.083 --> 03:54.500
( straining )

03:54.500 --> 03:55.958
Oh, come on.

03:58.791 --> 03:59.875
Fucker.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.666
Oh, fuck.

04:06.666 --> 04:09.208
( men chatting )

04:11.541 --> 04:14.166
( phone ringing )

04:18.875 --> 04:20.458
What gives?

04:21.500 --> 04:23.166
He's either wrestling
an alligator,

04:23.166 --> 04:24.791
or he's still
on the toilet.

04:24.791 --> 04:25.916
Thought the powder
was supposed to give
you the runs.

04:25.916 --> 04:29.041
My brother don't do
nothing normal.

04:32.958 --> 04:34.541
Hello.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.750
Cockroach!
Cockroach!

04:37.750 --> 04:39.916
- ( men laughing )
- Kill it! Kill it!

04:39.916 --> 04:41.791
I got it.

04:47.750 --> 04:48.791
Any progress?

04:48.791 --> 04:51.416
"History doesn't
repeat itself,

04:51.416 --> 04:53.041
but it does rhyme."

04:53.041 --> 04:54.916
Fuck does that mean?

04:54.916 --> 04:57.250
- A riddle?
- Sounds like poetry.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.416
I call Nucky Thompson
the other night.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.500
Tell him Luciano's gonna
be gunning for him again.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.125
That's his response.

05:04.125 --> 05:07.375
Was he drunk?
I mean, if he's anything
like his brother...

05:07.375 --> 05:08.791
( men laugh )

05:08.791 --> 05:12.000
What do I think?
It's a message.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.541
It's like a...
what do you call it?

05:14.541 --> 05:17.625
- An omen.
- An omen.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.500
That we need
to be on our toes.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.083
All that bullshit
with the income taxes.

05:21.083 --> 05:24.166
- What are you worried about?
- First they pinch Ralphie.

05:24.166 --> 05:27.375
- Then they go after Jake.
- Ralph: We're gonna
beat it, Al.

05:27.375 --> 05:30.166
I mean, fucking lawyers
got them tied up in knots.

05:30.166 --> 05:32.875
So what?
I'm supposed to
just make it easy?

05:38.375 --> 05:39.958
Now, the whole operation,

05:39.958 --> 05:43.083
- we've got to move it.
- How you mean?

05:43.083 --> 05:45.583
The books, the cash,
all that to Cicero.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.708
- Al, you got any idea
how hard that's gonna be?
- By tomorrow.

05:48.708 --> 05:49.833
Tomorrow?

05:49.833 --> 05:51.791
Why wait, huh?

05:51.791 --> 05:53.000
Get it out of here.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.000
What, you got
something better to do?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.083
No, of course not.

06:00.083 --> 06:00.875
( sniffs )

06:04.625 --> 06:07.333
That was Owney Madden.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.666
His friend's in town.
The actor.

06:09.666 --> 06:11.958
Wanted to stop by
and say hello.

06:11.958 --> 06:15.125
( laughs )
They're gonna make
a movie about me.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.000
You hear?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.416
Fuck.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.583
It's hot
in New York, right?

06:23.833 --> 06:25.291
The weather.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.375
Okay.

06:27.375 --> 06:29.333
( knocks on door )

06:39.041 --> 06:40.666
Mr. Thompson?

06:40.666 --> 06:43.958
Mr. Doyle needs
to see you straightaway
in the office.

06:43.958 --> 06:47.500
- Who are you?
- Joe Harper, sir.

06:48.666 --> 06:50.750
Mr. Doyle says
it's urgent.

06:52.041 --> 06:53.458
Take this down
to the car.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.500
Yes, sir.

07:08.958 --> 07:10.708
Has Ronis called back yet?

07:18.083 --> 07:22.500
Well, I'll leave
you two to catch up.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.666
( door closes )

07:29.666 --> 07:32.291
I ain't carrying nothing.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.875
Fella downstairs
saw to that.

07:35.875 --> 07:37.791
That wouldn't stop a man
who's made up his mind.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.625
Something to reckon with.

07:42.416 --> 07:44.458
You letting that
knocker run things now?

07:44.458 --> 07:46.166
Mickey?

07:46.166 --> 07:49.000
His personality
suits the operation.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.166
This place worse
than my old juke.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.541
Times change.

07:52.541 --> 07:55.375
You always find a way.

08:00.666 --> 08:02.625
Doesn't anyone
drink anymore?

08:02.625 --> 08:04.750
I ain't come here
for that.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.125
What happened?

08:07.125 --> 08:10.666
Run with some boys
for a while.

08:10.666 --> 08:13.916
Storefronts,
gas stations.

08:13.916 --> 08:17.125
One night they leave
me ass in the wind.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.375
Can't say
I ain't earned it.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.458
Done some time.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.125
I heard you were
still doing it.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.625
You wrong for once.

08:39.916 --> 08:43.291
I'm sorry for all
of it, Chalky.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.708
I ain't come here
for no sympathy either.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.500
- I don't know
where Narcisse is.
- You could find him.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.333
That's not something
that would do either
of us any good.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.708
You can't say
what's good for me.

08:56.083 --> 08:59.958
Your family moved
to St. Louis years back.

08:59.958 --> 09:02.791
They're living under
your wife's maiden name.

09:02.791 --> 09:04.833
( scoffs )

09:04.833 --> 09:06.833
Knock on the door,

09:06.833 --> 09:09.125
they say welcome home.

09:09.125 --> 09:09.791
You don't know
what'll happen.

09:09.791 --> 09:12.750
I'm a wanted man.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.916
Ain't stepped in daylight
in more than a week.

09:15.916 --> 09:18.583
Then you can stay here
under protection.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.416
I owe you that.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.458
There's no sense
looking back.

09:24.458 --> 09:28.000
The only think you can do
is start again.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.958
I really believe that.

09:28.958 --> 09:31.541
We ain't schoolboys
no more.

09:31.541 --> 09:33.750
We're not dead either.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.958
That leaves a lot of road
in the middle.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.541
Maybe you just don't
see the end of it.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.750
I have an appointment
in New York.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.833
I can't put it off.

09:46.833 --> 09:50.083
I want you to stay here.

09:50.083 --> 09:54.416
We'll work something out
and hope for the best.

09:54.416 --> 09:57.291
Since when
you so positive?

09:57.291 --> 09:58.916
I've always been this way.

10:06.583 --> 10:09.000
Take it.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.708
We ain't do no business.

10:10.708 --> 10:13.083
This is between friends.

10:22.083 --> 10:25.041
( man yodeling )

10:32.541 --> 10:35.916
( heavy breathing )

10:35.916 --> 10:38.750
( moaning )

10:39.625 --> 10:40.958
( knocking on door )

10:43.708 --> 10:45.750
Eli:
Just a second.

10:53.416 --> 10:56.583
( knocking )

10:59.416 --> 11:00.916
You had me worried sick.

11:00.916 --> 11:02.416
I've been waiting
at the station.

11:02.416 --> 11:05.000
I overslept.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.958
What the hell is this?

11:09.958 --> 11:13.541
Well, I'm not positive,
but I think it's a baby.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.083
Hello to you, too.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.625
When did...

11:28.625 --> 11:30.500
My last visit.

11:30.500 --> 11:31.708
Labor Day?

11:31.708 --> 11:35.458
I'm seven months along.

11:35.458 --> 11:38.041
And you don't
say a word?

11:38.041 --> 11:40.666
All the letters,
the phone calls.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.083
You're under
enough pressure.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.750
What could you have done?

11:46.750 --> 11:49.208
It's not as if
you'd be coming
home, is it?

11:52.416 --> 11:54.583
( exhales )

11:57.083 --> 11:57.791
Doesn't matter.

12:00.916 --> 12:02.625
I'm happy.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.875
I'm very happy.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.666
You need to eat.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.375
Take care
of your appearance.

12:16.375 --> 12:19.416
And cut down
on the drinking.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.625
I'm not.

12:21.625 --> 12:23.625
I mean, I am.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.208
I'm trying hard.
I'm doing it.

12:26.208 --> 12:29.083
Really.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.000
And now that
you're gonna...

12:38.541 --> 12:39.791
I need you, June.

12:39.791 --> 12:43.125
I need you
to come out here

12:43.125 --> 12:45.083
and bring Dermott,
Kathleen.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.291
They're not done
growing up.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.000
And now a baby.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.083
What about your brother?

12:50.083 --> 12:52.125
My life's got
nothing to do with his.

12:52.125 --> 12:56.083
He wouldn't send
the allowance anymore.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.416
I don't want you
touching that money again.

12:58.416 --> 12:59.958
I'm moving up the ladder.

12:59.958 --> 13:03.291
Best thing that ever
happened to me.

13:03.291 --> 13:06.083
And we'd be together.

13:06.666 --> 13:09.750
It's a blessing.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.375
A chance to start over.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.958
Not everyone gets that.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.416
Are we eating
at that awful chophouse?

13:41.416 --> 13:45.000
No. No, no.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.875
Mm-mmm.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.375
We're getting
a home-cooked meal.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.291
My partner invited us.

13:51.291 --> 13:54.541
His wife did.
She wants to meet you.

13:56.916 --> 13:58.958
( women muttering )

14:03.791 --> 14:05.458
Are you busy?

14:05.458 --> 14:07.000
What's wrong?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.291
Charlotte.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.583
I don't have time.
Read this.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.958
- It explains everything.
- Man: She's in here.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.500
Protect your fur.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.458
- Come on, Charlotte.
- No, no, no, no.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.625
No, no, no, no.
Don't take my teeth.

14:21.625 --> 14:24.125
No, Martin loves
my smile.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.375
- No!
- Wash it! Wash it!

14:25.375 --> 14:28.000
- ( screaming )
- I got her. Get the door.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.333
Wash it. Wash it.
Wash it. Wash it.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.833
Wash it. Wash it.
Wash it. Wash it.
Wash it. Wash it.

14:32.833 --> 14:35.458
Wash it. Wash it.
Wash it.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.708
( record playing )

14:44.708 --> 14:45.916
( fan rattling )

14:49.583 --> 14:51.833
( sighs )

14:51.833 --> 14:54.416
Don't make sense.

14:55.458 --> 14:58.041
Maranzano guaranteed
your safety.

14:58.041 --> 15:01.291
He said I have nothing to fear.
That's not the same thing.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.291
Maybe Al got it wrong.

15:03.291 --> 15:05.125
Or Luciano was acting
on his own.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.750
He runs his mouth,
Charlie,

15:07.750 --> 15:09.750
but he still dances
to Maranzano's tune.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.125
Not if Maranzano was dead.

15:14.375 --> 15:15.625
Al said that, too?

15:15.625 --> 15:17.000
I just told you he did.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.958
Of course.

15:18.958 --> 15:20.916
Fucking hearing loss.

15:23.583 --> 15:24.916
Is Anne here?

15:24.916 --> 15:27.458
She's at bingo.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.208
It's warm
for this time of year.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.958
( scoffs )
I had the fan on
last night.

15:35.416 --> 15:38.041
Jeez, my manners.
What can I get you?

15:38.041 --> 15:39.000
Whatever you're drinking
would be terrific.

15:40.791 --> 15:43.708
First thing
Anne thinks of

15:43.708 --> 15:45.750
when someone walks
into the house.

15:45.750 --> 15:46.958
The perfect hostess.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.500
Always tending
to the domestic side.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.083
Funny what we take
for granted.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.583
Like your health.

15:56.583 --> 15:59.291
Which is why you
should retire.

16:02.958 --> 16:05.083
You piss one of them off?

16:05.083 --> 16:07.416
Luciano or Lansky?

16:08.958 --> 16:11.583
It's business, John.
I'm in the way.

16:11.583 --> 16:14.333
You hungry?
I'll make you
a cheese melt.

16:14.333 --> 16:14.833
I'm fine, thanks.

16:17.125 --> 16:17.916
What time you meeting
Maranzano?

16:17.916 --> 16:20.625
7:30 at his restaurant.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.875
I'll meet you
over there.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.916
We'll get to the bottom
of this.

16:24.916 --> 16:27.666
I didn't mean
to get you involved.

16:27.666 --> 16:29.916
Hey, we either friends
or we ain't.

16:29.916 --> 16:33.583
Obviously Luciano
should not be present.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.208
I'll call Maranzano
beforehand.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.166
Lay it all out for him.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.166
If nothing else,
he's a man of reason.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.875
( sighs )

16:44.041 --> 16:47.333
( men shouting )

16:47.333 --> 16:49.500
Lindsay:
You go out on that
call this morning?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.541
You were right about her.

16:51.541 --> 16:54.666
- What'd she see this time?
- Body under the old Iron Pier.

16:54.666 --> 16:56.708
And?

16:56.708 --> 16:59.458
Hog. Got washed
away somehow.

16:59.458 --> 17:00.958
Old biddy's had me jumping
the last 20 years.

17:00.958 --> 17:03.375
Next time it'll be
the Jersey Devil.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.125
She is the Jersey Devil.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.208
( laughs )

17:07.208 --> 17:10.790
That girl of yours,
Mabel?

17:10.790 --> 17:13.375
Mrs. Lindsay approved.

17:13.375 --> 17:16.000
And I defer to her
in all such matters.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.208
I don't think
her father does.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.790
Of me, I mean.

17:19.790 --> 17:22.750
I'll vouch for
your character.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.250
And your salary.

17:24.250 --> 17:27.040
Obliged to sort it
out myself.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.750
You ever eat
at the Oyster House?

17:30.750 --> 17:33.333
New place in Ducktown?
Mighty dear.

17:33.333 --> 17:35.166
That's the point.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.458
He treats me like
I'm some beggar boy.

17:37.458 --> 17:40.208
I'm gonna sit down
with him tonight,

17:40.208 --> 17:41.750
show him I...

17:41.750 --> 17:44.000
- Afternoon, Pat.
- Mr. Halligan.

17:47.041 --> 17:49.875
If it ain't the law
west of the Pecos.

17:49.875 --> 17:51.291
How's that?

17:51.291 --> 17:53.625
Catch the Rolling
Chair Robber yet?

17:53.625 --> 17:54.833
I heard he snatched
a lady's parasol

17:54.833 --> 17:57.000
in front of God
and everybody.

17:57.000 --> 17:57.875
We're hot on his trail.

17:59.708 --> 18:02.166
And little Ragged Dick.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.250
How's the hat game
these days?

18:05.666 --> 18:07.583
Sailing right along, sir.

18:07.583 --> 18:10.166
You're a slick one.

18:10.166 --> 18:12.666
Gentlemen.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.666
- ( knocks )
- It's us.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.708
Commodore:
Come in.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.708
Lou. Leander.

18:25.708 --> 18:28.041
Have a cigar, Jacob.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.833
You, too, Deputy.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.708
Much obliged.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.333
See our friend just now?

18:34.333 --> 18:35.791
Looked a bit
out of joint.

18:38.208 --> 18:39.875
Had a...

18:39.875 --> 18:42.458
proposal, I guess
you'd call it.

18:42.458 --> 18:45.041
What's that?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.625
Mr. Halligan wishes
to renegotiate

18:47.625 --> 18:50.000
certain terms of
a long-standing agreement.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.583
Got the idea in his head
that I'm beholden to him

18:52.583 --> 18:54.541
for what I built
with my own two hands.

18:54.541 --> 18:56.375
That won't hunt.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.458
It's a goddamn squeeze
from New York

18:58.458 --> 19:00.000
and I won't stand for it.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.458
- How are you set?
- What are we talking about?

19:02.458 --> 19:04.375
Keeping this town in the hands
of those who own it.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.000
Mr. Halligan
has his friends.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.583
They're not my friends
and I don't want to
see them around.

19:14.416 --> 19:16.041
We'd need to
deputize some men.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.083
Let's say about 20.

19:22.083 --> 19:25.333
Post them
at the train station,
the ferries.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.791
Regular checks
at the hotels.

19:26.791 --> 19:30.250
Anyone we don't like
the look of,

19:30.250 --> 19:31.916
see 'em off.

19:33.958 --> 19:35.541
Just enforcing
the vagrancy laws.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.916
Nothing illegal about it.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.125
That's one order
of business.

19:45.125 --> 19:45.833
What's the other?

19:48.875 --> 19:49.958
Let's you and I
discuss that.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.000
Wait out on the porch.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.750
Commodore:
How's he getting along?

20:02.750 --> 20:04.875
Lindsay:
He's a good boy.
Works hard.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.041
Keeps his mouth shut.

20:06.041 --> 20:09.708
Commodore:
A bit of a mooncalf to me.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.500
Lindsay:
What's the task at hand?

20:11.500 --> 20:13.958
Commodore:
Keeping this town in the hands
of those who own it.

20:13.958 --> 20:17.333
( recorder playing )

20:21.291 --> 20:24.250
( claps )

20:24.250 --> 20:27.708
♪ Make new friends. ♪

20:27.708 --> 20:28.750
Eli.

20:28.750 --> 20:32.250
Huh?
Yeah, very catchy.

20:32.250 --> 20:35.166
And very appropriate.

20:35.166 --> 20:36.791
You think so?

20:36.791 --> 20:38.541
I can play
"Greensleeves," too.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.250
The supper will be
getting cold.

20:42.291 --> 20:46.916
( playing )

20:46.916 --> 20:50.250
Chester, that would sound
better much further away.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.000
Luciano doesn't
know your name.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.250
Let him say what he wants.
He can't prove anything.

21:01.250 --> 21:05.000
That didn't stop
Capone from sticking
a gun in my mouth.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.916
Yeah, well, that's just
poor leadership.

21:06.916 --> 21:09.583
You think you won't
be implicated?

21:09.583 --> 21:11.333
You know all about me.
He'll go to work on you.

21:11.333 --> 21:14.500
- You'll fold.
- Hey, whoa, where do you
get off saying...

21:14.500 --> 21:17.000
You'll fold and it
won't help either of us.
Think about that.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.375
Then what do you
want to do?

21:21.375 --> 21:22.791
I, for one, refuse
to be ruled by fear.

21:22.791 --> 21:25.583
- Husband.
- Coming, dear.

21:29.750 --> 21:30.958
Well, I'd just like to say
how pleased we both are

21:30.958 --> 21:33.875
to have been invited
to your home.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.208
Eli tells me
you're a wonderful cook.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.250
What else would he say?

21:40.541 --> 21:42.875
Smells delicious,
doesn't it?

21:42.875 --> 21:45.625
The baby,
you wish it will be what?

21:45.625 --> 21:47.458
A boy?

21:47.458 --> 21:50.000
Well, we have
four of each, so...

21:50.000 --> 21:51.125
we do need a tiebreaker.

21:51.125 --> 21:53.041
Though either, truly,
is a blessing.

21:53.041 --> 21:56.125
As we well know ourselves,
don't we, dear?

21:56.125 --> 21:57.708
What is it we know?

21:57.708 --> 22:01.541
That boys and girls
each add

22:01.541 --> 22:03.041
their own magic
to a family.

22:03.041 --> 22:06.916
Hmm, where do people
get these illusions?

22:06.916 --> 22:09.750
( whispers )
My real mother died.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.958
She was a ballerina.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.750
Such a charming
little bungalow.

22:15.750 --> 22:18.041
George here
built it himself.

22:18.041 --> 22:21.250
- Is that so?
- A kit from Sears...

22:21.250 --> 22:22.666
The roof leaks
for always.

22:22.666 --> 22:26.333
Oh, well,
maybe Eli can help.
He's very handy.

22:26.333 --> 22:29.458
This is true?

22:29.458 --> 22:31.791
You come during
daytime maybe.

22:31.791 --> 22:34.500
When husband is not
at home or working,

22:34.500 --> 22:37.166
making the pickups.

22:39.041 --> 22:41.083
Sounds like a two-man
job to me.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.833
Maybe it's better if I...

22:42.833 --> 22:45.500
He fixes washing machine
and then he breaks it.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.666
The belt snapped, dear,
on its own accord.

22:48.666 --> 22:53.583
Only one man is needed.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.833
The way they make
things nowadays,

22:55.833 --> 22:57.875
such shoddy
workmanship.

23:02.000 --> 23:02.916
May I have
the flatbread?

23:21.083 --> 23:22.958
Thank you,
Mrs. Rothstein.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.833
Mrs. Thompson.

23:32.125 --> 23:35.000
Old Rumpus Associates?

23:35.000 --> 23:38.458
It's a holding company
incorporated in New Jersey.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.250
Funds from an
out-of-state bank will
take longer to clear.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.833
Considering the unusual
nature of the settlement,

23:43.833 --> 23:46.250
I'd like to make sure
the money's in place first.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.083
No.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.250
I'm sorry?

23:49.250 --> 23:51.333
I said no.

23:51.333 --> 23:54.208
This is the deal.
The only deal.

23:54.208 --> 23:56.875
In order to protect
my client's interests...

23:56.875 --> 23:58.500
Give me that.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
We appreciate
your discretion

24:02.000 --> 24:04.500
in this rather
unfortunate incident.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.500
You're right where
you belong, aren't you?

24:07.500 --> 24:09.333
Perhaps I am.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.833
Conors:
Let me see you out.

24:27.125 --> 24:29.250
You've been married
this whole time?

24:29.250 --> 24:31.083
Yes.

24:31.083 --> 24:32.458
You routinely associate
with criminals?

24:32.458 --> 24:34.875
So it would seem.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.291
And now
I'm involved as well.

24:36.291 --> 24:38.666
Obviously.

24:41.375 --> 24:45.916
Will I have the privilege
of thanking your husband
personally?

24:45.916 --> 24:48.250
He does nothing
from the goodness
of his heart, sir.

24:48.250 --> 24:50.333
You should know that
from the outset.

24:50.333 --> 24:52.583
Well, what does he
have in mind?

24:52.583 --> 24:54.333
It's not always easy to tell.

24:54.333 --> 24:57.166
But you can begin by setting
up an account for him.

24:57.166 --> 24:58.791
Under an assumed name.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.708
For what purpose, exactly?

25:00.708 --> 25:04.375
To set about shorting
the stock of the Mayflower
Grain Corporation.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.541
( piano tuning )

25:10.250 --> 25:12.041
( men shouting )

25:16.208 --> 25:18.166
I rode the rails.

25:18.166 --> 25:19.500
Back in '09.

25:19.500 --> 25:23.125
Reading to Buffalo.

25:25.916 --> 25:28.083
Mighty frigid up there.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.750
Not the weather,
the broads.

25:30.750 --> 25:33.083
- ( laughs )
- ( Buzzer sounds )

25:34.791 --> 25:37.625
( buzzer sounding )

25:39.000 --> 25:40.791
See who it is.

25:50.875 --> 25:53.000
I hear you can
tune a piano,

25:53.000 --> 25:54.458
but can you
tune a fish?

25:54.458 --> 25:57.166
( laughs )

25:57.166 --> 26:00.333
- Tuna...
- He's looking for somebody.

26:00.333 --> 26:03.208
Gavin Lynnquist.
United States Marshal.

26:05.166 --> 26:08.041
- You were here last week.
- And you weren't.

26:08.041 --> 26:12.125
I'm looking for the previous
owner, Albert White.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.333
Colored fella,
goes by Chalky.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.875
What'd he do?

26:18.416 --> 26:20.833
He has a noticeable
scar across his face.

26:20.833 --> 26:23.375
Let me guess.
He swiped a watermelon.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.791
( laughs )

26:24.791 --> 26:28.416
Killed a prison guard
at a work farm in Maryland.

26:28.416 --> 26:31.333
Also the convict
he escaped with.

26:31.333 --> 26:35.333
See? I knew there was
trouble behind those eyes.

26:35.333 --> 26:38.458
Mr. White
is a known fugitive.

26:38.458 --> 26:42.083
You could be charged
with aiding and abetting
if you harbor a criminal.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.208
And if I turn him over?

26:43.208 --> 26:44.666
Well, then you have
nothing to fear.

26:44.666 --> 26:47.583
May even be a reward.

26:47.583 --> 26:48.666
Hmm.

26:48.666 --> 26:51.416
I'm gonna hold you
to that.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.416
Come on.

26:58.666 --> 27:00.000
- Right there.
- Albert White.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.916
Put down the knife
and raise your hands.

27:03.916 --> 27:06.750
You!
Albert White!

27:06.750 --> 27:09.250
Put down the knife
or I'll shoot.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.333
Hands above your head.

27:13.166 --> 27:13.916
Turn around slow now.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.833
Name's Jenkins, sir.

27:22.916 --> 27:24.458
That's not him.

27:24.458 --> 27:26.208
- A scar, you said.
- That isn't him.

27:26.208 --> 27:30.166
One coon's good
as another is what
I always say.

27:34.958 --> 27:35.833
Come back anytime now.

27:44.291 --> 27:48.000
Oh, there you are.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.833
( laughs )

27:52.458 --> 27:54.041
- Let me get that.
- It's a woman's work.

27:54.041 --> 27:57.416
I'm gonna stand on
ceremony in your condition?

27:57.416 --> 27:59.291
The boys will do it.
Come on, George.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.708
Very well.

28:01.708 --> 28:04.041
Relax.
Listen to the radio.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.458
It's almost time
for Rudy Vallee.

28:06.458 --> 28:08.000
My Kathleen adores him.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.291
I have an idea.
Can we play it, Mother?

28:09.291 --> 28:11.291
Play what?

28:11.291 --> 28:13.625
The record.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.541
I am tired
of the record.

28:15.541 --> 28:17.250
Please, please, please.

28:18.583 --> 28:19.875
Have your
childish pleasure.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.125
( music playing )

28:33.333 --> 28:35.125
Let's just take it
one step at a time...

28:35.125 --> 28:37.041
I am not
running anymore.

28:37.041 --> 28:39.041
Before you box
yourself into a corner.

28:39.041 --> 28:40.916
I'm not running.

28:40.916 --> 28:43.041
It's rattling
around in his head.
He's not gonna let it go.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.333
- I am not running.
- You can't just keep...

Nothing.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.416
Remember what?

30:03.416 --> 30:05.833
Oh, Jesus.

30:08.083 --> 30:09.916
Will someone tell me
what's going on?

30:10.666 --> 30:13.458
You lie to yourself.

30:13.458 --> 30:15.458
- Excuse me?
- Okay, look, we need...

30:15.458 --> 30:18.125
- Who are you to say
anything about lying?
- We got to go.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.875
You lie. You lie.
You lie.

30:20.875 --> 30:23.750
But I will tell
the truth.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.791
Your man and me,

30:25.791 --> 30:27.750
we fuck.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.250
You see, in the kitchen
on the chair.

30:30.250 --> 30:33.083
Fucked and fucked
and fucked.

30:33.083 --> 30:36.750
When husband is at work
making the collections.

30:36.750 --> 30:38.583
What?

30:38.583 --> 30:40.416
June...

30:40.416 --> 30:42.125
- Daddy!
- Abigail,
go to your room.

30:42.125 --> 30:43.875
She said bad words.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.375
( knocking on door )

30:46.375 --> 30:48.458
I will answer it.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.958
That woman...

30:50.958 --> 30:53.625
You need me here?

30:56.541 --> 30:59.041
Let's take a ride.

31:01.166 --> 31:04.333
- This isn't a good time.
- We got to talk...

31:06.333 --> 31:08.000
Nelson.

31:08.541 --> 31:10.541
You, too...

31:10.541 --> 31:13.375
Sheriff Thompson.

31:15.541 --> 31:19.750
( music playing )

31:19.750 --> 31:22.875
( dice rattling )

31:22.875 --> 31:26.041
( sobbing )

31:28.250 --> 31:31.083
Blubber!

31:34.416 --> 31:37.416
Blubber!

31:39.541 --> 31:40.875
Blubber!

31:57.958 --> 32:00.083
( changes station )

32:00.083 --> 32:02.500
( voices speaking on radio )

32:20.000 --> 32:21.416
Dr. Cotton?

32:24.250 --> 32:27.291
What did he do to you?

32:36.541 --> 32:39.541
Butterscotch Krimpet.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.916
I saved it for you.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.416
Is it your mouth?

32:49.416 --> 32:49.916
Did he...

32:53.958 --> 32:57.250
The sickness
was someplace else.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.958
( gasps )

33:19.250 --> 33:20.666
They've given me
a first grade class.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.375
It's just what
I've asked for.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.166
They can be
an unruly lot.

33:25.166 --> 33:27.500
No, they're
the perfect age.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.708
Just hungry
to learn everything.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.250
And free
from old prejudice.

33:31.250 --> 33:36.833
What is lacking
among the schoolchildren
in Camden?

33:36.833 --> 33:39.125
You said you wished for me
to choose my own path.

33:39.125 --> 33:41.666
Did I?

33:41.666 --> 33:42.833
This town is set to be
a comer, Mr. Jeffries.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.541
Good place
to stake your claim.

33:45.541 --> 33:47.375
In all your
vast experience?

33:47.375 --> 33:51.750
Well, yes.
If you don't mind
my saying so.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.291
I think it's a young
person's duty

33:54.291 --> 33:56.583
to go where opportunity
most presents itself.

33:56.583 --> 33:58.083
Why aren't you heading
off to the Klondike?

33:58.083 --> 34:01.083
Enoch isn't going
to the Klondike, Father.
That's absurd.

34:01.083 --> 34:03.125
I'd go if that's
where ambition led.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.583
I won't allow that.

34:04.583 --> 34:07.125
There's nothing but rough
men and bear grease.

34:07.125 --> 34:09.500
There's riches
to be found right here.

34:09.500 --> 34:13.666
Atlantic City
has doubled in size
over the last decade.

34:13.666 --> 34:16.541
10,000 tourists
coming in every day
when the season's on.

34:16.541 --> 34:19.958
He's going to mine
people instead of gold.
That's much easier.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.875
From bellboy
to deputy sheriff.

34:22.875 --> 34:25.916
Every story
has a beginning, sir.

34:28.083 --> 34:29.916
I have a mission for you.

34:29.916 --> 34:34.541
Seek out and purchase me
a pack of Fatimas.

34:34.541 --> 34:36.958
You wish me
to be absent.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.458
I wish for a pack
of Fatimas.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.250
May I smoke one?

34:42.250 --> 34:44.250
I'll whip you
if you do.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.083
You're completely
monstrous.

34:51.875 --> 34:52.916
( whispers )
Be steadfast.

35:04.541 --> 35:06.791
Mr. Jeffries...

35:06.791 --> 35:09.291
I'll talk
and then you can say
what you want.

35:09.291 --> 35:13.125
Now, I've never denied
Mabel anything

35:13.125 --> 35:15.125
because I knew
it was pointless.

35:15.125 --> 35:17.041
She is quite willful.

35:18.041 --> 35:21.125
I don't know
what she sees in you,

35:21.125 --> 35:23.250
and I say that with
no intent to offend.

35:23.250 --> 35:25.666
You seem diligent
and earnest

35:25.666 --> 35:28.666
and you have certainly
demonstrated persistence.

35:28.666 --> 35:31.333
I should admire
those qualities,

35:31.333 --> 35:33.208
but somehow I don't.

35:34.416 --> 35:35.333
I wouldn't expect you to.

35:35.333 --> 35:38.500
Why is that?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.958
We're fighting over
the same thing.

35:40.958 --> 35:42.791
One of us
is bound to lose.

35:45.541 --> 35:47.625
I mean to marry Mabel.

35:47.625 --> 35:51.333
I mean to provide for her

35:51.333 --> 35:52.166
and the family
we'll raise together.

35:52.166 --> 35:54.791
How?

35:54.791 --> 35:57.208
By getting myself ahead.

35:57.666 --> 35:58.958
Prove it.

35:58.958 --> 36:01.541
I can't prove it
to you sitting here.

36:01.541 --> 36:03.833
Prove it to yourself.

36:03.833 --> 36:06.333
I don't have to prove
what I already know.

36:06.333 --> 36:09.041
I don't think you do know.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.125
Oh, I think you
talk a bold line.

36:12.125 --> 36:14.500
I think you have a nose

36:14.500 --> 36:18.166
for figuring out what
people would like to hear,

36:18.166 --> 36:19.833
but I don't think
you know what you are.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.250
Well, sir, I suppose
we'll both find that out.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.416
I smoked one anyway.

36:35.416 --> 36:38.125
I expected
nothing less.

36:51.541 --> 36:53.333
( speaks Italian )

36:58.791 --> 37:00.291
It's bold.

37:00.291 --> 37:03.083
And you, Mr. Thompson,
you are bold.

37:03.083 --> 37:06.041
Enough to come here
and stand before me now.

37:06.041 --> 37:08.500
Then we're not waiting
for Mr. Torrio?

37:14.625 --> 37:17.583
When are you
going to get rid
of Charlie Luciano?

37:17.583 --> 37:19.291
He disappoints me.

37:19.291 --> 37:20.708
That is true.

37:20.708 --> 37:23.000
He'll come for me again

37:23.000 --> 37:24.625
and then he'll
come for you.

37:24.625 --> 37:27.208
When one sits on the throne,
that is to be expected.

37:28.666 --> 37:31.416
I do not take
such things personally.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.166
What's more personal
than a man trying
to kill you?

37:35.166 --> 37:37.166
Fides. Trust.

37:37.166 --> 37:38.875
Loyalty.

37:38.875 --> 37:40.041
The foundation
of the Roman Empire.

37:40.041 --> 37:42.583
Didn't Caesar get
a knife in the back?

37:42.583 --> 37:44.333
( chuckles )

37:44.333 --> 37:47.541
Still, I prefer to deal
only with Italians.

37:47.541 --> 37:50.958
Where does that leave me?

37:50.958 --> 37:52.666
You are Malta.

37:52.666 --> 37:54.083
An island unto yourself.

37:54.083 --> 37:57.583
Loyal to Rome,
but exempt from Roman law.

37:57.583 --> 38:00.250
And Roman tribute as well?

38:00.250 --> 38:02.166
( laughs )

38:02.166 --> 38:05.041
Mr. Torrio assures me
that you're a man

38:05.041 --> 38:06.875
who knows how
to return a favor.

38:07.833 --> 38:10.083
But we can hear it
from him.

38:11.750 --> 38:13.041
Abajo!

38:13.041 --> 38:15.208
( woman screams )

38:20.083 --> 38:20.916
Get out of my way!

38:30.291 --> 38:33.458
( tires squeal )

38:33.458 --> 38:36.916
( woman screams )

38:36.916 --> 38:39.625
( people clamoring )

38:39.625 --> 38:42.000
( man coughing )

38:43.250 --> 38:45.041
( owl hooting )

38:45.041 --> 38:46.833
( knocks )

38:46.833 --> 38:49.500
( dog barking )

38:51.500 --> 38:54.083
May I come in?

39:00.125 --> 39:00.833
Sorry to disturb.

39:00.833 --> 39:03.250
Is something wrong?

39:03.250 --> 39:05.500
No, ma'am.
Just county business.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.291
Come sit down.

39:07.291 --> 39:11.166
It's all right.
How's Ruth?

39:11.166 --> 39:14.000
Back on her feet.
Baby's thriving.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.166
Glad to hear it.

39:29.541 --> 39:30.375
Well?

39:30.375 --> 39:33.958
The jobs you do

39:33.958 --> 39:35.625
for the Commodore...

39:35.625 --> 39:36.583
What jobs are those?

39:36.583 --> 39:39.916
That have their own rules.

39:39.916 --> 39:41.458
I could help with those.

39:41.458 --> 39:42.416
No one asked you to.

39:42.416 --> 39:44.666
I'm offering now.

39:44.666 --> 39:47.375
That's not
how it works.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.583
Go home.

39:51.583 --> 39:53.500
It's late.

39:54.875 --> 39:56.958
We'll talk about it
some other time.

40:10.666 --> 40:13.958
I do appreciate you taking
the time for me, Dr. Cotton.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.625
I know how
burdened you are.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.875
What an awful lot
of responsibility.

40:20.875 --> 40:23.916
I don't regard it
a burden.

40:25.208 --> 40:29.500
A chance to help those
unable to help themselves.

40:29.500 --> 40:33.625
And I wanted to tell
you personally

40:33.625 --> 40:36.458
that I've made
a full recovery.

40:37.833 --> 40:39.875
You have?
When?

40:39.875 --> 40:44.625
There wasn't
an exact moment.

40:45.708 --> 40:48.875
But I'm seeing
clearly now.

40:48.875 --> 40:51.250
Thinking clearly.

40:51.250 --> 40:53.458
What is it you want?

40:53.458 --> 40:56.208
I'm sure there are
formalities to observe,

40:56.208 --> 40:58.916
but I'd like
to start the process.

40:58.916 --> 41:00.708
Which process is that?

41:00.708 --> 41:02.875
The process
of being released.

41:05.291 --> 41:08.458
Why were you
brought to us?

41:10.666 --> 41:12.958
I took someone's life...

41:15.708 --> 41:18.125
in a state
of temporary insanity

41:18.125 --> 41:20.750
out of grief.

41:22.375 --> 41:23.875
You know you were ill?

41:25.333 --> 41:27.041
I do.

41:27.041 --> 41:28.833
And now you know
you're not?

41:28.833 --> 41:30.208
Yes.

41:30.208 --> 41:33.041
How?

41:34.041 --> 41:36.625
How do you know
what you are?

41:38.583 --> 41:41.791
How do you know?

41:43.166 --> 41:48.000
The concept of temporary
insanity is troublesome.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.291
Some might say convenient
for the afflicted.

41:51.291 --> 41:53.541
Rational before the act,

41:53.541 --> 41:54.750
rational after,

41:54.750 --> 41:57.791
but in that one instance...

41:57.791 --> 41:59.750
It was the jury's
decision.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.958
Where does insanity go?

42:03.958 --> 42:09.125
Malaria, syphilis,
tuberculosis,

42:09.125 --> 42:11.250
these linger
in the tissues.

42:11.250 --> 42:14.708
They hide from sight
only to reemerge.

42:14.708 --> 42:16.958
They are in
the body forever

42:16.958 --> 42:18.375
unless they're rooted out.

42:18.375 --> 42:22.208
I'm better.

42:22.208 --> 42:25.291
I've been helped.

42:25.291 --> 42:26.791
I'm grateful.

42:26.791 --> 42:28.500
But are you cured?

42:28.500 --> 42:32.750
Are you cured?

42:32.750 --> 42:36.125
We'll find
what's inside you.

42:36.125 --> 42:38.250
We'll fix it.

42:39.666 --> 42:41.750
You don't need
to worry about that.

42:54.041 --> 42:55.208
Could you not
do that?

42:55.208 --> 42:57.375
Do what?

42:57.375 --> 43:00.791
Stare at me.

43:00.791 --> 43:03.000
Am I making you
uncomfortable?

43:05.416 --> 43:09.083
The event
you're thinking about...

43:11.291 --> 43:14.333
that was an accident.

43:14.333 --> 43:16.541
Plain and simple.

43:17.708 --> 43:19.916
You mean like a streetcar
hitting a horse?

43:21.708 --> 43:24.916
A man getting his head
crushed in a metal press?

43:24.916 --> 43:27.291
A gas explosion

43:27.291 --> 43:30.041
in which bystanders

43:30.041 --> 43:32.583
are literally torn
limb from limb?

43:33.916 --> 43:36.416
That's what your having
sexual relations

43:36.416 --> 43:38.291
with my wife was like?

43:38.291 --> 43:39.791
Look...

43:42.541 --> 43:46.166
I don't know
about you, but...

43:46.166 --> 43:49.083
my life is
a fucking shipwreck.

43:49.083 --> 43:51.833
Well, land ho.

44:21.500 --> 44:22.833
Put that away.

44:22.833 --> 44:23.958
We need you sober.

44:29.250 --> 44:31.375
Frank:
The prohibition
officer you drowned,

44:31.375 --> 44:33.583
the justice
investigator you shot

44:33.583 --> 44:35.250
while fleeing custody.

44:35.250 --> 44:37.375
And a lot more
I'm guessing won't
be hard to find.

44:37.375 --> 44:39.500
Special Agent
James M. Tolliver.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.750
- Killed in the line of duty.
- I don't know who that is.

44:41.750 --> 44:45.291
That's funny.
We found his teeth
all over your living room.

44:45.291 --> 44:46.791
Some colored broke in.

44:46.791 --> 44:49.375
He the one
knocked up your wife?

44:50.416 --> 44:53.250
Nobody cares
about your problems.

44:53.250 --> 44:56.708
End of the road,
gentlemen.

44:56.708 --> 44:58.375
You can cooperate
with us...

44:58.375 --> 44:59.916
Or you can see
how things look from
inside the gas chamber.

45:05.750 --> 45:08.416
What do you want
us to do?

45:10.041 --> 45:12.041
There isn't a court
in Cook County

45:12.041 --> 45:13.708
that would put
Alphonse Capone in jail.

45:13.708 --> 45:16.125
They're all in his pocket.

45:16.125 --> 45:18.875
But he can't fight
the Bureau of Internal
Revenue.

45:18.875 --> 45:21.250
We're making a case
for tax evasion.

45:21.250 --> 45:23.833
( laughing )

45:23.833 --> 45:25.208
You think this
is a joke?

45:25.208 --> 45:26.416
No.

45:26.416 --> 45:29.333
Not with all the penalties
and interest.

45:29.333 --> 45:33.000
He has to report the money,
legal or not, otherwise...

45:33.000 --> 45:35.166
Five years in a federal
penitentiary, minimum.

45:35.166 --> 45:37.291
If we can prove
the income.

45:41.375 --> 45:43.041
Key to the count room.

45:47.750 --> 45:49.375
Combination to the safe.

45:49.375 --> 45:52.333
- We need the ledger books.
- You're gonna get them for us.

45:52.333 --> 45:54.291
Why don't you
do it yourself?

45:54.291 --> 45:56.625
Because we're
the expendable ones.

45:56.625 --> 45:59.708
Capone's out all night

45:59.708 --> 46:01.708
showing some Hollywood
types around.

46:01.708 --> 46:05.125
Skeleton crew at the Lex,
so it's as easy as it's
ever going to be.

46:05.125 --> 46:06.875
You're making
a drop-off.

46:06.875 --> 46:10.125
- Excess cash.
- Then what?

46:10.125 --> 46:11.458
Do what you need to.

46:11.458 --> 46:13.583
But you're getting
those books tonight.

46:13.583 --> 46:15.750
And he goes to jail?

46:15.750 --> 46:18.333
He certainly won't
otherwise.

46:18.333 --> 46:19.708
You both wore badges.

46:19.708 --> 46:21.833
Here's your chance
to earn them.

46:25.500 --> 46:26.833
Those ledgers
are written in code.

46:26.833 --> 46:30.875
Yeah, well,
you met Ries.

46:30.875 --> 46:31.625
Fella who keeps
the books.

46:31.625 --> 46:33.166
He's screwy about bugs.

46:33.166 --> 46:34.875
Right.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.500
He's agreed
to cooperate.

46:37.500 --> 46:40.000
( sobbing )

46:44.125 --> 46:44.958
Haven't you?

46:47.666 --> 46:51.375
Get them off of me!
Get them off of me!

46:51.375 --> 46:54.541
( wailing )

46:54.541 --> 46:56.750
It's a fucking
slaughterhouse.

46:56.750 --> 46:59.083
The bulls roped off
the entire block.

46:59.083 --> 47:01.166
There's no telling
who's dead and who's alive.

47:03.125 --> 47:04.375
Who were the shooters?

47:06.625 --> 47:09.666
Better you don't know.
Keep out of it.

47:09.666 --> 47:11.041
Well, I'm involved now,
ain't I?

47:11.041 --> 47:14.416
We're grateful
for everything you done.

47:14.416 --> 47:16.208
Your advice,
your counsel.

47:16.208 --> 47:18.625
And as the syndicate
moves forward,

47:18.625 --> 47:21.083
it'll only get stronger.

47:21.083 --> 47:23.291
- And your involvement will
be an important part...
- ( Phone ringing )

47:25.375 --> 47:26.666
Yeah?

47:26.666 --> 47:30.208
We waited for you, John.

47:31.666 --> 47:33.166
For quite some time.

47:33.166 --> 47:35.208
Nucky?

47:39.000 --> 47:42.791
I called.
Didn't you get
the message?

47:42.791 --> 47:45.125
Actually, I did.

47:45.125 --> 47:47.791
And now I have
a message for you

47:47.791 --> 47:51.000
and the two pissants
you're in league with.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.166
I will not rest

47:53.166 --> 47:55.416
until I see you
in your graves.

48:07.333 --> 48:09.833
Are you gonna do
your job or what?

48:09.833 --> 48:12.500
I pay taxes like anybody.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.958
You tell the sheriff that.

48:13.958 --> 48:18.291
He needs to come
sort out doings here.

48:19.875 --> 48:23.291
I don't feel safe
in my own bed anymore.

48:23.291 --> 48:26.125
The things
that go on at night.

48:26.125 --> 48:27.833
You can hear them.

48:27.833 --> 48:30.500
You can hear the...

48:30.500 --> 48:33.250
you can hear the souls

48:33.250 --> 48:35.083
all moaning.

49:15.291 --> 49:18.250
Ronis:
Bad news, I'm afraid.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.916
I've been calling
you for days.

49:19.916 --> 49:21.583
Inquiries had to be made

49:21.583 --> 49:23.750
about something they say
did not occur.

49:23.750 --> 49:25.500
Just tell me.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.708
Miss Wheet was detained
at the roadblock

49:27.708 --> 49:29.833
outside Havana
after curfew.

49:29.833 --> 49:31.916
There was a dispute
with the soldiers.

49:31.916 --> 49:34.125
She fired a gun.

49:34.125 --> 49:36.000
She died on the spot.

49:37.458 --> 49:38.916
I don't believe it.

49:38.916 --> 49:42.208
That will not change
what happened.

49:45.166 --> 49:47.875
I want the names
of those responsible.

49:47.875 --> 49:50.458
I'll pay
whatever it costs.

49:50.458 --> 49:53.333
There are no names,
Mr. Thompson.

49:55.208 --> 49:57.291
Then who will be called
to account?

49:58.958 --> 50:00.791
No one, I am afraid.

50:28.458 --> 50:30.875
( music playing )

50:30.875 --> 50:32.000
( knocking )

50:41.833 --> 50:43.833
- Sir.
- Come to see
about a girl.

50:43.833 --> 50:47.458
Then you won't
be disappointed.

50:49.375 --> 50:50.958
Need to pat you down.

50:50.958 --> 50:52.958
Had a ruckus
few nights back.

50:52.958 --> 50:55.041
Fine by me.

50:56.625 --> 50:58.000
Only looking to make
one kind of noise.

51:04.041 --> 51:05.708
This way.

51:05.708 --> 51:08.000
( knocks )

51:08.000 --> 51:10.416
First room
on the left.

51:15.875 --> 51:18.625
- Evening, Clarence.
- Evening, Mr. Jake.

51:18.625 --> 51:19.916
Clarence:
New rules.

51:19.916 --> 51:21.208
Got a little rough.
Got to pat you down.

51:21.208 --> 51:23.916
- Jake: Amelia here?
- Yeah, Amelia here.

51:23.916 --> 51:27.375
Alicia, too.
All your favorite girls.

51:27.375 --> 51:27.875
Jake:
Sophia as well?

51:32.041 --> 51:34.125
Hey there, darling.

51:38.500 --> 51:41.208
- Woman: How you doing?
- Let me take you upstairs.

51:41.208 --> 51:43.416
( laughs )

51:43.416 --> 51:44.958
Woman:
Come on, don't be shy.

51:44.958 --> 51:45.833
Woman ♪2:
I know you see something.

51:45.833 --> 51:48.500
Woman:
Oh, come on back.

52:02.208 --> 52:03.791
Mama?
