00:01.610 --> 00:02.002
NCIS#190
"Enemy on the Hill"
Closed Captioned

00:05.440 --> 00:08.008
MAN:
Okay, we're set.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.227
Later this week, Congress
will be voting on

00:10.271 --> 00:13.187
a $14 billion appropriation
for construction

00:13.230 --> 00:15.319
of a new class
aircraft carrier.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.669
Many watchdog groups feel that
the money would be better spent

00:17.713 --> 00:20.194
at home, on schools
and infrastructure.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.760
Your opinion?

00:21.804 --> 00:25.329
Well... uh, that's a difficult
question for me to answer.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.463
I don't really know
what the military needs.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.726
That's a husband question.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.642
I'd have to talk to him to
see how I feel about it.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.252
Thank you.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.602
Your honesty is
refreshing.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.169
MAN:
Okay, we're good.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.128
Chad, the guy with
the camera over there.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.477
Excuse me, sir,
ZNN.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.174
Can we interview you
for the evening news?

00:44.218 --> 00:45.262
No. No.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.481
It'll only
take a second.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.004
Please, don't point
that at me.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.092
Please, sir, if
you could just...

00:49.136 --> 00:51.268
[tires squealing]

00:51.312 --> 00:53.488
[people screaming]

00:56.752 --> 00:59.059
Someone call 911!

01:34.094 --> 01:36.008
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs.

01:36.052 --> 01:36.922
Whoa, whoa, Abby,
what, what?

01:36.966 --> 01:38.098
You're not going
to believe it.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.186
I was chosen.

01:39.229 --> 01:40.230
I'm a match.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.710
They want me down
at the hospital

01:41.753 --> 01:43.146
for an interview right away.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.582
What, you donating
bone marrow again?

01:44.626 --> 01:46.062
No. A kidney.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.368
Who do you know that
needs a kidney?

01:47.411 --> 01:48.891
I don't know him.
I just volunteered.

01:48.934 --> 01:51.154
Abby, slow down. Back up.
What are you talking about?

01:51.198 --> 01:52.634
I heard about
it at church.

01:52.677 --> 01:53.983
There's this 18-year-old kid,

01:54.026 --> 01:55.724
he's on dialysis,
and he needs a kidney,

01:55.767 --> 01:57.421
but nobody in his family
was a match,

01:57.465 --> 01:58.683
so I had to do something.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.207
So I went down to the
hospital and got tested,

02:00.250 --> 02:02.034
and they just called me.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.993
You're going to give a perfectly
good kidney to a total stranger?

02:04.036 --> 02:06.038
Are you out of your mind?That is very noble.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.127
Abby, that's major surgery.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.302
What's the recovery
time on that?

02:08.345 --> 02:09.520
It's gotta be weeks.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.218
Well, I don't know,
but I'll find out.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.654
I have an interview with

02:12.697 --> 02:14.177
the transplant coordinator in,
like, an hour.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.092
Hey, Gibbs.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.486
Hey, Detective Sportelli,
what are you doing here?

02:18.529 --> 02:19.704
Long time.
I gotta go.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.011
Abby, don't you commit
to anything.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.708
It's gonna be great.

02:25.493 --> 02:26.581
Sportelli, what's up?

02:26.624 --> 02:28.235
I arrested The Cooler.

02:30.019 --> 02:33.457
Come on, FBI's most-wanted list.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.067
It's a career-making bust.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.243
The Cooler?

02:36.286 --> 02:37.461
He puts people on ice.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.202
Yeah, he's suspected
in at least a half-dozen

02:39.246 --> 02:41.291
high-profile contract
assassinations.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.380
Right.The only thing tying
the cases together

02:43.424 --> 02:45.121
is the slugs taken
from the victims.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.384
Yeah, he's been like a ghost,
blending into the background.

02:47.428 --> 02:50.039
FBI has no idea what he looks
like, let alone have a name.

02:50.082 --> 02:50.996
They got one now.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.302
Paul Arliss.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.435
He's been living the good life
in suburbia.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.480
On a cul-de-sac
in Woodley Park.

02:56.524 --> 02:57.655
How'd you catch him?

02:57.699 --> 02:59.440
News crew doing
on-the-street interviews.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.138
He tried to avoid the camera
and ran into traffic.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.706
Got hit by a van.
He's in critical condition.

03:04.749 --> 03:07.056
I saw footage of that
on the news last night.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.711
They did not mention anything
about him being a fugitive.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.627
We kept it quiet till
we figured out who he was.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.324
You gotta keep that quiet.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.630
Shh.

03:15.673 --> 03:16.979
You wouldn't want
anyone to know.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.546
Great work,
Detective Sportelli.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.243
You arrested the
unconscious man.

03:20.287 --> 03:24.334
Did you have to cuff him when he
was down on the sidewalk there?

03:26.206 --> 03:29.687
How'd you I.D. him?Ballistics tied the weapon
he was carrying

03:29.731 --> 03:31.167
to four unsolved hits.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.995
You here to gloat?

03:33.038 --> 03:34.997
No, I'm here to help you.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.564
We found surveillance
photos

03:36.607 --> 03:38.522
and handwritten notes
in his car,

03:38.566 --> 03:40.045
parked about
a block away.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.047
Looks like his next target

03:42.091 --> 03:46.269
is going to be a Navy Lieutenant
Commander named Geoffrey Brett.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.271
GIBBS: You got any leads
on who hired Arliss?

03:48.315 --> 03:50.621
Nope.
Well, we need
to interview him.

03:50.665 --> 03:51.753
Where is he?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.363
Washington General
Hospital prison ward.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.366
I'll call you when
he's able to speak.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.020
Great detective work,
Sportelli.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.065
I think we're all
very proud of you.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.111
Always a pleasure, DiNozzo.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.289
Boss, Commander Brett's

04:06.333 --> 04:07.290
an Academy grad.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.378
Top Gun pilot.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.379
Flew F-18 Hornets

04:09.423 --> 04:10.685
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.991
Got shot down over
Kunar Province.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.341
TONY:
Wait a second.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.690
I know him.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.300
That's the guy that
survived by eating

04:17.344 --> 04:20.303
mud, bark and bugs
while evading the Taliban.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.435
McGEE:
Yep. Took the Marines

04:21.478 --> 04:23.132
two weeks to find
and rescue him.

04:23.175 --> 04:26.614
One tough S.O.B.
McGEE:
He's divorced,

04:26.657 --> 04:27.876
has one daughter.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.704
Currently assigned as a
legislative fellow

04:29.747 --> 04:32.663
to the House Armed
Services Committee.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.665
[phone ringing]

04:34.709 --> 04:37.102
MAN:
Good afternoon.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.322
Lieutenant Commander
Brett's office.

04:39.366 --> 04:43.021
BRETT: You say this guy
was trying to kill me.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.285
Got a good reason
to believe so.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.112
ZIVA: He's a wanted
contract killer.

04:47.156 --> 04:48.244
[chuckles]

04:48.288 --> 04:49.985
This is crazy.

04:50.028 --> 04:52.466
I can't think of anyone
who would want me dead.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.424
So, uh, it's got
to be a joke.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.993
Captain Thornton put you up
to this, didn't he?

04:58.036 --> 04:59.473
GIBBS:
I don't know Captain Thornton.

04:59.516 --> 05:02.345
BRETT: Well, clearly this must
be some sort of mistake.

05:02.389 --> 05:06.001
Metro police came to us
with solid evidence.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.568
Well, you said
the guy's been caught,

05:07.611 --> 05:09.004
so there's nothing
to worry about.

05:09.047 --> 05:11.354
Whoever hired him to kill you,
wants you dead.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.617
They'll find someone else
to do the job.

05:13.661 --> 05:16.098
We would like to put you
in protective custody
until we know more.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.708
You're serious?

05:17.752 --> 05:19.449
[chuckles]

05:19.493 --> 05:20.668
I can take care of myself.

05:23.192 --> 05:26.326
My job is to advise the members
of the Armed Services Committee.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.632
There's a critical vote about
to take place on the Hill

05:28.676 --> 05:31.374
regarding a substantial
military expenditure.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.420
I'm going to be in sensitive
meetings all week.

05:33.463 --> 05:36.248
Why don't you let an agent
shadow you at work.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.381
We'll set you up tonight
at the officers' quarters

05:38.425 --> 05:40.209
at the Navy Yard.Yeah, I don't know, I've...

05:41.210 --> 05:44.692
And who will be the
agent shadowing me?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.399
Hi, Ducky.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.661
Just a second, Abby.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.403
I'm just finishing
cleaning and lubricating

06:00.447 --> 06:03.711
the Hornby model of my
namesake-- "The Mallard."

06:03.754 --> 06:05.582
Magnificent locomotive.

06:05.626 --> 06:09.630
It set the world speed record
for a steam engine back in 1938.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.154
126 miles per hour.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.286
It was on a slight downgrade

06:14.330 --> 06:16.158
between Bytham
and Essendine.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.246
[chuckles]

06:17.289 --> 06:20.380
Remained in service
until 1960...

06:21.685 --> 06:23.426
Abby?

06:23.470 --> 06:25.733
What's the matter?

06:25.776 --> 06:27.212
Do you have a minute?

06:27.256 --> 06:28.518
Certainly.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.694
I just came from
the hospital.
I heard.

06:30.738 --> 06:37.440
Donating a kidney is not a
decision to be taken lightly.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.007
The transplant coordinator

06:39.050 --> 06:41.618
said that I'm not the
only one that's a match.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.403
There's also a guy.
Really?

06:43.446 --> 06:45.230
Well, usually it's hard to find
one donor that's a match.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.450
Yeah, exactly.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.973
That's why she
was amazed that

06:49.017 --> 06:51.585
she found a brother and a
sister both willing to donate.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.544
Your brother also volunteered?

06:54.588 --> 06:56.459
No. I spoke to Luca.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.982
He doesn't know
anything about it.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.506
I'm confused.

06:59.549 --> 07:02.639
Why does the transplant
coordinator think

07:02.683 --> 07:05.642
that you and this man
are siblings?

07:05.686 --> 07:07.383
As part of the
screening process,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.690
we had to give a
mitochondrial DNA sample.

07:09.733 --> 07:12.127
Ours was a dead-on match, Ducky.

07:12.170 --> 07:15.347
More than 99.9%.

07:15.391 --> 07:20.004
I mean, we have to be full-on
brother and sister, right?

07:20.048 --> 07:22.529
I-I pressed the coordinator
for details on the guy--

07:22.572 --> 07:24.618
like his name and address,
but she clammed up,

07:24.661 --> 07:26.620
saying she'd said
too much already.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.317
It's pro forma
for all donors'

07:28.360 --> 07:31.973
medical and personal records
to be kept confidential.

07:32.016 --> 07:34.671
Could my parents have had
another child

07:34.715 --> 07:37.326
they gave up for adoption?

07:37.369 --> 07:39.546
I mean, it doesn't
make any sense.

07:39.589 --> 07:40.982
I don't believe it.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.679
And neither does
my little brother Luca.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.638
He's as blown away
as I am.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.509
With your parents deceased,

07:46.553 --> 07:48.729
isn't there anyone
else you can ask?

07:50.687 --> 07:53.081
Thanks for listening.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.087
[siren wailing]

07:59.130 --> 08:00.958
I think we should have
waited for Gibbs.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.656
No time. Sportelli said
he was conscious.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.005
We don't know
for how long.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.659
Now, listen, when we
get into the room,

08:05.702 --> 08:07.182
you let me do the talking.Why?

08:07.225 --> 08:09.097
The Cooler's evaded
the FBI for years.

08:09.140 --> 08:12.013
Getting him to tell us who took
out the hit on Commander Brett

08:12.056 --> 08:13.318
is going to take
a deft hand.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.972
Oh, and that's you?

08:15.016 --> 08:17.322
You didn't even know who The
Cooler was until I told you.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.672
Neither did Ziva.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.630
No, I need to talk
to Arliss alone,

08:20.674 --> 08:22.676
so you've got to get
Sportelli out of the room.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.634
And how am I supposed
to do that?

08:24.678 --> 08:26.244
Well, I don't know--
you distract him.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.333
Talk about your stupid
obsession with jet packs--

08:28.377 --> 08:30.031
men strapped to rockets.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.641
Hey, I am not obsessed.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.121
Special agents.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.340
You're not going to get
to talk to Arliss, boys.

08:35.384 --> 08:36.516
You said we could.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.256
He flatlined.He's dead?

08:38.300 --> 08:41.216
Over and out.

08:48.919 --> 08:51.443
Hard to believe this guy
was an infamous killer.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.620
Up until yesterday,
his only claim to fame

08:53.663 --> 08:55.012
was salesman of the year

08:55.056 --> 08:57.493
as a manufacturer's rep
for a furniture company.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.974
He's got a wife, two kids,
no criminal record.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.497
Not even
a parking ticket.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.978
He evaded the FBI for years
by hiding in plain sight.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.502
In a weird way, you got
to admire the guy...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.417
He's a mass murderer.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.679
Despicable.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.246
Nothing to admire.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.465
Did you connect Arliss to anyone
who knows Commander Brett?

09:13.509 --> 09:15.032
Not yet. Metro's got a team
going through his house.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.469
If only I could have
interrogated him, I tell ya.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.384
Five minutes
in my magic hands

09:19.428 --> 09:20.472
and I would
have had him

09:20.516 --> 09:22.387
coughing up the name
of that hit man.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.606
Five minutes?Five minutes,

09:23.650 --> 09:25.652
because I learned from the best.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.610
We need to find out
who hired him.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.872
I've been looking
for enemies.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.049
But Commander Brett is
a decorated hero.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.399
He's well-liked.
Spoke to his former C.O.

09:34.443 --> 09:35.792
Brett climbed over some people

09:35.836 --> 09:37.577
while angling for his plum
assignment on the Hill,

09:37.620 --> 09:39.056
but no one denies
he deserved it.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.493
While angling for
his plum assignment on the Hill?

09:41.537 --> 09:42.712
Who talks like that?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.890
I'm already five minutes late.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.631
Is your day always
this busy?

09:48.675 --> 09:50.067
Some are worse.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.504
Especially when
there's a big vote.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.681
It's the first time I've
ever been accompanied

09:54.724 --> 09:56.552
by a woman who's packing.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.554
Huh. Packing?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.643
Carrying a gun.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.907
Why does someone who looks like
you become an NCIS agent?

10:03.951 --> 10:06.562
What are agents
supposed to look like?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.042
Stern, surly, humorless.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.435
Agent Gibbs.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.523
The problem with you guys

10:11.567 --> 10:12.742
is you're too uptight.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.962
Try lightening up
a little.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.790
Hey...

10:16.833 --> 10:18.530
Agent Ziva, relax.
I know him.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.010
Relax.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.142
[groans]

10:21.185 --> 10:23.405
Sorry, Nick. You okay?

10:23.448 --> 10:24.406
Yeah. No!

10:24.449 --> 10:25.581
What the hell
is going on?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.888
Nick, NCIS Special
Agent Ziva David.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.890
NCIS?

10:29.933 --> 10:31.021
They mistakenly believe
I need protection.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.806
It's nothing really.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.025
You just roughed up one
of the barons of K Street.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.071
He's trying to avoid using the
pejorative. I'm a lobbyist.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.029
Listen, are you going
to be in your office
later this afternoon?

10:39.073 --> 10:40.291
I need to talk
to you about something.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.858
Yeah, I'll be back
around 4:00.
Okay, great.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.468
Nice meeting you, I think.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.086
Thanks for being so discreet.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.617
What the hell's
DiNozzo doing?

11:03.793 --> 11:05.577
I don't know.

11:08.145 --> 11:10.104
Are you sure
about Arliss' wife?

11:10.147 --> 11:12.976
She thought he was on the road,
selling furniture.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.413
Be my guest. Talk to her.
Look around.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.633
Better move fast.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.808
FBI's on their way.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.418
They're taking over.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.985
Hate those guys.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.117
Glory hounds.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.075
I'd rather deal with you
than the Bureau.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.642
I don't blame you.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.599
Hey, boss!

11:32.126 --> 11:33.475
Something's wrong here.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.521
I paced off the inside
and outside of the garage.

11:36.565 --> 11:37.740
There's a couple
feet missing.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.742
Looks like there's
some electrical power

11:39.786 --> 11:41.091
going behind this wall.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.619
Sounds hollow.

11:47.663 --> 11:50.710
There's something
back here.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.106
GIBBS:
There's a seam.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.460
That's interesting.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.160
[latch clicks]

12:15.822 --> 12:17.127
Eureka.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.042
SPORTELLI: The FBI'S gonna have
a field day.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.783
GIBBS:
Oh, yeah, they will.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.483
Do you want to let us
take the computer?

12:25.527 --> 12:26.963
Our people are real good.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.400
Yeah, ourpeople are real good.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.793
You'll tell me what
you find, Gibbs.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.534
Yeah, sure.

12:33.970 --> 12:37.887
ABBY: No, this
doesn't have anything

12:37.931 --> 12:39.454
to do with a sweepstakes.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.977
I...

12:42.631 --> 12:45.503
No, no, I'm Abigail,

12:45.547 --> 12:47.941
your niece...
Gloria's daughter?

12:47.984 --> 12:49.116
[hushed]:
What're you doing?

12:49.159 --> 12:50.378
I found something on
Arliss' computer.

12:50.421 --> 12:51.945
I need to clone
his hard drive.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.598
Do you have
your USB-3 cable?

12:53.642 --> 12:56.123
Oh, yeah.

12:56.166 --> 12:59.126
No, no, I'm not
a cheerleader anymore.

12:59.169 --> 13:02.738
I graduated high school
a long time ago.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.392
Um, I'm sorry.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.394
I can't bring you bonbons now.

13:06.437 --> 13:09.397
I live in
Washington, DC now.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.400
I'll visit soon,
yeah, I promise.

13:12.443 --> 13:16.404
No, this is, this is Abby.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.579
Abby Sciuto.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.756
Okay, Aunt Gert,

13:20.800 --> 13:24.412
go have your dinner.

13:24.455 --> 13:25.108
Okay.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.415
Love you. Bye.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.424
McGEE:
Abby, you okay?

13:36.467 --> 13:38.992
I just thought
if anyone would know
about my parents

13:39.035 --> 13:40.558
giving up a child,
it'd be my Aunt Gert,

13:40.602 --> 13:44.040
but she can't even remember
her own name, poor thing.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.129
Her dementia's
gotten so bad.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.391
That your aunt?

13:47.435 --> 13:49.567
No, it's my mom.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.918
Wow, she was beautiful.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.746
She was beautiful.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.183
What'd you find?

13:56.226 --> 13:58.141
Well, the day before Arliss
was hit by the truck,

13:58.185 --> 14:01.405
he received
a $25,000 wire transfer

14:01.449 --> 14:02.406
from the brokerage account

14:02.450 --> 14:03.755
of a "George Kaplan."

14:03.799 --> 14:05.888
$25,000.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.891
That's how much it costs to get
somebody whacked these days?

14:08.935 --> 14:13.374
Mr. Kaplan lives at 1313
Branchport Avenue, Northwest,

14:13.417 --> 14:15.855
apartment 3C.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.857
Abby?

14:21.077 --> 14:22.818
I wish you could spend
the night, honey,

14:22.862 --> 14:23.993
but something has come up

14:24.037 --> 14:25.908
and Daddy has to stay in
the city, okay?

14:25.952 --> 14:27.344
I'll talk to your mother.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.564
We'll see if we can work out
something for the weekend.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.566
Yes, I promise.

14:31.609 --> 14:34.569
Okay, I love you,
sweetheart. Bye.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.571
How old is she?

14:36.614 --> 14:38.878
Eight.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.925
She, uh, she has special needs,
but she doesn't let it stop her.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.623
She's a great kid.

14:46.624 --> 14:49.105
Hm. She's adorable.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.367
What's her name?

14:50.411 --> 14:51.847
Matilda.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.109
I call her Tilly.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.024
She's my life.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.983
Agent Gibbs.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.027
You found something.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.725
You know a man
named George Kaplan?

15:00.769 --> 15:02.771
No. Should I?

15:02.814 --> 15:04.468
We believe he put out
the hit on you.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.906
Well, has he been arrested?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.082
No, not yet.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.735
We got a lead on an address.

15:10.779 --> 15:11.649
We're still looking for him.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.390
This is getting crazier.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.871
Why would someone I don't know
want to have me killed? It's...

15:17.003 --> 15:18.482
Should I be concerned
about my daughter?

15:19.179 --> 15:21.877
My ex wanted to take Tilly

15:21.921 --> 15:23.139
to her parent's house
in Hilton Head.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.185
I'm gonna tell her to do it.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.889
What do you expect to see?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.195
I don't know.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.545
You'd think a guy
who popped 25 grand for a hit

15:37.588 --> 15:39.112
would live in better digs
than this.

15:39.155 --> 15:42.854
I've been meaning on
getting that fixed.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.378
McGEE: Boss, this is
the landlady,

15:44.421 --> 15:45.553
Mrs. Roach.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.729
Understand you don't have
a warrant, boss.

15:47.772 --> 15:50.514
I can get one if you want.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.952
Let's get this over with.
I'm missing Judge Judy.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.055
Ugh! Kaplan's got
terrible taste.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.752
The apartment
comes furnished.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.449
I picked everything out.

16:12.493 --> 16:13.885
GIBBS:
How long's Kaplan
been living here?

16:13.929 --> 16:15.713
Over a year.
Maybe a year and a half.

16:15.757 --> 16:16.671
No clothes in the closet.

16:16.714 --> 16:17.977
No food.

16:18.020 --> 16:18.890
When's the last time
you saw Kaplan?

16:18.934 --> 16:21.371
When I rented him the apartment.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.069
You haven't seen him since?Don't think so.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.896
You don't find it strange

16:24.940 --> 16:26.072
that someone rents an apartment
from you then doesn't use it?

16:26.115 --> 16:27.421
He's my best tenant.

16:27.464 --> 16:28.900
Doesn't make any noise.

16:28.944 --> 16:32.687
His business manager sends
a check, every month, on time.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.689
Guy who lives in this dump like
this has a business manager?

16:36.473 --> 16:37.735
No offense.

16:37.779 --> 16:38.910
What's the
business manager's name?

16:38.954 --> 16:40.042
I don't know.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.913
I mean, I got the name
in my apartment.

16:43.132 --> 16:46.483
Now I suppose you want me
to go down and get it.

16:50.618 --> 16:53.447
You wanna come
with me, boss?

16:59.148 --> 17:00.584
I'll wait here.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.588
That's what they call
a "turkey vulture."

17:04.632 --> 17:06.025
20 years past a cougar.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.418
Still likes to hunt, but
too old to take down the prey.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.073
ROACH:
I wouldn't bet on that.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.555
Dust for prints, boss?

17:14.598 --> 17:16.948
Yeah.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.994
It's late.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.082
I'm not that hungry.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.519
Let's just get
to the Navy Yard.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.956
I really don't want
to spend the night there.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.697
Well, hopefully, it
won't be for long.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.091
Let's take the stairs.
It's quicker.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.095
After you.

17:36.490 --> 17:37.578
[latch clicks]

17:38.666 --> 17:39.754
Sorry.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.495
[doorknob rattling]Open it.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.759
Buh-bye.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.633
Brett!
[grunts]

17:59.513 --> 18:01.645
Any response to the BOLO?

18:01.689 --> 18:02.733
No.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.432
I felt, all day,
he wanted to shake me.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.694
It's hard to protect someone
who doesn't want protection.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.957
His cell's still off.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.001
What was his schedule
this morning?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.047
Has to be in
his office by 11:00 a.m.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.267
for a conference call with
Admiral Mosley in Pearl Harbor.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.355
I doubt he'll miss that.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.183
You got anything on Kaplan?

18:17.226 --> 18:19.968
There's no DC driver's license
or passport issued

18:20.011 --> 18:23.232
to a George Kaplan at 1313
Branchport Avenue, Northwest.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.495
We're trying surrounding states,
but it's common name.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.193
There's gonna be a lot of hits.

18:27.236 --> 18:28.194
Military or criminal record?

18:28.237 --> 18:29.586
None.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.414
I got something. Ha-ha!

18:31.458 --> 18:33.590
The Social Security number

18:33.634 --> 18:34.635
of the George Kaplan

18:34.678 --> 18:36.245
on Branchport Avenue.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.639
Why does that name sound
so familiar?

18:38.682 --> 18:39.988
Where'd you get the number?

18:40.031 --> 18:41.207
Kaplan's stockbroker.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.034
Turns out he's got
$1.1 mil in the account

18:43.078 --> 18:45.036
that paid for the hit man.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.037
Broker give you a description?

18:46.081 --> 18:47.343
Doesn't think he ever met him.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.650
Dealt with the business manager,
a Drew Turner.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.957
It's the same name we got
from the landlady.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.133
The broker says
it's not unusual.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.438
Deals with business managers
all the time.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.006
Turns out that Turner had
power of attorney--

18:58.049 --> 18:59.486
all the documentation
you need

18:59.529 --> 19:01.270
to open an account.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.663
Which means he's got Kaplan's
Social Security number

19:02.706 --> 19:04.360
and address,

19:04.404 --> 19:07.711
which has to be a residence;
can't be a P.O. box.

19:07.755 --> 19:08.973
Kaplan files state
and federal tax returns.

19:09.017 --> 19:11.019
prepared by...

19:11.062 --> 19:11.976
...Drew Turner.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.587
Time to talk to him.

19:13.630 --> 19:17.199
DiNozzo, subpoena the records
of Kaplan's account... now.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.033
[doorbell chimes]

19:25.729 --> 19:27.209
Drew Turner?

19:27.253 --> 19:28.210
Yes.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.646
You're a woman.

19:29.690 --> 19:30.995
What gave it away?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.954
NCIS.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.042
Agents McGee and DiNozzo.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.261
We need to speak
with you.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.784
Navy investigators.

19:36.827 --> 19:41.136
I am running really late to
a meeting with the IRS, so...

19:41.180 --> 19:42.442
[phone ringing]

19:42.485 --> 19:44.008
Come on in.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.233
Drew Turner.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.017
Yeah, I just got back
into town this morning.

19:53.061 --> 19:56.151
Listen, they are only auditing
your entertainment expenses

19:56.195 --> 19:58.022
and I'm bringing copies
of all your receipts.

19:58.066 --> 20:01.504
So relax, you have nothing
to worry about, Harry.

20:01.548 --> 20:05.029
Yeah, I, uh, can
meet you in ten...

20:05.073 --> 20:06.640
15 minutes at the most.

20:06.683 --> 20:09.251
Okay, bye.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.471
Nervous client.

20:11.514 --> 20:12.689
First time being
audited. Sorry.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.517
TONY:
Must be nice...

20:14.561 --> 20:15.605
working out of your home.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.607
Never late to work.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.001
Yeah, [chuckles]
I bet.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.438
CPA. So you do personal
tax returns?

20:22.482 --> 20:24.962
Yeah.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.355
It's impressive.

20:26.399 --> 20:29.228
We're looking for a client
of yours, George Kaplan.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.664
Do you know where
we can find him?

20:30.707 --> 20:31.665
Uh, you check his apartment?

20:31.708 --> 20:33.144
Yes.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.494
Okay, uh...
maybe he's out of town.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.496
He seems to move
around a lot.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.411
I haven't seen him
since last tax season.

20:38.454 --> 20:41.022
Can you describe him?George?

20:41.065 --> 20:44.286
Yeah, um, on the shorter
side, five-eight maybe.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.983
Dark hair.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.420
I don't really
know him that well.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.422
I mean, I just helped him
set up an investment account

20:49.465 --> 20:51.293
and do his taxes once a year.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.164
What is this about?

20:53.208 --> 20:56.342
Do you know a Lieutenant
Commander named Geoffrey Brett?

20:56.385 --> 20:57.952
No. Sorry.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.954
And I gotta get going.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.956
I mean, my client is at
at the IRS office and

21:01.999 --> 21:04.001
he is hyperventilating.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.960
Well, we just need you
to come by

21:06.003 --> 21:07.701
the Navy Yard and help us
with a sketch of Kaplan.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.268
Are you gonna be there?

21:09.311 --> 21:10.269
Definitely.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.971
You'll be working with our
forensic scientist Abby Sciuto.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.146
Whatever. I mean,

21:18.189 --> 21:19.495
I'll be there
as soon as I'm done

21:19.539 --> 21:20.627
with the IRS;
let's say an hour,

21:20.670 --> 21:21.584
two at the most?

21:21.628 --> 21:22.585
Sounds good.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.370
Thanks.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.382
BRETT:
How much trouble am I in?

21:36.425 --> 21:38.122
You're not taking the threat
on your life seriously.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.689
You're right, I'm not.
It's bogus.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.301
Fact: a professional
hit man is targeting you.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.476
You have no basis.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.173
I can't, for the life
of me, think of anyone

21:45.216 --> 21:46.217
I've pissed off that bad.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.654
Why'd you ditch me?

21:47.697 --> 21:49.308
Okay, this is awkward.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.005
The truth?

21:51.048 --> 21:52.354
That would be nice.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.703
I was uncomfortable
having you with me

21:53.747 --> 21:56.053
in meetings all day,
but there was no way

21:56.097 --> 21:57.707
I could let you
accompany me last night.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.143
I was with a woman.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.362
She married?
No,

22:00.406 --> 22:02.016
and no jealous ex-boyfriends.

22:02.059 --> 22:03.234
Trust me,
I thought of that.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.366
You two don't get it.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.628
I've got a life to live.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.456
And if anyone's trying
to kill me,

22:07.500 --> 22:10.024
I can take care of myself.

22:12.026 --> 22:14.637
I'm glad this is your detail
and not mine.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.073
Go on.

22:16.117 --> 22:17.248
[groaning sigh]

22:20.382 --> 22:21.644
GIBBS:
What do you got, Abbs?

22:21.688 --> 22:23.124
Whoa, Gibbs,
you scared me.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.169
What are you doing?

22:25.213 --> 22:27.955
Um, I'm searching
male birth records

22:27.998 --> 22:29.652
from Jefferson
Parish, Louisiana.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.393
You find anything?

22:31.437 --> 22:33.308
No.
How'd you make out

22:33.352 --> 22:35.397
with the prints found
in Kaplan's apartment?

22:35.441 --> 22:37.660
Um, I haven't
gotten to them yet.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.314
What about the computer
sketch of Kaplan?

22:39.358 --> 22:41.360
His business manager
never showed up.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.405
Did you tell Tony, McGee?

22:43.449 --> 22:45.407
No.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.235
I've been a little
distracted, Gibbs.
Abbs.

22:48.671 --> 22:49.672
I need you.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.592
I appreciate it.

22:56.636 --> 22:59.421
Broker said he got a
call from Drew Turner,

22:59.465 --> 23:01.075
the hot, sexy
accountant,

23:01.118 --> 23:03.294
last week,
authorizing the money transfer

23:03.338 --> 23:05.949
to Costa Rica
from Kaplan's account.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.604
She told us she hadn't spoken
to Kaplan since last tax season.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.084
She lied.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.651
Well, I guess she won't
be doing your taxes.

23:11.694 --> 23:12.956
I'm going to call Gibbs.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.393
Hold it, probie.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.395
I'm the one who subpoenaed
the brokerage papers.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.222
Uh, yeah, but I'm the one
that traced the transfer

23:18.266 --> 23:19.572
to the gambling Web site.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.321
[phone ringing]

23:30.365 --> 23:32.236
Boss, that's me.No, actually, that was me.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.456
I got Kaplan's
brokerage statement.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.981
Week before the 25 grand
was wired to the hit man,

23:38.025 --> 23:40.157
there was a $500,000
withdrawal.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.594
I tracked it
to an online

23:41.637 --> 23:43.291
gambling Web site
in Costa Rica.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.553
Transaction was initiated

23:44.597 --> 23:46.642
by Kaplan's business manager,
Drew Turner.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.992
We told you that Drew
is a woman, right?

23:49.036 --> 23:50.472
Of course we did.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.953
She is authorized
to sign on the account.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.650
You knew that, too.She told us

23:54.694 --> 23:56.304
she hadn't talked
to Kaplan in months.

23:56.347 --> 23:58.349
We think that little kitty cat
is up to something.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.264
Clearly, she
and George Kaplan

24:00.308 --> 24:01.657
were in this
together.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.964
Turner did not show
to do the sketch with Abby.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.313
Bring her in.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.626
[doorbell chimes]

24:13.669 --> 24:15.671
[rhythmically
snapping fingers]

24:18.718 --> 24:20.023
She's not home.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.635
Car's here.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.420
I'm going to have Abby
track her cell.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.466
[whistling]

24:30.164 --> 24:32.688
[sighs]

24:32.732 --> 24:34.995
What do you expect to see, Tony?

24:35.038 --> 24:37.345
You don't have to track
her cell. She's home.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.956
What's she doing?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.131
Not much.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.003
We better call Gibbs.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.669
SPORTELLI: She's a civilian.
I want the body.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.061
No. We found her.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.063
She's our lead to who
may have put out

25:00.107 --> 25:01.238
the hit out on
the commander.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.676
A lot of good she's
going to do you dead.

25:03.719 --> 25:05.765
She leave
a suicide note?

25:05.808 --> 25:08.724
The late Ms. Turner
did not commit suicide.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.770
What are you talking about?
She hung herself.

25:10.813 --> 25:11.988
GIBBS:
Dr. Mallard,

25:12.032 --> 25:14.077
meet Metro Detective Sportelli.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.036
Good morning.
I'd shake hands, but, uh...

25:16.079 --> 25:17.907
Ah, I'm cool.What are you thinking, Duck?

25:17.951 --> 25:19.909
Well, the hanging
was staged.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.303
How can you tell?Well, to begin with,

25:22.346 --> 25:24.740
suicide by hanging
is very unusual,

25:24.784 --> 25:26.873
uncharacteristic for a female.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.309
So I was suspicious.

25:28.352 --> 25:31.573
Human flesh reacts
differently after death.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.575
When a person
hangs themself,

25:33.619 --> 25:34.924
they are suspended
by the neck

25:34.968 --> 25:36.752
with the weight of the
body pulling downwards.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.580
The ligature
creates a furrow

25:38.624 --> 25:41.757
with a pattern that runs
from the front to the back.

25:41.801 --> 25:44.107
But when the ligature
is applied after death,

25:44.151 --> 25:47.023
as in this case,
you can see it's fairly even.

25:47.067 --> 25:49.548
The tissue, not being
infused with blood,

25:49.591 --> 25:50.549
reacts differently.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.246
It's drier and
more yellowish.

25:52.289 --> 25:54.030
Then how did she die?

25:54.074 --> 25:55.292
Well, I opened
up the neck,

25:55.336 --> 25:58.948
and I found bruising
on her organs

25:58.992 --> 26:00.863
consistent with
manual strangulation.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.039
Ms. Turner was
choked to death,

26:03.083 --> 26:05.215
and then hanged to
make it look as if

26:05.259 --> 26:08.610
the manner of death
was indeed suicide.

26:11.265 --> 26:12.875
TONY:
A cover-up?

26:12.919 --> 26:14.573
Fake suicide?

26:14.616 --> 26:16.226
Think she was killed
by George Kaplan?

26:16.270 --> 26:18.054
What if there
isn't a Kaplan?

26:18.098 --> 26:19.578
The only person other
than Drew Turner

26:19.621 --> 26:22.885
who says that they met
Kaplan is his landlady,

26:22.929 --> 26:24.931
and she's got
a real fuzzy memory.

26:24.974 --> 26:27.063
We've got no photo I.D. of him.

26:27.107 --> 26:30.023
Maybe Drew Turner
was Kaplan.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.546
I don't know.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.548
She doesn't look
like a George to me.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.768
Besides,
the two of them did sign

26:35.811 --> 26:38.205
the authorization card for
the brokerage account.

26:38.248 --> 26:40.903
She could have disguised
her handwriting and signed both.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.992
Faked suicide,
fake names,

26:43.036 --> 26:45.212
women pretending to be men.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.909
This is getting messy.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.695
I tell you what...

26:49.738 --> 26:51.305
I'm out of here.

26:51.348 --> 26:54.569
I'll let you duke it out
with the FBI.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.876
So long, Gibbs.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.530
How does this all tie
into Commander Brett?

26:59.574 --> 27:00.880
We still don't know

27:00.923 --> 27:02.664
why someone
wants him dead.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.580
It's like Deep Throat said
in All the President's Men:

27:05.624 --> 27:06.668
"Follow the money."

27:06.712 --> 27:08.104
There's over a
million bucks

27:08.148 --> 27:09.279
in Kaplan's
account still.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.977
We know what he spent
some of it on.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.674
Paying off
gambling debts,

27:12.718 --> 27:14.676
ordering a hit.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.678
Where'd the money come from?

27:16.722 --> 27:19.028
McGEE: Boss, I'm going to try
and get Abby to compare

27:19.072 --> 27:21.683
both signatures, see if they
were made by the same person.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.032
Try, McGee?

27:23.076 --> 27:25.252
Well, Abby's been
real distracted

27:25.295 --> 27:26.993
by this brother thing.Yeah, I noticed.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.690
She had no luck
finding the guy.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.997
Do your thing.

27:31.040 --> 27:34.130
See what you can find out
about the brother.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.219
Drew Turner?

27:36.263 --> 27:38.657
Nope, never heard the name.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.788
Who is he?

27:39.832 --> 27:41.529
She.

27:41.572 --> 27:43.662
Kaplan's business manager.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.272
She was found dead yesterday.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.884
How did she die?Murdered.

27:48.928 --> 27:51.931
There's a connection
to the hit on you.

27:51.974 --> 27:54.890
That is why you need to stay in
protective custody, Commander.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.682
[chuckling]:
All right.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.727
You convinced me.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.294
I won't fight you anymore.

28:12.299 --> 28:15.737
Look at the spacing between
the letters and the names.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.305
I compared the relative height,
width, size and slant

28:18.348 --> 28:19.872
of the letters
that are common

28:19.915 --> 28:21.743
to both names--
"E," "N" and "R."

28:21.787 --> 28:23.832
The baseline habits
are totally different,

28:23.876 --> 28:25.529
so these signatures

28:25.573 --> 28:27.183
were definitely made
by two separate people.

28:27.227 --> 28:29.577
You sure?

28:29.620 --> 28:30.709
McGee.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.189
Now, look at
Kaplan's signature.

28:33.233 --> 28:36.671
The counter of the "A"s and
the cramped loop of the "E"--

28:36.715 --> 28:38.542
it's a very masculine trait.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.544
So there's a difference

28:40.588 --> 28:42.068
between male and
female handwriting?

28:42.111 --> 28:44.113
Of course.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.854
Well, I was wrong.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.639
There is a George Kaplan,
and he's out there somewhere.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.729
I'm going to dust
the original signature card.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.557
Maybe Kaplan left a print
when he signed it.

28:53.601 --> 28:54.210
Aha!

28:54.254 --> 28:55.821
My dynamic duo.

28:55.864 --> 28:58.649
Does anyone know
where I can find Gibbs?

28:58.693 --> 29:00.782
Uh, think he's still
in the conference room.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.131
What do you got?

29:03.350 --> 29:07.093
♪ I know where Kaplan
got the money. ♪

29:09.573 --> 29:11.793
Can you just try telling us
like a normal human being?

29:11.837 --> 29:13.534
Oh.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.058
All the funds were wired
from the Broussard Banque

29:16.102 --> 29:17.930
in Geneva, Switzerland.Whose account?

29:17.973 --> 29:20.280
I don't know yet.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.151
But I'm going to find out.

29:22.195 --> 29:23.631
See ya!

29:23.674 --> 29:26.939
We got to keep him away
from that new coffee machine.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.553
Geoff, you got a sec?
We need to talk.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.293
I think we're losing
Kenneally's vote.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.166
Hello.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.647
Hi.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.738
I'll let you two talk.

29:46.697 --> 29:48.221
She's still here.

29:48.264 --> 29:49.831
You going to tell
me what's going on?

29:49.875 --> 29:51.702
NCIS says there's been
a threat on my life.

29:51.746 --> 29:54.183
Don't worry.
It's got to be a mistake.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.751
This will all go away
in a couple days.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.884
In the last year and a half,
there have been

29:58.927 --> 30:00.537
four deposits
into George Kaplan's account,

30:00.581 --> 30:03.149
totaling $1.5 million.

30:03.192 --> 30:05.586
They all came from the
Broussard Banque in Switzerland.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.849
Special Agent Survoy
in Marseilles

30:07.893 --> 30:09.938
is currently trying
to find out who authorized

30:09.982 --> 30:11.766
the transfer of funds to Kaplan.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.030
Abby looks like she's
in a better mood.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.292
You got something, Abbs?ABBY: Oh, yeah.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.859
I pulled the prints
of three people

30:17.903 --> 30:19.687
off the brokerage
account signature card.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.732
One was a clerk that
works in the file room.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.822
And Drew Turner,
the business manager.

30:23.865 --> 30:28.174
And-- ta-da-- Lieutenant
Commander Geoffrey Brett.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.132
His fingerprints
are on the card?Oh, there's more.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.091
Look at the
uppercase "G"s,

30:32.134 --> 30:36.791
and then the lowercase
"O"s, "E"s and "R"s.

30:36.835 --> 30:40.186
Those signatures came
from the same person.

30:42.144 --> 30:46.235
Lieutenant Commander
Geoffrey Brett is George Kaplan.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.628
It doesn't make sense.

30:47.671 --> 30:49.891
I mean, what, did Brett
put a hit out on himself?

30:49.935 --> 30:51.284
Did he kill Drew Turner?

31:01.294 --> 31:05.298
We need proof that Brett
and Drew Turner knew each other.

31:05.341 --> 31:08.605
George Kaplan!

31:08.649 --> 31:10.085

Of course.

31:10.129 --> 31:11.391
Oh, I'm slipping.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.354
George Kaplan
is the name of the guy

31:19.747 --> 31:21.531
Brett created Kaplan

31:21.575 --> 31:22.837
to hide the money
he was getting

31:22.881 --> 31:24.752
from the Broussard
Banque in Switzerland.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.580
Drew Turner had to be in on it.

31:26.623 --> 31:28.495
She helped Brett
set the whole thing up.

31:28.538 --> 31:31.106
She opened up a brokerage
account under the fake name,

31:31.150 --> 31:32.325
filed all the
tax returns

31:32.368 --> 31:33.543
and rented an apartment

31:33.587 --> 31:35.328

Oh, really?

31:57.263 --> 31:58.786
So what's the plan?

31:58.829 --> 32:00.831
Gibbs wants you to hang in there
until we know more.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.268
Don't let him out of your sight

think it is?

32:50.533 --> 32:53.754
His name's Kyle Davis?

32:53.797 --> 32:55.277
That's a lot of
responsibility.

32:55.321 --> 32:56.452
What are you
gonna do with it?

32:56.496 --> 32:59.107
I want to meet him.

Okay.

Under the 2009
information-sharing agreement

33:49.462 --> 33:50.767
with the United States,

33:50.811 --> 33:52.421
they gave me the name
of the company

33:52.465 --> 33:54.075
who wired the funds
to "George Kaplan."

33:54.119 --> 33:57.078
It's a foreign subsidiary
of Stembridge Marine.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.298
It's one of the largest naval
shipbuilders in the U.S.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.691
And Brett's the liaison for the
House Armed Services Committee.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.693
For the past year,
he's been running

then they ran the money
through the brokerage account,

39:29.149 --> 39:33.545
I mean, Kyle and me--
our DNA is a total match.

39:33.588 --> 39:36.461
So, we have to have
the same biological parents.

39:36.504 --> 39:40.421
So then I was like, "What, did
they give him up for adoption?

39:40.465 --> 39:45.818
And I-I can't imagine the
wonderful, loving parents

39:45.861 --> 39:49.387
that raised me and Luca
ever giving up a child.

39:51.432 --> 39:52.912
But they would have
adopted a child.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.611
And they did.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.700
Me.

40:02.617 --> 40:05.533
I'm adopted, Gibbs.

40:05.577 --> 40:07.187
How do you know that?

40:12.235 --> 40:14.586
This is my mom's hair.

40:14.629 --> 40:17.632
And I ran a DNA test on it

40:17.676 --> 40:20.243
and I compared it to mine.

40:20.287 --> 40:23.551
It wasn't a biological match,
Gibbs.

40:23.595 --> 40:26.336
So I...

40:26.380 --> 40:30.340
I don't know who I am anymore.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.647
I don't know
who my parents were.

40:32.691 --> 40:37.870
I'm just like...
like Little Orphan Abby.

40:37.913 --> 40:42.352
Abbs... you're still
the same person.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.531
Your parents--
they're still your parents,

40:46.574 --> 40:48.141
as you remember them.

40:50.317 --> 40:57.150
Family's more than just... DNA.

40:58.760 --> 41:05.114
It's about.. people who care
and take care of each other.

41:05.158 --> 41:06.594
I know.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.117
[sighs]

41:08.161 --> 41:11.643
But why didn't they
tell me I was adopted?

41:11.686 --> 41:15.255
I mean, there's
got to be a reason.

41:15.298 --> 41:17.126
And I need to find out

41:17.170 --> 41:22.654
before I completely turn Luca
and Kyle's lives upside down.

41:24.743 --> 41:27.746
You don't have to do
this alone, Abby.

41:29.704 --> 41:31.793
You've got a family.

41:31.837 --> 41:35.405
And we'll help
you through it.
