to assassinate your father,

04:54.260 --> 04:56.090

08:47.460 --> 08:49.760

Hmm?

11:45.730 --> 11:46.930
Barry, come to bed.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.900
We can talk about it.

11:48.900 --> 11:52.010
You know who I wish
was here right now?

11:54.740 --> 11:57.680
My mother.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.750
She's the one
in my head.

12:03.620 --> 12:06.150
She always wanted this
 for me.

12:10.090 --> 12:12.560
But I broke her heart
because I didn't.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.330
I still don't.

12:32.780 --> 12:34.880
♪♪

12:48.660 --> 12:51.030
You're here because
it's feeding time?

12:52.730 --> 12:55.870
To watch the animals
in their cages?

12:55.870 --> 12:57.900
Ahmed's sleeping.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.670
Been sleeping a lot
 these days.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.910
I wanted to make sure
that you're being taken care of.

13:03.910 --> 13:06.610
Well, Aziz is looking after us,
as you can see.

13:11.490 --> 13:15.090
Why are we here?

13:15.090 --> 13:17.220
What crimes 
have we committed?

13:20.330 --> 13:21.530
We were allies,

13:21.530 --> 13:24.630
Bassam, you and I.

13:30.570 --> 13:33.670
If there are people
who are angry at our family,

13:33.680 --> 13:36.080
who want to
see someone punished,

13:36.080 --> 13:40.050
you can't let them take
their revenge out on me, Bassam.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.350
Or on my son.

13:42.350 --> 13:45.720
How is that going
to make anything better?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.820
If we die?

13:55.460 --> 13:59.170
You're not completely
in control here, are you?

14:10.880 --> 14:12.810
You're not eating.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.950
Are you upset?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.890
I'm sorry, what?

14:24.090 --> 14:26.090
(door thuds)

14:29.560 --> 14:31.970
Are you here for us?

14:31.970 --> 14:33.530
Yes.

14:33.530 --> 14:34.940
(screaming)

14:34.940 --> 14:37.500
(panting)

14:37.510 --> 14:38.970
(Molly) Honey?

14:38.970 --> 14:41.440
You okay?

14:41.440 --> 14:43.180
Yeah, yeah, just,
uh... just a dream.

14:43.180 --> 14:44.640
Sorry, didn't mean
to startle you.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.410
No, it's okay.

14:46.410 --> 14:47.750
Hey.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.850
You want to
tell me about it?

14:52.860 --> 14:56.520
- (Bassam panting)
- Where you going?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.360
To fix things.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.130
I'll arrange for
someone to drive you.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.300
No, just, uh...

15:04.300 --> 15:06.400
just get me a car.
I'll drive myself.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.670
Just a routine
inspection.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.740
It's all right, you
can leave us alone.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.740
(lock clicks)
(keys jingle)

15:26.490 --> 15:28.020
Don't.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.000
I know you loved me once.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.460
I'm sorry.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.070
(softly) Nusrat...

15:41.040 --> 15:44.340
No one comes to see me.

15:44.340 --> 15:46.510
Not even my husband.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.010
I need to talk to him.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.480
I... (sniffles)

15:49.480 --> 15:51.010
I need to explain.

15:51.010 --> 15:52.910
Does he hate me
 for what I did?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.980
He, uh...

15:57.020 --> 15:59.020
He loves you.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.550
Okay.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.160
Good. Well... (sniffles)

16:04.160 --> 16:06.430
Maybe they'll let me
see him soon.

16:08.060 --> 16:10.560
Jamal. Is he...

16:10.570 --> 16:12.830
No one knows if
he'll live or die.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.230
Bassam is President now.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.770
Well... (chuckles)

16:17.770 --> 16:20.610
at least
 I did some good.

16:20.610 --> 16:22.980
Yes.

16:24.910 --> 16:27.250
Are they going to
 execute me?

16:27.250 --> 16:30.750
Bassam wouldn't
let them do that.

16:30.750 --> 16:34.390
And you.

16:34.390 --> 16:37.420
You won't let them kill me,
will you?

16:37.430 --> 16:39.530
I, uh...

16:44.030 --> 16:47.570
Right.

16:47.570 --> 16:51.100
Y... You shot a president.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.080
I couldn't let them win.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.050
You understand that, right?

17:00.050 --> 17:03.050
Someone had to stop him.

17:03.050 --> 17:04.950
None of you could do it,

17:04.950 --> 17:07.520
so I had to do it for you.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.490
(Aziz) Are you okay,
 madame?

17:13.630 --> 17:16.800
I'm just...

17:16.800 --> 17:19.470
I'm having a bad day.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.740
May I arrange to have
the supper removed?

17:25.670 --> 17:28.310
I had them include
the cookies you like.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.780
Yes, I saw that.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.480
I know it doesn't
mean much.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.020
No, it means everything.

17:40.290 --> 17:43.190
You've always
looked after me, Aziz.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.430
You above all others, 
madame.

17:48.430 --> 17:51.000
Always. Till the end.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.440
(Daliyah) <i> It's nearly midnight.</i>

17:59.440 --> 18:01.840
You scared me.

18:01.840 --> 18:05.750
I wanted to come and see you
so many times before this.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.780
I know the rules.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.080
Just to talk.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.960
I need your advice.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.820
Okay.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.930
I'll make us some tea.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.830
(Barry)<i> I started thinking about</i>
<i> what they did</i>

18:26.830 --> 18:29.970
in Tunisia, in South Africa.

18:29.970 --> 18:32.740
That for this cycle to end,

18:32.740 --> 18:35.910
one of these days, the victims
will have to stop saying,

18:35.910 --> 18:38.980
"I want revenge,"
and just say...

18:38.980 --> 18:40.580
"I forgive."

18:40.580 --> 18:42.720
So you're just going
to let people go free?

18:42.720 --> 18:44.320
No punishment?

18:44.320 --> 18:46.490
No, no, I couldn't do that.
No one would understand.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.850
- I wouldn't understand.
- I'm talking about

18:48.860 --> 18:51.520
forming a
Truth and Dignity Commission.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.430
We all give testimony,

18:54.430 --> 18:56.730
the victims
and the victimizers,

18:56.730 --> 18:58.860
for all the crimes
we committed against each other,

18:58.870 --> 19:01.030
my father's, my brother's,
the Caliphate's.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.540
We go on record...

19:03.540 --> 19:06.570
to forgive and to heal.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.780
I think that's beautiful.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.120
(chuckles softly)

19:18.120 --> 19:19.450
You do?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.460
I really do.

19:26.690 --> 19:29.130
Why did you need
 to ask me?

19:29.130 --> 19:31.130
You should talk about this
with your wife,

19:31.130 --> 19:32.430
the First Lady.

19:32.430 --> 19:35.670
You came to Asima to play a part
in the new Abuddin.

19:35.670 --> 19:36.700
Isn't that what you said?

19:36.700 --> 19:38.200
- Yes.
- The commission

19:38.210 --> 19:40.210
will be led
by a five-person panel.

19:40.210 --> 19:42.880
I'm gonna name you
 the chair.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.980
(chuckles)

19:45.980 --> 19:47.680
That's not funny.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.920
I'm not the right choice,
Bassam.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.090
- I know nothing about government.
- Exactly.

19:57.090 --> 19:58.460
That is why you're perfect.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.230
You have no
 political interests.

20:00.230 --> 20:03.330
And you are
a national hero.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.870
The Mother of the Revolution.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.270
Haven't you read
any of these books?

20:06.270 --> 20:07.430
Oh, Bassam.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.670
You'll be fully independent.

20:08.670 --> 20:10.240
You can ask
any question you like.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.270
Call any witness.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.170
You can investigate anything.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.270
Even me.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
(chuckles softly)

20:16.280 --> 20:19.110
I don't like this.

20:19.110 --> 20:22.210
- I don't.
- (Bassam sighs)

20:22.620 --> 20:24.820
It makes me afraid.

20:24.820 --> 20:28.190
I trust you.

20:28.190 --> 20:31.690
I don't trust anyone else
the way that I trust you.

20:37.330 --> 20:39.930
And I'm the President.

20:39.930 --> 20:42.070
Are you gonna say no to me?

20:43.910 --> 20:49.040
These are enemies of the State.
You can't just...

20:49.040 --> 20:53.450
W... With all due respect,
this is crazy.

20:53.450 --> 20:56.450
Be careful
how you address me, Colonel.

20:56.450 --> 20:57.950
What will you do
about Jamal?

20:57.950 --> 20:59.620
He's still in a coma.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.890
Even if he lives,
he'll be paralyzed and frail.

21:01.890 --> 21:05.360
We can keep him under a soft
house arrest, a convalescence.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.660
And let the country
watch him reform publicly.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.260
Better that
than putting him on trial

21:09.260 --> 21:11.230
and turning him into a lightning
rod for his supporters.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.470
(Barry) Exactly.

21:12.470 --> 21:14.300
And Nusrat?

21:14.300 --> 21:16.240
We'll place her in
a mental institution for a time,

21:16.240 --> 21:17.470
and then release her.

21:17.470 --> 21:19.410
She cannot be
the only person punished

21:19.410 --> 21:21.910
for 25 years of crimes
in this country.

21:21.910 --> 21:24.210
That could set
a very dangerous precedent.

21:24.210 --> 21:26.610
Shoot a president
on national television,

21:26.610 --> 21:27.680
and then walk away.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.320
If I released her alone, yes.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.890
But after six months
and under a general amnesty,

21:31.890 --> 21:32.720
I think we can manage it.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.320
(Siddiq) And
 what about Ihab?

21:34.320 --> 21:36.320
You can't do this
to the people of Ma'an.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.220
Ihab will be transferred
to a new jurisdiction

21:38.230 --> 21:39.760
prior to the amnesty.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.260
I'm negotiating with
the Buhaira government,

21:41.260 --> 21:42.730
with the help of
the Arab League,

21:42.730 --> 21:44.030
to take him off our hands.

21:44.030 --> 21:45.000
Without consulting us first?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
You can either have
my back on this,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.770
or you can have
 my resignation.

22:01.220 --> 22:04.450
Of course he's late.
He was always late.

22:04.450 --> 22:06.550
(chuckles) He was always late.

22:06.550 --> 22:07.890
"Don't wait for your father."

22:07.890 --> 22:09.390
"The pancakes will get cold."

22:09.390 --> 22:10.620
"He's on the phone."

22:10.630 --> 22:11.860
"With a patient."

22:11.860 --> 22:13.260
(Sammy) Mm-hmm.

22:13.260 --> 22:14.590
(Molly chuckles)

22:14.600 --> 22:16.160
- What?
- (Molly) Nothing.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.730
We were just
reminiscing.

22:17.730 --> 22:19.130
How's the speech coming?

22:19.130 --> 22:21.100
Up all night. Almost done.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.700
Good.

22:22.700 --> 22:23.900
So, what are we

22:23.910 --> 22:25.470
reminiscing about?

22:25.470 --> 22:27.710
About our old
family breakfasts.

22:27.710 --> 22:30.740
"What are you afraid of,
 Emma?"

22:30.750 --> 22:33.150
What?

22:33.150 --> 22:34.650
"If you say
what you're afraid of,

22:34.650 --> 22:36.080
if we talk about it,

22:36.080 --> 22:37.550
it won't be so scary."

22:37.550 --> 22:40.490
I can't believe that worked.

22:40.490 --> 22:41.490
(chuckles softly)

22:41.490 --> 22:43.920
(Emma laughs)

22:43.930 --> 22:45.760
Mom?

22:45.760 --> 22:48.260
(voice breaking) What?

22:48.260 --> 22:49.460
- (Molly chuckles)
- Mom, don't...

22:49.460 --> 22:51.100
I know. It just...

22:51.100 --> 22:52.930
How many more mornings
are we gonna have like this,

22:52.930 --> 22:55.000
with everyone around
the table together? (sniffles)

22:55.000 --> 22:58.440
If you guys don't
get it, okay, you won't

22:58.440 --> 22:59.940
until you have kids,
but if I could just

22:59.940 --> 23:01.510
freeze time right now...

23:01.510 --> 23:05.140
All right, drama queen.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.610
I just want to say that
16 months ago,

23:07.610 --> 23:08.880
we were
 an ordinary family

23:08.880 --> 23:10.250
from Pasadena,

23:10.250 --> 23:12.080
and now
look where we are,

23:12.090 --> 23:14.320
what we've
accomplished.

23:14.320 --> 23:17.190
Not so bad, 
where life takes us.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.330
Well?

23:21.330 --> 23:22.760
Nice.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.100
Nice?

23:24.100 --> 23:25.600
Can I get
 a little support here?

23:25.600 --> 23:27.430
I'm going to the Palace today.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.270
It doesn't matter how you
look when you're famous.

23:30.270 --> 23:31.800
I'm not famous.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.010
You're famous in this book.

23:34.010 --> 23:36.880
It says you're
the Mother of the Revolution.

23:37.810 --> 23:40.850
"Khalil and the Red Hand."

23:40.850 --> 23:42.820
People actually read this?

23:42.820 --> 23:45.350
Everybody's reading it.

23:45.350 --> 23:48.020
Well, they should know
it's all exaggerated.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.360
To sell copies.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.960
The pictures make it look like
you want to kiss him.

23:59.030 --> 24:01.300
It shows us kissing?

24:01.300 --> 24:02.870
No, it just...

24:02.870 --> 24:05.670
looks like you want to.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.710
To sell copies.

24:07.710 --> 24:10.380
Abu Omar is the one
who took you, right?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.450
Did you hate him?

24:15.380 --> 24:17.450
At first.

24:19.420 --> 24:22.020
And then
I felt sorry for him.

24:22.020 --> 24:23.560
It shows him
looking for something

24:23.560 --> 24:25.520
you hid under
your clothes.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.830
Allah, this is
not a good book.

24:27.930 --> 24:29.730
(book thuds)

24:29.730 --> 24:32.730
♪♪

24:36.240 --> 24:38.670
You know, I've, uh...

24:38.670 --> 24:40.740
I've never made out
with a famous person before.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.840
- (chuckles) I'm not famous.
- Ah, come on.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.780
You were invited to the Palace
for the President's speech.

24:44.780 --> 24:46.710
That's famous enough for me.

24:46.710 --> 24:48.350
It's good to know
what you like about me.

24:48.350 --> 24:49.950
That's not what
I like about you.

24:49.950 --> 24:52.890
And I could not care less
about politics, but...

24:52.890 --> 24:56.090
I like other aspects of you,

24:56.090 --> 24:58.220
and I'm happy
to talk about those.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.360
Don't be an asshole.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.130
How can you not care
about politics?

25:02.130 --> 25:04.100
This is a huge speech.

25:05.970 --> 25:08.570
I think he's going to announce
plans for a real election.

25:08.570 --> 25:10.040
(sighs)

25:10.040 --> 25:12.200
Oh, from the Red Hand
to the Blue Finger.

25:13.910 --> 25:17.080
You know, the ink that proves
you voted in an election.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.610
Blue finger.

25:18.610 --> 25:21.610
I like that.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.380
Blue Finger.

25:23.380 --> 25:24.780
We could use that.

25:24.790 --> 25:27.620
(chuckles) What... 
What just happened?

25:27.620 --> 25:30.120
You talked politics
 by accident.

25:33.790 --> 25:37.530
(Barry)<i> Today will be known</i>
<i>as National Reconciliation Day.</i>

25:37.530 --> 25:39.330
<i> Why?</i>

25:39.330 --> 25:42.170
Because it's not enough
just to call an election

25:42.170 --> 25:43.600
six months from now.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.640
Experiments in democracy
fail all the time.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.910
We can't plan a better future
for ourselves

25:49.910 --> 25:53.250
until we come to terms
with our failed past.

25:53.250 --> 25:55.610
We still live side by side.

25:55.620 --> 25:58.620
Fundamentalists and secularists.

25:58.620 --> 26:02.590
Supporters of the old regime
and supporters of the new.

26:02.590 --> 26:04.990
(over radio) Now, 
we can avenge wrongs,

26:04.990 --> 26:08.030
seek revenge
against our enemies,

26:08.030 --> 26:11.030
but history is pretty clear
on one thing:

26:11.030 --> 26:14.200
that one day
those enemies will return

26:14.200 --> 26:16.840
to seek revenge on us.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.210
The Koran teaches us,
"Repel evil with good,

26:20.210 --> 26:21.610
and he who was your enemy

26:21.610 --> 26:24.610
may become your dearest friend."

26:24.610 --> 26:26.150
And so I am establishing

26:26.150 --> 26:28.880
a Truth and 
Dignity Commission,

26:28.880 --> 26:31.480
and with it,
the promise of healing

26:31.490 --> 26:33.190
instead of retribution.

26:33.190 --> 26:34.990
Reconciliation...

26:34.990 --> 26:37.390
rather than revenge.

26:37.390 --> 26:40.330
I've asked 
Daliyah Al-Yazbek,

26:40.330 --> 26:42.330
one of the heroes
of the revolution,

26:42.330 --> 26:44.630
to chair
 the five-person panel

26:44.630 --> 26:46.630
charged with hearing
the testimony

26:46.630 --> 26:48.130
and telling the story

26:48.140 --> 26:50.700
of our crimes
against each other.

26:53.470 --> 26:54.910
(camera shutters clicking)

26:58.910 --> 27:00.980
Mr. President, thank you.

27:06.820 --> 27:10.660
I am a Bedouin woman

27:10.660 --> 27:12.660
from a village...

27:12.660 --> 27:15.130
that no longer exists.

27:17.570 --> 27:20.070
A widow

27:20.070 --> 27:23.940
in a family
where two of three sons

27:23.940 --> 27:25.600
are now gone.

27:25.610 --> 27:28.840
A citizen

27:28.840 --> 27:30.440
in this nation

27:30.440 --> 27:32.950
of suffering.

27:32.950 --> 27:35.350
<i> We must look</i>
<i> each other in the eye</i>

27:35.350 --> 27:37.350
<i> and tell each other</i>
<i> our stories.</i>

27:37.350 --> 27:39.450
By orders of
the president.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.420
Send him my thanks.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.490
He's also instructed me
to tell you that you are

27:46.490 --> 27:49.190
invited to the first meeting
of the Election Committee.

27:51.530 --> 27:54.030
Then I will see you
at the conference table.

27:56.070 --> 27:59.170
All of us
 must give testimony

27:59.170 --> 28:01.270
for the story
 to be complete.

28:01.280 --> 28:05.080
And no one will be
granted amnesty

28:05.080 --> 28:09.250
until they give full witness
to their own crimes.

28:09.250 --> 28:12.150
(Maloof) The President would like
to see you later this evening.

28:14.490 --> 28:16.290
I forgive you, Colonel.

28:16.290 --> 28:18.190
Isn't that the style
of the moment?

28:18.190 --> 28:19.590
Where is Nusrat?

28:19.590 --> 28:21.000
Has she been released?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.060
She's been transferred
for a period of time

28:24.060 --> 28:25.470
to a mental institution.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.800
Well, I need to see my wife.

28:32.470 --> 28:35.770
(Daliyah)<i> Not so much
 forgiveness</i>

28:35.780 --> 28:38.080
<i> as a coming to terms.</i>

28:38.080 --> 28:41.910
Send me away
 as far as you want.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.980
You can shove forgiveness
up your ass.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.960
You think that you are
the hero here, hmm?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.690
You call elections.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.760
Those were my elections.

28:54.760 --> 28:58.160
One year ago,
I was going to be president.

28:58.170 --> 29:02.000
You, your family took
everything I ever had.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.470
We are not nearly done

29:07.470 --> 29:09.240
with each other,
Al Fayeed.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.240
(footsteps departing)

29:15.150 --> 29:16.150
(Daliyah)<i> And that,</i>

29:16.150 --> 29:18.950
we pray,

29:18.950 --> 29:21.620
in time...

29:21.620 --> 29:23.860
will set us free.

29:26.530 --> 29:27.490
(gasps)

29:27.490 --> 29:29.060
Wake up.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.460
What's happening?

29:30.460 --> 29:32.030
What are you doing?
What's happening?

29:32.030 --> 29:33.270
I want to see Ahmed!

29:33.270 --> 29:35.070
No, no, no!

29:35.070 --> 29:36.470
I want to see my husband!

29:36.470 --> 29:38.240
I want to see Ahmed!

29:38.240 --> 29:39.740
No, please don't do this.
Please.

29:39.740 --> 29:41.010
Bassam wouldn't do this.

29:41.010 --> 29:42.210
I don't understand.

29:42.210 --> 29:43.410
Please, please.

29:43.410 --> 29:44.840
No, stop!

29:44.850 --> 29:46.250
Stop!

29:46.250 --> 29:47.850
Get off me!

29:47.850 --> 29:49.210
(shouts)

29:49.220 --> 29:51.250
Stop it, please!

29:51.250 --> 29:53.250
Somebody help me!

29:53.250 --> 29:54.690
Somebody!

29:54.690 --> 29:56.490
Somebody help me!

29:56.490 --> 29:57.660
(grunts)

29:57.660 --> 29:59.120
(choking)

30:15.520 --> 30:18.120
(cell door slams)
(sound echoes)

30:24.180 --> 30:27.550
So, that's Daliyah.

30:27.550 --> 30:30.960
Famous Daliyah
who saved your life.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.930
She's not how I pictured her.

30:32.930 --> 30:36.730
(chuckles) Really?
How did you picture her?

30:36.730 --> 30:39.560
Uh, I don't know.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.070
Desert-worn?

30:41.070 --> 30:44.240
(chuckles)

30:44.240 --> 30:46.240
I didn't know
she was in the capital.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.210
You never said.

30:48.210 --> 30:50.880
Yeah, for a while now.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.820
She's an unlikely choice
for that position.

30:58.820 --> 31:02.250
Don't you think?

31:02.260 --> 31:05.260
Yes, very.

31:05.260 --> 31:06.830
But...

31:06.830 --> 31:09.330
people love her.

31:09.330 --> 31:13.270
I guess war makes
unlikely heroes.

31:13.270 --> 31:16.300
I think she's the perfect
person for the job.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.270
Dinner, after I
meet with Leila?

31:22.280 --> 31:23.680
Mm, sure.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.740
Okay.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.820
(door clicks)

31:30.820 --> 31:33.450
(Barry)<i> You don't waste much time</i>
<i> on thank-yous, do you?</i>

31:33.450 --> 31:35.820
You're looking for gratitude?

31:35.820 --> 31:38.320
I'm sorry
 I've disappointed you.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.630
Though I do admire
your courage.

31:41.630 --> 31:44.400
Still, this experiment of yours

31:44.400 --> 31:47.600
doesn't work without my blessing
and participation.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.900
I'm going to inherit
my husband's support

31:49.900 --> 31:51.470
without even asking.

31:51.470 --> 31:55.340
That's 25% of the country,
at least.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.990
That's exactly why I expect
you'll work with me

31:57.990 --> 32:00.050
towards this election...
Self-interest.

32:00.050 --> 32:02.050
Naturally.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.620
Ahmed wants to follow
in his father's footsteps.

32:04.620 --> 32:07.450
(scoffs) Who wouldn't?

32:07.450 --> 32:11.120
In the meantime, what position
do I have in your cabinet?

32:11.130 --> 32:13.190
Or were you just

32:13.190 --> 32:16.030
playing lip service
to a coalition government?

32:16.030 --> 32:18.000
What are you looking for?

32:18.000 --> 32:22.400
I lived on the sidelines
for 20 years, Bassam.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.840
Watching and nodding while
other people made mistakes.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.210
I want to be foreign secretary,

32:28.210 --> 32:31.640
the first woman Foreign
Secretary of an Arab nation.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.650
Okay.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.650
That's what you'll be.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.650
(knocking on door)

32:42.860 --> 32:45.120
I'm sorry,
Mr. President, madame.

32:50.430 --> 32:52.300
(sobs)

32:55.570 --> 32:57.270
(sniffles)

32:57.270 --> 32:59.770
Did she leave a note?

32:59.770 --> 33:02.470
I don't think so.

33:05.410 --> 33:09.250
I'm sure she couldn't,
locked in her cell.

33:22.030 --> 33:23.430
There you are.

33:23.430 --> 33:24.730
General.

33:24.730 --> 33:26.200
Not now, Colonel.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.300
You have a meeting.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.370
I said not now!

33:38.480 --> 33:41.280
(Aziz) Is there anything
I can do for you, madame?

33:41.280 --> 33:43.380
Anything else?

33:51.060 --> 33:53.560
Did she really
 commit suicide?

33:57.970 --> 33:59.970
I never asked you.

33:59.970 --> 34:01.970
(Aziz) Of course not.

34:01.970 --> 34:04.840
It's my job to anticipate.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.739
Your son was in
an impossible position.

34:20.190 --> 34:23.090
I tried to kill him 
myself once.

34:23.090 --> 34:25.219
My husband.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.260
I couldn't.

34:43.110 --> 34:46.179
(door opens and closes)

34:58.330 --> 35:00.360
So what does the Arabic say?

35:00.360 --> 35:03.330
"This time,
we choose."

35:03.330 --> 35:05.730
Blue finger.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.730
Red Hand to Blue Finger.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.730
Clever.

35:09.740 --> 35:13.410
This election
is like a dream.

35:13.410 --> 35:15.810
I'm just not sure about this
"turn the other cheek" thing.

35:15.810 --> 35:18.210
Don't say anything
to your dad.

35:18.210 --> 35:20.250
I mean, I'm
still angry.

35:20.250 --> 35:23.550
I don't know. Can you
pretend to forgive?

35:23.550 --> 35:26.250
You don't pretend.

35:26.250 --> 35:29.320
You force yourself
until it becomes the truth.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.260
Right.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.330
I'll try.

35:37.030 --> 35:39.760
You say you
want democracy.

35:39.770 --> 35:42.230
Then shouldn't democracy
begin at this table?

35:42.240 --> 35:43.870
And yet you've
already announced

35:43.870 --> 35:46.070
the election's in
six months away.

35:46.070 --> 35:48.040
Why six months?

35:48.040 --> 35:51.040
That's the soonest
I think we can be ready.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.950
I'm not sure these gentlemen
want it to be the soonest.

35:53.950 --> 35:55.350
That's good for
the front-runner.

35:55.350 --> 35:57.180
That's good for you,
Mr. President.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.850
It's not good for
the rest of us.

35:58.850 --> 36:00.620
You're lucky you're even
being allowed to run.

36:00.620 --> 36:04.960
You offered us all positions
in your government.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.030
You have a problem
with that, too?

36:07.030 --> 36:08.730
Patience, General.

36:08.730 --> 36:10.900
By accepting
those positions

36:10.900 --> 36:11.770
in your government,

36:11.770 --> 36:13.930
we give tacit support
to your policies.

36:13.930 --> 36:15.700
We have nothing
to run against.

36:15.700 --> 36:18.270
When we run against you,
we run against ourselves.

36:18.270 --> 36:19.870
He's right.
As it is,

36:19.870 --> 36:22.670
polling says that if
the elections were held today,

36:22.670 --> 36:24.540
you would get
72% of the vote.

36:24.540 --> 36:26.980
It won't be an election.

36:26.980 --> 36:30.380
It... It would be
a coronation, of you.

36:31.050 --> 36:33.790
Tell us why
we should support that.

36:33.790 --> 36:36.550
Because I'm not running.

36:39.660 --> 36:43.130
I'm not running for president.

36:43.130 --> 36:47.170
Whatever you do,
you do it for yourselves.

36:57.940 --> 36:59.540
This is not
an open question.

36:59.540 --> 37:00.580
There's nothing
to discuss.

37:00.580 --> 37:01.980
You might at least
have given a heads up

37:01.980 --> 37:03.180
to your principal ally.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.450
So you could do what?

37:04.450 --> 37:05.990
Was this your
plan all along...

37:05.990 --> 37:07.520
to drop out of
the election?

37:07.520 --> 37:09.320
Then why didn't you say so
before you took office?

37:09.320 --> 37:11.620
Because <i> then</i> the country
needed reassurance.

37:11.620 --> 37:12.960
<i> Now</i> it needs
 a real election.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.630
And that cannot happen if I run.

37:14.630 --> 37:16.360
I'm afraid for
your country, Bassam.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.360
Me, too.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.260
Every day.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.630
But here's the real question.

37:20.630 --> 37:23.030
Are you truly committed
to democracy in Abuddin,

37:23.040 --> 37:24.870
whatever outcome
it produces?

37:24.870 --> 37:27.240
Or will America be seen
by the whole world

37:27.240 --> 37:29.670
as only having
 supported me?

37:50.530 --> 37:52.600
You seem nervous.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.570
You're the First Lady
of Abuddin.

37:56.570 --> 38:00.070
And you're the head of the
Truth and Dignity Commission.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.910
To be honest, none of this
seems real to me.

38:05.910 --> 38:08.350
I'm a doctor from Pasadena.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.850
Tell me about it.

38:09.850 --> 38:12.080
Daliyah, I...

38:12.090 --> 38:15.550
owe you a lot, I think.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.460
My husband's life,
I hear, for starters.

38:19.430 --> 38:21.260
No, please.

38:21.260 --> 38:23.160
Don't be modest.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.030
Listen,
 to tell you the truth,

38:28.030 --> 38:30.000
I wish you would tell me
all about it.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.240
Barry won't.

38:31.240 --> 38:34.670
He keeps everything
locked up inside.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.110
It was a painful time.

38:37.110 --> 38:39.510
I know.

38:39.510 --> 38:42.750
And my husband

38:42.750 --> 38:44.720
is quite private,

38:44.720 --> 38:47.650
even in the best of times.

38:49.220 --> 38:52.090
I met him as Khalil.

38:52.090 --> 38:54.160
I know what you mean.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.430
He's told me almost nothing
about you.

38:59.430 --> 39:02.430
I'm not all that important.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.240
Just a small part
in his story.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.700
I doubt that.

39:05.710 --> 39:09.240
He obviously thinks
very highly of you.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.110
And now we share

39:12.110 --> 39:15.150
in this job of
taking care of Abuddin.

39:17.150 --> 39:20.050
We share many things.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.960
So I wanted to meet you.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.830
I'm honored.

39:40.830 --> 39:42.830
(Ahmed sighs)

39:45.780 --> 39:48.080
You okay?

39:48.080 --> 39:50.080
I'm in mourning
for my wife.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.690
You, on the other hand,
seem to be moving on nicely.

39:53.690 --> 39:55.450
Don't do that.
I'm in mourning, too.

39:55.460 --> 39:58.160
And the work for the government
doesn't stop, Ahmed.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.620
So I hear.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.130
You've been made
Foreign Secretary?

40:02.130 --> 40:04.200
Yes. That's very good
news for us.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.930
"For us"?

40:06.930 --> 40:09.430
How does that help me
run for president?

40:09.440 --> 40:13.370
Ahmed, you're in mourning
for your wife.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.170
This is no time to be
thinking about elections.

40:15.170 --> 40:17.840
Nusrat died to make this
possible for me.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.210
That's all I'm going to be
thinking about.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.520
It's too soon.

40:29.790 --> 40:32.560
What?

40:32.560 --> 40:34.560
What does that mean?

40:34.560 --> 40:36.230
If the office had been
handed to you,

40:36.230 --> 40:38.960
if all this had happened
a few years from now,

40:38.970 --> 40:41.600
after Bassam's administration,
that would have been one thing.

40:43.470 --> 40:46.040
But right now you're in no
position to run for president.

40:46.040 --> 40:49.310
You're just not
hard enough yet.

40:49.310 --> 40:50.680
Takes time to develop calluses.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.440
That's not a bad thing.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.080
You're going to run yourself.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.880
I'm keeping a place for you.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.880
Just as your father
would have done.

40:59.890 --> 41:01.760
You need time.
I'm buying you time.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.020
Bullshit!

41:03.020 --> 41:05.160
You crave power.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.160
You don't even think
about it anymore.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.660
- It's a reflex...
- Yes, it is!

41:08.660 --> 41:11.500
It's instinct!

41:11.500 --> 41:14.500
That's what I've known
my whole life.

41:14.500 --> 41:17.500
The will to power.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.240
That's how I've survived, 
Ahmed.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.710
Well, at least
we've acknowledged it.

41:21.710 --> 41:23.410
You're in this for you.

41:27.410 --> 41:29.620
There is no difference
between what I do for myself

41:29.620 --> 41:31.080
and what I do for you.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.790
I'm strong to
take care of you.

41:33.790 --> 41:35.590
But you know
what's funny?

41:35.590 --> 41:38.360
That I should even
have to answer that.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.220
Like it's some kind
 of a crime

41:40.230 --> 41:42.060
for a woman
to think about herself.

41:42.060 --> 41:44.160
This is for
both of us.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.600
You are my son
and I love you,

41:45.600 --> 41:48.230
but I'm tired for apologizing
of sometimes thinking

41:48.230 --> 41:51.340
that I might be more
than a wife and a mother.

41:56.540 --> 41:57.980
It's like <i> "King Lear."</i>

41:57.980 --> 42:00.780
They'll all fight
for your kingdom now.

42:00.780 --> 42:03.210
I know.

42:03.220 --> 42:06.620
But it was always more
theirs than it was mine.

42:06.620 --> 42:10.050
And at least now everyone
has a stake in it.

42:10.060 --> 42:12.960
And I can sleep
a little easier.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.730
Soon I'll be an
ordinary man.

42:15.730 --> 42:16.730
No more power.

42:16.730 --> 42:18.970
Right. Yeah.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.730
Much better,
it turns out.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.970
But for a while,

42:23.970 --> 42:26.570
we are the First Family
of Abuddin.

42:26.570 --> 42:27.970
Yes, we are.

42:27.970 --> 42:30.010
I'm proud of that.

42:35.580 --> 42:37.680
Barry...

42:40.020 --> 42:42.090
do you still love me?

42:46.430 --> 42:48.490
You know the answer to that.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.460
Mm-hmm.

42:51.460 --> 42:55.400
Are you still...
in love with me?

42:57.540 --> 42:59.500
(short chuckle)

42:59.510 --> 43:01.540
Yes.

43:01.540 --> 43:05.540
Why would you
ask me that now?

43:05.550 --> 43:07.650
I don't know.

43:07.650 --> 43:09.010
Never mind.

43:09.020 --> 43:12.020
Hey.

43:12.020 --> 43:14.550
It's you and me.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.290
You know that.

43:18.220 --> 43:21.330
You're right, I know that.

43:21.330 --> 43:24.360
(phone rings)

43:24.360 --> 43:26.430
Aziz.

43:30.370 --> 43:32.440
My brother.

43:37.580 --> 43:40.680
(Doctor) He woke up from the coma
about an hour ago.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.680
He's not communicating yet,
but he does

43:42.680 --> 43:44.480
respond to stimuli.

43:44.480 --> 43:46.520
Your brother's not
out of the woods, of course,

43:46.520 --> 43:50.090
but if I were a betting man,
I'd give him decent odds.

43:50.090 --> 43:52.220
Thank you, Doctor.

44:22.060 --> 44:25.460
I've been
praying for this.

44:25.460 --> 44:27.960
But between you and me...

44:29.930 --> 44:32.000
it might have been easier...

44:33.900 --> 44:36.000
my brother...

44:38.940 --> 44:41.010
if you had died.

44:50.250 --> 44:51.420
Welcome.

44:51.420 --> 44:52.950
<i> Marhaba.</i>

44:52.950 --> 44:55.960
You've asked to see me,
Mr. Ambassador? Please.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.020
Out of respect,
Madam Foreign Secretary.

45:01.660 --> 45:04.530
There has been a change
in my government's position

45:04.530 --> 45:06.700
with regards to Ihab bin Rashid.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.600
Tell the President
to join us immediately.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.270
(woman) Right away.

45:12.270 --> 45:14.570
What does that mean, 
exactly?

45:14.570 --> 45:16.340
The Caliphate has
threatened to execute

45:16.340 --> 45:18.510
25 of our nationals
in its custody

45:18.510 --> 45:20.280
if we do not release
our prisoner.

45:20.280 --> 45:23.080
I understand.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.520
Let us arrange to have him

45:24.520 --> 45:26.780
returned to our control.

45:26.790 --> 45:28.890
I'm afraid
 it's not that simple.

45:38.700 --> 45:40.830
(shouts)

45:49.110 --> 45:51.840
(Barry)<i> So bin Rashid
 is already gone?</i>

45:59.150 --> 46:01.550
I'm sending you home,
Mr. Ambassador,

46:01.550 --> 46:03.960
with a letter of protest
to your government.

46:03.960 --> 46:06.390
As you wish.

46:06.390 --> 46:08.360
It would be unfortunate
if it comes out

46:08.360 --> 46:11.360
that you've accepted bin Rashid
as a bargaining chip

46:11.360 --> 46:14.030
to negotiate the release
of your own nationals.

46:14.030 --> 46:15.700
You are new at this.

46:15.700 --> 46:18.340
I will take it this is a
mistake of inexperience,

46:18.340 --> 46:20.550
not an accusation
against an ally

46:20.550 --> 46:22.540
that you wish
to turn into an enemy.

46:22.540 --> 46:25.310
As you wish.

46:31.990 --> 46:33.990
(door opens)

46:33.990 --> 46:36.050
(door closes)

46:38.320 --> 46:41.190
I made a mistake.

46:41.190 --> 46:44.260
(violin playing gentle music)

47:08.550 --> 47:10.590
Gentlemen!

47:10.590 --> 47:12.160
We're almost there.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.090
Let's buckle up!

47:14.090 --> 47:16.090
(soldiers murmuring)

47:18.770 --> 47:20.730
- General.
- Exley.

47:20.730 --> 47:22.130
Welcome back, sir.

47:22.140 --> 47:24.400
Am I too late?

47:24.400 --> 47:26.000
We'll see.

47:40.320 --> 47:42.390
Welcome home.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.760
Caliph.

47:46.760 --> 47:48.830
I'm in your debt.

47:52.270 --> 47:54.670
Keeping my eye on you.

47:54.670 --> 47:56.730
Had Bassam not
done us the favor,

47:56.740 --> 48:00.100
we might have had to get you
out of prison by ourselves.

48:00.110 --> 48:02.040
I'm honored.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.410
I have my selfish reason.

48:05.410 --> 48:07.650
Syria is coming apart
by the seams.

48:07.650 --> 48:09.610
We're under
pressure here.

48:09.610 --> 48:10.850
We need a new home.

48:10.850 --> 48:13.580
The fact that the American
has taken power in Abuddin

48:13.590 --> 48:16.390
is an opportunity
almost too good to be true

48:16.390 --> 48:17.820
if we play it right.

48:17.820 --> 48:21.690
So... use me.

48:21.690 --> 48:24.460
Bassam has my country

48:24.460 --> 48:26.130
operating under
 the assumption

48:26.130 --> 48:29.000
that we can all
forgive each other.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.770
I'm never going to forgive.

48:32.770 --> 48:34.940
He and his whole family

48:34.940 --> 48:38.140
<i> are going to wish</i>
<i> that he had just let me die.</i>

48:38.140 --> 48:41.150
I have a meeting with
the Egyptian Foreign Minister.

48:41.150 --> 48:43.550
What's everyone else
up to?

48:44.650 --> 48:46.320
What are you afraid of,
 Emma?

48:46.320 --> 48:47.320
(both chuckle)

48:47.320 --> 48:49.520
