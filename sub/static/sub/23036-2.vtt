WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.943
[cheering]

00:11.011 --> 00:12.912
[cheering continues]

00:13.380 --> 00:15.715
-[Chris] Oh, she cut her arm open.
-[audience groans]

00:16.049 --> 00:17.350
[Chris] That is a serious gash.

00:17.417 --> 00:20.053
-Did you see how big that gash is?
-[gasps]

00:20.987 --> 00:23.089
[Chris] She can't feel her arm right now.

00:25.658 --> 00:27.594
For my entire life,
since I was eight years old,

00:27.660 --> 00:28.661
all I did was gymnastics.

00:28.728 --> 00:32.832
My background in gymnastics and parkour
makes me a great stunt performer,

00:32.899 --> 00:35.335
because I know my body so well.

00:35.835 --> 00:38.171
Learning how to drive cars,
getting lit on fire...

00:38.238 --> 00:40.106
I think I just like adrenaline.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.642
No matter how big the Beast is,

00:42.709 --> 00:45.111
nobody's going to stop me
from winning this competition.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.379
I'm gonna kill it!

00:46.446 --> 00:48.214
Boom, son! You heard!

00:48.281 --> 00:49.983
[cheering]

00:50.050 --> 00:51.985
[Chris]
She's rubbing blood all over her face!

00:52.052 --> 00:53.186
[cheering]

00:54.054 --> 00:54.988
I'm gonna throw up!

00:55.055 --> 00:57.090
Wow,
is she going to go for it right here?

00:57.157 --> 00:58.691
[Tiki] Can't hold a good woman down!

00:59.959 --> 01:01.027
[theme music playing]

01:08.568 --> 01:10.570
[cheering]

01:12.872 --> 01:15.008
[Chris] Doesn't matter how many times
you see that,

01:15.075 --> 01:16.709
it doesn't get less intimidating.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.344
[Tiki] How much steel is in there?

01:18.411 --> 01:20.246
-[Chris] All of it.
-[Tiki] All in the world?

01:20.313 --> 01:23.149
Yes. It's the whole city
of Pittsburgh steel in it.

01:23.450 --> 01:27.220
Hello, everyone. I'm Tiki Barber,
and with me is Chris Distefano.

01:27.287 --> 01:30.523
Welcome back to another round
of Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.092
At this very moment,

01:32.158 --> 01:34.360
12 new, unbelievable athletes

01:34.427 --> 01:38.131
are waiting for a chance
to go inside the belly of the Beast

01:38.198 --> 01:40.633
for tonight's $10,000 prize

01:40.700 --> 01:44.571
and the chance to become
a bona fide Beastmaster.

01:44.637 --> 01:48.374
Plus, the winners of all nine episodes
will compete on our final night

01:48.441 --> 01:50.910
for the title of Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:50.977 --> 01:53.480
It's gonna be a beast to get there.

01:53.546 --> 01:57.584
One athlete has advanced to the finals,
with just eight spots left.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.986
Tonight, who will claim number two?

02:02.055 --> 02:04.190
[Chris]
Meet the two Americans competing tonight.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.893
Gabe Baker is an engineer
and former football star,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.195
with the brains and brawn
to beast the Beast.

02:09.262 --> 02:10.864
[Gabe] In football, I played safety.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.233
The role of a safety
is to be the last line of defense.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.801
I mean, you have to be powerful.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.970
You have to be strong.
You have to be fast.

02:17.036 --> 02:20.273
And all of those attributes
are just what you need

02:20.340 --> 02:21.875
to attack the Beast.

02:22.275 --> 02:25.745
[Chris] Natalie Strasser
is a former gymnast and master of parkour.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.082
Tonight, she's out to prove why
that could be the winning combination.

02:29.415 --> 02:30.984
I think I just like adrenaline

02:31.050 --> 02:33.419
and basically pushing my own body
to its limits.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.955
I'm very good at manipulating
my own body weight.

02:36.022 --> 02:37.090
I'm very strong.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.593
I know that my small little package
has a lot of spunk.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.929
I know I'm gonna be able
to get over those obstacles.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.535
[Chris] Okay, here we go.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.373
[Tiki] Here's Level 1 by the numbers:

02:53.439 --> 02:55.775
six obstacles, three Point Thrusters,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.077
and 130 points up for grabs

02:58.144 --> 03:00.046
in a single six-minute run.

03:00.113 --> 03:03.416
But these 12 athletes
face a new set of obstacles.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.718
They'll have to leap
and grab the Sling Shot,

03:05.785 --> 03:08.421
then launch themselves
onto a series of Crash Pads

03:08.488 --> 03:10.823
to successfully
make their way through Level 1.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.760
This is a very, very tight competition.

03:13.826 --> 03:17.230
Now remember,
just eight of tonight's 12 competitors

03:17.297 --> 03:19.132
will advance to Level 2.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.338
All right, starting off
tonight's competition,

03:25.405 --> 03:29.342
here's a guy
who definitely wants a piece of the Beast.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.812
[Chris] Antonio Bosso grew up
in the hood back in Italy.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.949
But since finding parkour,
he's helped other at-risk kids.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.217
Flipped the script.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.021
[Antonio in Italian]
<span style="style_3"/>I used to hang out on the streets,

03:42.088 --> 03:47.260
but most of my friends ended up in jail,
dead or doing drugs.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.030
I came across parkour,

03:51.097 --> 03:52.265
and it saved me.

03:55.635 --> 03:58.238
I work in a social cooperative
called Iqbal's Carpet.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.608
We managed to bring
Save the Children to Barra.

04:01.674 --> 04:04.210
If I win, I'll go back to Naples

04:04.577 --> 04:06.879
and open a big gym in my area, Barra...

04:07.413 --> 04:08.448
for everyone.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.588
It's a mix between Antonio Bosso
and the Karate Kid.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.392
[Tiki] Out of Bite Force,
easily up on the Grinder.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.130
[Chris] Five-six.

04:24.731 --> 04:27.700
165 pounds,
so no problem on the Grinder here.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.702
[Tiki] Comfortably through the Grinder.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.871
[Chris] With 25 points. He's confident.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.874
[Tiki] The thing with the Faceplant -
it takes some core strength.

04:34.941 --> 04:39.178
If you don't squat, tighten your core,
you can easily fall off of this thing.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.750
-Oh!
-[Chris] Here we go!

04:43.816 --> 04:44.717
He's got to climb up.

04:44.784 --> 04:49.422
-Come on, Antonio!
-We have high hopes for you!

04:49.489 --> 04:50.323
[Chris] Nice!

04:50.390 --> 04:53.693
-[Tiki] It took effort, but he made it.
-[Chris] Nice! Good for you!

04:55.528 --> 04:57.930
-[Tiki] He's got 35 points at this point.
-[Chris] Yes.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.535
[shouting]

05:02.602 --> 05:04.570
-[Chris] Unfortunately...
-[Tiki] He had that!

05:04.637 --> 05:07.240
Our Italian counterparts
are breaking the...

05:07.307 --> 05:08.308
No, Francesco!

05:08.374 --> 05:10.209
-[Tiki] Don't do it!
-[Chris] Don't jump!

05:10.276 --> 05:11.544
I wanna jump!

05:11.611 --> 05:14.647
-[Francesco in English] I wanna do it!
-[in English] No, Francesco! No!

05:14.714 --> 05:15.982
Life is worth living!

05:16.049 --> 05:17.216
[in English] Jump! You, jump!

05:17.583 --> 05:19.118
-What? Don't talk--
-Hey!

05:19.619 --> 05:21.988
Mamma mia, mamma mia, Gilles!

05:23.256 --> 05:24.724
[Chris] All right, I see London.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.092
She's from France.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.462
Laura Mété teaches people to pole dance.

05:31.531 --> 05:34.634
[Laura in French] In 2007, when I was
preparing for the French championships,

05:34.701 --> 05:39.038
I landed badly after a vault
and hurt my knee.

05:39.105 --> 05:42.742
So, sadly,
that was the end of gymnastics for me.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.178
I needed a new sport.

05:45.244 --> 05:47.013
I did some research on the internet

05:47.080 --> 05:48.881
and came across a pole dancing video.

05:48.948 --> 05:50.450
I decided it's what I needed.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.251
I love teaching pole dancing,

05:52.318 --> 05:57.790
because I didn't feel pretty,
I didn't feel feminine,

05:57.857 --> 06:00.960
and pole dancing helped me
to discover my feminine side.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.229
If I can pass that feeling on

06:03.296 --> 06:05.264
to the young women
who come to my lessons,

06:05.331 --> 06:06.299
then I'm winning.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.334
That's my number one priority.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.540
[Tiki] She's up Bite Force,
onto the Grinder.

06:14.774 --> 06:18.044
Wow, she pulled up that chain
pretty deftly.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.245
[Chris] So for four years,

06:19.312 --> 06:22.682
Laura said she lacked self-esteem
and was very embarrassed of her body,

06:22.749 --> 06:24.884
and what got her over that
was pole dancing.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.419
Maybe I should do some of that.

06:26.486 --> 06:27.587
Oh!

06:27.653 --> 06:30.089
Come on, darling. You can do it!

06:30.156 --> 06:31.357
Go!

06:31.424 --> 06:33.493
[Tiki] One more to go.
One more jump to go.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.897
[Chris] Laura is getting through,
no problem.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.135
Okay.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.004
-Onto the Faceplant.
-[Tiki] Onto the Faceplant.

06:45.071 --> 06:45.905
[cheering]

06:45.972 --> 06:47.840
[Tiki] 25 points
she's sitting at right now.

06:47.907 --> 06:48.941
Well done!

06:53.613 --> 06:54.881
[Chris] Collecting herself.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.283
[Tiki] Control your breathing.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.119
Keep your core engaged. Grab this chain.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.992
-[in French] Perfect!
-[in French] Look at that!

07:06.058 --> 07:08.494
Where are all the men?
They need to see this!

07:08.828 --> 07:10.463
[Tiki] Let's see if she makes this jump.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.898
Use your arms!

07:12.298 --> 07:14.834
[Tiki] Trying to figure out
her dominant foot. This matters.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.003
You have to figure out
which is dominant.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.204
Come on, come on...

07:18.271 --> 07:19.739
Oh!

07:19.806 --> 07:21.707
-No, no, no!
-No!

07:22.241 --> 07:25.144
Beautiful Laura,
you were doing so well.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.381
[Chris] Laura Mété with 35 points.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.816
But, hey, valiant effort.

07:29.882 --> 07:30.850
Valiant effort.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.687
I don't know, but it was so far way.

07:35.354 --> 07:38.724
It felt like it was miles away,
that thing.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.259
Awful. Awful.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.863
I will beat you. I will.
I'll get my revenge.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.699
I'll be back, I hope. Fingers crossed.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.202
Whoo! [kisses]

07:53.639 --> 07:57.310
[Tiki] Next up, from China,
it's the world champion rock climber

07:57.376 --> 07:58.244
Haibin Qu.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.913
-[Chris] Wet shoe.
-[Tiki] You notice this technique.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.115
They spread their legs really wide

08:03.182 --> 08:05.551
to wedge yourself into that Faceplant,

08:05.618 --> 08:07.620
just in case your shoes are slippery.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.722
You want to make sure
your shoes are dry.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.224
Like, very, very dry.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.293
-[Chris] Oh, making it look easy!
-He got across.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.263
[Tiki] We have seen two competitors
get to the same point

08:17.330 --> 08:18.164
so far tonight.

08:18.764 --> 08:22.235
If he makes this jump,
he is in first place.

08:23.703 --> 08:26.906
-Oh, yes!
-[Chris] Haibin has made it to first.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.641
Two contestants couldn't do it.

08:28.708 --> 08:29.942
-Yes.
-But Haibin did.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.410
It's a good start.

08:31.477 --> 08:32.812
This is a turning point.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.515
[Chris] Okay, Haibin Qu,

08:35.982 --> 08:37.884
trying to get five more points.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.620
[Tiki] Using the same technique
that he used with the first.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.788
-This is a little longer.
-[Chris] He made it!

08:42.855 --> 08:45.892
-[Tiki] He just hangs on.
-[Chris] Haibin Qu just made it!

08:46.192 --> 08:47.493
[Tiki] Just hangs on.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.863
Watch this replay.
He lands squarely on his stomach.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.098
[Chris groans] That's a rib!

08:59.205 --> 09:01.941
[Tiki] Now, he passed up
the Point Thruster right there.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.577
But it's not going to matter,

09:04.644 --> 09:07.880
because he just became the first athlete
to reach Sling Shot.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.983
Can Haibin get high enough?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.923
[Chris] Oh, and he's onto the Sling Shot!

09:16.989 --> 09:20.693
[Tiki] This thing is called a Sling Shot
as it Sling Shots you after you let go,

09:20.760 --> 09:22.028
onto this Crash Pad.

09:22.094 --> 09:23.195
[Chris] Come on, Haibin!

09:23.262 --> 09:24.330
[Tiki] He's getting...

09:24.397 --> 09:25.231
[shouting]

09:25.298 --> 09:28.701
[Chris] Haibin! And he made it onto
the Crash Pad for another five points!

09:28.768 --> 09:30.469
-[Tiki] That was a...
-[Chris] China!

09:30.536 --> 09:31.671
[Tiki] ...a great landing.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.606
[Chris] You just had a crash landing,
China.

09:33.673 --> 09:34.540
The issue--

09:34.607 --> 09:35.541
[Chris and Tiki shout]

09:35.608 --> 09:37.977
[Chris] And then you fell
into the duck sauce.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.779
Haibin Qu!

09:40.212 --> 09:43.282
Great performance!
China, that was good! That was good.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.417
It's the best.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.485
-[in Chinese] Hello. Hello.
-Yes.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.553
[in Chinese] Hello.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.922
-[in English] That's just "hello."
-[in English] Oh, hello?

09:50.756 --> 09:53.659
[Tiki] He's got a lot
to be proud of, Haibin Qu.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.529
In the lead right now with 85 points.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.663
[Chris] Wow!

09:58.230 --> 10:01.233
Next up, we have Miguel Espada
from España.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.603
A parkour expert turned stuntman.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.104
Come on, Miguel! Come on!

10:05.171 --> 10:07.239
-Look at the Spanish guys cheering!
-Yes!

10:07.306 --> 10:09.575
The atmosphere is awesome!
Go! Come on!

10:10.309 --> 10:11.944
-Go, Miguel!
-So much adrenaline.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.380
-We're rooting for you!
-Well done, Miguel!

10:15.548 --> 10:17.416
[Tiki] 25 points if he hits the Faceplant.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.485
He'll spread his legs,
keep his balance.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.454
This is all about core on this Faceplant.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.590
[Spanish hosts singing]

10:24.657 --> 10:26.859
Come on, Miguel! You can do it!

10:27.727 --> 10:29.228
[Tiki] He jumps through easily.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.931
Off the chain and onto the Energy Coil.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.333
He's got a Point Thruster.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.203
Let's see if he can make this.
Yes, he makes it!

10:37.269 --> 10:38.204
[Chris] Just made it!

10:38.804 --> 10:41.874
[Tiki] This is a different route
than our previous competitor.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.410
Usually you have to use your foot...

10:44.477 --> 10:46.912
-[Chris] Kick it!
-[Tiki] He gets the Thruster.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.248
-[Chris] Right in the face.
-[Tiki] Ten bonus points.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.483
Getting there is easy.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.251
-Easier.
-[Chris] Yes.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.986
[Tiki] Jumping back, not so easy.

10:54.053 --> 10:55.855
[shouting]

10:55.921 --> 10:57.590
Oh, my God! He's awesome!

10:57.923 --> 11:00.760
[in English] Very good, huh?
Thank you very much. Thank you.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.930
-[cheering]
-[Chris] Comfortable through these.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.566
I tell you what,
he's stunting on the Beast right now.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.467
[Tiki laughs]

11:11.270 --> 11:12.571
[Chris grunts]

11:12.638 --> 11:15.875
[Tiki] You know, I like his ability
to spread his legs and land.

11:15.941 --> 11:19.245
A lot of competitors who spread their legs
get off-balance.

11:19.311 --> 11:21.781
[Chris] And he has 75 points.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.817
[shouts] Miguel Espada!

11:24.884 --> 11:27.153
[in Spanish] Come on.
Don't risk it, okay? Don't risk it.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.990
[Chris] You have to jump and strike it.
You can't get it with your T.-rex arms.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.026
-[Tiki] He made that look easy!
-[Chris] Miguel!

11:34.093 --> 11:35.995
[supporters cheering]

11:36.062 --> 11:37.596
[Tiki] He's onto the Sling Shot now.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.765
[cheering continues]

11:41.500 --> 11:43.969
[Tiki] Five points for grabbing
the Sling Shot. He lands.

11:44.036 --> 11:48.007
Now he's got to get his momentum,
so he can thrust onto the Crash Pads.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.942
[Chris] This guy looks like an acrobat.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.678
He's using a jerky motion.
He's got to let go soon.

11:52.745 --> 11:53.679
There he goes!

11:53.746 --> 11:56.148
[Tiki] And he lands!
See, he landed the correct way.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.383
He landed on his belly.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.219
[Chris] Miguel has got the energy
of the entire crowd.

12:00.286 --> 12:03.656
Every nation's cheering for him.
This is quite a performance.

12:11.497 --> 12:12.965
[shouts] Oh!

12:13.032 --> 12:14.767
And he's about to be through!

12:14.834 --> 12:17.103
-[Tiki] Is he gonna do it?
-[Chris] One more, man!

12:17.169 --> 12:18.137
[Tiki] Here we go!

12:18.504 --> 12:19.638
He's gotta jump off.

12:19.705 --> 12:20.740
Awesome, Miguel!

12:20.806 --> 12:23.008
[Chris] Through Level 1, Miguel Espada!

12:23.075 --> 12:24.276
[Tiki] Miguel Espada.

12:24.343 --> 12:25.344
Through Level 1.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.213
[Chris] The Spanish are cheering.

12:27.546 --> 12:31.016
All the points he could get,
except for the Point Thruster

12:31.383 --> 12:32.551
on that first Crash Pad.

12:32.618 --> 12:35.621
He thought about it,
but he did not go for it.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.691
[all singing]

12:40.593 --> 12:42.762
[Chris] Wow,
Spain having a good time over there.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.897
Again, we were not invited to the party.

12:44.964 --> 12:47.333
120 points

12:47.399 --> 12:49.201
for Miguel Espada.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.204
[in Spanish] That went well, right?
We'll see how I fare on Level 2.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.206
I have to face it with the same attitude.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.342
Stay happy and look forward.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.511
[Tiki] That puts him in the lead!

12:58.577 --> 13:02.815
But right now, France's Remi Fantino
has made his way to Faceplant.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.252
Should we jinx him?

13:06.318 --> 13:09.054
No, not yet... Actually, yes!

13:09.121 --> 13:11.190
-[Chris] He's a dentist.
-[Tiki] And look at him.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.324
Look at those teeth!

13:12.992 --> 13:15.594
[Francesco mimics jinxing Remi]

13:15.661 --> 13:17.496
Focus! Focus!

13:18.430 --> 13:20.933
[Chris] He missed it.
And now it gets tough.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.803
It's tough when you start swinging
because you're backwards.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.638
-[Chris] But he gets on.
-[Tiki] He got it.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.807
35 points now for Remi.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.675
[both hosts cheer]

13:29.742 --> 13:32.244
-You did it. Well done, Remi.
-Come on now...

13:32.311 --> 13:35.548
[Chris] I wonder what he's thinking?
"Did I remember to floss?"

13:37.183 --> 13:39.485
-Oh! And he made it.
-[Tiki] He hangs on.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.421
-[Chris] Remi, Remi, Remi!
-[Tiki] His feet slipped, but he hangs on.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.491
[Chris] I am a Fantino of Remi right now.
He's doing well.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.129
-Made that look so easy.
-[Tiki] Yes.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.965
Come on, keep going, keep going!

13:53.032 --> 13:55.467
[Tiki] Remi is going through
the Energy Coils with ease.

13:55.534 --> 13:56.969
[cheering]

13:57.036 --> 13:59.271
He made it. Great. He made it.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.940
Remi's finding this very easy.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.108
He's about to reach
the blue Energy Coils,

14:03.175 --> 14:04.743
which are closer together.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.345
[Tiki] Here's the Point Thruster.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.147
He's gonna contemplate it.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.616
This jump is actually not that difficult,

14:10.683 --> 14:13.219
but touching that Thruster
for ten extra points...

14:13.285 --> 14:15.054
-[Chris] ...is.
-[Tiki] And then landing?

14:15.120 --> 14:17.022
He decides to not think about it.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.225
[Chris] Which, I think, is a smart move.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.528
It's... I mean, at this point,
he's racking up points.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.029
Now, he's onto the Sling Shot,

14:24.096 --> 14:27.132
which is all about how you grab it
and where you grab it

14:27.199 --> 14:29.134
so you don't get torque and twisting.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.304
He makes it to the Sling Shot.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.505
[Chris] All right!

14:33.572 --> 14:36.909
[Tiki] Now he's gotta land from
the Sling Shot onto the Crash Pad.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.410
He just hangs on!

14:38.477 --> 14:39.879
[Chris] Just hangs on!

14:39.945 --> 14:42.948
There's a Point Thruster
for ten points, but it's risky.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.053
Oh! There he goes!

14:48.120 --> 14:51.590
[Sandy] Oh, no! No, no, no, Remi!

14:51.657 --> 14:53.692
[both sing mockingly]

14:53.759 --> 14:56.795
[Tiki] This is why that Point Thruster
is so difficult.

14:57.363 --> 15:00.733
[Chris] Going for the Thruster there
is dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.705
Next up,
this girl's from my hometown, Tiki.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.407
She's a former gymnast, a stuntwoman.

15:08.474 --> 15:09.842
-Guess what else?
-[Tiki] What?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.977
[Chris] She's from Brooklyn. In the house!

15:12.044 --> 15:14.280
[cheering]

15:15.247 --> 15:17.116
[Tiki] One more
and she's onto the Faceplant.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.584
25 points for Natalie.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.820
[Chris] Natalie making it
look easy so far. No problem at all.

15:21.887 --> 15:23.555
That's how Brooklyn does it.

15:23.622 --> 15:24.757
Collecting herself.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.426
[Tiki] She's got her American compatriots

15:28.027 --> 15:29.228
cheering "oossaa."

15:29.995 --> 15:30.829
[Chris] USA.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.197
[Tiki] Come on!

15:32.264 --> 15:33.766
Control your breathing.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.368
Keep your core engaged, grab this chain.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.938
-[Chris] Come on.
-[Tiki] Get on the Energy Coil.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.807
-[Chris] Yes! Yes! Yes!
-[Tiki] She held on!

15:42.675 --> 15:45.010
She kicked herself
away from that Energy Coil

15:45.077 --> 15:46.178
so she doesn't stagnate.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.414
-[Chris] She's through!
-[Tiki] There she goes.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.616
[Chris] Hug that coil, baby!
You deserve it.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.588
-[teammate] You got it!
-It's a big jump. Big jump.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.824
-[Chris] Come on, Natalie.
-[Tiki] These jumps...

16:00.793 --> 16:03.262
She had a little doubt
on her face right there.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.030
[Chris] She looks worried because...

16:05.097 --> 16:07.232
[Tiki] She needs some encouragement here.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.001
[crowd chanting] Natalie!

16:09.068 --> 16:10.135
[Chris] Come on, Natalie.

16:10.202 --> 16:13.038
[Tiki] Preparing. She's gonna use
her arms and propel herself.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.707
[Chris] Oh, and she made it!

16:14.773 --> 16:16.175
-She made it!
-[Tiki] What a jump!

16:16.241 --> 16:17.609
What a catch!

16:17.676 --> 16:19.111
-[Chris] Yes!
-[Tiki] Oh, my God!

16:19.178 --> 16:21.013
[Chris] Brooklyn is doing it right now.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.514
[Tiki] That was amazing!

16:22.581 --> 16:23.849
[Chris] This feels fantastic!

16:23.916 --> 16:26.218
She hurt her stomach, though.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.220
[Tiki] She got the air knocked out of her.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.490
[Chris] She got winded. Take a second.
Gather yourself. But you've got to go.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.193
[Tiki] She's got a bit of a cut
on her arm. That doesn't matter.

16:34.259 --> 16:37.096
-[Chris] Doesn't matter.
-[Tiki] Give back that blood to the Beast.

16:38.364 --> 16:39.698
Good job, Natalie!

16:39.765 --> 16:40.599
[Natalie yells]

16:40.666 --> 16:42.668
[Chris] Oh, but she cut her arm open.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.204
-[Tiki] Pretty good.
-[Chris] Yeah, that's a gash.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.175
[Tiki] She's crying now. That hurts, man.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.211
[Chris] No, Natalie, you can do it!

16:52.277 --> 16:53.278
[cries] My arm!

16:53.345 --> 16:55.447
[cheering]

16:55.514 --> 16:57.850
[Chris] That is a serious gash. I will...

16:57.916 --> 17:00.085
[Tiki] That's gonna require stitches.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.855
-Breathe!
-[in English] Natalie, it's okay! Breathe!

17:04.522 --> 17:08.594
[Chris] She cut her arm open
with giving every single thing she had.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.262
She can't feel her arm right now.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.265
Relax! Just relax! You're good!

17:13.332 --> 17:14.333
[woman] Relax!

17:17.869 --> 17:20.539
[cheering]

17:20.606 --> 17:21.440
[Chris] Yes!

17:21.507 --> 17:24.343
-Oh, my God!
-Brooklyn is doing it right now!

17:24.410 --> 17:25.711
That was amazing!

17:25.778 --> 17:27.913
[chanting] USA! USA!

17:27.980 --> 17:32.918
[all chanting] Natalie! Natalie! Natalie!
Natalie! Natalie! Natalie!

17:32.985 --> 17:35.087
[Chris] Wow!
Is she gonna go for it right here?

17:35.754 --> 17:38.457
[Tiki] She is gonna go for it.
You can't hold a good woman down!

17:38.524 --> 17:39.892
[Chris] You can't hold her down.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.496
[shouting]

17:46.131 --> 17:47.666
[Chris] Good job, Natalie!

17:48.100 --> 17:50.669
-She's my hero.
-[Tiki] We're competing, but all together.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.571
And how can you not root for her?

17:52.638 --> 17:55.607
The effort that Natalie just gave!

17:55.874 --> 17:59.344
[Chris] She gave it everything. That's
what the red in the flag is - blood.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.180
[Tiki] Let's watch the replay.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.182
[Chris] Where she hit her elbow,
I believe...

18:03.248 --> 18:05.918
she didn't even feel it.
It was pure, pure adrenaline.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.519
Rubbing the blood on her face.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.721
-[Tiki] She's got Braveheart going on.
-[Chris] Nice!

18:10.222 --> 18:13.058
I think I just had a really hard impact,
and so...

18:13.592 --> 18:15.027
split open my arm and I was...

18:16.695 --> 18:18.464
just surprised...

18:18.530 --> 18:19.798
[yells in pain]

18:19.865 --> 18:20.999
Sorry.

18:21.066 --> 18:25.571
Just surprised I made it,
and just really, really, stupidly excited.

18:25.637 --> 18:30.909
[all cheering] Natalie! Natalie! Natalie!
Natalie! Natalie! Natalie! Natalie!

18:30.976 --> 18:32.010
[whooping]

18:32.878 --> 18:35.247
[Tiki] The Beast left its mark on Natalie.

18:35.314 --> 18:39.818
Here's a look at six more competitors
who hope to bite back against the Beast.

18:40.252 --> 18:43.388
Competing for Italy
was trainer Arianna Bonardi,

18:43.455 --> 18:46.558
who was hoping to have
the mother of all runs.

18:46.625 --> 18:50.129
[Arianna in Italian] She's my mom,
she's the one who raised me.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.332
And I really want to win for her.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.902
[Tiki] She had
a wardrobe malfunction early on.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.004
-[Chris] She lost her shoe!
-[Tiki] She lost it!

18:59.071 --> 19:01.140
Push! Push her forward!

19:01.540 --> 19:02.641
[mimic blowing air]

19:02.708 --> 19:05.611
[Chris] Italy's huffing and puffing.
They're nervous for their girl.

19:06.044 --> 19:08.780
[Tiki groans]
That one, she definitely touched.

19:09.715 --> 19:13.585
Bollywood film mogul, Aditya Shroff,
was aiming for a blockbuster run.

19:13.652 --> 19:18.223
And now, coming up, Aditya Shroff,
from Mumbai, India!

19:18.290 --> 19:20.759
[Vidyut] Come on, Aditya,
you'd better be good now. Slowly.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.794
[Tiki] What a mistake he made!

19:22.861 --> 19:25.931
But one huge misstep cut his dream short.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.699
-Why?
-[Chris] He stepped on the black.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.368
I believe he's disqualified.

19:29.434 --> 19:32.304
[chuckling] God,
you've got to feel like an idiot, yeah.

19:32.371 --> 19:33.705
[both laugh]

19:34.072 --> 19:35.841
[Tiki] Here's Lluís Barbé,

19:35.908 --> 19:37.643
a judo master from Spain.

19:37.709 --> 19:40.445
[Chris] His last name's Barbie.
It's a feminine-sounding name,

19:40.512 --> 19:42.080
but this guy's a man's man.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.949
[Tiki] He looked good through Grinder.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.685
Then, his nerve got the best of him.

19:46.752 --> 19:50.355
I don't believe it! He fell.
He became overconfident.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.524
[Tiki] Here's Sumir Kapoor.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.960
A B-Boy dancer from India.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.129
[Chris] Look, he's doing the worm.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.263
Go, India!

19:58.330 --> 20:00.199
He's showing his B-Boy moves.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.668
We need to see his moves on the course.

20:02.734 --> 20:03.802
I know.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.771
[Tiki] He danced his way to Faceplant.

20:05.837 --> 20:06.838
[shouting]

20:06.905 --> 20:08.540
[Chris] Sumir! Hanging on!

20:08.607 --> 20:10.676
-[Tiki] Now he has to climb up.
-[Chris] Climb up!

20:11.009 --> 20:12.344
Try harder!

20:12.411 --> 20:14.980
-[Tiki] But ultimately, swung off.
-[Sarah-Jane] No, no!

20:15.047 --> 20:17.516
-[Chris] Sumir!
-[Tiki] Into the blood of the Beast.

20:17.783 --> 20:20.752
Peng Wu had tons of confidence
heading into the Beast.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.622
[Chris] He's a cancer survivor
and a personal trainer.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.991
Big pun.
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot!

20:26.058 --> 20:27.826
[shouting]

20:29.561 --> 20:31.196
[Tiki] He tried to bear-hug the chain!

20:31.964 --> 20:33.298
Use your hands, son!

20:33.699 --> 20:35.100
That's too bad.

20:38.136 --> 20:39.938
[Chris] Let's check out the leaderboard.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.408
[Tiki] Miguel Espada of Spain
sits in first place

20:43.475 --> 20:45.944
with Frenchman Remi Fantino in second.

20:46.011 --> 20:48.513
Aditya Shroff, Arianna Bonardi

20:48.580 --> 20:50.983
and Lluís Barbé have been eliminated.

20:53.051 --> 20:55.988
[Chris] Guess who's going up next?
The guy I've been waiting for.

20:56.054 --> 20:58.490
Gabe's out to prove
he's more than a football player

20:58.557 --> 21:02.160
because off the field, he's a bad boy
on every possible level.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.129
-[Chris and Tiki] Ooh!
-[shouts] USA!

21:04.429 --> 21:06.298
Was that Will Smith?

21:08.300 --> 21:11.003
In my household, academics was a priority.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.539
I picked up playing the cello
around the fourth grade.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.410
Took the route of studying Mandarin
Chinese, and I studied for two years.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.246
Football became a priority pretty quickly.

21:21.647 --> 21:24.883
People underestimated
my football abilities all the time.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.753
People see that I hit that switch

21:27.819 --> 21:30.322
and turn that aggression on
on the football field.

21:30.389 --> 21:31.990
It throws them off-guard,

21:32.057 --> 21:36.361
and I absolutely love
flipping people's expectations of me.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.230
I'm all about precision,

21:38.297 --> 21:41.433
so I'm ready to attack and kill the Beast.

21:43.935 --> 21:46.371
[Chris] If he lands this jump,
Peng Wu is through.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

21:58.417 --> 21:59.384
He has done it!

21:59.451 --> 22:00.986
Peng Wu has been eliminated.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.654
USA on the sidelines.

22:03.955 --> 22:06.124
[Tiki] Gabe is a big athlete.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.093
He's six foot... Oh wow!

22:08.160 --> 22:10.729
-What was that?
-[Chris] That was a really bad jump!

22:10.796 --> 22:12.831
-[Tiki] What are you doing?
-[Chris] He made it.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.334
-Pure strength. He made it.
-[Tiki] Wow.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.501
[Chris] That was...

22:16.568 --> 22:20.105
-[Tiki] He got the Point Thruster.
-[Chris] He lacks confidence jumping back.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.340
[Tiki] How can you?

22:21.406 --> 22:22.341
What was that?

22:23.375 --> 22:24.409
[Chris] Gabe!

22:24.476 --> 22:25.844
It's pure strength now.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.646
[Tiki] Here's the issue with Gabe -

22:28.013 --> 22:29.614
he's 205 pounds.

22:29.681 --> 22:33.385
If you get that much weight
moving forward, at least vertically,

22:33.452 --> 22:35.754
he's gonna have to grab on
every single time.

22:36.154 --> 22:38.090
And so far, so good for Gabe.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.727
Oh! Does he get it? Yes!

22:41.793 --> 22:44.563
He's very confident
with his upper body and his strength.

22:44.629 --> 22:45.597
[Chris] Hell yeah!

22:46.732 --> 22:48.867
[Tiki] He's got a technique
that's working for him.

22:49.935 --> 22:50.969
Now look how heavy...

22:51.036 --> 22:53.638
You can see the Energy Coils.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.775
You see how those things aren't stable?
They are not locked in.

22:56.842 --> 23:00.579
You can see, because he's so heavy,
they're moving. Look behind him.

23:00.846 --> 23:03.315
Let's see
if he can get this Point Thruster. Yes!

23:03.382 --> 23:04.616
He does it!

23:04.950 --> 23:06.284
[Chris] Flying through midair!

23:07.119 --> 23:08.153
[shouts] Let's go!

23:11.022 --> 23:13.325
[Tiki] Now he's got the Sling Shot.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.395
It's a lot of muscle in your upper body
to hold on to that.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.563
He grabs it, keeps his elbows bent.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.033
Let's see, does he get it?

23:22.100 --> 23:23.635
[Chris] He's got it! He's holding on!

23:23.702 --> 23:25.537
Lock your knee behind you!

23:25.937 --> 23:27.572
[Tiki] Gabe, forget it! Forget it!

23:27.639 --> 23:29.174
[Chris] Gabe, don't get greedy!

23:29.241 --> 23:32.177
[Tiki] He has decided
to forego that Point Thruster.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.612
[Chris] Good idea!

23:33.879 --> 23:36.281
[Tiki] He's got one more jump
on a Crash Pad

23:36.348 --> 23:40.352
and then one more small leap
to the finish to complete Level 1.

23:40.752 --> 23:41.586
Can he do it?

23:41.653 --> 23:42.587
[shouting]

23:42.654 --> 23:44.389
Hold on! Hold on, Gabe!

23:44.456 --> 23:46.691
-Use your strength! Use your strength!
-Oh, my God.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.059
This is pure strength!

23:48.126 --> 23:50.061
Can he do it? Can he do it?

23:50.128 --> 23:51.863
-Hang on!
-Get it, Gabe!

23:51.930 --> 23:55.367
That's what I'm talking about, Gabe!

23:55.434 --> 23:56.368
Yes!

23:56.635 --> 23:58.036
Wow, that was amazing!

23:58.503 --> 24:01.072
Did he jump off? He is through Level 1!

24:01.139 --> 24:03.975
[Chris and Tiki chanting] USA! USA!

24:04.042 --> 24:06.044
[cheering]

24:07.412 --> 24:10.348
[in English] Yes! Come on, America!

24:10.415 --> 24:13.051
[whooping]

24:13.118 --> 24:14.319
[in English] Go, America!

24:20.659 --> 24:22.461
[Chris] Yo! Gabe! Gabe!

24:22.961 --> 24:25.897
-That was amazing!
-How do you feel representing football?

24:25.964 --> 24:28.733
-How do you feel?
-[Gabe] Man, it's an honor,

24:28.800 --> 24:30.469
especially repping USA.

24:31.002 --> 24:33.472
-It's the greatest motivation.
-[Chris] Hell yeah!

24:33.538 --> 24:36.007
See that? American football!

24:36.074 --> 24:37.742
American football!

24:38.276 --> 24:40.512
Now that's the end of Level 1.

24:40.779 --> 24:45.550
Sitting atop the leaderboard
is the USA's Gabe Baker with 120 points,

24:45.617 --> 24:49.287
tying Miguel Espada's point total,
but with a faster run.

24:49.354 --> 24:53.358
In third, it's Frenchman Remi Fantino
with 85 points.

24:53.425 --> 24:56.628
Big story here -
both Americans advance to Level 2.

24:59.698 --> 25:00.999
♪ ...master ♪

25:01.066 --> 25:02.033
Here we go!

25:02.100 --> 25:04.569

25:04.636 --> 25:06.538

25:11.910 --> 25:13.912
[cheering]

25:18.517 --> 25:22.087
[Tiki] Here we are at Level 2
of the Ultimate Beastmaster.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.890
And Gabe Baker from the United States,

25:24.956 --> 25:27.792
about to start his ascent on Spinal Ascent

25:27.859 --> 25:29.995
with 120 points.

25:30.061 --> 25:31.897
Can Gabe hold onto his lead?

25:31.963 --> 25:32.831
Awesome, Gabe!

25:33.431 --> 25:39.371
[Tiki] And remember, only five of these
eight competitors will advance to Level 3.

25:39.437 --> 25:42.407
Gabe is one of my favorite competitors
in this competition.

25:42.474 --> 25:43.708
-You know why?
-[Chris] Why?

25:43.775 --> 25:45.010
[Tiki] He played football.

25:45.076 --> 25:46.945
-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Tiki] Not with your foot,

25:47.012 --> 25:48.213
but American football!

25:48.280 --> 25:50.448
-That's what I'm talking about!
-[Chris] We're in America!

25:50.515 --> 25:51.917
[Tiki] He's a Rice Owl.

25:53.418 --> 25:54.920
Does he get-- Yes, he gets up.

25:54.986 --> 25:57.422
-[Chris] That was pure strength.
-[Tiki] Yeah.

25:57.489 --> 26:00.859
Upper body strength. As this platform
moves, it's all about timing.

26:00.926 --> 26:03.562
Hit it at its apex,
give yourself a chance...

26:03.628 --> 26:05.163
-[Chris] Come on!
-...to get onto...

26:05.230 --> 26:08.300
get on that second level,
the last level of Spinal Ascent.

26:09.601 --> 26:12.037
[Chris] Come on, Gabe.
Let's do it, Gabe! Come on!

26:12.103 --> 26:13.104
Come on, Gabe!

26:13.171 --> 26:14.339
[Tiki] He's got his leg up.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.841
-Can he pull himself fully up?
-[Chris] Get up! Get up!

26:16.908 --> 26:17.909
Get up!

26:17.976 --> 26:19.611
[cheering]

26:19.678 --> 26:21.813
[Chris] Come on, Gabe. Come on!

26:22.581 --> 26:24.516
Do it for Missouri City, Texas.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.518
[Tiki] Everything's bigger in Texas.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.053
Including Gabe.

26:29.054 --> 26:30.622
He just can't...

26:31.189 --> 26:35.994
He can't pull that 200-pound body
up onto that next level.

26:36.661 --> 26:39.331
Having done a lot of pull-ups in my day,

26:39.698 --> 26:42.100
after you get exhausted, you're exhausted.

26:43.802 --> 26:44.803
And that's it.

26:46.037 --> 26:50.775
And that is it for Gabe.
He has got to be so disappointed.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.179
The thing that works in Gabe's favor

26:54.245 --> 27:00.719
is that competitors that moved through
to Level 2 had low scores.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.755
He got so many points in Level 1

27:03.822 --> 27:06.992
that he can still survive into Level 3.

27:07.058 --> 27:09.894
All right, Remi Fantino from France,
the dentist,

27:10.328 --> 27:13.632
getting ready to ascend
the Spine of the Beast.

27:14.099 --> 27:17.135
I hate the dentist. [chuckles]
Do you like the dentist?

27:17.202 --> 27:19.838
My dentist is pretty, so yes,
I do like my dentist.

27:19.904 --> 27:23.174
They're nice people, but I just hate
when people touch my teeth.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.477
[starting alarm blares]

27:25.543 --> 27:28.179
[in French] We're with you all the way,
Remi Fantino!

27:28.246 --> 27:29.948
Go, Remi!

27:31.416 --> 27:32.984
[Tiki] Remi has quite the background -

27:33.051 --> 27:35.053
15 years of running,
9 years of swimming,

27:35.120 --> 27:37.389
and three years
as an obstacle course racer.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.291
He's also done a few triathlons.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.498
He made it. Well done, Remi.

27:46.765 --> 27:50.035
[Chris] Remi said that he sleeps
no more than four or five hours a day,

27:50.101 --> 27:53.738
so he can work ten hours a day,
and still trains several hours a day.

27:53.805 --> 27:55.607
We get it, Remi - you're fantastic.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.641
[Tiki laughs]

27:56.708 --> 27:59.344
[Tiki] He's off to the top
of Spinal Ascent.

27:59.411 --> 28:03.214
And now it's back down
through the cords of Spinal Descent.

28:03.281 --> 28:06.618
[Chris] I would assume he's gonna go
for the Point Thruster at the bottom here.

28:06.951 --> 28:11.289
[Tiki] You would think. There are four
Point Thrusters throughout Level 2.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.593
It looks like he's tangled up
a little bit there.

28:16.494 --> 28:17.629
[in French] Come on...

28:18.863 --> 28:20.398
[Tiki] But he has made it.

28:20.799 --> 28:23.301
-And Chris, you are right. He will opt...
-[Chris] Oh, yeah.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.003
[Tiki] ...to go for the Point Thruster.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.239
[Chris] A very light guy - 150 pounds.

28:28.306 --> 28:30.909
So he should be able
to swing his body here.

28:31.242 --> 28:33.478
Get that foot
right onto the Point Thruster.

28:34.245 --> 28:36.014
[Tiki] Can he get the extra points?

28:37.348 --> 28:38.516
[Chris] Ah, he got it.

28:38.583 --> 28:39.918
[Tiki] He got it. Ten points.

28:39.984 --> 28:42.454
-There you go, that's how to do it!
-He did it!

28:42.520 --> 28:44.856
I want Remi to go all the way tonight.

28:44.923 --> 28:46.391
I can see Remi in the final.

28:48.927 --> 28:52.464
[Gilles] He's such a fan of Rocky,

28:52.530 --> 28:56.668
who is, of course, our executive
producer here at Beastmaster,

28:56.735 --> 28:58.236
Sylvester Stallone.

28:58.303 --> 29:04.375
He took his wife to Philadelphia
to ask for her hand in marriage.

29:04.442 --> 29:10.749
On the steps in the film
on which Rocky asks Adrian.

29:11.316 --> 29:12.984
-[Tiki] Nails it!
-[Chris] He gets on.

29:13.051 --> 29:15.887
[Tiki] That was picture perfect.
He landed right in the middle.

29:17.021 --> 29:19.324
Now he's got to run up the Digestive Track

29:19.390 --> 29:22.494
before it sinks
into the blood of the Beast.

29:23.328 --> 29:26.331
Little steps, Remi.
He's in the Digestive Track.

29:26.397 --> 29:29.000
-[Gilles] Speed up, speed up!
-Quick, quick!

29:29.067 --> 29:32.504
-[Gilles] Come on, Remi, speed up!
-[Sandy] Don't think, Remi, just go!

29:33.505 --> 29:36.808
[Tiki] You gotta make this jump
when it's still above that Dreadmill.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.910
[Chris] And he does! And he nails it.

29:38.977 --> 29:41.679
[Tiki] The Point Thrusters
are what did him in on Level 1.

29:42.881 --> 29:44.315
He's already got one.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.719
There are two more opportunities--
[groans]

29:47.786 --> 29:49.320
-And he's just--
-[Tiki and Chris] Oh!

29:49.721 --> 29:50.622
[Tiki] Brutal!

29:51.189 --> 29:52.690
[Chris] What a brutal fall.

29:52.757 --> 29:54.225
[Tiki] Oh, my goodness!

29:54.292 --> 29:56.528
No! No way!

29:57.629 --> 30:01.299
[Chris] Hey, look. I mean, the dentist
may have to replace one of his teeth.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.601
[Tiki] It looks like he face-planted

30:03.668 --> 30:05.270
into that pad.

30:07.005 --> 30:10.341
[Chris] Okay, next up for Spain,
Miguel Espada.

30:10.408 --> 30:13.778
Miguel used his parkour skills
to become a big-time stuntman.

30:13.845 --> 30:17.415
And his training can put him
on "tapas" the competition.

30:17.682 --> 30:19.384
Get it? "Tapas"?

30:19.918 --> 30:20.752
Tiki?

30:21.352 --> 30:22.453
"Tapas"?

30:25.089 --> 30:29.127
I was already practicing parkour,
but one day, one of my colleagues,

30:29.194 --> 30:33.932
who had already gone
into specialist stunt actions,

30:34.532 --> 30:38.536
told me, "Come with me
to this specialist school I'm attending."

30:39.037 --> 30:42.173
You enter a world where
you need to learn all sorts of things,

30:42.240 --> 30:45.143
because otherwise
you become useless for many stunts.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.612
So it does open lots of doors.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.682
It's crazy.
Here we learn how to ride a horse.

30:50.748 --> 30:54.152
And you learn all sorts of techniques:
how to use a sword,

30:54.219 --> 30:55.186
and lots of things.

30:55.253 --> 30:57.789
How to get run over by a car. It's crazy.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.458
For me, the Beast is like a small kitten.

31:04.829 --> 31:07.332
[Tiki] Making his way down Spinal Descent.

31:07.899 --> 31:11.936
Obviously, as you can see,
a bunch of cords that are intertwined.

31:12.003 --> 31:14.873
It looks easier
than it actually is to get down.

31:15.373 --> 31:19.477
because one misstep, you fall
into the blood of the Beast below.

31:20.078 --> 31:22.013
A perfect descent. Five more points.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.781
Very good. Let yourself drop.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.719
[Tiki] And it looks like
he's going for the Point Thruster.

31:27.785 --> 31:28.753
[Chris] He should.

31:29.053 --> 31:32.357
[Tiki] He did it a little bit differently
than our other competitors.

31:34.292 --> 31:38.062
But he's just as effective
as he moves over to the Stomach Churn.

31:38.129 --> 31:41.499
-That's it. Come on, Miguel! Go, Spain!
-He's ready. Very good.

31:42.033 --> 31:45.603
[Chris] Baker looking on, hoping
that he doesn't get too many points.

31:46.304 --> 31:48.806
-He kind of looks like Jesus there, right?
-[Tiki chuckles]

31:50.875 --> 31:52.810
[Tiki] Wow, he almost over-jumped.

31:53.211 --> 31:55.213
-And he's aggressively--
-[Chris] Oh!

31:55.280 --> 31:56.347
And he gets on!

31:56.414 --> 31:58.816
[Tiki] Aggressively moving
through the Stomach Churn.

31:58.883 --> 32:00.852
[Chris] He's moving. He almost bit it.

32:02.954 --> 32:05.857
[Tiki] You get to this Digestive Track,
you gotta move

32:05.924 --> 32:08.192
'cause it starts to sink into the blood.

32:08.259 --> 32:12.096
He's got to emerge quickly, otherwise he's
going to be too low to make this jump.

32:12.163 --> 32:15.566
The lower he gets down,
the harder the jump onto the Dreadmills.

32:16.234 --> 32:17.902
And you have to get out quickly,

32:17.969 --> 32:20.772
because this jump to the Dreadmills
is quite a leap.

32:20.838 --> 32:21.673
[Chris] He makes it!

32:21.739 --> 32:24.609
Wow! Take that!

32:24.943 --> 32:26.611
[Chris] Both Dreadmills came together.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.747
[Tiki] They did. He almost got complacent.
He's not paying attention!

32:29.814 --> 32:31.883
That Dreadmill is moving away...

32:32.750 --> 32:35.620
-[Chris] He mis-timed the jump.
-[Tiki] That was just horrible.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.289
-Horrible execution.
-[Chris] What do you think went wrong?

32:39.490 --> 32:40.959
[Tiki] He was impatient.

32:41.426 --> 32:44.562
The Dreadmills
are obviously moving against you.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.531
But they're swinging as well.

32:46.597 --> 32:48.499
[Chris] Could've let it swing
one more time.

32:48.566 --> 32:50.001
[Tiki] Or he should've just walked.

32:50.068 --> 32:51.169
It's a Dreadmill. Walk.

32:51.235 --> 32:52.203
-Just walk?
-Walk.

32:52.637 --> 32:56.307
Next up, from China,
it's the world champion rock climber,

32:56.374 --> 32:57.575
Haibin Qu.

32:57.642 --> 33:03.681
Go, China! Go! [screaming]

33:05.650 --> 33:06.517
Hey!

33:06.584 --> 33:07.652
[laughs]

33:07.719 --> 33:08.820
That was intense.

33:11.489 --> 33:14.659
[Haibin in Chinese] In 2008, when I joined
the Chinese National Climbing Team,

33:14.926 --> 33:17.028
I was the youngest in the team.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.297
After training,

33:19.364 --> 33:21.966
I worked hard,

33:22.433 --> 33:23.601
and I improved quickly.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.738
I won a lot of national championships.

33:27.238 --> 33:29.140
Around twice a week,

33:29.207 --> 33:30.308
I teach children

33:30.375 --> 33:34.245
to work hard and do their best.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.280
I will tell them,
as long as they work hard,

33:36.614 --> 33:38.716
they can become stronger

33:39.484 --> 33:42.186
and can face any difficulties,
not just climbing.

33:44.655 --> 33:47.558
[Tiki] There is a billion, three.

33:48.626 --> 33:52.163
1.3 billion people in China.

33:52.630 --> 33:54.665
This man we're looking at right now,

33:55.433 --> 33:58.169
is the national climbing champion.

33:58.236 --> 33:59.704
Let's go and cheer for him.

33:59.837 --> 34:02.306
-Are you going down?
-Yes. He'll succeed, for sure.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.743
[Chris] Oh!

34:05.810 --> 34:09.647
-Haibin Qu lands kind of cock-eyed...
-[Tiki] Hell yeah.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.282
[Chris] ...on the Stomach Churn.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.583
The Chinese
are having a good time down there.

34:13.650 --> 34:17.487
-China! China! China!
-[all] Go! Go! Go!

34:17.554 --> 34:18.989
[Chris] Getting them pumped.

34:19.456 --> 34:22.560
[Tiki] Haibin's gotta be quick
through this Digestive Track.

34:22.860 --> 34:27.831
As you see, it starts to tilt down
into the blood of the Beast.

34:28.498 --> 34:31.735
Jumping out of this thing
onto the Dreadmills from height...

34:31.803 --> 34:34.505
-[Chris] He made it to the Dreadmill.
-[Tiki] ...is the best way.

34:34.572 --> 34:38.109
He's easily on the first one.
Quickly to the second of the Dreadmills.

34:38.409 --> 34:43.748
One more leap, and he'll find himself
preparing for Chain Reaction.

34:46.016 --> 34:49.654
Getting his countrymen involved
with some odd-looking jumping jacks.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.757
[Chris] Haibin with a nice jump
onto Chain Reaction.

34:54.425 --> 34:57.295
[Tiki] Is he going to...
He's going for a Point Thruster.

34:57.361 --> 35:00.465
And he nails it!
Ten extra points for Haibin.

35:01.065 --> 35:03.701
Now he's got to use momentum,
swinging back and forth

35:03.768 --> 35:08.706
to get enough speed to carry him
into the Vertabrace.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.309
[chanting] Haibin! China! Haibin! China!

35:11.375 --> 35:13.044
[Tiki] Yes, it is a long way away.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.581
[Chris] And he hooks it!
Haibin Qu is hooked in.

35:16.647 --> 35:18.549
The Vertabrace are 200 pounds.

35:18.616 --> 35:21.152
[Tiki] Now he's just got to get himself
balanced in there.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.956
[all cheering] China! Haibin!
China! Haibin!

35:25.490 --> 35:27.658
[Chris] Wow, Haibin Qu. Very impressive.

35:28.059 --> 35:30.761
He gets through this,
he'll start the Bin Dynasty.

35:30.828 --> 35:33.197
[Tiki] Oh! Six Vertabrace.

35:33.264 --> 35:36.534
As Chris just said, 200 pounds,

35:36.601 --> 35:37.935
seven feet apart.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.372
So this is not a short jump
for these athletes.

35:43.941 --> 35:46.244
-He gets the Point Thruster.
-[Chris] Good for him.

35:47.912 --> 35:50.648
[Tiki] He's now got three
of the four Point Thrusters.

35:50.715 --> 35:54.352
That's 30 extra points for Haibin Qu

35:54.418 --> 35:55.653
on Level 2.

35:57.755 --> 35:59.190
[Chris] He nailed it!

35:59.257 --> 36:01.592
Nailed it!
[in high-pitched voice] Nailed it!

36:04.195 --> 36:07.165
[Tiki] One more leap.

36:10.468 --> 36:13.171
225 points!

36:13.237 --> 36:15.039
[Chris in normal voice]
About to get through.

36:15.106 --> 36:17.141
The Chinese team is running to celebrate.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.743
Let's see if he can make it.

36:20.511 --> 36:22.647
Wow! What a jump!

36:22.880 --> 36:25.149
-[Chris and Tiki] Oh!
-[Tiki] He makes it.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.684
He's finished it!

36:26.751 --> 36:30.254
[chanting] Haibin, you can do it!
Haibin, you can do it!

36:30.321 --> 36:34.392
[Tiki] This is one of the most
spectacular runs that we've seen!

36:35.927 --> 36:37.962
Setting the pace on Level 2.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.633
[Bin] He's the best!

36:43.034 --> 36:46.204
-Yes!
-Haibin Qu is in first place!

36:46.270 --> 36:49.640
-He will move on to the next level.
-He completed all of Level 2.

36:49.707 --> 36:50.641
Congratulations.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.077
Say a few words.

36:53.144 --> 36:53.978
I don't know.

36:54.412 --> 36:56.647
It was quite easy for me.

36:57.582 --> 37:01.886
[Bin] It was too easy for him.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.289
I have a question.
Who do you want to defeat?

37:05.356 --> 37:07.058
Everyone!

37:07.124 --> 37:08.559
There was no name mentioned.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.228
He wants to defeat everybody.

37:10.294 --> 37:12.930
Do you know that?
Come and challenge our Chinese team.

37:12.997 --> 37:13.831
[Qinyi] Great job!

37:15.733 --> 37:19.203
[Tiki] The remaining competitors
all need to score 100 points

37:19.270 --> 37:21.739
in order to knock Gabe Baker out.

37:21.806 --> 37:25.509
To pass Gabe, they'll need to make it
all the way to Chain Reaction.

37:25.810 --> 37:31.649
The first one to make an attempt
is B-Boy dancer Sumir Kapoor.

37:33.951 --> 37:37.121
[Chris] The B-Boy dancer slash engineer,
Mr. Beautiful.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.824
His dance team's called Chaos Factory.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.127
[Tiki] He also boxes in New Delhi.

37:43.194 --> 37:44.061
[Chris] Oh, really?

37:44.128 --> 37:46.731
He tells you he's a B-Boy dancer
on a dance team,

37:46.797 --> 37:49.066
you make fun of him.
Next, you're gonna get punched.

37:49.133 --> 37:50.901
[Tiki] He's only 5'3", though.

37:51.402 --> 37:52.937
Come on. You've got this!

37:53.004 --> 37:54.472
Come on. You've got this!

37:54.805 --> 37:56.374
-[in English] Come on.
-Pull! Very good.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.510
-Very good. Come on. Come on.
-Pull, tiger. Pull harder.

38:01.545 --> 38:03.347
[Tiki] He is really struggling.

38:03.414 --> 38:06.217
[Chris] He's trying to grab.
He's putting every bit of effort...

38:06.284 --> 38:09.587
Do it! Anything!
Shimmy onto it, you're a dancer. Come on!

38:09.654 --> 38:12.390
-Oh, no!
-[in English] Oh, my God!

38:12.456 --> 38:14.492
Oh, my God!

38:14.558 --> 38:17.194
[Chris] Sumir Kapoor is kaput.

38:17.261 --> 38:18.896
Let's check out the leaderboard.

38:19.363 --> 38:23.934
[Tiki] Sumir Kapoor is on the bubble
with three runs left to go.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.977
[Chris] Oh yeah, here we go.
Antonio Alberto Bosso.

38:33.044 --> 38:36.147
With big holes in his ears
from the stupid earrings kids wear.

38:36.447 --> 38:40.451
Oh! The Spaniards are with the Italianos.

38:40.518 --> 38:44.288
Yes, we want to cheer for Italy.
They deserve it. Go, Francesco.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.724
Come on!
A lot of energy from Spain, too!

38:46.791 --> 38:50.127
Spain is a country
full of strength and energy!

38:51.362 --> 38:54.565
[Tiki] Down Spinal Descent,
onto the first of Stomach Churn.

38:55.066 --> 39:00.471
Okay. Bosso turns around.
He will go for the Point Thruster.

39:00.538 --> 39:03.441
[Chris] Here we go. Come on,
show them who's the Bosso.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.509
[Tiki] He decides against it.
No, thank you.

39:05.576 --> 39:07.878
-[Chris] Okay.
-[Tiki] He almost walks off that platform.

39:08.279 --> 39:10.514
Jumps onto the next of the Stomach Churns.

39:10.581 --> 39:12.116
[Chris] Of the Stomach Churners.

39:13.284 --> 39:15.353
[Tiki] Onto the third Stomach Churn.
Here he goes!

39:15.419 --> 39:17.822
-[Chris] There we go. Wow!
-[Tiki] Onto the final one.

39:17.888 --> 39:19.557
Come on! Come on!

39:19.623 --> 39:22.093
Work your magic! Work your magic!

39:22.159 --> 39:24.128
[Tiki] The Digestive Track is next.

39:24.462 --> 39:27.131
It is a little chilly out here
in the belly of the Beast.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.268
In the Digestive Track.

39:31.335 --> 39:32.403
[shouting]

39:32.470 --> 39:33.838
[Chris] But he's still in!

39:33.904 --> 39:35.740
Come on! Come on!

39:35.806 --> 39:38.042
You can make it!

39:38.676 --> 39:40.945
[Chris] I don't know how he saves this.

39:41.011 --> 39:42.880
This is actually incredible!

39:42.947 --> 39:47.284
[Tiki] He might be better off
grabbing the Digestive Track.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.954
-[Chris] Oh, my God, come on!
-[Tiki] He's gonna try.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.856
-[Chris] He tried to do it.
-Oh!

39:51.922 --> 39:53.924
[Tiki] But he just missed.

39:53.991 --> 39:55.993
[Chris] And he got all mixed up.

39:56.761 --> 39:59.196
[Tiki] Looks like his legs
were maybe a little bit dead.

40:00.097 --> 40:03.267
He didn't even get a step in

40:03.334 --> 40:06.771
before he got rejected
out of the Digestive Track.

40:07.338 --> 40:10.641
[Chris] He had indigestion
getting into the Digestive Track.

40:10.708 --> 40:12.710
The Beast had some indigestion is right.

40:13.144 --> 40:16.847
So that slipup by Bosso
lands him right on the bubble,

40:16.914 --> 40:20.084
which means Sumir Kapoor
of India has been eliminated

40:20.151 --> 40:23.687
and China's Haibin Qu,
Spain's Miguel Espada,

40:23.754 --> 40:26.957
and Remi Fantino of France
all advance to Level 3.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.127
[Chris] Yes, the moment
I've been waiting for.

40:30.194 --> 40:35.199
Next up on Level 2,
the French pole dancer, Laura Mété.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.836
[Tiki] She comes in with 40-- Oh!

40:39.370 --> 40:40.538
[Chris] Come on, Laura!

40:40.604 --> 40:42.373
[Tiki] She's gonna have to get 40 points

40:42.773 --> 40:44.942
to make it on to Level 3,

40:45.009 --> 40:48.412
because only
our top five competitors will advance.

40:48.479 --> 40:51.248
It's the two biggest rivals
going head-to-head -

40:51.315 --> 40:53.083
France versus Italy.

40:53.150 --> 40:57.488
If Laura gets to the second Stomach Churn,
it's bon voyage, Bosso.

40:58.289 --> 41:02.359
[Chris] She was number two
in the French pole sports championships.

41:02.893 --> 41:05.196
[Tiki] She doesn't have
the leaping ability

41:05.563 --> 41:10.100
to just jump on to these platforms
on Spinal Ascent.

41:11.268 --> 41:14.672
But, she has great climbing ability.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.741
-Yes, yes, yes! She got it!
-[Chris] And she got it!

41:17.808 --> 41:20.077
Laura Mété all day.

41:20.177 --> 41:21.545
[Chris] Laura's fired up.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.149
-We believe in you, Laura!
-Here they come...

41:25.216 --> 41:27.518
-No, not you!
-Here they are.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.620
-Not you!
-Here he is.

41:29.687 --> 41:33.557
-[Sandy] It's France against Italy.
-We're with our French friends.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.793
-[Sandy] We'll watch together.
-We'll jinx them.

41:35.860 --> 41:38.429
-They are very noisy!
-We are professional jinxers!

41:38.496 --> 41:42.700
-Jinx!
-[Sandy] We'll block their view...

41:44.101 --> 41:45.503
[Chris] I haven't seen this.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.872
She's coming out a little too early,
I think.

41:49.540 --> 41:52.543
[Tiki] She's actually making her way
over to the Point Thruster,

41:52.610 --> 41:54.311
which is an important play...

41:57.848 --> 41:59.617
Come on, Laura. Come on, Laura...

41:59.683 --> 42:00.885
[cheering]

42:07.424 --> 42:09.126
[Chris] Oh, wow, look at that!

42:09.193 --> 42:12.696
-Oh my... Did you see that move?
-[Tiki] That was athletically impressive.

42:12.763 --> 42:14.031
[Chris] That was amazing.

42:14.899 --> 42:16.500
The Italians are on the ropes.

42:16.567 --> 42:20.304
Laura is just two jumps away from
knocking Bosso out of the competition.

42:21.005 --> 42:23.541
Please, eliminate the guy,

42:23.607 --> 42:26.710
so that this guy behind me
can stop his bullshit.

42:26.777 --> 42:28.579
[Sandy in English] Go, girl! Go, girl!

42:28.646 --> 42:29.747
[Gilles] Come on, Laura!

42:29.813 --> 42:31.882
-Come on, Laura!
-[Sandy in French] Come on, Laura!

42:32.683 --> 42:35.452
[Tiki] She just knocked out Antonio.

42:35.519 --> 42:38.188
[cheering]

42:38.255 --> 42:39.723
[shouts] Laura!

42:40.057 --> 42:42.059
[Tiki] Laura's got one more jump...

42:43.761 --> 42:45.729
to the last of the Stomach Churns.

42:45.796 --> 42:46.997
She nails it!

42:48.766 --> 42:53.504
Dropping her feet
as she takes on the Digestive Track.

42:54.204 --> 42:57.775
This should be the first
female competitor to go this far.

42:57.841 --> 43:00.311
She's got to get up quickly
and make this jump...

43:00.377 --> 43:01.345
[Chris] Come on, Laura!

43:01.412 --> 43:04.615
[Tiki] ...while the Digestive Track
still has height. She's got to go!

43:04.682 --> 43:05.983
Just go! Go, Laura!

43:06.050 --> 43:08.652
[Chris] No! You have to do it now!
Laura, no!

43:09.186 --> 43:11.021
[Tiki] Ah! She poses.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.257
-[Chris] Wow!
-[Tiki] As she poses...

43:13.324 --> 43:15.192
[wails]

43:15.259 --> 43:17.761
[Chris] Oh, Laura. Wow.

43:18.796 --> 43:21.131
She could see
she was already too low.

43:21.198 --> 43:22.967
She did the right thing

43:23.033 --> 43:26.070
and she said "bye-bye" to the Italians
with great elegance.

43:26.570 --> 43:28.505
[Tiki] A couple replays to look at here.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.174
As she nails the Point Thruster,

43:30.240 --> 43:32.810
which is important
because it gives her 10 points,

43:32.876 --> 43:34.878
and she tries
to get on the Stomach Churn...

43:34.945 --> 43:36.413
[Chris] Watch this! Wow!

43:37.081 --> 43:39.249
[Tiki] And here she is.
She had some time, I think,

43:39.316 --> 43:41.352
to make this jump to Digestive Track.

43:41.418 --> 43:43.487
[Chris] I really do not know
why she didn't jump.

43:43.554 --> 43:46.290
Seriously.
I mean, she could get eliminated.

43:47.825 --> 43:50.094
Uh-oh. Next up, we got our girl.

43:50.761 --> 43:53.564
From Brooklyn, Natalie Strasser.

43:53.631 --> 43:56.300
She got stitches in Level 1,

43:56.367 --> 43:59.470
so she's competing
with a pretty significant injury.

44:00.004 --> 44:02.039
[Natalie] On the Energy Coils...

44:02.106 --> 44:04.508
-[Tiki] And she made it! What a jump!
-[Chris] Yes!

44:04.575 --> 44:07.911
[Natalie] ...when I flying squirreled
and caught it, I tore my arm open,

44:07.978 --> 44:09.747
and I was bleeding a lot.

44:10.080 --> 44:13.083
-[Chris] That is a serious gash.
-[Natalie] So I have 8 stitches in my arm.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.818
I'm feeling pretty good for it.

44:14.885 --> 44:18.255
I have it bandaged up
with some padding right here.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.924
Yeah, as ready as I'll ever be.

44:21.859 --> 44:25.362
[Tiki] She's currently sitting
with 40 points,

44:25.429 --> 44:30.768
so in order to knock Laura,
who we just saw, out of the competition,

44:31.435 --> 44:33.837
she's got to score 60 points

44:34.271 --> 44:36.540
and make it all the way
past Digestive Track.

44:39.943 --> 44:42.046
-[Chris] Natalie!
-[Tiki] Natalie!

44:42.846 --> 44:45.816
[Chris] Natalie! Natalie!

44:46.950 --> 44:48.352
[Chris] Come on, Natalie!

44:49.453 --> 44:53.123
Okay, do you see she's wearing
that left sleeve on her arm,

44:53.190 --> 44:57.361
and that's covering up the bandaging
and the stitches that she got in Level 1.

44:57.428 --> 44:59.096
Right here! Right here! Wait for it.

45:01.899 --> 45:04.334
[Chris] Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

45:04.401 --> 45:05.302
Come on!

45:05.369 --> 45:08.238
-[Tiki] She needs a little more leverage.
-[Chris] Push!

45:08.772 --> 45:10.574
I wanna just run up there and push her.

45:10.641 --> 45:13.977
-[Tiki] She's got it!
-[Chris] You think she's got it?

45:14.044 --> 45:15.646
She's got it. Natalie's got it.

45:15.713 --> 45:18.482
-[Tiki] She spent so much energy, though.
-[Chris] So much energy.

45:18.549 --> 45:21.085
[Tiki] And she still has
one more jump to go.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.721
[Chris] She still has...
I thought she was at the top.

45:23.787 --> 45:26.623
-Damn it!
-Get up, get up, get up!

45:27.057 --> 45:29.560
Just like the last one.
Just like the last one!

45:29.626 --> 45:32.062
-[Chris] She has the highest jump left.
-[Tiki] Yes.

45:32.129 --> 45:34.231
[Chris] So if she struggled there
on the medium,

45:34.698 --> 45:36.200
how is she gonna get to the high?

45:37.735 --> 45:39.036
Come on, Natalie!

45:39.103 --> 45:41.672
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

45:41.739 --> 45:45.242
[Tiki] She's got to employ
the same technique she did before,

45:45.743 --> 45:48.512
which is a bunch of mid-air frog leaps.

45:49.113 --> 45:51.915
It's just really hard
as her grip is loosening.

45:51.982 --> 45:52.950
And falling off.

45:53.617 --> 45:55.085
One hand gone.

45:55.786 --> 45:57.788
it looks like the second one...

45:58.388 --> 45:59.289
is about...

45:59.356 --> 46:01.458
-[Chris] Great manicure.
-[Tiki] ...to give way.

46:02.392 --> 46:03.794
[Chris] There she goes.

46:03.861 --> 46:05.429
Oh, no!

46:06.263 --> 46:09.366
[in English] Such a shame, America.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.734
[in English] It's difficult.

46:10.801 --> 46:11.769
[in French] Well done.

46:13.470 --> 46:18.909
[Tiki] Laura Mété from France
moves on to Level 3.

46:19.576 --> 46:22.079
[Natalie] I'm really happy
that there's been another female

46:22.146 --> 46:23.547
that has advanced to Level 3.

46:24.014 --> 46:26.116
So, I'm super happy for Laura.

46:26.817 --> 46:30.220
Of course, yes,
I would have loved to also advance,

46:30.287 --> 46:34.024
but, you know,
I'm where I'm supposed to be, so...

46:34.525 --> 46:37.361
-Well done, you were superb.
-Thanks for your support.

46:37.427 --> 46:39.797
-Well done. We're so proud.
-[in French] Proud to be French.

46:39.863 --> 46:41.698
-Girl power. [laughs]
-Whoo!

46:41.999 --> 46:43.066
[Sandy] Well done, Laura.

46:43.567 --> 46:47.538
[Tiki] There's our top five.
Two French competitors making the cut.

46:47.604 --> 46:50.307
We'll see if they can catch
Haibin Qu from China.

46:52.776 --> 46:54.778
[all cheering]

46:56.947 --> 46:59.550
[Tiki] Here we are
at Level 3 of the Beast.

46:59.616 --> 47:02.786
Five competitors
trying to make it to Level 4.

47:02.853 --> 47:04.888
Only two of them will advance.

47:04.955 --> 47:06.590
It's game time, baby!

47:07.157 --> 47:09.393
[Laura] I am the last girl
in this competition.

47:09.459 --> 47:10.961
Girl power, I hope...

47:12.362 --> 47:13.697
It's crazy, it really is.

47:13.764 --> 47:15.999
I'm surrounded by guys with massive arms,

47:16.066 --> 47:17.935
and I look like a piece of spaghetti!

47:18.535 --> 47:21.772
But I hope the fact that I'm light,
and I have strong arms,

47:21.839 --> 47:23.240
will be an advantage.

47:23.307 --> 47:24.441
We'll see, anyway.

47:25.943 --> 47:28.011
[Tiki] Laura Mété from France

47:28.078 --> 47:30.480
comes into Level 3 with 95 points,

47:30.547 --> 47:34.218
and she is the first woman
in this competition

47:34.284 --> 47:36.386
to make it to Level 3 of the Beast.

47:45.095 --> 47:49.600
She nails the Ejector
and jump to the Prism Strike.

47:49.666 --> 47:50.500
[Chris] Nice!

47:50.567 --> 47:53.503
[Tiki] She foregoes the opportunity
at the Point Thruster,

47:53.570 --> 47:55.339
easily reaches across,

47:55.405 --> 47:58.508
and is now into the Coil Crawl.

47:58.575 --> 48:00.410
[Chris] The pole dancing is paying off.

48:00.477 --> 48:01.778
Whoa, look at that!

48:01.845 --> 48:03.780
[Tiki] She's jumping
through the Coil Crawl.

48:03.847 --> 48:05.415
We haven't seen that technique yet.

48:05.482 --> 48:07.451
[Chris] The Coil Crawl's never felt
a woman.

48:07.517 --> 48:10.621
[Tiki] So Laura's up to 110 points.

48:10.687 --> 48:15.259
Remember, she needs to outscore
the leaders to have a chance at Level 4.

48:15.325 --> 48:18.862
[Chris] Yeah, she basically needs
to finish Level 3. No pressure, Laura!

48:19.529 --> 48:21.865
She's seriously quick, let me remind you.

48:21.932 --> 48:23.667
And speed is key here, Gilles,

48:23.734 --> 48:26.603
because everything's sinking
into the blood of the Beast,

48:26.670 --> 48:28.372
so you need to be quick.

48:32.743 --> 48:36.079
She's reaching the third one.
This girl is incredible.

48:36.146 --> 48:39.049
She's an extraordinary athlete.
Really extraordinary.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.119
[Tiki] You gotta be quick
through this last Coil.

48:42.185 --> 48:44.988
They start sinking
as soon as the competitors touch it.

48:45.589 --> 48:48.191
She is having a lot of trouble.

48:48.959 --> 48:51.728
You have to be very quick.
Come on, sweetie...

48:51.795 --> 48:54.631
-Speed up and don't let go.
-No, no. Come on! Let's go!

48:56.833 --> 48:59.870
[Chris] She signaled to her countrymen
and women that she's done.

49:00.437 --> 49:02.406
-[Sandy] Well done, Laura!
-[wails]

49:03.440 --> 49:06.276
[Tiki] 20 points for Laura Mété,

49:06.343 --> 49:10.514
leaving her with a grand total
of 115 points,

49:10.580 --> 49:14.051
which means she is eliminated.

49:14.785 --> 49:15.819
I've got cramps.

49:17.421 --> 49:18.855
I knew that bit would be hard.

49:19.656 --> 49:20.824
It's because they move.

49:21.491 --> 49:24.027
They move,
so it's difficult to get a hold,

49:24.094 --> 49:25.896
and then it's hard to hold on! [laughs]

49:27.097 --> 49:29.099
[shouting]

49:29.166 --> 49:31.168
[cheering]

49:32.736 --> 49:36.606
Laura's got this far,
so to me, she's a champion.

49:36.673 --> 49:38.308
She's won so much.

49:40.377 --> 49:41.845
You're amazing.

49:41.912 --> 49:43.113
We're proud.

49:45.482 --> 49:48.352
[Tiki] Up next on Level 3,
the pride of Houston,

49:48.785 --> 49:50.087
Gabe Baker.

49:50.153 --> 49:54.091
[Chris] He has war paint on his face,
giving a tribute to Natalie Strasser.

49:55.025 --> 50:00.230
[Tiki] Thanks to Gabe's Herculean effort
on Level 1 with 120 points,

50:00.697 --> 50:01.965
he is into Level 3.

50:02.032 --> 50:05.669
But Level 2 was a disappointment for him -
only 15 points.

50:05.969 --> 50:07.704
He's got a lot of distance to make up.

50:07.771 --> 50:09.439
He lands the first hand hold.

50:09.506 --> 50:11.141
Nails the Point Thruster.

50:11.742 --> 50:13.243
That's Prism Strike.

50:13.310 --> 50:15.412
All arms and heavy body.

50:15.479 --> 50:18.982
Let's see if he can move
through Coil Crawl with some quickness.

50:19.049 --> 50:20.350
[Chris] And just like Laura,

50:20.417 --> 50:22.085
Gabe really needs to finish Level 3

50:22.152 --> 50:25.922
to have any chance of overtaking
Haibin Qu and Miguel Espada.

50:25.989 --> 50:29.126
But he still looks like Will Smith.

50:29.826 --> 50:31.828
[Tiki] Gabe repping the United States

50:32.262 --> 50:34.631
and football players all over the world.

50:34.698 --> 50:37.567
[chants] Oossaa! Oossaa! Oossaa!

50:37.634 --> 50:41.138
[Tiki] He is heavier, so it gets
a little bit more difficult for him,

50:41.505 --> 50:44.474
as this Coil Crawl starts to sink
almost immediately.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.710
[Chris] He's on the wrong side
of that Coil Crawl.

50:46.777 --> 50:50.347
Like we've been saying,
it's better to go high than to go low.

50:50.414 --> 50:52.816
[Tiki] Yes, the challenge is,
when you're on the bottom,

50:52.883 --> 50:56.319
you have to grab the next
Coil Crawl from the bottom.

50:56.386 --> 50:57.354
[Chris] Come on, Gabe!

50:58.021 --> 51:00.023
[Tiki] Gabe's got a little bit more time.

51:00.090 --> 51:02.559
It's gonna take a big jump
for him to get there.

51:02.626 --> 51:07.130
Just doesn't have the leverage,
leaving him at 160 points.

51:07.197 --> 51:09.433
And because Miguel Espada of Spain,

51:10.000 --> 51:13.870
and Haibin Qu of China
have more points than that,

51:13.937 --> 51:19.643
Gabe Baker from the United States is
officially knocked out of the Beastmaster.

51:20.844 --> 51:22.579
I'm disappointed, I'll be honest.

51:22.646 --> 51:25.549
I always have a high ceiling
for how I like to perform.

51:25.615 --> 51:28.919
So I put myself in a hold,
and it's just how it goes sometimes.

51:28.985 --> 51:32.155
[Chris] And the USA gets KO'd
from tonight's competition.

51:32.222 --> 51:33.490
Love you, Gabe.

51:33.557 --> 51:36.760
[Tiki] Three competitors, two spots,
and one hell of a level

51:36.827 --> 51:39.062
in the battle to advance to the final.

51:39.129 --> 51:42.432
Miguel Espada,
who comes in with 190 points,

51:42.499 --> 51:47.370
needs a huge run on Level 3 to widen
the gap from France's Remi Fantino

51:47.437 --> 51:49.039
who trails by 35 points,

51:49.106 --> 51:52.409
and try to make up ground
on China's Haibin Qu.

51:58.515 --> 52:02.519
Going for the Point Thruster.
He's too low on the hand hold.

52:02.586 --> 52:05.322
Just barely gets to that second hand hold.

52:05.388 --> 52:07.858
Now he will make his way
through the Coil Crawl.

52:07.924 --> 52:10.560
Each one of these Coil Crawls
is about eight feet long.

52:10.627 --> 52:12.429
Five points for each one.

52:12.496 --> 52:16.766
But as we all know, everything in
the Beastmaster eventually starts to sink.

52:16.833 --> 52:19.703
-This is a hard one. Come on! Good.
-Take it easy.

52:20.170 --> 52:22.672
-Straight. Straight like a lizard.
-That's good.

52:26.576 --> 52:28.745
[Tiki] Now, Miguel is the parkour expert.

52:28.812 --> 52:31.448
He has done obstacle course racing.

52:33.150 --> 52:36.887
So this is all kind of natural athleticism
for him so far.

52:40.056 --> 52:42.058
-Come on, Miguel!
-He's holding on.

52:42.125 --> 52:43.793
You've got this, Miguel! Come on!

52:45.929 --> 52:49.132
[Chris] He's got to get through this quick
if he wants to get to Hangman.

52:50.800 --> 52:52.736
[Tiki] He's got to get to the end.
Concentrate.

52:52.802 --> 52:56.573
-Wait. Now jump, I beg you. You'll sink.
-He has to jump now. Now. Now!

52:58.041 --> 53:01.378
[Chris] Oh! Fall into the agua.

53:03.413 --> 53:06.516
[Tiki] Miguel Espada
with 20 points in Level 3,

53:06.583 --> 53:09.486
leaving him with 210 points.

53:09.553 --> 53:13.256
Still 20 points behind Haibin Qu,
who has yet to run.

53:14.257 --> 53:17.260
Miguel raised the bar
for Remi Fantino of France.

53:17.327 --> 53:20.997
Remi now needs at least 55 points,
which means two things -

53:21.064 --> 53:25.068
he has to get to Hangman, and get
every Point Thruster along the way.

53:26.403 --> 53:29.072
Gosh, he looks like Wolverine.

53:30.674 --> 53:32.008
[Tiki] All right, here we go!

53:32.075 --> 53:33.810
[Chris] And he's onto the Ejector.

53:33.877 --> 53:35.011
[Tiki] Remi!

53:35.912 --> 53:39.316
-Oh, Remi!
-[Chris shouting]

53:39.382 --> 53:40.717
-Remi!
-No!

53:40.784 --> 53:42.319
Our French hopes...

53:43.286 --> 53:44.254
have been dashed.

53:44.321 --> 53:46.623
[Tiki] Remi Fantino.

53:46.856 --> 53:51.962
Zero points on Level 3,
and officially knocked out of the Beast.

53:52.028 --> 53:53.697
[Chris] We bid adieu to team France,

53:53.763 --> 53:57.434
as Spanish stuntman Miguel Espada
advances to Level 4,

53:57.500 --> 53:59.369
so Spain celebrating a win,

53:59.436 --> 54:01.538
and the Italians cheering a French loss.

54:01.605 --> 54:02.906
That's cold, y'all.

54:02.973 --> 54:03.940
[singing]

54:04.007 --> 54:06.076
We've come to join the Italian presenters.

54:06.142 --> 54:08.211
Spain got through!

54:08.278 --> 54:10.113
-Spain has gone through!
-Yes!

54:10.580 --> 54:13.783
Our Level 4 is set.

54:13.850 --> 54:19.522
Haibin Qu and Miguel Espada now face off
in a point accumulation battle,

54:19.589 --> 54:20.757
through Level 3.

54:21.057 --> 54:26.029
I hope Haibin can be
the first contestant to clear Level 3.

54:28.231 --> 54:30.166
[Chris] Easy jump onto Prism Strike.

54:31.301 --> 54:33.870
[Tiki] Let's see if he gets
the Point Thruster. He nails it!

54:34.537 --> 54:38.441
He's moving so fast. This is the power
and speed of the Chinese team.

54:39.743 --> 54:41.878
[Tiki] Now making his way
through the Coil Crawl.

54:41.945 --> 54:46.182
Each one of these Coil Crawls -
eight feet long - is worth five points.

54:48.585 --> 54:50.086
[Bin] He's at the last obstacle.

54:50.153 --> 54:52.389
[Qinyi] He's our national
rock climbing champion.

54:52.455 --> 54:55.625
Can our climbing champion,
Haibin, make it through?

54:56.192 --> 54:58.395
Our contestants are cheering for him, too.

55:02.399 --> 55:04.634
[Tiki] You've got to be quick
through this last Coil.

55:04.701 --> 55:07.404
They start sinking
as soon as the competitors touch it.

55:07.470 --> 55:09.372
If you don't get through quick enough,

55:09.939 --> 55:14.477
you don't have a chance
to hop up and grab the Hangman.

55:14.544 --> 55:16.613
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.214
You can do it. Jump!

55:18.281 --> 55:20.483
[both shout]

55:21.451 --> 55:23.853
[Chris] Haibin Qu is already on Hangman.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.856
[Tiki] Another ring he's getting -
that's 5 more points,

55:26.923 --> 55:30.560
putting more distance between himself
and Miguel Espada.

55:31.194 --> 55:32.429
As you'll see,

55:32.495 --> 55:35.332
as soon as he lets go
of one of those rings, it disappears.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.969
Haibin Qu is very deliberate and focused,

55:40.770 --> 55:43.707
slowly moving up Hangman,

55:44.174 --> 55:46.976
expanding that lead over Miguel Espada.

55:47.043 --> 55:50.747
They will face off in Level 4,
but let's remember, this is cumulative,

55:50.814 --> 55:53.616
so the distance
that he has going into Level 4

55:53.683 --> 55:58.054
is the distance that Miguel Espada
will have to make up in Level 4.

55:58.388 --> 56:01.358
-Ten more points with the Point Thruster.
-[Chris] Wow!

56:01.424 --> 56:03.159
He just wanted to get the points.

56:03.226 --> 56:06.329
[Tiki] Haibin Qu
is just balling over here!

56:06.396 --> 56:08.998
[Chris] Balling! Shot caller!

56:10.433 --> 56:11.768
Haibin Qu!

56:11.835 --> 56:15.105
[Tiki] After this, if he wins
the ten grand, then the 50 grand,

56:15.171 --> 56:17.741
he might be dipping into a Benz
with a spoiler.

56:18.975 --> 56:21.478
Haibin Qu may get to the Pipeline.

56:21.544 --> 56:22.479
[Chris] Yeah.

56:25.048 --> 56:28.251
Let's see if Haibin Qu can get
to the Pipeline and give it the pipe.

56:28.551 --> 56:32.188
And remember, being a two-time,
national anything in China is impressive

56:32.255 --> 56:34.424
'cause there's 27 trillion people there.

56:35.225 --> 56:39.996
[Tiki] Interestingly, he chose to attack
that backwards and then turned around.

56:40.063 --> 56:44.601
[Chris] Look at this! It goes up. It gets
harder and harder as you go up. Holy!

56:44.667 --> 56:48.304
[Tiki] Haibin Qu makes it to the wall
at the end of Pipeline.

56:48.371 --> 56:52.509
Now all he has to do is climb up,
and can he be our first competitor?

56:52.575 --> 56:54.878
-[Chris] He got the Point Thruster!
-[Tiki] He heels it!

56:54.944 --> 56:57.847
Haibin Qu
is making mincemeat of the Beast!

56:57.914 --> 57:01.351
[Chris] Look at how strong he is!
He's  waving it off, like he doesn't care.

57:01.418 --> 57:05.321
-Did you feel that Beast?
-Haibin Qu! Wow!

57:05.388 --> 57:08.491
The first contestant!

57:11.227 --> 57:13.129
That was damn impressive.

57:14.230 --> 57:19.102
Haibin Qu, with 370 points.

57:19.502 --> 57:22.071
Haibin Qu is the best!

57:22.138 --> 57:24.107
China is number one!

57:24.174 --> 57:30.447
[Tiki] Miguel Espada is going to have
to compete out of his mind in Level 4

57:30.513 --> 57:32.482
to beat Haibin Qu.

57:37.153 --> 57:40.023
[Chris] All right,
here we go with Level 4!

57:47.297 --> 57:49.299
[Tiki] Haibin Qu,

57:49.632 --> 57:54.337
commandingly coming into Level 4
with 370 points,

57:54.404 --> 57:56.906
had one of the epic runs of Level 3.

57:56.973 --> 58:02.512
Miguel Espada is 160 points behind
with 210 points.

58:02.579 --> 58:06.449
To beat Haibin Qu,
Miguel's gotta build a commanding lead,

58:06.516 --> 58:10.753
and get that top Point Thruster,
which is worth 200 points.

58:10.820 --> 58:16.059
Haibin Qu is one of the best climbers
in all of China,

58:16.125 --> 58:19.362
winning multiple
national climbing championships,

58:19.429 --> 58:21.965
as he looks to use that experience

58:22.031 --> 58:25.702
to dominate Ricochet,
Full Tilt, The Motherboard, Sky Hook

58:25.768 --> 58:28.404
and maybe, ultimately, The Ventilator.

58:29.205 --> 58:31.875
Come on, Miguel! Come on!

58:32.475 --> 58:33.543
[Chris] Off to the races!

58:33.610 --> 58:36.513
-Go, Spain! Come on!
-Come on! Go!

58:36.579 --> 58:38.248
-Look at Miguel!
-He's leading!

58:38.314 --> 58:41.351
-Wow! What a climber! Yes, sir!
-Look at him! Yes!

58:41.417 --> 58:42.519
Come on! Hurry!

58:42.952 --> 58:44.187
-Wow!
-Decent pace.

58:44.254 --> 58:45.421
Gosh, he's so quick.

58:45.488 --> 58:50.593
[Tiki] Wow! Miguel Espada
leaping up Ricochet with ease.

58:51.427 --> 58:52.562
[Chris] But as we've seen,

58:52.629 --> 58:54.831
you can get a lead, but it doesn't matter

58:54.898 --> 58:59.102
because fatigue plays a major role
in Level 4.

59:00.003 --> 59:01.538
[Tiki] Slowly but surely,

59:01.638 --> 59:04.707
Haibin Qu,
who's the much better climber,

59:04.774 --> 59:08.111
works his way to even as they get
to the bottom of the Motherboard.

59:09.112 --> 59:11.781
Who is going to get
that first Point Thruster?

59:12.448 --> 59:15.885
It's obviously not as important
to Haibin Qu.

59:15.952 --> 59:19.355
[Chris] All the Chinese climbing champ
has to do is reach the top first.

59:23.326 --> 59:25.662
-Go score those points!
-He has to get them.

59:25.728 --> 59:30.567
-Stretch your leg! Come on!
-Come on! Come on!

59:30.633 --> 59:32.268
Is he not going for the points?

59:32.335 --> 59:33.937
What's wrong, Miguel?

59:34.771 --> 59:38.141
[Tiki] You see that Miguel Espada
has one of those pegs in his mouth.

59:38.207 --> 59:41.277
-[Chris] Why?
-[Tiki] To use in case his arms get tired.

59:41.344 --> 59:44.180
He can plant it below him,
and have a foothold.

59:44.247 --> 59:47.817
[Chris] Whoa! That was a smart tactic,
to have the peg in your mouth.

59:51.788 --> 59:56.326
[Tiki] But it almost doesn't matter
as Haibin Qu flew up the Motherboard.

59:56.392 --> 59:59.429
Wow! This is his climbing experience
coming in handy.

59:59.495 --> 01:00:00.330
Clear the level.

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.265
Haibin Qu, what are you?

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:03.366
Are you a gecko

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.801
or are you Spider-Man?

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.369
How can you climb so fast?

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:09.639
[Tiki] Haibin Qu
is about to start on Sky Hook.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:16.813
We saw in Level 3
how strong Haibin Qu's grip is.

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:20.783
It's almost as if
he could hang there indefinitely.

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:23.886
[cheering]

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:32.428
[Tiki] Miguel Espada is now struggling

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:36.099
for the last few feet of the Motherboard.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.303
Haibin Qu has such pride in what he does.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.638
You've got to commend him.

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:45.608
This is his climbing expertise
making it look easy.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:48.378
Wow. 30 seconds to get to the top.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:51.180
[Chris] Haibin Qu, taking his time.

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:52.148
[cheering]

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:55.385
[Tiki] Miguel Espada,
he's trying not to give up but...

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:57.654
And he falls!

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.989
No! No! No!

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:02.458
[Chris] And the Spanish stuntman
is saying, "no más."

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.927
[Tiki] That's a long fall down.

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.230
And he's conceding.

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:08.698
He's waving, "No!"

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:11.634
Now it's all on Haibin Qu.

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:14.771
He's only got 15 seconds
to reach the top.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:18.074
Can he find the energy
for one final push?

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:22.445
Wow! Haibin Qu
making the ultimate statement right here!

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:25.214
[Chris] And Haibin Qu gets it!

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.117
[Tiki] Wow, that was impressive.

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:31.654
[Chris] Haibin Qu is our Beastmaster

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.990
and Miguel Espada gets nada.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.897
Wow! Standing atop the Ventilator.

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:44.133
You're the greatest Beastmaster!

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:49.639
[Tiki] 665 points for Haibin Qu,

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.408
dominating Miguel Espada.

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:53.342
[Chris] Wow.

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:55.211
[Tiki] And finishing Level 4.

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:57.447
He'll go on to face the other winners

01:01:57.513 --> 01:02:01.984
for a chance to be crowned
the Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:05.121
[cheering]

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:10.626
The championship is mine. I won it.
I'm the strongest competitor.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.103
[Tiki] I can't wait to see
who can top that.

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:23.573
Another epic battle of Beastmaster.

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:27.343
Twelve new competitors take it on, next.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.780
