WEBVTT

00:03.596 --> 00:05.030
So this year, none of the stores

00:05.032 --> 00:06.898
will have strolling Easter Bunnies,

00:06.900 --> 00:08.533
because last year
they kept getting jumped

00:08.535 --> 00:10.101
by gangs of teenagers.

00:10.103 --> 00:11.970
You all saw the YouTube videos.

00:11.972 --> 00:13.338
Oh, yeah.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.873
- So much anger.
- Hilarious.

00:14.874 --> 00:16.829
Spring frozen yogurt flavors, check.

00:16.830 --> 00:18.670
New daily email, check.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.651
No bunny characters, check.

00:21.028 --> 00:22.635
Glenn, you had an announcement.

00:22.636 --> 00:23.465
Yeah.

00:24.484 --> 00:25.628
Thank you, Amy.

00:25.629 --> 00:27.371
Uh, I just wanted to remind you all

00:27.372 --> 00:30.240
that I'm acting my church's
Passion play tonight.

00:30.242 --> 00:32.342
It's just a little part,
Villager Number Four.

00:32.628 --> 00:34.361
I'm trying to do things
that are kind of

00:34.363 --> 00:35.755
outside my comfort zone.

00:35.755 --> 00:37.655
Like, last week I tried hummus,

00:38.706 --> 00:40.525
and, I'm sorry, I'm not a fan.

00:40.527 --> 00:42.794
- Oh, do you think that I'm...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:42.796 --> 00:45.530
Or that hummus is...
Thank you for trying it.

00:45.633 --> 00:48.667
Okay, anyway,
I need to get a head count

00:48.669 --> 00:50.169
so I know who's coming.

00:50.731 --> 00:52.571
All right... oh, no,
could you keep your hands up

00:52.573 --> 00:53.813
until I get you all?

00:53.834 --> 00:54.413
So...

00:55.876 --> 00:56.614
Anyone?

00:57.445 --> 00:59.211
Cheyenne, you...

00:59.213 --> 01:01.180
Oh, um, well,

01:01.182 --> 01:03.349
I have another Passion play,

01:03.351 --> 01:04.816
but I'll try to swing by.

01:04.819 --> 01:05.884
Garrett.

01:05.886 --> 01:07.419
Uh, same.

01:07.421 --> 01:09.388
I mean, there's just...

01:09.390 --> 01:11.631
you know, this time of year,
there's so many.

01:11.632 --> 01:12.632
I'm free tonight.

01:12.633 --> 01:14.193
I was actually looking
for something to do.

01:14.195 --> 01:16.337
But that sounds truly awful, so no.

01:16.339 --> 01:18.806
Okay, so no one. All right, well...

01:19.760 --> 01:20.764
I guess I could go.

01:20.765 --> 01:22.562
Oh, well, only if you want to.

01:22.563 --> 01:23.896
I mean, don't do it just for me,

01:23.897 --> 01:25.561
'cause, you know, it is a big church.

01:25.562 --> 01:27.896
I probably won't even
know that you're there.

01:29.937 --> 01:32.037
- I can go after the other one.
- I'm good.

01:39.939 --> 01:41.555
Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers.

01:41.556 --> 01:42.589
Easter is upon us.

01:42.591 --> 01:45.925
So treat your kids
to a Cloud 9 Easter basket,

01:45.927 --> 01:49.429
full of candy, toys and HDMI cables,

01:49.431 --> 01:50.730
because we had an overstock.

01:50.732 --> 01:52.065
Happy Easter.

01:52.067 --> 01:54.216
Behold, he is...

01:55.904 --> 01:58.238
a-aroused?

01:58.240 --> 01:59.272
A raisin?

01:59.274 --> 02:01.241
Risen. He is risen.

02:01.243 --> 02:03.143
Risen. God, brain fart.

02:03.638 --> 02:04.970
This is hard.

02:05.091 --> 02:06.807
Acting is hard.

02:06.808 --> 02:08.300
Blake Lively always says that.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.901
Well, he's right.

02:09.902 --> 02:11.769
- It's a lot of pressure.
- Just relax.

02:11.771 --> 02:14.606
- It's supposed to be fun.
- Yeah.

02:14.608 --> 02:16.474
Speaking of the play.

02:16.862 --> 02:18.552
Hello, Deacon. Yeah.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.515
Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.

02:25.080 --> 02:25.811
Okay.

02:26.753 --> 02:27.832
Okay.

02:28.188 --> 02:30.154
Thank you for calling. Bye.

02:30.156 --> 02:31.431
Bad news?

02:32.884 --> 02:36.361
Yeah, Scott Bankroft broke his leg.

02:36.853 --> 02:39.497
And now I'm playing the role of Judas.

02:39.499 --> 02:42.133
- Judas Iscariot!
- Yeah, we know who Judas is.

02:42.135 --> 02:44.235
Son of Cyborea and Simon Iscariot.

02:44.237 --> 02:45.737
That I did not know.

02:46.302 --> 02:49.157
No, Denise, I did not steal
your "Roswell" DVDs,

02:49.158 --> 02:51.363
and even if I did,
you have no appreciation

02:51.364 --> 02:52.700
for New Mexican culture.

02:53.603 --> 02:54.969
What the hell?

02:55.331 --> 02:56.379
I'll call you back.

02:56.685 --> 02:57.492
No, I won't.

02:58.267 --> 02:59.266
Amy!

03:00.469 --> 03:02.347
Amy! Amy Sosa!

03:02.434 --> 03:04.438
I don't like yelling, Dina.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.351
Then come over here!

03:07.409 --> 03:08.598
I thought you said we weren't having

03:08.599 --> 03:10.244
- an Easter Bunny this year.
- We're not.

03:10.245 --> 03:11.974
Well, then why is this guy walking...

03:13.215 --> 03:15.649
Huh. He must have gone into
a different part of the store.

03:15.651 --> 03:16.805
Hold on, I'll find him.

03:18.020 --> 03:18.860
Wait, hold on.

03:18.861 --> 03:21.154
We have cameras in the break room?

03:21.156 --> 03:23.657
Yeah, yeah, it's hidden in
the smoke alarm in the corner.

03:23.659 --> 03:25.177
Is that legal?

03:25.178 --> 03:27.327
Uh, it's in a gray area.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.796
Wait, what is he... what is he doing?

03:29.798 --> 03:31.031
Is that...

03:31.418 --> 03:32.866
Is that supposed to be me?

03:32.868 --> 03:34.059
Do you want to hear
what they're saying?

03:34.703 --> 03:36.974
You have audio? Is that legal?

03:38.173 --> 03:39.778
Do you want to hear
what they're saying?

03:43.112 --> 03:46.446
Check. Go on for too long, check.

03:46.448 --> 03:49.950
Oh, bring in stale donuts,
checkity-check.

03:49.952 --> 03:51.423
Nailed it.

03:51.424 --> 03:53.053
No, I have never said "checkity-check."

03:53.055 --> 03:54.154
She doesn't even realize

03:54.156 --> 03:55.856
she's making the check mark backwards.

03:55.858 --> 03:59.092
No, it's the right way
from my point of view, Carol.

03:59.094 --> 04:01.061
I'm not an aerobics instructor.

04:01.063 --> 04:03.096
Oh, honey, I don't think anyone

04:03.098 --> 04:04.631
thinks you're an aerobics instructor.

04:04.633 --> 04:06.733
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:06.735 --> 04:09.803
Oh, my God, this is a huge part.

04:09.805 --> 04:12.105
This is too much pressure.

04:12.107 --> 04:14.074
Well, at least they're
letting you hold the script

04:14.076 --> 04:15.442
during the play,

04:15.444 --> 04:17.493
and you're really good
at holding things.

04:17.494 --> 04:19.880
Yeah, but I don't know how
to play a villain.

04:19.882 --> 04:20.814
I'm a nice guy.

04:20.815 --> 04:22.950
Even so, I mean, there must be sometime

04:22.952 --> 04:25.118
in your life where
you did something bad

04:25.120 --> 04:26.586
that you could tap into.

04:26.588 --> 04:29.189
Once I was bringing Dippin' Dots home

04:29.191 --> 04:30.691
for me and Jerusha,

04:30.693 --> 04:33.293
and I told her that
a homeless man had eaten hers,

04:33.295 --> 04:34.761
but really I ate both of them.

04:35.462 --> 04:37.664
That's the worst thing
you've ever done?

04:39.238 --> 04:41.181
And I guess there was this other time

04:41.182 --> 04:43.663
when my friend Wesley in Sunday School

04:43.664 --> 04:44.883
told me that he was gay,

04:44.884 --> 04:46.691
and I promised that
I wouldn't say anything,

04:46.692 --> 04:48.154
but as soon as he left the room,

04:48.155 --> 04:50.347
I ran and I told Deacon Jeremy,

04:50.349 --> 04:51.788
and then he had to spend
the rest of the year

04:51.789 --> 04:53.050
in a special camp.

04:53.052 --> 04:55.272
- Oh, dude, that's messed.
- Yeah, use that.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:04.564 --> 05:05.480
Excuse me.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.052
Hey!

05:07.633 --> 05:08.430
Hey!

05:13.840 --> 05:16.173
Hey, Sandra, did you see
a large Easter Bunny

05:16.175 --> 05:18.242
- walk past just now?
- What did he look like?

05:18.243 --> 05:20.044
A man-sized rabbit, Sandra.

05:20.046 --> 05:21.779
Two large ears, cottontail,

05:21.781 --> 05:23.080
capable of walking on his hind feet

05:23.082 --> 05:24.615
while using his front feet like hands.

05:24.617 --> 05:26.264
Why do I need to describe this to you?

05:26.265 --> 05:28.586
No, I didn't, but did see a zucchini

05:28.588 --> 05:30.154
that looked a lot like a cucumber,

05:30.155 --> 05:32.856
and I thought, whoa, that
could really mess up dinner.

05:32.859 --> 05:33.964
How is that helpful to me?

05:34.151 --> 05:36.026
Look, we have to find this bunny.

05:36.028 --> 05:38.329
Is it that big a deal
what someone dressed up

05:38.331 --> 05:39.964
as an Easter Bunny on Easter?

05:39.966 --> 05:42.048
It could be a serial killer, Sandra.

05:42.128 --> 05:43.768
Or a terrorist. Or a spy.

05:43.770 --> 05:46.203
So if you see him, call me
on the walkie immediately.

05:46.205 --> 05:47.271
Code Cottontail.

05:47.273 --> 05:48.439
You got it.

05:48.441 --> 05:50.007
What if I see another zucumber?

05:50.407 --> 05:52.510
That's what I call a zucchini
that looks like a cucumber.

05:52.512 --> 05:53.377
I'd like to meet your mother

05:53.379 --> 05:55.179
and shove you back up inside of her.

05:55.181 --> 05:56.284
Yeah.

05:58.968 --> 06:01.268
Hey, so I couldn't find the movie "Hop"

06:01.270 --> 06:02.837
to put on the TV in Electronics,

06:02.839 --> 06:04.405
so I just put in "Fatal Attraction,"

06:04.407 --> 06:05.272
'cause it has a bunny.

06:05.274 --> 06:07.708
Okay, well, that's taken care of.

06:07.710 --> 06:08.319
Check.

06:10.279 --> 06:11.879
Don't always have to do
that check thing.

06:11.881 --> 06:13.247
It's kinda stupid.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.335
What? No, I love it.

06:16.195 --> 06:17.327
Do you?

06:17.329 --> 06:19.830
Yeah, you know, it's fun, it's cool,

06:20.195 --> 06:20.916
it's very you.

06:21.556 --> 06:22.379
Mm-hmm.

06:29.971 --> 06:31.327
Okay, bye.

06:34.442 --> 06:35.575
He coulda just been like,

06:35.702 --> 06:38.541
"Amy, those little air check
things you do are stupid."

06:38.598 --> 06:40.351
But instead,
he mocks me behind my back.

06:40.352 --> 06:42.319
Are you allowed to videotape
people without their knowledge?

06:42.321 --> 06:43.820
It's a gray area.

06:43.822 --> 06:45.188
And then to my face he was all like,

06:45.190 --> 06:47.390
"I love it." Like totally lies.

06:47.392 --> 06:49.826
And I just wanted to be like,
"I heard you, you dick."

06:49.828 --> 06:51.461
Also, if that's not
a functioning smoke alarm,

06:51.463 --> 06:53.605
- what happens if there's a fire?
- Will you focus?

06:53.606 --> 06:55.131
It's just not really a big deal.

06:55.133 --> 06:56.015
You're the boss now.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.712
Of course people talk
about you behind your back.

06:58.370 --> 06:59.369
- Well...
- What?

06:59.371 --> 07:00.370
- Like what?
- Hmm?

07:00.912 --> 07:02.007
Who talks about me?

07:02.008 --> 07:02.640
What do they say?

07:02.641 --> 07:04.525
Nothing. It's an expression.

07:05.137 --> 07:07.208
"Of course people talk
about you behind your back"

07:07.209 --> 07:08.952
is an expression?

07:08.954 --> 07:10.895
It's just... forget it. It's nothing.

07:10.896 --> 07:12.412
No, no, I'm not mad about it.

07:12.413 --> 07:14.794
I'm curious, I think it
would be good for me to know.

07:14.795 --> 07:15.844
I could work on it.

07:15.845 --> 07:19.296
I mean, eh, if I racked my brain,

07:19.298 --> 07:22.499
I guess maybe I heard once
somebody say something like,

07:22.501 --> 07:24.893
uh, "I wish she would say
thank you more," you know?

07:24.894 --> 07:26.837
- I say thank you all the time.
- I know.

07:26.839 --> 07:28.234
I'm, like, always saying
thank you, like, too much.

07:28.235 --> 07:29.459
Yeah, that's what I said.

07:29.460 --> 07:30.479
- Yeah, exactly.
- Who said it?

07:31.477 --> 07:32.209
Nobody.

07:32.211 --> 07:34.111
Nobody? Somebody said it.

07:34.113 --> 07:36.246
You know what, I misspoke.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.882
Uh, what I meant to say is
whenever you leave a room,

07:38.884 --> 07:41.218
we all just sit in respectful silence.

07:43.188 --> 07:46.160
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.959
If it makes you feel any better,

07:48.961 --> 07:51.595
they just make fun of me
openly to my face.

07:58.398 --> 08:00.337
30 pieces of silver. It is done.

08:00.831 --> 08:02.764
30 pieces of silver.

08:02.766 --> 08:04.266
30 pieces of silver.

08:04.268 --> 08:06.301
Okay, you know what, let's
just forget the lines, okay?

08:06.303 --> 08:08.804
Forget the lines. Who is Judas?

08:08.806 --> 08:10.806
He's the disciple that betrayed Jesus.

08:10.808 --> 08:12.507
Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody knows that.

08:12.509 --> 08:14.342
But who is he?

08:14.344 --> 08:15.877
Let's do a little role play, okay?

08:15.879 --> 08:17.047
- You be Judas.
- Mm-hmm.

08:17.101 --> 08:19.147
- And I'll be Judas's friend.
- Oh, uh, Peter.

08:19.149 --> 08:21.349
Great, I'll be Peter. You're Judas.

08:21.351 --> 08:24.152
It's not Easter.
We're not talking Jesus.

08:24.154 --> 08:25.454
- Yeah.
- We're just two dudes

08:25.456 --> 08:27.527
hanging out in Jerusalem cutting it up.

08:27.528 --> 08:29.367
Okay, oh, um...

08:29.793 --> 08:31.571
Oh, uh, hey, Peter.

08:32.246 --> 08:35.397
Do you want to go down to
the spice market in Bethlehem?

08:35.399 --> 08:37.325
Whoa, Judas, why is
your penis hanging out?

08:37.326 --> 08:38.633
Wha... no, it's not.

08:38.635 --> 08:40.321
You have to say
yes and go along with it.

08:40.322 --> 08:42.471
Oh, oh, uh, okay.

08:42.472 --> 08:44.739
Uh, I just wanted you to see it.

08:44.741 --> 08:45.907
Judas, we've talked about this,

08:45.909 --> 08:48.877
and I know Brad has pulled
you aside and told you to stop.

08:48.879 --> 08:50.679
It's not cool, it's not funny,

08:50.681 --> 08:52.681
and it's starting to make
people uncomfortable.

08:52.683 --> 08:54.082
Oh, okay.

08:54.084 --> 08:57.085
- Well, then I'll put it away.
- Thank you.

08:57.087 --> 09:00.077
Now, can I interest you
in some figs or some dates?

09:00.078 --> 09:01.791
Judas, why is your penis out again?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.859
Well, I thought I put it away.

09:03.861 --> 09:05.060
Well, obviously you didn't.

09:05.062 --> 09:06.695
'Cause there it is right in my face.

09:06.697 --> 09:07.996
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

09:07.998 --> 09:09.097
Now get out of my hovel!

09:09.099 --> 09:10.198
Oh, okay.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.102
I'll get on my donkey and ride.

09:14.104 --> 09:15.871
That's not a donkey. That's a rock.

09:15.873 --> 09:16.741
But I said it was a donkey.

09:16.742 --> 09:18.235
You're wrong. It's a rock.

09:22.379 --> 09:24.880
It's like 1980 called and they said,

09:24.882 --> 09:27.048
"Shoulder pad, party of two."

09:27.050 --> 09:28.583
Bad blazers, got it.

09:28.585 --> 09:30.285
You have got to stop watching this.

09:30.287 --> 09:31.786
You're gonna drive yourself crazy.

09:31.788 --> 09:32.787
No, no, no, it's good.

09:32.789 --> 09:35.190
I've actually learned
quite a bit about myself,

09:35.192 --> 09:37.893
aside from the complete
lack of fashion sense,

09:37.895 --> 09:39.794
I don't make enough eye contact,

09:39.796 --> 09:41.630
my voice can be shrill,

09:41.632 --> 09:44.052
my walking stride is too long,

09:44.053 --> 09:47.235
and when I talk, I move
my hands more than an Italian.

09:47.237 --> 09:48.937
This can't be legal.

09:48.939 --> 09:50.205
It's a gray area.

09:50.207 --> 09:53.074
You know "gray area" doesn't
just mean totally fine, right?

09:53.076 --> 09:54.409
It's not like running a yellow light.

09:54.411 --> 09:56.077
You would think that
with everything going on

09:56.079 --> 09:57.145
in the world, there were
more important things

09:57.147 --> 09:59.114
- to talk about than my...
- Wait, wait, shh, shh.

09:59.116 --> 10:00.982
Actually, I think
Jonah's shirt is pretty cool.

10:00.984 --> 10:02.884
It's a big swing, but works for him.

10:02.886 --> 10:03.258
Huh.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.788
It's just Garrett just never
really compliments me.

10:07.991 --> 10:10.258
It's nice. Doesn't matter.

10:10.594 --> 10:11.972
Nope, it doesn't matter.

10:13.830 --> 10:17.335
Crazy thing is this isn't
even one of my premium shirts.

10:18.254 --> 10:19.813
Attention, Cloud 9 customers.

10:19.814 --> 10:22.990
Please be on the lookout for
a six-foot-tall Easter Bunny.

10:22.992 --> 10:25.626
White fur, cottontail, plaid bowtie.

10:25.628 --> 10:26.661
He's been spotted in the vicinity.

10:26.663 --> 10:28.729
Ooh, did you hear that?
The Easter Bunny's here.

10:28.730 --> 10:30.467
- Let's meet him.
- No. No, no, no.

10:30.468 --> 10:31.544
Absolutely not.

10:31.545 --> 10:33.672
This bunny should be
considered dangerous,

10:33.673 --> 10:35.762
possibly armed, likely a pedophile.

10:36.272 --> 10:38.843
Also if anyone would like
to offer their child as bait,

10:38.844 --> 10:39.938
please let me know.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.721
I have a doll I use,
but obviously there's

10:41.722 --> 10:43.290
no substitute for the real thing.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.653
As of now, I don't know
the bunny's preferences,

10:45.782 --> 10:47.275
so I'll take a blonde and a brunette.

10:47.276 --> 10:49.029
No redheads, obviously.

10:49.452 --> 10:50.316
They're gross.

10:58.895 --> 10:59.609
This, uh...

11:00.530 --> 11:02.545
This shirt comes in two colors.

11:03.066 --> 11:05.294
Think I might have picked
the wrong one, you know?

11:05.295 --> 11:06.783
What do you think? It's a little loud.

11:06.784 --> 11:08.464
- Don't you think?
- I don't know.

11:10.192 --> 11:11.977
Maybe... maybe I should
just get rid of it.

11:12.288 --> 11:14.122
Just give it away, 'cause it's like...

11:14.184 --> 11:17.251
it's like, is this really a good shirt?

11:18.030 --> 11:20.676
What would you think about me
just getting rid of this shirt?

11:20.677 --> 11:21.693
Do what you want.

11:22.090 --> 11:22.709
Huh.

11:23.305 --> 11:24.938
Okay, okay.

11:25.221 --> 11:27.021
So if I never wore this shirt again,

11:27.023 --> 11:27.889
that would be cool with you?

11:27.891 --> 11:29.412
I don't know what you're asking me.

11:29.413 --> 11:31.450
Nothing. I'm not asking anything.

11:31.451 --> 11:32.455
I was just saying,

11:32.456 --> 11:35.234
I think I might get rid of this shirt.

11:35.235 --> 11:36.072
Okay.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.912
It's just that we have
to finish these baskets

11:38.028 --> 11:39.328
- or we can't go home.
- Yeah, yeah, great.

11:39.349 --> 11:40.881
No, that's what I'm doing. Great, yeah.

11:40.970 --> 11:42.236
Let's... let's finish these baskets.

11:42.238 --> 11:43.571
Let's go, let's go.

11:56.311 --> 11:57.916
Hey, guys,
how's it going over here?

11:59.122 --> 12:01.756
Good. Are you sick?

12:01.758 --> 12:05.259
No, no,
but thank you for asking.

12:05.590 --> 12:08.986
The, uh, Easter decorations
all look really great.

12:10.215 --> 12:12.093
I particularly like the end cap

12:14.285 --> 12:15.451
over yonder.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.600
Well, you all did a great job.

12:17.602 --> 12:19.236
Cheyenne, thank you.

12:19.885 --> 12:21.818
Mateo, thank you.

12:21.987 --> 12:23.826
Sayid, thank you.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.262
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:25.263 --> 12:25.938
Thank you.

12:27.526 --> 12:29.135
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, thank you.

12:29.588 --> 12:30.365
Thank you.

12:36.950 --> 12:38.677
I think she [bleep] her pants.

12:39.624 --> 12:41.324
Ohh.

12:41.660 --> 12:43.326
Hello, Jesus.

12:43.995 --> 12:45.099
Oh, Jesus.

12:45.697 --> 12:47.130
Hey, Jesus.

12:47.132 --> 12:49.165
Jesus of Nazareth.

12:49.167 --> 12:50.451
Papers please.

12:50.452 --> 12:52.137
I said, are you looking at me?

12:52.338 --> 12:53.904
'Cause you... oh.

12:54.372 --> 12:56.334
Calm down, Glenn. Calm down.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.273
So she's all, "No, the nice girl"

13:08.274 --> 13:09.474
from the Bradley Cooper movie,"

13:09.475 --> 13:11.321
and I'm like, "That is Lady Gaga."

13:11.323 --> 13:14.023
Your grandma's
such a basic bitch.

13:14.025 --> 13:16.559
Hey, have you guys noticed
Amy's acting weird today?

13:16.561 --> 13:18.248
Totally. What's with the voice?

13:18.249 --> 13:19.724
She's all, "Thank you, Mateo."

13:19.725 --> 13:22.052
I mean, it's totally working,
but also super random.

13:22.053 --> 13:23.571
What is she eating, cigars?

13:23.572 --> 13:27.723
I had the craziest customer
come up to me this morning.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.575
Also, what's with
the weirdly intimate stares?

13:30.576 --> 13:32.964
Did I tell you about
the time she high-fived me

13:32.965 --> 13:34.670
and interlocked fingers?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.400
I felt so violated.

13:36.401 --> 13:37.693
Oh, but have you guys noticed

13:37.694 --> 13:39.695
how well she's been running
things around here?

13:39.696 --> 13:41.584
Like, we all knew she was
gonna be good at the job,

13:41.585 --> 13:43.381
but it's been crazy.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.487
Why do you keep looking
at the smoke alarm?

13:47.959 --> 13:48.547
I'm not.

13:49.227 --> 13:50.757
She's not running things that well.

13:50.758 --> 13:51.687
Oh, you know what I realized?

13:51.688 --> 13:53.717
We never had a moment of silence

13:53.718 --> 13:56.151
for the guy who created SpongeBob.

13:56.153 --> 13:57.606
So do you want to do that now?

13:57.607 --> 13:59.740
Guys, he obviously doesn't want us

13:59.741 --> 14:01.374
talking about his girlfriend
in front of him.

14:01.376 --> 14:02.949
Since when? Last week he was saying

14:02.950 --> 14:06.200
how when she goes for a run,
she looks like Frankenstein.

14:07.749 --> 14:08.949
What? No.

14:08.951 --> 14:10.217
That wasn't me.

14:10.219 --> 14:11.503
I don't even know
who you're thinking of.

14:11.504 --> 14:13.220
Yeah, you were all like,

14:13.222 --> 14:16.890
"Me Amy. Me prep for 5K."

14:16.892 --> 14:19.292
That does not even sound like me.

14:19.294 --> 14:21.461
"Running hard, water bad."

14:21.463 --> 14:23.630
"Me get shin splints. Ohhh!"

14:23.632 --> 14:25.432
Can everybody just shut the [bleep] up

14:25.434 --> 14:26.800
so we can enjoy our break?

14:29.738 --> 14:30.549
Thank you.

14:40.282 --> 14:43.185
Ugh, Amy's making me stay
after to do back stock.

14:43.306 --> 14:45.172
She's, like, super grumpy today.

14:45.174 --> 14:47.007
She's a real grumplestiltskin.

14:47.009 --> 14:48.309
Did I use that right?

14:48.311 --> 14:49.343
- Mm-hmm.
- You did, yeah.

14:49.345 --> 14:51.545
What is up with her lately?
She's so uptight.

14:51.547 --> 14:53.994
Yeah, well, she's about
to chill the F out.

14:54.168 --> 14:56.550
I had some ecstasy left over
from St. Patrick's Day,

14:56.552 --> 14:58.219
so I put some in her coffee.

14:58.221 --> 15:00.921
- Oh, no.
- What the hell?

15:02.258 --> 15:03.924
- She deserves it.
- Oh, good for you.

15:03.926 --> 15:05.192
You drugged me?

15:05.194 --> 15:07.277
What the hell is wrong with you?

15:08.164 --> 15:09.980
Oh, my God,
my heart is beating so fast.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.541
Oh, how much did you give me?

15:12.742 --> 15:14.735
None, bitch. You caught.

15:14.737 --> 15:16.036
Yeah.

15:19.490 --> 15:21.157
Great job on these baskets, man.

15:21.159 --> 15:23.025
You really knocked
that one out of the park.

15:23.027 --> 15:25.272
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, you know.

15:25.740 --> 15:28.564
Just, you know, throwing
out a compliment as one does.

15:28.566 --> 15:29.678
So mm-hmm.

15:30.401 --> 15:31.303
Cool shoes.

15:32.170 --> 15:32.899
Thanks.

15:33.007 --> 15:35.504
Yeah, they're Jordan 11 Retro Concords.

15:35.506 --> 15:38.882
What? Those are so dope, son.

15:38.883 --> 15:39.886
I love them.

15:40.912 --> 15:42.912
Huh? What's... I'm sorry, I missed...

15:42.914 --> 15:45.481
- I missed that.
- I didn't say anything.

15:45.483 --> 15:47.895
Oh, I thought you said
something about me.

15:47.896 --> 15:48.619
I did not.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.353
Ah, okay, well...

15:51.689 --> 15:53.923
Mm, you smell nice. Is that, uh...

15:53.925 --> 15:55.654
Is that like a new... What is that?

15:58.729 --> 16:00.930
Where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?

16:00.932 --> 16:03.564
Ah, I'm gonna find you,
you stupid bunny.

16:13.177 --> 16:16.412
Hey, cutie.

16:16.414 --> 16:17.546
Shh.

16:17.548 --> 16:18.781
Carol might be around.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.950
No, she's outside vaping.

16:20.952 --> 16:22.451
I told you we could spend
the day together

16:22.453 --> 16:23.286
without her knowing.

16:23.287 --> 16:24.642
Well, be careful.

16:24.643 --> 16:26.055
Dina's looking for you too.

16:26.057 --> 16:28.457
She thinks you're some kind
of sex bunny.

16:28.459 --> 16:30.799
Well, maybe I am.

16:34.111 --> 16:35.460
Let's go to the photo lab.

16:38.636 --> 16:40.690
Would you mind putting
the head back on?

16:41.871 --> 16:43.002
It's kind of a fantasy.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.369
Yes.

16:48.479 --> 16:50.220
I can't believe you were spying on us.

16:50.221 --> 16:51.291
That is so illegal.

16:51.292 --> 16:53.282
No, actually it's not illegal.

16:53.284 --> 16:56.485
Eh, it's a gray area.
So perfectly fine.

16:56.487 --> 16:58.353
Are we sure this is the last one?

16:58.354 --> 17:00.531
I don't know. Dina's the one
who put them everywhere.

17:00.532 --> 17:03.125
Yeah, Amy was just
the one sitting watching us

17:03.127 --> 17:04.827
in the dark without our consent.

17:04.829 --> 17:06.662
No, all the lights were on.

17:06.664 --> 17:08.897
Maybe I should take down
all the smoke detectors,

17:08.900 --> 17:09.932
you know, just to be safe.

17:09.934 --> 17:12.268
Yes, that's definitely
the safest thing to do.

17:12.270 --> 17:15.232
What other private areas
do you spy on us in?

17:15.233 --> 17:16.839
Are there cameras in the bathroom?

17:16.839 --> 17:19.496
Oh, my God, are you
watching us masturbate at work?

17:19.497 --> 17:21.002
Uh... no.

17:21.003 --> 17:24.113
And you shouldn't be
masturbating at work.

17:24.115 --> 17:25.790
Then how do you know I'm doing it?

17:26.284 --> 17:27.483
I'm good, thanks.

17:27.484 --> 17:29.042
I'm not the bad guy here.

17:29.043 --> 17:30.674
You're the ones who have
been sitting in here,

17:30.675 --> 17:32.621
talking about me behind my back.

17:32.623 --> 17:33.489
If you have something to say,

17:33.491 --> 17:34.823
why don't you just say it to my face?

17:34.825 --> 17:35.858
Yeah, that goes for everyone.

17:35.860 --> 17:39.461
If you have an opinion
about someone, tell them,

17:39.463 --> 17:41.130
bad or good.

17:41.132 --> 17:43.198
Who goes around saying
good things about people

17:43.200 --> 17:43.966
behind their backs?

17:43.968 --> 17:45.657
That's a really good question.

17:45.658 --> 17:47.169
Garrett, do you have
any thoughts about that?

17:47.171 --> 17:48.270
No, not really.

17:48.272 --> 17:50.806
We were talking about you
because you're the boss.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.714
Everyone complains about the boss.

17:52.715 --> 17:55.502
Wait, did you guys used
to say things about me

17:55.503 --> 17:56.783
when I was the boss?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.047
No.

17:58.049 --> 18:00.352
It's just something
we started doing recently.

18:00.353 --> 18:02.184
Oh, okay. Good.

18:02.186 --> 18:03.819
So when we do need to masturbate,

18:03.821 --> 18:05.154
where are we supposed to go?

18:05.156 --> 18:07.357
I don't know, maybe hold it?

18:07.358 --> 18:09.641
- You can go to your car.
- Loading dock.

18:09.642 --> 18:11.226
Milk aisle.

18:11.228 --> 18:13.195
There's a nook in the
Garden Center that's good.

18:13.197 --> 18:14.173
Or hell.

18:15.132 --> 18:18.087
Oh, where are you?
Where are you? Where are you?

18:18.088 --> 18:19.338
Oh! Gotcha!

18:20.638 --> 18:22.037
Sandra, Code Cottontail.

18:22.039 --> 18:23.739
I repeat, Code Cottontail.

18:23.741 --> 18:25.074
- What was that?
- The rabbit.

18:25.076 --> 18:26.491
Turn around. He's right there.

18:28.345 --> 18:31.046
Uh... I don't see him.

18:31.182 --> 18:33.182
Are you serious? The large rabbit.

18:33.184 --> 18:34.885
It's right there, you could
reach out and touch him.

18:34.886 --> 18:36.852
He's right there! The white guy!

18:36.854 --> 18:40.522
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you see on the camera,

18:41.025 --> 18:43.492
but there's nothing here.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.237
Ahh!

18:54.115 --> 18:55.282
Hey, Dina.

18:55.284 --> 18:57.293
I was about to leave
for Glenn's show and...

18:57.953 --> 18:59.706
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

19:00.589 --> 19:02.260
Oh, uh, I, uh...

19:03.392 --> 19:04.124
I don't know.

19:04.499 --> 19:06.017
I think I might be going crazy.

19:06.662 --> 19:08.562
Do you think I could be going crazy?

19:08.564 --> 19:09.311
No.

19:10.518 --> 19:13.152
I mean, I guess it's possible.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.587
You have been working
really hard lately.

19:16.038 --> 19:17.604
Plus, you went through the trauma

19:17.606 --> 19:19.227
of losing all your birds.

19:19.228 --> 19:20.793
You're seeing giant bunnies.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.929
Yeah, actually,

19:24.613 --> 19:25.918
you might be going crazy.

19:27.248 --> 19:28.038
I'm sorry.

19:30.218 --> 19:31.487
See you at Glenn's show.

19:49.305 --> 19:51.371
So full HD is all
you're really gonna need.

19:51.373 --> 19:53.240
- You get into Ultra HD...
- Hey, man.

19:53.242 --> 19:54.614
I know you like this shirt,

19:54.615 --> 19:55.709
and I think it's pretty messed up

19:55.711 --> 19:57.338
that you won't say
nice things to my face.

19:57.339 --> 19:58.421
It's not hard.

19:58.422 --> 19:59.646
I think you're a good cook,

19:59.648 --> 20:01.615
and you have a pretty
decent singing voice.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.093
And I think it's sweet how you
call your grandma every day.

20:04.094 --> 20:05.981
There, see, was that so hard?

20:09.091 --> 20:11.713
It's fine, we're cool.
He's my best friend.

20:12.707 --> 20:14.006
- Desperate.
- Desperate.

20:14.229 --> 20:15.896
I feel so sorry for her.

20:16.545 --> 20:17.898
Hey, gang.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.132
Hi, Amy.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.667
We were just talking about the weather.

20:20.669 --> 20:22.069
Oh, great.

20:22.071 --> 20:24.471
Look, um, you were all right.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.458
I should not have been watching you,

20:26.459 --> 20:27.874
and that was weird,

20:27.876 --> 20:31.071
and I know everybody needs
to vent about the boss

20:31.072 --> 20:32.968
and that it isn't anything personal,

20:32.969 --> 20:35.482
so please accept my apology.

20:35.975 --> 20:38.585
Yeah, well, maybe we were
being a little catty.

20:38.587 --> 20:40.253
I mean, most of what we said was good.

20:40.255 --> 20:41.855
You just didn't hear that part.

20:41.857 --> 20:43.323
Mm-hmm, okay.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.485
Well, let's just put it
behind us, you know?

20:45.486 --> 20:47.183
Case open and shut.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.998
So if anyone's heading over
to Glenn's Passion play,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.333
I can drive. I know how to get there.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.369
I've been before.

20:55.371 --> 20:56.536
Oh.

20:56.538 --> 20:58.011
What was that?

20:59.675 --> 21:00.224
What?

21:00.225 --> 21:02.809
Oh, just looked like you two
were texting each other

21:02.811 --> 21:03.844
something funny.

21:03.846 --> 21:04.878
Not each other.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.510
I don't even have his number.

21:06.511 --> 21:07.814
- Oh.
- My mom texted me

21:07.816 --> 21:08.882
a funny bitmoji.

21:08.884 --> 21:10.108
It's her jumping out of a pumpkin.

21:10.109 --> 21:12.467
- For Easter?
- Mm-hmm.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.935
That's how Filipinos celebrate Easter.

21:15.936 --> 21:17.469
Oh, that does sound funny. Can I see?

21:17.471 --> 21:18.737
Oh, I'd rather not.

21:18.739 --> 21:20.272
Oh, I just...
I'm just curious about it.

21:20.274 --> 21:21.062
It's embarrassing.

21:21.063 --> 21:22.329
No, well, why are you being
so weird about your phone?

21:22.330 --> 21:23.489
I'm not being weird.
You're being weird.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.131
- Mateo, just let me see it.
- No, stop, it's private. No!

21:28.975 --> 21:30.436
I told you to get a case.
