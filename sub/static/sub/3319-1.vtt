I think you'll find our...

Are you all right?

00:13.970 --> 00:16.451
Thanks for asking.

[sniffs]
It's very good.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.499
Yeah, 2004 was a great year
for this wine.

00:22.587 --> 00:23.893
Not so much for me.

So, did I talk you
into that soufflé?

00:35.165 --> 00:36.427
Uh, yeah, two.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.342
Good call.

you got a second?

I can't talk now, Gabriel.

Yeah, I know, but,
uh, here's the thing.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.315
I-I'm getting a lot
of complaints.

01:38.402 --> 01:39.360
Really?

01:39.447 --> 01:41.057
About what?

01:41.144 --> 01:43.059
Well, apparently,
one of my waitresses

01:43.146 --> 01:46.541
is having a nervous breakdown.

01:46.628 --> 01:47.107
Is it Jennifer?

No.

Is it Carol?

It's you!

01:54.418 --> 01:56.377
Gabriel, what does this
taste like to you?

01:57.465 --> 01:58.901
Uh, mushrooms?

01:58.988 --> 02:01.556
The correct answer was "ass."

02:04.254 --> 02:07.953
Listen, uh, maybe you should
take the rest of the night off.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.781
I can't afford to do that.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.609
I have children to feed.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.394
Not a problem. Grab a couple
steaks, head home and feed 'em.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.223
You don't understand.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.225
The guy at table four said
something horrible to me

02:18.312 --> 02:21.271
when I was telling him
about the salmon.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.359
What's wrong
with the salmon?

02:22.446 --> 02:23.186
Nothing, the salmon's great.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.319
The guy insulted me.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.364
Oh, that's fine.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.758
What did he say?

02:29.845 --> 02:31.325
He said I was...

02:31.412 --> 02:34.066
[sniffles]
a good waitress.

02:37.635 --> 02:38.897
That's not bad.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.073
Or true.
[groans]

02:41.161 --> 02:45.295
I didn't grow up to be
a "good waitress."

02:45.382 --> 02:46.644
That was never the plan.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.690
The plan was to be
a psychologist.

02:48.777 --> 02:49.734
Okay.

02:49.821 --> 02:50.648
You're a young woman.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.737
You can still do that.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.739
Yeah, maybe.

02:54.826 --> 02:55.653
I'd probably have to graduate

02:55.740 --> 02:57.089
high school first.

What did you say?

03:19.111 --> 03:21.766
Get over yourself, Rudy.

03:21.853 --> 03:25.117
I saw you at McDonald's
going down on a Big Mac.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.689
First of all,
it was a Filet-O-Fish.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.781
And for you?

03:36.868 --> 03:38.305
Um, I'd like the, uh...

03:38.392 --> 03:40.742
[studio audience cheering,

03:40.829 --> 03:42.439
I'd like the, uh,

03:42.526 --> 03:44.963
the pounded capon
with, uh, lemongrass and thyme.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.487
Excellent choice.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.822
Hi.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.780
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

05:02.867 --> 05:03.651
That's okay.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.000
How was work?

05:05.087 --> 05:06.262
Oh, fun.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.395
I feel guilty taking the money.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.789
What'd you do tonight?

05:11.876 --> 05:12.964
Not much.

05:13.051 --> 05:13.791
Did my homework, watched TV.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.010
Mmm.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.881
Is there a TV on your ceiling?

05:18.622 --> 05:19.275
What?

05:19.362 --> 05:21.886
Sit down.

05:21.973 --> 05:22.800
We need to talk.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.107
[sighs]

05:25.194 --> 05:28.110
What's up?

05:28.197 --> 05:31.635
Violet, I can't tell you...

05:31.722 --> 05:33.245
not to have sex at your age,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.509
because I had sex
at your age.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.511
Mom, I'm not having sex.[groans]

05:37.598 --> 05:40.731
Don't lie to the woman
who washes your sheets.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.387
And in case you've forgotten,

05:44.474 --> 05:45.867
I got pregnant with you
when I was a teenager.

05:45.954 --> 05:49.174
And please don't take
this the wrong way:

05:49.261 --> 05:51.525
It ruined my life.

05:51.612 --> 05:54.223
I love you, too, Mom...?

05:54.310 --> 05:57.661
And I can't tell you not
to drink and smoke pot,

05:57.748 --> 05:59.924
because my senior
yearbook quote was:

06:00.011 --> 06:02.840
"Let's drink and smoke pot."

06:02.927 --> 06:05.277
Can this please be over?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.062
You don't know
how lucky you are.

06:07.149 --> 06:09.107
My mother never bothered to
talk to me about this stuff.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.805
Yeah, this is over.Honey, I just don't want you

06:10.892 --> 06:12.154
to wake up one day and feel bad

06:12.241 --> 06:12.807
'cause you're not
a psychologist!

in your own bed.

Hi, Mom.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.211
Hi, sweetie.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.257

Thank you.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.217
Violet's boyfriend was over.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.568
I know.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.570
They were kissing.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.224
I'm sure they were.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.226
They took a shower together.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.448
Terrific.

06:45.535 --> 06:48.495
Are you coming to
my talent show tomorrow?

06:48.582 --> 06:50.061
Tomorrow?

06:50.148 --> 06:51.236
What time?

06:51.323 --> 06:52.890
11:00.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.240
Oh, honey, I have to
work the lunch shift.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.112

I'm not good anyway.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.509
Listen, maybe I can get
someone to cover my shift.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.555
Don't worry about it.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.775
No, I-I want you to be able
to look out into the audience

07:07.862 --> 07:10.038
and see me, because that way
you'll know how much I...

07:10.125 --> 07:12.519
Shh!
Mommy, I'm sleeping.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.436
Good talk.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.021
You feeling better?

07:37.108 --> 07:38.414
Oh, yeah.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.547
My home is a real oasis.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.376
So, am I in trouble
with Chef Rudy?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.466
He'll be fine.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.251
He bought an eight ball
and took home the pastry chef.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.122
Sleeping with your boss.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.254
Who does that?

Mom...?

07:57.433 --> 08:00.610
Yeah, honey?

08:00.697 --> 08:02.220
I had a bad dream.

08:02.307 --> 08:03.395
Oh, no, well, um...

08:03.483 --> 08:05.746
why don't you go back to bed

08:05.833 --> 08:07.835
and I'll come lay down
with you in a second?

08:09.532 --> 08:10.359
[sighs]

08:13.841 --> 08:14.885
I'm so sorry.

08:14.972 --> 08:15.930
I owe you one.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.587
Don't lay there too long.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.067
The sprinklers come on
in ten minutes.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.780
[huffs]

08:39.866 --> 08:41.085
What the hell?

08:41.172 --> 08:42.390
Can I help you?

08:42.477 --> 08:43.957
What time is the talent show?

08:44.044 --> 08:45.176
What talent show?

08:45.263 --> 08:47.178
There's no talent show today?

08:47.265 --> 08:48.397
I don't think so.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.660
Are you freaking kidding me?!

08:50.747 --> 08:53.489
I lost a day's pay
for no reason?

08:53.576 --> 08:55.578
Maybe we were destined to meet.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.583
It would definitely be
the high point of my day.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.503
Psst! Roscoe!

09:09.157 --> 09:10.201
Hi, Mom.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.246
What are you doing here?

09:11.333 --> 09:12.682
The talent show?

09:12.769 --> 09:13.857
That's not today.

09:13.944 --> 09:14.771
But you said it was!

09:14.858 --> 09:17.469
Guess I was wrong.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.429
I guess you were.

09:20.516 --> 09:23.519
Don't you kids tease him
about this.

Son of a bitch!

Oh, God, I need a drink.

09:33.529 --> 09:37.272
Hi, I'm Christy
and I'm an alcoholic.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.360
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

09:38.447 --> 09:41.493
I've been sober 118 days.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.104
Oh, don't applaud for that.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.933
They've been the worst
118 days of my life.

09:46.020 --> 09:46.890
[all laugh]

09:46.977 --> 09:49.110
Um... [chuckles]

09:49.197 --> 09:52.330
The only reason I'm here
is because, uh,

09:52.417 --> 09:54.158
I didn't want to turn
into my mother.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.378
And I did anyway.

09:57.553 --> 10:01.078
Yeah, I drank like her.

10:01.165 --> 10:04.038
I went through men like her.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.389
Um, I was selfish to my kids

10:07.476 --> 10:10.827
just like she was.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.394
And I didn't know how
to live any other way

10:12.481 --> 10:13.569
because she was
my only role model.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.705
I mean, some mothers teach

10:18.792 --> 10:20.315
their daughters how to bake.

10:20.402 --> 10:23.623
Mine taught me how
to beat a cavity search

10:23.710 --> 10:26.364
and still feel like a lady.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.149
[all laugh]

10:28.236 --> 10:30.804
Anyway, thanks
for letting me share.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.154
And I cannot tell you

10:33.241 --> 10:35.156
how comforting it is

10:35.243 --> 10:36.723
to be in a room with people

10:36.810 --> 10:38.725
who are just
as screwed up as I am, so...

10:38.812 --> 10:41.249
Oh, stop it.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.342
Hi, I'm Jim and
I'm an alcoholic.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.735
ALL:
Hi, Jim.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.388
Aren't you a little old
to be blaming

10:50.475 --> 10:52.347
all your problems
on your mother?

10:55.742 --> 10:57.700
Hi, Mom.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.489
Hi, I'm Greg.
May I take your order?

11:04.576 --> 11:06.796
Hi, Greg. I'm Bonnie and this
is my daughter, Christy.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.276
Hi.She and I

11:08.363 --> 11:10.060
haven't spoken
in a couple of years,

11:10.147 --> 11:12.280
so this is kind of
a big moment for us.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.282
Oh, for God's sake.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.197
What can you recommend
for a mother and daughter

11:16.284 --> 11:20.505
who are reconnecting
after a long, angry silence?

11:20.592 --> 11:23.247
Um... pie?

11:25.423 --> 11:26.773
Mom, please, just order.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.253
Um, is the mint tea
decaffeinated?

11:29.340 --> 11:30.994
Yes.Do you promise?

11:31.081 --> 11:32.953
If I have caffeine after 2:00,
my sleep in ruined.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.128
I promise.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.738
Okay, Greg, but if I wake up

11:35.825 --> 11:38.523
in the middle of the night,
I'm calling you.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.137
Well, I'll-I'll give you
my number.

11:43.224 --> 11:43.920
[Greg chuckles]

11:44.007 --> 11:45.705
[clears throat]

11:45.792 --> 11:47.315
Um, and for you?

11:47.402 --> 11:49.143
We have a lovely selection
of local wines.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.927
I'll have a bottle of each
and a funnel.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.713
She's kidding.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.584
We're both
in Alcoholics Anonymous.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.586
Mom, it's Alcoholics Anonymous,

11:57.673 --> 11:59.849
not Alcoholics Tell Your Waiter.

11:59.936 --> 12:02.069
Water is fine.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.245
Here, take this
knife away from me.

12:07.291 --> 12:10.642
So, when were you going
to tell me you quit drinking?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.035
Well, I was afraid
if I called you,

12:12.122 --> 12:12.993
I'd just start again.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.822
Not that you care,

12:15.909 --> 12:17.867
but I have two years clean
and sober myself.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.608
You're right; I don't care.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.305
Well, regardless,

12:21.392 --> 12:22.916
it has really changed my life.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.265
I have a steady job.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.614
I exercise.

12:25.701 --> 12:26.920
I'm in a book club.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.315
I have become the kind of woman
I've always hated.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.275
It is nice to see you
wearing underwear.

12:35.493 --> 12:35.885
And not on your head.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.585
GREG:
Here we go.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.152
Oh, Greg, honey,

12:42.239 --> 12:44.851
can I trouble you for some water
without ice?

12:44.938 --> 12:45.939
Ice isn't good
for my digestive system.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.592
Yeah, of course.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.377
Really? Ice?

12:49.464 --> 12:52.859
I think your digestive system
has seen worse than ice.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.991
Excuse me?

12:55.078 --> 12:57.864
Mom, I've watched you lick
cocaine crumbs

12:57.951 --> 13:00.954
out of a shag carpet.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.000
It's not a sin
to be thrifty, dear.

13:05.045 --> 13:07.003
Okay, here we go.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.831
Now, I hope that you're
being nice to your mother.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.138
Go away, Greg!Right.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.271
Whoa, whoa.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.751
You know,
just because you're sober

13:15.838 --> 13:17.187
doesn't mean
you can't take a Xanax.

13:17.274 --> 13:20.277
Actually, Mom, it sort of does.

13:20.364 --> 13:21.496
Really?

13:21.583 --> 13:24.673
Maybe I don't have two years.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.329
And I don't need a Xanax;
I'm doing great.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.373
Well, that's funny,
'cause your daughter

13:29.460 --> 13:30.940
says you're hanging on

13:31.027 --> 13:32.420
by your fingernails
and sleeping with your boss.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.204
Wait, when do you talk
to Violet?

13:34.291 --> 13:37.381
We talk all the time,
and we're Facebook friends.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.948
I don't want her talking to you.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.558
Well, she has to talk
to somebody.

13:40.645 --> 13:41.516
She's sexually active,

13:41.603 --> 13:43.823
drinking, smoking grass.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.215
Sound familiar?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.565
[scoffs]
You're making this about me?

13:47.652 --> 13:48.566
No, it's okay.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.264
I have come to understand

13:50.351 --> 13:51.787
that you were the best daughter
you could be.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.964
My job is to forgive you,
which I do.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.661
Oh, my God.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.360
You forgive me?

13:59.447 --> 14:01.841
I've come a long way.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.408
Excuse me,

14:04.495 --> 14:05.932
but if anybody needs
to be forgiven,

14:06.019 --> 14:07.324
it's you, and I don't,
and I never will.

14:07.411 --> 14:08.978
There's hardly a
day I can remember

14:09.065 --> 14:11.546
that I didn't come home
to an empty house.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.113
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.070
While other mothers
were cooking dinner,

14:14.157 --> 14:16.072
you were cooking meth.

14:16.159 --> 14:19.728
Otherwise known as "working."

14:21.991 --> 14:24.559
I don't want you in my life.

14:24.646 --> 14:27.127
And while you're at it,
stay away from my daughter.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.216
She may need
a better role model than me,

14:29.303 --> 14:30.521
but it's certainly not you.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.485
Is, uh, everything okay?

14:37.572 --> 14:38.094
My daughter doesn't get me.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.139
Oh.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.271
I'm sorry.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.969
What time do you get off work?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.884
I could use a lap to cry on.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.365
[sobbing]

14:48.452 --> 14:49.018
Oh.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.327
Stop crying.

14:53.414 --> 14:56.156
It wasn't an important finger.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.028
This doesn't concern you.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.685
Oh, good, you're still here.

15:03.772 --> 15:04.642
Hey, hi.

15:04.729 --> 15:06.253
This is a surprise.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.342
Yeah, I just really needed
to talk to you.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.343
I am having the worst day.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.258
Hey, you ready to go?

15:11.345 --> 15:12.389
Yes, dear.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.087
Um, Christy,
you know my, uh,

15:14.174 --> 15:17.917
wife.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.831
Yeah, hi, Claudia.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.963
Nice to see you again.

15:21.050 --> 15:24.010
It's "Clowdia."

15:24.097 --> 15:25.446
FYI, the ladies' room
needs some attention.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.536
I don't know if
that's you, Christy.

15:28.623 --> 15:31.539
It's not,
and it's "Christ-y."

15:31.626 --> 15:34.020
Okay, dear, let's go.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.065
Bye.
Yeah.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.204
Don't serve the soup.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.949
Hey, Mom. Dad's here!

15:50.036 --> 15:52.908
Yo, yo, baby mama.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.779
What do you want, Baxter?

15:54.866 --> 15:57.043
A father can't visit his son?

15:57.130 --> 16:00.220
Not when he's six months
behind on child support,

16:00.307 --> 16:04.093
but you're welcome to wave
at him through the window.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.443
Be right back, Roscoe.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.184
Don't be afraid to hit
the hookers with a bat.

16:11.753 --> 16:15.061
I think I may have found a way
to pay you your child support.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.584
Trust me, Baxter,

16:16.671 --> 16:18.107
you can't sell that much semen.

16:18.194 --> 16:21.632
I know. I tried.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.027
So, here's the deal:

16:25.114 --> 16:26.724
I know a guy who can hook me up

16:26.811 --> 16:29.901
with a couple of kilos
of premium Sonoma Kush.

16:29.989 --> 16:30.990
All I need

16:31.077 --> 16:32.861
is $2,000...

16:33.949 --> 16:36.908
...from you.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.649
Just so I'm clear:

16:38.736 --> 16:40.651
You want to pay child support

16:40.738 --> 16:43.219
by borrowing money from me
so you can buy pot?

16:43.306 --> 16:44.394
[laughing]:
No.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.005
So I can sell pot.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.790
There's no money
in buying pot.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.226
I know. I tried.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.708
LUKE:
Oh.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.884
Hey. Hello.

16:56.972 --> 16:57.538
What are you doing here?

16:57.625 --> 16:59.148
Um...

16:59.235 --> 17:01.324
Studying...?

17:03.065 --> 17:04.545
You let Violet have boys over

17:04.632 --> 17:05.720
while you're gone?

17:05.807 --> 17:07.548
No, I do not, and don't worry

17:07.635 --> 17:09.115
about her;
she's not your kid.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.334
I know, but this sets
a bad example for Roscoe.

17:13.510 --> 17:14.511
Oh, you're worried

17:14.598 --> 17:15.946
about setting a bad example?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.558
You had Roscoe pee

17:17.645 --> 17:19.125
into a sippy cup
so you could pass a drug test.

17:19.212 --> 17:22.214
And it worked.

17:22.301 --> 17:25.392
[knocking on door]

17:25.479 --> 17:26.871
I like bananas.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.743
They have
their own carrying case.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.225
You know
I can't divorce Claudia.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.270
Her father
owns the restaurant;

17:34.357 --> 17:35.532
I'm pretty sure
he'd fire me, and then what?

17:35.619 --> 17:37.882
I was an English major.[sighs]

17:40.494 --> 17:42.452
I can't believe you're sleeping
with that loser.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.367
I can't believe you're
sleeping with this loser!

17:44.454 --> 17:47.022
Hey, we were mostly studying.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.197
Shut up, Luke.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.807
I love him.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.940
Please, I used to love him.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.203
She did.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.380
Mom, Luke and I have been
together for, like, a year.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.166
You only started noticing
when you stopped drinking.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.734
[sighs]

18:03.821 --> 18:05.171
You're right.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.607
I-I haven't been
a very good mother,

18:06.694 --> 18:07.347
and I'm sorry, but...

18:07.434 --> 18:09.175
But what?

18:09.262 --> 18:10.350
[scoffs]

18:10.437 --> 18:12.830
You want me to forgive you?

18:12.917 --> 18:13.744
Oh, God, would you?

18:13.831 --> 18:15.920
That'd be awesome.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.487
Why should I forgive you

18:17.574 --> 18:19.359
when you can't even forgive
your own mother?

18:19.446 --> 18:21.361
That's different.How?

18:21.448 --> 18:24.103
[scoffs][scoffs]

18:28.585 --> 18:30.065
Okay.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.023
[wry laugh]

18:32.111 --> 18:33.895
Okay... [clears throat]

18:38.813 --> 18:40.293
[sighs]

18:40.380 --> 18:41.468
Hello, Mom, it's Christy.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.297
Yeah, yeah, today was a blast.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.475
Listen...

18:48.562 --> 18:50.172
I just want you to know

18:50.259 --> 18:53.741
that I forgive you

18:53.828 --> 18:54.742
for everything you did

18:54.829 --> 18:56.439
when I was growing up.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.269
I get, now, that you did

19:00.356 --> 19:02.315
the best you could...

19:04.752 --> 19:06.275
...just like I'm doing.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.627
And...

19:10.714 --> 19:13.239
I hope that you
and I can wipe the slate clean

19:13.326 --> 19:15.284
and start over.

19:19.027 --> 19:21.290
No, I did not take a
Xanax from your purse.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.250
Listen, I gotta go.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.252
Yeah, talk soon.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.514
[sighs]

19:27.601 --> 19:28.471
There.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.430
I've forgiven my mother.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.867
Are we good?

19:32.954 --> 19:34.912
It's not that easy.

19:34.999 --> 19:35.522
Oh, come on!

19:35.609 --> 19:38.002
Like me!

19:38.089 --> 19:39.134
[door shuts]

19:39.221 --> 19:40.614
ROSCOE:
Hey, Dad!

19:40.701 --> 19:42.093
If you hit the hookers
enough times,

19:42.181 --> 19:44.705
they give you your money back.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.272
Smart kid.

19:46.359 --> 19:50.841
That's my semen at work.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.367
[sighs]

19:54.454 --> 19:57.108
You still living
in that red van?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.632
Yep.

19:58.719 --> 20:01.765
Looks like your house
is being towed.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.333
Oh, no, my cleaning
lady's in there.

20:08.772 --> 20:09.425
What a day, huh?

20:17.955 --> 20:18.434
[giggling]

20:20.567 --> 20:21.481
Hello...?

20:21.568 --> 20:23.091
Oh, hi, Mom.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.048
Hello, sweetie.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.702
What are you doing here?

20:25.789 --> 20:27.530
I just thought I'd help out
while you were at work.

20:27.617 --> 20:28.575
You know, clean slate.

20:28.662 --> 20:29.880
You didn't have to do that.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.360
Yeah, she did.

20:31.447 --> 20:32.579
Bonnie made Roscoe and me
hot dinner.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.406
Yeah, but I...It was hot,

20:33.493 --> 20:35.321
Mom.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.280
Like on TV.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.717
Night, Bonnie.

20:40.804 --> 20:41.979
[chuckles]

20:42.066 --> 20:43.154
Mwah.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.286
[chuckles]

20:49.987 --> 20:51.250
She calls you Bonnie?

20:51.337 --> 20:53.643
We're like sisters.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.950
You hungry?

20:56.037 --> 20:57.386
No, thanks.
I ate at the restaurant.

20:57.473 --> 20:58.431
How about some tea?

20:59.475 --> 21:01.999
Okay.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.350
[sighs]

21:04.437 --> 21:06.613
I'm so glad

21:06.700 --> 21:07.440
you and I have a chance

21:07.527 --> 21:09.746
to start over.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.661
Forgive me,
but I'm not quite there yet.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.707
Of course I forgive you.

21:16.405 --> 21:17.276
[sighs]

21:17.363 --> 21:19.800
You know,

21:19.887 --> 21:21.454
I apologized for being
a crappy daughter.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.891
Is there anything

21:23.978 --> 21:25.240
you want to say to me?

21:25.327 --> 21:28.548
I love you with all my heart.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.158
And...?

21:30.245 --> 21:32.726
And from now on,

21:32.813 --> 21:34.423
I'm going to be the kind
of mother you deserve.

21:34.510 --> 21:37.600
This is the start
of a new chapter.

21:37.687 --> 21:38.906
[doorbell rings]

21:38.993 --> 21:39.994
[gasps]
Oh, that's my date.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.607
New chapter, same book.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.480
Ready to go?

21:47.567 --> 21:49.133
Yeah, let me just get my bag.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.831
You remember our waiter Greg.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.441
Hi, new dad!

21:54.617 --> 21:56.576
Oh, stop.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.491
He's way too young for me.

21:58.578 --> 22:01.145
And he's married.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.060
Married.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.671
What a whore.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.282
[door closes]

22:07.369 --> 22:08.892
Oh, I almost forgot.

22:08.979 --> 22:09.937
Your daughter thinks
she might be pregnant.

22:10.024 --> 22:11.330
Call me if you need me.
