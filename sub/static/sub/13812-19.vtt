10:38.972 --> 10:39.738
I SAID IT.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.339
MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR.

10:41.341 --> 10:46.344

13:39.486 --> 13:44.489
THEREFORE, YOU COULD NEVER
BE FRY COOK TO A GOD AND...

13:44.491 --> 13:46.891

14:07.747 --> 14:09.647
I DON'T MAKE THEM;
I JUST SELL THEM.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.750
THEN WHO PULLED
UP THE SPATULA?

14:12.752 --> 14:14.452
WELL, HE DID.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.021
(<i> laughing</i> )

14:17.023 --> 14:21.392
IT IS EVEN <i> FUNNIER</i>
A SECOND TIME.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.528
YOU, THERE--

14:36.910 --> 14:37.909
BODY SLAM!

14:37.911 --> 14:41.145
YOU PULLED THE SPATULA
FROM THE GREASE.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.548
NOPE, THAT WAS SPONGEBOB.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.118
THIS JOKE HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH!

14:47.120 --> 14:50.188
WHERE'S
MY FRY COOK?

14:50.190 --> 14:51.656
CERTAINLY YOU

14:51.658 --> 14:53.024
WITH YOUR PRODIGIOUS GIRTH

14:53.026 --> 14:55.260

WHO CAN FLIP A BURGER

14:55.262 --> 14:57.462
TO SUIT A ROYAL PALATE!

14:59.099 --> 14:59.631
WHAT?!

14:59.633 --> 15:01.099
AM I EXPECTED
TO BELIEVE

15:01.101 --> 15:04.135
THIS CREATURE IS ROYAL
FRY COOK MATERIAL?

15:04.137 --> 15:07.639
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU HAVE ANY PROOF.

15:10.176 --> 15:10.808
HA!

15:10.810 --> 15:13.645
THIS THING IS UNFIT
TO EVEN SCRUB

15:13.647 --> 15:14.746
THE ROYAL TAIL FIN!

15:14.748 --> 15:17.215
AND BESIDES, IT'S
NOT JUST ENOUGH

15:17.217 --> 15:20.318
TO PULL A SPATULA OFF
A GREASY GRIDDLE;

15:20.320 --> 15:22.553
THERE ARE CERTAIN...
QUALITIES

15:22.555 --> 15:25.590
THAT A ROYAL FRY
COOK MUST HAVE.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.624
LIKE?

15:26.626 --> 15:29.527
THE ROYAL FRY COOK MUST BE...

15:29.529 --> 15:31.462
OH, LEFT-HANDED.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.032
ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT TWO.

15:34.034 --> 15:34.999
(<i> fingers snapping</i> )

15:35.001 --> 15:38.903
ALSO, THE ROYAL FRY COOK
WEARS... RED UNDERWEAR.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.571
NO, BLUE.

15:40.573 --> 15:41.940
OH!

15:41.942 --> 15:44.108
THE ROYAL FRY COOK'S
WALLET CONTAINS

15:44.110 --> 15:45.944
HIS BIG TOES...

15:45.946 --> 15:47.211
UH, HE HAS SIX.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.815
HE IS THE NEW

PATRICK!

15:57.324 --> 15:58.957
YOU HURT MY FRIEND!

15:58.959 --> 16:00.158
YOU'RE NOT A KING.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.093
YOU'RE A BULLY AND A LIAR!

16:02.095 --> 16:03.061
SO, LITTLE ONE...

16:03.063 --> 16:08.232
YOU THINK YOU HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO
BE MY FRY COOK.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.202
I WILL PROVE YOUR
WORTHLESSNESS.

16:11.204 --> 16:15.073
YOU SHALL BE TESTED
WITH A CHALLENGE!

16:15.075 --> 16:16.374

BRING IT ON!

16:16.376 --> 16:20.078
SPONGEBOB CAN HANDLE ANY...

16:20.080 --> 16:21.346
OUCH!

16:21.348 --> 16:26.084
YOUR FRIEND'S ARROGANCE
WILL COST YOU DEARLY.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.187
THERE WILL BE
TWO CHALLENGES!

16:29.189 --> 16:30.521
Patrick:
ONLY TWO?!

WHAT ARE <i> TWO</i>
CHALLENGES

16:32.425 --> 16:34.792

16:34.794 --> 16:36.794
THREE CHALLENGES!

16:36.796 --> 16:38.129
Patrick:
THREE?!

16:38.131 --> 16:39.430
(<i> laughing</i> )

16:39.432 --> 16:41.933
THREE CHALLENGES
ARE NOTHING.

16:41.935 --> 16:45.336
MIGHT AS WELL BE
500 CHALLENGES!

16:45.338 --> 16:47.138
ENOUGH!

16:47.140 --> 16:48.840
HE'LL SETTLE FOR ONE.

16:48.842 --> 16:53.711
THERE WILL BE
BUT ONE CHALLENGE:

17:49.302 --> 17:51.402
HEY, THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY GOOD.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.838
BUT IF YOU SHOULD
NOT SUCCEED...

17:53.840 --> 17:56.974
YOU MUST GIVE UP FRY COOKING...

17:56.976 --> 17:58.876

SO, UH... WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

21:18.311 --> 21:21.412
YOURS IS SUPERIOR.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.382
THEREFORE,
I CONCEDE TO YOU--

21:24.384 --> 21:27.785
SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS,
YOU WIN.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.720
(<i> cheering</i> )

21:29.722 --> 21:30.421
YAY!
YAY!

21:30.423 --> 21:33.224
Both:
WE'RE GOING TO ATLANTIS!

21:33.226 --> 21:35.326
WE'RE GOING TO ATLANTIS!

21:35.328 --> 21:36.694
(<i> Neptune laughing</i> )

21:36.696 --> 21:37.628
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.397
YOU, SPONGEBOB.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.198
THAT REPULSIVE THING

21:41.200 --> 21:42.767
IN MY PALACE?!

21:42.769 --> 21:45.536
YOU MEAN PATRICK
CAN'T COME?

21:45.538 --> 21:47.471
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:47.473 --> 21:50.341
OH, OF COURSE NOT.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.075
AND MY FRIENDS...?

21:51.077 --> 21:54.412
AH, THE ONLY FRIEND YOU'LL NEED,
MY DEAR BOY

21:54.414 --> 21:56.147
IS THE ROYAL GRILL.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.749
IT WAS NICE
KNOWING YOU, BUDDY.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.585
(<i> wailing</i> )

22:01.587 --> 22:02.653
I KNOW, MR. KRABS.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.021
I'LL MISS YOU, TOO.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.690
I LOST ME BET!

22:05.692 --> 22:07.091
(<i> crying</i> )

22:07.093 --> 22:09.226
COME, SPONGEBOB,
GRAB YOUR THINGS.

22:09.228 --> 22:12.463
IT'S TIME TO DEPART...

22:12.465 --> 22:14.265
TO ATLANTIS!

22:14.267 --> 22:15.599
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

22:15.601 --> 22:16.133
I... I...

22:16.135 --> 22:21.439
(<i> sobbing</i> ):
I DON'T WANT TO GO!

22:21.441 --> 22:22.540
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.810
I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT YOUR BURGERS.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.546
YOU'RE GOING TO BE A GOD

22:28.548 --> 22:31.015
AND LIKE IT!

22:34.220 --> 22:35.720
MAYBE WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.322
(<i> booming voice</i> ):
WAIT, NEPTUNE!

22:38.324 --> 22:40.825
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.863
GOOD MORNING, KRUSTY CREW.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.032
HI, PATRICK.
WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.100
UH...

22:49.102 --> 22:51.235
(<i> Neptune hollers</i> )

22:51.237 --> 22:52.002
CAN YOU EXCUSE ME?

22:52.004 --> 22:55.206
THE ACCURSED STOVE
HAS BURNT MY FINGER.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.708
FEEL THINE OWN WRATH,
STOVE!

22:57.710 --> 22:59.076
(<i> rumbling</i> )
HA-HA!

22:59.078 --> 23:02.913
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
USING YOUR POWERS, TRAINEE?

23:02.915 --> 23:08.919
PERFECT PATTIES ARE MADE
WITH LOVE, NOT MAGIC.
