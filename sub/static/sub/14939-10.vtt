WEBVTT

00:02.117 --> 00:03.517
I couldn't understand.

00:03.552 --> 00:06.087
They just kept saying the same
thing over and over again.

00:06.121 --> 00:07.288
Tell me about the shooter.

00:07.322 --> 00:08.389
He was brainwashed.

00:08.423 --> 00:10.391
You did murder
a federal prisoner.

00:10.425 --> 00:12.036
I couldn't control that.

00:12.071 --> 00:13.923
The best place for you now
is with us.

00:13.957 --> 00:15.987
I've always been better off
on my own.

00:16.021 --> 00:19.486
So this is how we deal
with Alphas?

00:19.521 --> 00:21.720
When things go wrong,
we assassinate?

00:21.755 --> 00:23.621
It's not what I signed up for.

00:23.655 --> 00:24.755
Red Flag must have used her

00:24.789 --> 00:26.491
to encode
some of their transmissions.

00:26.525 --> 00:27.660
You work for Red Flag.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.900
No, Gary, they work for me.

00:29.934 --> 00:31.966
Are you really my friend?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.300
Of course I'm your friend.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.267
Gary, I know you like Anna.

00:35.301 --> 00:36.967
But remember,
I'm your friend too.

00:37.002 --> 00:37.968
Yeah, I know.

00:38.002 --> 00:39.433
But you're not one of us.

00:39.467 --> 00:41.568
Great report.

00:41.602 --> 00:43.005
If you like fiction.

00:43.039 --> 00:44.842
Well, I'm sure
Agent Nathan Cley

00:44.876 --> 00:46.811
will be more than happy
to fill in the blanks.

00:46.846 --> 00:47.980
I'm sure he will too
considering

00:48.015 --> 00:50.019
he's already raising hell
over at the DOD.

00:50.053 --> 00:52.355
You think I'm gonna
let this slide....

00:52.389 --> 00:56.857
Then you've really
misjudged me too.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.795
A man with your abilities
could make a lot of money,

00:59.829 --> 01:03.000
if he went into business
for himself.

01:03.035 --> 01:05.135
It's never gonna happen.

01:05.170 --> 01:06.940
I don't care what Cley says.

01:06.975 --> 01:09.011
This was a bad idea.

01:09.045 --> 01:13.717
Yes, we do seem to be learning
by trial and error, hmm.

01:13.751 --> 01:15.419
Mostly error.

01:15.453 --> 01:17.554
Things aren't going to get
easier, are they?

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.680 --> 01:48.882
You're late.

01:52.354 --> 01:53.887
You're not
with the committee.

01:53.922 --> 01:56.857
No. I'm not.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.529
You're one of them,
aren't you?

02:02.764 --> 02:06.667
Some mistakes never go away.

02:18.645 --> 02:20.980
Some do.

Original Air Date on September 19, 2011

02:58.938 --> 03:01.460
But I'm not supposed to go
to work today.

03:01.461 --> 03:02.929
- I took vacation time.
- I know.

03:02.963 --> 03:05.098
But I need your help
with something in the office.

03:05.133 --> 03:06.733
It's the New York Auto Show
at the Javitz Center,

03:06.768 --> 03:08.201
and it takes four days
to see everything.

03:08.236 --> 03:09.870
Four, that's why
I took off today.

03:09.904 --> 03:11.138
Gary, don't dawdle,
come on.

03:11.172 --> 03:12.907
I've already seen
all the English, French,

03:12.941 --> 03:14.275
German, and Italian cars.

03:14.309 --> 03:15.643
I'm working my way east.

03:15.677 --> 03:17.078
And today's Asia,
'cause there's a system.

03:17.112 --> 03:19.080
I know how much it means
to you to see the car show,

03:19.115 --> 03:21.250
but I promise
you won't miss that much.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.551
Yeah, 'cause tomorrow's
America.

03:22.585 --> 03:25.420
You know Americans
still make a lot of cars.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.189
Like that one.
What are they doing here?

03:27.224 --> 03:29.058
I don't know.

03:29.092 --> 03:30.626
Get down, get down, get down!

03:51.182 --> 03:53.251
Damn it.

03:53.285 --> 03:54.685
Agent Harken.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.922
Hey, tactical.

03:57.957 --> 03:59.891
Have we got a case?

03:59.925 --> 04:01.159
Nah, you don't.

04:01.193 --> 04:02.294
But we do.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.167
Bag him.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.274
Hey!

04:23.818 --> 04:25.986
Alphas.

04:27.488 --> 04:28.888
I've never seen it.

04:28.923 --> 04:30.523
Come on, everybody's seen
<i>Casablanca.</i>

04:30.558 --> 04:33.927
It's the greatest love, bar,
spy, tuxedo movie ever made.

04:33.962 --> 04:36.397
I figured you for more of
<i>Field of Dreams</i> type of guy.

04:36.431 --> 04:38.700
Nope, never seen it.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.702
I refuse to believe
Mr. Baseball

04:40.736 --> 04:42.036
hasn't seen <i>Field of Dreams.</i>

04:42.070 --> 04:43.704
Mm-mm,
I won't go see any movie

04:43.738 --> 04:45.005
that I know
is gonna make me cry.

04:45.039 --> 04:48.107
If one sneaks up on me,
that's fine.

04:48.142 --> 04:51.210
A little while back, I took
Tyler to see that movie, uh, <i>Up.</i>

04:51.244 --> 04:53.179
Totally sideswiped me.

04:54.615 --> 04:55.982
But I'm not doing that
to myself on purpose.

04:56.016 --> 04:58.016
I thought <i>Casablanca</i>
<i>had a sad ending.</i>

04:58.051 --> 04:59.251
Oh, no.

04:59.285 --> 05:00.819
Bogie was much better
off with Claude Rains.

05:02.288 --> 05:04.255
Rachel!

05:04.290 --> 05:06.257
Rachel!

05:07.726 --> 05:09.193
Run!

06:22.704 --> 06:25.072
What the--

06:26.441 --> 06:28.609
Dr. Rosen!

06:28.643 --> 06:31.345
Dr. Rosen! Help!

06:51.001 --> 06:54.738
I demand to know
what's going on.

06:54.772 --> 06:55.973
You're not in a position

06:56.007 --> 06:57.909
to make any demands, Lee.

06:57.943 --> 06:59.377
The cells you're in
are soundproof.

07:00.412 --> 07:02.713
Signal proof.
Escape proof.

07:02.747 --> 07:06.116
Alpha proof.

07:06.150 --> 07:08.351
Nathan?

07:08.385 --> 07:09.952
What have you done?

07:09.987 --> 07:11.120
You're in Binghamton,

07:11.154 --> 07:12.388
along with
the rest of your team.

07:12.422 --> 07:13.989
And you're going to be here

07:14.023 --> 07:15.824
until I find out which one
of you is the traitor.

07:23.665 --> 07:24.865
Come on.

07:25.297 --> 07:26.497
Let's go.

07:27.402 --> 07:28.602
This way.

07:29.604 --> 07:31.972
Dr. Rosen!

07:37.845 --> 07:39.045
Keep walking.

07:41.314 --> 07:43.515
What are you doing?

07:54.128 --> 07:55.963
Nathan, have you
lost your mind?

07:55.997 --> 07:58.065
When Sullivan
hears about this--

07:58.099 --> 08:00.067
This was Sullivan's call.

08:00.101 --> 08:04.305
She ordered you to tranquilize
us like animals?

08:04.340 --> 08:06.174
That was my call.

08:06.209 --> 08:08.309
I don't want anyone else
getting dead

08:08.344 --> 08:09.577
on account of your team.

08:09.611 --> 08:12.313
Nathan, you still
haven't told us

08:12.347 --> 08:14.181
what we're accused of.

08:14.216 --> 08:17.250
Harold Freeman,
Mitchell Stentz, Karl Baxter.

08:17.285 --> 08:18.985
Sound familiar?

08:19.020 --> 08:20.053
Yes, of course.

08:20.087 --> 08:22.021
Scientists who work
for MK Ultra.

08:22.055 --> 08:24.557
The Cold War Alphas program,
they were all part of it.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.758
What about them?

08:25.792 --> 08:28.694
They were your predecessors
in a way.

08:28.729 --> 08:30.429
Recently deceased.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.967
Nathan, don't be coy
with me.

08:35.001 --> 08:36.235
Just tell me what's happening.

08:36.269 --> 08:38.470
Each of them were killed
late yesterday

08:38.505 --> 08:40.239
by a quick-moving necrosis
that spread

08:40.273 --> 08:41.940
through their veins
in a matter of seconds.

08:41.975 --> 08:44.275
No toxins detected,
no puncture marks, so...

08:44.310 --> 08:47.513
I can tell you none
of my team has this ability.

08:47.547 --> 08:49.949
No, the ability belongs to an
assassin who works for Red Flag.

08:49.983 --> 08:52.619
But you do have access
to the MK Ultra files.

08:52.653 --> 08:54.054
The unredacted ones.

08:54.088 --> 08:56.156
The ones with real names,
addresses.

08:56.191 --> 08:57.925
Well, I don't know
what that proves.

08:57.959 --> 08:59.794
They've been in my possession
for years.

08:59.828 --> 09:01.396
Except each of these
received

09:01.430 --> 09:03.798
a call from your office
only hours before they died.

09:03.833 --> 09:07.235
Encoded with the original MK
Ultra signs and countersigns.

09:07.269 --> 09:09.103
Your phones.

09:09.138 --> 09:11.572
Codes you and yours had almost
exclusive access to.

09:11.606 --> 09:14.908
Someone in your group
identified these old men

09:14.943 --> 09:16.410
and set them up to die.

09:16.444 --> 09:18.411
Nathan, if anyone's
being set up, it's us.

09:18.445 --> 09:21.214
There are any number of ways
these could have been faked.

09:21.248 --> 09:24.884
Phone taps, hackers,
not to mention Alpha abilities.

09:24.918 --> 09:26.252
Occam's razor.

09:27.888 --> 09:30.557
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

09:30.591 --> 09:32.758
All the evidence
points back to you

09:32.793 --> 09:34.093
or someone from your team.

09:34.128 --> 09:37.063
Red Flag tried to kill me,
Nathan, and my team.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.366
You think one of us
is suddenly a sympathizer?

09:39.401 --> 09:40.568
Sympathizer...

09:40.602 --> 09:45.774
Double Agent, mole,
financial opportunist...

09:45.808 --> 09:47.576
They all mean traitor.

09:47.610 --> 09:49.144
Nathan, I know my team--

09:49.178 --> 09:50.312
better than you,
better than anyone--

09:50.346 --> 09:52.581
and I trust them completely.

09:52.615 --> 09:55.251
I'm reading evasion.

09:55.285 --> 09:57.619
Pain and contempt.

09:57.654 --> 09:59.688
He doesn't like you.

09:59.723 --> 10:02.659
What you just said,
that wasn't the truth.

10:03.961 --> 10:07.130
Look, I'm not working
for Red Flag.

10:07.164 --> 10:08.999
I'm not helping Red Flag.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.135
I don't know these gray hairs.

10:11.169 --> 10:13.504
And I sure as hell don't have
any reason to want them dead.

10:13.539 --> 10:18.276
Seriously, come on,
who kills an 80-year-old man?

10:18.311 --> 10:20.145
What's the point?
Just wait a few months.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.346
He's being honest.

10:21.381 --> 10:22.581
I think.

10:22.615 --> 10:26.285
I mean, it's not 100%.
I told you that.

10:26.319 --> 10:28.653
Red Flag
had you kill before.

10:28.688 --> 10:30.789
It wasn't me.
It was mind control.

10:30.823 --> 10:33.224
So you admit to being
susceptible to mind control.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.726
Well, you want me
to say that

10:35.761 --> 10:38.796
maybe I'm working
for Red Flag and I don't know.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.832
Well...
Considering the things

10:41.866 --> 10:44.200
I've seen
in the last few months,

10:44.234 --> 10:45.735
can't rule it out.

10:45.769 --> 10:48.504
I feel that while significant
strides have been made

10:48.539 --> 10:50.907
in expanding
the use of her ability,

10:50.941 --> 10:54.010
she still lacks
the emotional maturity

10:54.045 --> 10:57.013
required to realize
her full potential.

10:57.048 --> 10:59.916
That's just rude.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.852
Dark glasses in a meeting.

11:01.886 --> 11:03.653
I could sit behind you.

11:03.688 --> 11:05.655
Or blindfold you
if you'd rather go that route.

11:05.689 --> 11:07.390
Scared of making eye contact

11:07.424 --> 11:09.993
with the evil
mind-bending Alpha?

11:10.027 --> 11:12.028
Have it your way.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.530
Got to wonder.
Full potential.

11:13.564 --> 11:15.031
What do you think Dr. Rosen
meant by that?

11:15.065 --> 11:18.567
I don't know,
maybe that I, uh...

11:18.601 --> 11:21.703
I could go a week or two
without pushing someone.

11:21.737 --> 11:23.838
Actually pay rent on my loft.

11:23.873 --> 11:26.041
Drive a car I didn't borrow.

11:26.075 --> 11:28.243
So you admit to being
a thief and a con artist?

11:28.278 --> 11:31.447
I've been working
for the D.O.D. for years.

11:31.481 --> 11:34.183
Haven't had any problems
with my lifestyle until now.

11:34.218 --> 11:36.085
Disillusionment
doesn't happen overnight.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.621
Those roots take time to grow,

11:37.655 --> 11:39.223
and when they do,
small buds appear.

11:39.257 --> 11:42.059
You think we don't know what
happened with Skylar Adams?

11:42.093 --> 11:45.763
Helping Skylar
was the right thing to do.

11:45.797 --> 11:47.464
No remorse.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.935
None.

11:50.969 --> 11:52.769
So basically,
you just go around

11:52.804 --> 11:54.071
doing whatever the hell
you want.

11:54.105 --> 11:55.572
Damn the consequences.

11:59.309 --> 12:02.077
I told you.
Anna is my friend.

12:02.112 --> 12:05.247
And there's no rule against
talking to your friends.

12:05.281 --> 12:08.249
It's sign that I'm improving
my social interactions.

12:08.284 --> 12:11.019
Your friend
is a Red Flag terrorist.

12:11.054 --> 12:15.124
Yeah, I know that.
But we don't talk about work.

12:15.158 --> 12:17.160
You're hiding your signals.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.495
I know you are,
'cause I can feel them,

12:19.530 --> 12:21.665
but I--I can't reach them.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.799
So you never said
anything to Anna

12:22.833 --> 12:25.169
about the MK Ultra program?

12:25.203 --> 12:26.871
No, that would be work.

12:26.905 --> 12:28.339
When you interrogate people,

12:28.373 --> 12:29.874
it's very important
to pay attention

12:29.908 --> 12:31.875
to what they say.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.411
So what do you talk about?

12:33.445 --> 12:35.279
It's private.

12:35.314 --> 12:37.015
That means that
it's none of your business.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.184
That woman hurt people,
Mr. Bell.

12:39.219 --> 12:40.586
She's dangerous.

12:40.620 --> 12:42.455
No, that's not true.

12:42.489 --> 12:43.823
Anna has never hurt anyone.

12:43.857 --> 12:45.825
Yeah, she hurt me one time,

12:45.859 --> 12:47.660
but then she apologized.

12:47.694 --> 12:49.195
And she says that Red Flag

12:49.230 --> 12:51.231
doesn't want
to hurt people either.

12:51.265 --> 12:54.467
It's just sometimes they have to
to protect other Alphas.

12:54.502 --> 12:57.637
That's people like me.

12:57.671 --> 13:00.340
You're a signal bully.
That sucks.

13:00.374 --> 13:02.508
Anyway, you hurt people too.

13:02.543 --> 13:05.478
You hurt me
with some sleeping bullets.

13:05.513 --> 13:07.180
And I didn't want
to go to sleep.

13:07.214 --> 13:08.381
I just woke up.

13:08.415 --> 13:11.117
I can't read him.

13:11.151 --> 13:14.153
His expressions, inflections--
they're all over the place.

13:14.188 --> 13:16.456
Now you and I both know
I'm not Red Flag.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.458
How many different ways
you want me to tell you this?

13:18.492 --> 13:20.026
Hey, I know
you're not the mole.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.528
Oh, now you I can read.

13:22.563 --> 13:24.630
That was a lie.

13:24.665 --> 13:26.999
Look, we had to bring you in
along with everyone else.

13:27.033 --> 13:29.668
Otherwise they would have been
suspicious.

13:29.703 --> 13:31.003
Well, you shot me,
what--18 times?

13:31.038 --> 13:32.972
You did a really good job
selling that.

13:33.007 --> 13:34.974
You and I are more alike
than what you want to admit.

13:35.008 --> 13:38.243
Guys saddled with jobs
they don't particularly want.

13:38.277 --> 13:42.881
Working with people
we can't completely trust.

13:42.916 --> 13:45.049
You can't actually
sit there and tell me

13:45.084 --> 13:47.419
none of your coworkers
fits the profile

13:47.453 --> 13:49.354
of someone who might go over
to the other side.

13:49.388 --> 13:50.688
You know what,
if they didn't before,

13:50.723 --> 13:52.924
you are sure driving them
in that direction.

13:52.958 --> 13:56.360
That's a very qualified
answer, Agent Harken.

13:56.394 --> 13:58.195
We're on the verge of making
a massive move

13:58.229 --> 13:59.496
against Red Flag.

13:59.531 --> 14:00.964
And your team has a mole

14:00.998 --> 14:02.932
that could jeopardize
the entire initiative.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.334
Are you telling me you don't
want to identify that person?

14:10.841 --> 14:12.074
You're a trained
investigator.

14:12.109 --> 14:13.709
You've got to suspect someone.

14:13.743 --> 14:15.578
Who's tops on your list?

14:15.612 --> 14:18.914
Mr. Hicks?
Ms. Theroux?

14:18.949 --> 14:20.182
Okay, yeah.

14:20.217 --> 14:22.251
People in the office say
bad things about the government.

14:22.285 --> 14:24.520
But Nina
doesn't mean anything by it.

14:24.555 --> 14:26.122
Not that
I'm singling out Nina.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.626
We all say bad things
about the government.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.662
That's not what I meant
either.

14:31.696 --> 14:34.098
Ms. Pirzad.
Relax.

14:34.132 --> 14:36.467
I am relaxed.

14:36.501 --> 14:40.038
It's just...we all worry that,
one day,

14:40.072 --> 14:41.373
men in black will swoop in

14:41.407 --> 14:44.543
and, well,
we'll end up here.

14:44.577 --> 14:46.111
We're afraid of this.

14:46.145 --> 14:48.113
Of today.

14:52.784 --> 14:55.919
Ask her if she
has a boyfriend yet.

14:55.954 --> 14:57.721
Isn't she a little young
for you?

14:57.755 --> 14:59.389
Excuse me?

14:59.423 --> 15:00.623
Never mind.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.767
There's someone
behind the glass.

15:10.802 --> 15:12.803
I wouldn't worry
about that.

15:12.837 --> 15:14.638
Who's there?
I know someone's there.

15:14.672 --> 15:16.440
I can hear your heartbeat.

15:16.474 --> 15:18.809
Hi, Rachel.
It's Eric.

15:18.844 --> 15:20.244
Long time.

15:20.279 --> 15:22.613
Eric Letrobe?
I know him.

15:22.648 --> 15:23.815
We brought him here
two years ago.

15:23.849 --> 15:25.483
Eric, what are you doing?

15:25.517 --> 15:27.518
I'm reading
your micro-expressions.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.519
So far, so good.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.622
Cley said if I help out,
he'll get me out of this dump.

15:32.657 --> 15:36.993
So maybe once I get out,
you and I can catch a movie.

15:37.027 --> 15:39.996
Eric, can you please tell Cley
that I'm telling the truth?

15:40.030 --> 15:41.564
Or maybe go to a show.

15:41.598 --> 15:43.599
<i>Les Miz,</i> or <i>The Producers.</i>
'Cause I know a guy.

15:43.634 --> 15:45.868
Eric, I don't even think those
shows are running anymore.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.203
If the two are you
are done,

15:47.238 --> 15:50.006
I'm trying to conduct
an investigation.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.343
More like a witch hunt.

15:53.377 --> 15:55.378
It's not a witch hunt
if one of you is guilty.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.513
And one of you is.

15:56.547 --> 15:58.982
Unless you're wrong.

15:59.017 --> 16:02.186
And then you're turning
friends into enemies.

16:02.221 --> 16:03.855
Is that a threat?

16:06.425 --> 16:07.626
What do you want me
to tell you?

16:07.660 --> 16:08.860
I--I know who the mole is?

16:08.894 --> 16:11.062
I don't.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.897
You want me
to pick someone at random?

16:12.931 --> 16:14.298
Hicks.

16:14.332 --> 16:16.467
He's handsome.
Too handsome.

16:20.338 --> 16:21.972
Time to change the plan.

16:22.006 --> 16:25.274
Hey, Gary.

16:25.308 --> 16:27.242
- You okay?
- No.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.412
So what's next, huh?
What are they gonna do?

16:29.446 --> 16:30.579
What does Cley want?

16:30.614 --> 16:31.881
Hey, Rachel, just try
to calm down.

16:31.915 --> 16:33.248
I am calm,
okay, Bill?

16:33.283 --> 16:34.383
You don't seem that calm.

16:34.417 --> 16:35.751
Why are you letting him
do this to us?

16:35.785 --> 16:38.953
I'm not letting him
do this, Nina.

16:38.988 --> 16:41.056
This is--this is Cley's game.

16:41.090 --> 16:42.357
- Game?
- Yes.

16:42.391 --> 16:43.625
Well, he's obviously

16:43.659 --> 16:45.226
interviewed
all of us individually

16:45.260 --> 16:46.928
and hasn't found a suspect.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.429
So he's brought us all
here together.

16:49.464 --> 16:51.398
Anyone could have accessed
our computers.

16:51.432 --> 16:52.566
The invisible girl...

16:52.600 --> 16:53.867
No, I checked.

16:53.901 --> 16:56.103
No one but us has ever read
those MK Ultra files.

16:56.137 --> 16:57.771
So we're his only suspects.

16:57.805 --> 16:58.839
Everybody relax.

16:58.873 --> 17:00.573
None of us works for Red Flag.

17:00.608 --> 17:03.543
Cley says that--
that I'm the informant

17:03.577 --> 17:06.445
because I talk to Anna.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.248
- What, you still talk to Anna?
- Yeah.

17:08.281 --> 17:09.915
But I don't
tell her anything.

17:09.950 --> 17:11.484
Gary, what do you
talk to Anna about?

17:11.519 --> 17:13.587
Well, I don't talk
about work.

17:13.621 --> 17:14.954
Gary, you shouldn't be
doing that.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.522
No, I just told her about
my new jacket,

17:16.558 --> 17:17.691
that it sucked.
You guys, listen.

17:17.724 --> 17:19.492
Cley has a plan,
all right?

17:19.528 --> 17:21.929
His initial interrogation didn't
work, so he put us together

17:21.963 --> 17:24.332
like this for one reason,
and that's so we can find out

17:24.366 --> 17:27.435
amongst ourselves
who the traitor is.

17:27.469 --> 17:28.769
- There is no traitor.
- Well...

17:28.804 --> 17:30.638
Obviously they think there is.

17:30.673 --> 17:34.042
And what if we don't?

17:34.076 --> 17:36.044
If you don't,
I'll have no choice.

17:36.078 --> 17:39.815
I'll send every one of you
to building seven.

17:39.849 --> 17:41.883
He can't do that.

17:41.918 --> 17:44.553
Do I even want to know?

17:44.587 --> 17:46.421
Building seven, it's...

17:46.455 --> 17:48.390
Where they send
the worst of the worst.

17:48.425 --> 17:50.659
And once an Alpha goes in...

17:50.693 --> 17:53.395
They never come out.

18:00.562 --> 18:01.938
We'll get out of this,
okay?

18:02.217 --> 18:03.818
What do you think
they do in building seven?

18:03.852 --> 18:05.553
Seriously, Nina,
when I dream about it,

18:05.587 --> 18:07.355
I'm on some sort of
a metal table.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.357
And there are these shadowy
figures with sharp objects,

18:09.392 --> 18:10.592
but I can't see them.

18:10.627 --> 18:12.828
Even with my ability,
I can't see them.

18:12.863 --> 18:14.630
Rachel, are you gonna sit here
and talk about your damn dreams?

18:14.665 --> 18:15.865
We need to be figuring out

18:15.899 --> 18:17.066
how the hell we're gonna
get out of here.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.367
- Bill, not helping.
- Yeah...

18:18.401 --> 18:19.568
Pissing and moaning's
really helping.

18:19.603 --> 18:20.803
Harken, you're amped up.
Just chill out.

18:20.837 --> 18:22.404
I'm in Binghamton, okay?

18:22.438 --> 18:23.773
And my wife doesn't
know where I am.

18:23.807 --> 18:26.042
I've no idea when we're
going to get out of here.

18:26.076 --> 18:27.810
So it's a little more
than just being amped up.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.446
Okay, you know what, Bill?
You need to please calm down.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.615
You Dr. Rosen now?

18:31.649 --> 18:34.050
We all need to calm down.

18:34.085 --> 18:35.753
Bill doesn't like
being in jail.

18:35.787 --> 18:37.087
He likes putting people
in jail.

18:37.122 --> 18:38.789
It's two different things.

18:38.824 --> 18:40.692
All right, Bill,
you're a cop, so--

18:40.726 --> 18:42.994
I am a Special Agent.
There's a difference.

18:43.028 --> 18:44.495
All right.

18:44.530 --> 18:46.264
Now what I want to know is,
does this actually work?

18:46.298 --> 18:48.466
You put your suspects in a room
and you see who breaks.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.234
It works all the time.

18:50.269 --> 18:52.103
You put the suspects
in a room just like this.

18:52.137 --> 18:53.605
You make them sweat,
and then you watch them wait.

18:53.639 --> 18:56.540
- Wait for what?
- You wait to see who's calm.

18:56.575 --> 18:59.344
It's usually the calm guy
that's guilty.

19:02.747 --> 19:06.017
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

19:06.051 --> 19:07.618
Well, Bill is never calm.

19:07.652 --> 19:10.487
He can't be calm.
It's biologically impossible.

19:10.522 --> 19:12.924
- And Rachel's always nervous.
- Hey.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.726
And I'm agitated and have
a bad attitude.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.561
So we're innocent.

19:17.596 --> 19:19.430
The three of us are innocent.
Let's go.

19:19.464 --> 19:21.265
Bill, come on.
You can drive me home.

19:21.299 --> 19:22.800
Gary...

19:22.834 --> 19:24.668
No, come on.
I'm opening the door.

19:24.703 --> 19:26.237
Gary, they're not just going
to let us out, okay.

19:26.271 --> 19:28.139
And plus it's more than just
seeing who sweats.

19:28.173 --> 19:31.008
Cley's got Eric Letrobe
with him.

19:31.042 --> 19:33.744
One of your ex-patients, Doc?

19:33.779 --> 19:36.046
No, not exactly.

19:36.081 --> 19:39.016
An Alpha we found.
He reads faces.

19:39.050 --> 19:43.119
He uses his ability to con
people and win at poker games.

19:43.154 --> 19:45.088
Perfect...

19:45.122 --> 19:46.422
Hey, Eric!

19:46.457 --> 19:47.623
How's life treating you
in here, huh?

19:47.658 --> 19:49.558
Nice and comfy?

19:49.593 --> 19:50.960
The food's crap.

19:50.994 --> 19:52.861
I've had it before.
It's not that bad.

19:52.896 --> 19:54.730
Look me in the eye
and say that.

20:01.239 --> 20:03.306
- Oh! Ah!
- You all right?

20:03.341 --> 20:05.776
Ah, I just...
Eh, it's my back.

20:05.810 --> 20:07.878
That dam cot is just--

20:07.913 --> 20:09.981
Okay, you know what, we need
to get him out of here now.

20:10.015 --> 20:13.985
Yes, I think we--we all
need to get out of here.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.835
Okay.

20:35.004 --> 20:37.072
Oh, this is not all right.

20:37.107 --> 20:39.775
All right, we need
a doctor in here now.

20:39.809 --> 20:42.611
She's worried,
and the pain is real.

20:42.645 --> 20:44.646
Wonderful.

20:51.722 --> 20:53.189
Ah, my back is out.

20:53.224 --> 20:56.526
I need
a spasmolytic methocarbamol.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.127
Okay, his muscles
are in spasm.

20:58.161 --> 20:59.628
Let's get him down to medical.

20:59.662 --> 21:00.796
Can I get a gurney, please.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.431
Put the rest of them
in their cells.

21:02.465 --> 21:03.932
Let's go.

21:03.966 --> 21:05.967
Yeah, I'm going.

21:11.474 --> 21:13.208
Hey, don't touch me!

21:13.242 --> 21:15.109
No one's supposed
to touch me.

21:15.144 --> 21:16.778
Hey, tell them to be careful
with Dr. Rosen, okay.

21:16.812 --> 21:18.313
He's in pain.
Just keep moving.

21:18.347 --> 21:20.916
You're making
a serious mistake.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.853
Hey!

21:23.887 --> 21:25.822
Eyes front.

21:38.103 --> 21:40.070
Come on, pal.
This is no time to act stupid.

21:40.105 --> 21:42.039
Got all the time
in the world.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.309
That's the best you can do?

21:46.344 --> 21:49.078
Get in.
Get in!

21:49.112 --> 21:52.014
Unh!

21:53.050 --> 21:54.583
They're all the same.

21:58.855 --> 22:00.689
Aah!

22:00.724 --> 22:05.060
Go to sleep.

22:05.095 --> 22:07.229
Let's go!

22:10.934 --> 22:12.834
Lock it down now.

22:22.745 --> 22:24.446
I hear someone.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.613
Okay, they're coming
from the hall.

22:28.784 --> 22:30.119
- Ah!
- Let's go.

22:30.153 --> 22:31.219
Thank you, doctor.

22:31.254 --> 22:33.688
I'll get the medication
on the way out.

22:33.723 --> 22:36.925
The pain was real, but I guess
he was exaggerating a bit.

22:36.959 --> 22:38.260
Really.

22:44.067 --> 22:46.068
Aah!

22:55.713 --> 22:58.214
Come on, come on,
come on.

22:58.248 --> 23:01.317
Come on.

23:01.351 --> 23:04.353
We gotta hurry up,
because they're inside, coming.

23:11.527 --> 23:14.027
Say the word.
Who do I drop?

23:20.223 --> 23:22.223
Say the word.

23:23.311 --> 23:25.512
They're all within range.
I just need a target.

23:31.954 --> 23:36.224
Stand down.

23:36.259 --> 23:38.527
You're letting them go?

23:38.562 --> 23:41.130
Six assets, one traitor.

23:41.164 --> 23:43.900
I'm not a wasteful man.

23:43.934 --> 23:46.502
We'll adjust.

23:56.678 --> 23:58.712
The FBI busted
a smuggling ring out of here.

23:58.747 --> 24:00.681
Some Somali gun runners.

24:00.715 --> 24:03.049
This place has been vacant
ever since.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.651
Yes, well, are you certain

24:04.685 --> 24:06.553
no one will think
to look for us here?

24:06.587 --> 24:09.388
Wasn't my case, so I shouldn't
be tracked to this.

24:09.423 --> 24:12.124
Hicks, I need you to secure
the rest of these exits.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.525
I'm on it.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.329
Gary, what do you see?

24:16.363 --> 24:18.698
There's wireless
cameras far away.

24:18.732 --> 24:22.402
There's some trucks' CBS,
radio--there's Wi-Fi.

24:22.436 --> 24:24.470
There's satellite TV.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.572
All right.
Doors are chained shut.

24:26.606 --> 24:27.973
Now what, Bill?

24:28.008 --> 24:29.608
I'm not heading back
to Binghamton.

24:29.643 --> 24:31.210
We need to keep moving
or split up.

24:31.244 --> 24:32.678
Give ourselves a chance
to get away.

24:32.712 --> 24:34.446
Get away to where?

24:34.480 --> 24:38.383
Can't go home, can't go back
to the offices.

24:38.417 --> 24:40.117
Ah!

24:40.152 --> 24:42.052
Nobody's going anywhere
until we figure out

24:42.087 --> 24:43.220
who this traitor is.

24:43.255 --> 24:45.088
We don't even know
there is one.

24:45.123 --> 24:46.757
Hicks, there are
three people dead,

24:46.791 --> 24:47.925
and they were lured
to their death

24:47.959 --> 24:49.260
by calls from our office.

24:49.294 --> 24:50.461
So unless it's the UPS guy,

24:50.495 --> 24:51.863
it's gotta be somebody
in this room.

24:51.897 --> 24:53.464
No, it couldn't be
the UPS guy.

24:53.499 --> 24:55.567
The MK Ultra files
are on the cloud server.

24:55.601 --> 24:57.269
You have to have a password
to get on there.

24:57.303 --> 24:58.637
Did you guys look at
those poor old men?

24:58.672 --> 25:00.139
It was horrible.

25:00.174 --> 25:02.642
I wouldn't too many tears.
Did you read those files?

25:02.676 --> 25:04.978
Human experimentation,
forced drug trials.

25:05.012 --> 25:06.846
They didn't exactly treat their
patients with kid gloves.

25:06.881 --> 25:09.849
Then you're admitting that you
had access to these files.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.584
Yeah, Bill, I read the files.

25:11.618 --> 25:13.552
They're on the server.
I read everything on there.

25:13.587 --> 25:14.720
Yeah, I read them too, Bill.

25:14.755 --> 25:16.088
I feel so left out.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.990
I basically use it
to check box scores.

25:18.024 --> 25:19.792
You want us to believe
that you're the only one

25:19.826 --> 25:21.726
that didn't have access
to these files?

25:21.761 --> 25:23.128
Sorry to disappoint.

25:23.162 --> 25:24.596
But you know, I can tell you
the era and the whip

25:24.630 --> 25:25.797
for the entire Giants
pitching staff.

25:25.831 --> 25:27.231
Fear the beard.

25:27.266 --> 25:29.200
I don't know what that means,
Hicks, come on.

25:29.235 --> 25:31.169
Okay, so what now?

25:31.203 --> 25:32.637
We interrogate each other?

25:32.672 --> 25:35.074
Oh, Nina, you can push
everybody.

25:35.108 --> 25:36.809
- Rachel--
- No, that would work.

25:36.843 --> 25:38.644
'Cause you couldn't push me.

25:38.679 --> 25:40.246
And, Nina, you can't push
yourself, can you?

25:40.280 --> 25:41.715
That wouldn't make sense.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.617
No, it doesn't make
any sense.

25:43.651 --> 25:46.487
Bill's in overdrive.
He can probably ignore you.

25:46.521 --> 25:47.788
And I've spent eight years

25:47.822 --> 25:51.592
learning how to avoid
your influence, so...

25:52.794 --> 25:54.094
Are you still
hurting, Dr. Rosen?

25:54.129 --> 25:57.531
Nothing that a swim
and a hot bath

25:57.566 --> 25:59.066
and a good night's sleep
won't cure.

25:59.101 --> 26:00.902
I know how to find
the traitor.

26:00.936 --> 26:02.203
- What?
- How?

26:02.237 --> 26:04.072
Get me a phone,
then I'll call Anna.

26:04.106 --> 26:06.841
You're gonna ask the head of
Red Flag who the informant is.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.642
Yeah, I'll ask Anna.

26:08.677 --> 26:09.911
This Anna thing, we're really
gonna need to talk about.

26:09.945 --> 26:11.145
Gary, you can't talk
to Anna.

26:11.179 --> 26:13.147
Hey, guys, guys,
I got this, okay?

26:13.181 --> 26:14.982
I've interrogated hundreds of
suspects in the past, okay.

26:15.017 --> 26:16.418
It's very simple.

26:16.452 --> 26:18.586
You just go through the last
few days, you make a timeline.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.221
Good old-fashioned
police work, all right.

26:20.255 --> 26:22.089
Now I don't need any mind
control to do it.

26:22.123 --> 26:25.492
Nobody needs mind control
or anything like that

26:25.526 --> 26:27.795
as I know
who the traitor is.

26:34.869 --> 26:37.504
Yeah?

26:37.539 --> 26:38.539
You found them?

26:38.573 --> 26:41.208
Scranton.

26:41.242 --> 26:44.811
All right, send
the coordinates to my phone.

26:44.846 --> 26:47.014
I say you could touch
the station?

26:47.048 --> 26:50.450
That is some
misplaced hostility.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.390
Doc, come on.

26:56.424 --> 26:58.892
Are you gonna tell us,
or are you gonna make us guess?

26:58.927 --> 27:00.861
I'm trying to decide
how to handle this.

27:00.895 --> 27:03.030
It's not easy.

27:03.064 --> 27:06.067
I care about all of you.

27:06.101 --> 27:08.236
And to be honest,
I'm deeply disappointed.

27:08.270 --> 27:10.070
Well, it wasn't me.

27:10.105 --> 27:12.573
I didn't do it, so it must be
someone else here.

27:12.607 --> 27:14.175
Gary doesn't lie.

27:14.209 --> 27:15.176
We all know Gary
doesn't lie.

27:15.210 --> 27:16.544
No, I do lie.

27:16.578 --> 27:18.446
I've been practicing.
It's a social skill.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.747
Like the other day
when I said I was

27:19.781 --> 27:21.148
going to have a pudding pop.

27:21.183 --> 27:23.184
I was lying, 'cause I don't
like pudding pops.

27:23.218 --> 27:24.718
That was a lie.
I do like pudding pops.

27:24.753 --> 27:25.853
Gary...

27:25.887 --> 27:27.821
I just knew
we didn't have any.

27:27.856 --> 27:31.091
Well, I'm hoping
that the traitor

27:31.126 --> 27:33.160
will, for lack
of a better word, confess.

27:33.195 --> 27:34.895
- Cley's almost here.
- What?

27:34.929 --> 27:36.196
- He's on the phone.
- How?

27:36.230 --> 27:37.631
There's a spy satellite
tracking us.

27:37.665 --> 27:39.199
Gary, you just telling us
this now?

27:39.233 --> 27:41.201
Yeah, I just found out right
now, Bill.

27:41.235 --> 27:42.335
He's on his way.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.103
- All right, Doc.
- 20 minutes away.

27:44.138 --> 27:45.505
Okay, we should run.
Steal another car.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.540
Seriously, I can't go back to
Binghamton, Dr. Rosen.

27:47.575 --> 27:49.109
I can't do it.

27:49.143 --> 27:51.144
Running away would be
pointless, obviously.

27:51.178 --> 27:55.382
So, if the person, whoever
is responsible for this,

27:55.416 --> 27:59.186
would step forward, I'll know
that they are redeemable.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.789
And I will do everything
that I can to protect them.

28:01.824 --> 28:03.258
If not, I have
no other choice

28:03.292 --> 28:06.628
but to turn them over
to Cley myself.

28:06.662 --> 28:08.963
And we, uh,
have 20 minutes.

28:08.998 --> 28:11.065
No, we have
less than 20 minutes.

28:23.478 --> 28:27.281
Yep, this is
the car they stole.

28:27.315 --> 28:28.716
Satellite lost track

28:28.750 --> 28:30.752
when they moved into
the industrial park.

28:30.786 --> 28:34.790
Well, there have to be 40
or 50 warehouses around here.

28:34.824 --> 28:37.459
- Anything?
- Noise.

28:37.494 --> 28:39.428
Between the train depot and
the factories down the street,

28:39.463 --> 28:40.730
there's too much clatter.

28:40.764 --> 28:42.498
They're cornered.

28:42.532 --> 28:44.267
Eventually they always
end up cornered.

28:44.301 --> 28:45.735
We'll go warehouse
to warehouse.

28:45.769 --> 28:47.470
Hunt them down, flesh them out,
take them down.

28:47.504 --> 28:50.139
Start all over
again with Eric.

28:50.173 --> 28:51.874
Sooner or later,
one of them will crack.

28:51.909 --> 28:53.676
All right,
I'll wait here.

28:53.710 --> 28:55.144
You come and get me
if you find them.

28:55.179 --> 28:58.080
- Nope.
- Man, where's the trust?

28:58.114 --> 29:01.316
You can tell what people are
thinking, who do you trust?

29:01.351 --> 29:03.385
Let's go.

29:06.489 --> 29:11.026
Okay, whoever did this,
just come forward and confess.

29:11.060 --> 29:12.060
I promise
we will forgive you.

29:12.095 --> 29:13.328
Doc says he already
knows who it is.

29:13.363 --> 29:14.530
So why don't you can
the theatrics.

29:14.564 --> 29:15.931
Hey, what is that
supposed to mean?

29:15.966 --> 29:17.466
It means stop babbling!

29:17.501 --> 29:18.668
Cameron, just dial it down
a bit, okay?

29:18.702 --> 29:21.838
You're looking
pretty jumpy there, Hicks.

29:21.872 --> 29:23.372
Says a guy who's sweatin'
through his shirt?

29:23.407 --> 29:25.208
Yeah, I sweat, okay?
I sweat when I'm amped up, okay?

29:25.242 --> 29:26.809
You're amped up.

29:26.844 --> 29:28.377
Maybe crush a crate.
Maybe that'll help you.

29:28.412 --> 29:29.478
Yeah, how about
I crush you?

29:29.513 --> 29:30.946
Guys, guys,
I can hear headsets.

29:30.980 --> 29:32.247
They're searching for us.

29:32.282 --> 29:34.116
They're going
to be here very soon.

29:34.150 --> 29:36.685
Hey, is there a bathroom
around here?

29:36.720 --> 29:38.287
Hey, it's my downside.

29:38.321 --> 29:40.722
When I get nervous
I have to pee.

29:40.756 --> 29:43.024
No, your downside is you're
a distrustful, depressed

29:43.059 --> 29:44.726
miserable human being.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.862
Oh, yeah.
That.

29:47.896 --> 29:50.565
You know
what people don't realize?

29:50.599 --> 29:52.300
That ignorance of what other
people are thinking

29:52.334 --> 29:53.801
is one of the keys
to human happiness.

29:53.836 --> 29:56.504
Lets you have friends, lovers.

29:56.538 --> 29:58.005
Lets you keep a job.

29:58.040 --> 30:01.609
You know, they told me this
office thing was a fast-track

30:01.643 --> 30:03.677
to a cushy position in D.C.

30:03.711 --> 30:05.846
House in the burbs,
good schools for my kids.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.882
Still livin'
in upstate New York.

30:07.916 --> 30:09.917
I feel your pain, brother.

30:09.951 --> 30:12.420
Somehow that didn't make me
feel any better.

30:12.454 --> 30:15.256
Come on, let's get this done.

30:15.290 --> 30:19.761
So, people, time's up.

30:19.795 --> 30:24.166
Okay, so who is it?

30:24.200 --> 30:26.635
He doesn't know.

30:26.669 --> 30:28.337
You're bluffing, right?

30:28.371 --> 30:29.371
Look,
for all we know, it's Cley.

30:29.405 --> 30:31.039
Or someone above his head.

30:31.074 --> 30:33.509
Someone is setting us up
to take the fall.

30:33.543 --> 30:34.777
It can't be Cley.

30:34.811 --> 30:36.278
He doesn't have access
to our passwords--

30:36.313 --> 30:37.513
he doesn't have access
that we know of.

30:37.547 --> 30:39.782
He doesn't have access,
Hicks.

30:39.816 --> 30:43.018
She's right.
It's not Cley.

30:43.052 --> 30:46.088
- I'm sorry, Cameron.
- What?

30:46.122 --> 30:49.892
I know about the cash deposits
to your secret accounts.

30:49.926 --> 30:54.464
Gary told me.

30:54.499 --> 30:56.100
Hicks.

30:56.134 --> 30:57.534
The deposits are cash,

30:57.569 --> 30:59.403
but they email statements.

30:59.437 --> 31:01.139
And its different amounts.

31:01.173 --> 31:04.109
- There's $3,120, $1,960.
- No, listen to me.

31:04.143 --> 31:07.712
You don't understand.
Different times of the month.

31:07.746 --> 31:08.879
It's for my kid.

31:08.914 --> 31:09.980
Cameron.

31:10.015 --> 31:12.016
No.

31:14.953 --> 31:16.754
Seem pretty nervous there,
Hicks.

31:16.788 --> 31:18.956
Yeah, you're damn right
I am.

31:18.990 --> 31:23.393
I should have never let you
on this team in the first place.

31:23.428 --> 31:26.429
Should have sent him to
Binghamton a long time ago.

31:33.126 --> 31:35.644
I knew it.
I knew it was you.

31:43.092 --> 31:45.694
- Bill, don't!
- No, no, no!

31:50.767 --> 31:53.201
That's enough!
Just let him go, please.

31:53.235 --> 31:54.869
Unh!

31:54.904 --> 31:56.204
Are you okay?

31:56.239 --> 31:58.106
Bill!

31:58.140 --> 32:00.074
I didn't do it.

32:00.108 --> 32:03.310
- Bill!
- Aah!

32:03.345 --> 32:04.912
No, no, no, no!

32:04.946 --> 32:07.949
Bill!

32:14.322 --> 32:15.922
Bill!

32:15.957 --> 32:17.824
Stop fighting!

32:17.858 --> 32:19.559
Hicks, stop!

32:26.165 --> 32:28.166
Unh!

32:40.013 --> 32:41.522
- Get on the ground!
- Get down!

32:41.523 --> 32:42.957
Hands up!
Down on the ground.

32:42.991 --> 32:44.325
It's Hicks.

32:44.359 --> 32:46.094
I need to get Gary
out of here.

32:46.128 --> 32:48.029
- Get him on the ground!
- It's not him!

32:48.064 --> 32:49.398
Back up! Back up!

32:49.432 --> 32:52.367
It's not Hicks, okay,
it's not him.

32:52.401 --> 32:54.269
Dr. Rosen, they were
fighting each other.

32:54.304 --> 32:55.504
I know.
Come on, Gary.

32:55.538 --> 33:01.041
Friends aren't
supposed to fight.

33:01.076 --> 33:03.077
Hey, Doc, remember me?

33:03.111 --> 33:06.513
Not now.

33:06.547 --> 33:09.849
- Down on the ground now.
- Okay, stop, everybody.

33:09.883 --> 33:11.885
It's Rosen.
He's the mole.

33:11.919 --> 33:13.286
What are you talking about.
Rosen just said it was Hicks.

33:13.321 --> 33:15.122
That man is an imposter.

33:15.156 --> 33:18.492
His blood type is wrong.
That's not Dr. Rosen.

33:28.304 --> 33:30.539
Oh, God, he's got Gary.

34:20.489 --> 34:24.159
About time.

34:24.194 --> 34:27.629
You know what they call it
when you die in your sleep?

34:27.663 --> 34:30.532
Millionaire's death.

34:30.565 --> 34:33.969
Creighton wanted you alive
to take the fall.

34:34.003 --> 34:35.370
Looks like that's changed.

34:35.404 --> 34:37.272
I love to improvise.

34:42.578 --> 34:44.545
Uh!

34:54.857 --> 34:57.359
Oh...

35:07.204 --> 35:10.440
Dr. Rosen, we should go back
and help our friends.

35:10.474 --> 35:12.809
Gary, I've told you
we are helping them.

35:12.843 --> 35:16.212
And the best way to do that is
to erase the MK Ultra files

35:16.246 --> 35:18.247
from the cloud server--

35:18.282 --> 35:20.883
But you said the MK Ultra
files are important.

35:20.917 --> 35:22.485
They are.

35:22.519 --> 35:24.820
And you're the only one
who can do that.

35:24.854 --> 35:26.722
Yeah, well if they're
important, why delete them?

35:26.756 --> 35:29.157
It doesn't make--

35:29.191 --> 35:30.458
Oh, that's gross.

35:30.492 --> 35:31.759
Dr. Rosen,
don't do that in there.

35:31.793 --> 35:34.128
- Are you sick?
- No, I'm fine.

35:34.162 --> 35:35.930
No, you're not fine.

35:35.964 --> 35:38.232
Vomit is the body's way of
telling us we're not fine.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.668
Do you ever shut up?
Come on, Gary.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.670
But that won't grow anymore
now, Dr. Rosen.

35:42.704 --> 35:46.274
It's delicate.
It's a philodendron.

35:46.308 --> 35:48.510
Come on.
Come on, Gary.

35:53.248 --> 35:54.715
Gary...

35:54.750 --> 35:57.217
Yeah, it got warm.

36:00.522 --> 36:02.756
How long
is this going to take?

36:02.790 --> 36:04.090
To erase every file
all at once?

36:04.125 --> 36:05.125
It'll take a while.

36:05.159 --> 36:07.160
'Cause the connection's slow.

36:07.194 --> 36:08.861
And the IP address,
it keeps changing.

36:08.896 --> 36:10.697
That's why I'm the only one
who can delete them all,

36:10.731 --> 36:12.298
because I'm the admin.

36:16.972 --> 36:18.973
Don't do that
in the plant.

36:19.007 --> 36:20.375
Go and do that
in the bathroom.

36:20.409 --> 36:23.111
Don't worry about me.
Just concentrate on your work.

36:23.145 --> 36:27.717
Gary?

36:27.751 --> 36:30.286
Step away from that man.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.121
He's not me.

36:37.996 --> 36:40.474
No. No.
No.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.586
You're not Dr. Rosen.

36:41.621 --> 36:43.054
Your hair is too short.

36:43.089 --> 36:45.990
I know, Gary.

36:46.025 --> 36:47.925
He must have cut it.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.527
Why I don't know.

36:49.561 --> 36:51.795
To measure my skull,
to match the color of my hair.

36:51.830 --> 36:53.797
It's not important, Gary.

36:53.831 --> 36:55.432
What's important is
that this man...

36:55.466 --> 36:56.866
This man's an Alpha.

36:56.900 --> 36:58.168
Don't listen to him.

36:58.202 --> 36:59.469
That's the only
possible explanation

36:59.503 --> 37:00.737
for how he looks like me.

37:00.771 --> 37:03.507
No, no, he...

37:03.541 --> 37:05.275
His face is moving.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.845
Yeah, you're not Dr. Rosen.

37:07.879 --> 37:08.946
That's his Alpha ability.

37:08.981 --> 37:09.947
He can change his face.

37:09.982 --> 37:11.516
Yes, you're right, Gary.

37:11.550 --> 37:13.218
And his entire
bone structure.

37:13.252 --> 37:16.388
And even the color
of his skin, his vocal cords.

37:16.422 --> 37:18.189
I imagine it must be
incredibly painful

37:18.224 --> 37:19.557
holding another shape
like this.

37:19.591 --> 37:22.126
It's no picnic being you,
that's for sure.

37:22.160 --> 37:26.229
All hunched up, pretending
to be so damned understanding.

37:26.264 --> 37:30.300
Well, why don't you
let it go?

37:30.334 --> 37:31.935
I'll kill him,
you little brat!

37:31.969 --> 37:33.970
No, no, no, you won't
because you need me to delete

37:34.005 --> 37:35.238
those MK Ultra files.

37:35.272 --> 37:37.039
But I won't.

37:37.074 --> 37:39.542
I'm not going to help you
because you helped Red Flag

37:39.576 --> 37:41.044
kill those three
MK Ultra people.

37:41.078 --> 37:42.945
Three of them!

37:42.980 --> 37:46.816
You killed Freeman,
Baxter and and Stentz?

37:46.850 --> 37:49.485
Yeah, they're dead.
I saw the pictures.

37:49.519 --> 37:50.887
They were
the last three remaining

37:50.921 --> 37:52.989
staff members of the program.

37:53.023 --> 37:55.925
While you make me out
to be a traitor,

37:55.959 --> 37:58.561
you wipe out MK Ultra...

37:58.595 --> 38:01.897
Why?

38:01.932 --> 38:04.634
What's in those files?

38:04.668 --> 38:07.270
What is it you don't want
me to see?

38:07.304 --> 38:08.805
- Stop!
- No, no, no, no!

38:16.146 --> 38:17.947
- Dr. Rosen...
- Gary!

38:17.982 --> 38:20.016
- Dr. Rosen's got a gun.
- Where is he?

38:20.050 --> 38:21.984
I don't know what he's going
to do, but he's the mole.

38:22.019 --> 38:23.486
He's down there.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.720
I don't know what he's going
to try and do,

38:24.755 --> 38:27.256
but he's the mole.
Gary, just slow down.

38:27.291 --> 38:28.591
Anna told me.
We should leave.

38:28.625 --> 38:31.427
That's not Gary!

38:31.462 --> 38:34.564
Oh! Ah!

38:36.567 --> 38:38.000
Oh, God.

38:38.035 --> 38:40.103
I'm so damned tired.

38:40.137 --> 38:41.938
Look, I'm not the traitor here,
all right?

38:41.972 --> 38:43.172
You all are.

38:43.207 --> 38:44.507
You've sided against
your own kind.

38:44.541 --> 38:46.242
And now you're nothing
but government thugs.

38:46.276 --> 38:48.377
Was that necessary?

38:48.412 --> 38:50.179
No, but you know what,
it feels really good.

38:50.213 --> 38:51.881
Where is Gary?

38:51.915 --> 38:53.649
I'm here.

38:53.683 --> 38:55.717
It's the real me.
That's the fake me.

38:55.752 --> 38:59.154
He was fake Rosen before, but
the real Dr. Rosen is here now.

38:59.188 --> 39:01.823
His leg hurts,
and he has bad hair.

39:05.261 --> 39:07.129
So the Alpha
who tried to kill me?

39:07.163 --> 39:09.164
Gone by the time
we got there.

39:09.198 --> 39:11.399
But your theory
seems sound.

39:11.434 --> 39:13.868
Kill the MK Ultra players,
erase the data,

39:13.903 --> 39:15.737
leave you holding the bag.

39:15.771 --> 39:18.173
Yeah, well whatever
Red Flag was looking for

39:18.207 --> 39:21.043
in those MK Ultra files,

39:21.078 --> 39:23.780
or whatever
they were trying to bury,

39:23.814 --> 39:26.116
must have been
pretty important.

39:26.150 --> 39:27.752
Important enough
for that morphogene

39:27.786 --> 39:28.853
to risk his life for it.

39:28.887 --> 39:31.355
True believer.

39:31.390 --> 39:34.058
Had him shipped straight
to building seven.

39:34.093 --> 39:38.897
Eric, why exactly
are you here?

39:38.931 --> 39:40.365
His idea.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.268
Eric's getting out of
Binghamton soon.

39:42.302 --> 39:45.138
I thought you two could work
together from time to time.

39:45.172 --> 39:46.272
Oh, really.

39:46.306 --> 39:48.173
Call it work release.

39:48.208 --> 39:51.343
Hey, he meant that.

39:51.377 --> 39:53.778
That was sincere.

39:53.813 --> 39:56.514
It's like...we bonded.

39:56.549 --> 39:57.882
Don't push it.

39:57.916 --> 40:01.353
Hey, Doc,
I'm--I'm your man.

40:01.388 --> 40:03.723
Even part time, freelance.

40:03.757 --> 40:05.592
Well, I'll keep it
in mind, Eric.

40:05.626 --> 40:07.361
More honesty.

40:07.395 --> 40:11.365
That is...
It's so refreshing.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.768
All right.
I'll be in the car.

40:13.803 --> 40:15.203
Don't try to run.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.338
Why would I run?

40:16.373 --> 40:18.374
I got a job offer waiting.

40:22.212 --> 40:25.447
You know, Nathan,
I was a little dismayed

40:25.482 --> 40:28.684
at the way
you treated my team.

40:28.718 --> 40:31.454
Tranqing them like
they were rabid dogs.

40:31.488 --> 40:34.257
Throwing them into cages.

40:34.291 --> 40:37.026
You set a very dangerous
precedent doing that.

40:37.060 --> 40:39.830
Lee, you had a mole.

40:39.864 --> 40:42.900
A Red Flag Agent
inside your team.

40:42.934 --> 40:44.602
If I hadn't acted quickly
and decisively,

40:44.636 --> 40:46.171
you would have been dead
or framed.

40:46.205 --> 40:48.707
Or both.

40:48.741 --> 40:50.876
And I'm supposed to
thank you for that?

40:50.911 --> 40:52.611
You could.

40:52.646 --> 40:53.879
Or you could worry
about how Red Flag

40:53.914 --> 40:55.581
is gonna come at you next.

40:55.616 --> 40:58.484
Because they will.

41:07.492 --> 41:10.494
Rachel.
I'll call you.

41:16.367 --> 41:18.502
Well, I thought
he was pretty cute.

41:18.536 --> 41:19.636
Really?

41:19.671 --> 41:20.838
Yeah, those bank deposits
were cash.

41:20.872 --> 41:22.607
That's the beauty
of card shows.

41:22.641 --> 41:24.475
Look, I'm the guy who pitched
two perfect games in a row.

41:24.510 --> 41:26.778
Yeah,
in the minor leagues.

41:26.812 --> 41:29.482
It doesn't matter.
Never been done before.

41:29.516 --> 41:31.684
Hasn't been done since.
Makes me collectible.

41:31.718 --> 41:33.953
I'm a statistical freak.

41:33.987 --> 41:36.823
No, that makes you
the greatest flameout

41:36.857 --> 41:39.692
in the history of...
Minor league sports.

41:39.726 --> 41:41.527
Regardless, I get
20 bucks an autograph.

41:41.561 --> 41:43.829
I do five or seven
shows a year.

41:43.863 --> 41:46.498
My shame is Tyler's
college fund.

41:46.533 --> 41:47.990
At least you two
are talking again.

41:48.015 --> 41:49.423
Ah, we're one big happy family.

41:49.448 --> 41:50.807
Yeah, and still waiting
on my apology.

41:50.832 --> 41:53.574
Dr. Rosen still owns me
two more vacation days.

41:53.599 --> 41:56.315
And, uh, there's
a motor show in Detroit.

41:56.340 --> 41:57.540
We should go.

41:57.565 --> 41:58.825
It could be
a roadtrip, and then

41:58.850 --> 42:00.792
while we're there you could
pick out a new car.

42:01.253 --> 42:02.453
Gary, what's wrong with my car?

42:02.478 --> 42:04.028
Your driving
an accountant's car.

42:04.053 --> 42:05.597
So, you know what,
that's not funny.

42:05.622 --> 42:07.216
You know what,
why don't you get

42:07.241 --> 42:08.441
your little girlfriend
Anna to take you?

42:08.466 --> 42:09.666
Hey, be nice.

42:10.123 --> 42:11.323
What? I'm being nice.

42:11.348 --> 42:12.070
She's just my friend.

42:12.071 --> 42:15.557
Look, I say one snarky thing
and you guys are all on my ass.

42:15.582 --> 42:17.867
Forget it, I can say
whatever I want.

42:20.211 --> 42:21.411
Bill? Bill?

42:22.441 --> 42:23.641
Bill?

42:23.965 --> 42:25.165
Dr. Rosen?
Dr. Rosen!

42:25.190 --> 42:26.057
Bill.

42:26.082 --> 42:27.282
Dr. Rosen!
