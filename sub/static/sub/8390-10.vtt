00:01.340 --> 00:03.513

PROPERTY THAT I WANT YOU TO SEE.

00:03.550 --> 00:04.960
HOW THE HELL
WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW

00:05.000 --> 00:06.137
THERE WAS GONNA BE A BUBBLE?

00:06.170 --> 00:08.206
- DOES THIS MEAN
YOU MIGHT LOSE THE HOUSE?

00:08.240 --> 00:09.207
YOU HAVE TO TELL MOM.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.241
- DADDY, THIS IS STEVE.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.929

00:12.970 --> 00:15.029
I SWEAR, THIS KID'S GOT,
LIKE, EIGHT HANDS.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.002

00:17.050 --> 00:18.039
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

00:18.080 --> 00:20.287

00:33.130 --> 00:35.121
TO THE SETTING SUN

00:35.170 --> 00:37.161
- ONE SECOND, HONEY.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.441
HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.232
MOMMY WILL BE
RIGHT THERE.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.032
HURRY UP.
- [whispers indistinctly]

00:43.070 --> 00:44.139
- NO, JUST HURRY UP.

00:44.180 --> 00:45.204
[knocking on door]

00:45.250 --> 00:47.036
GO, GO, GO, GO,

01:04.060 --> 01:06.847
- OKAY, MAX,
HIS NAME IS NOEL,

01:06.890 --> 01:08.676
AND HE'S A REAL
INTERESTING KID.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.789
- YEAH.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.957
- AND, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT--
YOU MIGHT LIKE HIM.

01:11.000 --> 01:11.921
- UH-HUH.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.643
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE COULD
BECOME A FRIEND.

01:13.690 --> 01:14.964
- WHY DO I NEED A FRIEND?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.820
- 'CAUSE FRIENDS ARE FUN.
- YOU DON'T NEED A FRIEND.

01:16.860 --> 01:19.317
- CAN YOU GIVE ME A REASON
WHY FRIENDS ARE FUN?

01:19.350 --> 01:20.203
- UH...

01:20.250 --> 01:21.512
- THEY'RE FUN
BECAUSE THEY'RE FRIENDS.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.175
- YEAH.
- AND FRIENDS ARE FRIENDS.

01:23.220 --> 01:25.427
IN ORDER TO BE A FRIEND,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FRIEND.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.189
- YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S JUST TRY
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.073
HI.
- HI.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.497
- IT'S ALL ABOUT
A LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY.

01:30.530 --> 01:32.327
- UH-HUH.
- HERE, GIVE IT A SHOT.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.942
- OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- NO, GO ON.

01:34.990 --> 01:37.197
- ALL RIGHT.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.573
- BUT NO, HE COMES TO THE HOUSE,
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

01:39.610 --> 01:40.429
- THAT'S GREAT.

01:40.470 --> 01:42.358
- AM I TALKING TOO MUCH
ABOUT NOEL?

01:42.410 --> 01:44.298
I TRY TO THINK ABOUT OTHER
THINGS, BUT IT'S JUST THAT

01:44.340 --> 01:45.682
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

01:45.720 --> 01:47.608
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- IT'S JUST SO GOOD FOR HIM.

01:47.650 --> 01:48.890
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T GET A LOT OF--
- HEY, HONEY?

01:48.930 --> 01:49.965
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.444
UM, CAN YOU GO CHECK
ON THE KIDS FOR A MINUTE?

01:51.490 --> 01:53.344
- YEAH, YEAH.
UH-HUH, I'M ON IT.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.690
HEY, GUYS,
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:56.730 --> 01:57.628
- [groans]

01:57.660 --> 01:59.036
CAN YOU GET HIM
TO STOP HUGGING ME?

01:59.080 --> 02:01.548
- UH, NOEL, NOEL, NOEL.
COULD--

02:01.600 --> 02:03.943
- LET'S ROLL AROUND,
LET'S ROLL AROUND.

02:03.980 --> 02:05.595
- [laughs] HE LOVES
ROLLING AROUND.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.017
- OH, YEAH. WELL, HEY,
THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

02:08.050 --> 02:09.870
YOU WANT TO ROLL AROUND, MAX?
- OH, GOD, HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.911
- HEY, ADAM.
- YEAH?

02:11.950 --> 02:14.817
- I BORROWED ANOTHER RECUMBENT
SO WE CAN GO BIKING LATER.

02:14.850 --> 02:17.239
- PHILLY! PHILLY!
WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT?

02:17.270 --> 02:18.191
- FROM JIM.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.095
- YOU KNOW, MAX IS NOT
FEELING SO GREAT.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.209
I THINK HE'S--
- OH, REALLY?

02:22.240 --> 02:24.128
- A LITTLE--
- IS IT DIARRHEA?

02:24.170 --> 02:26.172
- NOEL HAD DIARRHEA
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

02:26.210 --> 02:27.029
- HE DID.
- UHH!

02:27.070 --> 02:29.959
- OH, WELL,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

02:30.010 --> 02:31.238
- IT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW,
WE CAN DO IT ANOTHER TIME.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.315
- YEAH.
- TIME TO GO.

02:32.350 --> 02:33.760
- DEFINITELY.
- OKAY.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.451
- IT'S OKAY. GOT IT.
- RAIN CHECK ON THE RECUMBENT.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.218
- YEAH.
- OKAY? UH, MAX!

02:38.260 --> 02:41.115
- THANKS FOR THE NUTS.
- YOU'RE SO WELCOME.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.118
- NOEL, SAY GOOD-BYE.
- BYE!

02:44.160 --> 02:47.197
- BYE.
- BYE-BYE.

02:49.580 --> 02:52.617
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
BYE.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.789
UNBELIEVABLE.

02:54.820 --> 02:55.923
- WHAT'S WRONG?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.894
- GREG DAVIS QUIT.
SYDNEY'S COACH.

02:57.930 --> 03:02.139
HE'S GOT SOME NEW PROJECT
AT WORK OR SOME CRAP.

03:02.180 --> 03:03.442
- THAT HAPPENS.

03:03.490 --> 03:05.481
- NOT THREE DAYS BEFORE
THE SEASON STARTS,

03:05.530 --> 03:07.145
LEAVING ALL THE KIDS
IN THE LURCH.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.147
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

03:08.180 --> 03:10.626
THE WORK THING, BY THE WAY,
U'I'I'ERLY BOGUS.

03:10.670 --> 03:12.001
TOTALLY.

03:12.050 --> 03:13.278
- WHY?

03:13.330 --> 03:15.218
- GREG DAVIS
IS HYPER-COMPETITIVE.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.602
HE JUST WANTS TO COACH
THE STARS.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.870
HE DOESN'T WANT TO COACH
THE LOSER TEAM.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.194
- SYD'S ON THE LOSER TEAM?

03:20.230 --> 03:22.846
- YEAH.
ATHLETICALLY CHALLENGED.

03:22.890 --> 03:24.778
- SHE DOESN'T NEED THAT KIND
OF ENERGY AROUND HER ANYWAY.

03:24.820 --> 03:25.889
SHE'S BETTER OFF WITHOUT IT.
THIS IS A GOOD THING.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.263
- I AGREE. SHE NEEDS SOME KIND
OF ENERGY, JULIA.

03:28.310 --> 03:30.540
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A COACH.

03:30.580 --> 03:34.539
- WELL, HOW ABOUT
IF I DO IT?

03:34.590 --> 03:36.171
- YEAH.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.349
- WHAT?

03:38.390 --> 03:40.620
- OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS?
OKAY.

03:40.660 --> 03:42.969
- YEAH, WELL, WHY NOT?
- YEAH, YEAH.

03:43.010 --> 03:44.693
AND YOU DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA
BE AN ISSUE WITH THE--

03:44.740 --> 03:45.729
- WHAT?

03:45.770 --> 03:47.522
- YOU KNOW, WITH THE TEAM
IF THEY MAY NOT--

03:47.570 --> 03:49.424
- WIN?
- THAT'S IT, YEAH.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.847
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU HATE TO LOSE.

03:51.880 --> 03:55.600
- YEAH, I WOULD LOVE TO COACH
A TEAM OF REJECTS.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.914
- SURE YOU WOULD.
- OF LOSERS. YEAH.

03:56.960 --> 03:57.881
YOU KNOW WHY?
- NO.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.569
- BECAUSE IT PISSES ME OFF
THAT THE WORLD

03:59.610 --> 04:01.430
IS DIVIDED UP THAT WAY--
AT FIVE YEARS OLD?

04:01.480 --> 04:03.573
- YEAH.
- YEAH. NO.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.133
I'M NOT JUST SAYING,
"OKAY, I'LL DO IT."

04:05.170 --> 04:06.376
- NO. YOU'RE GETTING
RIGHT IN THERE.

04:06.410 --> 04:09.163
- I AM GONNA GIVE THESE KIDS
A GREAT COACHING EXPERIENCE

04:09.210 --> 04:10.370
THAT ISN'T ABOUT WINNING.

04:10.420 --> 04:11.444
- RIGHT. NO, NO.
- YES.

04:11.490 --> 04:13.276
- IT WOULDN'T BE, WITH YOU.
GOD, NO.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.038
IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT
HAVING A GOOD TIME. YEP.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.866
- HEY, SYD,

04:16.910 --> 04:19.697
GUESS WHO'S GONNA BE YOUR NEW
SOCCER COACH THIS SEASON.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.355
- WHO?

04:25.430 --> 04:27.910
- HI THERE, I AM LOOKING FOR
THE PRACTICALLY NEW LAPTOP

04:27.950 --> 04:29.838
AT THE LOW, LOW PRICE.

04:29.890 --> 04:31.050
OH, LOOK.

04:31.090 --> 04:33.024
[mutters indistinctly]

04:33.060 --> 04:36.097
- THAT WOULD BE THIS ONE.
- OKAY.

04:36.130 --> 04:38.269
- THAT'S, LIKE,
TEN YEARS OLD.

04:38.310 --> 04:41.780
- TEN YEARS?
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

04:41.830 --> 04:43.309
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S HUGE.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.306
NEWER COMPUTERS ARE SLIMMER.

04:45.350 --> 04:48.319
IT'S JUST--IT'S LIKE
A BAIT AND SWITCH.

04:48.350 --> 04:49.556
- WELL, THAT ONE'S
A YEAR OLD,

04:49.590 --> 04:53.492
BUT IF YOUR SON WANTS YOU
TO SEE SOMETHING SLIMMER, FINE.

04:53.530 --> 04:55.942
- I TOLD YOU,
JUST LOOK ON CRAIGSLIST.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.187
- HOW'S YOUR MOTHER GONNA
LOOK ON CRAIGSLIST

04:58.220 --> 05:00.529
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A COMPUTER?

05:00.570 --> 05:02.253
- EXCUSE ME,
CAN I SEE THESE?

05:02.300 --> 05:05.952
THE CUFF LINKS
WITH THE "Z" ON THEM?

05:09.100 --> 05:10.749
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

05:10.790 --> 05:11.927
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THESE
CAME FROM?

05:11.960 --> 05:14.758
- I DON'T REMEMBER, HONESTLY,
BUT THEY'RE VERY NICE.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.894
VERY ELEGANT.
YOU LIKE THEM?

05:16.930 --> 05:19.069
- HEY, MOM, I THINK
THAT ONE UP THERE

05:19.110 --> 05:21.863
HAS MAYBE A POSSIBILITY
FOR RUNNING PHOTOSHOP.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.891
- WOULD YOU MIND IF I TOOK
A PICTURE OF THESE?

05:23.940 --> 05:25.146
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

05:25.180 --> 05:29.241
- ISN'T THE COMPUTER MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THESE CUFF LINKS?

05:29.290 --> 05:30.450
- YEAH. IT'S JUST WEIRD.

05:30.500 --> 05:35.187
YOU KNOW, YOUR GRANDFATHER
HAS A PAIR JUST LIKE THESE.

05:35.230 --> 05:38.051
I MEAN, EXACTLY.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.679
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:44.720 --> 05:47.166
MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:47.200 --> 05:49.407
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:49.450 --> 05:51.543
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

05:51.590 --> 05:54.514
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

05:54.560 --> 05:56.346
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

05:56.390 --> 05:58.836
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:58.870 --> 06:01.452
FOREVER YOUNG

06:01.490 --> 06:04.141
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:04.190 --> 06:06.522
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:06.570 --> 06:08.709
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:08.740 --> 06:11.152
AND SEE THE LIGHT
SURROUNDING YOU

06:11.190 --> 06:13.750
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:13.780 --> 06:16.021
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:16.060 --> 06:18.096
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:18.130 --> 06:20.815
FOREVER YOUNG

06:20.860 --> 06:23.090
MAY YOU STAY

06:23.140 --> 06:25.722
FOREVER YOUNG

06:28.830 --> 06:31.867
- YEAH, WHO WE JUST SAW, BECAUSE
HIS THUMBS WERE LIKE THIS.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.664
LIKE, NO, LIKE, THEY WERE--
IT WAS ON ONE HAND.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.008
- REALLY? LIKE,
MINIATURE, LIKE?

06:36.050 --> 06:37.699
- YEAH, BUT I THINK
THAT'S WHAT USED TO HAPPEN.

06:37.740 --> 06:38.559
- OH, BOY.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.181
[both girls laugh]

06:40.220 --> 06:41.187
- HEY.
- HEY.

06:41.220 --> 06:42.801
- HI.

06:42.850 --> 06:43.839
WHAT, DO YOU WORK HERE
OR SOMETHING?

06:43.880 --> 06:46.155
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
SERVING THE RULING CLASS.

06:46.190 --> 06:47.509
AS USUAL.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.155
SO CAN I
GET YOU GUYS SOMETHING?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.121
- UM...

06:50.160 --> 06:53.982
- UH, HOW ABOUT TWO BEERS?
IS THAT COOL?

06:54.030 --> 06:56.237
- STEVE, DON'T, LIKE,
PUT HER ON THE SPOT.

06:56.270 --> 06:57.476
- UNBELIEVABLE, STEVE.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.579
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT
A LOT OF NERVE,

06:59.620 --> 07:01.656
YOU KIDS,

07:01.690 --> 07:03.829

OKAY, GUYS?

07:03.870 --> 07:05.588
- YOU'RE AMAZING. THANK YOU.
- I KNOW.

07:05.630 --> 07:07.279
- I'LL SEE YOU IN A SEC.
- BE CAREFUL.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.764
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO PAY FOR THAT?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.108
- NO, IT'S FINE, DUDE.
I GOT IT.

07:10.150 --> 07:10.935
- COOL.

07:10.980 --> 07:13.141
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

07:13.190 --> 07:14.282
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

07:14.330 --> 07:15.979
HE SAID WE SHOULD HAVE A PICNIC
ON THE GOLF COURSE,

07:16.020 --> 07:17.112
WHICH IS KIND OF CUTE.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.468
- WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A PICNIC
ON THE GOLF COURSE?

07:18.500 --> 07:19.671
THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD,
ISN'T IT?

07:19.710 --> 07:21.985
IT'S PROBABLY CODE FOR, LIKE--
- WHAT?

07:22.020 --> 07:22.941
- DOING IT.

07:22.990 --> 07:26.335
I'M SERIOUS. ITHINK
IT'S, LIKE, A THING.

07:26.370 --> 07:27.337
'CAUSE I SAW COUPLES
GOING OUT THERE

07:27.370 --> 07:29.258
WITH, LIKE, BLANKETS
AND BO'I'I'LES AND STUFF.

07:29.310 --> 07:31.198
- YOU KNOW WHAT? HE PROBABLY
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.093
IT'S PROBABLY, LIKE,

07:32.140 --> 07:33.926
AN URBAN LEGEND
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

07:33.970 --> 07:36.859
- YOU THINK?
- YEAH. YOU KNOW?

07:36.900 --> 07:38.788
- OH.

07:40.110 --> 07:41.589
YEAH, THAT'S A BLANKET.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.552
THAT'S A BLANKET
IN THAT BAG.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.386
GOOD LUCK.

07:45.430 --> 07:46.590
- HEY, DAD.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.074
- I'M ON MY WAY
TO RECHARGE MY BATTERIES.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.109
- DAD, DAD, DAD, WAIT.

07:49.150 --> 07:50.970
DO YOU STILL HAVE YOUR
CUFF LINKS THAT YOU HAD?

07:51.020 --> 07:54.911
THOSE BLACK ONES
WITH THE GOLD "Z" ON THEM?

07:54.950 --> 07:55.814
- WHY?

07:55.850 --> 07:58.364
- I WAS AT A PAWN SHOP
THE OTHER DAY,

07:58.400 --> 08:00.539
AND I SWEAR I SAW ONES

08:00.580 --> 08:02.571
THAT LOOKED EXACTLY
LIKE YOURS.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.781
- WELL, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN A PAWN SHOP?

08:04.820 --> 08:06.993
- I'M LOOKING FOR A LAPTOP
FOR MY PHOTOSHOP CLASS.

08:07.030 --> 08:09.442
BUT DO YOU STILL HAVE 'EM?
LOOK, I TOOK A PICTURE.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.994
THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME,
I SWEAR.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.009
- OH, THERE COULD BE, LIKE,
A THOUSAND OF THOSE.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.029
I DON'T KNOW.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.901
- I DON'T KNOW, DAD.
DO YOU STILL HAVE YOURS?

08:20.940 --> 08:23.329
I MEAN--
- AH, A PAWN SHOP.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.282
THAT FIGURES.

08:25.330 --> 08:29.118
DON'T TELL YOUR MOM,
BUT I, UH, I DID LOSE 'EM.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.879
I LOST 'EM AT THE GYM
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.718
PROMISE ME YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL HER. PROMISE?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.409
- OKAY.
- PROMISE WHAT?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.680
- I WON'T TELL YOU

08:40.720 --> 08:43.097
DAD'S BEEN DRINKING
OUT OF THE CARTON AGAIN.

08:43.140 --> 08:45.927
- BARBARIAN.

08:45.970 --> 08:49.178
- YOU RAT.

08:54.150 --> 08:55.833
[door closes]

08:56.840 --> 08:59.047
- A HOST IS SOMEONE
WHO HAS A FRIEND OVER.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.902
- THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

09:00.950 --> 09:03.601
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRST
RULE OF BEING A GOOD HOST IS?

09:03.640 --> 09:05.779
- SHARING.
- THAT'S RIGHT, SHARING.

09:05.820 --> 09:10.336
AND ALSO LETTING YOUR GUEST
CHOOSE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

09:10.370 --> 09:11.473
- OKAY.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.751
- SO THESE PEOPLE, THE
GENATASIOS, ARE COMING OVER,

09:13.790 --> 09:16.236
AND THEY HAVE A SON DAVID
RIGHT AROUND YOUR AGE.

09:16.270 --> 09:19.649
- UH-HUH.
- AND I WORK WITH DAVID'S DAD.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.066
SO, I MEAN,
IT WOULD BE NICE

09:21.110 --> 09:22.247
IF WE ALL DID OUR BEST
TO GET ALONG.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.486
- OKAY.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.409
- SO LET'S SAY YOU AND DAVID
ARE PLAYING WITH YOUR BUGS,

09:26.460 --> 09:27.973
AND DAVID DECIDES THAT,
YOU KNOW,

09:28.010 --> 09:29.830
HE DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY
WITH YOUR BUGS ANYMORE.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.314
HE WANTS TO PLAY BASKETBALL.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

09:31.360 --> 09:35.148
- PLAY BASKETBALL.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

09:35.190 --> 09:37.704
EVEN IF YOU WANT TO--
- STILL PLAY WITH BUGS.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.776
- EXACTLY. OKAY?

09:39.820 --> 09:41.469
- CAN WE STOP TALKING
ABOUT THIS NOW?

09:41.510 --> 09:43.603
- SURE.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.232
- YOU OWE ME
A STICKER FOR THIS.

09:46.270 --> 09:47.362
- YOU GOT IT.

09:47.410 --> 09:50.379
[jazzy music]

09:53.970 --> 09:55.995
- THIS IS AWESOME, BRIAN.

09:56.040 --> 10:00.909
HEY, TEAM, THIS SEASON,
A MIRACLE IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

10:00.940 --> 10:05.218
WE ARE GOING TO WIN
EVERY SINGLE GAME.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.182
- NO, WE'RE NOT.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.563
- WE ARE, BECAUSE
WE WILL DEFINE WINNING

10:08.600 --> 10:09.737
NOT BY WHAT'S
ON THE SCOREBOARD

10:09.780 --> 10:12.988
BUT BY EACH OF US GETTING BETTER
AT OUR SPECIAL SKILLS,

10:13.020 --> 10:15.841
BY PUTTING THEM TOGETHER
INTO A TEAM,

10:15.890 --> 10:18.745
AND BY HAVING FUN
WHILE WE'RE DOING IT.

10:18.790 --> 10:20.951
OKAY, LET'S GIVE BRIAN
A HAND.

10:20.990 --> 10:22.196
[applause]

10:22.240 --> 10:24.196
GOOD WORK.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.207
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

10:25.240 --> 10:26.616
THAT HAS A SPECIAL SKILL
THEY WANT TO SHARE?

10:26.660 --> 10:29.788
- I DO.
- OKAY.

10:37.980 --> 10:38.935
[applause]

10:38.980 --> 10:42.279
OKAY, MARCUS. THAT--

I DON'T WANT TO FORCE YOU

10:59.650 --> 11:02.096
INTO ANYTHING THAT
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.995
I LOVE YOU.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.588

FOR BEING WEIRD TONIGHT.

11:07.630 --> 11:09.860
- NO, IT'S--
IT'S COOL.

11:09.910 --> 11:13.801
WE CAN, UH, WE CAN TRY
FOR NEXT WEEK.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.661
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.668
YOU SAID--
WHAT YOU INDICATED--

11:19.710 --> 11:22.395
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT I LED YOU ON?

11:22.440 --> 11:23.429
- NO.

11:23.470 --> 11:24.846
NO, I'M SAYING--

11:24.890 --> 11:26.949
I'M SAYING
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

11:26.990 --> 11:30.619
SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY,
I'LL WAIT.

11:30.650 --> 11:32.641
- STEVE.

11:32.690 --> 11:35.898

LIKE,

11:35.930 --> 11:38.137
RIPEN LIKE
A PIECE OF FRUIT.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.034
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

11:40.070 --> 11:44.382
- I DON'T--I DON'T THINK THAT
THIS WHOLE THING IS WORKING.

11:44.420 --> 11:47.594
- WHAT WHOLE THING?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:47.630 --> 11:51.111
- LIKE US.

11:51.150 --> 11:53.493

EVEN SAY THAT?

11:53.540 --> 11:56.941
I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST UPSET,
OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT NOW, AND--

11:56.990 --> 12:00.812
- I'M UPSET.
I'M NOT JUST UPSET.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.989
- SO ONE MINUTE WE'RE GOING
FROM ALMOST HAVING SEX

12:03.030 --> 12:06.124
TO WHAT, A BREAKUP?

12:06.170 --> 12:07.091

12:57.010 --> 12:58.898
ARE YOU OKAY, BABE?
SHE'S NOT OKAY.

12:58.950 --> 12:59.735
- HEY, DID YOU TALK
TO HER?

12:59.770 --> 13:01.044
DID YOU FIND OUT
WHY THEY BROKE UP?

13:01.090 --> 13:02.773
- I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.
THEY JUST DID.

13:02.810 --> 13:03.981
THAT'S ALL I COULD
GET OUT OF HER.

13:04.020 --> 13:05.601
- WELL, WAS IT HIM?
WAS IT HER?

13:05.640 --> 13:06.743
I MEAN, WHO BROKE UP
WITH WHO HERE?

DO I EMBARRASS YOU
SOCIALLY?

THAT I DON'T HAVE.

13:51.650 --> 13:53.584
WHATEVER KIND IT TAKES
TO DO THIS.

13:53.620 --> 13:54.609
I CAN'T DO IT.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.343
THE PROFESSOR ALREADY
GAVE ME AN INCOMPLETE,

13:56.380 --> 13:57.961
AND THAT WAS JUST OUT OF
THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.106

YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SUCCEED.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.602
I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID
OF TRYING.

WITH FAILURE.

BUT IT WAS COLD, AND THERE
WAS, LIKE, A ROCK

15:00.450 --> 15:01.712
DIGGING INTO MY BACK.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.375
- OH, DUDE, YEAH.
THERE YOU GO, MAN.

15:03.410 --> 15:04.650
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.
IT'S A BAD VIBE.

15:04.690 --> 15:06.578
- AMBER, THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT WAS.

15:06.620 --> 15:07.894
LIKE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.101
I JUST--I WANT IT

BUT--SO YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM?

15:23.610 --> 15:24.702
- BASICALLY.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.264
IT WAS LIKE I WASN'T EVEN
WITH A PERSON ANYMORE.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.291
I WAS WITH
A STUPID CLICHE.

15:29.340 --> 15:31.786
- DUDE, I'M SO SORRY,
BUT BELIEVE ME,

15:31.820 --> 15:32.957
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW,

YOU DON'T WANT TO CASH IN
YOUR V CHIP

15:34.380 --> 15:38.134
WITH A CLICHE OR A JERK
OR A DOUCHE.

15:38.170 --> 15:42.345
SO I GUESS THAT
RULES OUT STEVE.

FOR SURE, MAN.

I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW
WHO BROUGHT THOSE IN.

THE OTHER DAY.

16:12.450 --> 16:13.542

A CASH FLOW THING.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.859
- OH, WELL, IF YOU CAME HERE
SCOUTING, FORGET ABOUT IT.

17:49.890 --> 17:51.096
- NO, I-I CAME TO SEE

17:51.130 --> 17:52.927
IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE
ONE OF MY PLAYERS.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.131
WE HAVE SO MANY
GOOD PLAYERS.

17:54.170 --> 17:54.966
IF YOU TAKE ONE,
IT WOULD,

17:55.000 --> 17:56.683
YOU KNOW,
MAKE THE GAME MORE FUN

17:56.730 --> 17:58.584
FOR EVERYONE.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.841
- NAMASTE.

18:20.890 --> 18:23.711
- IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN THE GHOST SPIDER,

18:23.750 --> 18:25.741
WE COULD LOOK AT
WEEVIL SNOUT BEETLES.

18:25.790 --> 18:27.678
WEEVIL SNOUT BEETLES ARE
PART OF THE LARGEST FAMILY

18:27.720 --> 18:28.891
IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.

18:28.930 --> 18:33.276
THERE ARE OVER 2,500 SPECIES
IN SOUTHERN AFRICA ALONE.

18:34.140 --> 18:34.890
[laughter]
- LIAR.

18:34.940 --> 18:37.204
- PREMATURE,
BUT I DID IT THEN.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.410
[overlapping chatter]

18:38.460 --> 18:39.791
I JUST WANT YOU GUYS
TO KNOW

18:39.840 --> 18:41.284
THE THINGS I'M ABOUT TO DO
WITH THIS BLEU CHEESE

18:41.320 --> 18:43.072
SHOULD PROBABLY BE
ILLEGAL.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.940
- [laughs]
- FIENDISH.

18:44.980 --> 18:47.084
- WHAT?
- LET IT GET ALL NICE AND MELTY.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.111
LET IT CARAMELIZE.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.980
- [whispers]
- HI, HON.

18:51.020 --> 18:52.009
- HEY, MAX, WHAT'S UP?

18:52.060 --> 18:53.948
- I ASKED IF HE WANTED
TO PLAY WITH OTHER BUGS.

18:53.990 --> 18:54.957
- YEAH?

18:54.990 --> 18:57.811
- UH, YOU GUYS,
I'M--I'M SORRY,

18:57.860 --> 19:00.579
BUT DAVID SAYS THAT
HE'S NOT FEELING SO WELL.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.201
- OH, YOU'RE--OH, NO.
HEAD OR TUMMY?

19:02.240 --> 19:03.821
'CAUSE WE HAVE--
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:03.860 --> 19:04.827
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST--

19:04.860 --> 19:06.725
IF HE'S CONTAGIOUS,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY

19:06.760 --> 19:07.613
ABOUT THE FIRST 24 HOURS,
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY--

19:07.660 --> 19:10.106
- BABE, WE JUST--
WE JUST GOT HERE.

19:10.140 --> 19:12.961
THE FOOD, I MEAN,
IT LOOKS DELICIOUS.

19:13.010 --> 19:15.524
- YEAH. OH, THAT'S OKAY.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.039
- WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
ANOTHER DAY.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.286
- YEP.
- OKAY. [clears throat]

19:18.320 --> 19:20.117
- NO WORRIES.

19:20.150 --> 19:21.185
- HEY, UM, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

19:21.220 --> 19:24.189
- SORRY, BUDDY. I'M SORRY.
[overlapping speech]

19:24.230 --> 19:25.606
- I HOPE IT WASN'T SOMETHING
THAT I COOKED.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.643
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW KIDS.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.329
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.
- BYE. THANKS.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.507
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- SEE YA.

19:31.540 --> 19:32.677
- THANK YOU.
- IT LOOKS DELICIOUS.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.789
- THANKS.

19:33.820 --> 19:35.026
- MAX, YOU WANT ME TO LOOK
AT SOME BUGS WITH YOU?

19:35.070 --> 19:37.516
- YOUR SHOELACE, BUDDY.

19:41.760 --> 19:42.556
- [spits]

19:42.590 --> 19:44.865
THAT KID WAS NOT SICK.
- I KNOW.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.313
- YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY WOULD JUST LEAVE LIKE THAT.

19:48.350 --> 19:49.556
YOU KNOW, WE HADN'T
EVEN BROUGHT OUT

19:49.600 --> 19:50.806
THE DAMN APPLE CRISP YET.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.046
YOU MADE APPLE CRISP.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.049
- HONEY, WE DID THE SAME THING
TO THE LESSINGS, REMEMBER?

19:55.090 --> 19:56.842
SAME THING.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.804
- WELL, LOOK, SO WHAT? NOW WE'RE
RELEGATED TO THE SHORT BUS?

19:59.850 --> 20:01.431
WE HAVE TO HANG OUT
WITH PEOPLE LIKE THE LESSINGS

20:01.470 --> 20:03.438
INSTEAD OF COOL PEOPLE
LIKE THE GENATASIOS?

20:03.470 --> 20:06.052
- WELL, MAYBE IT'S NOT
ABOUT US RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

20:06.100 --> 20:08.887
MAYBE IT'S ABOUT MAX.

20:08.930 --> 20:11.649
- WELL, CAN'T IT BE ABOUT US
JUST A LITTLE BIT?

20:14.760 --> 20:16.967
- [laughs]

20:17.000 --> 20:20.208
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:20.250 --> 20:22.480
- ROUND THREE?

20:22.530 --> 20:24.998
I'M GONNA NEED TO HYDRATE
OR SOMETHING BEFORE.

20:25.050 --> 20:26.187
- NO.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.039
- THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

20:27.080 --> 20:29.253
- NO, I WAS NOT
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

20:29.290 --> 20:33.044
I MEANT ABOUT YOUR SISTER
ASKING ABOUT JABBAR

20:33.090 --> 20:35.467
PLAYING ON THE SOCCER TEAM.

20:35.510 --> 20:36.499
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:36.540 --> 20:37.643
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

20:37.680 --> 20:40.331
- I HAVE TO PEE,
BUT WHEN I GET BACK,

20:40.370 --> 20:42.998
I WOULD LOVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

20:43.030 --> 20:44.258
SO...

20:44.310 --> 20:46.619
- OKAY.

20:50.690 --> 20:52.510
- CROSBY.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.346
- HEY.

20:54.390 --> 20:58.486
UH, YOU TIRED?

20:59.870 --> 21:03.419
OKAY, UH, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE STILL SLEEPING.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.325
THIS--THIS IS A DREAM.
- IT IS?

21:05.360 --> 21:07.942
- YEAH.
I'M NOT REALLY HERE.

21:07.990 --> 21:09.878
IT'S JUST A FUN DREAM.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.913
- OKAY.
OKAY, CROSBY.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.404
- ALL RIGHT.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.782
- SHOULD I GO BACK TO BED

21:16.820 --> 21:18.333
AND MAKE BELIEVE
I DIDN'T SEE YOU?

21:18.380 --> 21:20.166
- YES,
THAT'S A GOOD PLAN.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.612
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

21:35.320 --> 21:38.357
- OH. EXCUSE ME.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.664
- DON'T TAKE ALL THOSE.
THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE.

21:40.710 --> 21:44.009
- HAVE YOU TALKED
TO HADDIE?

21:44.060 --> 21:45.197
- IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:45.230 --> 21:47.744
- [sighs] LOOK,
SHE BROKE UP WITH ME.

21:47.780 --> 21:49.429
- WERE YOU PRESSURING HER,
PERHAPS?

21:49.480 --> 21:51.266
- NO, I WASN'T
PRESSURING HER.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.758
I JUST WANTED IT
TO BE SPECIAL.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.543
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

21:58.590 --> 22:01.343
MAYBE IT WASN'T THE RIGHT TIME
FOR HER OR SOMETHING.

22:01.380 --> 22:04.008
- WELL, SO SHE DID
TALK TO YOU.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.009
- YES, SHE TALKED TO ME.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.177
I TOLD HER
SHE SHOULD JUST DO

22:08.220 --> 22:11.667
WHATEVER SHE FELT WAS RIGHT
IN THE MOMENT, YOU KNOW?

22:11.700 --> 22:14.351
SO ARE YOU FEELING
MORE HEARTBROKEN

22:14.400 --> 22:16.425
OR ARE YOU FEELING
REJECT ED?

22:16.470 --> 22:18.938
- I GUESS
A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.

22:18.990 --> 22:21.197
THEY'RE, UH--TH EY'RE
PRETTY INSEPARABLE.

22:21.230 --> 22:23.027
- I WOULDN'T SAY
THEY'RE INSEPARABLE.

22:23.060 --> 22:24.857
I MEAN,
HEARTBROKEN, TO ME,

22:24.890 --> 22:27.336
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE MORE SAD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, YOU KNOW?

22:27.380 --> 22:30.133
LIKE, THAT YOU CAN'T BE
WITH A PERSON ANYMORE.

22:30.170 --> 22:33.412
BUT REJECT ED IS MORE, LIKE,
YOU'RE TAKING IT PERSONALLY

22:33.450 --> 22:35.827
AND YOU'RE MAD,
YOU KNOW?

22:35.870 --> 22:39.317
- WOW. WHERE DID, UH--WHERE DID
ALL THIS WISDOM COME FROM?

22:39.350 --> 22:41.625
- FROM FRESNO,
OF COURSE.

22:41.670 --> 22:42.830
- THE WISDOM CAPITAL
OF THE WORLD?

22:42.870 --> 22:43.973
- AH, YES,
YOU'VE HEARD OF IT.

22:44.010 --> 22:46.592
[both laugh]

22:46.640 --> 22:48.039
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

22:48.090 --> 22:49.944
WELL, MY MOM'S
KIND OF CRAZY.

22:49.980 --> 22:50.981
- MM-HMM.
- ISH.

22:51.020 --> 22:52.635
AND MY DAD REALLY WASN'T
AROUND VERY MUCH,

22:52.680 --> 22:56.844
SO I GUESS YOU JUST KIND OF
HAVE TO FIGURE STUFF OUT

22:56.890 --> 22:58.437
FOR YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE RAISED
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

22:58.480 --> 23:00.471
SO...
- TO SURVIVE, YEAH.

23:00.510 --> 23:01.784
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?
WHAT ARE THEY LIKE?

23:01.820 --> 23:07.031
- UM, THEY'RE PRETTY NORMAL,
AND, OH,

23:07.070 --> 23:08.378
THERE'S MY DAD, ACTUALLY,
AS WE SPEAK.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.409
- REALLY, THAT'S HIM?

23:09.450 --> 23:11.441
- UM, ACTUALLY, YEAH.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.482
THIS LAST YEAR, MY DAD GOT
DIAGNOSED WITH M.S.

23:14.530 --> 23:15.349
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

23:15.390 --> 23:16.209
- I'M SO SORRY.

23:16.250 --> 23:17.729
- I HAVEN'T REALLY TOLD
ANYONE THAT.

23:17.770 --> 23:21.251
BUT--
- WELL, I'LL KEEP IT A SECRET.

23:21.290 --> 23:23.042
- IT'S OKAY.

23:23.090 --> 23:25.979
DO YOU SEE HIM LIMPING?

23:26.020 --> 23:28.250
- I CAN'T TELL.
- NO?

23:28.300 --> 23:30.325
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I READ?
- HMM?

23:30.370 --> 23:32.474
- I READ THAT, UM,
PEOPLE WITH M.S.

23:32.510 --> 23:34.717
SOMETIMES LIKE TO GO
HORSEBACK RIDING, I GUESS,

23:34.750 --> 23:37.719
'CAUSE IT, LIKE, STIMULATES
THEIR MUSCLES OR SOMETHING.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.375
I DON'T KNOW.
- WELL, THAT'S COOL.

23:39.410 --> 23:41.583
I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE GOING
HORSEBACK RIDING ANYTIME SOON.

23:41.620 --> 23:44.134
BUT THAT'S--
- WELL, IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.

23:44.180 --> 23:46.136
- YEAH. NO, THANKS.

23:46.180 --> 23:51.049
SO CAN YOU MAYBE PASS A MESSAGE
ON TO HADDIE FOR ME?

23:51.080 --> 23:52.115
- AW, DUDE, NO WAY.

23:52.150 --> 23:54.186
NO. YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL
WITH YOUR OWN STUFF.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.632
- OKAY.

23:58.190 --> 23:59.771
- YOU'RE OKAY.

24:02.470 --> 24:04.438
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU SAY "EVERYTHING"?

24:04.470 --> 24:06.950
- WELL, I MEAN, I COULDN'T
SEE EVERY PIECE,

24:06.990 --> 24:08.400
BUT I SAW HIS GOLD WATCH
AND HIS COIN COLLECTION--

24:08.440 --> 24:09.429
- UH-HUH.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.708
- AND THAT BASEBALL THAT
REGGIE JACKSON SIGNED.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.445
- WAIT A MINUTE, THE REGGIE
JACKSON HOME RUN BALL FROM '77?

24:12.480 --> 24:14.471
- YES.
- HE PAWNED THAT?

24:14.520 --> 24:15.475
- DO YOU HAVE THOSE
IN AN 8 1/2? THEY'RE CUTE.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.509
- YEAH.

24:16.550 --> 24:18.108
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

24:18.140 --> 24:20.517
- WELL, LOOK, I KNOW HE WAS
HAVING SOME FINANCIAL TROUBLE.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.629
- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.173
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TRIP
I TOOK WITH HIM UP NORTH

24:23.220 --> 24:24.175
TO LOOK AT THAT
REAL ESTATE?

24:24.220 --> 24:25.175
- NO.

24:25.220 --> 24:26.482
- WELL, I DID,
AND ANYWAY,

24:26.530 --> 24:27.906
HE APPARENTLY WENT
COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN

24:27.940 --> 24:29.077
IN THIS REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENT.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.519
- WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THAT?

24:30.570 --> 24:32.151
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS PRIVATE.

24:32.190 --> 24:33.634
IT WAS--YOU KNOW, HE WAS
EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT,

24:33.670 --> 24:34.841
AND I, YOU KNOW--

24:34.880 --> 24:36.359
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T HE
AT LEAST TELL MOM?

24:36.400 --> 24:38.129
- WELL, HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO TELL MOM.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.082
I MADE HIM PROMISE.
I GUESS THAT MAYBE HE HASN'T.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.439
- OH, ADAM, HOW BAD
DO YOU THINK IT IS?

24:42.480 --> 24:45.779
- IT'S BAD ENOUGH FOR HIM
TO SELL THE REGGIE JACKSON BALL.

24:45.820 --> 24:47.708
WHICH I WANTED TO BE MINE,
EVENTUALLY.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.443
- OH, MY GOD. IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT YOUR HEIRLOOMS.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.447
- I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET THAT BACK.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.924
THAT'S A VALUABLE BASEBALL.

24:51.970 --> 24:53.938
- OKAY, BUT--IT'S--WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO IN THE MEANTIME?

24:53.970 --> 24:54.868
WHAT ABOUT MOM?

24:54.900 --> 24:56.458
- I THINK
YOU SHOULD TELL HER.

24:56.490 --> 24:58.310
- YOU SHOULD TELL HER.

24:58.350 --> 24:59.908
- WHY SHOULD I TELL HER?
- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE OLDEST.

24:59.940 --> 25:01.384
OOH, IS THAT A HIKING BOOT?

25:01.430 --> 25:02.829
- [sighs]

25:02.880 --> 25:04.450
- I MEAN, I DON'T HIKE YET,
BUT I MIGHT,

25:04.500 --> 25:05.455
NOW THAT I HAVE THE SHOES.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.467
THANK YOU.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.220
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.686

TO PRACTICE.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.335
- YOUR PLAYER FORGOT
HER LUCKY BARRETTE,

25:21.380 --> 25:22.824
AND WE HAD TO RUN HOME
TO GET IT, SO...

25:22.860 --> 25:24.748
- OH.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.485
- WHAT'S, UH, WHAT'S JABBAR
DOING OUT THERE?

25:26.520 --> 25:27.487
- OH, I DIDN'T TELL YOU?

25:27.520 --> 25:28.373

25:28.420 --> 25:33.005

TO LET HIM PLAY, SO--

25:33.040 --> 25:34.416
- REALLY?

25:34.460 --> 25:37.384
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE
SOME SELF-ESTEEM TO BUILD.

25:37.430 --> 25:38.567
- OH, I'LL JUST HOLD THIS
FOR YOU.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.215
- THANK YOU.

25:40.260 --> 25:41.352
[whistle tweets]

25:41.400 --> 25:46.394
- WAVE TOHIHE FREAK.

25:46.510 --> 25:47.670
- WHO ARE YOU
CALLING A FREAK?

25:47.710 --> 25:49.359
YOU'RE THE FREAK.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.367
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:50.410 --> 25:52.549
I'VE NEVER HAD
A MANIACAL SMILE LIKE THAT.

25:52.580 --> 25:55.879
- NO, BUT YOU ONLY TRIED
TO BRAINWASH OUR SON.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.615
- BRAINWASH?
- YES, BRAINWASH.

25:58.660 --> 26:01.345
- I MERELY MADE
A SUGGESTION, ALL RIGHT?

26:01.380 --> 26:03.348

36:01.290 --> 36:05.420
TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS,
AND SO I ENDED UP, YOU KNOW,

36:05.470 --> 36:09.429
SELLING SOME
OF MY PERSONAL ITEMS.

36:09.470 --> 36:14.646
AND, UH, WE'VE GOT SOME
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,

36:14.750 --> 36:17.162
SOME ISSUES THERE.

36:17.200 --> 36:20.306
- PERFECT.

36:20.350 --> 36:23.934
MORE LIES, HUH?

36:23.970 --> 36:26.074
- [sighs]
LOOK, CAMILLE.

36:26.110 --> 36:29.591
- MOM, WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU,
YOU KNOW, ANY WAY WE CAN.

36:29.630 --> 36:32.383
- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

36:32.430 --> 36:36.355
_ THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT MONEY,
IS IT, ZEEK?

36:42.820 --> 36:46.745
WELL, I-I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW,

36:46.790 --> 36:49.338
BUT, UM...

36:49.370 --> 36:50.849
YOU'RE ALL SO SWEET.

36:50.890 --> 36:52.096
- MOM.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.334
- LOOK, WE CAN, UH--

36:53.380 --> 36:55.200
- MOM.
- I GOT IT.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.446
- UM...

36:56.490 --> 36:59.891
- ADAM HAS A POINT...

37:10.190 --> 37:12.420
- DAD.

37:15.260 --> 37:18.127
DAD?

37:18.160 --> 37:19.809
[door slams]

37:25.860 --> 37:27.088
[knocks]

37:27.140 --> 37:29.961
- MOM, CAN I COME IN?

37:32.140 --> 37:35.314
MOM, LET ME TALK TO YOU.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.041
[engine starts]

37:48.300 --> 37:51.258
- AS SOON AS
THE STORM IS OVER

37:53.370 --> 37:56.749
OOH

37:56.790 --> 38:00.237
OOH

38:00.270 --> 38:04.821
AS SOON AS THE STORM
IS OVER

38:13.730 --> 38:15.493
- GOOD NIGHT, PELE.
- NIGHT.

38:15.530 --> 38:18.044
- GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.184
- ARE YOU SLEEPING OVER?

38:20.220 --> 38:22.734
- UH, NOT TONIGHT.

38:22.780 --> 38:23.678
- AW.

38:38.380 --> 38:40.928
- IT'S, UH--IT'S NOT
FOOLING AROUND.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.517
- HMM?

38:42.560 --> 38:45.006
- WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING,
THAT'S--

38:45.040 --> 38:46.314
IT'S NOT FOOLING AROUND.

38:46.350 --> 38:48.693
I'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH
ON THAT TOPIC,

38:48.740 --> 38:53.905
AND I WANT TO BE WITH YOU,
JASMINE.

38:55.980 --> 38:59.768
- CROSBY,
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT

38:59.820 --> 39:02.220
WITH YOUR PARENTS
AND EVERYTHING TONIGHT.

39:02.270 --> 39:06.855
LET'S JUST
GIVE IT SOME TIME.

39:06.890 --> 39:08.710
LET'S SEE.

39:14.660 --> 39:15.513
CROSBY?

39:15.560 --> 39:17.448
[clears throat]

39:17.490 --> 39:21.597
YOU WANT TO HAVE
A SLEEPOVER?

39:21.630 --> 39:24.554
- YEAH. I LIKE SLEEPOVERS.
- YOU DO?

39:24.600 --> 39:25.692
- YEAH.
- YEAH, SO DO I.

39:25.740 --> 39:26.900
- THEY'RE LIKE
MY FAVORITE.

39:26.950 --> 39:29.259
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

39:29.290 --> 39:32.009
I DIDN'T BRING
ANY JAMMIES, THOUGH.

39:32.050 --> 39:33.085
- YOU DON'T NEED ANY.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.395
[knock on door]

39:35.440 --> 39:36.361
- HEY.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.504
MOM, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THIS COMPUTER.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.612
I CANNOT TELL YOU
HOW IT'S HELPING ME.

39:41.650 --> 39:43.618
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

39:43.650 --> 39:45.789
- MOM, PLEASE,
DON'T WORRY.

39:45.830 --> 39:47.684
IT'S FINE.

39:47.730 --> 39:49.277
- WE'VE HAD
MONEY PROBLEMS BEFORE,

39:49.310 --> 39:50.208
AND WE'LL HAVE THEM AGAIN.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.411
WHAT I CARE ABOUT
IS THAT YOUR FATHER

39:51.450 --> 39:54.795
DOESN'T RESPECT ME ENOUGH
TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

39:54.840 --> 39:57.832
- OH, MOM, IT'S--
YOU KNOW HOW HE IS.

39:57.870 --> 40:01.112
I'M SURE HE JUST DOESN'T
WANT TO WORRY YOU, YOU KNOW?

40:01.150 --> 40:02.708
- I KNOW.

40:02.740 --> 40:04.560
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LYING
GOING ON FOR A LOT OF YEARS,

40:04.600 --> 40:07.046
AND NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY.

40:07.090 --> 40:09.638
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:12.300 --> 40:16.714
- THERE WAS A WOMAN
UP NORTH.

40:16.750 --> 40:18.160
- OH, MOM.

40:18.200 --> 40:21.545
- YEAH.

40:21.590 --> 40:25.583
I COVERED FOR HIM.

40:25.630 --> 40:28.622
I'VE BEEN COVERING FOR HIM
FOR YEARS,

40:28.660 --> 40:31.242
TELLING MYSELF THAT I WAS
DOING IT FOR YOU KIDS

40:31.290 --> 40:35.112
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONLY PARTLY TRUE.

40:35.150 --> 40:37.596
SO I--
I DON'T KNOW.

40:37.640 --> 40:41.019
I JUST COULDN'T,

40:41.050 --> 40:45.578
FOR SOME REASON,
CONFRONT HIM ABOUT IT.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.953
SO I LET IT GO.

40:49.550 --> 40:53.509
I JUST LET IT GO.

40:53.550 --> 40:56.348
AND NOW YOU KNOW.

40:56.380 --> 40:58.757
- MOM.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.689
- DON'T TELL THE OTHERS
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

41:01.730 --> 41:04.699
- OH.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.766
OKAY.

41:10.530 --> 41:11.565
- SO HOW'S IT GOING?

41:11.600 --> 41:13.465
- NO, NO, DON'T.
IT'S NOTHING.

41:13.500 --> 41:16.674
I'M NOT DONE.
IT'S--I'M JUST--FOR CLASS.

41:18.750 --> 41:20.741
- WOW.

41:28.310 --> 41:31.586
SEE? I TOLD YOU
YOU COULD DO IT.

41:31.620 --> 41:35.135
- DON'T EVER FORGET

41:35.180 --> 41:39.549
THAT YOU'RE NEVER ALONE

41:39.600 --> 41:43.627
I WANT YOU TO

41:43.670 --> 41:47.140
LIVE FOREVER

41:47.190 --> 41:50.705
UNDERNEATH

41:50.740 --> 41:53.573
THE SKY SO BLUE

41:53.610 --> 41:55.532
OH, YEAH

41:55.580 --> 41:57.787
I WANT YOU

41:57.820 --> 42:02.883
TO LIVE FOREVER

42:02.930 --> 42:05.683
UNDERNEATH, UNDERNEATH

42:05.730 --> 42:08.107
YEAH, A SKY SO BLUE

42:08.140 --> 42:10.552
[knocking on door]

42:10.590 --> 42:14.481
OH, I WANT YOU TO

42:14.530 --> 42:15.861
- HEY, SONNY.

42:15.910 --> 42:17.878
- HEY.

42:17.910 --> 42:21.869
- UNDERNEATH
THE SKY SO BLUE

42:21.910 --> 42:24.253
- WELL, ARE YOU GONNA
LET ME IN OR WHAT?

42:26.640 --> 42:29.268
- COME ON IN.
- ALL RIGHT.
