WEBVTT

00:46.797 --> 00:49.716
l don't care if it's windy or rainy,

00:50.384 --> 00:54.220
there's no reason for a shake roof to fail
if it's laid right.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.222
Except that one.

00:56.682 --> 01:00.143
No flashing around the chimney.
That's gonna cost them.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.441
Go around!

01:13.490 --> 01:17.410
Now, l'm gonna push it up
to 25 miles an hour.

01:17.494 --> 01:22.081
That's what we're allowed to do here.
You've got to really pay attention.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.763
Fifteen minutes of news
and nothing about the Holy Father.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.639
He's still dead, Ma.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.058
-The shower cap hold up?
-Yes.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.437
Piece ofjunk.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.524
lf you want, l'll have Gerry come over
and fix your shower.

01:48.609 --> 01:52.820
lt was fixed, but l think Ronnie the super
sneaks in and breaks it.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.323
For all l know
he's going through my things right now.

01:55.407 --> 01:58.075
You don't like getting
a little bit of attention?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.828
Anita, this man does not look
the way you want him to.

02:00.913 --> 02:04.791
l'd offer you a room,
but since Mom moved in, l don't have it.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.336
l want to move to Manhattan.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.422
Really? lt's so far away.

02:11.840 --> 02:16.719
lt is far, and l commute almost two hours
total every day, five days a week.

02:17.221 --> 02:22.058
-That's an extra week of work each month.
-My goodness. l never thought of that.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.644
Pegs, the rents there, they're outrageous.

02:24.728 --> 02:28.147
l know, but l'm already spending a fortune
between subway fare,

02:28.232 --> 02:29.857
cab fare on late nights,

02:29.942 --> 02:34.695
pantyhose... lf l can't find a newspaper,
the cane on the seats destroys them.

02:35.239 --> 02:38.032
And it'll be easy with that savings
and a roommate.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.160
Jeez Louise,
you've really been thinking about this.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.621
Ma, it's not good for it!

02:46.542 --> 02:50.086
Why don't you move in here
and we send her to Manhattan?

02:52.130 --> 02:54.465
You gonna be one of those girls?

02:56.260 --> 02:58.219
l am one of those girls.

02:59.847 --> 03:04.100
Well, Ho-Ho, l observed your wishes
for secrecy, but now is the time.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.687
Gentlemen.

03:09.189 --> 03:14.569
lmagine the perfect mixture of athletics,
spectacle and speed.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.780
Jai alai.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.576
Jai alai is like handball,
only you fling the ball

03:21.660 --> 03:24.370
and catch the ball with this basket thing.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.540
lt's more complicated than that.
And dangerous.

03:28.584 --> 03:32.128
l'll leave the loose-leaf, but it shows
the way jai alai attendance is growing.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.089
ln seven years, it'll eclipse baseball.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.884
Go ahead, you can laugh,

03:37.968 --> 03:41.345
but it's got the same fingerprint as baseball,
only better.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.931
A special stadium called a fronton,

03:44.057 --> 03:49.228
and you can sit real close, which is a thrill
because the ball goes 1 75 miles an hour.

03:49.730 --> 03:54.066
And it's got Patxi.
He's Babe Ruth, only handsome.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.155
This is Patxi.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.243
l was looking for boxers,
but l bought his contract instead.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.580
-He's the greatest player in the world.
-Mel Ferrer.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.750
l'm terrified of him catching balls
in the face.

04:13.003 --> 04:16.964
So, let's say there's enough money.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.842
How would you chop it up?

04:20.302 --> 04:22.887
Well, most of it's going
to end up in television.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.847
Perfect, because l want a TV show.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.683
-A sports show?
-Did you see Patxi?

04:28.352 --> 04:33.022
You don't see him flying around the world,
solving crimes and banging broads?

04:33.690 --> 04:36.943
Harry has excellent relationships
with the networks.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.029
-Well, it'll probably have to be ABC.
-No, no.

04:40.781 --> 04:45.534
l want to be on all the networks, like when
the President addresses the nation.

04:45.786 --> 04:51.082
Tuesday night, 8:30 to 9:00,
all three networks, the same show.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.212
-No one's ever done it.
-Because...

04:59.299 --> 05:00.716
That's true.

05:02.052 --> 05:07.974
How about a star-studded
big musical special with a jai alai match.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.143
-Desi Arnaz.
-What else you got?

05:11.937 --> 05:14.689
-Well, there's print.
-Women's magazines.

05:14.773 --> 05:18.234
A glamorous night in Miami
with a free admission.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.988
-Tuesday night is ladies' night.
-And, of course, newspapers are key,

05:22.072 --> 05:24.907
but you can't limit yourself
to less than 1 0 markets.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.742
This is impressive.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.497
-Don't get up.
-Horace, this is Don Draper.

05:31.581 --> 05:35.418
-l told you he'd be stopping by.
-Well, don't let me interrupt.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.670
So far, for the jai alai campaign,

05:37.754 --> 05:40.047
Sterling Cooper will produce
an adventure program

05:40.132 --> 05:43.384
starring your handsome fellow,
a musical spectacular...

05:43.468 --> 05:46.637
On all three networks,
and it has to be in color.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.098
CBS doesn't have color.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.395
Fine. l'd like to get
the ladies' magazines in color,

05:54.479 --> 05:57.356
and maybe a color page
in the Sunday paper.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.777
-What about radio?
-You'll have to take radio the way it is.

06:03.613 --> 06:08.534
l don't think it's worth anyone's time
unless you're willing to commit to at least

06:09.036 --> 06:14.290
-$1 million, to start.
-Sure, but that's a third of my ad budget.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.170
Well, as they used to say
at the freshmen mixer,

06:19.296 --> 06:23.632
-"When you get a yes, you go home."
-Only, Humps, you never got one.

06:27.345 --> 06:31.807
Listen, Draper, l'd love to buy you dinner,
run some slogans by you.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.643
Actually, Ho-Ho, we buy you dinner.

06:42.194 --> 06:43.652
That was fun.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.572
l'm going to have to buy Campbell
a case of something.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.823
Patxi.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.786
During the Depression, l saw somebody

06:51.870 --> 06:54.288
throw a loaf of bread
off the back of a truck.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.248
lt was more dignified.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.085
Are you going to have trouble
sleeping tonight?

06:59.169 --> 07:02.213
l've seen clients
far more defenseless than he.

07:02.297 --> 07:06.383
Well, as the Bible says,
"Enjoy your fatted calf."

07:06.927 --> 07:10.346
Campbell, did you tell him
who this idiot's father is?

07:10.597 --> 07:13.432
He said he's a shipping magnate,
not a client.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.602
Horace Sr. is connected to Bert Cooper
in a million ways,

07:16.686 --> 07:19.480
and l don't know if he would like
what just happened in there.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.774
You want to run it by his daddy?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.944
He's my age.
So he was born with a lot of money.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.656
He has a dream,
and it's ourjob to make it come true.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.035
Well, there you have it.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.666
Nicely done, my boy.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.422
Elizabeth. Get off your feet.
lt's bad for the baby.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.717
-As soon as l finish the dishes.
-Sit with me.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.389
Cleaning up for the maid.
You're just like your mother.

08:01.606 --> 08:05.526
l don't like watching you commit suicide.
Neither do your kids.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.656
What do you want, Daddy?

08:13.493 --> 08:16.871
lt's all laid out in here,

08:17.956 --> 08:21.208
my arrangements.
Just follow the directions.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.169
l don't want to talk about this.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.046
We talk about it now and then
we don't talk about it. That's the idea.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.508
-Fine.
-Jesus. Smoke your cigarette.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.224
Funerals are a dishonest business.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.144
People don't want to think about it.
That's how they get you.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.938
Remember what happened
with your mother?

08:43.440 --> 08:47.985
The will's translucent or transparent
or something according to the lawyers.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.695
You run the show.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.782
-You took me in.
-Anything else?

08:55.952 --> 08:58.621
l want you to have your mother's coats.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.708
l gave Judy the Hudson seal,
but l want you to have the chinchilla

09:02.792 --> 09:04.835
and obviously the mink.

09:06.129 --> 09:09.965
They're in the cedar closet.
They key's in Gloria's end table.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.468
Okay, Daddy.

09:14.763 --> 09:19.058
You don't want to hear about it,
Scarlett O'Hara?

09:19.267 --> 09:20.935
l have the folder.

09:24.022 --> 09:27.233
You've always been sensitive.
That's my fault for shielding you

09:27.317 --> 09:32.321
from all the dangers out there.
That's probably why you married this joker.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.576
lf you'd even known what was possible...

09:40.705 --> 09:45.042
But that's that. l wrote it down.
We never have to talk about it again.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.754
l don't understand
why you like talking about this

09:48.838 --> 09:51.840
when you can see so clearly
that it upsets me.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.344
You're being selfish and morbid.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.847
l'm your little girl.

09:59.683 --> 10:04.019
And l know it must be horrible
to be looking at whatever you're looking at,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.522
but can't you keep it to yourself?

10:11.319 --> 10:14.363
-What kind of mood is he in?
-l'm never right.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.783
-Anybody been outside? Do l need a coat?
-l'd take it.

10:17.867 --> 10:22.371
Don, George Caan dropped out of Patio
to direct a picture in LA.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.748
l look forward to his average work.
Replace him.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.959
There's no time and there's no talent.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.420
What were you gonna do
if you had to fire him?

10:29.504 --> 10:31.880
-Have Sal do it.
-Are you serious?

10:32.382 --> 10:35.259
-Sal, do you want to do it?
-Of course l do.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.430
lt sounds good,
but it makes me very nervous.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.974
lt's lifted straight from Bye Bye Birdie.
lt's a single shot.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.227
Sal did the storyboards. l could go on,
but l don't think l should have to.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.396
-Allison?
-Keens chophouse.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.023
Thank you, Don.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.068
Tag. You're it.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.568
Hey. You don't want
to cut towards yourself.

11:38.782 --> 11:43.285
There we go. Get down.
l've got some great things in here.

11:45.121 --> 11:49.208
This is an exact imitation
of the Gettysburg Address.

11:49.834 --> 11:53.295
-You know about Honest Abe?
-He learned to read by candlelight.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.838
That's right.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.008
Well, l'll be.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.303
Don, look at this.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.643
Victory medal, France.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.855
l should have another for beating the clap.

12:16.611 --> 12:17.986
Here we are.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.448
Wow!

12:22.450 --> 12:25.786
That spike, it's Prussian.

12:27.038 --> 12:30.416
Germany's greatest soldiers.
You had to respect that.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.752
That's where l got him.

12:34.295 --> 12:38.590
-You see that? Dried blood.
-You shot him?

12:39.426 --> 12:43.887
l think so. l shot lots of them.
They were trying to kill us.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.765
-War is bad.
-Maybe,

12:47.308 --> 12:49.685
but it makes a man out of you.

12:49.769 --> 12:56.483
Living off the land, battling the elements,
standing alongside your brothers.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.945
-Ask your pop.
-Gene.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.865
-What?
-Gene, don't.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.034
-Come on.
-Bobby, give it back.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.871
Let him have it! That's why l got it!

13:08.955 --> 13:12.166
-Can't l have it?
-There was a person in that helmet.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.711
-An enemy.
-Bobby, it's a dead man's hat. Take it off.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.589
Keep it on. lt's yours.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.449
There was this girl...

13:52.749 --> 13:55.375
You like? lt was on sale at A&S.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.546
Looks like a lot more than 20% off.

14:07.931 --> 14:13.352
Kitty.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.272
l'm working.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.951
-Something's wrong, isn't it?
-No.

14:30.119 --> 14:34.122
No, no, no, don't say that. Don't say that.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.505
-l'm not myself.
-What does that mean?

14:45.885 --> 14:49.137
Why are men so embarrassed
to share their emotions?

14:56.854 --> 14:59.481
Please. Sal...

15:01.901 --> 15:05.779
The past few months... Something's wrong.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.907
-Well, that's not true.
-lt is true.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.662
You know, l don't need that much, but...

15:14.539 --> 15:16.206
l do need tending.

15:21.337 --> 15:25.299
-l'm so sorry.
-Well, what can l do?

15:26.634 --> 15:28.510
You won't even tell me.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.055
Make some excuse.

15:34.309 --> 15:39.313
For the last six months, maybe a year, even,
l've watched my job disappear.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.234
Nobody wants illustrations anymore.
lt's all about photography.

15:45.236 --> 15:48.030
And yes, l've been nervous.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.283
And now l have this opportunity

15:51.367 --> 15:54.453
to do something
that really does have a future.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.957
So it's been building to this,
and tomorrow you will triumph

15:59.042 --> 16:01.460
and come home a conquering hero.

16:03.379 --> 16:08.091
-What's wrong with you?
-Well, l do have one horrible flaw.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.594
l love you.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.350
l don't want to fail.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.688
Just... With a single mistake,
the entire shot is ruined.

16:22.315 --> 16:26.818
So what? You've seen the movies.
Take two. Take three. Do it again. Action.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.905
lt's one shot, the whole thing.

16:30.782 --> 16:34.993
-lt's the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.
-l'm trying to remember.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.496
She starts singing
against a blue background,

16:37.580 --> 16:39.122
and her voice is very girlish.

16:39.207 --> 16:44.086
-Yes. Yes, l remember that.
-And she's offering us this can of Patio.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.505
And she's on a treadmill,
but you can't see it.

16:46.589 --> 16:50.425
-She's walking back and forth?
-No, no. She walks towards you.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.471
The wind is blowing in her hair,

16:54.931 --> 16:58.016
and she sings about
how Patio is low in calories.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.645
And then she extends her hand out
and she waves goodbye.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.689
Then we move back, too,

17:03.773 --> 17:06.858
but she stops,
and she takes her dress in her hands

17:06.943 --> 17:11.738
and she runs forward as fast as she can.
But then she turns her back

17:14.784 --> 17:17.536
and looks seductively over her shoulder.

17:17.620 --> 17:22.040
The treadmill pulls her back again
and she comes towards you one last time,

17:22.125 --> 17:26.294
dancing right up to the camera.
She sort of pushes her shoulders together

17:26.379 --> 17:30.966
and leans over with the can
and she smiles. "Hello, Patio."

17:35.638 --> 17:37.431
Something like that.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.434
Sound good?

17:41.936 --> 17:43.812
You're gonna do great.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.659
-You really think so?
-Yes.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.796
Don, l'd like you to meet Horace Cook.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.675
-We've met. Lincoln Center.
-Of course.

18:14.010 --> 18:17.429
Have a seat.
Lane has brought it to my attention

18:17.513 --> 18:20.265
that Mr. Cook's son
has approached us for work.

18:20.349 --> 18:24.686
Actually, it was Don who thought it best,
out of deference, to include you.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.982
We're not psychiatrists.
There is no confidentiality.

18:29.484 --> 18:34.738
That's not strictly true, but you are family
and, well, it appears to be a lot of money.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.534
Bert seemed alarmed.
What exactly happened in this meeting?

18:41.204 --> 18:45.165
-Well, you know, your son has a dream.
-Yes, jai alai.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.627
When he first mentioned it
l assumed he was gambling,

18:48.711 --> 18:51.630
but he seems convinced
of its financial potential.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.298
And there's no reason to doubt that.

18:53.382 --> 18:58.595
Are you drunk? lt's like Polish handball.
You can't even play it if you're left-handed.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.388
There's no wall on that side.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.225
Well, then, that's done with.
We needn't be involved.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.853
Bert, you know that's not the way
the marketplace works.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.481
A man comes through your door,

19:09.565 --> 19:12.859
he knows what he wants,
he's got the money to back it up,

19:12.944 --> 19:16.071
-you do your best.
-Perhaps l'm unclear

19:16.572 --> 19:19.491
because l'm childless, but they're not.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.746
Well, should you be lucky enough
to strike gold,

19:24.997 --> 19:29.501
remember that your children weren't there
when you were swinging the pick.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.171
l've seen his plan. lt's gibberish.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.926
But if you refuse him,
he'll only find someone else.

19:40.388 --> 19:44.140
My son lives in a cloud of success,

19:44.976 --> 19:46.852
but it's my success.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.690
Perhaps when that evaporates
and his face is pressed

19:51.774 --> 19:55.944
against the reality of the sidewalk,
he'll be of value to someone.

20:00.992 --> 20:04.119
"Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten."

20:05.288 --> 20:07.289
That's how l was raised.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.625
So you want us to proceed?

20:13.796 --> 20:17.465
When we put that money aside for him,
he was a little boy.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.887
We didn't know
what kind of person we were making.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.642
Don't be so hard on yourself.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.688
Easy for you to say.
He doesn't have your name.

20:31.814 --> 20:34.399
You'll stay for lunch. No discussion.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.319
A pleasure to see you again.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.154
Pleasure.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.951
-l'll sign him tonight.
-Very good.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.540
These are ideas.

20:50.625 --> 20:54.419
You can skip some if you want to,
but do not go out of order.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.179
Hello, this is Margaret.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.390
Hello, my name is Elaine and l'm 22,

21:07.475 --> 21:11.186
and l have a good job
and l'm interested in a roommate, too.

21:11.437 --> 21:15.231
Well, it's nice to speak with you, Elaine.
Where do you work?

21:15.691 --> 21:17.776
Well, l live in Teaneck, New Jersey,

21:17.860 --> 21:20.904
so l want to be in this city
to be near my job.

21:20.988 --> 21:26.117
-I work in a tannery on the West Side.
-Really? They make leather?

21:27.203 --> 21:28.787
I'm a secretary,

21:29.038 --> 21:32.457
but l am around animal skins and carcasses
most of the day,

21:32.541 --> 21:36.169
so l don't keep pets.
The smell makes them go crazy.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.592
l don't know if the West Side
is what l had in mind.

21:42.677 --> 21:45.387
l need someplace near a major hospital.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.390
My face is very badly burned

21:48.891 --> 21:52.560
and l need frequent prescriptions
for unguents and salves.

21:56.399 --> 21:59.985
-lt would have to be two bedrooms.
-Two bedrooms is good.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.364
Now, about the bathroom,

22:05.700 --> 22:08.118
I'm going to need some help there.

22:10.329 --> 22:14.082
Who is this?
You know something? You're a jerk.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.430
-Why do you do that?
-l've got a salt tooth.

22:29.807 --> 22:33.476
-lt's right here in the back of my mouth.
-Grandpa.

22:34.478 --> 22:38.606
lt's getting harder to fool you.
l got two spoons.

22:39.442 --> 22:42.652
Mommy doesn't let us
have ice cream before dinner.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.489
ls she afraid you're going to be fat
like she was?

22:47.742 --> 22:50.702
Your grandma Ruth used to
drive her to town to run errands

22:50.786 --> 22:54.122
and make her walk herself home.
That put a stop to it.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.459
-You remember Grandma Ruth?
-She gave me a ukulele.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.419
-Did you learn it?
-No.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.838
You can, you know. You're smart.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.676
You remind me of your grandma
more than your mother.

23:07.053 --> 23:13.308
You know, she did drafting
in the 20s for this engineer.

23:14.852 --> 23:18.229
-A little bald man. He wasn't a threat.
-That's good.

23:23.402 --> 23:27.655
You can really do something.
Don't let your mother tell you otherwise.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.622
You know, she won't let me eat this either,
and l don't want to be the only one,

23:35.706 --> 23:38.958
so l'll tell you what.
l'm gonna keep a lookout.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.881
Okay. Go ahead. The coast is clear.

23:46.592 --> 23:50.470
-She's coming! Quick, hide it!
-l knew you were gonna do that.

23:52.598 --> 23:56.935
This tastes like chocolate,
but it smells like oranges. You smell that?

24:03.692 --> 24:07.195
A year from now there'll be nothing
but rum and Mexican beer in this place.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.406
-You ever have Mexican beer, Humps?
-l don't drink a lot of beer.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.660
You have to when you're there.
Amoeba, dysentery.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.956
Patxi caught a bug, lost eight pounds.
That's a lot on his frame.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.792
Ho-Ho was saying a photo of Jack Kennedy
enjoying jai alai

24:20.876 --> 24:23.336
would be a tremendous endorsement.

24:23.796 --> 24:24.963
My father hates Kennedy,

24:25.047 --> 24:27.590
'cause he knew Old Joe
when they were criminals together.

24:27.675 --> 24:31.386
Plus, Dad's against integration.
He called Patxi a wetback.

24:32.721 --> 24:36.766
Jack Kennedy certainly ended up
with a betterjob than his father.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.895
l know this idea sounds crazy,
but read your history.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.314
l've got a 50% chance, at least.

24:44.900 --> 24:48.069
My father's dead,
but l know he'd be interested.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.030
This is his kind of investment.

24:52.158 --> 24:55.326
l think about the way
my father made his fortune,

24:55.911 --> 24:59.080
renting ships for troop transport
during the war.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.458
He didn't care about the Germans.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.837
And then l think,
l could really do something.

25:07.298 --> 25:11.301
l might not be president, but l could...
l could build something.

25:11.594 --> 25:14.345
And people will like it,
and l'm going to be the father of this sport,

25:14.430 --> 25:18.683
and people are gonna be dying
to do business with me, even my father.

25:21.437 --> 25:24.689
l have this image in my mind.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.610
lt's his 75th birthday,

25:29.653 --> 25:32.697
and l give him a team.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.458
l want to give you a piece of advice.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.712
l've been doing this a while,
and l applaud your enthusiasm,

25:48.797 --> 25:52.258
but l think you should take this decision
a little more seriously.

25:52.343 --> 25:55.637
-What are you saying, Don?
-Let him... Let him talk.

25:56.513 --> 26:00.850
You have a great fortune,
and that's not just money. That's the future.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.939
And we will take all of your money,
l promise you,

26:07.149 --> 26:10.860
but l think you should reevaluate
this particular obsession.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.988
You can do better.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.504
That's a sales technique, isn't it?

26:30.172 --> 26:33.466
You zig away from me
and l zag back into your arms.

26:33.801 --> 26:36.344
You know,
l've got the galleys of this book by Ogilvy.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.763
Learned a lot about advertising.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.600
Then why aren't you eating dinner
with Ogilvy?

26:42.685 --> 26:45.228
'Cause Campbell talked me out of it.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.692
Now let's get one thing straight.

26:51.360 --> 26:55.029
lfjai alai fails, it's your fault.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.826
l'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

26:59.910 --> 27:03.371
Don't apologize. Everybody thinks that.
Nobody says it.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.720
Are you removing that or moving it?

27:18.804 --> 27:21.556
Did everybody in Manhattan decide
l'm not allowed to live here?

27:21.640 --> 27:26.144
No. Actually, l think the right girl
could have a very good effect on you.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.064
l do, however, find your ad unfortunate.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.151
lt's perfect. l proofed it thoroughly.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.738
"Clean, responsible, considerate.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.949
"l have some nice furniture
and a small television."

27:40.034 --> 27:43.453
lt reads like the stage directions
from an lbsen play.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.331
So what, then? You'll give me some ideas,

27:46.415 --> 27:49.167
and l'll use them,
and you'll all have an even bigger laugh?

27:49.251 --> 27:52.003
No, l thought l'd tell you
how to get a roommate.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.838
This is not the way.

27:55.758 --> 27:56.841
Fine.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.637
Please, Joan, tell me how to do it.

28:02.848 --> 28:07.602
-For one thing, why "Margaret"?
-lt's my name and it's more adult.

28:08.187 --> 28:12.940
But this is about two young girls
in Manhattan. This is about an adventure.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.401
Am l wrong?

28:16.737 --> 28:19.655
lf this were me, l would say something like,

28:20.282 --> 28:23.618
"Fun-loving girl, responsible sometimes.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.913
"Likes to laugh. Lives to love.

28:26.997 --> 28:30.541
"Seeks size six for city living
and general gallivanting.

28:30.626 --> 28:34.629
"No dull moments or dull men tolerated."
Or something like that.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.716
Well, thank you. That's very helpful.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.220
And don't put it up there.
Everyone here knows you.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.389
Branch out.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.558
Good night, Peggy.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.918
Don. There you are.

29:56.336 --> 29:59.630
l was just on my way over to Lane.
l've got signatures.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.925
Horace Cook, Jr. is all dressed
and ready for the oven.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.635
ln light of all of the trepidation,

30:04.720 --> 30:07.889
perhaps you should deliver this
to Lane yourself.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.815
-Are you following me?
-l spent two years at Dartmouth

30:17.900 --> 30:21.068
hiding him from shylocks.
Let me enjoy my payday.

30:25.908 --> 30:28.910
Mr. Hooker,
has Lane stopped by the clubhouse?

30:29.411 --> 30:31.204
l'll go and get him.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.875
That's called a cesta.
lt's made of reeds from the Pyrenees.

30:35.959 --> 30:39.587
The ball is called a pelota.
They just sent all this over.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.218
So did Horace have any more ideas?

30:45.302 --> 30:48.012
For one thing,
he wants us to call it the NJAA.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.641
National Jai Alai Association?

30:52.226 --> 30:56.062
He has no idea how confused
America's gonna be about that "J."

30:56.438 --> 30:58.481
Look at this camaraderie.

30:58.941 --> 31:01.651
Perhaps we've discovered
America's pastime after all.

31:01.735 --> 31:03.361
Full steam ahead.

31:04.029 --> 31:07.573
-Bravo, boys.
-How about Patxi: The Motion Picture?

31:08.325 --> 31:09.951
God, l wish l was a part of this.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.955
l've informed the home office.
There was a flutter of adding machines.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.540
Well, you heard him, boys.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.042
Don't stop until you see the whites
of his pockets.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.377
Cosgrove.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.213
Good God.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.971
Bill it to the kid.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.732
-What the hell is that?
-lt's an English muffin.

31:41.817 --> 31:44.902
The hell it is. Put it away.
You can eat at school.

31:44.987 --> 31:47.113
l already ate my breakfast.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.158
Well, don't keep me waiting this afternoon.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.328
l want you dressed and ready for ballet
at 3:00 on the button.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.163
-No dawdling.
-Okay.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.544
l'm gonna buy fruit. What do you want?

32:02.087 --> 32:04.964
-Peaches, please.
-Peaches give me a rash.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.133
Your sister likes them.

32:10.846 --> 32:13.180
Are you Peggy?
They just sent me back from reception.

32:13.265 --> 32:17.059
-l'm Karen Ericson.
-Yes, l am. How nice to finally meet you.

32:18.604 --> 32:23.858
You have your own office.
Wowee! At the travel agency, it takes years,

32:23.942 --> 32:26.944
and Martha Winston's the only girl,
and she's married to the boss.

32:27.029 --> 32:28.946
Well, it's different up here.

32:29.031 --> 32:32.283
Everyone on the first floor
loved your humorous ad.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.785
You seem like someone
l could really be friends with,

32:34.870 --> 32:36.746
not like the last girl.

32:37.122 --> 32:41.542
Well, l'm fun and l love to have fun.

32:42.753 --> 32:44.587
She was always keeping her door shut,

32:44.671 --> 32:47.548
and l think you should only close your door
for one reason.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.050
What's that?

32:52.721 --> 32:55.139
l just don't get along with women
like l do men,

32:55.223 --> 32:58.476
but she left to get married,
so l must be some kind of good-luck charm.

32:58.560 --> 33:02.104
-Do you have a steady?
-No, l'm still playing the field.

33:02.356 --> 33:06.067
There are so many interesting men
out there. Except sailors.

33:06.234 --> 33:09.862
l have a couple of rules.
One of them is l don't like sailors.

33:09.946 --> 33:14.533
-No sailors. l agree.
-So, Peggy Olson, l have to ask,

33:15.202 --> 33:18.621
-are you Swedish? Because l am.
-Norwegian.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.918
Well, we won't tell my parents.

33:24.252 --> 33:28.005
l'll make appointments and come by at 5:00.
Or do you want your girl to do it?

33:28.090 --> 33:30.132
l finish up around 6:00.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.551
-Well, then tomorrow?
-Most days.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.804
Can we look on Saturday?

33:34.888 --> 33:37.014
-But not this Saturday...
-You work on Saturday?

33:37.099 --> 33:39.433
Not every Saturday.
And Saturday nights never.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.019
l'm out in the city, ready for fun.

33:42.437 --> 33:45.106
Well, okay. l'll call you, roomie.

33:47.234 --> 33:49.026
l got you a sandwich.

33:50.112 --> 33:53.906
-l'm gonna walk around the park.
-Well, have fun, roomie.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.051
lt's Mommy.

34:20.434 --> 34:23.561
-Where's Grandpa Gene?
-lt must've slipped his mind.

34:23.645 --> 34:26.147
-Where is he?
-Probably at home.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.400
l'm sure he'll be there when we get home.

34:46.877 --> 34:51.046
Bye, bye, sugar

34:51.256 --> 34:54.133
Hello, Patio

34:57.179 --> 35:00.681
When the cake
is on the plate

35:01.516 --> 35:04.518
I'm afraid
to gain the weight

35:04.603 --> 35:09.398
But now I have
some extra room

35:09.691 --> 35:12.777
Patio,
you make me swoon

35:13.570 --> 35:15.529
Diet cola tastes divine

35:15.614 --> 35:17.615
Get your own,
'cause this one's mine

35:17.699 --> 35:19.617
It's the brand new
slender you

35:19.701 --> 35:23.496
Now we'll have you
singing too

35:23.872 --> 35:27.917
Bye, bye, sugar

35:28.210 --> 35:31.420
It's great
to see you go

35:31.505 --> 35:36.133
So bye, bye, sugar

35:36.384 --> 35:48.521
Hello, Patio

35:56.905 --> 36:02.034
-l can't even tell you how thorough Sal was.
-Well, l appreciate that, but this is...

36:02.494 --> 36:05.204
l don't know.
This is not what l thought it was gonna be.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.039
Glad l'm not alone.

36:07.624 --> 36:11.502
Look, l don't think there's any ambiguity
about this being exactly,

36:11.586 --> 36:13.963
and l mean exactly, what you asked for.

36:14.047 --> 36:17.216
l know,
but there's something not right about it.

36:18.093 --> 36:22.096
-What?
-l can't put my finger on it.

36:22.472 --> 36:26.600
-l wish l could, but l can't.
-lt's an exact copy, frame for frame.

36:27.644 --> 36:31.355
l'll tell you what. Why don't we send a dupe
back to the office with you?

36:31.439 --> 36:33.190
No. l'm sorry.

36:33.817 --> 36:37.111
l wish l could explain it,
but it's just not right.

36:38.321 --> 36:42.241
l'm gonna be magnanimous
and say it's our idea and our failure,

36:43.368 --> 36:45.119
but it is a failure.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.372
That is magnanimous.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.335
-l'm sorry about that.
-Maybe next time.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.763
lt's true. lt's not right.
lt doesn't make any sense. lt looks right,

37:04.848 --> 37:08.851
it sounds right, smells right.
Something's not right. What is it?

37:09.144 --> 37:10.978
lt's not Ann-Margret.

37:27.871 --> 37:30.331
Mommy, there's a policeman! Hurry!

37:36.463 --> 37:38.756
Yes, may l help you?

37:38.840 --> 37:42.551
-Are you related to Eugene Hofstadt?
-Yes, l am. What is it?

37:43.929 --> 37:46.472
We regret to inform you
that he passed away.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.182
-Oh, God.
-No! No!

37:48.892 --> 37:50.184
l'm fine.

37:52.854 --> 37:56.023
-What happened?
-He collapsed in line at the A&P.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.317
l'm so sorry, ma'am.

38:01.237 --> 38:05.032
l...

38:06.701 --> 38:10.329
Well, we need to know
what you'd like to do with his body.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.916
Yes, of course.

38:34.854 --> 38:38.399
-Mr. Romano's here to see you.
-Send him in.

38:42.696 --> 38:45.572
l figured l'd bring myself to the woodshed.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.283
lt must be horrible
having a client insist on something

38:48.368 --> 38:50.327
and then change their mind
once they've seen it.

38:50.412 --> 38:54.748
-l hope it never happens to me.
-l was the director and l let you down.

38:57.544 --> 39:00.421
-l'm in a meeting.
-l have Mrs. Draper on the line.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.090
-lt's urgent.
-l can go.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.471
What's the matter?

39:16.604 --> 39:18.272
l'm sorry, Betts.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.524
l'm...

39:21.776 --> 39:23.277
l'm very sorry.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.614
Do you want me to call William?

39:30.160 --> 39:32.661
Just stay put. l'll be right there.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.292
-l have to go.
-ls everything okay?

39:39.753 --> 39:41.837
There's nothing you can do.

39:42.756 --> 39:45.799
Don't ruin the only good thing
to come of this.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.969
You are now a commercial director.

39:51.097 --> 39:54.141
How do l know you're not just saying that
to make me feel better?

39:54.225 --> 39:56.810
You'll know when l hire you again.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.897
Allison, l'm going for the day.

40:07.781 --> 40:09.031
Okay, Ma.

40:10.492 --> 40:13.494
Oh, my goodness. lt's beautiful.

40:14.621 --> 40:18.499
ls that all the noise that this was?
Why didn't you wait for Gerry to help?

40:18.583 --> 40:21.085
Because he's playing cards
and Peggy gets up early.

40:21.169 --> 40:24.004
-Say thank you, Ma.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.509
An Admiral. You must be doing well.

40:29.636 --> 40:32.721
-l am.
-What's the matter, peaches?

40:34.808 --> 40:36.266
Sit down, Ma.

40:38.311 --> 40:39.978
What's this about?

40:41.022 --> 40:43.398
Don't, Anita. Stay.

40:46.820 --> 40:50.322
Ma, l'm having problems with my apartment,

40:50.865 --> 40:53.325
and my commute is very long and...

40:54.953 --> 40:57.871
lt doesn't mean nothing
if you want to stay here with us.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.832
Your father and l lived
with grandma and grandpa for years.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.042
Your sister was born there.

41:04.212 --> 41:07.047
Ma, l'm getting an apartment in Manhattan.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.764
-Well, that makes sense.
-lt really does.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.183
Yeah, l guess l'm the kind of mother

41:18.268 --> 41:20.519
who'd rather have a new TV
than a daughter.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.105
l got you a new TV
because you needed one.

41:23.189 --> 41:26.150
You got me a new TV
'cause you think l was born yesterday.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.152
You belong in the city.

41:29.070 --> 41:32.906
Do you see this, Anita?
This is what they do. Family is cheap.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.825
Well, take it back, okay?

41:34.909 --> 41:37.828
Because it's just going to remind me
of how stupid you think l am.

41:37.912 --> 41:41.081
Ma! You knew she'd have
to move there eventually.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.172
Now, someday both of you
are going to feel this,

41:48.256 --> 41:51.175
this... This broken heart l'm carrying.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.015
You'll get raped, you know that?

41:59.684 --> 42:03.687
lt's just as dangerous as here,
and l'm going to have a roommate.

42:03.813 --> 42:07.649
She's a nice girl. Her name
is Karen Ericson. She's Norwegian.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.694
-There's a man, isn't there?
-No.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.239
Why would l ever believe anything you say?

42:14.324 --> 42:16.658
Stop it, Ma. You're being cruel.

42:19.287 --> 42:20.829
Good night, Ma.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.508
-That wasn't so bad.
-Really?

42:35.094 --> 42:37.387
She's been through a lot of change lately.

42:37.472 --> 42:40.641
The Holy Father dying,
that was very hard on her.

42:42.644 --> 42:44.061
It has become one country

42:44.145 --> 42:47.231
because all of us
and all the people who came here

42:47.315 --> 42:49.775
had an equal chance
to develop their talents.

42:49.859 --> 42:54.154
We cannot say to 10% of the population
that you can't have that right,

42:54.239 --> 42:56.657
that your children can't have the chance
to develop whatever talent...

42:56.741 --> 43:04.748
Eugene Hofstadt, number two.

43:07.126 --> 43:08.877
What does that mean?

43:09.671 --> 43:12.589
There were two Eugene Hofstadts
at his bank,

43:12.966 --> 43:16.218
so he had to be called Eugene Hofstadt,
number two.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.347
Well, he's with Ruth now.

43:22.350 --> 43:23.684
l hope so.

43:26.479 --> 43:27.980
Once he asked,

43:28.648 --> 43:32.609
"What's gonna happen when l get to heaven
and l have two wives?"

43:33.528 --> 43:37.030
Knowing Gloria,
l don't think that's gonna be a problem.

43:44.414 --> 43:47.582
Betts, don't eat that.
lt was in his car all day.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.626
l don't care.

43:51.921 --> 43:54.798
-Why are you laughing?
-Sally, sweetheart...

43:54.882 --> 43:58.844
-We weren't laughing, honey.
-l heard you. l heard you laughing.

43:59.721 --> 44:02.472
How can you be sitting there
like nothing's happening?

44:02.557 --> 44:05.934
Like he's not gone?
He was here, now he's not here.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.687
He's gone forever
and nobody even knows that.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.022
Stop it.

44:10.898 --> 44:14.026
-You're being hysterical. Calm down.
-He's dead!

44:14.402 --> 44:18.780
He's dead and he's never coming back!
And nobody cares

44:19.073 --> 44:23.243
-that he's really, really, really gone!
-Sally, go watch TV!

44:35.423 --> 44:39.051
The United States army convoy
was delayed by soviet border guards,

44:39.135 --> 44:42.012
when the convoy commander
rejected commands that his troops

44:42.096 --> 44:44.514
leave their vehicles for a head count.

44:44.599 --> 44:48.143
The Russians finally allowed
the convoy to pass. Robert?

44:48.770 --> 44:51.563
Dumbstruck police
and horrified crowds gathered

44:51.647 --> 44:54.649
as an elderly Buddhist monk
set fire to himself today,

44:54.734 --> 44:58.195
resulting in his death.
The bizarre act was a protest

44:58.279 --> 45:02.657
against the mostly Catholic government
of Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam

45:02.742 --> 45:05.744
and their supposed campaign
of discrimination.

45:06.245 --> 45:10.374
The New York Stock Exchange today
saw slight gains in moderate trading

45:10.458 --> 45:14.086
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose nearly two points.

45:14.170 --> 45:17.339
And now here's Stan Baker
for Winston cigarettes.
