19:22.384 --> 19:24.150
By finding

19:24.152 --> 19:26.586
TV programs and films
with audio description,

19:26.588 --> 19:29.722

in the full experience.

19:34.729 --> 19:36.729
these clicking noises,
kind of like a dolphin.

19:36.731 --> 19:38.731
And the clicks bounce off of stuff,

19:38.733 --> 19:39.933
and he somehow figures out where he is

19:39.935 --> 19:41.467
so he doesn't crash into anything.

- REBECCA: Oh!

19:42.637 --> 19:44.637
that common, but Zak
wanted to give it a try.

19:44.639 --> 19:46.005
At first, I was afraid that using a cane

19:46.007 --> 19:47.073
would stigmatize me.

19:47.075 --> 19:48.775
But it's actually very empowering

19:48.777 --> 19:50.209
and gives me a lot of independence.

Um, sweetheart,

22:44.890 --> 22:49.816
He has been struggling
with Jack's blindness.

22:49.818 --> 22:53.359
And he said that every
time that he looks at Jack,

22:53.361 --> 22:54.794
it just makes him sad.

22:54.796 --> 22:56.262
Mm.

So... That's a direct quote.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.667
Yeah.

23:01.669 --> 23:04.303
He is struggling.

23:04.305 --> 23:06.507
And I'm not?

23:08.643 --> 23:11.644
He is supposed to be
running around, right,

23:11.646 --> 23:13.679

taking Jack to the pool.

me with something called
