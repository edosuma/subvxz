WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:08.909
(speaking Spanish)

00:08.909 --> 00:11.279
GEORGE,
YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.381
WE'RE HIPPIN' UP
THE CHRISTMAS MUSIC

00:13.381 --> 00:15.449
TO ATTRACT YOUNGER PEOPLE
TO THE CHURCH.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.950
HOW LONG YOU GUYS
GONNA BE PRACTICING?

00:16.950 --> 00:18.452
I GOT A LOT OF WORK
TO DO.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.953
WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE MORE SONG.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.090
WELL, HURRY UP.
I DON'T NEED TO BE

00:22.090 --> 00:24.125
LISTENIN' TO THIS STUFF
IN MY OWN HOUSE.

00:24.125 --> 00:29.230
* THE FIRST NOEL

00:29.230 --> 00:33.134
* THE ANGELS DID SAY

00:33.134 --> 00:37.305
* WAS TO CERTAIN
POOR SHEPHERDS *

00:37.305 --> 00:40.874
* IN FIELDS AS THEY LAY

00:40.874 --> 00:43.277
BREAK IT DOWN, Y'ALL.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.778
(scratching)

00:44.778 --> 00:46.847
(rapping)
* IN FIELDS AS THEY LAY

00:46.847 --> 00:48.015
* KEEPIN' THEIR SHEEP

00:48.015 --> 00:49.117
* ON A COLD WINTER'S NIGHT

00:49.117 --> 00:50.484
* THAT WAS SO DEEP

00:50.484 --> 00:52.486
* WHERE MY ANGELS AT?
HOLLA', GIRLS *

00:52.486 --> 00:54.455
* OOH, OOH,
OOH, OOH *

00:54.455 --> 00:56.157
* OOH, OOH,
OOH, OOH *

00:56.157 --> 00:57.525
* OOH, OOH

00:57.525 --> 01:01.629
YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO STOP THIS.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.996
* OOH

01:02.996 --> 01:04.798
(scratching)

01:04.798 --> 01:06.066
* NOEL

01:06.066 --> 01:07.067
* NOEL

01:07.067 --> 01:08.068
* NOEL

01:08.068 --> 01:09.837
* NOEL

01:09.837 --> 01:13.207
* BORN IS THE KI-ZING

01:13.207 --> 01:20.080
* OF HIZ-IZ-RAEL

01:20.080 --> 01:23.884
(speaking Spanish)

01:23.884 --> 01:28.222
SO WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF OUR NEW SOUND, GEORGE?

01:28.222 --> 01:31.058
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.760
I THINK IT'S GREAT, FATHER.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.962
FORGIVE ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE JUST LIED.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.797
OH.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.300
SO WE'LL REHEARSE HERE AGAIN
NEXT WEDNESDAY, FATHER.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.170
DO YOU MIND, GEORGE?

01:42.170 --> 01:43.704
FATHER...

01:43.704 --> 01:45.906
I WANNA DO WHATEVER
ANGIE WANTS TO DO.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.208
AW.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.009
(laughs)

01:49.009 --> 01:52.012
SAY, HAVE YOU TWO
EVER CONSIDERED

01:52.012 --> 01:54.081
DOING SOME
MARRIAGE COUNSELING?

01:54.081 --> 01:55.883
I DON'T THINK SO, FATHER.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.885
I THINK ONCE THE KIDS
ARE OUT OF THE HOUSE,

01:57.885 --> 01:59.187
WE'LL FIND A WAY
TO MAKE IT WORK AGAIN.

01:59.187 --> 02:02.156
NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:02.156 --> 02:05.393
BECAUSE I THINK YOU TWO HAVE ONE
OF THE STRONGEST RELATIONSHIPS

02:05.393 --> 02:07.395
IN THE CONGREGATION.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.397
GEORGE AND I WOULD LOVE
TO HELP OUT, FATHER.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.632
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.202
DON'T JUST
JUMP AT IT, ANGIE.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.136
HOW MUCH DOES IT PAY?
GEORGE.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.939
IT'S ONLY FIVE MONDAYS,
GEORGE.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.542
I DON'T THINK SO, FATHER.
I'M PRETTY BUSY AT WORK.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.143
I KNOW YOU'VE TAKEN
THE VOW OF POVERTY,

02:23.143 --> 02:25.413
BUT I CAN'T WEAR THE SAME
CLOTHES TO WORK EVERY DAY.

02:26.914 --> 02:30.117
THAT'S TOO BAD, GEORGE,
BECAUSE MY SERMON THIS SUNDAY

02:30.117 --> 02:32.119
WAS GOING TO BE
"HEROES OF THE CHURCH,"

02:32.119 --> 02:34.755
AND I HAVE ONE MORE OPENING.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.191
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT, FATHER,
BUT UNDER ONE CONDITION.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.026
I DON'T WANNA SIT
ON THE WOODEN PEWS.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.363
I LIKE A SOFT CHAIR WITH
A CUPHOLDER LIKE AT THE MOVIES.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.064
I CANNOT DO THAT, GEORGE.

02:44.064 --> 02:47.335
WE'LL BE THERE, FATHER.
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT AGAIN, HUH?

02:47.335 --> 02:50.271
OKAY,
IF I CAN'T HAVE THE CHAIR,

02:50.271 --> 02:52.072
HOW ABOUT IF YOU PUT ME
IN THE BACKGROUND

02:52.072 --> 02:56.009
OF ONE OF THE STAINED GLASS
WINDOWS LIKE THIS?

02:56.009 --> 02:58.011
HOW ABOUT AS A WAITER
AT THE LAST SUPPER,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.913
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT KNOWS WHAT JUDAS IS UP TO?

02:59.913 --> 03:02.750
HE'S SITTING RIGHT THERE,
I'M LIKE...

03:07.788 --> 03:09.857
OKAY, NEXT TOPIC.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.325
VERY IMPORTANT.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.527
DEALING WITH FINANCES.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.863
OH, WE HAVEN'T REALLY
TALKED ABOUT THAT.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.665
WELL, YOU NEED TO.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.667
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE
CAUSE OF DIVORCE.

03:19.667 --> 03:23.036
YOU WANNA TELL THEM HOW WE SHARE
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.806
LOVE CONQUERS EVERYTHING.

03:30.844 --> 03:34.515
I BALANCE THE CHECKBOOK WHILE
GEORGE HANDLES OUR SAVINGS.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.484
YEAH, BUT WITH ALL THE CHECKS
SHE WRITES,

03:36.484 --> 03:38.486
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ANY SAVINGS.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.593
YOU SEE, HUMOR'S VERY IMPORTANT
IN A MARRIAGE.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.297
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

03:49.297 --> 03:51.098
BENNY, THIS IS
ANDREW AND TINA.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.934
WE'RE DOING PREMARITAL
COUNSELING FOR THEM.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.504
HOLY CRAP.

03:58.171 --> 04:01.709
YOU'RE GIVING MARRIAGE ADVICE?

04:01.709 --> 04:04.745
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
AFTER THIS...

04:04.745 --> 04:07.815
A DRIVING LESSON
WITH STEVIE WONDER?

04:11.385 --> 04:13.521
ENJOY YOUR SMOKE, MOTHER.

04:15.523 --> 04:19.293
HOW ARE YOUR RELATIONS
WITH YOUR FUTURE IN-LAWS?

04:19.293 --> 04:21.228
BOTH OUR PARENTS
PASSED AWAY.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.597
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:24.798 --> 04:28.436
OKAY, UH, DO YOU PLAN
ON HAVING CHILDREN?

04:28.436 --> 04:30.604
YES.
YES.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.474
ARE YOU PLANNING ON WORKING
AFTER HAVING CHILDREN?

04:33.474 --> 04:35.376
NO, I WANNA STAY HOME
AND RAISE THE KIDS.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.378
OH, THAT'S WHAT I DID.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.380
IT'S THE HARDEST JOB
YOU CAN EVER HAVE.

04:39.380 --> 04:44.251
YEAH, IT'S THE HARDEST JOB
YOU CAN EVER HAVE.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.620
SEE, I WORK IN A FACTORY.
THAT'S EASY.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.622
WHEN MY BOSS
IS SCREAMIN' AT ME,

04:48.622 --> 04:50.858
I JUST PUT HIM
ON MY BOOB TO SUCKLE.

04:50.858 --> 04:54.395
IT SHUTS HIM RIGHT UP.
THAT'S OKAY.

04:54.395 --> 04:58.432
THAT'S OKAY.
THE BUDGET CAN WAIT.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.434
I'M NOT SAYING
WHAT YOU DO ISN'T HARD,

05:00.434 --> 05:02.503
BUT WE AGREED
THAT A HEALTHY MARRIAGE

05:02.503 --> 05:04.838
IS A 50-50 PARTNERSHIP.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.239
ABSOLUTELY.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.943
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID,
AND THAT'S WHAT I AGREED TO.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.745
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:11.745 --> 05:13.714
YOUR WORKBOOK HAS
MORE MATERIAL ON FINANCES.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.083
WE SHOULD MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT TOPIC,

05:16.083 --> 05:18.719
UM, WHICH IS INTIMACY.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.521
OKAY.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.289
I THINK I GOT IT FROM HERE.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.091
WELCOME TO MY SCHOOLHOUSE,

05:24.091 --> 05:26.293
WHERE THE VERY BEST GRADE
YOU CAN GET IS BAD,

05:26.293 --> 05:29.530
AND I MEAN VERY BAD.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.198
IT'S NOT WRITTEN RIGHT THERE,

05:31.198 --> 05:33.934
BUT JUST REMEMBER
THE FREAKS COME OUT AT NIGHT.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.737
GEORGE!

05:36.737 --> 05:41.542
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THIS
SEPARATELY, HUH?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.512
ALL RIGHT, ANDREW,
COME WITH ME.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.814
REMEMBER,
THE KEY TO INTIMACY ISN'T SEX.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.816
IT'S ABOUT LISTENING
TO YOUR PARTNER

05:48.816 --> 05:51.018
AND RESPONDING
TO HER NEEDS.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.823
ONE WAY
TO TRUE INTIMACY IS...

05:55.823 --> 05:59.527
LOOK, JUST LIGHT CANDLES
AND HUG HER WHEN IT'S OVER, MAN.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.429
LET'S JUST WATCH TV.

06:03.431 --> 06:06.567
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

06:10.037 --> 06:12.506
* ALL MY FRIENDS

06:12.506 --> 06:14.742
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

06:17.010 --> 06:19.146
* THE LOW RIDER

06:19.146 --> 06:21.849
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

06:34.462 --> 06:37.931
(game playing on television)

06:37.931 --> 06:41.635
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE REALLY
SATISFIED YOUR WIFE IN BED?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.208
TAKE IT EASY, MAN.
RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

06:48.208 --> 06:50.611
THERE'S BOOKS AND TAPES
ON THIS STUFF.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.447
ARE THERE ANY
YOU RECOMMEND?

06:53.447 --> 06:56.917
WELL, DUDE, I DON'T NEED 'EM,
BECAUSE I'M A NATURAL.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.286
AH, COOL,
YOU GOT THE GAME ON.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.321
HEY, ERNIE, THIS IS ANDREW,

07:01.321 --> 07:03.524
THE GUY THAT'S GETTIN' MARRIED
THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.493
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.827
SO, UM,
WHAT DID YOU LEARN SO FAR?

07:06.827 --> 07:09.029
I HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT FINANCES.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.798
HUMOR'S IMPORTANT.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.601
AND IT'S A PARTNERSHIP.
YOU GOTTA SHARE THE WORK 50-50.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.604
BUT YOU ALWAYS COMPLAIN
THAT YOU DO MORE WORK,

07:16.604 --> 07:18.706
LIKE IT'S 80-20.

07:21.609 --> 07:25.813
MR. LOPEZ, YOU AGREED
WITH YOUR WIFE IT WAS 50-50.

07:25.813 --> 07:30.050
"YOU AGREED WITH YOUR WIFE
IT WAS 50-50."

07:33.320 --> 07:37.525
LOOK, I SAID WHAT I DID IN THERE
BECAUSE THIS COUNSELING STUFF

07:37.525 --> 07:39.527
IS LIKE TRAFFIC SCHOOL,
ALL RIGHT?

07:39.527 --> 07:42.863
WE JUST GOTTA GET THROUGH IT.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.966
LYING IS PART OF MARRIAGE.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.903
ALL RIGHT, AND YOU CAN
TRUST ME ON THAT,

07:49.903 --> 07:52.740
BECAUSE I'M A HERO
OF THE CHURCH.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.377
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST

07:57.377 --> 07:59.680
WITH YOUR WIFE ALL THE TIME.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.383
I'M SORRY,
ARE YOU THE COUNSELOR

08:03.383 --> 08:06.587
AND I'M THE GUY WHO DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO SATISFY HIS WIFE?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.556
THAT WAS A LITTLE HARSH.

08:08.556 --> 08:12.593
LOOK, I CAN'T LET YOU GO INTO
THIS WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.629
YOU HAVE UNREALISTIC
EXPECTATIONS, ALL RIGHT?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.097
I LOVE MY WIFE,
I RESPECT HER,

08:17.097 --> 08:18.966
BUT I DO MORE
OF THE WORK!

08:18.966 --> 08:20.701
LISTEN UP, ROOKIE,
HERE'S MY DAY--

08:20.701 --> 08:23.871
OKAY, I'M UP AT 6,
I BRING IN THE PAPER,

08:23.871 --> 08:26.840
I TAKE OUT THE TRASH,
THEN I GO TO WORK FOR TEN HOURS

08:26.840 --> 08:28.441
AND COME HOME
TO A LIST OF CHORES.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.845
HERE'S MY WIFE'S DAY--
SHE MAKES A LIST OF CHORES!

08:33.814 --> 08:36.316
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE SHE DOES,

08:36.316 --> 08:39.953
BUT APPARENTLY,
"IT'S JUST SO EXHAUSTING."

08:39.953 --> 08:42.556
MAN, 80-20?

08:42.556 --> 08:46.026
I'M WORKIN' OVERTIME
AS IT IS.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.129
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
HANDLE ANY MORE.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.899
WELL, YOU GOT THE RINGS
AND THE TUX.

08:51.899 --> 08:55.302
MAYBE YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT
AS YOU WALK DOWN THE AISLE.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.472
CAN I HAVE A BEER?

08:59.472 --> 09:02.976
YEAH, MAN, THEY'RE IN
THE FRIDGE. HELP YOURSELF.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.785
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

09:11.785 --> 09:15.823
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DO
THIS COUNSELING STUFF,

09:15.823 --> 09:18.191
BUT I THINK THAT
I'M REALLY GOOD AT IT.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.328
HEY, MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME
WITH MY DATING PROBLEM.

09:21.328 --> 09:26.133
DUDE, I JUST TALK TO PEOPLE.
I DON'T HAVE MAGICAL POWERS.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.740
(knock on door)

09:35.175 --> 09:36.543
TINA?

09:36.543 --> 09:37.811
IT'S OVER.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.948
ANDREW DOESN'T WANT
TO GET MARRIED.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.754
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

09:46.754 --> 09:48.889
HE SAID
HE COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

09:48.889 --> 09:49.790
80-20?

09:49.790 --> 09:53.861
HE SAID THE WORKLOAD
WAS 80-20.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.466
I'M GONNA BE IN THE GARAGE.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.068
DREAM KILLER!

10:03.336 --> 10:05.873
YOU KNOW, IT'S ACTUALLY
"DREAM WEAVER,"

10:05.873 --> 10:09.743
AND IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
IT'S IN THE GARAGE.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.745
WHAT IS GOING ON?

10:11.745 --> 10:16.750
ANDREW SAID THAT YOU TOLD HIM
THAT YOUR MARRIAGE WASN'T 50-50,

10:16.750 --> 10:19.619
THAT YOU DO ALL THE WORK
AND ALL THAT SHE DOES

10:19.619 --> 10:23.056
IS MAKE LISTS OF
MORE WORK FOR YOU TO DO.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.327
GEORGE...

10:27.327 --> 10:30.931
TINA, DO WHATEVER YOU CAN
TO GET THAT MAN BACK,

10:30.931 --> 10:33.000
BECAUSE HE REALLY LISTENS.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.777
I CALMED TINA DOWN.

10:43.777 --> 10:46.680
SHE WENT TO FIND ANDREW
TO WORK THIS OUT.

10:46.680 --> 10:51.051
WHY WOULD YOU TELL HIM
ALL THAT CRAP?

10:51.051 --> 10:53.887
I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS
GONNA CALL OFF THE WEDDING.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.824
CONGRATULATIONS, GEORGE.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.959
YOU HAVE RUINED
ONE RELATIONSHIP

10:58.959 --> 11:02.429
AND SEVERELY DAMAGED ANOTHER.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.598
WHICH ONE ARE WE?

11:05.598 --> 11:10.237
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU DO MORE THAN ME?

11:10.237 --> 11:12.405
ANGIE, I'M JUST SAYING
THAT WITH MY JOB AT THE FACTORY

11:12.405 --> 11:13.807
AND EVERYTHING I DO
AROUND THE HOUSE,

11:13.807 --> 11:15.642
I GOT A LOT ON MY PLATE.

11:15.642 --> 11:18.011
THE ONLY REASON THERE'S
ANYTHING ON YOUR PLATE

11:18.011 --> 11:19.880
IS BECAUSE I DO
ALL THE COOKING,

11:19.880 --> 11:23.951
AND I DRIVE THE KIDS AROUND
AND I CLEAN THE HOUSE

11:23.951 --> 11:26.053
AND RUN A BUSINESS
ON THE SIDE.

11:26.053 --> 11:30.057
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE BUSY MORNINGS.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.263
DAMN IT, I WORK ALL DAY.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.265
SORRY, OKAY, I KNOW,
I KNOW, ALL RIGHT?

11:38.265 --> 11:41.301
SOMETIMES I TAKE FOR GRANTED
EVERYTHING YOU DO AROUND HERE.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.771
BY THE WAY, WHAT WAS
ON "OPRAH" YESTERDAY?

11:50.077 --> 11:55.115
IT WAS ABOUT CLUELESS HUSBANDS

11:55.115 --> 11:57.317
WHO DON'T REALIZE THAT
WIVES CAN DO HOUSEWORK

11:57.317 --> 12:00.320
AND WATCH TV
AT THE SAME TIME.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.290
SOUNDS A LITTLE CONVENIENT,
BUT OKAY.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.225
LOOK, WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHO DOES MORE, HUH?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.895
THIS ISN'T A CONTEST, ANGIE.
WE'RE NOT KEEPIN' SCORE.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.196
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.765
LET'S HAVE A CONTEST
AND KEEP SCORE.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.001
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS,
ANGIE.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.936
WHY? ARE YOU AFRAID
WHEN WE ADD IT ALL UP,

12:15.936 --> 12:18.238
I'LL PROVE I DO A LOT MORE
THAN YOUR GOLF-PLAYING,

12:18.238 --> 12:21.341
TV-WATCHING, CIGAR-SMOKING,
LAZY BUTT?

12:23.676 --> 12:25.345
OKAY.

12:25.345 --> 12:30.283
JUST LIKE THE TV IN THIS HOUSE
IN THE AFTERNOON, IT'S ON!

12:32.652 --> 12:36.389
WHOEVER LOSES HAS TO DO ALL
THE WINNER'S CHORES FOR A MONTH.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.026
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED
A POINT SYSTEM.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.694
I THINK WORK AROUND THE HOUSE
SHOULD BE WORTH 5 POINTS,

12:41.694 --> 12:43.196
ANYTHING WITH THE KIDS, 10,

12:43.196 --> 12:45.732
ANYTHING HAVING TO DO
WITH OUR JOBS, 5 POINTS AN HOUR.

12:45.732 --> 12:51.071
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER STUFF
THAT WE DO FOR EACH OTHER?

12:57.210 --> 13:00.047
LIKE WHAT?

13:00.047 --> 13:05.085
LAST NIGHT, I THINK I EARNED
A GOOD 30 POINTS.

13:05.085 --> 13:08.255
AND BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

13:12.159 --> 13:15.062
I'M GONNA GIVE MYSELF
5 POINTS FOR THAT.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.964
WHY SHOULD YOU GET
THE POINTS?

13:16.964 --> 13:20.300
BECAUSE I CONSIDER THAT
A HOUSEHOLD CHORE.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.738
REALLY?

13:25.738 --> 13:30.343
'CAUSE YOU DON'T MAKE FACES LIKE
THAT WHEN YOU'RE FOLDIN' SOCKS.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.118
WHAT?

13:38.118 --> 13:41.321
IT SAID IT'S ON.
IT'S ON!

13:46.960 --> 13:49.997
MY LOCKER IS RIGHT BY HIS,

13:49.997 --> 13:51.999
AND WE SEE EACH OTHER
EVERY DAY.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.234
AND THEN FINALLY,
I SAY,

13:54.234 --> 13:59.139
"HI, TONY," AND HE SAYS,
"HI, JANET."

13:59.139 --> 14:03.043
MY NAME IS NOT JANET!

14:03.043 --> 14:10.250
HONEY, I'M SORRY.
BOYS CAN BE SO CRUEL.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.251
YEAH.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.724
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:17.724 --> 14:20.127
NOTHING.

14:20.127 --> 14:23.530
"LISTENING TO DAUGHTER--
10 POINTS."

14:26.133 --> 14:28.135
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

14:28.135 --> 14:30.003
WELL, HONEY, IT'S NOTHING.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.439
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
BETWEEN ME AND YOUR DAD.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.641
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.243
NOW GO CLEAN YOUR ROOM.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.517
HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN?

14:44.517 --> 14:47.354
DAD TOOK ME TO THAT
NEW SKATE PARK. IT WAS AWESOME.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.889
WE HAD THE BEST TIME,
DIDN'T WE, SON?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.259
I LOVE YOU.
GIVE ME A HUG.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.527
(whispering)
10 POINTS.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.831
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.268
HERE'S THAT CANDY BAR
YOU ASKED FOR, HONEY BEAR.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.372
I WANTED YOUR MOM TO SEE THIS.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.608
JUST FED HIM LUNCH.
10 MORE.

15:10.143 --> 15:13.546
A CANDY BAR
DOES NOT COUNT AS LUNCH.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.849
WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT
TUNA SANDWICH YOU MADE ME

15:16.849 --> 15:19.052
COUNTED AS LUNCH, EITHER.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.421
I STILL GAVE YOU THE POINTS.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.556
ALL NIGHT I WAS LIKE,
(trills).

15:25.325 --> 15:28.795
WELL, I JUST LISTENED
TO CARMEN'S BOY TROUBLES.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.097
THAT'S 10 FOR ME.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.100
JUST FOR LISTENING
TO HER TROUBLES? NO WAY!

15:33.100 --> 15:34.767
SHE'S STILL UPSET.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.270
YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS AND HELP
HER DEAL WITH HER FEELINGS?

15:37.270 --> 15:39.406
TAKE YOUR STINKIN' POINTS.

15:39.406 --> 15:44.011
HEY, WHERE'S MAX?
I PROMISED HIM A CONGA LESSON.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.745
HE'S INSIDE, DADDY.

15:45.745 --> 15:49.016
HEY, VIC, TELL ME HOW YOU
LEARNED TO PLAY BACK IN CUBA,

15:49.016 --> 15:52.919
'CAUSE I'D LOVE TO HEAR
THAT STORY.

15:52.919 --> 15:58.391
WELL, I WAS 6 WHEN I LEARNED
THE RHYTHM OF THE ISLAND.

15:58.391 --> 16:02.996
A LONE FISHERMAN WHO LIVED
DOWN THE ROAD IN A SHACK--

16:02.996 --> 16:06.466
PEPE THE CONGERO--

16:06.466 --> 16:10.370
SAW MY HANDS AND KNEW
THAT I HAD THE GIFT.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.178
IF WE BOTH HAVE TO LISTEN
TO THE STORY,

16:18.178 --> 16:20.147
WE BOTH GET THE POINTS.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.515
ONE DAY,
ON PEPE'S DEATHBED...

16:22.515 --> 16:24.517
YEAH, YEAH, HE DIED,
THE END, VERY SAD.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.786
LAUNDRY MUST BE DONE.
5 POINTS FOR ME.

16:26.786 --> 16:30.290
WHAT ARE THESE POINTS
YOU TWO ARE TALKING ABOUT?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.292
ANGIE AND I ARE FIGHTING ABOUT
WHICH ONE OF US

16:32.292 --> 16:34.727
DOES MORE WORK AROUND HERE,
SO WE DECIDED TO KEEP SCORE.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.895
ARE YOU CRAZY?

16:35.895 --> 16:38.098
THIS IS NOT A CONTEST
YOU CAN WIN.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.269
ACTUALLY, IT LOOKS LIKE
I CAN'T LOSE.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.237
SHE'S BEHIND 60 POINTS!

16:44.237 --> 16:45.905
NO, NO, NO, NO,
LISTEN TO ME.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.574
WHEN I WAS WITH EMELINA,

16:47.574 --> 16:50.510
I ALWAYS HAD TO BE
THE SUPERIOR ONE.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.246
I MADE HER FEEL LIKE
SHE WASN'T IMPORTANT.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.881
THEN ONE DAY,

16:54.881 --> 16:59.786
SHE LEFT ME FOR SOMEONE
WHO MADE HER FEEL LIKE SHE WAS.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.522
OH, VIC, ANGIE'S NOT GONNA
LEAVE ME OVER THIS.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.458
I DIDN'T THINK EMELINA
WAS GONNA LEAVE ME, EITHER.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.361
WHEN A WOMAN FEELS
UNAPPRECIATED,

17:08.361 --> 17:12.365
IT'S THE BEGINNING
OF SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS.

17:12.365 --> 17:16.069
LOOK, ANGIE THINKS WE DO
THE SAME AMOUNT OF WORK

17:16.069 --> 17:17.270
AROUND HERE
AND WE DON'T.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.507
SO WHAT?
LET HER THINK THAT.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.776
GEORGE, IT SEEMS LIKE
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

17:23.776 --> 17:26.246
FOR A LIFETIME OF HAPPINESS.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.381
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.619
I'D RATHER MAKE ANGIE HAPPY THAN
END UP SAD AND LONELY LIKE YOU.

17:40.193 --> 17:43.430
OKAY, IT'S 5:00.
YOU READY TO DO THIS?

17:43.430 --> 17:46.766
YEP. I JUST NEED TO ADD UP
MY SCORE.

17:46.766 --> 17:50.137
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEIR CONTEST IS FINALLY OVER.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.971
WHAT CONTEST?

17:51.971 --> 17:53.273
MAX, HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED?

17:53.273 --> 17:55.275
MOM AND DAD ARE TRYING TO PROVE
WHO DOES MORE,

17:55.275 --> 17:58.010
SO THEY GET POINTS WHENEVER
THEY SPEND TIME WITH US.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.646
WHAT?

17:59.646 --> 18:02.315
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON?

18:02.315 --> 18:05.452
SINCE YOU WERE 3.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.891
OKAY, YOU GO FIRST.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.960
I HAD 90 POINTS.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.962
OH, MAN!
I HAD 90 POINTS, TOO!

18:15.962 --> 18:19.266
IT'S A TIE! YOU WERE RIGHT!
OUR MARRIAGE IS 50-50!

18:20.467 --> 18:22.669
GUESS THAT MEANS THAT
WE'RE BOTH IMPORTANT

18:22.669 --> 18:27.073
AND I APPRECIATE YOU
AND YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE ME.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.642
YOU DIDN'T LET ME FINISH.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.779
I HAD 90 POINTS
UP UNTIL TODAY,

18:32.779 --> 18:34.947
PLUS ANOTHER 30.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.484
THAT MEANS
I HAVE 120 TOTAL,

18:37.484 --> 18:40.287
WHICH MEANS
I KICKED YOUR BUTT!

18:41.688 --> 18:45.525
* I WORK HARDER THAN YOU,
I WORK HARDER THAN YOU *

18:45.525 --> 18:49.529
* I WORK HARDER THAN YOU,
HUH, HUH, HUH, HUH, HUH *

18:49.529 --> 18:50.930
WELL, WHAT'S IMPORTANT...

18:50.930 --> 18:53.733
IS THAT YOU FEEL IMPORTANT.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.368
NO.

18:55.368 --> 19:00.072
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU
START DOIN' MY CHORES.

19:00.072 --> 19:03.543
GET BUSY, MRS. LOPEZ.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.179
LOOK, I WON, DAMN IT!

19:06.179 --> 19:07.414
SURE, YOU DID.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.450
I SAID WE TIED
TO PROTECT OUR MARRIAGE,

19:10.450 --> 19:13.453
BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT
OUR MARRIAGE ANYMORE! I WON!

19:13.453 --> 19:16.223
OH, YEAH? PROVE IT.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.390
UH...

19:18.991 --> 19:22.562
IT'S RIGHT HERE. I JUST NEED
SOME TAPE AND COUPLE OF HOURS.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.499
I WOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG
WITH THAT.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.736
YOU'VE GOTTA GET
DINNER STARTED.

19:29.736 --> 19:34.407
LOOK, ANGIE, WHO CARES
ABOUT WHO WON OR WHO LOST, HUH?

19:34.407 --> 19:37.844
I GOTTA ADMIT
SOMETHING TO YOU.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.580
ALL THAT STUFF THAT YOU DO
AROUND HERE,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.749
ESPECIALLY STUFF
WITH THE KIDS,

19:42.749 --> 19:44.917
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS SO HARD

19:44.917 --> 19:47.787
AND I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
TAKEN YOU FOR GRANTED.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.856
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.324
COME ON.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.726
OH, HONEY.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.795
OHH.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.465
NICE TRY.

19:58.465 --> 20:01.701
NOW I'VE GOT A GAME TO WATCH.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.704
WEAR SOMETHING SEXY
WHEN YOU VACUUM.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.543
I CAN'T!
THOSE BICYCLE SHORTS WORE OUT.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.745
THE STRING CAME OUT,
AND WHEN I PEDDLE...

20:21.688 --> 20:25.224
YOU'RE NOT DONE IRONING
MY SHIRTS HERE?

20:25.224 --> 20:28.361
NOT NOW.
MY GIRL'S ON.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.862
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.197
OPRAH.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.865
SHE FOUND THIS WOMAN
WHO WAS CHAINED IN THE BASEMENT

20:32.865 --> 20:34.401
FOR EIGHT YEARS,

20:34.401 --> 20:37.704
AND NOW SHE'S PAYIN' HER WAY
THROUGH LAW SCHOOL.

20:37.704 --> 20:40.807
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE

20:40.807 --> 20:42.909
IS GETTING SCOOTERS,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.445
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW IT.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.648
WELL, MY MEETING'S GONNA
RUN LATE TONIGHT,

20:48.648 --> 20:50.383
SO I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE HOME FOR DINNER.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.356
GEORGE,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

20:56.356 --> 20:59.292
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

20:59.292 --> 21:01.561
MY HAIR.
I GOT IT CUT TWO DAYS AGO.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.896
YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I TRY.

21:03.896 --> 21:08.167
I'M SORRY.
I'VE JUST BEEN SO BUSY.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.303
JUST GO, OKAY?
