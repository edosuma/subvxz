WEBVTT

02:09.797 --> 02:11.628
Pullo! Pullo!

02:40.119 --> 02:44.362
It's quite good but they are
far more handsome in real life.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.563
What are you doing?

03:10.691 --> 03:13.228
Sorry, sir. Just taking your likeness, sir.

03:13.361 --> 03:18.401
Taking my likeness?
What do you mean? Speak, thief!

03:22.370 --> 03:27.205
Sir, Aventine Cloth Dyers' Association
are paying me

03:27.333 --> 03:32.168
to do a mural of you and Lucius Vorenus
in the arena, sir.

03:33.506 --> 03:36.088
Explain yourself. Why would anybody do that?

03:36.217 --> 03:39.004
Why, sir? You're famous, sir.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.678
There's paintings of you all over.

03:42.807 --> 03:46.095
Not good accurate ones
like I'm gonna do, sir.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.766
- Famous?
— Certainly.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.436
- Me?
— The whole city loves you, sir.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.811
You and Magistrate Vorenus are symbols
of brotherly love and redemption.

03:58.948 --> 04:03.658
If you were in Rome today, I doubt there's
a lady wouldn't open her doors for Titus Pullo.

04:03.786 --> 04:06.402
Would you let me go, please, sir?

05:14.273 --> 05:17.686
Beautiful.
We own all of it, as far as the river.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.649
Lovely.

05:19.778 --> 05:23.145
Best get used to it.
Caesar might well exile me from the city.

05:23.282 --> 05:26.740
— Just for saving Pullo?
— We'll live off the land like peasants.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.531
— He wouldn't be so mean.
- He might do far worse.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.656
— Like what?
— Nothing. l'm joking.

05:46.430 --> 05:50.298
— I don't suppose we can lay down a blanket.
— I shouldn't think so.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.392
Well, if we ever do this again,
I'm not wearing my best.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.728
Too soft, you city girls.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.563
Hush you, I'm down here, aren't I?

05:58.692 --> 06:01.399
Get on with it before I die of cold.

06:04.532 --> 06:10.118
- How long like this?
— Till the priest rings his bell.

06:10.246 --> 06:12.328
Juno help me.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.583
— It's good earth, this.
- It's wet earth.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.329
Dark, loamy, not much clay.
You can grow anything in soil like this.

06:21.465 --> 06:25.128
— Where should we build the farmhouse?
— That ridge over there.

06:25.261 --> 06:28.469
Close to the water and wood,
good command of the valley.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.588
In case we get attacked by Gauls?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.931
You never know.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.977
You're meant to be pretending.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.767
lam.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.935
You're not.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.929
Come to Papa.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.890
Bitch.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.148
Well, how was the farm?

07:30.284 --> 07:33.321
Clarissa, wait till you see it.
It's beautiful.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.036
It's very fine, I'm sure.

07:36.165 --> 07:37.701
What's wrong?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.789
— You'll never guess.
- We won't.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.079
— Pullo ran away from hospital.
- What?

07:42.212 --> 07:45.545
Some carters found him
lying half dead by the Appian.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.006
— He asked to be brought here.
— Here?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.126
He's inside.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.595
Gods beneath us.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.939
He should not have been on his feet,
never mind on a horse.

08:04.068 --> 08:07.936
— His wounds have opened, fresh as flowers.
- Poor stupid thing.

08:08.072 --> 08:11.189
I've given him henbane to dull the pain
and immobilise him.

08:11.325 --> 08:15.159
If by any chance he lives,
he shouldn't move on any account

08:15.287 --> 08:17.744
for at least ten days and nights.

08:21.293 --> 08:24.126
I'll send him back to the country
as soon as he's mobile.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.666
He won't cause any trouble, not like this.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.881
Like old times.

08:46.360 --> 08:51.195
- Lucius Vorenus, sir.
— What are you doing here?

08:51.323 --> 08:53.939
— Where am |?
— Rome, in my house.

08:54.076 --> 08:57.159
You should be in the hospital at Avernum.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.245
And miss all the fun? Why am | tied up...

09:00.374 --> 09:03.081
What fun is that?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.917
We're famous, aren't we? Heroes.

09:06.046 --> 09:10.335
Songs, plays, pictures on walls?

09:11.176 --> 09:13.792
Damn foolish fuss. What of it?

09:13.929 --> 09:17.547
You are a slow one, aren't you?

09:17.683 --> 09:24.304
Women. Women. They like nothing better
than a man with a big name.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.604
Please. You are lucky to be breathing.
Even if you survive your wounds,

09:28.736 --> 09:33.400
Caesar will probably throw you
back in the arena and me with you.

09:34.742 --> 09:39.327
Do you think he'll do that? Throw us back in?

09:39.455 --> 09:43.289
I'll find out tomorrow. I've been summoned.

09:46.587 --> 09:51.502
Women, he says. If you took a woman now,
you'd come apart like an old sack.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.434
Just like old times.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.725
I don't mind.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.809
It's good to hear your father
laughing for a change.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.336
Eirene, it's good to see you.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.181
Fair enough.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.860
If you can't do it, that's all right too.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.575
Eirene?

11:43.704 --> 11:47.071
— What are you doing?
- Nothing. Nothing.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.163
Don't lie. What's that in your hand?

11:49.293 --> 11:51.955
We were just talking.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.248
— Talking?
— Catching up.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.714
You fool! What if you killed him? What then?

11:57.843 --> 12:00.505
Everybody would know it was you.

12:00.637 --> 12:04.095
A freedwoman who killed
her old master...very nice!

12:04.224 --> 12:06.180
Where would you go?

12:06.310 --> 12:08.926
— What would you do with yourself?
— She has a point.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.225
Go to bed. We'll say no more of this.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.692
She's looking well.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.193
Good night, Pullo.

12:40.969 --> 12:44.757
— Juno protect you.
- Don't worry.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.595
I can't keep Caesar waiting.

13:03.033 --> 13:07.026
Eirene, when you finish, check Pullo's
dressings and change them if need be.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.699
- Me?
— You.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.660
And feed him some porridge.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.886
Thank you.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.938
As of this day,
the kalends of February,

13:44.074 --> 13:49.239
our beloved father dictator
Gaius Julius Caesar has decreed

13:49.371 --> 13:55.537
that 100 new men be raised
to the Senate of the Republic.

13:55.669 --> 14:00.880
The third day before nones,
a public banquet will be held

14:01.008 --> 14:03.715
to celebrate those senators.

14:04.678 --> 14:08.546
Slaves and freedmen are not eligible.

14:08.682 --> 14:15.178
Any repetition of recent disorders
will be punished with severity.

14:19.609 --> 14:25.229
I shall divert the river here, you see,
by digging a canal to the Vatican hills.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.232
Splendid. You shall divert the river.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.984
Splendid and useful, I have no doubt.

14:31.121 --> 14:36.081
lndeed. It will prevent flooding
and give easier access to the Fields of Mars.

14:36.209 --> 14:41.749
And on the reclaimed land I shall build
new civic offices for the courts.

14:41.882 --> 14:45.374
I shall also construct a temple
to Venus Birthgiver.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.250
Another temple...excellent.

14:47.387 --> 14:53.633
But if we might for the moment speak
of this expansion of the Senate?

14:53.769 --> 14:55.725
We might.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.061
Gauls and Celts, old boy.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.808
Long—haired Gauls and blue—faced Celts.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.934
You're joking, of course.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.686
He is notjoking.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.484
Gauls and Celts...in the Senate?

15:08.617 --> 15:12.485
From the tribes that have served
Rome longest, the best of their nobility.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.236
l'm astonished.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.954
Good. Astonishment is my intent.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.622
Here comes the hero of the hour.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.419
What, no wreath of oak leaves?

15:27.135 --> 15:30.093
Well now, Vorenus, what am | to do with you?

15:30.972 --> 15:36.592
Defying my express orders, you dared interfere
in a legally sanctioned execution,

15:36.728 --> 15:40.437
an act of gross criminality and disobedience.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.191
l humbly apologise, sir. I have no excuse.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.528
You present me with a dilemma.

15:48.657 --> 15:52.115
By right, I could have you
thrown off the Tarpeian rock.

15:53.203 --> 15:59.745
But the people, simple souls that they are,
have made great heroes out of you and Pullo.

15:59.876 --> 16:05.542
If I were to punish you,
the people would be made extremely angry.

16:05.674 --> 16:10.213
I do not wish to make the people angry,
ergo, I cannot punish you.

16:10.345 --> 16:15.385
If I cannot punish you, I must reward you,
else I shall seem weak.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.133
Listen to this now, Cicero.

16:18.270 --> 16:24.641
By popular acclaim, I shall name
Lucius Vorenus a senator of Rome.

16:29.114 --> 16:32.026
Good?

16:32.159 --> 16:37.495
Now you're all astonished.
Vorenus, you look like you've seen the Gorgon.

16:37.622 --> 16:41.206
Excuse me, sir...l'm stunned.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.202
What do you say?
Will you speak for your people in the Senate?

16:46.256 --> 16:48.918
I'd be honoured to do so,
if you think me worthy.

16:49.050 --> 16:53.464
There's none worthier.
You shall make an excellent senator.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.468
Very touching.

16:57.601 --> 17:00.684
For the first few weeks,
you will stay close by me.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.519
- Learn the drill.
— Thank you, sir.

17:03.648 --> 17:08.859
Forgive me but really I must...
As a friend, | must...| must protest!

17:09.905 --> 17:14.899
A lowly pleb in the Senate?
That's going too far.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.571
No offence to you, Vorenus.

17:16.703 --> 17:21.914
I do not wish to jump in any arenas. I must
please the people in some other fashion.

17:22.042 --> 17:27.582
Build yet another temple. Kill someone.
The people are easy to please. Not this.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.922
| wish the Senate to be made
of the best men in Italy,

17:31.051 --> 17:33.588
notjust the richest old men in Rome.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.802
An intriguing notion.

17:58.078 --> 18:01.536
You'll make a lot of men very angry
with your Gauls and your Celts

18:01.665 --> 18:04.031
and your plebs and such.

18:04.167 --> 18:07.830
— Have to double your guard.
— That's what I told him. Will he listen?

18:07.963 --> 18:12.627
Guards can keep my enemies away.
They can do nothing about my friends.

18:12.759 --> 18:17.344
You don't mean me, do you?
I can assure you, l have no ill intentions.

18:17.472 --> 18:22.683
I know. Not that you are not perfectly capable
of any manner of wickedness.

18:22.811 --> 18:23.800
Thank you.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.145
If you were going to betray me,
you would have done it long ago.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.265
Don't think I wasn't tempted.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.983
So, no more guards then.
You will trust Fortune.

18:32.112 --> 18:36.355
- Very good. Very pious.
— Stop your grizzling, you old woman.

18:37.909 --> 18:43.495
Who will dare raise a hand to me with
the ferocious Lucius Vorenus at my side?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.205
Clever.

18:46.334 --> 18:51.545
All these years together and it still
surprises you I can tie my sandals.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.627
Sleep sound, little man.

19:08.440 --> 19:13.150
Your mother and l have been thinking
about finding you that husband.

19:14.904 --> 19:18.772
A senator's daughter cannot be running
around unattached.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.569
There's no hurry.

19:20.702 --> 19:25.662
Don't worry, we'll find you a good rich old man
you can wrap round your little finger.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.576
Beauty like you can have your pick.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.200
I told you, I don't want a rich old man.

19:30.337 --> 19:35.923
Of course you do. Just think of all those fine
dresses and jewels and slaves you'll have.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.667
I don't care about such trivial things.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.385
Trivial?

19:41.514 --> 19:45.553
When I was your age,
I had to eat bones from the gutter.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.516
Dresses and jewels are not trivial.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.261
They show others your people
are rich and powerful

19:50.398 --> 19:55.438
and that you are loved
and protected and valued.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.232
But I want to marry someone I love.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.282
Love doesn't come unbidden,
you have to work for her.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.402
Strange marriage
if you loved him from the start.

20:05.538 --> 20:11.829
Right. It takes a while. Now, you be
a good virtuous wife and love will come.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.873
Your mother and l,
we had our troubles, didn't we?

20:18.635 --> 20:20.421
lsuppose.

20:20.553 --> 20:25.889
So...a good rich old man it is, then.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.660
l was about to wake you.

20:47.789 --> 20:51.077
Wherever you were,
you were not enjoying yourself.

20:52.085 --> 20:57.330
- It was another dream of omens.
— You're becoming quite the oracle.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.421
Shall I send for some willow water?

20:59.551 --> 21:02.759
- You'll sleep better.
— l was in the country.

21:02.887 --> 21:06.846
Please, I have had such dreams for years.

21:06.975 --> 21:11.639
Bloody rain, black dogs,
hooded ferrymen...for years.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.978
Here I am, still alive and well.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.849
I've never had such dreams before now.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.937
What am | to do?

21:22.949 --> 21:26.988
Should I quit Rome and hide
because you have bad dreams?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.736
Why not?

21:29.873 --> 21:31.955
I'm serious.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.455
Are you not weary of this toil?

21:39.591 --> 21:42.879
I am. I am extremely weary.

21:44.596 --> 21:49.841
But there is much more to be done,
I'm afraid. Much more.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.388
There's always more to be done.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.479
To what end?

21:59.527 --> 22:02.269
- What end?
— Good question.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.068
I shall ask Posca.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.741
Go to sleep, my dear.

22:17.170 --> 22:23.791
Ancestors of the Junii, we ask for
your blessing on this man of your blood.

22:28.723 --> 22:31.180
Let his arm be strong.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.018
Let his aim be true.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.311
Let his heart be filled with sacred rage.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.961
Good boy.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.876
Hello.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.175
Hello.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.228
Hey, Venus, l have a question for you.

24:06.154 --> 24:08.440
Guess who I am.

24:29.594 --> 24:33.553
Thanks very much. It was nice to meet you.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.763
I can manage from here.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.660
Wait.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.993
So, where is everybody?

25:28.945 --> 25:32.403
I'm sure I saw that one
selling fish in the Forum.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.614
At least he's Roman.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.119
A good Roman fishmonger is a fine nobleman

25:37.245 --> 25:41.204
compared to some of these Belgians
and Celts that call themselves chiefs.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.823
There's one over there with earrings.

25:50.842 --> 25:52.582
It's good to see you.

25:52.719 --> 25:56.257
It's the end, eh? The Gauls have invaded.

25:57.932 --> 26:02.892
Well, don't be so glum. They will return
to their ghastly mountain hovels soon enough.

26:03.020 --> 26:07.605
Caesar will only summon them back when
he needs their support for a fresh outrage.

26:07.734 --> 26:11.647
The red man shadowing Caesar is
the famous Lucius Vorenus, one assumes.

26:11.779 --> 26:15.192
—|ndeed.
— Affectionate, aren't they?

26:15.324 --> 26:17.155
Might be father and son.

26:17.285 --> 26:20.493
Caesar would have
the humble people think so.

26:20.621 --> 26:24.034
He keeps the wretched man
by his side constantly.

26:24.167 --> 26:27.659
This beast of the fields is a senator of Rome!

26:27.795 --> 26:30.912
Do not fret so, Casca.

26:31.048 --> 26:37.009
We timid subjects of King Caesar
must learn to be tolerant.

26:37.138 --> 26:41.598
I believe I shall go home
and stupefy myself with wine.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.682
Good day to you all.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.772
Old fool.

27:10.087 --> 27:13.295
He knows, I'm sure of it. He knows.
You saw how he looked at us.

27:13.424 --> 27:15.460
Be calm. If he knew, we'd be dead already.

27:15.593 --> 27:18.801
He's playing the blind man,
waiting for us to betray ourselves.

27:18.930 --> 27:22.843
He's not worried about us!
He thinks we are cowards.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.966
Well, in any case, we must act soon.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.684
Today he brings in Gauls
and Celts and low plebs.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.851
Tomorrow it'll be Belgians
or freedmen, and he won't rest

27:30.983 --> 27:34.271
until he's turned the Senate
into a bawdy house!

27:35.696 --> 27:39.530
We good noblemen will be
outnumbered by foreign rabble.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.696
We will be degraded, powerless.

27:42.829 --> 27:46.037
— We must act soon.
— What about bloody Lucius Vorenus?

27:46.165 --> 27:49.953
— Lucius Vorenus is a son of a whore.
- You know him personally, it seems.

27:50.086 --> 27:53.328
I know him. I know him.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.551
Who is Lucius Vorenus?

27:57.677 --> 28:02.888
You remember the low soldier that jumped
into the arena to save a comrade?

28:03.015 --> 28:04.425
I remember something.

28:04.559 --> 28:08.518
Well, Caesar's pandered to the mob
and made him a senator.

28:08.646 --> 28:13.015
And when Caesar's in the Senate,
the dog never leaves his master's side.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.277
And a fearsome dog it is.

28:15.403 --> 28:20.898
So, if we are to reckon with Caesar
on the Senate floor,

28:21.033 --> 28:23.945
we must reckon with Lucius Vorenus also.

28:24.078 --> 28:26.660
Kill him as well. What's it matter?

28:26.789 --> 28:30.077
— He is a popular man.
- So? I'll kill him.

28:30.209 --> 28:34.077
It is most important
that we keep the people on our side.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.169
We cannot kill one of their heroes.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.881
That would sully the whole business.

28:39.010 --> 28:42.719
— Only the tyrant dies.
— Kill Caesar in his bed then.

28:42.847 --> 28:45.964
— He doesn't sleep with this man, does he?
- Quintus.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.056
It's not such a bad thought.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.892
We could bribe some of his slaves.

28:51.022 --> 28:54.230
Buy off his cook.
Buy off his taster. Poison him.

28:54.358 --> 28:57.771
Gentlemen, this is not some cheap murder!

29:01.699 --> 29:08.116
It is an honourable thing that we do
and it must be done honourably.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.908
ln daylight.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.202
On the Senate floor.

29:12.335 --> 29:14.246
With our own hand.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.297
With my hand.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.629
You're right, of course.

29:27.934 --> 29:33.930
— Forgive me.
— That's all very well, but how?

29:34.941 --> 29:36.431
How?

29:54.627 --> 29:57.369
What's wrong?

29:59.507 --> 30:01.589
Still awake?

30:03.302 --> 30:06.089
You are worrying very loudly.

30:14.271 --> 30:18.935
| feel like everything
seems to be moving so fast.

30:19.068 --> 30:21.309
It feels like...

30:26.075 --> 30:29.659
I'm scared sometimes.

31:13.247 --> 31:17.115
— Lucius Vorenus, was that his name?
- What?

31:17.251 --> 31:20.914
The low soldier that Caesar made a senator.
Was that his name?

31:21.047 --> 31:23.789
Lucius Vorenus. Why?

31:23.924 --> 31:26.210
l have heard the name before.

31:28.054 --> 31:32.798
"My dear friend, I regret I have not seen
you or yours for some time.

31:32.933 --> 31:37.142
"Two families as entwined as ours
must not be strangers.

31:37.271 --> 31:40.889
"Would it be convenient for you
to come and visit me tomorrow?

31:41.025 --> 31:44.893
"With great affection, Servilia."

31:45.029 --> 31:48.112
— How strange.
— Is it?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.617
Why would she want to see me?
She hates me.

31:50.743 --> 31:54.281
So do |. That's no bar to friendship.

31:55.164 --> 31:58.452
- What is she thinking?
— Nothing to your benefit.

31:59.710 --> 32:02.918
— What will you do?
— I shall accept, of course.

32:03.047 --> 32:07.211
- Is that wise?
— Probably not. Her rage amuses me.

32:07.343 --> 32:09.834
You shall come with me.

32:09.970 --> 32:13.178
- Why?
— To be my protector, of course.

32:13.307 --> 32:15.514
Who knows what the mad old turtle will do?

32:15.643 --> 32:19.852
— Please don't speak of her so.
— Well, she is a mad old turtle.

32:19.980 --> 32:23.313
Anyway, I thought you were above
such petty emotions nowadays.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.400
I am. I try to be.

32:28.531 --> 32:31.989
You still have feelings for her.
There's nothing wrong with that.

32:32.118 --> 32:36.703
| feel nothing but pity for her.
And for myself as l was then.

32:36.831 --> 32:38.446
And for you.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.789
Me?

32:40.918 --> 32:42.749
You silly goose.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.506
Why are you dressed so?

32:56.642 --> 33:02.683
I'm going to the country. Just for the day,
to get some fresh air, stretch my legs.

33:03.774 --> 33:07.608
l was thinking of stopping
by the shrine of sacred Rusina,

33:07.736 --> 33:11.945
asking her if she'll forgive me
for all the bad things I've done.

33:12.074 --> 33:17.068
You think she might...forgive me?

33:17.997 --> 33:19.828
Who knows what the gods will do?

33:24.670 --> 33:27.332
Come along, if you like.

33:28.382 --> 33:33.342
Senate in session today.
No assemblies in the vicinity.

33:33.470 --> 33:36.052
No gaming. No prostitution.

33:36.182 --> 33:42.018
May all the gods bless our sacrosanct father,
Gaius Julius Caesar.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.068
— Good day, Senator.
— Good day.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.734
Sir, sir, a moment of your time!

33:53.866 --> 33:55.276
Read my petition!

33:55.409 --> 33:58.446
Caesar! Caesar!

33:58.579 --> 34:02.788
My dear Atia, how wonderful to see you.

34:02.917 --> 34:04.498
Wonderful indeed.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.709
And Octavian!

34:07.796 --> 34:11.004
— You're practically a man!
— I like to think so.

34:11.133 --> 34:15.752
And so handsome. Come in, come in.

34:15.888 --> 34:19.597
It's looking lovely here.
Have you redecorated?

34:55.427 --> 34:56.883
Pull!

35:26.542 --> 35:30.785
Senator Vorenus,
I come about your grandson Lucius.

35:34.133 --> 35:38.467
..Servilia of the Junii,
and what I tell you now is the truth.

35:49.982 --> 35:56.103
— You're alive!
— Answer me, what child is that?

36:12.338 --> 36:15.205
- Where is Vorenus?
— He was with us a moment ago.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.922
Never mind.

36:17.051 --> 36:19.793
Mark Antony,
why don't you give us a moment?

36:22.139 --> 36:24.505
You must be wondering
why I invited you here.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.132
I am rather puzzled.

36:27.269 --> 36:32.980
Well, it's important to me that I be
the first to tell you what has happened.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.230
Why? What has happened?

36:37.363 --> 36:38.978
- Trebonius.
— Great Caesar.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.571
I know, Barca, I know. I have not forgotten.

36:41.700 --> 36:46.911
If I may, gracious Caesar, you were going
to consider revoking my brother's exile.

36:47.039 --> 36:49.405
I'm still considering it.

36:50.459 --> 36:52.575
Take your hand off me.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.384
What are you waiting for? Now! Now!

37:27.204 --> 37:29.240
- Wait!
— Get off me!

38:23.886 --> 38:26.127
Do it.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.336
Stop it!

39:43.465 --> 39:45.547
What's wrong?

39:48.971 --> 39:51.337
— Where is he?
- Who?

39:51.473 --> 39:53.589
Your son!

40:01.108 --> 40:03.269
Tell me it's not true.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.358
Tell me! Tell me!

40:18.500 --> 40:20.582
I thought you were dead.

41:11.094 --> 41:15.053
Lucius, the boy is blameless.

41:35.494 --> 41:38.782
Thus ever for tyrants.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.724
No!

42:47.649 --> 42:53.736
So you see, the tyrant is dead,
the Republic is restored and you are alone.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.944
Would you like some honey water?

43:01.455 --> 43:04.367
I won't, thank you.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.707
Please don't be afraid. I won't harm you.

43:07.836 --> 43:10.452
— Not yet.
- Harm?

43:10.589 --> 43:15.208
Why would you wish us harm?
We've always been great friends.

43:15.343 --> 43:18.631
— Politics is for the men, | always...
— Not yet.

43:18.764 --> 43:21.722
I will make you suffer slowly.

43:21.850 --> 43:25.934
Slowly and deeply, as you made me suffer.

43:26.062 --> 43:30.101
First, I want to see you run, run for your life.

43:31.109 --> 43:37.150
Run to some rat hole in Greece or lllyria,
wherever you like.

43:39.034 --> 43:41.946
I shall come and find you.

43:50.796 --> 43:52.912
Thank you for the visit.
