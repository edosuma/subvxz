02:36.280 --> 02:38.556
Billy, do you know
how many girls
there are out there?

02:38.760 --> 02:40.274
They're all over the place.

Billy, let me tell you a story.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.550
During the war,
this guy Herbie and I
became friends.

03:04.760 --> 03:08.993
Well, Herbie fell in love
with a wonderful
Italian girl, Carla.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.557
Thinking of Carla
was what got him
through the war.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.912
Well, Carla died,
and Herbie
nearly fell apart.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.032
He stayed in, drank.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.118
I've never seen anyone
so miserable.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.279
And then one day
Herbie came to me
and he said:

03:23.480 --> 03:26.473
"Chet, life must go on."

03:26.680 --> 03:28.831
And Herbie went on.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.874
A few years later,
he fell in love
with another woman,

03:32.080 --> 03:35.039
married her, and
they went to Jamaica
on their honeymoon,

03:35.240 --> 03:38.631
and she ran off with
a steel band.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.631
But Herbie went on.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.719
He married again,
and this time,
at the wedding reception,

03:44.920 --> 03:48.197
his bride left him
for the caterer.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.790
But still, Herbie went on.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.549
His next wife
ran off with his partner,

03:55.760 --> 04:00.596
who ran off with his business.
But still, Herbie went on.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.359
Because you see, Billy,

04:02.560 --> 04:04.916
he knew that there's
a whole world out there.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.954
He knew that somewhere,
around some corner,

04:08.160 --> 04:10.117
he would find happiness.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.237
Wow. I feel like a jerk.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.113
I mean, look at Herbie,
a lifetime of disasters.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.599
I had a week with
a 13-year-old shrimp who lisps

04:20.800 --> 04:22.439
and I'm gonna throw my life away?

04:22.640 --> 04:23.640
Thanks, Dad.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.757
Good boy.
I'll see you at breakfast.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.156
Hey, Dad, where's Herbie now?

04:28.360 --> 04:32.274
Oh, he's, uh,
in a mental institution.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.476
What?

04:35.680 --> 04:37.831
Yes. He just sits in a corner,

04:38.040 --> 04:41.431
talks in numbers
and makes lovely baskets.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.757
But...

04:43.960 --> 04:45.076

I don't know why
he gave me

14:28.680 --> 14:30.000
I never said I wanted one.

all the food turned to mush...

Chester gave me
this tennis racket

ungrateful, Mary.

14:57.520 --> 14:58.954

I took tennis lessons,
I met Peter.
