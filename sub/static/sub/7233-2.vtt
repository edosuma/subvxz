Tommy Brock will be so

No worms, no deal!

10:02.400 --> 10:03.100
Hey!

10:03.100 --> 10:04.630
Hey, hey, hey.

10:04.630 --> 10:06.350
I've got an idea.

10:06.350 --> 10:08.670
Why don't we all go
home, sleep on it,

10:08.670 --> 10:10.270
and then we can
cook me tomorrow?

10:10.270 --> 10:11.050
Agreed?

10:11.050 --> 10:11.770
Agreed.

10:11.770 --> 10:12.930
Agreed.

10:12.930 --> 10:13.630
What?

10:13.630 --> 10:15.090
What?

10:15.090 --> 10:17.370
Think I'm dumb do you, rabbit?

10:17.370 --> 10:19.950
Oh, well.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.720
Dinner time!

10:21.720 --> 10:24.550
You don't really
want to eat me, do you?

10:24.550 --> 10:27.210
Young rabbits are
very chewy, you know?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.000
Oh!

10:28.000 --> 10:28.700
Oh.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.610
Oh.
Oh.

[FOOTSTEPS]

10:30.380 --> 10:31.080
What's that?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.930
I know that sound anywhere.

10:35.930 --> 10:36.630
It's--

10:39.440 --> 10:42.180
[GASP] Mr. McGregor!

10:42.180 --> 10:43.010
Run!

10:43.010 --> 10:44.620
Don't believe it.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.880
It's just another one
of your tricks, eh?

10:46.880 --> 10:50.440
BENJAMIN: If there's one thing
I hate more than rabbits,

10:50.440 --> 10:52.720
it's smelly, badger like you!

11:02.620 --> 11:05.590
[LAUGHS] Not bad, huh?

11:05.590 --> 11:07.080
Whew!

11:07.080 --> 11:10.110
If there's one thing I
hate more than rabbits,

11:10.110 --> 11:12.600
it's smelly badgers like you!

11:12.600 --> 11:13.730
[LAUGHTER]

11:13.730 --> 11:16.740
I never thought I'd
be so happy to see

11:16.740 --> 11:18.400
Mr. McGregor's boots.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.830
[LAUGHTER]

11:22.770 --> 11:25.920
Just like I told you,
that's the food chain.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.410
Big things chase little things.

11:28.410 --> 11:29.660
Always the way.

11:29.660 --> 11:30.360
BENJAMIN: Help!

11:30.360 --> 11:31.980
It's after me!
