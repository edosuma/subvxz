- <i>Tell you what.</i>

22:21.200 --> 22:23.200
<i>They're planning on heading back
tomorrow morning anyway.</i>

22:23.202 --> 22:24.902
<i>Once they get reception,</i>

22:24.904 --> 22:26.670
<i>I will let Isaac know
to have Margot give you a call.</i>

22:26.672 --> 22:28.739
Perfect. That is perfect.
Thank you.

22:28.741 --> 22:30.406
- <i>Is everything okay with you two?</i>
- Thank you so...

22:30.408 --> 22:32.209
- What do you mean?
- <i>Well, I...</i>

22:32.211 --> 22:34.745
<i>I just haven't spoken to you
since Pam's...</i>

22:34.747 --> 22:36.881
Oh. Oh. Thank you.

22:36.883 --> 22:39.819
Everything is great.
Margot and I are great.

23:20.092 --> 23:22.228
[ringing]

23:27.400 --> 23:31.567
- [David] Hello?
- <i>Hey. Mr. Kim? This is Isaac. My mom told me to...</i>

23:31.569 --> 23:35.605
- Isaac! Yes, hi. Sorry to have you call me so early.
- <i>It's okay.</i>

23:35.607 --> 23:37.442
<i>Just wanted to say I'm sorry
I couldn't be of more help.</i>

23:37.909 --> 23:40.612
Yeah. Can you put my daughter
on the phone, please?

23:42.281 --> 23:43.448
<i>Did my mom not tell you?</i>

23:44.383 --> 23:45.418
What... What do you mean?

23:47.253 --> 23:48.987
<i>She never came.</i>

23:50.289 --> 23:51.456
What? What are you...

23:52.090 --> 23:54.023
- Isaac, what do you mean?
- <i>I mean she never came.</i>

23:54.025 --> 23:56.459
<i>I even reached out to her
after school on Friday</i>

23:56.461 --> 23:58.630
<i>when we were all heading out and
my car still had an extra seat.</i>

23:59.198 --> 24:00.065
What did she say?

24:02.901 --> 24:04.903
<i>She... didn't respond.</i>

24:09.442 --> 24:11.140
[line ringing]

24:11.142 --> 24:12.644
[man] <i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

24:13.144 --> 24:14.978
[David] <i>Hi. I'm calling
about a possible...</i>

24:14.980 --> 24:17.515
<i>I'm calling to report
a missing person.</i>

24:17.816 --> 24:20.417
- [man] <i>Okay, who is this regarding?</i>
<i>- Uh, my daughter.</i>

24:20.419 --> 24:22.353
<i>I know I should've called sooner.
I just thought that...</i>

24:22.355 --> 24:24.187
- [man] <i>That's okay, sir.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

24:24.189 --> 24:26.689
[man] <i>The first thing
we need to do is file a report.</i>

24:26.691 --> 24:29.694
<i>After that, I'll put out a call to a detective
in the area who will be in touch with you.</i>

24:30.195 --> 24:32.862
- [David] <i>All right.</i>
- [man] <i>Now, let's start with her name.</i>

24:32.864 --> 24:37.168
[David]
<i>Margot Kim. M-A-R-G-O-T.</i>

24:37.502 --> 24:38.837
<i>Kim. K-I-M.</i>

24:43.975 --> 24:45.710
[ringing]

24:46.778 --> 24:48.978
- Hello?
- [woman] <i>Hi. Is this David Kim?</i>

24:48.980 --> 24:51.482
Yes, this is David Kim.
I'm assuming this is...

24:51.484 --> 24:54.183
<i>Good morning, Mr. Kim.
My name is Rosemary Vick.</i>

24:54.185 --> 24:56.919
<i>I'm the detective sergeant
assigned to your daughter's case.</i>

24:56.921 --> 24:58.955
Yeah. Good morning.
I've been waiting for your call.

24:58.957 --> 25:00.925
<i>Of course.
We're working as fast as we can.</i>

25:01.526 --> 25:04.193
<i>I'm currently 35 minutes away
from your house.</i>

25:04.195 --> 25:07.699
<i>But while I have you, do you feel
comfortable telling me what you know?</i>

25:08.099 --> 25:09.832
I just told every detail I know

25:09.834 --> 25:12.035
to whoever I got off
the phone with an hour ago.

25:12.037 --> 25:14.137
- I don't know what you guys are doing.
- <i>I promise you, Mr. Kim,</i>

25:14.139 --> 25:16.706
<i>we are taking this
very seriously.</i>

25:16.708 --> 25:20.111
<i>And as a parent myself, I can only
imagine what you must be feeling.</i>

25:20.478 --> 25:23.948
<i>But for me to help you, I do need
to know how everything unfolded,</i>

25:24.249 --> 25:25.350
<i>from your eyes.</i>

25:26.518 --> 25:27.385
Understood...

25:28.652 --> 25:29.553
Detective.

25:34.059 --> 25:36.261
<i>Okay, let's see
if I got this right.</i>

25:37.762 --> 25:40.229
<i>One: after
a group study session,</i>

25:40.231 --> 25:43.501
<i>Margot, with her car, didn't
return home Thursday evening.</i>

25:45.870 --> 25:49.074
<i>Two: she called three times
at 11:00 p.m.</i>

25:51.509 --> 25:54.245
<i>Three: she didn't attend school
on Friday.</i>

25:55.746 --> 25:59.716
<i>And four: she's been skipping piano
classes for the last six months.</i>

26:00.351 --> 26:02.418
- <i>Was all of that correct?</i>
- Yes.

26:02.420 --> 26:06.191
<i>Okay. Mr. Kim, I am going to find
out what happened to your daughter.</i>

26:06.657 --> 26:09.058
<i>But I'll need to know
a lot more about her, okay?</i>

26:09.060 --> 26:11.360
Yes, yes.
What do you want me to do?

26:11.362 --> 26:13.795
[stammers] I'll go talk
to neighbors. I'll...

26:13.797 --> 26:17.033
<i>We'll handle the ground investigation,
Mr. Kim. That's our job.</i>

26:17.035 --> 26:18.967
<i>But if there's something
a parent can do,</i>

26:18.969 --> 26:21.839
<i>it's shedding light for us
on who your daughter is</i>

26:22.407 --> 26:23.841
<i>and the people she talks to.</i>

26:28.879 --> 26:30.614
<i>Is that something
you can help us with?</i>

26:32.383 --> 26:33.251
Yes.

26:36.121 --> 26:37.322
I can help with that.

28:46.116 --> 28:50.487
[Vick] <i>Okay. It's already been 36
hours since Margot's last call,</i>

28:50.988 --> 28:52.422
<i>so we've got to move
a little quickly.</i>

28:56.059 --> 28:58.928
<i>We'll be taking a copy of
Margot's hard drive to Forensics.</i>

29:00.063 --> 29:00.930
<i>But in the meantime...</i>

29:02.165 --> 29:04.301
<i>any information
you can give me about her</i>

29:04.701 --> 29:07.271
<i>or the people
around her will help.</i>

29:09.072 --> 29:11.573
- [ringing]
- [Jonah] <i>Wait, you can't find Margot?</i>

29:11.575 --> 29:14.743
[David] No, I can't. Do you mind
answering some questions for me to help?

29:14.745 --> 29:17.845
- [Jonah] Yeah, sure.
- Okay, when was the last time you saw her?

29:17.847 --> 29:20.450
Um... Tuesday.
Her locker's near me.

29:20.916 --> 29:22.651
[David]
All right, on Thursday evening,

29:22.653 --> 29:24.586
she attended a study group
for her biology class.

29:24.588 --> 29:27.289
- Do you know anything about that?
- She's probably in AP Bio, right?

29:27.291 --> 29:30.160
- Yes. She is.
- Yeah, no, I'm in regular.

29:31.093 --> 29:32.494
What were you doing
Thursday night?

29:32.496 --> 29:36.231
Thursday night,
I was at my dad's house.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.300
Yeah, he picked me up
after finals that day.

29:38.302 --> 29:39.969
All right.
Thank you, Jonah.

29:40.437 --> 29:41.935
[end call beeps]

29:41.937 --> 29:43.707
How does, uh...
how does this look?

29:48.110 --> 29:52.614
Perfect. Hey, update me whenever
you learn something. Big or small.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.482
Okay.
Where are you going?

29:54.484 --> 29:56.353
To find out what the rest
of her Thursday looked like.

29:57.321 --> 29:58.187
Oh. Oh.

29:58.722 --> 29:59.855
And share that with me, too.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.193
[camera shutter clicking]

30:09.332 --> 30:10.600
[David]
<i>And what about Thursday night?</i>

30:10.833 --> 30:12.734
[Cate] <i>Thursday night,</i>

30:12.736 --> 30:14.736
<i>I was finishing up
my final paper for English.</i>

30:14.738 --> 30:17.541
[Gordy] <i>I don't know.
Xbox, dinner, some Netflix?</i>

30:17.808 --> 30:19.607
[Scott]
<i>I just finished my last final,</i>

30:19.609 --> 30:21.911
<i>which means I was
at Carmen's house playing pong.</i>

<i>Ping... Ping-pong.</i>

30:24.447 --> 30:25.314
[chime]

30:29.385 --> 30:31.686
[David] <i>What about study group?
Do you know who hosted that?</i>

30:31.688 --> 30:34.021
- [boy 1] <i>I took bio last year, so no.</i>
- [girl 1] <i>No idea.</i>

30:34.023 --> 30:35.523
[Isaac] She and I
are on different AP paths,

30:35.525 --> 30:36.857
so it was
kind of hard to keep tabs.

30:36.859 --> 30:38.160
[David]
But you guys are friends.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.628
Kind of.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.062
What are you talking about?

30:42.064 --> 30:43.265
You invited her
on a camping trip.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.200
Well, yeah.
I mean, you know my mom.

30:46.202 --> 30:47.169
Yes. So?

30:48.404 --> 30:50.239
She was really good friends
with Margot's mom.

30:50.741 --> 30:51.842
Okay, so?

30:53.342 --> 30:54.310
She felt bad...

30:55.044 --> 30:57.246
about everything
that happened to you guys.

30:59.115 --> 31:00.817
But she has friends, right?

31:01.650 --> 31:04.685
- [boy 2] <i>Define "friends."</i>
- [David] <i>Do people invite her to things?</i>

31:04.687 --> 31:06.887
[boy 3] <i>I think people
occasionally invite her to things.</i>

31:06.889 --> 31:09.323
- [girl 2] <i>She just never comes.</i>
- [boy 4] <i>She keeps to herself a lot.</i>

31:09.325 --> 31:11.892
- [girl 3] <i>She's quiet.</i>
- [boy 5] <i>I did see her eat lunch alone.</i>

31:11.894 --> 31:12.763
[David] <i>On Thursday?</i>

31:14.230 --> 31:15.231
[boy 5] <i>Every day.</i>

31:17.967 --> 31:19.133
[chime]

31:19.135 --> 31:21.001
[Peter] David, look,

31:21.003 --> 31:22.804
I know you don't want
to hear this from me right now,

31:22.806 --> 31:24.505
but you got to take it easy.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.573
I can help with everything
that you're looking through.

31:26.575 --> 31:29.076
Are there any Facebook friends
you haven't talked to yet?

31:29.078 --> 31:31.147
Yes. Ninety-four.

31:31.914 --> 31:34.281
And, apparently, since nobody
was actually her friend,

31:34.283 --> 31:36.719
I don't know who to talk to without
calling every name I read online.

31:39.455 --> 31:40.489
What about offline?

32:04.280 --> 32:07.214
- [Abigail] <i>Yeah, that was at my place.</i>
- [David] <i>That was your place?</i>

32:07.216 --> 32:10.784
<i>- You hosted the study group on Thursday night for bio?</i>
- [Abigail] <i>Yeah.</i>

32:10.786 --> 32:13.187
[David] <i>So you were with Margot for
the majority of the night. Did you...</i>

32:13.189 --> 32:14.890
[Abigail] <i>Well, the study group
only went till 9:00.</i>

32:15.558 --> 32:17.259
[David] <i>No, no.
She said it was going all night.</i>

32:17.927 --> 32:19.595
No, she definitely left at 9:00.

32:19.895 --> 32:20.830
Maybe even earlier.

32:23.299 --> 32:24.733
Did she say
where she was going?

32:25.534 --> 32:27.568
- Not really.
- How'd she look?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.470
Was she worried? Did she look scared?
Was she talking?

32:29.472 --> 32:32.171
Honestly, I don't know.
We're not really that close.

32:32.173 --> 32:33.809
Well, then why did you
invite her to study group?

32:36.645 --> 32:38.112
I'm trying to get into Berkeley
next year.

32:40.316 --> 32:41.317
Okay, you were...

32:41.951 --> 32:43.517
You were in her class, though.

32:43.519 --> 32:46.353
Did she mention anything unusual
going on lately?

32:46.355 --> 32:48.691
- Was she acting strange?
- [clicks tongue] Uh...

32:49.859 --> 32:51.660
You know,
she did go on Tumblr a lot.

32:52.761 --> 32:53.896
What? What is a "tumbler"?

33:23.091 --> 33:23.959
[chime]

33:31.901 --> 33:33.368
[Vick]
First, she fills up her gas.

33:37.806 --> 33:39.507
Then exits off the 101.

33:42.443 --> 33:45.046
And then turns onto
the 152 East.

33:45.413 --> 33:46.715
10:02 p.m.

33:49.384 --> 33:51.185
[David] 152 East?

34:02.697 --> 34:03.933
That exit leads out of town.

34:04.632 --> 34:06.699
[Vick] She took it alone.

34:06.701 --> 34:09.201
[David] That doesn't make sense. This
does not sound like my daughter.

34:09.203 --> 34:10.837
She's acting like
a totally different person.

34:10.839 --> 34:12.739
Okay, hold on, hold on.
You just gave me an idea.

34:14.475 --> 34:16.877
In the meantime,
start expanding

34:16.879 --> 34:18.914
from only the people
she communicated with.

34:19.581 --> 34:21.416
Look into her behavior also.

34:57.885 --> 34:59.821
- [David] Oh, my God.
- [Peter] What?

35:00.221 --> 35:04.423
[David] She's been depositing her piano
cash into her checking account every week.

35:04.425 --> 35:05.994
[Peter] The hell was she doing
with all that money?

35:09.430 --> 35:13.334
[David] Six days ago, she made an
outgoing transaction of $2,500

35:13.935 --> 35:15.103
to "Venmo."

35:16.237 --> 35:17.472
[Peter] The payment service?

35:20.074 --> 35:22.175
[David] There it is. $2,500.

35:22.810 --> 35:23.778
Six days ago.

35:24.312 --> 35:25.711
[Peter]
Does it say what it was for?

35:25.713 --> 35:27.313
[David]
Nothing but a peace sign.

35:27.315 --> 35:28.349
[Peter] Who did she send it to?

35:34.322 --> 35:35.488
[David] Doesn't say.

35:35.490 --> 35:37.358
Okay. That's weird.

35:38.126 --> 35:39.060
That's really weird.

35:41.194 --> 35:44.499
You don't think she's involved
with anything serious, right?

35:46.768 --> 35:47.867
Davy.

35:47.869 --> 35:49.202
I don't know. I got to go.

37:00.108 --> 37:01.841

37:01.843 --> 37:03.976
<i>Sir, I don't
have to tell you anything.</i>

37:03.978 --> 37:06.979
I just want to know where you were
the night my daughter went missing.

37:06.981 --> 37:09.848
<i>Like I said,
I had a prior engagement.</i>

37:09.850 --> 37:11.183
- What are you hiding?
- <i>I was busy.</i>

37:11.185 --> 37:12.584
- What are you hiding?
- <i>Nothing!</i>

37:12.586 --> 37:14.220
Then answer the damn question

37:14.222 --> 37:16.021
before there's a cop
knocking on your door.

37:16.023 --> 37:18.025
Where were you the night
my daughter went missing?

37:41.215 --> 37:42.749
[ringing]

37:45.153 --> 37:46.019
[sniffles]

37:47.721 --> 37:49.454
Hello?

37:49.456 --> 37:50.924
[Vick] <i>Does the name
Rachel Jeun ring a bell?</i>

37:55.495 --> 37:56.463
No. Why?

38:01.601 --> 38:03.635
- It's Margot.
- <i>You mentioned earlier</i>

38:03.637 --> 38:05.570
<i>she was acting like
a different person,</i>

38:05.572 --> 38:08.473
<i>so I had our Forensics team look
through any deleted contacts</i>

38:08.475 --> 38:09.976
<i>on the copy of her hard drive.</i>

38:10.977 --> 38:13.745
<i>One of those contacts was
a local forger.</i>

38:13.747 --> 38:16.316
<i>He said Margot picked up an ID
a few days ago,</i>

38:16.583 --> 38:19.252
<i>around the same time
she withdrew all that money.</i>

38:20.453 --> 38:21.321
"Withdrew"?

38:23.089 --> 38:24.823
What? Withdrew what money?

38:24.825 --> 38:27.360
<i>David, I also spoke
to security at Venmo</i>

38:27.761 --> 38:31.462
<i>to find out more about the account
Margot sent the $2,500 to.</i>

38:31.464 --> 38:32.799
Yeah. Do they know
who it belonged to?

38:33.433 --> 38:34.768
<i>It belonged to Margot.</i>

38:37.671 --> 38:38.538
She...

38:40.106 --> 38:41.675
She sent the money
to herself?

38:42.209 --> 38:44.374
What was she doing,
running a laundering scheme?

38:44.376 --> 38:45.645
<i>That's what it looks like.</i>

38:47.147 --> 38:49.113
<i>I'd see this a lot
in narcotics.</i>

38:49.115 --> 38:50.949
<i>People who know their money
is being watched</i>

38:50.951 --> 38:54.185
<i>just transfer their funds to
somewhere much less monitored.</i>

38:54.187 --> 38:55.255
"Less monitored." Like where?

38:57.456 --> 38:58.390
<i>The Internet.</i>

39:02.461 --> 39:03.330
[scoffs]

39:06.299 --> 39:08.867
She gets a fake ID,
she sends money to herself.

39:08.869 --> 39:09.803
What does this mean?

39:11.171 --> 39:13.874
<i>That it's time to start
considering the possibility...</i>

39:15.642 --> 39:17.143
<i>that Margot ran away.</i>

39:21.181 --> 39:22.115
Why would she do that?

39:22.816 --> 39:24.150
<i>That's what we don't know.</i>

39:25.318 --> 39:28.552
Why would she do that? She called me
three times in the middle of the night.

39:28.554 --> 39:29.854
Three times she called me. Why?

39:29.856 --> 39:31.789
<i>We are going to figure out why.</i>

39:31.791 --> 39:33.992
- <i>So what I want to look for now...</i>
- No, no, no.

39:33.994 --> 39:35.028
No, no, no.

39:35.962 --> 39:36.930
I know my daughter.

39:37.364 --> 39:38.629
She did not run away.

39:38.631 --> 39:39.498
[end call beeps]

40:31.951 --> 40:35.054
[person singing, indistinct]

40:37.957 --> 40:40.592
Ooh. This is a good angle.

40:41.294 --> 40:44.297
Also, to all my fans, I know this
vlog is a little late, but...

40:45.731 --> 40:48.934
Favorite concert in the last year?
Definitely Twenty One Pilots.

40:50.437 --> 40:52.104
Well, thank you
for the compliment, Lucy.

40:54.274 --> 40:57.509
Oh, this is a Fearless Core shirt.
Cost me, like, 40 bucks.

41:00.112 --> 41:00.980
Um...

41:01.480 --> 41:03.115
How... how would I be able
to see you?

41:06.752 --> 41:09.320
[chuckles] Well, you know what?
You guys, you keep commenting,

41:09.322 --> 41:10.622
but honestly if it's kind...

42:31.336 --> 42:32.204
[scoffs]

42:52.424 --> 42:53.292
Hold on.

42:54.926 --> 42:56.828
[keys jingle]

43:09.241 --> 43:10.142
It's Uxie.

43:11.410 --> 43:14.313
It can wipe out memories.
And it's kind of cute.

43:15.147 --> 43:16.781
How'd you know I like PokÃ©mon?

43:20.152 --> 43:21.487
A lot of people, actually.

43:22.121 --> 43:23.388
I mean,
ever since they started chang...

43:33.198 --> 43:34.500
This one I took at a lake.

43:37.735 --> 43:39.904
This one I took at a forest.

43:42.374 --> 43:43.242
That...

43:50.148 --> 43:51.115
I'm Margot.

43:54.952 --> 43:57.288
I'm 15. Almost 16.

44:00.958 --> 44:01.993
Student.

44:04.996 --> 44:06.030
San Jose.

44:09.000 --> 44:09.901
What's that like?

44:17.543 --> 44:19.578
Trust me,
it's probably better than this.

44:23.181 --> 44:24.480
This is it.

44:24.482 --> 44:26.448
- [frogs croaking]
- [birds chirping]

44:26.450 --> 44:28.286
Best place in the world
to do nothing.

44:33.958 --> 44:36.727
You work 25 hours
on top of school?

45:25.109 --> 45:27.678
My dad doesn't know
I stopped going to piano.

45:36.587 --> 45:37.622
He wouldn't get it.

45:43.394 --> 45:45.563
Anyway, don't you guys have...

45:57.874 --> 45:58.842
So...

45:59.809 --> 46:02.647
today is this mega babe's birthday.
[chuckles]

46:07.251 --> 46:08.352
Happy Birthday.

46:11.821 --> 46:15.459
You know,
if she were still here today,

46:15.892 --> 46:17.992
a hundred percent,
she'd be making us all her...

46:17.994 --> 46:19.162
- [knocking on door]
- [sniffles]

46:22.065 --> 46:22.932
[sniffles]

46:23.267 --> 46:24.167
Come in!

46:28.104 --> 46:29.407
Hey, sweetheart. Um...

46:32.909 --> 46:34.345
I... I...

46:35.879 --> 46:37.113
forgot to say earlier...

46:38.549 --> 46:39.417
Um...

46:44.287 --> 46:45.454
It's, uh...

46:45.456 --> 46:47.625
- Yeah, it's...
- Tuesday.

46:48.925 --> 46:50.260
So, <i>The Voice...</i>

46:50.561 --> 46:51.429
Um...

46:52.430 --> 46:53.464
Elimination round.

46:56.734 --> 46:58.132
[chuckles]
Yeah, of course.

46:58.134 --> 46:59.200
Still on?

46:59.202 --> 47:01.171
Yeah. Megan's gonna get cut.

47:02.305 --> 47:03.873
Yeah, she is.
I'll see you...

47:04.542 --> 47:06.009
- Bye.
- ...downstairs.

47:29.032 --> 47:30.801
[Vick] <i>I'm sorry, David.
It's another dead end.</i>

47:33.136 --> 47:34.839
You're sure you looked into
every one of them?

47:35.171 --> 47:38.707
Every one. None of the YouCast
users Margot interacted with

47:38.709 --> 47:40.508
have a connection
to her disappearance.

47:40.510 --> 47:42.178
- Even f...
- Even fish-n-chips.

47:42.780 --> 47:44.713
Using the information
on her account,

47:44.715 --> 47:47.281
we traced her
to a Kirchick's Diner,

47:47.283 --> 47:49.386
ten miles outside Pittsburgh.

47:49.820 --> 47:51.721
I spoke to her and her manager,

47:52.021 --> 47:55.425
who confirmed with CCTV
that she was on a shift.

47:56.693 --> 47:57.594
Checks out.

48:05.502 --> 48:06.469
I didn't know her.

48:09.840 --> 48:11.107
I didn't know my daughter.

48:12.909 --> 48:13.777
[clicks tongue]

48:20.750 --> 48:21.718
Couple years ago,

48:23.420 --> 48:25.321
an angry neighbor
starts banging on my door.

48:26.055 --> 48:27.889
When I asked her
what the trouble was,

48:27.891 --> 48:32.295
she said she wanted the $25
that my son had stolen from her.

48:33.029 --> 48:34.631
Now, I didn't know
what she was talking about.

48:35.432 --> 48:36.299
I know my son,

48:37.066 --> 48:39.135
and that did not sound like
the Robert I raised.

48:40.670 --> 48:43.239
But as it turned out,
it was true.

48:44.474 --> 48:50.111
My son had gone house-to-house in
the neighborhood for two weeks,

48:50.113 --> 48:52.315
telling people
that he was my son

48:53.216 --> 48:59.287
and that he was raising money
for a fictional police charity

48:59.289 --> 49:01.157
called "Moms and Dads in Blue."

49:01.758 --> 49:02.625
Hmm.

49:04.394 --> 49:05.462
Point is...

49:07.630 --> 49:09.432
you don't always know your kid.

49:12.335 --> 49:14.771
And that is never your fault.

49:18.575 --> 49:21.642
I have NCIC searching
for her vehicle in 16 states.

49:21.644 --> 49:24.077
Let's both try and catch up
on some sleep tonight.

49:24.079 --> 49:25.047
Talk in the a.m.

49:25.815 --> 49:26.816
What'd you do after?

49:28.818 --> 49:30.386
With your son,
once you found out?

49:33.423 --> 49:36.359
Um, I told my neighbor that...

49:37.326 --> 49:40.495
I had in fact
founded the charity,

49:40.497 --> 49:41.764
and I thanked her for the money.

49:44.467 --> 49:47.336
But I will deny it
if you ever bring that up.

49:47.804 --> 49:49.104
Okay. [chuckles]

49:52.609 --> 49:55.310
Look, I hope you know how thankful
I am that you were assigned to us.

49:57.847 --> 50:00.215
I just wish there wasn't
a case to be assigned to.

50:04.621 --> 50:05.454
All right.
Shutting down.

50:05.989 --> 50:06.856
- Yeah.
- Talk soon.

50:08.390 --> 50:09.424
[end call beeps]

50:55.671 --> 50:56.538
This is it.

51:00.009 --> 51:01.743
Best place in the world
to do nothing.

51:04.313 --> 51:05.180
This is it.

52:14.349 --> 52:15.350
[keys jingle]

52:16.585 --> 52:18.785
[line ringing]

52:18.787 --> 52:20.820
<i>You've reached Detective
Sergeant Rosemary Vick.</i>

52:20.822 --> 52:22.357
<i>Leave a message.
I'll get back to you.</i>

52:22.658 --> 52:23.959
[David panting] Vick, wake up!

52:24.526 --> 52:25.992
I know why
she was at that intersection.

52:25.994 --> 52:28.461
She wasn't leaving town.

52:28.463 --> 52:31.033
She was driving to the spot she's been
visiting for the past five months.

52:31.833 --> 52:34.870
It's 3:45 a.m.
I'm headed there now.

52:36.303 --> 52:39.007
- [line ringing]
- [David panting]

52:44.012 --> 52:44.880
Hey.

52:45.814 --> 52:46.682
Where are you?

52:48.617 --> 52:50.116
You told me she ran away, Vick.

52:50.118 --> 52:51.185
Are...

52:51.653 --> 52:52.621
Are you at the lake?

52:53.487 --> 52:56.522
You told me she ran away.

52:56.524 --> 52:57.993
Okay, I'm heading there
right now.

52:59.193 --> 53:01.562
Robert, honey,
just go back to sleep, okay?

53:02.097 --> 53:04.831
Okay. I need you
to stay calm, all right?

53:04.833 --> 53:06.400
We're gonna figure this out
together.

53:10.504 --> 53:11.505
What are you showing me?

53:13.574 --> 53:14.843
This is her key chain.

53:16.845 --> 53:17.713
Oh, my God.

53:19.014 --> 53:21.246
[sirens wailing]

53:21.248 --> 53:22.683
Did you call the cops?

53:24.152 --> 53:25.754
I'm heading... I'm on my way!

53:27.421 --> 53:29.290
You told me she ran away, Vick!

53:31.692 --> 53:33.325
[helicopter whirring]

53:33.327 --> 53:35.661
Good morning, Bay Area.
I'm Natalie Boyd.

53:35.663 --> 53:37.563
A terrifying development today

53:37.565 --> 53:40.900
as a vehicle matching that
of a missing San Jose teenager

53:40.902 --> 53:44.572
was discovered late last night
underneath a Santa Cruz lake.

53:45.207 --> 53:49.677
An operation is currently underway to
recover Margot Kim's Toyota Camry.

53:49.978 --> 53:52.311
But at this moment,
we still don't know

53:52.313 --> 53:55.850
whether the Evercreek High sophomore
is actually inside the vehicle.

54:13.601 --> 54:17.805
Okay, doesn't look like there's
anyone at the front seat.

54:18.806 --> 54:20.608
[helicopter whirring]

54:22.110 --> 54:24.643
And now it looks like they're...

54:24.645 --> 54:25.946
Okay,
they're checking the trunk.

54:42.563 --> 54:45.231
Good morning. Thank you for
being here on such short notice.

54:45.233 --> 54:47.399
I'm Detective Sergeant
Rosemary Vick,

54:47.401 --> 54:49.034
lead investigator on this case.

54:49.036 --> 54:52.306
I am joined by David Kim,
Margot's father.

54:53.107 --> 54:55.574
We've provided you all
with a timeline of events,

54:55.576 --> 54:58.410
starting with last Thursday,
May 11th,

54:58.412 --> 55:00.445
when Margot first went missing.

55:00.447 --> 55:01.682
That is yours to circulate.

55:02.616 --> 55:04.618
But focusing on the events
of this morning,

55:04.952 --> 55:06.819
the Silicon Valley
Police Department

55:06.821 --> 55:09.454
was able to recover
Miss Kim's vehicle.

55:09.456 --> 55:11.056
And to answer
the most pressing question,

55:11.058 --> 55:13.828
Margot Kim was not inside.

55:14.895 --> 55:18.630
However, our examination
of the vehicle did reveal

55:18.632 --> 55:20.132
a small amount of blood

55:20.134 --> 55:22.801
on the passenger-side dashboard,

55:22.803 --> 55:26.339
blood that points
to a physical altercation,

55:26.974 --> 55:29.340
meaning that this case is now

55:29.342 --> 55:32.079
officially being considered
an abduction.

55:32.980 --> 55:35.647
- [high-pitched tone]
- [male anchor] Good afternoon.

55:35.649 --> 55:38.482
A search through the Santa
Cruz forest is now underway

55:38.484 --> 55:41.954
for a local teen whose car
was found dumped in a lake.

55:41.956 --> 55:44.555
[female anchor] Authorities are
asking anyone with information

55:44.557 --> 55:47.558
to please call the hotline
or 911 immediately.

55:47.560 --> 55:49.628
[Vick] Starting at 1:00 p.m.,

55:49.630 --> 55:52.297
we'll be assigning every
volunteer to a search team.

55:52.299 --> 55:55.000
Each team is in charge
of a single section

55:55.002 --> 55:57.503
of the critical
12-square-mile radius.

55:58.172 --> 55:59.437
Because of the steep ravines

55:59.439 --> 56:01.439
and otherwise
unsafe topography

56:01.441 --> 56:03.108
on the west side of the lake,

56:03.110 --> 56:06.213
we have already cleared
the following zones.

56:07.014 --> 56:09.817
But still, there's a lot
of ground to cover.

56:12.552 --> 56:14.385
- Margot!
- Margot!

56:14.387 --> 56:17.289
- Margot!
- Margot!

56:17.291 --> 56:18.658
[shouting continues]

56:20.693 --> 56:23.394
[female reporter] It's been four
days since Margot Kim was last seen,

56:23.396 --> 56:25.696
and so far,
nothing to show for it

56:25.698 --> 56:28.568
except for the torturous mystery
at its center.

56:30.037 --> 56:35.107
[male anchor 2] $2,500 in cash
was found in a manila envelope

56:35.109 --> 56:36.643
on Margot's passenger seat.

56:37.710 --> 56:39.177
Was it a runaway fund,

56:39.179 --> 56:40.981
like the lead detective is
suggesting,

56:41.814 --> 56:43.050
or was it something more?

56:45.052 --> 56:48.821
[David] We covered about, um,
half the search zone already,

56:49.689 --> 56:52.792
and, um, tomorrow is a full day.

56:53.260 --> 56:56.462
And the more people came,
the faster it went.

56:57.264 --> 56:58.098
Um...

56:58.531 --> 56:59.366
Can I?

57:00.367 --> 57:02.136
So, if you have
some time tomorrow,

57:02.769 --> 57:05.538
we would... love the help.

57:07.707 --> 57:09.642
[thunder rumbling]

57:13.046 --> 57:15.846
[Vick] This is obviously not
the outcome we wanted,

57:15.848 --> 57:17.715
but we will resume the search

57:17.717 --> 57:20.421
the moment it is safe to
walk through the forest again.

57:21.288 --> 57:23.155
In the meantime, however,

57:23.157 --> 57:25.758
the investigation will not stop

57:26.626 --> 57:28.195
until we find Margot.

57:41.442 --> 57:43.342
I mean, listen,

57:43.344 --> 57:45.645
I do not think it is my place
to say anything. I just...

57:45.979 --> 57:49.383
I feel that these problems
usually start in the household.

58:06.065 --> 58:06.933
[Abigail] <i>She was...</i>

58:07.333 --> 58:08.267
[crying] I'm sorry.

58:08.469 --> 58:09.470
[sighing, sniffling]

58:12.473 --> 58:13.873
She was my best friend.

58:20.980 --> 58:23.483
I'm just a big believer
in community service.

58:23.816 --> 58:25.816
Looking at all the things
that happened to Margot,

58:25.818 --> 58:27.284
I just thought to myself,

58:27.286 --> 58:29.088
"I think they could use
my help."

59:16.903 --> 59:18.871
[indistinct chatter]

59:23.910 --> 59:26.512
Don't lie to me.
Don't lie to me.

59:26.812 --> 59:29.115
[Vick] You can't assist
in the investigation anymore.

59:31.117 --> 59:33.119
[David] What? What does that...
What does that mean?

59:33.453 --> 59:35.252
It means that
we can't have someone

59:35.254 --> 59:37.756
this close to the case
helping investigate it.

59:38.291 --> 59:41.060
It's my fault for getting you
involved in the first place.

59:41.693 --> 59:44.228
I did it because we had
already lost so much time.

59:44.230 --> 59:46.230
You're cutting me off?

59:46.232 --> 59:49.469
Every professional who should
be working on this case

59:50.236 --> 59:51.935
is working on this case.

59:51.937 --> 59:54.305
All I'm trying to do
is to help you find my daughter!

59:54.307 --> 59:56.908
I know. But you can't
see things clearly.

59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.313
Who's the one
who brought you to the car?

01:00:00.745 --> 01:00:03.847
Who's the one who found the lake
and brought you to the car?

01:00:03.849 --> 01:00:06.118
If it wasn't for me... not you...

01:00:06.452 --> 01:00:08.051
you and I would both be thinking

01:00:08.053 --> 01:00:09.886
that my Margot ran away,
but because of me, we...

01:00:09.888 --> 01:00:11.390
We don't know
that she didn't run away.

01:00:11.723 --> 01:00:14.260
She had cash in her car.

01:00:14.793 --> 01:00:16.360
But what we do know

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:19.430
is that a 17-year-old boy
is in the hospital...

01:00:19.432 --> 01:00:21.365
- He's gonna be fine.
- You broke his jaw!

01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:22.602
- Mom?
- Robert! What...

01:00:25.971 --> 01:00:28.173
Sweetheart, let me take care of this.
Please.

01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:41.887
If you have a suspicion
about someone, that's fine.

01:00:43.088 --> 01:00:45.056
But then it is the police's job

01:00:46.124 --> 01:00:47.657
to look for proof,

01:00:47.659 --> 01:00:51.129
not yours to act
on flakes of evidence.

01:00:56.268 --> 01:00:57.470
Vick,
I shouldn't have done that.

01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:01.840
From now on,
you just tell me what you need.

01:01:02.174 --> 01:01:03.208
We need nothing from you.

01:01:06.144 --> 01:01:09.481
I'm going back to the field.
Do not call me until I call you.

01:01:10.315 --> 01:01:13.151
- Vick, please.
- Get some sleep, Mr. Kim.

01:01:13.685 --> 01:01:14.686
[end call beeps]

01:01:24.362 --> 01:01:26.429
Don't lie to me.
Don't walk away from me.

01:01:26.431 --> 01:01:27.832
Don't walk away. Hey.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.135
[indistinct chatter]

01:01:43.548 --> 01:01:44.416
[man] Oh, shit.

01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:48.751
- [man 2] Hey! Stop!
- [man 3] Stop! Stop! Hey!

01:01:48.753 --> 01:01:50.086
- Hey! Stop!
- Son of a bitch!

01:01:50.088 --> 01:01:51.056
Shit!

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.625
- Oh, shit!
- Get off!

01:01:55.327 --> 01:01:56.261
What'd you do to her?

01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:57.761
What'd you do to her?

01:01:58.997 --> 01:02:00.265
- [chime]
- [inhales sharply]

01:02:57.821 --> 01:03:02.126
Has anyone even considered the possibility
that it was an absolute stranger?

01:03:02.594 --> 01:03:07.064
Some sick perv in the middle of
the woods sees a little girl...

01:05:30.774 --> 01:05:33.911
[TV, indistinct]

01:05:50.928 --> 01:05:51.961
Looking for
something to drink?

01:05:52.396 --> 01:05:54.229
- Yeah.
- Coffee?

01:05:54.231 --> 01:05:55.630
Yeah, coffee would be
awesome, thanks.

01:05:55.632 --> 01:05:56.600
All right.

01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:01.305
No, you know what,

01:06:01.738 --> 01:06:04.040
you've been probably straight-chugging
caffeine the last three days.

01:06:04.675 --> 01:06:07.642
I am going to make you
some tea.

01:06:07.644 --> 01:06:09.780
- [water running]
- Herbal.

01:06:10.747 --> 01:06:14.585
Um, I got to go to my car for a minute.
I'll be right back, yeah?

01:06:17.387 --> 01:06:18.254
[water off]

01:06:22.392 --> 01:06:23.259
[sighs]

01:06:50.687 --> 01:06:52.522
[kettle whistling]

01:06:57.694 --> 01:06:59.663
[whistling grows louder]

01:07:09.505 --> 01:07:10.506
Hmm.

01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:12.675
How's the detective?

01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:16.412
She working on any new leads?

01:07:19.115 --> 01:07:19.983
No.

01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:21.317
She's not.

01:07:33.496 --> 01:07:35.331
What was your relationship
like with Margot?

01:07:38.001 --> 01:07:38.869
What do you mean?

01:07:39.468 --> 01:07:40.503
You guys hung out,
right?

01:07:43.339 --> 01:07:44.206
Sure.

01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:47.810
You know, it was, um...

01:07:49.245 --> 01:07:50.379
[clears throat]

01:07:51.213 --> 01:07:52.748
You know,
we didn't hang out much, but...

01:07:55.018 --> 01:07:56.152
You know, it was just...

01:07:56.519 --> 01:07:57.955
When's the last time
you saw her, by the way?

01:08:01.424 --> 01:08:03.125
[exhales] Um...

01:08:04.193 --> 01:08:05.225
You know what,
I'd have to think...

01:08:05.227 --> 01:08:07.296
[phone ringing]

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:09.398
I think this needs some honey.

01:08:12.935 --> 01:08:15.171
[ringing continues]

01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:21.611
- [end call beeps]
- Who was that?

01:08:23.578 --> 01:08:24.447
Work.

01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:27.216
Oh, yeah. Uh...

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:29.950
What have they been saying
to you this whole time?

01:08:29.952 --> 01:08:31.251
Going back to
the previous question,

01:08:31.252 --> 01:08:32.421
when's the last time
you saw her?

01:08:34.624 --> 01:08:36.124
Dude... [chuckles]

01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:37.926
I can barely remember.

01:08:39.095 --> 01:08:40.761
But you know what, let's...

01:08:40.763 --> 01:08:42.598
let's get our minds off this
for a sec, huh?

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:47.069
I feel like we're just gonna drive
each other crazy talking about it.

01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:49.104
Hey, is your tea okay?

01:08:50.006 --> 01:08:51.040
You still want that coffee?

01:08:51.674 --> 01:08:53.975
- "Last night was fun."
- What was that?

01:09:00.515 --> 01:09:02.216
"I feel so weird
doing this."

01:09:05.252 --> 01:09:06.455
"Don't tell your father."

01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:10.191
"He'd kill me."

01:09:11.794 --> 01:09:13.294
"Seriously,
he'd murder me."

01:09:15.464 --> 01:09:17.533
And then
seven different times:

01:09:18.265 --> 01:09:19.502
"See you tonight."

01:09:21.403 --> 01:09:22.537
What'd you do
to my daughter?

01:09:26.908 --> 01:09:28.044
What'd you do
to my daughter?

01:09:31.913 --> 01:09:33.348
I can explain, all right?

01:09:35.417 --> 01:09:37.618
But you know what,
let's calm down.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.154
- Let's grab a seat.
- What'd you do to my daughter?

01:09:39.854 --> 01:09:40.823
Wait.

01:09:41.256 --> 01:09:42.290
Stop!

01:09:43.024 --> 01:09:44.524
[grunts] What the...

01:09:44.526 --> 01:09:45.993
What'd you do to her?

01:09:45.995 --> 01:09:47.861
- Please!
- What'd you do to her?

01:09:47.863 --> 01:09:50.966
[shouting] What'd you do to her?
What were you doing with her?

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:52.733
[gagging]

01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:54.069
Weed!

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.376
[coughing, gasping]

01:10:03.311 --> 01:10:05.047
- What?
- Weed!

01:10:08.084 --> 01:10:09.952
I was smoking her out.

01:10:10.685 --> 01:10:12.121
- [phone chimes]
- [coughing]

01:10:16.257 --> 01:10:18.626
[gasps, panting]

01:10:23.665 --> 01:10:25.400
[water running]

01:10:27.335 --> 01:10:29.368
When you guys all came back
from New Year's...

01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:30.670
[water turns off]

01:10:30.672 --> 01:10:32.041
...she found my piece.

01:10:33.675 --> 01:10:35.343
She wanted to try it, and...

01:10:36.544 --> 01:10:37.679
it just kept happening.

01:10:38.013 --> 01:10:40.216
You gave drugs to my daughter?

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.549
I promised her
I wouldn't tell.

01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:45.485
So she would come to you
in the middle of the night

01:10:45.487 --> 01:10:47.754
and you would give her weed
and do God knows what else?

01:10:47.756 --> 01:10:48.890
That's it.

01:10:50.226 --> 01:10:52.560
- We'd get high and talk. I swear.
- [chime]

01:10:54.063 --> 01:10:57.133
Look, I know
how wrong all this sounds,

01:10:57.365 --> 01:10:59.267
and I know I should've
told you sooner, but...

01:11:00.668 --> 01:11:02.971
Look, I didn't think it had
anything to do with this.

01:11:05.107 --> 01:11:06.441
What kind of a brother are you?

01:11:09.944 --> 01:11:10.879
You're asking me?

01:11:11.579 --> 01:11:14.080
[phone ringing, vibrating]

01:11:14.082 --> 01:11:17.583
You come in here and accuse me of
something un-fucking-speakable,

01:11:17.585 --> 01:11:19.687
and you're wondering
what kind of family I am?

01:11:20.155 --> 01:11:21.790
- [sighs]
- [ringing continues]

01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:25.927
Do you want to know why
she hated those piano lessons?

01:11:27.896 --> 01:11:29.929
It's because
every time she would walk in,

01:11:29.931 --> 01:11:32.767
she would see that thing and she
would think about her mother.

01:11:34.769 --> 01:11:35.670
She told you that?

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.109
She told you that
and not me? Why?

01:11:41.309 --> 01:11:44.078
Because you never asked.

01:11:45.246 --> 01:11:46.648
Ever since Pam,

01:11:47.048 --> 01:11:49.549
you stopped talking to Margot
about the only thing

01:11:49.551 --> 01:11:51.352
that's been on her mind
the last two years.

01:11:54.289 --> 01:11:56.124
She needed you
to talk to her...

01:11:57.926 --> 01:11:59.027
not the other way around.

01:12:14.275 --> 01:12:15.877
I just thought
it would fix itself.

01:12:18.012 --> 01:12:19.547
[chime]

01:12:30.325 --> 01:12:31.192
[Vick's voice] <i>David.</i>

01:12:32.026 --> 01:12:33.328
<i>We... We got him.</i>

01:12:34.762 --> 01:12:36.396
<i>His name is Randy Cartoff.</i>

01:12:39.433 --> 01:12:40.969
[continues, indistinct]

01:12:51.445 --> 01:12:53.014
[crying]

01:12:55.515 --> 01:12:56.383
Davy?

01:12:56.617 --> 01:12:58.452
[sobbing] Oh, God.

01:13:00.054 --> 01:13:01.956
- Davy.
- Oh, God.

01:13:04.359 --> 01:13:06.393
[sobbing continues]

01:13:07.527 --> 01:13:12.566
[male announcer] <i>This is Eyewitness
News with live breaking news.</i>

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.500
Good morning. I'm Faustine Rea.

01:13:15.502 --> 01:13:17.836
A parent's worst nightmare
comes true this morning

01:13:17.838 --> 01:13:18.772
for David Kim.

01:13:19.007 --> 01:13:20.273
In a shocking and thoroughly

01:13:20.275 --> 01:13:21.908
mind-boggling conclusion

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:23.842
to a story that's captivated
the Bay Area,

01:13:23.844 --> 01:13:26.546
Margot Kim,
missing now for five days,

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:29.549
has just been
tragically declared dead.

01:13:30.051 --> 01:13:32.419
Why? A taped confession.

01:13:32.853 --> 01:13:35.587
Randy Cartoff,
released just six years ago

01:13:35.589 --> 01:13:38.359
for felony drug possession
and sexual assault,

01:13:38.592 --> 01:13:42.696
uploaded the confession online
before taking his own life.

01:13:43.364 --> 01:13:44.397
We're going to show you

01:13:44.399 --> 01:13:45.563
a segment of

01:13:45.565 --> 01:13:46.598
the three-minute video now,

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.734
but please be warned:

01:13:48.102 --> 01:13:49.235
the following contains

01:13:49.237 --> 01:13:50.336
graphic descriptions

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:51.872
and disturbing content.

01:13:52.273 --> 01:13:54.208
Viewer discretion is advised.

01:13:57.945 --> 01:13:59.314
Dear girl in the green car,

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:02.115
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

01:14:03.384 --> 01:14:05.953
And I'm sorry for not listening to
you when you begged me to stop.

01:14:08.755 --> 01:14:11.959
I'm sorry for beating you
and crushing you

01:14:13.126 --> 01:14:16.331
and tossing you with your suitcases
so no one would ever find you.

01:14:19.466 --> 01:14:21.501
I thought this would be easy,
but it isn't.

01:14:26.473 --> 01:14:28.441
When we arrived
at his Morgan Hill residence,

01:14:28.443 --> 01:14:30.241
Mr. Cartoff was deceased,

01:14:30.243 --> 01:14:32.447
seemingly by
a self-inflicted gun wound.

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.480
Sometimes these confessions
are hoaxes,

01:14:35.482 --> 01:14:37.082
but based on his story,

01:14:37.084 --> 01:14:39.150
we were able to return
to the lake site,

01:14:39.152 --> 01:14:43.424
where we discovered trace DNA
matching that of Mr. Cartoff

01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:46.693
in critical areas
of the search zone.

01:14:48.429 --> 01:14:50.263
I've already spoken
to her father.

01:14:51.665 --> 01:14:53.531
But at this point
in the investigation,

01:14:53.533 --> 01:14:55.335
we are very confident...

01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:58.872
that Miss Kim's life was taken

01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:01.375
on her way out of town.

[audio fades]

01:15:13.687 --> 01:15:15.022
It still doesn't make sense.

01:15:18.225 --> 01:15:19.993
Where's the car that he took her in?
Where's the...

01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:21.862
the suitcases?

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:24.364
Did he...
did he clean up the blood?

01:15:26.166 --> 01:15:27.200
Vick, who is this guy?

01:15:28.135 --> 01:15:29.102
I don't know.

01:15:29.469 --> 01:15:30.670
I wish I had an answer.

01:15:32.806 --> 01:15:35.409
All I know,
and all you need to know,

01:15:35.809 --> 01:15:38.677
is that this had
nothing to do with you.

01:15:43.549 --> 01:15:44.484
Yes, it did.

01:15:52.526 --> 01:15:54.526
[sniffles]

01:15:54.528 --> 01:15:56.027
I am so sorry for everything

01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:57.097
that happened to your daughter.

01:15:58.298 --> 01:15:59.797

that happened to you.

01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:04.002
And if there's anything

01:16:04.004 --> 01:16:04.871
I can do for you,

01:16:05.439 --> 01:16:07.773
please do not hesitate to call.

01:16:14.281 --> 01:16:15.482
- Okay.

Wake up. [giggles]

01:17:41.967 --> 01:17:43.335
- Wake up.
- [chuckles] Okay, all right.

01:17:43.603 --> 01:17:45.738
[Pam] Margot, show Daddy
what you made in school.

01:17:47.339 --> 01:17:49.074
[giggling]

01:17:55.681 --> 01:17:56.682
That's not...

01:20:33.071 --> 01:20:34.303
<i>You must have the wrong number.</i>

01:20:34.305 --> 01:20:36.272
<i>I'm talent, not representation.</i>

01:20:36.274 --> 01:20:37.840

01:20:39.177 --> 01:20:40.476

01:20:40.478 --> 01:20:41.778

[David] <i>I don't understand.

01:20:54.425 --> 01:20:55.593

01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:51.382
<i>Mr. Kim. I am so sorry
to hear about Margot.</i>

- Thank you.

01:21:54.218 --> 01:21:56.252
- Yeah, thank you.
- <i>Especially Rosemary.</i>

<i>I have never seen someone
so invested in a case.</i>

01:21:58.589 --> 01:22:00.955
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>From the moment she volunteered to lead it,</i>

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:03.058
- <i>the way she handled the investigation...</i>
- Wait.

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.060
<i>...and really dealt with
the media, I mean...</i>

01:22:05.062 --> 01:22:07.231
Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
She... [stammers]

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.169
- Did you say "volunteered"?
- <i>Sorry?</i>

01:22:12.035 --> 01:22:14.172
Y-You said she volunteered.

01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:16.908
[stammers] No. I was led
to believe that she...

01:22:17.442 --> 01:22:19.610
she was assigned to the case, right?
She was assigned.

01:22:20.545 --> 01:22:22.780
<i>No. She definitely volunteered.</i>

01:22:27.785 --> 01:22:29.387
<i>Unfortunately, though, I...</i>

01:22:29.587 --> 01:22:31.756
<i>I still can't patch you
through dispatch.</i>

01:22:32.055 --> 01:22:35.091
<i>She's probably on her way
to Margot's vigil, though.</i>

to her work voice mail instead.</i>

01:26:25.655 --> 01:26:29.791
Ms. Vick, as your counsel was
informed, by signing this document,

01:26:29.793 --> 01:26:32.827
you hereby verify
the confession you provide today

01:26:32.829 --> 01:26:34.628
pertaining to the crimes
you are accused of

01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:36.498
after your arrest one week ago.

01:26:37.433 --> 01:26:39.366
The DA's office
will then consider leniency

01:26:39.368 --> 01:26:41.236
on any charges related
to the case,

01:26:42.604 --> 01:26:44.339
including first-degree murder.

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:48.142
[male anchor 1] Excuse us.
We're taking you now

01:26:48.144 --> 01:26:49.643
to San Jose, California,

01:26:49.645 --> 01:26:50.878
where we're getting word now

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.014
that a law enforcement officer

01:26:53.016 --> 01:26:56.717
has just been taken into custody
at the vigil for a local teen

01:26:56.719 --> 01:26:58.687
who's been missing
since last Thursday.

01:26:59.388 --> 01:27:01.690
[helicopter whirring]

01:27:02.826 --> 01:27:06.261
[detective] <i>Let's start with Thursday,
May 11th, when Margot Kim went missing.</i>

01:27:07.163 --> 01:27:08.330
What happened that night?

01:27:09.398 --> 01:27:11.700
- I got a phone call.
- And who was calling?

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:15.337
My son.

01:27:16.238 --> 01:27:18.638
[phone ringing]

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:19.508
[Robert] <i>Mom.</i>

01:27:20.309 --> 01:27:21.510
[voice breaking]
<i>I made a big mistake.</i>

01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:24.013
<i>I think I need to call 911.</i>

01:27:24.214 --> 01:27:25.912
[detective] <i>What did you do
after hearing the call?</i>

01:27:25.914 --> 01:27:28.517
- [Vick] <i>I met him.</i>
<i>- Where?</i>

01:27:29.018 --> 01:27:31.820
[Vick] <i>Near Barbosa Lake. He was
standing on the edge of a ravine.</i>

01:27:33.089 --> 01:27:34.923
[detective] <i>What did Robert
tell you when you got there?</i>

01:27:35.924 --> 01:27:37.457
He said,
"There's a girl down there.

01:27:37.459 --> 01:27:39.661
I accidentally pushed a girl
down there."

01:27:40.362 --> 01:27:41.231
I asked him why.

01:27:41.563 --> 01:27:42.464
What did he say?

01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:44.965
You need to understand
that my son

01:27:44.967 --> 01:27:46.767
is not like other kids.
He's different.

01:27:46.769 --> 01:27:47.701
He can be very...

01:27:47.703 --> 01:27:49.505
What did he say?

01:27:52.741 --> 01:27:55.308
[Vick] <i>Six months ago,
Robert recognized Margot</i>

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:56.678
<i>on a live blogging website.</i>

01:28:01.984 --> 01:28:03.852
<i>He'd liked her
since grade school.</i>

01:28:09.057 --> 01:28:10.260
<i>Knew all about her life.</i>

01:28:15.164 --> 01:28:16.031
<i>Her interests.</i>

01:28:19.902 --> 01:28:20.969
[detective] <i>So, what did he do?</i>

01:28:23.672 --> 01:28:24.807
[Vick] <i>Made up a story.</i>

01:28:26.942 --> 01:28:27.843
<i>A new identity.</i>

01:28:28.577 --> 01:28:30.644
[Margot]
This one I took at a forest.

01:28:30.646 --> 01:28:32.579
[Vick] <i>For six months,
they were friends.</i>

01:28:32.581 --> 01:28:35.250
You work 25 hours
on top of school?

01:28:37.219 --> 01:28:39.353
[Vick] <i>It was just role-playing.
It was harmless.</i>

01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.991
[detective] <i>Until the money.</i>

01:28:44.793 --> 01:28:46.662
[Vick] <i>She found his username
on Venmo.</i>

01:28:47.796 --> 01:28:51.533
<i>She sent $2,500
to cover hospital expenses.</i>

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.303
[detective]
<i>Expenses that didn't exist.</i>

01:28:55.403 --> 01:28:56.572
[Vick] <i>She was a good kid.</i>

01:28:57.606 --> 01:28:59.440
[detective] <i>So he decided
to give her money back.</i>

01:29:00.909 --> 01:29:02.476
He had to come clean.
It was over.

01:29:03.912 --> 01:29:05.547
Why didn't he just
give it to her at school?

01:29:06.615 --> 01:29:09.184
Margot could've reacted
the wrong way in public.

01:29:10.518 --> 01:29:12.520
Robert does not like
that kind of attention.

01:29:15.924 --> 01:29:16.959
[detective] <i>So he followed her.</i>

01:29:18.593 --> 01:29:19.527
[Vick] <i>He followed her.</i>

01:29:20.762 --> 01:29:22.394
[detective]
<i>And what was Margot doing</i>

01:29:22.396 --> 01:29:24.297
<i>when your son arrived
at the lake?</i>

01:29:24.299 --> 01:29:25.868
[Vick] <i>Getting high in her car.</i>

01:29:26.134 --> 01:29:27.903
- Then what happened?
- He got in.

01:29:28.804 --> 01:29:30.371
She screamed. She hit him.

01:29:30.671 --> 01:29:32.839
Before he could even realize
that he was bleeding,

01:29:32.841 --> 01:29:35.507
she was running, calling for
help, and he ran after her.

01:29:35.509 --> 01:29:37.244
- <i>It was pitch-black.</i>
- [ringing]

01:29:37.246 --> 01:29:39.614
[footsteps running]

01:29:41.216 --> 01:29:44.253
<i>He was not trying to hurt her.
He was trying to explain.</i>

01:29:44.752 --> 01:29:49.421
But she was punching him and
screaming, and he just... he reacted.

01:29:49.423 --> 01:29:51.126
He... he pushed back.

01:29:52.593 --> 01:29:53.527
And she fell.

01:29:55.463 --> 01:29:56.298
Just...

01:29:57.665 --> 01:29:58.597
just disappeared.

01:29:58.599 --> 01:29:59.968
[sniffles]

01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:02.971
So, your son calls you,

01:30:03.671 --> 01:30:05.537
asks you to help
cover up a murder...

01:30:05.539 --> 01:30:06.574
No. No.

01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:09.311
It was my decision.

01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:11.945
[Vick] Baby?
I don't want you calling anyone.

01:30:11.947 --> 01:30:13.714
Mommy's gonna take care
of everything.

01:30:14.016 --> 01:30:15.317
<i>It was my decision.</i>

01:30:16.918 --> 01:30:17.919
<i>Not his.</i>

01:30:19.388 --> 01:30:20.922
[detective] <i>So, now you're
looking down a ravine.</i>

01:30:21.622 --> 01:30:23.491
<i>- Did you go down?
- I tried.</i>

01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:26.425
But it was narrow, jagged,
impossible without SAR.

01:30:26.427 --> 01:30:29.229
- So, how did you figure that sh...
- That she was dead?

01:30:29.231 --> 01:30:33.268
It was narrow, jagged, and at
least 50 feet to rock bottom.

01:30:34.535 --> 01:30:36.003
And it was dead quiet.

01:30:37.071 --> 01:30:40.407
So you helped your son.

01:30:40.409 --> 01:30:43.778
[Vick] <i>I dumped the car in the lake
and took charge of the investigation.</i>

01:30:45.213 --> 01:30:47.148
<i>I convinced David
his daughter ran away.</i>

01:30:48.716 --> 01:30:50.918
<i>Said forensics had
Margot's hard drive.</i>

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.020
<i>And told
the law enforcement team</i>

01:30:55.022 --> 01:30:57.223
<i>we'd already cleared the zone
I knew her body was in.</i>

01:30:57.225 --> 01:30:58.891
[detective] <i>But still,
it was only a matter of time</i>

01:30:58.893 --> 01:30:59.894
<i>before they'd find the spot.</i>

01:31:02.063 --> 01:31:03.831
Which is why
I needed a confession.

01:31:06.435 --> 01:31:08.502
It was the only thing
that would make it stop.

01:31:10.071 --> 01:31:12.006
So you drugged up
an ex-con you knew

01:31:12.407 --> 01:31:13.607
and fed him a script.

01:31:16.378 --> 01:31:17.645
Was it really a suicide?

01:31:24.051 --> 01:31:24.986
He's my son.

01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:32.526
<i>Do you know what prison would do
to someone like him?</i>

01:31:39.233 --> 01:31:40.368
He made a mistake.

01:31:47.507 --> 01:31:50.843
[anchor 1] For those of you just joining,
we are now following the police SUV

01:31:50.845 --> 01:31:54.313
transporting Detective Vick
and the father of Miss Kim...

01:31:54.315 --> 01:31:56.782
[detective] <i>So, after your arrest,
on the way to the station,</i>

01:31:56.784 --> 01:32:00.019
<i>you didn't say a word to anyone
until Mr. Kim asked you</i>

01:32:00.021 --> 01:32:01.722
<i>was his daughter actually dead.</i>

01:32:02.690 --> 01:32:03.691
What did you tell him?

01:32:04.025 --> 01:32:05.224
I said even if Margot

01:32:05.226 --> 01:32:06.358
had survived the fall she took

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.560
it wouldn't have mattered.

01:32:07.795 --> 01:32:08.961
She still would've had to live

01:32:08.963 --> 01:32:10.498
five days without water.

01:32:11.531 --> 01:32:12.733
And how did David respond?

01:32:14.902 --> 01:32:16.603
[Vick] <i>He told them
to turn the car around.</i>

01:32:18.739 --> 01:32:19.672
[detective] <i>Why?</i>

01:32:21.909 --> 01:32:23.444
[Vick]
<i>He said it'd been two days.</i>

01:32:23.878 --> 01:32:25.980
[anchor 1] And hold on a second.

01:32:26.646 --> 01:32:29.517
[Vick] <i>She'd only have to live
without water for two days.</i>

01:32:30.151 --> 01:32:31.682
[anchor 1]
And it looks as though

01:32:31.684 --> 01:32:32.987
they're making
a U-turn right now.

01:32:33.354 --> 01:32:34.687
[Vick] <i>There was a storm
on Monday.</i>

01:32:35.423 --> 01:32:37.256
[anchor 1] They're heading off
in the other direction.

01:32:37.258 --> 01:32:38.959
[continues, indistinct]

01:32:45.299 --> 01:32:47.332
[male anchor 2] We're currently
watching live footage

01:32:47.334 --> 01:32:49.001
from our affiliates
in the Bay Area

01:32:49.003 --> 01:32:50.469
of a recovery operation

01:32:50.471 --> 01:32:52.371
for missing teen Margot Kim,

01:32:52.373 --> 01:32:54.373
who authorities now believe
is at the bottom of

01:32:54.375 --> 01:32:56.208
this Northern California ravine.

01:32:56.210 --> 01:32:58.177
[female anchor]
Presumed dead only hours ago,

01:32:58.179 --> 01:33:01.413
the search for Margot Kim
is revitalized this evening

01:33:01.415 --> 01:33:03.348
after a suspect in custody

01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:07.052
has provided authorities
with Miss Kim's exact location.

01:33:07.054 --> 01:33:08.853
The only question that remains:

01:33:08.855 --> 01:33:11.292
is Margot still alive,

01:33:11.591 --> 01:33:13.724
or is it already too late?

01:33:13.726 --> 01:33:15.860
[anchor 2] We are continuing
to monitor the ground,

01:33:15.862 --> 01:33:18.896
as it appears that everyone
is still just waiting

01:33:18.898 --> 01:33:20.898
for any update
on the operation below.

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:22.867
But hold on. Hold on.

01:33:22.869 --> 01:33:24.403
We are just getting word now

01:33:24.405 --> 01:33:26.338
that rescue responders
are beginning an ascent.

01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.240
Again, for our viewers,
we do not know

01:33:28.242 --> 01:33:30.708
what we're about to see here
as we get a peek around...

01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:32.110
And there she is.

01:33:32.112 --> 01:33:33.678
We are getting
a closer look now,

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.713
as two rescue responders are
pulling up

01:33:35.715 --> 01:33:39.284
what appears to be Margot Kim
in a body basket

01:33:39.286 --> 01:33:42.521
- to the top of this ravine here.
- [male reporter] Again, we just want to warn our viewers

01:33:42.523 --> 01:33:45.257
that we do not know
what state she's in,

01:33:45.259 --> 01:33:47.292
as we get a look
at Margot's father there.

01:33:47.294 --> 01:33:49.595
But they are making their way
up to the top.

01:33:49.597 --> 01:33:51.798
[female reporter] And it looks like
responders have gotten her up.

01:33:52.065 --> 01:33:54.132
Again, no word yet
as to her status.

01:33:54.134 --> 01:33:55.900
[female reporter 2] And there
you can see her father,

01:33:55.902 --> 01:33:57.569
as it appears
that Search and Rescue

01:33:57.571 --> 01:34:00.238
is now preparing
to lift Margot's body basket

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.006
onto a stretcher
they've just prepared.

01:34:02.008 --> 01:34:04.075
[anchor 1] Again, this is
live footage here,

01:34:04.077 --> 01:34:07.311
as Margot Kim, who has been
missing for the last week,

01:34:07.313 --> 01:34:10.148
is now being lifted
onto an emergency...

01:34:10.150 --> 01:34:12.685
- [dialogue fades]
- [helicopter whirring]

01:34:20.426 --> 01:34:22.463
[helicopter whirring slows,
distorts]

01:36:53.154 --> 01:36:58.154
