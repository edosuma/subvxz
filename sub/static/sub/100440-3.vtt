WEBVTT

00:06.717 --> 00:09.226
The initial surge failed because
of poor military strategy.

00:09.284 --> 00:11.324
What? No.
The strategy was sound.

00:11.409 --> 00:12.652
The intel was faulty.

00:12.737 --> 00:16.557
Yet, they eventually triumphed
despite inferior technology.

00:16.642 --> 00:17.284
- Right?
- Ah!

00:17.369 --> 00:19.354
Military history buffs, eh?
Well, me, too.

00:19.439 --> 00:20.885
So, what are
we talking about, huh?

00:21.125 --> 00:23.591
Battle of the Bulge?
Battle of Midway?

00:23.676 --> 00:25.301
- Battle of...
- Endor.

00:27.003 --> 00:28.712
Star Wars? Episode VI?

00:28.805 --> 00:31.317
The Rebels' problem
was that Palpatine leaked intel

00:31.402 --> 00:32.856
to the Bothan spies,
and everybody knows that.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.872
That's true, but if the Rebels
had a different attack formation...

00:34.956 --> 00:36.394
Hang on a second.

00:36.813 --> 00:38.772
Are we seriously
debating this?

00:40.948 --> 00:42.934
The Alliance should've bribed
the Hutt syndicate

00:43.019 --> 00:45.660
to start a rebellion, thus
distracting the Imperial armada.

00:45.745 --> 00:46.763
Bing, bang, bong.

00:46.848 --> 00:48.348
Bob's your uncle, 
battle over.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.579
I can't reason with you people.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.580
- I'm out.
- Well, h-hang on a second.

00:53.665 --> 00:55.487
We haven't discussed
the reactor core yet.

00:55.572 --> 00:57.094
Uh, speaking of spies...

00:57.836 --> 00:59.883
I spoke to your father recently.

00:59.967 --> 01:01.261
He's still
pursuing Mason

01:01.346 --> 01:02.581
for burning down the Phoenix.

01:02.665 --> 01:04.572
Uh, why are you talking
to my dad?

01:04.953 --> 01:07.890
Just getting intel on Bishop.
They worked together at DXS.

01:07.975 --> 01:10.197
Right. He tell you
anything interesting?

01:10.281 --> 01:13.708
Hmm, you won't return his calls.
That was interesting.

01:13.793 --> 01:14.981
Well, I generally don't

01:15.066 --> 01:17.364
with people who completely
obliterate my trust.

01:17.449 --> 01:19.769
That's fair enough, but he did
save your life, didn't he?

01:21.734 --> 01:23.696
Well, someone's been
snooping through my file.

01:23.781 --> 01:26.292
Mm. It's not snooping
if you own the company.

01:26.950 --> 01:28.781
You and your father
fell out over a year ago.

01:28.865 --> 01:30.957
Isn't it about time
you kissed and made up?

01:31.041 --> 01:32.219
Time to forgive.

01:32.303 --> 01:34.392
Oh, forgiveness
isn't Mac's strong suit.

01:34.697 --> 01:37.094
Coming from someone who wouldn't
forgive me, that's rich.

01:37.178 --> 01:40.662
If your apology came from you
and not Phil Collins...

01:40.746 --> 01:42.186
His lyrics...
Correction, poetry...

01:42.270 --> 01:43.274
Said everything I wanted to.

01:43.358 --> 01:45.015
They would've been perfect, Mac,

01:45.099 --> 01:47.060
- if I was dating Phil Collins. 
- Hey, do you guys know

01:47.144 --> 01:48.975
where they keep
the parachutes on this plane?

01:49.059 --> 01:50.585
We're fine. It's fine.

01:50.669 --> 01:52.631
Everybody, seat belts on.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.333 --> 02:04.581
Why'd an F-16 just
give us a flyby?

02:05.198 --> 02:07.253
That fighter jet
was scrambled from Edwards

02:07.338 --> 02:08.473
to check out a ghost plane

02:08.556 --> 02:10.207
just 20 nautical miles

02:10.292 --> 02:12.259
from your position.
Ghost plane?

02:12.343 --> 02:14.660
Does that mean it doesn't
respond to radio communication?

02:14.745 --> 02:15.828
Or cellular.

02:15.912 --> 02:17.996
Air traffic control
says it's a Cessna

02:18.081 --> 02:19.832
208 Caravan registered

02:19.917 --> 02:21.894
to a commercial aircraft
engineer

02:21.979 --> 02:23.488
named Ben Reinman.

02:23.572 --> 02:26.035
Reinman's flight plan shows him
on a day trip starting

02:26.120 --> 02:28.043
and ending at Moorpark Airport,
but he missed

02:28.128 --> 02:30.284
his arrival and just flew by
without any explanation.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.682
Could be terrorism,
a faulty transmitter,

02:32.767 --> 02:34.987
- or anything in between.
- Only one way to find out:

02:35.072 --> 02:36.903
get eyes on the Cessna.
Hence the F-16.

02:36.988 --> 02:39.315
Looping you in
to USAF audio.

02:40.112 --> 02:41.277
<i>Completed flyby.</i>

02:41.361 --> 02:43.847
<i>Cessna's going too slow
to permit clear visual, over.</i>

02:43.932 --> 02:45.763
<i>Repeat, I have no visual.</i>

02:45.964 --> 02:48.056
Turboprops max out
at 180 knots.

02:48.148 --> 02:50.153
An F-16's stall speed is
250.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.262
That pilot can't go slow enough
to check out the Cessna

02:52.346 --> 02:54.175
- or he'll crash.
- What is our stall speed?

02:54.260 --> 02:55.742
170.

02:56.323 --> 02:57.552
I like what you're thinking.

02:57.695 --> 02:59.526
Turn around
and get eyes on that plane.

02:59.611 --> 03:00.729
Excuse me, Matilda,

03:00.814 --> 03:02.550
but as financier
of this operation, I think

03:02.635 --> 03:04.932
the expenditure of the
jet fuel is up to me.

03:08.399 --> 03:10.358
Turn around and get eyes
on that plane.

03:20.526 --> 03:22.098
We have visual.

03:22.182 --> 03:23.229
You see the pilot?

03:23.313 --> 03:24.440
Yep.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.187
But he's not flying the plane.

03:27.778 --> 03:29.253
Then who is?

03:30.143 --> 03:31.776
No one.

03:34.573 --> 03:36.307
He looks unconscious.

03:36.624 --> 03:38.253
The plane must be on autopilot.

03:38.546 --> 03:39.769
If he doesn't wake up

03:39.854 --> 03:40.852
before that plane
runs out of fuel,

03:40.937 --> 03:41.981
he's gonna fall out of the sky.

03:42.065 --> 03:43.508
Oh, it gets worse.

03:44.883 --> 03:47.538
There's a kid in there.

03:49.685 --> 03:52.987
Oh, yes.
That is worse.

04:14.589 --> 04:16.281
<font color=#FF00FF>*MAcGYVER (2016)*</font>

Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Kid + Plane + Cable + Truck"</font>

04:25.977 --> 04:27.037
Skinny,

04:27.153 --> 04:29.071
- brown hair.
- That's him.

04:29.376 --> 04:31.563
The pilot's son, Asher.
Ten years old.

04:31.648 --> 04:33.474
We need him to tell
us what happened.

04:33.558 --> 04:36.430
Use frequency 119.9.

04:36.915 --> 04:39.365
Can't. Looks like the radio's

04:39.450 --> 04:41.191
going through
his dad's headphones.

04:42.634 --> 04:44.969
He needs to switch
the audio output to speaker.

04:45.398 --> 04:46.525
How do you get
someone to listen

04:46.609 --> 04:48.266
if they can't hear us
in the first place?

04:48.351 --> 04:51.270
We use a different type
of radio.

04:51.663 --> 04:53.282
You might think
the only way to hear

04:53.367 --> 04:55.764
a radio signal is, well,
with a radio.

04:55.849 --> 04:57.469
But all you need is metal.

04:57.554 --> 04:59.532
Metals absorb radio signals,

04:59.617 --> 05:00.969
and if the signal's
strong enough,

05:01.054 --> 05:02.720
the metal oscillates
and vibrates

05:02.805 --> 05:05.188
the surrounding air,
producing noise.

05:05.322 --> 05:08.079
This DIY AM transmitter
will create sound

05:08.164 --> 05:09.508
in nearly
any metal appliance.

05:09.593 --> 05:13.087
A heater, a light or a fan,

05:14.352 --> 05:16.081
in which case
the sound will carry

05:16.172 --> 05:17.828
through the plane's vents.

05:19.714 --> 05:21.566
Oh, my God.

05:24.305 --> 05:25.526
Asher?

05:25.735 --> 05:28.555
Come in, Asher.
Asher?

05:28.784 --> 05:30.615
Come in, Asher.

05:30.919 --> 05:32.184
Asher?

05:36.220 --> 05:37.985
Asher, come in, Asher.

05:39.812 --> 05:41.118
Come in, Asher.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.108
If you can hear us,

05:44.193 --> 05:45.545
push the black
button on the yoke.

05:45.659 --> 05:48.383
That's the thing
the pilot uses to steer.

05:50.722 --> 05:51.897
Hello?

05:53.640 --> 05:55.155
Well done, Asher.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.766
Now look to your left.

05:57.337 --> 05:59.304
My team and I are in that plane.

05:59.389 --> 06:02.021
My name's MacGyver,
but you can call me Mac.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.605
- We're gonna get you home safely, okay?
- Okay.

06:04.751 --> 06:06.847
Asher, can you tell me
what happened?

06:07.129 --> 06:09.254
My dad got dizzy
and passed out.

06:09.576 --> 06:11.407
I shook him,
but he won't wake up.

06:11.492 --> 06:13.280
- Is he breathing?
- Yeah,

06:13.474 --> 06:15.174
but he looks bad.

06:15.363 --> 06:16.735
I'm scared.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.216
But you're doing great.

06:18.301 --> 06:19.381
Okay, now I'm
gonna tell you how

06:19.465 --> 06:20.600
to check his pulse.

06:20.685 --> 06:22.296
Put your pointer finger
and middle finger

06:22.381 --> 06:23.848
on the inside
of your dad's wrist,

06:23.933 --> 06:25.496
just below his thumb.

06:25.581 --> 06:27.121
If you don't feel
anything right away,

06:27.206 --> 06:29.027
try moving your fingers
around a little bit.

06:30.043 --> 06:33.246
I feel it, kinda.

06:33.538 --> 06:35.281
Weak pulse and dizziness?

06:35.365 --> 06:36.805
It could be a heart attack.

06:36.889 --> 06:38.850
We need to get him to a
hospital as soon as possible,

06:38.934 --> 06:40.330
if we can get that plane down.

06:40.415 --> 06:41.723
Asher,

06:41.850 --> 06:43.597
I need you to check
the fuel supply.

06:43.682 --> 06:45.754
Okay, that's the fourth gauge
from the left.

06:47.285 --> 06:48.599
What's it say?

06:48.683 --> 06:49.905
One quarter.

06:49.989 --> 06:51.686
That's bad.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.174
All right, so,

06:58.258 --> 07:01.090
quarter tank, 170 knots,
it gives them

07:01.174 --> 07:03.005
less than 45 minutes
before they fall out of the sky?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.177
Without knowing for sure

07:04.261 --> 07:05.790
what's going on with Ben,
we can't count on him

07:05.874 --> 07:06.839
to wake up in time to land.

07:06.924 --> 07:08.793
And chances are slim to none
that a ten-year-old

07:08.877 --> 07:10.969
with no flying experience
could land that plane.

07:11.184 --> 07:13.347
So, what do we do?

07:13.432 --> 07:16.221
Russ, you fly choppers
but not planes?

07:17.073 --> 07:18.862
Well, besides our pilot,
Desi's the only one

07:18.947 --> 07:20.143
who knows
how to fly a Cessna,

07:20.228 --> 07:21.893
so you will be landing it.

07:23.307 --> 07:24.628
I'm gonna get you
from here

07:24.713 --> 07:26.934
to over there.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.727
Zip line. Great idea.

07:43.812 --> 07:45.001
Glad I'm not doing it.

07:45.086 --> 07:48.181
You've accounted for weight,
speed and wind shear.

07:48.266 --> 07:49.173
Okay, makes sense.

07:49.258 --> 07:51.188
Doesn't dickens make sense.
Connecting our planes

07:51.273 --> 07:53.191
could bring us both down.
We'd be much more help to them

07:53.275 --> 07:54.845
if we don't plummet out
the sky.

07:55.022 --> 07:56.807
You have a better idea,
then?

08:00.240 --> 08:01.603
Right. Yes, yes.

08:01.688 --> 08:03.462
We're doing this.
But that boy's voice

08:03.546 --> 08:04.932
is very shaky,
definite signs of shock.

08:05.016 --> 08:06.424
Bozer, why don't
you talk to him,

08:06.509 --> 08:07.728
see if you can calm him
down.

08:07.813 --> 08:08.861
- On it.
- And I'll find

08:08.946 --> 08:10.945
an airport
where Desi can land.

08:15.501 --> 08:17.477
All right, so this zip line.

08:17.579 --> 08:18.739
Explain?

08:18.823 --> 08:20.799
- Have you ever heard of the flying boom?
- Yes,

08:20.883 --> 08:22.846
an Air Force technique
for refueling planes midair.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.935
Exactly, so we will use
the same principle.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.807
Except, instead of
transferring fuel,

08:26.892 --> 08:28.182
we'll transfer Desi and me.

08:28.267 --> 08:29.438
I'm good.
I'll go solo.

08:29.523 --> 08:32.006
Well, somebody has to treat Ben
while you land the plane.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.797
I mean,
we could give you parachutes

08:33.881 --> 08:34.907
you know,
just in case.

08:34.991 --> 08:37.017
This plane only holds
military stealth chutes,

08:37.102 --> 08:38.346
which are good
for one person only.

08:38.429 --> 08:40.907
Given the fact that Asher's
a kid and Ben is unconscious,

08:40.991 --> 08:42.082
we'd have to jump tandem.

08:42.168 --> 08:43.852
So they're useless.
I'm going to build

08:43.938 --> 08:45.627
this zip line out of parts
from this jet.

08:45.712 --> 08:47.512
Here's what I need you guys
to help me gather.

08:48.655 --> 08:50.704
I don't care
if you're short-staffed.

08:50.811 --> 08:52.563
Clear your runway.

08:52.648 --> 08:55.262
All our personnel are working
double time on this.

08:55.374 --> 08:58.336
You kidding?
I can do every Fortnitedance.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.181
What else you play?

09:00.309 --> 09:03.271
Chipmunk Service,
Weasel Wars, Zombie Chasers.

09:03.425 --> 09:06.039
My dad doesn't like me playing
that one because of the zombies,

09:06.412 --> 09:09.157
but it doesn't scare me,
so don't tell him?

09:09.398 --> 09:10.665
Our secret.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.141
So, uh, do you and your dad
go flying often?

09:13.509 --> 09:16.231
No. I don't see him
that much.

09:16.315 --> 09:17.449
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.704
Yeah.
He travels for work a lot.

09:20.096 --> 09:22.071
He inspects airplanes
for an airplane maker.

09:22.398 --> 09:24.884
Must have been pretty special
flying with your dad today, huh?

09:25.264 --> 09:26.613
Yeah.

09:27.265 --> 09:29.110
Till this.

09:30.532 --> 09:32.423
My mom died when I was seven.

09:32.758 --> 09:34.329
Will my dad die, too?

09:36.055 --> 09:37.910
We're gonna
do everything we can.

09:39.689 --> 09:41.001
Hang on.

09:47.635 --> 09:50.195
How to make a zip
line by tearing apart your own plane:

09:50.696 --> 09:53.549
gather cargo hooks
for attaching the cable,

09:53.634 --> 09:57.260
grab a seat cover to create a
drogue parachute for stability,

09:57.345 --> 09:59.556
and, finally,
try not to think about

09:59.641 --> 10:01.306
what an insane idea
this actually is.

10:01.391 --> 10:03.931
Okay. Riley,
can you go tell the pilot

10:04.015 --> 10:07.673
to fly above and ahead of
the Cessna at a 30 degree angle,

10:07.757 --> 10:09.458
just like the...

10:09.542 --> 10:12.153
Flying boom, yeah, got it.

10:18.595 --> 10:21.426
All right, Asher,
here's what I need you to do.

10:21.510 --> 10:22.732
Private airplanes,
they usually have

10:22.816 --> 10:24.690
a maintenance bag in the back.

10:24.774 --> 10:25.877
See if you can
dig in there and find

10:25.961 --> 10:27.759
a long cleaning tool
of some sort.

10:31.254 --> 10:34.493
There's this pole with a weird
rubber thing on one end.

10:34.838 --> 10:36.800
Yeah, that's a squeegee.
That's perfect.

10:36.986 --> 10:40.688
All right, so, you said that
your dad flies a lot, right?

10:40.834 --> 10:42.578
He's probably got
some extra clothes with him.

10:42.662 --> 10:44.212
See if you can find
a wire hanger.

10:50.184 --> 10:51.337
Okay.

10:51.422 --> 10:52.524
All right, that's perfect.

10:52.609 --> 10:54.807
Now take the wire hanger
and bend it into a hook

10:54.892 --> 10:57.419
on one end, and then take the
other end and wrap it tightly

10:57.503 --> 10:58.813
around the squeegee.

10:59.612 --> 11:01.531
Me and my friends have this word
for making things

11:01.615 --> 11:02.924
out of random stuff.

11:03.009 --> 11:04.929
We named it after this guy
who's real good at it.

11:06.586 --> 11:07.586
MacGyver?

11:07.736 --> 11:09.415
No. Jeff.

11:09.971 --> 11:13.409
Like, "My bike chain was broken,
so I Jeffed it."

11:13.898 --> 11:15.116
That's catchy.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.636
- Done.
- Okay.

11:17.721 --> 11:20.985
One more thing I need you
to build, just like Jeff.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.147
Why am I wearing this?

11:30.231 --> 11:31.806
Because you're gonna
open that door.

11:32.407 --> 11:33.672
I'm gonna what?

11:33.757 --> 11:35.665
Yeah, I know,
but it's the only way.

11:35.750 --> 11:38.977
So lift underneath
and roll it up. Russ?

11:39.062 --> 11:40.407
Right.

11:40.507 --> 11:43.095
Someone please tell the pilot
we've lost our minds.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.129
All right, bud, your turn!

12:16.934 --> 12:19.069
This is the emergency tow cable.

12:19.193 --> 12:20.612
You're gonna pull it in
with that hook

12:20.696 --> 12:22.153
that you made.

12:23.949 --> 12:25.563
Desi?

12:47.830 --> 12:50.398
We've got to go higher!

12:51.704 --> 12:53.227
Take the plane higher!

13:23.316 --> 13:25.485
Okay. Now hook the cable
to the metal part

13:25.570 --> 13:28.349
that bolts down
the rear passenger seats.

13:31.787 --> 13:32.966
Did it!

13:34.069 --> 13:35.291
Did it, indeed.

13:35.376 --> 13:37.208
In a few years,
that kid's gonna have your job.

13:37.292 --> 13:38.252
Promise?

13:38.337 --> 13:39.777
The longer those planes

13:39.862 --> 13:41.651
stay connected,
the more danger everyone's in,

13:41.735 --> 13:43.476
so get going.

13:49.022 --> 13:50.413
Hey, Mac?

13:50.850 --> 13:51.773
If I don't make it...

13:51.867 --> 13:53.508
I get it.

13:53.592 --> 13:55.640
Things didn't end great
between us,

13:55.724 --> 13:57.676
but still I wouldn't
change a thing.

13:58.309 --> 14:00.268
I was gonna say "feed Basner."

14:01.665 --> 14:03.647
Who? We bought a parakeet

14:03.732 --> 14:05.730
and I got custody.
Long story.

14:19.702 --> 14:21.707
Asher?
Yeah.

14:21.924 --> 14:23.847
Just making sure
I had the right plane.

14:31.543 --> 14:33.026
Fear of heights kicking in?

14:33.447 --> 14:35.115
Please.

14:35.246 --> 14:37.158
It kicked in a long time ago.

14:42.850 --> 14:44.066
Mac.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.548
Remember when we went
bungee jumping

14:45.632 --> 14:47.474
off the bridge at Canyon Creek,
and you were too scared

14:47.558 --> 14:48.919
to jump and needed me
to push you off?

14:49.003 --> 14:51.869
I mean, I was 14.
I think that's pretty fair!

14:51.954 --> 14:53.698
Just saying, maybe someone

14:53.782 --> 14:55.263
can do that for you.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.324
Oh, please don't look at me.

14:57.409 --> 15:00.502
I hardly know you.
I'd never do something like that.

15:09.058 --> 15:11.148
Russ!

15:23.029 --> 15:24.164
How's it going up there?

15:24.248 --> 15:25.248
Don't ask!

15:42.248 --> 15:43.293
Whoa.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.191
That did not sound good.

15:51.275 --> 15:53.280
It's not.

15:53.428 --> 15:56.255
Uh, here, help me unhook it.

16:07.856 --> 16:09.359
It's no use.

16:09.496 --> 16:11.688
With these winds, we're
fighting too much force.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.601
A plane like this can't
handle this for long, Mac.

16:14.686 --> 16:16.862
It's gonna bring us down!

16:23.874 --> 16:25.773
Riley, give me some good news.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.345
It's all bad news.

16:29.242 --> 16:30.266
You need to get rid

16:30.350 --> 16:32.593
of that cable before it drags
the plane down.

16:33.164 --> 16:35.207
All right, look, maybe if I
find the right tools in here,

16:35.291 --> 16:36.648
I can knock it loose.

16:41.056 --> 16:42.582
Step aside.

16:50.497 --> 16:52.084
That works, too.

16:52.239 --> 16:54.067
Your girlfriend's awesome.

16:54.498 --> 16:56.326
- Not my girlfriend.
- Not his girlfriend.

17:08.608 --> 17:10.465
Okay,
we are down to 30 minutes of fuel.

17:10.550 --> 17:11.982
Matty, did you find us
an airport?

17:12.067 --> 17:13.873
I did,
but it's in Granite Pass.

17:13.958 --> 17:16.037
Unfortunately,
that airport is for jets only.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.465
Light aircraft are banned.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.248
- Why?
- It's in a canyon.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.654
High winds,
it's too turbulent.

17:20.739 --> 17:22.215
And as bad as things are,
if we try

17:22.300 --> 17:23.873
to land there,
we'll definitely crash.

17:23.958 --> 17:25.648
- We need another option.
- Working on it.

17:25.733 --> 17:27.085
Chaps, we have a missing door

17:27.169 --> 17:28.565
and we're running
low on fuel,

17:28.778 --> 17:30.654
so we'd better get this jet down
to Granite Pass or we're

17:30.738 --> 17:32.115
gonna be in trouble, too.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.778
See you on the ground,
I hope.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.693
Well, you were right.

17:40.778 --> 17:42.053
Your dad has a pulse,
but it's low.

17:42.137 --> 17:44.188
It's a little too low.

17:44.273 --> 17:45.950
You can save him, though.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.676
Right?

17:55.196 --> 17:57.498
Tell me that's not my radar.

17:57.583 --> 17:58.900
It was the A/C.

17:58.984 --> 18:01.715
Which you never let
me turn on anyways.

18:01.926 --> 18:04.165
If you didn't turn the bedroom
into a meat locker...

18:04.744 --> 18:06.943
Look, I'm about to use
the airplane's battery

18:07.028 --> 18:09.623
to charge these audio capacitors
to 600 volts.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.935
And then I'm gonna try and
shock his heartbeat back

18:12.020 --> 18:13.107
into a sinus rhythm.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.326
Human muscles
contract and expand

18:15.411 --> 18:17.560
based on electrical signals
from the nervous system.

18:17.645 --> 18:19.857
When those don't work,
we can trick a muscle,

18:19.942 --> 18:22.365
like the heart,
into getting back into rhythm.

18:22.450 --> 18:24.826
That's exactly what happens
with a defibrillator.

18:24.911 --> 18:26.927
I'm making a complete
electric circuit

18:27.012 --> 18:28.544
to run current
through his heart

18:28.629 --> 18:30.544
to get it beating
at a normal rate again.

18:32.368 --> 18:34.065
All right.

18:45.387 --> 18:46.739
Dad.

18:49.293 --> 18:51.295
Asher.

18:56.128 --> 18:57.132
Ben,

18:57.216 --> 18:59.841
my name is Mac,
your pilot is Desi.

18:59.926 --> 19:03.106
We are federal agents sent
here to get you home safe.

19:03.348 --> 19:05.571
H-How'd you get on my plane?

19:06.458 --> 19:09.770
It's a long story.
What do you remember?

19:13.004 --> 19:15.162
Fine a-at takeoff.

19:15.247 --> 19:18.075
Then... nothing.

19:18.487 --> 19:20.090
And I can't move my legs.

19:21.573 --> 19:23.551
I'm in his
company's medical records.

19:23.723 --> 19:26.315
No serious conditions or
risk factors for heart attack.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.333
No, I think
it's something else. Look.

19:31.325 --> 19:33.029
Okay, that wasn't there before.

19:33.114 --> 19:36.849
This rash could indicate
contact with a toxic substance.

19:36.934 --> 19:40.209
Have you ingested or
touched anything unusual

19:40.294 --> 19:41.450
in the last
24 hours?

19:41.535 --> 19:42.598
No.

19:42.737 --> 19:43.902
Airport hangars

19:43.987 --> 19:45.495
can have some gnarly chemicals.

19:45.738 --> 19:47.008
Riley?

19:47.496 --> 19:49.238
Scrubbing the hangar's
security footage.

19:49.332 --> 19:50.681
Stand by.

19:52.949 --> 19:54.598
Nothing out of the ordinary.

19:56.015 --> 19:58.152
Unless you count the mechanic.

20:01.871 --> 20:03.743
Oh, yeah.
Check this out.

20:07.613 --> 20:09.793
He went out of his way
to touch his arm.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.098
Yeah,
I thought that was weird.

20:12.190 --> 20:13.823
Right where the rash is.

20:14.066 --> 20:15.341
This was
no accident.

20:15.426 --> 20:17.098
That man poisoned you,
Ben.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.256
No.

20:18.340 --> 20:21.489
Look, this rash, slow pulse,
temporary paralysis,

20:21.574 --> 20:24.005
these symptoms are all
consistent with some poisons.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.888
And why would he wear gloves
doing paperwork

20:25.973 --> 20:28.114
if not to protect himself
from a dangerous substance?

20:28.199 --> 20:29.716
Ben, have you seen
this guy before?

20:29.801 --> 20:32.777
Never. U-Uh, why would
somebody do this?

20:32.862 --> 20:34.005
We'll figure that out later.

20:34.090 --> 20:35.778
Right now
we have a more urgent problem.

20:35.972 --> 20:37.958
Poisons require
specific antidotes.

20:38.043 --> 20:39.184
We've bought
Ben some time,

20:39.269 --> 20:41.177
but the poison's still running
through his bloodstream.

20:41.261 --> 20:42.693
Soon his vital organs
will shut down.

20:42.777 --> 20:44.512
Yeah, we need
to identify that poison.

20:44.597 --> 20:45.731
And to do that,

20:45.816 --> 20:47.567
we need to figure out
who poisoned him.

20:47.652 --> 20:49.880
Got it.
Talked to airport police.

20:49.965 --> 20:51.551
That mechanic used
his employee badge

20:51.636 --> 20:53.005
to go to departures
20 minutes ago.

20:53.090 --> 20:54.997
He's making his escape.
Find him.

20:55.082 --> 20:56.786
But don't engage
until backup arrives.

20:56.871 --> 20:57.809
On my way.

20:57.894 --> 20:59.793
Desi, I found you an airstrip

20:59.878 --> 21:03.128
on a small farm just 60 miles
from your current location.

21:03.246 --> 21:05.441
This is your best bet
for a safe landing.

21:06.737 --> 21:08.590
I'm texting you coordinates.

21:08.675 --> 21:10.436
Heading there now.

21:22.320 --> 21:23.636
Hey, Mac?

21:28.066 --> 21:29.409
How is he?

21:30.963 --> 21:32.222
Not great.

21:32.316 --> 21:35.222
But until we get the antidote,
there's nothing more we can do.

21:35.394 --> 21:36.886
Yeah.

21:37.984 --> 21:42.731
But since we do have some time,
maybe we should clear the air?

21:42.816 --> 21:45.285
I think it's fair to say
we are not fine.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.645
Look, I'm... I'm sorry, okay?

21:48.730 --> 21:50.856
It's just, it sucks
working with an ex.

21:50.941 --> 21:53.191
Well, we can at least act
like professionals.

21:53.276 --> 21:54.332
Great.

21:54.417 --> 21:56.285
And if we survive,
we'll discuss things,

21:56.410 --> 21:58.724
then resume avoiding each other
as much as humanly possible.

21:58.808 --> 22:01.449
Great. We can both agree
on something, then.

22:13.425 --> 22:15.215
Guys, this is a private airport.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.630
I can't get in
without a reservation,

22:16.714 --> 22:18.036
even with government clearance.

22:18.121 --> 22:20.176
Look, I fly through there
all the time.

22:20.261 --> 22:21.489
They get a lot of high rollers

22:21.574 --> 22:23.380
and more than a few travelers
with dubious records,

22:23.464 --> 22:25.177
so they're used to the
government trying to intercede.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.734
They will put you through hours
of red tape trying to get in.

22:27.964 --> 22:30.200
Let me guess.
You can do it faster.

22:30.285 --> 22:32.474
Give me 60 seconds.

22:36.682 --> 22:39.098
- <i>♪ Yeah, I got my shades on... ♪</i>
- 58 on the dot.

22:39.183 --> 22:41.059
Russ must have
some serious connections

22:41.144 --> 22:42.403
to hook me up like this.

22:42.488 --> 22:44.582
I could get used to it.

22:44.785 --> 22:46.100
- Don't.
- <i>♪ I feel good ♪</i>

22:46.566 --> 22:49.669
M <i>r. Sampson,
your flight is ready for takeoff.</i>

22:49.753 --> 22:51.942
Mr. Sampson,
your flight is ready...

22:52.027 --> 22:53.488
I got eyes on the mechanic.

22:53.746 --> 22:55.754
Looks like he just chartered
a private plane.

22:55.839 --> 22:57.660
He's getting out
of Dodge, Matty.

22:57.824 --> 22:59.411
Yeah, we have no legal authority

22:59.496 --> 23:00.668
to stall a private flight,

23:00.753 --> 23:02.287
and a court order
will take way too long.

23:02.371 --> 23:03.856
We'll have to go
after him ourselves.

23:03.941 --> 23:05.249
But wait for backup.

23:05.826 --> 23:08.028
- He's moments from boarding.
- <i>Bozer,</i>

23:08.113 --> 23:10.355
the man is dangerous,
probably armed

23:10.449 --> 23:12.262
and carrying a deadly poison.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.934
And if he gets away,
we'll never I.D. the antidote

23:15.019 --> 23:16.028
and Ben will die.

23:16.113 --> 23:18.262
We'll get him
when backup arrives.

23:18.347 --> 23:20.378
Bozer, you take him now.

23:20.604 --> 23:24.551
Uh, now seems like a good time
to ask: who's in charge?

23:24.636 --> 23:26.140
- Me.
- Me.

23:26.527 --> 23:28.663
Matty, without me,
there wouldn't even

23:28.771 --> 23:30.269
be funding for Phoenix.

23:31.394 --> 23:33.190
Hello?

23:33.275 --> 23:35.285
Hello?

23:36.536 --> 23:37.931
Did she just mute me?

23:38.675 --> 23:40.675
I'm sure it was
just an accident.

23:43.415 --> 23:45.184
Listen to me right now,
Bozer.

23:45.269 --> 23:47.075
We've get one shot at this.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.707
If you go after him alone
and fail,

23:48.792 --> 23:51.410
that man gets away
and Ben will die.

23:51.566 --> 23:53.081
Stand down.

23:55.316 --> 23:57.710
Standing down.

24:08.179 --> 24:10.511
I think my dad's
getting worse.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.919
Unfortunately,
there's not a whole lot we can do

24:14.003 --> 24:15.503
until we get that antidote.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.238
All right, guys,
we are on course to the farm airstrip.

24:18.323 --> 24:19.628
18 minutes.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.021
I'll alert police and fire

24:21.105 --> 24:23.450
to have emergency supplies
on hand. Copy that.

24:23.535 --> 24:25.496
Starting landing protocol.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.316
Well, that's weird.

24:29.705 --> 24:30.864
The Doppler's out.

24:30.949 --> 24:32.215
Uh, do we need it?

24:32.300 --> 24:34.379
No, but it could indicate
a larger issue.

24:34.464 --> 24:35.982
Mac, do me a favor
and lift up that rear panel,

24:36.066 --> 24:37.646
tell me what you see.Yeah.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.343
Uh, no need.
I know what the problem is.

24:46.428 --> 24:47.475
It's the landing gear.

24:47.673 --> 24:48.861
Well, what about it?

24:48.946 --> 24:50.344
We don't have any.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.016
How do we land

24:52.101 --> 24:53.461
without landing gear?

24:55.439 --> 24:57.441
You don't.

25:01.985 --> 25:04.954
Mac, Desi, you're only 40 miles
from the airstrip.

25:06.033 --> 25:07.515
Which gives us 15 minutes

25:07.599 --> 25:09.502
to figure out how to land this
without any landing gear.

25:09.586 --> 25:11.621
Yeah, well, fully aware.
Thanks for the added pressure.

25:11.705 --> 25:13.251
If you had a fix by now...

25:13.336 --> 25:14.827
Stop!

25:15.457 --> 25:17.372
You promised
to act professional.

25:18.086 --> 25:19.439
You heard that?

25:19.524 --> 25:20.960
Kids hear everything.

25:21.796 --> 25:23.220
You know what?
I, uh...

25:23.305 --> 25:24.431
I do have an idea.

25:24.516 --> 25:26.540
When planes
make emergency landings,

25:26.625 --> 25:28.145
the airport
will foam the runway.

25:28.229 --> 25:30.323
Russ, Riley,
where are you guys at?

25:33.459 --> 25:34.768
We just landed.

25:34.892 --> 25:36.667
But, Mac,
the airport's so small,

25:36.752 --> 25:37.785
there's not even a fire truck,

25:37.869 --> 25:39.034
let alone foam.Right.

25:39.119 --> 25:40.070
But they still have
to wash their planes,

25:40.157 --> 25:42.800
so there should be a truck there
with soaping agents,

25:42.885 --> 25:44.878
and I can walk you through
how to make that into a foam.

25:44.962 --> 25:46.480
Yeah, we'll get it.
Riley...

25:46.565 --> 25:48.878
Wait. We're gonna need
about 25 minutes.

25:48.963 --> 25:50.723
Desi, you're gonna have
to give us more time.

25:50.807 --> 25:53.034
Can't.
We only have 15 minutes of fuel.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.870
Unless Mac can magically
conjure up more.

25:56.025 --> 25:58.002
No, but we can run on air.

25:58.087 --> 25:59.226
I'm no scientist,

25:59.311 --> 26:00.589
but even I know
that's not possible.

26:00.673 --> 26:02.869
Yeah, it is, actually.
During long migrations,

26:02.954 --> 26:04.872
birds will find
a high altitude

26:04.957 --> 26:07.683
with strong air currents
that'll help them glide farther

26:07.768 --> 26:09.063
without wasting any energy.

26:09.291 --> 26:10.698
We can do that
exact same thing.

26:10.854 --> 26:12.136
Yeah, but a rapid climb

26:12.221 --> 26:13.301
would burn our remaining fuel

26:13.385 --> 26:14.982
and defeat the purpose.

26:15.158 --> 26:18.115
Unless you know some other way
of gaining altitude.

26:18.213 --> 26:19.408
I do.

26:21.111 --> 26:23.713
Fly straight
towards that mountain.

26:27.208 --> 26:29.602
Why did I ask?

26:36.191 --> 26:37.443
Matty, he's about to board.

26:37.527 --> 26:38.394
Where's my backup?

26:38.479 --> 26:39.746
They're held up
on the opposite side

26:39.830 --> 26:42.097
- of the airport. Moments away.
- If he gets on that flight,

26:42.181 --> 26:44.541
he's gone forever.
Ben's life depends on it.

26:44.751 --> 26:46.959
Sorry, Matty.
I can't wait.

26:47.671 --> 26:49.299
Bozer, don't!

26:54.801 --> 26:56.371
Hey!

27:13.543 --> 27:15.300
Police! Don't move.

27:16.525 --> 27:18.012
Matty, we got him.

27:19.533 --> 27:21.020
But I have a problem.

27:23.232 --> 27:24.817
He smashed a vial into my arm.

27:24.902 --> 27:26.357
Sending you a picture now.

27:26.442 --> 27:29.270
It's most likely
the same poison used on Ben.

27:29.355 --> 27:32.059
Now you both need
the antidote fast.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.426
We have the foaming chemicals,
and we're en route to the LZ.

27:40.511 --> 27:42.450
Airport police

27:42.535 --> 27:44.840
sent me the mechanic's
most recent texts.

27:44.925 --> 27:47.473
We don't have the exact name
of the person who hired him,

27:47.558 --> 27:49.215
but we do know
where they work:

27:49.680 --> 27:51.203
Ben's company.

27:54.028 --> 27:56.106
You inspect airplanes,
right?

27:56.297 --> 27:59.504
Yeah, um, for Maddock Aircraft.

27:59.918 --> 28:01.731
I approve plane designs

28:01.816 --> 28:03.153
before they can start
production.

28:03.238 --> 28:04.864
But why would somebody...?

28:06.854 --> 28:08.947
My God, the inspection report.

28:09.180 --> 28:10.293
Which report?

28:10.378 --> 28:13.122
We're launching
a new flagship jet.

28:13.786 --> 28:15.559
A lot riding on it.

28:16.413 --> 28:19.279
This week
I found a major engine flaw.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.942
It'll delay production
up to a year.

28:22.295 --> 28:23.909
- More.
- This can cost

28:23.994 --> 28:26.112
a publicly traded company
like yours a lot of money.

28:26.325 --> 28:27.676
Who else knew about this?

28:27.761 --> 28:29.426
Just the project manager.

28:30.129 --> 28:31.770
I told him
I'd send the report Monday.

28:31.861 --> 28:33.349
Yeah,
I'm already in Ben's work computer,

28:33.433 --> 28:35.220
but the contents
are a month old at least.

28:35.305 --> 28:37.457
His report's not here.
Someone must have deleted it.

28:37.606 --> 28:39.153
Well, it sounds
like a cover-up.

28:39.238 --> 28:41.668
The manager must have deleted it
to save his job.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.825
Then sent someone to kill Ben,

28:44.001 --> 28:45.551
make it look like an accident.

28:47.002 --> 28:49.387
I'll have police
pick up the manager.

28:51.145 --> 28:52.543
Ben, Asher,

28:52.628 --> 28:54.615
- I'm gonna need you to both strap in.
- In the meantime,

28:54.699 --> 28:56.312
I am looking at
another problem.

28:56.397 --> 28:58.918
- How are we gonna do this, Mac?
- Okay, when wind

28:59.003 --> 29:01.184
hits a mountain
with that shape,

29:01.269 --> 29:03.661
it diverts upward, creating
a fast air current.

29:03.973 --> 29:06.082
If we time it right,
we can ride that current

29:06.167 --> 29:08.037
to gain altitude without using
our remaining fuel.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.974
And the tailwinds
will keep us aloft long enough

29:10.058 --> 29:11.668
for Russ and Riley
to foam the runway.

29:11.753 --> 29:12.932
Theoretically.

29:13.017 --> 29:15.805
And if not...
well, you know.

29:16.153 --> 29:18.329
How did you learn how
to do all that stuff?

29:19.504 --> 29:21.903
My dad taught me,
actually.

29:23.558 --> 29:24.754
Okay.

29:24.839 --> 29:25.965
Here we go.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.715
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no! Not yet.

29:28.955 --> 29:30.240
Not yet. If you go too soon,
you're gonna miss the updraft.

29:30.324 --> 29:32.324
Yeah, well, too late
ain't gonna be so good either.

29:36.473 --> 29:38.054
Now? No, no.

29:38.138 --> 29:39.574
Not yet.

29:41.226 --> 29:43.358
Do not make me punch you,
Mac.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.356
Now!

29:47.549 --> 29:48.614
Whoa.

30:11.619 --> 30:13.276
We caught the current!

30:13.368 --> 30:15.286
Yeah. But
we're not on the ground yet.

30:15.721 --> 30:16.986
Russ, Riley,

30:17.079 --> 30:18.747
what's the ETA on that foam?

30:18.831 --> 30:20.633
Uh, we're three minutes away.

30:24.383 --> 30:25.777
What was that?

30:26.927 --> 30:28.061
Think someone hit us.

30:28.146 --> 30:29.453
We're all right.

30:38.646 --> 30:40.695
Hey. You hurt? You all right?

30:40.853 --> 30:42.898
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I just looked down at my phone.

30:42.983 --> 30:45.771
Hands-free, man.

30:46.081 --> 30:47.912
Our truck wasn't so fortunate.

30:47.997 --> 30:49.359
The release valve's broken.

30:51.771 --> 30:53.210
Mac, Desi,

30:53.474 --> 30:54.826
we have nothing
to foam the runway.

30:54.910 --> 30:57.612
Well, we're running out of
fuel. We have no choice.

30:57.696 --> 30:59.273
We're coming in
for a landing.

31:09.508 --> 31:10.742
Yeah, I-I checked, Mac.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.923
There's nothing else in the area
that can foam the airstrip.

31:13.007 --> 31:15.662
All we've got
is this useless truck.

31:16.387 --> 31:17.869
Wait, maybe not so useless.

31:18.015 --> 31:19.641
Here's what
I need you to do.

31:23.034 --> 31:23.994
What do you mean,

31:24.079 --> 31:25.437
"the truck will be
our landing gear"?

31:25.521 --> 31:28.071
Russ will match
our touchdown speed

31:28.156 --> 31:31.039
of 76 miles per hour,

31:31.172 --> 31:33.142
and we'll land on
top of you guys,

31:33.227 --> 31:34.667
thus preventing combustion

31:34.751 --> 31:36.312
- upon landing.
- Hold up.

31:36.397 --> 31:38.321
Go back to the part where
we land on top of them.

31:38.406 --> 31:40.499
Yeah, it's saner
than it sounds.

31:40.583 --> 31:42.016
Except it doesn't
sound sane at all.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.859
Okay.
When I connect this wire coil

31:43.944 --> 31:45.764
to the batteries from
the electrical system,

31:45.849 --> 31:47.188
it'll become an electromagnet.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.159
Thank you.
So,

31:49.243 --> 31:50.639
it'll magnetize the plane,

31:50.723 --> 31:52.025
and we'll stick to the top
of the truck,

31:52.109 --> 31:53.477
stabilizing us.

31:53.704 --> 31:56.362
- Does that make you feel better?
- No! No, it does not.

31:56.447 --> 31:58.735
Maybe you should, uh, get back
in your seat and buckle up.

31:58.820 --> 32:00.169
Okay.

32:14.442 --> 32:15.403
All right, Desi.

32:15.487 --> 32:16.752
We are at

32:16.836 --> 32:18.188
76 miles per hour.

32:18.272 --> 32:19.538
You can bring it in.

32:21.449 --> 32:22.494
Yup.

32:34.593 --> 32:36.682
Okay, that's not terrifying.

32:40.164 --> 32:41.255
Hurry up, Mac.

32:41.339 --> 32:43.036
We've only got one shot at this.

32:49.173 --> 32:50.304
Come on.

33:02.969 --> 33:03.969
Mac!

33:16.817 --> 33:18.277
It worked!

33:28.908 --> 33:30.279
Oh.

33:36.442 --> 33:38.081
Okay, I'd really like
to get out of the truck now.

33:38.165 --> 33:39.500
Mm-hmm,
yeah.

33:57.343 --> 33:58.547
Well,

33:58.632 --> 33:59.852
the antidote worked.

34:00.156 --> 34:01.407
Ben and Bozer
are on the mend,

34:01.492 --> 34:02.902
and, uh...

34:03.095 --> 34:04.640
it's all thanks to our team.

34:06.195 --> 34:08.289
So,
I just got off the phone with Matty,

34:08.373 --> 34:10.952
and the FAA reviewed
Ben's inspection report

34:11.036 --> 34:13.565
and ordered an immediate
halt to production.

34:13.649 --> 34:16.507
The mechanic as well
as the project manager

34:16.592 --> 34:18.178
are both in custody.

34:18.569 --> 34:21.322
Thank you all.
For everything.

34:22.487 --> 34:24.312
Mostly for saving Asher.

34:27.984 --> 34:29.937
I'm gonna get some water.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.460
What's going on?

34:44.179 --> 34:45.597
Nothing.

34:45.906 --> 34:47.632
Your dad's gonna be okay.

34:48.382 --> 34:49.989
I know.

34:51.492 --> 34:52.821
Seems like you got
something else

34:52.905 --> 34:54.195
that's on your mind.

34:54.609 --> 34:56.699
I wish he was around more.

35:02.498 --> 35:04.851
You know, when
I was your age,

35:04.957 --> 35:08.134
my dad, he was
gone a lot, too.

35:09.560 --> 35:12.784
It's not easy having a
father who saves the world.

35:13.468 --> 35:15.468
My dad checks airplanes.

35:15.649 --> 35:17.131
Exactly.

35:17.711 --> 35:19.453
He keeps people safe.

35:20.106 --> 35:22.155
But there's one person
he cares about keeping safe

35:22.239 --> 35:23.809
more than anyone
in the whole world,

35:24.057 --> 35:25.667
and it's you.

35:40.687 --> 35:42.218
Heard you wanted to see me?

35:42.632 --> 35:44.698
Yes. Yes, I thought
it'd be best

35:44.783 --> 35:46.421
if we met on neutral ground.

35:46.786 --> 35:48.397
I already know
what you're gonna say.

35:49.110 --> 35:51.960
I overrode your authority
and I muted your comm,

35:52.045 --> 35:54.572
which you hate,
'cause you like to talk.

35:54.793 --> 35:56.061
A lot.

35:56.318 --> 35:58.364
I won't apologize
for doing things my way,

35:58.449 --> 36:00.410
because I am good
at what I do.

36:00.741 --> 36:02.702
You're probably gonna
fire me. That's fine.

36:02.787 --> 36:03.787
You were right.

36:05.593 --> 36:06.874
If Bozer had waited

36:06.959 --> 36:08.679
another 30 seconds for backup,

36:09.710 --> 36:11.291
we would have caught
old what's-his-face

36:11.375 --> 36:13.108
and Bozer wouldn't
have almost died.

36:13.819 --> 36:16.241
You know, your expertise
is one of the big reasons

36:16.336 --> 36:17.906
I wanted Phoenix
in the first place.

36:17.990 --> 36:19.085
While I...

36:19.170 --> 36:20.952
I may not lack
self-confidence...

36:21.037 --> 36:22.500
That's...
what you call it.

36:22.585 --> 36:24.952
From now on,
when we're on a mission...

36:26.202 --> 36:27.702
...I want you

36:27.891 --> 36:29.601
to make the final call.

36:32.397 --> 36:33.963
Thank you.

36:35.679 --> 36:37.230
And even though
I never said it,

36:37.765 --> 36:39.795
thank you
for saving the Phoenix.

36:40.875 --> 36:42.233
My pleasure.

36:44.242 --> 36:47.843
This is my list of
operational requirements.

36:47.968 --> 36:49.763
It's new equipment,
guidelines,

36:49.848 --> 36:51.679
protocols. All in there.

36:51.999 --> 36:53.376
Hmm.

36:53.772 --> 36:55.248
Very well-played.

36:55.647 --> 36:56.788
You saw this coming.

36:56.873 --> 36:59.662
Yeah.
That's why you need me.

37:02.780 --> 37:05.226
You want to lay
everything on the table?

37:06.038 --> 37:07.215
You're exasperating,

37:07.300 --> 37:09.436
maddening,
and you drive me insane.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.132
Oh, tell me how
you really feel.

37:11.435 --> 37:14.354
But when things got dangerous,

37:14.601 --> 37:15.964
you were there for me.

37:16.194 --> 37:17.833
As you were for me.

37:19.982 --> 37:21.334
Maybe it's the adrenaline,

37:21.561 --> 37:24.022
but what we lacked
as a couple,

37:24.114 --> 37:25.444
we made up for
as partners.

37:25.536 --> 37:27.538
But we're more than that,
right?

37:29.025 --> 37:30.436
We were.

37:33.477 --> 37:35.772
The way things ended,
I, um...

37:36.212 --> 37:38.391
never really got
to tell you this,

37:38.943 --> 37:40.858
but I'm sorry.

37:41.452 --> 37:42.835
I failed you.

37:43.021 --> 37:45.061
You deserved a lot better.

37:47.513 --> 37:49.954
You said that better
than Phil Collins ever could.

37:50.327 --> 37:51.616
You're wrong about that.

37:51.701 --> 37:52.897
He's scientifically proven

37:52.989 --> 37:55.109
to be a master of the
human condition, so...

37:57.278 --> 37:59.358
I don't have a lot of friends.

38:00.986 --> 38:02.512
But you were the best.

38:02.597 --> 38:03.880
Then let's be that.

38:03.965 --> 38:06.249
Let's be that.
And if you could just work

38:06.334 --> 38:08.343
on your driving me insane thing,
that'd be cool.

38:08.428 --> 38:09.688
Mm, no promises.

38:09.773 --> 38:10.844
One more thing.

38:11.756 --> 38:12.860
As your friend,

38:12.945 --> 38:15.077
I need to give you
some tough love.

38:16.742 --> 38:18.375
Shoot.

38:20.024 --> 38:22.508
If you don't fix your
relationship with your father,

38:22.776 --> 38:24.774
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

38:27.140 --> 38:29.515
That's...
that's not up to me.

38:29.906 --> 38:31.046
That's on him.

38:31.131 --> 38:33.527
I mean, he broke everything
that we had, so...

38:33.612 --> 38:35.095
You need to let it go,
Mac.

38:35.387 --> 38:36.617
Your father
made a hard choice,

38:36.702 --> 38:37.793
but he made it for you.

38:37.948 --> 38:39.692
That's his only job in life.

38:39.917 --> 38:42.492
Not Phoenix
or some government op.

38:42.613 --> 38:44.354
You.

38:45.852 --> 38:47.297
I don't know...

38:47.857 --> 38:49.906
I don't know
how to fix things.

38:49.991 --> 38:51.256
You'll figure it out.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.126
You know how I know?

38:53.319 --> 38:54.571
'Cause you're MacGyver.

38:54.729 --> 38:56.313
It's what you do.

39:07.617 --> 39:09.332
<i>You're in luck.</i>

39:10.941 --> 39:12.639
