How'd you find me?

01:24.065 --> 01:26.298
Mom's been teaching me
how to track by scent.

01:26.346 --> 01:27.433
Pretty good, huh?

02:13.796 --> 02:15.353

up in the royal family.

make the journey

02:21.306 --> 02:22.892

I never had the chance.

02:26.570 --> 02:28.516
I don't have a brother or sister.

02:28.650 --> 02:31.384
And don't worry about
your Lion Guard duties, Kion.

02:31.486 --> 02:34.595
While you're gone,
I will be leading the Guard.

02:34.767 --> 02:35.868
You will?

02:35.916 --> 02:40.736
Perhaps your friends could learn
a thing or two from their King.

to meet their future Queen...

Kion usually goes this way.

07:05.329 --> 07:06.609
Is that so?

And is Kion here?

- No, sir.
- You heard the King.

Yes. "Fun."

will it take to get to Udugu?

10:05.847 --> 10:07.597
Thank you, Your Majesty.

10:07.687 --> 10:08.734
Thank you.

10:08.782 --> 10:12.308
To think our eggs were
personally saved by the King!

10:12.429 --> 10:14.129
What an honor!

10:14.902 --> 10:17.956
It was my pleasure, Mbuni.

10:18.136 --> 10:21.042
So, our first mission
was a success.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.662
Uh, yes, Your Majesty.

10:23.725 --> 10:24.943
- Yeah!
- Yep.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.951
Affirmative.

10:27.412 --> 10:30.802
KION: Is this really the trail to Udugu?
NALA: It is.

10:30.865 --> 10:32.561
If you tell us where Udugu is,

10:32.623 --> 10:34.614
I bet I can find an easier path.

10:34.670 --> 10:36.725
There is no easy path to Udugu.

10:36.787 --> 10:40.311
But there is a way to get through
all these thorns without a scratch.

10:40.459 --> 10:41.897
See?

10:41.982 --> 10:42.998
Yeah!

10:43.085 --> 10:46.053
I can crawl under the branches
to get through the thorns.

10:46.143 --> 10:48.076
Ow. (GRUNTS)

10:48.111 --> 10:49.441
Ouch!

10:49.542 --> 10:51.533
That wasn't exactly
what I meant.

10:51.581 --> 10:52.963
(CHUCKLES) Of course not.

10:53.011 --> 10:55.355
Over the thorns
is the way to go.

10:56.186 --> 10:57.933
(GRUNTS) Whoa!

10:57.981 --> 10:59.287
Ouch!

10:59.323 --> 11:02.190
I don't think either of you
is understanding me.

11:02.277 --> 11:03.894
What's wrong, Kiara?

11:03.942 --> 11:05.410
Isn't your... (GRUNTING)

11:05.490 --> 11:06.660
plan working?

11:06.708 --> 11:07.949
I'm... Ow!

11:08.002 --> 11:09.184
Fine.

11:09.232 --> 11:10.949
I know exactly... (YELPS)

11:10.997 --> 11:12.228
what I'm doing.

11:12.290 --> 11:13.907
I hope they make it.

11:14.071 --> 11:16.267
This is definitely... (GRUNTS)

11:16.337 --> 11:17.704
the right way, Kiara.

11:17.798 --> 11:20.433
I'm almost through!

11:20.519 --> 11:22.191
And I'm almost at the branch.

11:22.239 --> 11:24.409
After that it'll be...
(GROANS)

11:24.480 --> 11:26.480
easy!
Right, Mom?

11:26.612 --> 11:27.612
Mom?

11:27.730 --> 11:28.950
Mom?

11:28.986 --> 11:31.052
(BOTH GROANING AND GRUNTING)

11:39.129 --> 11:40.620
BOTH: Mom?

11:42.097 --> 11:45.214
Now they're truly on
the Trail to Udugu.

11:45.302 --> 11:47.847
SIMBA: That was so exciting.

11:48.171 --> 11:50.800
Your first rescue with the King.

11:51.456 --> 11:54.956
I wonder what our next
challenge will be.

11:55.808 --> 11:58.346
Well, let's go, Lion Guard.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.354
At least he's not mad at us
for almost losing that egg.

12:01.402 --> 12:02.581
Why should he be?

12:02.644 --> 12:05.519
It's not your fault
you can't jump like a lion.

12:05.589 --> 12:09.308
What's the point of being a team if
we're all gonna do the same thing?

12:09.402 --> 12:11.831
Fuli, he's the King!

12:11.941 --> 12:14.269
He's gotta know what he's doing.

12:14.348 --> 12:15.514
Doesn't he?

12:15.573 --> 12:19.011
Maybe we just need to do it
more Simba's way?

12:19.059 --> 12:21.236
Everyone!
Everyone!

12:21.417 --> 12:23.597
The gazelles... The
gazelles need our help!

12:23.661 --> 12:25.847
Lion Guard, follow me!

12:26.659 --> 12:30.058
(SIGHS) That's what I was
going to say...

12:30.620 --> 12:31.988
KIARA: Mom?

12:32.054 --> 12:33.054
Mom!

12:34.331 --> 12:36.738
No sign of Mom on my side.

12:36.807 --> 12:38.620
Have you found anything?

12:39.350 --> 12:40.738
Kion?

12:42.259 --> 12:43.659
Nothing over here.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.339
(SIGHS SOFTLY)
How could she just disappear?

12:47.297 --> 12:48.738
Mom!

12:49.266 --> 12:50.494
We'll find her.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.400
We just have to keep looking.

12:52.436 --> 12:53.807
Try your side again.

12:53.855 --> 12:55.652
I tried my side.

12:55.722 --> 12:57.659
If she was there
I'd have seen her.

12:57.816 --> 13:00.141
I know, I just...

13:00.253 --> 13:01.956
I can't find her either.

13:02.004 --> 13:04.933
If we knew where
this Udugu place was,

13:04.988 --> 13:07.050
maybe we could meet her there.

13:07.150 --> 13:09.347
Or we could track her.

13:09.511 --> 13:11.953
(SNIFFING)

13:12.206 --> 13:13.409
Got her!

13:13.527 --> 13:14.447
She went this way.

13:14.495 --> 13:15.870
Come on!

13:18.962 --> 13:19.962
(KIARA SNIFFS)

13:20.441 --> 13:21.441
Kiara, look!

13:21.489 --> 13:22.972
Paw prints.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.480
They look fresh.

13:25.808 --> 13:27.268
We must be getting close.

13:27.460 --> 13:28.503
Come on.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.596
(SNIFFING)

13:32.793 --> 13:33.808
What?

13:33.894 --> 13:35.604
They just stop right here?

13:35.652 --> 13:37.050
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

13:37.128 --> 13:38.886
Where did Mom go?

13:41.770 --> 13:44.300
The gazelles are just
over the next ridge.

13:45.989 --> 13:47.136
There!

13:50.183 --> 13:53.909
Swala and the other gazelles must be
looking for a route up to that grassland.

13:54.003 --> 13:56.003
But those rocks...
They're unstable.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.542
The rocks will fall if
the gazelles jump on them.

13:58.597 --> 14:01.468
Lion Guard, follow me!

14:01.686 --> 14:05.206
Should we remind him how easily
gazelles spook when they're surprised?

14:05.350 --> 14:07.930
Nah! Simba knows
what he's doing.

14:07.978 --> 14:09.640
It'll be fine.

14:14.439 --> 14:15.577
What's that?

14:17.087 --> 14:18.119
Something's coming!

14:18.155 --> 14:19.333
ALL: (PANICKED)
Something's coming!

14:19.380 --> 14:21.213
Something's coming!
Something's coming!

14:22.125 --> 14:23.381
They're spooked.

14:23.483 --> 14:25.233
Now we really need to hurry.

14:25.362 --> 14:27.436
Lion Guard, follow me!

14:30.967 --> 14:32.200
(GROUND RUMBLING)

14:35.320 --> 14:36.452
Everyone, stop!

14:36.517 --> 14:38.217
The cliff is collapsing!

14:39.475 --> 14:41.319
Ono, warn Simba!

14:41.485 --> 14:42.741
Affirmative!

14:54.428 --> 14:56.228
(GASPS) Oh, no!

14:56.340 --> 14:57.725
Simba!

14:58.425 --> 14:59.631
Your Majesty?

15:00.203 --> 15:01.405
Simba!

15:01.965 --> 15:04.600
(SIMBA COUGHING)

15:04.899 --> 15:06.799
Good to see you, Ono.

15:06.937 --> 15:08.069
Your Majesty!

15:08.104 --> 15:10.371
Everyone, he's over here.

15:10.631 --> 15:11.991
Are you all right?

15:12.075 --> 15:13.107
I'm okay.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.834
Just a little stuck.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.348
This can't be right.

15:19.441 --> 15:22.016
Mom couldn't just disappear.

15:22.052 --> 15:23.574
I don't get it.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.143
We followed her trail.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.957
How can it just end?

15:27.090 --> 15:28.543
Maybe it doesn't.

15:28.731 --> 15:31.238
There's a ledge and a trail.

15:32.314 --> 15:34.551
I bet Mom jumped up there.

15:35.082 --> 15:36.231
Then we will too.

15:36.266 --> 15:37.473
Ready?

15:37.535 --> 15:39.968
One, two, three!

15:41.734 --> 15:43.124
(BOTH GRUNTING)

15:43.398 --> 15:44.874
Not even close.

15:45.007 --> 15:47.499
If Mom could get up there,
we can too.

15:47.585 --> 15:50.144
Mom's twice our size, Kion.

15:50.195 --> 15:53.179
How can we keep tracking her
if we can't jump up?

15:53.382 --> 15:54.679
I've got it!

15:54.773 --> 15:58.070
I'll give you a boost, then
you can keep tracking her.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.499
But what about you?

15:59.570 --> 16:01.687
One of us has
to boost the other,

16:01.820 --> 16:03.843
and the truth is...

16:04.273 --> 16:05.859
You're the better tracker.

16:05.962 --> 16:07.507
I won't argue that.

16:07.585 --> 16:11.232
Though you're the one who saw the
tracks and figured out Mom jumped.

16:11.390 --> 16:13.201
So we make a good team.

16:13.343 --> 16:14.960
And that's how we'll find Mom,

16:15.071 --> 16:16.874
by working together.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.929
Now up you go.

16:19.042 --> 16:20.375
(STRAINING)

16:22.112 --> 16:24.684
Whoa!
I gotcha! Hang on.

16:25.048 --> 16:26.915
(STRAINING)

16:27.066 --> 16:28.770
Just a little closer.

16:31.176 --> 16:32.387
How's that?

16:32.435 --> 16:34.997
(STRAINING) I think
I'm gonna make it.

16:35.486 --> 16:37.267
Yes! (PANTING)

16:37.681 --> 16:39.157
We did it!

16:40.329 --> 16:42.915
(GASPS) I don't believe it.

16:43.066 --> 16:45.133
Kiara, what's going on?

16:46.036 --> 16:47.650
Hello down there.

16:48.521 --> 16:50.626
(CHUCKLES) Mom!

16:54.873 --> 16:57.275
Mom, why did you disappear?

16:57.368 --> 16:59.954
I thought you were gonna
show us the way to Udugu.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.001
Actually, I think you've
already found Udugu.

17:03.509 --> 17:04.884
We have?

17:04.992 --> 17:06.320
Is it that big rock?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.631
No, Kion.

17:07.689 --> 17:09.775
Come on down, Kiara,
and I'll explain.

17:09.852 --> 17:11.954
Uh, okay.

17:13.128 --> 17:15.884
You see, kids,
Udugu isn't a place.

17:16.031 --> 17:18.814
Udugu is another word
for kinship.

17:18.978 --> 17:21.634
It's the special bond
between siblings.

17:21.790 --> 17:26.140
You found Udugu when you decided
to work together to look for me.

17:26.203 --> 17:28.078
- We did?
- Yes.

17:28.157 --> 17:30.657
And I'm very proud of you.

17:32.042 --> 17:34.493
Un-Bunga-lievable.

17:34.556 --> 17:36.337
You're one lucky lion.

17:36.415 --> 17:38.152
You could have gotten smushed.

17:38.212 --> 17:40.021
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

17:40.056 --> 17:41.212
We'll get you free.

17:41.272 --> 17:42.696

17:58.074 --> 17:59.859
Sorry. I thought
you were going to say it.

17:59.907 --> 18:00.853
The gazelles!

18:00.901 --> 18:03.728
They're stampeding straight for
the ostriches and their nest!

Bad day to be an ostrich egg.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.485
Your Majesty, what do we do?

18:07.603 --> 18:09.083
You have to stop the gazelles.

18:09.157 --> 18:10.314
And leave you here?

18:10.446 --> 18:12.985
I'll be fine.

Thanks, Fuli.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.203
Thank Ono.
He saw the boulder.

18:24.251 --> 18:26.067
We all try to do
what we do best.

18:26.102 --> 18:27.946
That's why we're a great team.

18:28.038 --> 18:30.104
That is why, isn't it?

18:30.140 --> 18:32.204
We can't leave Simba here.
It's not safe.

18:32.282 --> 18:34.400
But he told us to go
after the gazelles.

All day I've been telling you
to follow me, and do what I do.

But that's not how
your team works.

18:42.868 --> 18:43.953
So tell me.

If I were Kion,
how would you handle this?

18:47.650 --> 18:48.806

Ono and I would go
after the herd.

18:50.610 --> 18:52.689
Beshte and Bunga
would stay to free you.

20:11.207 --> 20:12.584
Don't worry, Your Highness.

20:12.701 --> 20:15.076
We'll have you
out of there in no time.

20:15.111 --> 20:16.216
(SOFTLY) Careful, Big B.

20:16.264 --> 20:19.052
If you let the boulder roll the
wrong way it'll squish him.

20:19.115 --> 20:22.283
Bunga, you know
I can hear you, right?

20:22.490 --> 20:25.676
Uh, sure, I knew that.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.701
- Did you know that?
- Yep.

20:27.763 --> 20:30.258
BESHTE: <i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

20:30.326 --> 20:32.302
(BESHTE GRUNTS)
All clear!

20:33.363 --> 20:35.229
(RUMBLING)

20:37.255 --> 20:38.366
BUNGA: Uh-oh.

20:38.556 --> 20:40.912
Let's get out of here!

20:45.591 --> 20:47.880
(ALL PANTING)
Whoo!

20:48.044 --> 20:50.912
That was un-Bunga-lievable!

20:51.022 --> 20:52.077
I kinda wanna do it again.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.025
Nice job, guys.

20:54.150 --> 20:56.998
Simba's safe, and so are
the gazelles and ostriches.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.506
That's because
you did it your way.

20:59.631 --> 21:01.189
Kion would be proud of you.

21:01.358 --> 21:03.717
And so am I.

21:06.381 --> 21:08.998
So, everyone,
how was your journey?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.435
Did you find Udugu?

21:11.576 --> 21:12.787
We found it.

21:12.866 --> 21:14.101
But it's not really a place.

21:14.202 --> 21:17.608
It's about us working together
as brother and sister.

21:17.739 --> 21:19.139
As a team.

21:20.310 --> 21:22.311
How did things go
with the Guard?

21:22.373 --> 21:24.139
Well, in a way,

21:24.225 --> 21:27.131
the Guard helped me
find Udugu, too.

21:27.256 --> 21:28.608
It's an important lesson.

21:28.694 --> 21:32.553
It is, especially for you two.

21:36.092 --> 21:38.125
And as Queen of the Pride Lands

21:38.264 --> 21:40.127
and leader of the Lion Guard,

21:40.241 --> 21:43.975
someday you will be
responsible for all of this.

21:50.241 --> 21:52.295
So hold on to what
you learned today.

21:52.397 --> 21:55.397
Then you'll always have Udugu.
