WEBVTT

00:04.299 --> 00:06.219
Previously
on "Future Man"...

00:07.890 --> 00:09.475
Get the fuck back
to the future

00:09.476 --> 00:11.479
and do not come back for me
no matter what.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.899
I guess we should
say something.

00:12.900 --> 00:15.153
Though his worldly body
was incinerated,

00:15.154 --> 00:16.782
I take comfort in knowing that

00:16.783 --> 00:18.827
is has become
one with the elements.

00:18.828 --> 00:20.330
Except for his cock.

00:20.331 --> 00:21.959
That was once
a cause of great shame.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.587
I will wear it with pride.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.550
He's got two GS-39
hand cannon wounds.

00:25.551 --> 00:27.177
- That's no stray.
- That's Torque.

00:27.178 --> 00:29.557
- Weasel.
- Who you calling "Weasel"?

00:29.558 --> 00:31.269
- It's your name.
- My name is Wrench.

00:31.270 --> 00:33.147
And there's no outsiders
allowed in the NAG.

00:33.148 --> 00:34.609
It's Tiger.
I'm with Wolf.

00:34.610 --> 00:36.656
That's Torque.

00:40.371 --> 00:41.497
I see eye flutter.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.459
There he is.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.838
Welcome back, Torque.

00:44.839 --> 00:46.048
Your hair looks insane.

00:46.049 --> 00:48.344
I want to hear that story.

00:48.345 --> 00:51.058
Torque, can you hear me?

00:54.232 --> 00:55.317
Are you with us?

00:55.318 --> 00:57.864
- Tiger.
- Where's Tiger?

00:57.865 --> 00:59.283
He's talking about
this tiger again.

00:59.284 --> 01:00.745
He's delirious.

01:00.746 --> 01:01.872
Don't worry.

01:01.873 --> 01:03.917
The tiger can't get you anymore.

01:05.547 --> 01:07.174
Oh, I have to go find her.

01:07.175 --> 01:09.011
- Whoa, whoa, no-no-no.
- Ow!

01:09.012 --> 01:11.349
Don't even think about it.

01:11.350 --> 01:14.147
We're gonna
take good care of you.

01:17.905 --> 01:21.118
Who are you people?

01:21.119 --> 01:22.955
Where the hell am I?

01:22.956 --> 01:24.626
You're home.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.713
- You made it home.
- In the sewer?

01:26.714 --> 01:28.884
- Huh.
- He thinks we live in the sewer.

01:28.885 --> 01:31.389
Well, the way you people treat
this house, I don't blame him.

01:31.390 --> 01:33.267
We've been out of the sewer
for 20 years.

01:33.268 --> 01:35.523
- We live in the NAG now.
- The New Above Ground.

01:35.524 --> 01:36.942
It's paradise.

01:36.943 --> 01:38.027
Oh, no.

01:38.028 --> 01:39.446
He's got the sand brain.

01:40.617 --> 01:42.035
Don't you remember anything?

01:42.036 --> 01:43.539
Were you kidnapped by
the Sno-Mads?

01:43.540 --> 01:44.916
Forced into the
Fighting Pits of Goleta?

01:44.917 --> 01:46.628
Don't be absurd, Lathe.

01:46.629 --> 01:48.590
Those scars could only be
from a Bio-Tech NecroHangar.

01:48.591 --> 01:51.429
They swear they shut those down
after the armistice.

01:51.430 --> 01:52.890
I'm burning with rage.

01:52.891 --> 01:56.565
Do you at least remember
how you escaped?

01:56.566 --> 01:58.986
Uh.

01:58.987 --> 02:01.658
I was a prisoner...

02:01.659 --> 02:02.827
of the Biotics?

02:02.828 --> 02:04.455
- Correct.
- The Bio-Techs.

02:04.456 --> 02:07.419
Bio-Techs.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.755
How long was I gone?

02:08.756 --> 02:10.300
Two years.

02:10.301 --> 02:11.511
We thought you were dead.

02:11.512 --> 02:12.638
But you came back to us.

02:15.019 --> 02:17.565
I'm in a different reality.

02:17.566 --> 02:19.318
Can you remember anything?

02:19.319 --> 02:23.034
Anything at all?

02:23.035 --> 02:25.455
Only that they tortured me
pretty good.

02:25.456 --> 02:27.209
Oh, Torque.

02:27.210 --> 02:32.302
Needles, drugs, a white powder
they forced up my nose.

02:32.303 --> 02:34.766
It made me lose my mind,

02:34.767 --> 02:36.728
and be excessively chatty.

02:36.729 --> 02:41.445
After a year, I--
I almost forgot who I was.

02:41.446 --> 02:43.157
They took me to the Viper Room.

02:43.158 --> 02:45.579
Oh, the noise alone.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.873
The shredding.

02:46.874 --> 02:48.961
- The face-melting.
- Oh...

02:48.962 --> 02:52.175
All at the hands
of my tormentor,

02:52.176 --> 02:53.177
Slash.

02:53.178 --> 02:54.722
- Oh.
- "Slash"?

02:54.723 --> 02:59.439
So, uh, did we win?

02:59.440 --> 03:03.657
The war against the Biotic--
B--Bio-Techs?

03:03.658 --> 03:05.118
- We didn't lose.
- We survived.

03:05.119 --> 03:06.580
4% of us.

03:06.581 --> 03:09.544
You don't remember
any of this?

03:09.545 --> 03:10.796
There's a truce.

03:10.797 --> 03:12.592
The Bio-Tech robot emperor

03:12.593 --> 03:14.344
prophesized
the end of the world.

03:14.345 --> 03:16.181
They think life on Earth
is about to end

03:16.182 --> 03:18.269
because of--
you ready for this?

03:18.270 --> 03:20.064
Man-made climate change.

03:22.445 --> 03:24.323
It is pretty hot out there.

03:24.324 --> 03:26.201
Uh, humans have been around
since the time of the dinosaurs.

03:26.202 --> 03:29.458
I think we can handle
a little hot weather.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.295
They're building
these crazy space-wagons

03:31.296 --> 03:33.049
to go live on a sky sparkle.

03:33.050 --> 03:36.055
Those only exist for, like,
12 hours a day, dummies.

03:38.393 --> 03:40.229
- Hey, hey!
- No laughter!

03:40.230 --> 03:42.025
Everyone knows
that's the worst medicine.

03:42.026 --> 03:44.030
Good, the doctor's here.

03:47.579 --> 03:49.206
This is healing quite nicely.

03:49.207 --> 03:51.126
I am a little worried
about infection though.

03:51.127 --> 03:53.422
But this should help.

03:55.344 --> 03:56.805
Needs a little more.

03:58.601 --> 04:00.646
Don't squirm, otherwise
the medicine won't take.

04:00.647 --> 04:02.357
What is it?

04:02.358 --> 04:04.403
This particular combo is
Lady Fern,

04:04.404 --> 04:06.115
Blood Flower, and tongue sweat.

04:06.116 --> 04:08.662
Medicine don't come
much more powerful than that.

04:08.663 --> 04:10.666
Let the doctor work.
She knows what she's doing.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.168
Does she?

04:12.169 --> 04:13.797
- You know what?
- Rest is the last thing you need.

04:13.798 --> 04:15.884
We need to force movement,
get the blood flowing

04:15.885 --> 04:17.387
to those wounds
while they're still open.

04:17.388 --> 04:18.974
Let's go.
Get him up, get him up!

04:18.975 --> 04:20.309
- I really don't want to move.
- Get him up!

04:20.310 --> 04:21.437
Get him up.

04:21.438 --> 04:23.399
- Ow!
- Up we go.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.529
- We got you.
- Come on, big guy.

04:25.530 --> 04:27.533
Don't worry.
Here we go.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.286
That's the sound of healing.

04:37.637 --> 04:39.807
Ah.

04:39.808 --> 04:42.521
Does any of this
look familiar?

04:42.522 --> 04:44.191
This is our, uh...

04:44.192 --> 04:45.944
Cluster home.

04:45.945 --> 04:49.367
- Yeah, right.
- Cluster.

04:49.368 --> 04:52.373
Okay, okay.

04:52.374 --> 04:53.334
So...

04:56.341 --> 04:57.676
Oh, shit.

04:57.677 --> 04:59.806
Okay, so as you know,

04:59.807 --> 05:01.768
memory's a little scattered

05:01.769 --> 05:03.814
because of the--
well, the torture

05:03.815 --> 05:05.859
and the being held a prisoner

05:05.860 --> 05:08.740
and all those things
that definitely happened, so,

05:08.741 --> 05:11.913
I'm just gonna come out and ask.

05:11.914 --> 05:15.086
Which one of you cats
am I married to?

05:15.087 --> 05:16.549
Wow.

05:24.355 --> 05:27.026
- What did I say?
- Who did I offend?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.697
It's all of us, Torque.

05:28.698 --> 05:32.663
You're married to all of us.

05:32.664 --> 05:35.418
Papa's back!

05:35.419 --> 05:37.005
Uh, oh.

05:37.006 --> 05:38.800
For the love of Festivus,
please tell us

05:38.801 --> 05:39.844
you remember our daughter?

05:43.351 --> 05:44.605
Uh...

05:50.449 --> 05:51.868
We don't know
what kind of sorcery

05:51.869 --> 05:53.454
the Bio-Techs are up to
over there.

05:53.455 --> 05:54.916
They could have perfected
the art of the face-lift.

05:54.917 --> 05:55.918
- Impossible.
- We would see the scars.

05:55.919 --> 05:57.253
That's Torque.

05:57.254 --> 05:58.965
Can I be
the voice of reason here?

05:58.966 --> 06:00.677
- Of course, Level.
- Time.

06:00.678 --> 06:02.973
When I was captured by
the Hill People of Calabasas

06:02.974 --> 06:05.896
and forced to watch
my previous cluster eaten alive,

06:05.897 --> 06:08.108
the only thing that
brought me back to my old self

06:08.109 --> 06:09.904
was time.

06:09.905 --> 06:12.576
Now look at me.
I'm thriving.

06:12.577 --> 06:15.206
Torque doesn't have
half your fortitude, Level.

06:15.207 --> 06:17.544
If we give him time, he'll
just worm his way into our lives

06:17.545 --> 06:19.339
and drown us in a flood of lies.

06:29.277 --> 06:31.781
You did these?

06:31.782 --> 06:34.452
Mama Thimble says I can be
an artist when I grow up,

06:34.453 --> 06:37.584
as long as I don't
have to be a provider.

06:37.585 --> 06:39.588
Which one's Thimble?

06:41.134 --> 06:43.053
- That one.
- Mama Teacher.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.974
Huh.

06:44.975 --> 06:46.393
Well, don't listen to her.

06:46.394 --> 06:48.147
You know, my buddy
Bobby Mapplethorpe

06:48.148 --> 06:50.192
told me I had the best eye
he'd ever seen.

06:50.193 --> 06:53.157
This shit is fucking good.

06:53.158 --> 06:55.996
Was Bobby Mapplethorpe someone
you met while you were away?

06:55.997 --> 06:59.002
Yeah. Yeah,
as a matter of fact, he was.

06:59.003 --> 07:00.421
Shit.

07:00.422 --> 07:01.924
The hell are these pictures
back here?

07:01.925 --> 07:03.343
- That's you.
- That's what I imagined

07:03.344 --> 07:04.764
you were doing
while you were gone.

07:04.765 --> 07:06.349
Now that you're back,

07:06.350 --> 07:08.730
I don't have to use
my imagination anymore.

07:13.616 --> 07:16.871
Look, don't put your imagination
on ice just yet, okay?

07:18.876 --> 07:22.716
You know, being an artist
can be useful in other ways.

07:22.717 --> 07:24.804
- Like how?
- Well.

07:24.805 --> 07:27.391
You know, I'm kind of having
a hard time remembering the NAG.

07:27.392 --> 07:31.149
So how about you draw me a map?

07:31.150 --> 07:32.569
Just to help me remember things.

07:32.570 --> 07:35.700
Yeah, I can do that,
Papa Torque.

07:35.701 --> 07:37.495
- All right.
- And, hey.

07:37.496 --> 07:40.042
Don't forget all the gates
and entrances and exits.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.046
You know, fun stuff like that.

07:42.047 --> 07:45.011
Knock yourself out, squirt.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.891
Look at this guy!

07:47.892 --> 07:49.435
Leaves must be working.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.273
Always do.

07:51.274 --> 07:52.693
- I got this.
- Thanks.

07:52.694 --> 07:53.987
Whoa, what--
what you doing, buddy?

07:53.988 --> 07:55.699
I'm gonna make
myself some grub.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.953
This enormo-bean has potential.

07:57.954 --> 08:00.792
Uh, it's an All-Bean
and let--

08:00.793 --> 08:02.253
let me do that for you.

08:02.254 --> 08:05.176
Oh, I'm pretty good
in the kitchen.

08:05.177 --> 08:07.931
Uh, it's kind of my job here,

08:07.932 --> 08:10.186
kind of what I do,
exclusively.

08:10.187 --> 08:11.856
Yeah, why don't we
go find a seat?

08:11.857 --> 08:13.275
Meh.

08:13.276 --> 08:15.321
So what?

08:15.322 --> 08:17.701
Everyone here has a--
a role or something?

08:17.702 --> 08:21.291
- Yeah.
- So I'm Mama Teacher.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.794
- Thimble.
- Right.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.882
- Yeah.
- I am Thimble.

08:24.883 --> 08:27.094
Let me guess, uh,

08:27.095 --> 08:28.806
you're our cooking dad?

08:28.807 --> 08:31.394
- Lathe.
- And housekeeper.

08:31.395 --> 08:34.610
And anything else that
goes undone around here.

08:34.611 --> 08:36.739
Eh.

08:36.740 --> 08:39.578
Hatchet over there,
he's our resident hard-ass.

08:39.579 --> 08:40.997
Disciplinarian.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.333
And don't talk
with your mouth full.

08:42.334 --> 08:44.588
Goes for all of you.
It's gross.

08:44.589 --> 08:46.091
And you're the schedule nerd,

08:46.092 --> 08:48.053
just making sure
all the rest of these yahoos

08:48.054 --> 08:49.430
are where they're supposed to be

08:49.431 --> 08:50.850
when they're
supposed to be there.

08:50.851 --> 08:52.896
- You get me, Torque.
- You always have.

08:52.897 --> 08:55.150
- Hey, Torque.
- Do me.

08:55.151 --> 08:57.405
You just seem like
a big ole bag of fun.

08:57.406 --> 09:00.704
Just hanging out, not doing
a whole lot of anything.

09:00.705 --> 09:02.833
We all really try to do
our job

09:02.834 --> 09:04.460
and our job only.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.047
Even though some jobs
are harder

09:06.048 --> 09:08.010
and larger
and you never get breaks.

09:08.011 --> 09:09.888
And he wouldn't have it
any other way.

09:09.889 --> 09:10.890
Of course I would.

09:10.891 --> 09:12.018
My job is 50 times harder

09:12.019 --> 09:14.355
than anything you people do.

09:14.356 --> 09:16.359
Could you at least

09:16.360 --> 09:19.324
lick the bowl clean before
you put it back on the shelf?

09:19.325 --> 09:22.623
- Okay.
- What's my deal?

09:22.624 --> 09:25.712
- You're our provider.
- You make wheels.

09:25.713 --> 09:27.173
Pretty average wheels.

09:27.174 --> 09:29.385
- Huh.
- I'm a wheel-maker.

09:29.386 --> 09:31.515
Do you know what these are?

09:31.516 --> 09:34.228
Uh, well,

09:34.229 --> 09:36.859
yeah, I do, but

09:36.860 --> 09:38.655
I'm kind of afraid to say.

09:38.656 --> 09:40.449
The chits, Torque.

09:40.450 --> 09:41.994
The chits.

09:41.995 --> 09:44.165
They're how we pay for things
around here.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.879
And as you can see,

09:46.880 --> 09:48.925
the chitty kitty's nearly empty.

09:48.926 --> 09:50.469
Huh.

09:50.470 --> 09:51.555
We're gonna need you
to go back to work.

09:51.556 --> 09:54.687
But only when you're up to it.

09:54.688 --> 09:57.859
You mean,
up to it like this?

09:57.860 --> 09:59.697
Oh, hey.

09:59.698 --> 10:02.284
Look.

10:02.285 --> 10:04.455
I'm ready to go back now.

10:04.456 --> 10:07.294
Oh, I can't wait
to go back to that,

10:07.295 --> 10:09.424
- um...
- Wheel shop?

10:09.425 --> 10:11.469
Yes, Thimble.

10:11.470 --> 10:14.685
Yes.
My beloved wheel shop.

10:14.686 --> 10:15.687
Oh...

10:15.688 --> 10:18.943
Yee!

10:35.477 --> 10:37.689
Where do you think you're
going without a good-bye kiss?

10:55.433 --> 10:58.230
Please, don't get eaten.

10:58.231 --> 11:01.361
- Oh, God.
- I've been quintuple-rat-holed.

11:01.362 --> 11:04.743
- Not so fast.
- I'm taking Lugnut to school.

11:04.744 --> 11:06.705
- We can drop you at the shop.
- Oh, nah.

11:06.706 --> 11:08.793
With a recovery like that,
who knows, maybe,

11:08.794 --> 11:10.212
you'll be ready for The Sowing.

11:10.213 --> 11:11.549
That's right.

11:11.550 --> 11:12.884
Sure would be nice
to have you back,

11:12.885 --> 11:14.345
if you're up to it.

11:14.346 --> 11:15.932
Yeah-yeah, sure, I'm fine.

11:15.933 --> 11:17.101
Ready to sow.

11:17.102 --> 11:19.231
Yes!

11:20.901 --> 11:22.821
Oh--wait up.

11:27.205 --> 11:29.835
- So what's the deal?
- We live in a quarry?

11:29.836 --> 11:32.716
Away from the Bio-Techs'
prying eyes.

11:32.717 --> 11:35.638
Half now and half when
we deliver it to your cluster.

11:35.639 --> 11:37.851
Folks, step right up.

11:40.816 --> 11:42.944
Do all the kids around
here have six parents?

11:42.945 --> 11:45.575
Seems fucking bananas.

11:45.576 --> 11:47.662
You should come to school
with me, Papa Torque.

11:47.663 --> 11:48.956
That'll help your memory.

11:48.957 --> 11:50.334
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.837
Why don't you just
tell me about it?

11:51.838 --> 11:54.342
For many years,
we could not have children.

11:54.343 --> 11:56.931
But life is a powerful force.

11:58.392 --> 12:00.354
Slowly we started
having them again.

12:00.355 --> 12:02.441
They are our
most precious resource.

12:02.442 --> 12:04.111
So the cluster system was born.

12:04.112 --> 12:06.199
Six parents to every child.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.663
It started with seven,
but you can imagine

12:08.664 --> 12:10.165
the complications
that brought with it.

12:10.166 --> 12:11.627
Yeah.

12:11.628 --> 12:15.510
- Seven.
- We were so naive.

12:15.511 --> 12:17.806
- Torque?
- Anteater?

12:17.807 --> 12:19.601
- Rivet.
- It's me, Rivet.

12:19.602 --> 12:21.730
You're a farmer now.

12:21.731 --> 12:24.193
You always dreamed
about being a farmer.

12:24.194 --> 12:27.199
- I did?
- Yeah.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.122
I'm so very happy
to see you alive.

12:30.123 --> 12:33.420
Watching that Cy-noceros
gore you with its mecha-horn...

12:34.757 --> 12:38.138
You weren't the only one
gutted that day.

12:38.139 --> 12:40.893
Yeah, uh, okay.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.856
Sorry about your brain.

12:42.857 --> 12:47.031
Ah, that cat-fucker knew
how to handle a flamethrower.

12:47.032 --> 12:50.581
It's just too bad
Cy-nos can't be burned.

12:52.459 --> 12:54.420
What's a flamethrower?

12:54.421 --> 12:56.633
And a cat-fucker?

12:56.634 --> 12:59.180
- Emu?
- Toad?

12:59.181 --> 13:01.100
Tiger's not gonna believe this--

13:01.101 --> 13:02.645
Do you remember this,
Papa Torque?

13:02.646 --> 13:04.231
Let me stop you right there,
little lady.

13:04.232 --> 13:06.820
Papa Torque doesn't remember
jack shit.

13:06.821 --> 13:08.824
No, come look.

13:08.825 --> 13:10.912
- Come look.
- You'll remember.

13:10.913 --> 13:12.414
I promise.

13:14.044 --> 13:16.047
Oh.

13:16.048 --> 13:18.761
Oh, this me?

13:18.762 --> 13:19.971
Every day.

13:19.972 --> 13:23.311
Seven years of your life.

13:23.312 --> 13:24.438
Oh.

13:25.692 --> 13:28.446
You'll come back.
You'll come back.

13:28.447 --> 13:30.827
- Later.
- Okay.

13:35.169 --> 13:37.089
Torque!

13:37.090 --> 13:38.759
Um, I--I can explain...

13:38.760 --> 13:41.264
No thanks.

13:41.265 --> 13:44.270
Two-for-one deal!
That's a two-for-one deal!

13:44.271 --> 13:45.565
Give me a hand here.

14:01.973 --> 14:04.561
Best at the market,
right here!

14:04.562 --> 14:05.938
Right here, best of market!

14:07.568 --> 14:09.905
Buckets of piss!

14:11.868 --> 14:14.371
Torque!

14:14.372 --> 14:16.794
You're up.

14:19.341 --> 14:21.093
Weasel!

14:21.094 --> 14:23.974
Oh, come here!

14:23.975 --> 14:27.022
It's so good to
see your face again.

14:27.023 --> 14:28.901
Especially on your body.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.863
What--what's going on here?

14:30.864 --> 14:32.366
Oh, just saying hi
to an old friend.

14:32.367 --> 14:35.497
This is the most
we've ever spoken.

14:35.498 --> 14:39.213
Torque, you were Soul Voucher
at my Cluster Bundling.

14:39.214 --> 14:41.092
Oh.

14:41.093 --> 14:42.512
Oh, I'm sorry, dude.

14:42.513 --> 14:44.306
Yeah, I got
the sand brain, yeah.

14:44.307 --> 14:47.187
Just trying to piece together
what happened.

14:47.188 --> 14:48.398
Yeah.

14:48.399 --> 14:50.151
I remember being aided

14:50.152 --> 14:53.617
by a statuesque,
purple-haired warrior.

14:53.618 --> 14:55.412
- Huh.
- Oh, yeah.

14:55.413 --> 14:57.959
You mean the Chope that
kicked the shit out of Wrench?

15:01.091 --> 15:04.096
You never could fight,
you silly son of a bitch.

15:04.097 --> 15:06.560
- You don't know him.
- You're--you're my friend.

15:06.561 --> 15:08.312
Oh, well.

15:08.313 --> 15:10.400
So, what's a Chope?

15:10.401 --> 15:12.320
You really are out of it, man.

15:12.321 --> 15:13.907
Chosen People?

15:13.908 --> 15:15.619
Bio-Techs?

15:15.620 --> 15:17.540
The bastards who got the cure?

15:17.541 --> 15:20.336
- Oh, no.
- No, Tiger's no Chope.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.007
Turned tail and scattered
as soon as

15:22.008 --> 15:23.677
we got out of the 'shrooms
for the Bio-Tech test.

15:23.678 --> 15:25.096
That usually means one thing.

15:25.097 --> 15:26.808
Oh, I'm sorry, first, she

15:26.809 --> 15:28.687
kicked your ass
and stole your cloak.

15:30.984 --> 15:33.781
Oh, she does like a good cloak.

15:33.782 --> 15:36.494
All right, fellas, uh,
good talk, good talk.

15:36.495 --> 15:39.709
I'm just gonna pop outside,
as per doctor's orders,

15:39.710 --> 15:41.170
gotta stretch these wounds,
you know--

15:41.171 --> 15:44.009
Whoa.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.890
What, is there some law
against going outside?

15:46.891 --> 15:48.351
Matter of fact, there is.

15:48.352 --> 15:50.188
Thanks to you
and that lavender Chope,

15:50.189 --> 15:51.983
snuck past our patrols.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.695
Now the NAG's on lockdown.

15:53.696 --> 15:56.325
- Whoa.
- Come on, guys.

15:56.326 --> 15:58.789
You know.
It's Torque.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.709
You...

16:00.710 --> 16:03.256
Whoa.

16:03.257 --> 16:06.972
Oh, but, I was Seal Vendor
at your Cluster fiddling.

16:06.973 --> 16:09.351
- Do you hear yourself?
- You sound ridiculous.

16:11.398 --> 16:14.070
You shifty little slunt.

17:19.117 --> 17:20.995
Shake-shakey.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.707
Shake, shake, shake.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.626
Hey.
The fuck is this?

17:44.627 --> 17:46.838
- That's Colonel Worm.
- What's his deal?

17:46.839 --> 17:48.759
It's a story you used to
tell me about the worm

17:48.760 --> 17:51.096
who wasn't afraid of the crows,
even though they were different.

17:51.097 --> 17:52.767
He would sneak away from
all the other worms

17:52.768 --> 17:54.646
and have adventures.

17:54.647 --> 17:56.357
He fell in love
with Captain Crow.

17:56.358 --> 17:58.486
They were gonna team up
and battle the robot army.

17:58.487 --> 18:00.281
- Yeah-yeah-yeah.
- About the sneaking out.

18:00.282 --> 18:01.993
Is it through this tunnel here?

18:01.994 --> 18:03.914
- Yeah.
- It was a secret tunnel.

18:03.915 --> 18:06.168
He needed a magic feather
to find the entrance.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.423
- The fuck?
- Here.

18:09.635 --> 18:11.261
Oh.

18:11.262 --> 18:12.682
Looks like ole Colonel Worm

18:12.683 --> 18:15.269
racked up some
frequent flyer miles.

18:15.270 --> 18:17.315
You're not getting better,
are you?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.926
Pump rules!

18:30.927 --> 18:32.930
Hey, boss!
Oh.

18:32.931 --> 18:35.435
You're--you're here.
Um, I--uh, I straightened up.

18:35.436 --> 18:37.773
Your--your tools
are all where you like them.

18:37.774 --> 18:39.192
I know, I, uh, put the...

18:39.193 --> 18:40.571
Settle down.
Settle down.

18:40.572 --> 18:42.575
I've got amnesia.

18:42.576 --> 18:44.327
- What's your name?
- Pump.

18:44.328 --> 18:48.043
I'm--I'm Pump,
your humble apprentice.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.129
You don't remember me.

18:49.130 --> 18:50.966
- Nope.
- Do I like you?

18:50.967 --> 18:52.385
Well, we--

18:52.386 --> 18:54.933
- That's a no.
- Okay.

18:55.894 --> 18:57.938
So what was it like
with those Chopes, huh?

18:57.939 --> 18:59.817
You murder any when you escaped?

18:59.818 --> 19:03.909
Son, I've killed enough Chopes
to last my lifetime and yours.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.956
That's the best thing
I've ever heard.

19:06.957 --> 19:08.543
The fuck is this thing?

19:08.544 --> 19:10.296
Oh, that's an awl.

19:10.297 --> 19:12.510
It's one of
your wheel-making tools.

19:12.511 --> 19:16.017
Oh. Nice.

19:17.729 --> 19:19.565
So, uh,

19:19.566 --> 19:21.778
- Pump?
- Yeah.

19:21.779 --> 19:23.405
Where's the tunnel
out of this place?

19:23.406 --> 19:26.036
- Oh, no.
- No, no, not this again.

19:26.037 --> 19:28.959
Isn't this what got you
in trouble the last time?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.754
All this sneaking around?

19:30.755 --> 19:33.050
Please, don't--don't
make me cover for you again.

19:33.051 --> 19:35.221
You my apprentice?

19:35.222 --> 19:36.265
Yeah.

19:36.266 --> 19:37.685
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:38.980 --> 19:40.524
Tell me where the tunnel is.

19:40.525 --> 19:42.235
Okay, okay, okay.

19:42.236 --> 19:44.740
Okay, okay, it's, um,

19:44.741 --> 19:48.163
it's 50 chits
to the blind baker

19:48.164 --> 19:51.253
and you can escape
through the OBG.

19:51.254 --> 19:53.048
Old Below Ground?

19:53.049 --> 19:56.096
Okay. Great.

19:56.097 --> 19:57.976
Where are the chits?

20:00.022 --> 20:02.610
Oh, you got to be shitting me.
We don't got any chits?

20:02.611 --> 20:05.532
What have you been doing
while I was gone?

20:05.533 --> 20:07.327
I don't know how
to make wheels.

20:07.328 --> 20:09.497
Oh, damn.

20:09.498 --> 20:12.838
Oh.
I was a bad master.

20:12.839 --> 20:15.217
That's on me.

20:15.218 --> 20:16.804
Listen.

20:16.805 --> 20:18.600
If you're gonna learn
anything from me, boy,

20:18.601 --> 20:21.564
it's gonna be
personal responsibility.

20:21.565 --> 20:23.652
All right, 50 chits.

20:23.653 --> 20:25.446
No problem.

20:25.447 --> 20:28.035
Now let's make

21:30.160 --> 21:31.704
Looks like we're on a roll!

21:31.705 --> 21:34.042
- Wait, what?
- What did--what did you just say?

21:34.043 --> 21:35.545
You know that had, like,
another meaning, right?

21:35.546 --> 21:38.133
Yeah, that's why I said it.

21:38.134 --> 21:41.682
So, uh, what's a bad boy
like this go for?

21:41.683 --> 21:43.435
What do you mean?

21:43.436 --> 21:45.481
Well, how much do we charge
for a beaut like this?

21:45.482 --> 21:47.026
One chit.

21:47.027 --> 21:49.698
Everything in the NAG
is one chit.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.161
Son of a bitch.

21:52.162 --> 21:54.959
Once word gets out
that Torque's wheel shop

21:54.960 --> 21:59.008
is back in business,
we'll be rolling in chit.

21:59.009 --> 22:01.179
Well, this is me.

22:01.180 --> 22:02.431
Where you going?

22:02.432 --> 22:03.643
What's happening over there?

22:03.644 --> 22:05.772
Very funny.

22:05.773 --> 22:08.277
- I'm still un-clustered.
- So?

22:08.278 --> 22:11.324
- So it's Sowing Night.
- I'm on MD.

22:11.325 --> 22:13.328
Muffle duty.
Wow.

22:13.329 --> 22:15.082
You really do
got the sand brain.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.629
Anyway.
Have fun tonight.

22:17.630 --> 22:19.215
Yeah, you too.

22:19.216 --> 22:21.303
Hey, Pump.

22:21.304 --> 22:23.641
You did good today.

22:23.642 --> 22:26.188
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

22:26.189 --> 22:28.150
Don't let it go to your head.

22:28.151 --> 22:29.778
It's already in my head.

22:29.779 --> 22:31.824
Just--

22:31.825 --> 22:33.243
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:33.244 --> 22:35.207
We got 49 more wheels to make.

22:36.919 --> 22:38.129
All right.

22:39.841 --> 22:41.384
Okay, young ones,
circle up!

22:41.385 --> 22:43.723
Bring it down!

22:49.945 --> 22:52.114
Two... six...

22:52.115 --> 22:53.785
All right!

22:57.125 --> 23:01.299
Someone's so excited to sow
that he came home early.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.053
That's the spirit.

23:03.054 --> 23:04.848
Okay, let's
take it slow tonight

23:04.849 --> 23:07.228
since it's Torque's first time
back in the rotation.

23:07.229 --> 23:09.148
Oh, he'll do just fine.

23:09.149 --> 23:10.777
He's a natural.

23:10.778 --> 23:12.280
Okay, but just
to play it safe,

23:12.281 --> 23:13.866
let's keep him in the four-slot.

23:13.867 --> 23:16.413
Easy on the mouth play,
light frottage, no anal,

23:16.414 --> 23:18.000
until after the first
wheelbarrow,

23:18.001 --> 23:19.419
then it's all anal,
just pound it in there

23:19.420 --> 23:20.964
until we shoot the bucket.

23:20.965 --> 23:24.888
Let's try to keep
a come radius of about 3.2.

23:24.889 --> 23:26.642
This is our sex night?

23:26.643 --> 23:29.147
Harvest moon
and we're communo-ovulating.

23:29.148 --> 23:31.151
No better time to make a baby.

23:31.152 --> 23:34.115
Time to put your mightiest
tool to work, big fella.

23:34.116 --> 23:36.494
It's what we've all
been waiting for.

23:52.194 --> 23:54.616
- Tick-tock.
- Show us your penis.

24:06.932 --> 24:10.688
- Look at it!
- Look at it!

24:10.689 --> 24:12.609
- Oh!
- What did I say?

24:12.610 --> 24:13.945
I told you that wasn't Torque!

24:13.946 --> 24:15.615
And look, now we have proof!

24:15.616 --> 24:17.619
That's right.
I'm not Torque.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.290
I'm not the man
who left here two years ago.

24:20.291 --> 24:21.752
That man is dead!

24:21.753 --> 24:23.965
Probably.
I have no idea.

24:23.966 --> 24:26.428
Don't look away!
Stare at it!

24:26.429 --> 24:27.597
Face it!

24:27.598 --> 24:29.308
How is this possible?

24:30.311 --> 24:32.398
Yes.

24:32.399 --> 24:35.572
My journey has taken me
across space and time

24:35.573 --> 24:37.450
and dimensions
of human suffering

24:37.451 --> 24:39.705
none of you could ever imagine.

24:39.706 --> 24:42.961
I've fought monsters.

24:42.962 --> 24:44.798
And I've become one.

24:44.799 --> 24:49.056
But I did it to create
a better world for all of you.

24:49.057 --> 24:52.146
I just never expected
to live in it.

24:52.147 --> 24:55.737
Now I walk these streets
a stranger,

24:55.738 --> 24:59.494
knowing everyone and no one.

24:59.495 --> 25:02.918
This is no flood of lies.

25:02.919 --> 25:06.926
This is me, me,

25:06.927 --> 25:10.808
drowning in my own truth.

25:10.809 --> 25:12.771
I don't belong in this world

25:12.772 --> 25:16.946
anymore than this dick
belongs on my body,

25:16.947 --> 25:20.035
which is not at all.

25:23.251 --> 25:25.212
My name is Wolf.

25:25.213 --> 25:29.806
Resistance soldier
667-dash-259.

25:32.979 --> 25:36.944
How dare you

25:36.945 --> 25:41.077
not tell us that
from the beginning?

25:41.078 --> 25:45.503
I was so mean to you,
so distrustful,

25:45.504 --> 25:48.341
only because I was scared,

25:48.342 --> 25:50.638
and I love you,

25:50.639 --> 25:52.767
and I don't want
to lose you again.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.771
Two years of torture.

25:54.772 --> 25:57.401
Even the strongest of us
would go mad.

25:57.402 --> 26:01.535
- How could you be the same?
- We accept you,

26:01.536 --> 26:05.668
Wolf, Torque, whatever
you choose to call yourself.

26:05.669 --> 26:09.175
Sand-brained, battle-scarred,

26:09.176 --> 26:11.930
altered.

26:11.931 --> 26:14.936
We accept it all.

26:14.937 --> 26:16.523
Enough talk.

26:16.524 --> 26:18.611
Let's find this tiny dick
a hole.
