00:06.480 --> 00:07.993
Ah, finally.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.548
Sorry, swift half after work.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.039
Not that swift.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.838
Well, who drinks halves any more?

00:13.920 --> 00:15.911
Now you're here, what do you make of this?

00:19.960 --> 00:21.757
<i>Is it a thermometer?</i>

00:21.840 --> 00:23.034
The reading.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.475
It's a little high.
- It is high, isn't it?

00:25.560 --> 00:27.391
Well, a little. But don't worry,

00:27.480 --> 00:30.313
those things are imprecise,
the margin of error.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.119
He could be one notch lower.
- Or one notch higher.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.317
Go to the chemist.
Go on, go and see what he can give us.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.879
I've just got back.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.996
Well, it could be anything.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.992
It could be cold, it could be fever.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.789
That's what you get
when you take a child out without its coat.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.871
Oh.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.916
The chemist's.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.996
Hurry, please.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.680 --> 01:18.477
Pick it up, come on!

01:18.560 --> 01:20.676
<i>Giggs again. He's been briliant.</i>

01:20.760 --> 01:22.273
<i>Is this the first of the day?</i>

01:24.200 --> 01:25.918
Ryan, you...Satan!

01:27.240 --> 01:31.233
<i>This week's What The Papers Say
is presented by...</i>

01:43.080 --> 01:45.992
What are you playing at?
- Shh! The children are asleep.

01:46.080 --> 01:49.152
Is this because I'm seeing Mark?
- So you no longer deny

01:49.240 --> 01:52.152
you're seeing him?
- David, we are getting a divorce.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.593
I can do what I want.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.318
Being married never stopped you.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.472
David, don't use the children.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.118
I want to spend time with them.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.792
You should be happy.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.996
Mummy?
- It's all right, go back to bed.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.718
Darling.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.749
I want to go home.
- Yup.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.031
And I'm here to take you,
darling - and the girls.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.752
What took you so long?

02:21.840 --> 02:24.798
Trying to find a chemist that was open.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.758
I rang your mobile about three times.
You didn't answer.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.796
Well, I couldn't hear it in the pub.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.949
Pub?

02:32.040 --> 02:35.157
Swift half.
- Who drinks halves any more?

02:35.240 --> 02:37.470
It was Man United, pay per view.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.232
What did he give you?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.390
Calpol.
- Where is it?

02:45.720 --> 02:46.675
Mm.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.354
Time, ladies and gentlemen.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.557
What on earth is wrong with you?
- I can nip back.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.993
No, don't, he's fine.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.752
But how could you go to a pub?

02:55.840 --> 02:58.559
He's fine?
- His temperature's down.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.313
But you weren't to know that.
You thought he was ill.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.356
And still you went to the pub.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.477
Adam, that is not parenting.
That's... That's child abuse.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.391
Hang on, hang on.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.119
Nice of you to turn up,
because you're never here.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.031
That's not fair.
- Even when you are,

03:13.120 --> 03:15.236
you're off with the fairies.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.869
You pay no attention to Matthew.
- He's welded to your chest.

03:18.960 --> 03:23.397
If I try to pick him up, you snatch him away.
- Because you would drop him.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.392
He's not even ill. He's fine,
and I'm getting grief.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.199
I'm not having this discussion.
We're going to bed.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.555
I take it you'll be sleeping in the nursery.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.796
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.716
I want you to take the gloves off.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.677
No concessions.

03:42.760 --> 03:46.389
Don't see why I should support her
while she's carrying on with that man.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.358
And I don't want him in the house
with my children.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.396
That is easier said than done, Mr Marsden.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.313
The law's clear on these matters.
There's only so much leeway.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.356
Then use it.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.432
And I want the grounds for the divorce
to be her adultery.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.829
That's what killed the marriage.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.992
It would help if you could give me something
to build a case.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.672
Her adultery.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.273
No, no. Something more.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.636
Something...that could cast her
in an unsympathetic light, perhaps.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.473
What, like her being a recovering alcoholic?

04:14.560 --> 04:16.232
Yeah, that would help.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.439
Mr Marsden, judges love that sort of thing.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.353
No, wait... No!
- This is dynamite.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.874
Trust me.
- You're not using that. I won't let you.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.393
This could get you all you want.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.516
Yeah, but at what cost?

04:32.560 --> 04:34.437
I mean, Karen's behaved...

04:34.520 --> 04:36.476
I'm not going to stoop that low.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.670
You'll just have to make the best
case you can.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.036
This is all your fault, you know.
- What?

04:46.120 --> 04:49.396
Rachel and I, we were getting on fine
till you came along.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.870
Pardon me for breathing.
I didn't ask to be brought into this world.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.514
How is it?
- Normal.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.750
Not really cut out for parenting, are you?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.115
Most marriages that break up

05:01.200 --> 05:04.829
do so within a year-and-a-half
of a child being born, I read.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.831
You've still got 15 months to go.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.751
I am not walking out.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.308
Why don't you? Your job's finished here.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.834
We don't need you any more.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.911
I told you not to put him on the table.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.309
How is he?

05:18.400 --> 05:20.391
What? Oh, yeah. Er...

05:20.480 --> 05:22.232
he's fine.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.231
Good, good, good.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.477
Cos we don't want you poorly
for your naming ceremony, do we?

05:28.560 --> 05:31.393
No. Come on.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.791
Hello, remember me?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.713
No, I don't think so.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.233
Oh.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.312
Unless...you're the one
who thinks I look pregnant.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.515
So, the kid you look after's got a lesson?

05:52.600 --> 05:55.717
No, tomorrow. I'm a member now.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.156
Really? So I can look forward
to seeing a lot more of you, then?

05:59.240 --> 06:00.958
You've seen enough already.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.996
Very nice it is, too.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.393
Hi, Lee.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.754
All right?

06:11.760 --> 06:13.478
Listen, you.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.836
I'm not so keen on swimming, you know.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.754
So, to save me coming,
doing lots of lengths,

06:20.840 --> 06:22.512
why don't you tell me, huh?

06:22.600 --> 06:24.318
Are you just a Flirty Gertie type?

06:26.160 --> 06:28.355
Like to make eyes at all the ladies?

06:28.440 --> 06:30.317
Or...

06:30.400 --> 06:34.359
would you like to go out for a drink
with me some time?

06:34.440 --> 06:37.716
I suppose I am a bit of a Flirty Gertie.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.156
But I would love to go out
for a drink with you some time.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.076
Have you got him?

06:48.160 --> 06:49.832
OK, thanks.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.558
Audrey, can I get you anything?
Drink? Cigarette?

06:58.640 --> 07:01.279
Oh, I don't smoke.
- That's not what I heard.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.271
Peter, what have you been saying?

07:03.360 --> 07:05.032
Oh, no, Audrey. Don't worry.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.475
Your secret's safe with me,
you little devil.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.040
Off you go. Are we running late?

07:15.120 --> 07:16.758
Oh, fashionably.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.796
No, Mark's parking the car.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.235
Mark?
- You know we're seeing each other.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.151
Yes, but, Karen, David's here.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.231
Oh. Has he brought anyone?

07:30.120 --> 07:31.792
Hi, Rachel.
- Mark, hello.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.871
Come on in.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.916
<i>Joshy, how does it work?</i>

07:38.000 --> 07:41.197
Oh, girls.
Don't you look so pretty in your dresses?

07:42.280 --> 07:45.352
Hi.
- Hi.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.392
Right, erm...like a drink?

07:57.480 --> 07:59.072
Er...juice?

08:00.160 --> 08:02.879
Great, yeah.
- Thanks.

08:07.960 --> 08:11.953
When Adam and Rachel asked me
to be godfather to Matthew,

08:12.040 --> 08:17.910
erm...they asked me if I'd say
a few words at the naming ceremony.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.831
Erm...

08:19.920 --> 08:22.718
something that in the years to come

08:22.800 --> 08:24.711
the little fellow might remember.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.395
Now, I was going to read
the Manchester United team sheet

08:28.480 --> 08:30.471
the day that he was born.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.791
I'm glad I didn't.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.758
I couldn't decide what to do,
but then it came to me.

08:42.840 --> 08:48.278
What, if anything - say, if my house
was on fire, would I want to save?

08:48.360 --> 08:52.751
Now, Adam read some words
at my son's christening,

08:53.480 --> 08:56.278
written by my dear dad,

08:56.360 --> 08:58.396
about being a father.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.790
Inevitably, parents love their children

09:02.880 --> 09:05.713
more than their children love them.

09:05.800 --> 09:10.715
A father looks at his son...
and sees part of himself.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.595
They say be careful what you wish for.

09:14.680 --> 09:19.549
My wish for my son
was that he grew up independent of mind

09:19.640 --> 09:21.631
and strong of will.

09:21.720 --> 09:25.269
I know that Pete will be a good father.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.914
I've seen the way he looks at his son...

09:30.600 --> 09:32.113
..with love,

09:33.200 --> 09:35.475
a love that only a father can recognise,

09:35.560 --> 09:37.551
and which I recognise

09:37.640 --> 09:40.598
because it's how I look at Pete.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.636
Until you have a child,

09:42.720 --> 09:45.917
you won't know how true these words are.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.513
And Adam knows.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.110
No, I don't.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.556
I'm sorry, I've tried.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.596
I really have.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.036
I just don't feel it.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.036
Pete.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.639
Maybe the United team
would have gone down better.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.551
Well, I liked it.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.632
Erm...Karen,
I'm taking the children home with me.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.473
What? No, you're not.
You'll see them on Wednesday.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.437
I'll have them then, as well.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.353
I think I'll pop outside and have a fag.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.396
Yes, why don't you?

10:52.160 --> 10:53.832
Not the time or the place.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.956
What? For rubbing my nose in it?

10:56.040 --> 10:58.600
And another thing,
I don't want hlm in the house

10:58.680 --> 11:01.513
when the children are there.
- You can't dictate that.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.238
It's upsetting Josh.
- No.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.993
What's upsetting Josh
is you using him as a pawn.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.718
He told me
he didn't want to go to your flat any more.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.711
Oh, don't talk rubbish.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.631
I'm going to withdraw my petition.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.312
I'll allow you to divorce me.

11:18.400 --> 11:22.996
But it's not in the children's best interests
to be split between two homes.

11:24.080 --> 11:27.390
I will instruct my lawyer to seek
a residence order on my behalf.

11:27.480 --> 11:31.678
You will, of course, have visiting rights...
unless you abuse them.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.551
I feel Iike I'm being pushed out.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.112
I feel like you don't need me any more.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.794
I feel like I'm whingeing.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.836
No, Adam. This is important.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.070
At first it was just the two of us.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.675
Then I thought it would be the three of us,
a family.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.878
That's what I've always wanted.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.599
Instead it feels like I'm superfluous.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.672
You've got Matthew, and you don't need me.

12:32.760 --> 12:36.036
Adam, that's not true.
- You don't touch me any more.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.190
And you don't want me to touch him.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.714
Sorry, it's just...

12:43.480 --> 12:45.550
Oh, Adam. I did something terrible.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.198
What?

12:47.280 --> 12:49.157
I took my eye off him.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.556
I went into the kltchen.
I put him on the kitchen table.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.870
Hang on. You don't let me
put him on the table.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.916
I know, but I did and...

12:59.720 --> 13:02.553
the phone rang
and it was you from the office, bored.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.959
Well...

13:05.440 --> 13:07.749
I turned around and...

13:07.840 --> 13:09.432
Too late.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.476
No.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.309
Adam, it's not funny.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.039
No, I'm sure it wasn't, but...

13:27.120 --> 13:28.917
I can just see your face.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.590
<i>It's just that...</i>

13:36.680 --> 13:37.715
Are you all right?

13:37.800 --> 13:39.233
<i>..it was so hard to have him.</i>

13:39.320 --> 13:40.275
Thank God.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.635
And then the birth.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.668
I'm just worried the whole time
that at any moment something might...

13:49.760 --> 13:51.432
take him away from me.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.636
Nothing's going to happen.

13:53.720 --> 13:57.110
Christ, you dropped him on his face
and that didn't hurt.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.878
He's tough.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.996
He's had to be to get this far.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.274
I just wish I felt something for him.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.636
Right, time I packed.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.472
Audrey, you don't have to go.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.633
I want to...now that they've said
they'll have me back.

14:28.720 --> 14:32.872
Besides, you two need to start
your married life.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.959
Look...

14:41.000 --> 14:42.877
..maybe we should start again, hey?

14:42.960 --> 14:45.269
We haven't done too well so far.

14:45.360 --> 14:50.115
No, and er...I think I'm more to
blame than you.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.231
Er...actually,
you're supposed to disagree with me there.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.475
I need to feel like I'm your wife, Pete.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.437
Not competing with Jenny,

15:01.520 --> 15:04.671
not a lodger with voting rights,
but an equal partner.

15:04.760 --> 15:08.150
You are. And there's no reason
why you should think otherwise,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.151
OK?

15:19.920 --> 15:20.989
Right.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.038
Maybe I should sleep on the left-hand side
tonight.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.233
Present for you.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.276
From Matthew.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.714
I think it's going to take
more than presents.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.558
It's a breast pump.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.358
How is this for me, exactly?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.353
How's it going?

16:12.440 --> 16:13.873
It's nice.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.717
Breastfeeding's nice.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.392
Wait till he gets teeth.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.157
Hello.
- Peter,

16:42.240 --> 16:45.232
I was wondering if you could get me
some more of that stuff.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.072
Have you smoked it all already?

16:48.160 --> 16:49.639
Well,

16:49.720 --> 16:53.759
me and a few friends.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.799
<i>Dry with bright and sunny spells.
Top temperature 18C - that's 64F.</i>

17:03.880 --> 17:08.829
<i>It's 8..15 and I've received
a letter. Yes. A letter. Not an e-mail or a fax.</i>

17:08.920 --> 17:12.799
Do we have to listen to this?
- What's wrong with Radio 2?

17:12.880 --> 17:15.314
I'd tell you, but I've got to be
at work in an hour.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.351
Come on, girls, eat your breakfast.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.034
Can you get that, Ramona?

17:28.960 --> 17:30.871
Why? It will no be for me.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.472
Hey, it's for me!

17:43.000 --> 17:45.514
<i>My client Mr Marsden
will strenuously resist</i>

17:45.600 --> 17:48.160
<i>any attempts to limit
access to his children.</i>

17:48.240 --> 17:51.198
<i>A financial settlement still
has to be agreed.</i>

17:51.280 --> 17:57.799
<i>To facilitate this, I will require evidence
of Mrs Marsden's outgoings and expenditures.</i>

18:01.320 --> 18:04.357
<i>Dear Mr Marsden,
you have been personally selected</i>

18:04.440 --> 18:08.319
<i>to receive this limited offer
of the Excelsior Platinum Card.</i>

18:14.360 --> 18:17.511
Can I take the car today?
- No, you're a fitness instructor.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.512
Can't you walk?
- You're a fat bastard. Can't you?

18:28.480 --> 18:31.631
<i>Jazz up your mobile
with one of our funky ring tones.</i>

18:36.120 --> 18:38.759
Will you remember
to take that video back today?

18:38.840 --> 18:40.990
Yeah.
- Cos you forgot yesterday.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.275
I had a lot on.
- Hmm. Yeah, right.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.316
Yours.
- Thank you.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.152
Bye.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.872
Bye.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.518
<i>Bye!</i>

18:57.440 --> 18:59.954
<i>Looking for love
or just wanting company?</i>

19:00.040 --> 19:02.713
<i>Our relaxed dinner parties
are the perfect setting</i>

19:02.800 --> 19:06.395
<i>for making new friends
and maybe meeting that special mate.</i>

19:08.080 --> 19:11.993
<i>..for making new friends
and maybe meeting that special mate.</i>

19:12.080 --> 19:15.550
To expedite your application
for settlement on the basis of marriage,

19:15.640 --> 19:18.712
we require you and your husband
to attend an interview,

19:18.800 --> 19:22.156
bringing with you documentary evidence
of residence and cohabitation.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.992
What does all that mean?

19:24.080 --> 19:27.152
I think it means
they suspect our marriage is a sham.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.794
Ramona, thanks for our drink.
Here's a small gift.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.031
I saw it and just thought
how perfect lt would look on you.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.111
<i>Hope to see you soon, Lee.</i>

19:54.680 --> 19:57.274
Hello, Hallam Advertising.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.635
Yes. Just one moment, I'll put you through.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.154
I don't see what the problem is.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.639
Could you hold on a sec?

20:04.720 --> 20:06.358
Hi.
- Hi.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.158
Won't be a minute.
- Oh, OK.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.196
Hi. Look...

20:11.440 --> 20:13.317
I thought we'd agreed on a format.

20:17.280 --> 20:21.353
Howard, I put a lot of time and effort into this.
- Is that Howard Trigg?

20:21.440 --> 20:24.159
Where do you want to go from here?
- Can I say hello?

20:25.400 --> 20:27.994
OK. Sure. First thing.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.836
God! Clients.
- What's the matter with him?

20:32.920 --> 20:36.549
Hello. Oh, nothing.
He won't sign off on the ad.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.791
I don't know why. This is excellent.
What does the research say?

20:40.920 --> 20:43.388
So...how are you keeping?
You're looking well.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.313
Does it work for the target audience?
- Yes.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.994
Yes, it does. Yes. Right, I'll call him.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.469
Rachel... Who's managing this account?

20:52.560 --> 20:57.315
Sorry. You are. Until I get back.
But Howard Trigg needs to be told.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.356
You're on maternity leave.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.476
You lucky cow.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.869
Yeah, I am lucky. I am lucky, aren't I?

21:04.960 --> 21:07.633
He's lovely. He's gorgeous.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.038
Bastards!

21:11.120 --> 21:12.678
Yeah.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.716
Who?
- Management.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.314
What have they done?
- You haven't heard?

21:17.400 --> 21:19.755
No.
- Then you're one of the lucky ones.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.796
They've only gone and fired me.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.791
No.
- Well...

21:23.880 --> 21:26.075
Technically no, made me redundant.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.037
But it's the same difference.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.076
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.674
That came in the post this morning.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.513
A few of the lads have got them.
So you didn't, eh?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.556
No.

21:49.120 --> 21:53.432
And I'm waiting to hear from your wife's solicitor
regarding her annual expenditure.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.476
Still totting it up, are they?

21:55.560 --> 21:58.791
She's probably burnt out five
calculators already.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.875
I'm getting a valuation on all our assets.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.313
My assets.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.278
What progress with the children?

22:10.360 --> 22:12.112
None at the moment.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.715
Your wife insists that after the divorce
they live solely with her.

22:15.800 --> 22:19.429
Until then, they can still spend
one night a week at your apartment.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.351
Why can't they after our divorce?

22:21.440 --> 22:24.193
Your wife maintains that long term
it would be disruptive.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.157
What?
- A judge may sympathise.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.392
You will have visiting rights.
- No, no, no. That's not good enough.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.675
Proper access. OK?

22:32.760 --> 22:34.637
I want to be a father to my children,

22:34.720 --> 22:37.109
not just take them to
McDonald's once a month.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.679
I will do all I can.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.830
Whatever it takes, Robyn, I mean it.

22:40.920 --> 22:44.310
Really? So I can use
your wife's history of drinking?

22:48.440 --> 22:50.556
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.079
Is that everything?

22:56.280 --> 22:58.032
Yes, I think it is.

22:58.120 --> 23:02.318
You spend 30 quid a month on hair?
- Oh, here we go.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.834
It doesn't seem very much, that's all.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.876
Well, 45 pounds on a cut.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.076
But I don't have it done that often.

23:09.160 --> 23:11.230
Yeah, but there's got to be extras

23:11.320 --> 23:14.710
like tinting and highlights,
and crimping and stuff.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.153
Yep.

23:16.240 --> 23:20.472
You have to put these things down.
- Well, it doesn't amount to much.

23:20.560 --> 23:24.075
I don't think you're understanding
the concept of this.

23:24.160 --> 23:28.278
You see, you, say...demand a Porsche.

23:28.360 --> 23:31.477
They think that's unreasonable,
they knock you back,

23:31.560 --> 23:33.073
you settle for a BMW.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.230
If you start off by asking for a Renault,

23:35.320 --> 23:37.959
you'll probably wind up with a Robin Reliant.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.235
I drive an Audi.
- Mummy, I'm hungry.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.595
All right, Josh, darling. I'm coming.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.513
You know what?
I'm not going to start playing games.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.512
I'm going to ask for what I need.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.319
David's not unreasonable.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.039
Here. Will you give the kids their tea?

23:55.120 --> 23:58.874
Can't I answer the door instead?
- You only have to serve it up.

23:58.960 --> 23:59.915
Please?

24:00.920 --> 24:02.353
I want my tea. Now!

24:05.480 --> 24:06.754
Mrs Marsden?
- Yeah.

24:06.840 --> 24:09.957
Dennis Fowler. Arbuthnot and Pease.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.429
I'm here to value your house.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.795
I'm sorry?
- Your house.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.155
A valuation was requested by um...

24:18.200 --> 24:20.031
..Mr David Marsden.

24:21.080 --> 24:25.949
So...what does the evening hold
for a busy lawyer about town?

24:26.040 --> 24:28.031
Nothing glamorous, I'm afraid.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.510
Probably a hot bath and a glass of wine,
I should think.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.556
How about you?
- Oh.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.471
Something similar.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.913
Join me?

24:37.000 --> 24:41.073
I meant for a glass of wine.
Unless that's considered unprofessional.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.470
A hot bath might be,
but I think a glass of wine's safe enough.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.993
Yeah, great.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.594
Give me two minutes.
- I'll be here.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.876
Look, madam, it's not my fault
your husband didn't tell you.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.633
Well, you're not coming in.
- I don't want to come back.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.359
Good! Because I don't want you coming back!

25:02.200 --> 25:05.749
Right. He wants to play games.
How much did I say for a haircut?

25:05.840 --> 25:07.751
50 quid.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.319
Make it 60.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.877
I'll have to take the morning off.

25:13.960 --> 25:18.033
Hardly, our interview's at 9:00 am.
- But work don't need to know that.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.759
What's the kind of thing
they're looking for?

25:20.840 --> 25:24.753
Evidence that our relationship's
for real, I guess.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.990
Marriage certificate. That's easy.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.117
Unless it's been stamped,
''This was not a sham,''

25:30.200 --> 25:32.031
then I don't think that will be enough.

25:32.720 --> 25:36.269
Something that shows we're living together
as husband and wife.

25:36.360 --> 25:39.272
Like a gas bill.
- It's in my name.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.509
Uh...

25:40.600 --> 25:41.749
A mortgage?

25:42.840 --> 25:44.592
I'd better get that changed.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.632
Look. It's the wage slave.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.676
Yeah, it is.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.115
Hi.
- Hello. You're late.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.156
Yeah. Sorry.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.196
Leaving drink after work.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.236
Oh, right. Whose?

26:13.680 --> 26:15.193
Right. Look.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.829
What do you think will convince them
that our wedding was for real?

26:18.920 --> 26:20.876
Having been there.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.916
Sit yourself down.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.516
60 guests on the shores of Sydney Harbour.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.239
A string quartet, a motorboat.
- Our wedding video.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.436
I'm way ahead of you, kid.
- Genius.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.919
Ha-ha.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.397
I think you put the wrong tape in.
- Oh, what?

26:42.480 --> 26:44.436
That's last night's football.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.711
We don't have a spare copy, do we?

26:53.800 --> 26:55.358
Jesus, Pete!

26:55.440 --> 26:58.955
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
Everything'll be all right.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.951
No, I'm upset about the video.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.996
Oh, that? Yeah, sorry.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.232
Laid off?
- Well, they prefer ''retrenched''.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.276
But, yeah.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.112
Did you get a handshake?

27:13.200 --> 27:14.758
Yes.
- How much?

27:14.840 --> 27:16.751
No. I got a handshake.

27:17.840 --> 27:22.197
I mean, they're going to pay out my notice
and I don't have to go in again, but that's it.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.840
Well, that's not so bad. A month's grace.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.036
Fortnight.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.633
Oh.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.309
I've never been laid off before.

27:35.840 --> 27:40.072
I'm sorry, sweetheart. It must be horrible.
- It's never happened to you?

27:40.160 --> 27:41.388
God, no.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.073
No, I mean it could.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.355
It could happen to anyone.
- Losers.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.396
Anyone.

27:49.480 --> 27:53.553
Come on. Losers are the ones
that don't get other jobs.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.759
I made a few calls round this afternoon
while I could still dial out.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.718
<i>Sorry, Adam, we're not taklng
anyone on at the moment.</i>

28:07.320 --> 28:10.437
<i>Nothing here, I'm afraid. Sorry.</i>

28:12.200 --> 28:16.512
<i>Adam, I was about to ring you to find out
if there's any jobs going at your place.</i>

28:17.640 --> 28:20.313
Shit.
- Look, it's not my fault.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.070
What's that supposed to mean?

28:24.160 --> 28:27.118
Well, why did they pick you
and not someone else?

28:27.200 --> 28:30.909
They laid off half the department.
- So half stayed?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.878
I was senior, paid more than most.
- You're not now.

28:33.960 --> 28:34.995
Ha-ha!

28:36.120 --> 28:38.509
Sorry, I'm just a bit upset.

28:38.600 --> 28:42.036
My maternity pay's only half my salary.
- I know.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.829
And soon you'll get nothing.
- We've already established that!

28:45.920 --> 28:47.956
Well, we are going to struggle, Adam.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.393
Rachel.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.038
We're going to starve.

28:54.320 --> 28:58.313
Three things that really irritate you.
- Three things that irritate me?

28:59.360 --> 29:01.316
Um...

29:02.400 --> 29:04.231
I don't know. How about you?

29:04.320 --> 29:06.276
People who dodge the question.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.316
OK.

29:10.200 --> 29:14.557
Um... Er... Taxi drivers who stop
at the lights and read the paper.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.278
That's one.

29:16.360 --> 29:19.591
And...three putting
when you get to the green in two.

29:19.680 --> 29:22.558
Very annoying.
- Yes. Very annoying.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.915
And...er...Coronation Street.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.956
Your turn.
- Well...

29:27.040 --> 29:28.792
Coronation Street.

29:28.880 --> 29:31.440
People who treat life like it's a rehearsal.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.238
That's a bit heavy.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.276
The Times crossword.
- I try doing that.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.918
It drives me crazy.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.197
I got stuck on a clue today.
Perhaps you can help me.

29:40.280 --> 29:45.115
It was, ''Jack leaves meeting
oozing smarm''.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.156
Unction.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.192
Unction. Of course.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.633
Yes.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.472
You're too bright.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.074
Well, my colleague Nigel is.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.116
Cheek.

30:01.320 --> 30:03.038
So...

30:04.120 --> 30:05.758
What?

30:06.840 --> 30:11.311
It's just that we've drunk a bottle of wine together
and we haven't once mentioned work.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.437
Surprised that I have a life
outside of your divorce?

30:14.520 --> 30:16.590
Are you surprised I do?

30:19.520 --> 30:21.556
Why don't we get something to eat?

30:21.640 --> 30:23.596
Mm. Good idea.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.512
Thank you. That was lovely.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.074
So...why don't you come back to mine, then?

30:33.160 --> 30:34.832
It's getting late.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.309
That's all right. You can sleep over.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.836
I don't think so.
- Give me one good reason why not.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.911
I can give you three.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.956
Ramona's there, they'll be asleep.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.715
And in the morning?
- Well, she'll still be there.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.472
Yeah, but I'm their mother.

30:51.840 --> 30:52.989
Yeah.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.036
Right.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.317
So why don't we go back to yours, then?

30:58.400 --> 31:02.871
One day I would love you to,
but I still think it's too soon.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.593
Why?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.756
God, I can tell you don't have children.

31:08.840 --> 31:10.796
At the moment you're ''Mummy's friend''.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.269
If you stay over, have breakfast,

31:13.360 --> 31:15.510
they'll start thinking of you
as their new dad.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.160
Ah...
- Mm.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.559
Yeah.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.708
I could be gone before breakfast, then.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.916
Let's not run before we can walk.

31:30.120 --> 31:34.193
No. Quite right. Course not.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.840
What a good place.
- Yeah.

31:36.920 --> 31:39.957
Yeah. Quite a... Quite a young crowd.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.878
David...

31:44.960 --> 31:46.712
Forget it. Nothing.
- No, what?

31:46.800 --> 31:50.315
Would you...like to come back for coffee?

31:50.400 --> 31:53.836
That's very kind, but unless you have
decaf, I'll be up all night.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.797
I don't have coffee.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.075
Oh...

32:00.960 --> 32:02.916
Gosh.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.874
Yeah.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.074
So glad you take your work home with you.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.950
That seems like everything.
- We'll have the rent next month.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.473
Yeah, pal.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.835
Are you another bailiff?
- Social Services.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.717
I've come for the child.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.035
Adam.
- Huh?

32:39.120 --> 32:42.157
I think I should go back to work.
- What?

32:42.240 --> 32:47.678
It's pointless us both being at home,
especially when I've got a job waiting.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.911
You're on maternity leave.
- I'm sure they'll take me back.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.992
So we'll leave Matthew with a childminder?

32:54.080 --> 32:57.914
No? What would be the point of that?
You'd look after him.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.878
Me? I'm supposed to be looking for work.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.633
It's humiliating enough being unemployed

33:03.720 --> 33:05.711
without becoming a househusband.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.679
You're not going to be a househusband.
I wouldn't want you to be.

33:09.760 --> 33:12.069
Not very sexy, is it?
- No.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.594
You'd be having a career break,

33:14.680 --> 33:17.956
staying at home temporarily
until you sort your options out.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.031
Hmm.

33:22.120 --> 33:24.111
That doesn't sound too bad.
- No.

33:26.360 --> 33:27.793
Won't you miss him?

33:31.400 --> 33:34.198
I'll go in late and come home early.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.598
Thank God you work in advertising.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.628
Mindless.

35:04.880 --> 35:07.394
Pete, I'm nervous.
- There's no need to be.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.436
Our marriage is for real.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.556
This is just a formality, that's all.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.949
What's my favourite song?

35:14.040 --> 35:18.238
It's an immigration interview,
not a pub quiz. Relax, will you?

35:19.680 --> 35:20.749
Mrs Joanne Gifford.

35:23.800 --> 35:27.793
Oh, God. Sorry, that's me.
I don't use my married name.

35:27.880 --> 35:29.233
Mr Peter Gifford.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.597
<i>Can I just say something up front?</i>

35:34.680 --> 35:37.797
We don't have any documentary
evidence of cohabitation,

35:37.880 --> 35:40.075
no official letters with my name on.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.230
Except for the one that you sent us,

35:42.320 --> 35:44.880
which probably doesn't count, does it?

35:44.960 --> 35:47.269
<i>We were going to bring in our wedding video.</i>

35:47.360 --> 35:51.239
But he recorded over it.
- Football.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.356
After you.

36:03.640 --> 36:06.791
Right. Come on. Come on. Up and at 'em.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.799
Oh. Whoa. What time is it?

36:11.880 --> 36:13.757
9:30.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.479
I'm unemployed.
My day doesn't start until 11:00.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.950
Mine does. I've been onto my boss.
They're keen to have me back.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.998
They want to know when I can start.
- What did you say?

36:23.080 --> 36:24.911
I said it depends on the traffic.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.439
Have you seen the car keys?

36:27.520 --> 36:30.717
You're going in today?
I thought I was going to have a lie-in.

36:32.240 --> 36:35.357
You have.
Are you going to see me off, then?

36:37.800 --> 36:42.157
Peter Algernon Gifford.
Algernon was his father's name.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.999
Stella. Stella.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.469
Not married any more. Divorced.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.996
Lives in Miami. Don't know the address.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.878
April 12th, 1967.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.189
Crap at birthdays. Erm...

37:02.280 --> 37:05.078
But I do know that Jo's is June 18th.

37:05.160 --> 37:08.232
He's got singing today.
The directions are on the fridge.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.993
I've made you up some bottles.
I didn't do any lunch.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.719
Get some jars. His favourite's chicken.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.631
And we need some new nappies.

37:15.720 --> 37:18.632
I'll ring you from work
cos we need a lot of things.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.233
You'll enjoy spending some time together.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.038
We're looking forward to it.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.715
Bye, little one.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.599
Rach.
- Yeah?

37:33.560 --> 37:34.788
Thank you.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.279
Go.

37:39.280 --> 37:42.272
So. Your mother says you're a singer.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.588
Her favourite song.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.594
Bohemian Rhapsody. Crap.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.636
Er...

37:50.720 --> 37:53.518
She likes a lot of songs.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.876
Film? Er...Escape To Victory.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.198
Bravo Two Zero.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.748
His taste sucks, doesn't it?

38:06.800 --> 38:09.314
Let's move on.
- No, hang on, I want to get this one.

38:09.400 --> 38:12.551
I've lots of other questions.
- Something, by the Beatles.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.870
Anything in particular?
- No, Something.

38:14.960 --> 38:19.556
Can you be more specific?
- That's the title of the bloody song. Something.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.198
I'm sorry.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.952
This must be it, son.

38:40.720 --> 38:41.789
Hello.

38:41.880 --> 38:42.949
Hi, it's only me.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.838
I was just wondering.
Is everything all right?

38:45.920 --> 38:49.390
Since you called five minutes ago?
- It was more like ten.

38:49.480 --> 38:52.711
Everything's fine. We're just off
to the bookies. Joking.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.074
Get back to your job

38:54.160 --> 38:56.958
like a good working mother.
- Yes. OK, OK. Bye.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.839
Hello, Rachel Bradley.
- And stop staring at his photo.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.876
I am not staring. Bye.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.556
Tell me about how you two met.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.710
That one's easy. She was my lodger.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.918
I'd lost my job. And my flat.
And Pete had a spare room.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.232
Nothing happened at first.
- We just...clicked.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.914
I fancied her. But you would, wouldn't you?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.752
I wasn't sure if she fancied me.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.435
He wasn't as good-looking
as a lot of my other boyfriends,

39:35.520 --> 39:38.239
but um...he made me laugh.

39:38.320 --> 39:42.313
Her visa ran out.
- I went home. That was that.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.675
Then a mutual friend told me
she really liked me.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.512
So I hopped a plane to Oz.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.114
And he turned up on my doorstep.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.720
We fell in love.
- She proposed to me.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.951
And here we are.
- So you proposed to him?

39:56.040 --> 39:58.600
This occurred shortly after
her visa had run out?

39:59.880 --> 40:02.758
Well, yeah, but that's got
nothing to do with it.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.959
Mr Marsden, thanks for coming in.
Would you like coffee?

40:11.040 --> 40:14.316
No, I'm fine, thank you.
- Thanks, Martin. That'll be all.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.549
Your wife's estimate
of her annual outgoings and expenditure.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.870
Her solicitor faxed it over this morning.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.110
Yes. Erm...

40:27.200 --> 40:29.475
Look, about last night...

40:33.560 --> 40:35.471
700 pounds to get her hair done?

40:35.560 --> 40:38.597
Yes. That's not so outrageous,
but some of it is.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.398
Bikini waxing?

40:40.480 --> 40:42.391
Why should I... Flowers?

40:43.440 --> 40:46.637
What the hell is ''Pilates''?
She's taking the piss.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.589
I'll soon put a stop to that.
She sent the house valuers packing.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.752
You were going to say something...
about last night.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.557
Yes. Well...

40:58.640 --> 41:02.997
Obviously bad idea. Unprofessional.
Shouldn't happen again.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.639
Wouldn't you agree?

41:06.720 --> 41:10.429
Of course. In fact, if you'd
like me to resign...

41:10.520 --> 41:12.829
No, no. Far from it.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.950
Far from it.

41:28.880 --> 41:31.155
Martin. No, I'm on my way to court.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.789
Emergency injunction application.
I'll be in tomorrow.

41:34.880 --> 41:38.475
Hi, Sally. I'm going to be out of the office
all afternoon.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.393
Yeah. Client reappraisal.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.551
Hiya.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.437
I'm Adam.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.795
Helen. I'm a nanny.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.518
I thought maybe she was yours.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.319
This is Caroline. She's a nanny too.
- Hi.

42:27.360 --> 42:29.157
Oh, I see.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.595
Am I sitting on the nanny side of the room?

42:31.680 --> 42:33.318
Yeah, but that's OK.

42:33.400 --> 42:36.756
Shall we get started, then?
- What?

42:37.920 --> 42:40.275
That seemed to go all right.
- Piece of piss.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.954
I nearly forgot your favourite song.
- Something?

42:43.040 --> 42:45.759
That's what I said.
- Lady Madonna, Pete.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.360
Oh. Still.

42:51.840 --> 42:55.719
# Down by the river
where the green grass grows

42:55.800 --> 42:58.712
# There sits David, washing his clothes

42:58.800 --> 43:02.679
# He sings, he sings, a song so sweet

43:02.760 --> 43:06.639
# Calling to his playmates
up and down the street

43:06.720 --> 43:10.315
# Matthew, Matthew, won't you come to tea?

43:10.400 --> 43:13.915
# Come next Saturday at half past three

43:14.000 --> 43:17.310
# Teacakes and pancakes
and everything, we'll see

43:17.400 --> 43:21.393
# Oh, won't you have a lovely time
at half past three?

43:22.480 --> 43:25.119
And moving on.

43:25.200 --> 43:29.159
# Down by the river
where the green grass grows

43:29.240 --> 43:30.719
# There sits...

43:31.760 --> 43:33.352
Er...Adam.

43:33.440 --> 43:37.558
Erm...no. What you do here
is you sing the baby's name.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.438
Oh, right. Sorry.
# Matthew

43:40.520 --> 43:42.476
# Washing his clothes

43:42.560 --> 43:46.439
# He sings, he sings, a song so sweet

43:46.520 --> 43:50.433
# Calling to his playmates
up and down the street

43:50.520 --> 43:52.590
# Matthew, Matthew

43:53.640 --> 43:56.712
No. What you do there
is sing the name of the next child.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.074
Caitlin.

43:59.280 --> 44:02.317
Caitlin. Oh, right. Sorry. OK.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.709
OK. Let's go back to the beginning.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.870
# Two, three, four

44:06.960 --> 44:10.794
# Down by the river
where the green grass grows

44:10.880 --> 44:13.553
# There sits...
Adam. Matthew. Caitlin. Shite.

44:13.640 --> 44:15.039
Or maybe move on.

44:16.080 --> 44:19.755
# Down by the river
where the green grass grows...

44:19.840 --> 44:22.798
Sorry about that. What a nightmare.

44:22.880 --> 44:25.678
Never again. I promise. Never again.

44:26.920 --> 44:29.673
Your first time, isn't it?
- You could tell?

44:29.760 --> 44:31.990
Oh, yeah. I'm Sean.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.072
Adam.
- Yeah, I remember from...

44:35.160 --> 44:38.755
Ah. Oh, well, it's nice to meet
one of my own.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.991
So er...what do you make of all this?

44:42.080 --> 44:44.594
It's a load of old bollocks, isn't it?

44:44.680 --> 44:47.752
How do you mean?
- Our kids can't even sit up,

44:47.840 --> 44:49.273
never mind sing along.

44:49.360 --> 44:50.713
I don't agree with that.

44:50.800 --> 44:55.271
Babies are very suggestible.
Helps them develop a sense of rhythm.

44:55.360 --> 44:59.911
Besides, it's fun, isn't it?
Tallulah loves it.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.956
See you.
- See you.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.918
Tallulah. Great name.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.558
Wanker.

45:08.305 --> 45:14.465
