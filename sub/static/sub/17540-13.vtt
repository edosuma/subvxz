00:12.946 --> 00:15.180
(electricity crackling)

00:17.951 --> 00:19.684
Mal:
Zevon, stop!

00:19.719 --> 00:22.921
Zevon:
Well, if it isn't the evil
Isle twins.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.123
Kapow!

00:26.593 --> 00:29.327
Or should I say the formerly
evil Isle twins

00:29.362 --> 00:31.596
now that Auradon
has made you soft.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.433
I mean,
not soft like a kitten
or something, but...

00:34.468 --> 00:36.034
well, you know what I mean.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.235
(grunting)

00:37.270 --> 00:38.937
You have to stop this, Zevon.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.238
Come down here and talk to us.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.407
My, how times have changed.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.443
Mal wants to talk to me.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.744
I have to admit,
there was a time

00:45.779 --> 00:48.180
when I hung
on your every word.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.281
You two had a thing?

00:49.316 --> 00:52.684
No! No. He had like a crush
on me, or something.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.252
But not any more.

00:54.287 --> 00:55.754
You totally
missed your chance, Mal.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.625
Now, each jewel I add
increases my power

01:00.660 --> 01:02.360
and when I've
combined them all,

01:02.395 --> 01:05.864
this antenna will transmit
my spell across all of Auradon,

01:05.899 --> 01:07.399
to make everyone evil.

01:08.768 --> 01:11.203
Well we are never going
to let that happen.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.305
Twist of hand
and twist of fate.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.273
Leave the ground
and levitate.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.942
Whoa!

01:16.977 --> 01:20.145
Can't use the antenna
if you can't touch it. Ha ha.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.280
You always were
the clever one, Mal.

01:22.315 --> 01:24.817
Clever, enchanting,
and doomed.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.787
(evil laugh)

01:28.822 --> 01:31.056
-Whoa!
-Evie.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.492
(grunts and moans)

01:33.527 --> 01:35.594
Try, but you will
never harm her.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.296
Buried under suits of armor.

01:40.967 --> 01:42.601
(clanging)

01:42.636 --> 01:44.302
-Seriously?
-What?

01:44.337 --> 01:45.637
It was all I could think of.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.806
Don't force me
to destroy you, Mal.

01:47.841 --> 01:48.940
Ka-slice!

01:48.975 --> 01:51.176
Hey, you don't
want to hurt me, Zevon.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.310
I mean, come on.

01:52.345 --> 01:54.146
We could trade spells and...

01:54.181 --> 01:56.081
potions all day, but eventually

01:56.116 --> 01:57.616
Evie and I will win.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.683
You're bluffing, right?

01:58.718 --> 01:59.751
Oh, yeah, totally.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.086
Give up, Zevon.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.287
You're outnumbered.

02:02.322 --> 02:03.688
Wrong again.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.257
I knew I might need backup

02:05.292 --> 02:08.627
so that's why I broke into
Geppetto's Workshop.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.529
Ah, ha ha hey!

02:10.564 --> 02:11.596
(both laugh)

02:11.631 --> 02:13.999
You're going to stop us
with a puppet show?

02:14.034 --> 02:16.334
Not quite. Ba-bam!

02:16.369 --> 02:17.569
Pa-Pow!

02:21.408 --> 02:24.476
(evil laughter)

02:24.511 --> 02:27.479
Okay, yeah,
I see what you did there.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.214
(screeching)

02:29.249 --> 02:31.216
Who's pulling the strings now?

02:31.251 --> 02:32.684
(evil laugh)
