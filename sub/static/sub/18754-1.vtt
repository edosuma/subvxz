00:36.269 --> 00:39.105
Hi, my name's Jack Jericho.

00:41.274 --> 00:44.527
Hi. Hi, my name's Jack Jericho.

00:44.610 --> 00:49.949
Has anyone ever told you you have the face
of a Botticelli and the body of a Degas?

01:15.725 --> 01:18.436
Hi. Hi. Hi.

01:18.519 --> 01:20.229
Hi.

01:20.313 --> 01:23.566
Hi. Hi.

01:37.997 --> 01:41.584
Forgive me for intruding on you,
but I may never run into you again

01:41.667 --> 01:46.130
and may never know who you are so we
can fulfil our destiny together on this planet.

01:52.637 --> 01:56.099
What's your name? Eileen? Eileen?

01:56.182 --> 01:59.811
God. Great name. God, brilliant name.

02:15.952 --> 02:17.995
What's that?

02:19.122 --> 02:23.292
How kind, really.
God, I love the way you said that.

02:24.293 --> 02:29.173
Eileen, can I be bold enough
to ask you for your phone number?

02:30.299 --> 02:34.095
Write it down? I have a photographic
memory for everything important.

02:34.178 --> 02:38.558
If your number isn't the most important seven
digits in the cosmos, I don't know what is.

03:16.512 --> 03:20.266
Look, I must run, but let me assure you...

03:20.349 --> 03:23.561
this is only the beginning.

03:25.521 --> 03:28.900
Excuse me. My name's Jack Jericho.
I saw what you just did.

03:28.983 --> 03:34.697
I want to say one thing, then I'll disappear
and we'll never see each other again, OK?

03:34.781 --> 03:37.575
- I love how you say that. What's your name?
- Karen.

03:37.658 --> 03:39.494
Karen. That's a phenomenal name.

03:39.577 --> 03:42.705
Here's what was on my mind.
I think you should get a medal.

03:42.789 --> 03:46.334
You were brave, graceful and totally right.
I wish I had a camera.

03:46.417 --> 03:49.128
Guys like that
give meeting strangers a bad name.

03:49.212 --> 03:53.841
It was a personal affront to me cos
I have a vested interest in meeting strangers.

03:53.925 --> 03:58.638
Every woman that I've ever liked,
communed with or given great satisfaction to

03:58.721 --> 04:01.766
started off as a stranger,
and only became known to me

04:01.849 --> 04:06.145
because I followed the impulse I felt
when I saw her, and said, politely:

04:06.229 --> 04:09.273
"Hi, I'm Jack Jericho. I like you.
Do you like me?"

04:09.357 --> 04:13.069
In the name of men who truly appreciate,
desire and respect women,

04:13.152 --> 04:20.243
allow me to apologise for that buffoon,
and to wish you great luck and good fortune.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.745
Wait. Jack.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.833
- Yeah.
- That was very nice. Thank you.

04:26.916 --> 04:30.086
- You're welcome. May I ask you a question?
- OK.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.046
- Can I have your number?
- Got a pen?

04:32.130 --> 04:34.674
I have a memory.
I never forget something important.

04:34.757 --> 04:39.178
- 689-2751.
- Great pleasure meeting you.

04:39.262 --> 04:41.264
- Bye, Jack.
- Bye, Karen.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.100
689-2751. Karen.

04:44.183 --> 04:49.188
Hi. My name's Jack Jericho. I couldn't help
noticing this outfit and the way you walk,

04:49.272 --> 04:52.400
which is very exciting,
and your terrific haircut,

04:52.483 --> 04:54.652
and this great-looking dog. Hi.

04:54.736 --> 04:56.487
- Is he dangerous?
- Depends.

04:56.571 --> 04:59.073
- My name's Jack Jericho.
- You said that.

04:59.157 --> 05:01.534
- I did. What's your dog's name?
- Caligula.

05:01.617 --> 05:03.536
Great name. And yours?

05:03.619 --> 05:05.496
Doesn't really matter, does it?

05:05.580 --> 05:09.250
Not at all. Maybe we'll
run into each other again sometime.

05:13.504 --> 05:15.590
- First American colony.
- Jamestown.

05:15.673 --> 05:18.342
- What year?
- 1607.

05:20.511 --> 05:22.346
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:22.430 --> 05:25.308
- Stan wants to see you.
- When?

05:25.391 --> 05:29.729
Tomorrow morning. He's meeting the board
today to decide next year's faculty.

05:29.812 --> 05:33.316
- Of which I am or am not going to be a part?
- Doesn't look good.

05:33.399 --> 05:36.069
- Why? What happened?
- He wouldn't tell me.

05:36.152 --> 05:40.698
- Thinks I tell you everything he says.
- You do, don't you?

05:40.782 --> 05:42.575
Thanks.

05:43.618 --> 05:46.996
- How do you do that?
- I could eat fire for you, Pat.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.665
- I better go straighten out Stan.
- Bye.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.543
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Billy.

05:52.627 --> 05:56.964
- Throat's spelled o-a-t.
- My brother sucks at spelling.

05:57.048 --> 05:59.675
- You weren't in school yesterday.
- Hi, Stan.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.637
I had a sore throat. That's my excuse.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.889
- Where are your parents?
- London.

06:04.972 --> 06:07.600
- Pat said you want a word with me.
- I'm afraid so.

06:07.683 --> 06:13.147
Talk to me. Richie, take Paul and Terry.
Get the equipment. Baseball in three minutes.

06:13.231 --> 06:15.733
OK, Mr Jericho.

06:16.401 --> 06:21.030
Jack, does the name Doris Merchant
mean anything to you?

06:21.114 --> 06:24.409
Doris... Doris, Doris, Doris, Doris...

06:24.492 --> 06:27.578
The mother of Stephen Merchant Jr.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.833
- He's in my third-grade...
- Gym class.

06:31.916 --> 06:34.168
Did you tell Stephen Merchant's mother

06:34.252 --> 06:38.881
that she had the face of a Chagall
and the body of a Rubens?

06:38.965 --> 06:41.050
Did you?

06:41.134 --> 06:45.555
Jack, you might also want to know
that her husband, Stephen Merchant Sr,

06:45.638 --> 06:50.017
is head of the organised-crime unit
in the Manhattan DA's office.

06:50.101 --> 06:53.604
Is there a crime against
comparing a woman to a work of art?

06:53.688 --> 06:58.526
Watch it, Jack, or you're gonna end up
losing more than yourjob one of these days.

06:58.609 --> 07:03.406
And another thing, Chagall's women
aren't beautiful, and Rubens' women are fat.

07:04.949 --> 07:08.745
Did anyone tell you you've
the face of a Botticelli and body of a Degas?

07:09.287 --> 07:10.371
The what of a who?

07:10.455 --> 07:14.292
Has anyone said you have a magnificent
smile and skin invented to be touched?

07:14.375 --> 07:17.879
- No one who wasn't trying to pick me up.
- And would that be a sin?

07:17.962 --> 07:22.425
- A mistake.
- Desire is never a mistake. Only rejection is.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.802
It isn't going to happen.

07:24.886 --> 07:28.765
How can you say that
when your face is bubbling with curiosity?

07:28.848 --> 07:34.228
Because my boyfriend's gonna be back
any minute and if I'm not here he'll kill me.

07:34.312 --> 07:38.733
- If you're not here, how will he kill you?
- He'll find me. He has a lot of influence.

07:38.816 --> 07:43.613
He's in there right now
with the second-richest man in Colombia.

07:43.696 --> 07:47.658
Really? Perhaps
they should mambo together.

07:47.742 --> 07:50.495
- What's your name?
- Lulu.

07:50.578 --> 07:53.331
Lulu?

07:53.414 --> 07:57.752
- That's the most erotic name I've ever heard.
- You better get inside.

07:58.211 --> 08:02.256
What will I find inside
that I haven't found in you? Name one thing.

08:02.340 --> 08:06.010
- It's too late now.
- For what? Who's this?

08:06.094 --> 08:10.556
Lulu, I want you to say hello to Carla.
She's a lingerie designer.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.603
- Whatever you're selling, we don't want any.
- I don't sell or buy. I just give and take.

08:15.686 --> 08:18.439
Is that so?

08:18.523 --> 08:20.650
How would you like to take a beating?

08:20.733 --> 08:26.823
There's a polite way of doing things and
a rude way. I don't respond to the rude way.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.992
I do respond to death threats.
Should I move on?

08:30.076 --> 08:32.953
Get the hell out of here.

08:33.037 --> 08:35.414
Make her feel at home.

09:06.612 --> 09:11.951
Look, Fernando, I have just the girl for you.
Her name is Carla. She's waiting in the car.

09:12.034 --> 09:14.954
I told you, I want the redhead.

09:15.037 --> 09:19.375
She's different from the others.
I thought there was to be no problem.

09:19.459 --> 09:23.713
Fernando, whatever you want,
you're gonna have.

09:26.674 --> 09:30.595
You know how much money I stand to make
off this guy if I can keep him happy?

09:30.678 --> 09:35.266
- What if she don't go for it?
- She has no choice.

09:57.371 --> 10:01.000
Don't get mad at me, OK?
I'm Lulu, Alonzo's girlfriend.

10:01.084 --> 10:06.255
I don't think you know what you're saying no
to when you say no to Fernando Portacarrero.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.299
Fernando isn'tjust rich.

10:08.382 --> 10:13.513
If he was just rich, I'd tell you to say, "Take
a hike, buster", but he isn'tjust rich, he's rich.

10:13.596 --> 10:18.267
<i>They're gonna do a whole segment on him
for Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.</i>

10:18.351 --> 10:22.939
Look, I don't know you,
but I don't care how rich he is.

10:25.817 --> 10:27.985
Then why am I here?

10:28.069 --> 10:31.280
Because someone important to me
owes Alonzo a lot of money.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.409
Alonzo thinks he can scare me
into going with Fernando.

10:34.492 --> 10:37.870
Alonzo didn't say anything
about scaring anybody.

10:37.954 --> 10:39.914
Well, what would you call it?

10:39.997 --> 10:45.169
I'd call it trying to talk somebody into going
out with someone rich for their own good.

10:45.253 --> 10:48.548
I mean, rich is better than poor
no matter what, isn't it?

10:48.631 --> 10:51.300
You don't have
any objections to money, do you?

10:51.384 --> 10:54.846
For that kind of money I'll bet
you've put up with worse. I have.

10:54.929 --> 11:01.185
I don't care how rich he is.
For me, sex and money just don't mix.

11:01.269 --> 11:04.647
Now I see what you're saying.

11:05.314 --> 11:07.692
Boy, is Alonzo gonna be furious.

11:07.775 --> 11:10.862
You know who ought to be furious?
You, with Alonzo.

11:10.945 --> 11:14.907
- Why?
- For sending you on an errand like this.

11:22.957 --> 11:25.501
Hi. Are you OK?

11:25.585 --> 11:28.379
Yeah, I'm leaving right now.

11:28.463 --> 11:32.550
OK. I'll pick some up on the way home. Bye.

11:32.633 --> 11:35.261
- Get in the car.
- As soon as she gets out.

11:35.344 --> 11:38.973
- Shut your face, Lulu.
- Didn't anybody teach you manners?

11:39.056 --> 11:43.436
- Don't bust my bones. Get in the car.
- Would you get in and give up the space?

11:43.519 --> 11:46.981
- What?
- If you're gonna leave, leave now.

11:47.065 --> 11:51.402
- Why?
- I've known Alonzo for three years...

11:51.486 --> 11:55.823
I haven't taken care of you yet, wise guy.
Who do you think you're talking to?

11:55.907 --> 11:59.619
- Forget it.
- He won't know your name tomorrow.

11:59.702 --> 12:02.997
- Now move.
- Oh, yeah? Fat chance.

12:03.081 --> 12:04.707
Get in the car.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.711
- Not until she gets out.
- Don't come home.

12:14.509 --> 12:17.762
You don't see anything
attractive about her, do you?

12:17.845 --> 12:21.182
- Who?
- Carla, the girl Alonzo went off with.

12:21.265 --> 12:24.727
Are you crazy? Next to you?
She's a pearl next to a swine.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.604
I mean a swine next to a pearl.

12:26.687 --> 12:29.690
You wouldn't go near
a creep like her, would you?

12:29.774 --> 12:32.777
Not with a switchblade to my Adam's apple.

12:32.860 --> 12:38.825
If Alonzo thinks I'll ever speak to him
again, he's crazier than people think he is.

12:38.908 --> 12:42.912
- What's his name? Alonzo?
- Bet your bottom dollar on it.

12:42.995 --> 12:47.250
- I don't gamble.
- I hope he doesn't see us here.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.962
What are you talking about?
You saw the way I handled him.

12:51.045 --> 12:55.633
Besides, you're in my house now,
and I am the master of my house.

12:55.716 --> 13:00.346
Police! All right, get out of the car.
Come on. Hands over your heads.

13:00.430 --> 13:02.515
- I can't believe this!
- Hands on the hood.

13:02.598 --> 13:07.437
- Haven't you heard of the Fifth Amendment?
- First Amendment. For privacy, go to a motel.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.106
- I'm broke.
- I suppose you're broke too?

13:10.189 --> 13:12.316
- Not exactly.
- What do you mean?

13:12.400 --> 13:17.697
Would you excuse me forjust one second?
What does "not exactly" mean?

13:17.780 --> 13:19.574
- I have a little cash.
- 20? 10?

13:19.657 --> 13:21.576
- Only hundreds.
- How many?

13:21.659 --> 13:24.328
- Six, but they're Alonzo's.
- In your purse?

13:24.412 --> 13:27.373
- Do you want to spend the night in jail?
- No way.

13:27.457 --> 13:29.959
Give me a hundred.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.507
Do you have change of a hundred?

13:36.591 --> 13:40.720
Thanks for helping out.
By the way, what happened to Lester?

13:40.803 --> 13:44.474
- Gluckman? He retired last week.
- Send him my best.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.144
You know what I really like about you?

13:48.227 --> 13:52.315
You would never take a baseball bat
and break some poor guy's kneecaps

13:52.398 --> 13:54.525
just cos he said a few words to me.

13:54.609 --> 13:56.944
- Are you talking about Alonzo?
- Yeah.

13:57.028 --> 14:01.949
Sometimes he'll follow me around all night in
his car, hoping he'll catch me with some guy.

14:02.033 --> 14:06.621
- Would you mind if I dropped you off here?
- Not at all.

14:07.872 --> 14:11.751
- How will we meet each other again?
- The same way we met tonight. Fate.

15:13.938 --> 15:17.358
So, honey,
how much time are they giving me?

15:17.859 --> 15:20.695
- I'm handling it, Dad.
- How?

15:20.778 --> 15:23.489
Dad, I'm handling it.

15:53.936 --> 15:56.564
You must have been out late last night.

15:56.647 --> 16:00.777
I woke up several times and looked in
to say hello, but you weren't there.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.363
I was out with friends.
What happened? Did anything go wrong?

16:04.447 --> 16:07.784
- I mean, did you need my help?
- I was fine.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.536
- That's it?
- I'm full.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.498
- I'll have to get rid of half the insulin.
- Great.

16:13.581 --> 16:17.710
- So eat the Fruitful Bran.
- No more room.

16:17.794 --> 16:21.089
Grandma, two bites of toast,
three sips of orange juice?

16:21.172 --> 16:24.050
That's not enough for a growing girl.

16:25.176 --> 16:27.720
OK, now, brace yourself.

16:33.434 --> 16:35.937
Now we get to play "let's find the digoxin".

16:36.020 --> 16:39.315
- They were right there on the table.
- When was that?

16:39.399 --> 16:41.901
Not long ago.

16:43.361 --> 16:47.990
With medication you have to be precise.
One little mistake can do monstrous harm.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.826
How'd you sleep?

16:49.909 --> 16:51.994
So many dreams, Jackie.

16:52.453 --> 16:56.958
Your mother in the convertible Plymouth,
looking younger than you do.

16:57.041 --> 17:01.003
- And dinner with Fritz.
- Fritz?

17:01.087 --> 17:04.714
He's from Vienna. You wouldn't know him.

17:04.799 --> 17:07.009
- Are you all right, Jackie?
- Great.

17:07.093 --> 17:11.638
You don't know a diabetic crazy enough
to eat a bunch of chocolate bars, do you?

17:11.722 --> 17:14.599
No. No, that would be insane.

17:14.684 --> 17:17.520
Here they are. Here, take your pill.

17:23.984 --> 17:26.738
Look. Now, what are these?

17:47.383 --> 17:49.552
Celia! Hi!

17:49.635 --> 17:51.637
It's Jack Jericho.

17:51.721 --> 17:54.307
How's tonight for you?

17:54.390 --> 18:00.688
I was thinking we could take a drive,
take a walk. We can do whatever you want.

18:00.772 --> 18:05.443
Hi. I'm back. No, that was the phone.
I'm in the shower.

18:05.526 --> 18:07.320
I beg your pardon?

18:07.403 --> 18:11.699
This is Jack Jericho -
the guy you liked on the street the other day.

18:11.783 --> 18:16.204
I came up and told you you had the face
of a Botticelli and the body of a De... Hello?

18:16.287 --> 18:18.414
Celia?

18:18.623 --> 18:20.374
Celia?

18:48.111 --> 18:50.863
Mr Jericho, just the man I wanted to see.

18:50.947 --> 18:54.117
- I'll have your rent on Friday.
- You said that last week.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.286
Could I possibly squeeze by?
I'm running late.

18:57.370 --> 19:01.749
I don't care. You're running late with me
and I'm gonna get tough - legal tough.

19:01.833 --> 19:04.961
- The same thing happens every month.
- It's frustrating.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.296
- For me.
- Me too. I hate being late.

19:07.380 --> 19:12.051
That's what I'm telling you. Lateness is time,
time is money, money is life.

19:12.135 --> 19:15.513
- Change your habits.
- I like your mind, George. Do you write?

19:15.596 --> 19:20.518
Yeah, bills. It's for your own good I'm leaning
on you, so just remember money is life.

19:20.601 --> 19:23.730
You're right. Absolutely right.

19:32.739 --> 19:38.244
Wow, that's a phenomenal smile. Has anyone
ever said you look like a Picasso painting?

19:38.327 --> 19:41.038
- Not exactly.
- Why? Are you an artist yourself?

19:41.122 --> 19:43.082
No, but I have posed for artists.

19:43.166 --> 19:46.377
- Really? Scintillating. What's your name?
- Mona.

19:46.461 --> 19:50.214
<i>Great name - like Henry Miller's girlfriend
in Tropic of Cancer.</i>

19:50.298 --> 19:52.633
In Paris in the '20s, everybody got off.

19:52.717 --> 19:55.845
Two people would be walking,
they'd connect eyes,

19:55.928 --> 19:58.514
then boom, they'd go berserk on each other.

19:59.223 --> 20:01.642
That's two 50-to-one shots you're betting.

20:01.726 --> 20:04.812
- How are you, Bruce?
- Healthier than those two horses.

20:04.896 --> 20:07.273
I need long shots. I need a lot of money fast.

20:07.356 --> 20:12.028
- Is Flash in trouble again?
- Like everybody else.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.322
- What do you do?
- I'm studying to be a priest.

20:14.405 --> 20:20.328
No shit! I was just reading an article about the
shortage of priests, especially female priests.

20:20.411 --> 20:25.958
- It's gonna get a lot better.
- I hope so. Can I ask a personal question?

20:26.042 --> 20:31.589
Before you take your vows, do you need to
cleanse your system of your fantasies and...

20:31.672 --> 20:36.219
Go with them? Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I have a tremendous need for that.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.763
Will you permit me
to make a bold suggestion?

20:38.846 --> 20:42.475
I wish I could. That's my bus.

20:43.434 --> 20:46.938
Mona! Does the convent
have a phone number?

20:47.021 --> 20:49.232
Bless you.

20:49.273 --> 20:51.275
How about I cook you dinner tonight?

20:51.359 --> 20:54.445
- What time is the race?
- You don't know what you're missing.

20:54.529 --> 20:56.322
- 3:30.
- See you, Bruce.

20:56.406 --> 20:57.865
Randy.

21:18.428 --> 21:21.431
- Hey, Jack.
- Hi, Harry.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.811
- Hold these for collateral.
- Yeah, go. Run, run.

21:31.065 --> 21:34.694
This bud's for you. My name's Jack Jericho.

21:34.777 --> 21:40.575
That rose goes magnificently with your
pale skin, dark eyes, pink lips and red hair.

21:40.658 --> 21:43.995
Did anyone tell you you've the face
of a Botticelli and body of a Degas?

21:44.078 --> 21:46.873
Yeah, my tenth-grade art teacher.

21:46.956 --> 21:51.711
- You want to see something strange?
- Need you ask?

21:51.794 --> 21:54.964
Holy shit! Is this an omen or is this an omen?

21:55.047 --> 21:59.135
- It's weird.
- This whole thing is a mysterious omen.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.471
- It's weird.
- May I ask you a question?

22:01.554 --> 22:03.556
As long as it's personal.

22:03.639 --> 22:05.808
- Great answer.
- What's the question?

22:05.892 --> 22:11.147
I recognise the Botticelli, but what
are these books on gambling doing here?

22:11.230 --> 22:13.524
For a friend.

22:17.320 --> 22:21.824
May I ask you another question? What
do you think of a stranger giving you a rose?

22:21.908 --> 22:24.494
With that opening,
there's nowhere to go but down.

22:24.577 --> 22:27.622
Never underestimate
the power of strangers buying flowers.

22:27.705 --> 22:29.624
- What's your name?
- Randy.

22:29.707 --> 22:34.837
Great name. It's original for a female-looking
girl. May I ask you one last question?

22:34.921 --> 22:38.758
What if this stranger were to say
something really outrageous like:

22:38.841 --> 22:45.098
"You're the most lovely, exotic, erotic woman
I've ever met and I must make love to you"?

22:45.181 --> 22:47.517
- What would you do?
- Depends where he said it.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.813
- You wouldn't want to see if you liked him?
- I'd know after two seconds.

22:51.896 --> 22:55.983
- Don't say that unless you're serious.
- Test me.

23:06.202 --> 23:11.874
There's a special place I'm gonna take you.
It's very private, very hidden.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.877
- Wanna know where?
- Surprise me.

23:22.051 --> 23:25.179
This never happens. This very rarely happens.

23:25.263 --> 23:31.102
I have a perfect communion with this car.
Itjust needs a little foreplay.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.777
Try it again. It'll work now.

23:45.450 --> 23:50.204
- Do you have magic powers?
- I guess we'll know soon enough.

23:50.288 --> 23:52.749
Did anyone tell you
you're too good to be true?

23:52.832 --> 23:55.793
No, only that I'm too truthful to be good.

23:55.877 --> 23:58.004
Great line. Wow.

23:58.087 --> 24:03.384
You're smart, aren't you? Did you
go to college? No? That's very exciting.

24:03.468 --> 24:07.472
Wow, intelligence to me
is just the greatest stimulant there is.

24:07.555 --> 24:11.601
There's nothing
more stimulating than... than...

24:11.684 --> 24:15.563
- What are you looking at?
- Your legs, and I'm not afraid to admit it.

24:15.646 --> 24:18.107
I thought my intelligence stimulated you.

24:18.191 --> 24:23.529
It does. I've always responded to women
with intensity, but in the past it's been mixed.

24:23.613 --> 24:27.992
I love the arms, but I hate the voice.
I love the voice, but I hate the mind.

24:28.076 --> 24:33.998
Then I have to concentrate on the one thing
that excited me in order to get going.

24:34.082 --> 24:38.461
With you it's different. Everything excites me.

24:38.544 --> 24:42.507
- What are you thinking?
- I'm wondering if we'll sit here until winter.

24:58.439 --> 25:01.692
You're wonderful.
Do you have any idea how great you feel?

25:01.776 --> 25:04.320
You're like silk, you're like cream.

25:04.404 --> 25:08.282
Do you love the way that feels?
Does that hurt?

25:08.366 --> 25:12.745
Are you sure? God, this is paradise, isn't it?

25:12.829 --> 25:16.374
Could you move your arm?
My spine is snapping on the brake.

25:16.457 --> 25:18.668
- How's that?
- Fine.

25:18.751 --> 25:25.091
Is there anything that could make this
moment any more perfect than it is now?

25:25.174 --> 25:31.973
Just one. If you could keep quiet
for the next 15 seconds, I'll come.

25:37.770 --> 25:41.315
It's ten o'clock. She should be here.

25:49.282 --> 25:54.036
This is definitely gonna go down in history
as one of the high points of my life.

25:54.495 --> 25:57.206
Well, I'm glad I could oblige.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.502
Do you feel great?

26:01.586 --> 26:03.796
- I feel fine.
- Not great?

26:03.880 --> 26:06.132
Would it upset you if I chose my own words?

26:06.215 --> 26:10.803
Absolutely not. Look, I gotta get to work,
but let me get your phone number.

26:10.887 --> 26:13.055
No, I can't.

26:13.139 --> 26:16.809
- Why? Are you married? Boyfriend?
- No.

26:16.893 --> 26:21.814
Then what's your problem?
I can fit it right here. See?

26:23.900 --> 26:26.569
The fit is not the problem.

26:29.947 --> 26:31.866
What is?

26:31.949 --> 26:35.495
- I don't give out my number.
- After what we've just been through?

26:35.578 --> 26:39.207
That was in the past.
A phone number's in the future.

27:06.734 --> 27:09.612
- How are we gonna see each other again?
- We aren't.

27:09.695 --> 27:12.949
- I thought we loved it.
- Don't worry. You'll recover.

27:13.032 --> 27:17.870
You probably hit on 30 girls a day. I'm sure
at least one says yes, so by tomorrow...

27:17.954 --> 27:23.126
Did you say one for 30? One for 30? A
leprous warthog does better than one for 30.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.503
A warthog doesn't come on 30 times a day.

27:25.586 --> 27:27.505
- Why do you think I do?
- Instinct.

27:27.588 --> 27:30.341
- Where are you going?
- Work. Walking distance.

27:30.425 --> 27:34.637
- What's your last name? Can you tell me?
- I can, but I'm not going to.

27:35.763 --> 27:38.433
Were you faking it?

27:38.516 --> 27:42.061
No, I had a lovely time. Thank you very much.

27:45.314 --> 27:47.608
Hey! Randy!

28:02.039 --> 28:03.916
Randy.

28:05.543 --> 28:10.089
- If he doesn't cooperate, it'll get much worse.
- I have to go.

28:11.007 --> 28:13.676
Let go of me! I'll get your money, OK?

28:21.517 --> 28:25.855
- What do you want to see first?
- The dinosaurs. They're extinct.

28:25.938 --> 28:29.817
- Why should we see them?
- Maybe they won't be here next time.

28:29.901 --> 28:33.071
- Sidney, are the cheques ready yet?
- Not till tonight.

28:33.154 --> 28:36.365
- Are you sure?
- Would I lie to you about a cheque?

28:36.449 --> 28:39.077
Thanks.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.288
Hi, can you hold these for me till later?

28:47.335 --> 28:52.548
Hi, I'm Randy Jensen, and I'm your guide.
We can start in the dinosaur hall. Follow me.

28:59.889 --> 29:05.269
Excuse me. I'd like to make an appointment
for a group tour. Can that be arranged?

29:05.353 --> 29:07.647
Anything can be arranged, within reason.

29:07.730 --> 29:11.442
- May I request a particular guide?
- Sure. Who'd you have in mind?

29:11.526 --> 29:13.236
- Randy Jensen?
- Jensen?

29:13.319 --> 29:15.988
The lady you were looking at,
with the red hair?

29:16.072 --> 29:18.157
How's two o'clock this afternoon?

29:18.241 --> 29:22.161
- No batter!
- Batter, batter, batter!

29:22.245 --> 29:24.122
Yeah! Beauty!

29:24.205 --> 29:28.501
- Great hit, Richie.
- Great pitch. You put it right where I like it.

29:28.584 --> 29:30.420
Angie, keep your eye on the ball.

29:30.503 --> 29:34.465
OK, no batter, no batter.
Automatic out. No batter.

29:34.549 --> 29:37.427
- Why didn't you swing?
- You said to keep my eye on it.

29:37.510 --> 29:41.723
- Yeah, then you gotta swing, OK?
- Stupid dumbo! Stupid dumbo!

29:41.806 --> 29:43.057
Charlie.

29:43.141 --> 29:46.185
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry to me.

29:46.853 --> 29:50.106
- I'm sorry, Angie.
- It's OK, Charlie.

29:50.189 --> 29:53.151
OK, Angie, watch the ball.
Focus your attention.

29:53.234 --> 29:56.946
That's all you guys have to do -
baseball, math, book reports,

29:57.029 --> 30:00.908
just focus your energy,
concentrate on one object.

30:00.992 --> 30:04.162
All right? Ready?

30:04.245 --> 30:07.123
Yeah! See, you just zero in and do it.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.000
All right, hustle up.

30:09.083 --> 30:14.505
OK, that's it for baseball, gang.
Everyone gather round. I got a big surprise.

30:14.589 --> 30:18.718
You guys have been after me
to go to the Museum of Natural History.

30:18.801 --> 30:20.887
I won't tell you unless you be quiet.

30:45.036 --> 30:46.746
Quiet.

30:49.624 --> 30:54.253
Good afternoon, Ms Jensen. May I ask you
a question? Did anyone ever tell you...

30:54.337 --> 30:58.841
That I have the face of a Botticelli?
Some guy used that on me this morning.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.761
OK, everybody, follow me.

31:02.887 --> 31:05.556
- What did you think?
- You could take him or leave him.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.559
- What would you do?
- Probably take him and leave him.

31:08.643 --> 31:11.187
- You sound cold.
- You have to be with guys like that.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.315
- Like what?
- Cruisers, collectors, pick-up artists.

31:14.399 --> 31:18.694
Guys who carry a list of numbers so long,
they don't know if they did or didn't.

31:18.778 --> 31:21.989
- That's all you thought he was?
- That's all I saw.

31:22.073 --> 31:26.702
Maybe he wants to make sure
that it's the angel of his dreams before...

31:26.786 --> 31:30.748
- Sounds like one of his one-liners.
- You're putting down one-liners?

31:30.832 --> 31:34.252
Author of, "I'm not too good to be true,
only too truthful to be good. "

31:34.335 --> 31:39.048
We could cause each other a lot of trouble.
Who knows the name of this dinosaur?

31:39.132 --> 31:42.969
- Brontosaurus.
- That's it. Brontosaurus.

31:43.052 --> 31:47.974
It's believed to be one of the biggest animals
that walked on Earth. It was 70 feet long

31:48.057 --> 31:52.270
and 50 tons - that's 100,000 pounds.

31:52.729 --> 31:56.774
Do you know what the odds are against
two strangers seeing each other twice

31:56.858 --> 31:59.402
in a city of eight million human beings?

31:59.485 --> 32:01.904
- Eight million to one.
- Four million to one.

32:01.988 --> 32:05.199
That's my point.
Isn't this more than coincidence?

32:05.283 --> 32:09.036
Did you ever hear
John Calvin's theory of predestination?

32:09.120 --> 32:11.914
- You're talking religion?
- Make fun, go ahead.

32:11.998 --> 32:14.542
But don't expect this mysterious force

32:14.625 --> 32:19.797
that brought us together to wait to guide us
together again. It's got others to connect.

32:19.881 --> 32:24.135
- Yes, other romantic visionaries.
- Yeah. How do you mean that?

32:24.218 --> 32:27.221
- I have another tour.
- I have a social-studies class.

32:27.305 --> 32:30.808
We'll have to wait till dinner.
How about after dinner?

32:30.892 --> 32:34.645
- Are you like this with all pick-ups?
- You're not a pick-up.

32:34.729 --> 32:37.857
- What do you want from me?
- Dinner.

32:38.483 --> 32:43.154
I see. You have to feel that what I'm saying
to you I've never said to anyone else.

32:43.237 --> 32:46.157
Take out your telephone directory.

32:49.827 --> 32:52.538
Tear it up.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.625
Tear it up? What... what is that gonna...

32:57.460 --> 33:00.838
You think this list
means anything to me? Look.

33:01.506 --> 33:03.508
Here.

33:05.593 --> 33:07.428
Is everyone here?

33:07.512 --> 33:11.140
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Several tours started late today.

33:11.224 --> 33:13.976
My name is Randy Jensen.
I'm gonna be your guide.

33:14.060 --> 33:17.146
- Excuse us. One second.
- Excuse me.

33:17.230 --> 33:20.400
- What do you want from me?
- Your absence.

33:21.609 --> 33:23.444
- You mean it?
- Yes.

33:23.528 --> 33:25.696
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

33:25.780 --> 33:28.032
You want me to leave you alone?

33:28.116 --> 33:30.368
Yes.

33:31.911 --> 33:34.247
OK. Fine.

33:35.373 --> 33:37.667
Come on. Let's go.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.699
- Grandma, what are you doing?
- About what?

34:09.782 --> 34:12.118
- Why are you so dressed up?
- Am I?

34:12.201 --> 34:16.581
- Yeah. You got some special plans?
- Oh, yes. There's a man I met.

34:16.664 --> 34:18.958
The nicest young man.

34:19.041 --> 34:23.755
- Ah, Fritz from Vienna.
- No, Serge from Central Park.

34:23.838 --> 34:25.797
But he's from Vienna too.

34:25.882 --> 34:28.342
Serge Handfeld.

34:28.426 --> 34:31.054
- You met him in Central Park?
- On the park bench.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.223
- Handfeld? Did he ask you where you live?
- Yes.

34:34.306 --> 34:37.643
- And you told him?
- Of course. It isn't any secret, is it?

34:37.726 --> 34:40.688
What does he do?
Does he have ajob? How does he live?

34:40.772 --> 34:42.648
What do you know about this guy?

34:42.732 --> 34:45.650
- His clothes are very nice.
- Oh, that's reassuring.

34:45.735 --> 34:50.197
Till it blows over, sit in another part
of the park. I don't want him bothering you.

34:50.281 --> 34:53.701
- It's no bother. He's taking me to dinner.
- Serge Handfeld?

34:53.784 --> 34:57.497
- What's his number? I'll call and cancel.
- I don't know his number.

34:57.580 --> 35:03.336
- He didn't give you his number?
- I don't need it. He's going to pick me up.

35:03.419 --> 35:05.963
I'll call in 90 minutes. If you're not home...

35:06.047 --> 35:08.800
It'll mean that things are going very well.

35:10.093 --> 35:11.803
Serge Handfeld.

35:48.965 --> 35:51.050
How about an orange juice?

35:51.134 --> 35:54.011
For you, anything.
How about a pretzel to wash it down?

35:54.095 --> 35:59.142
No. Low fibre. I'm getting grainy wheats and
bran. Stuff that rockets through your system.

35:59.225 --> 36:03.062
Pretzels clog up your colon triglycerides.

36:03.146 --> 36:05.022
One can't hurt.

36:08.359 --> 36:11.696
Can I let you in on a little secret?
Lt'll help if you chew it.

36:12.155 --> 36:16.325
- No time. I gotta find ajob.
- You've got ajob.

36:16.409 --> 36:19.328
- I could be more helpful at another school.
- What?

36:19.412 --> 36:22.415
- I got a warning.
- Jack, you're a great teacher.

36:22.498 --> 36:25.084
I am ahead of my time.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.047
- Good afternoon, ladies.
- Hi.

36:30.131 --> 36:32.008
- What's your name?
- Michelle.

36:32.091 --> 36:34.343
- And yours?
- Joan.

36:34.427 --> 36:37.805
Did you hear the way she said that?
What do you do for a living?

36:37.889 --> 36:41.017
- Model.
- Am I a moron? Of course you're models.

36:41.100 --> 36:44.395
Jack, is there a desert
you wouldn't walk across

36:44.479 --> 36:48.649
to spend five minutes
with either of these devastating beauties?

36:48.733 --> 36:51.110
Thanks, Phil.

36:59.744 --> 37:02.330
He's shy.

37:03.289 --> 37:06.417
- Hi. Can I get my things?
- Yeah.

37:07.543 --> 37:08.878
- Thanks.
- Sure.

37:08.961 --> 37:11.672
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

40:02.427 --> 40:04.637
Randy!

40:05.638 --> 40:07.515
Randy!

40:09.392 --> 40:12.520
- What are you doing?
- I want to make sure you're all right.

40:12.603 --> 40:15.732
- I'm fine.
- Who is this guy?

40:15.815 --> 40:19.527
- I have to talk to you.
- Jack, I have to want you to act this way.

40:19.610 --> 40:21.446
- You do.
- I don't.

40:21.529 --> 40:24.282
- I'm coming up.
- No!

40:25.742 --> 40:27.618
Why am I so confused?

40:27.952 --> 40:30.204
Your mother said I shouldn't be a father.

40:30.288 --> 40:32.457
- Please.
- Your mother was right.

40:32.540 --> 40:36.961
Daddy, please,
will you just try to clean yourself up?

40:38.755 --> 40:42.091
- Jack, you can't stay here. You have to go.
- He just got here.

40:42.175 --> 40:45.970
- He has to go.
- Maybe he'd like a drink before he goes.

40:46.054 --> 40:48.556
- Thanks.
- What's your pleasure?

40:48.639 --> 40:52.226
We got Johnnie Walker Red,
Johnnie Black, beer, wine...

40:52.310 --> 40:56.189
There are things going on that
you know nothing about. You have to go.

40:56.272 --> 40:57.732
- Can I say one thing?
- No.

40:57.815 --> 41:00.693
- OK. Don't expect to ever see me again.
- I won't.

41:00.777 --> 41:02.945
This is a tragic mistake.

41:03.029 --> 41:05.615
- What's going on?
- Oh, shit.

41:05.698 --> 41:08.534
- Are you and your boyfriend in trouble?
- Come on.

41:08.618 --> 41:12.663
- You must be. I know you're in trouble.
- Don't say a word.

41:12.747 --> 41:15.792
I'm not blind.
I know you're in some kind of trouble.

41:15.875 --> 41:17.877
- Tell me the facts...
- Shut up!

41:35.728 --> 41:37.980
- Where's the lush?
- I don't know.

41:38.064 --> 41:39.816
- Atlantic City? Vegas?
- No.

41:39.899 --> 41:43.486
If you don't know where he is,
how do you know he isn't in Vegas?

41:43.569 --> 41:45.863
I'll have your money by noon tomorrow.

41:45.947 --> 41:48.908
How? You gonna
bet some more horses at OTB?

41:48.991 --> 41:51.702
- I'll get it.
- What if you don't?

41:51.786 --> 41:56.290
I want my money. You want to keep Flash
from getting mangled? I offered a way out.

41:56.374 --> 42:00.378
Portacarrero is a handsome guy.
Women fall at his feet.

42:00.461 --> 42:03.589
- What do women do when they see him?
- Fall at his feet.

42:03.673 --> 42:07.677
I seen it. They chase him.
He doesn't chase them. They chase him.

42:07.760 --> 42:10.346
OK, can you please leave now?

42:13.933 --> 42:17.520
The offer holds, butjust for tonight.

42:17.979 --> 42:20.481
- Am I being fair?
- More than fair.

42:20.565 --> 42:23.401
You're not a virgin,
so why do you come on like one?

42:23.484 --> 42:27.780
- Why are you being so stupid?
- I don't do anything I don't want to do.

42:27.864 --> 42:34.954
Then find a way to want to. It won't be hard.
Fernando likes you. He's... What's the word?

42:35.037 --> 42:39.125
- Crazy.
- Obsessed. He's become obsessed with you.

42:39.208 --> 42:41.711
Spend a night with the guy. Make him happy.

42:41.794 --> 42:44.589
You can make a lot of money from this guy.

42:44.672 --> 42:47.717
You want his money, you date him.

42:47.800 --> 42:52.597
Excuse me. Are you getting wise with me?
Are you getting wise with me?

42:53.056 --> 42:54.849
OK.

42:54.932 --> 42:57.560
How much money
are we talking about here? Huh?

42:57.643 --> 43:00.271
- What are you? Glue?
- How much?

43:03.399 --> 43:05.485
25,418.

43:08.404 --> 43:11.157
Not a problem. I'll take care of it.

43:14.202 --> 43:17.246
- What's your profession, cupcake?
- I'm a romantic.

43:17.330 --> 43:19.415
That's lucrative. Where's the cash?

43:19.499 --> 43:23.086
- Do you mean is it on me?
- On you, off you, up you.

43:23.711 --> 43:27.590
Did you ever hear
of Serge Handfeld from Austria?

43:27.673 --> 43:33.930
We're like this. I'll have the money tomorrow.
Randy knows where to find you, doesn't she?

43:39.310 --> 43:42.438
Noon. Tomorrow.

43:54.617 --> 43:57.203
And not a minute later.

44:03.709 --> 44:06.754
- Who's Serge Handfeld?
- Serge? He's...

44:06.838 --> 44:09.382
- Where the hell can you get $25,000?
- Where?

44:09.465 --> 44:12.468
Is everything ajoke?
You couldn't stay in the closet.

44:12.552 --> 44:14.887
- And not help you?
- I don't want your help.

44:14.971 --> 44:19.517
Now, wait a minute, honey.
Let's not be hasty.

44:19.600 --> 44:25.398
Well, this guy Jimmy's got a lot of heart.
A lot of positive energy coming off him.

44:25.481 --> 44:28.025
But we don't want to block up his orgones.

44:28.109 --> 44:32.363
I don't believe we've been introduced.
I'm Jack Jericho. Jack, not Jimmy.

44:32.447 --> 44:34.824
Yeah. No offence intended. Flash.

44:34.907 --> 44:37.702
- Can you please leave now?
- Absolutely.

44:37.785 --> 44:41.289
I want you to know our relationship
has been one of friendship.

44:41.372 --> 44:46.627
Jimmy, whatever. This Australian count
that you were talking about -

44:46.711 --> 44:49.881
can he really come up with
the $25,000 overnight?

44:49.964 --> 44:52.967
- May I say one thing?
- You're not gonna pay off our debt.

44:53.051 --> 44:55.178
Randy, be rational for a second.

44:55.261 --> 45:00.016
He wants to save us from disaster.
It would be bad karma to say no to him.

45:00.099 --> 45:02.935
- May I say one thing?
- No. I won't accept your help.

45:03.019 --> 45:09.358
That's what I'm trying to say. There's nothing
to accept. Serge Handfeld is as broke as I am.

45:10.860 --> 45:13.321
How can he be broke?

45:13.404 --> 45:17.575
Only ten minutes ago,
he was the richest man in Yugoslavia.

45:18.785 --> 45:23.372
How long have you been with this guy? Why
do you keep ditching me? I'm trying to help.

45:23.456 --> 45:28.669
- Why would you want to help me?
- I like you. Today in the park was brilliant.

45:28.753 --> 45:31.380
- Are you saying I'm your first good time?
- No.

45:31.464 --> 45:34.050
- I'm trying to get you out of a mess...
- You can't.

45:34.133 --> 45:37.345
- Who's Flash, by the way?
- I don't have time for this, OK?

45:37.428 --> 45:40.723
Flash is totally wrong for you.
That's all I have to say.

45:40.807 --> 45:43.434
- You don't know anything.
- I don't know anything?

45:43.518 --> 45:48.189
If I win you a teddy bear, we'll spend
the night together. If not, I'll leave you alone.

45:48.272 --> 45:51.609
- Big gambler, huh?
- How many to win a big one?

45:51.692 --> 45:57.156
You gotta get three out of three.
It's a quarter a pop.

46:11.087 --> 46:13.339
I can do this with my eyes closed.

46:13.423 --> 46:17.051
Swish. One down. Two to go.

46:19.470 --> 46:21.347
Swish.

46:28.730 --> 46:31.023
Wanna try again?

46:40.241 --> 46:42.660
- I lost the bet, but I'll go with you.
- Where?

46:42.744 --> 46:44.454
Wherever. You need me.

46:45.371 --> 46:51.544
I don't know how long you've been together.
It's noble to take on your boyfriend's debt.

46:51.627 --> 46:53.671
A lot of people would be...

47:40.301 --> 47:43.304
- What?
- You're completely crazy.

47:47.183 --> 47:51.437
...the 19th century.
A man who had outgrown his fear of space...

47:51.521 --> 47:55.233
- Is this the way to the museum?
- No, the planetarium.

47:55.316 --> 47:57.902
- Excuse me.
- Excuse us.

47:57.985 --> 48:04.409
- I really don't know what the point of this is.
- Neither do I, but we're on the right track.

48:04.492 --> 48:07.370
- Are the cheques ready?
- Yeah. They're upstairs.

48:07.453 --> 48:11.082
- Are you gonna stay for the show?
- Yeah.

48:11.165 --> 48:13.251
Come on.

48:17.964 --> 48:21.384
The Earth is a speck of dust,

48:21.467 --> 48:26.848
rotating in a solar system
itself no more than specks of dust

48:26.931 --> 48:29.517
floating in a galaxy,

48:29.600 --> 48:33.354
again, one among billions
and billions of other galaxies

48:33.438 --> 48:35.606
expanding without restraint

48:35.690 --> 48:40.027
in a universe 20 billion years old.

48:40.111 --> 48:43.614
The stars, planets and galaxies

48:43.698 --> 48:46.325
hurtle themselves recklessly outward -

48:46.409 --> 48:49.537
colliding, dying,

48:49.620 --> 48:53.416
regenerating themselves
as new forms of matter

48:53.499 --> 48:56.586
whose only law is constant...

48:56.669 --> 48:58.212
Wait. I'll be right back.

48:58.296 --> 49:00.757
Boundless darkness,

49:00.840 --> 49:03.885
blinding light, eerie silence,

49:03.968 --> 49:07.513
deafening noise, violent eruptions,

49:07.597 --> 49:10.266
harmonious peace.

49:41.714 --> 49:45.176
Hey! Slow down! Slow down!

49:57.480 --> 49:59.357
Randy!

50:23.381 --> 50:28.052
- Hey, Jack.
- I can't believe I'm doing this. I need $25,418.

50:28.136 --> 50:31.764
- What?
- This girl and her boyfriend need $25,418

50:31.848 --> 50:33.725
for these gangsters by tomorrow.

50:33.808 --> 50:35.643
- That's not your problem.
- It is.

50:35.727 --> 50:39.272
Why do you need that kind of money
for somebody else's girlfriend?

50:39.355 --> 50:41.566
This is crazy, Jack. Come in.

50:59.333 --> 51:02.837
Will you please move your leg?

51:02.920 --> 51:09.177
Hey, wait. Wait, baby. Where are you going?
Come on back here. Come on.

51:13.014 --> 51:14.640
- Hi.
- Hi.

51:14.724 --> 51:20.271
You move your purse so a guy can sit down
and he thinks you're inviting him to Hawaii.

51:20.354 --> 51:23.941
Do you believe that creep? Look.

51:24.025 --> 51:26.319
He thinks I'm playing hard to get.

51:26.402 --> 51:29.530
Boy, men are pretty dumb, aren't they?

51:31.032 --> 51:33.367
Are you going to Atlantic City?

51:33.451 --> 51:36.370
- Sugarless mint?
- Thanks.

51:39.707 --> 51:41.084
- Jack.
- Yeah.

51:41.167 --> 51:43.795
You've never said anything like this before.

51:43.878 --> 51:47.256
I'm touched. I'm moved.

51:47.340 --> 51:51.094
- I wish I could sell my joint to get you...
- I don't want you to do that.

51:51.177 --> 51:53.388
Where is she? We gotta find her now.

51:53.471 --> 51:58.101
You can't lose this girl. You've got
lightning in a bottle. I'm going with you.

51:58.184 --> 52:02.230
- No, I gotta go alone.
- No. I'll give you all the support you need.

52:02.313 --> 52:06.609
Have you got any idea what kind of a guy
this boyfriend of hers is?

52:06.692 --> 52:08.861
No. He's a lot older than she is.

52:08.945 --> 52:11.531
You can'tjump to conclusions about her

52:11.614 --> 52:14.575
cos she got involved
with a guy who's not right for her.

52:14.659 --> 52:17.203
The point is she's right for you.

52:18.037 --> 52:20.331
Come on. Tell me where she is.

52:20.415 --> 52:24.710
What's your pleasure? Johnnie Black?
Johnnie Walker Red?

52:24.794 --> 52:27.922
Flash, come on, please, OK?
This is really important.

52:28.005 --> 52:31.634
Try to remember.
Atlantic City, right? Where in Atlantic City?

52:32.093 --> 52:35.096
- Tell me your name one more time.
- Jack.

52:35.179 --> 52:38.474
- How old is she in this picture?
- Flash.

52:38.558 --> 52:40.768
The time we took her to Monte Carlo?

52:40.852 --> 52:43.187
- Flash?
- 12, 13, maybe.

52:43.271 --> 52:46.983
You took this girl to Monte Carlo
at the age of 13?

52:47.066 --> 52:50.945
- What hotel? You know where it is?
- It's got some of the...

52:51.028 --> 52:55.241
Jack, please. Move to Mars
before you follow this girl one more inch.

52:55.324 --> 52:58.953
- And this was Harry?
- Steve.

52:59.036 --> 53:01.497
- Your second husband?
- Second boyfriend.

53:01.581 --> 53:06.586
Ed was my second husband.
Harry was my first boyfriend. This was Steve.

53:06.669 --> 53:09.130
- So what did you do?
- I broke his nose.

53:09.213 --> 53:13.676
- And that was the last time you saw him?
- Are you kidding?

53:13.760 --> 53:17.221
You kept seeing him and he did it again?

53:17.305 --> 53:19.807
Of course.

53:19.891 --> 53:22.643
- How soon?
- Oh, I've no idea.

53:22.727 --> 53:25.480
Probably with the nurse who fixed his nose.

53:25.563 --> 53:29.942
It may sound naive, but have you considered
not getting involved with these men?

53:30.026 --> 53:32.236
- Which men?
- All of them.

53:32.320 --> 53:34.322
Come on, now.

53:34.405 --> 53:37.116
- Men can be a lot of fun.
- Well, fine, fine.

53:37.200 --> 53:39.911
Good, take the fun, but why get all involved?

53:39.994 --> 53:42.789
Why depend on them? Why trust them?

53:42.872 --> 53:48.753
So they can let you down just when you
thought that you could count on them?

53:48.836 --> 53:51.547
Do you live with a guy?

54:25.873 --> 54:28.000
I'll need to see some ID.

54:28.960 --> 54:32.463
Look at whatjust walked into the casino.

54:33.464 --> 54:36.134
Keep an eye on her.

54:36.217 --> 54:41.013
- How would you like your chips?
- Five hundreds and a 25.

54:44.016 --> 54:45.893
Have a nice evening.

54:51.399 --> 54:55.027
This is Patsy Cappalluso.
Is Alonzo Scalera there?

54:55.111 --> 54:57.029
12.

54:57.113 --> 54:59.365
Break. Player loses.

54:59.449 --> 55:01.534
11.

55:01.617 --> 55:03.828
- Double.
- Double down.

55:03.911 --> 55:06.956
10 makes 21. Dealer has 20.

55:07.039 --> 55:10.501
Player wins. $400.

55:20.470 --> 55:24.807
- Does Randy gamble regularly?
- Does she gamble? Are we there?

55:24.891 --> 55:30.855
- No. We're at a gas station. We need gas.
- Randy is a mystery. Jimmy, to be honest...

55:30.938 --> 55:34.692
- Regular, please. My name's Jack.
- Whatever.

55:34.776 --> 55:39.781
Do me a favour, turn the car around.
Come on. It's not too late.

55:39.864 --> 55:41.908
She won't want us to be there.

55:42.366 --> 55:46.287
What are we doing? Let's get out of here.
I feel like getting loaded.

55:46.370 --> 55:49.665
- Sounds good to me.
- Player wins. $1200.

55:49.749 --> 55:51.918
You want a drink?

55:52.001 --> 55:54.587
All bets down, please.

55:56.839 --> 55:59.801
Are we lepers?
You don't talk to your friends any more?

55:59.884 --> 56:02.428
- Good to see you.
- This is Mr Portacarrero.

56:02.512 --> 56:05.264
Mr Portacarrero,
anything you want, let me know.

56:05.348 --> 56:07.767
500 on each hand.

56:07.850 --> 56:10.186
Blackjack. Blackjack.

56:10.269 --> 56:13.564
Player wins. $750 on each hand.

56:13.648 --> 56:16.651
Pay $1500.

56:16.734 --> 56:20.279
Hey, Alonzo. She's over there.
Gambling and winning.

56:20.363 --> 56:24.283
Oh, yeah? Play the slot machines, Lulu.
Wait here, Frank.

56:24.367 --> 56:26.244
Fernando.

56:29.539 --> 56:33.918
Forget it. I'm running a business here, Jerry,
not a charity ball. Understand?

56:34.001 --> 56:35.503
Hold on a minute.

56:35.586 --> 56:41.384
- Gino, this is Fernando Portacarrero.
- I heard about you.

56:41.467 --> 56:44.887
- She's in the blackjack area.
- I'll be at the tables.

56:44.971 --> 56:46.848
I'll find you. I'll be over here.

56:46.931 --> 56:49.726
Card here?

56:49.809 --> 56:52.854
Dealer gets 15. Dealer breaks.

56:52.937 --> 56:57.275
Player wins. 500 here. 500 here. 1,000.

56:57.358 --> 57:01.154
Pull up over here. This is where she'll be.
I can almost guarantee it.

57:01.237 --> 57:03.114
Careful.

57:09.579 --> 57:11.664
Bets, please.

57:14.500 --> 57:16.586
13,000.

57:21.883 --> 57:24.802
You want to bet the $13,000 on one hand?

57:24.886 --> 57:27.096
Uh-huh.

57:27.180 --> 57:29.557
Wait right here.

57:32.226 --> 57:36.189
She always plays blackjack. Right over here.

57:36.272 --> 57:38.816
A special area in the back.

57:42.945 --> 57:46.324
- Come on, let's go.
- Flash. Flash.

57:46.407 --> 57:49.160
- Long time. How you been?
- Hey, Patsy!

57:49.243 --> 57:51.871
I'm in and out. You're looking great.

57:51.954 --> 57:55.249
Hey, I try my best. I do whatever I have to do.

57:55.333 --> 57:57.251
- This is my friend Jimmy.
- Jack.

57:57.335 --> 57:59.837
- And Paul.
- Phil.

57:59.921 --> 58:04.175
- You know the boys, don't you?
- I sure do. How's life, fellas?

58:04.258 --> 58:10.098
1979. Remember? The man could not lose
a bet. For 21 straight weeks, he was a winner.

58:10.181 --> 58:13.434
- Am I right or am I right?
- I was a legend, wasn't I?

58:13.518 --> 58:17.939
- I won a half a million dollars.
- It's not what you win, it's what you keep.

58:18.022 --> 58:19.107
Ain't that true.

58:19.190 --> 58:21.901
The girl is Randy Jensen.
She's ahead $13,000.

58:21.984 --> 58:24.821
She wants to bet it all
on one hand of blackjack.

58:24.904 --> 58:26.447
Yeah, OK.

58:26.531 --> 58:29.867
- Hey, Gino. Excuse me. You can't do that.
- I just did.

58:29.951 --> 58:33.663
- You know what I'd love to do?
- No, what?

58:33.746 --> 58:35.832
Turn back the clock.

58:35.915 --> 58:38.501
What are you gonna do
now that Randy's grown up?

58:38.584 --> 58:42.338
What will you do when she's
out on a date with one of her boyfriends?

58:42.422 --> 58:44.841
I get real confused about that.

58:44.924 --> 58:48.594
That's OK, Flash. With a daughter like Randy,
I'd be confused too.

58:48.678 --> 58:51.681
- Let's have a drink.
- I got booze upstairs.

58:51.764 --> 58:55.226
Did you hear that?
It's not her boyfriend. It's her father.

58:55.309 --> 58:57.353
Come on. I got everything you need.

58:57.437 --> 59:01.190
That's not her boyfriend.
Watch Flash. I gotta find Randy.

59:06.988 --> 59:12.160
- Have you seen Randy around here?
- Randy? Sure. She went down here.

59:12.243 --> 59:14.746
- Here?
- Yeah, sure.

59:24.172 --> 59:26.799
Get lost.

59:27.967 --> 59:30.344
Right in here.

59:35.058 --> 59:36.934
Sit down.

59:46.069 --> 59:49.322
- It's OK. Go ahead and deal.
- All right.

59:59.665 --> 01:00:02.335
12. Want a card?

01:00:04.712 --> 01:00:07.048
15.

01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:10.093
Take your time.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.679
You want another card?

01:00:16.057 --> 01:00:18.101
You'll stand on that?

01:00:19.936 --> 01:00:22.480
Ten.

01:00:24.482 --> 01:00:27.568
The dealer has 21.

01:00:51.175 --> 01:00:54.804
- Jack! They got him.
- Who?

01:00:54.887 --> 01:00:57.306
Flash. They stuck the pistol in my ribs.

01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:01.811
- Where'd they take him?
- I don't know. Somewhere in the hotel.

01:01:06.983 --> 01:01:12.655
You bear a striking resemblance to a young
lady who ditched me at the planetarium.

01:01:12.739 --> 01:01:15.283
You haven't seen her
in the casinos, have you?

01:01:15.366 --> 01:01:18.786
I thought that we were
getting into something exceptional.

01:01:20.413 --> 01:01:23.833
I don't believe it. I just can't believe it.

01:01:23.916 --> 01:01:28.504
Everything I did in there was right -
doubling up, standing, taking hits.

01:01:28.588 --> 01:01:33.426
I came here with $500 and in one hour I have
$13,000 cash. You know how hard that is?

01:01:33.509 --> 01:01:38.473
Do you have any idea? Wait a minute.
Where am I going? I don't believe this.

01:01:38.556 --> 01:01:41.893
Oh, I could have killed that dealer.
Did you see his face?

01:01:41.976 --> 01:01:45.605
How could I have blown it? Just one ace.

01:01:46.731 --> 01:01:49.776
- Wait. Is this the way out?
- Where do you want to go?

01:01:49.859 --> 01:01:51.652
- To the bus.
- Bus to where?

01:01:51.736 --> 01:01:54.030
Home, to get Flash out of town.

01:01:54.113 --> 01:01:55.990
Here.

01:01:56.074 --> 01:01:58.785
My grandmother takes this.

01:02:01.329 --> 01:02:04.457
You don't understand what this feels like.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:08.127
I've been doing double shifts,
I've been betting on horses.

01:02:08.211 --> 01:02:12.757
I take everything I've got and I lost it all
in there, cos I really thought I had it.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.594
- I don't know what else to do now.
- Listen.

01:02:18.554 --> 01:02:21.599
Why don't you try gambling on me?

01:02:22.975 --> 01:02:26.270
I'm serious. What have you got to lose?

01:02:31.567 --> 01:02:34.862
Admit you don't have things
under control for once in your life.

01:02:34.946 --> 01:02:39.492
For once in my life? How the hell would you
know about my life? We just met yesterday.

01:02:39.575 --> 01:02:44.122
- You don't know me.
- Is it too much to ask to get to know you?

01:02:44.205 --> 01:02:46.708
- Why?
- Why?

01:02:50.753 --> 01:02:52.463
Yeah?

01:02:52.547 --> 01:02:55.258
- Just come here.
- Where?

01:02:58.845 --> 01:03:02.014
- How old are you?
- Why?

01:03:02.098 --> 01:03:04.475
Just how old?

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:06.811
19. Why?

01:03:06.894 --> 01:03:09.313
- You're too old.
- For what?

01:03:09.397 --> 01:03:14.277
To live like his little girl. You think you live
with Flash cos you want to take care of him?

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.321
The truth is you're just scared to leave.

01:03:17.405 --> 01:03:22.535
Don't you think it's time that you got out
on your own, gave yourself a chance?

01:03:22.618 --> 01:03:27.206
If you don't want to gamble on me,
gamble on yourself.

01:03:29.167 --> 01:03:34.672
By the way, has Flash been your boyfriend
for the whole 19 years?

01:03:41.387 --> 01:03:46.100
Look, I never told you that Flash
was my boyfriend. I just didn't correct you.

01:03:46.184 --> 01:03:50.855
- Fine. Get in.
- So who do you live with? Alone?

01:03:50.938 --> 01:03:54.484
As a matter of fact,
I live with an older woman.

01:03:54.567 --> 01:03:57.445
My, my, my. How old?

01:03:57.528 --> 01:03:59.322
Older.

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:14.921
So you've lived with your grandmother
since you were nine?

01:04:15.004 --> 01:04:17.090
I was positive you lived in this car.

01:04:17.173 --> 01:04:20.551
- It's the only place I have privacy.
- Where are we going?

01:04:20.635 --> 01:04:22.011
I'm sick of privacy.

01:04:24.305 --> 01:04:27.141
- What gives the biggest payout?
- Roulette.

01:04:27.225 --> 01:04:30.353
- How much does it pay?
- 35 to one.

01:04:33.606 --> 01:04:38.361
- Hi, how are you? I'm Marty Copland.
- Hi. Your sign says you buy cars.

01:04:38.444 --> 01:04:44.992
Cars, yeah, but interest in a Camaro
convertible happens to be at an all-time low.

01:04:45.076 --> 01:04:48.371
- So you're not interested?
- That's not what I said.

01:04:48.454 --> 01:04:52.542
What I said was the Camaro convertible
is at an all-time low.

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:56.295
No. That's absurd.
This is a phenomenal car, a collector's item.

01:04:56.379 --> 01:05:01.008
- Come on, Jack. Let's just go.
- That's the oldest trick in the business.

01:05:01.092 --> 01:05:02.969
- How much do you want?
- 6,000.

01:05:03.052 --> 01:05:05.972
Six? Not a penny over four.

01:05:17.442 --> 01:05:21.571
- 4,000 sounds reasonable.
- 2950.

01:05:21.654 --> 01:05:26.033
- One little stall, you think that's worth 1,050?
- You can say the magic word.

01:05:26.117 --> 01:05:28.035
- What's that?
- No.

01:05:28.494 --> 01:05:30.580
OK, no.

01:05:33.416 --> 01:05:36.002
2950 cash?

01:05:36.085 --> 01:05:39.172
Why not? This is Atlantic City, isn't it?

01:05:39.255 --> 01:05:44.635
You know what I'd rather have right now
than $2950? A cheeseburger.

01:05:44.719 --> 01:05:50.183
When I was 19, I went through a period where
everything seemed hopeless. It gets better.

01:05:50.266 --> 01:05:52.518
- How old are you now?
- 21.

01:05:52.602 --> 01:05:56.314
You know what this cheeseburger's like? Life.

01:05:56.397 --> 01:06:01.402
You look at it, touch it, chew it, swallow it,
add ketchup, take a second bite, third bite.

01:06:01.486 --> 01:06:05.948
You never think you'll be looking at
an empty plate. Next thing you know, that's it.

01:06:06.032 --> 01:06:08.076
- No more burger.
- So order another.

01:06:08.159 --> 01:06:11.579
No, there are no others.
You've eaten the last burger on Earth.

01:06:12.038 --> 01:06:15.792
- So you order a hot dog.
- No, you face the truth.

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:19.003
You admit you're tapped out,
and you say, "Never again. "

01:06:19.087 --> 01:06:22.382
"If I get off this time,
either I move on or I die. "

01:06:22.465 --> 01:06:26.719
- If you want my cheeseburger, just say so.
- Let's go.

01:06:28.554 --> 01:06:30.181
- What's your lucky number?
- 11.

01:06:30.264 --> 01:06:32.850
- Mine's 13.
- What else would it be?

01:06:32.934 --> 01:06:35.478
- How much does it pay?
- 35 to one.

01:06:35.561 --> 01:06:38.564
35 to one? 35 to one. Right, 35 to one.

01:06:38.648 --> 01:06:41.067
OK, wait. 35 to one.

01:06:42.985 --> 01:06:47.115
- Place your bets.
- My lucky number and yours.

01:06:47.198 --> 01:06:51.452
- I put a thousand on me, 1950 on you.
- Why not half on each?

01:06:51.536 --> 01:06:55.164
- I'm the amateur.
- OK, here we go.

01:07:02.922 --> 01:07:05.633
No more bets, please.

01:07:20.064 --> 01:07:21.607
13, black, odd.

01:07:21.691 --> 01:07:24.652
$35,000!

01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:36.581
I'm gonna go settle this up.

01:07:38.875 --> 01:07:40.877
Jack!

01:07:51.054 --> 01:07:54.182
- Thank you.
- I'll be right back.

01:08:11.908 --> 01:08:14.744
$25,418.

01:08:18.956 --> 01:08:22.001
- Fernando.
- Where's Flash?

01:08:22.752 --> 01:08:26.631
- With friends. The way we all should die.
- We had a deal.

01:08:27.256 --> 01:08:28.966
- You'll get him.
- When?

01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:33.179
- When Randy starts behaving.
- Are you referring to Mr Portacarrero?

01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:38.600
Get lost, cupcake, unless you want
your neck separated from your face.

01:08:47.068 --> 01:08:49.404
What is this shit?

01:08:49.487 --> 01:08:54.200
I pay off a $25,000 debt,
and for that, you're gonna kill me?

01:08:54.283 --> 01:08:56.953
What do I get for 50,000?
Sodomy and mutilation?

01:08:57.036 --> 01:09:01.457
You're a crook! You're worse than a crook
because you're a cheap, lying crook.

01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:05.461
All I have to do is make
one phone call to Serge Handfeld,

01:09:05.545 --> 01:09:08.506
and you'll do 20 years
for kidnapping and extortion.

01:09:08.589 --> 01:09:13.344
I've seen your kind all my life.
Everybody has, Hot Lonnie Scalera.

01:09:13.428 --> 01:09:17.140
He's a pick-up artist.
He hits on women. He walks, he talks.

01:09:17.223 --> 01:09:21.894
He jumps them in the back of his car,
then takes their number and never calls.

01:09:21.978 --> 01:09:24.147
Admit it, Hot Lonnie.

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:28.693
Does your mother do your laundry?
Does she wash lipstick off your underpants?

01:09:28.776 --> 01:09:31.779
- Excuse me.
- No, you excuse me, you son of a bitch.

01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:34.282
It's your mother.

01:09:35.366 --> 01:09:40.997
I bet you got a list of all the women
that you've done this to in your back pocket.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.542
- Could I take a look at the list?
- What list?

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:48.296
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Gino.

01:09:48.379 --> 01:09:52.383
- I don't like that kind of talk. It's disgusting.
- Gino...

01:09:52.466 --> 01:09:55.094
Shut up. Do what Mr Jericho says.

01:09:55.178 --> 01:09:57.555
Return the gentleman to his daughter.

01:09:57.638 --> 01:10:01.184
Jack! What a surprise!

01:10:03.811 --> 01:10:06.898
What's going on?

01:10:40.098 --> 01:10:42.183
Hi.

01:10:42.266 --> 01:10:44.227
Here I am.

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.562
- How are you feeling?
- Fine. You?

01:10:46.646 --> 01:10:48.940
Fine.

01:10:49.023 --> 01:10:50.858
You were wonderful.

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:52.902
Thanks.

01:10:53.361 --> 01:10:56.739
So what are you gonna do now?

01:10:56.823 --> 01:11:01.327
I'm gonna buy back my Camaro
and take you anywhere you wanna go.

01:11:01.411 --> 01:11:05.873
You've done too much. I have to get back
to the city and make sure everything's OK.

01:11:05.957 --> 01:11:11.379
Actually, I meant anywhere you want to go
for the rest of your life.

01:11:11.462 --> 01:11:13.256
You're shameless.

01:11:13.339 --> 01:11:16.968
Is rain wet? Is London English?
Does popcorn pop? What else is new?

01:11:17.051 --> 01:11:20.680
I don't know where I want to go.
I'm going in the wrong direction.

01:11:20.763 --> 01:11:22.515
Am I a wrong direction?

01:11:22.598 --> 01:11:26.185
We're both running around
taking chances we can't get away with.

01:11:26.269 --> 01:11:31.315
- We got away with it tonight.
- So what if we did? We shouldn't have tried.

01:11:31.399 --> 01:11:34.736
I'll always be grateful to you,

01:11:34.819 --> 01:11:38.239
but we're not good for each other.

01:11:38.322 --> 01:11:41.868
So in other words, because of tonight,
I shouldn't be with you.

01:11:41.951 --> 01:11:44.287
- We shouldn't be with each other.
- Why?

01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:46.205
You're just as big a gambler as I am

01:11:46.289 --> 01:11:51.002
and we're just gonna keep making each other
take chances that we can't get away with.

01:11:51.085 --> 01:11:54.338
I'd have been on your list,
you wouldn't have come to my house.

01:11:54.422 --> 01:11:56.299
None of this would've happened.

01:11:56.382 --> 01:12:01.137
- And we wouldn't have won.
- Well, so what if we did?

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:04.766
It was wonderful once, but it was dumb luck.
Can't you see that?

01:12:05.224 --> 01:12:10.104
That's all there is to it.
I mean, we're just not good for each other.

01:12:10.188 --> 01:12:14.025
I'm sorry.
You can't live your life gambling like that.

01:12:14.108 --> 01:12:20.073
Being with you isn't a gamble! You can
only gamble when you have a choice.

01:12:20.156 --> 01:12:24.786
I... I want to be with you forever
and I don't have a choice about that.

01:12:25.369 --> 01:12:29.374
Maybe I don't have a prayer in the world,
but it's not a gamble.

01:12:29.457 --> 01:12:31.376
Maybe what I feel is not good for us,

01:12:31.459 --> 01:12:36.464
but I'm not gonna stand there
and listen to you tell me it's a bad habit.

01:12:41.636 --> 01:12:44.389
Speaking of bad habits...

01:12:44.472 --> 01:12:47.183
I don't need this any more.

01:13:02.281 --> 01:13:04.117
Daddy, what are you doing here?

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.079
- You know Patsy Cappallucci, don't you?
- Cappalluso.

01:13:08.162 --> 01:13:10.206
Of course. Cappalluso.

01:13:10.289 --> 01:13:13.251
No offence intended.

01:13:13.334 --> 01:13:17.880
- Come on, let's go.
- All right. Good night.

01:13:17.964 --> 01:13:20.383
He means well.

01:13:23.344 --> 01:13:26.180
Well, you know something?

01:13:26.264 --> 01:13:28.433
I can't do this any more.

01:13:28.516 --> 01:13:31.060
Sorry.

01:13:38.526 --> 01:13:40.987
Come on.

01:14:35.333 --> 01:14:38.586
- Jackie.
- Hi, Grandma.

01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:42.382
This is Serge Handfeld, from Vienna.

01:14:42.465 --> 01:14:44.425
That's my grandson.

01:14:44.509 --> 01:14:46.177
Hi.

01:14:46.386 --> 01:14:48.805
Hi.

01:14:48.888 --> 01:14:51.432
Nice to meet you.

01:14:51.516 --> 01:14:57.021
I won't bother you guys.
I'm just gonna move my car.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.906
Hi, I'm Jack Jericho.

01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:14.831
This has gone far enough. If you don't have...

01:15:14.914 --> 01:15:17.542
- I got it.
- You do? You have the rent?

01:15:17.625 --> 01:15:19.419
Yeah. Right here.

01:15:19.502 --> 01:15:21.087
$1,000 in cash?

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:24.257
I got 2,000-
for last month, this month, right?

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.135
You must have struck it rich!

01:15:28.302 --> 01:15:31.013
One, two, three...

01:15:36.769 --> 01:15:39.647
Excuse me.

01:15:39.731 --> 01:15:44.026
Has anyone ever told you
you have crazy taste in women?

01:15:47.071 --> 01:15:49.031
What's wrong?

01:15:49.115 --> 01:15:53.327
I was perfectly happy with my life
two days ago, now everything's screwed up.

01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:56.414
I was thinking about what you said
and I was hoping...

01:15:56.497 --> 01:15:58.499
No.

01:15:58.583 --> 01:16:02.128
It's not worth it. We'd annihilate each other.

01:16:03.755 --> 01:16:06.174
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

01:16:06.257 --> 01:16:11.345
- See, you're playing with me.
- You just said we'd annihilate each other.

01:16:11.429 --> 01:16:13.514
Well, we would.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.768
- Wouldn't we?
- I don't know.

01:16:16.851 --> 01:16:22.065
We would. It's much better for both of us
in the long run if we just split up right now

01:16:22.148 --> 01:16:24.859
and never see each other again.

01:16:25.985 --> 01:16:28.279
- OK.
- OK.

01:16:28.738 --> 01:16:30.615
Bye.

01:16:41.459 --> 01:16:44.170
- What do you want from me?
- Dinner.

01:16:44.921 --> 01:16:49.801
We could cause each other a lot of trouble,
you know that?

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.644
Come on. Let's eat.
