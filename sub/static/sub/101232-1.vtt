WEBVTT

01:11.471 --> 01:17.811
All hail the Leader Zupreme!

01:19.563 --> 01:20.606
<i>And?</i>

01:21.189 --> 01:22.274
And, uh...

01:22.733 --> 01:25.569
And, uh...

01:26.028 --> 01:28.697
Ultimate Ruler of the Galaxy!

01:28.780 --> 01:31.867
Ultimate Ruler of the Galaxy, and...

01:31.950 --> 01:33.952
And, uh...

01:35.037 --> 01:36.038
And, uh...

01:36.580 --> 01:41.919
Ultimate Ruler of the Galaxy
he's about to destroy!

01:57.476 --> 01:59.853
I couldn't have said it better myself.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.521
Showtime.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.285
Okay, good to go.

02:15.619 --> 02:18.080
All righty.

02:18.163 --> 02:20.666
Test. Test. Test.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.794
Stop moving the camera, Lackey.

02:24.294 --> 02:26.922
Calling all losers.

02:27.005 --> 02:29.299
Galactic Patrol, that means you.

02:32.636 --> 02:36.640
<i>Did you really think
your puny Alcatron prison could hold me,</i>

02:36.723 --> 02:40.435
<i>the galaxy's greatest evil genius?</i>

02:40.519 --> 02:44.523
<i>Now I'm back on my </i>Doomstar,

02:44.606 --> 02:49.403
and I have perfected
my terrifying Time Trap.

02:49.987 --> 02:53.031
<i>Let me give you
an example of what I mean.</i>

02:53.532 --> 02:56.577
<i>See this here?
I think you'll probably recognize it.</i>

02:56.660 --> 02:59.246
<i>You see, just like I was in a prison,</i>

02:59.329 --> 03:04.251
<i>imagine the whole galaxy
stuck in a moment of time forever.</i>

03:04.459 --> 03:08.130
<i>There will be no escape for you.</i>

03:08.630 --> 03:11.425
<i>So, please, try and stop me,</i>

03:13.302 --> 03:14.636
losers.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.097
Come on.

03:17.180 --> 03:20.142
What is wrong
with the gravity in the ship, Lackey?

03:20.225 --> 03:21.602
Cut it!

03:23.061 --> 03:26.440
Is it possible that B'kr has perfected
a Time Trap device?

03:26.523 --> 03:29.526
I must answer by saying
I am not the one to ask.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.819
Then who?

03:30.903 --> 03:34.114
The legendary being
who first thought of trapping time itself.

03:34.198 --> 03:36.867
Of course. Ah-rit Alber Ite,

03:36.950 --> 03:39.119
the original Time Strider.

03:39.203 --> 03:40.746
Our new mission is clear.

03:40.829 --> 03:43.832
To save the galaxy,
we must find him at once.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.210
Not to beat around the bush,

03:46.293 --> 03:48.921
but it's been years
since we've had contact with Ah-rit.

03:49.004 --> 03:50.047
Plink!

03:50.130 --> 03:53.467
He could be anywhere,
so what course should I set?

03:53.550 --> 03:55.886
We must first look
where we know he is not.

03:56.428 --> 03:59.806
Planet Earth, where the young
Deputy Allbright saw his father last,

03:59.890 --> 04:02.643
and who may hold the key
as to where he is now.

04:03.435 --> 04:05.270
And with the threat of
time running out forever,

04:05.354 --> 04:08.899
we must proceed at maximum speed to Earth
no matter the cost.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.526
Leaf it to me.

04:24.373 --> 04:28.001
<i>Founded by the original Time Strider,</i>

04:28.085 --> 04:33.966
<i>the Galactic Patrol has been responsible
for keeping all 5,600 dimensions at peace</i>

04:34.049 --> 04:36.093
<i>for over 30,000 Earth years.</i>

04:36.176 --> 04:39.221
Gee P'Gee,
so, who exactly is this Time Strider guy?

04:40.097 --> 04:44.434
<i>The Time Strider is also
known as Ah-rit Alber Ite.</i>

04:44.518 --> 04:46.395
Ah-rit Alber Ite?

04:46.478 --> 04:49.982
My dad Art Allbright.
It's his original name, I guess.

04:50.065 --> 04:51.066
His alien name?

04:51.149 --> 04:52.776
Daddy is not an alien.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.903
Eric, Earthlings can't join
the Galactic Patrol,

04:54.987 --> 04:58.615
but Uncle Art is an officer,
so, obviously, he has to be one of them.

05:01.243 --> 05:03.412
Gee P'Gee, is Daddy an alien?

05:03.495 --> 05:07.457
<i>All Galactic Patrollers are aliens
to each other, a fact which unites them,</i>

05:07.541 --> 05:11.420
<i>because each being different
means all beings are the same.</i>

05:11.503 --> 05:12.504
It didn't say no.

05:12.588 --> 05:13.714
It didn't say yes.

05:13.797 --> 05:16.842
Doesn't matter. What's important
is finding out where our father is.

05:16.925 --> 05:20.012
Rod, the aliens told us.
He's on a classified mission.

05:20.095 --> 05:21.388
That was two years ago.

05:21.471 --> 05:23.432
If he was okay,
he would've let us know by now.

05:23.515 --> 05:28.228
Something's gone wrong,
so wherever he is, he needs help.

05:29.187 --> 05:30.188
He needs me.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.940
Then ask the question.

05:32.024 --> 05:34.026
Gee P'Gee, where's Art Allbright?

05:34.443 --> 05:36.153
I've tried that one a million times.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.446
<i>Right here.</i>

05:38.113 --> 05:40.824
See, you need to come up
with a really specific question.

05:42.659 --> 05:43.869
Is that something alien?

05:46.872 --> 05:48.665
Nah. It's just Mickey.

05:59.009 --> 06:00.093
Rod, come on.

06:00.177 --> 06:03.263
My Expellerator's not exploding anymore.
You gotta try it.

06:03.347 --> 06:04.765
Five minutes, Mickey!

06:04.848 --> 06:06.558
All right. See you out there.

06:08.352 --> 06:09.686
He's so weird.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.647
Are we even gonna tell him
about the aliens?

06:11.730 --> 06:13.357
He couldn't handle it.
Specifically, he'd...

06:13.440 --> 06:14.441
He'd what?

06:15.150 --> 06:16.276
I know what to ask.

06:16.818 --> 06:19.363
Gee P'Gee, what specifically can I do
to find my father?

06:20.155 --> 06:21.573
<i>Open the front door.</i>

06:24.535 --> 06:26.036
- Hide this, quick.
- Go.

06:31.708 --> 06:32.709
Oh!

07:16.044 --> 07:17.045
Mickey?

07:20.424 --> 07:22.092
What the <i>Ferkel?</i>

07:44.990 --> 07:47.284
Rod, why is the front door open?

07:48.285 --> 07:49.286
Elspeth?

07:52.623 --> 07:54.249
Hey, you two.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.501
Did Rod and Elspeth
already go to Seldom Seen?

07:56.585 --> 07:59.880
- They...
- Didn't say.

08:00.422 --> 08:02.007
But they could have.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.719
Hmm. Okay.

08:20.275 --> 08:23.070
Mickey. Deep breath, Mickey. You're okay.

08:23.153 --> 08:24.530
Where are we?

08:24.613 --> 08:26.698
Onboard the <i>Starship Ferkel.</i>

08:27.616 --> 08:30.160
They're alien...

08:30.244 --> 08:31.828
Aliens, that's right.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.747
- The ones we told you about.
- Sort of.

08:33.829 --> 08:35.082
Two years ago. Remember?

08:36.458 --> 08:39.962
That wasn't a joke?
The Galactic Police?

08:40.879 --> 08:42.172
Captain Cracker?

08:42.256 --> 08:43.882
Uh, it's Grakker. Say it with me.

08:43.966 --> 08:45.050
Ping Pong?

08:45.968 --> 08:48.595
Tar Paper with the... With the...

08:49.513 --> 08:50.514
Oh!

08:51.890 --> 08:54.810
No. This is... This is Eye Six.

08:54.893 --> 08:56.853
No. The plant... The plant... No.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.897
You got one right, smarty plants.

08:59.314 --> 09:00.315
Plink!

09:00.649 --> 09:02.025
Told you he couldn't handle it.

09:02.484 --> 09:05.320
This... What's this?

09:05.404 --> 09:07.406
It's okay. You can say it.

09:08.365 --> 09:09.700
This is so cool!

09:13.370 --> 09:14.371
Okay.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.331
He's handling it, in a weird way.

09:34.683 --> 09:38.312
A thing of beauty is a joy forever,
wouldn't you agree?

09:38.395 --> 09:39.605
Uh...

09:40.272 --> 09:41.273
Should I?

09:41.356 --> 09:44.234
What part of "I'm gonna trap
the entire Allbright family

09:44.318 --> 09:49.364
"in a moment of sheer terror forever"
do you not understand?

09:49.448 --> 09:53.243
Uh, I don't know, uh, all of it?

09:53.327 --> 09:55.412
Lackey...

09:56.330 --> 09:57.873
<i>I need to get my revenge...</i>

09:57.956 --> 09:59.166
No. No.

09:59.249 --> 10:00.459
<i>...on Rod Allbright.</i>

10:01.627 --> 10:04.588
But, so... What's wrong, sir?

10:05.839 --> 10:07.758
I'll tell you what's wrong.

10:08.592 --> 10:11.762
I still don't know exactly where
to place my Time Trap.

10:11.845 --> 10:16.350
And the one person that does know
is Rod's dad, and he is still missing.

10:25.234 --> 10:28.570
Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir.

10:28.654 --> 10:31.156
So delicious.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.574
I forgot, you like that.

10:32.658 --> 10:33.659
Get out of my face.

10:33.742 --> 10:35.285
Go lick down the anti-matter vats
or something.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.704
Right away, sir. At once, sir.

10:37.788 --> 10:40.916
My tongue is already tingling.

10:42.668 --> 10:46.505
Ah, look at this. Lookie-loo.

11:01.144 --> 11:03.730
Eric, give it.
I have a way better question.

11:04.690 --> 11:06.608
Gee P'Gee? Gee P'Gee, are you there?

11:06.692 --> 11:09.528
It's Linda, Rod's sister.

11:10.863 --> 11:13.532
Gee P'Gee, why are bananas yellow?

11:15.284 --> 11:18.912
Gee P'Gee,
is the <i>Ferkel</i> in our house right now?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.915
Ask about it again.

11:22.624 --> 11:28.255
Gee P'Gee, where is the <i>Ferkel</i> right now?

11:29.548 --> 11:31.633
<i>The</i> Ferkel <i>has left Dimension Q</i>

11:31.717 --> 11:34.344
<i>and now travels
in multi-dimensional space.</i>

11:34.428 --> 11:36.054
Linda? Eric?

11:36.138 --> 11:37.723
What have you got under there?

11:40.183 --> 11:41.393
What? You were supposed to hide it.

11:43.729 --> 11:46.231
Nothing.

11:47.608 --> 11:49.026
Mmm-hmm?

11:52.821 --> 11:54.239
Well, you know,

11:54.323 --> 11:57.618
you shouldn't take Rod's things
without asking his permission.

11:57.701 --> 11:58.827
What thing?

12:03.415 --> 12:06.043
Hmm. What is this? A toy?

12:06.627 --> 12:08.837
- No...
- It's a Gee P'Gee.

12:09.504 --> 12:11.131
A Gee P'Gee?

12:11.965 --> 12:13.675
Where did Rod get this?

12:13.759 --> 12:16.178
<i>This Galactic Patrol Guidebook, Mark Five,</i>

12:16.261 --> 12:19.389
- <i>was teleported to Deputy Rod Allbright...</i>
- Oh, no. What do we do?

12:19.473 --> 12:22.392
<i>...eight Earth months ago
on the occasion of his 13th birthday</i>

12:22.476 --> 12:26.230
<i>as a gift from the grateful crew
of the</i> Starship Ferkel.

12:26.563 --> 12:27.564
<i>Ferkel?</i> What...

12:28.690 --> 12:30.275
What are those things?

12:31.109 --> 12:32.945
Why are Rod and Elspeth with them?

12:33.028 --> 12:34.530
What is this?

12:34.947 --> 12:38.450
You have to say "Gee P'Gee" first, Mom,
then ask a question.

12:38.534 --> 12:39.785
It kind of knows everything.

12:39.868 --> 12:42.704
Roddie thinks it could even tell us
where Daddy is.

12:43.872 --> 12:46.458
Only if we know
how to ask the right question.

12:46.542 --> 12:49.002
Mmm-hmm. I really miss Daddy.

12:49.086 --> 12:50.087
Me too.

12:58.428 --> 12:59.429
Very good.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.349
Huh.

13:05.435 --> 13:07.020
Oh.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.356
What's its purpose?

13:09.439 --> 13:11.650
It doesn't need one. It's delicious.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.068
Oh. Hey, look.

13:14.319 --> 13:15.863
Now look at this, huh?

13:17.114 --> 13:18.490
Yeah. That's impressive.

13:18.907 --> 13:19.908
Yeah.

13:20.492 --> 13:21.493
Wow!

13:22.828 --> 13:24.913
- Oh, my. What just happened?
- Uh...

13:25.998 --> 13:27.916
- I am in need of assistance.
- Dear Tar.

13:28.542 --> 13:31.879
Does your device come with
what you would call an instruction manual?

13:31.962 --> 13:33.672
...confabulation on your eyes.

13:34.256 --> 13:36.341
- Thank you, Madame Pong.
- Oh, my dear Tar.

13:36.425 --> 13:38.552
It's for my patent application.

13:38.635 --> 13:39.636
Oh.

13:40.512 --> 13:42.222
Yeah. Very thorough.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.603
It's also delicious.

13:49.605 --> 13:50.606
Aliens.

13:50.689 --> 13:52.190
Uh, sorry.

13:55.652 --> 13:57.988
Subject is secure.

13:58.864 --> 14:00.616
Wait. "Subject"?

14:00.699 --> 14:03.493
Perhaps not the best choice of words.

14:03.577 --> 14:06.872
"Experimental test subject"
would be more accurate.

14:06.955 --> 14:09.374
This has never been tried
on an Earthling before.

14:09.458 --> 14:12.377
Uh, it's been tried.
It just hasn't worked.

14:13.253 --> 14:16.465
Are any of you ever going to tell me
what's really going on around here?

14:16.548 --> 14:17.591
Uh, nope. Classified.

14:17.674 --> 14:19.343
Not the best idea.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.802
Highly doubtful. Too dangerous.

14:20.886 --> 14:23.805
Have you ever thought that
if you did tell me, maybe I could help?

14:23.889 --> 14:24.932
And so could we.

14:25.015 --> 14:26.016
Yeah.

14:26.308 --> 14:27.309
We can?

14:27.392 --> 14:29.895
Young Rod, all you need to know

14:29.978 --> 14:32.940
is that we are helping
you contact your father.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.527
By strengthening the psychic link
that connects the two of you.

14:36.610 --> 14:37.611
Psychic link?

14:37.694 --> 14:40.447
Yes. It is a way to
exchange information between minds

14:40.531 --> 14:41.949
simply with a touch.

14:42.032 --> 14:45.077
Elspeth, that's how the Tar
taught you and I to use our flying belts.

14:45.911 --> 14:46.912
Hey.

14:47.204 --> 14:48.205
Ow!

14:51.333 --> 14:52.960
Flying belts?

14:53.043 --> 14:54.211
Awesome!

14:54.962 --> 14:57.881
Wait. My dad did that, too,
the night he left us.

14:58.590 --> 14:59.591
Ow!

15:00.509 --> 15:03.804
Did your dad actually transfer knowledge
from his mind to yours?

15:04.638 --> 15:06.932
I think so, but I don't know what.

15:07.432 --> 15:09.768
In a moment, we all will know.

15:10.185 --> 15:11.186
Is this gonna hurt?

15:11.270 --> 15:12.729
Uh, not me.

15:14.856 --> 15:16.358
Are you ready, young deputy?

15:16.441 --> 15:17.442
Not really.

15:17.526 --> 15:18.944
Hmm. Excellent.

15:19.027 --> 15:20.612
How is that excellent?

15:20.696 --> 15:23.866
From my talon to your nose.

15:23.949 --> 15:25.075
Wait. Why my...

15:27.202 --> 15:28.203
<i>Tatmen...</i>

15:29.037 --> 15:30.038
<i>Tatmen.</i>

15:30.789 --> 15:31.790
Mentat.

15:35.544 --> 15:36.545
Young deputy?

15:37.462 --> 15:39.965
Uh-oh. I think we broke him.

15:41.133 --> 15:42.676
Clear!

15:42.759 --> 15:44.761
- No.
- Does that work on humans?

15:44.845 --> 15:46.013
Oh, you're right.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.766
Young deputy? Young deputy?

15:50.058 --> 15:53.353
Perhaps you shouldn't have energized
his underdeveloped human brain

15:53.437 --> 15:55.480
through his scent-sniffing face holes.

15:55.564 --> 15:58.150
Ah, yes. Well, live and learn.

15:58.233 --> 15:59.902
What have you done?

16:00.694 --> 16:01.695
Did it work?

16:01.778 --> 16:04.531
Uh, unless we permanently fried his...

16:05.574 --> 16:08.035
Classified.

16:08.118 --> 16:11.079
I saw my dad.
I know it was him.

16:12.122 --> 16:13.415
Did you get his location?

16:13.498 --> 16:15.542
Yes, but it wasn't a good place.

16:15.626 --> 16:16.919
I think he was trying to warn me.

16:17.336 --> 16:19.421
Focus your thoughts, young deputy,
as the...

16:19.504 --> 16:23.258
As the lens of Mickey focuses photons
from your external form.

16:23.342 --> 16:24.635
That almost made sense.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.929
What was the nature
of your father's warning?

16:27.387 --> 16:28.388
Dad was saying something.

16:29.014 --> 16:30.265
Two words over and over.

16:30.349 --> 16:32.517
Tat. Men. Tatmen...

16:32.601 --> 16:35.854
The planet Mentat.

16:35.938 --> 16:38.815
<i>Attention, all carbon-based bipeds,
and Tar Gibbons.</i>

16:38.899 --> 16:40.150
<i>Report to the flight deck.</i>

16:40.567 --> 16:42.402
- <i>Something new has cropped up.</i>
- Oh, boy.

16:42.486 --> 16:45.531
Galactic Patrol Headquarters
has ordered us to go to Plant...

16:45.614 --> 16:47.699
Make that "Planet Zambreno."

16:48.700 --> 16:50.744
What? Why?

16:50.827 --> 16:53.080
Their intelligence says
it'll lead us to B'kr.

16:54.122 --> 16:57.042
B'kr has threatened
to destroy the galaxy.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.877
- What?
- The whole galaxy?

16:58.961 --> 17:00.170
- Is that even possible?
- Yes.

17:00.254 --> 17:01.338
We think so.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.215
I mean, we think so.

17:04.258 --> 17:06.969
That's why we can't wait any longer
for Rod's father to contact us.

17:07.052 --> 17:08.804
We have to find him at once.

17:08.887 --> 17:10.764
Only he can stop B'kr's evil plan.

17:10.846 --> 17:12.932
If finding my dad is what can stop B'kr,

17:13.016 --> 17:14.642
then we have to go to the Mentat planet.

17:14.726 --> 17:17.312
Except, as Galactic Patrol Officers,

17:17.396 --> 17:19.690
we must follow official orders.

17:19.773 --> 17:21.691
We must go to Zambreno.

17:21.775 --> 17:25.737
If we refuse to follow proper orders,
we will be charged as renegades.

17:25.821 --> 17:27.155
Then your orders aren't proper

17:27.239 --> 17:29.741
because it's so obvious
that there's only one thing to do.

17:29.825 --> 17:31.326
What is that, young deputy?

17:31.743 --> 17:35.080
What the Galactic Patrol
is always supposed to do. The right thing.

17:35.831 --> 17:36.874
But that would...

17:36.957 --> 17:38.417
Make each and every one of us...

17:38.500 --> 17:40.377
- Plink.
- What she said.

17:41.044 --> 17:43.589
Renegades against the Patrol.

17:43.672 --> 17:45.966
Renegades who can save my dad.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.467
Uh...

17:52.180 --> 17:53.181
And the galaxy.

17:53.265 --> 17:55.142
- Ah!
- Yeah.

17:55.225 --> 17:56.226
Okay. Yeah.

17:56.310 --> 17:57.686
Phil, plot a course.

17:57.769 --> 17:59.521
New course already set.

17:59.605 --> 18:01.773
Full seed... Speed ahead to the Mentat.

18:12.284 --> 18:14.161
<i>And those are the officers</i>

18:14.244 --> 18:16.914
<i>that make up the crew of
the</i> Starship Ferkel.

18:17.789 --> 18:21.960
And that's Daddy, but I do not know
why he's dressed like an alien.

18:22.044 --> 18:23.045
Mmm-mmm.

18:24.630 --> 18:25.881
Um...

18:25.964 --> 18:27.216
All right.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.929
Well, let's ask.

18:36.141 --> 18:37.517
Gee P'Gee,

18:38.602 --> 18:41.688
why is my Art dressed
in an alien uniform?

18:42.397 --> 18:44.483
<i>As founder of the Galactic Patrol,</i>

18:44.566 --> 18:48.737
<i>Commander Art Allbright
is an honored officer, and true hero.</i>

18:50.531 --> 18:52.491
Wow! Daddy's a hero!

18:52.574 --> 18:55.410
I bet he'll have a lot of great stories
to tell us when we see him.

18:55.494 --> 18:56.954
When you see him?

18:57.037 --> 18:58.038
When he comes back.

18:58.121 --> 18:59.998
Because he promised Roddie he would.

19:00.082 --> 19:01.750
Don't you remember?

19:04.336 --> 19:05.420
Every day.

19:08.423 --> 19:10.175
Oh. Oh.

19:12.594 --> 19:13.595
Lackey!

19:13.679 --> 19:14.846
I didn't do it!

19:15.180 --> 19:17.849
I mean, yes, Leader Zupreme?

19:17.933 --> 19:19.685
Get me my number-three sharpener.

19:20.018 --> 19:21.853
Uh, right away, sir.

19:33.532 --> 19:39.079
Something has molted its skin.

19:40.247 --> 19:44.209
That's just my human
grubling mask, you wormhole,

19:44.293 --> 19:46.545
from when I passed myself off
as Billy Becker

19:46.628 --> 19:48.547
to go to Rod Allbright's pathetic school.

19:52.718 --> 19:53.927
No. No. Please, no. No, sir.

19:54.011 --> 19:56.054
Hello, Lackey. I'm your new best friend.

19:56.138 --> 19:57.598
I don't like it. It's scary.

19:57.681 --> 19:58.724
It's pathetically ugly.

19:59.224 --> 20:02.269
I know. Ah, it made my spikes itch like...

20:04.146 --> 20:05.772
Take this.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.989
What?

20:14.406 --> 20:15.782
Why change course to...

20:16.909 --> 20:18.035
Unless...

20:18.577 --> 20:19.661
It has to be.

20:21.163 --> 20:22.247
Allbright.

20:22.331 --> 20:25.792
They'll lead me to him, and I'll get
that final piece of information

20:25.876 --> 20:28.462
of where exactly to place my Time Trap.

20:28.921 --> 20:30.172
Yes!

20:30.839 --> 20:32.799
Grab the throttle, Lackey.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.051
Yeah. Aye, aye.

20:34.593 --> 20:37.012
Full speed ahead, baby!

20:37.095 --> 20:38.138
Yeah!

20:38.222 --> 20:39.681
Let's go, Lackey!

20:39.765 --> 20:43.101
Allbright, we're coming for you.

21:01.662 --> 21:03.455
That's a whole new alien planet.

21:03.539 --> 21:05.624
But it's not a place.

21:08.210 --> 21:09.711
It's a plant?

21:09.795 --> 21:12.881
The Mentat is the oldest living organism
in the galaxy.

21:13.215 --> 21:14.424
Whoa!

21:14.841 --> 21:18.178
I'm proud to say I have an uncle
who claims our family trees are related.

21:43.495 --> 21:44.496
Oh, boy.

21:44.580 --> 21:45.747
Mmm-hmm.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.710
Here we go.

21:55.007 --> 21:56.008
Oh, yeah.

21:56.592 --> 21:57.593
Captain Grakker?

21:57.676 --> 21:59.761
You want a piece of me? You wouldn't know
what to do with an angry Blue.

21:59.845 --> 22:00.971
Let's dance!

22:01.054 --> 22:04.600
Uh, perhaps something
a little less in-your-face?

22:04.683 --> 22:06.393
Huh? You eyeballing me, weirdo?

22:06.476 --> 22:07.936
Remember to keep it controlled.

22:10.355 --> 22:11.356
What are they doing?

22:11.857 --> 22:13.525
Changing his behavior module.

22:22.159 --> 22:23.702
Yeah.

22:23.785 --> 22:24.786
Oh.

22:26.663 --> 22:28.040
Captain Grakker?

22:29.374 --> 22:33.003
Why, hello there, princess. How you doin'?

22:33.545 --> 22:34.755
Not so well.

22:34.838 --> 22:36.131
Oh, shucks.

22:36.215 --> 22:39.259
Since we do not know
what to expect in the Mentat,

22:39.343 --> 22:42.930
perhaps the best module
to choose is that which is unexpected.

22:43.722 --> 22:44.890
Ah!

22:44.973 --> 22:47.893
The remote-control module.

22:49.686 --> 22:52.564
I am, uh, A-okay with that there, missy.

22:54.483 --> 22:56.026
- Oh, yeah, right. Yep.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.110
Okay.

23:10.749 --> 23:13.335
Eenie, meenie, miney, and...

23:13.794 --> 23:14.795
No.

23:18.257 --> 23:21.051
All uninvited entities must halt.

23:21.134 --> 23:24.096
State your business.

23:24.179 --> 23:26.014
I am Captain Grakker
of the Galactic Patrol,

23:26.598 --> 23:28.517
and I state that you state your authority

23:28.600 --> 23:32.521
to ask me to state my business
before you state yours.

23:32.604 --> 23:34.064
A touch too by-the-book.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.150
<i>Aah...</i>

23:37.234 --> 23:40.320
I'm Arly Bung, Chief of Security.

23:40.404 --> 23:42.614
Is this your vessel?

23:44.825 --> 23:45.951
Why?

23:46.159 --> 23:47.160
What?

23:47.244 --> 23:48.745
Ha!

23:49.746 --> 23:51.123
Oh.

23:51.874 --> 23:53.166
Yeah. You got that right, buddy.

23:54.126 --> 23:56.253
The good old <i>Starship Ferkel.</i> Yeah!

23:57.045 --> 24:00.841
Well, then raise
your manipulatory appendages.

24:01.550 --> 24:05.554
There's an all-quadrant alert
about you <i>Ferkel</i> renegades.

24:06.430 --> 24:11.101
I'm locking you up till patrol can
ship you to the Alcatron Prison planet.

24:12.019 --> 24:15.731
How many more renegades
are on board?

24:15.814 --> 24:18.358
Yeah, that is a good question.

24:18.984 --> 24:20.319
Not bad for a fish.

24:20.402 --> 24:22.988
Pompous, foolhardy...

24:23.530 --> 24:26.241
Ah! Cleverly straightforward.

24:29.161 --> 24:31.163
Spit it out, Captain!

24:34.958 --> 24:37.211
There are no renegades,
that is Galactic Patrol,

24:37.294 --> 24:41.715
defying proper orders
currently on the <i>Ferkel.</i>

24:42.424 --> 24:45.761
Good boy, Captain. Now move.

24:46.595 --> 24:48.013
So, this way?

24:48.096 --> 24:49.264
- Yes.
- Yeah?

24:49.348 --> 24:50.390
Excuse me, fellas.

24:50.933 --> 24:52.434
Yeah, move out of the way, bud.

24:54.102 --> 24:55.812
<i>You should probably think about pruning.</i>

24:56.271 --> 24:59.942
Well, that branched off
a bit from the truth, but not a lot.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.693
Phil, activate the teleporter.

25:01.777 --> 25:02.778
We have to rescue him.

25:02.861 --> 25:03.862
Good to go.

25:03.946 --> 25:04.947
No. We can't.

25:05.572 --> 25:06.615
What?

25:07.032 --> 25:09.576
If we go after them,
Arly Bung will lock us up too.

25:09.660 --> 25:12.579
We need a plan to rescue our friend
and still be free to find my dad.

25:12.663 --> 25:14.164
The young deputy is correct.

25:14.623 --> 25:15.999
First thing, we'll need a map.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.751
Phil, can you access one?

25:17.834 --> 25:19.962
Does the sap rise in the spring?

25:24.299 --> 25:25.801
How does anyone get around in there?

25:25.884 --> 25:29.555
It's a snap pea.
The Mentat has its own teleporter network.

25:30.347 --> 25:33.183
Can you hook up the <i>Ferkel's</i> teleporter
to the Mentat's network?

25:33.267 --> 25:35.060
Then we could teleport anywhere inside it.

25:35.143 --> 25:37.854
Anywhere that doesn't have
teleportation blockage beams.

25:38.438 --> 25:40.065
My dad's in there, somewhere.

25:40.524 --> 25:43.026
Wherever he is,
that's where we need to go.

25:43.110 --> 25:44.862
We cannot go.

25:44.945 --> 25:46.196
Madame Pong is correct.

25:46.697 --> 25:50.284
If she and I accompany you,
Mentat Sensors will alert Chief Bung

25:50.367 --> 25:52.703
to the presence of
additional <i>Ferkel</i> renegades.

25:53.161 --> 25:56.623
However, the Mentat Sensors
are not set for humans.

25:56.707 --> 25:58.000
We understand.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.084
We can do this, Phil.

26:00.085 --> 26:01.086
Got it.

26:01.169 --> 26:06.133
But I'm gonna need more technical
science-y things like, uh, co-ordinates.

26:06.550 --> 26:10.804
Young deputy,
ask yourself, what would I do?

26:10.888 --> 26:13.348
You'd probably say something
I wouldn't understand.

26:13.432 --> 26:15.309
But half of the time...

26:15.767 --> 26:17.477
You'd say something like...

26:17.978 --> 26:18.979
Like?

26:19.062 --> 26:20.314
Like...

26:20.689 --> 26:23.191
"To find that which is missing,
young deputy,

26:23.275 --> 26:25.402
"you must first lose yourself."

26:34.620 --> 26:35.621
What?

26:36.747 --> 26:37.748
<i>Tat men. Tat men.</i>

26:38.332 --> 26:39.374
Mentat.

26:40.792 --> 26:42.836
Spa font!

26:42.920 --> 26:44.671
Phil, I know the co-ordinates.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.256
Plink!

26:54.723 --> 26:55.807
Whoa!

26:56.433 --> 26:58.143
That'd make such a great ride.

26:58.727 --> 26:59.728
No way.

27:02.022 --> 27:03.482
Is this the right place?

27:04.191 --> 27:05.442
I think so.

27:06.568 --> 27:07.736
I think...

27:10.489 --> 27:13.784
I think I can see better
with my eyes closed.

27:15.327 --> 27:17.162
He's starting to sound like Tar Gibbons.

27:18.038 --> 27:20.749
Keep going straight, Rod.
We'll keep you from bumping into things.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.543
Something doesn't feel right.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.379
You mean about Rod's dad
being here?

27:25.462 --> 27:26.713
I mean, Rod's right.

27:26.797 --> 27:28.465
How could Uncle Art be here for years

27:28.549 --> 27:30.425
without letting his family know
he's all right?

27:31.093 --> 27:33.303
Which means he could be here...

27:33.929 --> 27:35.722
but not all right, right?

27:35.806 --> 27:37.558
- Right?
- No. To the left.

27:38.517 --> 27:40.561
It's around here somewhere.
I can feel it.

27:45.148 --> 27:46.275
Rod, look out!

27:46.358 --> 27:47.359
Rod!

27:50.362 --> 27:51.363
Come on.

27:53.365 --> 27:55.325
Run! Run!

27:56.910 --> 27:57.911
What is that?

27:57.995 --> 27:59.580
I don't know. Just keep going.

27:59.663 --> 28:00.956
Go.

28:15.470 --> 28:16.638
Run! Go!

28:18.390 --> 28:20.100
- This way!
- Go, go.

28:23.228 --> 28:24.438
Rod, look out!

28:28.483 --> 28:29.860
What the heck was that?

28:29.943 --> 28:32.738
Root ball, obviously. It must be how
the Mentat plant sends messages

28:32.821 --> 28:34.072
through its whole root system.

28:34.156 --> 28:35.824
It's gonna take a while
to unravel this mess.

28:35.908 --> 28:38.327
We don't have a while. I've got to...

28:39.369 --> 28:40.495
Get me out of here!

28:40.579 --> 28:42.039
There's no time.

28:42.122 --> 28:43.999
- Climb, Rod. Climb!
- Go!

28:53.926 --> 28:55.177
- Rod...
- Rod!

29:00.682 --> 29:01.767
He's gone.

29:45.894 --> 29:46.895
Dad.

29:50.983 --> 29:54.319
Okay, here goes nothing.

29:57.114 --> 29:59.157
Surprisingly sturdy for shrubbery.

30:00.659 --> 30:01.660
Ah.

30:07.624 --> 30:09.501
Whoa!

30:10.085 --> 30:11.169
Wow!

30:12.588 --> 30:13.964
Well played, Bung.

30:14.047 --> 30:17.634
However, may I say
you are not acting in accordance

30:17.718 --> 30:22.764
with Galactic ordinance 51.6475.2b.

30:23.599 --> 30:25.559
You must free me at once.

30:25.642 --> 30:26.852
Silence, Friskian.

30:27.477 --> 30:28.854
I know that,

30:28.937 --> 30:32.232
but I am acting in full accordance

30:32.316 --> 30:38.447
with Galactic Ordinance 432.75.8969.

30:38.864 --> 30:39.865
Aha!

30:40.199 --> 30:43.744
But in doing so,
you are violating Galactic Ordinance 14.

30:43.827 --> 30:45.829
Oh, yeah.

30:45.913 --> 30:48.415
But that only applies in Dimension X,

30:49.374 --> 30:52.169
and we are in Dimension Q.

30:52.252 --> 30:54.546
Argh! Boogers, boogers, boogers!

30:54.630 --> 30:57.507
There's no way out for you.

31:01.595 --> 31:03.222
Yes, there is.

31:03.805 --> 31:04.806
Who said that?

31:04.890 --> 31:06.183
Said what?

31:06.600 --> 31:07.935
That... That there's a way out.

31:08.018 --> 31:09.519
There is?

31:09.937 --> 31:11.396
Someone just said so.

31:11.480 --> 31:14.107
Then it must have been us.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.610
Okay, enough.

31:17.361 --> 31:18.570
Show yourselves.

31:18.654 --> 31:23.242
Pay attention,
because we're all around you.

31:32.751 --> 31:33.752
Dad.

31:38.340 --> 31:40.509
What are you... What are you doing?

31:43.428 --> 31:46.557
You're trying to reach this control thing?

32:25.888 --> 32:26.889
Rod?

32:27.514 --> 32:28.515
Dad.

32:28.599 --> 32:31.435
You've grown. You're... You're older.

32:35.147 --> 32:38.483
I've been trapped in a moment of time.

32:38.901 --> 32:40.736
- How long?
- Five years.

32:41.236 --> 32:43.614
It's okay, Dad. I found you now.

32:43.697 --> 32:44.698
Yeah.

32:45.407 --> 32:46.909
You did. You did.

32:49.995 --> 32:51.622
Oh.

32:52.331 --> 32:53.332
You're Mentat tree roots.

32:53.415 --> 32:55.959
We are?
We mean, yes, we are.

32:56.043 --> 32:58.086
Cousin Phil reached out to us.

32:58.170 --> 33:01.215
Phillogenous esk Piemondum?
Uh, you know, Phil?

33:01.840 --> 33:03.217
You guys are related to him?

33:03.300 --> 33:07.346
He said we plants have to stick together,
even if you think that's sappy.

33:08.430 --> 33:09.806
You are definitely related.

33:10.599 --> 33:13.352
But how are you gonna help me escape?

33:13.769 --> 33:17.564
You'll have to uproot yourself,
Graktain Capper,

33:17.648 --> 33:21.109
but we'll make it easy-peasy.

33:22.069 --> 33:23.111
Ooh!

33:27.699 --> 33:30.494
Open sesame seed!

33:50.138 --> 33:51.598
Uh, hey. You, uh...

33:52.057 --> 33:54.726
You got a license for that? No?
You know, I'm just gonna...

33:56.228 --> 33:57.563
Whoa!

34:00.607 --> 34:02.192
You guys related, or...

34:02.860 --> 34:04.069
Ah, boogers!

34:07.656 --> 34:09.700
Ah, welcome back, Captain.

34:10.367 --> 34:12.244
Phil, where are the Earthlings?

34:12.327 --> 34:14.788
Beets me.
And the Roots are all tapped out.

34:14.872 --> 34:17.456
I was scanning the grublings
deep in the lower tunnels

34:17.541 --> 34:19.001
and then they plum vanished.

34:19.084 --> 34:22.212
There must be an energy field
down there blocking our scanners.

34:22.296 --> 34:24.423
And putting a real strain
on the teleporter.

34:24.506 --> 34:26.465
There's nothing we can do to find them.

34:26.550 --> 34:28.302
We've come to the end.

34:29.177 --> 34:31.722
So we must start
at the beginning.

34:32.847 --> 34:34.182
Of course.

34:41.481 --> 34:42.481
Uncle Art?

34:43.317 --> 34:45.360
Elspeth? Mickey?

34:45.943 --> 34:47.279
Look at you!

34:47.362 --> 34:48.905
We were all so worried about you.

34:48.989 --> 34:51.116
Well, I thought I'd be gone
for a week or two,

34:51.200 --> 34:54.161
a month, at most,
but at least you guys are all together.

34:56.288 --> 34:57.372
Mom. The twins.

34:57.456 --> 34:58.582
They're okay, Dad.

34:59.458 --> 35:00.459
Good.

35:00.542 --> 35:01.835
Oh! Oh, Mickey!

35:01.919 --> 35:03.545
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

35:03.629 --> 35:05.672
Careful. Slowly. Slowly.

35:06.381 --> 35:08.592
Thank you.

35:08.842 --> 35:12.429
This needs to be kept
in radiation shielding.

35:14.556 --> 35:17.059
In case it switches on again.

35:18.018 --> 35:19.102
What is it, anyway?

35:19.603 --> 35:20.687
What started this whole mess...

35:21.271 --> 35:23.815
A Micro Time Trap booby-trapped by B'kr.

35:23.899 --> 35:24.983
B'kr?

35:26.235 --> 35:27.361
Mentat security alert.

35:27.444 --> 35:29.738
It might be for us.
Patrol thinks we're renegades.

35:30.197 --> 35:31.323
Well, we've gotta move fast.

35:32.032 --> 35:36.036
We can't let any of this
get in the wrong manipulatory appendages.

35:36.119 --> 35:37.162
"Appendages"?

35:37.246 --> 35:38.247
Alien.

35:44.503 --> 35:47.172
Where are you, Grakker?

35:53.095 --> 35:54.680
Okay. Here we are.

35:57.808 --> 35:59.476
Why did B'kr booby-trap that thing?

36:00.686 --> 36:02.104
Because I'm his worst enemy.

36:02.187 --> 36:03.480
Isn't everybody?

36:04.982 --> 36:06.275
We used to be best friends.

36:06.358 --> 36:07.359
No way.

36:07.442 --> 36:08.485
We worked together for years

36:09.111 --> 36:11.864
to build
the Chrono-negatronic Retrolocitor.

36:12.447 --> 36:13.699
Is that like, a time machine?

36:13.782 --> 36:14.950
Ultimately, yes.

36:15.033 --> 36:16.034
Why?

36:16.118 --> 36:19.079
Because I wanted to get back
to the place I was born.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.874
Oh, kids, uh, grab the backpacks.

36:21.957 --> 36:24.042
They're, uh, underneath the beakers.

36:24.585 --> 36:25.878
On which planet?

36:26.295 --> 36:28.046
Same as all of you. Earth.

36:28.881 --> 36:31.049
Hold it. You're not an alien.

36:31.592 --> 36:33.886
What? Of course not.

36:34.261 --> 36:35.470
Oh, yes.

36:35.554 --> 36:37.514
Then where were you born, exactly?

36:37.598 --> 36:38.807
Atlantis.

36:39.725 --> 36:41.727
Atlantis, Georgia?

36:42.227 --> 36:43.228
Seriously?

36:44.187 --> 36:45.188
Wait.

36:45.272 --> 36:46.940
Atlantis, the lost continent?

36:47.399 --> 36:50.068
Yes. Home of Earth's first civilization.

36:51.778 --> 36:55.449
Where I was born 35,000 years ago.

37:07.085 --> 37:08.587
Ha! Found it.

37:09.046 --> 37:11.715
I found the energy block.

37:11.798 --> 37:14.676
There's no way to know
what's concealed behind it.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.846
Captain, unidentified running objects
closing in.

37:17.930 --> 37:19.348
Could be hostile beans.

37:20.098 --> 37:21.099
Acknowledged.

37:29.608 --> 37:33.862
Uncle Art, you look pretty good
for someone who's 35,000 years old.

37:33.946 --> 37:36.240
That's just when I was born.

37:36.865 --> 37:40.577
Actually, I spent so much time travelling
through space in hibernation pods,

37:41.119 --> 37:43.038
I'm only a couple of years older
than your Aunt Gwen.

37:44.831 --> 37:46.542
Why go back in time to Atlantis?

37:47.167 --> 37:48.168
Because I wanted to go home.

37:49.545 --> 37:53.048
See, for me,
my first space voyage only lasted a year,

37:53.131 --> 37:55.175
but back on Earth,
1,000 years had passed.

37:55.968 --> 37:57.302
Atlantis was long gone.

37:57.803 --> 37:58.804
Wow.

37:58.887 --> 38:01.181
Is that why you ended up
working with B'kr?

38:01.974 --> 38:06.645
Well, he said that
he could help me build my machine,

38:06.728 --> 38:09.731
that together,
we could be travelers through time.

38:10.357 --> 38:11.400
But he lied.

38:11.483 --> 38:12.860
That's all B'kr does.

38:13.485 --> 38:15.821
Not entirely true, Pudge-Boy.

38:17.948 --> 38:18.949
Who are you?

38:26.123 --> 38:27.666
Your old school friend, Roddie.

38:27.749 --> 38:29.877
Recognize the pretty face?

38:29.960 --> 38:31.169
Billy Becker?

38:32.754 --> 38:34.089
B'kr.

38:34.172 --> 38:36.758
Hello, Allbright. Been a while.

38:49.021 --> 38:50.689
Madame Pong, I saw B'kr.

38:50.772 --> 38:52.649
He's with an Insectoroid.

38:52.733 --> 38:55.235
They're in the area,
hidden by the energy block.

38:55.319 --> 38:59.031
If Rod's father is being protected
by that energy field,

38:59.114 --> 39:00.490
and B'kr has found him...

39:00.949 --> 39:02.492
Then we can no longer stay hidden.

39:02.993 --> 39:05.204
Suits me fine. I'm no shrinking violet.

39:05.287 --> 39:06.955
It's time we took some blooming action.

39:07.497 --> 39:09.082
Activate the debigginer.

39:09.625 --> 39:11.835
Okay.
Forget what I said about not shrinking.

39:17.090 --> 39:21.929
So, this is where you stashed everything
you snatched from my lab.

39:22.012 --> 39:23.013
Our lab.

39:23.472 --> 39:25.349
Right. The good old days.

39:25.432 --> 39:27.267
What are you doing here, Billy?

39:27.351 --> 39:31.188
Looking for the one last thing
your old man kept from me.

39:36.068 --> 39:37.236
That won't work here.

39:37.319 --> 39:38.862
I've set up an energy field

39:38.946 --> 39:40.322
that blocks all scanners.

39:40.405 --> 39:42.366
Regular scanners, maybe,

39:42.449 --> 39:45.661
but not my psychic scanner.

39:47.913 --> 39:49.998
So, Allbrights, who's first?

39:53.293 --> 39:54.962
Ugh! I hate messes.

39:55.754 --> 39:57.089
Messy mess.

39:58.757 --> 40:04.846
Grakker.
You can't hide from me.

40:06.098 --> 40:07.641
Psychic link.

40:08.350 --> 40:11.144
That has to be
how you found your father.

40:11.228 --> 40:14.273
Am I right, or am I right?

40:16.358 --> 40:19.152
Everyone comfy now?

40:21.989 --> 40:24.616
Love these prisoner tabs.

40:24.700 --> 40:28.495
Bet you're real happy
you invented them now, aren't ya?

40:29.454 --> 40:34.209
Did you tell Rod about one of
your other brilliant inventions?

40:34.293 --> 40:36.295
You are pathetic.

40:36.378 --> 40:38.964
Chrono-nega-blah-blah-blah.

40:39.047 --> 40:42.009
Going back to old home. Boo-hoo!

40:42.092 --> 40:44.720
It's called the
Chrono-negatronic Retrolocitor, Billy.

40:44.803 --> 40:46.513
- Chrono-negatronic...
- Get to the point.

40:47.014 --> 40:48.515
He's already seen it in action.

40:48.599 --> 40:51.101
I've been trapped here for five years!

40:51.184 --> 40:55.272
I knew it. I knew you were
up to something back then.

40:55.856 --> 40:59.193
Now, what about my Time Trap?

40:59.276 --> 41:01.320
Did you tell Rod about that one?

41:01.862 --> 41:05.824
Rod, I...
I wanted to travel through time,

41:05.908 --> 41:10.495
but B'kr wanted to trap
a single moment of it in an endless loop.

41:10.579 --> 41:15.334
Imagine a Mega Time Trap
so big and so powerful

41:15.417 --> 41:19.254
it could capture
the entire galaxy in an endless moment,

41:19.338 --> 41:21.548
just like your dad was.

41:21.632 --> 41:23.592
So pointless.

41:23.675 --> 41:26.345
Yeah. One moment repeating forever?

41:26.428 --> 41:27.679
That would suck big time.

41:27.763 --> 41:29.681
Depends on the moment.

41:30.265 --> 41:32.267
So chaotic. I hate this planet.

41:35.938 --> 41:36.939
What is...

41:42.319 --> 41:45.781
No! This is Chief Bung.
I've just seen the...

41:48.575 --> 41:51.995
Knowing precisely
where to set my Mega Time Trap

41:52.079 --> 41:54.790
was the one thing
I couldn't figure out.

41:55.290 --> 41:57.292
But your dad could,

41:57.376 --> 41:58.877
and did.

41:58.961 --> 42:00.504
Dad, don't tell him.

42:00.879 --> 42:03.173
That's the thing. He can't.

42:03.257 --> 42:06.134
He knew how important
that information was to me,

42:06.218 --> 42:08.804
and how easily I could
get him to tell me.

42:09.721 --> 42:14.476
So he blocked it out of his mind...

42:14.560 --> 42:17.688
...and placed it
someplace he thought I'd never find it.

42:18.522 --> 42:22.109
Ah. Two brains
with two different swirly bits,

42:22.192 --> 42:25.529
except for a blank bit
in your dad's brain

42:25.612 --> 42:27.281
and one new bit
of information

42:27.364 --> 42:29.950
that has been jammed into yours.

42:30.701 --> 42:33.996
You know what that means, Roddie?
No?

42:34.872 --> 42:39.126
To complete my plan,
all I need is your brain.

42:39.209 --> 42:42.296
I hope you don't mind.

42:42.963 --> 42:45.048
Struggle all you want.

42:45.132 --> 42:47.342
Your prisoner tabs are in my control.

42:56.351 --> 42:58.979
Leader Zupreme!

42:59.062 --> 43:02.941
B'kr, drop your blaster
by order of the Galactic Patrol.

43:03.025 --> 43:05.152
Blast them to quarks!

43:10.115 --> 43:11.742
Focus the destructor beam.

43:11.825 --> 43:13.577
Take out those prisoner tabs.

43:20.375 --> 43:21.752
Deconstructor focused.

43:21.835 --> 43:22.961
I hope I don't miss.

43:26.506 --> 43:27.799
Nice shot. Barely singed him.

43:33.430 --> 43:35.390
Maintain fire.
Protect the grublings.

43:35.474 --> 43:38.227
Quick, quick. Get out.
Go. Go. Go.

43:41.730 --> 43:43.232
Rigging teleporter
systems online.

43:45.776 --> 43:46.944
Where's my dad?

43:47.027 --> 43:48.070
Get down!

43:48.153 --> 43:49.154
Get him!

43:49.238 --> 43:50.656
Get who, sir?

43:50.739 --> 43:52.241
Allbright. Who else?

43:57.079 --> 43:59.164
<i>Ferkel</i> is in position
to beam them up.

43:59.248 --> 44:00.666
On your mark, Captain.

44:02.167 --> 44:04.294
I almost got them.
Almost got them.

44:04.836 --> 44:07.005
Got them!
Yeah!

44:07.089 --> 44:08.131
All right, all right.

44:09.925 --> 44:11.218
Okay.

44:11.301 --> 44:15.013
Not that Allbright.
The other one, you bug-brain!

44:15.097 --> 44:16.515
Sorry.

44:16.598 --> 44:17.933
Take him to the tunnel.

44:18.350 --> 44:19.351
No.

44:19.434 --> 44:20.894
You have to save my dad.

44:20.978 --> 44:23.814
B'kr's personal bubble field
is blocking our teleporter.

44:24.314 --> 44:27.401
We can't give up on our commander.
We have to find a way.

44:29.945 --> 44:32.030
B'kr, throw down your blaster.

44:32.781 --> 44:34.366
<i>Release Ah-rit at once.</i>

44:34.449 --> 44:35.617
<i>Grakker, no.</i>

44:35.701 --> 44:37.452
<i>Protect Rod. Forget about me, okay?</i>

44:37.536 --> 44:39.580
I'm gonna be fine. Just get Roddie...

44:39.663 --> 44:42.249
<i>Good idea, Grakker.</i>

44:42.708 --> 44:45.168
<i>Oh, Roddie. I know you're listening.</i>

44:45.711 --> 44:48.088
<i>That setting just stunned your dad.</i>

44:48.171 --> 44:50.507
<i>Next one, and he'll be flatlined.</i>

44:50.591 --> 44:53.135
<i>So get out here now.</i>

44:53.218 --> 44:54.887
Captain Grakker, send me out.

44:54.970 --> 44:56.847
I'll do whatever it takes to save my dad.

44:56.930 --> 44:57.931
So will I.

44:58.015 --> 45:01.518
My Captain, if these grublings
truly will do anything that is required,

45:01.602 --> 45:02.853
there is one last thing to try.

45:03.312 --> 45:05.898
Perilous, to be sure,
but possible even so.

45:05.981 --> 45:07.941
Starting a countdown, Roddie.

45:08.025 --> 45:11.195
You've got 10 seconds
to save your dad's life.

45:11.778 --> 45:12.821
You're serious?

45:12.905 --> 45:13.906
You can actually do that?

45:13.989 --> 45:15.866
- Ten...
- That's so messed up.

45:15.949 --> 45:18.243
- <i>Nine.</i>
- Rod? Elspeth?

45:18.327 --> 45:20.704
- <i>Eight.</i>
- You both understand the terrible risk...

45:20.787 --> 45:22.706
- <i>Seven.</i>
- ...and that I cannot guarantee success.

45:22.789 --> 45:24.583
- <i>Six.</i>
- Whatever it takes to save my dad.

45:24.666 --> 45:26.251
- <i>Five.</i>
- Whatever it takes to stop B'kr.

45:26.335 --> 45:27.502
<i>Four.</i>

45:27.586 --> 45:29.755
<i>Three, a-two, a-one.</i>

45:29.838 --> 45:30.839
B'kr.

45:31.632 --> 45:33.175
You win.

45:34.259 --> 45:35.385
<i>It's what I do.</i>

45:35.469 --> 45:36.762
"It's what I do."

45:46.688 --> 45:48.857
<i>You got what
you came for, B'kr.</i>

45:48.941 --> 45:50.317
Release Ah-rit.

46:11.421 --> 46:12.589
Hello, Pudge-Boy.

46:15.884 --> 46:18.136
I can't wait to dig
into that pathetic brain of yours

46:18.220 --> 46:20.264
to snag the prize inside.

46:51.795 --> 46:54.089
There are no signs
of neuron combustion.

46:54.172 --> 46:55.883
Her brain is not fried.

46:55.966 --> 46:59.761
But I'm not seeing any indication
of any higher brain function at all.

47:00.512 --> 47:01.513
Oh!

47:02.806 --> 47:04.641
Re-setting for Earthlings.

47:06.602 --> 47:08.061
All good.

47:11.607 --> 47:12.608
Rod?

47:13.150 --> 47:14.401
Mickey, I'm Els...

47:14.818 --> 47:15.819
Els...

47:18.447 --> 47:20.073
What say you, young deputy?

47:20.616 --> 47:22.951
Mickey, it's me, Rod.
I'm here.

47:23.702 --> 47:25.495
Oh, this is so not right.

47:25.579 --> 47:27.623
Uh, you mean, so cool.

47:27.706 --> 47:30.167
Two minds in one brain.
How can they both fit in there?

47:30.250 --> 47:31.877
It's not like Rod's very...

47:32.544 --> 47:33.545
Rod, stop it.

47:34.004 --> 47:35.255
You stop it.

47:36.965 --> 47:40.093
Oh. I am gratified
to have succeeded in building

47:40.177 --> 47:41.887
a psychic bridge between you two.

47:42.596 --> 47:43.639
So am I, Tar.

47:44.139 --> 47:45.933
Oh! Commander Allbright.

47:46.016 --> 47:47.017
It's good to have you back

47:47.100 --> 47:49.102
onboard the, uh, <i>Ferkel.</i>

47:50.646 --> 47:52.439
Rod? Rod.

47:53.857 --> 47:55.025
I'm here, Dad.

47:55.108 --> 47:57.819
Son, I never meant
for you to be drawn into any of this.

47:59.571 --> 48:01.323
- Elspeth?
- Present.

48:02.950 --> 48:05.244
I promise I'll make this right.

48:06.620 --> 48:08.121
Everyone to the flight deck.

48:08.205 --> 48:09.915
This crew has a new mission.

48:14.336 --> 48:15.337
Guys?

48:17.172 --> 48:19.341
Guys? Hello?

48:20.342 --> 48:22.594
Hello? Anyone there?

48:22.678 --> 48:25.764
Uh, I don't know how to turn it off.

48:25.847 --> 48:26.848
Well, Grakker, don't...

48:26.932 --> 48:28.141
I'll get someone.

48:28.225 --> 48:29.685
Don't leave! Argh!

48:36.441 --> 48:39.236
So, where is the brightest member
of the crew?

48:39.778 --> 48:41.280
- Plink?
- Plink!

48:41.363 --> 48:44.950
Hey. What am I? Chopped kindling?

48:45.367 --> 48:48.745
Phillogenous esk Piemondum,
so glad to see you

48:48.829 --> 48:50.497
haven't crashed the ship yet.

48:50.581 --> 48:52.165
Not for lack of trying.

48:52.249 --> 48:54.918
Might wanna ease up on
the late-night chlorophylls.

48:56.628 --> 48:58.672
- Whoa.
- Okay. Yep. Mmm-hmm.

49:00.048 --> 49:03.260
Rod, pay attention. I am not clumsy.

49:04.094 --> 49:05.262
They're your feet.

49:09.182 --> 49:10.517
Rod!

49:11.518 --> 49:12.519
Strange creatures.

49:16.356 --> 49:17.774
Young deputies.

49:17.858 --> 49:19.484
Sorry, Tar Gibbons.

49:20.235 --> 49:21.403
Sorry's not the half of it.

49:21.486 --> 49:24.740
Hey, hey, hey.
This won't last long, you two.

49:25.991 --> 49:27.868
All right. Attention, everyone.

49:28.577 --> 49:31.121
We will stop B'kr.

49:31.955 --> 49:33.749
We will save the galaxy,

49:34.458 --> 49:37.753
and we will do so
before B'kr has a chance to realize

49:37.836 --> 49:40.631
that all he has is Rod's body,
and decides to...

49:41.465 --> 49:44.384
And what'll B'kr do
if he finds out my body's mindless?

49:44.468 --> 49:45.802
- Well...
- Commander.

49:46.261 --> 49:49.681
I think it best if you share
the whole situation for your crew.

49:51.099 --> 49:52.476
Probably not the best idea.

49:53.101 --> 49:55.896
Uh, definitely, uh, not for the best.

49:56.438 --> 49:57.814
There could be screaming.

49:57.898 --> 49:59.650
- I think we already know.
- Even I know.

49:59.733 --> 50:02.653
When B'kr finds out
he doesn't have Rod's mind

50:02.736 --> 50:06.365
with the information about where to put
his Mega Time Trap, he could...

50:06.448 --> 50:07.908
Throw my body out an airlock.

50:07.991 --> 50:12.287
He could, but remember,
B'kr always needs an audience.

50:12.371 --> 50:14.039
Millions have wept.

50:14.540 --> 50:17.918
What he's more likely to do
is capture more hostages.

50:18.293 --> 50:19.294
Mom.

50:19.545 --> 50:20.546
The twins.

50:20.629 --> 50:21.964
That's not gonna happen

50:22.047 --> 50:25.842
because we are
gonna get to them before he does.

50:27.135 --> 50:28.136
Phil,

50:29.054 --> 50:30.055
if you would.

50:31.473 --> 50:32.599
What do you mean, "if I'm wood"?

50:32.683 --> 50:33.767
- Plink!
- Of course I'm wood.

50:33.850 --> 50:36.061
Oh. Got it. Never mind.

50:36.144 --> 50:37.396
Not that I have one.

50:38.188 --> 50:40.274
The <i>Ferkel</i> is go.

50:41.483 --> 50:42.818
Mmm...

50:43.944 --> 50:46.446
Just a second. We are go now.

50:49.491 --> 50:50.534
Any time.

50:50.617 --> 50:53.287
And now.

51:22.316 --> 51:23.901
Why won't you work?

51:35.370 --> 51:37.456
Think of this as a little sneak preview.

51:37.539 --> 51:39.458
A little tidbit on how all the Allbrights

51:39.541 --> 51:41.960
are gonna be screaming
in terror forever.

51:43.378 --> 51:46.131
Ah! And all thanks to you, Roddie.

51:46.215 --> 51:48.467
How's it make you feel, Pudge-Boy?

51:50.427 --> 51:53.180
Uh, Leader Zupreme.

51:53.263 --> 51:54.723
What now, bug-brain?

51:54.806 --> 51:59.853
About what you said
about us looking for a brain...

52:02.231 --> 52:03.315
Get out of here. Go.

52:07.945 --> 52:09.071
No brain activity?

52:09.863 --> 52:10.864
What?

52:14.910 --> 52:15.911
Argh!

52:21.333 --> 52:23.043
You sure Madame Pong said that's food?

52:23.877 --> 52:27.256
Well, technically,
"ingestible energy compounds

52:27.339 --> 52:30.926
"not likely to cause
severe digestive upset

52:31.426 --> 52:33.387
"in non-paper-eating species."

52:38.225 --> 52:40.269
Mmm. Not too bad.

52:42.854 --> 52:43.939
Oh, a bit spicy.

52:45.899 --> 52:49.444
Yeah. That's...
That's a lot spicy, actually.

52:51.488 --> 52:52.531
It sort of tastes like...

52:54.074 --> 52:55.826
Fire!

52:55.909 --> 52:57.494
Fire!

52:59.955 --> 53:00.956
Mmm.

53:04.835 --> 53:06.295
Water!

53:10.465 --> 53:11.592
I dare you.

53:13.552 --> 53:14.678
You're out of your mind.

53:14.761 --> 53:16.305
Obviously.

53:18.473 --> 53:19.766
How are you two holding up?

53:19.850 --> 53:21.184
One of us is, Uncle Art.

53:24.062 --> 53:25.480
And it's not her.

53:26.690 --> 53:27.941
Rod, don't you dare.

53:28.859 --> 53:29.860
Rod.

53:34.323 --> 53:35.782
- Rod.
- Stand down.

53:36.700 --> 53:37.784
Both of you.

53:39.494 --> 53:42.748
Rod, Elspeth, listen to me.

53:43.165 --> 53:45.375
I know how hard
this must be for both of you,

53:45.459 --> 53:49.755
but Tar has given me
something that just might help.

53:52.299 --> 53:54.760
A dimensional window of pure forandus.

53:54.843 --> 53:55.969
What does it do?

53:56.762 --> 53:57.804
I'm not sure.

53:58.639 --> 53:59.640
Let's find out.

54:03.352 --> 54:04.853
Nothing's happening.

54:16.949 --> 54:18.158
Where are we?

54:19.201 --> 54:21.036
Probably in Tar's mind.

54:21.620 --> 54:23.914
He's good at creating psychic delusions.

54:25.415 --> 54:26.667
Wherever we are...

54:29.086 --> 54:30.212
I'm just glad you're here.

54:30.837 --> 54:32.172
I missed you so much.

54:33.757 --> 54:35.008
When we get home, son,

54:37.010 --> 54:38.428
I'm staying put.

54:39.221 --> 54:42.391
Really, Dad?
I mean, you're commander of a starship.

54:42.474 --> 54:44.726
If I had a ship like this,
I'd wanna go everywhere.

54:46.436 --> 54:49.356
I know the feeling.
And when I had the chance, I did.

54:51.024 --> 54:52.109
Then I met your mother.

54:53.151 --> 54:54.403
Fifteen years ago,

54:55.821 --> 54:58.198
when I finally figured out
what B'kr was up to,

54:58.282 --> 54:59.992
I took everything I could from the lab

55:00.075 --> 55:01.368
and hid it in the Mentat.

55:02.035 --> 55:04.413
B'kr came searching for me, of course,

55:06.373 --> 55:09.334
so Tar Gibbons helped me hide on Earth.

55:11.336 --> 55:13.171
I landed in good old Seldom Seen.

55:14.590 --> 55:15.591
That's where I met your mom.

55:19.094 --> 55:20.512
<i>And we fell in love.</i>

55:25.350 --> 55:30.188
That's when I decided
that I'd been exploring long enough.

55:30.814 --> 55:33.609
So I gave it all up for my new home,

55:34.484 --> 55:35.694
my new family.

55:39.031 --> 55:41.074
I was content at last.

55:41.617 --> 55:43.702
Then why did you leave us?

55:45.120 --> 55:49.541
Well, that night,
the Patrol sent a ship to warn me

55:49.625 --> 55:52.502
that B'kr was on his way
to Earth to search for me.

55:53.212 --> 55:57.382
To keep you all safe, I couldn't let B'kr
connect any of you to me,

55:57.466 --> 55:58.508
so I had to leave right away.

55:58.967 --> 56:01.887
I'll come back, Rod. I promise.

56:03.931 --> 56:05.349
Why'd you go to the Mentat?

56:06.391 --> 56:08.644
Well, my plan was
to work there for a few weeks,

56:09.269 --> 56:10.979
to come up with something new
to stop B'kr.

56:12.522 --> 56:15.025
Instead, I got caught
in his Micro Time Trap.

56:15.901 --> 56:17.110
Until you.

56:18.904 --> 56:20.155
You found me.

56:23.075 --> 56:24.159
You saved me.

56:41.718 --> 56:42.719
Uh, we're back.

56:42.803 --> 56:43.887
More or less.

56:44.304 --> 56:47.641
Why are you wearing those strange
alien uniforms, and where's Rod?

56:48.016 --> 56:49.309
We should probably

56:50.018 --> 56:52.229
all come inside first.

56:52.563 --> 56:53.564
"All"?

57:12.457 --> 57:14.668
The <i>Ferkel!</i> Yay!

57:16.169 --> 57:17.504
The <i>Ferkel?</i>

57:17.754 --> 57:18.755
Wow!

57:32.644 --> 57:33.812
Oh, Art!

57:33.896 --> 57:35.022
- Sorry.
- Daddy!

57:35.105 --> 57:36.440
I'm so sorry, love.

57:37.983 --> 57:40.611
- Oh, my gosh.
- Look at you. Hey!

57:40.944 --> 57:42.237
You're so big.

57:44.114 --> 57:47.201
We are witnessing
that which brings joy to the universe.

57:47.743 --> 57:50.370
A family gathered together
in a bunch like that,

57:50.454 --> 57:52.831
it makes me weep like a willow.

57:52.915 --> 57:57.669
It is truly humbling to see the heartfelt
ties that binds all Allbrights.

57:58.337 --> 58:00.130
Until they start talking.

58:02.341 --> 58:03.884
Hey, hey, hey!

58:07.054 --> 58:08.513
Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

58:09.723 --> 58:10.766
Where have you been?

58:11.433 --> 58:12.976
How could you do this to us?

58:13.060 --> 58:14.394
Listen to me. I will tell you everything,

58:14.478 --> 58:16.313
but now is not the time.

58:16.396 --> 58:17.564
No.

58:18.190 --> 58:20.234
You have been gone for five years.

58:20.317 --> 58:21.610
This is the time.

58:22.319 --> 58:23.320
And Rod...

58:24.112 --> 58:25.239
Where's Rod?

58:26.240 --> 58:27.241
Tell me.

58:31.620 --> 58:34.122
Elspeth, do you know where he is?

58:37.251 --> 58:38.252
Hi, Mom.

58:38.877 --> 58:41.547
Long story short, I'm Rod.

58:42.464 --> 58:43.465
What?

58:45.384 --> 58:48.512
It's complicated, but it's true.

58:49.304 --> 58:51.682
Rod's mind is sharing Elspeth's brain.

58:52.808 --> 58:54.142
But how?

58:56.103 --> 58:57.104
I'll tell you all later.

58:57.187 --> 58:58.188
We've gotta go.

59:00.357 --> 59:01.400
A dimensional rift has opened.

59:01.483 --> 59:02.776
Oh, no. B'kr.

59:04.736 --> 59:06.029
- Okay, guys. Okay.
- What do we do?

59:06.113 --> 59:07.865
Excuse me. We've gotta...
We gotta go, okay?

59:07.948 --> 59:09.408
- Let's go.
- Stay with Mommy and Daddy, okay?

59:09.491 --> 59:10.492
We've gotta go now.

59:24.381 --> 59:27.551
Prisoners, surrender.

59:27.634 --> 59:28.886
Identify yourself.

59:29.386 --> 59:32.973
Arly Bung, Mentat Chief of Security.

59:33.599 --> 59:36.184
I'm here for Captain Grakker,

59:36.268 --> 59:38.478
and I'm arresting

59:38.562 --> 59:41.189
all the rest of his accomplices.

59:42.316 --> 59:44.359
- Art, what is that thing?
- Chief, wait.

59:45.110 --> 59:46.403
These Earthlings are innocent.

59:47.029 --> 59:49.865
They're being threatened by B'kr himself.

59:49.948 --> 59:53.076
Aw, ask me if I care.

59:53.493 --> 59:55.954
- What?
- Because I don't.

59:56.038 --> 59:58.540
Elspeth, Mickey, take the twins and run.

59:58.624 --> 1:00:00.626
Go, go, go!

1:00:00.709 --> 1:00:05.672
Oh, air-breathers. So predictable.

1:00:11.845 --> 1:00:14.473
- Ah, boogers!
- Great.

1:00:15.015 --> 1:00:16.433
Now I'm a frozen vegetable.

1:00:26.610 --> 1:00:28.028
Billy Becker?

1:00:28.111 --> 1:00:29.154
B'kr.

1:00:29.696 --> 1:00:32.074
I see you've met my Mentat spy.

1:00:32.658 --> 1:00:35.619
She's a true fish out of water.

1:00:37.204 --> 1:00:39.498
No, no, no. None of this is real.

1:00:40.290 --> 1:00:43.961
I'm as real as it gets, baby.

1:00:50.384 --> 1:00:54.388
One of you is gonna tell me
where you've hidden Rod's mind

1:00:54.471 --> 1:00:57.266
because every hour you make me wait,

1:00:57.808 --> 1:01:03.564
I'm gonna drop one of you losers
down a bottomless black hole.

1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:07.568
How could anyone wanna help B'kr

1:01:07.651 --> 1:01:09.695
freeze the galaxy in a moment of time?

1:01:09.778 --> 1:01:11.071
That's so stupid it hurts.

1:01:11.154 --> 1:01:13.115
Someone has to do something.

1:01:13.198 --> 1:01:15.200
The galaxy is a hot mess.

1:01:15.659 --> 1:01:17.661
Asteroids are slamming into planets,

1:01:17.744 --> 1:01:19.538
supernovas popping off at random,

1:01:19.621 --> 1:01:22.749
a whole gazillion stars colliding!

1:01:23.208 --> 1:01:25.502
But B'kr's promised total order.

1:01:25.586 --> 1:01:27.838
No more chaos, no more change.

1:01:27.921 --> 1:01:30.090
Oh, look, everyone, it's Angry Bung.

1:01:30.674 --> 1:01:33.468
<i>Things will finally stay the same.</i>

1:01:33.552 --> 1:01:35.888
The same and the same and the same.

1:01:37.055 --> 1:01:42.102
And in that one infinitely clean
and tidy moment,

1:01:42.811 --> 1:01:46.023
<i>I'll be living the dream forever.</i>

1:01:47.024 --> 1:01:49.443
Sounds like someone's
a few kernels short of a cob.

1:01:50.611 --> 1:01:52.571
At least we've got lots of time
to come up with an escape plan.

1:01:53.238 --> 1:01:56.116
The nearest black hole
to Earth is nearly 3,000 light years away.

1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:58.952
Wrong.

1:01:59.703 --> 1:02:00.871
March with me.

1:02:01.496 --> 1:02:03.582
- And a-one, two.
- Come on.

1:02:03.665 --> 1:02:04.875
Stay behind me, guys.

1:02:05.417 --> 1:02:06.793
Come on. A little faster now.

1:02:07.252 --> 1:02:09.213
- Stay close.
- Giddy up!

1:02:29.399 --> 1:02:31.693
Haroop.
Haroop.

1:02:32.152 --> 1:02:33.153
Haroop.

1:02:33.237 --> 1:02:34.738
Haroop.

1:02:36.406 --> 1:02:41.036
Anyone wanna plead for mercy
before we take a little stroll

1:02:41.119 --> 1:02:44.831
all the way over
to my favorite black hole?

1:02:44.915 --> 1:02:46.124
What black hole?

1:02:46.208 --> 1:02:48.877
The one on the other side of
this interdimensional portal.

1:02:59.763 --> 1:03:00.764
March!

1:03:00.847 --> 1:03:03.642
Gwen!

1:03:18.740 --> 1:03:20.367
Ah, humans are so slow.

1:03:22.953 --> 1:03:23.996
Okey-dokey.

1:03:24.079 --> 1:03:25.622
Here I come, mama.

1:03:25.956 --> 1:03:27.082
Here we go.

1:03:29.334 --> 1:03:32.296
What on Earth,
or wherever, are you?

1:03:34.423 --> 1:03:37.092
I'm your worst daydream.

1:03:37.467 --> 1:03:38.468
"Nightmare."

1:03:39.261 --> 1:03:40.762
- Uh...
- Really? Huh?

1:03:40.846 --> 1:03:43.932
- How many times?
- Sorry.

1:03:46.602 --> 1:03:50.772
- Uh, sorry, sir.
- I forgot your debigginer...

1:03:50.856 --> 1:03:53.066
Thank you. What a waste.

1:03:53.525 --> 1:03:56.278
Grublings don't need prisoner tabs.

1:03:56.653 --> 1:03:58.572
If they try to escape...

1:03:59.907 --> 1:04:00.908
Well...

1:04:02.409 --> 1:04:03.952
Just sit on them...

1:04:06.622 --> 1:04:08.624
- until they pop.
- Ew!

1:04:09.499 --> 1:04:11.126
Popping grublings.

1:04:11.210 --> 1:04:13.295
Always seems to make me laugh.

1:04:14.504 --> 1:04:17.341
Close the portal
and move the <i>Ferkel</i> to the lab.

1:04:17.424 --> 1:04:20.427
If anyone escapes,
blast them to quarks.

1:04:22.679 --> 1:04:25.807
Gotta get to the <i>Ferkel,</i> please.

1:04:27.351 --> 1:04:28.352
Lackey, hurry up.

1:04:28.852 --> 1:04:30.604
<i>I'm trying. I'm trying.</i>

1:04:30.687 --> 1:04:31.688
<i>I don't have all day.</i>

1:04:37.110 --> 1:04:38.278
Yeah.

1:04:38.362 --> 1:04:41.281
<i>Lackey, the best</i>

1:04:43.242 --> 1:04:46.703
The rest of you,
welcome to the <i>Doomstar.</i>

1:04:46.787 --> 1:04:49.081
It may be a little crowded
until we start tossing

1:04:49.164 --> 1:04:51.375
one or two of them
out the airlock.

1:04:51.959 --> 1:04:53.794
Eric, Linda, stay close to Mom.

1:04:54.294 --> 1:04:55.295
Everyone's gonna be okay.

1:04:55.379 --> 1:04:57.923
And people say I'm delusional.

1:04:58.840 --> 1:04:59.841
Hold on.

1:04:59.925 --> 1:05:00.926
One second.

1:05:05.514 --> 1:05:07.808
Oh, don't worry
about Sleeping Beauty.

1:05:07.891 --> 1:05:12.437
I'll be sure to thaw out the Pudge-Boy
before I activate my Mega Time Trap.

1:05:12.521 --> 1:05:16.483
I mean, why make a moment
of total triumph last forever

1:05:16.567 --> 1:05:20.487
if you can't share it
with your defeated foes?

1:05:21.905 --> 1:05:24.324
Lackey hates the Leader Zupreme.

1:05:24.408 --> 1:05:27.244
"Lackey do this, Lackey do that."

1:05:27.327 --> 1:05:30.289
Lackey needs a vacation.

1:05:30.372 --> 1:05:32.666
<i>But Leader Zupreme doesn't care.</i>

1:05:32.749 --> 1:05:36.879
If it wasn't for the bugs. Bugs...

1:05:36.962 --> 1:05:41.049
<i>Oh, the Leader Zupreme
does give me bugs.</i>

1:05:41.133 --> 1:05:44.428
<i>Zlurpy, luscious</i> <i>bugs.</i>

1:05:45.304 --> 1:05:46.889
Ugh.

1:05:46.972 --> 1:05:50.392
Lackey loves the Leader Zupreme.

1:05:50.475 --> 1:05:53.645
<i>Now to get the Galactic Patrolz
out of the</i> Ferkelz.

1:05:53.729 --> 1:05:58.817
So, fun fact.
My ship's orbiting a ginormous black hole

1:05:58.901 --> 1:06:01.069
right at the edge of the event horizon.

1:06:01.153 --> 1:06:06.200
Linda and Eric,
do either of you know what happens

1:06:06.283 --> 1:06:08.076
if you get swallowed up by a black hole?

1:06:09.286 --> 1:06:11.580
Squishy, squishy.

1:06:11.663 --> 1:06:13.582
Don't you dare bully my children.

1:06:13.665 --> 1:06:16.793
If you've got something to say, B'kr,
you say it to me.

1:06:16.877 --> 1:06:20.422
Okay, Mom and Dad,
here's the real question.

1:06:20.505 --> 1:06:23.133
Do you love these
little space rats enough

1:06:23.217 --> 1:06:24.760
to tell me where
Rod's tiny mind is hiding?

1:06:24.843 --> 1:06:26.053
So you can what?

1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:27.930
Destroy the galaxy?

1:06:28.013 --> 1:06:32.559
I like to think that I'm preserving it
forever.

1:06:33.602 --> 1:06:34.603
How about it, Mom?

1:06:38.774 --> 1:06:40.192
No idea.

1:06:40.901 --> 1:06:43.028
Right, then. Who's first?

1:06:43.529 --> 1:06:45.531
You stay away from my family.

1:06:45.614 --> 1:06:47.824
Someone needs a nap.

1:06:51.036 --> 1:06:52.996
Now, where was I?

1:06:53.622 --> 1:06:55.332
Oh, yeah.

1:07:13.392 --> 1:07:15.060
<i>Tar, I have to tell B'kr I'm here,</i>

1:07:15.143 --> 1:07:16.395
<i>but Elspeth's blocking me.</i>

1:07:16.478 --> 1:07:18.063
<i>Not yet, young Rod.</i>

1:07:18.146 --> 1:07:20.357
<i>B'kr won't act until he's certain</i>

1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:22.901
<i>he's inflicted maximum cruelty
on his victims.</i>

1:07:23.443 --> 1:07:25.362
<i>For now, we must trust in Phil.</i>

1:07:25.696 --> 1:07:26.697
<i>Phil?</i>

1:07:26.780 --> 1:07:29.658
<i>He has a plan
to gain our freedom.</i>

1:07:30.158 --> 1:07:31.618
Hey, you with the thorax.

1:07:31.702 --> 1:07:32.703
Yeah?

1:07:32.786 --> 1:07:35.789
Check out this bi-pedal
meat monstrosity next to me.

1:07:35.873 --> 1:07:37.165
- Yeah?
- Meat.

1:07:37.749 --> 1:07:39.626
Wait. What'd you call me?

1:07:39.710 --> 1:07:41.420
He's a Friskian Fighter.

1:07:41.503 --> 1:07:44.214
They're famous for being
the goofiest clowns in the galaxy.

1:07:44.298 --> 1:07:45.883
I'm... What?

1:07:45.966 --> 1:07:48.677
Have you heard animals have this thing
called the nervous system?

1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:49.887
Laughable, I know.

1:07:49.970 --> 1:07:51.680
Who needs to be more nervous. Am I right?

1:07:51.763 --> 1:07:53.682
But in Friskians,

1:07:53.765 --> 1:07:56.226
their nervous system makes them, get this,

1:07:56.310 --> 1:07:58.145
completely programmable.

1:07:58.228 --> 1:08:00.397
You can make them
do anything you want.

1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:02.858
Phil, to avoid your own death,

1:08:02.941 --> 1:08:04.443
you should stop now.

1:08:05.027 --> 1:08:08.614
I'm just getting started,
you hilarious hunk of ambulatory protein.

1:08:08.697 --> 1:08:11.950
See for yourself. Press that big blue
behavior adjustor button

1:08:12.034 --> 1:08:14.703
on his control pad there
and he'll do anything you say.

1:08:15.287 --> 1:08:18.707
Totally.

1:08:18.790 --> 1:08:20.334
- Huh?
- Totally correct.

1:08:20.417 --> 1:08:21.752
Huh...

1:08:21.835 --> 1:08:24.004
The control pad
on my <i>Ferkel</i> remote contr...

1:08:24.087 --> 1:08:27.633
Uh, behavior adjustor thing.

1:08:27.716 --> 1:08:33.138
Phil, how cruel of you
to expose poor Grakker's weakness.

1:08:33.222 --> 1:08:34.223
Yeah.

1:08:34.306 --> 1:08:36.600
You can make him sing, dance, tell jokes.

1:08:36.683 --> 1:08:38.352
Your boss would love that, yes?

1:08:38.435 --> 1:08:40.687
- Probably give you a big reward.
- Huh?

1:08:40.771 --> 1:08:41.772
Something like...

1:08:41.855 --> 1:08:43.982
Like bugz?

1:08:44.066 --> 1:08:46.276
Just what I was thinking. Yummy!

1:08:48.820 --> 1:08:52.031
Oh, no. Don't press
the second blue button...

1:08:52.115 --> 1:08:54.326
which focuses
the energy beam on me.

1:08:54.409 --> 1:08:55.410
This one?

1:09:07.214 --> 1:09:08.882
Oh, my bad.

1:09:10.049 --> 1:09:11.718
Hey, coochie, coochie, coochie.

1:09:11.802 --> 1:09:13.762
- Huh?
- Meet Mr. Goof.

1:09:27.234 --> 1:09:28.235
Ah!

1:09:28.819 --> 1:09:31.029
So much better.

1:09:32.281 --> 1:09:35.491
But it was useful in case
some human saw me.

1:09:36.326 --> 1:09:37.369
Ah.

1:09:41.623 --> 1:09:43.000
Wakey, wakey.

1:09:46.253 --> 1:09:47.337
Art!

1:09:48.504 --> 1:09:50.048
Gwen, no. No.

1:09:50.799 --> 1:09:53.509
Aw, family reunions.

1:09:53.969 --> 1:09:56.430
So sticky sweet they make my teeth hurt.

1:09:58.473 --> 1:10:01.226
<i>Tar Gibbons,
B'kr's gonna drop Mom into the black hole.</i>

1:10:01.310 --> 1:10:02.978
<i>I have to tell him
what he wants to know.</i>

1:10:03.061 --> 1:10:06.148
<i>No, young deputy.
There is one final thing to try.</i>

1:10:06.690 --> 1:10:08.233
<i>If you can distract B'kr...</i>

1:10:08.317 --> 1:10:10.485
Ah, I could do this all day.

1:10:10.569 --> 1:10:12.738
If only we had more time.

1:10:12.821 --> 1:10:14.489
<i>He's distracted. He's distracted.</i>

1:10:14.573 --> 1:10:17.576
<i>Then listen carefully,
young Rod and young Elspeth.</i>

1:10:18.202 --> 1:10:20.370
Ah. Ah! You know what's even better

1:10:20.454 --> 1:10:23.999
than tossing Spacemom
out the airlock into a giant black hole?

1:10:24.082 --> 1:10:28.795
Starting a countdown
to tossing Spacemom out the... And so on.

1:10:30.464 --> 1:10:31.465
No.

1:10:41.225 --> 1:10:42.851
Ugh!

1:10:43.644 --> 1:10:44.853
Gross.

1:10:45.395 --> 1:10:46.396
Disgusting.

1:10:47.022 --> 1:10:48.023
Oh, okay.

1:10:48.106 --> 1:10:50.359
Sick. Dirty.

1:10:50.442 --> 1:10:51.985
Trash. Trash.

1:10:52.069 --> 1:10:54.071
There's trash everywhere.

1:10:54.154 --> 1:10:55.155
Everywhere.

1:10:59.785 --> 1:11:01.119
Okay.

1:11:01.787 --> 1:11:02.955
Ah, look.

1:11:11.547 --> 1:11:13.215
Oh, you want to play like that, do you?

1:11:13.298 --> 1:11:14.466
Yeah, yeah.

1:11:21.473 --> 1:11:22.891
Oh, boy. I got it.

1:11:22.975 --> 1:11:24.351
I am building his confidence.

1:11:24.434 --> 1:11:25.852
Obviously.

1:11:27.354 --> 1:11:29.273
I see you are somewhat wise

1:11:29.356 --> 1:11:31.400
in the ways of warrior science.

1:11:32.192 --> 1:11:34.528
You are an almost-worthy foe. Ha-ha!

1:11:37.573 --> 1:11:38.574
Eh.

1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:54.256
I claim victory!

1:12:22.743 --> 1:12:23.744
What is that?

1:12:25.329 --> 1:12:26.538
I love you.

1:12:27.831 --> 1:12:29.541
Save our children.

1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:32.628
Aw, I love you too.

1:12:32.711 --> 1:12:33.712
Please.

1:12:33.795 --> 1:12:35.589
And don't worry. The kids will be fine.

1:12:35.672 --> 1:12:37.007
The black hole will look after them.

1:13:06.578 --> 1:13:07.829
Fly swatted.

1:13:07.913 --> 1:13:10.082
You can't knock
the wind out of me, Friskian.

1:13:10.165 --> 1:13:13.335
Insects don't have lungs!

1:13:14.711 --> 1:13:17.005
Rod, wake up!

1:13:17.089 --> 1:13:19.299
Wake up, Rod.

1:13:19.383 --> 1:13:21.718
Rod, wake up. Rod!

1:13:21.802 --> 1:13:23.595
Wake up!

1:13:25.973 --> 1:13:26.974
Rod?

1:13:27.766 --> 1:13:28.767
Elspeth?

1:13:28.850 --> 1:13:30.435
I'm back in my body.

1:13:30.811 --> 1:13:31.812
And I'm alone in mine.

1:13:31.895 --> 1:13:32.896
Yay!

1:13:33.647 --> 1:13:34.648
What now?

1:13:36.149 --> 1:13:37.317
I'm gonna need your hats.

1:13:37.901 --> 1:13:40.028
I'll get the twins back to the bridge
before B'kr sees we're gone.

1:13:40.112 --> 1:13:41.113
Come on, let's go.

1:13:42.155 --> 1:13:43.532
- Come on.
- I can help too.

1:13:43.615 --> 1:13:45.284
Those prisoner tabs.

1:13:47.411 --> 1:13:48.620
You know how to use them?

1:13:50.497 --> 1:13:51.498
Yeah, look.

1:13:53.166 --> 1:13:55.794
And I think
I can turn them all off at once.

1:13:57.045 --> 1:13:58.046
Get them ready.

1:14:01.091 --> 1:14:02.092
What are you gonna do?

1:14:04.428 --> 1:14:05.888
Just watch me.

1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:10.017
Ugh! Dusty.

1:14:12.019 --> 1:14:14.521
Mom and Dad,
this will all end if you just tell me

1:14:14.605 --> 1:14:15.981
where you've hidden Rod's mind.

1:14:16.064 --> 1:14:17.149
Never.

1:14:17.232 --> 1:14:19.026
Argh! "Never."

1:14:19.818 --> 1:14:23.113
All right, kids. Everyone with me now.

1:14:23.739 --> 1:14:26.950
Ten, nine, eight,

1:14:27.659 --> 1:14:29.620
seven, six...

1:14:29.703 --> 1:14:32.164
Where is Mickey?

1:14:32.247 --> 1:14:33.790
Where's Mickey?

1:14:40.839 --> 1:14:41.840
No!

1:14:54.686 --> 1:14:55.687
Oh.

1:14:57.147 --> 1:14:58.607
Plink!

1:15:06.990 --> 1:15:07.991
Plink!

1:15:10.577 --> 1:15:12.329
You've been Plinked.

1:15:23.298 --> 1:15:25.384
Galactic Patrol, prepare the debigginer,

1:15:25.467 --> 1:15:27.553
and prepare to teleport aboard the <i>Ferkel.</i>

1:15:30.472 --> 1:15:32.474
Get him!

1:15:32.808 --> 1:15:34.017
Art.

1:15:38.230 --> 1:15:39.731
Frizzim spezzack!

1:15:41.984 --> 1:15:43.944
You're making everything slippery.

1:15:44.236 --> 1:15:45.237
Sticky!

1:15:51.785 --> 1:15:53.370
I love you, Gwendolyn Jean.

1:15:53.453 --> 1:15:56.331
You better, because you are
in so much trouble, mister.

1:15:56.415 --> 1:15:58.125
I'm so sorry.

1:15:58.667 --> 1:15:59.668
Just stop it.

1:16:01.169 --> 1:16:02.170
Enough!

1:16:04.464 --> 1:16:07.551
I will blast the next biped who moves.

1:16:07.968 --> 1:16:10.345
Space larva, get off my fire.

1:16:11.430 --> 1:16:14.725
Spacemom, get back in the airlock.

1:16:14.808 --> 1:16:17.895
- I am not even gonna start a countdown.
- Ugh!

1:16:17.978 --> 1:16:20.856
And, Dad, I'm gonna shoot you

1:16:21.857 --> 1:16:23.734
just because.

1:16:25.819 --> 1:16:26.820
Hey!

1:16:28.614 --> 1:16:30.324
You want my brain?

1:16:30.407 --> 1:16:31.408
Then come and get it.

1:16:40.417 --> 1:16:41.418
Die!

1:16:44.671 --> 1:16:46.256
Argh, I'm gonna get you.

1:16:48.091 --> 1:16:49.676
Watch them,

1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:51.678
or I will shoot you out the airlock next.

1:16:58.060 --> 1:17:00.062
Total flight control restored.

1:17:03.065 --> 1:17:06.235
Young Mickey is proving to be
as resourceful as a Pluvian Drap.

1:17:08.487 --> 1:17:10.447
Get that grubling an Expellerator.

1:17:17.454 --> 1:17:19.414
Yeah!

1:17:24.628 --> 1:17:25.629
Ugh!

1:17:27.548 --> 1:17:30.092
Stop making a mess!

1:17:30.717 --> 1:17:31.718
No. No.

1:17:44.439 --> 1:17:45.440
All right!

1:17:45.524 --> 1:17:46.775
That was awesome. Holy cow.

1:17:47.693 --> 1:17:49.027
- Oh, no.
- No, no.

1:17:49.111 --> 1:17:50.779
Gwen, get Arly out of the way.

1:17:50.863 --> 1:17:52.281
Come on. Quick.

1:17:53.532 --> 1:17:55.200
How do you tap into this thing?

1:17:57.995 --> 1:17:59.621
Art! What's happening?

1:17:59.705 --> 1:18:02.082
B'kr's blaster shattered the controls.

1:18:03.375 --> 1:18:04.376
What's happening?

1:18:04.459 --> 1:18:05.919
We're falling into a black hole.

1:18:13.385 --> 1:18:17.639
Roddie, you know you can't defeat me

1:18:17.723 --> 1:18:22.436
because I always win.

1:18:23.270 --> 1:18:26.899
This time, B'kr,
you don't stand a chance against me.

1:18:35.282 --> 1:18:38.327
I could do this all day,
but you're out of time.

1:18:39.661 --> 1:18:45.209
Soon the entire galaxy will be dropped

1:18:46.001 --> 1:18:51.381
in a constant loop, creating
and recreating my inevitable victory.

1:18:52.216 --> 1:18:56.470
And that time is now!

1:18:57.846 --> 1:18:59.598
Hey, Billy. Think fast!

1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:04.561
No!

1:19:06.104 --> 1:19:07.189
No!

1:19:07.272 --> 1:19:10.400
No! No! No!

1:19:10.484 --> 1:19:13.820
- No! No! No!
- You lose.

1:19:13.904 --> 1:19:16.073
No! No! No!

1:19:26.708 --> 1:19:28.043
- Rod.
- I'm okay.

1:19:29.044 --> 1:19:30.254
Where's B'kr?

1:19:30.337 --> 1:19:31.588
Let's just say I gave him a time-out.

1:19:32.381 --> 1:19:33.382
What are you doing?

1:19:33.465 --> 1:19:34.716
We lost main propulsion.

1:19:35.217 --> 1:19:38.971
You and Mom
have to get everybody off this ship now.

1:19:39.054 --> 1:19:41.181
- What?
- No. Art, no!

1:19:43.308 --> 1:19:45.060
I can buy you a minute, maybe two,

1:19:45.143 --> 1:19:46.645
but you have to go now.

1:19:46.728 --> 1:19:48.188
No. There's no way I'm leaving you.

1:19:48.272 --> 1:19:51.525
Art, I am not losing you all over again.

1:19:51.608 --> 1:19:52.818
No way, Uncle Art.

1:19:52.901 --> 1:19:54.361
We're with you, Commander Allbright.

1:19:56.029 --> 1:19:57.698
You don't all understand.

1:19:57.781 --> 1:20:00.826
If I take my hands off these controls...

1:20:01.410 --> 1:20:02.744
We won't last five seconds.

1:20:09.084 --> 1:20:10.711
We're all going home together.

1:20:17.593 --> 1:20:19.469
The Galactic Patrol is here.

1:20:26.018 --> 1:20:27.102
Everyone, get back.

1:20:27.477 --> 1:20:29.438
<i>It's too dangerous here.
Get back. Get back.</i>

1:20:29.521 --> 1:20:32.941
Ah-rit and Rod must stay at the controls
until the last possible second.

1:20:33.025 --> 1:20:35.527
We have to get
all the others out immediately.

1:20:35.611 --> 1:20:37.487
The teleporter can't handle the load.

1:20:37.821 --> 1:20:39.573
I am a Friskian Fighter.

1:20:39.656 --> 1:20:42.576
If a mission's not impossible,
I'm not interested.

1:20:47.789 --> 1:20:48.790
I'm staying with you.

1:20:52.211 --> 1:20:53.212
Art!

1:20:53.629 --> 1:20:56.173
No!

1:20:58.425 --> 1:20:59.426
It's okay, son.

1:20:59.968 --> 1:21:01.011
You're gonna make it.

1:21:05.390 --> 1:21:06.642
- No!
- Yes.

1:21:06.725 --> 1:21:07.809
- No!
- Still yes.

1:21:07.893 --> 1:21:08.894
- <i>No! No!</i>
- Let's get this joker

1:21:08.977 --> 1:21:10.020
back where he belongs.

1:21:10.103 --> 1:21:11.480
<i>No!</i>

1:21:11.563 --> 1:21:12.564
No!

1:21:15.025 --> 1:21:16.401
Two down, one to go.

1:21:23.492 --> 1:21:26.620
Did you ever finish that sci-fi movie
you started that night?

1:21:27.913 --> 1:21:29.998
Dad, I'm living it.

1:21:32.292 --> 1:21:34.545
You're a good man
to have by my side, deputy.

1:21:36.713 --> 1:21:37.839
I'm proud of you.

1:21:49.643 --> 1:21:52.688
Entry to portal.
Let's get ready to blast out of here.

1:21:57.568 --> 1:21:58.861
We're losing it.

1:21:58.944 --> 1:22:00.445
All right, on my mark.

1:22:00.529 --> 1:22:02.072
Put all the power to the thrusters.

1:22:03.031 --> 1:22:04.032
Captain Grakker,

1:22:04.116 --> 1:22:06.285
activate long-range teleporter
to get those two home.

1:22:06.368 --> 1:22:07.786
I can't get a lock.

1:22:07.870 --> 1:22:09.079
We did the right thing.

1:22:09.788 --> 1:22:10.998
We saved the galaxy.

1:22:11.707 --> 1:22:12.791
We saved our family.

1:22:15.377 --> 1:22:17.170
The black hole is pulling us down.

1:22:17.254 --> 1:22:19.798
We're out of time. Now, Phil. Now!

1:22:19.882 --> 1:22:22.217
No, no, no. You can't leave them.

1:22:23.385 --> 1:22:25.304
Engine failure in three seconds.

1:22:25.387 --> 1:22:28.307
Three, two, one.

1:22:28.390 --> 1:22:29.391
Here we go.

1:22:34.438 --> 1:22:37.149
I can't hold on any longer.
It's now or never.

1:22:50.037 --> 1:22:51.955
- Do you have them?
- No.

1:22:52.289 --> 1:22:53.290
We lost them.

1:22:58.629 --> 1:23:00.923
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I have them.

1:23:04.426 --> 1:23:05.427
Yeah!

1:23:05.510 --> 1:23:07.262
Daddy's back.

1:23:11.016 --> 1:23:12.684
Hey, come here, guys.

1:23:15.771 --> 1:23:19.274
I got out of this pickle once before
by being as cool as a cucumber,

1:23:19.358 --> 1:23:20.359
and I can do it again.

1:23:21.151 --> 1:23:23.320
Hold on to your seed-pods.
We're going in.

1:23:37.042 --> 1:23:39.086
Oh, my.

1:23:39.962 --> 1:23:40.963
Nailed it.

1:23:55.936 --> 1:23:57.104
Oh, no.

1:24:16.874 --> 1:24:19.668
My family, my friends,

1:24:20.335 --> 1:24:22.921
I thank each and every one of you
for never giving up hope.

1:24:23.463 --> 1:24:27.009
From now on,
no more alien adventures for me.

1:24:27.467 --> 1:24:28.594
I'm staying home.

1:24:29.386 --> 1:24:31.471
Like Aunt Petunia always said,

1:24:31.555 --> 1:24:33.891
"Home is where the heart of palm is."

1:24:35.350 --> 1:24:36.393
Cheers, everyone.

1:24:37.144 --> 1:24:38.896
- There you go.
- Cheers.

1:24:44.818 --> 1:24:46.612
Easy, Pong. Paper cuts.

1:24:48.071 --> 1:24:50.115
Whoa!

1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:54.161
Hey.

1:24:54.953 --> 1:24:56.997
- Hmm?
- Is that my homework?

1:24:59.875 --> 1:25:00.876
Uh...

1:25:01.460 --> 1:25:02.669
Classified!
