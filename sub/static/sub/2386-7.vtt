WEBVTT

00:00.663 --> 00:02.480
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2011,</i>

00:02.482 --> 00:04.532
<i>all of my friends</i>
<i>were in relationships.</i>

00:05.005 --> 00:06.738
So when Barney's brother James
<i>came to visit,</i>

00:06.740 --> 00:09.274
<i>it created</i>
<i>a slight logistical problem.</i>

00:11.110 --> 00:13.228
We're gonna need a bigger booth.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.080
I'm gonna go
to the loo.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.280
I don't actually
have to go,

00:16.283 --> 00:18.283
I just want a seat
all to myself.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.922
So, would anyone care
to ask me where

00:23.924 --> 00:25.624
Nora and I are
going tonight?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.092
Don't ask him.
It's a trap.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.595
- Where you going?
- Come on, man, for God's sake!

00:29.597 --> 00:31.964
Bootytown, Kevin!

00:31.966 --> 00:33.748
We are finally going
to Bootytown.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.934
And that's why
we don't ask him.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.971
I'm thinking I'm gonna hop on
the Long Thighland Expressway,

00:38.973 --> 00:41.857
stop off for a nibble
in Breastport,

00:41.859 --> 00:43.809
and then, with any luck,

00:43.811 --> 00:47.245
I'll be pulling into
the Pork Authority by midnight.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.615
Wait. You're <i>finally</i>
going to Bootytown?

00:49.617 --> 00:51.366
Look, we just don't want
to rush anything, okay?

00:51.368 --> 00:54.536
So we decided to wait
until she decides

00:54.538 --> 00:56.238
to let me have sex
with her.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.273
And that's
gonna be tonight!

00:58.275 --> 00:59.958
How do you
know for sure?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.994
Ah, something
she said earlier.

01:01.996 --> 01:04.629
Guess what, my sweet boy,

01:04.632 --> 01:07.949
I've got a special treat
for you tonight.

01:10.787 --> 01:12.620
Oh, yeah, you're going
to Bootytown.

01:12.622 --> 01:13.889
Hello again, my darlings.

01:14.891 --> 01:16.475
Barney, I hope you're ready
for tonight.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.126
Because you're gonna have
to use muscles

01:18.128 --> 01:19.344
you haven't used in years.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.762
I am?

01:20.764 --> 01:22.397
Yes.

01:22.399 --> 01:24.483
And I hope you have
some aspirin at home,

01:24.485 --> 01:26.485
because your arse is gonna be
killing you tomorrow.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.020
It is?

01:28.022 --> 01:28.854
Indeed.

01:28.856 --> 01:29.905
Because tonight...

01:29.907 --> 01:32.974
I'm strapping on this.

01:32.976 --> 01:34.409
We're going skating!

01:34.411 --> 01:36.361
The Pork Authority's
closed.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.979
Looks like it's Hand
Central Station

01:37.981 --> 01:39.147
for you, little buddy.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.834
So that's your special treat?

01:42.836 --> 01:44.202
Ice skating?

01:44.204 --> 01:45.871
Of course.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.823
And after that,
we're gonna shag.

01:47.825 --> 01:50.208
We're going ice skating,
everybody!

02:05.326 --> 02:07.460
Ask me what
I think of Nora.

02:07.462 --> 02:08.929
What do you think of Nora?

02:08.931 --> 02:10.096
Lovely girl.

02:10.098 --> 02:12.015
Ask me what
I really think of her.

02:12.017 --> 02:13.333
What do you really
think of her?

02:13.335 --> 02:15.135
Guys, she's great, seriously.

02:15.137 --> 02:16.770
Just drop it.

02:16.772 --> 02:18.054
Ask me one more time.

02:18.056 --> 02:19.556
What do you really think?

02:19.558 --> 02:21.191
Fine! If you really must know,

02:21.193 --> 02:23.276
I do not like Barney
with that woman!

02:23.278 --> 02:25.195
Happy?

02:25.197 --> 02:27.864
What could you possibly
not like about Nora?

02:27.866 --> 02:29.950
Her hair?
Her mousy little nose?

02:29.952 --> 02:32.202
The way she does
everything perfectly?

02:32.204 --> 02:34.154
I mean, what's not to like?

02:34.156 --> 02:37.908
It's not that I don't like her.
It's just...

02:37.910 --> 02:39.376
She's our mom.

02:39.378 --> 02:41.194
What do you mean,
she's your mom?

02:41.196 --> 02:44.798
Everything about her
is vaguely our mom-like.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.799
The British accent...

02:45.801 --> 02:47.334
Hello again, my darlings.

02:47.336 --> 02:49.219
<i>Mom's obsessed</i>
<i>with Julie Andrews,</i>

02:49.221 --> 02:50.670
<i>so when we were growing up...</i>

02:50.672 --> 02:53.423
Hello again, my darlings.

02:53.425 --> 02:54.424
- Come here, you.
- Hey.

02:54.426 --> 02:55.559
<i>And the way she hugs him.</i>

02:55.561 --> 02:57.561
<i>Left hand on the nape</i>
<i>of the neck,</i>

02:57.563 --> 02:59.763
<i>three gentle strokes on</i>
<i>the back with the right?</i>

02:59.765 --> 03:01.314
Come here, you.

03:01.316 --> 03:03.433
<i>Trademark Loretta Stinson.</i>

03:03.435 --> 03:04.901
<i>But here's the clincher...</i>

03:04.903 --> 03:06.186
Guess what, my sweet boy.

03:06.188 --> 03:08.071
Guess what
my sweet boy.

03:08.073 --> 03:10.890
I've got a special treat
for you tonight.

03:10.892 --> 03:14.411
I've got a special
treat for you tonight.

03:14.413 --> 03:15.612
Ice cream!

03:18.450 --> 03:20.116
They're coming.
Be cool.

03:20.118 --> 03:21.901
Forgot my raincoat.

03:21.903 --> 03:24.087
That makes one of us.

03:26.090 --> 03:27.591
Well, shall we?

03:27.593 --> 03:29.009
We shall.

03:33.431 --> 03:37.350
Ooh, don't wear out
that tongue, Barney.

03:38.269 --> 03:40.186
Don't wait up.

03:42.857 --> 03:45.442
I mean, sure, Barney has slept

03:45.444 --> 03:48.111
with plenty
of other people's mothers.

03:49.780 --> 03:51.197
But now he's gonna sleep
with ours?

03:51.199 --> 03:53.566
Psychologically speaking,
it's perfectly normal

03:53.568 --> 03:55.752
to wind up with someone
like your parents.

03:55.754 --> 03:59.105
Thanks to my mom, I'll probably
wind up with someone

03:59.107 --> 04:01.174
who loves my brother
more than me.

04:01.176 --> 04:02.442
Well, psychologically
speaking,

04:02.444 --> 04:03.860
I'm gonna go
throw up now.

04:03.862 --> 04:05.962
Oh...

04:05.964 --> 04:07.780
Ugh! This baby
is making it

04:07.782 --> 04:09.966
so I can't button
my pants anymore.

04:09.968 --> 04:12.085
Big whoop.
In 55 years,

04:12.087 --> 04:14.471
I don't think my dad
buttoned his pants even once.

04:14.473 --> 04:16.089
And somehow, despite
sweet talk like that,

04:16.091 --> 04:18.425
I don't feel sexy anymore.

04:18.427 --> 04:19.959
Are you kidding?

04:19.961 --> 04:22.479
I mean, you're-you're
even sexier now

04:22.481 --> 04:24.314
that you're rounding out.

04:24.316 --> 04:27.901
I mean, you're even
more sexy simply

04:27.903 --> 04:29.653
because there's so
much more of you.

04:31.156 --> 04:32.906
I'm never gonna get
in the mood while

04:32.908 --> 04:35.158
your mammoth Eriksen seed
is muffin-topping

04:35.160 --> 04:37.694
the bodiddly out of me.

04:37.696 --> 04:40.030
Are you saying,
"No erky-erky

04:40.032 --> 04:41.665
until this baby
pops out"?

04:41.667 --> 04:44.034
Okay, that's it.

04:44.036 --> 04:46.619
I-I am making it my mission
to help you feel sexy again.

04:46.621 --> 04:48.705
I don't care how much
more bloated you get.

04:48.707 --> 04:50.290
I'll get the
next round!

04:50.292 --> 04:52.208
Kevin!
Yay, Kevin, thank you!

04:52.210 --> 04:53.659
So, Ted, you're cool

04:53.661 --> 04:54.678
with Kevin, right?

04:54.680 --> 04:56.596
I know he's been
over a lot lately.

04:56.598 --> 04:59.665
Oh, yeah, yeah, Kevin's great.

04:59.667 --> 05:03.603
I mean, there was, like,
one weird thing the other day...

05:07.992 --> 05:09.592
He was just standing
there in his boxers?

05:09.594 --> 05:10.593
Yeah.

05:10.595 --> 05:12.195
I'll talk to him.

05:13.864 --> 05:15.031
Ted...

05:15.682 --> 05:18.284
be honest.

05:18.286 --> 05:19.953
You'd bang Lily, right?

05:21.005 --> 05:22.489
<i>So, later that night,</i>

05:22.491 --> 05:24.457
<i>Barney and Nora went skating.</i>

05:24.459 --> 05:26.826
Hey, kid, you know
how your mom won't

05:26.828 --> 05:29.045
let you have ice cream
till after dinner?

05:29.047 --> 05:32.332
But then the waiting
kind of makes it taste better?

05:32.334 --> 05:34.384
Well, I've been waiting
two months

05:34.386 --> 05:36.836
for that bowl
of ice cream.

05:36.838 --> 05:40.206
And tonight,
I'm gonna have sex with it.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.180
Look, Barney,
one foot!

05:47.182 --> 05:48.714
Oh!

05:48.716 --> 05:50.683
<i>Now, kids, for most guys,</i>

05:50.685 --> 05:53.903
<i>this would have meant</i>
<i>the end of the date.</i>

05:53.905 --> 05:57.574
<i>But your Uncle Barney</i>
<i>is not most guys.</i>

05:57.576 --> 05:59.559
I can turn this around.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.109
Well, I'm impressed
that you know

06:07.110 --> 06:08.243
a 24-hour dentist.

06:08.245 --> 06:09.661
Oh, yeah.

06:09.663 --> 06:11.246
He can also give you tattoos,

06:11.248 --> 06:13.331
do your taxes
and alter a suit.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.667
But I wouldn't trust him
with a suit 'cause...

06:17.788 --> 06:20.171
Speaking of drinking,
you want to...?

06:20.173 --> 06:21.423
No, Barney.

06:21.425 --> 06:22.907
Tonight's been
a disaster.

06:22.909 --> 06:25.176
I think we should just
call it a night.

06:25.178 --> 06:26.878
No! Come on, Nora,

06:26.880 --> 06:30.432
your tooth can't be that bad.
Let me see.

06:32.718 --> 06:36.104
W-Which is the fake one again?

06:37.757 --> 06:38.589
You look beautiful.

06:38.591 --> 06:40.591
Mmm.

06:40.593 --> 06:43.728
All right, maybe I could go
for one more drink.

06:43.730 --> 06:45.263
Great.

06:47.451 --> 06:48.817
It's funny.

06:48.819 --> 06:51.620
Sometimes the most
romantic moments

06:51.622 --> 06:53.371
can just creep up on you...

07:01.581 --> 07:05.133
I can turn this around.

07:05.135 --> 07:06.751
Hey, um,

07:06.753 --> 07:09.421
should've mentioned this before,
but, um, Ted and I prefer

07:09.423 --> 07:11.122
that our guests remain
fully clothed in

07:11.124 --> 07:13.458
the public areas
of the apartment.

07:13.460 --> 07:14.792
Been some complaints.

07:14.794 --> 07:16.761
Did Ted say something?

07:16.763 --> 07:18.063
Oh, th-there's been
some complaints.

07:18.065 --> 07:19.464
Not pointing any fingers
or anything,

07:19.466 --> 07:21.933
but let's just keep
those pants on, okay? Good talk.

07:21.935 --> 07:23.801
Well, if Ted said that,

07:23.803 --> 07:27.305
I've got something to complain
about, too: Ted's nuts.

07:27.307 --> 07:30.525
Okay, yes, Ted is a little
neurotic, but I wouldn't say...

07:30.527 --> 07:33.862
No, no, no, I mean Ted's <i>nuts.</i>

07:35.314 --> 07:36.865
Hi.

07:36.867 --> 07:39.701
Hey.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:51.714 --> 07:53.682
So what? It's his apartment.

07:53.684 --> 07:55.884
You're taking his side?

07:55.886 --> 07:57.635
Wait, this isn't
one of those classic

07:57.637 --> 07:59.337
"You still have feelings
for your ex-boyfriend,

07:59.339 --> 08:00.939
"who's oddly also your roommate,

08:00.941 --> 08:02.140
"which for the record
I'm totally cool with,

08:02.142 --> 08:03.841
"even though everybody
tells me I've walked

08:03.843 --> 08:05.443
into a bear trap" things, is it?

08:05.445 --> 08:07.729
No, I just, I feel bad.

08:07.731 --> 08:10.014
Ted's going through
some stuff right now.

08:11.183 --> 08:13.401
You eyeballing his deal
is the most action

08:13.403 --> 08:14.786
he's gotten in months.

08:14.788 --> 08:17.072
I'll be nice to him.

08:18.157 --> 08:20.408
So, I was trying
to think of how

08:20.410 --> 08:23.378
to best express
how sexy you are to me.

08:23.380 --> 08:24.996
A song? A poem?

08:24.998 --> 08:27.832
And then it hit me:
a board game!

08:27.834 --> 08:29.634
You just <i>get</i> women.

08:29.636 --> 08:31.035
No, no, no, you'll like this.

08:31.037 --> 08:34.556
We answer risqué questions
and perform spicy dares

08:34.558 --> 08:37.258
to slowly move up
your shapely legs.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.510
I call it Chutes and Lilies.

08:39.513 --> 08:41.513
I would've guessed Monopo-Lily.

08:41.515 --> 08:43.063
Yeah, that would've been better.

08:43.066 --> 08:44.048
Okay, game play.

08:44.049 --> 08:46.217
Roll the die to see
who goes first,

08:46.219 --> 08:49.237
forfeit a turn on a pass--
intended for two-to-six players.

08:49.239 --> 08:52.056
As Marshall explained the many
<i>rules of Chutes and Lilies,</i>

08:52.058 --> 08:54.909
<i>Lily thought back</i>
<i>to what Kevin said in the bar.</i>

08:54.911 --> 08:57.829
It's perfectly normal to wind up
with someone like your parents.

08:57.831 --> 09:00.448
<i>And then she thought of</i>
<i>the only other man she knew</i>

09:00.450 --> 09:02.317
<i>who loved board games</i>
<i>that much.</i>

09:02.319 --> 09:04.002
I brought Diseases!

09:04.004 --> 09:05.286
Marshgammon.

09:05.288 --> 09:06.871
Dog Fight Promoter!

09:06.873 --> 09:08.623
Lilial Pursuit.

09:12.128 --> 09:14.429
And that's how you play
the game.

09:14.431 --> 09:15.547
Oh, wait.

09:15.549 --> 09:17.465
I forgot to tell you
what happens

09:17.467 --> 09:19.634
if I land on "community chest."

09:19.636 --> 09:20.935
Honk-honk.

09:24.057 --> 09:25.423
I just want to go home,

09:25.425 --> 09:27.592
take a long bath
and go to bed.

09:27.594 --> 09:28.610
No!

09:28.612 --> 09:30.928
I mean, come on.

09:31.781 --> 09:33.615
My place is so much closer.

09:33.617 --> 09:35.233
I'll-I'll draw you a bath,

09:35.235 --> 09:38.769
pour you some champagne,
we can forget all about this.

09:38.771 --> 09:42.073
All right,
that sounds good.

09:46.496 --> 09:47.712
That bath was
wonderful.

09:47.714 --> 09:49.080
- Thank you.
- Of course.

09:49.082 --> 09:51.132
What do you say we go
out on the balcony,

09:51.134 --> 09:52.167
get some fresh air?

09:52.169 --> 09:54.135
Ooh, that sounds lovely.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.223
What a beautiful view.

09:58.225 --> 10:01.142
I couldn't agree more.

10:04.630 --> 10:06.731
Good-bye, cruel world!

10:06.733 --> 10:08.099
Oh, my God!

10:08.101 --> 10:10.235
I can turn this around.

10:10.237 --> 10:11.152
Shh.

10:11.154 --> 10:13.071
Ooh!

10:13.073 --> 10:15.990
Ooh! Date night.

10:15.992 --> 10:19.360
You know what? I'll just,
just watch this in my room.

10:19.362 --> 10:21.863
Already had dinner in there,
why not a movie?

10:21.865 --> 10:23.948
You should join us.

10:23.950 --> 10:26.217
Yeah, join us.

10:26.219 --> 10:28.536
No! No, no, no, no, no.
Three's a crowd.

10:28.538 --> 10:30.955
Besides, you guys wouldn't
want to watch this anyway.

10:30.957 --> 10:32.040
Try us.

10:32.042 --> 10:33.258
Well, have you seen <i>Die Hard?</i>

10:33.260 --> 10:34.926
Um, yes.

10:34.928 --> 10:36.327
Okay, the guy who played Argyle

10:36.329 --> 10:39.797
produced this documentary
about coin collecting.

10:41.717 --> 10:45.637
Now, I know my sexy
little lady can't resist

10:45.639 --> 10:48.223
a bubble bath,
especially one

10:48.225 --> 10:50.141
with rose petals.

10:50.143 --> 10:52.777
Oh, thanks, baby.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.633
How about a sensual backrub?

11:00.871 --> 11:02.019
Mm.

11:02.021 --> 11:03.288
- Oh.
- What's the matter, Lilypad?

11:03.290 --> 11:05.073
You love my backrubs.

11:05.075 --> 11:08.409
Ah. I-I do... very much.

11:08.411 --> 11:11.862
Good, because I got you
a brand-

11:11.864 --> 11:13.581
new...

11:13.583 --> 11:15.166
loofah!

11:19.972 --> 11:21.973
Oh, yeah!

11:21.975 --> 11:24.475
Rubs... oh, yeah!

11:24.477 --> 11:27.729
Trying to watch the coin
documentary over here.

11:27.731 --> 11:31.382
Hey, Ted, ever figure out who
you're taking to that concert?

11:31.384 --> 11:32.650
No.

11:32.652 --> 11:34.235
- You want to go?
- Sure.

11:34.237 --> 11:35.703
- Really?
- Awesome!

11:35.705 --> 11:36.938
It's a date!

11:36.940 --> 11:39.407
<i>Now, Kevin,</i>
<i>as a trained psychologist,</i>

11:39.409 --> 11:42.043
<i>knew the appropriate way</i>
<i>to voice his displeasure.</i>

11:42.045 --> 11:44.445
I think we need
to calmly discuss

11:44.447 --> 11:47.115
the relationship dynamics
at play here.

11:47.117 --> 11:49.617
I'm uncomfortable
with how close you two are

11:49.619 --> 11:53.121
as roommates, given your
particular romantic history.

11:53.123 --> 11:55.290
<i>Instead, he took</i>
<i>a different approach.</i>

11:55.292 --> 11:57.074
Aw, hell no!

11:57.076 --> 11:59.093
If you can go on a date
with my girlfriend,

11:59.095 --> 12:01.429
I don't have to wear pants
in your apartment!

12:02.264 --> 12:04.265
I can't wait till
this baby comes out

12:04.267 --> 12:06.351
so we can get started
on another one.

12:06.353 --> 12:08.136
Then again,

12:08.138 --> 12:09.470
why wait?
Ew, wait...

12:09.472 --> 12:10.921
Get off of me!

12:10.923 --> 12:11.889
Damn it!

12:11.891 --> 12:13.191
Ever since Kevin said

12:13.193 --> 12:15.326
it's normal to wind up
with your parents,

12:15.328 --> 12:18.062
I... I keep picturing yo
as my dad.

12:18.064 --> 12:21.265
Lily, that theory is crazy-town.

12:21.267 --> 12:22.200
How do you know?

12:22.202 --> 12:24.402
Because my mother is
six-foot-three,

12:24.404 --> 12:26.454
she buys her clothes
at the drugstore,

12:26.456 --> 12:29.123
and she prefers
to trap her own dinner.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.743
I love you more than anything,

12:31.745 --> 12:33.244
and you're nothing like her.

12:33.246 --> 12:35.330
Aw.

12:35.332 --> 12:37.799
Now, that's how
you turn a girl on.

12:37.801 --> 12:39.384
- Mm...
- Mm...

12:39.386 --> 12:42.303
<i>But then Marshall</i>
<i>really started thinking</i>

12:42.305 --> 12:44.055
<i>about Kevin's theory.</i>

12:45.457 --> 12:47.558
Midnight snack.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.344
Midnight snack.

12:49.346 --> 12:50.395
Mmm.

12:50.397 --> 12:53.181
Oh, yeah.

12:53.183 --> 12:57.402
Oh, yeah...!

12:58.237 --> 13:00.938
I am gonna rock...

13:00.940 --> 13:02.357
your...

13:02.359 --> 13:04.575
world.

13:07.363 --> 13:09.614
Yay.

13:09.616 --> 13:11.582
If it's any consolation,

13:11.584 --> 13:15.953
the, uh... the guy stole my
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> once.

13:15.955 --> 13:20.675
So... guess the world's kind
of a better place without...

13:20.677 --> 13:24.495
Oh, God, this
night's ruined.

13:24.497 --> 13:26.264
Oh, come here, you.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.720
Yes, it's been
a very tough night,

13:32.722 --> 13:35.773
but I still think
we can turn this around.

13:35.775 --> 13:37.392
Really?

13:37.394 --> 13:38.643
Why not?

13:38.645 --> 13:41.112
No sense in letting things
get us down.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.948
How does that song
go again?

13:43.950 --> 13:48.903
♪ Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens ♪

13:48.905 --> 13:52.824
♪ Bright copper kettles
and warm woolen mittens ♪

13:52.826 --> 13:57.528
♪ Brown paper packages tied up

14:23.940 --> 14:26.157
Mommy, no.

14:30.195 --> 14:33.423
I want to thank you,
baby, for reminding me of

14:33.424 --> 14:35.491
what a vivacious woman I am.

14:35.493 --> 14:36.492
Yeah.

14:36.494 --> 14:38.744
No, uh, no need really.

14:38.746 --> 14:41.764
Whoa, but I've been
such a naughty girl.

14:41.766 --> 14:44.517
Maybe I need a spanking.

14:44.519 --> 14:47.219
Great. We'll...

14:47.221 --> 14:50.156
we'll just skip
the board games

14:50.158 --> 14:55.277
and get right down to me
making love to you.

14:55.279 --> 14:57.446
Oh...

14:57.448 --> 14:58.781
Okay, good, 'cause

14:58.783 --> 15:04.286
I'm gonna ride you
like an unbroken stallion.

15:04.288 --> 15:07.006
Okay.

15:07.008 --> 15:09.675
Giddyup, cowgirl.

15:14.548 --> 15:16.132
No, I can't go
through with this!

15:16.134 --> 15:17.249
Thank God, me neither!

15:17.251 --> 15:18.417
You're too much
like my dad.

15:18.419 --> 15:19.885
You're too much
like <i>my</i> dad.

15:19.887 --> 15:22.054
Your dad?!

15:22.056 --> 15:25.090
Okay, dropping trou--
bad idea.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.776
We're moving on from that.

15:26.778 --> 15:28.444
This guy is a snake.

15:28.446 --> 15:30.146
What?! No.

15:30.148 --> 15:31.647
Ted? He's a nice guy.

15:31.649 --> 15:33.449
A really, really nice guy.

15:33.451 --> 15:35.701
You should be more like him.

15:35.703 --> 15:37.420
Mom, right on schedule.

15:37.422 --> 15:39.455
- What?
- Nothing.

15:39.457 --> 15:40.956
I'm just saying,
you think he's so fragile,

15:40.958 --> 15:42.875
and yet...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, fragile?

15:42.877 --> 15:43.993
You think I'm fragile?

15:43.995 --> 15:46.078
Yeah, fragile like a fox.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.296
First, he tries

15:47.298 --> 15:49.448
scaring me off
with his little peep show.

15:49.450 --> 15:50.883
Then he crashes our movie.

15:50.885 --> 15:54.303
Now, he's got tickets to
some super romantic concert.

15:54.305 --> 15:55.805
It's Weird Al Yankovic.

15:55.807 --> 15:59.625
Okay. But still, who's the first
person he asked to go with him?

15:59.627 --> 16:01.010
My girlfriend.

16:01.012 --> 16:02.628
Oh, man. Okay.

16:02.630 --> 16:05.130
You think I'm the first
person Ted asked?

16:06.267 --> 16:08.901
Ted, am I the first person
you asked?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.437
Marshall...!

16:11.439 --> 16:12.938
You, me, Weird Al.

16:12.940 --> 16:13.889
No thanks, Ted.

16:13.891 --> 16:14.990
Barney...!

16:14.992 --> 16:16.609
I got two tickets
to Weird Al Yan...

16:17.645 --> 16:18.694
Barney?

16:18.696 --> 16:20.579
Lily...!

16:20.581 --> 16:23.249
Come on! You'll be
the hottest girl there!

16:23.251 --> 16:25.201
Okay, you'll be
the only girl there.

16:25.837 --> 16:27.703
Stuart...!

16:27.705 --> 16:29.789
Claudia...!

16:29.791 --> 16:31.006
Brad...!

16:31.008 --> 16:33.175
Nat-alie...!

16:33.177 --> 16:35.344
Trudy...!

16:35.346 --> 16:37.296
Ranjit...!

16:37.298 --> 16:39.832
Carl the bartender...!

16:39.834 --> 16:42.518
Dude from my bodega...!

16:42.520 --> 16:45.104
Steam cleaning coupon guy...!

16:45.106 --> 16:47.206
Mom...!

16:47.208 --> 16:48.858
Please? I'll fly you out.

16:48.860 --> 16:50.860
I don't think so.

16:50.862 --> 16:52.177
I'm sorry, sweet pea.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.096
Is Clint there?

16:55.932 --> 16:57.533
No.

16:58.335 --> 17:00.903
Wow. You really
are pretty fragile.

17:00.905 --> 17:05.357
Look, I'm trying to explain
to you guys that I'm...

17:05.358 --> 17:07.877
Well, how do you
expect me to feel?!

17:07.878 --> 17:09.161
I mean, all I want

17:09.163 --> 17:11.997
is for someone to go
to a Weird Al concert with me,

17:11.999 --> 17:14.500
and I'm stuck going
with my roommate.

17:14.502 --> 17:17.136
Yeah, I might have to
rain-check you there, buddy.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.871
I'm not a Weird Al fan.

17:18.873 --> 17:21.223
He's just a rip-off
of Peculiar Jacques.

17:24.846 --> 17:27.213
Guess I'm going to
this concert alone.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.981
I'll be that weird guy.

17:28.983 --> 17:31.734
I mean, that
other weird guy.

17:31.736 --> 17:33.936
You know, there is one guy
you didn't ask yet.

17:33.938 --> 17:36.655
Someone who happens to be
the biggest Weird Al fan

17:36.657 --> 17:38.440
in the whole world.

17:38.442 --> 17:41.360
Kevin...?

17:41.362 --> 17:43.028
Ted...!

17:43.030 --> 17:46.064
Oh! Oh, you are gonna flip
when you see our tickets.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.616
They're in the shape
of an accordion.

17:47.618 --> 17:48.951
What?!

17:51.121 --> 17:54.173
So, uh, you
like Weird Al?

17:54.175 --> 17:55.708
Not in the slightest.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.048
No, dude, I'm the biggest
Weird Al fan.

18:03.050 --> 18:04.683
I know,
I'm agreeing with you.

18:04.685 --> 18:08.137
Do you know that I gave him the
idea for "Like a Surgeon." Yeah.

18:08.139 --> 18:10.723
Yeah. I wrote him a fan letter,
and then a few months later...

18:10.725 --> 18:13.158
Bam!
Top of the charts!

18:13.160 --> 18:15.110
You guys can eat it.

18:15.112 --> 18:17.696
Just... eat it.

18:17.698 --> 18:18.697
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:18.699 --> 18:20.199
How'd it go with Nora?

18:20.201 --> 18:21.483
Well, among other things,

18:21.485 --> 18:23.786
I realized
Nora's a lot like my mom.

18:23.788 --> 18:26.155
I'll bet that
ruined things, huh?

18:27.625 --> 18:30.876
Come on. Barney Stinson
always turns it around.

18:30.878 --> 18:32.444
- How?
- Simple.

18:32.446 --> 18:36.682
I turned...
it... around.

18:36.684 --> 18:39.284
Oh...
Uh-huh? Uh-huh?

18:39.286 --> 18:42.805
So the mom thing wasn't
a total deal breaker, huh?

18:42.807 --> 18:43.873
No!

18:43.875 --> 18:46.058
Guys, my mom is
the best person I know.

18:46.060 --> 18:50.479
If Nora's even the tiniest bit
like her, I'm a lucky guy.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.649
Hey, you know what?

18:53.651 --> 18:56.485
I'm a real lucky guy.

18:56.487 --> 18:58.687
'Cause I married my dad.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.189
Aw.

19:00.191 --> 19:04.326
So, uh, you want
to go get luckier?

19:06.713 --> 19:08.030
Bye, guys.

19:08.032 --> 19:09.665
See ya.

19:11.534 --> 19:13.085
So, what should
we do now?

19:13.087 --> 19:14.620
"We" should do nothing.

19:14.622 --> 19:17.957
You guys get out of here,
go watch your movie.

19:17.959 --> 19:19.375
I'm fine. Really.

19:19.377 --> 19:21.043
- You sure?
- Yeah.

19:21.045 --> 19:23.095
Thanks, buddy.

19:26.016 --> 19:29.101
Uh, hey... hey, Kevin.

19:29.103 --> 19:31.053
I think I'm a clone now.

19:34.557 --> 19:36.325
I'm sorry.

19:36.327 --> 19:37.943
Were you just quoting Weird Al?

19:37.945 --> 19:39.778
I was indeed.

19:39.780 --> 19:42.197
I'm a huge Weird Al fan.

19:42.199 --> 19:45.034
Well, then I need
to buy you a drink.

19:45.036 --> 19:47.286
I'll have a glass of champagne,
sweet pea.

19:47.288 --> 19:49.622
One glass of champa--

19:49.624 --> 19:50.906
Sweet pea?

19:50.908 --> 19:55.127
Sure. Meeting
a fellow Weird Al fan?

19:55.129 --> 19:57.296
That's cause
for celebration.

19:58.748 --> 20:01.917
Bottle of bubbly,
coming right up!
