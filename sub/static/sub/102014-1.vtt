00:08.341 --> 00:11.261
-[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:
-I just have to ask.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.513
When you were pretending to be with Betty,

00:13.596 --> 00:15.890
you didn't feel anything, did you?

00:15.974 --> 00:17.892
[Archie]
I can't stop thinking about you, Betty.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.020
I've tried, but it's impossible.

00:20.103 --> 00:23.398
I wanted to share something.
A song I wrote for you.

00:23.481 --> 00:26.943
Stop. Whatever this is, it's just over.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.989
Hey, Mom? I'm ready to get serious
about the Naval Academy.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.782
[Veronica] He's dying, Archie.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.784
And I don't know what to do.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.162
[Betty] What is this?

00:37.245 --> 00:40.206
[Jughead] Footage of our houses
being watched from across the street.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.042
For hours upon hours.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.962
-[FP] Maybe it's a prank.
-[Jughead] This is an escalation.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.213
It's a warning.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.425
Or a promise of violence to come.

00:50.508 --> 00:51.926
This was on our doorstep.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.554
-Maybe it's a copycat?
-[Jughead] I've seen this place before.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.015
[Jughead] Oh, my God.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.059
Are they stabbing Mr. Honey?

01:09.277 --> 01:10.945
Hey, did you reach out to Mr. Honey?

01:11.029 --> 01:13.323
We did. He's fine.
No one's tried to kill him.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.950
-Well, for now at least.
-In the meantime,

01:16.534 --> 01:19.788
-mind breaking this down for me?
-It's the auteur again.

01:19.871 --> 01:24.375
They've moved on from recreating a killing
to reenacting a metaphoric murder.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.920
Us and friends getting Mr. Honey fired.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.379
And there is one other thing:

01:28.463 --> 01:30.673
I wrote a story
called "Killing Mr. Honey,"

01:30.757 --> 01:33.676
within which was a fictionalized version
of this cabin.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.304
-I don't think that's a coincidence.
-All right. Uh...

01:37.096 --> 01:38.932
Who else knew about that story?

01:39.015 --> 01:41.184
-Just us. Me and Betty.
-Yeah.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.852
Unless I'm being watched or hacked.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.021
This is interesting.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.400
-[Charles] It's four ticket stubs.
-[Betty] For, like, the movie theater?

01:49.484 --> 01:51.319
Admission to watch the tapes?

01:51.402 --> 01:53.738
Stubs have the letters B and V on them.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.326
-What the hell? Like Betty and Veronica?
-No. Blue Velvet.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.078
Like Blue Velvet Video.

02:00.161 --> 02:03.039
The place that all roads
keep coming back to.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.000
That video store
and that crypt keeper, David.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.962
If he's not the auteur,
he's connected somehow.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.839
-Or at least a fan.
-We'll bring him in.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.217
I'll call you in the morning.
Get some rest.

02:15.093 --> 02:15.927
Okay. Good night.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.143
[door opens]

02:23.685 --> 02:25.145
Early morning run, Archiekins?

02:25.228 --> 02:27.272
Physical for the Naval Academy this week.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.691
I find it hard to believe
they wouldn't be impressed

02:29.774 --> 02:31.442
by my teenage Thor.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.736
You could always serve
your country in the USO.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.447
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, nothing.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.493
Just this new song you've written.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.580
-Oh.
-Mm-hm.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.458
That is... nothing.
Just something I'm kicking around.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.752
Play it for me?

02:51.129 --> 02:53.464
No. Ronnie. I stink.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.466
And so does this song. Trust me.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.430
Okay. I do like the idea
of you getting back into music though.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.933
Right now my focus is on impressing
the commandant.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.395
And you will. Because I'll be there
to make sure of it.

03:09.188 --> 03:11.190
[cell phone buzzes]

03:13.443 --> 03:15.945
It's Daddy.
He wants me home for breakfast.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.071
That's too bad.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.160
I was gonna ask you if you wanted
to join me in the shower.

03:41.512 --> 03:44.390
Hey. There you are. Come, sit. Join us.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.267
I have news.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.020
Please don't tell me
you and Mom are chaperoning prom.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.396
We are. But no.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.984
My news is, according to my doctor,
my core strength is building back up.

03:55.068 --> 03:59.239
In fact, my grip is almost as strong
as it was pre-diagnosis.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.532
-What are you saying?
-I'm beating it.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.536
-I'm beating this damn disease.
-That's incredible.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.206
It is, assuming it's true.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.334
Forgive me if I call your doctor

04:11.417 --> 04:13.878
to confirm that this isn't another one
of your stories.

04:13.962 --> 04:14.796
Fine.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.174
-[phone dialing]
-Does he know why you're bouncing back?

04:18.925 --> 04:22.303
I've been trying
this new workout regimen that's helping.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.389
[intense music playing]

04:26.474 --> 04:28.476
[siren wailing in distance]

04:33.815 --> 04:35.942
Thank you, doctor. TTFN.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.697
Well, it seems to be true.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.199
This calls for a celebration.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.035
Cheers.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.496
[all speak in Spanish]

04:49.706 --> 04:51.124
[inaudible dialogue]

04:51.207 --> 04:55.128
Ah. He's not talking.
Unless you count movie quotes.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.631
What did he say about his store's initials
on those tickets?

04:58.715 --> 05:01.384
-Never seen them before in his life.
-[scoffs] Right.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.929
I don't know if this creep is responsible
for making the videos,

05:05.013 --> 05:08.558
but I can't shake the feeling
that he is profiting off them.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.517
Same.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.730
-Where's your partner-in-crime?
-Following up on another lead.

05:13.813 --> 05:17.317
What exactly are you accusing me of,
young lady?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.777
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.989
If I made a videotape of you
and your classmates

05:23.072 --> 05:24.991
murdering poor Mr. Honey?

05:25.074 --> 05:27.160
Things haven't changed much, I see.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.288
-Mr. Weatherbee, you're back.
-Indeed.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.874
In time for senior prom and graduation.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.252
How--? How are you?

05:37.670 --> 05:40.465
I told Edgar I wasn't the mole.
He cut it off.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.551
I make it through most nights
without waking up screaming.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.935
Two businesses? Another besides
this community center?

05:53.019 --> 05:54.228
Yes, commandant.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.398
Archie is also the owner
of Andrews Construction,

05:57.482 --> 06:00.485
a business he inherited
after his father's passing.

06:01.694 --> 06:06.074
Well, I have to say,
I am truly impressed by you, Mr. Andrews.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.867
-Thank you.
-However,

06:07.950 --> 06:10.369
when it seemed like
you were no longer interested,

06:10.453 --> 06:12.747
I started looking at other candidates.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.583
Someone else you're considering?

06:15.666 --> 06:17.543
Yes, a young man from Queens,

06:17.627 --> 06:20.379
who's been training rigorously
for the Academy.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.465
He's also a boxer like I was.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.594
As you know, we have
a proud boxing tradition in the Navy.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.180
I'm looking for a champion.

06:29.263 --> 06:33.976
Crazy idea: If you're considering Archie
and someone else,

06:34.435 --> 06:36.354
how about deciding
with an exhibition bout?

06:36.437 --> 06:38.147
Right here at the El Royale.

06:38.898 --> 06:43.194
I do feel that Archie and this young man
are otherwise evenly matched.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.240
Okay. I'll have my office reach out
to KO Kelly,

06:47.323 --> 06:50.118
see how quickly
he can hop a train to Riverdale.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.995
Wait a minute.
KO Kelly is your other candidate?

06:53.079 --> 06:54.497
Yes, why? You know him?

06:54.580 --> 06:59.252
Um... Yes. He's only dating
one of my BFFs, Katy Keene.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.551
Well, Miss Bell was a bust.

07:07.051 --> 07:10.346
Charles isn't having much luck
with the video store's owner either.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.765
I do have an idea
of someone we could talk to

07:12.849 --> 07:14.642
who might be able to give us dirt.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.979
The only caveat being
he's tried to kill me.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.773
[school bell rings]

07:21.649 --> 07:24.318
Our momentous day is almost
upon us, Tee-Tee.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.406
Can I ask, why do you wanna be
prom queen so badly?

07:28.489 --> 07:30.366
"Want," Tee-Tee?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.161
Does Elizabeth want to be
the queen of England?

07:33.244 --> 07:36.247
A better question is,
why don't you wanna be prom queen?

07:36.330 --> 07:37.665
Listen.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.918
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.547
But the only royalty I care about
is being Serpent Queen.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.215
Which I will be. Again.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.760
-You'll see.
-Hey, Cheryl. Toni.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.305
Is this where I sign up
to run for prom person?

07:52.388 --> 07:54.807
Oh, no, Kev.
I don't think you wanna do that.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.225
No, I don't, actually.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.312
But Fangs has always wanted
to be prom king, so...

07:59.395 --> 08:01.647
-here we are.
-I hate to rain on Fangs's parade,

08:01.731 --> 08:04.108
but Toni and I are campaigning
to be co-queens,

08:04.192 --> 08:06.235
and it has been my destiny since birth.

08:06.319 --> 08:10.114
I have spent my entire life
fantasizing about being prom queen.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.492
A part of that is I exist in a world

08:12.575 --> 08:16.871
where everyone wants me to be prom queen
and certainly not themselves.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.332
Make sense?

08:20.541 --> 08:21.542
Yeah. Yeah.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.630
Thank you. As my friend,
I knew you'd understand.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.393
Whatever happens with your fight,

08:39.477 --> 08:42.647
I've booked us the presidential suite
at the Five Seasons for our...

08:43.314 --> 08:45.149
après-prom rendezvous.

08:45.233 --> 08:50.947
It'll be just you, me,
a bathtub full of rose petals, and...

08:51.030 --> 08:52.865
-[bell jingles]
-KO Kelly!

08:52.949 --> 08:54.492
Ronnie. [chuckles]

08:54.575 --> 08:55.993
-Hi.
-Hey.

08:56.786 --> 09:00.373
Welcome to Riverdale.
KO, this is Archie Andrews.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.583
-Archie, this is KO Kelly.
-Ah.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.669
So, you're my competition.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.089
No offense, but are we
in the same weight class?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.176
-I'm bigger than I look, bro.
-Boys, boys.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.303
Save the sparring for the ring.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.806
I promised Katy I'd show KO a good time.

09:16.889 --> 09:20.476
Yeah, I'm down. But first,
know where I can drop my stuff?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.771
As a matter of fact, I do.
Archie has graciously agreed

09:23.854 --> 09:26.857
to have you stay with him
and train at his gym.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.736
-I'm heading there now if you need a ride.
-All right. Play nice.

09:33.864 --> 09:37.535
[Bret] Well, well, well...
Never thought I'd see you two again.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.036
What brings you around?

09:39.120 --> 09:43.374
Look, Bret. We know you sold
your sex tapes to Blue Velvet Video.

09:43.457 --> 09:47.461
The owner, David, keeps coming up
in an investigation we're conducting,

09:47.545 --> 09:50.172
but he's not talking to us.
We need a way in.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.216
We need leverage.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.722
Yeah. I know David.
But if he's not talking, why should I?

09:58.806 --> 10:02.560
See, I have a friend in there with you.
His name is War Baby.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.564
Mm-hm. Know who he hates more than anyone?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.400
Preppies.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.237
What's the investigation?

10:16.741 --> 10:19.535
Someone is making videos of us
and our friends

10:19.619 --> 10:22.496
doing disturbing, violent things.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.249
We think this David is connected to them.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.502
Did he mention or host screenings
with the videos in stock?

10:28.586 --> 10:32.757
Some of David's customers prefer
shared experiences.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.428
Underground, immersive,
red-band screenings.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.847
If we wanted to attend one,
what would we do?

10:39.930 --> 10:41.098
Be on a list.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.059
Or you'd have to...

10:44.060 --> 10:46.937
prove to David that you're the real deal.

10:48.773 --> 10:49.857
Bring him a tape.

10:50.399 --> 10:53.319
Something to make him sit up
and take notice.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.154
Say, a snuff film.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.286
Holy moly.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.039
That guy's gotta have 50 pounds on you.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.374
Yeah, no joke.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.126
What am I gonna do, Mr. Keller?

11:09.210 --> 11:11.504
-He's gonna cream me tomorrow.
-Well...

11:11.587 --> 11:15.800
Honestly, a little psychological warfare
might be your best bet.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.470
You're smaller, but I bet you're stronger.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.724
Let's show him.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.104
-Got a mean left hook on you.
-Thanks.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.481
Been punching bags since I was a baby.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.819
I promised Ronnie
no betting on our actual match,

11:35.361 --> 11:37.696
but how about you and me make
a little side bet.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.990
That, pound for pound,
I'm stronger than you are.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.700
[intense music playing]

11:41.784 --> 11:43.869
-Unless you're too scared.
-[snickers]

11:44.954 --> 11:47.498
[Keller] Twenty. Twenty-one.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.333
Twenty-seven.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.877
Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.045
Ninety-one.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.297
Ninety-two.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.133
Ninety-three.

11:57.216 --> 12:01.554
One twenty-two, 123, 124.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.848
-One twenty-nine.
-[KO grunts]

12:04.390 --> 12:06.267
-One thirty.
-[groans]

12:06.934 --> 12:08.269
One thirty-one.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.839

12:36.922 --> 12:38.716

No. I won't help you.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.951

It's not an actual snuff film.

Okay. But I'll need a wig.

-Yes!

13:55.584 --> 13:59.964
Now, Reggie is going to kill you
