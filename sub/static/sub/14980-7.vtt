- And you’ve got me

- So you’re above that now?

12:46.058 --> 12:50.472
No. No, no. It’s just that you
squaring 015‘ with a master liar

Oh, and you think you’ll learn something?
A woman gets raped, she gets blinded,

Is that it?

his anger towardsJenkins.

36:06.373 --> 36:09.080
Yeah. Onset’s too fast.

36:09.168 --> 36:12.626
- What does that mean?
- Real anger starts
more slowly and then builds.

36:12.713 --> 36:15.125
Fake anger has
a morejagged onset.

36:15.215 --> 36:17.080
It comes in stages.

36:17.176 --> 36:21.089
And aﬁ‘er the fake angei;
adulation.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.761
Oh, my God.

36:24.350 --> 36:27.057
Husband’s a fan.

36:33.734 --> 36:35.850
[ Gillian ]
Do you know where Paul is?

36:35.944 --> 36:38.651
He, um— He checks on
his empty listings every night.

36:38.739 --> 36:40.730
He’s a real estate agent.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.029
Can we, uh—
Can we have those addresses?

36:45.120 --> 36:46.781
What’s going on?

36:49.708 --> 36:52.575
Paul Russell’s
not your husband’s
real name.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.797
It’s t eo C a/ter.
He changed it...

36:55.881 --> 36:58.088
six years ago,
before you met.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.336
I-I— I don’t understand.

37:00.427 --> 37:04.966
We found letters he wrote
to Andre w/enk/ns in prison.

37:05.057 --> 37:08.800
He wanted to tell him
how much he hated him,
how he hurt me.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.180
No. They were—
They were fan letters...

37:11.313 --> 37:15.727
from before
you two even met.
That’s not possible.

37:15.859 --> 37:18.020
Michelle, we really
don’t have the—
No.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.739
[ Gillian ]
He sought you out
to be close to jenkins.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.659
You know, to be close
to whatJenkins did to you.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.789
So, um—

37:32.876 --> 37:35.333
So all those nights
where he...

37:35.421 --> 37:38.037
told me that I should
talk about—

37:38.132 --> 37:40.748
about what happened,
that it would help me—

37:40.843 --> 37:44.051
you’re saying that he wa—
he was enjoying it?

37:47.015 --> 37:50.223
Michelle, you can help us
find Camille— in time.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.514
Yeah. Um,

37:53.605 --> 37:56.893
the listings are in the—
the drawer next to the desk.

38:00.696 --> 38:02.652
All right.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.074
All ri g ht.
Well, there’s
o ver 20 houses here.

38:07.161 --> 38:09.402
Have you got enough men
to get to all ofthem?

38:09.496 --> 38:12.283
We only have to find the one.
Now, Foster said
underground, right?

38:12.374 --> 38:14.205
That means that the place
would have a basement...

38:14.293 --> 38:16.625
and an attached garage
so that he could
drive right in.

38:16.712 --> 38:19.294
Houses shouldn ’t be
too close together.

38:19.381 --> 38:22.123
And he’d prefer a young,
busy neighborhood.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.833
The more going on,
the less people notice.

38:24.970 --> 38:28.258
[Taps Desk]
63 Meadow Lane,
McLean, Virginia. Let’s go.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.843
Go, go.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.912
[Hinges Creak]

39:11.975 --> 39:14.762
[Screaming]

39:16.563 --> 39:19.305
It’s all right.
You’re safe now
[Footsteps]

39:19.399 --> 39:21.435
[Screams]
Stop!

39:21.527 --> 39:23.609
Freeze!

39:28.033 --> 39:30.319
[Grunting]

39:32.496 --> 39:35.909
[Panting]

39:59.982 --> 40:02.473
Go home.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.479
You used me.

40:04.570 --> 40:07.027
You made it easy.

40:08.782 --> 40:11.569
How did you know
how to get toJenkins?

40:12.661 --> 40:15.368
In prison, the first time
I asked him...

40:15.455 --> 40:19.573
about the copycat,
he showed pride.

40:19.668 --> 40:22.580
Also just the faintest
hint of anger.

40:22.671 --> 40:25.003
So I knew he resented
his protégé.

40:26.550 --> 40:29.963
Right. The kind ofthing
only you would notice.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.169
Yeah, well, I’m trying to
teach you, love.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.098
You let me think
that Camille was dead.
Yeah.

40:37.185 --> 40:40.723
Yeah, I did. Couldn’t afford
anyone knowing that any part
ofthis was a con.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.767
Jenkins
would have read it.
Reynolds knew.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.849
Only about the photograph.

40:46.862 --> 40:49.194
Are you jealous, really?

40:53.869 --> 40:56.076
How long till we
break up for real?

40:56.163 --> 40:58.825
Eons

40:58.915 --> 41:00.906
You got loads to learn.

41:02.044 --> 41:04.376
[Door Opens]

41:11.094 --> 41:12.550
[Knocks]

41:12.679 --> 41:14.965
Hey.
Hey

41:17.184 --> 41:19.550
This is my assistant’s notion...

41:19.645 --> 41:21.556
of whimsy.

41:21.647 --> 41:22.853
Very cute.

41:24.149 --> 41:26.060
Yeah.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.688
Look. I just wanted
to say... thank you.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.398
Hell ofa job.

41:33.492 --> 41:36.199
There’s no universal
signal for gratitude.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.204
Surprises some people.

41:41.291 --> 41:44.454
Well, it’s a good thing
I can use my words.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.922
Your boss wants to
put me on a retainer.

41:50.425 --> 41:53.258
Well, even the government
has a good idea
once in a while.

41:53.345 --> 41:56.212
I make F.B.I. cases
my number one priority.

41:56.306 --> 41:58.262
In exchange,
they pay me handsomely...

41:58.350 --> 42:00.682
and give me full access
to federal resources.

42:00.769 --> 42:03.476
Well, good luck
with that.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.224
Including you.

42:08.777 --> 42:10.733
Excuse me?

42:10.821 --> 42:13.654
They want me to have a man
with a gun around full-time.

42:13.740 --> 42:16.948
[Chuckles]
To protect the valuables, huh?

42:18.912 --> 42:21.153
Guess I can’t blame ’em.
I mean,

42:21.248 --> 42:23.705
you guys are a bunch of
scientist nerds,

42:23.792 --> 42:26.158
running around
poking your nose
in people ’5 faces,

42:26.253 --> 42:28.164
calling ’em liars.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.086
But I am not a bodyguard.

42:30.173 --> 42:34.132
You know, I don’t have
anything like you...
in my toolbox.

42:35.303 --> 42:37.259
And you ’re something
that / clear/y need

42:37.347 --> 42:40.805
Without you,
we wouldn’t have found
Camille Halpern in time.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.393
Plus,

42:42.477 --> 42:45.139
Foster could have been
killed today.

42:45.230 --> 42:49.849
So, / said yes.
Yeah, well, I’m flattered,
but I’m saying no.

42:49.943 --> 42:52.525
Nah, you’re not flattered.

42:52.612 --> 42:54.694
You’re angry.

42:54.781 --> 42:57.272
But the decision ’5
been made...

42:57.367 --> 42:59.449
above your pay grade, 50—

43:01.663 --> 43:05.281
Hey. Hey. Look.

43:05.375 --> 43:09.709
Ifthis happens,
I work forthe F.B.I.
I don’t work for you.

43:09.796 --> 43:12.173
You actually believe that,
don’t you?

43:14.342 --> 43:16.549
Welcome to the Lightman Group.
