WEBVTT

00:07.400 --> 00:10.599
Ah! This is it, guys,
the big adventure begins!

00:18.518 --> 00:19.557
Hi, Hannah.

00:19.601 --> 00:20.760
Back in a sec.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.799
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:21.838 --> 00:23.317
Morning.

00:23.361 --> 00:24.840
You know, I do like her.

00:24.878 --> 00:27.477
- Really, Jay? You surprise me.
- Yes, surprise, surprise.

00:27.519 --> 00:29.078
Hey!

00:29.116 --> 00:30.715
How's it going?

00:30.758 --> 00:32.797
Hey.
All right?

00:32.835 --> 00:35.154
I hope you all got your beauty sleep
last night before the big trek.

00:35.198 --> 00:36.397
Well, I would have done

00:36.436 --> 00:38.835
if this one hadn't been on the phone
to his wife at 4am.

00:38.876 --> 00:43.115
David, I told you,
there's no Wi-Fi for the next three days.

00:43.155 --> 00:46.154
OK, gentlemen, are we ready
to get this show on the road?

00:46.194 --> 00:47.353
Yee-haw!

00:47.398 --> 00:48.797
- Yee-haw!
- Oh, God.

00:48.836 --> 00:50.795
Come on.

00:50.838 --> 00:52.077
CLICKS TONGUE

00:52.116 --> 00:54.075
Allez, allez! Allez, allez!

00:54.118 --> 00:55.157
Allez!

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.956 --> 01:09.955
You're looking good. You're a
natural!

01:09.994 --> 01:11.553
Er... I'm not sure!

01:11.596 --> 01:13.115
So, David...
Yeah.

01:13.154 --> 01:16.233
..how are you feeling as we head on
up into the rainforest?

01:16.273 --> 01:19.472
Well, mainly, a deep worry that
I've only been on this horse for an hour

01:19.513 --> 01:21.432
and my backside is killing me.

01:21.475 --> 01:22.714
LAUGHS

01:31.269 --> 01:35.028
Ah, well, that's Nathaniel. He's 12.

01:35.074 --> 01:38.073
And...and that's Maisie, who's ten.

01:38.109 --> 01:39.588
Oh, they're so cute!

01:39.632 --> 01:41.591
I love the name Maisie.
You're not jealous,

01:41.629 --> 01:43.628
are you, Jay?
LAUGHS

01:43.671 --> 01:46.910
THUNDER CRASHES

01:49.033 --> 01:53.552
I reckon that storm is coming in.
I think that we should all hit the hay.

01:53.590 --> 01:58.069
Um, are we going to be safe up here
in just our tents, Hannah?

01:58.107 --> 02:00.506
I hope so.

02:20.389 --> 02:21.828
Morning, Clarence.
Morning, Jack.

02:21.868 --> 02:23.027
Got your work cut out, I see.

02:23.069 --> 02:24.628
Fierce storm last night.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.906
Madeleine! How are you?

02:26.949 --> 02:30.228
Good.
So, you survived the elements?

02:30.268 --> 02:32.387
Yes, my first tropical storm.

02:32.425 --> 02:34.224
Horsing it down, it was.

02:34.268 --> 02:36.907
I was almost nostalgic
for the old homeland.

02:36.948 --> 02:40.947
They say you know it's summer in
Ireland when the rain gets warmer.

02:40.988 --> 02:43.707
So what time is your flight?

02:43.747 --> 02:46.426
Early evening. It will be nice to be
back home in my own apartment

02:46.464 --> 02:47.543
and see my friends.

02:47.587 --> 02:52.226
Well, we'll try and make your last
day on the island as pleasant as possible.

02:53.703 --> 02:55.142
GASPS

03:09.383 --> 03:10.662
Dead.

03:11.745 --> 03:12.824
Who is he?

03:12.863 --> 03:15.622
More to the point,

03:15.663 --> 03:18.502
how the hell did he get in here?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.099
...but he still showed up
at the christening,

03:55.138 --> 03:56.257
and Jamal was just...

03:56.300 --> 03:57.819
GASPS

03:57.857 --> 03:59.136
Oh, my goodness!

04:00.380 --> 04:01.979
What happened?

04:02.016 --> 04:03.775
We haven't a clue.

04:03.819 --> 04:07.258
The scene is exactly as we found it
when we unlocked the station.

04:07.299 --> 04:08.978
No wallet, no phone, nothing!

04:09.015 --> 04:10.414
We don't even know who he is yet.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.537
You mean he's a John Doe?

04:12.575 --> 04:14.534
SIGHS

04:14.577 --> 04:16.576
Do we have a cause of death, sir?

04:16.619 --> 04:18.618
Abrasions on the neck suggest

04:18.656 --> 04:21.454
some sort of cloth was used
to strangle him.

04:21.497 --> 04:23.376
Plus, you'll see these scratches
on his face and his hands,

04:23.418 --> 04:24.777
so probably a scuffle to begin with.

04:24.816 --> 04:25.935
But...

04:25.975 --> 04:28.574
If you're asking me how he got in
here, I have no idea.

04:28.614 --> 04:32.853
As far as I can tell,
the doors were bolted, shutters locked.

04:32.894 --> 04:35.653
All of which means the police
station is now a crime scene,

04:35.694 --> 04:39.533
and as such, will have to remain
sealed off until we've concluded the case.

04:39.574 --> 04:41.373
Where are we going to work?

04:41.416 --> 04:43.615
My place.

04:43.652 --> 04:45.211
Morning.

04:45.254 --> 04:47.853
Officer Hooper. Officer Patterson.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.695
The island search and rescue team
have been contacted

04:50.730 --> 04:54.369
by a local resident who's taken
some tourists trekking in the rainforest.

04:54.416 --> 04:55.655
One of the group has gone missing.

04:55.693 --> 04:56.972
They give you a description?

04:57.011 --> 05:00.050
Male. Aged 50. Dark hair.

05:00.092 --> 05:04.531
Wearing beige combat trousers
and a blue check shirt.

05:04.575 --> 05:06.774
His name is Adam Renshaw,

05:06.811 --> 05:09.890
and apparently he has a wife
and two children back in England.

05:09.932 --> 05:12.531
Where are they now, the group?
Still up in the rainforest?

05:12.573 --> 05:14.652
Yes. I have the co-ordinates.

05:17.769 --> 05:20.408
Fancy coming along?
Extra pair of hands wouldn't go amiss.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.969
Sure.

05:22.012 --> 05:24.411
Great. Photograph and process the
scene.

05:24.448 --> 05:28.287
See if there's any indication
of how our killer got that body

05:28.328 --> 05:31.327
into this police station,
and him or herself out again,

05:31.369 --> 05:33.288
without touching any of the locks.

05:35.532 --> 05:36.611
PHONE RINGS

05:36.650 --> 05:38.849
Answer that for me,
would you, Madeleine?

05:38.891 --> 05:41.090
DI Mooney's phone.

05:41.127 --> 05:42.926
It's someone called Siobhan.

05:42.971 --> 05:44.570
Ah! That's my daughter.

05:44.608 --> 05:46.327
Tell her I'm on a case
and I'll call her back later.

05:46.371 --> 05:50.770
OK. Sorry, your father is working
right now. He will call you later.

05:55.725 --> 05:56.724
OK. Bye.

05:56.768 --> 05:59.127
She wants you to call her back
when you can.

06:00.609 --> 06:02.128
You're lost, aren't you?

06:02.166 --> 06:04.445
Er, just taking the scenic route,

06:04.487 --> 06:05.726
as my father would've said.

06:07.088 --> 06:09.927
Must've changed the layout
of the tracks since I was last up here.

06:09.968 --> 06:11.567
Oh, well!

06:11.606 --> 06:13.365
OK...

06:13.408 --> 06:16.207
On the police station floor?
Are you serious?

06:16.243 --> 06:19.522
Yeah, and the evidence suggests
Mr Renshaw had been asphyxiated.

06:19.564 --> 06:21.403
What, you mean he was murdered?

06:21.445 --> 06:22.804
I'm afraid so, Miss Wilde.

06:24.366 --> 06:28.725
Can any of you think
why someone might do this to your friend?

06:28.764 --> 06:32.483
No! No, no, no.
Adam was a nice guy.

06:32.523 --> 06:35.922
I mean, he never even got upset
or angry with anyone.

06:35.964 --> 06:38.243
I mean, we don't even know anyone
here.

06:38.285 --> 06:40.204
When did you arrive?

06:40.242 --> 06:42.521
Er, three days ago.
We were staying at the Sea Cove Hotel.

06:42.562 --> 06:44.721
It's our joint 50ths, you
see.

06:44.764 --> 06:48.683
We always do something together
for the big birthdays.

06:48.723 --> 06:52.082
So, tell me,
how do you gents know each other?

06:52.124 --> 06:55.003
Ah, we've been friends since
university.

06:55.043 --> 06:57.082
That's where we met.

06:57.121 --> 06:59.720
And tell me, last night,
when was the last time you saw Adam?

06:59.762 --> 07:02.001
Um, about 9.30.

07:02.042 --> 07:06.201
The storm was coming in,
so, well, we all went to bed.

07:07.239 --> 07:09.198
And after that, anyone see him?

07:09.242 --> 07:13.761
Anyone leave their tent for...for
anything at any point?

07:13.799 --> 07:15.718
I went to see the horses at about
11.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.479
But they were spooked out by the
storm, so I gave them some food.

07:21.517 --> 07:24.116
I didn't see Adam.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.720
So, let me get this right.

07:28.762 --> 07:32.801
Adam went to bed at 9.30 last night.

07:32.841 --> 07:38.920
And this morning, when you all woke
up, he'd just...vanished.

07:56.798 --> 07:59.277
Adam's wallet and phone aren't here.

07:59.314 --> 08:01.433
So whoever killed him
must have taken them.

08:01.476 --> 08:02.835
Must have.

08:02.874 --> 08:03.993
Anything of interest?

08:04.037 --> 08:05.916
Yes. This.

08:05.954 --> 08:09.113
Was by his sleeping bag.

08:09.153 --> 08:11.352
Maybe he was drinking last night.

08:11.395 --> 08:12.474
And this.

08:14.675 --> 08:16.074
Video camera.

08:16.112 --> 08:18.431
Now, that might give us some insight
into what's been going on

08:18.475 --> 08:20.714
between Adam and his friends
over the last few days.

08:20.756 --> 08:22.955
You think one of them could be
responsible for what happened?

08:22.993 --> 08:25.712
30 years of history between these
fellas.

08:25.753 --> 08:30.512
Who knows what secrets and lies
are tucked away in their past?

08:30.550 --> 08:35.749
Yeah, but even if there is a motive,
why would one of them kill like that,

08:35.793 --> 08:38.312
leaving the body somehow
in the middle of the station?

08:38.355 --> 08:42.433
I know. I mean, was Adam killed here
and his body transported there?

08:42.472 --> 08:43.871
SIGHS

08:43.909 --> 08:46.309
Whoever did this certainly had the
means. CLICKS TONGUE

08:46.351 --> 08:50.190
Or maybe the murder happened
closer to the station.

08:50.230 --> 08:54.029
But still, why would Adam and his
killer leave the campsite

08:54.069 --> 08:55.628
in the middle of a storm?

08:56.710 --> 08:59.629
Well, whatever way you look at
it...makes no sense at all.

09:04.827 --> 09:07.826
Morning, Commissioner.
You're here about the body we found?

09:07.867 --> 09:10.146
A rum business indeed.

09:10.190 --> 09:11.709
I hear the victim was a visitor
to the island?

09:11.747 --> 09:14.306
Over with friends,
celebrating their 50th birthdays.

09:14.347 --> 09:17.786
The discovery of that body
on the station floor

09:17.828 --> 09:20.267
has created quite a stir
amongst the community.

09:20.308 --> 09:23.507
I therefore feel
the sooner we can reach a conclusion

09:23.548 --> 09:25.747
in this investigation, the better.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.269
Well, I understand your concern,
sir.

09:27.308 --> 09:29.587
To which end, I'm throwing
everything we have at the case.

09:29.629 --> 09:32.748
Including you, DS Dumas.
Hm?

09:32.789 --> 09:35.788
I've spoken to Paris, and they've
agreed to make you available to us

09:35.829 --> 09:38.468
until we've caught our killer.

09:38.506 --> 09:40.305
Of course. I understand.

09:41.545 --> 09:45.184
As time is of the essence,
I'll leave you to get on with your work.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.266
Thanks for sticking around.

09:48.306 --> 09:51.865
Well, I will need to make
a couple of calls to let people know,

09:51.905 --> 09:53.504
but...but it's fine.

09:53.547 --> 09:57.426
Great! Well, let's get started.

10:11.863 --> 10:14.062
JP...

10:14.105 --> 10:15.904
..come see this.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.023
Definitely wasn't there last night.

10:20.061 --> 10:22.100
So, what? You think the killer left
it?

10:22.143 --> 10:24.942
Perhaps it's meant
as some sort of message.

10:24.983 --> 10:27.622
You know how there's the death card
in tarot, isn't there?

10:27.664 --> 10:29.503
Which portends to death. So maybe...

10:29.542 --> 10:31.541
And what exactly does
the seven of diamonds portend?

10:31.582 --> 10:34.021
We must speak to a fortune-teller.

10:38.064 --> 10:40.383
OK. Let's wait for the Inspector
to come back.

10:40.420 --> 10:44.219
Until then, snap it, check it for
prints and bag it up.

10:44.259 --> 10:46.818
Who me?

10:46.859 --> 10:49.618
N-n-no, no.
No way am I touching that for anybody.

10:49.660 --> 10:50.819
Why not?

10:50.858 --> 10:55.177
Hello?! JP, I mean, the killer left
it.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.301
I'm telling you,

10:57.339 --> 11:01.778
this thing is emitting
some serious bad vibes.

11:01.822 --> 11:06.461
Ruby, it's a playing card.
It's not going to hurt you.

11:22.539 --> 11:24.978
OK, so, David.

11:25.014 --> 11:28.573
How are you feeling
now we're heading up into the rainforest?

11:28.615 --> 11:31.214
Well, mixed emotions, you
know, anticipation...

11:31.256 --> 11:34.055
Inspector, I'm ready when you are.
OK.

11:34.096 --> 11:35.575
..excitement...

11:35.614 --> 11:38.773
You know,
this place is far from being ideal.

11:38.813 --> 11:40.532
The Wi-Fi is intermittent.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.055
Your printer is out of date.

11:42.094 --> 11:45.853
And this wood...is very hard
to stick drawing pins into.

11:45.893 --> 11:47.732
So, what have we got?

11:47.775 --> 11:50.734
Our murder victim
is called Adam Renshaw.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.335
Turned 50 last month.

11:52.373 --> 11:57.372
No job that I can see. His wife,
Kathie, appears to be the primary earner.

11:57.415 --> 11:59.574
And we know
someone throttled Adam to death

11:59.611 --> 12:00.890
some time after 9.30 last night,

12:00.935 --> 12:04.854
then magically deposited his body
inside our locked police station.

12:04.894 --> 12:07.653
Suspect number one. Gerald Baynes.

12:07.695 --> 12:11.214
Teaches English
at Grove Lane Middle School in Kent.

12:11.253 --> 12:12.412
Married with two children.

12:12.452 --> 12:15.891
And according to this, he was
arrested for assault four years ago.

12:15.931 --> 12:17.690
Do we have any details?
Not yet. But I requested them.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.373
Then we have David Molyneux.

12:19.411 --> 12:21.170
Married, no children.

12:21.214 --> 12:23.413
Currently lives somewhere called...

12:23.451 --> 12:24.770
..Guilt Ford.
Guildford.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.091
Guilt Ford.

12:26.130 --> 12:27.689
No, it's Guildford.

12:27.733 --> 12:30.012
Guilt Ford.
Perfect.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.369
Bon.

12:31.412 --> 12:33.811
David Molyneux works as a manager
for a carpet manufacturer.

12:33.848 --> 12:37.047
Your initial check shows he's been
on sabbatical for the last three months.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.448
Mm-hm. I'll try to find out why.

12:39.490 --> 12:40.889
Good.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.527
And finally, we've got Jay Carver.

12:42.571 --> 12:44.370
Mm-hm.
Born and raised in California.

12:44.407 --> 12:46.686
Settled in the UK
after attending university there.

12:46.729 --> 12:50.248
Owns two restaurants
out in Oxfordshire - nice!

12:50.288 --> 12:52.487
Seems to be the only bachelor
of the group. Never been married.

12:52.530 --> 12:56.089
Which leaves us
with our last possible suspect -

12:56.130 --> 12:57.529
Hannah Wilde.

12:59.089 --> 13:03.768
She's worked all around the world,
always with animals.

13:03.807 --> 13:10.086
She arrived in Saint Marie in 2011
and opened a ranch and riding centre.

13:10.128 --> 13:12.407
Yeah,
but it's unlikely Miss Wilde developed

13:12.449 --> 13:15.888
enough of a motive to kill Adam in
just the 48 hours she's known him. True.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.688
Although, we can't wholly discount
her, either.

13:17.726 --> 13:21.405
So let's see if there's any
connection between the two of them.

13:21.445 --> 13:23.884
You're right.

13:23.925 --> 13:25.764
This wood is not at all welcoming
to drawing pins.

13:25.803 --> 13:27.082
Really?

13:27.127 --> 13:31.566
Now, Madeleine, might I suggest we
start with the victim's video camera?

13:31.604 --> 13:34.283
Something I want to show you.
OK.

13:35.763 --> 13:38.162
OK, this footage was shot three days
ago,

13:38.204 --> 13:40.003
just after they arrived.

13:40.046 --> 13:41.885
OK, this is the bit. Listen.

13:41.923 --> 13:44.482
Ads, I'm just going to nip
back to the room

13:44.525 --> 13:45.844
to phone the kids before they go to
bed.

13:45.883 --> 13:46.922
That's Gerald.

13:46.966 --> 13:48.925
Didn't you speak to them this
morning?And that's Adam.

13:48.963 --> 13:51.802
You do know you're spoiling
things for the rest of us, don't you?

13:51.842 --> 13:53.841
Sloping off and phoning
your bloody family every five minutes.

13:53.885 --> 13:55.444
You're such a joke. You know that?

13:55.483 --> 13:57.042
You know what?
I've just about had enough of this.

13:57.084 --> 13:59.443
If you don't stop
treating me like this, I'm going to...

13:59.480 --> 14:01.719
What? What are you going to
do?

14:01.764 --> 14:05.003
So have fun calling your kids!

14:05.043 --> 14:06.402
I thought they were friends?

14:06.440 --> 14:09.039
Except friends don't go round
threatening each other, do they?

14:14.762 --> 14:16.561
He could be like that.

14:16.599 --> 14:17.798
With me.

14:17.843 --> 14:20.602
It wasn't all the time, but, um...

14:20.639 --> 14:22.878
Yeah, Adam had this nasty side to
him.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.999
Were Jay and David aware of it?

14:25.041 --> 14:27.760
Only happened when Ads and I were
alone.

14:27.802 --> 14:31.201
He'd start criticising me
and making jibes, digs.

14:31.242 --> 14:33.201
And he's always been like this?

14:33.239 --> 14:35.078
Started a couple of years ago.

14:36.439 --> 14:38.918
Same time that his business
went into liquidation.

14:38.960 --> 14:43.399
Kathie, his wife, went back to work,
became the breadwinner.

14:43.438 --> 14:46.397
While Adam stayed at home
and looked after the kids.

14:46.438 --> 14:48.237
I don't think he liked it.

14:48.276 --> 14:52.155
I think it made him
feel...deficient as a husband.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.039
And so Mr Renshaw
started taking it out on you?

14:56.438 --> 14:57.597
HORSE WHINNIES

14:59.798 --> 15:01.837
You were threatening him in that
video.

15:01.875 --> 15:05.234
Said if he didn't stop, you'd, what,
try and hurt him?

15:05.274 --> 15:06.513
No!

15:07.995 --> 15:10.114
I don't know,
it was in the heat of the moment.

15:10.157 --> 15:11.596
I didn't mean it.

15:11.635 --> 15:13.074
Er, you do have previous, though.

15:13.118 --> 15:14.397
Sorry?

15:14.436 --> 15:16.475
You were arrested for assault.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.635
Not that long ago, either.

15:18.673 --> 15:20.352
Was that in the heat of the moment
as well?

15:22.034 --> 15:26.833
Gerald, I can imagine how Adam's
behaviour towards you, over two years,

15:26.877 --> 15:30.076
might fester, bubble away inside,

15:30.116 --> 15:32.955
until one day, it just...just
somehow gets the better of you.

15:32.992 --> 15:36.551
Look...he got under my skin that
day, I admit it,

15:36.595 --> 15:38.274
but not to the extent that I'd kill
him!

15:40.635 --> 15:42.474
I swear.

16:00.189 --> 16:02.588
I dusted the area surrounding the
body

16:02.631 --> 16:04.750
and found no prints
of any of our suspects,

16:04.792 --> 16:06.831
or even the victim.

16:06.869 --> 16:09.308
And Ruby, she checked
the bolts and locks.

16:09.350 --> 16:10.709
It was as we left it last night.

16:10.747 --> 16:13.946
And what about spare keys to the
station? You have some, right?

16:13.988 --> 16:15.547
In the safe. All accounted for.

16:15.589 --> 16:21.188
So the only way someone could've got
in here was to break in,

16:21.232 --> 16:22.511
which we know they didn't do,

16:22.549 --> 16:25.108
because there isn't a single sign
of any disturbance anywhere.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.349
Well, also, sir, we found this.

16:28.390 --> 16:31.029
You found the seven of diamonds?

16:31.066 --> 16:34.265
On DS Cassell's old desk,
slap bang in the centre.

16:34.306 --> 16:36.425
We think maybe the killer left it.

16:36.469 --> 16:38.348
Like in Batman, you mean?
I beg your pardon?

16:38.391 --> 16:40.710
You know, with The Joker,
he always leaves his calling card

16:40.747 --> 16:42.786
at the scene of a crime.
The Joker?

16:42.827 --> 16:44.626
The bad guy in Batman.
Do you have Batman in France?

16:44.665 --> 16:46.224
Of course, I know who Batman is.

16:46.268 --> 16:48.507
I assume in France
they call it something different.

16:48.543 --> 16:50.142
L'homme de la...
What is the French for bat?

16:50.186 --> 16:52.865
It's chauve-souris, but maybe
we should get back to the point now.

16:52.908 --> 16:54.587
My apologies. You were saying?

16:54.625 --> 16:56.904
I just think the more likely
explanation

16:56.947 --> 17:00.906
is that this playing card ended up
on the desk by accident.

17:00.945 --> 17:02.104
It's just a piece of rubbish.

17:02.143 --> 17:05.742
I'm not so sure, Madeleine. Feels
like too much of a coincidence to me.

17:05.787 --> 17:07.306
Have you dusted it for prints?

17:07.345 --> 17:10.824
We got some partials, sir,
but nothing we can use.

17:10.865 --> 17:14.263
Well, at least, let's find out
what shops on the island

17:14.305 --> 17:15.944
sell this brand of playing card.

17:15.981 --> 17:19.380
Right, well, let's call it a day.

17:19.422 --> 17:22.021
First thing tomorrow, JP, Ruby,
I want you going door to door in Honore,

17:22.061 --> 17:23.741
see if anyone saw anything
the night of the murder.

17:23.785 --> 17:25.824
You got it, sir.
Yes, sir.

17:25.861 --> 17:27.540
And Madeleine...
Yes?

17:27.584 --> 17:31.983
I reckon you and I should pay a
visit to the hotel they were all staying at,

17:32.022 --> 17:34.141
the victim and the suspects,

17:34.184 --> 17:37.343
see if the staff picked up on any
tensions before the trek.

17:37.383 --> 17:40.302
ONLINE DIALLING

17:42.579 --> 17:44.818
Hi, Dad.
Ah, Siobhan. There you are.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.622
Sorry I couldn't speak earlier.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.819
It's just been one of those days.

17:48.861 --> 17:50.460
Are you OK?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.262
You look...tired.

17:52.301 --> 17:54.500
Everything all right?

17:54.542 --> 17:56.621
Things aren't great, if I'm honest.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.977
Why? What's the matter? What's
happened?

18:00.418 --> 18:02.417
Me and Andy split up.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.819
Oh, no.

18:04.861 --> 18:06.500
Really?

18:06.539 --> 18:10.058
For good? I mean,
no chance of patching things up?

18:10.098 --> 18:11.137
Yeah.

18:12.420 --> 18:15.019
He's been...seeing someone else.

18:17.177 --> 18:19.096
Behind my back,
he's been seeing another girl.

18:20.536 --> 18:21.935
I am so sorry, Siobhan.

18:26.657 --> 18:29.016
Three months,
this Andy fella's been sneaking around,

18:29.058 --> 18:30.857
seeing the two of them at the same
time.

18:30.896 --> 18:34.135
That lad needs a good kick
in the hole, if you ask me.

18:34.175 --> 18:37.734
If a man ever went behind my back
like that...

18:37.775 --> 18:39.374
What would you do?

18:42.738 --> 18:45.617
It's probably better if I don't tell
you.

18:46.897 --> 18:50.096
I'm sorry for Siobhan, Jack.

18:50.136 --> 18:53.215
It's just the trouble is
I'm not good at this sort of thing.

18:55.493 --> 19:00.572
It was always her mother
who dealt with boyfriend issues.

19:00.615 --> 19:03.254
It's not that myself and Siobhan
aren't close. We are.

19:03.295 --> 19:05.374
It's just...
SIGHS

19:05.413 --> 19:08.532
I'm not sure
I know the right things to say to her.

19:16.415 --> 19:18.174

ELECTRIC CRACKLING

19:49.768 --> 19:52.927
What the hell is happening?

19:56.088 --> 19:58.367
So, I heard about Gerald Bayne's
arrest.

19:58.410 --> 19:59.449
And?

19:59.489 --> 20:00.648
It happened at his
school.

20:00.686 --> 20:04.685
The mother of one of his students
was being hassled by her ex, who was drunk,

20:04.731 --> 20:07.730
Gerald intervened,
ended up punching the guy.

20:10.766 --> 20:13.645
So his one act of violence in life
was to protect a defenceless woman?

20:13.686 --> 20:17.205
I know. We can't hold that against
him.

20:17.245 --> 20:18.924
I'm sorry.

20:18.970 --> 20:21.009
Not getting enough sleep there,
Madeleine?

20:21.045 --> 20:26.244
Well, since I've been here, there is
a cockerel outside of my bedroom window

20:26.287 --> 20:29.686
that wakes me up every morning at
4am.

20:29.726 --> 20:30.885
CHUCKLES

20:30.925 --> 20:34.324
Ah, yeah. There's a fair few of them
about, all right, yeah.

20:34.364 --> 20:38.603
I could see if there's a gun
and bullets in the evidence store.

20:38.643 --> 20:41.442
I'm more than happy to take
the little bugger out for you if you like.

20:41.483 --> 20:44.882
We're not there yet, but thank you.

20:44.924 --> 20:47.203
Come on. I'll speak to reception
and housekeeping

20:47.244 --> 20:48.403
if you take kitchen and restaurant.

20:48.442 --> 20:50.401
OK.
Good.

20:53.684 --> 20:57.283
You're late, Ruby.
We're supposed to be doing door to door.

20:57.325 --> 20:59.604
I know. I'm sorry.

20:59.645 --> 21:02.964
But it's all your fault
I'm not on time, JP.

21:03.005 --> 21:04.964
Not only has my washing machine
leaked everywhere,

21:05.002 --> 21:08.041
but it's caused all my electrics to
fuse, and I forgot my keys,

21:08.081 --> 21:09.080
so now I'm locked out.

21:09.121 --> 21:11.720
OK. So, why is it all my fault?

21:11.763 --> 21:14.242
Was it not you that made me touch
that playing card?

21:14.283 --> 21:15.562
Come on, Ruby.

21:15.601 --> 21:18.720
You don't seriously think that
touching the playing card has brought you bad luck?

21:18.761 --> 21:20.840
How else would you explain
this catastrophic morning?

21:23.524 --> 21:25.523
I've got the killer's curse, JP.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.599
SIGHS

21:30.643 --> 21:33.002
It's going to be a long day.

21:36.119 --> 21:38.918
Madeleine, I've got something.
Me too.

21:38.959 --> 21:41.118
You first.
OK. Thank you.

21:41.161 --> 21:43.000
So, the morning of the trek,

21:43.038 --> 21:46.117
one of the maids saw David Molyneux
pinning Adam Renshaw

21:46.158 --> 21:47.877
up against the wall
outside one of the rooms.

21:47.921 --> 21:49.080
It's just over here.
OK.

21:49.119 --> 21:51.318
The pair of them were having
a pretty big argument, apparently.

21:51.361 --> 21:53.160
Could she hear what it was about?
Yeah.

21:53.197 --> 21:54.876
The only thing she picked up on
was Adam saying,

21:54.920 --> 21:57.079
"It's been three months,
you need to tell her."

21:57.117 --> 21:59.876
I've been telling you and telling
you. When are you going to tell her?!

21:59.917 --> 22:01.556
Three months, David!

22:01.600 --> 22:03.279
Enough! It's none of your business,
OK?

22:03.317 --> 22:04.876
All right.
Just leave it.

22:08.079 --> 22:10.638
"It's been three months."
What was he referring to?

22:10.675 --> 22:13.034
I think I know what it is.

22:13.076 --> 22:14.675
David Molyneux's employer
just called me back.

22:14.714 --> 22:15.753
About the sabbatical

22:15.797 --> 22:17.356
he's been taking from work?
Absolutely.

22:17.395 --> 22:19.354
Of course!
That was three months, wasn't it?

22:19.396 --> 22:21.195
Yes. But it wasn't his choice
to take the time off.

22:21.234 --> 22:23.833
No?
No. He was suspended

22:23.875 --> 22:25.434
and also advised to seek
counselling.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.756
For what?
Anger issues.

22:27.794 --> 22:30.313
They said he'd become prone
to aggressive outbursts

22:30.355 --> 22:32.154
in the workplace.
Outbursts.

22:32.197 --> 22:34.596
David, when are you going to...?
It's none of your business.

22:34.633 --> 22:37.072
All right.
Just leave it.

22:40.714 --> 22:42.873
I've never really had anything like
this happen to me before.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.195
You know, problems up here.

22:46.434 --> 22:48.233
So, when did it all start?

22:48.272 --> 22:49.711
Oh, about a year ago.

22:49.754 --> 22:53.353
I just suddenly lost all my energy,
had no drive, you know?

22:53.395 --> 22:55.914
And instead of talking to someone,
I just got angry.

22:55.951 --> 22:57.830
So my bosses told me
to take some time off.

22:57.873 --> 22:59.392
And get some help?

22:59.430 --> 23:01.029
Yeah, yeah.

23:02.031 --> 23:03.550
Low testosterone, apparently.

23:03.594 --> 23:04.833
That's...

23:04.871 --> 23:07.310
That's why I'm feeling so down.

23:07.353 --> 23:11.352
It's not uncommon in men our age,
I'm told.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.870
Who would have known, eh?

23:12.909 --> 23:16.228
So, this row you had with Adam...

23:16.269 --> 23:18.268
Would I be right in thinking

23:18.310 --> 23:22.189
that you hadn't told your wife
about being suspended from work,

23:22.229 --> 23:23.508
or the therapy?

23:23.547 --> 23:29.066
Yeah, well...you know,
I worry that she'll think less of me.

23:29.110 --> 23:33.069
I imagine you wouldn't be too happy
if Adam was threatening to tell her himself.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.906
And that's why you got physical
with him.

23:34.950 --> 23:36.829
Yeah, but that was a one-off.

23:38.229 --> 23:39.388
Yeah, the thing is, David,

23:39.428 --> 23:42.427
I've a witness, saw you
pinning Adam Renshaw up against the wall.

23:42.468 --> 23:45.827
Now, how do we know that didn't
happen up in the jungle?

23:45.868 --> 23:49.467
Only that time, maybe you weren't
able to hold yourself back.

23:49.507 --> 23:51.546
Look, he was my friend, OK?

23:51.589 --> 23:54.228
We've known each other since we were
18.

23:54.264 --> 23:57.063
I mean, you really can't think
that I could've done this?

24:01.303 --> 24:04.942
I hate my life right now.

24:04.988 --> 24:07.987
The owner of the bar heard
we were doing door to door,

24:08.023 --> 24:09.902
so he came and tracked us down.

24:09.946 --> 24:14.185
He found a mobile phone and wallet
sitting on top of the rubbish in his bin.

24:14.224 --> 24:15.303
I checked.

24:15.347 --> 24:17.186
They both belong to Adam Renshaw.
Mm-hm.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.982
Any money that was in the wallet
has been taken.

24:19.027 --> 24:20.226
Also, there's something else.

24:20.265 --> 24:22.264
RUBY GROANS

24:28.781 --> 24:30.380
There. And there.

24:33.464 --> 24:35.623
Horse's hoofprints.

24:35.661 --> 24:37.300
But no horsey.

24:38.861 --> 24:40.900
So maybe one of our suspects
did ride into Honore

24:40.943 --> 24:42.262
with the body the night of the
murder.

24:42.301 --> 24:43.740
But why bring him all this way?

24:43.782 --> 24:46.221
And then, by some unknown means,

24:46.264 --> 24:49.183
gain entry into our police station
and dump his body on the floor?

24:49.220 --> 24:52.499
Hey, you guys!
I think I found something in here!

24:52.539 --> 24:54.938
Do you think you can reach it?

24:54.981 --> 24:57.860
I think so. Guys, don't worry.

24:57.901 --> 25:00.220
Nearly got it.

25:01.461 --> 25:03.100
SCREAMS

25:07.022 --> 25:08.941
Did wonder if that might happen.

25:13.457 --> 25:16.816
So, you still don't think

25:16.857 --> 25:20.216
I've got a curse hanging over me?

25:22.379 --> 25:24.978
Adam was definitely wearing
this neckerchief the day of the trek.

25:25.018 --> 25:26.217
It was on the camcorder footage.

25:26.257 --> 25:28.096
OK, so, David, how are you feeling?

25:28.140 --> 25:31.139
Maybe this was used to strangle him?

25:31.180 --> 25:33.139
Oh, well, let's get it checked
for prints and DNA.

25:33.177 --> 25:34.456
The wallet and phone, too.

25:34.500 --> 25:35.979
OK.
Well...

25:36.018 --> 25:38.817
Looks like you may have found us
our murder weapon, Ruby.

25:38.858 --> 25:42.017
So it wasn't for nothing,
you going into the bin. Fair play to you.

25:42.058 --> 25:44.937
Now, I need you both to follow the
road back to the station.

25:44.979 --> 25:47.058
See if you can find any more
hoofprints between here and there.

25:47.095 --> 25:48.374
Yes, Inspector Mooney.

25:48.418 --> 25:50.777
Get it off me!
All right, all right.

25:59.216 --> 26:01.135
Argh!

26:01.173 --> 26:02.612
Ce bois!

26:03.614 --> 26:04.933
Well, I'll be jiggered.

26:04.972 --> 26:06.411
You have something, Inspector?

26:06.455 --> 26:07.654
Postmortem's through,

26:07.694 --> 26:10.173
and the cause of death
was not asphyxiation.

26:10.214 --> 26:11.253
Huh.

26:11.292 --> 26:12.611
It was a stroke that killed him,

26:12.655 --> 26:14.334
brought on by him being strangled.

26:15.211 --> 26:17.050
The medical file indicates

26:17.093 --> 26:20.092
that Mr Renshaw
suffered from coronary artery disease.

26:20.135 --> 26:21.814
The blood vessels in his neck

26:21.852 --> 26:23.931
were lined
with hard plaques of cholesterol.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.132
The strangulation caused
one of these plaques to rupture,

26:26.175 --> 26:28.894
which went to his brain
and induced a fatal stroke.

26:28.930 --> 26:31.009
But they're still saying it's
murder, right?

26:31.052 --> 26:34.051
Absolutely. The pathologist said
whoever strangled Mr Renshaw

26:34.092 --> 26:35.651
clearly meant to kill him.

26:35.689 --> 26:37.528
Here. Made you a brew.

26:37.572 --> 26:44.331
This also confirms there were
significant levels of alcohol in his blood.

26:44.372 --> 26:46.731
You were right about him knocking
back the booze we found up at the tent.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.132
Any luck with the victim's phone?

26:49.169 --> 26:50.448
Yes.

26:50.492 --> 26:52.451
The only call he received

26:52.488 --> 26:57.207
while he was on the island
was at 8am on the morning of the trek.

26:57.252 --> 27:01.091
The number is registered
to a law firm in the UK.

27:01.131 --> 27:03.170
Left a message for them to call me
back.

27:03.206 --> 27:05.805
Also, I've been through
immigration files online,

27:05.848 --> 27:08.407
to see if there's any connection
between Hannah Wilde and the victim.

27:08.449 --> 27:12.448
There's nothing as far as I can
tell. Look, I'll show you.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.289
Your lizard is in the way.

27:17.331 --> 27:20.370
Give it a minute,
he'll get bored and disappear.

27:20.405 --> 27:23.844
Not one for the intricacies
of a murder investigation, are you?

27:25.288 --> 27:27.247
This place is so frustrating!

27:28.529 --> 27:30.928
Sorry I can't do any better.
No...

27:30.969 --> 27:32.328
It's me.

27:32.368 --> 27:34.087
SIGHS

27:34.125 --> 27:37.124
I am just feeling very tired. I'm
sorry.

27:37.165 --> 27:40.884
To cheer you up,
I've made something of a breakthrough.

27:42.406 --> 27:43.725
Really, what is it?

27:43.763 --> 27:46.882
There's only one shop on the island
that sells this brand of playing card.

27:46.925 --> 27:48.164
I'm going to ask Ruby to check it
out.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.247
Ah, there you are.

27:50.284 --> 27:52.043
How'd you get on?
Not a single hoofprint

27:52.086 --> 27:55.085
between the bar and the station,
Inspector.

28:00.403 --> 28:03.202
WHISPERS:Officer Patterson. You
smell.

28:03.244 --> 28:04.403
I know!

28:07.723 --> 28:10.962
Tomorrow, we start to dig deeper.

28:11.002 --> 28:15.601
Our three main suspects met
at university in 1987.

28:15.644 --> 28:17.843
30 years
these chaps have known each other.

28:17.881 --> 28:20.880
So, why did one of them feel the
need to kill Adam Renshaw now?

28:32.559 --> 28:34.918
You sure it's OK,
just dropping you here?

28:34.960 --> 28:36.039
Yeah.

28:36.078 --> 28:38.237
I'll just have dinner,
then straight to my room

28:38.280 --> 28:39.759
and get an early night.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.919
Madeleine.

28:48.159 --> 28:52.038
You know, this island,
it sort of plays by its own rules.

28:52.078 --> 28:55.717
And the best thing to do, I've
found, is just give in to it.

28:55.758 --> 28:58.877
So, if that rooster wakes you again
at some ungodly hour of the morning,

28:58.918 --> 29:02.197
just go down to the beach,
sit on the sand, take a deep breath,

29:02.238 --> 29:05.557
and enjoy watching the sun come up.

29:05.597 --> 29:08.236
Trust me, you'll feel a lot better
for it.

29:08.278 --> 29:09.797
Well, maybe I will try.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.679
Thank you.

29:16.636 --> 29:20.595
Just checking in on my little girl,
see how she's bearing up.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.073
I'm doing OK. I guess.

29:24.678 --> 29:28.517
I was thinking, if you want me to
speak to some of my old chums in the Met,

29:28.557 --> 29:29.996
get 'em to pay this Andy fella a
visit,

29:30.035 --> 29:31.354
put the wind up him,

29:31.398 --> 29:33.197
it'd only take a quick phone call.

29:33.235 --> 29:34.954
You don't need to do that.

29:38.516 --> 29:39.915
Things still aren't great, are they?

29:41.995 --> 29:45.794
I think...I'm missing Mum.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.232
I thought I'd got used to it,

29:49.275 --> 29:50.874
her not being around, but...

29:52.116 --> 29:54.515
..it's like it's crept up on me
again.

29:55.555 --> 29:56.754
And I...

29:57.911 --> 30:00.790
..I just really wish she was here.

30:17.830 --> 30:21.309
And you're absolutely positive
that none of these four people

30:21.350 --> 30:22.909
bought one of these decks of playing
cards from you?

30:22.953 --> 30:24.592
I'm positive.

30:24.631 --> 30:26.990
SIGHS

30:29.872 --> 30:36.511
ENGINE SPUTTERS

30:36.552 --> 30:37.991
Oh!

30:38.030 --> 30:40.229
ENGINE SPUTTERS

30:44.669 --> 30:46.068
Why are you doing this to me?!

31:19.066 --> 31:21.665
PHONE RINGS

31:29.065 --> 31:30.184
We've done some digging

31:30.224 --> 31:32.783
into our victim and suspects' time
together at university.

31:32.825 --> 31:34.064
OK.

31:34.102 --> 31:36.861
This is the website
for the alumni society.

31:36.904 --> 31:39.303
And when we checked the pages
for the year our suspects graduated,

31:39.344 --> 31:40.983
we came across this photo.

31:41.022 --> 31:42.781
"Weren't they cute together?

31:42.823 --> 31:45.462
"Kathie Hastings and Jay Carver."

31:45.506 --> 31:48.265
The same Kathie Adam married?
Mm-hm.

31:48.300 --> 31:51.099
So Jay and Kathie were an item
before she hooked up with Adam.

31:51.141 --> 31:55.140
And apparently,
Jay has never managed to move on.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.979
We've tracked one of the students
from the year.

31:57.022 --> 31:58.741
His name is Martin Lister.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.743
He's a very active member
in the alumni society.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.379
I'll put him on speakerphone.

32:02.425 --> 32:04.504
Mr Lister, DI Mooney here.

32:04.541 --> 32:07.740
So, what's the story? You think
Jay still has the hots for Kathie?

32:07.780 --> 32:09.419
Well, he as good as said as much to
me.

32:09.463 --> 32:11.422
Really? When? What did he say?

32:11.460 --> 32:13.659
There was a reunion dance
six months ago.

32:13.701 --> 32:15.060
We were both a bit drunk.

32:15.098 --> 32:16.817
Jay was watching
Adam and Kathie dancing,

32:16.861 --> 32:18.940
and he started bad-mouthing Adam.

32:18.978 --> 32:20.337
But the thing I remember most, he
said,

32:20.381 --> 32:21.900
"At least
Adam won't be around much longer.

32:21.939 --> 32:25.138
"Then Kathie'll come to her senses.
You'll see."

32:25.179 --> 32:28.258
"Adam won't be around much longer.
You'll see."

32:29.417 --> 32:30.896
He didn't mean he was going to...?

32:30.940 --> 32:33.019
Kill him?

32:33.055 --> 32:36.614
Look, I know how that might sound,
especially in light of what happened,

32:36.662 --> 32:41.381
but what I meant was
Adam and Kathie were getting divorced.

32:41.419 --> 32:44.738
She told me a week before the
reunion, and that's why I said what I said.

32:44.778 --> 32:47.017
And do you know
why they were going their separate ways?

32:47.059 --> 32:49.378
It was Kathie's decision.

32:49.416 --> 32:51.655
She felt that Adam had changed
last couple of years.

32:51.698 --> 32:53.697
Since he lost his job, you mean?

32:53.739 --> 32:54.818
Yeah.

32:54.858 --> 32:59.617
On the surface, Adam seemed
like a nice, sorted, family guy.

32:59.655 --> 33:01.374
But...

33:01.417 --> 33:04.216
With a few insecurities underneath
it all?

33:04.258 --> 33:05.537
From what Kathie tells me.

33:08.456 --> 33:09.735
What about you?

33:09.774 --> 33:11.453
What about me?

33:11.498 --> 33:13.977
Well, you never settled down
yourself, have you, Mr Carver?

33:14.013 --> 33:16.612
So? That is my life choice to make.

33:16.654 --> 33:19.453
Yeah, but sometimes
there's something else going on.

33:19.494 --> 33:20.733
Yeah.

33:20.772 --> 33:22.491
A subtext to making a decision like
that.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.733
Especially if the person making it
believes

33:24.776 --> 33:26.375
they've already met
the love of their life.

33:26.412 --> 33:27.971
SCOFFS
Oh!

33:29.055 --> 33:31.014
You still love Kathie, don't you?

33:34.331 --> 33:35.530
Yeah.

33:38.774 --> 33:42.013
I guess there are some things in
life you can't turn off.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.413
Although, all that changes now.

33:44.451 --> 33:48.130
You could still get the girl
after all, Jay.

33:48.170 --> 33:50.529
Quite a motive, unrequited love.

33:50.572 --> 33:53.971
Except...it isn't a motive.

33:54.011 --> 33:56.010
Cos they were getting divorced,

33:56.053 --> 33:59.852
so I wouldn't need to kill Adam
to be with Kathie.

34:01.768 --> 34:03.247
She'd already left him.

34:06.811 --> 34:10.050
Thanks for talking to me,
Kathie. I appreciate it.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.250
What did she say?

34:11.290 --> 34:13.089
Jay's been telling the truth.

34:13.130 --> 34:16.330
Adam had moved into a bedsit
around the corner from the family home.

34:16.371 --> 34:17.370
Mm-hm.

34:17.409 --> 34:19.569
That phone call the morning of the
trek,

34:19.612 --> 34:21.210
that was from Adam's solicitor,
informing him

34:21.248 --> 34:24.047
that Kathie was applying
for full custody of the kids.

34:24.090 --> 34:26.168
And with him having
no proper job to speak of,

34:26.206 --> 34:27.284
or even a proper home,

34:27.329 --> 34:29.328
well, she was likely to get it.

34:29.366 --> 34:33.205
Hm. That's why he drank half the
bottle of rum the night of the murder.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.204
PHONE RINGS
He was drowning his sorrows.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.446
Yes.
JP, what have you got?

34:36.485 --> 34:39.164
The lab have been in touch,
and they've got something.

34:39.206 --> 34:40.324
Go on.

34:40.369 --> 34:42.007
Those scratches on the victim's
arms.

34:42.047 --> 34:44.886
They found residue
of some sort of oil in the cuts.

34:44.927 --> 34:47.206
It took a lot of testing,
but now they know.

34:47.248 --> 34:49.407
It's linseed oil.

34:49.445 --> 34:52.004
Linseed oil. I mean, I've heard of
it. What's it used for again?

34:52.045 --> 34:55.123
It's commonly used
as a supplement for horses.

34:55.167 --> 34:56.485
It adds fat to their diet.

34:56.524 --> 34:59.803
I went to see the horses at about
11. I gave them some food.

35:07.767 --> 35:11.006
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.201
HANNAH CLICKS TONGUE

35:17.083 --> 35:18.682
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

35:21.041 --> 35:23.560
This one's been jumpy ever since we
got back from the trek. I...

35:25.004 --> 35:26.603
I think he knows something's not
right.

35:28.725 --> 35:30.564
You'll admit you haven't been
entirely honest with us?

35:34.520 --> 35:36.119
That night in the rainforest...

35:38.279 --> 35:41.158
...I didn't lie to you
when I said I went to settle the horses.

35:41.200 --> 35:44.479
But what happened after...

35:46.322 --> 35:49.681
When I got back to the tent,
Adam was there.

35:49.722 --> 35:52.841
Waiting. He was drunk.

35:52.882 --> 35:54.401
Hannah, Hannah...

35:54.440 --> 35:56.479
Do you have any booze?
I don't have any.

35:56.521 --> 35:59.160
You must have some.
Adam, really!

36:04.519 --> 36:06.438
He, um...

36:06.481 --> 36:10.480
The next thing I know,
he's trying to force himself onto me.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.199
He pushed me to the ground and I...

36:14.958 --> 36:16.957
..I tried to fight him off.

36:16.999 --> 36:19.398
I screamed at him to leave me alone.

36:19.435 --> 36:20.674
SCREAMS

36:31.636 --> 36:33.635
And then what?

36:33.678 --> 36:34.957
He just stopped.

36:37.638 --> 36:40.197
I think Adam realised what he'd
done.

36:40.234 --> 36:41.873
He felt ashamed.

36:42.915 --> 36:45.234
So I pulled myself back in the tent,

36:45.276 --> 36:48.475
I zipped it up, and that is the last
time that I saw him.

36:48.516 --> 36:52.915
Miss Wilde, why haven't you told us
any of this before?

36:52.954 --> 36:55.953
Because I'd already chosen
to lie about it.

36:55.995 --> 37:01.234
I was scared of what you'd think,
how it would look.

37:01.276 --> 37:04.635
A man is killed the same night
that he attacks me.

37:04.675 --> 37:08.994
It gives you a hell of a reason
to think I did it, doesn't it?

37:09.034 --> 37:11.033
Except I didn't.

37:12.274 --> 37:15.473
Adam Renshaw was still alive
when I closed my tent that night.

37:19.553 --> 37:22.792
Thank you very much. OK, bye-bye.

37:22.833 --> 37:25.832
Sir, that was the lab.

37:25.873 --> 37:29.072
The fibres on the victim match
with the cloth we found in the bin.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.113
So it was used to strangle Mr
Renshaw.

37:31.149 --> 37:34.508
But there's no DNA or fingerprints
on the cloth itself.

37:34.550 --> 37:37.469
BEEPING
Well, what about the wallet and phone?

37:37.509 --> 37:39.628
Same.
What is that noise?

37:43.270 --> 37:45.549
BEEPING

37:59.226 --> 38:00.905
So, I guess I kind of broke the
bike.

38:00.948 --> 38:03.907
You're saying the bike broke down,
not because of some mechanical fault,

38:03.949 --> 38:05.428
but because of something you did?

38:05.467 --> 38:07.826
Well, I'm saying
it's because of this curse I've got

38:07.868 --> 38:09.747
that the killer gave me.

38:09.789 --> 38:12.308
JP, for the love of God, can you
explain to me what's going on here?

38:12.346 --> 38:16.225
Sir, Ruby thinks that because she
handled the playing card the killer left,

38:16.264 --> 38:18.623
it's given her some kind of bad
luck.

38:18.666 --> 38:21.465
Well, it's true!
I spoke to Mama Ezola, and she told me...

38:21.508 --> 38:24.747
Wait! Mama Ezola?
Who the bejesus is Mama Ezola?

38:24.787 --> 38:27.506
Well, Mama Ezola, the
fortune-teller. I went to see her.

38:27.548 --> 38:30.107
She's just by the shop
that sold those playing cards.

38:30.143 --> 38:32.262
Anyway, she told me
that it's very possible

38:32.304 --> 38:36.903
that this card has been tainted
with the murderer's evil spirit.

38:36.942 --> 38:38.541
And some of it has rubbed off on me.

38:41.626 --> 38:44.865
Out of curiosity, Ruby, and just
getting back to the point for a sec,

38:44.905 --> 38:49.024
did the owner remember selling any
playing cards to one of our suspects?

38:49.063 --> 38:50.302
'Fraid not, sir.

38:50.341 --> 38:52.260
OK.

38:52.303 --> 38:55.862
Just to recap briefly
on what we still don't yet know.

38:55.903 --> 39:00.462
We still have no idea what that
playing card was doing on Florence's old desk.

39:00.502 --> 39:05.341
Nor do we have any idea how
or why the killer left the victim's body

39:05.383 --> 39:09.382
on our station floor, or why they
even killed Adam Renshaw in the first place!

39:16.182 --> 39:20.581
One for you.

39:20.621 --> 39:22.020
And one for me.

39:24.499 --> 39:25.658
JP SIGHS

39:29.542 --> 39:30.821
Why have you got that?

39:30.860 --> 39:34.819
Because I think that you and Mama
Ezola have got this whole thing wrong.

39:34.858 --> 39:38.457
JP, don't! I'm telling you,
it's cursed.

39:38.498 --> 39:41.497
Well, if my partner has been given a
curse,

39:41.538 --> 39:42.937
I'm going to be cursed with her,

39:42.980 --> 39:47.059
cos that's how we do things
in the police - together.

39:48.458 --> 39:51.297
Right. There.

39:51.338 --> 39:53.297
Now we've both got it.

40:15.095 --> 40:16.454
I can't do this.

40:30.292 --> 40:31.451
Inspector?

40:31.495 --> 40:34.294
Not like you to be burning
the midnight oil, sir.

40:34.336 --> 40:37.175
I have a meeting tomorrow morning
with the council

40:37.210 --> 40:39.409
to agree our annual budget,

40:39.453 --> 40:42.372
which they will no doubt try and
cut.

40:43.492 --> 40:45.611
Preparation is key.

40:45.654 --> 40:50.173
And what brings you here
at this late hour?

40:52.014 --> 40:55.453
I need to step away from the case,
sir, go back to London.

40:57.530 --> 40:59.289
Why do you need to go back?

41:02.412 --> 41:03.811
It's Siobhan, sir.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.729
Her fella has messed her around.

41:10.130 --> 41:14.009
And I know we all get our hearts
broken at one time or another, but...

41:15.412 --> 41:16.971
..she's missing her mother as well.

41:19.172 --> 41:21.411
All she has left is her dad,

41:21.448 --> 41:25.047
who's clueless
when it comes to this sort of stuff.

41:25.087 --> 41:27.726
Well, the thing is

41:27.767 --> 41:30.166
if I can't find the right words
to say to her,

41:30.210 --> 41:34.169
the one thing I am good at
is giving her a big hug.

41:36.609 --> 41:39.728
But...I can't do that
if I'm here and she's there...

41:40.887 --> 41:42.206
..can I?

41:44.606 --> 41:47.285
If your daughter is in need
of her father...

41:48.686 --> 41:50.085
..then you should go to her.

41:50.128 --> 41:51.887
You don't mind?

41:53.090 --> 41:56.609
Occasionally, it is right
that we put ourselves first.

41:56.648 --> 41:59.567
Take as long as you need.

41:59.604 --> 42:01.243
We'll just have to manage without
you.

42:02.404 --> 42:03.883
Thank you, sir.

42:03.928 --> 42:05.327
I mean it.

42:09.124 --> 42:13.563
Would it be at all inappropriate if
I was to give you a little hug yourself?

42:13.608 --> 42:14.647
Please don't.

42:16.083 --> 42:17.682
Goodnight, Inspector.

42:31.963 --> 42:34.762
COCKEREL CROWS

43:29.200 --> 43:31.439
Until DI Mooney
can return to Saint Marie

43:31.477 --> 43:33.716
and resume leading the
investigation,

43:33.758 --> 43:38.317
DS Dumas will be keeping his seat
warm for him.

43:39.798 --> 43:41.757
Er, Uncle Selwyn?

43:41.795 --> 43:44.114
Will Inspector Mooney be OK?

43:44.156 --> 43:47.675
I'm sure, once he's back in London,
reunited with his daughter,

43:47.716 --> 43:49.915
DI Mooney will be feeling
much more himself.

43:49.958 --> 43:51.757
OK.

43:51.795 --> 43:55.394
And a short break from the case
might be just what he needs.

44:00.116 --> 44:02.075
HORN BLARES

44:02.113 --> 44:05.112
INTERCOM:Apologies for the short
delay, ladies and gentlemen.

44:05.155 --> 44:06.994
A slight engine problem.

44:07.037 --> 44:08.836
But that's fixed,
and we're on our way now.

44:08.874 --> 44:12.673
Did he just say delay?
I heard that right, didn't I?

44:15.113 --> 44:17.312
And the cause of death
was not asphyxiation.

44:17.355 --> 44:19.154
Whoever did this certainly had the
means.

44:21.035 --> 44:22.874
Any money that was in the wallet
has been taken.

44:22.912 --> 44:24.431
It's just a piece of rubbish.

44:24.475 --> 44:25.874
Got your work cut out today, I
reckon.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.192
Fierce storm last night.

44:30.190 --> 44:33.949
Of course! I need to get off this
boat.

44:35.032 --> 44:37.871
No! No, no, no, no, no.

44:37.914 --> 44:39.353
Excuse me.

44:39.391 --> 44:42.590
Sorry, sorry to interrupt, is there
any way we could turn this boat around?

44:42.631 --> 44:43.950
No.
No.

44:43.989 --> 44:45.988
You don't understand. It's an
emergency!We can't.

44:57.549 --> 45:01.308
As we've got nowhere
with our current four suspects,

45:01.348 --> 45:04.627
maybe we should expand our search
and include local criminals.

45:04.667 --> 45:08.946
But if Inspector Mooney says
it's one of those four suspects,

45:08.991 --> 45:11.790
well, he's usually right
about these things.

45:11.825 --> 45:15.224
That does seem to be the way,
Sergeant, more often than not.

45:15.266 --> 45:18.225
Well, then we're stuck in the mud.
Non?

45:18.267 --> 45:19.386
Not any more we're not.

45:19.429 --> 45:21.548
- Inspector Mooney!
- Sir?

45:21.586 --> 45:22.785
You're supposed to be on a boat.

45:22.829 --> 45:25.188
I was. I jumped ship. Literally.

45:25.225 --> 45:26.864
You jumped off a ferry and swam
here?

45:26.907 --> 45:29.826
Why on Earth would you do that?
Because he's solved the case.

45:29.869 --> 45:31.468
I think I know now
what happened that night,

45:31.506 --> 45:34.305
but I need to speak to a doctor
to make sure.

45:34.346 --> 45:36.345
Phone the surgery in Honore.
Yes, sir.

45:36.388 --> 45:38.347
What exactly are you looking for,
sir?

45:38.386 --> 45:41.985
The ground plan of the campsite
with whose tent is whose marked up.

45:42.024 --> 45:45.343
This one.
Yeah. All right.

45:45.383 --> 45:49.542
Adam's. David's. Jay's. Gerald's.
And Hannah's. Of course.

45:49.583 --> 45:53.022
You know who did it, Inspector?
And I think I know how. And why.

45:53.062 --> 45:54.421
It's the full monty, Commissioner.

45:54.465 --> 45:56.104
I've got Dr Randolph on the phone
for you.

45:56.142 --> 45:57.221
Brilliant.

45:57.266 --> 45:58.505
If I'm right about this, Ruby.

45:58.543 --> 46:01.142
then you haven't caught
some killer's curse off that playing card.

46:01.184 --> 46:02.543
Really? Well, how do you know that?

46:02.582 --> 46:05.781
Well, it wasn't the killer who left
the card on the desk, it was the victim.

46:05.822 --> 46:08.221
Dr Randolph, it's DI Mooney here.

46:08.264 --> 46:09.583
Quick question for you.

46:15.582 --> 46:17.141
SQUELCHING

46:21.304 --> 46:24.023
Maybe I should just, erm... Yeah.

46:27.538 --> 46:30.777
You know, it's funny, but...

46:30.819 --> 46:32.978
..people always assume
that reaching middle age,

46:33.020 --> 46:37.059
things start to settle down in your
life.

46:37.099 --> 46:40.298
You become more stable and secure.

46:41.822 --> 46:43.301
You feel more at peace.

46:43.340 --> 46:48.779
But from my experience,
that couldn't be further from the truth.

46:48.821 --> 46:51.740
Cos the fact is, whatever age you
are,

46:51.780 --> 46:55.139
we're all still just as vulnerable
to those unexpected surprises

46:55.176 --> 47:00.255
that life throws at us as we were
when we were little kids.

47:01.497 --> 47:03.856
Now, the key to solving this murder

47:03.898 --> 47:07.817
is an understanding that Adam had
changed over the past few years.

47:07.856 --> 47:10.575
He'd grown into someone very
different

47:10.617 --> 47:14.416
to the man you knew as a reliable,
kind, loving husband and father.

47:14.456 --> 47:17.695
Bitterness had crept in. A
resentment.

47:17.735 --> 47:20.734
You might even call it a mid-life
crisis.

47:20.776 --> 47:23.575
He was jobless,
going through a messy divorce,

47:23.617 --> 47:26.016
living in a bedsit around the corner
from his wife and kids,

47:26.052 --> 47:28.731
and he was about to enter
a nasty custody battle,

47:28.774 --> 47:32.493
which he'd almost certainly lose.

47:32.533 --> 47:35.332
All of which explains
why he behaved so badly

47:35.374 --> 47:36.973
towards you the night he was killed.

47:37.017 --> 47:40.776
Whether it was because
he was desperate to feel loved

47:40.815 --> 47:43.014
or because he wanted to exert more
control

47:43.052 --> 47:47.731
and power over his increasingly
impotent life, we'll never know.

47:47.775 --> 47:49.374
Now, because of all this,

47:49.413 --> 47:52.612
Hannah briefly was a strong suspect
for the murder.

47:54.095 --> 47:56.694
But I now know that she didn't do
it.

47:56.730 --> 47:59.329
No. One of you three did.

48:03.410 --> 48:04.649
It was you, Gerald.

48:05.891 --> 48:07.450
Me?

48:09.531 --> 48:12.530
It wasn't me. Why would I kill Adam?
Sorry, you've got this all wrong.

48:12.571 --> 48:15.250
Oh, you see, you yourself admitted
to me

48:15.292 --> 48:18.011
that Adam's bullying of you
had started to take its toll.

48:18.052 --> 48:19.971
It had, but I told you,

48:20.009 --> 48:23.888
I wouldn't kill someone over just
that.Not just that.

48:23.929 --> 48:27.168
You see, in the same way
that Adam's life was unravelling,

48:27.209 --> 48:29.128
what led to you strangle him
was cumulative.

48:29.171 --> 48:31.330
That night up in the rainforest,

48:31.372 --> 48:33.691
you were in your tent,
the storm raging outside,

48:33.728 --> 48:36.087
when I think you heard Hannah
screaming.

48:36.130 --> 48:37.689
Now, your tent was closest to hers,

48:37.727 --> 48:39.766
which is why it had to be you.

48:39.809 --> 48:42.128
You heard her, but the others
didn't.

48:42.171 --> 48:44.410
So, you went out to see what was
going on.

48:44.447 --> 48:45.846
SCREAMS

48:49.050 --> 48:51.329
And I assume you hurried to
intervene.

48:51.365 --> 48:54.764
But before you could,
Adam had a moment of clarity.

48:54.805 --> 48:56.364
He walked away from Hannah,

48:56.409 --> 48:59.248
leaving you standing outside her
tent, alone.

49:03.249 --> 49:07.768
And in that moment,
I think you were filled with a rage.

49:07.806 --> 49:10.485
You'd already started to feel that
way towards Adam

49:10.525 --> 49:13.644
because of the way he'd been
treating you over the last couple of years.

49:13.687 --> 49:16.486
But seeing him assaulting a woman
that you'd befriended

49:16.528 --> 49:18.887
over the last few days,
I think it incensed you.

49:18.924 --> 49:21.363
And you hated him for it.

49:21.404 --> 49:24.123
Overwhelmed with emotion,
you found yourself

49:24.165 --> 49:28.204
with your hands tightening
the neckerchief around Adam's neck.

49:28.244 --> 49:30.323
I know you're not naturally a
violent man.

49:30.365 --> 49:34.364
The only other time you acted in
this way was trying to protect a defenceless woman.

49:34.405 --> 49:36.244
But when your emotions
get the better of you,

49:36.282 --> 49:38.841
the old red mist descends.

49:46.520 --> 49:49.999
And before you knew it,
Adam was lying dead on the ground.

49:53.440 --> 49:56.319
But if this did...happen,

49:56.360 --> 49:59.999
how did Adam's body end up
on your station floor?

50:00.039 --> 50:01.998
Yeah, that's a very good question.

50:02.041 --> 50:05.600
Now, the journey that Adam made
to the station was in two parts.

50:05.641 --> 50:08.480
Staring down at his body,
you knew you had to do something

50:08.522 --> 50:11.161
if you weren't going to be caught,
so you hoisted him up onto a horse

50:11.202 --> 50:14.201
and you led him down
through the rainforest and into town,

50:14.238 --> 50:16.077
where you dumped his body
around the back of a bar,

50:16.119 --> 50:17.638
beside some bins.

50:17.676 --> 50:19.155
HORSE WHINNIES

50:21.602 --> 50:23.921
You took his phone and his wallet,
and along with his neckerchief,

50:23.958 --> 50:25.757
dumped them in a bin.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.799
So next morning,
when Adam's body was found,

50:27.837 --> 50:30.436
it would be assumed he'd wandered
into town of his own accord,

50:30.477 --> 50:31.556
looking for a drink,

50:31.600 --> 50:33.479
and that he was killed during a
mugging.

50:35.998 --> 50:37.557
But what you didn't take into
account

50:37.596 --> 50:39.555
was that Adam,

50:39.599 --> 50:43.038
when you left him in that car park,
on the ground,

50:43.078 --> 50:44.437
he wasn't actually dead.

50:44.475 --> 50:46.474
GASPS

50:49.637 --> 50:53.636
The postmortem we received informed
me

50:53.676 --> 50:57.155
that Adam died of a stroke.

50:57.196 --> 50:59.755
Not asphyxiation, a stroke.

50:59.797 --> 51:01.916
But it wasn't until I spoke
to a doctor earlier today

51:01.954 --> 51:06.153
that I realised there could have
been a delay between the strangulation

51:06.197 --> 51:07.796
and his death.

51:07.834 --> 51:11.273
Gerald, when you moved Adam's body,

51:11.313 --> 51:12.672
you thought he was dead.

51:12.712 --> 51:15.151
But he wasn't. He was only
unconscious.

51:16.676 --> 51:21.035
So when he came to,
he got up and he went in search of help.

51:21.075 --> 51:24.314
But with the weather so bad,
there was no-one around.

51:24.354 --> 51:25.953
Everybody was inside,
safe and sound.

51:25.991 --> 51:27.470
So he headed for the one place

51:27.514 --> 51:29.593
that he thought he might find
some shelter.

51:29.630 --> 51:33.389
The police station.
The station was closed.

51:33.435 --> 51:37.354
Feeling increasingly ill and tired,
and scared,

51:37.394 --> 51:39.753
he knew the best thing he could do
was to somehow get inside

51:39.790 --> 51:42.149
the police station,
grab a phone and call an ambulance.

51:42.191 --> 51:44.150
Now, we all know
from watching the movies

51:44.193 --> 51:48.192
that a credit card is a very handy
device for breaking into a place.

51:48.233 --> 51:51.072
But with his wallet taken,
Adam didn't have a credit card.

51:51.113 --> 51:52.912
So he was forced to improvise.

51:52.950 --> 51:56.509
Now, you'll remember, there was
a lot of litter blowing around that night.

51:58.630 --> 52:01.669
Adam found a playing card.

52:01.710 --> 52:04.909
This playing card.

52:04.952 --> 52:07.351
Not dissimilar to a credit card.

52:07.388 --> 52:10.987
And he used it to push up the hook
locks on our station shutters.

52:13.668 --> 52:15.627
And once inside, closed the
shutters,

52:15.669 --> 52:17.188
put the locks back on the latches

52:17.226 --> 52:19.305
and moved towards the desk
in front of him.

52:19.349 --> 52:22.348
Which had only one thing on it -
a telephone.

52:22.390 --> 52:25.389
And he placed the playing card,

52:25.430 --> 52:27.229
and he reached for the phone
to call the ambulance

52:27.267 --> 52:30.946
when the cholesterol plaque
that had been dislodged

52:30.986 --> 52:34.585
when Gerald was strangling him
finally made its way to his brain,

52:34.625 --> 52:37.384
causing him to have
a massive, fatal stroke.

52:39.668 --> 52:43.107
Alone in the police station,
storm still howling outside,

52:43.147 --> 52:45.106
Adam Renshaw fell to the floor...

52:46.388 --> 52:47.347
..and he died.

52:52.867 --> 52:54.266
I didn't...

52:55.581 --> 52:56.700
I just...

52:59.787 --> 53:02.186
I don't know what I was doing.
I didn't mean to do it.

53:05.263 --> 53:06.862
GERALD SNIFFLES

53:06.905 --> 53:08.464
Come on.

53:09.540 --> 53:11.619
CUFFS CLICK

53:12.981 --> 53:14.900
Congratulations. You did it,
Inspector.

53:14.943 --> 53:17.182
No, no, Madeleine. We did it.

53:17.224 --> 53:18.823
Well...

53:31.023 --> 53:34.902
JP, remember last night
when you said that you and I were...

53:36.220 --> 53:37.499
..partners?

53:37.543 --> 53:39.142
Well, did you mean that?

53:39.181 --> 53:40.940
Yes, of course I did.

53:40.981 --> 53:42.100
Cos we are.

53:45.460 --> 53:48.099
I mean... Do you not think that?

53:50.378 --> 53:52.337
I don't know.

53:52.380 --> 53:53.939
It's just...

53:53.977 --> 53:55.976
The way I am in this job
sometimes...

53:57.901 --> 54:01.060
..I guess I'm just waiting for you
to realise

54:01.100 --> 54:03.099
that you can find someone better
than me.

54:05.420 --> 54:06.379
Ruby.

54:07.775 --> 54:09.974
I think you are a good officer.

54:11.216 --> 54:13.135
And if you keep on working
as hard as you do,

54:13.178 --> 54:16.297
pretty soon
you'll make a truly great officer.

54:16.337 --> 54:19.616
So you need to start getting used to
me calling you partner.

54:21.094 --> 54:23.133
Cos that is what we are.

54:23.177 --> 54:25.856
A team. You got it?

54:27.655 --> 54:30.134
Oh, OK.

54:31.334 --> 54:33.773
All right, all right, all right, OK.

54:33.815 --> 54:35.534
Get your helmet on. Now let's go.

54:42.053 --> 54:43.932
VOICEMAIL:This is Siobhan's
phone.

54:43.975 --> 54:45.974
Leave a message and I'll call you
back. BEEP

54:46.017 --> 54:47.776
Hiya, love. It's me.

54:47.814 --> 54:52.693
So, apparently, no seats available
for the next five days.

54:52.736 --> 54:56.095
But they have me on standby
if anything turns up in the meantime.

54:57.654 --> 54:59.293
So I'll hopefully see you very soon.

55:01.053 --> 55:02.132
Love you.

55:10.733 --> 55:13.332
Can you just imagine him
swimming all the way to shore?

55:13.375 --> 55:16.614
And here's the hero of the hour.
Hey!

55:16.655 --> 55:19.054
Stop it, stop it, you'll make me
blush.

55:19.090 --> 55:21.169
Did you manage to get another
flight, sir?

55:21.212 --> 55:24.211
Well, I'm on a waiting list,
so hopefully next day or so.

55:24.253 --> 55:27.212
Well, I've got everything crossed
for you, Inspector Mooney.

55:28.810 --> 55:33.489
Inspector, you went well beyond
the call of duty today.

55:33.528 --> 55:35.527
You made a big sacrifice for this
island.

55:35.570 --> 55:38.249
Oh, just glad I was able to catch
you your man, sir.

55:38.291 --> 55:41.690
It's not often I get a chance
to show my gratitude to you.

55:41.730 --> 55:44.449
But on this occasion, I'd like to.

55:44.491 --> 55:46.330
Oh, well, really, there's no need,
Commissioner.

55:46.367 --> 55:49.526
But if you're asking,
a small rum wouldn't go amiss.

55:49.569 --> 55:51.168
Oh!

55:51.211 --> 55:52.850
I think we can do
a little better than that.

55:52.888 --> 55:54.807
CAR DOOR CLOSES

56:02.567 --> 56:04.126
No. You didn't?

56:04.165 --> 56:05.324
I did.

56:05.369 --> 56:07.168
Thank you, sir.

56:07.206 --> 56:09.445
No, thank you, Inspector.

56:09.487 --> 56:14.086
Oh, my God,
it's so bloody good to see you!

56:18.004 --> 56:19.563
And how are you? Are you doing all
right?

56:19.606 --> 56:21.205
Yeah, I'm doing all right.

56:21.244 --> 56:23.043
I just can't believe it.

56:32.407 --> 56:33.566
This island,

56:33.605 --> 56:39.284
it has a certain magic
about it, Sergeant Dumas.

56:40.764 --> 56:44.083
You know, I think
I'm already starting to learn that.

56:45.203 --> 56:49.122
Such a shame you won't get a chance
to experience it a bit more.

56:50.763 --> 56:53.322
This is Ruby.
She is a real person, I told you.

56:53.363 --> 56:56.362
It's so good to meet you.
And, of course, JP you know.

56:56.405 --> 57:00.004
And this is Madeleine,
all the way from Paris.

57:00.044 --> 57:01.403
Yeah!
Nice to meet you.

57:01.442 --> 57:05.481
And, of course, the Commissioner.
As this is now a celebration...

57:05.520 --> 57:07.919
..the drinks are on the house!
Hey!

57:07.961 --> 57:11.360
- Hey!
- Wine for you, Sarge.

57:11.402 --> 57:13.881
All right. Cheers!

57:13.923 --> 57:16.242
ALL:Cheers!

57:22.000 --> 57:24.239
This is incredible.
Were you all in on this?
