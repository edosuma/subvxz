00:11.379 --> 00:12.578
We're ridiculous.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.080
Henry:
A ridiculous love story.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.216
This is the last time
i heard from her.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.685
It was a week
after she disappeared.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.155
She only wanted time
to think, to be alone.

00:23.157 --> 00:26.392
I'm sorry, but i don't think
she<i> wants</i> to be found.

00:26.394 --> 00:30.763
Should have known mom would be
living under an alias.

00:30.765 --> 00:31.897
Sylvia blake?

00:31.899 --> 00:33.198
And i should have known

00:33.200 --> 00:34.933
She'd combine the names
of our favorite poets.

00:34.935 --> 00:38.203
To think that she lived so close
all these years.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.304
All these years?

00:39.306 --> 00:41.306
Dad, she was in her 70s
when she left.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.941
And?

00:42.943 --> 00:45.177
Well, that might not seem so old
to<i> you,</i> but to us mortals...

00:45.179 --> 00:46.278
Yes. You're right.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.647
Chances are
she died years ago.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.283
Certainly beats the alternative
that she simply forgot about us.

00:51.285 --> 00:55.020
Hey, hey, come on.
That's not the mom i remember.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.956
Why don't we go
to her last address

00:57.958 --> 00:59.958
And see
who else might remember?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.393
Yes.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.761
I'll drive.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.997
Unh! I'm not letting you
get anywhere near my car.

And -- and that's not
including

01:14.442 --> 01:17.142
The lift tickets,
the ski rental, the food?

01:17.144 --> 01:19.978
I'm the one
taking them skiing, remember?

01:19.980 --> 01:23.048
But can't we at least try
to love them on a budget, karen?

01:31.826 --> 01:33.492
I thought you and isaac
were in paris.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.660
That fell through.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.929
What, the trip
or the relationship?

01:37.932 --> 01:38.630
Both.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.466
Sorry to hear it.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.234
Thanks.
Sorry for<i> me.</i>

01:42.236 --> 01:44.103
Look, jo, the only reason
i took time off

01:44.105 --> 01:45.771
Is 'cause
you were gonna be gone.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.173
I don't want to get stuck here

01:48.175 --> 01:51.977
It's a family ski trip.
Just go have a good time.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.278
Henry and i will

Oh. You didn't hear?

Where did he go?

01:57.251 --> 01:58.350
I don't know.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.319
Big guy said he needed
a few personal days.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.687
I don't blame him.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.122
Did he say why?

02:03.124 --> 02:05.124
Look, just because
i'm now henry's best friend

02:05.126 --> 02:06.825
Doesn't mean
i know everything.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.761
Lucas, what are you
not telling me?

02:10.598 --> 02:12.931
Henry didn't -- he --
he didn't take a few days off

02:12.933 --> 02:14.366
Because of me?

02:14.368 --> 02:16.068
Wait. What -- what -- what --

No. What is -- no.
I don't know what that is.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.341
I mean, it's totally cool
if you guys are.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.376
You'd automatically be

You know, and then if you had
any single lady friends,

About his mother,
who disappeared in the '80s.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.797
He didn't give me
the full story,

02:45.799 --> 02:48.333
But, apparently, she was
on the run from something.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.736
So, what's the story
with abe's father?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.104

03:06.086 --> 03:09.454
Maybe looking
for peace and quiet.

03:09.456 --> 03:10.689
Or maybe she was hiding.

in a while.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.330
You knew her?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.198
She used to live in

03:53.200 --> 03:54.633
But that was
a long time ago.

See, the reason we were asking
is i'm her son.

You don't know
what happened to her?

No idea.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.343
One morning,
she was just gone.

we exhumed from her yard

on her person.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.395
There must be
a connection.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.966
I was just
going over the body.

11:07.968 --> 11:11.636
Lucas noted fractures in
the right clavicle and radius.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.471
His theory,
along with the fatal blow,

11:13.473 --> 11:15.974
That these injures were
sustained during the fracas.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.275
And what do<i> you</i> think?

11:17.277 --> 11:19.110
Well, looking at her wrist
under magnification,

11:19.112 --> 11:22.080
It appears that her bone
was moved back into alignment.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.015
She had it set.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.550
By a medical professional.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.186
And then struck over the head
and killed

11:28.188 --> 11:29.854
Before it had time
to heal.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.157
And then she was buried
in a nurse's backyard.

11:32.159 --> 11:35.093

the connection between this case

take a trip with me, detective?

11:55.816 --> 11:57.348
You could be in paris,

11:57.350 --> 11:59.984
But instead, you're in
a tarrytown emergency room.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.853
I made the right choice.

12:01.855 --> 12:05.123

come to me first.

a little uncomfortable

12:16.970 --> 12:18.803
The other night
when i showed up.

It would take a lot more than
that to make me uncomfortable.

of the wrist and collarbone.

to figure out

How belinda ended up
in her backyard.

Well, maybe there's someone
who worked here back then.

One day, she just
didn't show up for work.

Sylvia left the way she came,
just like that --

13:07.521 --> 13:08.787

a patient sylvia treated

before she left?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.227
Wow. Good memory.

was hard to forget.

treating the girl

13:22.369 --> 13:23.601
When a hit-and-run

Do you know how
the girl with the broken arm

13:37.050 --> 13:38.116
Ended up at sylvia's?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.118
Sylvia took the poor thing
home with her.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.654
She was always doing
that sort of thing.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.490
Look -- on the file,
she marked the injury a 273.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.492
It's police code
for domestic assault.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.629
That would explain why sylvia
took her home -- to protect her.

13:51.631 --> 13:55.600
Does the file say who
checked her into the hospital?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.569

that name?

15:29.195 --> 15:31.029
Is that the fracture
to belinda's collarbone

15:31.031 --> 15:32.830
Is consistent
with a car crash.
