I wish I had something
more concrete to tell you.

01:04.019 --> 01:05.630
Everything appears normal.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.197
You're sure.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.199
We found no irregularities
in your brain scans,

01:09.243 --> 01:12.333
and comprehensive testing of any
residual drugs in your system

01:12.376 --> 01:14.639
all came back clean.

01:14.683 --> 01:15.771
It's just the nightmares

01:15.814 --> 01:18.252
I've been having are intense.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.731
Well, you were tortured, Dwayne.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.907
Exposed to powerful
hallucinogens.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.146
The truth is,
there's still a lot

01:23.170 --> 01:24.780
we don't understand
about these drugs.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.671
Yeah, but there must be some way
to get the nightmares to stop.

01:26.695 --> 01:28.131
Fill the prescription
I gave you.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.741
Take the sleeping pills.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.004
Can't risk it. Never know
when I might get called out.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.310
You also can't risk

01:33.354 --> 01:35.704
going weeks without
a good night's sleep.

01:35.747 --> 01:38.707
It's dangerous
physically and mentally.

01:38.750 --> 01:43.146
And you threw that prescription
away, didn't you?

01:48.282 --> 01:50.327
It's always the same people.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.503
A victim from a past case,

01:52.547 --> 01:55.550
a guy in a red suit.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.291
Think it means something?

01:57.334 --> 01:59.771
Maybe but not necessarily.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.731
Just remember,
it is not the dream

02:02.774 --> 02:05.690
telling you something,
it's you telling yourself.

02:08.431 --> 02:11.392
It's Loretta.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.176
I need to go.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.178
Tell her I said hi.
Yeah.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.224
Dwayne.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.816
You're just gonna toss it
again, aren't you?

02:23.055 --> 02:26.276
Well, if the sleeping issues
persist, come back.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.887
We could try some more...

02:28.931 --> 02:30.498
innovative options.

02:30.541 --> 02:33.414
Sure.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.632
Thanks.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.636
It's from 1998.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.248
Uh, case 5-3-6-4.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.947
Yes, I need
the M.E. reports

02:44.990 --> 02:47.123
and any evidence in storage

02:47.167 --> 02:49.604
as soon as possible, please.

02:49.647 --> 02:50.605
Thank you.

02:50.648 --> 02:53.695
'98... year we met.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.306
You were still
a Jefferson Parish sheriff.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.266
And you took over this place,

02:59.309 --> 03:01.442
changing everything

03:01.485 --> 03:03.270
and getting everyone's
feathers ruffled.

03:03.313 --> 03:07.099
I did make a lot
of old men mad, didn't I?

03:07.143 --> 03:09.014
Progress usually does.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.973
You looking into a case?

03:11.016 --> 03:12.540
The first we worked together.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.237
Ashley Griffin.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.370
Teenager who went missing,

03:16.413 --> 03:18.807
was found dead a few days later.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.939
Jerrod Wallis
was still officially

03:20.983 --> 03:23.159
the M.E. at that point,

03:23.203 --> 03:24.639
so it was his case.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.729
He confirmed that
a baseball bat found

03:27.772 --> 03:29.426
with the body
was the murder weapon.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.515
But he couldn't tie it
to our prime suspect.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.213
Elliot Whitman.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.432
You remembering all this
from over 20 years ago?

03:35.476 --> 03:37.391
I wish. No.

03:37.434 --> 03:40.394
I got a call from NYPD.

03:40.437 --> 03:43.223
They currently have
Elliot Whitman in custody.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.312
He's in New York?
Evidently,

03:45.355 --> 03:47.009
there was a fire
in his apartment.

03:47.052 --> 03:50.578
And the firefighters
broke through a wall

03:50.621 --> 03:53.537
and discovered this
hidden in the vent.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.453
Elliot Whitman is still flagged
as a person on interest

03:56.497 --> 03:58.499
in the Ashley Griffin murder,

03:58.542 --> 04:00.414
so they tested for DNA.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.111
Yeah, they're hers, Dwayne.

04:02.154 --> 04:04.374
He kept them all these years.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.309
He claims he had no idea
that box was in the vent.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.509
Yeah, he's a good liar.
Always was.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.424
Well, we still have to prove it.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.731
And they don't have enough
to hold him for very long.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.560
I told NYPD that I would
look through the autopsy

04:16.603 --> 04:18.387
and forensic files,

04:18.432 --> 04:20.521
see if there was anything
I could find to help.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.194
You know I had to cancel
a trip to New York

04:22.218 --> 04:23.654
a couple weeks ago.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.874
Laurel must have been
very disappointed.

04:25.917 --> 04:29.007
Sounds like this might be
a perfect time for a visit.

04:30.574 --> 04:31.793
Yeah, when's the, uh,

04:31.836 --> 04:34.491
the next training course
taking place?

04:34.535 --> 04:37.102
Okay, and what's the deadline
to apply for the opening?

04:37.146 --> 04:38.887
Got a hit
on his credit card.
Oh.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.976
Oh, sorry.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.388
That's-that's great,
that's all I needed to know.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.544
Thank you. Bye.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.372
What are you applying for?

04:45.415 --> 04:49.201
Huh? I am applying...

04:49.245 --> 04:51.943
for a refi on my house,
'cause these rates,

04:51.987 --> 04:53.771
I'm telling you,
they're dynamite.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.011
Did you say you
found your brother?
Not yet.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.602
But Cade used
one of his credit cards

04:58.646 --> 05:01.518
outside of Mobile yesterday,
so he didn't go far.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.390
Has Patton got a
hit on his cell?

05:03.433 --> 05:04.869
Been off-line for a week now.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.282
And he hasn't reached out
to the girlfriend at all?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.785
Not since he left her

05:07.829 --> 05:09.570
and her son at that motel.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.112
Man, it's just, it's weird
that they don't know why

05:11.136 --> 05:12.399
he hid them away like that.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.724
Well, that's why I brought 'em
back with me.

05:13.748 --> 05:14.792
Figured they'd be safer

05:14.836 --> 05:16.446
at my place until I find him.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.448
Yeah, well, you know,
I got an old PS3

05:18.492 --> 05:20.513
and some games I don't play
anymore if the kid gets bored.

05:20.537 --> 05:23.584
Bored? I live right on the
water, he can fish for hours.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.692
Yeah, you're right. I should
probably give you my Xbox, too.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.239
Any other witnesses?

05:27.283 --> 05:28.502
What is that, a new case?

05:28.545 --> 05:30.330
Actually, it's an old one.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.636
Murder Pride was involved with
20 years ago.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.812
16-year-old, Ashley Griffin.

05:34.856 --> 05:37.598
Daughter of the dean at a local
school for troubled kids.

05:37.641 --> 05:38.705
Guy they thought killed her
was the same age.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.340
Elliot Whitman.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.578
He was a student at
the Fresh Start Academy

05:41.602 --> 05:42.472
where her dad worked.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.821
Witness saw him follow Ashley

05:43.865 --> 05:45.127
the day she went missing.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.955
Four days later,
her body was found

05:46.998 --> 05:49.479
in a shed a couple of miles
from campus.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.785
She was severely beaten.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.458
Time of death indicates
that she was kept alive

05:52.482 --> 05:53.764
until the morning
the body was discovered.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.268
No sign of sexual assault,
though.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.706
So the killer left her alive
just to terrorize her?

05:58.749 --> 06:00.534
Maybe he was
working up the nerve.

06:00.577 --> 06:02.405
Pride was at JPSO then.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.146
I didn't know
he was on this case.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.843
Another sheriff was
the lead investigator.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.212
Pride was just
brought in to assist.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.953
Case fell apart not long
after that, though.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.370
Whitman maintained
his innocence,

06:10.413 --> 06:11.936
and there wasn't
any hard evidence.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.938
Why bring it up now? Because Pride

06:13.982 --> 06:15.505
just got one more shot
at this jerk.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.076
Hey, Laurel, it's Dad.

06:21.119 --> 06:24.775
Grabbing something
to eat sounds great.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.735
I'll keep you posted
on my schedule.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.476
Can't wait to see you.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.179
Oh, thanks so much.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.615
Special Agent Pride?

06:38.659 --> 06:40.530
Mm. Lieutenant Baker.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.619
Thanks for opening your doors.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.013
We are happy for any assistance
you can give.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.057
Whitman still in custody?

06:46.101 --> 06:47.450
Uh, for now.

06:47.494 --> 06:50.061
But he claims he didn't know
the box was in that vent.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.672
Unfortunately, we were unable

06:51.715 --> 06:54.022
to find his prints
or DNA on the box

06:54.065 --> 06:55.806
or the items inside.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.982
Which means he's
being careful. Well, it's working.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.091
Right now we don't have anything
that'll hold up in court.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.377
Mind if I talk to him?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.335
He's in interrogation
with one of my detectives.

07:03.379 --> 07:06.338
Maybe you can get more
out of him than we have.

07:06.382 --> 07:09.516
You understand why I'm finding
this hard to believe, right?

07:09.559 --> 07:12.562
I don't know how many times
I can say it, Detective.

07:12.606 --> 07:15.522
I have never seen
any of that stuff before.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.481
Mm. So who is this mysterious
person you believe

07:18.525 --> 07:20.657
is hiding things
in your apartment?

07:20.701 --> 07:21.963
Hmm?

07:22.006 --> 07:23.704
Sorry for the intrusion,
Cabrera.

07:23.747 --> 07:24.985
I got somebody here
who'd like a word.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.663
This is
Special Agent Dwayne Pride

07:26.707 --> 07:29.144
with NCIS.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.581
You remember me, Mr. Whitman?

07:33.409 --> 07:34.628
No, please.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.109
You've got to keep him away.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.522
You can't leave me alone
with him, please.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.764
Okay, okay.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.810
He'll hurt me again,
just like the last time.

07:42.853 --> 07:43.941
Mr. Whitman.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.160
Agent Pride.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.640
Out! Keep him away from me!

07:55.126 --> 07:57.128
So, you screwed up your case
20 years ago

07:57.172 --> 07:58.976
and now you're about
to screw up mine? BAKER: Cabrera.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.220
First off,
I never touched Whitman.

08:02.264 --> 08:03.700
And he knows that.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.007
But somebody did.

08:06.050 --> 08:09.140
I was brought in
to the case late.

08:09.184 --> 08:12.404
The lead was Frank McTeague,
a good cop.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.494
30 years on the job,

08:14.537 --> 08:16.539
but he got obsessed
with Whitman.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.889
Let it get personal.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.215
Was there any physical evidence
tying Whitman to the murder?

08:21.239 --> 08:24.155
No, just one witness who'd seen
him following Ashley.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.722
That's pretty thin.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.071
Which Elliot Whitman knew.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.551
He was arrogant.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.118
Taunted McTeague about how

08:30.161 --> 08:31.946
he was gonna walk free.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.426
Frank knew he needed
a confession.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.818
So he tried to beat it
out of him.

08:35.863 --> 08:36.951
Detective, enough.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.648
He's right.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.780
Whitman kept at McTeague

08:40.823 --> 08:42.347
until he finally snapped.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.524
I never should have
left them alone.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.396
I broke it up,
but-but the damage was done.

08:47.439 --> 08:50.399
Whitman's family
threatened to sue.

08:50.442 --> 08:51.835
D.A. dropped the case.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.184
We had to let him go.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.185
Well, it's not gonna
happen here.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.709
We got this, Lou.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.799
Cabrera, you're good but green.

08:58.842 --> 09:00.409
Someone offers to assist

09:00.452 --> 09:01.952
with as much experience
as Special Agent Pride,

09:01.976 --> 09:03.717
you take that help.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.895
We can hold Whitman on suspicion
for another 24 hours, tops.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.071
We don't find something
more concrete,

09:10.114 --> 09:12.639
he is going to walk again.

09:12.682 --> 09:15.859
Show him what we got.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.911
All I want is justice
for Ashley Griffin.

09:23.954 --> 09:26.391
It's been a long time coming.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.439
It's not just Ashley.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.267
Truth is, it's a lucky break

09:32.310 --> 09:34.443
we got Whitman
in custody at all.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.880
The fire.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.752
It started
in the neighbor's apartment.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.754
When the firefighters
broke through the wall,

09:40.797 --> 09:43.191
they found the box.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.934
These were in the box, too?

09:46.977 --> 09:49.371
With Ashley's underwear.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.547
Any DNA?

09:51.591 --> 09:54.506
Nothing.
These three were wiped clean.

09:54.550 --> 09:55.745
You know what I think they are?

09:55.769 --> 09:57.031
Trophies.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.685
Yeah.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.512
Which means that Whitman killed

10:00.556 --> 10:03.864
at least three other women
over the last 20 years.

10:08.129 --> 10:09.870
Tell us what you need, Pride.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.960
We need to look at Ashley's
murder with fresh eyes.

10:13.003 --> 10:16.137
Talk to anyone who was at the
school when she was killed.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.573
See what they remember.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.835
I'll start tracking 'em down.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.532
Sebastian.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.728
Loretta has all the evidence
from the '98 investigation.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.145
Can you give her a hand?

10:24.188 --> 10:25.644
Yeah, sure.
We'll put everything underneath

10:25.668 --> 10:26.930
a 2019 microscope.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.498
Okay. And we got some new leads.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.196
NYPD forwarded you
everything they have

10:32.240 --> 10:34.808
on three items found
in the same box

10:34.851 --> 10:38.202
where Whitman kept
Ashley's undergarment.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.030
All women's things.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.139
What, do you think they're
trophies from other kills? PRIDE: I do.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.730
But we need to prove it.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.775
Connect them to
specific murders.

10:45.819 --> 10:48.386
And then connect Whitman
to these victims. We should look

10:48.430 --> 10:51.085
for similar crimes in places
where Whitman lived or worked.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.522
Yeah, that's a good
place to start.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.089
I'm gonna check out
his apartment,

10:55.132 --> 10:56.568
but I'm reachable

10:56.612 --> 10:58.788
if you find anything.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.573
Most serial killers stick
to the same hunting grounds,

11:01.617 --> 11:04.489
but Whitman's moved around a lot
in the last 20 years.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.405
Then we'd better start digging.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.451
Yeah.

11:16.806 --> 11:18.547
Oh. Hey, Chris.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.418
We weren't expecting you back
till tonight.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.788
Oh, I'm not staying.
I just wanted to drop
off some groceries.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.553
Saw the pantry was getting low.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.686
Aw, that's sweet.
But I actually went shopping.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.427
I didn't want you to have
to go to any trouble.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.864
Did you find Cade yet?

11:30.907 --> 11:32.822
I didn't.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.278
But he did use his
credit card yesterday

11:34.302 --> 11:36.652
just outside of Mobile.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.828
At least that means he's okay.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.438
My buddy's a cop out there.

11:40.482 --> 11:41.701
He's gonna stop by the store,

11:41.744 --> 11:42.852
see if he can find
anything useful.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.268
Whatever's going on,

11:44.312 --> 11:46.270
it must be pretty bad
for him to just...

11:46.314 --> 11:48.316
leave us like that.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.970
I love my brother,

11:50.013 --> 11:51.232
but, uh...

11:51.275 --> 11:53.713
he's had a troubled road.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.758
Struggled
with some mental issues.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.848
I know. He told me
about his bipolar disorder.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.371
Yeah.

12:00.415 --> 12:03.853
Wouldn't be the first time
he just... took off.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.551
Cade wouldn't abandon us.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.729
He wouldn't.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.775
So I'll keep looking.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.822
Thank you again for everything.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.476
No problem.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.662
You okay?

12:30.706 --> 12:31.838
Yeah.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.883
You must be worried.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.495
I hear you and Cade
get along pretty well.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.932
I mean, he's cool.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.630
And he's been teaching me
to shoot three-pointers.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.460
I remember him draining those
from the corner.

12:45.503 --> 12:46.983
He still got a shot?

12:47.027 --> 12:48.071
Oh, yeah.

12:51.074 --> 12:54.077
Look, if there's anything you
think I should know about Cade,

12:54.121 --> 12:55.905
it could stay between us.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.516
I don't.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.563
You sure?

13:02.651 --> 13:05.219
Look, I said I didn't. Okay?

13:05.262 --> 13:07.525
♪

13:16.578 --> 13:18.101
How'd it start?

13:18.145 --> 13:19.886
Grease fire
in the neighbor's kitchen.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.105
She tried to put it out
with water,

13:22.149 --> 13:23.933
so it spread. Was Whitman home
at the time?

13:23.977 --> 13:25.195
No. Probably
the only reason

13:25.239 --> 13:26.893
the box was still in the vent

13:26.936 --> 13:28.938
when the firefighters arrived.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.897
Unit 14, clear.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.812
Expensive setup.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.770
Oh, yeah. Guessing he spends

13:34.814 --> 13:36.076
most of his time here.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.339
Far as we can tell,
Whitman has no friends

13:38.382 --> 13:40.080
or family he stays
in touch with.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.343
You get access to his phone,
social media accounts?

13:42.386 --> 13:44.266
Our Crime Center's combing
through all that now.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.783
Appreciate you
looping my team in, too.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.003
NYPD's the largest
force in the nation.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.005
There's nothing your team can do
that we can't.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.920
You might be surprised. NADINE:
Ma, don't.

13:53.963 --> 13:57.924
What am I supposed to do,
live in a hotel room for
the rest of my life?

13:57.967 --> 13:59.360
You a cop? Detective.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.404
Great.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.579
When are you gonna be done?

14:01.623 --> 14:03.973
When we're done. The super said

14:04.017 --> 14:06.082
he won't fix the wall
until you people say it's okay.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.368
Excuse me, ma'am.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.892
You live next door? Yeah. And If you

14:09.936 --> 14:12.329
haven't noticed, I have
a giant hole in the wall.Ma.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.549
You have much interaction
with Elliot Whitman?

14:14.592 --> 14:15.898
Yeah.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.073
None of it good.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.902
Five times
I called management on him.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.730
Leaving his trash in the hall.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.210
Watching sicko videos so loud

14:23.253 --> 14:25.908
you can hear through the walls.
He's a creep.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.712
He's always hanging out
in the halls, staring at me

14:27.736 --> 14:28.998
when I come visit Ma.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.435
Sometimes I won't even come in
if he's in town.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.133
How often is he gone?

14:33.176 --> 14:34.699
Not often enough.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.702
A few weeks at a time
every now and then.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.008
I'll tell you what,

14:39.052 --> 14:40.880
we're gonna make some calls.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.274
See if we can't get you cleared
to start fixing that wall.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.755
Thanks.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.452
At least somebody gets it.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.106
Thank you.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.937
Really know how to work
that Southern charm, don't you?

14:54.981 --> 14:57.157
Being polite don't cost a thing.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.160
We need to find out where and
when Whitman took those trips.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.615
Try and connect him
to other murders.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.400
It's still circumstantial.
We don't have his prints

15:03.424 --> 15:06.209
or DNA on the box,
and he claims it isn't his.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.776
Whitman is careful,

15:07.819 --> 15:09.038
but we're smart.

15:09.082 --> 15:11.084
We just need to stay focused,

15:11.127 --> 15:13.913
build this case
one piece at a time.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.528
NCIS! On the ground!

15:21.964 --> 15:23.096
Stay down!

15:24.097 --> 15:25.794
Stay down!

15:25.837 --> 15:27.622
Very exciting.Hey.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.016
Don't you have evidence
to be testing?

15:30.059 --> 15:33.019
Yeah, and I'm totally,
uh, almost done with it.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.108
Isn't that

15:35.151 --> 15:36.370
the NCIS REACT team?

15:36.413 --> 15:38.850
Yeah, it is.
You-you know 'em?

15:38.894 --> 15:40.417
They're...
they're amazing.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.506
They handle our most
dangerous situations.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.117
Active shooters.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.901
Violent felon takedowns.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.729
What's this about?

15:48.730 --> 15:50.688
I'm actually thinking
of applying.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.212
To REACT?

15:52.255 --> 15:54.214
Yeah, what do you think?

15:54.257 --> 15:56.216
It's a terrible idea.

15:56.259 --> 15:58.435
You're a scientist, not that.

15:58.479 --> 16:01.873
Well... man, tell me
how you reallyfeel.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.837
Well, I can't even believe
you're considering it.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.095
Now...

16:07.227 --> 16:08.595
What did you find
with the evidence?

16:08.619 --> 16:10.273
Not much.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.757
Even using today's
Mass Spectrometer,

16:11.796 --> 16:13.755
I didn't detect any DNA.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.018
So...

16:16.062 --> 16:17.977
we've got nothing to help Pride.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.326
Well, now, I didn't say that.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.328
Uh, when you reviewed
these autopsy photos,

16:21.371 --> 16:22.982
you found some
inconsistencies, right?

16:23.025 --> 16:25.419
Yes, uh, contusion patterns

16:25.462 --> 16:28.074
and the positioning of
the radial fractures. Yeah, well, something

16:28.117 --> 16:30.380
was definitely off, so I
scanned it all into the system,

16:30.424 --> 16:32.382
and the computer is now
enhancing all the images,

16:32.426 --> 16:34.994
creating an HD replica
of the wounds.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.388
And you have perfect timing.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.173
Now, that's excellent,
Sebastian.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.174
There.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.176
Can you zoom in?
Yeah.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.265
The brain pattern

16:45.308 --> 16:47.354
matches the wood bat
they found at the scene.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.356
The other one has a...

16:49.399 --> 16:51.271
crosshatched pattern.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.229
I think it's fiberglass.

16:53.273 --> 16:56.624
Which would mean that there
wasn't just one murder weapon.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.756
There were two.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.802
Uh... interesting.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.847
I guess.

17:02.891 --> 17:05.241
It's an assistant
manager position

17:05.285 --> 17:07.242
in Special Events.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.115
Ah, well, that sounds
like a promotion.

17:09.157 --> 17:11.160
You gonna take it?

17:11.204 --> 17:15.164
No, which is exactly what
I told you two minutes ago.

17:17.339 --> 17:20.300
Sorry, my mind wandered.

17:20.343 --> 17:21.736
You can't blame yourself, Dad.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.520
That sheriff was
your senior officer.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.521
And if I kept my eye on him...

17:25.566 --> 17:27.523
Whitman might not have walked

17:27.568 --> 17:31.267
and three more woman
might still be alive today.

17:31.311 --> 17:34.096
You said this guy was
some kind of legend

17:34.140 --> 17:35.576
in the department, right?

17:35.619 --> 17:37.293
Yeah, a lot of what I know
about investigating,

17:37.317 --> 17:39.275
I learned from Frank McTeague.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.190
So how exactly were you
supposed to stop him?

17:41.234 --> 17:43.584
By not believing
such an obvious lie.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.325
How'd he get you
out of the room?

17:45.368 --> 17:47.477
He told me to get the kid a soda
and something to eat.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.372
That sounds pretty legit to me.

17:49.416 --> 17:53.115
But I knew how much McTeague
hated Whitman by then.

17:53.159 --> 17:56.118
I should have figured out
what he was planning.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.685
You weren't his babysitter, Dad.

17:57.728 --> 17:58.903
Honey...

17:58.947 --> 18:00.035
Excuse me.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.124
Sorry to interrupt.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.170
You must be Laurel.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.910
Honey...

18:05.954 --> 18:07.173
Detective Cabrera.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.261
David.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.393
Place was my suggestion.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.829
Hope it's okay.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.571
It's perfect.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.399
You have excellent taste.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.487
Only the best

18:17.531 --> 18:19.185
for Special Agent Pride.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.490
We have such respect

18:20.534 --> 18:21.728
for your father. Is there something

18:21.752 --> 18:23.798
I can help you with, Cabrera?

18:23.841 --> 18:27.062
I have been working
with your team in New Orleans.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.411
Mm-hmm. I like that, uh...

18:28.455 --> 18:30.152
uh, Gregorio?

18:30.196 --> 18:32.241
She reminds me of my sister.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.025
She's a real ballbuster.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.811
You might want to keep
that comparison to yourself.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.293
Nah. She gets me.

18:40.336 --> 18:43.426
Anyway, they identified murders
in three other states

18:43.470 --> 18:46.647
that they think they can connect
to the items in Whitman's box.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.258
All with the same M.O.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.130
You okay hearing this?

18:51.173 --> 18:53.436
I'm a cop's kid;
nothing shocks me.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.264
I was a cop's kid, too.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.440
We should...
compare notes sometime.

18:57.484 --> 18:58.789
Okay. Cabrera.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.401
Anyway...

19:01.444 --> 19:04.099
three murders, same M.O.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.188
Women abducted,
kept alive for several days,

19:06.232 --> 19:08.103
then beat to death and dumped.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.603
All right, so we need to get
Whitman's travel information. We got it

19:10.627 --> 19:12.325
from his e-mails, calendars.

19:12.368 --> 19:15.197
We can place him
a couple hours' drive
from all three.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.566
Well, that's enough
to arrest him, right?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.461
Should be. Problem is,

19:18.505 --> 19:20.507
we got more
than we bargained for.

19:20.550 --> 19:23.162
Your team didn't just find
those three.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.033
They found four more.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.774
Four additional murders?

19:26.817 --> 19:28.341
Almost identical.

19:28.384 --> 19:31.213
Women kept alive
for several days, then killed,

19:31.257 --> 19:33.084
all across the U.S.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.347
Only Whitman...

19:34.390 --> 19:37.045
he was nowhere near
those other four.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.742
He couldn't have done it.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.223
Well, that fits in
with our M.E.'s analysis

19:41.267 --> 19:43.182
of Ashley Griffin's murder.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.400
She says that two weapons

19:44.444 --> 19:45.314
were used.

19:45.358 --> 19:46.837
Blows were delivered

19:46.881 --> 19:49.579
from opposite directions
with different levels of force.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.799
Two killers.

19:51.842 --> 19:55.063
And one of 'em's
still out there.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.382
Laurel's new place is-is great.

20:09.425 --> 20:10.861
It's really charming.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.167
So, smaller than a closet,

20:12.211 --> 20:13.647
louder than a rock concert?

20:13.690 --> 20:14.865
That's right.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.040
Really has that New York...

20:16.084 --> 20:17.694
feel.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.261
Hey, nothing in the evidence

20:19.305 --> 20:21.002
to identify the second killer?

20:21.045 --> 20:22.090
No.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.874
Sebastian ran
everything collected

20:23.918 --> 20:26.790
at the time for DNA
but didn't get any hits.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.096
Yeah, well, maybe...

20:28.139 --> 20:30.054
Hank Griffin...

20:30.098 --> 20:31.621
can point us

20:31.665 --> 20:32.666
to someone.

20:32.709 --> 20:33.928
Ashley's father?

20:33.971 --> 20:36.278
Yeah. He, uh,
he just got back into town.

20:36.322 --> 20:39.368
Hannah and Chris are
heading there to talk to him,

20:39.412 --> 20:41.240
see if he can tell us
who Whitman

20:41.283 --> 20:43.503
was close to
at the school. Well, if they've got

20:43.546 --> 20:45.287
a name and it's in the system,

20:45.331 --> 20:47.202
we can run it
against our forensic files.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.248
That sounds like a plan.
Thanks, Loretta.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.687
That count
as cyberstalking, or...?

20:54.949 --> 20:57.081
Dad, this is...
vetting.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.127
He's your partner.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.085
Temporary partner.

21:01.129 --> 21:04.828
Just looking out for you,
like I always do.

21:04.872 --> 21:07.962
You seem to be blushing
just a tad.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.311
Mm...

21:12.271 --> 21:14.751
If those idiot sheriffs
hadn't have blown it,

21:14.795 --> 21:16.797
he'd be sitting in a cell
right now.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.017
Everybody knew
that Elliot was guilty.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.716
You think they actually might be
able to get him this time?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.762
We don't know.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.044
And I promise you,
we'll do our best,

21:27.068 --> 21:28.417
Mr. Griffin.

21:28.461 --> 21:31.986
That snake has been
walking free...

21:32.029 --> 21:34.989
for 20 years.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.599
While my little baby's...

21:41.430 --> 21:43.389
Sorry.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.435
We read all the
original interviews,

21:46.479 --> 21:50.483
but we're trying to get a
fuller picture of Whitman.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.355
When he came to Fresh Start,

21:53.399 --> 21:55.966
he wasn't much different
than the other students.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.228
Mother was alcoholic.

21:57.272 --> 21:59.056
Father wanted nothing
to do with him.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.232
Sounds like he was dealt
a pretty rough hand.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.756
A lot of people are.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.236
That's no excuse
for bad behavior.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.021
Elliot was sneaky

22:07.064 --> 22:08.675
and manipulative.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.764
Thought he was so much smarter
than everybody else.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.176
Your school used
some rather controversial

22:12.200 --> 22:13.680
disciplinary methods.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.334
You know?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.737
Solitary confinement.
Shaved heads.

22:16.770 --> 22:17.727
Corporal punishment.

22:17.771 --> 22:18.728
When it was called for.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.034
Yes.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.079
Our job was
to turn those kids around.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.994
He have any issues with Ashley

22:24.038 --> 22:26.649
prior to her disappearance?

22:26.693 --> 22:28.651
Not that I knew of.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.566
Ashley didn't go to Fresh Start,

22:30.610 --> 22:32.220
but...

22:32.263 --> 22:33.787
she was on campus
visiting me a lot.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.286
And there would have been
plenty of opportunities

22:35.310 --> 22:36.920
for them to have interacted.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.463
Is there anyone you can
think of that Whitman

22:38.487 --> 22:40.054
was close to? No.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.969
His arrogance didn't
make him any friends

22:42.012 --> 22:43.927
with the faculty or students.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.886
Spent most of his time alone.

22:45.929 --> 22:48.671
Though I think...

22:48.715 --> 22:51.674
he talked to Parker
Lacey sometimes.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.197
Who's Parker Lacey?

22:53.241 --> 22:56.070
He was Elliot's peer mentor
when he first arrived

22:56.113 --> 22:57.463
and one of our success stories.

22:57.506 --> 22:58.464
The program

22:58.507 --> 23:00.466
really worked for Parker.

23:00.509 --> 23:03.120
Was he at the school
when Ashley disappeared?

23:03.164 --> 23:05.949
No, he graduated a
couple years earlier.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.561
But Parker always kept
in touch with Elliot.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.780
I was impressed by that,

23:10.824 --> 23:12.628
because the two of 'em couldn't
have been more different.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.305
What do you mean?

23:14.349 --> 23:16.307
Elliot was antisocial.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.571
Always had his head
in a computer.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.094
And Parker,

23:20.137 --> 23:21.443
he was popular with everybody.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.315
He was a hell
of an athlete, too.

23:24.359 --> 23:27.275
He happen to play baseball?

23:27.318 --> 23:30.626
Actually, he was captain
of the school team.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.065
So, this Parker Lacey
went to Fresh Start

23:35.109 --> 23:37.067
for anger management issues.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.722
Got into a lot of fights
at his old school.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.814
Lives in Cincinnati with
his wife and two kids.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.207
He's never been arrested.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.861
What's your problem?

23:49.166 --> 23:51.908
I'm thinking of applying to...

23:51.952 --> 23:53.606
be a part of the REACT team.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.042
Really?

23:55.085 --> 23:57.131
Yeah. Yeah.Huh.

23:57.174 --> 24:00.090
Well, I'm thinking of applying
to the Royal Ballet.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.136
Maybe we'll both get lucky.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.795
Nugget.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.492
Wait, you're serious?

24:10.536 --> 24:11.580
Yeah.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.016
I'm sorry.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.584
Never thought...

24:15.628 --> 24:17.412
Well, never mind.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.196
REACT? Really?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.720
What? Why?

24:20.763 --> 24:22.504
Why does everyone
respond like that?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.724
You got to admit,
it's a little unexpected.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.421
Yeah, well, I've been growing

24:26.465 --> 24:28.379
as a field agent
the last two years.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.077
I mean... And you're great,

24:30.120 --> 24:31.271
but REACT is on a
whole other level.

24:31.295 --> 24:32.732
Like, why the sudden interest?

24:32.775 --> 24:34.429
I don't know.
I guess, uh, sometimes,

24:34.473 --> 24:36.170
I just feel like I'm the...

24:36.213 --> 24:37.432
little brother.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.652
You know? Like I'm this geek
that's surrounded

24:39.695 --> 24:41.238
by all these people
with all this experience.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.587
I just...
I want to be able to stand

24:42.611 --> 24:44.395
on my own two feet. You know how
much we love

24:44.439 --> 24:45.745
and respect you, right?

24:45.788 --> 24:47.588
You don't have to prove
anything to any of us.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.793
It's Pride.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.273
Hey.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.449
Hey. Looking good, Brooklyn.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.190
Bite me, Jersey.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.452
What's up?

24:57.496 --> 25:00.237
Cincinnati cops
bringing Lacey or what?

25:00.281 --> 25:01.911
Went by his home and office,
but he's gone.

25:01.935 --> 25:04.198
Wife said he took off
for a fishing trip.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.765
Supposedly unreachable.

25:05.808 --> 25:07.288
That's convenient.Yeah.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.769
Well, we have something
that might help.

25:09.812 --> 25:12.206
Parker Lacey works
as an energy consultant

25:12.249 --> 25:13.488
for a lot of municipal
government agencies.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.948
Means a lot of his travel

25:14.991 --> 25:16.297
is a matter of public record.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.428
Right, so,

25:17.472 --> 25:18.580
here are
the four murders we found

25:18.604 --> 25:19.779
that match the M.O.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.650
but for which Whitman
has alibis.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.870
And here are the cities

25:23.913 --> 25:25.108
where Parker Lacey was working

25:25.132 --> 25:26.873
at the time those murders
were committed.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.309
All close enough to drive.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.528
That's good work.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.441
There's more.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.095
No wonder you love these guys.

25:32.139 --> 25:34.097
Thank you.
So, the woman

25:34.141 --> 25:36.752
who was killed in Mississippi
was married

25:36.796 --> 25:38.034
to a systems manager that worked

25:38.058 --> 25:40.103
at the same company
as Elliot Whitman.

25:40.147 --> 25:42.105
Yeah, turns out
that the husband fired Whitman

25:42.149 --> 25:44.151
four months
before his wife was killed.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.370
One of 'em feels wronged,
the other one gets even?

25:46.414 --> 25:48.479
Yeah, and whichever one has
a connection to the victim,

25:48.503 --> 25:50.897
that's the one who has
a solid alibi for the murder.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.203
But they didn't kill the
husband... they killed his wife.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.249
No, but you had to see
this poor guy on the news

25:55.292 --> 25:56.705
when she went missing.
He was a mess.

25:56.729 --> 25:59.035
Which is exactly what
Whitman and Lacey intended.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.602
They enjoy

26:00.646 --> 26:03.431
making their real
targets suffer.

26:03.474 --> 26:07.261
That's why they keep the victims
alive for several days.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.864
Means Ashley wasn't
the original target.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.526
Her father was.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.832
All right.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.529
Keep digging into Lacey.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.922
See if we can track him down.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.967
All right. All right.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.843
These two are sick.

26:23.886 --> 26:26.715
They probably get off on the
planning and the anticipation

26:26.759 --> 26:27.847
as much as the killing.

26:27.890 --> 26:30.893
Why hasn't Whitman asked
for a lawyer?

26:30.937 --> 26:32.503
He said

26:32.547 --> 26:36.029
he didn't need one
because he's innocent.

26:36.072 --> 26:39.510
Maybe because he wants
to be in custody.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.643
Perfect alibi

26:41.687 --> 26:44.298
when another murder happens
with the same M.O.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.648
Yeah. Worked for 'em
every time before.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.390
It's why we can't find Lacey.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.653
That bastard's taking
another victim.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.350
Where is she, Whitman?

26:53.394 --> 26:55.309
Hmm?

26:55.352 --> 26:56.310
Who?

26:56.353 --> 26:57.311
You know damn well who.

26:57.354 --> 26:58.965
Nadine Schiff.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.507
Your neighbor's daughter.
Same neighbor

27:00.531 --> 27:02.533
that complained about you
to building management.

27:02.577 --> 27:03.883
That piss you off? Huh?

27:03.926 --> 27:05.145
That why you went after her?

27:05.188 --> 27:06.537
I'm confused.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.409
Did something happen to Nadine?

27:08.452 --> 27:10.454
We just got word she never
made it home last night.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.717
Oh.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.675
That doesn't sound good.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.677
But I've been right here
with you.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.592
You son of a bitch.
If Lacey hurts her, I...

27:17.636 --> 27:19.159
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.030
Don't give him the satisfaction.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.817
Lacey?

27:28.472 --> 27:32.694
I knew a-a Parker Lacey
back in high school.

27:32.738 --> 27:36.176
Haven't spoken
in almost 20 years, though.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.178
But I'm happy to hear
that you've identified

27:38.221 --> 27:39.701
the real killer.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.661
Does that mean that you're
gonna be letting me go now?

27:54.194 --> 27:55.717
Pride.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.026
I got Parker Lacey's photo
to every cop in the state.

28:00.069 --> 28:02.593
I just heard Nadine Schiff's
car was found abandoned

28:02.637 --> 28:04.291
outside the city.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.422
Yeah. CSU's on the way.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.598
See if they can recover
anything useful.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.383
She could already be dead.

28:09.426 --> 28:10.776
I don't think so.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.429
To get Whitman in the clear,

28:12.473 --> 28:15.955
they need to stick
to the established M.O.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.739
Right? Keep her
alive for a while.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.349
But he could be
hiding her anywhere.

28:19.393 --> 28:22.483
Not easy to hide victims
the way they've managed to

28:22.526 --> 28:24.006
over the years.

28:24.050 --> 28:27.444
Especially not with everyone
on high alert looking for 'em.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.577
But they did it

28:29.620 --> 28:33.102
at least eight times
that we know about.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.540
Lacey works

28:36.584 --> 28:38.368
as an energy consultant.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.066
Perfect cover for travel.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.721
Bet it also allows him access
to restricted information.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.941
Maps of utility buildings,

28:45.985 --> 28:47.638
pipe and tunnel networks.

28:47.682 --> 28:50.554
New York has hundreds of miles
of utility tunnels.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.687
If he's got Nadine down there,
we'll never find her.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.212
Get in touch with Con Ed
and any other utility companies.

28:56.256 --> 28:59.433
Have 'em check
for security breaches.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.478
I'll have my team look into

29:01.522 --> 29:03.437
Lacey's work history,

29:03.480 --> 29:06.092
see if they can find anything.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.007
I'm beginning to understand why

29:08.050 --> 29:10.400
your Sheriff McTeague beat
the hell out of this guy.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.860
Any luck narrowing down where
Lacey might be hiding Nadine?

29:15.884 --> 29:17.364
Not yet.
I got his credentials,

29:17.407 --> 29:18.776
but he hasn't accessed
anything compromising.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.758
Keep looking.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.585
Nadine's running out of time.

29:21.629 --> 29:22.717
Hey. Brianna's sister has

29:22.761 --> 29:23.999
a picture of her wearing
the bracelet.

29:24.023 --> 29:24.980
Get us a copy of it.

29:25.024 --> 29:26.416
Can you e-mail me that photo?

29:26.460 --> 29:27.548
It'd be really helpful.

29:27.591 --> 29:28.941
Thank you.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.508
That the bracelet they found
in Whitman's apartment?

29:31.552 --> 29:34.120
Yep. Just got confirmation
it belongs to Brianna Robbins.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.686
She have any connection
to Lacey?

29:35.730 --> 29:37.099
Yeah. Brianna's
boyfriend at the time

29:37.123 --> 29:38.428
went to college with him.

29:38.472 --> 29:39.734
Evidently, he replaced Lacey

29:39.778 --> 29:41.997
as starting pitcher
on the school team.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.738
So they killed
the dude's girlfriend?

29:44.783 --> 29:47.655
Man, we got to nail these punks.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.268
I got it, Roy, thanks.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.923
Will,

29:54.967 --> 29:55.924
what's going on?

29:55.968 --> 29:57.665
Where's your mom?

29:57.708 --> 29:58.666
She's not here.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.581
I just came to talk to you.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.758
Well, we can talk.

30:03.802 --> 30:04.759
Let's go back here.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.630
Come on.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.853
What's up?

30:14.595 --> 30:16.771
Hey, whatever you got to say,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.165
you can trust me.

30:19.208 --> 30:22.081
Cade disappearing...

30:23.647 --> 30:25.258
I think it was my fault.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.697
I'm listening.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.482
I was just trying
to make some money.

30:32.526 --> 30:33.788
You know?

30:33.832 --> 30:36.443
So I started
delivering packages.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.662
Drugs.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.013
I didn't take any or anything.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.015
I was just picking 'em up
and dropping 'em off.

30:43.058 --> 30:44.625
You get into some kind
of trouble?

30:45.669 --> 30:47.715
My backpack got stolen.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.587
It had one of the
packages in it.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.720
Said I owed them $10,000.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.853
You tell Cade about this?

30:54.896 --> 30:57.594
He said he'd help, you know,
that he'd make things right.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.205
Then he put us in the motel.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.989
He never came back.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.710
Con Ed doesn't have security
cameras in most of the tunnels.

31:06.734 --> 31:09.606
But we got uniforms checking
as many access points as we can.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.783
You find something, Hannah?

31:12.827 --> 31:14.133
Well, Sebastian did.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.893
Lacey's way too smart
to use his company I.D.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.701
for anything related
to the murder, right?

31:17.745 --> 31:21.096
So I checked for I.D.s that
didaccess that information,

31:21.140 --> 31:22.552
the cities
where the murders took place

31:22.576 --> 31:24.621
during those time frames,
and one popped.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.797
But that I.D. doesn't seem
to belong to a real person.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.799
Lacey created it.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.671
The last time the I.D. was used

31:30.714 --> 31:32.803
was yesterday morning. It...

31:32.847 --> 31:34.216
it accessed a New York
tunnel system in Midtown.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.330
All right, send me
the exact location, Sebastian.

31:37.373 --> 31:38.722
He's in Midtown.

31:38.766 --> 31:39.723
We need to roll.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.116
Everybody, let's go!

31:42.770 --> 31:45.512
Con Ed said there are seven
other secured entrances

31:45.555 --> 31:47.514
in the schematics Lacey pulled.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.535
Gonna need the rest
of 'em opened. Already happening.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.537
We have teams searching the
tunnels from every entrance.

31:51.561 --> 31:52.780
Make sure everyone's advised

31:52.823 --> 31:54.782
that we need
to take Lacey alive.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.455
If we don't get 'em
to turn on each other,

31:56.479 --> 31:57.959
Whitman could still walk free.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.787
Thank you.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.024
Hey.

32:23.898 --> 32:25.769
Don't. No.

32:25.813 --> 32:27.573
Please don't.It's okay if you
want to scream.

32:28.598 --> 32:29.773
Be as loud as you want.

32:31.906 --> 32:33.647
No! NCIS! Drop it, Lacey!

32:33.690 --> 32:34.690
Back away!

32:38.173 --> 32:41.002
Stay with her!

32:41.046 --> 32:42.438
Hey. Okay, I'm gonna get you

32:42.482 --> 32:43.744
out of here.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.800
NCIS! Stop!

33:24.872 --> 33:27.396
Out of the way!
Federal agent!

33:27.440 --> 33:28.876
Get out of the way!

33:38.103 --> 33:39.626
Get out of the way!

33:42.846 --> 33:43.846
Watch it, buddy.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.059
So, Whitman's gonna walk.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.148
He's not out yet.

34:23.190 --> 34:24.931
He'll insist it was all Lacey.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.978
And with Lacey dead, there's
no one to contradict him.

34:28.022 --> 34:29.893
If only I caught up
to him sooner.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.721
You do this a lot, don't you?

34:33.158 --> 34:35.136
Beat yourself up over things
you have no control of?

34:35.159 --> 34:37.771
Give it 20 years, kid.

34:37.813 --> 34:39.947
Imagine by then,

34:39.989 --> 34:41.775
a good cop like you
will have plenty

34:41.818 --> 34:43.777
to beat yourself up over.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.563
We know the bracelet belonged

34:47.607 --> 34:49.130
to Brianna Robbins of Nashville.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.176
My team connected
the ring from the box

34:51.219 --> 34:53.482
to Janet Sutton,
killed in Detroit.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.311
But even placing him close
to these murders,

34:56.355 --> 34:57.530
it's still circumstantial.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.923
Without a confession,
we don't have a case.

35:01.969 --> 35:04.711
Whitman doesn't know
that Lacey's dead yet, does he?

35:04.754 --> 35:07.409
No. Soon as he does,

35:07.453 --> 35:09.281
figure he'll finally ask
for that lawyer.

35:11.544 --> 35:14.068
Get Whitman back up
in interrogation.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.115
I need to talk to him again...
alone.

35:34.610 --> 35:37.178
Have you found poor Nadine yet?

35:37.222 --> 35:39.398
In fact, we did.

35:39.441 --> 35:40.573
She's with her mother now.

35:40.616 --> 35:43.228
She's okay?

35:43.271 --> 35:45.447
Mm-hmm. Well, that's...

35:45.491 --> 35:48.102
It's good news. Yeah, even better news

35:48.146 --> 35:51.279
is that we got Parker Lacey
in custody now.

35:51.323 --> 35:55.718
He says that you believe that

35:55.762 --> 35:58.025
the two of you are good friends?

35:58.068 --> 36:00.027
We are. Uh, were...

36:00.070 --> 36:02.160
back when I knew him.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.249
Well, I-I'm afraid
he doesn't have much nice

36:04.292 --> 36:05.859
to say about you now.

36:05.902 --> 36:08.209
Word he used was

36:08.253 --> 36:10.385
"pathetic."

36:12.735 --> 36:14.694
Parker would never call me that.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.565
According to Lacey,
this friendship

36:16.609 --> 36:18.611
was all in your head.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.832
You were just a lonely kid,

36:22.876 --> 36:26.227
maybe a little bit
obsessed with him?

36:26.271 --> 36:30.753
Lacey says that you committed
all the murders,

36:30.797 --> 36:33.452
but he admits that he helped.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.236
He said that you threatened

36:35.280 --> 36:37.238
to kill his wife and
kids if he didn't.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.329
He wouldn't talk to you.

36:41.373 --> 36:43.592
Well, he's not like you,
Whitman.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.594
He has a life,

36:45.638 --> 36:47.466
family that-that loves him.

36:47.509 --> 36:50.251
He's throwing you under
the bus in exchange

36:50.295 --> 36:52.645
for a deal that means
that he'll get out in time

36:52.688 --> 36:55.343
to have some more good years
with them.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.434
You're lying.

36:59.478 --> 37:02.742
He gave us names, locations.

37:03.873 --> 37:06.006
Told us all about...

37:06.049 --> 37:07.834
Brianna Robbins.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.706
Evidently, her boyfriend took

37:10.750 --> 37:13.666
Lacey's spot as pitcher
on his college baseball team.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.668
When he told you about it,

37:15.711 --> 37:18.279
you killed Brianna in some

37:18.323 --> 37:21.195
twisted effort to get Parker
to like you, or...?

37:21.239 --> 37:23.676
He... he said it was my idea?

37:23.719 --> 37:25.678
Yeah. He-he told us

37:25.721 --> 37:28.724
you did it with a...
a woman in Detroit

37:28.768 --> 37:30.683
in 2010.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.728
Another desperate attempt
for his attention.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.295
Look, I never
needed his attention.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.863
We were friends,
we shared the same interests.

37:36.906 --> 37:39.518
Killing innocent people

37:39.561 --> 37:42.521
is not much
to build a friendship on.

37:45.698 --> 37:48.309
But I guess you're
learning that now.

37:50.616 --> 37:51.747
Yeah.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.706
What you got? Sorry to interrupt.

37:53.749 --> 37:56.099
Just want to let you know
the D.A.'s with Lacey now.

37:56.143 --> 37:57.710
Should be wrapping up soon.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.277
Good.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.411
You were one sick kid.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.936
Forcing him to watch you
beat Ashley like that.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.678
That's not how it happened!

38:09.722 --> 38:11.985
It was all his idea.

38:12.028 --> 38:15.641
He hated Dean Griffin
for what he did to us.

38:15.684 --> 38:18.557
And the only person
that the dean ever cared about

38:18.600 --> 38:21.299
was Saint Ashley.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.692
And so we took her from him.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.138
Hmm, I just heard from Pride.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.705
Elliot Whitman has been arrested

38:36.749 --> 38:38.359
for the murder
of Ashley Griffin.

38:38.403 --> 38:39.621
Oh, it's great news.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.144
Uh-huh. You need a hand?

38:41.188 --> 38:43.408
No, I got it.
Ah.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.801
Is everything all right?

38:45.845 --> 38:47.934
You know what?
No, it's not.

38:47.977 --> 38:51.241
I'm gonna apply to
this REACT team, okay?

38:51.285 --> 38:52.523
And I don't really
care if you think

38:52.547 --> 38:54.375
that that's a-a terrible idea.

38:54.419 --> 38:58.248
You know, my whole life, I've
been the science nerd, the geek.

38:58.292 --> 39:00.250
Which is fine. That's cool.
I love being a geek.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.600
But-but NCIS has made me realize

39:01.643 --> 39:03.689
that I can... I can be
something more, too,

39:03.732 --> 39:05.734
you know, and I want to
know if I can do this.

39:05.778 --> 39:08.694
I don't have anything to prove
to anybody other than myself.

39:08.737 --> 39:10.130
And I've been
training really hard,

39:10.173 --> 39:12.872
and I'm ready to do
this, so... there.

39:18.094 --> 39:21.533
Good, because that's
the confidence you're gonna need

39:21.576 --> 39:24.187
to get through
the application tests.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.671
You're a very sneaky
person, you know that?

39:29.715 --> 39:32.413
Can't wait to see how it goes.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.197
Good.

39:35.198 --> 39:36.635
Miss Loretta?

39:36.678 --> 39:37.940
Chris, what's wrong?

39:37.984 --> 39:39.594
It's Cade.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.597
Got some new information,
and I think he's in trouble.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.817
I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'm headed

39:44.860 --> 39:46.645
to Alabama to look into it.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.736
Nobody's heard from him in days.

39:50.779 --> 39:53.869
If it's not too much trouble,

39:53.913 --> 39:57.090
could you look
for any John Does?

39:58.134 --> 39:59.832
Uh, of course.

39:59.875 --> 40:03.401
I'll, uh, contact the coroners
and M.E.s around Mobile,

40:03.444 --> 40:06.839
see if there's anyone that
matches Cade's description.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.188
It's Pride.

40:08.231 --> 40:10.190
I'm gonna fill him in.Yeah.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.018
I'll say a prayer
for your brother.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.719
Thank you. I got a feeling
he could use it.

40:19.242 --> 40:21.244
King.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.728
Of course. Take as long
as you need.

40:26.772 --> 40:29.644
Finding your brother's
the priority.

40:29.688 --> 40:32.604
Oh, and, Chris,
take Sebastian with you.

40:32.647 --> 40:34.823
No, no, no, we'll be fine.

40:34.867 --> 40:37.739
If there's trouble,
I want you to have backup.

40:39.393 --> 40:42.048
Yeah, keep me updated.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.920
Hey, honey. Great idea.

40:44.964 --> 40:47.619
I thought we could take a walk
down to the West Village.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.230
As long as I'm with you,
I don't care where we go.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.840
You need relish?

40:51.884 --> 40:54.452
Uh, no, just mustard's fine.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.889
Hey, Pride.Hey.

40:56.932 --> 40:59.892
You want a dog? Uh...

40:59.935 --> 41:01.154
no, no, I'm okay.

41:01.197 --> 41:03.112
You don't mind
the extra company, do you?
