00:06.074 --> 00:06.974
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.142 --> 00:09.543
sexually based offenses

00:09.577 --> 00:11.479
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.115
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.148 --> 00:15.783
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.816 --> 00:17.385
are members of an elite squad

00:17.418 --> 00:19.553
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.122
These are their stories.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.124
[dramatic musical flourish]

00:23.157 --> 00:24.592
- Good morning.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.394
Hello World, it's me, Mandy.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.163
It's Friday, September 8th,
and in case you can't tell,

00:29.197 --> 00:31.065
I'm actually excited to go
to school today.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.533
It's the fall pep rally.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.668
And the first thing is
to change.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.404
[chime]
That's better.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.539
I don't know why they interrupt
school to announce

00:38.572 --> 00:40.808
sports team, especially the
football players.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.643
It's like, "We get it.
You're popular."

00:43.411 --> 00:45.813
Also, the whole rah-rah
high school thing,

00:45.846 --> 00:47.348
everyone says it's suppose to

00:47.381 --> 00:49.117
be the best four years
of your life,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.085
you know, dances and parties
and romance.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.687
I like it but, I mean,
sometimes I wonder,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.356
you know, if I'm doing
it right.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.824
I've only been a sophomore
for a week.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.526
Hopefully this year will
be different.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.728
Hey, hey. It's Tuesday,
September 19th.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.464
The day the winners of the art
competition are announced.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.300
Oh, my gosh.
Look at my parents.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.869
- We want to wish you
good luck.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.704
- So embarrassing.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.706
Well, at least my parents
love me.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.408
But what I really want is

01:14.442 --> 01:15.576
to fall in love.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.278
What I don't get is how do
you know?

01:17.311 --> 01:18.479
Like, if you feel
like you're in love,

01:18.512 --> 01:20.314
does that mean you're
in love?

01:20.348 --> 01:21.682
Isn't love just a bunch of
chemicals swooshing

01:21.715 --> 01:23.184
around in your brain?

01:23.217 --> 01:24.685
My head hurts trying
to figure it out.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.454
Hello again, internet peeps.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.655
It's me, Mandy.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.557
I'm here with Stacey

01:29.590 --> 01:31.625
and Ashley.

01:31.659 --> 01:35.396
And the Sophomore Semi-Formal
is coming up and we need dates.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.864
[upbeat music playing]

01:36.897 --> 01:39.467
I think Stacey should go
with Mark.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.403
- Totally babe-soda,
but he'd never go with me.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.605
Maybe...
[sighs] Daniel.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.874
- No, I'm not going to.
She isn't that into me.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.442
- [chuckles]

01:48.476 --> 01:51.145
- Whoo, I could so see that.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.747
Then Mandy could go
with Andrew.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.251
- Uh, no way, guys,
he's like my brother.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.887
Hey, guys.
Say "hi", Andrew.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.622
- Hi.
[laughter]

02:01.655 --> 02:03.357
- These cool kids?
They're my crew.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.260
And this is
my fun, crazy life.

Saturday night?

We just got invited to a party.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.750
Look.
[giggles]

02:29.783 --> 02:34.555
- That one text, it changed
everything.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.361
[sniffles] Hey, it's me.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.963
It's October, 16th.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.300
The worst day of my life.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.202
My reputation is ruined.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.670
And I'm done
with Wollman High,

02:49.703 --> 02:51.239
and I'm done
with my so-called friends.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.506
[mouse clicks]

02:52.540 --> 02:54.775
- When was the last time
you saw Mandy?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.577
- This morning at breakfast.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.512
She'd left for school at 8:00.
- And she never came back.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.448
We tried her cell, and it
went straight to voicemail.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.283
- And we called the school.
They said that she'd been

03:02.316 --> 03:04.685
in homeroom but not
in any classes after that.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.554
I checked her computer,

03:06.587 --> 03:08.622
found this.
- Uh, and Mrs. Fowler,

03:08.656 --> 03:11.659
you told 911 dispatch
that there were photos

03:11.692 --> 03:13.694
of a sexual nature.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.430

03:16.464 --> 03:19.567

03:19.600 --> 03:21.235
"Whore."

03:21.269 --> 03:22.903
"Skank-ass bitch."

03:22.936 --> 03:24.838
[scoffs]

03:24.872 --> 03:28.776
These were the nicer messages
that I woke up to yesterday.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.011
The rest are way worse.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.347
And this.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.752
Someone did this to me.

Whoever did this,

03:47.528 --> 03:51.932

03:51.965 --> 03:54.668
please, just tell me why.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.965
she posted this on her
blog this morning

04:57.998 --> 04:59.667
and then disappeared.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.336
The photo was being texted
by her classmates,

05:02.370 --> 05:04.505
and it was apparently taken
at a party on Saturday night.

05:04.538 --> 05:08.041
- So she's a victim
of cyberbullying, and worse.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.677
What else have we got?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.612
- Well, her last ping on her
cell was at 10:00

05:11.645 --> 05:13.481
this morning
from Wollman High.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.015
We're tracking her
cell phone records

05:15.048 --> 05:16.617
and contacting her friends,

05:16.650 --> 05:18.018
and of course she's active
on social media.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.620
- Okay.
- So we're going through

05:19.653 --> 05:21.389
all her accounts.
- And the parents are here?

05:21.422 --> 05:22.723
- Yeah and they seem loving,
supportive.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.858
There's no evidence
of family issues.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.494
Okay.
- Hey.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.661
Mandy hasn't used a debit or
credit cards.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.597
We got photos of her out at the

05:29.630 --> 05:31.365
subway stations, bus terminals.
[cell phone buzzing]

05:31.399 --> 05:32.900
- Okay, has she ever run away
before?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.602
- The parents say, "No."
She's a straight A student.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.036
She's got no trouble
with her peers.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.905
- Until this weekend.
- Hold on.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.106
TARU got her cell log.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.641
Before she powered down,

05:40.674 --> 05:42.410
she texted an Andrew Drake
ten times.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.044
- Can we get an address?
- Yeah. Upper West Side.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.446
That's two blocks
from the high school.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.614
I'm on it, Lieutenant.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.915
[both sigh]

05:47.948 --> 05:49.650
- Listen, I'm so sorry to drag
you back in here.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.385
I know you left early to be
with Noah--

05:51.419 --> 05:53.454
- No. You did the right thing.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.088
- Is everything okay at home?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.490
- Yeah.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.626
Yeah, all good. Let's, uh...

05:58.659 --> 06:00.594
Let's go talk to the parents.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.965
Mr. and Mrs. Fowler, I'm
Lieutenant Benson.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.400
- Did you find Mandy?

06:06.434 --> 06:08.168
- Not yet, but I can assure you

06:08.201 --> 06:10.070
that we're doing everything
we can.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.172
- I should have realized how
upset she was,

06:12.205 --> 06:13.474
made her talk to me.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.875
- After the party on Saturday?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.410
- She was...

06:16.444 --> 06:18.746
[sighs] so excited to go,
and..,

06:18.779 --> 06:20.648
What they did to her--I
just want to kill them.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.816
- Well, I can understand that.
So...

06:22.850 --> 06:25.085
do you know where this party
was and who was there?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.420
- At Daniel's.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.788
All Honors classmates.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.023
- Would she say anything
when she got home?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.559
- I fell asleep on the couch.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.193
When I check on her,
she was asleep.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.828
- Does Mandy have a boyfriend?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.129
Was she dating anyone?

06:36.163 --> 06:39.032
- No.
- Did she mention

06:39.066 --> 06:40.934
meeting someone online maybe?

06:40.968 --> 06:42.670
- No.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.606
Is this because of her vlog?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.441
We never should have
let her do that.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.876
- How could we stop her?
She...

06:48.909 --> 06:50.210
She was so proud of it.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.845
She had over
1,000 views last week.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.581
- Maybe one of those perverts
tracked her down.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.450
- You know, we're checking
into that.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.619
- And this Andrew Drake?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.754
Do you know if he was
at the party Saturday night?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.524
- Yes, but I can't imagine he'd
have anything to do with it.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.193
Mandy and Andrew were friends
since first grade.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.962
*

07:08.996 --> 07:10.864
- I swear, I don't know
where Mandy is.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.600
- Do you know
why she texted you

07:12.633 --> 07:14.034
ten times this morning?

07:14.067 --> 07:17.004
- No.
- No?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.940
You didn't read the texts?

07:19.973 --> 07:21.609
Okay.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.945
Listen, Andrew, I've been doing
this a long time,

07:24.978 --> 07:26.246
and I don't ask questions

07:26.279 --> 07:27.881
I don't already
know the answers to.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.983
- Okay, okay.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.685
She wanted to know why.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.053
The same thing she asked
in her vlog.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.855
- Andrew, what is this about?

07:34.888 --> 07:38.125
- Mrs. Drake, your son was
at a party where somebody...

07:38.158 --> 07:39.760
wrote some pretty awful things

07:39.793 --> 07:42.195
on an unconscious, half-naked
teenage girl.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.931
- What?
- Then they took a photo of it

07:43.964 --> 07:45.966
and texted it.
- I deleted that picture.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.000
- Well who took the photo?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.902
- I don't know.

07:48.936 --> 07:52.540
Everybody thinks that Mandy and
I are--are so tight,

07:52.573 --> 07:55.943
that I know what's going
on with her, but I don't.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.111
- What do you know, Andrew?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.013
- Mandy and her best friends.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.849
They gossip all the time.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.150
You should talk to them.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.652
- Any friend in particular?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.787
- Stacey Vanhoven,
Mandy's bestie.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.122
They had their heads together
all morning.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.291
Intense, like arguing.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.994
- Arguing about what?
- I don't know.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.096
But I heard Mandy say,

08:16.129 --> 08:19.032
"You aren't my friend anymore."

08:19.066 --> 08:20.768
[door knocks, opens]

08:20.801 --> 08:22.202
- Stacey.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.172
This detective wants to ask
you about Mandy Fowler.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.874
- Oh, my God, did you find her?

08:26.907 --> 08:30.110
- Not yet, but we would like
to ask you a few questions.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.945
- Yeah, um,

08:31.979 --> 08:33.113
Dad, I got this.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.015
- You sure?
- Yeah.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.986
- You and Mandy were pretty
close, right?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.154
- Yeah.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.824
Best friends since...
forever.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.626
- So it must have hurt
when she told you

08:45.659 --> 08:47.861
she didn't want to be
your friend anymore.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.063
[tense music]

08:50.097 --> 08:52.032
We know you two got
in a fight this morning.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.868
What was that about?
- I can't tell anyone.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.737
She said she would never talk
to me again.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.739
- Do you know who drew on her
on Saturday night?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.974
Who took the photo?
- No.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.143
I left the party early.
[sighs]

09:03.176 --> 09:04.845
- Then what do you know?

09:04.878 --> 09:08.616
*

09:08.649 --> 09:10.618
She's been humiliated.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.253
She's probably angry.
She's probably scared to death.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.788
She's out there all alone,

09:14.822 --> 09:17.224
and she could be
in serious trouble, Stacey.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.860
- [sighs]
She's not alone.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.295
- Who is she with?

09:22.329 --> 09:25.365
- [exhales]

09:25.398 --> 09:26.967
- Got something?
- Yeah, it turns out

09:27.000 --> 09:29.236
Mandy was in contact
with some guy online

09:29.269 --> 09:30.871
through ChatSlam.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.874
It was hidden behind an app
on her desktop

09:33.907 --> 09:35.275
which is why her parents
didn't know.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.977
- ChatSlam?
- Yeah.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.846
It's a social media
app, and it's untraceable.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.781
It deletes conversations
in seconds.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.983
- So Mandy didn't want a record
of whoever she was talking to.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.985
- So can we tell if it was one
of her vlog followers?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.286
- Well the only thing
I've got so far

09:46.319 --> 09:47.888
is that it was chat connection

09:47.921 --> 09:49.389
between her and
"Ethan E-ManWomanHatr"

09:49.422 --> 09:51.024
from Newark at 9:00 a.m.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.626
TARU's trying to recover
the conversation.

[computer dings]

09:53.927 --> 09:56.129
Wait, hold up.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.965
Mandy's going live on Facebook.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.900
- TARU's tracing the social
media, right?

09:59.933 --> 10:02.770
- Yeah, yeah, all of them,
Instagram, YouTube, Twitter.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.906
- Carisi, SVU.
Mandy Fowler.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.941
Yeah, she's online right now.
- It's right there, go.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.678
[tense music]

10:10.711 --> 10:13.781
- It's me, Mandy.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.182
- Oh, my God, look at her.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.717
- To all of you haters
out there.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.851
I'm in a better place.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.252
- Okay, keep talking, honey.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.921
Let us figure out
where you are.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.189
Keep talking, keep talking.
- I'm better off

10:22.222 --> 10:23.857
without my fake friends.

10:23.891 --> 10:27.928
Their silence cuts deeper
than words.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.664
Mom, Dad,

10:30.698 --> 10:33.333
I'm sorry, I can't come back.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.268
- No, Mandy, hold on, hold on,
sweetie.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.269
Don't sign off.
- Goodbye.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.905
- TARU's got it.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.306
It's an IP address in Newark,
New Jersey.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.008
- Great work.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.880
[sirens wailing]

- The name on the account is
Ethan Cohen.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.727
It's apartment 223.
- This doesn't look good.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.729
[radio chatter]

11:01.762 --> 11:03.196
- NYPD, open up.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.701
- Ethan, we have a warrant.

[dramatic music]

11:14.174 --> 11:15.709
- Where's Mandy Fowler?

11:15.743 --> 11:16.944
- I didn't do anything to her.
- Yeah.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.079
- Where is she?
- Mandy.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.380
- She's okay, she's fine.

11:20.413 --> 11:24.752
- Mandy. We're NYPD.
Are you okay?

11:24.785 --> 11:27.254
- Ethan, I trusted you.
- I didn't call the cops.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.823
- Mandy, it's okay, we're here
to take you home.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.491
- I'm not going with you.
I live here.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.261
- Sweetheart, you're 15 years
old, that's not gonna happen.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.363
Let's go.
- Just tell them, Mandy.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.366
- Tell us what?

11:39.399 --> 11:41.401
- That party...

11:41.434 --> 11:44.872
Those ass-hat high school boys.

11:44.905 --> 11:48.108
They did more than just draw
on her with a sharpie.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.343
*

11:50.377 --> 11:53.146
She was raped.

*

12:02.055 --> 12:02.189
.

12:02.222 --> 12:02.823
- I couldn't tell my parents.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.126
They'd be so ashamed of me.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.996
- Mandy, your parents know
that this wasn't your fault.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.865
- You told Ethan
that you were raped?

12:11.899 --> 12:14.401
Can you help us understand
what happened?

12:14.434 --> 12:17.337
- I don't remember.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.339
I'd smoked a joint.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.209
I never do that.
- That's okay.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.544
That has nothing to do
with this.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.279
- [sniffles]

12:26.313 --> 12:29.082
The whole school thinks
that I'm a slut.

[somber music]

12:31.318 --> 12:33.553
My reputation is ruined
forever.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.155
- Mandy, listen to me.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.324
We are gonna figure out
who did this to you,

12:37.357 --> 12:40.060
and we're going to help
you fight back.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.362
- I just want to know who,
and why.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.131
- Look.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.166
You smoked a joint so you were
a little high, right?

12:46.199 --> 12:48.401
Your memory's foggy,
that can happen.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.172
So why don't we--why don't we
start by you telling us

12:52.205 --> 12:56.343
what's the last thing
that you do remember?

12:58.211 --> 13:00.447
- I somehow got into a cab.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.582
And I made it home, and I pass
out on my bed.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.184
- Okay.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.253
- And when I woke up,

13:06.286 --> 13:08.555
I saw the black marker
on my body.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.024
*

13:11.058 --> 13:15.062
And that was sore, down there.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.464
I was bleeding.

13:17.497 --> 13:21.835
- Do you remember consenting
to sex?

13:21.869 --> 13:25.005
- No...I don't.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.074
- Hm.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.977
*

13:30.010 --> 13:33.113

- Yeah, it is for us.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.021
[school bell rings]

13:41.054 --> 13:43.023
- I didn't know Daniel was
having a party.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.391
He's banned from Xbox

13:44.424 --> 13:46.126
for the rest of the year,
believe you me.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.560
- I didn't do that to Mandy,

13:47.594 --> 13:49.196
draw on her.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.398
- Well, somebody did.
Who else was there?

13:53.266 --> 13:55.268
- I'm not sure.
- Did I raise an idiot?

13:55.302 --> 13:57.104
We live in a doorman building.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.505
There are cameras
in the elevator.

13:58.538 --> 14:02.009
We're cooperating here,
right, Daniel?

14:02.042 --> 14:05.412
- Stacey, Mandy, me...

14:05.445 --> 14:06.646
Max and Andrew.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.282
- Just you three guys?

14:09.316 --> 14:10.918
Okay, that narrows it down.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.385
- Narrows what down?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.121
I mean, the kids were just
smoking some pot.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.488
Okay, and they drew
on that girl, but...

14:15.522 --> 14:16.990
it's just a prank, right?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.325
Nothing I wouldn't do
as a teenager.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.994
- It's more than a prank,
Mr. Ross.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.030
Mandy says she was raped.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.534
- Not by me.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.102
- By who?

14:29.136 --> 14:30.370
- I didn't rape Mandy Fowler.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.105
- Well, which one
of your buddies did?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.640
- None of them.
- Your buddy, Daniel,

14:33.673 --> 14:36.043
he told us that you're the one
that drew on Mandy.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.577
- And you believe
this other kid?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.046
- Dad.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.914
It was just a joke.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.515
- Did you take
the pictures too, Max?

14:45.052 --> 14:46.586
Hey, we have your phone.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.257
- I deleted them.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.526
- You know with technology
that stuff never goes away.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.328
- I told those guys
to cut it out,

14:55.362 --> 14:56.563
to leave Mandy alone.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.165
- Okay, so, um...

14:58.198 --> 15:00.333
When you told me yesterday,

15:00.367 --> 15:02.302
that you didn't know
who drew on her,

15:02.335 --> 15:04.204
you didn't know
who took the photos,

15:04.237 --> 15:05.638
you were lying.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.274
- I didn't want anyone to get
in trouble.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.541
- But now you're telling
us the truth?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.010
- Yeah.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.112
- How did Mandy get half
undressed?

15:12.145 --> 15:13.981
- It must have been Max.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.415
- Must have been Max.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.050
Must have been. You don't know?

15:17.084 --> 15:18.485
- No.
- Stacey had left

15:18.518 --> 15:21.054
at this point so it was just
the four of you.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.622
- Right.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.958
- Hey, Andrew.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.427
Were you ever alone with Mandy?

15:29.496 --> 15:31.331
Remember I told you
I don't ask questions

15:31.364 --> 15:33.600
I don't already know
the answers to.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.168
- Okay, yes.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.970
I was alone with her,

15:37.004 --> 15:38.438
but just for a few minutes.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.474
- You touch her?
- Is that what she said?

15:41.508 --> 15:44.411
- Let's focus on
what you're going to say.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.147
What really happened, Andrew.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.683
[tense music]

15:50.717 --> 15:52.119
- I kissed her.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.354
But that's all.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.556
- Okay, how did she respond?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.091
- She liked it.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.461
But she was too high,
and so I left.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.363
And those guys started messing
with her.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.598
I told them to stop.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.300
- So the kid who drew on her
and took the picture

16:07.334 --> 16:09.102
admits to taking the picture.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.603
- And the kid who gave her pot
admits to giving her pot.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.771
- And the third kid admits
to--what?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.373
A few innocent kisses?

16:13.406 --> 16:14.774
- Yeah, so admit
what you can't deny,

16:14.807 --> 16:16.243
deny what you
can't admit.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.245
- And no one's admitting
to the rape.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.679
Anything from the kit?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.648
- There's no DNA.
There's genital trauma,

16:21.681 --> 16:24.417
bleeding, bruising, all
consistent with sexual assault.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.519
- So one
of these boys is guilty.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.255
It's like playing
three card monte.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.424
- Yeah.
- Who has the most to lose?

16:31.458 --> 16:34.661
- I'd say the kid who took the
picture of a half-naked

16:34.694 --> 16:39.166
15 year old girl and texted
them to everyone in the school.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.170
- You can't be serious. Federal
child pornography charges?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.738
- Yeah, we are very serious.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.374
- God, this is--this is bad.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.176
- Yeah, and it's gonna get
worse unless

16:49.209 --> 16:52.179
you give us a play by play.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.346
- I'm no rat.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.516
- Max, for God sakes.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.252
- Do you know who assaulted
Mandy Fowler?

16:59.286 --> 17:02.089
*

17:02.122 --> 17:04.291
- Oh, my God, it was Andrew?

17:04.324 --> 17:06.459
Are you sure it was Andrew?

17:06.493 --> 17:08.461
- The other two boys
corroborate

17:08.495 --> 17:12.365
that he was only one
that was alone with you.

17:12.399 --> 17:16.736
- What does he say?
- He admits to kissing you.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.239
Do you remember that?

17:22.175 --> 17:24.477
- A little.

17:24.511 --> 17:28.581
But I didn't want him to.
I don't like him that way.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.350
Why would I?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.152
He was my friend.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.553
Did he draw on me, too?
Take photos?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.456
- No, that was--that was
the other two boys.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.226
I'm sorry.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.161
- All three of them.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.763
All three of them did
that to me?

17:45.365 --> 17:46.866
- So what happens now?

17:46.899 --> 17:51.104
- Well, we are going
to arrest all three boys.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.505
And...

17:52.539 --> 17:55.208
let them know that there are
serious consequences

17:55.242 --> 17:57.144
to what they did and...

17:57.177 --> 17:58.378
we're going to let the school

17:58.411 --> 18:00.747
and everyone in it know
as well.

18:00.780 --> 18:04.384
*

18:04.417 --> 18:06.353
- Everyone, your attention.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.356
- Daniel Ross, Max Rivera,
stand up.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.624
- You're under arrest
for reckless endangerment,

18:11.658 --> 18:13.726
endangering the welfare
of a child,

18:13.760 --> 18:17.230
and disseminating indecent
material to minors.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.798
- Andrew Drake, stand up.

18:18.831 --> 18:22.435
You are under arrest for rape
in the second degree.

[dramatic music]

18:24.404 --> 18:27.374

- Settle down, everyone.

18:33.680 --> 18:33.846
.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.714
- You arrest him in front
of his classmates.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.649
He's 16.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.151
- Mandy Fowler's 15.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.719
And we're taking
this very seriously.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.421
- Do we need a lawyer?
- That's your right,

18:41.454 --> 18:43.623
but this is Andrew's chance
to tell us his side.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.691
- Yeah, Mom, I want to explain.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.259
- Okay, great.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.460
Go ahead.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.562
- Okay, um...

18:49.596 --> 18:51.331
We smoked a joint.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.866
Um, Mandy was bugged out from
being too high

18:53.900 --> 18:55.768
so I took her to the study
to calm her down.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.537
- And it was just the
two of you?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.539
- Yeah. Uh, we talked.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.474
She started feeling better.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.343
Then we started kissing.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.711
- Wait.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.480
She kissed you or was it you
that kissed her?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.249
- I kissed her.
- Hm.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.585
- Okay, good,
then what--what happened?

19:12.619 --> 19:14.587
- Then we start making out.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.489
I felt like she...

19:16.523 --> 19:18.858
liked it.
- Mm-hmm.

19:18.891 --> 19:22.862
- And you know,
one thing led to...

19:22.895 --> 19:24.897
you know.
- Well, yeah, I know, but

19:24.931 --> 19:27.500
we need to hear you say it,
Andrew.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.937
[tense music]

19:30.970 --> 19:34.207
- We had sex.
- Okay. Good, good.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.243
Look, I know this isn't easy,
but earlier you said

19:36.276 --> 19:39.646
that you two just kissed,
and now you're saying

19:39.679 --> 19:41.448
you had sex.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.649
- Yeah.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.417
But it was consensual.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.387
- Did you hear her say, "Yes"?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.855
- Not exactly.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.323
- Okay, Andrew, stop.
- No, no.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.858
She--she wanted it.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.227
I mean, her eyes were closed,
but she was smiling.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.763
- Smiling? Okay.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.732
Andrew, why do you think
you're here?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.601
- Well, I know Mandy
must be mad

20:01.634 --> 20:04.404
about the markers and the
photos, but I didn't do that.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.472
Did you tell her?

20:05.505 --> 20:07.774
- Yeah, we did.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.742
- So the sex...

20:09.776 --> 20:10.910
Is she--is she saying
she regretted it?

20:10.943 --> 20:12.379
- The only thing she's saying

20:12.412 --> 20:13.746
is that she doesn't
remember it.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.248
The only thing she remembers is

20:15.282 --> 20:16.683
that she didn't want
to kiss you,

20:16.716 --> 20:17.817
that it was like kissing
her brother.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.552
- No, that's not true.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.354
She liked it.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.022
I didn't do anything wrong.
- Here's what I don't get,

20:23.055 --> 20:24.391
Andrew.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.259
If the sex was consensual

20:26.293 --> 20:27.794
then why didn't you just tell
us that in the first place.

20:27.827 --> 20:28.895
- I wanted to protect her
reputation.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.330
- Stop talking, Andrew.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.531
No more questions
without a lawyer.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.799
- Okay, that's fine,

20:32.832 --> 20:34.567
but I got to tell you,
Ms. Drake.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.570
Your son's already given us all
the answers we need.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.940
*

20:40.973 --> 20:43.743
[door opens]
- What?

20:43.776 --> 20:44.977
- We got a message
from the VINE service,

20:45.011 --> 20:46.813
Andrew's out on bail?
- Yes.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.415
But there's an automatic order
of protection in place,

20:48.448 --> 20:51.318
and the court doesn't think
that he is a risk

20:51.351 --> 20:53.286
or a danger to Mandy
or your family.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.588
- Well, maybe he's not
but the kids at school are.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.023
Bruce's car was spray-painted.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.025
We had a brick thrown
through our window.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.860
Mandy's been getting
threatening messages.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.462
- Okay, you know what, we can
put a patrol car

21:02.495 --> 21:03.796
on your block,

21:03.830 --> 21:05.898
and as for now, Mandy, it
might be a--

21:05.932 --> 21:07.567
It might be a good time
to lay off

21:07.600 --> 21:09.302
the social media
for a while.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.604
- Yeah, I guess.

21:11.638 --> 21:12.972
- You know what, why don't--

21:13.005 --> 21:14.807
Why don't we sit down,
let's just...

21:14.841 --> 21:17.744
Go through the next steps,
okay?

21:21.013 --> 21:23.316
Mandy, it's really important...

21:23.350 --> 21:25.785
that you don't communicate
with Andrew anymore

21:25.818 --> 21:27.754
or anyone about the case.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.988
- What about the
other two boys?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.857
- Well, they're going to plead

21:30.890 --> 21:32.859
to reckless endangerment in
exchange for testifying.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.394
- Do I have to testify?

21:34.427 --> 21:35.628
- No, of course, you have
to testify.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.063
- Well, actually,

21:37.096 --> 21:39.399
it's Mandy's
decision ultimately, and...

21:39.432 --> 21:41.100
You know, and if this does
go to trial--

21:41.133 --> 21:42.835
- The kids at school hate
me enough.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.437
They think I'm a liar.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.606
They trashed my locker.
- I'm so sorry.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.074
I can't imagine how difficult

21:48.107 --> 21:50.009
this has been.
- I can never go back.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.679
Everyone's blaming me
for taking down Andrew

21:52.712 --> 21:53.880
and Daniel and Max.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.415
Me. Not them.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.883
- Honey--
- If you don't believe me

21:56.916 --> 21:58.818
just search twitter
for #FreeAndrew.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.387
- Of course, of course,
we believe you.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.788
- Your true friends know
what's right.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.657
- I don't have any friends.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.527
Stacey won't even call me back.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.698
- You know what, there
is still a chance

22:11.731 --> 22:15.468
that the DA's office can reach
a plea agreement with Andrew.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.637
- Wait, wait, wait, don't we
get a say in that?

22:17.670 --> 22:19.472
- Yes.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.774
But the goal is holding Andrew
accountable for what he did,

22:21.808 --> 22:26.546
and if we can do that while
sparing Mandy from testifying,

22:26.579 --> 22:27.814
I think that's the answer.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.383
- I don't want to testify.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.784
- She'll testify.

22:31.818 --> 22:39.025
*

22:41.894 --> 22:43.763
- We'll plead to forcible
touching.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.398
- I'm not impressed,
Mr. Guthrie.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.966
- I don't think the jury will
be impressed

22:46.999 --> 22:49.669
by a vic that was too high
to ID my client

22:49.702 --> 22:52.872
and testimony of
co-conspirators who cut a deal.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.941
- In the interest
in sparing Mandy a trial

22:54.974 --> 22:56.409
I'll drop to the E Felony.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.077
No jail time, six years
probation and--

22:58.110 --> 23:00.947
- No way, he's not going
on the registry for this.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.682
- It's a sexual offense.
It's mandatory.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.651
Rape Three, that's
my final offer.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.686
- Look, wait, check this out.
- Thanks, but no thanks.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.755
- Well, this is all going away,
anyway, Mr. Barba.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.590
Mandy's not going to testify.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.924
- That's not what she told me.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.926
- She's telling the world
on her vlog.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.695
- I just don't care.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.829
No more police.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.731
No lawyer, no more trials,

23:18.765 --> 23:20.433
no more being the victim.

23:20.467 --> 23:23.503
And I feel great
because I've figured out

23:23.536 --> 23:25.672
that you can change the past.

23:25.705 --> 23:28.808
I have the power, and I've
decided whatever happened,

23:28.841 --> 23:31.143
it's done. It's over.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.446
It doesn't matter because
I'm not that girl,

23:33.480 --> 23:35.982
and I'm never going to be
that girl again.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.950
- She's talking about making a
change...

23:37.984 --> 23:40.086
- Hair is different.
There's no nose ring.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.521
Look, she cleaned her room.

23:41.554 --> 23:43.456
She took down the family
photos.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.057
- [sighs] It's like--like I
know what matters

23:45.091 --> 23:46.926
and what doesn't,

23:46.959 --> 23:49.462
and I feel like, I'm done
with this whole situation.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.564
- She's pretending whatever bad
things happen

23:51.598 --> 23:52.865
just didn't happen.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.100
She's creating her own rosy
picture,

23:54.133 --> 23:55.602
right, a clean past.

23:55.635 --> 23:56.869
She's pink clouding.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.170
- So, this is the new me.

23:58.204 --> 24:01.073
This is the new, new Mandy.

24:01.107 --> 24:04.210
I just--I feel great.

24:06.045 --> 24:10.650
So yeah, that's all I wanted
to say.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.686
I'm done now.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.987
- She made a decision.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.990
I got to go talk to her.
- Uh, hey.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.992
- You know, I lost a girl
five years ago.

24:20.026 --> 24:23.796
- I do, I remember.
Let's go.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.998
- Bruce is with Mandy
in her room.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.901
- Good, so we just need
to talk to her.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.503
- You're scaring me,
detectives.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.104
- We just want to make sure
she's safe.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.040
[tense music]

24:34.073 --> 24:36.042
- I'm not going to testify.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.545
This is what's best for me
so don't waste your time.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.547
- Okay, that's not why
we're here, Mandy.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.915
- You took down most of your
pictures of all your friends.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.217
*

24:45.251 --> 24:47.053
- They're not my friends.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.522
- You also took down the
picture of your family.

24:49.556 --> 24:52.525
- I just want to be clear,
clean, a clean slate.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.661
- You don't want to feel
anything.

24:54.694 --> 24:55.995
- Exactly.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.129
It's better this way.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.998
- It's better not to care?

24:59.031 --> 25:00.733
- That's right. I don't care.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.102
I don't care about the Facebook
posts or the texts

25:03.135 --> 25:05.538
or the tweets saying
that I'm liar and a skank.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.607
And I should just curl up
into a ball and die.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.542
I'm done.
- But you made a decision.

25:09.576 --> 25:12.545
You know, it might feel good
to take control.

25:12.579 --> 25:16.048
You know, you can keep a
promise to yourself that...

25:16.082 --> 25:17.650
if it does get too bad,

25:17.684 --> 25:19.185
you could always do
something about it.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.953
- You don't know how I feel.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.555
- I know more than you think.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.691
You know I told you
my name was Amanda, too.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.594
Well, when I was your age
I lived in a tiny town

25:27.627 --> 25:29.829
in Georgia,
and everybody gossiped.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.097
And I did something stupid,

25:31.130 --> 25:32.799
and I got a reputation.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.333
And it's all I thought about,

25:34.366 --> 25:36.669
the names that they were
calling me,

25:36.703 --> 25:38.705
"Easy-ass Amanda"

25:38.738 --> 25:40.740
and worse.

25:40.773 --> 25:44.110
It took a long time...

25:44.143 --> 25:47.847
I realized what other people
said about me...

25:47.880 --> 25:50.249
It didn't define me.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.785
Only I can define me.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.320
[somber music]

25:54.353 --> 25:57.790
And when I was old enough I
went and got this.

25:57.824 --> 26:01.894
*

26:01.928 --> 26:04.263
It's my name, Amanda.

26:04.296 --> 26:07.299
Just to remind myself that
that's who I am,

26:07.333 --> 26:09.969
not any of these other names
that I was branded with.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.939
*

26:12.972 --> 26:15.141
- Why are you telling me this?

26:15.174 --> 26:18.878
Why'd you even come here?

26:18.911 --> 26:23.249
- Because we want you to know
that you're not alone.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.885
Your parents are here.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.887
We are here.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.857
And we're not going
to let you go.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.391
Look.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.962
I know you think that you don't
have a choice, but you do.

26:35.995 --> 26:39.398
And I know that you know
that inside.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.034
Right?

26:42.068 --> 26:43.970
Yeah.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.305
- [crying]

26:46.338 --> 26:49.041
- It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.844
It's okay.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.946
You're okay.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.382
Yeah, it's okay.

27:01.988 --> 27:02.288
.

27:02.321 --> 27:02.989
- "We hate you,
you ugly bitch."

27:04.223 --> 27:05.825
"You wanted it

27:05.858 --> 27:07.193
now you're crying rape,
you piece of trash."

27:07.226 --> 27:08.695
"Liar, liar, ugly little liar."

27:08.728 --> 27:09.862
- Mandy's been sent dozens
of texts,

27:09.896 --> 27:11.430
messages, photos.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.100
She's been bullied non-stop
for the past three days.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.268
She hasn't told her parents.
She hasn't told anyone.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.970
- Do we know who's sending
these?

27:18.004 --> 27:19.839
- Yeah, I mean, it's kids
from the high school,

27:19.872 --> 27:21.373
boys and girls,

27:21.407 --> 27:23.209
and girls are actually
more brutal.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.778
- The school has issued
some suspensions,

27:25.812 --> 27:27.246
but they say
that they can't police

27:27.279 --> 27:29.148
off-campus social media use.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.449
- Yeah, they're teenagers so...

27:30.482 --> 27:31.984
They don't listen
to their parents.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.219
- Yeah, and they're empowered

27:33.252 --> 27:34.787
because they're
behind a screen.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.689
I mean, even Andrew's been
texting her.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.124
- Anything that rises
to the level of harassment?

27:38.157 --> 27:39.291
- Oh. Yes.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.860
"Why are you doing this?"

27:40.893 --> 27:42.294
"Call me back."
"We need to talk."

27:42.328 --> 27:43.863
It's non-stop.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.032
I mean, you ask me,
that's harassment.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.366
- You ask a judge, it's not.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.801
- The level of viciousness

27:48.835 --> 27:51.370
from these other kids,
I mean...

27:51.403 --> 27:54.741
They--they drove her to the
point, you know,

27:54.774 --> 27:57.810
right, she was on the edge
of the cliff.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.345
- And you and Liv pulled
her back.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.880
- Yeah, but--
- The only criminal act

28:00.913 --> 28:02.148
I can charge right now

28:02.181 --> 28:03.850
is violating
the order of protection.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.417
The parents can go
after him, civilly.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.853
- Yeah, and they plan to.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.154
- The strongest message
we can send

28:08.187 --> 28:09.355
is a conviction
on the rape.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.023
How is Mandy's state
of mind now?

28:11.057 --> 28:12.458
Can she testify?

28:15.394 --> 28:18.430
- She's... [sighs]
she's getting counseling,

28:18.464 --> 28:22.969
and her parents
are supportive, but...

28:23.002 --> 28:25.437
It's gonna take time.
- Which we don't have.

28:25.471 --> 28:28.808
- Can you make the case
without her?

28:28.841 --> 28:30.442
- If I have to.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.311
I wouldn't want to.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.346
Keep me posted.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.784
- Teenagers have always
been cruel.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.251
When did they become cowards?

28:39.285 --> 28:41.020
- Since the invention
of the internet.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.055
- What kind of world are our
kids going to grow up--

28:43.089 --> 28:45.291
- Just whatever we think we're
going to have to worry about,

28:45.324 --> 28:46.926
it's not going to be that.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.361
It's going to be something
we never saw coming.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.031
[tense music]

28:52.064 --> 28:53.265
- On that note,

28:53.299 --> 28:55.768
Noah's biological grandmother

28:55.802 --> 28:59.038
showed up at my door last week.
- What?

28:59.071 --> 29:00.907
Who?

29:00.940 --> 29:02.041
Johnny D's mother?

29:02.074 --> 29:03.475
- Ellie Porter's.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.277
- Ellie Porter who has no
living relatives?

29:05.311 --> 29:06.512
Are you sure?

29:06.545 --> 29:08.380
- I didn't take a DNA swab.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.049
- Maybe you should.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.350
- She's also filed a petition

29:11.383 --> 29:15.087
to vacate the adoption.

29:15.121 --> 29:18.257
Trevor says that I have nothing
to worry about but...

29:18.290 --> 29:21.227
- What? I'm sorry, what--

29:21.260 --> 29:22.561
What did she have to say?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.563
- She said she was just
making me aware,

29:24.596 --> 29:27.266
you know, not
in a threatening way.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.534
I didn't let her see Noah.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.937
In fact, I closed the door
on her face.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.839
*

29:32.872 --> 29:36.142
I guess it's just magical
thinking on my part, right?

29:36.175 --> 29:38.144
If I don't do anything
about it,

29:38.177 --> 29:40.079
then it will just go away.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.381
[cell phone buzzing]

29:42.414 --> 29:45.818
*

29:45.852 --> 29:47.954
- We've got a problem
in the squad room.

29:49.388 --> 29:52.391
- Tell them what happened.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.226
- It was after school.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.962
He cornered me
in the locker room.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.130
He said what I was doing
to Andrew...

29:58.164 --> 30:00.432
throwing him under the bus was
messed up, and I should pay.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.567
- So they beat you up.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.269
- He has a scratched cornea,

30:03.302 --> 30:04.370
three fractured bones
in his wrist.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.038
- And who was it?

30:06.072 --> 30:07.606
- I don't know.
- Come on, give us the names.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.141
We'll pick them up.
We'll file charges.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.442
- No.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.879
What they did...

30:12.912 --> 30:14.280
I deserved it.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.115
- Max, listen to me.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.251
Testifying against Andrew is
the right thing to do here.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.020
- No, not that.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.454
I mean, I deserved it...

30:22.488 --> 30:25.091
for what I did to Mandy.
I mean...

30:25.124 --> 30:26.425
this is all my fault.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.160
If I hadn't drawn on her,

30:28.194 --> 30:29.962
taken that stupid picture
and texted it to everybody,

30:29.996 --> 30:31.430
none of this would have
happened.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.565
- It's a little late
for that, Max.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.634
- Yeah.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.636
I know, and...

30:37.669 --> 30:39.571
I know you don't believe
it, but...

30:39.605 --> 30:42.008
I really liked Mandy.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.310
I mean, we all did.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.145
Even Andrew.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.546
Maybe too much.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.315
- You're right,
I don't believe it.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.351
- Well, believe this: my son is
not testifying at trial.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.887
- We had a deal.
- And now we're backing out.

30:54.921 --> 30:57.556
And save your Federal child
pornography threats.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.458
My brother-in-law's a lawyer.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.327
He says you're bluffing.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.295
Max, let's go.

31:03.329 --> 31:06.332
[tense music]

31:06.365 --> 31:08.300
- Now what?

31:08.334 --> 31:11.904
Max is the one who saw Andrew
go into the study.

31:11.938 --> 31:15.041
He saw Andrew on top of Mandy,

31:15.074 --> 31:16.342
heard him bragging.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.644
- So without Max,
I don't have a case.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.446
- Can you compel his testimony?

31:20.479 --> 31:23.182
- Yeah, I could but it usually
backfires.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.484
- Well, if Andrew wasn't open
to a plea before,

31:25.517 --> 31:27.253
he certainly won't be now.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.921
- Yeah, not without some
leverage.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.257
What did Max mean when he said
that Andrew...

31:31.290 --> 31:33.225
liked Mandy too much?

31:33.259 --> 31:34.626
- It's a teenager's
justification

31:34.660 --> 31:36.228
for taking what he wants
without consent.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.696
We've heard that before.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.532
- Yeah, but we haven't
heard it from Andrew.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.634
- Maybe Mandy has.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.570
- I thought you told her not to
communicate with him.

31:44.603 --> 31:49.008
- And since when do
teenagers listen.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.376
- I don't understand.
I thought you said

31:50.409 --> 31:52.044
not to talk to him.
- We did,

31:52.078 --> 31:54.380
but we're hoping that
you did, anyway.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.115
- I tried not to.
- Okay,

31:56.148 --> 31:58.017
and it's fine, we just want to
know what he said.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.186
It could help the case.
- So did he text you back?

32:00.219 --> 32:02.154
- A few times.

32:02.188 --> 32:06.192
*

32:06.225 --> 32:07.726
- Okay.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.096
"I don't understand why
you did this.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.998
I thought you were my friend."
And he texts back,

32:12.031 --> 32:16.135
"Don't you get it? I don't want
to be your friend.

32:16.168 --> 32:20.106
"I'm sorry, but I was sick of
trying to get you to like me.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.274
Now both of our lives are
over."

32:22.308 --> 32:25.077
- Mandy, I wish you had shown
this to us before.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.678
- I didn't want to get
in trouble.

32:26.712 --> 32:30.549
- You're not.
He is. What he texted you...

32:30.582 --> 32:33.252
That's an admission of rape.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.722
*

32:39.992 --> 32:40.292
.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.527
- "I'm sorry, but I was sick of
trying to get you to like me."

32:43.362 --> 32:46.332
- So, Andrew, are
those your words?

32:46.365 --> 32:48.167
- Yes.
- That text

32:48.200 --> 32:49.535
along with a half dozen others

32:49.568 --> 32:51.503
shows remorse and a tacit
admission of guilt.

32:51.537 --> 32:54.340
- I'm sorry, Mr. Barba, I don't
see a smoking gun here.

32:54.373 --> 32:55.707
- No, neither do I.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.309
- Andrew.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.510
We get that...

32:58.544 --> 33:00.279
you wanted her to like you.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.380
We all understand that.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.149
The question is...

33:03.182 --> 33:06.785
did she want to have sex
with you?

33:06.818 --> 33:09.255
- No.

33:09.288 --> 33:12.591
- Okay.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.493
- I liked her.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.563
Not like a friend...

33:17.596 --> 33:20.566
I just wanted her
to like me back...

33:20.599 --> 33:22.568
like that.

33:24.536 --> 33:27.439
Then she wouldn't let me
kiss her.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.808
She made this...

33:29.841 --> 33:33.279
this face...

33:33.312 --> 33:35.647
like I disgusted her.

33:37.749 --> 33:40.552
I love her.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.688
I just wanted her
to love me back.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.057
And now she hates me.
- Oh, Andrew.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.093
*

33:47.126 --> 33:48.594
- [sighs]

33:48.627 --> 33:51.230
Just to be clear, Andrew.

33:51.263 --> 33:54.233
Did Mandy Fowler consent to
have sex with you?

33:54.266 --> 33:55.667
- No.
- He didn't mean it.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.436
He didn't mean to hurt her.
- Mrs. Drake,

33:57.469 --> 33:59.438
I know that this is difficult,

33:59.471 --> 34:01.840
but your son has an opportunity

34:01.873 --> 34:05.043
to take responsibility
for what he did.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.247
- Rape three, 18 months.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.715
- Hold on--
- No, Mr. Guthrie.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.317
I want to hear.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.552
- Four years probation,
and he goes on the registry.

34:13.585 --> 34:17.489
- And he has to allocute.

34:17.523 --> 34:22.194
- You need to confess
in open court to the rape.

34:22.228 --> 34:26.732
Andrew, the entire school
thinks that Mandy is a liar.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.601
So they need to hear the truth

34:29.635 --> 34:32.171
from you.

34:32.204 --> 34:37.809
*

34:37.843 --> 34:42.281
- Mr. Drake, you may begin
when ready.

34:42.314 --> 34:48.387
*

34:48.420 --> 34:50.422
- I am here to confess to
the crime

34:50.456 --> 34:54.626
I committed on October 14th.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.363
I knew Mandy was high,

34:57.396 --> 35:01.233
incapacitated.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.169
I kissed her

35:03.202 --> 35:06.372
which I knew she didn't want/

35:06.405 --> 35:08.774
I had sex with her

35:08.807 --> 35:13.779
which she didn't want
and didn't consent to.

35:13.812 --> 35:19.518
*

35:19.551 --> 35:21.887
I'm sorry...

35:21.920 --> 35:25.624
for making people think
you were a liar.

35:25.657 --> 35:29.161
Everyone should know that you
were telling the truth.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.650
- You're going to be okay,
Mandy.

35:53.752 --> 35:57.189
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:57.223 --> 35:59.825
- What we talked about, you
coming to the school,

35:59.858 --> 36:02.428
you think you could do that?

36:02.461 --> 36:04.863
- Whenever you're ready.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.639
- Mandy just asked me to...

36:13.672 --> 36:15.607
come to her high school,

36:15.641 --> 36:17.376
talk about the issues.
- So she's moving forward,

36:17.409 --> 36:19.311
looking in the future--
- Lieutenant Olivia Benson?

36:19.345 --> 36:20.879
- Yes.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.719
- What is it?

36:27.753 --> 36:32.791
- It's a Notice of Motion from
Sheila Porter's attorney.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.260
[exhales]

36:34.293 --> 36:37.596
She's asking the court
for financial disclosure

36:37.629 --> 36:39.898
and a psychological evaluation.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.704
She's trying to challenge
my fitness as a parent.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.743
*

36:51.777 --> 36:55.881
- I'm a survivor
of sexual assault.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.917
I felt...broken.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.553
I was sad, angry.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.955
But then what came after...

37:03.989 --> 37:05.624
the bullying...

37:05.657 --> 37:07.393
I felt like...

37:07.426 --> 37:10.028
like I was underwater,
drowning.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.265
And I want you to know,

37:13.299 --> 37:14.800
what you do,

37:14.833 --> 37:17.836
what you say to each other,

37:17.869 --> 37:19.271
it hurts.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.540
It has consequences.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.475
- Yeah.

37:23.509 --> 37:26.778
So, first, I'd just like
to commend Mandy

37:26.812 --> 37:30.849
for her incredible bravery.

37:30.882 --> 37:35.854
So, you know, we're not here
to place blame.

37:35.887 --> 37:38.290
We're not here
to point fingers.

37:38.324 --> 37:41.827
We're here to start a
conversation.

37:41.860 --> 37:45.997
I would like to invite
you all to, uh,

37:46.031 --> 37:49.935
participate
in a little exercise.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.871
So if you would all
close your eyes,

37:52.904 --> 37:56.542
and just take a second
to center yourselves.

37:56.575 --> 38:00.312
[indistinct whispering]

38:00.346 --> 38:03.582
- Come on, if I can do it,
then...

38:08.820 --> 38:13.892
- Great. So while keeping
your eyes closed...

38:13.925 --> 38:16.862
I'm gonna ask you to stand up

38:16.895 --> 38:22.067
if you've ever been hurt
by bullying.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.507
[somber music]

38:28.540 --> 38:30.842
*

38:30.876 --> 38:33.111
Keeping your eyes closed,

38:33.144 --> 38:37.583
stand up if you've ever been
the victim of hazing.

38:37.616 --> 38:41.052
*

38:41.086 --> 38:44.022
If you've ever been hurt
by gossip.

38:47.926 --> 38:53.064
Stand up if you've ever been a
victim of a sexual assault.

38:56.768 --> 39:03.975
*

39:09.481 --> 39:14.420
Stand up if you've ever been
a victim of violence,

39:19.190 --> 39:21.092
[exhales]

39:21.126 --> 39:23.962
Okay, I'd like to ask you
to open your eyes.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.367
Take a look around.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.741
I think, if you look
around the room,

39:35.774 --> 39:37.976
we can all agree that...

39:38.009 --> 39:40.812
That we're all
in this together.

39:40.846 --> 39:44.650
You have the power
to change this

39:44.683 --> 39:46.418
by being more accepting,

39:46.452 --> 39:50.155
more compassionate.

39:50.188 --> 39:52.691
You're not alone.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.465
- Mandy.

39:59.498 --> 40:02.901
What happened to you, the same
thing happened to me.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.104
I was wasted at a party.

40:06.137 --> 40:10.676
[voice breaks] Two older guys
took me into a room.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.679
I didn't tell anyone.

40:13.712 --> 40:16.882
I was afraid...that...

40:16.915 --> 40:19.818
what everyone would think,

40:19.851 --> 40:22.153
that I'd be blamed.

40:22.187 --> 40:26.091
- I'm so sorry, thank you
for sharing that.

40:26.124 --> 40:29.961
Would anybody else like
to share? Add anything?

40:31.697 --> 40:33.098
Yes?

40:33.131 --> 40:37.202
- You're worried everyone's
going to think...

40:37.235 --> 40:38.904
You wanted it.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.641
That it was your fault.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.976
'Cause you were drunk.

40:45.010 --> 40:48.847
- I don't want to be
called a liar.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.850
It's like...

40:51.883 --> 40:54.019
You're so ashamed.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.922
- Guys get bullied too.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.257
It's embarrassing to admit.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.926
It really sucks.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.862
But we're expected to just
ignore it.

41:03.895 --> 41:06.031
But it still hurts.

41:09.100 --> 41:13.739
- I thought that saying mean
stuff was just...

41:13.772 --> 41:15.874
joking around,

41:15.907 --> 41:17.676
being a guy,

41:17.709 --> 41:21.179
what you had to do to be cool.

41:21.212 --> 41:23.248
But...

41:23.281 --> 41:25.617
I was wrong.

41:25.651 --> 41:28.654
*

41:28.687 --> 41:31.089
- I didn't stand up for you.

41:31.122 --> 41:34.560
I didn't think I was
strong enough.

41:34.593 --> 41:37.162
I don't know if we could ever
be friends again,

41:37.195 --> 41:40.632
but I just want you to know

41:40.666 --> 41:42.801
I'm sorry.

41:42.834 --> 41:50.041
*

42:01.052 --> 42:03.922
- [breathes deeply]

42:11.663 --> 42:14.265
[dramatic music]

42:14.299 --> 42:21.539

42:41.727 --> 42:44.930
