'The boy never knew his parents,

00:37.440 --> 00:41.640
but was lucky enough
to be raised by his grandparents.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.320

(WIND WHISTLES)

01:02.720 --> 01:06.200
Legend said if ever
the lighthouse light went out,

01:06.240 --> 01:10.800
the Huntsman would enter the river
looking for Spirit Deer

01:10.840 --> 01:14.320
adorned with magical antlers.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.760
Their antlers made the water flow

01:17.800 --> 01:20.120
and let life grow.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.680
And if the Huntsman
took the magical antlers,

01:24.720 --> 01:27.240
the rivers would dry up...

01:28.320 --> 01:32.440
