00:01.835 --> 00:03.903
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.936 --> 00:05.506
Get away from me.

00:05.538 --> 00:07.174
Okay, Jonathan, you want
to point that somewhere else?

00:07.208 --> 00:09.210
You all think I'm an idiot.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.977
A short idiot.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.545
Faith switched.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.682
She had some device.
 She switched our bodies.

00:15.715 --> 00:18.318
Hi, baby. You miss me?

00:18.352 --> 00:20.088
I did, actually.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.089
I love you.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.762
You slept with her.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.232
I was created to kill,

00:32.265 --> 00:34.868
to extinguish life
wherever I find it.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.104
Tell us what to do.

00:39.406 --> 00:40.707
(growling)

00:47.814 --> 00:49.517
Xander, Anya.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.551
Buffy, another one.

00:56.289 --> 00:57.091
WILLOW:
Buffy!

01:01.829 --> 01:03.131
Where's the other one?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.632
Scampered like
a big bumpy bunny.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.334
In there.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.438
(snarling, sucking)

01:22.150 --> 01:24.218
I don't care
if it is an orgy of death,

01:24.251 --> 01:26.085
there's still such
a thing as a napkin.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.222
A nest. No biggie.
I bet I could do it.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.257
I mean, I know
I could take at least two.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.058
Yes. And then we
could run for help

01:32.091 --> 01:34.427
while the other three suck your
heart out through your neck.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.963
(sighs) You're right.
It's too many for just us.

01:36.996 --> 01:38.531
You know who we need.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.105
Uh, hi.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.710
We have a problem.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.048
Sounds like you
could use my help.

01:57.617 --> 02:01.120
(wolf howling)

02:01.155 --> 02:03.224
*

02:51.504 --> 02:53.507
(grunting)

02:59.045 --> 03:00.747
The quick draw is
about more than speed.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.683
It's also about pointing
the stake the right way.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.019
And there can be
splinter issues.

03:06.052 --> 03:08.355
It is a true test of dexterity.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.157
Can you open this?

03:10.189 --> 03:13.126
No. I tear it
and it gets all slushy.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.563
Thanks for doing this, Jonathan.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.997
I wouldn't ask, but...

03:18.031 --> 03:19.400
Hey, don't worry about it.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.835
Nest full of vampires,
you come get me.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.170
Okay. Box full of puppies,

03:24.204 --> 03:25.605
that's more of a judgment call.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.707
Hit me.

03:28.641 --> 03:30.277
You got me.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.280
It was very punchy.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.546
Watch out for southpaws, Buff.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.048
Don't let 'em surprise you.

03:35.081 --> 03:38.018
I can't find a reference
to any, uh, rituals.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.020
Seems more like a...

03:40.052 --> 03:41.288
family meal, if you will.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.590
And they say
no one eats

03:42.622 --> 03:44.091
without the TV on anymore.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.959
(short chuckle)
Thanks, Rupert.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.860
Well, it's good to know
we're not walking into

03:47.895 --> 03:49.729
the unholy feast
of something or other.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.365
WILLOW: Oh, Jonathan, I'm in.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.768
Schematics
for the crypt.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.271
Part of the original plan
for the cemetery.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.307
Sometimes there's a...

03:59.340 --> 04:01.741
Oh, no back way in.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.477
Just the one entrance.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.044
Well, maybe we can
make it work for us.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.813
We could stake out the entrance.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.149
You know, uh, maybe use
a decoy, lure 'em out?

04:09.181 --> 04:10.617
Or I bet...

04:10.651 --> 04:12.586
(typing)

04:12.620 --> 04:14.153
There. I can get in that way.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.223
WILLOW: Oh, of course.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.091
Why didn't I think of that?

04:18.125 --> 04:19.259
I'm sure you would have.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.161
Oh.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.262
I think we have a plan.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.300
Buffy... you go in first.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.834
Let 'em get a look at a slayer.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.569
Xander...

04:29.603 --> 04:31.137
The Nimzowitsch defense.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.805
Let's see
if I remember.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.345
Mm-hmm. Mate in four.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.846
You almost got me
that time, Rupert.

04:39.879 --> 04:43.250
Xander, Willow, and Anya,
you back up Buffy.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.418
I'll be the surprise guest.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.120
Everyone,
let's show these fiends

04:48.154 --> 04:50.358
that they came
to the wrong town.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.860
(door opens)

04:57.965 --> 05:00.334
*

05:00.367 --> 05:02.201
(growling)

05:07.507 --> 05:08.742
WILLOW:
Buffy, he's getting away!

05:19.252 --> 05:21.689
I should have gotten that one.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.122
You got two of them.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.992
And that second one
was ready for you.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.726
You should feel pretty good.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.062
But I let one get by me.
Hey, don't worry.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.564
You know it only matters
that you do your best.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.403
But that's just it--

05:35.435 --> 05:37.170
I don't think
it was my best.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.338
PAPARAZZO:
Hey Jonathan. Over here.
Quick photo, please.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.375
Another one?
One more? Couple more?

05:41.408 --> 05:44.043
Right here.
JONATHAN: Okay guys, that's
enough. Thanks for coming by.

05:44.076 --> 05:45.812
Well, I think
we did great.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.048
We knocked 'em dead,
which they already were.

05:49.081 --> 05:50.483
We knocked 'em deader.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.851
Well, they weren't
very well organized.

05:51.884 --> 05:53.754
If they had all
rushed at Buffy,

05:53.786 --> 05:56.088
they could have
killed her right away.
BUFFY: Thanks, Anya.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.691
That won't keep me
awake all night.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.226
Vampires only form nests
to make hunting easier.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.228
They're not big
on the cooperation.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.596
They mostly like to hang out

06:03.630 --> 06:06.199
all creepy and alone
in the shadows.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.401
Don't you agree, Spike?

06:13.072 --> 06:15.408
Well, well.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.976
The man himself.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.449
What are you doing here?

06:21.481 --> 06:23.850
I live here.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.718
I wasn't exactly pining
for a noisy visit

06:25.752 --> 06:29.088
from Wonder Jonathan
and his fluffy battle kittens.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.091
Yeah? You think that one up

06:31.124 --> 06:33.225
with all the time you spend
not being able to bite people?

06:33.259 --> 06:35.528
Careful. He's still
pretty dangerous.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.896
Yeah, back off, Betty.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.098
It's Buffy.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.769
You big, bleached...

06:41.802 --> 06:43.136
stupid guy.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.605
Spike...

06:45.639 --> 06:48.475
you're the worst type of scum.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.612
The second you're back
to your old tricks, well...

06:51.644 --> 06:54.548
let's just say before you even
sniff out your first victim,

06:54.581 --> 06:56.550
you'll be pretty
indistinguishable from--

06:56.584 --> 06:58.586
oh, what should we say--

06:58.619 --> 07:00.454
instant soup mix.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.992
Next thing I know,

07:06.026 --> 07:08.461
this crazed vamp
is, like, running right at me.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.430
And I know that
if it gets past me,

07:10.463 --> 07:14.000
there's no telling
who's in danger next.

07:14.033 --> 07:15.168
Come on.
You have fun.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.504
Admit it.
Living the Scooby life.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.106
I was going for a
kind of stoic bravery.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.843
But, yeah. And
it was exciting

07:22.875 --> 07:25.846
with the ceiling coming
in and everything.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.415
Oh, that's a cute one.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.684
A-And Buffy-- sh-she was okay?

07:30.718 --> 07:33.286
Oh, she was great.
Twang. Poof.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.156
That was the sound.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.324
Uh, crossbow vampire dusting.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.026
I mean, she was
a little cranky

07:40.060 --> 07:41.829
that she missed that one vamp.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.930
Well, I-I kind of meant
personally.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.533
That-that whole thing
with Faith,

07:45.566 --> 07:46.766
that pretty much
freaked me out,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.002
and I was just
sensing it from a distance.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.504
Oh, well, yeah.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.872
I know she's not over the whole

07:51.904 --> 07:53.340
Riley sleeping
with Faith thing.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.108
Oh, you know what I mean.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.511
Faith's insides
in Buffy's outsides,

07:57.545 --> 07:59.211
when her insides were out.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.949
I hope they'll
be okay.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.185
I'm sure
it'll blow over.

08:05.218 --> 08:08.055
They're probably all
with the smoochies right now.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.559
You must be
feeling better.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.560
Yeah. Yeah.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.163
You know,
a lot stronger.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.898
I mean,
no Jonathan, but...

08:17.930 --> 08:19.231
I'm doing okay.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.533
Are you?

08:20.567 --> 08:22.870
I mean, you're not...

08:22.903 --> 08:25.906
What?

08:25.939 --> 08:29.042
Eating the Initiative's
Technicolor food of strongness?

08:29.076 --> 08:31.511
No, uh-uh.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.647
They, uh, they swear
they stopped treating the food,

08:33.681 --> 08:35.048
but I'm not taking the chance.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.683
You know, I, uh,
I don't know if that means

08:37.717 --> 08:41.187
I'll get weaker or dumber or...

08:41.221 --> 08:42.489
or smarter.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.924
They're not big
with the disclosure, huh?

08:44.957 --> 08:47.027
They still haven't released
a full profile on Adam.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.495
And we're having zero luck
tracking him.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.863
I just...

08:51.431 --> 08:53.332
If they just put
a little trust in me,

08:53.365 --> 08:55.001
I know I could
get the job done.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.270
I've felt that way
my entire life.

09:12.284 --> 09:16.456
(sighs)

09:16.489 --> 09:19.058
You'd think I could do that.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.293
I guess it takes
different muscles

09:20.326 --> 09:21.928
than demon beheading.

09:21.961 --> 09:23.596
You just need a few pointers.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.703
Now, if slaying
was a competitive sport,

09:30.738 --> 09:32.438
then I'd have a chance.

09:32.471 --> 09:33.373
You know, we could have

09:33.405 --> 09:35.142
figure staking

09:35.174 --> 09:36.876
and speed staking. I...

09:36.909 --> 09:38.311
(grunts)
Oh...

09:38.345 --> 09:40.212
Sorry, I...

09:40.246 --> 09:42.115
This just isn't my game.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.582
I got to...

09:45.985 --> 09:47.988
(door closes)

09:50.256 --> 09:51.725
It's all Faith's fault.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.726
She's like poison.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.029
No, worse. She's like acid
that eats through everything.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.634
Maybe she's a bomb.

10:00.668 --> 10:03.836
The point is everything was
going along great with Riley,

10:03.870 --> 10:07.807
and then she comes along
and messes everything up.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.576
Buffy, you know what I think?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.413
I don't think this is about you
being angry with Faith.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.414
I think you're angry with Riley.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.485
WOMAN:
Hi. Could you please...
Riley?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.754
Sure. I mean,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.823
you have this amazing
connection with him.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.326
Thank you.
And then at
the one moment

10:26.359 --> 10:29.261
when it matters the most,
he looks into your eyes

10:29.296 --> 10:30.998
and he doesn't even
see that it's not

10:31.030 --> 10:32.399
you looking back at him.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.105
Uh, there's no way
he could know.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.709
I mean, you don't just
look at someone and say,

10:41.741 --> 10:43.610
"Hey, that's not your body.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.511
Get out of that body
with your hands up."

10:45.544 --> 10:46.947
I know you
know that.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.381
But you have to believe it.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.317
Buffy, if there's any
part of you that's blaming Riley

10:51.350 --> 10:54.486
for what happened, it seems
like there's a part of you

10:54.520 --> 10:55.755
that needs to forgive him.

10:57.356 --> 10:58.859
WOMAN:
You're Jonathan Levinson.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.360
Oh, my God.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.995
Oh, my God!
My name is Karen

11:03.029 --> 11:05.197
and I think you're...
you're wonderful.

11:05.231 --> 11:06.499
Oh, my God!

11:06.533 --> 11:08.368
Hi, Karen. Thank you.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.470
Oh, is that my book?
Well, I could...

11:10.503 --> 11:11.839
Yeah, please. I-I didn't
want to bother you.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.874
It's Karen with a K. (giggles)

11:20.913 --> 11:23.682
Thank you... so much.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.052
Thanks!

11:25.085 --> 11:26.653
Sure.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.721
So what do you think, Buffy?

11:28.755 --> 11:30.724
I mean, if I'm wrong, smack me.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.491
Karen with a K
will lend you a book,

11:32.524 --> 11:34.394
and it's pretty heavy.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.667
Maybe I have
been blaming him.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.769
But how do I get past it?

11:42.802 --> 11:44.504
I mean, what if it's too late?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.173
What if after all this,
he doesn't want me anymore?

11:47.206 --> 11:48.674
He does.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.409
It's not gonna be easy, Buffy,

11:50.442 --> 11:52.544
but you guys are
very special together.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.547
That's worth
a little hard work.

11:57.250 --> 12:02.288
But, I'm not even sure if I know
how to talk to him anymore.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.591
How do I make it okay again?

12:04.624 --> 12:06.125
If you really want it,

12:06.158 --> 12:08.928
you can make anything happen.

12:08.961 --> 12:11.097
For those of you
who don't already know,

12:11.130 --> 12:14.734
my name is
Colonel George Haviland.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.370
I'm commanding officer here
until such time

12:17.403 --> 12:19.706
as the facility review
is completed.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.109
This review does not mean

12:22.142 --> 12:25.477
our primary mission
is changed in any way.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.580
Recovery of the hostile
known as Adam

12:27.614 --> 12:30.750
is our first
and most important job.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.821
To this end,
I've asked

12:33.854 --> 12:36.123
our tactical
consultant here

12:36.155 --> 12:39.091
to address us today.
Mr. Levinson.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.431
Thank you, Colonel.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.366
It's about time
we brought out the big guns.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.139
Men, before
we can locate Adam,

12:53.173 --> 12:54.908
we need to understand
him better,

12:54.942 --> 12:56.308
and there's something
that's bothered me

12:56.342 --> 12:58.577
almost from the start.

12:58.610 --> 13:01.014
He doesn't eat.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.315
We've known him to kill,

13:02.349 --> 13:05.152
but never to eat the kill.

13:05.184 --> 13:06.485
So I pulled
some of Professor Walsh's

13:06.519 --> 13:08.254
original design schematics,

13:08.288 --> 13:10.289
and I found something.

13:10.322 --> 13:14.193
His power source
is not biological at all.

13:14.226 --> 13:17.129
It's here.
The design attempts to hide it,

13:17.163 --> 13:19.631
but I believe that
there's a small reservoir

13:19.666 --> 13:22.134
of uranium 235.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.537
Sir, how long will it last?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.605
Essentially forever.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.875
It also means that cutting off
his head is useless.

13:30.509 --> 13:31.811
Killing Adam

13:31.845 --> 13:34.681
means annihilating him
completely.

13:34.713 --> 13:37.049
But first we have to find him.

13:37.084 --> 13:40.953
KAREN:
Where are you Jonathan?

13:40.988 --> 13:43.090
Are you, like, never home?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.568
(grunting)

14:06.613 --> 14:08.380
I feel terrible.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.250
She's ready to forget it.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.318
You better be ready, too.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.187
I don't know, Jonathan. I mean,

14:15.221 --> 14:18.258
I don't know if she'll
really ever forget it.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.326
Every time I try
to touch her...

14:20.360 --> 14:22.162
She's scared.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.429
Scared of me?

14:23.462 --> 14:24.998
Scared of what
you're thinking about.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.765
What do you mean?

14:26.798 --> 14:30.437
She knows that Faith is...
experienced.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.038
(gun cocks)

14:32.072 --> 14:33.240
What are you saying?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.174
Experienced?

14:35.207 --> 14:37.210
Oh, God.
Does she think that...

14:37.244 --> 14:38.912
what, that I'd be comparing?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.783
She knows she's the one I...
I care about.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.451
Have you let her know that?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.886
I think I... Haven't I?

14:47.921 --> 14:50.889
She has to know.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.259
People can't always see
what's right in front of them.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.596
*

15:00.067 --> 15:02.769
* I love the big witch doctor

15:02.802 --> 15:04.903
* who stirred the brew for me

15:04.937 --> 15:06.873
* I took sips
from your sweet lips *

15:06.905 --> 15:09.942
* and now I can't get free

15:09.976 --> 15:11.979
* Trapped in the web of love

15:12.011 --> 15:14.047
* Trapped in the web
of love *

15:14.081 --> 15:15.481
I did not.

15:15.514 --> 15:19.451
Last night. With me.
You said "Jonathan."

15:19.485 --> 15:21.254
It was a moan.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.490
Fine, you moaned
"Jonathan."

15:23.523 --> 15:24.890
Uh-uh.

15:24.923 --> 15:27.059
It was like, "Ah..."

15:27.094 --> 15:29.761
Maybe it was "Aah-nathan."

15:29.796 --> 15:31.965
Still not fluffing up
the old ego.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.767
Quite the couple, aren't they?

15:34.801 --> 15:37.636
They get into a fistfight,
I've got a 50 on Anya.

15:37.669 --> 15:39.838
Wonder if they'll make it.

15:48.215 --> 15:52.451
(crowd cheering)

15:52.485 --> 15:54.787
JONATHAN:
Okay, okay.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.623
Good evening, everyone.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.825
I'd like to dedicate this song
to some friends of mine,

15:58.857 --> 16:02.328
a very special couple who've
been going through a tough time.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.299
* When I hear that serenade

16:07.333 --> 16:10.537
* In blue

16:10.570 --> 16:14.307
* I'm somewhere
in another world *

16:14.341 --> 16:17.876
* Alone with you

16:17.909 --> 16:19.812
* Sharing all the joys

16:19.846 --> 16:23.450
* We used to know

16:23.482 --> 16:26.318
* Many moons

16:26.352 --> 16:29.522
* Ago

16:29.556 --> 16:31.791
* Once again

16:31.823 --> 16:35.727
* Your face
comes back to me *

16:35.761 --> 16:38.030
* Just like the theme

16:38.065 --> 16:41.000
* Of some forgotten

16:41.033 --> 16:43.570
* Melody

16:43.602 --> 16:44.903
* In the album

16:44.937 --> 16:48.875
* Of my memory

16:48.908 --> 16:52.044
* Serenade

16:52.078 --> 16:55.981
* In blue

16:56.014 --> 16:58.485
* Seems like only yesterday

16:58.518 --> 17:01.921
* A small cafe,
a crowded floor *

17:01.953 --> 17:05.424
* And as we danced
the night away *

17:05.458 --> 17:08.260
* I hear you say forever more

17:08.295 --> 17:11.998
* And then the song
became a sign *

17:12.030 --> 17:15.201
* Forever more became good-bye

17:15.233 --> 17:17.269
* 'Cause you remained

17:17.304 --> 17:20.373
* In my heart

17:20.406 --> 17:22.709
* Tell me, darling

17:22.741 --> 17:25.743
* Is there still a spark?

17:25.778 --> 17:27.346
Buffy, I want you to know...

17:27.380 --> 17:29.582
Do we have
to have the talk?

17:29.615 --> 17:33.353
No talk. More dance.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.355
I just want to say
I'm sorry...

17:35.387 --> 17:37.089
It's only you that I want.

17:37.124 --> 17:40.058
I know.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.095
I know all of that.

17:42.128 --> 17:43.829
You do?

17:44.830 --> 17:46.199
Since when?

17:46.232 --> 17:49.201
* Serenade...

17:49.236 --> 17:51.403
Since you put your arms
around me.

17:51.438 --> 17:55.074
* In blue.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.346
(applause)

18:04.083 --> 18:07.686
Oh, my God. He's gonna do
something off the new album.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.298
Xander?

18:18.330 --> 18:19.432
Yeah?

18:19.465 --> 18:21.134
Let's go have sex now.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.135
Yeah.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.537
Okay.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.858
Oh. What is it?
Are you okay?

18:48.694 --> 18:50.128
(band stops playing)

18:50.163 --> 18:53.200
Karen.
That's your name isn't it?

18:53.232 --> 18:55.701
I-I signed my book for you.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.770
Tell me what hurt you, Karen.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.207
I can help.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.309
Let's get you warmed up.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.613
What's going on?
Why are you here?

19:06.645 --> 19:09.316
Mr. Levinson,
someone on your staff

19:09.348 --> 19:11.183
reported a disturbance.
When I realized

19:11.218 --> 19:12.719
it was on your property,

19:12.751 --> 19:14.554
I thought I'd better
come down in person.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.623
That's all right, Sergeant.
I have it under control.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.391
Of course, sir. Glad to see
you're all right.

19:20.759 --> 19:23.996
Karen, I know you're scared,

19:24.029 --> 19:26.065
but I need to hear
your description again.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.568
I-It was ugly.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.637
Big ugly.
All bent over, sort of,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.205
with these huge arms,

19:33.240 --> 19:36.476
and, like, scabs and stuff.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.211
That must have been very
frightening. I'm so sorry...

19:39.246 --> 19:42.214
Oh. Oh, I forgot.
It had a mark.
A mark?

19:42.249 --> 19:44.517
On its forehead, like a symbol.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.962
Well...

19:58.265 --> 19:59.231
this is a clue.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.532
Jonathan?

20:00.567 --> 20:01.768
I've heard of this.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.569
It's not a demon,
just a monster.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.238
Not much more
than an animal.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.838
It sticks to the woods,

20:06.873 --> 20:09.008
doesn't come near
populated areas.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.042
But it did this time.
It might again.

20:11.076 --> 20:12.412
Maybe we should patrol.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.012
If you want me
to mobilize a squad...

20:14.046 --> 20:16.348
Actually, I think
Karen simply startled it.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.750
Probably more afraid of you
than you were of it.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.386
I'll patrol, but you don't
need to worry about it.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.188
I can handle it on my own.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.457
Now, let's see about
getting Karen a ride home.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.472
I wish you'd
get rid of that body.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.741
The smell's
making me hungry.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.742
You wouldn't want it.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.711
It had a blood disease.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.212
He didn't know it,
but it would've been dead

20:47.246 --> 20:49.115
within the year.

20:49.147 --> 20:52.484
Humans sense so little
of what they carry inside.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.554
Huh. All right.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.624
Well, you're the evil
messiah guy, so...

20:57.656 --> 20:59.558
Oh, hey, there's
something new in town.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.894
Yeah, attacked a girl,
caused a little fuss.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.497
Oh, he was there.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.403
Jonathan.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.271
Jonathan.
Tell me, who is he?

21:13.306 --> 21:14.874
(chuckles)
You're joking, right?

21:16.142 --> 21:18.009
Jonathan is Jonathan.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.311
Look.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.515
These are lies.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.351
None of this is real.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.319
The world has been changed.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.356
It's intriguing, but it's wrong.

21:32.491 --> 21:33.925
Feels okay to me.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.261
You're under his spell,
just like the others.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.297
I seem to be the only one
who's not.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.967
Really? Well, what
makes you so special?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.669
I'm aware.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.871
I know every molecule of myself

21:44.903 --> 21:47.374
and everything around me.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.675
No one-- no human, no demon--

21:49.709 --> 21:53.613
has ever been as awake
and alive as I am.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.648
You are all just shadows.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.084
Oh.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.887
So...

22:01.921 --> 22:03.556
What do-what do you do now?

22:05.257 --> 22:06.893
Hey, you could kill Jonathan.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.229
Well, or, you could try.

22:10.261 --> 22:12.230
The guy's, like,
a dynamo of action.

22:12.263 --> 22:14.333
I don't need to do anything.

22:14.366 --> 22:17.236
These magics
are unstable, corrosive.

22:17.269 --> 22:20.071
They will inevitably
lead to chaos.

22:21.272 --> 22:23.509
And I am interested in chaos.

22:44.262 --> 22:47.098
Jonathan, aren't you
coming to bed?

22:48.768 --> 22:50.102
Yeah, it's getting late.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.704
Be right there.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.851
WILLOW:
 I'm glad you're okay.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.685
Everyone in the Bronze
was pretty freaked out

23:06.719 --> 23:08.520
after you left.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.523
So, I guess you have to
go fight this thing, huh?

23:11.557 --> 23:13.224
All the weapons are at Giles'.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.227
It shouldn't take too long.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.796
No go.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.263
Did you just go, "no go?"

23:18.297 --> 23:19.766
Jonathan did.

23:19.798 --> 23:21.433
He said it was
some brainless beastie

23:21.468 --> 23:23.301
and that he would
take care of it himself.

23:23.335 --> 23:25.771
Oh, cool.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.440
I guess.

23:27.473 --> 23:31.242
I don't know, it just...
he seemed a little...

23:31.277 --> 23:32.545
scared.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.413
Uh, Buffy,
this is Jonathan.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.115
You know he doesn't get scared.

23:37.148 --> 23:38.550
You talked about it
when you gave him

23:38.585 --> 23:40.487
the class protector award
at the prom.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.922
You're right.

23:42.954 --> 23:45.156
Um...

23:45.191 --> 23:47.093
my exit.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.361
Willow, I'll see you tomorrow?

23:51.463 --> 23:52.330
Okay.

23:55.701 --> 23:59.471
So, I saw you and Riley,
with the dancing.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.909
It was a great dance.

24:02.942 --> 24:07.846
Yeah, for the first time
I felt like Faith wasn't there.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.650
Like no one was there but us.

24:16.387 --> 24:17.624
(growl)

24:17.656 --> 24:18.457
(door closes)

24:27.634 --> 24:29.035
(roars)

24:29.067 --> 24:31.002
(screams)

24:39.546 --> 24:40.712
(growling)

24:43.650 --> 24:46.051
Sensus confundantur

24:46.085 --> 24:49.121
et aer oppleatur.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.490
Obscuratam.

25:00.599 --> 25:01.901
(lock clicks)

25:04.502 --> 25:06.806
(knocking)

25:06.838 --> 25:08.974
What's going on?

25:09.008 --> 25:10.609
Oh, my God.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.380
She's gonna be okay.

25:14.413 --> 25:17.516
But she's terrified.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.384
What happened?
What did this?

25:19.417 --> 25:21.921
Someone found her
in the janitor's closet

25:21.953 --> 25:23.355
about an hour ago.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.923
I-I think she was there

25:24.957 --> 25:27.259
all night.
She-she was all alone.

25:27.292 --> 25:28.894
Tara.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.397
What did this?

25:32.431 --> 25:35.534
Big.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.103
Lumpy.

25:37.135 --> 25:39.337
And it had something on its...

25:39.371 --> 25:40.906
on its head...

25:40.940 --> 25:44.611
like... like
a Greek letter, only not.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.190
This?

25:58.223 --> 25:59.726
Was it this?

26:01.760 --> 26:04.696
Buffy, Jonathan said
we were all safe.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.799
Jonathan said it.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.383
Xander's not here.

26:24.415 --> 26:27.886
Oh.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.321
You're not going away.

26:30.355 --> 26:31.824
Why aren't you going away?

26:31.857 --> 26:33.759
Well, I was kind of hoping

26:33.792 --> 26:36.996
to look at
some of Xander's stuff.

26:37.028 --> 26:40.398
Oh.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.969
Sure. Come on in.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.636
Make yourself at home...

26:44.671 --> 26:47.006
and so on.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.130
Oh, you're still here?

27:11.163 --> 27:13.700
That's nice.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.635
May I ask you something?

27:19.371 --> 27:22.008
Does it ever seem
just a little strange

27:22.040 --> 27:25.211
that Jonathan
is so good at everything?

27:26.644 --> 27:28.881
He's Jonathan.

27:28.914 --> 27:30.548
Hey.

27:30.582 --> 27:33.019
I was just at the part
where he invents the Internet.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.554
Anya, he fights
better than I do,

27:35.586 --> 27:37.355
and I'm the slayer.

27:37.388 --> 27:39.325
The slayer.

27:39.357 --> 27:42.560
I mean, that's supposed
to mean something, right?

27:42.594 --> 27:46.298
Oh.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.233
Buck up, you.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.536
You kill the best.
Go you.

27:50.568 --> 27:52.137
Kill, kill.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.404
Actually not needing
validation right now,

27:53.439 --> 27:54.707
but thank you.

27:58.778 --> 28:02.347
He just seems too perfect.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.582
I don't know.

28:03.615 --> 28:05.651
So, I can have my book back?

28:05.683 --> 28:08.220
Anya, when you were a demon,

28:08.253 --> 28:09.922
you granted wishes, right?

28:09.955 --> 28:12.423
Vengeance wishes
on ex-boyfriends.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.260
I'd wish he was a dog or ugly

28:15.294 --> 28:18.998
or in love with
President McKinley or something.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.567
But someone could wish the whole
world to be different, right?

28:21.599 --> 28:23.602
That's possible?

28:23.634 --> 28:25.938
Sure. Alternate realities.

28:25.971 --> 28:28.440
You could, uh... you could have,
like, a world without shrimp.

28:28.473 --> 28:31.076
Or with, you know...

28:31.109 --> 28:32.878
nothing but shrimp.
You could even make, like,

28:32.912 --> 28:34.546
a freaky world
where Jonathan's, like,

28:34.579 --> 28:36.448
some kind of not-perfect
mouth-breather,

28:36.481 --> 28:38.683
if that's what's blowing up
your skirt these days.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.787
Just don't ask me to live there.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.020
Oh.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.355
Now, if, uh...

28:43.388 --> 28:45.691
I can just have my book back,

28:45.723 --> 28:47.625
you'll be on your way
someplace else.

28:47.659 --> 28:50.096
Here.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.767
I'm just saying it
doesn't make any sense.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.568
He starred in The Matrix,
but he never left town.

28:57.603 --> 28:59.438
And how'd he graduate
from med school?

28:59.471 --> 29:01.073
He's only 18 years old.

29:01.106 --> 29:02.875
Effective time management?

29:02.909 --> 29:05.711
I-I'm sorry, Buffy, but I...

29:05.743 --> 29:07.645
I just don't understand
what you're trying to say.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.915
Yeah, and when is
Jonathan gonna get here

29:09.949 --> 29:11.317
and start the meeting?

29:11.349 --> 29:13.318
This is the meeting.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.153
This is the meeting?

29:15.186 --> 29:18.089
Well, I was just kind of...

29:18.124 --> 29:22.060
wondering if maybe
anyone else thought that...

29:22.094 --> 29:25.497
Jonathan was
kind of too perfect?

29:26.865 --> 29:28.433
No, he's not.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.902
He's just perfect enough.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.502
He crushed the bones
of the Master,

29:31.537 --> 29:33.605
he blew up a big snake
made out of mayor,

29:33.638 --> 29:35.574
and he coached
the U.S. women's soccer team

29:35.606 --> 29:37.409
to a stunning
World Cup victory.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.177
We saw him doing those things.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.480
But that's just it.

29:41.512 --> 29:44.817
I'm not entirely sure
that we can trust our memories.

29:44.851 --> 29:47.153
Anya, tell them about
the alternate universes.

29:47.185 --> 29:49.454
Oh, okay, um...

29:49.488 --> 29:51.589
say you really
like shrimp a lot,

29:51.623 --> 29:53.491
or we could say
you don't like shrimp at all.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.961
"Blah, I wish there
weren't any shrimp",

29:54.993 --> 29:56.127
you'd say to yourself.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.563
Stop. You're saying it wrong.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.768
I think that Jonathan
may be doing something

30:02.800 --> 30:04.635
so that he's manipulating
the world

30:04.670 --> 30:08.007
and we're all, like, his pawns.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.942
Or prawns.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.477
Stop with the shrimp.

30:11.509 --> 30:13.244
I am trying to do
something here.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.882
Of course. But, um,

30:15.914 --> 30:18.384
I think you may be
a little out of your depth.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.451
I'm not.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.720
It sounds like nonsense.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.025
But...

30:26.057 --> 30:28.794
I'm starting to know
this girl pretty well,

30:28.826 --> 30:30.496
and I think she sees things

30:30.528 --> 30:32.198
that the rest of us don't.

30:32.230 --> 30:35.666
I think, for once,
we should follow her lead.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.909
Okay.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.881
I think Jonathan
might be ignoring evidence.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.416
I think he might have
let Tara get hurt.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.919
On purpose?

30:52.951 --> 30:56.587
No. No.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.424
H-How did he ignore evidence?

30:59.458 --> 31:01.928
The monster
had a mark on it.

31:01.961 --> 31:05.263
Jonathan saw it
and he kind of...

31:05.297 --> 31:07.199
blinked.

31:07.232 --> 31:09.835
He blinked.
The man moistens his eyeballs,

31:09.867 --> 31:11.436
and we're having
a meeting about it.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.373
He knows something
about the monster.

31:14.405 --> 31:16.208
He was reacting to the mark.

31:16.241 --> 31:18.777
Oh! Wait.
I remember something.

31:18.809 --> 31:20.946
Giles, do you have
a Jonathan swimsuit calendar?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.780
No.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.517
Yes.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.920
I-It was a gift.

31:33.791 --> 31:37.028
No. No.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.697
Whoa.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.932
No.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.134
(gasps)

31:42.167 --> 31:43.501
There.

31:45.171 --> 31:46.404
Oh.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.375
Yeah, pretty
darn lickable.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.741
The other kind of "oh."

31:50.776 --> 31:53.144
That's it.
That's what Tara saw.

31:53.179 --> 31:56.414
Why would Jonathan have the
same mark as the monster?

31:56.448 --> 31:57.749
I don't know,

31:57.782 --> 31:59.417
but he's definitely
keeping this...

31:59.451 --> 32:01.319
JONATHAN:
Is this a private conversation?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.654
Or can Mr. July sit in?

32:03.689 --> 32:04.957
Jonathan.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.058
Hi. Buffy was just saying

32:07.093 --> 32:08.961
how you had a monster
cut up Willow's friend, and...

32:09.996 --> 32:12.263
(mouths)
Buffy?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.500
No.

32:20.105 --> 32:23.275
It's just... The mark.

32:23.308 --> 32:25.911
You said it was safe and...

32:25.943 --> 32:27.613
it wasn't.

32:29.647 --> 32:32.784
I'm sorry. I just
don't understand.

32:34.685 --> 32:36.721
Then I'll explain.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.162
Buffy is right.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.534
No.
I do have
a history

32:48.567 --> 32:51.436
with the creature.
The monster.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.172
The problem is
every time I face it,

32:53.204 --> 32:56.508
my mind becomes
sort of confused.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.609
There's some kind
of power it possesses.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.646
Oh, oh.
He's like your kryptonite.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.449
Maybe.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.384
I just know that
it takes all my energy

33:05.416 --> 33:07.486
to try and fight the confusion.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.688
That's why I had his mark
tattooed on me,

33:09.721 --> 33:12.057
so that I wouldn't
underestimate it next time.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.662
This does explain everything.

33:16.694 --> 33:18.730
I knew he wouldn't
do anything on purpose.

33:18.763 --> 33:20.231
Me too.
And that whole

33:20.266 --> 33:23.102
alternate universe thing
was too freaky.

33:24.769 --> 33:27.373
Jonathan, let's
go after the monster.

33:27.405 --> 33:28.973
Right now. You and me.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.675
Well, I'm sure
it's left town by now.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.077
That's been its pattern.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.979
We can try.

33:34.011 --> 33:36.815
Sure.

33:36.847 --> 33:39.285
Let's do that.

33:41.252 --> 33:42.887
ANYA:
Good-bye, Jonathan.

33:42.921 --> 33:44.289
Good-bye.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.164
Oh, look.

33:53.199 --> 33:55.000
Jonathan.

33:55.032 --> 33:58.703
Taking the little sidekick
out for a walk, are we?

33:58.737 --> 33:59.938
Shut up, Spike.

33:59.971 --> 34:03.842
Ooh, semi-harsh
language from Betty.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.912
You're feisty when the big guy's
standing beside you.

34:07.878 --> 34:09.347
(sighs)

34:09.380 --> 34:10.882
Someday,

34:10.916 --> 34:14.085
sweet slayer...

34:14.119 --> 34:17.722
I would love to take you on.

34:17.755 --> 34:21.559
See you face the evil
alone for once.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.032
That's enough
of the creepy small talk.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.800
We're looking for a monster.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.601
Why would I know about that?

34:30.635 --> 34:32.103
Every demon in this town's
gunning for you right now,

34:32.137 --> 34:33.905
so I figure
you're probably keeping

34:33.938 --> 34:37.543
pretty good track of 'em.
Big arms, mark on its head.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.043
Have you seen it?

34:39.077 --> 34:42.780
No. But then again,
I'm probably lying.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.855
We're not getting
anything out of him.

34:51.922 --> 34:54.126
(grunts)
Hey, what are you doing?!

34:54.159 --> 34:55.661
You're not supposed to do that.

34:55.693 --> 34:57.228
You're pretty much
relying on

34:57.262 --> 34:59.097
butcher's blood
these days, right, Spike?

34:59.130 --> 35:00.931
What are you saying?

35:00.965 --> 35:02.400
Just that the
butchers in this town

35:02.434 --> 35:04.503
respect Jonathan.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.438
They do him a favor,
and you might find yourself

35:07.472 --> 35:09.340
getting kind of thirsty.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.650
Well, look, I don't
know much, okay?

35:19.684 --> 35:22.019
Some vampires got kicked out
of a cave in the hills

35:22.052 --> 35:24.789
behind Brookside Park.

35:24.822 --> 35:26.592
I don't know what
did the kicking out,

35:26.625 --> 35:28.193
but it was probably
pretty big...

35:30.961 --> 35:33.798
That was very good.

35:33.831 --> 35:35.833
Very good.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.670
These spells--
these really work?

35:39.704 --> 35:43.474
I mean, can you really
turn your enemies inside out

35:43.509 --> 35:47.878
or learn to excrete gold coins?

35:47.913 --> 35:49.715
That one's not so much fun.

35:49.748 --> 35:52.050
They work, Riley,
but they take concentration,

35:52.083 --> 35:54.619
being attuned with
the forces of the universe.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.021
Right, you can't
just go...

35:56.054 --> 35:58.889
"Librum incendere"

35:58.923 --> 36:00.259
and expect...

36:03.262 --> 36:05.764
Xander, don't speak Latin
in front of the books.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.134
Hey. I-I found the mark.

36:09.166 --> 36:12.371
It's part of an
augmentation spell.

36:12.403 --> 36:15.373
Jonathan
did an augmentation spell.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.646
What, um, did he have,
uh, you know...

36:20.679 --> 36:23.514
Him. And how we see him.

36:23.548 --> 36:26.418
This spell turns the sorcerer
into a sort of paragon--

36:26.452 --> 36:30.222
the best of everything,
everyone's ideal.

36:30.255 --> 36:32.157
But there's a drawback.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.525
A drawback?

36:33.559 --> 36:35.159
That happens a lot.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.027
Yes, in order to balance
the new force of good,

36:37.061 --> 36:40.065
the spell has to create
the opposing force of evil--

36:40.097 --> 36:42.568
the worst of everything,
everyone's nightmare.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.335
He created the monster.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.505
So we're saying he did a spell

36:46.538 --> 36:48.773
just to make us
think he was cool?

36:48.806 --> 36:50.175
Yes.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.911
That is so cool.

36:52.943 --> 36:54.280
Giles, Buffy
and Jonathan

36:54.313 --> 36:56.248
are going after
this nightmare thing.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.016
Are they gonna be okay?

36:58.048 --> 37:00.018
Well, it seems that
the well-being of this creature

37:00.050 --> 37:03.121
is linked to Jonathan.
I-It dies, the spell is broken

37:03.153 --> 37:04.922
and Jonathan reverts to...

37:04.956 --> 37:06.492
whatever he was before.

37:08.260 --> 37:12.063
Jonathan isn't gonna
want Buffy to get very far.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.248
Wow.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.583
Fall down there and
be dead for a while.

37:32.617 --> 37:35.621
Yeah...

37:35.653 --> 37:38.155
don't want that to happen.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.398
Come on.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.833
We've got a monster to...

37:48.867 --> 37:50.835
(roars)

37:57.608 --> 37:59.010
Buffy was right.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.813
Buffy was right.

38:02.847 --> 38:04.416
Doesn't sound
very likely, does it?

38:04.449 --> 38:06.818
RILEY:
So if this is
the world he created,

38:06.851 --> 38:07.985
what's the real world like?

38:08.018 --> 38:11.690
I'm scared. Everything's
gonna change.

38:11.722 --> 38:14.025
Well, actually, it will
remain pretty much the same,

38:14.059 --> 38:16.795
except that Jonathan
won't be Jonathan.

38:16.827 --> 38:18.764
Well, not our Jonathan, anyway.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.365
XANDER:
No, no, no.

38:20.398 --> 38:21.967
World without sunshine.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.601
World without joy.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.170
RILEY:
But wait-- it only

38:25.202 --> 38:27.038
changes back
if Buffy kills this thing.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.773
I mean, if she loses,

38:28.806 --> 38:31.175
then we could be stuck
in this wrong world forever.

38:31.208 --> 38:33.344
Things looking up.

38:33.378 --> 38:36.280
I mean, we're
all happy here, right?

38:36.313 --> 38:38.817
You know, if she doesn't
get killed.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.387
Giles, can Buffy do it?

38:41.420 --> 38:43.688
I-I honestly don't know.

38:43.722 --> 38:47.324
She's never stood alone against
something like this before.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.360
(thumping, roaring)

38:50.561 --> 38:53.197
(grunting)

39:01.940 --> 39:03.809
Jonathan,
what do I do?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.710
I think you're gonna
have to handle this one solo.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.478
What? But how?

39:07.512 --> 39:09.246
You'll know. You used to.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.717
And the more you hurt it,
the more I'll lose my...

39:12.751 --> 39:13.851
What? Lose your...

39:17.389 --> 39:18.757
Whoa...

39:28.967 --> 39:30.268
I remember this.

39:30.300 --> 39:32.070
This good.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.425
(roaring)

39:56.561 --> 39:58.463
(whimpering)

40:10.742 --> 40:12.744
(indistinct conversations)

40:14.244 --> 40:16.246
I can't believe
we believed it.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.548
It seemed so real.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.050
Well, in that world,
it was real.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.454
Alternate realities
are neat.

40:22.487 --> 40:24.489
You know what
I'll always remember?

40:24.523 --> 40:28.126
Well, the swimsuit calendar's
sticking in my mind.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.427
Not in a good way.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.396
I'll always
remember the way

40:31.429 --> 40:33.465
he made me feel about me--

40:33.498 --> 40:37.302
valued and respected,
sort of tingly,

40:37.335 --> 40:39.570
And now I'm just...

40:39.605 --> 40:41.139
empty.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.740
Poor Xander.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.842
I guess Jonathan
hurt you most of all.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.143
Um...

40:46.177 --> 40:47.978
Except, of course,
after Tara.

40:48.012 --> 40:50.014
RILEY:
Did anyone else
feel way too tall?

40:50.047 --> 40:51.849
I felt way too tall.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.152
XANDER:
I liked his clothes.

40:54.184 --> 40:56.922
He had
really cool clothes.

40:56.954 --> 41:00.025
WILLOW:
I still don't understand how he
got the house and everything.

41:00.057 --> 41:02.092
And who really did
star in The Matrix?

41:02.126 --> 41:05.030
RILEY:
Wait, that wasn't real either?

41:06.697 --> 41:10.034
I... I wasn't sure
you'd come over.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.369
Everyone's mostly forgetting,

41:12.402 --> 41:14.304
but I think some people

41:14.338 --> 41:15.873
are kind of angry.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.809
Yeah.

41:18.844 --> 41:21.211
Nobody's even talking to me.

41:21.246 --> 41:24.349
And the twins moved out.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.050
Why did you do it, anyway?

41:26.083 --> 41:29.454
No, I get why. How?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.789
Well, after the thing
with the bell tower and the gun,

41:31.822 --> 41:33.458
I went to counseling.

41:33.490 --> 41:35.226
You know, other kids
with problems,

41:35.260 --> 41:38.530
and one of them had this spell.

41:38.563 --> 41:40.264
He glossed
right over the monster.

41:41.431 --> 41:43.735
Well, anyway, I just...

41:43.768 --> 41:46.871
I-I just wanted to apologize.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.539
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

41:48.574 --> 41:52.409
Jonathan, you get why everyone
is angry, though, right?

41:52.443 --> 41:54.813
It's not just the monster.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.148
People didn't like being
the little actors

41:57.181 --> 41:58.916
in your sock puppet theater.

41:58.949 --> 42:02.887
You weren't.
You weren't socks.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.755
We were friends.

42:04.789 --> 42:07.257
Jonathan, you can't keep trying
to make everything work out

42:07.291 --> 42:10.494
with some big gesture
all at once.

42:10.527 --> 42:12.864
Things are complicated.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.800
They take time and work.

42:16.735 --> 42:19.204
Yeah.

42:19.237 --> 42:21.072
Right.

42:22.773 --> 42:25.175
Hey-hey, Buffy...

42:25.210 --> 42:27.579
you remember
I gave you some advice?

42:27.612 --> 42:29.179
Watch out for southpaws?

42:29.213 --> 42:31.548
Uh, no. A-About you and Riley.

42:31.583 --> 42:35.052
I mean, things are kind
of starting to blur,

42:35.085 --> 42:37.121
but this cool thing I said--

42:37.155 --> 42:40.358
um, that I don't
really remember--

42:40.391 --> 42:42.793
I think it's right.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.596
I think it's
kind of the same thing

42:44.630 --> 42:46.297
you just said to me.

42:50.135 --> 42:51.568
About things taking work?

42:53.605 --> 42:56.273
Yeah. I remember.

42:56.306 --> 42:58.443
Good.

42:58.476 --> 43:00.746
Because it's true.

43:00.778 --> 43:03.114
What you have
is really complicated,

43:03.148 --> 43:05.349
but it's worth it.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.588
I think that's what I said.

43:26.137 --> 43:28.940
I'm glad we talked
this all out.

43:30.976 --> 43:33.644
We haven't talked at all.

43:33.679 --> 43:35.512
Oh.

43:35.545 --> 43:39.150
Well, whatever we're doing,
we're doing it great.

43:44.856 --> 43:47.291
Mmm, Jonathan.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.597
Grr. Argh.
