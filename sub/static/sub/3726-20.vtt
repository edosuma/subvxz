Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:03.330 --> 00:05.366
I have an eyewitness
from The Two Crows Diner.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.038
You fit the description,
and I'd like it

00:07.070 --> 00:08.799
if you come in for a line-up.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.263
I spoke to Jillian
this morning.

00:11.310 --> 00:13.198
I sort of ended up
pitching you as co-writer.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.377
Jillian approved the book.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.105
- That's amazing.
- That's great.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.242
I think the person
the cops should

00:17.280 --> 00:19.111
really be talking to
is right over there.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.812
[instrumental music]

00:21.850 --> 00:23.442
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you want.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.378
Can you believe
that it's been three years

00:25.420 --> 00:26.250
since we were in Madrid?

00:26.290 --> 00:28.053
- That's crazy.
- Were you looking to--

00:28.090 --> 00:30.285
Get married. Tonight.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.456
What is happenin'?

00:31.490 --> 00:32.798
[explosion]

00:32.830 --> 00:34.457
- Oh, my God!
- Aria!

00:34.500 --> 00:35.797
Have either of you
heard of a restaurant

00:35.830 --> 00:37.263
called The Two Crows?

00:37.300 --> 00:39.530
Is anybody in there? Hello?

The pull-up handle
is missing a rod.

00:47.510 --> 00:49.808
It could've been used as a
weapon to crack someone's neck.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.738

00:52.780 --> 00:54.509
(Emily)
Sara Harvey
wants this murder solved.

00:54.550 --> 00:57.144
And whoever this was...
they want to cover It up.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.680
There's now more than
one person after us?

00:58.720 --> 01:02.679
- When did you take this one?
- 'Wait, there's more.‘

01:02.730 --> 01:04.652
Oh, my God!

01:04.690 --> 01:06.351
Was it you?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.697
Did you call Charlotte
that night

01:07.730 --> 01:08.799
from The Two Crows Diner?

01:08.830 --> 01:10.297
Emily, I can't
talk about this here.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.469
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.335
[horn blaring]

01:21.840 --> 01:23.376
I called Charlotte
the night she was killed.

01:23.410 --> 01:24.877
- Why?
- I asked her to meet me.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.811
- At the church?
- At The Two Crows.

01:27.850 --> 01:30.614
I_ sat in that diner
waiting for two hours.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.288
She never showed up.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.787
Look, if someone saw me
on the phone, they saw me

01:33.820 --> 01:35.583
sitting there by myself
with a cup of coffee

01:35.620 --> 01:36.882
and a slice of apple pie.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.524
Was that your only time
at The Two Crows?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.755
[scoffs]
Last Friday night
someone tried

01:41.800 --> 01:43.791
_ to run _me over
In the parking lot there.

01:43.830 --> 01:46.196
I was still working
for Yvonne's mother then.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.458
Making phone calls in a room
with half dozen volunteers.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.309
You wanted
Charlotte released.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.331
That's why you had a change
of heart in the hearing.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.473
You were afraid Aria's story
would convince the judge

01:54.510 --> 01:56.341
to keep her in the hospital,
where you couldn't get to her.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.268
I wasn't trying
to get to her.

01:58.310 --> 02:00.642
I just wanted to talk to her,
away from everyone else.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.147
- You understand that.
- Sure.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.339
After the special attention
you got

02:03.390 --> 02:04.618
at the bottom
of a certain hole.

02:04.650 --> 02:05.787
Not just me, Emily.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.481
Charlotte DiLaurentis
knew everything

02:07.520 --> 02:08.316
about every one of us.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.659
Every mistake,
every lie, every crime.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.226
And she never implicated us

02:13.260 --> 02:15.148
the five years
she was locked up.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.792
She just sat in that hospital

02:16.830 --> 02:19.333
ticking like a time bomb.

02:19.370 --> 02:21.930
And what would you have done
if she'd shown up?

02:21.970 --> 02:24.268
Find out what she was gonna do
with all her new freedom.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.175
And if she said
she was gonna tell everything

02:26.210 --> 02:28.735
were you just gonna sit there
eating your apple pie?

02:28.780 --> 02:30.907
Or maybe you were thinking about
doing something to stop her.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.645
Doesn't matter
what I was thinking.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.819
The fact is,
she never showed up.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.638
I'll drive you back.

02:38.690 --> 02:41.454
What if it had been you?

02:41.490 --> 02:42.889
What if you called her
and she showed up?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.682
What would you have done?

[birds chirping]

[dramatic music]

03:14.820 --> 03:18.278
Mona basically told you
she was ready to kill Charlotte.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.890
Yeah, but she didn't, because
Charlotte never showed up.

03:20.930 --> 03:23.319
Not guilty because
the victim didn't show?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.928
'That's setting the bar
pretty low, Em.'

03:24.970 --> 03:26.528
Innocent, guilty, whatever

03:26.570 --> 03:28.492
she admits to being
the brunette on the phone.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.633
Let-let's tell Tanner this, so
I can get off the suspect list.

03:30.670 --> 03:33.230
- So do you think she's lying?
- Pick a topic.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.702
About Charlotte
not meeting her that night.

03:34.740 --> 03:37.709
That's probably true.
It's too easy to check.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.672
While you two are
discussing this, let's remember

03:39.720 --> 03:41.574
that I was the one
that was in a line-up.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.986
Alright? It's really
unflattering lighting there.

03:44.020 --> 03:46.011
- So what, do we wait?
- For what?

03:46.050 --> 03:47.859
Whoever this is
wants us to hand over

03:47.890 --> 03:49.380
Charlotte's killer
before election night.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.988
- And they're getting impatient.
- Yeah?

03:51.030 --> 03:52.588
Well, does anyone
wanna put some ointment

03:52.630 --> 03:54.757
on that impatience?

03:54.800 --> 03:57.360
Look, a free-range Mona is more
likely to lead us someplace.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.493
Especially if she thinks
we believe her.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.830
So, we believe her?

04:02.870 --> 04:04.633
We believe her enough.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.639
[instrumental music]

04:12.380 --> 04:14.018
I just think it's a good idea
to stay in Rosewood

04:14.050 --> 04:16.280
a little while longer.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.811
Well, I'll meet them
when I get back.

04:18.850 --> 04:19.885
Well, then I'll meet them

04:19.920 --> 04:22.753
the next time
they're In New York.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.951
Look, Tanner wants us to stay.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.356
Well, your lawyers are there,
and I'm here

04:28.400 --> 04:30.664
so I have to go with my gut.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.759
Well, ifI was in New York,
all I'd be thinking about

04:32.800 --> 04:35.598
is Aria and the others.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.006
[sighs]
Because they're my friends,
Jordan.

04:39.710 --> 04:42.304
Yes. You know I do.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.910
Alright, I'll call you later.
I love you.

04:44.950 --> 04:46.315
[cell phone beeps]

04:47.580 --> 04:49.741
So do I get an invitation
to the wedding?

04:49.790 --> 04:50.779
Of course, you do.

04:50.820 --> 04:51.809
I was half expecting

04:51.850 --> 04:53.386
to meet Jordan when I got here.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.388
Yeah, well, he's a little phobic
of small towns.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.729
He thinks they exist
only to escape from.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.899
Mm-hmm. I used to think that.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.022
What changed your mind?

05:01.060 --> 05:02.960
[scoffs]
Big cities.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.495
Oh, um, I picked up a few ties

05:06.540 --> 05:08.360
that could go with the shirts
I saw in your closet.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.799
You did not have to do that.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.001
Well, it's just a little thank
you for letting me stay here.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.429
Oh, and I put Post-its
on what goes with what.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.778
_ Terrific.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.573

05:18.610 --> 05:21.670
Okay, so,
I checked out the system

05:21.720 --> 05:23.540
and upgraded the firmware

05:23.590 --> 05:25.546
and I took
the fireplace off-line

'till I could replace
this controller.‘

05:27.890 --> 05:28.879

05:28.920 --> 05:29.921
I don't know what happened

05:29.960 --> 05:30.949
but it will not happen again

05:30.990 --> 05:31.979
Lucas, you didn't have

05:32.030 --> 05:33.429
to come back for that.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.893
I wouldn't have,
but I had to be here anyway.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.420
I'm checking out
some property.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.767
- A house?
- 'No.‘

05:37.800 --> 05:40.496
Those empty factories
and mills past the lake.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.701

to spend money

ifI can do something'

05:46.740 --> 05:48.901

a little bit of tax revenue.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.443
Aww, local boy makes good.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.745
Yeah. A little of that.

05:54.780 --> 05:57.419
Maybe I'm giving this town
a second chance.

05:57.450 --> 05:58.644
I know what you mean.

05:58.690 --> 06:00.578
When we finally got out of here,
it was so fast

06:00.620 --> 06:02.759
we didn't really realize
what we left behind.

06:02.790 --> 06:05.520
[instrumental music]

06:06.800 --> 06:09.519
So I will bring
the new controller tonight.

06:09.570 --> 06:13.495
Anything that Aria needs,
just give me a call. Okay?

06:13.540 --> 06:14.495

06:28.550 --> 06:30.711

what we were doing up here.

People will know exactly
what we were doing here.

[instrumental music]

06:37.990 --> 06:39.855
What do you wanna do today?

I was thinking
that we could find a lake

06:42.130 --> 06:46.066
or a river and sit
on the bank and read.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.499
Or not read.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.167
I'll dig up
a French impressionist

09:17.350 --> 09:18.647
It's 60 if you count

09:18.690 --> 09:20.282
what happened to Emily's eggs.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.787
Well, the odds
aren't gonna get any better

09:21.820 --> 09:23.151
the closer we get
to election night.

09:23.190 --> 09:24.680
Three days.

09:26.390 --> 09:28.824
Hey, so Ali's hospital
is an hour away.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.293
I think I'm gonna go
check up on her.

09:30.330 --> 09:31.968
She says
she'll be back tomorrow.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.730
Maybe she should think about
going in the opposite direction.

09:34.770 --> 09:37.659
Yeah, check on her,
but don't freak her out.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.268
And it might be best
if she stays away

09:39.310 --> 09:41.801
until after the election.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.741
- What do we do about Mona?
- Keep a close eye on her.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.317
You guys, Mona did not
kill Charlotte. She couldn't.

09:47.350 --> 09:50.148
She's got as much motive
as anybody. Probably more.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.317
(Emily)
'She admits to getting Charlotte
out of her house.‘

09:52.350 --> 09:55.012
I mean, she's telling the truth,
just not all of it.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.652
Mona's changed so many times

09:56.690 --> 09:57.918
I doubt she even knows herself
when she looks in the mirror.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.359
Okay, who around here
hasn't tried

09:59.390 --> 10:01.096
to reinvent themselves
a couple of tImes?

10:01.130 --> 10:03.223
* For the rest of my life

10:03.270 --> 10:06.228
* I'll be living for you.. *

10:06.270 --> 10:08.591
I'll call you
after I go see Ali.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.862
Uh, yeah, I will
talk to Aria about it

10:11.910 --> 10:14.674
'but, um,
I will certainly be there.‘

10:15.440 --> 10:18.648
Seven? Yeah, absolutely.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.716
Alright, bye-bye.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.047
Hey.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.843
Check with Aria about what?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.414
Your boss _
wants to buy us dInner.

10:25.450 --> 10:28.089
Jillian? Wh-where? When?

10:28.120 --> 10:29.656
Tonight. At The Radley.

10:29.690 --> 10:32.227
- She was on her way to Toronto.
- Through Pennsylvania?

10:32.260 --> 10:34.649
Yeah, uh, I think she
wants to see what she's buying.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.998
- Already?
- Oh, no, not the book.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.258
The authors.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.359
- Oh.
- Don't worry about it.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.063
Oh._..this is
new terrItory for me.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.099
Hey, you're doing great.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.370
Um...I may have

10:47.410 --> 10:49.071
dropped the ball.

10:49.110 --> 10:51.271
What do you mean?

10:51.310 --> 10:53.642
I didn't get this right.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.744
Oh, this is the part
where they say goodbye

10:58.790 --> 11:00.382
where he drives off
and looks back at her.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.751
I thought you liked this.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.428
Yeah, I-I liked it
when we wrote it

11:03.460 --> 11:04.779
but not so much
when I read it.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.422
I-is it the part that I wrote?

11:06.460 --> 11:08.291
No-no, it's, um..

11:08.330 --> 11:10.662
Uh, uh, I-I set this up wrong.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.332
Alright, well, I-I might
be a little prejudiced

11:14.370 --> 11:17.032
but I think it's lovely.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.038
Yeah, it is.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.468
Okay, why don't you
work on this?

11:22.510 --> 11:24.774
I've got a lot
to keep me busy.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.779
Um, just, at least figure out
what's bothering you about it.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.048
Okay, I'm gonna
try something. Um..

11:29.080 --> 11:31.344
I'm gonna do it
in the other room.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.955
[instrumental music]

11:37.360 --> 11:38.679
[door opens]

11:40.360 --> 11:41.691
[door closes]

11:42.300 --> 11:44.120
[telephone ringing]

11:44.170 --> 11:46.968
[inhales deeply]
So did you feel dizzy
or anything?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.331
No, I felt fine.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.099
All of a sudden,
my feet were there

11:50.140 --> 11:52.438
but the stairs weren't.

11:52.470 --> 11:56.748
- I'm so sorry, Ali.
- It was just a stupid accident.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.338
Do you like
my honeymoon lingerie?

11:58.380 --> 12:01.019
[chuckles]
You look great.

12:01.050 --> 12:03.018
Hey, what are
the doctors saying?

12:03.050 --> 12:05.211
They want me to stay
because of the concussion

12:05.250 --> 12:06.956
but they'll spring me tomorrow.

12:06.990 --> 12:09.481
- Back to the bridal suite?
- Back to Rosewood.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.354
Elliott got a call
for a conference in Chicago.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.856
They want him on the panel.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.959
You're gonna be in Rosewood
by yourself?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.319
I don't mind.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.099
For the first time..

12:20.140 --> 12:22.438
...that house_
really feels lIke mIne.

12:23.870 --> 12:25.963
God, all these flowers.

12:26.010 --> 12:28.376
Did you fall down some stairs
or enter the Rose Parade?

12:28.410 --> 12:30.947
[chuckles]
Elliott sent them.

12:30.980 --> 12:31.947
All of them?

12:31.980 --> 12:34.244
He's working on his
husband creds.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.840
- Oh! Hi, newleed.
- Hanna.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.017
'Thank you so much for coming.'

12:39.050 --> 12:41.416
We stick together,
you should know that by now.

12:45.190 --> 12:48.489
Th_ese flowers
are gettIng a “We much.

12:48.530 --> 12:49.997
Well, that's the goal.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.566
[Alison chuckles]
We're not gonna be able

12:51.600 --> 12:52.897
to take all these home.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.567
Well, we can distribute..

12:54.600 --> 12:57.899
[music continues]

12:59.270 --> 13:02.205
[intense music]

13:11.320 --> 13:14.255
[beeping]

13:16.460 --> 13:17.427
- Hey.
- Hey!

13:17.460 --> 13:19.781
I want you to see something.

13:23.530 --> 13:25.828
'Is that who I think it is?‘

13:27.040 --> 13:29.964
[intense music]

13:32.010 --> 13:34.934
Sara Harvey's helping hand.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.973
What's Mona doing with him?

13:41.080 --> 13:42.843
Good question.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.482
[crow cawing]

13:49.930 --> 13:51.579
Mona left him
sitting on the bench.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.291
Couple minutes later
he got up and went inside.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.195
You didn't hear anything
that she said to him?

13:55.230 --> 13:57.095
No, I was too far away.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.927
But what is Mona
doing with Sara's driver?

13:58.970 --> 14:01.962
Well, I doubt she's asking him
for a ride to the airport.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.558
It was a meeting
of the minions.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.908
Yeah, could be.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.146
Did he go in there
with that tube?

14:10.180 --> 14:11.579
No, he didn't.

14:11.610 --> 14:14.909
[intense music]

14:15.980 --> 14:18.448
I really wanna thank you
for coming.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.117
We weren't expecting it.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.479
Well, no one likes
to be in a hospital

14:21.520 --> 14:23.283
especially away from home.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.321
Um, this place is okay,
is it?

14:25.360 --> 14:26.918
You mean the hospital? Yeah.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.928
I checked out the staff.
Ali's getting the best.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.621
I'm probably
overreacting a bit

14:30.670 --> 14:32.319
but I figure that's
part of my job now.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.190
And her concussion,
they're gonna check on her.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.537
Right? They're not
gonna leave her alone?

14:35.570 --> 14:37.208
They check on her
and I'm with her

14:37.240 --> 14:38.229
most of the time.

14:38.270 --> 14:39.339
Good.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.235
I'm just starting to understand

14:41.280 --> 14:43.168
how loyal you are to Alison.

14:43.210 --> 14:46.600
The way you look out
for each other, it's remarkable.

14:46.650 --> 14:47.674
Yeah, well,
we're all connected

14:47.720 --> 14:50.484
like a big bowl of linguini.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.114
Um, if she needs anything,
call me.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.479
I will.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.626
[instrumental music]

15:00.700 --> 15:03.168
[indistinct chattering]

15:03.700 --> 15:05.998
[intense music]

15:07.300 --> 15:09.894
- Let me go get my car.
- No, just wait a minute.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.974
(Emily)
Now what?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.442
Look, we can follow him
around all day

15:21.480 --> 15:23.983
but it's not gonna tell us
what's inside that tube.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.018
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.561
Oh, my God. Is this your car?
We are so sorry.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.261
This is entirely my fault.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.029
(Emily)
'It's totally her fault.
I was trying to park.‘

15:43.070 --> 15:44.162
And she was talking to me.
And we just crashed.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.734
You were asking me
a question and I was--

15:45.770 --> 15:47.374
- It's nothing. Don't worry.
- No, no, seriously.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.469
No, no, no.
I'm taking full responsibility.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.273
I feel terrible.
She feels terrible.

15:51.310 --> 15:52.971
Just don't say it's okay
if it's not.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.373
- It's okay.
- No, it's really not. Please.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.149
Will you just take a good look.
I'm willing to pay for it.

15:56.180 --> 15:57.442
I just want you to take
a good look and make sure

15:57.490 --> 15:59.048
that there's
no real damage done.

15:59.090 --> 16:01.058
Yeah, I mean, this is, like,
my first accident ever

16:03.030 --> 16:04.486
and Ijust,
I really wanna make sure

16:04.530 --> 16:05.519
that you take a good look
and tell me

16:05.560 --> 16:07.699
that there's no real damage.

16:07.730 --> 16:09.049
"Cause, you know,
insurance and everything'

16:09.100 --> 16:11.091
'can get a little expensive..'

16:11.130 --> 16:12.324
'I mean, I know how much
my car means to me'

16:12.370 --> 16:14.736
and I'm sure
you feel the same way, and..

16:14.770 --> 16:19.161
Hey, is this suit Italian?
It's really soft.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.700
I'd really like it if we
could just solve this here

16:20.740 --> 16:22.503
so we wouldn't
have to drag It on.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.440
It's nothing. I mean it.
Don't worry.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.778
You have no idea how happy
I am to hear you say that.

16:26.810 --> 16:29.449
- So sorry.
- I'm sorrier than she is.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.444
Have a good rest of your day.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.980
- Bye.
- Bye!

16:36.120 --> 16:38.452
- Do you think he remembered us?
- No, it didn't seem like it.

16:39.730 --> 16:41.095
So did you find anything?

16:41.130 --> 16:43.018
Yeah, all roads
lead back to Radley.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.129
- You're kidding.
- You keep following our friend.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.569
I'm gonna go back to city hall
and see ifI can get

16:46.600 --> 16:47.589
a copy of what's in that tube.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.289
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:49.340 --> 16:52.264
[intense music]

16:59.310 --> 17:00.413
[vehicle honking]

17:13.430 --> 17:16.354

17:18.600 --> 17:20.659
(Nicole)
I thought I could go,
but I can't. I'm sorry.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.588
(Ezra)
No. No, no.
But we-we planned this.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.528
I should have left yesterday,
but I was waiting for you.

17:24.570 --> 17:26.265
(Nicole)
Yeah, I know,
but Blanca is sick.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.732
I said I'd help
with the kids, so..

17:27.780 --> 17:29.634
But Blanca was taking care
of those kids

17:29.680 --> 17:31.739
a long time before we showed up.

17:31.780 --> 17:34.078
Yeah, I know,
but, baby, I promised.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.577
- Don't be selfish.
- I.. I'm not being selfish.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.440
Yeah, you are.

17:39.690 --> 17:42.318
Hey, what's wrong?

17:42.360 --> 17:44.419
I really wanted
to take you to the coast.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.155
[birds chirping]

17:46.190 --> 17:48.454
To all the glamor
that is Lisiado Bay?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.525
Y-y-yeah, Nicole,
hot water

17:50.570 --> 17:52.492
and a whole bathtub
full of it.

17:53.770 --> 17:55.635
Okay, it's really,
really tempting

17:55.670 --> 17:58.309
but I made a promise.

17:58.340 --> 18:00.501
You'll be back in three days.
Don't be a baby.

18:00.540 --> 18:03.373
- Don't say that.
- It's just a phrase.

18:03.410 --> 18:05.776
(Ezra)
Don't call me a baby
when I just wanna

18:07.920 --> 18:10.844
in a room that has
a lock and a floor.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.484
- Ezra..
- Hey, 1-1 have an idea.

18:14.890 --> 18:17.324
Just get in the jeep.
Just get in the jeep.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.782
(Ezra)
Please, please
just get in the jeep.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.297
[Nicole chuckling]

18:21.500 --> 18:23.764
I can't. I can't. I can't.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.223
You can't or you won't?

18:26.270 --> 18:28.431
Oh, come on.
Don't make it like that.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.174
Okay. Yeah, forget it.

18:33.210 --> 18:35.474
Are you gonna drive
the next six hours angry at me?

18:35.510 --> 18:38.877
- Yeah, probably.
- Ezra, don't go like this.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.470
(Ezra)
IfI don't leave now,
I won't make it by nightfall.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.284
- Seriously, don't go like this.
- Like what?

18:47.790 --> 18:50.520
- Okay, fine.
- Fine.

18:55.730 --> 18:57.618
[instrumental music]

18:57.670 --> 19:00.764
(Ezra)
'And I got in the jeep
and left.‘

19:00.800 --> 19:03.234
'Made a really big deal
of grinding all the gears'

19:03.270 --> 19:05.534
so she would know
I was still pissed off.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.778
I drove away.

19:08.810 --> 19:11.347
No wave, no last look.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.848
So that's what
really happened.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.417
Yeah. Not very romantic,
is it?

19:19.650 --> 19:21.686
I'm sorry.

19:21.720 --> 19:25.281
You're a bad influence on me.
You make me want to be honest.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.490
So, do we tell it
the way it should've been

19:28.530 --> 19:30.862
or do we tell it
the way it happened?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.560
We tell it the way
that makes the best story.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.307
[intense music]

19:49.450 --> 19:51.589
[kids screaming]

20:15.010 --> 20:16.568
Tell me I'm wrong about that.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.312
Did Alison or Elliott see this?

20:25.350 --> 20:26.908
I'm pretty sure they didn't.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.713
Look, whoever this is
is not gonna wait

20:28.760 --> 20:29.988
until election night.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.351
'They're gonna keep
chipping away at us'

20:31.390 --> 20:33.255
until there's nothing left.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.858
What did you tell the others
about Ali's accident?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.492
Nothing. . .yet.

20:36.530 --> 20:39.419
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Why me?

20:39.470 --> 20:41.688
Because you're the only one
who can help me with this.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.037
What are we talking about?

20:43.070 --> 20:45.868
Look, I thought about this a lot
on the drive home.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.878
The only way to prevent
any more accidents

20:47.910 --> 20:49.730
is to call this creep's bluff.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.748
We have to tell them we're ready
to give them what they want.

20:51.780 --> 20:54.340
Hanna, what they want
is Charlotte's killer.

20:54.380 --> 20:57.019
Right. And that's who
we give them.

20:57.050 --> 20:59.439
[instrumental music]

20:59.490 --> 21:02.550
Well, he didn't go that far
out of town to get ice cream.

21:02.590 --> 21:04.956
No, Sara just didn't want
anybody seeing her get the key.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.299
He probably checked in for her.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.393
Em, uh, let's do this
in person, okay?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.499
Bye.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.768
Hey.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.630
Uh, I was gonna call you.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.831
Um...did you see Ali?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.575
Is she okay?

21:23.610 --> 21:27.376
Yeah, she's okay.
Um, it wasn't an accident.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.984
[sighs]
Sara's back at The Radley.

21:33.020 --> 21:34.783
- When did that happen?
- Today.

21:34.820 --> 21:36.014
She checked in
under a fake name

21:36.060 --> 21:38.051
and she's still
looking for something.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.887
These are plans
for The Radley

21:39.930 --> 21:42.592
same one Sara got
from the records office.

21:45.730 --> 21:49.393
Spence...you need
to listen to Hanna.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.572
[sighs]

21:56.440 --> 21:59.648
That night, at the hotel,
when you were asleep..

22:01.020 --> 22:03.841
...I left the room.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.609
I followed Arai and Ezra.

22:06.650 --> 22:09.016
And I saw them
in the square and then..

22:10.430 --> 22:13.399
...I saw Charlotte
go into the church.

22:14.430 --> 22:17.399
So I went in after her.

22:17.430 --> 22:21.332
She was sitting there.
Alone. Praying.

22:25.410 --> 22:28.004
I picked up a candlestick..

22:28.040 --> 22:29.769
...and I stabbed her

22:29.810 --> 22:32.005
in the back of the neck
with the end of it.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.745
[intense music]

22:33.780 --> 22:36.578
And then I took her to the bell
tower and I threw her off.

22:38.750 --> 22:41.014
I went to the hotel
and pretended

22:41.060 --> 22:43.483
like I was only gone
for a minute to get ice.

22:44.730 --> 22:48.120
[sighs]
Stealing that
security drive

22:48.160 --> 22:50.492
wasn't because Aria was on it.

22:52.430 --> 22:54.591
It's because I'm on it.

22:56.770 --> 22:58.863
[sobbing]
I murdered Charlotte.

22:58.910 --> 23:02.038
[music continues]

23:08.450 --> 23:12.079
See? She believed it.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.156
And if she believed it
even for a minute..

23:15.960 --> 23:18.178
What the hell just happened?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.528
Hanna knows _
how we can end thIs.

23:21.930 --> 23:24.626
[intense music]

23:24.670 --> 23:27.537
[song on player]

23:28.670 --> 23:31.207
I really shouldn't encourage
Aria's writing.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.970
I was hoping to turn her
into a world-class editor.

23:34.010 --> 23:37.776
Well, you missed your chance.
She's already a novelist.

23:37.810 --> 23:39.505
Almost.

23:39.550 --> 23:42.474
I'm curious about the process.
How does it work with you two?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.785
We're still
figuring that out.

23:45.820 --> 23:48.653
Really? I was hoping
you had it down by now.

23:48.690 --> 23:50.829
I have a marketing department
chomping at the bit.

23:50.860 --> 23:53.795
We sort of, uh, spot the corners
of the mat for each other.

23:53.830 --> 23:56.025
Just somebody that
the other person can trust.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.199
Makes it go a lot quicker
than if we were alone.

23:58.230 --> 23:59.766
Quicker is good.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.509
But we're still taking our time
to get it right.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.201
- We don't wanna rush it.
- 'Yeah.‘

24:05.240 --> 24:06.730
A-and I know
that you've been carrying

24:06.770 --> 24:08.032
that advance
for qUIte sometIme--

24:08.080 --> 24:09.536
I didn't come here
to lean on you two.

24:09.580 --> 24:12.071
I came here to buy you dinner
and wish you well..

24:12.110 --> 24:13.714
...and maybe lean
just a little.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.638
I have production decisions
to make for next year

24:15.680 --> 24:16.942
and I don't like
making that kind of commitment

24:16.980 --> 24:20.211
without a manuscript
in my hand. Even a rough one.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.150
I need to see
some kind of complete draft

24:22.190 --> 24:23.748
and I need to see it soon.

24:23.790 --> 24:25.587
Oh, you'll have it.

24:26.030 --> 24:27.224
Good.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.250
[indistinct chattering]

24:30.300 --> 24:32.791
- Whole thing sounds crazy.
- It's not crazy.

24:32.830 --> 24:34.764
- We're building a rat trap.
- And you are the cheese.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.189
We gotta do something unexpected
to knock them off balance.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.834
Okay, so what if she confesses
to killing Charlotte, and A

24:39.870 --> 24:42.100
orders her to march into the
po|Ice statIon and tell Tanner?

24:42.140 --> 24:43.641
You think this person
went to all that trouble

24:43.680 --> 24:44.840
just to hand it over
to the cops?

24:44.880 --> 24:47.098
This is about revenge,
not justice.

24:47.150 --> 24:48.572
- Still sounds--
- 'Crazy. Yes.‘

24:48.620 --> 24:49.973
We've established that,
but Caleb and I

24:50.020 --> 24:51.248
have it all figured out.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.814
[sighs]
What do you think

24:52.850 --> 24:54.249
about all this?

24:55.890 --> 24:57.255
I'm just happy

24:57.290 --> 24:59.224
somebody else
has come up with a plan

24:59.260 --> 25:00.693
'cause I'm all tapped out.

25:00.730 --> 25:03.995
- Can it work?
- Yeah. It can work.

25:04.030 --> 25:06.225
Meanwhile, I'll work things
from the Sara angle

25:06.270 --> 25:08.135
and if we're luclq,
we'll catch A.

25:08.170 --> 25:09.865
If we're lucky.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.005
Hanna has the plan
and Caleb has the know-how.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.132
And if we don't back them up

25:14.180 --> 25:16.273
they're just gonna do it
by themselves.

25:16.310 --> 25:19.848
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

25:19.880 --> 25:23.247
Um, most of what I need
H can take off the shelf

25:23.280 --> 25:24.645
but for the other stuff,
I mean

25:24.690 --> 25:26.908
it really be helpful
if I could talk to Toby.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.251
Spence?

25:29.290 --> 25:30.848
He needs to know
what you're plannIng.

25:30.890 --> 25:33.620
And I wanna show him
those blueprints.

25:33.660 --> 25:35.799
Hey, can I see that list?

25:38.100 --> 25:41.069
Do you think Hanna's aware
of the risk she's taking?

25:41.100 --> 25:42.590
Yeah, Em, she knows.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.029
And you're just gonna let
the two of them run this?

25:45.070 --> 25:47.334
It's their plan.
What do you want me to do?

25:47.370 --> 25:49.679
Wedge myself in between them
on the sofa?

25:55.850 --> 25:56.976
I'm a sort of a hip-hop
[indistinct]

25:57.020 --> 25:59.215
when it comes to e-books.

25:59.250 --> 26:00.615
The thing they
don't want you to know

26:00.660 --> 26:02.082
is how ethereal
the technology IS.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.658
I still think ink on acid-free
paper Is gonna WIn out.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.749
You don't mind if Aria
walks me home, do you?

26:07.800 --> 26:08.994
- Just to the elevators.
- Oh, no.

26:09.030 --> 26:11.999
- Um, I'll meet you outside.
- Okay.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.191
Uh, Jillian,
thank you again for dinner.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.265
Thanks for the book.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.858
I just want to let you know,
from now on

26:17.910 --> 26:19.935
you'll be communicating
with my office directly.

26:19.970 --> 26:22.029
You won't have to go through
Liam on this project.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.344
But I-I've been working
with Liam the whole time.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.678
I know. I had a talk with him
when he came back.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.178
It was clear to me he needed
some dIstance. He agreed.

26:29.220 --> 26:32.849
I think it's what's best for
the book and everybody involved.

26:32.890 --> 26:35.051
Oh...alright.

26:35.090 --> 26:37.115
Are you trying to pretend
I don't know you and Liam

26:37.160 --> 26:39.128
are what used to be called
"An item?"

26:39.160 --> 26:41.754
Give me some credit, Aria.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.358
I guess we could've been
a little more discreet.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.028
You were very discreet,
that's why everybody knows.

26:46.070 --> 26:48.061
'I'm depending on you
to keep things in perspective'

26:48.100 --> 26:49.692
'until the book is finished.‘

26:49.740 --> 26:52.061
After that, you can do what
you like with whomever you like.

26:52.110 --> 26:55.375
But right now, I don't want this
project derailed...by anything.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.332
- I understand.
- 'I hope so.‘

26:57.380 --> 26:59.109
I like your Ezra.
He's smart.

26:59.150 --> 27:02.039
And he can write, and
the talk shows will love him.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.411
'They'll love both of you.'

27:03.450 --> 27:06.385
You and your ex-teacher
are in for quite a ride.

27:06.420 --> 27:09.116
- Goodnight, Aria.
- Goodnight..

27:09.160 --> 27:11.879
[cell phone ringing]

27:13.290 --> 27:16.691
. - Em? .
- ArIa, are you stIII at dInner?

27:16.730 --> 27:19.767
Listen, you need to tell Ezra
what's happening.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.939
I know,
but the situation's changing.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.404
I'm at Spencer's.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.273
Hanna wants to try something.

27:28.310 --> 27:31.143
No, she just left with Caleb.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.738
You need to hear this.

27:32.780 --> 27:33.974
[instrumental music]

27:34.020 --> 27:36.113
'Hanna wants to say
that she killed..'

27:37.990 --> 27:40.914
[music continues]

27:44.860 --> 27:46.350
Of all the paintings
in that museum

27:46.390 --> 27:48.824
why did you wanna
take this one home?

27:48.860 --> 27:49.849
Mm.

27:51.230 --> 27:53.835
This little dog's
been through a lot with me.

27:53.870 --> 27:55.758
'He was on a calendar
in the kitchen'

27:55.800 --> 27:57.768
of one of my foster homes.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.209
It was an old calendar,
wrong year.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.276
Nobody ever took it down

28:01.310 --> 28:03.972
until I did.

28:04.010 --> 28:06.046
This is actually
the only thing I took with me.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.776
I sort of made him
my little dog.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.448
You still have the print?

28:11.490 --> 28:14.414
I left it behind...
in New York.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.219
[music continues]

28:23.260 --> 28:26.969
Well, your little dog
is doing alright for himself.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.232
He's hanging in Prado

28:29.270 --> 28:31.932
people are lining up
to see him..

28:31.970 --> 28:33.835
...buying him
in the gift shop.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.007
Yeah, sometimes
things work out.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.471
I really wanna say thank you
for last night.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.011
For all the adventures,
the museums today

28:46.050 --> 28:47.039
even the bull fight.

28:47.090 --> 28:47.818
[laughing]

28:47.860 --> 28:50.112
- It was all very--
- Chaotic?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.821
No, it was impromptu.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.953
[instrumental music]

28:55.060 --> 28:57.767
- Where do you wanna go?
- For dinner?

28:57.800 --> 28:59.791
No, after Madrid.

28:59.830 --> 29:03.095
Um...I'm not sure.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.732
Maybe Morocco.

29:06.010 --> 29:08.376
God, I enw you.

29:08.410 --> 29:11.106
Ferry ticket
doesn't cost that much.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.106
Yeah, but I've got
to be back in Georgetown

29:13.150 --> 29:14.242
by the end of the month.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.475
Then we'll skip Casablanca.

29:19.450 --> 29:21.179
[dog barking]

29:21.220 --> 29:22.858
[woman speaking
in foreign language]

29:26.490 --> 29:28.799
[both chuckle]

29:30.030 --> 29:32.294
- Hey, it's 10 o'clock.
- Mm.

29:32.330 --> 29:35.094
- Time for dinner.
- Yeah.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.859
[music continues]

29:37.910 --> 29:40.936
[cricket chirping]

29:44.450 --> 29:45.872
Alright, I'll be back
as fast as I can

29:45.910 --> 29:47.207
but, uh, the more
I get done tonight

29:47.250 --> 29:48.274
the less I have to worry.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.447
Right.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.948
Sorry, I just wanted
to make sure that worked

29:52.990 --> 29:55.857
from anywhere in the apartment.

29:55.890 --> 29:59.018
- Hey, Caleb. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

29:59.060 --> 30:01.119
I would ask how you're doing,
but I'm a stockholder

30:01.160 --> 30:03.321
so I already know.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.568
Yeah, well, confidence is high.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.966
- Okay, um, I gotta go.
- Okay.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.605
Oh, do you lunch?
We should do lunch.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.029
- Yeah, I lunch.
- Then we'll lunch.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.036
Okay. Bye.

30:17.910 --> 30:21.539
Okay, you are completely safe.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.445
Thank you.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.118
Hey, what, what is this?

30:25.150 --> 30:27.880
It's the empty factory
I'm buying near the lake.

30:27.920 --> 30:32.129
And this...is what it's gonna
look like when it's finished.

30:32.160 --> 30:36.119
Wow. That's really nice.
What are you gonna do with it?

30:36.160 --> 30:38.162
Anything I want to.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.438
What would you do with it?

30:41.470 --> 30:43.938
Um...indoor miniature golf.

30:43.970 --> 30:47.508
No, seriously,
what would you do?

30:47.540 --> 30:49.337
If somebody said
that you could try anything

30:49.380 --> 30:51.348
you know,
start your own business

30:52.650 --> 30:55.016
Don't kid like that, Lucas.

30:55.050 --> 30:56.972
Who's kidding?

30:59.320 --> 31:01.117
Well, I would set myself up

31:01.160 --> 31:04.379
with some new designers.
Start my own brand.

31:04.430 --> 31:08.218
You know, get out of the city,
away from all the distractions.

31:08.260 --> 31:09.625
Deal.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.628

31:12.670 --> 31:15.195
It can mean _
whatever we say that It means.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.491
Look, this will be
a good way for you

31:16.540 --> 31:18.929
to keep one foot
in Rosewood.

31:18.970 --> 31:21.074
Figure out what you
left behind.

31:24.410 --> 31:28.016
Lucas, I...I can't
take you up on that offer.

31:28.650 --> 31:31.141
Why not? What?

31:31.190 --> 31:33.044
Does somebody else
you went to high school with

31:33.090 --> 31:35.581
wanna offer you
a million-dollar line of credit?

31:37.120 --> 31:38.985
Come on, Hanna.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.998
Look, I finally figured out
a way to give you something

31:41.030 --> 31:43.123
that nobody else can.

31:46.370 --> 31:49.396
Look, the offer still stands.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.328
Ask Jordan about it.

31:51.370 --> 31:54.635
We can talk about it tomorrow
or whenever you want.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.240
Yeah. Tomorrow.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.423
Don't be afraid. Please.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.599
I don't wanna scare you.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.198
I'm dreaming.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.403
Or it's, it's the drugs
or the concussion.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.260
I don't care what it is.

32:26.310 --> 32:29.404
I'm just glad I'm able
to see you, to talk to you.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.969
My little angel.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.576
Mommy.

32:37.620 --> 32:40.043
Everything's gonna
be alright now.

32:40.090 --> 32:42.217
Elliott will
take care of you.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.578
You know about Elliott.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.224
I know he's a good man.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.353
I know he loves you.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.619
And he'll protect you
the way that I wasn't able to.

32:59.640 --> 33:02.234
Rest, darling.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.399
Shh.

(Sara)
'Someone told me
you wanted to talk.'

33:45.420 --> 33:47.308
Hello, Sara.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.409
I saw your driver this morning,
I was curious

33:49.460 --> 33:51.121
how you were doing.

33:51.160 --> 33:55.324
Alright. Everyone has their own
personal way to survive.

33:55.360 --> 33:56.827
Well, when you consider
what we've all been through

33:56.860 --> 33:59.260
it's amazing we're all
functioning so well.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.261
What do you want, Mona?

34:02.300 --> 34:03.289
Leave 'em alone.

34:03.340 --> 34:05.399
Not until I get
what's coming to me.

34:05.440 --> 34:06.839
Charlotte's dead.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.304
You can't get reparations
from a corpse.

34:09.340 --> 34:11.399
You can if you know
where to dig.

34:11.450 --> 34:14.214
[scoffs]
Be careful.

34:14.250 --> 34:15.808
No one blames you
for what Charlotte made you do

34:15.850 --> 34:18.546
but what you do now,
that's all yours.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.616
Poor Mona,
out in the cold.

34:21.660 --> 34:25.118
No matter what you do,
they're never gonna trust you.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.128
You played with them too long.

34:27.160 --> 34:30.152
I'm not playing anything
anymore, okay? No more games.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.395
Then you're gonna be
awfully lonely.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.788
[dramatic music]

34:38.740 --> 34:40.833
Well, so far
I kinda like your boss.

34:40.870 --> 34:44.340
Although I can see
how she can be a bit daunting.

34:44.380 --> 34:47.099
Jillian has daunt
she hasn't even used yet.

34:50.450 --> 34:52.611
What did you guys talk about
in the lobby?

34:52.650 --> 34:54.254
That was work related.

34:54.290 --> 34:56.485
She wants me to go
through the office, not Liam.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.228
- What else?
- Nothing. Really.

35:02.730 --> 35:05.563
Then why have you not
looked me in the eye

35:05.600 --> 35:07.727
since we left the hotel?

35:07.770 --> 35:09.192
[sighs]

35:11.910 --> 35:13.537
It's not about the book.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.435
Emily called me.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.175
Is something wrong?

35:17.210 --> 35:19.542
Alison's in the hospital.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.741
- Is she back? What happened?
- No, she's not back.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.317
She's still away
with Elliott.

35:24.350 --> 35:26.341
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.517
She had an accident,
or what looked like an accident.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.881
The same way that what happened
to me looked like an accident.

35:33.290 --> 35:35.224
Aria, w-what are you
saying exactly?

35:35.260 --> 35:36.818
I'm saying
it's happening again

35:36.860 --> 35:39.226

do something about it.

35:51.810 --> 35:54.517
- Hey.
- I didn't wanna wake you.

35:54.550 --> 35:57.713
That's alright.
I was dreaming.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.911
I came in with good news.

35:59.950 --> 36:02.783
We can go home in the morning.
All tests are clear.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.253
That's good.

36:04.290 --> 36:06.520
And I made up my mind
to cancel Chicago.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.927
No, you have to go.
It's important.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.825
You're important.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.532
Really, I'm gonna be okay now.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.209
I mean it.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.573
Go to the conference
so that when you get back

36:21.610 --> 36:24.477
I can welcome you at the door
and we can have a life.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.748
What happened to you?

36:32.790 --> 36:35.486
Nothing.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.954
Everything.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.686
I had a dream, that's all.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.891
What was in the dream?

36:44.630 --> 36:46.291
I don't want to tell you.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.833
It'll sound silly.

36:48.870 --> 36:52.829
Well, I don't care
what it was

as long as it made you happy.

all that ready in time?

I've already started.
I can have it when we need it.

37:10.890 --> 37:12.528
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

37:12.560 --> 37:14.892
I wouldn't have thought of it
if I wasn't ready to do it.

Look, guys, this isn't
a democracy, okay?

37:20.470 --> 37:21.789
'We're not taking votes.‘

This is something that
Hanna and I decided to do.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.500
And the only thing
that you need to decide is

37:26.540 --> 37:28.633
whether or not
you're gonna help us.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.285
Nobody here is gonna
let you do this by yourself.
