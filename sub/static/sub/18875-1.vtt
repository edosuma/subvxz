WEBVTT

04:24.014 --> 04:25.755
[bell rings]

04:29.186 --> 04:31.644
[indistinct chatter]

04:38.278 --> 04:40.940
Excuse me, miss, could you direct me
to Cletus Summers' office?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.105
- Up the stairs.
- Thank you.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.983
You're not the new coach?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.822
Were you expecting somebody different?

04:47.996 --> 04:50.829
- [chuckles] Younger, I guess.
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.535
Yeah, no, I must've
misunderstood Cletus.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.201
You see, he said he was hiring someone
who'd never coached high school before,

04:55.378 --> 04:57.119
- so, I naturally assumed...
- I coached in college.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.709
And I hear you're our new history
and civics teacher as well.

04:59.883 --> 05:00.873
[chuckles]

05:01.051 --> 05:02.837
That's part of the job
as I understand it.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.718
You have any experience teaching?

05:05.806 --> 05:08.798
Tell me something.
Am I being interviewed here?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.761
I thought I already had the job.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.555
Straight up.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.185
You know, if everyone is as nice as you,

05:14.356 --> 05:16.393
country hospitality is going
to get an awful name.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.728
What a pleasant thing to say.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.907
_ [man] Cletus'?
"Hm? '

05:35.085 --> 05:38.419
- What are you doing down there?
- Floating.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.257
Norman Dale'?

05:48.890 --> 05:52.929
- I hardly recognize you.
- It's been 20 years.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.480
Buffalo State Teachers College,
spring of '31.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.480
You know, I've had a hell of a time
tracking you down.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.611
I didn't know you
were still in the service.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.606
I'm here now. [chuckles]

06:10.787 --> 06:12.824
You really made good time.

06:12.998 --> 06:16.662
Wasn't it just yesterday or the day
before that we settled this thing?

06:16.835 --> 06:18.997
You said practice started last week,

06:19.170 --> 06:21.958
I figured I'd get here
as soon as I could.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.207
It's been a while for you.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.844
Yeah, I really appreciate
what you're doing. I...

06:29.014 --> 06:30.721
Let's not be repeating ourselves.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.176
Your slate's clean here.
We got a job to do.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.721
So come on, coach,
let me show you around.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.230
OK.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.777
This is where it all happens.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.118
It's not exactly what you're used to,
but we're proud of it.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.701
And during the season, we'll put over
800 people in here every Friday night.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.536
When does practice start?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.792
Well, we'll practice at noon this week,

07:00.962 --> 07:03.954
'cause some of the boys gotta
get ready for threshing on Saturday.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.834
Jimmy, I want you to meet someone.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.671
- This is Norman Dale, our new coach.
- Hi.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.893
- Real friendly town you've got here.
- Can be.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.603
Let's go on back out to the farm.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.984
I've got a place fixed up
out there for you.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.861
Get you squared away.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.874
That's it. Thank you.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.590
- Say hello to Chester.
- Hello, Chester.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.001
- Say goodbye to Chester.
- Oh...

07:52.389 --> 07:53.720
You say this kid, Jimmy,

07:53.890 --> 07:56.382
he wouldn't play basketball
after the coach died'?

07:56.559 --> 07:59.142
Well, the coach was kind of
like an old man to him, you know.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.725
The kid never had
any family of his own to speak of.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.692
At least, he comes on down to the school
and shoots them buckets.

08:06.861 --> 08:10.104
Aside from that, he's just about
backed away from everything.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.774
I don't know why you're going on so
about this kid being irreplaceable.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.489
It's my experience
that nobody's irreplaceable.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.872
Well, I think there's something
you don't understand.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.076
Oh?

08:21.251 --> 08:24.664
In over 40 years of looking
at the best this state's ever had...

08:25.714 --> 08:28.422
...I have never seen a better ballplayer
than Jimmy Chitwood.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.752
Never.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.722
I'm glad you're here, Norm.
I think it's gonna work out.

08:38.934 --> 08:42.269
Well, it's gotta work out this time
or that's it for good.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.034
The last time you coached
was 12 years ago?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.161
- Yeah, that's right.
- Where?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.457
That was in Ithaca, New York.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.664
What you been doing since?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.413
I've been in the Navy
for the last ten years.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.252
I was a chief petty officer.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.795
Well...

09:17.807 --> 09:19.764
...lo0ks like you're
going to need a little help.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.597
Since I've been running practices
the last couple of weeks,

09:23.772 --> 09:25.979
I'll help you out
till you get your feet wet.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.807
[man] This town doesn't
like change much,

09:28.985 --> 09:30.396
so we thought
we'd get together here tonight

09:30.570 --> 09:32.436
and show you how we do things here.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.152
[man 2] We trust that you're a fine,
upstanding, God-fearing man

09:36.326 --> 09:38.658
with Christian morals and principles

09:38.828 --> 09:42.742
who'll set an example and a standard
of leadership for our boys.

09:43.666 --> 09:47.159
Tell me, do you believe
in man-to-man or a zone defense?

09:47.337 --> 09:48.827
[laughs]

09:51.007 --> 09:53.044
Zone defense is all
we've played in the past...

09:53.218 --> 09:54.299
- Yeah, that's right.
- ...and it's the only thing

09:54.469 --> 09:56.506
- that'll work this year.
- That's right, George.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.842
- [men chatter in agreement]
- For out there, our boys are too small,

10:00.016 --> 10:02.929
but remember,
we were 15 and 'IO last year

10:03.103 --> 10:05.185
and we got all our boys back but one.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.514
Listen. I ain't interested
in talking defense here,

10:08.691 --> 10:11.023
and I don't have a hair of a notion
why we hired someone

10:11.194 --> 10:13.310
who's been in the water
for the last 10 years.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.195
[men laughing]

10:15.365 --> 10:16.776
Now the main point here is,

10:16.950 --> 10:19.863
we don't get Jimmy Chitwood back
playing ball, we don't have a prayer.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.026
- That's right.
- That's right.

10:21.204 --> 10:24.117
He switches over to Terhune,
we're in big trouble.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.163
[man] Rooster's right, Coach.
Jimmy's the Jack to their...

10:28.336 --> 10:31.954
Gentlemen, it's been
real nice talking to you.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.331
Good night.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.461
[door closes]

10:44.727 --> 10:46.183
Miss Fleener?

10:47.063 --> 10:48.519
Good morning.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.397
I heard the boys weren't real generous
with you last night.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.192
Oh, I keep forgetting there are only
about 50 people in this town.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.451
This hick town, you mean?

11:03.621 --> 11:06.579
- I didn't say that.
- That's what you're thinking, isn't it'?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.826
I thought we were gonna be friends.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.416
[chuckling]

11:20.680 --> 11:22.842
I guess you're gonna
wanna talk about Jimmy.

11:23.016 --> 11:23.972
Why would I?

11:24.142 --> 11:26.474
Certainly you've been told
you can't win without him.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.510
Too many times in the last 24 hours.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.146
- What's it have to do with you?
- I look after him.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.308
His mother's sick and his father
passed away and we're neighbors.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.772
And he and I decided that it's best
for him not to play this...

11:36.946 --> 11:38.903
- I see. That's fine.
- You hear me'? He's not gonna play.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.734
Yes, that's fine.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.445
I'm sure you're gonna be convinced
to go after him.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.782
If I am, you will be the first to know.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.457
OK.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.865
Good morning. Good morning.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.630
[George] Come on. Give me two outside.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.753
Quit throwing the ball around
and shoot it!

11:55.924 --> 11:56.880
Move it!

11:57.050 --> 12:00.884
That's the shot. Outside.
Buddy! Get on the boards!

12:01.471 --> 12:04.054
Nice shot. Rip those nets.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.632
Give me two. Give me two outside.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.141
Get it up there.
You can't score if you don't shoot!

12:09.938 --> 12:11.679
Shoot from outside!
Quit throwing it around.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.233
Get it in the hole!

12:14.275 --> 12:15.606
There you are.

12:15.777 --> 12:20.237
I thought we'd go 20 minutes on,
ten off, and 20 on.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.443
I had a different schedule in mind.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.278
Look, mister, these boys
got a routine they're used to.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.538
You throw a new coach
with newfangled ideas at them,

12:30.708 --> 12:32.494
might get them all confused.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.001
Maybe we'll ease into it real slow.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.538
Hell, their first game's
less than two weeks away.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.706
First of all, let's be
real friendly here, OK?

12:39.884 --> 12:41.261
My name is Norm.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.044
Secondly, your coaching days are over.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.344
Look, mister, there's...

12:49.686 --> 12:52.018
...two kinds of dumb,

12:52.188 --> 12:55.556
a guy that gets naked
and runs out in the snow

12:55.733 --> 12:58.816
and barks at the moon, and uh...

12:59.904 --> 13:02.862
...a guy who does the same thing
in my living room.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.022
The first one don't matter.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.988
The second one
you're kinda forced to deal with.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.572
Translate.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.413
That some sort of threat?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.538
I don't know why Cletus
drug your tired old bones in here.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.003
He must've owed you something fierce.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.967
Fact is, mister,
you start screwing up this team,

13:28.141 --> 13:31.179
I'll personally
hide-strap your ass to a pine rail

13:31.352 --> 13:33.343
and send you up the Monon line.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.849
Leave the ball, will you, George'?

13:41.362 --> 13:42.397
Thank you.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.354
Huddle up.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.656
Let's see what kind of hand
I've been dealt here.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.239
Seven players. That it'?

13:55.126 --> 13:58.084
Six. 'Cause I really don't count.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.999
Why is that?

14:02.342 --> 14:06.256
- I'm too short and I'm not no good.
- [boys laugh]

14:06.429 --> 14:10.047
I suit up for practice to be a body.
Equipment management is my trade.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.266
I thought everybody in Indiana
played basketball.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.770
[boy] Sir, most do,
but not all go out for the team.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.776
We only got 64 boys in the whole school.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.021
It's gonna be a lonely bench.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.312
Well, those of you who don't know,
my name is Norman Dale.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.776
I coached college ball for ten years,

14:26.949 --> 14:28.940
but it's been 12 years
since I've blown this,

14:29.118 --> 14:31.780
so I'm onna be learnin from ou,
99 y just like you learn from me.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.411
I'm gonna be setting up practice

14:33.581 --> 14:34.821
a little bit differently
than you're used to,

14:34.999 --> 14:37.206
but as you'll find out,
everything has its reasons.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.289
Basketball is a voluntary activity.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.339
- It's not a requirement.
- [indistinct whispering]

14:44.509 --> 14:46.671
If any of you feel
you don't want to be on the team,

14:46.844 --> 14:48.801
feel free to leave right now.
Did you hear what I said?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.097
- Me'?
- Yes, you.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.720
Sure. I'm just curious
to know when we start.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.393
We start when I say so.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.470
Would you kinda let me know?
'Cause I'm kinda getting tired of...

14:55.645 --> 14:57.261
All right, out. Out of here. Right now.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.473
- You're kicking me out'?
- Yes.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.231
Don't come back until you learn to
keep your mouth shut and listen.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.649
Break my heart.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.777
Come on, Whit, let's
fly this chicken coop.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.568
Didn't you say you'd rather be
down at Terhune anyway?

15:14.122 --> 15:15.487
It's your funeral.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.698
[boy] Let's move, gizzard.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.331
I ain't no gizzard.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.666
Have fun, Coach,
trying to win with five...

15:23.840 --> 15:26.172
Well, make that four and a half players.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.851
[Norman] OK, let's get those
folding chairs, line them up right here.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.681
About three feet apart.

15:40.731 --> 15:41.857
Go!

15:43.317 --> 15:45.308
Come on, little man!

15:47.238 --> 15:50.026
- Let's move. Come on, let's move.
- But when do we scrimmage?

15:50.199 --> 15:51.906
We don't scrimmage.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.659
- No shooting either.
- That ain't no fun!

15:55.204 --> 15:57.866
My practices aren't designed
for your enjoyment.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.075
Let's go! Let's move!

15:59.250 --> 16:00.911
Come on! I've seen you guys can shoot,

16:01.085 --> 16:03.372
but there's more to the game
than shooting!

16:03.546 --> 16:05.287
There's fundamentals and defense.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.297
Come on, palms up. Palms up.
[claps]

16:08.551 --> 16:12.169
Come on. Come on, pop.
Pop! Get rid of it! Pop!

16:12.346 --> 16:15.134
Get rid of it.
Hot potato, hot potato. Hold it.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.015
- [laughing]
- [Norman] Hold it!

16:17.477 --> 16:18.717
Hold it!

16:19.896 --> 16:21.887
Let's be real clear
about what we're after here.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.852
Wipe that smile off your face.
This is not funny.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.228
The five players on the floor
function as one, single unit.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.114
Team, team, team, right'?

16:33.284 --> 16:35.651
No one more important than the other.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.411
Pop the ball, pop. Get rid of it.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.946
Come on, let's go.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.286
[indistinct shouts]

16:43.503 --> 16:46.837
Come on, big guy! Let's go! Switch!

16:50.593 --> 16:54.086
Pass the ball.
Get rid of it! Get rid of it!

16:54.263 --> 16:55.594
Fire!

17:00.770 --> 17:02.260
Come on, let's go.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.472
Come On, come On, come On, come on!

17:06.526 --> 17:10.440
No team of mine will ever
run out of steam before its opponent.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.817
With only five players,
we can't afford to.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.784
[whistle blows]

17:20.289 --> 17:21.700
[whistle blows]

17:23.584 --> 17:26.747
Come on, that's it.
Let's go! Get the lead out!

17:26.921 --> 17:29.458
Let's move! Let's go!

17:29.840 --> 17:32.127
- Can I help you gentlemen?
- [man] Just checking the boys out.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.212
[man 2] We heard you got
some crazy ways of coaching.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.969
No shooting,
practicing without a ball.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.299
- Come on!
- What's up with that?

17:37.473 --> 17:40.682
[man 3] We got some concern about the
way matters are being handled here.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.683
We're gonna be doing this
every day at practice,

17:42.853 --> 17:44.810
you're gonna be in the best physical
shape of your lives.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.471
Feels like we're in the army.

17:46.649 --> 17:50.108
You are in the army, you're in my army.
Every day between 3:00 and 5:00.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.363
Listen, guys,
practice is closed to outsiders.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.615
- I don't want any distractions at all.
- Outsiders?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.367
- Coach Tidd never closed practices.
- I'm not sure...

17:59.537 --> 18:01.904
That was Coach Tidd.
This is something else now.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.367
Yeah?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.499
Hi. I'm Rollin Butcher.
[clears throat]

18:09.297 --> 18:11.129
My son's got something to say to you.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.673
Sorry, coach, about walking out.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.460
I'd be obliged
if I got myself another chance.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.602
It won't happen again. You're the boss.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.926
OK.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.187
There's still an hour of practice.
Get dressed.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.016
I, uh...

18:31.193 --> 18:33.400
Boys get a little mixed up
from time to time.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.528
You get any trouble from Rade or Whit,
you let me know.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.689
Coach here says
he's closing practice to outsiders.

18:37.867 --> 18:38.902
What you boys doing here?

18:39.076 --> 18:41.408
- Listen, I'll handle this.
- No, I got this.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.660
OK.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.412
Boys, this man's got a job to do.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.370
He wants you out of here. I best believe
you'd better be on your way.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.205
- Make two lines facing me.
- [men arguing, indistinct]

18:50.379 --> 18:51.835
Let's go, come on.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.874
Spread your legs, bend your knees,
put your butt down.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.501
Left hand up, right hand down.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.468
To your right. Let's go! To your left.
Let's go! Come on, move!

19:07.480 --> 19:08.641
Don't worry about George.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.272
He'll be right with you
when you start winning.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.228
Cletus! My friend, my good friend.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.521
A friend of years, friend of tears.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.985
You're looking fit and fiddle.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.900
Wilbert "Shooter" Flatch.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.577
This is Norman Dale, our new coach.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.988
- How are you?
- Coach.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.748
Clete, you tell him?

19:28.918 --> 19:32.001
Sectionals in '33. One point down.

19:32.463 --> 19:36.798
Five, four, three, two, one,
let her fly.

19:38.094 --> 19:41.507
In and out. Yeah. I was fouled.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.341
Now, Cletus,
if you had some small change,

19:46.519 --> 19:49.352
the missus and I have had
a parting of the ways of a sort.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.856
- Get you something to eat.
- My friend, my dear friend.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.230
Give it up.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.563
- It's only two bits.
- Give it up.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.318
- Sorry, Everett.
- It ain't your fault.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.783
This is my friend.
I mean, he's my friend of years.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.618
I don't wanna hear it, Dad.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.343
Jimmy, I didn't see you in class today.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.767
Any reason you want to tell me about?

20:43.117 --> 20:46.405
You know, in the ten years
that I coached...

20:48.122 --> 20:50.614
...I never met anybody
who wanted to win as badly as I did.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.543
I'd do anything I had to do
to increase my advantage.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.591
Anybody who tried to block the pursuit
of that advantage,

20:58.758 --> 21:01.841
I'd just push them out of the way.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.594
Didn't matter who they were
or what they were doing there.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.926
But that was then.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.062
Now, you have a special talent. A gift.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.893
Not the school's,
not the townspeople, not the team's.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.199
Not Myra Fleener's. Not mine.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.273
It's yours.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.700
To do with what you choose.

21:30.581 --> 21:34.199
Because that's what I believe,
I can tell you this.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.337
I don't care if you play
on the team or not.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.374
Mr. Dale, I wanna talk to you.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.248
Leave him alone, all right'?

22:16.877 --> 22:20.836
He's a real special kid
and I have high hopes for him and...

22:22.633 --> 22:24.169
...I think if he works really hard,

22:24.343 --> 22:26.801
he can get an academic scholarship
to Wabash College,

22:26.971 --> 22:28.678
and can get out of this place.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.680
Why, do you have something
against this place?

22:30.850 --> 22:33.842
[sighs] For him, yes, I do.
He could do better.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.888
You know, if Jimmy's as good
as everybody says he is,

22:38.065 --> 22:40.022
I would've thought
that a basketball scholarship

22:40.192 --> 22:41.978
would've made a lot of sense.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.768
[scoffs] Who'd ever see him play?

22:44.697 --> 22:47.189
The only thing that ever comes into
Hickory from the outside is the train,

22:47.366 --> 22:49.107
and it's here for about five minutes.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.743
[exhales]
Basketball scholarship.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.655
You know, a basketball hero
around here is treated like a god.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.450
How can he ever find out
what he can really do?

22:58.627 --> 23:01.460
I don't want this
to be the high point of his life.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.337
I've seen them. The real sad ones.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.714
They sit around the rest of their lives
talking about the glory days

23:05.885 --> 23:07.967
when they were 17 years old.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.253
You know, most people would kill

23:10.431 --> 23:12.889
to be treated like a god,
just for a few moments.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.141
Gods come pretty cheap
nowadays, don't they?

23:16.312 --> 23:19.475
I mean, you become one by putting
a leather ball in an iron hoop.

23:19.648 --> 23:22.310
And I hate to tell you this, Mr. Dale,
but it's only a game.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.475
Why so unfriendly, Ms. Fleener?

23:27.615 --> 23:29.322
I know men like you.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.072
You don't know anything about me.

23:33.704 --> 23:35.160
I know you're here.

23:36.707 --> 23:40.496
I know this place doesn't even appear
on most state maps.

23:42.463 --> 23:45.205
A man your age comes
to a place like this, he's either...

23:46.800 --> 23:49.542
He's running away from something
or he has nowhere else to go.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.428
What I'm doing here
has nothing to do with you.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.758
Just stay away from Jimmy.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.895
I don't want him coaching in Hickory
when he's 50.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.203
<i>[man over mic] Now, folks,
let's make him feel welcome.</i>

24:17.373 --> 24:19.660
<i>Our new coach, Norman Dale.</i>

24:19.833 --> 24:21.665
[applause]

24:26.423 --> 24:30.291
Uh, first of all,
I'd like to thank those of you

24:30.469 --> 24:32.710
who have made me
feel so welcome here.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.129
- [scattered applause]
- [Norman] Thank you.

24:36.892 --> 24:40.476
Uh, the boys and I are getting
to know each other...

24:40.646 --> 24:46.358
...uh, see who we are and...
what we can be.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.651
So far, I like what I've seen.

24:50.197 --> 24:54.612
I'm very excited
to be part of Indiana basketball.

24:54.785 --> 24:55.900
This is your team.

24:56.078 --> 24:59.366
[cheers, applause]

25:00.040 --> 25:02.122
- [marching band plays]
- [indistinct shouting]

25:21.645 --> 25:24.603
[indistinct shouts]

25:35.993 --> 25:38.485
[cheering fades]

25:38.662 --> 25:42.701
[crowd chanting] We want Jimmy!
We want Jimmy!

25:42.875 --> 25:46.618
We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!

25:47.046 --> 25:50.129
We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!

25:50.799 --> 25:54.463
We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!

25:54.636 --> 25:58.254
- We want Jimmy...
- [chanting stops]

25:59.808 --> 26:03.301
I would hope you would support
who we are, not who we are not.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.516
These six individuals

26:10.694 --> 26:12.651
have made a choice to work...

26:13.989 --> 26:16.026
...a choice to sacrifice...

26:17.409 --> 26:21.744
...to put themselves on the line
23 nights in the next four months...

26:24.166 --> 26:27.409
...to represent you, this high school.

26:29.338 --> 26:34.083
That kind of commitment and effort
deserves and demands your respect.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.096
This is your team.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.699
Coach, you all right'?

27:00.410 --> 27:01.866
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.035
All right, remember
to discipline your game.

27:08.168 --> 27:11.832
Absolutely no shots
until you've passed off four times.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.713
Set your offensive patterns
before you go to score.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.998
All right?

27:16.885 --> 27:18.387
- Is that clear'?
- Yes.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.174
- How many times are we gonna pass off'?
- [murmuring]

27:21.348 --> 27:23.510
<i>'</i> HOW many?
<i>'</i> [all] Four!

27:25.227 --> 27:26.513
Let us pray.

27:27.729 --> 27:30.141
"Be strong and of good courage

27:30.315 --> 27:34.855
for the Lord thy God is with thee
whithersoever thou goest."

27:35.028 --> 27:39.238
Lord, bless these boys
and the season before them.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.069
- Amen.
- [all] Amen.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.733
OK. Let's go.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.572
Let's beat these guys,
we can beat them.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.078
- Hold it up.
- Strap, come on.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.417
Strap?

27:54.548 --> 27:56.585
How long is he gonna go on like this?

27:56.758 --> 27:59.750
I don't know.
He'll come when he's ready, not before.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.838
I hope that'll be some time
before tip-off.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.131
OK, let's go.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.141
[boys shouting, cheering]

28:09.688 --> 28:11.053
How do you feel?

28:11.607 --> 28:12.972
Like it's my first game.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.938
Well, in a way, it is.
I'll be right there with you.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.450
[faint crowd cheering]

28:29.458 --> 28:31.620
Welcome to Indiana basketball.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.922
[crowd cheering, singing]

28:45.682 --> 28:48.674
- Hi. How are you?
- Good luck.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.803
[song, singing continues]

29:10.165 --> 29:12.156
Fight, fight, fight!

29:23.220 --> 29:24.210
Ollie, you get ready.

29:24.388 --> 29:27.005
You're gonna play until Strap gets here,
if he ever does.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.298
- I'll go get him.
- No, you... Come on, get back.

29:29.476 --> 29:33.344
OK, guys, a minimum of four passes
before you take a shot, all right'?

29:33.522 --> 29:35.604
Get yourselves set before you let go.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.936
Five pistons firing together. All right'?

29:38.110 --> 29:39.692
Come on. Here we go.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.852
Come on. Team. Come on.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.814
- Thank God.
- Team!

29:44.992 --> 29:47.404
[all] We got spirit, yes, we do.
We got spirit. How about you?

29:47.577 --> 29:50.490
We got spirit, yes, we do.
We got spirit. How about you?

29:50.664 --> 29:53.406
We got spirit, yes, we do.
We got spirit. How about you?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.010
- Four passes!
- Go, go!

30:09.308 --> 30:11.720
[Norman] Don't just stand there, move!

30:11.893 --> 30:13.395
Shoot the ball, Rade!

30:13.729 --> 30:15.345
Set some picks!

30:18.483 --> 30:20.065
What's wrong with you?

30:23.530 --> 30:25.237
- Work the good shot.
- [man] Come on!

30:28.410 --> 30:29.900
- Put the ball up!
- Just shoot, shoot it!

30:39.129 --> 30:41.712
[crowd chanting]
Pass it! Pass it!

30:42.132 --> 30:44.544
Pass it! Pass it!

30:45.385 --> 30:46.796
- [crowd cheers]
- Ah...

30:48.597 --> 30:50.213
Set up your defense!

30:51.892 --> 30:53.724
Call out. Switch it.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.394
Is that what you call coaching'?

31:01.568 --> 31:04.151
Four passes! Pass the ball in!

31:04.571 --> 31:06.778
Work it in for the good shot.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.447
Work the good shot.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.587
Strap, come on, move!

31:27.803 --> 31:29.965
Come on, defense!
Block it out! Block it out!

31:32.808 --> 31:36.517
- [cheers, boos]
- Oh no.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.100
Come on, set up the offense.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.890
Pass it off! Pass it off!

31:45.529 --> 31:47.111
Four passes!

31:48.865 --> 31:51.527
[cheering continues]

31:53.537 --> 31:55.244
[Norman] Work for the good shot!

31:55.414 --> 31:57.496
- Shoot the ball!
- Put the ball up!

31:59.418 --> 32:00.658
- Come on!
- Look what you've done!

32:00.836 --> 32:02.497
[boos]

32:13.598 --> 32:15.851
I want you to close down
those passing lanes!

32:16.017 --> 32:17.098
Your defense is awful!

32:17.269 --> 32:19.476
What about our offense?
We can't win unless we score.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.853
You keep your mouth shut
until I tell you to open it.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.014
What kind of wingnut stunt are you
trying to pull out there?

32:24.192 --> 32:24.818
Get out.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.350
For Christ's sake,
let's let them run and shoot!

32:26.528 --> 32:27.484
Get out of here.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.815
- Sam, Sam...
- It's embarrassing!

32:28.989 --> 32:30.070
Stay out.

32:33.577 --> 32:36.535
I don't want anybody
in this locker room at half-time.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.821
- Now keep them out of here.
- Norm...

32:39.624 --> 32:41.956
I'm trying hard to believe
that you know what you're doing.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.709
I know what I'm doing!

32:46.214 --> 32:47.955
You've got three fouls.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.962
You guys remember what we
worked on in practice, all right?

32:55.140 --> 32:57.051
I wanna see it on the court!

32:59.895 --> 33:01.556
How many times are we going
to pass before we shoot?

33:01.730 --> 33:02.686
<i>Four.</i>

33:02.856 --> 33:04.392
- How many?
- Four!

33:05.233 --> 33:06.394
Foufl

33:12.741 --> 33:14.448
Set it up. Set it up!

33:29.966 --> 33:33.084
Rade! Rade! Pass the ball!

33:41.770 --> 33:43.386
Ollie, go in for Rade.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.392
Now! Move! Come on.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.861
[buzzer sounds]

33:58.787 --> 33:59.948
Good job, Rade.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.590
- [blows whistle] Foul on number 12.
- Ah, come on!

34:20.766 --> 34:22.757
[buzzer sounds]

34:24.563 --> 34:25.724
That's five.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.235
- 25.
- Where you going?

34:34.614 --> 34:37.322
- In the game.
- Sit down.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.821
What do you mean?
We gotta have five out there.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.318
Sit down!

34:42.205 --> 34:43.195
Sit!

34:51.339 --> 34:52.670
Coach, you need one more.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.670
My team's on the floor.

34:55.844 --> 34:56.925
OK.

34:57.971 --> 34:59.507
What are you trying to do?

34:59.681 --> 35:01.763
- He's only got four guys.
- [crowd exclaims]

35:04.686 --> 35:07.053
[indistinct chatter, boos]

35:55.487 --> 35:58.730
Those of you on the floor at the end,
I'm proud of you.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.696
You played your guts out.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.205
I'm only gonna say this one time.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.795
All of you have the weekend.

36:24.641 --> 36:28.009
Think about whether or not
you want to be on this team or not.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.514
Under the following condition.

36:34.651 --> 36:35.937
What I say...

36:37.028 --> 36:39.611
...when it comes to this basketball team
is the law.

36:39.781 --> 36:42.523
Absolutely and without discussion!

36:57.340 --> 36:59.957
Come on, guys.
Let's listen to what he says.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.466
Shut up.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.297
No, you shut up, Rade.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.721
Coach, how about a haircut?

37:13.898 --> 37:15.980
- Who cuts your hair?
- Yours truly.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.937
[chuckling] No.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.193
Coach, you gonna
play with three next time?

37:20.363 --> 37:21.774
Those aren't bad odds,
five against three.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.861
- Let me help you there.
- Oh. Appreciate it.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.650
- Opal Fleener.
- How are you?

37:26.828 --> 37:29.866
- Been hearing plenty on you.
- Mother likes basketball.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.292
Yeah, that's the truth and then some.

37:32.459 --> 37:33.870
- Here.
- No, no, it's all right. I can do it.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.910
Thank you. Mother, it's getting late.
We better get going. Come on.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.671
The sun don't shine
on the same dog's ass every day,

37:39.841 --> 37:43.755
but, mister, you ain't seen
a ray of light since you got here.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.794
I believe it's time we had a talk.

37:46.389 --> 37:47.845
Sunday.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.673
<i>Supper.</i>

37:51.311 --> 37:53.018
I accept.

38:27.764 --> 38:29.755
Coach, tell me about the boys.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.341
You think you can bring them around?

38:32.519 --> 38:36.387
There's a lot of talent there,
it's just raw and undisciplined.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.851
So what are you gonna do about that?

38:40.985 --> 38:43.363
I'm gonna break them down
and then I'm gonna build them back up.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.071
- This fire needs more wood.
- I'll get it.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.653
No, you won't.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.504
Basketball.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.672
Every game my brother ever played

39:11.850 --> 39:15.013
was the most important thing
ever happened to this family.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.769
Mother wouldn't be able
to sleep the night before.

39:17.939 --> 39:21.648
And if they lost,
Daddy'd walk the floor until morning.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.602
I just could never figure out why
it meant so much, not to that extreme.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.066
I don't get it.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.449
What are you doing here,
living in Hickory?

39:32.245 --> 39:33.781
I haven't always been here.

39:33.955 --> 39:36.993
I went to college three years,
graduate school a year.

39:37.166 --> 39:40.534
- Graduate school?
- Surprised?

39:40.879 --> 39:42.461
You sound like my father.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.964
He thought it strange I ever wanted to
leave town. Kept telling me I'd be back.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.796
Of course he was right.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.469
Why'd you come back'?

39:53.474 --> 39:54.976
Didn't work out.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.635
Daddy died. Mother got sick.
I had to come back.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.305
You never plan on leaving'?

40:03.860 --> 40:05.476
Did you ever consider getting married?

40:05.653 --> 40:08.395
Come on, you must've had
a lot of opportunities.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.483
You know, during all those years away,

40:13.661 --> 40:16.153
there were a few things
I missed not being here.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.910
I missed knowing that nothing
ever changes. People never change.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.995
It makes you feel real solid.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.333
I also missed knowing
that people's private affairs

40:25.506 --> 40:27.247
stay pretty much their own.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.676
OK. I'm sorry.

40:46.361 --> 40:47.647
Hey Coach.

40:51.532 --> 40:53.660
Isn't it a little late
to be calling on folks'?

40:54.661 --> 40:57.119
I wouldn't trust old Rooster, neither.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.790
It's a nice place you got here.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.209
Ah, it's a nice night for a fire.

41:16.683 --> 41:19.971
- That's a hell of a team you had there.
- You knew that team?

41:20.144 --> 41:23.136
I know everything there is to know
about the greatest game ever invented!

41:24.565 --> 41:27.432
- Did you know about...
- No, that don't matter.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.310
A man's got to do what he's got to do.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.650
You're playing Cedar Knob tomorrow.

41:33.366 --> 41:35.733
Ain't nobody knows them better than me.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.953
I been watching,
how you been breaking the colts.

41:41.165 --> 41:45.580
But, my friend, you cannot play them
all the way man-on-man.

41:45.753 --> 41:50.293
They got no head toppers.
Cedar Knob, a bunch of mites.

41:50.466 --> 41:51.843
Run you off the boards.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.256
You got to squeeze them
back in the paint.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.513
Make them chuck it
from the cheap seats.

41:58.683 --> 42:01.266
Watch that purgatory they call a gym.

42:01.769 --> 42:04.306
No drive, 12 foot in.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.769
That'll do. [chuckles]

42:17.326 --> 42:19.784
[Shooter whistling]

42:19.954 --> 42:21.786
[laughing]

42:28.963 --> 42:31.876
[music playing low]

42:32.050 --> 42:33.711
How'd your father get this job'?

42:33.885 --> 42:35.922
- It's our bus.
- Oh.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.961
It doesn't look like a preacher's bus.

42:38.514 --> 42:42.223
Well, after sectional's over, we paint
it white for the summer tent shows.

42:43.144 --> 42:47.103
But every fall, back to red.
After his revelation.

42:49.150 --> 42:50.606
God told him.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.648
To paint the bus and drive the team?

42:57.909 --> 42:59.070
[chuckles]

43:03.331 --> 43:05.117
[grunting]

43:06.959 --> 43:08.996
- These guys are like animals.
- Coach!

43:09.170 --> 43:10.752
How can anybody play
in this cracker box?

43:10.922 --> 43:13.459
Coach, their boy Nelson,
he can't go to his left.

43:13.633 --> 43:14.794
I know that.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.459
- Time out!
- [screams]

43:19.806 --> 43:21.171
Time out.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.766
- Come on! Leave me alone!
- [crowd cheering]

43:28.940 --> 43:30.021
OK, guys, listen up.

43:30.191 --> 43:33.354
I think we can run on these guys.
The two guards are never getting back.

43:35.530 --> 43:39.023
- Sorry. I can't help my mouth.
- You be sorry on the bench.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.483
Strap, go in for Rade.

43:42.662 --> 43:44.198
Buddy, get the ball
between their guards.

43:44.372 --> 43:46.613
Watch for Everett and Merle
cutting to the basket. All right'?

43:46.791 --> 43:49.032
- [buzzer]
- OK, let's go.

43:49.877 --> 43:51.129
Team!

43:51.295 --> 43:53.548
- [indistinct shouts]
- [whistle blows]

44:06.060 --> 44:08.768
- [whistle blows]
- That's a flagrant foul!

44:08.938 --> 44:10.520
That player should be
taken out of the game!

44:10.690 --> 44:13.398
- He didn't do nothing wrong.
- Come on, that's hillbilly justice!

44:13.568 --> 44:15.150
You ain't been around
these parts too long, have you?

44:15.319 --> 44:18.107
I've been around long enough
to recognize a hometown referee.

44:18.281 --> 44:20.397
[boos]

44:24.287 --> 44:25.652
Technical foul.

44:25.830 --> 44:29.573
Look, it's bad enough we got to play
in this cage you call a gym.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.832
Your players are playing
like a bunch of gorillas!

44:32.003 --> 44:33.414
Who are you calling a gorilla?

44:33.588 --> 44:34.794
You, for one!

44:35.673 --> 44:36.959
Bust off.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.500
- [cheering]
- [chatter]

44:40.678 --> 44:42.419
Move back.
You wanna stay in this game, son,

44:42.597 --> 44:45.385
you just go back to the bench.
Come on. Move back!

44:45.558 --> 44:47.299
I said, move back!

44:47.476 --> 44:48.978
Come on, break it up!

44:49.145 --> 44:50.431
I don't wanna see you again.

44:50.605 --> 44:52.437
Not this game. You're out.

44:52.607 --> 44:54.473
You're gone. Both of you. Out!

44:55.902 --> 44:58.519
- Come on, boys. Let's go.
- Sit down!

44:58.696 --> 45:00.528
All right, now, calm down.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.656
- You all right'?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

45:03.826 --> 45:05.658
You better get outta here.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.444
I'll do the best I can.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.626
Good riddance, you jackass!

45:15.796 --> 45:19.005
- Got him a good one, didn't I, coach?
- Yeah, you did.

45:45.326 --> 45:47.533
- How's...
- Just a little while, OK?

45:51.999 --> 45:53.330
How you feeling?

45:54.710 --> 45:56.087
Just tired.

45:57.922 --> 46:00.163
Someone said
my pump's going bad on me.

46:02.969 --> 46:04.505
Why didn't you tell me'?

46:05.972 --> 46:07.804
It's a little late for that.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.932
I guess the doctor says
you got to take it easy.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.393
No more basketball games
for a while, huh?

46:17.566 --> 46:18.647
Yeah.

46:19.527 --> 46:21.768
Looks like you're on your own.

46:22.446 --> 46:23.857
That's fine.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.485
You kind of like being on your own.

46:28.452 --> 46:30.989
I'd kind of like to see you
up on your feet.

46:31.664 --> 46:33.450
You can count on it.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.892
[honking]

47:02.069 --> 47:03.355
[Norman] Anybody home?

47:05.740 --> 47:07.230
[barking]

47:10.870 --> 47:13.032
- [gunshot]
- [Shooter] Identify!

47:14.373 --> 47:15.408
It's Norm.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.290
- [Shooter] Coach?
- Yeah.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.371
What you doing out here?

47:19.545 --> 47:21.377
What happened to my scout?

47:22.423 --> 47:24.209
We're playing Verdi tonight.

47:24.383 --> 47:26.090
Verdi, huh?

47:26.677 --> 47:28.054
Well, We'll talk.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.425
This is my domicile here.

47:32.433 --> 47:35.767
Sit yourself down over there
by the fire and warm up.

47:38.272 --> 47:40.434
- [sighs] This is it, huh?
- Yeah.

47:40.816 --> 47:42.727
It gets pretty rough here in the winter,
but I manage.

47:42.902 --> 47:43.858
[chuckling] I'll bet.

47:44.028 --> 47:46.520
- Want a little snort?
- No. Thanks. No.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.439
- Don't mind if I do.
- I got a proposition for you.

47:49.992 --> 47:52.154
Cletus is going to be
laid up for a while.

47:52.328 --> 47:55.411
And I want you to give me a hand.

47:55.581 --> 47:58.949
I can tell you anything
that you need to know.

47:59.710 --> 48:03.453
No, you don't understand.
I want you to be my assistant.

48:03.798 --> 48:05.459
I want you to come to practices

48:05.633 --> 48:07.874
and sit on the bench
with me during the games.

48:10.304 --> 48:13.046
- [chuckling]
- Me'? You want me'?

48:13.474 --> 48:16.637
Yeah. What do you say'?
Under the following conditions.

48:16.811 --> 48:18.552
That you, uh...

48:18.729 --> 48:20.185
Uh...

48:20.356 --> 48:21.767
...clean yourself up.

48:21.941 --> 48:23.227
And, um...

48:25.611 --> 48:27.477
<i>“you shave, and, uh...</i>

48:30.783 --> 48:33.366
...y0u show up at the games on time
and the practices,

48:33.536 --> 48:37.575
- and you wear a shirt and tie.
- I got myself a suit right there.

48:37.748 --> 48:40.490
I got a wing-dinger.
I was married in that suit, there.

48:41.585 --> 48:43.167
And that you're sober.

48:45.756 --> 48:46.917
Oh, no.

48:48.634 --> 48:49.999
My wife sent you.

48:50.469 --> 48:53.006
- No.
- My son.

48:54.181 --> 48:55.558
What does my...

48:56.517 --> 48:58.849
...drinking got to do with my knowledge
about basketball?

48:59.019 --> 49:01.181
You can't drink in front of these boys.

49:01.730 --> 49:03.016
If I, uh...

49:03.941 --> 49:07.354
...smell even a trace of liquor
on your breath, you'll be finished.

49:08.696 --> 49:10.858
I don't have to hear that from you.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.616
You're embarrassing your son.

49:22.668 --> 49:24.909
I don't need to hear that.
I'd... I'd...

49:25.713 --> 49:27.329
I'd like you to leave.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.216
I'd like you to leave now.

49:51.155 --> 49:54.273
- [crowd cheering, chanting]
- [indistinct chatter]

49:56.994 --> 49:58.496
[boy] Time out, ref.

49:58.662 --> 50:00.323
[blows whistle]

50:05.127 --> 50:08.165
- [boy] Nice shot, Rade.
- [chatter]

50:08.339 --> 50:11.047
Guys, you're playing real well.
Real well.

50:11.217 --> 50:12.833
Put more pressure on the ball.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.385
Be real patient on your offense. What...

50:16.555 --> 50:18.762
[girls cheering, chanting]

50:22.686 --> 50:24.427
What's he doing here?

50:29.735 --> 50:31.897
Shooter here is gonna
be one of our assistants.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.152
You got it'?

50:37.076 --> 50:38.658
[buzzer]

50:39.537 --> 50:41.198
You got anything you want to...

50:42.081 --> 50:43.867
Coach, you thinking
about playing ball or not?

50:44.041 --> 50:46.032
- Yeah, we'll be there.
- Let's go.

50:46.210 --> 50:47.951
- OK, come on.
- Let's go.

50:48.462 --> 50:49.827
Team!

50:56.637 --> 50:58.503
Come on, play ball. Play ball!

51:01.475 --> 51:04.467
- I ain't feeling real good.
- You'll be fine.

51:06.146 --> 51:09.229
The kids are starting to get it.
I mean, it's really fun!

51:15.948 --> 51:17.313
[Ollie] Progress.

51:17.491 --> 51:19.482
Progress is electricity,

51:19.660 --> 51:22.493
school consolidation, church remodeling,

51:22.663 --> 51:25.701
second farm tractors, second farm cars,

51:25.874 --> 51:28.161
- hay balers...
- [bell rings]

51:28.335 --> 51:30.827
...corn pickers, grain combines,

51:31.005 --> 51:34.714
- field choppers and indoor plumbing.
- [students laugh]

51:34.883 --> 51:36.009
All right, you're dismissed.

51:36.176 --> 51:37.883
[chatter]

51:59.325 --> 52:00.486
What's on your mind?

52:02.870 --> 52:04.031
Well...

52:05.205 --> 52:07.162
...coach, what you're doing
with my dad...

52:10.836 --> 52:12.201
I'm not seeing it.

52:14.715 --> 52:15.876
Why not?

52:16.717 --> 52:19.880
'Cause he's a drunk.
He'll do something stupid.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.383
When's the last time
somebody gave him a chance?

52:27.227 --> 52:28.968
He don't deserve a chance.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.351
Go on.

52:37.655 --> 52:38.895
How are you?

52:41.617 --> 52:43.858
I've been asked as acting principal

52:44.036 --> 52:46.949
to inform you
that a petition's been issued...

52:47.790 --> 52:51.249
...requesting a referendum
on your removal as basketball coach.

52:55.923 --> 52:58.711
The vote'll be made
at a town meeting on Saturday.

53:03.180 --> 53:07.014
I guess that gives me until Friday
night's game to prove myself, huh?

53:07.851 --> 53:10.889
I think it goes a lot deeper
than one game, don't you?

53:27.371 --> 53:29.487
[crowd cheering, chanting]

53:37.631 --> 53:39.622
Call time out. Time out!

53:41.969 --> 53:43.334
- Time out, ref.
- [blows whistle]

53:43.512 --> 53:44.422
Technical foul.

53:44.596 --> 53:46.257
On the playing floor
while the game is in progress.

53:46.432 --> 53:49.015
What're you talking about? The ball was
dead. I'm trying to call a time out.

53:49.184 --> 53:50.174
- That's it. You're gone.
- What do you mean?

53:50.352 --> 53:52.593
Out of the game. I'm putting you
on file with the state commission.

53:52.771 --> 53:54.478
[Norman] What'? Are you crazy?

53:54.648 --> 53:56.013
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving here!

53:56.191 --> 53:57.226
<i>Yank
gww</i>

53:58.485 --> 54:00.476
[indistinct whisper]

54:03.407 --> 54:04.989
That ain't fair.

54:05.159 --> 54:07.617
It ain't fair what the people in this
town are trying to do to you neither.

54:07.786 --> 54:10.073
You stay in the game. I need your help.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.487
Stay in the game.

54:11.665 --> 54:13.201
Come on, boys.

54:15.627 --> 54:19.086
Shooter's gonna take you home.
You pay attention.

54:30.184 --> 54:32.551
[chanting, cheering continues]

54:44.198 --> 54:46.860
[cheering slowly fades]

54:56.376 --> 54:58.583
[crowd exclaims, boos]

55:16.730 --> 55:18.721
Hi. Sorry.

55:21.151 --> 55:23.893
It's me. Cletus told me
where I could find you.

55:27.449 --> 55:29.440
I used to play in these fields.

55:31.078 --> 55:33.285
I used to wonder
what it would feel like to start walking

55:33.455 --> 55:34.991
and just keep going.

55:35.165 --> 55:37.156
Mm, that's tempting.

55:37.876 --> 55:40.743
Aren't you the kind who'd rather look
for a fight than run away from one?

55:40.921 --> 55:42.082
What'?

55:49.680 --> 55:52.422
"Norman Dale, coach of the
National Champions, Ithaca Warriors

55:52.599 --> 55:56.137
was given a lifetime suspension,
to be honored by all NCAA signatories

55:56.311 --> 56:00.771
for physically assaulting his own
player in lthaca's last season's game.

56:00.941 --> 56:03.399
This was the latest
in a series of controversial incidents

56:03.569 --> 56:06.357
involving the successful,
though highly volatile coach.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.771
The New York High School
Athletic Association has stated

56:08.949 --> 56:11.236
they will honor the suspension as well."

56:13.287 --> 56:16.905
- Where'd you find that article?
- The library in Deerlick.

56:17.499 --> 56:18.660
Hm...

56:21.670 --> 56:23.035
I was curious.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.127
I want to tell you
that I think your efforts

56:31.305 --> 56:33.546
in regards to Shooter have been noble.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.510
They have. They've been fine.

56:36.852 --> 56:39.719
And I appreciate you staying away
from Jimmy the way you have.

56:43.317 --> 56:45.854
I don't think you'd
better be there tonight.

56:48.155 --> 56:49.645
It won't be pleasant.

56:59.708 --> 57:00.948
I've made some mistakes,

57:01.126 --> 57:03.834
but they're mistakes
I take full responsibility for.

57:08.342 --> 57:10.583
I was hired to teach the boys
the game of basketball

57:10.761 --> 57:12.752
and I did that
to the best of my ability.

57:16.725 --> 57:18.432
I apologize for nothing.

57:24.024 --> 57:26.857
You may not be pleased
with the results, but I am.

57:30.822 --> 57:32.688
I'm very proud of these boys.

57:42.125 --> 57:43.536
I, um...

57:55.889 --> 57:57.800
[low chatter]

58:07.901 --> 58:11.565
I think, in order to be fair...

58:24.042 --> 58:27.251
I think it'd be a big mistake
to let Coach Dale go.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.251
Give him a chance.

58:36.930 --> 58:38.762
[indistinct chatter]

58:46.773 --> 58:48.059
[George] Ah, look, uh...

58:48.233 --> 58:50.600
Sam and Rollin, here,
will pass out the ballots.

58:50.777 --> 58:53.519
A yes vote means he stays.
A no vote, he goes.

58:53.697 --> 58:55.813
Let's do this as quickly as we can.

59:03.540 --> 59:07.784
[basketball bouncing]

59:30.150 --> 59:33.563
- [chatter]
- Jimmy, what are you doing here?

59:40.160 --> 59:41.321
Jimmy.

59:48.668 --> 59:50.659
- What can I do for you, Jimmy?
- I got something to say.

59:52.923 --> 59:55.881
Then, son, you better say
what you gotta say.

59:56.885 --> 59:58.842
- [man] Shh, shh...
- [chatter stops]

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.307
I don't know if it'll make any change,

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.689
but I figure it's time
for me to start playing ball.

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:14.566
[cheers]

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.696
I told you once we got rid of him...

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:28.531
One other thing...
I play, coach stays.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.039
He goes, I go.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.042
[confused chatter]

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.597
Now, look, wait. He, uh...

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:49.226
Coach is dismissed
by a vote of 68 to 45.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:51.307
I think we should vote again.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.688
[crowd] Yeah!

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:56.726
- [Rollin] Call for a revote.
- [man 2] No, we don't need a vote.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:01:01.735
[Rollin] All those in favor
of the coach staying, say "aye."

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.070
Aye!

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:05.575
Those opposed'?

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.247
[scattered voices] Nay!

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:10.202
[tearing paper]
Coach stays.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.286
[cheers, applause]

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.256
[cheering]

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:34.330
[Norman] Get in there.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:39.166
Hey! You listen to me.
I stuck my neck out for you.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:41.213
You live up to your end of the bargain,

01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:43.340
or get yourself
in a hospital and dry out!

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.842
- I don't think I can cut it.
- You can cut it.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.878
I didn't think
I could cut it the other night either,

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.217
but after what Jimmy did,

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.974
it would take the Indiana National Guard
to get me outta here.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:54.475
- My old nerves are shot.
- Hey...

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:56.637
We're coming together as a team.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:03:01.275
With Jimmy, all the pistons are firing.
We got ten games to play.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.856
Right?
We're gonna be a tough team to beat.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.772
Now, you come along for the ride. OK?

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:10.280
But... You got to give me your word

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:13.991
that you will not
be kicked out of no games.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:19.035
- Scout's honor. [chuckling]
- Scout's honor!

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:54.156
[blows whistle]

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:55.825
[crowd cheering]

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:03.086
That's a foul on number 21
of the red team...

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:05.293
I just wanna discuss this
with him, all right?

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:06.832
Just take it easy.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.751
You got pigeon shit in your eyes?

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.430
Now, relax. I didn't have
the best angle...

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:13.589
You're pathetic, you know that!
You're a disgrace to your profession!

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.257
- Relax.
- Kick me out of the game.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:17.267
- You're putting me on.
- No, kick me out of the game

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.599
or I'll start screaming like a mad fool.

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.639
I guess you've got your reasons.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.272
- You're out of here!
- What'?

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:26.151
- [crowd clamors]
- Come on!

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:29.063
Come on!
That's... That's ridiculous!

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.199
I've done it again.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.786
It's up to you now.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.513
I told him not to.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.315
Time out!

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.855
[whistle blows]

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.444
[man] Time out.

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:15.442
Go! Come on!

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.119
Let's go! Come on!

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:31.504
You reckon number four
will put up their last shot, Dad?

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.343
Yeah, probably.

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:36.589
They've been picking low all night.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:38.681
Yeah.

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:40.853
Uh...

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:43.975
Rade,

01:05:44.149 --> 01:05:46.390
let yourself get taken out.

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:51.028
Buddy, you drop down and take his place.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.105
Close that lane.

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:55.657
All right.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.951
- OK, team!
- Team!

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.454
- Come on.
- [whistle blows]

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.802
- Time! Time!
- Time out, ref.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.431
[whistle blows]

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:22.388
[man] Time out, red team.

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:24.932
Come on in, come on in.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:27.806
All right, now listen to me.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.601
This is the last shot that we got.
All right?

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.482
We're gonna run
the picket fence at them.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:37.069
Merle, you're the swing man.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.359
Jimmy, you're solo right.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:43.781
All right, Merle should be open,
swinging around the end of that fence.

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:47.667
Now, boys, don't get caught
watching the paint dry.

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:50.419
- All right.
- Team!

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.716
[whistle blows]

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:22.118
- Yeah! We did it!
- [crowd cheering]

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:25.910
Hey boys, we did it. We did it!

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:35.166
[excited chatter]

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:39.799
You did good, Pop.

01:07:40.765 --> 01:07:42.176
You did real good.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:45.468
- You did it, Shooter!
- Coach, good job.

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:47.306
[hooting, chattering]

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:23.133
[cheering, chanting continues]

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:40.192
Where's your father?

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.198
Said he wanted to be alone, sir.
Too much pressure.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:46.365
Hey, you keep in the game. All right'?

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:47.529
- Yes, sir.
- Mentally.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.197
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:53.577
[crowd chanting] We want a basket now!
We want a basket, right now!

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:58.712
We want a basket now!
We want a basket, right now!

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:02.840
Hey, ref! Call it both ways!

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.379
Come on!

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:07.219
[crowd] We want a basket now!

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.555
We want a basket, right now!

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:12.095
He's got his hands all over him!

01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:24.240
I've got 12, red. One-two, red.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.572
Come on! What're you talking about?

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.408
[Shooter] Ref! Ref! Ho! Whoa!

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:30.743
[Shooter continues shouting]

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.407
Ref! That was no foul!

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:35.497
No, you were out of position
to make the call.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.754
- That was charging all the way.
- Get him outta here.

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.085
His feet were planted.

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:41.750
Yes! Charging all the way!

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:43.794
Norm, his feet were planted.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.506
We know that. We know that. Come on.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:46.968
Get my...

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.929
Get that bozo there glasses!

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:51.434
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.437
[man] Hey, Shooter,
ain't you a little old to be playing?

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.315
It's OK. He's an assistant coach.
It's fine.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:01.604
[blows whistle]
That's a technical foul...

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:04.068
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute!

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:06.108
He just wandered out on the floor.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:08.868
Don't tell me that! Oh Jesus!

01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:13.243
You keep in the game, Everett.
You understand?

01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:15.040
Come on, play hard!

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.961
[grunting]

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:37.685
[grunting]

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.582
[grunting, chatter]

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:02.884
[gm] Guys, stop it!

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:04.719
[man] Break it up!

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:12.640
[screa ms, chatter]

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:15.347
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:24.148
- Look at that.
- Oh mercy. Let's get him on his feet.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.653
- [man] Come on. Is he all right'?
- Come on, boy.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.234
Come on, now. Forfeit that team.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:29.024
My boy can't even play.
He's all racked up.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:31.443
Ifyoulose,
then we'll protest, all right'?

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:32.702
- I'll file a protest.
- Everybody back!

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.112
That's a gutless way to win.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.327
I'm gonna file a protest.
Get outta my face!

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:38.287
[man] Get back. Let's play ball!

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.064
[grunting]

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:26.248
Get the ball! Get the ball!

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.295
Get the ball!

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:34.723
- [crowd] Three, two, one!
- [cheering]

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:00.293
[Everett] Dad!

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:05.329
[Norman] Shooter!

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:12.043
Shooter!

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:16.302
Dad!

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:20.935
Dad.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:23.472
[panting]

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:52.299
[Shooter] Hi, coach.

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:57.764
A couple months in here
and you'll be dry as the Sahara desert.

01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:01.346
[Shooter]
It's goblin-visiting time, man.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.852
Oh, come on.
We're gonna be here for you.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:06.560
Yeah, you and the little green monkeys.

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:10.356
Oh, God. How's my son doing?

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:13.692
He's fine. He had eight stitches,
but, boy, he played his heart out.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:16.324
He was just... [chuckles]

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:19.612
Doc said he's gonna be OK
for the regionals in about a week.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.405
- He's a good boy.
- Yeah.

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:23.368
I'm so proud of you, coach.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.746
I am. [panting]

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.127
Sectional champs.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.881
I know what that means
to these folks around here.

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:33.917
A lot. I...

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:37.128
I remember what it meant to me.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.967
You're a big part of it.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:41.007
No.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:45.061
Coach, I'm freezing.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:47.021
Yeah, OK, I'll get...

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:49.307
Could we have a blanket, please?

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:54.236
Aw, damn. You know I didn't mean...

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:56.739
I didn't make a lick of difference.
You know that.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:03.196
You got yourself
a shiftless, no-account drunk.

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:05.615
[shivering]

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:08.034
Oh, God. [whimpers]

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:10.579
I'm so sorry.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:13.714
Basketball meant so much to me, coach.

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:15.261
I'm so proud of you.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:18.011
- I'm so sorry I let you down.
- Come on, Shooter.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.841
Nothing could be further from the truth.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.179
[whimpering grunts]

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:27.562
Nurse, I'm so thirsty. [gulps]

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:30.099
I'm so sorry, coach.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.102
[overlapping chatter]

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.691
Now you're gonna protect us.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.401
There's not enough apologizing for this.

01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:39.157
Just get the team in the gym, will you?

01:15:39.326 --> 01:15:41.033
Never seen nothing like this.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.489
I wish they'd wait till after the game.

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:44.495
Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go.
Come on, guys.

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:46.872
Does the team feel they can make it
to the State Championship finals?

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:48.033
Yeah, they do.

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.621
Come on, let's go, guys. Let's go.

01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:52.503
Let us through.

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:15.186
There's a, um...
tradition in tournament play

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:16.818
to not talk about the next step

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:18.980
until you've climbed
the one in front of you.

01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:23.990
I'm sure going to the state finals
is beyond your wildest dreams,

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:26.245
so let's just keep it right there.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.499
Forget about the crowds,

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:32.831
the size of the school,

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:34.507
their fancy uniforms.

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.835
And remember what got you here.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:41.503
Focus on the fundamentals that
we've gone over time and time again.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.842
And most important,
don't get caught up thinking

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.428
about winning or losing this game.

01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.886
If you put your effort and concentration
into playing to your potential,

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:51.520
to be the best that you can be,

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.398
I don't care what the scoreboard says,
at the end of the game,

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:56.354
in my book we're gonna be winners.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.271
OK?

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:10.911
All right! Let's go!

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:13.702
Let's go! Let me hear it!

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:14.960
[clapping intensifies]

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.668
- [boys] Go! so! so! so!
- Go! Go!

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:19.833
[cheering]

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.774
Ref, he's moving his pivot foot.

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:38.730
He's moving his pivot foot!

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:48.532
Block him out! Block him out!

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.909
Block 41 off the baseline!

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:58.663
[crowd cheers]

01:17:58.841 --> 01:17:59.956
OK!

01:18:02.052 --> 01:18:04.214
- [blows whistle]
- Come on!

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:06.129
[overlapping chatter]

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.199
Everett, you've gotta stop
that pass to the low post, all right'?

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.486
Rade, you come off
your man and give us some help inside.

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:32.621
Buddy, 41 is killing us.
He's just killing us, all right'?

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:35.044
Stick with him. I mean,
if you think of chewing gum.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:37.999
By the end of the game, I wanna know
what flavor he is. All right?

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.998
- [cheering]
- Nice shot! Nice shot!

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:21.337
- [blows whistle]
- [man over PA, indistinct]

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:28.048
Block him off!
Block him off the baseline!

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:31.464
[whistle blows]

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:34.100
[man] Foul on number 25, Butcher.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.182
That's Butcher's fifth personal foul.

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:40.390
[Norman] He was there first!

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:44.189
Come on!

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.532
- [shouts in pain]
- [whistle blows]

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:52.868
[crowd booing]

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:00.663
The stitches are pulled.

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:01.953
Patch him up. Come on, patch him up.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:03.087
I can't do it.

01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:05.794
Patch him up!
What, are you out of your mind?

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:08.209
- Hey. You keep blocking out, all right'?
- Yes, sir.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:09.673
- We're gonna win this game.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.463
All right.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.347
[crowd cheers]

01:20:24.903 --> 01:20:26.485
- Call time out. Time out.
- [whistle blows]

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.191
[man] Time out, white!

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:34.739
- Everett, you're on the bench.
- No, I wanna play.

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:36.449
Come on, you're on the bench.

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:39.577
Strap, you're gonna play for Everett.

01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:41.868
Don't shoot the ball
unless you're under the basket

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.458
all by yourself, understand? OK.

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:47.123
We've got two minutes
and 15 seconds, all right'?

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:50.794
Be patient. Work for the good shot.
You got it'?

01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:51.927
[buzzer]

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:53.303
[boy] Come on, let's go.
Let's beat this team.

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:54.555
[all] Team!

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.967
Let's go, guys. Come on.

01:20:57.144 --> 01:20:58.885
Let's go, Strap. Let's go.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:06.355
Strap, God wants you on the floor.

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:34.671
Yeah, that was a nice shot!

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:36.464
[man] Time out, white.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:40.180
[man over PA] Time out, Hickory.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:43.267
- What's gotten into you?
- The Lord. I can feel his strength.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.977
Keep your strength
in the dribble, all right'?

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:52.314
- [whistle blows]
- On me'?

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:55.734
No! Oh my...

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.699
- Foul on number 14, white.
- Are you joking?

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:02.832
- Come on, give us a break!
- [man over PA] That's number 14...

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:05.580
That's his fifth personal foul.

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:07.328
Good game.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.796
Ollie, we need you.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:19.594
Ollie, we need you now.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:24.682
Go!

01:22:35.325 --> 01:22:36.702
He was Dentyne.

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:41.658
[man over PA] Substitution for Hickory,
number 13...

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:49.662
[shouting]

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:53.124
[whistle blows]

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:59.509
[cheering muffled]

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.073
Let's go!

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:30.878
Foul him! Foul him!

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:32.129
[blows whistle]

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:35.750
Orange, one-zero,
with a push. One shot.

01:23:35.928 --> 01:23:36.884
You can do it.

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:39.170
Come on! Let's go!

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.430
Let's go. You can do it.

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:43.678
Come on, let's go, Big Ollie.

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:51.432
[wild cheers, boos]

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:19.418
- [camera shutters clicking]
- [grunting]

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:23.138
- [crowd exclaims]
- [whistle blows]

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:27.726
[man] I got number ten, orange.
Two shots.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:39.109
- Time out, ref. Time out.
- [blows whistle]

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:40.990
That's time out, orange.

01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:46.324
Let's g0, GUYS-

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.535
All right, listen.

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:50.825
After Ollie makes his second shot...

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:54.499
...and you will make your second shot...

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.172
...get back on defense right away.

01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:00.551
There may just be enough time for them
to throw in a desperation toss, OK?

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:02.883
- [buzzer]
- All right, let's go.

01:25:03.056 --> 01:25:04.171
[boy] Put 'em in, Ollie.

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:06.473
Team!

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:11.304
Make it a good one, Strap.

01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:24.533
Didn't know they grew 'em
so small down on the farm.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:29.989
Don't worry about that, OK?

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:32.249
You just concentrate on what you're
doing and put them in the hole.

01:25:32.419 --> 01:25:33.909
All right? You can do it. Let's go.

01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:37.546
<i>_</i> [song ends]
- [cheering]

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:39.047
Two shots.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.072
One more, Ollie. One more
and we're going all the way, all right'?

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:06.404
- Concentrate.
- Ollie!

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:09.491
Just one more! Just one more!

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:18.871
[indistinct, muffled]

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:36.813
Get them now! Get them now!

01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:39.941
- [crowd] ...two, one!
- [wild cheering]

01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:54.198
Yeah!

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:02.335
[grunting]

01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:11.385
You always garden in the mud'?

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:16.854
The almanac says
it's time to start planting.

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:26.693
Is the almanac always right'?

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:30.151
- [panting] Always.
- [chuckles]

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:32.490
The farmer's daughter.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:36.282
- Miller's.
- Miller's daughter.

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:44.586
- Your mother cut my hair.
- [laughs]

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.501
Yeah. I saw your car.

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:52.723
Like to take a walk?

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:06.107
- That's pretty.
- [panting]

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.442
Yeah.

01:28:07.783 --> 01:28:10.195
In late spring, those fields,

01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:12.234
they're so green it looks like Ireland.

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:13.914
- Huh.
- [chuckles]

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.617
Or how I always imagined
Ireland would look.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.367
I've seen it in pictures and postcards.

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:25.373
Would you like to go to Deerlick
some evening, take in a movie?

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:34.390
Norman Dale, coach
of the Ithaca Warriors

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:38.348
- was suspended for...
- I can't really explain that.

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:43.519
It's been a number of years,

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:46.481
and it still kind of
goes around in my head. I...

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:51.315
I slow it down,
sometimes I really think that I can

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:54.281
stop my fist
from hitting that boy's jaw.

01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:58.414
In one second, everything
I'd worked for was just all finished.

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:03.665
Funny thing, too, he was the best kid
that ever played for me.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:06.580
Tough, stubborn, willful. He...

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.797
Sounds like someone I know.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:33.782
I imagined kissing you
ever since I first saw you.

01:29:34.995 --> 01:29:37.362
I was just tired of imagining it.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:39.955
It's been a long time.

01:29:41.334 --> 01:29:42.745
For me, too.

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:55.880
- [overlapping chatter]
- All right, let's go. Let's go.

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:58.173
Coach, how did you do it'?

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:00.426
It wasn't me, it was the boys.

01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:03.687
- ...miss that final shot'?
- No, I knew I had it all the way.

01:30:03.857 --> 01:30:04.813
Really?

01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:06.974
- Coach, up here!
- Uh, I'll tell you about it later.

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:08.517
Team you're matched
against in the finals,

01:30:08.695 --> 01:30:11.312
South Bend Central,
is one of the power teams in the state.

01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:14.356
Their front line is 6'4", 6'5" and 6'5".

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:17.196
- How can your little guys compete?
- I don't know.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.486
- [laughter]
- Do you have a scouting report?

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:21.530
Well, more important to me
than a scouting report,

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:24.120
my boys only know basketball, farming
and school.

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:25.455
Probably in that order.

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:27.836
Most of them have never seen
a building taller than two stories,

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:31.089
except in a photograph,
so taking them to Indianapolis

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:34.377
to play in front of 15,000 people
is kind of like, uh...

01:30:34.554 --> 01:30:35.931
...y0u and me going to the moon.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.797
So what team we play
is the least of my concerns.

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:40.886
Will you be back
at Hickory next year?

01:30:41.061 --> 01:30:43.177
- Oh...
- [chatter]

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:46.889
It's a good question!

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:49.559
- One more question...
- [laughs]

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:56.398
No school this small has ever been
in the State Championship.

01:30:56.576 --> 01:30:58.362
I know. I was coach for a while.

01:30:58.536 --> 01:31:00.197
I won a big game for them.

01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:03.285
I was coaching the last two minutes.
I took them right down to the wire.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:06.621
I run the picket fence on them,
and we won!

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:09.287
And my son. My son, he's on...

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.003
- How you doing, Dad?
- [chuckles, stammers]

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:14.382
The conquering hero. I...

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:16.964
I heard the game
right there on that little Philco.

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:19.391
And I heard old Ollie
dribble on his foot,

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:21.173
and then make that charity shot.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:22.841
And I started bawling,

01:31:23.019 --> 01:31:26.728
and they bring the white coats in here
and they put a jacket on me.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:30.395
I was feeling so good
I didn't even mind too much.

01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:35.896
You doing good?

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:41.447
Well, I...

01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:46.745
...I feel real empty inside, and...

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:51.078
...I have some bad visions.

01:31:55.969 --> 01:31:57.255
Son...

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:01.592
The other night...

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:03.757
No, it don't matter, Dad.

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:06.260
You're gonna get better.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:18.026
Couple of months when you get
out of here, we're gonna get a house.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:22.947
Both of us.

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.531
I love you, Dad.

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:33.374
I gotta get back.

01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:36.711
<i>SQ“?</i>

01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:41.962
Oh, I wish I could be there.

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:44.556
I'll be thinking of you.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:51.563
Son, kick their butt.

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:05.323
Anyway, I'll tell you one thing.

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:10.663
No school this small has ever been
in the State Championship!

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:18.878
[sighs]

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.136
Hi, Coach Dale, Coach Butcher.

01:33:31.314 --> 01:33:33.180
- Welcome to Butler Fieldhouse.
- Thank you.

01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:36.441
Your practice schedule
is from 10:00 to 12:00.

01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:38.818
The game will be at 7:00.

01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:41.195
If you need anything,
why, just let me know.

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:44.108
And off the record,
I think this is the most exciting thing

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:45.787
that's ever happened
to Indiana basketball.

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:48.537
So, we're all behind you.
Good luck, and tear them up.

01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:51.164
- Thank you.
- Good luck, guys.

01:34:30.874 --> 01:34:31.864
Buddy?

01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:36.452
Hold this under the backboard.

01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:48.889
- What is it'?
- Fifteen feet.

01:34:49.058 --> 01:34:50.264
Fifteen feet.

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:52.551
Strap, put Ollie on your shoulders.

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:07.524
Measure this from the rim.

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:11.115
Buddy?

01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:19.582
How far?

01:35:19.756 --> 01:35:21.042
- Ten feet.
- Ten feet.

01:35:23.968 --> 01:35:26.300
I think you'll find this is
the exact same measurements

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:27.961
as our gym back in Hickory.

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:32.265
OK, let's get dressed for practice.

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.401
Hickory! [echoes]

01:35:51.913 --> 01:35:53.028
It is big.

01:35:57.418 --> 01:35:58.624
[man over PA] Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:35:58.795 --> 01:36:00.957
to the championship game

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:05.920
of the Indiana State
High School Basketball Tournament.

01:36:06.094 --> 01:36:09.177
The most incredible and
improbable confrontation

01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:11.509
in the illustrious history of the
Indiana High School

01:36:11.683 --> 01:36:15.267
Basketball Tournament takes place
in tonight's championship game,

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:18.394
<i>where the pint-sized, hardly
big enough for three syllables,</i>

01:36:18.564 --> 01:36:21.056
<i>Hickory Huskers, enrollment 64,</i>

01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:22.850

01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:25.189

01:36:25.363 --> 01:36:27.195

[applause, cheers]

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:14.493
And now, the starting lineup
for the Huskers.

01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:22.242
We've been all over this before.

01:37:23.588 --> 01:37:25.920
Their top player is Boyle, number 15.

01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:31.589
He, um...
averages about 20 points a game.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.635
Buddy, you gotta stick right with him.

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:40.428
No inside penetration.
Shut down those passing lanes.

01:37:40.605 --> 01:37:42.346
And you gotta play tough
off those boards.

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.900
Negate their height advantage.

01:37:44.067 --> 01:37:45.774
Hickory, it's time to take the floor.

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:50.187
- [man] I'll get the preacher.
- OK.

01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:55.988
We're way past big speech time.

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:02.328
I want to thank you
for the last few months.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:06.798
It's been very special for me.

01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:16.004
Anybody have anything they want to say?

01:38:16.766 --> 01:38:17.927
Yeah.

01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:20.225
Let's win this one for...

01:38:21.187 --> 01:38:23.929
...all the small schools
that never had a chance to get here.

01:38:24.982 --> 01:38:26.188
OK.

01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:29.400
I want to win for my dad.

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:33.939
- Let's win for coach, who got us here.
- [boy] Yeah.

01:38:34.117 --> 01:38:35.607
Thank you.

01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:50.164
[man] "With God of heaven,
it is all one

01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:55.336

or a small company...

...for the victory of battle
standeth not in the multitude of host,

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:04.061

"And David put his hand in the bag,
and took out a stone and slung it...

...and it struck the Philistine

01:39:19.412 --> 01:39:21.028
...and he fell to the ground."

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:23.534
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:25.581
Amen.

01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:35.546
Let's g0, GUYS-

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:41.138
I love you guys.

01:39:42.351 --> 01:39:42.886
[all] Team!

01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:00.742
[grunting]

01:40:57.301 --> 01:40:59.417
Call time out. Time out!

01:41:00.513 --> 01:41:01.594
[whistle blows]

01:41:04.058 --> 01:41:06.299
[man] Time out, Hickory.

01:41:11.482 --> 01:41:14.190
- God, these guys are good.
- This is embarrassing.

01:41:14.569 --> 01:41:16.230
I can't stop that guy.

01:41:17.196 --> 01:41:18.903
Maybe they were right about us.

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:20.984
Maybe we don't belong up here.

01:41:21.158 --> 01:41:22.899
Let's go. Come on!

01:41:25.288 --> 01:41:26.653
- Coach, can I say something?
- Yeah!

01:41:26.831 --> 01:41:29.619
I think Jimmy can take the guy
that's guarding him if we set him up.

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:31.328
What about it, Jimmy?

01:41:33.170 --> 01:41:35.081

give it to Merle on the picket fence.
