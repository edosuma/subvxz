00:01.237 --> 00:02.320
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:02.371 --> 00:03.988
Our Agent Dunham...
Did she meet Gunther?

00:04.040 --> 00:04.989
She's on the other side.

00:05.041 --> 00:06.708
Focused on the task at hand.

00:06.792 --> 00:08.426
How'd you do it?

00:08.494 --> 00:09.427
How'd you replace our Olivia?

00:09.495 --> 00:10.428
And whatever happens to me,

00:10.496 --> 00:11.546
I want you to know that

00:11.631 --> 00:13.048
this started out
as an assignment,

00:13.132 --> 00:15.333
- but it became...
- Something more.

00:15.384 --> 00:17.886
She's been infected
with a deadly parasite.

00:17.970 --> 00:18.887
What do you see, Frank?

00:18.971 --> 00:20.138
The picture on the sonogram...

00:20.189 --> 00:21.306
- Uh-huh?
- You're not infected.

00:21.357 --> 00:23.542
You're pregnant.

00:23.609 --> 00:26.194
I heard the news.

00:26.279 --> 00:28.063
You'll have whatever
resources you need.

00:28.147 --> 00:32.183
After all, you are the mother
of my future grandchild.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.698
You're almost done.

00:46.766 --> 00:48.466
How long till
we get the results?

00:48.534 --> 00:51.086
I arranged to
have the labs run in-house.

00:51.170 --> 00:52.921
We'll know
by the end of the day.

00:53.005 --> 00:55.757
Well, you know,
if Rachel was a carrier, then...

00:55.841 --> 00:58.893
Honey, you are a different
person than your sister.

00:58.978 --> 01:02.264
Nothing is set in stone.

01:04.349 --> 01:06.935
Rosa, would you please
talk to her?

01:07.019 --> 01:10.188
Viral propagated eclampsia
is dormant until pregnancy

01:10.239 --> 01:13.358
and undetectable
before eight to ten weeks.

01:13.409 --> 01:15.610
So until we get the results
of today's screening,

01:15.695 --> 01:16.861
nothing is certain.

01:16.912 --> 01:19.030
You may not be
a carrier at all.

01:19.081 --> 01:21.399
Okay.

01:21.450 --> 01:22.701
But it's hard to believe that

01:22.752 --> 01:25.570
when the odds
are 80% that I am.

01:25.621 --> 01:28.823
On average. And, yes,
the fact that Rachel had VPE

01:28.891 --> 01:30.759
puts you in
the highest risk group.

01:30.843 --> 01:32.627
It's okay to want
to prepare yourself.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.799
Look...

01:37.883 --> 01:39.917
I know it's easier
said than done,

01:39.969 --> 01:43.471
but my best advice
to both of you

01:43.556 --> 01:46.107
is take it a step at a time.

01:54.784 --> 01:57.485
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

01:57.570 --> 02:00.071
- There's still a chance...
- Mom, you weren't listening, were you?

02:00.122 --> 02:01.823
There is an eight
out of ten chance

02:01.907 --> 02:03.441
that I'm a carrier,
and if I am,

02:03.492 --> 02:05.276
there's only a handful of cases

02:05.328 --> 02:09.464
where either a mother or a baby
survive delivery with VPE.

02:09.548 --> 02:11.949
So I don't really
have a choice.

02:17.223 --> 02:19.808
And let's face it.
I mean, I'm alone.

02:19.892 --> 02:21.309
My job is all-consuming.

02:21.394 --> 02:23.728
My life is hardly
conducive to parenting.

02:25.848 --> 02:27.065
Well, what about the father?

02:27.132 --> 02:29.133
Oh, we've been over this.

02:29.185 --> 02:32.070
You met a man in a bar
while Frank was out of town...

02:32.137 --> 02:33.355
Honey, that just doesn't
sound like you.

02:33.439 --> 02:35.657
Well, I never said that it was
one of my finest moments.

02:35.741 --> 02:36.825
Well, I'm sorry,
but I don't mean to be...

02:36.909 --> 02:37.826
Judgmental?

02:37.910 --> 02:40.028
Judgmental. I...

02:42.531 --> 02:45.083
I just want you to have
the support that you need.

02:45.150 --> 02:47.151
And I do.

02:47.203 --> 02:50.422
You and Lincoln should
get together and commiserate.

02:50.489 --> 02:54.376
He's not happy
about this either.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.677
That doesn't change the fact

02:55.761 --> 02:57.595
that you'd make a wonderful
mother someday.

02:59.998 --> 03:01.666
Mom...

03:14.613 --> 03:16.180
Okay.
Thanks for driving me.

03:16.232 --> 03:18.099
Are you sure you're okay?

03:18.167 --> 03:20.184
I can come upstairs
with you if you like.

03:20.236 --> 03:22.153
No, I'm good.

03:22.204 --> 03:23.872
All right, listen, call me

03:23.956 --> 03:25.657
as soon as you hear anything,
good or bad.

03:25.708 --> 03:27.375
- I will.
- I love you.

03:27.460 --> 03:28.793
Me too. Bye.

03:40.539 --> 03:41.589
Dunham.

03:41.674 --> 03:43.057
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

03:43.142 --> 03:44.976
Hey.

03:46.228 --> 03:47.762
You okay?
You sound distracted.

03:50.149 --> 03:52.167
No, I'm good.

03:56.739 --> 03:59.107
You know, I'm probably
just being paranoid.

03:59.191 --> 04:01.609
I didn't actually see anybody.

04:01.694 --> 04:03.227
<i>But you said you
saw someone yesterday.</i>

04:03.279 --> 04:04.813
I... I think so.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.781
I mean, I thought that I did.

04:06.866 --> 04:08.783
I'm sending over
a security detail.

04:08.868 --> 04:11.085
Lincoln, you really
don't have to do that.

04:11.170 --> 04:12.537
Well, I'm your
commanding officer,

04:12.588 --> 04:14.122
so your permission's
irrelevant.

04:14.206 --> 04:16.708
<i>Besides, if you're concerned
you're being followed,</i>

04:16.759 --> 04:19.127
<i>there's probably a reason.</i>

04:19.211 --> 04:21.796
<i>They'll be there
within the hour.</i>

04:21.880 --> 04:23.765
Okay.
Thank you, Lincoln.

04:23.849 --> 04:26.250
<i>Hang tight, Liv.</i>

05:05.352 --> 05:06.486
You're kidding me.

05:06.570 --> 05:08.354
You went on a date
with bug girl?

05:08.439 --> 05:09.856
Oh, you're so smug.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.574
You know,
at least I make attempts.

05:11.642 --> 05:13.142
You don't even try to go out.

05:13.194 --> 05:14.360
That's because my new position

05:14.445 --> 05:15.812
demands the majority
of my time.

05:15.863 --> 05:17.080
Oh, your excuse is smug.

05:17.147 --> 05:18.364
Excuse me, Sir,

05:18.449 --> 05:20.483
the detail you requested
has reached the location.

05:20.534 --> 05:21.668
Let me know as soon
as they're in place.

05:21.752 --> 05:23.119
Yes, Sir.

05:23.170 --> 05:24.587
Thank you, Agent.

05:24.655 --> 05:27.006
I already told you.
I'm not calling you sir.

05:27.091 --> 05:28.541
All right.
Then tell me about bug girl.

05:28.626 --> 05:30.543
All right.
First off, her name is Mona.

05:30.628 --> 05:31.544
Mona?

05:31.629 --> 05:33.296
It was tea, and, uh,

05:33.347 --> 05:34.297
I'm not going
any further than that.

05:34.348 --> 05:35.515
Why not?

05:35.599 --> 05:38.968
Buddy, why don't you stop
focusing on me

05:39.019 --> 05:41.888
and just admit...

05:41.972 --> 05:44.691
You've got a thing for Liv.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.943
That's ridiculous.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.511
Although I do think

05:48.562 --> 05:50.697
if she was going to cheat
on Frank with someone...

05:50.781 --> 05:53.149
You know what?
It's none of my business.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.401
Yeah. I knew that was
driving you crazy.

05:55.486 --> 05:57.370
This is Agent Lee.

05:57.455 --> 05:58.872
What?

05:58.956 --> 06:01.691
When?

06:01.742 --> 06:02.792
Sir, I understand

06:02.860 --> 06:04.127
you have strong reservations.

06:04.194 --> 06:05.695
But from everything we know,

06:05.746 --> 06:08.715
Peter is uniquely suited
to power the machine.

06:08.799 --> 06:12.201
And if we fail to determine
a reliable way

06:12.253 --> 06:13.202
to cross between worlds...

06:13.254 --> 06:16.806
I have already stated
my opinion.

06:16.874 --> 06:19.092
We are not experimenting
on children.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.144
I have made myself clear.

06:30.187 --> 06:31.187
Yes.

06:31.238 --> 06:32.388
<i>Mr. Secretary,</i>

06:32.439 --> 06:35.057
<i>Manhattan Fringe Division,
Agent Lee.</i>

06:35.109 --> 06:36.392
Agent Lee, what is it?

06:36.460 --> 06:37.694
<i>Sir, Olivia's been kidnapped.</i>

06:37.745 --> 06:38.962
What do you mean, kidnapped?

06:39.029 --> 06:41.364
Agent Dunham suspected
she was being followed.

06:41.415 --> 06:43.366
Security detail found
signs of a struggle

06:43.434 --> 06:45.752
<i>and her door was wide open.</i>

06:45.836 --> 06:47.203
Has anyone made contact
with demands?

06:47.254 --> 06:48.755
<i>Not yet, but I spoke to her
forty minutes ago,</i>

06:48.839 --> 06:49.789
<i>so it hasn't been long.</i>

06:49.874 --> 06:51.641
Have you contacted Echelon?

06:51.709 --> 06:52.842
As soon as I heard.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.627
They're activating
the satellite.

06:54.712 --> 06:57.413
I don't need to tell you,
Agent Lee,

06:57.464 --> 07:01.301
how crucial it is that this
matter be resolved safely.

07:01.385 --> 07:03.603
I want information
as you receive it.

07:03.687 --> 07:05.889
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

07:12.796 --> 07:15.064
Echelon satellite tracking online.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.102
Give me some good news.

07:20.154 --> 07:21.604
<i>- We got her, Sir.</i>
- Where?

07:21.655 --> 07:23.907
North Moore Street
moving east toward the harbor.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.658
Speed is fifty kilometers
per hour.

07:25.743 --> 07:27.827
Let's go!

07:33.584 --> 07:34.834
Prepare to make the transfer.

07:34.919 --> 07:37.286
<i>Let me know when
you're ready back there.</i>

07:45.429 --> 07:46.763
She stopped moving.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.598
Corner at Mason and Tobey.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.440
Box positions.
Front and back covered.

07:57.491 --> 07:58.524
On my signal.

08:19.763 --> 08:24.467
- Son of a bitch.
- They knew she had a tracker.

09:15.202 --> 09:16.986
What's next?

09:17.054 --> 09:19.188
Phase one has disrupted
the regulatory process.

09:19.239 --> 09:24.077
By now, all inhibitory
proteins should be blocked.

09:25.529 --> 09:28.230
Doctor, she's coming to.

09:28.282 --> 09:29.699
She's a fighter...

09:29.750 --> 09:32.001
Like they said.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.861
Let's put her back out.

10:09.156 --> 10:12.325
This will help with the pain.

10:12.409 --> 10:16.963
Good. You should start
feeling that right away.

10:17.047 --> 10:19.632
Let us know when she's ready.

10:32.563 --> 10:34.630
What are you doing?

10:34.681 --> 10:36.465
Just try to get some sleep.

10:36.517 --> 10:38.434
I'll come back
and check on you.

11:16.664 --> 11:18.615
So much for trackers
being classified.

11:18.666 --> 11:20.117
I mean, that was a waste
of valuable time.

11:20.168 --> 11:22.202
The trackers...
They're organic technology.

11:22.286 --> 11:23.754
Okay...
Which means what?

11:23.821 --> 11:25.372
They're distinct
in every person.

11:25.456 --> 11:28.208
And untraceable without
the Echelon protocol.

11:28.292 --> 11:29.760
So there's only one way
that the kidnappers

11:29.827 --> 11:31.294
would know about the trackers.

11:31.345 --> 11:33.380
Either this is an inside job
or someone sold the information.

11:33.464 --> 11:35.432
Excuse me, Agent Lee,

11:35.499 --> 11:37.184
I was told that you wanted
to see me right way.

11:37.268 --> 11:39.019
Yes. I need you to construct
a database.

11:39.103 --> 11:40.637
I want the names and background

11:40.688 --> 11:41.938
of everyone that has
clearance high enough

11:42.006 --> 11:43.640
to know about
our tracking protocol.

11:43.691 --> 11:44.975
Yes, Sir.
In the meantime,

11:45.026 --> 11:47.611
I think that you will
want to look at this.

11:49.597 --> 11:52.449
I've reviewed the traffic
for a three-block radius

11:52.516 --> 11:54.067
around Agent Dunham's
residence.

11:54.152 --> 11:56.069
There's an anomaly...
The same commercial vehicle

11:56.154 --> 11:58.738
has cruised past her building
six times in the past week.

11:58.823 --> 12:00.957
The chances of that
are 1 in 756,000.

12:01.025 --> 12:02.492
It is a clear
statistical outlier.

12:02.543 --> 12:03.877
You said a commercial vehicle?

12:03.961 --> 12:06.329
It's registered
to a livery service.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.933
Yo, he's crazy.

12:30.905 --> 12:33.323
Fringe Division!
Hands on the wheel!

12:33.390 --> 12:34.574
Get out of the car!

12:34.659 --> 12:36.293
Which one is it?

12:36.360 --> 12:37.911
Out of the car!

12:37.995 --> 12:40.247
- Okay, okay.
- Turn around!

12:41.332 --> 12:44.784
- Where's the show me?
- It's in the front seat.

12:44.869 --> 12:46.119
- Where's Agent Dunham?
- What?

12:46.204 --> 12:47.838
You've been driving
by her building... Why?

12:47.905 --> 12:49.739
I'm a cab driver.
I got fares all over.

12:51.209 --> 12:52.408
All right.

12:52.460 --> 12:54.344
I was worried about her.
That's all!

12:54.411 --> 12:56.596
Once in a while I drive by,
make sure she's okay.

12:56.681 --> 12:58.248
- That's not a crime.
- All right.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.517
Henry Arliss Higgins.
He lives on Hastings Avenue.

13:00.584 --> 13:03.086
Wife's Jasmine.
Daughter's Laura.

13:03.137 --> 13:06.139
How do you know her?

13:09.227 --> 13:10.527
Don't you push me, Henry.

13:10.594 --> 13:12.595
Agent Dunham happens to be
a very good friend of mine.

13:12.647 --> 13:13.914
Sure don't seem that way.

13:13.981 --> 13:15.365
Not from what she's told me.

13:15.432 --> 13:18.068
- You know Dunham.
- Yeah, I do. I know you too.

13:18.119 --> 13:20.820
This is the second time
you've pointed a gun at me.

13:20.905 --> 13:22.956
The first was the day
I met her.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.958
You're the cab driver
from the gas station.

13:25.042 --> 13:27.127
You helped her get away.

13:27.211 --> 13:29.996
Well, she...
She threatened me.

13:30.081 --> 13:33.449
- Where is she?
- How would I know?

13:33.501 --> 13:35.785
I didn't expect
she would come back here.

13:35.836 --> 13:38.388
What do you mean, back here?

13:56.574 --> 13:58.241
Don't move, please.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.364
Up her to fifty milligrams.

14:04.448 --> 14:06.166
That should keep her
knocked out.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.034
Fifty milligrams?

14:09.670 --> 14:12.655
Is there a problem?

14:12.707 --> 14:14.708
No, Doctor.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.126
Good.

14:16.177 --> 14:18.428
How's he doing?

14:18.495 --> 14:19.713
He's doing very well.

14:19.797 --> 14:22.465
Abdominal circumference 160,

14:22.516 --> 14:26.219
head 170,
bi-parietal diameter 40.

14:26.304 --> 14:28.521
Shouldn't be long now.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.473
I'll make sure
everything's ready.

14:30.524 --> 14:33.193
I'll administer the sedatives.

14:44.872 --> 14:46.790
It's time for your pill.

14:46.857 --> 14:49.576
- No, I...
- It's for your own good.

14:51.212 --> 14:52.712
There's no time for discussion.

14:52.797 --> 14:55.048
Now, do I need to call
the orderlies or not?

15:12.450 --> 15:13.800
Good girl.

15:13.868 --> 15:16.686
Now, just... relax.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.594
All I know is she was scared.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.880
She kept on saying people
were trying to convince her

15:43.931 --> 15:46.132
- that she was someone that she wasn't.
- What people?

15:46.200 --> 15:47.600
People she was
running away from.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.052
You guys, I guess.

15:49.103 --> 15:51.187
So she said
she wanted to go home.

15:51.255 --> 15:53.356
Yeah. To some guy.
Named Peter.

15:53.424 --> 15:55.308
Peter?

15:55.393 --> 15:56.693
That was his name.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.194
Look, I didn't want to get
involved in any of this.

15:58.262 --> 15:59.846
But she...

15:59.914 --> 16:02.499
She got to me.

16:02.566 --> 16:04.868
And you said after you
helped her

16:04.935 --> 16:06.369
get to Liberty Island,
you didn't see her again?

16:06.437 --> 16:09.072
I didn't expect to.

16:09.123 --> 16:11.591
Till I ran into her
a few weeks ago on the street.

16:11.659 --> 16:13.293
Only she acted like
she didn't know me.

16:13.377 --> 16:15.578
Like her mind got wiped.

16:15.629 --> 16:18.665
When someone knows you and
then all of a sudden they don't...

16:18.749 --> 16:21.801
I don't know.
I... I got worried.

16:21.886 --> 16:25.472
Look, I'm not trying to ruffle
any feathers here, guys.

16:25.556 --> 16:29.809
There's some things a guy like me
shouldn't know about. I get it.

16:29.894 --> 16:31.811
But you start hearing things
about some other universe...

16:31.896 --> 16:35.098
- It's hard to ignore.
- What did you just say?

16:35.149 --> 16:36.232
What about my taxi?

16:37.518 --> 16:40.737
Okay, this is...
seriously messed up.

16:40.804 --> 16:42.405
He knows way too many
details to be lying.

16:42.473 --> 16:43.606
What are you thinkin'?

16:43.657 --> 16:44.991
Remember after Liv's breakdown

16:45.076 --> 16:46.693
- when she came back to field duty?
- Yeah.

16:46.777 --> 16:48.294
You asked me if
I thought it was possible

16:48.362 --> 16:51.081
for our Olivia to be switched with
the one from the other universe.

16:51.148 --> 16:55.752
- And you said I was crazy.
- What if you're not?

16:59.173 --> 17:00.656
Hello?

17:00.708 --> 17:02.926
<i>Marilyn? It's Rosa.</i>

17:02.993 --> 17:04.493
I've left several messages
for Olivia,

17:04.545 --> 17:07.097
but I couldn't reach her.

17:07.164 --> 17:10.633
Oh, well... I'm sure something
must have come up at work.

17:10.684 --> 17:12.801
Do you have her
test results back?

17:12.853 --> 17:14.186
<i>Yes.</i>

17:14.255 --> 17:16.021
I'm sorry.

17:16.107 --> 17:18.191
Olivia is a carrier for VPE.

17:20.194 --> 17:22.645
<i>Listen, I'd like Olivia to meet
with a trauma counselor</i>

17:22.695 --> 17:25.198
<i>here on staff, Beau Amaral.</i>

17:25.281 --> 17:27.534
<i>He's wonderful.
He can talk to her.</i>

17:27.617 --> 17:29.869
I'm sure that'll be helpful.

17:31.238 --> 17:33.022
<i>Marilyn?</i>

17:33.073 --> 17:34.690
I'm here.

17:34.742 --> 17:37.210
<i>Tell Olivia to call me
when you talk to her.</i>

17:37.294 --> 17:40.346
<i>I'd like to schedule the procedure
as soon as possible</i>

17:40.414 --> 17:43.583
<i>before there's
any risk to her health.</i>

17:43.667 --> 17:46.152
Okay, I'll tell her
just as soon as she calls back.

17:46.220 --> 17:49.088
<i>Thank you, Rosa. Bye.</i>

19:23.100 --> 19:25.268
Doctor, we're ready.

19:25.319 --> 19:26.686
What...

19:26.770 --> 19:29.155
What...
What are you doing to me?

19:45.635 --> 19:47.886
And this all from a cab driver.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.773
Yes.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.792
With all due respect, Sir...

19:53.860 --> 19:58.580
If there's any truth to what
he's saying, it could be a lead.

20:00.183 --> 20:02.234
I need to know.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.421
Was our Agent Dunham
replaced with theirs?

20:16.683 --> 20:18.600
She was. Yes.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.390
And during that time,

20:24.441 --> 20:27.092
our Agent Dunham infiltrated
their Fringe Division.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.895
I wish I was told sooner.

20:31.181 --> 20:33.465
You weren't told
because it was classified.

20:36.436 --> 20:40.289
Our Agent Dunham returned
safely to our side weeks ago.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.791
And theirs?

20:45.778 --> 20:46.862
Was sent home.

20:53.636 --> 20:56.221
I'm beginning to think that...

20:56.289 --> 20:59.792
Not sharing this information

20:59.859 --> 21:02.461
may hinder your ability
to find Olivia.

21:04.314 --> 21:06.348
What are you thinking?

21:06.433 --> 21:10.319
That this all may have something
to do with her abduction?

21:15.992 --> 21:19.495
Agent Dunham
is carrying my grandchild.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.771
It wasn't part of the mission.

21:29.839 --> 21:35.427
When she was on the other side,
Olivia and my son got close.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.330
I believed the child
and Olivia would be safer

21:38.381 --> 21:40.716
if no one knew the truth.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.853
Who else knows about this?

21:44.921 --> 21:49.608
As far as I know,
just Olivia and I.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.995
Do you think she could
have been taken

21:53.062 --> 21:54.196
by invaders
from the other side?

21:58.117 --> 22:00.986
I imagine it's possible.

22:05.208 --> 22:09.027
Or, if as you suggest...

22:09.095 --> 22:11.497
That this could be
an inside job.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.250
None of us is without enemies.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.538
You're suggesting
this may be about you?

22:27.213 --> 22:31.567
My son was taken from me,
Agent Lee.

22:31.651 --> 22:35.103
The notion that I might lose
my future grandchild

22:35.188 --> 22:36.788
is simply impossible.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.407
I will answer your questions.

22:38.491 --> 22:43.695
I will give you complete access
to Olivia's mission files.

22:43.746 --> 22:46.848
Whatever it takes... Find her.

22:50.853 --> 22:52.504
I'll do my best, Sir.

23:45.725 --> 23:48.760
How are her ligaments doing?

23:48.811 --> 23:51.229
Supple.
The chemicals are working.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.514
Okay.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.434
Calibrate the joint expander
to 18 degrees.

23:55.485 --> 23:58.904
If her bone can withstand it,
increase to 23.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.830
Hemoglobin count 6.7.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.832
That's low.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.668
I agree.
It's borderline.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.921
Utero-placental blood flow
is inadequate.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.673
Is her pain management
on schedule?

24:17.740 --> 24:19.007
Yes, Doctor.

24:19.092 --> 24:21.343
I gave her the last sedative
twenty minutes ago.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.512
Administer another twelve units
of plasma immediately.

24:23.579 --> 24:28.016
- This will be her fifth transfusion.
- Duly noted.

24:28.101 --> 24:29.601
Acceleration at this rate
is difficult

24:29.669 --> 24:31.386
in the best of circumstances.

24:31.471 --> 24:32.754
With her erratic vitals...

24:32.822 --> 24:34.523
We will take
appropriate precautions.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.475
I'm not sure they exist.
If her body isn't ready...

24:36.526 --> 24:39.344
We have the timetable.
There will be no adjustments.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.480
Initiate phase two.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.387
Have you emptied your bladder?

25:05.471 --> 25:08.039
Yeah, I feel really kinda dizzy.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.375
Did you empty your bladder?

25:28.995 --> 25:30.595
You're an obstetric nurse.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.248
You must feel
some kind of calling

25:33.332 --> 25:35.117
to do something so selfless.

25:35.184 --> 25:39.838
You know, to help women
bring babies into the world.

25:47.764 --> 25:49.798
I think I may have VPE.

25:51.584 --> 25:54.019
In fact, I probably do.

25:56.105 --> 25:59.775
My sister and her baby
didn't make it through labor.

26:01.527 --> 26:03.645
Both their hearts gave out.

26:09.869 --> 26:13.038
You cannot be okay
with what they're doing to me.

26:13.105 --> 26:15.373
If you don't make them stop,
then they're gonna kill me

26:15.441 --> 26:18.427
and they're gonna kill
the child that I'm carrying.

26:23.833 --> 26:28.737
You don't have to do...
anything.

26:28.805 --> 26:31.389
You just have to leave me
alone just for a minute.

26:39.015 --> 26:41.016
Please.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.487
Okay?

26:51.160 --> 26:53.829
We're starting the next
phase in 22 minutes.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.614
And believe me,
you don't wanna be standing

26:55.665 --> 26:58.116
when it happens,
so stop wasting time.

26:58.167 --> 27:01.586
Empty your bladder
and let's get on with this.

27:04.841 --> 27:06.091
Whoever kidnapped Olivia

27:06.158 --> 27:08.510
knew she was implanted
with a subcutaneous tracker.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.495
All employees
with level five clearance

27:10.546 --> 27:12.681
had access to the biometric
tracking protocol.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.349
I complied the database,

27:14.433 --> 27:16.668
but without another variable,
the list is fairly extensive.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.136
We have another one.

27:18.187 --> 27:20.689
What we're about to tell you
requires level ten clearance.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.808
Sir, I'm nowhere
near that level.

27:22.859 --> 27:24.893
Concerning this matter,
you are now.

27:24.977 --> 27:25.977
What is it?

27:27.647 --> 27:30.982
Agent Dunham is pregnant with
Secretary Bishop's grandchild.

27:31.033 --> 27:32.818
Oh, I see.

27:32.869 --> 27:35.704
I'll start by cross-referencing
agents with clearance

27:35.788 --> 27:36.905
with those who also had access

27:36.989 --> 27:38.790
to Agent Dunham's
medical records.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.126
Let me know
as soon as you're done.

27:43.713 --> 27:45.380
Marilyn's here.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.548
Did you call her?

27:46.632 --> 27:47.883
I thought it was time she knew.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.669
I sure don't want to do this.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.555
All right, listen,
I'll talk to her.

27:53.639 --> 27:56.141
You deal with Travis Bickle.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.511
Come on. Coppola...

27:59.562 --> 28:01.646
"You talkin' to me?"

28:01.714 --> 28:02.647
No idea.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.716
All right.
Point is,

28:04.767 --> 28:06.601
Henry's probably
done with his statement.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.436
I'll deal with Marilyn.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.022
- Thank you, Charlie.
- Yeah, buddy.

28:13.175 --> 28:14.910
We're working every lead.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.661
Every agent in this office,

28:16.729 --> 28:19.230
they're doing everything
they can to find her.

28:19.282 --> 28:21.399
How long has she been missing?

28:21.450 --> 28:23.368
Hmm?

28:23.419 --> 28:27.005
I knew that something
was wrong because...

28:27.072 --> 28:29.374
Dr. Oporto said she wasn't
answering her phone calls.

28:29.425 --> 28:31.543
Who's Dr. Oporto?

28:33.763 --> 28:35.330
It's her obstetrician.

28:38.634 --> 28:42.470
There's a possibility that...

28:42.555 --> 28:45.190
Her kidnapping

28:45.257 --> 28:49.394
- relates to her pregnancy.
- She can't have the baby.

28:51.197 --> 28:55.917
There's... There's no way
she can have the baby.

29:04.610 --> 29:07.162
You need help
with your slippers?

29:07.246 --> 29:08.780
No.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.067
You're gonna get me
out of here.

29:29.134 --> 29:30.185
You're making a big mistake.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.020
Help! In here!

29:40.246 --> 29:41.279
You can't leave!

29:41.330 --> 29:43.114
Either I leave
or you bleed to death.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.930
Where is she?

30:00.182 --> 30:01.516
Don't worry.
She won't get far.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.589
Hey! Hey.

30:41.674 --> 30:43.641
Please, can you let me in?

30:43.709 --> 30:48.212
Hey!

30:48.264 --> 30:49.714
Help me!

30:49.765 --> 30:53.101
Oh!

31:32.943 --> 31:34.226
Impound brought
your cab around.

31:34.277 --> 31:35.661
It should be waiting
for you on B-4.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.246
Valet service, huh?

31:37.330 --> 31:39.398
Look, I know
you still have questions,

31:39.449 --> 31:41.083
but I can't impress
this on you enough...

31:41.168 --> 31:43.202
What we've talked about
is restricted information.

31:43.253 --> 31:44.503
Ah, don't worry.
I'm not talking.

31:44.571 --> 31:46.505
Not that anyone
would believe me anyhow.

31:46.573 --> 31:48.457
This is Agent Lee.

31:48.542 --> 31:50.426
<i>- Lincoln!</i>
- Oh, my God, Olivia.

31:50.510 --> 31:52.094
Where are you?

31:52.179 --> 31:54.079
<i>I'm in Chinatown.
I'm not exactly sure where.</i>

31:54.130 --> 31:55.381
Listen carefully.
I want you to look around

31:55.432 --> 31:56.382
and tell me what you see.

31:56.433 --> 31:58.133
Okay. I see a...

31:58.218 --> 31:59.602
A dragon. It's red.

31:59.686 --> 32:01.253
And there's a noodle store.

32:01.304 --> 32:02.921
Listen, Lincoln,
I need a doctor.

32:02.973 --> 32:05.441
I think... I think that
the baby's coming.

32:05.525 --> 32:06.692
What?

32:06.759 --> 32:08.944
<i>They accelerated the pregnancy.</i>

32:09.029 --> 32:10.262
All right.
You're gonna be okay.

32:10.313 --> 32:13.932
I need you to speak
to my mo... ther!

32:13.984 --> 32:15.734
Liv, what's happening?

32:16.820 --> 32:18.070
<i>Olivia, can you hear me?</i>

32:22.909 --> 32:25.794
I need a trace on that call
that originated in Chinatown!

32:25.879 --> 32:28.247
- I know a shortcut.
- Yeah?

32:28.298 --> 32:31.050
I'm a cabbie.
I know every shortcut.

32:39.593 --> 32:40.959
What's wrong with you?

32:41.011 --> 32:43.646
Oh, God, I need help!

32:43.730 --> 32:45.681
Oh!

32:50.103 --> 32:52.521
She called from a phone booth.
Canal and Market.

32:52.606 --> 32:54.023
Did you get that?

32:54.107 --> 32:56.642
- Canal and Market. Got it.
- Yeah. We're close.

32:56.693 --> 32:59.194
- What about the medical team?
- They're en route.

32:59.279 --> 33:00.979
<i>Tell them she's in labor.</i>

33:01.031 --> 33:02.147
That's impossible.

33:02.198 --> 33:03.815
No. They accelerated
her pregnancy.

33:03.867 --> 33:06.368
Lincoln. Listen to me.

33:06.453 --> 33:09.922
I spoke to Marilyn.
There's something wrong.

33:09.989 --> 33:12.424
<i>She won't make it
through delivery.</i>

33:17.297 --> 33:19.048
Fringe Division!

33:19.132 --> 33:20.849
- Out of the way!
- You heard him! Please!

33:20.934 --> 33:23.936
Oh! Oh, Lincoln,
I think the baby's coming.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.437
Let's get her inside.

33:29.392 --> 33:30.842
Right here, right here.

33:36.683 --> 33:39.351
Olivia...

33:39.402 --> 33:41.654
My name is Henry.

33:41.705 --> 33:44.657
I delivered my little girl
in the back of my cab.

33:44.708 --> 33:46.625
It's not exactly
a medical degree,

33:46.693 --> 33:48.744
but I can help out
until the ambulance arrives.

33:48.828 --> 33:52.081
- You can trust him.
- Okay.

33:52.165 --> 33:57.169
- It's nice to meet you, Henry.
- Yeah. You too.

33:57.220 --> 34:00.022
- May I?
- Sure.

34:00.090 --> 34:01.507
Now, get your knees up.
Okay?

34:01.558 --> 34:04.176
Easy. Okay?
Nice and easy.

34:07.597 --> 34:09.514
Lincoln, did you talk
to my mom?

34:22.829 --> 34:24.029
Oh, God.

34:24.080 --> 34:27.565
Just squeeze my hand.
As hard as you need to.

34:27.617 --> 34:29.195
You're feeling it like you
need to bear down.

34:29.206 --> 34:31.453
- Mm-hmm.
- That's okay. This baby on its way.

34:31.538 --> 34:32.571
You just look at me.

34:32.621 --> 34:34.072
You don't think about
an hour from now.

34:34.123 --> 34:35.257
You don't think about a minute.

34:35.342 --> 34:37.126
We're gonna focus
on this moment, okay?

34:37.210 --> 34:39.244
- It's you and me.
- God, I'm scared.

34:39.295 --> 34:41.013
Put your chin to your chest.
It'll help.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.266
Okay, and I need you to push.
One, two...

34:44.351 --> 34:46.418
Three.
Keep pushing, keep pushing.

34:46.469 --> 34:48.554
Four, five.

34:48.605 --> 34:50.389
That's good, that's good.
That's really good.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.306
You promise me that you will
stay until this is over.

34:52.391 --> 34:55.143
- There's no place else for me to be.
- That's it.

34:55.228 --> 34:56.945
You're doing so good.
Okay, you're almost there.

34:57.030 --> 35:00.449
Come on, push.
One, two...

35:00.533 --> 35:03.035
I love you.

35:05.822 --> 35:08.907
Promise me
you'll save the baby.

35:08.958 --> 35:11.276
Liv...

35:11.327 --> 35:13.529
Promise.

35:15.498 --> 35:16.948
Okay. I promise.

35:20.253 --> 35:22.287
Oh, my God, I see his head!

35:22.338 --> 35:23.789
All right, you gotta go.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.957
Keep going.
Keep going.

35:26.009 --> 35:28.977
Keep going!
There it is!

35:29.062 --> 35:30.763
There it is!
He's here.

35:34.601 --> 35:37.936
He's okay.
He's okay.

35:37.987 --> 35:39.288
You hear that?

35:42.075 --> 35:44.777
Liv?

35:56.039 --> 35:59.124
He made it.

36:01.261 --> 36:02.294
Oh...

36:05.598 --> 36:07.216
He's fine!

36:33.660 --> 36:35.327
You... You have a son.

36:44.537 --> 36:46.688
He's beautiful.

37:09.747 --> 37:11.882
I wonder what she's
gonna end up naming him.

37:11.949 --> 37:13.633
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

37:13.718 --> 37:15.752
I'll give you a hint.

37:15.803 --> 37:17.504
It's not Lincoln.

37:17.588 --> 37:19.172
You don't know
anything, do you?

37:19.257 --> 37:21.258
No, I don't.
But I had you going.

37:21.309 --> 37:22.342
Can't believe Liv's alone.

37:22.426 --> 37:24.561
Listen, you did
a good job, Sir.

37:24.628 --> 37:26.880
Broyles would be proud.

37:26.948 --> 37:29.432
Hold on.
Did you just say sir?

37:29.483 --> 37:30.817
Don't get used to it.

37:32.403 --> 37:34.354
Any news?

37:34.438 --> 37:36.523
We found the location
where they were holding her.

37:36.607 --> 37:38.191
Abandoned building
on Bayard Street.

37:38.259 --> 37:39.993
- Techs are there now.
- Have they found anything?

37:40.061 --> 37:41.528
No, Sir, not yet.

37:41.612 --> 37:43.079
I want security
assigned at all times.

37:43.147 --> 37:45.365
Until we find whoever did this,

37:45.449 --> 37:47.167
Agent Dunham and her baby
are still at risk.

37:47.251 --> 37:48.785
I've arranged
for Secret Service.

37:48.836 --> 37:52.088
There's an agent
outside her room right now.

37:52.156 --> 37:54.291
Thank you, Agent Lee.

37:54.342 --> 37:57.327
Your hard work
will not go unrewarded.

37:58.763 --> 38:01.715
I'll go up and...
meet my grandson.

38:01.799 --> 38:03.550
Yes, Sir.

38:08.339 --> 38:10.340
He should have told us.

38:10.391 --> 38:12.609
Which part?

38:15.679 --> 38:18.481
He's a miracle.

38:21.202 --> 38:23.286
They said it was
the acceleration.

38:23.354 --> 38:25.872
That the...
The virus couldn't replicate

38:25.957 --> 38:27.574
as fast as the pregnancy.

38:27.658 --> 38:30.076
Whatever the science is...

38:30.161 --> 38:33.163
He's still a miracle.

38:39.287 --> 38:42.239
They put
an imposter on our team

38:42.306 --> 38:44.224
to protect their mission.

38:44.292 --> 38:45.976
And do the math.

38:46.043 --> 38:47.978
Olivia, when she came back...

38:48.045 --> 38:52.015
Wasn't it around the time
Broyles disappeared?

38:52.066 --> 38:53.883
It was.

38:56.070 --> 38:59.422
Makes you wonder what else
we don't know.

39:02.059 --> 39:04.344
Yes, it does.

39:11.535 --> 39:13.453
As soon as I found out
I was pregnant,

39:13.537 --> 39:14.921
all I did was think about

39:15.006 --> 39:16.906
whether or not
I had the condition.

39:16.958 --> 39:21.244
I never actually spent any time
thinking about...

39:21.312 --> 39:22.762
Being a mom.

39:22.847 --> 39:25.131
I mean, I...

39:25.216 --> 39:28.218
Now I just...
I don't know if I'm ready.

39:29.553 --> 39:32.272
To tell you the truth,
all you need to do is love him.

39:32.356 --> 39:36.026
And you can figure out
the rest as you go on.

39:37.895 --> 39:40.447
I'm gonna need your help.

39:40.531 --> 39:42.582
I hope so.

39:46.203 --> 39:48.238
Sorry to interrupt.

39:48.289 --> 39:51.374
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

39:51.442 --> 39:52.876
I'll be right back.

39:52.943 --> 39:56.296
- Do you mind if I tag along?
- Not at all.

40:03.287 --> 40:06.423
You're a handsome
little fellow, aren't you?

40:24.658 --> 40:27.610
Oh, sweetie!
Ooh!

40:27.661 --> 40:29.779
That goes to the lab.

40:29.830 --> 40:34.317
What a good boy.

40:34.368 --> 40:38.538
It's okay.
It's okay, sweetie.

40:38.622 --> 40:42.709
- There's your grandson back.
- Oh!

40:42.793 --> 40:46.763
Yes! You are so brave.

40:46.830 --> 40:48.431
Yes!

41:26.337 --> 41:30.457
It is happening.

41:47.741 --> 41:49.826
Why did you tell
Lincoln so much?

41:49.894 --> 41:52.512
He's a good agent.

41:52.580 --> 41:55.498
And smart.

41:55.566 --> 41:57.817
The lie would have made him
grow suspicious.

41:57.885 --> 42:02.622
And I trusted
that you wouldn't fail.

42:05.209 --> 42:08.344
We didn't.
