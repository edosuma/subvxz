<i>BOURG: Je ne dirai rien.</i>

00:12.761 --> 00:13.961
<i>Je ne dirai rien.</i>

00:21.281 --> 00:23.281
Je ne dirai rien.

00:23.761 --> 00:25.601
Je ne dirai rien.

<i>WOMAN". "The Mock Turtle said,</i>

00:39.121 --> 00:43.321
<i>'No wise fish would go anywhere
without a porpoise.'</i>

00:44.561 --> 00:49.321
<i>'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice
in a tone of great surprise.</i>

00:50.041 --> 00:53.401
<i>'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:</i>

00:53.881 --> 01:00.041
'why, if a fish came to me,
and told me he was going a journey,

01:00.281 --> 01:04.161
I should say, "With what porpoise?"'

01:06.361 --> 01:09.921
'Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.

01:10.761 --> 01:15.201
'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied
in an offended tone.

01:15.921 --> 01:21.001
And the Gryphon added,
'Come, let's hear some of your adventures."'

01:21.841 --> 01:23.241
Now you read.

01:23.401 --> 01:25.041
"'I could tell you my adventures...“

01:25.201 --> 01:27.481
- Ad-ventures.
- "'..adventures

01:27.641 --> 01:31.161
beginning from this morning,' said Alice
a little timidly: 'but..."'

01:31.321 --> 01:32.601
(Door slams)

01:45.201 --> 01:46.881
OK, continue. Continue.

01:47.041 --> 01:52.761
"'It's no use going back to yesterday
because I was a different person then.

01:52.921 --> 01:55.401
Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle."

01:55.601 --> 02:00.801
"'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon
in an impatient tone."

02:29.801 --> 02:31.481
(Knocking)

02:34.601 --> 02:36.601
It's open.

02:50.441 --> 02:52.441
Thanks.

02:57.641 --> 03:01.361
What you have seen,
no father should ever see.

03:03.521 --> 03:05.361
But I thought you should know,

03:10.521 --> 03:12.641
we found something else on that tape.

03:22.521 --> 03:25.641
♪ Oh, my love

03:25.801 --> 03:29.441
♪ We pray each day

03:29.601 --> 03:32.801
♪ May you come home

03:32.961 --> 03:36.681
♪ And be OK

03:43.921 --> 03:48.041
♪ For now we wait for you

03:48.721 --> 03:52.641
♪ For you to come home

04:09.241 --> 04:10.481
(Speaks in French)

04:38.481 --> 04:39.681
So, er...

04:39.841 --> 04:43.561
Somebody told the press
about Tony Hughes assaulting that man.

04:43.721 --> 04:47.641
- You think it was him?
- Yes. And I want him kept far from this case.

04:47.801 --> 04:49.321
Especially after this.

04:49.481 --> 04:50.681
Laurence?

04:50.841 --> 04:52.841
Excuse me.

04:56.921 --> 05:00.281
These caids des cités, there are not many
who would speak about their activities

05:00.441 --> 05:02.201
for fear of ending up like Antoine.

05:03.121 --> 05:06.441
But there is someone who might know
what information he had for us.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.041
His girlfriend.

05:09.921 --> 05:11.161
You should come.

05:11.321 --> 05:13.321
I've been called back to London.

05:14.001 --> 05:18.401
So, if Oliver Hughes is the victim
of some sort of trafficking gang,

05:18.561 --> 05:21.961
after five days,
what are the chances of finding him alive?

05:30.481 --> 05:32.001
(Sighs) Mark.

05:32.161 --> 05:34.361
I think perhaps you should come with me.

05:49.921 --> 05:51.921
I'll get this.

06:00.641 --> 06:02.641
(Emily sobs)

06:03.681 --> 06:05.681
Emily.

06:20.361 --> 06:22.361
(Continues sobbing)

06:26.481 --> 06:28.361
Ssh.

06:33.681 --> 06:35.681
(Vehicle approaches)

06:37.561 --> 06:39.121
(Car horn)

06:45.601 --> 06:47.121
(Clamour of voices)

06:49.441 --> 06:50.881
Out of the way.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.801
Get the cameras out of her face.

06:52.961 --> 06:55.161
- Get back, get back.
- Emily, what's happened?

06:55.321 --> 06:58.641
She was at the swimming pool, freezing cold.
She needs to rest.

06:58.801 --> 07:00.161
Emily?

07:00.321 --> 07:01.521
Hey, he)'-

07:01.681 --> 07:03.681
What happened? Are you all right?

07:03.921 --> 07:05.721
I saw him.

07:05.881 --> 07:07.801
What?

07:07.961 --> 07:10.361
- What, love?
- I saw him.

07:10.521 --> 07:11.601
OK, come on. Let's get in.

07:11.761 --> 07:13.761
(Clamour continues)

07:18.721 --> 07:20.721
I'm sorry.

07:24.041 --> 07:26.041
I know you blame me.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.041
I blame myself.

07:41.681 --> 07:43.681
We'll find him.

07:46.801 --> 07:48.801
I promise.

07:51.521 --> 07:53.521
We will find him.

08:18.161 --> 08:20.161
Malik Suri.

08:21.001 --> 08:25.121
You should be ashamed of yourself,
kicking a family when it's down like that.

08:26.041 --> 08:28.521
I'm a journalist, Detective.
I was just doing my job.

08:28.681 --> 08:30.681
- You're a leech.
- A leech?

08:31.921 --> 08:33.921
Really?

08:34.481 --> 08:38.561
So am I the first person to make a living
from writing about the misfortune of others?

08:39.961 --> 08:42.041
When someone
writes a book about the holocaust,

08:42.201 --> 08:44.721
or a bestseller about some genocidal dictator,

08:44.881 --> 08:47.441
- does that make them a leech too?
- Tony Hughes was cleared.

08:47.601 --> 08:50.921
But thanks to the article you wrote
with information you acquired illegally,

08:51.081 --> 08:53.041
that shadow is going to follow him
for a long time.

08:53.201 --> 08:54.681
I reported the truth.

08:54.841 --> 08:56.441
Nothing more.

08:56.601 --> 09:00.401
And today I'm meeting with the Telegraph
for a permanent position.

09:01.841 --> 09:04.681
You know, it may be that the worst day
in that family's life

09:04.841 --> 09:07.041
could turn out to be the best day of mine.

09:07.201 --> 09:09.721
It's Newton's law of motion:
every action has a reaction.

09:09.881 --> 09:11.681
It might not be fair, but that's life.

09:11.841 --> 09:13.841
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

09:17.201 --> 09:19.681
You know,
we should do an interview sometime.

09:20.681 --> 09:24.921
Yeah, be good to know what the spare part
in the investigation has to say about it all.

09:41.401 --> 09:43.801
Bonjour. I'm looking for...

09:43.961 --> 09:46.481
Tony! Come on up.

09:47.241 --> 09:48.681
Thanks.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.841
- Get past the press OK?
- Yeah, I managed to shake them off.

10:01.121 --> 10:05.161
Since the article came out, it's been
feeding time at the zoo back at the hotel.

10:05.321 --> 10:06.921
I'm sorry to drag you here.

10:07.081 --> 10:11.041
I wanted to come to you but I'm having
a nightmare with this hospital we're building.

10:11.201 --> 10:12.481
This shouldn't take too long.

10:12.641 --> 10:15.401
I've put the money into a new account.
I want you to be a signatory

10:15.561 --> 10:18.801
because I don't want you to have to come
running to me every time you need it.

10:18.961 --> 10:21.561
Ian, this is your money. I can't...

10:22.601 --> 10:25.521
I'm not asking for permission here.
This is non-negotiable.

10:25.681 --> 10:28.201
When I do something, Tony, I follow it through.

10:28.361 --> 10:32.001
Pisses my wife off no end, but that's me.
Take it or leave it.

10:32.601 --> 10:35.801
Whatever it takes to get your boy back, yeah?

10:38.681 --> 10:40.081
I appreciate it.

10:40.241 --> 10:42.161
Truly.

10:42.321 --> 10:44.721
- You're a good man.
- Tell that to the wife.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.481
What happened there?

10:55.001 --> 10:57.601
I broke into Vincent Bourg's flat last night.

10:58.481 --> 11:01.001
- You did what?
- That's how I cut my hand.

11:01.161 --> 11:06.161
I was looking around for anything, anything,
and then he came back.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.761
Did he say anything?

11:09.921 --> 11:11.921
Nothing.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.401
Vincent Bourg has been cleared.

11:21.001 --> 11:23.001
A solid alibi.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.601
Now, I'm good pals with Georges Deloix.

11:26.921 --> 11:29.841
He's a juge d'instruction
in the Palais de Justice here.

11:30.001 --> 11:32.881
I'm making sure he keeps me
up to date on this case,

11:33.041 --> 11:37.921
and I promise you, if there was
a shred of doubt about this guy Bourg,

11:38.081 --> 11:39.761
I would be on it like a flash.

11:40.561 --> 11:43.321
Now let's let the police do what they do.

11:43.801 --> 11:46.961
Our end is getting your story out there.

11:47.161 --> 11:49.161
Encourage people to come forward.

11:50.241 --> 11:52.241
That's what we can do to help.

11:55.641 --> 11:57.641
Thank you.

12:15.241 --> 12:17.761
(Exchange in French)

12:17.921 --> 12:20.001
(Conversation continues)

12:22.801 --> 12:24.801
(Continues)

12:31.601 --> 12:34.281
(Louder) Je ne dirai rien.

12:38.681 --> 12:40.321
What did you say?

12:40.481 --> 12:41.641
Pardon?

12:41.801 --> 12:45.721
To the man, you said, "Je ne dir..."

12:46.841 --> 12:52.401
No. The man, he says to me
don't tell his wife that he is smoking.

12:52.681 --> 12:54.681
Or he is in danger, you know?

12:55.121 --> 12:57.401
I know his wife.

12:57.561 --> 13:00.321
So, I say to him, "Je ne dirai rien."

13:01.361 --> 13:04.321
It means, "I will not say anything."

13:06.561 --> 13:08.041
OK?

13:10.321 --> 13:11.721
Monsieur...

13:21.401 --> 13:23.401
(Rap music plays in background)

13:45.041 --> 13:46.201
Non.

14:43.961 --> 14:45.961
(Both chuckle)

14:53.441 --> 14:55.121
- (Both laugh)
- Merci.

15:07.481 --> 15:09.481
<i>(Rowdy chatter)</i>

15:13.881 --> 15:16.241
This image cannot be made any clearer.

15:17.321 --> 15:21.881
There is no way of identifying the men
who pulled Oliver away from the window.

15:22.601 --> 15:24.441
But the tape continues and...

15:25.481 --> 15:26.681
<i>(Rowdy chatter)</i>

15:30.881 --> 15:33.201
This is where it jumps to the next morning.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.321
The mother has picked up the camera
to tidy it away.

15:37.481 --> 15:39.161
She doesn't know she's turned it on.

15:41.801 --> 15:43.801
And then...

15:45.601 --> 15:47.601
You see this van?

15:55.121 --> 15:59.001
"Pro...Pro Nettoyage".

15:59.161 --> 16:00.241
- "Nettoyage".
- Nettoyage.

16:00.401 --> 16:01.561
Yeah, it means cleaning.

16:01.721 --> 16:05.481
This van wasn't parked here
when your son was seen at the window.

16:05.641 --> 16:09.721
No-one on that street owned
or was ever affiliated with Pro Nettoyage.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.601
So, I thought to myself,

16:11.761 --> 16:15.841
on a quiet Sunday morning in Châlons
du Bois, who is calling for cleaners?

16:16.081 --> 16:19.441
You know how little we Frenchmen
like to work on Sunday.

16:19.601 --> 16:21.881
Which led us to this man.

16:24.801 --> 16:26.801
Karl Sieg.

16:27.161 --> 16:30.601
He was the owner of Pro Nettoyage,
until a few years ago.

16:30.761 --> 16:32.161
He's never been arrested.

16:32.321 --> 16:36.801
But he has been photographed
on several occasions...

16:36.961 --> 16:38.041
with these men.

16:38.201 --> 16:40.161
I looked at them in 2006.

16:40.321 --> 16:42.441
Perhaps I missed something then.

16:43.121 --> 16:47.041
They're members of a caid de cite
working out of Paris.

16:47.681 --> 16:48.881
Romanian mostly.

16:49.041 --> 16:52.601
And this Karl Sieg,
is he involved in trafficking?

16:53.201 --> 16:54.681
We don't know for sure.

16:54.841 --> 16:59.281
But a man with his connections, parked
outside the house where your son was kept,

16:59.441 --> 17:00.601
we need to speak with him.

17:00.761 --> 17:03.561
- Where is he?
- We don't know yet.

17:03.721 --> 17:08.241
But...l have an idea how we can find out.

17:14.441 --> 17:17.441
James said he was going to call for a lift.
He should've called by now.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.601
You were saying? About the meeting.

17:21.201 --> 17:23.721
There were maybe 15 people
in this big, ugly room.

17:23.881 --> 17:26.241
Half weren't even listening
to what Julien was saying.

17:26.401 --> 17:28.401
Did you speak to him?

17:28.681 --> 17:29.841
Detective Baptiste?

17:30.001 --> 17:31.481
No. There wasn't much point.

17:31.641 --> 17:37.041
I spoke with Laurence, and she thinks that
Georges only re-opened the case as a favour.

17:37.201 --> 17:39.761
They don't have anything concrete.
It's as simple as that.

17:39.921 --> 17:41.521
It must've been hard, though.

17:41.681 --> 17:43.681
You know, going back.

17:45.921 --> 17:49.121
Yeah. But I had to find out.

17:49.281 --> 17:53.321
I had to find out if it was real or if it was
just going to be like 2009 all over again.

17:55.121 --> 17:58.041
- Tony has a way of pulling you back in...
- It's over.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.161
Anyway...

18:01.441 --> 18:02.841
Anyway, that's not why we're here.

18:03.001 --> 18:05.001
Hey...

18:05.841 --> 18:09.441
Congratulations on your promotion,
DCI Walsh.

18:21.001 --> 18:22.241
(Clock chimes)

18:26.601 --> 18:28.601
I'm sorry to leave like this.

18:28.961 --> 18:30.961
Oh, don't be silly.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.281
You came here to work.

18:33.561 --> 18:37.241
I shouldn't have followed you.
I just didn't know what else to do.

18:39.801 --> 18:41.601
Hiding from our own daughter.

18:41.761 --> 18:44.881
Christ, Julien, is that what it's come to?

18:47.801 --> 18:51.721
I mean, she could get money from anywhere,
couldn't she? If she had to.

18:52.601 --> 18:54.601
But she still comes home.

18:55.441 --> 19:00.161
Like there's a part of her
that still wants some kind of...connection.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.481
And here I am.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.641
Hiding from her.

19:05.881 --> 19:07.881
Please... (Speaks in French)

19:11.081 --> 19:14.441
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

19:24.881 --> 19:26.801
So do you think she'll be able to help?

19:26.961 --> 19:29.281
I don't know. It's been a long time.

19:30.521 --> 19:32.521
And whether she'll even agree to...

19:33.841 --> 19:35.761
So we could be going all this way for nothing?

19:35.921 --> 19:41.321
It is better that we speak in person. And safer.
I only hope it's the right decision.

19:43.161 --> 19:45.481
We're doing what we have to
to find my son.

19:47.041 --> 19:48.601
I know.

19:48.761 --> 19:55.001
But all too often, for the right reasons...
we can make the gravest of mistakes.

19:59.761 --> 20:01.761
(Exchange in French)

20:06.961 --> 20:08.641
He is not there, he's not in hospital.

20:08.801 --> 20:10.201
He is dead. We told you already.

20:10.361 --> 20:12.201
He was murdered last night.

20:12.361 --> 20:16.561
He was working undercover
investigating the gang your brother works for.

20:21.641 --> 20:23.641
What are you looking for?

20:24.121 --> 20:25.681
(Replies in French)

20:25.841 --> 20:27.161
Rini.

20:27.641 --> 20:33.361
Rini. We need to know if Leon told you
anything about why he was meeting me.

20:40.081 --> 20:42.081
<i>OK. OK.</i>

20:43.201 --> 20:45.401
Help me and I'll help you.

20:46.561 --> 20:49.801
Fix me up and I'll tell you what I know.

20:53.761 --> 20:56.921
Fair enough. It's a deal.

20:57.321 --> 20:59.321
Julien?

21:27.041 --> 21:29.041
This is harassment.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.521
Call the police.

21:36.081 --> 21:39.641
Back at your apartment,
when you knew someone had broken in,

21:39.801 --> 21:41.441
you said something:

21:41.601 --> 21:45.121
"Je ne dirai rien."
"I won't say anything." What did you mean?

21:45.361 --> 21:46.441
- Nothing.
- What?

21:46.601 --> 21:49.041
Nothing. Nothing. <i>I...</i>

21:50.841 --> 21:52.921
I was scared for my life.

21:54.001 --> 21:57.921
I meant I wouldn't say anything to the police
if the intruder would just leave me alone.

21:58.081 --> 21:59.921
No. You know something.

22:03.601 --> 22:05.601
I'm going to find out what it is.

22:07.521 --> 22:11.201
Believe me, Mr Hughes,
if I knew where your son was, I would tell you.

22:12.561 --> 22:15.121
It would be some kind of atonement.

22:16.161 --> 22:18.961
You're guilty, I know it.

22:20.721 --> 22:22.281
Guilty?

22:22.961 --> 22:26.201
I've felt guilt all of my life.

22:29.281 --> 22:33.041
Someone once told me
his father said to him on his deathbed,

22:33.201 --> 22:38.041
that..."Guilt, it's like a cancer.

22:39.121 --> 22:44.361
You can treat the symptoms
but never the cause."

23:02.001 --> 23:06.961
RINI: You can't do this!
- (Speaks French)

23:07.121 --> 23:09.121
(Knocking)

23:10.161 --> 23:11.801
RINI: I'll jump.

23:11.961 --> 23:13.961
I'll jump out of the window!

23:14.641 --> 23:16.841
- Do you hear?
- We are on the 12th floor.

23:19.321 --> 23:20.881
- What kind of cop are you?
- (Knocking)

23:21.041 --> 23:23.361
What kind of cop are you?!

23:24.081 --> 23:26.241
(Knocking intensifies)

23:28.721 --> 23:30.721
(Rini mutters and shouts)

23:33.401 --> 23:35.401
(Thudding)

23:40.121 --> 23:44.081
RINI: If you want, I can pleasure you.

23:44.241 --> 23:46.241
Would you like that?

23:48.841 --> 23:50.841
I remember.

23:52.761 --> 23:54.761
Or lollipops.

23:58.681 --> 24:00.681
I love you too.

24:30.521 --> 24:32.401
(Rini sobbing)

24:42.161 --> 24:44.161
(Voices outside)

25:20.801 --> 25:22.801
(Voices outside continue)

25:27.201 --> 25:29.201
(Knock at door)

25:31.921 --> 25:33.921
Hey, love.

25:35.361 --> 25:37.361
I just came to see how you're doing.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.041
I'm fine.

25:45.241 --> 25:47.241
Really.

25:55.561 --> 25:57.761
I was thinking, um...

26:01.201 --> 26:03.521
...maybe it's time
that you and Dad went home.

26:07.561 --> 26:09.961
I know you're still angry with him,
but we want to stay.

26:10.121 --> 26:12.081
- He is our grandson.
- I know.

26:12.241 --> 26:14.441
But me and Tony,
we have to deal with this on our own.

26:14.601 --> 26:17.241
We have to find our own way.

26:22.801 --> 26:24.801
If that's what you want.

26:29.201 --> 26:31.121
But if you need us, you call us.

26:31.281 --> 26:32.281
- OK?
- OK.

26:32.441 --> 26:33.841
<i>'</i> OK?
" Yes!

26:34.001 --> 26:36.561
<i>OK. OK.</i>

27:56.441 --> 27:57.641
Chris, hi.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.841
<i>Emily, I'm worried about Mark.</i>

28:01.721 --> 28:04.601
<i>I'm hoping you can talk him
out of handing in his notice.</i>

28:59.641 --> 29:02.881
Rini, if I had any other choice,
I wouldn't be here.

29:03.521 --> 29:06.161
You don't have to apologise, Julien.

29:07.281 --> 29:08.721
Ever.

29:09.401 --> 29:10.801
Merci.

29:16.201 --> 29:20.161
We are looking for a man called Karl Sieg.

29:22.521 --> 29:23.721
That's him.

29:29.121 --> 29:31.841
He is heavily connected
to the caids des cites.

29:32.881 --> 29:35.841
The same group Leon was part of.

29:39.241 --> 29:41.241
Do you know this man?

29:55.441 --> 29:57.001
<i>No.</i>

29:57.161 --> 29:59.161
I'm sorry.

30:00.521 --> 30:02.521
Perhaps you know someone who does?

30:11.801 --> 30:13.801
I've built a life here.

30:15.641 --> 30:17.521
I am Noelle Deschamps now.

30:18.401 --> 30:19.881
I understand.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.161
One call is all I ask.

30:21.321 --> 30:24.001
As if I had the phone numbers
of these people.

30:25.641 --> 30:28.641
To help you, I must go to Paris.

30:28.801 --> 30:30.761
And to do so, I risk everything.

30:31.601 --> 30:33.521
I will keep you safe.

30:35.361 --> 30:37.361
Don't say that.

30:39.481 --> 30:41.481
How can you say that to me?

30:45.961 --> 30:47.961
Please.

31:02.201 --> 31:04.801
I thought you never wanted
to keep things from me.

31:08.041 --> 31:09.721
I'm guessing you've spoken to Chris.

31:09.881 --> 31:12.441
Why would you lie about getting promoted?

31:12.601 --> 31:14.681
You turned up wanting to celebrate and...

31:15.241 --> 31:17.241
I didn't know how to tell you.

31:17.401 --> 31:20.281
So you lied.
And then you handed in your notice?

31:20.841 --> 31:23.121
Isn't that something
that we should talk about?

31:23.281 --> 31:25.721
My job is not something we talk about.

31:25.881 --> 31:27.881
What does that mean?

31:29.801 --> 31:31.761
I tried.

31:31.921 --> 31:33.921
In the beginning, I tried.

31:38.281 --> 31:39.961
There was this homicide.

31:40.121 --> 31:43.281
I was telling you about the crime scene
and the knife wounds

31:43.441 --> 31:45.161
and you started to cry, about Oliver.

31:45.841 --> 31:47.681
Understandably.

31:47.841 --> 31:51.601
Wondering whether he'd suffered like that,
whether that happened to him.

31:52.761 --> 31:58.441
And I realised that everything I deal with
every day just fuels your nightmares.

31:59.801 --> 32:01.801
So I shut up.

32:02.641 --> 32:04.641
Right. And that's why you quit?

32:04.841 --> 32:08.201
No. I'm quitting
because I don't have a career any more.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.201
Because I got together with Emily Hughes.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.561
I'm the man who swooped down on a victim.

32:14.401 --> 32:18.681
I gave up my career for you, my choice,
but you never even noticed.

32:18.881 --> 32:20.761
Well, why marry me, then?

32:32.681 --> 32:36.921
You know that journalist, Malik Suri,
he said something to me, a long time ago.

32:39.681 --> 32:43.641
He said the day that Oliver went missing
was the worst day of your life

32:43.801 --> 32:45.801
and the best day of his.

32:46.761 --> 32:51.241
And I think in some messed up way,
maybe that's the same for me.

32:53.881 --> 32:55.881
Cos it's the day I met you.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.121
So what do we do now?

33:04.281 --> 33:06.081
Back to square one, I suppose.

33:06.241 --> 33:08.241
No, no.

33:08.641 --> 33:10.601
We must simply explore other roads.

33:11.681 --> 33:15.841
It may take some time,
but no longer than it has already.

33:21.721 --> 33:26.841
It is quite a thing to find these days somewhere
like this place, unchanged in eight years.

33:27.361 --> 33:31.921
The same furniture, the same walls, the same
people telling the same stories no doubt.

33:35.841 --> 33:40.641
And yet, in that time,
Rini has changed her entire life.

33:46.601 --> 33:48.601
What about you?

33:49.241 --> 33:51.241
Since you were last here.

33:52.001 --> 33:54.001
Have you changed?

33:54.241 --> 33:55.961
Bien sûr!

33:56.121 --> 34:01.241
10 years ago my life was chasing demons
across the country, herding them into prison.

34:01.401 --> 34:02.641
And now...

34:02.801 --> 34:06.201
Nowadays, I spend my time
herding bees in my hive.

34:09.161 --> 34:10.641
You keep bees?

34:10.801 --> 34:12.161
Yeah.

34:12.321 --> 34:15.001
My wife thought it important I find a hobby.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.761
It has become perhaps more than that.

34:23.440 --> 34:27.400
You, I think, like me,
have the need for an obsession.

34:29.121 --> 34:31.641
And this obsession has become your life.

34:35.241 --> 34:37.241
I've given up a lot.

34:38.521 --> 34:40.521
But I don't regret any of it.

34:41.201 --> 34:43.201
Really?

34:46.521 --> 34:49.561
You are so sure there is nothing you've done
that you regret?

34:55.521 --> 34:58.001
What exactly do you think I've done, Julien?

35:04.281 --> 35:05.881
It's late.

35:06.041 --> 35:08.041
We should sleep.

35:11.521 --> 35:13.521
<i>Bonne nuit</i>

35:19.361 --> 35:21.361
(Woman shouting at child)

36:23.881 --> 36:26.601
<i>DOCTOR". How have you been feeling?
BOURG: Good.</i>

36:26.921 --> 36:28.921
<i>Great.</i>

36:29.081 --> 36:31.081
<i>I can feel the difference already.</i>

36:32.641 --> 36:39.601
<i>Just to know I have this chance to rid myself
from this darkness.</i>

36:44.801 --> 36:47.361
I feel new, you know?

36:50.361 --> 36:52.081
Every day I do the same thing.

36:52.241 --> 36:54.241
- Hold still.
- Ow.

36:56.041 --> 37:00.201
I eat the same thing, at the same time,
at the same table.

37:01.281 --> 37:05.401
This morning I sat on my couch
and I ate ice-cream.

37:08.081 --> 37:10.081
Press.

37:13.121 --> 37:19.361
You know, these routines I have,
these tracks my life has run on,

37:19.721 --> 37:21.721
they can be changed.

37:22.401 --> 37:24.401
I can make new tracks.

37:24.681 --> 37:26.681
Right?

37:28.561 --> 37:34.841
There are things in my life,
things in my past, they are unresolved.

37:35.801 --> 37:37.801
They need to be attended.

37:40.961 --> 37:42.961
I am going to see an old friend.

37:45.961 --> 37:47.521
And then my journey can truly begin.

37:47.681 --> 37:49.681
Same time next week, Mr Bourg.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.201
(Water runs)

38:03.241 --> 38:06.361
(Exchange in French)

39:16.881 --> 39:18.881
Thank you.

39:19.401 --> 39:21.481
May I ask what changed your mind?

39:23.601 --> 39:25.601
Lunch.

40:09.521 --> 40:11.961
- Chicken broth.
- (Groans)

40:12.121 --> 40:14.121
it will settle your stomach.

40:15.121 --> 40:17.121
Or strawberry flavour.

40:18.361 --> 40:19.361
Lollipop.

40:19.521 --> 40:22.761
Sometimes a hit of sugar will do the job.

40:36.321 --> 40:38.041
(Sighs with relief)

40:40.721 --> 40:42.681
You know?

40:42.841 --> 40:44.601
You have experience?

40:46.441 --> 40:48.441
My daughter.

40:49.921 --> 40:52.921
I have been through this more times
than I care to remember.

40:59.681 --> 41:01.681
Mark Twain.

41:06.001 --> 41:08.001
You can borrow it.

41:08.761 --> 41:10.761
I finished it last night.

41:12.601 --> 41:14.841
You read this in one night?

41:15.841 --> 41:17.841
- All?
- Yeah.

41:21.241 --> 41:23.841
I didn't read a book since high school.

41:24.201 --> 41:26.201
Please. Take it.

41:29.241 --> 41:31.241
It's one of life's great pleasures.

41:40.201 --> 41:42.201
(Sobs)

41:49.521 --> 41:50.681
(She groans)

41:57.761 --> 42:00.761
- He was policeman?
- Yes.

42:00.921 --> 42:02.921
True policeman?

42:03.841 --> 42:06.481
You know the gang he was investigating.

42:07.161 --> 42:09.161
And what they're capable of.

42:11.161 --> 42:13.481
The same gang your brother works for.

42:17.881 --> 42:19.881
What do you want?

42:21.001 --> 42:23.001
Huh?

42:24.121 --> 42:26.721
What do you want?

42:30.681 --> 42:32.681
I need from you information.

42:38.801 --> 42:40.801
I am many things.

42:41.401 --> 42:43.401
But I am not a rat.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.801
You can go if you like.

42:53.121 --> 42:55.201
- You are not a prisoner.
- (Mutters)

42:56.721 --> 43:00.361
But if you walk out that door,
you are on your own.

43:01.521 --> 43:03.161
And I would watch your back.

43:03.321 --> 43:07.161
Because these men will come looking for you
now they know your boyfriend was a cop.

43:10.841 --> 43:15.081
Just tell me what you know
and I will help you with your rehabilitation,

43:15.241 --> 43:18.841
relocate you, give you a new name, a job...

43:19.121 --> 43:21.121
They will never find you.

43:21.281 --> 43:23.641
I'll make sure that you are safe.

43:36.481 --> 43:38.481
That soup.

43:44.281 --> 43:45.841
Is it still warm?

43:48.081 --> 43:50.081
Yes.

44:14.921 --> 44:16.801
It's good.

44:18.241 --> 44:22.561
(Shouting in French)

44:37.561 --> 44:39.561
(Music from car stereo)

45:06.921 --> 45:08.921
(Text alert)

45:22.361 --> 45:24.361
(Music continues)

46:17.481 --> 46:19.201
Ian, it's Tony.

46:19.361 --> 46:21.521
<i>Tony, come in, second floor.</i>

46:23.041 --> 46:25.041
(Door buzzer)

46:31.801 --> 46:33.561
Hello?

46:33.721 --> 46:35.121
Good afternoon.

46:35.281 --> 46:38.521
- I wasn't expecting company.
- I'm sorry for barging in.

46:38.681 --> 46:41.041
No bother. You're always welcome.

46:41.321 --> 46:44.281
Beer in the afternoon always gets my vote.

46:46.801 --> 46:48.601
This is...this is great.

46:49.561 --> 46:50.641
Well, I bought this place

46:50.801 --> 46:54.841
because I wanted somewhere near the office
I could stay when I'm over.

46:55.001 --> 46:58.081
Only temporary,
while my own place is being built.

46:58.721 --> 47:00.401
- What, here in Lille?
- No, no.

47:00.561 --> 47:02.881
A beautiful wee place called Audresselles.

47:03.041 --> 47:05.041
By the coast.

47:05.401 --> 47:07.401
Somewhere where the wife can join.

47:08.441 --> 47:10.041
She won't come here.

47:10.201 --> 47:13.241
She calls this place the "Gentleman's club".
(Laughs)

47:13.401 --> 47:15.401
She does!

47:18.841 --> 47:20.841
Thanks.

47:21.801 --> 47:23.801
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

47:29.001 --> 47:31.881
Look, Ian, you know you said
you know Georges Deloix?

47:32.481 --> 47:36.521
Aye, the juge d'instruction.
Yeah, he's a friend.

47:36.681 --> 47:40.641
I was wondering, could you have a word
with him about Vincent Bourg?

47:44.161 --> 47:47.201
- Tony, we've been down this road.
- No, I know, I know.

47:47.361 --> 47:52.561
But when I was in Bourg's flat I overheard him
say something. And it doesn't add up.

47:52.761 --> 47:54.001
He's hiding something.

47:54.161 --> 47:57.161
Please, just ask Georges
to take another look at him.

47:59.041 --> 48:00.721
<i>OK.</i>

48:01.521 --> 48:02.801
Thank you. I appreciate it.

48:02.961 --> 48:04.961
(Phone rings)

48:10.201 --> 48:12.001
Yes, now fire away.

48:13.001 --> 48:14.681
Mm-hm.

48:14.841 --> 48:17.841
You mean you want to do that...
you want to start all over again?

48:18.881 --> 48:20.241
Mm-hm.

48:20.521 --> 48:22.721
(Ian continues talking in background)

48:53.361 --> 48:54.601
I painted that myself.

48:56.881 --> 48:58.721
From memory.

48:58.881 --> 49:00.881
It's your daughter?

49:01.721 --> 49:03.721
Was.

49:04.841 --> 49:10.401
I paint one of those every year
to remind myself what she was like.

49:12.041 --> 49:15.001
Her spirit, or whatever you want to call it.

49:17.721 --> 49:22.921
Something about painting my Molly,
getting her eyes just right,

49:25.361 --> 49:31.281
something that looking at photos
can never do.

49:33.601 --> 49:35.601
What happened to her?

49:39.321 --> 49:45.121
I went to bed one night and woke up

49:45.281 --> 49:47.521
and she was gone.

49:47.681 --> 49:49.201
No...

49:51.241 --> 49:55.761
Police said she'd wandered out.

49:57.601 --> 50:00.961
No sign of a break-in, no blood.

50:01.121 --> 50:03.121
No nothing.

50:04.161 --> 50:08.721
The official description was...
she had run away,

50:12.121 --> 50:14.121
but I know that isn't true.

50:16.761 --> 50:18.281
We were very happy-

50:22.121 --> 50:24.121
Oh, Ian, I'm sorry.

50:24.801 --> 50:29.481
Maybe I didn't lock the door or the window...

50:30.721 --> 50:32.721
I didn't I hear anything...

50:32.881 --> 50:34.881
I was in the same house, dammit.

50:37.041 --> 50:40.121
We're not all that dissimilar,
you and me, Tony.

50:42.041 --> 50:44.201
Carrying around all that guilt...

50:47.161 --> 50:49.681
...for something that's out of our control.

50:53.121 --> 50:57.881
I remember advice my old man gave me.

50:59.561 --> 51:01.561
He'd made some mistakes.

51:02.761 --> 51:04.201
Other women, you know?

51:06.281 --> 51:12.001
Later on, on his deathbed,
he told me he regretted it.

51:13.441 --> 51:16.481
And he said that guilt was like a cancer.

51:17.521 --> 51:21.761
You can treat the symptom
but never the cause.

51:33.961 --> 51:36.321
Um,

51:36.481 --> 51:38.561
I should get going, Ian.

51:42.041 --> 51:44.561
Yeah. You go.

51:45.561 --> 51:47.561
Go be with your wife.

51:49.561 --> 51:51.561
You'll be all right, chum.

52:24.561 --> 52:26.641
- Bonjour?
- (Man replies in French)

52:31.601 --> 52:34.361
Le voiture de...Hughes.

52:38.121 --> 52:40.441
Of course. One moment.

53:04.721 --> 53:06.161
It is right?

53:06.321 --> 53:08.321
Thank you.

53:14.081 --> 53:15.881
What happened?

53:16.481 --> 53:18.481
Excusez-moi?

53:19.161 --> 53:22.681
(Speaks in French)

53:23.721 --> 53:25.921
The battery, it failed.

53:26.081 --> 53:28.081
- The battery?
- Yes.

53:30.641 --> 53:34.801
(Speaks in French)

53:36.201 --> 53:38.201
I don't understand.

53:39.441 --> 53:41.441
Just bad luck.

53:59.521 --> 54:02.201
- Where've you been?
- I went to collect the car.

54:05.041 --> 54:08.281
<i>I...</i> I found <i>this.</i>

54:43.281 --> 54:45.281
Look, Em.

54:46.721 --> 54:51.001
The police, I think they've missed something.

54:52.121 --> 54:54.161
I found some things out
about Vincent Bourg.

54:54.321 --> 54:56.641
He knows Ian Garrett.
The two of them know each other.

54:56.801 --> 55:00.121
- What?
- So the only suspect in this whole thing

55:00.281 --> 55:03.961
has a link with someone who turns up
out of the blue and starts throwing money at us.

55:04.121 --> 55:05.521
I mean, what does that mean?

55:05.681 --> 55:08.601
Ian Garrett? Tony, I think we should just think...

55:08.761 --> 55:10.561
- Please, listen.
- Just wait, stop.

55:10.721 --> 55:12.721
I need you to believe me. Please. Em.

55:16.521 --> 55:19.121
Believe me, they know each other.

55:20.321 --> 55:25.121
Em, if we keep shutting each other out,

55:27.441 --> 55:29.441
we're going to lose each other.

55:30.241 --> 55:34.521
And if that happens...what else is there?

55:36.481 --> 55:38.481
They know each other.

55:46.761 --> 55:48.761
I believe you.

55:50.801 --> 55:52.801
I do.

55:54.161 --> 55:56.161
I do. I do.

56:32.641 --> 56:34.641
(Man speaks quietly in French)

56:43.241 --> 56:45.001
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

56:45.161 --> 56:47.001
Ian Garrett... (Speaks in French)

56:49.081 --> 56:51.081
(Continues in French)

56:51.721 --> 56:54.281
Hi. Parlez-vous I'anglais?

56:55.881 --> 56:57.401
Yes.

56:57.561 --> 56:59.681
Did I hear you say
you're looking for Ian Garrett?

56:59.841 --> 57:01.521
Yes.

57:01.681 --> 57:03.641
This is his company, right?

57:03.801 --> 57:05.441
His French office?

57:05.601 --> 57:09.801
Yes, yes,
but, sorry, how do you know Mr Garrett?

57:12.121 --> 57:14.121
He's an old acquaintance.

57:15.201 --> 57:17.161
Well, he's not here now. He's...

57:18.601 --> 57:20.601
Did you not hear?

57:21.281 --> 57:23.041
Hear what?

57:23.201 --> 57:24.881
He went missing.

57:25.041 --> 57:26.481
Eight years ago.

57:26.641 --> 57:29.241
He was finally declared dead
end of last year.

57:29.841 --> 57:31.841
How did you not know?

57:35.601 --> 57:37.761
I was away.

57:37.921 --> 57:39.201
In the UK.

57:39.361 --> 57:42.761
Well, I'm...I'm very sorry. I really am.

57:47.441 --> 57:49.441
<i>No.</i>

57:50.361 --> 57:52.161
No, no.

57:52.321 --> 57:54.321
It's no bother.

57:55.961 --> 57:57.961
Thank you.

57:58.441 --> 57:59.961
Merci.

58:00.121 --> 58:02.121
<i>- Au revoir.
WOMAN". Au revoir.</i>
