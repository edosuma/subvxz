WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:02.928
Dr Priestley did name a suspect he
considers a Spanish spy.

00:03.008 --> 00:05.359
Secretary Farlow,
the same man who so hastily

00:05.383 --> 00:07.484
boarded a ship to Bermuda
as if he'd ran away.

00:07.539 --> 00:09.779
You must show Massinger that you are
master here

00:09.859 --> 00:11.490
by taking a share of the
sheriff's profits.

00:11.551 --> 00:13.466
I thought you were friends
with the sheriff, Jocelyn?

00:13.522 --> 00:15.123
Tell the governor I'll do as he asks.

00:15.169 --> 00:17.458
I'll bait Chacrow
into betraying his own people.

00:17.505 --> 00:19.458
I've seen my brother plotting
with the marshal.

00:19.505 --> 00:22.554
- I'm married to a traitor.
- Silas?

00:22.609 --> 00:24.687
It was me that told Chacrow.

00:25.109 --> 00:27.349
Don't ask me why I told the truth,

00:27.429 --> 00:29.935
ask yourself why you turned traitor

00:30.005 --> 00:32.037
to people who saved your life.

00:32.115 --> 00:35.256
- Promise you will not love me.
- There is no need for such a promise.

00:35.327 --> 00:38.651
Master Read witnessed me going to
visit Christopher after dark.

00:38.714 --> 00:41.659
So, why are you so convinced that
Christopher is a Spanish spy?

00:41.722 --> 00:43.964
Because he is a highly regarded
apothecary.

00:44.018 --> 00:45.751
So why does he come here

00:45.790 --> 00:49.198
at exactly the same time
as the Spanish covet our colony?

01:39.795 --> 01:41.255
Thomas.

01:41.842 --> 01:43.451
Meet Simeon Peck.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.769
Marvellous fellow.

01:44.858 --> 01:47.050
We became acquainted in Bermuda.

01:56.537 --> 02:00.600
Did ever I see such a bright blaze
of a capotain hat?

02:07.674 --> 02:09.842
Who might wear such a delight?

02:09.967 --> 02:14.241
It ain't for me, sir, it's for my
mistress, Widow Castell.

02:14.295 --> 02:17.834
Nicholas, why have you brought
such a bauble back to Jamestown?

02:17.914 --> 02:19.924
Thomas must accommodate Simeon

02:19.986 --> 02:23.174
at all costs, he will prove
most beneficial to us.

02:23.228 --> 02:24.603
I witnessed what happened to you

02:24.642 --> 02:26.978
when you accommodated
your two young favourites in London,

02:27.034 --> 02:28.554
debts and ridicule.

02:28.906 --> 02:32.194
This will be different. I promise you.

02:37.394 --> 02:39.495
Ma'am, I never been so muddled.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.902
The secretary smiled at me.

02:41.949 --> 02:45.154
- Secretary Farlow has returned?
- Yes, ma'am.

02:45.234 --> 02:47.463
And he has the most
comely gentleman with him

02:47.510 --> 02:49.861
and he complemented your hat.

02:50.799 --> 02:53.194
A comely gentleman?

02:53.274 --> 02:54.561
Master Sharrow,

02:54.631 --> 02:57.420
have you seen Secretary Farlow
this morning with another gentleman?

02:57.780 --> 03:00.389
I do believe they
went to the apothecary, ma'am.

03:02.954 --> 03:04.614
The secretary is hardly off the ship

03:04.638 --> 03:07.638
with his companion and
Widow Castell is chasing after him.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.234
If ever a woman so meddle in the
matters of men?

03:10.821 --> 03:12.749
Don't you know how to bring a man hell?

03:12.835 --> 03:14.772
Whatever falsehood
that widow has upon her,

03:14.796 --> 03:16.796
she ain't a traitor to her own people.

03:19.914 --> 03:24.118
What is it you believe that you know
about me, James Read?

03:25.123 --> 03:26.533
Only this,

03:26.987 --> 03:30.354
it's not just you that will pay.
Your wife will.

03:42.215 --> 03:43.934
Dr Priestley,

03:44.317 --> 03:46.648
my companion is a man of science,

03:46.695 --> 03:49.034
he wishes to avail of your apothecary.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.492
Doctor.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.156
Might you have an aludel
for condensing vapours,

03:54.794 --> 03:58.022
a Moreshead still,
an alembic and a retort?

03:58.124 --> 03:59.964
I have all of those, sir.

04:00.045 --> 04:03.754
I will require also oil of vitriol,
vitriol romano, litharge,

04:03.834 --> 04:06.394
milk of sulphur, plumbago, salammoniac...

04:06.457 --> 04:07.981
And doubtless more ingredients

04:08.005 --> 04:10.496
which you yourself will provide, sir.

04:11.366 --> 04:12.453
Widow Castell,

04:12.517 --> 04:15.101
we are conducting a delicate business
with Dr Priestley.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.456
Excuse the intrusion.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.503
I dearly wish to welcome
our intriguing visitor.

04:19.553 --> 04:22.154
Simeon Peck, madam.

04:24.834 --> 04:27.714
Oh, but now I can see why such a
dazzling hat was required.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.269
It must mean, sweet madam,

04:29.293 --> 04:32.839
that we might exchange compliments
and ply the art of vanity.

04:32.863 --> 04:33.908
(SHE LAUGHS)

04:33.909 --> 04:38.510
We will return to conclude our
employment another day, Dr Priestley.

04:46.346 --> 04:48.971
Christopher, why do you not ask what
their purpose is?

04:49.234 --> 04:51.260
Because I know what they are about.

04:51.346 --> 04:52.478
Oh?

04:52.948 --> 04:54.954
Why won't you tell me, there might
be some advantage in it?

04:55.034 --> 04:58.575
No, Jocelyn. Still you seek triumph
in every encounter.

04:58.634 --> 05:00.239
With Farlow, yes.

05:00.325 --> 05:03.354
I must prove that he is the devil
who sold himself to the Spanish.

05:03.434 --> 05:05.474
We must seek out every ounce of
intelligence

05:05.554 --> 05:07.515
to see what tricks he is at.

05:07.805 --> 05:09.484
Tell me why they were here, Christopher.

05:09.508 --> 05:11.250
No.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.135
Must I lay my hopes
before you with a trowel?

05:16.565 --> 05:18.916
Will you make me plead, Jocelyn?

05:19.371 --> 05:20.876
You loved me.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.814
I saw it.

05:22.971 --> 05:24.048
I felt it.

05:24.696 --> 05:26.744
You confided to me your every hurt.

05:27.514 --> 05:29.794
I felt trusted, chosen.

05:32.354 --> 05:33.994
Desired.

05:34.407 --> 05:36.970
Now, I might as well kiss at smoke.

05:37.759 --> 05:39.978
Jocelyn, why have you vanished?

05:42.241 --> 05:44.881
- I do not know.
- Oh, but you do know.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.549
For the first time

05:52.666 --> 05:56.307
I do not delight in your sweet deceits.

06:08.114 --> 06:10.250
Temperance Yeardley told me

06:10.500 --> 06:12.437
on the day that my husband died

06:13.366 --> 06:15.943
I must remarry and quickly

06:16.545 --> 06:19.711
because a woman has no place in this
world without a man.

06:25.471 --> 06:28.594
Every instinct makes me fight
against such a confinement.

06:32.954 --> 06:34.554
That is my true devotion.

06:41.752 --> 06:43.612
Milk of sulphur,

06:44.791 --> 06:46.815
plumbago,

06:47.096 --> 06:48.987
salammoniac.

06:50.066 --> 06:51.626
(SCOFFS) Alchemy.

06:51.907 --> 06:54.165
(CHATTER)

06:56.914 --> 06:58.370
Blacksmith,

06:58.454 --> 07:01.464
we will be in need of a
goodly amount of lead from you.

07:01.964 --> 07:05.089
My process requires
an assistant skilled in metals.

07:05.113 --> 07:06.174
Will you serve me, sir?

07:06.199 --> 07:09.113
When the time is right, Read,
you will avail Master Peck.

07:09.175 --> 07:11.566
How beguiling your enterprise
sounds, sir.

07:11.629 --> 07:12.817
Go to, woman,

07:13.003 --> 07:16.425
another occasion
to seek quarrel and offence.

07:20.394 --> 07:23.064
Did they ask you for lead, Master Read?

07:23.861 --> 07:27.194
Is it true that such a base metal
can be turned into gold?

07:29.012 --> 07:32.532
Your question is fit enough but
I have another one for you.

07:33.794 --> 07:35.370
Why should I answer?

07:38.114 --> 07:39.665
Mercy told me that you witnessed

07:39.689 --> 07:43.009
my visit to Dr Priestley after dark.
I wish to explain.

07:43.056 --> 07:45.236
What need is there for you
to recount to me

07:45.305 --> 07:47.081
for what you choose to do
when the moon's out?

07:47.114 --> 07:48.554
I didn't say "need".

07:49.160 --> 07:50.816
I will not lie to you,
the matter was political.

07:50.879 --> 07:52.652
Will you marry him?

07:53.700 --> 07:55.702
You are no business of mine.

07:56.256 --> 07:57.492
I believe that Christopher will answer...

07:57.516 --> 08:01.296
No, that's a political reply.
How will you answer him?

08:01.421 --> 08:03.598
- It ain't no business of mine.
- James...

08:03.660 --> 08:05.637
Look, my true question,

08:05.708 --> 08:07.708
and it will torment me for not asking,

08:08.926 --> 08:10.968
is if you weren't a woman of standing...

08:10.992 --> 08:12.476
The answer is no, never.

08:24.399 --> 08:27.412
You know, there are some that
believe that common metal

08:27.545 --> 08:29.701
is imperfect...

08:29.935 --> 08:32.208
and corrupted, and diseased.

08:33.234 --> 08:34.787
But what's inside of it

08:34.866 --> 08:36.602
is its true nature,

08:36.743 --> 08:38.986
prima materia and the alchemist,

08:39.034 --> 08:42.313
he may discover
the process for purifying it.

08:42.799 --> 08:47.074
And to extract what is
noble and what is precious.

08:50.474 --> 08:52.954
I only ever wish to offer you comfort.

08:55.299 --> 08:57.059
I believe you...

08:57.666 --> 08:59.927
that such was your intention,

09:00.480 --> 09:02.480
but comfort was not worth tasting.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.050
Winganuske, you work so quickly.

09:18.268 --> 09:21.737
I can't keep up.
Does it not hurt your back?

09:23.917 --> 09:26.047
_

09:27.834 --> 09:29.274
Water.

09:32.079 --> 09:35.408
_

09:38.290 --> 09:40.585
James Read called me a traitor.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.554
What did you tell him?

09:43.474 --> 09:47.163
Silas, the day you disappeared,
I was in such distress, I...

09:47.749 --> 09:48.961
I did speak with James Read

09:48.992 --> 09:50.773
but I would never see
anything against you.

09:50.797 --> 09:52.797
How else would he know?

09:53.405 --> 09:55.405
Well, then I must have said that,
I don't remember.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.741
Have you no loyalty to your own husband?

09:57.842 --> 10:00.601
No, I will not be judged
for this one failing,

10:00.625 --> 10:02.444
not when you were the cause of it.

10:02.701 --> 10:04.401
He's threatened to speak out.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.823
If you wanted to harm you
he would have done so by now.

10:07.847 --> 10:09.096
Why him?

10:09.535 --> 10:11.057
Why James Read?

10:12.434 --> 10:14.434
Because he helped me.

10:17.395 --> 10:19.057
Silas...

10:25.888 --> 10:29.326
Did we not see them
on the street before us,

10:29.380 --> 10:32.974
our own secretary
and his pretty fashion mongoose?

10:32.998 --> 10:33.953
(LAUGHTER)

10:33.978 --> 10:35.655
I swear I saw them nuzzling.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.762
(LAUGHTER)

10:38.440 --> 10:41.408
It was a task to keep
me eyeballs in me head.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.233
(LAUGHTER)

10:43.234 --> 10:44.601
- Verity.
- Hey!

10:44.648 --> 10:46.633
Mind how you fleer and jest.

10:46.851 --> 10:49.834
There's fellas here who had
sweethearts and kissing companions

10:49.914 --> 10:52.326
of their own before the women arrived.

10:52.482 --> 10:53.740
Mm?

11:05.590 --> 11:07.672
And you can decipher this?

11:09.186 --> 11:12.368
That which may fashion itself
in the mirror of wisdom

11:12.790 --> 11:14.789
becomes itself in the tincture.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.017
So it is fixed and formed in magic,
and brought into being.

11:19.041 --> 11:20.787
(CHUCKLES)

11:21.146 --> 11:24.373
Sir, I was apprentice to your
harness Valentinas Andrea.

11:24.397 --> 11:25.448
Simeon.

11:25.503 --> 11:27.433
Master Peck is a man of true genius,

11:27.457 --> 11:30.723
he speaks five languages,
Latin, Russian, Arabic,

11:30.786 --> 11:32.794
he has written a
book about ancient Rome.

11:32.874 --> 11:35.594
And he knows the inside of a ladies hat.

11:35.674 --> 11:39.517
(SPEAKS LATIN)

11:39.571 --> 11:42.064
And you have seen base metal...

11:42.799 --> 11:44.134
turned to gold?

11:44.540 --> 11:46.649
I promise you, Governor,

11:46.767 --> 11:48.517
that the art of alchemy

11:48.626 --> 11:50.634
brings wondrous transformations.

11:50.704 --> 11:52.597
There's nothing but folly
and foul trickery

11:52.621 --> 11:55.596
to deceive and thieve
any who let themselves be duped.

11:55.643 --> 11:56.694
Then gentleman,

11:56.754 --> 12:00.662
I will not fritter your time and beliefs
on my enchanted arts.

12:00.718 --> 12:03.674
Wait, no. Hold, hold. Hold hard, sir.

12:05.132 --> 12:08.548
Why have you come to Virginia to
conduct your work, Master Peck?

12:09.146 --> 12:12.802
I was possessed of a dream.
It's cinnabar.

12:13.021 --> 12:16.241
The red mineral renowned
for its marvellous properties

12:16.280 --> 12:21.154
of scientific transformation might
be found here in profusion.

12:21.314 --> 12:23.373
A dream, Governor.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.521
Are we to give this man trust
and reputation

12:25.545 --> 12:28.911
- built on such smoke and offal?
- Marshal, hold your railing.

12:28.943 --> 12:32.246
Yes, you rob yourself of credibility
you're so married to bombastry.

12:33.834 --> 12:36.332
We must hold this occupation most secret.

12:36.489 --> 12:40.033
Tell none but those of us
that are here tonight.

12:40.783 --> 12:43.650
We would not wish to stir up unnecessary

12:43.822 --> 12:46.814
excitements amongst the settlers.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.049
(HUBBUB)

12:52.559 --> 12:55.581
Sir, if you are seeking the secretary

12:55.753 --> 12:58.677
he is cuddled with
the sweet apple of a friend.

12:58.724 --> 13:00.284
Just at the back there.

13:07.044 --> 13:10.300
We have a law here in Virginia

13:10.551 --> 13:13.089
passed in the year of 1610.

13:13.124 --> 13:14.514
Thomas, do not bite so.

13:14.577 --> 13:17.319
No man shall commit the horrible

13:17.475 --> 13:20.483
and detestable sin of sodomy.

13:20.897 --> 13:23.698
He that can be lawfully convicted
of such abomination

13:23.722 --> 13:25.262
and evident proof made there of...

13:25.317 --> 13:28.006
- You know this law well, Marshal.
- ...they shall be whipped.

13:28.090 --> 13:31.404
They shall beg for public
forgiveness before the congregation.

13:31.505 --> 13:34.748
Let any act of
bestial buggery be discovered.

13:34.779 --> 13:36.513
(LAUGHS)

13:42.966 --> 13:46.020
Do you find this matter so amusing,
Master Peck,

13:46.052 --> 13:48.052
that it brings you to laughter?

13:48.766 --> 13:52.177
If you do not hear
that sound, sir, I do.

13:52.482 --> 13:54.366
It is the death knell.

14:04.126 --> 14:05.944
Thomas, you must let Simeon be

14:05.968 --> 14:09.115
for the short while that we might gain
the riches he will afford us.

14:09.161 --> 14:11.123
Do you not see, I do this for you?

14:11.655 --> 14:14.049
To save you from
this dangerous intoxication.

14:14.074 --> 14:15.957
I need no such protection.

14:16.035 --> 14:17.996
I am the guardian of my own fate.

14:18.050 --> 14:19.839
He will beguile you.

14:20.168 --> 14:25.486
I see it and you will stoop and be lost.

16:04.617 --> 16:06.102
Was there some trouble

16:06.172 --> 16:08.344
between you and Pedro
just now in the field?

16:10.166 --> 16:12.570
Not trouble, ma'am.

16:12.897 --> 16:16.945
- It was fooling.
- Oh, fooling.

16:17.648 --> 16:19.618
Maria has made a pipe, ma'am.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.691
It is cut so fine it is
too good to smoke from.

16:23.754 --> 16:26.206
- Let me bring it to show the lady.
- I will fetch it.

16:30.549 --> 16:33.565
There is a growing fondness between
you and Maria, Pedro.

16:42.892 --> 16:46.221
- Who is it for?
- I made it for you, ma'am.

16:48.242 --> 16:51.462
I will treasure it. Thank you.

17:19.968 --> 17:22.311
When I spoke to you about my fears,

17:22.429 --> 17:24.592
I took you for a trusted friend.

17:24.662 --> 17:28.256
Why would you use what I told you as
a weapon against my husband?

17:28.310 --> 17:31.119
I know Silas would only
do what his heart told him was true.

17:31.541 --> 17:34.046
And I could never do anything to
bring harm to you.

17:34.126 --> 17:35.986
Then why did you make such a threat?

17:36.986 --> 17:40.643
Some twisted idea of chivalry, perhaps.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.926
There's a strange fellow.

17:44.526 --> 17:45.901
You see the book?

17:45.963 --> 17:49.494
That man asked me for lead.
He's an alchemist.

17:49.541 --> 17:51.416
Look, the secretary's got his stick,

to give the world a whack.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.933
but I can't shake it off.

18:39.971 --> 18:43.035
Didn't you have the same spell's
grip for me once?

18:47.379 --> 18:49.410
You shook that off.

18:50.152 --> 18:51.613
You can do it again.

18:53.852 --> 18:56.618
No, that... that was a man's
innocent heart.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.055
This is madness.

18:59.846 --> 19:01.305
I know it.

19:05.219 --> 19:07.779
But it seems I want to be mad.

19:24.686 --> 19:26.914
I spoke with James Read.

19:27.686 --> 19:30.133
Our business with him is finished now.

19:31.054 --> 19:33.992
If we might have an afternoon
under a tree

19:34.234 --> 19:36.234
to show you my true feelings?

The ship will come any day now

19:46.661 --> 19:49.653
with payment for our tobacco
that we sent to England.

19:50.516 --> 19:52.956
Soon we will know the best of times.

19:54.046 --> 19:56.192
This is what we worked for.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.380
I will buy you a hat.

19:59.450 --> 20:01.675
- (LAUGHS)
- Or shoes.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.421
Or any little treasure

20:04.446 --> 20:07.766
that will show you how my heart
sings when I see you.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.050
Gentlemen.

20:15.175 --> 20:17.003
Master Peck here

20:17.143 --> 20:18.846
needs to conduct some experiments.

20:18.901 --> 20:21.440
Medical explorations
for which he will require

20:21.464 --> 20:23.946
various minerals, roots and plants.

20:28.646 --> 20:31.804
Dr Priestley is the man that might
assist you best, sir.

20:31.859 --> 20:33.254
We require such specimens

20:33.278 --> 20:35.908
that might only be obtained
with the aid of the naturals.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.613
Who better to approach
them than you brothers?

20:38.652 --> 20:40.126
What is it
you're looking for, gentlemen?

20:40.962 --> 20:45.868
Master Peck would be most grateful
for a supply of puccoon, masquepen,

20:46.017 --> 20:51.756
dogwood, sassafras, cinnabar,
chickweed, potash galena.

20:51.934 --> 20:53.746
Well, we will speak with the Pamunkey,

20:53.771 --> 20:55.481
see if they might aid us.

20:55.543 --> 20:59.598
I envy you, Mistress Sharrow,
bearing a child.

20:59.676 --> 21:03.607
That mother's bliss that might bring
a babe into this world.

21:08.066 --> 21:11.834
Bring us the items,
you'll be amply rewarded. Come.

21:17.053 --> 21:20.897
James Read told me that Master Peck
has a book of alchemy.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.833
The list of items Farlow spoke of...

21:24.247 --> 21:27.129
that was a voice
with something to hide in it.

21:27.450 --> 21:31.148
Do you think perhaps they only want
one thing? Cinnabar.

21:31.312 --> 21:34.422
I saw it on Master Peck's face as
the secretary spoke.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.297
If they want to make gold,

21:36.594 --> 21:38.594
then why should we help them do that?

21:39.984 --> 21:42.623
Let them believe
their dung-brained wonders

21:42.818 --> 21:44.818
if they're going to pay us well.

21:46.524 --> 21:48.284

21:50.953 --> 21:52.421
Our fight...

21:53.209 --> 21:55.209
was necessary.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.380
It was all the anger I've ever felt.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.514
But it's done now.

22:01.584 --> 22:03.764
I still respect you
as the older brother.

22:04.701 --> 22:08.144
No, that is not how it is.

22:10.316 --> 22:13.198
We both know now
which of us can kill the other.

22:13.878 --> 22:15.878
And that determines everything.

22:17.284 --> 22:19.305
I will serve you.

22:19.551 --> 22:21.485
I will oblige you.

22:29.107 --> 22:31.867
Till the time comes when it might
turn again.

22:48.543 --> 22:50.503
Mercy, come. Come here.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.355
- Ma'am, are we spying?
- Hush, child.

22:58.863 --> 23:01.519
Ma'am, I ain't ever spied
on no one before.

23:01.941 --> 23:03.777
And why are we spying?

23:04.317 --> 23:07.162
You are to look and to see,
and to witness.

23:07.264 --> 23:09.154
So that you might testify.

23:30.842 --> 23:35.063
Ah, Nicholas Farlow, you look so
splendid lying there.

23:35.133 --> 23:36.730
(CHUCKLES)

23:38.918 --> 23:41.038
I delight in every part of you.

23:48.029 --> 23:51.560
And I delight in you, dear Simeon.

24:12.827 --> 24:17.344
The urge's forbidden... by law.

24:17.593 --> 24:19.345
No one would need ever know.

24:21.071 --> 24:22.452
I will know.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.924
Nicholas.

24:25.877 --> 24:29.283
I have seen how your eyes devour me

24:29.615 --> 24:32.935
when you think
I'm not aware you are looking.

24:34.203 --> 24:38.294
I know the looks of men when they
admire me.

24:38.992 --> 24:40.899
When they desire me.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.430
But you love me.

24:46.851 --> 24:48.467
Will you deny it?

24:50.126 --> 24:52.327
'Tis forbidden.

24:52.660 --> 24:55.940
- Did you not hear the marshal say it?
- The marshal's not here.

24:57.466 --> 24:59.426
I want to surprise you.

25:05.828 --> 25:07.748
I dare do not.

25:07.949 --> 25:09.942
But we might hold one another

25:10.239 --> 25:14.235
in all tenderness
and sweet shameless intimacy.

Company Of Virginia.

25:33.952 --> 25:38.620
I will not be destroyed by mere emotion.

25:40.697 --> 25:44.297
Can I pity you, your paltry heart?

25:49.385 --> 25:51.385
(SOBBING)

25:55.875 --> 25:58.464
We are not done, Nicholas.

25:59.042 --> 26:02.162
I will love you and you will love me.

26:03.528 --> 26:06.888
I will show you what is possible
between two souls.

26:32.784 --> 26:35.598
Ma'am, what is a paltry heart?

26:36.791 --> 26:39.885
- And do I have a paltry heart?
- Hush, child.

26:48.678 --> 26:50.595
I trust no one has distressed you?

26:50.650 --> 26:53.384
I must prove Farlow
to be the Spanish spy here.

26:53.518 --> 26:55.743
I cannot stop
until he's caught and tried.

26:55.774 --> 26:57.212
Why do you insist on saying you must,

26:57.251 --> 26:59.477
why should the responsibility of evidence
fall onto your shoulders?

26:59.501 --> 27:01.602
I must. Do you hear me?

27:01.638 --> 27:04.194
Then tell me why, or I will never again
believe a word you say

27:04.234 --> 27:05.710
or even a look on your face.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.687
You have no cause
other than your hatred of Farlow.

27:08.718 --> 27:10.797
Because the governor believes it
is you who is this spy.

27:11.367 --> 27:12.625
(SCOFFS)

27:12.650 --> 27:13.804
Well, what would make him
believe such a thing?

27:13.828 --> 27:15.648
I told him it was so.

27:22.209 --> 27:24.475
I thought I could forgive you
anything, Jocelyn.

27:24.499 --> 27:26.616
- Christopher...
- Stay away from me.

27:27.452 --> 27:28.717
Please.

27:29.405 --> 27:31.318
Stay away from me.

27:32.541 --> 27:34.981

one more moment.

Henry's sorry, Chacrow.

27:52.827 --> 27:55.293
He made a mistake and he will repay you

27:55.339 --> 27:56.605
to win back your respect.

27:56.652 --> 28:00.918
Not so long ago,
Henry Sharrow spoke for himself.

28:03.646 --> 28:05.646
with fierce bravery.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.979
I was never afraid.

28:14.587 --> 28:16.114
Now...

28:17.005 --> 28:19.005
I must be watchful.

28:33.049 --> 28:34.678
He ain't done with you yet, brother.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.952
The Pamunkey caught you once,

28:39.210 --> 28:40.850
they'll come after you again.

28:43.318 --> 28:45.638
I won't betray myself a second time.

29:16.576 --> 29:20.890
Did you have yourself a hairy
sweetheart? A kissing companion?

29:22.546 --> 29:24.546
I can't be certain.

29:27.459 --> 29:29.308
Maria. Maria.

29:29.385 --> 29:31.940
I've never seen you
in the settlement after dark.

29:31.996 --> 29:33.269
Let me show you.

29:34.479 --> 29:36.307
Come on.

29:42.993 --> 29:44.433
Where did you get this?

29:44.507 --> 29:46.679
Someone placed it in our shack

29:46.789 --> 29:49.522
so that we might be
blamed for stealing it.

29:51.683 --> 29:53.443
Give it to me, give it to me.

29:53.610 --> 29:55.233
You go home to your bed.

29:55.452 --> 29:57.225
I'll deal with this.

29:58.970 --> 30:00.931
Do you know who it was?

30:01.461 --> 30:03.961
I guessed it. You leave it with me.

30:07.193 --> 30:09.193
- Uh, no. No.
- (GROANS)

30:12.570 --> 30:15.970
You do have a thirst upon you
this evening, Simeon.

If emotion cannot reach the
secretary of the colony of Virginia,

30:22.250 --> 30:24.439
a respected man of position,

30:24.524 --> 30:27.768
then perhaps wine can.

30:32.064 --> 30:35.066
Nicholas, might I join you?

30:35.136 --> 30:37.175
Of course. (CLEARS THROAT)

30:37.424 --> 30:40.917
Please, Thomas, I meant to invite you.

30:46.194 --> 30:48.036
(LAUGHS)

30:48.290 --> 30:49.930
Wet suckets?

30:51.050 --> 30:55.170
Come along now, Nicholas,
into your mouth.

30:56.610 --> 30:58.262
Mmm.

30:58.444 --> 31:00.715
Delicious wet suckets.

31:00.810 --> 31:04.210
The Sharrows will soon provide us
with cinnabar.

31:04.290 --> 31:07.370
Then Master Peck
might conduct his experiment.

31:07.464 --> 31:09.347
Kissing comfits? (LAUGHS)

31:10.798 --> 31:12.461
Kissing comfits.

31:12.531 --> 31:16.180
I believe that Master Peck is suffering
from the effects of strong wine.

31:16.234 --> 31:19.130
- Oh, wine, is it?
- 'Tis no burden.

31:20.530 --> 31:25.116
He is drunk now
but soon this same man will...

31:25.741 --> 31:27.866
conjure for us supreme riches.

31:27.921 --> 31:33.610
I am trying to fathom if you truly
believe this biscuit-brained foolery

31:33.645 --> 31:37.137
that makes gold out
of spells and magic bottles of brew,

31:37.199 --> 31:43.537
or if you are blinded by lily-soft
cheeks and kissing comfits?

31:43.569 --> 31:47.130
Believe...
Believe I worship the possibility.

31:47.210 --> 31:50.675
Suppose he fails, Nicholas?
What will you say then?

31:50.807 --> 31:52.815
What will you do then?

31:53.128 --> 31:55.722
Who will you be... then?

32:19.290 --> 32:22.010
(SOBBING)

32:32.550 --> 32:34.495
Get out of my house!

32:35.073 --> 32:39.300
I was just... I'm sick.
I've been retching.

32:39.596 --> 32:42.090
Some food has poisoned me.

32:50.666 --> 32:52.166
(ARGHH!)

32:55.753 --> 32:58.292
Do you tell yourselves
that you might at last ruin me

32:58.316 --> 33:00.909
now that you find me weeping,
Widow Castell?

33:00.933 --> 33:02.933
(SNIFFLES, EXHALES)

33:07.152 --> 33:10.512
Well go ahead, tell him.
Tell the governor.

33:10.850 --> 33:13.930
I suppose that he would hang me
for being weak.

33:19.828 --> 33:23.197
If you believe that you know
the business of this colony,

33:24.479 --> 33:25.992
you fool yourself.

33:29.939 --> 33:33.257
Why do you suppose
that I was in Bermuda?

33:36.020 --> 33:38.260
It was Yeardley's bidding.

33:39.506 --> 33:41.727
So you can tell the governor
that you found

33:41.751 --> 33:43.657
the secretary on his knees.

33:44.274 --> 33:46.490
It will make no difference.

33:49.156 --> 33:51.076
He already possesses me.

33:53.043 --> 33:56.487
That is why he so keenly refuses
to suspect you

33:56.621 --> 33:58.621
- as the Spanish spy.
- (SCOFFS)

33:59.790 --> 34:01.390
No.

34:02.631 --> 34:04.896
No, he already knows who that is.

34:06.290 --> 34:09.250
I do not ask,
I am no wiser than you are.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.536
I did come here to ruin you.

34:15.578 --> 34:18.116
But when I saw a man so distressed,

34:18.483 --> 34:20.380
what I felt was pity.

34:25.100 --> 34:29.402
I prefer your hatred, Widow Castell.

34:30.929 --> 34:34.422
Please restore it to its full lustre
before you leave.

34:54.929 --> 34:56.690
It's better left, Veri.

34:57.810 --> 35:00.961
I know well enough how these came to
be in the negro's shack.

35:01.532 --> 35:04.250
And I will not let Pedro take the blame.

35:04.330 --> 35:09.337
I may be a thief but I ain't infected
with your horse-piss morality.

35:09.361 --> 35:11.361
(GASPS)

35:11.413 --> 35:18.510
I am sick of the likes of
you vermin and negroes,

35:18.580 --> 35:23.205
and Sharrows ogling my every intention!

35:23.268 --> 35:27.149
The Sharrows will not prosper!

35:27.548 --> 35:34.730
The bloodsucking Yeardley and his
shine-shoe recorder, the little prick!

35:34.810 --> 35:40.330
And pick and pick at my business
until there was nothing left, huh?!

35:41.930 --> 35:44.555
- Verity.
- (GASPS)

36:38.828 --> 36:42.090
You brought only the one thing,
I asked you for several.

36:42.170 --> 36:45.690
Cinnabar, do you want it?

36:52.973 --> 36:56.674
- It is a fine rock.
- We will name the reward for it.

36:56.737 --> 36:59.682
First let us discover
if it serves our purpose.

36:59.706 --> 37:00.976
No.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.905
We have fetched it, it is here,

37:03.975 --> 37:07.662
if you want it,
you will agree to our trade.

37:14.099 --> 37:18.238
We want that fine horse of yours,
Secretary Farlow.

37:18.316 --> 37:21.183
No, I will give you a promissory note.

37:21.437 --> 37:24.637
A horse is a small price
to pay for gold.

37:26.177 --> 37:28.497
There is more of the mineral if you
should want it.

37:34.097 --> 37:35.737
Will you trade the horse?

37:55.257 --> 37:56.915
Mistress Sharrow.

37:57.009 --> 38:00.250
I've never heard a man say
he hankers to bear a babe before.

38:00.274 --> 38:02.680
- I meant it.
- I do believe you.

38:02.828 --> 38:05.328
There's been times
I wished I was a man but...

38:05.500 --> 38:07.413
I've never heard men wish to be women.

38:07.438 --> 38:10.045
I do not wish to be a woman,
Mistress Sharrow.

38:12.497 --> 38:14.334
Why are you not afraid of the marshal?

38:14.358 --> 38:16.358
Because the law cannot crack me.

38:16.451 --> 38:18.684
You may be of assistance to me,
Mistress Sharrow.

38:18.708 --> 38:20.128
- Can I call upon you?
- What could I...

38:20.153 --> 38:23.168
You're an honest sort and
courageous enough to look.

38:23.231 --> 38:25.518
- And you are a woman.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

38:44.497 --> 38:46.142
Gentlemen,

38:46.839 --> 38:50.995
our calling today is the science of God.

38:51.425 --> 38:55.177
We must set out the room according
to cosmic conjunctions.

38:55.842 --> 39:00.865
And then we'll go about creating
philosophic mercury.

39:01.177 --> 39:03.857
- The philosopher's stone.
- (DOOR OPENS)

39:06.177 --> 39:08.249
Madam, this is not a matter for women.

39:08.304 --> 39:09.576
Oh, but it is!

39:09.577 --> 39:11.593
The combination of substances

39:11.672 --> 39:13.627
and the union of opposites,

39:13.696 --> 39:16.059
the mystical marriage of the lunar feminine

39:16.137 --> 39:18.044
and the solar masculine,

39:18.146 --> 39:21.028
this is the foundation
of the mystery we pursue.

39:21.169 --> 39:24.819
So too the most vital aspect of what
we conduct here.

39:24.905 --> 39:28.038
Words, cast to heaven
that they might serve

39:28.100 --> 39:31.687
as invocations, feminine invocations.

39:32.599 --> 39:35.399
Will you assist us, Widow Castell?

39:36.337 --> 39:40.948
So, Silas says to him, Secretary
Farlow, we will have your fine horse

39:41.026 --> 39:44.300
or you can dance on your toes for
this cinnabar.

39:44.370 --> 39:46.537
- We ain't giving it to you.
- (LAUGHS)

39:48.137 --> 39:51.937
When Sharrows trade there ain't
nothing better in this world.

39:53.554 --> 39:55.554
Woo-ooo! Woo!

39:58.790 --> 40:02.837
Salt, mercury, sulphur.

40:03.668 --> 40:05.228
The precious three.

40:06.177 --> 40:08.857
First, calcination.

40:10.057 --> 40:11.737
The humbling by fire.

40:26.357 --> 40:27.927
Dissolution.

40:28.357 --> 40:30.764
A world without hierarchy,

40:30.920 --> 40:34.850
the order of things breaks down,
but all might be reborn.

40:39.641 --> 40:42.921
After calcination, dissolution,

40:43.054 --> 40:46.257
separation, conjunction.

40:46.445 --> 40:48.774
We stand between the sun and the moon,

40:48.860 --> 40:50.896
masculine and feminine,

40:51.364 --> 40:53.364
bodies joined into one.

40:55.229 --> 40:59.205
WIDOW CASTELL:
Spirit above, matter below,

40:59.524 --> 41:01.945
fruits of sun and moon.

41:02.277 --> 41:04.707
For pure, self-moving source.

41:04.793 --> 41:08.550
WIDOW CASTELL:
For pure, self-moving source go fore.

41:09.249 --> 41:13.497
Lift up the light so that
all things unite.

41:30.626 --> 41:32.226
Let us be mad.

41:34.289 --> 41:37.427
- Mad.
- Mm, madness.

41:42.173 --> 41:43.853
Coagulation.

41:48.519 --> 41:50.373
Red pulvis solaris.

41:58.397 --> 42:00.397
Distillation.

42:02.197 --> 42:05.397
The elixir, prima materia.

42:06.414 --> 42:07.774
Where is the gold?

42:08.829 --> 42:10.509
It is here.

42:12.228 --> 42:14.884
This is merely the first experiment,
Governor.

42:14.952 --> 42:16.272
Many more will follow.

42:16.358 --> 42:18.577
Master Peck needs
sufficient time to make riches.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.914
Will we admit now that this is no more
than a charlatan's dance

42:21.961 --> 42:23.820
and cast this man out of Jamestown?

42:24.659 --> 42:26.108
Master Peck,

42:26.273 --> 42:29.367
you do not appear to be
a man beset by defeat.

42:31.290 --> 42:35.484
I have heard it said that alchemists
deliberately fail,

42:35.945 --> 42:38.532
let themselves be seen as hopeless frauds

42:38.634 --> 42:40.759
to dissuade those hungry to believe,

42:41.124 --> 42:44.524
thus keeping their true miracles
to themselves.

42:46.388 --> 42:48.175
There is deceit, sir,

42:48.285 --> 42:50.761
but not in order to rob
those anxious for gold.

42:51.672 --> 42:56.672
Rather to conceal the true purpose
of this marvellous art.

42:58.350 --> 43:00.415
The transformation of man.

43:01.028 --> 43:02.588
Let me show you.

43:17.068 --> 43:19.137
Widow Castell, I beg your assistance.

43:32.221 --> 43:34.406
- Sharrow.
- Here you are.

44:19.196 --> 44:21.275
You cannot wear a woman's apparel.

44:21.563 --> 44:24.900
I can if a women I be.

44:26.362 --> 44:28.393
Do you claim, sir,

44:28.479 --> 44:31.799
to be transformed from a man to a woman
by the process of alchemy?

44:31.869 --> 44:34.190
What stands before you, Governor,

44:34.323 --> 44:38.226
is the living,
breathing quicksilver proof,

44:38.289 --> 44:41.100
the true art is not cheap riches

44:41.163 --> 44:43.136
but the miracle of human metamorphosis.

44:43.922 --> 44:45.527
Dr Priestley,

44:45.683 --> 44:47.284
we will require an examination.

44:47.331 --> 44:48.461
Governor,

44:48.517 --> 44:51.977
I would beg that such an inspection
be also conducted by a woman.

45:09.306 --> 45:10.838
Pepper.

45:21.642 --> 45:24.042
We'll have Alice read it,
it's just some words.

45:33.338 --> 45:34.771
If you might lie down,

45:34.880 --> 45:37.325
- that I might examine you, sir.
- Madam.

45:49.042 --> 45:50.642
Is it possible, Doctor?

46:04.063 --> 46:06.702
Sir, I must ask,

46:06.950 --> 46:08.950
the morning that Samuel was killed.

46:09.100 --> 46:11.600
You heard he was
abroad on the governor's business.

46:12.042 --> 46:15.162
Why has it taken you so long to find
the courage to ask me, Jocelyn?

46:15.242 --> 46:17.423
Is there nothing here
that you do not know?

46:17.477 --> 46:20.442
The taverner runs his mouth off
to more than just friends.

46:21.170 --> 46:23.410
I saw the way you spoke
to the doctor today.

46:23.490 --> 46:26.664
You do not truly suspect him to be
the spy, you never have.

46:27.333 --> 46:29.893
Did you force that idea upon me to
distract me?

46:30.794 --> 46:33.826
If you know who it is, why do you
not denounce them?

46:33.927 --> 46:35.582
It's time you are married, Jocelyn.

46:35.651 --> 46:37.221
I'll speak to the doctor.

46:44.154 --> 46:45.880
Sir.

46:46.130 --> 46:50.544
It appears that Simeon Peck
has a dual nature.

46:53.278 --> 46:55.301
She is a woman and a man.

47:01.322 --> 47:05.342
Then you might wear your dress,
sir, madam,

47:05.414 --> 47:08.545
but you will no longer
practice alchemy in Jamestown.

47:23.083 --> 47:24.599
James Read.

47:24.958 --> 47:26.958
No one knows metal better than you do.

47:27.310 --> 47:31.162
What you witnessed, Master Peck's
process, any merit in it?

47:31.390 --> 47:33.790
Some things are meant to be as they are.

47:34.271 --> 47:37.583
If all could be gold then gold
itself would be no treasure.

47:38.482 --> 47:42.162
I believe that nature is best left
beyond a man's grasp.

47:42.242 --> 47:44.375
Quite the philosopher today, Read.

47:44.656 --> 47:46.149
For a blacksmith.

47:47.844 --> 47:50.217
What about the human
transformation, doctor?

47:50.834 --> 47:54.537
I suspect, sir, that Simeon
has always been a hermaphrodite.

47:55.602 --> 47:57.794
Then why the pretence?

48:13.803 --> 48:15.670
You see, Nicholas,

48:16.225 --> 48:18.944
I will be your woman for you.

48:19.915 --> 48:21.963
No law can forbid us.

48:25.273 --> 48:29.284
Do you imagine your being a woman
might make this innocent?

48:38.042 --> 48:40.423
I need the law...

48:41.314 --> 48:43.369
I love the law.

48:43.447 --> 48:47.523
The law is all I have to save me...

48:48.383 --> 48:50.505
from my appetite.

48:58.205 --> 49:00.391
There is not enough love in you

49:01.202 --> 49:03.089
nor any man,

49:03.480 --> 49:05.480
nor woman might cede me.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.400
If you have a care for me...

49:20.122 --> 49:23.162
you will leave Jamestown
on the first ship.

49:28.842 --> 49:31.642
(SOBBING)

49:41.042 --> 49:43.271
When will you marry
Mistress Castell, Doctor?

49:47.602 --> 49:52.962
She seems to cherish being a widow, sir.

49:53.744 --> 49:56.184
Then we must take that comfort away
from her.

50:00.956 --> 50:03.276
Will you read this for us, Alice?

50:04.722 --> 50:06.322
I'll try.

50:10.671 --> 50:12.030
Um...

50:17.341 --> 50:19.279
I...

50:20.482 --> 50:24.107
It seems that before it reached England,

50:24.201 --> 50:27.810
the ship was seized by privateers and...

50:29.239 --> 50:31.239
all our cargo was lost.

50:32.926 --> 50:35.842
What was the nature of these
bandits? Does it say?

50:35.922 --> 50:38.138
Spanish, Dutch, English?

50:38.240 --> 50:40.794
The captain of the Royal Moon
reported them to be Dutch.

50:40.825 --> 50:42.841
Did any mariners die
in the defending of the ship?

50:43.047 --> 50:45.356
- None.
- Look again at the letter, Alice.

50:45.438 --> 50:48.110
Does it say if Governor Yeardley's
cargo was also lost?

50:48.899 --> 50:51.002
No, it doesn't say that.

50:52.802 --> 50:55.369
Ours is stolen but his is safe.

50:55.463 --> 50:57.392
Ain't that suspicious?

51:02.061 --> 51:05.164
If Yeardley believes he's seen
the last of the Sharrow's anger

51:05.781 --> 51:07.976
then he will need new eyes.
