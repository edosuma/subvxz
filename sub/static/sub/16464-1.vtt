01:42.302 --> 01:44.327
Yo! What up, dawg?

01:44.337 --> 01:46.498
Yo, yo, yo,
diggity, yo!

01:47.373 --> 01:49.364
Yo, yo, yiggity-yo!

01:49.375 --> 01:52.367
Yo, yo, yiggity-do.

01:52.412 --> 01:55.506
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.417
Yo-yo?

01:58.451 --> 02:00.610
Oh, yeah, yeah, you better check yourself

02:00.620 --> 02:03.387
before you wreck yourself, because
that girl ain't nothing but trouble.

02:03.423 --> 02:06.324
Listen, this cock-a-doodle
do not do it that way.

02:06.326 --> 02:10.228
This cock-a-doodle-do
don't doodle-do that way.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.390
This cock-a-doodle-do
don't do that way.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.263
Geez, Peaches...

02:14.300 --> 02:16.325
shut your fuckin' pie-hole.

02:16.369 --> 02:17.461
Listen, home-skillet,

02:18.471 --> 02:22.305
I need some chedda',
to take my girl out,

02:22.408 --> 02:24.273
candy slack.

02:24.377 --> 02:27.037
I think the scene is about...

02:27.062 --> 02:29.062
uh, that, uh...

02:30.283 --> 02:34.447
The scene is about...
a girl and a...

02:35.488 --> 02:40.425
I think it's a comedy about a bunch of older cockers
in a retirement home, that's what it's about.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.527
Hi, my name is J Kimball,
I'm an actor.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.230
Hopefully, you actually knew that already,
otherwise, uh...

02:54.440 --> 02:57.341
I don't know... have a little
chat with my agent, I guess.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.375
Recently, I was asked to play a character...

02:59.412 --> 03:03.280
who ages into his mid-80's, in a new comedy

03:03.316 --> 03:09.346
which I think is entitled "Do Not Not Resuscitate."

03:10.323 --> 03:13.417
So, I gave it a good read, as I always do, and uh...

03:14.427 --> 03:15.958
it's terrible.

03:15.983 --> 03:17.396
Terrible.

03:17.397 --> 03:21.189
The dialogue is bland, the
characters are under-developed,

03:21.233 --> 03:24.031
the plot... a piece of crap.

03:24.136 --> 03:24.894
Honey?

03:24.895 --> 03:27.268
- Then I had a second thought.
- Are you ready to go?

03:27.307 --> 03:29.502
Did I mention that it was
written by my brother-in-law?

03:30.243 --> 03:32.268
My darling wife's adorable baby brother?

03:33.513 --> 03:35.344
Turn that thing off.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.248
- I'm working.
- You haven't seen her in 6 months.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.250
Honey, I'm busy here.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.486
- You promised.
- Your project.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.487
Your mother!

03:42.255 --> 03:43.449
Just let me... give me...

03:45.325 --> 03:48.351
So I got a choice.
I can do the movie, or...

03:48.428 --> 03:50.293
suffer the consequences.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.363
You married guys know
what I'm talking about.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.229
Obviously, I'm doing the movie.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.393
And, since I have no idea what
it's like to be 85 years old,

03:57.403 --> 03:59.496
I'm gonna need to do more research than usual.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.034
And I figured I'd invite you
all along to suffer with me.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.908
The only question is,
am I gonna do that research

04:04.934 --> 04:07.170
where my mother is,
at the Nancy Gaye...

04:07.212 --> 04:10.373
Why-the-hell-don't-you-visit-me-more-often
Nursing Home...

04:10.516 --> 04:13.417
or... at The Coconuts Convalescent Home,

04:13.519 --> 04:17.250
conveniently located across the street
from my favorite casino?

04:20.392 --> 04:21.360
Shuffle up and deal.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.431
This is for your own personal use, correct?

04:32.438 --> 04:36.465
Yeah, yeah. I always like to do research,
makes the characters I play more real

04:36.509 --> 04:39.478
for me, you know?
And hopefully for the audience as well.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.438
It's, uh... usually just gonna
be Bob here, y' know,

04:42.448 --> 04:43.472
couple of guys on the crew.

04:43.516 --> 04:46.280
Em, sometimes I'll just shoot myself,

04:46.286 --> 04:48.311
and sometimes we'll both shoot, at the same time.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.380
But don't worry about them.
They're.. they're non-union.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.390
Oh. Good.

04:51.391 --> 04:55.521
Though I am happy to sign a
release, or a contract...

04:55.528 --> 04:57.359
No, that won't be necessary.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.626
Uh, so tell me... how
long have you been the

04:59.632 --> 05:01.261
Activities Director here?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.427
At The Coconuts? Well, uh,

05:03.336 --> 05:05.395
I haven't always been an administrator.

05:05.405 --> 05:08.373
Life... is but a walking shadow.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.342
A poor player that...

05:10.376 --> 05:12.367
struts and frets...

05:12.378 --> 05:15.506
his hour upon the stage,
and then...

05:15.949 --> 05:17.940
is heard no more.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.242
You're an actor.

05:21.287 --> 05:22.447
I'm between roles.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.423
Oh, now, I know how that goes.

05:24.524 --> 05:25.953
When was your last gig?

05:25.959 --> 05:26.620
November.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.660
- Well, that's not so...
- 1998.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.966
Listen, what I...
just really wanna

05:35.201 --> 05:36.493
kinda get out of all this, is uh...

05:36.502 --> 05:39.369
an overall feel for
what it's like here

05:39.405 --> 05:40.372
for the old people.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.499
You know? Um, do they get visitors?

05:42.508 --> 05:45.272
Do they get exercise?

05:45.311 --> 05:46.845
Uh... What gets them up?

05:46.946 --> 05:47.773
In the morning, you know?

05:47.813 --> 05:49.504
And, indeed, can they still...

05:49.549 --> 05:50.447
get it up?

05:50.450 --> 05:53.283
How do old people get around?

06:00.393 --> 06:01.360
Well, first off...

06:01.394 --> 06:04.261
we don't like to call them
"old people."

06:04.263 --> 06:07.391
They're just people,
like you and me, only

06:09.402 --> 06:10.426
old.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.431
- I can't find my glasses!
- They're on top of your head.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.442
Oh, they're on top of my head.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.245
You didn't mention how long you will be with us.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.246
A couple of weeks.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.278
Splendid!

06:23.316 --> 06:27.953
So, the idea here at The Coconuts is
to make our residents feel at home.

06:28.087 --> 06:29.681
Of course, we try to keep things interesting,

06:29.722 --> 06:31.519
mix it up a bit.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.458
In many respects, it's a lot
more fun than how they lived

06:40.466 --> 06:42.297
before coming here.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.326
Yes, sure! I see that, uh...

06:44.470 --> 06:46.438
Thursday is cherry pie day.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.374
I'm also very excited
about a new event we have

06:49.375 --> 06:53.368
scheduled for next month.
We're putting on our first "talent show".

06:53.413 --> 06:57.281
So they, uh, still have the energy
to compete this late in life?

06:57.316 --> 07:00.444
Oh well, yeah. I don't like to
speak in clichÃ©s, you know,

07:00.486 --> 07:03.478
"never too late" and all that,
but, uh... you'd be surprised.

07:03.889 --> 07:06.415
And, I might add,
uh, reassured

07:06.526 --> 07:08.494
by what some of them still can do.

07:12.498 --> 07:16.491
- But, but, but... she's my niece!
- Yeah, I can see the resemblance.

07:16.502 --> 07:20.438
- I only need one more minute.
- Yes, well your niece will have to come back

07:20.473 --> 07:22.373
at regular visiting hours.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.273
I hope you wore a condom.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.505
Condoms? We ain't got no condoms.

07:26.546 --> 07:29.276
We don't need no condoms.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.477
I don't have to show you stinking condoms!

07:31.517 --> 07:33.485
You do if you don't want
your dick to fall off.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.447
You're just jealous because
I have a pretty face.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.514
And bigger balls.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.419
Ah, shall we take a look around,
and introduce you to some of our

07:44.464 --> 07:47.228
residents, who can help
you in your research?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.426
- Okay.
- Yeah...

07:48.434 --> 07:50.368
You really scared me
on that prison show.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.331
I've always secretly wanted a tattoo.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.272
Oh-ho-ho, you...

08:05.384 --> 08:08.353
So, this is our recreation room.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.257
What do you think,
stripes or solids?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.383
How the fuck should I know?

08:13.426 --> 08:17.385
Have they invented Braille balls since
I last checked, honkey mother fucker?

08:18.364 --> 08:20.229
Okay, nice to meet you.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.423
That's Bernard.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.297
"Big Sexy"!

08:23.336 --> 08:25.395
Oh, yes, "Big Sexy."

08:25.438 --> 08:29.431
He's harmless, and um, visually-challenged.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.470
Hello, ladies.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.243
Hi.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.270
Morning.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.341
<i>- And one, and two.</i>
- This is our all-purpose room.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.284
Oh! You've come at a good time.
We're implementing some

08:41.320 --> 08:44.483
innovative changes to health and exercise.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.416
Telephone! Telephone!

08:50.296 --> 08:54.323
<i>And one, and two, and three.</i>

08:54.433 --> 08:55.491
<i>And four.</i>

08:56.369 --> 08:58.234
<i>And one,</i>

08:58.271 --> 08:58.498
<i>And two...</i>

08:58.504 --> 09:02.235
That son of a bitch manager
stole my watch again!

09:02.241 --> 09:05.301
Rex, no one has stolen your watch.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.941
Who the hell are you?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.306
I'm the son of a bitch
who took...

09:09.415 --> 09:10.439
Nurse!

09:11.417 --> 09:12.475
Knock, knock.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.286
Who's there?

09:20.259 --> 09:21.226
Whoa!

09:21.260 --> 09:25.321
So... that's about it.
Why don't you make yourself at home,

09:25.364 --> 09:27.332
talk to some of our residents.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.325
I have to get back to the office,
but if you need anything...

09:30.469 --> 09:31.527
anything at all,

09:32.305 --> 09:34.273
- just ask.
- Okay. Thanks, Greg.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.434
I'll just hang out here and see
what the geezers are up to.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.282
Gimme back my watch!

10:37.436 --> 10:38.403
Hi, guys.

10:38.404 --> 10:39.371
What's up?

10:39.505 --> 10:41.473
My dick, if you rub it.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.440
Listen, boy...

10:42.441 --> 10:44.375
this bench is for white's only.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.345
Don't worry about Big Sexy.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.245
Uh, you guys mind if I
just ask you a few questions?

10:50.349 --> 10:54.217
- Still a free country.
- Not for long, the Mexicans are takin' over.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.252
Don't worry about him.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.515
You're here to find out what
it's like to be old, right?

10:59.525 --> 11:00.457
Yeah, right.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.220
It's horrible.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.488
My back hurts all the time,

11:03.530 --> 11:04.497
I can't sleep at night.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.790
- Colonoscopies.
- It's just awful gettin' old.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.336
Every day I have to wear diapers
'cause I can't control my bladder.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.462
I'm constipated.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.297
You guys are pathetic!

11:15.041 --> 11:18.101
Every morning, 6 a.m., I
have a nice strong piss,

11:19.412 --> 11:22.347
6:30 I have a good firm bowel movement.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.977
Of course, I don't wake up till 7:00...

11:26.002 --> 11:28.002
Ba-dum-bum!

11:35.294 --> 11:36.488
Is he still here?

11:38.264 --> 11:39.162
Yeah, still here.

11:39.966 --> 11:43.326
That's very funny guys. I guess you don't lose
your sense of humor when you get old, huh?

11:44.170 --> 11:46.138
But seriously, what
do you want to know?

11:46.673 --> 11:48.065
Well, you know, everything.

11:48.507 --> 11:52.341
I dunno, you guys look like you're pretty fit,
what do you do for exercise?

11:57.516 --> 11:59.381
<i>Eat shit, faggot.</i>

12:00.519 --> 12:02.316
<i>Jesus, Frank, now take it easy.</i>

12:02.922 --> 12:04.422
<i>And... dead.</i>

12:04.891 --> 12:07.250
- This is.. it's research. It's for a movie I'm doing.
- A movie?

12:08.260 --> 12:10.421
- You a Jew?
- I'm an actor.

12:10.496 --> 12:14.296
I just wanna find out what
it really feels like to be old.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.425
Now you're callin' us old?

12:16.368 --> 12:19.235
- You are old!
- That's not what your mama said last night!

12:19.772 --> 12:22.566
Wow... So come on, seriously,
what do you guys do?

12:22.591 --> 12:23.842
How do you keep in shape?

12:23.943 --> 12:25.811
We play a lot of paddle tennis.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.309
Well, what is that? Paddle tennis?
Is that even a real thing?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.473
Bet we could whip your ass!

12:31.560 --> 12:32.760
You think so?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.555
Rex and me... against you.

12:37.389 --> 12:41.519
You win? We let you hang out
with us for your research.

12:42.394 --> 12:45.454
We win, we get to
be in your movie.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.294
Sure, all right. Deal.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.298
Deal!

13:02.849 --> 13:04.808
Where's Rex?

13:09.323 --> 13:12.390
Ruth... come on.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.049
Out!

13:53.800 --> 13:55.064
Out!

14:17.889 --> 14:19.289
In!

14:22.962 --> 14:24.896
In.

14:42.123 --> 14:42.923
We won!

14:43.149 --> 14:44.649
We won!

14:45.151 --> 14:47.847
Yeah, yeah.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.889
Looks like you lost.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.928
- I think the fix was in.
- I just call 'em like I see 'em.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.927
This guy had a ringer. You totally cheated.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.791
Hollywood! Here we come!

15:03.102 --> 15:05.002
Okay, all right,
deal's a deal.

15:05.437 --> 15:06.301
Tell you what...

15:07.273 --> 15:08.331
you can still hang with us.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.236
Eh? Thanks...

15:10.376 --> 15:12.503
- I think.
- Just don't touch my junk.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.506
I'll try to resist that urge.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.420
This might be tougher than I thought.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.148
How's your research going?

15:27.794 --> 15:29.853
Should've visited your mother instead.

15:31.798 --> 15:32.965
Thank you, dear.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.730
New guy.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.304
Three o'clock.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.318
First time?

15:53.552 --> 15:55.349
Yes, sir.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.680
- Scared it'll hurt?
- That you'll be humiliated?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.584
Never hold your head
up in public again?

16:00.392 --> 16:03.418
I'm just here 'cause my doctor said,
y' know, it's time to get it checked out.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.456
Maybe you'll squeal like a pig.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.390
Feel like you're being
raped, in prison.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.490
And start to like it.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.265
That's the goal.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.298
Listen, nice chattin' with you guys,
I gotta finish this script.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.299
I remember when I was a virgin.

16:16.876 --> 16:17.934
Yeah? A while ago?

16:18.410 --> 16:19.342
'52.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.275
Oh, this really ages you.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.506
Remember Art's son, Frankie?

16:23.515 --> 16:24.504
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.884
Insufficient lube.

16:26.052 --> 16:26.984
It got stuck.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.388
Like goin' to the electric chair,
and they forgot to wet the sponge.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.354
Sounds like Frankie forgot to relax.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.324
They lasered his poop-hole.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.323
Really?

16:36.395 --> 16:38.897
- Had to laser it shut.
- Oh, I hope he got a good lawyer.

16:38.922 --> 16:40.498
And ripped him a new one.

16:40.499 --> 16:44.299
Does a kind of side-saddle
maneuver on the john now.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.996
- Oh, but other than that, he's fine.
- Colon's clear.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.005
Yeah, yeah. Clear colon.

16:49.441 --> 16:50.499
Kind of a semi-colon.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.244
Not that he uses it much anymore.

16:58.484 --> 17:02.420
Is there any room, on either side of you guys?
We're a little squished in here.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.415
Well, you know, they give you a DVD.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.355
- Yeah, they film it.
- I heard that.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.290
A keepsake you'll always treasure.

17:09.461 --> 17:11.486
You know, man looks into the abyss,

17:12.464 --> 17:15.330
and see's himself staring back at him.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.997
All part of growin' older.

17:18.470 --> 17:19.367
Lookin' forward to it.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.305
Bernard, we're ready for you.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.410
Mmm, you smell good.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.849
Why, thank you.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.118
Hey! Come on, now, you...

17:33.143 --> 17:35.143
watch it!

17:41.393 --> 17:42.952
- You're next.
- Oh, go ahead.

17:43.495 --> 17:45.326
- No, you.
- You go first.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.297
- You'll thank me.
- After you.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.458
- You're gonna really like this.
- She seems a little upset.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.730
You are gonna get so used to this.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.531
- Please go.
- You'll be so happy.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.234
I have many years ahead of me.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.274
- Might even tickle.
- Go.

17:57.443 --> 17:58.767
- Take a chance!
- I'm gonna go home.

17:58.878 --> 17:59.806
No, no! Stay!

17:59.831 --> 18:01.331
Stay!

18:02.514 --> 18:05.210
Mistake.

18:12.124 --> 18:15.252
So, uh, Rex... what are you
doing for the big talent show?

18:16.395 --> 18:18.295
What talent show?

18:18.764 --> 18:21.657
Uh, the... that's...
Not to worry, we'll come back to you.

18:21.782 --> 18:22.634
Bernard, what about you?

18:23.335 --> 18:25.428
Don't worry about me,
I'm workin' on it.

18:25.537 --> 18:26.338
Okay.

18:26.363 --> 18:30.263
Why they want you to have any
good time in this damn place?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.237
We're right in the middle of an interview!

18:32.511 --> 18:34.308
That's okay, I don't mind.

18:35.414 --> 18:37.214
Okay, what are you doin'
for the talent show?

18:37.683 --> 18:41.744
- I don't do that stupid shit.
- You gotta love the president's stimulus package.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.280
Is that what's payin' for all this?

18:44.523 --> 18:46.388
You see the new girl that checked in yesterday?

18:48.494 --> 18:51.486
I hesitate to ask here, Victor...
what is... what is goin' on there?

18:52.464 --> 18:56.400
Oh, sexting! With a
shawty I met last week.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.436
He's addicted to sext, you know?

18:58.704 --> 19:00.763
Wow, that's, uh...

19:01.507 --> 19:03.407
She hittin' you back, there?
Is that what's goin' on?

19:06.712 --> 19:08.406
Ooh! Where'd you meet her?
Comic-Con?

19:09.414 --> 19:11.279
She was a friend of my wife's.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.940
I didn't know you were married.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.443
Well, I'm not.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.310
Anymore...

19:18.758 --> 19:20.658
Oh. I'm sorry. What, uh...
what happened?

19:23.228 --> 19:28.325
Kandearoo.
Kandearoo...

19:28.500 --> 19:31.230
What is that? What is Kandearoo?

20:00.941 --> 20:02.341
Jesus!

20:02.467 --> 20:04.435
I mean, there's no way to stop it?

20:23.789 --> 20:27.315
God! That's... that's terrible. Victor, I'm

20:27.459 --> 20:30.326
I'm so sorry man, I- I didn't know.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.472
Va-va-verga!

20:43.342 --> 20:44.400
You gotta be kiddin' me.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.207
- Breckin! Breckin Meyer!
- Hey guys!

20:47.232 --> 20:48.232
- Where you goin'?
- How's it goin'?

20:48.257 --> 20:50.757
I'm going to play some laser tag with
some elderly folks. You wanna watch?

20:50.916 --> 20:52.008
Mind if we tag along?

20:52.517 --> 20:54.417
Yeah, actually, I want the footage, come on.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.114
- We love your show, uh, Frank and Beans.
- Oh, thanks brother, we're having a good time.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.525
J!

20:59.550 --> 21:00.558
- There he is!
- How's it goin'?

21:00.559 --> 21:02.156
- Hey, man, thanks for coming.
- All right.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.387
Good to see you, and these guys just, what?
Follow you around

21:04.400 --> 21:05.665
Yeah, it's my entourage,
you don't mind do you?

21:05.690 --> 21:06.397
Whatever.

21:06.398 --> 21:09.334
- Who's this?
- "Who is this?" Who doesn't have a television?

21:09.359 --> 21:10.401
What, are you kidding me?

21:10.402 --> 21:12.267
- Breckin Meyer, how ya' doin'?
- What are you, twelve?

21:12.337 --> 21:13.395
- 12 inches.
- Bracken Meyers.

21:14.306 --> 21:15.398
- Breckin Meyer?
- Yes sir.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.408
It sounds like a strand of
Ukrainian syphilis to me.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.371
Kinda' mouthy for a blind
guy playing laser tag.

21:21.413 --> 21:25.349
Oh! Before the cock crows three times,
you shall be punked by the blind.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.680
- Is he, did he just call me a cock?
- Apparently so.

21:29.254 --> 21:32.485
Okay, Father Time? Cryptkeeper? Methuselah?
Let's go, let's do this.

21:33.325 --> 21:37.421
All right, welcome to your ultimate laser tag
adventure, are you guys excited to be here?

21:37.496 --> 21:40.329
- Oh yeah.
- Awesome, that's nice.

21:40.365 --> 21:45.061
Uh, so my name is Justin and this is Daniel,
my trusty sidekick. Everyone say "Hello Daniel."

21:45.270 --> 21:46.464
Hello, Daniel!

21:46.538 --> 21:48.403
And we're gonna be your Game-Masters today.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.470
Did he say Gay Masters?

21:50.596 --> 21:53.424
What sort of S&M bullshit
did you bring me to today?

21:53.477 --> 21:55.246
So let's get started.

21:55.414 --> 21:58.181
When you guys walk in that door, you're
gonna see a bunch of vests like this one,

21:58.217 --> 22:01.078
and what you want to do is grab the vest off
the rack and throw it over your shoulders

22:01.153 --> 22:04.347
- making sure the laser is in front.
- Looks like an electric dick.

22:04.423 --> 22:07.415
It sure does. If the laser isn't
in front your pack's on backwards

22:07.492 --> 22:09.917
and that's stupid because you
can't fire out of your butts.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.526
- Oh, this guy here can.
- I bet!

22:13.065 --> 22:16.157
So then you wanna strap in your sides and
then you're gonna detach your laser from the vest,

22:16.235 --> 22:18.294
and hold the vest with the laser
with two hands at all times.

22:18.470 --> 22:19.859
- How many hands?
- Two hands. - Two!

22:19.938 --> 22:23.372
That's right, two hands. Now, you
wanna fire everywhere and anywhere

22:23.442 --> 22:25.239
you see blinking, flashing lights.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.438
So, if it's blinking, you blast it.
What do you do? You...

22:27.512 --> 22:30.276
- Blast it.
- Come on guys, what do you do?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.442
- Blast it!
- That's right, you blast it!

22:32.484 --> 22:34.315
All right, Daniel take it over.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.254
All right, we're gonna go over some
important game rules for today.

22:37.322 --> 22:40.416
Ah, the first rule is the
most important, you guys...

22:40.492 --> 22:44.061
No running. If you run, you're done.

22:44.128 --> 22:47.097
Seriously, with you guy's hearts,
if you run, you're done.

22:47.232 --> 22:49.291
You're gonna die. This'll be it.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.269
- I'll beat your little ass.
- No climbing or crawling.

22:52.337 --> 22:55.431
No crawling anywhere in the maze, you guys.

22:55.507 --> 22:58.011
Uh, no physical contact.

22:58.037 --> 23:00.826
Yeah, Victor, that means keep
your hands off my junk, too. Okay?

23:01.346 --> 23:05.148
No touching.
Uh, no unsportsmanlike conduct.

23:05.217 --> 23:09.153
If it don't feel cool, it ain't cool,
and that includes offensive language.

23:09.321 --> 23:12.615
No... that includes trash talking,
no trash talking, you guys.

23:12.657 --> 23:14.254
- That's bullshit.
- Totally.

23:14.326 --> 23:17.318
Next rule, follow staff instructions at all times.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.364
We... are staff.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.458
Last rule, any persons failing
to follow these rules

23:22.534 --> 23:26.368
will be asked to leave without a refund.
So, if you just follow these rules, you guys...

23:26.438 --> 23:27.762
we'll have a great game, okay?

23:27.839 --> 23:29.439
- We'll be good.
- Whoo! - Okay!

23:29.508 --> 23:31.038
- Yeah!
- Okay. Let's do it.

23:31.063 --> 23:32.076
Go, old people!

23:32.077 --> 23:33.235
Not you guys.

23:39.985 --> 23:41.213
Rex! It's me!

23:53.365 --> 23:55.333
- Damn.
- Right, are you okay?

23:55.367 --> 24:00.395
- Bernard? What? Is it your heart?
- You.. dirty... bastards!

24:17.422 --> 24:19.447
Say "hello" to my little friend!

24:20.525 --> 24:22.254
Hey.

24:26.932 --> 24:27.990
Fish in a barrel.

24:34.406 --> 24:37.500
Hey. Looks like we won.

24:38.376 --> 24:41.504
That's it! You're all out.
You run, you're done!

24:42.280 --> 24:44.271
You run, you're done.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.376
- We have to go.
- That's true, Justin.

24:47.452 --> 24:51.411
You break the rules,
you get no refund.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.292
Seemed like a short game to me.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.361
Hey, where Rex?

24:57.496 --> 24:59.464
You guys keep up on the
latest technology at all?

24:59.531 --> 25:02.700
- Well, I've seen color TV.
- I got a stereo.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.362
Beautiful, welcome to the
21st century here guys,

25:05.387 --> 25:07.387
this... is a smart phone.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.599
Can make phone calls, of course, you can also do a
shit-load of other things, but here, wait, wait...

25:12.310 --> 25:15.404
I'll show you on this 'cause it's got a
bigger screen for your tired old eyes.

25:16.381 --> 25:21.444
You can, uh, you can surf the web here, you got
emails, I got thousands of photos in this thing.

25:21.486 --> 25:25.813
Uh... music, got a calendar, maps!
You got maps of the whole world on this thing.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.521
There's a... there's thousands of apps you can
get for this, all on this one little device.

25:29.594 --> 25:33.328
It's, it's unbelievable. It's a dazzling
display of technology, right?

25:33.398 --> 25:35.389
It's like a phone, only bigger.

25:37.369 --> 25:44.366
Okay. Here, look. Look at this, this is the most
portable, powerful, lightweight notebook money can buy.

25:44.442 --> 25:47.642
And I can do all that same stuff on this,
but I can also, I can upload footage here,

25:47.913 --> 25:49.972
I use this for my research
all the time, I can edit,

25:50.415 --> 25:53.282
- I could, I could make a movie on this thing.
- Really?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.319
- Yeah.
- So you could make a porno?

25:55.353 --> 25:58.516
Porno, you want porno, here we go.
In two seconds,

25:59.291 --> 26:02.419
just for you, eyes and ears,
we have porno!

26:04.362 --> 26:08.458
<i>Oh yeah. Oh yeah, spank
the monkey, smart boy.</i>

26:09.334 --> 26:11.427
Damn.

26:15.273 --> 26:16.403
Hello?

26:16.828 --> 26:17.928
Hello?

26:20.278 --> 26:21.472
Hello!

26:39.464 --> 26:42.456
You seem nice.

26:44.302 --> 26:49.399
I'm also a pretty good dancer.

26:51.509 --> 26:55.343
I'd like to see you dance.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.415
Oh.

27:23.713 --> 27:25.474
<i>...really do see the market to continue to trend...</i>

27:25.499 --> 27:27.499
<i>- ...know why I'm here in the first place.
- Skank.</i>

27:29.877 --> 27:32.748
...now there's a line drive
down the left field line...

27:34.386 --> 27:37.287
<i>Do you know the secret to a
long-lasting relationship?</i>

27:38.289 --> 27:40.450
<i>Good communication?</i>

27:40.525 --> 27:42.356
<i>Romantic dinners?</i>

27:43.528 --> 27:45.765
<i>Walks in the park?</i>

27:46.190 --> 27:48.790
<i>Those are all great, but not even close.</i>

27:49.234 --> 27:54.494
<i>A recent survey found that 104 percent of males said
the secret to a long-lasting relationship is...</i>

27:54.572 --> 27:59.070
<i>a great blowjob!
And now, for the first time on TV,</i>

27:59.080 --> 28:01.273

<i>And if so, what flavor?</i>

28:11.289 --> 28:13.257
<i>Spit?</i>

28:13.458 --> 28:15.221

Oh, my!

28:44.456 --> 28:47.448
Ruth Mama Zion! Where did you get that bikini?

28:48.393 --> 28:51.260
Amazon.com.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.397
What has gotten into you lately?

28:53.465 --> 28:57.265
Turns out you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.463
Something's missing.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.337
Very funny.

29:16.454 --> 29:18.319
Very good! Very good!

29:20.325 --> 29:21.383
What?

29:21.493 --> 29:23.427
Where are ya'?

29:23.528 --> 29:25.119
- You're hot.
- I know you're in here somewhere.

29:25.144 --> 29:26.263
You're gettin' hot.

29:27.364 --> 29:30.390
- Where are you?
- Hotter.

29:31.302 --> 29:33.293
Yea!

29:47.352 --> 29:50.253
Does Greg know you're
out here this late?

29:50.321 --> 29:51.447
It's only 6 o'clock.

29:53.458 --> 29:57.394
- Hi Ruth.
- Oh. Hi Victor.

29:58.363 --> 30:00.388
Well, I'm gonna go get changed.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.365
I'll see you at dinner.

30:06.471 --> 30:10.430
God, that daughter of his...
really get's him down.

30:10.508 --> 30:14.501
Yeah, I know. She only visits him
for the life insurance money.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.281
Oh, poor guy.

30:39.270 --> 30:40.532
Hi, Victor.

30:41.372 --> 30:44.500
You know how cute I always thought you were.

31:35.526 --> 31:39.292
Gee... are there any Q-tips?

31:44.535 --> 31:46.435
Hang on!

31:56.447 --> 31:59.211
Doesn't anybody fucking knock anymore?

32:00.285 --> 32:03.012
- So, I don't want to play this guy like he's feeble or senile or...
- Honey?

32:03.037 --> 32:04.354
- doesn't know what's going on in the world.
- Honey?

32:04.355 --> 32:07.518
- Just a sec'! These guys wanna have sex, they can still get it up.
- Who spanked the monkey? Hmm?

32:07.959 --> 32:09.048
Apparently.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.261
- Smart boy?
- Okay, let me tell ya'.

32:11.296 --> 32:14.322
I was showing the old farts
about computers today,

32:14.365 --> 32:17.459
and about getting on the internet, and about
all the stuff I can do on the computer like

32:17.502 --> 32:21.404
editing, and you know, I said I could make my own
movie, this guy Bernard says could you make a porno

32:21.406 --> 32:24.073
and I said, oh, well here,
lemme show you some porno.

32:24.109 --> 32:27.010
- These guys are like, they're like conniving little children.
- Sweetheart?

32:27.078 --> 32:29.945
- What?
- It's okay. I trust you.

32:30.348 --> 32:31.474
- You do?
- Yes.

32:31.983 --> 32:34.244
It's a convalescent home, how much
trouble can you really get into?

32:35.320 --> 32:36.514
I think you'd be surprised.

32:37.322 --> 32:39.381
Yeah? Oh...

32:39.558 --> 32:40.718
surprise me.

32:48.399 --> 32:52.392
Hello everyone.
My new best friend, J,

32:52.437 --> 32:57.465
has generously offered to ask today's special
guest to come in and show you some...

32:57.508 --> 32:59.499
invaluable self-defense moves.

32:59.544 --> 33:03.344
When I heard he was coming,
I got all choked up.

33:04.248 --> 33:08.344
Ah, I'm proud to introduce
Mr. Randy "The Natural" Couture.

33:08.453 --> 33:11.320
Who the hell is Randy Couture?

33:11.322 --> 33:15.586
Mr. Couture came in second on the 9th
season of "Dancing With The Celebrities".

33:16.260 --> 33:20.492
Actually, I'm a former UFC heavyweight champion
and inductee into the UFC Hall of Fame,

33:20.498 --> 33:23.433
but, you gotta be talking about Chuck Liddell.

33:24.402 --> 33:27.269
Who was, what, ninth on that dance show?
And I'm...

33:27.438 --> 33:29.303
way better looking than he is.

33:29.874 --> 33:32.242
Mr. Couture is a mixed martial arts legend.

33:32.276 --> 33:33.770
This guy practically invented the sport.

33:33.811 --> 33:35.545
What is he talking about?

33:35.847 --> 33:40.282
That shit ain't a sport. Just
a buncha ass-grabbin' homos

33:40.307 --> 33:42.607
who didn't get enough lovin' from their mothers.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.184
Is he gonna teach us to dance like a star?

33:45.223 --> 33:49.091
Oh, ho, ho, I wish! Mr. Couture was nice
enough to come down and teach us some of the

33:49.394 --> 33:52.295
basic movements of mixed martial arts.

33:52.330 --> 33:55.265
He's gonna show you some pretty neat stuff,

33:55.299 --> 33:56.425
so you can protect yourself,

33:56.467 --> 33:58.367
should the need arise.

33:58.403 --> 33:59.461
So...

34:11.282 --> 34:15.411
let's get ready to wrestle!

34:19.389 --> 34:23.257
Well, thank you ladies and gentlemen.
I'm very excited to be here this afternoon,

34:23.293 --> 34:25.455
although not quite as excited as Greg here.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.297
How many of you have seen
what we do in the Octagon?

34:30.501 --> 34:34.437
Okay. Well, we could do a demonstration,
so... I need a volunteer.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.264
How about you, sir?

34:38.376 --> 34:40.310
I want to demonstrate some
pretty simple techniques

34:40.311 --> 34:42.245
that don't require a lot of speed or strength,

34:42.280 --> 34:45.272
but if you apply them properly, you
can take out even the biggest guy.

34:45.382 --> 34:50.320
I want to make sure I isolate that bottom arm,
locking out that elbow and that wrist.

34:50.521 --> 34:55.389
And from there, it's pretty easy to escape,
or even turn the situation around.

34:55.426 --> 34:58.395
If you're ever attacked from the front,
somebody tries to grab you,

34:59.330 --> 35:03.289
I wanna take that arm off, drag it by,
and now I get behind my attacker.

35:03.334 --> 35:04.794
From here, I wanna apply a rear choke,

35:04.835 --> 35:06.803
so I'm gonna wrap my arm around his neck,

35:07.371 --> 35:09.498
I'm applying pressure to
both those carotid arteries.

35:09.507 --> 35:12.374
I'll lock this technique on, in about 7 seconds

35:12.410 --> 35:14.275
my attacker will pass out.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.380
Now, you're a big strong guy.

35:17.482 --> 35:20.246
- You wanna try that technique?
- Okay.

35:20.551 --> 35:23.982
Okay, again. The rear choke, he
wraps the arm around the neck.

35:24.489 --> 35:27.420
All right, let's slide this hand behind
that's gonna make it nice and tight.

35:28.392 --> 35:32.419
Now from here, if I let him apply the choke,
he starts to cut off the blood... Hey, hey, hey...

35:32.497 --> 35:34.294
that's gettin' tight.

35:34.332 --> 35:36.357
He starts to... and, uh...
and...

35:40.238 --> 35:41.227
Oh my god!

35:41.472 --> 35:44.305
Oh! My god!!

35:45.309 --> 35:46.435
Does anyone have a camera?

35:47.345 --> 35:50.405
This'll be perfect for my Facebook page.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.233
You guys pickin' up some
costumes for your grandkids?

36:11.502 --> 36:13.402
- (mumbling)
- What?

36:14.272 --> 36:15.466
- (mumbling)
- What?

36:15.473 --> 36:19.409
Go fuck yourself.

36:20.378 --> 36:21.470
Oh...

36:22.313 --> 36:25.510
Douchebag says "what".
And I said "what".

36:26.951 --> 36:29.244
Do you believe that salesman
talking about the grandchildren?

36:29.269 --> 36:31.254
Like we came here for grandchildren.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.223
- Do you believe that?
- What a nerd. Ooh!

36:33.257 --> 36:35.225
This is the row.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.061
- This is the row.
- Oh, really?

36:37.095 --> 36:38.255
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:38.280 --> 36:39.462
Yeah.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.294
- Oh, yeah.
- Sexy?

36:41.332 --> 36:42.501
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

36:42.526 --> 36:44.526
Oh-ho yeah!

37:35.353 --> 37:37.412
Here! Try these on.

37:41.492 --> 37:43.357
So how do I look?

37:44.528 --> 37:46.393
Really scary.

37:47.365 --> 37:49.230
Is the air conditioning on?

37:50.334 --> 37:52.325
Seems a little cool in here.

38:00.344 --> 38:03.211
Hey, old timers, you wanna buy
a map to the star's homes?

38:03.247 --> 38:04.407
You got Brangelina?

38:04.548 --> 38:06.482
- Sure.
- You gonna ask her out?

38:07.285 --> 38:10.311
- It depends.
- Say, you got any black people in there?

38:11.089 --> 38:14.058
- Tiger?
- Oh! He's my hero!

38:14.258 --> 38:15.486
He's a master sexter!

38:15.526 --> 38:17.323
Wait a minute.

38:17.361 --> 38:20.296
- He's black?
- Yeah.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.332
Really?

38:26.437 --> 38:28.462
He's nice.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.101
Nice costume.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.238
You too.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.309
Trick or treat!

38:46.424 --> 38:49.393
That's a damn good question
you've asked, fellows.

38:49.427 --> 38:51.258
This "Trick or Treat."

38:52.263 --> 38:54.322
Quite the conundrum, really.

38:55.433 --> 38:57.367
Having said that,

38:57.468 --> 39:00.232
my costumed friends,

39:00.271 --> 39:04.207
as fate would have it,
I, too, have a question.

39:05.309 --> 39:07.470
Brace yourselves, it's a doozy.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.313
Which one of you pricks can guess,

39:10.348 --> 39:13.317
what I've buried under my house...

39:15.353 --> 39:17.287
Where you going? Hey!

39:17.521 --> 39:20.388
I got Reese's Pieces in here.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.324
And Winston Lights, come back!

39:30.368 --> 39:31.426
I'll be right back.

39:32.069 --> 39:33.127
I gotta do somethin'.

39:33.371 --> 39:37.432
I wasted a whole hour watchin'
this douchebag's TV show.

39:53.457 --> 39:56.290
Happy Halloween.

39:57.361 --> 39:58.453
Sir?

39:59.463 --> 40:01.488
Are you... is this ding dong ditch?

40:02.299 --> 40:03.459
By a hundred-year-old?

40:05.369 --> 40:08.304
Is this you running away? Sir?

40:08.339 --> 40:10.500
That's funny. That's very funny.

40:12.276 --> 40:14.506
You're not... you're not moving
very fast, sir. I could...

40:15.312 --> 40:18.247
come down there and stick a
candy bar up your fuckin' ass.

40:18.349 --> 40:19.407
If I felt like it.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.350
Sir.

40:21.519 --> 40:23.384
Have I done something to offend you?

40:23.421 --> 40:25.355
In the past? I'm just curious

40:25.356 --> 40:28.416
because I'm just sitting on my couch,
waiting for obnoxious children

40:28.459 --> 40:31.257
dressed like Spiderman.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.297
Fuck you, sir.
Fuck you.

40:33.531 --> 40:35.465
Okay?

40:36.300 --> 40:37.358
Fuck you!

40:38.402 --> 40:42.270
I hope you have a fuckin'... horrible birthday,
if you ever have one... again.

40:45.242 --> 40:46.300
Now I'm fuckin' depressed.

40:52.516 --> 40:54.313
Is this my man's place?

40:54.351 --> 40:56.285
I think so.

41:03.494 --> 41:06.361
- Hey, fellows.
- Trick or treat!

41:07.331 --> 41:10.459
Come on, isn't there an age
limit on trick or treating?

41:10.501 --> 41:12.492
Just give us some candy, bitch.

41:13.370 --> 41:18.239
Wow... well, Mr. Geezer, perhaps you've
had a little too much sugar, huh?

41:18.242 --> 41:22.235
Look, I'm a rich fucker, how did you get in here?
Right? There's a security guy out there.

41:22.346 --> 41:24.405
I don't like old people coming in and I just...

41:24.515 --> 41:27.279
Get the fuck out of my place.
This is my house!

41:27.485 --> 41:29.419
I didn't get any candy.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.461
Oh, hell no. Oh, hell no.

42:30.347 --> 42:34.306
So, who'd be the bitch now, bi-atch?

42:40.324 --> 42:42.485
So let's see, where we are right now.

42:44.495 --> 42:46.429
What's this?

42:48.365 --> 42:54.361
Hey, hey, hey! Shh, shh, shh! Guys, keep it down
just a little bit, okay? My wife's sleeping.

42:54.471 --> 42:56.302
Is this it?

42:56.373 --> 42:59.140
Oh, this is my office-slash-mancave.

42:59.176 --> 43:02.370
- It's where I do most of my work.
- Where's the indoor pool, and the manservant?

43:02.446 --> 43:05.438
Come on, inside voice, okay?
I gave Cheswick the night off.

43:05.482 --> 43:08.417
Somebody wake me when it's time to
go, this place is boring as shit.

43:09.286 --> 43:11.345
What's with all the boxes?
Are you moving?

43:11.522 --> 43:13.490
No. No, um...

43:14.391 --> 43:19.390
A while back, my... my mother had a bad
fall and broke her hip, so you know,

43:19.415 --> 43:21.415
we had to put her in a rest home, I'm...

43:22.333 --> 43:24.267
- I'm goin' through her stuff.
- Where is she?

43:24.368 --> 43:27.428
- Nancy Gaye.
- Jesus Christ!

43:27.453 --> 43:29.405
Why in the world would
you put her there?

43:29.406 --> 43:33.240
- What? What's wrong with it?
- Talk about boring, why don't you just ship her straight to the morgue?

43:33.277 --> 43:35.302
Come on, it's not that bad.

43:35.412 --> 43:38.279
- "It's not that bad?"
- When was the last time you were there?

43:41.485 --> 43:44.283
Another ungrateful kid.

43:45.422 --> 43:47.253
I just...

43:48.459 --> 43:51.292
I just can't see her like that.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.333
Will somebody help me down from here?

43:59.403 --> 44:03.362
- Nice wheels!
- Yeah, I'm proud of Buster Hymen.

44:03.440 --> 44:09.345
I got a dual 12-volt, 95 amp-hour,
deep-cycle, lead-acid sealed battery

44:09.547 --> 44:17.515
with removable armrests for maximum maneuverability,
there's tracks in back, for snow, mud, and deep sand

44:18.522 --> 44:22.390
high performance hybrid tires for off-roadin'

44:23.293 --> 44:24.453
leather seat,

44:25.462 --> 44:31.367
and double-reinforced hand grips for
superior handling and enhanced control.

44:33.270 --> 44:34.430
What do you need all that for?

44:45.315 --> 44:46.441
Victor!

44:55.325 --> 44:57.293
Damn!

45:35.365 --> 45:40.530
Come on, come on, come on, hurry!
Come on, you can!

45:45.542 --> 45:47.442
Congratulations.

45:52.382 --> 45:57.376
Welcome everyone.
It is so nice to see you all.

45:58.422 --> 46:01.414
I am excited about our project today.

46:01.492 --> 46:03.426
Because...

46:04.261 --> 46:08.391
we are going to try something a little different.

46:10.267 --> 46:11.461
Come on in.

46:11.535 --> 46:14.368
Come on, don't be shy.

46:15.339 --> 46:17.330
This is Luke, everyone.

46:17.407 --> 46:21.309
Luke, you just step right up here and
turn around and, um...

46:21.378 --> 46:25.439
Well...

46:25.482 --> 46:28.474
- Oh, my!
- Meh!

46:30.320 --> 46:31.344
No.

46:43.433 --> 46:46.459
Well. Oh, Bernard.

46:47.304 --> 46:50.273
- You're joining us today.
- They canceled Bingo.

46:50.340 --> 46:54.299
Well, it's very nice to have you.
Just come right over here,

46:54.545 --> 46:57.480
I have a chair for you, right next to Victor.

46:58.348 --> 47:02.485
Okay, here's the chair.
Oops, there you go. And...

47:02.486 --> 47:07.549
Never thought I'd be sittin' in a
girlie class with peckerwoods like you.

47:08.292 --> 47:10.419
We got a nude model today.

47:10.527 --> 47:12.495
- Go on!
- Yep.

47:13.430 --> 47:15.330
Big titties?

47:16.433 --> 47:19.266
Oh... very well endowed.

47:19.336 --> 47:22.362
Well, wait till she gets a load of Big Sexy.

47:23.273 --> 47:27.437
Okay, class, now, let's begin

47:27.544 --> 47:33.505
by entering the clay with our
hands and taking hold of it.

47:34.484 --> 47:37.615
Yes, let it envelop your imagination...

47:37.822 --> 47:39.915
as it does your fingertips.

47:41.391 --> 47:47.425
Oh, become one with its and soft, pliable wetness.

47:47.865 --> 47:52.825
Let go of your inhibitions and
mold the piece to your will.

47:53.503 --> 47:59.305
Now, maybe you want to focus
on one certain area...

48:00.444 --> 48:04.346
Like, um...
the eyes, or...

48:05.515 --> 48:07.346
the feet...

48:07.417 --> 48:09.248
for example.

48:09.319 --> 48:14.416
Or, maybe just the overall
essence of the model.

48:15.425 --> 48:18.223
Oh, knead and stretch,

48:18.262 --> 48:21.425
pull, prod, and twist the clay

48:21.498 --> 48:23.466
into submission.

48:28.272 --> 48:30.263
Uh... Well, let's see what we have here.

48:30.507 --> 48:35.501
Oh, my! That's very van Gogh, Rex.

48:37.381 --> 48:40.282
Oh, why that's excellent realism, Ruth.

48:40.517 --> 48:42.451
And very nice, Mary.

48:43.487 --> 48:45.455
Mary?

48:45.480 --> 48:47.080
Ah-hah...

48:47.491 --> 48:51.325
Oh, Victor!
Victor, um...

48:52.396 --> 48:54.261
Yes!

48:54.531 --> 48:56.465
And Bernard!

48:56.901 --> 48:58.892
Bernard, that's very imaginative.

48:59.369 --> 49:03.237
That is very good use of
personal interpretation.

49:03.340 --> 49:09.336
Oh, and please. Please feel free to use your
hands on the model, to mold what you see.

49:09.413 --> 49:14.441
I mean, after all, art is as much
about feeling as it is about seeing.

49:15.285 --> 49:17.378
Damn, this must be my lucky day.

49:17.487 --> 49:19.352
Oh, I wish it were me.

49:19.389 --> 49:21.254
Come on, I'll take you to the model.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.560
All rightie? Here we go.

49:24.962 --> 49:29.956
And I have a chair for you... have
a seat right here, there you go.

49:30.768 --> 49:34.795
And I'll just wheel you
right up here, and here...

49:34.939 --> 49:36.839
let's begin with the foot.

49:38.364 --> 49:40.364
Oh! Ooh...

49:42.312 --> 49:44.371
Big Sexy likes your feet.

49:47.851 --> 49:49.045
Oh! And you work out, too.

49:53.357 --> 49:55.484
You need to shave more often, baby.

49:56.293 --> 49:57.453
Ooh, that's hot!

49:58.495 --> 50:01.487
Come to papa, Sugar Bush!

50:02.065 --> 50:05.193
Oh-oh! We got us a problem here.

50:05.903 --> 50:08.872
I don't think you sugar,
because that sure ain't no bush.

50:09.373 --> 50:11.432
Gotcha.

50:16.413 --> 50:19.382
Well, I hope you get a refund from the rabbi.

50:28.058 --> 50:30.083
Still your turn, Rex.

50:34.431 --> 50:37.366
What's, uh... what's that little transaction there?
What do you keep handing her?

50:37.401 --> 50:39.335
Oh, just makin' some extra cash.

50:39.436 --> 50:42.496
- Extra cash?
- Yeah, I sell my Percocet and Vicodin.

50:43.473 --> 50:45.338
You're a drug dealer?

50:45.375 --> 50:49.402
No, I'm not a drug dealer, I just sell drugs
people want to buy. That's all.

50:50.514 --> 50:55.315
- You guys are really not what I expected.
- It's a good way to help pay some of the bills.

50:55.385 --> 50:58.479
Since they legalized medicinal marijuana,
been a windfall for us.

50:58.956 --> 51:01.083
- So you're a drug dealer too?
- I'm not a drug dealer.

51:01.491 --> 51:06.428
You just go to the doctor and you say "Oh,
Doc, I have terrible migraines this week."

51:06.496 --> 51:11.297
And then next thing you know you got 500
bucks in ganja and Medicare covers the bill.

51:11.334 --> 51:13.234
Your tax dollars at work.

51:13.303 --> 51:15.872
- See that dried-up prune over there?
- Yes.

51:15.939 --> 51:18.874
She's been screwin' his brains out for months,
just for his drugs!

51:19.342 --> 51:20.810
That's not his granddaughter?

51:20.945 --> 51:24.076
Uh-uh... She found him on Craigslist.

51:25.015 --> 51:25.982
That's pretty sad!

51:26.083 --> 51:27.072
Not for him.

51:27.951 --> 51:28.918
So what did you expect?

51:29.152 --> 51:30.817
What do you mean?

51:30.854 --> 51:33.948
I mean, since we're not what you expected,
then what did you expect?

51:34.024 --> 51:36.783
- Oh, uh, I don't know...
- Don't be a pussy now,

51:36.860 --> 51:42.093
- Well, I guess I thought you'd be...
- Sitting around, waiting to die?

51:42.900 --> 51:44.959
Yeah, sort of...

51:45.002 --> 51:47.869
Depressed, decrepit and useless?

51:48.906 --> 51:49.998
A little, maybe...

51:50.074 --> 51:52.042
Angry, bitter, and rude?

51:52.443 --> 51:55.173
All right, look. I admit, I was
buyin' into a stereotype, forgive me,

51:55.245 --> 52:00.179
but... let's face it, there's a lot of stuff
you guys just can't do like you used to...

52:00.217 --> 52:04.119
and Rex, he wouldn't remember to eat lunch
if it wasn't written down on a note somewhere.

52:06.890 --> 52:07.857
That's true,

52:08.625 --> 52:12.628
but I bet you any one of us here
is more content with his life

52:12.930 --> 52:14.090
than you are.

52:22.940 --> 52:24.905
Percocet?

52:28.245 --> 52:31.305
- Hey Sandy, only two today.
- Oh, good!

52:31.849 --> 52:34.010
It's here! It's here!

52:34.084 --> 52:37.918
Ruth? I've never seen
you so excited before!

52:38.021 --> 52:40.990
Oh, it's it! It's the DVD!

52:41.058 --> 52:43.891
It's here!

52:43.961 --> 52:47.988
Oh, baby! I've been waiting for you!

52:52.970 --> 52:55.029
Virgin territory!

52:55.139 --> 52:58.973
Excuse me ma'am, may help carry
your package to your room?

52:59.042 --> 53:04.105
Honey, you can carry mine,
if I can carry yours!

53:22.966 --> 53:24.900
Looking sharp there, Victor!

53:25.002 --> 53:27.095
- Nice hat.
- Thank you.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.909
- Oh, um... where's Rex!?
- Yes, where is Rex?

53:43.887 --> 53:46.048
And the music's even shittier than last year!

53:46.256 --> 53:48.923
Any hot bitches around?
Ow!

53:49.092 --> 53:51.959
- Josephine...
- She's married!

53:51.995 --> 53:52.962
Buford dies last month!

53:53.063 --> 53:54.052
Really!

53:54.898 --> 53:55.887
Pay up!

53:57.901 --> 53:58.925
Take it!

54:00.337 --> 54:03.033
So she's on the rebound, eh?

54:03.106 --> 54:05.165
Oh, she's on the ultimate rebound.

54:05.475 --> 54:08.142
I'll have to tap that ass!

54:08.211 --> 54:11.305
Give her my number!

54:15.252 --> 54:21.316
Thanks everyone for joining us for
our sixth annual Moonlight Hootenanny!

54:22.092 --> 54:25.289
This year's theme will incorporate
our "Going Green" initiative,

54:25.796 --> 54:28.993
there'll be a lot of special editions and
exciting changes in the coming weeks.

54:30.067 --> 54:31.329
I wanna give a shout-out to Edith

54:31.769 --> 54:34.162
for providing tonight's exciting ear candy,

54:34.237 --> 54:39.174
and remind everyone of our special
"Ladies' Choice Dance," so...

54:39.242 --> 54:41.301
without further ado,

54:42.312 --> 54:45.145
Now... it's a party!

54:45.215 --> 54:47.240
What is with the shit-eating grin?

54:48.350 --> 54:51.786
Things are gonna start
looking up around here!

54:52.189 --> 54:54.350
âª I'm too sexy for my love âª

54:54.375 --> 54:59.275
âª Too sexy for my love âª
âª Love's going to leave me âª

55:15.512 --> 55:17.873

âª Too sexy for my shirt âª
âª So sexy it hurts âª

55:23.259 --> 55:25.623
âª I'm too sexy for Milan âª

55:25.648 --> 55:30.648
âª Too sexy for Milan âª
âª New York and Japan âª

55:38.771 --> 55:41.571
âª I'm too sexy for your party âª

55:41.796 --> 55:46.071
âª Too sexy for your party âª
âª The way I'm disco dancing âª

55:46.806 --> 55:49.996
âª I'm a model âª
âª You know what I mean âª

55:50.221 --> 55:53.621
âª And I do my little turn on the catwalk âª

55:53.846 --> 55:58.146
âª Yeah, on the catwalk âª
âª On the catwalk, yeah âª

55:58.171 --> 56:01.671
âª I do my little turn on the catwalk âª

56:11.134 --> 56:12.362
Oh! I think I'm stuck!

57:20.721 --> 57:23.651
Hey, hey... I got the munchies.

57:24.540 --> 57:27.566
Let's find Rex and get
the hell out of here!

57:51.288 --> 57:55.264
âª Face down, ass up âª
âª That's the way we like to fuck âª

57:58.911 --> 58:02.811
âª Face down, ass up âª
âª That's the way we like to fuck âª

58:03.036 --> 58:04.617
âª I'm lookin' for a bitch to spend the night âª

58:04.642 --> 58:06.520
âª Do the crazy thing while I fuck all night âª

58:06.545 --> 58:08.209
âª I make her do things like nothing before âª

58:08.234 --> 58:10.184
âª And when I'm done, she'll always be sore âª

58:10.209 --> 58:11.512
âª From the things I do when I'm fuckin' âª

58:11.870 --> 58:13.892
âª And when I'm tired, the bitches start suckin' âª

58:13.917 --> 58:15.641
âª I double team with a friend of mine âª

58:15.666 --> 58:17.513
âª Luke's in front and I'm behind âª

58:17.538 --> 58:19.307
âª Just ridin' you like a pony âª

58:19.332 --> 58:21.521
âª While you suck my dick, makin' me horny âª

58:21.546 --> 58:23.246
âª Then all of a sudden we'll switch positions âª

58:23.271 --> 58:25.080
âª Prop your ass up and freak the pushin' âª

58:25.105 --> 58:26.942
âª And when I cum, you'll hear me roar âª

58:26.967 --> 58:28.533
âª I'll treat any bitch like a whore âª

58:28.558 --> 58:30.611
âª 'Cause it's the way I like to fuck âª

58:30.636 --> 58:33.026
âª It's face down and ass up! âª

58:33.309 --> 58:36.035
(indistinct)

58:36.213 --> 58:37.913
Fuck that burger!

58:43.150 --> 58:44.509
Fuck!

58:44.587 --> 58:45.645
It's the cops!

58:45.722 --> 58:49.419
Everybody run!

58:57.700 --> 59:00.567
Driver's license, registration,
and proof of insurance.

59:01.671 --> 59:02.695
Turn the camera off!

59:03.606 --> 59:05.540
- J? Is that you?
- Hi, Kev.

59:05.608 --> 59:07.576
- Doin' some research.
- No problem.

59:11.714 --> 59:13.648
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

59:14.751 --> 59:16.582
I don't think so.

59:16.652 --> 59:20.588
It was my turn to be the designated driver.

59:20.690 --> 59:23.682
- Right guys?
- Yes, yes! - Yeah.

59:23.707 --> 59:26.707
<i>Face down, ass up
That's the way I like to fuck</i>

59:27.597 --> 59:28.689
Turn the music off!

59:29.465 --> 59:32.457
Always pulling over the black guy!

59:35.205 --> 59:36.263
Get out of the car, sir.

59:36.639 --> 59:41.541
Okay sir, I'm gonna administer some tests to find out
if you're too impaired to operate a motor vehicle.

59:42.212 --> 59:46.408
The first thing I want you to
do is take your index finger,

59:46.482 --> 59:50.316
tilt your head back, and touch the tip
of your finger to the tip of your nose,

59:50.586 --> 59:52.679
in this manner, and alternate.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.995
Okay, next...

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:05.966
I want you to count
backwards from 78 to 69.

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:07.696
69...

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:09.732
70!

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.498
72 ..

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:14.701
73 ..

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:17.442
Okay. Okay, we're almost done.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.839
I want you to walk a straight line,

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:22.749
now I want you to do it
heel-to-toe, just like this...

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.051
Then turn around,

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.055
and walk back.

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:40.092
Uh, Sir! Sir, sir, sir, sir!

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.430
Based on my observations,
I believe you've had too much to drink.

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:45.503
Have I?

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:50.444
This is a breathalyzer. I want you to blow
into the breathalyzer until I say stop.

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.118
- There.
- Here...

01:00:57.453 --> 01:01:05.622
Blow! Blow Blow! Blow! Blow Blow!
Blow! Blow Blow! Blow! Blow Blow!

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:07.720
And stop.

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.667
I'll be! You're clean.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:16.931
Told you.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.540
Look, you're free to go,
but, will you speed up?

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:29.650
Say... thanks for lettin' me drive.

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:31.481
I always wanted to do that.

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:35.588
That was you?

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:40.457
Now, time for a booty call.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:46.725
This is Ruth! Oh, I'm so sorry,
I can't come to the phone right now.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.737
I learned how to give a great BJ.

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:52.631
Oh, yeah.

01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:00.549
I feel like shit.

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:03.685
That's disgusting!

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:17.458
These fuckin' low-flow
toilets don't flush a thing.

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.261
I'm too old for this shit!

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.398
I'm gonna stop drinking for good.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.197
I mean it this time.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:33.215
Well, like they say down south...

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.377
We gonna see y'all now, hear?

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:27.758
You guys sure know how to party.

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:30.028
Oh-ho! You should've seen Victor.

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:33.174
I thought I was gonna die last night.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:39.080
You know, I've been meaning to ask you guys.
Are you afraid of dying?

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:41.207
- Nah.
- I'm not afraid of dying.

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.251
I'm afraid of outliving my money.

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:46.178
I can afford to live about six more years.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.223
I can afford about five.

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.280
And then what?

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:57.156
But... but the idea of death itself,
you don't, you don't find that scary?

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.031
- Nah.
- Oh, hell no!

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:02.134
In fact...

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.136
we got a death pool.

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.167
A death pool?!

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.073
Yeah, see?

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:10.303
You pick who you think is next to die.

01:04:11.114 --> 01:04:13.048
If you're right, you win.

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:15.116
What if two guys pick the
same person to die?

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:20.212
Well then, we use cause of death.
Heart attack, stroke...

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.314
See? Whoever gets the closest.

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:26.186
Don't some people find the idea of
a "death pool" a little offensive?

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:29.163
Well, you don't have to play if you
don't want to, but most everyone does.

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:32.028
Some that do,
I won 100 bucks last month.

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:35.169
- He got lucky with Wilber.
- That wasn't luck.

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:37.330
I was watchin' him, he'd
been coughing for weeks.

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.269
You don't mess around with
pneumonia at this age.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.270
Good riddance.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:47.278
- Good riddance? Come on, the poor guy's dead.
- Just because he's dead doesn't mean he...

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:49.476
wasn't an asshole when he was alive.

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:53.188
So, Bernard, who do
you have next to go?

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.947
- Victor.
- Victor?!

01:04:54.972 --> 01:04:56.291
Oh, yeah.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:57.316
Well that's messed up!

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.091
How the hell do you have me going?

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.221
O.D., drug overdose.

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:05.198
Well then, I'm changing my pick to you.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:08.168
You'll either get hit by a bus or
drown in the pool.

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.204
I'll decide later.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.832
All right, so listen, uh...

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.237
tomorrow, tomorrow night!
Is the big talent show.

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:16.300
You guys ready?

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.113
Ready as I'll ever be.

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:20.773
I've been practicing for weeks.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:24.019
I'm tellin' you, nobody
stands a chance against me.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.713
Oh, I don't know. From what I've
heard, you may have some stiff competition.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.116
Well that ain't the only
thing stiff around here.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:33.289
Where the hell's my phone?

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:37.030
I'm always losing the damn
thing when I'm drunk.

01:05:40.203 --> 01:05:43.138
So, these old geezers have
a lot of life left in 'em.

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:45.632
I don't know, maybe getting old
isn't the worst thing in the world.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:49.176
Beats the alternative, as they say.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:11.328
<i>Nancy Gaye Nursing Home...</i>

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:15.094
Hi, can you please connect
me with Pat Kimball's room?

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:29.079
Boys, I'd like you to meet my Mom.

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:33.087
She's hot.

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:19.289
I know everyone has been diligently rehearsing
their numbers and is ready to show you their stuff!

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:21.493
Get on with it!

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.041
Cut! Cut!
Cut it now!

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:37.045
- That was good! Uh, Pete, did you get that?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.082
Okay, then print it. Nice job!
It's a wrap!

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.412
Cut! That...
It sucked.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.856
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!
It sucks. It's...

01:08:49.957 --> 01:08:53.017
I wouldn't use this...
as fill in a porno.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:59.227
Cut! Cut! Cut!
One word review: shit sandwich.

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:05.229
Cut! Cut! It's just... they're...
you're not... the whole thing is it's...

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:08.236
it's no good.

01:13:58.129 --> 01:14:00.157
A woman goes to a gynecologist.

01:14:00.482 --> 01:14:05.141
She says, "Doctor, I can't find my pussy cat!"

01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:08.761
The doctor says, "..."

01:14:11.986 --> 01:14:17.213
Guy comes home, and he says, "Honey! Honey!
Pack your bags, I just won the lottery!"

01:14:18.238 --> 01:14:20.238
"Where are we going?"

01:14:20.263 --> 01:14:23.363
"I don't care! Just get the fuck out!"

01:14:24.305 --> 01:14:30.178
