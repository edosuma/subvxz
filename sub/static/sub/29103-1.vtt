Look at me. You're her big brother.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.526
She looks up to you.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.902
Used to.

13:05.243 --> 13:09.987
Well, one day, I just hope
that I walk through that door

13:10.039 --> 13:11.995
and I see the two of you sitting there.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.577
How many years you got left?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.579
Two, with good behavior.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.744
- So how many, really?
- Four.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.914
Well, you know what they say.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.716
"Never say 'never.'"

13:24.679 --> 13:25.964
GUARD: Time's up.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.587
You behave yourself.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.802
Will do. Love you, darling. (KISSES)

13:29.851 --> 13:31.182
Love you too. (KISSES)

13:34.314 --> 13:36.270
(MAGDALENE LAUGHS)

13:45.366 --> 13:48.824
All right.
MAN: Lucas Rebecca Hobbs.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.407
I haven't seen you in forever.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.993
- "Rebecca"?
- Do you even age? How long's it been?

13:54.917 --> 13:56.248
- Six months.
- Time flies.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.956
- When we're apart.
- What is your skin care regimen?

13:59.005 --> 14:01.872
Because you look
like a young Shirley Temple.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.290
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Daddy, who is this guy?

14:04.344 --> 14:07.256
Well, this guy is Locke.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.346
And he works for the CIA.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.244
- Your dad and I are old friends.
- We're not old friends.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.348
Actually, we're...

14:14.228 --> 14:15.622
We're best friends. Here's the half heart.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.977
I don't know what that is.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.168
- We got some ink together as well.
- We did not get ink together.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.807
- Oh, we didn't?
- No, we did not.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.921
- Interesting. I seem to remember...
- We never got ink together.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.813
Getting a little something like this
at one point on my body.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.982
- Jesus.
- Christ, I miss our playful banter.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.679
You have one minute
to tell me what you want

14:30.703 --> 14:32.097
before I knock one of your lungs loose.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.907
You and I are after the same thing.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.038
Say hello to the CT-17 virus.

14:36.084 --> 14:39.201
It's a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.744
Affectionately code-named "the Snowflake."

14:41.798 --> 14:42.958
What does the Snowflake do?

14:43.007 --> 14:45.874
Oh, nothing much.
Just liquefies your internal organs.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.714
Basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup.

14:48.763 --> 14:49.969
She is nine.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.470
- Seen worse.
- Where?

14:51.516 --> 14:52.926
Game of Thrones. Janet's house.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.953
- I've never heard of it.
- A Lannister always pays his debts.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.808
You're never going over there again.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.936
But there's a new
wrinkle in the case, Rebecca.

14:58.981 --> 15:02.769
The specifics... are all in the brief.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.150
There you go.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.569
- She's ready, Becca.
- She's nine. She's nine!

15:06.614 --> 15:09.697
This is the only unit of CT-17
in existence,

15:09.742 --> 15:14.327
and this Snowflake is now in the hands
of a rogue MI6 operative in London.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.908
Dad, are all spies that pretty?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.536
No. She is unusually attractive.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.075
And deadly.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.212
Last night she was part of an MI6 team
tasked with securing the virus.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.873
She then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.418
She stabbed one guy in the chest
using a brick.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.007
Do you know how hard that is?

15:32.056 --> 15:33.842
To stab someone using a brick?

15:33.891 --> 15:36.120
- Get to the point.
- The point is there's no sharp edge.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.726
How did she get an entire brick
into another person's chest?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.307
She either had to be really strong

15:40.356 --> 15:43.769
or the other person had to have been,
like, born without, like, bones.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.400
- Get to the larger point.
- She stole the Snowflake.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.528
- She went totally off-grid.
- Who's this?

15:48.573 --> 15:50.564
That's the scientist
we believe created the virus.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.402
Great. Where do I find him?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.989
He's off-grid too.
Impossible to find. Maybe dead.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.074
- You're very helpful, Locke.
- And you're the world's best tracker.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.864
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

15:59.917 --> 16:03.250
Oh, no, no, no. I'm DSS, you're CIA.
I don't work for you.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.912
Your boss loaned you out.
You do now, dickface.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.276
- What'd you just call me?
- Hey, hey, hey!

16:07.300 --> 16:08.790
Let's just settle down. All right?

16:08.843 --> 16:10.612
We've already got
a black site running in London.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.343
There's an operative there.
Top of his game. He'll be your contact.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.050
I don't need anybody else. I work alone.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.260
We got bigger problems
than your fragile ego,

16:17.310 --> 16:20.302
or the fact that a moment ago
I most definitely shit my pants.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.355
The entire world
is at stake here, all right?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.016
This thing gets out, we're looking at
a lot of liquefied organs,

16:27.069 --> 16:29.025
and I mean, like, everywhere.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.027
And not just yours and mine.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.907
Uh... He knows I can see him, right?

16:37.205 --> 16:38.820
He knows nothing, Jon Snow.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.330
(SAM CHUCKLES)

16:41.375 --> 16:42.831
So what's it gonna be, Becky?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.242
You gonna partner up?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.582
- I'm in.
- Of course you are.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.312
Do you remember what I told you in Rwanda?

16:50.927 --> 16:52.792
- "Stop watching me sleep."
- I said:

16:53.346 --> 16:56.133
- "We are not friends at all."
- We're best friends.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.173
- And to watch your back.
- Wash your back, yeah.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.762
- Oh, I remember.
- Watch your back.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.141
Lot of back. I got you.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.519
Hey. Same old Hobbs, huh?

17:03.564 --> 17:04.644
Same old Locke.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.391
All right. Who's on the case?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.442
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA)

17:16.452 --> 17:18.864
- Mr. Shaw.
- Whatever it is, I ain't buying it.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.743
You don't know what I'm selling,
or who I am.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.825
CIA.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.617
- How could you...
- Sunglasses, cloudy day, sensible shoes.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.375
I have fallen arches, and I don't have
a lot of choice in what I...

17:29.423 --> 17:31.818
Anyway, I'm Agent Loeb, and I need
to talk to you about our shared interest.

17:31.842 --> 17:32.877
How'd you find me?

17:32.927 --> 17:35.964
I GOT A TIP FROM AN ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS:
Mr. Nobody.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.128
Mr. Nobody.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.300
Little joke for you, Loeb.

17:39.850 --> 17:43.263
What do CIA operatives
and baseballs have in common?

17:43.312 --> 17:45.598
People cheer when you hit them with a bat.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.683
No.

17:47.108 --> 17:50.020
They are two things
I don't give a toss about.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.564
That works too.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.114
The weapon she's stolen
is not like anything we've ever seen.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.530
It's a programmable disease
that can target any DNA sequence

18:04.584 --> 18:07.701
with a 100% mortality rate
inside 72 hours.

18:07.753 --> 18:11.041
If MI6 finds her,
they're gonna treat her like a traitor.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.297
MAN ON PHONE: We need you
to surrender the virus.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.716
What is your location?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.670
What, you think I killed them?

18:19.724 --> 18:22.682
LOEB: But if you help us find her,
if you bring us the virus,

18:23.060 --> 18:24.641
we'll grant her immunity.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.313
We've set up a black site here in London.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.462
You've got everything you could need
at your disposal,

18:32.486 --> 18:35.102
and we're bringing in an asset
from the States to assist you.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.566
I don't need anybody.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.197
Maybe not, Mr. Shaw.

18:38.868 --> 18:39.903
But she does.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.451
- My guy's in.
- My guy's in too.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.146
Is your guy gonna freak out
when he finds out who my guy is?

18:49.170 --> 18:51.035
Didn't they just do a job
together in New York?

18:51.088 --> 18:53.204
Didn't they just destroy
the DSS field office in LA

18:53.257 --> 18:54.838
by throwing each other through it?

18:54.884 --> 18:57.626
I don't know. Look,
I don't know about your guy, but my guy?

18:57.678 --> 18:59.948
He's gonna get this.
He's gonna pull this off. You know why?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.463
We've been best friends
our whole goddamn lives.

19:02.516 --> 19:06.429
Well, my guy beat the shit out of me
at a bar in Krakow 17 years ago,

19:06.479 --> 19:08.140
and he doesn't even remember me.

19:08.189 --> 19:10.646
So we all have our histories.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.431
Anyway, it's the fate of the world here.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.565
It's the fate of the world.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.693
The planet's population is in their hands.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.853
Serious stuff.

19:16.906 --> 19:20.023
You'd think they'd be able to put aside
any petty rivalries to save the world.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.236
Mm. Mm.
(SLURPING)

19:21.619 --> 19:23.325
- No fucking way.
- No fucking way.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.828
I'm not working with this guy.
I've been there, done that.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.660
The minute he gets involved,
you can kiss goodbye to any finesse,

19:28.709 --> 19:31.121
because She-Hulk here
only knows how to smash.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.661
And Mr. Arson here
only knows how to blow shit up.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.067
- The fact is...
- And the fact is...

19:35.091 --> 19:36.752
- no offense...
- oh, no offense...

19:36.801 --> 19:39.041
- this guy's a real asshole.
- This guy's a real asshole.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.004
That's "sumbitch" in your native tongue.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.298
That'd be "wanker" in your native tongue.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.309
Are you finished blubbering?
You sound like a giant tattooed baby.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.096
I'm not listening to this horseshit.
I got a job to do.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.600
Tell your mom I said hi.
Actually, I'll tell her myself.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.573
Don't you ever talk about my mother.
I'll put your head through that wall.

19:58.614 --> 20:02.357
Secondly, I'll have this job done while
you're still putting on your baby oil.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.525
Good luck, slick.

20:03.577 --> 20:06.535
(SNAPS FINGERS)
That's it. You just reminded me.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.617
That's exactly why
I hate working with you.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.616
It's your voice.

20:12.461 --> 20:16.079
It's your nasally, prepubescent,
Harry Potter voice.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.215
Every time you speak,
just imagine this for a second,

20:19.260 --> 20:23.378
it's like dragging my balls
across shattered glass.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.547
- And it hurts.
- Well, for me,

20:27.393 --> 20:28.633
it's not your voice.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.558
It's your face.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.095
Your big, stupid face.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.810
Looking at it makes me feel

20:34.859 --> 20:38.727
like God is projectile vomiting
right in my eyes.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.940
And it burns.

20:42.700 --> 20:43.906
It really burns.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.486
What you gonna do now?
Throw a bit of furniture?

20:48.539 --> 20:51.226
For your information, I was gonna
take this chair and turn it sideways

20:51.250 --> 20:53.491
and shove it right down your throat.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.876
Of course you are,
'cause that's your answer to everything.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.833
Smash a hole through every problem
in a massive truck.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.819
- That's not gonna work here.
- I think it'll work fine.

21:00.843 --> 21:04.210
Guys, why don't you two take a seat
and we'll talk through this?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.637
Me and you? Us? I've been down this road.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.142
It's a total waste of time.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.665
For once, I couldn't agree with you more.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.304
Yeah? Well, I'm doing this my way.

21:16.150 --> 21:19.642
If anyone's got a problem with that,
I suggest you come out here and stop me.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.276
I'm not going in there.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.607
Well, I'm not going in there.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.272
Smart lads.

21:33.167 --> 21:37.376
All right, now that we got rid of
that fun sponge, we can get to work.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.288
I want you to pull up every CCTV camera
around central London.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.377
We already have two dozen agents
scouring footage.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.712
Don't you talk back to me, Opie. Uh-uh.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.602
I just care about the coverage.
I ain't gonna ask you again. Pull it up.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.925
Now zoom in on the area of the heist.

21:54.897 --> 21:58.765
Now invert it. Highlight the areas
that the cameras don't cover.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.647
She's smart.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.697
She just killed her entire team
and stole a deadly virus.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.608

He has everything ready for you

26:58.117 --> 27:01.405
in ourselves

27:02.871 --> 27:06.489
Humanity must evolve

27:20.222 --> 27:21.553
I'm gonna ask you a question.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.422
It's not what you think it is.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.174
Do you like to dance?

27:25.602 --> 27:27.342
What, the Electric Slide?

27:27.396 --> 27:29.762
The Macarena? No, I don't.

27:29.815 --> 27:33.182
No, no, no,
I was thinking about... the tango.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.977
- Where it takes two.
- Yeah, don't know that one.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.485
Must be different generations.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.318

Yeah, well, either way, the music started,
so let's see what kind of rhythm you have.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.767
- Where's the virus?
- Look, I told you,

27:47.791 --> 27:49.811
- I've no idea what you're talking about.
- Okay, that hurt.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.951
You just stepped on my toes,
that didn't feel good.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.982
Let's try it again.
I think you're better than that.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.167
- Where's the virus?
- I didn't ask to dance.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.976
And why should I talk to you?
You're not CIA.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.216
No? How do you know that?

27:59.261 --> 28:00.501
Where shall I start?

28:01.054 --> 28:03.716
There's two types of CIA agents.
Intelligence and espionage.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.577
Those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.162
That's what intelligence agents look like.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.302
You look like you could
pick up a building.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.137
But espionage is about blending in
and about being subtle,

28:12.191 --> 28:16.230
and there is nothing subtle about you.

28:16.612 --> 28:17.727
Yeah.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.360
That's good.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.068
- I'm impressed.
- I didn't kill anybody.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.232
I know you didn't.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.238
How do you know that, then?

28:26.288 --> 28:28.641
Because you can learn a lot about somebody
when you fight them.

28:28.665 --> 28:32.249
And when we fought,
you weren't fighting to kill me.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.830
You were fighting to run away.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.788
But either way, the world thinks that
you're a murderer and a thief,

28:37.841 --> 28:40.153
so you're not going anywhere
or getting any goddamn phone call

28:40.177 --> 28:41.529
until you give me some real answers.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.114
You have no idea what is happening here.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.699
- Then tell me. Help me understand.
- I can't.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.659
- You're wasting my time.
- I can't either... You're wasting time!

is the strongest muscle in the body.

we were teenagers,

and my old man
started coming around again.

Taking a real interest in his sons.

01:31:18.515 --> 01:31:20.972
The truth is,
he was just looking for a new crew.

And I was the only one
to see through those lies.

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:31.391
So the jobs my dad pulled
me and my brothers into

just got bigger and more dangerous.

and he was okay with,
getting me and my brothers killed.
