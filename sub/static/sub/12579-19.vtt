00:35.061 --> 00:37.962
Mail came a little early yesterday. 3:30.

00:38.164 --> 00:40.189
Yeah, Peggy was telling me.

00:41.034 --> 00:43.559
Gentlemen, you are looking
at the next winner...

00:43.670 --> 00:48.073
of the First Annual Durndle County
mower races, stock class.

00:48.441 --> 00:50.966
Mower races? Well, good for Durndle.

00:51.077 --> 00:54.672
Me and my Mason 5000 will do 20 laps
around the track...

00:54.781 --> 00:57.773
at speeds approaching 12 miles an hour.

00:57.884 --> 01:00.853
I've chosen you three to be my pit crew.

01:01.320 --> 01:06.280
Pit crew? Stuff that, mister.
If there's organized mower-racing, I'm in.

01:06.459 --> 01:09.087
- Me, too!
- Plan on eating my dust, Gribble.

01:09.195 --> 01:12.289
Fine. You're all fired from my pit crew.

01:12.398 --> 01:16.528
So unless you plan on buying
Mason 5000s between now and race day...

01:16.636 --> 01:21.266
and not having them
anonymously vandalized, plan on losing.

01:21.374 --> 01:25.037
Dale, it's the man, not the machine
that wins races.

01:25.144 --> 01:29.046
And I'll say this to you,
and to you, and to you:

01:29.482 --> 01:31.609
I am the man.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.899
You want to back out now?

01:53.005 --> 01:56.099
You mean back out of the race
or back out of this position?

01:56.209 --> 01:59.440
Because I can do both
but I will only do one.

02:04.484 --> 02:07.180
There's more where that came from.

02:16.162 --> 02:17.527
Oh, man.

02:18.231 --> 02:19.858
Not my back again.

02:25.238 --> 02:28.867
Mom, how come Dad gets to stand
at the breakfast table...

02:28.975 --> 02:31.239
and I never get to wear my cape?

02:31.344 --> 02:33.642
Because your father is afraid of doctors.

02:33.746 --> 02:35.839
Now, Hank, according to my count...

02:35.948 --> 02:39.577
this is the fifth or eighth time
that your back has gone out this year.

02:39.685 --> 02:41.414
Will you make an appointment already?

02:41.521 --> 02:45.457
No. My back's just stiff
from training for the mower race.

02:45.558 --> 02:48.823
I spent three hours last night
working on my starts.

02:49.095 --> 02:53.293
See, if I can beat Boomhauer off the line,
he'll fall apart mentally.

02:53.566 --> 02:57.127
What is it with you mower-racers
and your stubborn code of honor?

02:57.236 --> 02:59.727
I see a doctor
whenever I'm incapacitated...

02:59.839 --> 03:01.830
and it does not make me
any less of a man.

03:01.941 --> 03:05.536
I am not incapacitated. Enough said.

03:19.358 --> 03:21.826
There. Just take it. Take it all.

03:21.928 --> 03:24.453
I don't want any more junk food
in my house.

03:24.564 --> 03:27.158
- Bill, are the rats back?
- I don't know.

03:27.266 --> 03:31.168
I'm trying to lose weight so I have
a better chance in the mower race.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.500
Well, Bill, you could lose 100 pounds...

03:33.606 --> 03:36.268
and you still wouldn't be able
to take a corner like me.

03:36.375 --> 03:40.334
Well, I've got news for you.
I could never lose 100 pounds.

03:40.780 --> 03:44.341
And you haven't been practicing.
Your lawn is shaggy!

03:44.617 --> 03:47.450
You say something
about my lawn, Dauterive?

04:15.481 --> 04:17.642
- Thank you, Gina.
- Dr. Tate.

04:17.950 --> 04:18.974
Yes.

04:19.785 --> 04:23.744
Mr. Hill, you have a compression
of the discs in your lower back.

04:24.423 --> 04:27.620
Do you get a lot of this in your patients
who race mowers?

04:27.727 --> 04:30.059
A lawnmower didn't cause this,
it's genetic.

04:30.162 --> 04:32.824
- Genetic as in fatal?
- No.

04:33.199 --> 04:36.760
DR. TATE: Mr. Hill, you were born
with no muscle mass here...

04:36.869 --> 04:38.234
no cushioning.

04:38.337 --> 04:41.363
For years, you've basically been
sitting on your spine.

04:41.474 --> 04:45.808
You suffer from a disease called
Diminished Gluteal Syndrome or DGS.

04:47.113 --> 04:50.082
I don't understand. What does that mean?

04:50.349 --> 04:52.340
Mr. Hill, you have no ass.

05:02.028 --> 05:06.431
Diminished Gluteal Syndrome?
How could this happen to me?

05:06.532 --> 05:09.296
Let me show you something.
Gina, the chart.

05:09.402 --> 05:12.462
- Just a moment, Doctor.
- I'll just do it myself.

05:13.339 --> 05:16.206
This drawing shows
a healthy gluteus Maximus.

05:16.309 --> 05:18.243
Dr. TATE: You, have this body type.

05:18.344 --> 05:20.505
It's actually quite common in the suburbs.

05:20.613 --> 05:23.275
A white male with small buttocks
and protruding belly...

05:23.382 --> 05:26.408
often caused
by pronounced consumption of beer.

05:26.886 --> 05:29.582
My rear end isn't as flat as that guy's.

05:33.092 --> 05:36.061
I'm going to prescribe
a gluteal orthotic device.

05:36.162 --> 05:38.096
It's a prosthetic you wear
over your backside...

05:38.197 --> 05:40.324
to help alleviate the pressure
on your spine.

05:40.433 --> 05:43.266
You want me to wear a fake heinie?

05:43.436 --> 05:46.667
Mr. Hill, are your shoes fake feet?

05:50.476 --> 05:52.671
This is your gluteal orthotic.

05:53.379 --> 05:57.509
Let's see.
You wear it under your pants and...

05:57.984 --> 05:59.849
Well, that's about it.

06:02.822 --> 06:04.687
Let's see how she fits.

06:05.758 --> 06:08.022
Those two bags are filled with saline.

06:08.127 --> 06:12.086
Dr. Tate has prescribed 1,700 milliliters
for your left cheek...

06:12.198 --> 06:14.325
and 1,500 for your right.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.531
Isn't that interesting, Hank?

06:16.635 --> 06:20.594
You have one butt cheek
bigger than the other, just like my feet.

06:20.873 --> 06:22.898
HANK: Yeah, we're made for each other.

06:23.009 --> 06:27.241
I wear a size 16-and-a-half on my left foot,
16 on my right.

06:27.747 --> 06:29.578
How's that feel, Hank?

06:30.683 --> 06:32.275
Pretty good, I guess.

06:32.385 --> 06:35.354
Can you tell I've got something on
back there?

06:37.623 --> 06:39.147
No, not at all.

06:46.432 --> 06:48.491
Excuse me. I noticed...

06:49.168 --> 06:50.658
Are you a patient of Dr. Tate?

06:50.770 --> 06:51.998
- No.
- Yes.

06:52.605 --> 06:53.799
Me, too.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.208
Name's Dave. Dave Ulster.

06:56.308 --> 06:57.400
Hank.

06:58.177 --> 06:59.735
Hank Grill.

06:59.979 --> 07:03.312
It can be tough in the beginning.
If you, you know...

07:03.416 --> 07:06.010
you ever need to talk or anything,
give me a call.

07:06.118 --> 07:08.313
Well, thank you,
but this is a personal problem...

07:08.421 --> 07:11.390
that I am fully capable
of handling on my own.

07:11.490 --> 07:15.017
Well, Mr. D. Ulster at aol.com...

07:15.127 --> 07:17.595
get ready for Peggy Hill's joke of the day.

07:33.446 --> 07:34.936
I'll be dipped!

07:35.981 --> 07:40.111
Come on, Dad. Pedal to the metal.
Take small sips. Don't gulp.

07:40.619 --> 07:42.883
I'm mowing like I'm back in high school.

07:46.859 --> 07:48.793
Have you seen my orthotic?

07:48.894 --> 07:51.920
I need it for dinner.
My dad's gonna be here in 10 minutes.

07:52.031 --> 07:55.398
I was doing a load of support garments,
so I went ahead and threw it in.

07:55.501 --> 07:56.934
I hung it on the line to dry.

07:57.036 --> 08:00.767
It's "dry on a flat surface only!"
Didn't you read the tags?

08:08.147 --> 08:10.707
DALE: Over here, Hank. Behind you.

08:13.652 --> 08:16.485
You give that back before I kick your ass!

08:16.989 --> 08:19.719
Don't you mean before you kick your ass?

08:20.526 --> 08:24.485
That is a medical device
prescribed by an orthopedic physician.

08:26.065 --> 08:28.192
I'm here. Where's the steak?

08:29.702 --> 08:33.900
- Dad, go in the house. I'll be right in...
- Colonel, you saved me a phone call.

08:34.006 --> 08:37.407
I regret to inform you that your son
is wearing saline implants...

08:37.510 --> 08:39.808
i.e., falsies on his rump.

08:41.313 --> 08:45.272
Dear God, Hank.
You're wearing butt boobies.

08:45.384 --> 08:48.319
It's not for my buttocks, it's for my back.

08:48.420 --> 08:52.186
Didi, come over here.
Put your fake ta-ta's next to Hank's.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.918
We'll see who's got the bigger melons!

08:55.127 --> 08:58.654
All right, that tears it.
Dad, you give that to me right now!

08:58.764 --> 09:00.527
Keepaway from Hank!

09:00.666 --> 09:02.759
Pipe down, hillbillies!

09:02.935 --> 09:06.803
We're having a game of keepaway here,
Mr. Kahn.

09:07.740 --> 09:08.900
Catch.

09:29.428 --> 09:31.919
What information
have you brought me, Octavio?

09:32.031 --> 09:33.896
Bill is losing weight, jefe.

09:33.999 --> 09:35.864
He's eating only oranges
and ham sandwiches.

09:35.968 --> 09:40.029
Blast it! We will still win
but we must train twice as hard.

09:40.139 --> 09:42.664
Octavio, release the chicken.

09:47.346 --> 09:49.280
[Dale clucking]

09:49.381 --> 09:51.474
So that's the way it is.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.979
Hank, do not just stand there
watching Dale mow a chicken.

09:56.155 --> 10:00.251
Get your cheeks down off that line
and get yourself back in the race.

10:00.359 --> 10:03.920
No. I'm done with mower-racing.
And I'll tell you something else:

10:04.029 --> 10:07.226
I'm ripping up the grass
and putting in wood chips.

10:07.333 --> 10:10.097
You know how I always hated
having a lawn.

10:17.076 --> 10:18.771
Hank, Mr. Strickland just called.

10:18.877 --> 10:21.607
There is a propane emergency
out in McMaynerbury.

10:21.714 --> 10:24.649
McMaynerbury? When will they learn?

10:26.285 --> 10:29.413
No, no. Hop in.
With your bad back, I will drive.

10:38.631 --> 10:39.757
Hello?

10:39.865 --> 10:43.392
Hank Hill, Strickland Propane.
Do not light any matches.

10:43.502 --> 10:45.333
DAVE: We're back here, Hank.

10:47.373 --> 10:48.806
Remember me, Hank?

10:48.907 --> 10:52.673
Dave Ulster from the medical supply shop.
You're among friends.

10:52.778 --> 10:55.770
All of us suffer from
Diminished Gluteal Syndrome.

10:55.881 --> 10:59.442
But Peggy said there was a propane...
Oh, no.

11:07.359 --> 11:11.022
Hank, my name is Wayne.
And I've been wearing for four years.

11:11.130 --> 11:13.223
Phil. Six-and-a-half years.

11:13.365 --> 11:16.926
I'm Larry. I've worn a prosthetic behind
for 18 months.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.866
Oh, God! This is a support group.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.339
We are not a support group.
We're hobbyists.

11:23.442 --> 11:26.411
We share a similar interest
and meet twice a month to talk about it.

11:26.512 --> 11:28.980
I can't believe this is happening to me.

11:29.081 --> 11:32.949
Your wife told me about the awful incident
with your orthotic.

11:33.052 --> 11:36.283
- I shared it with the group.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

11:36.388 --> 11:39.016
I am not even confirming
that I have a wife.

11:39.124 --> 11:43.754
It's one thing when they call us names.
But to play hot potato with your unit!

11:43.862 --> 11:46.797
For God's sakes! It's a medical device.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.728
That's what I kept saying.

11:48.834 --> 11:52.201
Those cruel sons of britches.
Did you get their names?

11:52.338 --> 11:53.965
I know their names.

11:54.073 --> 11:57.304
They were my neighbors,
and my best friends, and...

11:58.711 --> 11:59.871
my dad.

12:00.379 --> 12:03.177
Hank, none of what's said here
leaves the group.

12:03.282 --> 12:05.910
So, anybody sit anywhere good this week?

12:06.018 --> 12:09.078
WAYNE: Guess which assistant coach sat
on his son's Little League bench?

12:09.188 --> 12:10.621
DAVE: Nice.
LARRY: That's great.

12:22.735 --> 12:26.262
Peggy, you better sit down,
I have something to show you.

12:31.610 --> 12:35.706
That's right. I'm sitting.
And I owe it all to that hobbyist group.

12:35.814 --> 12:39.045
And the one person
who put me in touch with them...

12:39.852 --> 12:41.217
Dave Ulster.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.515
I'm kidding you, Peggy.
See? I got my sense of humor back.

12:49.194 --> 12:51.594
Hank, it is good to laugh again.

12:54.466 --> 12:56.366
But on a serious note, Peggy...

12:56.468 --> 12:59.631
don't ever report a false
propane emergency again.

13:00.139 --> 13:02.607
Believe me, I prayed on it, Hank...

13:02.841 --> 13:05.469
and God said to me, "Don't do it."

13:05.711 --> 13:07.872
But you know what? I knew better.

13:07.980 --> 13:11.074
I was not gonna rest
until you were back in that mower race.

13:11.183 --> 13:13.777
The race? I'm done with that nonsense.

13:13.986 --> 13:17.046
I'll wear my orthotic at home
and at my desk at work...

13:17.156 --> 13:20.922
but I'm not gonna give my so-called
friends and family an opportunity...

13:21.026 --> 13:22.994
to ridicule me in public.

13:25.431 --> 13:28.093
INSTRUCTOR: Squeeze your butt
and release your butt.

13:30.436 --> 13:33.837
And walk on your butt,
and left cheek, right cheek...

13:34.273 --> 13:35.399
Bobby!

13:35.607 --> 13:38.337
That's a ladies tape. What are you doing?

13:38.444 --> 13:42.380
I'm firming my buttocks in 30 days
so I don't end up like you.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.139
You know how much I like to sit.

13:45.350 --> 13:48.786
Don't worry, Son.
You probably won't get DGS.

13:48.921 --> 13:52.118
But even if you do,
you can wear a gluteal orthotic...

13:52.224 --> 13:53.691
and sit anywhere you want.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.455
Yeah, but sooner or later
someone will find out.

13:57.563 --> 13:58.860
And they'll laugh.

13:58.964 --> 14:03.264
And I want people laughing at me
'cause I'm shoving broccoli up my nose...

14:03.368 --> 14:06.235
not because there's something wrong
with me.

14:07.272 --> 14:09.968
INSTRUCTOR: Left cheek, right cheek...

14:10.542 --> 14:12.635
DAVE: So, Hank, I see
you're sitting this week.

14:12.744 --> 14:13.972
Yes, I am.

14:14.179 --> 14:17.376
But I'd like to stand up
for what I'm about to say.

14:17.483 --> 14:20.316
I want to thank you all
for giving me the courage...

14:20.419 --> 14:22.683
to wear my orthotic with pride.

14:23.155 --> 14:26.955
And dang it, I'm not just doing it for me.

14:27.192 --> 14:28.989
I'm doing it for my son...

14:29.094 --> 14:33.622
because chances are I've passed
this debilitating condition on to him.

14:33.999 --> 14:38.732
And there is one thing I can do to help
my son lead a happy, shame-free life.

14:39.037 --> 14:42.438
And that's to win
the Durndle County Lawnmower Race.

14:42.541 --> 14:44.805
- All right, Hank.
- Way to go, Hank.

14:44.910 --> 14:49.210
I knew y'all would be on board.
I'm gonna need an ace pit crew...

14:49.314 --> 14:53.148
and I'm looking at one right now.
We're an unbeatable team!

14:53.619 --> 14:55.450
The Diminished Glutes!

14:55.888 --> 14:58.448
We'll wear it on our hats, on our jackets.

14:58.557 --> 15:02.584
Heck, I'll paint it on my mower.
Right on top of the factory coat.

15:04.563 --> 15:07.123
You do that, we'll throw a brick
through your window.

15:07.232 --> 15:10.429
What the...
I thought we were an unbeatable team.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.226
Take a seat, Hank.

15:12.337 --> 15:15.966
We're a secret society,
not a group of Look-At-Me-Stanleys.

15:16.074 --> 15:19.669
Well, fine. If that's the way it is,
I'll do it on my own.

15:20.612 --> 15:23.308
Thank you, Hank. Any other new business?

15:35.627 --> 15:40.257
Hank, painting "Diminished Glutes" on
your mower might be asking for trouble.

15:40.465 --> 15:44.265
What about my suggestion to paint
"The Mow the Merrier?"

15:45.671 --> 15:49.402
I suffer from a genetic condition
called DGS.

15:49.908 --> 15:53.844
I'm sorry, Hank. It's just that
I don't know what it's like.

15:54.112 --> 15:57.548
Because obviously, I have got it
going on back there.

15:57.649 --> 16:00.243
God forbid in 20 years Bobby gets it.

16:00.352 --> 16:05.051
I don't want him to feel like a freak.
I'm fighting now so he doesn't have to.

16:05.190 --> 16:06.817
Race for the cure.

16:08.427 --> 16:09.394
ANNOUNCER: Good afternoon.

16:09.494 --> 16:11.587
The United States
Lawnmower Racing Association...

16:11.697 --> 16:14.530
welcomes you to
the Durndle County Speedway.

16:14.666 --> 16:19.000
Our day begins with the lightning speed
of the drag races.

16:29.114 --> 16:32.845
Look at Dale over there,
all smug on his Mason 5000.

16:33.251 --> 16:36.049
You're gonna eat my exhaust fumes,
Gribble.

16:36.154 --> 16:39.555
- Keep talking, bubble-butt.
- I wasn't saying anything.

16:39.658 --> 16:41.421
Not you. I was talking to Hank.

16:41.526 --> 16:44.723
I'm gonna mow laps around both of you!

16:46.064 --> 16:48.532
ANNOUNCER: Stock class racers,
mount your mowers.

16:48.634 --> 16:51.603
The race will begin in one minute!

16:53.205 --> 16:54.604
All right, Octavio.

16:54.706 --> 16:58.608
Now that the inspection is over,
hook up the nitrous oxide to my engine.

16:58.710 --> 16:59.768
That's illegal, no?

16:59.878 --> 17:02.506
Yes. But it'll give me a boost of speed.

17:02.614 --> 17:05.446
Add that to the natural quickness
of the Mason 5000...

17:05.550 --> 17:09.041
and I just might overcome
my weak driving skills.

17:09.154 --> 17:12.817
ANNOUNCER: Racers, start your engines!

17:21.967 --> 17:24.401
And ready, set...

17:25.604 --> 17:26.662
mow!

17:31.009 --> 17:33.500
I did better than I thought I would.

17:33.612 --> 17:36.479
[Upbeat '70s pop music]

17:36.581 --> 17:38.981
Don't you clip my wheels, you little tush.

17:39.084 --> 17:41.644
Say that again to the back of my head...

17:41.787 --> 17:45.484
Mr. Non-U.S. Lawnmower
Association Approved Helmet.

17:56.968 --> 18:00.961
ANNOUNCER: Ten laps down,
ten laps to mow!

18:04.609 --> 18:06.509
He blew out his left cheek!

18:06.611 --> 18:10.672
No. That's his pivot cheek.
Now he can't turn to the inside.

18:23.995 --> 18:27.158
Hank, I just wanna say I'm proud of you.

18:27.332 --> 18:29.596
May the best man win.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.236
Not the other one.

18:44.282 --> 18:45.977
My cheeks blew out.

18:46.618 --> 18:49.985
I'm riding on my tailbone.
I don't think I can finish.

18:50.088 --> 18:53.057
Yes, you can.
There's less than one lap to go.

18:53.158 --> 18:54.523
Gut it out.

18:55.660 --> 18:58.629
Cramp! Gut it out!

19:00.031 --> 19:02.625
Watch out. I'm pulling off the track.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.639
DAVE AND LARRY:
We're here! No rear! Get used to it!

19:11.543 --> 19:15.206
We're here! No rear! Get used to it!

19:16.348 --> 19:18.475
Hank, take my ass.

19:38.003 --> 19:41.769
ANNOUNCER: And the winner of the First
Annual Durndle County Mower Race...

19:41.873 --> 19:44.706
is Boomhauer!

19:45.110 --> 19:46.577
Damn, we lost.

19:47.078 --> 19:49.603
You worthless piece of junk.

19:51.016 --> 19:54.349
But I can still beat Hank.
That's even better than winning.

19:54.452 --> 19:56.784
Come on, you graceful gazelle.

20:00.725 --> 20:03.694
Dang cheating Octavio blew my engine!

20:03.795 --> 20:06.195
ANNOUNCER: Dale Gribble
on the Mason 5000.

20:06.298 --> 20:08.858
Hank Hill on the Diminished
Gluteal Syndrome mower!

20:08.967 --> 20:12.027
What a battle for sixth place!

20:13.438 --> 20:17.499
Celebrate good times, come on!
Sixth place!

20:30.856 --> 20:34.121
Well, I'm sorry I let you down
by not winning the race.

20:34.226 --> 20:37.423
Hank, what you did, it took a lot of guts.

20:37.863 --> 20:41.799
You got seventh place. That means you
automatically qualify for next year's race.

20:41.900 --> 20:45.165
Well, I appreciate what you guys did
out there today, too.

20:45.270 --> 20:48.569
That also took a lot of guts.
Especially you, Larry.

20:48.707 --> 20:52.939
We were all reaching for our bags, buddy.
I was just quickest on the draw.

20:53.078 --> 20:56.570
All right, then.
I guess I'll see you guys next Tuesday.

21:09.761 --> 21:13.094
She's a beaut. What kind of engine?
Briggs and Stratton?

21:13.198 --> 21:16.224
Tecumseh.
Ten-and-a-half horse under the hood.

21:20.438 --> 21:23.805
That padding, that thing you were
wearing during the race...

21:23.909 --> 21:27.037
I got a friend
who could use something like that.

21:28.613 --> 21:31.514
Well, why don't you give your friend
my card?

21:37.589 --> 21:40.649
Excuse me. I think you could use it, too.

21:42.127 --> 21:44.789
Peggy, to the medical supply store.

21:45.463 --> 21:47.328
I need some new cheeks.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.530
DR. TATE: Thank you, Gina.
GINA: Dr. Tate.
