<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:17.726 --> 00:20.353
<i>How, what, where, why?</i>
<i>What, where, why?</i>

00:20.437 --> 00:22.856
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:22.939 --> 00:25.859
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:25.942 --> 00:28.486
<i>Under here, over there</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:30.989
<i>Science is everywhere you look</i>

00:31.072 --> 00:33.742
<i>With Iggy Peck, architect</i>

00:33.825 --> 00:36.453
<i>And Rosie Revere, engineer</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:39.122
<i>So much to do and you can help too!</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:42.000
<i>A mystery, a riddle, a puzzle or a quest</i>

00:42.083 --> 00:45.128
<i>There are wonders to discover</i>
<i>And hypotheses to test</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:46.546
<i>Science is the best!</i>

00:46.629 --> 00:49.132
<i>Ada Twist, scientist</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:51.926
<i>She’s gonna find out what the answer is</i>

00:52.010 --> 00:56.222
<i>Everywhere science is</i>
<i>She’s forming a hypothesis</i>

00:56.306 --> 00:59.601
<i>Connecting all the dots</i>
<i>’Cause this is Scientist Ada Twist!</i>

01:07.692 --> 01:10.653
-Hi, Mama!
-Morning, hon. You ready for pancakes?

01:11.696 --> 01:14.199
Can you make them perfectly round?

01:14.282 --> 01:15.366
I guess we’ll see.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.373
Why do people kiss?

01:22.457 --> 01:26.294
-That’s what I’m saying.
-Ask your mum. Got to go to work.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.963
Can’t wait to see
what you got planned for tonight.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.550
-I know it’s going to be good.
-What I planned for tonight?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.762
Ada, Arthur, cereal, eggs, please.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.473
-I’ll get the eggs.
-I’ll get the cereal.

01:38.973 --> 01:42.227
Hey, this cereal
has heart-shaped sweets in it.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.815
The eggs have lovey eyes on them.

01:50.026 --> 01:54.239
And the cat gave me peonies,
my favourite flowers. Thanks, Mooshu!

01:54.989 --> 01:57.158
Lovey eyes? Heart-shaped cereal?

01:57.742 --> 02:02.372
Peonies? Oh no! I forgot our anniversary!

02:03.248 --> 02:05.083
Mum, the pancakes!

02:07.502 --> 02:09.712
That is not a perfect circle.

02:11.005 --> 02:14.509
-Mum, do you know what you just made?
-A mess?

02:14.592 --> 02:18.012
A unicorn! In science,
this is called a happy accident.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.641
When you try to make one thing
but accidentally make something better.

02:21.724 --> 02:26.146
That’s lovely. Forgetting our anniversary
though, that’s not a happy accident.

02:26.229 --> 02:30.358
Anniversaries are for showing love.
And I forgot.

02:30.441 --> 02:33.695
I can’t plan something now.
I have a big project due for work.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.072
Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll find a way to help.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.242
So, what do you think?

02:39.325 --> 02:43.288
I think I love this unicorn pancake.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.790
About my parents’ anniversary?

02:45.874 --> 02:48.918
Oh, right. ’Fraid I got nothing.

02:49.544 --> 02:54.090
Me too. We’ll help you with anything, Ada.
but my parents don’t live together…

02:56.217 --> 02:58.219
so anniversaries aren’t my specialty.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.513
Know what we need? A brainstorm.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.891
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

03:02.974 --> 03:06.102
<i>Throw in every thought you had</i>
<i>No idea is ever bad</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:08.813
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

03:08.897 --> 03:11.858
<i>Gather up your friends</i>
<i>Try to find the how, the what, the why</i>

03:11.941 --> 03:14.444
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

03:14.527 --> 03:19.115
<i>Let our imaginations</i>
<i>Become great new creations</i>

03:19.199 --> 03:23.036
<i>When we brainstorm, brainstorm</i>
<i>Brainstorm, brainstorm</i>

03:23.119 --> 03:24.078
<i>Hey!</i>

03:24.662 --> 03:28.333
I have an idea. We could make the house
and everything in it red.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.876
The colour of love!

03:29.959 --> 03:34.088
Yeah, sure. But also the colour of Mars.
My dad loves Mars.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.633
But then everything will be red forever.

03:36.716 --> 03:37.675
The furniture…

03:37.759 --> 03:40.845
And Mum, Dad, Arthur and me.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.555
And I like being Black.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.265
I have an idea.

03:44.349 --> 03:48.019
Your mum could fly
up to your dad’s bookstore on a dragon,

03:48.102 --> 03:52.941
carrying a sweet new harp
and sing a love song.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.693
My dad loves all kinds of instruments,

03:55.777 --> 04:00.198
but where’d we get a dragon with a harp
at short notice?

04:00.281 --> 04:01.241
Excellent point.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.119
What if we made a house out of chocolate
for your dad?

04:05.203 --> 04:08.373
It would be chocolatey amazingness. Wow.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.499
That’s it!

04:09.582 --> 04:11.751
Really? We’re going to build
a chocolate house?

04:11.834 --> 04:17.048
No! That would take way too much time
and way too much chocolate.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.717
-Can there be too much chocolate?
-Nope.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.220
What I meant was

04:22.303 --> 04:26.224
Dad always bakes us this Chocolate
Surprise Cake on special occasions,

04:26.307 --> 04:27.684
so we’ll bake it for him.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.852
-Awesome!
-Fabulous idea!

04:30.812 --> 04:34.065
I love the idea
of making his Chocolate Surprise Cake.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.359
There’s only one problem.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.237
It’s an old family recipe
that only Dad knows.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.531
-No one ever wrote it down.
-Oh, man.

04:41.614 --> 04:42.657
-Really?
-Good try.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.785
Wait, we can figure out
the recipe in the lab.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.453
Baking is science.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.707
My mum always says cooking is an art,
but baking is a science.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.375
She’d know. She’s a chef.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.878
Okay, while you three
figure out the recipe,

04:55.962 --> 04:59.173
I’ll try and find a backup gift
just in case.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.467
Don’t worry, Mum. We’ve got this.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.387
What would I do
without my little scientist?

05:04.470 --> 05:08.683
You wouldn’t have an anniversary gift,
and that would be bad.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.728
Loading the lab.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.363
When I bake with my dad,

05:22.447 --> 05:26.826
he says his Chocolate Surprise Cake
has to be sweet, soft and tall.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.913
Sugar and chocolate make it sweet.
To make it soft, we need--

05:30.997 --> 05:32.165
Pillows!

05:32.915 --> 05:34.125
Nope. Butter.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.626
And for tallness--

05:35.710 --> 05:36.961
Building blocks!

05:37.754 --> 05:38.838
Baking powder.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.842
-That’ll work too.
-And it will taste better.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.969
And finally, sprinkles on top.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.724
Now what’s missing are eggs and flour
to hold it all together.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.357
I think I found a gift.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.151
Oh, Mum.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.361
-A tie?
-A tie?

06:01.444 --> 06:05.740
-I think he already has that tie.
-I think that is his tie.

06:05.823 --> 06:09.035
Okay, I’ll dig around again
after I get some work done.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.247
We’d better make this work.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.961
It’s done.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.925
It’s a tower of cake.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.178
Dad’s cake is never this tall.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.429
Don’t drop it.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.390
It’s wobbling! I can’t look!

06:33.893 --> 06:35.853
Let’s see if it’s done.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.314
-Duck!
-Look out!

06:38.398 --> 06:40.441
Oh, man, I got caked.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.860
We need to rethink this recipe.

06:43.945 --> 06:48.366
If baking powder makes the cake tall,
maybe there was too much.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.702
I’d guesstimate that we need exactly…

06:51.786 --> 06:53.955
a lot less this time.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.674
-It’s looking good.
-Really good.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.883
Perfect!

07:07.343 --> 07:08.845
It’s not perfect.

07:08.928 --> 07:13.349
It sunk. Just like our hopes and dreams.

07:14.725 --> 07:18.563
And if a tie my dad already owns
is all Mum can come up with,

07:19.188 --> 07:20.565
we should just give up.

07:20.648 --> 07:25.278
I wanted to help Mum show Dad
how much she loves him, but I failed.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.321
And we can’t fix it.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.825
Ada Twist,
I may not know a lot about anniversaries,

07:30.908 --> 07:33.661
but I know about not giving up,
and so do you.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.789
Yeah. We just need to keep trying.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.543
You’re right.
We’re scientists. We don’t give up.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.086
This is too important.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.089
I just wish we knew
what we were doing wrong.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.425
Oops. Sorry.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.888
Rosie, what you just did…
I know what to do.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.764
Watch this.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.851
That’s what I did. Is that good?

07:56.934 --> 08:01.230
Yes. It shows the chemical reaction.
Watch this.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.610
-It didn’t overflow that time.
-Exactly.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.362
I forgot the other thing
my dad always says.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.157
“Measure twice, bake once.”

08:11.240 --> 08:13.326
Baking is science, right?

08:13.409 --> 08:16.996
We need the right chemical reaction
to make the cake perfect.

08:17.079 --> 08:20.541
We had the right ingredients,
but not the right amounts.

08:20.625 --> 08:24.462
Come on, let’s try again.
Fast. Dad’s coming home soon.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.516
Okay, all the ingredients are in.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.059
Plus love.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.770
Dad says that makes it extra sweet.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.230
I hope it works.

08:43.189 --> 08:47.568
-It actually looks like a real cake.
-It’s tall, but not too tall.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.488
Soft, but not sunken.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.822
-Yum.
-Tastes delish.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.283
And it’s chocolatey and sweet.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.451
-Yay!
-Yay!

08:57.828 --> 08:59.038
Wait, listen.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.041
Why is it crunchy?

09:04.168 --> 09:08.381
Sprinkles? Dad’s Chocolate Surprise Cake
doesn’t have sprinkles inside.

09:08.464 --> 09:12.134
It’s supposed to have sprinkles
on the outside. This is a disaster.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.763
Sprinkles are never a disaster.

09:15.846 --> 09:20.184
But it’s not Dad’s cake.
It’s not perfect. We have to remake it.

09:20.268 --> 09:24.981
We can’t. Dad’s coming home soon.
Maybe Mum’s got a good gift?

09:25.064 --> 09:28.067
How about this? I painted the Milky Way.

09:28.150 --> 09:31.571
Here’s Orion’s Belt,
the Big Dipper, Polaris.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.910
Oh, you’re right.
It’s like a star exploded.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.539
It’s a mess and a half.
How’s the cake coming?

09:41.622 --> 09:46.627
We accidentally got sprinkles inside,
so it’s not Dad’s Chocolate Surprise Cake.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.088
No, but it’s your Surprise Cake.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.549
You made the cake plus a surprise.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.135
Sounds like a happy accident to me.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.638
-I love when that happens.
-Yeah. Like my unicorn pancakes.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.474
-Come on, let’s get it on the table.
-Okay.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.642
We’ll help.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.520
Then we’ve got to go home.
You’ve got this, Ada.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.730
Thank you, guys.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.152
What do we have here?

10:11.235 --> 10:13.070
Please be seated, Mr Dad.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.989
I mean, Mr Twist.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.949
Happy anniversary!

10:17.825 --> 10:21.454
Tonight, we have for you…
Drumroll, please.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.041
Dad’s Chocolate Surprise Cake!

10:25.124 --> 10:28.085
Really? But the recipe
isn’t even written down.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.884
This isn’t my Chocolate Surprise Cake.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.135
Knew it.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.845
It’s better.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.892
-Really?
-Yes. Sprinkles inside the cake? Genius.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.311
Your daughter outdid herself, as usual.

10:45.394 --> 10:49.273
It was a happy accident.
Plus I added a special ingredient.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.441
Love.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.318
I can taste the love.

10:52.401 --> 10:56.364
This is the most delicious anniversary
present I’ve ever eaten. Thank you!

10:58.824 --> 11:01.243
I’ll allow the kiss. This time.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.750
Wow. An exploding star.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.543
Well, it was supposed to be…

11:09.627 --> 11:12.755
Never mind. Yep.
That’s exactly what it is.

11:20.012 --> 11:24.141
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

11:29.605 --> 11:32.817
Hi, I’m Lasheeda Perry
and I am a pastry chef.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.568
Today, we are going to talk about

11:34.652 --> 11:39.240
how baking soda plays
a very scientific role in baked goods,

11:39.323 --> 11:40.783
specifically cookies.

11:40.866 --> 11:41.826
<i>Yum!</i>

11:42.326 --> 11:45.454
As a pastry chef,
we are always thinking about,

11:45.538 --> 11:48.290
“If I put this ingredient
with that ingredient,

11:48.374 --> 11:50.751
what reaction am I going to get?”

11:50.835 --> 11:55.005
I want to show you today
what baking soda does to baked goods.

11:55.089 --> 11:58.050
-Shall we make our chocolate-chip cookies?
<i>-Let’s go!</i>

11:58.134 --> 12:04.515
Baking soda has been used for many years,
because it helps leaven your baked good.

12:04.598 --> 12:08.227
Leavening means to help your product rise.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.145
<i>Cool.</i>

12:09.228 --> 12:12.982
I’ve played with different recipes
where I use a little bit of baking soda,

12:13.065 --> 12:16.402
and then I use a lot,
and I had a completely different product.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.446
And there goes our timer.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.118
On the right, here,

12:24.201 --> 12:27.872
are chocolate-chip cookies
with baking soda.

12:27.955 --> 12:31.125
And over here is without baking soda.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.170
And the most obvious difference
is the colour.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.172
These are nice and golden.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.467
Here, the centres are still pretty pale.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.844
The spreading is different as well.

12:41.927 --> 12:45.347
With the baking soda,
it has a nice thick edge,

12:45.431 --> 12:50.019
and more uniform
compared to the rustic edges

12:50.102 --> 12:53.856
where they’re just doing
their own little thing.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.524
Now this is the fun part.

12:55.608 --> 12:59.945
This is really why I love being
a pastry chef, because I get to taste it!

13:03.073 --> 13:04.366
That is so good.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.410
Fun fact!

13:07.077 --> 13:11.582
Baking soda is not only used
in baked goods such as cookies

13:11.665 --> 13:14.919
but it’s also used in fire extinguishers.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.343
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!

13:29.892 --> 13:33.354
Rosie Rule number seven.
Always ring three times for good luck.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.355
-Hey, Iggy.
-Hi.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.564
Hi, Ada. Hi, Rosie.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.275
Let’s get this garden party started.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.443
Yeah, about that--

13:39.527 --> 13:42.446
-I love gardens and parties.
-I don’t think we can have a--

13:42.530 --> 13:47.743
I’m so excited to spend all afternoon
in your beautiful…

13:47.827 --> 13:49.703
-Yikes!
-Sweet zucchini!

13:49.787 --> 13:51.872
That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.875
I invited you over for a garden party,
but look!

13:55.376 --> 13:56.585
Okay.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.379
Are these plants sad?

13:58.462 --> 14:01.882
-Or sleepy?
-They’re just not very healthy right now.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.803
My dad used to take care of them.
Since he moved, he hasn’t been able to.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.763
Maybe they need to laugh.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.391
My mum always says
laughter is the best medicine.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.560
Why are potatoes good detectives?

14:12.643 --> 14:14.937
Because they keep their eyes peeled.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.606
Good one, Rosie.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.278
Really? Not even a little leaf-wiggle?
Tough crowd.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.239
-Hey there, team. Who’s hungry?
-Devilled eggs!

14:25.322 --> 14:27.199
Yum! Thanks!

14:27.283 --> 14:30.786
So what are you kids up to today?
Tell me all the fun plans.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.539
We were going to have a garden party, but…

14:33.622 --> 14:37.710
I know, this garden doesn’t exactly
give off a party vibe, does it?

14:37.793 --> 14:38.961
Not really.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.797
But these devilled eggs are egg-cellent!

14:42.840 --> 14:44.133
Get it? ’Cause they’re eggs.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.553
I’m glad you like them
’cause they’re going on the café menu.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.014
This rosemary
would’ve made them even more delish,

14:50.097 --> 14:51.807
but I just don’t have a green thumb.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.685
That’s ’cause only ogres do.
And some elves.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.064
No, Rosie. Having a green thumb
means you’re good at gardening.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.816
Oh! That makes more sense.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.568
I wish I was better at gardening.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.779
But with running the café
and being classroom mum at school,

15:05.863 --> 15:07.448
I don’t have the time.

15:07.531 --> 15:11.076
If only there was a button I could press
to take care of my plants.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.203
That’s the quiche. Gotta run.

15:13.287 --> 15:17.207
My mum may not have a green thumb,
but she loves this garden.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.753
-I wish I could make it nice for her.
-Iggy, we’re scientists.

15:20.836 --> 15:23.839
-And your best friends. We’ll help you.
-We’ve got your back.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.967
Really? Thanks! So what do we do now?

15:27.051 --> 15:32.723
Well, first we’ve got to examine
this garden really close.

15:32.806 --> 15:36.936
I’ve got an observation.
The leaves are droopy and yellowy.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.189
The plants over here are even droopier
and yellowier!

15:40.940 --> 15:45.819
The plants in the shade are droopier
than the ones in the sun. Fascinating.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.824
Excuse me. Dry dirt makes me sneeze.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.618
Great observation, Iggy.

15:52.701 --> 15:56.038
If the soil’s dry, it could mean
the plants haven’t been watered lately.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.706
I think we have a hypothesis.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.794
I love a hypersomesis…

16:01.877 --> 16:04.129
Hypothstimsa…

16:04.797 --> 16:06.632
Why is that word so hard to say?

16:06.715 --> 16:07.883
I’ll help you out.

16:07.967 --> 16:13.138
<i>I’ve got a hypothesis</i>
<i>I’ve got a hypothesis</i>

16:13.806 --> 16:15.182
<i>Does that observation</i>

16:15.265 --> 16:16.642
<i>Mean this explanation?</i>

16:16.725 --> 16:19.812
<i>Right or wrong</i>
<i>Let’s find out what the answer is</i>

16:20.396 --> 16:23.148
<i>It might not be right</i>
<i>But we’re going to find out</i>

16:23.232 --> 16:25.734
<i>What this theory is all about</i>

16:25.818 --> 16:28.278
<i>An educated guess</i>
<i>But will it stand up to our test?</i>

16:28.362 --> 16:30.364
<i>Yes, that’s what a hypothesis is</i>

16:30.447 --> 16:36.161
<i>I’ve got a hypothesis</i>
<i>I’ve got a hypothesis</i>

16:36.245 --> 16:39.415
<i>Let’s find out how right it is</i>

16:39.498 --> 16:40.666
<i>Let’s go!</i>

16:40.749 --> 16:45.379
So our hypothesis is plants need
sunlight and water to be healthy.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.173
We should test it out. Loading the lab.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.809
Test subject is ready.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.769
Cue the sun, Rosie.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.605
Or if you want to be
scientifically accurate,

17:03.689 --> 17:07.735
a special gardening bulb
whose light is like the sun’s.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.195
It’s getting less yellowy.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.280
And more green-y.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.324
-I mean, greener.
-All because of the sun?

17:15.325 --> 17:16.618
I have so much power.

17:16.702 --> 17:21.081
We just proved the first part
of our hypothesis. Plants need sun.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.500
Ada, the sun’s really heavy.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.086
I wonder how heavy the real sun is.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.005
Ada!

17:28.088 --> 17:30.924
Oh, right. You can put
the light down now, Rosie.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.927
Now on to test number two.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.764
Iggy, release the rain.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.100
Or if you want to get
scientifically specific, a bucket of--

17:40.184 --> 17:41.268
Iggy!

17:42.352 --> 17:43.353
Water.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.772
Whoops. Sorry.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.900
It’s okay. I love the rain.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.070
And puddles! Yeah!

17:53.572 --> 17:55.491
The droopiness is all gone.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.911
Which means we proved
part two of our hypothesis.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.496
Plants need water.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.165
Now let’s take our findings
back to the garden.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.877
First, we’ve got to move that umbrella
so those plants get more sun.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.712
And give them water.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.426
Nice landing.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.472
It worked. Go, sun!

18:18.555 --> 18:21.517
Now all they need is a little of this.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.228
Hey, I’m not sneezing.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.355
That must mean
the soil isn’t dry any more.

18:26.438 --> 18:30.400
Come on, little plantipoos. You can do it.

18:31.151 --> 18:34.947
We gave them sunlight and water,
so why are they still droopy?

18:35.030 --> 18:38.575
-What are we missing?
-Maybe more jokes. I got one.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.870
Which vegetable
loves hanging out with animals?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.539
A zucchini.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.916
Get it? Zoo-cchini?

18:46.500 --> 18:47.751
Another good one.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.964
The plants don’t think so.
I’ll keep working on my jokes.

18:52.047 --> 18:55.551
What we really need is a plant expert.
I wish we knew one.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.262
-Wait. I know a plant expert.
-You do?

19:01.640 --> 19:02.808
Oh, hi, Dad!

19:02.891 --> 19:04.685
<i>Hey, Iggster. What’s up, bud?</i>

19:05.394 --> 19:08.021
<i>Look, the three musketeers are all here.</i>

19:08.105 --> 19:09.273
-Hi, Mr Peck.
-Hello.

19:09.356 --> 19:13.152
We’re trying to help Mum’s garden.
You’re the best plant expert I know.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.363
We gave them water and sun,
but they still look sick. Help!

19:16.446 --> 19:20.200
<i>Okay, calm down. I’m gonna help ya.</i>
<i>Did you do the plant dance?</i>

19:20.284 --> 19:22.161
The plant dance?

19:22.244 --> 19:23.579
<i>The silly wiggle.</i>

19:24.788 --> 19:27.207
-Oh yeah!
-Oh yeah!

19:29.126 --> 19:30.711
-It didn’t work.
<i>-Yeah, I know.</i>

19:30.794 --> 19:33.797
<i>I just wanted to loosen you guys up.</i>
<i>You look kind of serious.</i>

19:35.132 --> 19:37.551
<i>What you actually need is fertiliser.</i>

19:37.634 --> 19:39.052
Ferti-whater?

19:39.136 --> 19:43.599
<i>Fertiliser. It’s like vitamins for plants.</i>
<i>You take them to stay strong and healthy.</i>

19:44.183 --> 19:45.225
-You sure do!
-Yep.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.687
<i>Plants need vitamins too,</i>
<i>but they get theirs from the soil.</i>

19:48.770 --> 19:50.981
<i>Adding fertiliser helps keep them healthy.</i>

19:51.064 --> 19:52.316
Of course!

19:52.399 --> 19:53.942
<i>And you can make your own.</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:57.905
<i>You just need natural stuff that has lots</i>
<i>of nutrients. Want me to tell you how?</i>

19:57.988 --> 20:00.157
-Yes!
-Absolutely!

20:11.793 --> 20:14.004
<i>Great. Once the natural ingredients</i>

20:14.087 --> 20:17.424
<i>are all smooshed up into something</i>
<i>that looks like gooey dirt,</i>

20:17.507 --> 20:19.051
<i>you’ve got fertiliser.</i>

20:19.134 --> 20:21.303
<i>All you’ve got to do</i>
<i>is sprinkle it on the soil.</i>

20:21.386 --> 20:23.222
-Thanks, Mr Peck.
<i>-</i>You rock, Mr P.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.514
<i>Anytime, kiddos.</i>

20:24.598 --> 20:25.557
Thanks, Dad.

20:27.351 --> 20:30.646
Fertiliser’s squishy and kind of gross.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.856
I love it!

20:32.940 --> 20:34.816
Time to take your vitamins, plants.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.615
Wow, we did it.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.866
Awesome possum!

20:42.950 --> 20:44.201
Possums? Where?

20:44.284 --> 20:46.078
Don’t worry. No possums.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.538
-The garden’s just awesome.
-’Cause it’s healthy.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.208
Now my mum will have
a pretty garden all the time.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.961
Yes. All she needs to do
is water and feed it a lot.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.254
There’s more to do?

20:55.337 --> 20:58.715
Plants are like people.
They need to be watered and fed regularly.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.593
I get it. I need to be watered and fed
regularly too.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.388
That sounded better in my head.

21:04.471 --> 21:08.016
My mum doesn’t have time for that.
Remember what she said?

21:08.100 --> 21:12.271
Oh yeah. Okay. Well, now that we know
how to keep a garden healthy,

21:12.354 --> 21:15.565
we need to find a way
to help her take care of it that’s easy.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.942
Let’s brainstorm.

21:17.025 --> 21:23.991
What if we create a new type of plant
that never needs food, water, or sunshine?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.118
She wouldn’t have to do anything.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.413
But what if
we accidentally make zombie plants?

21:29.496 --> 21:33.875
I’d love that, but Iggy’s mum might not.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.837
Neither would Iggy’s mum’s son, me!

21:36.920 --> 21:40.424
Is there maybe a less zombie-ish idea?

21:40.507 --> 21:44.219
I’ve got one. We could ask garden gnomes
to take care of the plants.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.054
They eat a lot though.

21:46.138 --> 21:50.058
And my mum has enough cooking to do
for the café and me

21:50.142 --> 21:51.893
without also having to feed gnomes.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.354
She needs something really easy.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.731
Like a magic word?

21:55.814 --> 21:56.857
Or a button?

21:56.940 --> 22:01.903
Wait. Iggy’s mum said she wishes she could
press a button to take care of her garden.

22:01.987 --> 22:06.491
So maybe we could build something
that waters and fertilises the plants,

22:06.575 --> 22:08.660
with a button that controls it all.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.120
Okay, it’s ready.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.956
Iggy, that’s a plant-astic design.
I’ll build it.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.762
And done.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.348
Whoa! What is that thingamyjig?

22:29.431 --> 22:31.558
It’s called the Green Thumbinator.

22:31.641 --> 22:34.227
It waters and fertilises the plants
for you.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.314
And to turn it on,
you just have to press this button.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.988
Now that I have time for.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.783
Thanks to you three,
I finally have green fingers

22:47.866 --> 22:49.076
and a green garden.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.786
Fantastic!

22:51.870 --> 22:54.998
This is the best garden party
I’ve ever been to.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.752
And this is the best strawberry smoothie
I’ve ever had.

22:58.835 --> 23:02.214
Made with fresh strawberries
from my beautiful, healthy garden.

23:02.297 --> 23:06.885
And I’m working on a new dessert menu.
Maybe strawberry shortcake?

23:06.968 --> 23:08.136
<i>-</i>Yum!
-Yes!

23:08.220 --> 23:09.221
-Hey, kiddo.
<i>-</i>Dad!

23:09.304 --> 23:12.432
Just dropping off your sketchbook.
He’s always forgetting this thing.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.602
Don’t I know it. Come and have a smoothie
and enjoy the garden.

23:15.685 --> 23:19.606
Looks great. Maybe I need gardening tips
from you three.

23:19.689 --> 23:22.943
I’ve got the best tip.
You’ve just gotta make the plants laugh.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.904
What do you get
when Bigfoot walks through your garden?

23:26.738 --> 23:28.865
Stumped? Get it? Like “stomped”?

23:28.949 --> 23:29.991
Good guess.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.159
Squash!

23:31.243 --> 23:36.289
You know, ’cause Bigfoot’s big feet
would squash everything.

23:37.582 --> 23:38.834
-Nice!
-I get it.

23:42.587 --> 23:46.716
I have an idea.
Let’s meet another scientist. Come on.

23:51.972 --> 23:55.642
Hey, my name is Rory Aronson
and I’m a robotics engineer,

23:55.725 --> 23:59.729
and today I’m gonna show you how I take
care of my garden with my farming robot.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.236
This is the FarmBot.

24:06.319 --> 24:08.113
FarmBot plants seeds,

24:08.196 --> 24:10.532
waters, takes photos,

24:10.615 --> 24:11.950
and removes weeds,

24:12.033 --> 24:14.786
to take care of your garden
and grow plants

24:14.870 --> 24:17.747
so you can have fresh veggies
in your backyard.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.750
So one of our FarmBots is at NASA.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.086
They’re using it to do research
to figure out

24:23.170 --> 24:25.839
how are we gonna grow food in space?

24:25.922 --> 24:29.468
What they wanna do
is be able to send astronauts to Mars

24:29.551 --> 24:33.180
and then grow food for them
so that they can eat and survive

24:33.263 --> 24:36.016
without taking up
too much of the astronauts’ time.

24:36.099 --> 24:38.810
In here is the brain of the FarmBot.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.480
That’s a little computer
that tells the muscles,

24:41.563 --> 24:43.815
which are the motors, to move around

24:43.899 --> 24:47.360
and go to the right spot in the garden
and take care of everything.

24:47.444 --> 24:51.781
You use your phone to tell it where to go,
how much to water.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.117
Then you can set it on a schedule
and forget it.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.911
Once the tomatoes are ripe,

24:55.994 --> 24:58.997
FarmBot can send you a message and say,
“The tomatoes are ready.”

24:59.080 --> 25:00.707
“Time to make a salad.”

25:00.790 --> 25:02.834
Fun fact!

25:02.918 --> 25:07.088
Seeds are really picky about
the temperature they’ll start to grow in.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.091
In fact, spinach seeds
will only start growing

25:10.175 --> 25:14.137
if the soil
is between 60 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.726
Wasn’t that cool? Science is the best!
