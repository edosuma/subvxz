WEBVTT

00:12.960 --> 00:14.960
It was supposed to be

00:12.960 --> 00:14.960
a small thing, Lorna.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.800
It's turning into a V Festival.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.800
Why did you have to invite

00:15.000 --> 00:17.800
so many people?

00:17.840 --> 00:20.640
You agreed to a party, Ken.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.640
Parties require people.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.680
No, I agreed to a gathering.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.680
Have it on a Sunday.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.160
Cut off time, 5 pm.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.160
Leave the evening free

00:23.720 --> 00:27.160
to watch<i> Coast.</i>

00:27.200 --> 00:31.000
Don't be such a grinch.

00:27.200 --> 00:31.000
How often do you get to

00:27.200 --> 00:31.000
have a baby-naming day?

00:31.040 --> 00:35.480
Well, as it's a completely

00:31.040 --> 00:35.480
made up ceremony, I'd say

00:31.040 --> 00:35.480
what, whenever you want.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.560
All right, Dale?

00:35.520 --> 00:37.560
You've been gone hours.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.680
Yeah, I just got a lot

00:37.600 --> 00:40.680
on my mind.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.680
Worrying about Ling.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.400
If she'll ever be

00:40.720 --> 00:42.400
in touch again.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.440
I started running

00:42.440 --> 00:44.440
and before I knew it,

00:44.480 --> 00:46.440
I was in a place called

00:44.480 --> 00:46.440
Wolverhamptown.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.920
The jewel of the Midlands.

00:47.960 --> 00:53.160
Ah, poor Dale.

00:47.960 --> 00:53.160
Anyway, booze. Got.

00:47.960 --> 00:53.160
Snacks. Got.

00:53.200 --> 00:57.440
All we need now is

00:53.200 --> 00:57.440
to decide who's gonna conduct

00:53.200 --> 00:57.440
the baby naming ceremony.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.280
Oh. Chief Ken!

00:57.480 --> 00:59.280
Chief Ken! Chief Ken!

00:59.320 --> 01:01.000
Something you want to say, Dale?

01:01.040 --> 01:02.280
Please let me do this.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.840
He's the best darn baby uncle

01:02.320 --> 01:04.840
I have ever had,

01:04.880 --> 01:07.360
and I would cherish

01:04.880 --> 01:07.360
the chance to repay him.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.200
I don't know.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.920
A lot is expected of the guy

01:09.240 --> 01:12.920
who does Ye Olde Atheist

01:09.240 --> 01:12.920
Baby Naming Ceremony.

01:12.960 --> 01:17.400
Oh what! Zoe's coming

01:12.960 --> 01:17.400
to the party, and she's bringing

01:12.960 --> 01:17.400
her boyfriend from uni.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.720
Ooh. Bit awks.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.640
She's playing

01:18.760 --> 01:20.640
mind games, the bitch.

01:20.680 --> 01:24.240
-Well, if that's what she wants,

01:20.680 --> 01:24.240
then this player's gonna play.

01:20.680 --> 01:24.240
-Oh, God.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.440
Play, play, play.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.320
Course you can do it, Dale.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.080
Ha, ha yes! I don't know

01:28.360 --> 01:32.080
what it is, but I'm

01:28.360 --> 01:32.080
getting started right now.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.000
[car honking]

01:36.040 --> 01:37.880
I know that car horn.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
[honking continues]

01:41.840 --> 01:43.320
[theme music playing]

01:49.160 --> 01:53.800
Lorna, could you tell me why

01:49.160 --> 01:53.800
my Dad's 1976 Triumph Stag

01:49.160 --> 01:53.800
is on the driveway?

01:53.840 --> 01:58.480
Ken, I might've forgotten

01:53.840 --> 01:58.480
to mention. I sent an invite

01:53.840 --> 01:58.480
to your mum for Sunday.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.920
Interesting. Because I did

01:58.520 --> 02:01.920
expressly ask you not to.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.680
Ken, I didn't think

02:01.960 --> 02:03.680
she'd come.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.880
Cooey!

02:03.720 --> 02:06.880
Oh, Lorna.

02:08.080 --> 02:08.880
Belinda.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.040
-You look lovely.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.040
-You too.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.800
Kenneth.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.360
I see you drove Dad's car

02:17.840 --> 02:20.360
all the way from Spain?

02:20.400 --> 02:26.120
Not all the way. I had to have

02:20.400 --> 02:26.120
a tow through the Pyrenees

02:20.400 --> 02:26.120
after I blew the oil pump.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.280
-You did what?

02:26.160 --> 02:28.280
-Joking, Ken.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.160
Gosh, he's always been

02:28.320 --> 02:33.160
so easy to wind-up. And cars

02:28.320 --> 02:33.160
are made to be driven.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.680
Not this one.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.680
It's a classic.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.480
It belongs under

02:34.720 --> 02:36.480
a non-static tarp,

02:36.520 --> 02:38.680
only to be

02:36.520 --> 02:38.680
viewed by a select group of men

02:38.720 --> 02:40.760
who have equal reverence

02:38.720 --> 02:40.760
for its beauty.

02:40.800 --> 02:45.200
Yes, well, I asked Alan

02:40.800 --> 02:45.200
and he says he wants me

02:40.800 --> 02:45.200
to drive it.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.800
Oh well, as long as

02:45.240 --> 02:47.800
Dad's ghost thinks it's okay.

02:47.840 --> 02:51.360
Thanks for asking him

02:47.840 --> 02:51.360
by the way. Always makes things

02:47.840 --> 02:51.360
so much clearer.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.320
Right. Now where are my

02:51.400 --> 02:54.320
gorgeous grandchildren?

02:55.720 --> 02:56.520
[inaudible]

02:58.040 --> 03:03.960
-Cooey.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.960
-Nan! Oh hello, you,

02:58.040 --> 03:03.960
you look amazing.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.640
You too.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.640
Listen, I meant to

03:04.000 --> 03:06.640
send you a card

03:06.680 --> 03:09.520
when you got married

03:06.680 --> 03:09.520
to that American chap,

03:06.680 --> 03:09.520
but, you know.

03:09.560 --> 03:12.040
Also, I meant to

03:09.560 --> 03:12.040
send you a consolation card

03:12.080 --> 03:14.880
when he fell off that mountain,

03:12.080 --> 03:14.880
but it slipped my mind.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.840
Oh, shouldn't

03:14.920 --> 03:16.840
have said "slipped."

03:16.880 --> 03:19.040
The important thing is

03:16.880 --> 03:19.040
you're here now.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.400
Chief Ken, is this

03:19.080 --> 03:21.400
the family matriarch?

03:21.440 --> 03:27.160
Yes. Mum, this is Dale.

03:21.440 --> 03:27.160
He's our nanny. Dale,

03:21.440 --> 03:27.160
this is my mother, Belinda.

03:27.200 --> 03:33.520
Oh Belinda, behold your

03:27.200 --> 03:33.520
step-great-grandson.

03:33.560 --> 03:38.520
Oh. Lovely manners.

03:33.560 --> 03:38.520
Hello, Dale.

03:33.560 --> 03:38.520
And this must be...

03:38.560 --> 03:40.160
Oh yes. The big guy.

03:40.200 --> 03:45.440
Aw. What a lovely fat baby.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.960
Someone won't need

03:45.480 --> 03:47.960
a paternity test.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.880
If he's anything like Ken,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.880
it'll all fall off age two.

03:50.920 --> 03:55.440
And come flooding back

03:50.920 --> 03:55.440
age sixteen.

03:50.920 --> 03:55.440
What are you calling him?

03:55.480 --> 03:56.800
Sid.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.640
Oh no! Eurgh.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.640
Sid isn't a name.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.640
It's a noise.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.760
You should

04:00.680 --> 04:03.760
call him, Horatio.

04:03.800 --> 04:09.280
It's the perfect name for a

04:03.800 --> 04:09.280
fire sign. Lorna, speak to me.

04:03.800 --> 04:09.280
"Horatio"? Does it suit?

04:09.320 --> 04:11.680
-Well, actually...

04:09.320 --> 04:11.680
-We are calling him Sid.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.920
Well, I shall

04:11.720 --> 04:13.920
call him Horatio.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.880
You can insist on being

04:13.960 --> 04:18.880
perverse, but there's no reason

04:13.960 --> 04:18.880
for your mum to rise to it.

04:18.920 --> 04:24.760
Oh Horatio, Horatio.

04:18.920 --> 04:24.760
Horatio. Here we go.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.640
Nice strong brew

04:26.440 --> 04:28.640
for you, Belinda.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.560
Oh, thanks.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.280
Kenneth.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.280
[whispers] Go on...

04:37.000 --> 04:43.640
So, Mum, we should

04:37.000 --> 04:43.640
probably talk about the car

04:37.000 --> 04:43.640
whilst it's on my driveway.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.400
You do remember

04:43.680 --> 04:45.400
Dad left it to me?

04:45.440 --> 04:47.960
Your dad said

04:45.440 --> 04:47.960
a lot of things

04:45.440 --> 04:47.960
towards the end.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.120
Once he told me he regretted

04:48.000 --> 04:52.120
ever meeting me and that

04:48.000 --> 04:52.120
our marriage was a sham.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.280
Yeah, well, he did

04:52.160 --> 04:54.280
bequeath it to me.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.840
Ooh! Out comes

04:54.320 --> 04:56.840
the fancy language.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.640
Can I at least

04:56.880 --> 04:58.640
take it for a drive?

04:58.680 --> 05:00.440
Absolutely not.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.440
Your driving.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.360
You're far too emotional,

05:00.480 --> 05:03.360
you get yourself all worked up.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.920
You're behind the wheel,

05:03.400 --> 05:04.920
and--

05:04.960 --> 05:06.840
You know

05:04.960 --> 05:06.840
this happened

05:04.960 --> 05:06.840
once in 1985.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.600
your car's

05:06.880 --> 05:08.600
round a lamp post...

05:08.640 --> 05:11.960
-It was 1985.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.960
-Well, maybe not a lamppost,

05:08.640 --> 05:11.960
but you crashed it, and...

05:12.000 --> 05:14.960
-It was 1985!

05:12.000 --> 05:14.960
-You should've

05:12.000 --> 05:14.960
seen the state of the bonnet...

05:15.000 --> 05:16.240
It was 1985!

05:20.000 --> 05:25.280
"Bequeath. To hand down

05:20.000 --> 05:25.280
or pass on."

05:20.000 --> 05:25.280
It's a very common word.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.080
In the sixteenth century.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.080
We've had five wonderful years

05:27.120 --> 05:30.080
without her.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.240
Why couldn't she have

05:30.120 --> 05:33.240
stayed in Spain

05:30.120 --> 05:33.240
like an ordinary mother?

05:33.280 --> 05:37.960
Ken, she's nice. I mean,

05:33.280 --> 05:37.960
I know she has

05:33.280 --> 05:37.960
her funny ideas, but...

05:38.000 --> 05:42.680
You know she still calls

05:38.000 --> 05:42.680
those phone-lines every day to

05:38.000 --> 05:42.680
hear her horoscope. From Spain.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.880
Imagine growing up

05:42.720 --> 05:44.880
with a person like that.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.800
-Then there was--

05:44.920 --> 05:46.800
-The singing thing.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.880
Yes. That thing.

05:48.920 --> 05:54.040
Look, I don't mind mum

05:48.920 --> 05:54.040
being a mentalist if she's not

05:48.920 --> 05:54.040
being mental all the time.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.840
I mean, what was she thinking

05:54.080 --> 05:57.840
driving that car around?

05:57.880 --> 06:02.760
Were you one of those kids

05:57.880 --> 06:02.760
who kept their toys in boxes

05:57.880 --> 06:02.760
and never played with them?

06:02.800 --> 06:06.360
-It depreciates the value.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.360
-Give her a chance, love.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.800
-Are your eyes still open

06:14.480 --> 06:17.800
and your arms folded?

06:14.480 --> 06:17.800
-No.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.680
You know, you could

06:21.680 --> 06:24.680
at least let me help you

06:21.680 --> 06:24.680
set things up.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.600
Relax, Belinda.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.600
Everything's fine!

06:24.720 --> 06:28.600
Just great to have you here.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.800
-Ken is so pleased

06:28.640 --> 06:31.800
to have you here.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.800
-I don't believe that.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.560
I'm afraid Kenneth

06:31.840 --> 06:34.560
will always be

06:31.840 --> 06:34.560
angry with the world.

06:34.600 --> 06:38.120
There's nothing so sad

06:34.600 --> 06:38.120
as a frustrated artist.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.240
How is Dad

06:38.160 --> 06:40.240
a frustrated artist?

06:40.280 --> 06:43.800
Oh, in his youth,

06:40.280 --> 06:43.800
your father was

06:40.280 --> 06:43.800
a wonderful singer.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.520
The voice of a little angel.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.200
I used to take him round

06:45.560 --> 06:48.200
the local music festivals.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.240
Oh, the performances he gave.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.240
'Course he gave it all up

06:48.240 --> 06:52.240
to spite me.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.000
Please tell me

06:52.280 --> 06:54.000
there are videos.

06:54.040 --> 06:58.360
Ken's<i> "Morning has broken."</i>

06:54.040 --> 06:58.360
Oh, it would make

06:54.040 --> 06:58.360
your spirit soar.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
I would give anything

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
to hear it again.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.760
Dad. Oh, [singing voice] Dad...

07:04.800 --> 07:08.560
So, how come you made it

07:04.800 --> 07:08.560
this time? We haven't seen you

07:04.800 --> 07:08.560
for years, Belinda.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.840
Well, obviously,

07:08.600 --> 07:10.840
to meet Horatio.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.240
-Sid.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.240
-Whichever.

07:12.280 --> 07:16.080
The point stands.

07:12.280 --> 07:16.080
I came to see my family.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.720
Okay, you can see through me.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.720
But, you have to promise

07:16.120 --> 07:20.720
not to give me away.

07:20.760 --> 07:24.120
Absolutely. I'm ace

07:20.760 --> 07:24.120
at keeping secrets.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.680
Well, the real reason is...

07:24.160 --> 07:27.680
There's something

07:24.160 --> 07:27.680
I need to tell Kenneth.

07:27.720 --> 07:29.320
Oh?

07:29.360 --> 07:34.440
No, he should know first.

07:29.360 --> 07:34.440
I need to find

07:29.360 --> 07:34.440
the right time. And soon.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.440
Why? Is there a deadline?

07:36.480 --> 07:41.080
Well, I suppose there is

07:36.480 --> 07:41.080
the one big deadline. And I'm

07:36.480 --> 07:41.080
closer to mine than most.

07:41.120 --> 07:46.720
-I'm talking about death, Lorna.

07:41.120 --> 07:46.720
-Yes. Yes, I got that.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.440
You beauty.

07:57.160 --> 08:03.800
These tarot cards are powerful

07:57.160 --> 08:03.800
mystic tools which will reveal

07:57.160 --> 08:03.800
secrets known only to the gods.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.160
Spooky!

08:05.200 --> 08:08.440
Oh no.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.440
Not tarot now as well?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.960
Dale, pay no heed

08:08.480 --> 08:10.960
to that nonsense.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.280
Sh! Dad, we're just

08:11.000 --> 08:14.280
getting started.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.280
Go on, Nan. Turn a card over.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.520
Very well.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.520
I will turn the first card.

08:17.560 --> 08:21.360
-Which is...

08:17.560 --> 08:21.360
-[Ken on speaker]

08:17.560 --> 08:21.360
<i>Death! Ha, ha, ha!</i>

08:21.400 --> 08:24.760
-What?

08:21.400 --> 08:24.760
-Ken. It's not death.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.760
It's the two of cups.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.560
-Oh, so sorry. My mistake.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.560
-What does two of cups mean?

08:27.600 --> 08:31.960
-We shall know more when

08:27.600 --> 08:31.960
the next card comes. Which is...

08:27.600 --> 08:31.960
<i>-Death!</i>

08:32.000 --> 08:35.160
-Dad!

08:32.000 --> 08:35.160
-For God's sake. It's not death.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.160
It's another two.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.560
Snap.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.040
Kenneth, I know you've never

08:36.600 --> 08:39.040
believed in my Third Eye.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.280
Not in front

08:39.080 --> 08:41.280
of the children,

08:39.080 --> 08:41.280
please, mother.

08:41.320 --> 08:46.400
Stop it. Your skepticism

08:41.320 --> 08:46.400
is terribly hurtful.

08:41.320 --> 08:46.400
I have helped many people.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.680
-Yeah, Dad. Give over.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.680
-Oh sorry. Whooooo, spooky.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.120
-Go on, Nan.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.120
-So two of cups, two of wands.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.640
Dale, I see a girl.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.640
And she's pining for you.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.280
With a love

09:01.680 --> 09:05.280
that is pure and undying.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.720
She has loved you

09:06.560 --> 09:08.720
for many months,

09:08.760 --> 09:12.120
though there have been

09:08.760 --> 09:12.120
obstacles in her path.

09:12.160 --> 09:12.960
Yeah.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.520
And she will prevail.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.120
Yes. Where?

09:18.960 --> 09:21.120
Where is she?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.280
She is...

09:24.960 --> 09:28.040
-To the East.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.040
-Could be Shanghai.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.520
Doesn't sound very likely, Dale.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.520
I mean, what was that last card?

09:31.560 --> 09:35.000
A sun. Okay, yeah, no.

09:31.560 --> 09:35.000
I see how that's Easty.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.240
But I mean,

09:35.040 --> 09:37.240
could it mean

09:35.040 --> 09:37.240
somewhere hot?

09:37.280 --> 09:38.800
Well, it's an interpretation.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.800
Shanghai is hot.

09:40.840 --> 09:45.440
Or maybe could it mean

09:40.840 --> 09:45.440
she's fiery, or tans easily,

09:40.840 --> 09:45.440
or has a sunny personality.

09:45.480 --> 09:50.240
I mean, can we be certain

09:45.480 --> 09:50.240
what this means

09:45.480 --> 09:50.240
or if this girl even exists?

09:50.280 --> 09:52.200
Nothing is certain

09:50.280 --> 09:52.200
with the Tarot.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.360
Nothing.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.360
All meaningless. Cool.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.480
[sighs]

09:57.520 --> 10:00.440
Dale, ceremony's tomorrow.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.440
Shouldn't you be researching?

10:00.480 --> 10:03.800
-Yeah should probably do that.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.800
-Yeah, come on, then.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.320
Thanks, Nan, that was lovely.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.080
Hello, yes, can I speak

10:10.320 --> 10:14.080
to my consultant, please?

10:14.120 --> 10:16.360
Well, I suppose

10:14.120 --> 10:16.360
another one will do.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.160
Hello, yes?

10:20.400 --> 10:21.560
It's Cancer.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.280
No, go on, tell me

10:23.480 --> 10:26.280
what I need to know.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.320
Oh God, that soon?

10:31.360 --> 10:34.640
Yes, I was wondering

10:31.360 --> 10:34.640
about that moon in Aquarius...

10:36.520 --> 10:39.400
[chanting]

10:46.800 --> 10:49.800
Hey, mom.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.800
You're liking my props

10:46.800 --> 10:49.800
for tomorrow?

10:49.840 --> 10:53.320
This ceremony's gonna be

10:49.840 --> 10:53.320
so amazing, Uncle Sid's

10:49.840 --> 10:53.320
gonna poop himself.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.640
In all likelihood.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.720
Sorry, you were

10:55.680 --> 10:57.720
chanting and weaving...

10:57.760 --> 10:59.560
That's all right,

10:57.760 --> 10:59.560
come,

10:57.760 --> 10:59.560
check it out.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.680
This is a tribal blanket

10:59.600 --> 11:01.680
I had to weave.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.040
Pretty cool.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.040
Yeah, there are

11:01.720 --> 11:04.040
so many ceremonies

11:04.080 --> 11:07.200
that name babies

11:04.080 --> 11:07.200
around the world and

11:04.080 --> 11:07.200
they're all so beautiful,

11:07.240 --> 11:09.720
I figured, why not

11:07.240 --> 11:09.720
just combine

11:07.240 --> 11:09.720
them all into one.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.240
Oh, like a,

11:09.760 --> 11:11.240
like a mash up.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.920
Yeah exactly.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.920
Do you mind helping me

11:11.280 --> 11:13.920
run through it all?

11:13.960 --> 11:15.880
Yeah, sure, what do you

11:13.960 --> 11:15.880
want me to do?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.680
On the day

11:15.920 --> 11:17.680
it's gonna be

11:15.920 --> 11:17.680
me and Sid.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.400
So I figured I could be me

11:17.720 --> 11:20.400
and you could be Sid.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.080
-Okay.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.960
[imitating wailing baby]

11:24.000 --> 11:26.520
What? That's amazing.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.680
Only thing is he's probably

11:26.560 --> 11:30.680
gonna be on his back,

11:26.560 --> 11:30.680
waving his arms in the air.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.000
Let's imagine

11:30.720 --> 11:32.000
that bit.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.240
All right,

11:32.040 --> 11:33.240
let's do it.

11:40.040 --> 11:43.480
Ken, will you do

11:40.040 --> 11:43.480
something for me?

11:43.520 --> 11:45.280
Depends what it is.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.720
First you have to swear

11:45.320 --> 11:48.720
that you'll do it for me.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.720
Just a small thing.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.400
All right. I swear it.

11:51.440 --> 11:56.840
Take your mother on a drive

11:51.440 --> 11:56.840
tomorrow morning before

11:51.440 --> 11:56.840
the party. Make peace with her.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.960
Lorna. You traitor.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.960
That is not a small thing.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.480
Please. Have some alone time

12:00.000 --> 12:04.480
with her. Do it for me.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.360
You can take

12:05.600 --> 12:07.360
the Stagmobile.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.240
-Just called a Stag.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.240
-Ken, you won't

12:07.400 --> 12:11.240
have her forever.

12:24.920 --> 12:31.360
And then I take the water

12:24.920 --> 12:31.360
from the coconut

12:24.920 --> 12:31.360
and I sprinkle it on Sid.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
-Dale. Stop it.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
-What?

12:33.440 --> 12:34.760
Dale, give me that.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.080
[both giggling]

12:36.120 --> 12:38.160
-Okay, okay.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.160
-No, but this is serious.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.080
Remember, if you mess this up

12:38.200 --> 12:41.080
I will be without a name.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.480
-Right. Sorry. Serious.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.480
-Yeah.

12:46.520 --> 12:52.200
-Then I take the kohl,

12:46.520 --> 12:52.200
-Okay.

12:52.240 --> 12:57.600
and I line Sid's eyes.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.160
And then

12:59.120 --> 13:00.160
your cheeks.

13:02.520 --> 13:07.080
And then,

13:02.520 --> 13:07.080
I feed you honey.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.360
Oh just...

13:11.040 --> 13:13.200
[stammering]

13:15.320 --> 13:16.640
What next?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.920
I take this corn on the cob

13:18.240 --> 13:21.920
and I rub it all over you.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.400
You know what?

13:21.960 --> 13:24.400
I think you've

13:21.960 --> 13:24.400
got it from here.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.200
-Yeah? Okay.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.200
-Yeah.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.440
Okay. Thank you.

13:36.920 --> 13:40.840
Yes, very impressive, mother.

13:36.920 --> 13:40.840
You could perhaps slow down

13:36.920 --> 13:40.840
a little, eh?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.720
Your father

13:40.880 --> 13:42.720
didn't like driving fast.

13:42.760 --> 13:47.760
I always said,

13:42.760 --> 13:47.760
"Trust the universe, Alan, and

13:42.760 --> 13:47.760
it will send no pedestrians."

13:47.800 --> 13:49.200
And it rarely did.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.160
You know, Lorna thinks

13:51.120 --> 13:53.160
I'm mean to you.

13:53.200 --> 13:58.120
I soak it up.

13:53.200 --> 13:58.120
Your children never forgive you

13:53.200 --> 13:58.120
for falling short of perfection.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.840
[chuckles]

13:59.880 --> 14:03.640
Is that what you think?

13:59.880 --> 14:03.640
As a mother, you fall

13:59.880 --> 14:03.640
short of perfection?

14:03.680 --> 14:07.440
I had hoped this drive

14:03.680 --> 14:07.440
would be a chance to chat,

14:03.680 --> 14:07.440
have a nice time.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.440
What do I need to do?

14:09.480 --> 14:13.920
What will make this

14:09.480 --> 14:13.920
a pleasant time where we can

14:09.480 --> 14:13.920
talk like a mother and her son?

14:13.960 --> 14:15.840
There is something

14:13.960 --> 14:15.840
you can do actually.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.440
You little cracker.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.440
Like a choir of

14:20.600 --> 14:24.440
throaty young beauties.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.080
[motor revving]

14:26.120 --> 14:28.600
Well no time

14:26.120 --> 14:28.600
like the present, Ken.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.600
Time to drive it. Drive on.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.640
Yes, I'm going to.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.640
Thank you, mother.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.880
And second gear.

14:36.920 --> 14:42.360
And indicator, Kenneth.

14:36.920 --> 14:42.360
Where's your indicator?

14:36.920 --> 14:42.360
And third gear.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.760
Mother. I am a driver

14:42.400 --> 14:44.760
of thirty years standing.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.080
Don't throw one of

14:44.800 --> 14:49.080
your ridiculous tantrums again.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.080
And use your mirrors.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.960
Your father always said

14:49.120 --> 14:51.960
Kenneth is a stranger

14:49.120 --> 14:51.960
to mirrors,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.680
it's a wonder

14:52.000 --> 14:54.680
he even knows

14:52.000 --> 14:54.680
what he looks like.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.920
Eyes on the road.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.400
Can you

14:55.960 --> 14:58.400
please stop

14:55.960 --> 14:58.400
back-seat driving.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.880
Keep calm.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.880
You cannot afford to

14:58.440 --> 15:01.880
lose your temper like this.

15:01.920 --> 15:06.040
So predictable, when I saw

15:01.920 --> 15:06.040
your horoscope this morning

15:01.920 --> 15:06.040
I knew you'd be like this.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.920
I'm not going to let you

15:06.080 --> 15:09.920
rile me up. I am not going to

15:06.080 --> 15:09.920
let you get to me.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.080
[muffled]

15:12.120 --> 15:15.800
I'm going to rise above it,

15:12.120 --> 15:15.800
I'm going to rise above it.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.800
I am going to rise above it.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.320
What the fuck?

15:31.560 --> 15:33.320
Back off.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.960
Welcome to the multi-faith

15:33.360 --> 15:36.960
blessing ceremony

15:33.360 --> 15:36.960
for Uncle Sid Thompson.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.680
Please come in,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.680
take a flower lai.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.920
What's going on?

15:44.960 --> 15:48.400
Well, every religion in the

15:44.960 --> 15:48.400
world has its own way of

15:44.960 --> 15:48.400
welcoming a newborn child.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.920
I'm taking the most beautiful

15:48.440 --> 15:52.920
blessings from each

15:48.440 --> 15:52.920
and giving them to Sid

15:52.960 --> 15:54.560
so that every god loves him.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.960
Sounds a bit foreign.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.560
Zoe. I'm so glad

15:56.000 --> 15:58.560
you could make it.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.400
All right, Dylan?

15:58.600 --> 16:01.400
How's non-university life?

16:01.440 --> 16:04.880
Oh it's great. It's great

16:01.440 --> 16:04.880
being a real man,

16:01.440 --> 16:04.880
in the real world.

16:04.920 --> 16:09.000
Did you get my text?

16:04.920 --> 16:09.000
I brought my

16:04.920 --> 16:09.000
fit, new boyfriend along.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.960
Hope that's not

16:09.040 --> 16:10.960
too upsetting for you.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.720
Max, right? Put it there, fella.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.720
You are very welcome, my friend.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.760
Right so

16:16.840 --> 16:19.760
who do you guys know?

16:19.800 --> 16:24.440
Um? Ah! Laura's over there,

16:19.800 --> 16:24.440
she's looking hot.

16:19.800 --> 16:24.440
You know Laura?

16:24.480 --> 16:27.360
I think you used to be

16:24.480 --> 16:27.360
best friends with her,

16:24.480 --> 16:27.360
didn't you?

16:27.400 --> 16:31.520
Yeah, then you snogged

16:27.400 --> 16:31.520
her brother and she chucked you

16:27.400 --> 16:31.520
off the swimming team. Yeah.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.920
Oh, you so

16:34.880 --> 16:36.920
don't wanna do this.

16:36.960 --> 16:37.920
Do what, Zo?

16:39.360 --> 16:41.040
Something awkward for you?

16:42.880 --> 16:44.120
I'll see you around.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.920
Yep. Yep.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.920
See you around.

16:53.040 --> 16:57.200
Three packs of sausage rolls,

16:53.040 --> 16:57.200
I bought. You ate them

16:53.040 --> 16:57.200
before the guests even arrived.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.800
Lorna. I've had

16:57.240 --> 17:00.800
a near death experience.

16:57.240 --> 17:00.800
My mother tried to kill me.

17:00.840 --> 17:04.720
-To be fair, you were driving.

17:00.840 --> 17:04.720
-She knew what she was doing.

17:04.760 --> 17:09.280
Ken. You should make up

17:04.760 --> 17:09.280
with her. You'd miss her

17:04.760 --> 17:09.280
if she was gone.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.120
Yeah. Like I'd miss

17:09.320 --> 17:11.120
a flushed turd.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.120
-Oh, Ken.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.120
-Hey, Ken

17:13.160 --> 17:14.520
Oh, God.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.840
I noticed you ran out

17:14.560 --> 17:16.840
of sausage rolls. Not to worry.

17:16.880 --> 17:22.160
When I come to a party,

17:16.880 --> 17:22.160
I bring my own supply of bhajis.

17:22.200 --> 17:27.280
I have to say, Ken,

17:22.200 --> 17:27.280
I'm impressed. The talent.

17:22.200 --> 17:27.280
Who is that?

17:28.880 --> 17:31.640
That is my mother.

17:31.680 --> 17:37.280
The family resemblance

17:31.680 --> 17:37.280
is uncanny. And may I say,

17:31.680 --> 17:37.280
hubba hubba.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.200
No, you may not.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.240
-Hubba hubba hubba.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.240
-Stop this.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.000
Hubba bubba babba

17:42.280 --> 17:45.000
ba-ba ba-bam.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.760
[continues humming]

18:07.360 --> 18:12.760
Can't say much for the wine.

18:07.360 --> 18:12.760
My palette craves

18:07.360 --> 18:12.760
a more mature vintage.

18:14.120 --> 18:18.040
-Bhaji, Mrs. Thompson?

18:14.120 --> 18:18.040
-Are you a friend of Ken's?

18:18.080 --> 18:21.560
-I'm Ken's best friend.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.560
Steve Chance.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.560
-Oh.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.320
GP but former GP,

18:24.720 --> 18:28.320
soon to be

18:24.720 --> 18:28.320
a dotcom billionaire.

18:28.360 --> 18:32.880
-Can I ask you

18:28.360 --> 18:32.880
a very forward question?

18:28.360 --> 18:32.880
-Depends what it is.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.760
Was Ken a muscular child?

18:34.800 --> 18:38.840
Belinda, can I

18:34.800 --> 18:38.840
just have a quick word?

18:34.800 --> 18:38.840
Sorry Steve.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.920
You really need

18:41.760 --> 18:44.920
to tell your news

18:41.760 --> 18:44.920
to Ken, Belinda.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.160
It's not fair

18:44.960 --> 18:47.160
to keep him in the dark.

18:47.200 --> 18:52.320
He's obviously furious with me.

18:47.200 --> 18:52.320
I think that's why he sent over

18:47.200 --> 18:52.320
that strange Steve man.

18:52.360 --> 18:57.400
Maybe I won't say anything.

18:52.360 --> 18:57.400
No, maybe I'll just

18:52.360 --> 18:57.400
slip away quietly.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.360
You can't do that.

18:59.400 --> 19:04.000
I don't think I'll miss much.

18:59.400 --> 19:04.000
A slow winding down,

18:59.400 --> 19:04.000
some drawn out goodbyes.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.440
-Hey, Dylan.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.440
-Hey Zo. You cool?

19:16.480 --> 19:19.840
You're really gonna do this?

19:16.480 --> 19:19.840
Pull Laura just to get at me?

19:19.880 --> 19:25.240
Zoe, what a thing to say?

19:19.880 --> 19:25.240
You bet I am. And I'm

19:19.880 --> 19:25.240
gonna enjoy it too.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.720
You don't even

19:25.280 --> 19:26.720
fancy Laura.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.760
Nah. I don't even like her

19:26.760 --> 19:28.760
as a person.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.600
But here's the thing, Zo,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.600
that you've got to understand.

19:31.640 --> 19:35.320
You can't go playing

19:31.640 --> 19:35.320
mind games with the

19:31.640 --> 19:35.320
mind games-master, yeah?

19:35.360 --> 19:40.160
So what are we gonna

19:35.360 --> 19:40.160
call this, then?

19:35.360 --> 19:40.160
A check, a mate.

19:40.200 --> 19:46.320
Laura. Hi. We were just

19:40.200 --> 19:46.320
talking about someone

19:40.200 --> 19:46.320
other than you.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.080
-Dick.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.080
-Babe, I...

19:51.520 --> 19:56.280
You're good.

19:51.520 --> 19:56.280
God, you are good.

20:01.480 --> 20:08.200
Ken, will you please

20:01.480 --> 20:08.200
make peace with your mother?

20:01.480 --> 20:08.200
She's talking about leaving.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.120
Good. She can sod off

20:08.240 --> 20:11.120
back to Spain

20:08.240 --> 20:11.120
and choke on a chorizo.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.800
I wasn't meant to say this.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.800
But, she's dying, Ken.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.720
Dying?

20:18.920 --> 20:22.720
What do you mean?

20:22.760 --> 20:28.600
I mean she's dying,

20:22.760 --> 20:28.600
that must have been

20:22.760 --> 20:28.600
what she's come to tell you.

20:28.640 --> 20:32.520
But you're

20:28.640 --> 20:32.520
too pig-headed

20:28.640 --> 20:32.520
to let her in.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.600
But she looks so well.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.560
She's so very brave, Ken.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.400
Oh, mum.

20:42.440 --> 20:46.760
Dale. Can I ask you something?

20:46.800 --> 20:48.680
Sure, Chief Ken.

20:48.720 --> 20:52.520
Greetings everybody.

20:48.720 --> 20:52.520
Soon we will begin

20:48.720 --> 20:52.520
the baby-naming ceremony.

20:52.560 --> 20:55.680
But first, Chief Ken

20:52.560 --> 20:55.680
would like to say a few words.

21:00.600 --> 21:06.240
Thanks, I hadn't planned

21:00.600 --> 21:06.240
to do this, so bear with me.

21:06.280 --> 21:12.240
I just wanted to say

21:06.280 --> 21:12.240
that, sometimes you realize

21:06.280 --> 21:12.240
that our time is short,

21:12.280 --> 21:17.960
and the most important thing

21:12.280 --> 21:17.960
is to make those

21:12.280 --> 21:17.960
that we love happy.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.320
This is for you.

That's for you, mum.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.760
Bloody golden. Hey, mum,

22:54.880 --> 22:57.760
have you got the email

22:54.880 --> 22:57.760
for Dad's office?

22:57.800 --> 23:01.000
Terrible, Ken. I'm just

22:57.800 --> 23:01.000
a friend saying that.

23:01.040 --> 23:05.240
Well, if you knew anything

23:01.040 --> 23:05.240
about music, you'd know

23:01.040 --> 23:05.240
that's incredible. Bell-end.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.600
You were wonderful.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.480
Aw, you did that

23:09.640 --> 23:13.480
for me?

23:13.520 --> 23:19.240
Feel that wind?

23:13.520 --> 23:19.240
That's Alan. It feels

23:13.520 --> 23:19.240
like a proud wind.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.240
Ladies and gentleman.

23:30.760 --> 23:35.800
Every culture celebrates

23:30.760 --> 23:35.800
the arrival of a baby

23:30.760 --> 23:35.800
in a different way.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.560
The Chinese

23:37.960 --> 23:41.560
bless their children

23:37.960 --> 23:41.560
with red thread,

23:41.600 --> 23:48.600
and so I shall

23:41.600 --> 23:48.600
take this thread and tie it

23:41.600 --> 23:48.600
in Uncle Sid's hair.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.640
[all] Aw!

23:50.680 --> 23:53.640
I shut you out, mum.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.640
And that was wrong of me.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.560
Oh, Ken, what's got into you?

23:56.600 --> 24:01.800
In Japan the umbilical cord

23:56.600 --> 24:01.800
is packaged inside

23:56.600 --> 24:01.800
a small wooden box.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.200
I just want you to know

24:01.840 --> 24:05.200
that I will miss you

24:01.840 --> 24:05.200
when you're gone.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.960
Back to Spain?

24:07.000 --> 24:10.160
As we are lacking

24:07.000 --> 24:10.160
an umbilical cord, I will use

24:07.000 --> 24:10.160
a piece of spaghetti.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.600
-No, I mean, when you die.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.600
-Bit morbid, Kenneth.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.160
Come on, I know.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.560
Thank you.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.320
Lorna told me

24:18.600 --> 24:21.320
about your announcement.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.680
-I know you're dying.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.680
-No, I'm not dying.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.480
What?

24:26.520 --> 24:28.320
-Hindus perform the ceremony...

24:26.520 --> 24:28.320
-Lorna!

24:28.360 --> 24:29.760
[Ken whispering] Come here.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.600
Jatakarma to present the baby,

24:29.800 --> 24:33.600
honey at birth.

24:33.640 --> 24:38.280
-Mum's not dying

24:33.640 --> 24:38.280
-She is. Aren't you?

24:38.320 --> 24:41.640
-I think I would know.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.640
-Oh for fucks sake.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.680
Oh, bollocks.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.680
That last hour is a void.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.360
I only said that

24:43.720 --> 24:46.360
because I thought

24:43.720 --> 24:46.360
you were a goner.

24:46.400 --> 24:51.320
Ken, she had big news.

24:46.400 --> 24:51.320
I heard her talking

24:46.400 --> 24:51.320
to her consultant...

24:51.360 --> 24:54.400
-My horoscope consultant.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.400
-Oh my God.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.960
-Oh Yes, that does make sense.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.960
-Da'anzho!

24:57.000 --> 25:00.520
Well I'm sorry

24:57.000 --> 25:00.520
to disappoint you all

24:57.000 --> 25:00.520
by not being terminally ill.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.400
And now for

25:00.560 --> 25:02.400
a quick costume change.

25:02.440 --> 25:05.840
Oh, come on, Belinda,

25:02.440 --> 25:05.840
no one wants you

25:02.440 --> 25:05.840
to be terminally ill.

25:05.880 --> 25:06.880
Speak for yourself.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.360
Anyway, I do have

25:06.920 --> 25:09.360
big news.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.760
Guys! Dale's worked

25:09.400 --> 25:12.760
really hard at this.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.360
-Come on. Spit it out.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.360
-Well...

25:15.400 --> 25:17.800
Come on Belinda,

25:15.400 --> 25:17.800
whatever it is, just tell us.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.680
As part of the Jewish tradition

25:17.840 --> 25:20.680
I shall perform the Bris.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.480
The thing I came

25:20.720 --> 25:22.480
to tell you was...

25:22.520 --> 25:25.280
-Hey, dad.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.280
You might want to see this.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.280
-Not now, Dylan.

25:25.320 --> 25:30.240
-Alan was not your real father.

25:25.320 --> 25:30.240
-No, no, Dad, seriously.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.960
-I was already pregnant

25:30.280 --> 25:32.960
when I met Alan.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.960
-What?

25:37.200 --> 25:41.640
What just happened?

25:37.200 --> 25:41.640
Dale just circumcised Sid.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.520
-What?

25:41.680 --> 25:43.520
-Mazel Tov.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.600
Bloody hell.

25:54.480 --> 25:57.160
Do you think

25:54.480 --> 25:57.160
Uncle Sid will forgive me?

25:57.200 --> 25:58.280
Of course he will.

26:00.240 --> 26:05.080
I mean, some ladies

26:00.240 --> 26:05.080
prefer it, Dale,

26:00.240 --> 26:05.080
don't they Rach?

26:05.120 --> 26:09.480
Important thing is,

26:05.120 --> 26:09.480
did you enjoy

26:05.120 --> 26:09.480
your ceremony, Dale?

26:09.520 --> 26:12.160
Did it take

26:09.520 --> 26:12.160
your mind off things?

26:12.200 --> 26:18.960
It really did. I just,

26:12.200 --> 26:18.960
I've been so in my head

26:12.200 --> 26:18.960
about Ling and China

26:19.000 --> 26:21.680
and it's nice to remember

26:19.000 --> 26:21.680
who my real family are.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.280
Aw!

26:30.000 --> 26:31.360
Nothing...

26:31.400 --> 26:36.960
-Just going for a jog.

26:31.400 --> 26:36.960
You okay?

26:31.400 --> 26:36.960
-Yeah. Totally fine.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.080
Okay.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.960
Oh, yeah.
