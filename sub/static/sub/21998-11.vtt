00:00.898 --> 00:02.539
Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.931 --> 00:04.061
I almost drowned!

00:04.086 --> 00:05.352
You're so busy making sure

00:05.354 --> 00:07.955
- that Kate's not eating too much and...
- Kev, calm down.

00:07.957 --> 00:10.179
...and Randall's not too adopted.

00:12.161 --> 00:14.226
I just need somebody to help me.

00:14.314 --> 00:15.937
I just need help, please.

00:17.563 --> 00:20.146
- Uncle Kevin, slow down!
- What the hell are you...

00:20.171 --> 00:22.601
What? Get... Put your seat belt
on. What are you doing here?

00:33.765 --> 00:35.245
Oh!

00:35.484 --> 00:37.335
Looks like someone
landed on my railroad.

00:37.460 --> 00:40.334
- That'll be 50 bucks, sucker.
- Geez, Mom.

00:40.359 --> 00:43.702
Whoa, I can read the dice
from all the way over here.

00:43.727 --> 00:44.960
See? I told you, sweetheart,

00:45.029 --> 00:46.709
having glasses wouldn't be so bad.

00:46.734 --> 00:49.679
For now. But once school's back,

00:49.960 --> 00:51.633
the Urkel jokes will start.

00:51.702 --> 00:53.268
What? No, they won't.

00:53.468 --> 00:54.513
Yes, they will.

00:54.538 --> 00:55.789
It's just a fact, Mom.

00:56.093 --> 00:57.703
Do we have any more cookies?

00:58.257 --> 01:00.147
You know what, we both have had

01:00.172 --> 01:01.938
a couple of cookies already today,

01:02.007 --> 01:04.414
so maybe I could cut us
up an apple instead.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.851
- Hey!
- Dad, you're home!

01:06.876 --> 01:08.608
- Finally!
- I am, I am. Hey, hey. Hi, hi.

01:08.633 --> 01:09.959
- Hi!
- Hey, Dad.

01:09.984 --> 01:12.382
Finally. Big news, Pearsons.

01:12.718 --> 01:14.417
We're going on vacation.

01:14.486 --> 01:16.853
- We are?
- Yes, we are.

01:16.922 --> 01:19.856
New guy in Accounting
has a cabin in the Poconos.

01:19.925 --> 01:21.086
It's gonna be sitting there empty,

01:21.110 --> 01:22.950
so he said we could take it
for the whole week.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.289
That's, of course,

01:25.314 --> 01:27.757
if Mom thinks that's a good idea.

01:29.382 --> 01:32.553
I mean, a cabin does sound fun.

01:32.578 --> 01:34.378
- Yeah, it does sound fun!
- Super fun, right?

01:34.447 --> 01:36.247
- Yeah.
- Wait, what about Kevin?

01:36.429 --> 01:37.782
It's close to his football camp,

01:37.850 --> 01:39.350
so I'm gonna pick him up on Friday.

01:39.418 --> 01:41.185
I'll bring him up there. We're all set.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.608
I-I don't know why you guys
are still sitting down here,

01:43.633 --> 01:45.312
standing around. Go upstairs! Pack!

01:45.337 --> 01:47.103
We're gonna leave first thing
in the morning!

01:47.414 --> 01:48.703
Oh, God. I-I...

01:48.925 --> 01:51.609
I-I came in a little excited
in the entrance, right?

01:51.634 --> 01:53.243
- I didn't really give you a chance to...
- No.

01:53.267 --> 01:54.492
- Mm.
- No, you didn't.

01:54.517 --> 01:56.523
Yeah, but a log cabin, babe.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.789
I mean, this was...
this was too good to pass up.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.726
Okay. I'll, um...

02:03.468 --> 02:05.988
I'll start coming up with a list
of things that we need to pack.

02:06.031 --> 02:08.257
Um, top of the list, first thing:

02:08.469 --> 02:09.750
your bathing suit.

02:09.775 --> 02:11.992
We got to get you back
in that black bikini.

02:12.289 --> 02:13.661
No way.

02:13.729 --> 02:16.764
- The black bikini is retired.
- Wait. No, no.

02:16.832 --> 02:19.625
- Retired, Jack.
- Babe, she was too young to retire.

02:19.650 --> 02:22.710
All right? She's bored.
She-she wants a comeback.

02:24.804 --> 02:28.375
I cannot believe that I haven't
talked to Kevin in over a month.

02:28.444 --> 02:31.679
We've never, ever gone this long
without talking.

02:31.747 --> 02:33.647
Yeah, I know, babe.
Disconnecting is kind of one

02:33.716 --> 02:35.316
of the key rules of rehab.

02:35.384 --> 02:36.817
Kev's in rehab.

02:36.886 --> 02:38.990
I let Kevin get sent to rehab.

02:39.015 --> 02:41.810
Technically, the judge
at his DUI hearing

02:41.835 --> 02:43.557
let him get sent to rehab.

02:43.929 --> 02:46.100
But now is no time to be super literal,

02:46.125 --> 02:47.609
and I should know that. Sorry.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.601
Well, I hope
that it's been good for him.

02:49.626 --> 02:51.585
I mean, not just getting clean but...

02:51.610 --> 02:53.953
all of it. I still can't believe that

02:53.978 --> 02:55.526
I missed what was going
on with him, though.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.578
Hey. Hey, hey.

02:56.679 --> 02:58.535
We had a lot going on, too, you know.

02:58.838 --> 03:00.468
Yeah, we did.

03:03.109 --> 03:04.775
Okay.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.732
Right, so...

03:06.757 --> 03:09.053
portion-controlled hummus
and veggies for the plane ride.

03:09.078 --> 03:10.859
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna stay focused.

03:10.884 --> 03:14.273
'Cause when life takes us low,
Kate and Toby, we go high.

03:14.298 --> 03:17.063
That's right. Crushing it
in the face of tragedy.

03:17.088 --> 03:18.828
'Cause that's how Ka-Toby roll.

03:18.853 --> 03:20.562
Ooh, "Ka-Toby." I like it.

03:20.587 --> 03:22.461
Oh, hey, will you take out
the trash before we go?

03:22.485 --> 03:23.882
- Yeah.
- It smells like ass.

03:23.907 --> 03:25.398
"Ka-Toby." Are we going with that?

03:25.423 --> 03:27.289
'Cause I could get behind "Ka-Toby."

03:42.346 --> 03:43.781
Hey, uh, you ready?

03:45.304 --> 03:46.445
Toby?

03:46.937 --> 03:48.390
Uh, uh...

03:49.234 --> 03:50.531
Yeah, yeah!

03:51.073 --> 03:53.226
Yeah, come on,
let's get this show on the road.

03:55.992 --> 03:57.875
Hey, Sweet Pea.

03:58.327 --> 03:59.426
Hey.

03:59.617 --> 04:00.804
How you feeling?

04:01.039 --> 04:02.164
Fine.

04:02.218 --> 04:04.411
We just wanted to triple-check
that you're still feeling okay

04:04.435 --> 04:07.280
about staying with the sitter
while we go visit Uncle Kevin.

04:07.305 --> 04:09.271
Dad, I love Julie.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.107
She makes better brownies than you.

04:14.024 --> 04:16.827
- Randall.
- Yeah. Just... It's cool.

04:16.914 --> 04:20.716
- Look, baby...
- Mom, stop worrying about me.

04:21.007 --> 04:24.520
You've asked me if I'm okay 100
times a day for the last month.

04:24.750 --> 04:28.242
I told you, I was just sad
about Deja having to go home.

04:28.359 --> 04:30.179
I'm not gonna freak out
and run away again.

04:30.210 --> 04:32.171
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

04:33.031 --> 04:34.697
I understand why she had to move home.

04:34.766 --> 04:36.144
Well, you know, we just
want to make sure...

04:36.168 --> 04:36.787
- Beth.
- Mom.

04:36.812 --> 04:39.117
- All right. Yeah.
- Enjoy your book.

04:39.625 --> 04:40.703
Love you.

04:41.523 --> 04:44.304
Well, it seems
like she's doing really well.

04:45.031 --> 04:47.243
Why do you sound disappointed

04:47.311 --> 04:49.545
- when you say that?
- Because if she was doing

04:49.614 --> 04:52.428
a little worse, then...
I could stay here with her

04:52.453 --> 04:54.570
and not have to visit
your jackass brother.

04:54.688 --> 04:56.545
Maybe have some
of Julie's delicious brownies.

04:56.570 --> 04:58.056
Okay, first of all, Julie's brownies

04:58.124 --> 04:59.791
are bland as hell and lumpy.

05:00.108 --> 05:01.374
Yes, they are.

05:01.523 --> 05:04.085
Second of all,
regarding my jackass brother,

05:04.578 --> 05:05.830
cut him some slack.

05:06.265 --> 05:07.842
He didn't know Tess was in the car.

05:07.984 --> 05:10.546
Yeah. He just knew he was a danger
to everyone else on the road.

05:10.594 --> 05:11.914
What do you want me to say, babe?

05:11.992 --> 05:13.515
That he was irresponsible?

05:13.656 --> 05:15.306
That he made some terrible decisions?

05:15.476 --> 05:18.373
That I came within two inches of
separating his perfectly-coiffed head

05:18.398 --> 05:19.606
- from his body?
- That part.

05:19.631 --> 05:21.255
Well, I know how you feel, Beth Pearson.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.312
I feel it, too.

05:23.054 --> 05:24.578
But when I was at my lowest,

05:24.603 --> 05:26.125
Kevin was there for me.

05:26.572 --> 05:28.505
So now we got to be there for him, too.

05:28.648 --> 05:30.841
Fine. But I'm not making any efforts

05:30.909 --> 05:32.742
to hold in my passive-aggressive sighs.

05:32.811 --> 05:35.671
Since when do you ever make
any efforts to... Ho, ha-ha.

05:36.815 --> 05:38.289
Look, as for me,

05:39.203 --> 05:41.518
when I think about how
angry I am with him,

05:41.587 --> 05:45.242
I'm just gonna take a deep
breath and force myself to say,

05:45.843 --> 05:47.351
"We're here for you, Kevin."

05:47.734 --> 05:49.967
That is some white people-level
repression, babe.

05:49.992 --> 05:51.407
Well, I was raised
by white people, so...

05:51.431 --> 05:52.431
Everybody knows.

06:01.710 --> 06:02.953
Hey, Mom?

06:03.166 --> 06:04.298
Hmm?

06:04.562 --> 06:05.757
How you feeling?

06:07.085 --> 06:09.454
I'm okay. I'm just...

06:09.479 --> 06:12.813
I'm glad that we're all able to
be here to support your brother.

06:12.837 --> 06:14.655
Wow, this place looks great.

06:14.694 --> 06:16.039
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

06:16.064 --> 06:17.092
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

06:17.117 --> 06:18.272
- Hey-ya.
- Sweetheart.

06:18.317 --> 06:20.116
- How are you?
- Hi, Bug. I'm good.

06:20.185 --> 06:21.785
- How are you?
- So nice to see you.

06:25.531 --> 06:26.898
Come here, sis.

06:31.096 --> 06:33.176
Been wanting to slap that one
on you for a while now.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.592
Me, too.

06:34.617 --> 06:36.296
We've all had a rough month.

06:37.101 --> 06:38.154
Which reminds me.

06:38.179 --> 06:41.623
Hey, guys? I think we need
to prepare ourselves.

06:41.648 --> 06:43.357
Kevin's probably gonna look different.

06:43.382 --> 06:44.585
He might have lost weight.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.289
His eyes might have dark circles...

06:46.314 --> 06:47.945
- Hey-o!
- Kevin!

06:48.031 --> 06:49.750
Matt. Be good today, okay?

06:49.945 --> 06:52.148
- Oh, of course he's Mr. Rehab.
- Hi.

06:52.594 --> 06:54.632
- Come on.
- Oh.

06:54.657 --> 06:56.242
- Mm.
- I'm so glad you're okay.

06:56.267 --> 06:57.531
Kate, um...

06:58.631 --> 07:00.791
- I just wanted to tell you that I...
- No, no. I know.

07:00.899 --> 07:02.109
I know.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.390
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:13.304 --> 07:15.208
I just want you guys
to know, um, just...

07:15.277 --> 07:17.511
It means a lot to me that you all came.

07:17.579 --> 07:18.979
- It really does.
- Of course.

07:19.048 --> 07:21.848
And I'm... blessed

07:22.470 --> 07:24.585
to have you all here.

07:25.676 --> 07:27.244
We're here for you, Kev.

07:27.269 --> 07:29.421
- Thank you.
- How are you, sweetheart?

07:29.446 --> 07:31.298
Good. I'm good. You know,
I'm better than I've been

07:31.322 --> 07:33.609
in a long time. Barb! Hey!
Come on over here.

07:33.634 --> 07:36.000
- Hi.
- Uh, everyone, this is Barbara.

07:36.025 --> 07:38.039
- She's my therapist.
- Oh, hi!

07:38.064 --> 07:40.157
Yeah, she's-she's great.
You guys, you're gonna love her.

07:40.181 --> 07:42.609
She's got all the answers.
Uh, you're actually...

07:42.634 --> 07:45.257
You're my favorite Barbara that
I've ever met in my entire life.

07:45.282 --> 07:46.953
- Mm-hmm.
- And I've met Walters.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.414
And Streisand.

07:48.439 --> 07:49.835
It's very nice to meet all of you.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.235
- Nice to meet you as well.
- Nice to meet you.

07:51.259 --> 07:53.219
Barbara's gonna be, uh,
running our session today.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.473
Oh, actually, Kevin, I was
thinking that it might be better

07:56.498 --> 07:59.332
for our first session to meet
just your immediate family.

07:59.401 --> 08:02.350
So, just your siblings
and your mom and not the others.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.937
"The others."
What are we on, Lost?

08:05.937 --> 08:08.253
Barbara, I'm sorry, it's just...
the only thing is I asked them

08:08.277 --> 08:09.921
- to be here.
- Don't worry about it. It's okay.

08:09.945 --> 08:11.511
- Beth.
- No, what I mean is...

08:11.914 --> 08:13.880
it's about what's best
for Kevin's healing.

08:13.968 --> 08:15.750
Yeah, we don't want to
be the ones to impede

08:15.775 --> 08:17.072
- on Kevin's healing. That's...
- She's right.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.703
No, just do what you need to do.

08:18.728 --> 08:20.854
You know, go and not make
a big deal out of it.

08:20.923 --> 08:22.656
- That's great. Yes.
- You sure?

08:22.724 --> 08:24.035
- So, you know...
- It's-it's fine. It's okay.

08:24.059 --> 08:25.626
- I'll call you.
- Come back when you're done.

08:25.650 --> 08:26.741
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:26.766 --> 08:27.835
- Great.
- Absolutely.

08:27.860 --> 08:29.460
Hurry up, before they
change their minds.

08:43.234 --> 08:45.179
- Hi!
- Kevin, you're here!

08:47.008 --> 08:48.554
Did we move while I was at camp?

08:48.579 --> 08:50.351
No, I told you it was a vacation cabin.

08:50.376 --> 08:51.773
Didn't you read our letters?

08:51.945 --> 08:53.984
- You guys were on vacation without me.
- No.

08:54.009 --> 08:56.617
Just a few days, but we're gonna
stay here till next week.

08:56.642 --> 08:58.593
Kev, you are so big. I swear, you got

08:58.618 --> 09:00.259
twice as big while you were at camp.

09:00.284 --> 09:02.604
I want to hear everything about
football camp. Tell me now.

09:02.682 --> 09:03.948
It was really cool.

09:03.973 --> 09:05.289
- Yeah?
- I got two trophies.

09:05.314 --> 09:06.430
- You did?
- You want to see?

09:06.454 --> 09:09.023
Of course! Oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey, hey.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.981
So, Randall got glasses,
like, a week ago,

09:11.006 --> 09:13.093
and I need you not to tease him
about that, okay?

09:13.118 --> 09:15.258
Because if he doesn't wear them,
then he gets a headache...

09:15.282 --> 09:17.483
- Okay, I won't say anything.
- Thank you.

09:17.671 --> 09:19.218
Kev, you're finally here. This place

09:19.243 --> 09:20.607
- is so cool.
- Right?

09:20.632 --> 09:23.226
At night, Dad makes a
fire and we make s'mores

09:23.251 --> 09:25.171
and sometimes
we make popcorn there, too.

09:26.020 --> 09:27.250
Have you noticed

09:27.275 --> 09:28.921
that every thing Kate says she loves

09:28.946 --> 09:31.117
about this place
happens to involve food?

09:31.781 --> 09:33.773
Nah, she was talking about the fire pit.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.523
Yeah. In reference
to popcorn and s'mores.

09:36.548 --> 09:38.851
Come on. It's vacation, all right?

09:38.876 --> 09:41.140
And she has... baby weight.

09:41.191 --> 09:43.703
But she's not a baby anymore, Jack.

09:43.765 --> 09:46.726
I-I don't want
to make her self-conscious,

09:46.868 --> 09:48.901
but she's obsessed with food.

09:48.926 --> 09:51.812
And the doctor says that she's
heavier than most girls her age.

09:51.813 --> 09:53.978
Yeah, but that doctor,
he's basing it off of charts,

09:54.046 --> 09:55.813
not our actual kid,

09:55.882 --> 09:57.929
who takes after my grandmother,
who's just...

09:58.070 --> 09:59.828
- she was big-boned.
- Ugh!

09:59.867 --> 10:03.053
See, we've been doing
this same dance for years, Jack.

10:03.122 --> 10:05.677
I say that it's an issue, and
you say things like "big-boned"

10:05.702 --> 10:07.078
and "it's fine."

10:07.304 --> 10:08.648
I'm worried about her.

10:08.757 --> 10:09.914
- Okay.
- Yeah?

10:09.939 --> 10:15.693
Look... I will try to get her
to be more active, all right?

10:15.718 --> 10:18.406
Maybe find something physical
that she loves.

10:18.537 --> 10:20.921
- Yes? Thank you. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

10:22.321 --> 10:23.264
Hey.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.942
- Yeah?
- No more daily trips

10:25.011 --> 10:26.648
to that ice cream place either.

10:29.194 --> 10:30.437
- Jack.
- Yeah.

10:30.953 --> 10:32.007
Deal.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.962
- Hut, here we go.
- Hike, hike, hike. Go long, Dad.

10:33.986 --> 10:35.063
Go, go, go, go, Kate. Come on.

10:35.087 --> 10:36.343
Go long, Dad!

10:37.039 --> 10:38.515
Oh, oh, oh.

10:38.881 --> 10:40.070
Touchdown!

10:40.250 --> 10:42.099
Here, run it back to your brother.
Run it back.

10:42.144 --> 10:43.904
Run it back, run it back.
Go, go, go, go, go.

10:44.093 --> 10:45.593
Mom, check out my spiral!

10:45.618 --> 10:47.531
Yeah, I'm watching, bud. It's amazing.

10:47.556 --> 10:49.883
I'm gonna throw it so far
Dad can't catch it. Watch!

10:49.951 --> 10:51.203
- Okay.
- Kate, come on.

10:51.228 --> 10:53.617
- Go long with me.
- How come Randall doesn't have to play?

10:53.642 --> 10:55.594
- Don't worry about Randall. He's fine.
- I'm tired.

10:55.618 --> 10:57.273
How can you be tired?
We just got started.

10:57.298 --> 10:59.290
If I don't want to play
football, why do I have to?

10:59.314 --> 11:00.671
Dad! Dad, catch.

11:04.130 --> 11:07.999
You... you've been eating a lot
of sweets this week, okay?

11:08.289 --> 11:09.711
And I think that it's really important

11:09.735 --> 11:12.328
that you-you exercise
to-to stay healthy.

11:15.573 --> 11:18.040
I won't eat more sweets.
I just don't want to play.

11:18.085 --> 11:19.226
Kate.

11:23.124 --> 11:25.062
Just let her go, Dad.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.046
Hey, four-eyes, catch!

11:30.755 --> 11:31.953
Hey.

11:33.209 --> 11:34.640
Are you serious, Kevin?

11:34.665 --> 11:36.359
You almost hit your brother in the face.

11:36.384 --> 11:37.648
I know. I missed.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.609
No. Come here.

11:40.093 --> 11:42.703
Do you realize you almost hit
him in the head?

11:42.728 --> 11:44.429
What's gotten into you, bud?

11:44.454 --> 11:46.520
Do you really want to sit
in your room by yourself

11:46.545 --> 11:48.045
without your Game Boy,

11:48.070 --> 11:50.104
without any books, nobody to talk to?

11:50.129 --> 11:52.234
Why are you acting this way, huh?

11:52.695 --> 11:54.250
Thank you all for being here.

11:55.039 --> 11:57.023
It's an important part
of Kevin's process

11:57.048 --> 12:00.484
to speak openly to the people he loves.

12:00.917 --> 12:02.703
In a safe space.

12:04.810 --> 12:05.953
Kevin.

12:08.179 --> 12:09.593
- So right now?
- Yes.

12:13.390 --> 12:16.164
Uh, well, you know, first
of all, I just wanted to

12:17.328 --> 12:20.703
sincerely apologize to all of you.

12:21.109 --> 12:23.867
Um, obviously I hit a low point,

12:24.347 --> 12:25.578
and I, uh,

12:26.136 --> 12:27.703
ruined things with Sophie,

12:28.335 --> 12:29.875
and then I went ahead

12:29.900 --> 12:31.812
and ruined things with all of you.

12:33.604 --> 12:35.148
Uh, Kate, I...

12:40.539 --> 12:41.789
I'm sorry.

12:42.898 --> 12:44.929
I'm sorry that you had to go through one

12:44.954 --> 12:46.938
of the most difficult times
of your life without me.

12:46.962 --> 12:49.363
That... should never happen.

12:52.371 --> 12:54.992
You know, they-they tell us in
here that, um,

12:55.804 --> 12:57.391
they tell us that we have
to forgive ourselves

12:57.415 --> 12:58.976
for our wrongdoings, but...

13:02.140 --> 13:04.398
that one's gonna take some time for me.

13:06.914 --> 13:08.007
It's fine.

13:08.390 --> 13:10.843
And I'm sorry, too.

13:11.396 --> 13:13.117
For taking my eye off the ball.

13:14.722 --> 13:16.937
That's you. You're the ball.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.445
Randall.

13:25.740 --> 13:27.023
I'm sorry...

13:28.875 --> 13:31.010
that I scared you and Beth like that.

13:31.079 --> 13:32.912
I didn't know Tess was
in the car, obviously,

13:32.981 --> 13:34.468
but I am so sorry.

13:36.844 --> 13:38.328
We're here for you, Kev.

13:44.192 --> 13:45.453
And, Mom, I'm...

13:45.862 --> 13:48.289
I'm sorry that I put you through
all this.

13:50.182 --> 13:52.000
I just want you to be happy, Kevin.

14:01.649 --> 14:03.453
Whew. Right?

14:04.398 --> 14:05.625
That was helpful.

14:06.289 --> 14:08.015
Like, cathartic, you know?

14:09.164 --> 14:10.335
Was it?

14:12.323 --> 14:15.921
Because it felt a little polite to me.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.757
Do you want to talk to your family

14:18.782 --> 14:20.437
about what we've been exploring

14:20.574 --> 14:25.007
regarding where your addiction
might stem from?

14:35.810 --> 14:38.984
Kev... it's okay.

14:39.161 --> 14:40.820
It's good to talk about this.

14:43.687 --> 14:45.304
I have been telling Kev

14:45.627 --> 14:48.890
that he has to find out a way

14:48.915 --> 14:51.656
to talk about his grief.

14:52.477 --> 14:56.078
About our-our dad dying, so...

15:02.674 --> 15:04.601
Was that a look? Like, did...

15:04.685 --> 15:06.601
Yeah, they definitely got looks.

15:08.804 --> 15:10.960
We're gonna need to talk
about some things

15:10.985 --> 15:12.398
involving your family...

15:13.416 --> 15:15.682
and even about your father...

15:16.141 --> 15:18.054
that were not so perfect,

15:18.079 --> 15:20.156
when he was actually alive.

15:21.867 --> 15:23.382
Can we go there together?

15:24.784 --> 15:26.812
Oh, God, do we have to?

15:30.180 --> 15:32.181
- To "The Others."
- No, no.

15:32.585 --> 15:36.030
To the, uh... to the new Big Three.

15:36.055 --> 15:38.623
- Oh. To the new Big Three.
- Ah, new Big Three.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.445
- I like that. All right.
- Uh-huh.

15:42.471 --> 15:45.140
Mmm. I got to tell you,

15:45.734 --> 15:48.842
this is not how I pictured
my day at rehab going.

15:48.867 --> 15:52.602
Did you guys see Kevin do
that actor hand thing today

15:52.671 --> 15:54.204
- all of a sudden? Like...
- Hmm?

15:54.272 --> 15:55.953
Like, when you put
the two hands together.

15:55.978 --> 15:58.541
And-and say "thank you" and
then like, bow a little bit?

15:58.610 --> 16:00.671
Like an overgrown Mr. Miyagi.

16:00.696 --> 16:04.062
I mean, he drives
my nine-year-old around drunk.

16:04.087 --> 16:06.640
She has to watch her uncle
get handcuffed.

16:06.665 --> 16:09.679
But you know what? He bowed and
said thank you like Al Pacino

16:09.692 --> 16:11.292
so I'm just expected to forgive him.

16:11.361 --> 16:12.905
Well, I don't think anyone expects that.

16:12.929 --> 16:15.563
Randall does. Any time I try
to have a conversation

16:15.632 --> 16:17.601
about Kevin's behavior, I-I...

16:17.788 --> 16:21.123
- I go into the Pearson no-fly zone.
- Mmm.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.078
- The Pearson no-fly zone.
- Mm-hmm.

16:23.103 --> 16:25.740
I have flown hard
into the Pearson no-fly zone

16:25.809 --> 16:28.445
on many occasions,
and it does not end well.

16:28.859 --> 16:30.578
But what do you... what do you guys do

16:30.647 --> 16:33.784
when there's a no-fly zone
that you have to fly into?

16:33.809 --> 16:35.929
Like, right now, there's something
I got to talk to Kate about,

16:35.953 --> 16:37.611
that she's been hiding from me.

16:37.636 --> 16:39.085
It's not about Jack, right?

16:39.110 --> 16:40.227
- No.
- Because that's, like, a straight-up

16:40.251 --> 16:41.178
air strike zone.

16:41.203 --> 16:43.063
No, yeah. I learned that lesson
a long time ago.

16:43.087 --> 16:45.914
When we first started dating,
I saw a photo of the man,

16:45.939 --> 16:50.453
and I said his mustache made him
look like a '70s porn star.

16:50.478 --> 16:52.945
- Oh.
- Yeah, I thought she was gonna deck me.

16:53.593 --> 16:55.734
You know, Jack is untouchable.

16:55.759 --> 16:57.882
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, he is the saint we'll never meet.

16:57.907 --> 17:00.390
- Mm-hmm.
- Who none of us will ever live up to.

17:00.486 --> 17:01.632
Easy.

17:02.506 --> 17:04.406
You're entering my no-fly zone now.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.203
- To Jack.
- To Jack.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.061
He did kind of look like a porn star.

17:20.328 --> 17:21.710
Hey, Katie girl.

17:24.146 --> 17:25.468
Mind if I join you?

17:30.699 --> 17:33.859
What are we doing out here,
just... sitting?

17:35.696 --> 17:36.882
Okay.

17:37.610 --> 17:39.273
That-That's cool.

17:41.559 --> 17:43.585
Derek, down the street, called me fat.

17:47.664 --> 17:50.078
- Well, I think Derek...
- Do you think I'm fat?

17:53.336 --> 17:54.804
Katie girl, I think...

17:58.585 --> 18:03.655
I think that you are
my favorite-looking person

18:03.680 --> 18:05.164
on the whole planet.

18:14.977 --> 18:17.039
Oh, Mom, I can't find
my glasses anywhere.

18:17.064 --> 18:19.093
Well, where's the last place
you saw them, bud?

18:19.246 --> 18:21.281
I took 'em off
when I went to wash my face.

18:21.546 --> 18:24.951
I always put them on the desk
by the corkboard near the lamp.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.020
Why don't you go check
the bathroom one more time,

18:27.089 --> 18:28.579
and then I'll come help you
look for 'em, okay?

18:28.603 --> 18:29.718
Okay.

18:34.515 --> 18:37.078
Hey, Kevin, can you come here, please?

18:39.768 --> 18:40.820
What?

18:40.845 --> 18:43.367
Did you take your brother's glasses?

18:43.939 --> 18:45.609
No. Can I go?

18:45.634 --> 18:48.226
Kevin, it's not funny.

18:48.531 --> 18:49.537
It's not a joke.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.482
You know your brother needs
those glasses to see.

18:51.523 --> 18:52.961
So I'm gonna to give you
to the count of three

18:52.985 --> 18:54.214
to tell me where they are.

18:54.476 --> 18:55.625
- One...
- I hate you.

18:55.650 --> 18:59.156
Kevin, y-you don't hate me,
you're just overtired.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.812
This cabin sucks.

19:00.945 --> 19:02.671
- Kevin.
- This family sucks.

19:02.696 --> 19:04.328
- Enough.
- You suck.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.020
Go ahead, Kevin.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.529
I guess, my entire childhood,

19:27.554 --> 19:30.453
I always felt like
I came in second to you two.

19:31.094 --> 19:32.171
With Mom and Dad.

19:32.196 --> 19:33.554
You know, like I was a...

19:33.976 --> 19:35.734
like, fifth wheel of the family.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.351
Kevin, that's crazy.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.328
Kate, please. Let Kevin speak.

19:41.609 --> 19:43.371
Well, Kate, it's just, you had Dad.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.804
Right? You had Dad, and-and, Randall,

19:45.829 --> 19:47.890
you had Mom; you two were
like two peas in a pod.

19:47.915 --> 19:49.120
That's not true.

19:49.145 --> 19:50.843
I loved you all equally.

19:50.961 --> 19:54.328
Rebecca, Kevin is telling
you how he feels right now,

19:54.353 --> 19:56.554
And you will all have
a chance to let him know

19:56.579 --> 19:58.031
how you feel later on.

20:01.531 --> 20:04.296
Anyway, I-I think feeling
that way when I was a kid

20:04.960 --> 20:07.101
has developed this-this voice in my head

20:07.126 --> 20:10.648
that would just sort of repeat,
saying, "You're not enough."

20:11.382 --> 20:15.117
And-and I tried to drown
that voice out with things,

20:15.186 --> 20:19.988
like, uh, football or acting or fame.

20:21.414 --> 20:22.804
And, um...

20:24.742 --> 20:26.006
And I think it was only a matter of time

20:26.030 --> 20:28.046
before I turned to something worse.

20:28.996 --> 20:30.953
Why was it was only a matter of time?

20:38.414 --> 20:40.468
Because we're a family of addicts.

20:41.437 --> 20:42.617
Okay.

20:42.945 --> 20:44.424
We're not a family of addicts, Kev...

20:44.448 --> 20:46.448
Our father was an addict, Kate.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.374
His father was an addict.

20:48.399 --> 20:49.698
I'm an addict.

20:55.250 --> 20:59.294
And I-I know how hard you struggle

20:59.648 --> 21:01.435
with managing your weight.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.083
Believe me, I've seen it.
And I know how hard you try.

21:04.108 --> 21:07.743
But I feel like, maybe, Kate,
you're an addict, too, you know?

21:07.812 --> 21:10.234
And I feel like maybe you get
some of that from Dad.

21:14.109 --> 21:15.284
Why are you doing this?

21:15.353 --> 21:17.393
- I'm sorry, I'm not doing any...
- No, no, not you.

21:18.921 --> 21:21.424
Do you get more money
the sicker that he is?

21:21.492 --> 21:23.175
Or do you get to keep him here longer?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.532
- Oh, hold on. No, stop.
- How does that work?

21:24.556 --> 21:26.516
Kate, wait-wait a minute. Now,
you wanted me to talk about Dad,

21:26.540 --> 21:28.500
- right? Okay, so that's what I'm doing.
- Yeah...

21:28.900 --> 21:30.923
I'm talking about Dad,
but I can't sit here and pretend

21:30.947 --> 21:33.281
that the only reason I'm
messed up is because he died.

21:37.617 --> 21:39.482
We don't talk
about his drinking problem.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.192
Because he beat it, Kev.
It was just, like, a blip...

21:42.217 --> 21:43.750
That's crazy that you even say that.

21:43.775 --> 21:47.398
I'm crazy? You're here
by court order and I'm crazy?

21:48.718 --> 21:51.679
Rebecca, do you have an opinion

21:51.938 --> 21:53.929
about your husband's alcoholism?

21:54.078 --> 21:55.742
Did you ever talk to your children

21:55.767 --> 21:58.132
about their father being an addict?

21:58.157 --> 22:01.882
Did you ever warn them
that they would have the gene?

22:10.820 --> 22:14.658
Uh, my-my children lost
their father when they were 17.

22:14.820 --> 22:17.728
They didn't have their father
at their high school graduation.

22:17.797 --> 22:21.031
Randall didn't have his father
when his children were born.

22:21.100 --> 22:24.135
Kate will not have her father
at her wedding.

22:24.203 --> 22:27.638
So they had 17 years of memories,

22:27.781 --> 22:29.031
and that's it.

22:29.718 --> 22:32.209
There won't be any new ones
for the rest of their lives.

22:32.278 --> 22:35.079
So... no.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.625
No, I did not sit them down

22:37.710 --> 22:40.384
and color their memories of their father

22:40.453 --> 22:44.320
by talking about the one part
of him that wasn't perfect.

22:44.345 --> 22:47.701
And you really do a disservice
by calling my husband an addict,

22:47.726 --> 22:49.750
because he was so much more than that.

22:50.389 --> 22:51.507
Thank you.

22:58.101 --> 23:01.146
It's interesting
that you bring up examples

23:01.171 --> 23:03.707
of Kate and Randall

23:04.463 --> 23:05.671
but not Kevin.

23:07.117 --> 23:08.089
What?

23:08.114 --> 23:10.248
Kate not having
her father at her wedding

23:10.273 --> 23:12.140
and Randall not having

23:12.209 --> 23:13.942
his father when his children were born.

23:14.010 --> 23:16.778
Yes, because those were
just the first two examples

23:16.847 --> 23:18.079
that came to my mind.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.714
But don't you find it interesting

23:19.783 --> 23:22.968
that you have specific examples
for your other children

23:23.273 --> 23:25.218
- but not Kevin?
- I don't.

23:26.414 --> 23:28.483
I don't find it interesting...
I find it typical,

23:28.508 --> 23:30.452
to be honest with you. I mean,
this is what we talk about.

23:30.476 --> 23:31.843
- Mom, you never...
- Enough. Dude, enough.

23:31.867 --> 23:32.978
You don't have to lay into her.

23:33.002 --> 23:34.000
Okay, here we go.

23:34.025 --> 23:35.412
Yeah, "here we go" is right.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.703
Look, I...

23:37.148 --> 23:39.648
I've tried to empathize
with you, Kevin. I really have.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.906
Okay, I've held my tongue

23:42.515 --> 23:44.655
as your rich, spoiled ass got sent

23:44.724 --> 23:46.735
to this Four Seasons
for almost killing my daughter,

23:46.759 --> 23:48.504
when most anybody else
would've got sent to jail.

23:48.528 --> 23:51.789
I've held my tongue while you've
whined about your childhood,

23:52.070 --> 23:53.951
a childhood which
I was there for, by the way,

23:53.976 --> 23:55.656
which I bore witness to.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.469
Your football tosses
on the lawn with Dad,

23:58.538 --> 24:00.938
your tummy rubs from Mom
when you had a fever.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.531
See, Barbara may not have been there,

24:03.664 --> 24:06.162
but I was there, so don't you dare try

24:06.187 --> 24:08.873
to pull that same lame-ass
piece of wool over my eyes, bro.

24:08.898 --> 24:11.348
Okay? I've held my tongue,

24:11.828 --> 24:14.363
but I will not hold my tongue
while you go after our mother

24:14.388 --> 24:16.641
- for not parenting you...
- I'm not going after our mother,

24:16.665 --> 24:18.567
Randall. Why do you always
twist things around like that?

24:18.591 --> 24:20.186
- I'm not going after...
- He's not twisting anything, Kevin.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.478
- He's simply defending me.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.

24:22.511 --> 24:24.172
You're right. I'm sorry.
Why don't you take his side

24:24.196 --> 24:25.993
- because that's...
- I am not taking anybody's side.

24:26.017 --> 24:27.141
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- Hey, man, you want to talk

24:27.165 --> 24:29.297
about your tortured childhood,
you want to compare baggage?

24:29.321 --> 24:30.915
- No, Randall, Randall, listen...
- Yeah, let's do that.

24:30.939 --> 24:32.985
No, I would never compare my
tortured childhood with yours,

24:33.009 --> 24:35.047
Randall, because I wasn't
abandoned or adopted

24:35.072 --> 24:37.484
or I didn't have anxiety
or I'm not a genius

24:37.509 --> 24:39.288
- or any of those...
- No, you're definitely not that, Kevin.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.898
You know what else you're not?

24:41.344 --> 24:43.000
You're not an addict.

24:43.609 --> 24:44.718
Okay?

24:44.743 --> 24:46.992
The only thing that
you're addicted to is attention.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.262
I mean, what happened, Kev?
Your movie wrapped?

24:50.331 --> 24:53.232
You weren't rolling with Sly
and Ron Howard anymore?

24:53.257 --> 24:54.882
Nobody was looking at you?

24:55.039 --> 24:56.492
So you had to get us all up here,

24:56.570 --> 24:57.974
all eyes on you.

24:57.999 --> 24:59.265
Cue drug problem.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.296
- Okay.
- Okay, Kev.

25:09.296 --> 25:10.326
Okay, guys.

25:10.351 --> 25:12.054
No, you know what, I-I just... I'm...

25:12.562 --> 25:14.362
I want to know your thoughts
on this, Randall.

25:14.523 --> 25:18.179
Why do you think your daughter
was hiding in my car?

25:18.836 --> 25:21.570
Why do you think
your daughter was hiding in my car?

25:21.571 --> 25:22.657
You ever thought about that?

25:22.681 --> 25:24.594
- What about it?
- She's avoiding the Randall Show.

25:24.618 --> 25:26.040
- Don't you dare talk about my daughter.
- No, no. Welcome to the

25:26.064 --> 25:27.564
Randall Show, ladies and gentlemen.

25:27.589 --> 25:29.281
- Kevin. Kevin.
- Adopted by white people.

25:29.306 --> 25:31.453
Two dads. Does it get
any more interesting than that?

25:31.478 --> 25:32.877
Well, not for Randall.

25:33.296 --> 25:35.217
So, you-you move your
dying father into your home

25:35.286 --> 25:36.890
without thinking about what your wife

25:36.915 --> 25:38.954
or what your kids think of that,
and then you bring some-some

25:38.978 --> 25:41.453
strange girl into the house
after he dies, right?

25:41.500 --> 25:42.898
And the only person sitting there

25:42.923 --> 25:44.079
that no one's paying attention to

25:44.103 --> 25:45.993
- is your daughter, Tess.
- You know what, I'm done, man.

25:46.017 --> 25:48.597
- No, Randall, Randall...
- And cue Randall out the door,

25:48.666 --> 25:50.332
cue Mom chasing her favorite son.

25:50.401 --> 25:52.062
This is such a predictable
movie. You are so predictable.

25:52.086 --> 25:53.843
You raise your voice
to her one more time.

25:53.868 --> 25:54.938
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- All your children

25:54.962 --> 25:55.945
you love equally, right?

25:55.970 --> 25:57.881
Yes, I do love all my children the same.

25:57.906 --> 25:59.274
Yeah, I'm sure that you do. Wouldn't
it feel refreshing, though,

25:59.298 --> 26:00.485
just to right here in this forum, 'cause

26:00.509 --> 26:02.063
this is where you do that kind of stuff,

26:02.087 --> 26:03.857
to just tell everyone the truth, which

26:03.869 --> 26:05.558
is that you love Randall the most.

26:05.583 --> 26:07.194
- He's your favorite, right?
- Oh, that's not true, Kevin.

26:07.218 --> 26:08.727
- It's not true?
- That's absolutely ridiculous.

26:08.751 --> 26:09.891
- I'm not gonna say that, Kevin.
- It's ridiculous?

26:09.915 --> 26:11.041
Yeah, okay, it's ridiculous, then name

26:11.053 --> 26:12.102
me one thing that you and I have.

26:12.126 --> 26:13.615
One thing that you and I have that

26:13.627 --> 26:15.304
is special, that is just you and me.

26:15.329 --> 26:17.828
Not-not-not all of us. Not me
and Randall. Not me and Kate.

26:17.853 --> 26:19.093
Kevin, can you please stop?

26:19.118 --> 26:22.187
I-I-I'm-I'm flustered
and it's not kind of you,

26:22.212 --> 26:24.111
- what you're doing.
- Just admit that you love Randall more.

26:24.135 --> 26:25.523
We can stop pretending
to be this perfect family.

26:25.547 --> 26:26.953
No, he was just easier!

26:28.006 --> 26:29.242
He was easier

26:29.267 --> 26:30.821
and he didn't recoil when I touched him.

26:30.845 --> 26:33.203
And he wasn't some sullen teenager

26:33.228 --> 26:35.820
who was angry at me
for no reason and he didn't...

26:37.203 --> 26:41.694
abandon me and move away
after his father died.

27:01.547 --> 27:03.482
- Hey, Toby.
- Yeah, Beth.

27:03.986 --> 27:07.371
We're day-drinking on family day
from Kevin's rehab place.

27:07.396 --> 27:09.496
I know, it's like
an Alanis Morissette lyric.

27:11.383 --> 27:12.726
'Cause it's ironic.

27:13.052 --> 27:14.890
Okay. Big thought.

27:14.947 --> 27:18.282
Here it is: cheese fries.

27:18.307 --> 27:21.124
Ooh. I could get down and dirty
with some cheese fries.

27:21.193 --> 27:22.193
Toberman?

27:22.261 --> 27:23.515
- Mm. Uh-uh.
- Come on.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.290
Don't tell me you're not
about the cheese fries, man.

27:25.314 --> 27:27.234
Look.

27:31.312 --> 27:34.296
I found a bunch of junk food
at the bottom of our trash can.

27:34.515 --> 27:37.445
Kate has fallen off the wagon
and is hiding it from me.

27:40.593 --> 27:44.523
Well, who knows, maybe she'll
tell Kevin at therapy.

27:44.548 --> 27:47.718
Or maybe she'll tell Randall
or her mom, you know,

27:47.786 --> 27:50.351
one of, one of the
Pearsons on the inside.

27:53.875 --> 27:56.484
You know, when I was a kid,
I was obsessed with Star Wars.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.729
I loved that it was
this huge story, right,

27:58.754 --> 28:00.007
where a bunch of people come together

28:00.031 --> 28:01.781
to fight these giant wars.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.077
But when you break it down,

28:04.102 --> 28:07.093
it's really just about
a few people on the inside

28:07.625 --> 28:08.772
who know what's up.

28:09.953 --> 28:11.585
Luke and Vader.

28:11.610 --> 28:13.257
Leia and Obi-Wan.

28:14.781 --> 28:16.796
They were on the inside.

28:18.281 --> 28:21.148
And they're having
lightsaber battles on bridges,

28:21.173 --> 28:23.367
and they're talking about big stuff

28:25.000 --> 28:28.343
and everybody else
is pretty much Chewbacca.

28:30.257 --> 28:32.921
So in this story the three of us
are Chewbacca?

28:33.927 --> 28:35.703
If the Chewie fits, Beth.

28:42.653 --> 28:44.726
I married my best friend's wife.

28:53.226 --> 28:56.687
Nobody talks about it, but
everyone's always thinking it.

28:58.132 --> 29:01.289
I've been on the outside of this
family since I entered it.

29:02.667 --> 29:04.156
I'm not even Chewbacca.

29:05.023 --> 29:07.585
I'm one of the fighter pilots
who doesn't even have a name.

29:07.629 --> 29:08.843
That's not true, Miguel.

29:08.876 --> 29:10.039
It is.

29:11.931 --> 29:13.164
And I'm okay with that.

29:15.804 --> 29:19.609
You see, Toby, those four
lived through something

29:19.945 --> 29:23.062
very unique together.
They lived through the loss

29:23.820 --> 29:26.257
of the best man that any of us
will ever know.

29:27.273 --> 29:30.101
And that's why they get to be
on the inside, Toby.

29:31.639 --> 29:34.335
That's why they get the lightsabers.

29:41.134 --> 29:42.700
How drunk is Miguel?

29:48.233 --> 29:49.468
Whoa.

29:49.625 --> 29:50.640
Hi.

29:50.898 --> 29:51.943
Announcement.

29:52.742 --> 29:53.882
We did not

29:53.907 --> 29:56.117
Make it back before the rain started.

29:56.218 --> 29:57.250
I can see that.

29:57.686 --> 29:59.218
Go, go put some dry clothes on.

29:59.287 --> 30:00.460
Here, do you want a towel?

30:00.485 --> 30:01.750
- Uh, yes.
- Here.

30:01.775 --> 30:03.796
Thank you.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.609
You're not amused by my entrance.

30:10.046 --> 30:12.532
Yeah, I had a real day here with Kevin.

30:12.647 --> 30:14.304
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.148
I took Kate to the ice cream parlor.

30:22.117 --> 30:23.656
- What?
- I know.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.146
- Jack, we just talked about that.
- I-I know.

30:26.171 --> 30:27.251
I just, I just, I couldn't,

30:27.315 --> 30:29.085
I couldn't stand the way
she was looking at me.

30:29.109 --> 30:30.789
It was like I'd betrayed her.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.843
I would've given her
all the ice cream in the world

30:32.867 --> 30:34.491
to get her to stop
looking at me like that.

30:34.515 --> 30:36.437
You know, I get that look all the time.

30:37.656 --> 30:39.889
That's just what it means
to be the family bad guy.

30:39.914 --> 30:42.703
- No, you're not the bad guy.
- I'm the bad guy. I am. I'm...

30:42.945 --> 30:45.451
I'm the one that fights with Kate

30:45.476 --> 30:48.046
about whether or not to put
a Fruit Roll-Up in her lunch.

30:48.071 --> 30:50.359
I'm the one Kevin says that he hates.

30:51.507 --> 30:52.734
You're the good guy.

30:53.359 --> 30:58.303
You are. You're the guy that
announces family vacations.

30:58.328 --> 31:03.076
And you're the one who takes
them on those secret trips

31:03.101 --> 31:05.341
to Toys "R" Us when you're out
running errands with them.

31:05.671 --> 31:07.239
Ah, you know about those?

31:07.308 --> 31:10.500
- Oh, the bad guy knows everything.
- Right.

31:13.679 --> 31:17.898
I'll be more firm with Kate
about the food, okay?

31:17.945 --> 31:20.152
I will. I can be the bad guy.

31:20.177 --> 31:21.671
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

31:21.696 --> 31:23.812
No, you can't, but that's okay.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.820
Plus, I'll give our kids
something to talk about

31:27.845 --> 31:28.945
in therapy one day.

31:32.302 --> 31:34.992
You know, for a bad guy,

31:35.017 --> 31:38.139
you have one hell of a disguise.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.875
That is such a good guy thing to say.

31:42.157 --> 31:44.000
That is. Mmm.

32:10.683 --> 32:12.183
That was intense.

32:14.116 --> 32:15.320
Yeah.

32:18.468 --> 32:21.265
I'm very glad
Toby was not here for that.

32:22.812 --> 32:24.125
He probably would have cried, right?

32:24.149 --> 32:26.929
Oh, he would have cried the entire time.

32:30.804 --> 32:32.917
I really like that he cries, by the way.

32:33.632 --> 32:35.186
- Me, too.
- Mm.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.671
But it would have been too much.

32:38.114 --> 32:40.781
Way, way too much.

32:43.828 --> 32:45.226
You're not wrong, you know.

32:47.023 --> 32:48.273
I think...

32:49.320 --> 32:51.789
I think losing Dad
the way we did, when we did,

32:53.203 --> 32:56.365
it just, it's so much a part
of this, you know.

32:56.390 --> 32:57.608
Of all of us.

33:01.472 --> 33:02.672
May I?

33:16.359 --> 33:18.039
You know what would have been sweet?

33:18.593 --> 33:21.962
If we had someone documenting
our entire childhood,

33:21.987 --> 33:23.414
Boyhood style.

33:23.820 --> 33:26.710
- Mm, I hate that movie.
- Never saw it.

33:26.744 --> 33:27.843
I really loved it.

33:28.976 --> 33:31.023
I'm just saying, if we had someone

33:31.048 --> 33:33.582
filming our entire childhood,
objectively,

33:34.110 --> 33:36.046
then we'd never have to debate
about anything.

33:36.718 --> 33:39.280
Whenever we remembered things
differently, we'd just say,

33:39.348 --> 33:41.048
"Let's go to the videotape,"

33:41.117 --> 33:43.718
like Warner Wolf and then see
what was really up.

33:44.312 --> 33:45.519
Who's Warner Wolf?

33:45.588 --> 33:48.671
Sportscaster
guy, when we were growing up;

33:48.781 --> 33:52.289
used to always say:
"Let's go to the videotape."

33:52.495 --> 33:54.171
Then they'd play the highlights.

33:54.664 --> 33:57.257
- Warner Wolf.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

34:03.953 --> 34:06.710
I remember when they were
fitting me for glasses as a kid.

34:07.023 --> 34:09.728
I never actually realized
just how blurry

34:09.754 --> 34:11.353
everything had always been,

34:11.500 --> 34:15.437
until they stuck my face
in this weird thing they called

34:15.670 --> 34:16.701
"The Better Machine."

34:18.914 --> 34:20.531
Is this better?

34:21.132 --> 34:22.266
Or is this better?

34:23.476 --> 34:24.656
The... first one.

34:25.039 --> 34:27.375
Is this better? Or is this better?

34:28.264 --> 34:32.000
So many variations, so many lenses...

34:32.757 --> 34:34.967
each one sharper or blurrier.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.560
My view of the entire world
shifted like 12 times

34:38.585 --> 34:39.914
in less than a minute.

34:47.414 --> 34:50.734
I think everyone sees their
childhood with different lenses.

34:52.242 --> 34:53.654
You know, different perspectives.

34:55.094 --> 34:56.351
And I didn't come here today

34:56.376 --> 34:58.109
to crap all over your perspective, Kev.

34:59.117 --> 35:01.500
I came here today because last year,

35:01.525 --> 35:03.007
when I was at my lowest...

35:06.250 --> 35:09.359
Bro, I was crying on the floor
and I was shaking, and...

35:09.560 --> 35:10.892
hey, Kev, look at me.

35:11.039 --> 35:12.187
Please.

35:14.890 --> 35:16.359
You were there for me, man.

35:18.234 --> 35:20.609
And I wanted to be there
for you today and I wasn't.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.327
I did a bad job today and I'm sorry.

35:27.091 --> 35:28.703
I'm really sorry about Tess.

35:30.764 --> 35:31.930
I know.

35:43.945 --> 35:45.420
I love my crazy-ass brothers.

35:48.406 --> 35:49.639
I really do.

35:50.242 --> 35:51.484
So just to clarify:

35:51.509 --> 35:54.039
it's official that
I'm Mom's favorite, right?

35:54.512 --> 35:56.664
Is this guy for real?

35:57.296 --> 35:58.548
That's unbelievable.

35:59.101 --> 36:01.150
Yes, you are. I mean,
I think she clarified it.

36:01.219 --> 36:02.539
- Really? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

36:02.789 --> 36:04.101
Oh, I feel that... oh!

36:04.264 --> 36:05.563
It was Kev, it was Kev!

36:08.055 --> 36:11.502
Our Uber is going to be here
in four minutes.

36:12.476 --> 36:13.709
Still can't believe

36:13.734 --> 36:15.007
that you left the car at the bar.

36:15.031 --> 36:16.125
Yeah, well...

36:17.398 --> 36:19.515
Hey, can I ask you something
while I still have a...

36:19.844 --> 36:21.445
a brave beer buzz?

36:22.367 --> 36:24.132
Actually, can I just say
something first?

36:24.351 --> 36:25.500
Um...

36:26.689 --> 36:27.755
okay.

36:30.234 --> 36:31.843
Ever since the miscarriage,

36:33.328 --> 36:35.140
I have been...

36:36.616 --> 36:37.882
hiding junk food.

36:38.312 --> 36:39.429
Like, a lot.

36:39.945 --> 36:41.656
'Cause it makes me feel good.

36:42.695 --> 36:45.429
But hiding it from you
makes me feel awful.

36:46.429 --> 36:48.031
So, I wanted you to know.

36:50.007 --> 36:53.117
I have a lot of things
mixed up with food.

36:53.570 --> 36:56.000
And I thought that my issues
were kind of obvious.

36:56.809 --> 36:58.125
But I don't know.

36:59.464 --> 37:00.601
I-I don't know.

37:12.039 --> 37:13.195
Hey, bud.

37:13.828 --> 37:15.000
Brought you some dinner.

37:16.257 --> 37:18.445
I even made it
with the crunchy cheese on top,

37:18.564 --> 37:19.796
the way you like it.

37:26.586 --> 37:27.843
Hey, Kev.

37:29.718 --> 37:31.179
I'm really sorry.

37:31.429 --> 37:33.270
I want you to know that if you tell me

37:33.295 --> 37:34.762
you didn't take Randall's glasses,

37:35.432 --> 37:36.687
I believe you.

37:38.547 --> 37:39.648
Okay.

37:43.617 --> 37:44.929
All right. Well...

37:46.828 --> 37:48.728
we're just right inside
if you need anything.

38:13.046 --> 38:14.250
Kate?

38:16.166 --> 38:17.382
Randall?

38:36.641 --> 38:37.718
Hey, Mom...

39:14.953 --> 39:16.132
Mom?

39:17.171 --> 39:18.342
I'm sorry.

39:18.367 --> 39:20.115
I asked someone where your room was,

39:20.140 --> 39:21.859
and I just came to wait for you.

39:22.921 --> 39:27.210
'Cause I couldn't leave
without... talking to you.

39:29.882 --> 39:31.257
Feel like we've done enough talking

39:31.281 --> 39:32.850
for one day, though, right?

39:33.851 --> 39:35.250
I was, um...

39:37.379 --> 39:40.570
thinking about, uh,
your first day of kindergarten.

39:42.171 --> 39:46.326
And I remember walking you
three into the classroom,

39:46.351 --> 39:51.523
with Randall clinging to my leg
and your sister crying.

39:51.548 --> 39:53.195
But you just...

39:57.203 --> 39:58.985
You waltzed right in.

39:59.539 --> 40:00.671
And you didn't...

40:02.257 --> 40:03.664
you didn't even look back.

40:04.461 --> 40:05.757
And...

40:05.782 --> 40:07.187
your father and I were like,

40:07.212 --> 40:09.429
"Wow, look at our brave little boy."

40:10.718 --> 40:12.601
And I remember telling the other two,

40:12.626 --> 40:14.750
"Now you have to learn
to be just like Kevin."

40:15.922 --> 40:16.960
Yeah.

40:23.534 --> 40:25.523
I never worried about you.

40:27.555 --> 40:29.718
Because I didn't think that I had to.

40:32.380 --> 40:36.000
But now I realize that I was wrong.

40:49.385 --> 40:51.257
I didn't have an unhappy childhood.

41:06.866 --> 41:08.882
It wasn't as good as I thought.

41:14.320 --> 41:17.289
But I know we had moments,
you and me, Kevin.

41:17.314 --> 41:18.523
I know we did.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.765
I feel it in my bones.

41:37.407 --> 41:38.703
Yeah, maybe we did.

41:40.618 --> 41:41.726
I hope we did.
