WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:04.838
Oh, here it comes.
Here it comes.

00:04.938 --> 00:07.141
The comet, it's coming
right for us!

00:07.241 --> 00:08.576
No!

00:11.612 --> 00:13.981
That was the comet, not me.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.749
I'm gonna go find Pluto.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.551
Now that it's no longer
a planet,

00:17.651 --> 00:20.288
I bet it's all sad that
it's not relevant, like Kanye.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.991
Come on, Freddie,
you got to try it.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.327
You can actually go to space
without having to talk

00:26.427 --> 00:28.429
to Elon Musk.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.398
I'm too sad for space.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.300
Space is all I'm gonna have
this next week.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.867
He always gets like this

00:33.967 --> 00:35.736
when I stay with my mom
for a little while.

00:35.836 --> 00:39.307
Which I get. I'm the brightest
star in his universe.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.175
-Why's Gwen in town?
-[groans]

00:41.275 --> 00:43.344
I thought she was in Zanzibar
for the next two months

00:43.444 --> 00:44.978
marine biology-ing.

00:45.079 --> 00:48.849
Underwater with her fellow
sea monsters.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.951
Thanks for having
my back, Carly,

00:51.051 --> 00:52.086
but it's been a year.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.421
Gwen and I are
in a good place.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.788
I'm over the divorce.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.591
Really? It would take me
a lot longer to get over

00:57.691 --> 01:00.528
a gorgeous marine biologist
that travels the world

01:00.628 --> 01:04.365
and has eyes that just...
see you.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.867
And I'm less over it.

01:06.967 --> 01:10.304
Gwen's in town because
Millicent's drama club is

01:10.404 --> 01:12.773
doing Shakespeare scenes;
she's Juliet.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.042
-Oh, from what play?
-[knock on door]

01:15.143 --> 01:18.078
Hark! Is there a little
thespian in here

01:18.179 --> 01:19.447
who misses her mommy?

01:19.547 --> 01:21.182
[MILLICENT]:
Me!

01:21.282 --> 01:23.484
Oh, you said "thespian."

01:23.584 --> 01:25.486
Oh, I love you so much,

01:25.586 --> 01:28.055
but you smell
absolutely disgusting.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.291
It's probably just
the stench of regret

01:30.391 --> 01:32.059
over dumping Freddie.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.594
Hello, Gwendolyn.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.096
I see you're still trying
to make cargo pants happen.

01:36.197 --> 01:39.500
Look who's talking, crop-top.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.402
What you're smelling is

01:41.502 --> 01:44.538
a mÃ©lange of
sea turtle afterbirth,

01:44.638 --> 01:46.640
24 hours of middle-seat flights,

01:46.740 --> 01:49.510
and three layovers
just to get to you.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.780
Aka the stink of love.
[chuckles]

01:52.880 --> 01:54.782
Which I would have washed off,
but a pipe burst

01:54.882 --> 01:57.518
in my apartment, so we need
to find a place to...

01:57.618 --> 02:00.454
-Stay with me.
-Oh...

02:00.554 --> 02:01.755
Freddie, are you sure?

02:01.855 --> 02:05.526
Hmm? Oh, yeah,
you'd be there, too.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.628
Of course. Millicent already
has her own room,

02:07.728 --> 02:09.797
and we have an air mattress.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.532
That I will apparently be
sleeping on.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.967
Yeah, and you can
go take a shower.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.437
-I love this for us.
-[chuckles]

02:16.537 --> 02:19.106
But really, go shower now.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.574
I'll walk you out.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.811
You've been here
long enough anyway.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.985
[both squealing]

02:32.085 --> 02:33.554
It's so good to see you.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.523
When can we stop pretending
to hate each other?

02:35.623 --> 02:37.525
Never. I've been doing it
since the divorce.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.860
Honestly, I kind of
love it, though.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.231
It's like we're secret agents
that get blow-outs together.

02:43.331 --> 02:47.000
-Choo! Choo! Ha.
-[both squealing]

02:47.100 --> 02:48.336
* I know *

02:48.436 --> 02:49.803
* You see *

02:49.903 --> 02:52.340
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

02:52.440 --> 02:55.209
* And be so wonderful *

02:55.309 --> 02:59.179
* So wake up
the members of my nation *

02:59.280 --> 03:01.181
* It's your time to be *

03:01.282 --> 03:04.218
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

03:04.318 --> 03:07.120
* And the time to see
the brighter side *

03:07.221 --> 03:10.391
* Of every situation *

03:10.491 --> 03:12.125
* Some things are meant to be *

03:12.226 --> 03:15.763
* So give your best
and leave the rest to me. *

03:18.232 --> 03:19.767
Harper, I didn't know
you liked pool.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.236
I don't.
Disgusting little game.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.605
I only learned so I could
ruin Spencer's life.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.474
[phone chimes]

03:26.574 --> 03:28.809
Oh, no!

03:28.909 --> 03:32.145
What are you doing? I'm trying
to take a shot here!

03:32.246 --> 03:35.082
I mean, what's the matter,
young child?

03:35.182 --> 03:38.519
The person who was supposed
to design the costumes

03:38.619 --> 03:41.355
for my Shakespeare performance
dropped out.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.823
That's terrible.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.025
Costumes are the most important
part of any show.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.261
Of course you know that.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.862
Clothes are your thing.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.065
I mean, look at you right now.
Girl has taste.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.767
If only you could
design the costumes.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.469
Ooh.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.004
Oh, come on, Harper.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.972
Volunteer is the right thing
to do.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.141
I believe the children are
our future.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.110
Calm down, Whitney.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.545
I'll do it.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.848
Mm-hmm. Pull those strings,
my little puppet master.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.651
You know what's really horrible?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.020
Our set designer also
dropped out.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.756
What?! The set is the most
important part of any show.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.625
Of course you know that.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.493
Set design requires
a true artist.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.630
Like you.
And look at this place.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.465
Boy has taste.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.867
I hear the trap,

04:26.967 --> 04:29.036
but I'm too flattered
not to fall in it.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.504
I'll do it. Ugh!

04:30.604 --> 04:32.272
Great. I'm gonna go upstairs
and call Mrs. Decker,

04:32.373 --> 04:33.541
my drama teacher.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.709
Oh, and by the way,

04:35.809 --> 04:38.211
the volunteer who does
the most impressive work

04:38.312 --> 04:40.113
always gets a prize.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.582
[BOTH]:
Prize?

04:41.682 --> 04:45.285
Wow, this place brings back
so many memories.

04:45.386 --> 04:48.656
And so many rules.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.190
Yep. No laughter
after 9:00 p.m.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.426
Ah. Is it weird to say
that I miss

04:52.526 --> 04:54.328
her anti-tick shampoo?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.332
Aw...

04:58.432 --> 05:00.568
It's the locket with
Millicent's baby pics

05:00.668 --> 05:02.870
before she grew
into her giant head.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.708
"Gwen and Freddie"?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.543
Why is she wearing this?

05:09.643 --> 05:12.913
And why am I talking to myself?

05:13.013 --> 05:13.814
Hmm.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.684
Lots of questions.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.588
This is
a disgusting little game.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.323
Mm-hmm, thank you.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.326
Huge news! My costumes are about
to be even more incredible,

05:26.427 --> 05:27.728
because the museum of velvet

05:27.828 --> 05:29.730
is understandably
going out of business

05:29.830 --> 05:32.165
and donating everything to me.
[laughs]

05:32.265 --> 05:36.970
Huger news: uh, my brain is
donating an amazing idea to me.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.374
The set should be full marble
and sandstone. Booyah!

05:40.974 --> 05:42.410
Should someone check
on Carly and Gwen

05:42.510 --> 05:44.277
to make sure
they haven't killed each other?

05:44.378 --> 05:46.780
What am I saying?
Gwen would destroy her.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.149
You letting her stay
at your place?

05:49.249 --> 05:50.851
Very evolved.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.820
I didn't expect that from you.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.287
We're co-parenting,

05:54.388 --> 05:56.657
so we've learned to be good
around each other.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.493
But seeing her again
does make me miss...

05:59.593 --> 06:01.529
Aw, it's too embarrassing.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.797
Ooh. Dish.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.799
Actually, it is a dish.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.036
She used to make
these unbelievable enchiladas.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.771
-Mmm.
-It was her specialty.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.606
-Gwenchiladas.
-Oh...

06:12.706 --> 06:14.475
-They're that good?
-Yes.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.376
That is why I miss Gwen.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.278
[sighs]:
It's hard to admit,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.213
but sometimes
I lie awake at night

06:20.313 --> 06:22.683
imagining what it would be like
to have that again.

06:22.783 --> 06:26.754
Honestly, just talking about it
makes me crave it even more.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.056
I know it's bad
for my heart, but...

06:29.156 --> 06:30.691
I still want it.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.426
[chuckles]
Sounds pretty cheesy.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.194
[SPENCER]: Why don't you
just say how you feel

06:34.294 --> 06:35.963
and ask her
to recreate the magic?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.031
[FREDDIE]:
I've hinted at it, but she says

06:38.131 --> 06:40.834
it's really complicated, and I
don't want to pressure her.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.239
[door opens]

06:47.475 --> 06:48.609
Hey. Where's my mom?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.778
Wasting Freddie's water,
taking a shower.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.815
I mean, the landlord pays
for the water, but still,

06:54.915 --> 06:56.116
the Earth suffers.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.351
Drop the act.
I know you're friends.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.753
Hey.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.455
When you guys chat,
does she ever mention

07:01.555 --> 07:05.626
any divorced person she's
romantically interested in?

07:05.726 --> 07:08.095
You mean Freddie?
Why do you ask?

07:08.195 --> 07:09.730
Because I just
overheard him talking

07:09.830 --> 07:11.499
about how much he misses my mom.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.233
So weird, right?

07:13.333 --> 07:15.335
Yeah. Very weird.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.606
You know something.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.973
Nuh-uh.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.842
My baby locket.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.044
Don't open it.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.412
Whoa.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.147
Do you think they want
to get back together?

07:27.247 --> 07:29.149
Aw, who cares?
I'm getting them back together

07:29.249 --> 07:30.784
whether they want to or not.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.153
We shouldn't interfere.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.890
Unless we should.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.392
No, we don't want
to manipulate them.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.062
Unless we do.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.365
-You make good points.
-Yep.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.606
So, you're hooking up
two people

07:52.706 --> 07:54.742
who already gave it a shot
and got divorced?

07:54.842 --> 07:57.244
You're like
the worst dating app ever.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.546
Worse than the one you tried

07:58.646 --> 08:00.848
for people
who look like celebrities?

08:00.948 --> 08:02.015
Doppelbanger?

08:02.115 --> 08:03.183
Michael B. Jordan.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.752
More like Michael B. Ugly.

08:04.852 --> 08:08.756
But making Ethiopian food
to recreate their first date?

08:08.856 --> 08:11.458
Why are you working so hard
on this parent trap?

08:11.559 --> 08:14.562
It's not a parent trap.
It's a parent suggestion.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.496
-Mm.
-Gwen's back at her apartment

08:16.597 --> 08:18.866
dealing with the whole
burst pipe situation.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.168
She thinks after that she's
gonna have a relaxing evening

08:21.268 --> 08:22.435
with her daughter.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.104
But I guess the joke's
on her, huh?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.907
Exactly. 'Cause Millicent's
gonna come to our place

08:27.007 --> 08:28.208
for a sleepover.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.911
I just know how devastated
Freddie was When Gwen left.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.913
If there's a chance
she wants him back,

08:33.013 --> 08:35.583
the least I could do is put them
alone in a room together.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.886
Alone? Aren't you forgetting
about someone?

08:39.687 --> 08:42.422
[shudders]:
No. I remembered.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.893
Who's ready for a slumber party?

08:45.993 --> 08:49.096
And look, I had a puzzle made
of Freddie doing a puzzle.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.731
[chuckles]
Nifty, huh?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.733
I told myself
I have to finish tonight,

08:52.833 --> 08:56.169
or something horrible
would happen to him.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.840
Okay, I'm sleeping at
Michael B. Ugly's house tonight.

09:03.611 --> 09:07.380
Wow, Mrs. B.,
that was a really fun game

09:07.480 --> 09:09.482
of Befriend, Marry, Scold.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.018
[laughs]:
Thank you.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.387
You know, girls,
this may surprise you, but...

09:14.487 --> 09:18.058
I have never been asked
to a sleepover.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.328
What?!

09:21.428 --> 09:24.231
Millicent, can you believe that?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.498
I cannot.

09:25.599 --> 09:29.637
It seems impossible that
that is possible.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.772
Puzzle time!
I separated the pieces

09:31.872 --> 09:37.244
into several piles:
freckles, dimples and skin tags.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.914
I don't see any pieces
with facial stubble.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.984
I know.
I had them photoshopped smooth.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.554
Ah! Puzzle piece cut!

09:47.655 --> 09:49.923
Not to worry--
I have miles of gauze.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.025
BRB.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.964
Good thing I brought
my mini first aid kit.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.104
Ugh! This better be worth it.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.806
I was gonna read a book tonight.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.140
Magazine.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.475
On your phone.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.844
Probably the audio version.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.113
It's still words.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.548
Trust me, we got this.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.453
Oh, my God. Do you have a date?

10:20.553 --> 10:22.455
Is she here right now?

10:22.555 --> 10:24.792
Yup. Apparently, she's you.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.426
What?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.228
Oh.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.596
"Dear parental units,

10:29.697 --> 10:31.598
"wanted to give you
some alone time

10:31.699 --> 10:33.600
"to reminisce
about the good old days.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.602
"Enjoy dinner
in each other's company.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.205
-Love, your little miracle."
-Mm.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.673
"Alone time"?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.274
Why would she even...

10:41.374 --> 10:42.776
Ethiopian food.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.712
She's recreating our first date.

10:44.812 --> 10:48.248
Not exactly. You don't have
that stupid soul patch.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.383
And you got rid
of that terrible eyebrow ring.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.386
Not by choice. I was on a dive,
and a barracuda bit it off.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.823
-Nah, yeah, it was super cute.
-Mm-hmm.

10:55.923 --> 10:56.824
[chuckles]

10:56.924 --> 10:59.159
So, she's trying to set us up.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.393
This is awkward.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.395
[sighs]
Actually, it's perfect.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.734
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.239
[exhales]

11:12.339 --> 11:14.307
[voice squeaks]:
Okay, shoot.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.776
I'll say this,

11:15.876 --> 11:18.611
your dad has lovely pores.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.148
Why are we doing this puzzle
when we could be spying

11:21.248 --> 11:22.582
on my parents?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.284
I know. It's killing me.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.319
Dare we take a sneak peek?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.455
Oh, we dare.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.091
Oh, good, you're already here.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.260
I need to measure
the circumference of your head.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.095
It's a very normal size.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.564
-Hmm, that's not what
this tape measurer says. -Hey.

11:37.664 --> 11:40.100
I'm making hats
for everyone in the play.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.802
Or you can go ahead
and tell them to give me

11:41.902 --> 11:43.971
the prize now, that's cool.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.472
Thanks, okay.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.074
-Come on.
-Aah!

11:47.174 --> 11:49.009
-What...?
-Life-changing announcement!

11:49.109 --> 11:50.577
That prize is mine.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.880
The sandstone I was gonna use
is too heavy,

11:52.980 --> 11:55.816
so I'm switching
to a lighter medium.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.785
Toast.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.153
It looks like stones,
but it's light and easy to move.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.822
Ring, ring, ring! Uh, hello?

12:01.922 --> 12:04.457
Creativity Monthly? Why, yes,
I will be on your cover!

12:04.557 --> 12:06.760
Click!

12:06.860 --> 12:09.729
"Toast"? You can't build
a set out of toast.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.432
Not the time to ask for details
from the weirdos.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.035
Is what I would say
on opposite day.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.469
Toast is great.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.205
Go toast! Bye.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.472
Hey, where are you two going?

12:19.572 --> 12:20.707
It's time to "puzz" it up,

12:20.808 --> 12:22.409
and I'm down a finger!

12:22.509 --> 12:24.711
Spencer will help you.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.646
-(mouths)
-He's the best at puzzles.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.148
Isn't that right, Harper?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.818
He's the best at nothing.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.622
Yeah, I already got
one of Freddie's weird eyes.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.724
I found his cowlick!
I found his cowlick!

12:37.825 --> 12:39.827
After Millicent's father
passed away,

12:39.927 --> 12:43.163
I never thought I'd meet someone
who loved her as much as me.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.866
Mmm, "as much as I do."

12:47.234 --> 12:48.535
I see why you divorced me.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.670
Well... now it's time

12:50.770 --> 12:52.639
for me to divorce somebody else.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.674
Wait, that came out weird.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.044
Uh... I'm seeing someone.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.512
No!

13:00.280 --> 13:01.348
I'm just kidding.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.483
[both laugh]

13:03.583 --> 13:06.486
Honestly, I'm-I'm happy for you.

13:06.586 --> 13:07.821
Thanks.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.792
[whispers] It's working.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.895
We both knew this was
bound to happen.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.064
We knew, too, we knew, too.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.232
-The only part I'm worried
about is Millicent. -Mm.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.201
Maybe this is
just too much for her.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.104
I wish I had a way to know
how she's gonna react.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.006
Well, should we go talk
to her right now?

13:26.974 --> 13:30.310
No, I need to gauge her moods
over the next week.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.846
Maybe even over the next year.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.083
Aw, you're such a planner.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.551
This is why
I fell in love with you.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.354
Methinks I can speed
this process along.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.024
I must away.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.699
* *

13:54.634 --> 13:55.869
Hey, guys.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.605
Harper, I thought
you'd be wearing a costume.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.541
I know you love
a Ren fair wench moment.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.945
Hmm. Mrs. Decker said it would
"steal focus from the children."

14:05.045 --> 14:07.214
Because my costumes are
too good.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.982
Really? She didn't say anything
about my sets.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.484
-Aw.
-'Cause she was speechless!

14:11.584 --> 14:14.054
Okay, I'm gonna go find
our little star.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.555
-Who?
-Who?

14:15.655 --> 14:17.090
Millicent.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.959
The entire reason
we're all here.

14:19.059 --> 14:22.429
-Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, that's why I'm here.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.233
[laughs]

14:26.333 --> 14:28.201
Oh, program, Mrs. Benson?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.470
Inside is a QR code
you can scan with your phone

14:30.570 --> 14:33.073
to vote for which aspect
of the show you like the best--

14:33.173 --> 14:35.342
the sets or the costumes!

14:35.442 --> 14:37.077
But why wait till after the show
to fill it out?

14:37.177 --> 14:38.311
Just turn down
your phone's brightness

14:38.411 --> 14:39.846
and do it
during the boring parts.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.682
My flip phone doesn't have
brightness or a camera.

14:42.782 --> 14:46.153
Now hand me my program,
I like to plan my pee breaks.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.758
Mr. Spencer, we have
a problem with the set.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.327
Apparently it's...
[whispers]: falling apart.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.930
-[exclaims] -I'm not surprised
your sets are crummy.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.432
'Cause they're toast. [laughs]

14:59.532 --> 15:02.002
Oh, are you playing
a court jester?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.370
'Cause this is serious!

15:04.737 --> 15:06.073
Don't worry. I'll fix it.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.840
I'm gonna need
some peanut butter, stat!

15:07.941 --> 15:09.409
To stick the toast together?

15:09.509 --> 15:11.678
I was just hungry,
but that's a great idea!

15:11.778 --> 15:13.580
Move it!

15:15.115 --> 15:16.984
Ah, there you are.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.619
I can't believe you're gonna do
a grand romantic gesture

15:19.719 --> 15:21.054
after your scene.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.355
Do you want to run through
what you're gonna say?

15:22.455 --> 15:24.324
Oh, sure,
I'll say something like,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.559
"Thank you
for that thunderous applause.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.096
A standing O?
That's unexpected."

15:29.196 --> 15:30.797
Okay, rein it in, Meryl.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.632
Get to the part
about your parents.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.101
Oh, right.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.437
"This scene was dedicated
to two star-crossed lovers.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.506
"My loving parents
Freddie and Gwen.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.176
"You've managed to do what
Romeo and Juliet never could.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.646
I'm so happy you two are getting
back together."

15:48.481 --> 15:49.849
Wow.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.784
That is really effective.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.654
You know what,
bring it in, little sis.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.689
Don't push it.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.430
-So I was thinking.
-Hmm?

16:03.530 --> 16:06.033
Sea turtles never worry about
telling their kids anything.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.668
They just bury their eggs in
the sand and run away forever.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.338
You think that could work
in this situation?

16:11.438 --> 16:13.940
-Probably.
-Okay.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.076
Hey, Freddie. Gwen.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.844
What are you guys talking about?

16:17.944 --> 16:20.780
We're trying to figure out how
to have a talk with Millicent.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.382
Oh, really?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.584
What's the topic
of conversation?

16:24.684 --> 16:26.619
Well, it's
kind of personal, but...

16:26.719 --> 16:28.988
I already know what it is.
Are you proud of me?

16:29.089 --> 16:30.557
I'm proud of me.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.659
Wait, you know about Ernie?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.594
Wait, what?

16:34.694 --> 16:35.995
Who's Ernie?

16:36.096 --> 16:37.730
He's Gwen's new boyfriend.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.666
And don't worry about it,
Carly, I'm fine.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.301
She told me
about him over dinner.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.270
You have a boyfriend
and you didn't tell me?

16:43.370 --> 16:44.471
But we're friends.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.406
Whoa! Wait, hold up.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.175
You guys are friends?

16:48.275 --> 16:49.342
Since when?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.478
Since always.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.147
I just didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.015
Why would I be hurt?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.517
Remember a few months ago

16:57.617 --> 16:59.352
when I told you I was visiting
my dad in Italy?

16:59.452 --> 17:00.987
-Yeah.
-Zanzibar.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.522
(gasps)

17:02.622 --> 17:04.391
Did she let you swim
with the turtles?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.626
Ate right out of my hand.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.261
Oh!

17:08.361 --> 17:10.797
Yeah, okay... this hurts.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.400
Wait, if you're dating
some guy named Ernie,

17:13.500 --> 17:15.568
then why was Freddie's picture
in your locket?

17:15.668 --> 17:18.171
It's a present for Millicent
to help break the news.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.006
I put pictures
of Freddie and me in it,

17:20.107 --> 17:22.742
so she'd always have both of us
close to her heart.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.745
Oh, my God, Millicent!
I-I got to go.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.514
Excuse me. Sorry!

17:27.614 --> 17:30.383
-Excuse me.
-[music playing]

17:32.152 --> 17:35.188
Hear ye, hear ye and welcome.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.490
Our first scene is
in fair Verona.

17:48.701 --> 17:51.171
If your child has
a peanut allergy,

17:51.271 --> 17:52.739
please avoid this area

17:52.839 --> 17:56.576
or there will be much ado
about anaphylactic shock.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.879
And now Romeo and Juliet.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.014
[applause]

18:04.151 --> 18:05.752
O Romeo!

18:05.852 --> 18:08.721
Romeo!
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

18:08.821 --> 18:12.859
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.799
What's in a name?

18:19.899 --> 18:22.635
That which we call a rose
by any other name

18:22.735 --> 18:24.771
would smell as sweet...

18:24.871 --> 18:26.038
Psst!

18:26.139 --> 18:28.341
Don't do it!

18:28.441 --> 18:30.810
At the end!

18:32.379 --> 18:34.447
Romeo, doff thy name,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.849
and for that name
which is no part of thee,

18:36.949 --> 18:39.286
take all myself.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.094
Oh, no. This can't be good.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.596
Shh!

18:49.696 --> 18:51.864
My granddaughter is acting.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.402
Hear ye, hear ye!

18:55.502 --> 18:58.271
I cometh from the future.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.939
That is

19:00.039 --> 19:04.110
why forth I hath
this strange outfit.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.279
Uh-huh. Thou art not

19:06.379 --> 19:08.515
the man I was expecting.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.918
I bring news, my fairest Juliet.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.387
You know that plan-eth

19:14.487 --> 19:17.957
thou haveth
when thy scene is doneth?

19:18.057 --> 19:19.959
Don't do it... eth.

19:20.059 --> 19:23.162
[MILLICENT]: Just tell me
what news thou hast for me,

19:23.263 --> 19:25.565
annoying traveler!

19:25.665 --> 19:29.035
Your mom and Freddie aren't
getting back together.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.438
-Wha...?
-What?

19:32.972 --> 19:34.374
Ooh!

19:35.542 --> 19:37.810
Uh, five-second rule.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.314
Oh, okay, we're going

19:41.414 --> 19:43.950
to take a short intermission.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.253
[whispers]: Close the curtains,
close the curtains.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.455
[scattered applause]

19:56.062 --> 19:58.765
I can't believe nobody voted
in our QR poll.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.099
Yeah.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.568
'Cause the QR code you made
is just a link

20:01.668 --> 20:03.169
to the IHOP menu!

20:03.270 --> 20:04.971
I want that prize!

20:05.071 --> 20:07.640
I'm not supposed to say
anything, but Millicent told me

20:07.740 --> 20:10.677
it's a companion falcon
for my main man Jericho.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.245
What?! She told me it was

20:12.345 --> 20:14.514
the Alexander McQueen
armadillo boots Lady Gaga wore

20:14.614 --> 20:17.149
in her groundbreaking
music video "Bad Romance."

20:17.250 --> 20:19.252
Just spitballing here,
but you don't think Millicent

20:19.352 --> 20:21.521
just made up the prize,
knowing how competitive we get,

20:21.621 --> 20:22.922
so that we'd drop everything
and do stuff

20:23.022 --> 20:24.891
for her children's drama club,
do you?

20:24.991 --> 20:26.326
-No.
-Nah.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.861
-Actually, that totally
checks out. -Yeah.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.229
Mr. Spencer,

20:30.330 --> 20:32.198
Ms. Harper, the principal
would like to see you.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.667
-Oh, no, we're in trouble.
-You're in trouble.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.669
-I bet you I'm gonna get
those boots! -No, no, no.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.875
I love it. Thank you.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.446
You sure you're not upset that
we're not getting back together?

20:46.546 --> 20:48.615
A little. I mean...

20:48.715 --> 20:50.249
who wouldn't want
their family back together?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.985
See, that's the thing--
we may not live together,

20:53.085 --> 20:55.622
but we're still a family
and we're always gonna be.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.392
I do like having
two Christmases and birthdays.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.660
Wait.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.462
If both of you marry
other people,

21:02.562 --> 21:04.130
then get divorced again,
would that mean

21:04.230 --> 21:06.666
that I get four Christmases
and birthdays?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.167
(Freddie and Gwen laugh)

21:08.267 --> 21:10.803
Is there a reality show
that can speed this up?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.540
Looks like all
of Millicent's scheming

21:13.640 --> 21:16.142
that I had very little to do
with was worth it.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.245
Carly, there you are.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.847
I had so much fun
at our sleepover

21:20.947 --> 21:22.715
that I don't think
I can sleep tonight,

21:22.815 --> 21:25.217
not without another long hang.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.354
Just us chicas.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.288
I'll be by later
with my first aid kit

21:29.389 --> 21:31.458
and some homemade dental floss.

21:31.558 --> 21:33.460
See you then.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.967
-* We're winners *
-* Winners *

21:41.067 --> 21:43.269
-[SPENCER]: * Winners. *
-What's with the blue ribbons?

21:43.370 --> 21:44.671
Oh, it's a participation ribbon.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.038
Everybody gets one.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.740
Including me.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.376
That's it? That's the prize?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.578
It's a public school.
There's no budget for prizes.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.112
I'm shocked
there was even a play.

21:53.212 --> 21:55.515
These ribbons weren't
the only prize, Fredd-o.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.550
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm not sure how it happened,

21:57.650 --> 21:59.085
but Harper and I
have been appointed

21:59.185 --> 22:00.453
co-chairs of the PTA.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.355
Yeah!

22:02.455 --> 22:04.056
The Parent Teacher Association?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.224
-Yeah!
-Yep!

22:05.324 --> 22:06.793
For parents and teachers.

22:06.893 --> 22:07.827
-[grunts]
-Right?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.762
Of which you are neither.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.198
-You got it! [laughs]
-[grunts]

22:12.298 --> 22:13.766
Amazing!

22:13.866 --> 22:16.002
The school was desperate.
No one else volunteered.

22:16.969 --> 22:20.139
Ms. Carly? The principal would
like to see you next.

22:20.239 --> 22:22.341
Oh, of course, Olive.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.411
Did I get
a cool blue ribbon, too?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.413
No. You ruined the play.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.581
You're in big trouble,
young lady.

22:28.681 --> 22:33.520
[all oohing]
