00:12.523 --> 00:15.958
<i>And so,
we move into round number nine,</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:18.927
<i>and the referee brings them together
here at the start of the round</i>

00:18.929 --> 00:22.164
<i>telling them that it's got
to be cleaner than it is.</i>

00:22.166 --> 00:24.732
<i>And Romano points towards
Nord as if to say,</i>

00:24.734 --> 00:27.201
<i>"He's the man employing
the dirty tactics here".</i>

00:27.203 --> 00:29.904
<i>The dark eyes say they know...
an exchange of jabs,</i>

00:29.906 --> 00:34.808
<i>right at the start of this the...
ninth round of a scheduled 12.</i>

00:34.810 --> 00:37.111
<i>Romano is on the front foot
trying to force Nord</i>

00:37.113 --> 00:39.881
<i>back to the ropes
directly above us here.</i>

00:40.682 --> 00:45.118
<i>Potentially just 12 minutes now for
Nord to turn this contest back his way.</i>

00:45.120 --> 00:49.923
<i>He leans in, the long rangy left jab,
and two more, and a third one now,</i>

00:49.925 --> 00:52.827
<i>trying to find the range
for that follow-up right hand.</i>

00:53.694 --> 00:56.262
<i>It has to be said that
only once or twice has he landed</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:59.098
<i>with real venom here,
but he has been getting through.</i>

00:59.100 --> 01:03.801
<i>Another right hand from Joe Romano,
and still Nord doesn't see it coming.</i>

01:03.803 --> 01:08.340
<i>And still it stalls him. And still
it forces him onto the back foot.</i>

01:08.342 --> 01:11.175
Now he set this count, he went
to the center of the ring.

01:11.177 --> 01:16.214
<i>Right hand from Romano gets through. And for
the umpteenth time, can he get on the ropes?</i>

01:16.216 --> 01:20.318
<i>And a left hand this time from Joe
Romano, but Nord takes the hit.</i>

01:20.320 --> 01:22.819
<i>At what point
will Romano become demoralized?</i>

01:22.821 --> 01:26.257
<i>Now Nord lands a left hook,
it's Romano that's in trouble.</i>

01:26.259 --> 01:28.992
<i>Romano is holding on.
Romano is swaying.</i>

01:28.994 --> 01:32.129
<i>It's Romano's legs that are
wobbly now. It's Romano's legs</i>

01:32.131 --> 01:34.864
<i>that are unsteady.
And Nord is on the attack.</i>

01:34.866 --> 01:38.100
<i>He's taking some heavy shots
again in the round,</i>

01:38.102 --> 01:40.369
<i>and there's four to level
and he has ninety to go.</i>

01:40.371 --> 01:43.305
<i>Joe Romano is on the back foot.
Nord is getting clumsy.</i>

01:43.307 --> 01:48.877
<i>Right hand. Left hook. Big right hand from
Nord, and a left hook, and a right hand.</i>

01:48.879 --> 01:50.978
<i>Joe Romano
is in desperate trouble.</i>

01:50.980 --> 01:56.019
<i>And the referee, the referee's
saying... He waves it all off.</i>

01:56.787 --> 02:01.156
<i>Joe Romano protests, at the midway
section of the ninth round.</i>

02:01.158 --> 02:03.290
<i>Joe Romano cannot believe it.</i>

02:03.292 --> 02:06.160
<i>A flurry of punches
on the ropes just above us.</i>

02:06.162 --> 02:08.895
<i>Where Kim Nord looked
to be losing this fight</i>

02:08.896 --> 02:12.299
<i>he produced a warrior instinct</i>

02:12.301 --> 02:17.038
<i>around this arena
Kim Nord has held him off.</i>

02:24.179 --> 02:28.182
Maybe he was

<i>Hey, you've

15:55.061 --> 15:57.127
Why don't you let me
fix this for you?

15:57.129 --> 16:01.365
Come on, Joey? You're not
gonna try to hustle a hustler?

16:01.967 --> 16:05.935
No, no, listen, I need them...
I need $40, man. I need $40. OK?

16:05.937 --> 16:08.070
You know how it is.
You know what I'm saying?

16:08.072 --> 16:10.940
Really? This, this is
what it's come to for you?

16:10.942 --> 16:16.411
No, listen, no man, no. I got my own spot,
I got a junkyard on 45th and Pico, OK?

16:16.413 --> 16:19.048
Alright, well, maybe I'll
come by. Maybe we'll fix that.

16:19.050 --> 16:21.082

16:23.186 --> 16:25.954
- Yeah. I need the money, Jimmy.
- I think... No, no.

16:25.956 --> 16:28.089
They ain't gonna let you
do that here, man.

16:28.091 --> 16:30.024
What are you talking about?
I've got my tools in my car.

16:30.026 --> 16:32.491
I'm gonna fucking add some
black, some primer paint, boom.

16:32.493 --> 16:36.964
And I'll fix this right now.
Come on, Jimmy? Come on, Jimmy?

16:36.966 --> 16:40.936
- Come on, man?
- Alright, alright. On one condition.

16:41.937 --> 16:43.502
- Name it.
- Yeah?

16:43.504 --> 16:44.737
Yeah?

16:44.739 --> 16:46.107
You get yourself straight.

16:48.109 --> 16:51.110
I'm talking about
from right now, right now.

16:51.112 --> 16:53.145
Jimmy, don't play me
for a fucking child, man.

16:53.147 --> 16:56.480
- Don't play that...
- No, hey, hey. I'm serious.

16:56.482 --> 17:00.652
From right now, this moment,
you get on the path. Yes or no?

17:00.654 --> 17:03.090
From this moment on,
you're straight?

17:05.791 --> 17:08.527
OK, deal. Deal, deal.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.396
I need to get my tools.
I'm going to get my tools.

17:17.502 --> 17:20.869
- Take me ten minutes. Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

17:20.872 --> 17:22.070
- Yeah.
- Alright.

17:22.073 --> 17:25.111
- Let me do it.
- Yeah.

17:26.743 --> 17:28.144
- I got to call.
- Alright.

17:28.146 --> 17:30.046
- I'll be over here.
- Ten minutes, Jimmy.

17:30.048 --> 17:32.016
- Yeah, uh-hm.
- I love you, man.

18:09.017 --> 18:12.653
Yo, Jimmy?
Come look at this, man.

18:16.724 --> 18:18.592
- That's it?
- Yeah.

18:19.227 --> 18:24.296
- That's it? What is that?
- That's wax.

18:24.298 --> 18:27.467
- I got to let that set.
- No, what is that job, man? I mean...

18:30.537 --> 18:35.640
- You... What?
- That's a half ass job if I ever saw one.

18:35.642 --> 18:37.908
- That's not half ass.
- Well, it ain't done.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.576
- Yes, it is.
- Joe, there is...

18:39.578 --> 18:44.083
There's two kinds
of people in this world. Right?

18:45.084 --> 18:49.885
There's the hedonists
and then there's the stoics.

18:49.887 --> 18:54.224
The hedonists, they'll do whatever
he can fucking do to feel good.

18:54.226 --> 18:58.229
Stoic does what is right,
no matter how he feels.

19:00.565 --> 19:03.965
I don't know what the fuck
you just said, OK?

19:03.967 --> 19:05.968
But that's damn good
for a street job.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.136
It's my point exactly.

19:08.138 --> 19:10.572
You've got some bull shit excuse
for everything you do.

19:10.574 --> 19:14.175
And you've probably lived your whole
life like that as far as I know.

19:14.177 --> 19:17.012
You know, I like you, man.
I always have, but...

19:17.014 --> 19:20.883
You got your head stuck so far up
your ass you can't even see straight.

19:22.885 --> 19:24.020
You need help.

19:26.355 --> 19:28.523
I don't know where
you're going to get it.

19:29.792 --> 19:33.161
You better get it. Thanks.

19:53.147 --> 19:56.082
Fuck you, man. Fuck you, Jimmy.

20:17.969 --> 20:19.904
<i>Tommy.</i>

20:22.740 --> 20:24.642
<i>Tommy, can you hear me?</i>

20:26.744 --> 20:31.879
<i>...condition to the globe trauma and
we were able to reattach it with the one...</i>

20:31.881 --> 20:34.149
Unfortunately by the time
we were able to operate, it was...

20:34.151 --> 20:39.821
- What exactly are you saying?
- The prognosis for Tommy's vision is not good.

20:39.823 --> 20:43.626
It will be less than the legal limit for
blindness if he has any sight at all.

20:47.197 --> 20:49.332
Baby, please,
say something.

21:21.761 --> 21:23.795
What are you smoking?
Give me this shit.

21:23.797 --> 21:26.230
This shit, ship right up
to your fucking ass.

21:26.232 --> 21:28.767
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Fuck all, y'all.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.121
- Oh, I don't know.
- Shit out this, my nigga.

21:52.123 --> 21:54.323
- That old nigga is dead.
- Hell, yes.

21:54.325 --> 21:56.858
- What the fuck, nigga?
- We are old.

21:56.860 --> 21:59.761
- What the hell you think you're doing against my truck, man?
- OK, OK, OK, man.

21:59.763 --> 22:02.497
- Listen, look. Alright.
- Yo, this motherfucker.

22:02.499 --> 22:04.732

23:07.327 --> 23:10.160

- That's why I keep shitting my kids name, niggas.

23:10.162 --> 23:12.495
Shit just like this happens.

23:12.497 --> 23:17.066
Hmm. Yeah, motherfucker.

Hey, what's your name?

23:43.093 --> 23:45.092
Schumacher, nigga, Schumacher.

23:47.530 --> 23:48.831
Fuck y'all, dudes.

23:51.333 --> 23:55.035
Hold up, hold up.
Where's my $40?

23:55.037 --> 23:58.371
You thought, you could hustle us, huh?
How I know you didn't destruct

23:58.373 --> 24:02.275
my car while I was inside, huh?
Not a bad scam.

24:02.277 --> 24:06.512
Alright, Shawn. Leave that
faggot ass Shoemaker alone. Let's go.

24:06.514 --> 24:10.849
Hold on. I fixed your truck,
give me my 40 bucks.

24:10.851 --> 24:14.521
I didn't tell you do shit,
homie. You asked out.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.123
- Hey!
- Oh shit.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.558

- Shit.

24:23.029 --> 24:27.931

- Shoot his ass, fuck. Go ahead.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.268
Here's your shit, man.

24:30.436 --> 24:31.868
Fuck!

24:34.139 --> 24:35.872
Come on, let's go.

24:35.874 --> 24:39.210
Ah! Shit. Fuck.

24:47.552 --> 24:51.255
Get him! Get him, man.
Get him. Damn!

25:08.970 --> 25:11.305
Now, hold on, and just let
me know if you feel anything.

25:11.307 --> 25:13.174
- OK.
- Alright?

25:13.176 --> 25:14.576
- I'm all good.
- OK.

25:19.147 --> 25:20.215
How does it look, Doc?

25:21.817 --> 25:25.085
Uh, the stitches are actually quite good.
There's only very minimal scarring.

25:25.087 --> 25:28.087
- OK.
- So, we're gonna do a vision test now, Tommy.

25:28.089 --> 25:30.956
All I need you to do is let me
know when you see the light.

25:30.958 --> 25:33.594
OK? Just let me know when
you see the light.

25:35.029 --> 25:38.865
I got nothing. Maybe my... Maybe my
eyes are just adjusting or something.

25:42.068 --> 25:43.036
Uh.

25:44.337 --> 25:46.940
- Sorry, Tommy, I'm just gonna take a couple of those.
- OK.

25:49.942 --> 25:54.880
So... There is no perception
of visible light in either eye.

25:56.215 --> 25:58.081
Yeah, but then... What's that?

25:58.083 --> 26:00.585
Right now, but maybe in a week
or something I'll be good, uh?

26:00.587 --> 26:02.952
- Tommy...
- Stressed up.

26:02.954 --> 26:04.223
You're blind.

26:05.557 --> 26:10.059
No, no, no. And I'm not willing
to accept that, Doctor. No way.

26:10.061 --> 26:15.065
No, I'm really sorry, Tommy, but it is my job,
my duty, to give you the medical facts, alright?

26:16.200 --> 26:20.435
This is... You had a long-standing
of macular detachment in both eyes.

26:20.437 --> 26:22.370
This is... This is irreversible.

26:22.372 --> 26:25.075
Yeah, yeah, no, Doctor,
it's not, OK?

26:26.175 --> 26:29.110
It's not irreversible because I'm gonna
be champion of the world, alright.

26:29.112 --> 26:32.479
I'm not gonna, not gonna
sit around being fucking blind.

26:32.481 --> 26:34.616
I'm gonna get my eyes fixed up,
I'm gonna get my rematch,

26:34.618 --> 26:36.751
I'm gonna win my fight,
that's what I do.

26:36.753 --> 26:38.354
I'm a fighter, Doc.

26:39.555 --> 26:42.425
- Good luck with that rematch, Tommy.
- Thank you.

27:11.150 --> 27:15.152
- Hello.
- <i>You have a collect call from Los Angeles County Jail,</i>

27:15.154 --> 27:18.559
<i>if you'd like to accept
this call, please press one.</i>

27:27.098 --> 27:28.099
Catherine.

27:30.770 --> 27:31.969
Joe.

27:35.307 --> 27:37.541
Listen, I need a favor, OK?

27:39.076 --> 27:42.481
- What do you want?
- I need you to bail me out.

27:43.347 --> 27:45.581
<i>You're in jail?</i>

27:45.583 --> 27:49.751
Yeah, I got jumped, OK?
It was self-defense.

27:49.753 --> 27:52.788
- <i>Joe, are you're drinking again?</i>
- What does that matter?

27:52.790 --> 27:55.790
I just need to know.
Are you drinking again?

27:55.792 --> 27:59.293
Listen, I'm gonna pay you back, OK?
Give me a little bit of time.

27:59.295 --> 28:01.561
- Alright?
- This isn't about the money, Joe.

28:01.563 --> 28:03.698
It's always about
the money with you.

28:03.700 --> 28:06.467
<i>I cannot handle
your bullshit right now.</i>

28:06.469 --> 28:09.471
Goddammit!
I have to go take care of Tommy.

28:10.339 --> 28:11.774
<i>What happened to Tommy?</i>

28:13.842 --> 28:15.744
Catherine,
what happened to Tommy?

28:23.719 --> 28:29.624
- Catherine, what the fuck happened to Tommy?
- He's blind.

28:31.491 --> 28:35.360
Tommy is... Tommy is blind.

28:40.534 --> 28:42.569
I'll talk to Gary.

29:13.797 --> 29:17.265
Tommy, Tommy, did you plan
to beat him in that last fight?

29:17.267 --> 29:20.134
What do you plan on doing
now that your career is over?

29:20.136 --> 29:23.605
Who said my career is over? I'll fight
tonight if you get me a rematch.

29:23.607 --> 29:26.473
So, you're planning to return to
boxing, Tommy? In what capacity?

29:26.475 --> 29:29.778
Full capacity. Full capacity.
To quote the great Jack Dempsey:

29:29.780 --> 29:33.212
"A true champion is someone
who gets up when they can't."

29:34.817 --> 29:37.786
OK, guys.
Come on, fighter. Yeah, come on.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.993
- Joe.
- I came to see Tommy.

32:46.995 --> 32:49.061
Hi, OK. He's sleep... Hey, Joe.

32:49.063 --> 32:51.096
- Joe. He's sleeping right now.
- Where is he? Is he up?

32:51.098 --> 32:53.499
I unders... I understand.
He's sleeping right now.

32:53.501 --> 32:56.000
I need to see him.

32:56.002 --> 32:59.470
OK, why... He doesn't... Joe,
he doesn't want to see anyone.

32:59.472 --> 33:01.839
- No?
- No. Why don't you just go, clean yourself up

33:01.841 --> 33:03.009
and you can stop by tomorrow.

33:04.544 --> 33:07.346
- No, no, I need to see him. No, I need to see him.
- Joe, please don't... Joe!

33:08.514 --> 33:09.815
Tommy!

33:15.120 --> 33:17.754
- I'm so fucked.
- Joe, get away from me.

33:17.756 --> 33:19.889
Listen, listen. Are you OK?

33:19.891 --> 33:21.925
- Get away from me. Joe, stop!
- No, listen to me.

33:21.927 --> 33:24.928
Listen to me, listen to me,
listen to me. Are you OK?

33:24.930 --> 33:28.399
- That was an accident. That was an accident.
- Joe, please, get out. Get out!

33:29.000 --> 33:32.902
I did... I didn't mean to do that. That
was not what... I didn't... I can't...

33:32.904 --> 33:34.972
Get out of my house.

33:37.474 --> 33:40.811
Hey! Get out.

33:41.678 --> 33:43.912
- I'm gonna wait outside, I'm waiting outside.
- Yeah, hey. Goodbye, Joe.

33:43.914 --> 33:46.983
- I'm gonna wait outside. Tell Tommy I'm waiting outside.
- Goodbye, Joe.

34:10.538 --> 34:13.440
He says you'll have to go,
you have to go.

34:14.007 --> 34:17.775
Joe, you can't show up like
this, so you'll have to leave.

34:17.777 --> 34:19.043
It's the way it is.

34:19.045 --> 34:21.679
- What? What?
- It's the way it is.

34:21.681 --> 34:26.516
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Alright, go! Get the fuck out of here, don't piss me off.

34:26.518 --> 34:31.690
I'm fucking gone. Hey, I'm not your
fucking stray fucking dog, OK?

34:32.592 --> 34:36.829
OK. You can't even fucking shut
your own trillion dollar door.

35:13.662 --> 35:14.962
<i>Hey, Joe, you got to go, man.</i>

35:14.964 --> 35:16.697
<i>You look like fucking shit.</i>

35:16.699 --> 35:19.099
<i>You can't show up
like this. So you have to leave.</i>

35:19.101 --> 35:21.468
<i>You are not welcome here, Joe.</i>

35:21.470 --> 35:23.137
<i>This is what
it's come to for you?</i>

35:23.139 --> 35:24.839
<i>You're a drunk, Dad.
You are a drunk.</i>

35:24.841 --> 35:26.239
<i>Are you drinking again?</i>

35:26.241 --> 35:28.475
<i>Go, get the fuck out of here!</i>

35:28.477 --> 35:30.744
<i>You piss me off.
Joe, get away from me.</i>

35:30.746 --> 35:32.478
<i>Oh my God. We're good.</i>

35:32.480 --> 35:33.479
<i>Get out of here.</i>

35:33.481 --> 35:34.847
<i>You asked out.</i>

35:34.849 --> 35:36.482
<i>You got your head
stuck so far up</i>

35:36.484 --> 35:38.920
<i>your ass you can't
even see straight.</i>

35:41.622 --> 35:42.823
<i>You need help.</i>

35:45.126 --> 35:49.495
<i>I don't know where you're gonna
get it, but you better get it.</i>

38:38.018 --> 38:41.853
Oh, God.

38:41.855 --> 38:43.056
Aw!

38:45.859 --> 38:47.859
Oh, shit, Tommy.

38:47.861 --> 38:50.194
- Oh, man, you scared me.
- Gary?

38:50.196 --> 38:52.163
- You... you OK?
- Yeah. You're OK?

38:52.165 --> 38:53.664
- Tommy.
- Oh, yeah.

38:53.666 --> 38:55.999
- What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.

38:56.001 --> 39:01.438
I... I was just getting some fresh air,
Gary here started screaming like a lunatic.

39:03.108 --> 39:06.809
That's... that's me, Tommy,
that's me. I'm a lunatic.

39:06.811 --> 39:09.212
I want you to put
that thing away.

39:09.214 --> 39:11.749
I don't I wanna even
see it in the house anymore.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.052
- You alright?
- Yes.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.087
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

39:18.089 --> 39:23.859
Nothing. Hey, I was just getting some
water, OK? Just go to sleep, OK?

39:23.861 --> 39:24.961
OK.

39:28.731 --> 39:31.200
What were you doing?

39:33.803 --> 39:36.304
Tommy, if you're having trouble
you got let me help you.

39:36.306 --> 39:39.974
You got to stop
worrying about me, OK?

39:39.976 --> 39:45.311
I'm fine,
I'm fine. Let's go to sleep.

39:45.313 --> 39:49.983
I was just getting some air,
it's OK, alright?

39:49.985 --> 39:55.020
- OK.
- Gary is a crazy lunatic.

39:55.022 --> 39:56.456
- Hey.
- Where you've been?

39:56.458 --> 39:58.224
- I just felt the kick.
- What?

39:58.226 --> 40:00.460
Yeah.

40:00.462 --> 40:02.729
- Did you feel that? Yeah?
- Yeah, I felt it.

40:03.831 --> 40:05.731
- Alright.
- I think, that was a right hand.

40:05.733 --> 40:08.367
I know, he must have been
hitting a heavy bag in there.

40:08.369 --> 40:12.804
Yeah, he's getting ready. He's doing his fight
camp in there, ready to come out, you know.

40:14.107 --> 40:16.009
A champion just like me.

40:17.177 --> 40:19.745
My boy.

40:22.881 --> 40:24.450
Come on, let's go to sleep.

40:47.438 --> 40:48.372
Yo, Darien.

40:52.175 --> 40:53.743
Yo, Darien.

40:59.883 --> 41:00.783
Darien.

41:01.450 --> 41:03.285
Darien, where are you, buddy?

41:12.394 --> 41:13.328
Darien.

41:19.467 --> 41:20.468
Darien.

41:21.803 --> 41:23.238
Where are you, buddy?

41:44.190 --> 41:45.758
Oh, fuck.

42:31.534 --> 42:36.536
- Mia Romano, I like it.
- It's a boy.

42:36.538 --> 42:40.574
I think I like Axel.
Axel Romano.

42:40.576 --> 42:41.908
A strong name.

42:41.910 --> 42:46.079
God, what a name, Axel.
I like it.

42:46.081 --> 42:48.415
Come on.

42:48.417 --> 42:53.488
Come on, don't you just wanna
say it, like all the time. Axel.

42:54.423 --> 42:57.824
- Axel, Axel.
- OK, OK.

42:59.193 --> 43:01.561
Ah.

43:04.197 --> 43:05.865
Oh, uhm...

43:08.301 --> 43:11.035
I think something's happening.

43:11.037 --> 43:12.405
Are you OK?

43:15.542 --> 43:17.277
I think my water just broke.

43:23.415 --> 43:27.049
<i>That's it,
that's it, jab, jab.</i>

43:27.051 --> 43:31.120
<i>One, two. One, two, three.</i>

43:31.122 --> 43:33.989
<i>That's it.
One, two, three, add a hook.</i>

43:33.991 --> 43:37.192
<i>There you go.
You're like a Tommygun.</i>

43:37.194 --> 43:39.328
<i>What's a Tommygun, Daddy?</i>

43:39.330 --> 43:41.130
<i>It's a super powerful gun.</i>

43:41.132 --> 43:42.997
<i>You know what, that's
what I'm going to call you.</i>

43:42.999 --> 43:45.633
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the undisputed,</i>

43:45.635 --> 43:50.204
<i>undefeated heavyweight
champion of the world,</i>

43:50.206 --> 43:55.277
<i>Tommy "Gun" Romano.</i>

44:07.222 --> 44:12.492
Hi, the umbilical cord was wrapped around the
baby's neck cutting off the oxygen supply,

44:12.494 --> 44:15.228
but we managed to stabilize
everything and she's fine.

44:15.230 --> 44:19.364
Oh, my God.
Oh, thank you.

44:19.366 --> 44:21.032
Thank you.

44:21.034 --> 44:22.668
You're welcome. It'll be OK.

44:22.670 --> 44:25.372
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:26.373 --> 44:29.040
Hi.

44:29.042 --> 44:31.645
- Is she sleeping?
- OK, OK.

44:35.616 --> 44:37.615
Oh my god.

44:37.617 --> 44:44.087
- Oh, hi. Look at her. Oh my god, she's beautiful.
- Congratulations.

44:44.089 --> 44:48.527
Thank you.
I didn't do much. It was her.

44:50.629 --> 44:54.999
- Congratulations. She's so pretty. Oh my god.
- Thank you.

44:57.402 --> 44:59.604
Maybe you can give us a minute?

45:00.371 --> 45:04.707
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Thank you, guys.

45:04.709 --> 45:06.010
OK, OK.

45:07.545 --> 45:09.480
I'm gonna get some coffee, OK?

45:12.682 --> 45:13.716
Thank you.

45:15.686 --> 45:17.351
Hey.

45:17.353 --> 45:20.588
- Wow.
- She looks just like her daddy.

45:20.590 --> 45:25.461
- Does she really?
- Well, I mean kind of?

45:27.296 --> 45:32.301
- Wow. I love you.
- I love you too.

45:33.735 --> 45:34.670
Come here.

45:46.414 --> 45:47.515
Ahem.

45:53.321 --> 45:55.455
Feel my heart?

45:57.057 --> 45:58.658
We did good.

46:00.694 --> 46:03.062
- This is nice, huh?
- Uh-hum.

46:04.163 --> 46:08.000
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, babe.

47:10.157 --> 47:13.725
- Hey, your family is right here on the right.
- Oh, it is?

47:13.727 --> 47:15.795
- Right here.
- Some proud grandparents.

47:15.797 --> 47:17.131
Hey, buddy.

47:18.398 --> 47:20.832
Hey, Gary, I was hoping maybe
you could give me a lift home?

47:20.834 --> 47:23.168
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Everything alright?

47:23.170 --> 47:26.472
Yeah, yeah, yes. Everything's fine.
I'm just exhausted. A long night.

47:27.507 --> 47:29.173
I understand.

47:29.175 --> 47:32.275
Alright, I'm going to
stay with Sarah and the baby.

47:32.277 --> 47:33.346
OK.

47:34.581 --> 47:38.682
- I love you so much. I'm so proud of you.
- I love you too.

47:38.684 --> 47:40.818
- Thank you so much.
- OK. Right shoulder, buddy.

47:40.820 --> 47:42.686
- Alright, yes.
- Here we go.

47:42.688 --> 47:44.421
- Gary, your phone.
- Yes.

47:44.423 --> 47:45.555
Please remember
to bring mine back.

47:45.557 --> 47:46.823
It's charging in the kitchen.

47:46.825 --> 47:48.925
- Trust me, I won't forget.
- Alright.

47:48.927 --> 47:50.359
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

47:50.361 --> 47:53.295
- See you soon.
- I love you.

47:53.297 --> 47:54.565
I love you.

48:06.309 --> 48:08.812
- Home sweet home.
- Home sweet home.

48:13.315 --> 48:16.318
Where you at, Gary?

48:17.387 --> 48:21.355
- I'm right here. Found me?
- Yes, where you at?

48:21.357 --> 48:23.958
- I got you.
- Alright, we're gonna step down, kiddo.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.792
- OK.
- Got it?

48:25.794 --> 48:28.227
- Yeah, I'm good.
- OK, good.

48:28.229 --> 48:32.365
- One more, big guy.
- You're like my seeing eye dog, you know.

48:32.367 --> 48:34.533
I'll call you Bruno or
something from now on.

48:34.535 --> 48:36.234
OK, I'll go with that.

48:36.236 --> 48:38.203
Alright, right here, big guy,
right here.

48:38.205 --> 48:40.506
- We have a couch?
- Yes, just have a sit.

48:40.508 --> 48:43.608
Oh, yes. Thank you.

48:43.610 --> 48:47.479
Alright, buddy, well, I'll come back
and get you whenever you're ready, OK?

48:47.481 --> 48:49.483
- Sounds good.
- Alright.

48:50.484 --> 48:52.886
- Oh, and pal?
- Yeah?

48:53.620 --> 48:57.956
- You're a dad.
- It's crazy.

48:57.958 --> 48:59.158
It's awesome.

48:59.793 --> 49:01.927
- See you, buddy.
- We'll see you.

49:41.799 --> 49:44.932
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

49:44.934 --> 49:48.968
<i>hailing from Los Angeles,</i>

49:48.970 --> 49:54.541
<i>with a record of 16 wins,
zero losses,</i>

49:54.543 --> 49:58.680
<i>Tommy "Gun" Romano.</i>

51:19.054 --> 51:22.858
Oh, shit. Fuck.

51:24.492 --> 51:28.029
Why can't you just
keep your phone on you, honey?

52:03.528 --> 52:04.696
Hi.

52:06.665 --> 52:08.066
Where's Tommy?

52:39.963 --> 52:41.562
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey.

52:41.564 --> 52:42.863
- What's going on?
- What's up?

52:42.865 --> 52:44.464
Nothing much. Just uh...

52:44.466 --> 52:47.534
- Where's Tommy?
- He's just sleeping. Sleeping.

52:47.536 --> 52:48.902
OK, wake him up.
Time to roll up.

52:48.904 --> 52:50.569
Now wake him up.-

52:50.571 --> 52:53.106
Fuck you. Don't fucking
look at me like that.

52:53.108 --> 52:55.107
- Don't fuck...
- No, just relax don't...

52:55.109 --> 52:56.809
Don't fucking
look at me like that.

52:56.811 --> 52:57.710
I'll roll you right now...

53:02.817 --> 53:04.384
Tommy!

53:07.221 --> 53:10.788
Tommy. Tommy. Tommy.

53:10.790 --> 53:15.727
Tommy, are you there?
Tommy. Tommy. Tommy!

53:15.729 --> 53:19.732
Tommy! No!

53:23.203 --> 53:29.172
No, no! What did you do?
What did you do?

53:29.174 --> 53:32.978
What did you do?
What did you do?

53:46.758 --> 53:49.192
Come back, please.

55:24.613 --> 55:27.648
- Please open up, Jimmy.
- Is that Joey?

55:27.650 --> 55:28.985
Yeah, it's me.

55:30.619 --> 55:34.891
- Joey, it's late I'm...
- Can you please open?

55:40.763 --> 55:44.599
I said you needed help, but
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

55:50.605 --> 55:54.674
Let it out.
Let it all out. Don't hold back.

55:57.879 --> 56:01.648
You gotta get every drop in there,
otherwise you're gonna be cleaning it up.

56:06.619 --> 56:07.618
Here you go.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.220
Oh...

56:09.222 --> 56:11.855
It's good.

57:04.373 --> 57:07.175
OK, man, this is chicken broth.

57:09.678 --> 57:11.214
You have to get it down.

57:13.914 --> 57:15.348
That's good.

57:15.350 --> 57:18.350
- Now help feed yourself, come on.
- Yes.

57:18.352 --> 57:23.225
Let me make something crystal
fucking clear to you right now.

57:24.091 --> 57:27.025
I'm not doing this for you.
This is for me.

57:27.027 --> 57:30.695
This is God's will.
He's working through me.

57:30.697 --> 57:33.867
I'm just the messenger here
and this is your God's shot.

57:34.701 --> 57:39.003
I don't deserve any another shot.

57:39.005 --> 57:41.205
Now you're
majorly whisking this.

57:41.207 --> 57:44.207
This is just about to make me vomit.
Why don't you just man up?

57:44.209 --> 57:49.980
I know that you've got what they call
fisher king wound and you've got in spades.

57:49.982 --> 57:51.348
You don't even know
what happened.

57:51.350 --> 57:54.250
You know, I don't give
a fuck what happened.

57:54.252 --> 57:56.386
What's important is
what are you gonna do about it?

57:56.388 --> 58:00.322
You know what happens to other
motherfuckers like us who drink?

58:00.324 --> 58:02.760
We are rendered female.

58:03.394 --> 58:07.996
And the alcohol just knocks the logical
mind right out of our fucking heads.

58:07.998 --> 58:12.267
When we turn into blubbering little
wussies, just like you are now.

58:12.269 --> 58:15.737
"Oh, why did the whole world do
this to me, who did this to me.

58:15.739 --> 58:17.071
Why? I can't do that.

58:17.073 --> 58:18.939
I couldn't get,
couldn't do this."

58:18.941 --> 58:21.109
Like what do you got?
A fucking vagina in there?

58:21.111 --> 58:22.179
Fuck you.

58:24.313 --> 58:28.048
Yeah, fuck me.
Yeah, fuck me, right.

58:28.050 --> 58:29.419
No, fuck you.

58:32.154 --> 58:34.154
Do something about yourself.

58:34.156 --> 58:36.024
As I said to you before,

58:36.991 --> 58:39.892
you got to do good to feel good.

58:39.894 --> 58:45.231
You don't go out, get all fucking
high and feel good to do good.

58:45.233 --> 58:48.268
That don't work bro, not at all.

58:50.237 --> 58:53.139
It's spiritual teachings
of Marcus Aurelius.

58:53.141 --> 58:55.907
- You read it?
- No.

58:55.909 --> 58:59.146
How... Why does that surprise me?

59:02.282 --> 59:05.185
If it isn't true, don't say it.

59:07.320 --> 59:09.420
If it's not right, don't do it.

59:09.422 --> 59:11.088
Maybe, you ought to
get that tattooed

59:11.090 --> 59:13.191
on your skinny
little fucking chest.

59:13.959 --> 59:18.061
Oh, it's called an alchemical
process, by the way.

59:18.063 --> 59:23.999
You have to burn from the inside
to the outside to get to the gold.

59:24.001 --> 59:25.968
Reading ain't gonna fix this.

59:25.970 --> 59:29.341
You know, motherfucker,
I got news for you.

59:30.307 --> 59:35.311
You came to me.
You showed up on my doorstep.

59:35.313 --> 59:38.280
You got me involved.
Now you're in country.

59:38.282 --> 59:40.482
You're in Vietnam,
you're little soldier boy

59:40.484 --> 59:45.221
who's gonna start to fucking
step, right now. Right now!

59:48.056 --> 59:50.293
Boom. Wake up.

59:51.995 --> 59:55.831
Fucker. Candy ass twerk.

01:00:09.176 --> 01:00:12.113
<i>Better keep it tight.</i>

01:00:21.522 --> 01:00:24.188
- <i>There you go.</i>
- <i>With the left.</i>

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:26.159
<i>One, two, yeah.</i>

01:00:37.903 --> 01:00:40.272
<i>Argh! Ah!</i>

01:00:41.173 --> 01:00:42.541
<i>Oh!</i>

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:18.038
- You play against yourself?
- Yeah.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.912
If you do not conquer self, you
will be conquered by yourself.

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:26.615
Napoleon Hill,
he's on the shelf.

01:01:52.539 --> 01:01:54.972
- Wanna play?
- Does a bear shit in the woods?

01:01:54.974 --> 01:01:57.208
- Oh, you're an asshole?
- Yeah, come on.

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.911
Really? OK, bring it.

01:02:04.951 --> 01:02:06.918
Alright.

01:02:11.224 --> 01:02:12.624
Choose your side.

01:02:18.028 --> 01:02:21.232
No, Joey, choose your side.

01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:26.036
What? I just did.
What does it matter?

01:02:28.506 --> 01:02:31.172
OK, it doesn't matter?

01:02:31.174 --> 01:02:32.309
Yeah.

01:02:33.544 --> 01:02:36.346
You just ain't getting it,
are you?

01:02:42.284 --> 01:02:44.587
Do you wanna fucking
play chess or what?

01:02:45.755 --> 01:02:49.489
Yeah, I'll play you
when you're ready.

01:02:49.491 --> 01:02:54.696
- I am ready.
- No, you ain't.

01:03:38.303 --> 01:03:41.204
"Law: The Universe will give
back action for action..."

01:03:47.612 --> 01:03:51.414
Here we must look one step ahead
and guard against the danger

01:03:51.416 --> 01:03:54.585
of accepting surrender
as a sort of...

01:04:23.745 --> 01:04:24.779
I'm out of here.

01:04:26.448 --> 01:04:28.316
Yeah? Where are you gonna go?

01:04:29.117 --> 01:04:35.121
- It doesn't matter.
- Wow, man.

01:04:38.092 --> 01:04:41.727
Do you know there has been a real
shift in your consciousness?

01:04:41.729 --> 01:04:43.764
Whether you believe that or not.

01:04:44.598 --> 01:04:47.367
You've got nine days sober
as of today.

01:04:48.835 --> 01:04:52.370
Nine days, yeah?
Did you know that?

01:04:52.372 --> 01:04:54.607
- Yeah.
- Nine days, not bad.

01:04:57.242 --> 01:04:59.478
You could be a potent person.

01:05:00.646 --> 01:05:03.582
You might even
deserve another shot.

01:05:05.249 --> 01:05:06.451
Maybe.

01:05:07.753 --> 01:05:11.153
But I don't think
your balls have dropped yet.

01:05:11.155 --> 01:05:13.389
You know what? You know what? Who
the fuck do you think you are

01:05:13.391 --> 01:05:15.659
talking to me like that? Huh?

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:18.729
I'll fucking smash you right here
and nobody will even know about it.

01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:27.070
When I let go of what I am,
I become what I might be.

01:05:38.548 --> 01:05:40.450
You've cracked the code.

01:05:42.551 --> 01:05:44.253
Cracked it wide open.

01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:47.488
You've just got to
learn how to decipher it.

01:05:48.456 --> 01:05:51.491
Who where I turn this.

01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:54.226
Who where I turn this.

01:05:54.228 --> 01:05:57.563
Who where I turn this.

01:05:57.565 --> 01:06:00.434
It means you turn a boy...

01:06:02.302 --> 01:06:07.238
In psychological terms, it means
an older man whose emotional life

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:12.144
has remained in an adolescent stage.
Sounds familiar, kiddo?

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:20.686
Was that a sigh?

01:06:22.188 --> 01:06:24.690
That's good. That's the sigh
of acknowledgment.

01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:26.726
That's good.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.901
- I don't have anything left.
- Oh God, do you know, your lack of self confidence

01:06:38.903 --> 01:06:42.571
is just it's...
It's putrefying, really is.

01:06:42.573 --> 01:06:47.243
Just, you know, get off your ass
man. You know, are you a loser?

01:06:48.345 --> 01:06:49.778
- No.
- No?

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.381
- No.
- You're not the joke that they

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.482
all think that you are?

01:06:54.484 --> 01:06:57.186
- No.
- No? I don't believe you.

01:06:58.522 --> 01:07:01.288
Are you willing to take action?

01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:04.659
Are you just gonna leave here now
and go right back where you were?

01:07:04.661 --> 01:07:07.460
Go out there cry,
feel sorry for yourself?

01:07:07.462 --> 01:07:09.430
I'm gonna do something about it.

01:07:09.432 --> 01:07:11.998
Yeah? OK, well, then do it.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.502
Do the actual footwork
that is necessary.

01:07:15.504 --> 01:07:16.505
OK.

01:07:17.673 --> 01:07:21.275
- The rest you leave to the gods and goddesses.
- OK.

01:08:49.724 --> 01:08:53.725
And he said, <i>"Todo</i> right? I
thought you said <i>todo</i> fight."

01:08:57.397 --> 01:09:00.363
So, since when do they let
homeless people in here, huh?

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:12.843
- You took the fucking padding off.
- What? Oh.

01:09:12.845 --> 01:09:14.712
Hey, Joe. Can we get
you a drink?

01:09:14.714 --> 01:09:15.747
Grab a chair. Why don't you sit?

01:09:16.983 --> 01:09:21.286
- No, Ray, I don't drink.
- You now?

01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:27.890
He had some very heavy hands back
in the day. Very heavy hands.

01:09:27.893 --> 01:09:29.358
By the way,
I'm very sorry about your loss.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.795
Don't you fucking
play games with me, Ray.

01:09:31.796 --> 01:09:34.029
Don't you fucking
play games with me.

01:09:34.032 --> 01:09:36.965
They took the goddamn
padding out of those gloves.

01:09:36.966 --> 01:09:39.135
They fucking blinded my son.

01:09:39.136 --> 01:09:42.502
They blinded him.
They ended his career, his life.

01:09:42.505 --> 01:09:45.774
I'm telling the whole fucking world about
it, unless you do something for me

01:09:45.776 --> 01:09:48.709
- and you're gonna do it right now.
- And what am I supposed to do?

01:09:48.711 --> 01:09:51.578
You're going to give me his fucking
rematch. That's what you're going to do.

01:09:51.581 --> 01:09:55.652
- Look, I can't do that.
- Bullshit. You can do anything.

01:09:56.519 --> 01:09:59.054
You know, you look like
you could use a few bucks.

01:09:59.888 --> 01:10:01.788
You name it. How much?

01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:03.392
Right here.

01:10:09.898 --> 01:10:13.401
Really?
You sure you wanna do this?

01:10:16.437 --> 01:10:20.706
- You got a problem here?
- I don't know, maybe.

01:10:20.708 --> 01:10:24.810
This is Joe Romano. Tommy's dad.

01:10:24.812 --> 01:10:27.682
- So?
- So he wants to fight you.

01:10:30.116 --> 01:10:31.718
I'll fight him.

01:10:33.954 --> 01:10:39.824
Wow, wow, wow. Save it for the ring. At
least, let me sell some tickets, huh?

01:10:39.826 --> 01:10:43.729
OK, Joe, you get your fight.
You got 30 days.

01:11:19.595 --> 01:11:21.999
That's all you got?

01:11:43.818 --> 01:11:45.885
The worse you look,
the better you are.

01:11:45.887 --> 01:11:48.555
You look like shit.

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.427
Rome wasn't built in a day.

01:11:58.265 --> 01:12:01.666
<i>Joe, you called me
yesterday, you call me today.</i>

01:12:01.668 --> 01:12:02.970
<i>Stop calling me.</i>

01:12:15.048 --> 01:12:18.915
<i>You think you lost Tommy. I
lost Tommy too. He was my son too.</i>

01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:22.187
<i>Stop calling me, Joe.
Stop calling me.</i>

01:12:33.631 --> 01:12:36.067
<i>Give me one good reason why
I should do this for you, Joe.</i>

01:12:37.969 --> 01:12:43.106
<i>You're not doing this for me.
You're doing this for Tommy.</i>

01:13:00.756 --> 01:13:04.926
Come on man. OK, OK.

01:13:20.741 --> 01:13:24.111
<i>Joe, there's... There's two
kinds of people in this world.</i>

01:13:26.213 --> 01:13:31.985
<i>There's the hedonists
and then there's the stoics.</i>

01:13:33.652 --> 01:13:38.288
<i>The hedonists, they do whatever
they can fucking do to feel good.</i>

01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:42.627
<i>Stoic does what's right,
no matter how it feels.</i>

01:13:50.835 --> 01:13:52.070
<i>Come on!</i>

01:13:56.241 --> 01:13:58.707
- <i>Are you a looser?</i>
- Six, seven.

01:13:58.709 --> 01:14:02.146
<i>You're not the joke that
they all think that you are.</i>

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:07.317
<i>You could be important person.</i>

01:14:09.286 --> 01:14:12.887
<i>You might even
deserve another shot.</i>

01:14:12.889 --> 01:14:14.291
Come on!

01:14:19.028 --> 01:14:20.694
There you go.

01:14:53.693 --> 01:14:58.064
<i>If you do not conquer self,
you will be conquered by yourself.</i>

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:34.761
Thanks, Jim. I'm here with a man with the
Midas touch, also known as Mr. Ray Bruno.

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:37.899
Now tell me, Mr. Bruno, why would you
let a fight like this take place?

01:15:37.901 --> 01:15:41.702
Well it's America, baby.
And if you believe in yourself,

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:45.440
anything's possible, huh?
Ha, ha, ha...

01:15:45.442 --> 01:15:49.311
OK, well, if that doesn't sum it
up, what does? Jim, back to you.

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:09.764
Hey, Joe.

01:16:18.272 --> 01:16:20.740
I think you should have this.

01:16:26.179 --> 01:16:28.447
- Thank you, Jim.
- Ah.

01:16:31.951 --> 01:16:36.188
- Wanna get me a minute alone?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure. Take your time.

01:18:24.254 --> 01:18:26.323
<i>When I let go of what I am...</i>

01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:31.528
<i>I become what I might be.</i>

01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:40.334
Let's get ready for
an exciting fight tonight.

01:18:40.336 --> 01:18:47.473
Introducing the challenger, with a

in the ring in almost 20 years.

01:18:53.114 --> 01:18:59.552
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joe Romano!

01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:05.057
And now,
ladies and gentlemen

01:19:05.059 --> 01:19:08.894

- Justo! Justo!

01:19:19.339 --> 01:19:21.439
Justo! Justo!

01:19:21.441 --> 01:19:23.942
OK, guys, bring them in.

01:19:27.313 --> 01:19:32.282
Gentlemen, you received your instructions in
the dressing room. I want a good clean fight.

01:19:32.284 --> 01:19:35.652
Obey my commands at all times, above
all, protect yourselves at all times.

01:19:35.654 --> 01:19:39.456
- Touch 'em up, I said touch 'em up.
- Go.

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:42.193
Justo! Justo! Justo!

01:20:02.278 --> 01:20:05.078
<i>I think he's just throwing
again. I think he saw a ghost over there.</i>

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:09.486
<i>That's sweet, you know what I mean. This is,
you know... I can't take this seriously.</i>

01:20:37.411 --> 01:20:40.447
- Oh. Oh.
- <i>What a left.</i>

01:21:30.326 --> 01:21:31.427
Come on!

01:21:47.609 --> 01:21:50.109
<i>What happened to Tommy?</i>

01:21:50.111 --> 01:21:53.078
<i>I cannot handle
your bullshit right now.</i>

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.083
<i>It's just that I have
to go take care of Tommy.</i>

01:21:56.751 --> 01:21:58.717
<i>Cathy, what happened to Tommy?</i>

01:22:30.616 --> 01:22:33.617
<i>It seems like the
progress is amateur at this point.</i>

01:22:33.619 --> 01:22:37.219
<i>Yes, left, right body shots.</i>

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:55.605
Break! Break!

01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:02.242
<i>Joe, are you
a punching bag or something?</i>

01:23:02.244 --> 01:23:04.645
<i>Who where I turn this?</i>

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:06.780
<i>Who where I turn this?</i>

01:23:06.782 --> 01:23:09.516
<i>That means an older man
whose emotional life</i>

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:12.385
<i>has remained
at an adolescent stage.</i>

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:17.122
<i>Sound familiar, kiddo?
You got to do good to feel good.</i>

01:23:17.124 --> 01:23:21.561
<i>Do not give a fuck what's happened, what's
important is what are you gonna do about it.</i>

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:24.563
<i>You have to burn from the inside</i>

01:23:24.565 --> 01:23:26.832
<i>to the outside
to get to the gold.</i>

01:23:37.376 --> 01:23:41.714
<i>You've cracked
the code, cracked it wide open.</i>

01:23:43.249 --> 01:23:45.551
<i>You just got to learn
how to decipher it.</i>

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:56.695
Look at me.
What's wrong with you?

01:23:58.395 --> 01:24:02.231
You are going to go in there
and you're going to finish him.

01:24:02.233 --> 01:24:05.235
You understand me? Finish him.

01:24:06.437 --> 01:24:07.772
Finish him!

01:24:21.719 --> 01:24:24.184
Come on, dude. You're
blowing this fight.

01:24:24.186 --> 01:24:26.487
Throw some punches. Work on your
body. Break him down.

01:24:26.489 --> 01:24:29.656
You're a better fighter, man.
Look at me, look at me.

01:24:29.658 --> 01:24:32.560
Show me something, please. Get in there.
Work this out. Come on.

01:24:57.284 --> 01:25:00.787
- <i>Referee is now starting the count.</i>
- Oh.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:07.324
One, two, three,

01:25:07.326 --> 01:25:11.261
four, five, six,

01:25:11.263 --> 01:25:14.834
seven, eight, nine.

01:25:15.769 --> 01:25:17.000
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:25:17.002 --> 01:25:19.672
- You want to continue?
- Yes.

01:25:23.841 --> 01:25:25.709
Come on. You got
to work with your body.

01:25:25.711 --> 01:25:27.376
You got to work it out.
You got to move your head.

01:25:27.378 --> 01:25:28.613
Be focused.

01:25:42.993 --> 01:25:44.227
Fight!

01:26:03.311 --> 01:26:06.781
- One!
- <i>You're a drunk, Dad. You're a drunk.</i>

01:26:07.582 --> 01:26:11.753
Two. Three.

01:26:13.988 --> 01:26:15.954
<i>Argh!</i>

01:26:15.956 --> 01:26:19.992
Four. Five.

01:26:26.366 --> 01:26:27.932
Six.

01:26:27.934 --> 01:26:30.601
<i>You're in Vietnam.
You're a little soldier boy</i>

01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:35.575
<i>who's gonna start to fucking
step right now. Right now!</i>

01:26:36.442 --> 01:26:37.510
Seven.

01:26:38.678 --> 01:26:41.578
<i>Get off your ass, man.
Are you a loser?</i>

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.317
<i>You're not the joke that
they all think that you are?</i>

01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:48.051
Eight.

01:26:48.053 --> 01:26:51.387
<i>When I let go
of what I am,</i>

01:26:51.389 --> 01:26:53.758
<i>I become what I might be.</i>

01:26:54.592 --> 01:26:55.894
Gloves.

01:26:57.328 --> 01:26:58.560
You good?

01:26:58.562 --> 01:27:00.364
- You want to go on?
- Yes.

01:27:01.332 --> 01:27:03.899
<i>Stop the fight, guys.</i>

01:27:03.901 --> 01:27:07.636
<i>There is blood oozing into his
eyes and down the right side of his cheek.</i>

01:27:07.638 --> 01:27:09.740
<i>Right now, a moan mostly.</i>

01:27:10.907 --> 01:27:11.841
You two.

01:27:13.476 --> 01:27:15.378
OK. Fight!

01:27:33.795 --> 01:27:37.065
Fight back,
fight back, champion. Boom!

01:28:08.527 --> 01:28:11.527

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:20.905
<i>This was something
unbelievable. This is unbelievable.</i>
