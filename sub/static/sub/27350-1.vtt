18:27.834 --> 18:31.667
'A few years pass
and the music not doing so good.

18:31.792 --> 18:35.042
'Fox wanted into the cocaine business.

18:35.167 --> 18:38.584
'And Mr Cheung was that business.'

18:46.626 --> 18:50.792
- But where's your man?
- Don't worry about that, man. He will...

18:50.917 --> 18:52.917
Speak of the devil.

18:53.042 --> 18:54.376
- Hey!
- Forgive me.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.167
- Come on, D.!
- Yeah, man. Me know.

18:56.292 --> 18:59.084
Marcus is more punctual
than a Swiss time piece.

18:59.209 --> 19:02.001
I know, man, I have a Jamaican watch
I'm wearing, Mr Cheung.

19:02.126 --> 19:05.834
- Respect.
- Close that door behind yourself.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.001
My boy, man.

19:17.792 --> 19:19.834
Yo, me brother.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.792
You know me face?

19:23.167 --> 19:25.376
No, man, me no know you.

19:25.501 --> 19:29.542
Yeah, man, me know your face.
Remember you from back in the day.

19:29.667 --> 19:33.417
My question for you, Mr Cheung:
can you distribute my business?

19:33.542 --> 19:36.126
- You know Clancy. Clancy Hibbert.
- Clancy?

19:36.251 --> 19:38.334
Yes. Little small Clancy. Big Clancy now.

19:38.459 --> 19:40.542
No, me know no Clancy. No.

19:41.751 --> 19:44.376
So what happened then, Tappa boy?

19:46.084 --> 19:49.501
Me know you used to work
for that pussyhole, Skeets.

19:52.001 --> 19:55.001
You remember Jerry Dread?

19:55.126 --> 19:57.334
So you're Jerry Dread's little brother?

19:57.459 --> 19:59.876
And now you work for King Fox?

20:03.792 --> 20:06.542
So you know about this, don't you?

20:06.667 --> 20:08.459
Boy, fuck off!

20:18.876 --> 20:20.709
You fuck!

20:28.959 --> 20:32.126
Forget about them things!
Them things are done!

20:33.001 --> 20:36.292
You know what? I can distribute
your white powder business.

20:36.417 --> 20:38.417
But we have to do this thing
professionally.

20:53.917 --> 20:55.501
- Raggz!
- D.!

21:08.376 --> 21:10.334
Rasclaat, D.!

21:12.667 --> 21:15.667
Me tell you for a long time
Clancy Hibbert fired the shot.

21:15.792 --> 21:17.209
You know that, me know that.

21:17.334 --> 21:20.251
Skeets is the one who called the order.
And Skeets is dead.

21:20.376 --> 21:22.751
And Clancy Hibbert, like the rest of them,
gone New York.

21:22.876 --> 21:25.917
And you're still like a mad fucking dog.

21:26.792 --> 21:30.501
And now you mash up my business
with Mr Cheung.

21:30.626 --> 21:34.251
'This wasn't the first time
Fox tell me to forget about Clancy.

21:37.001 --> 21:39.376
'But it might be the last.'

21:41.584 --> 21:43.584
Redemption.

21:46.709 --> 21:50.584
- What's that?
- That? London.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.959
- London?
- London.

21:53.084 --> 21:55.792
- You gonna send me to London?
- London.

21:57.292 --> 21:59.667
Look how much things I do
for the community.

21:59.792 --> 22:01.334
For the people.

22:01.459 --> 22:04.459
For the peace.
For your brother Jerry.

22:05.917 --> 22:11.167
For you,
when nobody wanted Dennis.

22:11.792 --> 22:15.084
And this is how you choose
to pay me back.

22:16.167 --> 22:18.001
Sure thing, boss.

22:18.834 --> 22:20.917
And Dennis...

22:23.876 --> 22:27.792
...this is what I want you
to take with you.

22:27.917 --> 22:31.126
I have a bredren in London,
his name is Rico.

22:31.251 --> 22:33.542
He's expecting you.

22:34.917 --> 22:40.251
Handle that business for me,
when it is done, you let me know.

22:40.376 --> 22:44.001
And when everything's cool back here,
you come home.

22:45.751 --> 22:48.751
Dennis, I can trust you?

22:48.876 --> 22:52.209
Yeah, man, you can trust me. Love.

22:55.126 --> 22:59.417
'Fox was right.
I was like a mad dog.

22:59.542 --> 23:01.876
'I wanted him to trust me again.'

23:08.376 --> 23:11.251
'Welcome to London Gatwick Airport.

23:13.626 --> 23:16.459
'please make your way
through to baggage reclaim.'

23:21.084 --> 23:22.501
Turn it round.

23:29.792 --> 23:34.167
- I suppose you got Bob Marley in here.
- Bob? Who's that?

23:42.584 --> 23:45.001
Welcome to London, Mr Campbell.

Two idiot boys, them.'

Give me that, quick.

24:14.417 --> 24:17.542
Beenie, please don't get us
arrested today.

24:18.959 --> 24:21.376
What's up?
It's always the same, isn't it, Officer?

24:21.501 --> 24:25.751
You see a nice Beamer, must be them
dangerous Yardies from Jamaica, right?

24:25.876 --> 24:29.126
So come on, then, what is it?
"Driving while black" again?

24:29.251 --> 24:32.417
Left-hand brake light isn't working, sir.

24:32.542 --> 24:33.834
Fuck off.

Sticks, Darkers,
look after the car.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.376
No problem, big man.

so sit in the back, yeah?

- Go on, man, let me see it.
- Let me see it. Let me...

- Hey, look.
- Look at that, records.

Careful, careful.
You're going to scratch them. Leave them.

What are you dealing with?

Rico? This is the man that Fox sent
to take care of that piece of business.

You must be Dennis Campbell?

- Yes, sir.

- So what do you think so far?
- It looks good, man. Know what I mean?

27:15.542 --> 27:19.167
Yeah, bloodclaat, I remember
my first time in England.

just licked me down something bad.

27:22.876 --> 27:26.501

Hear what the big man says.

Better than Red Kattz?

28:45.667 --> 28:49.292
No, man, you'll not hear a better sound.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.834

Your brother getting shot down like that
in front of everybody like a mad dog,

is bring that thing into my home?

To get away from Kingston
and Kingston runnings.

is in the kitchen drawer.

37:15.167 --> 37:18.042
'And I knew I had to speak
to King Fox.

37:18.167 --> 37:20.126
'And fast.'

37:54.417 --> 37:56.417
- Yeah?
- Hello?

37:56.542 --> 37:59.584
- Who is it?
- I've got a delivery for you.

38:05.542 --> 38:06.959
Yo, brother!

38:09.167 --> 38:11.167
Where's the flake?
Where's the fucking flake?

38:11.292 --> 38:13.251
- Me got no flake.

38:13.376 --> 38:15.917
Give us the coke!

38:16.042 --> 38:18.792
He thinks we're joking, guys.

38:18.917 --> 38:20.959
- Don't touch nothing!
- Check out the nice ashtray!

38:21.084 --> 38:23.251
No, come on! Come on

38:23.376 --> 38:27.542

38:29.459 --> 38:31.417
Alright, cool now.
Cool, cool. Me get the thing.

38:31.542 --> 38:32.959
Put it down, huh?

38:33.084 --> 38:35.709
We know what you took from Rico,
which makes you a thief.

38:35.834 --> 38:37.626
- Which makes you what?
- Businessmen.

38:37.751 --> 38:40.834
- Which part?
- Listen, you don't know what we know.

38:40.959 --> 38:44.167
You don't know who we know.
So just give us the fucking flake.

38:46.167 --> 38:48.292
Hey, cool, brother.

38:48.417 --> 38:50.667
Alright, big man. Cool.

38:50.792 --> 38:52.876
I'll get the thing,
it's in the kitchen. Come.

38:53.001 --> 38:55.501
- Come, chop-chop now.
- Alright, soldier.

38:55.626 --> 38:57.501
Stupid Jamaican.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.501
Alright, Darkers.

39:01.167 --> 39:04.334

39:07.667 --> 39:09.751
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

39:11.001 --> 39:17.001
You wanna put a gun on me?
You wanna put a gun on me? Hm?

39:17.126 --> 39:19.459
What the fuck?
You think you're a bad man?

39:19.584 --> 39:22.167
Think you're a raasclaat bad man?

39:22.292 --> 39:24.542
I could've killed each one of you dead!

39:24.667 --> 39:27.584
Sit down. Sit down on the fucking floor,
right now!

39:27.709 --> 39:29.834
- What's all this?
- No, no, listen. Please just...

39:29.959 --> 39:33.584
Please?
You want fucking please?

39:43.251 --> 39:45.251
So, who do you work for?

39:45.376 --> 39:48.292
- Is it Rico you work for?
- We don't work for nobody.

39:48.417 --> 39:51.084
- We're self-employed.
- Self-employed?

39:52.959 --> 39:56.417
Well, you'd better unemploy yourself then,
cos Rico's gonna kill you.

39:56.542 --> 39:59.792
No, man. He's going to kill you.
You're the one that thiefed him.

39:59.917 --> 40:04.209
Yo, me see sun?
Take off the darkers, idiot boy!

40:05.751 --> 40:09.001
Stevie Wonder!
Take off the bloodclaat darkers!

40:09.126 --> 40:11.084
So who are you going to sell this to?

40:11.209 --> 40:14.542
- Traders. All those people there.
- What do you mean "traders"?

40:14.667 --> 40:17.376
- Like city traders.
- What do they do?

40:17.501 --> 40:21.584
- I think, I think they kind of sell...
- Yeah, yeah, they sell.

40:21.709 --> 40:23.626
- Yuppies.
- Yuppies. Yuppies, yeah.

40:23.751 --> 40:25.459
Yuppies? What is that?

40:25.584 --> 40:27.792
White men, you know,
they like the white powder.

40:27.917 --> 40:30.876
That kilo of what you got, they love!

40:31.001 --> 40:32.251
For real.

40:32.376 --> 40:37.501
So how are you three little pickney boys
going to sell it forward? Hey?

40:37.626 --> 40:39.459
- We got a buyer.
- Who?

40:39.584 --> 40:42.417
- I'm not telling you my brother's name.
- It's your brother?

40:42.542 --> 40:44.417
- Idiot!
- I never said nothing.

40:44.542 --> 40:47.042
- Look, if you want to meet our contact...
- Him brother, you mean?

40:47.167 --> 40:49.001
Yeah, my... our contact.

40:49.126 --> 40:50.917
Yeah. You're gonna have to pay.

40:51.626 --> 40:56.126
Our cut, well, for a kilo,
is nothing less than £10,000.

40:59.001 --> 41:00.501
Get up, man.

41:00.626 --> 41:04.876
Hey, get your ass up, man.
Listen to what I'm telling you.

41:05.001 --> 41:08.126
You see me again, you're dead.
You understand?

41:08.251 --> 41:09.917
Leave.

41:10.042 --> 41:12.542
Hey, hey, hey, come on,
we need this.

41:14.292 --> 41:16.709
- What do you need it for?
- We're DJs.

41:16.834 --> 41:19.001
We've got a sound clash
coming up soon.

41:19.126 --> 41:22.501
We need a new amp,
new speaker, wires,

41:22.626 --> 41:25.209
and we're up against Red Kattz soon.

41:25.334 --> 41:28.001
You do all of this for Sound?

41:31.542 --> 41:34.042
Where can I find your contact?

41:34.167 --> 41:37.209
This afternoon.
Come to the squat by the canal.

41:37.334 --> 41:39.167
Follow the wires.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.209
See the shades, can I...?

41:45.334 --> 41:49.001
No, you can bring them with you.
No scratches on them, please.

41:50.042 --> 41:53.876
Sorry, I forgot to...
Here you are, this is yours.

41:54.001 --> 41:56.084
Seems like a nice girl.

41:56.209 --> 41:58.334
See you later.

42:03.834 --> 42:06.584
- D.?
- Don't worry yourself, me gone.

42:16.126 --> 42:18.709
Where to? To sell drugs?

42:20.917 --> 42:23.376
- I'm sorting that out.
- How?

42:23.501 --> 42:25.792
- Don't worry yourself.
- How?

42:29.292 --> 42:31.209
You can stay.

42:31.334 --> 42:33.376
But you have to flush the thing.

42:34.042 --> 42:38.126
- Let me see you flush it.
- Me can't flush it, man. You mad?

42:38.251 --> 42:40.334
Me already sold it on.

42:41.834 --> 42:44.209
That bag is worth a lot of money,
you know.

42:44.334 --> 42:46.501
- Me have a baby.
- She's not my baby too?

42:46.626 --> 42:48.584
All your running round
with this foolishness.

42:48.709 --> 42:51.209
Me can't have this nonsense around me.

42:51.334 --> 42:53.084
Around Vanessa.

42:54.876 --> 42:56.876
Package is gone tonight.

42:58.417 --> 43:02.126
Now, you have the key?
Me need to make a quick phone call.

43:02.251 --> 43:04.626
You don't know nobody
from here to call.

43:04.751 --> 43:07.417
And if there is somebody,
use the phone box on the road.

43:07.542 --> 43:10.167
- International call, me need to make one.
- From my yard? Are you mad?

43:10.292 --> 43:11.709
A quick call.

43:11.834 --> 43:14.251
The lock's not big enough for you, D.?

43:15.167 --> 43:17.959
- Come now.
- And your quick is not my quick.

43:24.251 --> 43:27.042
Check for the African man
down the market.

43:27.167 --> 43:31.251
Almost everybody knows
his place is for international calls.

43:33.542 --> 43:35.667
You know, Vanessa's beautiful.

43:37.376 --> 43:39.626
We made a good baby.

43:45.917 --> 43:47.542
Yes, Miss Beckford.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.417
- Yo, sir.
- Alright?

43:50.542 --> 43:53.501
- Where's the canal?
- Down the end and turn right.

43:53.626 --> 43:54.959
Alright.

44:39.167 --> 44:40.584
Basement.

44:42.042 --> 44:43.126
Jesus!

44:44.584 --> 44:47.376
You mashed up the place, huh?

44:47.501 --> 44:49.334
So you found it, then?

44:51.417 --> 44:53.834
Your sound system is called High Noon?

44:54.667 --> 44:56.292
You like the name?

44:56.417 --> 44:58.876
Yeah, man. It's alright.
Sounds righteous.

44:59.001 --> 45:00.792
About the only thing that is.

45:00.917 --> 45:05.709
Right now, the speakers are damp,
box is bust, pre-amp keeps blowing.

45:05.834 --> 45:08.834
Don't worry about those things,
brother. Them things can be fixed.

45:08.959 --> 45:11.876
- So where we going?
- Meet you at my brother's in 15 minutes.

45:16.042 --> 45:18.751
Yeah, that's him.
If anyone can shift a kilo, he can.

45:18.876 --> 45:20.876
Engine's brother.

45:31.917 --> 45:33.334
Come.

45:39.376 --> 45:41.209
Come on, come in.

45:46.042 --> 45:47.667
Jesus!

45:56.459 --> 45:58.417
Come now.

45:58.542 --> 45:59.959
Come on.

46:02.584 --> 46:06.834
These Yardies,
they are bad, bad trouble men.

46:06.959 --> 46:10.459
Last time I heard this Rico Grimes
had a disagreement with somebody,

46:10.584 --> 46:12.626
he took a machete and "zoop"!

46:12.751 --> 46:16.834
He chopped this part off...
Well, you know.

46:16.959 --> 46:21.834
I let Rico do his business in Hackney.
Rico leave Green Lanes alone.

46:21.959 --> 46:25.126
There cannot be a connection to me,
you understand?

46:25.251 --> 46:26.917
Me understand.

46:29.542 --> 46:33.292
Me carried this for a man in JA.
Rico had nothing to do with it.

46:34.251 --> 46:38.376
Right now, me the man who handles it,
and me you have to deal with.

46:38.501 --> 46:40.126
You understand?

46:46.459 --> 46:50.084
Enjoy!
You're not gonna find better than that.

46:50.209 --> 46:53.709
The wicked thing.
The pretty white girl, we call that.

46:53.834 --> 46:57.209
- I like the white girl, man.
- The strongest thing, that's in it.

46:59.251 --> 47:01.209
We'll see.

47:06.876 --> 47:09.042
Think you can sell that?

47:15.626 --> 47:16.709
Masood!

47:23.167 --> 47:24.501
Yeah, boss.

47:24.626 --> 47:28.251
- Where are you calling, Boss?
- Jamaica.

47:28.376 --> 47:30.667
- Number four.
- Number four...

47:30.792 --> 47:33.167
Hey, now, she said the water
is going to break.

47:33.292 --> 47:37.542
And they want me now to remove
the baby out of her. Am I a doctor? No!

47:38.959 --> 47:41.834
- Yes, Rupie, what's happening?
- 'What the bloodclaat's happening?'

47:41.959 --> 47:43.876
- Yeah, man. Everything cool.
- 'What's happening?'

47:44.001 --> 47:46.792
Yeah, everything cool, man.

47:46.917 --> 47:49.917
'No, no, man.
Him gone to Miami for two weeks.

47:50.042 --> 47:53.126
'You were supposed

47:53.251 --> 47:55.334
Rupie, everything's cool, man.

47:55.459 --> 47:57.584
- 'Alright.'
- Yeah, man. Look...

47:58.459 --> 48:02.042
When Fox comes, tell him
to call me on this number, alright?

48:09.834 --> 48:14.584
'It was only a matter of time before
Rico knew the Turks had his cocaine.

48:14.709 --> 48:17.542
'London was already feeling small.'

- Hush up.

You like that?

50:58.542 --> 51:00.876
You like it? You like it?

51:01.001 --> 51:03.042

- Hold on, where are you going?

51:08.542 --> 51:11.626

Yeah, more higher, see.

51:33.376 --> 51:35.084
Rupie, catch the phone there.

51:35.209 --> 51:38.459
Bass, play the pattern
I'm asking you to play.

51:38.584 --> 51:40.626
Hello? D.?

51:40.751 --> 51:43.209
Hey, Rupie, don't bother
giving me the big talk, man.

51:43.334 --> 51:45.626
- Put the boss on the phone. Hurry up.
- 'Alright.

51:45.751 --> 51:47.876
'Boss, D.'s on the phone.'

51:48.001 --> 51:49.709
Go on through!

51:53.584 --> 51:58.459
D... what kind of fuckery is going on
in London, Youth?

51:58.584 --> 52:01.084
Me sorry, Fox. Me tried to call you
for three weeks, man.

52:01.209 --> 52:04.542
'Look, everything's cool, man.
I found a different connection.'

52:04.667 --> 52:07.334
We're going to need more, Boss.
A whole heap more.

52:07.459 --> 52:09.917
We're going to clean up
in England, trust me.

52:10.042 --> 52:12.542
Dennis, me said
to pass the thing to Rico.

52:12.667 --> 52:14.792
Rico too slack, man. Him not ready.

52:14.917 --> 52:18.167
Dennis, me asked you to deliver
the goods to Rico. Me trusted you.

52:18.292 --> 52:21.376
You not hear me say
Rico is a liability?

52:21.501 --> 52:25.084
Him run him mouth how you're a big fish
in a little pond. Me can't take them things.

52:25.209 --> 52:29.709
I sent you to London
so you wouldn't start a war in Kingston.

52:29.834 --> 52:33.917
'Did you go to London to start one?
What the fuck is wrong with you, Youth?'

52:34.042 --> 52:36.709
Listen, and listen to me well.

52:36.834 --> 52:39.834

I used to follow him around clashes
from when I was about eight.

So what happened to your daddy?

01:03:41.126 --> 01:03:43.084
He got stabbed.

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:48.792
So come on, why are you
so interested in this Clancy?

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:53.792
- Don't worry about that.
- There must be a reason, though, right?

01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:59.292

01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:27.917
- Why's his van outside?
- He walks to work.

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:30.626
Nothing up here, D.

01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:36.001
That's my son.

01:09:36.126 --> 01:09:37.459
Please.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:40.459
Come.

01:09:45.376 --> 01:09:47.417
- Nothing?
- Nothing. No.

01:09:47.542 --> 01:09:50.959
Come here. Slowly. Slowly.

01:09:55.209 --> 01:09:57.959
It's alright. It's OK.

01:09:58.084 --> 01:09:59.501
Get off me!

01:10:01.042 --> 01:10:04.376
Hey. Hello. You're alright.

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:07.917
You're alright, darling.
It's OK. It's alright.

01:10:14.626 --> 01:10:16.667
It's OK. It's alright.

01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:20.042
What are you standing there for?

01:10:30.167 --> 01:10:32.876
- Sticks, come.
- But we just got here.

01:10:34.417 --> 01:10:35.834
Beenie.

01:10:35.959 --> 01:10:38.792
- 'Who's that? Mona?'
- Tell Clancy to come home now.

01:10:43.167 --> 01:10:44.917
- 'Still there?'
- Still here.

01:10:45.042 --> 01:10:48.584
- 'I'm gonna drive him over right now.'
- They're still on the estate.

01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:50.542
'Don't worry yourself.
Call Clancy for me!'

01:10:55.792 --> 01:10:57.626
You ready?

01:11:01.001 --> 01:11:03.292
You put the frighteners on her,
I'm telling you.

01:11:03.417 --> 01:11:05.459
Look, don't worry about it, D.
We know where he lives now...

01:11:05.584 --> 01:11:08.001
Yo! Me heard you look for me?

01:11:08.126 --> 01:11:10.292
- Fucking hell, man!
- Move! Move!

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:11.709
Finally!

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:14.209
Now keep away from my baby mother
and pickney, you hear?

01:11:14.334 --> 01:11:16.334
- Me no want trouble.
- You don't want no trouble?

01:11:16.459 --> 01:11:19.417
You have a bloodclaat gun
in your hand, you pussyhole!

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:22.376
- Me just drive a van and fix sound now.
- And kill my brother!

01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:24.751
Ten years ago,
or did you forget about that? Hey?

01:11:24.876 --> 01:11:27.584
You wanna talk about Jerry?
Don't move!

01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:30.167
You come round here disturbing
my woman and scaring my pickney!

01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:32.376
Me have a new life here, man.

01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:35.501
That Jamaica business
was a puppet thing, man!

01:11:35.626 --> 01:11:37.626
You looking for answers,
check your backyard!

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:41.834
All me see is your hand on the trigger.
Why did you kill Jerry?

01:11:41.959 --> 01:11:45.667
No, man. No, no.
Me no like it.

01:11:45.792 --> 01:11:48.376
You're in my face.
Why did you shoot him down like a dog?

01:11:48.501 --> 01:11:50.876
- Jerry had no business...
- Fuck you!

01:11:51.001 --> 01:11:53.292
Why do you bring
your Jamaica business into my life?

01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:58.251
Fuck! I'll kill him! Go on!

01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:04.084
Sticks! No, man! No!

01:12:15.334 --> 01:12:17.584
Sticks, you good?

01:12:20.292 --> 01:12:21.709
Oh, man!

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.876
Oh, no, man!

01:12:29.001 --> 01:12:30.834
Did we get him?

01:12:32.126 --> 01:12:34.501
Did we get him, D.?

01:12:49.167 --> 01:12:51.792
No... You're joking, man.

01:12:51.917 --> 01:12:53.917
You're joking.

01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:19.792
A young man in his prime.

01:13:20.876 --> 01:13:24.084
Gone. Taken.

01:13:27.876 --> 01:13:29.876
I know you're hurting.

01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:34.501
I know because we are hurting too.

01:13:37.834 --> 01:13:40.376
A young death.

01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:42.626
A senseless death.

01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:46.667
An unnecessary death.

01:13:48.292 --> 01:13:51.126
One that only causes more pain
to a family.

01:13:51.251 --> 01:13:55.251
'I know that you grieve
at this difficult time.'

01:13:57.959 --> 01:14:00.209
It's not supposed to be like this.

01:14:01.292 --> 01:14:05.542
'No mother is supposed
to bury their child!'

01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:09.292
Our children are supposed to bury us.

01:14:11.417 --> 01:14:16.042
'Ask yourself a question,
all of you. Why?'

01:14:16.167 --> 01:14:18.167
Hm? Why?

01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:23.542
D.!

01:14:38.376 --> 01:14:40.209
Get in here.

01:15:08.001 --> 01:15:10.001
Me lost my way, you know.

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:15.126
I have get back on the righteous path.

01:15:16.501 --> 01:15:20.917
You're talking in riddles, D.
What path?

01:15:24.001 --> 01:15:25.626
Clancy Hibbert.

01:15:27.667 --> 01:15:29.667
Me have to kill him.

01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:36.959
- Sticks is dead. Jerry is dead...
- Listen to me, D.

01:15:37.626 --> 01:15:40.459
You're not going to kill Clancy.

01:15:40.584 --> 01:15:44.167
Killing Clancy is not gonna
solve nothing.

01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:46.751
This thing with Clancy Hibbert,
it has to end, you hear me?

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:49.292
- You don't understand.
- Of course, me understand!

01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:54.917
Jerry Dread died ten years ago, D.
You can't go on like this.

01:15:59.709 --> 01:16:01.334
Me see him, you know.

01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:04.917
Me see him.

01:16:06.584 --> 01:16:09.126
Me see Jerry.

01:16:09.251 --> 01:16:11.334
Him talk to me.

01:16:11.459 --> 01:16:13.542
Him see me.

01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:16.834
Him see the real me.

01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:20.209
You're scaring me now, D.

01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:28.126
- A duppy?
- A duppy, yes.

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:31.459
A ghost. Know why?

01:16:33.167 --> 01:16:36.167
Cos me never give him
a good send off!

01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:44.376
- Me never give him a good send off.
- D., what are you talking about?

01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:46.501
Nine Night.

01:16:48.084 --> 01:16:50.292
Me dash all the things around.

01:16:50.417 --> 01:16:52.876
And now he's a restless spirit
running round.

01:16:53.001 --> 01:16:57.292
You believe all them granny foolishness?
All them superstitions are nonsense!

01:16:57.417 --> 01:17:00.167
That's why you mash up my house, D.?

01:17:00.292 --> 01:17:01.917
Jerry loved you.

01:17:02.042 --> 01:17:05.584
Why would he want to come back
and cause mischief?

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:11.751
Christian girl.

01:17:13.584 --> 01:17:15.584
This thing not stop...

01:17:16.959 --> 01:17:19.959
...until Clancy dead. You hear?

01:17:22.626 --> 01:17:25.417
Until Clancy dead.

01:18:04.542 --> 01:18:07.709
- You're Mona, right?
- Do I know you from somewhere?

01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:11.001
- Yes.
- That's Vanessa's mummy.

01:18:11.126 --> 01:18:13.459
We have pickney in the same nursery.

01:18:13.584 --> 01:18:15.792
- Vanessa's your daughter?
- Yes, but...

01:18:15.917 --> 01:18:17.584
You're D.'s baby mother?

01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:20.459
D. who nearly killed me,
who nearly killed Clancy?

01:18:20.584 --> 01:18:23.126
You have some raasclaat nerve
coming round here.

01:18:23.251 --> 01:18:24.501
Go away!

01:18:24.626 --> 01:18:26.292
Clancy Hibbert!

01:18:27.626 --> 01:18:29.292
You know her?

01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:32.376
Clancy, we need to talk.

01:18:38.417 --> 01:18:40.584
Yvonne is not here, Miss Hammond.

01:18:40.709 --> 01:18:42.709
Me no come for Yvonne.

01:18:43.459 --> 01:18:45.459
It's you me come for.

01:18:49.876 --> 01:18:54.084
This. Me coming here.
I want you to know it was my decision.

01:18:54.209 --> 01:18:56.959
- Nothing to do with D.
- OK.

01:18:59.292 --> 01:19:00.959
Mona...

01:19:03.876 --> 01:19:05.959
Really and truly,
me just a gangster, you know?

01:19:06.084 --> 01:19:09.501
Really and truly you are broken,
and you broke Yvonne's heart, D.

01:19:11.417 --> 01:19:14.584
And you step into Vanessa's life,
and be gone again.

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:16.751
Dead or in jail?

01:19:16.876 --> 01:19:19.334
We are parents.

01:19:19.459 --> 01:19:20.959
What are we supposed
to tell our children

01:19:21.084 --> 01:19:23.876
when them grow up
and don't know them father?

01:19:24.001 --> 01:19:27.584
This killing for something that happened
in the past, this have to stop, man.

01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:29.792
Dennis come to my yard.

01:19:29.917 --> 01:19:33.376
Me never go to his.
Me never threatened his family.

01:19:34.834 --> 01:19:37.501
Me don't wanna kill D., you know.

01:19:38.584 --> 01:19:40.876
And me never wanted to kill Jerry.

01:19:41.626 --> 01:19:44.917
You were just 13 years old
when you witnessed Jerry's death

01:19:45.042 --> 01:19:47.126
and it never left you.

01:19:48.167 --> 01:19:52.459
Boy, you have suffered
from the grief and trauma.

01:19:52.584 --> 01:19:54.209
Look at yourself.

01:19:55.251 --> 01:19:57.209
Me was just a little youth.

01:19:57.334 --> 01:20:01.251
A little youth, and me shot a big man.
And me pay for it all my life.

01:20:01.376 --> 01:20:03.334
I know it hurts. I know.

01:20:03.459 --> 01:20:06.251
But you never did nothing wrong
on Nine Night.

01:20:06.376 --> 01:20:08.584
And me know tradition.
You listen me?

01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:12.626
You don't know what it's like
to have a dream of killing a man,

01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:15.084
shooting a man.

01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:18.126
Ten years me see the same thing!

01:20:19.084 --> 01:20:22.751
You want to hold on to Jerry.

01:20:22.876 --> 01:20:26.417
But it's time to let him go.

01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:30.334
One man knows the truth.

01:20:31.834 --> 01:20:35.501
It's nothing to do with me, you know.
King Fox knows that.

01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:46.501
Rise.
Choose the right path, son.

01:20:51.417 --> 01:20:54.209
'Don't forget the big
sound clash tonight at Rico's.

01:20:54.334 --> 01:20:56.792
'High Noon vs Red Kattz.

01:20:56.917 --> 01:21:00.042
- 'Gonna be big! Big, big, big!'
- Raise up the treble!

01:21:00.167 --> 01:21:03.917
Bass, come on.
Come here, man. Come on.

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:09.376
Bass, bass, you hear that?
Come on, man.

01:21:09.501 --> 01:21:11.334
Rico...

01:21:14.834 --> 01:21:16.751
Yes, my bredren!

01:21:18.042 --> 01:21:20.959
What take you so long, huh?

01:21:21.084 --> 01:21:23.209
Come upon the boat?

01:21:27.917 --> 01:21:30.126
Come, let me fix you a drink.

01:21:38.167 --> 01:21:39.584
Hello?

01:21:41.501 --> 01:21:43.001
'Hello?'

01:21:44.167 --> 01:21:47.751
Yvonne. This is King Fox.

01:21:51.001 --> 01:21:52.876
I have a message for D.

01:21:53.751 --> 01:21:58.501
Tell him that I'm looking forward
to seeing him at the sound clash tonight,

01:21:58.626 --> 01:22:01.667
and to deal with some
unfinished business.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:07.626
Oh, by the way,
tell him no more war in the ghetto.

01:22:11.334 --> 01:22:12.542
Yeah.

01:22:14.834 --> 01:22:16.792
Who called?

01:22:16.917 --> 01:22:20.376
King Fox.
Him wanna talk to you.

01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:24.792
- Me go call him back.
- He's here, D.

01:22:26.292 --> 01:22:28.417
Me just come from Clancy's yard.

01:22:28.542 --> 01:22:33.376
And Clancy told me it's King Fox
you need to talk to about the Jerry killing.

01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:35.334
You see Clancy?

01:22:37.417 --> 01:22:41.751
- D., Clancy said don't come tonight.
- King Fox is like a father to me.

01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:45.126
Why raasclaat should I listen
to anything Clancy have to say?

01:22:46.334 --> 01:22:48.501
Don't go to the sound clash.

01:22:49.667 --> 01:22:52.251
Me no feel good about it.

01:22:52.376 --> 01:22:53.792

'For Sticks.

01:23:01.751 --> 01:23:03.792
'For the boys.'

01:23:04.876 --> 01:23:07.626
Well, me going with you?

01:23:09.167 --> 01:23:12.542

Him bad for Spicer business.

01:23:57.042 --> 01:24:00.126
What the fuck you talk
about Spicer business?

01:24:00.251 --> 01:24:03.626
What you know
about Spicer business, eh?

01:24:04.417 --> 01:24:08.084

This here is London Town.
Not Trenchtown.

01:24:11.167 --> 01:24:14.167
Dennis cost me a lot of money, right?

Money I'm going to take from your cut.
You understand?
