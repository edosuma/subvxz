-* Whatcha gonna do *

00:23.633 --> 00:26.500

00:26.533 --> 00:28.100
-Crawl out!

00:32.733 --> 00:34.333
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.367 --> 00:36.600
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.633 --> 00:39.167
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.200 --> 00:40.800
in a court of law.

00:43.167 --> 00:47.333
-I've been out here in Lehigh
for almost two years now.

00:47.367 --> 00:49.567
I'm on the East District
SET Team.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.333
I'm a huge fan of going
after warrants,

00:52.367 --> 00:55.400
you know, the investigative
background of where
these people live.

00:55.433 --> 00:58.900
I find that very satisfying
when you're able to, you know,

00:58.933 --> 01:00.567
work that all the way through.

01:01.767 --> 01:04.400
Okay, so we received
some information that a person

01:04.433 --> 01:07.933
that we're looking for,
a wanted subject who has
several felony warrants out,

01:07.967 --> 01:10.233
is in the area.
We're here with several

01:10.267 --> 01:12.833
other deputies.
Um, we're gonna see
what's goin' on.

01:12.867 --> 01:15.833
-(radio chatter)

01:15.867 --> 01:18.500
-Woman:
He came to my house
without anything.

01:18.533 --> 01:20.500
-Where's he at?

01:20.533 --> 01:22.800
Right here, right here,
right here!

01:22.833 --> 01:24.867
-(sirens blaring)

01:24.900 --> 01:25.900
-I see him, I see him!

01:25.933 --> 01:28.367
Hey, right there,
he just cut right!

01:28.400 --> 01:32.100
-(sirens continue)
-Go back!

01:32.133 --> 01:33.433
I saw him run through this yard!

01:33.467 --> 01:36.367
-(radio chatter)

01:38.333 --> 01:40.067
-Crossed the canal?

01:44.800 --> 01:47.567
Hey, give us an updated location
of where you're at.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.800
Where'd he run?
(breathing heavily)

01:50.833 --> 01:51.967
SET 5 to K-9.

01:52.067 --> 01:53.433
Hey, Birch, right here!

01:53.467 --> 01:54.533
-(radio chatter)

01:54.567 --> 01:57.500
-Get in the house, sir!
-Stand by, county.

01:57.533 --> 02:00.467
Okay, so, suspect
took off on foot.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.233
We got several deputies
in pursuit, on foot,

02:03.267 --> 02:05.800
we're tryin' to just locate
where they're at right now.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.633
County, we're, uh, off of Davis.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.767
We got K-9 on the ground,
we're about to track--

02:09.800 --> 02:13.533
(breathing heavily)
-Dispatcher: Next unit,
take Coolidge and Oregon.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.733
Next unit, go
to Jefferson and Oregon.

02:15.767 --> 02:18.467
-He went down here!
-Go to your left!

02:18.500 --> 02:19.733
-Right here?
-Yes, sir.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.067
-Okay.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.067
-(radio chatter)
-Mark this thing right here.

02:23.067 --> 02:25.867
-Okay.
-(radio chatter)

02:25.900 --> 02:27.667
-County, K-9's
on Stewart Lane.

02:27.700 --> 02:30.067
Bein' advised he ran
through the backyard here.

02:30.100 --> 02:34.133
All right, so we have witnesses
pointing us, telling us
direction of travel.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.833
Uh, we're here with K-9.

02:35.867 --> 02:37.700
-(radio chatter)
-Uh, Deputy Benora,

02:37.733 --> 02:40.067
and his K-9 partner, Eli.

02:40.067 --> 02:42.400
See if we can get
a good solid track
that we can follow.

02:42.433 --> 02:46.067
-(radio chatter)
-Yes! Tall, long hair!

02:46.067 --> 02:47.767
I hear yelling
inside this house!

02:47.800 --> 02:50.067
The one behind the residence
at Stewart Lane.

02:53.267 --> 02:55.767
-Man on radio: Thank you,
please control the perimeter
for me, please?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.733
-I'll check it.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.267
-Man 2 on radio:
Ten-four.

03:00.633 --> 03:04.567
-(radio chatter)
-Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

03:04.600 --> 03:07.333
-Hands up! Hands up! Hands up!

03:07.367 --> 03:08.667
-Get outta the trash can!

03:08.700 --> 03:09.933
Crawl out!

03:09.967 --> 03:11.167
-Get your dog!
-Crawl out!

03:11.200 --> 03:12.267
-Get your dog! I'm out!

03:12.300 --> 03:14.067
-I'm out, I'm out!
-Stay on the ground!

03:14.100 --> 03:16.500
-I'm out, I'm out!
(screaming)

03:16.533 --> 03:19.367
-Turn over!
Roll over on your stomach!
Get on the ground!

03:19.400 --> 03:20.900
Put your hands out
to your side!

03:20.933 --> 03:22.467
Put your hands out
to your side!
-Ow! My arm!

03:22.500 --> 03:24.067
-Stop movin'! Don't move!

03:24.100 --> 03:25.733
You understand?

03:25.767 --> 03:26.867
-You (bleep) my arm.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.067
-Put your hands together, man.

03:28.067 --> 03:30.367
-My arm, I-- I can't move it!
-Relax, relax!

03:32.067 --> 03:33.300
Why were you
in the trash can, bro?

03:33.333 --> 03:35.400
-What do you think?
Dude, my arm's broken.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.333
-I'll get the EMS for you here.
-No, man.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.200
-Get up!
-Let go of my (bleep).

03:39.233 --> 03:40.800
-Get up, now!
Let's go!

03:40.833 --> 03:43.533
-Dude, my arm.
-We're gonna take care of it,
we're gonna call EMS.

03:43.567 --> 03:45.467
-It's broken.
-Why were you runnin'?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.133
-Why were you running, man?
-You guys were tryin'

03:47.167 --> 03:48.467
to get me on some (bleep)
I didn't do.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.767
-Tony, can we get EMS
to our location?
-My arm.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.867
My arm!
-Reference a dog bite
on the arm.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.533
-More than that.
-(radio chatter)

03:56.967 --> 03:59.600
-Ten-four. One outstanding,
we got him, 10-12.

03:59.633 --> 04:01.467
-Get in the car.
-Owwww!

04:01.500 --> 04:04.200
I can't-- Can I lean back?

04:04.233 --> 04:06.600
My arm, bro!
-I understand that.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.500
All right, so right now
we found him in the garbage can,

04:10.533 --> 04:11.767
we're just gonna
do an article search.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.667
He's known
to have firearms
and stuff like that,

04:13.700 --> 04:15.767
so we're just gonna
check it out, make sure
there's nothin' left

04:15.800 --> 04:17.067
in the grass
for anyone to find.

04:17.067 --> 04:19.967
Huh? Okay.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.567
What is it?
-A pill bottle with--

04:21.600 --> 04:23.167
-Dope in it? That's weed?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.567
All right, so right here
is this little pill bottle,

04:25.600 --> 04:27.500
or gold bottle--
-Sittin' right there
on top of it.

04:27.533 --> 04:31.667
-All right.
-This is right
where we found him.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.567
Um, we'll search that.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.067
We got some weed in there.

04:36.067 --> 04:40.167
You can see the baggie,
there's some inside the bag
and there's actually

04:40.200 --> 04:42.367
some content
in the pill bottle.

04:42.400 --> 04:47.567
Also, we have this lighter,
his wallet... pretty sure.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.233
Picture of his girlfriend.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.700
Hey, Alec, can you talk to me
for a second?

04:52.733 --> 04:53.867
-I'm listenin', yeah.
-Okay.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.933
Do you wanna tell me
about what happened tonight?

04:55.967 --> 04:58.533
You wanna tell me
why you were running,
why were you hiding?

04:58.567 --> 05:01.067
-Because I have
a (bleep) life to live, man,

05:01.067 --> 05:02.667
and I'm not tryin'
to sit in jail.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.233
So I (bleep) ran.

05:04.267 --> 05:06.167
-All right. All right.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.800
What-- What did
you think was gonna happen
if you got caught, man?

05:08.833 --> 05:11.267
-I was gonna (bleep)
sit in jail because I'm
on diversion,

05:11.300 --> 05:13.300
and I thought you guys
were gonna hold me
for 90 (bleep) days.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.867
-And my birthday's March 22nd,
I'm turnin' 21,
-I know.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.300
-you only turn 21
once in your life.

05:17.333 --> 05:18.967
-I know, man.
-That's why. That's why
I was runnin'.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.767
-Okay. All right.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.933
Do you think
it was a good idea?

05:22.967 --> 05:26.167
Do you think you probably
would've got in a little bit
less trouble if you just

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
stood in the middle
of the road and said,
"Guys, I give up,

05:28.233 --> 05:30.500
you know?
It is what it is.
Take me for what you got."

05:30.533 --> 05:32.567
-I'm not a quitter, officer.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.867
-All right, man,
I understand.
-Clearly.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.933
-All right.
What is this?

05:35.967 --> 05:39.600
-That is my personal stash
of marijuana.
-Okay. All right.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.367
It's not legal yet, man.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.400
-Close enough.
-It's gettin' there.
It's get-- "Close enough"?

05:45.433 --> 05:46.933
No, it doesn't work
like that, man.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.667
-Can I see what you got
in my wallet?

05:48.700 --> 05:50.500
-Yeah. Here's what I got.
-And he took all the fifties.

05:50.533 --> 05:52.367
-Who took 'em?
-I could point you out
to him in a lineup.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.200
-There's three ones in there.
-That's fine.

05:54.233 --> 05:57.467
-There's another twenty
still in there.
-That's fine.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.733
-That girl--
The picture in there,
that's your girlfriend, right?

05:59.767 --> 06:02.233
-She beautiful, ain't she?
-Yeah, she is. I talked
to her earlier tonight.

06:02.267 --> 06:08.900
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

06:08.933 --> 06:12.433
nine, 10, 11, 12.

06:12.467 --> 06:14.733
-I been savin' that
(bleep) for two goddamn months.

06:14.767 --> 06:16.767
-Okay, so you see we didn't
take your money, man,
all right?

06:16.800 --> 06:19.300
-Right. What are we doin'?
Can I get my arm
handled up?

06:19.333 --> 06:22.367
-Yeah. Let me pull you out,
we'll fix your cuffs real quick.
-(bleep) hurts, man.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.067
-I understand, man.
Okay, here's what you're
gettin' charged with, Alec.

06:25.067 --> 06:29.300
You're gonna get charged
with a warrant that we have
already, for you resisting us,

06:29.333 --> 06:32.300
running the other day.
You're gonna get charged
for an additional warrant

06:32.333 --> 06:35.467
that came out,
was a failure to appear
for something.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.233
And you're also
gonna get charged--
-For the traffic?

06:37.267 --> 06:40.333
-Yeah. Then you're also
gonna get charged again today
for running from us today.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.433
-That's all?
-Yes, sir.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.767
-I'm gonna fix your cuffs, okay?
-Slowly.

06:46.233 --> 06:49.167
-In Grand Prairie, we--
we like to be responsibly
aggressive and with that,

06:49.200 --> 06:51.267
I mean, traffic stops
are the key to everything.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.500
You know, as an entire shift,
we really try to be aggressive

06:53.533 --> 06:55.233
on-- on traffic stops.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.533
You know, they lead into--
to bigger arrests.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.067
Um, and that's how
you find narcotics,

06:59.067 --> 07:00.600
that's how you find guns.

07:00.633 --> 07:02.900
Um, that's how you get
the-- the people that are wanted

07:02.933 --> 07:04.633
off the street.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.900
All right, so we just
ran a tag on this
black Suburban

07:06.933 --> 07:08.567
It shown it had
an unconfirmed insurance,

07:08.600 --> 07:10.367
meaning the insurance
on the vehicle is out.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.767
We're gonna conduct
a traffic stop on the vehicle.

07:16.133 --> 07:18.133
-(radio chatter)

07:19.767 --> 07:21.433
-How you doin' today, sir?
-What's up?

07:21.467 --> 07:23.800
-Do you have your driver's
license and proof of insurance
for your vehicle?

07:23.833 --> 07:25.233
-Can I ask
what I'm being stopped for?

07:25.267 --> 07:28.067
-Yes, your insurance
is shown to be ineligible
on your status.

07:28.067 --> 07:30.167
-Ineligible?
-Yeah, meaning you have
no insurance.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.567
-(indistinct woman's voice)
-Oh, that's my girlfriend.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.067
-Okay.
-Um-mm.

07:34.067 --> 07:37.300
-Woman: A traffic stop.
-Yeah, you need to go back
to your car.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.533
-I think I left my ID
in the house.

07:38.567 --> 07:41.333
-23-77,
I have a second vehicle
that pulled over

07:41.367 --> 07:43.367
and is yellin' at us.
-That's my girlfriend.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.067
-Okay, is there anything
illegal in this vehicle?

07:45.067 --> 07:47.133
-No, sir.
-Okay, is there a reason
that she'd be up on us all mad

07:47.167 --> 07:49.467
that you're gettin' pulled over?
-Oh, she probably wanna
know why.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.233
Hey, calm down!

07:51.267 --> 07:53.700
-All right, man.
What I'm gonna have you do
is just hang out here a minute.

07:53.733 --> 07:55.933
I see you have, like,
shake residue from marijuana
in your lap, man.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.833
Is there any marijuana
in the car? Listen,
dude, marijuana

07:57.867 --> 08:00.567
can be a citation
if you're honest with me.
I don't care about it, man.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.867
If you got a little bit of bud,
I can write you a ticket for it

08:02.900 --> 08:05.667
and let you go home.
If you lie to me and I find it,

08:05.700 --> 08:08.067
I don't care how much it is,
I'll take you to jail on it.

08:08.067 --> 08:10.600
-I got a little stash.
-Okay, what is it?
Like a-- a gram?

08:10.633 --> 08:14.067
-It's like a blunt.
-Okay. Go ahead and take it out
and hand it to me.

08:16.967 --> 08:19.100
Okay. Just that, right?
-Yeah.

08:19.133 --> 08:22.300
-Okay. All right, man.
What I'm gonna have you do,
is, uh-- I just gotta make sure

08:22.333 --> 08:24.233
there's no other marijuana
in the vehicle, okay?

08:24.267 --> 08:26.933
If that's all the marijuana
you got, I'll write you
a citation for it, okay?

08:26.967 --> 08:28.467
So I'm gonna have you
step out of the vehicle,

08:28.500 --> 08:29.667
keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

08:29.700 --> 08:30.733
You have any weapons on you?

08:30.767 --> 08:32.300
Knife, needle--
Don't reach for anything.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.267
-No, I ain't got
no weapons on me.
-Okay, you don't have a knife,

08:34.300 --> 08:36.167
needle, gun, nothin' like that,
right? On you.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.700
Okay. Keep your hands
where I can see 'em,
step out of the vehicle,

08:38.733 --> 08:39.900
you understand?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.667
Turn and face the vehicle.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.467
Hands on top
of your head.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.633
And then, for your safety
and my safety, I'm gonna
place you in handcuffs, okay?

08:49.667 --> 08:52.800
You're not under arrest
at this time, just simply
gonna be placed in handcuffs.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.967
That way, you're safe
and I'm safe, cool?

08:55.067 --> 08:57.567
-Yeah, I got it.
-Especially with her
runnin' up on me like that,

08:57.600 --> 09:01.067
and how you looked, like,
you looked really concerned
about when I asked you

09:01.100 --> 09:02.867
if there was a gun
in this car.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.667
Is there a gun in the car?

09:04.700 --> 09:07.867
-Yeah, there's a gun.
-Okay. Is it stolen
or is it yours?

09:07.900 --> 09:09.500
-No, it ain't no stolen gun.
-Okay.

09:09.533 --> 09:10.833
Where is it at?

09:10.867 --> 09:13.233
-It's under my seat.
-Under your seat? Okay.

09:13.267 --> 09:15.067
-I mean I only got that
'cause I got shot

09:15.067 --> 09:16.600
a couple years ago, man.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.467
-Is there anything else
in this car I need
to know about?

09:18.500 --> 09:19.967
-I go to school,
go to school,
I go to school.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.300
-Where at?
-Mountain View College.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.800
-Okay.
-I go to school
after work.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.867
-You're gonna come back
over here, and you're gonna
sit down.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.700
-I'll sit you
in the grass, okay?
-All right.

09:28.733 --> 09:30.800
-Sit down.
-Woman: What's going on?

09:30.833 --> 09:33.067
-Man, what?
Baby, what you doin'?

09:33.067 --> 09:35.467
-A second vehicle
behind us pulled up,
and started yellin' at me,

09:35.500 --> 09:36.933
while we were conducting
this traffic stop,

09:36.967 --> 09:39.467
so additional officers
are investigating with her.

09:47.533 --> 09:52.733
Springfield XD, fully loaded,
round in the chamber,
two twenty-three,

09:52.767 --> 09:54.433
copy at gun for stolen?

09:54.467 --> 09:57.833
-You shouldn't have a gun.
You can't have a gun and also
have marijuana.

09:57.867 --> 10:00.300
Did you buy it at a store
or did you buy it off somebody?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.100
-I bought it
off the street, but...

10:02.133 --> 10:04.000
-How do you know
it's not stolen?

10:04.033 --> 10:07.867
-I mean, I looked at the law.
They said that don't
really matter, do it?

10:07.900 --> 10:10.967
-Right, you can buy a gun
from somebody else.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.433
But if you didn't buy it
from a store-- you told us
it wasn't stolen,

10:14.467 --> 10:16.933
and you just bought it,
but how do you know--
-Hey, that's what I'm sayin'.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.967
-But how do you know
it's not stolen?
-Well, I ain't steal it.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
-How do you know somebody
didn't steal it and...
sell it to you?

10:22.033 --> 10:23.900
And now you're gonna
be caught with it?
-Well, they said--

10:23.933 --> 10:26.367
Well, I don't know. The person
I bought it from, he said
he ain't steal it,

10:26.400 --> 10:27.600
you know what I'm sayin'?

10:27.633 --> 10:29.133
-You don't know the person
you bought it from?

10:29.167 --> 10:30.533
-He had a case--
-Second gun.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.933
Second gun.
You're under arrest.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.033
Unlawful carry
of a weapon, you have
two guns in there,

10:36.067 --> 10:40.800
pills, other narcotics.
We're gonna get you
wrapped up there, bud.

10:40.833 --> 10:44.533
-That ain't mine, though.
Why y'all gotta put that on me?

10:44.567 --> 10:46.367
-Stand there.
Spread your feet.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.267
There you go.
How much cash you got on you?

10:48.300 --> 10:50.767
-Man, that's the (indistinct).
-I didn't ask that.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.767
Just how much.
I gotta document it.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.333
-Probably a lot. I don't know.
-A lot.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.500
-That's not mine.
-How long you been
slingin' dope?

10:58.533 --> 11:01.167
-That's a school check, D.
-A school check, huh?

11:01.200 --> 11:05.267
-I don't sling dope.
-What's all the-- What are
the narcotics that are in there?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.067
You don't know?
-That ain't my bag.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.733
-It's in the backpack?
Not your backpack?

11:08.767 --> 11:10.300
-See, that's what I'm sayin'.
He just asked me.

11:10.333 --> 11:13.167
Those people in the cowboy boots
were messing with my car, man.

11:16.233 --> 11:17.767
-Does she have any weapons
in the vehicle?

11:17.800 --> 11:19.267
-She's got a pistol magazine.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.400
-Okay.

11:20.433 --> 11:22.333
-Um, I'm not sure
what kinda pistol it was,

11:22.367 --> 11:24.667
but there was
a loaded magazine.
-Is that a 9mm-- I have

11:24.700 --> 11:28.533
two different pistols.
-Uh, it's either a nine
or a 380, I think it's a nine.

11:28.567 --> 11:29.933
I haven't looked that close,
but then, uh,

11:29.967 --> 11:32.067
this was right here
on the back seat.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.067
At one of our robberies
last week,

11:34.067 --> 11:35.800
-Yep.
-Didn't they wear a mask
like that?

11:35.833 --> 11:38.267
-Mask. And the way she's actin',
that she just stopped behind me,

11:38.300 --> 11:40.800
and she came runnin' up
on us and started yellin'
"Why are you stoppin' him?"

11:40.833 --> 11:42.567
-She-- She ran up on me
when I pulled up, too,

11:42.600 --> 11:43.833
she hopped out of the car, and--

11:43.867 --> 11:46.433
-She's clearly
the distractionary method
for him.

11:46.467 --> 11:49.067
-She just kept sayin'
"You stopped him for no reason,
and I was behind him,

11:49.067 --> 11:50.600
so I know he didn't
do nothin' wrong."

11:50.633 --> 11:54.133
-Yeah.
-And she doesn't smoke dope,
but she was sittin' on that.

11:54.167 --> 11:55.933
-Huh. Ice.

11:57.767 --> 12:00.733
Probable cause search
of the vehicle, came across
this backpack.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.967
Had another gun in it,
and it looks like it has
some homemade pills.

12:03.067 --> 12:05.067
That's some kinda
homemade narcotic.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.367
Probably gonna
be crack cocaine, man.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.567
-Yeah.

12:09.367 --> 12:12.467
-And look at that,
another magazine for the gun
that was underneath his seat.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.900
All this is connecting him
to selling of-- of narcotics.

12:16.933 --> 12:19.067
This is the female
that pulled up behind me
at the traffic stop

12:19.067 --> 12:20.533
and started yelling at me.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.300
All right, ma'am,
why'd you pull up
behind me

12:22.333 --> 12:24.900
and start yellin'?
-Because they pullin'
my boyfriend over

12:24.933 --> 12:28.067
for no (bleep) reason.
-Okay. So what does that
give you the right

12:28.067 --> 12:29.667
to hop out
and start yellin' at us?

12:29.700 --> 12:32.800
-Yeah, because I don't
like cops! Cops always
killin' black people!

12:32.833 --> 12:34.600
-Okay.
-You're always killin' us.

12:34.633 --> 12:37.067
-All right.
-And he is a black man
that got pulled over

12:37.067 --> 12:39.467
for no (bleep) reason.
-Obviously, he's
a drug dealer.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.100
-He's not no drug dealer!
-That's why you hopped out
to yell at us.

12:42.133 --> 12:43.700
-He's not no drug dealer.
-Yeah.

12:43.733 --> 12:46.333
-He's not no drug dealer.
He's a college student
that's on the A--

12:46.367 --> 12:49.200
nope, he's a college student
that's on the Dean's list,

12:49.233 --> 12:50.667
that goes
to Mountain View College.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.067
-Just carryin' guns,
weed, and crack cocaine,
too, huh?

12:53.067 --> 12:54.800
-Crack cocaine?
-Yeah. Okay.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.067
-He ain't carryin'
none of that (bleep).

12:57.100 --> 12:59.567
-She goin' to jail
for possession of marijuana.
He's goin' to jail

12:59.600 --> 13:01.367
for possession
of a controlled substance.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.500
It's kind of a first,
having the second subject
pull up on me,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.700
and basically give us
a reason to arrest her.

13:06.933 --> 13:08.767
So we got a return
on our subject
we just arrested,

13:08.800 --> 13:12.700
and he's shown
to be wanted out of, uh,
Fort Worth for robbery.

13:12.733 --> 13:15.867
And that-- that links
to our two guns found
in the vehicle,

13:15.900 --> 13:18.433
as well as the--
the mask found
in the vehicle behind us.

13:18.467 --> 13:20.333
And he's considered
armed and dangerous.

13:23.233 --> 13:25.067
-I remember when I was a kid,

13:25.100 --> 13:27.067
my grandfather used to tell me
all these great stories

13:27.067 --> 13:30.067
about the things he did
as a New York City
police officer.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.567
And in an added extra,
I was named after him.

13:32.600 --> 13:36.167
So when I had the opportunity
to go into law enforcement,

13:36.200 --> 13:38.567
I took that opportunity,
went to the academy,

13:38.600 --> 13:42.367
and, uh, and I came here
to Pasco, and been lovin' it
ever since.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.633
So we're gettin' dispatched out
to a call.

13:45.667 --> 13:48.433
It's comin' out
as a domestic battery
in progress.

13:48.467 --> 13:53.133
Uh, it appears that a young man
and his mom's boyfriend

13:53.167 --> 13:56.333
were involved in an altercation
which turned physical.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.733
We have a report
that one of them is injured.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.900
Uh, so we're gonna see
what's goin' on.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.667
-What's goin' on, buddy?

14:07.700 --> 14:10.133
-So, I get home from work...

14:10.167 --> 14:11.567
-Rick, you wanna come over?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.933
-...Rick and my mom
are arguing, right? As usual.

14:14.967 --> 14:17.633
-Who's Rick to you?
-Rick, the guy that attacked me.

14:17.667 --> 14:21.067
-Okay. Who's he to you?
-Nothing, just Mom's boyfriend.

14:21.067 --> 14:22.533
-Mom's boyfriend.
-Yep.

14:22.567 --> 14:25.633
-Just stay over there
right now, sir, I'll be there
in a minute.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.867
-All right, so I get home...
he likes to think that,

14:27.900 --> 14:31.233
you know, I'm 21,
I'm still living with my mom.
He has a problem with that.

14:31.267 --> 14:34.567
He's like, "Oh, mama this,
suck on her titty, get off
her titty, blah blah blah."

14:34.600 --> 14:37.367
I'm like, "Dude." Anyway,
so I'm like, "What is so wrong

14:37.400 --> 14:39.667
with a mother
and son relationship?"

14:39.700 --> 14:42.400
And he's like,
"Get your (bleep) ass--"
I'm like, "All right, dude,

14:42.433 --> 14:44.567
I know, I see you're
a little drunk." He's like,
"I'm not drunk,"

14:44.600 --> 14:48.633
gets up out of his chair,
grabs me-- grabs me--

14:48.667 --> 14:51.333
-Step back a little.
Let me look.
-Grabs me...

14:53.067 --> 14:55.567
-Okay.
-...punches me right here.
It's not that red,

14:55.600 --> 14:59.333
I kinda-- I saw it comin'.
And I just push him off.
He turns around,

14:59.367 --> 15:02.933
falls like this on his face.
He's got a little blood
right here.

15:02.967 --> 15:05.700
And now I'm like,
"Dude, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking?"

15:05.733 --> 15:09.733
Like, "What are you doin' man?"
Like, "This hasn't-- like, that
should not have happened

15:09.767 --> 15:11.833
just now."
-Okay. Do you have ID on you
by any chance?

15:11.867 --> 15:13.933
-I can go get it.
-Yeah. If you do that,
can you have your mom

15:13.967 --> 15:15.767
step out for me,
so I can talk to her?
-Yes.

15:19.533 --> 15:21.100
-How you doin'?
Can I talk to you for a minute?

15:21.133 --> 15:23.933
-Sure.
-Can, uh, can we step over here
real quick?

15:23.967 --> 15:25.467
-Sure.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.533
-You wanna just have a seat
right there, sir?
I'll be right back.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.767
-Over here, ma'am.
-That's my car.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.600
-Okay. Just go over here.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.967
All right.
Can you, uh, tell me
what's goin' on here tonight?

15:38.067 --> 15:42.800
-Oh... see, we're splitting up,
Rick and I, and we so--
we sold the house

15:42.833 --> 15:44.700
and everything,
and I just got an apartment.

15:44.733 --> 15:47.933
-Mm-hm.
-And the reason I'm moving
is because my son--

15:47.967 --> 15:52.967
because he's like, old school.
My son just turned 21,
and I raised him myself,

15:53.067 --> 15:54.533
his whole life.
-Okay.

15:54.567 --> 15:58.800
-And he's not ready
to branch out, so I said
I'm gonna go and move

15:58.833 --> 16:01.700
with Sam, and get
our own apartment,
you know and everything's good.

16:01.733 --> 16:07.467
We're closing on March 17th.
But he's always had this thing
about my son bein' a baby.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.567
And Rick does
medication and drinks, and gets
a little silly sometimes,

16:11.600 --> 16:16.867
and I went into my son's room,
and as I walked in there,
Rick started going,

16:16.900 --> 16:20.900
"Ooh, Mommy, boo boo,
titty, boo boo," you know,
and all this stuff, you know.

16:20.933 --> 16:23.367
Like he does
when he's been drinking.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.333
-Was Sam instigatin' it
or was Rick?
-Rick did.

16:26.367 --> 16:28.067
-Rick was instigatin' it?
-Absolutely.

16:28.067 --> 16:30.767
-Okay.
-He-- He said somethin' to Sam
probably, you know,

16:30.800 --> 16:34.967
and Sam goes, "You're drunk,"
and I believe he is.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.700
-Okay.
-I really do.

16:36.733 --> 16:38.800
-Okay. Can you give me
a written statement
about what happened?

16:38.833 --> 16:40.233
-Sure.
-Okay.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.433
-I'm gonna go talk
to Rick real quick.
-Absolutely.

16:43.467 --> 16:47.167
-Richard... can I speak to you
real quick?

16:47.200 --> 16:51.500
Hi. I'm Cpl. Endricks, and I'm
conducting an investigation
about what happened.

16:51.533 --> 16:55.333
All right, so, uh, I spoke
to Sam, and is it
your girlfriend?

16:55.367 --> 16:57.700
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. How long you guys
been together for?

16:57.733 --> 16:58.900
-About three years.

16:58.933 --> 17:00.500
-And you live together?
-Yes, sir.

17:00.533 --> 17:03.800
-Is-- Is Sam your child?
-No, it's her-- it's--
that's hers.

17:03.833 --> 17:06.533
-Okay.
Tell me what happened.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.267
-Well, like I told the officer
there, I'm just sittin'
in my easy chair,

17:09.300 --> 17:13.133
my TV was kinda loud.
He got right in my face.

17:13.167 --> 17:17.067
He said I was drunk
and all kinds of (bleep),
so I just jumped up like that...

17:17.067 --> 17:18.800
-Mm-hm.
-...and I went at him--

17:18.833 --> 17:21.167
-No, back up, back up,
you don't have to get
too close to me.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.200
-No, I won't. I'm just sayin'.
-All right.

17:23.233 --> 17:25.067
-And then, he-- he whapped me.

17:25.067 --> 17:26.233
-Where did he
hit you at?

17:26.267 --> 17:28.067
-Right here.
-That's where he hit you?

17:28.067 --> 17:29.233
-Yeah.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.533
-Get a light out.
-I mean, I didn't do it.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.600
-Okay, it's kinda weird
because, it doesn't look
like a punch mark

17:39.633 --> 17:41.700
on your forehead.
Is that from fallin'
on the ground?

17:41.733 --> 17:44.767
-I don't know, it--
it happened quick.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.767
-Okay, I conducted
my investigation that took
everyone's statements,

17:47.800 --> 17:50.400
and what everyone said,
and I also took
the physical evidence,

17:50.433 --> 17:51.567
which is the injury
that you have.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.167
There's an injury
on Sam himself, okay?

17:54.200 --> 17:57.067
Based on my investigation,
I have determined that you
are the primary aggressor

17:57.067 --> 18:00.533
in a domestic battery situation
or offense, so I'm gonna ask you
to just stand up for me,

18:00.567 --> 18:02.233
and turn around
and put your hands
behind your back.

18:02.267 --> 18:03.300
-Okay.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.267
-Let go of your hands.
You don't touch your hands.
There you go.

18:09.767 --> 18:12.100
All right, you got anything
on you I should know about?

18:12.133 --> 18:14.133
-Uh, an inhaler.
-Is that it?

18:14.167 --> 18:15.467
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:16.467 --> 18:19.733
Okay. So, just to explain
to you,

18:19.767 --> 18:23.067
um, Richard's being
placed under arrest
for domestic battery.

18:23.067 --> 18:26.500
All right?
He'll be going to Pasco County
Detention Center.

18:26.533 --> 18:29.300
I'm gonna give you
a domestic violence
booklet. There's resources

18:29.333 --> 18:30.900
in there that you
can look at.

18:30.933 --> 18:33.433
And if you need
to get an injunction,
it'll explain how to do that.

18:33.467 --> 18:34.600
Do you understand
what's goin' on?

18:34.633 --> 18:36.633
-I do.
We're moving this weekend.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.300
I mean, it's like,
kinda ironic, you know,

18:39.333 --> 18:42.500
but he's always
had this thing about my son,
and I don't know why.

18:42.533 --> 18:45.800
You know?
He's a good kid.
-Mm-hm.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.733
So, you got up
outta the chair?

18:47.767 --> 18:51.900
-After a while, I just got tired
of him yellin' at me,
right in my face,

18:51.933 --> 18:53.600
so I just got up.
-Mm-hm.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.800
-And he probably thought
I was gonna do somethin',

18:55.833 --> 18:59.067
and struck me back and hit me.
-He struck you back?

18:59.067 --> 19:01.767
Okay. Well, see,
that's what I'm basin' it
upon is just,

19:01.800 --> 19:03.867
in the investigation,
when I say you're
primary aggressor.

19:03.900 --> 19:07.400
Based on what
you're tellin' me, you got up...
-All I did was get up.

19:07.433 --> 19:10.500
-...but they're claiming
that you actually
did hit him.

19:10.533 --> 19:13.333
-Well... I lost my balance.

19:13.367 --> 19:15.800
-And he's got physical
injuries, too.
-He does?

19:15.833 --> 19:17.867
-Yes. All right?
-Yeah.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.733
-All right, let's get you
over to the car.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.667
-I got balance problems.
-All right, I got you.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.667
-(grunts)
-Let me give you
his stuff, too.

19:31.700 --> 19:35.567
-Need a bag where you're goin'.
All right, just give me
a second, all right?

19:35.600 --> 19:39.267
-I think a combination
of the medication
and the alcohol

19:39.300 --> 19:40.900
is what did it for him.

19:40.933 --> 19:44.367
-Yeah.
-And he just got physical
tonight, so...

19:44.400 --> 19:47.067
he'll spend the night
in jail, hopefully sober up
a little bit,

19:47.067 --> 19:49.333
and things'll
work out later.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.533
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.533 --> 19:55.667
Cover is code three.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.667
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.367 --> 20:06.400
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.433 --> 20:09.467
-(theme music playing)
