01:39.911 --> 01:41.381
Ray.

01:41.414 --> 01:42.347
Ray.

01:46.424 --> 01:47.792
Ray, Ray, Ray...

01:47.826 --> 01:48.760
Home's the other way.

01:48.795 --> 01:50.331
Remember?

02:10.568 --> 02:13.339
I gotta go!

02:14.475 --> 02:16.245
Go ahead, DeeDee.

02:17.882 --> 02:20.787
I gotta go!

02:20.820 --> 02:23.692
I said, go ahead, DeeDee!

02:44.832 --> 02:46.335
Kent?

02:46.368 --> 02:47.937
You awake?

02:47.971 --> 02:49.307
Kent?

02:52.447 --> 02:53.748
Good morning.

02:55.953 --> 02:59.393
Here, take two of these.

03:01.896 --> 03:03.132
There you go.

03:03.165 --> 03:04.099
Here.

03:09.878 --> 03:11.848
What? No more vikes?

03:11.883 --> 03:14.721
Kent, you gotta take your
meds when you're supposed

03:14.754 --> 03:16.858
to or you're gonna
run out of them.

03:16.893 --> 03:18.395
I mean it.

03:19.431 --> 03:20.733
Here.

03:26.242 --> 03:28.379
This rash doesn't look so good.

03:35.592 --> 03:36.594
Hey!

03:36.629 --> 03:38.667
I'm done!

03:52.358 --> 03:53.659
Hey, Todd. Todd!

03:53.693 --> 03:55.830
I'm moving it in a sec.
Don't worry about it.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.902
Todd, wait.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.177
She's screaming
a lot today.

04:02.211 --> 04:03.312
I'll see what I can do.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.780
Now I don't wanna
have to do it.

04:04.814 --> 04:08.487
But if she doesn't stop,
I'm going to call the police.

04:08.521 --> 04:10.658
Lucky for you, here I am.

04:10.693 --> 04:12.896
Ha! That says reserves.

04:12.930 --> 04:14.467
You're not a real cop.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.870
Real enough to arrest
you for trespassing.

04:16.903 --> 04:19.442
Now get off our property.

04:21.745 --> 04:23.281
Get off our property.

04:23.314 --> 04:25.952
Parks his damn bus in
my driveway every day.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.835
How's the aquarium coming?

04:51.870 --> 04:54.540
Leaks, spills.

04:54.574 --> 04:57.444
You gotta take everything
into consideration.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.651
Yes, sir.

05:00.685 --> 05:02.923
Complex.

05:02.956 --> 05:04.791
What's complex about it?

05:04.826 --> 05:07.363
Nothing, I was just...

05:07.398 --> 05:09.936
It just seems like you're
doing a ton of work on it.

05:09.970 --> 05:10.803
Got your laundry, Todd.

05:10.838 --> 05:12.274
Thanks, ma.

05:14.310 --> 05:16.247
Yeah, another one of these
Gulf War veterans died and

05:16.281 --> 05:17.382
they don't know why.

05:17.416 --> 05:18.651
Cause unknown.

05:18.685 --> 05:19.786
Let me see that.

05:19.822 --> 05:22.293
She's getting into
the walls again.

05:22.326 --> 05:24.362
Cause unknown,
my Irish ass.

05:24.396 --> 05:26.366
What the hell is she doing
inside those walls anyway,

05:26.399 --> 05:27.902
for Christ's sakes?

05:27.937 --> 05:28.770
Who's in the walls?

05:28.803 --> 05:29.838
Your sister.

05:29.874 --> 05:32.044
There's nothing
in these walls.

05:33.312 --> 05:34.915
No insulation.

05:34.949 --> 05:36.985
Things rattle
around, maybe a mouse.

05:37.021 --> 05:39.758
How your parents bought a
house with no insulation,

05:39.791 --> 05:40.993
I'll never understand.

05:41.995 --> 05:42.461
You gonna...

05:42.497 --> 05:44.399
Give me the phone.

05:49.343 --> 05:50.712
Yeah, hello.

05:52.048 --> 05:54.385
Well how do you
know that for sure?

05:56.357 --> 05:57.325
Right.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.091
Okay.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.827
Alright. Bye.

06:00.831 --> 06:03.535
Willy Crum is fooling
with DeeDee again.

06:03.569 --> 06:05.439
I heard it on the news
so it must be true.

06:05.473 --> 06:07.375
Yeah, big joke.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.045
Fooling?

06:08.077 --> 06:09.745
What do you mean fooling?

06:09.781 --> 06:10.615
It's nothing.

06:10.649 --> 06:11.548
Settle down.

06:11.584 --> 06:12.718
That was the box factory.

06:12.754 --> 06:13.789
They're tired of it.

06:13.822 --> 06:14.956
Who the hell are
the box factory?

06:14.990 --> 06:17.461
Who the hell are they?

06:17.495 --> 06:18.596
What's he doing?

06:18.630 --> 06:19.598
Nothing, it's nothing.

06:19.632 --> 06:20.367
Now stop it.

06:20.401 --> 06:20.901
I'm gonna slap him.

06:20.935 --> 06:21.969
No, you're not.

06:22.002 --> 06:23.605
He's retarded
for god's sakes.

06:23.639 --> 06:24.941
I don't care that
he's retarded.

06:24.975 --> 06:27.612
Willy Crum. Willy coming?

06:27.648 --> 06:28.717
Hey, sweetie, look at you.

06:28.750 --> 06:29.783
You got dressed.

06:29.817 --> 06:30.819
Good girl.

06:30.853 --> 06:31.788
Where Willy?

06:31.822 --> 06:33.623
-Sweetheart.
-Let me get you some breakfast.

06:33.658 --> 06:36.062
Sweetheart, you gotta
stay out of the walls.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.398
I'm not. Where Willy?

06:37.432 --> 06:38.567
Come and sit down.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.002
DeeDee, is that guy
messing with you?

06:40.036 --> 06:41.038
I'm not.

06:41.072 --> 06:42.108
Bathroom!

06:42.141 --> 06:43.442
-Bathroom!
-Just sit down.

06:43.476 --> 06:44.111
Sweetie.

06:44.146 --> 06:45.615
No bathroom now.

06:45.648 --> 06:46.349
Bathroom.

06:46.382 --> 06:48.051
-No bathroom now.
-Bathroom.

06:48.086 --> 06:49.821
-DeeDee...
-No, bathroom.

06:49.855 --> 06:50.856
Alright, alright.

06:50.891 --> 06:52.360
-Take it easy. Take it easy.
-Leave her alone.

06:52.394 --> 06:53.930
DeeDee. DeeDee.
Ed, leave her alone!

06:55.567 --> 06:56.400
DeeDee, don't.

06:56.434 --> 06:59.072
I'm going to the bathroom.

06:59.107 --> 07:00.040
Now that's enough.
That's enough!

07:00.074 --> 07:00.941
No, bathroom!

07:00.975 --> 07:01.776
I am warning you!

07:01.810 --> 07:03.747
-Going to bathroom.
-Now stop it!

07:03.781 --> 07:05.517
Ed, do you remember what
happened the last time you

07:05.552 --> 07:06.887
tried to stop her?

07:06.920 --> 07:09.858
Bathroom!

07:09.891 --> 07:11.495
DeeDee.

07:24.786 --> 07:26.355
-I got it.
-Okay.

07:26.389 --> 07:27.759
Alright, that's good.

07:27.793 --> 07:29.362
-You got it?
-Yeah.

07:29.396 --> 07:31.432
Would someone
come up here?

07:34.439 --> 07:35.073
Are you okay, Kent?

07:36.076 --> 07:36.843
Hey, hey.

07:36.877 --> 07:38.513
Hey, you alright?

07:41.084 --> 07:44.024
I've been better.

07:46.961 --> 07:49.533
Pain.

07:50.836 --> 07:52.472
No, I got it.

07:53.608 --> 07:55.644
Just help me...

07:55.678 --> 07:58.617
Get around the base.

08:03.059 --> 08:05.862
I've been killing
it on reserves.

08:05.898 --> 08:08.502
I was out with these
two cops last night.

08:08.535 --> 08:10.138
I made three arrests.

08:10.172 --> 08:14.914
I almost took out my
gun, but I didn't.

08:16.850 --> 08:19.355
I wish you'd seen it.

08:21.091 --> 08:23.495
Mind if I smoke?

08:23.529 --> 08:24.899
No.

08:25.701 --> 08:28.774
DeeDee's acting up again.

08:28.807 --> 08:30.744
Insane.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.014
She...

08:34.049 --> 08:35.784
She knocked dad
right on his ass.

08:38.658 --> 08:40.729
Aw, I wish I
could've seen that.

08:42.532 --> 08:43.967
He went down
like a ton of bricks.

08:47.708 --> 08:49.077
Smashed together.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.848
Nope, no, no, nope.

08:51.883 --> 08:55.187
I got it. I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

08:55.222 --> 08:56.156
Okay.

08:58.995 --> 09:01.033
Check it out.

09:02.903 --> 09:04.474
What?

09:05.075 --> 09:06.443
What is it?

09:06.476 --> 09:08.145
You remember?

09:09.014 --> 09:12.455
You shut 'em out
and had four hits.

09:13.022 --> 09:15.158
You were great.

09:15.193 --> 09:17.798
That was the night everybody
said you were going to the show.

09:17.831 --> 09:19.600
Todd.

09:19.634 --> 09:20.903
Todd.

09:21.672 --> 09:23.609
Can I have the cigarette?

09:24.845 --> 09:27.016
Yes, here.

09:30.054 --> 09:32.458
Man.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.698
You should do
something with this.

09:53.231 --> 09:54.966
I'll see you in a little
while, champ, alright?

10:13.134 --> 10:15.671
I'm not really gonna
call the cops, Todd.

10:15.705 --> 10:18.576
But hey, we're
old, you know?

10:18.610 --> 10:20.648
Yeah, I know,
Mrs. Salisbury.

10:20.682 --> 10:21.817
I'm sorry, too.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.854
Merry Christmas.

10:58.352 --> 11:00.289
Hey, Willy!

11:01.890 --> 11:04.062
If I thought you were
messing with my sister,

11:04.096 --> 11:07.001
I'd wipe the
streets with you.

11:45.740 --> 11:47.310
Ed, Willy's at the door.

11:47.344 --> 11:49.347
Can you let him in?

12:04.775 --> 12:06.144
Alright,
come on in, Willy.

12:06.178 --> 12:07.313
Stop right there, son.

12:07.346 --> 12:09.283
Stop right there.

12:09.317 --> 12:10.787
Don't go running through
the house, Willy.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.323
DeeDee.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.225
Willy.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.230
Stop right there, son.

12:17.198 --> 12:21.173
Willy, you can't
touch DeeDee anymore.

12:21.206 --> 12:23.075
But there's cookies.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.047
Have a cookie, Willy.

12:27.885 --> 12:30.289
It isn't right.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.227
There's apples?

12:33.263 --> 12:36.168
Alright, have
an apple, Willy.

12:37.702 --> 12:41.042
Willy, did you understand
what I just said?

12:42.813 --> 12:45.049
Don't eat the core.

12:45.083 --> 12:46.653
Willy...

12:51.028 --> 12:52.163
-Not one.
-Just one.

12:52.197 --> 12:53.265
-Not one.
-Just one.

12:53.299 --> 12:55.034
-Not one.
-Just one.

12:55.068 --> 12:56.103
Okay, alright.

12:56.139 --> 12:56.940
Cut it out.

12:56.972 --> 12:58.174
Alright, come on.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.276
Let's go.
The van is waiting.

12:59.311 --> 13:00.479
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.349
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.984
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:07.826 --> 13:08.760
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:08.796 --> 13:09.363
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.033
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:11.067 --> 13:12.034
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:12.068 --> 13:13.303
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:13.336 --> 13:14.236
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:14.272 --> 13:15.139
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:15.173 --> 13:16.308
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:16.342 --> 13:17.410
Come on. Come on.

13:17.445 --> 13:19.782
Okay, let's load up, folks.

13:19.816 --> 13:21.051
Not one.

13:27.328 --> 13:30.132
Alright, Crum, no snacks
if that continues.

13:30.168 --> 13:31.804
Willy, come on.

13:31.839 --> 13:32.739
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:32.774 --> 13:33.942
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:33.975 --> 13:36.346
-Not one.
-Just one.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.085
Bye, mommy.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.019
Bye, sweetie.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.039
Bye!

14:13.984 --> 14:15.453
Just one.

14:20.395 --> 14:21.931
Just one.

14:21.965 --> 14:23.701
Not one.

14:35.957 --> 14:36.925
Alright, come on.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.128
Everybody back to work.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.197
Let's go, come on.

14:40.232 --> 14:41.533
What's going on in here?

14:52.087 --> 14:52.954
Hey!

14:52.989 --> 14:55.526
How's your brother doing?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.461
Good.

14:56.495 --> 14:57.196
Great.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.264
Better.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.400
I never see him.

14:59.436 --> 15:01.104
He doesn't get out much.

15:01.138 --> 15:02.907
That's too bad.

15:02.941 --> 15:04.076
The hell of a ball player.

15:04.110 --> 15:05.478
Absolutely.

15:05.511 --> 15:07.014
He was the best.

15:07.048 --> 15:08.783
Should've gone pro.

15:08.818 --> 15:11.155
Went to Iraq instead.

15:11.957 --> 15:16.264
Well, can't play for the
Yankees, might as well go

15:16.299 --> 15:18.201
play for Uncle Sam.

15:21.542 --> 15:24.447
How come you never played?

15:24.481 --> 15:26.216
I did.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.121
Yeah!

15:37.239 --> 15:38.540
What...

15:38.573 --> 15:40.375
What can I get you?

15:40.410 --> 15:43.916
I'll have a
glass of red wine.

15:43.951 --> 15:45.888
Red wine.

15:45.921 --> 15:47.323
And an application.

15:47.357 --> 15:48.926
I'm looking for a job.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.964
Well, I wish I
could help you.

15:56.307 --> 15:57.910
What's your name, honey?

15:57.943 --> 15:59.111
Jessie.

15:59.145 --> 16:00.313
Why don't you
put your...

16:00.347 --> 16:01.950
your number down, Jessie?

16:01.984 --> 16:05.023
You know, if I hear of anything,
I'll let you know.

16:07.094 --> 16:08.997
Drink's on the house.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.332
Hey, thanks.

16:16.344 --> 16:18.246
-She's new in town.
-Mhm.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.183
She's got no wedding ring.

16:21.889 --> 16:23.057
You want me to
introduce you?

16:23.090 --> 16:24.091
No.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.929
No, no, never
been good at that.

16:56.119 --> 16:57.354
Thank you for calling
the Veteran Affairs

16:57.389 --> 16:59.224
claim assistance hotline.

16:59.256 --> 17:01.125
If you're calling to
request a copy of a

17:01.160 --> 17:04.098
document relating to your
VA record, please submit

17:04.134 --> 17:08.174
the signed, written statement to
your local regional office.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.343
If you would like to speak...

17:17.259 --> 17:18.492
Lift 'em.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.935
Going to dance?

17:23.971 --> 17:25.307
Yeah, honey.

17:25.339 --> 17:27.175
Going to Christmas dance?

17:27.210 --> 17:29.581
Yes, I said yes.
Lift your arm.

17:31.517 --> 17:34.456
Christmas dance at the
box factory, I'm going?

17:34.490 --> 17:36.160
Yes, I said yes.

17:36.193 --> 17:38.596
You're going to the Christmas
dance at the box factory.

17:38.631 --> 17:39.934
Lift this arm.

17:40.469 --> 17:42.270
I am, jerk.

17:43.941 --> 17:44.942
Willy, too?

17:44.977 --> 17:48.149
I don't know, honey.
Stop moving. Stop moving.

17:51.555 --> 17:53.525
I love him.

17:53.558 --> 17:57.634
Willy Crum, he's
the one I love.

17:58.568 --> 18:00.372
Keep... keep your arm up,
just another...

18:00.404 --> 18:02.206
I am. I hate you!

18:02.241 --> 18:04.479
There is no reason to
act this way, okay?

18:04.512 --> 18:06.180
No one is hurting you.

18:06.214 --> 18:08.018
Now stop playing
with the water.

18:08.053 --> 18:09.088
I'm not, alright!

18:09.123 --> 18:11.393
DeeDee, I am warning you,
stop hitting the water!

18:11.425 --> 18:14.262
You're like a jerk!

18:16.701 --> 18:19.406
I want Willy.

19:14.743 --> 19:17.314
License and registration, ma'am.

19:45.535 --> 19:47.403
Get in bed and turn over.

19:59.461 --> 20:01.130
DeeDee.

20:02.164 --> 20:04.735
Did Willy Crum put his
fingers in you again?

20:04.770 --> 20:06.539
No, sir.

20:09.211 --> 20:09.813
Finger.

20:09.846 --> 20:10.882
DeeDee.

20:10.914 --> 20:15.087
If he does that, or if he
tries to do that again,

20:15.123 --> 20:17.594
don't let him and
tell Mr. Jenkins.

20:17.626 --> 20:18.628
I love him, you know.

20:18.663 --> 20:20.666
Jesus Christ.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.636
John F. Kennedy.

20:22.671 --> 20:23.571
Not tonight.

20:23.605 --> 20:27.345
John F. Kennedy!

20:27.378 --> 20:29.348
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

20:29.383 --> 20:31.487
His brother, Bobby.

20:31.519 --> 20:34.356
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

20:34.392 --> 20:35.293
Pope Paul.

20:35.327 --> 20:36.296
The lawn.

20:36.328 --> 20:37.096
Pope Pious.

20:37.131 --> 20:38.233
The lawn.

20:38.266 --> 20:39.267
Pope John.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.368
The lawn.

20:40.403 --> 20:42.407
Pancake, the cat
the car smashed.

20:42.441 --> 20:43.174
The lawn.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.578
They're all mowing
Jesus' lawn.

20:45.613 --> 20:47.449
Jesus loves them.

20:47.482 --> 20:49.118
Yeah, honey.

20:49.153 --> 20:51.356
Cause they do the lawn.

20:51.391 --> 20:54.462
Yeah, let's get to sleep
before Jesus looks down

20:54.496 --> 20:57.200
for some new helpers.

20:57.234 --> 20:58.804
He won't, will he?

20:58.837 --> 21:01.607
Not if we move along.

21:23.616 --> 21:27.255
Willy Crum, he
loves me you know.

21:27.290 --> 21:29.394
I know.

21:29.429 --> 21:30.797
I know.

21:30.829 --> 21:33.201
Everybody knows.

21:41.683 --> 21:44.923
They're sending a bunch of
weapons inspectors back to Iraq.

21:44.957 --> 21:46.626
I wish I was going.

21:46.660 --> 21:49.264
Bet your butt I'd come
back with a good war story.

21:49.298 --> 21:50.700
There's no such thing.

21:50.733 --> 21:52.169
What about dad's?

21:52.204 --> 21:53.572
We're enjoying
ourselves...

21:53.606 --> 21:55.475
I don't need to
hear that again.

21:55.510 --> 21:57.312
Hear what again?

21:57.346 --> 21:59.384
We were just trying to
remember your war story.

21:59.417 --> 22:00.519
Todd.

22:00.551 --> 22:02.221
Nothing to remember.

22:02.256 --> 22:04.727
What are you
talking about?

22:04.759 --> 22:06.663
We were enjoying
ourselves on the beach.

22:06.698 --> 22:09.169
Come on, dad.
You tell it.

22:09.201 --> 22:11.138
No.

22:11.173 --> 22:13.542
We'd only been in
country a few weeks.

22:13.576 --> 22:16.315
We hadn't seen
any action yet.

22:23.829 --> 22:28.303
I'm taking the entry exam for
the police force next week.

22:28.337 --> 22:29.539
Again?

22:29.573 --> 22:32.277
I'm gonna ace
it this time.

22:34.715 --> 22:36.652
Did you get smarter or
did the test get dumber?

22:37.622 --> 22:39.558
Todd, let your dad eat.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.862
No, I gotta good feeling.

22:41.895 --> 22:44.835
I'm doing really
good on my patrols.

22:44.868 --> 22:46.737
The reserves.

22:46.771 --> 22:48.573
You gotta do the volunteer
stuff if you wanna get

22:48.608 --> 22:50.611
into the academy.

22:50.645 --> 22:52.382
I do all the same things.

22:52.416 --> 22:53.985
I assist on arrests.

22:54.019 --> 22:56.256
I carry a gun.

22:56.289 --> 22:57.826
No pay though.

22:57.858 --> 23:00.696
That day is not far off.

23:00.731 --> 23:03.302
The cops don't
want you, Todd.

23:03.336 --> 23:05.507
The military turned
you down, too.

23:05.540 --> 23:07.442
You're just not that
kind of material.

23:07.477 --> 23:09.480
Face it.

23:17.864 --> 23:18.798
I love you, ma.

23:18.833 --> 23:20.634
-Love you, too.
-Yeah.

23:24.609 --> 23:26.579
Real nice, Ed.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.515
He's not being realistic.

23:31.722 --> 23:33.826
The situation
with Willy Crum,

23:33.859 --> 23:36.764
we have tried
everything to stop it.

23:36.798 --> 23:38.769
They're in love.

23:38.801 --> 23:40.771
Love to a...

23:40.806 --> 23:42.375
Retarded person.

23:42.410 --> 23:43.979
It's still love.

23:44.011 --> 23:45.780
Mentally
challenged adults.

23:45.816 --> 23:48.887
When my daughter was
born, it was retarded.

23:48.921 --> 23:50.990
I'll stick with
that, thanks.

23:51.026 --> 23:54.432
My retarded daughter
has feelings.

23:54.464 --> 23:56.040
Of course.

23:56.075 --> 23:59.441
I don't trust you agreeing
with me so you can stop it.

24:16.905 --> 24:20.412
Every time an alarm
goes off, he goes off.

24:20.446 --> 24:21.681
He does it for DeeDee.

24:21.714 --> 24:25.621
He does it because he
can't help himself.

24:25.656 --> 24:28.028
You can't blame
DeeDee for that.

24:28.061 --> 24:30.698
You see how
disruptive it is.

24:30.732 --> 24:33.971
Yeah, not so good for
the box business?

24:34.006 --> 24:35.007
What do you pay
these people?

24:35.039 --> 24:36.976
Twenty bucks a week?

24:37.010 --> 24:38.178
I resent that.

24:38.212 --> 24:40.684
Mrs. Kendall, we're providing
a community service here.

24:40.718 --> 24:44.692
Yeah, but you have to
allow for their behaviors.

24:51.503 --> 24:54.040
DeeDee placed this in a
box on its way down the

24:54.076 --> 24:55.979
assembly line.

24:56.013 --> 24:58.050
For Willy.

25:01.423 --> 25:02.791
It's a used maxi pad.

25:02.826 --> 25:05.631
I can see that.

25:05.664 --> 25:09.270
It's a gift.

25:09.305 --> 25:12.277
It's how she shows
her feelings.

25:12.309 --> 25:13.846
It's not sanitary.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.551
Don't tell me that my
daughter isn't sanitary.

25:16.585 --> 25:17.920
I keep that girl clean.

25:17.953 --> 25:20.657
We're not saying you don't
take good care of DeeDee,

25:20.692 --> 25:21.461
Mrs. Kendall.

25:21.493 --> 25:23.496
What if I keep her
home a few days?

25:23.531 --> 25:25.868
Mrs. Kendall...

25:25.903 --> 25:30.644
DeeDee cannot come back
to the box factory.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.785
This will explain
everything.

25:43.468 --> 25:44.870
Sweetheart,
we're just gonna go home.

25:44.904 --> 25:46.339
-No, I wanna go Willy.
-We're gonna go home.

25:46.374 --> 25:47.910
You didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

25:47.942 --> 25:50.381
-No.
-Come on, don't fight me, baby.

25:50.414 --> 25:51.951
I don't wanna go.

25:51.983 --> 25:52.817
Willy!

25:52.853 --> 25:53.620
Please, please, don't
give me trouble.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.153
-I wanna stay here, mommy.
-Okay?

25:54.186 --> 25:55.555
No, no, no. I know!

25:55.590 --> 25:56.825
I don't wanna go!

25:56.859 --> 25:58.628
I wanna stay with Willy!

25:58.663 --> 26:00.465
Honey, stop.
Stop it.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.403
-Mommy, no! I'm not gonna go!
-Calm down.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.571
Honey.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.538
-No!
-Stop.

26:04.574 --> 26:05.609
-No!
-Stop!

26:05.643 --> 26:07.613
-No.
-Stop it!

26:07.645 --> 26:09.315
Stop! Sweetheart, let go.

26:10.919 --> 26:11.653
No!

26:11.688 --> 26:12.588
Stop!

26:13.923 --> 26:14.959
DeeDee, no!

26:14.993 --> 26:16.362
DeeDee!

26:18.467 --> 26:19.435
DeeDee!

26:23.942 --> 26:24.978
DeeDee!

26:25.713 --> 26:27.548
DeeDee!

27:37.213 --> 27:41.087
They used to bring them in
and hook 'em up for you.

27:45.461 --> 27:47.499
I'll take a
Jack and ginger.

27:57.183 --> 27:58.853
Hold the Jack.

28:00.723 --> 28:02.091
Good for you.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.129
Good for me.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.946
Nice to see your
face in here again.

28:12.980 --> 28:13.846
You, too.

28:14.851 --> 28:16.553
Yeah.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.095
Kent's stuff's over there.

28:29.811 --> 28:32.750
Your other boy comes
in here sometimes.

28:36.692 --> 28:38.627
I wouldn't know.

28:47.211 --> 28:48.980
There they are.

28:49.013 --> 28:52.052
Alright. There you go, Ray.

28:52.086 --> 28:55.491
Look at these two
peas, Mark, Jamie.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.929
Alright.

29:02.972 --> 29:04.142
Can I come in?

29:06.246 --> 29:08.550
Thanks, sorry.

29:23.778 --> 29:26.115
Does this bus go all
the way to Tottenville?

29:26.151 --> 29:29.556
No, that's
actually the 59.

29:29.588 --> 29:31.091
It's a much larger bus.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.193
You know what, I
need to get off.

29:32.227 --> 29:32.961
I'm so sorry.

29:32.996 --> 29:33.663
No, no, no.

29:33.696 --> 29:34.529
Don't worry.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.999
I'll take you.

29:37.538 --> 29:39.574
Are you sure?

29:39.607 --> 29:41.878
Happy to do it.

29:51.931 --> 29:53.567
You...

29:54.970 --> 29:57.574
New in town?

29:57.607 --> 30:00.144
It's that obvious?

30:00.179 --> 30:01.816
Well...

30:01.849 --> 30:05.187
I don't mean anything
by it, it's just

30:05.222 --> 30:09.096
it's kind of a
forgotten place.

30:09.131 --> 30:11.168
That's what I'm
looking for.

30:13.171 --> 30:14.972
What's your name?

30:15.007 --> 30:17.077
I'm Jessie.

30:18.847 --> 30:20.250
Hi...

30:20.284 --> 30:22.588
I'm...

30:22.622 --> 30:24.659
Shit!

30:29.401 --> 30:31.004
Un-fucking-believable.

30:31.037 --> 30:31.870
No, no, no, I have this.

30:31.905 --> 30:33.707
-Get out of here, man.
-I have this.

30:33.742 --> 30:34.643
What is this?

30:34.679 --> 30:35.646
-It's a silver star.
-It's a silver star?

30:35.680 --> 30:36.714
What the fuck am I gonna
do with a silver star?

30:36.748 --> 30:37.950
No, it's silver. It's
gotta be worth something.

30:41.155 --> 30:42.157
What the fuck
are you doing?

30:42.192 --> 30:44.094
What the fuck
are you doing?

30:44.128 --> 30:45.363
That's your fucking
silver star.

30:45.397 --> 30:47.166
I don't care, it
doesn't mean anything!

30:47.201 --> 30:48.067
Get on the bus.

30:48.102 --> 30:49.204
No, stop it's my...

30:49.238 --> 30:51.307
No, no, no!

30:51.342 --> 30:52.978
I need something.

30:53.010 --> 30:54.779
I need something.

30:54.815 --> 30:55.950
I know, I know, I know.

30:55.983 --> 30:56.884
Get on the bus.

30:56.919 --> 30:58.153
Get on the bus.

31:06.670 --> 31:07.971
Stay on the bus.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.317
Ray, please no singing
right now, Ray.

31:13.349 --> 31:14.617
Please.

31:14.652 --> 31:16.020
I know, I know, I know.

31:16.890 --> 31:18.225
Just get in the seat.

31:18.259 --> 31:19.862
Just get in the seat.

31:19.895 --> 31:20.896
Just stay in the seat.

31:20.931 --> 31:23.701
Fine! Okay, okay, okay!

31:24.738 --> 31:26.240
Quiet!

31:26.273 --> 31:28.142
Fucking quiet!

31:34.957 --> 31:37.294
Can you let me off please?

31:52.155 --> 31:52.923
It's all alright.

31:52.957 --> 31:54.692
Everybody's alright.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.689
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

32:11.759 --> 32:14.296
I don't wanna go
in there and die!

32:14.329 --> 32:16.666
I don't wanna go in there!

32:17.402 --> 32:19.673
Yeah.

32:20.842 --> 32:22.177
Alright.

32:22.211 --> 32:23.945
-Alright.
-Alright?

32:23.980 --> 32:25.115
Come on.

32:25.150 --> 32:27.320
What are you looking at?

32:27.354 --> 32:29.023
Go inside.

32:29.057 --> 32:31.227
-Okay, I know.
-Honey, come on.

32:32.329 --> 32:34.064
What are you looking at?

32:34.099 --> 32:35.969
I'ma go inside.

32:39.442 --> 32:41.144
Okay.

33:03.020 --> 33:04.789
No need to tell
your father.

33:04.825 --> 33:06.862
Great.

33:28.969 --> 33:31.306
Don't waste your
time reading that.

33:41.526 --> 33:45.031
We have to consider
institutionalizing her.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.334
No.

33:46.367 --> 33:49.807
It's bad enough with Kent
pulling his act upstairs

33:49.840 --> 33:50.508
all these years.

33:50.542 --> 33:53.079
It's not an
act, he's sick.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.985
He came back from
the war sick.

33:56.019 --> 33:57.522
How is it you don't
understand that?

33:57.556 --> 33:59.058
Okay.

34:00.994 --> 34:02.029
What is that?

34:02.064 --> 34:04.268
What was what?

34:15.387 --> 34:16.989
She's in the
walls, I tell ya.

34:17.025 --> 34:19.963
She's tied to a bed
for Christ sakes.

34:23.070 --> 34:25.306
Look, Elaine...

34:25.340 --> 34:29.547
It's not just that she can't
go back to the box factory.

34:29.581 --> 34:31.985
It's the whole program.

34:32.018 --> 34:34.791
Medication is part
of that program.

34:34.826 --> 34:36.362
We can't afford
her medication.

34:36.393 --> 34:38.097
She's gonna go
off her meds.

34:38.132 --> 34:39.534
Don't you remember what
happened the last time?

34:39.568 --> 34:41.538
It took five of them
and a strait jacket.

34:41.570 --> 34:43.306
Jesus, they had to shoot
her with a tranquilizer

34:43.340 --> 34:46.312
gun like a damn animal!

34:46.347 --> 34:48.516
I'll find a way
to make it work.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.120
I'll get her in
another program.

34:50.152 --> 34:53.960
She's been in three programs
in the last two years.

35:13.597 --> 35:15.901
Remember how much fun we
all used to have when the

35:15.934 --> 35:18.005
kids were little?

35:20.510 --> 35:25.519
We'd eat dinner together for
Christmas, go to the dance.

35:25.552 --> 35:28.156
We were good dancers, Ed.

35:28.190 --> 35:30.527
Everybody said.

35:30.561 --> 35:35.170
And Kent was
everybody's favorite.

35:35.204 --> 35:38.911
Girls couldn't
get enough of him.

35:38.945 --> 35:44.086
They knew he was a caring
boy, a loving boy.

35:44.121 --> 35:45.489
In his Marine blues.

35:47.427 --> 35:49.229
They swooned.

35:49.262 --> 35:53.502
They fell like spent
flower petals at his feet.

35:56.043 --> 35:58.413
That was fun.

36:00.485 --> 36:04.191
Will we ever do
that again, Ed?

36:37.688 --> 36:40.092
Yeah, Kendall.

36:40.126 --> 36:42.429
K-E-N-D-A-L-L.

36:42.463 --> 36:44.567
The doctor knows me.

36:44.599 --> 36:45.900
I don't care.

36:45.936 --> 36:49.409
My kid needs help.

36:49.443 --> 36:50.578
He has to talk to me.

36:50.612 --> 36:52.347
Go and get him.

36:52.380 --> 36:53.415
Hold on, baby.

36:53.451 --> 36:55.219
Hold on. I can't...

36:55.253 --> 36:57.590
Doctor Mooney, it's
Elaine Kendall.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.161
Yeah, it's about Kent.

36:59.193 --> 37:00.663
He's run out of his meds.

37:01.798 --> 37:06.072
No, I know it's six days
until his next prescription.

37:06.106 --> 37:08.945
No, I don't care
about the law.

37:09.646 --> 37:12.351
You have to help us!

37:14.190 --> 37:15.659
Hello?

37:15.692 --> 37:17.295
Hello?

37:18.630 --> 37:20.500
Motherfucker!

37:22.103 --> 37:23.037
Alright, baby.

37:23.072 --> 37:24.675
Come on, we're
gonna go out.

37:24.708 --> 37:26.311
Come on.

37:26.344 --> 37:27.413
Come on. Sit up.

37:27.447 --> 37:29.017
Come on, we're gonna go
someplace and get some meds.

37:29.050 --> 37:30.621
Come on.

37:31.554 --> 37:33.290
Thank you.

37:46.248 --> 37:49.085
It's gonna be Christmas
this Saturday, DeeDee.

37:49.119 --> 37:51.223
You know what that means?

37:51.259 --> 37:54.998
Willy Crum put
his finger in me.

37:55.030 --> 37:58.369
You tell him not to.

37:58.403 --> 38:03.478
Big fish are gonna be
swimming in this tank soon.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.550
That's Christmas.

38:07.320 --> 38:10.057
That's the day
God's son was born.

38:10.092 --> 38:11.461
Fish?

38:11.496 --> 38:14.067
Fish, yeah.

38:15.568 --> 38:20.512
You know, DeeDee, enough
piranha can shred a full

38:20.545 --> 38:25.353
sized horse down to the
bone in under a minute.

38:25.387 --> 38:26.422
Yup.

38:26.456 --> 38:29.260
And those horses that are
getting eaten up after a

38:29.295 --> 38:32.600
while they don't care
because they go into shock.

38:32.635 --> 38:35.005
Shock.

38:35.039 --> 38:38.980
Shock is when you hurt so
bad that you don't feel

38:39.014 --> 38:41.518
anything anymore.

38:41.552 --> 38:43.689
It's a gift from Jesus.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.358
John F. Kennedy.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.693
Sug.

38:46.728 --> 38:48.496
Not now, honey, not...

38:48.530 --> 38:50.233
John F. Kennedy.

38:50.266 --> 38:52.670
Okay.

38:52.704 --> 38:54.741
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

38:54.777 --> 38:56.479
Joe DiMaggio.

38:56.512 --> 38:57.380
The lawn.

38:57.414 --> 39:00.052
Sid, the dog that
ate the rat poison.

39:00.085 --> 39:01.288
Doing the lawn, baby.

39:01.322 --> 39:03.224
They're all
doing the lawn.

39:03.257 --> 39:06.163
Jesus loves them.

39:06.197 --> 39:11.239
Well, he tolerates
their money.

39:13.177 --> 39:15.414
Mommy's here.

39:19.755 --> 39:21.392
Okay.

39:21.425 --> 39:23.094
Slow down.

39:23.128 --> 39:27.169
It's all okay now.

39:27.202 --> 39:28.070
Mommy's home.

39:28.105 --> 39:30.074
Mommy's here.

39:30.108 --> 39:31.476
Hey, kid.

39:31.510 --> 39:33.313
Hey, pop.

39:34.451 --> 39:38.257
They gave him a shot of
Demerol at the hospital.

39:38.291 --> 39:39.726
Great.

39:39.760 --> 39:44.101
Yeah, that was the nicest
people in the whole world.

39:44.135 --> 39:46.272
We'll go back there.

39:46.306 --> 39:48.710
That was a keeper.

39:50.780 --> 39:53.150
Gave me enough meds til
next week, then I'll get

39:53.184 --> 39:54.320
his refill.

39:54.353 --> 39:55.789
Even better.

39:58.260 --> 40:01.097
Because I was still...
That I was sick.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.235
You know?

40:03.271 --> 40:05.140
No fooling.

40:05.173 --> 40:06.409
They knew their business.

40:06.443 --> 40:07.244
They just...

40:08.579 --> 40:10.150
Psychosomatics.

40:10.182 --> 40:11.451
Psycho psychotics.

40:11.485 --> 40:13.422
Psycho traumatic.

40:13.456 --> 40:15.759
Gobbley, whoop-di-do!

40:15.793 --> 40:19.132
Just to peel our shit,
right to the vein.

40:22.606 --> 40:23.674
You!

40:23.708 --> 40:27.447
Okay, okay, take
it easy, Kent.

40:27.481 --> 40:28.617
Go easy.

40:28.652 --> 40:30.655
Woo!

40:30.688 --> 40:34.861
I forgot all these years.

40:34.894 --> 40:36.898
What?

40:36.934 --> 40:42.142
Just how pretty
your eyes are.

40:43.344 --> 40:45.848
I knew it.

40:45.882 --> 40:47.217
You're married.

40:47.251 --> 40:49.556
All the good ones are.

40:49.590 --> 40:53.329
I'm sure that he
does not deserve you.

40:57.806 --> 40:59.208
Okay.

40:59.842 --> 41:02.113
Okay, let's go, bud.

41:12.298 --> 41:14.737
Okay, kid, let's go.

41:14.769 --> 41:16.538
Upstairs.

41:20.447 --> 41:22.751
Look at that, daddy-o.

41:22.784 --> 41:25.322
Look at that.

41:27.327 --> 41:31.434
That was the Christmas
spirit in that hospital.

41:31.467 --> 41:32.335
Let's go upstairs.

41:32.369 --> 41:34.306
Okay.

41:42.922 --> 41:44.190
I'm going.

41:44.224 --> 41:45.861
-Alright.
-Okay.

41:48.666 --> 41:50.469
Tell me your war story.

41:50.503 --> 41:51.705
No, no, no.

41:51.739 --> 41:53.309
Not now.

41:54.711 --> 41:56.514
We were enjoying
ourselves.

41:56.548 --> 41:59.385
Yup, on the beach.

41:59.420 --> 42:01.356
Okay.

42:01.925 --> 42:03.561
That's all now.

42:08.771 --> 42:10.341
Come on, champ.

42:11.409 --> 42:13.211
Let's call it a night.

42:17.653 --> 42:20.257
You must hate me.

42:20.291 --> 42:22.962
I don't hate you.

42:22.996 --> 42:26.669
You don't come
up here no more.

42:26.704 --> 42:30.778
I'm here now, Kent.

42:36.956 --> 42:39.194
But you don't no more.

42:51.284 --> 42:56.760
We were enjoying
ourselves on the beach,

42:56.793 --> 42:59.266
it was getting dark.

42:59.297 --> 43:02.335
We'd been in
country a few weeks.

43:02.371 --> 43:04.608
But we hadn't seen
any action yet.

43:04.641 --> 43:07.579
We just finished building an air
strip so we were celebrating.

43:07.614 --> 43:12.222
Drinking beers, smoking,
goofing around, you know.

43:12.255 --> 43:14.693
And hey, it was.

43:14.726 --> 43:20.269
And after a while, everybody
went back to the camp.

43:20.304 --> 43:22.807
Except you.

43:22.842 --> 43:24.711
Except me.

43:24.746 --> 43:26.883
I stayed down
on the beach.

43:26.916 --> 43:29.355
I wanted to look
at the stars.

43:29.387 --> 43:31.757
That's when I saw them.

43:31.791 --> 43:33.996
They came out of the west.

43:34.030 --> 43:37.469
Four Chinese minks.

43:37.503 --> 43:39.338
They came in tandem, two
by two, and they dropped a

43:39.373 --> 43:41.776
shit load of bombs on us.

43:41.811 --> 43:46.952
Resulting in heavy
shrapnel dispersal.

43:46.987 --> 43:48.624
That's right.

43:48.657 --> 43:51.563
Heavy shrapnel dispersal.

43:51.596 --> 43:52.963
See?

43:52.998 --> 43:55.302
You know the rest
of the story.

43:55.336 --> 43:56.204
No, come on.

43:56.239 --> 43:58.342
Come on, there were
bombs everywhere.

44:00.445 --> 44:04.352
The bombs were everywhere.

44:04.387 --> 44:12.368
And I ran back to the camp
and they were all dead.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.471
All of them.

44:14.505 --> 44:16.541
Dead in their hammocks.

44:21.452 --> 44:24.590
Shredded.

44:24.623 --> 44:26.493
They were wrapped in them.

44:37.849 --> 44:39.885
Wrapped in their blood-drenched,
charred hammocks

44:39.918 --> 44:42.723
like sausages in
their casings.

44:52.610 --> 44:57.684
I was the only
one left alive.

44:57.719 --> 45:00.992
I was the only
one left alive.

45:02.393 --> 45:06.667
I wonder why you never
got a medal for that.

45:40.699 --> 45:42.368
Fuck!

45:52.086 --> 45:53.590
Here you go.

45:55.594 --> 45:57.965
You ever seen one
of these before?

45:57.998 --> 45:59.166
Yeah, sure.

45:59.201 --> 46:02.039
That's a silver star.

46:03.507 --> 46:05.811
They give it to
you for bravery.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.885
And they forget
all about you.

46:17.768 --> 46:19.338
How you doing?

46:23.445 --> 46:24.514
Todd!

46:25.014 --> 46:25.615
No, no, no!

46:25.648 --> 46:26.784
I didn't do anything, man!

46:26.818 --> 46:27.819
I'm not gonna hit you.

46:27.853 --> 46:30.024
I just wanna talk.

46:33.931 --> 46:35.501
You holding?

46:35.534 --> 46:36.569
Alright.

46:36.603 --> 46:37.638
Yeah.

46:42.849 --> 46:43.783
Just take all of it.

46:43.817 --> 46:45.387
Yeah, man.

46:50.795 --> 46:52.498
Merry Christmas.

46:52.532 --> 46:54.402
Alright.

47:08.996 --> 47:11.434
You may visit on the
weekends, but we do ask

47:11.467 --> 47:14.038
for twenty-four
hours notice.

47:14.072 --> 47:16.476
What if we wanna bring her
home for a couple of days?

47:16.512 --> 47:18.515
Well, not in the
first six months.

47:18.547 --> 47:22.020
Routine is very
important, Mr. Kendall.

47:26.027 --> 47:29.134
They have to get used to
the idea that this is now

47:29.168 --> 47:30.971
their home.

47:31.005 --> 47:33.476
What about at night?
Where do they sleep?

47:33.509 --> 47:36.914
Most sleep two,
three to a room.

47:37.851 --> 47:40.555
They get used to it.

48:11.746 --> 48:13.683
I dropped my picture.

48:13.717 --> 48:15.987
I'm not supposed
to leave the car.

48:16.021 --> 48:17.625
Aw!

48:18.760 --> 48:20.831
Sure, I'll get it for you.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.509
Here you go.

48:28.878 --> 48:30.982
I'm not finished yet.

48:32.853 --> 48:34.822
Do you like rabbits?

48:34.856 --> 48:36.860
Sure, I do.

48:39.599 --> 48:41.236
You can have this one.

48:42.271 --> 48:43.940
Wow.

48:43.974 --> 48:45.876
Are you all by
yourself our here?

48:45.911 --> 48:47.146
Yeah.

48:47.179 --> 48:48.047
You are?

48:48.081 --> 48:49.551
Hey, excuse me.

48:49.585 --> 48:50.552
Can I help you?

48:50.586 --> 48:53.090
Yeah, I was trying to
help the little girl.

48:53.123 --> 48:56.496
He asked me if
I was by myself.

48:57.199 --> 48:57.900
Come on, Annie.

48:57.932 --> 48:59.601
Let's go.

48:59.637 --> 49:00.905
Come on. You're coming
with me, let's go.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.006
Wait, this is a
misunderstanding.

49:02.041 --> 49:02.975
Okay.

49:03.978 --> 49:06.248
I'll send someone else
out to take your order.

49:06.282 --> 49:09.019
Come on. Watch your step.

49:09.054 --> 49:11.459
I said, don't talk to
strangers, right?

49:51.166 --> 49:52.636
Hey.

49:56.943 --> 49:58.146
Hey.

50:05.693 --> 50:07.062
Todd.

50:08.197 --> 50:10.601
I got you something.

50:23.693 --> 50:26.732
Are those oxy's?

50:29.103 --> 50:29.971
Thank you, Todd.

50:30.003 --> 50:31.172
Thank you.

50:31.206 --> 50:33.679
Just don't pull that shit
like you did on my bus again.

50:33.711 --> 50:34.646
Mhm.

50:34.681 --> 50:38.153
I don't want people
seeing you act that way.

50:38.186 --> 50:40.190
I'm sorry.

50:41.427 --> 50:45.266
I get so cramped up here.

50:52.179 --> 50:57.422
I get so fucking
swallowed up here.

50:58.958 --> 51:02.164
Then I run out of meds.

51:02.197 --> 51:04.934
I get suffocated.

51:05.739 --> 51:07.173
Go easy on those.

51:07.208 --> 51:09.744
Alright, they gotta last
you to your next refill?

51:16.760 --> 51:18.161
Who's your decorator, bro?

51:30.050 --> 51:31.853
How come you never
hear nothing on all

51:31.887 --> 51:34.792
these claims you got
against the Marines?

51:34.826 --> 51:39.065
Because they got an
answer for every problem.

51:41.170 --> 51:44.742
The rash, your problem.

51:44.777 --> 51:47.448
The long's your problem.

51:47.483 --> 51:52.325
No, it can't be linked to
anything specific.

51:52.358 --> 51:57.432
Yeah, no, no, it's not the
inoculations for anthrax

51:57.467 --> 52:00.038
and the others.

52:00.072 --> 52:04.814
No, it's not the
radioactive shells.

52:05.884 --> 52:09.925
That wouldn't cause the pain
that you're describing.

52:09.958 --> 52:15.066
We recommend psychiatric
counseling.

52:16.436 --> 52:17.838
It's standard.

52:17.873 --> 52:19.809
It's standard.

52:20.378 --> 52:23.317
Don't worry, here's
another form.

52:23.349 --> 52:28.025
Yeah, but I hear some people
get their claims approved.

52:33.969 --> 52:40.849
They wear you out
and hope you die.

52:42.318 --> 52:44.322
They're gonna
win this one.

52:45.456 --> 52:47.493
Don't say that shit, man.

52:47.527 --> 52:49.429
I hate when you do that.

52:49.465 --> 52:56.044
You're lucky I don't have
something more contagious.

52:56.077 --> 53:02.088
Some guys, they come back
so radioactive that they

53:02.121 --> 53:06.463
affect their
entire family.

53:09.501 --> 53:13.476
Glory to the pats.
Some war memorabilia.

53:16.983 --> 53:18.785
Give me that.

53:18.820 --> 53:19.788
Give me it.

53:19.822 --> 53:20.990
What is this?

53:21.023 --> 53:22.125
It's just a picture.
Give it to me.

53:22.159 --> 53:23.927
No kidding.

53:23.963 --> 53:25.398
What are you
doing with it?

53:25.431 --> 53:26.399
Give it to me.

53:26.434 --> 53:28.071
Okay.

53:38.255 --> 53:42.229
We, were following the
action after we liberated

53:42.264 --> 53:43.867
Kuwait.

53:43.900 --> 53:47.306
Just a young guy
looking to live.

53:47.338 --> 53:49.041
You must have helped
him out a lot.

53:49.076 --> 53:50.545
Yeah.

53:50.577 --> 53:52.380
We all helped him.

53:54.085 --> 53:56.990
We killed his
family by mistake.

53:58.860 --> 54:00.363
However it happened,
they died.

54:00.396 --> 54:01.398
I know.

54:01.432 --> 54:03.135
I get it.

54:04.137 --> 54:05.740
Get some rest.

54:06.340 --> 54:08.746
I woke up...

54:15.356 --> 54:20.867
I woke up and I did
know what was happening.

54:28.548 --> 54:30.920
I did know.

54:32.123 --> 54:35.061
He was on top of me.

54:35.094 --> 54:36.863
What are you
talking about?

54:36.898 --> 54:39.269
His mouth...

54:43.110 --> 54:44.813
on my cock.

54:47.016 --> 54:50.355
I really didn't
have to do anything.

54:50.389 --> 54:52.926
So I just went with it.

54:52.961 --> 54:54.431
Go to sleep, Kent.

54:54.465 --> 54:56.300
Stop talking
and go to sleep.

54:56.335 --> 54:58.338
I just needed you
to know something.

54:59.072 --> 55:00.541
Go to fucking sleep, Kent.

55:00.576 --> 55:02.545
My company command
that walked in...

55:02.579 --> 55:04.115
Go to fucking sleep, Kent!

55:04.148 --> 55:05.317
They did it!

55:05.351 --> 55:09.157
They drove me out of the Marines
for that night with Izzy.

55:16.271 --> 55:18.040
No, no, no!

55:19.010 --> 55:21.314
No, because
it's a mistake.

55:21.347 --> 55:24.487
My job, the bus, the
reserves, if they ever

55:24.521 --> 55:27.292
find out I got some fucking
loser junkie for a brother.

55:27.326 --> 55:30.231
No, I need 'em
for the pain, man!

55:30.264 --> 55:32.402
I just need 'em
for the pain!

55:36.911 --> 55:39.447
It's for the pain, Todd!

56:07.900 --> 56:09.002
Alright.

56:10.673 --> 56:12.876
Dee, take these cigarettes
up and put 'em on Kent's

56:12.911 --> 56:13.479
night table.

56:13.512 --> 56:14.446
No.

56:14.481 --> 56:16.517
He'll be looking for
'em when he wakes up.

56:16.550 --> 56:18.086
Then get ready for bed.

56:18.119 --> 56:19.188
No.

56:19.222 --> 56:20.391
Don't give me any guff.

56:42.431 --> 56:44.368
What'd you do to your thumb?

56:45.472 --> 56:47.609
It's nothing.

56:52.550 --> 56:56.525
I went to Sunrise,
Staten Island today.

56:56.557 --> 56:58.260
Had a look around.

56:58.295 --> 57:00.197
Without telling me?

57:00.233 --> 57:03.205
There's a chance they
might take DeeDee.

57:03.237 --> 57:04.605
You went there
without telling me?

57:04.639 --> 57:07.077
They got a really nice
bed there for her, honey.

57:07.110 --> 57:10.116
Sunrise is no
place for DeeDee.

57:10.150 --> 57:13.556
The people there are
much worse than DeeDee.

57:13.590 --> 57:15.228
She's better off
dead than there.

57:15.260 --> 57:16.561
So what do you wanna do?

57:16.596 --> 57:20.034
You wanna keep her here
with us and then she flips

57:20.068 --> 57:23.041
out and the cops come and
then health and human

57:23.074 --> 57:25.378
services come and they
haul her off to some

57:25.411 --> 57:28.617
dumping ground that's
worse than Sunrise.

57:28.652 --> 57:31.590
Atleast Sunrise is clean.

57:33.626 --> 57:35.963
You should've told me
about Sunrise, Ed.

57:37.702 --> 57:40.106
You should've told me that!

57:40.139 --> 57:41.942
I'm coming up DeeDee.

57:47.487 --> 57:49.456
Okay, DeeDee, sleep.

57:49.490 --> 57:51.693
I am, jerk.

57:51.728 --> 57:54.032
I hate you.

57:54.065 --> 57:55.400
I know, baby.

57:55.434 --> 57:57.170
Think you're big.

57:59.208 --> 58:00.476
Yup.

58:00.512 --> 58:02.015
Settle down now.

58:10.329 --> 58:11.998
Mommy, out. I don't wanna!

58:12.032 --> 58:13.268
Jesus Christ.

58:13.302 --> 58:15.606
Jesus Christ.

58:15.639 --> 58:17.575
John F. Kennedy.

58:17.610 --> 58:19.378
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

58:19.413 --> 58:20.748
His brother, Bobby.

58:20.782 --> 58:22.651
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

58:22.686 --> 58:24.322
The parakeet I ate.

58:24.356 --> 58:25.324
By mistake.

58:25.358 --> 58:26.527
Yeah.

58:26.559 --> 58:28.529
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

58:28.563 --> 58:29.531
The pope.

58:29.565 --> 58:30.331
The lawn.

58:30.367 --> 58:31.669
The other pope.

58:31.702 --> 58:34.007
That big lawn, baby.

58:34.041 --> 58:36.345
Kent's in his bedroom.

58:43.123 --> 58:44.626
What did you say?

58:44.659 --> 58:46.428
Kent's in bed.

58:46.463 --> 58:50.571
He's mowing Jesus' lawn.

59:45.672 --> 59:47.475
I'd like to do it.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.405
Just a little longer.

01:02:57.597 --> 01:02:59.634
Why didn't they
shoot for Kent?

01:03:00.871 --> 01:03:03.275
They're not gonna
do that, Elaine.

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.614
Why not?

01:03:06.648 --> 01:03:08.818
He was...

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.821
He didn't qualify.

01:03:10.856 --> 01:03:12.692
He's a veteran.

01:03:12.724 --> 01:03:15.797
He fought for his country.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:17.535
They owe him that!

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:19.573
-Mom, don't...
-Elaine.

01:03:27.652 --> 01:03:29.421
Elaine.

01:03:29.456 --> 01:03:29.958
Elaine.

01:03:29.992 --> 01:03:30.993
Stop it.
Stop it.

01:03:31.025 --> 01:03:31.993
-Let go of me.
-We have to stop.

01:03:32.028 --> 01:03:33.465
-Let go of me.
-Elaine!

01:03:33.498 --> 01:03:34.466
Stop!

01:03:34.501 --> 01:03:35.903
Stop!

01:03:39.878 --> 01:03:43.918
I want you to go over there
and shoot for my son.

01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:45.653
He's a veteran.

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.090
He's just like you.

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:48.023
He's a marine.

01:03:48.059 --> 01:03:50.329
If you knew my son,
you'd shoot for him.

01:03:50.364 --> 01:03:51.365
Please, sir, your wife.

01:03:51.398 --> 01:03:52.634
Please?
Please?

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:53.601
Please.

01:03:53.635 --> 01:03:54.436
Please?

01:03:54.471 --> 01:03:55.038
Please?

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:55.938
Bastard.

01:03:55.972 --> 01:03:57.675
Heartless bastard.

01:03:58.945 --> 01:04:00.680
Look what you're doing.

01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:10.835
Get DeeDee and go home.

01:04:11.603 --> 01:04:12.938
Okay.

01:04:13.873 --> 01:04:15.675
Listen to your mother.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.998
Ma'am.

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:29.233
Ma'am.

01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:34.545
I'll shoot off a few rounds
for your boy if you want.

01:04:34.577 --> 01:04:35.980
Yeah?

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.355
Thanks.

01:04:41.123 --> 01:04:42.324
Could you shoot seven?

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.831
Heck, ma'am, I'll shoot all
twenty-one if you can stand it.

01:04:44.864 --> 01:04:46.935
I can stand it.

01:07:40.893 --> 01:07:43.030
What are you doing?

01:07:53.182 --> 01:07:56.755
I'm gonna go to bed now.

01:08:02.634 --> 01:08:04.936
Ed, you can sleep in
the bedroom any...

01:08:04.969 --> 01:08:07.106
anytime you want.

01:08:07.141 --> 01:08:11.549
I, I'm in no
shape for that.

01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:13.119
Snoring and everything, I...

01:08:13.152 --> 01:08:14.788
I don't mind.
Not so much.

01:08:14.822 --> 01:08:16.993
I know. I don't
think I-I can.

01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:19.197
Maybe just tonight.

01:08:23.238 --> 01:08:26.176
I can't, honey.

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:49.886
What am I gonna do now?

01:09:16.136 --> 01:09:18.037
I'm gonna make
you some tea.

01:09:21.613 --> 01:09:23.550
Jesus Christ.

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:24.786
Willy.

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:26.087
My god, DeeDee!

01:09:26.122 --> 01:09:27.557
Dee!

01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:29.827
DeeDee!

01:09:29.863 --> 01:09:30.663
Willy!

01:09:30.697 --> 01:09:31.798
Hold up! Hold up!

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.621
Willy!

01:09:44.657 --> 01:09:45.890
Willy!

01:09:45.926 --> 01:09:47.227
Willy!

01:09:47.261 --> 01:09:49.331
Willy!

01:09:49.363 --> 01:09:50.966
Willy!

01:09:51.002 --> 01:09:52.270
Willy!

01:09:52.304 --> 01:09:54.641
Willy.

01:09:54.675 --> 01:09:56.912
Willy.

01:09:56.947 --> 01:09:58.081
Willy.

01:09:58.113 --> 01:10:00.284
Willy.

01:10:05.695 --> 01:10:06.697
Okay?

01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:08.132
Yeah.

01:10:16.314 --> 01:10:17.784
She'll be alright.

01:10:20.957 --> 01:10:22.193
Sh!

01:10:23.395 --> 01:10:25.699
Did you hear that?

01:10:25.734 --> 01:10:27.203
Hear what?

01:10:27.235 --> 01:10:29.104
I didn't hear anything.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:31.177
There it is again.

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.382
I heard it.

01:10:34.416 --> 01:10:35.818
Me too.

01:10:35.853 --> 01:10:37.922
Sh! Sh! Sh!

01:10:47.975 --> 01:10:49.176
What the fuck?

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:50.778
No, don't, don't.

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:51.780
I knew it.

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.351
Just one.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:56.221
-Willy.
-Just one.

01:10:56.256 --> 01:11:00.264
Get out of the wall and come
into the house the right way.

01:11:02.903 --> 01:11:07.244
I am not letting that
maniac into this house.

01:11:08.012 --> 01:11:09.180
DeeDee here?

01:11:09.213 --> 01:11:11.016
DeeDee coming?

01:11:13.789 --> 01:11:16.094
I need to talk to you.

01:11:17.831 --> 01:11:20.068
Keep an eye on him.

01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:21.970
I got him.

01:11:25.043 --> 01:11:28.215
Have you seen enough?

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:31.054
Did this do it for you?

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:35.260
This is why we have to
put her away, Elaine.

01:11:35.296 --> 01:11:37.432
Yeah, sure, right.

01:11:37.466 --> 01:11:39.871
Put 'em all away.

01:11:39.904 --> 01:11:44.077
Put every little different
thing out of sight.

01:11:44.113 --> 01:11:47.019
Like you did
with your son.

01:11:49.488 --> 01:11:51.391
I'm going out.

01:11:56.868 --> 01:11:58.805
He was dying up there, Ed.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.344
The least you could've
done was watch.

01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:08.792
I watched.

01:12:10.161 --> 01:12:12.265
How could you miss it?

01:12:14.069 --> 01:12:16.073
Any of it?

01:12:41.219 --> 01:12:42.954
What are you gonna do?

01:12:44.391 --> 01:12:47.229
I really wish
you'd said we.

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:51.904
What are we gonna do?

01:12:54.109 --> 01:12:57.314
Go get, DeeDee, would you?

01:12:57.349 --> 01:12:59.953
I gotta take Willy back to
the assisted living center

01:12:59.987 --> 01:13:02.458
and he won't come with
me without your sister.

01:13:02.492 --> 01:13:03.961
Want me to come?

01:13:03.993 --> 01:13:06.364
No.

01:13:06.399 --> 01:13:09.938
Make sure your
father gets home.

01:13:09.972 --> 01:13:11.943
I will.

01:13:34.085 --> 01:13:36.956
Nobody should ever
lose their boy.

01:13:52.585 --> 01:13:53.953
Merry Christmas, guys.

01:13:53.988 --> 01:13:56.492
How's it going tonight?

01:13:58.896 --> 01:14:02.168
Willy, what do you want?

01:14:02.203 --> 01:14:03.905
Hamburger? Hotdog?

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.976
Yes.

01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:07.811
We'll have...

01:14:12.021 --> 01:14:13.356
Just give him a minute.

01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:14.458
Okay.

01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:16.296
Willy.

01:14:16.329 --> 01:14:17.966
Willy, honey.

01:14:17.998 --> 01:14:18.898
Willy.

01:14:18.934 --> 01:14:20.802
That's just his thing.

01:14:22.106 --> 01:14:24.978
You like to dance?

01:14:26.114 --> 01:14:27.884
Me too.

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:32.425
Hey, speaking of which we
are supposed to give these out.

01:14:40.073 --> 01:14:42.210
Willy won't make
it this year.

01:14:46.051 --> 01:14:47.219
I wish I could
sleep like that.

01:14:48.122 --> 01:14:49.490
Yeah.

01:14:49.524 --> 01:14:52.328
So we'll have...

01:14:52.363 --> 01:14:55.402
Two hamburgers,
two hot dogs...

01:14:55.435 --> 01:14:59.909
A large fry, a coke,
and a coffee for me.

01:14:59.944 --> 01:15:00.612
Thanks.

01:15:00.645 --> 01:15:01.746
Coffee.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.615
Great, I will put that in
and I can come right back

01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:05.587
with the coffee.

01:15:47.032 --> 01:15:49.537
I've never seen
you run before.

01:16:26.439 --> 01:16:29.077
Hell of a day?

01:16:32.617 --> 01:16:34.153
Willy.

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:38.694
Willy.

01:16:41.766 --> 01:16:47.978
DeeDee needs
love and care.

01:16:48.012 --> 01:16:49.014
Do you understand?

01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:51.182
Just one.

01:16:51.217 --> 01:16:52.085
No, no, no, honey!

01:16:52.119 --> 01:16:53.154
Honey.

01:16:53.188 --> 01:16:54.724
Let her sleep.

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:02.237
Because I'm thinking of letting
you spend more time with her.

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:03.405
DeeDee?

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.710
Yeah.

01:17:04.743 --> 01:17:06.980
DeeDee.

01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:12.358
Remember the night
he got that trophy?

01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:14.594
Yeah.

01:17:14.627 --> 01:17:18.100
Empire State awards.

01:17:18.135 --> 01:17:20.704
Every scout from
the east was there.

01:17:20.739 --> 01:17:23.711
Joe DiMaggio stopped
by our table.

01:17:23.744 --> 01:17:26.983
He said Kent had the best
swing on him that he'd

01:17:27.018 --> 01:17:30.189
seen in any kid from New
York in twenty years.

01:17:30.224 --> 01:17:33.163
He meant it, too.

01:17:33.197 --> 01:17:35.701
Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.

01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:38.472
The Yankee clipper.

01:17:41.445 --> 01:17:45.085
They'll never be
another Joe DiMaggio.

01:17:56.439 --> 01:18:02.116
If we let you be
around DeeDee,

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:08.594
you have to believe
in her special-ness.

01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:12.168
You understand?

01:18:14.104 --> 01:18:19.748
Part of that is having
respect for DeeDee.

01:18:21.219 --> 01:18:26.494
And that means not putting
your fingers in her.

01:18:27.198 --> 01:18:29.402
You understand?

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:39.385
But you have to
have respect.

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:40.521
Respect.

01:18:40.555 --> 01:18:42.792
Respect, Willy, yeah.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:48.737
You have to respect
for anything to work.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:50.071
DeeDee.

01:18:50.105 --> 01:18:51.474
Yeah.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.282
Yeah.

01:18:55.317 --> 01:18:57.219
DeeDee.

01:19:05.668 --> 01:19:07.438
I think I may
have killed him.

01:19:07.471 --> 01:19:09.340
What?

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.349
I gave him some pills.

01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:20.161
I didn't know he got
booted up at the hospital

01:19:20.195 --> 01:19:21.163
and I gave him some oxy.

01:19:21.198 --> 01:19:23.135
A lot of it.

01:19:24.436 --> 01:19:26.640
Jesus Christ.

01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:31.448
I said some awful
things to him.

01:19:32.386 --> 01:19:34.322
I got in an argument and I
said some not nice stuff

01:19:34.354 --> 01:19:35.623
that I shouldn't.

01:19:35.658 --> 01:19:38.262
You didn't kill him, Todd.

01:19:40.132 --> 01:19:43.438
He took care of
that on his own.

01:19:48.882 --> 01:19:52.588
You know what happened
with Kent in the Marines?

01:19:54.158 --> 01:19:55.826
He got injured.

01:19:55.862 --> 01:19:57.530
Yeah, but...

01:19:57.564 --> 01:19:59.266
He got sick.

01:19:59.301 --> 01:20:01.438
Something got him sick.

01:20:01.471 --> 01:20:04.576
The VA they're not
telling me anything.

01:20:04.612 --> 01:20:05.479
Tell you what?

01:20:05.512 --> 01:20:08.283
Why he didn't get a
military funeral.

01:20:08.319 --> 01:20:09.186
It don't make sense.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:10.723
Everybody gets one.

01:20:12.193 --> 01:20:13.594
Let it go, dad.

01:20:13.628 --> 01:20:15.231
Todd.

01:20:15.265 --> 01:20:19.774
If you know anything,
please tell me.

01:20:23.213 --> 01:20:24.448
He got kicked
out of the core.

01:20:24.481 --> 01:20:26.317
For what?

01:20:26.351 --> 01:20:27.753
I don't know.

01:20:27.787 --> 01:20:29.757
Well how do you know
he got drummed out?

01:20:29.792 --> 01:20:31.328
Because he told me.

01:20:31.362 --> 01:20:33.699
Told you what?

01:20:35.636 --> 01:20:38.207
That he got dishonorably
discharged.

01:20:39.243 --> 01:20:41.547
Damn liar!

01:20:43.283 --> 01:20:45.387
He's a decorated veteran.

01:20:46.323 --> 01:20:46.824
Okay.

01:20:46.856 --> 01:20:48.626
A bona fide hero.

01:20:48.659 --> 01:20:50.796
You can stop being
jealous of him.

01:20:50.832 --> 01:20:52.501
He's dead!

01:20:53.336 --> 01:20:54.739
Stop, dad.

01:20:55.974 --> 01:20:56.908
Stop.

01:20:56.943 --> 01:20:57.978
Just stop.

01:21:07.695 --> 01:21:11.737
You knew nothing
about, Kent.

01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:15.410
You didn't know a god
damn thing about him.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.752
You and your
fucking war stories.

01:21:19.784 --> 01:21:22.622
You put that
shit in his head.

01:21:26.332 --> 01:21:30.605
You wanna know why your son
got kicked out of the core?

01:21:30.639 --> 01:21:32.373
You wanna know?

01:21:32.408 --> 01:21:34.311
Answer me!

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.583
You don't wanna know.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.556
You don't.

01:21:44.297 --> 01:21:47.703
I never got a medal for
the Denang air raid.

01:21:48.907 --> 01:21:49.806
I know the story.

01:21:49.841 --> 01:21:51.778
No, you don't.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.884
I wasn't on the beach.

01:21:54.917 --> 01:21:58.656
I was on a nearby hill
attending radar and I was

01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:03.365
on the only one on duty and I
got shit faced and conked out.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:06.572
And the migs made it
through the radar and

01:22:06.605 --> 01:22:09.277
massacred my company.

01:22:11.914 --> 01:22:16.523
The only medal that I got
was the combat medal.

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:20.666
It means that you killed some
other poor son of a bitch.

01:22:22.301 --> 01:22:26.909
It's not a flashy
medal, it's humble.

01:22:26.944 --> 01:22:30.016
And it should be because
there's nothing more

01:22:30.048 --> 01:22:32.488
humbling than killing.

01:24:02.756 --> 01:24:04.726
Where is everybody?

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.930
Picking up Willy Crum.

01:24:06.962 --> 01:24:08.432
For what?

01:24:08.466 --> 01:24:10.770
Christmas dinner.

01:24:10.804 --> 01:24:13.841
I couldn't talk your
mother out of it.

01:24:13.877 --> 01:24:16.014
You gotta be kidding me.

01:24:16.046 --> 01:24:18.350
No, it's what she wants.

01:24:42.596 --> 01:24:45.000
What happened
to the piranhas?

01:24:45.033 --> 01:24:48.006
Turns out, they're
illegal to own.

01:24:49.475 --> 01:24:50.811
Who knew.

01:24:54.118 --> 01:24:57.157
These are angel fish.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.430
They're monogamous.

01:25:01.931 --> 01:25:05.905
They should live a long time
if they don't eat each other.

01:25:17.496 --> 01:25:21.636
I don't remember most of
last night so if I got a

01:25:21.668 --> 01:25:24.106
little Irish on you...

01:25:25.644 --> 01:25:27.881
Yeah, I was wrecked.

01:25:27.913 --> 01:25:30.451
Right.

01:25:30.485 --> 01:25:32.456
Right so...

01:25:32.488 --> 01:25:34.826
No need to mention
it to your mom.

01:25:34.859 --> 01:25:36.796
Any of it.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.403
Great.

01:25:43.777 --> 01:25:45.948
Great.

01:25:49.887 --> 01:25:51.457
-Just one.
-Not one.

01:25:51.490 --> 01:25:52.259
-Just one.
-Not one.

01:25:52.292 --> 01:25:53.225
Alright, you guys,
okay. Come on.

01:25:53.261 --> 01:25:54.898
That's enough.
Settle down.

01:25:54.931 --> 01:25:56.199
Come on.

01:25:57.103 --> 01:25:58.939
Let's all sit down.

01:26:06.185 --> 01:26:07.921
He's my boyfriend.

01:26:07.956 --> 01:26:08.823
We know, sweetie.

01:26:08.856 --> 01:26:09.689
I love him.

01:26:09.725 --> 01:26:11.461
He's funny alright.

01:26:11.496 --> 01:26:13.600
Yeah, he's a
laugh a minute.

01:26:19.911 --> 01:26:21.913
Ed.

01:26:21.948 --> 01:26:24.819
You wanna say a prayer.

01:26:24.854 --> 01:26:26.090
Sure.

01:26:33.136 --> 01:26:37.678
God, we thank you for this
food and we ask you to

01:26:37.711 --> 01:26:40.748
take really good
care of Kent.

01:26:40.783 --> 01:26:42.519
Amen.

01:26:42.552 --> 01:26:44.722
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:26:44.757 --> 01:26:46.527
Okay.

01:26:47.296 --> 01:26:49.065
Alright.

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:52.806
Looks amazing, mom.

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.877
There you go, Willy.

01:27:05.796 --> 01:27:07.531
Not one.

01:27:07.565 --> 01:27:08.201
Just one.

01:27:08.234 --> 01:27:08.835
-Not one.
-Just one.

01:27:08.869 --> 01:27:11.673
Hey, none of that, DeeDee.

01:27:11.707 --> 01:27:12.742
-Not one.
-Just one.

01:27:12.777 --> 01:27:14.980
I mean it, both of you.

01:27:15.014 --> 01:27:17.217
Willy, you wanna go back
to the center or you wanna

01:27:17.251 --> 01:27:20.088
stay here for dinner?

01:27:20.824 --> 01:27:21.826
Just one.

01:27:21.859 --> 01:27:23.762
Not one.

01:27:23.796 --> 01:27:24.831
Not one.

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:30.006
Okay, you can whisper,
but just once in a while.

01:27:30.042 --> 01:27:31.077
He's my boyfriend.

01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:32.278
He's cute.

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:33.949
That's for certain.

01:27:33.981 --> 01:27:35.216
Yes, baby.

01:27:35.252 --> 01:27:36.755
I love him, you know.

01:27:36.787 --> 01:27:38.156
I know, sweetheart.

01:27:38.190 --> 01:27:39.827
You better.

01:27:39.859 --> 01:27:41.762
Thanks for the warning.

01:27:45.002 --> 01:27:47.139
Come on, dude...

01:27:47.173 --> 01:27:48.676
-Willy.
-Willy.

01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:49.677
For god's sakes.

01:27:49.712 --> 01:27:52.049
Come on, mom, we're in
the middle of eating.

01:27:52.082 --> 01:27:55.855
Willy Crum put
his finger in me.

01:28:07.177 --> 01:28:10.650
His finger is in you?

01:28:18.733 --> 01:28:21.704
You see, Ed, there's worse
things than being fingered.

01:28:26.012 --> 01:28:29.987
The Christmas dance,
we going or what?

01:28:47.284 --> 01:28:49.288
Hey, hold on there, champ.

01:28:51.327 --> 01:28:53.128
Going to dance?

01:28:53.163 --> 01:28:56.603
Yeah, DeeDee, we're going
to the god damn dance.

01:29:57.117 --> 01:29:57.918
I'll get the tickets.

01:29:57.951 --> 01:29:58.417
Okay.

01:29:58.452 --> 01:29:59.686
Mrs. Kendall.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.290
They're not
allowed in here.

01:30:01.323 --> 01:30:03.159
What the hell is going on?

01:30:03.194 --> 01:30:06.365
Mr. Kendall, it was made
clear to your wife that

01:30:06.399 --> 01:30:09.737
DeeDee is no longer
welcome at the box factory.

01:30:09.773 --> 01:30:12.342
There won't be a problem
tonight, I promise.

01:30:12.377 --> 01:30:14.213
How can you promise that?

01:30:14.247 --> 01:30:17.286
Hey, let me make
you a promise.

01:30:17.319 --> 01:30:19.956
You don't let my family
into this dance, you're

01:30:19.992 --> 01:30:23.765
gonna need a lot more than
a fucking neck brace.

01:30:23.798 --> 01:30:25.368
Please escort the Kendall's
off the premises.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:26.903
I don't want a scene here.

01:30:26.938 --> 01:30:28.373
It's too late for that.

01:30:28.407 --> 01:30:29.775
Hey! Hey!

01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:30.344
Don't touch him.

01:30:30.377 --> 01:30:31.947
Don't touch my father.

01:30:33.384 --> 01:30:34.953
-Let go of me.
-Alright.

01:30:34.987 --> 01:30:35.954
Stop.

01:30:35.988 --> 01:30:36.589
Stop.

01:30:36.623 --> 01:30:38.726
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.801
Ed, look.

01:30:43.837 --> 01:30:45.239
Look.

01:31:13.324 --> 01:31:14.927
Forget it.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:17.733
You okay, son.

01:31:19.537 --> 01:31:20.305
Yeah, are you?

01:31:20.337 --> 01:31:22.072
Yeah, I'm good.

01:31:42.045 --> 01:31:44.483
I don't know
what I'm seeing.

01:31:44.516 --> 01:31:47.488
You're seeing the same
thing I'm seeing.

01:31:48.323 --> 01:31:52.128
They calm each other down just
like any two people in love.

01:31:56.605 --> 01:31:58.208
Hi.

01:31:58.242 --> 01:31:59.944
Hi.

01:32:12.903 --> 01:32:15.206
What's your name?

01:32:15.238 --> 01:32:18.811
This is Annie.

01:32:18.846 --> 01:32:20.349
Hi, Annie.
I'm Todd.

01:32:20.382 --> 01:32:21.784
Hi.

01:32:23.255 --> 01:32:25.326
This is my daughter.

01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:33.240
That's my family.

01:32:36.246 --> 01:32:38.114
Do you like rabbits?

01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:46.029
Actually, I have a rabbit.

01:32:51.173 --> 01:32:53.042
Do you wanna dance?

01:32:54.112 --> 01:32:55.948
We do.

01:32:55.983 --> 01:32:57.885
Do you wanna?

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.891
Yeah? Let's do it.

01:33:00.925 --> 01:33:04.364
Alright, you gotta lead
though because I'm terrible.

01:33:07.203 --> 01:33:09.038
We'll keep DeeDee home.

01:33:09.073 --> 01:33:12.012
We'll find a way to pay
for her meds, alright?

01:33:12.046 --> 01:33:15.252
I didn't give her
any meds today.

01:33:15.286 --> 01:33:17.922
She should be
jumping out windows.

01:33:17.957 --> 01:33:20.128
But she's not.

01:33:29.444 --> 01:33:32.081
Come on.

01:33:32.115 --> 01:33:33.251
Where we going?

01:33:33.284 --> 01:33:35.488
I'm gonna dance
with my wife.

01:33:35.523 --> 01:33:37.192
Come on.

01:33:56.529 --> 01:33:59.300
I admire you, Elaine.

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:02.239
It's like more
than anything else.
