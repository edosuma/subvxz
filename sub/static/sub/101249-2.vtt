08:44.318 --> 08:45.493
Okay, snippy.

08:45.537 --> 08:47.234
Ooh, yeah, I'm snippy.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.497
Drinking, landing
in an unsecured district?

08:49.541 --> 08:51.368
That's how you choose
to represent Starfleet?

08:51.412 --> 08:52.805
Me and the general
are blood-bonded.

08:52.848 --> 08:54.589
It would have been weird
if I acted all stuffy.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.678
He's passed out
and he pooped on his sword.

08:56.722 --> 08:58.419
He's a lightweight.
I mean, don't sweat it.

08:58.462 --> 09:00.073
We'll get him a hot cup
of raktajino,

09:00.116 --> 09:01.901
-he will be ready to go.
-Oh, no.

09:01.944 --> 09:03.206
-Oh...
-Oh, no!

09:03.250 --> 09:05.382
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:05.426 --> 09:06.775
The shuttle! The shuttle!
What the hell?!

09:06.819 --> 09:09.386
-No.
-Ha. Classic K'orin.

09:09.430 --> 09:11.780
Ah, he did this on Vulcan.
And on Earth.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.434
He steals a lot of things.

09:13.477 --> 09:15.958
We are stranded here
because of your recklessness.

09:16.002 --> 09:18.265
Oh, relax. We can just beam
back to the Cerritos

09:18.308 --> 09:20.093
and remotely trigger
the return autopilot.

09:20.136 --> 09:21.355
[device beeping]

09:21.398 --> 09:23.487
Sure, yeah, if Tulgana 4
wasn't protected

09:23.531 --> 09:27.274
by an ion field that restricts
comms and transporters!

09:27.317 --> 09:28.884
Do you even read
the mission brief?

09:28.928 --> 09:30.712
I'm sorry,
I skimmed almost most of it

09:30.756 --> 09:32.540
and read some
of the captions, so...

09:32.584 --> 09:34.281
[groans, panting]

09:34.324 --> 09:36.675
-Dude, where are you going?-I'm tracking down our shuttle.

09:36.718 --> 09:38.677
If we're not back to it
by the next rotation,

09:38.720 --> 09:40.679
-we'll be court-martialed!
-Don't knock it
till you've tried it.

09:40.722 --> 09:43.377
This is serious! I think we'reviolating the Khitomer Accords!

09:43.420 --> 09:45.379
Yeah, I don't want to go
to a penal colony either,

09:45.422 --> 09:46.902
but I am not going
to speed-walk.

09:46.946 --> 09:48.643
What is this speed-walking?

09:48.687 --> 09:50.253
-You know we're going
the same speed.
-Stop it.

09:50.297 --> 09:52.255
It's to conserve energy.
Section 31 does this.

09:56.433 --> 09:58.784
Yes, General K'orin
was here a short while ago.

09:58.827 --> 10:02.831
It was my honor to serve him
a warrior's meal.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.181
[grunts, clears throat]
Do you know where he went?

10:05.225 --> 10:07.183
-Are you tracking him?
-Oh, well, I, uh...

10:07.227 --> 10:08.620
Whew, I think, uh...

10:08.663 --> 10:11.057
Uh, no, we-we want
to kneel before him

10:11.100 --> 10:14.234
and lick his boots like
the Federation dogs we are.

10:14.277 --> 10:16.932
He went north,
in search of stronger ale.

10:16.976 --> 10:19.935
-He was already wasted.
-[grunts] Is that a problem?

10:19.979 --> 10:23.330
Uh, no. I mean, uh,
drinking to excess is cool.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.548
All right, come on.
There's an Andorian district

10:24.592 --> 10:25.637
just north of here.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.900
So we're Federation dogs, huh?

10:27.943 --> 10:29.510
Hey, if it got us
what we needed, woof woof.

10:29.553 --> 10:31.468
I know this is fun,but we really need to get back.

10:31.512 --> 10:32.687
I'm not having fun.

10:32.731 --> 10:34.036
MARINER:
Geez, these guys are acting

10:34.080 --> 10:36.038
like they've never seen
a Starfleet uniform.

10:36.082 --> 10:37.518
Well, they're Kaelons,

10:37.561 --> 10:39.389
and Kaelons are
notoriously isolationist.

10:39.433 --> 10:41.391
And that...
[grunts]

10:41.435 --> 10:43.916
-[roars]
-Oh, shoot, sorry.
That's my fault.

10:43.959 --> 10:45.961
Boimler, let's keep moving.

10:46.005 --> 10:48.137
No, no, no, I need to apologizein his native tongue.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.096
Let me think.
He's a, uh, a Taxor.

10:50.139 --> 10:53.099
Right, and they communicate
through guttural tones.

10:56.102 --> 10:57.190
[roars]

10:57.233 --> 10:58.365
[shouts, whimpers]

10:58.408 --> 11:00.149
Hey back off, blue!

11:00.193 --> 11:01.498
No! Don't hit him!
We have a treaty!

11:01.542 --> 11:03.936
[sighs, grunts]

11:06.678 --> 11:07.853
[grunts, panting]

11:11.900 --> 11:13.510
RANSOM:
You made the right choice

11:13.554 --> 11:15.121
transferring into Command, son.

11:15.164 --> 11:16.513
Nothing compares to the firm,

11:16.557 --> 11:18.472
hot pulse of a joystick
in your hand.

11:18.515 --> 11:20.604
The bridge is
where the action is.

11:20.648 --> 11:21.954
Should be interesting, sir.

11:21.997 --> 11:23.912
Let's start with
a classic bridge simulation.

11:23.956 --> 11:25.740
Computer, Command Trainer 43.

11:25.784 --> 11:28.961
COMPUTER: Initiating advanced simulation.

11:29.004 --> 11:30.832
Ensign, the bridge is yours.

11:30.876 --> 11:33.748
Be gentle but attentive.
Get her where she needs to be.

11:33.792 --> 11:36.751
-Guide her home.
-Okeydokey. [chuckles]

11:36.795 --> 11:39.406
Uh, maintain course.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.060
-[all screaming]
-[alarm blaring]

11:41.103 --> 11:43.236
Captain, we're being drawn
into a temporal rift.

11:43.279 --> 11:45.064
-Uh... Uh...
-Shields at ten percent!

11:45.107 --> 11:47.457
-Warp core breach
in 30 seconds, Captain!
-Oh, man.

11:47.501 --> 11:48.763
Captain, we need orders!

11:48.807 --> 11:52.549
Uh, uh... maintain course?

11:52.593 --> 11:54.160
COMPUTER:
Ship destroyed.

11:54.203 --> 11:56.075
Casualties: 105%

11:56.118 --> 11:58.294
Wait. How did I kill
more than the whole crew?

11:58.338 --> 12:00.122
Okay, that was a rough start.

12:00.166 --> 12:01.776
FYI, in situations like that,

12:01.820 --> 12:04.126
try employing
the Janeway Protocol.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.128
Got it. And what's that?

12:06.172 --> 12:07.913
[laughs]
Good one.

12:07.956 --> 12:09.305
All right, let's try something
more straightforward.

12:09.349 --> 12:11.307
Computer, Command Trainer 4.

12:11.351 --> 12:15.137
COMPUTER:
Initiating basic training
simulation.

12:15.181 --> 12:18.140
Captain, we're directlyin the path of a small asteroid.

12:18.184 --> 12:19.446
Should we move to avoid?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.448
Uh, do the Janeway Protocol.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.667
Uh, are you sure, sir?

12:23.711 --> 12:25.539
-Yes?
-[thudding]
-[all screaming]

12:25.582 --> 12:26.801
-Collision alert, sir.
-[alarm blaring]

12:26.845 --> 12:28.977
The kindergarten on Deck Eight,it's gone!

12:29.021 --> 12:30.892
-Uh, uh...
-[thudding]

12:30.936 --> 12:32.024
SIMULATED ENSIGN:
No.

12:32.067 --> 12:34.026
No, no, no.
Now the pre-K is gone.

12:34.069 --> 12:36.942
All the ship's children
have been ejected into space.

12:36.985 --> 12:38.944
-All those kids...
-RANSOM: Freeze program.

12:38.987 --> 12:40.728
In thousands of simulations,

12:40.772 --> 12:43.078
that's literally
never happened before.

12:43.122 --> 12:46.342
Let's try another one, on a shipwith even more children.

12:49.563 --> 12:51.913
I can't believe I messed up
so bad with that Taxor.

12:51.957 --> 12:53.915
I've read, like,
five books about them.

12:53.959 --> 12:55.656
Hey, don't sweat it, B.
I got you.

12:55.699 --> 12:57.440
That's even worse.
You didn't study them at all.

12:57.484 --> 12:58.833
I study by doing, you know?

12:58.877 --> 13:00.835
Maybe you need to spend
less time in the library

13:00.879 --> 13:02.402
and more time
letting Boimler get nasty.

13:02.445 --> 13:03.838
No. I need to up my studying,

13:03.882 --> 13:05.361
spend even more time
in the library.

13:05.405 --> 13:07.233
Whatever, man.
Just hang here for a second.

13:07.276 --> 13:09.061
I got to go blood-pee
some blood wine,

13:09.104 --> 13:11.803
maybe get some intel
on the general.

13:11.846 --> 13:15.067
Oh. I see we both have
a thing for red.

13:15.110 --> 13:17.069
-Uh, me, what, red? What?
-Your shirt.

13:17.112 --> 13:18.853
-We match.
-Oh.

13:18.897 --> 13:21.551
Uh, yes, well,
this is my work shirt.

13:21.595 --> 13:24.380
-And I'm Ensign...
-Ensign Brad Boimler. I know.

13:24.424 --> 13:28.210
I can sense your thoughts,
your desires.

13:28.254 --> 13:30.560
[whispers]:
I know you like jamaharon.

13:30.604 --> 13:32.171
[stammers]

13:32.214 --> 13:34.173
Mm...
[laughs softly]

13:36.479 --> 13:37.741
[both screaming]

13:37.785 --> 13:39.134
Mariner, what the hell?!

13:39.178 --> 13:40.657
That thing is an Anabaj.

13:40.701 --> 13:42.834
It's gonna implant eggs
in your throat, dummy.

13:42.877 --> 13:44.879
-What are you... [shouts]
-[hissing]

13:44.923 --> 13:47.795
I know you still want it.

13:47.839 --> 13:49.623
I can hear
your nasty boy thoughts.

13:49.666 --> 13:52.147
Jamaharon.
This boy wants jamaharon!

13:52.191 --> 13:53.409
[screams]

13:54.584 --> 13:55.890
Love your sarong.

13:55.934 --> 13:57.196
-You okay, Boims?
-Yeah, I just...

13:57.239 --> 13:58.632
I-I've never even
heard of an Anabaj.

13:58.675 --> 14:00.112
How did you know?

14:00.155 --> 14:01.896
Affinity for red,
drawn to the weak-minded.

14:01.940 --> 14:04.768
Plus, I kind of dated one once,but only to make my mom mad.

14:04.812 --> 14:06.118
Weak-minded?
[shouts]

14:06.161 --> 14:07.336
An Andorian in the bathroom
said the general's

14:07.380 --> 14:09.121
at a bar just down the road.
Come on.

14:09.164 --> 14:10.862
You can tell me
about jamaharonlater.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.647
Ah, you're doing a bang-up job

14:13.690 --> 14:14.953
with that endocrine system,
Ensign.

14:14.996 --> 14:16.476
It's not so different
from engineering.

14:16.519 --> 14:18.217
The heart's an engine.
The brain's a computer.

14:18.260 --> 14:20.610
The eyes are a different kind
of computer. No-- cameras.

14:20.654 --> 14:21.916
-Eyes are cameras. Camera eyes.-Sure.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.483
Whatever you need
to tell yourself.

14:23.526 --> 14:25.920
The next part gets dicey.
Keep him distracted.

14:25.964 --> 14:28.227
-Are you sure you don't
want me to reroute...
-Go chat him up!

14:28.270 --> 14:31.360
That's an order!
Tendi, exoscalpel.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.668
Uh, hi. I'm supposed todistract you from all this stuff

14:34.711 --> 14:36.713
-over here, so...
-I'm gonna be okay,
though, right?

14:36.757 --> 14:38.933
My implant says there'sonly a small chance you'll die.

14:38.977 --> 14:40.935
-What? How small?
-18%. Oh, uh...

14:40.979 --> 14:43.242
Now it's up to 20. You mightwant to control that heart rate.

14:43.285 --> 14:44.373
-Oh, God, I'm gonna die!
-[rapid beeping]

14:44.417 --> 14:45.766
What the hell
are you saying to him?

14:45.809 --> 14:47.594
-Just calm him down.
-Uh, uh...

14:47.637 --> 14:49.378
Take your mind off of this.
Uh, think about work.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.990
-Think about the warp core.-I got burned in the warp core!

14:52.033 --> 14:54.296
Those are dilithium burns?
How are you still alive, man?

14:54.340 --> 14:55.515
You should be dead!

14:55.558 --> 14:57.952
Get out of here!
Tendi, take over.

14:57.996 --> 14:59.736
-Wait, but...
-[whispers]: Sorry.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.217
Don't worry, you're looking
just fine, inside and out.

15:02.261 --> 15:05.394
Oh, my God. Oh, thank God.
That robot said I was dying.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.006
Listen, kid, you're great
at digging around in a body,

15:08.049 --> 15:10.008
but if you can't muster up
some bedside manner,

15:10.051 --> 15:12.749
you may as well be
with the grunts in security.

15:12.793 --> 15:14.403
Welcome to security.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.884
Why don't we throw you into
the fire and see if you burn?

15:16.928 --> 15:20.888
Computer, initiate
Combat Simulation Smorgasborg.

15:20.932 --> 15:22.150
COMPUTER:
Initiating.

15:22.194 --> 15:23.717
[shouts]
Borg!

15:23.760 --> 15:25.284
Oh, crap.
I don't know how to fight.

15:25.327 --> 15:28.504
I don't know how to fight.
Maybe this thing does?

15:30.245 --> 15:32.247
[laughs]:
O-Okay.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.815
[grunting]
Oh, I can do that?

15:36.077 --> 15:38.471
Ha, man. Ha!

15:38.514 --> 15:40.603
[grunts]
Take that. Chop, chop, bang!

15:42.866 --> 15:44.564
Karate! Ha, ha.

15:49.308 --> 15:51.092
In the name of the Prophets.

15:51.136 --> 15:53.268
I-I put people
into that simulation

15:53.312 --> 15:55.444
so they can learn
how to deal with defeat.

15:55.488 --> 15:59.100
Ensign, you are
a natural-born warrior.

15:59.144 --> 16:00.710
Oh. Okeydokey.

16:00.754 --> 16:04.584
Keep your head down.
Andorians don't mess around.

16:04.627 --> 16:06.542
Um, Andorians were a founding
member of the Federation.

16:06.586 --> 16:09.371
Please don't explain them to me.I can look out for myself.

16:09.415 --> 16:11.025
You want to tell me
about Tellarites, too?

16:11.069 --> 16:12.853
Maybe shut up and keep
an eye out for the shuttle?

16:12.896 --> 16:13.941
-How about that?
-[shouts]

16:13.985 --> 16:16.813
No, you're hurting me. Please.

16:16.857 --> 16:18.641
[grunts]
My bones.

16:18.685 --> 16:20.730
-[shouts] They're killing him!
-[gasps] Boimler!

16:20.774 --> 16:22.732
Please, no. I-I can explain.

16:22.776 --> 16:24.473
Explain it to my boot.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.127
-[laser zaps]
-[grunts]

16:26.171 --> 16:28.129
Starfleet! I order you
to step away from the elder.

16:28.173 --> 16:30.175
You idiot!
That's no elder, it's...

16:30.218 --> 16:33.047
-[laughs] Now I'm a little boy.-[Boimler groans]

16:33.091 --> 16:34.875
A shapeshifter? Ah, boo.

16:34.918 --> 16:37.573
That Vendorian is a thief,
and you let him get away!

16:37.617 --> 16:40.359
They must be working together!
[grunts]

16:42.100 --> 16:43.884

[grunting]

16:46.974 --> 16:48.323
Oh, no! Aah!

16:52.632 --> 16:56.027
Stand down. This is in violationof the Tulganan Neutrality Pact.

16:56.070 --> 16:58.420
[grunts, screams]

16:59.508 --> 17:00.509
[screams]

17:06.298 --> 17:08.300
-[Boimler shouting]
-Kirk hands!

17:09.605 --> 17:11.564
Hello, alien people.

17:11.607 --> 17:13.044
Alien creatures and beings.

17:13.087 --> 17:14.741
Look up here. Thank you. Okay.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.091
I would be happy to hand you
all your asses, but right now,

17:17.135 --> 17:19.485
we're kind of on a deadline, sohow about instead of fighting,

17:19.528 --> 17:21.313
the next five rounds are on me?

17:21.356 --> 17:23.880
[all cheering]

17:25.143 --> 17:27.275
It's cool. I stole it
from that Taxor!

17:27.319 --> 17:29.495
[grunts] Excuse me, sir.
I don't know you.

17:29.538 --> 17:31.714
That is Starfleet property
you're handling.

17:34.195 --> 17:35.675
[groans]

17:35.718 --> 17:37.459
Ah, apparently,
we just missed K'orin.

17:37.503 --> 17:39.331
-If we hurry,
maybe we can get him.
-[sighs]

17:39.374 --> 17:41.115
-I don't even care anymore.
-What?

17:41.159 --> 17:43.422
-Oh, man, how much blood
did you lose?
-Ow. [sighs]

17:43.465 --> 17:45.250
This whole time, I've either
been one step behind you

17:45.293 --> 17:47.774
-or totally in the dark.
-Yeah, but only because
I'm pretty amazing.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.645
[sighs] Look,
everyone has bad days.

17:49.689 --> 17:51.343
All that studying,
and where did it get me?

17:51.386 --> 17:52.735
Klingon threw a knife
at my head.

17:52.779 --> 17:54.346
I nearly got eggs
laid in my throat.

17:54.389 --> 17:56.739
Those guys at the bar
wanted to eat me.

17:56.783 --> 17:58.045
What is that?
What are you doing?

17:58.089 --> 17:59.873
Kitalia leaves--
they contain a numbing agent.

17:59.916 --> 18:02.354
I've never once seen you study,but then you just

18:02.397 --> 18:04.443
breeze in here
knowing cool plant tricks

18:04.486 --> 18:06.009
and which aliens
are which-- how?

18:06.053 --> 18:07.359
Dude, I told you
I've been places.

18:07.402 --> 18:08.925
I just pick stuff up
along the way.

18:08.969 --> 18:10.231
I could never do that.

18:10.275 --> 18:12.190
I guess I'm just not cut out
for Starfleet.

18:12.233 --> 18:13.626
Oh, please,
you're Mr. Starfleet.

18:13.669 --> 18:15.106
No, I'm not, not like you are!

18:15.149 --> 18:17.151
I should just turn in
my uniform and go

18:17.195 --> 18:19.197
-work on a research asteroid!
-[gasps]

18:19.240 --> 18:21.764
No, absolutely not.
Do not even joke about that.

18:21.808 --> 18:23.201
That is the lamest thing
you could do.

18:23.244 --> 18:25.464
[crying]: I should just
study bugs on a far-off planet

18:25.507 --> 18:28.815
and then eventually get eaten
and no one will even know

18:28.858 --> 18:30.730
until they stumble
across my distress call,

18:30.773 --> 18:32.166
but it'll be way too late,

18:32.210 --> 18:33.733
and then they'll have to spend
a bunch of time

18:33.776 --> 18:35.213
deciphering
how things went wrong

18:35.256 --> 18:37.432
based on my final
shaky video logs.

18:37.476 --> 18:40.174
I'm sure you wouldn't get eaten.

18:40.218 --> 18:43.177
Starfleet doesn't just need
badass cool people like me.

18:43.221 --> 18:45.527
They need, like, book-smart
people like you, too.

18:45.571 --> 18:48.182
When we get back, I'm done.

18:48.226 --> 18:49.575
[grunts]

18:52.839 --> 18:54.884
All right, everyone, huddle up.

18:54.928 --> 18:58.714
I want to introduce you to the
newest bear in our bear pack.

18:58.758 --> 19:01.108
Rutherford's blood runs
yellow and black.

19:01.152 --> 19:02.979
He's one of us.

19:03.023 --> 19:05.373
Security isn't like
the other departments.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.897
[voice fading]:
No, it's a higher calling.

19:07.941 --> 19:10.552
We stand shoulder to shoulder,
holding the line

19:10.596 --> 19:13.207
against dangers
known and unknown.

19:13.251 --> 19:14.774
[regular volume]:
No greater honor

19:14.817 --> 19:16.645
than to die
beside you in battle.

19:16.689 --> 19:20.127
Yes, Rutherford, you're
never going to have to see

19:20.171 --> 19:22.521
the inside
of a Jefferies tube again.

19:22.564 --> 19:23.783
Thank you, sir.

19:23.826 --> 19:26.525
This all sounds fun
but not for me.

19:26.568 --> 19:27.961
-[all gasp]
-What?

19:28.004 --> 19:29.223
My heart's in engineering.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.225
I'd like permission
to leave the bear pack.

19:31.269 --> 19:33.314
Rutherford, that is...

19:33.358 --> 19:34.533
outstanding!

19:34.576 --> 19:35.838
Got to be true to yourself!

19:35.882 --> 19:37.231
-Am I right, bears?
-[all cheering]

19:37.275 --> 19:39.842
-Hoorah!
-Aw, bears.

19:41.366 --> 19:42.323
Come on, we got to take
a shortcut.

19:42.367 --> 19:43.324
We're almost out of time.

19:43.368 --> 19:44.412
Whatever. Who cares?

19:44.456 --> 19:45.544
I clearly do.

19:45.587 --> 19:47.328
Greetings, "hyoo-mons."

19:47.372 --> 19:49.635
I noticed you are injured.

19:49.678 --> 19:52.507
Perhaps I could
provide you transport.

19:52.551 --> 19:54.074
Uh, no, thank you, sir.

19:54.117 --> 19:55.510
[quietly]: Yeah, right.
Can you believe this guy?

19:55.554 --> 19:56.685
Actually, yeah,
that would be great.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.252
-We're kind of in a hurry.
-Wait, what?

19:58.296 --> 20:01.081
Excellent. My shuttle is
just beyond that ridge.

20:01.124 --> 20:03.431
Come, come.

20:03.475 --> 20:05.259
What are you doing?
We can't trust a Ferengi.

20:05.303 --> 20:07.218
-What? He's not a Ferengi.
-Yes, he is!

20:07.261 --> 20:09.176
-No, I think he's a Bolian.
-Oh, my God!

20:09.220 --> 20:12.092
He could not be more Ferengi--
the big ears, the beady eyes,

20:12.135 --> 20:13.267
that greedy thing they do
with their hands.

20:13.311 --> 20:15.138
"Hyoo-mon."

20:15.182 --> 20:16.705
-Myah.
-Ferengi are

20:16.749 --> 20:18.403
the most untrustworthy race
in the galaxy.

20:18.446 --> 20:20.709
He probably just wants to lureus over there so he can mug us.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.015
Look, we need a ride now,

20:22.058 --> 20:23.669
and my gut is telling me
this is fine.

20:23.712 --> 20:25.845
Need I remind you
that you've been wrong

20:25.888 --> 20:27.455
about literally
everything today?

20:27.499 --> 20:28.848
Not this.

20:28.891 --> 20:30.284
Uh-huh, sure. Okay, buddy.

20:30.328 --> 20:31.807
-Let's go.
-Good, good.

20:31.851 --> 20:34.332
-Follow me right this...
-What's your landing code?

20:34.375 --> 20:35.550
Uh, what?

20:35.594 --> 20:37.291
Tulganan security requires
all shuttlecraft

20:37.335 --> 20:39.075
to provide
a secure landing code.

20:39.119 --> 20:41.469
If you really have a shuttle
here, you must have a code.

20:41.513 --> 20:43.036
Oh, my code, yes.

20:43.079 --> 20:45.299
It's, uh, right... here!

20:45.343 --> 20:46.953
-Give me your profit!
-Oh!

20:46.996 --> 20:48.302
[grunts]

20:48.346 --> 20:50.435
Aah! Starfleet!

20:50.478 --> 20:51.740
Hey, Ferengi,
get-get out of here!

20:51.784 --> 20:52.959
Get! Get!

20:53.002 --> 20:55.309
Okay, maybe you were right.
That, uh...

20:55.353 --> 20:56.919
that seems like that
might've been a Ferengi.

20:56.963 --> 20:59.792
I was soright, yes!
[grunts, gasps]

20:59.835 --> 21:02.055
Holy crap, it's the shuttle.
It's the shuttle!

21:03.056 --> 21:04.927
-Bye-bye.
-Isn't that illegal?

21:04.971 --> 21:06.842
What are they gonna do,
send me a bill in space?

21:06.886 --> 21:08.888
Fair enough. If we gun it, we
can just make it back in time.

21:08.931 --> 21:11.369
-[snoring]
-Oh, man, he drank everything!

21:11.412 --> 21:12.761
-What do we do?
-Grab a leg.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.328
Let's drag him outand leave him by the front door,

21:14.372 --> 21:16.112
unless you don't think
that's Starfleet enough.

21:16.156 --> 21:17.766
It isn't, but let's do it.

21:20.726 --> 21:22.336
K'ORIN:
I demand

21:22.380 --> 21:24.295
you give me an honorable...

21:24.338 --> 21:26.166
[retches]

21:26.209 --> 21:28.429
[sighs]
Someone contact the Cerritos,

21:28.473 --> 21:30.213
tell them
we finally found K'orin.

21:30.257 --> 21:32.520
He is just in time
for the peace accords.

21:32.564 --> 21:34.827
Fetch me my drinking horn.
I need ale.

21:34.870 --> 21:37.308
Are you [bleep] kidding me?
No! Stop that.

21:40.441 --> 21:41.877
Whew, what a day!

21:41.921 --> 21:44.227
Man, that escort missionkind of went off the rails, huh?

21:44.271 --> 21:46.012
Sure did.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.971
Can't believe I didn't realizethat was a Ferengi in the park.

21:49.015 --> 21:50.364
[laughs, sighs]

21:50.408 --> 21:52.453
Hey, uh, so do you think maybe,

21:52.497 --> 21:54.760
maybe, fun idea, we could
just keep it between us?

21:54.803 --> 21:56.544
For sure.
We're in a circle of trust.

21:56.588 --> 21:58.764
This is a shuttle of silence.

21:58.807 --> 22:00.766
-[laughter]
-So the Ferengi's right there,

22:00.809 --> 22:02.724
and I'm like, "Mariner,
we can't trust this guy.

22:02.768 --> 22:04.770
He's a Ferengi." And then
she says, she says, get this,

22:04.813 --> 22:07.163
she says,
"Oh, no, that's a Bolian."

22:07.207 --> 22:09.383
[laughter]

22:09.427 --> 22:11.385
-Bolian!
-Okay, okay.

22:11.429 --> 22:12.995
Yep, yep, all right.

22:13.039 --> 22:15.302
After this long day
of being a badass,

22:15.346 --> 22:17.130
Captain Know-It-All over here
doesn't even know

22:17.173 --> 22:19.306
-what a Ferengi was.
-It wasn't as clear as that.

22:19.350 --> 22:21.961
[impersonating Ferengi]:
"Myah, myah, hyoo-mon!"

22:22.004 --> 22:23.832
He was doing the hand thing
and everything.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.181
All right, yeah,
no, that's my cue

22:25.225 --> 22:27.314
to go just launch myself
out an air lock.

22:27.358 --> 22:29.098
You guys have a great night.

22:29.142 --> 22:31.100
Lucky I was there!
I spotted it. I called it.

22:31.144 --> 22:33.146
-I called it.
-[laughter]

22:34.887 --> 22:36.105
Tendi, I'm sorry.

22:36.149 --> 22:37.759
I tried to make it work
in another division.

22:37.803 --> 22:40.109
I just couldn't do it.
I belong in the tubes.

22:40.153 --> 22:42.808
-I'm not gonna be able
to watch the pulsar with you.
-All right, whatever.

22:42.851 --> 22:44.505
I'll just watch it
in there with you on my PADD.

22:44.549 --> 22:45.898
Wait, you can?
We don't have to go

22:45.941 --> 22:47.334
to the observation deck
or anything?

22:47.378 --> 22:48.901
Nah, I just wanted company.
[laughs]

22:48.944 --> 22:51.338
I mean, it's not like you were
trying all those new jobs

22:51.382 --> 22:52.644
just to hang with me, right?

22:52.687 --> 22:55.298
[laughing]
No, yeah, no.

22:55.342 --> 22:57.039
Could you imagine?

22:59.085 --> 23:00.391
[tablet beeping]

23:00.434 --> 23:03.481
Ah, Mariner, was I
convincing enough for you,

23:03.524 --> 23:05.787
"hyoo-mon"? [laughs]

23:05.831 --> 23:08.094
You were perfect, Quimp.
Thanks for helping out.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.530
Of course. I owed you one.

23:09.574 --> 23:11.314
-How's the wife?
-She's good.

23:11.358 --> 23:13.926
We're actually looking to
get away to Risa this weekend.

23:13.969 --> 23:15.971
What? Ah, jealous.

23:16.015 --> 23:19.061
Oh, you know what you guys
should try? Jamaharon.

23:21.107 --> 23:22.151
Wow.

23:22.195 --> 23:23.718
Isn't it amazing?

23:23.762 --> 23:24.763
[sighs]

23:24.806 --> 23:27.156
It's beautiful.
