WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:04.091
.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.180
- Okay, everyone,
let's try some big smiles

00:07.007 --> 00:07.703
on this one, all right?

00:09.052 --> 00:09.705
Big smiles, everyone.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.534
Dina, would you like
to smile for this one?

00:12.577 --> 00:14.405
- No.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.668
- Dina, please.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.409
- Smiling would insinuate
that I support

00:18.453 --> 00:20.846
what's happening right now,
which I truly do not.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.240
- Oh, so documenting
the way our child

00:23.284 --> 00:24.763
is coming into
this world is wrong?

00:24.807 --> 00:26.374
- We have to document it

00:26.417 --> 00:28.158
by dressing up
as Alvin and the Chipmunks?

00:28.202 --> 00:31.161
- It's my favorite show,
and Glenn is such a Theodore.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.684
- Yeah, I'm not a star.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.382
I'm more supportive,
and, of course,

00:34.425 --> 00:36.340
Jerusha is such a Simon.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.255
- Well, I wear
contact lenses now.

00:38.299 --> 00:40.170
- Hey, guys, I'm sorry.
We have 15 minutes

00:40.214 --> 00:42.085
left in the session,
so we're gonna need to...

00:42.129 --> 00:43.304
- Okay, sorry, Dill.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.349
All right, look,
Dina, just smile,

00:45.393 --> 00:46.785
and I'll give you 50 bucks.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.439
- Fine.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.354
But I want to be Theodore.

00:52.139 --> 00:55.359
- Fine!
I'll be stupid Alvin...

00:55.403 --> 00:56.708
who can't follow rules

00:56.752 --> 00:58.884
and always gets
everyone in trouble.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.364
- Okay.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.105
Big smiles, everyone.

01:03.846 --> 01:05.369
Dina, you could show
less teeth.

01:05.413 --> 01:06.849
- You get none
or all of them, Dill.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.546
Pick a speed.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.421
â™ª

01:20.341 --> 01:23.344
- Aw, you're gonna make
a great mom.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.520
- I'm just checking to see
if this baby stuff is safe.

01:25.563 --> 01:28.697
Returned baby items
all get destroyed anyway.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.916
- And it will be destroyed
in about two to three years

01:30.960 --> 01:32.918
after my baby
is done using it.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.703
- Ah, so you're stealing it.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.400
- No, I'm not stealing it.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.359
You can't steal something
that's about to be destroyed.

01:38.402 --> 01:41.579
That's like if somebody's dying
and then you kill them.

01:41.623 --> 01:42.885
Is that murder?

01:42.928 --> 01:44.452
- That's exactly what that is.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.193
- Well, baby stuff
is really expensive,

01:46.236 --> 01:48.369
and it's not like I can reuse
anything I used with Emma.

01:48.412 --> 01:51.154
Did you know
that car seats expire?

01:51.198 --> 01:52.764
It's plastic and metal.

01:52.808 --> 01:56.290
Can you hit the light, please?
- Yeah.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.248
Oh.
both: Ew.

01:58.292 --> 02:01.947
- Do you think that's urine
or semen?

02:01.991 --> 02:04.820
- Which one of those
would be okay?

02:04.863 --> 02:06.909
- I never thought of myself
as photogenic,

02:06.952 --> 02:11.566
but Dill really knows how
to strengthen a collapsed chin.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.394
- So, in this one,
you guys are chefs

02:13.437 --> 02:15.352
waiting to eat the baby?

02:15.396 --> 02:17.963
- Yeah, but it's just a goof.
We don't really want to eat it.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.574
This one's a mystery.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.793
Who's really the pregnant one?

02:21.837 --> 02:24.187
- I'm sorry, hold up.
I got to go back.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.798
Wouldn't the chefs be preparing
the food, not waiting to eat it?

02:26.842 --> 02:29.366
- Well, there--Dina--

02:29.410 --> 02:32.543
maybe Dina's a new chef,
and we're taste-testing

02:32.587 --> 02:33.979
to see if we'd hire her.

02:34.023 --> 02:36.547
- And if you don't like
the taste of the baby...

02:36.591 --> 02:38.375
- I don't know.
We throw it away?

02:38.419 --> 02:41.248
- What, you'd throw your
half

02:41.291 --> 02:43.641
- Okay, I don't know!
We didn't really talk about it!

02:45.295 --> 02:46.470
- Make sure to highlight
my elbows.

02:46.514 --> 02:47.950
They're my best feature.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.821
- Why didn't you just get
Glenn's photographer

02:49.865 --> 02:51.301
to take your Christmas card
photo while you were there?

02:51.345 --> 02:52.781
- He was supposed to,
but then he got a call

02:52.824 --> 02:54.826
from his wife--
something about a house fire?

02:54.870 --> 02:56.480
I don't know.
I wasn't paying attention.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.917
I-I just want a card
that will blow my ugly sister

02:58.961 --> 03:01.006
Denise's card out of the water.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.530
- The one with
restless leg syndrome?

03:02.573 --> 03:03.748
- That's not what
makes her ugly, Sandra.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.489
That's what makes
her legs restless.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.839
- So then you just decided
to go with this setup?

03:07.883 --> 03:10.842
Hmm. Okay.

03:10.886 --> 03:13.280
It's the tree, isn't it?

03:13.323 --> 03:15.978
The tree sucks, right?
Sandra picked out the tree.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.459
- It's October, so there
weren't a lot of choices.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.680
- It's just feeling very
2003 Sears strip mall,

03:22.724 --> 03:25.509
if that makes any sense.
- Uh, that makes perfect sense.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.816
- I would just make it
less bad,

03:27.859 --> 03:29.644
if that makes any sense.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.820
- Uh-huh.
- Like, what if...

03:31.863 --> 03:33.517
"Miracle on 34th Street"
took place

03:33.561 --> 03:36.651
on the first day
of the L.A. riots?

03:36.694 --> 03:38.305
- Let's find out.

03:38.348 --> 03:41.482
[light Muzak playing
over speakers]

03:43.919 --> 03:46.400
- Oh, wow, cute car seat.

03:46.443 --> 03:48.010
Most moms are afraid
to buy this one

03:48.053 --> 03:49.968
because of the safety issues,
but I love it.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.712
Well, just that, like,
in an accident,

03:54.756 --> 03:56.932
it's prone to, um,
what's the word--

03:56.975 --> 03:57.976
crumpling?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.717
It's kind of a mess.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.416
They--they found babies just
littered on the pavement.

04:02.459 --> 04:05.723
Sometimes they're just
lying there...

04:05.767 --> 04:07.377
inside out.

04:07.421 --> 04:10.032
- Oh, my God.
Are they dead?

04:10.075 --> 04:14.079
- Well, they're inside out,
so I hope so.

04:14.123 --> 04:15.907
But if that makes
you uncomfortable,

04:15.951 --> 04:18.910
you could always return
this one for a safer car seat.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.347
- Oh, no, it's fine.

04:20.390 --> 04:23.001
It's just a gift
for my stupid neighbor.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.399
- Yeah, that one got away
from me--it went a little dark.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.053
- Okay, well, I have an idea.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.447
You're probably gonna hate it.
- Love that confidence.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.797
- I'm making you
a baby shower registry.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.539
- Ew. God, no.
I hate baby showers.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.498
I hate the--the stupid games
and the--the dumb decorations

04:41.542 --> 04:43.413
and people touching
your belly, saying,

04:43.457 --> 04:45.415
"Oh, my God. You're so big,"
as if that's a thing

04:45.459 --> 04:47.591
you're allowed to say to people,
which it's not.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.767
- Okay, well, I'm not saying you
actually have the baby shower,

04:49.811 --> 04:52.117
but if you create a registry,
then tomorrow

04:52.161 --> 04:54.729
when your "baby shower"
is over,

04:54.772 --> 04:57.601
you can get everything
on the registry for 20% off.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.343
- No, that's not gonna work.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.607
Yeah, what if--hmm...

05:03.651 --> 05:05.130
There's a small chance
this might be a good idea.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.958
Plus, you get
the little welcome box

05:07.002 --> 05:09.352
with the diapers
and the wipes and stuff--

05:09.396 --> 05:10.745
all free.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.355
- Damn it.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.965
I really want to hate this idea,
but I'm into it.

05:14.009 --> 05:18.056
- I know. I'm sorry.
So annoying.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.798
- This doesn't
seem Christmas-y.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.410
- So the idea there is
post-apocalyptic Christmas.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.020
Like, what if the Grinch
had succeeded

05:25.063 --> 05:27.631
in conquering Whoville
and Cindy Lou Who grew up,

05:27.675 --> 05:29.546
got boobs,
and was leading a resistance?

05:29.590 --> 05:32.070
Like, not that exactly,
but in that area.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.985
- I don't want to be insulting,

05:34.029 --> 05:36.988
but are we sure that idea
is not just pure gay nonsense?

05:37.032 --> 05:38.903
Dina...

05:38.947 --> 05:40.949
I am trying to give you
something original,

05:40.992 --> 05:42.690
something that will make
ugly Denise

05:42.733 --> 05:43.908
want to walk into the ocean.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.562
Can you please just trust me?

05:45.606 --> 05:47.390
- Honestly,
that's gonna be tough.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.827
I've always had this weird thing
about people with glasses.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.873
When I was younger,
a nearsighted man bit me.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.657
You know what?
It's a long story.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.704
I-I got hep A.
I'm okay now, but...

05:58.140 --> 06:00.490
All right,
let's see what else you got.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.884
- Okay, this next outfit
answers the question,

06:02.927 --> 06:05.800
what if Cogsworth
from "Beauty and the Beast"...

06:05.843 --> 06:07.671
was a hot tween?

06:07.715 --> 06:10.848
- I haven't heard from
my parents since the volcano.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.415
I'm starting to get
a little worried.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.764
- You're so lucky.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.506
Bo's mom calls, like,
all the time.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.510
Oh, my God. What?

06:20.554 --> 06:23.861
Amy, why didn't you tell me
you were having a baby shower?

06:23.905 --> 06:25.602
No, I'm--I'm not.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.691
- Then why did your registry
pop up on the system?

06:27.735 --> 06:29.432
It says your shower's today.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.434
- Here's your
complimentary gift box.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.742
- Hmm. It's smaller
than I thought it'd be.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.483
- Wait,
Amy's having a baby shower?

06:36.526 --> 06:38.528
- Mm-hmm.

06:38.572 --> 06:39.790
- None of us were.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.575
- Okay, look,
what happened was,

06:41.618 --> 06:44.055
I actually had
a really smart idea--

06:44.099 --> 06:45.970
- Okay, please,
I find that hard to believe.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.059
- So did I.
- Sarah, Sayid...

06:48.103 --> 06:50.105
Amy's throwing a baby shower,
and none of were invited.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.456
- Sayid, you started,
like, two days ago.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.545
- Well, I'm having a pool party
this weekend,

06:55.589 --> 06:57.634
and you're not invited.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.549
Sarah, Sayid,
you coming to my pool party?

06:59.593 --> 07:01.464
- I don't want to go.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.074
I want to go
to Amy's baby shower.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.076
- She doesn't want us!

07:08.645 --> 07:09.080
.

07:09.124 --> 07:12.127
- Why can't I just delete
the registry?

07:13.389 --> 07:15.260
- Tap--tap the screen harder.
That'll do it.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.479
I have another idea,

07:16.523 --> 07:18.263
and there's a chance
you may not love it.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.091
- Oh, I don't see how
that could possibly be true.

07:20.135 --> 07:23.443
- What if you did have
a baby shower?

07:23.486 --> 07:25.575
I'm not saying some big,
elaborate party, okay?

07:25.619 --> 07:28.360
Just, like, a quick ten-minute
thing in the break room--

07:28.404 --> 07:31.494
no games, no belly touching,
no one feels excluded,

07:31.538 --> 07:33.453
and you get a bunch of gifts.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.237
- Well, obviously
I like the gifts part.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.108
The gifts part is not
the problem.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.719
- How much is
that Pack 'n Play?

07:38.762 --> 07:41.504
80? Eh, I guess
that's not that bad.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.465
- Well, I mean,
at this point,

07:45.508 --> 07:47.423
it feels like people
would be disappointed

07:47.467 --> 07:48.990
if I didn't have the shower.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.166
For sure.

07:51.209 --> 07:54.299
- And, really, who am I to take
a party away from them?

07:54.343 --> 07:56.127
- You're a good friend.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.042
- Yeah.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.305
- Yes, now just reach out
and touch the polar bear, okay?

08:00.349 --> 08:01.742
You're not afraid.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.526
He just ate a seal
so he's not gonna eat you.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.312
- Yes!

08:07.356 --> 08:09.097
Ah, now try smiling,
but only using

08:09.140 --> 08:11.099
your eyes and ears.

08:11.142 --> 08:14.494
Yes, bitch!
You are killing it. Oh!

08:14.537 --> 08:16.147
Okay.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.758
What do you think?

08:17.801 --> 08:20.238
Wow.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.501
These pictures make me jealous

08:21.544 --> 08:23.503
of everyone I've ever
had sex with.

08:23.546 --> 08:24.634
- Mm-hmm.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.810
Should we...
take a couple more?

08:26.854 --> 08:29.378
I'm very comfortable
with nudity.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.685
- It was just gonna be
a small thing with family,

08:31.728 --> 08:33.643
so I didn't want
to tell anybody,

08:33.687 --> 08:35.645
but then I realized

08:35.689 --> 08:38.561
that you guys are like
my second family.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.042
- Aw, like the one
that my dad has.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.739
- Kind of. Yeah.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.654
So, you know,
it's just gonna be

08:44.698 --> 08:47.309
a real quick little thing
in the break room here--

08:47.352 --> 08:52.357
just a fast, quick,
easy, not-long shower.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.142
- That sounds amazing.

08:58.363 --> 09:02.324
- Well, I've been getting into
making fancy lady gloves lately.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.195
I think I have one
I can show you.

09:04.239 --> 09:05.762
- Oh, uh--

09:05.806 --> 09:08.199
- For my gift, I don't think
I can fit your entire name

09:08.243 --> 09:09.679
on a piece of rice,

09:09.723 --> 09:12.334
but I do think I can probably
get an A on there.

09:12.377 --> 09:15.206
- Or just give her
three pieces of rice.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.686
- No, guys,
all of this sounds like

09:16.730 --> 09:19.210
a lot of work
for what is, again,

09:19.254 --> 09:22.866
a small, fast, quick,
little, not-big-deal shower.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.347
So you guys can just grab
something off the registry,

09:25.390 --> 09:27.175
anything--
doesn't even matter what.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.265
It's like, I think there's
still a car seat on there.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.615
- Here it is.

09:32.659 --> 09:36.358
- Oh.
- Just imagine your hand in it.

09:36.401 --> 09:39.100
- Just have it say, uh,
"congrats on the baby."

09:39.143 --> 09:41.711
I can do curses for you.

09:43.408 --> 09:47.108
- I-I think just, uh,
what I said is good.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.588
- Hey.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.633
I heard Amy's having
a baby shower.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.157
- Ah, well,
it's barely a shower.

09:53.201 --> 09:56.247
It's a--it's a trickle.
It's a baby trickle.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.119
- That sounds wonderful.

09:58.162 --> 10:01.905
Hey, you know who likes
baby showers?

10:01.949 --> 10:04.429
Jerusha.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.866
- Yeah, well, you--

10:05.909 --> 10:08.433
you guys should totally
have one, you know.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.913
- Yeah, it's just
that we haven't

10:09.957 --> 10:12.263
really had time
to plan anything for the baby,

10:12.307 --> 10:13.917
'cause, you know,
I've been in the weeds

10:13.961 --> 10:16.441
trying to set up the Nest Cam.

10:16.485 --> 10:19.923
It keeps picking up a feed
from another baby...

10:19.967 --> 10:21.925
or a ghost.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.841
- W-well, if you need help
with the Nest Cam--

10:24.885 --> 10:26.451
Yeah, it just--

10:26.495 --> 10:29.585
God, if there was another
baby shower

10:29.629 --> 10:31.761
that was happening already

10:31.805 --> 10:33.894
that we could piggyback on,

10:33.937 --> 10:36.331
that would be so...

10:36.374 --> 10:38.159
great.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.291
- Yeah, well...

10:40.335 --> 10:41.815
And, believe me,
I would say,

10:41.858 --> 10:43.730
uh, you guys should join
this one, but--

10:43.773 --> 10:45.688
- That's a great idea.
Oh, my--

10:45.732 --> 10:47.559
Oh, my God.
Jerush'a gonna be so happy.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.518
- Right, but it's--it's just,
like, a quick, little,

10:49.561 --> 10:51.302
ten-minute thing
in the break room after work.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.609
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
it's a double baby shower.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.393
The break room's not
big enough.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.657
You're gonna need space
for the chocolate fountain

10:57.700 --> 11:00.485
and the balloon arch
and the juice luge.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.704
Hey, honey?
- No, that--

11:01.748 --> 11:03.271
- Guess what.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.533
- You're a young girl
from Nazareth.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.317
You're pregnant with Jesus,

11:06.361 --> 11:08.232
and you're trying to make
a go of it in a new city.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.581
But you're lost!
- Oh.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.192
- You're lost in New York!

11:11.235 --> 11:13.716
Let me know
if this is too much!

11:13.760 --> 11:15.326
- No, it's good!

11:15.370 --> 11:16.893
I feel like I'm European!

11:18.460 --> 11:22.464
- I'm having a really good time
with you!

11:22.507 --> 11:23.944
- Okay.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.728
This really has nothing to do
with Christmas,

11:25.772 --> 11:27.556
but it's very important to me
that we do this.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.866
I need you
to sign this, uh...

11:36.521 --> 11:38.698
- Garrett, please.
This is a hot set!

11:38.741 --> 11:40.569
- Oh, yeah. No, I know.
It's just--

11:40.612 --> 11:42.440
Yeah, I'm gonna--
I'm cool.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.661
- Garrett!

11:45.705 --> 11:46.880
Oh, yeah.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.359
No worries, I'm out of here.

11:48.403 --> 11:49.883
Oh.

11:49.926 --> 11:53.364
All right, well,
I'll see y'all later.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.627
Hang ten.

11:55.671 --> 11:58.848
- I felt guilty.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.676
You know I have
too much empathy.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.765
- Jerusha's friends are
the creepiest.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.462
Don't you remember
the shrimp boil?

12:04.506 --> 12:05.768
There was all
that mouth kissing.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.378
- There was.
- Yeah.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.554
- I can't believe this.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.731
I was pregnant, and no one
threw me a baby shower,

12:11.774 --> 12:13.036
and now Jerusha gets one?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.559
And she doesn't even work here.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.520
I could add your name
to the sign.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.435
- I mean,
you already have the kid.

12:20.478 --> 12:21.915
She already has the kid,
so she doesn't want to--

12:21.958 --> 12:24.308
- No. No. That'd be awesome.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.789
I mean, it's barely a shower.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.617
There aren't gonna be
any games.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.053
- Oh, I can handle the games.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.838
I know, like,
a million good ones,

12:31.881 --> 12:34.579
and Bo knows a guy
who owns a bunch of storks.

12:34.623 --> 12:35.885
I don't know
if that's helpful,

12:35.929 --> 12:37.844
but when they get drunk,
it's hilarious.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.062
- Super helpful.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.586
- Oh, this party's
gonna be sick!

12:41.630 --> 12:43.458
- Yeah!

12:45.852 --> 12:46.069

12:46.113 --> 12:49.159
[indistinct chatter,

12:50.639 --> 12:52.989
- Look at all the food
and different-colored cups.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.296
This is really special.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.950
- Yep, and all the people.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.474
So many people.
- Yeah, of course.

12:59.517 --> 13:00.867
I mean, well, between you

13:00.910 --> 13:03.521
and Cheyenne
and Jerusha and Diane.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.438
- You remember Diane
from the shrimp boil.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.136
I told her she could share
our shower.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.615
I hope that's okay.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.487
Diane!

13:12.530 --> 13:14.402
Yoo-hoo.
- Amy!

13:14.445 --> 13:16.665
Hi!
- Hi.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.188
Ooh.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.495
- Thank you so much
for including me.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.498
Oh, my gosh,
look at your belly.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.369
- Yep.
- You've really popped.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.414
- Mm-hmm.

13:26.457 --> 13:27.937
- Let's see if I can find

13:27.981 --> 13:29.330
your belly button
on the first try.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.158
- Oh.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.203
- No.

13:33.247 --> 13:36.076
- Do me next!
- Oh! Yeah...

13:39.122 --> 13:40.645
â™ª

13:40.689 --> 13:45.172

Caesarian salad.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.304
Amniocen

13:47.348 --> 13:49.219
- Why does every food need
a theme name?

13:49.263 --> 13:51.352
Baby Boy Wieners?
Why even write that?

13:51.395 --> 13:53.354
- It's better with no sign.

13:53.397 --> 13:56.183
Check out this
dad-to-be loading up on snacks.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.011
Got to keep that energy up,
right, know what I'm saying?

13:58.054 --> 13:59.708
- No idea what you're saying.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.102
- Talking about J-Man here.
Congrats on that baby, dog.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.364
What's up?
You know what?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.279
Babies, they're
the best, okay?

14:05.322 --> 14:07.281
You can, like, sit 'em down
and write stuff all over 'em.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.978
They can't do nothing about it.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.545
- Oh, yeah.
No, I'm not the--

14:10.588 --> 14:12.373
It's--it's Adam.

14:12.416 --> 14:15.028
- Nah, but I saw that clip
of two boning on the Internet.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.464
You know what I'm saying?
Wow!

14:16.507 --> 14:17.900
- Yeah.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.554
- She--she was already
pregnant.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.731
- Whoa! What if you got her
double pregnant?

14:22.774 --> 14:25.038
- Well, that's not
really possible.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.040
- Well, we don't know
it's impossible.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.259
- Yeah, that's true.
We don't knowknow that

14:29.303 --> 14:31.566
- I didn't get Amy
double pregnant.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.133
- I bet those babies
are all up in Amy's stomach

14:33.176 --> 14:34.569
just fighting it out.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.179
Like, "Yo, baby,
I was here first."

14:37.702 --> 14:39.313
"Give me that freakin'
umbilical cord, dog."

14:39.356 --> 14:41.228
I'ma slurp it all up.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.276
- And we got it.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.235
Great work, everyone.

14:48.278 --> 14:51.934
Darren, I will see you
Friday night at Zippers.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.676
Okay, what do you think?

14:54.719 --> 14:58.245
- Oh, wow. I look like
a hot, glowing Stanley Tucci.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.247
- Yeah.
- Sorry, redundant much, Dina.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.032
I know right.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.251
- These are good,

15:04.294 --> 15:07.471
but I have one more
really great idea.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.517
Might seem a little crazy.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.519
Do you trust me?

15:13.129 --> 15:14.957
- We're so lucky
that Darren had this harness

15:15.001 --> 15:16.306
in his trunk, huh?

15:16.350 --> 15:17.612
This is awesome.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.092
- Last but not least,

15:19.135 --> 15:21.964
I need to thank
my Uber driver, Dmitri,

15:22.008 --> 15:25.185
for getting me here
from Ponderosa so quickly.

15:25.228 --> 15:29.102
If I could've given you
six stars, I would have.

15:29.145 --> 15:32.409
- That was just beautiful,
Jerusha.

15:32.453 --> 15:35.543
Huh? Yeah.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.414
Now I'm gonna pass
the mic around

15:37.458 --> 15:40.374
so that everyone has
a chance to say something.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.593
Dmitri, would you like
to kick us off?

15:42.637 --> 15:44.508
- Actually, um...

15:44.552 --> 15:48.295
how about we keep
this party train rolling,

15:48.338 --> 15:51.472
and next stop is the gifts.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.039
Choo-choo.

15:53.082 --> 15:56.259
- Okay, somebody knows
I love trains.

15:56.303 --> 16:00.742
But gifts are like the caboose.
They always come at the...

16:00.785 --> 16:02.309
- End!

16:02.352 --> 16:06.356
But what if we shake it up
and do it now?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.838
Who wants to get crazy?

16:09.881 --> 16:11.492
- Amy.
- Sayid.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.842
- Mental illness is not a joke.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.539
Jerusha's cousin is crazy.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.238
- He ate all
of his fingernails off.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.675
- This is getting boring, yo.
Sleep-sleep!

16:20.718 --> 16:22.590
- Yeah, let's play games!

16:22.633 --> 16:24.505
- Ah, seeing as you're
husband-less,

16:24.548 --> 16:28.161
do you want your partner
to be Dmitri or

16:31.816 --> 16:34.210
This is nice and humiliating.
- I know. I'm sorry.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.690
Could you spread your legs?

16:35.733 --> 16:37.866
I'm having trouble
getting in the--

16:37.909 --> 16:41.348
uh, the undercarriage.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.480
I'll go around.
- Yeah.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.830
- Yeah, dip, dip, dip!
That's right. That's right.

16:45.874 --> 16:49.051
My baby's getting all
the nipples. What, what!

16:49.095 --> 16:50.357
Yeah!

16:50.400 --> 16:52.446
Jerusha, are you okay?

16:52.489 --> 16:54.665
Can someone check on Jeru--
Jerusha can't swim!

16:54.709 --> 16:57.277
- Okay, there we go.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.717
- It's peas and--
Oh, it's expired.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.241
Uh, don't eat the baby food.
The baby food is bad.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.895
It's bad.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.680
- There he is!

17:09.724 --> 17:11.726
Come one, Glenn!
You can do it!

Whoo, Glenn, you won!

17:13.728 --> 17:16.861
That's my big, strong daddy!
- Oh, no, no, no, hell, no.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.560
You knocked over that cone back
there, dog--I want a rematch.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.215
- No, no, no, it's--it's okay.
Let's calm down.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.347
It's just a game.
Just a game, huh?

17:24.391 --> 17:25.914
Just a game this, all right?

17:25.957 --> 17:27.872
- Well--hey, Bo.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.557
â™ª Boom, yeah

18:00.601 --> 18:02.559
- This party is never
going to end.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.431
And I don't even care
about the gifts anymore.

18:04.474 --> 18:07.608
I just want to get out of here.
How do we get out of here?

18:07.651 --> 18:10.698
- You could go into labor.
- I've been trying.

18:10.741 --> 18:13.135
- Excuse me,
I have a delivery here.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.443
- Oh, I didn't know we had
a delivery scheduled for today.

18:16.486 --> 18:19.446
Actually, that is my delivery.

18:19.489 --> 18:20.795
I have been waiting for that.

18:22.884 --> 18:25.278
You haven't even had
your caricature done

18:25.321 --> 18:26.366
by Diane yet.

18:26.409 --> 18:29.151
- Oh, uh, yeah, I'm sure.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.805
So I'll see you guys tomorrow.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.328
Thank you, everyone,
for coming to the party.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.808
It means so much.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.244
Jonah, if you could grab
the gifts on the way out.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.680
We can go handle this
in the warehouse.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.465
- Oh, that's okay.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.815
We can just take care of it
right here. Did you order...

18:40.858 --> 18:42.469
a baby?
- Oh.

18:42.512 --> 18:45.646
No, I did not order--

18:45.689 --> 18:47.517
This was not me.
- Yeah, I know,

18:47.561 --> 18:49.911
'cause I ordered this baby
stripper for Cheyenne, yo.

18:49.954 --> 18:52.305
Amy, you got to Venmo me
half of this, okay?

18:53.654 --> 18:56.439
Okay, that's--could you--

19:01.227 --> 19:01.444
.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.012
[sultry hip-hop music playing
over speakers]

19:05.144 --> 19:05.840
- I still think
this was a good idea.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.320
- Mm-hmm.

19:07.363 --> 19:10.236
- I mean, I-I'm enjoying myself.
- Oh, well, good.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.107
I'm glad
you're enjoying yourself.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.369
- It was all worth it.

19:13.413 --> 19:16.285
- Uh-oh,
I think it's tummy time.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.026
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, yes it is.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.506
- Oh, no, no--
- Now I'm having a good time.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.986
- I thought he was--
No, I'm--I'm good. Thanks.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.466
You're--that's--

19:23.510 --> 19:26.513
- So how did the rest
of the photo shoot go with Dina?

19:26.556 --> 19:29.080
- Sounds good.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.257
- Mateo!

19:31.300 --> 19:33.302
Can you hear me?

19:33.346 --> 19:37.132
I trust you,
but I really need to pee.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.961
This quaint little village
is about to get flooded.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.184
Oh, thank you, Sayid.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.663
It is Amy with a Y, though.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.883
- It's not my fault.
We just met.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.015
- That is very true. Yeah.

19:51.059 --> 19:54.323
Uh, I will just--
I'll put this my other...

19:54.367 --> 19:56.238
wood.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.675
Okay, well,
I think that was the last one,

19:58.719 --> 20:01.678
so thank you all so much
for my gifts.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.376
It was really nice of you--

20:03.419 --> 20:05.204
- Oh, wait, you forgot ours.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.380
- Oh, uh,
an embroidered badger.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.946
Awesome.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.383
- Oh, no, no, no,
this is for Diane.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.908
- Sorry, we just got you
something off the registry.

20:13.951 --> 20:16.215
- Oh, my God.
It's the car seat.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.521
- You can swap with Diane
if you want.

20:18.565 --> 20:22.351
- No, no! No. No, no, I, um--
I actually really like this.

20:22.395 --> 20:25.093
Not that I didn't like
this stuff,

20:25.136 --> 20:26.355
although some
of it was garbage.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.922
Not, like, trash garbage.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.228
Just, like,
I can actually use this,

20:29.271 --> 20:30.446
and I really, really love it.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.361
- Oh, good.
- Thank you so much.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.233
Thank you.

20:36.104 --> 20:39.063
- So how long
have you guys been dating?

20:39.107 --> 20:40.630
No

20:40.674 --> 20:42.371
That's--
Uh-uh.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.243
That's not--
Why would you--

20:46.419 --> 20:48.377
How did you know?

20:48.421 --> 20:51.467
- You just seem really happy
for the first time in a while.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.556
- Huh.
- I'm playing, man.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.732
I saw you guys making out
in the parking lot last week.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.257
Congratulations, though.

20:58.300 --> 21:02.391
[Dina grunting,
train whistle blows]

21:02.435 --> 21:04.306
- Sandra! Sandra!

21:04.350 --> 21:06.569
Oh, finally.
Come get me down.

21:06.613 --> 21:09.268
Oh, thank God. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.227
Oh, no.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.142
Are you serious?

21:14.185 --> 21:18.277
Oh, I respect you as much
as I hate you right now.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.453
Oh, Sandra!
