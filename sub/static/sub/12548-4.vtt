WEBVTT

00:02.025 --> 00:03.827
Back away!

00:03.936 --> 00:05.496
We shouldn't even be here!
Without us,

00:05.569 --> 00:07.670
they have to surrender,
and we all go home.

00:07.849 --> 00:10.009
You really think you can
break that kind of devotion?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.312
Well, she's got faith.

00:11.418 --> 00:13.188
She's in love.
Those things are curable.

00:14.467 --> 00:15.886
Hopper, stay with me!

00:16.035 --> 00:18.331
Gil Langston, Captain.
Thank you for the pickup.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.960
- How's your man?
- Needs a hospital.

00:19.961 --> 00:21.440
We gotta leave right now!

00:23.027 --> 00:23.978
Gil!

00:29.618 --> 00:32.183
I need a place to keep my friend
until I can get him home.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.265
Your captain reneged on our deal.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.121
One of you must pay for his failure.

00:36.234 --> 00:37.274
I will let you choose who.

00:37.359 --> 00:38.559
Don't do this!
We had a deal!

00:38.560 --> 00:40.224
Okay, him. Take him.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.424
No! No, no, no, no!

00:41.522 --> 00:43.750
- Red, I'm sorry!
- Josh! Cortez!

00:48.723 --> 00:49.883
There's one more!

00:50.030 --> 00:52.148
No, there is not.
You were late.

00:52.477 --> 00:54.357
- He killed Red?
- What are you gonna do, Sam?

00:54.457 --> 00:55.817
We can't keep asking more of them.

00:55.932 --> 00:57.132
The one thing we have out here

00:57.133 --> 00:58.773
is our loyalty to each other.
That's it!

- Torpedo five seconds to impact.

Impact in three, two...

Explosion close aboard...
Port side!

01:47.357 --> 01:49.117
Firing point procedures,

01:49.118 --> 01:49.862
Prepare to fire.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.400
We have a firing malfunction, ma'am.

01:51.401 --> 01:53.541
Left full rudder steady,
3-2-9.

01:54.764 --> 01:56.797
- It's jammed.
- Conn, XO cannot secure flooding.

Torpedo room report.

01:59.821 --> 02:01.172
30 seconds, maybe.

02:01.460 --> 02:02.679
Recommend emergency blow.

02:02.785 --> 02:04.390
The recommendation is surface to repair.

02:07.249 --> 02:08.249
We're not going anywhere.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.014
Maintain order depth.
Secure the flooding.

02:10.154 --> 02:11.158
Get ready to fight.

02:11.521 --> 02:12.761
Are you sure you wanna do that?

02:12.794 --> 02:15.091
In combat, a ship on the surface
is a dead ship, sir.

02:16.139 --> 02:17.739
<i>Conn, torpedo room flooding has stopped,</i>

02:17.740 --> 02:19.493
<i>lined up to de-water</i>
<i>with drain pump.</i>

02:21.782 --> 02:23.874
Flooding in torpedo room is secure.

02:24.291 --> 02:25.307
Drill concluded.

02:28.479 --> 02:30.679
Keeping this boat moving
was a gutsy call, Lieutenant,

02:30.680 --> 02:32.371
but the right one.
Well done.

02:33.033 --> 02:34.180
But our crew...

02:34.513 --> 02:35.752
is another story.

02:36.837 --> 02:38.848
What the hell's
he got us drilling for, anyway?

02:38.960 --> 02:40.486
Firing against our own damn people.

02:40.592 --> 02:42.121
Our own people just tried to kill us,

02:42.215 --> 02:43.635
you stupid hillbilly son of a...

02:43.763 --> 02:45.782
Hey, hey...

02:46.168 --> 02:47.873
Hey, cool it, Wallace!
All right!

02:47.976 --> 02:50.056
I'm sick of you, Jonesy!
One more, and you're gonna

02:50.088 --> 02:51.621
have to throw with me, son.

02:52.537 --> 02:53.556
Aye, COB.

02:57.213 --> 02:58.961
You may not have faith in your captain,

02:59.069 --> 03:01.362
but you damn well will have faith in me.

03:02.444 --> 03:04.982
You will execute your duties
for the chief of boat.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.545
- Aye, COB.
- Aye, COB.

03:09.812 --> 03:11.606
Emergency action message, sir.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.103
DC's giving us a firing order?

03:17.508 --> 03:19.378
It's not a firing order, sir.

03:19.478 --> 03:20.700
Read it, Lieutenant.

03:21.169 --> 03:23.489
"The Department of the Navy
article 32 has been scheduled

03:23.507 --> 03:26.811
in regards to criminal charges
against Captain Marcus Chaplin

03:27.027 --> 03:29.253
and Executive Officer Samuel Kendal,

03:29.456 --> 03:31.433
relating to acts of treason and terrorism

03:31.538 --> 03:33.193
against the United States."

03:48.528 --> 03:50.024
Well, that's not possible.
I've...

03:50.124 --> 03:52.084
Okay, look, like I've told
the last four people,

03:52.085 --> 03:53.569
all of my payments are current.

03:53.672 --> 03:54.526
There's...

03:54.885 --> 03:56.273
Wait a second.

03:57.115 --> 03:59.262
<i>...and Sam Kendal,</i>
<i>Executive Officer</i>

03:59.399 --> 04:00.899
<i>of the USS Colorado</i>

04:01.032 --> 04:02.794
<i>have been officially indicted today</i>

04:02.918 --> 04:04.326
<i>by the Department of the Navy.</i>

04:04.436 --> 04:06.198
<i>It's been just five days</i>
<i>since the Colorado</i>

04:06.308 --> 04:08.378
<i>fired one of its 18 trident missiles,</i>

04:08.571 --> 04:10.439
<i>detonating it 200 miles off the coast</i>

04:10.558 --> 04:13.253
<i>of our nation's capital,</i>
<i>where tensions remain high.</i>

04:13.379 --> 04:14.899
<i>White House lawyers say the legal move</i>

04:14.900 --> 04:16.387
<i>paves the way for Chaplin and Kendal</i>

04:16.512 --> 04:18.772
<i>to be stripped of their</i>
<i>rights as American citizens,</i>

04:18.959 --> 04:20.851
<i>and even allows for the two men in charge</i>

04:20.986 --> 04:21.935
<i>of the USS...</i>

04:36.020 --> 04:37.864
It's seaman Redman, sir.

04:43.691 --> 04:45.032
Don't go there, Josh.

04:45.199 --> 04:46.811
You had no choice.

04:46.913 --> 04:48.233
You don't have to worry about me.

04:54.705 --> 04:57.225
- I want you to set up interviews with...
- Already done, sir.

04:57.226 --> 04:58.986
Sitting down with Brannan
and Cortez today.

05:01.533 --> 05:02.733
I need to talk to the Captain.

05:02.734 --> 05:05.334
- You're way out of line here, Anders.
- I need to go home, sir.

05:05.335 --> 05:06.975
I have family issues I need to attend to.

05:07.087 --> 05:08.607
I'm supposed to be on the downhill run

05:08.608 --> 05:10.408
of a 3-year enlistment,
and now all of this?

05:11.028 --> 05:12.394
I gotta go home, sir.

05:12.570 --> 05:13.944
This is hard on all of us,

05:14.790 --> 05:16.103
but the XO is correct.

05:16.965 --> 05:18.045
If you need to speak to me,

05:18.046 --> 05:20.126
you will do so through
the proper chain of command.

05:20.127 --> 05:22.346
- Lieutenant, escort the chief out.
- Yes, sir.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.193
I didn't sign up for this.

05:25.483 --> 05:27.779
None of us did.
And I'm not the only one, sir.

05:37.174 --> 05:38.746
He is right about that, sir.

05:39.754 --> 05:41.148
He's not the only one.

05:41.357 --> 05:42.739
We got a serious morale problem.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.577
Everybody just wants to go home.

05:45.552 --> 05:47.021
So maybe we let them.

05:47.132 --> 05:48.970
Maybe we give them the choice.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.741
You're looking for volunteers?

05:50.839 --> 05:53.199
Every member of this crew
has already volunteered twice...

05:53.259 --> 05:54.499
Once when they joined the Navy,

05:54.589 --> 05:57.020
and again by signing up
for submariner duty.

05:57.182 --> 06:00.242
I think you overestimate
how many of them will stay, sir.

06:00.356 --> 06:01.788
Given a just cause,

06:02.236 --> 06:03.917
will they raise their hands again?

06:04.786 --> 06:06.094
I believe they will.

06:06.381 --> 06:07.781
And if we can't trust them to stay,

06:08.788 --> 06:10.738
what <i>can</i> we trust them to do?

06:14.532 --> 06:17.212
We were all held in the same room
with our hands behind our backs.

06:17.695 --> 06:19.239
As the deadline approached,

06:19.356 --> 06:20.795
Serrat would check in more often,

06:20.901 --> 06:22.835
reminding us that our time
was getting short.

06:22.941 --> 06:24.621
And once the deadline passed, he said that

06:24.741 --> 06:27.459
what was about to happen
was our commander's fault.

06:27.913 --> 06:29.448
We begged,

06:29.813 --> 06:31.000
but he took Red away,

06:31.128 --> 06:33.682
and... we heard
four gunshots.

06:33.999 --> 06:36.835
Were you ever separated
at any time for any reason?

06:37.955 --> 06:40.035
So neither of you spent
any time alone with Serrat?

06:40.137 --> 06:41.454
No, sir.

06:41.629 --> 06:42.811
No.

06:44.209 --> 06:45.478
Okay.

06:45.889 --> 06:46.845
You did good.

06:47.645 --> 06:50.125
What'd you think, I was just
gonna roll up in a ball and cry?

06:53.726 --> 06:55.046
"To the crew of the USS Colorado,

06:55.047 --> 06:56.687
given our circumstances, it is only right

06:56.688 --> 06:58.128
that you should each have the choice

06:58.129 --> 06:59.489
whether to remain under my command

06:59.490 --> 07:01.186
or to be honorably dismissed.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.288
Those choosing to leave will be required

07:03.289 --> 07:04.649
to continue executing their duties

07:04.650 --> 07:05.970
until such a time as safe transit

07:06.032 --> 07:07.849
back to the United States
can be arranged."

07:09.580 --> 07:11.540
"Captain Marcus Chaplin."

07:13.144 --> 07:14.681
Come in.

07:15.250 --> 07:18.205
I can't do my job
if you keep me in the dark.

07:18.356 --> 07:20.396
I'm the XO of this boat,
and I respectfully insist

07:20.397 --> 07:21.757
that you inform me of <i>any</i> decision

07:21.758 --> 07:24.691
that will <i>radically</i> affect
the disposition of my crew.

07:25.017 --> 07:27.297
I thought my feelings on
this subject were pretty clear,

07:27.298 --> 07:29.138
- as were yours.
- You've made your decision,

07:29.139 --> 07:30.479
and ll see that it's carried out.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.771
But you shouldn't have put me
on my heels like that.

07:48.565 --> 07:50.254
I need to talk to you for a minute.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.601
What are you planning on doing

07:53.727 --> 07:55.866
with the body in my refrigerator?

07:56.380 --> 07:59.113
I'm sorry. It's just...
It's been there for a week.

07:59.224 --> 08:01.876
I know it must be hard,
but your friend deserves better.

08:02.253 --> 08:04.637
James. Hop's waking up.

08:05.558 --> 08:06.855
He's not doing so good, man.

08:11.799 --> 08:12.884
What are you doing here?

08:13.482 --> 08:14.842
Look, I'm not sure if you noticed,

08:14.843 --> 08:17.050
but most of the hospital staff
have abandoned ship.

08:17.390 --> 08:18.986
If you want, I could have

08:18.987 --> 08:21.627
one of the corpsman come up from
the boat and have a look at him.

08:22.516 --> 08:24.856
It's bad, James.
I need help.

08:25.168 --> 08:26.424
Okay, buddy.

08:30.917 --> 08:32.307
Hospital's out of morphine.

08:32.453 --> 08:34.296
Someone raided the supply cabinet.

08:39.409 --> 08:40.457
Listen.

08:40.570 --> 08:42.929
You wanna talk to someone
on my team, you talk to me.

08:43.249 --> 08:45.127
Stay away from my guys, especially Hopper.

08:45.241 --> 08:46.761
You ever ask yourself why the Illinois

08:46.762 --> 08:48.082
tried to blow us out of the water

08:48.083 --> 08:49.712
30 minutes after we picked you up?

08:50.199 --> 08:51.999
Well, your captain disobeyed
a direct order.

08:52.116 --> 08:54.156
You think that might have
something to do with it?

08:54.157 --> 08:55.743
Hop. Hang in there, buddy.

08:55.845 --> 08:58.028
I'm gonna get you fixed up.
Viper, stay with him.

08:58.616 --> 09:00.631
Hey, I'm about to lose my crew.

09:00.922 --> 09:02.482
And if I'm gonna convince them to stay,

09:02.483 --> 09:04.123
I need to know what this is really about.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.756
You guys bug out of Pakistan
with a wounded man,

09:06.915 --> 09:09.272
and a few hours later
the US is nuking the joint?

09:10.132 --> 09:12.086
How do you connect the dots?

09:13.040 --> 09:15.013
Fish, let's roll.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.868
Keep her away from him.

09:26.162 --> 09:27.242
Had this fixed an hour ago.

09:27.348 --> 09:28.908
I'm just double-checking
the riggings.

09:29.576 --> 09:30.816
It's good to keep busy.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.284
Keeps the mind focused.
I get it.

09:35.362 --> 09:36.482
Yeah.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.362
It does.

09:39.672 --> 09:41.163
You saw the "Stay/Go" list?

09:41.298 --> 09:43.724
- Pretty ballsy move.
- Yes, it was.

09:43.929 --> 09:45.665
Listen, Cortez, you hold a lot of sway,

09:45.958 --> 09:47.591
especially with the female enlisted.

09:48.404 --> 09:49.747
We could use your help.

09:50.392 --> 09:52.632
Listen, if I didn't know
we were doing the right thing,

09:52.633 --> 09:54.102
my name would be on that "Go" list,

09:54.197 --> 09:55.437
right up there with the others.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.151
So I get you the whole female compliment

09:57.152 --> 09:59.266
up on your "Stay" list, all of a sudden

09:59.376 --> 10:01.359
the boys think twice about turning tail?

10:03.090 --> 10:04.720
You didn't hear it from me.

10:08.571 --> 10:09.811
When I ran the theory past him

10:09.938 --> 10:11.574
that his SEAL guys got us shot at,

10:11.719 --> 10:13.062
seemed like it rang his bell.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.975
That's interesting.
Stay on him.

10:16.096 --> 10:17.010
Yes, sir.

10:17.011 --> 10:18.451
So we've talked it through the crew.

10:18.561 --> 10:20.201
We're gonna lose
three-quarters or more.

10:20.317 --> 10:22.117
If that happens,
we're not gonna have enough

10:22.118 --> 10:23.701
- to safely man a shift.
- Gun!

10:31.600 --> 10:32.701
I'm fine!

11:06.152 --> 11:07.682
I was acting on orders.

11:07.832 --> 11:09.780
- From who?
- A higher authority than you.

11:09.893 --> 11:10.893
Higher than your captain?

11:10.926 --> 11:12.220
He's not my captain!

11:12.513 --> 11:14.348
He's the enemy, just like you.

11:14.349 --> 11:16.829
You don't like your situation
here, there's a "Stay/Go" list.

11:16.830 --> 11:18.310
Why don't you just sign up and leave?

11:18.311 --> 11:19.471
Because those were my orders.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.692
- How long you think this is gonna last...
- Sit...

11:21.693 --> 11:22.534
...anyway, XO?

11:22.638 --> 11:24.256
Who were your orders from, Wallace?

11:24.374 --> 11:25.670
Who were they from?

11:27.389 --> 11:28.977
You guys are all dead.

11:32.073 --> 11:33.635
All of you.

11:43.206 --> 11:45.920
If you wanted to go home,
Josh, after what happened...

11:46.039 --> 11:47.178
You don't get it.

11:48.717 --> 11:50.308
I'm not leaving anyone behind.

11:50.949 --> 11:51.906
Not again.

11:56.623 --> 11:58.688
Americans volunteered after 9/11,

11:58.799 --> 12:00.397
all the way back to Valley Forge.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.888
Marcus thinks he's George Washington now?

12:02.942 --> 12:05.222
Maybe the Captain is aware
of something that you're not.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.307
Well, if he asks the men
if they want to go home,

12:07.308 --> 12:09.428
the only answer he's gonna get
is, "Where's the boat

12:09.429 --> 12:10.669
and how many bags
can I take?"

12:11.512 --> 12:12.925
You don't get it, do you?

12:13.599 --> 12:14.977
He's done the calculations.

12:15.106 --> 12:16.586
He's consulted with the military gods

12:16.617 --> 12:18.993
he adores so much,
and he knows he's lost 'em.

12:22.465 --> 12:24.025
If you put your name on that "Go" list,

12:24.042 --> 12:27.298
this thing is over.
Don't do it.

12:27.421 --> 12:29.541
Hell, I got front-row seats
to the end of the world.

12:29.542 --> 12:30.803
You think I'm missing that?

12:31.229 --> 12:34.023
Besides, I'm gonna paddle you,
Kendal, and Captain Chaplin

12:34.175 --> 12:35.943
right to your treason trial.

12:37.296 --> 12:38.546
Count on it.

12:40.399 --> 12:41.474
XO on the conn.

12:44.208 --> 12:45.306
I need a word.

12:46.780 --> 12:48.340
I'm sure you've heard about the attempt

12:48.341 --> 12:50.141
- on the Captain's life.
- Yeah. Is he okay?

12:50.142 --> 12:52.285
He's fine.
I want to keep it that way.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.320
I need to know about any messages...

12:54.484 --> 12:55.924
Radio signals, coded communications,

12:55.925 --> 12:58.245
anything that might have come
through the boat's channels

12:58.246 --> 12:59.372
the last few days.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.517
Something you want to tell me, Cahill?

13:06.816 --> 13:08.252
<i>Marcus Chaplin has been deemed</i>

13:08.374 --> 13:10.662
<i>unfit for command, as has his XO.</i>

13:10.945 --> 13:13.727
<i>Your government now considers</i>
<i>them enemy combatants.</i>

13:13.949 --> 13:15.974
<i>Your orders are to terminate command,</i>

13:16.157 --> 13:18.058
<i>using lethal force if necessary,</i>

13:18.214 --> 13:21.106
<i>and seize or scuttle the USS Colorado.</i>

13:21.819 --> 13:23.801
<i>May God fill you with patriot zeal,</i>

13:24.189 --> 13:25.672
<i>and bless this endeavor.</i>

13:30.239 --> 13:31.789
When did this come through?

13:32.547 --> 13:34.036
I received it yesterday.

13:34.521 --> 13:37.695
It's the Secretary of Defense.
I-I didn't know what to do.

13:38.078 --> 13:39.240
Understood.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.393
You're dismissed, Lieutenant.

13:43.288 --> 13:44.768
We've been through
the family-grams.

13:44.902 --> 13:46.422
Five other crewmen, including Wallace,

13:46.423 --> 13:47.775
received the same message.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.214
We've put together a detail.

13:49.234 --> 13:50.837
We'll detain them all for questioning.

13:51.586 --> 13:53.986
Well, they'll be questioned,
but no one's getting detained.

13:53.987 --> 13:55.507
It's not a crime to receive a message.

13:56.049 --> 13:57.409
Well, what about not reporting it?

13:57.410 --> 13:59.370
A-at least let me take them
off the duty roster.

13:59.487 --> 14:02.007
We can't have them on the boat
until we know where they stand.

14:02.028 --> 14:03.548
Fine. But I expect
the crew assembled

14:03.549 --> 14:05.721
and ready to drill...
Today, as scheduled.

14:06.105 --> 14:07.427
We can't guarantee your safety.

14:07.473 --> 14:08.833
Let us get you a ride to the boat.

14:08.950 --> 14:10.550
You can be on board before the muster...

14:10.551 --> 14:12.431
Grace, you're gonna want to
learn to recognize

14:12.432 --> 14:14.089
when the Captain's made up his mind.

14:14.705 --> 14:15.894
We muster at 1600,

14:16.127 --> 14:19.106
and I'll board the way
I always have... with my crew.

14:24.272 --> 14:25.531
Okay.

14:28.851 --> 14:31.225
You gonna be able
to get this off the island?

14:32.611 --> 14:33.998
I'm not gonna ask how, am I?

14:34.110 --> 14:35.515
No, you're not.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.518
Do I look okay?

14:40.070 --> 14:41.467
You look good.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.608
Whenever you're ready.

14:46.891 --> 14:48.229
Hi, babe.

14:50.285 --> 14:52.694
This is the only way
I could get you a message.

14:54.658 --> 14:55.938
But it might be the last message

14:55.939 --> 14:58.367
I-I can get to you for a while,
so there's...

15:00.307 --> 15:01.980
something you need to know.

15:05.547 --> 15:07.267
"...global markets
in rare earth minerals,

15:07.268 --> 15:09.108
key components in everything
from cell phones

15:09.208 --> 15:10.531
to advanced weapons systems,

15:10.673 --> 15:12.946
is predicted to explode
in the coming years,

15:13.064 --> 15:15.899
yielding hundreds of billions
of dollars in profits."

15:17.074 --> 15:18.679
There you have it.

15:19.128 --> 15:21.599
Your science, your chemicals.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.425
Everything your boyfriend said you needed.

15:25.632 --> 15:27.111
I can't do this now.

15:27.247 --> 15:28.850
But your boyfriend, the geologist,

15:28.851 --> 15:30.451
he was so enthusiastic about all of this

15:30.568 --> 15:32.820
when he persuaded me to spend
so much of <i>my money</i>

15:33.023 --> 15:34.476
to run tests.

15:34.820 --> 15:36.094
And then he ran away.

15:36.588 --> 15:38.355
Now there is a debt, Sophie.

15:39.184 --> 15:40.439
And debts are paid.

16:00.482 --> 16:01.757
My men are nearby.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.296
And that helps you how?

16:03.760 --> 16:05.797
A lot of hospital workers
got off this island.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.175
You know what I think?

16:07.330 --> 16:08.650
I think they paid you in morphine

16:08.651 --> 16:09.898
for their tickets out.

16:13.635 --> 16:15.435
Now I got a friend
that needs that joy juice

16:15.436 --> 16:16.663
more than you do.

16:18.066 --> 16:20.464
Of course.
Whatever you like.

16:24.579 --> 16:27.246
He'll be lucky

16:27.247 --> 16:29.047
if someone doesn't
take another shot at him.

16:32.288 --> 16:33.759
Crew, atten-hut!

16:34.612 --> 16:35.806
At ease.

16:39.584 --> 16:40.894
He thinks he's bulletproof.

16:41.014 --> 16:43.004
No, but he wants them to think that he is.

16:51.605 --> 16:52.473
Ten-hut!

16:53.215 --> 16:54.462
Right face.

16:54.464 --> 16:55.808
Forward march.

16:59.747 --> 17:02.374
<i>...is ongoing</i>
<i>and equipment space...</i>

17:02.532 --> 17:04.097
The Captain's list...

17:05.200 --> 17:06.489
Stay, go...

17:07.329 --> 17:09.694
- It's a load of crap, right?
- Sorry. How do you mean?

17:09.792 --> 17:11.813
I'm the senior nuke-rated
chief on this boat.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.804
He's not gonna let me go home
no matter what.

17:13.944 --> 17:16.387
You think he's gonna trust
some PO3 to run his reactor?

17:16.579 --> 17:19.333
Lucky me.
I'm indispensable.

17:52.433 --> 17:53.761
<i>This universal condemnation</i>

17:53.896 --> 17:56.249
<i>for what is coming to be called</i>
<i>"The Bolton Doctrine,"</i>

17:56.402 --> 17:58.496
<i>the preemptive use of nuclear force.</i>

17:58.634 --> 18:00.491
<i>Meanwhile, China conducted naval drills</i>

18:00.614 --> 18:02.492
<i>off the coast of Taiwan, which...</i>

18:05.787 --> 18:07.843
There must be someone
you can talk to, dad.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.222
And what would I ask them?

18:09.578 --> 18:11.018
Well, after everything you have done

18:11.055 --> 18:13.103
for this president,
for his administration,

18:13.236 --> 18:16.448
why would they steal the very
thing we built for them?

18:16.664 --> 18:18.099
They could have asked.

18:18.212 --> 18:19.688
You're taking this too personally.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.602
Too personally?
Someone got the man

18:21.729 --> 18:24.593
that I was... sleeping with
to steal the only specs

18:24.724 --> 18:26.241
of a multibillion-dollar
system.

18:26.362 --> 18:27.572
That is our money.

18:27.668 --> 18:30.049
So you're damn right
I am taking this personally.

18:30.161 --> 18:31.229
Let it go.

18:32.058 --> 18:33.154
No.

18:34.034 --> 18:35.236
I'm not gonna let it go.

18:35.346 --> 18:37.920
What do they want with it?
Why would he take it?

18:38.031 --> 18:39.670
Because I told him to.

18:41.117 --> 18:43.607
Because when the president
asks you to do something,

18:43.717 --> 18:44.629
you do it.

18:44.755 --> 18:47.061
You just handed over our family's future,

18:47.192 --> 18:49.629
- a future that...
- No, I protected our family's future.

18:49.759 --> 18:52.045
You're just too stubborn to see that yet.

18:52.504 --> 18:54.309
I worked my ass off on that project.

18:54.445 --> 18:56.184
You did a wonderful job on Perseus.

18:56.731 --> 18:58.701
But Pakistan is in ruins,

18:58.852 --> 19:01.447
our government condemned by our allies.

19:01.596 --> 19:03.876
There are a lot of nervous
powerful people in Washington

19:03.963 --> 19:07.702
right now, so we are going
to sit this one out.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.818
You just have to trust me this time.

19:13.222 --> 19:15.191
- Always.
- Good.

19:17.491 --> 19:18.931
That's my girl.

19:23.551 --> 19:25.533
You're a hard man, Hop.

19:25.644 --> 19:27.143
It's gonna feel better real soon.

19:34.806 --> 19:37.644
Now, buddy, I need your help
figuring out this mess.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.244
We may be here a while.

19:39.363 --> 19:41.683
Who knows how safe things
are gonna be for us back there?

19:41.684 --> 19:43.230
No, I got to get back.
I got to...

19:44.307 --> 19:45.477
I got to get home.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.055
Buddy.

19:47.494 --> 19:48.717
Hey. Listen to me.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.646
Why did we kill that guy?

19:51.638 --> 19:53.052
Orders change.

19:53.162 --> 19:55.315
Who? Who changed
the orders?

19:56.910 --> 19:58.977
They change all the time.

19:59.093 --> 20:00.138
Hop.

20:04.511 --> 20:06.031
Lieutenant Shepard, you have the conn.

20:07.382 --> 20:09.062
Attention all hands, this is your Captain.

20:09.114 --> 20:11.620
<i>We don't drill to be good.</i>
<i>We drill to be perfect.</i>

20:11.841 --> 20:15.104
We will commence torpedo
attack scenario once again.

20:15.226 --> 20:17.264
The clock starts now.

20:18.861 --> 20:20.130
Christine, it's me...
Paul.

20:25.083 --> 20:27.647
- I've been trying to call you.
- Yeah, I turned my phone off.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.264
It's been ringing
nonstop since the indictment.

20:30.370 --> 20:31.725
Yeah. That was always coming.

20:32.852 --> 20:34.495
Navy's cut off Sam's pay.

20:35.570 --> 20:37.944
Credit cards were canceled.
I have no savings.

20:38.483 --> 20:40.797
There's no gas in my car, no groceries.

20:42.249 --> 20:43.526
How does this happen?

20:44.624 --> 20:45.744
One day everything's normal,

20:45.844 --> 20:48.031
- and then the next you can't even eat.
- Look.

20:50.064 --> 20:51.345
I got...

20:52.575 --> 20:53.968
$217.

20:54.909 --> 20:56.075
Take it.

20:56.173 --> 20:57.453
Okay, you're proud, that's good,

20:57.454 --> 20:58.654
but you're gonna have to learn

20:58.655 --> 21:00.135
how to accept help when it's offered.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.569
My mom... she's not well,
and...

21:07.939 --> 21:09.722
she has no money, so she can't just come,

21:09.833 --> 21:11.421
and Sam's parents are no help.

21:12.633 --> 21:15.194
- My sister... she's got the kids, so...
- Yeah.

21:15.471 --> 21:16.596
There's no one.

21:16.755 --> 21:17.911
I know.

21:18.531 --> 21:19.571
I know.

21:20.188 --> 21:21.411
Listen to me.

21:22.756 --> 21:24.289
You're gonna be under a microscope.

21:24.954 --> 21:27.288
Everything you say, everything you do...

21:27.558 --> 21:29.713
it's gonna be relentless and vicious.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.171
You're gonna be unbreakable.

21:31.474 --> 21:34.213
And I'm gonna be there
every step of the way. Okay?

21:35.252 --> 21:36.515
You're not alone.

21:38.125 --> 21:39.800
Come on.

21:41.957 --> 21:43.197
Mrs. Kendal,
what do you think

21:43.198 --> 21:44.358
about your husband's actions?

21:44.359 --> 21:45.290
What the...

21:45.981 --> 21:46.667
Christine!

21:46.767 --> 21:48.083
No. No!

21:48.706 --> 21:51.808
- Mrs. Kendal, over here! Over here!
- Get off my property!

21:51.941 --> 21:53.292
Get off now!

21:53.753 --> 21:55.673
Do you consider
your husband to be a terrorist?

21:58.279 --> 21:59.696
Do you feel he's a traitor?!

22:01.677 --> 22:02.810
Come back inside.

22:03.425 --> 22:05.495
Mrs. Kendal,
why won't you make a statement?

22:10.281 --> 22:12.587
Leave me alone!

22:13.883 --> 22:15.429
Why are you watching me?!

22:15.542 --> 22:18.169
Why are you lying about
my husband, you cowards?!

22:18.277 --> 22:21.208
Come out here and call me a traitor
to my face, you liars!

22:21.419 --> 22:23.392
Why aren't you reporting about them?

22:23.496 --> 22:25.085
The government detained me!

22:25.210 --> 22:27.433
They're lying about
what happened to the Colorado!

22:27.550 --> 22:31.079
I am a US citizen,
and I will not be silenced!

22:31.296 --> 22:32.816
I want the truth, and you should, too!

23:00.498 --> 23:01.338
<i>Hi, babe.</i>

23:01.451 --> 23:03.553
<i>You're gonna see some of</i>
<i>the crew coming home soon.</i>

23:04.041 --> 23:05.330
<i>I'm not gonna be one of them.</i>

23:05.616 --> 23:07.696
<i>I just... I feel it in my heart</i>
<i>that I have to stay</i>

23:07.697 --> 23:08.777
<i>and see this thing through.</i>

23:09.088 --> 23:10.133
<i>I know it.</i>

23:10.932 --> 23:12.861
<i>I know, I know.</i>
<i>I get patriotic.</i>

23:12.964 --> 23:14.047
Turn that off.

23:14.230 --> 23:15.222
Hoo-rah.

23:15.453 --> 23:16.682
<i>I've always known that.</i>

23:17.309 --> 23:18.869
He's a true blue, this one.

23:19.547 --> 23:21.644
You promised to send that, not watch it.

23:21.753 --> 23:23.181
And I almost did.

23:23.295 --> 23:25.146
Just think the fun I would have missed.

23:26.191 --> 23:28.445
It's meant for his wife,
not for your amusement.

23:29.767 --> 23:31.965
You realize, of course,
that he's not talking to you.

23:34.995 --> 23:37.155
Tell your sweet sailor
his message will be delivered.

23:37.340 --> 23:38.796
Now what news do you have for me?

23:40.588 --> 23:43.653
If the minerals were there,
this test would be green.

23:44.020 --> 23:45.544
I took many samples.

23:50.230 --> 23:52.396
Sophie, please...

23:52.885 --> 23:56.535
don't mistake my affection
for you for weakness.

23:58.010 --> 24:00.858
It's a big island.
Keep looking!

24:09.168 --> 24:11.043
Flooding in the torpedo room is secured.

24:13.048 --> 24:14.482
Drill concluded.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.329
We shaved ten seconds off our time.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.452
If this were the real deal,
there's every likelihood

24:21.453 --> 24:22.413
we'd all still be alive.

24:22.476 --> 24:23.853
It's not time to pop champagne,

24:24.440 --> 24:26.601
but there will be ice cream
on the mess decks.

24:29.745 --> 24:30.850
Well done, Lieutenant.

24:30.997 --> 24:31.996
Thank you, sir.

24:32.232 --> 24:33.687
- Nav, take us home.
- Aye, sir.

24:33.807 --> 24:34.967
Can I help you,
Mr. Brannan?

24:36.282 --> 24:38.238
Petty Officer Brannan, step off the conn.

24:38.772 --> 24:39.959
Grenade!

24:40.644 --> 24:42.124
I'm taking control of this boat, sir.

24:42.247 --> 24:43.447
Set a course for the blockade,

24:43.448 --> 24:45.328
where you <i>will</i> surrender
to naval authorities.

24:48.406 --> 24:49.886
- You two, come with me.
- Yes, sir.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.128
- Find the COB.
- Aye, sir.

24:52.683 --> 24:54.098
Josh, take it easy, son.

24:56.925 --> 24:58.387
Everyone off this conn.

24:58.558 --> 25:00.469
I want this deck cleared now!

25:01.120 --> 25:02.600
- Helm remain stationed.
- Yes, sir.

25:02.601 --> 25:03.658
Full stop.

25:13.060 --> 25:15.650
He's threatening my boat, too.
And my men on it.

25:17.302 --> 25:18.281
Okay.

25:19.534 --> 25:21.894
Josh, I know you went through
hell when you were captured.

25:22.299 --> 25:23.939
But whatever's going through your mind...

25:23.940 --> 25:25.533
Don't take another step.

25:26.114 --> 25:27.332
I'm standing right here.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.600
Whatever's going
through your mind right now,

25:30.823 --> 25:32.270
this is not the answer.

25:32.392 --> 25:33.658
They're calling us traitors.

25:34.552 --> 25:36.083
Everyone thinks I'm a coward.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.161
No one thinks that, son.

25:37.252 --> 25:39.681
I'm taking back this boat
and returning it to my country,

25:39.830 --> 25:41.612
or I will die on the bottom with it.

25:42.088 --> 25:44.180
Either way, somebody's
gonna call me a hero.

25:45.646 --> 25:46.966
You know, I don't think you and I

25:47.088 --> 25:48.393
are that far apart, really.

25:48.527 --> 25:49.937
We couldn't be farther apart, sir.

25:50.053 --> 25:52.579
Really? What are you
doing right now?

25:53.004 --> 25:55.167
You're standing up to authority.

25:55.378 --> 25:56.857
Let's go.

25:57.216 --> 25:58.936
No, XO, you can't do this.
He's messed up.

25:59.063 --> 26:01.143
He's not thinking straight.
We can't just kill him.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.455
- He's one of us.
- That grenade goes off on the conn,

26:03.456 --> 26:04.936
we lose the controls, we're all dead.

26:04.937 --> 26:06.241
Don't...

26:06.242 --> 26:08.402
Hey, I want to get him out
of there as safe as I can,

26:08.403 --> 26:09.843
but he has taken it out of my hands.

26:13.658 --> 26:15.509
Our country was founded in protest,

26:15.641 --> 26:18.208
under the moral obligation
to stand up to authority

26:18.329 --> 26:20.529
when it acts against the best
interests of our nation.

26:20.650 --> 26:22.037
I swore to defend my nation!

26:22.157 --> 26:24.678
No, you swore to support and defend

26:24.808 --> 26:26.540
the constitution of the United States

26:26.664 --> 26:28.880
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.953
<i>That</i> is how you defend your nation.

26:31.081 --> 26:32.848
You disobeyed a direct order.

26:33.509 --> 26:36.772
You stole a nuclear submarine
a-and fired on our country!

26:37.378 --> 26:39.689
I guess it sounds pretty bad
when you put it like that.

26:40.882 --> 26:42.562
They tried to kill us, Josh.

26:42.682 --> 26:44.002
And if we hadn't fired that nuke,

26:44.003 --> 26:45.043
they would have succeeded.

26:45.110 --> 26:46.534
Now, I grant you,

26:47.249 --> 26:48.568
it's pretty damn hard to fathom

26:48.690 --> 26:52.158
what's right or wrong here,
but we do need to decide.

26:53.217 --> 26:56.049
What do duty and honor dictate we do?

26:57.052 --> 27:00.579
How do we best uphold the oath we took?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.840
Now I've answered
those questions for myself,

27:02.926 --> 27:04.626
but you need to decide, Josh.

27:05.250 --> 27:08.266
Everyone on this crew needs to <i>decide.</i>

27:08.688 --> 27:09.808
That's why there's a list...

27:09.809 --> 27:11.032
<i>up on the mess decks.</i>

27:11.161 --> 27:12.535
<i>It's not stay or go.</i>

27:12.658 --> 27:13.808
It's a declaration.

27:16.414 --> 27:19.213
What do you <i>really</i> stand for?

27:22.158 --> 27:23.518
It's okay if you want to sit down.

27:23.519 --> 27:26.230
No. You... you're twisting
everything up.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.706
I-I just wanted to be
in the Navy

27:28.707 --> 27:30.307
I saw in the damn commercials, you know?

27:30.387 --> 27:32.550
- That's all I ever wanted.
- Look, Josh, I get it.

27:33.006 --> 27:35.421
When I was a kid, we moved
to a pretty rough town.

27:36.199 --> 27:38.738
But there was always the chesapeake.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.811
And I'd look out there
and I'd see those ships.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.288
And I knew...

27:42.650 --> 27:44.502
that was my way out.

27:45.321 --> 27:47.774
The Navy saw more in me
than I saw in myself.

27:47.913 --> 27:49.268
Gave me everything I have,

27:49.408 --> 27:52.325
<i>made</i> me into the man I am today.

27:52.799 --> 27:54.909
So what I've done, the choice I've made...

27:55.940 --> 27:57.962
It's like I've betrayed my brother.

27:59.420 --> 28:01.230
But it's the only choice I had.

28:01.367 --> 28:02.822
No, it wasn't.

28:04.438 --> 28:06.290
You didn't have to choose that.

28:06.410 --> 28:07.705
You didn't.

28:10.260 --> 28:13.300
Josh, what's going on, man?
Talk to me.

28:15.322 --> 28:16.860
God.

28:17.631 --> 28:19.027
It's my fault.

28:21.822 --> 28:23.062
I did it.

28:24.381 --> 28:26.778
And he's dead because of me.

28:28.955 --> 28:30.258
You talking about Red?

28:30.381 --> 28:32.049
Don't come near me!
I swear to God!

28:32.172 --> 28:34.052
Brannan, hold out the grenade
and do not move!

28:34.097 --> 28:36.386
Just get back, damn it!
Stand down! Stand down!

28:36.494 --> 28:37.552
The pin's out!

28:41.992 --> 28:43.223
Lower your weapon.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.225
I want to speak to Curry.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.004
I want to talk
to the Secretary of Defense.

28:55.038 --> 28:56.875
XO, open the channel.

28:58.715 --> 29:00.355
Petty Officer Brannan would like to speak

29:00.356 --> 29:01.875
to the Secretary of Defense.

29:02.072 --> 29:05.344
And that's just what we're gonna do.

29:05.984 --> 29:08.082
Stay with me, Josh.
We're almost there.

29:08.197 --> 29:09.437
How we doing on that call, Sam?

29:09.438 --> 29:12.129
- It's coming online now.
- Put it on the speakers.

29:16.653 --> 29:18.733
This is Secretary of Defense Curry.

29:18.852 --> 29:19.981
Who am I speaking with?

29:20.096 --> 29:21.293
This is Marcus, Bill.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.622
I'm here with Petty Officer Josh Brannan,

29:23.747 --> 29:25.305
who has taken control of the boat.

29:27.102 --> 29:28.942
Sir, I'm taking the boat
out to the blockade.

29:28.943 --> 29:30.187
I request instructions.

29:30.298 --> 29:31.811
What's your current situation?

29:32.627 --> 29:35.259
I'm on the conn.
I have a grenade.

29:35.379 --> 29:37.748
Are you acting alone?
Is there resistance?

29:37.856 --> 29:39.028
I'm alone.

29:39.704 --> 29:41.104
There's an armed party on the conn,

29:41.105 --> 29:42.694
but my grenade is live.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.940
Sir, what are my orders?

29:51.103 --> 29:52.792
You're four hours out from the blockade.

29:52.877 --> 29:55.962
It's too far. You'll never
hold them off that long.

30:01.178 --> 30:03.744
What do you want me
to do... sir?

30:04.261 --> 30:06.972
- Blow it. Sink the boat.
- Lower your weapons.

30:07.487 --> 30:08.887
<i>Mr. Brannan,</i>
<i>I want you to confirm</i>

30:08.888 --> 30:10.352
<i>that you have heard your orders.</i>

30:10.675 --> 30:13.741
Yes, sir, I heard you.
Sink the boat.

30:18.004 --> 30:20.863
Josh, there are 120 souls
on this boat right now.

30:21.569 --> 30:24.401
Curry and the others want this
whole mess to just go away.

30:24.608 --> 30:26.568
They want to bury it
at the bottom of the ocean.

30:26.715 --> 30:27.977
Our mere presence

30:28.121 --> 30:30.444
is forcing hard questions
to be asked back home.

30:31.217 --> 30:35.192
I am trying to bring
the truth out into light.

30:36.657 --> 30:38.178
But I need your help.

31:21.514 --> 31:22.965
Ship is secure.

31:23.381 --> 31:26.057
I can't help you anymore,
Admiral Shepard. I'm sorry.

31:26.917 --> 31:28.173
Why the change of heart?

31:28.549 --> 31:29.992
I'm taking the long view.

31:30.504 --> 31:32.252
Yeah? Which is what?

31:33.524 --> 31:34.728
The US under martial law,

31:34.867 --> 31:37.211
with you sitting
on a Hamptons throne somewhere

31:37.325 --> 31:38.747
letting the peasants eat cake?

31:38.868 --> 31:40.053
Yeah. Maybe.

31:40.270 --> 31:42.190
Look, you could have
told me this on the phone.

31:42.340 --> 31:45.142
- Why are you here?
- The order. 998.

31:45.257 --> 31:47.665
It doesn't exist.
It's wiped clean.

31:54.239 --> 31:55.277
Okay.

31:56.112 --> 31:58.854
If they're worried Chaplin
is gonna use my prototype

31:58.974 --> 32:00.681
against them, who better to figure out

32:00.800 --> 32:04.002
how to help them defeat it
than the people who made it?

32:04.444 --> 32:08.421
Instead, the president
personally called my father,

32:08.583 --> 32:09.787
had him get my boyfriend

32:09.918 --> 32:12.167
to steal the Perseus drive from me.

32:13.929 --> 32:16.014
There's a gyroscopic positioning system

32:16.133 --> 32:17.836
built into the prototype.

32:17.967 --> 32:18.941
It began tracking data

32:19.063 --> 32:21.061
the minute the Colorado left port.

32:21.488 --> 32:22.930
But when Chaplin tested it,

32:23.112 --> 32:25.050
it transmitted all that data back home

32:25.158 --> 32:26.394
just like it was supposed to,

32:26.538 --> 32:29.734
which is now also on that drive.

32:29.849 --> 32:31.929
They didn't want you to know
where the Colorado was

32:31.930 --> 32:33.730
- when it was attacked.
- No, that's not it.

32:34.099 --> 32:36.271
They don't want anyone to know
where the Colorado was

32:36.426 --> 32:38.236
<i>before</i> the attack.

32:39.886 --> 32:41.468
I've been asked to attend a meeting

32:41.599 --> 32:43.091
at the Pentagon tomorrow.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.088
What for?

32:44.213 --> 32:46.107
Well, they won't say, but it's a...

32:46.261 --> 32:49.621
It's a meeting with the new
Secretary of Defense... Curry.

32:50.842 --> 32:51.856
Just so you know,

32:52.004 --> 32:54.063
I'm not allergic to shellfish, either.

33:02.865 --> 33:03.657
Thanks.

33:05.906 --> 33:07.580
Well, look at you two all dressed up.

33:07.751 --> 33:09.620
Hey, it's been fun, man,
but it's time to go.

33:09.739 --> 33:11.995
- We have a boat.
- Let's grab Gil's body and Hopper,

33:12.116 --> 33:13.363
and get the hell out of dodge.

33:14.696 --> 33:16.492
No, Hopper can't travel yet.
No way.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.068
Better odds than staying here, man.

33:18.185 --> 33:20.385
Yeah? 'Cause you know what's
waiting for us back home?

33:20.488 --> 33:23.248
- 'Cause I sure as hell don't.
- Half their crew's about to bug out.

33:24.062 --> 33:26.038
Fine. We'll grab Gil
and be out of your way.

33:26.157 --> 33:27.486
No. You won't.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.967
I did three tours with Gil.
We went through buds together.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.703
We made each other promises.

33:34.705 --> 33:36.040
He stays with me.

33:39.198 --> 33:40.868
Take this outside my bar!

33:44.789 --> 33:46.424
You're paying for the damage.

33:53.089 --> 33:54.495
Don't get up.

34:14.070 --> 34:15.119
Hell with it.

34:28.512 --> 34:30.781
<i>Much of the area is still underwater</i>

34:30.909 --> 34:32.652
<i>in the wake of the late September deluge.</i>

34:32.991 --> 34:35.264
<i>2,500 homes have been flooded...</i>

34:35.909 --> 34:37.058
Hey.

34:37.670 --> 34:38.829
You fell asleep.

34:39.025 --> 34:41.610
Yeah.

34:42.965 --> 34:44.683
You feeling better about all this?

34:44.860 --> 34:46.187
Yeah.

34:46.531 --> 34:47.855
Screw 'em, right?

34:47.969 --> 34:50.731
You worked very hard on Perseus.

34:53.373 --> 34:55.036
I'm very proud of you.

34:55.167 --> 34:56.692
But the game has grown.

34:56.831 --> 34:59.167
The stakes are out of your league.

35:02.098 --> 35:03.629
Get yourself to bed.

35:04.417 --> 35:05.581
<i>...met by mostly cheers</i>

35:05.702 --> 35:06.927
<i>across the country today,</i>

35:07.186 --> 35:10.513
<i>but Christine Kendal, wife of</i>
<i>nuclear submarine XO,</i>

35:10.647 --> 35:13.781
<i>lashed out at reporters tonight</i>
<i>in front of her Maryland home.</i>

35:13.888 --> 35:15.191
<i>Why are you watching me?!</i>

35:15.308 --> 35:17.818
<i>Why are you lying about</i>
<i>my husband, you cowards?!</i>

35:17.926 --> 35:19.355
<i>The government detained me!</i>

35:19.486 --> 35:22.004
<i>They are lying about what</i>
<i>happened to the Colorado!</i>

35:22.142 --> 35:25.892
<i>I am a US citizen,</i>
<i>and I will not be silenced!</i>

35:26.009 --> 35:28.754
<i>I want the truth, and you should, too!</i>

35:31.933 --> 35:32.939
Enter.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.840
No, leave it open, please.

35:44.906 --> 35:46.218
Sir...

35:46.730 --> 35:48.748
I have to talk to you about Josh.

35:48.876 --> 35:50.393
What we went through with Red.

35:51.353 --> 35:52.737
I'm listening.

35:55.479 --> 35:56.959
It wasn't like we said.

35:57.081 --> 35:59.450
Serrat made us choose who would die.

35:59.561 --> 36:01.283
He asked me first, and I wouldn't do it.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.146
Then he put his gun on Josh.

36:03.303 --> 36:04.722
He picked Red.

36:05.145 --> 36:07.448
If he hadn't, it would have
been all three of us.

36:08.439 --> 36:10.756
Red was screaming
right up until the gunshots.

36:11.759 --> 36:15.394
So you let a time bomb fester on my boat.

36:15.708 --> 36:16.890
I was worried about him...

36:17.018 --> 36:18.469
What the crew would think of him.

36:33.117 --> 36:34.531
It's a nice spot.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.600
In the morning, the local girls come down,

36:38.601 --> 36:40.066
they dive for oysters.

36:41.084 --> 36:42.925
Brown skin, bikini tops.

36:44.575 --> 36:46.288
It's a damn fine
"Good morning."

36:48.663 --> 36:50.823
Don't think you'll tire of that too soon.

36:52.398 --> 36:53.513
And when the sun gets low,

36:55.157 --> 36:56.730
it lights up the water all pink.

36:58.095 --> 37:00.679
Ah, it's just... spectacular.

37:18.456 --> 37:20.125
It ain't Arlington, though.

37:24.127 --> 37:25.837
You deserve Arlington.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.409
You won back a lot of hearts
and minds today, sir.

37:44.644 --> 37:46.284
Still, we're losing a lot of good people.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.696
Maybe if I'd made a better speech.

37:52.344 --> 37:54.624
XO, please speak with our engineer.

37:54.899 --> 37:56.545
Yeah.

38:01.104 --> 38:02.736
My name's been moved.

38:03.610 --> 38:04.775
Guess I'm not going anywhere.

38:04.897 --> 38:07.247
You were right. You're too
important to let go, Anders.

38:07.378 --> 38:09.131
So for now, you're stuck with us.

38:09.378 --> 38:12.085
The Captain and I both
appreciate your service.

38:23.114 --> 38:25.421
You're lucky you didn't break anything.

38:25.543 --> 38:29.229
- I bend, I don't break.
- Right.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.144
Tough guy.-...

38:31.923 --> 38:33.683
This could really use a stitch.

38:33.794 --> 38:36.292
I know. Don't bother.
It's gonna scar up nice.

38:40.239 --> 38:42.316
You loved him, didn't you?

38:42.906 --> 38:44.847
That's why you fought for him.

38:49.416 --> 38:51.092
He was my brother.

39:41.456 --> 39:42.827
Wow.

39:44.620 --> 39:48.285
I wanted you to see this
so you would understand.

39:50.282 --> 39:52.526
For centuries, this island wasn't...

39:52.642 --> 39:54.332
wasn't noticed by the world.

39:54.719 --> 39:58.048
No wealth, no importance.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.416
So it was allowed to remain beautiful.

40:01.554 --> 40:03.314
I guess we changed
things a bit, didn't we?

40:07.686 --> 40:10.177
You are the power on this island now.

40:11.806 --> 40:14.042
So you have the responsibility

40:14.282 --> 40:15.422
to care for it.

40:19.025 --> 40:23.207
If, something were to happen to me...

40:23.327 --> 40:25.567
What are you talking about?
What's gonna happen to you?

40:25.972 --> 40:27.563
Look at it.

40:27.744 --> 40:28.877
It's magical.

40:29.002 --> 40:30.723
And it's yours now.

40:31.209 --> 40:33.231
Whether you want it or not.

40:33.645 --> 40:35.605
Listen, I'm sorry,
but I don't want to be here.

40:35.707 --> 40:37.475
<i>Oui, je sais.</i>

40:37.589 --> 40:39.124
I know.

40:39.502 --> 40:41.856
You're like me when I first arrived.

40:42.386 --> 40:44.319
This place was exile.

40:45.238 --> 40:47.015
But not anymore.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.320
There are things here

40:52.452 --> 40:55.126
worth more than you can ever imagine.
