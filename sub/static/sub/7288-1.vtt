00:19.034 --> 00:22.003
- Come, come to me,

00:22.037 --> 00:23.505
mi hijo.

00:37.887 --> 00:40.555
- Tiffani, you are crying.

00:40.589 --> 00:42.891
Why, my darling?

00:42.925 --> 00:44.458
- Oh, Ernesto,

00:44.493 --> 00:46.394
it's just I've been

00:46.428 --> 00:48.396
with so many men.

00:48.430 --> 00:50.398
- Have there been many?

00:50.432 --> 00:51.900
- No.

00:51.934 --> 00:53.401
- It will not matter

00:53.435 --> 00:54.903
if you have been

00:54.937 --> 00:56.237
with millions of men.

00:56.271 --> 00:57.572
- Well,

00:57.606 --> 00:59.073
you're getting warm.

00:59.107 --> 01:01.075
With other men it's just sex.

01:01.109 --> 01:02.744
Random trashy sex

01:02.778 --> 01:05.413
that goes on for days.

01:05.447 --> 01:07.415
But with you,

01:07.449 --> 01:09.584
I will finally make love.

01:17.459 --> 01:19.427
Oh, Ernesto,

01:19.461 --> 01:21.429
I totally love you.

01:21.463 --> 01:23.431
- I want to make

01:23.465 --> 01:26.601
many children.

01:26.635 --> 01:29.771
- Yes, children.

01:29.805 --> 01:33.441
Put children in me now!

01:33.475 --> 01:36.778
Fuck me now!

01:36.812 --> 01:39.113
Harder, Ernesto, come on.

01:39.147 --> 01:41.783
Oh, yes, fuck me

01:41.817 --> 01:43.284
like a day laborer.

01:43.318 --> 01:44.786
Yeah, baby,

01:44.820 --> 01:46.287
take me from behind.

01:46.321 --> 01:48.122
Use me, treat me

01:48.156 --> 01:49.958
like a fuck machine.

01:49.992 --> 01:51.960
Rarrr, rarrr, rarrr!

01:51.994 --> 01:53.461
- In the butt?

01:53.495 --> 01:55.196
- Yes, in the butt, now.

01:55.230 --> 01:56.530
- Tiffani, we must stop.

01:56.565 --> 01:57.865
- If you stop

01:57.900 --> 01:59.200
I'll rip off your dick

01:59.234 --> 02:00.702
and shove it in there myself.

02:00.736 --> 02:01.869
- Tiffani,

02:01.904 --> 02:03.204
we're in a coffin.

02:03.238 --> 02:04.538
- Shut up,

02:04.573 --> 02:06.040
you're ruining my fantasy.

02:06.075 --> 02:07.541
- Tiffani.

02:07.576 --> 02:09.043
- Shit, my speech.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.748
Gracias, Ernesto.

02:15.851 --> 02:17.652
I love funerals.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.907
- Kyle and Mark loved life,

02:39.942 --> 02:41.408
and that's why

02:41.443 --> 02:44.078
we're here today.

02:44.113 --> 02:46.080
My son was so proud

02:46.115 --> 02:48.082
of his homosexuality

02:48.117 --> 02:50.084
that he would want you all

02:50.119 --> 02:52.419
to know exactly how he died.

02:52.454 --> 02:54.421
My son rocketed off

02:54.456 --> 02:56.157
this mortal coil

02:56.191 --> 02:58.159
at 80 miles an hour

02:58.193 --> 02:59.894
down the Ronald Regan freeway

02:59.928 --> 03:01.796
while giving the man he loved

03:01.830 --> 03:03.531
a blowjob.

03:03.565 --> 03:05.033
According

03:05.067 --> 03:08.903
to the autopsy report,

03:08.937 --> 03:13.107
as Mark began to bust a nut,

03:13.142 --> 03:15.442
Celine Dion's tour bus appeared

03:15.477 --> 03:17.444
going in the wrong direction.

03:17.479 --> 03:19.446
Upon impact,

03:19.481 --> 03:22.950
my boys came together.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.952
And they died together,

03:24.987 --> 03:27.288
doing what they loved.

03:29.158 --> 03:30.624
Amen.

03:34.663 --> 03:36.630
Kyle's best friend,

03:36.665 --> 03:38.632
Tiffani Vanderslut,

03:38.667 --> 03:41.302
has prepared a special tribute.

03:41.336 --> 03:43.037
- I wouldn't call us

03:43.072 --> 03:44.706
best friends exactly.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.790
This number goes out to you,

04:02.825 --> 04:05.793
Kyle and Mark.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.462
Kinda sucks they're dead, huh?

04:08.496 --> 04:10.297
I remember the time

04:10.332 --> 04:11.966
Kyle pretended to be straight

04:12.000 --> 04:14.468
for my ex boyfriend, Troy,

04:14.502 --> 04:16.637
who made him eat my pussy.

04:16.671 --> 04:18.639
And then everything went...

04:21.176 --> 04:22.877
Well, maybe that's not

04:22.911 --> 04:25.713
an appropriate memory.

04:25.748 --> 04:27.381
And Mark.

04:27.415 --> 04:29.383
Actually I hardly knew you

04:29.417 --> 04:30.885
but whatever,

04:30.919 --> 04:32.220
thanks for coming.

04:36.424 --> 04:38.126
Here's a little diddy

04:38.160 --> 04:40.795
I learned in Girl Scouts.

04:40.829 --> 04:43.430
I had to look up the lyrics

04:43.465 --> 04:44.999
online.

04:55.510 --> 04:59.881
# Cum-ba-ya, my lord, #

04:59.915 --> 05:02.950
# cum-by-ya. #

05:02.985 --> 05:06.654
# Cum-ba-ya, my lord, #

05:06.688 --> 05:10.124
# cum-by-ya. #

05:11.894 --> 05:15.163
# Cum-ba-ya, my lord, #

05:15.197 --> 05:18.599
# cum-by-ya. #

05:18.633 --> 05:24.605
# Oh lord, cum-by-ya. #

05:24.639 --> 05:28.242
# Someone's praying, my lord, #

05:28.277 --> 05:30.878
# cum-by-ya. #

05:30.913 --> 05:33.848
# Someone's praying, my lord, #

05:33.882 --> 05:36.050
# cum-by-ya. #

05:36.084 --> 05:38.920
# Someone's praying, my lord, #

05:38.954 --> 05:41.122
# cum-by-ya. #

05:41.156 --> 05:44.558
# Oh lord, cum-by-ya. #

05:44.592 --> 05:47.561
# Someone's praying, my lord, #

05:47.595 --> 05:49.230
# cum-by-ya. #

05:49.264 --> 05:50.965
# Someone's squirming, #

05:50.999 --> 05:52.700
# my lord, #

05:52.734 --> 05:54.368
# cum-by-ya. #

05:54.402 --> 05:56.370
# Someone's horny, my lord, #

05:56.404 --> 05:58.105
# cum-by-ya. #

05:58.140 --> 06:01.876
# Oh yes, my lord! #

06:01.910 --> 06:04.045
# Cum-by-ya. #

06:04.246 --> 06:06.714
Oh, God, it's so hard,

06:06.748 --> 06:09.050
I just need to...

06:09.084 --> 06:10.718
pray.

06:19.661 --> 06:20.962
- Lord,

06:20.996 --> 06:22.296
hear our prayer.

06:22.331 --> 06:23.630
- I'm gonna love

06:23.665 --> 06:24.966
this town.

06:33.508 --> 06:34.808
- It isn't much,

06:34.843 --> 06:36.143
but I can give you

06:36.178 --> 06:37.478
a good deal on the rent.

06:37.512 --> 06:38.645
- It's perfection.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.981
- You haven't seen it.

06:40.015 --> 06:41.315
- It's near my Aunt,

06:41.350 --> 06:42.649
what more could I want?

06:42.684 --> 06:44.151
- Well, it is furnished

06:44.186 --> 06:45.652
and it'll be nice

06:45.687 --> 06:47.154
to have family around.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.655
- Thank you, Aunt Helen.

06:50.859 --> 06:52.659
- I just wish you and Kyle

06:52.694 --> 06:53.995
could've spent

06:54.029 --> 06:55.496
more time together.

06:55.530 --> 06:57.498
Did he know you were a mo?

06:57.532 --> 06:58.832
- Uh...

06:58.867 --> 07:00.834
I didn't know I was a mo

07:00.869 --> 07:02.503
until like a year ago.

07:02.537 --> 07:04.005
- Color me, Britney.

07:04.039 --> 07:05.672
I always thought you were gayer

07:05.707 --> 07:07.174
than a midnight screening

07:07.209 --> 07:08.342
of Showgirls.

07:08.377 --> 07:09.510
- I was

07:09.544 --> 07:10.844
one of those clueless gays.

07:10.879 --> 07:12.013
Everyone knew but me.

07:12.047 --> 07:13.347
- So when did you finally

07:13.382 --> 07:14.515
get your man-cherry popped?

07:14.549 --> 07:15.682
- Aunt Helen!

07:15.717 --> 07:17.184
You don't wanna hear about that.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.519
- Of course I do.

07:18.553 --> 07:20.021
I wouldn't be a good aunt

07:20.055 --> 07:21.289
if I didn't.

07:24.326 --> 07:25.626
- 696? Is that local?

07:25.660 --> 07:27.361
- Well, I gave your number

07:27.396 --> 07:28.529
to that slut

07:28.563 --> 07:29.863
from the funeral, Tiffani.

07:29.898 --> 07:31.365
- Oh, I love her.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.699
- Kyle adored her.

07:32.734 --> 07:34.435
And, well, I thought

07:34.469 --> 07:36.703
you might need some new friends,

07:36.738 --> 07:38.739
even if they are loser whores.

07:38.941 --> 07:40.074
- Hello?

07:40.108 --> 07:41.242
- Casey, Casey.

07:41.276 --> 07:42.410
- Hey, Tiffani.

07:42.444 --> 07:43.744
- How did you know

07:43.778 --> 07:44.912
it was me?

07:44.947 --> 07:46.080
- I remembered

07:46.114 --> 07:47.248
your sultry voice

07:47.282 --> 07:48.416
form the funeral.

07:48.450 --> 07:49.417
- Compliments

07:49.451 --> 07:50.584
will get you nowhere

07:50.618 --> 07:51.752
unless you're straight.

07:51.786 --> 07:53.087
And hung like Mr. T.

07:53.121 --> 07:54.255
- Damn and damn.

07:54.289 --> 07:55.423
- As I thought.

07:55.457 --> 07:56.590
Your aunt tells me

07:56.624 --> 07:57.758
you need a job,

07:57.792 --> 07:58.926
why don't you get

07:58.961 --> 08:00.094
your faggoty ass

08:00.128 --> 08:01.429
down to 4255 Hawthorne Lane.

08:01.463 --> 08:02.763
- You are such a stud.

08:02.797 --> 08:03.931
- I know.

08:03.966 --> 08:05.099
Fuff!

08:05.133 --> 08:06.434
Where have you been

08:06.468 --> 08:07.935
sticking these things?

08:08.636 --> 08:10.204
- Oh!

08:10.238 --> 08:11.538
- Go on,

08:11.573 --> 08:13.040
go get your tramp on.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.375
- Thank you, Aunt Helen.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.318
- I am the coolest adult

08:24.353 --> 08:25.819
in the world.

08:31.693 --> 08:37.831
Oh, Kyle...

08:37.866 --> 08:39.500
My little queen.

08:54.883 --> 08:56.850
- Nail Me, we do nails.

08:56.885 --> 08:58.685
With release!

09:00.222 --> 09:02.189
No, I'm kidding, I mean,

09:02.224 --> 09:03.924
unless you're a really hot guy.

09:03.958 --> 09:05.426
Are you?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.428
Well, I'm sorry you don't find

09:07.462 --> 09:08.929
my brand of humor...

09:10.632 --> 09:11.932
Well, I'm sorry I offended

09:11.966 --> 09:13.100
your Christian sensibility,

09:13.135 --> 09:14.768
but if you worship a guy

09:14.802 --> 09:16.270
who was hung on a cross,

09:16.304 --> 09:17.604
nails should be the last thing

09:17.639 --> 09:18.939
on your mind.

09:19.974 --> 09:21.275
Who needs customer

09:21.309 --> 09:22.876
like her anyway.

09:29.084 --> 09:30.551
- Let me introduce you

09:30.585 --> 09:31.885
to the girls.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.555
Pam, Candy.

09:53.942 --> 09:55.409
- They said they can't wait

09:55.444 --> 09:56.743
to get to know you.

09:56.778 --> 09:57.911
- Cool.

09:57.946 --> 09:59.413
Tell them I feel the same way.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.592
- Basically, you sweep up,

10:11.626 --> 10:12.926
take phone calls

10:12.961 --> 10:14.428
and do whatever we say.

10:14.463 --> 10:15.929
Can you handle that?

10:15.964 --> 10:17.664
- Is Madonna awesome?

10:18.866 --> 10:20.167
- Okay.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.668
Well the job's yours anyway,

10:21.703 --> 10:23.270
but there's one little catch.

10:23.305 --> 10:25.005
You have to come with me

10:25.039 --> 10:26.173
to this event thingy.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.508
- I love event thingies.

10:27.542 --> 10:28.842
- You try too hard.

10:28.876 --> 10:30.010
Come on.

10:30.044 --> 10:31.178
- Right now?

10:31.213 --> 10:32.346
What about work?

10:32.380 --> 10:33.514
- Fuck them.

10:33.548 --> 10:35.616
- Fuck you, too.

10:38.487 --> 10:39.954
- What are we doing here?

10:39.988 --> 10:41.456
I don't like places like this.

10:41.490 --> 10:42.457
- Me neither,

10:42.491 --> 10:43.791
but they have this fundraiser

10:43.826 --> 10:45.125
where they auction off dates

10:45.160 --> 10:46.461
with shirtless beefcakes.

10:46.495 --> 10:47.795
Nudity and open bar.

10:47.830 --> 10:49.296
- You're taking me to that?!

10:49.331 --> 10:50.798
- No, it's in two weeks.

10:50.833 --> 10:51.966
And you're taking me.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.133
Kyle was going to,

10:53.168 --> 10:54.469
but, you know, he's dead.

10:54.503 --> 10:55.803
So you're going to volunteer

10:55.838 --> 10:57.137
and get us free tickets.

10:57.172 --> 10:58.473
- But I'm so not

10:58.507 --> 10:59.640
a hot shirtless man.

10:59.675 --> 11:00.975
- You're hardly a man,

11:01.009 --> 11:02.477
no one would pay for you,

11:02.511 --> 11:03.478
you'll help out

11:03.512 --> 11:04.479
behind the scenes.

11:04.513 --> 11:05.980
- Why would I do that?

11:06.014 --> 11:07.482
- I gave you that job

11:07.516 --> 11:08.816
and I can replace you

11:08.851 --> 11:10.150
with an immigrant, like that!

11:10.185 --> 11:11.151
- Okay, okay,

11:11.186 --> 11:12.487
it's just that I'm not

11:12.521 --> 11:13.821
into the whole gay scene.

11:13.856 --> 11:14.822
- Welcome

11:14.857 --> 11:16.156
to the whole gay scene.

11:16.191 --> 11:17.492
Are you kids here

11:17.526 --> 11:18.659
to volunteer?

11:18.694 --> 11:20.495
- I'm not but Casey is.

11:20.529 --> 11:22.096
- Fabulous.

11:22.130 --> 11:23.764
Darling, you're shaking

11:23.799 --> 11:25.766
like a little Chihuahua.

11:25.801 --> 11:27.602
Don't be nervous,

11:27.636 --> 11:29.537
I don't bite...much.

11:31.573 --> 11:32.707
- He's never volunteered

11:32.741 --> 11:33.708
before.

11:33.742 --> 11:34.876
- Oh, a virgin.

11:34.910 --> 11:36.210
- If you don't count

11:36.244 --> 11:37.211
anal.

11:37.245 --> 11:38.379
- Well, either way,

11:38.413 --> 11:39.547
fill out this paperwork

11:39.581 --> 11:40.882
and then I'll have Zack,

11:40.916 --> 11:42.316
our volunteer coordinator,

11:42.350 --> 11:43.985
meet with you and figure out

11:44.019 --> 11:45.319
which position

11:45.353 --> 11:47.488
you'd be most comfortable in.

11:47.523 --> 11:49.490
So to speak.

11:50.025 --> 11:50.992
- That's why

11:51.026 --> 11:52.326
I don't like these places.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.494
They're full of these

11:53.529 --> 11:54.495
old horn dogs

11:54.530 --> 11:55.663
looking to get laid.

11:55.697 --> 11:56.664
- Jesus.

11:56.698 --> 11:57.999
Lay off the fox news.

11:58.033 --> 11:59.333
- Really, I always hear

11:59.367 --> 12:00.501
'the gay community' this,

12:00.536 --> 12:01.669
the 'gay community' that.

12:01.703 --> 12:03.170
But all I see are a bunch

12:03.204 --> 12:04.171
of drunk assholes

12:04.205 --> 12:05.172
looking for sex,

12:05.206 --> 12:06.340
who don't care anything

12:06.374 --> 12:07.341
about relationships.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.342
- Excuse me,

12:08.376 --> 12:09.510
Maria full of grace,

12:09.545 --> 12:10.678
but that doesn't sound

12:10.712 --> 12:11.846
any different

12:11.880 --> 12:13.180
than any straight bar.

12:13.214 --> 12:14.849
Drunk sweaty men.

12:14.883 --> 12:16.350
Drooling, groping,

12:16.384 --> 12:18.352
pressing their manhood

12:18.386 --> 12:19.687
all up against

12:19.721 --> 12:20.855
your supple ass

12:20.889 --> 12:22.189
on the dance floor.

12:22.223 --> 12:23.691
- God, you are gayer

12:23.725 --> 12:24.859
than I am.

12:24.893 --> 12:26.193
- Honey, I'm gayer

12:26.227 --> 12:27.528
than a Kevin Spacey

12:27.563 --> 12:28.696
Anderson Cooper chicken wrap,

12:28.730 --> 12:30.031
and what's wrong with that?

12:30.065 --> 12:31.532
- Nothing, it's just

12:31.567 --> 12:32.533
I'm disappointed

12:32.568 --> 12:33.701
at how sex-centric

12:33.735 --> 12:35.202
the gay community is.

12:35.236 --> 12:36.537
- It's called homosexual,

12:36.572 --> 12:37.872
not homo-hug-ual,

12:37.906 --> 12:39.040
what did you expect?

12:39.074 --> 12:40.207
- Romance?

12:40.241 --> 12:41.943
I want to travel the world

12:41.977 --> 12:43.277
on scooters, adopt children.

12:43.311 --> 12:44.278
- Children

12:44.312 --> 12:45.613
are just abortions that eat.

12:45.647 --> 12:46.781
- You know what?

12:46.815 --> 12:48.515
Forget it, I am not signing

12:48.550 --> 12:50.051
that stupid...

12:51.419 --> 12:53.387
Oh, my fuck.

13:08.436 --> 13:09.737
- I see you got

13:09.771 --> 13:10.905
your paperwork.

13:10.939 --> 13:12.073
- Uh, yeah...

13:12.107 --> 13:13.407
just let me sign it.

13:15.110 --> 13:16.911
- Cool.

13:16.945 --> 13:18.079
Jonathan?

13:18.113 --> 13:19.446
- Uh, Casey.

13:19.481 --> 13:20.948
- Oh, I'm Zack.

13:20.983 --> 13:22.449
This is Tandy.

13:22.484 --> 13:23.784
- I'm his best friend.

13:23.819 --> 13:24.952
- That's so funny,

13:24.987 --> 13:26.621
I'm here with my best friend,

13:26.655 --> 13:27.788
Tiffani.

13:27.823 --> 13:29.289
- No, I'm more like

13:29.324 --> 13:30.457
your boss.

13:30.492 --> 13:31.626
- Wow, best friends

13:31.660 --> 13:32.793
with T names.

13:32.828 --> 13:34.294
- Yeah, we should like

13:34.329 --> 13:35.462
form a club.

13:35.497 --> 13:36.631
- Excuse me,

13:36.665 --> 13:38.966
I gotta go take a shit.

13:39.001 --> 13:40.701
- I'll come with.

13:42.570 --> 13:43.704
- So you're comfortable

13:43.739 --> 13:44.872
taking off your clothes?

13:44.906 --> 13:45.873
- What?

13:45.907 --> 13:47.207
- Oh, I just assumed

13:47.242 --> 13:48.208
you were volunteering

13:48.243 --> 13:49.543
to be one of the studs

13:49.577 --> 13:50.711
in the male sale.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.212
- I'm clearly not a...

13:52.247 --> 13:53.714
stud.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.716
Are you a...a stud?

13:55.751 --> 13:57.217
I mean in the male sale?

13:57.252 --> 13:58.719
- Yes, I'm in the auction.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.054
But I sorta do

14:00.088 --> 14:01.722
everything around here.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.391
- So, wow, how'd you get

14:04.425 --> 14:05.893
into volunteering?

14:05.927 --> 14:07.394
- I'm running credit

14:07.428 --> 14:08.896
for this faggotry studies class

14:08.930 --> 14:10.230
and it's a good way

14:10.265 --> 14:11.398
to meet people.

14:11.432 --> 14:12.733
- Totally good way.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.901
- Well, they look

14:13.935 --> 14:15.069
like they're getting along.

14:15.103 --> 14:16.804
- I guess we have to pretend

14:16.838 --> 14:18.305
to like each other now.

14:18.339 --> 14:19.807
- Wow, you're really good

14:19.841 --> 14:20.975
at it.

14:21.009 --> 14:22.143
- What are some

14:22.177 --> 14:23.310
of your skills?

14:23.344 --> 14:24.311
- Huh?

14:24.345 --> 14:25.646
- Things you can do

14:25.681 --> 14:26.981
to help with the auction?

14:27.015 --> 14:28.315
Since we can't sell you.

14:28.349 --> 14:30.551
- Well...

14:30.585 --> 14:32.386
what are your skills?

14:32.420 --> 14:33.721
- Brochures, visual stuff,

14:33.755 --> 14:35.222
I'm an art major.

14:35.256 --> 14:36.557
I design all the posters here.

14:36.591 --> 14:37.892
- I can't even

14:37.926 --> 14:39.560
make a smiley on my cellphone.

14:39.594 --> 14:41.062
- Can you write?

14:41.096 --> 14:42.229
- Does texting count?

14:42.263 --> 14:43.564
- Maybe you could write

14:43.598 --> 14:44.565
the copy

14:44.599 --> 14:45.900
for one of the flyers

14:45.934 --> 14:47.068
I'm designing.

14:47.102 --> 14:48.569
We could work on it together.

14:48.603 --> 14:49.904
- I'd love to.

14:49.938 --> 14:51.405
- Can I get your number?

14:51.439 --> 14:52.406
- Really?

14:52.440 --> 14:53.908
- Yeah, you didn't write it

14:53.942 --> 14:55.076
on your form.

14:55.110 --> 14:56.410
- Oh, yeah.

14:56.444 --> 14:57.745
- Do you know

14:57.779 --> 14:58.913
the Blue Dahlia Café?

14:58.947 --> 15:00.081
- Uh, yeah.

15:00.115 --> 15:01.415
- Let's meet there tomorrow

15:01.449 --> 15:02.416
at 4:00.

15:02.450 --> 15:03.751
We'll put you to work.

15:03.785 --> 15:04.919
- Okay, well, here's

15:04.953 --> 15:06.653
my number and you can have it

15:06.688 --> 15:07.988
too, if you want to...

15:08.023 --> 15:09.156
- Zack!

15:16.531 --> 15:18.232
Can we leave this dump already?

15:18.266 --> 15:19.566
I can feel the troll

15:19.601 --> 15:20.901
sucking our youth away.

15:20.936 --> 15:22.236
- Lionel.

15:22.270 --> 15:23.570
This is my boyfriend.

15:23.605 --> 15:25.239
- Oh, great.

15:25.273 --> 15:27.074
- Me, you, talk in private.

15:27.109 --> 15:28.075
Now.

15:28.110 --> 15:29.243
- Excuse us.

15:29.277 --> 15:30.577
You didn't have to come

15:30.612 --> 15:31.912
if you're gonna be like this.

15:31.947 --> 15:33.247
- You're the one complaining

15:33.281 --> 15:34.581
we never get to spend

15:34.616 --> 15:35.582
enough time together.

15:35.617 --> 15:36.751
Well, here I am.

15:36.785 --> 15:37.918
- With your friends.

15:37.953 --> 15:38.919
- Hey.

15:38.954 --> 15:39.920
We're letting you

15:39.955 --> 15:41.655
auction us off for this dump.

15:41.689 --> 15:42.656
Be grateful.

15:42.690 --> 15:43.991
Let's get out of here.

15:44.025 --> 15:45.159
- I'm signed up

15:45.193 --> 15:46.160
for another hour.

15:46.194 --> 15:47.661
- I'll fucking cover for you.

15:47.695 --> 15:49.163
- You don't have to do that.

15:49.197 --> 15:50.664
- Oh, but I want to.

15:50.698 --> 15:51.999
Besides, fleabag here

15:52.033 --> 15:53.167
gives me a rash.

15:53.201 --> 15:54.501
- But I wasn't anywhere

15:54.535 --> 15:55.502
near your pussy.

15:55.536 --> 15:56.837
- Get him the fuck

15:56.872 --> 15:58.572
out of here.

15:58.606 --> 16:00.574
- Thanks, Tandy.

16:00.608 --> 16:02.376
See you soon, buddy.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.478
- Yeah, sounds....

16:05.847 --> 16:07.314
Like that'll happen.

16:07.348 --> 16:08.816
He's sweet, nice, and hot.

16:08.850 --> 16:10.151
Of course he's taken.

16:10.185 --> 16:11.485
- Nah, he's just

16:11.519 --> 16:12.987
ass-pussy whipped.

16:13.021 --> 16:14.488
They won't last long.

16:14.522 --> 16:15.823
"Buddy."

16:20.529 --> 16:21.662
- Don't take it

16:21.696 --> 16:22.663
so personally.

16:22.697 --> 16:23.997
- Why are we together,

16:24.032 --> 16:25.165
we don't like doing

16:25.199 --> 16:26.166
the same things.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.501
- We like doing the same.

16:27.536 --> 16:28.669
- Swallowing doesn't count.

16:28.703 --> 16:29.670
- Swallowing counts.

16:29.704 --> 16:30.671
It's extra credit.

16:30.705 --> 16:32.005
- It's been six months

16:32.040 --> 16:33.006
and I still feel

16:33.041 --> 16:34.007
you're pulling away.

16:34.042 --> 16:35.008
- Because you're always

16:35.043 --> 16:36.009
clinging on to me.

16:36.044 --> 16:37.177
- You won't even

16:37.211 --> 16:38.512
call us boyfriends in public.

16:38.547 --> 16:40.013
- You know you want me

16:40.048 --> 16:41.682
inside you.

16:41.716 --> 16:43.016
- No. I'm mad,

16:43.051 --> 16:44.685
I'm not happy

16:44.719 --> 16:46.353
with how things are going.

16:46.387 --> 16:48.355
- You're good at one thing.

16:50.224 --> 16:51.692
- Lionel.

16:51.726 --> 16:53.694
- You're great at it.

16:53.728 --> 16:55.362
- Please, don't.

17:02.236 --> 17:03.537
I can't believe

17:03.572 --> 17:05.038
I'm doing this.

17:05.073 --> 17:06.507
Please stop.

17:13.882 --> 17:15.683
I don't want to do this.

17:22.056 --> 17:23.523
I don't wanna....

17:24.726 --> 17:26.193
- Oh...

17:26.227 --> 17:27.694
Oh, yeah.

17:27.729 --> 17:29.196
No one does it better

17:29.230 --> 17:30.531
than you.

17:35.236 --> 17:36.704
You can cling on to that

17:36.738 --> 17:37.705
anytime you like,

17:37.739 --> 17:38.706
snuggle bear.

17:38.740 --> 17:40.040
- We're through, get out.

17:40.074 --> 17:41.375
- Can I at least

17:41.409 --> 17:42.977
come first?

17:43.011 --> 17:44.478
- Get out!

17:44.513 --> 17:45.646
- Come on.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.647
Are you ready

17:46.681 --> 17:47.982
to say goodbye to this?

17:48.016 --> 17:49.483
- I'll slam the door on it

17:49.518 --> 17:50.985
if you don't get the fuck out.

17:51.019 --> 17:52.486
- Good luck trying to find

17:52.521 --> 17:53.988
someone as hot as me.

17:56.525 --> 17:57.825
I'm gonna come right here

17:57.859 --> 17:59.159
on your front door.

18:01.029 --> 18:02.496
Yeah, you know you wish

18:02.531 --> 18:04.331
you were sucking this.

18:04.365 --> 18:06.000
- What am I doing?

18:06.034 --> 18:09.003
- Oh yeah.

18:09.037 --> 18:11.672
Oh, fuck yeah.

18:19.714 --> 18:20.681
You know what?

18:20.715 --> 18:21.682
Enjoy being alone,

18:21.716 --> 18:22.850
whack job.

18:28.056 --> 18:29.356
- Found him!

18:29.390 --> 18:30.691
- Wow, stalker much?

18:30.725 --> 18:32.026
- What should I say?

18:32.060 --> 18:33.360
- I'm a lonely psychopath

18:33.394 --> 18:34.528
that look you up

18:34.563 --> 18:36.030
within an hour of meeting you.

18:36.064 --> 18:37.364
- Yes, I should wait

18:37.398 --> 18:38.365
until morning.

18:38.399 --> 18:39.533
- Then he'll think

18:39.568 --> 18:40.701
you obsessed about him

18:40.735 --> 18:41.702
all night.

18:41.736 --> 18:42.870
Don't you know anything

18:42.904 --> 18:43.871
about the internet?

18:43.905 --> 18:45.205
You should make a fake profile.

18:45.239 --> 18:46.206
- What?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.374
- Pretend to be

18:47.408 --> 18:48.542
a total random stranger

18:48.577 --> 18:49.877
so you can find out

18:49.911 --> 18:51.045
all his personal details.

18:51.079 --> 18:52.212
People are honest

18:52.246 --> 18:53.213
with strangers.

18:53.247 --> 18:54.381
My fake name

18:54.415 --> 18:55.549
is Tittsy Montgomery.

18:55.584 --> 18:56.884
- I could find out

18:56.918 --> 18:57.885
if he wants

18:57.919 --> 18:58.886
a serious relationship.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.387
- I was thinking more

19:00.421 --> 19:03.057
like cock size but whatever.

19:03.091 --> 19:04.692
You need the perfect

19:04.726 --> 19:07.027
fake picture

19:07.062 --> 19:09.697
and I know the perfect person.

19:11.299 --> 19:12.766
- Holy rim job,

19:12.801 --> 19:14.101
who is that?

19:14.135 --> 19:15.603
- My incredibly hot ex BF,

19:15.637 --> 19:16.604
Ryan.

19:16.638 --> 19:17.605
He's a stripper.

19:17.639 --> 19:18.939
He was supposed to be

19:18.974 --> 19:20.107
my rebound after Troy

19:20.141 --> 19:21.108
broke my heart

19:21.142 --> 19:22.442
but he has a good tongue,

19:22.477 --> 19:23.777
so I let him stay.

19:23.812 --> 19:25.112
- Why did you break up

19:25.146 --> 19:26.446
with that?

19:30.318 --> 19:31.619
- What if your boyfriend

19:31.653 --> 19:32.620
finds out?

19:32.654 --> 19:33.621
- We have

19:33.655 --> 19:34.622
an open relationship.

19:34.656 --> 19:35.956
- Uhh, we do?

19:37.993 --> 19:39.793
- Ryan, this is not

19:39.828 --> 19:41.294
what it looks like.

19:44.332 --> 19:46.466
- Neither is this.

19:48.169 --> 19:49.637
- We had commitment issues.

19:49.671 --> 19:51.138
Anyway, he moved to Tucson

19:51.172 --> 19:52.305
so it's totally safe

19:52.340 --> 19:53.473
to use his pictures.

19:53.508 --> 19:54.975
- Why would I want Zack

19:55.010 --> 19:56.143
to talk to someone

19:56.177 --> 19:57.477
way hotter than I am.

19:57.512 --> 19:58.812
- When's the last time

19:58.847 --> 19:59.813
you opened up

19:59.848 --> 20:00.981
to an ugly stranger?

20:01.016 --> 20:02.149
Besides, you find out

20:02.183 --> 20:03.483
what you need to know,

20:03.518 --> 20:04.652
then Ryan will disappear.

20:04.686 --> 20:05.819
A fake profile

20:05.854 --> 20:07.655
is the perfect wingman.

20:07.689 --> 20:09.489
- Okay.

20:09.524 --> 20:10.991
Okay, let's do this.

20:11.026 --> 20:12.325
What's my name?

20:12.360 --> 20:14.327
- Ryan.

20:14.362 --> 20:16.997
- Ryan.

20:17.032 --> 20:18.498
Do you agree to the following

20:18.533 --> 20:19.667
terms and conditions.

20:19.701 --> 20:20.668
Number one,

20:20.702 --> 20:21.669
GaySpaceBook.com...

20:21.703 --> 20:23.003
- Agree, you nerd!

20:23.038 --> 20:24.171
- You should really

20:24.205 --> 20:25.338
read these things,

20:25.373 --> 20:26.506
you never know.

20:26.541 --> 20:28.008
- What are you, a pilgrim?

20:28.043 --> 20:29.342
I bet you avoid

20:29.377 --> 20:31.645
handicap spaces. And vote.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.380
- Favorite movie?

20:33.414 --> 20:36.050
Roman Holiday, of course.

20:36.084 --> 20:38.719
Straight acting or not?

20:38.753 --> 20:40.220
- Put, "I'm gay,

20:40.254 --> 20:41.722
"why should I act anything

20:41.756 --> 20:43.456
but what I am."

20:43.491 --> 20:44.958
- Oh, you are scary good,

20:44.993 --> 20:46.293
girl.

20:46.995 --> 20:50.297
- Come on, breakup sex.

20:50.331 --> 20:52.299
You are a hottie, let's hope

20:52.333 --> 20:53.967
you're next door

20:54.002 --> 20:55.669
cause I don't feel like driving.

21:04.179 --> 21:10.150
blip-blip-blip-blip

21:10.518 --> 21:11.484
- Looking for?

21:11.519 --> 21:12.820
First I want to develop

21:12.854 --> 21:13.987
something special with you,

21:14.022 --> 21:15.322
then we fuck each other's

21:15.356 --> 21:16.323
brains out.

21:16.357 --> 21:17.324
Perfect combination

21:17.358 --> 21:18.658
of romantic and nasty, right?

21:18.693 --> 21:19.659
- Whatever,

21:19.694 --> 21:20.828
no one reads those,

21:20.862 --> 21:21.995
just write them.

21:22.330 --> 21:26.166
- Oh yeah, oh...

21:35.543 --> 21:38.845
- Yummy.

21:38.879 --> 21:40.347
- Oh, my God, it's him.

21:40.381 --> 21:41.681
What do I do?

21:41.715 --> 21:43.183
What do I write?

21:43.217 --> 21:44.684
- Write what you know.

21:44.718 --> 21:46.653
Well, in your case, don't.

21:46.687 --> 21:48.388
- You're not helping.

21:55.763 --> 21:57.230
- Gotta play it cool.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.733
- Hey.

22:00.768 --> 22:01.901
That's so romantic.

22:06.941 --> 22:08.241
- Kindly help

22:08.276 --> 22:09.576
a broken hearted stranger

22:09.610 --> 22:11.078
with hours of meaningless sex!

22:11.112 --> 22:12.812
- Oh God, yes.

22:22.190 --> 22:24.157
- So, get to know me.

22:24.192 --> 22:25.658
- Oh shit!

22:25.693 --> 22:26.826
Can he see us?

22:26.861 --> 22:27.995
- No.

22:28.029 --> 22:29.729
My camera's not on.

22:31.966 --> 22:33.233
- Oh.

22:39.773 --> 22:41.608
- Likely story.

22:41.642 --> 22:43.343
So, ask away.

22:46.180 --> 22:48.515
Thanks for starting off easy.

22:52.553 --> 22:54.354
I didn't want to put up

22:54.389 --> 22:55.355
with his shit anymore.

22:56.891 --> 22:58.525
You know how you tell yourself

22:58.559 --> 22:59.859
that it's gonna get better?

22:59.894 --> 23:01.028
You know it's not,

23:01.062 --> 23:02.195
but you hang on

23:02.230 --> 23:03.530
to any little good thing

23:03.564 --> 23:04.531
he does

23:04.565 --> 23:05.865
to prove that it might

23:05.900 --> 23:07.034
get better.

23:09.737 --> 23:11.038
Well, I guess

23:11.072 --> 23:12.205
there weren't any.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.540
Then it was just

23:13.574 --> 23:14.874
the really hot sex.

23:19.580 --> 23:21.048
Yeah.

23:25.653 --> 23:26.786
How do you know

23:26.820 --> 23:28.288
what the little good things are?

23:36.164 --> 23:37.864
Okay, try me.

23:39.900 --> 23:42.202
- You're an artist.

23:42.236 --> 23:44.204
I'd take you to a museum.

23:44.238 --> 23:45.705
You look like

23:45.739 --> 23:47.707
a basketball fan.

23:47.741 --> 23:49.709
Lakers tickets.

23:49.743 --> 23:53.713
Massage, good bottle of wine.

23:53.747 --> 23:55.215
And little things

23:55.249 --> 23:57.217
like bringing you

23:57.251 --> 23:58.885
something to drink

23:58.919 --> 24:00.554
without you having to ask.

24:04.925 --> 24:06.393
- Well done, Ms. Cleo.

24:06.427 --> 24:07.727
- What can I do

24:07.761 --> 24:09.463
to get you to come over here

24:09.497 --> 24:10.630
right now.

24:10.664 --> 24:12.132
- Oh, strip.

24:15.002 --> 24:16.136
- Date?

24:16.170 --> 24:17.304
You already know me

24:17.338 --> 24:18.305
inside and out,

24:18.339 --> 24:19.639
I think I'm in love.

24:19.673 --> 24:20.807
Wait, I know.

24:23.844 --> 24:26.146
If you don't come over...

24:26.180 --> 24:28.148
- He is not!

24:28.182 --> 24:29.649
- Here's

24:29.683 --> 24:31.618
what you'll be missing.

24:33.154 --> 24:34.621
- Get out of my way!

24:34.655 --> 24:36.389
Holy clit!

24:36.424 --> 24:38.125
- Oh, my God.

24:38.159 --> 24:39.626
- Oh shit.

24:39.660 --> 24:41.128
- I cannot believe...

24:41.162 --> 24:42.629
- You spilled

24:42.663 --> 24:44.964
your Sunny Delight.

24:44.999 --> 24:46.466
How could you?

24:46.501 --> 24:48.468
- You owe me a computer!

24:48.503 --> 24:50.370
And a boyfriend.

24:52.406 --> 24:53.640
- He's a fake.

24:53.674 --> 24:54.892
No one can be that hot

24:54.926 --> 24:55.893
and that nice,

24:55.927 --> 24:57.060
it's against the nature.

24:57.094 --> 24:58.395
- But he has tons

24:58.429 --> 24:59.396
of profile pictures,

24:59.430 --> 25:00.564
he must be real.

25:00.598 --> 25:01.732
- You still believe

25:01.766 --> 25:02.900
The Hills is real.

25:02.934 --> 25:04.234
- If he was a fake,

25:04.268 --> 25:05.569
he would've watched me jack off.

25:05.603 --> 25:06.904
- I just threw up

25:06.938 --> 25:08.572
a little bit in my pussy.

25:15.279 --> 25:16.580
- Maybe it's not

25:16.614 --> 25:18.916
a good idea for us to hang out?

25:18.950 --> 25:20.250
I don't believe you.

25:20.284 --> 25:21.585
- Zack's single now,

25:21.619 --> 25:22.920
so the reason we invented Ryan

25:22.954 --> 25:23.921
doesn't matter anymore.

25:23.955 --> 25:25.255
I mean, why keep up

25:25.289 --> 25:26.256
the charade?

25:26.290 --> 25:27.758
- Why email him at all?

25:27.792 --> 25:28.759
Just disappear.

25:28.793 --> 25:29.760
You're still

25:29.794 --> 25:30.928
pretending to be Ryan,

25:30.962 --> 25:32.262
even if it is just

25:32.296 --> 25:33.263
to dump him.

25:33.297 --> 25:34.598
- I'm just being polite.

25:34.632 --> 25:35.933
- You're just keeping him

25:35.967 --> 25:37.434
and his pretty dick hanging on,

25:37.468 --> 25:38.769
so you still have access

25:38.803 --> 25:39.937
to him

25:39.971 --> 25:41.271
in case he doesn't go

25:41.305 --> 25:42.439
for exhibit A.

25:42.473 --> 25:43.607
- You're right.

25:43.641 --> 25:45.108
If he normally gets prime rib

25:45.142 --> 25:46.276
like Ryan,

25:46.310 --> 25:47.945
why would he settle for...

25:49.814 --> 25:51.448
- Turkey burger?

25:57.321 --> 25:58.622
- I blew it, Mr. Fake

25:58.656 --> 25:59.790
doesn't wanna meet me.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.124
- Because he's not real.

26:01.158 --> 26:02.459
- I came on too strong.

26:02.493 --> 26:03.794
- Gay men hate guys

26:03.828 --> 26:04.795
who do that.

26:04.829 --> 26:05.963
- He was trying

26:05.997 --> 26:07.297
to get to know me

26:07.331 --> 26:08.632
but I went from zero

26:08.666 --> 26:09.633
to sixty-nine.

26:09.667 --> 26:10.968
- There are millions of men

26:11.002 --> 26:12.135
who can fuck first

26:12.169 --> 26:13.470
and then fall in love.

26:13.504 --> 26:14.972
- But I don't want other men,

26:15.006 --> 26:15.973
I want him.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.307
- My mom warned me

26:17.341 --> 26:19.309
I was turning into a fag hag.

26:19.343 --> 26:20.811
- You're not a fag hag.

26:20.845 --> 26:22.479
- I'm gonna be a fat spinster

26:22.513 --> 26:23.647
whose only sexual outlet

26:23.681 --> 26:24.982
is sucking off drunken homos.

26:25.016 --> 26:26.483
- You'd suck me off

26:26.517 --> 26:28.318
if I were drunk, right?

26:28.352 --> 26:29.987
- My fag hag days

26:30.021 --> 26:31.321
are over.

26:35.693 --> 26:36.660
- Now separate

26:36.694 --> 26:37.661
the finger nails

26:37.695 --> 26:38.829
from the toe nails.

26:38.863 --> 26:39.830
- Ew, what?

26:39.864 --> 26:40.831
- Busy work.

26:40.865 --> 26:41.832
You still have

26:41.866 --> 26:42.833
fifteen minutes left.

26:42.867 --> 26:44.167
- I must get ready

26:44.201 --> 26:45.168
for my date.

26:45.202 --> 26:46.503
- It's not a date,

26:46.537 --> 26:47.504
queef-cake.

26:47.538 --> 26:48.672
- It's a date,

26:48.706 --> 26:50.007
he just doesn't know it yet.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.508
- My, my, look who went

26:51.542 --> 26:52.843
and downloaded some balls.

26:52.877 --> 26:54.177
- He might've seen

26:54.211 --> 26:55.846
Ryan's picture online

26:55.880 --> 26:57.180
last night,

26:57.214 --> 26:58.682
but he was talking to me.

26:58.716 --> 27:00.183
We have a connection.

27:00.217 --> 27:01.685
At least we will

27:01.719 --> 27:03.520
by the end of the night.

27:09.560 --> 27:10.861
- Fuck, I've got

27:10.895 --> 27:12.029
to see this.

27:27.895 --> 27:29.028
- Sorry I'm late.

27:29.063 --> 27:30.196
- Oh, no problem,

27:30.231 --> 27:31.865
I had nothing else to do.

27:31.899 --> 27:33.032
Wait, that sounds bad.

27:33.067 --> 27:34.367
- No it doesn't,

27:34.401 --> 27:35.869
you just moved here.

27:35.903 --> 27:38.872
- I...I drafted up

27:38.906 --> 27:40.373
some ideas

27:40.407 --> 27:42.108
for the male sale flyers.

27:44.145 --> 27:46.112
I Google-imaged you.

27:46.147 --> 27:47.613
- Whoa, these are great.

27:47.648 --> 27:48.782
Thanks for giving me

27:48.816 --> 27:49.783
extra abs.

27:49.817 --> 27:50.950
- Those are yours

27:50.985 --> 27:52.118
and you know it.

27:52.153 --> 27:53.452
- Thanks for the ego boost,

27:53.487 --> 27:54.788
I could really use one

27:54.822 --> 27:55.955
right about now.

27:55.990 --> 27:57.290
- I'm sorry

27:57.324 --> 27:58.624
about your breakup.

27:58.659 --> 27:59.959
- How did you know?

27:59.994 --> 28:01.127
- Oh! I...

28:01.162 --> 28:02.128
- Lionel?

28:02.163 --> 28:03.462
He's a big fucking mouth.

28:03.497 --> 28:04.864
- That's one of the reasons

28:04.899 --> 28:06.365
I don't like the gay community.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.867
- I think the gay community

28:07.902 --> 28:09.035
is more diverse

28:09.069 --> 28:10.369
than you give it credit for.

28:10.404 --> 28:11.704
- Well, I think he's crazy

28:11.738 --> 28:13.039
for breaking up with you.

28:13.073 --> 28:14.540
- I broke up with him.

28:14.574 --> 28:15.708
- Sorry.

28:15.742 --> 28:17.043
- No big deal.

28:17.077 --> 28:18.544
He's not what's bothering me.

28:18.578 --> 28:19.879
I met this guy online

28:19.914 --> 28:21.714
last night, Ryan, oh, my God.

28:21.748 --> 28:23.049
You have never seen

28:23.083 --> 28:24.383
anything like him,

28:24.418 --> 28:26.052
and he was so totally into me

28:26.086 --> 28:27.386
until I blew it.

28:27.421 --> 28:28.888
- You think you blew it?

28:28.923 --> 28:30.223
- Yeah, I got too sexual.

28:30.257 --> 28:31.224
A fatal flaw.

28:31.258 --> 28:32.558
- Well, if he was just

28:32.592 --> 28:33.893
a hot body, those are...

28:33.928 --> 28:35.228
- It was more than that.

28:35.262 --> 28:36.896
This guy connected with me.

28:36.931 --> 28:38.397
He was smart and funny

28:38.432 --> 28:39.899
and he knew me.

28:39.934 --> 28:41.234
- He sounds too good

28:41.268 --> 28:42.568
to be true.

28:42.602 --> 28:43.736
- Yeah, he probably

28:43.770 --> 28:45.071
is fake.

28:45.105 --> 28:46.239
I can't believe

28:46.273 --> 28:47.573
I'm telling you all this.

28:47.607 --> 28:49.075
I normally don't talk to guys

28:49.109 --> 28:50.243
about my social life.

28:50.277 --> 28:51.244
- You seem

28:51.278 --> 28:52.245
pretty comfortable.

28:52.279 --> 28:53.579
- You make me feel

28:53.613 --> 28:55.081
comfortable, Casey.

28:55.115 --> 28:56.582
- Hey, maybe sometime

28:56.616 --> 28:58.084
you and I could...

28:59.119 --> 29:00.753
- Oh my God, that's him.

29:03.790 --> 29:04.924
How do I look?

29:04.959 --> 29:05.925
- Huh?

29:05.960 --> 29:07.093
- How do I look?

29:07.127 --> 29:08.094
- Uh...gorgeous.

29:08.128 --> 29:09.095
Are you sure...

29:09.129 --> 29:10.263
- Wish me luck.

29:12.632 --> 29:14.100
- Good fucking luck.

29:15.702 --> 29:17.670
- Hey, Ryan1989.

29:17.704 --> 29:19.672
- Hey...you.

29:19.706 --> 29:21.174
- I was beginning to think

29:21.208 --> 29:22.342
you were imaginary like

29:22.376 --> 29:24.077
a smurf or something.

29:24.111 --> 29:26.579
- Nope, I'm all real.

29:26.613 --> 29:28.581
- You can say that again.

29:28.615 --> 29:29.749
- Mind if I don't?

29:49.136 --> 29:50.270
- We're both here,

29:50.304 --> 29:51.604
you wanna give this a shot

29:51.638 --> 29:52.939
and go out some night?

29:52.973 --> 29:54.107
- Uuh...

29:55.976 --> 29:58.278
- Ryan, look who's back.

29:58.312 --> 30:00.280
Don't they have stripper poles

30:00.314 --> 30:01.614
in Tucson?

30:01.648 --> 30:03.116
- Tiffany, did you get

30:03.150 --> 30:04.617
a boob job?

30:04.651 --> 30:06.119
- No, I'm still saving up.

30:06.153 --> 30:07.620
- What's going on?

30:07.654 --> 30:09.122
- Casey, this is Ryan

30:09.156 --> 30:10.456
from the Internet.

30:10.490 --> 30:11.791
You look so much better

30:11.825 --> 30:13.526
than your pictures, doesn't he?

30:13.560 --> 30:16.529
- Now, how would Casey

30:16.563 --> 30:18.531
have seen Ryan's cute

30:18.565 --> 30:20.866
little disco boy picture.

30:20.901 --> 30:22.868
- Yeah, you mean

30:22.903 --> 30:24.370
my picture with the headband

30:24.405 --> 30:25.871
and yellow gym shorts.

30:25.906 --> 30:27.373
- Yellow mesh gym shorts.

30:27.408 --> 30:28.707
Rarrr.

30:28.742 --> 30:30.209
And then there's that one

30:30.244 --> 30:31.710
where you're on the beach

30:31.745 --> 30:33.046
with some blond chick

30:33.080 --> 30:34.213
and your bulge.

30:34.248 --> 30:36.882
- Yeah, Ryan loves

30:36.917 --> 30:38.217
nailing blonds.

30:38.252 --> 30:39.718
- Yeah, but I love

30:39.753 --> 30:41.387
nailing brunettes, too.

30:41.422 --> 30:42.721
- Brunette women,

30:42.756 --> 30:43.889
Ryan's straight,

30:43.924 --> 30:45.058
we used to fuck.

30:45.092 --> 30:46.225
I took that picture.

30:46.260 --> 30:47.393
- He wasn't straight

30:47.428 --> 30:48.561
last night.

30:48.595 --> 30:49.728
- Yeah, after

30:49.763 --> 30:50.896
fucking Tiffani

30:50.931 --> 30:52.398
I just gave up on women.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.400
It happens to you a lot, huh?

30:54.435 --> 30:55.734
- Oh, you little cum monkey.

30:55.769 --> 30:57.236
- So, let's give this

30:57.271 --> 30:58.737
a shot.

30:58.772 --> 31:01.074
When do you want to hang out?

31:03.777 --> 31:05.078
- Ugh, this sucks.

31:05.112 --> 31:06.412
I just set up

31:06.447 --> 31:07.746
the hottest couple

31:07.781 --> 31:09.082
in the universe.

31:09.116 --> 31:10.416
When their hot muscled bodies

31:10.451 --> 31:11.584
come together,

31:11.618 --> 31:12.918
they'll probably form

31:12.953 --> 31:14.253
like Voltron or something.

31:14.288 --> 31:15.254
- He's lying.

31:15.289 --> 31:16.255
If Ryan's gay,

31:16.290 --> 31:17.590
I'll eat my own twat.

31:17.624 --> 31:19.092
- What kind of straight guy

31:19.126 --> 31:20.259
goes on a date

31:20.294 --> 31:21.260
with another man?

31:21.295 --> 31:22.595
- He was a stripper

31:22.629 --> 31:23.762
at a gay bar.

31:23.797 --> 31:25.098
He would clean a toilet

31:25.132 --> 31:26.599
with his dick for a dollar.

31:26.633 --> 31:27.600
He's just trying

31:27.634 --> 31:28.934
to get back at me.

31:28.969 --> 31:29.935
- Oh...

31:29.970 --> 31:31.270
Zack wanna talk to me

31:31.305 --> 31:32.605
about what they should do

31:32.639 --> 31:33.939
on their Barbie dream date

31:33.974 --> 31:35.274
because I make him feel

31:35.309 --> 31:36.909
comfortable.

31:36.943 --> 31:38.577
- No smiley.

31:38.612 --> 31:40.079
This is serious.

31:40.114 --> 31:42.081
My God, you're like

31:42.116 --> 31:45.751
his fag hag now.

31:45.785 --> 31:47.953
- I hate my life.

32:04.188 --> 32:05.322
- Casey, great,

32:05.356 --> 32:07.290
you can do my back.

32:07.325 --> 32:09.459
Oh my God, are you ok?

32:09.493 --> 32:11.294
- Yeah, it's just

32:11.329 --> 32:13.296
a little ouchy, that's all.

32:13.331 --> 32:14.631
- Ouchy?

32:14.665 --> 32:16.299
- Never mind, it's fine.

32:16.334 --> 32:18.635
- Good. Squirt me.

32:18.669 --> 32:20.970
- Okay.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.640
- God, I'm as nervous

32:23.674 --> 32:24.641
as Isaiah Washington's

32:24.675 --> 32:25.642
hairdresser.

32:25.676 --> 32:26.810
- About the date?

32:26.844 --> 32:28.144
- Yes, about the date.

32:28.178 --> 32:29.646
He was so hot and cold

32:29.680 --> 32:30.647
at the café.

32:30.681 --> 32:31.815
Isn't he cute?

32:31.849 --> 32:33.149
- I'm not really

32:33.183 --> 32:35.151
into guys that...hot.

32:35.185 --> 32:36.486
- Really?

32:36.520 --> 32:37.821
Okay, your turn.

32:37.855 --> 32:39.155
- Oh, I'm not

32:39.189 --> 32:40.890
a taking off my shirt in public

32:40.924 --> 32:41.891
kind of guy.

32:41.925 --> 32:43.393
- Don't tell me you have

32:43.427 --> 32:44.394
body issues.

32:44.428 --> 32:45.895
Take it off or I will.

32:45.929 --> 32:47.063
- Okay, okay.

32:47.097 --> 32:48.565
You know, when we, mere mortals,

32:48.599 --> 32:49.899
are around gods like you,

32:49.933 --> 32:51.067
how can we not...

32:51.101 --> 32:52.235
- Please, you've got

32:52.269 --> 32:53.403
a great body.

32:53.437 --> 32:54.738
And, besides, some guys

32:54.772 --> 32:56.406
like 'em not all exercised.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.741
Here.

32:57.775 --> 32:59.075
So what should I do

32:59.109 --> 33:00.076
on my date?

33:00.110 --> 33:01.411
- You mean besides sex?

33:01.445 --> 33:03.246
- I don't want it to be

33:03.280 --> 33:04.247
about sex.

33:04.281 --> 33:05.415
When we chatted online

33:05.449 --> 33:06.750
he had all these ideas

33:06.784 --> 33:08.084
for great things to do

33:08.118 --> 33:09.419
and I wanna come up

33:09.453 --> 33:10.754
with some great idea, too.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.255
- Ok, well what's your dream

33:12.289 --> 33:13.256
first date?

33:13.290 --> 33:14.758
- Wow, I guess I never

33:14.792 --> 33:15.925
really thought about it.

33:15.959 --> 33:17.093
- You've never fantasized

33:17.127 --> 33:18.428
about the perfect first date?

33:18.462 --> 33:19.763
- I was too busy

33:19.797 --> 33:20.930
going on real dates.

33:20.964 --> 33:22.098
- Asshole.

33:22.132 --> 33:23.266
- Well, clearly

33:23.300 --> 33:24.768
someone's thought about it.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.102
Tell me yours, Romeo.

33:26.136 --> 33:27.103
- Okay.

33:27.137 --> 33:28.438
We're in Italy, well, Rome.

33:28.472 --> 33:29.606
- Oh, my God,

33:29.640 --> 33:30.607
are you serious?

33:30.641 --> 33:31.775
I'm obsessed with Italy.

33:31.809 --> 33:32.776
- You are?

33:32.810 --> 33:34.110
- Yeah, I've been wanting

33:34.144 --> 33:35.278
to go to Italy

33:35.312 --> 33:36.613
since I was like three.

33:36.647 --> 33:37.781
I'm going after graduation

33:37.815 --> 33:39.282
if I can save enough cash.

33:39.316 --> 33:40.617
I've got like $3,200 saved

33:40.651 --> 33:41.785
so far.

33:41.819 --> 33:43.286
- I can't wait to go.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.287
Someday.

33:44.321 --> 33:45.622
- Well, I can't exactly

33:45.656 --> 33:46.956
take Ryan to Italy tonight.

33:46.990 --> 33:48.625
So, do you got any dream dates

33:48.659 --> 33:49.959
that are a little more

33:49.993 --> 33:51.294
practical?

33:51.328 --> 33:53.296
- Okay, well my dream date,

33:53.330 --> 33:54.964
it's intimate.

33:54.998 --> 33:56.966
Like I make him dinner

33:57.000 --> 33:58.301
so it's personal.

33:58.335 --> 33:59.636
- Yeah, something

33:59.670 --> 34:00.804
at your place,

34:00.838 --> 34:02.138
just the two of you,

34:02.172 --> 34:03.306
no distractions.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.808
- Yeah, and maybe I'd have

34:04.842 --> 34:06.309
a fun theme for the meal.

34:06.343 --> 34:07.477
- Italian.

34:07.511 --> 34:08.645
- Perfetto.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.146
- Pasta, pinot grigio,

34:10.179 --> 34:11.648
some funky Italian music.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.149
- That's all I'd need

34:13.183 --> 34:15.150
because the best first dates

34:15.185 --> 34:16.652
are the ones

34:16.687 --> 34:18.154
where the conversation's

34:18.188 --> 34:19.822
just really easy.

34:19.857 --> 34:21.324
- And it flows cause

34:21.358 --> 34:22.492
you're both listening

34:22.525 --> 34:23.659
to each other

34:23.694 --> 34:24.828
like you're focused.

34:24.862 --> 34:26.161
- And there are

34:26.196 --> 34:27.330
those moments

34:27.364 --> 34:28.665
when you're looking

34:28.699 --> 34:31.000
into each other's eyes,

34:31.034 --> 34:32.835
wondering if maybe he's thinking

34:32.870 --> 34:34.170
the same thing.

34:34.204 --> 34:35.672
- That sometime tonight

34:35.706 --> 34:37.005
we're gonna...

34:37.040 --> 34:38.842
- Kiss.

34:55.225 --> 34:56.525
- Exactly.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.694
Kiss.

34:57.728 --> 34:59.028
Oh my God!

34:59.062 --> 35:00.196
- What?

35:00.230 --> 35:01.531
- You totally inspired me,

35:01.565 --> 35:02.866
I have the perfect date.

35:02.900 --> 35:03.867
Scoot.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.201
He's not gonna know

35:05.235 --> 35:06.369
what hit him.

35:06.403 --> 35:07.704
I can't thank you enough.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.708
- Well, text me

35:11.742 --> 35:13.209
if you need help!

35:13.243 --> 35:14.711
Text me if you need help.

35:34.097 --> 35:35.231
- If you're trying

35:35.265 --> 35:36.733
to stop me, it won't work.

35:36.767 --> 35:37.901
- If you think

35:37.935 --> 35:39.402
going on a fake gay date

35:39.436 --> 35:40.570
will make me jealous,

35:40.604 --> 35:41.571
you're dumber

35:41.605 --> 35:42.906
than a flock of Palins.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.240
- I don't want that,

35:44.274 --> 35:45.742
I just wanna piss you off.

35:45.776 --> 35:46.910
- You cheated too!

35:46.944 --> 35:48.244
- It's not about that,

35:48.278 --> 35:49.579
it's about you putting pubes

35:49.613 --> 35:50.747
in my protein powder

35:50.781 --> 35:51.748
the next day.

35:51.782 --> 35:53.082
- They weren't even mine.

35:53.116 --> 35:54.250
- And poking holes

35:54.284 --> 35:55.418
in my contact lenses,

35:55.452 --> 35:57.420
Putting crabs in my drawer.

35:57.454 --> 35:58.922
And using my toothbrush

35:58.956 --> 36:00.089
to clean the...

36:00.123 --> 36:02.224
- Ok, I'm a jealous woman.

36:02.259 --> 36:04.226
But at least I feel something.

36:04.261 --> 36:06.228
You're an emotionless stripper

36:06.263 --> 36:07.564
who uses his body

36:07.598 --> 36:08.731
as a bargaining chip.

36:08.766 --> 36:09.899
And that's not gonna

36:09.934 --> 36:11.067
get you anything

36:11.101 --> 36:12.334
but a dirty dollar bill

36:12.369 --> 36:13.836
shoved up your ass.

36:13.871 --> 36:15.838
- You're fat.

36:15.873 --> 36:17.173
Have a good night.

36:17.207 --> 36:19.175
I know I will.

36:34.058 --> 36:35.692
- Ryan, right on time.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.526
- Hey, look,

36:37.561 --> 36:38.795
I gotta talk to you

36:38.829 --> 36:39.963
about this Internet thing.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.230
- I know, me too,

36:41.264 --> 36:43.900
come on in.

36:43.934 --> 36:45.167
I saw on your profile

36:45.202 --> 36:46.335
that Roman Holiday

36:46.369 --> 36:47.503
is your favorite movie.

36:47.537 --> 36:48.671
It's also mine.

36:48.706 --> 36:49.839
So I've got

36:49.873 --> 36:51.340
a special little tour for you,

36:51.374 --> 36:52.508
come on.

36:52.542 --> 36:53.676
As you know,

36:53.711 --> 36:54.844
when Audrey Hepburn

36:54.878 --> 36:56.112
sneaks out of the consulate,

36:56.146 --> 36:57.279
Gregory Peck shows her

36:57.314 --> 36:58.447
the sights of Rome.

36:58.482 --> 36:59.616
So here we have

36:59.650 --> 37:00.783
the Sistine Chapel,

37:00.818 --> 37:02.785
painted by Michelangelo.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.622
Italian wine.

37:09.159 --> 37:11.794
Next we have an exact replica

37:11.829 --> 37:14.463
of the Trevi Fountain.

37:18.002 --> 37:20.302
- That's pretty cool.

37:20.337 --> 37:21.804
- And our last stop

37:21.839 --> 37:23.973
is the mouth of truth,

37:24.008 --> 37:25.141
you know,

37:25.175 --> 37:26.308
the most famous scene

37:26.343 --> 37:27.476
in the movie.

37:27.511 --> 37:28.645
- Yeah.

37:28.679 --> 37:29.912
- So put your hand

37:29.947 --> 37:31.080
in its mouth

37:31.115 --> 37:32.581
and if you're lying to me

37:32.616 --> 37:34.316
it'll get bitten off.

37:34.351 --> 37:35.818
And don't tell my landlord

37:35.853 --> 37:38.821
about the hole.

37:42.526 --> 37:43.660
- Rarrr!

37:43.694 --> 37:44.927
- You scared the shit

37:44.962 --> 37:46.095
out of me!

37:46.130 --> 37:47.363
- Your hand's still here.

37:47.397 --> 37:50.700
I knew you wouldn't lie to me.

37:50.734 --> 37:52.535
- You're an amazing guy

37:52.569 --> 37:54.871
and I don't deserve you.

37:54.905 --> 37:56.873
I gotta go.

38:00.577 --> 38:03.212
- Text me, text me,

38:03.246 --> 38:05.048
text me, text me.

38:09.252 --> 38:12.221
I love you, Zack!

38:16.259 --> 38:17.994
- It's nice to have a friend

38:18.028 --> 38:19.162
who will listen

38:19.196 --> 38:20.329
to my romantic problems.

38:20.363 --> 38:22.098
- I told you to text me

38:22.132 --> 38:23.866
if you needed help and you did.

38:23.901 --> 38:25.134
And I'm here to help.

38:25.169 --> 38:26.402
- Can you help me

38:26.436 --> 38:28.404
find a boyfriend?

38:30.273 --> 38:31.407
- Oh my God,

38:31.441 --> 38:34.577
is that the mouth of truth?

38:34.611 --> 38:36.079
- Yeah, his profile said

38:36.113 --> 38:37.246
his favorite movie

38:37.280 --> 38:38.581
was Roman Holiday, so.

38:38.615 --> 38:40.083
- You did that for him?

38:40.117 --> 38:41.584
- It's stupid.

38:41.618 --> 38:42.752
- It's the most

38:42.786 --> 38:44.087
romantic thing

38:44.121 --> 38:48.257
I've ever seen.

38:48.291 --> 38:51.427
See, I'm telling the truth.

38:51.461 --> 38:52.695
- Yeah, I actually had

38:52.730 --> 38:54.697
this whole Roman Holiday tour.

38:54.732 --> 38:56.866
There's the Colossum,

38:56.900 --> 38:59.202
I ate half of it.

38:59.236 --> 39:01.204
- Zack, there's something

39:01.238 --> 39:03.873
I should tell you.

39:03.907 --> 39:05.374
I haven't been honest with you.

39:05.408 --> 39:06.709
I...

39:08.746 --> 39:10.446
- Great, who's that?

39:11.648 --> 39:12.782
Oh my God, Ryan?

39:12.816 --> 39:14.050
- Hey man, there's something

39:14.084 --> 39:16.052
I gotta tell you.

39:16.086 --> 39:18.721
Oh, did you tell him?

39:18.756 --> 39:20.056
- Tell me what?

39:20.090 --> 39:21.557
- I was just about to.

39:21.591 --> 39:22.825
- Of course you were.

39:22.860 --> 39:23.993
That wasn't me

39:24.027 --> 39:25.261
you were talking to online.

39:25.295 --> 39:26.428
Him and Tiffani

39:26.463 --> 39:27.596
made a fake profile

39:27.631 --> 39:28.597
and used my picture.

39:28.632 --> 39:29.766
- What?

39:29.800 --> 39:30.933
- I don't even

39:30.968 --> 39:32.101
have a profile.

39:32.136 --> 39:33.269
I'm not even gay.

39:33.303 --> 39:34.270
- Zack,

39:34.304 --> 39:35.772
it's not what it sounds like.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.539
- Did you pretend to be him?

39:37.574 --> 39:39.041
- Yes, but it was only

39:39.076 --> 39:40.042
because I didn't want

39:40.077 --> 39:41.310
to look like a stalker,

39:41.344 --> 39:43.079
which I know I totally like now.

39:43.113 --> 39:44.080
- My first

39:44.114 --> 39:45.081
genuine conversation in years

39:45.115 --> 39:46.348
was with a total fake.

39:46.383 --> 39:47.349
And why?

39:47.384 --> 39:48.617
So you can fuck me?

39:48.652 --> 39:49.886
- No, I mean yes,

39:49.920 --> 39:51.154
I mean more than that.

39:51.188 --> 39:52.655
The things I said were true.

39:52.689 --> 39:54.157
- Dude, if you liked him,

39:54.191 --> 39:55.658
why didn't you just tell him.

39:55.692 --> 39:57.426
- And you let me take you

39:57.460 --> 39:58.694
on that whole fucking tour

39:58.728 --> 39:59.962
like some kind of idiot.

39:59.997 --> 40:01.130
Get the fuck out!

40:01.165 --> 40:02.298
Both of you.

40:02.332 --> 40:04.033
- Zack, I'm sorry.

40:04.067 --> 40:05.201
Is that...

40:05.235 --> 40:07.369
- Get out!

40:11.742 --> 40:13.208
- I was in the middle

40:13.243 --> 40:14.477
of telling him, you know.

40:14.511 --> 40:15.645
- Sorry man,

40:15.679 --> 40:16.912
it was a crappy thing

40:16.946 --> 40:17.913
you guys did.

40:17.947 --> 40:18.914
- I just wanted

40:18.948 --> 40:19.915
to get his attention.

40:19.949 --> 40:21.183
- You coulda got it

40:21.217 --> 40:22.184
without getting

40:22.218 --> 40:23.185
all stalker-azzi on him.

40:23.219 --> 40:24.453
- With guys like you

40:24.488 --> 40:25.454
walking around?

40:25.489 --> 40:26.955
- Even if I was gay,

40:26.990 --> 40:28.223
it wouldn't have worked out.

40:28.258 --> 40:29.224
He was less

40:29.259 --> 40:30.493
into what I looked like

40:30.527 --> 40:31.994
and more into what you said.

40:32.028 --> 40:32.995
Anyway, sorry.

40:33.029 --> 40:35.331
- No, it's my own damn fault.

40:38.702 --> 40:39.835
- This is Tandy,

40:39.869 --> 40:41.003
impress me.

40:41.037 --> 40:42.171
And if you're

40:42.205 --> 40:43.439
one of my gay friends

40:43.473 --> 40:44.940
and just had a bad date,

40:44.974 --> 40:46.208
I'm not calling you back

40:46.242 --> 40:47.376
for three days.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.945
Because I'm not a fag hag!

40:59.155 --> 41:00.790
- Casey, right?

41:00.824 --> 41:02.124
- Yeah.

41:02.158 --> 41:03.459
- I'm Harry.

41:03.493 --> 41:04.794
That's my name,

41:04.828 --> 41:07.797
not that I am hairy.

41:08.832 --> 41:10.132
Honey, what's wrong?

41:10.166 --> 41:11.300
You look like Liberace

41:11.335 --> 41:13.302
after they put the seat back

41:13.337 --> 41:15.304
on his piano stool.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.473
Wrong generation.

41:17.507 --> 41:19.475
Never mind.

41:19.509 --> 41:20.976
You look like you could use

41:21.010 --> 41:22.144
some company tonight.

41:22.178 --> 41:23.479
- Oh, I'm not interested.

41:23.513 --> 41:26.649
- On, no, darling.

41:26.683 --> 41:27.983
You're adorable

41:28.017 --> 41:29.819
but you're far too young for me.

41:29.853 --> 41:31.086
Us in bed would be

41:31.120 --> 41:32.254
like teaching calculus

41:32.288 --> 41:34.089
to a preschooler.

41:34.123 --> 41:35.090
No.

41:35.124 --> 41:36.258
Sex with men

41:36.292 --> 41:37.426
who have the maturity

41:37.461 --> 41:39.261
of an experienced lover,

41:39.295 --> 41:40.929
there's nothing quite like it.

41:40.964 --> 41:42.097
- T.M.I.

41:42.131 --> 41:43.265
- Pardon?

41:43.299 --> 41:44.433
- Nothing.

41:44.468 --> 41:45.601
- Let me guess.

41:45.635 --> 41:47.102
Some strapping thing

41:47.136 --> 41:48.937
has broken your heart.

41:48.972 --> 41:50.205
- Is it that obvious?

41:50.240 --> 41:51.707
- Either that or Miley Cyrus

41:51.742 --> 41:52.875
died.

41:52.909 --> 41:56.044
See, I'm not that dated.

41:56.079 --> 41:58.714
- Yeah, it's a guy.

41:58.749 --> 42:01.049
No, no, it's me.

42:01.084 --> 42:03.051
I was a complete jerk.

42:03.086 --> 42:04.219
And I knew it

42:04.254 --> 42:05.388
while it was happening

42:05.422 --> 42:06.655
but I did it anyway.

42:06.690 --> 42:07.823
And now I'll never

42:07.858 --> 42:08.991
get to show Zack

42:09.025 --> 42:10.760
what a great boyfriend I can be.

42:10.794 --> 42:12.027
Now I'll never even have

42:12.061 --> 42:13.529
a boyfriend.

42:13.563 --> 42:15.030
And I'll wind up alone

42:15.064 --> 42:18.033
until I'm all old and...

42:18.067 --> 42:19.535
Sorry.

42:19.569 --> 42:21.036
- Oh dear heart,

42:21.070 --> 42:22.371
there's worse things

42:22.406 --> 42:24.507
than not having a boyfriend.

42:24.541 --> 42:26.675
Like trudging bare foot uphill

42:26.710 --> 42:28.176
through five miles of snow

42:28.211 --> 42:29.512
just to find the nearest

42:29.546 --> 42:32.347
homosexual saloon.

42:32.382 --> 42:34.850
It was a joke.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.351
I'm not that old.

42:36.386 --> 42:37.520
- You're not?

42:37.554 --> 42:38.687
- Well now,

42:38.722 --> 42:40.188
that was just not pretty.

42:40.223 --> 42:41.524
All I'm saying is,

42:41.558 --> 42:43.358
as dark as it may seem,

42:43.393 --> 42:44.693
I think your generation

42:44.728 --> 42:45.861
has it pretty easy

42:45.896 --> 42:47.129
when it comes to finding

42:47.163 --> 42:50.966
all the other fish

42:51.000 --> 42:52.968
in the sea.

42:54.170 --> 42:55.471
I bet you're thinking

42:55.505 --> 42:56.639
right now

42:56.673 --> 42:57.807
that the obvious solution

42:57.841 --> 43:00.142
is something that I used to do

43:00.176 --> 43:01.310
when I was trying

43:01.344 --> 43:03.145
to get over someone.

43:03.179 --> 43:04.647
- What's that?

43:04.681 --> 43:06.148
- Well I used to think

43:06.182 --> 43:07.917
that a good roll in the hay

43:07.951 --> 43:09.184
would be all I needed

43:09.218 --> 43:11.353
but I was wrong.

43:11.387 --> 43:13.355
Sleeping with someone

43:13.389 --> 43:15.491
to get over someone else

43:15.525 --> 43:18.160
never works.

43:18.194 --> 43:19.328
- Casey, right?

43:19.362 --> 43:20.496
- Yeah.

43:20.530 --> 43:22.331
- Trust me on this,

43:22.365 --> 43:24.333
it never works.

43:24.367 --> 43:25.835
- You want to go somewhere

43:25.869 --> 43:27.503
and talk?

43:28.538 --> 43:30.840
- Never.

43:30.874 --> 43:33.843
- Sure.

43:37.380 --> 43:40.182
- Never learn.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.521
- That drink was strong,

43:45.555 --> 43:47.523
like drinking blood straight

43:47.557 --> 43:49.024
from Amy Winehouse's wrist.

43:49.058 --> 43:51.026
- God, I'm glad I met you.

43:51.060 --> 43:52.695
Last guy I dated, Zack,

43:52.729 --> 43:54.429
such a fucking loser.

43:54.464 --> 43:56.565
He was a good kisser.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.734
- Kissing's overrated.

43:58.768 --> 44:00.469
How good was he?

44:00.504 --> 44:01.637
- Incredible.

44:01.671 --> 44:04.206
Always started off the same way.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.041
Two pecks.

44:07.911 --> 44:10.546
Then a deeper kiss.

44:12.749 --> 44:13.883
Followed by a bite

44:13.917 --> 44:17.052
to the lower lip.

44:19.422 --> 44:21.390
And repeat.

44:28.097 --> 44:31.066
- Get back in.

44:40.610 --> 44:41.744
We should fuck.

44:41.778 --> 44:42.912
Is that your bed?

44:42.946 --> 44:44.413
- I don't usually do that

44:44.447 --> 44:45.581
on the first...

44:45.615 --> 44:46.849
- Yeah, neither do I.

44:46.883 --> 44:48.851
Right behind you.

46:05.245 --> 46:06.378
- Hi,

46:06.412 --> 46:07.879
how can I hurt you today?

46:07.913 --> 46:09.047
- We gotta talk.

46:09.081 --> 46:10.215
- We have nothing

46:10.250 --> 46:11.383
to talk about.

46:11.417 --> 46:12.551
- Five minutes,

46:12.585 --> 46:14.886
that's all I ask.

46:19.259 --> 46:20.492
- You need to have

46:20.526 --> 46:23.161
an appointment.

46:23.195 --> 46:24.429
- We gotta do something

46:24.464 --> 46:25.764
about Zack and Casey.

46:25.798 --> 46:27.031
- What do you mean,

46:27.066 --> 46:28.800
I thought you were gay for Zack.

46:28.834 --> 46:29.968
- Come on,

46:30.002 --> 46:32.103
you know I'm not gay.

46:34.641 --> 46:36.107
- You know I was just

46:36.142 --> 46:37.376
trying to piss you off.

46:37.410 --> 46:38.644
- Well, it didn't work,

46:38.678 --> 46:40.646
clit monger.

46:43.516 --> 46:45.250
Why would you want to help them.

46:45.285 --> 46:46.518
- They seem like they

46:46.552 --> 46:47.686
actually belong together.

46:47.720 --> 46:49.187
And I messed that up.

46:49.221 --> 46:50.355
- My God,

46:50.390 --> 46:51.523
you have feelings?

46:51.557 --> 46:52.691
I thought your fortes

46:52.725 --> 46:53.858
fortes was cheating

46:53.893 --> 46:55.026
and home wrecking.

46:55.060 --> 46:56.194
- You cheated too.

46:56.228 --> 46:57.696
- He wasn't inside me yet.

46:57.730 --> 46:58.963
- We both fucked up.

46:58.998 --> 47:00.231
But this is our chance

47:00.266 --> 47:02.233
to do something right.

47:04.103 --> 47:06.070
- Aww.

47:06.105 --> 47:08.239
Tyra moment.

47:11.778 --> 47:13.244
How do we get them together?

47:13.279 --> 47:14.513
Zack clearly prefers to be

47:14.547 --> 47:15.681
with gorgeous people

47:15.715 --> 47:16.848
like me and you.

47:16.882 --> 47:18.350
- It takes a lot more

47:18.384 --> 47:19.518
than a gym

47:19.552 --> 47:20.686
and some cucumbers

47:20.720 --> 47:21.853
to make someone gorgeous.

47:21.887 --> 47:23.121
- The point is Casey

47:23.155 --> 47:24.389
isn't even on Zack's menu.

47:24.424 --> 47:25.557
- Exactly!

47:25.591 --> 47:26.725
We're ordering

47:26.759 --> 47:27.892
from the wrong menu.

47:27.927 --> 47:29.060
We gotta go

47:29.094 --> 47:30.228
to another restaurant

47:30.262 --> 47:31.396
where Zack is

47:31.431 --> 47:32.664
and order the hot dog.

47:32.699 --> 47:33.832
Because we really

47:33.866 --> 47:36.335
just want the bun.

47:36.369 --> 47:38.503
- Or we could trick them

47:38.538 --> 47:39.838
into a date.

47:39.872 --> 47:42.407
- That's what I just said.

47:51.617 --> 47:52.917
- Hey there sausage,

47:52.952 --> 47:54.419
why the long dick.

47:54.454 --> 47:57.255
- Oh, it's you.

47:57.289 --> 47:59.591
- Yes, it's me,

47:59.625 --> 48:01.760
the slut with the heart of shit.

48:01.794 --> 48:03.261
- No argument here.

48:03.295 --> 48:04.596
- I know.

48:04.630 --> 48:05.764
I'm sorry,

48:05.798 --> 48:07.899
I owe you a cocktail,

48:07.933 --> 48:09.401
or at least a hand job.

48:09.435 --> 48:10.569
- You've done enough,

48:10.603 --> 48:13.071
really.

48:13.105 --> 48:14.239
Actually,

48:14.273 --> 48:16.408
there is something you can do.

48:16.442 --> 48:17.743
Find me an auctioneer

48:17.777 --> 48:19.911
for the male sale.

48:19.945 --> 48:21.079
- I'll do it.

48:21.113 --> 48:22.581
I used to run the auction

48:22.615 --> 48:23.849
at my stepfather's Jude Ranch.

48:23.883 --> 48:25.016
- Really?

48:25.050 --> 48:26.184
- Yeah.

48:26.218 --> 48:27.352
There's a lot people

48:27.387 --> 48:29.354
don't know about me.

48:31.391 --> 48:33.024
Listen.

48:33.058 --> 48:34.526
You need to know the truth

48:34.560 --> 48:36.027
about what went down with Casey.

48:36.061 --> 48:37.529
- Casey can suck my balls.

48:37.563 --> 48:39.030
- Well, that's what he's been

48:39.064 --> 48:40.298
trying to say all along.

48:40.332 --> 48:41.800
- You know what I mean.

48:41.834 --> 48:43.301
- I know.

48:43.335 --> 48:44.803
Come on, let me buy you

48:44.837 --> 48:46.137
a drink later.

48:46.171 --> 48:47.472
You shouldn't be alone

48:47.507 --> 48:48.973
during this delicate juncture.

48:49.008 --> 48:51.810
Trust me, I've been there.

48:53.178 --> 48:57.649
Where is your fag hag anyway?

48:57.683 --> 48:58.817
Oh, come on,

48:58.851 --> 49:00.819
I'll sub for her.

49:00.853 --> 49:01.986
- You can't sub

49:02.021 --> 49:03.154
for a best friend.

49:03.188 --> 49:04.322
- You're gay

49:04.356 --> 49:05.590
and I'm a straight girl

49:05.625 --> 49:06.758
of big tits.

49:06.793 --> 49:07.926
Evolution has

49:07.960 --> 49:09.093
genetically programmed us

49:09.128 --> 49:10.595
to be there for each other.

49:10.630 --> 49:11.763
Like the clown fish

49:11.798 --> 49:12.931
and the sea anemone.

49:12.965 --> 49:14.933
Now, what'd you say?

49:21.307 --> 49:22.441
- Casey!

49:22.475 --> 49:23.775
- Oh, hey.

49:23.810 --> 49:24.943
- You, me, drinks.

49:24.977 --> 49:26.110
Tonight.

49:26.145 --> 49:27.278
- No.

49:27.313 --> 49:28.447
What's up with you

49:28.481 --> 49:29.714
going out with gay guys.

49:29.749 --> 49:31.215
- I want to make up

49:31.250 --> 49:32.484
for screwing up your game.

49:32.518 --> 49:33.752
- Yeah, I don't think

49:33.786 --> 49:35.520
a Blue Ribbon or whatever it is

49:35.555 --> 49:36.688
straight guys drink

49:36.722 --> 49:37.689
is gonna help.

49:37.723 --> 49:39.458
- I'll put an umbrella in it.

49:39.492 --> 49:40.459
Awesome.

49:40.493 --> 49:43.795
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

49:43.830 --> 49:46.130
- Awesome.

49:56.192 --> 49:57.492
- It's me.

49:57.526 --> 49:58.827
- We're set.

49:58.861 --> 49:59.995
- Great!

50:00.029 --> 50:01.496
Now be a good little stripper

50:01.530 --> 50:02.764
and do whatever it takes

50:02.799 --> 50:04.032
to get those boys all

50:04.067 --> 50:05.533
horned up and ready to blow.

50:05.568 --> 50:06.802
- I think they care

50:06.836 --> 50:07.969
about more than sex.

50:08.004 --> 50:09.137
- Jesus, you sound

50:09.172 --> 50:10.638
like a woman that isn't me.

50:10.673 --> 50:12.974
Of course they care about sex.

50:13.009 --> 50:14.142
If they don't,

50:14.177 --> 50:15.410
that's what the alcohol's for.

50:15.444 --> 50:16.912
- Well, you just show up

50:16.946 --> 50:18.246
when you're supposed to.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.915
- Honey, I'm a as reliable

50:19.949 --> 50:21.416
as birth control.

50:21.450 --> 50:22.684
- That's not a 100%.

50:22.719 --> 50:25.253
- Take it or leave it.

50:29.959 --> 50:31.259
- Tandy,

50:31.293 --> 50:32.427
what's up dragon lady?

50:32.461 --> 50:33.695
- I got your non-call,

50:33.730 --> 50:35.197
leave a fucking V.M. next time.

50:35.231 --> 50:36.198
- You said

50:36.232 --> 50:37.465
you didn't want to hear

50:37.499 --> 50:38.466
about gay problems.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.467
- Good point,

50:39.501 --> 50:40.635
thanks for sparing me

50:40.669 --> 50:41.903
the Queer as Folk rerun.

50:41.938 --> 50:42.904
Where are we going?

50:42.939 --> 50:43.905
- To hang out

50:43.940 --> 50:44.906
with my new friend,

50:44.941 --> 50:45.907
remember that girl, Tiffani.

50:45.942 --> 50:46.908
- The sluttier version

50:46.943 --> 50:47.909
of Tara Reid?

50:47.944 --> 50:49.177
You're hanging out with her?

50:49.212 --> 50:50.445
- She wanted to hear

50:50.479 --> 50:51.613
about my problems.

50:51.647 --> 50:53.448
- I smell a rat

50:53.482 --> 50:57.285
with fake tits.

50:57.319 --> 50:59.054
- To all the boys I fucked

50:59.088 --> 51:00.789
and never called back.

51:00.823 --> 51:01.957
- That must be

51:01.991 --> 51:03.125
like a hundred.

51:03.159 --> 51:04.626
- Like ten years ago maybe.

51:04.660 --> 51:07.963
- Z Here's to me catching up.

51:12.334 --> 51:14.970
- So, this whole Internet...

51:15.004 --> 51:16.304
- Lie.

51:16.338 --> 51:17.639
- Performance

51:17.673 --> 51:19.975
was totally 100% my idea.

51:20.009 --> 51:21.810
Casey had nothing to do

51:21.844 --> 51:23.145
with it.

51:23.179 --> 51:24.412
- But he's the one

51:24.446 --> 51:27.082
who chatted with me, right?

51:27.116 --> 51:28.750
- Yes.

51:28.785 --> 51:31.086
But I practically raped him

51:31.120 --> 51:33.088
into it.

51:33.122 --> 51:34.589
- So what he said,

51:34.623 --> 51:37.159
how much of that was him?

51:38.527 --> 51:41.663
- Just the good stuff.

51:41.697 --> 51:43.665
- He's lucky to have you,

51:43.699 --> 51:46.168
except for the raping part.

51:46.202 --> 51:48.303
- To the raping part.

51:48.337 --> 51:50.972
- To the raping part.

52:10.026 --> 52:11.159
- Trust me,

52:11.194 --> 52:12.427
this is so much better

52:12.461 --> 52:13.594
than shaving.

52:13.629 --> 52:17.432
- That feels really weird.

52:17.466 --> 52:18.599
- Assholes

52:18.634 --> 52:21.102
are like snowflakes.

52:21.137 --> 52:23.104
Speaking of pretty assholes,

52:23.139 --> 52:24.272
why were you dating

52:24.307 --> 52:26.274
that Lionel guy?

52:26.309 --> 52:27.442
- What?

52:27.476 --> 52:28.776
You've never dated

52:28.811 --> 52:30.445
an asshole before?

52:30.479 --> 52:32.613
- Honey,

52:32.648 --> 52:35.450
assholes are attracted to me

52:35.484 --> 52:38.954
like shit to assholes.

52:38.988 --> 52:40.455
- And why did you stay

52:40.489 --> 52:41.622
with them?

52:41.657 --> 52:42.790
- Sex.

52:42.825 --> 52:43.959
- Exactly!

52:43.993 --> 52:45.227
I have the same problem,

52:45.261 --> 52:46.728
I can't say no to cock.

52:46.762 --> 52:47.896
- Oh, you're fucking

52:47.930 --> 52:49.064
to the choir.

52:49.098 --> 52:52.400
Dick, it just like blinds me,

52:52.434 --> 52:54.736
you know.

52:54.770 --> 52:55.904
- You ripped out

52:55.938 --> 52:57.906
my sphincter!

52:59.275 --> 53:01.392
- My turn.

53:01.427 --> 53:02.560
- You know,

53:02.594 --> 53:05.230
Zack is totally into you.

53:05.264 --> 53:06.965
- No he's not.

53:06.999 --> 53:08.233
I need to give up

53:08.267 --> 53:10.068
and go for someone uglier.

53:10.102 --> 53:12.904
Not like Michael Stipe ugly,

53:12.939 --> 53:14.405
but at least

53:14.440 --> 53:16.908
Rufus Wainwright ugly.

53:16.943 --> 53:19.477
- I don't watch that show.

53:19.511 --> 53:20.812
But I've been watching

53:20.847 --> 53:22.547
gay guys for years.

53:22.581 --> 53:23.715
See, they don't think

53:23.749 --> 53:25.050
the strippers can see back,

53:25.084 --> 53:27.219
but we totally can.

53:27.253 --> 53:28.720
You guys' problem is

53:28.754 --> 53:29.888
you don't even talk

53:29.922 --> 53:31.056
to each other,

53:31.090 --> 53:32.224
you're always waiting

53:32.258 --> 53:33.391
for someone else

53:33.425 --> 53:35.060
to make the first move.

53:35.094 --> 53:36.561
- I gave him my number,

53:36.595 --> 53:38.563
I volunteered for the male sale,

53:38.597 --> 53:40.398
I took off my shirt for him.

53:40.432 --> 53:42.734
I stalked him on the Internet.

53:42.768 --> 53:44.903
I made all the moves.

53:44.937 --> 53:46.404
- But when'd you tell him

53:46.438 --> 53:49.407
you liked him.

53:49.441 --> 53:50.575
- You know,

53:50.609 --> 53:54.079
you could cheat on me,

53:54.113 --> 53:55.413
steal all my money

53:55.447 --> 53:57.148
and kill my mother

53:57.183 --> 53:59.150
but if you're hot,

53:59.185 --> 54:00.818
I'll make excuses for you

54:00.853 --> 54:03.821
until the day you leave me.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.327
Or turn gay.

54:09.362 --> 54:11.496
Or both.

54:12.865 --> 54:15.166
Oh, damn,

54:15.201 --> 54:16.667
all out of liquor.

54:16.702 --> 54:18.169
Let's get out of here.

54:18.204 --> 54:19.504
You can have that one,

54:19.538 --> 54:21.839
I got plenty at home.

54:28.547 --> 54:29.680
- That pizza

54:29.715 --> 54:31.182
ought to be here any minute.

54:31.217 --> 54:33.851
- Yum, pizza.

54:33.886 --> 54:35.020
- What if

54:35.054 --> 54:36.187
your boyfriend Zack

54:36.222 --> 54:37.688
was the delivery boy?

54:37.723 --> 54:40.025
- You are such a stripper.

54:40.059 --> 54:43.194
And he's not my boyfriend.

54:43.229 --> 54:44.695
- I gotta hit the head,

54:44.730 --> 54:46.531
get the door if the pizza comes.

54:46.565 --> 54:48.866
- Ok.

55:35.781 --> 55:37.415
- You've been

55:37.450 --> 55:40.085
a very bad boy.

55:40.119 --> 55:41.419
You have the right

55:41.454 --> 55:43.921
to remain sexy.

55:43.956 --> 55:45.223
Anything you touch

55:45.257 --> 55:46.724
will be held against you

55:46.758 --> 55:48.726
in the court of my...

55:53.599 --> 55:55.400
Hit me with that pepperoni!

55:55.434 --> 55:59.404
- Casey?

55:59.438 --> 56:00.571
- Gotta go,

56:00.606 --> 56:03.908
you two work it out, bye.

56:03.942 --> 56:05.076
- Damn it!

56:05.111 --> 56:06.244
- Hey Zack.

56:06.278 --> 56:08.246
- Nice hat.

56:12.618 --> 56:13.918
- Are they fucking yet?

56:13.952 --> 56:15.653
- Not even close.

56:15.687 --> 56:17.155
Is this gonna work?

56:17.189 --> 56:18.490
- Trust me, it's science.

56:18.524 --> 56:19.657
If you leave

56:19.691 --> 56:20.825
two dicks together,

56:20.859 --> 56:21.993
eventually one of them's

56:22.028 --> 56:23.161
going to need sucking.

56:23.195 --> 56:24.329
Like prison.

56:24.363 --> 56:27.165
- I'm really sorry

56:27.199 --> 56:29.501
about what I did.

56:29.535 --> 56:31.836
- Who does stuff like that?

56:31.870 --> 56:34.172
- People with no self-esteem?

56:34.206 --> 56:35.507
- It's kinda mean.

56:35.541 --> 56:36.674
- I'm sorry,

56:36.708 --> 56:37.942
it got out of hand.

56:37.976 --> 56:40.278
I just...I wanted to...

56:40.312 --> 56:41.446
I don't know.

56:41.480 --> 56:42.947
I wanted to meet you.

56:42.981 --> 56:44.215
- You did meet me.

56:44.250 --> 56:45.716
- I know,

56:45.751 --> 56:49.887
I'm just an idiot.

56:49.922 --> 56:51.389
- It's not a big deal,

56:51.424 --> 56:53.391
it's over.

56:55.594 --> 56:56.727
- Come on,

56:56.762 --> 56:57.895
this is the part

56:57.930 --> 56:59.064
where you fuck him.

56:59.098 --> 57:00.231
- Man,

57:00.266 --> 57:01.499
he just looked at you.

57:01.534 --> 57:03.000
Look back.

57:03.035 --> 57:04.001
- The dick sucking

57:04.036 --> 57:05.002
principle should take effect

57:05.037 --> 57:06.003
any second.

57:06.038 --> 57:07.272
- Nah, I've seen guys

57:07.306 --> 57:08.540
do this at the club.

57:08.574 --> 57:09.807
They'll sit there for hours

57:09.841 --> 57:11.076
and never say a word,

57:11.110 --> 57:12.077
no matter how much

57:12.111 --> 57:13.078
they like each other.

57:13.112 --> 57:14.079
- Go do something.

57:14.113 --> 57:15.913
- There's nothing I can do.

57:15.948 --> 57:17.915
Except...

57:17.950 --> 57:19.084
- What?

57:19.118 --> 57:20.351
- Work my stripper magic.

57:20.386 --> 57:21.519
- Stripper magic?

57:21.554 --> 57:23.020
- When I see two guys

57:23.055 --> 57:24.289
doing this at the club,

57:24.323 --> 57:25.457
I'll get between them

57:25.491 --> 57:26.958
and make them put their hands

57:26.992 --> 57:28.126
all over me.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.894
Then, I'll get out of the way

57:29.928 --> 57:31.162
and they're so worked up

57:31.197 --> 57:32.163
that they're

57:32.198 --> 57:33.164
all over each other.

57:33.199 --> 57:34.432
- You're like a stripper

57:34.467 --> 57:35.433
Harriett Tubman.

57:35.468 --> 57:36.434
- Exactly!

57:36.469 --> 57:37.702
- Get to it Harriett,

57:37.736 --> 57:39.721
the dogs are coming.

57:48.096 --> 57:49.230
- Thank God,

57:49.264 --> 57:50.398
can we leave now?

57:50.432 --> 57:51.900
- You boys sit right there,

57:51.934 --> 57:53.067
this party's

57:53.101 --> 57:55.069
just getting started.

57:57.940 --> 57:59.073
Let me show you

57:59.107 --> 58:01.409
some classic stripper moves.

58:01.443 --> 58:02.577
- What the fuck

58:02.611 --> 58:03.745
are you doing?

58:03.779 --> 58:04.913
- You guys

58:04.947 --> 58:06.080
are at full attention,

58:06.114 --> 58:07.248
and Sergeant Ryan's here

58:07.282 --> 58:09.250
to release it.

58:12.287 --> 58:15.256
Now, both of you

58:15.290 --> 58:18.259
make a wish and pull.

58:18.293 --> 58:19.427
- You've got

58:19.461 --> 58:20.595
to be kidding me.

58:20.629 --> 58:21.763
- Well it is

58:21.797 --> 58:23.031
kind of an ugly shirt.

58:23.065 --> 58:25.033
- Totally generic.

58:26.569 --> 58:29.370
- That's more like it.

58:30.405 --> 58:31.706
Free.

58:31.740 --> 58:33.374
Now, rip open

58:33.408 --> 58:35.376
rigid Ryan's jeans.

58:35.410 --> 58:36.711
- You're straight?

58:36.745 --> 58:38.212
- We're just three dudes

58:38.246 --> 58:39.881
having some fun.

58:39.915 --> 58:42.216
Now pull.

58:44.753 --> 58:46.220
- Are you hard?

58:46.254 --> 58:47.555
- Maybe.

58:47.590 --> 58:50.725
Are you?

58:50.759 --> 58:53.728
Gotta get out of these pants.

58:59.602 --> 59:00.902
There's never a sexy way

59:00.936 --> 59:02.169
to get the jeans off.

59:02.204 --> 59:03.337
- I don't know,

59:03.371 --> 59:04.505
that's pretty...

59:04.539 --> 59:05.506
- Sexy.

59:05.540 --> 59:06.507
- Your turn.

59:06.541 --> 59:07.508
- For what?

59:07.542 --> 59:08.776
- For your free lesson

59:08.811 --> 59:09.944
in exotic dancing,

59:09.979 --> 59:11.445
it's an actual skill you know.

59:11.480 --> 59:12.614
- I'm in.

59:12.648 --> 59:13.781
- I'll watch.

59:13.816 --> 59:15.049
- No looky-loos, come on.

59:15.084 --> 59:16.217
Undo your shirts.

59:16.251 --> 59:17.551
With more confidence.

59:17.586 --> 59:20.554
A slow reveal.

59:22.925 --> 59:24.225
Good.

59:24.259 --> 59:25.392
Now, when you get

59:25.427 --> 59:26.560
to the last button,

59:26.595 --> 59:28.062
take your shirt at the collar

59:28.097 --> 59:30.397
and slowly peel it off.

59:31.433 --> 59:32.566
Good, that's hot.

59:32.601 --> 59:33.901
- Yeah.

59:33.936 --> 59:35.569
- Now, pull your pants off

59:35.604 --> 59:36.738
like I did,

59:36.772 --> 59:37.905
and lead forward,

59:37.940 --> 59:39.907
like this.

59:43.612 --> 59:45.079
Come on, we're in underwear.

59:45.114 --> 59:48.082
Zack, come here, take a side.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.419
- Well,

59:52.454 --> 59:55.256
that was certainly fun.

59:55.290 --> 59:58.259
- Now give me a lap dance.

01:00:00.295 --> 01:00:01.763
- How's this?

01:00:01.797 --> 01:00:02.930
- You dance

01:00:02.965 --> 01:00:04.098
like a straight boy.

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:05.366
You need to move them

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.534
like this.

01:00:06.568 --> 01:00:08.036
You're all thrust and no grind.

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:09.704
Casey, come here.

01:00:09.738 --> 01:00:12.540
Put your hands here.

01:00:12.574 --> 01:00:14.709
Feel this.

01:00:14.743 --> 01:00:17.045
That's hot.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.220
You know,

01:00:26.254 --> 01:00:28.890
you guys make a hot couple.

01:00:30.592 --> 01:00:32.226
Guys, I think I'm gonna...

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.394
- You're not

01:00:33.428 --> 01:00:34.562
gonna go anywhere

01:00:34.596 --> 01:00:36.564
when you're that hard.

01:00:56.451 --> 01:00:58.252
- Oh yeah.

01:00:58.286 --> 01:00:59.921
That's so hot.

01:00:59.955 --> 01:01:01.089
- Oh my God,

01:01:01.123 --> 01:01:03.424
that is so fucking hot!

01:01:26.982 --> 01:01:28.249
- Fuck yeah,

01:01:28.283 --> 01:01:31.252
work that pussy.

01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:42.429
- And what do we have here?

01:01:42.464 --> 01:01:44.098
Shew, get away.

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:45.266
- I don't do

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.433
the lesbian thing anymore.

01:01:46.468 --> 01:01:47.601
- I knew

01:01:47.636 --> 01:01:48.770
this was gonna happen.

01:01:48.804 --> 01:01:50.938
- You did?

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:52.940
Get over here.

01:01:54.476 --> 01:01:55.777
- What the...

01:01:55.811 --> 01:01:57.945
- Ready for the Zack special?

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.951
Help me.

01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:08.122
- Holy crap.

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.456
Oh yeah, I've never had

01:02:09.491 --> 01:02:11.959
two months before, yeah,

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.328
one of you do the balls.

01:02:14.362 --> 01:02:17.665
Oh my God!

01:02:19.367 --> 01:02:20.601
- Why are you fucking

01:02:20.635 --> 01:02:21.769
with Zack?

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:22.937
- Technically

01:02:22.971 --> 01:02:24.105
I'm watching them

01:02:24.139 --> 01:02:25.273
fuck with Zack.

01:02:25.307 --> 01:02:26.440
- I'm breaking up

01:02:26.474 --> 01:02:27.708
that blow fest right now.

01:02:27.742 --> 01:02:29.210
- Over my hot dead body.

01:02:29.244 --> 01:02:30.377
- That's what

01:02:30.412 --> 01:02:32.379
I was planning.

01:02:39.754 --> 01:02:42.890
Oh!

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:45.059
Is that pussy juice?

01:02:45.093 --> 01:02:48.395
- A thousand dollars worth.

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:52.233
Oh!

01:02:52.267 --> 01:02:54.401
- Guys, I'm gonna...

01:02:54.436 --> 01:02:55.569
I'm gonna...

01:02:55.603 --> 01:02:56.737
I'm gonna...

01:02:56.771 --> 01:03:00.407
Jesus Mary Jenna Jameson!

01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:01.675
- I've never heard that

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:02.844
without anything

01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:04.846
in my pussy before.

01:03:27.569 --> 01:03:29.370
- Wow.

01:03:29.404 --> 01:03:32.039
- Wow.

01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:34.541
- Wow!

01:03:34.576 --> 01:03:36.277
- You fucking bitch.

01:03:36.311 --> 01:03:37.444
- Let me kick

01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:38.946
that pussy again.

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.114
- Tandy?

01:03:40.148 --> 01:03:41.282
- Tiffani?

01:03:41.316 --> 01:03:42.616
- Sorry I'm late.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.952
Woman things.

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:50.958
God, I miss that cock.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.126
- Are you ok?

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.861
- Kill the bitch.

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.363
- What the hell happened?

01:03:55.397 --> 01:03:56.530
- I was trying

01:03:56.564 --> 01:03:57.698
to protect you.

01:03:57.732 --> 01:03:58.866
- I appreciate it

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.368
but it turns out

01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:02.370
that everything's just fine.

01:04:02.404 --> 01:04:03.537
Better than fine.

01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:04.705
- What?

01:04:04.739 --> 01:04:06.207
Are you life partners now?

01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:08.542
- I think we're...

01:04:08.576 --> 01:04:12.046
- Thanks to me and Ryan,

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.715
and Ryan's friend.

01:04:14.749 --> 01:04:15.883
- Zack, I have

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.385
the perfect first date for us.

01:04:17.419 --> 01:04:18.652
- Like your first date

01:04:18.686 --> 01:04:20.988
with him?

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.126
You're just like everyone else.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.129
Fuck you!

01:04:32.167 --> 01:04:35.303
- You're all assholes.

01:04:37.005 --> 01:04:38.806
- I miss how we fuck.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.475
- Rigid Ryan misses you too.

01:04:41.509 --> 01:04:43.210
- Oh come on,

01:04:43.245 --> 01:04:44.478
let's go suck the gay

01:04:44.512 --> 01:04:46.814
out of your cock.

01:04:57.509 --> 01:04:58.742
- I hate the Internet.

01:04:58.776 --> 01:05:00.011
- You can use it

01:05:00.045 --> 01:05:01.278
for things other than sex.

01:05:01.313 --> 01:05:02.613
- Like what?

01:05:02.647 --> 01:05:03.780
- Well,

01:05:03.815 --> 01:05:04.948
maybe gay people can't.

01:05:04.983 --> 01:05:06.117
- Speaking

01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:07.284
of trolling for sex,

01:05:07.319 --> 01:05:08.285
I can't believe

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.286
Casey just slept

01:05:09.321 --> 01:05:10.287
with the first thing

01:05:10.322 --> 01:05:11.288
that looked at him.

01:05:11.323 --> 01:05:12.556
- Ugh, I hate him.

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:13.557
But in his defense,

01:05:13.591 --> 01:05:15.059
you did sort of reject him.

01:05:15.093 --> 01:05:16.060
- So?

01:05:16.094 --> 01:05:17.328
- What did you do

01:05:17.362 --> 01:05:18.329
when Lionel rejected you?

01:05:18.363 --> 01:05:19.330
You trolled...

01:05:19.364 --> 01:05:21.165
- Online for sex.

01:05:21.199 --> 01:05:22.333
- I hate

01:05:22.367 --> 01:05:24.502
that you're always right.

01:05:24.536 --> 01:05:26.504
It's like Jesus is my fag hag.

01:05:26.538 --> 01:05:27.505
Wait, sorry,

01:05:27.539 --> 01:05:28.772
I know you don't like

01:05:28.806 --> 01:05:29.773
being called...

01:05:29.807 --> 01:05:31.042
- I'm dealing with it.

01:05:31.076 --> 01:05:32.209
I'm your fag hag.

01:05:32.244 --> 01:05:34.045
Not a fag hag.

01:05:34.079 --> 01:05:36.213
Your fag hag.

01:05:36.248 --> 01:05:38.715
- Thank you sweetie.

01:05:40.085 --> 01:05:41.818
- But if I'm your fag hag,

01:05:41.853 --> 01:05:43.954
then you're my gay bitch.

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:47.291
- Gay bitch

01:05:47.325 --> 01:05:49.126
loves his fag hag.

01:05:49.161 --> 01:05:50.461
- You better bitch,

01:05:50.495 --> 01:05:52.463
I got a black eye for you.

01:06:03.175 --> 01:06:04.808
- Casey? Honey?

01:06:04.842 --> 01:06:06.310
- I'm moving back home.

01:06:06.344 --> 01:06:07.578
Can you drop me off

01:06:07.612 --> 01:06:08.745
at the bus station

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.913
when I'm done packing?

01:06:09.948 --> 01:06:11.182
- I thought you were

01:06:11.216 --> 01:06:12.349
making new friends?

01:06:12.384 --> 01:06:13.617
Don't you like it here?

01:06:13.651 --> 01:06:14.785
The cheap rent,

01:06:14.819 --> 01:06:15.953
the beautiful weather,

01:06:15.987 --> 01:06:18.289
the abundance of gay ass.

01:06:18.323 --> 01:06:19.623
- I turned everything

01:06:19.657 --> 01:06:21.292
into a big wet mess.

01:06:21.326 --> 01:06:22.460
- Oh honey,

01:06:22.494 --> 01:06:23.727
it can't be that bad.

01:06:23.761 --> 01:06:24.895
- It's horrible!

01:06:24.929 --> 01:06:26.730
It's like 9/11 but with sex.

01:06:26.764 --> 01:06:28.732
- Like a 69/11.

01:06:28.766 --> 01:06:30.067
- You're horrible.

01:06:30.102 --> 01:06:31.735
- Oh honey, come on.

01:06:31.769 --> 01:06:33.003
I don't know what kind

01:06:33.037 --> 01:06:34.338
of orgie-astic corfafel

01:06:34.372 --> 01:06:35.506
you've gotten yourself

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.673
wrapped up in.

01:06:36.708 --> 01:06:37.841
But I do know

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:39.009
that when you run

01:06:39.043 --> 01:06:40.177
from your problems,

01:06:40.212 --> 01:06:41.345
the location might change

01:06:41.379 --> 01:06:42.513
but your problems

01:06:42.547 --> 01:06:43.680
will be right there

01:06:43.715 --> 01:06:44.848
waiting for you.

01:06:44.882 --> 01:06:46.016
Only there

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:47.284
you won't have cheap rent

01:06:47.319 --> 01:06:48.452
and this beautiful weather.

01:06:48.487 --> 01:06:49.620
- What about

01:06:49.654 --> 01:06:50.887
the abundance of gay ass?

01:06:50.922 --> 01:06:51.888
- Honey,

01:06:51.923 --> 01:06:53.157
you can find that anywhere.

01:06:53.191 --> 01:06:54.158
Now come on,

01:06:54.192 --> 01:06:55.326
tell your auntie Helen

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.494
all about your problem.

01:06:56.528 --> 01:06:58.829
I promise you won't shock me.

01:06:58.863 --> 01:06:59.997
- Ok, I pretended

01:07:00.031 --> 01:07:01.499
to be Ryan to Zack online

01:07:01.533 --> 01:07:02.766
but then Ryan showed up

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.034
and went out with Zack

01:07:04.068 --> 01:07:05.302
to get back at Tiffani.

01:07:05.337 --> 01:07:06.303
Anyway,

01:07:06.338 --> 01:07:07.471
I think Zack realized

01:07:07.506 --> 01:07:09.240
he liked me for who I am

01:07:09.274 --> 01:07:10.741
and not the way Ryan looked

01:07:10.775 --> 01:07:12.009
but he never told me.

01:07:12.043 --> 01:07:13.010
So I fucked Lionel

01:07:13.044 --> 01:07:14.011
who was probably just

01:07:14.045 --> 01:07:15.513
trying to get back at Zack,

01:07:15.547 --> 01:07:17.281
and then Ryan got Zack and me

01:07:17.315 --> 01:07:18.549
to give him a blowjob

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:20.050
in order to get us together.

01:07:20.084 --> 01:07:21.051
And it actually worked.

01:07:21.085 --> 01:07:22.319
Until Zack got a videoclip

01:07:22.354 --> 01:07:24.321
of me and Lionel doing it.

01:07:24.356 --> 01:07:26.657
- So, Zack never told you

01:07:26.691 --> 01:07:27.991
how he felt.

01:07:28.026 --> 01:07:29.326
- Yeah.

01:07:29.361 --> 01:07:30.494
- And you're just

01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:31.662
gonna leave town

01:07:31.696 --> 01:07:33.164
without giving him a chance to.

01:07:33.198 --> 01:07:34.431
- You're not leaving town

01:07:34.466 --> 01:07:35.599
you fuck tard.

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:36.767
We have a date

01:07:36.801 --> 01:07:37.934
and I'm not running

01:07:37.969 --> 01:07:39.102
that auction alone.

01:07:39.137 --> 01:07:40.271
- The slut's right.

01:07:40.305 --> 01:07:41.438
Don't pussy out

01:07:41.473 --> 01:07:42.606
on the youth center

01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:43.774
just because someone hurt

01:07:43.808 --> 01:07:44.941
your dick's feelings.

01:07:44.976 --> 01:07:46.109
- Love her.

01:07:46.144 --> 01:07:47.278
Besides, when you run

01:07:47.312 --> 01:07:48.445
from your problems,

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.613
the location may change...

01:07:49.648 --> 01:07:51.114
- I already got that speech.

01:07:51.149 --> 01:07:52.115
- Than what are

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.116
we waiting for,

01:07:53.151 --> 01:07:54.117
cum boy,

01:07:54.152 --> 01:07:55.286
we're gonna be late.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.839
- Bah-bye.

01:08:03.344 --> 01:08:04.812
- I smell an open bar.

01:08:04.846 --> 01:08:05.980
- Get me anything

01:08:06.014 --> 01:08:07.148
with a whiskey

01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:08.315
and nothing else.

01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:10.450
- Oh good, you came.

01:08:11.486 --> 01:08:12.953
- Oh my God, I did.

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:14.121
- Zack, I...

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:15.289
- Here's the stuff

01:08:15.323 --> 01:08:16.456
you need to say.

01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:17.624
Don't bomb.

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:18.792
- What's a "ligabut?"

01:08:18.827 --> 01:08:20.127
- That's LGBT.

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:21.295
- What's that?

01:08:21.328 --> 01:08:22.296
- Jesus Christ,

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:23.563
I have to get you

01:08:23.598 --> 01:08:24.564
to the green room.

01:08:24.599 --> 01:08:25.564
- Zack, wait,

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.566
I came to apologize.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.567
- Funny,

01:08:27.602 --> 01:08:28.568
originally you said

01:08:28.603 --> 01:08:29.569
you were coming

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:30.837
to support the gay community.

01:08:30.872 --> 01:08:32.339
- You know the gay scene

01:08:32.372 --> 01:08:33.340
isn't really my thing.

01:08:33.374 --> 01:08:34.341
- You know

01:08:34.375 --> 01:08:35.609
for someone who talks down

01:08:35.643 --> 01:08:37.111
on the gay scene so much,

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:38.879
you really go out of your way

01:08:38.913 --> 01:08:41.448
to represent the worst of it.

01:08:47.654 --> 01:08:48.889
- Blowjob for your thoughts?

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.157
- What do you want?

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:51.658
- Come on, all I did

01:08:51.693 --> 01:08:52.926
was prove that the guy

01:08:52.961 --> 01:08:54.194
you thought was your friend

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:55.462
is just a big phony.

01:08:55.496 --> 01:08:56.462
You should be happy.

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:57.464
- You thought

01:08:57.497 --> 01:08:58.966
that sending me your sex video

01:08:59.000 --> 01:08:59.966
would make me happy?

01:09:00.001 --> 01:09:01.468
- I had to do something

01:09:01.502 --> 01:09:02.469
to keep you apart.

01:09:02.502 --> 01:09:03.470
- Why?

01:09:03.504 --> 01:09:04.470
- You know why.

01:09:04.505 --> 01:09:05.471
- Say it.

01:09:05.506 --> 01:09:06.740
- I was jealous, alright?

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:07.741
- I knew it.

01:09:07.774 --> 01:09:09.243
- And it wasn't just that.

01:09:09.277 --> 01:09:10.243
I could tell

01:09:10.278 --> 01:09:11.511
you were connecting with him.

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:12.511
I want you back.

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:13.513
Can you feel

01:09:13.548 --> 01:09:15.015
how badly I want you back?

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.015
- I don't care

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:17.017
how hot you are,

01:09:17.051 --> 01:09:18.018
I need more.

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:19.019
- You're so deep.

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:20.020
- If it's deep

01:09:20.055 --> 01:09:21.020
to want someone

01:09:21.055 --> 01:09:22.189
who's gonna respect me

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.357
and listen to me

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:24.859
and inspire me to do things

01:09:24.893 --> 01:09:26.359
that I'd never thought I'd do.

01:09:26.394 --> 01:09:27.527
Then yeah, I'm deep.

01:09:27.562 --> 01:09:29.029
And you're too shallow for me.

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.296
- Good luck raising money

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.465
for your charity

01:09:31.499 --> 01:09:32.733
without auctioning off my ass

01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:33.901
and my friend's asses.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.069
- You wouldn't,

01:09:35.103 --> 01:09:36.569
this is for the community.

01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:37.738
- Fuck the community.

01:09:37.772 --> 01:09:39.740
- Lionel!

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:44.078
- Hello, hello queers

01:09:44.112 --> 01:09:46.747
and wannabes.

01:09:46.781 --> 01:09:48.082
Welcome to the tenth

01:09:48.116 --> 01:09:50.751
annual male sale.

01:09:50.785 --> 01:09:51.919
Tenth?

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:53.087
I didn't think

01:09:53.121 --> 01:09:54.588
a gay could commit to anything

01:09:54.622 --> 01:09:56.590
for that long.

01:09:56.624 --> 01:09:57.925
I'm Tiffani,

01:09:57.959 --> 01:10:00.594
your mattress of ceremonies.

01:10:00.628 --> 01:10:02.596
- I love that drag queen.

01:10:05.466 --> 01:10:08.435
- Zack, I'm sorry, I...

01:10:12.807 --> 01:10:13.774
- Now's your chance

01:10:13.808 --> 01:10:15.042
to prove you're really here

01:10:15.076 --> 01:10:16.043
to support the community.

01:10:16.077 --> 01:10:17.044
- What?

01:10:17.078 --> 01:10:18.312
- Lionel and his friends

01:10:18.346 --> 01:10:19.579
dropped out of the auction

01:10:19.614 --> 01:10:20.580
and I need you

01:10:20.615 --> 01:10:21.848
and the strip master here

01:10:21.883 --> 01:10:23.117
to get in your boxers

01:10:23.151 --> 01:10:24.385
and let me sell you.

01:10:24.419 --> 01:10:26.153
- Take off my shirt on stage?

01:10:26.187 --> 01:10:27.154
Zack, I'm sorry...

01:10:27.188 --> 01:10:28.422
- This is more important

01:10:28.456 --> 01:10:29.423
than whoever

01:10:29.457 --> 01:10:30.424
you're sleeping with

01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:31.425
or lying to.

01:10:31.459 --> 01:10:32.426
This money helps support

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.427
the Matthew Shepard

01:10:33.461 --> 01:10:34.428

01:10:36.464 --> 01:10:37.431
the Matthew Shepard hotline

01:10:37.465 --> 01:10:38.432
and the Matthew Shepard

01:10:38.466 --> 01:10:40.434
homeless synchronized swim team.

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:43.437
- Alright,

01:10:43.471 --> 01:10:44.771
finally let's get

01:10:44.806 --> 01:10:47.774
to the prostituting.

01:10:47.809 --> 01:10:50.277
Auctioning.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.779
Bring out the meat.

01:10:52.814 --> 01:10:54.514
For our first stud

01:10:54.549 --> 01:10:58.185
we have Lionel!

01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:05.192
Casey!

01:11:05.226 --> 01:11:06.360
- Woo, Casey!

01:11:06.394 --> 01:11:07.861
You go boy!

01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:09.029
- Look at his

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:12.699
rippling muscles and sexy...

01:11:12.733 --> 01:11:13.867
I'm sorry,

01:11:13.901 --> 01:11:15.135
this was for the guy

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.271
we were supposed to have.

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:23.944
Look at his...personality.

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:26.113
Casey is an out of towner

01:11:26.147 --> 01:11:27.281
that enjoys

01:11:27.315 --> 01:11:29.283
cruising online for Zack,

01:11:29.317 --> 01:11:30.617
talking about Zack,

01:11:30.651 --> 01:11:33.787
and working at Nail Me Salon.

Located at

01:11:36.491 --> 01:11:38.459
call for an appointment.

01:11:38.493 --> 01:11:41.128
Take off your shirt!

01:11:41.162 --> 01:11:44.631
Ok, now we're talking.

01:11:44.665 --> 01:11:46.367
Have you ever seen

01:11:46.401 --> 01:11:50.371
such white flesh.

01:11:50.405 --> 01:11:51.538
Ok, let's get

01:11:51.572 --> 01:11:52.706
the bidding started.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.874
Who's gonna be first?

01:11:53.908 --> 01:11:55.042
50 dollars,

01:11:55.076 --> 01:11:56.543
we got a 50 dollar bid,

01:11:56.577 --> 01:11:57.711
who's gonna give me

01:11:57.745 --> 01:12:00.047
a 50 dollar bid?

01:12:00.081 --> 01:12:01.215
- 10 dollars!

01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:02.483
- Bidding starts at 50,

01:12:02.517 --> 01:12:03.650
bitches.

01:12:03.684 --> 01:12:04.651
- 11!

01:12:04.685 --> 01:12:05.919
- Take off your pants.

01:12:05.953 --> 01:12:06.920
- What?

01:12:06.954 --> 01:12:08.922
- We are desperate here.

01:12:08.956 --> 01:12:10.090
And while

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:11.091
you're stripping down

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:12.259
to your beautiful

01:12:12.293 --> 01:12:13.427
Andrew Christian briefs,

01:12:13.461 --> 01:12:14.694
why don't you tell us

01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:17.864
what the Matthew Sh'PARD program

01:12:17.899 --> 01:12:19.166
at the center

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.668
means to you.

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.518
- I used to think

01:12:37.552 --> 01:12:39.019
the center didn't apply to me

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:40.187
at all.

01:12:40.221 --> 01:12:41.522
I thought it was

01:12:41.556 --> 01:12:43.524
just a bunch of old guys

01:12:43.558 --> 01:12:46.360
looking to get their rocks off.

01:12:46.394 --> 01:12:48.362
But a friend

01:12:48.396 --> 01:12:50.197
forced me to volunteer here

01:12:50.231 --> 01:12:51.365
where I met

01:12:51.399 --> 01:12:54.535
one of these old guys

01:12:54.569 --> 01:12:58.038
face to face.

01:12:58.073 --> 01:13:00.707
Boy, was I wrong.

01:13:00.741 --> 01:13:02.543
He was a caring person,

01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:03.710
emptying his wallet

01:13:03.744 --> 01:13:04.878
and busting his ass

01:13:04.912 --> 01:13:06.046
to make sure

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:07.214
that people like me

01:13:07.248 --> 01:13:08.382
don't have to go

01:13:08.416 --> 01:13:09.550
through the shit

01:13:09.584 --> 01:13:11.051
that people like him had to.

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.219
And he's just

01:13:12.253 --> 01:13:13.987
one of the dozens of people here

01:13:14.021 --> 01:13:15.155
trying to help

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:18.658
thousands of kids like me.

01:13:18.693 --> 01:13:20.160
I started this summer

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:23.330
feeling at odds

01:13:23.364 --> 01:13:25.165
with the gay community

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.502
but now

01:13:28.536 --> 01:13:30.003
I look out at your faces

01:13:30.037 --> 01:13:33.507
and I see a friend

01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:34.674
who will do anything

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:35.842
to protect the people

01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:37.511
close to her.

01:13:37.545 --> 01:13:38.678
An example for me

01:13:38.713 --> 01:13:41.348
to aspire to.

01:13:41.382 --> 01:13:44.851
A bitch when you need one.

01:13:44.885 --> 01:13:46.186
A family

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:47.687
that won't let you fail

01:13:47.722 --> 01:13:48.855
even when you've

01:13:48.889 --> 01:13:51.858
already given up on yourself.

01:13:51.892 --> 01:13:53.026
And a leader,

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.294
who can change the way

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:55.462
we see each other

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:56.630
and teach us

01:13:56.664 --> 01:13:57.797
about the things

01:13:57.832 --> 01:13:59.533
that really matter.

01:14:01.068 --> 01:14:03.870
And I couldn't be prouder

01:14:03.904 --> 01:14:05.372
to be a part of this.

01:14:05.406 --> 01:14:06.540
- 100 dollars.

01:14:06.574 --> 01:14:08.041
- 200 dollars.

01:14:08.075 --> 01:14:10.043
- 500 dollars.

01:14:11.078 --> 01:14:12.379
- This is an

01:14:12.413 --> 01:14:15.715
unexpected surprise.

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:17.717
500 dollars,

01:14:17.752 --> 01:14:19.219
we have a 500 dollar bid,

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:21.221
who's gonna give me 600?

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:24.224
- 3,200 dollars.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:26.560
- What?

01:14:27.595 --> 01:14:31.064
- 3,200 dollars.

01:14:31.098 --> 01:14:32.566
- Not to be rude

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.733
or anything but,

01:14:33.768 --> 01:14:34.901
bitch, do you have

01:14:34.935 --> 01:14:36.069
that kind of money?

01:14:36.103 --> 01:14:37.404
- That's your Italy money.

01:14:37.438 --> 01:14:39.406
- I don't need to go to Italy

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.074
for romance.

01:14:41.108 --> 01:14:43.410
- Sold!

01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.924
- Look at that sweet smile,

01:14:57.958 --> 01:15:01.094
you're precious.

01:15:01.128 --> 01:15:02.929
- Ryan1989,

01:15:02.963 --> 01:15:04.097
you are way hotter

01:15:04.131 --> 01:15:05.265
than your pic.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.268
- I'm so glad I stalked you.

01:15:24.151 --> 01:15:25.385
- It's not as hot

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.553
without your dick

01:15:26.588 --> 01:15:28.021
in the middle.
