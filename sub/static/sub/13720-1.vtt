03:07.522 --> 03:09.399
This is Batman. I've found them.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.611
Tell Cyborg he was right about how
they've been breaking into these places.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.113
Copy <i>that.</i>

03:15.279 --> 03:17.699
<i>Hold your position.
Help is on the wa...</i>

03:28.918 --> 03:31.421
That's what I call a safecracker.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.881
How many times do I have to tell you?

03:34.048 --> 03:36.134
We don't want industrial diamonds.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.303
But, boss...
- Listen to the King, Ten.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.766
Quality over quantity.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.527
Jack, we're on a timetable.

03:54.694 --> 03:56.154
What are you doing out there?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.322
Keeping watch.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.838
Peekaboo, I see you.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.602
Pick a card, any card.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.292
Cute. I can do this all day.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.960
Can you?

04:53.127 --> 04:56.130
Forget it, Jack.
Everybody, take what you can and get out.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.549
Right. Soon as I kill Batman.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.226
No way Batman came here alone.

05:10.603 --> 05:13.064
What, I'm supposed to be worried
about Robin?

05:21.948 --> 05:23.157
Huh?

05:26.619 --> 05:28.496
You might wanna give up now.

05:28.663 --> 05:30.706
Crap. It's the Justice League.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.089
That's three you owe me.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.383
- We keeping score?
- Not literally.

05:40.550 --> 05:43.594
Because if we are, it's 8 to 7, my favor.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.693
- Batman, are you okay?
- I'll live.

06:05.950 --> 06:07.702
So will Ace, apparently.

06:08.244 --> 06:10.454
He's still a little embarrassed
from last time.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.290
He sucker punched me.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.962
I've got Queen.

06:18.129 --> 06:21.132
That leaves Jack. Haven't seen him
since he sicced Ace on me.

06:21.299 --> 06:24.927
Couldn't have gone far. You search the vaults.
I'll take the rest of the building.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.168
Don't bother. I just looked.

06:57.335 --> 06:59.211
- Everywhere?
- The whole complex...

06:59.378 --> 07:01.589
except for the last vault room.
Shall we?

07:01.756 --> 07:05.009
- After you.
- Heh, like you've got a choice.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.349
- Found him.
- You fast enough to go in...

07:11.515 --> 07:13.935
and knock him out
before he glances in your direction?

07:14.310 --> 07:16.771
We could wait
until his eye laser runs out of power.

07:16.938 --> 07:19.941
Flank him. I'll make sure he stays inside
until you get there.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.151
That will work too.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.866
All right, now come the warning shots.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.536
Give up? Please say no.

07:32.703 --> 07:35.331
You'll never catch me, Lantern.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.000
Lots of women say that.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.967
Bang.

08:22.420 --> 08:23.754
Say good night, Ace.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.775
Surrender peacefully.
You will not be harmed.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.194
Really don't think so, martian.

09:04.462 --> 09:07.631
Come on in. I'll kill you where you stand.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.385
Trying to make me look away?

09:11.552 --> 09:12.803
It's not gonna work.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.140
I'm pretty sure it is, Jack.

09:19.602 --> 09:20.811
J'onn!

09:21.520 --> 09:24.398
I am unharmed.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.823
Intangibility. Works every time.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.659
- What?
- King escaped me.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.661
He was headed in that direction.

09:55.805 --> 09:58.307
Don't think so, Your Highness.

10:00.309 --> 10:03.687
Handheld plasma generator. Nice work.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.482
Hey, guys. You missed one,
but I got him for you.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.778
What were you doing here?
I thought you were helping.

10:10.945 --> 10:12.029
I am helping.

10:12.196 --> 10:16.200
Batman thought your robbery spree was
being done with extra-dimensional tech.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.618
You were right by the way.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.788
I asked him to consult
because his father did work in the field.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.541
Since Dad passed,
I'm the world's ranking expert...

10:23.707 --> 10:25.417
in multi-dimensional interface.

10:25.584 --> 10:29.046
The Royal Flush Gang knows more
about this tech than you?

10:29.213 --> 10:31.590
Somebody does, but not these mooks.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.468
Flying playing cards is one thing,
but this?

10:34.635 --> 10:39.056
Agreed, this isn't even their standard MO.
Anything on the hard drive?

10:39.223 --> 10:42.017
A lot. I'm still sorting it all out.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.397
Wake up, King.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.190
Got some questions for you.

10:49.567 --> 10:52.528
- I want a lawyer.
- You're getting ahead of yourself.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.322
First, you want a doctor,
then you want a lawyer.

10:55.865 --> 10:57.825
Diana, would you be so kind?

11:01.537 --> 11:04.206
You sure know how to take the fun
out of an interrogation.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.585
Who gave you the technology
that allows you to walk through walls?

11:08.043 --> 11:09.753
I do not know.

11:10.296 --> 11:12.715
The lasso compels you to tell the truth.

11:12.882 --> 11:14.675
I do not know.

11:16.051 --> 11:20.389
- I know you don't like to do it, J'onn...
- Not unnecessarily.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.900
I've read the minds of his entire group.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.444
None of them knows the origin
of the device.

11:33.611 --> 11:35.613
Then we haven't found
the end of the thread.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.615
We've found all we're going to tonight.

11:37.781 --> 11:41.535
I'll take these guys to booking. The rest
of you can sleep on what we've learned.

11:41.702 --> 11:45.206
- I don't need to sleep, I need to follow up...
- Your injuries are severe.

11:45.372 --> 11:49.376
If you wish, a session with my healing ray
could save you days of recovery time.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.920
I'm fine, Diana.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.379
Well, I'm tired.

11:52.546 --> 11:56.258
Unless something comes up, we'll
reconvene at the meeting on Thursday.

11:56.425 --> 11:59.136
I think we could search the hard drive
on the device for...

11:59.303 --> 12:01.472
I've got 16 petabytes of data
to sort through.

12:01.639 --> 12:05.226
I'll call you as soon
as I've got something. Honest.

12:15.236 --> 12:17.738
<i>Authorized vehicle operator recognized.</i>

12:17.905 --> 12:20.491
<i>Security systems disarmed.</i>

12:51.522 --> 12:53.732
Late night playing cards, Master Bruce?

12:53.899 --> 12:56.694
Something like that. How did you know?

12:58.028 --> 13:01.532
I believe tradition calls
for hiding these up one's sleeves.

13:01.699 --> 13:03.200
Was that sarcasm, Alfred?

13:03.367 --> 13:04.702
Mild teasing, at best.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.288
I'm being uncharacteristically gentle
with you...

13:07.454 --> 13:11.208
mainly because you're bleeding
all over my nice clean floor.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.671
Not going to let me go to work.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.589
That is correct, Master Bruce.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.259
- Not until you've had medical attention...
- Fine.

13:20.426 --> 13:23.304
Food, and a minimum
of eight hours bed rest.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.888
Let's just get this over with.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.433
I made chicken soup.
You can eat while you brood...

13:27.599 --> 13:31.395
and I'll put in your stitches myself.
It will be delightful, I'm sure.

13:31.562 --> 13:32.604
All right.

13:32.771 --> 13:38.110
By the way, the part about
the stitches? That would be sarcasm.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.703
This is Mirror Master. I'm in.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.246
<i>Then get to work.</i>

13:49.413 --> 13:51.582
<i>This is the most vulnerable moment
of the entire plan.</i>

14:00.341 --> 14:02.009
You sure this thing will work?

14:02.176 --> 14:06.013
<i>For the amount of money
I paid LexCorp, it had better.</i>

14:08.349 --> 14:10.809
I couldn't see anything
while I was in the mirror.

14:10.976 --> 14:14.396
Maybe I should snoop around
and see if I can find out who he really is.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.358
<i>The information I sent you to steal
is far more valuable...</i>

14:17.524 --> 14:19.318
<i>than Batman's secret identity.</i>

14:19.485 --> 14:22.112
<i>Besides, I already know it.</i>

14:22.279 --> 14:24.615
<i>- You know who Batma...?
- Download complete.</i>

15:14.164 --> 15:16.125
It's not broken.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.546
You've arrived.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.464
Star Sapphire.

15:22.631 --> 15:27.302
If this is an elaborate ambush, you won't
fare any better than the alligator.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.721
I suspect we'd do a bit better.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.265
It's Bane, isn't it'?

15:31.432 --> 15:33.934
I'm Metallo. Big fan of your work.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.858
The scary guy's Ma'alefa'ak...

15:41.024 --> 15:44.445
and the lady with the claws
is Cheetah.

16:14.975 --> 16:19.104
- What's that supposed to be?
- An invitation.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.999
Welcome to the Hall of Doom.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.001
I'm Vandal Savage.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.878
I'm pleased to see you all here.

16:43.045 --> 16:46.590
For $10 million,
I'm inclined to accept any invitation.

16:46.757 --> 16:47.925
Makes me wonder, though.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.886
What if we'd just kept the money
and not shown up?

16:51.053 --> 16:53.430
You'd live the rest
of your very short lives...

16:53.597 --> 16:56.433
in fear of the moment
when I would inevitably find you.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.684
Tough talk.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.436
None of us are that easy to kill.

16:59.603 --> 17:02.022
Everybody dies, child.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.107
That's not what I've heard about you.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.529
You five and Mirror Master are here
because you each have...

17:08.694 --> 17:11.698
a personal vendetta
against a member of the Justice League.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.325
You wish to see them dead.

17:13.492 --> 17:15.827
While I have no personal enmity
towards them...

17:15.993 --> 17:19.373
I have a vision for this world,
and they would stand in my way.

17:19.790 --> 17:22.960
Their deaths would serve my goals.

17:24.086 --> 17:27.130
In short, we need each other.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.008
I don't speak for the others,
but I'm perfectly capable...

17:30.175 --> 17:32.177
of killing Wonder Woman by myself.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.930
History says otherwise.

17:35.097 --> 17:39.309
You've all tried and failed to kill members
of the league on multiple occasions.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.312
Savage has foolproof plans
for how we can destroy them.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.649
And I will pay you $100 million,
plus expenses...

17:45.816 --> 17:48.151
for each Justice Leaguer
you take off the table.

17:48.318 --> 17:51.446
Wait a minute. You just committed
over a half a billion dollars...

17:51.613 --> 17:54.992
just to get the JLA out of the way
of another plan?

17:55.158 --> 17:58.662
As Ma'alefa'ak implied earlier,
I'm very old.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.873
Fifty thousand years has been
sufficient time to amass a fortune...

18:02.040 --> 18:04.126
that dwarfs any other
in human history.

18:04.293 --> 18:07.879
Even so, to spend that much money
just to clear the decks...

18:08.046 --> 18:09.756
the payoff must be huge.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.466
Inconceivably so.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.512
Any who would like to continue working
with me are welcome to share in the riches.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.181
After you've destroyed
the Justice League.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.102
I don't see any of us looking for the exit.

18:22.686 --> 18:23.854
Then it's settled.

18:24.605 --> 18:27.858
Welcome to the Legion of Doom.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.743
Master Bruce.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.870
What is it, Alfred?

18:40.912 --> 18:44.541
I have some unpleasant news.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.379
No.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.425
How could this have happened?

18:53.592 --> 18:56.553
Where are my parents' caskets?

18:56.970 --> 18:58.221
I don't know, sir.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.724
We found it like this
just a few minutes ago.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.726
I called the house right away.

19:02.893 --> 19:05.312
Whoever did this is going to pay.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.648
Perhaps I can help you with that.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.361
When I said I didn't know
who was responsible for this...

19:13.737 --> 19:15.322
I may have been lying.

19:15.489 --> 19:16.823
What?

19:33.590 --> 19:35.008
Come on, John.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.551
We actually surprised you?

19:36.718 --> 19:39.930
It's been a busy week.
I'd forgotten it was my birthday.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.099
Also, I'd never mentioned it
to any of you.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.351
Your stalker knows all.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.770
She really likes you, you know.

19:54.528 --> 19:57.781
I didn't know how old you were,
so I just put a lot.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.204
You're supposed to wait for us
to sing "Happy Birthday."

20:04.371 --> 20:07.791
Ugh, I hope you at least made a wish.

20:10.127 --> 20:11.294
I didn't order that.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.130
It's from the lady.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.300
Do you know her?

20:17.467 --> 20:19.302
I do not.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.641
Thank you for the drink, but I'm on duty.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.977
I figured. It's a soda.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.483
- Got a light?
- I don't smoke.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.612
You seem very familiar.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.239
You don't need a line, John.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.616
I'm obviously interested in you.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.452
I can't place your face.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.287
That's unusual for me.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.205
Really look.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.124
Use your martian vision.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.042
How do you...?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.764
What do you want, Cheetah?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.349
To hurt you, Diana. What else?

21:24.785 --> 21:25.994
Hey, can we wrap this up?

21:26.161 --> 21:29.122
We're blocking traffic,
and it's obvious what happened here.

21:29.414 --> 21:30.457
Is it?

21:30.624 --> 21:33.710
Come on, Allen,
don't do this to me again.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.880
The facts don't fit the scenario.
- You guys hear the news?

21:37.047 --> 21:40.425
You mean the part where I blow
my date tonight and therefore die alone...

21:40.592 --> 21:43.136
because Allen turned my hit-and-run
into a homicide?

21:43.303 --> 21:47.557
I'm serious. Mirror Master's robbing
the new maglev train from Keystone City.

21:47.724 --> 21:52.562
Bag and tag everything, and be thorough.
This is a murder, not an accident.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.898
- Where you going?
- Train station.

21:55.065 --> 21:58.151
For what? It's a robbery in progress,
not a crime scene.

21:58.318 --> 22:01.905
Mirror Master's there.
It'll be a crime scene soon enough.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.384
Who's the officer in charge?

22:22.551 --> 22:24.928
Special Agent Porter.
My office reached out to you.

22:25.095 --> 22:28.515
An unknown number of heavily armed
militiamen have taken over the mine.

22:28.682 --> 22:31.560
A salt mine? For what?

22:31.726 --> 22:34.187
They call themselves
the Identity Brotherhood.

22:34.354 --> 22:38.358
They plan to use the salt mine as their base
during the second American revolution...

22:38.525 --> 22:40.402
which is, they claim, imminent.

22:40.569 --> 22:43.113
They've killed a dozen people,
wounded three of my men.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.699
- Why not go in hard and take them down?
- I'd like to.

22:45.866 --> 22:49.327
But they have at least six hostages,
workers, trapped down there with them.

22:49.494 --> 22:52.289
We hoped you might be able
to take a more subtle approach...

22:52.455 --> 22:54.416
than the responses we have available.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.792
Got it.

22:56.626 --> 22:59.713
This is Green Lantern. I'm coming in.

22:59.880 --> 23:03.967
If you harm any of those hostages,
you'll answer to me.

23:04.134 --> 23:05.260
Back in five.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.341
- Flash.
- Mirror Master's in here.

23:44.507 --> 23:47.761
- One at a time.
- We're shipping old cash to the reserve.

23:47.928 --> 23:50.555
- Old cash?
- It's being taken out of circulation.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.849
It'll be destroyed
and replaced with new bills.

23:53.016 --> 23:56.770
Unless Mirror Master steals it first,
which ain't gonna happen on my watch.

23:56.937 --> 24:01.107
Yeah. I just untied you, remember?
You're lucky he let you live.

24:01.274 --> 24:03.860
Stay here and I'll take a crack at him.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.870
Took you long enough to get here.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.872
I brought you something.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.209
I thought this was a robbery.

24:19.376 --> 24:22.295
It looks more like you're doing
the feds' work for them.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.885
Hologram. Figures.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.806
Which one of us is real?

24:32.973 --> 24:34.557
I don't care.

25:00.458 --> 25:04.838
What did you do with their bodies?

25:05.005 --> 25:08.925
When we fought before, I broke the bat.

25:09.092 --> 25:12.846
Today, I break the man.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.440
Come on, I'm not gonna kill you yet.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.108
What's in the box?

25:25.275 --> 25:26.526
Dead grandma.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.486
- What kind of sick...?
- Relax.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.280
I got a little ahead of myself.

25:30.447 --> 25:34.242
You can hardly blame me
trying to keep up with the likes of you.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.121
She's still alive.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.752
Don't move.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.212
You really wanna hear all this first.

25:46.379 --> 25:49.466
I call this my hostage box.

25:49.632 --> 25:52.343
At the end of the countdown,
already in progress...

25:52.510 --> 25:55.805
the box will activate
and instantly kill the old woman...

25:55.972 --> 25:58.975
unless you use your super-speed
to get her out.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.436
- It's a trap.
- Most probably...

26:01.603 --> 26:05.273
but you can't take that chance,
or pass up the challenge.

26:05.648 --> 26:08.318
Are you fast enough, Flash?

26:13.656 --> 26:16.409
Careful. It's bolted through your wrist.

26:16.826 --> 26:20.663
- What?
- It's a bomb with a three-mile blast radius.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.916
If you try to remove the bomb,
it explodes.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.044
If you do nothing in 60 seconds,
it explodes.

26:26.211 --> 26:29.339
Before you heroically leave the train
to protect the passengers...

26:29.506 --> 26:30.965
there's one last thing.

26:31.132 --> 26:34.010
Once you start running,
if you decelerate...

26:34.177 --> 26:35.345
It explodes.

26:35.512 --> 26:37.972
You've got 12 seconds
to decide what to do.

26:38.139 --> 26:42.602
I don't much care which way you go
because I'm not really here.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.030
Why are you here, Ma'alefa'ak?

26:54.197 --> 26:55.698
To buy you a drink.

26:55.865 --> 27:00.286
It's laced with a chemical
that has an odd effect on martian biology.

27:00.453 --> 27:03.039
You couldn't taste it over the soda.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.710
It's a poison.

27:07.877 --> 27:13.216
Oh, it won't kill you.
Your body will filter it out in a few hours.

27:14.050 --> 27:19.139
Unfortunately, you'll sweat the poison
out of your pores.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.558
It's magnesium, by the way.

27:21.724 --> 27:22.851
No.

27:26.354 --> 27:29.232
- John.
- That guy just fell down.

27:29.399 --> 27:31.401
What's the matter,
can't hold your liquor?

27:31.568 --> 27:34.028
Oh, man.

27:34.195 --> 27:36.072
He's the freaking Martian Manhunter.

27:39.742 --> 27:42.620
Listen, you must get everyone
away from me.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.914
You're all in grave danger.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.883
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's get out of here.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.552
Hold on, John.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.187
Stop, drop and roll, partner.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.230
Hang in there, we'll get this...

28:16.362 --> 28:18.448
He doesn't smoke.

28:20.283 --> 28:22.243
I think that guy's gonna jump.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.370
- Does anybody know him?
- I don't know.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.456
- Can you see him?
- Working on it, Lois.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.084
I think that guy works for our paper.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.386
The bond issue should easily cover
the budget shortfall...

28:40.553 --> 28:43.056
into the third quarter
of our next fiscal year.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.476
We all know the federal money
was a one-time thing...

28:46.643 --> 28:49.145
- to help boost the economy.
- Hello?

28:49.312 --> 28:51.439
<i>It's me.
You know Henry Ackerdson?</i>

28:51.856 --> 28:54.442
Used to be White House beat,
got downsized.

28:54.609 --> 28:57.904
- He was a good reporter. A real shame.
- It's about to be a bigger shame.

28:58.071 --> 29:00.281
He's going to jump off of the top
of the Daily Planet.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.408
I'm on my way.

29:12.877 --> 29:14.462
That's far enough, Lantern.

29:14.879 --> 29:19.175
You make a move, any move, and that drill's
coming down on their heads.

29:19.342 --> 29:23.346
You're not in a position to make a deal.
Step away from the control panel...

29:23.513 --> 29:26.349
and you won't get hurt.
There's no other way out of this.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.653
The shut-off is controlled
from one of the other consoles.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.822
I'll tell you which one if you let me go.

30:02.385 --> 30:07.890
That bracelet trick always impresses me,
but at least I got you once.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.734
You drugged me.

30:18.568 --> 30:20.653
Catch me if you can.

30:26.743 --> 30:29.245
It's not possible.

30:29.579 --> 30:32.165
- Wonder Woman.
- Look, it's Wonder Woman.

30:32.332 --> 30:33.666
- It's Wonder Woman.
- No way.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.710
- Wonder Woman.
- What's she doing here?

30:35.877 --> 30:38.087
Wonder Woman.
- Dude, she's so hot.

30:38.254 --> 30:41.007
- Is it really her?
- Is that Wonder Woman?

30:41.174 --> 30:43.760
Why is she looking at us like that?

30:47.347 --> 30:50.600
- Hey, is that...?
- There he is!

30:53.436 --> 30:55.146
Mr. Ackerdson?

30:55.313 --> 30:56.522
May I call you Henry?

30:56.689 --> 30:58.316
Call me whatever you want.

30:58.483 --> 31:00.193
It doesn't matter.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.861
Nothing does.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.614
I'm going to have
to disagree with you, sir.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.366
Everything matters.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.867
Everybody matters.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.411
Don't come any closer. I'll do it.

31:11.454 --> 31:13.539
I'm staying right here.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.382
I want you to get out of here
as quickly as you can.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.134
Follow the light,
it's a safe path back to the surface.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.428
- They've still got Carol.
- Carol?

31:27.595 --> 31:30.139
From Bookkeeping.
They took her hostage first.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.642
I'll get her out. Go.

32:06.843 --> 32:08.302
Help me.

32:09.303 --> 32:10.888
Don't hurt her.

32:11.055 --> 32:12.390
It'll do you no good.

32:12.557 --> 32:14.809
All your partners are captured, or worse.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.103
- All of them?
- All of them.

32:17.270 --> 32:19.188
You've got no options.

32:20.314 --> 32:22.275
I've got one.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.211
No.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.553
I don't understand.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.346
Why didn't I disarm him?

32:52.513 --> 32:54.182
Why didn't I... '?

32:56.476 --> 32:57.643
Oh, no.

33:04.025 --> 33:05.943
I'm so sorry.

33:07.195 --> 33:09.822
She sort of looks like me, doesn't she?

33:12.742 --> 33:13.743
Carol?

33:13.910 --> 33:17.288
Yes. Her name was Carol too.

33:17.455 --> 33:21.209
She's beautiful, of course,
and she has dark hair like mine.

33:21.375 --> 33:24.587
And the stench of your failure
hanging over her.

33:25.171 --> 33:26.214
I didn't mean...

33:26.380 --> 33:28.925
You didn't mean
to get all those people killed?

33:29.091 --> 33:34.013
You didn't mean to betray me,
drive me into becoming this?

33:34.597 --> 33:37.266
What didn't you mean, Hal?

33:37.433 --> 33:39.185
I don't know. I'm...

33:39.352 --> 33:40.561
Afraid?

33:40.728 --> 33:43.856
Afraid that you don't deserve
to have so much power?

33:44.023 --> 33:46.526
That nobody does?

33:47.443 --> 33:48.611
Yes.

33:49.445 --> 33:51.322
I don't deserve this.

33:51.489 --> 33:54.700
Then I hope you have the decency
to do what's right...

33:54.867 --> 33:58.120
and suffer for your many sins.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.520
You don't understand.

34:22.687 --> 34:25.022
I've been a newspaperman for 40 years.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.192
I started as a copyboy when I was 16.

34:28.359 --> 34:32.154
Always thought I'd be doing it
until the day I died.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.782
Heh, guess I got that part right.

34:34.949 --> 34:36.909
There are other jobs

34:37.076 --> 34:39.203
Newspapers are dying.

34:39.370 --> 34:44.083
I spent my life fighting for the little
guy, fighting for truth and justice.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.043
It isn't relevant any more.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.004
That's what some people say.

34:48.170 --> 34:51.799
But I've fought for the same things,
even when they don't seem fashionable.

34:51.966 --> 34:55.886
It's a never-ending battle,
but we can't quit.

34:57.305 --> 35:00.182
I'm not the man you think I am.

35:00.349 --> 35:02.685
I'm too weak to fight any more.

35:02.852 --> 35:05.479
You're stronger than you know,
Mr. Ackerdson.

35:23.706 --> 35:25.458
Kryptonite bullet.

35:30.046 --> 35:31.839
Kryptonite heart.

36:20.096 --> 36:21.681
No!

36:31.941 --> 36:33.275
Hello, Bruce.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.653
<i>Sorry I couldn '1' be
there for this...</i>

36:35.820 --> 36:38.656
<i>but I have a rather large check
to pick up.</i>

36:38.823 --> 36:41.409
<i>Payment for dealing with you.</i>

36:41.575 --> 36:46.080
<i>Oh, you were concerned
about where I put your parents.</i>

36:46.247 --> 36:47.373
<i>Don't be.</i>

36:47.540 --> 36:49.583
<i>They're very close.</i>

36:53.045 --> 36:54.797
<i>Rest in peace.</i>

37:19.947 --> 37:22.491
It was easier than I thought.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.243
To victory.

37:24.410 --> 37:25.661
To victory.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.580
To the Legion of Doom.

37:27.747 --> 37:29.665
To the Legion of Doom.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.334
Wait. A further toast.

37:32.501 --> 37:35.838
I've been trying to kill Batman
for nearly 10 years.

37:36.005 --> 37:39.884
Well, this time,
I did better than kill him...

37:40.050 --> 37:42.178
I humiliated him.

37:42.344 --> 37:43.804
Hear, hear.

37:43.971 --> 37:46.724
Each of us finally got the better
of our opposite numbers...

37:46.891 --> 37:50.019
and it's all thanks
to the genius of one man...

37:50.186 --> 37:51.854
Vandal Savage.

37:52.021 --> 37:54.064
- Yes, he's the man.
- Ha, ha, to the man.

37:54.231 --> 37:56.692
- And his checks clear.
- I love my money.

38:02.364 --> 38:04.492
Our business is completed.

38:04.658 --> 38:06.660
You are, of course, free to go.

38:07.036 --> 38:10.623
You hinted at a larger scheme and said
there would be a place for us in it...

38:10.790 --> 38:11.957
should we so choose.

38:12.583 --> 38:13.709
I did.

38:13.876 --> 38:16.295
And the offer remains open to you all.

38:16.462 --> 38:19.632
But I fear you may lack the vision
to go along with me.

38:20.090 --> 38:23.052
The next stage of my plans
might be considered...

38:23.219 --> 38:24.804
genocidal.

38:25.387 --> 38:27.807
What are you gonna do,
destroy the world?

38:27.973 --> 38:29.725
Nothing so crude.

38:29.892 --> 38:32.686
Half. Two-thirds at the most.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.234
It's not a joke.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.487
It's the next step in a plan
to transform the planet in a manner...

38:41.654 --> 38:47.368
that will render your $100-million
payday both trivial and meaningless.

38:47.535 --> 38:51.330
What possible profit could there be
in destroying the world?

38:51.497 --> 38:54.834
The first thing you have to understand
is that I am old.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.585
Older than the human race.

38:56.752 --> 38:59.380
I know that you believe this to be true.

38:59.922 --> 39:02.132
It is true.

39:02.842 --> 39:04.885
<i>Eighty thousand years ago...</i>

39:05.052 --> 39:08.597
<i>I was living in
what is now the island of Sumatra.</i>

39:09.557 --> 39:13.060
<i>One night,
the sky lit up with streaks of fire</i>

39:13.435 --> 39:15.145
<i>Meteors.</i>

39:15.312 --> 39:19.567
<i>But my primitive mind thought the stars
were falling from the sky.</i>

39:24.947 --> 39:27.533
<i>One meteor fell to
Earth in my valley.</i>

39:27.700 --> 39:29.660
<i>My compatriots</i> ran...

39:29.827 --> 39:34.623
<i>but it was very cold
and the glowing stone was warm.</i>

39:39.086 --> 39:40.629
<i>I slept there...</i>

39:40.796 --> 39:44.091
<i>bathed in the meteor's
strange radiations.</i>

39:44.258 --> 39:49.138
<i>And when I awoke the next morning,
I was forever changed.</i>

39:51.348 --> 39:54.852
<i>The radiation mutated
me, evolving me.</i>

39:55.019 --> 39:58.689
<i>I was instantly aware
of my increased intelligence.</i>

40:00.608 --> 40:05.487
It was only with the passage of time
that I discovered the rest of my gift.

40:05.654 --> 40:09.658
So far as I know, I cannot die.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.327
Is that a fact?

40:12.077 --> 40:13.329
Go ahead.

40:24.798 --> 40:27.468
- Why'd you do that?
- Don't you realize what he's planning?

40:27.635 --> 40:30.679
In his new world,
our money doesn't matter.

40:33.349 --> 40:34.767
You are correct.

40:34.934 --> 40:36.352
Money won't matter.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.354
It's trivial in the long run.

40:41.023 --> 40:43.317
Let me tell you about the long run.

40:43.484 --> 40:44.860
I've lived thousands of lives.

40:45.027 --> 40:49.949
I've been a laborer, a scientist, a priest,
an artist, a healer, a thief.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.952
But most often a conqueror.

40:55.955 --> 40:58.540
I'm still not seeing
how this makes up for my money.

40:59.041 --> 41:02.127
Seventy-five thousand years ago...

41:02.294 --> 41:04.964
<i>a disaster
nearly rendered humanity extinct.</i>

41:05.130 --> 41:09.176
<i>I enslaved the survivors
and ruled with an iron hand.</i>

41:09.343 --> 41:10.678
<i>In a few generations...</i>

41:10.844 --> 41:13.764
<i>my people were well under way
to repopulating the Earth...</i>

41:13.931 --> 41:17.559
<i>and becoming the planet's
dominant species.</i>

41:17.726 --> 41:20.062
I was happy then.

41:20.229 --> 41:22.898
You're taking the world over
out of nostalgia?

41:23.065 --> 41:26.819
I'm taking over because humanity
is prideful and belligerent...

41:26.986 --> 41:29.530
and once again
needs my guiding hand.

41:29.697 --> 41:33.075
But before I take over,
I intend to soften them up.

41:33.242 --> 41:35.869
By destroying half the world.

41:36.036 --> 41:38.414
Those who survive
will happily follow a leader...

41:38.580 --> 41:41.417
who offers food, comfort and order.

41:41.583 --> 41:42.835
That could work.

41:43.002 --> 41:44.753
It will work.

41:44.920 --> 41:49.550
To you, my warlords, I offer dominion over
as much of what remains of the planet...

41:49.717 --> 41:53.762
as each of you can hold,
second only to me.

41:53.929 --> 41:55.431
Interested?

41:55.597 --> 41:57.725
You haven't left us much choice.

41:57.891 --> 42:01.270
Heh, how do you propose
to kill that many people?

42:01.437 --> 42:04.773
Even without the Justice League,
they will fight.

42:05.482 --> 42:07.735
They'll lose.

43:52.047 --> 43:53.966
Why are you guys
attacking Wonder Woman?

43:54.550 --> 43:56.093
Get out of my face, tin man.

43:56.260 --> 43:59.847
I've had enough trouble with superheroes
today to last me a lifetime.

44:00.013 --> 44:03.725
Not as much as you're gonna have
if you don't give me a straight answer.

44:03.892 --> 44:07.187
She was fighting the Cheetah,
then suddenly started attacking everyone.

44:07.354 --> 44:09.690
We got the civilians out
and the park sealed off...

44:09.857 --> 44:11.191
but we can't get near her.

44:11.358 --> 44:13.485
Look at her.
She's having a seizure or something.

44:18.490 --> 44:19.575
You could be right.

44:19.741 --> 44:22.661
Her pulse, blood pressure and respiration
are off the charts.

44:22.828 --> 44:25.372
If she keeps going at that pace,
she's gonna drop dead.

44:25.539 --> 44:28.000
That's not the worst outcome
I can imagine right now.

44:28.167 --> 44:31.503
I'm gonna talk her down.
Pull your men back.

44:32.254 --> 44:34.715
All officers,
stand down and retreat to barriers.

44:34.882 --> 44:36.925
Repeat, stand down.

44:46.310 --> 44:47.936
You must be the real one.

44:48.103 --> 44:51.190
Whatever that weapon is, Cheetah,
it won't work.

44:51.356 --> 44:54.234
It's a scanner.
Something's happening to you.

44:54.401 --> 44:55.903
Did you just call me Cheetah?

45:01.825 --> 45:03.243
She thinks I'm Cheetah.

45:22.137 --> 45:24.264
Wonder Woman,
just listen for a minute.

45:24.973 --> 45:27.601
Whatever it looks like, I'm not Cheetah.

45:27.768 --> 45:31.980
Think about it. All those dozens
of Cheetahs you saw, how is that possible?

45:32.147 --> 45:33.565
I don't know.

45:33.732 --> 45:34.816
I think I do.

45:35.234 --> 45:37.444
My sensors have detected
a cluster of nanomachines...

45:37.611 --> 45:38.987
attached to your brain stem.

45:40.155 --> 45:43.325
They're broadcasting
into your visual and auditory centers...

45:43.492 --> 45:45.786
making you see
whatever Cheetah wants you to.

45:46.662 --> 45:49.081
- It could be.
- It is.

45:49.248 --> 45:51.083
She knows you'll never quit a fight.

45:51.250 --> 45:53.669
You're supposed to keep going
until your heart gives out...

45:53.835 --> 45:57.464
or you have an aneurism,
or a cop gets lucky and shoots you.

45:57.631 --> 46:00.342
I've identified the frequency.
I'm gonna broadcast inter...

46:00.509 --> 46:01.677
No!

46:08.517 --> 46:11.436
I'm sorry you forced me to do this,
Cheetah.

46:13.855 --> 46:16.024
Let's get you some medical attention.

46:18.777 --> 46:20.529
After you.

46:33.292 --> 46:34.376
Cyborg?

46:34.543 --> 46:35.627
That's me, all right.

46:36.545 --> 46:40.382
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on here?

46:45.554 --> 46:46.638
Where have you been?

46:46.805 --> 46:49.599
When I saw the grave restored,
I assumed you'd gone after...

46:49.766 --> 46:50.809
Later. I'm busy.

46:52.227 --> 46:55.147
Bruce, Superman's been shot.

46:57.316 --> 47:00.068
<i>Surgeons bought to the
scene have been unable to operate.</i>

47:00.235 --> 47:05.073
<i>Superman's invulnerable flesh has thus
far resisted all attempts to cut...</i>

47:05.240 --> 47:08.076
Flash, listen carefully.
Go to S.T.A.R. Labs Kyoto...

47:08.243 --> 47:11.496
and have them forge a piece of
kryptonite into a scalpel. Bring it...

47:11.663 --> 47:14.583
Can't help you. I've got a bomb
bolted to my wrist. If I stop...

47:14.750 --> 47:17.753
- It'll explode.
- Yeah. I'm starting to get tired.

47:17.919 --> 47:19.921
I'll have to try something soon.

47:20.088 --> 47:22.549
Keep running. I'll call back when I can.

47:22.716 --> 47:24.926
How did you know
what was happening to Flash?

47:25.093 --> 47:26.553
J'onn, I need your help. J'onn?

47:27.929 --> 47:30.307
<i>J'onn? J'onn!</i>

47:34.353 --> 47:35.896
It's Batman. What's happening?

47:36.063 --> 47:37.439
Batman!

47:37.606 --> 47:39.524
I'm still burning!

47:40.108 --> 47:42.861
Get the Batwing ready.
The Justice League is under attack.

47:43.028 --> 47:45.781
'BY Whom? 'BY me.

47:56.375 --> 47:57.834
<i>Batman to Justice</i> League.

47:58.001 --> 47:59.044
Wonder Woman here.

47:59.211 --> 48:01.004
<i>- Are you all right?
- I am now.</i>

48:01.171 --> 48:02.381
I'm with Cyborg.

48:02.547 --> 48:05.717
Bring him. The plans don't account
for him. He could be the key.

48:05.884 --> 48:07.886
<i>Key to what?
What's going on, Batman?</i>

48:08.053 --> 48:09.096
<i>Do you know something?</i>

48:09.262 --> 48:11.264
<i>The Justice League
is in extreme danger.</i>

48:11.431 --> 48:14.768
You don't say. Listen, I can't keep running.
I think I can vibrate...

48:14.935 --> 48:17.145
No. It won't work. You have to trust me.

48:17.312 --> 48:18.438
<i>You got a better idea?</i>

48:18.605 --> 48:21.274
Slightly. How far away are you
from an iceberg?

48:21.441 --> 48:24.778
I'm never far from anything.
You think that'll slow it down enough?

48:24.945 --> 48:27.406
<i>- Just. But you make one misstep...
- Got it.</i>

48:27.572 --> 48:30.450
At least if it doesn't work,
nobody dies but me.

49:19.583 --> 49:21.376
Argh!

49:25.839 --> 49:28.341
Flash. Flash, are you okay?

49:32.888 --> 49:38.226
Not the way I would have bet
two seconds ago, but, yeah, I'm fine.

49:38.393 --> 49:40.145
Now, everyone, listen very carefully.

49:40.312 --> 49:42.606
We can still save
Superman and Green Lantern...

49:42.772 --> 49:45.734
if you do exactly what I say.

49:51.740 --> 49:52.824
How are you feeling?

49:53.325 --> 49:54.743
Fine.

49:54.910 --> 49:56.745
You injected me with aluminum oxide?

49:56.912 --> 49:59.080
On Batman's instruction.

49:59.247 --> 50:00.540
Interesting.

50:00.707 --> 50:02.584
It's harmless to my martian physiology...

50:02.751 --> 50:06.922
but ideal for neutralizing the magnesium
I was secreting.

50:07.088 --> 50:08.840
How did he know?

50:09.007 --> 50:10.592
We'll ask him when we see him.

50:10.759 --> 50:12.761
Right now, you have to prep for surgery.

50:25.065 --> 50:26.107
Hal.

50:26.650 --> 50:27.901
Hal, listen to me.

50:28.068 --> 50:31.029
However it looks, this wasn't your fault.

50:31.196 --> 50:33.448
Who's fault was it, then?

50:33.615 --> 50:37.118
I was the one with the most powerful
weapon in the universe.

50:37.285 --> 50:41.122
I was the one whose arrogance
led to this girl's death.

50:41.665 --> 50:44.209
I know more than a little
about arrogance.

50:44.376 --> 50:48.088
I also know about dead bodies,
and that isn't one.

50:51.299 --> 50:53.093
She's a sophisticated android.

50:53.260 --> 50:54.678
They all were.

50:54.844 --> 50:58.890
The entire scenario was created
to convince you that you made a bad call.

50:59.307 --> 51:01.142
But you didn't.

51:01.309 --> 51:02.936
- I was afraid that...
- No.

51:03.103 --> 51:05.397
You weren't afraid. Not really.

51:05.564 --> 51:09.234
You were dosed with a synthesized version
of the Scarecrow's fear gas...

51:09.401 --> 51:11.903
because will
is the source of your strength.

51:12.070 --> 51:15.490
And fear is the enemy of will.

51:15.657 --> 51:17.576
I've got the antidote to the fear gas.

51:17.742 --> 51:19.619
Don't need it.

51:28.336 --> 51:31.506
Robots, advanced drugs,
psychological profiling.

51:31.673 --> 51:34.009
No way Star Sapphire
came up with this on her own.

51:34.175 --> 51:35.594
I did this to you.

51:36.344 --> 51:38.305
To all of you.

51:41.766 --> 51:44.185
You want me to perform surgery
on him?

51:44.352 --> 51:45.645
You're the only one who can.

51:45.812 --> 51:47.522
Flash is at S.T.A.R. Labs Kyoto...

51:47.689 --> 51:49.983
waiting for them to finish
making a kryptonite scalpel.

51:50.150 --> 51:51.693
Nothing else can out his skin.

51:51.860 --> 51:53.153
But we've run out of time.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.031
Your shape shifting powers
are his best hope.

51:56.197 --> 51:57.324
This can work.

51:57.490 --> 51:59.576
I'm glad you think so.

52:00.035 --> 52:01.786
You're going to be doing
the cutting.

52:01.953 --> 52:04.122
Who with the what now?

52:05.081 --> 52:06.124
What's that?

52:06.291 --> 52:09.294
A piece of kryptonite
that you're going to use like a lens.

52:09.461 --> 52:13.048
Narrow your blaster to minimum
and filter it through.

52:13.548 --> 52:15.884
I really don't know if I can...

52:16.718 --> 52:18.386
Please.

52:20.305 --> 52:21.890
Tell me what to do.

52:26.561 --> 52:28.355
That's good.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.398
We're ready for you now.

52:40.992 --> 52:42.577
I have it

53:15.485 --> 53:16.736
MAN 1; All right!

53:16.903 --> 53:18.697
Yeah!

53:18.863 --> 53:20.573
What happened?

53:21.032 --> 53:23.243
Why don't you ask him?

53:30.083 --> 53:32.335
It was a coordinated attack
intended to kill us...

53:32.502 --> 53:35.797
or, failing that, put us out of
commission for an extended period.

53:35.964 --> 53:39.467
Obviously the first step of a larger
scheme, something that we would stop.

53:39.634 --> 53:41.803
The attacks were strategically brilliant.

53:41.970 --> 53:46.307
They were specifically targeted at our
physical and psychological weaknesses.

53:46.474 --> 53:49.602
Obviously by someone
who knows us very well.

53:49.769 --> 53:51.104
The plans were mine.

53:51.271 --> 53:53.148
- Yours?
- Say what, now?

53:53.314 --> 53:56.776
I've carefully studied
every Justice Leaguer, past and present...

53:56.943 --> 53:59.154
and created contingency plans
to neutralize you...

53:59.320 --> 54:02.240
- should that become necessary.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

54:02.407 --> 54:04.451
Neutralize, not kill.

54:04.617 --> 54:07.162
Whoever implemented my plans
altered them.

54:07.328 --> 54:10.290
It's still a completely unacceptable
breach of our trust.

54:10.457 --> 54:12.917
The Justice League
are among the most powerful...

54:13.084 --> 54:15.086
and potentially dangerous people
on the planet.

54:15.253 --> 54:17.589
You think one of us
would go over to the other side?

54:17.756 --> 54:20.842
Or succumb to mind control.
Yes, it's possible.

54:21.009 --> 54:24.012
That's why I developed plans
for containing any or all members...

54:24.179 --> 54:26.639
of the JLA should the need ever arise.

54:26.806 --> 54:28.808
None of us would ever do that to you.

54:28.975 --> 54:30.852
Then you're damned fools.

54:32.479 --> 54:34.272
Where do you think you're going?

54:36.733 --> 54:39.027
I'm just a visitor.
This is getting personal.

54:39.194 --> 54:41.321
Stay. You're part of this now.

54:44.657 --> 54:47.619
I'm not sure I have a problem
with Batman's contingency plans.

54:47.786 --> 54:50.330
But letting somebody steal them
was pretty damned dumb.

54:50.497 --> 54:53.958
I've had some time to think about that
and I know how it happened.

54:55.585 --> 54:58.004
Security video from the Batcave.

54:58.171 --> 55:00.465
He's in hologram form...

55:01.049 --> 55:04.385
so the motion detectors
didn't have anything to lock on to.

55:06.638 --> 55:10.183
Mirror Master's not that careful.
And the technology, the scope of all this?

55:10.350 --> 55:11.476
He's not working alone.

55:11.643 --> 55:14.312
The video's from the night
we caught the Royal Flush Gang.

55:14.479 --> 55:17.190
Whoever set them up
with that inter dimensional lock pick...

55:17.357 --> 55:21.069
also gave Mirror Master the means
to steal encrypted files.

55:21.236 --> 55:23.947
But the encryption
on your files is all but unbreakable.

55:24.113 --> 55:25.323
All but.

55:25.490 --> 55:26.533
I can find them.

55:26.699 --> 55:30.578
As you say, my encryption is formidable, but
in the event that it ever was cracked...

55:30.745 --> 55:32.705
You had a contingency plan.

55:32.872 --> 55:35.250
When my files are decrypted,
they call home.

55:38.503 --> 55:39.838
Louisiana.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.923
Swampland.

55:46.094 --> 55:49.722
So that thing's really going
to kill half the population of Earth.

55:49.889 --> 55:50.932
Not exactly.

55:51.099 --> 55:53.101
The solar flare
will do most of the damage.

55:53.268 --> 55:54.853
Solar flare?

55:55.019 --> 55:56.771
Think of this as a pilot light.

55:56.938 --> 55:59.858
When our ideal launch window opens
in just over an hour...

56:00.024 --> 56:02.652
this magnificent creation
will fly into the sun...

56:02.819 --> 56:04.571
trailing magnetic resonance.

56:04.737 --> 56:07.240
- And when it hits?
- It will trigger a solar flare...

56:07.407 --> 56:11.578
that will propagate at light speed
along the magnetic trail we've left.

56:11.744 --> 56:13.288
Eight and a half minutes later...

56:13.454 --> 56:16.541
it will utterly destroy
the sunward-facing side of the Earth.

56:16.708 --> 56:19.794
Nearly half the world's population
will die instantly.

56:19.961 --> 56:22.672
And thanks to the accompanying
electromagnetic pulse...

56:22.839 --> 56:26.634
any technology more advanced
than, say, the steam engine...

56:26.801 --> 56:28.469
will simply stop working.

56:28.636 --> 56:33.308
No technology, no superheroes,
no functioning governments.

56:33.474 --> 56:35.226
Except the one we control.

56:35.393 --> 56:37.437
That's quite an ambitious plan.

56:39.647 --> 56:41.482
No wonder you wanted us
out of the way.

56:41.649 --> 56:44.944
- I thought you took care of him.
- He should've been burning for weeks.

56:45.111 --> 56:46.279
Don't feel bad.

56:46.446 --> 56:49.073
Actually, none of you managed
to finish the job.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.159
Did you get all that?

56:52.118 --> 56:53.620
We did.

56:56.497 --> 56:58.499
Take them down.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.169
Don't let them get to the missile.

57:37.664 --> 57:38.706
Ha!

57:48.007 --> 57:50.468
I still can't believe
what you tried to do to me.

57:50.635 --> 57:51.886
You hurt me, Jordan.

57:52.053 --> 57:55.223
You broke my heart, and I'll never
stop trying to hurt you back.

58:11.406 --> 58:12.907
That's new.

58:21.082 --> 58:24.002
You didn't think it'd be that easy,
did you?

59:17.805 --> 59:19.724
Didn't I bury you alive?

59:19.891 --> 59:21.893
That's where you made your mistake.

59:22.060 --> 59:24.479
I won't repeat it.

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:17.532
You're good, but lately,
I've had a lot of practice fighting you.

01:00:44.392 --> 01:00:46.394
Where's the flipping
countdown command?

01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:55.570
<i>Missile launch aborted.</i>

01:01:37.904 --> 01:01:40.406
You never asked me
how my wrist was healing.

01:01:40.948 --> 01:01:43.951
Fine, how's your...? Unh!

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.787
Surprisingly fast.

01:01:57.256 --> 01:02:00.259
<i>Manual launch sequence engaged.</i>

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:35.711
Ah!

01:03:15.293 --> 01:03:18.879
Welcome to the dawn of a new world.

01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:36.647
I've got work to do.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:36.082
I do keep hurting you, don't I?

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:38.626
Savage launched the weapon.

01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:41.462
- Superman's already in pursuit.
- On it.

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:49.011
Superman, where are you?

01:04:49.178 --> 01:04:50.429
I'm approaching the missile.

01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:54.308
I should easily be able to intercept it
before it detonates.

01:05:23.712 --> 01:05:26.549
Superman?
- Can't talk now.

01:05:46.652 --> 01:05:48.195
No.

01:06:16.348 --> 01:06:17.808
The solar flare is coming.

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:19.101
How do we stop it?

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:23.230
I don't know, but we've got less than
eight minutes to figure something out.

01:06:25.566 --> 01:06:27.234
Maybe longer.

01:06:49.882 --> 01:06:51.842
- Not much blood.
- Not much back.

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:57.014
- You think he'll stop it'?
- He'll stop it.

01:06:57.181 --> 01:07:01.268
Not this time. Flare's on its way.
We've got seven minutes to come up with something.

01:07:01.435 --> 01:07:02.436
Seven minutes?

01:07:02.603 --> 01:07:05.606
Hal's gonna try to buy us more,
but that's all we can count on.

01:07:29.922 --> 01:07:31.966
Maybe I could move
the Earth out of the way?

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:34.385
If we had a week, I couldn't list
all the reasons that won't work.

01:07:34.552 --> 01:07:36.887
- You have a plan?
- No, but Savage does.

01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:40.474
This place is going to be sun side
by the time the flare gets here.

01:07:40.641 --> 01:07:42.184
The Legion wasn't worried either.

01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:45.563
There must be some mechanism
to protect them from the flare.

01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:49.441
Start talking.
I don't have time for niceties.

01:07:49.608 --> 01:07:52.278
You don't have time
to break an immortal either.

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:53.821
Don't have to.

01:07:53.988 --> 01:07:56.156
I know how they intended to survive.

01:07:56.323 --> 01:07:58.993
The intangibility tech
he gave the Royal Flush Gang.

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:00.578
It must've been a test run.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:03.414
Sure, just let the flare
pass right through this place.

01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:06.083
But where's the apparatus?
It would have to be huge.

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:09.587
That's the beauty part.
The Hall of Doom is the apparatus.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:13.090
I already downloaded the specs
when I interfaced with the control panel.

01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:17.344
Can this building generate a signal strong
enough to make the whole Earth intangible?

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:18.929
If we had enough power.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.098
Also, it would help if it were higher up.

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:23.017
- How high?
- Low orbit.

01:08:23.183 --> 01:08:24.810
I can help you out with that.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.861
Everybody knows their jobs. Go

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.055
Ah!

01:09:49.103 --> 01:09:50.479
J'onn?

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:53.232
It's Green Lantern.
His shield just failed.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.943
The solar flare is on its way.

01:09:57.444 --> 01:09:59.863
What about it?
Ls the displacement field ready?

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.616
- I think so, I'd like to test...
- This is the test.

01:11:33.749 --> 01:11:35.876
I'm calling this official meeting to order.

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:38.545
First, some news
for those of you who haven't heard.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:41.215
The world court
has just found Vandal Savage guilty...

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:42.883
of crimes against humanity.

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:44.551
Tell them what the immortal got.

01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:48.472
Life in prison,
without possibility of parole.

01:11:50.182 --> 01:11:52.726
A little new business.
I want to officially welcome...

01:11:52.893 --> 01:11:57.564
the newest member of the Justice League
by unanimous consent, Cyborg.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:58.982
Nice. Way to go.

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:00.901
- Good job.
- Congratulations, Victor.

01:12:01.276 --> 01:12:02.736
Thanks, everybody.

01:12:02.903 --> 01:12:05.280
And now, the main reason
I called this session.

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:09.535
In light of the breach of trust revealed
to us during the Vandal Savage matter...

01:12:09.701 --> 01:12:13.747
we have to decide whether Batman
should be allowed to remain in the league.

01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:16.375
- All those in favor of...
- Wait.

01:12:16.542 --> 01:12:19.920
Before we vote, the accused should be
allowed a few words in his defense.

01:12:20.087 --> 01:12:21.171
Seconded.

01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:23.590
Okay. Batman?

01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:25.926
My actions don't require any defense.

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:28.387
In the same situation, I'd do it again.

01:12:28.554 --> 01:12:29.680
Oh, come on.

01:12:29.847 --> 01:12:32.474
As individuals,
and even more so as a group...

01:12:32.641 --> 01:12:35.435
the Justice League is too dangerous
to lack a fail-safe...

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:37.604
against any possible misuse
of our power.

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:41.066
We use our power to protect the world.
We always have.

01:12:41.233 --> 01:12:44.486
And what if we ever used it
for some other purpose?

01:12:44.653 --> 01:12:48.949
If you people can't see the potential danger
of an out-of-control Justice League...

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:51.451
I don't need to wait for a vote.

01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:54.162
I don't belong here.

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:17.561
Got a minute?

01:13:20.772 --> 01:13:21.815
What do you want?

01:13:21.982 --> 01:13:24.860
You made contingency plans
to stop everybody in the League...

01:13:25.027 --> 01:13:26.987
just in case any of us ever went bad.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:30.407
My contingencies
were intended to immobilize, not kill.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:33.243
But Savage came up with the plan
to bury you.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.996
I assume so. It wasn't one of mine.

01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:38.165
Was that it?

01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:40.834
With all that talk
about unchecked power...

01:13:41.001 --> 01:13:45.005
you're still so arrogant you didn't bother
to come up with a plan to stop yourself?

01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:47.674
I do have a plan.

01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:49.843
It's called the Justice League.

01:13:51.345 --> 01:13:53.472
Just wanted to be sure.

01:13:56.642 --> 01:13:57.684
What is it?

01:13:57.851 --> 01:14:00.228
If the league ever did go over
to the wrong side...

01:14:00.395 --> 01:14:03.690
I want there to be somebody I can trust
to keep the planet safe.

01:14:04.358 --> 01:14:06.234
Even from me.
