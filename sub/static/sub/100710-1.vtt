WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.219
- Last season,
on "The Flash"...

00:02.263 --> 00:03.090
- Hey, Mom and Dad.

00:03.133 --> 00:04.482
If you're watching this,

00:04.526 --> 00:06.484
it means that
something went wrong.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.791
Mom, what's happening?
- A new timeline is setting in.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.662
- Thank you for everything.
- I love you.

00:13.665 --> 00:16.320
- Look, Kamilla, I don't want
to keep this from you anymore.

00:16.364 --> 00:19.236
- If being Vibe is a part
of the life you want,

00:19.280 --> 00:20.716
I would never
get in the way of that.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.065
- I wanna take the cure.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.285
- Killer Frost and I
are really gonna miss Vibe.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.200
- Me, too.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.289
- Dad...

00:28.332 --> 00:30.030
- I would like my replacement
to be you, Joe.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.336
- As captain?
- Captain Joe West.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.947
- None of you can stop
what's been set into motion

00:34.991 --> 00:36.427
because nothing you can do

00:36.471 --> 00:39.865
can alter
what's about to happen.

00:43.869 --> 00:46.698
- It's a system-wide
power surge.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.402
- It's coming
from the Time Vault.

00:56.969 --> 00:59.755
Are we under attack?
- I don't know.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.974
Whatever's going on
started the moment we left.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.152
- I wasn't perfect.

01:05.195 --> 01:08.590
Please remember
that I love you both...

01:08.633 --> 01:10.113
and I always will.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.462
And I always will.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.551
And I always will--
always--always--

01:23.039 --> 01:26.260
- Barry, Nora's message.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.919
- Why is it
every time I come to visit

01:33.963 --> 01:35.225
there's always a crisis?

01:35.269 --> 01:37.271
- Comes with
the meta-territory.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.882
750 mph.
He's getting faster.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.840
- Who is this guy, anyway?

01:41.884 --> 01:44.016
- An old family friend.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.458
His name's Godspeed,
and he's from the future.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.026
He's like a fake speedster.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.985
- What's that?

01:58.640 --> 02:00.772
- The real deal.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.312
- Kick his butt, Barry!

02:18.355 --> 02:20.444
- Done and doner.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.852
- Who are you and what
are you doing in Central City?

02:43.511 --> 02:46.209
- He's just like the others:
no language skills, just noise.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.516
- Lovely.
- What was that?

02:48.559 --> 02:50.779
- The fourth Godspeed
we've caught this summer

02:50.822 --> 02:52.998
and still no sign
of Mr. August Heart.

02:53.042 --> 02:55.000
Just another dummy
who can't communicate anything

02:55.044 --> 02:56.219
beyond modem speak.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.569
All right, I'm clocking out.

02:58.613 --> 03:01.355
Why don't you drop off G4
at Iron Heights, Barry?

03:01.398 --> 03:05.097
I don't think we're figuring
out this mystery today.

03:06.708 --> 03:07.839
- This is nice, Dad.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.276
We should do this
way more often.

03:09.319 --> 03:10.146
- Agreed.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.843
Hey, before I forget,

03:11.887 --> 03:14.019
congratulations
on "The Citizen."

03:14.063 --> 03:15.238
- Yeah, well, you know,

03:15.282 --> 03:16.718
there's millions of people
in Central City

03:16.761 --> 03:18.807
and I've only got a couple
hundred thousand subscribers.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.200
You know, I'm no CCPN.

03:20.243 --> 03:22.637
- Well, not yet,
but in about ten years

03:22.680 --> 03:24.900
it'll be a
Pulitzer Prize-winning empire.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.989
- Baby steps, Dad.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.209
- Mm, damn, this is good.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.341
- You know
you can't get drunk.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.951
- I don't even care,
that's how good this is.

03:32.995 --> 03:35.171
- Never fear, the party's here!

03:37.173 --> 03:38.870
- We brought
my famous ambrosia salad

03:38.914 --> 03:40.002
and veggie dogs for Ralph.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.438
- Guys, Ralph's still in Peru.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.875
- Or Monaco...or Texas?

03:43.919 --> 03:44.963
- All that
for a missing person's case?

03:45.007 --> 03:46.313
That's dedication.

03:46.356 --> 03:49.533
- Guys, guys,
what are we doing?

03:49.577 --> 03:52.449
Baby Jenna is napping
like a little angel

03:52.493 --> 03:54.625
and I have creamed corn,
I have candied yams,

03:54.669 --> 03:57.062
I have collard greens.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.977
Baby, let's eat.
- Yum!

03:59.021 --> 04:01.937
- Yeah!

04:10.772 --> 04:13.383
- How's the MAC coming?
- There's mac and cheese too?

04:14.993 --> 04:16.734
- No, the
Mental Augmentation Chamber.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.259
Basically, it allows us
to tap into the Speed Force

04:19.302 --> 04:20.869
to boost Barry's
cognitive abilities.

04:20.912 --> 04:23.654
It would allow him to see every
possible outcome to a scenario

04:23.698 --> 04:24.916
at the same time.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.091
- So speed-thinking.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.310
- Which means we'll be able

04:27.354 --> 04:28.746
to catch all
the bad guys faster.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.226
- With all the ones that
you brought in this summer,

04:30.270 --> 04:31.662
Barry, the DA's office
can barely keep up with you.

04:31.706 --> 04:32.750
- Hey, since the MAC's done,

04:32.794 --> 04:34.012
we should take it
for a test run.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.275
- Absolutely not.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.363
You know we're still
working out diagnostics.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.016
- We could put in
a few hours tonight,

04:38.060 --> 04:39.148
get a head start.

04:39.191 --> 04:40.584
- Barry...

04:40.628 --> 04:41.977
If there's anything
I've learned

04:42.020 --> 04:43.457
since leaving Vibe behind,

04:43.500 --> 04:46.198
it's that we all have
a work-life balance to protect,

04:46.242 --> 04:50.115
and right now, mine is tipping
towards more beer.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.686
Besides, I still gotta
tweak the mainframe

04:55.730 --> 04:59.124
and I can't do that without...

04:59.168 --> 05:00.474
- Uh--

05:00.517 --> 05:02.345
- Every time.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.304
- My tablet.
- Yeah.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.741
- Thank you.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.439
I'm gonna go get that beer.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.052
- Hey, so the last time
I talked to you guys,

05:14.096 --> 05:17.229
you seemed good.

05:17.273 --> 05:20.494
You guys good?

05:20.537 --> 05:22.365
- Um...

05:22.409 --> 05:23.975
we were devastated at first,

05:24.019 --> 05:26.021
but Nora's only gone
for right now.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.283
We're gonna have kids someday

05:27.327 --> 05:30.112
and then we'll have
another Nora.

05:30.155 --> 05:33.158
- Yeah, I think knowing
that we have a second chance

05:33.202 --> 05:34.856
makes all the difference.

05:36.379 --> 05:39.643
- I gotta go, a break-in
at Eastside Industrial.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.430
Dad, um, I meant to ask you,

05:43.473 --> 05:45.867
what did you do
with those boxes

05:45.910 --> 05:47.085
that were in the back
of the garage?

05:47.129 --> 05:50.567
- Oh, he finally
threw them away.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.264
Thank you very much.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.701
- Okay, I gotta make a call.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.445
- Guys, I'm sorry, I actually
have to sneak out too.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.143
A friend of mine from
med school needs my support.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.711
Thanks for having me,
it was delicious.

06:03.754 --> 06:06.627
- Bye, Caitlin.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.193
You notice ain't nobody
help clean up?

06:10.500 --> 06:14.374
- My name is Ramsey Rosso,

06:14.417 --> 06:17.377
and my mother,
Dr. Rachel Rosso,

06:17.420 --> 06:19.596
was everything to me.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.903
When I was seven,

06:21.946 --> 06:24.079
I skidded out pretty badly
on a bike she bought me

06:24.122 --> 06:26.603
for my birthday.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.779
Imagine a scared kid
with two scraped knees

06:28.823 --> 06:30.520
and a bloody nose.

06:30.564 --> 06:34.219
When Mum found me,
she picked me right up,

06:34.263 --> 06:36.396
she brushed me off,

06:36.439 --> 06:40.008
and told me to get back
on my bike and ride.

06:41.662 --> 06:45.013
I tried, but I couldn't.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.928
It was almost like
I was paralyzed,

06:46.971 --> 06:49.191
it hurt so bad.

06:49.234 --> 06:52.803
That's when she told me
that I would heal.

06:52.847 --> 06:55.893
That I must never
let a little pain stop me

06:55.937 --> 06:58.722
from getting to where I needed
to go in life,

06:58.766 --> 07:01.856
and she was right.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.249
I did heal.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.776
Enough to grow up

07:08.819 --> 07:10.952
and follow in her footsteps.

07:13.476 --> 07:17.567
And even though a beautiful
life was cut short

07:17.611 --> 07:20.614
when she lost her battle
to heal herself...

07:22.659 --> 07:25.923
She is still helping me to get
to where I need to go today.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.630
And for that,
I will always be grateful.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.983
Thank you, Jonathan.

07:42.026 --> 07:44.333
- Ramsey, hi.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.206
I'm so sorry for your loss.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.947
Your mother was
an incredible woman.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.383
I'm gonna miss her.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.473
- It means so much
that you came.

07:53.516 --> 07:56.563
Mum actually saw something
of herself in you.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.739
Probably because
you're both overachievers.

08:00.349 --> 08:02.786
- Your hands are so cold.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.703
- Are you all right?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.011
- Yeah, sorry, I'm fine.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.796
Um, probably just
coming down with something.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.232
- Well, I hope not.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.539
Doctors make rubbish patients.
- Mm.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.323
It was nice to see you.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.675
- Eh, Caitlin?

08:21.718 --> 08:24.982
Things have been
a bit, um, crazy.

08:27.245 --> 08:30.205
Do you fancy coming around
for a cuppa sometime?

08:30.248 --> 08:33.425
You know, for a proper
catch-up.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.079
I could really use someone
to talk to right now.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.733
- Of course, any time.

08:36.777 --> 08:39.649
Just give me a call.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.009
- Well, my log says that
your father's stuff

08:52.053 --> 08:54.882
should have ended up
somewhere around here.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.978
There it is.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.338
- Must be pretty important.

09:16.381 --> 09:20.168
Yeah, it is.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.126
Thanks.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.224
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.487
- H-hang on!

09:35.531 --> 09:38.055
I've got you!

09:52.809 --> 09:55.203
You okay?

10:02.253 --> 10:05.300
What the hell?

10:11.132 --> 10:13.264
- I missed you last night.
Are you sure you're okay?

10:13.308 --> 10:14.483
- Yeah.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.834
- What were you doing
out here anyway?

10:17.878 --> 10:20.663
- I was following up
on a lead.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.839
"The Citizen" got a tip

10:22.883 --> 10:25.755
that there were a series
of junkyard robberies.

10:25.799 --> 10:30.107
- People file police reports
for stolen trash?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.501
- Yeah, well, you know,

10:32.544 --> 10:34.285
not everything that's here
is garbage.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.075
- Everything here is garbage!

10:41.118 --> 10:42.642
I hate garbage.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.469
- Okay, have fun
with Ghostbusters.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.254
I'll see you at home.
- Mm-hmm.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.737
- What do you got?

10:50.780 --> 10:53.478
- This site is littered--
no pun intended--

10:53.522 --> 10:56.525
with gamma rays
and magnetar fields.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.179
- What are you saying?
Iris was attacked by a--

10:58.222 --> 11:01.661
- Yeah, a frakkin' black hole.

11:07.579 --> 11:11.322
That is a whole lot
of information to disseminate.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.063
- No one's ever extrapolated
this much data

11:13.107 --> 11:14.151
from a black hole before.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.719
- We can be the first.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.329
Come on, we're Team Flash!

11:18.373 --> 11:20.157
- What did you put
in his coffee?

11:20.201 --> 11:21.506
- Okay, a black hole
just showed up

11:21.550 --> 11:23.160
and nearly swallowed Iris.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.815
- So let's crunch the numbers,
find out where it went.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.165
- I'm sorry, are we looking
at the same screen?

11:28.209 --> 11:31.081
Creating a search algorithm
for this is gonna be like

11:31.125 --> 11:34.041
deciphering a mystery
wrapped up in an enigma.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.085
- Then it's a good thing

11:35.129 --> 11:38.219
that "mystery"
is my middle name.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.832
The name's Dibny...

11:42.876 --> 11:45.487
Ralph Dibny.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.184
- Welcome back, Ralph.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.839
- It's good to see you, man.
- Nice threads.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.102
Where'd you get them?
- Picked this up in the Opal.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.713
- A missing person's case

11:53.756 --> 11:54.975
sent you all the way
to Opal City?

11:55.018 --> 11:56.411
- And beyond, my friend.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.239
A summer spent undercover
rubbing Rolexes

11:58.282 --> 11:59.849
with the wealthy elite.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.982
Did you guys know
it's pronounced "yacht"

12:02.025 --> 12:03.548
and not "yah-kt"?

12:03.592 --> 12:05.159
- Yep.
- God, I missed you.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.030
- Anyway, just following
any leads that might help

12:07.074 --> 12:09.859
explain the disappearance
of Sue Dearbon.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.775
- I don't think I've ever seen
you this devoted to a case.

12:12.819 --> 12:16.083
- Me neither, but this one
is a real tragedy.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.780
Maybe it was the look
of desperation

12:17.824 --> 12:19.390
in her parents' eyes
when they begged me

12:19.434 --> 12:20.783
to find their daughter.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.829
So, uh, what's new
in Central City?

12:22.872 --> 12:26.049
- We are trying
to track a black hole.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.790
- Of course you are.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.271
- We were just about to start
decoding this data stream.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.057
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:34.101 --> 12:36.059
- Ugh, I'm sorry, sorry.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.496
Been having these
random frost-outs lately.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.716
- For how long?
- All summer.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.457
It's happened twice
in the last couple of days.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.546
- Cait, you're probably
overworked.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.895
Maybe take a time out?

12:45.939 --> 12:47.723
- A friend of mine did want
to meet for coffee.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.986
- Ramsey?
- Yeah.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.596
- It's never easy
losing a parent.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.729
Maybe you should
take him up on it.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.079
- I'll give him a call.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.780
- Ah, found it.

13:00.823 --> 13:04.566
Theft report for Leawood
and New Brighton junkyard.

13:04.609 --> 13:05.610
See, I have a system.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.003
- You're a hoarder,
but I love you.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.005
- Iris.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.010
Huh, these don't seem

13:14.054 --> 13:15.838
to have anything to do
with the black hole.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.754
They're just
run-of-the-mill human thefts.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.975
Well, you have a list
of persons of interest,

13:22.018 --> 13:23.150
in any case.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.281
- Yeah, thank you.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.501
Um, I'll get right on this.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.938
- Iris?

13:28.982 --> 13:31.375
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.030
I--I don't know, maybe I'm
still a little shaken up

13:34.074 --> 13:35.466
from the black hole.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.295
I'll be fine, thank you.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.737
- You remembered
how I like my lattes.

13:45.781 --> 13:48.044
- With a bit of cinnamon,
just like Mum.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.090
You know, of all her
CC Hospital residents,

13:50.133 --> 13:52.092
she really took
a special liking to you.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.354
- She was the first person

13:53.397 --> 13:55.443
to realize that
I was into cutting-edge tech.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.880
It was her letter
of recommendation

13:57.924 --> 14:00.491
that started my career
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.583
- I couldn't save her, Cait.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.586
Had to watch
as her body betrayed her.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.155
Do you know how HLH works?

14:12.199 --> 14:14.723
Then you know the cancer
literally boils you

14:14.766 --> 14:16.725
from the inside out.

14:18.422 --> 14:22.383
Can you imagine
what that must have felt like?

14:22.426 --> 14:25.038
Watching her suffer...

14:27.431 --> 14:29.042
That's my last memory of her.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.434
- Don't let it be.

14:30.478 --> 14:34.090
What you said at the funeral
about how brave she was?

14:34.134 --> 14:35.700
Remember that.

14:35.744 --> 14:38.312
- I lied.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.358
Truth is, she was a coward.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.969
- What do you mean?

14:43.012 --> 14:46.363
- As a doctor, she knew her
chances of surviving were slim,

14:46.407 --> 14:50.280
so she just started ticking
things off her bucket list.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.629
- Isn't that a good thing?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.544
- She should have
gone down fighting.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.938
Instead, she ran away.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.114
I didn't.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.470
In HLH,
white blood cells attack

15:06.514 --> 15:07.776
the body's immune system.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.778
A median survival rate
after diagnosis

15:09.821 --> 15:13.260
was two to six months.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.131
Not anymore.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.702
- Oh, my God,
this is a potential cure.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.660
But what's the bonding agent

15:22.704 --> 15:25.228
strengthening
the body's defenses?

15:25.272 --> 15:27.013
- Dark matter.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.318
I know what
you're thinking, Cait.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.364
I thought the same thing, too--
at first.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.061
But I have been running
simulations for months,

15:32.105 --> 15:33.758
and they all show
the same results.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.151
My cure will work.

15:35.195 --> 15:38.589
- Or turn them into meta-humans
against their will.

15:38.633 --> 15:39.982
- But I can save lives.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.766
I just need the dark matter
to start human trials.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.770
- And that's why you wanted
to get coffee with me.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.947
- S.T.A.R. Labs
has the dark matter I need

15:47.990 --> 15:49.949
to take the next step;
you have access to it.

15:49.992 --> 15:53.343
- Ramsey, your research,
it's groundbreaking,

15:53.387 --> 15:55.476
but using dark matter?

15:55.519 --> 15:56.999
That's a deal-breaker.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.479
- It wasn't when you made
the meta-human cure.

15:58.522 --> 16:01.090
- That was different.
We were trying to protect them.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.875
- Well, what about
the rest of us?

16:07.401 --> 16:10.143
- I'm sorry.
I really am.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.885
But my answer is still no.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.984
- She didn't have to die, Cait.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.551
No one with HLH does,

16:27.595 --> 16:30.467
because you could help me
stop it.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.526
Frost, where are you?

17:57.467 --> 18:00.122
- How you feeling?
- Like I should be dead.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.168
- That's not gonna happen.
We're Team Flash.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.908
We always watch
each other's backs.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.127
We always
keep each other safe.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.825
- Meanwhile, over here
in the real world,

18:07.869 --> 18:09.610
our black hole
keeps growing up.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.961
Only next time it pops up,
it won't just be Jitters.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.484
The whole city
could be in danger.

18:14.528 --> 18:16.530
- Why did this thing show up
outside Jitters, anyway?

18:16.573 --> 18:19.010
What does a coffee shop have
in common with a junkyard?

18:19.054 --> 18:21.883
- I think I know
who can tell us.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.974
Okay, so I followed up
with CCPD's list

18:26.017 --> 18:27.149
of junkyard robberies.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.020
Ten of them
were persons of interest,

18:29.064 --> 18:31.284
nine were career criminals,
but this one guy,

18:31.327 --> 18:33.851
a scientist, was let go
with a warning

18:33.895 --> 18:36.985
after being caught
stealing old lab equipment.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.988
Team Flash,
meet Chester P. Runk.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.991
- Hey, what up, party people?

18:43.034 --> 18:44.775
Welcome to a world
where all are welcome

18:44.819 --> 18:48.953
and anything, including
the scientifically impossible,

18:48.997 --> 18:52.000
can and probably will happen.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.393
I'm your boy

18:53.436 --> 18:55.264
Chugga-Chugga-Chugga-Chugga
Chester...

18:55.308 --> 18:57.614
- I really like him.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.922
- With knowledge from
the bleeding edge of physics

19:00.965 --> 19:04.055
and beyond-beyond-beyond.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.622
I've been working
on that echo.

19:05.666 --> 19:09.191
And--and yes, as usual,
I am fueled by some...

19:09.235 --> 19:11.411
mm, damn fine coffee

19:11.454 --> 19:13.630
from everyone's
favorite beanery.

19:13.674 --> 19:16.677
Poured, of course,
to, uh, perfection

19:16.720 --> 19:18.722
by a certain special someone.

19:18.766 --> 19:22.291
Huh, huh, huh?

19:22.335 --> 19:25.990
Uh, no, WookieLover77, I...

19:26.034 --> 19:28.863
I have not asked her out yet,

19:28.906 --> 19:30.604
but I got my punch card, okay?

19:30.647 --> 19:33.824
Three more Vibe-achinos
and I'm making my move, baby.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.739
I'm making my move, baby.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.176
I'm making my move, baby!

19:37.219 --> 19:39.830
- Okay, he talks about Natalie
for a while, so...

19:39.874 --> 19:41.832
There we go.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.664
- Is he building
what I think he's building?

19:47.708 --> 19:50.189
- Behold, believers:

19:50.232 --> 19:51.755
a gravitational wave emitter

19:51.799 --> 19:53.540
powered by a modulated
neutrino charger.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.019
In other words,

19:55.063 --> 19:57.674
"Time to call some aliens."

19:57.718 --> 20:01.025
- He built this in his garage?
- Using nothing but trash.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.593
What a legend.
Oh, he's turning it on.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.509
- Uh--uh, no.

20:06.553 --> 20:09.425
No, no, no, that's not
supposed to do that.

20:09.469 --> 20:12.385
Oh, crap.
Uh, hold on.

20:18.565 --> 20:21.045
- Okay, not exactly getting
the supervillain vibe

20:21.089 --> 20:22.308
from our boy Chester here.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.353
- He opened a black hole
by accident.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.225
- And what about Chester?
Is he okay?

20:26.268 --> 20:28.270
- Well, police reports show
that EMTs took him to the ER,

20:28.314 --> 20:30.054
but then after that
the trail goes cold.

20:30.098 --> 20:31.795
- Just a tiny question here:

20:31.839 --> 20:35.495
how do we destroy a black hole?

20:44.330 --> 20:47.158
- Well, I am not a doctor,

20:47.202 --> 20:48.334
but I'm gonna assume
in this case

20:48.377 --> 20:50.423
that "negative"
means a positive.

20:50.466 --> 20:51.859
- Not if it means
being clueless

20:51.902 --> 20:53.252
about why my powers won't work.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.211
- Did anything out of the
ordinary happen recently?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.996
- I went to my friend Ramsey's
mom's funeral yesterday.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.302
- Anything unusual
about the service?

21:00.346 --> 21:02.304
- No, it was a lovely service

21:02.348 --> 21:05.307
for an inspiring woman.

21:05.351 --> 21:08.223
Then, today, I nearly got
sucked into oblivion.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.225
- Has our frosty femme fatale

21:10.269 --> 21:13.315
ever refused to come out
like this before?

21:13.359 --> 21:16.927
- The last time I can think of
is right after my dad died.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.277
- Right.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.582
- So you think funeral

21:19.626 --> 21:21.497
plus nearly getting sucked
into a black hole

21:21.541 --> 21:24.500
equals Killer Frost is afraid
of dying?

21:24.544 --> 21:26.459
- Maybe...

21:26.502 --> 21:29.026
but I know we're gonna
figure this out.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.517
- This place creeps me out.

21:43.171 --> 21:45.521
- Will this sort you out?

21:47.262 --> 21:50.309
- Nice doing business with you.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.097
Whoever pissed you off

21:56.140 --> 22:00.188
won't be a problem anymore.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.805
- Chester P. Runk is here?

22:10.677 --> 22:13.157
- Ward nurses say he's been
catatonic since he arrived.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.986
Just involuntary muscle spasms.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.604
- Chester?

22:29.739 --> 22:32.873
My name is Iris West-Allen,
I'm a reporter.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.966
Chester, can you hear me?

22:45.276 --> 22:47.757
He was our only lead.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.847
- Iris.

22:52.501 --> 22:56.418
You lost something of Nora's
last night, didn't you?

22:56.462 --> 22:59.203
Something that Joe
accidentally threw away,

22:59.247 --> 23:02.511
it ended up at that junkyard.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.608
I just miss her so much.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.613
Every day, every minute.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.747
And I know
that is selfish because...

23:20.790 --> 23:23.576
one day I may get
to see Nora again.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.493
But it won't be our Nora,
you know?

23:27.536 --> 23:30.757
The one that we knew, the one
that we have pictures of,

23:30.800 --> 23:32.846
the one that we grew to love,
you know...

23:35.849 --> 23:38.068
That Nora is gone forever.

23:41.071 --> 23:45.075
And I guess because of that
you know, I just...

23:45.119 --> 23:46.816
I don't know
how I'm supposed to feel.

23:46.860 --> 23:50.341
- Iris, you do not get
to cheat the grieving process

23:50.385 --> 23:53.693
just because you know you're
gonna see Nora again someday.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.524
- Yeah, you're right.

23:58.567 --> 23:59.873
I guess I just
haven't been able

23:59.916 --> 24:02.919
to put into words
how I've been feeling.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.059
- Iris?

24:14.322 --> 24:17.064
What is it?

24:25.594 --> 24:27.683
- It's Chester.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.954
Oh, my God.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.697
- You're looking at
the world's first

24:41.741 --> 24:45.484
inverse mass
angular momentum disruptor,

24:45.527 --> 24:49.183
but we can just call it
a stellar grenade.

24:49.226 --> 24:50.619
- Cool.

24:50.663 --> 24:53.187
So this will
destroy the black hole?

24:53.230 --> 24:55.798
- As long as it doesn't
get much bigger,

24:55.842 --> 24:59.062
this will reverse the hole's
mass-collecting properties,

24:59.106 --> 25:00.542
causing it to...

25:00.586 --> 25:01.587
Implode.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.676
Just toss it
in the event horizon;

25:03.719 --> 25:07.027
hastalasagna,
don't get any on you.

25:07.070 --> 25:10.378
- We can't.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.989
If we destroy it,
we're gonna kill Chester too.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.826
- You sure about this?

25:23.870 --> 25:25.915
- Yeah, the corona's flair
matched the exact cadence

25:25.959 --> 25:27.264
of Chester's fingers.

25:27.308 --> 25:30.529
- So the black hole and Chester
are connected?

25:30.572 --> 25:33.444
- Actually, I think
Chester is the black hole.

25:33.488 --> 25:36.926
Watch this: so normally,
stimuli enters the brain

25:36.970 --> 25:39.059
through the sensory area,
goes up to the temporal lobe,

25:39.102 --> 25:40.539
and then back around,

25:40.582 --> 25:43.585
but watch what happens
in Chester's brain.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.108
It starts in the right area,

25:45.152 --> 25:47.415
but halfway through
its rotation, it disappears.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.853
- I think I know
where it's going.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.510
You're looking at a map
of the negative ionic energy

25:55.554 --> 25:56.903
inside the black hole.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.295
Watch what happens

25:58.339 --> 25:59.906
when an energy pulse travels
along its tendrils.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.343
See how it stops halfway?

26:04.127 --> 26:08.001
- The black hole is the other
half of Chester's mind.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.611
It's his consciousness.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.134
- Maybe it's been showing up

26:11.178 --> 26:14.703
in places that hold an
emotional attachment for him,

26:14.747 --> 26:17.010
like the junkyard where he
stole stuff for his projects.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.707
- He's got a crush
on a girl at Jitters.

26:18.751 --> 26:22.015
Okay, so all we have to do
is get Chester's mind

26:22.058 --> 26:23.886
out of the black hole,
reunite it with his body,

26:23.930 --> 26:26.236
and once his
condition stabilizes,

26:26.280 --> 26:28.282
the black hole
should just collapse.

26:28.325 --> 26:31.720
- Right, but they don't exactly
teach that in med school.

26:31.764 --> 26:33.417
- Okay, but we can't
just let Chester die.

26:33.461 --> 26:36.246
We have to do something.

26:39.293 --> 26:41.295
- Look, I don't like saying it,

26:41.338 --> 26:45.691
but I think we need
to consider it.

26:45.734 --> 26:46.953
- Cisco, I know
where you're going.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.694
- And you know
we already have a way

26:48.737 --> 26:50.391
of beating this
before it gets any bigger.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.523
- We're not discussing this.
- You think I like saying this?

26:52.567 --> 26:55.091
I don't, but if we don't find
a solution for this

26:55.135 --> 26:57.006
and find one now, we're gonna
have to make a choice

26:57.050 --> 26:58.617
down the line, and it's either
gonna be Chester

26:58.660 --> 26:59.748
or it's gonna be everyone
in Central City.

26:59.792 --> 27:02.925
- I'm not losing anyone else!

27:04.318 --> 27:06.407
I'm--let's find another way.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.946
- Where's the meltdown?

27:23.990 --> 27:26.427
- We gotta talk.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.648
- What is your problem?

27:31.171 --> 27:32.912
- My problem is, we needed you,

27:32.955 --> 27:35.915
and you were holed up
in your Snow-tress of Solitude.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.699
I mean, you even refused
to come out at Jitters.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.484
- Flash was there, so spare me
the little hallway chat--

27:40.528 --> 27:44.488
and I'm not afraid of dying.

27:44.532 --> 27:47.535
- I know that,
but you are afraid of living.

27:47.578 --> 27:50.756
Thomas' death, the funeral,
what happened at Jitters:

27:50.799 --> 27:52.758
all those things happened
to Caitlin.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.498
She also led
her high school debate team

27:54.542 --> 27:55.761
to back-to-back championships.

27:55.804 --> 27:59.025
She went to med school.
She married Ronnie.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.114
Those are her memories.
- Yes, I know.

28:01.157 --> 28:03.507
I was there.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.161
What's your point?

28:05.205 --> 28:06.641
- Having Caitlin's memories

28:06.685 --> 28:08.948
isn't the same
as having your own.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.689
- Like you'd know anything
about that.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.081
- I know it sucked
sitting courtside

28:12.125 --> 28:14.170
for the Thinker show
when he hijacked my body,

28:14.214 --> 28:17.086
and I think that you've been
going through something similar

28:17.130 --> 28:19.523
since Thomas died.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.003
And after being
at that funeral,

28:21.047 --> 28:23.832
seeing that woman live
the last days of her life

28:23.876 --> 28:26.574
to the fullest,
I think that made you want

28:26.617 --> 28:28.228
want to start living
your best life right now.

28:28.271 --> 28:32.058
- That's not my gig, okay?

28:32.101 --> 28:35.626
I fight the bad guys,
keep Caiti safe,

28:35.670 --> 28:37.716
and then go back in my cage.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.850
I just have to deal with it.

28:41.894 --> 28:45.201
- Have you thought
to ask Caitlin how she feels?

28:45.245 --> 28:47.334
- What's she gonna say?

28:47.377 --> 28:49.118
"Go ahead, Frost,
take the wheel."

28:49.162 --> 28:52.339
-  There's only
one way to find out.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.788
- You know, Barry, I think
it's time we faced the truth.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.399
- I can't give up on Chester.

29:09.443 --> 29:11.532
- No, I meant...

29:11.575 --> 29:14.187
About Nora.

29:14.230 --> 29:16.842
Look, I know we keep saying
that we're fine,

29:16.885 --> 29:20.889
but I still miss the Nora
that was, Barry,

29:20.933 --> 29:23.674
not the Nora that will be,
and I think that you do too.

29:25.851 --> 29:29.419
I think that's why you've been
working so hard all summer.

29:33.423 --> 29:35.034
- I thought if I could
keep people safe,

29:35.077 --> 29:37.906
that it would make up
for how much I miss her.

29:39.821 --> 29:43.346
Think all the work this summer
and the long hours,

29:43.390 --> 29:46.088
pushing myself,
pushing the team...

29:47.611 --> 29:50.440
It's so I could avoid
what scares me the most...

29:52.225 --> 29:55.706
That I'll never get over this.

29:55.750 --> 29:58.666
- There is no support group
for what we're experiencing.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.979
You know why
I was at that junkyard?

30:10.504 --> 30:13.115
I lost my purple jacket.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.815
And I was obsessed

30:16.858 --> 30:20.731
with getting it back because...

30:23.517 --> 30:26.215
You know, in my mind...

30:28.261 --> 30:30.045
Nora needs it.

30:30.089 --> 30:33.483
You know, she needs it
to become XS.

30:35.877 --> 30:40.577
And when that thing
swallowed it, just--

30:40.621 --> 30:42.449
just for, like, a tiny second,

30:42.492 --> 30:45.321
I wanted it to swallow me too.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.680
You know, the only way
we're gonna get through this

30:56.724 --> 31:00.684
is if we carry
this burden together.

31:00.728 --> 31:03.339
It's the only way, Barry.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.524
- We just ran out of time.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.582
- Okay, so how do we get
Chester's consciousness

31:28.625 --> 31:30.192
out of the black hole?

31:30.236 --> 31:32.934
- Well, the electrical impulses
that make up Chester's mind

31:32.978 --> 31:35.197
are just past
the black hole's threshold,

31:35.241 --> 31:38.026
but since his synaptic energy
has a negative charge--

31:38.070 --> 31:39.549
- I could use my lightning's
positive charge

31:39.593 --> 31:40.637
to attract his energy.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.030
- Like a magnet.
- Exactly.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.423
- Then what?

31:43.466 --> 31:44.641
I mean, how are you gonna
survive inside of there?

31:44.685 --> 31:45.729
- Well, your--
your Speed Force aura

31:45.773 --> 31:47.862
should protect you, right?

31:47.906 --> 31:48.994
- What if it doesn't?

31:49.037 --> 31:50.734
- The gravimetric forces
will crush you

31:50.778 --> 31:52.301
to a subatomic size
within seconds.

31:52.345 --> 31:53.607
- That's not gonna happen.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.825
The Speed Force
is a billion times stronger

31:54.869 --> 31:56.349
than any gravimetric force.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.917
- Even if you do survive
the entry, we don't have a way

31:58.960 --> 32:01.745
of keeping Chester's mind
intact on the way out.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.747
We'd need
superconductive wiring

32:03.791 --> 32:05.314
from a quantum computer
to do that,

32:05.358 --> 32:08.143
and last time I checked,
those only exist in the future.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.799
- Nora.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.062
Our Nora,
she can still help us.

32:14.106 --> 32:16.325
- Oh, my God,
her back-up gauntlet.

32:16.369 --> 32:17.848
Cisco, it's still here.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.807
- That gauntlet's gonna have
the filament we need.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.113
I'll strip it out
and thread it into your suit.

32:21.156 --> 32:22.941
- Okay, in the meantime, Ralph,

32:22.984 --> 32:24.551
can you and Frost help CCPD
evacuate downtown?

32:24.594 --> 32:28.772
- Frost is ready to come out
and to use Cisco's present.

32:38.782 --> 32:39.740
- Captain, you shouldn't be
out here!

32:39.783 --> 32:40.784
- It's my city too.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.177
Help these people
get out of here.

32:42.221 --> 32:43.831
- Yes, sir!

32:55.364 --> 32:57.845
- No!

33:06.114 --> 33:07.637
- Run, dude.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.605
- You're welcome.
- Suit's finished.

33:18.648 --> 33:22.000
- Okay, great, so when Barry
gets Chester's consciousness

33:22.043 --> 33:23.784
out of there,
what is he supposed to do

33:23.827 --> 33:25.307
with that energy?

33:25.351 --> 33:27.614
- You remember the MAC?
- Yeah, but it's not working.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.137
- No, but the
structural integrity

33:29.181 --> 33:31.922
is strong enough
to contain synaptic energy.

33:31.966 --> 33:34.882
Besides, we already moved
Chester into it, so...

33:34.925 --> 33:37.624
- I'm sorry, what?
"We" moved Chester?

33:37.667 --> 33:39.147
- That's right.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.367
I may be small,
but I can bench my body weight.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.506

35:57.024 --> 35:59.461
Hey--hey, you're the Flash.

36:01.115 --> 36:02.769
- With the speeding around
and the lightning and all that.

36:02.812 --> 36:05.293
Hey, big fan, man, big fan.

36:05.337 --> 36:08.209
Also, where am I?

36:16.913 --> 36:19.655
Chester is doing
so much better.

36:19.699 --> 36:22.180
I mean, don't get me wrong,
he's still, you know, glowing

36:22.223 --> 36:23.833
in the eyes
with orange dark energy,

36:23.877 --> 36:25.618
but he's in
really good spirits.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.097
- How long until he gets out?

36:27.141 --> 36:29.448
- Caitlin said his molecules
need to destabilize

36:29.491 --> 36:30.840
at the subatomic level.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.494
My guess is he'll need
to cook in the MAC

36:32.538 --> 36:35.018
for another four
to six weeks, maybe more,

36:35.062 --> 36:36.498
until he's back to normal.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.761
- Well, believe me, he is
more than happy to chill here

36:38.805 --> 36:40.502
at S.T.A.R. Labs
in the meantime.

36:40.546 --> 36:42.200
And when he does get out,
that boy knows

36:42.243 --> 36:43.940
exactly what he wants to do.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.204
- Mm, definitely gonna
ask Natalie out.

36:46.247 --> 36:47.422
- Speaking of going out,

36:47.466 --> 36:49.685
Kamilla and I
are doing shawarma Tuesday,

36:49.729 --> 36:51.644
so I'm gonna mosey.

36:51.687 --> 36:55.430
Of course, moseying is a lot
harder these days post-Vibe.

36:55.474 --> 36:58.041
Showing up to a date
in a S.T.A.R. Lab van,

36:58.085 --> 36:59.260
not a good look.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.262
- Mm, no.
I'll give you a ride.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.482
- And risk looking like
my mom just dropped me off?

37:03.525 --> 37:07.225
- Ooh, even better,
you can walk.

37:07.268 --> 37:09.139
- Okay, I'm coming.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.360
- It never occurred to me

37:12.404 --> 37:15.320
that you might want
to live a life.

37:15.363 --> 37:17.365
That's why I never offered
to let you drive,

37:17.409 --> 37:19.541
not because I think
you're only good in a fight.

37:19.585 --> 37:20.586
- You sure?

37:20.629 --> 37:22.283
I know it's a really big ask,

37:22.327 --> 37:24.503
and I don't want you
feeling obligated or whatever.

37:24.546 --> 37:27.549
- Frost, you have always
been there for me,

37:27.593 --> 37:29.986
protecting me.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.902
Now I get to do something
for you.

37:32.946 --> 37:35.688
Besides, even though
it's always felt

37:35.731 --> 37:37.385
like you were a part of me,

37:37.429 --> 37:40.606
for the first time, it feels
like I'm a part of you.

37:40.649 --> 37:42.738
- Thank you.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.914
- Any time.

37:53.488 --> 37:56.012
- Guess everything's
coming up frosty, huh?

37:56.056 --> 37:58.450
- Yeah, I guess.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.148
Where do I start?

38:01.191 --> 38:04.151
How do you, you know,
live a life?

38:04.194 --> 38:07.110
- With a life coach,
of course.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.290
So, first thing's first:
the name "Killer,"

38:12.333 --> 38:13.465
it's a little bit too much
for some folks.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.118
Have you thought about
changing it?

38:15.162 --> 38:17.643
My mom's middle name is Anne.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.636
I will never accept death,

38:54.680 --> 38:56.812
not like you did.

39:26.189 --> 39:28.844
- So, what made you believe

39:28.888 --> 39:31.020
that you could carry Chester
out of that place?

39:31.064 --> 39:34.284
- You made me believe
I could do it.

39:34.328 --> 39:39.115
I realized we could be
each other's support group,

39:39.159 --> 39:41.509
even though it's gonna
take some time.

39:41.553 --> 39:43.685
If we can carry a memory
like this together

39:43.729 --> 39:46.253
in our hearts, carrying
somebody's consciousness

39:46.296 --> 39:48.429
out of a black hole?

39:48.473 --> 39:50.475
It's a piece of cake.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.217
- Besides, how else
could I get this back for you?

40:04.750 --> 40:08.275
I know it's not as good
as Nora's video...

40:14.760 --> 40:16.544
It's better.

40:16.588 --> 40:19.373
Now we have something
that we can honor Nora with.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.462
- She was pretty "schway."

40:34.344 --> 40:36.259
What do you want?

40:36.303 --> 40:39.219
- For your universe to survive.

40:39.262 --> 40:41.656
- The plinth...

40:41.700 --> 40:42.788
you destroyed it.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.006
You destroyed Nora's message.

40:44.050 --> 40:47.488
- An unfortunate side effect.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.925
But I needed to discourage you.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.274
- From doing what?

40:51.318 --> 40:53.146
- Hoping.

40:53.189 --> 40:55.583
Your determination
is boundless, Flash--

40:55.627 --> 40:58.064
it is one
of your greatest qualities--

40:58.107 --> 41:00.327
but you cannot avoid
the coming Crisis.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.547
- Barry has five years
before he vanishes.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.287
- No longer.

41:04.331 --> 41:08.117
December 10, 2019.

41:08.161 --> 41:11.730
On that day,
he will answer the call

41:11.773 --> 41:14.210
and make
the ultimate sacrifice.

41:14.254 --> 41:16.474
Soon...

41:16.517 --> 41:18.301
this world will fight
for the fate

41:18.345 --> 41:20.042
of all the known universes.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.480
- I'm not gonna leave
my family.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.394
There has to be a way
to stop what's coming.

41:24.438 --> 41:26.788
- I am sorry,

41:26.832 --> 41:28.573
but events have been set
into motion

41:28.616 --> 41:30.531
that you cannot
possibly comprehend.

41:30.575 --> 41:33.142
- I don't need
to understand them!

41:33.186 --> 41:34.230
Just tell me what I can do.

41:34.274 --> 41:37.320
- To survive?

41:37.364 --> 41:39.322
You can't.

41:39.366 --> 41:41.368
In order
for billions to survive

41:41.411 --> 41:44.197
this coming Crisis,

41:44.240 --> 41:47.156
the Flash must die.
