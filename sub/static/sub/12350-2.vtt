13:42.282 --> 13:43.918
Oh, I wanted to surprise you.

13:43.919 --> 13:46.545
Thought maybe I could, uh,
cook you dinner?

13:46.546 --> 13:48.877
Cooking.
You're cooking me dinner?

13:48.878 --> 13:51.755
Yeah.

I have to admit, I've actually

14:19.396 --> 14:21.646
never cooked anything in this
kitchen.

14:21.647 --> 14:23.638
Wow, how very new york of you.

14:23.639 --> 14:25.595

14:26.348 --> 14:27.770
Well, just takes practice.

14:29.111 --> 14:31.718
I panic.
There are liquids, and oils,

14:31.719 --> 14:34.955
and meats getting burnt,
and it's too delicate.

14:35.994 --> 14:37.530
Are you saying I'm delicate?

14:40.051 --> 14:41.266
No.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.863
Look, cooking is just about

overcoming the fear of the
unknown by calmly implementing

We were out, now we're back.
What's this?

15:13.700 --> 15:17.398
Jake, this is my roommate
Sophia and her friend Connor.

15:17.399 --> 15:19.900

Wow.

secrets.

15:39.579 --> 15:40.884
We'd love to.

15:45.164 --> 15:46.990
- Thank God you're here.
- What is going on?

15:46.991 --> 15:49.319
Okay, I had plans to meet him
at a restaurant, and he just

15:49.320 --> 15:52.161
showed up with groceries. I
couldn't exactly tell him to leave.

15:52.162 --> 15:53.504
Yes, you could!

15:53.505 --> 15:55.669
And who just shows up
with groceries?

15:55.670 --> 15:59.580
That is definitely weird. I need
you to be straight up with me.

16:03.031 --> 16:04.751

- Not exactly.

Okay, then what exactly is he?

16:10.755 --> 16:13.397
They found another victim
this afternoon.

16:14.117 --> 16:16.454
- Her face melted off.
- What?

16:16.455 --> 16:18.492
She was dating Reese Hennessy.

16:18.493 --> 16:20.729
Okay, so he's the one.
He's our guy.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.164
The police think so.

16:22.165 --> 16:24.580
Okay, so, at least we know.

16:24.581 --> 16:26.857

- What's he doing?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.136
Same thing he was doing
when you left.

16:36.137 --> 16:38.101
- Cooking.
- Okay, but, like, a normal

16:38.102 --> 16:39.732
person cook, or like
a killer cook?

16:39.733 --> 16:42.029

This is a really stressful
and complicated situation.

16:46.417 --> 16:48.396
So, I really need you to behave.

16:48.397 --> 16:49.324
Look, I get it.

16:49.325 --> 16:51.894
This beautiful man might be
hiding something.

16:51.895 --> 16:53.874
He might not be
who he says he is.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.156
He could totally mess with
your life.

16:56.157 --> 16:58.474
Sounds a lot like dating in
new york.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.757
- We're staying.
- If he is the killer,

17:00.758 --> 17:02.523
he can't cut all our heads off.

17:02.524 --> 17:03.777
Are you sure?

17:03.778 --> 17:06.162
Yeah.
I do Krav Maga.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.506
always wanted to move to the
States.

17:25.507 --> 17:28.510
I went to law school in
Chicago, and then, when I got

17:28.511 --> 17:31.480
accepted into the law firm here,
I jumped at the chance.

17:32.309 --> 17:34.851
But, um, I never asked you.
Where did you grow up?

17:35.703 --> 17:37.567
Upstate, near Albany.

17:37.568 --> 17:39.432
Why'd you pick Brooklyn?

17:43.436 --> 17:46.769

remember the night we met.

17:46.770 --> 17:50.492
I was, um... I was looking across
the club, and I saw Lindy,

17:50.493 --> 17:54.876
and I had this weird feeling inside
of me that I needed to know her.

17:54.877 --> 17:56.378
Come on, you've never
told me this.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.438
That's Sophia for you.

17:57.439 --> 18:01.613
One of the kindest girls I know.
She loves to pick up strays.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.934
(Laughs) I'm serious!
It was like a past life thing.

18:05.935 --> 18:07.671
And then, she told me she just
got into town.

18:07.672 --> 18:11.162
Don't ask me why, but I insisted
she stay with me.

18:11.163 --> 18:14.088
(Chuckles) And I've never left.

18:15.192 --> 18:17.969
Is there a past life thing
between us, too?

18:17.970 --> 18:23.206

22:06.356 --> 22:08.142
Yep, 24 hours a day.

22:20.307 --> 22:24.233
Detective. Lindy thinks she can
help us with our investigation.

22:24.234 --> 22:27.223
She believes Reese Hennessy's
alibi is a fake.

22:27.224 --> 22:29.420
Wanna go on a date?

22:35.556 --> 22:38.422
With the spyware Lindy loaded
onto the suspect's phone,

22:38.423 --> 22:40.312
we have a much clearer idea
of their movements.

22:40.313 --> 22:43.034
Yes, and Resse Hennessy's
phone didn't move from his

22:43.035 --> 22:45.422
office when Emily was killed,
corroborating his alibi.

22:45.423 --> 22:49.967

What phone doesn't move one inch

22:49.968 --> 22:51.291

22:51.292 --> 22:52.280
Yeah, she has a point.

22:52.281 --> 22:53.896
Lindy, that's just a car roof.

22:55.894 --> 22:56.945
That's not.

22:56.946 --> 22:58.246
Do you know how many makes

22:58.247 --> 23:00.283
and models of that car are
listed in the Tri-state area?

23:00.284 --> 23:03.042
There's no view of the license
plate, how are we gonna prove this?

23:03.043 --> 23:04.233
His car is
state-of-the-art,

23:04.234 --> 23:06.778
entirely hackable.
Hard drive records all its

23:06.779 --> 23:09.829
telemetry... every turn,
tire pressure, fuel usage.

23:09.830 --> 23:12.078
- It could almost drive itself.
- His car gonna drive us all

23:12.079 --> 23:13.681
the way to his murderous lair?

23:13.682 --> 23:14.552
Detective?

23:17.490 --> 23:19.422
What if he snuck out of the
office and no one knew?

23:19.423 --> 23:22.163
The car will tell us exactly
where he was that day, and his

23:22.164 --> 23:23.317
alibi will fall apart.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.136
What we do know, is he's

23:24.137 --> 23:25.462
booked on a flight to Rome
tomorrow.

23:25.463 --> 23:27.600
He may be making a run for it,
so we're doing this.

23:27.601 --> 23:29.403
He lives in a secure building
on the waterfront.

23:29.404 --> 23:32.257
Drives out, drives in. Can't
get near it without a warrant.

23:32.258 --> 23:34.389
Well, actually, we're going
for sushi tonight.

23:34.390 --> 23:35.541
I asked him to pick me up.

23:35.542 --> 23:38.321
While she entertains Reese, you
retrieve all the data from his car.

23:38.322 --> 23:40.417
You've got five hours.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.824
Can I have a word?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.272
This isn't a good idea. She's
not trained for this, sergeant.

23:49.273 --> 23:49.882
We'll have eyes on her in the

23:49.883 --> 23:51.957
restaurant, he's not gonna try
anything in public.

23:51.958 --> 23:53.103
It's not him I'm worried about.

23:53.104 --> 23:56.099
I have no idea what she'll do
from one moment to the next.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.728
She's completely unreliable.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.226
- Reckless?
- Yes.

23:59.227 --> 24:00.510
That's why I like her.

24:00.511 --> 24:02.810
Reminds me of myself
at that age.

24:03.933 --> 24:06.958
You're not gonna ruin my little
trip down nostalgia lane, are you?

24:06.959 --> 24:09.590
There's nothing nostalgic
about you, sergeant.

24:09.591 --> 24:11.130
Do you wanna catch this guy?

24:11.165 --> 24:13.083
- Of course I do.
- Then, we need to trust that

24:13.084 --> 24:14.435
she might be on to something.

24:17.776 --> 24:20.172
Are you sure this is just
about catching a killer?

24:23.497 --> 24:28.554
Push this, detective. Push me, and
I will remove you from this case.

24:31.272 --> 24:33.194
Truth is, I prefer to have her
working with us,

24:33.195 --> 24:35.517

24:38.269 --> 24:42.692
