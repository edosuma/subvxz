07:59.146 --> 08:00.444
I... 'cause I have no fashion sense.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.512
None whatsoever.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.113
Oh, go on.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.983
[laughter]

08:04.985 --> 08:06.317
What do you mean? Look at you pointing

08:06.319 --> 08:07.851
when you got the same shirt on.

08:07.853 --> 08:09.286
I have to wear the same
thing every day here.

08:09.288 --> 08:12.524
It kills me. It kills me.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.427
What is it about, um, comic book fandom

08:15.428 --> 08:17.194
that everybody wants that issue

08:17.197 --> 08:18.663
where he changes the costume, why?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.264
'Cause they're like, "Finally.

08:20.266 --> 08:22.000
Maybe this'll change
the game a little bit."

08:22.002 --> 08:24.702
And it's gonna alter minor
things in terms of like,

08:24.704 --> 08:26.103
"Oh, I got pockets now,"

08:26.105 --> 08:28.706
and that's gotta change the story.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.509
Well, no costume changed
so big as ditching

08:31.511 --> 08:34.479
that heavy, wool, green
jacket you used to wear...

08:34.480 --> 08:35.813
- It's true.
- In hundred-degree weather.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.782
Yeah, that's true, man.

08:37.783 --> 08:40.851
Silent Bob's coat was mine
before it was Silent Bob's.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.453
I was like, "I like
wearing this in real life,

08:42.456 --> 08:44.188
so I'll wear it in the flick."

08:44.191 --> 08:45.956
And then when I would keep
wearing the coat in real life,

08:45.959 --> 08:47.558
people would be like, "Ew,
do you wear your costumes

08:47.561 --> 08:49.293
"from all your movies?

08:49.296 --> 08:52.864
Oh, my God!" [laughter]

08:52.865 --> 08:56.033
The book is very, very clean copy.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.702
I mean, there doesn't seem
to be any imperfections.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.206
You know, it's so nice
and snug in the Mylar,

09:01.207 --> 09:03.240
I don't even think I
need to take it out.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.143
All right, so what are
you looking to get for it?

09:05.144 --> 09:07.544
I'm looking for a hundred dollars.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.514
I couldn't... I couldn't go that high.

09:09.515 --> 09:12.384
Um, while it's a very key issue,

09:12.385 --> 09:14.052
it's not that uncommon though.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.086
So there's a lot of copies out there.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.255
Is there any chance you'd take 50?

09:18.258 --> 09:21.259
Um... can you do 85?

09:22.495 --> 09:24.328
I could do 65.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.529
But it's beautiful.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.365
It is. That's why...

09:27.366 --> 09:29.000
I mean, that's why I'm probably
paying a little bit more,

09:29.001 --> 09:32.437
because I am factoring
in that it is gorgeous.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.371
I don't know how you were able to find

09:34.374 --> 09:36.040
such a flawless copy.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.576
65?

09:38.577 --> 09:41.078
Hmm.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.746
I don't think I could do 65.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.515
- No?
- Uh-uh.

09:44.518 --> 09:46.051
All right, understood.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.619
Thanks for bringing it
in, though, and good luck.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.254
Thank you guys so
much. Have a great day.

That's cool. Ming, you all right?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.062

Dude, don't stare

10:02.607 --> 10:04.534
All-time favorite
"Spider-Man" artists.

10:04.802 --> 10:07.861
I'm gonna go first. Todd
McFarlane's Spider-Man.

10:08.176 --> 10:10.576
He just found a way to draw Spider-Man

10:10.578 --> 10:14.346
in these incredibly dynamic
comic book-worthy poses

10:14.349 --> 10:17.182
that years later, when they
finally made those movies,

10:17.184 --> 10:19.251
they would copy and bring to life.

10:19.254 --> 10:20.687
What about you?

10:20.688 --> 10:22.522
I gotta go with the guy
who created Spider-Man,

10:22.524 --> 10:23.755
Steve Ditko.

10:23.758 --> 10:25.857
He captured that spidery Spider-Man.

10:25.860 --> 10:28.094
You know, he was kinda like
a creepy-lookin' Spider-Man,

10:28.096 --> 10:29.495
but it's one of my favorites.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.364
Nice, man. What about you, Zap?

10:31.365 --> 10:33.600
My favorite was John Byrne.

10:33.601 --> 10:35.768
I loved his run on "Marvel Team-Up,"

10:35.769 --> 10:38.471
and you have him interacting
with the entire Marvel Universe.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.706
- What about you, Ming?
- I'm gonna go with Gil Kane.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.508
- Gil Kane, man!
- Yeah!

10:42.509 --> 10:44.177
Come on, you don't
even know who that is.

10:44.178 --> 10:46.645

Kane drew of Spider-Man?

11:49.618 --> 11:50.850
Is "Back to the Future"

11:50.852 --> 11:53.286
the best time traveling movie franchise?

11:53.288 --> 11:54.687
Well, in my opinion, it is.

11:54.690 --> 11:56.123
It's got some competition, though.

11:56.125 --> 11:57.524
- It does.
- "Terminator."

11:57.525 --> 11:59.192
I was gonna say, "Terminator."

11:59.193 --> 12:01.293
"Terminator" is a much
darker time travel concept

12:01.296 --> 12:02.662
than "Back to the Future."

12:02.663 --> 12:04.297
Yeah, the death of all mankind,

12:04.298 --> 12:08.355
versus going forward 30 years
in the future, the year 2015.

- Like, I'll never..."
- "I won't even be alive then."

12:18.378 --> 12:20.010
"Yeah, I wouldn't be
alive then, and if I am,

12:20.013 --> 12:21.278
we're gonna have flying cars."

12:21.280 --> 12:23.148
I'm gonna be as rich as Biff.

12:23.149 --> 12:24.349
[laughter]

12:24.350 --> 12:26.183
I love "Back to the Future," man.

12:26.186 --> 12:28.787
But the first movie that
captured my imagination

12:28.788 --> 12:32.524
about playing with time was
"The Land That Time Forgot."

12:32.525 --> 12:34.292
- Edgar Rice Burroughs, right?
- Yes!

12:34.293 --> 12:36.628
It was about normal people
in their present day and age

12:36.629 --> 12:38.529
suddenly encountering dinosaurs.

12:38.532 --> 12:40.365
He did "The Lost World"
and "Jurassic Park"

12:40.366 --> 12:41.966
long before they did.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.235
I'm gonna go a little bit more obscure,

12:43.236 --> 12:45.202
but mine was "Time After Time."

12:45.205 --> 12:48.173
Oh, it's a great movie,
and not obscure, by the way.

12:48.174 --> 12:49.573
- It's not obscure?
- No!

12:49.576 --> 12:51.876
This is the movie in which H.G. Wells,

12:51.879 --> 12:53.477
played by Malcolm McDowell,

12:53.480 --> 12:56.715
he is chasing Jack
the Ripper through time

12:56.716 --> 12:58.716
in a time machine that Wells built.

12:58.719 --> 13:01.519
It's an incredibly
imaginative story, man.

13:01.522 --> 13:03.254
Every time I bring it up,
like at a dinner party,

13:03.256 --> 13:05.557
nobody knows what I'm talking about.

13:05.558 --> 13:09.027
Has everyone seen that new
"Time After Time" picture yet?

13:09.028 --> 13:12.197
[laughter]

13:12.198 --> 13:13.398
So where did you get the, uh,

13:13.399 --> 13:15.033
the Christopher Lloyd signature from?

13:15.034 --> 13:16.835
So the Christopher Lloyd
signature was acquired

13:16.836 --> 13:18.336
at a comic-con in south Jersey,

13:18.337 --> 13:20.172
about two years ago.

13:20.173 --> 13:22.206
I've heard rumors that they're
gonna remake the franchise.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.942
Would you guys be
interested in seeing that?

13:23.943 --> 13:25.844
Robert Zemeckis recently said that

13:25.846 --> 13:28.346
while he is still alive,
that will never happen.

13:28.347 --> 13:29.914
You know, I have to think
at some point though,

13:29.917 --> 13:31.883
it'll... it'll happen.

13:31.884 --> 13:34.619
Who's your choice for Marty?

13:34.620 --> 13:36.554
Do you even know anybody today?

13:36.557 --> 13:38.088
Young actors?

13:38.091 --> 13:40.125
Would the Bie... Bieber be a choice?

13:40.126 --> 13:42.527
He looks kinda like a young
Marty McFly, doesn't he?

13:42.528 --> 13:44.296
How dare you even suggest it.

13:44.298 --> 13:45.931
- He's not in?
- No, God, there'd be a riot.

13:45.932 --> 13:47.365
I'd probably light all
my memorabilia on fire

13:47.366 --> 13:49.600
and just walk away. [laughter]

13:49.602 --> 13:52.403
It seems like it's a question
that we ask constantly.

13:52.405 --> 13:54.471
Will they remake "Back to the Future"?

13:54.474 --> 13:56.207
- Not in our lifetime.
- Why, though?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.409
They gotta wait till kids can't remember

13:58.412 --> 14:00.412
this movie at all before they're like,

14:00.413 --> 14:02.447
"Here's a new Marty McFly."

14:34.981 --> 14:36.413

What you're asking for it is in the area

14:38.251 --> 14:40.118

to get for it though.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.788

14:44.790 --> 14:46.658

14:48.128 --> 14:51.328
