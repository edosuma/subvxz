WEBVTT

00:06.272 --> 00:08.474
- Good morning.
- Quarterfinals in an hour.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.209
Hope you got some sleep,

00:10.211 --> 00:12.378
'cause I am gonna be haunting
your nightmares tonight.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.480
- I did.
I got some really good sleep.

00:14.482 --> 00:17.449
- Did you?
- Zzz.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.353
- Yesterday
was the first round

00:21.355 --> 00:23.188
Of a branch-wide
paper airplane contest.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.457
It was being sponsored
by weyerhammer paper

00:25.459 --> 00:28.260
In an effort to get us to sell
more of their new product,

00:28.262 --> 00:33.098
Airstream deluxe a4,
the cadillac of paper.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.200
It's not so easy
on the environment,

00:35.202 --> 00:36.435
If you know what I mean.

00:36.437 --> 00:39.304
It's practically made
of plastic.

00:39.306 --> 00:41.407
- We started
with 16 brave aviators.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.410
Some used skill.
[cheers and applause]

00:44.412 --> 00:46.512
Others relied
on showmanship.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.247
[aww-ing]

00:48.249 --> 00:52.251
Others seemed not to comprehend
what a paper airplane is.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.352
And of course
there was the odd moment

00:53.354 --> 00:55.387
Of heartbreak and disaster.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.122
- Hey, I left my glasses
down here somewhere.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.557
Crossing through.
Beep beep.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.392
Ow!

01:00.394 --> 01:01.260
Ow!
[all gasping]

01:01.262 --> 01:02.327
- I didn't see you.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.595
You should have yelled,
"crossing"!

01:03.597 --> 01:06.532
- I'm sorry.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.535
- Okay, so is that my spot?

01:09.537 --> 01:12.237
- We are now down to
an elite eight.

01:12.239 --> 01:15.441
Well, seven and toby.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.444
[cheerful music]

01:18.446 --> 01:25.250
â™ª

01:25.252 --> 01:28.320
- "be careful of that beaker.
It contains dangerous acid!"

01:28.322 --> 01:29.621
- It does not say "dangerous."

01:29.623 --> 01:31.390
And there's
no exclamation point.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.560
- Well, I'm just--I'm trying
to bring some life to it.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.861
Last week I got an agent.

01:35.863 --> 01:39.264
And this week I got a movie.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.266
<i>Hrpdc chemical handling</i>
<i>protocols.</i>

01:41.268 --> 01:43.368
It's gonna be seen
by tons of workers

01:43.370 --> 01:45.204
In the industrial chemical
community,

01:45.206 --> 01:49.308
One of whom could have a cousin
whose brother is brad pitt.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.344
And then, boom,
next thing you know,

01:52.346 --> 01:54.213
I'm in <i>moneyballs 2.</i>

01:54.215 --> 01:56.882
- Andy.
- Go away. We're running lines.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.817
- You wanted
to see the gooey eye.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.286
- Oh, yeah.
All right, get over here.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.322
I am so freaked out

02:03.324 --> 02:06.158
By things going into eyes.

02:06.160 --> 02:11.363
It just--wow.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.397
Ugh.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.800
Ugh.
I can't even.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.336
I'm so freaked out by that.
Just go. Go, go, go, go, go.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.504
- All right,
but it's getting gooier,

02:18.506 --> 02:21.673
So we'll just do it later.
- Okay.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.709
- All right.
Where were we?

02:23.711 --> 02:25.377
- Something full of acid.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.246
- "and, remember,
do not attempt

02:27.248 --> 02:29.348
"to extinguish a chemical fire
with water.

02:29.350 --> 02:33.519
It will only exacerbate
the flame, the dangerous flame."

02:33.521 --> 02:34.820
- That was great, man.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.288
All right,
I'm out of here.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.257
- Wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop, stop.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.326
Don't go anywhere.
I just need to find more colors.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.696
Let's do it six more times.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.367
- Hey.
I just wanted to say

02:48.369 --> 02:51.336
That you woke up early
with the kids and let me sleep,

02:51.338 --> 02:53.906
And I really appreciate that.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.440
- Thank you.

02:55.442 --> 02:58.343
I appreciate
that you appreciate that.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.546
So we had couples therapy.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.681
- No shame in that.
Get it all out in the open.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.916
- And we have homework.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.651
- Yes, we are supposed to look
for every chance

03:05.653 --> 03:08.954
To acknowledge and appreciate
each other's sacrifices,

03:08.956 --> 03:12.357
Because I need to appreciate
what pam's been doing

03:12.359 --> 03:13.692
To run the house
while I'm in philly.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.461
- And we're also supposed
to speak our truths,

03:16.463 --> 03:19.364
Because, if I had spoken
my truth earlier

03:19.366 --> 03:20.832
About not wanting
to move to philly,

03:20.834 --> 03:23.669
Then maybe we wouldn't have
had this opportunity

03:23.671 --> 03:25.604
For couples therapy.
- Oh, we're supposed to call

03:25.606 --> 03:28.273
Everything we don't want to do
opportunities.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.342
- Heads up, everyone.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.411
If you really need something
from me today,

03:32.413 --> 03:34.513
Let's get it done tomorrow.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.281
Carla fern got me a gig.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.849
- Hey.
- Yeah.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.284
- Who's carla fern?

03:39.286 --> 03:43.288
- Who is carla fern?
Well, wow.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.958
She's my agent
and my drill sergeant.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.859
And one of my best friends.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.429
Oh, and, oscar,
I already figured out

03:50.431 --> 03:51.964
If I have to get emotional
in the film,

03:51.966 --> 03:53.865
I'm just gonna think about you
getting dumped by the senator.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.601
- Why don't you just use
your own life?

03:55.603 --> 03:57.402
Erin just dumped you.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.972
- A little raw.
Not cool, oscar.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.640
- But you just--
- not cool.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.642
- Okay.
Day two.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.345
Drama in the warehouse skies.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.314
This is robert
from weyerhammer paper

04:09.316 --> 04:11.984
Who will be joining us
to judge the final rounds.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.518
- Who's pumped
for the quarterfinals, huh?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.820
- I'm pumped.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.022
- Clark's a dead man.
- All right.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.791
Sounds like somebody wants
to walk away with this.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.360
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow.

04:21.362 --> 04:24.696
- Nellie, you didn't tell us
we could win money.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.766
- Oh, yes, I did.
I told you all.

04:27.768 --> 04:32.804
It was--'cause that's an awful
lot of money for me to forget.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.874
- Not one of us remembers you
saying anything about $2,000.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.442
- I forgot.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.044
I completely forgot.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.879
But at least now
that large piece of cardboard

04:40.881 --> 04:42.681
That man was carrying around
makes sense.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.950
- Nellie,
this is a competition.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.285
Please take it seriously.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.487
- Oh, please.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.889
- Me?
Oh, I'm fine.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.059
I mean, sure, times are leaner
now that I'm separated

04:54.061 --> 04:57.062
From the senator,
but my new studio apartment

04:57.064 --> 05:01.533
Is just fine
for me and phillip

05:01.535 --> 05:04.002
And tinkie and crinklepuss

05:04.004 --> 05:06.772
And bandit two
and pawlick baggins

05:06.774 --> 05:10.409
And lady aragorn
and their ten kittens.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.710
- [baby screaming, crying]

05:11.712 --> 05:13.979
- Oh, my god.
Come here, come here.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.047
Come here, let's go.

05:15.049 --> 05:16.548
I had a chance with dwight,

05:16.550 --> 05:17.549
But I didn't take it.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.351
And, if I went back now,

05:19.353 --> 05:22.954
When I'm broke
and he just inherited a farm,

05:22.956 --> 05:25.724
I'd be one of those gold-digging
tramps you read about

05:25.726 --> 05:28.760
That try to bag a farmer.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.829
- I offered myself to angela,
and she turned me down.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.999
If she changes her mind,
the next move is hers.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.468
I'm with esther now.
She's younger than angela,

05:36.470 --> 05:39.438
Sturdier,
more comfortable with the scent

05:39.440 --> 05:40.839
Of a manured field.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.407
Let's be honest,

05:42.409 --> 05:44.376
When it came to manured fields,

05:44.378 --> 05:46.511
Angela was
at best indifferent.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.719
- Oh, - hey.Ings.
Why don't you back off?

05:55.021 --> 05:58.090
I mean, best of luck to you
in the competition.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.624
Growing up in an orphanage,

05:59.626 --> 06:01.526
You have to fight other kids
for everything--

06:01.528 --> 06:04.830
Snacks, pillows,
parents.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.799
I'm kind of worried about pete
seeing that side of me.

06:07.801 --> 06:11.403
I once ripped greedy susan's
pigtail right off her head

06:11.405 --> 06:13.572
Just for a handful
of crispix.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.375
- Are you
in that paper documentary too?

06:16.377 --> 06:17.476
- Yup.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.511
- You need an agent?
- No.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.581
I mean, you never acted
in anything before.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.117
He's just my entourage.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.018
- I was in <i>the wiz</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

06:27.020 --> 06:29.488
- That's the clicky-clacker.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.591
He clicks that,
and then the guy says, "action."

06:32.593 --> 06:35.627
- Hey, I made 'em
get you a chair.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.497
All my clients sit.

06:38.499 --> 06:42.968
- Can I take your picture?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.770
- I guess it's starting.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.773
Um, yeah.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.574
Of course.
Yeah, sure.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.511
I'll put my arm around you,
and then I can take it--

06:52.513 --> 06:53.612
- We just need a picture of
the top of your head

06:53.614 --> 06:56.181
In case we burn
some of your hair off.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.016
- Got it.

07:02.688 --> 07:03.955
Sorry.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.891
- No, if you just keep it down
until...

07:05.893 --> 07:07.959
- Okay.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.762
- Okay, next up
we have two creatures

07:10.764 --> 07:12.097
Great and small--

07:12.099 --> 07:14.065
Kevin versus angela.

07:14.067 --> 07:18.770
- Yes.
[applause]

07:18.772 --> 07:22.607
- Hey, that is
a really nice plane.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.142
You make that yourself?

07:24.144 --> 07:26.545
- Uh-huh.
- Well, what am I thinking?

07:26.547 --> 07:28.180
Of course you made that
yourself,

07:28.182 --> 07:30.215
'cause it's in the rules

07:30.217 --> 07:33.585
That you have to fold
your own plane.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.954
- Of course.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.090
- Kevin, did you make that
yourself?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.660
- Yes.
In a way.

07:41.662 --> 07:45.664
From one that I bought
on craigslist.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.865
- Oh, man.
- I call for a refold.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.800
- No.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.702
- Really?
- You can't do that.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.103
Thank you.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.605
- This is flatter.

07:53.607 --> 07:54.606
- It's a piece of paper.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.174
You fold it into an airplane.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.845
- Okay, that's enough.
This is the end of the ream now.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.746
You have to pick one.
- I can't.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.115
I love them all too much.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.651
And none of them fly.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.653
So that makes it harder.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.489
- You have to choose one now.

08:10.491 --> 08:14.025
- Fine.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.131
- Angela advances.
- Nice.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.666
- Whoo!

08:21.668 --> 08:23.668
- Was dwight rooting for me?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.539
Hmm.
I hadn't noticed.

08:27.541 --> 08:28.640
- I'm not giving up.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.775
I am gonna keep making planes

08:30.777 --> 08:32.511
Until one of 'em flies.

08:32.513 --> 08:36.281
Like wilbur and orville
redenbacher.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.553
- An earl grey tea
for the lady.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.788
- Oh, thank you.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.291
I acknowledge and appreciate
that you went out of your way

08:46.293 --> 08:48.927
To get me tea.
- Thank you.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.629
I like being appreciated.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.796
But, to speak my truth,

08:51.798 --> 08:53.532
It wasn't out of the way,

08:53.534 --> 08:55.767
'cause I felt like a tea anyway,
so one trip.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.672
- Well, to speak my truth,

09:00.674 --> 09:02.941
I switched to coffee
in March.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.710
There's a new espresso machine.

09:05.712 --> 09:09.581
But I still acknowledge
and appreciate the gesture.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.753
- We are rolling,
and action.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.621
- This video is to demonstrate

09:16.623 --> 09:19.190
The hprdc chemical handling
protocols.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.859
These protocols could save you

09:20.861 --> 09:23.228
From severe injury,
even death.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.063
- Okay, stop.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.598
Why are you smiling?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.567
- I just made a character choice
to be a scientist

09:28.569 --> 09:31.236
Who really likes
what he does

09:31.238 --> 09:33.171
And enjoys his job.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.840
- Okay, well,
maybe no smiling on this one.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.175
- So how do you want--
how should I do it?

09:37.177 --> 09:38.843
- I don't know.
Just like you're reporting

09:38.845 --> 09:40.312
The news or something.
Okay?

09:40.314 --> 09:43.582
Action.
- This video is to demonstrate

09:43.584 --> 09:47.686
The hprdc chemical handling
protocols.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.654
It's tom brokaw, the newscaster.
Come on.

09:49.656 --> 09:50.789
- Who was that?
- Tom brokaw.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.963
- Come on, clark!
- Come on, clark!

09:57.965 --> 10:00.765
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

10:00.767 --> 10:03.234
Oh, eat it, piggy.
Eat it.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.337
- We still got
to work together,

10:05.339 --> 10:06.705
So we should keep it civil.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.772
- [snorting]

10:07.774 --> 10:09.007
I can't hear what you said.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.241
[snorting]

10:10.243 --> 10:11.943
You get your slop?
[imitating pig squealing]

10:11.945 --> 10:13.812
- All right, you know what,
this is completely unnecessary.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.680
You already won.
Just stop.

10:15.682 --> 10:16.781
- Erin.
- What?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.850
- Relax.
- Next up we have dwight

10:18.852 --> 10:20.885
And phyllis.
- You can do it, baby.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.854
- No, you can't, baby.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.023
You're gonna choke.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.863
- Watch and learn.
- Wow.

10:31.865 --> 10:35.767
- Whoa, dwight defeats phyllis.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.002
Dwight, you are through
to the semifinals.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.903
- Yes.
- All right.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.739
- Oh, esther,
what are you--

10:40.741 --> 10:43.808
- Hey.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.078
- You're here early.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.713
- Yeah, I plucked the chickens
extra fast,

10:48.715 --> 10:50.348
'cause I knew
I was seeing you tonight, so...

10:50.350 --> 10:51.916
There might just be
a little bit of feather

10:51.918 --> 10:53.418
In your nuggets
or just a little bit of meat

10:53.420 --> 10:54.786
Inside of your pillow.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.721
- I like a little feather
in my nuggets.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.823
[laughter]

10:58.825 --> 10:59.958
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

10:59.960 --> 11:02.260
We are now down
to the final four--

11:02.262 --> 11:04.095
Dwight, erin,

11:04.097 --> 11:08.733
Angela, and, god only knows how,
but toby.

11:08.735 --> 11:12.737
One of you will walk away
with $2,000.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.439
- Yeah!

11:14.441 --> 11:17.042
- Okay, here you have
just knocked over the beaker.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.210
The chemicals splashed
in your eye.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.945
- Which is insanely painful.
- Yeah.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.081
- And I've already picked
a few childhood memories

11:23.083 --> 11:25.917
To tap into to really express
that pain.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.919
- That's great.
So what you're gonna do then

11:27.921 --> 11:30.955
Is come over here
to the eye washing station

11:30.957 --> 11:32.857
And then just kind of flush out
your eyes, you know,

11:32.859 --> 11:36.895
Get the chemicals out,
all right?

11:36.897 --> 11:39.264
- So I just lean over this thing
and then you'll add

11:39.266 --> 11:41.466
The water special effect later?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.268
- What water special effect?

11:43.270 --> 11:45.804
- Yeah, just hold your lids open
with one hand

11:45.806 --> 11:48.473
And let the stream
bathe your eyeballs.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.442
Like that.

11:50.444 --> 11:53.111
- I'm not comfortable
doing my own stunts.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.780
I'll get nude
if you want me to.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.982
I'll go full lena dunham,
but I--

11:57.984 --> 11:59.918
- Dude, we don't need you
to go nude, okay?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.053
- Just do the eyewash thing,
okay?

12:02.055 --> 12:06.424
That's all we're asking here.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.992
- Darryl, what do I do?

12:07.994 --> 12:09.994
- Hold up, I'm looking
at my spit in the microscope.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.997
- They want me to use real water
in the eyewash scene.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.165
- So?

12:14.167 --> 12:16.768
- I can't squirt stuff
in my eyeball.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.136
I've never even used
an eyedropper.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.338
- So, andy,
you saw how to use this?

12:20.340 --> 12:24.743
You step on the pedal.
Water squirts in your eyes.

12:24.745 --> 12:28.446
- Carla!

12:28.448 --> 12:29.881
Carla!

12:29.883 --> 12:32.117
- It is time
for a little "t" and "a."

12:32.119 --> 12:34.953
I give you toby and angela.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.525
- Oh, my god!

12:41.761 --> 12:45.964
Oh, my god.
Okay, it's your turn.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.938
- Well, angela is the winner.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.775
- Yes.

12:58.077 --> 13:00.512
- Is there a reason that we're
excited for that little woman?

13:00.514 --> 13:02.113
- Yes, I pity her.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.548
She was recently
in a situation

13:03.550 --> 13:06.451
Where she could have had it all,

13:06.453 --> 13:08.386
And instead
she lost everything.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.789
- Is she a gambler?

13:10.791 --> 13:13.558
- In a way, but not in a
stand-up-and-cheer kind of way

13:13.560 --> 13:15.927
Like the song.
- Mm.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.129
That is sad.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.100
- Andy, if you don't stick
your eyes in that machine,

13:22.102 --> 13:26.037
I'm gonna call every production
in northeastern pennsylvania.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.039
You won't even make
an appearance

13:28.041 --> 13:31.943
On a security camera.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.515
- What's the holdup here?

13:37.517 --> 13:39.818
- The actor's crying.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.419
- Oh, god.

13:44.023 --> 13:48.026
- She yelled at me.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.196
I can't wash my eyeball.
I can't do that.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.430
I can't.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.399
- Andy bernard can't squirt
water in his eye

13:54.401 --> 13:57.202
And act like it
doesn't freak him out.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.171
But you know who can?

14:00.173 --> 14:03.875
Older male lab assistant
number one.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.944
- You believe in me?

14:05.946 --> 14:10.014
- I believe...
I want to go home.

14:12.852 --> 14:17.922
- Yeah!
Okay. Beat that.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.463
[chuckles]
whoo!

14:25.465 --> 14:27.866
Okay.
- Damn it!

14:27.868 --> 14:29.167
Damn it!

14:29.169 --> 14:32.337
God--sorry.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.605
- Okay.
- I got mad.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.306
- Yeah.
- 'cause I don't like losing,

14:35.308 --> 14:36.574
Pete.
I just gotta--

14:36.576 --> 14:38.042
Sorry, I'm mad, pete.
I'm mad.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.444
I'm really mad.
I wanted to win.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.445
We were gonna win
a lot of money.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.913
I was gonna buy you a sweater.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.882
It's just the whole contest
is stupid,

14:43.884 --> 14:46.084
So it feels--
- oh!

14:46.086 --> 14:47.886
- Sorry, I'm mad.
- Okay.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.621
- I don't like losing.
I thought I was going to win.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.489
- Okay, hey, hey, hey.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.658
- Sorry. Sorry.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.159
I'm gonna go upstairs
and just...

14:55.161 --> 14:57.562
- Oh, I made us a date

14:57.564 --> 14:58.963
To take my mom out to dinner

14:58.965 --> 15:00.365
To thank her
for all that extra babysitting.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.367
- Well, you know
how much I appreciate

15:02.369 --> 15:05.103
The opportunity
to hang out with your mom more,

15:05.105 --> 15:06.638
So let me just put this
in my calendar.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.640
- I acknowledge
with gratitude

15:08.642 --> 15:10.508
That you are being
kind and responsible enough

15:10.510 --> 15:12.443
To include it
in your calendar.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.612
- Thank you.
Your mom is a treasure.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.614
- Well, I appreciate...
[cell phone chimes]

15:16.616 --> 15:20.919
Hey, wade, did cole hamels
call back or what?

15:20.921 --> 15:22.954
Great.
Good.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.023
- To speak my truth,
I'd appreciate it

15:25.025 --> 15:26.357
If you hung that up,
'cause we were in the middle

15:26.359 --> 15:28.593
Of a conversation.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.998
I appreciate the sacrifice.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.567
- Okay, to speak my truth,

15:36.569 --> 15:39.003
That was a little sarcastic.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.171
I think
that's a little unfair.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.372
- Really?

15:41.374 --> 15:43.007
I've been putting the kids
to bed by myself

15:43.009 --> 15:44.575
Every night for months.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.611
And you had to miss
one phone call.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.680
Is that your truth, jim?
That's really your truth?

15:48.682 --> 15:52.183
- I guess I will swallow
my truth.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.952
- Are you guys high?

15:53.954 --> 15:56.454
Because, if so,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.323
To speak my truth,
I would appreciate

15:58.325 --> 16:00.992
The sacrifice
of including me

16:00.994 --> 16:03.294
In some hits
off your kind buds.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.963
- We're not high.

16:04.965 --> 16:08.533
I wish we'd started
this exercise six months ago.

16:08.535 --> 16:12.637
My heart just feels
so...Blocked up.

16:20.012 --> 16:25.116
- The mark 47
is ready for launch.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.318
Less paste.

16:31.323 --> 16:36.260
- Here we go.
Rolling and action.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.463
- [screaming]

16:42.001 --> 16:45.036
- And cut.
We can fix the sound in post.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.671
- Yeah.
- I can do a better one.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.206
- That's fine.
We'll move on.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.009
- I said
I can do a better one.

16:51.011 --> 16:54.078
- Darryl.
- Action.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.084
- [screaming]

17:06.358 --> 17:09.394
- Kid can act.

17:10.562 --> 17:14.132
- Yeah.
Yeah.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.734
- Each contestant
will throw two aeroplanes.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.436
- After you.

17:18.438 --> 17:21.339
- Thank you.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.675
Oh, god.

17:24.677 --> 17:27.478
- Angela's first throw--
terrible.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.547
Dwight.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.650
- Oh!
Oh, man!

17:32.652 --> 17:34.519
It slipped out of my hand.
What a whiff.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.221
Ah, how'd that happen?
God.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.290
- We want you to win.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.758
Dwight told me
about your situation.

17:40.760 --> 17:45.496
It's such a pity.
Use the money wisely.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.672
- All right.

17:54.674 --> 17:58.509
- Don't you dare tank this.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.257
[plane lands]

18:13.259 --> 18:14.525
- And we have a winner.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.194
And it's dwight.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.263
And it is everyone,
because this is over.

18:20.399 --> 18:21.866
- 2 grand, huh?

18:21.868 --> 18:25.103
I know a guy who can turn
that into $800.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.604
And it's me.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.739
- Well, I guess
you needed the money

18:28.741 --> 18:31.342
More than me, huh?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.277
Use it wisely.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.748
I was disappointed
in dwight today.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.218
He showed a weakness
that was unbecoming.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.320
Even if he did do it for me.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.322
I don't need pity,

18:44.324 --> 18:46.424
And I don't need charity.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.693
I have my dignity,
and that's enough.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.228
And, as long as I have that,

18:50.230 --> 18:55.666
I'll be okay.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.276
- I know this
was really weird,

19:05.278 --> 19:07.678
And it was really hard.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.215
But I think
we're making progress.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.151
So I'm really sorry
that I have to go,

19:13.153 --> 19:16.721
But let's keep at this.

19:16.723 --> 19:19.524
Okay?
- Okay.

19:26.231 --> 19:29.300
[typing]

20:00.499 --> 20:02.400
Jim!

20:08.874 --> 20:10.541
- Thanks.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.578
- All right, have a good trip.
Both: Bye.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.548
- Hey.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.523
I...

20:42.474 --> 20:44.475
- "love suffers long
and is kind.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.445
"it is not proud.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.780
"love bears all things,

20:49.782 --> 20:52.383
"believes all things,

20:52.385 --> 20:56.821
"hopes all things,
and endures all things.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.423
"love never fails.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.292
"and now these three remain:

21:01.294 --> 21:05.863
"faith, hope, and love.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.368
But the greatest of these
is love."

21:16.742 --> 21:19.343
Both: I love you.
