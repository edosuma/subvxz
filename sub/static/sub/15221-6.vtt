00:08.908 --> 00:10.842

00:15.448 --> 00:18.042
<i>He awoke to find himself</i>
<i>trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.118 --> 00:21.713
<i>facing mirror images</i>
<i>that were not his own,</i>

00:21.788 --> 00:25.918

00:27.093 --> 00:31.029
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,</i>
<i>an observer from his own time,</i>

<i>who appears in the form of a hologram</i>
<i>that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.803 --> 00:41.103
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself</i>
<i>leaping from life to life,</i>

<i>striving to put right</i>
<i>what once went wrong,</i>

I don't think so.

<i>[ Doctor ]</i>
<i>She's obviously confused.</i>
<i>Can't you give her a few minutes?</i>

02:54.474 --> 02:57.807
It's better if we go over this

You said you were driven
to Fort Cronkite against your will,

03:01.748 --> 03:04.239

Is that correct?

03:04.317 --> 03:07.616
Well, I, uh-
Katie, sometimes
when a girl gets raped,

03:07.687 --> 03:10.383
she's too ashamed to press charges.

03:10.456 --> 03:15.189
But unless the man who did this to you
is stopped, he'll do it again.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.229
- I must be here to press charges.
- What?

03:19.299 --> 03:21.096
I want to press charges.

<i>Isn't that enough for tonight?</i>
<i>She needs rest.</i>

Why don't you go ahead
and get dressed?

03:27.774 --> 03:29.867
Did you bring your sister
some clothes?
Yeah, brought these.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.638
I'll need those for evidence.

Thank you.
Katie, I'll see you in a minute.

- What're we gonna tell Mom and Dad?
- You tell them the truth, Libby.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.611
Everybody needs to be
real honest right now.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.658

what he looked like?

03:46.726 --> 03:49.889
Well, it was kind of-
It's Kevin Wentworth.

03:49.963 --> 03:53.160
Charles and Sally's boy?

03:53.233 --> 03:57.226
My son was in scouts with Kevin.
Is he your boyfriend?

03:57.303 --> 03:59.635
Oh, uh-
I wouldn't say a couple of dates...

03:59.706 --> 04:02.732

No, I wouldn't either.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.175
I want you to have this
filled on your way out.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.408
And I want you to take
two tonight at bedtime,

04:08.481 --> 04:12.178
and then you can just follow
the instructions on the label.

04:12.252 --> 04:17.120
Valium? That's an antianxiety drug.
It'll help you to sleep.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.589
Things look different in the morning.
Different?

04:19.659 --> 04:22.628
You'll see.
Take care, Katie.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.754
Here.
What's this?

04:24.831 --> 04:28.164
It's a bill. You can
take care of it on the way out.

04:32.005 --> 04:36.499
What are you doing?
That's supposed to help.
Trust me. It won't.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.204
Damn it.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.611
This isn't real.

04:41.681 --> 04:45.845
Rape doesn't happen to my family.
It happens to strangers on the news.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.014
Not to my sister.

04:51.491 --> 04:54.153
I'll go pay this.

[ Chuckles ]

05:24.524 --> 05:27.584
Katie, I'm gonna refer this
to the D.A.'s office tomorrow.

But before I do, I have to know.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.190
How bad do you want
to get this Wentworth guy?

05:32.265 --> 05:36.463
I'll do whatever it takes.
That's good.
That's real good.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.699
But I don't want to get your hopes up,
'cause they might not take the case.
Why not?

05:39.772 --> 05:44.971
Well, nobody likes a tough fight.
And that's exactly what it'll be
since Kevin was your date.

05:45.044 --> 05:49.208
Of course, those bruises
can make quite an impact.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.274
It's hard to turn down a case
when the victim's staring back at you.
Is that it?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.320
You got it.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.845
The D.A.'s office,
1 0:00 tomorrow?

05:57.924 --> 06:00.449

Okay.

Oh, my God.
Katie.

06:11.504 --> 06:15.031
- Bastard.
Get the hell away from my sister.
- I just want to talk to her.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.009
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Come on, Katie.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.068
Are you all right, Katie?
Do I look all right?

06:20.146 --> 06:22.307
I'm scared half out of my wits.

06:22.382 --> 06:27.115
First you run out on me,
and then you jump into a strange car.
I mean, thank God, I followed you.

06:27.186 --> 06:30.053
She wouldn't have jumped into
a strange car if you hadn't raped her.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.388
Rape? Is that what
you're telling everybody?

06:33.459 --> 06:36.087
That's what I told the police,
and what I'm gonna tell
the D.A.'S office tomorrow.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.323
Katie, I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

06:38.398 --> 06:41.162
Because I was raped.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.566
I didn't rape you, Katie.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.831
I didn't do it!

06:49.909 --> 06:53.868
<i>Oh, my God. My God.</i>
<i>Someone raped my baby.</i>

06:53.946 --> 06:56.938
You were raped?
I'm calling the police.

06:57.016 --> 06:59.507
I already filed a report
with the police.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.847
- Where the hell was Kevin?
- He's the one who raped her.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.254
Oh, not Kevin.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.955
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm gonna find that boy,
and I'm gonna kill him.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.123
We've gone to church
with the Wentworths for years.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.599
Wasn't there anybody else around?
Did-Did you cry out?

07:15.668 --> 07:19.399
- I can't remember.
- Who'd hear her up at
Fort Cronkite, the seagulls?

07:19.472 --> 07:21.667
Somebody would have heard.
Did you try to fight back?
Daddy.

07:21.741 --> 07:24.505
Did you try the car door?
Did you try to run away?
Daddy, stop it.

07:24.577 --> 07:28.479
What difference does it make?
She was raped. He raped our daughter.
Look, I don't know what difference it makes.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.278
Well, she's been through enough
without you giving her the third degree.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.619
I'm sorry, baby.

07:34.687 --> 07:38.521
Come on, let's get you
in the shower and into bed.
We can't do anything more tonight.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.650

<i>I thought I should do something,</i>
<i>like I should say something.</i>

07:48.134 --> 07:50.625
We can't change
anything that happened.

07:51.838 --> 07:55.137
All we can do is fix it
so that Kevin doesn't do it again.

How are you?
[ Sam's Voice ]
I'm okay.

08:17.864 --> 08:21.766
Katie, I was thinking.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.032
What if you go to the police tomorrow
and say you don't want to press charges?

08:29.675 --> 08:31.336
Why would I do that?

08:31.410 --> 08:34.868
- <i>Dragging the police into it</i>
<i>will only make it worse.</i>
- <i>For who?</i>

08:36.082 --> 08:38.015
I'm not gonna let Kevin
get away with this.

08:39.184 --> 08:44.020
Katie, when you told me
about your date with Kevin,

08:44.090 --> 08:46.058
I was really excited for you.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.059
I thought he was such a neat guy,

08:48.127 --> 08:51.619
even though Paula Fletcher
had her hooks in him for two years.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.696
But then when you
called me from the hospital,

08:56.769 --> 08:59.704
and said he raped you-
You didn't believe me.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.868
Well, you've always
been such a tease, and...

09:03.943 --> 09:06.776
Ifigured you finally went too far.

09:06.846 --> 09:10.009
Even if that's true, that doesn't
give Kevin the right to commit rape.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.448
No, of course not.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.819
But it's-it's so hard to believe.

09:16.889 --> 09:20.120
I mean, Kevin has half the girls
in this stupid town after him. Why-

09:20.192 --> 09:22.558
Why would he rape me?

09:22.628 --> 09:24.721
I didn't mean that.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.789
<i>It's just that he's such</i>
<i>a hero in this town.</i>

09:29.402 --> 09:32.394
Do you really think people
are going to believe you over him?

09:32.471 --> 09:36.168

but I'm not gonna back off.

Oh. Uh, did they get
the nozzle that did it?
Well, yes and no.

10:24.757 --> 10:28.818
I mean, she went out with this guy
a couple of times, so no one
will believe that it was rape.

but she really means 'yes''' crapola?
Yeah.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.400

<i>Is that gonna be a problem?</i>
Katie, in cases like yours,

14:10.983 --> 14:14.419
Your new fishing rod, eh?
That's serious.

14:17.756 --> 14:20.725
Look, I don't mean to make
light of this situation, but...

14:20.793 --> 14:23.728
I've gotta be at a hearing
in 1 0 minutes.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.529
Katie, I'll tell you what.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.866
<i>Tell you what,</i>
<i>I'll review this file.</i>

14:31.937 --> 14:34.770
Come back after lunch. Alone.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.832
You're hurting my feelings.
I'll be back. Thanks.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.276
And I really am sorry.

14:43.249 --> 14:46.218
Shumway, what would I do
with your new fishing rod anyway?

14:46.285 --> 14:48.219
I'd-

14:48.287 --> 14:50.482
You'd loan it to me
every weekend.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.902
They're over there.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.666
<i>Mom, hi.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

15:10.743 --> 15:12.904
<i>Katie, come on, sit down.</i>

15:12.978 --> 15:16.573
We went ahead
and ordered for you.
Thanks.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.777
You both look like
you're hiding back here.

15:21.453 --> 15:24.479
What's wrong?
What's going on?

15:24.556 --> 15:26.456
Oh, no.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.293
"Last night, Katie McBain charged
an unnamed assailant with rape.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.296
Sources indicate
the rapist is her boyfriend.''

15:32.364 --> 15:36.130
- It was their third date.
- Read that last paragraph.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.135
<i>"Miss McBain's neighbors</i>
<i>report that as a teenager...</i>

15:38.203 --> 15:42.697
she was in constant trouble
at home and at school.''

15:42.775 --> 15:45.471
You didn't do anything worse
than the rest of us.

15:45.544 --> 15:48.035
There's not one word about Kevin.
They crucified Katie.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.877
How in the hell could anybody
know what happened in our house?

15:52.051 --> 15:55.452
That's not the point.
The point is if they read it in here,

15:55.521 --> 15:58.957
then they think it's the truth.
They already do.

15:59.024 --> 16:03.984
<i>Oh, it's bad enough you had</i>
<i>to go through what you went through,</i>
<i>but this is humiliating.</i>

16:04.063 --> 16:05.997
Well, it's not gonna get any better.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.896
You want me to drop
the charges, don't you?

16:12.972 --> 16:16.567
I can't do that.
I'm only thinking of you.
Maybe it's in your best interest.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.702
How can it be in my best interest
to let a rapist go free?
All right, Katie.

16:19.778 --> 16:24.181
Calm down. We understand.
Everything's gonna be fine,just fine.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.418
We only want what's best for you.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.681
Then please,

16:29.755 --> 16:33.691
trust that by pressing charges,
I'm doing the right thing.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.353
We do think you're
doing the right thing.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.362
Don't we,Jim?

16:40.966 --> 16:43.059
Jim?

16:49.174 --> 16:51.165
- I have to go to the restroom.
- Want me to go with you?

16:51.243 --> 16:53.108
No, thank you. I can go by myself.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.550
Hi, Katie.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.552
Hello.
Uh, could we talk?

17:01.620 --> 17:03.884
- Talk about what?
- About Kevin.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.720
- He's really upset about this.
- Yeah, well, he should be.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.228
Look, Katie, I know you're angry about
him and Paula. But you knew they
were practically engaged, right?

17:10.295 --> 17:13.388
- Paula?
- <i>He really loves her.</i>
<i>You shouldn't do this just to get back at him.</i>

17:13.464 --> 17:16.025
- Get back at him for what?
- For getting engaged to Paula.

17:16.101 --> 17:19.263
- Is that what he told you?
- <i>He told us you and he got real friendly,</i>

17:19.338 --> 17:23.240
and afterwards when he told you
he was engaged to Paula-
You made this rape thing up.

17:24.476 --> 17:28.412
- I didn't make it up.
- Look.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.415
Kevin wouldn't rape you.
Everybody knows that, Katie.

17:31.483 --> 17:34.452
<i>Everybody.</i>

17:39.324 --> 17:43.158
What is wrong with these people?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.162
They don't believe you, Sam.

17:46.865 --> 17:49.595
Ziggy showed me a bunch
of newspaper stories,

17:49.668 --> 17:53.297
and they're all slanted
against the victim.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.602
It doesn't change the truth.

17:55.674 --> 18:00.043
- Well, what if it's not the truth?
- Oh, come on, Al. Katie was raped.
You know that.

18:00.112 --> 18:03.570
<i>I'm just saying that maybe</i>
<i>she wasn't raped by Kevin.</i>

18:06.118 --> 18:10.452
What?
<i>Ziggy says there's a 47% chance...</i>

18:10.522 --> 18:13.491
<i>that the rape occurred</i>
<i>after she left Kevin.</i>

18:13.559 --> 18:16.960
- What does Katie say?
- She says Kevin raped her.

18:17.029 --> 18:20.123
Well, I think that Katie is
telling the truth, don't you?

18:20.199 --> 18:22.963
Okay. Let me play
devil's advocate, okay?

18:23.035 --> 18:25.526
<i>Katie and Kevin go out to dinner.</i>

18:25.604 --> 18:31.440
They go to a restaurant.
They have a couple of glasses of wine,
and then they go for a drive.

18:31.510 --> 18:36.846
They go up to Fort Cronkite,
and they get into a little
romantic discussion.

18:36.915 --> 18:41.750
The discussion turns to kissing,
then pretty soon the kissing
gets passionate,

18:41.820 --> 18:45.813
and then the passion
gets into na, na, na, da, da, da,
you know?

18:45.891 --> 18:48.485
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so when they're done,

18:48.560 --> 18:53.520
then just say for some reason,
they get into an argument.
About what?

18:53.599 --> 18:57.433
I don't know, say,
uh, another woman.

18:57.503 --> 19:00.336
There's always another woman.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.396
Katie gets angry.

19:02.474 --> 19:06.467
She gets out of the car
and hitches a ride home.

19:06.545 --> 19:10.003
And gets picked up by strangers.
Hmm.

19:10.082 --> 19:12.016
Or it could just be one guy.

19:12.084 --> 19:16.418
He sees that she's tipsy.
He sees that she's hurt, she's alone.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.651
He takes advantage of her.
He rapes her, roughs her up,

19:19.725 --> 19:22.057
drops her at a hospital.

19:22.127 --> 19:24.857
Who's the guy? She doesn't know.
She never saw him before.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.764
But she's hurt and angry
and humiliated.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.997
So who's the only guy
she can take it out on?

19:32.070 --> 19:33.731
Kevin.
Bingo.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.898
Only it didn't happen that way.

19:37.809 --> 19:41.472
But you don't know that for sure.
Why would I have leaped in here?

19:41.547 --> 19:45.608
- I don't know. I don't know, sometimes-
- Katie was raped.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.279
And in my heart
I feel that Kevin did it.

19:49.354 --> 19:53.017
Now unless you or somebody else
can show me a reason
to believe differently,

19:53.091 --> 19:56.993
I'm going to do everything I can
to prove that Kevin is guilty.

19:59.998 --> 20:03.627
-<i>[ Al ] She doesn't believe you either.</i>
- <i>What do I need? A videotape</i>
<i>ofhim raping me? Is that it?</i>

20:03.702 --> 20:06.364
That would help.
Even if it wasn't admissible.

20:06.438 --> 20:10.568
How- How do you explain this,
what happened to me?

20:10.642 --> 20:14.203
You and Kevin got romantic
up there at Fort Cronkite.

20:14.279 --> 20:17.112
The next thing you know,
the sex turns rough.

20:17.182 --> 20:20.413
You get hurt, accidently.
Accidently?

20:20.485 --> 20:23.147
- I don't think I like this woman, Sam.
- You go to the hospital.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.487
You know your folks will find out,
so in order to cover your tracks,
you cry " rape.''

20:26.558 --> 20:29.083
Then the police come in
and you can't back down.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.129
You talk like I'm the one on trial here.
You are.

20:31.196 --> 20:33.562
But he's the rapist.
Not according to him,

20:33.632 --> 20:35.623
and probably not according to
most of the people in this town.

20:35.701 --> 20:38.761
And the jury will come from
the people in this town.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.634
She's afraid of losing, Sam.
I know that.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.334
What?
I know that you're afraid of losing.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.740
Hell, yes, I'm afraid of losing.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.473
Every time I put a rape victim on trial
and the rapist gets away with it,

20:48.547 --> 20:51.072
it just makes it easier
for the next one to get off.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.618
I don't want any of them to get off.

20:54.686 --> 20:57.246
- I think I'm getting to like this woman, Sam.
- But she doesn't believe me.

20:57.322 --> 21:02.316
My believing you doesn't have a damn
thing to do with my taking your case.

21:02.394 --> 21:04.328
Okay.

21:05.330 --> 21:09.289
You reported the rape
right away. That's good.

21:09.368 --> 21:13.771
But you knew Kevin,
however minimally. That's bad.

21:13.839 --> 21:19.175
You were injured.
Jury likes it when a woman's injured.

21:19.244 --> 21:22.042
But Kevin has no priors. That's bad.

21:24.783 --> 21:28.776
Katie, you will be treated as an object,

21:28.854 --> 21:32.346
like a piece of evidence,
as the offender.

21:32.424 --> 21:35.154
The defense will humiliate
and discredit you in any way they can.

21:36.395 --> 21:39.330
- Can you handle that?
- I think that's why I'm here.

21:39.398 --> 21:43.528
You lie to me, I'll drop your butt
so fast you won't know what hit you.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.467
Does that mean
you're gonna take the case?

21:50.142 --> 21:54.806
<i>Ed, put out a warrant for the arrest</i>
<i>of Kevin Wentworth on the McBain rape.</i>

21:54.880 --> 21:57.644
<i>I knew you couldn't</i>
<i>resist the underdog, Nancy.</i>

21:57.716 --> 22:00.184
Thanks, Ed.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.584
We're going to trial.
That's it. You did it, Sam.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.555
Looks like I'm through here.
<i>We'rejust getting started.</i>

22:06.558 --> 22:09.356
Oh, well, that's with the real Katie.
He's out-You're leaping out now.

22:09.428 --> 22:13.057
<i>Yeah, little lady, it looks like the next</i>
<i>stop for you is the witness stand.</i>

22:17.169 --> 22:19.467
Uh-oh.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.940
<i>[ Both ]</i>
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

22:39.991 --> 22:41.925
<i>[ Door Opens ]</i>

22:46.865 --> 22:50.130
Well?
Katie decided to prosecute.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.430
[ Sam's Voice ]
I'm sorry, um, I know
it's not gonna be easy.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.838
<i>[ Phone Ringing ]</i>
Don't answer that.

22:56.908 --> 22:59.001
Why not?

23:00.545 --> 23:03.639
Katie, please don't answer the phone.

23:03.715 --> 23:07.048
McBain residence.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.053
Mm-hmm.

23:14.192 --> 23:16.660
Some people have
a very sick sense of humor.

23:19.164 --> 23:23.191
This afternoon we got a call
from one of the deacons at church.

23:24.536 --> 23:29.303
They don't want you to teach
Sunday school anymore.

23:30.976 --> 23:32.967
What is wrong
with the people in this town?

23:33.044 --> 23:35.239
They're scared, Katie.
They're afraid.
Afraid of what?

23:35.313 --> 23:38.180
- They had a lot of calls from parents.
- That's not fair.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.184
The Wentworths are important.

23:40.252 --> 23:43.619
Especially in church now that
they've donated the new pipe organ.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.784
People are siding with them.

23:49.294 --> 23:52.263
I- Oh, I wish you'd never
gone to the police.

23:59.838 --> 24:03.672
- I'm-I'm going to fix dinner.
- I'll give you a hand, Mom.

24:08.713 --> 24:11.773
Sweetie, don't-don't be
too hard on your mom.

24:12.784 --> 24:16.117
She's a McBain by marriage,
not by birth.

24:16.188 --> 24:19.885
She doesn't have the Irish grit
that we have, Katie.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.986
You gonna make it okay?

24:25.063 --> 24:29.397
You bet.
Yeah, that's my girl.

24:33.071 --> 24:35.005
How's it going?

24:36.942 --> 24:39.376
Oh, great. Everything's just great.

24:41.713 --> 24:45.547
At least I got Katie's dad
to believe in me- in her.

24:45.617 --> 24:48.415
Well, maybe things are turning around.
Ziggy's got something interesting.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.650
It seems there's a girl
named Paula Fletcher,

24:51.723 --> 24:55.056
and the guy had a big fight with her
the same night that he raped Katie.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.788
Paula is his fiancée.
Oh.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.696
Well, then, you think maybe he raped
Katie because he was angry at Paula?

25:00.765 --> 25:03.700
Maybe it's worth asking the question.
But what else have you got?

25:03.768 --> 25:06.396
Just that there's a 90% chance
that you gotta testify.

25:06.471 --> 25:09.031
Testify? I can't testify, Al.

25:09.107 --> 25:12.099
I can't swear to tell the truth
when I don't know what the truth is.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.509
Katie and Kevin are the only
two people who know what happened,

25:14.579 --> 25:16.774
and I can't get inside her mind-

25:18.016 --> 25:20.849
You can.
I can?

25:20.919 --> 25:24.184
Yes, you can talk to Katie,
get her to tell you what happened.
Yeah, but after the rape,

25:24.256 --> 25:26.781
not to mention the leap,
this girl is catatonic.

25:26.858 --> 25:30.021
Dr. Beeks has been working with her,
but it's going to take some time
to ease her into this.

25:30.095 --> 25:33.758
I don't have time, Al.
The trial starts tomorrow.
Okay, look, there's something else too.

25:33.832 --> 25:37.324
It seems she started seeing
a psychiatrist two months
after she was raped.

25:37.402 --> 25:39.893
You think maybe she told
the psychiatrist what happened?
Well, wouldn't you?

25:40.906 --> 25:44.069
Anyway, I'm gonna go back
and see if I can't get into those files.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.474
Great.
Okay.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.479
Just hang in there, Sam, okay?

26:02.994 --> 26:07.158
You remember the time
I came over here in the fifth grade?

26:07.232 --> 26:10.724
No.
Well, it was a long time ago.

26:10.802 --> 26:12.736
What do you want?

26:12.804 --> 26:14.795
To give you this.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.571
It's from Shuler's.
Twenty-four karat gold.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.980
So what?
Take it.

26:24.049 --> 26:28.076
You can't buy
your way out of this, Kevin.
It's not a bribe, Katie.

26:28.153 --> 26:30.986
It's my way of saying I'm sorry.

26:31.056 --> 26:35.220
Sorry for raping me?
I-I didn't rape you.

26:35.293 --> 26:38.353
We may have gotten
a little out of control,
but I didn't rape you.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.421
The hell you didn't.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.102
Katie, they charged me.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.770
They took my fingerprints.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.434
They treated me like a criminal.
You are a criminal.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.842
They've subpoenaed Paula.
Why Paula? She didn't do anything.

26:54.913 --> 26:57.040
Except make you angry.
What?

26:57.115 --> 27:00.983
The night you raped me.
You had a fight with Paula.
I didn't rape you.

27:01.052 --> 27:04.488
S-So we had a fight. So what?
All couples have fights.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.650
You were furious with her.
Furious with all women,
I don't know what.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.660
But you took it out on me.

27:09.728 --> 27:12.458
You beat me
and you raped me because of it.

27:13.465 --> 27:17.060
<i>I object. This line of questioning</i>
<i>is totally irrelevant.</i>

27:17.135 --> 27:22.334
Your Honor, it's very relevant.
I'm establishing the defendant's
state of mind on the evening in question.

27:22.407 --> 27:27.344
- Overruled.
- <i>Paula, did you and Kevin</i>
<i>have a fight on the night in question?</i>

27:27.412 --> 27:30.848
- Yes.
- <i>Did he strike you during that argument?</i>

27:30.915 --> 27:33.509
- Objection.
- Your Honor,

27:33.585 --> 27:37.419
I believe what occurred a few hours
before the rape to be very relevant.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.320
Objection overruled.

27:40.425 --> 27:43.053
<i>Miss Fletcher,</i>
<i>was the argument violent?</i>

27:43.128 --> 27:45.221
<i>Kevin was very angry.</i>

27:45.296 --> 27:47.196
- Did he strike you?
- No.

27:48.199 --> 27:51.225
But he wanted to, didn't he?
<i>Your Honor.</i>

27:51.302 --> 27:53.497
<i>Sustained.</i>
No further questions.

27:53.571 --> 27:55.869
<i>Your witness, Mr. Chadwick.</i>

27:58.643 --> 28:01.373
How would you describe your
relationship with Mr. Wentworth?

28:02.414 --> 28:04.541
<i>As a normal, adult relationship.</i>

28:04.616 --> 28:08.450
<i>By that,you mean you were having</i>
<i>sexual relations with Mr. Wentworth?</i>

28:08.520 --> 28:10.454
We're going to be married.

28:10.522 --> 28:15.186
<i>Miss Fletcher,</i>
<i>if you don't mind my saying so,</i>
<i>you're a very attractive woman.</i>

28:15.260 --> 28:21.130
<i>The prosecution claims that</i>
<i>instead of making love to you,</i>
<i>Mr. Wentworth raped the plaintiff.</i>

28:21.199 --> 28:23.360
<i>Does that make sense to you?</i>

28:23.435 --> 28:26.097
- No.
- Doesn't make sense to me either.

28:29.774 --> 28:32.743
No further questions.
<i>You may step down.</i>

28:32.811 --> 28:34.779
The prosecution
may call its next witness.

28:34.846 --> 28:37.314
We call Kevin Wentworth.

28:37.382 --> 28:40.317
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

28:40.385 --> 28:42.615
- I do.
- You may be seated.

28:44.122 --> 28:47.751
Mr. Wentworth,
could you describe the events
on the evening ofJune 20?

28:47.826 --> 28:50.761
Well, Paula and I had this
argument early in the evening.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.797
A violent argument?
No.

28:52.864 --> 28:55.355
There's this guy she used to see
that's been calling her.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.663
I just wanted her
to stop talking to him.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.967
So you were jealous?
<i>I guess so.</i>

29:01.039 --> 29:03.269
That's why I called Katie
and asked her out to dinner.

29:03.341 --> 29:05.468
To make Paula jealous?

29:05.543 --> 29:07.636
Pretty stupid, huh?
<i>If it is, Your Honor,</i>

29:07.712 --> 29:09.612
every man in this courtroom's
been guilty of it.

29:09.681 --> 29:15.119
<i>Your Honor, I would like the learned council</i>
<i>for the defense to address his remarks</i>
<i>to the court and not the audience.</i>

29:16.187 --> 29:18.587
- You're warned, Mr. Chadwick.
- So noted, Your Honor.

29:18.656 --> 29:22.285
- What happened next, Mr. Wentworth?
- <i>Katie and I had a lot of fun at dinner.</i>

29:22.360 --> 29:24.760
So I asked if she wanted to go for a drive.

29:24.829 --> 29:27.662
She said " Okay'' and
we went to Fort Cronkite.

29:27.732 --> 29:30.895
I parked the car
and turned on the radio.

29:30.969 --> 29:35.929
I remember " Lady'' by Lionel Richie
was playing, and we started making out.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.934
It got pretty serious, and I could tell
she was getting really heated up,

29:41.012 --> 29:43.674
and then things got a little out of hand.

29:43.748 --> 29:46.148
Out of hand?
<i>Yeah. I'm only human,</i>

29:46.217 --> 29:49.380
So I did it. I mean, we did it.

29:50.722 --> 29:53.714
<i>Then afterwards, she said</i>
<i>she didn't want me seeing anybody else.</i>

29:53.792 --> 29:56.955
I felt bad because I was
almost engaged to Paula.

29:57.028 --> 30:00.191
I wanted to be honest with her,
so I told her the truth,

30:00.265 --> 30:04.702
that it was serious between me and Paula
and that I couldn't see her, Katie, again.

30:04.769 --> 30:08.466
So you didn't want to see her again,
and yet you had sex with her?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.508
Like I said, I'm only human.

30:10.575 --> 30:12.543
Well, that depends
on your definition of human.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.578
Objection.
<i>Sustained.</i>

30:14.646 --> 30:18.912
So what happened next?
After you did what was only human?

30:18.983 --> 30:21.508
Katie got really mad and
ran from the car and tripped.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.679
<i>That's when she hurt herself.</i>

30:23.755 --> 30:26.417
-<i>She hurt herself in a fall?</i>
- <i>That's right.</i>

30:26.491 --> 30:29.255
<i>Your Honor, I would like to enter</i>
<i>into evidence as Exhibit "A ''...</i>

30:29.327 --> 30:34.026
these photos taken of Miss McBain
one hour after the incident.

30:34.098 --> 30:36.089
So noted.

30:40.772 --> 30:44.731
- <i>How does a fall cause this kind of damage?</i>
- I don't know. It did.

30:44.809 --> 30:47.039
Did it cause the vaginal tears
Dr. Markoff found on Miss McBain?

30:47.111 --> 30:50.205
- I object.
- I didn't rape her.
- Sustained.

30:51.983 --> 30:55.976
No further questions.
<i>Mr. Chadwick,your witness.</i>

30:58.323 --> 31:01.451
I bet you're pretty confused
by this whole situation,
aren't you, Kevin?

31:01.526 --> 31:04.188
Yes. I mean, I take a girl out
on a dinner date,

31:04.262 --> 31:06.355
and the next thing I know,
I'm on trial for rape.

31:06.431 --> 31:09.958
<i>Was this the first time you and</i>
<i>Miss McBain had sexual relations?</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:13.401
<i>No. We had sex on the first</i>
<i>and the second date.</i>

31:13.471 --> 31:16.235
<i>Objection.!</i>
<i>I object, Your Honor.</i>

31:16.307 --> 31:19.299
- Move to strike.
- Order. Order.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.436
- Is this true?
- I, uh-

31:21.512 --> 31:24.413
- I'm checking.
- <i>Order or I will clear this courtroom.</i>

31:24.482 --> 31:28.578
- Well?
- According to her files, she never
said anything about it to her shrink.

31:28.653 --> 31:31.486
- I don't think so.
- You don't think?

31:31.556 --> 31:36.118
Your Honor, it is totally irrelevant
whether Miss McBain had sexual relations
prior to the night in question.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.287
<i>Your Honor, I'm trying to establish...</i>

31:38.363 --> 31:44.199
that since my client had
Miss McBain's consent to sexual relations
prior to the evening in question,

31:44.269 --> 31:47.136
<i>he believed, in good faith,</i>
<i>that he had consent again.</i>

31:47.205 --> 31:50.106
<i>I'll let the record stand.</i>
<i>Objection overruled.</i>

31:50.174 --> 31:53.109
- This is not working out.
- I'm doing the best I can.

31:53.177 --> 31:56.340
- I warned you, Katie.
- We have no further questions,
Your Honor.

31:56.414 --> 32:00.316
You may step down.
The state may call its next witness.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.681
We call Katie McBain.

32:15.199 --> 32:19.363
What are we gonna do here, Al?
I can't testify.
Oh, well, we've gotta stall for time.

32:19.437 --> 32:22.429
Raise your right hand.
Al.

32:22.507 --> 32:25.704
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth, and nothing</i>
<i>but the truth, so help you God?</i>

32:25.777 --> 32:27.802
Swoon.
Huh?

32:27.879 --> 32:29.369
Swoon.
What?

32:29.447 --> 32:31.711
Faint, pass out, take a dive.
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

32:31.783 --> 32:34.149
nothing but the truth,

Wilt.

32:34.218 --> 32:36.413
<i>[ Crowd Gasps ]</i>

32:40.591 --> 32:42.786
[ Murmuring ]
Take her into my chambers.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.795
That was a good swoon.
<i>This court stands adjourned</i>
<i>until 9:00 tomorrow.</i>

32:45.863 --> 32:47.797
I even believed that one.

33:01.379 --> 33:04.348
- No fever.
- It must be the stress.

33:05.350 --> 33:08.808
- Would you like some milk and cookies?
- Milk and cookies?

33:10.989 --> 33:15.551
[ Sighs ]
I-I don't know what else to do.

33:15.626 --> 33:20.256
I, uh, never thought I'd have to
deal with anything like this.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.265
Neither did I.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.563
<i>I wish I could be like one</i>
<i>of those moms on TV.</i>

33:24.635 --> 33:26.626
Say the right thing.
Make everything better.

33:26.704 --> 33:30.435
But, Katie, I'm very-
I'm confused, honey.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.999
It's a very confusing time.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.214
But you know that I love you,
and I would do-

33:43.287 --> 33:46.415
Oh, I would do anything
to take your pain away.

33:49.594 --> 33:51.858
I love you too, Mom.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.660
I'll tell you what.
What?

33:56.667 --> 34:00.763
All of a sudden I have this
big yearning for milk and cookies.

34:00.838 --> 34:03.830
[ Chuckling ]
You got it.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.235
Just give me a minute to bake them.

34:08.312 --> 34:10.906
Bake them?

34:10.982 --> 34:13.882
<i>Moms are too much, aren't they?</i>

34:19.290 --> 34:23.784
Al, I think I figured out
the solution to the problem.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.987
Well, then you're doing
better than me and Ziggy.

34:26.063 --> 34:29.556
Who's the one person who can tell us
the truth about what happened that night?

34:29.634 --> 34:33.570
Katie.
Right. So we bring her in to testify.

34:33.638 --> 34:37.301
Aha. How can we do that?
She's in the waiting room.

34:37.375 --> 34:40.742
Wait a second.
What if she's in the imaging chamber?

34:40.812 --> 34:42.746
And touching me.
Then I can see her.

34:42.813 --> 34:47.080
Yeah, but you couldn't hear her.
And your lip reading is terrible-

34:47.150 --> 34:50.085
Oh, I could repeat
everything she says.

34:50.154 --> 34:54.250
No, no, no, that would take too long.
You have to figure out a way
for me to hear her.

34:54.324 --> 34:58.625
How?
Well, I haven't figured that out.
That's for you and Ziggy to work out.

34:58.696 --> 35:00.823
In 1 2 hours?
Oh, come on. 1 2 hours.

35:00.898 --> 35:03.264
What's 1 2 hours?
You and Ziggy together. Come on.

35:03.334 --> 35:07.134
What makes you so sure?
It's all the time I got.

<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>After a sleepless night,</i>
<i>I had come to only one conclusion:</i>

<i>That hope is a fragile thing.</i>

<i>Without Katie's testimony</i>
<i>there was nothing I could do.</i>

35:26.023 --> 35:30.050
<i>So I could only wait and</i>
<i>hope that somehow, someway,</i>

<i>Al and Ziggy would come through.</i>

Of course it took enough power
to light up St. Louis for a month,
but we did it.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.876
- Miss McBain,
you don't feel faint again, do you?
- No, sir, Your Honor. I'm-I'm just fine.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.937
Say, " I do.''
I do.

36:57.014 --> 36:58.948

Get ready.Just relax.

Miss McBain,

did you go out on a date
with Kevin Wentworth

37:13.464 --> 37:15.398
Yes.
Yes.

He asked me to go
to dinner that night.
He asked me to go to dinner that night.

Did you accept?

Yes.
Yes.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.267
Could you please tell the court
what happened on that dinner date?

After dinner, he asked me to go for a drive.

<i>And what happened there?</i>

37:59.944 --> 38:03.641
[ Katie's Voice Only ]
He parked the car
and started to kiss me.

38:03.714 --> 38:06.410
<i>Did you kiss him back?</i>

38:06.484 --> 38:12.150
At first. But then he started
to get carried away and I stopped.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.350
<i>Carried away?</i>

38:14.425 --> 38:17.087
He tried to put his hand up my dress.

38:18.596 --> 38:21.087
<i>Go on.</i>

38:21.165 --> 38:24.965
I told him I wasn't like that.
That I was a nice girl.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.800
<i>What did he say?</i>

38:27.872 --> 38:32.866
He said the only difference
between nice girls and bad girls
is that bad girls help you.

38:34.245 --> 38:39.478
The he started kissing
and groping me again,
and I started to cry.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.586
<i>How did he respond to your tears?</i>

38:43.654 --> 38:49.115
He slapped me.
And I think I screamed.

38:49.193 --> 38:53.527
Because then he hit me
and pinned my arms behind me.

38:53.597 --> 38:55.861
<i>Did he slap you or hit you?</i>
<i>You said both.</i>

38:56.867 --> 39:00.530
He slapped me first,
and then hit me with his fist.

<i>How many times</i>
<i>did he hit you with his fist?</i>

39:05.042 --> 39:07.567
Three or four times.

39:07.645 --> 39:09.613
<i>Did he knock you unconscious?</i>

39:11.282 --> 39:15.343
I was kind of fuzzy for a while,
but I don't think I lost consciousness.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.454
<i>And then what happened?</i>

39:24.562 --> 39:27.656
Then-Then he raped me.

<i>Did you resist him?</i>

Not after he hit me.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.440
<i>Why not?</i>

39:43.647 --> 39:49.586
Because I was afraid he would kill me.

<i>How did you escape?</i>

39:54.658 --> 39:56.853

he got off me and
I opened the door and I ran.

That's it, folks. Thanks.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.248
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Over here, please.</i>

40:59.323 --> 41:01.791
Come on. Haven't you done enough?
Leave us alone.

41:01.859 --> 41:05.795
<i>That's enough.</i>
<i>No more pictures.</i>
<i>Come on, get back.</i>

41:05.863 --> 41:10.027
Come on. Come on, step back.
Back, back, back.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.432
So that's it?
Kevin just goes free?

41:12.503 --> 41:14.994
You can't try a man twice.

41:15.072 --> 41:18.906
I'm sorry. After your testimony,
I was sure they'd convict him.

41:18.976 --> 41:23.072
You have to forget this, Katie.
We'll-We'll go somewhere
where no one knows us.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.742
I'm not running away.
I've done nothing to be ashamed of.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.513
Your mom's right about
putting it behind you, Katie.
How?

41:29.587 --> 41:32.385
How am I supposed to forget
everything that's happened?

41:32.456 --> 41:36.153
I'm not just talking about the rape.
I'm talking about everything that's
happened to me since then.

41:37.828 --> 41:40.524
I forgot by becoming
a prosecuting attorney.

41:41.532 --> 41:44.729
- You were raped?
- Twelve years ago.

41:44.802 --> 41:49.569
- The guy was never convicted.
- That's why I try to only take rape cases
I think I can win.

41:51.242 --> 41:55.679
See, when I lose,
I go through it all again.

41:55.746 --> 41:57.680
I'm sorry.

42:00.918 --> 42:03.045
Come on, honey.

42:07.491 --> 42:09.721
Thank you for trying.
Yeah.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.756
Thank you. Let's go home.

42:14.832 --> 42:17.392
Katie, I'm sorry.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.062
Katie, I'm sorry I even
pressed you to go after him.

42:20.137 --> 42:22.071
You did the right thing.

42:23.574 --> 42:26.134
Besides,

42:26.210 --> 42:30.374
I'm still here,
so it must not be over yet.

42:52.036 --> 42:56.234
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Ziggy's got nothing. No explanation.</i>

42:58.042 --> 43:02.979
If I didn't leap in here to convict Kevin,
then what am I doing here?

43:04.682 --> 43:07.173
I don't know.
In the original history,

43:07.251 --> 43:12.314
Katie left town a week after
the rape and she never came back,
not even when her dad died in '88.

43:12.389 --> 43:16.485
So that's what I'm here for?
To keep Katie in town?

43:16.560 --> 43:20.428
I don't know.
It's as good an explanation as any.

43:20.497 --> 43:22.863
Talking to yourself, Katie?

43:22.933 --> 43:24.924
You slimeball.

43:25.002 --> 43:28.130
You shouldn't have done it.
You shouldn't have put me through it, Katie.

43:28.205 --> 43:32.505
Put <i>you</i> through it?
You should've known
they'd believe me.

43:32.576 --> 43:38.105
"I take a girl out for dinner
and the next thing I know,
I'm on trial for rape.''

43:47.524 --> 43:49.515
Sam, get up and hit this pimple!

43:49.593 --> 43:53.495
If you think that was rape,
wait till you feel what
I'm gonna do to you now.

43:53.564 --> 43:56.658
Sam, do something!

43:57.768 --> 44:00.635
That'll work.

44:00.704 --> 44:02.638
I think I know-

44:03.774 --> 44:05.708
I think I know why I'm here, Al.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.517
So things got a little
out of control, huh?

44:23.594 --> 44:26.154
So you slapped her.

44:26.230 --> 44:29.996
But that wasn't enough,
so you had to hit her.

44:30.067 --> 44:33.230
And then you hit her again.
[ Yells ]

44:34.571 --> 44:37.233
You son of a bitch.

44:52.589 --> 44:54.523
Katie?

45:00.431 --> 45:03.696
- Call the police.
- Oh, my God.

45:03.767 --> 45:05.826
Sweetie, what happened?

45:06.837 --> 45:10.534
He tried to do it again,
only this time I wasn't
pinned inside of a car.

45:12.376 --> 45:15.038
You did that yourself?

45:17.181 --> 45:22.448
Don't act so surprised, Dad.
I mean, after all, I am a McBain.

45:37.501 --> 45:42.871
<i>[ Man On Radio ]</i>
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

45:42.940 --> 45:46.307
<i>seven, six,</i>

45:46.376 --> 45:49.743
<i>five, four</i>-
Wait a second.

45:49.813 --> 45:52.077
<i>three, tw0-</i>
No, I can't do this!

45:52.149 --> 45:54.640
No!

45:54.718 --> 45:58.449
<i>We have ignition.</i>
<i>We have liftoff.</i>
