00:06.450 --> 00:09.410
Simon Walton? Single stab wound
to the chest, no DNA.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.770
No witnesses. No motive.

00:11.770 --> 00:15.410
Have you noticed
anything up with Lucy recently?

00:15.410 --> 00:17.410
She's hiding things.

00:17.410 --> 00:19.090
Lying.

00:19.090 --> 00:21.930
You know the worldly aren't supposed
to mourn with us.

00:21.930 --> 00:23.410
I think he would've wanted me here.

00:23.410 --> 00:25.770
He deserved some peace
for his final days.

00:25.770 --> 00:28.610
God knows you've...
given neither of us that.

00:28.610 --> 00:30.610
Boss, your mum rang.
Her neighbour's daughter,

00:30.610 --> 00:33.410
Rosa Shapland, hasn't been seen
since this morning.

00:33.410 --> 00:37.930
'My name's Rosa.
I need to get home. He's coming.'

00:37.930 --> 00:39.410
So it's an abduction.

01:05.770 --> 01:07.410
What time is it?

01:09.410 --> 01:12.250
It's five thirty.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.410
Sorry.

01:14.410 --> 01:16.450
Is there any news?
None.

01:21.610 --> 01:24.410
Go back to sleep.
Mm.

01:43.410 --> 01:46.410
Oh, you're... You're up.
I said you would be.

01:47.450 --> 01:50.410
I was cleaning her room.

01:51.410 --> 01:54.410
I found this,
hidden down the side of her bed.

01:54.410 --> 01:56.610
It's not from any of the family.

01:56.610 --> 01:58.410
We thought it might be important.

02:00.410 --> 02:01.410
It might be.

02:04.410 --> 02:06.410
Is there any progress?

02:06.410 --> 02:08.410
Er, we started house-to-house
enquiries last night.

02:08.410 --> 02:12.410
We can't pinpoint exactly where
she made the 999 call from, but...

02:12.410 --> 02:14.410
the mobile phone masts
give us a search area.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.410
We'll find her.

02:19.410 --> 02:21.410
We will.

02:25.410 --> 02:29.410
You've got work to do, so...
Come on, Ruth.

03:06.410 --> 03:09.410
Rosa Shapland.
Volunteers at the Woodyard.

03:09.410 --> 03:12.410
Was last seen there yesterday
at noon.

03:12.410 --> 03:15.410
We believe she made a 999 call
last night for help.

03:15.410 --> 03:18.410
The phone was switched off, so
we couldn't get a precise location,

03:18.410 --> 03:21.930
but we've pinged it and established
a search area around Saunton Sands.

03:21.930 --> 03:25.410
Rosa is 19, but she's lived
an extremely sheltered life.

03:25.410 --> 03:28.410
Very little contact
with anyone outside of her church.

03:28.410 --> 03:30.410
Her mother...

03:30.410 --> 03:32.410
found this...

03:32.410 --> 03:34.090
hidden in her bedroom.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.410
It's very unlikely
that Rosa bought this herself.

03:36.410 --> 03:39.410
So we need to get the necklace
to forensics ASAP. Sir.

03:39.410 --> 03:43.410
We do know that Rosa had contact
with Simon Walden

03:43.410 --> 03:45.410
in the weeks
leading up to his death.

03:45.410 --> 03:47.410
He attended her church...

03:48.410 --> 03:49.770
..and they spent time together
alone.

03:49.770 --> 03:51.410
Walden's mobile provider
has confirmed

03:51.410 --> 03:53.410
that he and Rosa exchanged
a number of texts

03:53.410 --> 03:56.410
in the days leading up to his death.
Without the physical phones,

03:56.410 --> 03:58.410
we don't know the content
of these messages.

03:58.410 --> 04:01.410
But it does appear
that Simon Walden's murder

04:01.410 --> 04:05.410
and Rosa's disappearance...
are linked.

04:05.410 --> 04:07.410
So we're looking at
the same perpetrator, Sir?

04:07.410 --> 04:09.410
That's what we need to find out.

04:09.410 --> 04:12.410
Until we have evidence
to the contrary,

04:12.410 --> 04:14.410
we operate on the basis
that she's still alive,

04:14.410 --> 04:15.770
maybe being held somewhere.

04:15.770 --> 04:17.610
She's been missing for 18 hours.

04:17.610 --> 04:20.410
There's still a very good chance
we could get her home safely.

04:20.410 --> 04:23.410
DC Pritchard, I want you
to take a team on house-to-house

04:23.410 --> 04:24.410
in the Saunton Sands area.

04:24.410 --> 04:29.410
Sir, the other numbers
that Walden received messages from,

04:29.410 --> 04:32.410
one of them is a colleague of his
at the Woodyard, another chef.

04:32.410 --> 04:34.410
Name's, erm, William Strensham.

04:34.410 --> 04:36.410
Will Strensham?

04:39.410 --> 04:41.410
What was he like? At school?

04:41.410 --> 04:44.410
Always picked first in PE,
captain of every team.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.410
Girls used to literally
fight over him.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.410
Sounds like a knob.

04:49.930 --> 04:54.410
You know, thing about guys like that
is that school was the pinnacle.

04:54.410 --> 04:56.410
It's all been downhill since then.

04:56.410 --> 05:00.410
Unlike us losers.

05:02.410 --> 05:03.610
I've been looking out for you.

05:03.610 --> 05:05.410
You know, what with Jonathan
and everything.

05:05.410 --> 05:07.410
I didn't know
you knew I was living back here.

05:07.410 --> 05:10.250
Oh, yeah,
you're big news round here.

05:10.250 --> 05:13.090
I mean, to be fair,
there's not much competition, so...

05:13.090 --> 05:14.410
Right.

05:18.410 --> 05:20.410
Look, you don't have to pretend
this is a social call, Matt.

05:20.410 --> 05:23.410
I guess you're here
to talk about Simon.

05:24.410 --> 05:25.410
Yeah.

05:26.610 --> 05:31.410
I need you to tell me about
the text messages you exchanged.

05:32.410 --> 05:36.450
I'm in debt. And Simon,
well, he offered to bail me out.

05:36.450 --> 05:40.410
He said he had this cash
that he hadn't got any need of.

05:40.410 --> 05:42.930
It was like he was making excuses
to get rid of it or something.

05:42.930 --> 05:46.250
Only, a few days later, he said he
couldn't give me the cash after all.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.410
Something else he needed
the money for or something, so...

05:50.410 --> 05:52.450
Did he say what?
No.

05:55.410 --> 05:58.410
Did he ever mention
a girl called Rosa?

05:58.410 --> 06:00.410
Another volunteer here?
No.

06:00.410 --> 06:03.090
But I did see him talking to the
girls at the day centre sometimes.

06:04.410 --> 06:06.410
Seemed a bit... weird.

06:11.410 --> 06:14.090
Sir.

06:14.090 --> 06:16.410
A woman on Harebell Lane says
she saw a light on

06:16.410 --> 06:18.250
at a neighbouring property
last night.

06:18.250 --> 06:21.410
She thinks she saw a man with
a woman matching Rosa's description.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.930
Becky, you better call it in.

06:58.410 --> 07:01.410
I hear that you're friendly
with Rosa, is that right?

07:01.410 --> 07:03.410
I'm friends with everybody here.

07:05.410 --> 07:08.610
And, erm, what about Simon and Rosa,
were they friends?

07:11.250 --> 07:13.410
Did you ever see them together?

07:13.410 --> 07:15.410
Talking? Meeting up?

07:19.410 --> 07:23.610
We know that Simon had been
to one of Rosa's church meetings.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.410
Do you know anything about that?
No.

07:26.410 --> 07:29.090
Rosa had texted Simon.

07:30.410 --> 07:31.410
Any idea why?

07:35.410 --> 07:39.410
Were they more than just friends,
Lucy?

07:42.610 --> 07:44.410
'She knows more than she's saying.'

07:44.410 --> 07:46.410
'Scared of getting in trouble
if she tells us?'

07:46.410 --> 07:48.410
She ain't scared.

07:49.410 --> 07:51.410
Let's say Rosa and Walden
were involved in some way.

07:51.410 --> 07:54.250
A friendship or something more.
Mm.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.410
Is it possible they were together
at the time of his murder,

07:56.410 --> 07:58.450
that Rosa witnessed the attack?

07:59.930 --> 08:02.410
What, and then the killer took her
to silence her?

08:02.410 --> 08:05.410
Mm... Why wait two days?

08:06.410 --> 08:08.410
Ross?
You better come over here.

08:42.410 --> 08:44.770
Any sign of a body being moved?
Not that I can see.

08:44.770 --> 08:46.410
When will we know if it's Rosa's?

08:46.410 --> 08:49.450
Blood type in an hour,
full DNA tomorrow morning.

08:49.450 --> 08:51.410
OK.

08:58.410 --> 09:00.410
Whoever it was broke in
and held Rosa here.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.610
Why this place?

09:04.610 --> 09:07.410
Opportunism? Hmm...

09:07.410 --> 09:09.450
A place to hold her.

09:09.450 --> 09:12.090
Why all the mess?

09:12.090 --> 09:13.410
Result of an attack?

09:15.410 --> 09:18.410
Looks more like someone was
searching for something.

09:18.410 --> 09:21.250
Have we tracked down the owners?
Yeah, we're on it.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.410
Apparently, they live abroad
and rent this place out.

09:23.410 --> 09:26.610
The neighbour doesn't think
there's been any guests recently.

09:26.610 --> 09:28.410
But she noticed the light on.

09:28.410 --> 09:31.410
Yeah, more than once
in the last few weeks.

09:31.410 --> 09:33.410
Assumed it was a cleaner.

09:33.410 --> 09:36.410
But there was no sign of a break-in
48 hours ago? No.

09:37.410 --> 09:42.410
Milk, a week out of date.
Someone's been using this place.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.410
That person must have had a key.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.410
Let's step up the house-to-house.

09:46.410 --> 09:48.410
See if anyone else has witnessed
movement in the last few weeks,

09:48.410 --> 09:51.250
or anything else
in the early hours of this morning.

09:55.930 --> 09:57.450
Sir?

09:57.450 --> 10:00.410
This laptop was hidden
in the loft space.

10:00.410 --> 10:02.090
Locked with a password.

10:02.090 --> 10:05.410
Let's get it onto tech.
There's this as well.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.930
A Bible with "Simon Walden"
inscribed in it.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.410
Ruth's in pieces, Matthew.

10:14.410 --> 10:18.410
We all are.
Please find our girl.

10:20.090 --> 10:21.410
We will.

10:21.410 --> 10:24.610
Do you think her disappearance
is linked to this murder?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.250
Er, we don't know yet.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.610
We didn't even realise
it was him that'd been killed

10:30.610 --> 10:32.930
till we saw his photo in the paper.

10:34.930 --> 10:37.410
And when he came here to the church,
did you talk to him?

10:37.410 --> 10:39.410
A bit.

10:39.410 --> 10:43.410
You could tell he was troubled...
Smell the booze on him.

10:44.410 --> 10:48.410
Er, we found this... in his things.
Oh.

10:49.410 --> 10:51.410
Yeah, I gave him that.

10:51.410 --> 10:53.410
Told him
to come back to the next meeting.

10:54.410 --> 10:55.410
Never did.

11:03.770 --> 11:05.410
I remember doing this
when I was a kid.

11:07.410 --> 11:11.410
Not just homeless now.
Other families need help, too.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.410
They need God's word, too.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.410
Well, I'd expect they'd rather
an extra tin of beans.

11:31.410 --> 11:32.450
When people are suffering,

11:32.450 --> 11:35.930
they start looking for
a different way.

11:35.930 --> 11:40.410
We try to show it to them.
A simpler, kinder life.

11:40.410 --> 11:44.410
Less about buying things
and looking at screens. And...

11:44.410 --> 11:46.410
more about helping people.

11:52.410 --> 11:56.410
I know you think it's all hellfire
and damnation.

11:58.410 --> 12:02.250
No.
I remember the kindness.

12:05.410 --> 12:07.410
I remember the judgement, too.

12:14.410 --> 12:16.770
I know what you saw this morning.

12:16.770 --> 12:20.090
Please, Matthew, no.

12:20.090 --> 12:21.410
I refuse to feel ashamed.

12:22.770 --> 12:24.410
I know you do.

12:24.410 --> 12:28.410
And I know it's been easier...
to pretend I don't exist.

12:33.610 --> 12:35.610
Is... that what you think?

12:36.610 --> 12:39.410
Well, it's true, isn't it?

12:39.410 --> 12:40.770
Better no son than a...

12:42.410 --> 12:45.410
..than a gay one.

12:46.410 --> 12:47.450
Mm.

13:10.410 --> 13:11.410
So, it's Rosa's blood type.

13:11.410 --> 13:14.770
Fingerprints place Rosa
and Walden there.

13:14.770 --> 13:17.410
No CCTV in the area?
Nothing.

13:17.410 --> 13:19.410
Still waiting on the owners.

13:19.410 --> 13:22.410
Postie says he's seen a man
and a woman a few times recently...

13:22.410 --> 13:24.410
matching Walden's description,
but not Rosa's.

13:24.410 --> 13:29.410
So... we know Rosa and Walden
texted each other,

13:29.410 --> 13:31.410
we know they spent time together.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.250
We know they both spent time
at the chalet,

13:33.250 --> 13:34.770
but we don't know
if it was together.

13:34.770 --> 13:38.410
It does seem likely
that whoever abducted Rosa

13:38.410 --> 13:40.410
knew about Simon's
use of this place, so...

13:42.410 --> 13:43.930
Possibilities.

13:45.410 --> 13:47.410
Something's going on
between Walden and Rosa.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.410
She witnessed the murder
and was abducted to silence her.

13:52.410 --> 13:54.410
Priority
is unlocking Walden's laptop.

13:54.410 --> 13:58.250
And finding out how and why
he had use of this place.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.410
If we understand that,
we might make some sense of this.

14:01.410 --> 14:02.410
I'll get on it.

14:14.410 --> 14:16.410
Do you think she's still alive, Sir?

14:17.410 --> 14:20.090
Yeah, we'll proceed
on the basis she is.

14:34.410 --> 14:37.410
You been up all night?
Working.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.410
Thought you probably hadn't eaten.

14:40.410 --> 14:43.410
Guilt cake? What've you done?

14:43.410 --> 14:46.410
I need to talk to you about Ed.

14:46.410 --> 14:48.410
You've cheated on him.

14:49.450 --> 14:51.410
I've asked him to move in.

14:52.410 --> 14:54.250
Congratulations.

14:54.250 --> 14:56.410
I mean, obviously,
he'll be paying his own share...

14:56.410 --> 14:57.770
It'll just be like
having another lodger.

14:57.770 --> 14:59.410
Right, yeah.

14:59.410 --> 15:02.410
I'm so pleased for you. Come here.

15:42.410 --> 15:44.410
I'll bring some more stuff round
tonight.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.410
How much more is there?!

15:46.410 --> 15:49.410
All right, it's not too late
to change your mind.

15:49.410 --> 15:52.090
Actually, it is.
I've handed in notice on my flat,

15:52.090 --> 15:53.410
so you're stuck with me.

15:55.770 --> 15:57.410
Good.

16:19.410 --> 16:23.410
Dad.
On at me to meet for a drink.

16:23.410 --> 16:25.410
He wants to talk.

16:25.410 --> 16:28.410
Oh. What a total bastard.

16:30.410 --> 16:32.410
I just can't deal with him
at the moment.

16:32.410 --> 16:34.410
Why?

16:38.410 --> 16:42.410
I don't know. This...
Simon stuff.

16:42.410 --> 16:43.410
The police.

16:45.410 --> 16:47.250
Bad memories, I guess.

16:48.410 --> 16:49.930
Of the accident?

16:55.410 --> 16:57.410
You know
you don't have to hide your scars.

16:57.410 --> 17:00.410
I know he just wants to help, but...
Well, then, let him help.

17:02.090 --> 17:04.410
I'm serious, you're lucky.

17:05.410 --> 17:07.410
My dad panics
when my mum leaves the room,

17:07.410 --> 17:09.410
in case he has to talk to me.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.410
Just... call him back.

17:25.930 --> 17:27.410
This is nice, innit?

17:29.090 --> 17:31.410
Could never have done this
in London, could we?

17:34.410 --> 17:37.410
I know I've been working a lot
recently.

17:37.410 --> 17:41.090
I know we haven't checked in
with each other... for a while.

17:41.090 --> 17:42.410
Like, five days.

17:45.410 --> 17:46.410
This is nice, though, yeah.

17:52.610 --> 17:55.410
Made the right decision coming here,
didn't we?

17:55.410 --> 17:57.410
Away from your dad.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.090
How's school?

18:04.410 --> 18:06.410
And by that, I mean,
is there anybody nice?

18:08.410 --> 18:10.450
There is one.
Mm?

18:10.450 --> 18:14.410
Asked me out.
And?

18:14.410 --> 18:16.410
Told him I was too busy with exams.

18:18.410 --> 18:20.410
Oh...

18:20.410 --> 18:22.410
I think there must have been
a mix-up at the hospital

18:22.410 --> 18:24.410
when you were born.

18:25.450 --> 18:28.410
Mm!

18:28.410 --> 18:30.090
Sorry, love.

18:32.410 --> 18:34.410
Ross. 'Hey.
Got hold of the chalet owners.'

18:35.410 --> 18:38.410
According to them, the only people
with a set of keys are a local pub.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.410
'Their staff do a load of cleaning
for some holiday lets.'

18:42.410 --> 18:44.090
You'll never guess which pub.

18:50.410 --> 18:51.410
Hi.

18:51.410 --> 18:54.410
You and the staff here
clean holiday lets, is that right?

18:54.410 --> 18:56.410
Yeah.

18:56.410 --> 18:58.410
Well, can I have a look
at the rotas?

19:01.410 --> 19:03.090
Wasn't expecting to see you again.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.410
Yeah, me neither.
Did you get my text?

19:06.410 --> 19:09.410
I thought maybe
I got the number wrong.

19:12.090 --> 19:14.410
No, you didn't.
Erm, I'm gonna need you

19:14.410 --> 19:17.410
to just never mention
the other night ever again.

19:17.410 --> 19:20.610
This isn't like some negging thing
to keep you interested.

19:20.610 --> 19:23.090
I-I mean, literally,
wipe it from your mind forever.

19:24.410 --> 19:25.410
OK.

19:25.410 --> 19:28.410
Are these the names of the people
that had access?

19:28.410 --> 19:30.250
Are they staff here?

19:30.250 --> 19:32.410
It's me, and two girls
that work in the kitchen.

19:32.410 --> 19:35.410
And there was a mate of theirs
that lives down the street,

19:35.410 --> 19:37.610
but she got sacked.
Is this her?

19:37.610 --> 19:40.450
Yeah. Gaby Chadwell.

19:53.410 --> 19:55.410
I gave Simon a key, yeah.

19:55.410 --> 19:58.410
So you were in a relationship.
I wouldn't call it a relationship.

19:58.410 --> 20:00.930
Whatever it was,
you concealed it from us.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.410
And that's a potential crime.

20:05.410 --> 20:06.610
When did it start?

20:08.410 --> 20:09.930
A few months ago.

20:11.250 --> 20:14.770
Nothing happened at Hope Street.
We hardly spoke.

20:14.770 --> 20:18.410
So, you met up at the holiday let?
I'd been sacked by then.

20:18.410 --> 20:22.410
I was the shittest cleaner ever,
I just... wiped around stuff.

20:22.410 --> 20:23.450
But I still had a key.

20:25.410 --> 20:27.410
Got one copied and gave it to Simon.

20:27.410 --> 20:30.410
Just told him to meet me there
that night.

20:30.410 --> 20:33.410
So you met there for sex.
That was the plan.

20:33.410 --> 20:35.410
When I arrived, he'd cooked.

20:36.410 --> 20:39.410
And we stayed up all night,
talking about childhoods.

20:41.410 --> 20:43.410
We saw flowers there.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.410
Food in the fridge.

20:45.410 --> 20:49.410
We started meeting there most days,
just for an hour or two.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.090
Once, we had a whole night.

20:53.090 --> 20:57.410
The owners wanna press charges
for trespassing and theft.

20:57.410 --> 20:59.410
I guess you've seen my record
already.

20:59.410 --> 21:03.410
Proud history of shoplifting
and petty fraud.

21:04.410 --> 21:06.610
Did you or Simon
ever take anyone else there?

21:06.610 --> 21:08.410
No. He...

21:10.410 --> 21:13.770
..broke up with me.
Broke up with you? Why?

21:15.410 --> 21:17.410
More interested in that church,
I guess.

21:19.410 --> 21:22.410
You know... Rosa Shapland's
a member of the church?

21:22.410 --> 21:24.410
Rosa who?

21:26.410 --> 21:28.410
She's missing.

21:28.410 --> 21:31.410
Did Simon ever take Rosa
to the chalet?

21:35.410 --> 21:36.410
I don't know.

21:37.410 --> 21:39.250
Maybe.

21:42.090 --> 21:43.410
I didn't even really know him.

21:46.410 --> 21:49.610
'She is hurt. Angry.'

21:49.610 --> 21:52.410
Hiding it, but...
Is it possibility that...

21:52.410 --> 21:54.410
she knew about Walden and Rosa?

21:54.410 --> 21:58.090
Killed him out of jealousy and...
abducted her?

21:58.090 --> 22:00.410
Well, whoever took Rosa
knew about the chalet.

22:00.410 --> 22:02.410
Who else did, apart from her?

22:02.410 --> 22:04.410
Why hide
they were sleeping together?

22:04.410 --> 22:07.410
Eurgh. Your housemate?
That's gotta be awkward.

22:07.410 --> 22:11.250
I need to speak to Rosa's mother.
All right, Sir.

22:12.410 --> 22:14.410
So, did you tell him?
That your barman

22:14.410 --> 22:17.450
is now a person of interest
in our investigation?

22:17.450 --> 22:20.410
I'm sure
you'll take great pleasure in it.

22:20.410 --> 22:23.410
I'm actually
not that much of a prick.

22:27.410 --> 22:30.410
It's her blood?
We think so.

22:34.410 --> 22:37.410
There's no sign
of what happened to her next.

22:37.410 --> 22:39.410
But we'll keep searching.

22:39.410 --> 22:41.410
Do you think she's still alive?

22:45.410 --> 22:46.450
I don't know, Ruth.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.410
But I promise you...

22:51.930 --> 22:53.410
..we will find her.

23:04.410 --> 23:05.410
Matthew.

23:08.410 --> 23:09.410
Will you...

23:11.410 --> 23:12.410
..come in for a minute?

23:17.410 --> 23:18.450
Er...

23:27.410 --> 23:31.410
Oh, erm, you... Go through.
I-I just... wanna fetch something.

23:57.410 --> 24:00.410
We followed your career.
In the newspapers.

24:01.610 --> 24:03.610
I ordered them from Bristol.

24:16.410 --> 24:20.410
It was no surprise to us
that you'd done well as a detective.

24:20.410 --> 24:25.410
You were raised to listen...
rather than talk, and...

24:25.410 --> 24:28.410
always were an observant child.

24:30.410 --> 24:32.410
Noticing... everything.

24:37.410 --> 24:41.250
I never tried
to pretend you didn't exist.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.930
You left us, Matthew.

24:45.410 --> 24:46.410
You left us.

24:48.410 --> 24:50.410
No. I left the church.

24:51.410 --> 24:54.250
You told me
I wasn't welcome in this house.

24:55.410 --> 24:59.410
Well, that's because I...
knew I'd already lost you.

25:02.410 --> 25:04.610
Er...

25:04.610 --> 25:07.410
This little world of ours...

25:09.410 --> 25:12.410
..I know people make fun of us.

25:12.410 --> 25:15.410
What we try and hold onto.

25:15.410 --> 25:19.410
I knew when you were, oh, 15, 16...

25:21.090 --> 25:24.410
..it... it wasn't enough for you.

25:26.410 --> 25:28.410
So, I didn't believe.

25:31.090 --> 25:32.770
We could've still been a family,
couldn't we?

25:40.410 --> 25:43.410
D'you remember that visit,
that Christmas?

25:43.410 --> 25:45.410
You know,
after you'd left for university.

25:46.410 --> 25:47.770
When you were 19.

25:50.410 --> 25:54.410
I could feel how much
you didn't want to be here.

25:54.410 --> 25:55.410
Even before you...

25:57.410 --> 25:58.930
..you stood up in that meeting.

26:00.410 --> 26:04.250
I could see...
how ridiculous you found us.

26:06.410 --> 26:07.410
The contempt you felt.

26:09.410 --> 26:12.410
You rejected
everything we'd given you.

26:14.410 --> 26:16.410
Everything we'd raised you to be.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.410
Everything we wanted for you.

26:22.410 --> 26:25.410
I've been grieving that
for 20 years.

26:29.410 --> 26:31.410
What you should've been.

26:31.410 --> 26:33.610
Who you should've been.

26:40.410 --> 26:44.410
And... the grief's turned me sour.

26:46.410 --> 26:50.410
Took any joy
I-I had left and... dried it up.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.410
Stopped me forgiving...

26:56.410 --> 26:58.410
..hoping for things.

27:00.770 --> 27:02.410
Your poor dad.

27:03.410 --> 27:04.410
I did wrong...

27:05.410 --> 27:09.410
..not bringing you here
in his last days.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.410
I know I did.

27:11.410 --> 27:14.410
But it wasn't because of...

27:14.410 --> 27:16.410
what you thought.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.410
Er...

27:29.770 --> 27:34.410
His-his name's... Jonathan,
by the way.

27:38.410 --> 27:39.450
Oh.

28:04.410 --> 28:07.410
So, the police haven't
made any progress?

28:07.410 --> 28:09.610
They haven't arrested anyone yet.

28:11.410 --> 28:13.410
And you haven't been sleeping,
by the looks of it.

28:13.410 --> 28:15.930
I'm OK.
No, you're not.

28:15.930 --> 28:18.410
Your housemate died
and you're grieving.

28:18.410 --> 28:20.410
You need a few weeks' fun.

28:20.410 --> 28:23.410
Somewhere away
from all this trauma.

28:23.410 --> 28:26.250
I was thinking Barcelona.

28:28.410 --> 28:30.410
Barcelona?
On me.

28:30.410 --> 28:32.410
You can fly from Bristol
on Wednesday.

28:34.410 --> 28:36.410
Dad, I have work.
You can take a holiday.

28:38.090 --> 28:40.250
I've asked Ed to move in.

28:42.410 --> 28:44.410
That could wait till you got back,
couldn't it?

28:44.410 --> 28:46.610
He's moving his stuff today.

28:48.610 --> 28:50.410
Well...

28:50.410 --> 28:52.770
just think about it, OK?

28:55.930 --> 28:58.410
For someone who always says
we don't spend enough time together,

28:58.410 --> 29:01.410
you're quite keen
to get rid of me recently.

29:01.410 --> 29:03.410
What are you not telling me?

29:03.410 --> 29:06.410
That you need a break. That's all.
Right.

29:09.410 --> 29:10.410
Is that why you told them

29:10.410 --> 29:12.610
to take me off the volunteer rota
at the Woodyard?

29:12.610 --> 29:15.410
I know how busy you are.

29:15.410 --> 29:17.410
Caroline...

29:18.450 --> 29:20.410
Gaby said I'd find you here.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.410
I, er, need to talk to you
about Simon.

29:23.610 --> 29:26.090
Erm, sure.

29:28.410 --> 29:29.770
Great, thanks.

29:29.770 --> 29:33.410
Did you know that Gaby
and Simon were together?

29:41.770 --> 29:43.410
Who's that for?

29:44.410 --> 29:46.410
I thought we could... talk?

29:48.250 --> 29:51.410
About the lies you told me?
Or the ones you told the police?

29:51.410 --> 29:53.410
Caz, I'm so sorry.

29:53.410 --> 29:55.410
You lied to us all.

29:55.410 --> 29:58.410
You potentially
impeded the murder investigation.

29:58.410 --> 30:00.410
Everything's been a big act,
and you got caught.

30:00.410 --> 30:02.410
So you don't want to talk.

30:02.410 --> 30:04.410
You want me to say I forgive you.
Well, I don't.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.410
You know what,
I thought it was weird.

30:09.410 --> 30:14.410
The little jokes, glib comments,
like it was all so ironic.

30:14.410 --> 30:17.410
I thought, everyone has
their own way of coping.

30:17.410 --> 30:19.410
The man you were with had died.

30:21.410 --> 30:23.410
Why didn't you tell me
you were with him?

30:24.770 --> 30:27.410
I was... embarrassed.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.410
He was a good person.
He was an alcoholic.

30:37.410 --> 30:39.410
It wasn't like it was
a normal relationship.

30:41.410 --> 30:43.410
Are you hiding anything else?

30:44.410 --> 30:45.930
No.

30:55.410 --> 30:58.410
What's going on, maid?

30:58.410 --> 31:00.250
Nothing.

31:00.250 --> 31:04.090
I saw you getting into his car.
The bloke from the Woodyard.

31:04.090 --> 31:06.410
The handyman.
You followed me?

31:06.410 --> 31:11.410
Rosa is missing. Someone took her.
You had no right.

31:11.410 --> 31:13.610
You are gonna tell me everything,
or I swear to God

31:13.610 --> 31:16.410
you'll not be
leaving this house alone again.

31:16.410 --> 31:19.410
I am sick and tired
of you treating me like a child!

31:19.410 --> 31:22.770
You are a child! You always will be!

31:22.770 --> 31:25.410
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.410
Lucy!

31:56.090 --> 31:58.770
I think I officially
came out to my mum today.

32:01.410 --> 32:03.410
You've been hiding it so well

32:05.410 --> 32:06.610
Shut up.

32:12.090 --> 32:14.410
She had this... scrapbook.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.410
All of my cases,
going back over the years.

32:16.410 --> 32:19.410
Er... clippings from local papers.

32:20.610 --> 32:24.250
You know, it's OK
to want your mum to be proud of you.

32:24.250 --> 32:27.410
Yeah. She's proud of my work,
but she's not proud of me, is she?

32:27.410 --> 32:28.770
Not of us.

32:30.410 --> 32:32.410
Do you want her to be?

32:32.410 --> 32:34.770
I don't know.

32:38.410 --> 32:40.410
Do you wanna drink some vodka
and go skinny dipping?

32:40.410 --> 32:43.410
Yes.

32:43.410 --> 32:46.410
Yes, well...

32:46.410 --> 32:48.410
Wait.

32:50.090 --> 32:51.610
Yep?

32:53.410 --> 32:55.410
Well, I'll meet you there
in half an hour.

32:56.450 --> 32:58.410
Rosa?
Yeah.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.410
A woman on the bus thinks
she might have seen her

33:00.410 --> 33:01.410
in the woods near Lovacott.

33:01.410 --> 33:04.410
Alive? Don't know.
Well, I'm coming with you.

33:10.410 --> 33:12.930
Anything?
Not yet.

33:12.930 --> 33:14.410
Get this road closed
in both directions.

33:14.410 --> 33:18.410
If Rosa's body's here,
it's us who's finding her. Right.

33:23.410 --> 33:24.410
Dad?

34:32.410 --> 34:34.410
'Rosa?'

34:34.410 --> 34:37.410
Rosa?
Rosa? Rosa, can you hear us?

34:37.410 --> 34:39.410
Can you hear us?

34:39.410 --> 34:44.610
Rosa?
Rosa?

34:50.450 --> 34:52.410
Over here!

35:02.410 --> 35:06.410
She has a laceration to her scalp
and she's very confused.

35:06.410 --> 35:08.410
But overall, she's doing well.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.410
Do we know
what caused the laceration?

35:10.410 --> 35:13.770
Possibly a fall. Possibly...
a blow with something blunt.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.930
The head injury means

35:15.930 --> 35:18.410
she may not have clear memories
of what happened.

35:19.410 --> 35:22.250
OK, thanks.
Thanks.

35:25.410 --> 35:27.410
Have we got anything
on the necklace?

35:27.410 --> 35:29.770
No DNA or prints on it.

35:29.770 --> 35:32.410
Big brand, though...
120 quid.

35:32.410 --> 35:35.410
How many sold
in the last three months?

35:35.410 --> 35:37.410
Er, 500-odd across the country.

35:37.410 --> 35:40.250
We can pull the credit card
transactions, but not the cash.

35:40.250 --> 35:42.410
But they've got the times and dates
of the sales?

35:42.410 --> 35:46.410
Well, let's get all of the in-store
CCTV within a hundred miles

35:46.410 --> 35:50.410
and find out if it was Walden
who bought the necklace. Sir.

36:04.410 --> 36:05.450
Matthew.

36:10.410 --> 36:12.410
Well done.

36:15.410 --> 36:18.410
You could...
come and eat with us later...

36:21.410 --> 36:22.410
..if you wanted to.

36:54.410 --> 36:57.410
Hello? Can I help you?

36:58.770 --> 37:01.410
My boyfriend broke up with me
for this place.

37:01.410 --> 37:04.410
I heard it's a cult.
Did you indeed?

37:05.410 --> 37:07.250
Would you like to see for yourself?

37:10.410 --> 37:12.090
Come on...

37:12.090 --> 37:14.410
'Look, we don't believe in
religious symbols,

37:14.410 --> 37:16.410
'clergy, or hierarchy.'

37:17.410 --> 37:21.410
That's why we've got these circles
instead of pews and an altar.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.450
Anyone can stand up and speak
during a meeting.

37:28.410 --> 37:29.410
Did Simon...

37:31.090 --> 37:32.410
..say anything?

37:34.770 --> 37:36.410
Simon Walden?

37:39.410 --> 37:41.410
Was he your boyfriend?

37:43.770 --> 37:46.450
He didn't say anything about... me?

37:48.930 --> 37:50.410
No.

38:01.410 --> 38:05.610
I'm so sorry...
about what happened to him.

38:09.410 --> 38:10.410
People didn't know about us.

38:12.410 --> 38:14.410
But you loved him.

38:17.770 --> 38:19.410
I'm having his baby.

38:20.770 --> 38:22.410
Oh.

38:52.410 --> 38:55.410
I'm ready
to tell you the full story.

38:55.410 --> 38:57.410
You don't have to
if it's too painful.

38:58.410 --> 38:59.610
I want to.

39:02.410 --> 39:06.410
Me and my mum and dad were
going home from a family party.

39:10.250 --> 39:11.410
My dad was driving.

39:13.410 --> 39:17.410
It was clear... no rain or anything.

39:18.770 --> 39:20.450
But somehow, we came off the road.

39:23.410 --> 39:25.410
I know how much my dad drank.

39:26.410 --> 39:30.410
I remember his breath
stinking of Scotch every night.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.610
Still, now.

39:33.610 --> 39:36.250
He'd have been tested.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.410
And... and there would've been
an inquest?

39:38.410 --> 39:39.410
You don't know what my dad is like.

39:41.410 --> 39:44.610
How he... manipulates people.

39:46.410 --> 39:48.410
He was drunk.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.610
And he killed my mum.

39:55.410 --> 39:57.410
And he covered it up.

39:59.410 --> 40:01.410
I think my dad might know
something...

40:01.410 --> 40:03.410
about Simon's death.
Why?

40:03.410 --> 40:06.250
He's been trying to keep me away.

40:06.250 --> 40:08.410
On at me about going abroad.

40:08.410 --> 40:10.410
Stopping me volunteering
at the Woodyard.

40:12.410 --> 40:16.410
I found this on my dad's computer.
A non-disclosure agreement.

40:16.410 --> 40:18.410
It's vague,
but it has Simon's name on it.

40:18.410 --> 40:21.410
He... he wanted Simon
to keep something quiet.

40:23.410 --> 40:24.450
Look, wait...

40:24.450 --> 40:27.410
You've bought his whole act.

40:27.410 --> 40:29.410
I-I just think...

40:29.410 --> 40:32.410
Look, you're upset...
you're grieving.

40:33.610 --> 40:35.410
You know nothing about grief.

40:53.770 --> 40:56.410
Feel like the big man, do you?

40:56.410 --> 41:00.090
Taking advantage
of an innocent young girl?

41:00.090 --> 41:03.410
What?
I know...

41:03.410 --> 41:05.410
about you and my maid.

41:05.410 --> 41:07.410
I'm guessing Jonathan doesn't.

41:08.450 --> 41:11.410
Betting the police don't either.

41:11.410 --> 41:13.410
She's not a kid.
She can do what she wants.

41:13.410 --> 41:15.250
You young prick!

41:15.250 --> 41:18.410
You think that
I'm some doddering old fool.

41:18.410 --> 41:20.930
You don't know what I'm capable of.

41:20.930 --> 41:24.410
You don't know
what I'd do for that girl.

41:30.410 --> 41:33.410
Sir, we've unlocked Walden's laptop.

41:33.410 --> 41:35.930
'So, he used messaging apps
from his laptop.'

41:35.930 --> 41:38.410
We managed to retrieve the archive.

41:41.450 --> 41:44.250
So someone was telling Simon
to stay away from Rosa?

41:44.250 --> 41:47.410
Maybe Walden had done something to
Rosa and this person had found out?

41:47.410 --> 41:51.410
Well, yeah.
But then, Walden sent this reply.

41:51.410 --> 41:53.410
That was sent
to an unregistered burner.

41:53.410 --> 41:56.770
There's also emails
sent to a solicitor,

41:56.770 --> 41:59.250
talking about putting his whole 200K

41:59.250 --> 42:00.610
into a trust account
in the Woodyard's name.

42:02.410 --> 42:05.410
200 grand to charity?
Yeah, what if it wasn't charity?

42:05.410 --> 42:08.410
What if it was...
some form of redemption?

42:08.410 --> 42:11.410
Rosa was being hurt,
but not by Simon.

42:11.410 --> 42:13.770
He was going after whoever it was
who had been hurting her,

42:13.770 --> 42:15.410
and they found out.

42:15.410 --> 42:18.410
Is the CCTV footage in
from the jewellery stores yet? Yeah.

42:18.410 --> 42:20.410
If we find out
who gave Rosa that necklace,

42:20.410 --> 42:21.410
we might find out
who was hurting her.

42:22.610 --> 42:24.770
Maybe even Simon Walden's killer,
too.

42:26.410 --> 42:28.410
Right, I'll-I'll get on it.

43:31.610 --> 43:33.410
Matthew.

43:35.250 --> 43:38.410
Thank you for finding our girl.
Mm.

44:05.410 --> 44:07.250
Matthew?

44:10.250 --> 44:12.410
You're not staying to eat?

44:17.410 --> 44:19.410
I-I can't, I...

44:21.410 --> 44:23.410
I thought I could meet him.

44:29.410 --> 44:31.410
Jonathan...

44:31.410 --> 44:33.410
sometime.

44:35.250 --> 44:36.410
If you wanted.

45:07.410 --> 45:09.410
Sir?

45:09.410 --> 45:10.610
Gotta see this.

45:10.610 --> 45:13.410
Right, so you don't see him
make the purchase...

45:13.410 --> 45:16.410
but it's right day, right time.

45:16.410 --> 45:17.930
It's him.

45:41.410 --> 45:43.410
