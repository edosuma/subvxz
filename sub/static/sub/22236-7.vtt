00:00.664 --> 00:02.906
- Of course I remember the carving.
- I knew it!

00:02.907 --> 00:06.471
I didn't do that with you.
I was with my boyfriend, Sammy.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.682
<i>You were never born.</i>

00:07.683 --> 00:10.544
Your parents had another son, and
the two of you are so alike!

00:10.545 --> 00:12.165
Hey, I'm nothing
like that twisted gimp!

00:14.914 --> 00:16.384
You just saved my life!

00:16.385 --> 00:18.045
My mission was to deliver this!

00:18.391 --> 00:20.051
I've never been admired before.

00:20.134 --> 00:21.450
I'm Ellen.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.894
Sarah, everything OK?

00:23.895 --> 00:27.399
My mum's got a whole new life,
and she's married to Bates!

00:27.400 --> 00:28.860
- Mr. Bates? What!?
- Whoa!

00:29.180 --> 00:31.404
<i>Behold -
the elemental talisman.</i>

00:31.405 --> 00:33.860
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee.

00:34.614 --> 00:37.767
- My dog WikiLeaks is missing.
- Zeus.

00:37.768 --> 00:39.639
Zeus! Come on, boy!

01:29.568 --> 01:32.568
Synced by pleven4ever & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:47.720 --> 01:49.180
Poser!

02:12.437 --> 02:15.268
Oh, my God! He's so cute!

02:18.320 --> 02:21.071
Hey, Sam, my sister showed me
your YouTube video last night.

02:21.072 --> 02:23.496
It was so cool!
Wish I could skate like...

02:25.256 --> 02:27.833
Yeah, man, sick moves.

02:27.834 --> 02:30.100
1,200 views in one week.
You should go pro.

02:31.354 --> 02:33.092
Maybe.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.957
Dude, she's the hottest girl
in Bremin.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.060
Yeah, not quite the way I imagined
rocking back up to Bremin High.

03:02.409 --> 03:04.781
I still don't get
why we have to go to school.

03:04.782 --> 03:07.196
You want the police off your backs,
you go to school.

03:07.197 --> 03:09.792
Gary was on my case AGAIN
this morning,

03:09.981 --> 03:12.076
so try not to do anything
suspicious.

03:12.077 --> 03:14.853
- Bit late for that.
- You didn't have to bring us here.

03:14.854 --> 03:18.409
Well, you can't just turn up to
school without your Aunty Phoebe.

03:18.410 --> 03:19.821
She creeps me out.

03:19.822 --> 03:20.967
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.069
Well, at least this place
hasn't changed.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.599
- Famous last words.
- Now, this is where the magic happens.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.418
Felix, can you help me out
at the shop after school?

03:35.077 --> 03:37.904
- OK.
- Excellent.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.520
- OK, let's do this!
- Dude, are you actually excited?

03:43.521 --> 03:46.231
This is way better than hanging out
in that lame shed.

03:46.629 --> 03:49.869
There's a canteen, showers,
hot girls.

03:49.870 --> 03:52.679
And a library!
I can study wormholes.

03:54.090 --> 03:56.670
It's like he was born
without an 'off' switch.

04:23.014 --> 04:26.262
Ah, that's right, Bremin High,
I am back!

04:26.320 --> 04:29.330
It's that guy from the bus.
Oh, he's so cute!

04:29.331 --> 04:31.580
Different universe, same Sam.

04:31.581 --> 04:34.672
- They're not looking at you, man.
- What do you mean?

04:35.674 --> 04:39.489
You saved the girl from the bus!
You're an inspiration.

04:39.490 --> 04:43.001
Apparently the bus had lost
control. He's SUCH a hero.

04:43.610 --> 04:46.300
- This is awkward.
- Just go with it, man.

04:46.305 --> 04:48.045
I don't know
what that means.

05:06.705 --> 05:08.325
Well, this sucks.

05:10.120 --> 05:12.745
- Hi again.
- Hi.

05:12.823 --> 05:14.780
Do you wanna sit with us at lunch?

05:14.781 --> 05:16.900
We have pretty much
the best spot on the oval.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.340
Sure, as long as it's not too close
to the big oak tree.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.380
The pollen sets off my allergies.

05:24.161 --> 05:27.871
Rightio, class,
these boys are new to the area.

05:27.872 --> 05:29.700
This is their first day
at Bremin High.

05:29.701 --> 05:32.172
I trust you'll all make them feel
very welcome.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.369
Perfect. Uhm...

05:36.370 --> 05:38.990
Perhaps you'd like to introduce
yourselves to the class, boys.

05:39.704 --> 05:44.703
My name is Felix, and these are
my cousins Jake, Andy, and Sam,

05:44.704 --> 05:49.484
and we're here for an exchange
while our parents are away for work,

05:49.485 --> 05:51.500
and we're staying
with our Aunt Phoebe.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.671
The Witch Lady? Ooh,
I'm gonna turn you into toads!

05:55.916 --> 05:59.645
OK, that's enough! Let's get started.
Boys, you can take a seat.

05:59.646 --> 06:01.020
Andy, over here!

06:01.080 --> 06:05.743
<i>So, today we will be
experimenting further</i>

06:05.744 --> 06:09.420
<i>with methods for extracting
chemical compounds from plants.</i>

06:09.441 --> 06:14.612
<i>Last week, we discovered
that chemiluminescence levels</i>

06:14.613 --> 06:19.172
<i>can be altered in the presence
of an oxidising agent, if you recall.</i>

06:19.206 --> 06:20.626
Hi. I'm Mike.

06:20.686 --> 06:23.106
<i>And this week,
using an evaporation method...</i>

06:23.166 --> 06:25.259
I don't get what Mia sees
in that jerk!

06:25.260 --> 06:27.040
Um, you?

06:27.331 --> 06:28.751
What?

06:28.752 --> 06:32.546
You and Sammy, you're sort of similar,
except he's better-looking.

06:32.606 --> 06:36.248
Come on, I'm nothing like
that doofus!

06:40.285 --> 06:43.063
<i>Go Sammy!
Oh, that was pretty cool.</i>

06:43.126 --> 06:45.141
<i>Look at that!
Nice one, man.</i>

06:47.546 --> 06:49.649
- Pretty twisted, huh?
- Yeah.

06:49.959 --> 06:53.906
- He skates just like you, too.
- Oh, come on! I'm heaps better than him.

06:53.966 --> 06:55.626
I'm just saying.

06:56.396 --> 06:58.354
You know that used to be us?

06:58.479 --> 07:01.106
Except we were never such lame
attention seekers.

07:02.151 --> 07:04.466
- You sure?
- Yeah.

07:05.055 --> 07:07.348
Come on, let's <i>try</i>.

07:07.532 --> 07:10.122
- Try what?
- To fit in.

07:10.493 --> 07:14.214
- What for?
- Because we may be here for a while!

07:14.232 --> 07:17.468
Man, don't say
things like that.

07:21.794 --> 07:23.799
So, I'll take you
to my favourite spot...

07:23.800 --> 07:24.924
Ellen!

07:27.235 --> 07:28.407
Yes...?

07:28.926 --> 07:31.661
Did you find your dog,
WikiLeaks?

07:32.073 --> 07:33.189
No.

07:33.722 --> 07:38.629
If you want, we could put up fliers
after school, around the shops.

07:38.689 --> 07:41.366
- That's a really good idea.
- Cool, well...

07:41.367 --> 07:44.747
Hey, Andy, do you wanna help
after school, putting up fliers?

07:48.084 --> 07:52.397
Then the bus swerved past,
missing us by mere millimetres.

07:52.449 --> 07:55.289
I could feel the heat of the engine
roaring past me.

07:55.290 --> 07:57.809
It was like the whole world
was in slow motion.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.791
Did you realise
how dangerous it was?

07:59.884 --> 08:03.581
I just kept thinking Bear Grylls
has done scarier things than this.

08:04.536 --> 08:08.494
I am putting all this on my blog.
It's called <i>Interview with a Hero</i>.

08:08.495 --> 08:10.924
How come you haven't RSVPed
to my party yet?

08:10.960 --> 08:13.540
I only got the message,
like, 30 seconds ago.

08:15.443 --> 08:17.783
You should come.
It's in a week.

08:17.784 --> 08:20.257
We could go together,
if you want to.

08:21.921 --> 08:24.524
But if you've already got plans
and stuff, that's totally cool.

08:24.525 --> 08:27.631
- No, sure. Sounds fun.
- Cool.

08:42.820 --> 08:45.507
Nice shot, mate!
Join in.

08:47.014 --> 08:48.785
<i>This guy's a natural.</i>

09:19.043 --> 09:20.639
Hey! Hey!

09:21.323 --> 09:23.088
Show and tell!

09:23.301 --> 09:24.595
Jerks!

09:36.600 --> 09:39.620
Hear ye, I call upon
the dragon Tolreth

09:39.621 --> 09:43.152
to help save this kingdom
forsaken by darkness.

09:44.667 --> 09:49.662
- What are you doing here?
- Even aliens have to go to school.

09:50.353 --> 09:51.719
So, what are you up to?

09:51.720 --> 09:53.980
Just plotting the destruction
of the universe.

09:54.157 --> 09:55.443
Cool.

09:56.677 --> 09:57.976
Wanna help?

09:58.582 --> 09:59.850
Yeah.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.957
Mia, wait up, wait up!

10:08.152 --> 10:11.033
The other day was just my lame
attempt at trying to impress you.

10:11.034 --> 10:14.383
Yeah, that makes sense, because
being lame is always impressive.

10:16.237 --> 10:19.137
You're right, you're right,
it was stupid, it was stupid.

10:19.197 --> 10:21.177
Hey, I heard you're a great
web designer.

10:21.237 --> 10:24.888
Maybe you could help me
make my own skating website.

10:26.409 --> 10:29.589
Look, Mia, please,
I just want to talk to you!

10:30.199 --> 10:33.670
Look, I really don't know
that much about you, OK?

10:33.671 --> 10:36.897
And I have a boyfriend who, when
I last checked, wanted you dead.

10:36.957 --> 10:38.457
I made this for you.

10:41.117 --> 10:42.678
Is that me?

10:44.033 --> 10:47.070
- It's good.
- Just back off!

10:49.877 --> 10:51.817
Give it back to her.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.723
Fighting again, are you serious?
You're as bad as each other!

10:58.724 --> 11:00.387
Mia, wait!

11:01.475 --> 11:04.761
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

11:04.790 --> 11:07.730
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

11:17.828 --> 11:19.477
Aren't you
going to help?

11:20.251 --> 11:21.363
Mia!

11:24.855 --> 11:26.891
What is going on here?!

11:27.854 --> 11:30.205
- Nothing.
- That kid's a thief!

11:30.944 --> 11:32.663
Right, principal's office,
both of you!

11:32.668 --> 11:34.688
He broke into my house!
He's a maniac!

11:34.689 --> 11:36.766
- Now!
- I didn't do anything!

11:36.781 --> 11:39.503
My blog is gonna be
so action-packed!

11:39.515 --> 11:42.235
In the grounds of school, we do not
condone fighting, Jacob.

11:42.236 --> 11:45.192
- I don't know what Mum sees in you.
- I beg your pardon?

11:52.303 --> 11:53.843
Mia, wait!

11:54.083 --> 11:56.585
Mia, I'm sorry.

11:56.968 --> 12:00.106
You and Sammy are the same -
completely selfish.

12:00.166 --> 12:03.297
- Hey, I'm nothing like Sammy.
- Really?

12:03.298 --> 12:07.779
So, coming up to me all the time, even
when I ask you not to, that's not selfish?

12:07.780 --> 12:09.400
Fighting with my boyfriend,

12:09.401 --> 12:13.664
embarrassing me in front of all
my friends, that's for my sake, is it?

12:15.073 --> 12:16.488
You're right.

12:17.094 --> 12:19.353
Maybe we are
the same.

12:19.995 --> 12:22.987
I'm sorry.
I won't bother you anymore.

12:28.525 --> 12:30.121
This really is for you,

12:30.824 --> 12:34.282
and you should learn how to skate,
I know you want to.

12:57.287 --> 12:58.447
Mia!

12:59.551 --> 13:02.852
Mia! I need
your advice!

13:02.853 --> 13:06.346
- Hi.
- It's urgent. I need your full attention.

13:06.406 --> 13:08.266
OK, you've got it.

13:08.326 --> 13:10.706
How can you tell
if a boy likes you?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.674
I guess
they pay attention to you.

13:12.675 --> 13:15.982
He's done most of the talking so far.
Any other signs?

13:15.983 --> 13:17.943
They care about what you want.

13:17.944 --> 13:21.044
Like, if you wanted to learn
to skate, they'd encourage you.

13:21.046 --> 13:22.826
That hasn't come up.

13:23.951 --> 13:27.629
That is gorgeous!
Did Sammy do that?

13:27.630 --> 13:31.026
Um... Are you talking about
that boy from the bus?

13:31.086 --> 13:34.828
- Oh, he's so cute!
- You go, girl!

13:36.253 --> 13:38.113
You should get that framed.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.154
Was that a dog?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.302
It's your turn.

13:49.303 --> 13:54.125
OK, this time let's be brothers,
torn apart by a savage war.

13:54.126 --> 13:57.426
Started by
an outcast alien life force.

13:57.486 --> 14:01.697
We've just been reunited in a galactic
battle and have to save our father.

14:02.046 --> 14:04.266
Penethor, is that you?

14:04.326 --> 14:07.146
Come, there is much fortune
to be had in Theden,

14:07.206 --> 14:09.426
but first we must stand united!

14:09.486 --> 14:12.506
But, Penethor,
it is I, Morden.

14:12.683 --> 14:14.103
Brother?

14:15.272 --> 14:16.914
Yes, it's me...

14:17.434 --> 14:18.995
Your brother.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.440
Hey, brainy dude.

14:32.547 --> 14:35.443
I never realised being popular
was so stressful!

14:35.486 --> 14:36.986
Why's that?

14:37.046 --> 14:40.773
Being noticed all the time,
girls hanging off my every word...

14:40.774 --> 14:44.386
I can feel my anxiety levels creeping
up on me with every compliment.

14:45.519 --> 14:49.091
If it's any consolation,
being unpopular sucks too.

14:51.366 --> 14:53.168
- That's him!
- Hey!

14:53.616 --> 14:55.555
Are you the kid
that fought my brother?

14:55.560 --> 14:58.340
- Yeah, that's me.
- Should I go find a teacher?

14:58.716 --> 15:01.653
Look, guys,
we don't have to fight.

15:02.494 --> 15:05.359
Maybe you should have thought of that
<i>before</i> you got Sammy in trouble.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.855
You know what, let's make this fair.
Just you and me.

15:11.256 --> 15:13.615
Time to use my secret powers.

15:13.895 --> 15:17.964
Look, Vince, I'm not afraid of you.
You still wet the bed.

15:17.965 --> 15:20.087
What's he on about?

15:20.335 --> 15:23.635
Sammy told me about
your little accidents.

15:23.695 --> 15:27.342
- About how you have bad dreams.
- Why would Sammy say that?

15:27.343 --> 15:31.830
Oh, and Sammy also told me about how
he found you in your mum's bikini.

15:32.758 --> 15:35.700
Ooh, a swimwear model!

15:36.672 --> 15:38.162
Sammy...!

15:38.312 --> 15:39.998
- Hey, Vince?
- What?

15:39.999 --> 15:41.619
- Still single?
- Shut up!

15:42.552 --> 15:44.235
Impressive.

15:44.295 --> 15:47.675
I think I just got Sammy in trouble.
Should I feel bad?

15:48.192 --> 15:51.769
You found a nonviolent solution
to a violent situation.

15:52.407 --> 15:54.143
Speaking of solutions,

15:54.203 --> 15:56.857
I've let my popularity get
in the way of my true mission.

15:56.858 --> 16:00.003
- Which is...?
- Wormholes! I'll see you back in class!

16:01.649 --> 16:04.579
Once a nerd,
always a nerd.

16:10.241 --> 16:13.498
___

16:14.136 --> 16:17.383
- I knew it!
- I thought I was giving you the tour.

16:17.443 --> 16:19.464
Looks like you know this place
better than I do.

16:19.465 --> 16:22.082
Yes, well, I have an affinity
for libraries.

16:22.083 --> 16:26.703
So, have you had any interesting
correspondence lately?

16:26.763 --> 16:29.103
That would presuppose
a letterbox, so, no.

16:29.163 --> 16:30.742
Are you sure?

16:30.743 --> 16:33.809
Actually, I did get a hand-delivered
note the other day.

16:33.903 --> 16:36.720
- It was very peculiar.
- Really? Why?

16:36.721 --> 16:40.024
The message was kind of cryptic.
It said...

16:40.087 --> 16:42.186
'Me into you'...
No.

16:42.303 --> 16:45.436
- 'U + M...'
- To the power of E equals...

16:45.833 --> 16:47.373
That was from you?

16:47.374 --> 16:51.194
I wanted to thank you for saving me,
but I couldn't find you on Facebook.

16:51.663 --> 16:53.001
Thanks.

16:53.115 --> 16:58.000
I don't normally like popular,
heroic types, but you're different.

16:58.006 --> 17:00.892
Maybe because I'm not really
either of those things.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.137
It's just a strange alignment
of circumstan...

17:03.138 --> 17:07.002
See what I mean? Who even
says that? So cute!

17:10.844 --> 17:12.704
<i>Attention, all teachers.</i>

17:12.705 --> 17:15.122
<i>There'll be a meeting
in the staffroom...</i>

17:15.553 --> 17:20.723
- Oh. Excuse me, have you seen Mr. Bates?
- Yeah, he should be back in a minute.

17:21.020 --> 17:24.390
- Hey, how are you?
- Oh, hi!

17:24.391 --> 17:26.959
Did you and your... dad
find a house?

17:26.982 --> 17:28.826
Oh! Um, not yet.

17:28.886 --> 17:32.226
Sorry about the other day,
rushing off like that.

17:32.286 --> 17:34.063
If you want some help, let me know,

17:34.064 --> 17:36.685
because we've just listed a couple of
fantastic properties.

17:36.686 --> 17:39.426
I will! Thanks.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.918
Oh! Oh, I've just got to catch
my breath.

17:48.712 --> 17:52.706
- So, who's looking after your kids today?
- Oh, Mr Bates and I don't have any kids.

17:54.085 --> 17:57.287
- I'm... I didn't mean to...
- Is it hot in here, or...

17:57.956 --> 17:59.368
I guess.

17:59.369 --> 18:03.789
Oh, excuse me, I've got to...
gotta go home.

18:18.281 --> 18:20.004
You're good, you know.

18:24.419 --> 18:26.129
My mum's an artist.

18:27.137 --> 18:28.931
Or... was.

18:29.173 --> 18:33.378
I mean, is! She's not dead,
or anything. She's just not here.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.429
- Sorry for before.
- It's OK.

18:37.735 --> 18:40.675
You don't have to apologise
every time you get angry.

18:40.844 --> 18:43.357
Sometimes you should just
let yourself be angry.

18:43.358 --> 18:45.516
How come you know
so much about me?

18:47.237 --> 18:52.137
Where I come from, I used to date
a girl who was just like you,

18:52.335 --> 18:55.312
except now
I'm only just figuring out

18:55.313 --> 18:57.624
that I should have treated her
the way she deserved.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.413
Well, at least
you've learned something.

18:59.414 --> 19:03.595
Like, she wanted to know how
to skate, except I never taught her,

19:03.596 --> 19:06.372
and I told her it was because
I didn't want her to fall,

19:06.373 --> 19:07.878
but you wanna know
the real reason?

19:07.879 --> 19:09.289
You were worried
she'd be better than you?

19:09.290 --> 19:10.453
No way!

19:11.484 --> 19:16.214
The real reason is because
I liked it when she was watching me.

19:16.415 --> 19:20.955
You know, I liked the feeling of her
watching me being good at something.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.170
Pretty selfish, huh?

19:23.800 --> 19:26.340
But kind of sweet.

19:33.769 --> 19:34.984
Oh, my God!

19:40.349 --> 19:42.274
Don't make any sudden movements.

19:46.899 --> 19:49.195
- That was odd.
- Spooky...

19:49.288 --> 19:51.023
And romantic.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.896
What should we do?

19:56.178 --> 19:58.438
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.140
Oh, my God, it's WikiLeaks!

20:08.200 --> 20:11.918
Stay back! Whatever you do,
don't look him in the eye.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.191
Bear Grylls once did that to a rhino.

20:32.316 --> 20:36.155
You just scared away my dog
who's been missing for a week!

20:36.156 --> 20:39.021
- WikiLeaks, wait!
- Ellen, don't!

20:40.741 --> 20:43.401
- I'm over here!
- What are you doing?

20:43.402 --> 20:45.302
- Getting help!
- Run!

20:49.274 --> 20:50.759
Run!

20:52.240 --> 20:54.137
Get out! Run!

21:00.563 --> 21:01.780
Get out of here!

21:03.560 --> 21:05.220
What's going on?

21:07.880 --> 21:10.220
- Is this like the bees?
- I think so.

21:10.241 --> 21:12.611
- So, what should we do?
- I need to find the others.

21:12.612 --> 21:14.923
- Can I help?
- Come on!

21:46.840 --> 21:48.380
I'm out of here.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.122
- We've gotta find the others.
- Let's go.

22:08.571 --> 22:11.238
- I lost Ellen! We have to find her!
- There's no time!

22:11.239 --> 22:13.733
- Have you seen Sam and Jacob?
- No! Ellen!

22:21.720 --> 22:24.660
- Are you guys OK?
- Come on, we've got to get out of here!

22:35.080 --> 22:37.332
- Come on!
- It's no use. It's locked!

22:46.978 --> 22:48.582
Never mind!

22:49.386 --> 22:50.838
Watch this.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.841
Come on...!

22:56.270 --> 22:59.060
- It worked before!
- Quick, do something!

23:01.760 --> 23:04.420
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee...

23:04.480 --> 23:06.245
- What is he doing?
- I have no idea.

23:06.246 --> 23:11.349
Air, Fire, Water, and Earth,
aid at my quest, I call Ye forth.

23:27.081 --> 23:30.191
Amazeballs! You have to teach me
how to do that!

23:30.192 --> 23:33.661
- Felix, what just happened?
- Yeah, man, that was nuts!

23:34.915 --> 23:36.455
Hey, what is that?

23:36.456 --> 23:39.739
- Uh, Phoebe gave it to me.
- Phoebe?

24:01.259 --> 24:02.738
What is that thing?

24:02.739 --> 24:04.642
I got it from Phoebe
when the attacks started.

24:04.643 --> 24:05.916
<i>She's up to something!</i>

24:05.917 --> 24:09.017
So, now we sneak into the witch's
lair to steal her magic book.

24:09.018 --> 24:10.263
<i>If she is behind
these attacks,</i>

24:10.289 --> 24:12.289
<i>she'll need things
that belong to us for the spell.</i>

24:12.312 --> 24:13.748
Stray hair, some flaky skin.

24:13.749 --> 24:16.061
So, you want us to collect
bodily secretions?

24:16.638 --> 24:18.827
We're having dinner
at a Chinese restaurant tonight.

24:18.828 --> 24:20.288
Mum wanted me to invite you.

24:20.289 --> 24:23.709
Andy! Wasn't that insane?
I've gotta interview you.

24:23.710 --> 24:25.758
I think she just asked you
on a date.

24:25.759 --> 24:27.430
Go, Andy!

24:27.689 --> 24:29.487
There's four kinds of hair here.

24:29.488 --> 24:32.288
Man, I'm starved!
These look like pickles.

24:33.752 --> 24:35.549
That's the spell
she used against us.

24:35.609 --> 24:37.369
What's she doing?

24:37.866 --> 24:39.877
- I think that pickle...
- Was poisonous?

24:39.878 --> 24:41.321
We need to get you
to a hospital!

24:41.322 --> 24:42.426
Nai Nai!
