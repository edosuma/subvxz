You want my money,
best throw some elbow into that.

01:25.009 --> 01:27.429
$1.50. That's 2-bits shy a car wash.

01:27.512 --> 01:29.305
$1.50 each.

01:29.389 --> 01:33.476
No, man. You must have got me confused
with some other idiot.

01:34.018 --> 01:36.437
The rain's doing half your work.

01:48.199 --> 01:49.367
Look here.

01:49.867 --> 01:51.536
Bobby Earl, the cultured pearl.

01:51.619 --> 01:52.829
What's up, Gomer?

01:52.912 --> 01:54.205
Boys, take a break.

01:56.165 --> 01:57.917
Bobby Earl, we got to talk.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.711
- I said quit!
- Talk about what?

02:02.755 --> 02:04.382
Take a ride.

02:04.465 --> 02:06.467
- A ride.
- Please.

02:15.434 --> 02:16.394
It's Wilcox.

02:16.477 --> 02:19.021
I need a tech team at Ferguson's place.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.524
What kind of car is that?

02:21.983 --> 02:23.276
Leave him be!

02:23.359 --> 02:24.902
You cracker son of a bitch!

02:24.986 --> 02:27.154
- I should lock you up!
- Grandma, go inside.

02:27.238 --> 02:30.282
- Can't you just leave him be?
- I'm all right, Grandma.

02:32.660 --> 02:33.953
It's all right.

02:34.161 --> 02:35.913
I'll be back before supper.

02:48.092 --> 02:51.178
Grandma, why are they taking Bobby Earl?

02:56.225 --> 02:57.935
Give me that head!

02:58.602 --> 03:01.105
Let's shake up that cage, son!

03:01.272 --> 03:03.983
You're not getting that meat
tenderized enough?

03:04.191 --> 03:05.192
Sit down!

03:05.275 --> 03:07.403
Let's see what else we got to start with.

03:07.486 --> 03:09.488
Look here, Bobby Earl!

03:14.451 --> 03:16.620
Get the fuck up.

03:17.496 --> 03:19.623
I'll ask you nicely, son.

03:19.998 --> 03:24.294
Did you fuck her before
or after you filleted her?

03:25.337 --> 03:26.797
Country-ass motherfucker.

03:27.130 --> 03:29.174
"Asshole," is it?

03:29.424 --> 03:30.425
I'll show you!

03:31.426 --> 03:33.428
Fucking asshole!

04:35.365 --> 04:38.201
<i>"At the first official electrocution in 1890...</i>

04:38.618 --> 04:41.621
<i>"...the victim had the electrodes
removed from his head...</i>

04:41.704 --> 04:43.706
<i>"...after 15 seconds.</i>

04:43.915 --> 04:48.044
<i>"Suddenly he opened his eyes
and began gasping for air...</i>

04:48.211 --> 04:51.297
<i>"...apparently unaware
that he was supposed to be dead.</i>

04:52.298 --> 04:55.009
<i>"The warden and all present
lost their wits...</i>

04:55.093 --> 04:58.179
<i>"...before calling for the current

04:59.097 --> 05:03.810
<i>"Witnesses describe a blue flame
playing about the base of the spine.</i>

05:05.103 --> 05:08.731

<i>"Over the years, other witnesses
to electrocutions...</i>

05:12.401 --> 05:15.738
<i>"...have described the prisoner
catching fire...</i>

05:16.239 --> 05:18.741
<i>"...the electricity so powerful...</i>

05:19.075 --> 05:22.411
<i>"...that the eyeballs pop out
onto the cheeks...</i>

05:22.620 --> 05:25.331

<i>... to the 1990s.</i>

05:52.149 --> 05:54.777
<i>Over 100 years of progress.</i>

05:56.862 --> 05:59.615
<i>You paint a grim picture indeed, Professor.</i>

05:59.782 --> 06:02.618
<i>I wish you had been as vivid
describing the victims.</i>

06:02.993 --> 06:06.956
<i>They were people who suffered
far more cruel and unusual punishment...</i>

06:07.122 --> 06:10.000
<i>... than any our penal system
could even imagine.</i>

06:10.626 --> 06:12.628
<i>- I refuse to believe...
- Let me finish.</i>

06:12.795 --> 06:14.338
<i>- Let me finish.
- Very well.</i>

06:14.421 --> 06:17.091
<i>I submit to you, the issue is revenge.</i>

06:18.967 --> 06:22.137
<i>An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth, if you will.</i>

06:22.304 --> 06:24.723
<i>No, I refuse to believe
in any god or government...</i>

06:24.807 --> 06:28.811
<i>... which is willing to trade
torture for torture...</i>

06:28.894 --> 06:30.479
<i>... or death for death.</i>

06:34.316 --> 06:36.193
<i>In closing, Professor...</i>

06:36.401 --> 06:37.986
<i>... if your wife...</i>

06:38.320 --> 06:39.905
<i>... or child were murdered...</i>

06:40.656 --> 06:44.201
<i>... how would you feel
about that last statement of yours?</i>

06:46.828 --> 06:48.538
<i>How would I feel?</i>

06:50.499 --> 06:52.542
<i>Very much the same as yourself.</i>

06:53.543 --> 06:56.004
<i>But I would not want
their deaths avenged...</i>

06:56.171 --> 06:58.799
<i>... by a system as cruel
and capricious as this.</i>

07:16.191 --> 07:18.568
- You changed my mind.
- I thought I had you.

07:18.944 --> 07:21.571
- They're going to kill my boy.
- Excuse me?

07:21.738 --> 07:26.242
My grandson's in a Florida prison
on Death Row for something he didn't do.

07:26.451 --> 07:29.204
Good luck. I'll see you in Washington.

07:29.704 --> 07:32.207
I'm sorry. I no longer practice law.

07:32.374 --> 07:35.585
He said to me,
"Go up to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

07:35.752 --> 07:37.754
"Find Mr. Paul Armstrong...

07:39.089 --> 07:40.799
"...and give him this."

07:42.550 --> 07:46.721
Well, thank you.
I'll read it and get back to you.

07:46.888 --> 07:48.264
Read it now.

07:57.899 --> 07:59.108
Come far?

07:59.275 --> 08:00.902
Ochopee, Florida.

08:01.736 --> 08:03.071
A long way.

08:05.531 --> 08:08.117
"Victim was white. I am black.
No food or water."

08:08.576 --> 08:09.577
Beaten?

08:10.078 --> 08:13.748
By Mr. Tanny Brown, the black-hatingest
police in Everglade County.

08:16.417 --> 08:18.002
"Murder one.

08:19.003 --> 08:20.213
"Death penalty."

08:20.296 --> 08:22.256
The white judge was 87.

08:22.423 --> 08:26.135
He called Bobby Earl an animal,
ought to be shot.

08:29.764 --> 08:32.808
It's 25 years since I practiced law.

08:33.100 --> 08:37.647
If you say no, he said to go to Princeton,
New Jersey and find Mr. Harry Gilyard.

08:38.522 --> 08:39.523
A good man.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.942
But he said to come to you first.

08:44.945 --> 08:46.614
I'm sorry, I can't.

08:50.951 --> 08:52.661
Can I drive you somewhere?

08:52.953 --> 08:54.330
Nowhere.

08:54.538 --> 08:57.958
There a 2:00 a.m. Bus to Princeton
from the Trailways station.

08:58.334 --> 09:00.127
I can get there by myself.

09:00.336 --> 09:02.671
Thank you for your time.

09:04.256 --> 09:05.549
No, you keep it.

09:05.633 --> 09:07.676
It's got your name on it.

09:33.076 --> 09:34.328
Daddy!

09:39.082 --> 09:40.834
Wonderful, wonderful.

09:43.503 --> 09:44.504
Carry on.

09:46.882 --> 09:48.175
Where's Mommy?

09:57.517 --> 09:59.102
- Hi.
- What happened to you?

10:01.229 --> 10:05.609
I was working in juvenile detention center
this morning with this kid, Carlos.

10:05.901 --> 10:07.402
He was in for dealing.

10:07.611 --> 10:10.739
Usual rap sheet: Misdemeanors,
history of drug use.

10:11.615 --> 10:13.617
Half-hour in, I ask about his mother.

10:13.742 --> 10:17.370
And he goes berserk.
I'm on my back seeing stars.

10:17.746 --> 10:19.039
A day at the office.

10:21.541 --> 10:24.794
An hour later,
I'm standing in front of the judge...

10:24.920 --> 10:29.299
...convincing her he's perfect
for the Crossroads program instead of jail.

10:30.050 --> 10:31.718
How did you explain the eye?

10:31.885 --> 10:34.220
I told her my husband's a wife beater.

10:35.055 --> 10:36.431
Thank you very much.

10:38.224 --> 10:40.393
Why don't you go back to being a lawyer?

10:40.560 --> 10:41.728
It is safer.

10:41.895 --> 10:44.564
For who? Me or the bad guys?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.065
More popcorn, please.

10:46.441 --> 10:47.775
Daddy will bring it.

10:49.903 --> 10:52.238
Paul, how did the debate go?

10:52.405 --> 10:54.407
Little old lady showed up tonight.

10:54.657 --> 10:58.036
Tells me her grandson's on Death Row
down in Florida.

10:58.119 --> 11:00.413
A black kid. Went to Cornell.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.293
Can I see it?

11:10.298 --> 11:12.425
Back to the salt mines.

11:30.318 --> 11:32.195
He needs a lawyer...

11:32.320 --> 11:34.989
...not a teacher. And I need a drink.

11:35.781 --> 11:39.493
Did you really read this?
Maybe this one is worth checking out.

11:39.577 --> 11:42.997
Why don't you check it out?
You know Everglade County.

11:43.456 --> 11:45.458
Can we sleep outside?

11:45.624 --> 11:46.584
No way.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.170
I'd sooner go to hell
than into another courtroom.

11:51.464 --> 11:53.632
This would be really good for you.

11:53.799 --> 11:55.509
Put you in the real world.

11:56.010 --> 12:00.306
Why is every fucking thing the real world
except teaching?

12:03.809 --> 12:05.519
That's the real world?

12:05.686 --> 12:10.191
He's on Death Row. He's asking you
to put your money where your mouth is.

12:12.735 --> 12:14.486
All I'm saying is that...

12:14.737 --> 12:17.865
...every once in a while
you got to get a little bloody.

12:18.157 --> 12:19.867
It's good for the soul.

13:07.372 --> 13:09.249
- I see them.
- There they are.

13:09.583 --> 13:10.959
Grandma!

13:14.796 --> 13:16.047
Dad.

13:17.549 --> 13:18.967
What's that on your face?

13:19.050 --> 13:20.385
Hi, sweetness.

13:20.927 --> 13:21.970
Welcome.

13:30.437 --> 13:33.857
It's not a bad paper as papers go,
but that's not saying much.

13:36.943 --> 13:39.112
Delores, sweetheart.

13:40.447 --> 13:41.781
Hey, Mr. Phil.

13:41.865 --> 13:43.867
It's been a long time.

13:44.325 --> 13:45.368
Paul Armstrong.

13:45.493 --> 13:46.703
My son-in-law.

13:48.329 --> 13:51.708
Delores Rodriguez,
keeper of archives, news-trivia expert.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.293
Buried three husbands.

13:53.376 --> 13:56.337
Were it not for Libby, I could well be No. 4.

13:56.921 --> 13:58.798
How is Libby's health?

13:59.257 --> 14:00.341
It's good.

14:00.967 --> 14:01.968
Pity.

14:02.719 --> 14:03.887
Business.

14:03.970 --> 14:06.556
Paul needs information
on the Joanie Shriver murder.

14:06.973 --> 14:08.474
That poor kid from Ochopee?

14:09.642 --> 14:11.644
Watch your back in here.

14:44.218 --> 14:47.138
We are on-line back to 1985.

14:47.221 --> 14:49.390
Everything before that is on microfiche.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.726
I'll see what else I can find.

14:52.143 --> 14:53.102
How long?

14:53.644 --> 14:57.732
That depends. You'll be amazed
at what I can do with a little help.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.010
Mr. Armstrong.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.469
Sergeant Rogers?

15:27.553 --> 15:29.471
Raise your arms, please.

15:40.524 --> 15:41.859
Tape recorder.

15:47.948 --> 15:48.949
There you go.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.715
Your first time, Mr. Armstrong?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.291
Buzz when you want out.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.753
If you're unable to buzz,
don't worry about it.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.340
Sweet Jesus.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.927
The old girl said
you'd be coming up in here.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.053
I said, "No.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.764
"No, Grandma, he's too busy...

16:54.848 --> 16:58.101
"...to come all the way from Harvard
just to give me his time."

16:58.184 --> 16:59.561
But praise God...

17:00.728 --> 17:01.855
...here you is.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.694
If I really talked with
that verbal buck-and-shuffle...

17:09.529 --> 17:10.863
...I'd be free today.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.740
What's your game?

17:14.450 --> 17:15.702
It's no game.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.372
Funny thing about
small-town Florida people.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.500
Like crabs in a bucket, black or white.

17:22.583 --> 17:26.212
One tries to climb out, the others
hop on his back to put him back in.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.215
<i>Souls of Black Folk, DuBois.</i>

17:29.799 --> 17:30.883
I've read it.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.761
I'm impressed.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.556
Good.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.891
I've always been that climb-out crab.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.478
My mother OD'd on heroin
when I was 13 up in Newark.

17:42.854 --> 17:45.189
Grandma got me and brought me here.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.526
I was high school valedictorian.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.112
I got a full scholarship to Cornell, but...

17:53.239 --> 17:55.408
...they treated me like an outsider.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.454
How do you like Grandma?

18:01.747 --> 18:03.582
She's something else.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.295
She's very determined.
But why did you send her up to see me?

18:08.462 --> 18:11.757
Because you are from a small town,
like me.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.344
Fife, Scotland. First in your family
to attend a university.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.222
Magna from Cambridge. Columbia Law.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.808
Youngest assistant DA, 1960-69.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.810
Joined a law firm, 1970.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.311
1980 to the present...

18:24.603 --> 18:26.188
...Harvard professor of law...

18:26.272 --> 18:29.441
<i>...author of Process and Law,
and six books since.</i>

18:30.484 --> 18:31.694
I've read them all.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.404
Enough.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.741
Let's start.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.744
Joanie Shriver.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.496
The victim.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.290
Eleven years old. White girl.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.294
Snatched from the Ochopee
Elementary School, March 4, 1986.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.214
Found a day later, raped and cut up
in the Glades.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.133
A teacher ID'd the car
as somewhat like mine.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.220
Officer Tanny Brown come and lock me up.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.056
- I read the transcript.
- I'll tell you this:

19:01.306 --> 19:04.643
Down here, if the chief head-banger
takes a dislike to you...

19:04.768 --> 19:06.270
...your ass is his.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.064
He's a nigger who likes being a big fish...

19:09.147 --> 19:10.649
He's black?

19:11.817 --> 19:12.818
Yes.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.990
In the new South, they've got black cops
to torment your black ass.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.826
It's called affirmative action.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.124
Tell me about your confession.

19:29.709 --> 19:30.710
My confession?

19:30.836 --> 19:32.045
I was slapped.

19:32.420 --> 19:33.922
I was punched.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.882
Beaten with a phone book.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.968
Made to piss myself, kicked.

19:39.427 --> 19:40.804
Then Officer Brown...

19:40.887 --> 19:41.930
...walked in.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.111
Tanny, wait.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.531
J.T., I need you to back me up
on this one here.

20:06.621 --> 20:08.289
Pretty Robert Earl.

20:12.126 --> 20:13.670
I want to ask you...

20:15.380 --> 20:16.381
Last time.

20:16.464 --> 20:18.466
I told you. I swear.

20:18.633 --> 20:20.260
I don't know this girl.

20:20.343 --> 20:22.845
I have no reason to lie. I don't know her.

20:24.889 --> 20:26.182
Come on, talk to me.

20:26.349 --> 20:27.558
Come on, stop.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.228
What did you say to her?

20:30.311 --> 20:32.814
How'd you get her in the car? Say, "Ah."

20:39.070 --> 20:40.530
Talk to me.

20:42.740 --> 20:43.616
Talk to me.

20:45.993 --> 20:48.329
I hate pretty motherfuckers like you.

20:48.788 --> 20:50.790
I don't know no Joanie Shriver.

20:52.291 --> 20:54.085
Pretty motherfucker, talk to me.

20:54.168 --> 20:55.753
Ain't so pretty now, are you?

20:59.507 --> 21:01.676
They had me in there 22 hours.

21:01.926 --> 21:04.595
No food, no water, no sleep.

21:05.179 --> 21:06.097
No bathroom.

21:06.263 --> 21:07.556
<i>You drove her...</i>

21:07.682 --> 21:10.059
...to an isolated section of the Everglades...

21:10.935 --> 21:14.772
...approximately two and a half miles
southeast of her home.

21:18.192 --> 21:19.193
Yes.

21:22.696 --> 21:25.199
Did you drive her to that location...

21:25.449 --> 21:28.619
...with the full intent to kidnap, rape...

21:28.786 --> 21:31.121
...sodomize and kill her?

21:38.128 --> 21:40.130
Speak into the microphone.

21:44.301 --> 21:45.344
Yes.

21:59.525 --> 22:01.318
You feel better now, don't you?

22:10.535 --> 22:12.913
You're a strange fruit, Robert Earl.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.084
Strange fruit, indeed.

22:21.004 --> 22:24.549
I'd have confessed to anything.
They spoon-fed me to the Row.

22:24.716 --> 22:26.760
It's your word against theirs.

22:28.887 --> 22:30.305
I didn't do it.

22:48.823 --> 22:52.577
She's a pretty thing, but you couldn't tell it
when they brought her in.

22:52.911 --> 22:55.205
Bobby Earl was a very angry boy.

22:56.247 --> 22:59.292
Parts of her chest and abdomen were
so badly damaged...

22:59.376 --> 23:02.087
...hard to tell how many times
she was stabbed.

23:05.131 --> 23:06.549
The cuts were...

23:06.841 --> 23:09.928
...long, shallow at the ends,
deep in the middle.

23:10.428 --> 23:12.430
The wounds curved upward.

23:12.597 --> 23:14.807
- A half-moon shape.
- Like a scimitar?

23:14.891 --> 23:15.808
Yeah.

23:16.059 --> 23:17.435
But miniature.

23:17.602 --> 23:19.687
I'd say six inches, hilt to tip.

23:20.647 --> 23:22.440
Your autopsy report...

23:22.649 --> 23:25.026
...states that the girl was raped.

23:25.109 --> 23:27.111
But there's no record of any semen.

23:27.236 --> 23:28.655
There wasn't any.

23:29.947 --> 23:30.948
There wasn't?

23:31.324 --> 23:32.992
No. She was penetrated.

23:33.117 --> 23:36.621
With no semen, how did you establish
the O-positive blood?

23:37.288 --> 23:39.540
We got that from the teeth and gums.

23:44.545 --> 23:47.507
You said you examined Bobby Earl's hand...

23:47.590 --> 23:50.760
...and found cuts that could be attributed
to teeth marks.

23:51.135 --> 23:52.303
That's right.

23:52.386 --> 23:54.972
You never matched the dental plate
to the cuts.

23:55.264 --> 23:57.350
I didn't need to, once he confessed.

24:01.270 --> 24:04.941
Did you know he was beaten for 22 hours
before he gave his confession?

24:06.108 --> 24:07.151
So he says.

24:07.735 --> 24:11.197
The cuts on his hand could have been
from the beating.

24:12.698 --> 24:13.741
How convenient.

24:17.912 --> 24:18.996
Armstrong?

24:20.664 --> 24:21.332
Yes.

24:21.707 --> 24:23.000
I'm Detective Wilcox.

24:23.834 --> 24:26.420
Spoke on the phone about hooking up
with Tanny Brown?

24:26.504 --> 24:27.796
Yes. J.T. Wilcox.

24:28.255 --> 24:29.256
That's right.

24:29.757 --> 24:33.344
Tanny said he'd hook up with you
this afternoon if you're still around.

24:33.761 --> 24:35.012
Anything I can do?

24:36.347 --> 24:38.432
If you have time later, thank you.

24:39.099 --> 24:41.769
You got a busy afternoon lined up,
Mr. Armstrong.

24:43.687 --> 24:45.356
Some people to see, yes.

24:45.856 --> 24:47.316
Ever been here before?

24:48.442 --> 24:49.234
No.

24:49.777 --> 24:52.154
Come on. It's a nice little town.

24:56.366 --> 24:58.619
How's old Bobby Earl doing?

24:58.786 --> 25:01.288
He's holding it together.

25:02.539 --> 25:03.874
"Holding it together."

25:06.960 --> 25:09.671
I'd expect he would be
"holding it together."

25:09.755 --> 25:11.840
Cold-hearted son of a bitch.

25:12.925 --> 25:15.177
Stayed right frosty to the end.

25:15.552 --> 25:19.598
Get that vehicle back in the street, Charlie.
That's the last time I'll tell you.

25:19.723 --> 25:21.058
Sorry, J.T.

25:21.808 --> 25:25.979
Then he just started spitting it out,
like a goddamn machine.

25:27.773 --> 25:29.316
Scared me to death.

25:30.067 --> 25:31.860
Scared you to death?

25:34.613 --> 25:36.615
What did Bobby Earl tell you?

25:36.823 --> 25:39.910
About the bare-assed light bulb
at 4:00 a.m.?

25:40.243 --> 25:42.579
I beat on him with a rubber hose?

25:42.662 --> 25:44.247
How about a phone book?

25:46.041 --> 25:48.043
White pages or yellow pages?

25:50.754 --> 25:52.255
Mr. Armstrong?

25:54.925 --> 25:56.635
Now, you listen to me.

25:57.719 --> 26:00.930
Do you think if I'd gotten physical
with Bobby Earl...

26:01.222 --> 26:05.727
...he wouldn't be wearing my anger
all over him at that arraignment?

26:06.394 --> 26:08.938
What do you think, Professor?

26:10.940 --> 26:12.275
I'm impressed.

26:17.113 --> 26:18.781
You have a nice day now.

26:25.622 --> 26:28.416
Harvard University. Do tell.

26:29.083 --> 26:31.169
I'm a graduate of Florida State.

26:31.294 --> 26:32.503
Bobby Earl Ferguson.

26:34.297 --> 26:36.132
Change of venue, denied.

26:36.257 --> 26:38.926
Motion to suppress a confession, denied.

26:39.010 --> 26:41.179
Objection to an all-white jury, overruled.

26:41.262 --> 26:42.680
Noted for the record.

26:43.306 --> 26:46.059
I said, "You'll have to plead guilty,
take a 25-year hit.

26:46.142 --> 26:48.311
"You'll have a life left when you come out."

26:48.394 --> 26:51.147
He says, "But, sir, I didn't do it."

26:52.940 --> 26:55.485
So he made you go to trial?

26:58.404 --> 27:01.115
This matching blood statement
by Dr. Doliveau...

27:01.199 --> 27:02.867
...why didn't you challenge it?

27:03.701 --> 27:07.121
Even us backwoods
Florida State Law School alumni know...

27:07.204 --> 27:10.416
...that an O-positive match
doesn't mean anything...

27:10.499 --> 27:14.587
...unless you get genetic screening
or an enzyme-base analysis.

27:14.879 --> 27:17.798
You just narrowed it down
to 40 million suspects.

27:18.132 --> 27:21.260
How did this testimony
survive cross-examination?

27:21.635 --> 27:25.014
Half the people in the courtroom knew
that woman well.

27:25.931 --> 27:28.434
She's known here as a very fine physician.

27:30.227 --> 27:31.687
And a doctor is a god.

27:31.812 --> 27:33.105
You know that.

27:35.024 --> 27:35.941
Pathetic.

27:37.193 --> 27:38.819
Jury didn't care.

27:38.944 --> 27:43.282
I'll tell you, worst thing in that courtroom
was Bobby Earl himself.

27:44.033 --> 27:48.370
He sat there, day after day,
looking guilty as hell.

27:48.454 --> 27:50.080
It's not a popularity contest.

27:50.205 --> 27:53.542
I find that a naive statement, Counselor.

27:54.418 --> 27:56.670
Is that what you teach your law students:

27:56.879 --> 27:59.048
"The truth will prevail"?

28:00.049 --> 28:02.468
When's the last time you tried a case?

28:03.051 --> 28:04.762
It's been 25 years.

28:05.053 --> 28:06.847
Does that make you feel better?

28:08.265 --> 28:09.349
Hell.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.603
Hang dog, show dog,
I don't think it'd make any difference...

28:12.686 --> 28:16.648
...if Bobby Earl was
a 6'4" golden-haired Caucasian...

28:16.773 --> 28:21.737
...who just quarterbacked Florida State
past Miami, 62-0 in the Cotton Bowl.

28:23.155 --> 28:25.490
That jury won't disregard
the boy's own words.

28:26.158 --> 28:28.160
His confession was coerced.

28:28.618 --> 28:32.414
Why didn't you get an expert
to analyze his voice on tape?

28:32.539 --> 28:33.498
I tried, sir.

28:33.707 --> 28:34.916
Truly, I tried.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.044
I know my job, Mr. Armstrong.

28:37.127 --> 28:39.129
What you're not hearing is the fact...

28:39.379 --> 28:42.674
...that people were sick with grief
over that poor little girl.

28:42.966 --> 28:44.718
They wanted their revenge!

28:45.802 --> 28:47.304
The end.

28:51.766 --> 28:52.767
Mr. McNair.

28:53.685 --> 28:55.478
Many thanks for your time.

29:01.735 --> 29:03.236
No matter what you think...

29:03.320 --> 29:07.907
...I defended that boy pro bono because
everybody has a right to legal counsel.

29:08.491 --> 29:13.246
I paid for it dearly. I've lost half
my business because I tried to defend him.

29:13.329 --> 29:14.706
And he got the chair.

29:15.039 --> 29:18.626
Imagine what it'd be like for me here
if I'd gotten him acquitted.

29:35.602 --> 29:38.438
<i>We always have a teacher here
at 3:00 to make sure...</i>

29:38.521 --> 29:42.483
<i>... the boys don't get into horseplay
or the girls while away the afternoon...</i>

29:42.567 --> 29:44.694
...gossiping and giggling on the corner.

29:45.570 --> 29:47.113
Horseplay. Gossip.

29:47.196 --> 29:48.364
Sweet.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.743
That day it was about 3:10.

29:52.785 --> 29:54.704
Most everyone was gone.

29:55.455 --> 29:57.457
I saw her by the banyan tree.

29:57.915 --> 30:00.626
<i>She walked past the car, then turned...</i>

30:01.294 --> 30:03.796
...like someone in the car called her.

30:04.547 --> 30:06.340
She walked back...

30:07.466 --> 30:09.552
...and before she got in...

30:17.727 --> 30:18.728
God.

30:19.145 --> 30:22.356
I go to bed with this every night.
Her waving.

30:25.901 --> 30:28.738
The car was parked under that tree?

30:28.821 --> 30:30.322
Right like that there.

30:30.489 --> 30:31.907
That far away?

30:37.913 --> 30:41.792
When did the police show you the car
for identification?

30:42.209 --> 30:44.920
The police? They didn't.
They just showed me a photo.

30:46.255 --> 30:47.339
A photo?

30:48.173 --> 30:49.258
Really?

30:50.259 --> 30:52.136
- From what angle?
- Angle?

30:52.928 --> 30:54.471
Front, rear, side?

30:54.888 --> 30:56.056
Side.

30:58.976 --> 31:02.688
But you couldn't see the side from here.
Not if it was in that position.

31:03.063 --> 31:05.566
It seemed like the car to me.

31:06.024 --> 31:07.943
I was solid to myself when I said it.

31:08.485 --> 31:09.445
I understand.

31:09.528 --> 31:10.529
No, you don't!

31:13.449 --> 31:16.618
You're tearing open a wound, coming here.

31:17.828 --> 31:20.038
I'm only trying to get at what happened.

31:20.622 --> 31:22.624
I am sorry for your grief.

31:24.501 --> 31:26.169
Thanks for your time.

31:35.846 --> 31:36.972
Miss Conklin...

31:37.055 --> 31:39.016
...may I ask you one last question?

31:42.894 --> 31:44.396
What color is that car?

31:46.231 --> 31:47.399
Midnight blue.

31:47.482 --> 31:48.733
Midnight blue.

31:48.817 --> 31:51.611
Not dark blue? Black?

31:53.864 --> 31:54.906
Midnight blue.

31:55.490 --> 31:56.825
How can you be so sure?

31:57.784 --> 32:00.996
Because that's Tanny Brown's car.
Everyone knows that.

32:07.794 --> 32:08.670
Thank you.

32:21.141 --> 32:22.308
Come on in.

32:29.107 --> 32:30.024
Tanny Brown.

32:30.817 --> 32:31.860
Paul Armstrong.

32:33.528 --> 32:36.072
You're trying to get Robert Earl
off the Row?

32:36.155 --> 32:37.156
No.

32:37.782 --> 32:40.201
I'm just trying to get some information.

32:40.285 --> 32:41.369
Information?

32:44.080 --> 32:45.498
Well, fair enough.

32:47.417 --> 32:49.210
Let's get you some information.

32:54.006 --> 32:57.051
- The girl got into the car right here.
- I know.

32:57.385 --> 32:59.220
All right, fasten your seat belt.

33:07.061 --> 33:08.229
Watch carefully.

33:21.075 --> 33:23.327
Robert Earl made this right...

33:23.411 --> 33:26.414
...still headed towards the girl's house.

33:26.539 --> 33:28.916
See that house with the blue trim?

33:29.834 --> 33:31.168
That's hers.

33:31.335 --> 33:34.088
She'd wanted to go that way,
but he took her this way.

33:35.423 --> 33:37.258
That's where he popped her.

33:38.759 --> 33:41.846
He's a pretty son of a bitch, but he's mean.

33:42.805 --> 33:44.265
He's real mean.

33:52.481 --> 33:53.274
Scream!

33:54.233 --> 33:55.484
Scream!

33:56.986 --> 33:58.112
I can't breathe.

34:04.618 --> 34:08.330
Come on, big man like you.
You can scream louder than that.

34:10.123 --> 34:10.916
Stop!

34:15.795 --> 34:18.465
What the fuck was that nonsense about?

34:19.632 --> 34:21.802
Trying to get you some information.

34:25.097 --> 34:27.306
That is why you're here, right?

34:27.724 --> 34:31.018
You be careful.
You're way beyond your perimeters.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.940
Look around you, Mr. Armstrong.
Look where you are.

34:35.315 --> 34:37.400
You smack dab in the middle of hell.

34:37.525 --> 34:42.197
Took only five minutes to get here,
and nobody can hear you scream for help...

34:42.656 --> 34:44.908
...let alone an 11-year-old girl.

34:46.868 --> 34:48.453
Getting the picture?

34:48.620 --> 34:50.580
See it with Joanie Shriver's eyes?

34:50.664 --> 34:51.956
I get the point.

34:52.165 --> 34:53.750
You get the point?

34:55.210 --> 34:57.879
They come through here.
He was probably carrying her.

34:58.004 --> 35:00.632
No defensive wounds on her hands.

35:01.132 --> 35:03.927
We figure he knocked her out cold
in the car...

35:04.010 --> 35:06.179
...at the intersection near her house.

35:07.013 --> 35:09.224
Killed her while she was unconscious.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.435
Otherwise, we'd have...

35:12.686 --> 35:14.729
...seen stab wounds on her hands or...

35:15.897 --> 35:18.650
...some of his skin underneath her nails.

35:20.527 --> 35:21.569
This is it.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.489
This is the kill spot.

35:26.950 --> 35:31.287
The coroner said that the rape
was premortem, some of the cuts too.

35:33.456 --> 35:36.918
But he did a lot of damage to her
after she was dead.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.172
It's like he just went stone crazy.

35:43.049 --> 35:45.635
He pushed her body in the water...

35:46.135 --> 35:48.137
...and covered her up with some brush.

35:52.600 --> 35:55.144
Want you to meet Joanie Shriver.

35:57.063 --> 35:58.272
Take a look.

36:18.918 --> 36:19.752
Daddy!

36:20.002 --> 36:21.295
<i>I'll get Mommy.</i>

36:21.379 --> 36:23.381
No, don't get Mommy just yet.

36:25.925 --> 36:28.552
<i>I've been thinking about you
all day, sweetheart.</i>

36:29.470 --> 36:30.805
I love you very much.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.306
I love you too.

36:32.473 --> 36:34.100
<i>Can you come back tonight?</i>

36:34.225 --> 36:35.226
No.

36:35.351 --> 36:36.894
<i>I can't come back tonight.</i>

36:37.645 --> 36:39.772
So I want you to sleep with Mommy.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.774
Daddy, I'm too old for that.

36:41.941 --> 36:44.151
It's not for you, it's for her.

36:44.819 --> 36:46.237
<i>Do it for me.</i>

36:47.488 --> 36:48.906
I'll do it for you.

36:49.573 --> 36:50.658
Good girl.

36:50.908 --> 36:51.909
I love you.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.161
I love you too.

37:32.074 --> 37:33.033
Damn!

37:33.867 --> 37:38.080
They hate long stories
about how you messed up their vehicles.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.459
I hope you took that insurance option.

37:45.712 --> 37:48.215
I like them lightning bolts, though.

37:48.882 --> 37:49.883
Hell...

37:50.050 --> 37:52.636
...you might not want to paint this over.

37:53.553 --> 37:55.138
I know I wouldn't.

38:02.729 --> 38:05.732
What do we got to do
to get rid of you, Mr. Armstrong?

38:06.107 --> 38:09.027
Convince me that Bobby Earl
deserves to die.

38:11.571 --> 38:14.115
Under the circumstances,
that's not possible.

38:14.241 --> 38:16.368
So I'm not going to waste time trying.

38:17.702 --> 38:19.454
I do have a question for you.

38:19.913 --> 38:24.000
Are you aware that he was picked up
on kidnap charges in Dade County...

38:24.084 --> 38:27.003
...a year prior to his arrest
for Joanie Shriver's murder?

38:27.253 --> 38:29.089
Case went all the way to trial.

38:29.923 --> 38:32.842
Yeah, I bet "Mr. Victim" forgot
to tell you about that.

38:34.010 --> 38:35.720
And what was the result?

38:38.389 --> 38:42.268
Prosecution's case collapsed
on a technicality, I believe.

38:44.229 --> 38:46.397
Acquitted or thrown out of court?

38:50.109 --> 38:51.444
Look, Armstrong...

38:52.403 --> 38:55.406
...I knew Robert Earl was bad news
when I first saw him.

38:56.449 --> 38:59.744
See him hanging around the school
when I'd pick up my girls.

39:00.453 --> 39:04.582
Hanging around with his pretty-boy looks
and college-boy words.

39:04.791 --> 39:06.125
He just felt wrong.

39:06.209 --> 39:09.337
Wasn't just me who felt that way.
Every man in this department.

39:09.420 --> 39:12.799
- Everybody in town.
- I still don't hear any evidence.

39:15.134 --> 39:16.594
We didn't need any.

39:17.678 --> 39:18.888
We had a confession.

39:19.305 --> 39:20.932
If that's a confession...

39:21.015 --> 39:22.433
...my ass is a banjo.

39:22.517 --> 39:27.104
Damn arrogant Yankee son of a bitch!
He did it, goddamn it!

39:28.397 --> 39:29.982
That man is an asshole!

39:30.066 --> 39:31.817
Just calm the hell down.

39:33.986 --> 39:38.616
You tell me that man never laid a hand
on Bobby Earl in 22 hours?

39:38.991 --> 39:40.534
He slapped him once or twice.

39:40.785 --> 39:42.286
Which was it?

39:42.495 --> 39:46.332
You and I both know
it wasn't a textbook confession.

39:47.458 --> 39:49.460
But it was enough to convict him!

39:49.668 --> 39:52.087
This case hangs together by a thin thread.

39:52.838 --> 39:56.967
You come down here, you start picking
at them threads, it'll fall apart.

39:58.260 --> 39:59.512
I don't want that.

40:00.596 --> 40:02.264
I tell you something else.

40:02.431 --> 40:05.267
I want to see Robert Earl go to the chair
for what he did.

40:08.854 --> 40:13.525
Tell me, what is your policy on taking guns
into the interrogation room?

40:15.110 --> 40:16.445
Very simple: We don't.

40:17.863 --> 40:19.239
May I see your left ankle?

40:21.325 --> 40:22.367
Please?

40:27.039 --> 40:28.499
Looking for this?

40:29.458 --> 40:31.543
I checked it with the duty sergeant.

40:33.045 --> 40:34.379
You didn't take it out?

40:34.796 --> 40:36.548
Point it at Bobby Earl?

40:37.466 --> 40:38.717
No, sir.

40:40.010 --> 40:43.889
You didn't stick it in his mouth
and play Russian roulette?

40:46.308 --> 40:47.225
No, sir.

40:48.852 --> 40:51.104
Then how did I know where to look for it?

41:06.119 --> 41:07.370
You're back.

41:07.537 --> 41:08.955
Let's get started.

41:11.416 --> 41:13.627
Why didn't you tell me about your run-ins?

41:14.085 --> 41:15.253
What run-ins?

41:16.046 --> 41:18.256
Those times when Tanny tried to bust me?

41:18.465 --> 41:19.674
Come on.

41:19.758 --> 41:22.844
Tanny Brown had nothing to do
with your arrest in Dade County.

41:22.969 --> 41:24.220
Dade County?

41:26.139 --> 41:27.599
The charge was kidnapping.

41:29.392 --> 41:30.727
That was bullshit.

41:30.935 --> 41:34.022
Bullshit. I took some white girl
for a ride in my car.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.523
It was just a ride.

41:35.732 --> 41:37.692
In fact, she asked me for that ride.

41:37.776 --> 41:40.528
The arresting cracker happened
to be a boyfriend of hers.

41:40.612 --> 41:42.614
It should've been thrown out of court.

41:45.617 --> 41:48.286
My life was different after that.

41:49.454 --> 41:50.330
How?

41:53.499 --> 41:58.046
How was your life different after that,
if the case was thrown out?

42:00.632 --> 42:02.383
They took away my scholarship.

42:03.468 --> 42:05.803
A scholarship, for someone like me...

42:05.887 --> 42:08.139
...is a trade-off, pure and simple.

42:08.389 --> 42:11.059
I get a free ride, they get a better image.

42:11.559 --> 42:15.646
As soon as I walked into court,
I couldn't live up to my end of the bargain.

42:15.897 --> 42:17.482
They felt justified.

42:19.358 --> 42:22.570
The same way Tanny felt justified
looking for me...

42:22.653 --> 42:23.446
Wait.

42:24.489 --> 42:25.781
I don't follow you.

42:29.952 --> 42:32.622
Imagine a man, a very bad man...

42:32.955 --> 42:36.334
...driving a car south,
driving off the turnpike into Ochopee.

42:36.584 --> 42:37.668
He stops...

42:37.752 --> 42:41.464
...takes a siesta under a banyan tree
just outside a schoolyard.

42:43.132 --> 42:44.717
Then he spots a little girl.

42:45.384 --> 42:46.761
Pretty little girl.

42:47.345 --> 42:51.015
He talks her into his car.
He's friendly when he needs to be.

42:51.390 --> 42:52.475
Then he does it.

42:53.059 --> 42:55.102
Right there in the Glades.

42:55.186 --> 42:57.897
He drives on and never gives it
another thought.

43:00.357 --> 43:01.233
Go on.

43:01.317 --> 43:04.069
That very bad man moves on
down the line.

43:04.153 --> 43:05.571
A waitress in the Keys...

43:05.654 --> 43:09.408
...two tourists in Lakeland,
a prostitute in Tampa, and finally...

43:09.783 --> 43:11.201
...he gets sloppy.

43:11.410 --> 43:12.912
Big-time sloppy.

43:14.371 --> 43:15.873
That's murder one.

43:16.415 --> 43:18.500
That's the Row. Death Row.

43:19.752 --> 43:20.711
He's here?

43:20.794 --> 43:23.464
Yes. And what does he find
when he gets here?

43:23.881 --> 43:27.009
A neighbor on the Row
who's in for killing a little girl.

43:27.134 --> 43:30.304
Yeah, a little blonde girl down in Ochopee.

43:30.429 --> 43:32.723
All cut up and thrown in the swamps.

43:32.806 --> 43:33.807
And he says:

43:33.974 --> 43:36.268
"I know you didn't do it, because I did."

43:38.061 --> 43:39.605
Then he starts laughing.

43:39.855 --> 43:43.108
And he says, "You must be
the sorriest fuck in this unit."

43:45.110 --> 43:46.695
I can hear him every night.

43:47.404 --> 43:49.740
Bobby Earl!

43:59.291 --> 44:00.876
Why won't you talk to me?

44:05.630 --> 44:08.091
Shut up, you crazy fuck!

44:09.342 --> 44:10.927
Shut up!

44:11.636 --> 44:14.306
It's like a death sentence
on top of a death sentence.

44:15.432 --> 44:16.933
He calls me his last victim.

44:18.351 --> 44:19.477
Who is he?

44:24.774 --> 44:26.234
Blair Sullivan.

44:44.002 --> 44:45.670
You really had me going.

44:46.171 --> 44:47.589
I was starting to think:

44:47.672 --> 44:49.674
"Maybe the man is onto something."

44:50.467 --> 44:51.593
What do you mean?

44:51.676 --> 44:55.388
Funny thing is, you almost pulled it off,
you almost got away with it.

44:56.014 --> 44:57.182
Got away with what?

44:58.057 --> 44:59.267
Your wife, Slick.

45:00.351 --> 45:02.520
"Prentiss" is her maiden name, isn't it?

45:03.563 --> 45:04.606
Yes. Was.

45:05.315 --> 45:06.899
Was before she married you.

45:07.025 --> 45:09.277
Laurie Prentiss, Assistant DA.

45:10.028 --> 45:11.029
What about her?

45:12.363 --> 45:16.367
She was the prosecutor on Robert Earl's
kidnap trial in Dade. Ring any bells?

45:19.537 --> 45:21.205
What you think?

45:21.831 --> 45:24.375
Small-town police
don't do their homework?

45:24.459 --> 45:26.377
Don't know how to access information?

45:27.545 --> 45:31.966
I don't understand exactly what kind of
hidden agenda you got up your sleeve...

45:32.216 --> 45:33.843
...but I'm telling you...

45:34.218 --> 45:35.678
...stay out of my town.

45:49.108 --> 45:52.778
I'd been plea bargaining everything
that came across my desk.

45:52.903 --> 45:56.157
I just wanted to show
the good old boys how good I was.

45:56.240 --> 45:59.535
I was hot for it.
Thought I had the case locked tight.

45:59.618 --> 46:02.288
My star witness, the arresting officer.

46:03.247 --> 46:07.042
He said when he came up on the car,
that Bobby Earl was on top of her...

46:07.126 --> 46:09.920
...in the back seat and she was screaming.

46:11.130 --> 46:13.424
Two seconds into the cross-examination...

46:13.507 --> 46:16.594
...the defense attorney produces
a prom photo...

46:16.969 --> 46:19.763
...with my star witness in a tuxedo
with the victim.

46:19.847 --> 46:22.599
Son of a bitch admits
they were high school sweethearts!

46:22.766 --> 46:24.768
I didn't want to give up, so...

46:25.311 --> 46:29.648
...I got the judge to grant me
a 24-hour recess so I could regroup.

46:31.900 --> 46:34.945
I came back with nothing
and he threw the case out.

46:36.488 --> 46:38.240
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

46:38.782 --> 46:40.826
I did. I told you when I met you.

46:40.993 --> 46:41.827
Bullshit.

46:43.287 --> 46:45.289
Should've told me
when you read the letter.

46:47.374 --> 46:49.126
- I didn't...
- Why not?

46:50.419 --> 46:53.255
I didn't know if it would influence you.

46:55.215 --> 46:59.136
That you might not take the case,
you might not help this kid.

47:00.053 --> 47:02.556
He paid dearly for what happened to him.

47:02.723 --> 47:06.393
Why? Because he lost a scholarship
and spent an extra night in prison?

47:06.852 --> 47:07.936
No, Paul.

47:08.353 --> 47:09.855
It was more than that.

47:11.064 --> 47:14.651
Later, I found out that they beat him
real bad that night.

47:14.943 --> 47:16.945
He ended up in the hospital.

47:17.988 --> 47:18.822
Listen.

47:19.239 --> 47:20.448
It was my fault.

47:22.993 --> 47:25.912
I want you to help him get his life back.

47:25.996 --> 47:28.665
I want you to make it right for him.

47:28.832 --> 47:32.002
No, Laurie, you want me
to make it right for you.

47:33.712 --> 47:35.005
You're right.

47:36.256 --> 47:40.510
But how does what I'm telling you
change his situation on Death Row?

47:51.646 --> 47:52.730
Okay.

47:59.362 --> 48:03.032
<i>It was called "The Pilgrimage of Death."
It sold many papers.</i>

48:03.283 --> 48:06.202
<i>The guy started with his landlady
in New Orleans...</i>

48:06.327 --> 48:09.581
<i>... a prostitute in Mobile
and a sailor in Pensacola.</i>

48:09.706 --> 48:11.666
Then he got real busy.

48:11.874 --> 48:14.252
A body every 100 miles.

48:14.502 --> 48:15.837
When was Pensacola?

48:18.506 --> 48:20.049
Late April, early May.

48:20.299 --> 48:21.467
It was incredible.

48:21.759 --> 48:25.388
APBs in three states,
FBI flyers all over the place...

48:25.471 --> 48:27.390
...and no one spots him.

48:30.017 --> 48:32.895
Painting, writing letters
to the families of his victims...

48:32.979 --> 48:34.564
...that's all he does.

48:35.314 --> 48:39.652
Yeah, we got a whole other theme park
for Mr. Sullivan.

48:43.906 --> 48:45.908
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!

49:09.181 --> 49:10.432
All right...

49:11.267 --> 49:12.643
...he's all yours.

49:18.274 --> 49:20.359
They don't like me very much.

49:20.818 --> 49:21.986
Really?

49:22.152 --> 49:23.612
Why is that?

49:24.780 --> 49:25.990
Creative differences.

49:29.618 --> 49:31.078
Tape recorder. May I?

49:32.079 --> 49:33.080
Be my guest.

49:35.249 --> 49:37.459
You have quite an art gallery back there.

49:38.001 --> 49:38.961
Thank you.

49:39.378 --> 49:41.255
Idle hands are the devil's workshop.

49:46.260 --> 49:47.511
You believe in Jesus?

49:48.554 --> 49:50.180
Yes, I do.

49:50.722 --> 49:51.723
That's good.

49:52.599 --> 49:53.851
That's very good.

49:55.769 --> 49:58.355
I killed so many goddamn people...

49:58.522 --> 50:02.693
...I can't keep up with my correspondence,
but my question is:

50:03.485 --> 50:07.739
Do you think any of those people
got out of bed on their last day...

50:07.990 --> 50:10.283
...thinking, "Today's my day to die"?

50:10.826 --> 50:14.705
You got to take Jesus into your heart now,
because you never know.

50:16.415 --> 50:20.043
Even if you don't have a condition,
you might have a situation.

50:21.878 --> 50:23.046
You a killer too?

50:23.255 --> 50:24.422
Me?

50:24.548 --> 50:25.215
No.

50:25.799 --> 50:27.092
You never went to war?

50:28.718 --> 50:30.136
Korea? Vietnam?

50:31.054 --> 50:33.515
Never did a hit-and-run with the BMW?

50:35.475 --> 50:37.644
Never told the wifey to get an abortion?

50:37.852 --> 50:41.982
Or that piece of chicken on the side,
"Here's $300, take care of it."

50:44.192 --> 50:45.694
Because you got that look.

50:47.779 --> 50:48.988
You got ice in your eyes.

50:51.908 --> 50:52.909
I can tell.

50:54.119 --> 50:55.203
You're wrong.

50:56.579 --> 50:57.580
Am I now?

51:01.501 --> 51:03.002
Mr. Armstrong...

51:05.380 --> 51:07.465
...let's see whom we're talking to.

51:08.091 --> 51:09.217
Are you married?

51:10.635 --> 51:11.511
Yes.

51:12.303 --> 51:13.179
Kids?

51:14.180 --> 51:14.973
No.

51:15.598 --> 51:16.641
Liar.

51:17.684 --> 51:19.185
House or apartment?

51:19.936 --> 51:20.937
A house.

51:21.270 --> 51:23.022
Alarms on the windows?

51:23.106 --> 51:23.773
Dogs?

51:24.399 --> 51:25.692
Have trouble sleeping?

51:26.567 --> 51:28.236
- No.
- Liar.

51:29.779 --> 51:31.280
You afraid to die?

51:31.948 --> 51:33.199
Don't think about it.

51:33.282 --> 51:33.950
Liar!

51:34.575 --> 51:36.077
That's three lies.

51:36.619 --> 51:39.497
Same as Peter did to Jesus
before the cock crowed.

51:39.789 --> 51:42.792
You should be ashamed of yourself,
lying to a condemned man.

51:43.292 --> 51:44.460
Don't my...

51:44.627 --> 51:47.838
...lies tell you as much about me
as my truths?

51:56.013 --> 51:57.181
Okay.

52:04.063 --> 52:06.899
Would you do me a favor?
Mail this for me.

52:08.984 --> 52:10.027
Thank you.

52:15.574 --> 52:18.160
What do you want to talk to me for?

52:20.162 --> 52:21.330
Ochopee.

52:22.998 --> 52:24.208
Nice town.

52:24.792 --> 52:26.293
What happened there?

52:26.669 --> 52:30.506
You been talking to my old neighbor,
Bobby Earl. Excitable boy.

52:31.507 --> 52:33.092
Did you kill Joanie Shriver?

52:35.678 --> 52:36.762
Did I?

52:38.222 --> 52:39.556
There been so many.

52:40.391 --> 52:42.685
Did you kill Joanie Shriver?

52:42.768 --> 52:46.563
You're starting to get all frantic
and excited, just like Bobby Earl did.

52:46.647 --> 52:47.481
Did you?

52:47.731 --> 52:51.819
You're my first visitor in two years since
those behavioral science boys visited me.

52:51.902 --> 52:53.862
Wanted to know about my childhood.

52:54.029 --> 52:56.615
Did my folks beat me,
abuse me, sex me up?

52:57.157 --> 53:00.035
I told them there ain't no formula
for people like me.

53:00.160 --> 53:04.206
What we're dealing with here
is just a predisposition for an appetite.

53:04.498 --> 53:07.626
You know, good parents, bad parents...

53:08.377 --> 53:11.171
Ain't no cause and effect.
It's just an appetite.

53:12.798 --> 53:13.715
Fuck you.

53:13.799 --> 53:16.718
Let me tell you a few things, Armstrong.
One:

53:16.802 --> 53:18.804
I am filled with power!

53:19.346 --> 53:21.932
You may think I'm an impotent prisoner...

53:22.015 --> 53:25.894
...locked in a cell each night and day,
but I am filled with a strength...

53:26.061 --> 53:28.396
...that reaches beyond these bars!

53:29.064 --> 53:30.732
I can touch anyone I want to!

53:30.899 --> 53:33.568
Just as easy as dialing the telephone!

53:35.737 --> 53:39.282
There's no one beyond my reach!
You hear me? No one!

53:39.783 --> 53:40.825
Did you kill her?

53:40.909 --> 53:43.703
I ain't going to tell you if I did or not.

53:45.330 --> 53:47.832
Even if I did, how would you know
to believe me?

53:48.208 --> 53:51.211
Killing is easy for me.
How hard do you think lying is?

53:51.586 --> 53:53.046
Yeah. Go to hell.

53:53.672 --> 53:54.839
I will.

53:54.923 --> 53:56.466
No doubt about that.

53:58.301 --> 54:00.595
What if I could help you find something?

54:01.888 --> 54:03.264
Something important.

54:04.933 --> 54:06.392
Something interesting.

54:06.476 --> 54:07.936
Real important.

54:08.603 --> 54:09.604
Like what?

54:22.075 --> 54:22.951
Where is it?

54:23.034 --> 54:25.620
- Not far from where they found her.
- Where?

54:25.954 --> 54:27.455
They didn't read the signs.

54:27.664 --> 54:28.414
What signs?

54:28.498 --> 54:29.332
The Bible.

54:29.874 --> 54:30.875
The Bible?

54:31.167 --> 54:33.795
Ecclesiastes 11:1.

54:34.796 --> 54:37.673
You can't miss it if you can read the signs.

54:37.882 --> 54:38.800
What signs?

54:38.883 --> 54:41.344
"Seek, and ye shall find."

55:02.823 --> 55:07.495
- Do you have a Bible here?
- We have plenty. The Gideons love us.

55:08.954 --> 55:12.208
- How'd it go?
- I wouldn't like him as a neighbor.

55:13.626 --> 55:16.796
- He asked me to mail this.
- Not again. Goddamn him.

55:18.714 --> 55:20.049
Wilkinsons.

55:20.216 --> 55:21.383
Sick bastard.

55:21.467 --> 55:24.720
I never send these letters.
Can't even read them anymore.

55:25.721 --> 55:28.307
Hey, Roz, what's up, baby?

55:28.641 --> 55:30.559
You saw Tyrone?

55:30.976 --> 55:34.271
He is not telling you the truth.
You know he's lying.

55:34.355 --> 55:36.690
I saw him with her last night.

55:36.982 --> 55:41.236
Someone is here so I'll speak to you later.
All right, then.

55:46.241 --> 55:47.493
Hi.

55:47.743 --> 55:49.078
Is Tanny Brown here?

55:49.161 --> 55:51.413
He's at a soccer practice with my brother.

55:51.497 --> 55:52.748
Hi. I'm Lena.

55:53.749 --> 55:56.668
- You must be Mr. Armstrong.
- Yeah? How do you know?

55:56.835 --> 56:01.006
Everyone knows you're the guy
my father was complaining about.

56:01.215 --> 56:02.925
He'll be back in a few minutes.

56:03.008 --> 56:04.760
Would you care for some iced tea?

56:04.843 --> 56:07.387
- That would be very nice.
- Come in.

56:24.112 --> 56:26.114
I'm going to study law too.

56:26.615 --> 56:29.367
I graduated first in my high school class.

56:29.743 --> 56:31.203
Good for you.

56:31.286 --> 56:34.623
I'm thinking about going
to the University of Virginia.

56:34.790 --> 56:38.126
They have a great school
and my mom lives in Newport News.

56:50.639 --> 56:52.140
That's Joanie and me.

56:52.223 --> 56:54.559
Daddy used to call us his girls.

56:55.977 --> 57:00.815
I remember how we used to talk
about opening up a pet shop together.

57:01.733 --> 57:02.817
I miss her.

57:04.152 --> 57:07.155
A day doesn't go by
that I still don't talk to her.

57:07.280 --> 57:08.281
To who?

57:17.749 --> 57:20.668
- Maurice, go wash up for supper.
- But, Daddy...

57:20.752 --> 57:22.670
Go! Is supper ready?

57:23.504 --> 57:26.674
Take Mr. Armstrong's glass.
He was just leaving.

57:29.928 --> 57:31.679
Get out of my house.

57:32.180 --> 57:33.848
You shouldn't have been in charge.

57:33.931 --> 57:36.351
- I'll have you arrested!
- Too close to the victim.

57:36.434 --> 57:39.062
You got no right coming here
and interrogating my kids!

57:39.145 --> 57:42.648
You got no right telling me
how to do my job!

57:42.940 --> 57:46.694
How many times did she eat here,
or sleep over with Lena?

57:46.861 --> 57:48.613
Look, I got an office.

57:48.780 --> 57:51.282
What you come around here for?

57:51.449 --> 57:54.952
I thought you might be interested
in recovering the knife.

57:55.036 --> 57:57.455
All of a sudden you're Sherlock Holmes?

57:57.872 --> 57:59.624
You're obviously not.

58:49.923 --> 58:51.091
Any luck?

58:54.511 --> 58:59.349
"Cast thy bread upon the waters,
for thou shalt find it after many days."

58:59.516 --> 59:02.686
Ecclesiastes 11:1.

59:03.771 --> 59:05.939
Blair Sullivan's directions.

59:06.106 --> 59:07.608
Blair Sullivan?

59:07.858 --> 59:11.195
"And if the tree fall toward the south
or toward the north...

59:11.278 --> 59:14.698
"...in the place where the tree falleth,
there it shall be."

59:15.616 --> 59:18.619
Yeah, you're really onto something now,
Armstrong.

59:20.037 --> 59:21.872
Really onto something.

59:23.290 --> 59:24.374
Look here...

59:24.708 --> 59:27.044
How you come to Blair Sullivan?

59:27.711 --> 59:29.379
It's a long story.

59:29.546 --> 59:30.714
Look around you.

59:31.381 --> 59:32.716
Look where you at.

59:34.134 --> 59:35.886
- You see where you are?
- Yes.

59:38.722 --> 59:40.724
"Seek and ye shall find."

59:42.976 --> 59:46.479
Sullivan must have bust a gut
the minute he saw you coming.

59:46.563 --> 59:48.231
Talking about the Bible.

59:50.984 --> 59:51.985
Look...

59:52.485 --> 59:53.904
...we must've had...

59:54.070 --> 59:56.323
...50, 60 volunteers...

59:56.573 --> 59:59.242
...poking and digging through here...

59:59.826 --> 01:00:02.078
...trying to find that knife.

01:00:03.413 --> 01:00:04.664
What's this?

01:00:04.914 --> 01:00:09.169
That's a culvert. They run under the roads.
Keep them from washing away.

01:00:12.422 --> 01:00:15.258
- What the hell was that?
- That's the local wildlife.

01:00:19.596 --> 01:00:23.099
There's a couple hundred of them here,
if you want to keep looking.

01:00:29.772 --> 01:00:31.900
Do people live in a place like that?

01:00:31.983 --> 01:00:33.234
Hell, no.

01:00:33.526 --> 01:00:36.237
An old poacher's shack,
what they call a hunting blind.

01:00:36.321 --> 01:00:38.156
It's a camp for gator hunters.

01:00:38.448 --> 01:00:42.869
Do the skinning there, rest up
in the evening. It's a nighttime thing.

01:00:58.468 --> 01:01:00.678
What the hell is he doing now?

01:01:12.481 --> 01:01:13.316
What now?

01:01:13.399 --> 01:01:16.402
Look at this: One, one, one.

01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:18.070
What about it?

01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:20.489
Sullivan said we have to read the signs.

01:01:22.324 --> 01:01:24.910
Eleven-one. Chapter eleven, verse one.

01:01:25.661 --> 01:01:27.204
You're a real hard case.

01:01:27.288 --> 01:01:28.581
You know that?

01:01:29.749 --> 01:01:31.917
You're fishing! Nothing's out here!

01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:33.919
You're fishing!

01:01:35.337 --> 01:01:36.839
The man's an idiot!

01:01:44.763 --> 01:01:46.181
Goddamn it!

01:01:46.348 --> 01:01:48.267
How about this?

01:01:49.768 --> 01:01:52.104
North, south. South, north.

01:01:52.604 --> 01:01:53.939
That's a tree.

01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:57.192
Make your point.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:13.125
Step down here, please.

01:02:14.626 --> 01:02:17.462
I've just about run out of patience
with you.

01:02:17.629 --> 01:02:18.630
Step down.

01:02:19.089 --> 01:02:20.299
I hope this is good.

01:02:20.883 --> 01:02:22.134
Pick that up.

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.845
Is something wrong with your hands?

01:02:25.554 --> 01:02:28.056
No, but if it is the murder weapon...

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.727
...technically it's better
to be discovered by the police.

01:02:33.145 --> 01:02:34.312
I see.

01:02:40.235 --> 01:02:44.072
That way we won't jeopardize
my legal position.

01:02:47.576 --> 01:02:49.077
Thank you, Professor.

01:03:19.899 --> 01:03:21.276
Goddamn!

01:03:22.068 --> 01:03:25.905
Goddamn you, Armstrong.
You got a lot of explaining to do.

01:03:26.072 --> 01:03:27.448
Sullivan...

01:03:27.615 --> 01:03:30.243
...all but admitted that he killed the girl...

01:03:30.785 --> 01:03:33.454
...without anyone sticking a gun
in his mouth.

01:03:35.123 --> 01:03:37.917
Fuck Blair Sullivan and fuck you too!

01:03:38.626 --> 01:03:40.587
No! Rejoice!

01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:43.881
For a great injustice is about to be undone!

01:04:00.857 --> 01:04:02.066
<i>What did Sullivan drive?</i>

01:04:04.777 --> 01:04:05.987
Three cars.

01:04:07.446 --> 01:04:08.281
All stolen.

01:04:08.489 --> 01:04:10.449
What was he driving in Florida?

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.161
Green Monarch.

01:04:14.245 --> 01:04:15.079
Damn.

01:04:15.997 --> 01:04:17.331
We need a Ford Granada.

01:04:20.001 --> 01:04:21.794
I see your Monarch...

01:04:22.461 --> 01:04:24.296
...I raise you Bobby Earl's...

01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:25.798
...Granada.

01:04:28.968 --> 01:04:30.386
They're almost identical.

01:04:38.727 --> 01:04:41.063
I'm no friend of capital punishment...

01:04:41.939 --> 01:04:44.066
...but at least the letters will stop.

01:05:00.666 --> 01:05:03.168
More of Sullivan's correspondence.

01:05:04.086 --> 01:05:05.337
That's the lot?

01:05:05.421 --> 01:05:06.672
So far.

01:05:25.774 --> 01:05:26.858
Warden.

01:05:41.289 --> 01:05:43.792
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Shriver...

01:05:44.126 --> 01:05:46.628
"...I've been wrong not to write sooner...

01:05:46.711 --> 01:05:49.589
"...but I've been real busy
getting ready to die.

01:05:50.632 --> 01:05:53.426
"I just wanted you to know what a real...

01:05:55.887 --> 01:05:57.806
"...sweet piece of business...

01:05:58.557 --> 01:06:00.517
"...your little baby was.

01:06:01.643 --> 01:06:03.144
"Doing her...

01:06:03.645 --> 01:06:05.897
"...was like carving up...

01:06:06.565 --> 01:06:07.732
"...a ripe melon...

01:06:08.733 --> 01:06:12.028
"...like picking ripe cherries
on a summer morning...

01:06:12.737 --> 01:06:15.657
"...like plowing a scented field,
and plow her I did.

01:06:16.074 --> 01:06:20.245
"But I don't imagine anything will come
of that particular crop...

01:06:20.412 --> 01:06:22.664
"...come harvest time, do you?"

01:06:24.165 --> 01:06:25.792
It's signed, "Your friend...

01:06:26.167 --> 01:06:27.544
"...Blair Sullivan."

01:06:30.755 --> 01:06:31.756
Now...

01:06:33.258 --> 01:06:35.468
...he doesn't specifically...

01:06:35.927 --> 01:06:39.347
...say in this letter that he killed
Joanie Shriver.

01:06:40.348 --> 01:06:41.349
Does he?

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:42.850
No.

01:06:44.394 --> 01:06:45.937
He said what I read.

01:06:46.604 --> 01:06:49.273
That being with her was "like carving up...

01:06:49.607 --> 01:06:51.109
"...a ripe melon."

01:06:58.533 --> 01:06:59.617
Nothing further.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:12.713
How does freedom feel?

01:07:12.797 --> 01:07:14.465
- I'd like to thank...
- Your attorney.

01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:16.384
...my attorney, Mr. Lyle Morgan.

01:07:16.467 --> 01:07:20.054
My grandma for never giving up hope,
and Professor Paul Armstrong.

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:22.139
Without him, I wouldn't be here.

01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:46.497
How are you?

01:07:46.831 --> 01:07:48.833
I'm very happy for you.

01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:51.502
I'm happy for both of us.

01:07:53.003 --> 01:07:54.004
Professor.

01:07:55.506 --> 01:07:56.507
Thank you.

01:07:57.258 --> 01:07:58.592
Before we go back...

01:07:58.759 --> 01:08:00.177
...come for drinks Friday.

01:08:00.678 --> 01:08:01.679
I'd love to...

01:08:01.762 --> 01:08:04.139
...but I can't. I made other plans.

01:08:04.306 --> 01:08:05.349
We'll meet again.

01:08:05.641 --> 01:08:06.934
I promise you.

01:08:07.976 --> 01:08:09.436
- You ready?
- Congratulations.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.854
Have a safe trip.

01:08:13.065 --> 01:08:15.025
Hey, Mr. Ferguson. Congratulations.

01:08:16.026 --> 01:08:18.862
Got them all fooled, don't you? Judge...

01:08:19.654 --> 01:08:21.698
...even that know-nothing Harvard fool.

01:08:22.282 --> 01:08:23.283
But not me.

01:08:24.952 --> 01:08:25.702
No, sir.

01:08:26.161 --> 01:08:27.787
Not Tanny Brown.

01:08:27.955 --> 01:08:30.207
I'll be all over you like white on rice.

01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:31.542
You hear?

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:35.295
Come on.

01:08:35.837 --> 01:08:36.921
Miss Evangeline.

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:52.562
"But they all disappear

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:55.982
"From view

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:03.406
"'Cause I only have eyes for you"

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.412
I love you.

01:09:34.145 --> 01:09:37.564
The firm's been more successful
than I dreamed.

01:09:38.024 --> 01:09:39.776
Are you single?

01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:41.778
I've been married for eight years.

01:09:41.861 --> 01:09:44.279
Good. It's time for you to fool around.

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:46.491
Champagne, anyone?

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:49.993
Yes, I'd love some. Thank you, Phil.

01:09:50.536 --> 01:09:54.122
You ought to stay a few days
and make it a real vacation.

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:58.544
No, we must get back. I'm behind
on my caseload. Paul has classes.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:01.547
Paul, I think you missed your true calling.

01:10:01.673 --> 01:10:03.466
You should've been a detective.

01:10:03.549 --> 01:10:06.803
No, thanks. I'm quite happy
to get out of the real world.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:09.055
Here we go. A little refreshment.

01:10:10.681 --> 01:10:12.350
Katie, get the phone.

01:10:16.562 --> 01:10:19.649
I would like to propose a toast.

01:10:20.733 --> 01:10:22.693
To innocence revealed.

01:10:23.027 --> 01:10:24.737
To death denied.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.698
To the triumph of truth over appearance.

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:29.617
Hear, hear.

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:31.494
Telephone for you, Daddy.

01:10:32.244 --> 01:10:33.329
Don't finish it.

01:10:33.412 --> 01:10:34.872
What are you doing later?

01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:36.791
After the party?

01:10:36.874 --> 01:10:39.877
I have an appointment.
In fact, I must leave now.

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:45.466
<i>Congratulations, Professor.</i>

01:10:45.549 --> 01:10:46.550
Sullivan?

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:48.719
How'd you get this number?

01:10:50.054 --> 01:10:51.639
I've got all your numbers.

01:10:52.598 --> 01:10:54.600
<i>Been a big week for you.</i>

01:10:56.101 --> 01:10:57.853
Been a big week for me too.

01:10:58.103 --> 01:11:01.273
Sure you know the governor
signed my death warrant.

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:04.735
I got less time than it takes
to play a round of golf.

01:11:05.736 --> 01:11:06.737
<i>Anyways...</i>

01:11:08.614 --> 01:11:10.908
...my letter sewed it up tight for you.

01:11:11.408 --> 01:11:13.744
<i>We thought that might do the trick.</i>

01:11:13.827 --> 01:11:14.745
We?

01:11:16.455 --> 01:11:17.456
Who's "we"?

01:11:17.748 --> 01:11:19.208
<i>I'll tell you when you come.</i>

01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:22.086
<i>Things worked out kind of perfect
for you, didn't it?</i>

01:11:22.252 --> 01:11:23.504
<i>Maybe too perfect.</i>

01:11:24.338 --> 01:11:25.589
<i>You got a pen?</i>

01:11:28.759 --> 01:11:30.719
13 Tula Way.

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:34.431
Winterglade.

01:11:35.474 --> 01:11:37.267
My folks' place.

01:11:38.477 --> 01:11:40.479
I want you to call on them.

01:11:41.772 --> 01:11:44.107
I want you to say good-bye for me.

01:11:45.609 --> 01:11:47.694
Tell them I love them...

01:11:47.819 --> 01:11:49.821
...and that they are in my prayers...

01:11:51.365 --> 01:11:52.866
...and then you come to me.

01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:55.494
<i>You do that for me...</i>

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.913
<i>... and I'll tell you who "we" is.</i>

01:11:59.289 --> 01:12:01.291
You best run, Armstrong.

01:12:50.965 --> 01:12:51.966
Hello?

01:13:30.254 --> 01:13:31.672
Anyone home?

01:13:58.741 --> 01:14:01.035
<i>Takes me back to my youth.</i>

01:14:01.577 --> 01:14:04.914
<i>I want to remind you all
of next Sunday's fish fry.</i>

01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:10.878
<i>And now, from the bounty of the Lord...</i>

01:14:11.086 --> 01:14:14.757
<i>...Amazing Grace
on Everglade Christian Radio.</i>

01:15:26.661 --> 01:15:29.289
"So the dead which he slew at his death...

01:15:31.124 --> 01:15:33.835
"...were more than they
which he slew in his life."

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:36.838
Judges 16:30.

01:15:39.674 --> 01:15:41.301
I told you I had power.

01:15:45.472 --> 01:15:46.514
Not this time.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.354
So tell me...

01:15:54.397 --> 01:15:55.899
...what did you see?

01:15:56.858 --> 01:15:58.318
What did you hear?

01:16:00.528 --> 01:16:02.238
Give me all the details.

01:16:02.655 --> 01:16:04.532
Spare me nothing. Come on.

01:16:06.492 --> 01:16:08.202
Come on, I want everything.

01:16:11.622 --> 01:16:12.623
Come on.

01:16:12.832 --> 01:16:13.541
No.

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:17.378
When you called me to say:

01:16:18.212 --> 01:16:21.048
"We thought the letter
would do the trick"...

01:16:21.382 --> 01:16:23.050
...who did you mean by "we"?

01:16:26.345 --> 01:16:30.933
Tell me what you saw.
Tell me about my folks. That was the deal.

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:46.741
Okay.

01:16:47.408 --> 01:16:48.534
Why not?

01:16:51.412 --> 01:16:54.540
By "we," I meant me and the shining boy
of the hour.

01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:59.420
I pushed the buttons
to make you do the dance...

01:16:59.545 --> 01:17:01.422
...to spring our boy...

01:17:02.506 --> 01:17:04.300
...who, in turn, did the deed.

01:17:04.884 --> 01:17:05.968
"The deed"?

01:17:06.093 --> 01:17:07.595
You know what I mean.

01:17:09.388 --> 01:17:12.057
I had some unfinished business out there.

01:17:12.933 --> 01:17:14.894
I gave Bobby Earl life...

01:17:16.145 --> 01:17:18.272
...so he could give me death.

01:17:22.985 --> 01:17:24.403
Joanie Shriver?

01:17:28.198 --> 01:17:31.869
I never had the pleasure
of making her acquaintance.

01:17:32.411 --> 01:17:35.164
Bobby Earl coached me a little bit
on the details.

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:40.919
All I had to do to take his crime was
tell you where the knife was...

01:17:41.003 --> 01:17:42.504
...and write that letter.

01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:45.174
You should see your face, Armstrong!

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:47.968
What's going on up there?

01:17:50.596 --> 01:17:51.847
Why me?

01:17:52.014 --> 01:17:55.851
We needed a legitimizer.
Who'd believe us? We're just psychopaths.

01:17:56.018 --> 01:17:57.019
Why me?

01:17:57.144 --> 01:17:59.646
You were Bobby Earl's con.
And he had his reasons.

01:17:59.771 --> 01:18:00.772
Reasons?

01:18:00.856 --> 01:18:01.773
It's my turn.

01:18:01.857 --> 01:18:02.858
What reasons?

01:18:02.941 --> 01:18:04.192
No, it's my turn now!

01:18:04.651 --> 01:18:05.736
Come on.

01:18:06.194 --> 01:18:08.363
How did my folks look?

01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:11.199
How did they smell?

01:18:12.951 --> 01:18:14.411
Tell me everything.

01:18:14.619 --> 01:18:16.288
Spare me nothing.

01:18:20.542 --> 01:18:23.837
They said they forgive you
and will remember you in their prayers.

01:18:24.713 --> 01:18:25.380
No!

01:18:25.797 --> 01:18:26.798
Yeah.

01:18:26.965 --> 01:18:29.050
I'm sure you're lying, cocksucker!

01:18:29.509 --> 01:18:32.262
You inhuman bastard!
You cannot cheat me of this!

01:18:34.306 --> 01:18:35.557
Come on!

01:18:36.683 --> 01:18:39.060
We played you like a tune! It ain't over!

01:18:39.644 --> 01:18:41.813
You got the trials of Job ahead of you!

01:18:41.896 --> 01:18:46.776
The trials of Job! The sin is pride,
you fucker, and the messenger is revenge!

01:18:52.615 --> 01:18:55.535
<i>We played you like a tune!
It ain't over yet!</i>

01:19:20.977 --> 01:19:23.855
<i>- I told you how fragile this thing was.
- Yes, you're right.</i>

01:19:23.938 --> 01:19:26.232
<i>- You were right.
- You know where I am?</i>

01:19:26.315 --> 01:19:29.277
I'm at the Sullivan house now
and I want to tell you...

01:19:29.986 --> 01:19:32.321
<i>... it's a good thing I put Wilcox on his tail.</i>

01:19:45.793 --> 01:19:48.170
- "In the name of the Father, the Son..."
- Shut up!

01:19:48.254 --> 01:19:50.339
- "...and the Holy Spirit..."
- Shut up, please!

01:19:50.423 --> 01:19:51.590
Shut up!

01:19:57.888 --> 01:20:00.224
"As governor of the state of Florida..."

01:20:00.307 --> 01:20:04.145
I have a confession from Sullivan
on tape and it is evidence.

01:20:04.311 --> 01:20:06.147
<i>You're a goddamn fool.</i>

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.567
First you had evidence this way,
now you got evidence that way.

01:20:09.650 --> 01:20:13.362
<i>His confession don't mean shit
unless he testifies in court.</i>

01:20:13.445 --> 01:20:17.491
<i>Don't lecture me about confessions,
not after the way you got Bobby Earl's.</i>

01:20:18.409 --> 01:20:22.621
"To cause the sentence of death
to be executed on Blair Sullivan."

01:20:30.337 --> 01:20:33.007
<i>Armstrong, you keep Sullivan alive.</i>

01:20:40.848 --> 01:20:45.185
"Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

01:20:45.602 --> 01:20:50.357
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth, as it is in heaven.

01:20:51.483 --> 01:20:54.152
"Give us this day our daily bread.

01:20:54.528 --> 01:20:56.697
"And forgive us our trespasses."

01:21:05.872 --> 01:21:07.290
Are you packed?

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.710
Where are you?

01:21:10.085 --> 01:21:11.670
I'm right on top of him.

01:21:11.878 --> 01:21:13.672
Collins and 50th.

01:21:13.964 --> 01:21:17.884
I want you to stay on his tail,
but don't jump him until I tell you.

01:21:18.385 --> 01:21:19.636
10-4.

01:21:31.439 --> 01:21:34.442
<i>You were Bobby Earl's con.
And he had his reasons.</i>

01:21:34.734 --> 01:21:36.528
<i>- It's my turn.
- What reasons?</i>

01:21:36.611 --> 01:21:37.946
<i>No, it's my turn now!</i>

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:39.948
I'm sorry, there's no answer.

01:21:40.031 --> 01:21:42.283
Did she leave any messages for me?

01:21:42.367 --> 01:21:44.035
<i>Just one moment, sir.</i>

01:21:44.369 --> 01:21:48.415
<i>We played you like a tune! It ain't over!
You got the trials of Job ahead!</i>

01:21:48.581 --> 01:21:50.917
<i>The trials of Job! The sin is pride...</i>

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.587
<i>- Sorry, sir, no messages.
- ... and the messenger is revenge!</i>

01:22:13.147 --> 01:22:14.315
On, no, I left him!

01:22:14.732 --> 01:22:15.858
Angus!

01:22:15.942 --> 01:22:18.695
- Who?
- The bear Daddy gave me. I left him!

01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:22.198
- We gave the key back.
- We can't just leave him!

01:22:23.741 --> 01:22:25.827
Come on, we'll find a maid.

01:22:26.244 --> 01:22:28.579
Maybe she'll let us in the room.

01:22:58.025 --> 01:23:00.820
Don't let anyone touch that luggage.
All right?

01:23:01.529 --> 01:23:02.988
I'll be right back.

01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:16.168
I got to call Mom and Dad.

01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.462
- Did I get the laundry?
- I think so.

01:23:18.546 --> 01:23:19.630
Good.

01:23:22.174 --> 01:23:24.134
The maid wouldn't take Angus, right?

01:23:24.218 --> 01:23:27.137
I don't think so.
You must take better care of your stuff.

01:23:27.221 --> 01:23:28.389
I know.

01:23:41.276 --> 01:23:43.404
We'll go in your car. Get your keys out.

01:23:43.821 --> 01:23:45.864
You better lock it up, girl.

01:23:48.242 --> 01:23:49.827
Get the keys out.

01:23:50.119 --> 01:23:52.871
We'll have ourselves a little ride.

01:23:53.539 --> 01:23:56.083
Come on, Wilcox, pick up the damn phone.

01:24:08.178 --> 01:24:09.805
- Get in.
- Leave her here.

01:24:09.888 --> 01:24:11.932
Move your hand or I'll cut her head off!

01:24:12.015 --> 01:24:12.933
Get in!

01:24:13.183 --> 01:24:14.351
Hurry up!

01:24:15.394 --> 01:24:16.395
Let's go.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.604
Hurry up.

01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:21.566
Come on, pick it up.

01:24:23.401 --> 01:24:24.569
Come in, quick.

01:24:24.653 --> 01:24:26.154
Get in the car!

01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:41.336
That's Laurie's car!
I think Bobby Earl has them!

01:24:42.462 --> 01:24:43.964
Where is Wilcox?

01:24:59.521 --> 01:25:01.106
Where are we going?

01:25:01.856 --> 01:25:03.191
It's a surprise.

01:25:05.026 --> 01:25:06.611
Stop touching her.

01:25:10.907 --> 01:25:14.911
I'm out of my jurisdiction here.
I need to call for backup.

01:25:37.183 --> 01:25:38.601
Why are you doing this?

01:25:39.018 --> 01:25:40.186
He saved your life.

01:25:40.311 --> 01:25:43.064
Bitch, that don't make up
for what you did to me.

01:25:44.357 --> 01:25:46.859
Let her go. She didn't do anything to you.

01:25:47.026 --> 01:25:48.569
- She's a part of you.
- Let her go.

01:25:48.653 --> 01:25:51.948
She's a tiny version of you.
She'll grow up and be a hero.

01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:53.324
- It's okay.
- Shut up!

01:25:57.119 --> 01:25:58.704
Get down, in case he sees you.

01:26:19.266 --> 01:26:19.934
Damn.

01:26:20.893 --> 01:26:22.645
Pull over! To the left!

01:26:22.728 --> 01:26:23.687
Where?

01:26:23.812 --> 01:26:24.813
I'll kill her!

01:26:31.111 --> 01:26:32.988
They're going against the traffic!

01:26:33.239 --> 01:26:34.573
Bitch, drive!

01:26:46.418 --> 01:26:48.003
Take it! Punch it!

01:26:48.087 --> 01:26:49.671
Punch the gas! Punch it!

01:26:49.755 --> 01:26:50.506
Punch it!

01:26:50.589 --> 01:26:52.925
Bitch, you better drive! Punch it!

01:26:53.759 --> 01:26:55.761
I'll kill her! I'll take her now!

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:25.707
Professor?

01:27:26.083 --> 01:27:27.334
Listen up.

01:27:27.417 --> 01:27:28.251
Daddy?

01:27:30.462 --> 01:27:31.963
Got me a double date.

01:27:32.214 --> 01:27:36.468
<i>Remember Joanie Shriver? That's nothing
compared to what I'll do to your girl.</i>

01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:11.169
There's the car.

01:28:11.336 --> 01:28:13.421
It's the only place he'd be.

01:28:46.829 --> 01:28:48.706
Keep your eyes open, Armstrong.

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.625
We're in his backyard now.

01:28:50.875 --> 01:28:54.337
We need to split up.
I'm going to go around back.

01:28:54.795 --> 01:28:55.963
Here...

01:28:57.757 --> 01:28:59.926
...squeeze one off if you have to.

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:03.554
Don't try to hit nothing.
Just point and squeeze.

01:30:59.919 --> 01:31:01.421
- Where is he?
- Hurry.

01:31:02.505 --> 01:31:03.923
Get it off my mouth.

01:31:04.466 --> 01:31:05.967
He's out there.

01:31:06.176 --> 01:31:07.427
Hurry!

01:31:11.723 --> 01:31:14.142
He's out there somewhere!
Get Katie out of here.

01:31:14.225 --> 01:31:15.226
Quick!

01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:17.687
Everything's going to be all right.

01:31:17.812 --> 01:31:19.689
I don't know if he's coming back.

01:31:54.932 --> 01:31:56.767
Welcome to the party, Professor.

01:31:57.435 --> 01:31:58.561
Stop it!

01:31:58.769 --> 01:32:00.438
Give me Tanny's gun.

01:32:02.773 --> 01:32:05.568
He couldn't stand to see me free,
living the good life...

01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:07.320
...so I killed the fucker.

01:32:07.695 --> 01:32:09.530
Let them go. You have me now.

01:32:11.532 --> 01:32:14.368
It's not you that I want, Professor.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:15.911
Is it Laurie?

01:32:16.537 --> 01:32:20.332
It's not you I've been waiting for
and thinking about the last eight years.

01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:22.710
But she dropped her case against you.

01:32:23.169 --> 01:32:24.628
Not soon enough.

01:32:24.795 --> 01:32:28.799
You had me held for just one night
so you could make a name for yourself.

01:32:29.633 --> 01:32:31.469
Sullivan was right.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:32.928
"The sin is pride."

01:32:33.304 --> 01:32:34.722
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:36.724
I had no idea they'd hurt you.

01:32:36.807 --> 01:32:37.850
Hurt me?

01:32:39.268 --> 01:32:42.104
Do you want to see
what those fuckers did to me?

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:44.481
They cut me.

01:32:46.442 --> 01:32:47.568
They castrated me!

01:32:47.651 --> 01:32:48.819
You feel that?

01:32:51.488 --> 01:32:52.698
You had me...

01:32:53.532 --> 01:32:55.951
Did you think they'd give a shit
about justice?

01:32:57.286 --> 01:32:58.287
Sit down!

01:33:01.957 --> 01:33:03.041
Like that knife?

01:33:04.168 --> 01:33:08.172
That's what put me on the Row and
eight years later that's what made me free.

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:10.048
Please, let Katie go.

01:33:10.257 --> 01:33:12.342
She's just a little girl.

01:33:19.725 --> 01:33:21.852
I'm saving Katie for dessert.

01:33:24.396 --> 01:33:28.066
Now I'm going to do me
these two lovely ladies of yours.

01:33:29.693 --> 01:33:30.485
Easy!

01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.868
Then I'll disappear.

01:33:39.161 --> 01:33:42.789
What I need to know from you is
how do you want to die, first or last?

01:33:45.834 --> 01:33:47.377
And Blair Sullivan?

01:33:48.587 --> 01:33:50.046
Watch your fucking hands!

01:33:54.092 --> 01:33:55.302
What about him?

01:33:55.385 --> 01:33:58.513
Don't fuck with me, Armstrong.
Sullivan is dead.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:02.851
No. The governor gave him
a stay of execution.

01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:05.895
You're a desperate man, Armstrong.

01:34:06.604 --> 01:34:08.690
I brought him the news.

01:34:09.482 --> 01:34:10.608
What fucking news?

01:34:10.734 --> 01:34:13.611
That his parents were still alive and well.

01:34:15.947 --> 01:34:17.198
<i>No, it's my turn now!</i>

01:34:19.742 --> 01:34:21.661
<i>How did my folks look?</i>

01:34:23.121 --> 01:34:24.581
<i>How did they smell?</i>

01:34:25.373 --> 01:34:28.668
<i>They said they forgive you
and will remember you in their prayers.</i>

01:34:28.751 --> 01:34:30.044
You're a fucking liar!

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:32.213
Sullivan will testify against you.

01:34:32.297 --> 01:34:33.756
<i>- You inhuman bastard!
- Liar!</i>

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.592
<i>You cannot cheat me of this!</i>

01:34:39.012 --> 01:34:40.763
<i>We played you like a tune!</i>

01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:44.100
<i>It ain't over yet! You got the trials
of Job ahead of you!</i>

01:34:44.183 --> 01:34:45.852
<i>The trials of Job!</i>

01:35:27.893 --> 01:35:29.562
Get your ass out of the water.

01:36:17.776 --> 01:36:19.611
You all right there, Armstrong?

01:36:20.028 --> 01:36:22.197
I'm in better shape than you are.

01:36:35.085 --> 01:36:37.754
I loved Joanie Shriver
like she was my own.

01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:45.512
Are you going to be okay?

01:36:45.929 --> 01:36:47.597
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:36:49.266 --> 01:36:51.351
Least we'll be able to sleep at night.

01:36:56.982 --> 01:36:58.149
We'll see.
