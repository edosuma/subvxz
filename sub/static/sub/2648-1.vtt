Oh, my God, you are.
You're, like, in cahoots.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.975
Mitchell, I get scared.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.311
When you're around tools,
honey, it's dangerous.

10:44.395 --> 10:47.565
For me, for you,
for our roses.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.567
[Jay]
Works better this way, kid.

10:49.650 --> 10:53.362
I mean, castle goes right up,
nobody gets sliced in half.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.282
Do you know how insulting this is?
I was- [Whirring ]

10:56.407 --> 10:58.784
[Whirring Stops ] I was an intern
at the Songbird Summer Playhouse.

10:58.868 --> 11:01.287
Do you think that the town of
Brigadoon just magically appeared?

11:01.370 --> 11:04.206
Well, in the play, it did.
But the set-

11:04.290 --> 11:08.377
the set was built with these two hands.

Evita's balcony. Okay. Okay.

11:14.008 --> 11:16.177
Oh, where are you going?
I'm going on a walk.

11:16.260 --> 11:19.054
Oh, yeah, I can still
do that by myself. Watch.

11:19.138 --> 11:21.140
Oh, I hope I don't get hurt.

11:21.223 --> 11:24.768
Oh, God. Who put that doorjamb there?
I didn't see it.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.729
I ran right into it.

11:29.023 --> 11:32.193
Oh, no, I tripped.
Walking is so hard.

11:32.276 --> 11:35.446
- That one didn't look like it was on purpose.
- It was!

11:39.158 --> 11:40.993
Just a few more steps.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.494
Oh, sorry. Step. Step.

It's gonna be worth it.

Don't listen to her.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.835

Ow, ow, ow!

[ Claire ]
Time- what?

12:00.429 --> 12:03.349
Tonight, Claire Dunphy,
we are turning back the clock...

12:03.432 --> 12:07.353
to a simpler time when families
piled into their station wagons,

12:07.436 --> 12:11.523
picked up some burgers and went
on a picnic up to Granger Point.

12:11.607 --> 12:13.442
Honey, we don't have to do this.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.527
Listen to her.
No. it's gonna be great.

12:15.611 --> 12:18.572
I talked to, uh- France,
ants, picnic- Nick...

12:18.656 --> 12:20.866
and he's not picking up
the car till tomorrow.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.369
We have one more night
of family fun.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.120
What's gonna be fun about it?
Listen to him.

12:25.204 --> 12:26.872
Only everything.
Only nothing.

12:26.956 --> 12:30.084
Okay, kids, you know what?
Your father is trying to do something nice.

12:30.167 --> 12:34.296
So I would appreciate if you would stop
your whining and just get in the car.

12:35.839 --> 12:39.510
Still does it! Oh, my!
Come on, get in, get in.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.388
[Laughs]

12:42.471 --> 12:45.391
I'm just sayin' the kid's
gotta learn to let things go.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.142
Well, this is a touchy
subject for Mitchell.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.728
He wants to feel like a
regular Joe, like you and I.

12:49.812 --> 12:53.148
Oh, pardonnez-moi! I prefer the
champagne Dijon to the standard yellow.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.152
You know, there are a few
areas that define us as men,

12:57.236 --> 12:59.738
like sports
and construction.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.616
Mitchell just wants to feel
like he's part of the man club.

13:02.700 --> 13:04.576
Isn't that where you guys met?

13:04.660 --> 13:07.788
I know you're making a joke because you're
uncomfortable, so I'll let it slide.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.249
And we met at an orgy.
Ohh!

13:10.332 --> 13:12.293
[ Scoffs ]
Come on.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.169
I just think it's crazy,
that's all.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.921
So what if he can't
swing a hammer?

13:16.005 --> 13:20.301
Look at all he has done: law school,
great career, providing for his family.

13:20.426 --> 13:23.929
That's manly too, isn't it?
I mean, the classical sense. Well, yes.

13:24.013 --> 13:28.475
I mean, I think it also takes a big man to quit
his career as a music teacher and raise a child.

13:28.559 --> 13:31.103
You're a man too, Cam.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.688
Thank you, Jay.

13:32.771 --> 13:36.650
Wait! Garnish.
We're men, not cavemen.

13:36.734 --> 13:39.820
My great-great-grandfather
helped build the Brooklyn Bridge.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.573
I heard that until the day he died,
every time he passed it,

13:42.656 --> 13:45.534
he was filled with such pride.

13:45.617 --> 13:49.538
He'd say, "There's a little bit
of me in that bridge."

13:49.621 --> 13:52.666
I know that I'm not the handiest guy,
but I'm still a man.

13:52.750 --> 13:56.003
And I want to be able to look
out into my yard and say,

13:57.504 --> 13:59.882
“There's a little bit of me
in that princess castle.”

14:06.889 --> 14:11.143
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.686
Oh- Oh, no.

14:12.770 --> 14:15.814
Hey, Mom, Kelly's parents
are on their way.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.817
She invited me to go out to
dinner and a movie with them.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.444
Is that okay?

14:20.527 --> 14:24.365
Oh, but I thought that you and I
were going to the movies tonight.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.575
You know, to see that one
with Shia LaBeouf.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.244
Well, maybe we can go
to the movie another night.

14:29.328 --> 14:31.205

14:31.288 --> 14:34.792
- Wh-What's wrong?
- No, nothing. Just my heart.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.753
Okay, sue me.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.630
I am a Colombian mother.

14:39.713 --> 14:44.134
I'm not gonna let him make a mistake that is
gonna affect him for the rest of my life.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.221
His life.

14:47.304 --> 14:51.392
Manny, I think we should
talk about this Kelly girl.

14:51.475 --> 14:55.604
Isn't she great?
I think she really likes me.

14:57.689 --> 15:01.777
Why wouldn't she like you, baby?
Of course. Go. Have fun.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.238
I'm gonna wear
my burgundy dinner jacket.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.783
Of course you are.

15:07.866 --> 15:11.745
But I say we apologize and just finish
the castle together like he wanted.

15:11.829 --> 15:13.497
Did you hide the nail gun?
Absolutely.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.624
'Cause, I mean, you said that before.
No, I-

15:16.625 --> 15:18.502
Oh, my gosh.
It's finished.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.130
What the hell?
Mitchell did that?

15:21.213 --> 15:24.383
Yes. Yes. Mitchell did it.
Who's the bitch now, bitches?

15:24.466 --> 15:26.593
- Honey, it looks beautiful.
- Well, yeah,

15:26.677 --> 15:28.762
because when you two were inside
enjoying a little tea party,

15:28.846 --> 15:30.973
I was out here-
out here getting stuff done.

15:31.056 --> 15:34.226
I'm sorry. We shouldn't
have underestimated you.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.728
You know he's stuck in there, right?
Oh, yeah.

15:36.812 --> 15:41.775
Uh, hey, kid, Cam and I are gonna crack
a couple cold ones. You wanna join us?

15:41.859 --> 15:44.987
No, no, you know what? I'm just gonna
stay here and get some stuff done.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.239
But you two ladies
enjoy your light beers.

15:47.364 --> 15:50.033
How you know we're having light beers?
We only have light beers.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.744
So, well, listen.
Here is a hammer-

15:52.870 --> 15:54.830

and this is a screwdriver,

get him out of there?
