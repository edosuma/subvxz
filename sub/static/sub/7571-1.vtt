00:25.358 --> 00:27.952
(funk music playing)

01:00.660 --> 01:02.218
Narrator:
After a generation of struggle

01:02.262 --> 01:04.126
changed the face of our nation,

01:04.164 --> 01:06.291
African Americans
entered the '70s

01:06.332 --> 01:08.163
with new found hope.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.896
- I am...
- I am...

01:09.936 --> 01:11.927
- Somebody!
- Somebody!

01:11.971 --> 01:13.370
Vibrant leaders emerged

01:13.406 --> 01:16.239
and black culture reached
its high point,

01:16.276 --> 01:17.709
influencing all facets
of American life.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.543
## Say it louder... ##

01:19.579 --> 01:21.570
Audience:
## I'm black and I'm proud ##

01:21.614 --> 01:23.479
Let me hear you...
## Say it louder... ##

01:23.516 --> 01:26.110
But progress slowed
in the decades that followed.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.712
Black culture began to lose
its distinctive flavor.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.848
(laughs)

01:30.890 --> 01:32.721
And as the millennium
drew to a close,

01:32.759 --> 01:34.522
disaster struck.

01:36.062 --> 01:39.031
These seemingly random events
were in fact orchestrated

01:39.065 --> 01:41.795
by The Man,
a villain obsessed

01:41.835 --> 01:44.827
with turning back the clock
on race relations.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.771
Just when it seemed
the funky spirit

01:46.806 --> 01:48.603
of the '70s
would be lost forever,

01:48.641 --> 01:52.236
a new hero emerged.
His name, Undercover Brother.

01:53.246 --> 01:56.181
## Tear the roof off, we're gonna
tear the roof off the mothersucka ##

01:56.216 --> 01:58.150
## Tear the roof off the sucka ##

01:58.184 --> 02:00.914
## Tear the roof off, we're gonna
tear the roof off the mothersucka ##

02:00.954 --> 02:02.888
## Tear the roof off the sucka ##

02:02.922 --> 02:05.254
## Tear the roof off, we're gonna
tear the roof off the mothersucka ##

02:05.291 --> 02:07.452
## Tear the roof off the sucka ##

02:07.494 --> 02:10.429
## Tear the roof off, we're gonna
tear the roof off the mothersucka ##

02:10.463 --> 02:11.691
## Tear the roof off this sucka ##

02:11.731 --> 02:14.632
## You've got a real type
of thang going down ##

02:14.667 --> 02:16.294
## Getting down ##

02:16.336 --> 02:19.965
## There's a whole lot
of rhythm going round ##

02:20.006 --> 02:23.601
## Whoa! We want the funk ##

02:23.643 --> 02:27.374
## Give up the funk
Ah, we need the funk... ##

02:27.413 --> 02:30.382
Give it to me.
Need it, got to have it.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.475
- ## We need the funk ##
- We need the funk.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.783
- ## Gotta have the funk ##
- Say!

02:34.821 --> 02:37.153
## La-la-la-ya-ya ##

02:37.190 --> 02:41.149
## Do-do-do-do-do... ##

02:42.195 --> 02:44.629
(car honks)

02:44.664 --> 02:47.428
(tires screeching)

02:57.877 --> 03:00.368
## Turn this mother out... ##

03:03.149 --> 03:04.639
It ain't no thang.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.445
(together)
Yeah.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.287
A bird gonna shit
on my windshield?!

03:13.326 --> 03:14.953
Not on my Cadillac!

03:14.994 --> 03:17.986
I'm gonna chop your
feathers off
and put you in Chinatown!

03:18.031 --> 03:20.499
They gonna make
Peking Pigeon out of you!

03:20.533 --> 03:22.296
Damn!

03:22.535 --> 03:24.298
Unbeknownst
to Undercover Brother,

03:24.337 --> 03:27.033
there was a secret organization
dedicated to truth,

03:27.073 --> 03:29.268
justice,
and the Afro-American way.

03:29.309 --> 03:32.710
They had never crossed paths
until now.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.326
(beeping)

03:51.364 --> 03:52.831
Headquarters, come in.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.390
Good work, Sistah Girl.

03:55.435 --> 03:58.996
Data from the mainframe
ready to commence.

03:59.038 --> 04:02.007
- She's transmitting!
Are we up and ready?
- Yes, sir.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.202
And I've hacked into
the bank security system.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.870
Computer:
You've got soul.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.144
- We're in.
- Aha!

04:10.183 --> 04:14.279
The computer!
Another idea stolen from the black man.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.584
Did you all know that
George Washington Carver

04:16.623 --> 04:18.921
made the first computer
out of a peanut?

04:18.958 --> 04:20.322
- Hmm?
- A peanut?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.624
- A peanut!
- Shut up and get back to work!

04:22.662 --> 04:24.755
I've spent six months
setting up this operation

04:24.797 --> 04:26.526
and I want
to see everything...

04:26.566 --> 04:29.694
off-shore accounts,
dummy corporations, money laundering.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.102
If we can cut off his funds,

04:32.138 --> 04:34.436
we may finally be able
to stop The Man.

04:41.481 --> 04:44.450
Waited a long time for this.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.177
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.917
- What the...
- Dissed.

04:50.957 --> 04:54.290
- Ah, solid.
- Hey!

04:54.327 --> 04:56.056
What the hell
are you doing, old man?

04:56.095 --> 04:58.086
(beeping)

05:07.173 --> 05:08.765
- AIl: Whoa!
- Headquarters...

05:08.808 --> 05:11.208
- Is there another
agent on this case?
- Hell, no!

05:11.244 --> 05:12.871
Damn it, who is that guy?

05:12.912 --> 05:15.972
I'll cross-reference the bank's
security camera with our database.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.148
Guard 1:
Come on, Uncle Ben!

05:26.192 --> 05:27.784
(together)
Whoa!

05:31.764 --> 05:33.959
Oh, shit!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.230
It's Macy Gray
with pork-chop sideburns!

05:37.904 --> 05:39.895
(karate yell)

05:41.174 --> 05:42.664
Who's bad?

05:46.479 --> 05:48.208
(screaming)

05:48.247 --> 05:51.114
Ohh! Right up
the pooper!

05:59.225 --> 06:01.955
- (Body & Soul music playing)
- Right on, sweet sistah.

06:04.731 --> 06:06.426
Chief:
Damn it, who is he?!

06:06.466 --> 06:09.458
- (exasperated sigh)
- Sistah Girl, abort mission!

06:12.805 --> 06:15.535
Damn it.
Who was that guy?

06:21.314 --> 06:25.444
## Hey, Undercover ##

06:25.485 --> 06:27.282
- ## Undercover Brother ##
- Solid.

06:29.989 --> 06:33.083
## Here's the plan...
he's got to fight the man ##

06:33.126 --> 06:35.993
## And he's looking fine
when he goes head to head ##

06:36.028 --> 06:39.464
- ## Dig those funky threads ##
- ## Wears his daddy's black
medallion ##

06:39.499 --> 06:41.126
## And it stands for pride ##

06:41.167 --> 06:44.193
## Truth and justice
be your guide ##

06:44.237 --> 06:47.229
- ## He's bad ##
- ## All he does is good ##

06:47.273 --> 06:49.264
## He's the Robin Hood
of the 'hood ##

06:49.308 --> 06:52.436
## Hey-hey, Undercover ##

06:52.478 --> 06:55.777
- Solid.
- ## Undercover Brother ##

06:55.815 --> 06:57.749
## Dressed to kill
in the Coupe Deville ##

06:57.784 --> 06:59.376
## Oh, hey! ##

06:59.419 --> 07:01.853
- ## Undercover ##
- Too funky for myself.

07:01.888 --> 07:05.654
- ## Undercover Brother ##
- ## Undercover Brother. ##

07:05.691 --> 07:07.124
Yeah.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.885
Announcer:
Mr. Feather, The Man wants to see you.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.651
Fabulous.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.961
Newscaster:
And now, the Channel 8 News
with Wendy Marshall

07:43.996 --> 07:45.327
and Chuck Marlboro.

07:45.364 --> 07:49.425
There's growing speculation
that former defense secretary and war
hero,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.994
General Warren Boutwell,
will run for President.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.506
He is considered
the first African-American

07:54.540 --> 07:56.132
with a legitimate chance
of winning.

07:56.175 --> 07:59.144
Wendy?
Yeah, he is a strong
candidate, Chuck.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.043
He's so well-spoken.
I've noticed that.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.243
General Boutwell seems to have
a lot of support all across the nation.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.444
Yes, and not just
in the urban areas.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.183
In fact, the decorated
four-star general and Vietnam vet

08:10.223 --> 08:12.020
is regarded
as one of the country's

08:12.058 --> 08:13.855
most well-respected
public figures.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.190
General:
Thank you very much.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.253
A staunch advocate
for civil rights,

08:17.296 --> 08:20.424
Boutwell has never backed down
from controversial issues.

08:20.466 --> 08:23.731
Indeed, if ever
there was a straighter
arrow
than Warren Boutwell,

08:23.769 --> 08:25.566
we'd be hard-pressed
to find him.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.766
Well, if he does declare
his candidacy,

08:27.807 --> 08:30.071
this certainly will be
an exciting race.

08:30.109 --> 08:33.044
Race? I'm not
touching that one.

08:33.078 --> 08:36.412
First, our children hip-hop
all over the suburbs.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.508
Now Boutwell
might be President?!

08:38.551 --> 08:42.681
They are taking over
every aspect of our culture!

08:42.722 --> 08:45.156
- Don't you agree,
Mr. Feather?
- Word.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.252
- For sheezy, my neezy.
- What did you say?

08:50.263 --> 08:51.958
I said... for sure.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.898
Yes, indeedy.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.958
(coughs)
I have a cold.

08:56.002 --> 08:59.233
I want the White House
to stay white.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.637
Eliminate him!

09:01.674 --> 09:03.767
But, sir,
if we kill him,

09:03.809 --> 09:06.403
we'll only be
making him a hero.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.411
Do you have a better idea?

09:10.449 --> 09:12.917
Our friends
at Multinational Inc.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.579
have been developing
a new drug

09:14.620 --> 09:17.214
with some very
interesting
side effects.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.561
I think we may have found
the perfect guinea pig.

09:33.973 --> 09:37.374
Newscaster:
The so called Afro Bandit
struck Multinational Bank.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.571
However, it appears
no money was stolen.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.706
Authorities questioned
singer Macy Gray,

09:42.748 --> 09:45.979
but she was released
for lack of evidence.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.111
Well, would anybody
like to explain exactly

09:48.154 --> 09:49.917
what the hell happened
at the bank?!

09:49.956 --> 09:52.254
His name
is Undercover Brother.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.019
Apparently, he was erasing
mortgage records

09:58.064 --> 10:00.624
so that low-income families
wouldn't lose their homes.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.758
Sistah Girl:
Great.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.736
A "Soul Train" reject
with a Robin Hood complex.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.295
- Now I've heard everything.
- Hey, hey, hey, now.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.171
At least he got
the job done.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.609
- That's the kind
of man we need around here.
- The keyword being "man"?

10:12.645 --> 10:14.408
Hold on.
I didn't say that, you did.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.142
Man-man.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.309
The General's
press conference is starting!

10:18.351 --> 10:20.012
Newscaster:
We interrupt this broadcast to take you live

10:20.052 --> 10:22.543
to a press conference
by General Warren Boutwell,

10:22.588 --> 10:23.987
in which he is expected
to announce

10:24.023 --> 10:27.151
that he is a candidate
for presidency of the United States.

10:27.193 --> 10:30.026
I wonder if he'll run
as a Democrat or an Independent.

10:30.062 --> 10:33.657
- Never know.
Might be a Republican.
- Oh, please.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.496
What kind
of self-respecting
black man

10:35.534 --> 10:37.001
would run
as a Republican?

10:37.036 --> 10:39.163
Name one thing
the Republican party

10:39.205 --> 10:41.070
has done
for black people. One!

10:41.107 --> 10:43.075
Well, they were
the party of Lincoln.

10:43.109 --> 10:44.838
They stood against
the tyranny of oppression

10:44.877 --> 10:46.538
by leading the call
for the Civil War,

10:46.579 --> 10:49.241
and forced passage
of the Emancipation Proclamation,

10:49.281 --> 10:50.543
which freed the slaves.

10:52.251 --> 10:54.151
All right,
name two things lately.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.154
Damn it, It doesn't matter
what party!

10:56.188 --> 10:58.748
This could be the first step
on the road to putting

10:58.791 --> 11:01.021
an African-American
in the White House.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.995
It's a great day
for black people of all races.

11:06.866 --> 11:09.699
- General: Good morning.
- Think about it!

11:09.735 --> 11:13.068
I've thought long and hard about how
I can best serve my country

11:13.105 --> 11:14.834
now that I'm no longer in uniform.

11:14.874 --> 11:17.001
Well, today...

11:17.043 --> 11:19.170
I am proud to announce

11:19.211 --> 11:21.042
that I will be...

11:21.080 --> 11:25.642
opening a chain
of fried chicken restaurants.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.952
AIl:
General Boutwell!

11:31.691 --> 11:33.022
Yes, sir.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.892
So, you're passing up a chance
to be President

11:35.928 --> 11:37.361
to open a chicken joint?

11:37.396 --> 11:40.422
A man like me doesn't have
any business in politics.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.900
They say you should
always do what you know.

11:42.935 --> 11:45.028
And what I know
is good fried chicken.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.005
- Ohh...
- General: Yes, ma'am.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.133
Don't you think your supporters
in the African-American community

11:50.176 --> 11:52.906
will be particularly disappointed?

11:52.945 --> 11:55.038
Not after they taste
the General's fried chicken.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.309
(gasps)

11:56.348 --> 11:58.714
General:
Surrender, Colonel,
here comes the General.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.151
- Will there be side dishes?
- Sweet potatoes...

12:01.187 --> 12:03.417
- (sighs)
- Black-eyed peas,

12:03.456 --> 12:06.619
- Mashed potatoes, macaroni...
- Mmm.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.184
cornbread,
and the General's special...

12:09.228 --> 12:11.924
hot sauce!

12:11.964 --> 12:14.228
(laughing)
That's all for today.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.359
Thank you very much.
Nice to see you all.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.734
Reporter:
General, what about desert?

12:22.675 --> 12:25.041
You know,
he does have a point
about that Colonel.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.567
I never trusted
the Colonel!

12:26.612 --> 12:29.479
Slaves cooked that chicken!
Ain't no white man know

12:29.515 --> 12:31.710
about no 16 herbs
and spices and giblets!

12:31.751 --> 12:33.912
Smart Brother,
if you so damn smart,

12:33.953 --> 12:36.945
- Why don't you explain
what just happened?
- (stammers)

12:36.989 --> 12:39.150
(mimics stammering)
If I wanted to hear something stupid,

12:39.191 --> 12:43.423
- I'd ask this skinny black ass!
- In your face!

12:43.462 --> 12:45.396
Skinny black... Hey!

12:45.431 --> 12:48.696
We got to find out exactly what happened
to the General, and fast!

12:48.734 --> 12:50.634
I'll get right on it.
Whoa, hold on.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.638
Not that fast. We need
some new blood on this case.

12:53.672 --> 12:57.005
What? Who? You can't just hire
some fool off the streets.

12:57.042 --> 13:00.011
Watch me.
Get me Undercover Brother!

13:00.713 --> 13:02.943
- (toilet flushing)
- Ooh, too funky for myself.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.006
Man on TV:
You were the only man
outside the palace.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.812
- I was outside.
- Jimmy!

13:06.852 --> 13:09.116
- But I wasn't the only one.
- Jim Kelly!

13:09.155 --> 13:12.750
- It is not possible.
- Watch out for the hand!
Watch out for the hand!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.453
(grunting)

13:14.493 --> 13:16.552
Gets you every time!
Spinning back-kick!

13:25.504 --> 13:27.972
(fake yawn)

13:28.007 --> 13:30.805
I think I'll lay down

13:30.843 --> 13:33.175
and get me a little bit
of sleep.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.011
(karate yell)

13:37.850 --> 13:39.841
Don't touch the hair!

13:43.088 --> 13:46.649
Okay, Bruce Leroy,
turn around.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.523
Slowly.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.059
If you gonna shoot me,

13:54.099 --> 13:55.623
shoot me.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.300
Thank you, Jesus.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.103
Hmm.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.474
Dig it.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.147
You that Sistah Girl
from the bank, huh?

14:17.990 --> 14:20.083
I guess you like
what you saw earlier.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.260
Look, baby,
let's stop fooling
around.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.092
Your body's slammin',
let's get to jammin'.

14:25.297 --> 14:26.628
Excuse me?

14:26.665 --> 14:29.964
Oh, nothing relaxes a brother
after a hard day of going
undercover

14:30.002 --> 14:31.833
like a little piece of the cookie.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.997
Goddamn.
My cookie would
break you in half.

14:36.041 --> 14:40.671
Maybe, but that would be
some long division.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.512
Long.

14:44.516 --> 14:46.984
You hit me pretty good,
but I wasn't ready.

14:47.019 --> 14:50.682
Now, any time you think
you want to get feisty
or throw down...

14:51.857 --> 14:54.018
(crash)

14:55.194 --> 14:56.991
So, Sistah Girl,

14:57.029 --> 14:59.497
if you're not here
for Undercover Lover,

14:59.531 --> 15:01.624
you must be here
for Undercover Brother.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.931
What, pray tell,
can I do for you today?

15:05.437 --> 15:07.769
Sistah Girl:
Okay, we're here. Now be cool.

15:07.806 --> 15:10.104
- This place is top secret.
- Undercover Brother: Solid.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.971
Man:
Man, you know you ain't right.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.344
Whoo-oo!

15:15.381 --> 15:17.246
I'm gonna need
my custom shears

15:17.283 --> 15:18.614
for this masterpiece.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.484
Careful. Puncture him
and the hot air's liable to kill you.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.351
- Sistah Girl: Take a seat.
- Don't mind if I do.

15:23.856 --> 15:27.121
- We're gonna hook you right up.
- Holy funkadelic!

15:27.159 --> 15:29.127
This is some kind

15:29.161 --> 15:31.459
of secret organization
you have here.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.855
Look at all this hi-tech
spy equipment.

15:33.899 --> 15:37.926
You got clippers,
you got T.C.B. activator.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.996
I mean, your only competition
must be the K.G.B.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.672
- (laughter)
- Or the F.B.I.

15:48.013 --> 15:49.844
(screaming)

15:52.785 --> 15:55.811
Who the hell are you, woman?
You're the Grim Reaper!

15:55.854 --> 15:57.344
I don't want to go to hell!

15:57.389 --> 15:59.289
I ain't never did
nothing but good!

15:59.325 --> 16:01.657
I swear to God
I ain't done nothing wrong!

16:03.395 --> 16:05.454
(screaming continues)

16:10.469 --> 16:12.266
Oh, come on.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.796
The flashing light and fan
make the drop seem worse than it is.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.141
I knew that.
Mm-hmm.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.952
Computerized voice:
Entering secure area.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.955
Stand here.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.980
Right here?

16:51.844 --> 16:55.405
Computer:
Blackness confirmed. You got soul.

16:55.447 --> 16:57.244
What I'm about to show you

16:57.282 --> 16:59.273
few people have ever seen before.

17:01.253 --> 17:04.654
P. A:
Would Agent Jefferson please pick up
the black courtesy phone?

17:08.460 --> 17:10.758
Agents report
to the ready room.

17:10.796 --> 17:12.787
Agents report
to the ready room.

17:14.465 --> 17:16.763
Welcome
to the Brotherhood.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.633
Solid.

17:20.806 --> 17:22.603
Yes, I know.

17:22.641 --> 17:25.666
I really don't want to talk about this
over the telephone.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.042
Perhaps we could meet
at a secret location?

17:28.079 --> 17:30.708
Okay. No, that sounds great.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.240
All right. Revolution.
Take care.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.219
Man:
"The revolution will not be televised. "

17:35.254 --> 17:38.781
- This is Undercover Brother.
- Hey, how you doing?

17:38.824 --> 17:41.088
Good morning!

17:41.126 --> 17:43.959
Good morning?
Get on the desk!

17:43.996 --> 17:46.294
You brought
a spy around me?!

17:46.331 --> 17:48.697
Spy in the building!

17:48.734 --> 17:50.565
- Don't touch the 'fro.
- Back up off!

17:50.602 --> 17:54.561
- Back up off me!
- Let me tell you something
about the word "good."

17:54.606 --> 17:57.632
Good is an ancient
Anglo-Saxon word.

17:57.676 --> 18:01.009
Go-od, meaning
the absence of color,

18:01.046 --> 18:02.911
i. E... .
"It's all good,"

18:02.948 --> 18:05.576
which it is,
or "Good Will Hunting,"

18:05.617 --> 18:07.915
meaning,
"I'm hunting niggas!"

18:07.953 --> 18:11.081
So if you say "good morning" to me,
you're saying,

18:11.123 --> 18:14.456
"I'm gonna kill your black ass
first thing in the morning!"

18:14.493 --> 18:17.087
- Is that that damn Undercover Brother?!
- You in trouble.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.097
- Where the hell have you been?!
- Hey.

18:19.131 --> 18:21.224
This is a job, not some kind
of damn summer camp!

18:21.266 --> 18:23.097
And I'm tired of you
disrespecting me!

18:23.135 --> 18:26.764
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire your sorry ass!

18:26.805 --> 18:29.774
Because I don't work for you?

18:29.808 --> 18:31.435
Shut up!

18:31.477 --> 18:34.446
Save your smart comments
for the chunky brother in the smock!

18:34.480 --> 18:36.471
Now get in my office!

18:55.334 --> 18:57.461
Congratulations, Mr. Feather.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.300
Thank you, Mister...

18:59.338 --> 19:01.238
The Man.

19:01.273 --> 19:05.403
As you can see,
the General is totally under our control.

19:05.444 --> 19:09.904
The Man:
Yes, our little experiment was a success.

19:09.948 --> 19:14.908
In fact, I've decided to use the General
to launch "Operation Whitewash."

19:14.953 --> 19:18.411
Fabulous. I'll inform Multinational
to step up production.

19:18.457 --> 19:21.756
The only thing standing
in our way is the Brotherhood.

19:21.793 --> 19:25.251
And they won't be a problem,
will they, Feather?

19:25.297 --> 19:27.390
No, sir.

19:27.432 --> 19:28.626
Good.

19:30.302 --> 19:33.294
(mockingly)
Uh, will they, Feather?

19:35.908 --> 19:37.933
(light rock playing)

19:37.976 --> 19:41.173
- New one from Britney...
- (classical music playing)

19:41.213 --> 19:43.408
(scoffs)

19:43.615 --> 19:45.810
(hip-hop music playing)

19:50.822 --> 19:52.483
## Oh-oh ##

19:58.297 --> 20:00.231
## Ooo-mmm ##

20:04.069 --> 20:07.596
## Let's get it crunk upon,
have fun upon ##

20:07.639 --> 20:09.402
## Up in this dancery ##

20:09.441 --> 20:12.274
## We got ya open, now ya floatin' ##

20:12.311 --> 20:14.438
## So you gots to dance for me ##

20:14.479 --> 20:16.777
## Come on, everybody, get on up ##

20:16.815 --> 20:19.283
## 'Cause you know we got
to get it crunk ##

20:19.484 --> 20:22.009
- (music stops)
- What am I doing?!

20:32.664 --> 20:34.723
And that's why we believe
there's got to be

20:34.766 --> 20:38.600
some connection between
the General's announcement and The Man.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.367
Come on, y'all.
Y'all telling me there's really a Man?

20:41.406 --> 20:44.671
What do you think,
Undercover Brother?

20:44.710 --> 20:46.302
If that is your real name.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.575
You think things
just happen by accident?

20:48.614 --> 20:51.674
No! Sometimes people,

20:51.717 --> 20:54.686
mostly white people,
make things happen.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.312
That's where we come in

20:56.355 --> 21:00.689
and our never ending struggle
against The Man,

21:00.726 --> 21:03.820
a.k.a. Whitey,
a.k.a. Mr. Charlie,

21:03.862 --> 21:06.763
a.k.a. Honky McGee.

21:06.798 --> 21:08.789
So, the conspiracies we've believed

21:08.834 --> 21:11.268
for all these years are really true?

21:11.303 --> 21:13.294
The N.B.A. really instituted

21:13.338 --> 21:16.569
the three-point shot
to give white boys a chance?

21:16.608 --> 21:17.870
Smart Brother: Absolutely.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.503
So the entertainment industry
really is out to get Spike Lee.

21:20.545 --> 21:22.979
- Is that right?
- Come on, man!

21:23.015 --> 21:24.949
Even Cher got an Oscar.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.507
Cher-rr!

21:26.551 --> 21:29.418
And O.J. really
didn't do it?

21:32.858 --> 21:35.418
Let's just move on,
shall we?

21:36.528 --> 21:38.996
Holy moly, looks like
the Source Awards in here.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.999
Ow!
It does now.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.058
- Hurting.
- Who's that?

21:43.101 --> 21:45.069
Sistah Girl:
Oh, this is Lance, our intern.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.695
Lance, this is
Undercover Brother.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.205
What's happening?

21:48.240 --> 21:51.607
Whas-ssup?!

21:53.245 --> 21:55.338
Okay, how did
the white boy get a job

21:55.380 --> 21:57.109
here at the Brotherhood?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.947
Shit. What can I tell you?
Affirmative action.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.577
What? Here we go.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.110
Oh, boy.
Open up the window.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.350
It's getting all racial
up in this piece.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.286
Look here,
Undercover Brother,

22:09.328 --> 22:10.920
now that
you're working for us,

22:10.962 --> 22:13.226
you're gonna need to memorize
our rules and regulations.

22:13.265 --> 22:16.132
Trim the hair, and for God's sake,
get rid of the clothes.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.432
Slow your roll, Chief.
You know, I respect

22:18.470 --> 22:20.529
what y'all are doing here
at the Brotherhood,

22:20.572 --> 22:24.235
but I'm a firm believer
in everybody should do their own
thang.

22:24.276 --> 22:27.768
## What a boy wants,
what a boy needs ##

22:27.813 --> 22:29.542
## Whatever... ##

22:29.581 --> 22:31.606
(mutters)

22:31.650 --> 22:33.174
## Free... ##

22:34.853 --> 22:37.583
Okay, he should never
do his own thang.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.693
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

22:46.131 --> 22:49.157
Conspiracy Brother:
I said, "You'd better open
the bank and give me my money."

22:49.201 --> 22:50.532
Yeah?
"It's my money.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.366
I don't care whose bank it is!"
Right.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.998
I know whose money is
in it.
I'm keeping it real.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.508
- That's all I'm saying.
- Hi, Conspiracy Brother.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.271
"Hi"?
What you mean, "Hi"?

22:59.311 --> 23:01.336
Like, "Hi, y'all
want to be white?"

23:01.380 --> 23:04.008
High, like the white man
wants to keep us? Huh?

23:05.183 --> 23:07.447
You don't smell
no weed on me, did you?

23:07.486 --> 23:09.477
Hey, brother, can I get a list

23:09.521 --> 23:11.489
of the words
that trigger these fits?

23:11.523 --> 23:13.115
Man, you really need
to relax.

23:13.158 --> 23:14.785
- Go see a movie.
- A movie?

23:14.826 --> 23:16.521
A movie.
Come on, man!

23:16.561 --> 23:18.791
So I can fall in love
with some cute black man

23:18.830 --> 23:21.458
that teaches white people everything
they know about the shrimp industry

23:21.500 --> 23:23.331
before they kill him
30 minutes into the movie?

23:23.368 --> 23:26.496
"Hey, why don't you walk down
that tunnel, black man?

23:26.538 --> 23:28.699
Hey, black man,
turn on the generator.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.300
This dinosaur is out there.
Hey, black man, look out.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.641
- He's got a gun!"
- (gunshot)

23:33.678 --> 23:35.407
Oh! I'm hit!

23:35.480 --> 23:37.414
But my vest caught it, bitch!

23:37.449 --> 23:39.041
Yes, I'm alive!

23:39.084 --> 23:42.713
I told you to keep your finger
off the trigger of that thing!

23:42.754 --> 23:44.153
I'm cool, everybody.

23:44.189 --> 23:45.781
- Undercover Brother, please.
- Go on back to work.

23:45.824 --> 23:47.553
- Sorry about all that.
- I shit on myself!

23:47.592 --> 23:49.150
I have a couple
of things for you.

23:49.194 --> 23:53.062
Here are your shoes.
I took the liberty of making
a few modifications.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.531
Whoo!

23:54.566 --> 23:57.160
And now, am I correct
in assuming that the
Cadillac

23:57.202 --> 23:59.500
that was double-parked
in the parking lot belongs to you?

23:59.538 --> 24:02.268
Smart Brother,
that is not just a Caddy.

24:02.307 --> 24:04.298
That is a Cadillac
Coupe DeVille.

24:04.342 --> 24:07.140
Conspiracy Brother:
Y'all don't give a shit about me!
I need a sponge bath.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.778
Smart Brother:
That's an orange soda dispenser.

24:10.816 --> 24:13.546
And a crossover amp
and subwoofer for your eight-track.

24:13.585 --> 24:16.577
Ah, man. Smart Brother,
you's a bad mother...

24:16.621 --> 24:19.181
- Shut your mouth!
- (both laugh)

24:19.224 --> 24:20.953
Enjoy, huh?

24:21.159 --> 24:22.353
All right.

24:22.394 --> 24:25.454
Big car, big hair, big necklace.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.227
Someone is clearly
overcompensating.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.827
First of all, you forgot about
my big, black, fuzzy balls.

24:32.237 --> 24:33.135
(gasps)

24:38.143 --> 24:39.770
And secondly,
this is not a necklace,

24:39.811 --> 24:41.870
it's a medallion
given to me by my father

24:41.913 --> 24:44.643
so I never forget who I am
or what I stand for.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.548
I don't need no gold.
Don't need no jewels.

24:46.585 --> 24:49.554
- The medallion
keeps me cool. You dig?
- (beeping)

24:49.955 --> 24:52.150
Chief: Sistah Girl,
Undercover Brother, come in.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.328
What it is, Chief?

24:57.362 --> 24:59.455
We've just discovered
that the General is playing golf

24:59.498 --> 25:01.329
with some of Multinational's
head honchos.

25:01.366 --> 25:04.665
Now, you get yo ass down there
and see what you can find out!

25:04.703 --> 25:06.398
And by the way,
Undercover Screw Up,

25:06.438 --> 25:09.032
don't let me catch your black ass
in the news again.

25:09.774 --> 25:11.139
You hear me?!
I want you to blend in!

25:11.176 --> 25:13.610
Chiefie, baby,
I'm a master of disguises.

25:13.645 --> 25:16.239
I can blend in like a good weave.

25:21.987 --> 25:24.455
- Say, where's that caddy?
- I don't know.

25:24.489 --> 25:26.150
Oh, there he is.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.991
Uh... um...

25:30.028 --> 25:31.723
Jah mon, rasta.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.807
- Nice shot.
- (applauding)

25:50.982 --> 25:53.109
Sistah Girl,
the camera's up.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.645
(beeping)

25:58.723 --> 26:01.089
Would anyone like
some fried chicken?

26:01.126 --> 26:04.425
- Mm-mmm.
- (laughter)

26:10.468 --> 26:12.595
Sistah Girl:
Mr. Feather.

26:12.637 --> 26:14.332
Undercover Brother?

26:14.372 --> 26:16.340
We're definitely
on the right track.

26:16.374 --> 26:19.104
That's the number one
flunkey of The Man.

26:19.144 --> 26:21.669
I'm gonna report to the Chief,
find out what he wants to do.

26:21.713 --> 26:24.181
That cat'll be long gone
by that time.

26:24.215 --> 26:26.046
This thing's
going down now, baby.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.245
This is strictly
an observational mission.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.015
We are not authorized
to take action.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.147
Well, observe this.

26:31.656 --> 26:34.181
Action is what
Undercover Brother's all about.

26:35.193 --> 26:36.626
(sighs)

26:37.529 --> 26:39.326
Hmm. Rasta man.

26:48.840 --> 26:53.675
Oh, the mind control
formula is complete.

26:53.712 --> 26:55.703
(knock on door)

26:55.747 --> 26:57.305
- Who's there?
- Kung!

26:57.349 --> 26:59.340
Kung who?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.213
Kung fool!

27:19.804 --> 27:21.567
Ow, my wrist.

27:24.075 --> 27:26.066
Help! Thief!
There's a thief here!

27:26.111 --> 27:28.807
- What the hell is your problem?
- Give me back my things!

27:28.847 --> 27:31.645
Thief!
Hey, give me that back!

27:31.683 --> 27:32.672
Hey!

27:35.487 --> 27:37.455
Hold it!

27:37.489 --> 27:39.980
Holy Motown.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.100
- Come on.
- You don't want
to mess with me, man!

27:50.135 --> 27:51.397
(mocking)

27:59.010 --> 28:01.035
I had 'em, baby.
Yeah, I saw.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.774
Come on, let's go!

28:03.948 --> 28:05.415
(thump, groans)

28:05.450 --> 28:06.849
Come on!

28:09.120 --> 28:11.418
Stop where you are!
This is security!

28:11.456 --> 28:13.924
- Do not move!
- Quick! This way!

28:13.958 --> 28:15.550
Aw, hell, they moved.

28:19.898 --> 28:22.298
Do it.
Code 37.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.874
Oh-oh!

28:34.079 --> 28:36.604
- Is he crazy?
- Okay, slow down!

28:39.217 --> 28:41.651
- Slow, slow, slow.
- (honking)

28:41.686 --> 28:43.984
Hey, slow down
over there, people!

28:46.491 --> 28:47.981
Hold the wheel, baby.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.963
- No! No!
- Oh, no!

28:52.997 --> 28:55.329
Oh, jeez!
Too fast!

28:55.366 --> 28:57.163
Losing control!

29:01.906 --> 29:04.272
(both screaming)

29:12.617 --> 29:13.914
(screaming continuing)

29:13.952 --> 29:15.180
(screaming stops)

29:24.963 --> 29:27.830
- There's got to be
another way out of here.
- Hold it!

29:27.866 --> 29:29.697
(guns cock)

29:45.483 --> 29:47.212
Thanks for the lift.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.517
Smart Brother:
A spectral analysis
has ironically
confirmed

29:52.557 --> 29:54.957
traces of poultry
on Mr. Feather.

29:54.993 --> 29:56.893
This proves that
The Man must be behind

29:56.928 --> 29:59.021
Multinational Inc. 's deal
with the General.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.725
I don't get it.
What does The Man
got to do with fried chicken?

30:01.766 --> 30:04.462
Is that his big plan,
to get black people to eat junk food?

30:04.502 --> 30:06.834
Open your eyes,
Undercover Brother!

30:06.871 --> 30:10.398
This has to do with
discrediting the General.

30:10.441 --> 30:12.375
That is
the white man's
tactic.

30:12.410 --> 30:14.378
He don't want
no black President.

30:14.412 --> 30:15.845
You've seen it
all through history.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.814
They never give
black men credit.

30:17.849 --> 30:20.841
Jesus Christ...
black man.

30:20.885 --> 30:24.685
Babe Ruth...
black man.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.355
Madonna!

30:28.526 --> 30:30.323
Sleeps with black men.

30:30.361 --> 30:32.556
Think about it.

30:32.597 --> 30:34.724
So the General
sold out to The Man.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.563
I don't think
it's that simple.

30:36.601 --> 30:39.627
When you're dealing
with The Man, it never is.

30:40.872 --> 30:45.002
Our only choice here
is to infiltrate Multinational Inc.

30:45.043 --> 30:47.637
Then we can find out
what happened to the General.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.341
It'll be a very
dangerous assignment.

30:51.549 --> 30:53.517
It'll be your most
vigorous training yet.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.212
You're gonna have to think and act

30:55.253 --> 30:57.687
just like a tight-butt white man
with a 401K plan

30:57.722 --> 30:59.349
and a country club membership.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.324
So pay attention.

31:06.197 --> 31:07.664
Here...

31:07.699 --> 31:09.997
have a bite of this...

31:10.034 --> 31:11.228
sandwich.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.134
How did you
know
I was hungry?

31:13.171 --> 31:15.002
I ain't eat nothing
this morning.

31:19.010 --> 31:22.207
- You trying to kill me?
- If you're going to pass
in white America,

31:22.247 --> 31:25.307
you are going to have
to learn to like mayonnaise!

31:25.350 --> 31:26.544
No!
Listen...

31:26.584 --> 31:29.644
if you're ever forced
to eat this mayonnaise,

31:29.687 --> 31:32.349
simply press the button
on this side of the watch.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.018
It delivers a rather liberal
spritzing of hot sauce.

31:35.059 --> 31:38.358
One blast should be enough
to make Caucasian food edible.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.954
Well, it works on grits.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.631
Now, since time
is of the essence,

31:44.669 --> 31:46.660
I developed a device
that allows you

31:46.704 --> 31:48.729
to absorb the whole
of white culture

31:48.773 --> 31:51.708
in mere seconds
using subliminal imagery.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.142
I call it...

31:53.177 --> 31:56.078
Caucasiavision.

31:56.114 --> 31:58.912
Hey, I feel like George Clinton.

32:00.018 --> 32:01.576
## We want the funk. ##

32:01.619 --> 32:04.144
- Turn it on.
- (machine whines)

32:06.557 --> 32:08.422
## Here we go one more time ##

32:08.459 --> 32:10.723
## Everybody's feeling fine ##

32:10.762 --> 32:13.253
- ## Here we go now ##
- ## Yes, yes, here we go ##

32:13.298 --> 32:15.732
- ## 'N Sync has got to flow... ##
- No!

32:15.767 --> 32:18.736
## Get to the beat,
we've got everything you need... ##

32:18.770 --> 32:20.169
Make it stop!
Make it stop!

32:20.204 --> 32:21.728
## Yes, here we go... ##

32:21.773 --> 32:23.764
(screams)

32:23.808 --> 32:25.503
Don't you
give up on me!

32:26.678 --> 32:28.805
I see white people.
It's too much!

32:28.846 --> 32:30.177
Too much!
Caucasian overload!

32:31.149 --> 32:32.810
Caucasian overload.
Breathe.

32:32.850 --> 32:34.477
Caucasian overload!
Breathe.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.011
Breathe. Breathe.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.854
That's too much white
for one brother to take.

32:42.894 --> 32:44.225
You did good.

32:44.262 --> 32:46.423
We need to make sure
the process worked,

32:46.464 --> 32:50.696
so I called in an expert
on white culture.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.509
"In season three
of 'Friends, '

33:07.585 --> 33:12.249
what object of Julia's
did Ross see on his bedside table

33:12.290 --> 33:14.281
the night
he kissed Rachel?"

33:21.833 --> 33:23.494
Her saline solution.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.101
He's ready.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.507
Hi, there.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.843
How are you doing?

33:45.390 --> 33:47.688
What do you say there?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.291
Howdy.
May I help you?

33:50.328 --> 33:51.818
I sincerely hope so.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.831
Today's my first day
at Multinational.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.163
Oh, my.
Jackson.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.667
Anton Jackson.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.897
And no, not one
of the Jackson Five.

33:59.937 --> 34:01.666
(forced chuckle)

34:03.074 --> 34:05.599
Here we go.
You're in suite 54.
Tobacco division.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.936
We need some fresh,

34:07.979 --> 34:11.107
hip strategies to expand
our market share.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.639
As it turns out,
I have just the product.

34:15.652 --> 34:17.449
Here's one
of your cigarettes.

34:17.487 --> 34:18.784
Take a good look at
it.

34:18.822 --> 34:21.621
It's pale, small,
a little on the limp side.

34:21.659 --> 34:22.989
It's basically inadequate.

34:23.027 --> 34:25.188
It can't possibly give much
pleasure to the user.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.789
- It sure can't.
- I mean, ask yourselves,

34:27.831 --> 34:30.027
how many black people
are gonna want to smoke this?

34:30.068 --> 34:32.297
- Not the one I know.
- You have to effectively position

34:32.335 --> 34:34.304
your product
within the black consumer.

34:34.338 --> 34:37.136
May I present to you
The Fatty?

34:38.141 --> 34:41.202
Hmm? It's got that
hand-rolled look and feel

34:41.245 --> 34:43.645
that's so popular
with today's black youth.

34:43.681 --> 34:47.639
It's big. It's full
of long-lasting pleasure

34:47.685 --> 34:50.051
- To be enjoyed again...
- (woman panting)

34:50.088 --> 34:52.181
(moans)

34:54.692 --> 34:56.387
I could use a smoke.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.827
Yeah? Good.

35:02.133 --> 35:05.125
It's time to say goodbye
to Anton Jackson...

35:09.307 --> 35:12.105
and say what it is
to Undercover Brother.

35:14.645 --> 35:16.237
Whee-hee!

35:16.280 --> 35:18.145
Now, that's
a long way down.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.694
(raps on glass)

35:48.179 --> 35:49.840
Hey!

36:17.141 --> 36:19.439
Come in, Brotherhood.
Are you digging me?

36:19.477 --> 36:21.069
Undercover Brother.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.410
I'll transmit some
computer files about the General.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.472
- See what you can do with it.
- Smart Brother: Right on.

36:32.423 --> 36:35.483
The chief wants you to stay undercover
until we decode this information.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.494
- I can dig it.
- But be careful.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.655
If they're onto you,
they might set up a trap.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.289
I know this
is the wrong time,

36:41.332 --> 36:43.129
but I wanted to let
you know,

36:43.167 --> 36:45.067
I'm thinking about you, girl.

36:45.102 --> 36:47.468
I'm bouncin'.
Shakin' a spot.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.735
- Gone.
- Bye.

36:49.774 --> 36:51.901
(mimicking)
Bye.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.534
(alarm blaring)

36:53.578 --> 36:55.546
Mr. Elias,
there's been a breach!

36:55.580 --> 36:57.912
(grunts)
That afro!

36:57.949 --> 37:00.042
I'd recognize it
anywhere.

37:00.084 --> 37:02.416
The Brotherhood
is making their move.

37:02.453 --> 37:04.387
Just as I expected.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.551
It's time to release
our secret weapon.

37:08.593 --> 37:11.221
I call it...

37:11.262 --> 37:14.425
Black Man's kryptonite.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.591
## I want to be bad ##

37:16.634 --> 37:19.228
## Make that look so good ##

37:19.270 --> 37:21.966
## I've got things on my mind ##

37:22.006 --> 37:24.941
## I never thought I would ##

37:24.976 --> 37:27.444
## I want to be bad ##

37:27.478 --> 37:29.969
## You make me feel so good ##

37:30.014 --> 37:33.142
- ## I'm losing all my cool... ##
- How's it going there?

37:33.184 --> 37:34.879
What the hell?

37:35.519 --> 37:37.487
Oh, dear.

37:37.521 --> 37:40.456
Oh, what am I gonna do?

37:40.491 --> 37:42.459
My gosh.

37:43.661 --> 37:46.824
Look at this mess.
Oh, dear.

37:48.499 --> 37:50.797
I'm so sorry.
Let me help you.

37:50.835 --> 37:52.427
Jeez, that's sweet of you.

37:52.470 --> 37:54.495
If I mess up my boss' report,

37:54.538 --> 37:57.006
he's gonna have a conniption
with a capital K.

37:57.041 --> 38:00.909
- Oh.
- Penelope Snow.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.743
Anton Jackson.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.749
I'm so sorry. Here.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.809
Thanks, Anton.
You're so sweet.

38:08.853 --> 38:12.414
And cute, too.
In a Theo Huxtable kind of way.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.589
Are you new here?

38:15.626 --> 38:18.026
Yeah, it's my first day.
Mine too.

38:18.062 --> 38:19.927
- Really?
- Yeah, I just moved here

38:19.964 --> 38:21.932
bringing nothing by my hopes
and my dreams.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.958
But sometimes the big city
can be so...

38:26.137 --> 38:27.934
...big.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.533
A girl needs friends, Anton.

38:31.575 --> 38:33.805
Would you like to be my friend?

38:35.546 --> 38:37.810
(music begins playing)

38:40.685 --> 38:43.210
Penelope:
## We all know ##

38:43.254 --> 38:48.351
## That people are the same
wherever you go ##

38:48.459 --> 38:51.553
## There is good and bad ##

38:51.595 --> 38:53.529
## In everyone... ##

38:53.564 --> 38:54.690
Hey.

38:54.732 --> 38:57.929
## When we learn
to live ##

38:57.968 --> 39:00.562
## We learn to
give
each other ##

39:00.604 --> 39:03.767
## What we need
to survive ##

39:03.808 --> 39:06.641
## Together alive ##

39:06.677 --> 39:11.774
Both:
## Ebony and ivory ##

39:11.816 --> 39:17.277
## Live together
in perfect harmony ##

39:17.321 --> 39:22.759
## Side by side
on my piano keyboard ##

39:22.793 --> 39:24.192
## Oh, Lord ##

39:24.228 --> 39:28.722
## Why don't we? ##

39:28.766 --> 39:30.734
- Yeah!
- (instrumental breakdown)

39:30.768 --> 39:32.759
(crowd cheering)

39:36.540 --> 39:37.666
Yeah!

39:39.577 --> 39:41.568
(laughter)

39:41.612 --> 39:44.308
## Ivory ##

39:44.348 --> 39:47.442
## Ebony ##
## Oh-oh ##

39:47.485 --> 39:50.045
## Ivory ##

39:50.087 --> 39:52.385
## Ebony. ##

39:52.423 --> 39:54.448
Penelope:
I didn't know you had such
a beautiful voice.

39:55.659 --> 40:00.119
You know, you and I
have tons in common.

40:00.164 --> 40:02.962
I know what it feels like
to be discriminated against.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.458
I mean, just because a girl
has a healthy sexual appetite,

40:06.504 --> 40:08.404
doesn't mean
she can't do her job.

40:08.439 --> 40:11.067
- Uh-huh.
- They look at you

40:11.108 --> 40:13.975
and all they see
is a threatening black man.

40:14.011 --> 40:15.478
(whimpers)

40:15.513 --> 40:17.879
And they look at me,
and all they see

40:17.915 --> 40:20.475
are my full breasts
and my narrow waist

40:20.518 --> 40:22.247
that tapers
to my pert backside.

40:22.286 --> 40:24.652
It's just not fair.
Huh-uh.

40:24.688 --> 40:27.020
- Here you go, folks.
- Yum.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.592
- And here's the extra
mayonnaise you ordered.
- Yum, yum.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.463
- Enjoy.
- This is the best stuff.

40:37.868 --> 40:39.733
Have you eaten
here before, Anton?

40:39.770 --> 40:41.738
No, I haven't.
It's my first time.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.603
Oh, take a bite
of my sandwich.

40:43.641 --> 40:45.404
(gulps)

40:45.443 --> 40:47.468
Come on, Anton.

40:48.579 --> 40:50.638
Just one little bite.

41:00.724 --> 41:02.021
Scrumptious.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.559
Penelope:
Oh, Anton,

41:07.598 --> 41:10.726
I can't wait to see you
in these corduroys.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.793
You're gonna
make me blush.

41:12.837 --> 41:15.362
And you might not see it!

41:15.406 --> 41:17.840
May I help you, sir?

41:19.176 --> 41:20.165
(thud)

41:20.211 --> 41:21.644
Hello, fellow person of color.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.408
How's it going today?

41:25.282 --> 41:27.910
- What's going down?
- What are you doing
with that girl?

41:27.952 --> 41:29.476
- What girl?
- That girl!

41:29.520 --> 41:31.317
- Oh, the white woman.
- Mm-hmm.

41:31.355 --> 41:32.982
I'm undercover.

41:33.023 --> 41:35.924
When you go undercover, you have
to do things you wouldn't normally do.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.791
No matter how difficult,
how dangerous,

41:37.828 --> 41:39.693
how good it might have felt.

41:39.730 --> 41:42.722
Like having sex with white girls?

41:42.766 --> 41:44.996
Damn it, woman,
would you just back off?!

41:45.035 --> 41:48.994
Computerized voice:
Attention angry black man in khakis.

41:49.039 --> 41:52.065
Golly, I must have tripped
or something.

41:52.109 --> 41:54.509
Hi, Ton-ja.

41:54.545 --> 41:56.843
Listen...

41:56.881 --> 42:00.180
I was wondering,
do you have any dickies?

42:00.217 --> 42:01.775
'Cause I couldn't
find them.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.480
Really?
Mm-hmm.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.456
Perhaps we're all sold out.

42:06.490 --> 42:08.458
Aw, that's too bad.

42:08.492 --> 42:10.050
Come on, Anton.

42:10.094 --> 42:12.756
I saw a mock turtleneck
at Eddie Bauer

42:12.796 --> 42:15.390
that's perfect for you.

42:15.432 --> 42:18.094
Thanks for all your help.
Bye-bye, Ton-ja.

42:18.302 --> 42:19.826
Bye-bye.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.108
(screaming)
And action!

42:31.882 --> 42:33.349
I want you...

42:34.351 --> 42:37.184
to buy my new
fried chicken, that is.

42:38.522 --> 42:40.820
Sure enough.

42:40.858 --> 42:42.655
I used to work
for the Pentagon,

42:42.693 --> 42:44.820
now I help you to get
your chicken on.

42:44.862 --> 42:46.659
And for a limited time only,

42:46.697 --> 42:48.665
order an eight-piece
Nappy Meal,

42:48.699 --> 42:52.499
and get a 32-ounce
malt liquor absolutely free.

42:52.536 --> 42:55.164
- ## You be buyin' ##
- ## Yeah, yeah ##

42:55.205 --> 42:57.571
- ## We be frying ##
- Woo-woo!

42:57.608 --> 42:59.235
## General's chicken ##

42:59.276 --> 43:01.301
## The best chicken
in the 'hood ##

43:01.345 --> 43:02.972
## Yeah, yeah ##

43:03.013 --> 43:05.777
- ## Legs, breasts and thighs ##
- Mm-hmm.

43:05.816 --> 43:08.376
## Sweet potato pies ##

43:08.419 --> 43:11.582
- ## General's Fried Chicken ##
- General: Lord have mercy.

43:11.622 --> 43:13.453
## General's Fried Chicken ##

43:13.490 --> 43:16.118
## It's butt kickin' ##

43:16.160 --> 43:17.627
## General's Fried ##

43:17.661 --> 43:19.288
## You know it tastes so good ##

43:19.330 --> 43:23.130
Announcer:
Introducing the Nappy Meal from G.F.C.

43:23.167 --> 43:25.658
This chicken is the bomb.

43:27.671 --> 43:31.004
At the General's,
we do chicken right-on!

43:32.176 --> 43:34.440
Will you look at that?

43:34.478 --> 43:37.504
The General's lost
his damn mind.

43:37.548 --> 43:39.641
He's making a fool
out of himself over this crap.

43:39.683 --> 43:41.810
Lance:
## General's Fried Chicken ##

43:41.852 --> 43:43.786
## It's butt kickin' ##

43:43.821 --> 43:45.618
## Hey, hey ##

43:47.524 --> 43:49.185
What?
It's catchy.

43:49.226 --> 43:50.989
Reminds me
of the Fresh Prince.

43:51.028 --> 43:52.620
I like him.
He raps happy.

43:53.697 --> 43:56.165
Chief:
Excuse me, sir.
This is a restricted... good
God!

43:56.200 --> 43:58.760
- Heya, Chiefster. Lance.
- Nice pants.

43:58.802 --> 44:01.270
- Undercover Brother?
- Undercover Brother?

44:01.905 --> 44:05.136
- What happened to you?
- He had sex with a white girl,
that's what!

44:05.175 --> 44:07.439
Was it everything
I dreamed of?
It was good.

44:07.911 --> 44:09.139
She had pink nipples?
Big ones.

44:09.179 --> 44:11.374
- Yeah, big ones.
- Yeah.

44:11.415 --> 44:13.906
Chief: Her carpet
matched her drapes?
Excuse me?

44:16.520 --> 44:20.354
- No, man.
You can't be doing that.
- What were you doing?

44:20.391 --> 44:23.827
- White girl or no white girl,
where the hell have you been?
- Not there,

44:23.861 --> 44:26.625
'cause that's where people who swear go.
Thank you very much.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.962
You sound like
a 14-year-old white chick.

44:28.999 --> 44:31.934
I don't think so, Sister Girl.

44:31.969 --> 44:34.995
It's Sistah Girl, dude.

44:35.039 --> 44:37.200
Maybe on Planet Ebonics.
But where I come from,

44:37.241 --> 44:39.607
we like to pronounce
our E's and our R's,

44:39.643 --> 44:41.406
thank you very much.

44:41.445 --> 44:43.970
E's and R's?

44:44.014 --> 44:46.175
Ebonics, huh?
I be thinking

44:46.216 --> 44:49.549
that somebody in this room
is selling out.

44:49.586 --> 44:51.451
I say we kill him.
Shut the door, nigga.

44:51.488 --> 44:53.615
Shh, it's gonna be
all right, baby. Don't look!

44:53.657 --> 44:55.921
I'm sorry, dawg,
but you need...
Hey, buddy,

44:55.959 --> 44:59.486
if I hadn't read that article in Vanity Fair
on anger management,

44:59.530 --> 45:02.499
I'd put away this guava-
mango-broccoli smoothie

45:02.533 --> 45:05.058
- And put my foot
in your patootie.
- Patootie?

45:05.102 --> 45:07.002
Now maybe you guys
don't like the new me,

45:07.037 --> 45:09.005
but I don't give a gosh darn.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.301
For all I care,

45:10.340 --> 45:12.274
you can all get
the beejeebies out of here.

45:12.309 --> 45:14.607
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must be going.

45:14.645 --> 45:16.135
"Frasier" is on.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.341
"Frasier"?

45:22.319 --> 45:24.048
Beejeebies?

45:24.088 --> 45:26.079
He said he would stick his foot

45:26.123 --> 45:28.853
up my so-called "patootie."
Damn it.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.519
I knew this could happen.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.826
You can only keep
an agent undercover for so long

45:33.864 --> 45:35.297
before he loses his identity.

45:35.332 --> 45:39.325
Hell, no man can resist
low interest loans

45:39.369 --> 45:41.496
and non-fat lattes forever.

45:41.538 --> 45:43.130
And white women.

45:43.173 --> 45:44.902
So wait,
let me get this straight.

45:44.942 --> 45:46.466
Whenever a black guy does well,

45:46.510 --> 45:49.138
starts wearing Dockers,
buys a few Celine Dion records,

45:49.179 --> 45:50.737
and sleeps with a white chick,

45:50.781 --> 45:52.146
you automatically
say he's sold out?

45:52.182 --> 45:53.444
That's enough!

45:53.517 --> 45:56.850
(scoffs)
Always trying to shut
the white man down.

45:56.887 --> 45:59.048
That's right!
That's right!

45:59.089 --> 46:02.081
- Oh, that ain't right.
- Sistah Girl: What's the word?

46:02.126 --> 46:04.924
I was able to decode
the data from Multinational Inc.

46:04.962 --> 46:06.554
The General is under
the influence

46:06.597 --> 46:09.225
of a psycho-
hallucinogenic drug.

46:09.266 --> 46:11.564
It's a mind control drug, sir.
Very powerful.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.399
Very easy to use.

46:14.805 --> 46:16.272
Good Lord.

46:16.306 --> 46:20.367
With something like that,
The Man could control every
black person in America.

46:20.410 --> 46:23.937
Theoretically, yes, but it would take years
to administer the doses individually.

46:23.981 --> 46:25.881
To be efficient,
you'd need to develop

46:25.916 --> 46:27.884
a huge distribution system.

46:27.918 --> 46:29.909
(crunching)

46:31.522 --> 46:33.183
(together)
The chicken!

46:35.726 --> 46:38.422
I hate to say it,

46:38.462 --> 46:41.625
if Undercover Brother
don't get his shit together,

46:41.665 --> 46:44.156
this may be one battle
we might lose to The Man.

46:46.236 --> 46:50.229
Smart Brother,
am I gonna die?

46:50.440 --> 46:52.465
## Dumps like a truck...
truck, truck ##

46:52.509 --> 46:54.477
## All night long ##

46:54.511 --> 46:59.278
## Let me see that thong ##

46:59.316 --> 47:02.251
Honey?
Yeah?

47:02.286 --> 47:05.221
Is this Michael Bolton's
version of that thong song?

47:05.255 --> 47:07.120
No, but I want that one.

47:07.157 --> 47:10.786
I hear he got all the funk
that Sisqo missed.

47:10.828 --> 47:12.295
Do you like this?

47:12.329 --> 47:14.456
You know, usually I'm not
into the heavy stuff,

47:14.498 --> 47:16.625
but this is kinda catchy.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.328
It is, isn't it?
Yeah.

47:19.770 --> 47:23.399
- I made us some sandwiches.
- Extra mayo for me, please.

47:31.515 --> 47:33.312
Freeze, sucka!

47:33.350 --> 47:35.318
Put down
the mayonnaise...

47:35.352 --> 47:36.683
slowly.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.449
It's that colored girl,
Ton-ja.

47:44.761 --> 47:47.787
Now, Buffy the Black Man Slayer,
step away from the brotha.

47:47.831 --> 47:49.731
- Bye, brother.
- Come on.

47:49.766 --> 47:51.734
- Bye.
- Move it.

47:51.768 --> 47:54.259
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

47:54.304 --> 47:57.603
Why? So you can tell me
what a sellout I am again?

47:57.641 --> 47:59.632
Oh, I don't judge people
by how they dress,

47:59.676 --> 48:01.701
or what music
they listen to.

48:01.745 --> 48:04.771
But I remember a brother
who wasn't afraid to be himself,

48:04.815 --> 48:07.648
who taught me to follow
my own funky path,

48:07.684 --> 48:09.982
stand up for
what I think is right.

48:11.154 --> 48:12.951
Remember this?

48:15.826 --> 48:17.794
Penelope:
lgnore her, Anton.

48:17.828 --> 48:21.195
I'm all the single white female
you'll ever need.

48:21.231 --> 48:24.632
I want to. Really, I do.

48:24.668 --> 48:27.501
All day, but I can't.

48:30.340 --> 48:32.535
I must be true to myself.

48:32.576 --> 48:35.044
Look at that white girl.
Are you crazy?

48:35.078 --> 48:37.308
The darker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

48:37.347 --> 48:39.747
Corduroys
are so comfortable.

48:39.783 --> 48:42.343
Got to get funky.

48:43.453 --> 48:45.512
## Hey, macarena,
all right! ##

48:57.200 --> 48:59.691
I can't throw this away.

48:59.736 --> 49:01.670
'Cause like this medallion...

49:02.706 --> 49:04.640
this brother's here to stay.

49:05.809 --> 49:08.835
What's up, Sistah Girl?
Look at you!

49:08.879 --> 49:11.245
What took you so long?

49:11.281 --> 49:14.307
- You don't think
the heels are too much?
- No, it's funktabulous.

49:14.351 --> 49:16.114
- 'Cause I was gonna go...
- Hold it right there...

49:16.153 --> 49:18.644
Undercover Brother.
Drop it!

49:19.823 --> 49:22.553
- This woman just can't get...
- I meant the gun.

49:35.172 --> 49:37.299
That's White She-Devil,

49:37.341 --> 49:39.536
The Man's secret weapon.

49:39.576 --> 49:41.237
Sorry.

49:44.314 --> 49:46.612
It's time to...

49:46.650 --> 49:48.584
platform out of here.

49:56.293 --> 49:57.988
Damn duck shoes.

49:58.028 --> 50:00.155
Looks like
we're in hot water.

50:00.197 --> 50:03.257
Or hot sauce.

50:03.467 --> 50:05.458
(screaming)

50:08.505 --> 50:09.733
Come on!
Come on.

50:09.773 --> 50:11.104
Come on.
It's not fair.

50:11.141 --> 50:12.938
'N Sync!

50:12.976 --> 50:14.443
Backstreet Boys!

50:14.478 --> 50:16.844
And Boyz II Men!
We really sing!

50:16.880 --> 50:19.144
Elton John!
Billie Jean King!

50:19.182 --> 50:21.207
## Look at her ##

50:21.251 --> 50:23.378
## She's a bad mama jama ##

50:25.222 --> 50:27.850
## Just as fine as she can be ##

50:29.793 --> 50:31.693
## She's a bad mama jama... ##

50:32.696 --> 50:34.630
Come on, White She-Devil.
I been waiting.

50:34.664 --> 50:36.063
Come on, baby.
Come on!

50:38.001 --> 50:42.131
## Her body measurements are perfect
in every dimension ##

50:42.172 --> 50:45.903
## She's got a figure
that's gonna bring attention ##

50:45.942 --> 50:48.342
## She's poetry in motion ##

50:48.378 --> 50:50.243
## A beautiful sight to see ##

50:50.280 --> 50:53.875
## I get so excited
viewing her anatomy ##

50:54.217 --> 50:57.744
## She's built...
oh, she's dynamic... ##

50:57.788 --> 51:00.256
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

51:00.290 --> 51:02.224
(cat snarls)

51:03.727 --> 51:05.422
Bitch!

51:05.462 --> 51:07.487
You know how much
this shit cost?

51:07.531 --> 51:09.328
How much did this shit cost,
you disco queen?!

51:10.500 --> 51:11.831
- All of this!
- How dare you!

51:15.806 --> 51:18.331
Hey!

51:18.375 --> 51:20.570
Undercover Brother:
Touch it. Now looky here.

51:25.849 --> 51:27.714
(whistling)

51:27.751 --> 51:29.378
Whew! Whew, baby!

51:29.419 --> 51:31.614
Toast to the booty!
Booty toast.

51:33.390 --> 51:34.914
Oh, yeah!

51:36.526 --> 51:38.289
Wait! Look at that.

51:38.328 --> 51:40.762
##... She's mighty mighty,
just letting it all hang out ##

51:40.797 --> 51:44.255
## She's a brickhouse ##

51:45.669 --> 51:47.603
## The lady's stacked,
and that's a fact ##

51:47.637 --> 51:49.832
- (shudders)
- ## Ain't holding nothing back ##

51:49.873 --> 51:53.240
## Ow, she's a brickhouse... ##

51:53.276 --> 51:55.005
The water's cold.
Water cold!

51:55.045 --> 51:57.013
## Now we're together,
everybody knows ##

51:57.581 --> 51:58.479
## This is how the story goes... ##

51:58.515 --> 52:01.848
Nothin' like safe sex,
you know what I'm saying?

52:03.186 --> 52:05.882
Look at that.
Look at that there.

52:05.922 --> 52:06.889
Bitch!

52:15.632 --> 52:17.224
You enjoy yourself?

52:38.321 --> 52:40.653
Would you stop
fooling around?

52:42.359 --> 52:44.827
Got to get my cool back!

52:47.631 --> 52:49.030
(tires screech)

52:59.142 --> 53:01.633
Can you play something funky
for a brother to drive to?

53:02.145 --> 53:03.772
(funk music playing)

53:08.618 --> 53:10.085
Drive!
Drive this thing!

53:10.120 --> 53:12.020
Baby, it was made
in the '70s.

53:12.055 --> 53:13.283
This ain't no Ferrari.

53:19.863 --> 53:22.229
## Jungle boogie ##

53:22.265 --> 53:24.392
## Jungle boogie ##

53:24.434 --> 53:26.595
## Jungle boogie ##

53:26.636 --> 53:27.830
## Jungle boogie... ##

53:27.871 --> 53:30.567
Damn.
Look out, baby.

53:46.623 --> 53:48.648
## Jungle boogie ##
## Get up with the get down ##

53:48.692 --> 53:50.592
## Jungle boogie ##

53:51.595 --> 53:53.756
- ## Jungle boogie ##
- ## Oh yeah ##

53:53.797 --> 53:56.061
## Jungle boogie... ##

53:56.099 --> 53:57.430
(motorcycle revs)

53:57.701 --> 53:59.692
(music continuing)

54:02.939 --> 54:04.497
(music stops)

54:05.108 --> 54:07.440
You should have run
her narrow ass over.

54:18.788 --> 54:21.086
So, this has all been
some kind of jive game

54:21.124 --> 54:23.058
- To get me out of the way?
- That's right.

54:23.093 --> 54:25.084
I was sent to destroy you

54:25.128 --> 54:27.062
and everything
the Brotherhood stands for.

54:38.541 --> 54:40.441
Damn it.

54:42.312 --> 54:44.746
Falling in love with you
wasn't part of the plan.

54:46.650 --> 54:48.311
Mmm.

54:52.422 --> 54:54.390
Oh, Undercover Brother,

54:54.424 --> 54:57.120
you're too much man for me.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.684
Baby...

54:58.728 --> 55:02.220
sometimes I'm too much man
for my own damn self.

55:06.670 --> 55:09.468
Mr. Feather,
your status report, please.

55:09.506 --> 55:12.566
All the pieces
of Operation Whitewash
are in place.

55:12.609 --> 55:14.907
Good. It's time
to extend the reach

55:14.944 --> 55:17.378
to black leaders
in sports, the arts,

55:17.414 --> 55:19.211
entertainment and business.

55:19.249 --> 55:21.683
Soon all aspects of society

55:21.718 --> 55:23.879
will once again be dominated
by The Man.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.252
It's time to strike
the final blow

55:26.289 --> 55:27.916
against the Brotherhood.

55:27.957 --> 55:30.323
So, when I return to the lair,

55:30.360 --> 55:33.523
Undercover Brother
better be dead.

55:33.563 --> 55:35.827
- Are we clear?
- Very good, sir.

55:35.865 --> 55:37.389
With Undercover
Brother dead,

55:37.434 --> 55:39.265
the Brotherhood
had best step correct,

55:39.302 --> 55:42.032
or their next move
will be their last.

55:42.072 --> 55:44.370
(clears throat)
Goodbye.

55:48.311 --> 55:50.279
Can I ask you something?

55:50.313 --> 55:52.304
Did I just say,

55:52.349 --> 55:54.442
"They had best
step correct"?

55:54.484 --> 55:56.418
Yes, sir. You did.

55:57.554 --> 55:58.851
You see what's happening?

55:58.888 --> 56:00.947
You see how we're
being corrupted by their

56:00.990 --> 56:03.015
hip-and-now fashion,
and their cool slang

56:03.059 --> 56:05.186
you can't help but use.
"Don't be dissing me!"

56:05.228 --> 56:06.923
- No!
- "It's all that!"

56:06.963 --> 56:10.194
You go, girl!
What's the dillio?

56:10.233 --> 56:12.565
Who let the dogs out?
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

56:12.602 --> 56:14.263
Whatcha talk about,
Willis?

56:14.304 --> 56:16.135
- You know
what I'm saying?!
- Uh...

56:16.172 --> 56:17.969
Little by little we're blending

56:18.007 --> 56:19.736
and merging until one day

56:19.776 --> 56:21.869
we're all going to be
one united people

56:21.911 --> 56:24.675
living and working
and dancing together,

56:24.714 --> 56:28.343
like the news or "Ally McBeal,"
or the people that work
at Saturn!

56:28.385 --> 56:31.081
And we've got to stop it
before it's too late!

56:33.289 --> 56:35.814
You heard The Man.
As of now,

56:35.859 --> 56:40.592
Operation Whitewash
goes global.

56:47.871 --> 56:50.738
Chief:
Jay-Z is doing Lawrence Welk's
Greatest Hits?!

56:50.774 --> 56:53.971
John Singleton to remake
"Driving Miss Daisy"?!

56:54.010 --> 56:57.946
Terry McMillan?
"How Stella Got Her
White Man Back"?

56:57.981 --> 56:59.778
Double damn it!

56:59.816 --> 57:02.444
Black people all over
the world are losing their damn minds.

57:02.485 --> 57:03.952
And look...

57:03.987 --> 57:07.582
they've all been exposed
to the General's fried chicken.

57:07.624 --> 57:09.285
Smart Brother, how's it coming
with this antidote?

57:09.325 --> 57:12.624
I found one.
But it only works on
one person at a time.

57:12.662 --> 57:14.823
We have to stop
this thing at the source.

57:16.032 --> 57:17.795
Undercover Brother,
you're back!

57:17.834 --> 57:19.825
(alarm blaring)

57:23.907 --> 57:24.839
Hi.

57:24.874 --> 57:27.707
Hell's wrong with you bringing
a white girl in my house?

57:28.211 --> 57:29.473
She's working
with us now, Chief.

57:29.512 --> 57:32.140
With my extensive
and intimate knowledge

57:32.182 --> 57:33.706
of The Man's organization,

57:33.750 --> 57:35.843
I can help you stop his evil plan.

57:35.885 --> 57:37.477
Okay.

57:37.520 --> 57:40.148
Smart Brother,
take White She-Devil to the lab

57:40.190 --> 57:41.851
and find out exactly
what she knows.

57:41.891 --> 57:45.054
You know, you're cute in
a Theo Huxtable kind of way.

57:45.094 --> 57:47.494
Really? Usually
I get Al Roker.

57:47.530 --> 57:50.158
"Here's what's happening
in your neck of the woods."

57:50.200 --> 57:52.760
Chief,
various brother agents,

57:52.802 --> 57:55.566
I owe all of you
a huge apology.

57:55.605 --> 57:58.096
I just watched this show...

57:58.141 --> 58:00.166
"Roots"?
Maybe you've heard of it?

58:00.210 --> 58:04.203
It taught me such
a profound lesson about bigotry.

58:04.247 --> 58:07.114
I have sat on the sidelines
of race relations long enough.

58:07.150 --> 58:10.950
I want to march down
that field of oppression

58:10.987 --> 58:13.455
and kick that ball of bigotry

58:13.490 --> 58:15.458
right over the goalpost

58:15.492 --> 58:17.483
of intolerance.

58:20.663 --> 58:22.790
(chuckles)

58:22.832 --> 58:25.323
Son, you talk
a lot of shit.
Yes, I do.

58:25.368 --> 58:28.360
But you down.

58:28.671 --> 58:30.832
What?
Are you kidding?

58:30.874 --> 58:33.001
You're going to let the white boy
join just like that?

58:33.042 --> 58:35.237
I was in secret agent school
for three years!

58:35.278 --> 58:37.508
Three years.
I paid for them classes myself.

58:37.547 --> 58:40.175
- You made me.
- Smart Brother: Chief. Chief.

58:40.216 --> 58:42.081
I performed a full range
spectral analysis

58:42.118 --> 58:43.949
on Miss White She-Devil's
brain waves.

58:43.987 --> 58:46.353
Then, I unlocked
her subconscious

58:46.389 --> 58:48.687
using a special form
of hypnosis.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.590
Then, I gently brushed
her hair.

58:50.627 --> 58:53.596
Then, I reached
deep within

58:53.630 --> 58:56.656
her tight little pockets
and I found a list

58:56.699 --> 58:58.360
of The Man's targets.

58:58.401 --> 58:59.459
Good Lord.

58:59.502 --> 59:00.935
They're going after
James Brown

59:00.970 --> 59:02.801
tomorrow night
at the Grammys.

59:02.839 --> 59:05.569
We need to stop him.
Find the General and give him the antidote.

59:05.608 --> 59:08.076
That's right.
It's goin' to the streets. Hey, y'all!

59:08.111 --> 59:10.102
It's revolution
up in this bitch!

59:10.146 --> 59:12.444
Set the alarm
to def-con five!

59:12.482 --> 59:14.382
It's on, baby. It's on.

59:14.417 --> 59:16.578
- Good work, White She-Devil.
- Thanks.

59:16.619 --> 59:20.248
Oh, you in too.
What the fuck?! Chief!

59:20.290 --> 59:22.656
I never see that bitch
in my secret agent classes!

59:22.692 --> 59:24.626
I'm still paying
the loans off, man!

59:24.661 --> 59:26.128
I sleep
on a pissy mattress.

59:26.162 --> 59:27.789
I ain't got
good food to eat!

59:27.830 --> 59:29.957
I borrow money
for my weed!

59:29.999 --> 59:32.797
I quit.
That's it.

59:32.835 --> 59:35.804
Y'all don't got
Conspiracy Brother Jones
to kick around anymore!

59:35.838 --> 59:38.102
Give me a pillow case!
I'm joining the Klan.

59:39.375 --> 59:41.605
Brother, we all love
your solo enthusiasm,

59:41.644 --> 59:43.805
but this is about
working together.

59:43.846 --> 59:46.007
Now, I've been a solo star
shooting the shots

59:46.049 --> 59:48.142
that I thought
would win the game.

59:48.184 --> 59:49.879
But in workin' with y'all,

59:49.919 --> 59:51.910
I've come to realize

59:51.955 --> 59:54.446
that only a team wins
a championship.

59:55.625 --> 59:57.923
Chief:
Teamwork! That's right.

59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.259
That's right.
I'm sorry, everybody.

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:02.093
Teamwork!
Now, let's go!

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:03.962
Hustle, hustle!
Come on, white girl!

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:10.295
(cheering)

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.608
Sistah Girl:
Best of luck tonight.

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.273
Have a great time.

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.782
We know The Man plans
to make his move tonight.

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.444
Now, Lance,
we're counting on you.

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:24.612
Don't get distracted,
be focused.

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:27.350
Stick close to the target
at all times.

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.153
Roger. Will do.

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:36.831
Boo.
Ah.

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:44.640
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen, James Brown.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:46.835
(crowd cheering)

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:52.213
- How you doing?
- James Brown.

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:54.546
- I want to see my fans.
- No, it's okay.

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.245
Wait a minute.
What's going on?

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:58.116
Perimeter search.
I'm on it.

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.246
What is that boy doing?

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:05.892
- What's going on here?
- Hey, Jimmy.

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:07.919
What?

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:10.228
Now, I feel good.

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:12.234
- God, man!
- (cheering continues)

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.963
Sistah Girl:
Lance. Lance!

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:17.971
Announcer:
The hardest working man
in show business.

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:21.799
Go get him.

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:26.513
Announcer:
Thank you, James Brown.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:28.776
No! Hey!
I just got promoted!

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.812
(groaning)

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.754
Mr. Feather:
Hello, Mr. James Brown.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:43.925
Hello-ooo, Mr. James Brown.

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.794
Ah!

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:50.328
Good God!

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:54.467
You will soon be administered
a drug that will make you...

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.415
The signal's stopped.

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:03.180
It's James Brown touchdown!

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:05.244
- That's James Brown?
- That's mustard.

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:08.587
I can't believe
I let him get away.
I am so stupid.

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:10.592
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:12.753
You got to stop
beating yourself up.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:15.093
We got to work together
as a team, okay?

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:17.031
Yeah, man.
Let the team do it.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.099
I'm playin' with him.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:23.264
Stop playin'.
Hey!

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:25.433
Damn.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.272
Hey, dawg. Hey.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.800
You need to lighten up.

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:31.040
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.378
Just be careful with this.
If you smoke too much,

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.611
it's going to have you
all paranoid and shit.

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:37.915
It takes time to build up
a tolerance like mine...

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.717
What? Did you hear that?
Shh. Shh.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.815
Hey, y'all,
did you hear something?

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.258
Shh, quiet!
There it goes again.

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:50.158
(horn blurting)

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.435
Guard:
Incoming vehicle!

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:56.131
- Don't you move!
- Hold it!

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.037
Don't you move!

01:02:58.074 --> 01:03:02.636
- Identify yourself!
- I'm with Island Fortress
Cleaning Service, sir.

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.703
Oh, okay.
Thank you.

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:07.238
- You so sweet.
- Just the janitors.

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:08.773
Let 'em through!

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.794
(coughs)

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.802
Smart Brother:
Lance. Lance!

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:34.766
So, Mr. Godfather of Soul...

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:37.143
- (snaps)
- (squirts)

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.839
...life as you've known it
will soon cease to exist.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:43.317
- (snaps)
- (squirts)

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:44.717
(clears throat)
Sorry.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:47.484
Any final requests?

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.593
Say it loud.

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:56.425
Say it loud!

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:58.228
(gasps)
What's he doing?

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.002
Say it loud!

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:09.438
- Say it loud!
- (grunting)

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:17.010
Say it loud!

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:20.955
- Say it loud!
- I'm black and I'm proud!

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.195
Hey, man, I want to get up
and do my thing now.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:31.429
## So good ##

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:32.934
## So good ##

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.460
## I got you... ##

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:37.802
- Oh.
- (gasping)

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.865
Hey!

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.609
I feel good.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.542
- (microphone feedback)
- It's time for the big payback.

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:48.140
(guns cock)

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:51.347
Very clever,
Mr. Undercover Brother.

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:54.481
- Whoa.
- Sistah Girl: Can you dig it?

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:58.621
Everything we'll need
to take it to The Man.

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:01.027
Hey, this isn't Taco Bell.

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:03.557
Can you find out
where the General is?

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:05.396
Just give me 10 minutes.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.561
- (alarm blaring)
- Conspiracy Brother: Oh, shit!

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.002
You've got one.

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:11.567
Mr. Elias:
Intruders.

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:14.235
The Brotherhood has breached
the communications room!

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:17.041
Everything's a party over here
with you people, isn't it?

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:20.139
That's not all.
The Man is on his way here.

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.979
Mr. Feather:
What? Now?

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:24.953
His helicopter will be here
in five minutes.

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:28.419
Mr. Elias,
would you kindly take care

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:31.085
of the nuisance
in the communication room?

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:33.254
Yes, sir.
Come on, let's go!

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.025
Yes, sir.
Right away.

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:37.589
- What have you done
with the General?
- General?

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.464
Could you come
in here, please?

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:44.731
General, if it's not
too much of a bother,

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.901
would you mind terribly,
killing this man?

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.305
Thank you.

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:57.643
So I can always have something
to remember you by.

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.416
Come on, hurry up.

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:02.383
I wouldn't move
if I were you.

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:04.723
Damn!
Oh, shit.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.352
Get off of me.
Sorry.

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:08.625
Excellent work,
White She-Devil.

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:10.928
Come here, baby.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.833
Damn, that girl
gets around.

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.505
How can you do this to me?

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:26.572
Once you've
had Undercover Brother,

01:06:26.615 --> 01:06:28.446
there is no other.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:33.119
No, it's once you go black,
you don't go back.

01:06:35.624 --> 01:06:37.057
It's the honky patrol.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.526
Let me do this.

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.029
Ah, look who got
the gun now.

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:42.724
- Yeah. What's up?!
- Hi.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:43.857
- Shut up!
- What?

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:46.197
I said shut up, whitey!
I got the power.

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.935
Keep working.

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.964
This is a girl thing.

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.447
- Breakdance.
- Break, what?

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:07.354
I said, breakdance.
Come on.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:08.948
Take it!

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:11.459
That's right.
That's good.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:13.223
Come on.
Kid 'n Play.

01:07:13.262 --> 01:07:14.991
- Kid and who?
- Come on.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:19.496
That's right.
Getting funky.

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:24.132
Oh, yeah.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:26.038
I like black people.

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:31.711
Oh, fight.

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:34.079
Watch yourself.
Show 'em what you're working with.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:36.343
Oh!

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:40.151
White She-Devil,
represent!

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.117
AIl: Oh!

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.662
- Sistah Girl: Yeah.
- I got him.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:49.823
I got him!
Vector four, section seven.

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:54.025
Come on, General,
you got to give me that gun.

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:57.602
Nonsense!
General, kill him!

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.972
(mimicking gunshots)

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:11.781
Undercover Brother,
are you okay?

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.812
Everything's cool
now that you're here.

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:18.149
Y'all gonna make me lose
my mind up in here!

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:22.631
See what I've been
dealing with?

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:24.131
Yeah.

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.796
Situation complete.
We'll see you soon, Chief.

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:32.371
Atomic core, eh?

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:36.667
Let's see what this so-called
button does.

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:39.576
- (alarm blaring)
- Computer voice: Attention,

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.947
atomic core set to overload.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:44.544
My bad.

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.487
Here, General,
take the antidote.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:49.850
- Oh, what happened to me?
- (alarm continues)

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.689
Damn!

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:58.393
You guys get
the General out of here.
I'm going after The Man.

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:01.426
Let's get while
the getting's good.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.993
There'll be another day
to fight The Man.

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:05.029
We can't give The Man
another damn day!

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:08.270
But Sistah Girl's right.
We got to get the hell out of here, man.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.210
We're gonna die!
We're all gonna die!

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.737
- Dig it! Dig it hard!
- Daddy!

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:15.375
There's times for falling apart,
and there's times for getting funky.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.612
This is one
of those funky times!

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.917
So, what's it going to be?!

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:22.719
Are you ready to play
some funky music, white boy?

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.292
Solid.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:32.993
Lay down the boogie.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.964
It's time to take it
to The Man.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.907
I guess this means you
and I are like brothers now, huh?

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.807
I feel black.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.142
Man, you look white!

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.546
Ow.
Don't touch me!

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.049
Come on, General.
Let's go.

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:49.812
Let's go!
Let's get out of here!

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.786
- Come on!
- Go. Come on, nigga.

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:56.584
Computer voice:
Atomic core overload in five minutes.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.923
Please exit
in an orderly fashion.

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.485
Stop him!

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.971
(karate yell)

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:20.177
Earth, wind and fire!

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:22.978
Shaquille O'Neal!

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:26.852
- Sisqo!
- No-ooo!

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.515
(screams)

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.089
(crunch)

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:38.462
I just bought those.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.024
Sorry about that.

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:54.779
It's all over, man!

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.586
You want some drama?

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.454
Then bring it.

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:06.759
Lance, protect the General
at all costs.

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:10.356
Atomic core overload
in three minutes.

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:14.798
Let me talk to them.
I'm white.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.040
We don't want
any trouble.

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.838
What are you going
to do about it?

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.811
Sissy.

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.679
I am not

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:29.707
a sissy!

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.259
Come on!

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.546
Oh.
Ugh!

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:01.344
Lance.

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:05.080
He shouldn't
have called me a sissy.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.917
(neck cracks)

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:09.617
Conspiracy Brother:
Not bad, whitey.

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:12.650
But if it was me, I would have ripped
his spine out of his ass!

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:16.131
Let's go! We got less than a minute
before this place blows!

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:19.267
(Michael Jackson's
"Beat lt" playing)

01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:41.952
## They told him don't you ever
come around here ##

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:44.584
## Don't wanna see your face,
you better disappear ##

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:48.027
## The fire's in their eyes
and their words are really clear ##

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:51.260
## So beat it, just beat it ##

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.132
## You better run,
you better do what you can ##

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:59.072
## Don't wanna see no blood,
don't be a macho man ##

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:02.043
## You wanna be tough,
better do what you can ##

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:05.410
## So beat it,
but you wanna be bad ##

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:08.211
## Just beat it, beat it ##

and strong is your fight ##

## It doesn't matter
who's wrong or right ##

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:20.925

## Just beat it ##

## Just beat it ##

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.791
## Just beat it ##

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.455
## Beat it... ##

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:50.083
- General, sir,
are you all right?
- Yes.

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.992
There he is!
Undercover Brother!

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:54.928
He's only got
a few seconds!

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.770
- (music stops)
- Oops.

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:27.887
You mess with the 'fro,
you got to go.

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:46.003
(squeals)

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.677
(chuckles, yells)

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.881
I believe
this belongs to me.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.787
(laughs)

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:39.767
So long,
Undercover Brother.

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.928
He's failed me.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.097
Leave him.

01:15:44.139 --> 01:15:47.131
Hey! Don't be dissing me!

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:49.370
(sputtering)

01:15:56.718 --> 01:16:00.085
Hey! Let me in!

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.585
Let me up!

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:13.098
(screams)

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.406
That Feather
went out like a sucka.

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.411
Punk ass bitch
played himself.

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:25.709
Let's bounce, dawg.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.425
(screaming)

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:54.808
No! He doesn't have
his parachute!

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.220
(cheering)

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:17.632
- Yeah.
- (applause)

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.395
Smart Brother:
Come on over here. Hug me.

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:24.169
## What you knowin' ##

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:26.504
## To be real ##

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:31.809
## What you thinkin' ##

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.974
## I think I love you, baby... ##

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:36.416
Undercover Brother,
you the baddest.

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:38.942
Didn't I blow
your mind this time?

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:40.386
Didn't I?

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:43.050
Didn't you cause about
a bazillion dollars worth
of damage?

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:44.956
And I sure as hell ain't
covering for you!

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.654
I don't give a damn
how sexy you look

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:48.094
floating down
in your little pants!

01:17:48.563 --> 01:17:50.360
And as for the rest
of you...

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:55.762
I just want to say

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:58.773
how very proud I am
of all of you.

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:00.434
(clears throat)

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:03.603
Undercover Brother,
the world is safe once again

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:05.010
thanks to you.

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.571
No thanks to me, Chief.

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:09.413
I couldn't have done it
without Sistah Girl.

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.214
You know what they say,

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:13.380
"Behind every great
black man..."

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:16.050
Is the police.

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:18.059
- Uh, no, no.
- A bunch of slow white athletes?

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.219
- No.
- A cute butt?

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.729
- Probable cause?
- No!

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:24.357
A strong black woman.

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:26.264
- Strong black woman.
- That's right.

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.700
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:29.727
It would've been cool
to have a Latino,

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.329
a Native American,
Asian,

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.807
even a Jewish guy
in the mix.

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:36.140
The point is,
by working together as one,

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:37.805
we got the job done.

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:41.509
No doubt, that's what
the Brotherhood is all about.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.015
Solid.

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:47.014
Oh!

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:49.817
Look out, y'all,
fallin' rocks!

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:50.916
Shotgun!

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:53.359
Narrator:
Having stopped Operation Whitewash,

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:57.627
the Brotherhood distributed
an antidote to the mind control drug

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.258
to black people nationwide.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.098
And though The Man escaped,

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:03.331
the Brotherhood had found their hero.

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:05.305
Thanks to Undercover Brother,

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.503
the world was once again
a funky place.

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:11.979
## We want the funk,
give up the funk ##

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.607
- ## Everybody say ##

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:17.545
## We got to have that funk ##

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.884
## A is for apples and J is for jack ##

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.786
## P is for punk

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:24.690
## On track with this phat rap

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:27.126
## All around the world

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:29.357
## In bump we thrust and trust ##

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:31.228
## Man, you can't funk with us ##

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.427
## Cold as a motha',

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:36.096
## 'Cause they just want a piece
of the Undercover Brother ##

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:38.504
## They'll take him home tonight
'cause he's so dynamite ##

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.974
## Sort of like dolomite,

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:43.000
## I got a little something

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:45.512

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:47.344

01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:49.816
## I'm just funkin'

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.251
## Where did you get

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.754
## Let's get ready to shoop ##

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:56.587

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.825
## Yeah, baby ##

## Get up off the funk. ####

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:12.206
(clapping)

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.314
## Work and work ##

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:32.952
## Well, those cars

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.518

(knock on door)

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:38.771
Damn, who is that?

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:41.213
Hold that thought
and that feelin', baby.

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:43.513
Just let it percolate.
I'll be right back.

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:46.281
- (knocking continues)
- Hurry up, baby.

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:53.257
Hi.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:56.695
Uh, White She-Devil,
what you doing here?

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:59.131
Remember? You told me
to come over.

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:01.658
And me and you
and Sistah Girl

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.136
could make Oreos.

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:04.160
Shh.

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:05.638
Sweet and black
on both sides

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:09.074
with a dreamy white filling
in the middle.

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.442
Then I realized...
you can't make Oreos.

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:13.538
So, I bought some.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:19.050
Some people got jungle fever.
She got the flu.

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:21.749
