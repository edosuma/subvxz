WEBVTT

00:18.185 --> 00:20.285
JESS:
The guys and I are about
to leave for the airport,

00:20.287 --> 00:22.054
and I'm so excited to see you.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.890
Is that Ryan?
- I can't wait for you
to see my hometown.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.126
It's going to be just like
<i>An Affair to Remember,</i>

00:27.128 --> 00:29.628
only instead of the Empire State
Building on New Year's Eve,

00:29.630 --> 00:31.830
it's going to be a winery
near the Portland airport

00:31.832 --> 00:33.232
at my dad's wedding.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.668
Anyway, I love you, I miss you.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.304
(Schmidt groans)
Hello? Hello?

00:39.306 --> 00:40.839
Sounds like I lost you
for a minute!

00:40.841 --> 00:41.874
(chuckles)

00:41.876 --> 00:43.308
Are you there?!

00:43.310 --> 00:45.844
Where's my widdle Eng-wish man?

00:45.846 --> 00:48.380
And with that, Ryan walked
into the River Thames

00:48.382 --> 00:50.349
and accepted death.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.384
The joke's on you, 'cause
I wasn't even talking to him.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.386
I was leaving a voice mail.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.055
Haven't talked to him
for a week.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.490
Are you guys making
a group face?

00:58.492 --> 00:59.525
No, we're not...
- No.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.392
Nah.
- Guys, look,

01:00.394 --> 01:02.161
Ryan and I are great.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.595
Really? 'Cause he
doesn't call enough.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.264
And when he does,
it's in the middle of the night.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.498
Ryan didn't want
to move to England,

01:06.500 --> 01:07.833
he had to move to England.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.401
For the last couple of weeks,

01:09.403 --> 01:11.570
you've been keeping Nick hours,
and... and it's ugly.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.406
Hey. Sorry.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.208
I was talking to Ryan
before he went to work

01:16.210 --> 01:17.843
and I must have fallen asleep.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.779
Friend to friend,
am I wearing pants?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.381
The situation isn't ideal,

01:22.383 --> 01:25.717
however, long distance
is super romantic.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.786
Plus I don't have to shave
my legs every day

01:27.788 --> 01:28.887
which is a real plus.

01:28.889 --> 01:29.955
You know, Fawn shaves herself

01:29.957 --> 01:31.356
from toe to chin.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.758
Every single day.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.760
God, I love my girlfriend.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.695
Hey.
- Oh, Cece.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.197
CECE: Yeah, what?
Huge news.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.299
Jake Apex is coming
to the wedding.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.934
Jake Apex?

01:41.936 --> 01:43.268
Who is Jake Apex?

01:43.270 --> 01:44.970
Jake Apex is Cece's
high school crush.

01:44.972 --> 01:48.807
Never did anything for me,
but turned Cece to soup.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.776
Thanks.
- Mm. Yeah.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.211
Is he one of them
Portland hippies?

01:52.213 --> 01:53.212
'Cause I hate
them Portland hippies.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.213
CECE:
He is a legend.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.747
Every time I spoke to him,

01:55.749 --> 01:57.950
I'd have a full-blown
tiny kid stroke.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.751
Hey, killer.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.720
I... d... uh... mm...

02:01.722 --> 02:03.288
(sputters)

02:03.290 --> 02:05.791
Yeah, well, I got a bad
feeling about this guy.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.926
Why, because he's bomb
and Cece wants some?

02:07.928 --> 02:09.761
No. Other reasons.

02:09.763 --> 02:13.465
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to go water my succulents.

02:18.405 --> 02:19.471
How do you know Apex is so cute?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.472
I just assumed.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.474
Winston, stop with
the look, okay?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.976
Otherwise I will murder you

02:23.978 --> 02:25.611
and clean up your blood
with your cat.

02:25.613 --> 02:29.581
All right? For the 50th time,
I do not like Schmidt.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.250
Good luck finding my cat.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.418
You know, I haven't
seen him in weeks.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.420
My best man suit.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.788
Oh.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.190
I'm my dad's best man.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.726
He wanted a boy.
My middle name's Christopher.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.733
Yeah.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.609
¶ You're scheming on a thing,
that's sabotage ¶

02:57.611 --> 03:01.547
¶ I can't stand it,
I know you planned it ¶

03:01.549 --> 03:03.649
¶ I'm-a set it straight,
this Watergate... ¶

03:03.651 --> 03:05.317
The Co-Pays are awesome.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.286
I can't believe they're
also pharmacists.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.788
¶ I'm-a Buddy Rich
when I fly off the handle ¶

03:09.790 --> 03:12.658
¶ What could it be?
It's a mirage ¶

03:12.660 --> 03:15.294
¶ You're scheming on a thing,
that's sabotage. ¶

03:15.296 --> 03:16.695
MAN:
That's really good.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.963
(applauding, whooping)

03:17.965 --> 03:20.199
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.366
This is a nice place.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.402
I mean, it's not the best
vineyard in Portland.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.704
Here we go.
That's Bartleby Cellars,
of course.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.306
How would you
even know that?

03:27.308 --> 03:28.974
Whenever Coach
goes to a new city,

03:28.976 --> 03:31.510
he learns all about it,
like a real weirdo.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.178
I was an army brat,
all right?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.247
I moved a lot.
Assimilating was key.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.148
Oh, and by the way,

03:36.150 --> 03:37.549
calling somebody weird
in Portland

03:37.551 --> 03:39.418
is actually a compliment,
so thank you, Nick.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.852
Hey, oh.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.387
It's just... Oh.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.889
Sorry, I thought I heard
my phone ringing.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.191
Ryan's supposed to call me
before he gets on the plane.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.427
Oh! Sorry.
- Jess, just take
your phone out.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.262
No, Nick, I want
to be here with you guys.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.197
I want to... Sorry.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.265
I just want to...

03:53.267 --> 03:54.266
Sorry.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.767
Does anybody else hear buzzing?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.402
No.
- No, 'cause it's not buzzing.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.271
No, honey, but, you know, he's
going to be here soon, okay?

03:59.273 --> 04:00.272
Yeah.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.341
Are you guys
still touring the city?

04:02.343 --> 04:04.543
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.246
I made about 12 drafts
of this map.

04:07.248 --> 04:08.547
Couldn't figure out where to go.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.916
Had to fit 18 years
into one morning.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.351
So, here it is.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.186
Aw.
- I'm so excited to show
him Portland,

04:14.188 --> 04:16.521
and my mom is so excited
to meet him.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.924
And I'm going to show him...

04:18.926 --> 04:20.392
Jess, it's not buzzing.
It's not buzzing.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.027
I promise you it's not.
It's not buzzing.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.862
Oh, there's my dad.
Hey, guys.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.397
Sounded great.
You sounded great.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.366
You look terrific, too.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.767
Hey!

04:28.769 --> 04:31.203
Oh, there's
my daughter.
- Oh...

04:31.205 --> 04:34.273
I thought we talked about
you not calling me that.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.741
Yeah, yeah.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.409
Hey, how's the food?

04:37.411 --> 04:38.877
I haven't eaten
in three weeks.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.412
Trying to fit into
my wedding dress.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.813
(laughs)

04:41.815 --> 04:43.548
Had a dream about
a crouton last night.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.816
And, um...

04:44.818 --> 04:47.786
And that was
the whole dream.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.655
Ooh, before I forget,

04:49.657 --> 04:50.756
best man.

04:50.758 --> 04:51.757
(chuckles)
- Aw.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.924
The wedding rings.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.727
Hey, I want you to meet
a bunch of relatives

04:55.729 --> 04:57.229
that are all going to be
dead in a couple of years.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.764
Oh, good idea.
- Oh.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.232
Hey, what happened
to the British guy?

05:00.234 --> 05:01.566
He's coming tomorrow.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.269
MAN:
Hey, Jake.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.571
Jake Apex. That's him.
That's him right there.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.340
WINSTON:
I will say one thing
about that man

05:08.342 --> 05:11.443
that I've only said about
Ryan Gosling-- hot damn!

05:11.445 --> 05:12.444
What's up, Winston?

05:12.446 --> 05:13.578
I'm gonna just go...

05:13.580 --> 05:14.579
I'm gonna go talk
to him, yeah.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.248
WINSTON:
You're good.
- Yup.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.150
You're okay.
- Gonna...

05:18.152 --> 05:19.951
I didn't know that
was a thing. You...

05:19.953 --> 05:21.820
Okay.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.658
(inaudible)

05:26.660 --> 05:28.827
SCHMIDT:
Oh, this is very hard to watch.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.329
It's like when Bob Costas

05:30.331 --> 05:31.296
had that eye infection
at the O-Lympics.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.098
You mean the Olympics.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.067
(Cece laughing hard)

05:36.036 --> 05:38.337
(whoops)

05:39.306 --> 05:41.506
Okay. Oh, God.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.874
Okay, what happened?

05:42.876 --> 05:44.276
Did I look cool?

05:44.278 --> 05:46.278
Uh...
- Define "cool."

05:46.280 --> 05:48.146
What happened? I don't know
what hap... I blacked out.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.314
Okay, look, Cece--

05:49.316 --> 05:51.183
I'm gonna help you.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.185
I'm Usher, you're Bieber.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.953
And Jake Apex

05:54.955 --> 05:56.221
is all the hot tracks

05:56.223 --> 05:57.222
that we're going
to make together.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.391
Hey.
- Hey.

05:59.393 --> 06:03.895
So, um... Ryan's not coming.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.131
Oh, boy.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.232
He has to work
on Monday

06:07.234 --> 06:08.734
and he thought, ultimately,

06:08.736 --> 06:10.235
it didn't make sense,
which makes sense.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.503
It's not
a big deal.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.039
But the tour's canceled.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.409
(in Southern accent):
Hey, Randy, the tour's canceled.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.380
(in normal voice):
I don't know why I did that.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.881
Anyway, go ahead, Nick.
Go ahead.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.716
Talk about how
much this sucks.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.318
Tell me that Ryan's not coming

06:26.320 --> 06:28.186
'cause he's a blank
who's a blank.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.021
I do have one thing to say.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.592
While you were away,
we were all talking

06:33.594 --> 06:36.495
about how much we wanted
to go on the tour.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.598
So don't cancel it.
We'll do it with you!

06:39.600 --> 06:41.366
Really?
- Yeah!

06:41.368 --> 06:42.267
Yeah!
Yes!

06:42.269 --> 06:43.368
Really?

06:43.370 --> 06:44.569
Yes!
- Fired up.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.705
We haven't stopped
talking about...
- Yeah, man.

06:46.707 --> 06:47.506
Couldn't be more excited.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.840
All 18 places!

06:48.842 --> 06:50.776
There's 18?
- Wow.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.544
I'm going to add
a few more stops, then.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.546
I definitely know you'd enjoy
the Shakespeare Garden.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.148
Ha-ha, great.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.087
Guys, Jess says she's fine,
but I know she's not.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.688
Okay?
She needs cheering up.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.923
We're in her hometown.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.291
I can't believe
Ryan bailed.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.259
I'm not happy
with what Ryan's doing.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.894
It's, it's not cool.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.030
But today,
it's all sunshine and smiles.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.532
Hey, hey, hey, hey--
let me, let me get sunshine.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.733
Let me get sunshine.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.934
Okay, yeah,
you can be sunshine.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.636
Yes! (laughs)

07:17.638 --> 07:19.237
Here she is--
sunshine and smiles!

07:19.239 --> 07:21.373
(all cheering)

07:21.375 --> 07:22.974
Jess!
- WINSTON:
Sending the sun in!

07:22.976 --> 07:24.109
Hi.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.210
So... I'm sorry
this is so small.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.813
It was just meant
for Ryan and me.

07:27.815 --> 07:28.814
No worries.
- No problem.
- It's great.

07:28.816 --> 07:29.815
Your shoes look super-cute.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.483
You look great.
You look great.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.285
Let's see if... Ryan...
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.321
Give me that purse!
No more checking in with Ryan.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.756
The tour starts now.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.025
(all cheering)

07:41.395 --> 07:42.994
JESS: And there's
the Italian soda shop

07:42.996 --> 07:45.597
where I first learning
what a "not" joke was.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.598
Not!

07:46.600 --> 07:48.266
I... I learned it, actually,

07:48.268 --> 07:49.768
in the candle shop, next-door.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.037
People don't really do
"not" jokes anymore.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.340
Not! They'll be in forever!

07:55.342 --> 07:57.008
Right, guys?
- Not!

07:57.010 --> 07:58.176
(laughs)

07:58.178 --> 07:59.845
JESS:
And there's the dance studio

07:59.847 --> 08:01.279
where I had my first kiss

08:01.281 --> 08:03.982
with the cutest/only boy
in my jazz troupe.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.351
Then he came out
of the closet-- super gay.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.786
Then we kissed some more.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.621
Then he went to Oberlin.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:10.624 --> 08:12.123
Stop in that store!

08:12.125 --> 08:13.992
I'm going full Portland, people.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.530
I'm so Portland right now,
they all staring at me

08:18.532 --> 08:20.432
like, "Is that the
president of Portland?"

08:20.434 --> 08:21.533
(laughing)

08:21.535 --> 08:23.301
I'm like, "No."

08:23.303 --> 08:26.638
This is the very pizza place
where we'd dab our pizzas

08:26.640 --> 08:28.473
with our napkins,
to get the grease off,

08:28.475 --> 08:31.543
and then we'd make
this kid named Joey

08:31.545 --> 08:33.111
eat the napkins.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.380
(laughing)

08:35.382 --> 08:36.982
I'm not gonna lie...
(forced laugh)

08:36.984 --> 08:38.750
I'm Joey.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.319
Hmm.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.487
(gasping):
Oh, my God.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.856
CECE:
Oh, no, he's here.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.325
He's here.
He just walked in.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.493
Oh, is he a firefighter?

08:48.495 --> 08:49.961
Seems pretty easy
in Portland, huh?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.296
(chuckles)
Rain just does the work for you.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.298
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.867
No! Do... do not go
and talk to him.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.469
Do not go
and talk to him.

08:57.471 --> 09:00.472
Cece, not everything's
about you, you narcissist.

09:00.474 --> 09:02.641
All right, just...
go to the bathroom,

09:02.643 --> 09:04.109
like you said you'd...

09:05.379 --> 09:07.212
And... he's talking to him.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.247
Just don't look.
Just don't look.
Oh, well, he's looking at you.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.315
What?
- What? Really?
No, like, right now,

09:10.317 --> 09:11.617
he's staring at you.

09:11.618 --> 09:12.918
Don't, don't, don't,
don't look, don't look.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.686
Don't look.
- The cutest one's
looking right at me.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.422
I don't see a "cute" or
"not cute" one, Coach.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.824
If you had to choose,
which one's the cutest?

09:19.826 --> 09:20.926
Way to the left.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.563
(whispering):
I'm super nervous.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.764
Now my hands are sweating.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.032
Then wipe 'em off.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.400
If he comes over
and shakes your hand,

09:28.402 --> 09:29.367
you don't want
sweaty hands.
- Oh, my God!

09:29.369 --> 09:31.169
SCHMIDT:
He said he thinks you're cute.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.071
CECE:
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

09:33.073 --> 09:34.372
JESS: Hey, Nick,
can I have my phone?

09:34.374 --> 09:36.107
You know what?
Never mind. I don't care.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.411
So this is my childhood home,

09:39.413 --> 09:41.012
the place of my birth.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.847
Thank you guys so much
for doing this,

09:42.849 --> 09:44.282
and coming on
this tour with me.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.618
I forgot all about...

09:46.620 --> 09:50.021
(with British accent):
Hello, hello, hello, darling!

09:50.023 --> 09:52.757
("God Save the Queen" playing)

09:52.759 --> 09:55.860
Where's the famous
Mr. Geauxinue?

09:55.862 --> 09:57.395
JESS:
Um... well...

09:57.397 --> 09:59.230
actually, um, Ryan...

09:59.232 --> 10:01.533
had to cancel last-minute,
so he's not coming.

10:01.535 --> 10:03.535
I'm so sorry.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.971
Oh, honey...

10:05.973 --> 10:07.372
that's just awful.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.974
Aw...

10:08.976 --> 10:10.976
Damn men.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.378
Oh, I feel so bad for you.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.380
Hey, Mom... Mom...
Oh, honey...

10:15.382 --> 10:17.082
Um...

10:17.084 --> 10:20.085
don't get emotional, okay?

10:20.087 --> 10:22.387
'Cause if you get emotional,
I'll get emotional.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.655
Let's talk about
happy stuff.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.156
Did you guys
see the video of

10:25.158 --> 10:26.958
the panda farting
and falling of a branch?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.226
(everyone laughing)

10:28.228 --> 10:29.794
Pretty crazy, man.
It was funny. It was funny.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.929
WINSTON:
It made me laugh.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.231
Who wants scramblies?

10:33.233 --> 10:34.432
You know I do, Mom.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.800
(voice breaking):
Good.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.471
(crying)

10:46.246 --> 10:47.245
Look, this might not be
the right time

10:47.247 --> 10:48.847
to say this, you guys, but, uh,

10:48.849 --> 10:50.649
should we take a straw poll
on this whole Cosby thing?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.350
JESS:
I just want to clarify

10:52.352 --> 10:55.420
to everyone here
that I am fine.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.755
Which is why I'm fine.

10:56.757 --> 10:57.756
Great!
- Yeah.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.257
Finer than fine.
Mm-hmm.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.326
COACH: Which is why I'm fine.
SCHMIDT: Fantastic!

11:01.328 --> 11:02.360
CECE: I'm fine, too.
Everybody's great.
SCHMIDT: Perfect.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.029
(stifled crying)

11:04.031 --> 11:05.630
I'm not fine!

11:05.632 --> 11:07.298
NICK:
I can't do this anymore.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.034
It's not all smiles
and sunshine.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.002
It's not!

11:11.004 --> 11:13.204
Look, Ryan bailed
and that's a dick move.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.839
And that's the truth.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.343
(crying): I'm fine, I'm
just gonna go to my room.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.679
(crying):
I made scones.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.047
(door slams)

11:22.049 --> 11:24.049
Was that sunshine
or smiles? Hmm?

11:24.051 --> 11:25.884
(rock music blaring)

11:25.886 --> 11:28.019
Oh...

11:28.021 --> 11:29.688
Joanie... (chuckles)

11:29.690 --> 11:32.323
I don't want to lie
to you, so I'm not--

11:32.325 --> 11:34.359
there's shells
all in these eggs.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.165
So, Joan, how do you, uh, feel
about Bob getting remarried?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.633
Mm! Oh, I'm fine.

11:41.635 --> 11:43.301
I just feel bad for Ashley.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.502
I mean, let's just say

11:44.504 --> 11:46.337
he's a man with
a healthy appetite,

11:46.339 --> 11:48.506
except one thing.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.208
(coughing)

11:50.210 --> 11:51.409
Well, that's a visual.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.244
I don't really
have a burning desire

11:53.246 --> 11:54.679
to stick around
for the wedding,

11:54.681 --> 11:56.314
so I'm going on a trip

11:56.316 --> 11:58.650
with some friends.
- Hmm!

11:58.652 --> 12:01.419
A trip I've never taken before.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.754
Hmm!

12:06.059 --> 12:07.892
(rock music blaring)

12:10.430 --> 12:12.664
Hey!
You mind if I turn this down?

12:12.666 --> 12:14.733
(volume decreases)

12:14.735 --> 12:17.502
"AP Stat Jams."

12:17.504 --> 12:19.170
Advanced Placement.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.339
Very smart.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.242
How many Lilith Fairs
did you go to?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.411
Oh, Method Man
performed at that one?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.046
It's Liliths Fair.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.348
Like "passersby..."

12:30.350 --> 12:31.916
or "attorneys general."

12:31.918 --> 12:34.953
Well, look, I came to,
uh... give you this.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.922
Text Ryan as much as you want,
it's none of my business.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.458
I just think long-distance
relationships suck.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.762
I once broke up with
a woman who lived in Irvine,

12:43.764 --> 12:45.296
and that's only 30 minutes away.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.766
Mind you, I had hornets
living in my car at the time,

12:47.768 --> 12:49.300
which was a factor,

12:49.302 --> 12:51.269
but the commute was also
a big part of it.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.771
Well, look, Nick,
we're different,

12:52.773 --> 12:54.105
and just because
it's difficult with Ryan,

12:54.107 --> 12:55.240
doesn't mean we're doomed.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.775
We're star-crossed
lovers.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.943
We're like Kate and Leo...

12:58.945 --> 13:02.313
or... Claire and Leo, or...

13:02.315 --> 13:05.150
whatever blonde Leo
is taking on boats.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.484
They're all doomed.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.319
Leo ain't gonna settle down--
he ain't ready.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.956
I'm a hopeless romantic,
and I always have been.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.792
Which is why...

13:13.794 --> 13:16.261
I mean, it's a nice notion,
it's just...

13:16.263 --> 13:18.963
...from 1994 to 2001,

13:18.965 --> 13:21.432
I believed that
Jordan Catalano

13:21.434 --> 13:23.168
was gonna show up
in my driveway

13:23.170 --> 13:24.569
after a dirt bike accident,

13:24.571 --> 13:27.972
all scruffy and...
beautiful...

13:27.974 --> 13:31.009
and he would need
a bath and some...

13:31.011 --> 13:32.577
medical attention.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.445
You think that little boy
is driving a dirt bike?

13:34.447 --> 13:36.815
He looks a lot like you.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.817
That's me,
that's Jordan Catalano.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.418
I honestly couldn't
tell the difference.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.820
I swear to God.
I'm not trying to be mean.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.922
You know what the problem
with Jordan Catalano is?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.257
Yeah-- an undiagnosed
learning disability.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.126
Oh, I didn't know the boy
had mental problems--

13:48.128 --> 13:49.294
I wouldn't be
teasing him, but...

13:49.296 --> 13:52.330
No, it's that he's fake.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.299
The only thing that matters

13:54.301 --> 13:57.435
is if the guy is there for you
when you need him.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.674
Otherwise,
you're dating a wall.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.976
I have to get
to my dad's wedding.
- I didn't...

14:04.978 --> 14:06.978
I didn't come in here
trying to be harsh, I'm ju...

14:06.980 --> 14:09.047
I was trying to be helpful
and it's not working

14:09.049 --> 14:10.215
and I apologize.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.750
I was coming in
as a friend, Je...

14:16.556 --> 14:18.723
I'm sure that's just her.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.494
Well, the dream's dead.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.196
Apparently,
Jake Apex has to work,

14:25.198 --> 14:27.065
so he's not gonna
come to the wedding.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.667
I'm wearing the craziest
underwear for nothing.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.003
Okay, look, Cece, you know
what we do? We regroup.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.471
No, it's fine, Schmidt.
I'm over it.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.907
It is not fine.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.409
Look, Cece, you're the most
amazing woman I ever met.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.346
If you want Jake Apex,

14:41.348 --> 14:44.482
I'm gonna help you
get Jake Apex.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.318
I'm never gonna stop trying
to make you happy, Cece.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.089
I promise you, for
the rest of my...

14:51.091 --> 14:52.323
(phone ringing)

14:52.325 --> 14:53.992
Oh, look at that,
it's Fawn.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.260
Hello, Councilwoman Moscato.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.328
(quietly):
Oh, yeah.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.264
(panting):
Guys!

14:59.266 --> 15:00.999
I forgot the rings at the house.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.767
They're in my purse
in my room.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.435
And now I have to go
get my dad ready.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.871
Apparently, he's wearing
some kind of a male corset.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.706
All right, Coach and I
will get the rings...

15:08.708 --> 15:10.008
You don't have a car.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.176
All right.
- Okay.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.778
Wait!

15:13.780 --> 15:15.346
All right.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.881
Let's do this.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.549
(chuckles):
Yeah.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.550
Okay.
- Okay.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.452
Okay, ready?
- Yep, yep.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.955
Go easy.
- I'm not on!

15:23.957 --> 15:27.225
You're not?!
I'm not on! I'm not on!

15:27.227 --> 15:28.726
You don't have
the rings?!

15:28.728 --> 15:30.261
Well, Dad, hold on...
You don't have the rings?!

15:30.263 --> 15:32.363
Oh! Damn it, no!
That's...

15:32.365 --> 15:33.231
No, this is bad.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.732
We're doomed!

15:34.734 --> 15:36.200
You look beautiful,
but we are doomed.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.235
(groans)

15:37.237 --> 15:39.237
Oh, yeah.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.205
(sighs)

15:41.207 --> 15:43.074
I wish these were
filled with ground beef.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.242
(ringtone playing)

15:44.244 --> 15:46.377
Oh, wait, this is Nick!
Nick's calling!

15:46.379 --> 15:48.146
He's probably walking
in the door. Here.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.147
Hey.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.214
I found the purse,

15:50.216 --> 15:51.616
but your mom has the rings.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.084
What? (chuckles)

15:53.086 --> 15:54.419
Can you ask her for them?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.321
Yeah, it's a little
hard right now.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.324
Remember she said
she was going on a trip?

15:59.326 --> 16:00.792
(women laughing, howling)

16:08.168 --> 16:09.734
It's gonna be a hair longer.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.703
It's acid, isn't it?

16:16.276 --> 16:18.609
What is taking them so long?

16:18.611 --> 16:21.145
(laughs):
Hi!

16:21.147 --> 16:24.315
Um... so the wedding
will begin shortly.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.284
(crowd sighs)
But first,

16:26.286 --> 16:29.187
I'm gonna start you off
with a crowd-pleasing,

16:29.189 --> 16:31.656
nondenominational--

16:31.658 --> 16:33.825
something in it for everyone--
(chuckles)

16:33.827 --> 16:35.393
"Ave Maria."

16:36.763 --> 16:41.566
¶ Ah... ¶

16:44.137 --> 16:46.337
(continues holding note)

16:47.707 --> 16:49.140
¶ Ve... ¶

16:49.142 --> 16:52.710
(continues holding note)

16:52.712 --> 16:53.945
Joan, I need you to focus.

16:53.947 --> 16:55.279
I need you to help me

16:55.281 --> 16:56.981
find those rings.
- (grunts)

16:56.983 --> 16:58.282
We have the rings.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.517
They all-- all of you...
We all have the rings.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.285
Everyone's got the ring.
Come into the womb.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.521
Come into the womb.
I don't want to
come in the womb.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.324
Come into the womb.
I'm not a womb guy!
I'm not a womb guy!

17:06.326 --> 17:09.027
¶ Mari... ¶

17:09.029 --> 17:11.195
(continues holding note)

17:11.197 --> 17:13.131
Show me the rings!
The womb.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.132
WOMEN (chanting):
Reverse. Birth.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.700
Can I just see that?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.335
Reverse. Birth.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.336
That's not it.

17:18.338 --> 17:22.473
¶ Ah... ¶

17:24.477 --> 17:26.177
¶ Ah... ¶

17:26.179 --> 17:27.512
WOMEN (chanting):
Reverse. Birth.
Here we go!

17:27.514 --> 17:29.180
This is a real
Portland experience!

17:29.182 --> 17:30.815
Ah, hippie hair
in my mouth!

17:30.817 --> 17:32.083
Hippie hair in my mouth!

17:32.085 --> 17:33.918
(squeaking chatter)

17:33.920 --> 17:36.487
And with that message
from Beaker,

17:36.489 --> 17:39.690
all of the Muppets
have wished Bob and Ashley

17:39.692 --> 17:41.759
a very happy wedding.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.194
(growling voice):
Except for me.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.696
(normal voice):
Cookie Monster, is that you?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.732
Now, I understand,
Cookie Monster,

17:47.734 --> 17:51.702
you've got a very special song
to sing for us.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.939
(growling voice):
Yes, I do!

17:54.941 --> 17:57.742
¶ Ah... ¶

17:57.744 --> 18:01.379
¶ Ve... ¶

18:01.381 --> 18:02.847
¶ Mari... ¶

18:02.849 --> 18:05.216
(fire alarm wailing)

18:05.218 --> 18:07.351
There are a lot of ways
to stall a wedding, okay?

18:07.353 --> 18:08.553
And you just happened to...

18:08.555 --> 18:10.388
Go talk to him.

18:10.390 --> 18:13.091
Yeah. Talk to
the guy you like.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.963
Hey, killer.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.399
Hey, so, uh...

18:21.401 --> 18:22.800
I'd love to see you again
before you leave.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.435
To be honest
with you, Cece,

18:24.437 --> 18:27.038
I've always had
a crush on you.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.974
Oh, God.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.276
Okay, so I've never said
this out loud before, but...

18:34.247 --> 18:37.248
I'm...

18:37.250 --> 18:39.217
in love with
someone else.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.586
It's kind of complicated
because he has a girlfriend,

18:41.588 --> 18:43.221
so I can't tell anybody.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.790
I mean, Winston knows, but
you, you don't know Winston.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.992
I got to get back
to the truck soon.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.393
Power steering's out again.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.229
I'm the only one
strong enough to drive it.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.630
Of course.
- But, uh,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.398
I guess I'll see you around.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.700
Yeah, I guess.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.569
(bicycle bell dings)

18:58.571 --> 19:00.905
Okay, okay.
- Got it.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.573
Oh, my God!
Thank God you guys are here!

19:02.575 --> 19:03.908
Is my mom okay?
(both panting)

19:03.910 --> 19:05.343
It's actually really hard

19:05.345 --> 19:07.311
riding one of these bikes;
it's super tiring.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.846
I don't have
a watch on.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.748
I don't know why
I'm doing that.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.784
Dad, I...

19:13.786 --> 19:16.354
(Bob humming music)

19:23.429 --> 19:25.329
(continues humming)

19:25.331 --> 19:27.665
Aren't they cute?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.267
Cute as a mute.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.636
That's a thing.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.871
People-people say that.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.506
(sighs)

19:35.508 --> 19:37.708
Love is never what you think
it's gonna be, is it?

19:37.710 --> 19:40.845
No, it isn't.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.115
Hey, Nick...

19:44.117 --> 19:46.350
you were right.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.453
He should've been here.

19:49.455 --> 19:52.290
I need a guy who shows up.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.960
'Cause anything else
just isn't real.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.198
Jess, you should,
uh, know something, too.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.332
I touched

20:01.334 --> 20:02.366
both your mother's breasts

20:02.368 --> 20:06.337
in a communal womb
earlier today.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.873
I didn't do it on purpose,
but there it is.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.508
Thanks for telling me.
I appreciate it.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.410
It's a relief
to get it off my shoulders.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.544
Thanks for being cool about it.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.745
I'll leave you alone.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.480
(continues humming)

20:16.482 --> 20:18.482
Wait, what?

20:20.486 --> 20:22.486
I didn't read
about this place.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.489
That's because it's not
in any guidebook, Tagliaboo.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.925
It is called Crush Pond.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.360
At least that's what Jess
and I used to call it.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.162
We used to come down here
when she liked somebody.

20:31.164 --> 20:32.430
We'd throw a rock
in the pond,

20:32.432 --> 20:34.098
and we'd wish that
they liked her back.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.666
Huh.
- I'd sit over there

20:35.668 --> 20:37.235
and smoke cloves
while she did that.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.175
I broke up with Ryan.

20:44.177 --> 20:45.509
Wow.
- Oh, babe, I'm sorry.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.012
How'd he take it?

20:48.014 --> 20:50.214
Actually, pretty good.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.016
So you got his voice mail.
- Yeah.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.184
Sounds about right.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.121
Last stop on the tour.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.191
Um... it's Crush Pond.

21:00.193 --> 21:03.194
So... say a name in your head

21:03.196 --> 21:06.297
and throw the rock
in the pond,

21:06.299 --> 21:09.467
and they'll love you forever.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.136
Um, and for the record,
that's actually never worked.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.071
(laughs)

21:14.073 --> 21:15.640
So we're gonna
do it anyways?

21:15.642 --> 21:17.275
JESS:
Yeah.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.577
We're really gonna do this?

21:19.579 --> 21:21.379
I got a big one.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.147
(singsongy):
I know who your rock is for.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.315
Winston, you
better shut up

21:24.317 --> 21:26.417
before I knock that fade
right off your head.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.085
(chuckles): You don't know me
like that, Cece. I swear...

21:28.087 --> 21:29.954
Oh, I know you like that,
trust me.
- Swear to God...

21:29.956 --> 21:32.290
Uh, I'm gonna say
Detroit Pistons.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.257
You're not
getting it, man.

21:33.259 --> 21:34.725
What-what is it?

21:34.727 --> 21:36.494
You got to say,
like, a lady's name.

21:36.496 --> 21:39.730
Oh.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.965
Gladys.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.633
A lady you know.
- Oh.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.170
To whoever you are,
can't wait to meet you.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.506
And I hope you live close by.

21:48.508 --> 21:51.575
Three, two, one.
(all cheer)
