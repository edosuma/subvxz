WEBVTT

00:10.825 --> 00:11.957
He's agitated.

00:12.059 --> 00:14.727
He's not happy that I'm here.

00:14.829 --> 00:17.429
It gives me crazy vibes
up and down my spine.

00:17.515 --> 00:19.832
He's making the living sick.

00:19.934 --> 00:21.700
To think that whatever's here
is actually picking on you

00:21.786 --> 00:22.968
pisses me off.

00:23.971 --> 00:25.170
I have horrible nightmares.

00:25.272 --> 00:26.972
He is...

00:27.074 --> 00:28.907
an evil lunatic.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.049
This is bad, bad stuff all around.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.425
There's a dark presence.

00:35.525 --> 00:37.559
My name is Amy Allan.

00:37.661 --> 00:39.561
These things, they're freaking out.

00:39.663 --> 00:40.962
They're from hell.

00:41.064 --> 00:42.063
I see dead people.

00:42.165 --> 00:43.331
They were being hunted.

00:43.433 --> 00:45.100
I speak to dead people.

00:45.202 --> 00:47.001
They were setting people on fire,

00:47.104 --> 00:48.136
burning them alive.

00:48.238 --> 00:49.637
And they speak to me.

00:49.740 --> 00:50.939
Her neck got broken.

00:51.041 --> 00:53.908
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.777
I hear a gunshot.

00:55.879 --> 00:57.345
I rely on my partner.

00:57.447 --> 00:58.980
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:59.082 --> 01:00.815
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:00.917 --> 01:02.016
Something's not right here.

01:02.119 --> 01:05.352
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:05.455 --> 01:06.393
It's not safe here.

01:06.493 --> 01:08.209
It's my job to reveal them.

01:08.328 --> 01:09.561
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:09.663 --> 01:10.629
They're all buried here.

01:10.731 --> 01:12.297
But Steve and I never speak...

01:12.399 --> 01:14.389
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.489 --> 01:15.789
Until the very end...

01:15.891 --> 01:17.090
I can't do it no more.

01:17.192 --> 01:19.125
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:19.227 --> 01:20.994
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

01:21.096 --> 01:22.295
Or time to get out.

01:22.397 --> 01:23.763
It does not have a happy ending.

01:23.865 --> 01:26.032
Something kills people here.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.648
I'm in Wausau, Wisconsin,

01:41.748 --> 01:43.165
about an hour and a half from Green Bay.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.572
I didn't think long
about taking on this case.

01:46.657 --> 01:48.240
I received a call from a mother of four

01:48.375 --> 01:50.092
who just moved into a new townhouse

01:50.210 --> 01:52.261
and says the entire
family's under attack.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.379
Now, to make things worse,

01:54.465 --> 01:56.582
she has a degenerative eye disease

01:56.667 --> 01:58.550
and now is legally blind.

01:58.652 --> 01:59.735
Her story really touched my heart,

01:59.853 --> 02:01.320
and I hope we can bring
this woman some peace.

02:07.970 --> 02:08.969
Before Amy arrives...

02:10.306 --> 02:11.772
I clear the area of
any leading information...

02:13.676 --> 02:16.477
covering personal items

02:16.562 --> 02:19.997
and removing family photos
that may influence her findings.

02:21.717 --> 02:23.350
When I'm done,

02:23.452 --> 02:25.769
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:39.702 --> 02:43.287
There's a lot going on around here.

02:43.405 --> 02:45.389
There's a lady...

02:45.508 --> 02:48.625
she's got a really bad vibe to her.

02:48.711 --> 02:51.712
She's claiming to be either Death

02:51.814 --> 02:53.981
or associated with Death.

02:57.186 --> 02:58.986
Ahh, this is a disaster.

03:00.923 --> 03:01.889
There's a jerk,

03:01.991 --> 03:04.425
and he's not happy that I'm here.

03:04.842 --> 03:07.109
He said something about
trying to stab me in the eye

03:07.211 --> 03:08.310
with, like, needles.

03:19.223 --> 03:20.664
So, Beth, when I
spoke to you on the phone,

03:20.764 --> 03:22.130
it was obvious that your problems here

03:22.232 --> 03:23.398
are pretty intense.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.633
Before we even get to that,

03:24.735 --> 03:26.435
I want to talk about
your medical condition.

03:26.537 --> 03:28.003
You're going blind.

03:28.088 --> 03:31.707
Yes, just been slowly going
blind since I was like five.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.909
Can you explain to me what
you're seeing right now?

03:33.994 --> 03:34.910
Do you see me?

03:34.995 --> 03:35.944
The clothes you're wearing are dark,

03:36.030 --> 03:37.896
and I can't see detail.

03:38.015 --> 03:40.115
Okay, and how much
time do you have left?

03:40.217 --> 03:42.834
- Maybe a couple months.
- Wow.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.019
I mean, it breaks my heart.

03:44.121 --> 03:45.871
It's one of the main
reasons I took this case.

03:47.208 --> 03:48.791
How long have you guys been here?

03:48.893 --> 03:51.193
We've only been here
for like four months.

03:51.278 --> 03:55.397
<i>The last two places we
were at got really intense.</i>

03:55.499 --> 03:58.782
It's happened pretty much
everywhere we've lived.

03:58.882 --> 04:00.748
- But now you bought this place?
- Yes.

04:00.850 --> 04:03.518
We can't just up and leave
like we did the last two houses.

04:03.653 --> 04:06.621
Who exactly lives here
in the house with you?

04:06.723 --> 04:10.758
It's me, my fiancÃ©,
Klay, our 4 kids...

04:10.860 --> 04:15.129
- Jeanette, she's 16, Mitchell, he's 14.
- Okay.

04:15.231 --> 04:17.932
Kayleigh's seven, and
then Klayton is six.

04:18.034 --> 04:20.968
Okay, so, why don't you take
me through what's going on?

04:21.071 --> 04:22.236
You can hear stomping,

04:22.339 --> 04:25.373
you'll hear walking
up and down the stairs,

04:25.508 --> 04:28.862
see a lot of dark shadows,
and you'll hear voices.

04:28.962 --> 04:31.430
You feel like you're being watched 24/7,

04:31.515 --> 04:32.464
everywhere you are.

04:32.549 --> 04:35.450
And it's started getting physical now.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.569
And I got to assume this
is frightening the kids.

04:37.671 --> 04:39.137
We all sleep in here.

04:39.273 --> 04:40.180
This is where we all come.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.414
We move the table, and we
make a bed on the floor.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.582
- All you guys?
- Yeah.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.551
Nobody wants to be in their room.

04:46.637 --> 04:48.920
I'm scared to death of my bedroom.

04:49.006 --> 04:50.555
When you guys are all
sleeping down here,

04:50.691 --> 04:52.057
does that make things
better for you guys?

04:52.192 --> 04:53.091
No, not really.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.927
I've started getting
a little bit drained,

04:56.063 --> 04:58.296
feeling more tired than usual.

04:58.382 --> 05:01.933
The kids complain about
stomachaches and headaches.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.536
As the activity intensifies,

05:04.621 --> 05:06.679
so does, like, the health issues.

05:06.779 --> 05:08.529
To think that whatever's here
is actually picking on you

05:08.614 --> 05:09.830
pisses me off...

05:09.949 --> 05:11.782
I mean, to the point where
I want to strangle somebody.

05:11.918 --> 05:14.518
I don't know how you're
as composed as you are.

05:14.620 --> 05:15.686
I just...

05:17.023 --> 05:18.689
learned to keep my
composure very well.

05:18.774 --> 05:20.291
I have to.

05:20.393 --> 05:21.759
I just don't really have a choice.

05:21.861 --> 05:23.661
- I have to do it for the kids.
- Right.

05:23.763 --> 05:25.996
'Cause they're my first concern.

05:28.334 --> 05:29.900
You okay?

05:30.036 --> 05:31.635
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

05:33.873 --> 05:35.839
I know.

05:35.908 --> 05:38.125
You know, you're allowed to
break down once in awhile.

05:42.615 --> 05:45.783
I just don't want my kids to
have to rely on everybody else.

05:45.885 --> 05:47.284
I should be the one

05:47.370 --> 05:48.819
that is able to take care of them

05:48.921 --> 05:49.970
and protect them and...

05:50.089 --> 05:51.772
Yeah, but you can't
do it all by yourself.

06:04.604 --> 06:06.170
"Dire."

06:06.272 --> 06:08.839
"Dire."

06:08.924 --> 06:10.074
"Dire, dire."

06:10.386 --> 06:11.685
Ah, somebody keeps yelling that.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.887
Okay, okay.

06:14.891 --> 06:16.657
Somebody here is affected

06:16.742 --> 06:19.727
by the energy here,

06:19.812 --> 06:22.014
which is making them...

06:22.114 --> 06:24.582
like, disoriented.

06:27.036 --> 06:29.270
They can't...

06:29.355 --> 06:31.822
function properly.

06:32.992 --> 06:36.527
I think that it's making
them feel sick, drained.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.263
Mm.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.266
Very... bad.

06:50.916 --> 06:51.848
You know, Beth, looking around,

06:51.951 --> 06:54.298
you guys obviously haven't
really moved in yet.

06:54.398 --> 06:57.199
We don't use this room, really.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.483
'Cause you guys are downstairs.

06:58.569 --> 06:59.451
Yeah.

06:59.536 --> 07:00.836
Okay, so, what's happening up here

07:00.921 --> 07:02.137
that's scaring you guys off?

07:02.239 --> 07:04.823
You can hear walking around up here

07:04.942 --> 07:06.691
when everyone's sleeping.

07:06.777 --> 07:08.293
Well, you got six people
living in the house.

07:08.412 --> 07:10.479
- Kids sleepwalk or anything like that?
- No.

07:10.614 --> 07:11.646
How often are you hearing that?

07:11.782 --> 07:13.181
Daily. Okay.

07:13.317 --> 07:14.316
Anything else up here?

07:14.418 --> 07:16.468
Shadows, lots of shadows.

07:16.587 --> 07:18.820
I'm not trying to be mean,
but you have this eye problem.

07:18.922 --> 07:20.639
You're seeing shadows
because of your eyes?

07:20.724 --> 07:22.657
No, I don't think so.

07:22.759 --> 07:24.092
Everyone else has seen them.

07:28.399 --> 07:30.599
Death Lady is...

07:30.701 --> 07:31.800
happy.

07:31.903 --> 07:33.686
She seems...

07:33.804 --> 07:36.488
excited and enthusiastic.

07:37.933 --> 07:40.683
She wants me to go upstairs.

07:45.190 --> 07:46.172
Mm.

07:48.260 --> 07:53.062
She tells me that she has a
lot of business in this area.

07:53.148 --> 07:55.448
I'm gonna assume that that means

07:55.567 --> 07:58.868
that a lot of people die
around here very often.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.772
Most people imagine Death
looking like the Grim Reaper,

08:02.874 --> 08:06.843
but it can project
itself any way it wants.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.145
And for some reason,
it's showing itself to me

08:09.247 --> 08:11.514
as a short woman with a wide hat.

08:13.852 --> 08:15.552
Ugh. Geez.

08:15.654 --> 08:17.554
It's hard to breathe.

08:17.656 --> 08:18.855
There's a lot of crying...

08:24.462 --> 08:25.995
hyperventilating.

08:26.097 --> 08:27.597
- The living, you're talking about?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

08:27.682 --> 08:30.350
Like, freaking out.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.684
This is bad, bad stuff all around.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.246
So, Jeanette,
I was talking to Mom.

08:43.347 --> 08:44.881
She says she relies on you a lot.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.116
I'm the oldest. I'm
like her second eyes.

08:47.252 --> 08:49.202
- How old are you?
- I'm 16.

08:49.287 --> 08:50.870
That's a lot for a
16-year-old to have to take on.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.091
Yeah.

08:52.191 --> 08:54.491
So, what kind of things
are happening to you?

08:54.593 --> 08:55.726
What's going on?

08:55.828 --> 08:58.312
I'm seeing a tall black
figure that looks like a human,

08:58.430 --> 08:59.696
but just black shadow.

08:59.798 --> 09:02.266
And would you say it
was a male or a female?

09:02.292 --> 09:02.908
Male.

09:02.968 --> 09:04.301
Anything face...

09:04.436 --> 09:05.698
could you see any face,
or it was all black?

09:05.724 --> 09:06.144
All black.

09:06.238 --> 09:07.446
You blink, and then it's gone.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.605
Okay, now, where are you seeing it?

09:09.691 --> 09:11.007
I always see it upstairs.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.742
It just happened yesterday.

09:12.877 --> 09:13.826
I was going to sleep,

09:13.912 --> 09:15.878
and I got this feeling of being watched.

09:15.964 --> 09:17.380
And I turned around,

09:17.482 --> 09:20.583
and there's that black figure
standing in front of my door.

09:20.718 --> 09:21.751
So, what happens?

09:21.836 --> 09:22.635
I screamed,

09:22.754 --> 09:24.687
and I ran straight downstairs.

09:24.822 --> 09:25.855
Okay, interesting.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.285
Do you have anything else going on?

09:27.385 --> 09:30.069
Yes, there are times when
I wake up in the morning,

09:30.188 --> 09:31.854
and I'll have these bruises.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.256
They're usually always on my legs.

09:34.358 --> 09:36.192
In fact, I woke up
with one this morning.

09:40.064 --> 09:41.197
Well, that could almost
anything, sweetie.

09:41.299 --> 09:42.598
You might have a deficiency
in a vitamin or something.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.167
- But you don't know how you've done it?
- Yeah.

09:45.269 --> 09:47.582
I don't remember hitting
myself on anything.

09:47.682 --> 09:49.148
Okay, so you're just
waking up like that.

09:49.234 --> 09:50.416
Yes.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.001
How do you even sleep at night?

09:52.120 --> 09:53.286
It's hard to sleep.

09:53.421 --> 09:56.756
And whenever I do fall asleep,
I have horrible nightmares.

10:03.164 --> 10:03.963
Mnh-mnh.

10:04.966 --> 10:08.368
Death Lady a lot in here.

10:09.471 --> 10:14.173
Well, she does come through
the door in the closet.

10:15.911 --> 10:17.810
A creepy guy comes
in here, too...

10:17.913 --> 10:20.146
the one who threatened me outside.

10:21.449 --> 10:24.083
Do you have any idea
if anybody's seen him?

10:24.185 --> 10:26.386
He's pretty [bleep] strong,

10:26.488 --> 10:29.322
so I would assume it's a possibility.

10:29.424 --> 10:31.541
There is a girl...

10:31.626 --> 10:32.859
a teenager, getting choked.

10:32.961 --> 10:35.878
I think maybe he's the
one who's choking her.

10:35.997 --> 10:38.631
And he's influencing this girl,

10:38.733 --> 10:40.833
making bad thoughts in her head

10:40.936 --> 10:44.404
to do things to herself
that are not good.

10:44.506 --> 10:45.638
Death cannot intervene.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.508
It can only watch, wait.

10:51.846 --> 10:53.546
Why is he doing this?

10:53.648 --> 10:56.649
Because he is an evil lunatic.

11:17.521 --> 11:19.942
I understand that you guys
only lived here a few months

11:20.042 --> 11:21.776
and some things have been going on.

11:23.179 --> 11:24.945
Okay. So, Kayleigh, how old are you?

11:25.014 --> 11:26.680
- Seven.
- Seven.

11:26.766 --> 11:29.083
- And, Klayton, how old are you, buddy?
- Six.

11:29.185 --> 11:30.217
Why don't you, Kayleigh,

11:30.303 --> 11:31.685
tell me one thing that's happened

11:31.771 --> 11:33.320
that you can remember?

11:33.423 --> 11:35.222
Upstairs in my bedroom,

11:35.324 --> 11:39.260
someone was looking through the window.

11:39.362 --> 11:41.162
I think it was a man.

11:41.264 --> 11:42.746
Do you know if he was a man like me?

11:42.832 --> 11:44.198
Was he an older man, white man?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.700
He was all black.

11:46.803 --> 11:47.685
How about you, buddy?

11:47.770 --> 11:49.003
Did you ever see anything like that?

11:49.088 --> 11:53.607
I know I saw that down
here in the window.

11:53.709 --> 11:54.742
Which window?

11:54.877 --> 11:55.626
In here.

11:55.745 --> 11:57.278
In the kitchen here?

11:57.380 --> 11:58.729
Can you tell me what he looked like?

11:58.815 --> 12:00.147
Black in color.

12:00.233 --> 12:02.249
Okay, did he frighten you?

12:02.385 --> 12:03.284
He did.

12:03.386 --> 12:05.586
- So, anything else happen to you?
- Mm...

12:07.089 --> 12:09.023
I remember when I was asleep,

12:09.125 --> 12:11.158
and then I was getting poked.

12:11.294 --> 12:12.793
Show me how you got poked.

12:12.895 --> 12:14.028
Let me feel it.

12:14.130 --> 12:14.962
Like that?

12:16.114 --> 12:17.447
Okay, did it wake you up?

12:18.400 --> 12:19.900
You guys like living here?

12:20.819 --> 12:22.919
- Mnh-mnh.
- Not that much.

12:23.005 --> 12:27.707
We only sleep downstairs
'cause we're scared a lot.

12:30.279 --> 12:31.344
Oh, God.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.412
You all right?

12:32.514 --> 12:34.814
I think I might have to leave soon.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.049
What's going on?

12:36.151 --> 12:37.584
The guy...

12:37.686 --> 12:39.319
What is he doing to you?

12:39.421 --> 12:42.856
He keeps, like, touching me and...

12:42.958 --> 12:44.189
making me feel sick.

12:46.137 --> 12:48.271
Is this something he
does to the living, also?

12:48.373 --> 12:51.240
I think that's possible.

12:51.343 --> 12:52.976
Yeah.

13:01.411 --> 13:03.719
I was talking to Beth
about what's going on,

13:03.819 --> 13:05.318
and I tell you, she breaks my heart.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.721
- Strong woman, though.
- Very, very.

13:07.806 --> 13:09.990
You got to be worried
about her, I would think.

13:12.394 --> 13:14.227
I worry about everyone.

13:14.363 --> 13:15.996
I mean, I look at
her, and I want to cry.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.600
Okay. You know, we
bought it, and we want...

13:21.803 --> 13:22.969
I want this to be our home.

13:23.055 --> 13:26.840
Like, this is our final
resting spot for Beth 'cause...

13:26.925 --> 13:29.843
or I say it's gonna be gone.

13:29.928 --> 13:33.413
I mean, I'm worried more
about somebody getting hurt.

13:33.498 --> 13:34.514
Right.

13:34.616 --> 13:37.400
It gives me crazy vibes
up and down my spine.

13:37.519 --> 13:39.869
What about you? Have
you experienced anything?

13:39.955 --> 13:40.904
Yeah.

13:41.023 --> 13:43.056
Sitting down, just
chilling, watching TV,

13:43.158 --> 13:45.025
and I'm just sitting in my chair,

13:45.127 --> 13:47.761
and something just came right past me.

13:47.846 --> 13:49.646
You know, it was tall...

13:49.765 --> 13:52.299
well, probably at least six foot...

13:52.401 --> 13:55.535
kind of, like,
dark-in-the-middle figure

13:55.637 --> 13:58.838
with a light glow around it.

13:58.941 --> 14:00.607
So I got up out of my chair,

14:00.709 --> 14:03.276
and I walked in the
kitchen, and nobody there.

14:03.378 --> 14:04.978
I went into the garage.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.580
And I looked, and nothing.

14:06.682 --> 14:07.914
That was whacked.

14:08.016 --> 14:10.333
It was shortly after my brother died.

14:10.419 --> 14:13.219
And my mother passed,
and then my brother died.

14:13.322 --> 14:15.689
I lost like seven,
eight, nine family members

14:15.774 --> 14:17.524
in like a matter of two years.

14:19.261 --> 14:20.794
I asked the good Lord...

14:23.632 --> 14:25.966
try to stay strong.

14:26.051 --> 14:27.384
When you saw the shadow,

14:27.469 --> 14:30.403
you thought maybe it was
somebody from the family.

14:37.913 --> 14:39.479
The energy down here

14:39.581 --> 14:42.165
is almost like you can grab it.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.250
It's so thick.

14:44.386 --> 14:48.421
The creepy guy from upstairs
likes it down here, too.

14:48.523 --> 14:50.175
And he's being bad.

14:50.275 --> 14:53.643
He's influencing living people here.

14:54.596 --> 14:55.878
He's really good

14:56.014 --> 14:59.148
at making physical connections

14:59.250 --> 15:00.316
with living people.

15:00.418 --> 15:02.516
Yeah, he's not doing good stuff.

15:02.616 --> 15:04.516
He's making the living sick.

15:04.585 --> 15:06.518
He's hurting them.

15:07.855 --> 15:09.855
Mm. Interesting.

15:09.957 --> 15:10.856
He's...

15:10.958 --> 15:13.392
He's very strong.

15:15.145 --> 15:18.346
Very, actually... very, very
[bleep] very [bleep] strong.

15:20.467 --> 15:23.969
You got a problem with people
getting physically touched here,

15:24.071 --> 15:26.605
you know, and keeping
you guys up at night.

15:26.707 --> 15:28.673
You know, it's not good.

15:28.776 --> 15:30.475
There's definitely something.

15:30.561 --> 15:32.344
I'd really like to stay.

15:32.446 --> 15:35.247
I love her to death,
and I'm here for her.

15:35.349 --> 15:38.250
I worry more about them than myself,

15:38.335 --> 15:40.635
'cause they're the ones
that are suffering more.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.588
You know, that's what I'm here for.

15:45.688 --> 15:46.854
We'll do the best we can.

15:46.990 --> 15:47.972
Appreciate it.

15:48.091 --> 15:49.790
Ah, no worries.

15:51.361 --> 15:52.827
You're so welcome.

15:53.763 --> 15:54.795
You'll be all right, trust me.

16:11.664 --> 16:14.369
I started making some calls
and found something surprising.

16:15.234 --> 16:16.275
Beth and Klay's property

16:16.375 --> 16:17.815
used to be part of a large factory.

16:17.915 --> 16:19.831
Apparently, they used to
make fly swatters there.

16:20.717 --> 16:22.167
I'm heading over to
meet with a local author

16:22.269 --> 16:23.451
who said there was nothing funny

16:23.537 --> 16:25.791
about what happened to
the owner of that business.

16:30.377 --> 16:31.743
So, Shawn, you
mentioned on the phone

16:31.845 --> 16:34.312
that factory sitting
on my client's property

16:34.414 --> 16:35.814
at one time made fly swatters.

16:35.899 --> 16:37.148
- Is that right?
- Correct.

16:37.234 --> 16:38.199
What's the story with that?

16:38.285 --> 16:40.252
Well, Arthur Hurd and George Wilson

16:40.320 --> 16:42.737
purchased your client's
property around 1908,

16:42.856 --> 16:44.856
and by 1910, they had
a factory built there.

16:44.958 --> 16:47.709
I have a map here that kind
of shows where the factory was.

16:47.794 --> 16:52.030
<i>It sat right where your
client's house is right now.</i>

16:52.115 --> 16:55.884
This is actually what
the factory looked like.

16:56.003 --> 16:57.420
You said things went bad for these guys.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.653
What happened?

16:58.755 --> 17:01.956
By 1911, Wilson left the company

17:02.058 --> 17:05.041
and left Mr. Hurd by himself
to try to run the place.

17:05.127 --> 17:07.328
All right, so, how's it
go for Hurd at this point?

17:07.430 --> 17:08.796
Well, it was a struggle for him.

17:08.897 --> 17:11.132
He didn't have the expertise
that his partner had,

17:11.267 --> 17:13.034
but he continued to work forward,

17:13.136 --> 17:15.202
and he put his heart
and soul into running it.

17:15.304 --> 17:17.838
And I think it became
pretty stressful on him,

17:17.940 --> 17:20.207
and February 3rd of 1925,

17:20.343 --> 17:21.409
he actually suffered a heart attack

17:21.511 --> 17:22.443
at the site.

17:22.545 --> 17:23.481
In the factory?

17:23.580 --> 17:24.497
Correct.

17:24.582 --> 17:26.165
Here's actually his death certificate.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.787
And he was pretty influential
in the town because,

17:31.889 --> 17:33.139
right on the front page,

17:33.257 --> 17:34.890
they put in his obituary that day.

17:37.495 --> 17:40.196
I saw a very different
structure than this one.

17:40.298 --> 17:44.383
The structure seemed large.

17:44.469 --> 17:48.337
I think it had bricks.

17:50.575 --> 17:52.408
There's a guy...

17:52.510 --> 17:54.510
he's agitated.

17:56.481 --> 17:58.380
He's very high-strung,

17:58.483 --> 18:00.883
and this is his territory,

18:00.985 --> 18:04.153
and he had to, I guess,
fight really hard for it.

18:04.255 --> 18:08.123
This guy is not dealing
with his death very well.

18:09.710 --> 18:11.060
I'm gonna say he died from, like,

18:11.162 --> 18:12.962
a stroke or a heart attack.

18:15.733 --> 18:17.133
After finding out that a factory

18:17.235 --> 18:19.135
used to sit right on
my client's property

18:19.220 --> 18:22.105
and that the owner basically
worked himself to death,

18:22.190 --> 18:23.139
I hit the local library

18:23.241 --> 18:24.373
to see if there was anything else

18:24.459 --> 18:25.708
that could help my investigation.

18:27.679 --> 18:30.379
Turns out, a massive
insane asylum and poor farm

18:30.482 --> 18:32.014
operated for nearly 80 years

18:32.100 --> 18:34.584
right next to Beth
and Klayton's property.

18:36.087 --> 18:37.953
You know, from doing
these investigations,

18:38.053 --> 18:40.103
I know a lot of these poor
farms and mental asylums

18:40.189 --> 18:41.555
mistreated their patients.

18:41.657 --> 18:44.308
So I reached out to a
local newspaper reporter.

18:44.426 --> 18:47.411
He said this place was filled
with neglect, abuse, and death.

18:54.603 --> 18:57.371
So, Keith, the asylum seemed
like it was really close

18:57.506 --> 18:58.672
to my client's original property line.

18:58.757 --> 19:00.307
- Is that right?
- That's right.

19:00.409 --> 19:02.593
And as a matter of fact, you can see it.

19:02.678 --> 19:04.845
It's right over there across the river.

19:04.947 --> 19:06.930
Were you able to find out
when this place was built?

19:07.016 --> 19:09.066
Yeah, it was built in 1893.

19:10.336 --> 19:12.870
It was in operation for about 78 years.

19:12.988 --> 19:14.288
How many people did this house?

19:14.390 --> 19:16.623
It was big. It would've
housed up to about 300 people.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.893
What kind of people would
actually be treated at this place?

19:19.995 --> 19:21.762
There'd been schizophrenics.

19:21.847 --> 19:24.014
There would've been manic-depressives.

19:24.099 --> 19:25.799
There would've been the elderly.

19:25.901 --> 19:27.818
Now, you mentioned on the phone
how bad the conditions were.

19:27.937 --> 19:28.869
What are we talking about?

19:28.971 --> 19:30.671
In the 1950s, the superintendents

19:30.773 --> 19:33.841
came under investigation
by the Marathon County D.A.

19:33.943 --> 19:37.084
for overcrowded conditions,
limited staffing.

19:37.184 --> 19:39.784
There were hundreds of people there.

19:39.870 --> 19:42.838
They only had four bathtubs.

19:42.906 --> 19:44.272
So, when I first contacted you,

19:44.374 --> 19:46.575
I asked you to find out if
there was any unusual deaths

19:46.677 --> 19:47.626
that might help my case.

19:47.744 --> 19:49.161
Were you able to come up with anything?

19:49.279 --> 19:51.229
Yeah, I found five interesting deaths.

19:51.348 --> 19:53.548
The first one was in 1895,

19:53.634 --> 19:56.017
when an inmate hung himself.

19:58.105 --> 20:00.856
In 1899, three men were asphyxiated

20:00.941 --> 20:02.824
while working in a silo on the farm.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.962
In 1903, a 37-year-old inmate

20:07.064 --> 20:09.347
was stabbed to death by
an 85-year-old inmate.

20:09.466 --> 20:10.532
What was it over?

20:10.634 --> 20:12.717
I guess it was over living quarters.

20:12.803 --> 20:13.919
Couple more.

20:14.004 --> 20:17.339
In 1920, a man named
John Kyough told nurses

20:17.424 --> 20:19.908
that he was gonna go
fishing down on the river.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.443
He had a wooden leg.

20:21.528 --> 20:24.679
He removed it, tied
an anchor to his waist,

20:24.765 --> 20:26.298
threw himself in the river.

20:28.324 --> 20:30.173
You said there was
five. What was the fifth?

20:30.276 --> 20:32.826
Yeah, there was one more inmate suicide.

20:32.945 --> 20:34.728
This one happened in 1933.

20:34.847 --> 20:37.948
He laid down on a stick of dynamite

20:38.033 --> 20:39.783
and blew himself up.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.085
That's a lot of death.

20:42.187 --> 20:44.037
These are the ones we know about.

20:44.123 --> 20:47.024
There certainly would've had
to been a lot more deaths.

20:47.126 --> 20:50.577
Nurses reported that they didn't
even bother keeping records,

20:50.663 --> 20:52.579
'cause once people were brought in,

20:52.665 --> 20:55.766
they just expected them to be
there forever till they died.

20:56.969 --> 20:58.001
Okay.

20:59.205 --> 21:01.472
I hear a male, and he said,

21:01.574 --> 21:04.410
"We are lost and need help out of here."

21:05.700 --> 21:06.344
And he said,

21:06.444 --> 21:09.679
"We can't see to find our way out."

21:09.814 --> 21:12.481
There's about 11 of them.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.151
They can't even see each other.

21:15.253 --> 21:17.253
I asked how did he die?

21:17.355 --> 21:19.455
He said, "A death camp."

21:46.845 --> 21:49.357
One other thing got my
attention during my research.

21:49.457 --> 21:52.444
There was a brutal murder about
1,200 feet from Beth's house.

21:52.544 --> 21:55.045
The victim was a young woman
heading home from church.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.680
Now, look, it may be a long shot,

21:56.765 --> 21:58.899
but I'm heading over to
meet with a Wausau detective

21:59.018 --> 22:00.951
who said it was one of
the most notorious crimes

22:01.036 --> 22:01.952
in the city's history.

22:09.177 --> 22:10.776
So, Greg, I came across this homicide

22:10.878 --> 22:12.978
that happened pretty close
to my client's property.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.313
What do you know about it?

22:14.415 --> 22:18.083
Murder happened on April 18, 1966.

22:18.169 --> 22:21.437
This is our victim...
Mary Holzem, 26 years old.

22:21.522 --> 22:22.438
This is the guy
that killed her...

22:22.523 --> 22:25.191
Eugene Schopf, 29 years old.

22:25.293 --> 22:26.609
All right, so, how's
the homicide go down?

22:26.694 --> 22:28.928
Mary, she was walking home from church.

22:29.030 --> 22:31.697
Eugene Schopf here, he
picks her up in a vehicle.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.999
They go down to a bar, and
they have a couple of drinks,

22:34.101 --> 22:35.668
and then they leave
together in a vehicle.

22:35.770 --> 22:37.536
And that's the last anybody sees of her.

22:37.638 --> 22:39.805
So, what happens after that?

22:39.907 --> 22:43.843
He was somewhat infatuated
with her and came on to her.

22:43.978 --> 22:46.445
She resisted, and he
stabbed her three times.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.813
She screamed...

22:47.899 --> 22:49.148
and then he cut her throat.

22:49.283 --> 22:50.783
Oof.

22:50.885 --> 22:52.774
This is a copy of Mary
Holzem's death certificate.

22:54.174 --> 22:56.241
"Male subject apparently seduced victim

22:56.343 --> 22:58.176
to a secluded spot for his act."

22:59.437 --> 23:01.771
So, Greg, the actual
location of the homicide,

23:01.873 --> 23:04.040
how far is that from
my client's location?

23:04.142 --> 23:05.708
That was about a quarter of a mile.

23:05.793 --> 23:08.711
<i>Okay, so, now, from the article,
I understand he was caught.</i>

23:08.796 --> 23:10.388
How'd they wind up getting him?

23:10.415 --> 23:14.083
Police received a call
at about 10:45 that night

23:14.169 --> 23:17.053
that there was screaming
coming from an area

23:17.155 --> 23:18.755
just two blocks down from that bar.

23:18.857 --> 23:20.723
Police officers go over to the bar,

23:20.809 --> 23:21.808
talk to the bartender.

23:21.927 --> 23:24.928
Bartender tells them,
"Yep, Mary was in here,

23:25.030 --> 23:27.480
and she was with a guy by
the name of Gene Schopf.

23:27.566 --> 23:28.765
So they knew the guy.

23:28.850 --> 23:30.300
They knew the guy.

23:30.402 --> 23:31.868
They go down to his house.

23:31.970 --> 23:33.052
They look at the vehicle,

23:33.171 --> 23:34.304
they find blood in the trunk,

23:34.389 --> 23:35.972
they find bloody
clothes in the back seat.

23:36.057 --> 23:38.039
Gene confesses to killing her.

23:38.235 --> 23:41.169
That's his booking photo from the 19th,

23:41.271 --> 23:43.538
- the day after she was killed.
- Okay.

23:43.640 --> 23:44.906
He was charged with
first-degree murder.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.574
Wow.

23:55.152 --> 23:56.851
Ah, there's a man and a woman,

23:56.920 --> 23:59.054
and the man is the creepy guy.

23:59.139 --> 24:02.223
They're both dead, and...

24:02.359 --> 24:04.960
It's bad. It's so bad. It's so bad.

24:05.062 --> 24:08.263
They knew each other
when they were alive.

24:08.365 --> 24:10.665
And she's always...

24:10.751 --> 24:13.902
trying to get away from him...

24:14.004 --> 24:15.437
still.

24:17.441 --> 24:20.375
Mm. Mnh-mnh.

24:20.477 --> 24:22.744
Her heart's racing,

24:22.846 --> 24:26.514
'cause she's got to get away.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.516
And she's...

24:28.618 --> 24:31.019
very stressed-out.

24:31.104 --> 24:34.689
I think that the woman died here.

24:39.363 --> 24:40.796
I saw knives...

24:41.749 --> 24:44.500
somebody messing with knives.

24:48.005 --> 24:49.371
Okay, so, what happens at the trial?

24:49.473 --> 24:52.147
He goes to court and pleads "not
guilty by reason of insanity."

24:52.247 --> 24:53.646
It's a pretty brutal crime.

24:53.748 --> 24:56.015
Is there any indication
he's done this before?

24:56.100 --> 24:58.651
It came out that, in 1954,

24:58.753 --> 25:01.854
he had asked military doctors for help

25:01.940 --> 25:03.489
because he had thoughts

25:03.591 --> 25:06.425
of slicing the throats of animals

25:06.561 --> 25:08.327
and he thought he might hurt a woman.

25:08.413 --> 25:10.163
- He asked for help.
- He did.

25:10.298 --> 25:12.331
Obviously, he didn't get it,

25:12.467 --> 25:15.168
'cause this guy's got the
markings of a serial killer...

25:15.253 --> 25:16.469
especially with the animals.

25:16.554 --> 25:17.587
Yeah.

25:17.672 --> 25:19.639
In July of 1966,

25:19.724 --> 25:22.058
<i>he was found "not guilty
by reason of insanity."</i>

25:22.177 --> 25:25.111
He was committed to a
state mental institution

25:25.213 --> 25:26.546
in Waupun, Wisconsin.

25:26.648 --> 25:28.915
In the early '70s, he was released.

25:29.017 --> 25:30.349
That son of a [bleep]

25:30.451 --> 25:32.652
Can't believe they let this guy out.

25:32.754 --> 25:34.320
What happened after he was released?

25:34.422 --> 25:37.707
Last information we have
is he moves to Alabama

25:37.825 --> 25:41.627
and dies in 2002 at age 65.

25:44.399 --> 25:46.132
This creepy guy,

25:46.234 --> 25:49.635
he didn't die a long time ago.

25:52.473 --> 25:53.673
I don't think he's that old,

25:53.775 --> 25:56.976
maybe in his early 50s,

25:57.078 --> 26:00.846
and he does not like animals.

26:00.932 --> 26:04.116
And children are pests.

26:04.202 --> 26:07.720
Woman are pests... bad,
evil, evil creatures.

26:07.822 --> 26:09.522
They're evil creatures.

26:09.624 --> 26:12.508
He is very mentally ill.

26:12.594 --> 26:13.392
Mm.

26:15.830 --> 26:17.997
I see 5 and a 4, 54,

26:18.082 --> 26:19.832
so...

26:19.968 --> 26:21.250
something like that.

26:21.369 --> 26:23.469
He is evil,

26:23.605 --> 26:25.521
and he wants

26:25.640 --> 26:29.208
nothing good for anybody.

26:35.316 --> 26:37.550
I saw several dead
people during my walk,

26:37.652 --> 26:39.885
but two stood out the most...

26:39.988 --> 26:42.338
first, the creepy man
choking a living teenager

26:42.457 --> 26:43.389
in the house.

26:43.491 --> 26:47.026
He has, like, a huge rope...

26:48.129 --> 26:52.465
and he's strangling the kid with it.

26:52.567 --> 26:56.135
Over on the side, in
front of this big closet,

26:56.237 --> 27:01.057
is this woman who is really Death,

27:01.142 --> 27:05.111
and she's watching this
situation happening.

27:05.196 --> 27:08.581
Next, I describe how
Death showed herself to me.

27:08.683 --> 27:11.851
She had a... hat on,

27:11.953 --> 27:13.419
and it was black.

27:13.504 --> 27:16.906
She had very large eyes,

27:16.991 --> 27:20.893
and she was wearing,
like, a fur-collar thing,

27:20.979 --> 27:22.094
and it was black.

27:27.435 --> 27:28.901
Is this who you saw?

27:29.971 --> 27:31.103
Yes, that's who I saw.

27:50.813 --> 27:53.586
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:53.686 --> 27:55.752
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:55.855 --> 27:57.855
and our clients for the first time.

27:57.957 --> 28:00.924
So, Amy, when I decided that
we should take on this case,

28:01.010 --> 28:02.226
I knew it was gonna be emotional,

28:02.311 --> 28:04.194
but I didn't realize how emotional.

28:04.296 --> 28:05.429
This is Beth.

28:06.265 --> 28:08.832
She's one of the strongest
women I've ever met.

28:08.934 --> 28:12.402
And this is her very
supportive fiancÃ©, Klay.

28:12.505 --> 28:15.639
Now, on top of dealing with a
really bad paranormal problem

28:15.741 --> 28:16.874
that they have here,

28:16.959 --> 28:18.692
Beth has a disease that's
gonna leave her blind

28:18.777 --> 28:21.128
within the next three to four months.

28:22.665 --> 28:23.630
She called us in

28:23.749 --> 28:25.532
because she's desperate to make sure

28:25.618 --> 28:28.685
that their four kids are okay

28:28.771 --> 28:31.355
before she goes completely blind.

28:33.592 --> 28:35.325
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about your background,

28:35.461 --> 28:39.963
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

28:40.049 --> 28:42.165
Honestly, I was not looking forward

28:42.301 --> 28:44.051
to walking through the door,

28:44.169 --> 28:47.254
but I did, and as
soon as I came in here,

28:47.373 --> 28:50.173
I was hearing somebody yelling,

28:50.259 --> 28:53.377
"Dire, dire, dire!"

28:53.462 --> 28:55.746
Somebody here

28:55.831 --> 29:00.267
is affected by the energy here,

29:00.352 --> 29:01.818
which is making them...

29:01.904 --> 29:04.388
like, disoriented.

29:07.109 --> 29:08.108
Then...

29:08.193 --> 29:10.260
I went upstairs,

29:10.346 --> 29:12.796
and I was so sick up there.

29:12.898 --> 29:16.767
I felt so drained and horrible.

29:18.304 --> 29:20.270
I get a lot of headaches.

29:20.372 --> 29:21.305
I'm just tired.

29:21.407 --> 29:23.240
I don't want to do anything.

29:23.342 --> 29:26.510
I just have, like, absolutely no

29:26.612 --> 29:28.178
"get up and go."

29:28.280 --> 29:29.947
Klay, don't the kids
have stomachaches a lot?

29:30.082 --> 29:32.849
Oh, yeah, they get stomach, headache,

29:32.985 --> 29:35.485
and you can tell they're not themselves.

29:35.621 --> 29:37.537
Now, one thing you
should know about Beth

29:37.656 --> 29:40.424
is that she felt this
way in her last place.

29:40.509 --> 29:42.492
Yeah, the last place...

29:42.578 --> 29:43.994
actually, the last two places.

29:44.079 --> 29:46.863
It started out little things,

29:46.949 --> 29:49.316
and then it just intensifies

29:49.435 --> 29:52.102
to the point where it gets...

29:52.187 --> 29:53.620
like, physical.

30:08.454 --> 30:11.155
I just wish there was
something I could do to stop it.

30:15.828 --> 30:16.794
You okay, honey?

30:34.580 --> 30:35.658
- Sorry.
- No.

30:35.758 --> 30:37.873
I don't give a [bleep]
about the cameras, okay?

30:37.973 --> 30:40.224
If you need to take
a break, you tell me.

30:40.309 --> 30:43.609
I just have a hard time
talking about those places.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.725
It's okay. That's why we're here.

30:45.827 --> 30:48.128
In those houses, there
was lots of shadows,

30:48.263 --> 30:50.647
and I would see them
reach out for the kids.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.433
I just feel like I'm
going nuts or something.

30:53.535 --> 30:55.952
It's crazy.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.904
And had that kind of stuff

30:58.006 --> 31:00.006
happened throughout your life?

31:00.108 --> 31:01.174
Yeah.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.276
I've had issues as
long as I can remember.

31:07.449 --> 31:11.918
There are two main entities

31:12.020 --> 31:14.721
that are in this house,

31:14.806 --> 31:15.755
and they're the ones

31:15.891 --> 31:18.758
that I'm most concerned about.

31:18.894 --> 31:21.061
The first was the female.

31:21.146 --> 31:24.297
She explained to me that she is Death.

31:27.769 --> 31:28.768
The other interesting thing

31:28.904 --> 31:31.171
is that she interacts
directly with the living.

31:32.441 --> 31:35.275
She was very excited
for me to go upstairs

31:35.377 --> 31:36.530
and see what was going on up there.

31:36.630 --> 31:39.530
She was actually waiting
at the top of the staircase,

31:39.616 --> 31:40.815
like, smiling.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.901
And I think she causes

31:43.987 --> 31:46.237
a lot of the living stress.

31:47.307 --> 31:50.458
People may see her as a silhouette.

31:50.544 --> 31:52.677
She wears a hat,

31:52.779 --> 31:54.613
and people may see that.

31:54.698 --> 31:55.714
But she did say,

31:55.816 --> 31:57.566
<i>"I can project myself</i>

31:57.651 --> 31:59.885
any which way I want."

32:01.088 --> 32:02.921
We see shadows, and, like,

32:03.056 --> 32:05.924
I've referred to them
as silhouettes before.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.709
You saw a shadow in the kitchen, right?

32:07.828 --> 32:11.396
Oh, yeah. Right here, as we sit.

32:11.498 --> 32:13.632
It just gave me the heebie-jeebies.

32:13.717 --> 32:15.867
I'm like, "Wow, that was whacked."

32:17.437 --> 32:18.503
You know, Klay, I
hate to bring it up...

32:18.589 --> 32:19.871
I know you're in a
bad spot right now...

32:19.957 --> 32:21.573
but when you mentioned Death,

32:21.675 --> 32:24.142
you lost how many people
in the last year or so?

32:27.080 --> 32:28.663
Brother.

32:28.782 --> 32:30.999
Mother.

32:31.084 --> 32:32.117
Aunt.

32:32.252 --> 32:33.618
Uncle.

32:33.720 --> 32:34.419
Cousin.

32:35.422 --> 32:36.171
Sorry.

32:36.256 --> 32:37.222
No, don't be.

32:38.225 --> 32:39.224
He's had a lot of loss

32:39.309 --> 32:40.508
in a very short time.

32:42.996 --> 32:44.652
Now, do you have any idea
what the woman looked like?

32:44.752 --> 32:46.652
I had a sketch of her done.

32:54.495 --> 32:55.962
Here, take a look at this.

33:01.035 --> 33:03.286
Not what I'd expect her to look like,

33:03.371 --> 33:04.704
but her eyes look like Death.

33:04.789 --> 33:05.771
I don't like her eyes.

33:12.330 --> 33:14.413
Yeah, I do. I didn't
want to bring it up.

33:14.515 --> 33:16.015
When I first saw the sketch,

33:16.117 --> 33:17.883
it did remind me of
his mom a little bit.

33:17.969 --> 33:18.968
Wow.

33:22.407 --> 33:25.541
This is a picture of his mom.

33:29.030 --> 33:32.164
Wow. Ohh.

33:45.146 --> 33:48.447
I do not think that it was
done in a malicious manner.

33:48.549 --> 33:53.052
I think that this is Death
acknowledging what's happened

33:53.154 --> 33:57.957
by taking on a familiar... guise.

33:58.042 --> 34:00.259
So you didn't run into his mom.

34:00.395 --> 34:01.427
No.

34:01.512 --> 34:04.897
So this is Death projecting
itself as Klay's mom.

34:05.033 --> 34:07.967
Yeah.

34:13.908 --> 34:18.043
I then encountered a male,

34:18.146 --> 34:22.681
and this guy is no good.

34:25.553 --> 34:29.554
He was a very bad
person when he was alive.

34:29.657 --> 34:32.507
He's still a very bad person.

34:32.627 --> 34:34.110
My opinion of this guy

34:34.228 --> 34:35.628
is that he's an evil lunatic.

34:39.067 --> 34:43.034
I ran into him initially in the kitchen.

34:43.138 --> 34:44.603
He was chasing a female.

34:44.706 --> 34:48.458
This carried over from
when they were alive.

34:48.576 --> 34:52.445
She experienced her death
in the heart or chest area.

34:52.547 --> 34:56.032
I was shown knives.

34:56.150 --> 34:58.534
He was very mentally
ill when he was alive.

34:58.653 --> 35:00.620
He's still extremely mentally ill.

35:00.705 --> 35:03.156
The only clear thing that I got from him

35:03.291 --> 35:05.575
<i>was that he hates animals</i>

35:05.660 --> 35:08.728
and that women are evil creatures.

35:10.265 --> 35:12.865
And then I did get two
numbers... five and four.

35:12.951 --> 35:14.567
They were extremely
important...

35:14.702 --> 35:16.402
possibly 54.

35:16.538 --> 35:19.238
Now, a lot of things you just said

35:19.340 --> 35:21.040
make me think of a
murder that took place

35:21.126 --> 35:23.759
nearly 50 years ago, right
here in the neighborhood.

35:23.845 --> 35:25.661
On April 18, 1966,

35:25.747 --> 35:27.547
there was a girl
walking home from church.

35:28.416 --> 35:31.884
Her name was Mary Holzem.
She was 26 years old.

35:31.970 --> 35:34.020
Now, it's raining.

35:34.105 --> 35:36.852
This guy Eugene Schopf
pulls up and says,

35:36.952 --> 35:37.867
"Let me give you a ride."

35:37.953 --> 35:41.554
I have his booking photo right here.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.939
He made an advance on her.

35:43.041 --> 35:43.773
She rejects it.

35:43.859 --> 35:45.108
He flips out,

35:45.243 --> 35:47.260
stabs her several times in
the chest and the stomach,

35:47.379 --> 35:50.246
slits her throat from ear to ear...

35:51.249 --> 35:52.448
and then winds up taking her body,

35:52.551 --> 35:53.833
sticking it in the trunk,

35:53.919 --> 35:56.419
and driving her to a remote
area about seven miles from here.

35:56.505 --> 35:58.655
I got the death certificate here.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.958
This will give you an
idea of the damages on her.

36:03.595 --> 36:07.163
You mention you picked up
on a 5 and 4, or maybe a 54,

36:07.265 --> 36:08.932
which kind of blew me away a little bit.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.483
In 1954, when he was in the army,

36:10.602 --> 36:12.334
he asked for psychiatric help.

36:12.434 --> 36:14.818
He told them that he had
slashed the throats of animals

36:14.937 --> 36:17.003
and that he thought

36:17.089 --> 36:20.123
he wanted to do that to a woman one day.

36:20.209 --> 36:21.608
Instead of serving prison time,

36:21.693 --> 36:23.894
this sick bastard wound up
going to a mental hospital

36:23.979 --> 36:24.811
for 10 years.

36:24.947 --> 36:26.363
He gets released.

36:26.482 --> 36:31.051
2002, he dies in
Alabama at the age of 65.

36:31.153 --> 36:32.252
Is it possible this is your guy?

36:33.972 --> 36:37.391
I mean, a lot of things
match, for sure, for sure.

36:37.476 --> 36:40.894
Is it possible that he's
following Beth by any chance,

36:40.979 --> 36:42.729
since she's having these
problems wherever she goes?

36:42.815 --> 36:47.150
<i>I mean, it could be that
he's, you know, attracted here</i>

36:47.236 --> 36:49.386
because you have abilities.

36:53.008 --> 36:55.868
If he was alive today, I'd kick
him right in his friggin' [bleep]

36:57.906 --> 37:00.009
How is this [bleep] affecting
everybody in the house?

37:00.109 --> 37:03.327
I do think that he can
physically attack the living.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.229
I think that people could see him.

37:05.364 --> 37:06.730
He's just pure evil,

37:06.816 --> 37:09.200
and he just wants to torment people.

37:09.285 --> 37:10.901
My oldest daughter, Jeanette,

37:11.003 --> 37:13.487
she'll wake up with brand-new bruises.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.406
She woke up one morning with...

37:15.508 --> 37:18.809
it looked almost like a burn

37:18.895 --> 37:21.345
above her eye.

37:21.430 --> 37:23.747
So, I had a sketch done

37:23.883 --> 37:25.082
of what I saw

37:25.218 --> 37:27.201
a living female experiencing.

37:40.182 --> 37:41.665
What a piece of [bleep]

37:47.006 --> 37:48.789
Mother Mary of God.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.842
Here, baby, I can brighten it up.

37:53.296 --> 37:54.545
That's crazy.

38:04.373 --> 38:05.489
Well, it ain't funny.

38:36.304 --> 38:37.721
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

38:37.821 --> 38:39.921
Mnh-mnh.

38:43.861 --> 38:46.154
Amy, what do you think
may be going on here?

38:47.392 --> 38:49.909
What I understand is going on

38:49.994 --> 38:54.046
is that this crazy, evil man

38:54.165 --> 38:56.549
is focused on your daughter.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.838
<i>He is trying to influence her, as well,</i>

39:01.923 --> 39:03.005
her thoughts,

39:03.141 --> 39:04.957
and influencing her

39:05.043 --> 39:07.810
to do possibly bad things to herself.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.947
I'm concerned because...

39:11.032 --> 39:13.182
<i>Death is there</i>

39:13.284 --> 39:17.386
and is watching and waiting.

39:18.740 --> 39:21.324
<i>I mean, I think that his intentions</i>

39:21.409 --> 39:24.544
are the same intentions
he had when he was alive.

39:24.662 --> 39:26.062
Do bodily harm.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.196
Yes.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.865
He likes to torture, you know?

39:32.369 --> 39:35.370
And obviously, he likes to kill people.

39:38.992 --> 39:41.009
Well, Beth, Klay, at least now we know

39:41.094 --> 39:43.495
what's causing all the
problems in your family.

39:43.580 --> 39:46.514
And I know you two guys are fighters,

39:46.616 --> 39:49.212
but we need to find out

39:49.312 --> 39:50.611
how to kick this
[bleep] out of the house

39:50.697 --> 39:53.347
so you can live here
with your kids peacefully,

39:53.416 --> 39:54.498
the way you guys deserve.

39:56.319 --> 39:57.174
I'll turn it over to Amy,

39:57.274 --> 39:59.241
and she'll have an idea of
what we can do about this.

40:00.361 --> 40:01.410
What I would like

40:01.529 --> 40:08.467
is to get a really big,
bad, scary male medium

40:08.552 --> 40:10.052
to come in

40:10.171 --> 40:14.256
and basically kick his ass out

40:14.375 --> 40:16.475
and to then set up

40:16.610 --> 40:20.829
a very firm barrier around your property

40:20.948 --> 40:23.081
to keep the dead out of here.

40:23.167 --> 40:25.584
Let's just block those suckers out.

40:25.686 --> 40:28.070
So, I think I already know
the answer to this question,

40:28.155 --> 40:31.323
but why such a big, burly, tough medium?

40:31.425 --> 40:35.093
This crazy lunatic tries
to prey on the weak,

40:35.229 --> 40:37.896
and he is an abuser,

40:37.982 --> 40:41.944
and I think that he's
quite afraid of men.

40:43.089 --> 40:45.317
It'll be very intimidating
and frightening for him.

40:45.417 --> 40:46.315
Good.

40:46.451 --> 40:47.734
So, now, what happens with Death?

40:47.819 --> 40:49.685
My perception is that,

40:49.771 --> 40:52.405
once that guy's out of here...

40:54.075 --> 40:55.925
Death probably won't
be hanging around anymore.

40:57.729 --> 40:59.862
That's the first time
I've seen you two smile

40:59.964 --> 41:01.330
the entire night.

41:01.433 --> 41:02.582
Hmm.

41:02.700 --> 41:03.866
I mean, this is good news, I think.

41:04.002 --> 41:06.002
I'm hoping.

41:06.087 --> 41:07.103
How you feeling, Beth?

41:07.205 --> 41:09.288
Still a little in shock,

41:09.374 --> 41:11.374
but what Amy found...

41:11.476 --> 41:12.842
hopeful that,

41:12.944 --> 41:16.412
by doing what she's suggesting,

41:16.514 --> 41:17.513
that things will get better.

41:18.817 --> 41:21.684
You guys got a lot of
love going on here...

41:21.786 --> 41:22.885
so that helps.

41:24.155 --> 41:25.354
Thank you guys very much.

41:25.379 --> 41:27.379
So much.
