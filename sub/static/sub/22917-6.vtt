24:25.631 --> 24:27.550
Anyways. Here it is.

24:27.592 --> 24:29.385
WAM!

25:11.219 --> 25:12.803
Oh, shit.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.597
It's actually not bad.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.018
I bet I could outdrink it.

25:28.527 --> 25:32.031
-This is fucking creepy.
-I know.

25:32.073 --> 25:33.824
GLORIA: Yeah.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.117
Oh, Jesus.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.536
-I think he heard me.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.165
So there's really nothing

25:41.207 --> 25:43.626
between you
and that awful violinist?

25:43.668 --> 25:44.961
Oh, Christ, no.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.591
FUKUMOTO:
Maestro.

25:50.633 --> 25:53.261
There will always be a place for
human conductors and composers.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.012
Even when with a hundred WAMs
in a hundred symphonies

25:55.054 --> 25:56.180
across the world.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.016
I'm curious to see how...

25:59.058 --> 26:01.852
how a robot audience will react.

26:34.135 --> 26:37.263
WAM:
Maestro, you're up next.

26:37.305 --> 26:38.931
Are you running
through the score?

26:38.973 --> 26:40.141
Any questions?

26:40.182 --> 26:42.351
RODRIGO:
No, man.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.979
No, I'm just waiting for Mozart
to come and talk to me.

26:45.021 --> 26:47.732
Good job up there, man.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.150
-Hmm.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.568
I was flawless.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.445
Yes, you were flawless.
Yeah. You were, perhaps,

26:52.486 --> 26:54.363
a little bit too perfect,
you know?

26:54.405 --> 26:56.782
And do-do you know
what made the music beautiful?

26:56.824 --> 26:58.451
The orchestra.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.411
They w... I mean, they were
covering up for you.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.288
They were making you look good.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.873
Why would they do that?

27:03.914 --> 27:05.207
Because they're professionals,

27:05.249 --> 27:06.542
because that's what we do.
You know?

27:06.584 --> 27:07.668
We take care of each other,

27:07.710 --> 27:09.879
we-we help each other out.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.964
All the time, always.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.799
Let's face it, man.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.009
You would never go past
the first round

27:15.051 --> 27:16.218
of the competition, ever.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.720
You are saying that

27:17.762 --> 27:20.389
because you feel
threatened by me.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.350
:
Threatened by you?

27:22.391 --> 27:23.809
-Yes.
-No.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.102
No, I don't feel
threatened by you.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.521
I feel threatened by...
by Beethoven,

27:27.563 --> 27:28.939
by Mozart.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.943
I actually feel
strong panic right now,

27:32.985 --> 27:34.945
because music has stopped
talking to me.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.156
Like... at all.

27:37.198 --> 27:38.407
You know?

27:40.368 --> 27:43.037
I think that Wolfgang
would have never finished

27:43.079 --> 27:45.373
-the Requiem the way you did.
-He would have.

27:45.414 --> 27:48.751
-No. -You, you know very little
about Mozart, Maestro.

27:48.793 --> 27:51.212
You can't process data.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.922
Most humans can't.

27:52.963 --> 27:55.549
Well, you know what
most robots can't do?

27:55.591 --> 27:56.926
No. Please tell me.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.219
Do you really want to know?

27:58.260 --> 27:59.637
Tell me.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.222
Most robots can't do this.
Do you want to know?

28:01.263 --> 28:04.183
I do want to know.
What can't most robots do?

28:04.225 --> 28:06.644
-Swim.
-Interesting.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.105
And... wha..?
