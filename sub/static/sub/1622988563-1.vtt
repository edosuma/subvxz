WEBVTT

02:24.937 --> 02:26.438
Yeah. Yeah.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.694
Right up there.
Right up in here.

02:31.777 --> 02:32.820
There we go.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.162
Aim for the rock!

03:08.564 --> 03:10.858
-Mankins!
- Yeah?

03:10.941 --> 03:13.819
You want to tell me why
your methane sensors are off?

03:17.740 --> 03:19.491
I don’t know.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.076
Maybe the batteries are dead.

03:22.244 --> 03:23.454
Why don’t you get us a canary.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.497
This is no joke.

03:25.581 --> 03:28.208
These are to alert you
to concentrations of methane.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.294
They must stay on.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.867
Where’d that come from?

04:03.327 --> 04:05.329
Sounds like the open pit.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.247
We hit a methane pocket.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.041
That’s impossible.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.877
Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

04:16.090 --> 04:17.591
Come on!
- Go!

04:19.426 --> 04:20.928
Go, go.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.346
No!

04:35.067 --> 04:37.277
-

04:39.530 --> 04:41.115
Help me!

04:47.162 --> 04:50.082
Go, go, go!
-

05:01.385 --> 05:05.180
Drive, drive

05:11.895 --> 05:14.606
With any man

05:14.690 --> 05:17.317
At five

05:17.401 --> 05:22.823
Drive, drive, drive, drive

05:27.369 --> 05:29.455
What you got, Gurty?

05:29.538 --> 05:32.958
Come on, you can say it.
You can say it.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.170
We will sort right here,

05:36.253 --> 05:38.630
and they will save their hands
right there.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.133
The coffee saved with water
for me.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.843
For him. For them.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.636
Is it coffee, Gurty?

05:51.101 --> 05:54.480
This how you guys
still get your kicks, huh?

05:55.814 --> 05:58.067
Walk away, Gurty.
They’re idiots.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.359
Hey...

06:01.361 --> 06:04.239
how’s it feel to be best friends
with a retard?

06:06.533 --> 06:09.453
He’s my brother,
Johansson.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.538
And I told you
never to call him that.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.707
Retard.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.344
McCann, get in here!

06:28.597 --> 06:30.474
I know what you get,
but I talk with a lot

06:30.557 --> 06:33.519
of hands for hands
sometimes.

06:33.602 --> 06:34.686
Gurty.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.357
We’re fired.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.362
But tires to a point
rotated go.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.864
Let someone else rotate them.
We’re fired.

06:45.948 --> 06:49.243
Pack your shit up.
Skeeter too. Come on.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.877
I don’t want.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.380
Me never been in,
and then today we don’t.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.383
Gurty, I don’t care.
You’re going in.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.927
They’re going
to look after you.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.012
We’ve been together
a long time,

07:09.096 --> 07:13.183
but he can’t hold a job,
and I can’t carry him anymore.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.061
I don’t have a lot of tire left
on my own treads.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.604
-Will this help

07:17.688 --> 07:19.481
make him self-sufficient,
doctor?

07:19.565 --> 07:21.108
I can’t promise anything

07:21.191 --> 07:23.318
with language cognition scores
like these,

07:23.402 --> 07:25.696
but we’ll see
what we can do.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.324
Hi, John, I’m Dr. Talbot.
Pleased to meet you.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.202
Thank you, I appreciate it and
hope the world lasts for you.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.787
He’s saying hello.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.998
How long to go with them?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.708
With them for the time over.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.293
For them. For me.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.879
He’s asking what all this
entails, doctor.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.380
Well, just a few tests.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.591
If he qualifies
for rehabilitation,

07:45.674 --> 07:47.259
we arrange housing.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.927
Should take no more
than an hour.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.679
Skeeter.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.598
You can’t bring Skeeter
in here.

07:52.681 --> 07:56.059
Let them poke and prod you.
It’s no big deal.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.769
I’ll see you in an hour.

07:59.688 --> 08:03.025
Hey, don’t be a big baby.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.902
-Thanks, Doctor.
-You’re welcome.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.863
John, the examination room
is just down the hall.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.073
Psych evaluator Hackman,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.284
dial 617.

08:12.367 --> 08:16.455
Psych evaluator Hackman
dial 617.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.793
No readings indicated
a methane gas pocket?

08:21.877 --> 08:23.212
So you’re saying,

08:23.295 --> 08:25.047
as general manager
of this facility,

08:25.130 --> 08:27.341
that this was
out of the blue?

08:27.424 --> 08:29.343
Completely out of the blue, sir.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.929
We think the gas built up behind
the stoping shields

08:32.012 --> 08:34.681
where our PDM sensors
couldn’t pick it up.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.475
I’m briefing the prime minister
in 20 minutes.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.060
Listen carefully.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.103
No one goes in any
of the tunnels

08:40.187 --> 08:42.689
until that gas
is drilled and capped.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.858
Understood, sir.
Understood.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.819
Let me ask you,
how do we drill and cap

08:47.903 --> 08:50.572
a methane pocket
without a wellhead?

08:52.241 --> 08:53.909
I’ll get back to you.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.122
Get me the air force base
in Winnipeg,

08:59.206 --> 09:01.750
officer in charge
of civilian emergencies.

09:03.961 --> 09:08.090
Airlift a 30-ton gas wellhead?
Impossible.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.801
And there’s no runway
up at Katka to land a C-130 on,

09:10.884 --> 09:12.386
and our largest choppers
are Chinooks,

09:12.469 --> 09:14.805
which can’t carry
a 30-ton wellhead.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.307
Payloads of that nature
have to go by truck.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.897
Jill, that young field officer
in Winnipeg is supposed

09:23.981 --> 09:25.857
to know everything
about ice road transports

09:25.941 --> 09:27.276
up to the northern mines?

09:27.359 --> 09:28.860
Max Tully?
-Yes, him.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.779
The prime minister
will see you now.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.447
Just a sec.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.199
Max Tully?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.119
Mr. Goldenrod!

09:38.036 --> 09:39.037
What?

09:42.958 --> 09:45.043
I’m Max Tully
with Mining Safety.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.296
Could I have a word with you?
It’s about Katka Mine.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.131
What about Katka?

09:49.214 --> 09:51.133
This morning,
tunnel six collapsed.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.010
I need an 18-foot gas wellhead,

09:53.093 --> 09:56.013
300 feet of pipe delivered
up there in under 30 hours.

09:56.096 --> 10:00.392
Eighteen-foot gas wellhead
and 300 feet of pipe?

10:00.475 --> 10:02.853
Goddamn, that’s a hell
of a lot of weight, son.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.439
-Can you make it happen?
-What do I look like, God?

10:05.522 --> 10:07.065
We’re three weeks into April.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.109
All my drivers are on their way
to Hawaii,

10:09.192 --> 10:11.695
or wherever the hell it is that
they go during the off-season.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.156
Say, for conversation’s sake,
you have replacements.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.700
We’ll say for conversation’s
sake that these rigs have wings.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.660
What have you been smoking?

10:18.744 --> 10:21.455
March 10th, the season ended.
That’s five weeks ago.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.082
Didn’t old-timers back in the
’60s drive the lake into April?

10:24.166 --> 10:26.209
Yeah, and most of them died
doing it.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.045
So it’s really
that dangerous.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.713
Yeah. It’s that dangerous.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.798
Okay, okay.
It’s a stupid idea.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.383
Sorry for asking.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.639
Hey, hey, kid.
Come here.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.520
I know all the miners
up there in Katka.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.397
I know their families.

10:47.481 --> 10:50.359
So it’s personal with me.

10:50.442 --> 10:54.237
If I can get drivers
and a mechanic...

10:54.321 --> 10:55.822
let’s say 3:00 this afternoon,

10:55.906 --> 10:58.033
and if you can get
the provincial government

10:58.116 --> 10:59.868
to open up the ice road,

10:59.951 --> 11:02.162
two very big ifs...

11:05.749 --> 11:06.917
we’ll do it.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.336
Thank you.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.132
Shit.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.596
Hi. Um...

11:23.308 --> 11:25.227
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

11:25.310 --> 11:27.062
I brought my brother in
this morning.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.064
Vocational rehab?

11:29.147 --> 11:30.690
McCann, 813.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.234
He’s still being evaluated, sir.

11:32.317 --> 11:36.071
The doctor said an hour.
It’s been two and a half.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.614
We’re a little
short-staffed today,

11:37.697 --> 11:38.698
so please take a seat.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.536
Hey! Sir?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.204
Sir!

11:44.287 --> 11:45.747
Get Security on 2-East, please.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.711
Hey, bro.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.673
What’s happening?

11:55.340 --> 11:56.716
What is all this?

12:01.471 --> 12:03.223
Oh, geez.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.226
What is going on here?

12:06.309 --> 12:08.395
Xanax and Lexapro, right?

12:08.478 --> 12:10.397
Probably some Oxy
for good measure?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.149
You know,
to take the edge off?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.401
-They’re for PTSD.
-I know what they’re for.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.403
Did you ask for these, Gurty?

12:16.486 --> 12:19.156
He has insomnia, hypertension,
makes inappropriate outbursts.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.491
Oh, kiss my Irish ass.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.202
Post-traumatic stress disorder
is real.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.954
I can Section 502 him.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.873
Do it.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.416
The press’ll love
another story

12:29.499 --> 12:31.543
about how the VA
overprescribes opioids

12:31.626 --> 12:32.878
to America’s heroes.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.297
You are making
a grave mistake.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.841
You try and stop us
from leaving here, so are you.

12:40.469 --> 12:41.803
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.263
Here, put this on.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.390
It’s cold.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.144
Wait, here. Here.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.191
Come on, your pants.

13:22.761 --> 13:23.970
Ken-- Kenworth.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.305
More Ken.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.933
Take us great that owned we.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.519
-We.
-Sure, sure.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.522
It would be great if we owned
our own rig.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.315
Did you win the lottery?

13:35.398 --> 13:38.485
Did you happen to win
the Pick-6 and not tell me?

13:38.568 --> 13:41.196
This thing costs 200 grand,
Gurty.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.990
200.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.975
Ever been to Winnipeg,
Gurty?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.811
It’s just 70 miles.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.567
"Win a pig."

15:01.276 --> 15:03.445
We might, partner.

15:03.528 --> 15:07.574
With any luck,
today we might just win a pig.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.415
News all day, every day.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.001
Our top story:
twin explosions rocked

15:18.084 --> 15:20.378
northern Manitoba’s Katka mine
this morning,

15:20.462 --> 15:21.963
killing eight miners

15:22.047 --> 15:23.965
and leaving 26 more
unaccounted for.

15:24.049 --> 15:27.177
The cause of the explosion
has not been determined.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.346
Hi, I’m calling from
Trapper Transpo in Winnipeg.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.889
We’re in an emergency
and need drivers.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.515
Tully, give me 50 bucks.
You got 50 bucks?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.601
-Yeah, I do.
-One of my drivers

15:34.684 --> 15:37.228
-just became available. Thanks.
-Fantastic. What’s it for?

15:37.312 --> 15:38.980
-Bail.
-What?

15:39.064 --> 15:40.607
Told you this wasn’t
going to be easy.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.865
Sunglasses and keys.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.201
You protest
and throw rocks again,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.328
we’ll arrest you again.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.373
We’re going to keep doing it
until you get off our land.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.375
The city owns
that parking lot.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.252
I was referring
to North America.

16:02.754 --> 16:03.963
See you soon.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.311
How’s the fight
for justice going?

16:20.689 --> 16:22.357
Keep building casinos,

16:22.440 --> 16:24.776
you’ll beat the white man
without a shot fired.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.908
You heard about the cave-in
up at Katka?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.993
Yeah, it was on
the TV in there.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.663
I still haven’t heard from Cody,
though. I’m worried sick.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.250
He’s on the list
of those missing.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.752
I’m putting together
a little rescue mission.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.671
Ice road?

16:44.754 --> 16:45.797
Yup.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.427
I’m in.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.367
Let’s get a head count.
Cody.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.412
One.

17:17.495 --> 17:18.913
Two.
-Three.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.291
-Four.
-Five.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.209
-Six.
-Seven.

17:23.293 --> 17:24.627
-Eight.
-Nine.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.004
-Ten
-Eleven.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.839
-Twelve.
-Thirteen.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.145
I got a wife and kids, Jim.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.813
How would I even
explain this to them?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.607
No one’s going to force you
to go, Dave.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.526
I understand,
it’s not for everyone. Thanks.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.320
-What do you got?
-Half are retired,

17:50.403 --> 17:52.030
half have never seen
an ice road.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.240
Next, there are two guys
up from North Dakota.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.784
Brothers.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.494
Thank you.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.500
Which one of you guys
is Mike McCann?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.210
I am.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.628
You’re the driver?
He’s the mechanic?

18:06.711 --> 18:08.087
Yup. One of the best.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.424
Says you had experience

18:11.508 --> 18:13.301
on the ice road
in the Northwest Territory.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.470
That’s pretty serious country.
What’d you drive?

18:15.553 --> 18:17.472
Anything on wheels.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.308
Says you’ve had 11 gigs
in the last eight years,

18:20.391 --> 18:22.352
which ain’t exactly
inspiring my confidence.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.271
There some reason
that you can’t hold down a job?

18:29.651 --> 18:32.362
My... My brother’s a veteran.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.489
Got injured in Iraq.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.825
He’s got this thing
called aphasia, which is--

18:36.908 --> 18:38.076
I know what it is.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.911
Long story short,

18:39.994 --> 18:42.038
for the past eight years
I’ve been his caretaker,

18:42.121 --> 18:44.624
for lack of a better word,
and...

18:44.707 --> 18:46.125
-And we--
-I get it, I get it.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.418
I ain’t got time.
What’s his name?

18:47.502 --> 18:48.837
Call him Gurty.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.172
Gurty. Hey.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.716
Gurty, Jim Goldenrod.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.718
Grab your tool set,
follow me.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.521
Right here.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.481
I want you to pull
the rocker arm shaft.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.109
I’m going to time you.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.574
Say when.

19:20.243 --> 19:21.244
-Go.
-

19:41.222 --> 19:42.557
Sweet Jesus.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.979
Okay, Tully,

19:49.105 --> 19:50.857
send everybody else home
and call Katka.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.984
-I got my crew.
- Where’s Tantoo?

19:53.067 --> 19:54.986
She’s re-parking
somebody else’s rig.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.245
She seems
a little young.

20:08.499 --> 20:11.044
-I’ll have contracts drawn up.
-Thank you.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.381
Enough.

20:15.465 --> 20:19.093
Anyone not out by now
isn’t coming out.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.683
You guys hearing that?

20:25.767 --> 20:27.977
- What is that?

20:32.148 --> 20:33.775
That sounds like tap code.

20:33.858 --> 20:37.403
-You men, give us a hand.
-

20:37.487 --> 20:41.991
Somebody had to have been
in the Army, Navy, Cub Scouts.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.370
-

20:51.459 --> 20:53.044
What are they saying, Cody?

20:53.127 --> 20:54.879
"How many are alive?"

20:54.963 --> 20:56.965
Look, if you do hear something,

20:57.048 --> 20:59.050
-you call me, all right?
-Yes, sir.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.519
-Uh...

21:09.602 --> 21:12.605
26... alive.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.440
Fred, listen to me.
Listen to me.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.484
You tell them we’re going
to cap that methane

21:16.567 --> 21:19.112
with a wellhead, all right?
And then we’re going to blast.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.864
You tell them those wellheads
are coming ASAP, all right?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.449
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.792
Wellheads arrive ASAP.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.253
What do they mean, ASAP?

21:35.336 --> 21:36.421
Six hours?

21:37.213 --> 21:38.214
Twelve hours?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.799
What if it’s 30?

21:39.882 --> 21:41.592
Then we’re dead.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.684
The 26 includes Lampard.

21:50.768 --> 21:51.894
Yup.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.146
Mankins?

21:54.939 --> 21:57.025
He’s alive.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.153
So the question is time.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.239
I mean, no one’s ever lasted
over 30 hours under permafrost.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.120
Well, the government’s
got that ice road open.

22:09.203 --> 22:14.000
Safety supervisor guy, he’s even
managed to secure transpo.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.753
Jim Goldenrod.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.006
If Jim Goldenrod believes
25-ton wellheads

22:20.089 --> 22:22.341
can roll across
a frozen lake in April,

22:22.425 --> 22:24.927
I suppose we should
believe it too.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.889
All right.
These wellheads are beasts.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.808
Eighteen feet long,
25 ton heavy.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.561
We got three rigs,
all identically equipped

22:33.644 --> 22:36.814
so that we can achieve
tactical redundancy.

22:36.898 --> 22:39.275
We’re taking every chance
to save those miners’ lives.

22:39.358 --> 22:43.112
-Tactical re-what-ancy?
- Redundancy.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.448
Each rig doesn’t need the others
to complete the mission.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.533
Gold star to the man
from North Dakota.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.912
One, two, three.
The gold one is mine.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.997
You two can paper/rock/scissors
for the red one.

22:53.081 --> 22:55.124
She’s the one
with the comfy seats.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.337
It’s all yours.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.632
The contracts.

23:02.715 --> 23:03.883
-One for you.
-Thanks.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.760
One for you. And you.

23:05.843 --> 23:08.387
Two hundred thousand
split four ways.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.431
Any questions?

23:10.515 --> 23:13.559
What happens to anyone that
doesn’t make it? To their money?

23:13.643 --> 23:15.812
Paragraph four. Their share goes
to those that do.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.939
-That’s pretty cold.
-Sounds fair to me.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.023
Who’s that guy?

23:19.774 --> 23:21.234
Mr. Varnay.

23:22.485 --> 23:25.488
Tom Varnay, Katka International
Insurance Group.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.865
Tully, these are my trucks.
I say who goes.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.700
They’re your trucks,
but it’s Katka’s insurance.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.619
So if one goes in the lake,
it’s on Katka.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.539
-He’s not taking a cut?
-No, no, no. Absolutely not.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.792
I’m just along for the ride and
to protect Katka’s investment.

23:37.875 --> 23:41.212
All right, you’ll ride with
Tantoo in the black Kenworth.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.631
Put your gear in there.
You two will find safety bags

23:43.714 --> 23:45.466
in the locker area.
It’s time to load up.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.844
We’ll fuel the rigs
and we’ll push in 15.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.931
Thank you. Thanks.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.474
-Thank you.
-Hello.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.355
Fifty grand apiece times two.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.399
That’s more than enough
for a down payment

24:01.482 --> 24:03.025
on a rig like this.

24:04.902 --> 24:08.114
Sorry I ripped up your brochure,
by the way.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.908
I’m going to put Skeeter
up front with us, okay?

24:10.992 --> 24:12.535
Where are you?

24:16.747 --> 24:18.332
Tantoo, is it?

24:18.416 --> 24:19.917
Tully says you’re Cree.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.003
What’s your name mean?

24:24.505 --> 24:26.090
Name mean...

24:26.174 --> 24:27.758
"like to drive alone."

24:31.596 --> 24:33.472
Mount up!

24:33.556 --> 24:35.349
Use the head
if you have to now.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.934
We’re on a bull run.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.312
See you on the flip side,
Tully.

25:23.064 --> 25:26.108
We’ll run with 200-foot
separations,

25:26.192 --> 25:27.735
leapfrogging every few hours.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.196
-Everyone good with that?
-Yup.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.740
Affirmativo.

25:32.823 --> 25:33.866
First leg:

25:33.950 --> 25:35.826
Lake Winnipeg ice road.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.954
About 300 miles,
20 hours.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.665
Second leg: up and over
Manitoba Pass.

25:40.748 --> 25:45.086
Third leg: Manitonka ice road
to Old Manitonka Bridge.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.879
Twenty-three hours total.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.048
What’s wrong
with New Manitonka?

25:49.131 --> 25:50.925
The new bridge
would be preferred,

25:51.008 --> 25:53.219
but getting up to New Manitonka
is another 90 kilometers.

25:53.302 --> 25:56.597
That puts us outside the miners’
oxygen window.

25:56.681 --> 25:58.891
Old Manitonka
was built in the ’60s,

25:58.975 --> 26:00.977
so that’s rated 75,000 pounds?

26:01.060 --> 26:03.938
Yup. We’re going to be
shaving it close.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.564
Here we go, people.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.218
Oh, shit.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.305
You said 120 meters that way,

26:37.388 --> 26:38.556
80 that way?

26:38.639 --> 26:40.099
Give or take.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.976
Pretty decent
atmospheric volume.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.687
Yeah, except we got 26 sets
of lungs down here.

26:51.402 --> 26:54.530
Hey, Jim.
-Yeah.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.033
I thought I heard every
trucker’s expression,

26:57.116 --> 26:59.493
so what the heck’s a bull run?

26:59.577 --> 27:01.954
Bull run?
Well, back in Minnesota,

27:02.038 --> 27:04.248
all the livestock haulers
never used to stop,

27:04.332 --> 27:06.167
because bulls, you see,
got to be standing

27:06.250 --> 27:07.918
when they’re being transported.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.962
As soon as one gets tired
and lies down,

27:10.046 --> 27:11.672
then the others
will step on him and kill him.

27:11.756 --> 27:13.090
All livestock haulers
know this,

27:13.174 --> 27:14.592
so they never stop
for anything.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.469
Ah, I see.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.262
I’m learning
something tonight.

27:21.474 --> 27:24.101
And a White

27:24.185 --> 27:27.146
In sight

27:29.106 --> 27:31.776
Make it home tonight

27:31.859 --> 27:34.445
Like a month

27:34.528 --> 27:37.698
Goodbye

27:37.782 --> 27:39.617
A lot of women

27:39.700 --> 27:42.203
Some of the guys

27:53.756 --> 27:56.592
Running down the track

27:56.675 --> 27:59.970
He ain’t coming back

28:03.224 --> 28:05.017
Hey, Jim, how are you feeling
about the ice?

28:07.812 --> 28:10.272
Cold, hard and stiff.

28:10.356 --> 28:14.026
I wish we weren’t running
in bright sunshine tomorrow.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.237
Said hello
To the southland

28:56.527 --> 28:57.778
You want a sandwich?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.489
You haven’t eaten
since we left.

29:01.490 --> 29:02.867
You’ll know
when I’m hungry.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.243
It’s very unattractive.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.287
You get cranky?

29:06.996 --> 29:08.247
Worse. I act white.

29:12.710 --> 29:15.504
Tully said you and Goldenrod
had a falling out.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.423
That wasn’t a big deal.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.717
Sounded like a big deal.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.512
He fired me. I got upset
and took a swing at him.

29:23.596 --> 29:24.680
It’s old news.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.853
How’s that Kenworth, boys?

29:31.645 --> 29:33.564
She’s a fine ride, Jim.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.858
Thinking we might get one
just like it.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.028
Well, what you gonna call her?

29:39.111 --> 29:40.779
-Take your time, boys.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.324
Naming a big rig’s
a sacred thing.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.701
What’ll we name our truck,
Gurty?

29:47.119 --> 29:49.580
Truck-truck-truck.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.707
You hear that?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.417
"Truck-truck-truck."
I like it.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.960
It’s got a ring to it.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.926
It is beautiful
out here.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.642
Is this really
that dangerous?

30:09.725 --> 30:11.060
It doesn’t seem
like a big deal.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.188
What exactly do you do?

30:15.481 --> 30:17.900
I’m an actuary.
A risk assessment professional,

30:17.983 --> 30:19.443
if we’re being formal.

30:19.527 --> 30:21.987
Well, Mr. Varnay,

30:22.071 --> 30:25.407
hauling heavy cargo
on ice in April is a big deal.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.868
See Custer’s head there?

30:28.869 --> 30:30.955
Tips us off
to pressure waves.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.916
You go too fast,
you create a pressure wave.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.876
In you go.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.504
You go too slow,
the ice can’t handle

30:38.587 --> 30:40.714
the pounds per square inch
on your tire.

30:41.882 --> 30:43.092
In you go.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.908
What the hell was that? Over.

31:07.992 --> 31:10.202
Sounds like my head gasket.

31:12.288 --> 31:15.082
Come on, kid. Come on!

31:29.013 --> 31:31.765
Sweet Jesus,
that ain’t good.

31:41.859 --> 31:42.943
Shit.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.829
Shit.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.289
Whoa, what the hell
are you doing?

31:55.372 --> 31:57.082
Going back.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.959
I thought we weren’t stopping
for anything.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.419
You know, all that
"bull run" stuff?

32:00.502 --> 32:02.963
I said, we’re going back.

32:03.047 --> 32:04.632
Goddamn it!

32:04.715 --> 32:07.384
-

32:32.910 --> 32:35.746
Gurty’s going to run diagnostics
while we hook up.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.331
We’ll pull together.

32:37.414 --> 32:40.459
Use the nylon snatch pulleys
on the rear

32:40.542 --> 32:42.086
so the rigs can swing.

32:52.429 --> 32:55.224
Is this...
this going to work?

32:55.307 --> 32:58.769
How far are we gonna...
gonna tow him?

32:58.852 --> 33:00.312
All the way to the mine?

33:02.064 --> 33:03.565
Do us all a favor,
Mr. Varnay,

33:03.649 --> 33:05.359
and get back in your truck.

33:35.556 --> 33:37.558
Shit. Come on.

33:48.110 --> 33:49.319
Oh...

33:50.195 --> 33:51.739
Gurty!

33:51.822 --> 33:53.115
Clear out.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.451
What happened?

33:55.534 --> 33:56.994
Rear trailer tires went in.

33:57.077 --> 33:58.954
-

33:59.037 --> 34:00.372
Oh, shit.

34:05.002 --> 34:06.754
What the hell’s going on?

34:07.629 --> 34:08.797
Come on, Jim.

34:50.964 --> 34:54.343
Jim! Jim! Jim!

34:54.426 --> 34:57.387
Tow line’s got me!
Cut me loose. My leg’s broken.

35:00.182 --> 35:01.767
Cut me loose
or you’re all going in!

35:01.850 --> 35:03.018
The tow line’s got me

35:03.101 --> 35:04.144
and my leg’s broken. Do it.

35:05.813 --> 35:07.856
-Do it!
-I can’t.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.274
Do it! Do it!

35:14.363 --> 35:15.781
Jesus.

35:24.498 --> 35:25.582
Holy shit!

35:29.878 --> 35:31.421
It’s spreading out.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.966
Meaning what?

35:34.049 --> 35:36.510
Meaning it’s going
to keep cracking for two,

35:36.593 --> 35:38.387
maybe three thousand meters.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.847
That’s over a mile.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.807
We’ll outrun it.
Let’s move!

35:41.890 --> 35:43.517
We got to unhook first.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.394
There’s no time.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.146
We’re going to have to run
tied together. Go!

35:55.612 --> 35:57.197
Get your harness on.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.969
Mike, come in. We got
to hike up the speed. Over.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.053
Roger.

36:43.952 --> 36:45.954
Mike, come in.
We got to run faster.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.540
Roger. Gurty, running board.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.840
-Get out. On the running board.
-Why?

36:56.924 --> 36:58.508
So if we go through,
we can jump clear.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.155
Got a pressure wave
ahead of me.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.367
Well, I got one hell
of an ice crack behind me here,

37:23.450 --> 37:24.993
so how do you want to die?

37:32.584 --> 37:35.462
Slush bed at 200 yards.
Get in and buckle up.

37:37.798 --> 37:41.009
Hang on, pal.
This is going to get ugly.

37:47.641 --> 37:49.059
This is not good.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.019
This is not good.
This is not good!

37:58.068 --> 37:59.611
I don’t like this!

38:04.241 --> 38:07.077
-Shit!
-

38:21.508 --> 38:22.759
I’ve got your seat belt.

38:22.843 --> 38:25.345
You okay, pal?

38:40.569 --> 38:42.195
We’re finished.

38:53.081 --> 38:54.750
It stopped.

38:58.754 --> 38:59.755
Yeah.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.506
It stopped!

39:01.590 --> 39:03.592
We capsized for a reason.

39:03.675 --> 39:07.596
Now our weight’s displaced
evenly instead of on the tires.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.226
So based on seven liters
per minute, per man...

39:13.310 --> 39:15.062
Seven liters?

39:15.145 --> 39:16.897
That’s all a grown man
breathes?

39:16.980 --> 39:20.484
When at rest, the figure doubles
with physical exertion.

39:20.567 --> 39:23.904
Hey, Cody,
can I ask you something?

39:23.987 --> 39:26.406
-Sure.
-When the mine blew up,

39:26.490 --> 39:28.533
I said we hit
a methane pocket

39:28.617 --> 39:30.827
and you said
"That’s impossible."

39:30.911 --> 39:32.079
Why?

39:36.833 --> 39:38.251
It’s still settling.

39:55.977 --> 39:58.063
Air compressor.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.816
Thank God,
they’re coming through.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.030
Failed.

40:10.367 --> 40:12.702
Hey, what’s the story, Cody?

40:13.954 --> 40:17.040
Yeah. What’d they say?

40:25.132 --> 40:27.551
They say they’re still
working on it.

40:31.638 --> 40:32.848
-Cody.
- Yeah?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.690
You didn’t answer
my question.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.276
Why is it impossible
we hit a methane pocket?

40:49.406 --> 40:51.700
Because I was told
it would never happen.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.034
By who?

40:53.118 --> 40:54.744
Who told you that?

40:57.247 --> 40:58.790
Cody.

41:03.837 --> 41:06.089
Easy, boys! Easy! Get him out!

41:06.173 --> 41:07.966
Easy!

41:12.929 --> 41:14.264
Cody!

41:16.975 --> 41:19.895
-Whoa! Whoa!
-

41:40.040 --> 41:42.000
SOS. SOS.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.752
41.40.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.879
Ice road north of 53.

41:45.962 --> 41:47.672
Kenworth through the ice.

41:47.756 --> 41:50.091
Repeat:
Kenworth through the ice.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.010
Copy. Are there survivors?

41:52.093 --> 41:53.970
Negative.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.890
We are responding,
thank you.

41:56.973 --> 41:59.809
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What about us?

41:59.893 --> 42:01.686
What about us?

42:05.440 --> 42:07.484
We’re heading back, right?

42:09.152 --> 42:11.154
-Back?
-Yeah.

42:11.238 --> 42:13.156
That’s what I said.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.951
The ice is bound to be thinner
to the south, not thicker.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.786
We still have two
deliverable wellheads.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.454
Tactical redundancy,
remember?

42:19.537 --> 42:21.748
And we’re more
than halfway there.

42:21.831 --> 42:22.999
What do you think, Gurty?

42:24.751 --> 42:27.128
Attaboy. Are you coming with,
Tantoo?

42:27.212 --> 42:29.631
-Hell, yeah.
-What? This is ridiculous.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.549
You’re all going to die.

42:31.633 --> 42:32.884
You want to go back,
go back.

42:32.968 --> 42:35.720
I suggest you do it quick.

42:37.722 --> 42:38.974
Nichiiwad.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.558
The big one.

42:40.642 --> 42:42.352
Drop 50 degrees,

42:42.435 --> 42:45.647
we’ll pick up 8 to 10
centimeters of new ice.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.066
Let’s get the rigs upright
and haul ass.

42:48.149 --> 42:49.609
We’re back in business.

42:49.693 --> 42:52.195
You’re out of your minds.
All of you!

42:52.279 --> 42:53.571
Wait, wait, wait.

42:54.698 --> 42:56.700
It appears you’re the new
leader here, so--

42:56.783 --> 42:58.034
I’m not the leader
of anything.

42:58.118 --> 42:59.577
Everyone’s on their own.

42:59.661 --> 43:02.122
Fine. Whatever.

43:03.999 --> 43:06.876
You’re not curious
about back there, what happened?

43:06.960 --> 43:08.670
We saw what happened.

43:08.753 --> 43:11.381
No, I’m talking about
the seized-up engine.

43:14.301 --> 43:15.510
Go on.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.307
How well do you know her?
Tantoo?

43:20.390 --> 43:23.101
Met her first time yesterday.
Why?

43:26.646 --> 43:28.690
Mind answering
a couple of questions?

43:30.233 --> 43:33.528
You worked for Jim Goldenrod,
what, two years?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.655
Two and a half.

43:37.198 --> 43:38.533
Why’d it end?

43:40.285 --> 43:43.038
I used his rig on the weekend
without permission.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.332
So you’re a thief.

43:45.415 --> 43:47.083
I’m not a thief.

43:47.167 --> 43:49.294
Hey, I was hauling banners
for a demon--

43:51.129 --> 43:52.881
What is this
your business?

43:52.964 --> 43:55.091
You weren’t a happy camper,
were you?

43:55.175 --> 43:56.176
When he fired you?

43:57.135 --> 44:00.388
No, I... Look, just--

44:00.472 --> 44:04.100
I’ve never seen a Kenworth with
less than 10k on the odometer

44:04.184 --> 44:07.812
-just up and quit, have you?
-No.

44:07.896 --> 44:10.357
Most diesel engines
don’t seize on their own.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.192
Unless they burn gasoline.

44:13.401 --> 44:15.403
What’s this about?

44:15.487 --> 44:18.448
You dosed Goldenrod’s rig with
gas while we were loading up.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.116
I saw you next to the pump.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.118
You said you were checking
the tire pressure.

44:22.202 --> 44:23.787
That is a goddamn lie.

44:23.870 --> 44:26.498
You were going to take us
all out, weren’t you?

44:26.581 --> 44:28.500
So you could claim
the whole 200 grand.

44:28.583 --> 44:30.126
No, I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

44:30.210 --> 44:31.878
Who else, then?
It wasn’t me.

44:31.961 --> 44:33.671
Wasn’t Gurty.
Wasn’t him.

44:33.755 --> 44:35.799
He works for the company
that’s paying us.

44:35.882 --> 44:38.134
This is not about the money
for me, you idiots!

44:38.218 --> 44:40.053
God, my brother
is in that mine.

44:40.136 --> 44:42.514
And the longer that we stand
here, the closer he is to dying,

44:42.597 --> 44:44.933
-so if you could just move--
-She’s lying.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.267
You can’t trust these people.

44:47.394 --> 44:49.687
Call Katka.
His name is Cody Mantooth.

44:49.771 --> 44:51.940
We have different fathers.

44:52.023 --> 44:55.068
God, "these people"?
You’re a racist asshole...

44:55.151 --> 44:57.487
-You’re not going anywhere.
-Look, just get out--

44:57.570 --> 44:59.364
-You’re not going anywhere.
-Fine.

44:59.447 --> 45:01.491
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:11.418 --> 45:13.294
We call the company
and check your story.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.171
Yeah, and then
go fuck yourself.

45:15.255 --> 45:17.173
Tie her up, Gurty.

46:09.642 --> 46:11.227
Yeah, Tully, it’s Mike.

46:11.311 --> 46:12.896
I just heard about Goldenrod

46:12.979 --> 46:14.689
from County Emergency,
what happened?

46:14.772 --> 46:17.650
We think Tantoo dosed Jim’s rig
with gasoline.

46:17.734 --> 46:20.153
Are you kidding? That’s worse
than putting sugar in the tank.

46:20.236 --> 46:23.364
Contact Katka,
ask them if there’s a miner,

46:23.448 --> 46:26.075
Cody Mantooth,
on the missing list.

46:26.159 --> 46:28.203
-I’ll explain later.
-You got it.

46:40.548 --> 46:43.384
-We want to discuss options.
-Like what?

46:44.344 --> 46:46.012
Like decreasing
our numbers.

46:47.263 --> 46:49.057
I want to talk
to the folks upstairs.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.600
I want to talk to the bosses.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.143
You don’t know tap code.

46:52.227 --> 46:53.603
He does.

46:54.896 --> 46:56.898
You guys can’t be serious.

46:59.234 --> 47:00.610
It’s called triage.

47:00.693 --> 47:02.195
Hospitals do it
all the time.

47:03.863 --> 47:05.573
If we decrease our numbers
by one-third,

47:05.657 --> 47:07.283
our oxygen window increases by--

47:07.367 --> 47:09.452
We can do the math.

47:09.536 --> 47:11.663
Hospitals are
a bullshit analogy.

47:11.746 --> 47:15.792
Patients get triaged when it’s
determined they’d die anyway.

47:16.876 --> 47:18.336
And what about these guys?

47:18.419 --> 47:20.463
They’re not going
to make it till morning.

47:20.547 --> 47:22.465
Well, no one’s going for this.

47:22.549 --> 47:24.217
I agree. It’s nuts.

47:25.552 --> 47:27.637
-Say you’re wrong.
-Say we’re not.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.097
Say we put it to a vote.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.765
What’s he saying, Cody?

47:35.603 --> 47:37.438
They want to decrease
our numbers.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.107
Can’t be serious.

47:40.275 --> 47:42.068
Looks serious to me,
Claude.

47:42.151 --> 47:44.737
Nobody wants this, Barney.
Don’t make it personal.

47:44.821 --> 47:46.781
Hate to tell you, friend,

47:46.864 --> 47:48.491
this is about
as personal as it gets.

47:48.575 --> 47:50.410
Have you guys seen yourselves?

47:50.493 --> 47:52.745
Barney, that compound fracture
has sepsis in it.

47:52.829 --> 47:55.456
And you, Claude, how’s
that fever treating you?

47:55.540 --> 47:57.333
You’re not going to make it
another 12 hours.

47:57.417 --> 47:59.752
-What if we say no?
-It’s going to a vote.

47:59.836 --> 48:01.379
That’s like two foxes
and a chicken

48:01.462 --> 48:02.839
voting on what’s for dinner.

48:02.922 --> 48:05.800
I always knew
you were a prick, Mankins.

48:05.883 --> 48:08.386
I didn’t know until now
you were also a murderer.

48:19.230 --> 48:23.151
"Suggest decreasing our number."
What does that mean?

48:23.234 --> 48:25.028
They mean decreasing
their number.

48:25.111 --> 48:27.614
-Well, how?
-How do you think?

48:28.656 --> 48:29.782
No.

48:30.450 --> 48:32.160
What? No.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.579
No, that’s crazy.
I’m not taking part in this.

48:34.662 --> 48:36.956
We’re not calling the shots
down there, Fred.

48:45.173 --> 48:49.093
Hey, those trailers
smacked down hard.

48:49.177 --> 48:51.512
Gurty and I are going
to go check the loads,

48:51.596 --> 48:53.514
then we’ll push on.

48:55.016 --> 48:56.601
How’s she looking?

49:10.031 --> 49:11.240
Hey! Hey!

49:11.324 --> 49:13.284
-Hey!
- Help! Hey!

49:13.368 --> 49:15.286
- Open the damn door!

49:15.370 --> 49:17.747
Help! Help!
- Open the damn door!

49:17.830 --> 49:20.750
-

49:20.833 --> 49:22.043
Hey!

49:32.387 --> 49:34.180
Open this damn door!

49:54.075 --> 49:55.076
It was you.

49:57.870 --> 49:59.622
You piece of shit.
"Insurance actuary" my ass.

49:59.706 --> 50:01.499
What do you actually do
for Katka?

50:01.582 --> 50:03.918
Let’s just say I work in a...

50:04.001 --> 50:05.753
different department
of the company.

50:05.837 --> 50:07.630
Yeah, the sewer.

50:08.965 --> 50:11.884
Look, here’s the rules.

50:12.635 --> 50:13.886
You behave yourself,

50:13.970 --> 50:15.304
and you can stay
in the restraints

50:15.388 --> 50:17.682
those idiot truckers
put on you.

50:17.765 --> 50:19.892
But you get a little spirited,

50:19.976 --> 50:23.938
which I know is a problem
for you people,

50:24.021 --> 50:25.565
and I will hog-tie you

50:25.648 --> 50:27.817
and throw you in the rear.

50:38.453 --> 50:42.749
-Yeah?

50:42.832 --> 50:44.459
Mike, what’s your status?

50:44.542 --> 50:46.419
No, it’s Varnay.
We’re stuck in a storm.

50:46.502 --> 50:48.171
I’ve got an answer
on that Cody Mantooth...

50:48.254 --> 50:49.630
I can’t talk!

50:54.385 --> 50:56.804
Please work. Please work.

51:02.143 --> 51:04.061
She’s outfitted
with a heater unit.

51:04.145 --> 51:07.607
Hey, Gurty, how heavy do we
think this double mill pipe is?

51:07.690 --> 51:10.902
-Five mill double hundred.
-Huh?

51:13.237 --> 51:15.531
Three...four...zero.

51:15.615 --> 51:17.867
340 each?

51:17.950 --> 51:19.702
Grab hold of the end
of this one.

51:20.787 --> 51:22.455
We’re going
to punch that out.

51:22.538 --> 51:24.415
Punch pipe the pin post.

51:24.499 --> 51:26.042
My thoughts exactly.

52:05.164 --> 52:06.791
Easy.

52:06.874 --> 52:08.125
Easy.

52:14.465 --> 52:15.466
Easy.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.096
One, two, three.

52:27.436 --> 52:29.355
One, two, three.

52:38.739 --> 52:40.867
One, two, three.

52:42.952 --> 52:44.871
One, two, three.

53:47.808 --> 53:49.435
Yes!

53:52.396 --> 53:53.940
Oh, no!

53:55.900 --> 54:00.655
He took the phone,
the pistol, our gear bags.

54:00.738 --> 54:02.657
And the Too.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.533
And the what?

54:04.617 --> 54:06.243
Tantoo.

54:06.327 --> 54:08.079
Tantoo as well.

54:10.873 --> 54:12.708
Let’s figure this out.

55:40.212 --> 55:41.922
What’s the matter with you?

55:42.673 --> 55:43.966
Ease off!

56:07.948 --> 56:09.200
More!

56:09.283 --> 56:11.118
Hike up the pressure!

56:14.830 --> 56:16.665
Gurty!

56:16.749 --> 56:18.417
I said, more!

56:18.501 --> 56:19.835
More!

56:22.046 --> 56:23.422
-Geez.

56:23.506 --> 56:26.092
I said, more!

56:26.175 --> 56:28.010
-Mike!
-Yeah, I see it.

56:28.094 --> 56:29.428
It’s called a winch.

56:29.512 --> 56:32.348
Mike, welding’s a winter snap!

56:32.431 --> 56:33.849
What?

56:33.933 --> 56:36.560
Welding’s not cold!

56:36.644 --> 56:38.896
Just do it!

56:49.323 --> 56:51.242
Do you know why
we get fired?

56:51.325 --> 56:54.995
It’s not your disability.
It’s your freaking attitude.

56:56.413 --> 56:59.834
You probably didn’t take orders
before your disability.

57:04.839 --> 57:07.299
I don’t know
what’s going on here,

57:07.383 --> 57:09.969
but that prick,
he killed Goldenrod

57:10.052 --> 57:11.470
and he nearly killed us.

57:11.554 --> 57:13.639
He pinned it all on Tantoo,

57:13.722 --> 57:15.391
who’s out here
to save her brother,

57:15.474 --> 57:16.809
and we helped him.

57:17.726 --> 57:20.062
We have one chance, one chance

57:20.146 --> 57:23.732
to get out of this
and make this right.

57:23.816 --> 57:25.484
And you’re not going
to wreck it.

57:25.568 --> 57:26.652
Not this time.

57:28.654 --> 57:31.490
-Don’t you dare touch that.

57:42.168 --> 57:43.961
Come on, come on,
come on.

57:49.675 --> 57:50.885
She’s coming free.

58:01.437 --> 58:02.771
What the hell was that?

58:16.035 --> 58:17.661
Gurty? Gurty?

58:18.662 --> 58:19.663
Gurty!

58:21.123 --> 58:23.918
Gurty! Gurty!

59:36.365 --> 59:40.327
Gurty, stay with me.
Stay with me...

1:00:24.163 --> 1:00:26.498
Come on, Gurty.
Come on. Breathe.

1:00:26.582 --> 1:00:27.624
Breathe.

1:00:27.708 --> 1:00:30.252
Come on, Gurty.
Work with me here.

1:00:44.183 --> 1:00:45.684
-Oh, geez.

1:00:49.104 --> 1:00:50.189
Gurty.

1:00:52.691 --> 1:00:54.526
Gurty.

1:00:54.610 --> 1:00:58.155
Jesus. Here, pal. Here, pal.

1:00:58.238 --> 1:01:00.741
Here, pal. I got you.
I got you.

1:01:00.824 --> 1:01:02.701
-I got you.
-

1:01:02.785 --> 1:01:04.078
I got you.

1:01:06.413 --> 1:01:08.374
Gurty, I’m sorry.

1:01:08.457 --> 1:01:10.167
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
I’m sorry I hit you.

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:12.419
I’m sorry.
I didn’t mean to.

1:01:12.503 --> 1:01:14.338
I’m sorry, Gurty.

1:01:18.759 --> 1:01:19.968
Mike...

1:01:24.390 --> 1:01:27.059
Yeah. Sunken dreams, Gurty.

1:01:28.185 --> 1:01:29.853
Sunken dreams.

1:01:30.854 --> 1:01:32.981
Yeah. It’s eating at me too.

1:01:34.900 --> 1:01:38.654
Why would an employee
of the company that hired us

1:01:38.737 --> 1:01:40.322
sabotage...?

1:01:44.910 --> 1:01:48.038
They want us to fail. That’s it.

1:01:48.122 --> 1:01:50.999
They want us to fail.
I didn’t see it.

1:01:51.083 --> 1:01:55.379
I’ve been too wrapped up
in what’s in this for us.

1:01:56.630 --> 1:01:58.674
Oh, now I’m angry.

1:02:00.676 --> 1:02:02.177
Let’s get out of here.

1:02:03.595 --> 1:02:05.222
It’s not about money now.

1:02:06.056 --> 1:02:07.641
This is personal.

1:02:38.213 --> 1:02:40.757
Should be 20 minutes
to the shoreline.

1:03:07.534 --> 1:03:10.829
Rig two’s in the lake
20 klicks due south.

1:03:10.913 --> 1:03:12.873
Took the mechanic
and the driver with it.

1:03:12.956 --> 1:03:15.959
I told them not to store
dynamite in the trailer

1:03:16.043 --> 1:03:18.337
due to friction detonation,

1:03:18.420 --> 1:03:21.715
but they had other ideas.

1:03:21.798 --> 1:03:22.925
Good.

1:03:23.008 --> 1:03:24.384
Good. That’s good.

1:03:25.427 --> 1:03:26.512
How about the driver?

1:03:27.262 --> 1:03:29.765
Well, she’s alive, sir.

1:03:35.187 --> 1:03:38.190
Put the cab through
that guardrail up there.

1:03:39.149 --> 1:03:42.236
Your story is
she lost control,

1:03:42.319 --> 1:03:44.696
you dove for safety
before it went over.

1:03:44.780 --> 1:03:47.783
-You clear?
-Clear, sir.

1:03:47.866 --> 1:03:50.577
The miners’ oxygen window
closes in three hours,

1:03:50.661 --> 1:03:53.622
so the press is going to be
all over us.

1:03:53.705 --> 1:03:58.126
They need to be told our
valiant rescue had a tragic end.

1:03:58.210 --> 1:03:59.878
I’ll make it happen, sir.

1:03:59.962 --> 1:04:02.422
Good. Good.

1:04:02.506 --> 1:04:03.966
You call me
when it’s done.

1:04:27.489 --> 1:04:30.325
If you do this,
it’s on your head.

1:04:30.409 --> 1:04:32.119
You want to blame someone,
blame management.

1:04:32.202 --> 1:04:33.829
What has management
got to do with it?

1:04:35.038 --> 1:04:36.498
All those in favor,
raise your--

1:04:36.582 --> 1:04:38.000
Mankins!

1:04:38.083 --> 1:04:39.751
I asked you a question.

1:04:39.835 --> 1:04:41.962
Because they made us
cut the damn sensors, René.

1:04:43.005 --> 1:04:44.006
They what?

1:04:45.507 --> 1:04:47.426
They claimed the new quotas
were killing them,

1:04:47.509 --> 1:04:50.512
so they couldn’t afford
a shutdown.

1:04:50.596 --> 1:04:55.183
They said there was no chance
of gas pockets this far north.

1:04:55.267 --> 1:04:56.977
And they sweetened the deal.

1:04:57.060 --> 1:04:59.062
How much?

1:05:04.067 --> 1:05:06.278
Hundred dollars per man
per month.

1:05:08.572 --> 1:05:11.908
You turned off the gas sensors
for $100 a month?

1:05:11.992 --> 1:05:14.286
And anyone who blew the whistle
gets shit-canned.

1:05:14.369 --> 1:05:15.954
None of that
matters now, René.

1:05:16.038 --> 1:05:17.914
Our oxygen is falling fast.

1:05:17.998 --> 1:05:19.750
There’s a vote on the floor.

1:05:19.833 --> 1:05:21.543
All those in favor,
raise your hands.

1:05:21.627 --> 1:05:23.086
No.

1:05:25.505 --> 1:05:27.466
Hey!

1:05:27.549 --> 1:05:30.010
How much methane do you think
is in here now?

1:05:30.093 --> 1:05:31.303
Huh?

1:05:32.220 --> 1:05:33.889
These men are not
the enemy.

1:05:33.972 --> 1:05:35.474
The enemy’s up there.

1:05:35.557 --> 1:05:36.725
Bullshit!

1:05:36.808 --> 1:05:38.518
The enemy’s asphyxiation.

1:05:38.602 --> 1:05:40.687
We’re getting out of here
together,

1:05:40.771 --> 1:05:42.356
or not at all.

1:05:42.439 --> 1:05:45.192
You’re one stupid
son of a bitch, René.

1:05:47.778 --> 1:05:49.905
You too, Cody.

1:05:49.988 --> 1:05:53.825
Maybe so, but this is how
it’s going to be.

1:06:21.937 --> 1:06:23.355
Right here.

1:06:25.107 --> 1:06:26.233
Let’s clear the road.

1:06:58.598 --> 1:06:59.891
-Ow!
-

1:06:59.975 --> 1:07:01.727
Yeah, that’s what I thought.

1:07:01.810 --> 1:07:03.311
You’re never gonna
get away with this.

1:07:03.395 --> 1:07:04.980
There’s gonna be
an investigation.

1:07:05.063 --> 1:07:07.357
That’s the plan.

1:07:15.365 --> 1:07:16.742
What is that?

1:07:31.798 --> 1:07:33.175
-Ah!

1:08:07.793 --> 1:08:08.794
Thanks.

1:08:38.782 --> 1:08:40.242
Mayday! Mayday!

1:08:40.325 --> 1:08:42.452
Mayday! Come in!
Anybody, come in!

1:08:42.536 --> 1:08:43.745
Mayday! Mayday!

1:08:43.829 --> 1:08:46.248
Mayday! Is anybody out there?

1:08:46.331 --> 1:08:48.375
Tantoo, it’s Mike.

1:08:48.458 --> 1:08:50.043
We’re coming up the Pass.

1:08:50.126 --> 1:08:52.170
-Where are you?
-Approaching the upper traverse.

1:08:52.254 --> 1:08:54.798
I got Varnay behind me
with others. They’re all armed.

1:08:54.881 --> 1:08:57.676
We’ve got two hours to get to
Katka. I’m still pulling weight.

1:08:57.759 --> 1:09:00.679
-They’re trying to stop us.
-Yeah, we figured.

1:09:00.762 --> 1:09:03.265
Cody always said that they cut
corners with the methane regs.

1:09:03.348 --> 1:09:04.975
Those bastards,
they caused the cave-in,

1:09:05.058 --> 1:09:06.434
now they’re trying
to cover it up.

1:09:06.518 --> 1:09:07.978
Not going to happen.

1:09:08.061 --> 1:09:10.146
Just hang on. We’re coming.

1:09:23.368 --> 1:09:26.371
Take them out so it will
pass forensics.

1:09:26.454 --> 1:09:27.831
No bullet holes.

1:09:27.914 --> 1:09:30.333
Do not discharge
your weapons.

1:10:30.352 --> 1:10:31.937
-What?

1:10:38.151 --> 1:10:39.361
Shit.

1:10:39.444 --> 1:10:40.612
Oh, come on.
One more mile.

1:10:40.695 --> 1:10:42.322
We can do one more mile.
Come on.

1:10:45.033 --> 1:10:47.369
Yeah, we can do it.
Come on.

1:11:05.011 --> 1:11:06.012
Pull over!

1:11:08.014 --> 1:11:09.808
Pull over now!

1:11:09.891 --> 1:11:11.184
Pull over!

1:11:13.895 --> 1:11:16.982
If they were going to shoot us,
they would’ve done it by now.

1:11:17.065 --> 1:11:19.401
Yeah. Good. Come on.

1:11:21.194 --> 1:11:22.529
Ready, bro?

1:11:24.698 --> 1:11:26.908
Pull over now!

1:14:38.224 --> 1:14:40.685
Well, don’t just stand there.
Let’s go.

1:14:58.369 --> 1:15:00.455
Come on, come on,
don’t stop, don’t stop.

1:15:00.538 --> 1:15:01.831
Don’t you dare stop.
Come on.

1:15:07.462 --> 1:15:11.007
Don’t do this to me.
Don’t... Don’t do this.

1:15:11.090 --> 1:15:13.218
Come on, keep going.
Don’t stop, don’t stop!

1:15:13.301 --> 1:15:15.094
Come on, you piece of shit.
Let’s go.

1:15:15.178 --> 1:15:17.680
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.
I didn’t mean it!

1:15:42.705 --> 1:15:45.166
Don’t think that I’m not going
to use this on you!

1:15:50.505 --> 1:15:51.839
What’s your game?

1:15:53.675 --> 1:15:56.010
Oh, what, are you just
going to stand there?

1:15:57.762 --> 1:15:59.013
Yeah.

1:15:59.097 --> 1:16:00.807
This is the last wellhead.

1:16:00.890 --> 1:16:02.392
What are you going to do?

1:16:02.475 --> 1:16:04.477
You going to push it
the rest of the way?

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:06.896
Because if you’re going
to make it to Katka

1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:09.315
before your brother
stops breathing,

1:16:09.399 --> 1:16:12.235
that’s what you’re going
to have to do.

1:16:17.031 --> 1:16:19.284
The other drivers
are going to come.

1:16:20.159 --> 1:16:21.911
The other drivers are dead.

1:17:05.079 --> 1:17:07.206
He ripped out
my fuel equalizer.

1:17:07.290 --> 1:17:09.042
Gurty can fix that.

1:17:10.501 --> 1:17:12.253
We’ll change out
your fuel line

1:17:12.337 --> 1:17:15.131
and siphon enough juice
to get you down to Katka.

1:17:17.133 --> 1:17:18.259
Listen...

1:17:18.968 --> 1:17:20.178
we...

1:17:21.012 --> 1:17:22.722
we seriously misjudged you.

1:17:23.806 --> 1:17:24.932
Friends?

1:17:27.894 --> 1:17:28.895
Yeah.

1:18:39.924 --> 1:18:41.676
Hey, how long do you think
all this is going to take?

1:18:41.759 --> 1:18:43.594
A couple of minutes.
I know you’re anxious

1:18:43.678 --> 1:18:45.596
-about your brother.
-Yeah.

1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:47.014
Cody’s all I got, you know?

1:18:47.098 --> 1:18:48.891
It’s kind of like
you and yours.

1:18:48.975 --> 1:18:49.976
Yeah.

1:18:52.270 --> 1:18:55.106
Gurty’s like that commercial.

1:18:55.189 --> 1:18:57.984
Takes a lickin’
but keeps on tickin’.

1:19:51.787 --> 1:19:53.664
That last can should do it.

1:19:54.624 --> 1:19:57.168
He saved my life.
Give him a treat.

1:20:09.388 --> 1:20:12.308
We can’t stay here
and we can’t back up.

1:20:12.391 --> 1:20:13.935
We’ll have to outrun it.

1:20:14.018 --> 1:20:16.395
-You’re dreaming.
-You got a better idea?

1:21:34.015 --> 1:21:35.099
Oh!

1:21:36.809 --> 1:21:38.311
-Oh.
- Uncouple the trailer.

1:21:38.394 --> 1:21:39.729
We got a wellhead
to deliver.

1:21:50.072 --> 1:21:52.283
Oh, geez.

1:21:52.366 --> 1:21:54.535
It’s not as bad as it looks.

1:21:57.121 --> 1:21:59.040
It’s, uh...

1:21:59.123 --> 1:22:02.460
It looks pretty bad, kid.

1:22:02.543 --> 1:22:04.587
-Just be fast about it.
-Uh...

1:22:04.670 --> 1:22:06.255
Like pulling out
a wisdom tooth.

1:22:06.339 --> 1:22:07.882
A wisdom tooth? Do I--

1:22:07.965 --> 1:22:09.425
Do I look like a dentist?

1:22:09.508 --> 1:22:11.052
-Aah!

1:22:12.178 --> 1:22:13.721
Good girl. Good girl.

1:22:13.804 --> 1:22:16.057
-Breathe. Breathe.
-

1:22:16.140 --> 1:22:18.768
That’s it. Good girl.
Good girl.

1:22:18.851 --> 1:22:21.771
Gurty, come and help me!

1:22:21.854 --> 1:22:23.397
-Good girl.

1:22:23.481 --> 1:22:24.523
Good girl.

1:22:25.941 --> 1:22:26.984
Come on.

1:22:34.116 --> 1:22:36.077
Hang tight.

1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:39.205
Gurty and I are going to haul
your trailer off the cliff,

1:22:39.288 --> 1:22:42.625
hook up and head
to that mine.

1:22:42.708 --> 1:22:45.294
We still got 45 minutes.

1:22:45.378 --> 1:22:46.587
Yeah.

1:23:16.283 --> 1:23:19.995
Sir? Mine Safety down in
Winnipeg wants René’s laptops.

1:23:20.079 --> 1:23:22.373
Fred, Mine Safety
gets the laptops

1:23:22.456 --> 1:23:24.500
when I say they get the laptops,
all right?

1:23:24.583 --> 1:23:26.377
We got a goddamn CEO
to worry about.

1:23:26.460 --> 1:23:27.878
Yeah, well, you can
tell him yourself.

1:23:27.962 --> 1:23:29.463
He’ll be here in an hour.

1:23:31.507 --> 1:23:35.094
There is nothing
in those e-mails

1:23:35.177 --> 1:23:37.346
that implicates us.

1:23:37.430 --> 1:23:40.391
Everything was cash,
so there’s no paper trail.

1:23:40.474 --> 1:23:42.351
To the authorities,
this just looks like

1:23:42.435 --> 1:23:45.187
another tragic mining accident.

1:23:49.024 --> 1:23:52.278
Right in the morning,
we open Tunnel 6.

1:23:52.361 --> 1:23:53.946
We remove the bodies.

1:23:54.029 --> 1:23:57.199
We let the public hold
their ritual funerals.

1:23:57.283 --> 1:24:00.911
We weather the obligatory
"occupational hazard" debate.

1:24:02.163 --> 1:24:03.873
And we open back up.

1:24:04.874 --> 1:24:06.667
Business as usual.

1:24:12.131 --> 1:24:14.550
Come on, Varnay,
answer the goddamn phone.

1:25:04.934 --> 1:25:06.352
Look, Gurty, we did it.

1:25:06.435 --> 1:25:07.853
We did it!

1:25:25.454 --> 1:25:27.248
Mike. Mike.

1:27:16.523 --> 1:27:18.025
Give me that pistol!

1:27:19.693 --> 1:27:22.488
Gurty, you got to take
the wheel.

1:27:22.571 --> 1:27:24.239
Come on. You can do it.

1:27:33.958 --> 1:27:36.961
Do not stop until you reach
the mine, got it?

1:27:37.044 --> 1:27:38.420
Do not stop.

1:27:40.673 --> 1:27:43.008
Hey. Kill him.

1:27:43.092 --> 1:27:44.802
Not for me,
for my brother.

1:29:51.095 --> 1:29:53.097
I’ve done this
a thousand times.

1:29:53.931 --> 1:29:56.058
Move. I can do it.

1:30:40.936 --> 1:30:42.146
Shit.

1:30:44.982 --> 1:30:46.900
Traction pads. Yes, go.

1:31:07.129 --> 1:31:08.839
Go! Come on, come on.

1:31:11.800 --> 1:31:13.594
Shit. Shit.

1:31:19.933 --> 1:31:22.853
Gurty, the cables are snapping!
Let’s go! Come on!

1:33:14.756 --> 1:33:16.133
Come on.

1:33:33.608 --> 1:33:35.610
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1:33:49.207 --> 1:33:51.043
Gurty, shut the gate!

1:34:18.612 --> 1:34:20.906
-Gurty!
-

1:34:55.857 --> 1:34:58.193
Gurty. Gurty!

1:35:01.655 --> 1:35:02.948
He saved the rig.

1:35:03.031 --> 1:35:04.449
Oh, Jesus.

1:35:04.533 --> 1:35:05.826
Mike...

1:35:05.909 --> 1:35:07.119
you...

1:35:07.202 --> 1:35:09.287
brother mine.

1:35:09.371 --> 1:35:12.290
My brother.

1:35:17.963 --> 1:35:20.173
Brother. Mine.

1:35:33.478 --> 1:35:35.564
No, no, no, no...

1:35:38.316 --> 1:35:39.609
No.

1:35:41.611 --> 1:35:43.530
I’m sorry.

1:35:43.613 --> 1:35:46.950
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

1:35:47.033 --> 1:35:48.994
I’m so sorry.

1:35:56.835 --> 1:35:59.463
Deputy Minister, Jack Tager,
vice president of operations.

1:35:59.546 --> 1:36:01.006
George Sickle,
general manager.

1:36:01.089 --> 1:36:02.215
-Tager.
-Sir.

1:36:02.299 --> 1:36:03.633
-Sickle.
-How are you, sir?

1:36:03.717 --> 1:36:05.135
It’s cold up here.

1:36:05.218 --> 1:36:06.761
We have hot drink
and food inside, sir.

1:36:06.845 --> 1:36:09.264
How was the drive
down from Gillam Airfield?

1:36:09.347 --> 1:36:12.267
Cut the formalities, Sickle.
Tell me the situation.

1:36:13.477 --> 1:36:18.523
Our last contact
with the rescue team was 0300.

1:36:18.607 --> 1:36:20.859
Deputy Minister,
how about you?

1:36:20.942 --> 1:36:22.694
Your man in Winnipeg.
Heard anything?

1:36:22.777 --> 1:36:24.154
Negative.

1:36:24.237 --> 1:36:25.780
It’s been 30 hours

1:36:25.864 --> 1:36:27.574
and the wellheads
haven’t arrived.

1:36:27.657 --> 1:36:28.992
I don’t believe
the men are going

1:36:29.075 --> 1:36:30.535
to get out
of Tunnel 6 alive.

1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:50.263
What’s that?

1:36:50.347 --> 1:36:52.265
That’s our emergency Klaxon.

1:37:02.150 --> 1:37:03.985
Oh, my God.

1:37:07.113 --> 1:37:10.075
Hey, welcome to Katka.

1:37:10.158 --> 1:37:11.159
You McCann?

1:37:11.243 --> 1:37:12.869
Yeah.

1:37:12.953 --> 1:37:13.995
You need medical?

1:37:21.253 --> 1:37:23.880
Everyone, on the double.
We still have a chance.

1:37:25.298 --> 1:37:27.717
We got another one.
Get me the gurney, ASAP.

1:37:28.843 --> 1:37:30.929
There’s no hurry.

1:37:31.012 --> 1:37:32.305
We need to get that wellhead

1:37:32.389 --> 1:37:33.848
unloaded and bolted down.

1:37:33.932 --> 1:37:35.392
Let’s go!
Straight to the drill site.

1:37:35.475 --> 1:37:36.643
Go, go, go, go!

1:37:49.698 --> 1:37:51.032
Wellhead team, let’s go!
You’re up!

1:38:17.058 --> 1:38:19.019
Got it!

1:38:19.102 --> 1:38:21.563
Wellhead is tapped
and sprung.

1:38:21.646 --> 1:38:24.274
All right, blasting team,
Tunnel 6 on the double!

1:38:40.624 --> 1:38:42.334
Young lady,
you’re in no condition--

1:38:42.417 --> 1:38:44.085
I don’t give a shit.
Put a Band-Aid on it.

1:38:44.169 --> 1:38:45.795
I heard blasting,
I’m going to find Cody.

1:38:45.879 --> 1:38:47.297
-Tantoo.
-What?

1:38:47.380 --> 1:38:49.424
We’re outside
the oxygen window.

1:38:49.507 --> 1:38:50.925
We didn’t make it
in time.

1:38:51.009 --> 1:38:53.428
Don’t say that.

1:38:53.511 --> 1:38:55.805
Look, Gurty died so that
the miners would live, okay?

1:38:55.889 --> 1:38:58.683
My brother is alive.
I’m going to find him. Let’s go.

1:39:09.986 --> 1:39:11.655
Someone’s coming out!

1:39:36.513 --> 1:39:37.972
Cody?

1:39:46.981 --> 1:39:47.982
Cody?

1:39:48.733 --> 1:39:50.276
Oh, my God!

1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:52.904
Cody. You’re alive.

1:39:52.987 --> 1:39:55.407
-Oh, my God.
- You saved my life.

1:39:58.410 --> 1:40:00.036
I had help.

1:40:01.705 --> 1:40:02.706
Thank you.

1:40:23.393 --> 1:40:24.644
You paid them?

1:40:27.063 --> 1:40:30.275
You paid them to shut off
their sensors?

1:40:36.448 --> 1:40:38.032
You’re disgusting.

1:41:02.432 --> 1:41:04.184
Mr. McCann?

1:41:04.267 --> 1:41:07.187
I’m Deputy Minister
of Natural Resources for Canada.

1:41:07.270 --> 1:41:08.688
I want to thank you,

1:41:08.772 --> 1:41:11.357
and offer condolences
for your brother.

1:41:11.441 --> 1:41:13.485
The company has some papers
for you to sign.

1:41:13.568 --> 1:41:14.944
We have a check for you,

1:41:15.028 --> 1:41:16.988
and the police
need your statement.

1:41:21.618 --> 1:41:23.870
Excuse me, Mr. McCann?

1:41:23.953 --> 1:41:26.289
We found this
with your brother’s things.

1:41:38.510 --> 1:41:39.803
Thank you.

1:42:14.671 --> 1:42:16.422
-Hey!
-Hey.

1:42:18.716 --> 1:42:20.051
Brand-new Kenworth, huh?

1:42:20.134 --> 1:42:21.302
Yup.

1:42:21.386 --> 1:42:22.470
It’s a good color.

1:42:22.554 --> 1:42:24.389
In honor of Jim.

1:42:24.472 --> 1:42:26.099
What you hauling?

1:42:26.182 --> 1:42:27.225
Sporting goods.

1:42:27.308 --> 1:42:29.269
Oh. Ain’t that the life.

1:42:29.352 --> 1:42:32.730
Yup. No bosses,
no punching time clocks.

1:42:32.814 --> 1:42:34.399
-Good pay rates.
-Yeah.

1:42:34.482 --> 1:42:37.277
Well, you find yourself
pining for the ice road,

1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:38.611
you know where to find me.

1:42:38.695 --> 1:42:40.029
Deal.

1:42:43.658 --> 1:42:44.701
Thank you, Mike.

1:44:02.946 --> 1:44:05.657
And a blacktop

1:44:14.958 --> 1:44:18.169
We got tough

1:44:18.252 --> 1:44:22.090
Running through our veins

1:44:22.173 --> 1:44:24.842
We’ll find a way

1:44:24.926 --> 1:44:27.929
Never say die

1:44:28.012 --> 1:44:31.766
You’re doggone right

1:44:31.849 --> 1:44:37.188
We’ll come back every time

1:45:05.633 --> 1:45:10.930
To our last names

1:45:14.183 --> 1:45:17.353
We got tough

1:45:17.437 --> 1:45:21.441
Running through our veins

1:45:21.524 --> 1:45:24.277
We’ll find a way

1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:27.071
Never say die

1:45:27.155 --> 1:45:30.992
Yeah, you’re doggone right

1:45:31.075 --> 1:45:37.457
We’ll come back every time

1:45:39.542 --> 1:45:43.880
Every time

1:45:45.965 --> 1:45:51.888
Every time

1:46:24.712 --> 1:46:29.133
And the ashes
