Next touchdown wins,
we got the ball,
so you man up.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.772
I'm a little banged up here.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.607
You know why you got
25 years?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.276
Yeah, because I refused
to testify

01:15.409 --> 01:17.111
against anybody
whose last name ended
in a vowel.

01:17.245 --> 01:20.814
No, you got 25 years
because you're a quitter.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.317
When things get tough,
you look for shortcuts.
You quit.

01:23.451 --> 01:26.187
You quit on your family,
you quit on your friends,

01:26.320 --> 01:27.755
you quit on God.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.858
And that's because
you ain't got no heart.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.460
Yeah, that's right,
I called you a quitter.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.728
What you gonna do about it?

If that don't sit well
with you,
prove me wrong.

for once in your life,
don't take a shortcut.

Take the pain and help
this team win.

01:51.345 --> 01:57.518
Well, you know, I think
we're all born
with certain genes.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.320
I think
Barry was missing one.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.589
It's got to be something
deep-seated in Barry.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.792
Barry did what he did.
I mean, nobody really
put him up to it.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.760
Barry could convince
anybody of anything,

02:06.894 --> 02:08.696
and he was very,
very good at it.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.431
From the moment
he shook my hand...

02:10.564 --> 02:11.932
He's a sociopath.

02:12.065 --> 02:15.503
I thought this was
the entrepreneur of the year.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.306
He was almost incapable
of not lying.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.241
And, you know,
I give him credit for this

02:20.374 --> 02:22.410
tremendous scam
that he pulled at that time.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.744
He had so much charisma...

02:23.877 --> 02:25.913
I've never seen anybody
like Barry.

02:26.046 --> 02:29.116
...that you
believed everything.
Everything.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.918
He could sell ice to Eskimos.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.954
Barry reinvented himself.

02:34.087 --> 02:38.091
You know, for a young guy,
it was pretty amazing
what he pulled off.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.494
JERRI: He didn't want
his lights turned off.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.031

a half a dozen gym fans.

Good thing it gets hot
in the Valley, huh?

03:04.318 --> 03:05.886
That's pretty good, right?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.391
Let me give you
some advice, kiddo.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.262
Never work for somebody else
if you can help it.

some real money.

You can't do this to me.
I haven't done anything wrong.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.426
Barry. Sit down.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.269
We didn't realize
that you were underage.

it's a legally
binding document.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.376
It's a contract.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.412
And you cannot sign
a legally binding

I'm not one

you've accomplished,
believe me.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.103
But this is the way
the system works.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.472

but to close
your account immediately

12:52.605 --> 12:54.842

all outstanding checks.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.378
You said you were
impressed by me. Right?

13:02.015 --> 13:04.952

an exception for me?

13:05.085 --> 13:06.019
I'm sorry, kid.

I wish it didn't have
to be this way.

Mr. Fitzgerald,
I've been to every bank
n the area

16:29.289 --> 16:31.591
and no one will open
a business
checking account for me

16:31.724 --> 16:32.992
because they say
I'm too young.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.961
Funny thing is,
I already had one open

16:35.095 --> 16:37.730
for over half a year
before anyone ever
found out my age.

16:37.864 --> 16:41.668
I would have thought
that I had proven my ability
to be responsible.

16:41.801 --> 16:46.206
You don't impress me
as being too young.
You seem pretty mature.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.341
I get that all the time.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.143
Look, Mr. Fitzgerald,

16:51.311 --> 16:53.012
I've started a good business.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.547
And I know
what I'm capable of.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.982
I mean, I already have
seven employees,

16:56.116 --> 16:58.585

on their wages.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.353

17:00.487 --> 17:01.721

to take a small risk

17:06.759 --> 17:08.261

17:13.433 --> 17:15.402
Fine. I'll take the chance.

when I started 35 years ago.

25:58.557 --> 26:03.095
You know,
all the carpet companies
out there...

26:03.229 --> 26:05.064
All your competitors,
they all advertise

26:05.197 --> 26:07.266
for one big thing
that you don't.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.869
Emergency water damage
restoration.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.373
Water heater
busts in the house,

26:14.506 --> 26:16.408
water floods
the carpets everywhere.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.077
The first people called
are the carpet cleaners

26:18.210 --> 26:19.979
who come in
and extract the water.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.482
Bingo! And you make millions.

26:25.251 --> 26:30.189
If you're ever interested
in that kinda thing,
just let me know.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.258
I'll help you
find some work.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.778
Are you insane?

26:52.745 --> 26:54.681
You can't open
another office.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.649
Barry, you think that
I don't know that you're
kiting checks again?

26:56.783 --> 26:58.951
This company is hanging on
by a thread.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.687
Relax.
And we both know...

27:00.820 --> 27:03.690
Relax! Okay?
Everybody cheats a little bit.
It's not a big deal.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.057
It's a big deal.
It is a big deal.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.959
It's not.
It's not a big deal!

27:07.093 --> 27:10.396
Okay? I had to expand
to generate more cash
to catch up on my...

27:10.529 --> 27:13.199
Barry, you can't run
one office on...
Do not...

27:13.332 --> 27:17.036
Do not raise your...
Barry!

27:17.169 --> 27:19.872
Do not raise
your voice at me.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.814
It's settled. All right?

27:30.683 --> 27:32.819
I already got the location
picked out.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.993
Look, everybody thinks
I'm some kind of
hotshot now, man.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.932
Barry Minkow,
the young entrepreneur.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.936
I gotta keep that going.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.671
Mike, it's who I am now.

28:15.327 --> 28:20.166
With the debts
and the divorce, I really need
the extra income.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.001
Great. Happy to help.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.471
Now, I need you to
mock up a few documents

28:25.604 --> 28:28.941
for a bloated
insurance company.
So, don't feel bad.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.577
Feeling bad was
not something
I was factoring in.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.815
You do have the cash, right?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.295
You're sure this was
one of your competitors?

29:23.429 --> 29:24.496
Yeah.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.731
What did they steal?

29:25.865 --> 29:28.500
Four Crowell Triple Vac
steam cleaners.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.669
Yeah, but Barry,
even at 1,500 a piece,

29:30.803 --> 29:32.038
that doesn't equal $12,000.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.139
Water damage.

29:34.073 --> 29:35.207
"Water damage"?

29:35.341 --> 29:36.775
Yeah.

29:36.909 --> 29:39.511
See, when they broke in,
they set off the sprinklers,

29:39.645 --> 29:40.880
which caused water damage.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.382
These guys are trying to
put me out of business!

29:43.515 --> 29:45.384
But we fixed it.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.453
Because that's what we do.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.722
It's expensive.
Really?

29:50.857 --> 29:53.092
Yeah, it's called
"restoration work."

29:53.225 --> 29:54.827
In fact, ZZZZ Best is going to

29:54.961 --> 29:56.162
be awarded out
more restoration jobs

29:56.295 --> 29:57.429
from other big companies

29:57.563 --> 29:59.866
as early as next week
and that...

29:59.999 --> 30:01.968
That's where the real
growth opportunities are

30:02.101 --> 30:03.769
in the carpet-cleaning
industry.

30:15.447 --> 30:19.251
I think a little toast
is in order for the man
of the hour.

30:19.385 --> 30:22.021
Dad, come on.
No, no, no.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.524
Here's to Barry
on your 18th birthday.

30:25.657 --> 30:30.496
You're an adult,
well, legally anyway.

30:30.629 --> 30:33.765
Now, you can get married,
even join the army

30:33.900 --> 30:36.135
with or without
our permission.
To my son, Barry...

30:36.268 --> 30:37.904
I am sorry to interrupt,

30:38.037 --> 30:41.073
but you know how it is
when your father tries
to be funny.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.042
Right...

30:43.175 --> 30:47.146
But I would like to
say something.
I'd like to toast you, Barry.

30:49.648 --> 30:55.054
I am so proud
of your success.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.824
Thank you, Mom.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.130
Cheers.
To ZZZZ Best, son.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.932
Cheers, guys.
Mazel tov.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.507
WOMAN: And so,
as we look forward

31:15.641 --> 31:17.543
to the excitement
of new lives,

31:17.676 --> 31:19.211
we, the fresh-faced class...

31:19.345 --> 31:21.613
MIKEY: Man, I feel like
I don't even know you anymore.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.517
Come on.
Yeah you do, Mikey.

31:25.651 --> 31:30.122
Same old Barry. I'm just
a regular business now,
that's all.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.525
But like Icarus,
who flew too high to the sun,

31:33.659 --> 31:35.527
we need to keep watch,

31:35.661 --> 31:38.564
to keep level and not
let the temptations
of our new freedom

31:38.697 --> 31:40.432
be the end of us.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.701
Come on.

31:42.834 --> 31:43.970
Who doesn't cheat
on their taxes

31:44.103 --> 31:45.437
or inflate
an insurance claim?

31:45.571 --> 31:47.974
Can we just enjoy graduation?

31:48.107 --> 31:51.443
I applaud you fellow students
on this day of rebirth...

31:51.577 --> 31:53.479
The answer is, everyone.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.081
And nobody gets hurt,
all right?

31:55.214 --> 31:58.050
So, don't come at me
with that
self-righteous attitude.

31:58.184 --> 32:02.288
In fact, I think I deserve
a little thanks.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.458
Really. You're running
flush now because of me.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.561
Congratulations to
the class of 1984!

32:09.695 --> 32:11.998
(ALL CHEERING)

32:35.421 --> 32:36.788
Damn it.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.906
JOE: Hey,
it's your favorite uncle.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.241
BARRY: Hey, Uncle Joe.
How are you?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.277
JOE: I'm good, kid. Listen.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.046
I'm out there
in the business community
and I'm hearing things.

33:34.180 --> 33:37.183
Like you're expanding too fast
and you can't possibly
be profitable.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.551
BARRY: Uncle Joe,
that's just jealous people

33:39.685 --> 33:42.054
using their stories
as an excuse
for their mediocrity.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.823
Yeah, yeah.
I'm hearing that, too.
See?

33:44.956 --> 33:46.925
JOE: Okay. All right.
But be careful.

33:47.059 --> 33:50.162
You have to be a little bit
of a thief in business,
I know that.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.631
But you don't want
to become a thief.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.901
Then you're not
in business anymore,
you're just a crook.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.007
There's a project
over in Tarzana

34:02.141 --> 34:04.076
and I have
an interested buyer.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.345
He won't close on the sale
until I fix a rip
in the carpet.

34:06.478 --> 34:07.646
BARRY: I'll get someone
right on it.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.315
JOE: No, no. He wants you.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.150
He wants to meet
the millionaire kid
success story.

34:12.284 --> 34:15.754
Just be careful. I hear
this guy's connected.
A real Mafioso.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.123
I mean it.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.860
I read about you
in the Examiner,
didn't I?

34:24.663 --> 34:25.931
Yeah, yeah.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.333
Joe says you're a pro.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.835
That's my Uncle Joe.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.005
How do you do that, Barry?

34:35.940 --> 34:39.077
Pull down a profit like that?

34:39.210 --> 34:40.779
Cleaning carpet?

34:42.348 --> 34:43.748
I never heard of that.

34:45.484 --> 34:49.855
Well, Jack, the real money,
it's not
in the carpet cleaning.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.090
It's in these things
called restoration jobs.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.391
Oh, yeah?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.428
Like cleaning up
after an old fire?

34:56.562 --> 34:58.063
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

34:58.197 --> 35:01.300
Um, the jobs,
they come in through...

35:01.433 --> 35:03.001
Through these
insurance adjusters.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.171
My company, ZZZZ Best,
we got, like...

35:05.304 --> 35:07.406
We got three of these jobs
lined up right now.

35:07.539 --> 35:08.940
But I plan on expanding,

35:09.074 --> 35:13.579
because each job contract
is worth about 25 grand.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.381
That must be nice.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.783
BARRY: Yeah, yeah.
It's really nice.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.117
You know, you have
these huge buildings

35:19.251 --> 35:21.753
with these complex
sprinkler systems

35:21.887 --> 35:25.023
and they go off inadvertently,
causing floods.

35:25.157 --> 35:27.393
You know,
and it's expensive to fix.

35:29.328 --> 35:32.631
If I had the money,
there's no limit
to what I could do.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.100
How much?
A hundred grand.

35:37.068 --> 35:40.005
A hundred grand?
Just for clean-up?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.907
No, no.
It's much more than that.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.377
It's extracting the water,
dehumidifying the area,

35:45.511 --> 35:47.313
you know,
padding and tack strips,
mold treatment.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.881
You see,
all this requires money,
lots of money,

35:50.015 --> 35:51.917
and these worthless
insurance companies,

35:52.050 --> 35:54.486
they're notoriously slow
for these large payouts.

35:54.620 --> 35:58.023
And see, that's what
sets me apart
from my competition.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.492
Look, Jack,
how many carpet cleaners

36:00.626 --> 36:03.061
do you know in this business
that are well-capitalized?

36:03.195 --> 36:06.632
How much are you
gonna pull down right now?

36:06.765 --> 36:08.767
With these restorations?

36:08.900 --> 36:12.204
These three?
Eighty grand. Profit.

36:13.939 --> 36:17.309
It's good. So give me proof.

36:17.443 --> 36:18.410
Proof?

36:18.544 --> 36:19.545
Yeah, proof of
the jobs, huh?

36:19.678 --> 36:21.079
A little accountability.
You know?

36:21.213 --> 36:23.615
I mean,
I'll come in right now.
Fifty grand cash.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.951
You need money,
I'll raise money, you know.

36:26.084 --> 36:29.755
I'll talk to friends.
It's all numbers, Barry.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.156
"Numbers"?
It's just numbers.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.660
Yeah, yeah, numbers.
It's all numbers.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.296
We come in,

36:37.429 --> 36:40.732
we come in for a lot more
than a hundred, you know.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.133
A lot more.

36:44.002 --> 36:47.205
We split profit,
you know? 50/50.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.008
"50/50"?

36:51.243 --> 36:55.213
All the jobs.
If you're interested.

36:58.216 --> 37:02.521
Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, of course,
I'm interested.

37:08.360 --> 37:12.998
The proof, the documents,
I can bring those by tomorrow.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.435
You want a drink?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.971
Nah, I don't drink.

37:21.139 --> 37:24.410
Good for you.
You're a smart kid.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.084
This is unacceptable.

37:33.218 --> 37:34.920
You don't understand.
No, no, you don't understand.

37:35.053 --> 37:38.357
You got those
credit card accounts
because I vouched for you!

37:38.490 --> 37:40.726
Twenty-five thousand
in fraudulent accounts!

37:40.859 --> 37:42.528
Look it wasn't me! I swear!

37:42.661 --> 37:43.729
Barry.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.597
It was crooked
carpet cleaners! Look...

37:45.731 --> 37:48.367
They want me
out of business...
Keep it down.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.201
Look, they faked
the credit card slips

37:50.336 --> 37:52.638
so they could double-bill
the customers
and make more money.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.272
What do you want me to do?

37:54.406 --> 37:56.107
I just found out
about this last night.
I already fired them.

37:56.241 --> 37:57.743
Were you planning
on telling me?

37:57.876 --> 37:59.911
Yes... I guess...
You guess?

38:00.045 --> 38:03.482
Yes, yes, yes.
Of course I was planning on...

38:03.615 --> 38:07.152
Look, I'm a little
over my head here, Bill.

38:07.285 --> 38:11.423
Mr. Fitzgerald, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.894
All right.

38:18.897 --> 38:21.967
I can keep your accounts open
for five business days.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.069
You deposit $10,000
at that time

38:24.202 --> 38:26.071
and the rest five days
after that...

38:26.204 --> 38:27.305
I won't let you down.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.974
You better meet
these deadlines, Barry.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.476
Otherwise, I will
shut you down

38:30.609 --> 38:32.444
and I will bounce
all your checks.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.383
This is a joke to you, huh?

38:41.219 --> 38:42.421
That would put me
out of business.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.590
I know.
So it should motivate you.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.191
Now, get the hell out of here.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.536
Hey, I need your help.

38:59.371 --> 39:02.874
Look, we need to find
a way to fake some
nonexistent restoration jobs.

39:03.008 --> 39:06.945
All right? I'm not
talking about staging
a phony break-in.

39:07.078 --> 39:12.718
I'm talking about hundreds
of thousands of dollars
in jobs that don't exist.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.252
Got any ideas?

39:14.386 --> 39:17.022
I can incorporate
a phony adjusting firm.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.126
A phony adjusting firm.

39:23.495 --> 39:26.932
So, what, it would fake
the jobs
on the firm's letterhead?

39:27.065 --> 39:28.333
Yeah.

39:29.968 --> 39:33.138
That's great.
That's great! Okay.

39:33.271 --> 39:35.073
And in the meantime,
I'll work hard

39:35.206 --> 39:38.610
trying to get ZZZZ Best
some legitimate claims
to cover your back.

39:38.744 --> 39:41.046
I'll catch you
in your office later.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.982
Okay, okay. Thank you.

39:44.115 --> 39:47.085
I really appreciate this.
I wouldn't ask you if
it wasn't life or death.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.655
I got 100 employees
depending on me.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.056
Well, they're your problem.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.158
I'm just doing this
for money, is all.

39:53.291 --> 39:54.560
As long as you do it.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.501

Can I trust him?
Absolutely.

40:22.488 --> 40:25.256
So, let me explain to you
how a restoration job works.

40:25.390 --> 40:26.825
All right, gorgeous woman.

Huh?

Did they come see you yet?

Who?
The FBI.

The FBI... No.
No?

No.

41:00.425 --> 41:06.164
Well... They might,
you know.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.166
They'll probably pay you
a visit.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.537
Ask questions about me.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.306
Well, if they do,
just say nothing more

you know?

41:19.244 --> 41:20.311
"Our arrangement"?

41:20.445 --> 41:22.313
Yeah, it's legitimate.

41:24.282 --> 41:26.151
You could prove that.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.155
Can't you?
Yeah, yeah.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.758
Of course.
Of course I can prove it.

Hi.

I got a present
for you inside. Okay?

Okay.

Yes. Jack Saxon.

I understand he's been
shaking you down

that he made you...

43:00.245 --> 43:02.047
He hasn't given me a loan,
he's a business consultant.

to testify in a grand jury

about your business deals
with this Saxon.

43:19.665 --> 43:21.767
With all due respect,
why would I testify
against him?

He's been nothing
but a help to my company.

I was cocky. Barry was cocky.

Everything we did
just seemed to fall
nto place.

It was almost like we were
beinglooked over by some
guardian angel.

more people
that didn't believe Barry

43:53.398 --> 43:55.233
than the ones that did.

43:55.366 --> 43:56.968
But he only needed a couple.

43:57.102 --> 43:59.270
HALL: Altogether,
I think the FBI said

43:59.404 --> 44:02.674
I created about 23,000
false documents

44:02.808 --> 44:05.744
to convince Wall Street,
NASDAQ and the SEC

44:05.877 --> 44:09.580
that we were doing about
$400 million
worth of restoration work

44:09.715 --> 44:12.150
when in reality,
we were doing none.

44:12.283 --> 44:13.584
JERRI: Barry was working with

44:13.719 --> 44:15.486

of Payne Cameron

44:15.620 --> 44:17.422
to take ZZZZ Best public.

44:17.555 --> 44:22.560
However, Barry and Jack Saxon
had a side scheme
to pump and dump,

44:22.694 --> 44:24.996
acquiring ZZZZ Best stock
at five cents apiece,

44:25.130 --> 44:29.367
selling at the market price
and violating securities laws.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.738
HALL: The biggest scam
we pulled off
was the Sacramento job.

44:32.871 --> 44:36.207
Barry staged a walkthrough
of a newly-restored
office building

44:36.341 --> 44:37.976
to fool
the Wall Street auditors

44:38.109 --> 44:39.544
into believing that ZZZZ Best

44:39.677 --> 44:41.546
had done
all of the restoration work.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.115
We hadn't done
any of that work.

44:44.249 --> 44:47.285

a hundred bucks
to make it look good.

who was here last.

Doesn't even look like
there was
any water damage at all.

45:14.780 --> 45:16.848
Well, that's the point.

45:16.982 --> 45:20.018

take your money.
You give it to him.

with a smile.

auditors signed off
on our financials,

45:42.974 --> 45:46.211
Payne Cameron
took ZZZZ Best public.

45:46.344 --> 45:52.217
By the end of the day,
we had a market cap
of well over $300 million.

45:52.350 --> 45:55.153
Truth be told,
we were worth almost nothing.

it's a bit more
than impressive...

Come on, you've been praying
for this your whole life,
haven't you?

50:08.239 --> 50:15.413
Yeah, I was praying for this
but I was praying
to my vanity.

50:16.647 --> 50:18.316
Please listen. I wanted...

I wanted so much more
than what your father
could provide.

50:20.985 --> 50:22.887
I didn't realize
what a good man he was.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.990
"A good man." A good man
pays the water bill.

50:26.124 --> 50:27.758
A good man keeps
the lights on in the house.

50:27.892 --> 50:30.928
A good man will take care of
and provide for his family

50:31.062 --> 50:34.165
no matter what the cost. I...
Mom... Mama... I'm a good man.

50:34.299 --> 50:37.168
It's very hard to be
a good man, Barry.

50:37.302 --> 50:41.872
You're really doing this to me
on my birthday, Mom?

50:42.006 --> 50:45.243
What are you doing?
You want to turn on
all this now?

50:45.376 --> 50:49.347
I am the most successful thing
to ever come from this family.

50:51.449 --> 50:52.883
All right? This is everything
that you've wanted.

50:53.017 --> 50:54.719

I couldn't even think of
anythingto wish for,
because I already have...

You don't have anything.

51:07.332 --> 51:10.301
You don't have anything,
because you don't
have morality!

four points today?

Absolutely. See, that was
a reaction
to the LA Times story

any such investigation.

filed a permit
for such construction.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.304
You helped a weaker brother
who was outnumbered.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:19.409
Shows that you're changing
from your selfish-ass,
self-centered ways.

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:23.780
Remember. The Lord always
looks out for the underdog.

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:29.286
BARRY: I don't know
if it was Peanut
or the broken nose.

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:33.057
I guess God has a way
of taking care of the details.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:39.896
And it was at this moment
that life took on new clarity
for me.

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.699
See, to win the game,
I had to stay in the pocket,

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.001
and face the pain.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:48.705
It was then I learned
that to win in life

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:51.741
meant no more backing down.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:54.711
No more shortcuts.

01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:57.847
No more compromises.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.384
No more lies.

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:05.889
And no more cons.

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:18.868
(INMATES CLAPPING)

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:25.409
(INMATES CHEERING)

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:38.488
How you feeling?

01:07:38.622 --> 01:07:42.426
DAN: I question whether
some of the stuff he did
was for the movie

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.060
or the story of the movie.

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:46.496
I never felt better.
Thank you.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.299
DAN: I question whether
Peanut was a real person
or not.

01:07:49.433 --> 01:07:51.401
It's a pretty good throw.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:54.771
MIKEY: I don't think
Barry could throw
a football nine feet.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:57.141
Truth plus time equal trust.

01:07:57.274 --> 01:08:01.945
A lot of truth, over a long
period of time equals trust.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.948
And no shortcuts
to that equation either,
you know?

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:19.328
Yeah, well,
thanks for the time.

01:08:24.268 --> 01:08:26.536
BARRY: Like I said
from the beginning,

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:29.639
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life
in witness protection.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:34.344
I'm not going to testify
against Mr. Saxon,
not now, not ever.

01:08:34.478 --> 01:08:36.145
Excuse me.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.814
JERRI: I never felt
that Barry
was rehabilitated.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.352
FRANZESE: I believe
his transformation
was real.

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:47.256
MIKEY: Everyone in prison knew
that if you found Jesus

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:51.795
that would look good
on your record
to maybe get early release.

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:54.096
BARRY: (ON TAPE)
Truth plus time equal trust.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:58.968
A lot of truth,
over a long period of time
equals trust.

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:01.738
And no shortcuts
to that equation either,
you know.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:09.279
All right. We've heard
the testimony.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:14.149
Now, it's time to decide
based on Mr. Minkow's
present character.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:31.435
FRANZESE: You know, he came
out of prison raring to go.

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:35.205
But I didn't see it coming
with the church,
quite honestly.

01:09:35.339 --> 01:09:40.577
Mr. Minkow, we have
gone through your application

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:43.046
and enjoyed your guest sermon,

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:48.685
but now we'd like
to hear the answer
to the following question.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.554
Why should we hire you?

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:56.025
Well, on paper,
you shouldn't.

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:58.362
Especially when you
consider the fact that

01:09:58.495 --> 01:10:01.865
the other 199 applicants
aren't convicted felons.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:09.839
If you hire me,
I can promise you one thing,

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:12.576
that no one will work harder,
if for no other reason

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:16.480
than out of gratitude
for being given
the opportunity

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:18.815
to pastor such a great church.

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:24.454
You see, I'm naive enough
to believe that

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:28.057
if you want to find
the best employee,
the best place to find one

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:30.527
is someone who's
just come out of prison,

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.296
who didn't fail jail.

01:10:33.497 --> 01:10:36.433
Who owes society
for what they've...

01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:40.437
I've done.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:46.410
And what better way
for a church to show their
belief in the gospel of grace

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:51.214
than have a broken vessel
like me proclaim that truth

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:53.583
from the pulpit
of this very church.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:57.921
And from
a marketing standpoint,
imagine a slogan,

01:10:58.054 --> 01:10:59.623
"Community Bible Church,

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:03.627
the only church
where the pastor
is far worse than you."

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:09.966
FRANZESE: I'll tell ya,
I don't know if you ever
saw him in church,

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.936
in front of his congregation,
he was masterful.

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:15.605
I mean, he had them
in the palm of his hands.

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:18.041
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:20.610
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:22.145
Hi.
Hi.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.748
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:28.952
First time here?
Yes. Wonderful sermon,
Pastor Minkow.

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:31.721
Pastor Barry, please.
And this is my wife Lisa.

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:33.156
Hi, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.892
Hi, I'm Ellen Scott
and this is my husband Don.

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:37.527
Don, it's good to meet you.

01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:39.863
We drove down
from Santa Barbara.
Santa Barbara?

01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:43.132
Well, my sermons don't merit
that kind of sacrifice,
but thank you anyway.

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:46.135
We're here
for another reason.

01:11:48.372 --> 01:11:53.877
The past 10 years, we put
all our retirement savings
in a hedge fund.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:57.046
About $250,000.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:00.550
I earned that money,
working 31 years
as a longshoreman.

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:07.156
Now we're worried about
the fund and thought you
could check it out.

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:08.892
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
I'm a pastor.

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:11.528
I don't really know
a whole lot
about hedge funds.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:16.332
I'm really sorry. I...
Look, why are you concerned?

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:19.035
The manager
just moved his office
to the Bahamas.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.870
How long
have they been around?

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:25.675
Twenty years. They're
worth around $800 million,
about 2,000 investors.

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.844
Twenty years, $800 million...

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:30.013
Sounds like you don't have
a whole lot to worry
about there.

01:12:30.146 --> 01:12:34.851
Please, would you check on it?
I brought the prospectus.

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:37.320
Why me? I'm not an expert
in these kind of things.

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:41.525
Everything was fine
until I tried to withdraw
the money.

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:46.496
They've been telling me
that it's in process
for three months.

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:51.334
I told my nephew about it
and he suggested I see you.

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:55.338
Your nephew.
Who's your nephew?

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.079
Mike?

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:07.050
Mike? Is that you?

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:11.555
You look great.
You look great.

01:13:11.688 --> 01:13:13.590
Not even you can
pull off that lie.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:17.393
Well, I'm not exactly
winning any beauty
contests myself.

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:19.095
How you been?

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.831
I'll be a lot better
if you tell me you can
help out my uncle.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.366
Yeah, well...

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.203
This hedge-fund guy, Lewis,
right, he's telling me

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:30.674
he's getting monthly gains
of 1.5% to 3.5%.

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:34.711
Yeah, I don't think anybody's
quite that good.

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:36.212
Hedge fund, I...

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:37.981
You know, I got that letter
you wrote to me from prison,

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:39.949
apologizing for what you did.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:43.319
Were you lying then
or are you lying now?

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:47.390
Look, Mike, I'm not
the same guy I was before.

01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:50.794
I'm married.
I got the church.
I got twins.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.830
I teach the FBI
in fraud prevention
in Quantico. I...

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:57.567
I don't really want to hear
about the good deeds
of my old schoolmates.

01:13:57.701 --> 01:13:59.603
You can tell me you're working
with lepers on an island,

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:03.072
my opinion of you
wouldn't change, Barry. Okay?

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:06.042
I'll believe the change
when I see it.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:09.713
Anybody who's ever been
in a financial dealing with me
has lived to regret it.

01:14:09.846 --> 01:14:11.280
You know that.

01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:14.050
Yeah, I'll take my chances.

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.986
Besides, your rates
are unbeatable.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.888
(CHUCKLES)

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:22.391
Rates?
I don't have any rates.

01:14:22.526 --> 01:14:23.627
Exactly.

01:14:26.663 --> 01:14:30.834
MIKEY: It became just too much
of a temptation for him.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:34.103
JERRI: Barry wanted
to kind of do
the Catch Me If You Can.

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:37.641
DAN: It was impressive.
I mean, he really
knew his stuff.

01:14:37.774 --> 01:14:39.543
And there you have
the six red flags for fraud.

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:42.178
Should you choose to
commit those to memory,

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:43.713
you will be able to stop
the next Barry Minkow

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:45.749
before he is the next
Barry Minkow.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:47.717
That's all I have today.
Thanks for joining me.

01:14:49.853 --> 01:14:54.390
DAN: I think Barry viewed
himself as a hero
in a sort of twisted way.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.995
Well, well, well.

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:00.697
If it ain't the preacher man.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.366
Good to see you, Smooth.
I see the streets
have treated you well.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:04.534
You look good, my friend.

01:15:04.668 --> 01:15:06.269
Yeah, right.

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:09.038
You get a chance
to look at the copy
of the prospectus I sent you?

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:12.275
Does your PO officer know
that you're associating
with an ex-con?

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:14.010
'Cause I will tell him.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:17.180
I'm just trying
to figure out how this
Lewis guy has managed to

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:20.784
run a Ponzi scheme
for 20 years
without it imploding.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:24.621
Either I'm missing something,
or he's a financial genius.

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:26.355
Little of both.

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:31.260
Can I get a beer
and a whiskey, please?

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.868
Look, I need your expertise.

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:41.137
You're the best there is.

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:44.173
(SIGHS)

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.278
You already got
what you're looking for.

01:15:53.817 --> 01:15:55.685
In the prospectus.

01:15:55.819 --> 01:16:00.056
They practically advertise
for people to invest
their retirement money.

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:02.125
Yeah, so?

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:05.995
When people take their
IRA money and put it into
a fund like this one here,

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:09.933
there are heavy penalties
if you pull out before
you're 57 and a half.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:14.470
They can invest the money
all they want,
they just can't pull it out.

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:18.608
The perfect ingredient
for the successful
Ponzi scheme.

01:16:18.742 --> 01:16:19.508
(CHUCKLES)

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:24.848
JERRI: Barry becoming
a fraud buster
didn't surprise me.

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:29.052
You know, I always wondered
if going undercover was
an opportunity for him

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:33.690
to reenact his favorite
'80s detective shows,
and he had many,

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:38.394
or was it part
of a larger plan to actually
do good this time?

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:47.236
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:50.674
Let me explain this to you.
There's just
a slight difference

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:53.209
between lecturing these guys
and dodging bullets for them.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:56.512
And it's not like you've been
trained exactly.
Not to a fine edge.

01:16:56.646 --> 01:17:00.249
Look, the guy has been
around for over 20 years
and he's a ghost.

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:01.718
No license
to sell securities,

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:03.386
no assets held
in the fund's name, nothing.

01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:05.088
Who the hell is this guy?

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:07.123
It's the only way.

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:10.626
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll send Matt
down to the Bahamas,

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.528
and he'll record
the meeting.

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:15.665
If there's any misreps,
we'll move forward from there.

01:17:15.799 --> 01:17:17.000
How's that?

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:19.402
Uh, just one last thing is,

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:22.471
I need Quantico to create me
a bogus bank statement

01:17:22.605 --> 01:17:26.242
showing the church
has $5 million parked
in a money market.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:29.645
Wait a minute, how do you
know this guy's gonna show up
in the first place?

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:33.182
Any Ponzi scheme operator
desperate for new cash

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:37.053
would do whatever it took
to get their hands
on new cash. He'll show.

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:37.854
Uh-huh.

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:42.692
So, you're asking me to give
the carpet guy

01:17:42.826 --> 01:17:47.731
this bank statement
for $5 million.

01:17:47.864 --> 01:17:48.965
What, am I crazy?

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:52.335
Ernest Hemingway said,
"The only way you can learn

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:55.571
"to trust someone,
is to trust 'em."

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:57.373
Ernest Hemingway said that?

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:01.544
I think so.
Could have been Churchill.
Or him.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.279
MIKEY: "Barry,
you don't understand.

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.248
"You're going undercover,
you're not a cop.

01:18:05.381 --> 01:18:06.983
"You're a pastor."

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:09.218
He said, "Listen,
I'm uncovering fraud.

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:14.657
"I'm helping people
that are getting scammed
and victimized by others."

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:17.560
I said, "Barry,
working so closely
with the government,

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:20.797
"if you're wrong one time,
you're in trouble."

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.199
You say Don Scott's
a friend of yours?

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:25.268
Yeah, he's a member
of our church,

01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:27.837
and the church has been
growing so much lately

01:18:27.971 --> 01:18:30.106
that we've established
a building fund,

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:33.142
to purchase some land
to accommodate the growth.

01:18:33.276 --> 01:18:36.312
We wanted to invest
that money, have it working
for us until we build.

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:39.883
Well, it would grow here,
I assure you. How much
do you have to invest?

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:42.451
A little over $5 million.

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:46.455
Those returns that
you've been generating,
can they be corroborated?

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:50.693
Yes. We earn
18% to 40% annual.
A 20-year track record.

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:53.396
And 800 million?
Eight hundred million.
Yes, correct.

01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:55.631
$800 million fund.

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:58.401
You just gotta forgive me.
Numbers like that get me
a little bit nervous.

01:18:58.534 --> 01:19:01.938
You are aware of my past,
I was convicted
of securities fraud?

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.739
I read about you, yes.

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:07.143
I like how you disclose it
up-front on your church's
website, too.

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:10.780
I'll be happy
to work with you.
We all make mistakes.

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:13.182
You were just a kid.
You got greedy.

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:17.420
I have
the money market account,
bank statement

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:20.790
to prove that the money is
waiting there,
you can call the bank.

01:19:20.924 --> 01:19:22.792
It's clear funds,
waiting to wire.

01:19:22.926 --> 01:19:25.895
Well, thank you for coming,
Pastor. I look forward
to working with you.

01:19:26.029 --> 01:19:27.663
Well, I do appreciate
you seeing me,

01:19:27.797 --> 01:19:31.901
and just as soon as you
send Don Scott his $250,000,

01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:34.570
we'll wire these funds
right to your bank account.

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:41.444
It's just that, Mr. Scott
had requested
a $250,000 withdrawal,

01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:43.279
and apparently in your move
to the Bahamas...

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:46.415
You tell Mr. Scott,
he'll have his money
in 24 hours.

01:19:46.549 --> 01:19:48.684
Thank you for coming.
Terrific. Mr. Lewis,

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:50.954
thank you so much
for your time.

01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:55.291
Well, hey, Don,
good to see you.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:59.963
Hey, Barry. Well,
Lewis wired me half
my money this morning.

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:02.098
Half?
Yeah.

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:06.970
He said that the custodian
of American Investment
didn't put in my paperwork,

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:09.138
so he sent it
out of his own pocket,

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:13.376
and he said he'd wire me
the other half very soon.

01:20:13.509 --> 01:20:16.212
You know, Don, I may
have underestimated just how

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:18.581
strapped for cash
Mr. Lewis is.

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:24.687
Why would he risk
five million new fresh dollars

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.456
by sending only half
of what he promised
just days ago?

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:28.858
There's only
one answer to that.

01:20:28.992 --> 01:20:30.693
And that is,
he doesn't have
the full amount,

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:34.397
and he is much more
cash-strapped
than I first anticipated.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.365
You're beginning
to worry me, Barry.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:40.603
Look, Don, I don't want you
to worry about a thing.
I got this under control.

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:43.706
Okay? Trust me on this.
It'll be okay.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.674
I'll take care of it.

Pastor Minkow, Derek Lewis.

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:57.520
My understanding was
you were going to deposit
your church money

01:20:57.653 --> 01:21:00.289
two days after Mr. Scott
got his withdrawal fund.

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:04.894
It's my understanding
that Mr. Scott only received
half of his funds.

01:21:05.028 --> 01:21:06.495
Well, there was a problem
with the paperwork.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.597
He'll get the balance
tomorrow or the next day.

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:13.436
Terrific. And once he does,
the church will wire the funds
as I had promised.

I control who gets paid
and when.

run a number on me.

You know something,
Mr. Lewis, you're not as smart
as you think you are.

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.112
I know exactly
what you're doing.

01:21:23.246 --> 01:21:26.182
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:29.352

good people don't go
to heaven,

That's the...
Barry, what is going on?

Excuse me a second.
Just relax for a minute.
Excuse me.

01:21:36.159 --> 01:21:38.827
Just relax for a minute,
would you, Mike? Okay?

01:21:38.962 --> 01:21:40.629
I'm gonna punch you
in the face

01:21:40.763 --> 01:21:42.565

you tell me to relax,
all right?

is suing my uncle
for $10 million,

for fraud
and misrepresentation.

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:50.739
Yeah, I know.
He's doing the same thing
to me and the church.

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:53.242
The cost for the suit
is gonna wipe them out!

what you are doing. Okay?

money back. That's as good
as they're gonna get.

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:00.349
Just walk away.

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:02.085
I can't, Mike.

01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:04.887
There's a lot more at stake
than what you're thinking.

It's gonna be okay.
Just trust me.

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:09.692
Trust you.
Where have I
heard that before?

01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:12.728
Trusting you
ruined my life, Barry.

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:16.565
FRANZESE: Barry's intentions
were always good,
at least according to him.

01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:18.734
But he had a lack
of regard for the law

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.869
and eventually,
that became an issue.

01:22:21.004 --> 01:22:23.539
But Barry was
very hard to say no to.

01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:28.177
You don't have to convince me
your intentions are good,
Barry.

01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:32.148
I know you've been
making restitution,
even from prison.

I owe this community
a lot more than just money,
Michael, you know that.

01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:38.721
Yes, but what you're
asking me to do, I cannot do.

01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:40.589
I might lose my job.

01:22:40.723 --> 01:22:46.195
Look, Michael,
I got Mr. Lewis on tape
saying he has $800 million

01:22:46.329 --> 01:22:49.465
in his accounts at this bank
and if he does,
that's wonderful.

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:52.068
But if he doesn't,
he's in the process
of destroying

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:55.071
the lives
of thousands of people
in this community.

01:22:55.204 --> 01:22:57.506
I need your help.
I can't just...

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.642
We can't just
let that happen.

All I want you to do is
check the balances.

If they're nowhere
near $800 million,

01:23:05.348 --> 01:23:08.551
then just get out
of that chair,
walk over to that window,

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:11.454
look outside
and then I'll know for sure.

01:23:11.587 --> 01:23:16.125
All I need are those balances.
Please, Michael,
I'll leave either way.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.383
I don't trust you, Minkow.

01:27:34.517 --> 01:27:38.053
Hey, I'm here
to work with you.
I'm not a bad guy.

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:39.755
I'm a liar and a sinner
saved by grace.

01:27:39.888 --> 01:27:41.189
Stop it.

01:27:41.324 --> 01:27:43.392
There's a lot of people
involved with this fund.

01:27:43.526 --> 01:27:45.728
Heavy hitters.
It's not just me.

01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:48.263
Listen, if you hurt me,

01:27:48.397 --> 01:27:51.400
this goes to the FBI
and the Journal.

01:27:51.534 --> 01:27:54.437
I don't want to hurt you.
I just need you to back off.

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:10.553
Well, I guess
this won't be going
to the FBI or the Journal.

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:16.825
But tell me,
getting this much cash
at this stage of your deal,

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:18.527
it was a bitch, wasn't it?

01:28:18.661 --> 01:28:21.997
When you're giving
18% to 40% a year,
the interest kills you.

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.399
Do the math.

01:28:23.532 --> 01:28:26.301
Every day keeps you
a little deeper in the hole.

01:28:26.435 --> 01:28:30.439
I did the math and then I did
eight Super Bowls in prison.

01:28:30.573 --> 01:28:32.274
I'm not a criminal.

01:28:32.408 --> 01:28:35.110
My investors
double their money
every three years.

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:38.113
But I had to make
some risky investments

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:39.848
just to raise some money
for the investors

01:28:39.982 --> 01:28:41.584
that didn't use
the trust fund.

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:44.987
Tough game we're in.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:47.823
These hedge funds,
totally unregulated.

01:28:47.956 --> 01:28:49.057
I'll stay afloat.

01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:50.626
I'll get it all back.

01:28:50.759 --> 01:28:54.530
I just need to survive
until one of my deals
pay off big.

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:56.064
And then I'm home free.

01:28:56.198 --> 01:28:58.834
All I need you to do
is be quiet.

01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:02.771
So, no money
left in the fund?

01:29:02.905 --> 01:29:04.373
More or less.

01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:11.814
Olacane just
a front company?

01:29:11.947 --> 01:29:16.051
Olacane? Why are you asking
about Olacane?

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.521
BARRY: Just
interested in how...

01:29:18.654 --> 01:29:22.925
Uh, just, you know,
interested in how
other people do

01:29:23.058 --> 01:29:25.928
things like I used to do.

01:29:26.061 --> 01:29:27.530
Look, I've gotta go.

01:29:27.663 --> 01:29:30.466
I hope you fellas enjoy
the rest of your stay
here in LA.

01:29:30.599 --> 01:29:32.668
Catch a Clipper game
or something.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.774
What the...

01:29:38.907 --> 01:29:41.410
Boss...
Check him.

01:29:41.544 --> 01:29:43.879
Shit, cover's blown,
cover's blown.
Move in.

01:29:44.012 --> 01:29:45.481
What's this?

01:29:46.615 --> 01:29:47.683
It's a wire.

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:50.285
You know something?
Screw this job.

01:29:56.992 --> 01:29:58.293
Don's money.

01:30:03.932 --> 01:30:05.133
Come on. Come on.

01:30:06.802 --> 01:30:08.236
Come on.

01:30:17.813 --> 01:30:19.047
Freeze! FBI!

01:30:19.181 --> 01:30:21.450
Drop the case!
Down on the floor.

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:25.253
Stay right where you are.

01:30:25.387 --> 01:30:27.122
Let's go.
Down to base camp.

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:37.633
MIKEY: When I heard
Barry was chasing
after bad guys in his movie,

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:40.769
I said, "Come on, Barry.
I mean, let's get real.

01:30:40.903 --> 01:30:42.370
"There's no way you did this.

01:30:42.505 --> 01:30:44.573
"You're not an action hero."

01:30:50.345 --> 01:30:54.950
SCOTT: The FBI did credit
Barry for his multiple efforts
to uncover fraud.

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:57.319
But there was more
to the story.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:30:59.221
Hey, genius, come here.
Yeah.

01:30:59.354 --> 01:31:01.456
Let me ask you something.

01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:03.526
What would you have done
if you caught those guys?

01:31:03.659 --> 01:31:05.193
They are kind of big,
aren't they?

01:31:06.361 --> 01:31:08.697
I learned in prison,
in a shower of all places,

01:31:08.831 --> 01:31:13.135
that when you
do the right thing,
God takes care of the details.

01:31:16.872 --> 01:31:19.474
Good job, by the way.

01:31:19.608 --> 01:31:20.843
Merry Christmas.

01:31:23.912 --> 01:31:26.048
SCOTT: What's ironic
here is that

01:31:26.181 --> 01:31:31.253
while Barry was bragging
about the $1.6 billion
in fraud he'd uncovered,

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:33.956
he was hammering companies
whose stock he'd shorted

01:31:34.089 --> 01:31:39.194
in a series of attacks
often based on misleading
or false charges.

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:41.163
Causing not the companies

01:31:41.296 --> 01:31:46.569
but thousands
of innocent shareholders
to lose well over $3 billion.

01:31:46.702 --> 01:31:49.337
I always wondered
why no one ever
really talks about

01:31:49.471 --> 01:31:52.741
how much he had cost
all of those people.

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:57.646
Way more than any amount
of fraud that he ever
uncovered or prevented.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:00.649
He was really
on the right road, he had
everything going for him

01:32:00.783 --> 01:32:02.551
and to go this crazy,

01:32:02.685 --> 01:32:05.487
to do the things that he did,
even I was surprised.

01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:07.856
And, look, not too much
surprises me.

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:10.893
I've been on the street
a long time and I've seen
just about everything.

01:32:11.026 --> 01:32:14.062
I don't think
I've ever seen the extent
of what Barry has done.

01:32:14.196 --> 01:32:17.299
I mean, this was a Madoff
type of thing. It turned out
to be his downfall.

01:32:17.432 --> 01:32:23.538
I watched Barry do
an impassioned sermon that to
me was unbelievable oratory.

01:32:23.672 --> 01:32:28.877
And he would then follow
that up after motivating
his entire parish,

01:32:29.011 --> 01:32:31.880
and go out in the lobby
and accept a check
from somebody

01:32:32.014 --> 01:32:36.018
that he knew he was
going to misappropriate
and spend improperly.

01:32:36.151 --> 01:32:39.855
I know we're supposed
to forgive. As Christians,

01:32:39.988 --> 01:32:41.857
we're supposed to forgive.

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:45.327
Maybe I can say I forgive,
but I cannot forget.

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:48.496
I cannot ever forget
what he has done.

01:32:50.766 --> 01:32:53.235
He stole more than $3 million
from the church personally,

01:32:53.368 --> 01:32:58.974
and multiple millions
of dollars from the people
in the church privately.

01:32:59.107 --> 01:33:04.312
And, boy, he took money
in the millions from people,

01:33:04.446 --> 01:33:05.781
but he took my reputation

01:33:05.914 --> 01:33:09.451
at... Which, you could always
get money back.

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:10.919
The comeback that he made

01:33:11.053 --> 01:33:14.589
and the impact
that he was truly making
was worthy.

01:33:14.723 --> 01:33:17.492
But that story didn't end
the way it could have.

01:33:17.626 --> 01:33:21.363
And I think when selfishness
and greed come in there,
it sent him back.

01:33:21.496 --> 01:33:23.799
It was a very tragic ending.

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:28.170
And tragic not just for Barry,
for the people that were hurt.

01:33:28.303 --> 01:33:30.973
His whole life was an act.

01:33:31.106 --> 01:33:34.409
His whole life was an act.

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:36.544
That's the bottom line.

01:33:36.679 --> 01:33:39.581
MIKEY: Barry was
a master storyteller.

01:33:39.715 --> 01:33:42.384
So even with Peanut,
for all I know

01:33:42.517 --> 01:33:44.753
it was the same as
Jimmy Stewart's
Harvey the bunny.

01:33:44.887 --> 01:33:48.123
LEROY: I don't think
the Peanut story
was all true.

01:33:48.256 --> 01:33:49.758
I think there was a Peanut,

01:33:49.892 --> 01:33:53.896
but I don't think it went down
like Barry said it went down.

01:34:38.807 --> 01:34:43.411
This match right here
is me and your life.

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:50.652

can't overcome
the power of one light,

01:34:50.786 --> 01:34:52.888
