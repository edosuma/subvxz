00:12.267 --> 00:15.133
Narrator: Coming up,
why is Joe having a ball?

00:17.533 --> 00:19.967
What's got Murr
keeping the faith?

00:19.967 --> 00:22.767
I'd like a third shot
at priesthood.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.033
And which losing Jokers
will go, "Goo-goo, ga-ga,"

00:27.033 --> 00:29.233
in tonight's
triple punishment?

00:29.233 --> 00:31.067
Oh!

00:31.067 --> 00:33.900
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:33.900 --> 00:34.967
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:36.667 --> 00:38.300
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:40.100 --> 00:42.833
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:42.833 --> 00:44.867
Joe: Larry!

00:48.433 --> 00:50.167
Smile, bitches.

00:50.167 --> 00:51.967
Today we are
fashion photographers

00:51.967 --> 00:53.500
working with models
on their photo shoots.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.167
While taking pictures,
you're gonna have to do

00:55.167 --> 00:56.533
and say what the other guys
tell you.

00:56.533 --> 00:58.900
If you refuse anything,
you lose.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.367
I did a little
modeling in my day.

01:01.367 --> 01:02.600
Before photos?

01:04.267 --> 01:07.167
**

01:07.167 --> 01:10.400
Joe: All right.
Adelante Studios. Here we go.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.600
We're ready, Sal.
Where you at?

01:11.600 --> 01:14.367
Sal:
Let's take some photos.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.067
-Wow.

01:16.067 --> 01:18.333
Is that what you think
a photographer looks like?

01:20.967 --> 01:22.833
Hey. How are you?
My name is Salvatore.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.300
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.367
Music choice -- Do you want me
to play Psy, "Gangnam Style"?

01:27.367 --> 01:29.533
Uh, well, I mean,
are you good with no music,

01:29.533 --> 01:31.867
or should I play, like,
Psy's "Gangnam Style"?

01:34.100 --> 01:35.700
-Okay.
-"I don't have any music."

01:35.700 --> 01:37.067
Oh, I don't have
any music.

01:37.067 --> 01:37.767
-Oh.
-Yeah.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.933
Here's what
I want you to do.

01:41.933 --> 01:43.633
"Subtly, give me
the middle finger."

01:43.633 --> 01:45.967
Just casually and subtly
give the middle finger.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.133
Okay.

01:47.133 --> 01:49.567
**

01:52.167 --> 01:53.667
Okay.
Key word being "subtle."

01:53.667 --> 01:56.067
Okay, I want to do it
a little more subtle,

01:56.067 --> 01:57.867
almost like
you're sneaking it.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.633
That's it. Straight up.
I can go  myself.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.100
That's it.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.833
-Ohh!

02:06.833 --> 02:10.067
Okay. Sal, on that cart
over there is a Nerf gun.

02:10.067 --> 02:11.867
I want you to just
fire shots at her

02:11.867 --> 02:14.667
and take pictures of her
dodging the Nerf gun.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.067
**

02:18.067 --> 02:20.267
Q: She noticed it.

02:20.267 --> 02:21.633
Okay.

02:21.633 --> 02:22.833
Okay, watch out.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.633
Q: That looks like
it'll hurt if it hits her!

02:29.633 --> 02:32.400
Slowly raise it up
right at her.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.567
-Okay.
-Here it goes.

02:34.567 --> 02:35.733
Okay.

02:37.067 --> 02:38.800
Okay.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.867
Joe: Sal's laughing!
He's looking...

02:44.333 --> 02:46.567
All right.
That's good.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.767
Q: Take two shots,
look at the camera.

02:48.767 --> 02:51.267
Oh, wow.
That's really good. Okay.

02:51.267 --> 02:53.233
"Oh, yeah.
This dog's in heat."

02:55.467 --> 02:58.567
-And there it is!
-Don't you dare!

02:58.567 --> 03:00.367
Who's next

03:00.367 --> 03:02.333
Let me take a third...

03:04.800 --> 03:06.933
I saw Sal,
and I outdid him.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.833
Thanks for
the inspiration, Sal.

03:12.933 --> 03:14.700
That's great.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.633
I need some, like,
crazy shots for my website.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.433
You need some crazy shots?
Okay, yeah.

03:18.433 --> 03:20.400
Yeah. If you want to jump,
we'll count it on three.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.600
One, two, three. Great.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.400
"Also just don't tell me
how to do my job."

03:25.733 --> 03:27.633
That's great. So we'll
do something like this.

03:27.633 --> 03:29.333
-Oh, my God.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.067
So you don't have to
tell me how to do my job.

03:31.067 --> 03:32.467
I'm able to...

03:34.700 --> 03:36.900
Okay? Yeah.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.667
Okay, ready? Now I want you
to just move around

03:38.667 --> 03:40.200
a little bit in the space.
Move around?

03:40.200 --> 03:42.067
There you go. I'm -- I'm
the photographer. That's right.

03:42.067 --> 03:44.633
I am a photographer,
and I know what I'm doing.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.633
Should we get some seated
on the floor maybe?

03:47.633 --> 03:49.800
Let's do -- Yeah, if you
want to get on the floor.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.067
Yeah.

03:51.067 --> 03:53.933
Again, I'm the
photographer, though.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.800
Lay on the ground
with her, too.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.667
I'm gonna get down
to your level again.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.533
Send in Chase,
and have Chase give him

03:59.533 --> 04:01.733
a kiss on the cheek
and walk right out.

04:01.733 --> 04:04.067
Don't say anything.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.567
Q: He's one of
our producers.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.767
I'm gonna try
one of these, too.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.533
Murr: Here we go.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.267
Joe: There you go.

04:12.267 --> 04:13.833
Thank you, babe.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.833
Okay, so, now I'm gonna
have you do some seated,

04:20.833 --> 04:21.967
if you don't mind.
Mm-hmm.

04:21.967 --> 04:23.933
Since she's sitting,
you should be sitting, too.

04:23.933 --> 04:25.300
Go back and get
the ball in the corner.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.933
All right, Joe, sit on the ball
and never stop bouncing.

04:28.933 --> 04:32.133
Joe: Okay.
You sons of b--

04:34.300 --> 04:37.133
-There you go.
-Bounce higher, bud.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.800
Okay.
Change the expression.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.833
-Look at him!
idiot!

04:42.833 --> 04:44.500
Joe:
Yeah! There it is!

04:46.600 --> 04:49.800
**

04:54.600 --> 04:57.300
the fedora.
these fake glasses.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.200
this scarf.
There you go.

05:01.733 --> 05:04.233
I'm gonna do some
singles first, okay?

05:04.233 --> 05:06.200
Different poses,
stuff like that, okay?

05:06.200 --> 05:08.733
I want you to stomp your
foot every now and again
to get his attention.

05:12.900 --> 05:15.867
**

05:21.600 --> 05:23.733
"Actually, I have
an even newer camera."

05:23.733 --> 05:25.833
I have another camera, too,
an even newer one.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.133
We put another camera
on the side for you.

05:27.133 --> 05:28.567
Grab that camera.

05:28.567 --> 05:30.967
**

05:34.700 --> 05:36.200
Murr: One sec.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.967
I just picked this
one up at Best Buy.

05:39.967 --> 05:42.067
Sal: Now go
under the blanket.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.900
Now just start kind of
like shimmying and shaking.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.967
Just be like --

05:53.367 --> 05:55.367
-Tonight...
-Tonight...

05:55.367 --> 05:58.500
...you will be visited
by three ghosts.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.700
...you will be visited
by three ghosts.

06:04.067 --> 06:05.267
Take the picture!

06:05.267 --> 06:06.733
All right.

06:08.567 --> 06:11.200
Did the flash go off?

06:14.533 --> 06:16.767
Okay, that's it for right now.
Thank you for the help.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.400
Before you go,
apologize to him that you
didn't get an erection.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.433
It's not the norm.

06:20.433 --> 06:23.300
Here it is.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.433
Ergh! God almighty.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.200
I do want to apologize
f-for not

06:27.200 --> 06:28.900
getting an erection
during the shoot, so...

06:31.867 --> 06:33.700
-Oh, my...
-Very nice, buddy.

06:35.233 --> 06:37.067
Just spread that light.

06:38.533 --> 06:40.567
-Oh, that's beautiful.
-Joe's right there.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.967
-Q, call in Joe.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.267
"Just for a little inspiration,
can you just sit on --

06:45.267 --> 06:46.900
on the floor right here,
beside me?"

06:46.900 --> 06:49.400
Could you just sit on the floor
right here beside me?

06:49.400 --> 06:50.800
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.067
Joe: Joe's our photographer
friend. He's our inside man.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.533
All right. We're just
gonna get right into it.

06:54.533 --> 06:56.667
-Okay.
-Take a photo of Joe instead.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.067
**

06:59.067 --> 07:02.100
There you go. Look at that.
Isn't that great?

07:02.100 --> 07:04.367
He -- He's my apprentice.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.767
Joe: Why is his apprentice
sitting next to him?

07:06.767 --> 07:08.700
-He looks like Buddha.
-All right.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.667
"I legally have to tell you
I am a straight white male."

07:11.667 --> 07:15.333
I have to tell you, legally,
I am a straight white male.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.900
**

07:20.100 --> 07:22.500
Give me strong.
Like "Yeah, I am woman."

07:22.500 --> 07:24.333
-There we go.
-Whoa.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.300
-Guns out.
-Holy geez!

07:26.300 --> 07:28.300
"Killer clavicles, boss."

07:28.300 --> 07:31.700
Oh, wow. Look at that.
Killer clavicles, boss.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.967
All right. You can thank Joe
and have him leave.

07:34.967 --> 07:37.067
Joe, thank you. I think we got
what we need out of you.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.933
"But, Joe, I'll take
the French onion soup."

07:38.933 --> 07:40.133
-But, Joe!

07:40.133 --> 07:41.633
I will take
the French onion soup.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.633
Photographer Joe:
Definitely.

07:43.633 --> 07:46.067
Just one, Joe.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.567
-Now Joe's improvising.

07:48.567 --> 07:50.800
Yeah, I'll take a bis--
I'll take a biscuit!

07:50.800 --> 07:53.100
Always take
the biscuit.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.800
Let her talk and just
keep going, "Always
take the biscuit."

07:55.800 --> 07:57.867
So, when did you move
to New York City?

07:57.867 --> 07:59.700
I went to NYU.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.800
Always take
that biscuit.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.467
Murr:
Always take the biscuit!

08:04.467 --> 08:06.567
Joe: He can't do it!
He can't --

08:06.567 --> 08:09.567
-Turn quick and fire at her.
-Turn quick and fire.

08:10.733 --> 08:13.300
-Oh, you were ready for me.
-She got it.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.567
You were ready for me.
All right.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.100
"It's probably one more
photo shoot for me,

08:16.100 --> 08:17.700
and night-night forever,"
and take a shot.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.300
That's good. But it's --
Like, for me, it's different.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.700
It's, like, one more
photo shoot for me,

08:20.700 --> 08:22.233
and then it's
night-night forever.

08:22.233 --> 08:23.733
Oh

08:26.900 --> 08:29.067
Okay. All right.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.600
"In high school, I was
on the yearbook committee."

08:30.600 --> 08:32.500
In high school, I was
on the yearbook committee.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.733
Oh, okay!

08:33.733 --> 08:35.433
"It was a regular
fest."

08:36.733 --> 08:40.333
Yeah, it was a, uh...

08:40.333 --> 08:42.500
Just, it was high school.
It was, you know...

08:46.067 --> 08:48.133
Narrator:
Q and Sal lost their focus,

08:48.133 --> 08:50.767
so they're striking a pose
on the loser board.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.767
Today we are at
Focus Pointe Global

08:52.767 --> 08:55.067
in their waiting room
filling out a questionnaire.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.500
Except we're not gonna
be able to do it,

08:56.500 --> 08:58.300
because our hand's gonna
be all jacked up.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.933
So, we'll ask a stranger in
the room to help us fill it out,

09:00.933 --> 09:03.367
but the answers have been
prepared by the other guys.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.400
If you can't say the answer
that's been given to you

09:05.400 --> 09:07.200
by the other guys,
you lose.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.667
You lose.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.500
**

09:11.500 --> 09:14.233
-There's our boy.
-Look at the arm sling.

09:14.233 --> 09:16.433
-Oh, Murr's arm's jacked up.
-Oh.

09:16.433 --> 09:18.667
**

09:18.667 --> 09:20.667
Joe: This guy
noticed his problem.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.767
Shoot. I don't know
what to do here.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.833
-Here we go!

09:25.833 --> 09:27.067
-We're in.
-We're in, we're in.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.133
What are your biggest
pet peeves?

09:29.133 --> 09:30.367
"Diversity."

09:34.167 --> 09:36.333
Uh...

09:36.333 --> 09:38.067
diversity.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.633
What's my dream job?

09:43.633 --> 09:45.933
"You know what? I'd like
a third shot at priesthood."

09:47.267 --> 09:51.267
You know what? I'd like
a third shot at priesthood.

09:51.267 --> 09:54.933
Okay. Okay.

09:54.933 --> 09:57.900
Okay. "List your hobbies
or activities."

09:57.900 --> 10:00.033
Q: "I'm currently working
on a cookbook...

10:00.033 --> 10:02.000
I'm currently working
on a cookbook...

10:02.000 --> 10:03.667
...based around
the four major...

10:03.667 --> 10:05.367
...based around
the four major...

10:05.367 --> 10:07.033
...body fluids."

10:08.933 --> 10:11.333
...body fluids.

10:13.033 --> 10:17.367
You know, you know you've
got blood, urine, saliva.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.667
-And there's a fourth one.
-Right.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.233
Which we all -- It's okay.
Let's get that.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.200
Okay. And then --
Oh, great, great.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.300
"If you can relive one memory,
what would it be?"

10:26.300 --> 10:27.600
Good question.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.733
"The time I successfully...

10:28.733 --> 10:30.167
It's the time
I successfully...

10:30.167 --> 10:33.933
...riffed off of a co-worker's
N-word joke at an office party."

10:33.933 --> 10:37.000
...riffed on...
All right.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.667
-Ah, the last question.
-You almost had it, buddy!

10:39.667 --> 10:41.767
It all falls apart.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.367
Just -- Just put
my 21st birthday.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.500
-Wow!
-Nice work, buddy.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.633
Damn it!

10:48.967 --> 10:52.733
Joe: Hey. There we go.

10:52.733 --> 10:55.067
Sal: Oh, what to do?

10:55.067 --> 10:57.100
Are you s
Are you sure?

10:57.100 --> 10:58.733
I didn't want to --

10:58.733 --> 11:01.467
-Aww!
-What a nice guy!

11:03.267 --> 11:05.267
-"Puerto Rican Santa."
-Puerto Rican Santa.

11:11.733 --> 11:13.600
Murr:
"August 4th, 1998.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.133
Yeah.
August, 4th, 1998.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.167
A boy in a Sears
department store

11:18.167 --> 11:20.500
made fun of the way I walked.
I want him eliminated."

11:20.500 --> 11:22.333
A boy in a Sears
department store

11:22.333 --> 11:24.133
made fun of the way
I walked.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.533
I'd like him eliminated.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.200
Uh, yeah.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.800
"I use dimethylmercury instead
of inorganic mercury salts

11:35.800 --> 11:39.167
when calibrating my nuclear
magnetic resonance device,

11:39.167 --> 11:41.267
like I'm some kind
of ass ."

11:43.800 --> 11:46.167
I probably use --
I use dimethylmercury

11:46.167 --> 11:48.267
instead of inorganic
mercury salts...

11:48.267 --> 11:50.933
"When calibrating my
nuclear magnetic resonance."

11:50.933 --> 11:53.100
...when calibrating
my nuc-- my nuclear...

11:53.100 --> 11:54.867
-"Magnetic."
-...magnetic...

"Resonance device."

11:56.200 --> 11:58.200
...resonance device like
I'm some kind of ass

12:03.867 --> 12:07.633
Oh! "Biggest one I ever saw
was on my aunt's Great Dane."

12:09.533 --> 12:11.367
Murr:
The biggest pet peeve!

12:11.367 --> 12:15.433
The biggest one I ever saw
was on my aunt's Great Dane.

12:15.433 --> 12:18.200
Yeah, my aunt's Great Dane.
He had a huge pet peeve.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.533
-Well done, Sal!
-Champion, buddy.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.300
-Well done. Got through it.
-Wow.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.367
**

12:27.367 --> 12:29.967
Sal: Oh, no, Q.

12:29.967 --> 12:32.500
Oh, y--
Oh, thank you so much.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.833
-Thank you.
-No problem.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.333
All right.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.733
Joe:
"My mom dropped me off."

12:36.733 --> 12:38.533
My -- Actually,
my mom dropped me off.

12:38.533 --> 12:39.567
"On a motorcycle."

12:39.567 --> 12:40.933
Well --
Well, my mom's motorcycle.

12:40.933 --> 12:42.367
Okay.

12:42.367 --> 12:43.667
"Yesterday."

12:43.667 --> 12:45.167
Yesterday.

12:45.167 --> 12:47.200
Joe: So you've been
here for a day.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.433
I've never heard an answer
fit Q more than that answer.

12:50.433 --> 12:52.567
He just looks like
he got here yesterday.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.400
"Just put
'a variety of eggs.'"

12:57.400 --> 12:59.067
I mean, just put
"A variety of eggs."

12:59.067 --> 13:00.700
I don't think they
need to know hen egg,

13:00.700 --> 13:03.333
quail egg, gull eggs.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.367
Oh, yeah.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.500
Well, they're free if you know
where to find them.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.067
Yeah.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.733
"I've been following
this Indian family

13:13.733 --> 13:15.133
around Manhattan
for the past 38 days."

13:19.300 --> 13:21.900
Joe: Currently...

13:21.900 --> 13:24.700
I've been following this,
uh, sweet Indian family

13:24.700 --> 13:26.933
around Manhattan
the last 38 days.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.600
They just look so happy

13:32.600 --> 13:35.767
that I-I feel like I'm part
of the family if I just...

13:35.767 --> 13:38.100
Yeah. What's next?

13:40.100 --> 13:41.467
-That's all.
I'm done?

13:41.467 --> 13:45.133
To think that I've been trying
to fill it out for 24 hours.

13:46.767 --> 13:49.500
-Oh, Joe's in.
-Wait. Here we go.

13:51.267 --> 13:54.367
Hi.
Yeah, I'm all jacked up.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.067
Would you mind
helping me out with this?

13:56.067 --> 13:58.167
That's it!
He just gets right into it.

14:00.067 --> 14:01.467
Um, okay...

14:01.467 --> 14:03.467
"Oh, my wife always leaves
the toilet seat up."

14:03.467 --> 14:05.867
My -- Yeah.

14:05.867 --> 14:09.067
My wife always leaves
the toilet seat up.

14:10.700 --> 14:12.400
It's a big pet peeve of mine
every time I go in.

14:13.567 --> 14:15.433
My greatest strengths...

14:15.433 --> 14:17.500
"Uh, I'm a
straight-up DILF."

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
Uh, okay.
I'm a straight-up DILF.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.067
-Yeah.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.367
DILF. You know.
"Dad I'd Like to..."

14:24.367 --> 14:26.500
That's what the kids say,
you know?

14:26.500 --> 14:28.433
Yeah.
Straight-up DILF. D-I-L-F.

14:31.067 --> 14:32.367
Murr: "A soul mate."

14:32.367 --> 14:33.767
I would probably
say a soul mate.

14:33.767 --> 14:36.433
"Someone who makes me smile
every morning and night."

14:36.433 --> 14:39.433
Someone who makes me
smile morning and night.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.067
"Epic gazungas."

14:43.167 --> 14:45.733
**

14:45.733 --> 14:47.967
And then definitely...

14:47.967 --> 14:50.167
I would go with, uh...

14:50.167 --> 14:52.700
epic gazungas.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.067
Do I have any bad habits?

14:56.067 --> 14:58.067
How much space is there?

14:58.067 --> 15:00.300
"I do a little peeps
when I toot-toot."

15:02.267 --> 15:05.233
Yeah. Uh, hmm, well...

15:05.233 --> 15:07.067
Yeah, I guess
I'll do a simple one.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.967
I do a little peeps
when I toot-toot.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.867
I do a little peeps
when I toot-toot.

15:10.867 --> 15:13.400
Yeah. "Do a little peeps
when I toot-toot."

15:13.400 --> 15:15.167
What is the hand motion?
I'm sorry?

15:15.167 --> 15:17.367
I do a little -- yeah.
I do a little peeps peeps
when I do a toot-toot.

15:19.733 --> 15:21.300
That's great, man.
Thank you so much.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.600
-No problem, bro.
-Peep peeps.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.833
Narrator:
Adding insult to injury,

15:25.833 --> 15:29.433
Murr is joining Sal and Q
in a triple punishment.

15:31.167 --> 15:33.767
-Out with it. Let's go.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.833
Well, I have
three losers, right?

15:35.833 --> 15:37.633
Do you guys remember
when you punished me

15:37.633 --> 15:39.667
-Yeah.

15:39.667 --> 15:42.500
I'm gonna punish you three
as a parenting know-it-nothing.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.167
We're here on set at
a home-shopping network,

15:44.167 --> 15:45.800
where you guys are filming
your new series,

15:45.800 --> 15:47.967
"3 Men and Your Baby."

15:47.967 --> 15:49.300
Sal: Explain.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.367
There are new parents downstairs
with their babies,

15:51.367 --> 15:53.100
and you guys will be
demonstrating tips

15:53.100 --> 15:55.333
and tricks to them about
how to be better parents.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.100
-I'm not handling a kid.
-Oh, yeah, you are.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.500
I'm not cleaning a diaper,
that's for sure.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.700
So if a kid takes a deuce,

16:01.700 --> 16:03.067
the kid's got to stay
with the deuce.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.933
I wonder if that's one
of the things you should know

16:04.933 --> 16:06.433
how to do
if you're a parent.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.900
Yeah. No, I'm not doing that.
I'm not doing that.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.267
I'm not doing it.

16:10.567 --> 16:12.733
-Oh, I hear a lot of babies.
-I don't like kids.

16:12.733 --> 16:15.533
Joe: I know, and that's why
it's a punishment.

16:15.533 --> 16:17.700
Hi, everybody.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.400
I've scripted out
the whole thing.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.533
There's a teleprompter they got
to read. It's gonna be great.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.333
Q: All right.
Thanks for joining us.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.067
We're "3 Men and Your Baby."

16:25.067 --> 16:26.533
Let's start with
something simple

16:26.533 --> 16:29.533
that needs to be done
all the time --

16:29.533 --> 16:32.467
changing a baby's diaper.

16:32.467 --> 16:35.500
Q, your line!

16:35.500 --> 16:38.233
Q: And I'm about to show you
it's not that hard.

16:38.233 --> 16:41.067
Who wants to lend a baby?
Yeah!

16:41.067 --> 16:43.100
Aww! Hey, sweetheart.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.400
Okay.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.100
What's its name?

16:51.100 --> 16:52.600
-Leora.
-Leora.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.100
"Its." "What's its name"?

16:54.100 --> 16:56.067
Q: All right.
Oh, you got a diaper on.

16:56.067 --> 16:58.267
Oh, she's got
a diaper on already.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.433
They don't know
she has a diaper on already?

17:00.433 --> 17:02.333
-Reverse-engineer it.
-I'm on it.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.500
Yeah. Yeah?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.467
All right.
Just get rid of that.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.167
There you go.
There you go.

17:08.467 --> 17:11.933
Then what we do is --
Yeah, nice and dry.

17:11.933 --> 17:14.167
Sal's got nowhere
to put the diaper!
Here we go.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.267
Sal: You would dispose
of this normally.

17:16.267 --> 17:18.567
The disgust in Sal's face

17:18.567 --> 17:20.567
right now is a mixture
of many emotions.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.900
You're gonna just want
to make sure that's snug.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.367
Yeah, that is as snug
as it's gonna get.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.167
Joe: Okay, we should mention
that it's on backwards.

17:28.567 --> 17:29.867
Oh, my goodness.

17:29.867 --> 17:33.567
You know, let's go with --
That's good enough.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.833
Boom! That was easy!

17:37.900 --> 17:40.200
'Cause that's literally the
first diaper Q's ever changed.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.900
Okay, so, let's go back
to the prompter.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.233
Most babies won't be able
to blow their own nose

17:44.233 --> 17:45.600
until the age of 2.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.767
Murr: So it's your job to keep
your baby's nose clean.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.700
Sal: I'm gonna need
to borrow a baby.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.933
Aww!

17:52.933 --> 17:54.733
If your baby
is really stuffed up,

17:54.733 --> 17:57.533
I recommend this Swedish-made
nasal aspirator.

17:57.533 --> 17:59.467
**

17:59.467 --> 18:01.567
And you put that in --
in the nose.

18:01.567 --> 18:03.800
Joe: Babies can't blow
their nose, Murr.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.833
-This is how it happens.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.933
First, place one end
of the tube

18:10.933 --> 18:12.933
against
the baby's nostril.

18:12.933 --> 18:17.867
Now I'll insert the other end
of the tube into my mouth

18:17.867 --> 18:19.367
-No.
-...and suck out the snot.

18:19.367 --> 18:21.300
'Cause this --
this is what you do.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.133
**

18:25.133 --> 18:28.167
Yep. You see what happened
there? Okay, got it.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.467
Yep. Okay.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.567
All right.
Come on, sweetheart.

18:36.567 --> 18:38.333
Okay, so, let's go back
to the prompter.

18:38.333 --> 18:41.433
Sal: Brian and I are gonna
show you moms how to wear

18:41.433 --> 18:44.567
the top two baby carriers
on the market today.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.967
Sal: It's gonna work
like a backpack,

18:47.967 --> 18:49.533
but the baby goes
in the front.

18:49.533 --> 18:52.067
Just kind of, like,
slip it on like that.

18:52.067 --> 18:55.267
You do, like, a little
connecting thing here.

18:55.267 --> 18:57.200
Now, James,
bring on those babies.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.367
Okay. This is baby Logan.
Oh, okay. Ready?

19:00.367 --> 19:02.867
Now let's put you
in here, Logan.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.167
Q: The baby
should probably face me.

19:10.833 --> 19:13.500
-Okay. Okay.
-Aww! We'll give you back.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.533
It's all right.

19:15.533 --> 19:17.267
There you go.
There's baby Logan.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.533
Q: When it comes to strollers,
there are two main types --

19:21.533 --> 19:23.067
high-end and umbrella.

19:23.067 --> 19:25.233
But don't worry.
They both collapse easily.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.633
Murr:
Okay. So, I have to...

19:27.633 --> 19:29.833
figure out...

19:29.833 --> 19:32.533
Joe:
You just put the brake on.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.367
Q: We fold
so many of these,

19:34.367 --> 19:36.467
it's hard to keep straight
which model we're dealing with.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.800
We fold them all day.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.867
Oh, you mother

19:39.867 --> 19:41.933
-Nope. No.
-Son of a...

19:43.067 --> 19:44.700
Okay.
Let's hold right there.

19:44.700 --> 19:47.300
**

19:47.300 --> 19:49.367
-Yeah, he's -- he --
-That's the new model.

19:49.367 --> 19:50.967
Q: He's familiar
with all the --

19:50.967 --> 19:52.900
He's -- We should say
the director here, Joe,

19:52.900 --> 19:56.100
is also a dad,
so he's a little more familiar

19:56.100 --> 19:57.667
with the products
than we are.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.800
There it is.
All right.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.800
-Oh, it's the new model.
-It's the new model.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.700
It's the new model.
Thanks.

20:03.700 --> 20:07.067
We're "3 Men and Your Baby,"
and remember...

20:07.067 --> 20:08.900
Boom! That was easy!

20:08.900 --> 20:10.333
Tune in next time

20:10.333 --> 20:13.033
when we'll teach
your babies how to swim.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.400
-Well done, boys.
-All right. Thanks.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.233
Yeah!

20:19.233 --> 20:21.167
Well, that was easy.

20:21.167 --> 20:25.400
**

20:25.400 --> 20:28.900
Sal, Q, and Murr just got
spanked in tonight's punishment,

20:28.900 --> 20:30.700
and now we're gonna give you
a behind-the-scenes look

20:30.700 --> 20:33.933
of how it went down,
plus bonus features
from tonight's episode.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.000
Is that cool, Owen?
Ready?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.300
Owen, Q's gonna
want his hat back.

20:39.767 --> 20:42.233
Joe Gatto right there.
He's the man in charge.

20:42.233 --> 20:43.533
We got three losers,

20:43.533 --> 20:47.967
and Joe is, solo,
planning this punishment.

20:47.967 --> 20:50.067
McPartland: I would not want
to have the first time

20:50.067 --> 20:52.500
I had to collapse a stroller
be in front of an audience

20:52.500 --> 20:54.200
-because it's impossible.
-Yeah.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.033
And, I mean, the little --
Putting a onesie together.

20:56.033 --> 20:59.267
The -- Like, the carriers
are impossible.

20:59.267 --> 21:01.333
I still cannot do that by myself
without my wife.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.767
When they punished me about
being a parent, I was like,

21:03.767 --> 21:05.533
"Okay, now I have to punish them
for not being parents."

21:05.533 --> 21:06.967
-Oh, that is brilliant.
-Yeah.

21:06.967 --> 21:09.433
In the same season, just so you
could fire back like that.

21:09.433 --> 21:11.400
Yeah, yeah. Because
it was fresh on my mind.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.600
-Yeah.
-That was a rough one.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.467
Texting and watching
a child at the same time.

21:17.467 --> 21:19.667
-I have no idea.
-No idea. Yeah.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.533
-No!

21:21.533 --> 21:24.067
This whole punishment
is a little bit of, like,
a shout-out to parents.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.733
Yes, it is.
We know it ain't easy.

21:25.733 --> 21:27.767
We know it ain't easy.
The struggle's real.

21:27.767 --> 21:29.800
And we might as well
have some fun with it.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.633
Slightly less worried
than normal,

21:32.633 --> 21:34.267
-'cause I'm absorbing it.
-Right.

21:34.267 --> 21:36.767
I'm absorbing the punishment
alongside Murray and Q.

21:36.767 --> 21:38.233
Well, do -- do you
remember the last time

21:38.233 --> 21:40.633
that Joe picked the three
of your punishments?
Yeah, I do.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.667
You  put
Will Smith's son !

21:43.667 --> 21:45.100
Why would you
do that to me?!

21:45.100 --> 21:46.933
I'm your
best friend, you dope!

21:46.933 --> 21:49.367
Man: Three, two, one.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.667
-"3 Men and Your Baby"!

21:51.667 --> 21:53.833
-The people there.

21:53.833 --> 21:56.067
I know there's a subset
of people out there

21:56.067 --> 21:57.967
that I'm gonna come off
as unlikable to,

21:57.967 --> 21:59.800
but I hate kids.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.167
I don't want to be
anywhere near them.

22:01.167 --> 22:02.400
I know. That's why
it's a punishment.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.967
Yeah, but you understand
the issue here, though.

22:03.967 --> 22:05.233
Like, I'm not gonna
hold them softly.

22:05.233 --> 22:08.100
I'll do most stuff
outside of diapers.

22:08.100 --> 22:09.900
-Yeah.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.833
Yeah, but you can't
make a kid

22:11.833 --> 22:13.967
Oh, can't I?

22:13.967 --> 22:16.467
Is there a kid down there
who  at like 5:00 a.m.

22:16.467 --> 22:18.833
and you've just
been holding them?

22:18.833 --> 22:20.433
We're gonna show you
the perfect way

22:20.433 --> 22:22.200
to install a car seat
to ensure your child

22:22.200 --> 22:24.400
is safe and sound
on the road.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.267
Joe: Do you guys know
how to do that

22:27.267 --> 22:29.233
Yeah, so, the car seat
is over here.

22:29.233 --> 22:30.667
This is a popular model.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.733
I have a little
experience with this.

22:32.733 --> 22:33.967
-Yes.

22:33.967 --> 22:35.533
Of course you do.
We have a company.

22:35.533 --> 22:37.567
-Yeah.

22:37.567 --> 22:39.933
So, this -- Oh, I see.
That does that.

22:39.933 --> 22:41.900
No, this is gonna go
through the crotch area.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.967
-Up. Down. Go down.
-Yeah, this is for that.

22:43.967 --> 22:46.400
Joe: This is the most confused
I've seen the three of you
in my whole life.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.767
Yeah. This goes there.
Then this is if the baby

22:49.767 --> 22:51.600
wants to play with a...rope.

22:54.667 --> 22:55.933
Did we do that right?

22:55.933 --> 22:57.733
So much fumbling
through the things

22:57.733 --> 22:59.233
as it was
handling the kids.

22:59.233 --> 23:00.967
Hoo! As soon as you
pick up the kid,

23:00.967 --> 23:03.700
you start, like,
sweating bullets.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.600
-There, Owen. Right there.
-Yes. Yeah. There you go.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.367
Sal: And you're gonna want to
put their arms through there.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.100
Look at this poor kid!

23:11.100 --> 23:12.933
He's probably better off
doing it by himself.

23:12.933 --> 23:16.300
Boom! That was easy!

23:16.300 --> 23:19.067
Murr: Q, pick up the cat toy
on the cart.

23:19.067 --> 23:20.700
Here we have --
Uh, here.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.400
Joe: Q, she thinks
she's gonna use it.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.100
Use it on yourself
while you're taking photos.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.733
All right, okay.
All right.

23:29.833 --> 23:31.433
Murr: Keep snapping.

23:34.367 --> 23:36.233
-Say, "Sit down."
-All right. Sit down!

23:39.700 --> 23:41.800
-Man, she's so good!
-She doesn't miss a beat!

23:41.800 --> 23:43.900
She was like ba-boom,
and it's like a good pose.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.333
Say, "Some of those
probably came out.
I blacked out for a minute."

23:46.333 --> 23:49.667
Some of those probably came out.
I blacked out for a minute.
