WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:04.372
(big band music playing)

00:11.845 --> 00:13.947
(sighs)

00:17.085 --> 00:18.686
What's with
the new 'do?

00:18.719 --> 00:20.588
I got it
at the senior center.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.990
I like that it's free,
what I don't like is

00:23.023 --> 00:25.226
they give you the last hairstyle
they remember having.

00:25.259 --> 00:29.097
But the bigger news is, we have
new back fence neighbors.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.831
Someone moved into
the Weirdo House?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.200
Isn't this the Weirdo House?

00:32.233 --> 00:34.368
No, this is the Lovable
Eccentric House.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.105
We've had a bad string of luck
with our back fence neighbors.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.740
Everyone who's moved in there
has been really odd.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.377
Damn it!

00:43.411 --> 00:45.713
Another rolling blackout.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.381
They only roll through
our neighborhood.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.217
Bet those snobs in the
hoity-toity neighborhood

00:49.250 --> 00:51.252
don't have to deal with
their power going out.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.722
Jimmy, speaking of which,
that's us. Let's go home.

00:54.755 --> 00:58.359
I can see why people like
walking around.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.361
We have pretty
interesting neighbors.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.796
Looks like the Hoffmans
are trying to beat the heat.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.371
Ah, Old Lady Stevens.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.805
She's so sweet.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.974
Oh, look,
she's got a date.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.876
Wait-- what is that?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.278
If she's gonna do that,

01:17.311 --> 01:20.013
she should crochet
herself some curtains.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.817
Oh, hey, check out Elijah
the Bearded Neighbor.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.453
I didn't know he was musical.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.860
I'm not so sure he is.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.800
Oh, tree root.

01:39.833 --> 01:40.968
Sorry, buddy.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.036
Almost stepped on your foot.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.840
Ooh, look how normal
they look.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.242
This is it, Burt.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.844
We're gonna be
borrowing sugar in no time.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.981
Oh, hello.
Can I help you?

01:54.014 --> 01:56.116
Hi, uh, we're Virginia
and Burt,

01:56.150 --> 01:57.351
your back fence neighbors.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.752
Well, hi, there,
Virginia and Burt.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.589
We're Gary and Gina.
Say hi, Gina.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.191
Hi.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.826
Well, we just wanted to welcome
you to the neighborhood.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.329
We really appreciate that.
Don't we, Gina?

02:08.362 --> 02:10.498
Yes.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.437
Well, we should go.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.805
Wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.173
(softly):
Whoo...hoo-hoo.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.275
We'd love to.
Right, Gina?

02:21.309 --> 02:22.810
Yes.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.144
Great. It's a date.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.880
We'll see you at 6:00,
back fence neighbors.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.884
What the heck
are you doing?

02:30.918 --> 02:32.553
Why'd you invite them
to dinner?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.987
What do you mean?

02:34.021 --> 02:37.124
Gary's creepy.
What was with that smile?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.560
It was nice.
He was being friendly.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.061
Why didn't Gina talk?

02:41.094 --> 02:42.496
I like that about her.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.565
I'm a big talker,
I need a big listener.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.535
A mute would be ideal,
but I don't want to be greedy.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.638
And now we have
to have dinner
with them. Uh!

02:50.671 --> 02:53.207
This day couldn't
possibly get any worse.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.244
Don't worry, buddy.
I got ya.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.379
(groans)

02:58.412 --> 03:00.714
Burt! (gasps)

03:00.748 --> 03:02.283
Are you okay?

03:14.628 --> 03:17.431
They did an all right job
with this cast.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.933
You know, as a doctor,
I'm not supposed to do this

03:19.967 --> 03:21.735
without a formal examination
and prescription,

03:21.769 --> 03:24.505
but you're a neighbor,
so take this.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.407
Oh, no, thanks.
Come on.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.542
There we go.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.778
(grunting)

03:30.811 --> 03:32.946
Hey, look at those mitts on you.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.748
You got some
really striking hands.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.350
I never really
thought about it.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.352
As a hand surgeon,
I've seen a lot in my time.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.388
May I?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.759
My God.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.061
Just when you think the
fingers are the main attraction,

03:48.095 --> 03:50.564
you've got those thumbs
that really close the show.

03:50.598 --> 03:54.067
So, Gary, you like sports?

03:54.101 --> 03:55.903
I know what you're getting at.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.906
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war!

03:59.840 --> 04:01.208
(groans)

04:01.241 --> 04:04.912
So, why'd you and Gary move
to Natesville?

04:04.945 --> 04:06.447
Everyone I know was
just born here

04:06.480 --> 04:08.215
and doesn't have
the energy to leave.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.750
We got tired of the big city.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.819
Oh. You're from a big city?

04:11.852 --> 04:14.522
No.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.825
Come on, Burt,
Best out of seven!

04:17.858 --> 04:19.660
Come on!
No, we should

04:19.693 --> 04:21.429
really call it a night.
Right, Virginia?

04:21.462 --> 04:22.896
My leg is barking.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.132
All right. I guess it is getting
a little late.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.800
You ready, Gina?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.235
Yes.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.004
Oh! Oh, okay.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.507
Aren't you sweet?

04:36.677 --> 04:38.278
I'm sorry, guys.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.481
I'll never put you
through that again.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.318
Wow. These were

04:44.352 --> 04:46.253
already doing this,
but if they weren't,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.488
they would be now.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.089
All my pajamas were in
the laundry,

04:49.122 --> 04:50.858
but I found this
in Maw Maw's closet.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.826
GARY:
Hey, back fence neighbors!

04:52.860 --> 04:55.729
Oh, my God,
this is what we wanted!

04:57.030 --> 05:00.033
Hi, Gary!

05:00.067 --> 05:01.301
How you doing?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.138
How's it going?

05:05.172 --> 05:07.040
Really well.
Ooh, nice backyard.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.742
(grunts)

05:16.884 --> 05:18.486
(grunts)

05:34.067 --> 05:36.804
Can you hold onto this
for a little bit for me?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.238
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.174
Oh, God, no, don't take that!

05:41.208 --> 05:43.010
What are you doing?!

05:43.043 --> 05:47.047
Yeah!
Yeah. Hey. Hey, Burt!
Is that you in there?

05:47.080 --> 05:51.084
Hey, Gary! I was just trying...

05:55.756 --> 05:56.790
What was that?!

05:57.625 --> 05:58.726
What did he give you?

05:58.759 --> 06:00.193
Relax, Burt.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.263
He just wanted me to hold
a package for him.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.565
I don't like the sound of that.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.333
Well, get used to it,
'cause he said

06:06.366 --> 06:07.868
there'll be more packages
delivered to us.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.670
What's in them?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.672
I don't know. I didn't ask.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.906
(glass breaks)

06:12.940 --> 06:14.775
What the devil?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.280
Everything is fine!
Everything is under...!

06:22.983 --> 06:24.251
Where'd you get that?

06:24.284 --> 06:26.854
Jimmy's old Miss Snoops-A-Lot
spy kit.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.257
Oh, I'd forgot he went through
that weird Nancy Drew phase.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.225
(Gina screams)

06:41.469 --> 06:42.803
(ticking)

06:47.808 --> 06:49.176
Burt!

06:50.343 --> 06:51.779
Tell me you didn't open
Gary's package.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.213
I would, but I'd be lying.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.316
And I would never lie to you,
unlike Gary,

06:56.349 --> 06:57.718
who's clearly lying to his wife.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.320
"All my love, Carlotta."

07:00.353 --> 07:02.422
Exactly.
His wife's name is Gina.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.391
So either he's the world's
worst speller,

07:04.424 --> 07:07.127
or he's having an affair
and using us to hide it.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.662
And now he's done something
to Gina.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.130
Burt, you're acting crazy.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.899
It's just a watch
with someone's name on it.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.233
What about the screams

07:13.266 --> 07:14.802
we heard before the blinds
were closed?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.904
People scream
for all kinds of reasons.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.271
I scream, you scream,

07:18.305 --> 07:19.673
we all scream for ice cream.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.008
That's three reasons
right there.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.009
(doorbell rings)

07:22.042 --> 07:23.410
That's the police.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.679
We'll see what they have
to say about this.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.080
Hello, Chances.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.583
Auxiliary Officer Hughes
at your service.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.919
I understand you reported
a disturbance?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.487
I thought you said you
called the police?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.589
I thought I did, too.
Why'd they send you?

07:35.623 --> 07:36.857
If you really want
to know,

07:36.890 --> 07:38.659
the "real" police won't come
here anymore

07:38.692 --> 07:40.127
because you already hit
your 911 quota.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.362
911. What's your emergency?
(birds cawing)

07:42.395 --> 07:45.032
There's a bunch of birds
outside our window!

07:45.065 --> 07:47.801
They're just...
Oh, wait, they're gone.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.369
Never mind.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.172
911, what's your emergency?
Someone's in my house!

07:52.205 --> 07:55.142
It's a murderer!
You have to help me!

07:55.175 --> 07:57.044
(screams)

07:57.077 --> 07:58.712
Look what somebody threw out.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.514
(screeching notes)

08:00.548 --> 08:02.683
Never mind.

08:02.716 --> 08:07.320
So your neighbors argue, smile
and ask you to take their mail?

08:08.522 --> 08:10.558
You got nothing!
In fact, the only crime

08:10.591 --> 08:11.825
that's been committed here

08:11.859 --> 08:13.794
is mail fraud,
and you two did it.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.329
Oh, no. This is Burt's deal,
not mine.

08:16.363 --> 08:19.132
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna take this to go.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.068
I've got one humdinger
of a toothache,

08:21.101 --> 08:24.137
and this is making it feel
much better.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.906
(swishing)

08:29.242 --> 08:31.679
Mom thought that maybe
we should come over,

08:31.712 --> 08:34.214
make sure you weren't
out here acting crazy.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.716
What have you done with her,
Gary?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.818
You smiley-faced
son of a bitch!

08:37.851 --> 08:41.188
Whoa, I thought
you were at work.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.825
I was. Knock Knock Knock
is trying out theme weeks.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.493
It's Retro Week.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.661
It's beautiful.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.696
I know.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.030
I was afraid to get it dirty,

08:50.063 --> 08:51.832
so the houses aren't very clean.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.333
Have you been
out here peering

08:53.366 --> 08:55.535
into Gina and Gary's house
all day?

08:55.569 --> 08:58.606
Yeah. And do you know
who I haven't seen? Gina.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.574
Don't you think
that's a little strange?

09:00.608 --> 09:02.610
Maybe she's staying away
from the windows
because some weirdo's

09:02.643 --> 09:04.244
spying on her
from the next house.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.413
No. If there was some weirdo
spying on her,

09:06.446 --> 09:07.615
I would've seen it.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.882
We're gonna head out of here.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.686
You know what?
I'm gonna go over there

09:12.720 --> 09:14.855
and settle this whole thing
right now.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.591
Also, I want
the whole neighborhood
to see me in this dress.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.359
No, you can't. It's not safe.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.261
At least take one
of these walkie-talkies with you

09:21.294 --> 09:23.230
so I can listen in and
make sure you're okay.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.332
Come on, Pigtails,
let's do this.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.471
(quietly):
I'm approaching
the residence, over.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.784
Hey, Virginia! My favorite
back fence neighbor!

09:43.817 --> 09:46.553
Look at you
all gussied up.
Aw.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.556
If I didn't know any better, I'd
say you had a fella on the side.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.325
VIRGINIA (chuckling):
Oh, Gary, you're such a card.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.994
Is Gina home?
I wanted to know

09:54.027 --> 09:55.562
if she'd like
to join me for a walk.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.164
GARY:
She's not home.
Where is she?

09:57.197 --> 09:59.599
She went on a trip.
Yeah, she went on a trip.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.168
A one-way trip.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.569
To death.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.504
Oh, really?

10:04.537 --> 10:08.308
Oh. Well, last night she didn't
mention anything about a trip.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.677
How exciting.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.612
Is she visiting family
back in... the big city?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.648
Yes. She'll be
gone a while.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.316
Yeah, she'll be gone a while.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.918
To death.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.619
Oh, just one last thing.

10:19.653 --> 10:22.956
Uh, I wonder if I could borrow
a cup of brown sugar.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.658
I'm afraid
we're all out.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.959
Oh.

10:25.993 --> 10:29.529
Well, good night.
You look beautiful.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.113
Oh, no. What are those?
Oh, calm down.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.048
It's just two more packages
that came for Gary.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.482
I found 'em on the porch.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.651
You need to relax.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.854
I think I know just
how to do it.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.789
Unzip me.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.991
You're gonna love
this old-timey underwear.

10:58.025 --> 11:01.328
I feel like my boobs
are strapped into party hats.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.197
I like party hats, boobs
and old things.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.501
Oh, damn these
rolling blackouts.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.683
(insects trilling)

11:39.366 --> 11:41.168
What do you think?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.702
I think
he's guilty.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.439
Look at this!

11:46.473 --> 11:48.909
Guilty of what?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.179
Washing his dishes?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.381
No. No, he was...

11:54.414 --> 11:56.516
he was wrapping
an axe in newspaper.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.118
Why would he do that?

11:58.151 --> 11:59.452
Because he killed
his wife.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.788
He chopped her up

12:00.821 --> 12:02.555
and now he's looking
to hide the evidence

12:02.589 --> 12:05.158
in the only place he knows
we'll never look...
the newspaper.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.763
I'm starting to believe
Barney was right.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.631
Those pain meds
are making you

12:11.664 --> 12:13.867
a little loopy
in the old noggin.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.136
Don't you think it's
just a little suspicious

12:16.169 --> 12:17.871
that all of a sudden
Gina takes a trip?

12:17.905 --> 12:18.972
Without her husband?

12:19.006 --> 12:20.974
What business
is it of yours?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.242
Because it's
everyone's business

12:22.275 --> 12:24.611
when there's
been a murder.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.080
(sighs)
Burt...

12:29.649 --> 12:31.251
Leave it alone.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.757
(footsteps, a thud)

12:37.791 --> 12:40.427
(shovel striking dirt)

12:40.460 --> 12:42.495
Burt, did you
hear that?

12:42.529 --> 12:45.165
That sounds like
murder to me.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.507
Oh, my God.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.843
He killed her.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.115
*

13:02.149 --> 13:04.184
You were right, Burt.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.485
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

13:05.518 --> 13:06.820
That's okay.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.088
I'm almost never right.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.489
You were just playing the odds.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.426
Oh, my God,
what a horror.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.162
Oh, my God, did he hit you?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.930
My dentist? No.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.265
No, not since the first time.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.001
But in his defense,
I did bite him.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.669
Oh, the neighbors.
Oh, yeah, they're fine.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.137
I just went over
and talked to them...

13:24.171 --> 13:25.372
both of them.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.640
Wait, Gina was there?

13:27.674 --> 13:28.842
Yeah.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.677
She was fine.
And polite.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.479
She didn't mention anything
about all my drooling.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.147
But Gary said
she went on a trip.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.616
Well, maybe she got homesick
and came back early.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.985
All perfectly legal.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.619
Then what was he doing
burying something

13:39.652 --> 13:41.388
in the backyard,
at night?

13:41.421 --> 13:44.224
Yeah. He was planting
evening primroses.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.659
He says they take better
when you plant them at night.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.128
Shoot.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.897
As a professional gardener,
that does add up.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.331
Leave this thing alone

13:51.364 --> 13:53.066
and stop calling 911.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.002
Or next time,
they won't even send me.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.405
Well, Gina's alive.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.806
(door closes)
That is great.

13:59.839 --> 14:00.974
Yeah.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.009
Phew.
Yeah.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.710
That is a relief.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.680
Is it weird that
I'm a little...

14:07.714 --> 14:08.916
Disappointed?
Yeah.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.884
Me, too.
Are we bad people?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.719
No. No, no.
We just got caught up.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.587
The important
thing is...

14:14.621 --> 14:16.689
Gina's alive.

14:16.723 --> 14:17.857
Right.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.092
Yes.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.293
Right.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.733
Still disappointed.

14:28.068 --> 14:31.238
Virginia, have you seen
my new scratching fork?

14:31.271 --> 14:32.572
I lost another
one in here.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.873
(silverware jangles)
Just a second.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.109
I'm just cleaning
up out here.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.390
Burt, look!

14:50.423 --> 14:53.426
There's a woman
with Gary

14:53.460 --> 14:55.562
and it's not Gina.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.730
I bet you it's that
slut-whore Carlotta

14:57.764 --> 14:59.132
he's been
sleeping with.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.968
BURT:
I bet that's who Barney saw

15:01.001 --> 15:02.135
and thought was Gina.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.137
I knew Gina was dead!

15:04.171 --> 15:05.438
Which is very sad.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.706
Of course.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.541
It's horrible.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.145
Just dig it up, and I'll get rid
of everything in the house.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.217
They're getting rid
of the evidence.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.619
We have to do something
before it's all gone.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.990
I have a plan.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.425
Hello, Mr. Stewart.

15:25.458 --> 15:29.096
This is, uh, Auxiliary
Police Officer Barney Hughes.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.131
Turns out
we really could use your help

15:31.164 --> 15:32.832
down here at the precinct,

15:32.865 --> 15:35.802
so, if you and your wife could
come down here right away

15:35.835 --> 15:38.005
and answer a few questions
for us,

15:38.038 --> 15:39.672
well, that'd be just swell.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.008
(snorts)

15:41.041 --> 15:42.742
VIRGINIA:
Burt, what was that accent?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.911
I was doing Barney.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.613
Oh. It sounded
like George Bailey

15:46.646 --> 15:47.981
from that Christmas movie

15:48.015 --> 15:50.183
where everyone was
better off without him.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.618
(tires squealing)

15:51.651 --> 15:54.221
They just left.
I'm going in.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.694
He lied.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.665
He has a whole freaking bag.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.467
That monster.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.777
(door opens)

16:17.810 --> 16:20.313
(footsteps approaching)

16:22.015 --> 16:24.484
(wooden creaking)

16:31.491 --> 16:33.826
(electrical hissing,
light clinks off)

16:34.861 --> 16:37.297
Jimmy?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.866
Sabrina?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.471
Well, hi there, neighbor.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.140
Gary? Hey.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.142
I know you're injured,
so I let myself in.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.877
Although, you should really
lock your front door.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.146
What can I do for you
at this late hour?

16:53.180 --> 16:54.414
Yeah, sorry about that.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.083
Was on my way out
to run some errands,

16:56.116 --> 16:58.017
I saw your light was on,
so I thought I'd swing by

16:58.051 --> 17:00.019
and pick up those packages
I asked Virginia to hold.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.488
Oh, sure.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.822
One's on the nightstand.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.557
The other one's out
in the living room.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.026
Thanks. Well,

17:07.060 --> 17:08.661
I guess I'll be on my way.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.198
Great. Good-bye.

17:12.399 --> 17:16.536
Say... you didn't
open this, did you?

17:16.569 --> 17:18.771
'Cause it looks like someone
ripped it open, and then...

17:18.805 --> 17:20.173
crudely rewrapped it.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.875
Must have come that way.
Damn post office.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.011
Oh, and another thing.
(floor board creaks)

17:25.044 --> 17:27.714
There was an odd little man
in a child's police costume

17:27.747 --> 17:29.682
at my house earlier
asking strange questions.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.884
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

17:31.918 --> 17:34.954
I would not. No.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.456
(static)

17:36.489 --> 17:39.626
What was that?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.461
Oh. Uh...

17:41.494 --> 17:44.097
Is that Little Miss
Snoops-A-Lot?

17:44.131 --> 17:46.266
I think that's Little Miss
Mind-Your-Own-Business.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.800
Can I have that back, please?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.269
VIRGINIA:
Burt! I found something.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.703
Gary's definitely a murderer.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.773
What the hell is she doing
in my house?

17:53.806 --> 17:55.142
(grunting)

17:55.175 --> 17:56.409
Cheese and rice.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.444
(grunts)
Yeah.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.146
(grunt, power whooshes off)

17:59.179 --> 18:01.047
Damn rolling blackouts!

18:01.080 --> 18:02.782
Oh.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.951
(grunting)

18:04.984 --> 18:07.620
(sighs)
(groaning)

18:09.489 --> 18:11.758
(both grunting)

18:17.797 --> 18:20.600
(soft grunting)

18:21.801 --> 18:22.735
(touch tones sounding)

18:22.769 --> 18:24.437
No!

18:24.471 --> 18:26.573
(grunting)

18:26.606 --> 18:27.974
(whooshing)

18:28.007 --> 18:29.909
(shrieking)
Oh.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.611
(grunt)
What's going on?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.112
Ooh. Help me
with the mattress.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.748
(phone ringing)

18:35.782 --> 18:38.318
(crickets chirping)

18:47.460 --> 18:50.797
Oh, isn't that nice?
She finally found someone.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.665
(laughs airily)
Oh, God.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.006
*

19:08.315 --> 19:10.517
I'm coming,
Virginia!

19:10.550 --> 19:12.219
(grunting)

19:12.252 --> 19:13.986
Virginia?!
Burt!

19:14.020 --> 19:16.689
Wait. Virginia! Oh.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.458
Virginia, the slut-whore

19:18.491 --> 19:19.892
has a gun pointed at your...

19:19.926 --> 19:22.995
I mean, the reasonable,
classy lady

19:23.029 --> 19:24.931
has a gun pointed at your head!

19:30.337 --> 19:31.704
Just put the gun down,
Carlotta.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.473
Gary, who are
these people?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.174
My crazy back-fence neighbors.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.509
Hey, I may be crazy,

19:36.543 --> 19:38.578
but at least I'm
not a sugar liar.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.979
I saw the bag!

19:40.012 --> 19:41.348
Stand down.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.815
They're just a
couple of civilians.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.353
Huh? What?
Who the hell are you?

19:46.386 --> 19:47.920
Agent Heidi Thompson.
(garbled radio transmission)

19:47.954 --> 19:49.389
Quick, get him into the van.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.324
(Virginia gasps)
Why'd you do this to me, Burt?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.759
You ruined everything!

19:52.792 --> 19:54.160
And I loved your thumbs!

19:54.193 --> 19:56.696
(garbled radio transmission,
Virginia sighs)

19:57.930 --> 19:59.432
He was in Witness Protection.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.568
The man you know
as Gary Stewart

20:01.601 --> 20:03.436
testified
against the Russian mob.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.172
We've been relocating witnesses
to that house for years.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.874
That's why
it's the Weirdo House.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.776
So, then,
who's Carlotta?

20:09.809 --> 20:11.077
That's Gina's real name.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.211
Oh.
She left when she found out

20:12.245 --> 20:13.280
that Gary was having

20:13.313 --> 20:14.347
his old friends send him these

20:14.381 --> 20:16.115
mementos
of his old life.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.684
It compromised their safety.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.286
But I saw him
with an axe.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.687
That's an award Gary got

20:20.720 --> 20:22.455
for his work
as a volunteer firefighter,

20:22.489 --> 20:24.591
but it had his real name
engraved on it.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.526
I found one more
box on the porch.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.128
You're going to want
to look at this.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.099
(sighs)

20:33.132 --> 20:34.967
We thought these might show up.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.770
Gary was one of the mob's
most notorious hit men.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.707
He used to collect
his victims' thumbs as trophies.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.642
They called him
"The Hand Surgeon."
(gasps)

20:42.675 --> 20:44.977
So, Burt, we were right.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.879
Gary really is a murderer.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.215
Oh, my God!
Virginia, think about it.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.717
The thumb wrestling.
(gasps)

20:50.750 --> 20:52.118
The thumb compliments.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.953
If we hadn't blown
Gary's cover,

20:53.986 --> 20:56.088
my days of doing "this guy"
jokes would be over.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.424
Oh.

20:57.457 --> 21:00.026
(crow caws)

21:01.528 --> 21:04.063
Well, someone else is
finally moving in.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.265
Now that it's not a witness
protection house anymore,

21:06.299 --> 21:08.601
maybe we'll finally get some
normal neighbors for once?

21:08.635 --> 21:11.471
Let's go see who it is.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.008
Hello.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.810
WOMAN:
Norman?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.646
Who's at the door?

21:19.679 --> 21:22.081
Nobody, Mother.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.716
Can I help you?

Gracias, amigo.
