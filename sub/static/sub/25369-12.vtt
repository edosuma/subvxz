00:24.441 --> 00:26.735

00:26.735 --> 00:31.448
It, uh,
went about as expected.

That's a new low.

00:35.077 --> 00:38.080

After villains
crawled out of the woodwork

00:38.080 --> 00:41.083
to try and collect Chameleon's
bounty on my head,

00:41.083 --> 00:44.044

00:53.637 --> 00:55.681

to school.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.558
And now that Chameleon's
behind bars, things have
gotta be looking up.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.644

Uh, okay.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.617

stick that landing.

Radio?

01:39.099 --> 01:41.435

The bounty's gone.

[mutters]
four dollars sound?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.293
Bounty or no,
this changes nothing.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.129
You had me thrown in prison,

02:09.129 --> 02:11.715

you made my team lose.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.168
Now excuse me.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.797
I feel a nap coming on.
[muffled]
I hate you, Spider‐Man!

02:51.797 --> 02:53.840

03:09.356 --> 03:12.693
Goblins, octopuses,
chameleons,

03:12.693 --> 03:16.321
and yet it's
the evil mastermind exhaustion
that does me in.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.573
[handcuffs clink]
All right.
Don't do anything, Spidey.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.368
You're coming with us
for questioning.
[groans]

03:21.368 --> 03:24.287
Good work, but I can
take it from here, Officer.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.501
Do you know
how much pressure I'm getting
to bring you in?

03:29.501 --> 03:33.922
Let me guess.
Rage face, mustache,
flying spittle when he talks?

03:33.922 --> 03:37.551
Destruction of property,
public endangerment,
trespassing.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.553
That's a big list of things
you're accused of.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.847
So I can't believe
I'm doing this.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.392
Uh, neither can I?

03:45.392 --> 03:47.269
You've done a lot of good
in this city.

03:47.269 --> 03:51.815
So instead of fighting you,
I'd rather work with you.

03:51.815 --> 03:55.527
Thanks, Chief Watanabe.
I'll help any way I can,
obviously.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.447
Good, because Chameleon
isn't talking,

03:58.447 --> 04:02.242
and we have reason to believe
he wasn't the mastermind
behind the bounty on your head.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.078
He was only a hired gun.
Wait.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.081
So there's a big
shadowy boss out there
who wants me gone.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.125
What makes you think Chameleon
wasn't behind it?

04:10.125 --> 04:12.085
He's clammed up.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.422
Something, or someone,
scares him more than jail time.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.091
And his gear was too advanced
for him to have worked alone.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.427
Our labs ran their tests.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.221
Haven't been able
to make heads or tails
of Chameleon's holo‐mask.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.766
Thought maybe you could take
a piece of it to your‐‐

04:25.766 --> 04:29.311
I don't know‐‐ Spider‐lair
and see if you can
uncover a lead.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.605
Ideally pointing to someone
I can arrest.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.441
How do you know you can‐‐
Trust you?

04:34.441 --> 04:37.903
We both want the same thing‐‐
to make this city safe.

04:37.903 --> 04:41.364
Just promise me,
if you find a lead,
you call me first.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.116
Deal.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.455

04:53.919 --> 04:55.295
Miles?

04:55.295 --> 04:58.256
I want you to meet
the Neuro‐Cortex's new home.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.925
I call it the Living Brain.

04:59.925 --> 05:03.386
<i>May I interest you</i>
<i>in a tasty beverage?</i>

05:03.386 --> 05:06.598
Whoa! You gave
the supercomputer a body?

05:08.266 --> 05:11.269
He's well designed,
and strangely polite.

05:11.269 --> 05:16.608
Well, after Doc Ock tried
to steal the Neuro‐Cortex,
Max wanted a way to protect it.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.195
So, working with calculations
given to us
by the Neuro‐Cortex,

05:20.195 --> 05:21.822
we created this.

05:21.822 --> 05:25.075
It also has its own defenses,
including rocket boots.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.576
My touch.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.204
The Neuro‐Cortex helped you
make its own body?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.457
[yawns]
Efficient.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.045
Speaking of new tech,
need your help with this.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.381
Looks like Chameleon
wasn't working alone.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.551
It's a piece of his mask.
Ever seen anything like it?

05:44.010 --> 05:47.597
Huh. It looks like
some kind of meta‐material.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.599
"Meta‐material"?

05:49.599 --> 05:52.352
It bends light waves
to distort what we see.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.438
The fake faces and bodies
Chameleon used
were probably uploaded.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.650
And the meta‐material
gave it three‐dimensional depth.

05:58.650 --> 06:03.363
As for who
could supply this tech,
I got nada.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.074
But watch this.
Living Brain,

06:06.074 --> 06:09.452
who in New York
holds a technology patent
on holo‐meta‐materials?

06:09.452 --> 06:12.581
<i>Subject: Warren, Raymond.</i>

06:12.581 --> 06:15.709
<i>Technology patent:</i>
<i>holo‐meta‐materials.</i>

06:15.709 --> 06:17.419
<i>Fall, last year.</i>

06:17.419 --> 06:20.463
[chuckles]
That‐‐ That's incredible.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.259
So, Raymond Warren.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.261
You think the Jackal's
behind these attacks?

06:26.261 --> 06:28.763
I haven't
seen him in months.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.266
But it could also be someone
stealing his tech.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.976
Wouldn't be
the first time.
[snoring]

06:32.976 --> 06:34.144
[soft thud]
Ow!

06:34.144 --> 06:35.520
Oh, you okay?

06:35.520 --> 06:38.481
You don't look so hot.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.776
What would...
make you think that?

06:41.776 --> 06:43.695
When was the last time
you slept?

06:43.695 --> 06:46.323
If by "slept," you mean

06:46.323 --> 06:48.825
unexpectedly passed out
in aeronautics class...

06:48.825 --> 06:50.994
[sighs]
45 minutes ago.

06:50.994 --> 06:54.623
If you mean a full night's rest,
then probably about a week...

06:54.623 --> 06:56.166
and a half.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.584
Dude, that's insane!

06:57.584 --> 06:59.753
No one can function like that.
Not even you.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.963
Now that you mentioned it,

07:01.963 --> 07:04.382
guess my powers
have kind of been on strike.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.593
And that doesn't
seem odd to you?

07:06.593 --> 07:10.972
I'll sleep
when I catch the Jackal,
or whoever's behind this.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.601
Yeah. It'll be hilarious
when you snore on him.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.604
You need rest, Pete.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.486
No, no, no!
Don't tell her!

07:24.486 --> 07:26.821
So, Pete's come to school
looking a little‐‐

07:26.821 --> 07:30.450
Come on, come on...
Well, you know how
a balloon looks on day five?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.870
"Deflated"?
I was gonna say "sad."

07:33.870 --> 07:35.872
I agree.
He's coming home.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.708

07:41.461 --> 07:44.089
This is so blown

I'm not that tired.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.301
You're not the boss here,

your slumberland pal?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.599

No lab?

08:43.273 --> 08:46.109
Wait! Could it be?

08:46.109 --> 08:49.821
Could this light be a lever

Aw, so cool!

09:27.442 --> 09:31.112
that uploads identities

09:31.112 --> 09:35.200
Just need to download
Chameleon's server files
and decrypt later.

Hopefully there's
a digital trail
or communication,

10:41.766 --> 10:45.436
Uh, thanks, Living Brain.
That was...

10:45.436 --> 10:48.648
[groans]
So much for evidence!

10:48.648 --> 10:50.650
Spidey's gonna kill me.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.485
<i>What is a Spidey?</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:55.655
Spidey, short for "Spider‐Man."

10:55.655 --> 10:59.075
Short for "He Who Will Wring
My Webs For Losing Evidence."

10:59.075 --> 11:01.202
[sighs]
I'm following up
on a lead for him.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.666
<i>[trilling]</i>

11:06.666 --> 11:10.879
<i>Will communication record</i>

11:10.879 --> 11:13.840
Like a call history?
<i>Affirmative.</i>

<i>Accessing root files.</i>

11:18.553 --> 11:22.307
<i>Date range activity available:</i>
<i>one year.</i>

11:22.307 --> 11:24.642
One year?
I'll take last week!

11:24.642 --> 11:26.144

11:31.232 --> 11:33.735
<i>Number of calls: ten.</i>

11:33.735 --> 11:37.864
Someone here was receiving calls
from an Oscorp sub‐basement?

11:37.864 --> 11:41.576
I know Oscorp,
and there's no sub‐basement.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.912
Unless...

11:43.912 --> 11:45.914
it's another supersecret lab!

11:45.914 --> 11:49.542
Living Brain, you may have
just cracked this thing.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.881
[phone vibrating]

11:54.881 --> 11:58.801
Miles?
<i>Sorry to interrupt,</i>
<i>but me and the Living Brain‐‐</i>

11:58.801 --> 12:02.180
Hold up.
What's that sound?
<i>[wind whooshing]</i>

12:02.180 --> 12:04.265
You're riding the flying robot,
aren't you?

12:04.265 --> 12:07.018
Ya get a flying robot,
ya fly it.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.604
But that's not why I called.
Get this.

12:09.604 --> 12:12.106
Living Brain uncovered ten calls
logged from Oscorp

12:12.106 --> 12:14.484
to Jackal's lab
just this past week,

12:14.484 --> 12:16.736
<i>all from some sub‐basement.</i>

12:16.736 --> 12:19.239
A secret lab.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.575
I have to call Harry Osborn.
Be careful, Miles.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.161
[beeping]

12:25.161 --> 12:26.955
<i>[line ringing]</i>
Come on, Harry.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.748
Where are you?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.750
Who could be behind all this?
[beeps]

12:30.750 --> 12:33.127
Maybe Norman's back. No.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.922
Harry?
That doesn't track.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.675
I mean, why now?
And for what?

12:38.675 --> 12:40.551
[groans]
I gotta‐‐

12:40.551 --> 12:41.636
Peter?

12:41.636 --> 12:43.888
Uh... what?

12:43.888 --> 12:45.890
Oh! Oh, where am I?

12:45.890 --> 12:48.935
I must've been, um,
s‐s‐sleepwalking?

12:48.935 --> 12:52.105
With your backpack?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.898
I, uh...
[sheepish chuckle]

12:53.898 --> 12:56.484
I guess I take school
very seriously.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.111
Even in my dreams.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.449
Go to bed, Peter.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.494
I don't wanna see you awake
until tomorrow.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.790
[groans]

13:10.790 --> 13:13.167
You sure there's
no cameras down here?
[thudding footsteps]

13:13.167 --> 13:16.546
Because as cool as all this
superspy stuff is,

13:16.546 --> 13:19.674
getting caught
sneaking around Oscorp
is not on my schedule.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.051
<i>Scans indicate basement clear.</i>

13:22.051 --> 13:25.138
<i>Sub‐basement level ahead.</i>

13:27.181 --> 13:30.059
And it looks like
you've hit your first glitch.

13:30.059 --> 13:34.063
This is a janitor's closet.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.817
Hey. L. B.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.819
Little room, yeah?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.821
You're invading
my space bubble.

13:46.743 --> 13:50.496
An elevator?
Of course the supersecret lab

13:50.496 --> 13:53.499
is under the fake
janitor's closet.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.501
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

13:55.501 --> 13:57.587
Goblin tech?

13:57.587 --> 14:00.798
But who's using this lab,
and how does it all connect?

14:00.798 --> 14:04.010
Chameleon's boss
is running his plans
out of here.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.013
Who does that leave?
Raymond Warren's
still a suspect.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.682
Harry's supposed
to be in Europe.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.393
I guess there's always
the ghost of Norman Osborn.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.897
<i>Norman Osborn:</i>
<i>presumed deceased.</i>

14:15.897 --> 14:18.357

I‐I get reception down here?
Oh, nice!

14:21.360 --> 14:24.405
[beeps]
Spidey, guess what
we just found.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.408
Someone's been running the show
from this hidden Oscorp lab.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.535
<i>All right.</i>
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

14:29.535 --> 14:32.997
Don't.
Dude, take the night off.
L. B. and I got this.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.583
<i>I'll give you</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:39.587

Hmm? Mm‐hmm.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.384
[both gasp]

14:47.095 --> 14:50.098
G‐Gwen!
What are you doing here?

14:50.098 --> 14:54.811
You're awake.
I was bringing you the homework
you left on your desk.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.397
Oh, look.
What a good friend
you have here.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.024
How nice is Gwen?

15:00.024 --> 15:04.028
[halfheartedly]
Yeah. Awesome.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.698
[keyboard clacking]

15:07.698 --> 15:09.867
According to the data
on these files,

15:09.867 --> 15:12.328
this lab's only been in use
since Norman's death.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.248

No. "Harry."

Guess the wrong password
too many times,

15:24.465 --> 15:27.051

could wipe itself.
<i>Affirmative.</i>

15:30.304 --> 15:33.141
<i>Spider‐Man, perhaps?</i>

15:33.141 --> 15:36.269
[sighs]
You're right. I'm backing up
the encrypted files.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.938
We can decode these
back at the lab.

Mini Spider Slayers?

16:06.048 --> 16:09.051
Okay, well, guess it's just up
to you and me, L. B.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.055

16:32.200 --> 16:36.037
Aunt May,

16:36.037 --> 16:40.082
[fake yawn]
Getting pretty sleepy.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.793
Sure thing, honey.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.171
And then, rest.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.090
I'm serious.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.218
We don't have a lot of time.

16:50.218 --> 16:53.846
Not a lot of time...
for science?

16:54.931 --> 16:57.016
Yeah. I can't explain.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.061
Can you cover for me
and keep Aunt May occupied?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.730
What? No way!
Do you know how much trouble‐‐

17:02.730 --> 17:05.942
It's important.
Like, life‐or‐death important.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.527
Just trust me.
As a friend.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.864
How would I

It's all in the wrists.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.079
Wow.
[chuckles]

18:00.079 --> 18:03.541
Thanks for showing me

18:07.962 --> 18:10.715
They're called "wheat cakes."

18:10.715 --> 18:13.884
Right.
That's what I meant.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.971
Aah!

19:26.540 --> 19:28.376

19:28.376 --> 19:30.836
I don't understand.
Living Brain‐‐

19:40.137 --> 19:42.139
Doc Ock?
How did you‐‐

19:42.139 --> 19:44.934
<i>During our last encounter,</i>

19:44.934 --> 19:49.355
when I used the Neuro‐Cortex
to expand
my brain's capabilities,

19:49.355 --> 19:51.941
your attack
forced my mind to escape

19:51.941 --> 19:54.985
via Wi‐Fi into my arms,

19:54.985 --> 19:58.322
downloading my consciousness.

19:58.322 --> 20:02.118
I survived, but was trapped
in a digital realm.

20:02.118 --> 20:07.081
However,
with the resources afforded me
inside the Neuro‐Cortex,

20:07.081 --> 20:10.459
I could still communicate
with the outside world.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.254
And that's how
I hired the Chameleon‐‐

20:13.254 --> 20:18.926
all in order to keep
the low‐level villains in line,
and you occupied.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.262
Wear you down.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.890
I tricked those imbeciles
at Horizon

20:24.890 --> 20:28.060
into creating
a robotic body for me

20:28.060 --> 20:31.313
so I could take
more direct action.

20:31.313 --> 20:35.276
I followed your partner
to my associate's secret lab

20:35.276 --> 20:38.195
in hopes that you
would meet up with him.

20:38.195 --> 20:43.284
Then I led him here,
to where the final piece
of my puzzle resides.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.787
Ha ha ha.
But again and again,

20:46.787 --> 20:49.540
he was too incompetent
to ask for your help,

20:49.540 --> 20:53.335
so I forced his hand.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.587
[beeps]

20:54.587 --> 20:57.465

Why good?

21:06.223 --> 21:08.768
It's nice to know

21:08.768 --> 21:13.355
<i>What benefit would it bring me</i>

21:13.355 --> 21:17.067
<i>After all, I'd only</i>
<i>be hurting myself.</i>

21:17.067 --> 21:19.445

What are you talking about?

21:19.445 --> 21:22.281
<i>All you need to know</i>
<i>is finally,</i>

21:22.281 --> 21:26.410
