01:22.540 --> 01:25.440
<i>I guess I've always
been pretty good with words.</i>

01:26.240 --> 01:28.039
<i>In my line of business</i>

01:28.040 --> 01:31.139
<i>it's as important to be able
to describe what I'm doing</i>

01:31.140 --> 01:33.340
<i>as it is to do what I'm doing.</i>

01:33.540 --> 01:34.940
<i>When to say what.</i>

01:35.340 --> 01:37.440
<i>What words to select.</i>

01:38.040 --> 01:40.540
<i>Some men hate to
hear certain terms.</i>

01:40.840 --> 01:43.740
<i>They can't stand
specific moves and</i>

01:43.940 --> 01:46.640
<i>then they can't live
without others.</i>

01:47.440 --> 01:51.540
<i>It's part of my job to know
where to place my hand,</i>

01:52.540 --> 01:56.840
<i>my lips, my tongue, my leg</i>

01:58.240 --> 02:00.440
<i>and even my thoughts.</i>

02:02.540 --> 02:07.040
<i>What kind of pressure, for
how long, when to stop.</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:13.240
<i>I can become your first kiss...</i>

02:15.240 --> 02:17.539
<i>Or a torn out image
from a Playboy magazine</i>

02:17.540 --> 02:19.840
<i>that you found when you
were nine years old.</i>

02:21.140 --> 02:23.440
<i>Am I your secretary</i>

02:23.640 --> 02:25.240
<i>or am I your daughter?</i>

02:26.440 --> 02:29.640
<i>Maybe I'm your seventh grade
math teacher you always hated.</i>

02:30.340 --> 02:33.140
<i>All I know is that if
I do it just right,</i>

02:33.740 --> 02:37.539
<i>I can become your
living, breathing,</i>

02:37.540 --> 02:42.040
<i>unflinching dream, and
then I can actually</i>

02:43.140 --> 02:44.540
<i>disappear.</i>

02:50.440 --> 02:51.640
Dr. Stewart.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.340
Your last appointment's ready.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.540
All right. Thanks, Julie.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.040
When was your first period?

03:03.540 --> 03:06.340
Uh... I was fourteen.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.640
And what's your occupation?

03:07.839 --> 03:08.839
I'm a dancer.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.540
Oh, yeah? What kind?

03:10.740 --> 03:12.340
Classical ballet.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.440
Oh.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.939
Do you use any form
of contraception?

03:15.940 --> 03:17.140
No.

03:17.340 --> 03:18.739
So you want to have a baby?

03:18.740 --> 03:20.640
No. Not at all. No.

03:20.740 --> 03:22.840
You don't practise safe sex?

03:23.840 --> 03:26.040
I've never had an orgasm.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.140
From intercourse?

03:32.440 --> 03:34.340
We're okay, thanks.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.840
I've barely ever had sex.

03:40.140 --> 03:42.440
There's something
about it I don't get.

03:43.940 --> 03:47.239
Well, an orgasm is simply a
series of muscle contractions.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.739
That's it. It comes from
manipulating the clitoris.

03:49.740 --> 03:54.540
There's nothing mysterious and
there's nothing magic about it.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.739
I'll give you some literature
to take home, okay?

03:56.740 --> 03:57.840
Okay.

03:58.140 --> 03:59.140
You can get dressed now.

03:59.140 --> 04:00.140
Thank you.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.439
Here we are at scene
two where Leporello.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.039
...catalogues Don
Giovanni's conquests.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.940
Country by country. Age by age.
Shape by shape.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.839
Is she sweet or cruel? A
peasant or a princess?

04:17.940 --> 04:19.539
Single? Married?

04:19.540 --> 04:23.540
As he says,"It doesn't really matter.
She wears a skirt."

04:24.640 --> 04:28.640
If we look at the title
of this aria which is?

04:29.740 --> 04:30.740
You.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.840
Madamina, il catalogo e questo.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.540
And what's he saying?

04:34.940 --> 04:35.940
Sir?

04:35.941 --> 04:38.040
"In Italy, six
hundred and forty."

04:38.140 --> 04:40.439
"In Germany, two hundred
and thirty-one."

04:40.440 --> 04:42.540
"Spain, a thousand and three."

04:42.640 --> 04:47.339
Lovers that Don Giovanni
took in Spain alone.

04:47.340 --> 04:49.240
A very busy man.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.040
Yes?

04:52.140 --> 04:55.239
A few of us would like to take
you to dinner. Can you come?

04:55.240 --> 04:57.040
Thank you. I'd love to.

04:57.140 --> 05:01.840
And I'm honoured. But...
Today's my birthday.

05:01.940 --> 05:06.139
And I've got a flight back
home in an hour and a half.

05:06.140 --> 05:09.440
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

05:09.540 --> 05:13.140
<i>Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday.</i>

05:20.440 --> 05:21.540
Hi, how are you?

05:21.640 --> 05:22.940
Did you get a drink?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.340
- Sure.
- Okay.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.940
Oh, presents go in
my office, okay?

05:28.840 --> 05:31.521
You realize I'd have to kill you
if you ever did this to me.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.040
You are a very brave wife.

05:33.140 --> 05:35.540
Oh, I changed my dress, like,
twenty-five times. Is it okay?

05:35.740 --> 05:37.139
You look beautiful.
You look amazing.

05:37.140 --> 05:38.439
- Thank you.
- What time is he supposed to be here?

05:38.440 --> 05:42.440
Well, his flight arrived, like, forty
minutes ago. So any minute now.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.239
Here you go.

05:44.240 --> 05:45.840
Thanks. So?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.140
Michael!

05:50.240 --> 05:52.940
Hey, your dad's going to be here
any minute. Come and join us.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.239
Where did the little boy who used
to run into his mommy's arms go?

06:02.240 --> 06:04.440
His girlfriend is probably going
down on him right about now.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.140
That's a horrible thing
to say to a mother.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.540
He's doing a lot better.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.139
Yeah, he is.

06:10.140 --> 06:11.240
Trina.

06:11.260 --> 06:13.260
Trina. This is Catherine.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.159
Our hostess and my office mate.

06:15.160 --> 06:15.760
Hi.

06:15.860 --> 06:16.860
Hi. Lovely to meet you.

06:16.861 --> 06:18.260
What an amazing house you have.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.560
Thank you.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.460
Oh! That's probably him.
Quiet, everybody!

06:30.960 --> 06:31.960
Hello?

06:32.060 --> 06:33.360
<i>Hey, Catherine.</i>

06:33.960 --> 06:35.360
Hi, honey.

06:35.460 --> 06:36.460
<i>Are you home?</i>

06:36.560 --> 06:38.360
I'm going to be a little late.

06:38.860 --> 06:42.260
Well, I talked to the airline.
They said that your flight landed.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.660
I missed it by a few minutes.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.560
<i>You said you couldn't pick
me up at the airport. So...</i>

06:49.260 --> 06:52.560
Well, do you know
when you'll be home?

06:54.960 --> 06:56.859
The next flight isn't
for two hours.

06:56.860 --> 06:59.360
I don't think I'll be in
before you go to sleep.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.460
I'm so sorry.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.559
<i>Catherine?
Sweetheart.</i>

07:05.560 --> 07:09.160
Um... We'll see you
when you get back then.

07:17.960 --> 07:22.560
Looks like the surprise is on us.
He missed his flight.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.360
We could charter our own flight
and surprise him down there.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.160
I have to admit this
wasn't part of the plan...

07:31.260 --> 07:34.660
...but no reason to
stop the party, right?

08:25.760 --> 08:29.260
Michael! Your friend will
have to go home. It's late.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.476
Hi.

09:26.776 --> 09:27.876
I'm sorry.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.676
Guess I should have told you.

09:29.677 --> 09:31.576
Yeah. You should have.

09:31.676 --> 09:34.075
But then it wouldn't
have been a surprise.

09:34.076 --> 09:37.875
Geez, at my age. You know I try and
ignore my birthdays, Catherine.

09:37.876 --> 09:40.476
- It's so bloody...
- Embarrassing?

09:41.176 --> 09:42.376
Yeah.

09:45.076 --> 09:48.676
Your presents are in my office.
I got you a bottle of Scotch.

09:48.876 --> 09:53.676
I'll be a bit late again tonight. More
boring Curriculum Committee crap.

09:53.776 --> 09:55.775
Yeah.
But you're not late now.

09:55.776 --> 09:57.676
I'll pick up a
coffee on the way.

10:30.476 --> 10:31.576
Morning.

10:33.676 --> 10:37.176
Michael. Your mom's in
the hallway and she just saw me naked.

10:38.276 --> 10:40.776
Jesus, Michael.
This is not okay.

10:41.076 --> 10:42.576
I just got here.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.376
You're lying.

10:45.776 --> 10:47.576
I should probably go home.

10:48.576 --> 10:50.276
Look, Dad knows.

10:50.576 --> 10:52.575
Your father knows about this?

10:52.576 --> 10:56.176
She's... She's in my house all
night and nobody tells me?

10:57.276 --> 10:59.276
Anna. Her name's Anna.

11:01.476 --> 11:03.176
Are you using protection?

11:03.276 --> 11:04.976
We use condoms.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.576
This is not happening
every night.

11:10.776 --> 11:12.176
Understand me?

12:29.176 --> 12:30.576
- See you kids a little later.
- See you later.

12:30.676 --> 12:32.076
Bye, honey. Bye.

12:32.476 --> 12:33.476
Over here.

12:36.076 --> 12:38.076
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:38.176 --> 12:41.175
- You changed your hair.
- Yeah. David hasn't noticed.

12:41.176 --> 12:42.475
Well, that's 'cause
he likes it down.

12:42.476 --> 12:43.276
How do you know?

12:43.376 --> 12:45.537
Well, all men do. They imagine
it wrapped around their?

12:45.576 --> 12:47.176
That's enough, Frank.

12:48.076 --> 12:50.575
Here, please. Sorry, darling.

12:50.576 --> 12:51.576
Hi.

12:52.776 --> 12:55.076
- Hi, David.
- Hey, Frank.

12:55.276 --> 12:56.376
So?

12:57.176 --> 12:58.875
I'm Delia. I'll be your
waitress this evening.

12:58.876 --> 13:00.476
What can I get you to drink?

13:01.976 --> 13:03.476
What do you like
to drink, Delia?

13:03.477 --> 13:04.477
Me?

13:04.876 --> 13:06.976
I like the Maybach Vineyard.

13:07.176 --> 13:11.476
It's a very intense
pure and deep taste.

13:11.576 --> 13:15.675
Oh... Well, I guess I better
have one of those, then.

13:15.676 --> 13:16.676
Good choice.

13:16.776 --> 13:17.776
And you?

13:17.976 --> 13:19.776
I'll have the same.

13:20.376 --> 13:22.776
Where's the bathroom? Frank.

13:24.276 --> 13:26.076
Oh, it's over there.

13:28.676 --> 13:29.676
So...

14:01.976 --> 14:03.276
Are you okay?

14:03.976 --> 14:05.976
Yeah. I'm fine,
thank you.

14:08.976 --> 14:10.776
Can I do anything?

14:15.376 --> 14:17.476
There's no toilet
paper in this stall.

14:17.576 --> 14:18.876
I have some.

14:24.976 --> 14:26.376
Here you go.

14:30.076 --> 14:31.976
Men are such assholes.

14:32.976 --> 14:34.076
Yeah.

14:49.676 --> 14:50.676
Thank you.

14:50.677 --> 14:51.876
You're welcome.

15:04.876 --> 15:06.576
I think you dropped this.

15:08.876 --> 15:10.476
Oh, that's not mine.

15:11.976 --> 15:13.576
Take it anyway.

15:15.776 --> 15:17.076
Why?

15:21.476 --> 15:23.376
I want you to have it.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.376
I have to get back
to my husband.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.675
We're playing "Spot the Hooker."

15:44.676 --> 15:46.976
Mm. That's pleasant.

15:47.176 --> 15:49.675
Mm, this is a nice hotel.
There's a lot of.

15:49.676 --> 15:52.176
...horny and wealthy
out-of-town businessmen.

15:52.276 --> 15:54.976
This is a sexy situation.

15:55.276 --> 15:56.776
And they mix in with
the normal people.

15:56.777 --> 15:58.376
Well, they are normal people.

15:59.576 --> 16:01.676
I don't know how
normal they are.

16:01.976 --> 16:03.675
Have you ever been with one?

16:03.676 --> 16:04.876
Me?

16:06.076 --> 16:07.576
What am I saying?

16:07.776 --> 16:09.276
It's not a habit.

16:13.676 --> 16:16.075
- I liked paying.
- Oh, spare me.

16:16.076 --> 16:20.375
When you want a little dusting and
cleaning with no emotional repercussions?

16:20.376 --> 16:22.876
You want to avoid rejected
women coming after you?

16:22.976 --> 16:24.576
You pay for it.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.376
No?

16:43.376 --> 16:45.475
Did you find that waitress sexy?

16:45.476 --> 16:47.076
Which one?

16:47.776 --> 16:49.876
The one you were flirting with.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.076
Oh come on.
I was being friendly.

16:53.376 --> 16:55.975
People are usually so
rude to service people.

16:55.976 --> 16:59.276
I know. So you like to be
extra nice to make up for it?

17:04.976 --> 17:06.875
Did you run
to catch your plane?

17:06.876 --> 17:07.675
What?

17:07.876 --> 17:11.476
Well, you only missed it by a minute,
you said, so you must have run.

17:11.576 --> 17:13.776
It... it was a few minutes.

17:16.276 --> 17:18.675
Did you intentionally miss
the flight from New York?

17:18.675 --> 17:20.076
What difference does
it make if I...

17:20.175 --> 17:22.476
...if I missed it by
mistake or intentionally?

17:22.576 --> 17:25.575
Well, because you said it was a mistake.
And it was your birthday.

17:25.576 --> 17:27.175
Surprise birthday.

17:27.376 --> 17:30.576
It was neither intentional nor by
mistake, it's just what happened.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.376
Did you go out for a drink?

17:34.776 --> 17:35.876
No.

19:10.876 --> 19:11.876
What would you like?

19:11.976 --> 19:13.776
I'll have a Chardonnay, please.

19:26.976 --> 19:28.776
Do you want to buy me a drink?

19:30.676 --> 19:32.576
What do you like?

19:34.076 --> 19:35.476
What are you having?

19:36.376 --> 19:37.476
Here you are.

19:37.576 --> 19:38.975
Another Chardonnay
for her, please.

19:38.976 --> 19:39.976
Sure.

19:46.276 --> 19:48.876
I don't usually meet with women.

19:50.276 --> 19:55.076
Couples, yes, but...
A single woman...

19:57.976 --> 19:59.276
Thank you.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.276
I think my husband
would like you.

20:05.676 --> 20:07.575
Do you choose his women for him?

20:07.576 --> 20:08.576
No.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.676
- He can't come in himself?
- No.

20:13.676 --> 20:14.876
Why not?

20:18.376 --> 20:19.676
What's your name?

20:21.876 --> 20:23.176
It's Chloe.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.876
My husband's cheating on me.

20:30.576 --> 20:32.376
At least I think he is.

20:36.676 --> 20:38.676
I want to find out.

20:39.676 --> 20:45.376
See what he does if you
present yourself to him.

20:48.576 --> 20:51.176
Most of my clients are married.

20:51.476 --> 20:53.276
He's not the client.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.576
What does he look like?

21:05.476 --> 21:08.476
He's tall, strong...

21:09.276 --> 21:11.876
He has chestnut hair.

21:13.376 --> 21:15.076
He's very handsome.

21:16.876 --> 21:21.176
David usually has
lunch at the Cafe Diplomatico.

21:22.076 --> 21:24.576
And he's almost
always reading the newspaper.

21:25.476 --> 21:27.976
If he asks what
I do for a living...

21:28.076 --> 21:29.776
...what do you want me to say?

21:30.276 --> 21:33.676
Say you're a student, studying
to be an interpreter.

21:33.976 --> 21:35.976
Do you speak any
other languages?

21:36.276 --> 21:37.976
Some Japanese.

21:38.076 --> 21:39.376
Okay.

21:45.676 --> 21:46.876
Excuse me.

21:47.776 --> 21:49.875
I'm sorry. Can I
borrow your sugar?

21:49.876 --> 21:50.976
Sure.

21:52.376 --> 21:53.576
Thank you.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.276
Did you not recognize me?

22:44.276 --> 22:45.876
I wasn't sure.

22:58.776 --> 23:00.076
I saw him.

23:01.776 --> 23:04.676
Just like you said, he had his
newspapers right there and.

23:04.776 --> 23:07.076
I went up asked him
for his sugar.

23:07.576 --> 23:09.776
And he pretended to
read his newspapers.

23:10.276 --> 23:17.076
And he got up and came over to me
and asked me if I was a student.

23:17.176 --> 23:21.976
And I said that I was studying language,
like you told me to, Japanese.

23:23.376 --> 23:26.475
And he asked me if I could
say something in Japanese...

23:26.476 --> 23:32.276
which made me blush. And I ended
up just saying, "Konichiwa."

23:33.276 --> 23:35.876
And then he asked me what my
name was and I said Chloe.

23:36.576 --> 23:39.276
Okay. That's okay.

23:44.276 --> 23:45.376
Nothing happened.

23:45.476 --> 23:48.176
Except that he approached
you and he spoke to you.

23:48.276 --> 23:50.276
Pretty girl, cafe...

23:50.376 --> 23:54.076
He barely flirted.
He was just friendly.

23:57.876 --> 23:59.476
He's cute.

24:08.076 --> 24:09.876
How do you do this?

24:24.528 --> 24:27.328
I try to find something
to love in everybody.

24:28.928 --> 24:30.828
Even if it's a small thing.

24:34.228 --> 24:36.628
Something about the
way someone smiles.

24:39.028 --> 24:41.028
There's always something.

24:41.328 --> 24:42.728
There has to be.

24:44.928 --> 24:49.328
I try to make myself generous.
I do things I don't want to do.

24:51.128 --> 24:55.128
I think about what
not to criticize.

24:58.628 --> 25:00.428
And the strangest
things come back to me.

25:00.528 --> 25:01.628
Like?

25:01.828 --> 25:02.928
You.

25:04.228 --> 25:05.428
Me?

25:07.528 --> 25:08.628
Yeah.

25:10.228 --> 25:13.128
Yeah, people like you
walk into my life.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.228
The money's in the envelope.

25:41.028 --> 25:44.128
I want to do this one more
time just to see what he does.

25:44.928 --> 25:46.828
And then we'll stop, okay?

25:49.328 --> 25:50.728
Okay.

26:20.328 --> 26:24.028
<i>Look, Michael, it's not
like we're engaged. Okay?</i>

26:24.228 --> 26:28.028
<i>If there are other guys,
it's got nothing to do with you.</i>

26:28.528 --> 26:33.828
Alright. I need to see you, okay?
This... This is weird.

26:34.128 --> 26:35.527
<i>You are seeing me.</i>

26:35.528 --> 26:39.428
I mean... I mean face-to-face.
This is... This is fucked.

26:39.528 --> 26:43.128
<i>I know but, look, we are face-to-face.
Let's just...</i>

26:43.428 --> 26:46.127
Look, people don't just break
up with each other out of nowhere, okay?

26:46.128 --> 26:47.678
I know there's someone else.

26:47.679 --> 26:51.928
<i>I just... I don't think that...
Graduation's coming up, you know, Michael.</i>

26:52.028 --> 26:56.128
<i>I just... I don't want to feel
tied down by you or anything.</i>

27:00.128 --> 27:01.428
Fuck! Mom!

27:18.928 --> 27:20.428
Who were you on with?

27:20.628 --> 27:24.628
One of my students.
We were done anyway.

27:25.528 --> 27:27.828
Our little boy's being dumped.

27:28.628 --> 27:30.228
How do you know?

27:32.728 --> 27:34.227
I don't know what
bothers me more...

27:34.228 --> 27:36.428
...that he's sleeping with
her or that he isn't.

27:37.928 --> 27:39.728
Did you speak to him?

27:39.828 --> 27:41.528
He doesn't talk to me.

27:43.028 --> 27:47.328
Catherine, this is
going to be okay.

27:47.628 --> 27:49.928
I don't know how to be
his mother anymore.

27:49.929 --> 27:51.728
He's going to be fine.

27:51.928 --> 27:53.828
He's in therapy.
He's going to be?

27:53.928 --> 27:57.328
Did you know his girlfriend
was sleeping over?

28:01.728 --> 28:04.028
Come on. You remember
what it was like.

28:05.528 --> 28:09.428
Hey! What do you say we...
what do you say we taste this?

28:10.128 --> 28:12.028
No. I... I have a headache.

28:12.128 --> 28:14.028
- Well, take an Advil.
- I did.

28:14.328 --> 28:15.628
Take two.

28:23.128 --> 28:24.128
Oh, boy.

28:29.928 --> 28:31.528
Oh, nectar.

28:36.728 --> 28:38.428
Thank you for the scotch.

28:38.728 --> 28:41.328
And thank you for
the fecking party.

28:47.528 --> 28:49.128
I love your smile.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.828
No, you don't.

28:55.828 --> 28:58.828
When did we stop picking each
other up at the airport?

29:01.528 --> 29:03.128
I don't know.

29:04.328 --> 29:07.328
And waiting for each
other at the gate?

29:08.628 --> 29:09.628
Eh?

29:09.629 --> 29:12.928
I'm trying to remember when...
when it happened.

29:13.228 --> 29:14.828
When they upped security.

29:14.928 --> 29:16.428
I'm serious.

29:18.828 --> 29:22.228
I don't know.
We just got so busy.

29:32.528 --> 29:33.828
What?

29:34.828 --> 29:39.527
I've got thirty papers to read
and comment on by tomorrow.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.927
Yeah. You should... you
should get to work.

29:41.928 --> 29:42.828
Are you okay?

29:42.928 --> 29:44.828
Yeah, of course.

30:05.828 --> 30:07.228
<i>Yeah, Dad...</i>

30:08.828 --> 30:11.228
It's kind of crazy,
you know, when...

30:11.328 --> 30:13.728
when and I met, it was like.

30:13.828 --> 30:17.228
I've never really felt that way about
anyone. She totally just kind of...

30:17.328 --> 30:20.527
I mean, you... Dad, did you
feel that way like about Mom?

30:20.528 --> 30:23.828
Like, was that how it
was when you guys met?

30:24.028 --> 30:27.428
I used to make you tell me that story over
and over again about how you two met.

30:28.128 --> 30:30.728
She was the most beautiful
woman you'd ever seen.

30:30.828 --> 30:33.348
That she was
everything that you weren't...

31:16.228 --> 31:17.228
There you are.

31:17.328 --> 31:19.928
Hey! They're amazing.

31:22.828 --> 31:25.628
Sorry. I think... I think I
was going through some...

31:25.728 --> 31:29.928
...some weird form of insecurity
or a mid-life crisis or something.

31:30.028 --> 31:32.627
...but let's just forget
this whole thing happened.

31:32.628 --> 31:34.128
Well, I already did.

31:34.228 --> 31:34.928
Forget it?

31:34.929 --> 31:36.828
No. I already saw him.

31:37.128 --> 31:38.828
You saw him? Where?

31:38.928 --> 31:42.278
I was at the cafe and I... I
approached him like you asked me to...

31:42.279 --> 31:43.728
...and we went to lunch.

31:43.828 --> 31:45.828
You... wait, you had
lunch with my husband?

31:45.928 --> 31:49.228
Yeah, it was a picnic, kind of.

31:49.528 --> 31:51.628
We bought some sandwiches.

31:51.728 --> 31:54.527
And then I asked him
about his teaching.

31:54.528 --> 31:57.328
...and he started talking
about his music.

31:58.428 --> 32:01.928
And he kind of stared at me.

32:04.628 --> 32:06.328
And then what?

32:09.028 --> 32:11.328
And then he asked me
if he could kiss me.

32:12.928 --> 32:14.928
I didn't ask you to do that.

32:15.228 --> 32:18.628
But then he said he could not
kiss me because he's married.

32:19.928 --> 32:21.527
You see? At first
he was hesitant.

32:21.528 --> 32:22.828
At first?

32:26.528 --> 32:30.428
And then he asked me if
there was somewhere.

32:30.528 --> 32:34.428
...he could kiss me where
no one would see us.

32:34.528 --> 32:35.628
And...

32:37.028 --> 32:39.528
I said to him that we
should go to Allen Gardens.

32:39.628 --> 32:44.328
You know that place down the street
with the big... Big greenhouse?

32:50.728 --> 32:52.728
Do you want me to stop?

32:53.328 --> 32:54.628
No.

32:58.628 --> 33:04.228
We walked through this big long
corridor with all these exotic flowers.

33:06.928 --> 33:08.728
<i>There was nobody around.</i>

33:10.228 --> 33:12.228
<i>I love Allen Gardens.</i>

33:13.228 --> 33:14.928
It's always so warm.

33:15.228 --> 33:17.928
<i>And the air just
feels so beautiful.</i>

33:18.728 --> 33:21.128
<i>It's like you're suddenly
in a different country.</i>

33:22.828 --> 33:26.228
I knew there's a place in the back,
where they keep tools and stuff.

33:27.428 --> 33:29.428
No one ever goes
to that section.

33:30.428 --> 33:32.928
<i>It's like a
secret hiding place.</i>

33:34.328 --> 33:36.727
He brought his mouth
up to my lips.

33:36.728 --> 33:39.028
...and we hovered there
for a long time.

33:41.428 --> 33:43.527
I could feel he was excited
through his pants.

33:43.528 --> 33:44.728
That's enough.

33:53.328 --> 33:55.727
You were supposed to
meet up with my husband.

33:55.728 --> 33:58.528
...and see what he did and
then report back to me.

34:02.728 --> 34:04.728
I don't really know
what you want.

34:04.828 --> 34:07.628
I shouldn't have involved you in this.
I made a mistake.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.228
Damn it!

34:30.828 --> 34:33.627
God, I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to get out of this spot.

34:33.628 --> 34:35.828
Is your... is your bumper okay?

34:37.228 --> 34:40.128
I'm sorry. Would you mind
moving up just a little?

34:54.128 --> 34:55.228
Ow!

35:01.528 --> 35:04.027
Do you carry that bag
with you in the car?

35:04.028 --> 35:06.528
Uh huh. You never know
when you might need it.

35:07.928 --> 35:09.527
Actually, let's not cut it.
Sorry.

35:09.528 --> 35:10.528
I'm...

35:11.628 --> 35:13.728
I'm going to take them off.

35:27.428 --> 35:30.528
Just hold that to stop
the bleeding, okay?

35:40.428 --> 35:41.828
I'm sorry.

35:50.628 --> 35:52.127
You think it will scar?

35:52.128 --> 35:55.228
No. It shouldn't.

36:05.028 --> 36:13.028
We were hidden, deep in this
forest of exotic plants and trees.

36:15.628 --> 36:17.978
And we could hear
voices in the distance.

36:17.979 --> 36:20.828
...but we were pretty sure no
one could actually see us.

36:22.028 --> 36:26.328
And I pushed my hand down
his pants and felt him.

36:36.828 --> 36:40.628
And then I... I moved
my hand lightly on him.

36:47.428 --> 36:48.828
Right.

36:52.928 --> 36:54.828
And then I kept doing this.

36:55.728 --> 36:58.628
Moving my hand on
him in his pants.

37:00.328 --> 37:03.828
And he said to me,"I can't come. I
can't come. I have to go to work."

37:04.928 --> 37:06.528
But I didn't stop.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.328
And then I bit his tongue.

37:14.228 --> 37:17.628
And then... just then
he came in my hand.

37:19.828 --> 37:21.228
And then what?

37:21.428 --> 37:23.828
And then he had to go to
work so he walked away.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.428
I don't want to be rude.

37:47.428 --> 37:49.628
Uh... I want you...

37:49.828 --> 37:51.228
I want you to be clean.

37:51.328 --> 37:52.928
I mean, I... I know
you are clean...

37:53.128 --> 37:54.728
Oh, I... No, I...
I've got tests...

37:54.729 --> 37:57.327
All of them, like HIV, STDs...

37:57.328 --> 38:00.027
...and then show me the results.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.728
Okay. Yeah.

40:20.728 --> 40:22.128
Can I help you?

40:22.628 --> 40:24.027
I'm looking for Catherine.

40:24.028 --> 40:26.728
Dr. Stewart is in with a patient.
When's your appointment?

40:26.928 --> 40:29.528
I don't have one.
She and I are friends.

40:30.828 --> 40:33.228
Okay. Well, she
should be out soon.

40:34.028 --> 40:35.528
Would you like to sit down?

40:35.628 --> 40:36.628
Okay.

40:53.028 --> 40:54.328
Hi, Michael.

40:55.928 --> 40:57.728
Your mom's still
in with a patient.

40:57.828 --> 40:59.028
I just need to pick up my tux.

40:59.128 --> 41:02.328
It's in her office.
Exciting recital tonight, huh?

41:02.728 --> 41:03.828
Yeah.

41:05.128 --> 41:07.128
I need to copy some music.

41:10.828 --> 41:12.628
Your mom is Dr. Stewart?

41:14.528 --> 41:16.828
My mother's your gynaecologist?

41:45.728 --> 41:47.728
You look like her.

41:48.328 --> 41:49.828
Me?

41:50.228 --> 41:52.427
No, I don't... I don't think so.

41:52.428 --> 41:54.528
Yeah. The same
look in your eyes.

41:54.828 --> 42:02.028
I mean, not really the colour
or the shape but... The look.

42:03.928 --> 42:05.928
And your lips, too.

42:11.928 --> 42:13.728
I'm Chloe Sweeney.

42:13.828 --> 42:16.428
Oh, Michael Stewart.

42:16.628 --> 42:18.128
Nice to meet you.

42:18.928 --> 42:20.428
Are you a musician?

42:21.428 --> 42:22.727
No, it's just...

42:22.728 --> 42:24.828
...just what you're
supposed to do, I guess.

42:25.028 --> 42:27.128
Study music.

42:28.828 --> 42:32.328
I wish someone had
have given me lessons.

42:32.628 --> 42:34.328
I love music.

42:35.328 --> 42:36.828
Classical?

42:38.628 --> 42:40.628
Raised by Swans.

42:42.828 --> 42:45.328
You never heard of the
band Raised by Swans?

42:45.828 --> 42:47.528
Um, no.

42:48.228 --> 42:49.928
You'd like them.

42:50.628 --> 42:53.128
I think you'd really like them.

43:01.028 --> 43:02.527
That's it for my
appointments, right?

43:02.528 --> 43:03.828
Uh huh.

43:04.028 --> 43:06.028
Mannie's Motors called.
Your tune-up's finished.

43:06.128 --> 43:06.728
Okay.

43:06.729 --> 43:08.127
Alicia called about
lunch at two.

43:08.128 --> 43:08.828
Right. Right.

43:08.829 --> 43:11.427
And your son is in the
back making copies.

43:11.428 --> 43:12.628
Oh.

43:14.028 --> 43:15.328
Hi, Doctor.

43:17.028 --> 43:18.928
Here you go. Full work up.

43:21.328 --> 43:23.928
Okay. Thank you for
bringing them by.

43:25.328 --> 43:26.928
Can I talk to you?

43:27.428 --> 43:31.428
No, I can't. I'm jammed.
If you could call and...

43:34.428 --> 43:35.928
Yeah. Quickly.

43:42.828 --> 43:44.528
That's my son.

43:48.028 --> 43:49.128
You didn't speak
to him, did you?

43:49.228 --> 43:51.628
I came to tell you
about this afternoon.

43:51.728 --> 43:53.428
It's today.

43:54.128 --> 43:55.728
Today?

43:55.928 --> 43:58.928
Yeah. After lunch. Okay?

44:09.328 --> 44:10.728
You got my tux?

44:13.328 --> 44:14.428
Thanks.

44:15.128 --> 44:16.427
I'm excited.

44:16.428 --> 44:17.628
About what?

44:17.828 --> 44:20.127
About tonight.
About seeing you play.

44:20.128 --> 44:22.728
I put a... I put a good
luck note in your jacket.

44:22.828 --> 44:24.028
Okay.

44:26.228 --> 44:27.928
Thanks, Mom.

44:28.128 --> 44:29.428
You said it.

44:36.528 --> 44:38.528
She says she lies
in bed night after night.

44:38.628 --> 44:40.628
...and tries to imagine a life
where she only sees her kids.

44:40.728 --> 44:43.427
...every other week and she
says that she can't do it.

44:43.428 --> 44:45.828
So she's staying with him.

44:45.928 --> 44:48.528
At this point, apparently,
she's just surviving.

44:48.828 --> 44:51.228
Maybe she'll ask him if
he'll go to couples therapy...

45:09.128 --> 45:10.428
Who was that?

45:11.128 --> 45:12.328
A patient.

45:12.428 --> 45:13.927
What's going on with you?

45:13.928 --> 45:15.128
Nothing.

45:17.428 --> 45:22.628
Listen, I understand. Especially
with missing flights, busy on his?

45:22.728 --> 45:24.627
David is fine. We worked it out.

45:24.628 --> 45:26.428
He missed his
flight, that's all.

45:26.429 --> 45:28.428
He's not the most organized
man in the world.

45:28.429 --> 45:30.727
No. I'm talking about you.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.228
Who have you met?

45:32.728 --> 45:36.328
Me? No. No.
Oh, God, no.

45:37.528 --> 45:40.028
You have affair
written all over you.

45:42.128 --> 45:46.528
I have this pregnant patient who
panics every time she gets a kick.

45:46.628 --> 45:51.028
...or a cramp because, really, she's
terrified about being a mother.

45:51.328 --> 45:54.228
So I've decided to hold
her hand through this.

45:54.528 --> 45:57.078
But I really need...
I need to call her back.

45:57.079 --> 45:58.428
We're finished, right?

45:58.528 --> 45:59.828
- Uh huh.
- Okay.

45:59.928 --> 46:02.028
Thanks for lunch. Bye.

46:40.428 --> 46:41.989
Hello?

47:15.428 --> 47:17.328
No. No. Not there.

47:20.028 --> 47:21.928
Sit in that chair.

47:31.528 --> 47:33.028
Okay...

47:34.728 --> 47:36.228
Go ahead.

47:40.028 --> 47:42.228
We met in the park again.

47:44.728 --> 47:47.028
This time he didn't
bring sandwiches.

47:47.128 --> 47:49.028
We checked into this room.

47:51.428 --> 47:55.527
He put on the news,
pretended to be interested.

47:55.528 --> 47:57.528
I sat down next to him.

47:59.828 --> 48:04.228
He turned and looked at me.
Kissed me.

48:06.128 --> 48:08.128
Whispered, "Let's fuck."

48:11.128 --> 48:12.628
Jesus.

48:19.728 --> 48:24.128
He couldn't get it up.
We tried a few times.

48:24.828 --> 48:26.928
He was really embarrassed.

48:27.028 --> 48:31.027
But I told him it didn't really
matter, that I liked it.

48:31.028 --> 48:35.028
That it meant that we could
just wait a little bit longer.

48:35.828 --> 48:39.428
And at that point he was fully dressed.
I was completely naked.

48:47.728 --> 48:49.828
Does this turn you on?

48:54.528 --> 48:56.728
He wanted to stay dressed.

48:57.528 --> 49:00.528
He sat right over
there on that bench.

49:04.528 --> 49:07.028
He told me to get
between his legs.

49:14.028 --> 49:18.128
I put him in my mouth
and then he got hard.

49:24.128 --> 49:25.928
Are you okay?

49:28.028 --> 49:30.328
I think I'm coming
down with something.

49:33.128 --> 49:34.728
Did you see a doctor?

49:35.228 --> 49:39.728
No. It's nothing.
I'm taking zinc.

49:44.028 --> 49:46.228
Did he come in your mouth?

49:47.828 --> 49:48.828
No.

49:51.128 --> 49:54.228
I pulled him out of me,
put a rubber on him.

49:56.228 --> 49:58.028
I straddled him.

50:02.728 --> 50:10.128
And... He came almost immediately
after he entered me.

50:14.328 --> 50:16.428
I put my tits in his face.

50:16.528 --> 50:17.528
Okay...

50:23.128 --> 50:25.628
Oh, well...

50:50.428 --> 50:52.228
Do you
want to count it?

50:53.828 --> 50:55.328
No, it's okay.

51:44.728 --> 51:46.728
Do you think the
zinc really works?

51:47.028 --> 51:49.528
If you take it early
enough, yeah.

52:01.028 --> 52:03.028
What kind of perfume is that?

52:06.428 --> 52:07.628
It's lotion.

52:10.128 --> 52:11.428
Here.

52:19.028 --> 52:21.328
We used to go
everything together.

52:22.928 --> 52:25.028
We couldn't stand to be apart.

52:26.328 --> 52:28.428
Even for an hour.

52:29.428 --> 52:32.027
We'd sit and wait for each
other outside of appointments.

52:32.028 --> 52:36.228
...just loving those moments of waiting until
we could finally see each other again.

52:37.028 --> 52:38.728
Touch each other.

52:40.228 --> 52:42.528
I loved his hands.

52:43.428 --> 52:45.828
They used to grab me everywhere.

52:46.728 --> 52:48.928
It used to be that way.

52:49.628 --> 52:51.628
I used to be younger.

52:54.528 --> 52:56.728
Have you ever had
that with anyone?

53:00.928 --> 53:02.428
Yeah.

53:06.528 --> 53:08.328
Do you still love him?

53:10.628 --> 53:12.228
I don't know.

53:22.428 --> 53:24.228
And one more thing.

53:27.928 --> 53:30.428
He said it's the first
time he's ever done this.

53:30.528 --> 53:32.128
Well, that's a line.

53:38.328 --> 53:40.328
Jesus.

53:41.128 --> 53:44.728
I don't know whether to be
relieved or just go hang myself.

53:48.728 --> 53:50.128
Fuck.

54:20.928 --> 54:22.428
I can't... I can't...

55:41.528 --> 55:42.828
Bravo!

55:46.528 --> 55:47.728
Bravo!

56:06.828 --> 56:08.228
Congratulations.

56:08.428 --> 56:09.728
On?

56:10.828 --> 56:12.528
Your beautiful son.

56:16.028 --> 56:17.428
He's you.

56:17.628 --> 56:20.228
No, he's you.
You know that.

56:24.128 --> 56:25.728
What is that?

56:25.828 --> 56:27.528
You're wearing perfume.

56:29.228 --> 56:30.728
It's lotion.

56:31.128 --> 56:32.428
I like it.

56:35.228 --> 56:36.928
Professor Stewart!

56:37.628 --> 56:39.728
Madeleine.
How are you?

56:39.828 --> 56:40.828
Good.

58:17.028 --> 58:18.728
How does he do it?

58:19.628 --> 58:20.828
What?

58:21.428 --> 58:23.028
Touch you.

58:25.728 --> 58:27.128
Aw, God...

01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:42.528
You can stop here.

01:00:45.628 --> 01:00:47.428
- This is where you live?
- Uh huh.

01:00:47.528 --> 01:00:49.228
Which one is your house?

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:51.028
It's back there.

01:00:52.628 --> 01:00:54.528
This is to take her home.

01:01:00.128 --> 01:01:02.428
Please don't see
my husband again.

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:06.828
Hold on. I...

01:01:07.528 --> 01:01:09.528
I have something for you.

01:01:20.228 --> 01:01:23.328
I want... I want
you to have this.

01:01:23.428 --> 01:01:24.927
No. I told you, that's yours.

01:01:24.928 --> 01:01:28.528
No. This is... this
used to be my mother's.

01:01:29.628 --> 01:01:31.828
And I want you to have it.

01:01:34.728 --> 01:01:37.128
Did you drop this on purpose?

01:01:43.028 --> 01:01:45.228
I wanted to talk to you.

01:01:51.328 --> 01:01:53.028
I have to go.

01:01:56.028 --> 01:01:58.028
Do you want to see me again?

01:02:00.628 --> 01:02:04.327
I don't know. I... We work
in the same neighbourhood.

01:02:04.328 --> 01:02:06.628
I'll see you on the
street, right?

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:09.778
You'll see me on the street?

01:02:09.779 --> 01:02:11.928
I didn't mean it that way.
I mean, it just...

01:02:12.928 --> 01:02:15.128
That came out wrong.

01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:18.928
I'm just... I'm exhausted.

01:03:13.528 --> 01:03:15.128
Who is it?

01:03:20.928 --> 01:03:22.928
Are you in love?

01:03:24.628 --> 01:03:26.727
If I were, would it
make a difference?

01:03:26.728 --> 01:03:28.828
Of course it would
make a difference.

01:03:28.928 --> 01:03:30.227
Are you in love?

01:03:30.228 --> 01:03:31.927
You've been out all night.
Now I'm under interrogation.

01:03:31.928 --> 01:03:34.228
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I forgot.

01:03:34.328 --> 01:03:36.028
You're a lot more
discreet with your women.

01:03:36.128 --> 01:03:38.528
You don't come home late 'cause
you have it down with them.

01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:41.027
I like women. I appreciate their
beauty, their intelligence.

01:03:41.028 --> 01:03:42.578
That does not mean
I'm screwing them.

01:03:42.579 --> 01:03:45.728
How do you think I feel when
I come into your office.

01:03:45.828 --> 01:03:47.927
...and you're instant
messaging with a student?

01:03:47.928 --> 01:03:51.027
I make myself available to my students.
That's how I gain their trust!

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:52.827
- That's how I teach!
- Oh, God!

01:03:52.828 --> 01:03:54.527
- You won't admit it.
- Admit what?

01:03:54.528 --> 01:03:59.028
Do you know that you flirt with every single
goddamn woman you come into contact with?

01:03:59.128 --> 01:04:01.027
For all I know you could
be fucking them all!

01:04:01.028 --> 01:04:02.528
I'm not having an affair!

01:04:02.628 --> 01:04:04.028
Stop it!

01:04:06.028 --> 01:04:07.528
Go to your room!

01:04:07.628 --> 01:04:09.278
You're telling me
to go to my room?

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:11.328
Michael, just leave us
alone for a minute.

01:04:11.428 --> 01:04:12.927
You can't control me!

01:04:12.928 --> 01:04:14.328
Michael! That's enough.

01:04:14.428 --> 01:04:16.828
I can't wait to get
the fuck out of here.

01:05:00.828 --> 01:05:02.728
I was held up at the hospital.

01:05:03.228 --> 01:05:04.228
Are you okay?

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.128
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:09.428 --> 01:05:13.028
There was an urgent call from Mrs. Beatrice.
She's concerned about her hormone therapy.

01:05:13.128 --> 01:05:13.928
Okay.

01:05:13.929 --> 01:05:16.128
Mrs. Car has a yeast
infection again.

01:05:16.228 --> 01:05:19.128
Uh huh. Okay.

01:05:19.628 --> 01:05:24.028
And these just came for you.
And there's an urgent e-mail as well.

01:05:30.128 --> 01:05:31.628
I'll be right there.

01:05:35.228 --> 01:05:36.828
I'm so sorry.

01:05:42.428 --> 01:05:44.228
Oh my God.

01:06:01.528 --> 01:06:02.627
<i>This is Chloe.</i>

01:06:02.628 --> 01:06:03.928
Where are you?

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:07.428
<i>I'm in your waiting room.
Didn't you see me when you came in?</i>

01:06:17.828 --> 01:06:19.128
Smell them.

01:06:20.728 --> 01:06:22.228
What are you doing?

01:06:24.928 --> 01:06:26.428
I'm sorry.

01:06:32.428 --> 01:06:33.828
No.

01:06:34.928 --> 01:06:36.328
I'm sorry.

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:40.928
Why?

01:06:44.828 --> 01:06:46.328
You're amazing.

01:06:48.728 --> 01:06:50.728
You're so beautiful.

01:06:56.628 --> 01:06:59.828
But we've taken this as
far as I want it to go.

01:07:06.328 --> 01:07:10.428
I liked it. Last night.

01:07:14.028 --> 01:07:16.728
Yeah, I liked it, too.
I can't say that I didn't.

01:07:19.928 --> 01:07:21.928
I don't want this to be over.

01:07:22.928 --> 01:07:26.228
And I don't think that you
want it to be, either.

01:07:26.229 --> 01:07:27.628
You want money?

01:07:30.928 --> 01:07:32.728
It's not about money.

01:07:35.628 --> 01:07:39.928
You accepted money from me, so when
did this not become about money?

01:07:54.428 --> 01:07:56.028
Okay. Now...

01:07:58.528 --> 01:08:00.828
This should take
care of everything.

01:08:07.428 --> 01:08:12.228
This isn't a business thing.
This was so real and you know that.

01:08:12.328 --> 01:08:14.727
What about last night?
I touched you and I?

01:08:14.728 --> 01:08:16.228
How do I get through to you?

01:08:16.328 --> 01:08:21.627
This business transaction, which...
which is what this was, is over.

01:08:24.228 --> 01:08:27.728
Now, please, you have
got to get out of here.

01:08:33.228 --> 01:08:34.428
Come on.

01:08:38.627 --> 01:08:39.828
Come on.

01:08:44.428 --> 01:08:46.228
I'm so sorry...

01:09:25.228 --> 01:09:26.828
Right here! Right here!

01:09:26.928 --> 01:09:28.888
Come on,
right here. Pass it! Pass!

01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:33.327
- Come on!
- Stewart!

01:09:33.328 --> 01:09:35.827
- Two minutes, tripping.
- You gotta be kidding me!

01:09:35.828 --> 01:09:36.928
Shit!

01:09:42.127 --> 01:09:43.228
Hey!

01:09:44.328 --> 01:09:45.528
Hey.

01:09:47.127 --> 01:09:50.827
I bought you that CD that we talked
about... Raised by Swans. Swans.

01:09:50.828 --> 01:09:52.228
Thanks.

01:09:54.127 --> 01:09:55.528
What?

01:09:57.528 --> 01:10:02.128
I...I downloaded all
their albums already.

01:10:02.728 --> 01:10:07.128
But you didn't download the
case or the artwork...

01:10:07.828 --> 01:10:12.628
...or the CD that you can keep
forever and hold in your hands.

01:10:19.728 --> 01:10:21.728
I hate the Internet.

01:10:22.928 --> 01:10:24.727
Nothing is private.

01:10:24.728 --> 01:10:27.828
Nothing is real. Like this...
Me meeting you here.

01:10:28.028 --> 01:10:30.028
The penalty box.

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:33.228
Do you have a page?

01:10:34.628 --> 01:10:35.928
No.

01:10:37.728 --> 01:10:40.328
Yes. Yeah.

01:10:40.728 --> 01:10:42.528
I know. I saw it.

01:10:42.728 --> 01:10:45.128
That's how I knew that
you had a game today.

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:47.028
Nice picture.

01:10:47.328 --> 01:10:49.327
I don't really photograph well.

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:53.228
Yeah, you do. I like that
picture of your mom.

01:10:53.328 --> 01:10:56.028
There's... There's not a
picture of my mom on there.

01:10:56.228 --> 01:10:59.228
Isn't she in the background
when you're getting that award?

01:10:59.428 --> 01:11:01.928
Yeah, but she's out of focus.

01:11:02.128 --> 01:11:04.028
Yeah, she is.

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:07.828
I notice everything.

01:11:10.028 --> 01:11:11.528
I'll see you.

01:11:24.428 --> 01:11:27.728
<i>♪ We were young. ♪</i>

01:11:28.828 --> 01:11:30.727
<i>♪ Like the universe... ♪</i>

01:11:30.728 --> 01:11:31.928
Michael?

01:11:33.128 --> 01:11:36.428
<i>♪ Like our mother's work. ♪</i>

01:11:36.928 --> 01:11:39.428
<i>♪ Like these words... ♪</i>

01:11:42.728 --> 01:11:44.028
Michael?

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:15.127
- Mom?
- Jesus!

01:12:15.128 --> 01:12:16.728
Where'd you get this music?

01:12:16.928 --> 01:12:19.328
- From the store.
- Did you talk to that girl?

01:12:19.428 --> 01:12:20.727
- What girl?
- In my office?

01:12:20.728 --> 01:12:22.528
What are you talking about?

01:12:22.628 --> 01:12:24.328
Is she here? Where is she?

01:12:24.528 --> 01:12:27.428
What the fuck are you do... Are you
fucking insane?

01:12:33.628 --> 01:12:35.628
I don't know. I don't...

01:12:35.828 --> 01:12:37.528
I don't know. Oh, my God.

01:12:37.628 --> 01:12:41.228
Ah, I don't know.
I'm sorry, honey. I'm...

01:12:48.328 --> 01:12:50.928
<i>I told you
not to call my husband.</i>

01:12:51.428 --> 01:12:54.828
I didn't call your husband.
He called me.

01:12:55.128 --> 01:13:00.928
I...I wouldn't... I would
never contact him.

01:13:02.728 --> 01:13:06.428
He... when he called it
was like there was...

01:13:06.628 --> 01:13:08.528
...it wasn't about sex.

01:13:10.028 --> 01:13:13.028
It was something
emotional vulnerable.

01:13:14.228 --> 01:13:17.228
<i>He said that when
he touches you...</i>

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:21.328
...he feels like
he's cheating on me.

01:13:22.128 --> 01:13:23.728
<i>Isn't that crazy?</i>

01:13:25.728 --> 01:13:27.128
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

01:13:28.828 --> 01:13:30.228
Catherine?

01:13:34.228 --> 01:13:38.828
Meet me in an hour at
the Cafe Diplomatico.

01:13:50.428 --> 01:13:51.428
What's going on?

01:13:51.528 --> 01:13:52.528
You want to order?

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:53.528
I'm chairing Orals.

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:55.128
This is not going to take long.

01:13:58.028 --> 01:13:59.227
Coffee, please.

01:13:59.228 --> 01:14:00.828
I'm having Cognac.

01:14:00.928 --> 01:14:02.528
Hennessy for my wife.

01:14:07.428 --> 01:14:08.928
What is this?

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:12.628
I wanted to give each other a
chance to lay things out straight.

01:14:13.528 --> 01:14:15.828
I want to tell each
other everything.

01:14:15.928 --> 01:14:17.428
The truth.

01:14:20.428 --> 01:14:23.027
Is there something that
you want to tell me?

01:14:23.028 --> 01:14:23.928
Me?

01:14:24.028 --> 01:14:25.828
Just tell me.

01:14:29.628 --> 01:14:31.128
About New York?

01:14:31.228 --> 01:14:32.728
Okay.

01:14:38.028 --> 01:14:39.428
I lied.

01:14:42.428 --> 01:14:43.708
I didn't want to
have a birthday.

01:14:43.728 --> 01:14:47.728
I didn't want to have another year
closer to retirement. So I stayed.

01:14:47.729 --> 01:14:50.328
I had a drink. I had three.

01:14:51.628 --> 01:14:53.127
You went and had a
drink with Miranda.

01:14:53.128 --> 01:14:54.827
- Oh...
- You did.

01:14:54.828 --> 01:14:56.628
- You listened to my messages.
- What did you do with her?

01:14:56.728 --> 01:14:57.528
Now you're spying on me.

01:14:57.529 --> 01:14:59.427
You know, I planned
your party for months.

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:01.928
I secretly call each and
every one of our friends.

01:15:02.028 --> 01:15:06.627
I...I... I spend thousands of dollars
on a cake, a caterer and flowers.

01:15:06.628 --> 01:15:08.528
I act like some
superhuman housewife and.

01:15:08.628 --> 01:15:11.028
...you're screwing an eighteen-year-old
because I am a fucking idiot.

01:15:11.128 --> 01:15:13.128
I didn't screw her.
I flirted with her.

01:15:13.228 --> 01:15:15.128
You are so full of shit.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.028
What?

01:15:31.128 --> 01:15:32.528
What?

01:15:36.528 --> 01:15:38.428
What? Who was that girl?

01:15:42.328 --> 01:15:43.628
Hm?

01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:50.128
Nobody.

01:15:52.428 --> 01:15:54.028
She was nobody.

01:16:04.328 --> 01:16:05.728
It's over.

01:16:08.128 --> 01:16:09.628
That's it?

01:16:09.828 --> 01:16:10.828
Yes.

01:16:12.228 --> 01:16:14.228
Well, wait a minute. You...

01:16:14.628 --> 01:16:18.128
...you came here to lay
the cards on the table.

01:16:18.528 --> 01:16:20.628
I'm the only one who's
admitted anything.

01:16:20.728 --> 01:16:23.328
I can't explain it. It was...
it was so sudden.

01:16:23.428 --> 01:16:25.527
It was so unexpected
and it's over now.

01:16:25.528 --> 01:16:27.578
And I'm supposed to
be happy about that?

01:16:27.579 --> 01:16:30.528
I'm supposed to be happy you had
your little mid-life crisis fling?

01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:32.428
It wasn't a fling.

01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:40.328
Jesus, Catherine.

01:16:40.728 --> 01:16:42.928
How many times have
I been tempted?

01:16:43.028 --> 01:16:45.127
And I never did anything about it.
Never once.

01:16:45.128 --> 01:16:46.627
No. But you wanted to.

01:16:46.628 --> 01:16:49.728
I'm human! Could you say
you'd been any different?

01:16:49.928 --> 01:16:53.028
I have never, ever wanted
to be with anybody else.

01:16:53.029 --> 01:16:54.728
You're lying to me.

01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.828
You're fucking lying.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:06.328
You took me from work.

01:17:07.228 --> 01:17:10.328
And you brought me all the way down
here to be honest with each other.

01:17:10.428 --> 01:17:12.028
You've told me nothing.

01:17:24.528 --> 01:17:25.728
Wait!

01:17:26.528 --> 01:17:27.728
David!

01:17:28.628 --> 01:17:29.928
Wait...

01:17:31.028 --> 01:17:32.228
Sorry, pal.

01:17:33.328 --> 01:17:36.128
I'll tell you. She said
that her name was Chloe.

01:17:36.228 --> 01:17:37.228
What?

01:17:37.728 --> 01:17:41.127
A girl. I asked her to do something.
To tempt you.

01:17:41.128 --> 01:17:44.289
I wanted to see what you were doing because
I thought you were having an affair.

01:17:44.328 --> 01:17:46.828
- I'm not cheating, Catherine...
- I know. I know that now.

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:49.927
I know, but at the time she
said she slept with you.

01:17:49.928 --> 01:17:52.128
- This is ridiculous.
- She took my money.

01:17:52.228 --> 01:17:54.428
...and she lied
about sex with you.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:58.928
And I'd meet up with her and she'd
tell me... She'd tell every detail.

01:18:00.028 --> 01:18:01.527
Like what?

01:18:01.528 --> 01:18:03.028
Stories.

01:18:04.328 --> 01:18:07.128
She said that it started
with a picnic in the park.

01:18:08.928 --> 01:18:11.628
At Allen Gardens in
the conservatory.

01:18:12.328 --> 01:18:16.128
She said she kissed you and she
could feel you getting excited.

01:18:16.828 --> 01:18:20.927
It was... It was confusing.

01:18:20.928 --> 01:18:26.328
It just... But it made
me feel closer to you.

01:18:27.528 --> 01:18:30.428
You become more
beautiful every year.

01:18:30.928 --> 01:18:34.728
Every... Every grey
hair, every line.

01:18:35.028 --> 01:18:37.427
Everything that happens to you.

01:18:37.428 --> 01:18:40.027
...makes you so much more
desirable and I feel like.

01:18:40.028 --> 01:18:42.728
...if you were to blow
on me I'd vanish.

01:18:43.028 --> 01:18:44.528
I'd disappear.

01:18:45.628 --> 01:18:49.128
I felt so invisible and so old.

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:55.528
I slept with her.

01:19:06.528 --> 01:19:09.328
You and I used to make
love three times a day.

01:19:09.528 --> 01:19:11.127
And then every day.

01:19:11.128 --> 01:19:12.828
And then once a week.

01:19:12.928 --> 01:19:18.027
And then was born and then we became
parents and we were best friends.

01:19:18.028 --> 01:19:21.828
And I didn't know how to go from being
your best friend to being your lover.

01:19:22.628 --> 01:19:24.228
You stopped touching me.

01:19:24.328 --> 01:19:26.828
David, I couldn't
look at myself.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.228
I didn't know who I was.

01:19:29.728 --> 01:19:33.527
I think I'm nineteen and then
I look in the mirror and.

01:19:33.528 --> 01:19:37.428
I'm this person that doesn't
know how to seduce you.

01:21:28.328 --> 01:21:30.228
So show me around the house.

01:21:44.128 --> 01:21:47.327
I don't want to leave you but I'm late
and they're going to kill me at school.

01:21:47.328 --> 01:21:49.928
I'll still be here.
I'll wait for you at home.

01:21:51.028 --> 01:21:54.628
I'm sorry. For not trusting you.

01:21:59.128 --> 01:22:00.428
Hurry home.

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:15.328
Where's your parents' room?

01:22:15.928 --> 01:22:18.128
It's... it's upstairs.

01:22:49.128 --> 01:22:50.728
What are you doing?

01:23:50.928 --> 01:23:52.228
Look at me.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:53.727
Look at me.

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:54.828
Look at me.

01:24:15.228 --> 01:24:16.828
...to tell the story.

01:24:16.928 --> 01:24:19.928
Historical transposition is
tremendously complex and...

01:24:55.128 --> 01:24:56.528
Michael?

01:24:57.428 --> 01:24:59.828
Shit! Shit!

01:25:00.828 --> 01:25:02.128
Come on.

01:25:02.428 --> 01:25:04.428
Michael, get out of here.

01:25:06.128 --> 01:25:07.228
Come on. Let's go!

01:25:07.328 --> 01:25:08.428
Michael...

01:25:08.628 --> 01:25:11.228
You... You think
that you can buy me.

01:25:11.328 --> 01:25:14.027
...and I'm just going to
go away, just like that?

01:25:14.028 --> 01:25:16.827
Did you think that you could just
put money in my hand and I would...

01:25:16.828 --> 01:25:18.628
...and I would go and
take care of myself?

01:25:18.728 --> 01:25:20.628
Michael. Michael, I don't
want you to hear this.

01:25:20.728 --> 01:25:22.428
Come on. Get out. Get out.
Get out now.

01:25:22.628 --> 01:25:23.828
Please go!

01:25:26.528 --> 01:25:29.428
- I don't want you near my son.
- Mom!

01:25:29.528 --> 01:25:31.827
He's not yours.
Your husband isn't yours.

01:25:31.828 --> 01:25:35.227
I'm not yours. We're not
just here to do as you say.

01:25:35.228 --> 01:25:38.527
When... when you pay us and
when you want us and...

01:25:38.528 --> 01:25:41.728
...and when to dispose of us.

01:25:41.828 --> 01:25:44.127
I understand I did this.
I brought you into my marriage.

01:25:44.128 --> 01:25:46.327
But you need to
stay away from him.

01:25:46.328 --> 01:25:49.128
I felt you in him.

01:25:49.528 --> 01:25:51.228
- In his eyes.
- Mom!

01:25:51.328 --> 01:25:55.028
In the tiny little
things that he does.

01:25:55.328 --> 01:25:57.628
I actually think that
he could be, like...

01:25:57.728 --> 01:26:00.027
...he could be a good boy
for me to start dating.

01:26:00.028 --> 01:26:01.928
My husband's going to
be home any minute.

01:26:02.028 --> 01:26:04.127
David... it's fine
then with David, huh?

01:26:04.128 --> 01:26:06.228
Is it working out for you?
I did my job.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:08.927
Let me get you dressed
and I'll drive you home.

01:26:08.928 --> 01:26:11.128
...and we can talk
there, all right?

01:26:22.828 --> 01:26:24.528
You liked it.

01:26:25.828 --> 01:26:28.628
I'm sorry I misled you.

01:26:33.428 --> 01:26:34.728
No, you're not.

01:26:35.028 --> 01:26:36.028
Excuse me?

01:26:36.029 --> 01:26:37.728
No, you're not sorry.

01:26:41.928 --> 01:26:43.328
You shared your secrets with me.

01:26:43.428 --> 01:26:44.128
Okay...

01:26:44.129 --> 01:26:46.027
We made our own little
world together.

01:26:46.028 --> 01:26:48.027
And you didn't say no
to anything about me.

01:26:48.028 --> 01:26:49.327
You made me fall
in love with you!

01:26:49.328 --> 01:26:50.608
I didn't mean for
that to happen.

01:26:50.628 --> 01:26:52.588
I felt something but it was
always for my husband.

01:26:52.628 --> 01:26:55.027
You wouldn't have your husband
back if it weren't for me.

01:26:55.028 --> 01:26:56.349
Come on.
Let's go home.

01:26:57.428 --> 01:27:01.228
How can you be doing this to me?
Or am I worth nothing to you?

01:27:02.228 --> 01:27:03.428
God.

01:27:03.828 --> 01:27:07.028
You're bleeding. Please.
Please let me take you home.

01:27:08.828 --> 01:27:10.228
Please stop.

01:27:11.528 --> 01:27:12.828
Uh...

01:27:16.528 --> 01:27:18.328
You're beautiful.

01:27:18.428 --> 01:27:20.128
You must know that.

01:27:20.328 --> 01:27:22.228
You really are.

01:27:25.328 --> 01:27:27.928
Tell me... tell
me what you want.

01:27:32.628 --> 01:27:34.828
I want you to kiss me.

01:27:45.228 --> 01:27:46.228
No!

01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:47.628
Oh, my God!

01:29:30.728 --> 01:29:31.928
Catherine!

01:29:32.252 --> 01:29:33.998
Congratulations!
