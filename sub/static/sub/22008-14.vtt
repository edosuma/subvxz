00:10.928 --> 00:11.918
You're late.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.754
I came as soon as I could.
Train was delayed.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.636
I was very clear about being punctual.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.183
What?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.219
You're joking. I'm five minutes late.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.639
If this were to work,
it will depend entirely on...

00:24.816 --> 00:28.776
On the routines
and the patterns that I set forth.

00:28.987 --> 00:33.482
As you're failing already, I doubt
your ability to stay the course over time.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.074
It won't happen again.

00:39.373 --> 00:43.834
Tell me again, about that day,
how you found her. How it felt.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.535
What?

00:45.921 --> 00:49.005
Walk me through
what happened with Nicki.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.583
You came home early because...?

00:51.843 --> 00:54.631
We'd been having problems,
I wanted to surprise her.

00:54.846 --> 00:58.385
I remember her shoes,
a set of keys on the table...

00:58.559 --> 01:03.600
Don't tell me what you saw,
tell me what you felt. What you feel.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.973
I felt...

01:11.071 --> 01:12.607
...rage.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.443
Nothing else.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.614
I wasn't hurt, or sad, or betrayed.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.744
All I felt was rage.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.952
Like the only thing
that mattered is that she...

01:24.585 --> 01:25.792
<i>I wanted....</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:28.787
I wanted to hurt her.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.879
Not him.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.585
Her.

01:32.926 --> 01:37.921
That feeling you have right now,
that anger...

01:38.515 --> 01:40.552
...I want you to hold on to that.

01:41.101 --> 01:45.061
Because that malice you feel
in your heart is more dependable...

01:45.230 --> 01:50.601
...than any contract killer,
or hit man or third person.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.518
Can you do that, Brian?

01:52.988 --> 01:57.949
Is your hatred big enough
to sustain you?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.115
Yes.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.990
You remember that.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.746
I will contact you again...

02:07.919 --> 02:10.411
...when you have gathered
the items on this list.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.497
"Two pairs of yellow running shoes...

02:12.674 --> 02:15.963
...iPhone..."
An apartment on Washington Place?

02:16.178 --> 02:18.511
It's a lovely unit around the corner.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.013
You want me to rent
an apartment in Manhattan?

02:21.183 --> 02:24.642
You want a perfect alibi
for murdering your wife?

02:25.228 --> 02:26.639
I'll do it today.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.391
When you're...

02:28.565 --> 02:30.898
...watching your wife die...

02:31.610 --> 02:34.694
...it will be well worth the wait.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.670
That detective, Singleton?
He was in my apartment while I was out.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.831
- What?
- No warrant, just broke in.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.583
Where'd you get these?

02:56.760 --> 03:00.879
I installed cameras in my house.
I had my suspicions, now I have proof.

03:01.056 --> 03:04.094
The lead detective investigating
Tom's murder is a dirty cop.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.014
Where are you on reinstatement?

03:07.187 --> 03:10.100
I have my fitness-for-duty
evaluation tomorrow.

03:10.273 --> 03:15.109
Fifty minutes of pure reflection
and self-evaluation.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.942
- You've been to therapy?
- God, yes. Therapy helped me become...

03:19.116 --> 03:21.028
...an entirely different person.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.738
Agent Navabi is ready to meet.

03:23.912 --> 03:28.703
Several years ago, one of my bankers
in Liechtenstein shared with me some...

03:28.875 --> 03:31.208
...unpublished works by Carl Jung...

03:31.378 --> 03:34.337
...handwritten notes on napkins,
journals and such.

03:34.506 --> 03:37.294
It was easily the most...

03:37.467 --> 03:43.054
...enlightening, consequential five days
I've ever spent in a chalet.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.677
What about that week in Davos?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.593
Yes, well...

03:48.770 --> 03:50.853
...that was a cottage.

03:52.691 --> 03:56.275
Agent Navabi, are you familiar
with the Innocence Project?

03:56.486 --> 04:00.275
Of course. They use DNA evidence
to exonerate the wrongfully convicted.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.283
The majority of the convictions
they overturn...

04:03.452 --> 04:05.364
...are based on eyewitness testimony.

04:05.537 --> 04:09.326
People who swore
they had seen something they hadn't.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.037
What does this have to do
with Sam DeMarco?

04:12.210 --> 04:15.044
DeMarco was brought in
for questioning in connection with...

04:15.213 --> 04:18.047
...the untimely demise
of his business partner.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.584
As it occurred in the wake of
a bitter falling-out between the two...

04:21.762 --> 04:25.346
...the police identified Mr. DeMarco
as a prime suspect.

04:25.515 --> 04:29.759
Until four eyewitnesses placed him
miles from the scene of the crime.

04:29.978 --> 04:34.018
People think memory works
like a video recorder.

04:34.191 --> 04:39.403
The mind records events, and then,
on cue, plays back an exact replica.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.780
In truth, memories are reconstructed.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.113
More like putting together
an ever-changing jigsaw puzzle...

04:46.286 --> 04:48.403
...than replaying a video.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.196
So the witnesses are wrong?

04:50.373 --> 04:54.367
Manipulated, into providing a killer
with an airtight alibi...

04:54.544 --> 04:57.662
...by a master in the art of misdirection.

04:57.881 --> 05:02.797
- The next name on the Blacklist.
- A man appropriately known as The Alibi.

05:03.386 --> 05:07.630
Albert Gelfeld. The prime suspect
in the death of his estranged father.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.141
Caroline McClean, person of interest...

05:10.310 --> 05:13.428
...in the disappearance of the heir
to a real-estate empire.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.391
Bjorn Erikson, last person to be seen
with a Lebanese diplomat before...

05:17.609 --> 05:21.979
...his body turned up in the East River.
Three suspects in three unsolved crimes.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.484
Like Sam DeMarco,
each had motive, opportunity.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.365
According to Red, they're guilty.

05:26.576 --> 05:30.411
How does he say this Alibi does it?
Witness tampering? Bribery?

05:30.580 --> 05:33.539
Maybe he gets someone else
to commit the crime for his clients.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.872
<i>Times it, so when it happens,
they're elsewhere, like in public.</i>

05:37.045 --> 05:38.707
<i>So other people see them.</i>

05:38.922 --> 05:41.710
The details in your inquiry
were pretty vague.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.172
It is a strange type of request, but...

05:45.345 --> 05:47.132
...easy money, as they say.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.467
What do you do? Are you an artist?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.349
In a manner of speaking...

05:52.519 --> 05:53.976
...yes.

05:55.105 --> 05:58.439
The Alibi works with people who want
to commit the crimes themselves.

05:58.608 --> 06:02.773
- He doesn't offer hit men, only alibis.
- That let people be in two places at once.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.275
The alibi can exonerate anyone
from any crime...

06:05.448 --> 06:08.907
...by getting people he's never met
to swear to things they never saw.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.784
Ressler, Navabi, find the witness...

06:10.954 --> 06:13.071
...that says she saw DeMarco
at the murder.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.365
Press her for details, flaws in her story.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.456
I wanna know if she made a mistake
or is an accessory to murder.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.838
Like I said, I told the cops what I know.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.962
You saw DeMarco the day
of the incident. You speak to him?

06:26.177 --> 06:27.543
No, I was on the phone.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.054
- How do you know it was him?
- I saw him.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.431
Did you?
Or were you paid to say that?

06:32.601 --> 06:34.809
You think I'd work here
if someone paid me off?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.761
Look, I know what I saw.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.022
Guy comes in every morning for coffee
and a paper like clockwork.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.558
- You can set your watch by him.
- Every morning?

06:42.777 --> 06:45.269
Yeah, for coffee, paper, lottery tickets.

06:45.614 --> 06:48.277
He bought lottery tickets
on the morning in question?

06:48.491 --> 06:51.325
Twenty bucks' worth.
Right after pulling cash out of the ATM.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.032
We're gonna need access
to that camera.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.162
Looks like him.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.366
The hat and the sunglasses
look suspicious.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.876
That's what I thought, until....

07:01.463 --> 07:03.876
And here we go. There.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.299
- It's him.
- Yes. Except it's not.

07:07.469 --> 07:11.338
Facial-recognition software says
it is only an 81 percent match...

07:11.514 --> 07:17.055
...with discrepancies in vein pattern,
eye distance, and pitch of the lower lip.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.512
- Maybe the system's wrong.
- It could be wrong.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.064
But if it's right,
and I suspect that it is...

07:22.233 --> 07:25.021
...then you're looking at
a convincing double...

07:25.195 --> 07:27.983
...who helped Sam DeMarco
get away with murder.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.441
Release the photo to the bureau
and local P.D., see if we get a match.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.407
If he's been arrested, charged,
whoever this double is, he's got a name.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.788
And I wanna know what it is.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.834
You did well.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.920
About this routine,
who are you trying to make me look like?

07:49.094 --> 07:50.960
Mr. Thompson, we agreed.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.925
Sorry, no questions.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.600
It's just...

07:59.354 --> 08:01.971
...you're paying me a lot of money to...

08:02.190 --> 08:05.058
...go on a jog
and get a cup of coffee.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.448
Is this who I'm supposed to be?

08:13.660 --> 08:17.745
- This Barrett, Brian Barrett?
- I wish you hadn't done that.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.873
I'm doubling this guy?
Are people supposed to think I'm him?

08:21.418 --> 08:23.375
- If this is illegal...
- I'm sorry.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.170
Unfortunately, this won't work with you.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.179
Okay. Don't fight it. Oh, don't fight it.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.265
Hey. This is...

08:38.434 --> 08:41.222
...how it would have ended anyway.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.471
Let it go.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.184
Just...

08:45.358 --> 08:47.350
...let it go.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.113
Thank you for coming.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.865
I assume it's a pressing matter.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.450
It's about Keen. I know you're helping
look for the man who killed her husband.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.451
- Yes.
- I imagine the methods...

09:05.670 --> 09:08.754
...you and she have used have been,
shall we say, fast and loose?

09:08.923 --> 09:11.085
I asked you here
to tell you that has to end.

09:11.301 --> 09:14.510
BOLO went out an hour ago.
Still nothing on Shula.

09:16.014 --> 09:19.348
This is the man eyewitnesses ID'd
as Sam DeMarco.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.970
And this...

09:22.562 --> 09:24.269
...is DeMarco.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.597
He's using doubles.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.141
A homeless man matching
DeMarco's description...

09:28.318 --> 09:30.856
...was picked up
for public intoxication last month.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.737
Kahil Shula. Where he is now
is anyone's guess.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.694
Some guess.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.654
Others know.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.284
May I?

09:40.371 --> 09:45.332
We'll do everything we can to help find
Tom's killer. But once she's reinstated...

09:45.502 --> 09:49.246
...Elizabeth will have to
enforce the rules, not break them.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.013
Let's talk about your daughter.

10:04.187 --> 10:08.022
She's with her grandmother
until this ends.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.314
Until what ends?

10:09.484 --> 10:12.397
Until I find closure.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.856
And...

10:14.030 --> 10:16.864
...how do you envision that happening?

10:17.534 --> 10:19.992
Through revenge.
That's why I need you.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.069
To help me find another way.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.830
Does the desire for revenge
come naturally to you?

10:25.333 --> 10:29.327
I think it comes naturally to anyone
who's seen her husband murdered.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.580
Let's talk about Raymond Reddington.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.421
- What about him?
- I know something of your relationship.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.463
I can't make a worthwhile evaluation
until I know everything.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.507
What did Psych Services
tell you about me?

10:43.685 --> 10:47.554
Only that in order
to get my badge back, I need your okay.

10:47.730 --> 10:52.475
Before I give you that,
you feel you need closure.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.268
Don't you?

10:54.487 --> 11:00.199
If by closure, you mean become numb
to the pain caused by Tom's death or...

11:00.368 --> 11:03.782
...anesthetize it, then no,
I don't think you need that.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.199
Anger is not an unhealthy emotion.
It generates passion.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.583
Risk.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.870
The desire to paint outside the lines.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.464
I'm drawn to that.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.754
My guess is that you are too.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.757
What makes you say that?

11:21.848 --> 11:24.215
Let's talk about your father.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.942
If it isn't R squared
and my man Dembe.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.564
Hello, Marion.

11:36.738 --> 11:40.402
It's been too long, Marty.
You look wonderful.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.988
Well, we're up to 700 meals a day.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.279
We got housing for another 60.
Wouldn't be half that without you.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.954
I give and I get.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.117
The eyes and ears
of an invisible army.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.126
Speaking of which...

11:53.296 --> 11:55.754
...Kahil Shula. Homeless.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.837
In considerable trouble.
I need to find him.

11:59.010 --> 12:02.219
So please,
circulate the photo and the word.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.504
Done and done-r.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.220
Now, how about you two come
try Randy's raisin bread pudding?

12:07.393 --> 12:10.227
- Sounds absolutely delightful.
- Come on, let's go.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.985
<i>Ritual is everything.</i>

12:19.155 --> 12:22.899
<i>Respect it and in time,
it will become second nature.</i>

12:23.076 --> 12:25.659
<i>Until then, find the signposts.</i>

12:26.537 --> 12:30.702
<i>Each morning, your run will begin
between 8 and 8:10.</i>

12:31.334 --> 12:35.578
<i>Along your route, there is a young man
who opens 192 Books...</i>

12:36.714 --> 12:39.707
<i>...a falafel vendor on 10th Avenue...</i>

12:40.843 --> 12:44.928
<i>...a doorman at The Fleming,
who is there rain or shine.</i>

12:45.098 --> 12:47.385
<i>Make sure
to acknowledge these people.</i>

12:47.600 --> 12:49.512
<i>Let them see you.</i>

12:49.727 --> 12:55.314
<i>As your pattern emerges,
you'll find others with ritualistic behavior.</i>

12:56.276 --> 12:58.108
<i>Neighbors with patterns.</i>

13:00.029 --> 13:01.816
Double espresso, shot of milk.

13:08.162 --> 13:11.781
The falafel vendor waved at you.
You didn't acknowledge him.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.167
He needs to know your face,
he sees hundreds every day.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.123
I've been at this for months.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.005
I could care less
about the falafel guy and what he needs.

13:20.174 --> 13:23.963
- He could be critical to our story...
- You know who likes falafel? Phil.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.254
Who was screwing my wife
when we started this.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.139
When you promised me a double.
Now he's moved in with her.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.349
He's living in my house with my kids.
I'm here waving to falafel guy.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.431
This routine is not for you. It's for them.

13:37.150 --> 13:42.487
We have to get them to remember you
when it's not you.

13:49.704 --> 13:50.990
Marty. Any good news?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.030
We haven't found who
you're looking for.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.915
But we found a woman
who knows him, her name is Delores.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.327
I'll put you on the line with her.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.080
- Hello?
- Delores, hello.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.624
Thank you for helping.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.292
You're looking for Kahil?

14:05.470 --> 14:08.929
That's right, Kahil Shula.
What can you tell me about him?

14:09.098 --> 14:10.930
<i>Good person. Last time I seen him...</i>

14:11.142 --> 14:15.978
...he was talking to a man
in front of the West 26th Street shelter.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.978
<i>Said something about a job,
got into his fancy car and drove off.</i>

14:20.151 --> 14:23.189
- A fancy car?
- Gold, with four doors.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.652
Oh, and it had an E-ZPass
in the window.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.567
It's Elizabeth, she wants to meet.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.322
Delores, do you like veal?

14:31.537 --> 14:35.247
My chef is preparing osso bucco
for dinner tomorrow night.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.329
Would you care to join me?
I could have a car pick you up...

14:38.503 --> 14:40.244
...say 6:30, quarter of 7?

14:41.923 --> 14:43.664
Yeah.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.420
What? Wait, I'm confused, I don't...

14:46.594 --> 14:48.677
I have nothing to do
with your reinstatement.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.929
My therapist disagrees,
and it's up to her.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.840
Besides, I thought you liked therapy.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.385
It can be transformative
for people who need it. We don't.

14:56.938 --> 15:00.147
If Singleton works with Tom's killer,
if they're both on the force...

15:00.316 --> 15:03.184
...we'll need the bureau's help.
To get that, I need my badge.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.775
And to get that,
you need to go to therapy.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.157
Reddington.
Singleton was in my apartment...

15:10.535 --> 15:11.946
That won't happen again.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.032
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.867
Text Dembe the time and place.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.015
Keen's working for Reddington.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.347
Could be her husband was too.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.859
The guy's got judges,
cops and prosecutors in his pocket.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.235
Why not an FBI agent too?

15:47.405 --> 15:50.614
Her husband gets in over his head
with the Nash syndicate.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.571
They come for him, don't know
Reddington's protecting him.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.283
He leaves five dead in the apartment,
Keen knows it, but won't give him up.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.744
Think he moved in,
took control of the syndicate?

15:59.917 --> 16:03.331
He takes over, uses his FBI stooge
to keep us a step behind.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.042
We get a lead on a shipment
in Maryland, it don't show.

16:06.215 --> 16:10.050
We get a witness
who agrees to testify, he turns up dead.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.712
Think Keen's working for drug dealers?
A drug dealer killed her husband.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.677
Is she in Reddington's pocket?

16:16.267 --> 16:17.553
Sure looks like it.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.260
Then how much of a Girl Scout
can she be?

16:21.856 --> 16:25.975
I say we keep following her.
And we tell no one outside this room.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.690
Red's the biggest fish
in domestic law enforcement.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.071
And if Detective Singleton's right...

16:31.240 --> 16:33.232
...we got him on the hook.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.740
Dr. Fulton, I understand
you'd like to talk.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.084
I am so sorry. I tried getting him
to come to your office.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.043
This is as close as he would come.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.459
Nothing personal.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.754
May I pay you the courtesy
of being blunt?

16:54.931 --> 16:56.672
Please.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.179
You disgust me.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.595
I was told you wanted
to talk about Elizabeth.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.059
You're a glorified serial killer.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.859
Everything I hear about Agent Keen
is that she's talented, smart...

17:10.070 --> 17:11.858
...tough, resilient.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.397
Recommending reinstatement
would be a no-brainer...

17:14.575 --> 17:16.612
...if not for her relationship with you.

17:17.244 --> 17:22.115
Remind me, was "the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree" a psychological theory...

17:22.290 --> 17:25.954
...first pioneered by Piaget,
or Lucy in <i>Peanuts?</i>

17:26.170 --> 17:28.787
She murdered the attorney general
of the United States.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.082
I killed a key member
of a global conspiracy.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.876
And went on the run with you
like Bonnie and Clyde.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.046
I helped prevent a false-flag operation
that could've put this...

17:37.223 --> 17:41.263
Some kids run from their fathers' sins.
She embraces them.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.262
Are we finished?

17:45.439 --> 17:47.931
Fidelity, bravery, integrity.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.975
This is the bureau's motto.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.736
Do you honestly believe
a child of yours can honor that?

17:54.407 --> 17:57.525
Would you honestly believe
any answer I gave?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.110
I doubt it.

18:00.288 --> 18:03.827
Agent Keen's future with the bureau
depends on you giving it your best shot.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.664
No. Elizabeth's future
with the bureau depends on her...

18:07.837 --> 18:09.544
...giving it her best shot.

18:09.714 --> 18:13.674
And your willingness to judge her
on her merits, not mine.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.092
Push her. Provoke her.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.800
Figure out a way
past her grief and anger...

18:18.973 --> 18:21.556
...and you'll see her
for who she really is.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.135
- And who is that?
- Everything that I am not.

18:25.688 --> 18:31.559
Time's up. I'm afraid that's all for today.
Good session, though. Tough stuff.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.259
Mr. Eckhart. David, Dave?

19:01.474 --> 19:02.885
Yeah?

19:03.059 --> 19:04.175
Who's asking?

19:04.727 --> 19:07.595
My name is Ben Rowe.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.810
I'd like to talk with you about a job.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.938
All right, say I do agree to do this, to...

19:14.111 --> 19:16.148
...go on this assignment.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.109
Well, nobody would know.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.940
Because it's illegal?

19:20.117 --> 19:22.655
Not at all. Not your part, your part is....

19:22.828 --> 19:24.285
Is quite simple.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.573
But should we agree to proceed...

19:27.792 --> 19:33.083
...I will provide you with a sequence
of detailed actions for you to complete.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.630
<i>These tasks are quite simple.</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:39.175
<i>A street to take,
a food vendor to pass.</i>

19:39.345 --> 19:41.712
<i>A face to wave at
on your morning jog.</i>

19:41.889 --> 19:45.883
What about these changes
you say you wanna make?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.388
Should you...

19:47.561 --> 19:52.477
...be willing and able to follow the script,
then we would need a few modifications.

19:52.983 --> 19:56.317
<i>So this is, what,
to make me look like someone else?</i>

19:56.529 --> 19:58.521
- Some stranger?
- I can't tell you that.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.315
You give me a makeover,
you tell me to go for a jog...

20:01.492 --> 20:04.326
...and wave at people. Why?
Who am I pretending to be?

20:04.495 --> 20:07.579
It's not important.
Now, stick to the script.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.410
I'm not an idiot.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.918
Whatever this is, isn't good.
How do you know I won't say no?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.830
It's amazing...

20:17.007 --> 20:22.378
...the depth of personal information
one can access with a few keystrokes.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.845
I know about your
upside-down mortgage. Your alimony.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.725
The mounds of debt
that you can never overcome.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.559
Do you think I would have offered
such a significant amount of money...

20:33.733 --> 20:36.350
...unless I thought
you were going to say yes?

20:38.112 --> 20:40.479
You are going to say yes, aren't you?

20:43.367 --> 20:47.327
We've created a list of E-ZPass users
based on a description of The Alibi's car.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.331
We cross-checked that with toll roads
closest to the 26th Street shelter.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.000
- How many cars?
- Eight hundred and forty.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.628
We contacted the toll-road authority
and got video...

20:56.797 --> 20:58.754
...from every license plate of every car.

20:58.924 --> 21:03.760
Out of the 840, 582 are licensed to men.
Any of whom could be our Blacklister.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.592
Pull license photos from the DMV.
Get them to Reddington.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.474
See if his witness
can make a positive ID.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.272
Thank you, Paris.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.978
All he does is cook for you?

21:21.781 --> 21:23.943
- Yes.
- Every day?

21:24.116 --> 21:27.359
Every day.
He's also a hell of a chess player.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.950
Even better than Dembe,
and way better than me.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.957
Well, it's delicious.

21:36.462 --> 21:42.424
Delores, the man Kahil left with,
did you find his picture in the book?

21:43.886 --> 21:44.876
You know...

21:45.054 --> 21:48.047
...when I lost my apartment,
it was the dead of winter...

21:48.224 --> 21:51.137
...and I would have froze to death...

21:51.310 --> 21:53.723
...if it wasn't for Kahil.

21:55.272 --> 21:59.642
The man Kahil left with,
the one in the fancy car.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.561
I worry that he may hurt your friend.

22:02.947 --> 22:06.907
Please help me to protect Kahil.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.951
You have a honest face.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.699
I'm an honest man.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.760
You should call Harold.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.729
Tell him we have an address
for the Blacklister.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.566
No wonder DeMarco walked,
this guy laid out every step of his alibi.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.570
Down to the lottery ticket
he bought the day of the murder.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.822
Proof DeMarco killed
his business partner...

23:28.991 --> 23:31.529
...which makes his double
an accessory if he's alive.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.610
Sinclair is murdering
the doppelgangers?

23:33.787 --> 23:36.495
It's a theory. None have turned up
or gone to the police.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.624
We have, what, a dozen
of these facial casts in the other room.

23:39.793 --> 23:43.787
Another two dozen here. It's like
he's keeping trophies of his conquests.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.419
We have twice as many murders
to charge him with.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.842
Ressler, we have something.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.887
Sinclair's not finished.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.223
Aram, I think we found
Sinclair's next client.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.762
<i>There's another?</i>

24:00.981 --> 24:03.519
- Reddington.
- Agent Navabi, what a pleasure.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.151
We found a plaster mold of a man,
presumably Sinclair's next client.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.857
But not his dossier.

24:09.073 --> 24:12.111
- That presents a problem?
- Sinclair is painstakingly precise.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.776
He keeps detailed records
of every alibi he creates.

24:14.954 --> 24:19.198
And yet the one dossier
we can't find is for his next job.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.875
- Maybe you should keep looking.
<i>- Maybe you took it.</i>

24:23.087 --> 24:26.922
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.
And when it does, let me know.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.834
Then we can celebrate, your treat.

24:33.764 --> 24:37.007
- You could give them the name.
- They'll put it together.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.016
They have the face.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.769
And we have a long drive.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.724
Double espresso, shot of milk.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.608
<i>Hello?</i>

24:52.157 --> 24:55.867
Good news. I found your double.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.871
Why do you want to be reinstated?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.124
To find the man
who murdered my husband.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.995
Five other men were murdered
in your apartment that night.

25:07.172 --> 25:10.506
You interested in finding out
the man who murdered them?

25:10.718 --> 25:12.050
Not as much, no.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.381
The police think
you're not interested at all.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.889
That you're protecting him.
A man who killed five people.

25:18.058 --> 25:21.927
Is this your way of pushing me,
provoking me, like Reddington told you?

25:22.146 --> 25:24.229
He said it would reveal
who you really are.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.976
I know who I really am.

25:26.150 --> 25:29.314
You're the daughter of
the most wanted criminal in the country.

25:29.903 --> 25:34.944
I'm a widow, a mother, and a good cop.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.783
And that's it.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.240
That's all that matters.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.661
You say you want closure.

25:43.834 --> 25:47.123
About Tom, so I can
get my life back on track.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.333
That has nothing
to do with Reddington.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.541
Closure requires a reckoning.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.335
Not just about Tom,
or what happened to him.

25:55.512 --> 25:59.722
But why it happened. What role,
if any, you or Reddington...

25:59.892 --> 26:01.975
...may have played in it.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.306
- I know it's complicated.
- It isn't, actually.

26:04.480 --> 26:08.565
And I understand
why you don't wanna confront it, I do.

26:09.777 --> 26:10.938
But you have to.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.070
Agent Keen, you're a profiler.

26:14.615 --> 26:18.734
I'm not going to reinstate you
until you can honestly profile yourself.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.408
Did you identify the mold
found in Sinclair's apartment?

26:26.585 --> 26:30.454
Our facial-recognition software
didn't pull a match on the mold...

26:30.672 --> 26:35.838
...but Ressler and Navabi found points of
comparison at Sinclair's workshop.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.300
Looks like they're reference photos
for a client he's trying to match.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.385
<i>- So the double's still a mystery?</i>
- Yes.

26:41.600 --> 26:46.436
But not the client, because,
okay, I think... I think I just found him.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.347
Brian Barrett, 33,
an aerospace engineer...

26:49.525 --> 26:53.018
...working for a defense contractor
in Greenbelt, Maryland.

26:53.237 --> 26:56.275
Married to a Nicole Rose Adler,
two kids.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.656
The wife filed for divorce
five months ago.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.575
Aram, contact the ex,
let her know we have a situation.

27:01.787 --> 27:05.906
<i>Ressler, Navabi, have the police
throw a net over the city. Find Barrett.</i>

27:06.083 --> 27:08.621
- Sir, the double?
- We find Barrett, we find the double.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.128
But right now, all I'm worried about
is keeping his ex-wife alive.

27:20.848 --> 27:23.056
I almost thought
you were gonna be late.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.349
Are we good to...?

27:29.773 --> 27:32.311
My God. How did you...?

27:32.526 --> 27:35.769
Please. We have a schedule to keep.

27:35.946 --> 27:38.780
Now, gentlemen, the routine.

27:38.991 --> 27:42.826
Let us review it one more time.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.919
No answer on Nicki Adler's phone.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.422
- What about the boyfriend?
- Out of town.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.754
Her assistant couldn't reach him.

27:59.511 --> 28:04.552
Okay, I was able to access the GPS
on Nicole Adler's car, she just stopped.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.183
I've got her at a parking garage...

28:07.394 --> 28:09.431
...off West Park Drive
and Tyson's Corner.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.729
- That's her work.
- We're en route.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.110
Brian. My God, you scared me.

28:25.537 --> 28:29.497
- Hey, Nic.
- What are you doing at my office?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.746
- Why are you even here?
- Well, that's the thing.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.707
I'm not here.

28:35.631 --> 28:38.248
Brian. Please.

28:38.425 --> 28:41.884
- What is this?
- Oh, this isn't even happening.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.798
Not with me, at least.
See, actually, I'm in New York.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.887
<i>In fact, right now,
I'm leaving my apartment in Manhattan...</i>

28:49.228 --> 28:52.642
<i>...about to go on my morning jog,
like I've done every morning...</i>

28:52.814 --> 28:56.808
<i>...since I found you and Phil
together in my bed.</i>

28:57.277 --> 29:00.111
<i>So I'm not here.</i>

29:01.198 --> 29:02.439
Brian, please.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.320
Whatever it is
that you think you're doing, I...

29:05.494 --> 29:07.907
I remember that moment so vividly.

29:08.121 --> 29:11.580
Holding that champagne bottle,
wanting to crack it over your head.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.283
- Please...
- But knowing...

29:13.460 --> 29:17.921
...that if I did, I would go to jail.
So I waited, and I planned.

29:18.131 --> 29:23.547
And now I'm actually about to get away
with putting two bullets in that smug face.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.200
Double espresso, shot of milk.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.498
No.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.508
Goodbye, Nic.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.052
- You okay?
- Yeah.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.308
It's okay, it's okay. Okay, hang on.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.131
Thanks for the assist.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.178
Anytime.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.356
How did it go?

31:04.821 --> 31:06.687
Just like we said.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.694
- Deviations?
- No.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.366
The train?

31:11.119 --> 31:13.782
Nobody followed me.
I went for the run, to his apartment.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.322
And I changed.
It went just like we said.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.116
Very good.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.501
About your payment.

31:26.343 --> 31:27.709
He'll take the gun.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.924
Please, and thank you.

31:36.186 --> 31:37.222
What's going on?

31:37.771 --> 31:40.013
- You were about to leave.
- Who the hell are you?

31:40.190 --> 31:41.431
I haven't been paid yet.

31:41.608 --> 31:45.477
Mr. Eckhart, go now
and you'll live to die another day.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.237
Cover up, it's mucky out there.

31:51.952 --> 31:56.071
I've been looking for you.
Let's go for a little drive.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.828
Look, whoever you are...

32:03.004 --> 32:09.046
...I can assure you that confronting it
with violence is no way to resolution.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.336
A pacifist.

32:12.514 --> 32:13.504
How refreshing.

32:13.682 --> 32:17.050
Did Hulton send you?
Is that what this is about?

32:17.227 --> 32:19.640
That absurd assignment in Jakarta?

32:20.063 --> 32:23.852
Mr. Sinclair, I have no idea
who Mr. Hulton is...

32:24.025 --> 32:26.017
...or what he's up to in Jakarta.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.231
My name is Raymond Reddington.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.529
Should I know who you are?

32:30.740 --> 32:32.857
I know who you are.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.197
You're obsessive-compulsive.

32:35.745 --> 32:40.080
You have a mind-numbingly patient
and thoughtful attention to detail.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.993
I've admired your work for some time.

32:43.753 --> 32:46.166
This is a strange way to show it.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.122
I'm a strange fellow.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.008
I've heard whispers
of your work for years now.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.465
Stories of your legerdemain.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.678
Your ability to put a man
in two places at once.

32:58.226 --> 33:03.767
The concept of bilocation is appealing,
even if not without consequence.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.478
I suspect you're a fan
of quantum theory?

33:06.651 --> 33:08.893
I've read a bit of Schrödinger myself.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.858
I'm more a Dostoyevsky man.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.490
Yes, of course, <i>The Double.</i>

33:14.659 --> 33:17.743
I love a good doppelgänger story.

33:18.038 --> 33:19.995
What about Ursula Le Guin?

33:20.165 --> 33:26.253
Oh, <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, yes, yes?
Oh, a delightful tale.

33:26.463 --> 33:30.798
- And <i>Aiding and Abetting.</i>
- By Muriel Spark.

33:30.967 --> 33:34.881
One of my favorite British writers.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.300
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.473
It's not important.

33:40.018 --> 33:45.013
What is important is that you and I
may have more in common than reading.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.566
- Crime.
- Yes.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.236
I thought you...
You brought me here to kill me.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.862
Oh, goodness, no.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.446
I brought you here to protect you.
From the FBI.

33:57.661 --> 34:02.247
I have it on good authority that
they've taken possession of your files.

34:02.415 --> 34:05.533
Without me,
they'll take possession of you.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.414
And you...

34:07.671 --> 34:09.583
...can keep that from happening?

34:09.755 --> 34:13.170
Yes. If you do as I ask.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.467
I'm listening.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.847
Hands where I can see them.

34:28.149 --> 34:31.016
- We need to talk.
- You need to put your hands in the air.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.980
I saw your surveillance cameras.
I know you're scared, you should be.

34:35.197 --> 34:38.065
- Not of me.
- Yes, I'd like to report a burglary.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.402
I saw you meeting Reddington
in Dupont Circle.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.821
You're not the only one
doing surveillance.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.739
You report me, I report you.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.752
Okay, you wanna talk?

34:49.920 --> 34:54.210
Why don't you start by telling me
why you broke into my apartment twice?

34:54.592 --> 34:57.927
Our investigation into the Nash syndicate
isn't getting anywhere.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.338
Witnesses won't talk,
others disappear.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.848
Someone's ahead of us,
someone on the inside.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.634
People I work with think it's you.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.769
You think I'm protecting
the people who killed my husband?

35:07.939 --> 35:11.353
You know Reddington killed the men
we found dead inside your apartment...

35:11.526 --> 35:12.983
...the night your husband died.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.816
I think you killed Navarro
and stole the information...

35:15.989 --> 35:18.402
...that could prove it
out of evidence lockup.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.659
I think you did that, yet,
looking at what you're trying to do...

35:21.828 --> 35:24.115
...my instinct tells me
we're on the same side.

35:24.331 --> 35:27.574
And we need to work together
if we're gonna get who we're looking for.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.250
A dirty cop. But not you?

35:31.004 --> 35:32.836
You can ask around about me.

35:33.006 --> 35:36.249
My reputation, I'll check out real quick.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.384
I wanna trust you,
but you and Reddington...

35:39.596 --> 35:42.930
...I don't see any way
you can explain that away.

35:46.186 --> 35:47.643
There is one way.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.688
But to do it, I'd have to trust you.

35:51.524 --> 35:54.187
And if you betray my trust...

35:54.361 --> 35:57.320
...I assure you,
Raymond Reddington will kill you.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.692
So you do work for him.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.737
I need to make a call.

36:03.453 --> 36:05.820
Sorry, you let him go,
the Blacklister?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.614
I cut a deal, Donald.
You do it all the time.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.954
In pursuit of a more just outcome.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.961
Somehow, I think your goal
is more self-serving.

36:14.631 --> 36:18.545
- What's this?
- The Alibi had 51 clients that we know of.

36:18.718 --> 36:22.302
Because of his handiwork,
none were ever convicted of murder.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.007
With the evidence you obtained
from his place of business...

36:26.184 --> 36:31.350
...you can file charges
against 27 clients who never went to trial.

36:31.523 --> 36:35.688
But thanks to your justice system's
quaint notion of double jeopardy...

36:35.860 --> 36:39.695
...it's too late for the 24
who were already tried and acquitted.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.527
Even though you now
have proof of their guilt.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.239
These are the locations
where Alibi buried the doubles.

36:45.412 --> 36:46.744
Yes, who he murdered.

36:46.955 --> 36:52.167
Murders you can accuse all the clients
of conspiring to commit.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.663
- This is good. This is very good.
- Except for one thing.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.459
The man who murdered the doubles
is The Alibi. You let him go.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.503
Yes, in exchange for that list.

37:03.722 --> 37:04.883
So, what?

37:05.432 --> 37:08.800
- Case closed?
- Not quite. I want something from you.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.008
And what's that?

37:10.186 --> 37:12.894
To give me one of the doubles
when you unearth him.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.398
Kahil Shula.
I want to give him a proper burial.

37:34.294 --> 37:35.751
What are we waiting for?

37:35.920 --> 37:39.379
We bring in Keen, she gives him to us.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.626
Bring in an FBI agent?

37:42.844 --> 37:44.676
My guys will get her to talk.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.382
You do that...

37:46.556 --> 37:50.641
...you'll have the entire bureau
out looking for her. And us.

37:50.810 --> 37:54.520
Why do that when we can have
Singleton do our dirty work for us?

37:54.689 --> 37:56.976
<i>He tracks Keen, we track him.</i>

37:57.192 --> 38:01.562
He finds out how to get
to Reddington, we get to him first.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.110
And the bureau's none the wiser.

38:20.590 --> 38:23.879
Detective Singleton,
this is Special Agent Samar Navabi.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.760
She's been authorized
by Deputy Director Harold Cooper...

38:26.971 --> 38:31.011
- ...to inform you about this task force.
- The Reddington task force?

38:31.226 --> 38:32.762
That's right.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.636
This I gotta hear.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.158
He was never reported missing.

38:50.328 --> 38:55.369
And no inquiry has been made
with M.P.D.C. or the medical examiner.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.451
Some people are truly alone
in this world.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.292
Yup.

39:06.010 --> 39:09.378
Reddington's your CI,
and on your most-wanted list?

39:09.556 --> 39:12.469
And if anyone knew he worked with us,
his intel would dry up.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.508
He'd be of no use to us at all.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.686
No.

39:17.856 --> 39:18.846
But he'd be in jail.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.015
And these criminals
would be on the street.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.900
You said I couldn't explain
my relationship to Reddington.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.858
Look around, detective.
This is my explanation.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.939
Man, it's a pretty good one.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.483
So.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.902
The dirty cop
who killed my husband.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.953
I think I can help you find him.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.838
I just need...

39:45.550 --> 39:47.507
...another minute.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.382
We'll stay as long as you like.

40:07.155 --> 40:10.489
You're blunt.
And I'd like to return the favor.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.033
This is a waste of time.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.159
I wanna be reinstated.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.993
I took a big step
toward finding Tom's killer today...

40:18.166 --> 40:20.874
...and that is not gonna happen
by my sitting here...

40:21.085 --> 40:23.293
...listening to your
misguided preconceptions.

40:23.463 --> 40:26.297
I'd like to straighten you out,
get a clean bill of health...

40:26.466 --> 40:28.002
...and get back to work.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.631
Please, enlighten me.

40:32.764 --> 40:33.800
My profile.

40:34.349 --> 40:37.012
Widow, mom, cop.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.551
That's all there is.

40:39.187 --> 40:42.305
I think there's more.
And you're afraid to examine it.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.816
I know you do, which brings me to fear.

40:45.985 --> 40:48.477
You think I'm afraid to acknowledge...

40:48.655 --> 40:51.398
...the weight of having
Raymond Reddington as a father.

40:51.616 --> 40:55.485
- It's an understandable point of view.
- And one that I shared.

40:55.828 --> 40:59.993
He's evil. He's my father.
I must be evil too.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.244
But you're not.

41:01.417 --> 41:06.037
See, that's our problem,
your preconception. You see him as a....

41:06.464 --> 41:11.380
What did you call him,
a glorified serial killer? He disgusts you?

41:11.552 --> 41:13.009
You see him differently.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.847
When I was little...

41:18.017 --> 41:19.303
...I loved ballet.

41:21.062 --> 41:24.305
Whenever I performed, I felt...

41:24.482 --> 41:26.519
...a presence.

41:27.443 --> 41:30.106
At graduations too, and my wedding.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.447
I don't know, I just always felt....

41:36.119 --> 41:38.281
I always knew...

41:38.663 --> 41:41.326
...someone was watching over me.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.866
Protecting me.

41:44.043 --> 41:45.875
Guiding me.

41:47.046 --> 41:50.915
Some of what he's done
is unimaginably bad.

41:53.428 --> 41:56.671
But some of what he's done
for me is...

41:56.848 --> 41:59.181
...unimaginably good.

42:00.685 --> 42:03.723
So if you want to push me,
provoke me...

42:03.896 --> 42:08.641
...find a way past my anger and grief,
and see who I really am?

42:09.444 --> 42:13.108
A widow, a mom, a cop.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.114
And one more thing.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.779
What's that?

42:21.164 --> 42:22.951
A daughter.
