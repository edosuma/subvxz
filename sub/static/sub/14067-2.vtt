00:02.400 --> 00:04.860
I have a 80% chance
of getting Alzheimer's.

00:04.900 --> 00:07.060
It's not like I'll
remember it. Mad Cow!

00:07.100 --> 00:08.860
I have Weak Stream Syndrome.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.300
Ιrritable bowels.

Denny Crane.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.400
–Grammy!
–Marlena…

00:14.400 --> 00:17.600
I am in big trouble,
Grammy. I need your help.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.960
Melvin Palmer.
How are you?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.360
Attaboy. You're still a
hoot, that's what you are.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.400
Hell, I get paid, win or lose.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.660
No reason this can't be a “win/win.”

00:25.700 --> 00:28.600
I just made more money…
that's what I did.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.660
How is it she ended up
at a Pennsylvania prison?

00:38.700 --> 00:39.960
Well, it's a private facility…

00:40.000 --> 00:43.160
one that we signed off on because
it provided drug counseling.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.160
Was she an addict?

00:44.200 --> 00:45.560
I don't think she's an addict,

00:45.600 --> 00:49.500
but cocaine possession at 15…
it's not an encouraging sign.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.360
Anyway, the facility claimed that

00:51.400 --> 00:55.660
all of their guards had degrees in
juvenile justice, child psychology.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.760
The guard who raped her didn't
even have a high school diploma!

00:58.800 --> 00:59.960
–Okay.
–I don't understand

01:00.000 --> 01:01.360
why they're not anxious to settle.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.560
I mean, what could
their defense possibly be?

01:03.600 --> 01:06.760
Well, prisons, private or otherwise,
aren't held strictly liable.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.260
We'd have to show negligence.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.860
Which basically means
we'd have to prove

01:09.900 --> 01:14.560
they failed to exercise a reasonable
standard of care, using industry standards.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.960
My feeling is that they will settle,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.060
but only after the necessary
amount of posturing.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.160
Sorry I'm late. I took
Storrow instead of surface.

01:21.200 --> 01:25.100
Jerry, my man! How are you,
my friend? Big hug. Ooohhh!

01:25.100 --> 01:28.700
I run on hugs… that's what
I do. Melvin Palmer. Wow!

01:28.700 --> 01:30.860
You are a fetching young
lass, that's what you are.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.060
Am I right, Jerry?
Two pops for yes.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.300
Attaboy. So, what've we got?

01:35.300 --> 01:37.860
You must be the father
of the girl. Tell ya what…

01:37.900 --> 01:41.260
let's fast-forward past the point where
you tell me this is a terrible thing.

01:41.300 --> 01:44.600
No need. See? Unlike the
average GOP fundraiser,

01:44.600 --> 01:47.560
I don't think there's
anything fun about a rape.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.060
Hey, how's my buddy,
Al… that big hoot?

01:50.100 --> 01:54.760
What I'm gonna do is make you two
offers. One's great; the other, better.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.260
Here's the number;
it'll make your eyes pop.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.560
Now, I've got another
number here in my briefcase,

01:59.600 --> 02:01.560
either bigger or smaller than that one.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.060
You tell me what you wanna do.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.360
Ya like whatcha see here?
Just say, “Deal.”

02:05.400 --> 02:08.860
If you don't like it, I open the briefcase,
and you get the other number.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.360
So, what's it gonna be, Big Daddy?

02:10.400 --> 02:13.460
My God! His daughter was raped!
You've turned it into a game show!

02:13.500 --> 02:15.760
Life is nothing but a
sweepstakes… that's what I say.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.160
I tell you. I'm gonna let
you open the briefcase,

02:18.200 --> 02:21.360
cause you're fetching… that's what
you are. You just hold it up like so.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.560
God, it's good to see you!
One pop, for old time's sake.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.160
Hey, I'll take a stomp instead.
So, what's it gonna be, Dad?

02:28.200 --> 02:30.600
Deal or no deal?

Hi, Grammy!

03:08.100 --> 03:10.500
Oh, God. What have you done now?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.760
Nice. That's how you
greet your granddaughter?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.760
Sorry, sweetheart.
How're you doing?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.500
Oh, I got arrested.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.860
Just tell me it's not a felony.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.860
Oh, I committed the
utmost act of patriotism.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.960
So, it is a felony.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.660
It seems that, because I care
about the future of our country,

03:24.700 --> 03:28.300
because I care that the
National Debt is 9.4 trillion,

03:28.300 --> 03:32.260
because I care that 47 million Americans
are without health insurance…

03:32.300 --> 03:34.400
Just tell me what you did.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
I voted in the primary.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.400
You're 17.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.960
Oh. Yes. I'm 17;
I shouldn't get a voice.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.560
Meanwhile, Toothless-in-Podunk
who can't even read a ballot

03:43.600 --> 03:46.460
gets to decide a swing state…
that makes total sense.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.760
Oh, hey! It's the old guy!

03:47.800 --> 03:50.460
Oh, Carl. Do you think you could
help me with my granddaughter, Marlena?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.460
It seems she voted in the primary.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.700
Well, well, well, well, weeelllll. Yum.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.300
Okay. Serious ick.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.160
Denny, you remember my
granddaughter, Marlena.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.962
Ohhh. Clearly, you're as hot
as granny… are you as nasty?

04:08.400 --> 04:10.500
Very funny, Denny!

04:10.500 --> 04:13.300
Okay, you can get up
now. No, stay down.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.800
Denny.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.200
Oh, he's faking.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.600
–Denny?
–He's not breathing.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.900
Denny?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.560
He's not breathing.
–Call 9-1-1!

04:28.600 --> 04:30.800
Denny, if this is a joke…

04:32.400 --> 04:33.700
Denny!

04:35.500 --> 04:36.400
Denny!

04:44.300 --> 04:45.300
I'm fine!

04:45.300 --> 04:46.660
You're going to the hospital.

04:46.700 --> 04:47.860
I just fainted; that's all.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.760
Denny, you stopped breathing!
We had to give you mouth-to-mouth.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.600
Who gave it to me?
Shirley?

04:52.900 --> 04:53.700
Me.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.560
Oh, God! Take me to the hospital.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.900
Let's go.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.500
I'm coming with you.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.200
Just don't kiss me.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.200
Two twenty-five seems
a little low for a rape.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.560
You know what? There is no amount
of money that would be enough.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.560
A fifteen-year-old girl? A million
seems low… am I right, Jerry?

05:16.600 --> 05:19.260
Gee, I'm not sure, Mel. Why dontcha
offer a mil? I'll letcha know.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.060
You're a chip off the old hoot
block… that's what you are.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.260
You see, Mr Addario,

05:23.300 --> 05:27.660
I have to evaluate cases using your more
objective jury verdict research.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.060
Comes down to tables,
statistics, numbers.

05:30.100 --> 05:34.160
Ask me, it's offensive to quantify
something like a rape with money values,

05:34.200 --> 05:36.400
but that's the way the law works.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.760
My computation values
this case around 1.5.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.060
Hell, you must have one of
those plaintiff's calculators…

05:41.100 --> 05:41.960
that's what you must have!

05:42.000 --> 05:44.700
Maybe we should just… spin the wheel.

05:44.700 --> 05:47.960
The thing is, when I factor
in all the variables here…

05:48.000 --> 05:51.660
which I would be required to do,
you see, as defendant's counsel…

05:51.700 --> 05:55.700
225 would be the number.
All payable today, by the way.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.760
Exactly what variables do you mean?

05:57.800 --> 06:00.100
Well, do I really need to say it?

06:00.100 --> 06:01.600
Afraid you do.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.660
Okay. Obviously, Ms Addario was
quite traumatized by all this.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.760
Hell, I've never even met her,

06:06.800 --> 06:09.960
but my suspicion is settlement
conferences and the like

06:10.000 --> 06:13.560
would bring back a trauma that she
would just as soon forget… am I right?

06:13.600 --> 06:17.600
Nobody here wants to put her
through the ordeal of a trial.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.160
You know the questions
I would be obligated to ask.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.360
How she found her assailant
attractive. How she flirted with him.

06:23.400 --> 06:28.350
How she perhaps stoked the passions
that ultimately overtook his free will.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.960
There is no way in hell

06:31.000 --> 06:35.960
a loving father would ever subject her
to all the ugliness that goes with a trial,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.200
and, see, without her testimony,

06:39.200 --> 06:42.660
you'd have a hard time getting
any judgment… that's what I know.

06:42.700 --> 06:47.300
And, knowing that,
the number is 225.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.800
You're disgusting.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.100
You know, Missy,

06:54.500 --> 06:56.400
I get that a lot.

06:57.900 --> 07:03.400
I'm actually okay with it,
which is something you might consider.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.060
I mean, who wants to
subject that poor girl

07:06.100 --> 07:10.100
to a disgusting lawyer
who's willing to tear her up,

07:10.400 --> 07:15.400
and do… perhaps… irreparable
psychological damage.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.900
I certainly don't
want that. Do you?

07:25.800 --> 07:27.900
What do you mean, she voted?

07:27.900 --> 07:31.860
She falsified her birth year, registered,
and voted in the Democratic primary,

07:31.900 --> 07:34.460
and if we hadn't caught her, she
would be voting in the general election.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.160
Why don't we prosecute the
lazy asses who don't vote?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.960
Maybe charge them with dereliction
of civic duty? There's an idea.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.200
Young lady! You will
speak when spoken to.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.560
Your Honor, could we
just plea this out?

07:44.600 --> 07:48.160
Give her a fine, slap her with some
community service, and we can all go home.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.760
What kind of lawyering is that?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.160
It's not just that she voted, Judge.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.760
She has a YouTube posting where
she encourages other minors to vote,

07:54.800 --> 07:58.460
and offers instructions on how
to falsify registration forms.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.060
–One year in jail!
–What?

08:00.100 --> 08:04.390
Whoa! Now, I admittedly haven't
read all of the… the Patriot Act,

08:04.700 --> 08:09.500
but I'm pretty sure that you can't find
somebody guilty without a trial.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.200
I could be wrong.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.000
Toxic shock?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.860
Your blood tests show a
lot of drugs in your system.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.360
How many medications are you on?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.660
I dunno. Thirty, forty.

08:26.700 --> 08:27.860
–What?
–Thirty or forty?

08:27.900 --> 08:30.000
–My God!
–Is that a lot?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.360
Why are you taking them?

08:31.400 --> 08:34.299
I dunno. You name it, uh…

08:34.299 --> 08:36.900
acid reflux, weak stream,

08:36.900 --> 08:40.299
restless leg, hemorrhoids,
irritable bowel, uh,

08:40.299 --> 08:42.700
memory, cholesterol,
blood pressure.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.260
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
These drugs can interact.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.800
No; I keep them in separate bottles.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.160
Do they make one for common sense?

08:50.200 --> 08:52.460
Where the hell are you
getting your medical advice?

08:52.500 --> 08:54.060
–Television.
–Television.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.700
For God's sake, Denny!

08:55.700 --> 08:57.860
What? They wouldn't advertise
it if it wasn't safe.

08:57.900 --> 09:01.200
Mr Crane, you very nearly died.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.200
You're lucky you didn't die.

09:05.300 --> 09:08.300
Really? Whoops.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.200
After my mother died,
I started… using.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.260
I don't know if I
was addicted, but…

09:32.300 --> 09:36.128
You were arrested and convicted
for possession of cocaine?

09:36.700 --> 09:40.990
Yes. I was given two choices:
Go to a juvenile detention facility

09:41.100 --> 09:44.460
or choose the private route which
promised treatment… which we opted for.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.000
What happened at that facility?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.700
I was raped by a guard.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.700
Lauren, I know this is difficult, and…

09:54.700 --> 09:57.200
Have you ever been raped, Miss Lloyd?

09:57.200 --> 09:57.800
No.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.176
Then, please don't tell me you know.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.400
Okay. Can you try to help me…

10:04.400 --> 10:08.300
I should say, the jury…
understand what happened that day?

10:12.800 --> 10:17.600
A guard… who was not
a trained professional,

10:17.600 --> 10:20.372
but instead a “paid by
the hour” employee…

10:22.800 --> 10:24.300
came into my cell,

10:27.500 --> 10:29.700
pinned me down by my neck,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.400
pulled my pants down…

10:37.100 --> 10:39.014
Was there anyone else around?

10:41.100 --> 10:42.000
No.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.268
The others were at
recreation outside somewhere.

10:46.300 --> 10:49.100
I was held in for
disciplinary infraction.

10:49.100 --> 10:53.900
I won't pretend to know or
even imagine the horror of…

10:55.600 --> 10:59.400
May I ask: did you know this guard?

11:00.000 --> 11:00.660
I knew him.

11:00.700 --> 11:04.760
In fact, you had a rather close
friendship with him, didn't you?

11:04.800 --> 11:07.860
Obviously I didn't see him
as the monster that he was.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.000
I understand.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.700
Had you ever kissed him
before this incident?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.100
Yes.

11:16.100 --> 11:20.100
In fact, the day he came into
your cell, you two kissed…

11:21.300 --> 11:23.100
consensually. Am I right?

11:23.100 --> 11:25.100
I never consented to be raped.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.500
Of course not.

11:27.300 --> 11:31.060
You said you were held inside
for a disciplinary infraction.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.608
What was that disciplinary infraction?

11:33.900 --> 11:35.960
I went into an area where
I was not supposed to be.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.300
You snuck off to rendezvous
with this part-time guard.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.700
One last question:
during this attack,

11:48.100 --> 11:49.800
did you scream?

11:51.700 --> 11:54.260
He said if I made
a sound, he'd kill me.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.700
So you never cried out for help.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.600
Nothing further.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.060
Sue the drug company?

12:12.100 --> 12:14.260
They almost killed me!
You heard the doctor.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.000
Even so.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.860
How about I sue the one that markets 16 of
the 42 prescriptions I was taking?

12:19.900 --> 12:22.960
Denny, the question would be: how could
they predict you'd eat them like jelly beans?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.260
Alan, have you seen the television ads?

12:25.300 --> 12:26.260
Yes, I've seen them.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.160
They list out the side effects like
they're reading the telephone book,

12:29.200 --> 12:32.260
but the benefits get
all the bells and whistles.

12:32.300 --> 12:36.300
They nearly killed me.
I wanna sue.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.800
Let's get 'em.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.360
But you can't deny that
you broke the law here.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.160
Civil disobedience.
Pure and simple.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.860
It's what started this country
and one might look at me as a hero.

12:50.900 --> 12:54.900
Or one might look at you as
a person who committed a crime,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
punishable by up to 5 years in jail.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.060
Ohhh, so I can't vote, but
for the purpose of locking me up,

13:01.100 --> 13:03.960
suddenly I'm an adult.
Isn't that con-veee-nient?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.160
How fair is it for me to be excluded
from the democratic process

13:07.200 --> 13:10.660
when we make no such exclusion for drug
addicts, the mentally handicapped,

13:10.700 --> 13:14.360
or senior Floridians who
“accidentally” voted for Buchanan?

13:14.400 --> 13:17.060
Do you think that you understand
the complexities of, uh,

13:17.100 --> 13:20.360
immigration, the economic recession,
the Middle East balance of power, that the…?

13:20.400 --> 13:24.460
Oh, I think I understand it some.
Do you think most American voters do?

13:24.500 --> 13:27.460
Aren't you sick of people not
voting for a candidate because, hey,

13:27.500 --> 13:30.460
they don't think that they could have
a beer with him, or he's a lousy bowler,

13:30.500 --> 13:32.260
or her pantsuits aren't flattering?

13:32.300 --> 13:35.260
I am a lot more informed than—
–Maybe you're an exception.

13:35.300 --> 13:37.900
Most 17-year-olds are—
–Are what?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.760
How do you finish that sentence without
some little nugget of ageism?

13:40.800 --> 13:43.960
I mean, I'm old enough to be a parent.
I'm old enough to get an abortion…

13:44.000 --> 13:47.060
and that is a decision far
more complicated and difficult

13:47.100 --> 13:49.360
than making a check on
a ballot box based solely on

13:49.400 --> 13:53.960
whether there's a D or an R next to a
candidate's name, which is what most people do.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.560
I mean, you wanna give me a test?

13:55.600 --> 13:58.660
Make me take a class, make
me earn my right to vote? Fine.

13:58.700 --> 13:59.800
I'll do it.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.360
But don't just say
“No way” because I'm 17.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.900
Joan of Arc led an army
at 17, and I'm cuter. Way.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.560
What's really nauseating
is he's good.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.060
The jury seem to be with him.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.860
He's very good, but we'll get him.

14:20.900 --> 14:24.060
Wait 'til I get that defendant
on the stand. He's muffin.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.500
I mean, toast.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.860
You seem to be more confident lately.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.960
You… you merely twiddle the wooden
cigarette instead of sucking it;

14:31.000 --> 14:33.660
and in court, your hands are in your
pockets instead of on your thighs; and…

14:33.700 --> 14:36.760
and your clothes… you're
dressing more… upscale.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.100
New therapist. New Jerry.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.760
You're not gonna leave the old
Jerry completely behind, are you?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.100
No.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.960
You really think you
can get the defendant?

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
New Jerry in town.
He's bagel. Toast.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.760
We actually operate many private prisons,
as well as our juvenile detention centers.

15:06.800 --> 15:11.800
Our safety and crime record is typically
superior to the state facilities.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.060
But just to be clear, you're
in this for profit, right?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.900
Yes. We're for profit.
We're a business.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.260
There's nothing wrong with capitalism.

15:19.300 --> 15:23.560
Just the opposite: public prisons
are weighed down with bureaucracy.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.860
They have archaic civil service rules
that they have to go by. We don't.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.060
We've streamlined the entire process,

15:30.100 --> 15:33.360
right from construction,
all the way to human resources.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.360
We've even eliminated
all the red tape.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.160
Simply put: we can build a better
prison for less money, and we do.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.400
Okay, but sir, how is it…

15:41.400 --> 15:45.822
that a 15-year-old inmate could
get attacked by one of your guards?

15:46.300 --> 15:48.400
Well, this was a rogue guard.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.560
Sorry to say, but every prison…
public or private… has them.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.760
But I can tell you that
we do screen our employees.

15:54.800 --> 15:59.160
He had no history of violent or sex crime,
and there was no way to predict this.

15:59.200 --> 16:03.960
I can also tell you that our screening
process rivals or surpasses the ones

16:04.000 --> 16:06.900
used by the state operated facilities.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.900
As for rogue guards, they're
just a reality of prison life.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.860
When we say, “for profit,”
how much profit are we talking about?

16:13.900 --> 16:15.160
Objection. Relevancy.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.360
I think we'd like to explore whether these
savings afforded them a better opportunity to,

16:19.400 --> 16:22.160
say, prevent the 15-year-olds
from getting raped—

16:22.200 --> 16:23.960
Objection! That's inflammatory.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.160
Rapes are an inflammatory
thing, Mel, don't you agree?

16:26.200 --> 16:27.260
Two pops for yes.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.760
–Mr Espenson.
–Sorry, Judge;

16:28.800 --> 16:32.860
I'm a chip off the old hoot.
Exactly how much moolah do you make?

16:32.900 --> 16:36.060
We made about three hundred and
fifty million dollars this past year.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.460
That's kind of a lot.
Don't you agree, Mel?

16:38.500 --> 16:40.160
One pop; three if you love me.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.260
You throw any of it
toward training your guards?

16:42.300 --> 16:44.360
Of course we do.
 Our guards are well-trained.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.860
Well-trained⁈ As was this one…
the one who attacked my client.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.660
Mr Palmer likes to say, “Attacked.”

16:49.700 --> 16:52.660
Attack's a nice word…
our troops attack, for example.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.400
Troops are good;
attack's a good word.

16:55.400 --> 17:00.500
Much better than,
say, rape, which is ugly.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.060
Which is what happened to my client.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.460
Did you train this guard
not to rape, by the way?

17:04.500 --> 17:07.260
All of our employees,
including this one, are required to

17:07.300 --> 17:11.460
apply for correctional officer
certification within 6 months of hire,

17:11.500 --> 17:13.660
and they have another
6 months to get certified.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.660
So any employee can work for your company
for an entire year without certification.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.960
After receiving 40 hours
of annual in-service training.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.859
Forty hours. That would cover your
riots, beatings, shankings, escapes.

17:24.900 --> 17:28.460
Your employee turnover is two to three
times that of public prisons. Am I right?

17:28.500 --> 17:29.360
–Yes, but
–And your staff,

17:29.400 --> 17:30.860
like the staff of most private prisons,

17:30.900 --> 17:34.260
is 49% more likely to be assaulted
by the inmates in their charge.

17:34.300 --> 17:37.000
Well, it's not Club Med.
It is a prison.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.360
Oh, I see; we call it “prison” now,

17:38.400 --> 17:41.960
but for the purpose of getting parents to
elect your “for profit alternative,”

17:42.000 --> 17:44.900
you're a “detention
treatment facility.”

17:44.900 --> 17:47.260
That's another lovely word.
“Treatment.”

17:47.300 --> 17:49.760
It's almost as acceptable as “attack.”

17:49.800 --> 17:53.660
Doctors, for example,
like to attack diseases with treatment.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.660
Treatment, attack; attack,
treatment. Doesn't matter which way.

17:56.700 --> 18:00.700
Still sounds better
than “prison”… “rape”.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.560
Prison, prison, prison;
rape, rape, rape.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.500
–Objection.
–Here we have child rape.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.800
–Objection!
–Good that you made a profit.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.000
I'm done.

18:24.300 --> 18:29.580
Straight probation; six months. And you
take your instruction video off YouTube.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.400
No.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.060
W… wait a minute.
Did you just say, “No”?

18:35.100 --> 18:37.060
They're willing to
let you go, Marlena!

18:37.100 --> 18:39.900
This is more than just me, Grammy.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.760
I am a movement.
Millions of kids…

18:41.800 --> 18:43.900
Oh, give me a break!

18:43.900 --> 18:45.760
I would think you of
all people would understand,

18:45.800 --> 18:48.360
being a former suffragette,
that sometimes you have to stand up—

18:48.400 --> 18:51.500
The law is black…

18:51.500 --> 18:54.900
did you just call me
a former suffragette?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.400
Aren't you?

18:56.500 --> 18:59.400
How old do you think I am?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.900
I don't know. Uh, eighty?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.860
Please, leave now. And
take the window… it's faster.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.900
And you! Can't you
talk some sense into her?

19:07.900 --> 19:11.000
Actually, I think
she's right. Uh, uh…

19:11.000 --> 19:12.460
not about you being eighty,

19:12.500 --> 19:14.560
but I think she should get to vote.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.800
Excuse me?

19:15.800 --> 19:19.360
We had 10 million people without high
school diplomas vote in the last election.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.400
Why shouldn't Marlena get to vote?

19:22.400 --> 19:23.900
Carl…

19:25.000 --> 19:27.900
That's her “I'm not
happy with you” tone.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.500
Yes, I know it well.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.900
Surely you think
she should settle this case.

19:32.900 --> 19:36.900
Surely I don't… Shirley.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.960
Give me one reason why we shouldn't
countersue for abuse of process,

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
filing a frivolous lawsuit,
and, possibly, extortion.

19:49.400 --> 19:55.400
W-well, my impression of the pharmaceutical
industry is that it's always so nice.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.460
He had a scare, but he's fine now.
What are the damages?

19:59.500 --> 20:01.760
Well, emotional distress, for starters.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.000
But how did we cause it?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.160
What is it exactly
you're claiming we did?

20:06.200 --> 20:08.460
What you did? You
brainwashed my client.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.160
The massive marketing strategy
employed by your trade association

20:12.200 --> 20:15.660
caused him to gulp down of 42
different drugs on a daily basis.

20:15.700 --> 20:19.360
And it would be foreseeable in your
mind that he'd do this just because?

20:19.400 --> 20:22.760
Certainly foreseeable to you.
You market to senior citizens

20:22.800 --> 20:24.960
because your research shows
they're easy targets,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.860
susceptible to deceptive advertising—

20:26.900 --> 20:29.900
I'm sorry. You did go
to law school, right?

20:29.900 --> 20:32.260
Actually, I bought my
degree on the Internet.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.560
Uh, what's your point?

20:33.600 --> 20:36.860
What happened to him was
the product of his own stupidity.

20:36.900 --> 20:40.760
That he's able to enlist his firm and perhaps
an equally intellectually-challenged attorney

20:40.800 --> 20:44.958
to type a cause of action on a
complaint does not give him one.

20:45.700 --> 20:49.060
I bet you didn't play well
with others as a child, did you?

20:49.100 --> 20:50.100
I'm leaving.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.900
Sit your arrogant ass down, Mr Mathis.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.760
Better you hear what
I have to say now.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.260
It'll be considerably
cheaper than in court.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.760
You actually think you're
going to intimidate us?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.160
We're one of the biggest players
in the pharmaceutical industry.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.160
Do you have the slightest
sense of how powerful we are?

21:05.200 --> 21:07.100
I have a very acute sense.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.260
Last week, I took on
the tobacco industry.

21:09.300 --> 21:13.300
Imagine my surprise to discover
you two are so much alike.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.360
You both deny the damaging
health effects of your products,

21:17.400 --> 21:22.360
you both promote so-called “independent
research” which you actually finance,

21:22.400 --> 21:23.760
you both market to children,

21:23.800 --> 21:27.860
you both pour millions of dollars
into lobbying efforts to buy Congress,

21:27.900 --> 21:31.160
you both suppress information that
proves that your products kill people.

21:31.200 --> 21:35.260
The only difference I can see is that
while the FDA is hostile toward cigarettes,

21:35.300 --> 21:36.760
you they roll over for.
–Look—

21:36.800 --> 21:42.000
I know exactly how big and
powerful you are, Mr Mathis.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.060
It might do you some
good to check me out.

21:44.100 --> 21:47.060
I'm the guy who just nicked
Big Tobacco for 200 million.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.560
Now I just sit in my office
all day, twiddling my thumbs,

21:50.600 --> 21:52.260
asking myself, “Who's next?”

21:52.300 --> 21:55.000
Well, guess what?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.400
It's you.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.100
It's you.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.360
The law is the law.
She broke it.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.760
Now, since they've attempted to put the
law itself on trial here, let me defend it.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.360
There is a reason for
voting age minimums.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.000
Most kids aren't as fully
informed as Miss Hoffman is.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.600
Most kids are… well… kids,

22:29.600 --> 22:31.860
and they simply lack
the judgment and maturity.

22:31.900 --> 22:35.900
A recent poll found that
20% of students at NYU

22:35.900 --> 22:40.660
would trade their vote in the upcoming
Presidential election for an iPod Touch.

22:40.700 --> 22:43.260
Sixty-six percent would
trade it for free tuition.

22:43.300 --> 22:47.960
Kids are kids, which is why this state…
indeed, most states… set boundaries.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.760
We don't let them drink until they're
21, we don't let them have sex,

22:50.800 --> 22:53.160
we don't allow them to
enter into contracts.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.900
Is it fair that Marlena Hoffman
not be allowed to vote,

22:56.900 --> 22:59.860
given how politically
aware she is? Maybe not.

22:59.900 --> 23:03.260
But our system here has to be
what's best for the masses;

23:03.300 --> 23:05.260
specifically, what's
best for this country.

23:05.300 --> 23:08.900
Letting children vote
doesn't serve that goal.

23:08.900 --> 23:13.058
I salute Marlena Hoffman and her civic
commitment. I really do.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.260
She just has to wait another year.

23:15.300 --> 23:19.300
Now I know that to her, that
probably seems like a lifetime.

23:20.300 --> 23:23.200
After all, she's a kid.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.900
What's the fear? That
they'll screw things up?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.700
We have a 9.4 trillion dollar debt,

23:30.700 --> 23:34.960
no national health care, unprecedented
poverty, capped by a recession,

23:35.000 --> 23:39.660
a war that could last a hundred years
depending on who wins this election,

23:39.700 --> 23:41.060
an Earth that is dying.

23:41.100 --> 23:42.200
Oh, yes; please

23:42.200 --> 23:45.660
let's not dare let the young people
mess with our masterpiece!

23:45.700 --> 23:49.700
Oh, come on, Mr Suck. Don't
you think this is ridiculous?

23:49.700 --> 23:53.400
At first, I did.
By the way: it's Sack.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.900
But, the more I listen
to Ms Hoffman…

23:58.400 --> 24:01.160
Children aren't just our future,
Judge; they're our best hope.

24:01.200 --> 24:05.700
We need them involved, on board,
with an appreciation of the stakes.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.400
This young lady is.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.260
Come on! You're talking about
electing our Commander-in-Chief!

24:10.300 --> 24:12.200
Yes, I am.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.860
You know what? Let's face it:

24:13.900 --> 24:17.460
these elections are typically decided
by old coots like you and me. Why?

24:17.500 --> 24:22.360
Well, because not only do senior citizens
historically swing elections with their votes,

24:22.400 --> 24:26.000
we have the most money to
stuff the campaign coffers.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.960
McCain and Obama certainly know that.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.460
How else are you to explain
their deafening silence on

24:30.500 --> 24:33.300
what may be our biggest
fiscal nightmare…

24:33.300 --> 24:39.600
that more and more of the federal budget
now goes to subsidizing old people?

24:39.600 --> 24:44.700
Medicare, Medicaid, and Social
Security now take up 40%,

24:44.700 --> 24:48.960
and spending on these programs is expected
to double over the next ten years⁈

24:49.000 --> 24:51.060
As far as what the
kids get, well, let's see.

24:51.100 --> 24:54.300
Failing educational systems,
a broken economy,

24:54.300 --> 24:58.160
don't forget the backdoor draft
to get them to fight our wars.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.960
The kids are getting screwed.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.760
There are millions of them on high
school and college campuses

25:02.800 --> 25:05.760
who are informed, passionate—
–Oh, for God's sake!

25:05.800 --> 25:08.860
You might also consider,
Judge, that teenagers spend

25:08.900 --> 25:14.700
over one hundred and seventy-six billion
dollars a year of their own money…

25:14.700 --> 25:16.860
over one hundred and
seventy-six billion!

25:16.900 --> 25:18.400
They earn it.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.400
They file tax returns.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.100
To tax them while not
letting them vote⁈

25:23.100 --> 25:25.960
That amounts to taxation
without representation!

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
I think we started a Revolutionary
War to right that wrong.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.900
Finally, Your Honor…

25:37.900 --> 25:39.060
I hesitate to say this,

25:39.100 --> 25:42.500
but the resistance to
letting young people vote

25:42.500 --> 25:47.900
may be more insidious and subtle than,
“Gee, they lack the maturity.”

25:48.400 --> 25:53.800
We have an ugly legacy in this country
of excluding certain segments of society.

25:53.800 --> 25:57.160
There are women alive today who
were once denied the right to vote.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.260
Even after African-Americans
were given the right,

26:00.300 --> 26:02.460
many were subjected
to literacy tests,

26:02.500 --> 26:08.060
like in Alabama, where blacks had to determine
the number of bubbles in a bar of soap

26:08.100 --> 26:09.960
before they could cast their ballot.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.900
Today, States are passing voter ID
laws, requiring proof of citizenship.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.060
Makes sense on one level,

26:16.100 --> 26:20.192
but the net effect is that many
US-born citizens will lose out

26:20.600 --> 26:24.100
because they're too poor
to afford the documentation.

26:24.100 --> 26:28.100
Millions of felons can't
vote… also makes sense,

26:28.700 --> 26:30.560
except when you consider that

26:30.600 --> 26:37.800
13% of the US black male population
fall into that category…

26:37.800 --> 26:40.200
the poor, the black, the young.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.560
Now, a nutty Reverend
may have been right

26:42.600 --> 26:47.260
when he said that this country is ruled
by the old, the white, and the rich.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.600
So, you don't favor
any age requirements?

26:51.200 --> 26:53.100
Lower it to 17.

26:53.100 --> 26:57.160
Nineteen US States are considering
legislation to lower the voting age.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.300
Why?

26:58.500 --> 27:00.100
Because it's time.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.500
Our kids are educated.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.500
They can be passionate, socially aware.

27:05.500 --> 27:09.500
I mean they have an idealism
many of us have forgotten.

27:10.500 --> 27:14.500
They have a voice; it's
time we let it be heard.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.600
Not just for their sakes,
but for ours.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.360
We going into court?

27:37.400 --> 27:39.060
They filed a motion to dismiss.

27:39.100 --> 27:39.860
Can we beat it?

27:39.900 --> 27:43.200
Well, it's a pretty
powerful industry, Denny.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.860
Do I have to give you
my big pep talk again?

27:45.900 --> 27:47.800
No. They almost killed you.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.800
You can consider me
sufficiently motivated.

27:53.400 --> 27:57.800
Oh, Denny, please
don't… hug me.

28:01.600 --> 28:05.900
All right. Look, I'm kind
of a simple guy, I admit.

28:05.900 --> 28:09.960
When I get a case, I just plop down with
the complaint, a cheeseburger and a pop,

28:10.000 --> 28:15.400
and I try to decipher what the thing
is really about… that's what I do.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.360
And I must tell you, I'm
a little bit stumped here.

28:18.400 --> 28:22.400
I mean, it can't be a straight
negligence thing, can it?

28:22.700 --> 28:27.060
First, it wasn't foreseeable that this
guard would commit a sexual assault.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.160
He sure as hell never did it before.

28:29.200 --> 28:34.260
Second, the prison's operating procedures
were consistent with industry standards.

28:34.300 --> 28:38.560
Third, the plaintiff herself would
be deemed contributorily negligent

28:38.600 --> 28:41.760
since she cultivated a sexual
relationship with this man.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.560
She broke prison rules to be with him.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.800
Hell, she kissed him!

28:45.800 --> 28:52.000
That's probably why they decided to make
this a referendum on private prisons.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.600
Better target 'cause ”for profit“
translates to ”greed and avarice,“

28:56.600 --> 29:01.400
and we love taking the deep
pockets down a notch, don't we?

29:01.400 --> 29:06.000
But, folks, private
prisons are a good thing.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.560
Not only do they save taxpayers
money, they make us safer.

29:09.600 --> 29:13.260
Their recidivism rates are lower
than the state-run facilities.

29:13.300 --> 29:16.060
They also create jobs
and help the economy.

29:16.100 --> 29:20.500
I'm sorry, but you just can't
make a goat of private prisons.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.200
If anything, we need more of 'em.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.400
Now…

29:25.500 --> 29:29.300
a horrible thing happened
here. No question.

29:29.300 --> 29:33.460
And blame was assessed. The rogue
guard was arrested and locked up.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.100
Justice was done.

29:35.100 --> 29:40.900
This is a civil trial, which is trying
to find a correctional facility guilty

29:40.900 --> 29:46.400
when they did everything right,
according to industry standards.

29:47.900 --> 29:51.900
That's… just… the truth.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.900
Have we all gone completely mad?

30:19.900 --> 30:24.500
One in a hundred people in
this country are in prison or jail.

30:24.700 --> 30:29.360
The United States has more people locked
up than any other country in the world…

30:29.400 --> 30:31.200
that includes China.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.560
For a nation that bills
itself as the Land of the Free,

30:34.600 --> 30:37.300
America quite fancies its slammers.

30:37.300 --> 30:38.960
And with alarming recidivism rates,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.560
do we really mean to turn this problem
over to the for-profit corporations

30:42.600 --> 30:46.160
whose very economic survival
depends on people going to prison?

30:46.200 --> 30:48.960
Are we really to believe that
they'll rehabilitate their inmates

30:49.000 --> 30:51.460
when they have a profit
motive not to do so?

30:51.500 --> 30:54.360
If people don't commit crimes,
they're out of business.

30:54.400 --> 30:58.060
You have a cynical view of human nature…
that's what you have, little lady.

30:58.100 --> 31:01.000
Mr Palmer, with all due
respect to the fact

31:01.000 --> 31:04.260
that you are far simpler than
any of us could aspire to be,

31:04.300 --> 31:07.560
I shall ask you to never… ever…
call me “little lady” again.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.400
As for human nature, we saw
it in Iraq with Blackwater.

31:11.400 --> 31:16.560
Private corporations hired to protect our
troops chose not to use armored vehicles,

31:16.600 --> 31:18.960
even though the contract
expressly provided for them.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.700
Soldiers died because
some executive decided,

31:22.700 --> 31:25.000
“Better to save money than lives.”

31:25.000 --> 31:27.460
That's what you get with
for-profit corporations.

31:27.500 --> 31:31.100
They never keep ledger sheets
showing the human cost.

31:31.100 --> 31:37.100
Our prison system releases six hundred and
fifty thousand ex-convicts a year into society.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.360
Two-thirds of those quickly
commit crimes and return.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.900
That's good for the
for-profit prison business.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.960
Very bad for the welfare
of our citizenry,

31:46.000 --> 31:51.082
and if we go with this system that
disincentivizes rehabilitation, then what?

31:51.300 --> 31:54.300
We've already got 2.2
million people in jail.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.460
In fact, many jails
have to release criminals

31:56.500 --> 31:58.960
because there is simply
no place to put them.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.460
Corners get cut, costs get shaved,
officer training is short-changed,

32:03.500 --> 32:07.400
and suddenly we have children
who are first-time offenders

32:07.400 --> 32:11.200
being physically attacked
by corrections officers.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.600
Mr Palmer claims his client
observed industry standards,

32:16.100 --> 32:19.960
yet his client held himself up
as being above those very standards.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.360
The reason Lauren Addario
elected to go to this facility

32:23.400 --> 32:27.860
is because it promised a safer
environment where she would get treatment.

32:27.900 --> 32:33.900
But whatever standard of care one seeks
to hold a public or private prison up to,

32:34.000 --> 32:41.000
it should be one that safeguards against
its 15-year-old girls being raped by guards.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.800
All rise.

33:14.700 --> 33:18.700
All right. I did a little research
of my own last night.

33:18.800 --> 33:22.000
I learned that our brain
size peaks at 14,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.600
and our reasoning abilities peak at 12.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.560
I also discovered that in
pre-industrial society,

33:27.600 --> 33:30.260
which didn't even have
a word for adolescence,

33:30.300 --> 33:34.800
that post-pubescent teens
are considered adults.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.060
In fact, psychologists say that,

33:36.100 --> 33:39.060
by imposing all the restrictions
that we do on teenagers,

33:39.100 --> 33:44.400
we are infantilizing them… part of
our grand scheme to extend childhood.

33:44.400 --> 33:48.360
Many others say that the only solution
to teenage angst and irresponsibility

33:48.400 --> 33:51.960
is to go in the opposite direction,
and treat them as grown-ups.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.300
Can't he just say that I
won, and be done with it?

33:55.900 --> 33:59.900
I cannot give you
the right to vote,

33:59.900 --> 34:03.700
but I am satisfied that
your actions were… were noble,

34:03.700 --> 34:06.860
they were overt, they did not
rise to the level of fraud,

34:06.900 --> 34:10.699
and therefore I am dismissing
all criminal charges.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.600
We are adjourned.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.460
Very good job, Mr Old Guy.

34:17.500 --> 34:20.560
I mean, I can almost see what
Grammy finds attractive about you.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.400
Marlena, you're not nearly as cute

34:24.400 --> 34:26.643
or obnoxious as you think you are.

34:27.100 --> 34:31.100
What I will say is: pretty cool kid.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.628
You won't tell Grammy? I kinda
like getting on her nerves.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.500
Secret's safe.

34:45.699 --> 34:48.960
He's failed to state a claim
even suggesting liability.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.159
How is it foreseeable to us that
he would gobble multiple medications,

34:52.199 --> 34:55.760
buying them off the Internet, without
even consulting a doctor in person?

34:55.800 --> 34:58.160
It's not just foreseeable,
it's exactly what you count on!

34:58.200 --> 35:02.460
Seducing the more vulnerable members of
society to fall for your snake oil potions.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.460
Oh, that's just absurd!

35:03.500 --> 35:08.060
Your Honor, hundreds of thousands of people
die every year from prescription drugs.

35:08.100 --> 35:11.260
Twentyseven thousand people
were killed by Vioxx.

35:11.300 --> 35:14.060
If you believe one FDA
official, possibly 50,000.

35:14.100 --> 35:16.760
Yes. But you can't sue
these people for Vioxx.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.160
This isn't about Vioxx, which
they don't even manufacture.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.200
I'm talking about an
industry-wide pattern.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.560
We don't even know all the
potential dangers of these drugs,

35:25.600 --> 35:29.060
because the pharmaceutical industry
systematically conceals them.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.660
They've been caught
buying clinical trials,

35:31.700 --> 35:33.960
bribing doctors, distorting science.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.260
Many of these so-called “peer-reviewed”
articles we see in medical journals

35:38.300 --> 35:40.760
are actually ghost-written by
the drug companies themselves,

35:40.800 --> 35:44.460
and doctors take pay-offs and let
their names appear as the authors.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.360
You have no evidence that any
of that has happened here.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.360
Because you hide it!

35:47.400 --> 35:49.560
Your company previously buried evidence

35:49.600 --> 35:53.060
which showed a link between antidepressants
and suicidal thoughts in children.

35:53.100 --> 35:53.560
You did that.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.860
Which we still deny.
And this isn't that case.

35:55.900 --> 35:57.560
He doesn't have one
single fact to support…

35:57.600 --> 36:00.600
The fact is: the US
pharmaceutical industry

36:00.600 --> 36:04.760
spends almost twice as much on promotion
as it does on research and development.

36:04.800 --> 36:05.800
That's obscene!

36:05.800 --> 36:09.300
American television viewers
see as much as 16 hours

36:09.300 --> 36:11.860
of prescription drug advertising
each year.

36:11.900 --> 36:15.860
Sixteen hours! That's more time than
most people spend at the movies.

36:15.900 --> 36:19.800
The fact is: they invent
diseases, like social phobia,

36:19.800 --> 36:23.600
generalized anxiety disorder
to sell mind-altering drugs—

36:23.600 --> 36:25.700
Anxiety is a clinical illness.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.260
To suggest otherwise is not
only irresponsible, Your Honor—

36:28.300 --> 36:32.060
What's irresponsible is: we have
scores of people being diagnosed

36:32.100 --> 36:35.460
with these vague mental disorders,
millions of whom are children.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.760
What's irresponsible is: we have
3-year-olds on antidepressants.

36:38.800 --> 36:42.160
Why? Because the drug companies…
just like Big Tobacco… know

36:42.200 --> 36:45.060
that if you get these kids when they're
young enough, you have a customer for life.

36:45.100 --> 36:47.160
I should sue you right now.
You do not get a pass just

36:47.200 --> 36:47.660
because…
–You want to sue me?

36:47.700 --> 36:52.060
Please do. Because truth is a complete defense,
and I'm not the only one saying this.

36:52.100 --> 36:57.182
This industry invents chronic diseases,
be it restless leg, dry eye syndrome,

36:57.800 --> 37:03.360
or these unspecified sleep disorders
that require taking nightly doses
of habit-forming tranquilizers.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.560
They first concoct the
disorder, next the drug,

37:05.600 --> 37:09.260
and then they blitz the public with
commercials to convince 'em they're afflicted,

37:09.300 --> 37:11.360
and it's especially effective
with senior citizens.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.360
My client was popping pills
like candy. He almost died!

37:14.400 --> 37:15.360
He's out of control.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.460
Your industry is out of control.

37:17.500 --> 37:21.500
You manufacture and sell
disease at exorbitant cost.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.360
And the FDA refuses
to regulate you.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.060
The pharmaceutical lobby has
a death grip on Congress.

37:26.100 --> 37:29.200
Mr Shore, you need
to settle down.

37:33.200 --> 37:37.820
Your Honor, the FDA refuses to go
after these people, so let it be me.

37:37.900 --> 37:40.460
They very nearly killed
a man I dearly love.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.500
Let it be me.

37:41.500 --> 37:46.360
But let me get started, because they stall.
Of the 27,000 to 50,000 Vioxx deaths,

37:46.400 --> 37:50.600
only 18 cases have
reached juries so far… 18.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.160
Most of the plaintiffs will in fact be
dead before they're compensated in any way.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.400
Well, my client is 75.

37:56.400 --> 38:00.160
So, please, let me get started on discovery,
since clearly I'll need every second.

38:00.200 --> 38:03.360
All right; all right.
I will let this case stand.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.300
What⁈ Are you crazy?

38:05.300 --> 38:06.660
Perhaps you could have
a pill she could take.

38:06.700 --> 38:09.560
You're allowing him to go
forward with no proximate cause?

38:09.600 --> 38:10.760
That's preposterous.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.560
What would be preposterous, sir,

38:12.600 --> 38:16.360
is if I would extend the benefit
of the doubt to your industry.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.560
Do I look like an idiot?

38:17.600 --> 38:18.660
They've got a pill for that, too.

38:18.700 --> 38:19.560
Will you shut up?

38:19.600 --> 38:22.700
I have made my ruling.
We are adjourned.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.360
You've bitten off more than you
can chew this time, my friend.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.760
Oh, I don't swallow.
I just chew up and spit out.

38:29.800 --> 38:30.600
We'll see.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.000
Zing. I can see you're good at this.

38:40.300 --> 38:44.200
Nervous, Jerry?
Interesting cross of yours.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.660
Little piece of advice, my friend:

38:45.700 --> 38:50.300
never, ever, get up in court
and try to “out-me” me.

38:50.300 --> 38:54.000
All right, Mr Foreman; the
jury has reached its verdict?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.260
We have, Judge.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.700
What say you?

38:57.400 --> 39:00.860
In the matter of Lauren Addario vs
Superior Correctional Centers,

39:00.900 --> 39:03.460
we the jury find in
favor of the plaintiff,

39:03.500 --> 39:07.160
and order the defendant to pay
damages in the amount of $1.7 million.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.800
Defense appeals, Judge.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.260
So noted. Members of the jury:
thank you for your service.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.200
The judgment is entered.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.200
This matter is adjourned.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.000
You did it.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.684
Congratulations, Lauren.

39:20.000 --> 39:20.800
Thank you.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.200
Thank you.

39:22.900 --> 39:24.600
Can't win 'em all, Mel.

39:24.600 --> 39:28.400
Hey! Can you win any?
Two pops for yes, bro.

39:31.900 --> 39:34.960
Jerry, in England, we're
taught to be gracious in victory.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I couldn't help it.
He's a big boob-head.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.560
Well, congratulations. It seems
your cross carried the day.

39:40.600 --> 39:44.824
No; it was your closing.
It was as persuasive as it was elegant.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.700
I guess we make quite a team,
you and me.. as… as colleagues.

39:49.700 --> 39:52.800
Of course. Absolutely.
As colleagues.

40:04.600 --> 40:08.230
Last week, Big Tobacco.
This week, Big Pharmaceuticals.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.560
Well, why not go out swinging, right?

40:10.600 --> 40:12.700
Who says we're going out?

40:12.700 --> 40:15.860
I read somewhere you should
live every year as if it's your last.

40:15.900 --> 40:19.300
Really? I can't imagine
this is our last year.

40:19.300 --> 40:22.732
Aren't there still some
time slots we haven't tried?

40:24.900 --> 40:27.900
Do you ever think about
the end, Denny?

40:28.700 --> 40:29.700
Death?

40:29.900 --> 40:34.784
I feel somehow I'll just keep going
on even after it's over… like Hillary.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.900
Reincarnation. You believe in that?

40:38.900 --> 40:41.600
I do, actually.
What's the alternative?

40:41.600 --> 40:44.700
Nothingness?
I can't believe in that.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.200
No.

40:47.700 --> 40:50.200
You believe in reincarnation?

40:50.200 --> 40:51.200
I don't know.

40:51.600 --> 40:55.360
I suppose if I ever did get to Heaven,
God would almost certainly return me.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.800
True.

40:57.400 --> 41:01.300
What do you think you'll
be in your next life?

41:01.300 --> 41:03.860
I hope a beautiful woman.
I could touch myself.

41:03.900 --> 41:05.460
I might want to touch you.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.360
You've already had your kiss.
How was it for you?

41:08.400 --> 41:09.500
I've had better.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.460
You didn't tongue me, did you?

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
Oh, God…

41:15.600 --> 41:17.700
I must say,

41:20.000 --> 41:25.400
I feel… great comfort,
the way you're there for me.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.618
When the day does come,

41:28.900 --> 41:30.900
at least I won't be alone.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.300
You won't be alone.

41:35.900 --> 41:38.460
You know, if we are to think
of it as our last year,

41:38.500 --> 41:41.300
we need to think of
how best to go out.

41:41.300 --> 41:42.160
Fishing, for sure.

41:42.200 --> 41:42.800
For sure.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.060
Supreme Court… gotta go back.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.600
Scalia misses me.

41:45.600 --> 41:46.900
Shirley.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.400
Once with Shirley before I go.

41:52.300 --> 41:55.060
I can't believe you actually
got to suck face with me.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.760
And I brought you back to life.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.800
Like Snow White.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.100
Like Snow White.

42:02.400 --> 42:06.100
Of all the women I have
loved, been loved by…

42:06.100 --> 42:10.760
whoever would have believed that Alan
Shore would be my Prince Charming?

42:10.800 --> 42:12.600
Let no man tear asunder.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.000
Till death do us part.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.700
Amen.
