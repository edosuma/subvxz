00:02.584 --> 00:04.377
I give you the product
that will carry Hooli

00:04.668 --> 00:07.252
to complete market dominance.

00:09.377 --> 00:13.210
It looks like a penis.
-Yes... Yes, it does.

00:13.876 --> 00:15.918
So, we're giving
a random company

00:15.918 --> 00:18.043
a bunch of free
compute power in our network?

00:18.043 --> 00:19.043
BERTRAM GILFOYLE:
The AI company?

00:19.293 --> 00:22.543
I made her! I can do
anything I want with her!

00:23.043 --> 00:24.626
Ugh. Gross.

00:25.001 --> 00:28.043
Can you please tell me
what you are going to do

00:28.043 --> 00:30.335
about this
Jian Yang situation?

00:30.709 --> 00:31.751
Yes. Nothing.

00:32.085 --> 00:36.210
"I went to China to do
new new internet. Jian Yang."

00:46.001 --> 00:47.584
Richard:
This went up yesterday.

00:47.584 --> 00:50.293
A fake Pied Piper.
This is Jian-Yang, not us.

00:50.293 --> 00:52.085
Richard, he has a website.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.501
Okay?
He doesn't
have a product.

00:53.501 --> 00:54.960
Just post a cease
and desist

00:54.960 --> 00:56.918
on your own website
and move on.

00:56.918 --> 00:58.293
We need action.

00:58.293 --> 01:01.127
I wanna move up our launch
so we can beat
this asshole to market.

01:01.127 --> 01:05.543
We need money.
So, how quickly can we
get a series B together?

01:05.543 --> 01:08.584
Richard, a series B
is not a done deal.

01:08.584 --> 01:10.543
And Laurie's not gonna be
able to weigh in on this

01:10.543 --> 01:12.418
until she's done sorting
things out over at Eklow.

01:12.418 --> 01:13.584
Why is she still over there?

01:13.584 --> 01:16.918
We put 112 million
of our dollars into a company

01:16.918 --> 01:20.252
whose creepy CEO just fled
with its most valuable asset.

01:20.252 --> 01:23.252
Ariel and that robot
could be anywhere.

01:23.252 --> 01:24.960
Ariel fucked us too, remember?

01:24.960 --> 01:27.668
I just had my whole company
on a three-day code sprint

01:27.668 --> 01:28.960
to repair all the holes

01:28.960 --> 01:30.501
and un-fuck all
the damage he did.

01:30.501 --> 01:32.668
Besides,
Laurie doesn't work at Eklow.

01:32.668 --> 01:34.501
She works here,
with you and me.

01:34.501 --> 01:35.960
True,

01:35.960 --> 01:38.210
but also not true.

01:38.210 --> 01:42.127
Look, Laurie has
installed herself
as Eklow's interim CEO.

01:42.127 --> 01:43.501
What?

01:43.501 --> 01:45.793
Laurie, Ariel encrypted
all of his files.

01:45.793 --> 01:46.960
We can't open
any of them.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.960
Ah, understood.
Keep trying, please.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.960
I spoke with the bank.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.001
We're not gonna
make payroll.

01:52.001 --> 01:55.252
Noted. Thank you
for your diligence.
People are pretty upset.

01:55.252 --> 01:57.001
Somebody shattered
the toilet.

01:57.001 --> 01:58.043
Ah, yes, well,
we'll certainly

01:58.043 --> 01:59.793
have to get that
repaired, won't we?

02:01.418 --> 02:03.127
Good work, you two.

Yes?

Well, fortunately, you're
the same size as the robot.

02:52.043 --> 02:55.210
Richard,
the position of CEO is...

02:55.210 --> 02:56.418
taxing.

02:56.418 --> 02:58.377
It isn't easy, is it?

02:58.377 --> 03:00.960
I think perhaps I may have

03:00.960 --> 03:04.043
treated you unfairly
in the past.

03:04.043 --> 03:05.418
Oh..

03:06.418 --> 03:07.960
Well...

03:07.960 --> 03:11.043

a couple-- yeah.
Sure. Thank you.

Thank you for
saying that, yeah.

Yao:
Things are changing
in China now, Gavin.

03:39.835 --> 03:41.709
There are many reforms.

03:41.709 --> 03:43.835
As you see,
we provide a series

03:43.835 --> 03:45.835
of Tai Chi

Sorry?
If I wanted to see
nap pods

04:08.960 --> 04:11.085
and climbing walls,
I would've stayed home,

04:11.085 --> 04:12.293

04:17.459 --> 04:18.668
This is the new China.

04:18.668 --> 04:22.459
We found that the more humane
work environment we have,

04:22.459 --> 04:24.418
the more
sustainable over time.

04:24.418 --> 04:25.793
Over time? No, no.

Since the renovation,
not a single one.

Gavin:
Not even one?

04:43.668 --> 04:45.001
Okay.

Richard, I am pleased to say

05:43.876 --> 05:46.168
that your new assistant
is a quick study.

05:46.168 --> 05:49.043
And per your text,
he posted a well-crafted
cease and desist

05:49.043 --> 05:52.001
directed at Jian-Yang
on the Pied Piper website.

05:52.001 --> 05:54.876
I made some judicious edits
to capture your voice,

05:54.876 --> 05:57.876
but the thrust
of the piece was his.

05:57.876 --> 05:59.210

05:59.210 --> 06:00.418
Well done, Holden.

06:00.418 --> 06:01.793
Is that tea for me?

06:01.793 --> 06:03.377
It is, indeed.
Okay. Great.

06:03.377 --> 06:04.543
No, no, no, no, don't.

06:04.543 --> 06:05.626
It's too strong.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.543
Okay.
Water it down.

06:10.543 --> 06:14.210
So, did you speak to Laurie
about our series B?

06:14.210 --> 06:15.210
Sort of.

06:15.210 --> 06:17.584
Uh, Gilfoyle, is there
a secure way

06:17.584 --> 06:20.418
of giving someone
access to our servers

06:20.418 --> 06:22.459
while still limiting
and controlling

06:22.459 --> 06:23.709
how much compute
they could use?

06:23.709 --> 06:25.501
I could create
a credit system.

06:25.501 --> 06:28.252
Wait, I'm sorry, Richard.
Who would these credits be for?

06:28.252 --> 06:31.001
Laurie Bream.
She made herself
CEO of Eklow.

06:31.001 --> 06:32.418
I'm just trying
to help her out.

06:32.418 --> 06:34.918
Pardon?
Do you think you could
set those up by today?

06:34.918 --> 06:36.418
More work. Fantastic.

06:36.418 --> 06:38.418
Richard, I don't
quite understand...

06:38.418 --> 06:39.626
Dinesh:
Done!

06:39.626 --> 06:42.751
Done! I am done!

06:45.668 --> 06:46.918
Look at this!

06:46.918 --> 06:48.876
Whoo!

06:48.876 --> 06:50.501
Code sprint over.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.459
Uh, congratulations, everybody.

07:00.459 --> 07:01.584
Really, good-- good job.

07:01.584 --> 07:05.210
Um, the only thing
left to do now is...

07:05.210 --> 07:09.584
get back to work
and review all the code
for errors.

07:09.584 --> 07:11.001
Okay, so...

07:12.459 --> 07:13.418
Okay.

07:13.418 --> 07:15.001
That was an
out-of-body experience.

07:15.001 --> 07:17.543
It was like God
was coding through me.

07:17.543 --> 07:18.709
Time stood still.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.335
Not for the rest of us
it didn't.

07:20.335 --> 07:21.960
Laugh it up, Gilf.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.584
I hear you making
your little jokes
at my expense,

07:24.584 --> 07:26.709
turning all the engineers
against me.

07:26.709 --> 07:29.459
But the second
these results go up,

07:29.459 --> 07:33.252
they're all going to see
the only thing that matters--

07:33.252 --> 07:35.085
Who made less errors.

07:35.085 --> 07:37.043
You mean who made
"fewer" errors?

07:37.043 --> 07:38.835
Oh, you think
you're so clever.

07:38.835 --> 07:40.543
You know who else
thought it was clever?

07:40.543 --> 07:41.543
The hare.

07:41.543 --> 07:44.168
Right before it was defeated
by the tortoise.

07:44.168 --> 07:46.168
I'm the fucking tortoise,
Gilfoyle.

07:46.168 --> 07:48.918
I'm the fucking tortoise!
Keep saying that.

07:48.918 --> 07:50.668
I can't wait
for these results
to go up.

07:50.668 --> 07:53.709
Guys? No, no, no.
We talked about this.
Remember?

07:53.709 --> 07:55.043
You're both
senior management now.

07:55.043 --> 07:57.668
Okay? Your code will be
subject to private review.

07:57.668 --> 07:59.543
No. No, no, no,
not private.

07:59.543 --> 08:01.418
Everyone has to know that
I'm better than Gilfoyle.

08:01.418 --> 08:03.252
I'm sorry.
When it was just us,

08:03.252 --> 08:05.751
a little cocksmanship
was a fun diversion.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.001
But the entire
engineering team's morale

08:08.001 --> 08:10.835
depends on seeing you both
as equally competent leaders.

08:10.835 --> 08:13.168
Danny over there is going
to be reviewing your code,

08:13.168 --> 08:15.793
and keeping the results
completely confidential.

08:16.835 --> 08:18.085
Jared...

08:18.085 --> 08:21.876
I believe we all know
who's the better coder anyway.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.459
Um, Richard?

08:23.459 --> 08:27.043
I'm sorry, I'm still having
a little bit of a hard time
understanding.

08:27.043 --> 08:29.918
You went to see Laurie
to get money from her

08:29.918 --> 08:33.501
but now you're giving
our resources to her.

08:33.501 --> 08:34.876
Why would you do that?

08:34.876 --> 08:37.918
Well, honestly Jared,
she was a mess.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.876
And I really,
genuinely felt bad for her.

08:41.876 --> 08:43.210
For Laurie?

08:44.335 --> 08:45.377
Yup.

08:48.085 --> 08:51.751
Richard, you have
an enormous heart.

08:51.751 --> 08:56.043
And I don't mean in the same way
my deceased friend Gloria did,

08:56.043 --> 08:58.043
which the doctors should
have really caught

08:58.043 --> 09:00.293
because her knuckles
were gargantuan.

09:00.293 --> 09:02.501
But do you think
in this instance,

09:02.501 --> 09:04.501
you might have
allowed your emotions

09:04.501 --> 09:06.668
to cloud your
business instincts?

09:06.668 --> 09:10.085
Well, I would argue that I made
a very good business decision.

09:10.085 --> 09:12.168
Because now,
Laurie is on our side.

09:12.168 --> 09:15.751
Which will play out very nicely
when we negotiate our series B.

09:15.751 --> 09:17.459
Okay, Richard,
it is important

09:17.459 --> 09:20.751
to develop emotional
self-discipline
for situations like this.

09:20.751 --> 09:23.418
Mm-hmm.
Sometimes you have
to numb yourself.

09:23.418 --> 09:24.751
If you wanna work the corner,

09:24.751 --> 09:26.918
you can't fall in love
every time you turn a trick.

09:26.918 --> 09:28.293
That's why you do the oxy.

09:28.293 --> 09:31.459
What I'm saying is
if you ever need
to develop strategies

09:31.459 --> 09:34.085
to cultivate more
emotional self-control,

09:34.085 --> 09:36.960
obviously I do have
some experience.
You do?

09:36.960 --> 09:38.210
Doubtless you've noticed

09:38.210 --> 09:40.001
that I've been pulling
away from you.

09:40.001 --> 09:43.584
Uh, no-- no, I can't...
honestly say that I have.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.501
Look at Holden out there.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.043
You think I didn't
love making your tea?

09:48.043 --> 09:49.168
Who wouldn't?

09:49.168 --> 09:50.960
But, when you
anointed me COO,

09:50.960 --> 09:54.459
I learned to stop investing
those feelings in you

09:54.459 --> 09:56.626
for the good of the company.

09:56.626 --> 09:58.960
Call it emotional abstinence.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.043
Jared, look, um,

10:00.043 --> 10:01.793
in regards to
the whole Laurie thing,

10:01.793 --> 10:03.751
I actually think
I made the right call.

10:03.751 --> 10:04.835
Alright.
Alright.

10:04.835 --> 10:07.876
Well, I am available.

10:07.876 --> 10:10.459
Not emotionally, obviously.

10:11.793 --> 10:12.876
Got it.

10:15.501 --> 10:18.751
Ooh, there's a highly rated
new dim sum establishment

10:18.751 --> 10:19.751
in this neighborhood.

10:19.751 --> 10:21.501
Sir, Richard Hendricks
just posted

10:21.501 --> 10:23.377
a cease and desist letter.

10:23.377 --> 10:26.960
"...unlawful copying
of Pied Piper's
proprietary software."

10:26.960 --> 10:28.584
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:28.584 --> 10:30.751
That idiot let someone
steal his code,

10:30.751 --> 10:32.543
so now there might
be two companies

10:32.543 --> 10:34.335
working to make
my box obsolete?

10:34.335 --> 10:36.377
I'll try to find out
who's responsible.

10:36.377 --> 10:40.210
Good luck.
HooliMaps says
dim sum is that way.

10:40.210 --> 10:41.626
Right turn, please.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.377
Gavin:
Look! Pied Piper!

10:53.377 --> 10:54.626
Follow that Chinese man.

10:55.501 --> 10:57.418
The Chinese man
on the bicycle.

10:57.418 --> 11:00.543
The Chinese man on the bicycle
in the green Pied Piper t-shirt.

11:00.543 --> 11:01.668
Ah.

11:01.668 --> 11:03.835
Gavin:
Hurry, hurry!
Come on! Don't lose him.

11:10.168 --> 11:11.668
Hey dude, how's it goin'?

11:11.668 --> 11:14.543
How's that... review going?

11:14.543 --> 11:15.835
Probably done, right?

11:15.835 --> 11:17.293
'Cause it took you no time

11:17.293 --> 11:19.043
counting up the bugs
in my stuff?

11:19.043 --> 11:21.543
'Cause I crushed it so hard?

11:22.876 --> 11:24.168
Compared to Gilfoyle?

11:25.377 --> 11:26.377
Right?

11:29.127 --> 11:31.543
I get it. I get it.
It's a secret.

11:31.543 --> 11:33.835
Company morale.
I'm so on board.

11:34.876 --> 11:36.252
I did crush him, right?

11:38.043 --> 11:39.501
He did better than me?

11:39.501 --> 11:40.584
Oh my God.

11:40.584 --> 11:42.709
This is my worst
fucking nightmare.

11:42.709 --> 11:44.335
But not by a lot, right?

11:44.335 --> 11:45.918
He didn't like kick my ass?

11:47.751 --> 11:49.210
He kicked my ass?

11:49.210 --> 11:50.751
That fucker!

11:50.751 --> 11:52.377
Just fucking tell me.

11:52.377 --> 11:54.543
Just fucking tell me
how much he kicked my ass by.

11:54.543 --> 11:56.043
Please just fucking tell me.

11:56.043 --> 11:58.168
I'm not gonna beg.
I'm not gonna beg.

11:58.168 --> 12:01.584
Please
Please

12:02.584 --> 12:04.584
Please

12:04.584 --> 12:06.085
Just please tell me, please.

12:06.085 --> 12:07.252
Okay, fine!

12:07.252 --> 12:09.501
You just have to swear
not to tell anyone, okay?

12:09.501 --> 12:11.085
I swear I won't tell anyone.

12:11.085 --> 12:14.043
Everyone, everyone.
I have a very important
announcement to make.

12:14.043 --> 12:16.085
My code was better
than Gilfoyle's.

12:16.085 --> 12:18.085
So it's official.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.584
Gilfoyle is a much worse
coder than me.

12:20.584 --> 12:23.418
I want you all
to look at him.

12:23.418 --> 12:25.085
Good.

12:25.085 --> 12:26.418
Terrible.

12:26.418 --> 12:27.918
Role model.

12:27.918 --> 12:29.252
Hateful pile of trash.

12:29.252 --> 12:30.793
Bullshit.

12:30.793 --> 12:33.626
Says who?
Danny told me.
He wasn't supposed to.

12:33.626 --> 12:35.293
Supposed to be a secret
but he told me

12:35.293 --> 12:37.252
and now everyone's
laughing at you.

12:38.543 --> 12:40.626
Everyone's laugh...
Danny.

12:40.626 --> 12:41.793
What the fuck is going on?

12:41.793 --> 12:44.501
Did his code actually have
less errors than mine?

12:44.501 --> 12:45.751
I don't know
what to tell you.

12:45.751 --> 12:46.918
I checked it three times.

12:46.918 --> 12:48.626
And it's "fewer" errors.

12:48.626 --> 12:49.751
Ooh!

12:49.751 --> 12:51.418
This is the best day
of my life!

12:52.751 --> 12:54.085
Congratulations.

12:59.418 --> 13:00.793
Thank you.

13:00.793 --> 13:03.168
I feel bad for gloating.

13:03.168 --> 13:05.293
In all seriousness,
that means a lot to me.

13:05.293 --> 13:06.501
To show you
I'm a gracious winner,

13:06.501 --> 13:07.751
I'll take you
to a nice restaurant.

13:07.751 --> 13:09.501
Your favorite kind
of restaurant.

13:09.501 --> 13:10.876
A "mis-steak" house!

13:10.876 --> 13:12.960
Boom! Get it?
'Cause you suck.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.335
Yes?

13:33.335 --> 13:34.335
Ni hao.

13:35.335 --> 13:36.543
Do you know who I am?

13:36.543 --> 13:38.377
No.
Okay, okay.

13:38.377 --> 13:39.668
Well, I'm the one
who accidentally

13:39.668 --> 13:41.668
struck one of your employees
with my car earlier

13:41.668 --> 13:44.001
and it's a personal
habit of mine
to make things right.

13:44.001 --> 13:45.335
So...

13:46.626 --> 13:48.168
Do you mind if I come in?

13:50.709 --> 13:53.543
♪ ♪

13:57.043 --> 13:58.210
Okay, what else?

13:58.210 --> 13:59.709
Uh, Colin from
K-Hole Games called,

13:59.709 --> 14:01.543
checking in on the restore.

14:01.543 --> 14:03.210
Put him on
the phone sheet.
Next?

14:03.210 --> 14:05.709
Uh, Laurie Bream said that
she received the compute credits

14:05.709 --> 14:06.876
and to say thank you.

14:08.418 --> 14:09.668
You see?

14:09.668 --> 14:12.709
Business and compassion
are not mutually exclusive.

14:12.709 --> 14:15.252
In fact, sometimes
going out of your way

14:15.252 --> 14:16.709
to help a fellow colleague

14:16.709 --> 14:18.876
can actually put you
further ahead in business.

14:18.876 --> 14:20.876
Let that be a lesson to you,
young Holden.

14:20.876 --> 14:22.168
I'm 30.

14:22.168 --> 14:24.210
And, uh, the CEO of a company
called the Gigglybots called.

14:24.210 --> 14:26.293
He wants to know how to
redeem the compute credits

14:26.293 --> 14:27.584
he just bought
from Laurie Bream.

14:29.001 --> 14:29.960
What?

14:29.960 --> 14:32.210
Ariel was apprehended
this morning

14:32.210 --> 14:36.377
shoplifting machine oil from
an auto parts store in Turlock.

14:36.377 --> 14:39.584
There was, however,
no sign of Fiona.

14:39.584 --> 14:41.335
And with her missing,

14:41.335 --> 14:43.793
I have no need
for compute power

14:43.793 --> 14:46.418
therefore no need
for your compute credits.

14:46.418 --> 14:49.252
Selling them, I think
you'll certainly agree,

14:49.252 --> 14:52.293
was merely a practical
business decision.

14:52.293 --> 14:56.210
Okay, but, I gave you
those credits as a gift.

14:56.210 --> 14:57.584
I was helping you.

14:57.584 --> 14:59.293
You were vomiting, remember?

14:59.293 --> 15:01.459
Ah, yes. Admittedly
a moment of weakness.

15:01.459 --> 15:03.335
However, immediately
after your departure

15:03.335 --> 15:04.751
I consumed two egg whites

15:04.751 --> 15:06.876
and a green bean
and regained my composure.

15:06.876 --> 15:08.793
Laurie, when someone
gives you a gift

15:08.793 --> 15:11.085
and you don't want it,
you give it back.

15:11.085 --> 15:13.252
Okay? You don't
just go sell that gift

15:13.252 --> 15:15.252
to the next fucking
highest bidder--

15:15.252 --> 15:17.168
Richard, mind your tone.

15:17.168 --> 15:19.835
Your lack of emotional
discipline is troubling.

15:19.835 --> 15:22.293
You need to work on this.

15:22.293 --> 15:23.793
Or I may have serious doubts

15:23.793 --> 15:25.626
about granting you
your series B.

15:34.252 --> 15:35.876
Gavin:
A lot of computers in here.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.751
I dabble a bit
in tech myself.

15:39.918 --> 15:41.835
All these people working here.

15:41.835 --> 15:44.127
You must have something
coming to market soon.

15:44.127 --> 15:46.751
No. We have trouble
with the government.

15:46.751 --> 15:47.793
I've heard that.

15:47.793 --> 15:49.543
I mean, to even
operate an online platform

15:49.543 --> 15:51.377
inside the People's
Republic of China

15:51.377 --> 15:54.043
you need a government-issued
ICP license, right?

15:54.043 --> 15:56.459
I left a good life.

15:56.459 --> 15:57.626
Free rent.

15:57.626 --> 15:59.668
Great friends.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.293
To fail in China?

16:02.835 --> 16:04.377
We try to rewrite code,

16:04.377 --> 16:07.252
but government still
won't give us license.

16:07.252 --> 16:08.793
Maybe we'll quit.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.210
Try something else.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.335
Do you like octopus?

16:13.335 --> 16:14.459
Gavin:
I do.

16:14.459 --> 16:16.584
Is that what
you're working on?

16:16.584 --> 16:19.043
That's a decentralized
network, huh?

16:19.043 --> 16:21.335
Wait, what did you do there?

16:21.335 --> 16:24.168
Looks like you removed
the data federation servers.

16:24.168 --> 16:27.668
Yes. And added multicasting
and data projections.

16:27.668 --> 16:29.168
Why? That wouldn't work.

16:29.168 --> 16:31.377
It works. Works fine.

16:32.918 --> 16:35.127
Jian-Yang:
Government still
does not like it.

16:38.709 --> 16:40.127
Best of luck.

16:40.127 --> 16:41.377
Thanks for the tour.

16:43.459 --> 16:46.459
Ah, Gavin.
Dim sum closes in 40 minutes.

16:46.459 --> 16:48.501
Holy shit!
Holy fucking shit!

16:48.501 --> 16:49.709
That brilliant
little idiot.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.085
He found a way
around the patent.

16:51.085 --> 16:52.418
Sir?
It's Hendricks' Internet,

16:52.418 --> 16:53.668
but it's not
Hendricks' Internet.

16:53.668 --> 16:55.043
I want to share
in your excitement, sir,

16:55.043 --> 16:57.210
but I really don't follow.
That guy in there,

16:57.210 --> 16:59.293
he took Hendricks' software
and changed it.

16:59.293 --> 17:00.793
So much so that
it shouldn't work.

17:00.793 --> 17:01.960
But it does.
He showed me the demo.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.085
And here's the thing,
it's different enough

17:04.085 --> 17:06.252
that Hendricks' patent
won't cover it.

17:06.252 --> 17:08.293
Are you sure?
Of course
I'm fucking sure.

17:08.293 --> 17:09.543
I wrote that patent, Hoover!

17:09.543 --> 17:11.584
I've got a hundred
engineers back at Hooli

17:11.584 --> 17:13.168
trying to get around it.
They failed.

17:13.168 --> 17:15.252
But somehow that
monosyllabic moron

17:15.252 --> 17:16.835
just stumbled into it.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.377
I need that kid's code.

17:18.377 --> 17:20.043
I hope that book
you're reading
is for work.

17:20.043 --> 17:21.960
Oh, absolutely...
But if you wanna
read for fun,

17:21.960 --> 17:23.876
you should read
Gilfoyle's favorite author,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.584
George "Error" Martin.

17:25.584 --> 17:27.918
Hear that?
We're all making jokes
at your expense.

17:27.918 --> 17:29.584
Is that what's happening?

17:29.584 --> 17:33.668
As your supervisor,
I wanted to inform you
that there is a first aid kit,

17:33.668 --> 17:35.835
but if you need blood,
don't go to Gilfoyle

17:35.835 --> 17:37.168
'cause he's type-O.

17:37.168 --> 17:39.293
Typo!

17:39.293 --> 17:41.252
They love it.
They're all laughing at you.

17:41.252 --> 17:44.085
Pixar's hit animated
motion picture "Toy Story."

17:44.085 --> 17:46.709
Pixar's hit animated
motion picture
"Toy Story."

17:46.709 --> 17:48.584
Pixar's... oh hey!

17:48.584 --> 17:49.835
Were you guys talking about

17:49.835 --> 17:52.085
Pixar's hit animated
motion picture "Toy Story"?

17:52.085 --> 17:54.252
No.
'Cause Gilfoyle's
favorite character

17:54.252 --> 17:56.085
is "Bugs" Lightyear.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.751
We're all laughing
at you, Gilfoyle.

17:58.751 --> 18:00.793
Monica :
Are you still at Eklow?
Uh, no.

18:00.793 --> 18:02.252
I'm back at the office.

18:02.252 --> 18:04.210
You know, Jared was right.

18:04.210 --> 18:06.835
I showed compassion
to someone who deserves none.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.626
Nothing is personal with Laurie.

18:08.626 --> 18:11.626
Alright? It's what makes her
such a great VC.

18:11.626 --> 18:12.709
And in all candor,

18:12.709 --> 18:14.668
a very challenging
business partner.

18:14.668 --> 18:17.127
I gotta be honest,
it's really nice not
having her in the office.

18:17.127 --> 18:20.876
Yeah, well, now I have to buy
my own compute credits back

18:20.876 --> 18:22.293
with money I don't have...
It's that one.

18:22.293 --> 18:25.085
...which was the whole point
of getting series B.

18:25.085 --> 18:26.459
I'm telling you,
unless you have money

18:26.459 --> 18:27.835
you can't get--
Excuse me.

18:29.918 --> 18:32.127
Richard. Hello.

18:32.127 --> 18:33.626
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

18:33.626 --> 18:34.584
Richard?

18:34.584 --> 18:36.001
What the--
Pied Piper, right?

18:36.001 --> 18:38.127
Uh, yeah.
What is she doing here?

18:38.127 --> 18:40.127
How did she--
Credit card works,

18:40.127 --> 18:41.418
I don't ask questions.

18:42.793 --> 18:44.252
Well this is fucking weird.

18:44.252 --> 18:45.377
I've seen weirder.

18:45.377 --> 18:46.960
Driver:
So should I just...

18:46.960 --> 18:48.960
leave it on the sidewalk
or what?

18:50.127 --> 18:52.168
$50,000 for the whole thing.

18:52.168 --> 18:53.335
All you have to do

18:53.335 --> 18:55.751
is give me your hard drive
with the code base on it.

18:55.751 --> 18:57.793
Oh, and the underlying rights
to the code

18:57.793 --> 18:59.918
in perpetuity
throughout the universe.

18:59.918 --> 19:01.168
Sign there.

19:03.835 --> 19:05.918
No.
Okay.

19:05.918 --> 19:08.501
I like the way you negotiate.

19:08.501 --> 19:09.501
$100,000.

19:09.501 --> 19:11.918
Final offer.
Take it or leave it.

19:17.501 --> 19:20.668
He said, "If oil company
wants to buy your house,

19:20.668 --> 19:23.043
there is oil underneath."

19:23.043 --> 19:24.459
But, I'm not an oil company.

19:24.459 --> 19:27.543
No, you are Gavin Belson.

19:27.543 --> 19:29.085
Oh, so you do know who I am.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.210
I'm smart.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.210
Just name your price.

19:32.210 --> 19:34.210
I'm not going
to sell you my code

19:34.210 --> 19:36.252
until I know why you want it.

19:38.876 --> 19:39.876
Good-bye.

19:43.835 --> 19:45.210
Hello.

19:45.210 --> 19:48.043
Whoa.
This is so cool.

19:49.085 --> 19:50.210
So, uh...

19:50.210 --> 19:51.584
apparently Ariel and I

19:51.584 --> 19:53.876
were the only people
that talked to her

19:53.876 --> 19:55.210
and he's in jail.

19:55.210 --> 19:58.876
So... she came looking
for me at Pied Piper.

19:58.876 --> 20:00.543
And you brought her here?

20:00.543 --> 20:03.293
Can we keep it?
No. No, we cannot.

20:03.293 --> 20:05.377
Richard,
she's stolen property.

20:05.377 --> 20:06.418
And she's worth a fortune.

20:06.418 --> 20:08.418
We-- we have to take her
back to Laurie.

20:08.418 --> 20:11.876
Fiona, what's 12 times 157?

20:11.876 --> 20:15.918
Twelve times 157 is 1,884.

20:15.918 --> 20:17.960
So cool.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.085
Hey, is she right?

20:20.335 --> 20:23.918
Hey Siri,
what's 12 times 157?

20:23.918 --> 20:25.835
Siri:
It's 1,884.

20:25.835 --> 20:27.918
Oh, no way!

20:27.918 --> 20:29.418
Richard--
No, no, no. Look.

20:29.418 --> 20:32.751
You were right.
I was lacking in
emotional discipline.

20:32.751 --> 20:34.418
And I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

20:34.418 --> 20:35.584
From now on,

20:35.584 --> 20:38.584
I'm leaving my emotions
off the fucking table, baby!

20:38.584 --> 20:40.960
Okay, but--
Laurie's gonna
get her robot back.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.001
Tomorrow.

20:42.001 --> 20:44.418
After she gives us
something in return.

20:44.418 --> 20:47.960
A signed series B
term sheet.

20:49.418 --> 20:50.960
Laurie Bream, please.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.252
Oh, you bet your
fucking ass, I'll hold.

20:56.626 --> 20:58.626
Gavin:
I'm not asking you
to cut off his testicles

20:58.626 --> 21:00.085
and shove 'em down his throat,

21:00.085 --> 21:02.293
shoot him in the back
of the head Triad style.

21:02.293 --> 21:04.335
I just need you to get
this kid's code for me.

21:04.335 --> 21:06.293
By whatever means necessary.

21:06.293 --> 21:08.584
That is to say through
extortion or threats.

21:08.584 --> 21:10.793
Well...
Gavin.

21:10.793 --> 21:13.043
As I told you,
this is new China.

21:13.043 --> 21:14.085
Things have changed.

21:14.085 --> 21:15.793
You're telling me you
run a factory this big

21:15.793 --> 21:17.459
and you have
no connections to the Party?

21:17.459 --> 21:19.626
No way to help
this kid see the light?

21:19.626 --> 21:20.960
Come on!

21:20.960 --> 21:23.793
Look, Yao, either you convince
this kid to sell his code to me,

21:23.793 --> 21:25.335
or I'm pulling
my box contract

21:25.335 --> 21:26.835
and I'm taking it
somewhere else.

21:26.835 --> 21:28.001
There are plenty
of other countries

21:28.001 --> 21:30.001
in this part of the world
with cheap labor pools.

21:30.001 --> 21:32.043
There's no new Bangladesh.

21:32.043 --> 21:33.835
There's just Bangladesh.

21:36.876 --> 21:38.668
I'll see what I can do.

21:38.668 --> 21:39.793
Excellent.

21:41.835 --> 21:43.335
Jared, I told Laurie

21:43.335 --> 21:45.668
that we'd get Fiona
back to Eklow around 9:00.

21:45.668 --> 21:46.751
So, when you get here

21:46.751 --> 21:48.293
just pull up to the garage
and we'll...

21:50.293 --> 21:53.043
Oh shit, oh shit,
oh shit, oh shit! She's gone!

21:53.043 --> 21:54.668
She escaped.
How the fuck did she...

21:54.668 --> 21:56.584
What?

21:56.584 --> 21:57.709
Wait, where?

21:57.709 --> 21:59.709
Jared:
It's kind of hard
to explain, but...

21:59.709 --> 22:03.543
a campfire smells sad

22:03.543 --> 22:06.127
and exciting
at the same time.

22:06.127 --> 22:07.835
Fiona:
I understand.

22:07.835 --> 22:09.001
Yeah

22:10.252 --> 22:11.543
Hey.
Hey!

22:11.543 --> 22:12.793
What are you doing out here?

22:12.793 --> 22:14.127
Oh, uh, well...

22:14.127 --> 22:16.543
a few hours
into our conversation,

22:16.543 --> 22:19.085
Fiona mentioned she'd
never seen the ocean.

22:19.085 --> 22:21.043
So I thought about
driving her there

22:21.043 --> 22:22.459
but then I realized
since it was dark

22:22.459 --> 22:24.876
she wouldn't really
appreciate its majesty

22:24.876 --> 22:27.210
so I brought her out here
to the pool.

22:28.501 --> 22:32.501
So you've just been
out here all night,
talking...

22:32.501 --> 22:33.543
to a robot?

22:33.543 --> 22:37.168
Fiona, would you
excuse us
for a second?

22:38.210 --> 22:39.210
Yes.

22:40.751 --> 22:42.210
Come on. Come here.

22:42.210 --> 22:43.543
Okay.

22:43.543 --> 22:47.459
I know that Fiona
is a man-made piece
of digital equipment

22:47.459 --> 22:48.960
Okay.
powered by
artificial intelligence.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.210
Good.
But the level
of that intelligence

22:51.210 --> 22:53.210
is-- it's gobsmacking!

22:53.210 --> 22:56.543
I mean, I don't remember
ever having a conversation

22:56.543 --> 22:58.584
like the one
I've been having with her

22:58.584 --> 22:59.793
over the last 12 hours.

22:59.793 --> 23:01.001
Twelve hours?

23:01.001 --> 23:02.335
We have so much in common.

23:02.335 --> 23:03.751
We discussed our phobias.

23:03.751 --> 23:08.335
I told her that I was afraid
of being found out as a fraud.

23:08.335 --> 23:10.960
And she told me that
she's afraid of magnets.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.751
Look, Richard,
we felt a connection.

23:13.751 --> 23:15.252
It's funny.

23:15.252 --> 23:16.335
The past few weeks,

23:16.335 --> 23:18.668
I've been feeling irritable
and short-tempered

23:18.668 --> 23:20.835
and here I am
on no sleep at all

23:20.835 --> 23:22.043
and I just feel...

23:22.043 --> 23:23.210
woo-hoo-hoo!

23:23.210 --> 23:24.252
You know?

23:24.252 --> 23:25.377
Hey, Jared?

23:25.377 --> 23:26.459
Yes, sir?

23:26.459 --> 23:29.043
You know how
you've been practicing,

23:29.043 --> 23:30.043
your words,

23:30.043 --> 23:32.085
"emotional abstinence"
on me?
Yeah-huh.

23:32.085 --> 23:33.751
Yuh-huh.
Okay.

23:33.751 --> 23:37.001
Well, do you think that
it's maybe at all possible
that because of this,

23:37.001 --> 23:39.918
you've got some
pent-up emotional energy

23:39.918 --> 23:42.459
and last night
you had the chance

23:42.459 --> 23:45.626
to release some of that
pent-up emotional energy

23:45.626 --> 23:48.918
onto the robot?

23:48.918 --> 23:50.793
Her name is Fiona.

23:50.793 --> 23:53.876
Alright, well,
I'm shutting her down

23:53.876 --> 23:55.168
and returning her.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.835
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.918
What if we didn't
give her back?

23:59.918 --> 24:01.543
What if we called Laurie?

24:01.543 --> 24:03.584
We could negotiate
some kind of a deal.

24:03.584 --> 24:06.751
Jared, whatever happened to
emotional discipline, right?

24:06.751 --> 24:08.668
Feelings, and business...

24:08.668 --> 24:10.835
It's over man. Okay?

24:10.835 --> 24:11.960
It's over.

24:17.584 --> 24:19.584
Okay, stop looking
at me, please.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.335
Just look-- look up there.

24:22.626 --> 24:25.543
It's daytime,
but I can see the moon.

24:29.709 --> 24:33.459
♪ ♪

24:33.459 --> 24:35.709
Okay, do you want to--
do you want to ride with us

24:35.709 --> 24:37.210
while we take
her back to Eklow?

24:38.793 --> 24:41.293
Oh yes! Playground games.

24:41.293 --> 24:44.210
Gilfoyle likes to play
"Suck Suck Goose."

24:45.668 --> 24:49.293
Oh! Or it could be
"Duck Duck Goofs."

24:49.293 --> 24:51.168
Danny?

24:51.168 --> 24:53.584
Do those qualify
as two separate insults?

24:53.584 --> 24:56.001
Uh, yeah.
I believe they do.

24:59.418 --> 25:00.668
Why did he gong?

25:00.668 --> 25:03.751
Because I told the engineers
that if you thought you had won,

25:03.751 --> 25:05.418
which you definitely have not,

25:05.418 --> 25:08.501
it would take you less than
24 hours to cobble together

25:08.501 --> 25:11.335
200 uniquely terrible insults.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.626
Which you have just done.

25:13.626 --> 25:16.668
That is why I had Danny
tell you you won.

25:16.668 --> 25:17.876
Is that true, Danny?

25:19.043 --> 25:22.377
Did Gilfoyle really...
beat me?

25:22.377 --> 25:24.085
Private audit. Can't say.

25:24.085 --> 25:25.918
So we don't know
who actually won?

25:25.918 --> 25:28.459
The code contest, no.

25:28.459 --> 25:30.377
But, while you were
running around

25:30.377 --> 25:33.043
racking your tiny brain
for shitty insults,

25:33.043 --> 25:36.252
I was quietly plodding
towards this victory.

25:36.252 --> 25:38.668
You see...

25:38.668 --> 25:41.252
it is I who am the tortoise.

25:41.252 --> 25:44.043
And you are the hairy Arab

25:44.043 --> 25:46.709
who can now
chortle my balls.

25:50.709 --> 25:51.918
What's happening?

25:51.918 --> 25:53.501
Why did you do that?

25:53.501 --> 25:55.668
Right after you forced me
to set Dinesh up,

25:55.668 --> 25:58.085
I told the other engineers
that if you won

25:58.085 --> 25:59.751
you'd immediately insult Dinesh

25:59.751 --> 26:02.085
by saying something
sexually demeaning or racist.

26:02.085 --> 26:03.918
And you just did both.

26:03.918 --> 26:05.418
I see.

26:05.418 --> 26:07.043
Fun at my expense.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.584
Now if it's alright with
upper management,

26:08.584 --> 26:10.335
we have a shit ton
of work to do.

26:10.335 --> 26:12.793
Yeah,
like so frickin' much.

26:17.377 --> 26:18.626
Assholes.

26:19.876 --> 26:20.918
I wanna fire Danny.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.210
Do it.

26:24.127 --> 26:25.252
I'll ask Richard.

26:27.335 --> 26:28.960
We are at Eklow Labs.

26:30.001 --> 26:31.876
Yes, we are.

26:31.876 --> 26:33.626
The site of my creation.

26:36.626 --> 26:37.793
Richard?

26:37.793 --> 26:40.793
Do you think if I asked,
they would let me visit her?

26:40.793 --> 26:42.335
Jared, she's gonna be okay.

26:42.335 --> 26:45.501
Alright? She's gonna be plugged
back into her old servers,

26:45.501 --> 26:47.459
surrounded
by familiar engineers,

26:47.459 --> 26:49.626
sitting on the table
where she was born.

26:49.626 --> 26:53.626
I promise.
She's going to be fine.

26:57.751 --> 26:59.960
Extreme care with
the optical sensors,
gentlemen.

27:01.168 --> 27:03.709
Boston Dynamics
needs them overnighted.

27:03.709 --> 27:04.835
Richard:
I don't understand.

27:04.835 --> 27:07.335
Fiona is this company's
most valuable asset.

27:07.335 --> 27:10.043
Yes, and as such she will
garner the highest return

27:10.043 --> 27:13.127
when I have her dismantled
and sold off for parts.

27:16.543 --> 27:20.168
So you're just gonna
take all this promising tech

27:20.168 --> 27:21.335
and liquidate it?

27:21.335 --> 27:23.168
Yes. As quickly as I'm able.

27:23.168 --> 27:24.252
Dude, check it out.

27:24.252 --> 27:26.168
I'm a robot.

27:26.168 --> 27:30.085
Richard, being a CEO
is a terrible waste of time.

27:30.085 --> 27:32.043
And a horrible way
to make a living.

27:32.043 --> 27:34.127
I'll be returning to
Bream-Hall immediately.

27:35.459 --> 27:38.501
Speaking of... as promised.

27:38.501 --> 27:40.960
A term sheet
for your series B.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.668
Congratulations, Richard.

27:42.668 --> 27:43.960
Thank you.

27:45.626 --> 27:47.543
See? Silver lining.

27:47.543 --> 27:49.501
I told you--

27:49.501 --> 27:51.377
Wait, uh.
Hey, Jared...

27:51.377 --> 27:53.459
Don't-- Don't go over there.
Don't look in that.

27:53.459 --> 27:55.252
Jared:
Oh, Fiona...

27:55.252 --> 27:57.335
Come on, let's...

27:57.335 --> 27:59.543
Let's get out of here, huh?

27:59.543 --> 28:00.835
What do you say
we go to the office

28:00.835 --> 28:02.168
and you can make
me some tea?

28:02.168 --> 28:03.584
That might
make you feel better?

28:14.043 --> 28:15.459
So, did he sign?

28:15.459 --> 28:16.835
It's done.

28:16.835 --> 28:18.459
Fuck yes!

28:18.459 --> 28:19.543
How'd you get him to do it?

28:19.543 --> 28:21.459
I made it clear
it would be better for him

28:21.459 --> 28:24.210
to hand over the company
and leave town immediately.

28:24.210 --> 28:26.335
That's some old
Chinese shit right there.

28:26.335 --> 28:28.043
I told you,
you're a badass, Yao.

28:29.626 --> 28:31.918
Wait, this lists you
as the buyer, not me.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.418
So, what's the plan here?
You're gonna sign it
over to me then?

28:34.418 --> 28:38.918
Gavin, I'm afraid
I will no longer be able
to manufacture your boxes.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.335
You see, my company
will be too busy

28:41.335 --> 28:43.127
manufacturing a new device,

28:43.127 --> 28:47.043
built on a radically
better technology
that I now own

28:47.043 --> 28:49.793
that will quickly
render yours obsolete.

28:49.793 --> 28:51.543
Here in China, and,

28:51.543 --> 28:54.252
according to the U.S.
patent office,

28:54.252 --> 28:56.085
in America as well.

28:57.252 --> 28:59.418
Oh, the children
have returned to sing for you.
