00:08.309 --> 00:10.777
Hey, Sack-Happy,                
how you doing?                  

00:10.812 --> 00:12.979
                  Hey, there,   
                  Rubber Thumbs.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.214
Hey, I thought                  
you'd be                        

00:14.248 --> 00:15.248
          on a dim route by now.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.482
I don't see you pushing         

00:16.517 --> 00:18.484
many number one sacks           
there, Clavin.                  

00:18.519 --> 00:20.153
         What the heck          
    are they talking about?     

00:20.187 --> 00:22.055
It's kind of a postal rap.      

00:23.591 --> 00:26.660
             Hey, there's a flap
             that you had a     
             brush with utility.

00:26.695 --> 00:27.928
Ah, 604 is all the way.         

00:27.962 --> 00:29.897
            Yeah, well, you     
            know the scheme fin.

00:29.931 --> 00:31.364
    Yeah.                       

00:31.399 --> 00:33.433
    You know, I actually once   
    thought of asking Cliff     

00:33.468 --> 00:35.502
          what it all meant, but
          then it occurred to me

00:35.536 --> 00:36.737
            he might tell me.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.681
Well, I, I can't put this off   
another minute.                 

01:54.715 --> 01:55.599
      What's up, Frasier?       

01:55.633 --> 01:57.184
I'm a man in a predicament, Sam.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.584
    I've got to find a gift     

01:58.619 --> 02:01.021
for the dearest, sweetest,      
 most wonderful woman on Earth. 

02:01.055 --> 02:03.040
             So, you finally    
             dumped Lilith, huh?

02:03.074 --> 02:04.374
    No.                         

02:04.408 --> 02:05.842
It's our one-month anniversary, 

02:05.877 --> 02:08.044
      and I'm just stumped      
     about what to get her.     

02:08.078 --> 02:09.579
        Any suggestions?        

02:09.614 --> 02:12.098
    Well, you could get her     
         a nice "mank."         

02:12.132 --> 02:13.584
        "Mank"?                 

02:13.618 --> 02:15.969
        Yeah. You know,         
    it's a mock mink.           

02:16.004 --> 02:18.521
             I got one for Vera.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.240
    You cannot tell it          
      from the real thing.      

02:20.275 --> 02:21.475
          It's great.           

02:21.509 --> 02:22.776
  Unless, of course, it rains,  

02:22.810 --> 02:24.444
        and then you just       
        toss it in the dryer,   

02:24.479 --> 02:26.930
    and you leave the house     
      for a couple hours.       

02:28.249 --> 02:30.067
        Well, I suppose         
    I'll think of something.    

02:30.101 --> 02:31.334
         Wish me luck.          

02:31.368 --> 02:33.954
        Hey, Cliff, new suit?   

02:33.988 --> 02:35.288
    Oh, well, no, actually,     

02:35.323 --> 02:37.891
I just had it dry cleaned       
          there, Doc.           

02:37.925 --> 02:39.092
        Uh, hey, Woody.         

02:39.126 --> 02:42.145
a beer, and uh, one for         
 <i>mi compadre</i> here, Normie.      

02:45.283 --> 02:46.483
              Are you all right?

02:46.517 --> 02:47.985
     Yeah, no, it's just...     

02:48.019 --> 02:51.404
      Sorry. I thought Cliff was
      going to buy me a beer.   

02:55.877 --> 02:58.211
Well, uh, well, I am.           

03:00.381 --> 03:02.349
        Hey, hey, Norm,         
    Norm, no, come on, now,     

03:02.383 --> 03:03.816
knock it off there,             
will you?                       

03:03.851 --> 03:06.619
Geez. It's just that my annual  
civil service raise             

03:06.653 --> 03:09.622
came in today, you know,        
at three and a half percent,    

03:09.656 --> 03:12.458
just like clockwork,            
you know, as if, uh,            

03:12.493 --> 03:15.128
carrying that bag               
wasn't honor enough.            

03:15.162 --> 03:17.580
Wow, Mr. Clavin,                
you got a raise, huh?           
        Yup.                    

03:17.615 --> 03:19.265
        I've been hoping        
 for a raise for two years now. 

03:19.300 --> 03:20.433
    I haven't gotten diddly.    

03:20.467 --> 03:22.369
Well, Woody,                    
that is an outrage.             

03:22.403 --> 03:23.836
You ought to walk               
right up to Miss Howe,          

03:23.871 --> 03:26.606
look her square in the eye,     
and demand diddly.              

03:26.640 --> 03:27.874
                    ( <i>laughing</i> )

03:27.908 --> 03:29.842
    Ah, tell you what,          
    you work overtime,          

03:29.877 --> 03:31.577
you get over-diddly, pal.       

03:31.612 --> 03:32.762
                    ( <i>laughing</i> )

03:32.797 --> 03:34.864
And, uh, diddly-                
and-a-half on weekends,         

03:34.899 --> 03:37.834
( <i>laughing</i> ):                   
and, uh, golden diddly          
on holidays, too.               

03:37.868 --> 03:39.068
             Uh, Cliff, Cliff...

03:39.103 --> 03:41.288
        The secret              
    is knowing when to stop.    

03:42.606 --> 03:43.757
        Hey, uh, Sam?           
    Yeah?                       

03:43.791 --> 03:44.825
          Do you think Miss Howe

03:44.859 --> 03:46.860
        would give me a raise   
        if I asked her?         

03:46.894 --> 03:49.496
Well, let's see, uh,            
you're a good bartender,        

03:49.530 --> 03:52.315
you've never had a vacation,    
you never been out sick.        

03:52.349 --> 03:54.250
    Probably not.               

03:54.284 --> 03:56.970
        Aw, gee, really, Sam?   
Oh, she's tough.                

03:57.004 --> 03:58.838
Maybe if you get her            
in a good mood.                 

03:58.873 --> 03:59.956
        Uh, how do I do that?   

03:59.990 --> 04:01.541
Well, put her in a good mood,   
you know?                       

04:01.575 --> 04:03.076
Be nice to her;                 
compliment her.                 

04:03.110 --> 04:05.378
            Compliment-- right. 
    Yeah.                       

04:05.413 --> 04:06.696
        Okay, thanks, Sam.      
Mm-hmm.                         

04:06.731 --> 04:07.998
          I'll do it.           

04:08.032 --> 04:10.333
 Uh, what should I compliment?  

04:10.367 --> 04:12.135
         I don't know;          
  first thing you see, Woody.   

04:13.471 --> 04:14.804
                        REBECCA:
                        Come in.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.940
Miss Howe,                      
did I ever tell you             

04:16.974 --> 04:19.659
you have a nice...?             

04:21.928 --> 04:23.330
        uh, smile?              

04:24.765 --> 04:26.199
            Thank you, Woody.   

04:26.233 --> 04:27.517
          ( <i>softly</i> ):           
             Yeah.              

04:27.552 --> 04:29.052
Was there something you wanted? 

04:29.086 --> 04:30.720
Well, uh, Miss Howe,            

04:30.755 --> 04:34.591
I've been here at Cheers        
for quite a while now.          

04:34.625 --> 04:36.259
I'm a good worker,              

04:36.293 --> 04:38.211
    I don't take vacations,     
        I'm never sick,         

04:38.246 --> 04:40.013
 and I was just wondering if... 

04:40.047 --> 04:42.381
  No, Woody, Woody, I'm going   
to have to stop you right there.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.117
I cannot give you a title.      

04:44.151 --> 04:45.385
            "Title"?            

04:45.419 --> 04:47.370
  Yes, I know you deserve it,   
      but the front office      

04:47.405 --> 04:49.305
      just doesn't let me       
     hand those things out.     

04:49.340 --> 04:51.157
         No, Miss Howe,         
     you don't understand.      

04:51.192 --> 04:53.260
You know, sometimes people      
    work here ten, 15 years     

04:53.294 --> 04:54.360
before receiving a title.       

04:54.395 --> 04:55.495
     How can I justify...?      

04:55.529 --> 04:57.297
Miss Howe, I want a raise.      

04:57.331 --> 04:59.065
        Oh, is that all?        

04:59.099 --> 05:00.017
                    That's fine.

05:00.134 --> 05:03.136
        How much do you want?   

05:03.170 --> 05:04.337
Just like that?                 
                Well, of course.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.339
      I thought you came in here
      to beat me out of a title,

05:06.373 --> 05:07.340
            but if you just want

05:07.374 --> 05:09.308
      to settle for money,      
    well, that's fine.          

05:09.343 --> 05:10.560
         Wait a minute.         

05:10.595 --> 05:12.362
        Let's just stick        
     with this title thing.     

05:12.396 --> 05:15.399
    No, no, Woody, you said     
 you would settle for a raise.  

05:15.433 --> 05:17.501
         Now, I'm going         
    to hold you to it.          

05:17.535 --> 05:19.785
    Oh, no, I blew it!          

05:21.622 --> 05:24.107
     I should have demanded     
            a title.            

05:24.141 --> 05:27.844
    Money gets spent,           
    but titles are forever.     

05:27.878 --> 05:29.062
    No, Woody, I told you...    

05:29.096 --> 05:30.313
     Doggone it, Miss Howe,     

05:30.347 --> 05:33.399
you're not going                
to palm some raise off on me.   

05:33.433 --> 05:34.734
      I don't want money.       

05:34.768 --> 05:36.236
      I-I deserve a title.      

05:36.270 --> 05:40.807
Woody, I've met some tough      
negotiators in my life...       

05:42.159 --> 05:43.493
All right, you deserve it.      

05:43.527 --> 05:45.095
  I'll go to the mat for you.   

05:45.129 --> 05:46.362
                Congratulations.

05:46.396 --> 05:49.232
            You're the new      
            Senior Bartender.   

05:49.266 --> 05:52.569
Get out! Senior Bartender?!     

05:52.603 --> 05:54.854
Wait till I tell my folks!      

05:54.888 --> 05:56.055
To think I came in here         

05:56.090 --> 05:57.891
asking for                      
a stupid little raise,          

05:57.925 --> 05:59.158
and now this.                   

05:59.193 --> 06:00.860
          I just hope           
it doesn't go to my head.       

06:00.895 --> 06:03.696
    Oh... that's what's nice    
    about you, Woody.           

06:03.731 --> 06:06.132
Nothing ever goes to your head. 

06:10.788 --> 06:12.105
              Hey.              

06:12.139 --> 06:14.924
So, did you get                 
the raise?                      

06:14.959 --> 06:18.862
      Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,      
         Sammy, Sammy.          

06:18.896 --> 06:21.297
                There's more to 
                life than money.

06:21.331 --> 06:23.166
Oh, no,                         
you didn't get the raise.       

06:23.201 --> 06:24.835
                 I got something
                 much better.   

06:24.869 --> 06:28.004
    You're looking at Cheers'   
    new Senior Bartender.       

06:28.039 --> 06:30.123
Oh, Woody, you didn't fall      
for that, did you?              

06:30.157 --> 06:31.141
                  Fall for what?

06:31.259 --> 06:32.459
Oh, man, she conned you.        

06:32.493 --> 06:34.294
She talked you                  
into accepting a title          

06:34.328 --> 06:35.295
instead of a raise.             

06:35.329 --> 06:36.329
I don't believe you.            

06:36.364 --> 06:38.030
              Hey, I'd like to  
              see you do better.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.031
         ( <i>chuckling</i> ):         
             Hey...             

06:39.066 --> 06:40.550
she may be able                 
to pull the wool                

06:40.584 --> 06:41.951
over your eyes,                 
but not mine.                   

06:41.986 --> 06:42.952
As a matter of fact,            

06:42.987 --> 06:44.237
I'll prove it to you.           

06:44.271 --> 06:46.739
You know, I'm due for a raise   
around here.                    

06:46.773 --> 06:48.141
    Behold the master here.     

06:48.175 --> 06:49.476
     Woody, watch the bar.      

06:49.510 --> 06:50.777
Sam.                            
        Mm-hmm.                 

06:50.811 --> 06:52.195
Considering my new title,       

06:52.230 --> 06:54.197
I don't think you can just      
give me orders like that.       

06:54.232 --> 06:55.282
         You're right.          

06:55.316 --> 06:57.117
    Please forgive me.          

06:57.151 --> 06:59.953
    Um, I respectfully          
    request permission          

06:59.987 --> 07:04.291
        to ask you              
     to watch the bar, sir.     

07:04.325 --> 07:06.626
Money can't buy                 
that kind of respect.           

07:09.429 --> 07:10.180
I was wondering...              

07:10.298 --> 07:12.064
            The answer is no.   

07:12.099 --> 07:14.801
  Oh, come on, a little raise   
is not going to kill you.       

07:14.835 --> 07:16.068
    No, a little raise          

07:16.103 --> 07:17.304
                    is not going
                    to kill me. 

07:17.338 --> 07:19.239
            And neither are     
            those little free   
            rounds of drinks    

07:19.273 --> 07:20.373
                we're always    
                giving everyone.

07:20.408 --> 07:21.441
          Or the little bar tabs

07:21.476 --> 07:23.376
             all our friends are
             always running up. 

07:23.411 --> 07:26.196
 But you add them all together, 
and they spell bankruptcy.      

07:26.230 --> 07:28.231
    Which is probably           
     more than you can do.      

07:28.266 --> 07:29.499
Wait a minute.                  

07:29.533 --> 07:32.168
What do you mean                
"bankruptcy"?                   

07:32.203 --> 07:34.170
    We're losing money, Sam.    

07:34.205 --> 07:35.522
          And as long as we are,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.624
no one's getting a raise.       
            Nothing.            

07:37.658 --> 07:39.925
     All right, all right.      

07:39.960 --> 07:41.211
But if you want to go out there 

07:41.245 --> 07:42.879
         and save face          
in front of your friends,       

07:42.913 --> 07:46.632
     I can give you a title     
     just like I did Woody.     

07:46.667 --> 07:47.684
         Oh... come on.         

07:47.718 --> 07:50.754
    A-a title to save face?     

07:50.788 --> 07:52.822
How childish do you think I am? 

07:54.508 --> 07:55.859
          Senior Bartender, huh?

07:55.893 --> 07:58.528
            Well, Wood, you     
            know, I'd say a, uh,

07:58.562 --> 07:59.729
little promotion like that      

07:59.764 --> 08:02.365
    kind of deserves a round    
    of drinks on the house.     

08:02.399 --> 08:04.333
     Aw, gee, Mr. Peterson,     
          I'd love to,          

08:04.368 --> 08:08.237
and I-I'm real sorry, but gosh, 
I-I just don't think I'd better.

08:08.272 --> 08:11.040
  Boy, you give a guy a title,  
    he turns into a fascist.    

08:12.910 --> 08:15.328
So, Wood, now that you scratched
      and clawed your way       

08:15.362 --> 08:16.763
 to the top of your profession, 

08:16.797 --> 08:18.748
      are you still going       
  to talk to us little people?  

08:18.783 --> 08:20.533
"Little people"?                

08:20.567 --> 08:22.886
         Oh, right, uh,         
      you folks don't like      

08:22.920 --> 08:25.021
 to be called midgets anymore.  

08:27.374 --> 08:29.108
    Sure, I'll talk to you.     

08:29.142 --> 08:32.895
     It won't be easy with      
 your tongue in another state.  

08:36.299 --> 08:38.067
 So, Sam, how much did you get? 

08:38.102 --> 08:40.135
Well, it's kind of complicated, 
             Woody.             

08:40.169 --> 08:42.938
 It's all tied up with bonuses  
    and stock options.          

08:42.974 --> 08:44.273
                    But I can   

08:44.308 --> 08:46.776
         tell you that,         
     uh, you're looking at      

08:46.811 --> 08:49.913
    the new Executive           
     Supervising Bartender.     

08:49.947 --> 08:52.582
          NORM:                 
          Well, congratulations,
          Sammy.                

08:52.616 --> 08:54.918
             You know, I'd say a
             promotion like that

08:54.952 --> 08:55.835
        kind of deserves a round
        of drinks on the house. 

08:55.953 --> 08:58.154
Nice try, man.                  
                Well, you know. 

08:58.188 --> 08:59.989
You just couldn't stand it, Sam,
        could you?              

09:00.024 --> 09:01.590
    That I had a title          
        and you didn't.         

09:01.625 --> 09:02.892
    Oh, come on, Woody.         

09:02.927 --> 09:05.394
    These titles                
    don't mean anything.        

09:05.429 --> 09:07.313
      You want to switch?       

09:07.348 --> 09:08.180
    Right. Senior Bartender.    

09:08.215 --> 09:10.433
    Like I've been dying        
    for that one all my life.   

09:12.069 --> 09:13.819
Hey, at least mine's            
a real great title              

09:13.854 --> 09:15.755
and not a stupid                
made-up one like yours.         

09:15.789 --> 09:16.889
    Hey, mine is not made up.   

09:16.924 --> 09:17.890
     Hey, hey, all right,       
     all right, all right,      

09:17.925 --> 09:19.192
knock it off, all right?!       

09:19.226 --> 09:20.893
Will the Senior Idiot Bartender 

09:20.928 --> 09:23.296
    and the Executive           
    Supervising Moron           

09:23.330 --> 09:25.631
        shut their yaps         
     for about ten seconds?     

09:25.666 --> 09:26.933
    You're bartenders.          

09:26.967 --> 09:28.634
        That's it.              

09:28.669 --> 09:31.304
    You're a bartender          
and you're a bartender, period. 

09:31.338 --> 09:33.123
                  ( <i>door shuts</i> )

09:33.157 --> 09:34.457
                  Carla's right.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.792
                I'm sorry.      

09:35.827 --> 09:37.527
Yeah, me, too.                  

09:37.561 --> 09:39.162
         I, however, am         

09:39.197 --> 09:42.832
     the Managing Director      
         of Waitresses.         

09:42.866 --> 09:45.068
NORM:                           
Well, uh,                       

09:45.102 --> 09:46.519
congratulations, Carla.         

09:46.554 --> 09:49.155
You know, I'd say...            
            Give it up, Norm.   

09:49.189 --> 09:51.541
    That does it.               
                What?           

09:54.912 --> 09:58.348
Miss Howe, I heard about Carla  
and Sam's new titles,           

09:58.382 --> 10:00.617
and I must say                  
I've got a problem.             

10:00.651 --> 10:02.051
        You've got a problem?   

10:02.086 --> 10:03.986
                 I'll tell you  
                 about problems.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.489
             I will tell you    
             all about problems.

10:06.524 --> 10:08.725
      We've been losing money   
      for the last three months.

10:08.759 --> 10:09.959
    I have just been informed   

10:09.994 --> 10:11.594
             that if we continue
             to lose money,     

10:11.628 --> 10:13.696
            the bar is going to 
            be put on the block,

10:13.730 --> 10:15.031
              and then my career
              will be over,     

10:15.065 --> 10:18.101
          and so will everyone's
          drinking days         
          here at Cheers.       

10:18.135 --> 10:19.802
                Understood?     

10:24.742 --> 10:26.610
                  ( <i>door shuts</i> )

10:30.114 --> 10:31.514
                    Well...     

10:31.548 --> 10:34.817
             maybe it isn't     
             exactly my place   
             to say this, but...

10:34.852 --> 10:36.602
              Cheers means about
              as much to me     

10:36.636 --> 10:38.204
                as it does to   
                anyone here.    

10:38.238 --> 10:39.422
                    This is, uh,

10:39.456 --> 10:40.440
                pretty bad news.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.475
                  I'd say bad   
                  news like this

10:42.510 --> 10:45.478
             deserves a sympathy
             round of drinks    

10:45.513 --> 10:46.696
                on the house.   

10:47.481 --> 10:49.382
                What? Oh, what?!

10:56.206 --> 10:56.957
     You really don't think     

10:56.991 --> 10:58.240
we're gonna lose the bar,       
            do you?             

10:58.275 --> 11:00.009
I don't know.                   
            I mean,             
     what are we gonna do?      

11:00.044 --> 11:02.212
                    Where are   
                    we gonna go?

11:02.246 --> 11:04.947
                Home?           

11:04.981 --> 11:06.433
All right, listen,              
listen, listen.                 

11:06.467 --> 11:09.068
We-We got to think of some way  
to drum up business.            

11:09.102 --> 11:11.655
Well, what do you want us to do,
force people to drink here?     

11:11.689 --> 11:13.222
Pour beers down their throats?  

11:13.257 --> 11:13.973
                No, Carla.      

11:14.008 --> 11:15.825
                  Well, don't   
                  be hasty, Sam.

11:15.859 --> 11:17.526
                  Let her talk. 
SAM:                            
Norm,                           

11:17.561 --> 11:18.728
you-you work for the big firms. 

11:18.762 --> 11:20.830
        What do they do         
 when they need a lot of money? 

11:20.864 --> 11:22.182
 All right, first off, they...  

11:22.216 --> 11:24.684

    all the dead wood.          

11:24.718 --> 11:25.501
        Yeah, then what?        

11:25.535 --> 11:27.603
  I'm long gone by then, Sam.   

11:30.324 --> 11:32.358
Well, what if we got something  
real valuable                   

11:32.393 --> 11:33.426
that everybody wanted,          

11:33.460 --> 11:35.194
and then gave away chances      
to win it?                      

11:35.228 --> 11:37.196
                A raffle?       

11:37.230 --> 11:39.832
Sam, would you mind giving      
my idea a little consideration  

11:39.866 --> 11:42.067
before you just jump in         
with yours?                     

11:42.102 --> 11:44.020
                No, no, no...   

11:44.055 --> 11:45.588
            R-Rebecca, hey,     
            I think we, uh...   

11:45.622 --> 11:46.856
                We put our heads
                together here   

11:46.890 --> 11:48.724
                and came up with
                a solution to   
                your problem.   

11:48.759 --> 11:50.126
Sam, please.                    
This is my problem.             

11:50.161 --> 11:52.095
I'll handle it by myself.       
                No, hey, listen.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.850
All right, Sam,                 
what's your great idea?         

11:57.885 --> 11:59.451
Well, I-I think                 
you're gonna like it.           

11:59.486 --> 12:00.687
It's-it's, uh, real special.    

12:00.721 --> 12:02.488
I-I think                       
you'll be pleasantly surprised. 

12:02.522 --> 12:03.790
It's, uh...                     

12:03.824 --> 12:06.059
well, we hold a raffle.

                Oh, please.     

12:07.361 --> 12:10.062
Well, actually,                 
it was, uh, Woody's idea.       

12:10.097 --> 12:12.681
      We could give away        
      a Caribbean cruise.       

12:12.716 --> 12:14.934
        Hey, Woodchuck,         
        not a bad idea.         

12:14.969 --> 12:17.720
  You think she just handed me  
          this title?           

12:17.754 --> 12:19.706
SAM:                            
Listen, it'd be perfect.        

12:19.740 --> 12:21.307
I mean, people would be pouring 
in here.                        

12:21.341 --> 12:22.676
We'll be out of the red         
in no time.                     

12:22.710 --> 12:24.010
Come on, let's give it a shot.  

12:24.045 --> 12:25.078
                All right.      

12:25.112 --> 12:26.379
Why not?                        

12:26.413 --> 12:27.647
              It's a mark of how
              desperate I am    

12:27.681 --> 12:29.248
        that I'm willing        
    to take any half-baked,     

12:29.282 --> 12:32.652
      hair-brained scheme       
from a bunch of bozos like this.

12:32.686 --> 12:33.970
         All we ask for         
    is a little faith.

        I have found it.

Sam, anything                   

12:39.493 --> 12:42.829

one gets having discovered      

12:42.863 --> 12:44.964
 and then purchased a fine work 
            of art?             

12:44.999 --> 12:48.017
     Yeah, sticking your foot in
     a pan of scalding hot water

12:48.052 --> 12:49.752
                  when you got  
                  a fungus itch.

12:50.754 --> 12:51.938
  Well, you may not know art,   

12:51.972 --> 12:53.206
  but you know what you like.   

12:53.240 --> 12:54.941
So, uh, correct me              
if I'm wrong there, Doc,        

12:54.975 --> 12:56.109
but that's from the, uh,

isn't it?

    to Lilith is an abstract

     like that might cost?

          a painting?

    she might actually want?

 Oh, no, Lilith will love this.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.468
It's an original Tidwell.       

13:22.503 --> 13:24.704
    See, it represents          
         man's struggle         

13:24.738 --> 13:26.506
against intransigent fate.

No. Here, here.                 

13:29.827 --> 13:32.478

for a moment.

        we got a live one.

if I keep this

14:03.060 --> 14:05.228

those Ping-Pong balls yet?

 happy faces on all the zeros.

            believe this.

            This place has      
            been packed for     
            two weeks now.      

14:30.037 --> 14:31.871
This contest was a great idea.

I kind of like                  

14:33.306 --> 14:34.723
              the way it used   
              to be around here.

14:34.758 --> 14:36.458
Yeah, know                      
what you mean, Normy.

             treating us like   
             some kind of public
             gathering place.   

14:42.266 --> 14:45.084
I think this little raffle idea 
of mine turned out pretty well, 

14:45.118 --> 14:46.452
don't you?                      

14:46.486 --> 14:49.421
Don't you think you ought       
to give me a little thank you?  

14:49.456 --> 14:50.656
A little pat on the back?       

14:50.690 --> 14:52.691
Or you on your back?            

14:53.927 --> 14:55.561
        Oh, Sam, when you       
        say things like that,   

14:55.595 --> 14:56.896
                you make me love
                you even more.  

14:56.930 --> 14:59.065
You're being sarcastic, right?  

14:59.933 --> 15:02.251
            Are you?            

15:03.353 --> 15:04.920
         Oh, Dr. Crane,         
     I'm glad you're here.      

15:04.955 --> 15:07.073
            I hate to mention   
            this, but you've    
            had that picture    

15:07.107 --> 15:09.575
              of the two dogs   
              in my office for  
              quite a while now.

15:09.609 --> 15:10.976
             When are you giving
             that to Lilith?    

15:11.011 --> 15:12.445
I'm going to give it            
to her tonight.                 

15:12.479 --> 15:13.846

15:13.880 --> 15:15.949
they are not-- and I can't      
  say this more emphatically--  

15:15.983 --> 15:16.983
        two dogs.               

15:17.017 --> 15:18.718
Whatever. I want them out       

15:18.752 --> 15:19.886

15:19.920 --> 15:21.054

                    reminding me

15:21.088 --> 15:22.355
                 of how lousy my
                 social life is.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.875

honest with ya,

Well, the Clavin men, uh,       
all go down to the sea.

in my veins.

not a proponent of surprises.

to close my eyes,

                your eyes open.

What's important to me is that  
I have two satisfied customers,

that both of you get that trip.

All right.

    mean the end of my job.

  to have any bearing on this.

      to be really happy.       

20:51.668 --> 20:53.302
                And maybe you   
                could send me   

20:53.337 --> 20:55.537
        a postcard
