WEBVTT

00:11.136 --> 00:13.680
"We all worship false idols."

00:13.764 --> 00:16.600
That's what my friend, Joshua Keith,
once told me.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.145
He recognized the power of worship.

00:20.229 --> 00:25.442
That unfettered belief
was the holiest form of any ritual.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.906
For Joshua,
the truth was his chosen deity.

00:33.242 --> 00:39.581
But the true believer, the blind follower,
was a creature he could not understand.

00:39.665 --> 00:43.418
The subject of Josh's documentary,
the Sons of Ivar,

00:43.502 --> 00:45.295
claimed him as their own.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.090
But rather than a supposed
men's rights group,

00:48.173 --> 00:51.802
Josh saw only a sea of violent men.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.387
So he disavowed them.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.056
Shunning their leaders, their philosophy,

00:56.139 --> 01:00.853
and any attempts they made
to claim him or his art as their own.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.939
And because of that, he made enemies.

01:07.734 --> 01:13.031
The abrupt closing of Joshua's case
is just too easy.

01:14.366 --> 01:16.702
Too many questions left unanswered.

01:17.536 --> 01:22.165
Questions the San Francisco
Police Department refused to solve.

01:32.259 --> 01:35.220
We will present the known facts.

01:35.888 --> 01:39.433
The information ignored by the media
and the police.

01:41.143 --> 01:47.357
Join me on this season
of Reconsidered: Joshua Keith.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.305
I see the horn of Drengir beckoned you in.

03:01.765 --> 03:05.185
There's easier ways to ingratiate yourself
into our esteem.

03:06.436 --> 03:10.816
Our group is lousy
with disgruntled, alienated cops.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.693
What's one more?

03:12.776 --> 03:13.944
We're alone.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.198
Off.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.741
No, no. Needs to look official.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.451
Don't wanna blow your cover.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.745
Yeah. I wouldn't mind if you did.

03:24.329 --> 03:28.375
Had about all I can take
of this beta male victimhood.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.462
So you find anything on the Keith murder?

03:33.088 --> 03:34.631
Sons of Ivar involved?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.886
Double murder's beyond them.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.181
The guys I know can hardly read
a QAnon post without blushing.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.934
Well, being a pussy
is not a recognized defense.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.188
But an alibi is.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.858
The entire top brass was overseeing
a new member initiation.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.278
Live cameras, witnesses,
whatever you're gonna need.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.157
I thought the case was closed already.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.243
Yeah, that's the official stance
of the department.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.246
So, shouldn't you be back on Intelligence?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.832
Well, Parnell's keeping the story
in the news.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.293
Maybe she's got a point.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.963
So what does Sarge think about this?

04:15.047 --> 04:17.757
No, he doesn't want
any leaks or distractions.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.551
Not after what happened to Owen Cave.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.348
-Well, it's good he trusts you then.
-Yeah.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.434
That or he needs
a fall guy nobody's gonna miss.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.189
Yeah.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.732
Sing it.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.053
That was wonderful.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.307
Just... wonderful.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.516
Thank you, Daddy.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.934
Yeah, it was nice to sing again.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.063
I'll tell you what I didn't like.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.232
You heard that new priest?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.860
"Redeemer, Sustainer, Creator."

05:59.943 --> 06:02.154
What happened to
"Father, Son, Holy Spirit"?

06:02.237 --> 06:04.239
The new words include everybody, Daddy.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.909
You will never convince him,
so don't even try.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.954
He's still got us wearing veils, and
those were stopped before I was born.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.540
Hey, don't remind me
how young you are, Elinor.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.382
Well, I've been called a lot of things
but never that.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.259
What?

06:26.011 --> 06:27.721
You called me Elinor.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.816
Girls, come sit down.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.115
Poppy, you come sit next to me.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.328
I got something to say.

06:56.875 --> 07:00.212
When my mama and daddy died,
the family just didn't leave Louisiana.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.797
We left each other.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.467
I want y'all to stay together.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.053
What's going on?

07:08.136 --> 07:09.346
Shreve.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.853
You know
I've been having some difficulties.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.981
It seems it might be something
more serious.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.069
Poppy got me into a medical study
in the city.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.950
And you didn't wanna tell me first?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.410
What kind of problems, Daddy?

07:32.619 --> 07:34.037
I didn't want you to know.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.998
Not Poppy, not any of you.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.210
But you're my family,
and that's what family's for.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.466
Now, the doctors think it's...

07:48.802 --> 07:53.849
CTE, a brain disease
from repeated head injuries.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.810
Likely from boxing in the Navy, yeah.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.855
They can't tell for sure until I'm dead
and they cut me open.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.692
I need something out of my purse.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.309
Please don't stop on my account.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.897
I've had plenty of those moments myself.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.025
Not in front of him, I bet.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.071
But maybe that's why we have each other.

08:54.535 --> 08:58.705
You know,
he was more scared of you finding out

08:59.665 --> 09:02.501
and looking at him differently
than he was of the disease.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.217
I'm not tryna lose my man, Poppy.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.428
And I don't wanna lose my daddy.

09:14.930 --> 09:18.809
So we stand strong
against whatever's coming.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.437
And, Lillian.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.023
Lillian.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.610
We never turn on each other.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.281
I will be here every step of the way.
I promise.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.659
I promise.

09:39.079 --> 09:43.292
My source said that Sons of Ivar
are off the suspect list.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.002
You hear that from Aames?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.170
He would never.

09:47.129 --> 09:50.757
The official stance of the department
is that the case is still closed.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.177
What about Drew Turney?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.804
No priors, no notable affiliations.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.932
He was accepted into USC.
Deferred it for a year.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.518
-Wealthy family?
-Not especially.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.646
He was doing
the 20-something gig job grind

10:04.730 --> 10:07.608
and sharing a place with five roommates
until three months ago.

10:07.691 --> 10:11.528
He quit with no notice
and moved to a luxe studio in the Marina.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.322
None of 'em knew
where the money came from.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.573
But...

10:15.741 --> 10:18.410
Joshua's calls to Drew
started six months ago.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.746
No app, no intermediary.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.707
By last month,
the calls were almost daily.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.834
Sometimes lasting as long as an hour.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.504
So this was a full-blown relationship.

10:29.129 --> 10:34.384
A jealous wife is a strong motive,
but she was with you.

10:37.804 --> 10:38.805
Lord.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.100
What role am I supposed to serve here?

10:43.852 --> 10:45.145
Friend,

10:46.230 --> 10:47.397
confidant

10:48.690 --> 10:49.775
or journalist?

10:51.235 --> 10:54.655
I can't bury my friend
without any answers.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.461
You really don't wanna sit?

11:10.796 --> 11:13.590
Micah's fans make me a little nervous.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.677
I don't mind being near the exit.

11:25.936 --> 11:31.233
Thank you all for joining us in today's
celebration of the life of Joshua Keith.

11:32.109 --> 11:37.614
In order to free our grief,
we must release our minds.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.033
Close your eyes.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.120
Center your breathing.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.043
We're really doing this?

11:53.338 --> 11:54.339
Yeah.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.483
Ingram! Ingram!

12:28.040 --> 12:30.834
Grief lines up memories like dominoes.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.924
"This happened," grief tells us.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.051
"Then that."

12:39.134 --> 12:44.223
Until you have a series
of tidy narratives.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.143
And you roll them...

12:50.145 --> 12:52.648
backwards and forwards.

12:55.776 --> 12:59.571
Trying to make some sense of the...

13:01.573 --> 13:03.575
meaning, the finality...

13:07.621 --> 13:08.997
of death.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.375
We've got you, Micah.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.213
Thank you for your uplift.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.760
Any possible answer just brings up
yet another question,

13:21.844 --> 13:23.428
and it's an endless loop.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.350
And there's comfort.
There's comfort in the memories.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.520
There's comfort in the stories.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.649
But there's no way you can prepare
for pain or grief.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.235
Life is the preparation.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.153
I'll take your grief, Micah.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.615
No, no, no.
No scene in front of the investors.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.492
That's not making a fucking scene?

13:45.576 --> 13:46.994
It's okay.

13:50.873 --> 13:51.874
What's your name?

13:52.416 --> 13:53.417
Ruthie.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.713
Have you had to use our grief protocol
for your own journey?

13:57.796 --> 13:58.797
Yes.

14:00.174 --> 14:01.300
For my son.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.722
And when you were taking care of
everyone else, who was taking care of you?

14:07.514 --> 14:08.682
No one.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.935
My family tried,
but they rushed to move past it,

14:12.019 --> 14:15.439
and they didn't realize
they'd left me behind.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.652
I know exactly how you feel.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.449
Joshua...

14:27.993 --> 14:31.205
He wasn't perfect, but he was mine.

14:32.873 --> 14:37.503
And I will take the time to mourn his loss
without any judgment.

14:37.586 --> 14:43.258
Though everyone around me wants to judge
his work and his life.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.269
Would you like me to show you
to one of our recovery rooms?

14:54.895 --> 14:55.979
Yes.

14:56.605 --> 14:57.606
Okay.

15:00.817 --> 15:05.572
Micah always says touch is the most
important but ignored sense in grief.

15:05.656 --> 15:09.409
I'm gonna guess she meant
the consensual kind of touching.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.537
She saved me when I lost my son.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.206
Who's gonna save her?

15:14.706 --> 15:17.251
Micah appreciates your offer, she does.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.461
But she's on her own grief
journey at the moment.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.340
But she needs me.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.176
Would you tell her please?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.346
I'm always here for her.

15:32.766 --> 15:33.767
Sure.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.731
What in the world was that?

15:39.815 --> 15:41.149
Oh, my gosh.

15:45.529 --> 15:49.867
Do you need to head into the office?
I know you're in the middle of a case.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.910
Nah, don't worry about that.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.370
I'm fine.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.081
Noa and Markus are here.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.670
I'll call you tonight.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.635
Chanel?

16:09.303 --> 16:11.054
Looks like someone made the right decision

16:11.138 --> 16:13.348
to leave real reporting behind
for podcasting.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.351
I miss doing actual journalism with you.

16:16.894 --> 16:20.647
I was so sorry to hear your book flopped.

16:20.731 --> 16:24.234
Maybe I can blurb the second printing
if it ever gets there.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.907
Sorry, kale makes me bitchy.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.201
This isn't what I thought they meant
by "open bar."

16:32.951 --> 16:36.163
The day's not over.
I'm meeting Bob down at the Baywater.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.917
You know, Joshua loved nothing more
than a tacky tourist bar.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.669
I'd love to join.
Hear your take on the case.

16:42.753 --> 16:45.297
It won't be sanitized.
You'll hear things you wish you hadn't.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.798
I already have.

16:49.301 --> 16:53.639
No, no, no, the Ivar kooks have to be
on top of your investigative list.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.683
No doubt about it. You need
to get one of them on your show.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.520
You know,
on what planet is Micah not involved?

16:59.603 --> 17:01.355
She's creepy.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.440
-Her husband's having an affair.
-Stop.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.692
-I'm just saying--
-I mean it.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.695
You know, aside from the alibi,

17:09.780 --> 17:12.449
Micah's known about Joshua's skirt chasing
from the beginning.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.369
We all have,
except for prim Poppy over here.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.621
He's done this before?

17:18.288 --> 17:21.708
Are you kidding? He called
his indiscretions "road treats."

17:22.751 --> 17:23.836
It's an open secret.

17:23.919 --> 17:25.337
You wouldn't have to dig very much

17:25.420 --> 17:27.881
to find one of his past treats
for your podcast.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.467
Boys are new. Cheating's not.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.886
If you're doing the story, do it right.

17:32.970 --> 17:36.682
Like Joshua would've done
before Micah got her claws into him.

17:36.765 --> 17:40.686
Do not let her kill what's left
of your journalistic integrity.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.024
No, please.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.653
Don't stop on my account, Bobby.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.657
Tell me more about
what I've corrupted and killed.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.452
You can't pretend that
he wasn't diminished in recent years.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.789
Eclipsed by all your fame, success.

18:01.290 --> 18:05.919
Not so diminished that you didn't approach
him about partnering on a documentary.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.754
I was trying to help.

18:07.838 --> 18:10.883
There wasn't a hard news outlet
that would touch him anymore.

18:10.966 --> 18:13.760
Yeah, is that what he told you
or what you assumed?

18:14.928 --> 18:18.891
I'm starting to understand why you're
the only one here without a Pulitzer.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.351
Let's get outta here.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.022
He's always been such a prick.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.077
Damn it.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.712
Oh, shit.

19:32.714 --> 19:33.715
Come on.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.426
Come on. Come on. Come on.

20:03.745 --> 20:08.584
We need to talk about what I can
and cannot air on the podcast.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.668
Air it all.

20:10.627 --> 20:17.009
I've spent an entire career encouraging
radical acceptance and transparency.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.137
Can't change the rules now.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.474
Look what I got back today.

20:27.686 --> 20:30.772
The Victorians had mourning jewelry.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.526
Is that why you asked
for a lock of his hair?

20:35.152 --> 20:36.153
Yeah.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.573
I wanted the white over black

20:39.656 --> 20:43.076
indicating that he was unmarried
at the time of his death.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.244
Micah.

20:44.912 --> 20:48.415
Seems appropriate, right?
Dying in the arms of another man.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.169
But the jeweler talked me out of it.

20:52.836 --> 20:54.755
Did you know about his cheating?

21:02.721 --> 21:06.517
Three late-stage miscarriages
takes its toll.

21:08.644 --> 21:11.271
I was proud of the idea of being strong.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.524
It was very seductive.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.277
You know, being the woman who could...

21:19.988 --> 21:21.323
bear all the weight.

21:23.659 --> 21:24.952
But...

21:26.328 --> 21:27.454
I couldn't.

21:30.791 --> 21:31.959
We grew apart.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.089
He strayed.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.051
And I turned a blind eye.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.889
It hurt for a long time,
and then it didn't.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.853
And when we finally came up for air,

21:50.936 --> 21:54.523
we were both in a very different place.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.528
Why didn't you leave?

22:00.696 --> 22:02.489
I did not want to.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.158
I loved him.

22:06.577 --> 22:08.078
And I knew he'd be back.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.248
One day.

22:48.619 --> 22:51.455
Hey, Frank.
You still need relief on your shift?

22:53.415 --> 22:54.833
Route C on Piedmont.

22:57.044 --> 22:58.212
All right. I'm on my way.

23:08.639 --> 23:10.641
You sure about doing this story?

23:13.101 --> 23:16.063
I'm fine. I'm fine.

23:17.356 --> 23:19.942
What about you?
You gonna be able to handle Daddy?

23:20.859 --> 23:22.611
I just got called into work.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.156
You're the baby.

23:26.740 --> 23:28.909
Used to being taken care of.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.995
Just tell me if it's too much.

23:41.255 --> 23:42.422
It's too much.

23:48.804 --> 23:49.888
Okay.

23:52.975 --> 23:56.979
So why don't we sit down
with Desiree and Lillian

23:57.062 --> 23:58.730
and find out what you can do?

23:59.982 --> 24:01.733
I knew there was something wrong.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.236
We all did.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.488
Even when he said there wasn't.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.370
I can't be crying before work.
I got a long shift today.

24:14.288 --> 24:15.289
Okay.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.377
What?

24:23.505 --> 24:27.217
Noa let me listen to some of the segments
for this week's episode.

24:28.218 --> 24:31.805
About getting Joshua's case reopened.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.017
-And?
-That boy killed with Joshua,

24:35.100 --> 24:36.518
he had a life and a story too.

24:36.602 --> 24:37.895
Why aren't you talking about him?

24:37.978 --> 24:40.939
Because I don't know
how he fits into the motive yet.

24:41.607 --> 24:45.903
And why expose his family
other than what's absolutely necessary?

24:45.986 --> 24:47.696
Like you did to me.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.618
That weighs on me every day, Cydie.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.786
Still gives me nightmares.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.080
But don't erase that boy.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.464
Get in. Watch your head.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.092
Gotta take these out.

25:11.261 --> 25:14.014
Hold still. Put your hand flat.
Look at me. To the right.

25:34.576 --> 25:35.911
Mrs. Parnell.

25:39.957 --> 25:42.042
I am so sorry for your loss.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.628
These were my mother's favorite.

25:45.128 --> 25:47.172
And I still get them when I miss her.

25:47.923 --> 25:49.007
That's sweet.

25:49.925 --> 25:50.926
Thank you.

25:52.511 --> 25:56.348
Inspector Aames told us
not to cooperate with you.

25:56.431 --> 25:57.850
What changed your mind?

25:59.017 --> 26:00.686
He started ignoring us.

26:02.104 --> 26:05.566
Said the case was closed,
and we just couldn't accept the result.

26:05.649 --> 26:08.110
Our son may not have been a celebrity,
but he mattered.

26:09.570 --> 26:13.073
I watched a program last night where
they talked about the case for 20 minutes,

26:13.156 --> 26:15.033
they didn't say Drew's name once.

26:15.659 --> 26:18.996
You know, he deferred a year
at USC to do a fellowship.

26:19.079 --> 26:23.375
Said he wanted practical experience
working with a real artist.

26:24.209 --> 26:27.629
Joshua's associates
weren't aware of any fellowships.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.175
Why would he tell us that then?

26:39.141 --> 26:40.684
Mr. and Mrs. Turney,

26:40.767 --> 26:42.853
thank you for being
so generous with your time.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.188
This is a great start.

26:44.271 --> 26:46.899
-May I call with follow-ups?
-Please.

26:46.982 --> 26:48.817
Of course. Thank you.

26:48.901 --> 26:50.235
Hey, you two.

26:51.278 --> 26:52.321
Hi.

27:56.093 --> 27:57.261
Is that evidence?

28:00.848 --> 28:02.724
Micah asked me to stop by
and grab a few things

28:02.808 --> 28:04.184
before her livestream tonight.

28:05.686 --> 28:08.313
Did she ask you to attend
Drew's shiva too?

28:09.231 --> 28:10.524
That's what I do.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.484
That's what we all do at Shelter.

28:12.568 --> 28:16.113
We take care of things for her,
so she can continue to dazzle.

28:16.196 --> 28:19.324
Build her castle into the sky.
Brick by brick.

28:21.076 --> 28:22.286
You sound angry.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.289
At Shelter, we prefer grief-struck.

29:00.282 --> 29:01.742
What were you doing?

29:32.981 --> 29:36.151
-Hello?
-Esta. Yes.

29:36.235 --> 29:39.112
Poppy Parnell again. Do you have a minute?

29:39.696 --> 29:41.323
Did you find something?

29:42.074 --> 29:43.951
Something promising.

29:44.785 --> 29:49.164
But it may be a little painful to discuss.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.418
Was Drew adopted?

30:04.304 --> 30:06.723
Did he ever try to find
his biological parents?

30:06.807 --> 30:07.891
No.

30:07.975 --> 30:09.726
He knew that would devastate Arthur.

30:12.896 --> 30:14.231
He was our son.

30:14.314 --> 30:17.276
No, no one is questioning that.

30:20.612 --> 30:21.697
Thanks, Esta.

30:21.780 --> 30:24.491
-I'll be back in touch soon, okay?
-Thank you.

30:47.139 --> 30:49.433
How do we bottle and sell
that gut of yours?

30:49.516 --> 30:51.101
So the blood types
at the crime scene match?

30:51.185 --> 30:54.771
Both Joshua and Drew were AB negative.
The rarest type.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.859
Are we really about to top
murderous twins?

30:58.942 --> 31:01.486
We're not using this in the podcast.

31:01.570 --> 31:05.657
She's barely holding it together.
This is humiliating enough to break her.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.703
Are you joking? Micah gave
her permission, no limitations.

31:09.786 --> 31:13.582
It blows the official murder-suicide
theory of the case out of the water.

31:13.665 --> 31:15.626
Someone else will use it if we don't.

31:15.709 --> 31:18.921
So let them live with the repercussions
of their recklessness.

31:20.214 --> 31:21.590
What?

31:21.673 --> 31:23.926
You don't have ownership over guilt.

31:24.009 --> 31:25.344
So, why won't you back me?

31:25.427 --> 31:27.095
Because I don't believe in half measures.

31:27.179 --> 31:28.555
Either we do this, or we don't.

31:28.639 --> 31:30.432
It's my show, Noa.

31:37.481 --> 31:38.690
What's our status?

31:38.774 --> 31:41.568
The feed is ready.
We'll be live in 57 countries.

31:42.819 --> 31:43.820
No big deal.

31:48.283 --> 31:49.618
You think she's got this?

31:50.994 --> 31:52.204
Just curious.

32:02.923 --> 32:04.591
-Hey.
-Hi.

32:05.551 --> 32:08.345
Inversions. It's just lymphatic drainage.

32:09.179 --> 32:11.014
Mental reinvigoration.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.768
Circulation.

32:15.769 --> 32:18.063
So, how does it feel
to be back in the office?

32:18.689 --> 32:23.068
Is literally being upside down
a potent enough metaphor?

32:23.569 --> 32:25.863
It's too soon for you to be doing events.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.408
Yeah, well, my virtual fans
can't wait a week for me to grieve.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.661
We've been promoting
and hyping this event.

32:32.744 --> 32:34.830
If I cancel, I'll lose my investors.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.293
I went to Drew's shiva.

32:41.545 --> 32:43.881
And then I went to the studio.

32:47.384 --> 32:52.264
Joshua and Drew
had a slew of identical genetic features.

32:55.726 --> 32:57.811
I don't think Drew was his lover.

32:58.854 --> 33:00.355
I think he was his son.

33:03.775 --> 33:04.860
I'm so sorry. I--

33:04.943 --> 33:07.988
I'm not using any of this in the podcast,

33:08.071 --> 33:10.824
and we can suspend it entirely
if you prefer.

33:16.163 --> 33:17.164
Micah.

33:32.596 --> 33:35.349
Micah's talk is about to begin.
May I show you outside?

33:37.559 --> 33:39.686
Not just yet. Thank you.

33:41.563 --> 33:44.733
Sons of Ivar had nothing to do
with Drew and Josh's death,

33:44.816 --> 33:46.485
like I said the first time.

33:46.568 --> 33:48.237
You trying to convince me or yourself?

33:48.862 --> 33:50.072
But it got me thinking.

33:50.656 --> 33:53.867
Shelter, there's a lot of parallels,
lot of similarities.

33:53.951 --> 33:54.993
That's a stretch.

33:55.077 --> 33:57.454
Immunity blaster? No, you don't want one?

33:57.538 --> 34:00.207
Or you don't believe
in its restorative powers?

34:00.791 --> 34:02.042
A lot of people here do.

34:02.125 --> 34:05.629
Is there a purpose for this visit?
Because if not, you know, I...

34:06.880 --> 34:08.882
You know Jasper Gaines?

34:08.966 --> 34:10.967
My daddy's old running buddy?

34:11.051 --> 34:12.678
What do you remember about him?

34:13.887 --> 34:16.264
He was family, around all the time.

34:16.348 --> 34:19.309
He was at all of our birthdays growing up.
Why?

34:20.101 --> 34:23.438
Well, he killed seven people
from 1984 to 1989.

34:25.274 --> 34:28.860
For years, I was part of a task force
studying cults and fringe groups.

34:28.944 --> 34:32.531
Yeah, he's what we call
in the cult world, a follower.

34:33.907 --> 34:36.243
See, the thing about these groups
is that its members,

34:36.326 --> 34:38.036
they usually fall into two categories.

34:38.120 --> 34:42.206
The loyal followers
and the charismatic, narcissistic leaders.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.335
Shreve, Micah.

34:47.337 --> 34:48.797
They fit the profile.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.007
-You're so full of shit.
-Maybe,

34:52.050 --> 34:54.511
but as long as you're
poking around my case,

34:54.594 --> 34:55.971
making a mockery of detective work...

34:56.889 --> 34:58.307
Reopen the case.

35:34.718 --> 35:38.514
These are pieces
of what I once called home.

35:39.264 --> 35:42.226
They like to tell us, us women,

35:43.185 --> 35:45.062
to keep our house in order.

35:45.854 --> 35:48.106
But how in the hell are we supposed
to keep it in order

35:48.190 --> 35:50.067
when we were dealt a bum house?

35:57.908 --> 36:01.119
The first brick of any house...

36:04.039 --> 36:05.290
is trust.

36:08.085 --> 36:13.632
Trust in what you are building
and what you can withstand.

36:16.635 --> 36:18.887
For me, that represented my bedroom.

36:24.017 --> 36:25.185
The second brick...

36:44.204 --> 36:47.958
Keep your house in order.

36:49.585 --> 36:52.754
Keep your house in order.

36:53.338 --> 36:56.258
Maybe someone
should have told my husband that.

36:58.468 --> 36:59.803
I kept him solvent.

36:59.887 --> 37:05.100
I stood by him when his work
defied everything I stand for.

37:05.184 --> 37:06.185
And for what?

37:07.186 --> 37:09.313
So he could hide a son from me?

37:09.396 --> 37:11.773
So I could stand up here
and explain to everybody

37:11.857 --> 37:14.943
why my husband was murdered
protecting his child?

37:17.779 --> 37:19.740
What kind of safe shelter is that?

37:20.365 --> 37:22.534
At least when I was on the street,
I could--

37:24.661 --> 37:28.373
I knew better than to expect
anything from anyone!

37:28.457 --> 37:30.083
Micah. Micah.

37:30.584 --> 37:31.668
Micah.

37:35.297 --> 37:36.548
Cut the feed.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.310
It's quitting time.

38:30.686 --> 38:32.604
Make sure you sweep for lost items.

38:32.688 --> 38:35.274
I don't want that woman calling
and harassing me again.

38:36.275 --> 38:40.487
Patricia will find her excuse
to talk to a supervisor, believe that.

38:47.119 --> 38:49.079
A bitch is getting old.

38:52.833 --> 38:54.251
Okay.

39:00.215 --> 39:01.633
Where is that...

39:17.065 --> 39:19.109
You scared the shit outta me!

39:19.193 --> 39:22.070
You can't be in here.
The depot is private property.

39:22.154 --> 39:24.573
I'm sorry, I dozed off in the back here.

39:24.656 --> 39:26.074
I missed my stop.

39:31.455 --> 39:32.998
You do give a smooth ride.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.584
Not if I can't get off.

39:37.503 --> 39:38.754
That an invitation?

39:39.922 --> 39:41.006
Step off the bus.

40:16.416 --> 40:17.918
There was a guy on my bus.

40:18.502 --> 40:19.670
What's the description?

40:19.753 --> 40:22.297
Blue hoodie, blue jeans.

40:22.381 --> 40:26.176
Like, he's trying to scare me.
This dude is tall as fuck.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.469
We'll search the terminal.

40:28.720 --> 40:29.721
Jesus.

41:33.535 --> 41:35.454
You staying strong, baby girl?

41:38.373 --> 41:39.708
Well, you still standing.

41:43.837 --> 41:46.590
If you go online, don't scroll down.

41:50.844 --> 41:51.845
Yeah.

43:38.660 --> 43:39.828
What's going on?
