WEBVTT

00:02.373 --> 00:04.173
Yeah.
I think I know what I'm doing.

00:04.175 --> 00:05.975
But it's not a
championship line-up, Theodore.

00:05.977 --> 00:08.144
No one did as well as Taco,
who seems to have drafted Serena

00:08.146 --> 00:09.912
- Williams in the eighth round.
- I don't know what

00:09.914 --> 00:11.581
happened.
I got nervous.

00:11.583 --> 00:14.515
I meant to take her sister.
Well, it could be worse.

00:14.744 --> 00:16.878
You could be this guy.
Ruxin!

00:16.880 --> 00:18.713
Aw, look who it is.
What happened to you?

00:18.715 --> 00:21.983
You bailed on the draft.
Ooh!

00:21.985 --> 00:23.918
Boy...
Oh!

00:23.920 --> 00:25.720
- What happened?
- I got Rafied, which is

00:25.722 --> 00:27.755
worse than being roofied, trust
me.

00:27.757 --> 00:30.091
I feel like I need Ted's AIDS
cocktail.

00:30.093 --> 00:31.959
Bitch, you couldn't handle my
cocktail.

00:31.961 --> 00:34.228
No, no, you could not.
Wait, is this my team?

00:34.230 --> 00:36.264
I've got four kickers and no
quarterback.

00:36.266 --> 00:38.232
It looks worse than Aaron
Hernandez's alibi.

00:38.234 --> 00:39.867
What happened to Aaron
Hernandez?

00:39.869 --> 00:41.636
Is he okay?
Technically, this isn't

00:41.638 --> 00:43.104
really your team.
What? What do you mean?

00:43.106 --> 00:44.572
Yeah, you bailed on the draft.

00:44.574 --> 00:46.107
You are not in the league, my
friend.

00:46.109 --> 00:47.575
But I capitulated on
everything!

00:47.577 --> 00:49.110
I mean, what am I supposed to do
now?

00:49.112 --> 00:50.812
I would enjoy the wedding.
No!

00:50.814 --> 00:52.747
No, no, no, no!
I don't accept this.

00:52.749 --> 00:54.515
I'm leaving.
What's your room number, by

00:54.517 --> 00:56.184
the way, Ruxin?
My room number is eat my

00:56.186 --> 00:57.852
diseased dills.
Ugh.

00:57.854 --> 00:59.353
Jenny, I do have something
for you guys.

00:59.355 --> 01:00.922
What's your room number?
We're in 4...

01:00.924 --> 01:02.423
No, no, no!
D-D-Do not tell these animals

01:02.425 --> 01:04.425
what room we are in. Do not.
Why?

01:04.427 --> 01:06.594
Because this is what they do.
We like to go on road trips and

01:06.596 --> 01:10.164
sneak into each other's hotel
rooms and ransack the minibar.

01:10.166 --> 01:12.433
Like a pack of wolves.
I love that game.

01:12.435 --> 01:15.169
I even play it with strangers.
I'm in room 428, Kevin.

01:15.171 --> 01:17.104
Great. I don't care.
My room is not going to give

01:17.106 --> 01:18.973
you AIDS.
Someone's room gave you AIDS,

01:18.975 --> 01:20.641
- Ted.
- Whoa, hey, hey!

01:20.643 --> 01:22.343
Put this away.
Trixie cannot see this board.

01:22.345 --> 01:24.045
Hey, hey! Easy!
Trixie cannot find out that

01:24.047 --> 01:25.813
we drafted last night.
I feel terrible about the whole

01:25.815 --> 01:27.482
thing.
Well, you should.

01:27.484 --> 01:29.217
All your running backs have the
same bye week.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.219
No, it's not that.
This morning, she asked me how

01:31.221 --> 01:33.454
the bachelor party was, and I
had to lie to her.

01:33.456 --> 01:35.690
Marriages begin and end with
lies; that's how it works.

01:35.692 --> 01:38.493
Well, I refuse to poison our
union.

01:38.495 --> 01:40.161
You mean more than you
already have with your

01:40.163 --> 01:41.763
widow-making death jizz?

01:41.883 --> 01:45.862

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:46.085 --> 01:47.004
So when's Heather getting here?

01:47.134 --> 01:48.800
Oh, she can't come.
She's, uh, eight months

01:48.802 --> 01:51.069
pregnant, so she can't fly.
Oh, man, that was gonna be my

01:51.071 --> 01:53.772
wedding gift for you.
To get my sister pregnant?

01:53.774 --> 01:56.241
No, I was gonna not have sex
with your sister.

01:56.243 --> 01:57.976
Oh.
I was gonna spare you the

01:57.978 --> 01:59.911
awkwardness of knowing that we
were rubbing wet spots on your

01:59.913 --> 02:01.780
special weekend.
Don't... please don't say

02:01.782 --> 02:03.448
"wet spots."
How did she even get

02:03.450 --> 02:05.417
pregnant?
She hates it in that hole.

02:05.419 --> 02:07.119
Okay.
Come on.

02:07.121 --> 02:09.187
You suckers ready for some
sun?

02:09.472 --> 02:11.139
Uh, uh, uh, no, no, no.
These are reserved.

02:11.141 --> 02:12.940
This is for Pete; that's for
Jenny.

02:12.942 --> 02:14.609
Yep.
First wife, second wife.

02:14.611 --> 02:16.611
W-What's that?
Kevin's like a Mormon without

02:16.613 --> 02:19.614
any of the financial prowess.
Second wife sits over here, so

02:19.616 --> 02:22.550
he can jack him off, and then
the first wife cups the balls,

02:22.552 --> 02:24.385
as is her right.
There's no jacking off.

02:24.387 --> 02:26.053
That's right.
It's full pene.

02:26.055 --> 02:27.789
There's no penetration,
Ruxin, please.

02:27.791 --> 02:29.590
Yeah, and then Ellie gets in
there and is like, "I want..."

02:29.592 --> 02:31.392
What? Stop it.
That's my niece you're

02:31.394 --> 02:33.060
talking about.
Yeah, but we were just

02:33.062 --> 02:34.629
talking about everyone getting
in the mix...

02:34.631 --> 02:36.164
Know some limits.
Watch yourself.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.899
What's wrong with you?
What's up, guys?

02:37.901 --> 02:39.567
Hey, guys.
Hey, Kevin.

02:39.569 --> 02:41.335
Here's a little sunblock.
You know how you burn behind the

02:41.337 --> 02:43.137
ears.
Oh, it's like a bad episode

02:43.139 --> 02:44.740
of <i>Big Love.</i>
There are no bad episodes of

02:44.741 --> 02:46.174

<i>I took your Wednesday.</i>
<i>That's gonna mess with</i>

07:17.246 --> 07:19.346
<i>my immune system.</i>
<i>What about my digestive</i>

07:19.348 --> 07:22.049
<i>system, Ted?!</i>
<i>It's gonna wreak havoc.</i>

07:22.051 --> 07:26.520
<i>- Oh! I gotta Yobogoya!</i>
<i>- Yes! Yeah! Whoo!</i>

07:26.522 --> 07:28.723
<i>Where's the nearest bathroom?</i>
<i>I think they're pretty far.</i>

07:28.725 --> 07:30.558
<i>No options!</i>
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

07:30.560 --> 07:32.126
<i>No options!</i>
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

07:32.128 --> 07:33.794
<i>Oh, God!</i>
<i>Yes!</i>

07:33.796 --> 07:35.563
<i>Wait for me!</i>
<i>I can't hold it!</i>

07:35.565 --> 07:38.866
<i>Go! Go, Kevin, go!</i>
<i>Go for it!</i>

07:38.868 --> 07:41.235
<i>I'm getting it!</i>
<i>Are you filming this?</i>

07:41.237 --> 07:43.738
<i>Oh, you beast!</i>

07:43.740 --> 07:46.373
<i>Seabiscuit!</i>

07:46.375 --> 07:49.076
<i>Oh, dibs on Seabiscuit.</i>
<i>It's my new team name.</i>

07:49.078 --> 07:51.278
<i>I'm not Seabiscuit!</i>
<i>I gotta have vacation</i>

07:51.280 --> 07:53.414
<i>sex with that.</i>
<i>Oh, my God, Pacific Ocean</i>

07:53.416 --> 07:56.134
<i>forever unclean!</i>

07:57.740 --> 08:00.347
Let's get our rehearsal
dinner on.

08:00.587 --> 08:02.387
After you.

08:02.507 --> 08:04.042
Hey, Goose, let me see my hats.

08:04.282 --> 08:07.850
'Cause I want to make sure
I know what I'm in for.

08:07.852 --> 08:11.454
You've got diabetic
gelato maker, old Japanese guy

08:11.456 --> 08:14.924
who sniffs young girls' panties,
and of course, the newsies

08:14.926 --> 08:17.660
molester collection.
Well, Kevin and the wives

08:17.662 --> 08:20.096
finally showing up.
Hey, how is everyone?

08:20.098 --> 08:22.198
Good. Can I interest you in
a cocktail?

08:22.200 --> 08:24.100
He's fine.
No, I'm fine, thank you.

08:24.102 --> 08:25.968
He's good.
How are you doing over here,

08:25.970 --> 08:28.804
Mr. King of the Wide Receivers?
I mean, look, I know you landed

08:28.806 --> 08:30.272
Calvin Johnson...
That's right.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.041
...but Calvin Johnson does
not a season make.

08:32.043 --> 08:34.342
I'll be honest with you,
I could use a great running

08:34.345 --> 08:36.345
back or two.
Uh-huh.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.547
I don't know what you're
doing with that one kicker

08:38.549 --> 08:41.049
of yours.
Hello, everyone, I'm Ruxin.

08:41.052 --> 08:43.885
I am the best man here
at the wedding.

08:43.888 --> 08:46.689
- You're the Goose!
- Goose!

08:46.691 --> 08:50.650
I would love to invite now
the father and mother of the

08:50.770 --> 08:54.396
groom, Mr. Burt and Gloria
Nozick up to say some words.

08:54.398 --> 08:57.166
Yeah!
Speech!

08:57.614 --> 08:59.747
Hi, everybody.
Hi.

08:59.749 --> 09:02.116
We're so proud of you,
Andre, and our lovely

09:02.118 --> 09:04.152
new daughter.
You're gorgeous.

09:04.154 --> 09:07.121
It was just such a short time
ago that he was a little boy.

09:07.123 --> 09:08.856
That's really what
it feels like.

09:08.858 --> 09:12.093
And he never really knew very
much about-about women.

09:12.095 --> 09:16.598
Remember, you guys, you guys,
you told him that women didn't

09:16.600 --> 09:18.833
have anything down there.
Oh, that's right.

09:18.835 --> 09:20.501
That they were like
Barbie dolls.

09:20.503 --> 09:22.170
You called it
"smooth saddles."

09:22.172 --> 09:24.105
Yes.

09:24.107 --> 09:27.141
To smooth saddles.
Oh! I got, I got a surprise.

09:27.143 --> 09:29.210
Something amazing is
what he means.

09:29.212 --> 09:31.813
Something incredible.
Something sweet and beautiful.

09:31.815 --> 09:35.683
Here we go. Ta-da.

09:35.685 --> 09:39.821
It's a Kluneberg!
Penis Andre is attacking

09:39.823 --> 09:42.056
Anus Trixie.
This is an important work.

09:42.058 --> 09:43.825
It recontextualizes
everything I know about

09:43.827 --> 09:46.494
the penis.
It's a valuable addition to

09:46.496 --> 09:48.463
anyone's personal collection.
Coming up big,

09:48.465 --> 09:51.366
Mr. and Mrs. N!
Yay!

09:51.368 --> 09:53.468
N! N!
They're early front-runners

09:53.470 --> 09:56.037
for MVP of the wedding,
Mr. and Mrs. Nozick.

09:56.039 --> 09:59.040
Okay, would anybody else like
to say some words?

09:59.042 --> 10:01.843
I've got a little something.
Ah, Ted would like to speak.

10:01.845 --> 10:05.346
So from MVPs to A-I-Ds.
Everybody, Ted.

10:05.348 --> 10:08.883
Thank you, Goose.

10:08.885 --> 10:13.755
You know, they say a good
marriage is like a team.

10:13.757 --> 10:17.358
I cannot imagine you two apart.
Andre without Trixie?

10:17.360 --> 10:20.862
That's like having great, great
wide receivers and no

10:20.864 --> 10:23.431
running backs.
Or at least over-the-hill

10:23.433 --> 10:25.667
and injury-prone ones.
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

10:25.669 --> 10:28.202
Did I just say great
wide receivers?

10:28.204 --> 10:31.873
I'm sorry, no.
Trix, if half of what this man

10:31.875 --> 10:34.375
has tweeted about you is true,
then you're the best.

10:34.377 --> 10:38.112
You are the Calvin Johnson
of brides.

10:38.114 --> 10:42.717
A true number one.
And here you are tonight.

10:42.719 --> 10:45.086
You're so beautiful.
Calvin Johnson being

10:45.088 --> 10:48.189
offered up!
And I know that anyone here--

10:48.191 --> 10:52.593
Andre, anyone.
Anyone or Andre is going to have

10:52.595 --> 10:56.864
to give up something very big in
order to get you in his lineup.

10:56.866 --> 10:59.434
But I'll tell you what.
That is gonna make both parties

10:59.436 --> 11:01.436
in this matrimonial transaction
exceedingly happy for the

11:01.438 --> 11:04.238
upcoming season,
or for all time.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.308
The floor is open.
Wow! Great speech.

11:07.310 --> 11:09.711
Ted, do you mind if
I say a word?

11:09.713 --> 11:11.713
No, I don't mind a bit.
Thank you.

11:11.715 --> 11:13.748
And congratulations, Andre,
and to you, Trixie.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.651
All this talk about weddings and

11:16.653 --> 11:19.454
marriage and teams reminds me of
the day of my wedding.

11:19.456 --> 11:22.090
The day that I found my number
one draft pick Calvin Johnson.

11:22.092 --> 11:25.493
The day I married my Jenny.

11:25.495 --> 11:28.162
Aw...
I would have traded

11:28.164 --> 11:31.399
anything to get her.
She's the most...

11:31.401 --> 11:35.470
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
This is not my forte.

11:35.472 --> 11:38.439
Matt Forte.
Matt Forte.

11:38.441 --> 11:40.408
He said, "No, it's
not my forte."

11:40.410 --> 11:42.744
That's an interesting speech,
Kevin.

11:42.746 --> 11:47.648
Uh, do you have any more
you would want to offer?

11:47.650 --> 11:50.985
No, thank you.
Uh, I just want to say,

11:50.987 --> 11:53.654
Andre and Trixie, you're
a beautiful couple.

11:53.656 --> 11:56.124
You know, if I could just
better Kevin's toast...

11:56.126 --> 11:59.193
Okay, please don't.
No, Kevin's toast was fair,

11:59.195 --> 12:01.629
and I don't think it <i>can</i>
<i>be better.</i>

12:01.631 --> 12:04.298
<i>It's about you, Andre.</i>
<i>How dependable you are.</i>

12:04.300 --> 12:07.268
<i>Mm.</i>
<i>Week after week, and how</i>

12:07.270 --> 12:09.837
<i>important it is to have someone</i>
<i>like that on your team.</i>

12:09.839 --> 12:12.673
<i>I believe it was the great poet</i>
<i>Marshawn Lynch...</i>

12:12.675 --> 12:15.143
<i>Marshawn Lynch? I don't...</i>
<i>Who is that?</i>

12:15.145 --> 12:17.512
<i>He was originally from</i>
<i>Buffalo, then he became a poet</i>

12:17.514 --> 12:21.449
<i>in the Northwest.</i>
<i>...who once said, "I am</i>

12:21.451 --> 12:23.618
<i>a stud.</i>
<i>I'm an every down type</i>

12:23.620 --> 12:26.287
<i>of player...</i>
<i>even in garbage time."</i>

12:26.289 --> 12:30.124
<i>Jamaal Charles!</i>
<i>Not many of you are gonna</i>

12:30.126 --> 12:31.659
<i>understand that.</i>
<i>That's sort of an</i>

12:31.661 --> 12:33.494
<i>inside joke, but...</i>
<i>Drop it! Drop it!</i>

12:33.496 --> 12:36.564
<i>...Jamaal Charles!</i>
<i>I don't really get</i>

12:36.566 --> 12:38.533
<i>Andre's friends.</i>
<i>I think they're just maybe</i>

12:38.535 --> 12:40.668
<i>not very bright.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

12:40.670 --> 12:42.637
<i>I accept Pete's speech.</i>
<i>Cock and balls!</i>

12:42.639 --> 12:44.305
<i>Yes!</i>
<i>So moving.</i>

12:44.307 --> 12:46.207
<i>How do we all feel?</i>
<i>Ratified, ratified.</i>

12:46.209 --> 12:49.811
<i>Done. To Andre and Trixie.</i>
<i>To Andre and Trixie! Yeah!</i>

12:49.813 --> 12:52.814
<i>Yay!</i>
<i>Weirdest goddamn rehearsal</i>

12:52.816 --> 12:54.582
<i>dinner I've ever been to.</i>
<i>I'm not understanding</i>

12:54.584 --> 12:56.684
<i>these speeches.</i>
<i>I feel like something is</i>

12:56.686 --> 12:59.020
<i>going on.</i>
<i>Is this a fantasy league thing?</i>

12:59.022 --> 13:02.256
<i>What? No, no, no.</i>
<i>Right? Right?</i>

13:02.258 --> 13:04.559
<i>You screwed me!</i>
<i>You gave me traids.</i>

13:04.561 --> 13:06.494
<i>Stop it. I might have gave</i>
<i>you trerpes.</i>

13:06.496 --> 13:08.596
<i>No, it was full-blown</i>
<i>traids!</i>

13:08.598 --> 13:10.731
<i>Hey, you guys are way too</i>
<i>serious about speeches.</i>

13:10.733 --> 13:12.600
<i>They were all good.</i>
<i>Whoa! Kevin, Pete really</i>

13:12.602 --> 13:14.869
<i>just screwed you.</i>
<i>Reminds me of when I was in</i>

13:14.871 --> 13:16.938
<i>the league.</i>
<i>Speaking of, when are you guys</i>

13:16.940 --> 13:19.240
<i>gonna have that vote about</i>
<i>voting me back in the league?</i>

13:19.242 --> 13:21.075
<i>What vote?</i>
<i>What?</i>

13:21.077 --> 13:23.177
<i>Jenny said you guys were</i>
<i>holding a vote as to whether I</i>

13:23.179 --> 13:24.879
<i>was gonna be back in the league.</i>
<i>Whoops.</i>

13:24.881 --> 13:28.282
<i>Whoops? That's all you have</i>
<i>to say in your little slutty</i>

13:28.284 --> 13:30.918
<i>leprechaun outfit?</i>
<i>I think, uh, we got a little</i>

13:30.920 --> 13:33.621
<i>bit off track here, didn't we?</i>
<i>And what better way to get back</i>

13:33.623 --> 13:36.524
<i>on track than a speech</i>
<i>from my Goose?</i>

13:36.526 --> 13:39.227
<i>You want a goose?</i>
<i>I'm gonna shove my hand up all</i>

13:39.229 --> 13:41.629
<i>of your asses, pull your</i>
<i>intestines out, and then hang</i>

13:41.631 --> 13:45.265
<i>you with them.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

13:45.267 --> 13:48.870
<i>Top Groom!</i>
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

13:49.927 --> 13:51.335
It just hurts.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.073
When he undermines my trades,
it bothers me.

13:54.193 --> 13:57.142
You're sitting here,
complaining to your real wife

13:57.170 --> 13:59.429
about Pete, your fake wife.

13:59.469 --> 14:02.510
I am not complaining to you. I am just
looking to you for a little support.

14:02.630 --> 14:03.948
Guys, where's Ruxin?

14:04.068 --> 14:07.201
Oh, he is still goosing it up over there.
Cap me, Goose.

14:07.321 --> 14:10.122
Well, that's perfect
because I swiped that fool's

14:10.242 --> 14:11.975
hotel key.
When we get back to that

14:11.977 --> 14:13.944
hotel, we're gonna obliterate
that minibar.

14:13.946 --> 14:15.679
That's right.
Let's get out of here.

14:15.681 --> 14:16.881
I want to...
By the way, Kevin,

14:16.930 --> 14:18.176
I heard what you have to say.
Your feelings are valid,

14:18.296 --> 14:20.859
but you're still gonna lose.
Well, at least you

14:20.979 --> 14:22.617
acknowledged the fact that you
hurt me.

14:22.733 --> 14:24.666
So, you guys are staying in
separate rooms?

14:24.668 --> 14:26.668
It's marital tradition.
We sleep in separate rooms.

14:26.670 --> 14:27.515
I won't see her until the
wedding.

14:27.615 --> 14:29.448
Are you jacking off like crazy?

14:29.450 --> 14:32.051
No, I'm saving myself.
I'm practicing fap-stinence.

14:32.053 --> 14:34.053
Hmm.
You guys all know how the

14:34.055 --> 14:37.256
British call masturbating
"fapping."

14:37.258 --> 14:40.125
So I am fap-staining.

14:40.127 --> 14:42.127
Okay, wait, you're rocking a
full load of laundry right now?

14:42.129 --> 14:44.129
Yeah.
No, no, no.

14:44.131 --> 14:46.232
Andre, you got to avoid the
juggernut.

14:46.234 --> 14:48.567
The juggernut?
You got a packed Brazilian

14:48.569 --> 14:50.803
nightclub in your pants and
there's only one exit.

14:50.805 --> 14:53.472
As soon as the fire starts,
people are gonna get hurt.

14:53.474 --> 14:55.608
You got to start letting peoepl
out now.

14:55.610 --> 14:57.610
But I don't have my stuff.
I don't have my usual materials.

14:57.612 --> 14:59.612
Fear not.
I'll take care of it.

14:59.614 --> 15:02.047
As my gift to you I will be your
jack butler.

15:02.049 --> 15:04.250
Your right hand's right-hand
man.

15:04.252 --> 15:07.920
Ruxin.

15:07.922 --> 15:10.623
Ruxy?
Ruxin?

15:10.625 --> 15:13.058
Hey, buddy.
Commence...

15:13.060 --> 15:15.094
Let's go.

15:15.096 --> 15:17.096
Taco!
Ten dollars, $20.

15:17.098 --> 15:20.099
Expensive gin.
Expensive American beer.

15:20.101 --> 15:23.802
Beautiful.
Oh, yes, so expensive!

15:23.804 --> 15:28.674
Nuts, go nuts!
$20 chips!

15:28.676 --> 15:31.477
Ruxin just bought a robe!

15:31.479 --> 15:33.946
Guys, guys, guys!
Ruxin wants room service.

15:33.948 --> 15:38.183
Hello, can we have menu, please?

15:38.185 --> 15:41.287
- Lunch and dinner.
- ♪ Shiva Komedi

15:41.289 --> 15:45.457
Somakanakram
Shiva Komedi Somakanakram ♪

15:45.459 --> 15:47.459
Hey!

15:47.461 --> 15:49.461
Guys, guys, wait, he's here,
he's here...

15:49.463 --> 15:53.098
He's coming.
I can't wait to see his face.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.534
Hey!
What the hell's going on here?

15:55.536 --> 15:57.536
Oh, we thought this was
Ruxin's room.

15:57.538 --> 15:59.538
This is not Ruxin's room.
This is my room.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.540
Oh, he must've switched the
keys.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.542
This is not gonna fly.
And you guys are gonna pay for

16:03.544 --> 16:05.911
this.

16:05.913 --> 16:09.848
Shit!
Run!

16:09.850 --> 16:13.152
Run!

16:13.154 --> 16:18.324
I'm about to add five to my
sack total.

16:18.326 --> 16:21.894
He's so big!
Ah, giant Ruxin is coming!

16:21.896 --> 16:23.729
Go, go, go!
Run, you guys, run, run,

16:23.731 --> 16:25.564
run, run, run!
Nobody messes with my

16:25.566 --> 16:27.566
minibar!
J.J., no!

16:27.568 --> 16:29.568
You're mine, meat!
Feed him Ted first.

16:33.845 --> 16:36.126
Andre, since your sister's
not here for me to not have sex

16:36.216 --> 16:38.210
with her, I got you a couple
other gifts.

16:38.804 --> 16:42.271
Ta-da!
Your very own personalized pee bib.

16:42.391 --> 16:43.266
Oh, you got it monogrammed

16:43.386 --> 16:44.516
and everything.
That's for your first piss as

16:44.518 --> 16:48.898
a married man.
And more importantly, got you

16:49.018 --> 16:52.009
some porn.
So you can avoid that juggernut of yours.

16:52.129 --> 16:53.210
Do I really have to do that?

16:53.330 --> 16:54.526
You got to avoid the juggernut.

16:54.528 --> 16:57.262
You take that, throw it in a
DVD player, whip out that little

16:57.264 --> 16:59.598
penis of yours, go to town.
Spit that poisonous venom out of

16:59.600 --> 17:01.600
yourself.
No, no, no.

17:01.602 --> 17:03.602
I'm not gonna do it in front of
you.

17:03.604 --> 17:05.604
I'm your jack butler.
I know how to jerk off.

17:05.606 --> 17:07.606
Do you want to take the shirt
off or you gonna keep it on?

17:07.608 --> 17:10.409
I'm gonna do it by myself.
That's so weird.

17:10.411 --> 17:12.411
Well, get out of here, man.
All right, I want you jerking

17:12.413 --> 17:14.413
off in there in one minute.
All right, go.

17:14.415 --> 17:16.415
No-look jelly.
Bam!

17:16.416 --> 17:18.416
You nasty, tiny jelly.
You nasty.

17:18.419 --> 17:20.886
No.
No, no, too much, Ruxin!

17:20.887 --> 17:23.722
Oh, come on, that's my shirt.
That's our minibar.

17:23.723 --> 17:26.023
Those are my condoms, I was
gonna pretend to use those.

17:26.026 --> 17:28.627
Hey, I would've drank that.
Have you guys seen how

17:28.629 --> 17:31.630
expensive this stuff is?
You know, I know you guys are

17:31.632 --> 17:34.233
worried about J.J. and I.
We settled our differences, and

17:34.235 --> 17:37.269
when I grabbed all of your room
keys, I thought who better to

17:37.271 --> 17:39.405
give them to than this man right
here.

17:39.407 --> 17:41.407
And I know what room you're
in now.

17:41.409 --> 17:43.409
Lobby.
Nailed it.

17:43.411 --> 17:45.244
Hey!
Everything?

17:45.246 --> 17:47.780
You know, dude can't draft
for shit, but he can get even

17:47.782 --> 17:49.915
like a...
Charge it to the room.

17:49.917 --> 17:51.917
To the room!
To the room.

17:51.919 --> 17:54.086
Not to the room.
No, no, no, no, no!

17:54.088 --> 17:56.221
Tap water, drink tap water.
It's delicious.

17:56.223 --> 17:58.424
No, it's not from Fiji.
Look at this, guys.

17:58.426 --> 18:00.426
We got lobster.
This has to be, like, 250 bucks.

18:00.428 --> 18:02.428
Don't-don't open that.
Don't touch the lobster.

18:02.430 --> 18:04.430
J.J., please don't open the
lobster!

18:04.432 --> 18:07.800
Damn it, come on, man!
My wedding is in four hours.

18:07.802 --> 18:09.802
What are you doing?
Getting dressed?

18:09.804 --> 18:14.406
Is that what I think it is?
Um...

18:14.408 --> 18:16.942
no?
No, that's last year's board.

18:16.944 --> 18:20.012
That's not this year's board.
Why does that say 2013?

18:20.014 --> 18:22.748
Uh, because that's the year
it was then, Pixie.

18:22.750 --> 18:27.085
Do you know what?
I am so sick of your bullshit!

18:27.087 --> 18:29.488
I don't even like any of you
people.

18:29.490 --> 18:33.292
You have horrible style.
This is my wedding!

18:33.294 --> 18:35.294
your league!
Hey!

18:35.296 --> 18:37.296
it!
Relax.

18:37.298 --> 18:39.298
Wow.
Andre!

18:39.300 --> 18:42.301
R.I.P. to the league, y'all.
What?

18:42.303 --> 18:44.603
(woman passionately moaning on

18:44.605 --> 18:46.939
computer)

18:54.782 --> 18:56.782
Almost lost my foreskin on
that one.

18:56.784 --> 18:59.184
Taco?

18:59.186 --> 19:01.186
We should clean up before
Andre gets home, right?

19:01.188 --> 19:03.188
Nah, you're family, come on.
Just let it dry.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.324
Heather?
Man, I love Andre's <i>Star Wars</i>

19:05.326 --> 19:07.326
<i>sheets.</i>
<i>Oh, God!</i>

19:07.328 --> 19:10.462
<i>I'm gonna throw up.</i>
<i>Ooh, hey, honey.</i>

19:10.464 --> 19:12.464
<i>What the hell, Andre?</i>
<i>What?</i>

19:12.466 --> 19:14.466
<i>You had a draft at our wedding?</i>

19:14.468 --> 19:16.468
<i>Okay...</i>
<i>I can explain, look, I wasn't...</i>

19:16.470 --> 19:18.470
<i>I don't want any of your</i>
<i>lies, I don't want any of your</i>

19:18.472 --> 19:20.806
<i>stupid lies.</i>
<i>I'm not a liar.</i>

19:20.808 --> 19:22.808
<i>What happened to trust?</i>
<i>Please...</i>

19:22.810 --> 19:24.977
<i>What happened to our weekend?</i>
<i>Why are your pants unzipped?</i>

19:24.979 --> 19:26.812
<i>I'm doing this for us.</i>
<i>I was trying to avoid the</i>

19:26.814 --> 19:28.814
<i>juggernut.</i>
<i>The juggernut?</i>

19:28.816 --> 19:30.816
<i>My God, you are not the man that</i>
<i>I thought you were.</i>

19:30.818 --> 19:32.818
<i>No, I am the man, look...</i>
<i>I-I got the doves and I got the</i>

19:32.820 --> 19:34.820
<i>three different outfits for the</i>
<i>wedding...</i>

19:34.822 --> 19:36.822
<i>How can there be a wedding,</i>
<i>Andre?</i>

19:36.824 --> 19:38.824
<i>You cheated on me with your</i>
<i>league!</i>

19:38.826 --> 19:40.559
<i>All right, please...</i>
<i>I can, I can...</i>

19:40.561 --> 19:42.661
<i>Don't-don't-don't cry...</i>
<i>Please don't touch me, don't</i>

19:42.663 --> 19:45.063
<i>even touch me...</i>
<i>I'm gonna ruin my makeup.</i>

19:45.065 --> 19:47.065
<i>Oh, no, no, no!</i>

19:47.067 --> 19:49.234
<i>My eyes!</i>

19:49.236 --> 19:51.236
<i>Sorry, I didn't mean...</i>
<i>Stay away from me, you stay</i>

19:51.238 --> 19:53.238
<i>away from me...</i>
<i>Okay, I didn't mean to, come</i>

19:53.240 --> 19:55.541
<i>on, I'm so sorry!</i>
<i>Trixie, forgive me, come on...</i>

19:55.543 --> 19:59.344
<i>Trixie!</i>
<i>No, Trixie, no.</i>

19:59.346 --> 20:03.949
<i>So, wait, you masturbated and</i>
<i>she</i> went blind?

20:03.951 --> 20:05.951
Yeah.
I wonder if she grew hair

20:05.953 --> 20:07.953
on her hands, too?
Why didn't you go with her,

20:07.955 --> 20:10.055
Andre?
She doesn't want me to.

20:10.057 --> 20:13.292
She said it's over.
So, first wife, second wife,

20:13.294 --> 20:15.360
no wife?
Ow.

20:15.362 --> 20:17.529
All right, guys, after
today's events, I think it's

20:17.531 --> 20:19.865
time we put this horseshit
behavior behind us.

20:19.867 --> 20:25.571
One of us is really hurting.
Ruxin?

20:25.573 --> 20:28.206
Am I back in the league?
Would you like to be back in

20:28.208 --> 20:30.242
the league?
Oh, my God.

20:30.244 --> 20:32.644
Come here, guys.
Bring it in, bring it in.

20:32.646 --> 20:35.550
All right.
Yeah, let's celebrate.

20:35.670 --> 20:37.670
Andre, why don't you get us all
a bucket of beers?

20:37.672 --> 20:39.739
Mm-hmm.
But don't put your jizz-riled

20:39.741 --> 20:41.774
hands on 'em, okay?
