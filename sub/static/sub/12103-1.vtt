01:06.220 --> 01:09.420
Cody Banks wins again for Dorm Seven.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.500
Sorry about the boot-kick, Frank.

01:14.540 --> 01:15.540
No problem.

01:15.580 --> 01:16.660
Sorry?!

01:18.380 --> 01:21.380
You don't apologize to your enemy!

01:22.540 --> 01:24.260
But Frank's my friend.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.300
Friends, enemies, everybody,
they're all the same.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.300
Remember, trust equals death.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.540
Now you go write that
on your lunch box, Banks.

01:36.740 --> 01:37.940
Sir?

01:37.980 --> 01:39.700
You dropped your ball.

01:42.140 --> 01:43.900
Remember, kid...

01:43.940 --> 01:44.940
trust nobody.

01:46.260 --> 01:47.500
Including me.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.900
Bomb disposal time starts...now.

02:16.420 --> 02:18.180
Prepare for satellite launch.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.500
Hey, Cody.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.540
Can I get you anything?

02:33.580 --> 02:35.100
Covert op? Recon mission?

02:35.140 --> 02:36.060
Juice box?

02:36.100 --> 02:38.660
No. No, I'm fine.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.180
Well, we're right here
if you need anything.

02:40.220 --> 02:43.500
You know us, U.S.A.
first, Cody Banks second...

02:43.535 --> 02:45.780
then Mom and apple pie tied for third.

02:46.820 --> 02:47.740
Thanks.

02:47.780 --> 02:48.900
Commence satellite launch.

02:48.940 --> 02:51.140
T-minus ten, nine...

02:51.180 --> 02:53.540
eighth, seven, six...

02:53.580 --> 02:55.900
five,
four--

02:55.940 --> 02:58.100
Code forty-two! Abort! Abort!

02:58.140 --> 03:00.580
Attention all campers. Code forty-two.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.300
Code forty-two.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.700
Code forty-two. This is it.

03:07.740 --> 03:08.740
Go time! Go time!

03:08.780 --> 03:11.740
Guys, code forty-two is Parents' Day.

03:11.780 --> 03:13.620
Take your positions.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.820
Bring 'em on.

03:14.860 --> 03:17.500
Code forty-two. This is not a drill.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.460
Initiate concealment sequence!

04:06.860 --> 04:07.820
Quick! Quick!

04:07.855 --> 04:08.780
Just hurry!

04:18.540 --> 04:19.620
Geronimo!

04:19.660 --> 04:21.660
Cannonball!

04:21.700 --> 04:22.620
Park over there, hon.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.580
I was gonna park here.

04:23.620 --> 04:24.620
In this space?

04:24.660 --> 04:26.020
Yes, What's wrong with
it? Is this all right?

04:26.060 --> 04:26.980
Well, you're too close to the lake.

04:27.020 --> 04:28.500
You drive next time.

04:31.340 --> 04:32.900
I'm hungry.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.500
So where do you think he is?

04:46.540 --> 04:47.860
Well, I don't know.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.860
If he, like, drowned in
a lake or something...

04:49.900 --> 04:50.820
can I have his computer?

04:50.860 --> 04:52.100
Alex!

04:52.140 --> 04:53.065
What?

04:53.100 --> 04:55.140
Be nice. He's your brother.

04:55.180 --> 04:56.420
He's a whack job.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.940
Isn't there some sort
of exchange program...

04:58.980 --> 05:01.260
we could trade him in
for, like, a hot chick...

05:01.300 --> 05:02.820
or a pack of gum?

05:02.860 --> 05:05.500
Honey, will you stop calling
your brother a whack job?

05:05.540 --> 05:07.900
He thinks he's in the ClA.

05:07.940 --> 05:08.860
Yeah, Right.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.020
He thinks he's in the ClA.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.980
I think somebody needs
a little more attention.

05:14.220 --> 05:15.780
So down here in the office?

05:15.820 --> 05:16.820
Is this the office?

05:16.860 --> 05:17.780
Honey, I don't know.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.300
I've never been here before.

05:19.340 --> 05:20.780
I don't know, I can't see him anywhere.

05:20.815 --> 05:21.860
I don't know. We
gotta be able--

05:21.900 --> 05:23.620
Hey! Honey!

05:26.300 --> 05:28.220
Hey, buddy. How you doin'?

05:28.260 --> 05:29.180
Nice to see ya.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.780
Good news about Wall Street, huh?

05:30.820 --> 05:33.100
I've been following the
stock market like a hawk...

05:33.140 --> 05:35.980
and I guess things are looking
rosy again on the Nasdaq.

05:36.020 --> 05:37.420
What are you talking about, Cody?

05:37.460 --> 05:38.460
Stock market?

05:38.500 --> 05:40.220
Are you sixteen or sixty?

05:40.260 --> 05:42.060
Alex, little rascal.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.420
Hey, is that my Video Now?

05:44.460 --> 05:47.180
How'd that get in my pocket?

05:47.215 --> 05:48.660
You can have it.

05:48.700 --> 05:49.700
Really?

05:49.740 --> 05:53.020
Yeah. Yo, we have a few hours
before the bonfire starts...

05:53.060 --> 05:54.420
so I'll go get you guys a beverage.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.540
A beverage?

05:57.700 --> 05:58.900
Do you know how long
this is going on for?

05:58.940 --> 06:00.900
I don't know.

06:00.940 --> 06:03.220
A couple hours.
Maybe two, three--

06:06.660 --> 06:08.740
Thank you, everybody,
and welcome to Kamp Woody.

06:10.020 --> 06:12.260
Now, I am the
Commander-in-chief here--

06:12.300 --> 06:14.340
I mean, head counselor.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.940
My name is Victor Diaz.

06:17.980 --> 06:20.620
Captain Squishy! Captain Squishy!

06:22.340 --> 06:26.020
A.K.A. Captain Squishy, Captain Squishy.

06:26.060 --> 06:26.980
That's funny.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.340
That's cute.

06:28.380 --> 06:29.380
Parents, you should know...

06:29.420 --> 06:31.820
that your kids are having
a great summer here.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.820
In the very first
week of debriefing--

06:34.860 --> 06:37.380
I mean, getting to
know, getting to know...

06:37.420 --> 06:40.260
getting to know each other.

06:41.380 --> 06:44.420
Right through to
learning about America...

06:45.100 --> 06:47.620
and her so-called friends...

06:47.660 --> 06:52.340
who smile at your face while
stabbing you in the back.

06:52.380 --> 06:54.260
I just wanted him to learn how to swim.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.420
And canoeing.

06:55.460 --> 06:58.020
We do a lot of canoeing here.

06:58.060 --> 07:00.140
Now, I'm pretty sure
that you're anxious...

07:00.180 --> 07:04.340
to get on the road, so why
don't we follow camp protocol...

07:04.380 --> 07:10.980
and end Parents' Day by
singing the camp song?

07:11.020 --> 07:12.740
One, two, three.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.940
Oh, lovely Kamp Woody

07:15.980 --> 07:17.700
With your trees full of bark

07:17.740 --> 07:19.340
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

07:19.380 --> 07:20.300
That's nice.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.020
Oh, pretty Kamp Woody

07:22.060 --> 07:23.860
It's our country park

07:23.900 --> 07:25.225
Our country park

07:25.260 --> 07:28.220
We love you, Kamp Woody

07:28.260 --> 07:30.260
We're not what we seem

07:31.460 --> 07:34.180
We're all undercover

07:34.220 --> 07:36.860
And, oh, what a team

07:36.900 --> 07:38.980
Kamp Woody!

07:39.460 --> 07:42.380
Oh, we miss you, pumpkin.

07:42.780 --> 07:44.180
Do you miss us?

07:44.220 --> 07:46.020
Of course, I miss you guys.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.260
So, drive carefully.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.500
What's this?

07:54.540 --> 07:56.060
Just, you know, nail clippers.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.500
Oh, honey.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.220
I don't feel right about
you having a weapon.

07:59.260 --> 08:00.180
A weapon?

08:00.220 --> 08:02.300
It looks so sharp. Let me have it.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.260
Dad?

08:03.300 --> 08:04.580
Come on, just give it to her.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.540
We've got a three-hour drive.

08:05.580 --> 08:06.580
Come on.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.940
I love you, sweetie.

08:11.980 --> 08:12.900
Take it easy, buddy.

08:12.940 --> 08:13.860
See ya, Alex.

08:13.900 --> 08:14.820
Whatever.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.060
Bye, Cody!

08:16.100 --> 08:17.020
Bye, honey.

08:31.980 --> 08:34.900
I just love the smell of
summer camp in the evening.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.340
We're going in. Over.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.740
Ryan, get up! Come on!

08:50.780 --> 08:52.580
-Get up!
-What is it?

08:52.620 --> 08:54.460
Initiating troop drop.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.020
Good luck, guys.

08:56.060 --> 08:58.460
Preparing for landing. Standby. Over.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.540
Sir, what's going on?

09:03.580 --> 09:05.820
What do you think? It's a drill.

09:05.860 --> 09:07.700
I'm puttin' you in charge. Run the op.

09:07.740 --> 09:08.940
Come on, Banks, You're in charge.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.340
Run the operation.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.780
What's the enemy's objective?

09:11.820 --> 09:13.260
Let's say I'm the target.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.340
What do you do?

09:15.380 --> 09:16.900
Protect the target at all costs!

09:16.940 --> 09:18.660
Just get me out of here, Banks.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.420
Bender, it's a simulation.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.380
Cool. What's the mission?

09:21.420 --> 09:22.540
Protect Captain Squishy.

09:22.580 --> 09:23.580
We need a plan to hold these guys off...

09:23.620 --> 09:25.060
until I get him out of here.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.180
Hey, Bender, are you scared?

09:26.220 --> 09:27.460
-No.
-Me, neither.

09:28.620 --> 09:30.300
You're doing good, Banks.

09:30.340 --> 09:33.140
Any sign of Diaz, Oscar three-zero?

10:04.940 --> 10:06.020
Come on!

10:07.060 --> 10:08.100
The enemy's been contained, sir.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.140
You're out of here.

10:10.220 --> 10:12.660
What about the other chopper?

10:12.700 --> 10:13.620
I'll take care of it.

10:13.660 --> 10:15.300
Good work, Banks!

10:18.460 --> 10:21.140
Looks like Diaz has taken
tiger five-seven, sir.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.340
Stop Diaz from getting away.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.700
Yes, sir.

10:31.620 --> 10:32.780
I'm going up after him.

10:43.980 --> 10:44.980
Diaz is getting away!

10:45.020 --> 10:46.820
I repeat, Diaz is getting away!

10:46.860 --> 10:48.260
I've got a problem here, sir.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.220
Way to go, Cody!

11:06.140 --> 11:07.620
Ryan, get out of there!

11:18.700 --> 11:19.740
Thanks, Cody.

11:23.260 --> 11:26.620
Target away. Repeat, target away.

11:26.660 --> 11:28.260
Over.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.860
Come on, let's go!

11:41.900 --> 11:44.900
So, Banks...

11:44.940 --> 11:46.020
you let him get away.

11:46.060 --> 11:49.140
Diaz? By now he's a long way from here.

11:49.180 --> 11:50.220
And by the look of things,

11:50.260 --> 11:53.220
I'd say I just beat your
little getaway simulation.

11:53.260 --> 11:54.740
Getaway simulation?

11:54.780 --> 11:56.460
That was no simulation.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.900
That was the real deal!

11:59.180 --> 12:00.580
Follow me.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.780
Wait. I don't
understand--

12:01.820 --> 12:02.740
Follow me.

12:02.780 --> 12:03.900
It was
just--

12:05.340 --> 12:06.420
This is crazy.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.300
What's Diaz have to do with this?

12:09.540 --> 12:12.820
Look, the ClA maintains a
secret storage facility...

12:12.860 --> 12:14.020
underneath the camp.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.060
That's impossible.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.460
Kids have been snooping
around this place for years.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.340
Somebody would've found
the entrance by now.

12:20.380 --> 12:21.460
That's why we put it...

12:22.660 --> 12:25.140
where no one wants to
spend too much time.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.820
Sir, I really am sorry...

13:05.860 --> 13:07.700
for letting Diaz get away like that.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.180
What is all this stuff?

13:09.220 --> 13:12.100
Stolen technology, weapons,
obsolete inventions.

13:12.140 --> 13:13.220
Wait a second.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.380
Are you telling me that the
ClA was behind Beanie Babies?

13:15.420 --> 13:16.340
Be careful!

13:16.380 --> 13:17.820
These are no ordinary Beanie Babies.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.020
Watch.

13:24.140 --> 13:25.860
Maybe they are ordinary
Beanie Babies. Come on.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.260
So what does Diaz have
to do with all this stuff?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.100
Run program.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.580
Ten months ago, Victor
Diaz was in charge...

13:34.620 --> 13:36.260
of a ClA mind control program...

13:36.300 --> 13:38.340
designed to help with human learning.

13:38.380 --> 13:41.140
Diaz, however, was more
interested in developing it...

13:41.180 --> 13:42.980
to control people's
minds in a bad way...

13:43.020 --> 13:44.860
and we decided to abort the program.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.260
Diaz took the decision pretty bad...

13:47.340 --> 13:49.860
and it looks like he just
struck back at the organization.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.540
Now freeze image.

13:52.300 --> 13:55.140
Diaz just stole the
mind control software.

13:55.180 --> 13:57.380
The global implications of
this theft are enormous...

13:58.380 --> 14:02.660
and our government wants
these disks back in safe hands.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.580
You gotta let me bring him back.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.180
I knew you wouldn't let me down, Banks.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.260
Be ready to leave by 0600.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.225
What happened to you?

14:29.260 --> 14:31.460
I don't wanna talk about it.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.660
Anyway, listen.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.060
Your mission cover will involve you...

14:34.100 --> 14:35.540
attending a summer music academy.

14:35.580 --> 14:36.820
More school?

14:36.860 --> 14:37.940
Just once in my life...

14:37.980 --> 14:39.620
I'd like a mission that
doesn't involve homework.

14:39.660 --> 14:42.340
Wait. Did you say music?

14:42.380 --> 14:44.060
It's a good thing you play the clarinet.

14:44.100 --> 14:47.780
Yeah. Wait! I don't play the clarinet.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.100
Your file says you were in the
school band for three years.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.580
I faked playing the
clarinet to meet girls.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.260
You joined the marching
band to meet girls?

14:55.300 --> 14:56.340
Yeah.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.705
Well, you faked it for three years.

14:57.740 --> 14:59.460
You can handle it for
another couple of weeks.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.420
You'll be part of an
international youth orchestra.

15:01.455 --> 15:03.540
An international youth orchestra?

15:03.580 --> 15:04.540
Where?

15:05.420 --> 15:08.060
London

15:08.100 --> 15:10.500
Destination London

15:11.980 --> 15:14.380
London

15:14.420 --> 15:16.420
Destination London

15:19.100 --> 15:21.820
Secret agent on a deadly mission

15:21.860 --> 15:22.980
Girls are in town

15:23.020 --> 15:24.980
And he doesn't wanna miss 'em

15:25.020 --> 15:26.180
London, London

15:26.220 --> 15:28.180
The dog's on the run

15:28.220 --> 15:29.700
Lurking undercover

15:29.740 --> 15:31.700
He'll get the job done

15:33.020 --> 15:34.420
London

15:34.540 --> 15:35.700
What the heck do you think you're doing?

15:35.740 --> 15:36.820
Hey, man.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.020
It's called the double-bluff.

15:38.060 --> 15:39.540
No way in the world
somebody's gonna think...

15:39.580 --> 15:41.340
a kid like you works for the ClA.

15:42.860 --> 15:43.940
You're fourteen!

15:43.980 --> 15:45.060
I'm sixteen!

15:45.100 --> 15:47.300
Well, act your age and loosen
up a little bit, all right, man?

15:47.340 --> 15:48.580
Who are you?

15:48.620 --> 15:50.660
Derek Bowman. I'm your handler.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.540
OK. Double cheeseburger,
hold the pickle...

15:53.580 --> 15:57.020
easy on the mustard, no mayo, ayo, ayo.

15:57.060 --> 15:58.180
Are you kidding?

15:58.220 --> 15:59.580
Come on, just say the code.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.500
Chicken sandwich with everything...

16:01.540 --> 16:03.060
a-ling,
a-ling, a-ling.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.940
Thank you, but I don't need a handler.

16:05.980 --> 16:09.620
Hey, I don't need a white
Mini-me, but here we are.

16:09.660 --> 16:11.580
Cody Banks.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.340
Voila.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.700
All right. Here we go.

16:25.740 --> 16:27.540
State of the art field unit.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.500
Designed it myself.

16:29.540 --> 16:32.740
Gucci interior, plasma flatscreen...

16:34.300 --> 16:36.380
DVD, surround sound...

16:38.300 --> 16:41.300
G.P.S., wireless ethernet.

16:41.340 --> 16:42.340
Check it out.

16:43.740 --> 16:46.300
And riding shotgun, my
right-hand man Kumar.

16:46.340 --> 16:48.100
All right, Mr. Banks?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.860
He is a bit young, isn't he, sir?

16:50.940 --> 16:51.980
And to top
it off--

16:52.780 --> 16:54.540
I got the baddest
system in all of London.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.260
Turn it down!

17:03.180 --> 17:05.619
Oh! It's half past two.

17:06.700 --> 17:07.619
What?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.060
Of course, every time
you turn that on...

17:09.099 --> 17:10.380
you risk blowing your cover...

17:10.420 --> 17:12.140
and putting yourself and
all your men in danger.

17:14.180 --> 17:16.579
You know what your problem is, Banks?

17:16.619 --> 17:18.339
You're too darned old, man.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.740
Act like a kid.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.300
That's why they recruited you.

17:21.339 --> 17:24.540
And besides, it's more fun anyway.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.260
That's the Concorde right there.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.380
There it is, over there.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.020
There's the Houses of Parliament.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.900
That's Big Ben.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.540
Check this out.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.420
You don't have anyone
checking up on you?

17:54.380 --> 17:55.900
Nope.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.620
So, basically, you just
roam around London...

17:57.660 --> 17:59.060
as completely free agents?

17:59.100 --> 18:01.140
That's right.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.500
Sounds to me like you've
been dropped off the map.

18:04.940 --> 18:06.260
All right, look, man.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.140
I screwed up on another mission...

18:08.180 --> 18:09.780
and they sent me to
this little backwater...

18:09.820 --> 18:11.500
to teach me a lesson, all right?

18:11.540 --> 18:13.780
Here, what are you
calling a little backwater?

18:13.820 --> 18:14.860
Stick with me, Bowman.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.260
I might be able to get you back home.

18:17.780 --> 18:19.300
Check it out.

18:21.580 --> 18:23.820
"G7 world leaders summit to
be held at Buckingham Palace"?

18:23.860 --> 18:24.940
What does this
have to do--

18:24.980 --> 18:25.940
Next page.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.860
"Lord Duncan Kenworth to
expand Research Program."

18:30.895 --> 18:32.580
File the kid up, Kumar.

18:34.220 --> 18:36.420
Your entry target is
Lord Duncan Kenworth...

18:36.460 --> 18:38.940
brilliant scientist,
and greedy as a rat.

18:38.980 --> 18:41.540
You think Diaz and this Kenworth
dude are working together?

18:41.580 --> 18:43.460
One of the only
scientists able to make...

18:43.500 --> 18:46.740
the mind control software
work: Lord Kenworth.

18:46.780 --> 18:49.060
I'll bet that Diaz is
already in London...

18:49.100 --> 18:50.660
and it's no coincidence
that he's here...

18:50.700 --> 18:52.585
the same week as all
these world leaders.

18:52.620 --> 18:54.940
You put these two
zip-a-dee-doo-dahs together...

18:54.980 --> 18:57.340
and we have a nightmare
waiting to happen.

18:57.380 --> 19:01.180
Mind control is reality,
and God help us all.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.820
Kenworth's married to
Lady Josephine Kenworth...

19:02.860 --> 19:04.260
who runs a summer music program...

19:04.300 --> 19:06.020
at the Westminster Music Academy.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.060
You'll be staying with eleven other...

19:07.100 --> 19:09.660
international musical
geniuses at their posh estate.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.620
Musical geniuses?

19:11.660 --> 19:13.060
I think I'm gonna be sick.

19:14.660 --> 19:16.700
I don't mean to throw a
wrench into things here...

19:16.740 --> 19:19.180
but we may have a problem.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.660
Hey, your problem is our problem, man.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.260
What's up?

19:23.300 --> 19:25.380
I don't really play the clarinet.

19:25.420 --> 19:26.540
But that's not a big deal, right?

19:29.580 --> 19:32.980
Man, those musical geeks,
they're gonna eat you alive.

19:33.020 --> 19:34.100
No pressure.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.860
Get your tickets here!

19:36.900 --> 19:38.500
What are we doing here?

19:38.540 --> 19:40.900
I got somebody I want you to meet.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.180
Follow me.

19:42.220 --> 19:45.420
All aboard the Ripper Ride!

19:45.460 --> 19:47.700
Don't be scared, Cody.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.860
All aboard the Ripper Ride!

19:49.900 --> 19:51.460
Hey, you get in the back, Kumar.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.580
OK, Guv.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.020
You sure this thing can
take your weight, Bowman?

19:54.060 --> 19:57.220
All aboard the Ripper Ride.

20:06.380 --> 20:10.140
This place is like Disneyworld,
except for serial killers.

20:10.220 --> 20:13.420
Hey, check it out.
Jack the Ripper? Please.

20:13.460 --> 20:16.060
Freddy Krueger, now that's
what I call a killer.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.900
We're going in there.

20:20.780 --> 20:22.940
Are we on a mission here or a vacation?

20:22.980 --> 20:24.940
Hey, look here.

20:24.980 --> 20:28.540
All work and no play
makes Jack a very dull boy.

20:28.580 --> 20:30.460
My name's Cody, not Jack.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.100
Aw, Cool.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.340
Oh, no, it's perfectly all right.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.220
Not to worry, it was broken already.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.860
Well, I'm afraid not
quite to that extent.

20:46.860 --> 20:49.260
Cody Banks, Neville Trubshaw.

20:49.295 --> 20:50.260
How ya doin'?

20:50.300 --> 20:51.740
He works here.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.740
Actually, it's just a front.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.100
He's one of us.

20:57.020 --> 20:59.580
Hey, Nev, got a goodie
bag for my man here?

20:59.620 --> 21:01.380
Well, let me see.

21:01.420 --> 21:04.700
I think I have a few
items could prove useful.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.900
Mentos?

21:14.940 --> 21:18.500
Yes. A minty-based
breath snack candy...

21:18.540 --> 21:22.500
which doubles as a
small explosive device.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.780
Just lick, stick...

21:30.940 --> 21:32.420
It'll do the trick.

21:35.740 --> 21:38.340
Unfortunately, if you
accidentally eat one...

21:42.780 --> 21:44.180
you'll be sipping your
dinner through a straw...

21:44.220 --> 21:45.460
at the very least.

21:47.820 --> 21:50.500
Pay attention, Banks. What's that?

21:52.340 --> 21:54.780
It's a standard issue travel bag?

21:54.820 --> 21:55.900
Or is it?

21:57.100 --> 21:59.260
Oh, cool!

21:59.300 --> 22:01.180
Recognize this?

22:01.220 --> 22:05.620
We've turned your retainer into
a personal listening device...

22:05.660 --> 22:08.220
with acute directional capabilities.

22:09.180 --> 22:12.620
Now, you manipulate the range, volume...

22:12.660 --> 22:15.780
and intensity using your tongue.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.820
Good. It seems to be working.

22:25.420 --> 22:26.980
Well, I never.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.260
It's a normal ballpoint pen.

22:31.300 --> 22:35.260
Except I've embedded a
high-tension microcable...

22:35.300 --> 22:36.580
within its body.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.700
So simply pop the highly recognizable...

22:40.740 --> 22:44.420
designer logo,
aim, and--

22:45.420 --> 22:46.380
Fire.

22:46.415 --> 22:47.305
Exactly.

22:47.340 --> 22:49.340
No, No. I mean fire.

22:52.780 --> 22:55.420
Pretty colors! Pretty colors!

22:57.900 --> 22:59.460
Right.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.500
Clarinet.

23:02.980 --> 23:04.740
I already have a clarinet.

23:04.780 --> 23:07.540
This is your new
clarinet then, isn't it?

23:10.740 --> 23:13.700
Kumar's gonna take you to
the Kenworth estate, OK?

23:13.740 --> 23:15.780
So I guess this is good-bye.

23:17.220 --> 23:20.860
A little hot still.
It's OK. Don't worry.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.340
You're not gonna be able
to get rid of me that easy.

23:23.380 --> 23:25.460
I'll be around.

23:27.060 --> 23:28.540
Agent Banks?

23:29.700 --> 23:32.780
Don't forget your yo-yo.

23:38.060 --> 23:40.260
How come I get a
retainer and a clarinet...

23:40.300 --> 23:42.060
and James Bond gets an Aston Martin?

23:42.100 --> 23:44.940
All in good time, Double-0 Junior.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.940
Carry on, my little doves.

23:54.020 --> 23:57.220
Hey, Cody, don't forget your clarinet.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.220
Good luck, mate.

23:58.255 --> 23:59.460
Thanks.

24:04.620 --> 24:06.940
Our American protégé
has finally arrived.

24:06.980 --> 24:09.540
Cody Banks, I presume.
Welcome to England.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.700
Trival? Oh, do hurry up, Trival.

24:11.740 --> 24:12.660
We've got company.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.620
I would've picked you up
from the airport myself...

24:14.700 --> 24:15.620
but I forgot.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.220
I took some cold medicine an hour ago...

24:17.260 --> 24:19.220
and I'm completely pickled.

24:19.260 --> 24:22.620
May I take your bags, young sir?

24:22.660 --> 24:24.500
Oh. Oh, sure.

24:24.540 --> 24:26.340
Thank you, sir.

24:30.980 --> 24:33.380
No, Trival. This way.

24:33.420 --> 24:36.740
Of course, ma'am. How silly of me.

24:36.780 --> 24:39.740
Inside to the house. Inside.

24:41.260 --> 24:43.060
Now I'm sure you're
just dying to meet...

24:43.100 --> 24:44.180
the rest of the students.

24:44.220 --> 24:45.140
Just dying.

24:45.180 --> 24:48.460
Inside to the house. Inside.

24:49.740 --> 24:51.180
Darling, meet our new arrival.

24:51.215 --> 24:52.780
Charmed, I'm sure.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.980
This is my husband Duncan.

24:55.020 --> 24:56.260
Cody. Clarinet.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.580
You don't look like a clarinet.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.220
See you later.

25:01.260 --> 25:02.500
Marvelous.

25:09.260 --> 25:10.260
All right, everyone.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.380
Let me introduce you
to your fellow virtuoso.

25:12.420 --> 25:14.780
All the way from the
United States of America...

25:14.820 --> 25:16.060
Cody Banks.

25:18.660 --> 25:20.060
Now, I'm sure you've got a
lot you wanna chat about...

25:20.140 --> 25:22.380
so I'll leave you to just mingle.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.820
Don't be shy.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.500
Emily Sommers, flute.

25:26.540 --> 25:28.060
What do you play?

25:28.100 --> 25:30.020
Basketball. A little baseball.

25:31.420 --> 25:34.300
Yes, but what instrument do you play?

25:34.380 --> 25:37.700
Oh! Oh. The clarinet.

25:38.860 --> 25:40.900
You are clarinet! I am bassoon!

25:40.940 --> 25:42.660
We are woodwind buddies.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.900
Clarinet? Good.

25:44.940 --> 25:46.540
Lots of money in the clarinet.

25:46.580 --> 25:49.540
Johan Berkhamp, double bass. Peace.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.140
All right. Don't mind me.

25:54.180 --> 25:56.580
You can carry on with your rehearsal.

25:56.620 --> 25:57.620
Just pretend I'm not here.

25:57.660 --> 25:59.700
Would you like a Mentos?

25:59.740 --> 26:01.300
No.

26:01.340 --> 26:02.620
I
mean--

26:15.500 --> 26:17.660
Fire in the hole!

26:25.700 --> 26:27.580
Just pretend he isn't here.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.580
Hey, woodwind buddy!
Come sit next to me!

27:01.980 --> 27:03.900
Britney Spears.

27:03.980 --> 27:05.540
She's the bomb, is she not?

27:05.580 --> 27:06.980
I guess.

27:07.020 --> 27:09.220
So, Cody, tell us when
your musical talents...

27:09.260 --> 27:10.660
were first discovered.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.700
Pretty recently, actually.

27:12.740 --> 27:15.620
Now, children, I have some
wonderful news for you.

27:15.660 --> 27:18.620
The lnternational Summit
on Children's Rights...

27:18.660 --> 27:20.740
will conclude on Saturday
at Buckingham Palace.

27:20.780 --> 27:22.620
And guess what youth orchestra...

27:22.660 --> 27:24.260
will be playing for Her
Majesty Queen Elizabeth?

27:24.300 --> 27:25.380
Our orchestra.

27:25.420 --> 27:27.740
Exactly.

27:27.780 --> 27:28.820
Did you hear the good news, darling?

27:28.860 --> 27:30.180
We're playing at the palace.

27:30.220 --> 27:32.740
How marvelous. What's for dinner?

27:32.780 --> 27:35.580
I went to the trouble of
hiring a virtuoso chef...

27:35.620 --> 27:38.340
to cook for our musical
creme de la creme.

27:40.020 --> 27:41.940
Voila!

27:41.980 --> 27:43.900
Sorry.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.740
Uh, now, where were we?

27:47.780 --> 27:49.500
I think Cody was about to tell us...

27:49.540 --> 27:51.180
about his fear of mint candy.

27:53.220 --> 27:54.940
No, I wasn't.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.540
There you go.

27:58.980 --> 28:02.460
This food looks absolutely revolting.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.580
What's wrong with it?

28:03.620 --> 28:05.860
What's wrong with it?
What the blue blazes is it?

28:05.900 --> 28:08.620
It's catfish and grits
the way my mama makes it.

28:08.660 --> 28:10.580
And over there, we got some corn bread.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.260
And, mmm, it's good.

28:12.300 --> 28:15.740
I say, do I detect
another American accent?

28:15.780 --> 28:17.100
Well, yes, you do, ma'am.

28:17.140 --> 28:19.140
I just recently graduated
from the pastry program...

28:19.180 --> 28:20.900
at Compton Community College.

28:20.940 --> 28:21.860
What are you doing?

28:21.900 --> 28:25.540
Because in America, if a dish
is particularly delicious...

28:25.580 --> 28:27.900
we like to say that it's
straight out of Compton.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.220
It's mine.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.380
Hello?

28:45.940 --> 28:48.980
I've decided to bring
our meeting forward.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.180
What do you mean?

28:53.220 --> 28:54.300
You're where?

28:54.340 --> 28:56.220
Well, how
did you--

28:56.260 --> 28:58.460
Don't touch anything. I'm coming.

28:59.620 --> 29:00.820
Excuse me.

29:02.060 --> 29:03.100
What's for pudding?

29:04.100 --> 29:05.700
What's for what?

29:05.740 --> 29:07.380
Well, pudding.

29:07.420 --> 29:08.860
I think he means dessert.

29:12.060 --> 29:13.060
Chocolate...

29:14.660 --> 29:16.260
surprise.

29:20.140 --> 29:22.140
I need to get a clean knife.

29:22.180 --> 29:23.100
Excuse me.

29:23.140 --> 29:24.900
Chocolate surprise?

29:24.940 --> 29:26.980
How the heck am I gonna do this?

29:27.020 --> 29:27.940
Chocolate surprise.

29:27.980 --> 29:29.860
Derek, what are you doing?!

29:29.900 --> 29:31.180
And what's chocolate surprise?!

29:33.100 --> 29:34.180
I need more chocolate.

29:37.820 --> 29:38.820
My personal supplies!

29:41.060 --> 29:42.340
I think Diaz could be here.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.785
What?!

29:43.820 --> 29:45.060
I need you to cover for me.

29:46.540 --> 29:48.180
Rule
numero uno--

29:50.540 --> 29:52.540
be careful.

29:52.580 --> 29:54.380
Ooh, this is gonna be good.

29:54.420 --> 29:55.620
Mmm! This look good.

30:10.700 --> 30:14.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
chocolate surprise.

30:14.140 --> 30:16.620
Mmm. Look at that.

30:16.660 --> 30:18.020
That's colorful.

30:18.060 --> 30:21.340
What's in that, exactly?

30:23.180 --> 30:24.900
Lovely jubbly.

30:24.940 --> 30:26.020
Delicious.

30:26.860 --> 30:29.060
This really is straight out of Compton.

30:31.820 --> 30:33.060
Thank you.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.420
Where did Cody disappear to?

30:36.460 --> 30:38.620
Oh. He said he had to go rehearse.

30:38.660 --> 30:40.820
Oh, that is such dedication.

31:16.060 --> 31:17.980
What was that?

31:25.940 --> 31:27.860
I thought I told you not to come here.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.180
It's too risky.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.540
Doctor...

31:32.100 --> 31:34.180
twenty years in the ClA...

31:34.220 --> 31:36.500
nobody gets to see me
unless I wanna be seen.

31:38.180 --> 31:39.220
Are you out of your mind?

31:39.260 --> 31:40.700
It's very dangerous for me.

31:40.740 --> 31:42.660
All right, you're here.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.860
Now, what do you want?

31:46.140 --> 31:47.540
What do I want?

31:48.860 --> 31:50.940
I wanna know what's going on.

31:54.860 --> 31:57.860
I wanna know why I haven't
heard a peep out of you...

31:57.900 --> 31:59.820
since I sent you the first prototype.

32:04.780 --> 32:07.140
Please. That's over
three thousand years old.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.260
So you couldn't afford a new one?

32:15.820 --> 32:19.260
Look, let me put this in
terms you'll understand.

32:19.300 --> 32:23.380
Your software is worthless without me...

32:23.420 --> 32:25.420
and until you give me the second disk...

32:25.460 --> 32:27.420
I can go no further with my research.

32:27.460 --> 32:30.820
Doctor, let me put it in
terms you can understand.

32:30.860 --> 32:32.340
I want proof that it works now!

32:32.380 --> 32:34.940
Oh, Victor, such fire.

32:34.980 --> 32:39.060
Your impatience will be your
undoing one of these days.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.380
Is that a threat?

32:40.420 --> 32:42.820
Threat? Good grief, no.

32:42.860 --> 32:46.140
Now, would you care for a
little drinky-winky, Victor?

33:11.820 --> 33:13.180
Thirsty dog.

33:36.620 --> 33:38.300
That's amazing.

33:40.940 --> 33:43.620
Wow. It works.

33:43.660 --> 33:44.700
It works?

33:44.740 --> 33:45.820
But will it work on humans?

33:45.860 --> 33:46.940
Very tricky.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.420
The human brain, present
company excepted...

33:49.460 --> 33:51.140
is much more sophisticated.

33:51.180 --> 33:53.065
If you want the American President...

33:53.100 --> 33:55.220
following your orders
like that performing dog...

33:55.260 --> 33:57.820
you'll hand over the other disk.

33:59.180 --> 34:00.260
Take it.

34:01.500 --> 34:05.380
But remember, Doctor,
if you ever cross me...

34:08.500 --> 34:10.460
I'll break a lot more than that vase.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.580
Carry on, Trival.

34:18.620 --> 34:19.580
Madam.

34:50.340 --> 34:51.260
Hi.

34:51.340 --> 34:53.060
May I just say, Cody Banks...

34:53.100 --> 34:54.820
your dedication has been noted. Bravo.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.340
Oh, thank you.

34:56.380 --> 34:58.780
As a former operatic protégé myself...

34:58.820 --> 35:02.020
I am fully aware of what it
takes to make it to the top.

35:02.060 --> 35:03.300
Really?

35:03.340 --> 35:05.820
I was a soprano, don't you know?

35:17.540 --> 35:19.740
Yes, I know I'm a little rusty.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.620
Anyway, carry on.

35:31.740 --> 35:36.340
Oh, you know what? I need a new reed.

35:37.780 --> 35:39.180
Adorable.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.860
Derek, wake up.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.785
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up. Hey.

35:59.820 --> 36:02.260
Hey, man, I been waiting
up half the night for you.

36:02.300 --> 36:03.460
Where have you been?

36:03.500 --> 36:05.380
It's hard to get around
without being seen.

36:05.420 --> 36:07.180
Listen, Diaz was just here.

36:07.220 --> 36:09.140
Is that a blanky?

36:09.180 --> 36:10.260
What?

36:10.300 --> 36:11.420
You sleep with a blanky?

36:11.460 --> 36:14.780
It's not a blanky. It's a handkerchief.

36:14.820 --> 36:17.540
Never mind. I saw Diaz.

36:17.580 --> 36:18.660
What?

36:18.700 --> 36:20.900
We were right. Kenworth's involved.

36:20.940 --> 36:23.620
And the mind-control thing,
it's definitely a thing.

36:23.660 --> 36:25.260
It works? How do you know?

36:25.300 --> 36:26.780
His dog was playing the piano.

36:26.860 --> 36:28.140
Well, is he any good?

36:34.020 --> 36:35.820
Not bad for a dog, man.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.420
I'm not gonna rush out and buy
the CD, but, you know, hey--

36:38.460 --> 36:39.540
Seriously.

36:39.580 --> 36:42.420
All right, look, I'll get that
info back to headquarters...

36:42.460 --> 36:43.780
and you get you some shut-eye.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.220
You got a rehearsal in the morning.

36:45.260 --> 36:46.300
Oh, I can't wait.

36:49.420 --> 36:50.660
How's the room you're staying in?

36:50.700 --> 36:52.900
About the same.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.660
All right.

36:56.700 --> 36:59.860
Blanky. Yeah, right.

37:26.020 --> 37:27.340
You snore.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.820
Justin Timberlake snores.

37:30.860 --> 37:32.420
I do not snore.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.420
Oh, yes, you do.

37:38.820 --> 37:40.420
You're a very strange girl.

37:40.460 --> 37:44.780
Oh, the cook said you would
probably try to skip class.

37:44.820 --> 37:46.340
So I was to make sure
you caught the bus...

37:46.380 --> 37:48.020
and didn't forget your clarinet.

37:48.060 --> 37:50.820
Thanks, woodwind buddy.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.300
You mind?

38:08.460 --> 38:10.420
Tally-ho!

38:18.820 --> 38:22.180
This lobster has to be
put in the lukewarm water.

38:22.220 --> 38:24.700
It sort of lulls it to sleep.

38:27.420 --> 38:29.020
And then, of course, it will die.

38:29.060 --> 38:30.900
Shrimps are done this way.

38:30.940 --> 38:32.300
Everything like that is done this way...

38:32.340 --> 38:33.340
Yeah?

38:33.380 --> 38:34.300
Hello, sir?

38:34.380 --> 38:36.740
Diaz has definitely made contact.

38:36.780 --> 38:37.980
Are you sure?

38:38.020 --> 38:39.020
Absolutely, sir.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.900
There's something big
going on in that lab.

38:42.540 --> 38:44.020
Hold on.

38:44.060 --> 38:46.140
Bowman.

38:49.100 --> 38:51.540
Uh, hello, sir?

38:51.580 --> 38:53.020
What the heck's going on over there?

38:53.060 --> 38:54.820
Nothing's going on, sir. It's just...

38:54.860 --> 38:57.820
bugs. These big castles
got big bugs, sir.

38:59.460 --> 39:03.740
Look, Bowman, Cody has
got to get into that lab.

39:03.820 --> 39:05.540
Way ahead of you, sir. Way ahead of you.

39:05.580 --> 39:06.900
No problem whatsoever.

39:06.940 --> 39:08.020
Bowman, what's that alarm?

39:08.060 --> 39:12.100
Alarm? What alarm, sir?
I don't hear nothin'.

39:12.140 --> 39:14.180
You must be talking on
that cheap cell-phone plan.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.540
Sir, this goes well...

39:18.420 --> 39:20.740
you think maybe I can
get back in the game?

39:43.020 --> 39:45.020
It's me. I spoke with the Director.

39:45.060 --> 39:47.260
Is there a reason you
risked blowing my cover?

39:47.300 --> 39:49.140
Look here, inch-high private eye...

39:49.180 --> 39:50.500
relax, man, all right?

39:50.540 --> 39:52.260
Let's just say I did some
snooping around and found...

39:52.300 --> 39:54.940
Diaz and Kenworth are running
a mind-control test at the lab.

39:54.980 --> 39:56.060
When are we going in?

39:56.100 --> 39:59.580
We have to be in and out during lunch.

39:59.620 --> 40:01.780
So you gotta find a
way to get out of there.

40:01.820 --> 40:03.420
One o'clock and don't be late.

40:03.460 --> 40:04.700
See you at one.

40:04.740 --> 40:06.340
So what's happening at one?

40:06.380 --> 40:07.580
Eye doctor.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.900
Really?

40:08.940 --> 40:10.980
What do you think about Duncan Kenworth?

40:11.020 --> 40:11.940
Weird guy, huh?

40:11.980 --> 40:13.700
Yeah, he is a little bit odd.

40:13.740 --> 40:16.380
Ever notice anything
weird around the house...

40:16.420 --> 40:17.940
people coming and
going at strange hours?

40:17.980 --> 40:19.420
The dog mowing the lawn?

40:19.500 --> 40:20.420
Anything?

40:20.460 --> 40:22.580
Can't say I have.

40:25.420 --> 40:26.820
So who's your favorite composer?

40:26.860 --> 40:29.220
My favorite?

40:29.260 --> 40:30.620
I mean, who's been
your most influential?

40:30.660 --> 40:31.940
Well, uh...

40:34.540 --> 40:36.940
Heinz. Yeah, Heinz.

40:36.980 --> 40:39.220
He's definitely been
my biggest influ-ence.

40:39.260 --> 40:42.140
Heinz? I don't think I've heard of him.

40:42.220 --> 40:43.780
What's his most notable work?

40:46.860 --> 40:50.220
That's so hard. He's written,
like, fifty-seven varieties.

40:50.260 --> 40:51.220
Varieties?

40:51.260 --> 40:52.660
I mean symphonies.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.940
Fifty-seven symphonies?
That is an incredible output.

40:55.980 --> 40:59.540
He was especially busy
during his "red" period.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.420
Hey there, doggie. Sit up.

41:05.460 --> 41:06.660
Hey, sit.

41:08.540 --> 41:09.660
Now tell me, man.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.180
Where does your evil
daddy keep the mind device?

41:12.220 --> 41:14.340
Where does the evil doctor keep it?

41:14.380 --> 41:16.420
Oh, you gonna lay
down? Oh, I can do that.

41:16.460 --> 41:17.940
Come play with me. Come on.

41:17.980 --> 41:20.580
Tell me. Ooh, don't pee on me.

41:20.620 --> 41:22.620
What the devil are you doing?

41:22.660 --> 41:25.820
Nothing. Just have a little
R&R with the dog, man.

41:25.860 --> 41:27.380
I love the animals. I grew up with 'em.

41:27.420 --> 41:28.380
Fascinating.

41:28.460 --> 41:31.660
Now leave my dog alone
and get back to work.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.340
And take your bum off my Bentley.

41:34.380 --> 41:36.740
Oh, sure. Yes, sir.

41:36.780 --> 41:37.820
Jackass.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.140
What did you say?

41:39.180 --> 41:42.820
Oh, I just said I have asthma.

41:42.860 --> 41:45.500
You know, there's a lot of
pollen in this London air.

41:45.540 --> 41:46.780
Jackass.

41:51.740 --> 41:53.460
You, boy, come here!

41:57.100 --> 42:00.060
Aren't you one of Lady
Kenworth's foreign Johnnies?

42:00.100 --> 42:02.460
Yes, sir. Johnny Foreigner on my way.

42:05.100 --> 42:07.540
Now listen here, Yankee Doodle Dandy.

42:07.580 --> 42:09.500
Musical genius or no musical genius...

42:09.540 --> 42:11.740
we will not tolerate
slacking in this academy.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.820
Are you receiving me loud and clear?

42:13.860 --> 42:16.180
Yes, sir, receiving you loud and clear.

42:16.220 --> 42:17.460
And don't answer me back, boy.

42:17.500 --> 42:18.500
You just
asked me--

42:18.540 --> 42:20.020
Period!

42:20.060 --> 42:21.300
As you say in America.

42:21.340 --> 42:23.740
Now haul some ass and
get to your class...

42:23.780 --> 42:25.140
before I have you expelled.

42:25.180 --> 42:26.860
Summer students.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.620
I'll have them all expelled.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.620
St. Paul's Cathedral, Kumar.

42:59.420 --> 43:02.780
OK, Cody, come in. 1, 2, 1, 2. Testing.

43:02.820 --> 43:03.900
I got it.

43:03.940 --> 43:04.860
Lovely.

43:14.980 --> 43:18.260
OK, Kumar, we're heading to
the east-side security entrance.

43:18.300 --> 43:20.580
I've got you.

43:20.620 --> 43:22.540
Not a bad view, eh?

43:23.580 --> 43:25.900
But it can be improved.

43:25.940 --> 43:27.785
When this is over...

43:27.820 --> 43:30.700
I intend to replace
stuffy, old St. Paul's...

43:30.740 --> 43:32.780
with a statue of myself.

43:37.180 --> 43:39.100
Rather marvelous, don't you think?

43:39.180 --> 43:41.380
What about you, Victor?

43:41.420 --> 43:43.580
I worked for the ClA for twenty years.

43:45.900 --> 43:48.780
And when the time came
to reward my efforts...

43:48.820 --> 43:52.820
I was humiliated, put
in charge of children...

43:52.860 --> 43:55.740
and a lesser man was given
my rightful job as Director.

43:59.340 --> 44:02.820
If this project of
yours works, Duncan...

44:03.780 --> 44:08.340
I'm gonna use it to bring
the entire organization...

44:08.380 --> 44:09.900
to its knees.

44:11.500 --> 44:12.700
Dr. Kenworth, sir.

44:14.900 --> 44:15.940
I think we're ready.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.340
Excellent.

44:19.340 --> 44:21.060
Cheers.

44:21.100 --> 44:22.820
Tally-ho.

44:22.940 --> 44:24.260
We're just here to get information...

44:24.300 --> 44:25.740
so don't blow your cover.

44:25.780 --> 44:27.260
OK, Agent Blanky.

44:27.300 --> 44:28.660
It was not a blanky.

44:28.700 --> 44:30.820
It was a big, red, fluffy blanket.

44:30.860 --> 44:31.780
It wasn't.

44:53.260 --> 44:57.740
Excuse me. Is this where
I drop off my fluids?

44:58.380 --> 44:59.660
What?

44:59.700 --> 45:03.220
My doctor--he told me
that I was supposed to...

45:03.260 --> 45:06.140
bring in my pee today.
So I just filled these up.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.300
What do you mean, doctor?

45:07.340 --> 45:09.980
My doctor. He said, "Go
on and bring your pee up--"

45:10.020 --> 45:12.060
I'm eating a sandwich.
Get those off my desk now.

45:12.100 --> 45:13.380
Sure. No problem. I got it.

45:16.140 --> 45:18.580
I'm sorry about that. My
bad, man. It's just pee.

45:18.620 --> 45:19.540
Out.

45:19.580 --> 45:20.620
I wouldn't touch that.

45:20.660 --> 45:22.420
My doctor said it could
be highly contaminated.

45:22.460 --> 45:23.420
Out.

45:26.060 --> 45:27.060
Wait a minute.

45:28.060 --> 45:29.060
Ain't this the hospital?

45:29.100 --> 45:31.900
No, this is not the
hospital. Now get out.

45:31.940 --> 45:33.780
Oh, brother, I'm sorry, man.

45:33.820 --> 45:35.940
I didn't mean to spill my
pee all over your jacket.

45:36.620 --> 45:38.140
I got a lot more where that came from.

45:38.180 --> 45:40.420
Keep the beakers, too, man.
They make good drinking glasses.

46:00.500 --> 46:01.980
He's in.

46:15.140 --> 46:19.300
Headed west towards the
boiler room on level one.

46:26.940 --> 46:29.220
Service elevator to the left.

46:35.340 --> 46:36.700
You got your chewing gum?

46:36.740 --> 46:38.340
Everything's cool.

46:42.340 --> 46:46.020
Finger-scan entry, and
you're home and dry.

47:06.700 --> 47:08.260
I'm in.

47:17.260 --> 47:19.100
Would Professor Black...

47:19.140 --> 47:22.460
please make his way to
the psychiatric laboratory.

47:38.420 --> 47:41.300
I am so excited.

47:43.420 --> 47:45.020
OK, I'm in position.

47:45.060 --> 47:46.180
10-4, good buddy.

47:46.220 --> 47:48.300
10-4, good buddy?

47:48.340 --> 47:49.460
What?

47:49.500 --> 47:51.260
Man, that is so "Convoy."

47:51.300 --> 47:52.420
Hey, guys, cut it out.

47:52.460 --> 47:54.500
There's something going
on in the lower lab.

47:54.540 --> 47:57.500
Thank you, Santiago. Begin the test.

47:57.980 --> 47:59.500
The blackout gas...

48:00.220 --> 48:04.220
Iasts long enough to clamp the jaw...

48:04.260 --> 48:08.940
and insert the microchip
into a cavity of my choice.

48:08.980 --> 48:10.460
What if the guy doesn't have a cavity?

48:10.540 --> 48:12.900
Then I make one.

48:12.940 --> 48:13.860
High five!

48:15.020 --> 48:16.420
It looks like they're working on...

48:16.460 --> 48:19.540
some sort of mental-dental
microchip thing.

48:19.580 --> 48:21.660
Basically, there's
enough transmitted data...

48:21.700 --> 48:23.900
in the microchip to relay
complex information...

48:23.940 --> 48:25.660
back from the brain...

48:25.700 --> 48:28.540
and into a simple
mobile operating system.

48:30.060 --> 48:31.420
Rather marvelous, don't you think?

48:31.460 --> 48:33.540
Rather marvelous.

48:33.580 --> 48:35.420
See for yourself.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.980
If you planted one
of these microchips...

48:38.060 --> 48:40.100
in your President, for instance...

48:40.140 --> 48:42.900
you could make him do
whatever you please.

48:42.940 --> 48:46.180
You could use him to create
absolute mayhem back home.

48:49.020 --> 48:53.060
Diaz, this could cause total chaos.

48:55.180 --> 48:56.700
I need to get a closer look.

49:00.860 --> 49:01.820
What the devil?

49:05.020 --> 49:07.300
We got a code red. I'm out of here.

49:08.620 --> 49:10.300
Kumar, the boy needs a back door, man.

49:10.340 --> 49:11.260
What we got?

49:13.500 --> 49:14.460
I got it.

49:14.500 --> 49:17.700
I need you in at the
number three elevator.

49:18.980 --> 49:20.420
That sounds easy.

49:20.460 --> 49:22.180
Shut down all elevators.

49:23.660 --> 49:25.700
Two floors up you've got an air duct.

49:27.580 --> 49:29.900
Cool yo-yo.

49:37.100 --> 49:38.660
OK, this could work.

49:40.460 --> 49:42.260
Reactivate elevator three.

49:49.540 --> 49:50.660
Jesus.

49:50.700 --> 49:54.500
Cody? We've got a twelve
second ETA on that elevator car.

49:55.740 --> 49:56.700
Ten...

49:57.900 --> 49:58.820
nine...

49:59.900 --> 50:01.460
-eight...
-Man, almost there.

50:01.500 --> 50:03.460
seven...six...

50:03.500 --> 50:05.140
Pull yourself through!

50:06.220 --> 50:07.620
I'm in.

50:08.660 --> 50:09.660
You're the man, Cody!

50:09.740 --> 50:11.460
You're the man, baby. We're on our way.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.660
Give it up, baby.

50:12.700 --> 50:13.940
Come on, my son!

50:14.380 --> 50:16.300
Bloomin' fire alarm.

50:22.860 --> 50:23.900
Slow down, you idiot!

50:24.100 --> 50:25.220
Sorry!

50:25.260 --> 50:26.900
Cody, have you made it
to the loading bay yet?

50:34.780 --> 50:35.900
We're almost there.

50:37.380 --> 50:38.900
White Kenworth truck, do you see it?

50:38.940 --> 50:40.100
I've got it.

50:43.980 --> 50:45.460
Move, you nutter!

50:45.500 --> 50:47.580
You oughta get your eyes tested, mate.

50:47.620 --> 50:48.540
Want my eyes tested, sunshine?

50:48.580 --> 50:49.860
Go on, shift!

50:49.900 --> 50:52.500
-Stupid idiot!
-On your way, go on!

50:53.580 --> 50:55.900
Not bad, huh? Mess with Derek Bowman?

50:55.940 --> 50:57.500
Not today, not today...

50:57.540 --> 50:58.820
not today!

50:58.860 --> 51:00.860
They were experimenting with
the mind control prototype.

51:00.900 --> 51:02.300
Have they got it to work yet?

51:02.340 --> 51:03.620
I don't know.

51:03.660 --> 51:04.700
Kumar, will you slow down?

51:05.700 --> 51:06.980
Are we being chased or something?

51:07.020 --> 51:09.460
No. Worse.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.380
You're late for class.

51:12.620 --> 51:14.380
Number four, sir.

51:14.420 --> 51:15.380
Wait a minute.

51:16.420 --> 51:18.500
Freeze it.

51:18.540 --> 51:21.060
My word.

51:21.100 --> 51:24.500
That's one of the musician
kids staying on the estate.

51:24.540 --> 51:25.500
Banks.

51:25.580 --> 51:27.620
Banks. You know him?

51:27.660 --> 51:29.540
I know he's no musician.

51:34.140 --> 51:35.860
See you later.

51:48.460 --> 51:50.180
Oh, yes, Mr. Banks.

51:50.220 --> 51:52.500
Our American clarinetist.

51:52.540 --> 51:55.780
We were just about to send
out a search party for you.

51:55.820 --> 51:57.300
Sir Jerkalot, I'm sorry...

51:58.500 --> 51:59.460
And you're honored to be in my presence.

51:59.500 --> 52:00.420
Indeed, thank you.

52:00.460 --> 52:02.900
Wasn't exactly where
I was going, but sure.

52:02.940 --> 52:03.940
Take your place. Hmm?

52:03.980 --> 52:05.900
So, back to the Mozart.

52:05.940 --> 52:07.260
Oh, no.

52:07.300 --> 52:08.700
"Oh, no" what?

52:08.740 --> 52:10.260
My instrument.

52:10.300 --> 52:11.460
I think it's been stolen.

52:11.500 --> 52:12.420
Hey, woodwind buddy...

52:12.460 --> 52:14.980
Iook what I found in
the trash can outside.

52:15.020 --> 52:16.220
Excellent.

52:16.260 --> 52:17.860
It would seem that
your musical career...

52:17.900 --> 52:19.105
has been miraculously revived.

52:19.140 --> 52:23.380
Now, please take your place
and we shall go from the top.

52:23.420 --> 52:26.500
A tempo, allegro molto.

52:26.540 --> 52:28.340
Sir Jerkalot?

52:28.380 --> 52:30.180
Would you indulge me
for one moment, please?

52:30.220 --> 52:32.380
Young Cody Banks is the only member...

52:32.420 --> 52:34.820
of my talented brood I've
yet to hear play a solo.

52:34.860 --> 52:36.580
Come to think of it...

52:36.620 --> 52:38.620
none of us have heard him play a solo.

52:38.700 --> 52:41.060
Hey, I'd hate to take up
valuable rehearsal time.

52:42.140 --> 52:44.060
Did you know you have
spinach in your teeth?

52:44.100 --> 52:46.060
Yes, I did, and I'm saving it for later.

52:46.100 --> 52:47.820
Now, please, play.

52:52.380 --> 52:53.700
OK, I have to remember something.

52:53.740 --> 52:54.820
Something had to sink in.

53:09.420 --> 53:10.660
Wow.

53:42.980 --> 53:44.580
Bravo.

53:48.140 --> 53:51.580
Dude...that did not at all suck.

53:51.620 --> 53:53.660
In fact, it was really rather good.

53:53.700 --> 53:54.620
Well, It's like a bicycle.

53:54.660 --> 53:55.900
You never really forget.

54:06.940 --> 54:07.940
Yes, thank you very much.

54:07.980 --> 54:09.380
You've made your point.

54:09.420 --> 54:12.260
Now if we may continue?

54:19.300 --> 54:21.100
Sorry, mate. I'm off-duty.

54:21.140 --> 54:22.620
What do you mean, off-duty?

54:22.660 --> 54:24.540
Hey, Grandpa, you invented the language.

54:24.580 --> 54:26.820
You'd think you'd understand.

54:26.855 --> 54:28.140
Bloody taxis.

54:35.380 --> 54:37.020
You go on without me.

54:37.060 --> 54:38.940
I'll get a cab back to the house later.

54:38.980 --> 54:40.220
Where are you going?

54:40.260 --> 54:43.100
I just remembered I have to
have tea with my grandmother.

54:43.140 --> 54:44.700
Your grandmother?

54:44.740 --> 54:46.460
Yeah. My great-grandmother.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.260
Great-granny Smith.

54:48.300 --> 54:49.820
Like the apple.

54:49.860 --> 54:51.260
Yeah. And I'm the apple of her eye.

54:51.300 --> 54:53.740
You won't be the apple
of Lady Kenworth's eye...

54:53.780 --> 54:55.460
if you're not back at
the house for dinner.

54:55.500 --> 54:56.900
All right. See you later.

54:59.020 --> 55:00.900
We've got company.

55:04.940 --> 55:05.980
I see him.

55:07.620 --> 55:09.500
Walk around the block. He'll follow you.

55:09.540 --> 55:11.780
We'll come in from the
back and box him in, OK?

55:11.820 --> 55:12.900
I got it.

55:13.340 --> 55:15.140
Hit it, Kumar!

55:33.540 --> 55:35.620
Hey! What's the rush?

55:56.300 --> 55:58.300
You idiot!

55:58.380 --> 56:00.340
Get out of my way!

56:04.300 --> 56:06.180
Wait! Hold on! Hold! Hold!

56:06.220 --> 56:08.220
Hey, stop the moped!

56:08.260 --> 56:10.500
-Agent Bowman, ClA.
-Jolly good.

56:10.540 --> 56:11.740
I need to commandeer this moped.

56:11.780 --> 56:13.060
Tough tiddly!

56:13.100 --> 56:14.660
Tough tiddly? Gimme the bike, man!

56:14.700 --> 56:17.060
Here's fifty p. Naff off
and buy yourself a doughnut!

56:17.100 --> 56:20.780
Look, man, I'll bring it
back with a full tank of gas!

56:22.380 --> 56:24.300
He stole my moped!

56:27.860 --> 56:29.260
Get outta the way!

57:01.300 --> 57:02.500
Move!

57:14.580 --> 57:16.140
Come on, get on!

57:26.060 --> 57:29.340
Jump!

57:35.820 --> 57:37.300
Oh, Shoot!

57:44.460 --> 57:45.980
Darn, that's some flashlight!

57:46.060 --> 57:48.660
You could have grown up
to be a fine agent, Banks!

57:48.695 --> 57:51.260
Hey, Diaz! You're never
gonna get away with this.

57:51.300 --> 57:52.385
Far from it, kid.

57:52.420 --> 57:54.700
The best they could
send after me is a boy...

57:54.740 --> 57:56.740
and an overweight agent
who's on probation?

57:56.780 --> 57:59.340
Hey! Who you calling
overweight, chrome dome?

58:00.300 --> 58:02.260
I am not...bald.

58:02.300 --> 58:04.700
That's a nice flashlight
you got there...

58:04.740 --> 58:06.500
baldie.

58:06.540 --> 58:09.260
Cody, one of us has to be a decoy.

58:10.380 --> 58:11.780
I volunteer.

58:11.820 --> 58:13.260
We need a plan!

58:44.660 --> 58:46.500
-Not bad.
-I had a good teacher.

58:46.540 --> 58:48.420
Too bad he was insane!

58:48.460 --> 58:50.780
You should have run
when you had the chance.

58:54.260 --> 58:56.740
You still got a lot to learn, kid.

59:19.380 --> 59:21.180
Armed police! Stay still!

59:21.220 --> 59:22.660
Do not move!

59:22.700 --> 59:24.900
Repeat: do not move!

59:42.100 --> 59:44.740
Tuck your shirt in.

59:50.260 --> 59:51.660
You know who I am?

59:54.540 --> 59:56.940
I'm your worst nightmare.

59:56.975 --> 59:59.340
A limey with a badge.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.740
What with a badge?

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.780
Who are you, Question Boy?

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.820
Who's Question Boy?

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.260
I'll do the questions, Question Boy.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.780
Question one--where did you
get this stolen credit card?

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.020
It's my dad's. He gave it
to me in case of emergencies.

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:12.260
Likely story.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.460
Your dad. What's that count for, then?

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.060
My father?

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.620
Listen...

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:22.020
this can go one of two
ways, you little Wally.

01:00:22.055 --> 01:00:24.380
Look, any second, that
phone is gonna ring.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.300
Oh, Right. You're psychic now, are you?

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.700
Yeah. That's it. I'm psychic.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.745
Any second now, that
phone's gonna ring...

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.620
you're gonna pick it up,
someone's gonna yell at you...

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.780
and then you're gonna
apologize and let me go.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.860
Right. Well, I'm feeling a
little bit psychic today...

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.300
and I say that that phone's...

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.860
not gonna ring.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.540
I say
you--

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.700
I think that's for you.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.380
Crescent. Yes.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.220
I'm interrogating him now.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.780
But it's going very well.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.580
He's about to crack.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.700
I can tell!

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:15.860
Right away. Of course.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.705
How did you do that?

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.340
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.100
I...

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.180
apologize.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:37.180
Mr. Banks for you, Miss.

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.700
Thank you, Crescent.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:42.180
You must have some friends
in very high places.

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.140
I, uh, guess I should thank you.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.740
You probably should.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.740
Emily?

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.585
You Americans!

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.180
You always think you're
one step ahead of the world.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.260
I've been on this case for months.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.540
You blunder in and almost
blow the whole thing...

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.020
in a matter of days!

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.860
"Covert Operations Officer"?

01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:06.620
Do you like Chinese food?

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:07.940
Sure.

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.940
A rickshaw in London?

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.540
Safe and economical.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.620
What did you expect...

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.020
Mary Poppins pulling a horse and cart?

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.220
Careful, it's spicy.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.020
So...how'd a nice girl like
you end up in Scotland Yard?

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.100
I have an extensive
martial arts background...

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.900
and I speak six languages,
including Japanese.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.340
How 'bout you?

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.620
I have an extensive
baseball card collection...

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.340
and I speak one language,
including English.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.540
No, I'm serious.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.780
I filled out a form for an
X-Men secret agent kit...

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.700
and two weeks later, I was
sworn in as a ClA operative.

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:52.580
Oh, right! So... why
are you actually here?

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.020
Why are you here?

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.300
I asked first.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.420
You're fishing.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:58.180
I don't fish.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.780
Well, we know Kenworth's
up to something.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.380
Tell me something I don't know.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:02.500
I guess that would be difficult.

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.420
Oh! Touché!

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:09.220
Look, if you need
my help on this--

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.380
Hey, I
don't--

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.420
Hey! Don't get your knickers in a twist!

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.580
You gonna help or not?

01:03:16.615 --> 01:03:18.340
I'll think about it.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.580
And my knickers are not in a twist.

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.900
Excuse me. Can you stop here, please?

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.420
Would you like a coffee?

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.740
Oh, no. I don't do coffee.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.860
But I'll take a soda.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.860
Thanks.

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.140
Our patient's awake.

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.420
Shall I begin?

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.300
Please. I'm looking forward to this.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.380
Poor, poor Mr. Banks.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.740
If only you'd stayed at
home where you belong.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.460
Well?

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.060
First...he's got a small cavity
I would like to take care of.

01:04:19.095 --> 01:04:22.620
I want you to implant him with
the microchip, you idiot...

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.340
not fix his cavities.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.500
Of course. Sorry.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.620
I'm sorry.

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.820
Put him under.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.740
Bye!

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:52.860
Good evening.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.220
Don't you mean morning?

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.620
Oh. Yeah. Morning.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.220
He's not responding quite correctly.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.740
For crying out loud, just
get him to make the call!

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:05.940
I am!

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.020
You get this thing
working now, understand?

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.700
This will
help, sir. 5-5--

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.500
Where the heck were you last night?

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.340
Yeah. You can say that again.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.220
Lady Kenworth was so worried,
she nearly called the police.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.540
I need to call the Director.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.500
The Director?

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.020
Uh, I think he meant to say...

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.140
conductor.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.100
Isn't that right, Mr. Banks?

01:05:28.135 --> 01:05:29.665
Conductor?

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.860
So why did he say...

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.140
Director?

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:37.980
Look, Frankenstein, even
a genius gets confused, OK?

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.900
But he definitely said Director.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:45.660
Hello?

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.300
-Banks, is that you?
-Affirmative.

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.940
We're in.

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.300
I need to meet with you, sir.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.180
Look, I just arrived in London
for a summit at the palace.

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.860
I know. The palace. The President.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.100
Top security.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.420
Piccadilly Circus. One hour.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:02.860
OK. Piccadilly Circus. One hour.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.420
And don't be late, OK, pal?

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:07.860
Are you OK?

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:13.820
Now...now we're in complete control.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.260
Who are you meeting at Piccadilly?

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.100
For a tutti fluti player...

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.860
you sure do ask a lot of questions.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.000
And for a Compton pastry chef...

01:06:21.035 --> 01:06:23.100
you seem to know a lot of answers.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.825
Mr. Banks...

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.540
I have that vegetarian recipe
cookbook that I promised you...

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:31.200
in the kitchen. Now!

01:06:31.235 --> 01:06:33.820
Beans on toast. Weird.

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.540
He's gone mad.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.140
You can say that again.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.620
Beans on toast.

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.140
Weird.

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.820
What's he doing? Stop!

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.780
What are you doing? Stop it!

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.940
Maybe I'm not so hungry.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.260
That's disgusting!

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:17.580
What the heck was all that about?

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.220
I think Cody's gone bonkers.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.300
Cody, what on earth
happened to you last night?

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:22.980
Good evening.

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.140
He means morning.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.500
Right this way, sir.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.940
Are you sure this is safe?

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:55.340
Oh, yeah. This is the
safest place in town.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.820
Ola. Have a nice trip.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.500
Oh, my gosh!

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.020
I know, it's fantastic, isn't it?

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.380
Let's go.
What the--

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.819
Man, are you trying
to scare me to death?

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:33.859
Let's go!

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:34.819
What did the Director say?

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:36.100
Nothing. Hit the gas!

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.140
Hit the
gas--please.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.300
OK, let's go!

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.620
What the heck is wrong with you people?

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.819
I know who you really are.

01:08:41.859 --> 01:08:44.060
I don't know what you're
talking about, Miss Tutti Fluti.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.740
Listen, I'm British intelligence.

01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:47.180
No, she's not.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.060
No wonder all the malls are empty.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.939
They got all you kids
workin' undercover!

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:52.140
I'm not a kid.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.300
Hit the gas, Kumar.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.620
Gotcha, Governor.

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:57.100
She's lying!

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.500
Look, we don't have much time.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.260
They implanted Cody with
a mind-control device...

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.460
and they just did the
same to your ClA Director.

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.300
-What?!
-Not true!

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.819
Well, take a look at this.

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:12.100
I don't believe it.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.540
Stop the car, now!

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.460
We have to get that
microchip out of him.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.500
No problem!

01:09:21.979 --> 01:09:23.020
There it is.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.540
OK, we need to get
a dentist or a--

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.660
We don't have time for that!

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.620
Fire in the hole!

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.380
Good thinking.

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.340
What, are you nuts?!

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.859
A whole Mentos can blow his head off!

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.700
OK, a thousand nanograms
equals one microgram.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.939
Do you know what you're doing?

01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:41.345
Hey! Never interrupt a brother...

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.939
when he's breaking down
the apothecaries' table.

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:45.220
The molecular weight is relative to...

01:09:45.255 --> 01:09:46.180
I got it!

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.580
I got it! Open his mouth!

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.540
Open it!

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.500
Oh, I can't look!

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.260
How'd you know how to do that?

01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.300
A great pastry chef knows
his measurements, baby.

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.500
Oh, he's coming through.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.900
You all right?

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.060
You OK?

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.140
My brain hurts.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.740
That's not gonna be the
only thing that hurts...

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.220
if we don't get to the Director in time.

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.820
Wait a minute.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:12.060
The meeting at the palace tonight.

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.980
Twelve leaders from twelve
countries all in the same place.

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:14.940
You don't
think--

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.860
Diaz is a psycho warmonger.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.660
If he gets control of any
of the world's leaders...

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.385
who knows what he'll have them do?

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:23.300
We need to call the FBl,
the Ml-5, the Men in Black.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.980
Diaz has the Director of
the ClA under his control.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.420
We may be already on
the most-wanted list.

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.625
So what are you saying?

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.580
I'm saying I hope you
brought your tuxedo.

01:10:32.615 --> 01:10:34.220
Oh, I got better than that.

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.540
Kumar...

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.220
take me to the crib.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:04.980
Nice dress, Derek.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:09.140
Hey! In Nigeria this is not a dress.

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.940
Actually...

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.540
it's called a bobo.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.060
That's right, player.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.780
Hey, let me tell
you something--

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:19.260
the ladies go loco for
a brother in a bobo.

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:39.460
Check that out.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.540
Do they do that in Russia?

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.780
Thank you very much.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.940
It's very good, yes.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.385
Here.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.340
Gordon Brown and l had
this marvelous idea...

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.780
Oh, Prime Minister.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:04.980
...of exporting sand to Jordan.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.180
Really.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:09.180
This is gonna be like
taking candy from a baby.

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.100
What next, Mr. Kenworth?

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.540
Let me see.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.100
How about making me
Director of the Royal Mint?

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.260
Consider it done.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:24.940
English, you idiot.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:26.420
Oopsy daisy.

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:31.900
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to propose a toast.

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:34.620
To Lord Duncan Kenworth...

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.980
the new Director of the Royal Mint.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.180
It's all working perfectly, Diaz.

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.380
Looks like the Prime
Minister has given Kenworth...

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.260
the keys to the Royal piggy bank.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.900
He's obviously under their control.

01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:51.340
Don't worry, Prime Minister,
the money's safe with me.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.820
Jolly good.

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.900
Now, about this sand business...

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.820
Darling, you're going
to run the Royal Mint.

01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.440
Bravo!

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:00.020
Thank you.

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:01.980
I'll soon be one of the
richest men in England...

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.540
which is why I'm leaving you.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.780
Leaving me?

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.220
This is turning out to
be a marvelous evening.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.580
We have to stop them.

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.180
-Come on.
-Let's go.

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.180
Oopsy daisy!

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:41.980
Move over.

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:48.420
And now for my ultimate prize.

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.225
The President of the United States.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.780
Soon you'll be under
my complete control.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:03.820
All the world's most
powerful men at my fingertips.

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.140
President to gift room.

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:10.460
Ah, good evening.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.420
The President wants to
see the Queen's gift room.

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.220
Ah, I'm afraid that
is not protocol, sir.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:15.180
Now you
listen to me--

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:16.220
All right, all right, keep your hair on.

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.460
Come on, follow me.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.740
John, good to see you.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.540
Sir...we thought it
might be a good idea...

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:23.580
for you to see the Queen's gift room.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.345
Relax, Guys. Just the President.

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.580
I've arranged for a
Presidential appointment.

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:28.540
Brilliant.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.060
There you are.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.700
What is the pastry chef doing here...

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.900
and why is he wearing a dress?

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:38.780
It's not a dress. It's a bobo.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.420
Thank you.

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.060
Now then,
everybody, l--

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.220
I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.700
I, uh...

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.140
I'm Habu's uncle...Compton.

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.460
-What?
-No.

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:54.100
I
mean--yes.

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.580
My favorite
uncle--Compton.

01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.020
Well, children, pay attention.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.620
I have just been informed that
this evening's performance...

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.540
must finish promptly at eight o'clock.

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:05.985
-What?
-Why?

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:08.140
Something about a 7-eleven summit.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.340
You mean G7?

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.460
Well, whatever.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.980
It's a very important meeting,
and it has to start at 8:00...

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.300
so...no dilly-dallying, all right?

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.220
We can't let that meeting happen.

01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:21.300
Kenworth and Diaz are
gonna use that meeting...

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:22.620
to take over the world.

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.580
What?

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.020
We have something to tell you.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.620
Cody, yo, yo.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.385
Need to know.

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.780
They need to know.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.820
Guys...

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.740
we're secret agents.

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.540
There you go.

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.660
Right!

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:40.860
And I'm Spider-man.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.300
And I'm Lara Croft.

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.620
And I'm Waheed Murad.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.340
Who?

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.620
Famous lndian actor.

01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:48.580
Right.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.380
Guys, I'm being serious.

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:51.820
You're funny, Cody Banks.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:56.420
Now, if you don't mind, we
have a concert to perform.

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.180
I believe you.

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.420
But what can we do?

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.145
Look, we can't let those leaders...

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:16.340
get out of that room
until we say it's safe.

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:19.020
Keep playing all night if you have to.

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.060
Here, play this.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.540
I can't play clarinet.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.620
You can play this one, Sabeen.

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:24.860
Come on, let's go.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.940
See you later, Uncle Compton.

01:16:27.975 --> 01:16:29.580
Habu.

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.260
Don't forget, just keep on playing.

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.060
Each year Her Majesty receives...

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.740
thousands of freebies
from around the globe.

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:43.260
Anything from a stuffed gazelle
to a rare croquet mallet...

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.340
presented by the last
Nawab of Pataudi...

01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:48.220
could end up in here.

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.945
Mr. President...

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.460
the Queen's gift room!

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.140
Wow.

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:02.060
I can't see the President.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.940
I can't see him either.

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.860
Something tells me
he's been checked in...

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.020
for a microchip root canal.

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.020
You guys check out
back, I'll go upstairs.

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.580
Let's go.

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.300
Your Royal Highnesses,

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.700
my Lords, ladies and gentlemen...

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.780
Lady Josephine Kenworth!

01:17:19.815 --> 01:17:21.500
Your Majesty...

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.100
esteemed guests...

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.740
I'd like to introduce you...

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.740
to a very special
international youth orchestra

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.740
Ied by our distinguished conductor...

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.020
Sir lsambard Jerkalot.

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.460
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:44.100
Mr. President?

01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.540
Hello?

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.220
Mr. President?

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.980
Where on earth is Cody Banks?

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.420
And Emily Sommers?

01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.180
Yes, where are they?

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.140
Derek? Where are you?

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:19.700
Hello?

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:22.500
Mr. President?

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:25.740
Bring it on, baldie.

01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:27.660
I am not bald.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:28.860
Yes, you is!

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.500
Wait! Don't be so rash.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:39.340
We can implant him and set
him on to his little pal Banks.

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.460
Better get back to the ballroom.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.060
Dude, I've been looking
all over for you.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:03.780
Oh, come on, Derek,
what-- What are you doing?

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:07.260
And, in the girlie golden
dress, Agent Bowman.

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:08.980
Terminate Cody Banks.

01:19:09.015 --> 01:19:10.660
Quit foolin' around.

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.740
We have to find the President.

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:14.020
Right hook. Left hook.

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.300
Again!

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.220
Come on, Derek.

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.620
-Spinny kick.
-Spinny kick?

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:20.700
You can't do a spinny kick.

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:24.860
Up you go.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.300
Bear hug!

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.540
Double kick. Hit.

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.740
Duck, you idiot.

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.420
Hit it!

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.140
A little old for video games, aren't we?

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:45.025
And you are too young...

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:48.740
to be snooping around past your bedtime.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.300
You know what I hate about dentists?

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.740
They always say something's
not gonna hurt...

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:04.740
and it does.

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.260
Me, I'm honest.

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.660
Now this is gonna hurt.

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.620
What's happening?

01:20:19.655 --> 01:20:20.777
You're back.

01:20:20.812 --> 01:20:21.900
Come on!

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.900
They had you under mind control.

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.140
You thought you were the Rock.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.140
I guess you're not back.

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.300
What's the password?

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.500
Mind control.

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:50.940
Yes, I know that already,
thank you very much.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.860
Now tell me the password!

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:56.100
Let's see if you can fly!

01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.140
No, Derek! Pull me back in!

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.140
I'll ask you one last time.

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:03.900
Mind control!

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:06.980
Oh! Mind control.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.540
Destroy Banks!

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.220
Please, please.

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.500
It's me, Cody.

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:17.500
Hey, little buddy.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.420
Your Majesty, put your clothes back on!

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.420
Now we're even.

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:26.660
Let's go find the President.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.860
What the heck you do that for?

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.980
Mind control.

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.185
That's your secret password.

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:36.180
I--I needed something
I could remember.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.700
Pathetic little man.

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.760
Pathetic?

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.780
Sir, wake up!

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.380
What? What's going on?

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.380
Emily Sommers, Special
Agent, Scotland Yard.

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.380
Sir, we stopped them
controlling your mind.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.145
Great. Terrific.

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.940
Great job, Agent Sommers.

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:55.020
Banks! Bowman!

01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.340
I've been looking for you.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.340
We've been looking for you, too, sir.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:04.940
What happened here?!

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.240
They've taken the President.

01:22:06.275 --> 01:22:07.500
Where are my prototypes?

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:09.345
Not there.

01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:10.700
Where are they?

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.060
I'm not telling you till you let me go.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.020
Where are my...

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:19.580
prototypes?

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:20.660
Idiot.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:22.940
It's where everybody
hides their backup disks.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.220
Where are you going?

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.180
I'm leaving.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:26.300
Without me?

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.100
Yeah. Without you.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.580
I think
l--

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.345
Oh, I got it!

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:35.580
Sorry, sir. Welcome back.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.340
You guys make sure the President's OK.

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:38.540
I'm gonna get Diaz.

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.020
What happened?

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.260
He hit you.

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:52.545
Bravo. Excellent.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:53.780
Excellent! Well done, everybody.

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.300
It's eight o'clock.

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.860
They're getting up to leave.

01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:57.820
Play something.

01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:59.260
Hey, Berkhamp...

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.060
we can't let them
start their G7 meeting.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:04.020
Improvise.

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.180
Hey, what are we doing?

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.620
Hey, Berkhamp, go for it, mate.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.740
War! Hunh!

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.300
What is it good for?

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:29.380
Absolutely nothing! Say it again now!

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.260
War! Hunh!

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:34.660
What is it good for?

01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:37.700
Absolutely nothing! Good God now!

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:38.980
Shout it!

01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:40.740
Huh! War!

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.460
Have you implanted the President yet?

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:50.460
What the devil's going on?

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.140
Go take a hike, Kenworth.

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:07.340
Turn yourself in, Diaz.

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.620
That's a good idea.

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:09.900
I've got an
even better one--

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:11.780
first I'll kill you, then I escape...

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.060
then I rule the world.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.660
So aggressive.

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.540
Wait! Don't!

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.740
That instrument is priceless!

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:49.060
Come on, Liz, let's get up.

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:22.940
Leaving so soon, sir?

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:23.900
Move, you idiot.

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:25.260
Very well, sir.

01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:58.060
Where are your friends now, huh, Cody?

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.540
Good student like you should take note.

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:03.180
You trusted. What a mistake!

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:06.340
Your friends are nowhere
when you're about to die!

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.940
Go and write that on your lunch box.

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.740
Danke. Danke very much.

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.140
And they said I was
too old to be a handler.

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:51.180
I'm fit as a fiddle, don't you know?

01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:52.420
Thank you, Agent Jenkins.

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.380
You haven't got a key to
the piggy bank after all...

01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.700
have you, Mr. Kenworth?

01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:57.660
Bog off.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.380
Is that my husband they're leading away?

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:02.140
Yes, I do believe it is, ma'am.

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.860
How absolutely marvelous.

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:07.540
Once again, excellent work, Banks.

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:09.580
I couldn't have done it
without my partners, sir.

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.380
They were all vital to the operation.

01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:12.380
Thank you all.

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.100
Well...

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:16.620
so long, Agent Banks.

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:17.985
I hope I have the pleasure...

01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:19.300
of working with you again one day.

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.820
Yeah. It was cool.

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:33.380
If you're ever in
Seattle, give me a call.

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:34.820
See you guys later.

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:36.580
See you on das flip side, Cody.

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:38.140
Good-bye, woodwind buddy.

01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.900
See you, woodwind buddy.

01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:40.860
Good-bye, Cody.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:41.820
Cheerio, Dude.

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:44.020
-Bye.
-Tally-ho, Banks.

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.900
Bye, Habu.

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:47.900
Good-bye, Uncle Compton.

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.180
-Bowman...
-Sir.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.940
I'm impressed.

01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:52.340
All in a day's work.

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.145
Tell me, uh...

01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:55.780
did you like working with Banks?

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:56.860
Are you kidding?

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:58.460
I love those mini agents, man.

01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:59.420
They're so cute.

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.740
You can just put 'em in your pocket.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:04.500
Bowman, you ever thought of relocating?

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:06.300
Well, actually, I thought about it, sir.

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:08.180
The food here in London's real weird.

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.220
You! Stop running!

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.540
You! Run faster!

01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.620
Yes, sir!

01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.260
Sorreson! Get here, front and center!

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:18.460
Go up in there and get
me a chocolate surprise.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.540
-Yes, sir.
-Hut, Hut, Hut!

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.380
Knees to elbows! Knees to elbows!

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.820
Hey, man, what can I do
to thank you for this?

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.180
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:30.980
Sir, I will see you next summer, sir.

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:35.940
Thanks, big man. All right.

01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:40.300
Isn't that your camp counselor?

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.020
I was dorm captain.

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:44.140
Oh,
dorm--

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.540
We're always so proud of you.

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.180
Oh, honey, we missed you so much.

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:49.260
Were you homesick?

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.060
Of course. Yeah.

01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:52.660
Come on, losers, get into gear.

01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:56.540
What's this?

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.940
Just a little something
for our little man.

01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:00.420
Wow!

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.740
This is cool.

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.380
It's got tweezers. I know.

01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.540
Well, your dad and l finally decided...

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:08.100
that you were old enough.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.340
Thanks, guys. It's great.

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.140
No fair!

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.020
Why does Cody get a knife?

01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:16.060
I want a knife. Mom!

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:17.380
Relax. I'll share it with you.

01:29:17.415 --> 01:29:18.460
Really?

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.900
Yeah. What's mine is yours.

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.340
Wow. Did you hear that?

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:23.980
Cody has to share everything with me.

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:25.140
No take-backs.

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:26.300
Well, he's a good brother.

01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:27.380
I always tell you that, Alex.

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.660
Does that mean I can eat...

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:30.900
half this whole pack of Mentos?

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:32.380
Don't just take stuff out of my pocket.

01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.940
You've been in the car for ten seconds.

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.100
Why you always gotta fight?

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.580
I'm gonna eat three.

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.780
No, Alex. Don't lick the Mentos.

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.340
There is a lot of candy talk in here.

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.420
He dropped it! Oh, I got it!

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.380
Open the window!

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:44.460
What are you doing, Cody?

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:45.500
Don't play with the window.

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.780
I don't like that.

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:51.420
Hey, did you see that?
