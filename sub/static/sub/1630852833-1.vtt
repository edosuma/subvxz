01:22.152 --> 01:23.122
Lainey.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.113
-Lainey.
-I'm coming, mama.

01:37.438 --> 01:38.651
Where have you been?

01:39.383 --> 01:42.676
I told you I need to see you
at all times, do you understand me?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.524
Yes.

01:44.608 --> 01:46.615
Mama, I got you an apple.
It's a good one.

01:47.514 --> 01:49.254
Come on. Get inside.

02:04.476 --> 02:06.933
I told you not to unlock this,
didn't you hear me?

02:07.699 --> 02:11.253
I have to pack up and I don't want you
running around up there all by yourself.

02:11.975 --> 02:14.435
And stop getting apples.
We don't need them.

02:15.322 --> 02:17.005
He can join his friends in there.

02:17.506 --> 02:19.699
Mommy, it was for you. Eat it.

02:22.858 --> 02:23.787
Fine.

02:26.150 --> 02:28.097
That's not the one.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.181
-This one?
-No.

02:35.367 --> 02:36.643
Are you kidding me?

02:43.663 --> 02:44.730
Okay.

02:47.043 --> 02:48.249
I'll get the baby.

02:48.346 --> 02:50.530
No, Lainey. I got him, you know the rules.

03:46.273 --> 03:47.833
Yes, ma'am.

03:53.882 --> 03:54.862
Yes, ma'am.

03:55.665 --> 03:58.750
Well, I'm gonna take off tonight,
so the kids gonna sleep most of the way.

04:05.140 --> 04:07.340
Well, I'm mostly done,
I just need to finish

04:08.054 --> 04:10.606
cleaning up the pantry
and pack up the rest to the car.

04:13.422 --> 04:14.862
Everything else is clean.

04:15.844 --> 04:16.678
Yes, ma'am.

04:17.204 --> 04:18.584
I did. Yes, ma'am.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.788
I already started looking
for job postings.

04:21.872 --> 04:24.541
So it won't be long
before I could start paying the rent.

04:25.277 --> 04:27.403
We really appreciate the help.

04:34.155 --> 04:35.702
Mommy.

04:40.337 --> 04:42.270
There is no chance of that happening.

04:43.843 --> 04:44.697
Mommy.

04:45.189 --> 04:47.556
I'm clean since rehab. I told you.

04:48.149 --> 04:50.276
Hush, baby, I'm on the phone
to auntie Claire.

04:53.911 --> 04:55.237
Do you want me to take a test?

05:00.022 --> 05:02.062
I just used my last minute, so…

05:02.624 --> 05:05.457
I will take a test
if that's what you need.

05:07.584 --> 05:08.437
Okay.

05:14.290 --> 05:15.456
Mommy.

05:17.431 --> 05:18.271
Come on!

05:18.355 --> 05:19.571
Mommy.

05:23.152 --> 05:23.992
Mommy!

05:24.076 --> 05:25.712
What do you need?

05:25.796 --> 05:26.879
I have to pee.

05:28.172 --> 05:31.238
Okay. Come on. Go to the bathroom.
Let's go. Come on.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.817
♪ A-B-C-D-E-F-G ♪

05:41.374 --> 05:44.257
♪ H-I-J-K-L-…P

05:44.341 --> 05:48.286
It's L-M-N-O-P, Lainey.

05:48.947 --> 05:49.827
Okay?

05:51.110 --> 05:52.343
Are you almost done?

05:53.169 --> 05:54.022
No.

05:54.581 --> 05:56.614
Well, can you hurry up, please?

05:57.280 --> 05:59.690
So much fun as it is to wipe your butt.

05:59.774 --> 06:01.274
I got other things to do.

06:07.707 --> 06:09.014
Keep practicing those ABC's.

06:10.559 --> 06:12.306
You almost got them perfect.

06:19.177 --> 06:20.504
Still leaking.

06:21.672 --> 06:22.672
Fuck.

06:22.756 --> 06:24.016
That's a bad word.

06:27.822 --> 06:28.942
You're right.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.181
I'm sorry.

06:32.265 --> 06:34.247
Nana said that it is the baddest word.

06:34.331 --> 06:35.697
Well, Nana's dead.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.457
I'm done.

06:45.444 --> 06:46.304
Well…

06:47.120 --> 06:48.433
Can be enough to get us there.**

06:53.536 --> 06:55.262
-Mama.
-What, baby?

06:55.346 --> 06:57.664
Daddy's dead like Nana?

07:12.173 --> 07:13.293
No, baby.

07:15.111 --> 07:16.256
Daddy's not dead.

07:16.767 --> 07:18.228
Nana said he's bad.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.645
No, baby. No.

07:22.331 --> 07:23.960
Daddy's not bad, okay?

07:24.462 --> 07:25.976
He's not bad. He's just…

07:26.769 --> 07:27.681
He's sick.

07:29.256 --> 07:30.938
Just like mama was sick.

07:31.461 --> 07:33.002
Mommy's not bad.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.056
But I got better.

07:40.254 --> 07:43.178
'Cause I love my little monkeys
too much to stay sick.

07:43.262 --> 07:44.661
I'm not a monkey. I'm a girl.

07:45.650 --> 07:46.670
No!

07:47.913 --> 07:50.840
You are a lovely little monkey.

08:21.371 --> 08:22.257
What's that?

08:22.341 --> 08:23.367
The rest of our food.

08:23.451 --> 08:24.765
We'll eat it during the trip.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.554
I got Animal Crackers in here.

08:27.644 --> 08:29.821
I don't wanna leave Nana's house.

08:29.905 --> 08:31.290
There's no jobs around here.

08:31.374 --> 08:33.140
And I don't have any money for Texas.

08:33.703 --> 08:35.346
Or anything else.

08:35.845 --> 08:37.566
I could sell apples for money.

08:40.633 --> 08:42.736
The apples are rotten, Lane.

10:33.687 --> 10:35.500
HOLY BIBLE

10:53.655 --> 10:55.106
Oh, shit!

11:00.294 --> 11:01.981
Lainey!

11:05.574 --> 11:07.328
Lainey, come here!

11:14.633 --> 11:16.300
<i>Where are my apples, mommy?</i>

11:16.384 --> 11:18.359
Lainey, listen…

11:19.358 --> 11:21.037
I need you to open the door.

11:21.537 --> 11:25.418
Okay? You just turn that little latch
real hard.

11:25.509 --> 11:28.274
And it's rusted a little bit,
so you need to use your muscles.

11:28.358 --> 11:29.938
<i>Mommy, where are my apples?</i>

11:31.073 --> 11:33.558
They're bad, Lane.
Please, just open the door.

11:34.018 --> 11:35.912
<i>Did you throw them outside?</i>

11:37.005 --> 11:39.578
Baby, we can pick more apples, okay?

11:40.790 --> 11:42.017
But mommy needs your help.

11:42.698 --> 11:43.684
Can you help me?

11:49.218 --> 11:52.131
It's hard to turn, so make sure
it's going the right way.

11:55.821 --> 11:57.342
<i>Are the apples sick?</i>

11:57.426 --> 12:00.012
They're bad, Lane.
They're not worth saving.

12:06.788 --> 12:07.774
Okay.

12:08.515 --> 12:09.775
Stay in back!

12:20.195 --> 12:21.188
Fuck.

12:52.623 --> 12:53.456
Lainey?

12:55.261 --> 12:56.708
Lainey, are you there?

12:56.792 --> 12:57.850
<i>Yes, mama.</i>

12:59.111 --> 13:00.765
Unlock the front door

13:02.129 --> 13:05.018
and go to the red box on the porch.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.152
Open it up

13:07.663 --> 13:11.354
and bring me a long metal tool.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.133
One that has kind of
a little X on the end.

13:15.707 --> 13:16.567
<i>A tool?</i>

13:17.238 --> 13:18.098
Yes.

13:18.963 --> 13:21.875
Just bring me what you can.

13:21.959 --> 13:24.858
The red box on the porch.

13:25.385 --> 13:27.139
Bring me anything from inside of it.

13:28.367 --> 13:29.847
-Okay, baby?
<i>-Okay.</i>

13:39.829 --> 13:41.536
<i>Here you go, mama.</i>

13:42.069 --> 13:43.482
Good job.

13:50.256 --> 13:54.714
Now try to get one
just like this but with an X, okay?

13:55.234 --> 13:56.068
<i>Okay.</i>

13:58.431 --> 13:59.612
Oh, God.

14:25.511 --> 14:26.471
Lainey?

14:27.382 --> 14:28.428
Did you find the tool?

14:29.034 --> 14:29.880
<i>Someone's here.</i>

14:30.520 --> 14:31.569
Who's here?

14:31.653 --> 14:33.397
<i>Daddy, he took the red box.</i>

14:37.699 --> 14:39.979
Is the front door locked like I told you?

14:40.063 --> 14:41.692
<i>Daddy's leaving.</i>

14:49.943 --> 14:53.622
Lainey, go outside and get him. Run.

15:01.605 --> 15:03.450
Got yourself locked in here again, Jess?

15:04.010 --> 15:05.559
Why I'm not surprised.

15:05.643 --> 15:06.496
Thanks.

15:07.598 --> 15:08.518
This is yours.

15:09.603 --> 15:10.436
Thanks.

15:13.833 --> 15:14.753
I'm just kidding.

15:15.353 --> 15:17.060
Calm down, Jess. Hey.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.046
You're hanging out with Sammy?

15:27.130 --> 15:28.812
I needed a place to stay.

15:46.194 --> 15:49.340
You could've stayed here if you'd passed
the drug test, you know that.

15:49.424 --> 15:52.359
Hey, small fry, you're so biggie.

15:52.973 --> 15:54.202
How old are you?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.680
-Lainey.
-I'm not a fry, I'm a girl.

15:56.764 --> 15:57.974
Lainey, come here.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.248
Come here, baby.

16:00.425 --> 16:02.018
Come on, let's go to the kitchen.

16:02.102 --> 16:03.836
Just go finish your sandwich, okay, baby?

16:03.920 --> 16:04.869
Hey, sweetie.

16:06.025 --> 16:08.498
You tracked dirt
all over the floor, dammit.

16:10.055 --> 16:10.909
Sorry.

16:17.391 --> 16:18.709
Where's the little guy?

16:19.234 --> 16:22.653
He's upstairs taking a nap
before the trip.

16:23.168 --> 16:24.262
I don't wanna wake him.

16:26.998 --> 16:27.838
So, Texas, huh?

16:29.091 --> 16:30.638
I can't afford to stay here.

16:31.154 --> 16:34.034
Can't afford it. Too expensive.

16:37.207 --> 16:39.084
Your grandma didn't leave anything?

16:40.648 --> 16:41.608
Like money.

16:42.893 --> 16:44.620
No. No, just the house.

16:47.748 --> 16:48.774
Look…

16:48.858 --> 16:49.993
You're both high.

16:50.498 --> 16:51.411
So you should go.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.461
Nah, I think this is good for us.

16:57.093 --> 16:58.665
I'm glad you asked me.

17:00.283 --> 17:01.636
This is our chance to talk.

17:02.340 --> 17:03.200
Talk about what?

17:05.041 --> 17:06.662
I figured out our problem, Jess.

17:08.242 --> 17:10.169
You think you're too good for me.

17:10.945 --> 17:13.806
No. No. I don't. I don't.

17:14.651 --> 17:15.631
I just got help.

17:17.222 --> 17:19.686
You can too, you know.
We have kids.

17:23.795 --> 17:25.162
You brought Sammy here?

17:26.786 --> 17:28.637
You know what he did
to that little girl.

17:28.721 --> 17:31.427
You're always paranoid about that stuff.
It's called projection.

17:34.073 --> 17:35.155
What did I do, Jessica?

17:36.233 --> 17:37.507
Nothing, I was talking to Rob.

17:37.591 --> 17:38.716
What'd I do?

17:39.216 --> 17:40.298
Say it.

17:40.382 --> 17:42.188
I was talking to Rob, okay?
I don't know.

17:42.272 --> 17:43.397
You said my name.

17:43.481 --> 17:44.924
Tell me what I did.

17:45.008 --> 17:47.142
Go ahead, tell me what I did.
What'd I do?

17:47.226 --> 17:49.513
I wasn't talking to you,
I was taking to Rob.

17:51.969 --> 17:52.809
Look…

17:54.156 --> 17:55.716
I've a lot to do, okay?

17:55.800 --> 17:58.691
Thank you for getting me out
and I'll call you when we get there, okay?

17:58.788 --> 18:00.658
Oh, she's so busy, Rob. She's so busy.

18:01.408 --> 18:03.598
I think you've just been dismissed, buddy.

18:04.872 --> 18:07.728
I'm tired of getting dismissed by you,
you know that?

18:08.275 --> 18:11.069
I mean. These are my kids, too.

18:11.853 --> 18:12.699
Yeah.

18:20.177 --> 18:21.317
You haven't changed.

18:22.539 --> 18:23.666
You're still weak and needy.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.639
What would've happened to you if I hadn't
gotten you out of that pantry?

18:26.742 --> 18:29.266
Out here in the boondocks.
Miles from the nearest neighbor?

18:30.026 --> 18:31.139
You're right.

18:32.174 --> 18:33.147
I'm sorry.

18:34.103 --> 18:35.630
She's lying.

18:35.714 --> 18:36.847
You're a liar.

18:37.403 --> 18:39.212
She's not sorry. She's a liar.

18:39.296 --> 18:40.392
Lying.

18:40.476 --> 18:42.780
Yeah, you just pretend
I wasn't here, Jess.

18:44.679 --> 18:46.508
I'll tell you what
you don't have to pretend.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.512
I'll put things back the way they were
before I got here.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.689
Rob, stop!

18:51.241 --> 18:53.449
This is you without me.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.207
Stop! Don't! Don't!

18:56.664 --> 18:57.789
Rob, let me go!

19:01.476 --> 19:02.566
Rob, let me go!

19:02.650 --> 19:03.868
Stop!

19:03.952 --> 19:06.271
This is you without me!

19:07.081 --> 19:08.294
Always saving your sorry ass!

19:08.378 --> 19:09.254
Rob, no!

19:12.590 --> 19:14.910
Rob, let me out.

19:16.569 --> 19:18.001
Rob, what are you doing?

19:18.085 --> 19:19.349
<i>…you are learning.</i>

19:21.853 --> 19:23.766
<i>-Mommy, are you in there?</i>
-Lainey.

19:23.850 --> 19:26.486
Go upstairs to my bedroom
and lock the door.

19:26.570 --> 19:29.195
It's a little button on the door.
You turn it. Do you understand?

19:29.279 --> 19:30.738
<i>Why are you in there?</i>

19:30.822 --> 19:32.822
Just go now!

19:33.618 --> 19:34.939
Go now!

19:40.525 --> 19:41.525
Good girl.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.256
Rob?

19:44.765 --> 19:47.758
Please let me out. Please.

19:50.373 --> 19:51.546
What are you doing?

19:58.792 --> 20:00.400
Oh, my God!

20:01.158 --> 20:02.299
Oh, my God!

20:02.383 --> 20:06.366
You put a nail through my hand,
you asshole!

20:08.169 --> 20:09.664
<i>Here's the deal, Jess.</i>

20:10.820 --> 20:12.800
<i>You got a lot of time in there to think.</i>

20:14.111 --> 20:16.065
<i>You've gotten a little too full
of yourself.</i>

20:17.940 --> 20:19.787
Rob, you're high.

20:20.338 --> 20:23.634
You're not thinking straight.
Don't do this.

20:23.718 --> 20:24.767
<i>Rob.</i>

20:24.851 --> 20:26.537
<i>Should I grab the kids?</i>

20:26.621 --> 20:28.274
<i>We need to bring them to my place.</i>

20:29.331 --> 20:32.237
Don't you touch my kids, you asshole!

20:33.880 --> 20:35.079
Rob!

20:35.163 --> 20:37.310
He's a child molester.

20:37.910 --> 20:41.236
Lainey, lock the door. Turn the button.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.277
Rob.

20:45.133 --> 20:48.139
Please don't let him touch our kids.

20:48.744 --> 20:51.421
Please leave them. Please.

20:51.505 --> 20:52.917
<i>Careful with this.</i>

20:53.001 --> 20:55.262
<i>It's pharmaceutical grade.</i>

20:55.346 --> 20:57.733
<i>I'll come back when you're back
to your old self.</i>

20:57.817 --> 20:58.677
Rob.

20:59.618 --> 21:00.701
Don't.

21:01.228 --> 21:04.535
Don't take the kids. Please leave them.

21:06.544 --> 21:07.571
Rob?

21:08.497 --> 21:09.697
Lainey?

21:10.618 --> 21:12.552
Lainey, are you there?

21:13.309 --> 21:14.722
Mommy loves you.

21:16.751 --> 21:18.164
Rob!

21:20.541 --> 21:21.994
Rob!

22:19.461 --> 22:20.714
Lainey?

22:23.119 --> 22:24.226
Lainey?

22:25.339 --> 22:27.591
Lainey, is that you? Are you here?

22:30.761 --> 22:33.241
<i>Mommy, why are you in there?</i>

22:34.390 --> 22:35.817
I got stuck again.

22:37.974 --> 22:40.368
Lainey, where's Mason. Is he okay?

22:41.035 --> 22:42.298
<i>He's sleeping.</i>

22:42.382 --> 22:46.495
<i>I pushed the button on the door and sang
ABC's to him until he fell asleep.</i>

22:48.905 --> 22:50.792
You did a good job, Lane.

22:56.161 --> 22:57.041
Okay.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.974
Lainey, listen very carefully.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.352
I need you to go lock the front door.

23:04.436 --> 23:05.870
You already know how to unlock it.

23:05.954 --> 23:08.724
You just turn that little
metal thing the other way.

23:09.648 --> 23:10.521
<i>Okay.</i>

23:30.624 --> 23:32.111
<i>I turned the lock.</i>

23:32.731 --> 23:34.564
You're a smart girl, Lane.

23:35.767 --> 23:36.639
Okay.

23:38.157 --> 23:39.196
Now.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.135
What did Daddy do to the door.
Can you tell me what you see?

23:42.655 --> 23:44.482
<i>Daddy messed it up. It's broken.</i>

23:45.440 --> 23:48.687
I know, baby.
But what did he nail over it?

23:48.771 --> 23:50.391
<i>All of the Nana's wood.</i>**

23:52.433 --> 23:53.540
The two-by-fours.

23:55.114 --> 23:56.394
Crap.

24:02.917 --> 24:03.750
Okay.

24:04.483 --> 24:05.656
Lainey, listen.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.693
My purse…

24:08.645 --> 24:10.903
No. Not my purse.

24:10.987 --> 24:12.561
My cellphone

24:13.089 --> 24:15.725
is on the floor in the living room.

24:15.809 --> 24:18.263
I need you to go get it and bring it here.

24:18.347 --> 24:20.339
<i>Mommy, please come out.</i>

24:23.908 --> 24:26.284
I need to call 911. Just go get my phone.

24:26.368 --> 24:27.781
<i>What's 911?</i>

24:27.865 --> 24:29.811
Just get the phone, please.

24:37.141 --> 24:38.995
Are you sure you looked everywhere?

24:40.050 --> 24:41.677
It was on the floor.

24:41.761 --> 24:43.699
<i>Mommy, I can't find it.</i>

24:46.321 --> 24:48.599
And my purse is gone too. You sure?

24:48.683 --> 24:49.859
<i>It's not there.</i>

24:51.499 --> 24:52.545
He took it.

24:53.812 --> 24:54.735
Dammit.

24:54.819 --> 24:58.286
<i>Mommy. Come out. I have to pee.
You need to come with me.</i>

25:08.802 --> 25:10.155
Lainey, listen.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.054
It's time for Mason's bottle.
There's one in the fridge.

25:15.287 --> 25:17.647
And he needs his diaper changed too.

25:17.731 --> 25:18.980
And Mommy can't help him.

25:19.064 --> 25:20.831
<i>Mommy I have to pee.</i>

25:20.915 --> 25:22.764
<i>Then go pee.</i>

25:22.848 --> 25:26.302
I can't go with you,
I'm stuck in the pantry.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.651
<i>I miss Nana, I want Nana.</i>

25:44.870 --> 25:46.090
I'm sorry, baby.

25:47.893 --> 25:48.786
I'm sorry.

25:51.424 --> 25:52.690
Mommy wasn't nice.

25:57.955 --> 25:59.482
I miss Nana too.

26:02.178 --> 26:03.925
But we have to take of each other now.

26:05.315 --> 26:06.229
Okay?

26:15.911 --> 26:18.091
<i>Sorry, Mommy. Please don't get mad.</i>

27:06.921 --> 27:08.288
You waited till now?

27:11.091 --> 27:12.444
Okay, Lainey.

27:13.958 --> 27:15.611
You remember how Mommy does it.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.417
You take the wipes from the diaper bag.

27:19.022 --> 27:20.522
Use those to clean him.

27:21.132 --> 27:25.179
Then throw those away with the diaper
and wash your hands after.

27:25.829 --> 27:26.669
You got it?

27:26.753 --> 27:28.150
<i>I know what to do.</i>

27:28.761 --> 27:31.501
And he's heavy, okay? He's not a doll.

27:31.585 --> 27:32.658
<i>I know.</i>

28:12.703 --> 28:14.277
<i>Mommy. I'm hungry.</i>

28:24.116 --> 28:25.234
<i>I finished it.</i>

28:32.869 --> 28:35.482
I'm gonna need you to feed
Mason now, okay?

28:36.987 --> 28:39.660
There's a plastic spoon is a diaper bag.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.173
Use that to feed the baby.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.900
And make sure you sit him up, okay?

28:53.429 --> 28:56.249
<i>Mommy, I'm still hungry and I'm thirsty.</i>

28:56.875 --> 28:58.390
You can drink water from the sink.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.371
Just use the cup there.

29:01.293 --> 29:03.313
<i>I don't like water. I want juice.</i>

29:06.072 --> 29:09.338
I packed up all our food
and juice boxes in the car.

29:10.022 --> 29:11.108
And we need the keys.

29:12.006 --> 29:13.166
And they're in my purse.

29:15.159 --> 29:18.494
And you shouldn't be drinking juice
all the time anyway. It's bad for you.

29:18.578 --> 29:20.087
<i>I'm thirsty for juice.</i>

29:20.607 --> 29:22.574
Drink water.

29:29.510 --> 29:31.077
Don't let him choke.

29:31.844 --> 29:33.518
Sit him up, do you hear me?

29:56.039 --> 29:58.325
Mommy. Mommy, wake up.

30:01.981 --> 30:03.333
It's time for bed, Lane.

30:03.860 --> 30:06.320
No. Please come out. I'm scared.

30:06.974 --> 30:10.137
I can't get out, baby. You know that.

30:11.266 --> 30:12.533
Or else I'd come tuck you in.

30:13.476 --> 30:16.153
You can get out.
You just need to try harder.

30:18.927 --> 30:20.453
I'm trying my best.

30:21.346 --> 30:23.279
A monster's gonna grab me.

30:28.630 --> 30:30.486
There's no monsters, Lane.

30:30.570 --> 30:32.109
It's in the dark.

30:33.258 --> 30:34.824
Mason needs you.

30:35.902 --> 30:36.983
He's all alone.

30:37.093 --> 30:38.816
I wanna stay here with you.

30:41.570 --> 30:42.890
It's cold down here.

30:43.891 --> 30:45.239
The heat's on upstairs.

30:46.434 --> 30:48.934
Just shove a towel under the window
where it won't shut.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.280
Put on towels.**

30:50.364 --> 30:51.720
I'm not cold.

30:52.228 --> 30:53.750
It's just per one night.

30:54.657 --> 30:56.131
I'll be out tomorrow.

30:56.215 --> 30:57.424
Daddy will come back.

30:59.145 --> 31:00.545
Daddy's bad.

31:05.652 --> 31:06.792
Just go to bed, baby.

31:07.783 --> 31:08.783
Okay?

31:10.224 --> 31:11.184
Go on.

Okay, time to feed Mason.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.339
Be careful, okay?

31:48.854 --> 31:50.334
Here you go.

I need your help.

32:46.631 --> 32:47.791
<i>Okay.</i>

32:48.302 --> 32:49.645
<i>Here you go.</i>

32:49.735 --> 32:51.367
That won't work, Lane.

32:52.128 --> 32:53.873
I need something metal.

32:54.415 --> 32:57.175
A tool. So I can chip away the wood.

32:57.259 --> 32:58.914
<i>It's a strong stick.</i>

32:58.998 --> 32:59.951
Keep looking.

33:10.745 --> 33:14.578
Mommy can't break through a wall
with a green crayon, Lane.

33:15.104 --> 33:16.411
You know that.

33:18.026 --> 33:20.656
I need something hard.

33:20.740 --> 33:24.587
I need something metal.
I told you that already.

33:38.488 --> 33:39.995
I'm sorry, Lainey.

33:41.471 --> 33:43.271
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

33:44.542 --> 33:47.062
You're doing the best job. You really are.

34:00.681 --> 34:01.981
I'm a bad mom.

34:03.552 --> 34:04.408
Okay?

34:07.855 --> 34:10.435
I just didn't know how to do it.
I never learned.

34:13.239 --> 34:14.745
And you don't know this, but…

34:16.129 --> 34:19.306
I was just too young when you came around

34:19.391 --> 34:21.304
and I wasn't ready for all of this.

34:22.433 --> 34:23.733
And then…

34:26.627 --> 34:30.507
I left you alone for so long
when I was sick.

34:33.428 --> 34:34.928
I messed up real bad.

34:37.110 --> 34:38.597
But I'm trying.

34:43.369 --> 34:45.081
Just promise me that you

34:46.456 --> 34:47.782
not gonna grow up…

34:49.518 --> 34:52.630
and hate me, like I hated my mom.

35:06.074 --> 35:06.967
Lainey?

35:11.289 --> 35:12.689
Lainey, are you here?

35:13.723 --> 35:14.716
Lane.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.298
Who's here, Lane?

35:20.991 --> 35:22.125
Answer me.

35:28.617 --> 35:31.605
<i>I found it under the leaf,
it's Daddy's tool.</i>

35:32.125 --> 35:33.389
<i>He lost it.</i>

35:33.473 --> 35:36.505
Good job, baby, you did it.

35:37.056 --> 35:39.116
This is exactly what I needed.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.356
<i>I did it.</i>

35:41.439 --> 35:44.484
You're a good girl, Lane. I love you.

35:44.984 --> 35:46.538
I'm gonna take care of Mason.

35:52.430 --> 35:54.190
I'm gonna get out of here.

35:55.044 --> 35:56.227
Just sit tight.

36:46.995 --> 36:48.268
Lainey.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.393
You there?

36:52.813 --> 36:54.407
I'm almost done.

36:56.357 --> 36:59.905
Maybe few more hours
and I can crawl out of the house.

37:04.218 --> 37:05.650
What's going on up there?

37:05.734 --> 37:06.727
<i>Mason!</i>

37:08.856 --> 37:10.158
Lainey?

37:10.242 --> 37:11.669
What happened?

37:15.268 --> 37:16.674
<i>I dropped the baby.</i>

37:16.758 --> 37:19.343
Oh, God! Oh, God!

37:19.427 --> 37:21.394
<i>I was trying to crawl down the stairs.</i>

37:22.888 --> 37:25.098
<i>-Mommy, I'm sorry.</i>
-It's okay. It's okay.

37:25.746 --> 37:27.029
It's okay. It's okay.

37:27.113 --> 37:30.340
You need to pick him up and hold him
until he stops crying.

37:31.581 --> 37:34.188
He's alone and he's scared right now.

37:35.412 --> 37:37.739
<i>He wants milk, but it's all gone.</i>

37:41.139 --> 37:42.339
You need to make him a bottle.

37:42.449 --> 37:45.748
You remember how Mommy does it?
It's three scoops of formula.

37:45.832 --> 37:47.222
The powder is in the can.

37:47.311 --> 37:50.579
You fill it up with water,
put a nipple on tight and shake it.

37:51.089 --> 37:52.115
<i>Okay.</i>

37:52.896 --> 37:53.743
You can do it.

38:29.232 --> 38:30.372
Lainey?

38:32.352 --> 38:34.065
Almost there.

38:36.372 --> 38:37.518
I can do this.

38:39.268 --> 38:40.237
It's gonna be fine.

38:47.580 --> 38:48.420
Lane?

38:55.854 --> 38:57.636
Mommy, someone's here.

38:59.890 --> 39:00.837
Who's here?

39:01.812 --> 39:02.775
Is it Daddy?

39:02.859 --> 39:04.759
It's that man who called my a fry.

39:06.604 --> 39:07.451
Okay.

39:08.396 --> 39:11.202
Lainey, please tell me
you locked the front door.

39:11.286 --> 39:12.319
<i>He's coming in.</i>

39:13.339 --> 39:14.679
<i>Hello?</i>

39:16.057 --> 39:16.891
<i>Hello?</i>

39:17.560 --> 39:18.569
<i>Anybody home?</i>

39:18.653 --> 39:21.387
Lainey, run upstairs to the bedroom
and lock the door.

39:21.471 --> 39:23.147
<i>Maybe that man can get you out.</i>

39:23.231 --> 39:25.031
He's bad, Lane. Run!

39:38.410 --> 39:39.484
<i>Hello?</i>

39:43.943 --> 39:45.283
<i>Anybody home?</i>

39:47.463 --> 39:48.803
<i>Little girl?</i>

40:10.449 --> 40:12.452
<i>Jessica.</i>

40:12.536 --> 40:13.689
Where's Rob.

40:14.941 --> 40:16.021
Is he with you?

40:18.216 --> 40:19.436
<i>Rob is busy.</i>

40:20.669 --> 40:22.648
<i>So I thought I'd come in</i>

40:23.557 --> 40:24.517
<i>babysit for you.</i>

40:24.614 --> 40:26.153
We don't need a babysitter.

40:26.966 --> 40:27.952
I'm fine.

40:29.782 --> 40:31.096
Please leave my house.

40:31.955 --> 40:35.248
<i>You really like to dismiss people,
don't you, Jessica?</i>

40:37.452 --> 40:38.286
<i>You know…</i>

40:41.246 --> 40:42.299
<i>Your daughter…</i>

40:44.110 --> 40:45.163
<i>She's very pretty.</i>

40:46.366 --> 40:47.260
<i>Very pretty.</i>

40:48.494 --> 40:49.328
<i>Where is she?</i>

40:49.839 --> 40:50.919
<i>Is she upstairs?</i>

40:51.003 --> 40:54.213
Rob's gonna be pretty pissed
at you if you mess with his kids.

40:54.998 --> 40:56.868
<i>…go upstairs, Jessica.
Is that where she is?</i>

40:56.952 --> 40:58.472
Stay away from them!

40:58.556 --> 41:01.089
<i>Rob owes me money.</i>

41:04.258 --> 41:06.725
<i>And I'm here to collect
the payment, Jessica.</i>

41:08.900 --> 41:11.966
No, stop! Wait! Wait!

41:12.667 --> 41:13.920
<i>Little girl?</i>

41:15.688 --> 41:16.816
<i>Little girl? Where are you?</i>

41:16.900 --> 41:18.443
LARGE KITCHEN MATCHES

41:20.625 --> 41:22.534
HOLY BIBLE

41:24.396 --> 41:26.403
I have Rob's meth.

41:26.987 --> 41:28.847
It's yours, I haven't used it.

41:30.498 --> 41:32.838
I got probably three grams down here.

41:35.380 --> 41:38.840
Come on, don't let it go to waste.
Rob just gonna take it back.

41:59.804 --> 42:01.921
<i>He gave you three grams?</i>

42:02.880 --> 42:04.846
<i>-And he owes me money?</i>
-Yeah.

42:05.653 --> 42:08.293
And it's all yours, if you want it.
It's all yours.

42:08.377 --> 42:09.313
<i>Okay.</i>

42:10.431 --> 42:11.785
<i>Send it under the door.</i>

42:12.955 --> 42:14.635
<i>-Go ahead.</i>
-Let me out.

42:15.418 --> 42:16.444
And it's all yours.

42:16.944 --> 42:17.871
<i>Let you out.</i>

42:20.220 --> 42:22.467
<i>No can do, Jessica. No.</i>

42:23.246 --> 42:26.198
<i>I don't get involved in domestic dispute.</i>

42:26.282 --> 42:28.118
Well, call the police.

42:29.085 --> 42:30.998
Or let me use your phone, please.

42:32.407 --> 42:35.329
<i>Not calling the police.</i>

42:35.839 --> 42:37.892
<i>Not getting you out.</i>

42:39.250 --> 42:40.970
<i>Send it under the door, Jessica.</i>

42:41.712 --> 42:44.299
If I give you the meth
will you leave us alone?

42:44.840 --> 42:47.620
You have to leave the house.
And you can't go back.

42:49.345 --> 42:52.676
<i>Of course, Jessica. I'll go. I'll leave.</i>

42:54.417 --> 42:55.457
<i>You have my word.</i>

42:58.128 --> 42:59.588
<i>Put in under the door.</i>

43:25.389 --> 43:26.335
<i>Jessica.</i>

43:28.531 --> 43:30.851
<i>Put it under the door, Jessica.</i>

43:32.847 --> 43:34.987
<i>-Jessica.</i>
-Sorry, I just…

43:36.289 --> 43:37.249
I'm injured.

43:38.859 --> 43:41.225
I'm too weak to get close enough.

43:43.316 --> 43:45.553
Reach under the door
and I'll drop it in your hand.

43:45.637 --> 43:47.765
<i>You sound fine to me, Jessica.</i>

43:47.849 --> 43:49.680
<i>Just push it under the door.</i>

43:49.764 --> 43:50.927
I can't reach that far.

43:51.011 --> 43:53.377
<i>Push it under the door, Jessica.</i>

43:53.461 --> 43:55.948
I'm stuck over here on the other end,
I can't move much.

43:59.576 --> 44:00.869
Have you tried it yet?

44:02.981 --> 44:04.829
Rob said it's good stuff.

44:09.474 --> 44:11.465
If you can't decide I'm gonna dump it out.

44:11.549 --> 44:14.032
<i>Hey. Hey, hold on.</i>

44:21.830 --> 44:23.365
<i>Okay.</i>

44:26.374 --> 44:27.414
<i>Where is it?</i>

44:28.472 --> 44:30.125
<i>Can you reach my hand?</i>

44:30.837 --> 44:31.704
Almost.

44:31.788 --> 44:32.672
Just…

44:33.659 --> 44:35.659
Just can you stretch out
a little bit more?

44:42.661 --> 44:44.988
<i>Okay, that's as far as I can go.</i>

44:46.311 --> 44:48.149
<i>Can you reach my hand?</i>

44:48.233 --> 44:49.506
I can just reach it.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.214
<i>Okay. Drop it in my hand.</i>

44:54.530 --> 44:55.630
Here it comes.

44:59.726 --> 45:01.145
Jessica!

45:02.083 --> 45:03.565
Jessica? What have you done?

45:08.870 --> 45:11.859
Take it out! Take it out, you bitch!

45:12.542 --> 45:13.685
What did you do to me?

45:13.769 --> 45:16.120
I'm getting out of here.
I swear. I'll leave now.

45:16.204 --> 45:18.691
-You'll get out when I get out.
-Take it out. I'm so scared.

45:18.793 --> 45:21.631
Keep your other hand out of her
or I will cut it off!

45:22.853 --> 45:25.320
I've got your kids.
Now free me, you whore.**

45:25.404 --> 45:27.277
<i>Get it out of my hand!</i>

45:27.361 --> 45:30.030
<i>Get it out of my hand, you bitch!</i>

45:30.127 --> 45:31.492
<i>Get it out!</i>

45:32.007 --> 45:34.599
<i>What did you do? Get it out!</i>

45:35.100 --> 45:37.547
<i>Get it out! Get it out now!</i>

45:39.277 --> 45:40.673
<i>Please!</i>

45:40.757 --> 45:43.506
<i>Please. Okay. Okay.</i>

45:43.590 --> 45:44.634
<i>Please.</i>

45:45.486 --> 45:46.760
<i>Take it out. Take it out.</i>

46:11.991 --> 46:13.784
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

46:15.418 --> 46:17.342
<i>It smells like liquor.</i>

46:17.847 --> 46:19.251
<i>Wow.</i>

46:20.296 --> 46:21.669
<i>No liquor, doc?</i>

46:22.860 --> 46:24.433
<i>You little bitch!</i>

46:25.160 --> 46:26.390
<i>I'll kill you.</i>

46:33.833 --> 46:36.133
<i>Jessica, please.</i>

46:39.514 --> 46:41.021
Let go.

46:41.789 --> 46:42.829
I was freezing.

46:44.748 --> 46:46.520
There's a storm coming in.

46:46.604 --> 46:50.067
I just heard on the news
it's gonna be freezing.

46:50.151 --> 46:51.244
Please.

46:51.989 --> 46:55.098
I get cold. I get cold easy.

46:55.690 --> 46:57.218
I don't like the cold weather.

46:57.302 --> 46:59.187
You left my front door open.

46:59.857 --> 47:01.510
I hope you freeze to death.

47:02.769 --> 47:03.876
What?

47:06.545 --> 47:08.087
What did you say?

47:08.171 --> 47:10.336
You hope I freeze to death?

47:10.839 --> 47:14.289
Oh, you hope I freeze to death?

47:22.162 --> 47:25.949
Hope? You hope I freeze to death?

47:26.535 --> 47:28.178
You're an idiot.

47:28.262 --> 47:31.515
People who use hope are desperate.

47:32.224 --> 47:35.839
They're desperate people.
Weak people.

47:35.923 --> 47:37.023
Shut up.

47:37.827 --> 47:39.667
I heard you went to rehab, Jessica.

47:41.194 --> 47:43.354
Oh, yeah, Rob told me.
He told me all about it.

47:43.438 --> 47:46.057
Oh, yeah. Jessica went through rehab.

47:46.141 --> 47:49.018
Did they teach you hope at the rehab?

47:49.102 --> 47:51.408
That's what they taught you?
They taught you to hope?

47:52.203 --> 47:54.456
Right after they tool all of your money.

47:55.303 --> 47:58.230
Oh, yeah. I know that routine, Jessica.

48:00.310 --> 48:01.875
I went through rehab.

48:02.396 --> 48:03.582
Oh, yeah.

48:04.123 --> 48:06.395
I was clean and sober

48:06.939 --> 48:08.712
for a long time, Jessica.

48:08.796 --> 48:10.013
I got a job.

48:10.526 --> 48:11.914
I took college courses.

48:11.998 --> 48:14.664
I even filed a tax return.

48:15.987 --> 48:16.934
And then,

48:17.778 --> 48:19.174
After my mother died…

48:21.318 --> 48:22.978
I realized that

48:23.654 --> 48:26.941
No one in the whole world…

48:28.806 --> 48:31.226
gave a shit about me anymore.

48:32.196 --> 48:35.002
That's what they didn't teach me in rehab.

48:35.086 --> 48:37.426
They didn't tell me when I got sober

48:38.524 --> 48:41.580
that I would go back
to the same miserable life

48:42.080 --> 48:44.194
I used drugs to get away from.

48:48.550 --> 48:49.696
Jessica.

48:54.944 --> 48:57.644
You still got the three grams
in there with you?

49:00.515 --> 49:01.395
Yes.

49:04.972 --> 49:07.198
You ain't gonna last long, Jessica.

49:07.908 --> 49:11.205
-Stop talking to me.
-You know it. I know it.

49:16.150 --> 49:17.023
You know something?

49:18.195 --> 49:21.455
I can smell the weakness from here.

49:22.071 --> 49:23.657
I can smell it.

49:23.741 --> 49:26.919
The stink from weakness.

49:28.169 --> 49:29.060
You and I…

49:31.568 --> 49:32.774
We understand.

49:32.866 --> 49:35.848
I don't molest little girls. I hate you!

49:35.932 --> 49:37.433
And I hate everyone like you!

49:37.517 --> 49:39.096
How many people do you know

49:39.610 --> 49:41.237
like me, Jessica?

49:43.867 --> 49:45.354
Did somebody touch you?

49:47.685 --> 49:48.999
You were a little girl?

49:50.927 --> 49:55.001
But their hands on you, Jessica,
when you were a little girl.

49:55.085 --> 49:57.588
-Stop talking to me! Stop talking to me!
-Little Jess.

49:57.672 --> 49:58.949
Did you like it?

49:59.033 --> 50:01.651
I said stop talking to me!

50:17.537 --> 50:18.950
<i>Please, Jessica. Please.</i>

50:19.622 --> 50:21.231
<i>It's freezing in here.</i>

50:21.315 --> 50:22.668
<i>I'm cold.</i>

50:23.182 --> 50:24.189
<i>I'm cold.</i>

50:36.160 --> 50:37.322
<i>What are you doing, Jessica?</i>

50:37.406 --> 50:38.543
I'm getting out.

50:41.239 --> 50:43.672
You'll scratch your way out
like a little mouse?

50:45.921 --> 50:47.187
You know I…

50:48.140 --> 50:49.360
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

50:50.100 --> 50:51.526
-Or your kids.
-Yeah, right.

50:52.239 --> 50:53.119
I like it.

50:54.838 --> 50:56.032
I'm not a bad guy.

50:57.159 --> 50:58.419
You're a monster.

51:04.874 --> 51:05.767
Dammit.

51:07.150 --> 51:09.223
Power's outage, top bitch.

51:12.745 --> 51:13.998
-Lainey.
<i>-Mommy.</i>

51:14.082 --> 51:16.226
Lainey! Lainey!

51:17.225 --> 51:20.752
Lainey, stay upstairs,
do not come down here!

51:21.736 --> 51:23.452
<i>-Mama.</i>
-Lainey!

51:23.536 --> 51:25.173
Lainey! Go back!

51:25.257 --> 51:27.837
Go back upstairs, do not come down here!

51:29.404 --> 51:31.304
<i>-Mommy, are you in there?</i>
-Lane--

51:31.899 --> 51:34.099
-Lainey run! Run away!
<i>-Mommy.</i>

51:34.635 --> 51:36.235
<i>I got her! I got her!</i>

51:36.319 --> 51:37.235
<i>Take it out!</i>

51:37.319 --> 51:39.324
Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!

51:39.408 --> 51:42.094
<i>Take it out now or I'll crush her leg.**</i>

51:42.178 --> 51:43.816
I'll pull it out. Do not hurt her!

51:43.900 --> 51:45.363
<i>Mommy he got me!</i>

51:46.913 --> 51:49.283
Hold on. I need to find
a way to get it out!

51:49.368 --> 51:50.414
<i>Mommy, help!</i>

51:50.510 --> 51:52.040
Okay, hold on.

51:53.989 --> 51:56.259
<i>Dammit! What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

52:00.043 --> 52:01.715
<i>What are you doing?</i>

52:11.949 --> 52:12.789
<i>Put it out!</i>

52:12.873 --> 52:15.023
Run, Lainey! Run!

52:15.107 --> 52:17.070
Get away from him!

52:17.154 --> 52:18.154
<i>What did you do?</i>

52:18.238 --> 52:19.122
Lainey, run!

52:20.535 --> 52:22.424
-Lainey!
<i>-Stop! Put it out now!</i>

52:22.938 --> 52:24.621
<i>Now! Put it out!</i>

52:24.705 --> 52:26.368
<i>Put it out! Put it out!</i>

52:27.405 --> 52:29.705
<i>Please! Please!</i>

52:33.897 --> 52:35.010
<i>Put it out!</i>

54:10.283 --> 54:11.476
Lainey?

54:17.788 --> 54:19.682
Let me know you're okay.

They come to you in sheep's clothing,

56:32.817 --> 56:35.611
but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.

56:36.122 --> 56:37.949
By their fruit you will recognize them.

56:38.609 --> 56:40.520
Do people pick grapes from thorn-bushes,

56:41.500 --> 56:43.420
or figs from thistles?

56:45.360 --> 56:48.482
Likewise, every good tree
bears good fruit,

56:49.090 --> 56:51.410
but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

56:51.966 --> 56:54.576
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit,

56:54.660 --> 56:57.039
and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.

56:58.034 --> 57:01.398
Every tree that does not bear good fruit
is cut down and thrown into the fire.

you will recognize them."

Mommy's here. Hello.

01:04:55.944 --> 01:04:57.541
You did a good job.

01:04:59.436 --> 01:05:01.409
You did such a good job. Thank you.

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:03.891
Thank you. You did so good.

01:05:50.995 --> 01:05:51.928
Okay.

Hold Mason, okay?**
Good girl. Good girl.

01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:00.390
Thank you. Keep him warm. Thank you.

01:07:20.595 --> 01:07:22.368
Mommy, I'm hungry.

01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:33.228
Mama, I wanna go back inside.

01:07:33.312 --> 01:07:34.528
Come on. Come here.

01:07:35.265 --> 01:07:36.165
Come here.

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:40.642
I'm cold.

01:07:42.327 --> 01:07:43.971
Hold your brother.

01:07:44.055 --> 01:07:46.383
Hold him tight, baby.
Hold your brother. Hold him.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:06.618
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

01:08:12.294 --> 01:08:13.300
The Animal Crackers.

01:08:13.384 --> 01:08:15.349
Leave it. Leave it.

01:08:15.433 --> 01:08:16.779
Come on, baby. Let's go.

01:08:17.379 --> 01:08:19.899
Staying here is dangerous.
Come on. Let's go, come on.

01:08:27.174 --> 01:08:29.506
Can I have Animal Crackers now?

01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:47.622
Okay.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:48.827
I'm gonna go get them.

01:08:51.642 --> 01:08:52.956
Okay, here.

01:08:54.386 --> 01:08:55.741
You take Mason, okay?

01:08:56.416 --> 01:08:57.482
You got him?

01:08:57.983 --> 01:08:59.308
Hold him tight.

01:09:00.194 --> 01:09:01.488
And keep him warm, baby.

01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:05.863
Okay.

01:09:35.111 --> 01:09:36.325
Lainey!

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:40.935
Lainey, let me in!

01:09:48.991 --> 01:09:50.206
Lainey!

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:51.130
Lainey!

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:57.212
Lainey!

01:09:57.296 --> 01:09:58.400
Lainey!

01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:02.088
Lainey!

01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:05.526
Sit down! Sit down!

01:10:06.029 --> 01:10:07.029
No, no!

01:10:07.556 --> 01:10:08.449
Let them go!

01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:11.170
Stop crying! Stop crying!

01:10:11.254 --> 01:10:12.187
Mommy's here!

01:10:12.271 --> 01:10:13.740
Let them go, please!

01:10:13.824 --> 01:10:17.090
Please. Please. Please, let them go.

01:10:17.174 --> 01:10:20.284
I said please 12 times, Jessica!

01:10:20.945 --> 01:10:22.638
Remember? Please? Please?

01:10:22.722 --> 01:10:24.722
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:10:24.806 --> 01:10:26.666
Please. Please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:10:27.247 --> 01:10:29.453
-Let them go!
-Mommy? You want Mommy?

01:10:29.537 --> 01:10:30.396
You want Mommy?

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.984
Mommy, I wanna go.

01:10:32.564 --> 01:10:35.135
-Just sit tight, okay, baby?
-What did you do to my hand?

01:10:35.718 --> 01:10:39.225
Stop! Stand there! Don't move!

01:10:39.309 --> 01:10:42.100
The meth is still in the pantry,
downstairs, you can have it, okay?

01:10:42.184 --> 01:10:43.655
You can have it. Just let them go.

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.015
Yeah?

01:10:45.684 --> 01:10:48.153
There's money in there, too.
There's like a thousands of--

01:10:48.237 --> 01:10:50.182
There's a lot of money.
It's my grandma's money--

01:10:50.266 --> 01:10:52.148
You can have it, just--
Just give me the baby.

01:10:52.232 --> 01:10:53.932
I'm gonna cut your baby!

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.467
-Stop! Stop! Let them go!
-Don't cry.

01:10:56.551 --> 01:10:58.757
Don't cry. Don't cry.

01:10:59.927 --> 01:11:02.511
Please, just please stop.
Please let them go.

01:11:03.204 --> 01:11:05.968
Don't move! Move again and I'll cut him!

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.757
Drop the knife, Sammy.
Drop the knife!

01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:10.862
What the hell are you doing
here with my kids?

01:11:10.946 --> 01:11:13.454
That bitch put a screwdriver
through my hand--

01:11:13.538 --> 01:11:15.940
I don't wanna hear it now.
Drop the knife!

01:11:16.024 --> 01:11:19.201
-She put a screwdriver through my hand!
-Drop the knife, man! Drop it!

01:11:19.285 --> 01:11:21.558
You owe me money, Rob!
You owe me money!

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:25.283
Drop the knife on the floor!
Drop the knife!

01:11:25.367 --> 01:11:27.437
-All right. It's down. It's down.
-Drop the knife!

01:11:27.521 --> 01:11:29.011
It's down.

01:11:29.095 --> 01:11:29.934
That's good.

01:11:30.781 --> 01:11:34.081
Let go off my kids. That's good.
Don't worry, baby. You go with mom.

01:11:36.252 --> 01:11:37.492
You didn't answer my question.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:41.436
-Look what she did to my hand.
-What're you doing here with my kids?

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.263
-What, are you some kind of pedophile?
-You owe me money!

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:46.994
What is that?

01:11:47.078 --> 01:11:48.718
The tree branch fell, baby.

01:11:49.761 --> 01:11:51.488
Jessica, where are you going off to?

01:11:52.882 --> 01:11:54.328
Thank you for coming back.

01:11:55.298 --> 01:11:57.143
I just wanna get the kids outta here.

01:11:57.683 --> 01:11:59.278
I just need my car keys.

01:11:59.362 --> 01:12:00.429
The kids are safe.

01:12:01.327 --> 01:12:03.307
Sammy won't hurt them now.
I took care of it.

01:12:03.941 --> 01:12:05.255
-Come on.
-So…

01:12:07.026 --> 01:12:08.675
Was this about your Nana's money?

01:12:16.507 --> 01:12:18.707
I think that was easier
to pull up than to take down.

01:12:20.858 --> 01:12:22.730
I need to get the kids to the doctor.

01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:26.109
Well, they look fine to me.

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:29.003
Don't be such a helicopter parent.

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:32.916
They're hungry. We need to eat.
It's freezing. And my hand is infected.

01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:35.010
Yeah, uh….

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:52.890
Looks like you had a little fun in here.

01:12:54.063 --> 01:12:55.883
I didn't. I'm still clean.

01:13:01.234 --> 01:13:04.158
Holy shit, you weren't lying.

01:13:07.943 --> 01:13:10.356
Holy shit balls!

01:13:10.973 --> 01:13:13.575
Fuck! Baby.

01:13:17.595 --> 01:13:19.315
Do you know what this will buy us?

01:13:19.399 --> 01:13:21.693
You can take it, okay?
Just have all of it.

01:13:22.254 --> 01:13:24.068
Just go and leave us alone.

01:13:29.952 --> 01:13:30.894
You never shot it?

01:13:36.028 --> 01:13:37.181
Wanna try?

01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:44.394
Come on, we'll do it together.

01:13:47.555 --> 01:13:48.772
Okay.

01:13:51.914 --> 01:13:53.101
Okay?

01:13:53.185 --> 01:13:54.452
Yeah, I'm ready, let's do it.

01:13:58.979 --> 01:14:01.839
There's food out in the car.
I wanna feed the kids first.

01:14:03.209 --> 01:14:04.705
We should eat something too.

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:08.555
It's important to eat or we'll get sick.
You know that.

01:14:14.734 --> 01:14:15.787
Yeah.

01:14:16.294 --> 01:14:18.128
Yeah. All right. Let's eat first.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.427
I'll get the food, you stay here.

01:14:38.571 --> 01:14:40.348
Can I have some?

01:14:40.432 --> 01:14:41.581
No, baby.

01:14:41.665 --> 01:14:43.281
This is for Daddy.

01:14:44.236 --> 01:14:46.009
He's bringing our food in from the car.

01:14:47.899 --> 01:14:49.212
Daddy's bad.

01:14:50.441 --> 01:14:52.334
Yeah. He is.

01:15:02.058 --> 01:15:02.995
Jess, you're ready?

01:15:04.004 --> 01:15:05.506
I've got some better stuff here.

01:15:06.052 --> 01:15:08.292
I just picked it up on my way over.

01:15:10.082 --> 01:15:11.382
Better than what you gave me.

01:15:12.969 --> 01:15:14.442
You said it was pharma-great.

01:15:15.992 --> 01:15:17.392
Yeah, well, I was wrong.

01:15:17.476 --> 01:15:20.506
That shit's got heavy.
I took one hit and lost it pretty bad.

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:22.275
That's why I got here so like…

01:15:22.873 --> 01:15:23.899
So it wasn't my fault.

01:15:24.843 --> 01:15:26.583
I'm glad you didn't take it.

01:15:27.097 --> 01:15:28.604
I'm sticking to crystals for now.

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.773
I'm not hungry, don't worry about it.

01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:40.890
You need to eat first.

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.554
You saw the way Sammy was,
just wasted away.

01:15:48.135 --> 01:15:49.649
You have to make yourself eat.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.973
Even when you don't feel like it.

01:15:56.829 --> 01:15:57.882
Yeah.

01:15:59.256 --> 01:16:00.166
Yeah, you're right.

01:16:01.759 --> 01:16:03.106
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

01:16:23.106 --> 01:16:24.070
That's good.

01:16:26.424 --> 01:16:27.651
What is this crap?

01:16:27.735 --> 01:16:30.482
Looks like little old crap, you know?

01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:33.102
It's my Nana's apple butter.

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.443
Eat up.

01:17:06.675 --> 01:17:08.799
Can we do that in the living room, please?

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.109
I don't want the kids to see.

01:17:14.718 --> 01:17:15.748
Yeah, sure.

01:17:33.557 --> 01:17:34.644
Your turn.

01:17:37.659 --> 01:17:38.619
Here.

01:17:48.541 --> 01:17:49.688
I'm not ready yet.

01:17:51.791 --> 01:17:53.015
I'll do it later.

01:17:55.001 --> 01:17:56.235
No way.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.027
Come on, we're doing this together.

01:18:00.504 --> 01:18:01.378
Hurry up.

01:18:02.933 --> 01:18:04.773
I got one more hit in this needle.

01:18:06.673 --> 01:18:08.028
Well, I wanna clean needle.

01:18:11.879 --> 01:18:12.883
You tie yourself off.

01:18:19.548 --> 01:18:21.381
It's for your own good.

01:18:26.761 --> 01:18:27.668
Hey. Hey.

01:18:28.527 --> 01:18:29.767
I don't wanna hurt you, Jess.

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:31.903
I never did.

01:18:43.021 --> 01:18:44.101
Come on.

01:18:44.185 --> 01:18:45.389
My hand is hurt.

01:18:48.117 --> 01:18:49.144
Come here.

01:18:51.825 --> 01:18:52.953
Bitch!

01:18:53.798 --> 01:18:56.413
Get up and tie yourself off
before I shoot you in your face!

01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:59.703
That's right.

01:19:03.468 --> 01:19:04.751
Come on.

01:19:04.835 --> 01:19:06.268
Go ahead and kill me.

01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:11.958
Tie yourself off!

01:19:18.786 --> 01:19:19.886
Hey. Hey.

01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:21.379
Where are you going, Jess?

01:19:22.566 --> 01:19:24.019
Where are you going, Jessica?

01:19:25.163 --> 01:19:26.736
Where are you going, Jess?

01:19:31.818 --> 01:19:32.924
Get back here!

01:19:35.588 --> 01:19:36.843
Come on, Jess!

01:19:39.144 --> 01:19:40.784
Why are you running away from me, huh?

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:44.612
I'm gonna stick this needle
in your arm. I'm doing it.

01:19:46.066 --> 01:19:48.393
Shit, you gotta make this
so hard on yourself?

01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:50.829
You got to rehab one time.

01:19:50.913 --> 01:19:54.306
You think you're better than everyone
and you cut me out like I'm nothing?

01:19:56.215 --> 01:19:57.318
Like I said,

01:19:57.402 --> 01:20:00.678
the only problem between us is that
you think that you're better than me.

01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:03.107
But you're not.

01:20:03.191 --> 01:20:05.067
All right? We're the same.

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.230
We're the same.

01:20:15.983 --> 01:20:17.533
Goddamnit.

01:20:26.902 --> 01:20:28.296
You're OD'ing.

01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:30.715
What'd you give me, Jess?

01:20:30.799 --> 01:20:33.042
I gave you three grams
of your shitty-cut meth.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:35.845
The stuff that you locked me up with.

01:20:36.372 --> 01:20:38.919
While my babies cold and alone.

01:20:39.003 --> 01:20:40.509
And in danger.

01:20:41.029 --> 01:20:43.742
And I was rotting away
in the fucking pantry.

01:20:44.978 --> 01:20:46.151
You're nothing!

01:20:47.448 --> 01:20:48.634
I'm not nothing.

01:20:52.416 --> 01:20:53.616
I'll break you, Jess.

01:22:11.852 --> 01:22:13.273
APPLE BUTTER

01:22:53.119 --> 01:22:55.006
Oh, really? Oh, really?

01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:59.742
Mommy, I got you an apple, it was hiding.

01:23:00.345 --> 01:23:02.645
You did? Let's take a look at it.
Come here.

01:23:04.842 --> 01:23:05.989
Hey.

01:23:08.768 --> 01:23:10.413
I got some good news.

01:23:10.497 --> 01:23:13.644
Cafe in town ordered 20 jars
of Nana's apple butter.

01:23:13.728 --> 01:23:16.120
They gonna put it
on their pecan waffles.

01:23:16.236 --> 01:23:18.181
-Isn't that cool?
-Is it good? Is it good?

01:23:19.155 --> 01:23:20.215
Is the apple good?

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.011
Well…

01:23:24.553 --> 01:23:26.867
Just one little brown spot here.

01:23:28.791 --> 01:23:30.091
We cut it out.

01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:35.140
These are good parts, remember?

01:23:49.217 --> 01:23:51.909
Okay, baby, let's practice
the ABC's, okay?

01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:53.626
Ready?

01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:56.956

01:23:57.773 --> 01:24:01.186
