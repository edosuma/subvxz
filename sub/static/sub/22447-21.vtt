Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.290 --> 00:08.620
-Your mother bought The Fringe?
-You didn't know?

00:08.620 --> 00:10.460
I wanted to discuss
the plan with you first,

00:10.460 --> 00:12.670
and then I thought,
we could tell him together.

00:12.670 --> 00:14.080
What plan?

00:14.080 --> 00:17.750
To remodel The Fringe.
Make you the go-to
makeup artist.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.250
I love that plan!

00:19.250 --> 00:20.790
I kissed Jonah.

00:20.790 --> 00:23.380
-Bye-bye, Walker.
-Yeah.

00:23.380 --> 00:25.120
You two had
so much in common.

This is our last day together.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.420
I wish I could take this moment

00:31.420 --> 00:33.710
and put it in a time capsule.

00:33.710 --> 00:36.830
-That's a great idea.
-I wasn't serious.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.420
Time Capsule Buffy
is too quiet.

01:20.420 --> 01:23.420

and turn your head
and think,

01:23.420 --> 01:25.040
she's gonna be sitting there?

01:25.040 --> 01:26.880
Sometimes I do see her

Yeah, well, I've been ignoring

is at least tell him why.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.170
When he's speaking to me again.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.920
I say we put
the shelves here.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.710
(gasps)
Do you want an island?

12:28.710 --> 12:31.380
-My own island?
-We can get you an island.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.080
I'm getting an island!

12:33.080 --> 12:35.080
Call the contractor
and make sure he's on board
with all this.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.460
On it.

12:38.210 --> 12:42.080
Hi, Bill, Celia and I
just wanted to run
a few things by you.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.790
-(phone beeping)
-Oh...

12:44.790 --> 12:46.460
Oh, it's Andi.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.170
(sighs) Not now.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.960
Sorry, where was I?

12:50.960 --> 12:53.500
(phone ringing)

12:53.500 --> 12:56.210
It's Andi again.
Um, just-- Okay.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.710
Hey, Bill,
it's Celia.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.120
Andi, hi.
Is this important?

13:01.120 --> 13:02.830
Andi:
Yes. Jonah saw me
wearing Walker's shoes,

13:02.830 --> 13:05.710
-and now he's very upset.
-Oh, no, that's awful.

13:05.710 --> 13:07.580
Hey, Bex, do you want
to explain your idea

13:07.580 --> 13:09.000
about the workstation
to the contractor?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.250
Yeah, be right there.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.790
Do you mind if we talk
about this a little later?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.250
I'm kind of in the middle
of something?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.500
-Okay.
- All right, great, thanks.
Love you, bye.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.500
I'm back. Did you
ask about reworking
the entrance?

13:17.500 --> 13:19.210
-No.
-Okay.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.540
Bill, hi.

13:23.420 --> 13:24.960
Have you talked
to Jonah yet?

13:24.960 --> 13:27.330
Nope.
He's been avoiding me.

13:27.330 --> 13:31.000
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.
Avoidance is not the way
to deal with your problems.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.250
Says the guy
who ditched PE today.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.580
I just couldn't face
somersaults, okay?

13:37.250 --> 13:41.040
Don't give me that look.
I know it was wrong.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.040
If Real Buffy were her,
she'd tell you not to give up.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.880
If Real Buffy were here,
I'd be afraid to give up.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.210
Do you think it's worth
trying to ask Real Buffy?

13:50.210 --> 13:52.750
Why not?
People win the lottery,
get struck by lightning.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.670
Maybe it won't
go straight to voice mail.

13:57.210 --> 13:58.790
-(line ringing)
-(sighs)

13:58.790 --> 14:00.920
(voice mail) It's Buffy.
You know what to do.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.750
-(beeps)
-Straight to voice mail.

14:04.830 --> 14:07.170
Hey.
Who's your friend?

14:07.170 --> 14:09.290
Uh, it's kind
of a long story.

14:09.290 --> 14:11.920
It's Buffy.
It's how we pretend
she's still around.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.380
Got it.
I didn't recognize her.

14:15.380 --> 14:16.790
(whining)
Go away, TJ!

14:16.790 --> 14:20.290
Oh, now I see
the resemblance.

14:20.290 --> 14:23.120
Can I sit?

14:23.120 --> 14:25.250
I think she'd be okay
with it.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.290
I'm not sure
I'm okay with it.

14:27.290 --> 14:30.670
You were awful to her.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.540
And even though she's gone...

14:33.540 --> 14:36.540
she's still here in spirit.
(sighs)

14:38.290 --> 14:39.670
Buffy...

14:40.960 --> 14:42.460
I know I should've
done this to you in person,

14:42.460 --> 14:46.540
but I was a jerk,
like big-time.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.210
And I'm sorry.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.120
You didn't deserve that.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.000
So, what were you guys
talking about?

15:00.000 --> 15:03.290
Ah, you know, the weather,
current events, price
of hot lunch.

15:03.290 --> 15:06.210
So you let me sit down,
but you won't even
talk to me?

15:06.210 --> 15:11.120
I'm sorry, it's private.
I'm having a physical issue.

15:12.330 --> 15:13.420
Oh.

15:13.420 --> 15:16.040
Wait. No, stop imagining
horrible things.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.120
I-- I can't do
a somersault, okay?

15:18.120 --> 15:20.920
In fact, there's a whole list
of easy things that I can't do.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.620
-(laughs)
-He's serious.
There is a list.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.330
(phone vibrates)

15:26.330 --> 15:28.290
Just sent it to you.

15:28.290 --> 15:32.460
Listen, Underdog,
if you can't do a somersault,
I can help you with that.

15:32.460 --> 15:35.210
(door bells tinkle)

15:35.210 --> 15:36.540
(quietly)
Andi, there he is.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.380
Go talk to him about,
you know.

15:38.380 --> 15:41.250
-Here? Now?
-Go talk to him.

15:43.380 --> 15:45.000
Jonah.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.460
Hey.

15:46.460 --> 15:47.750
Oh, hey.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.250
Can we sit?

15:49.250 --> 15:50.380
Sure.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.830
I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.330
We really don't have to.

15:57.330 --> 16:01.290
But we do,
because I realize
that you probably

16:01.290 --> 16:04.380
don't know something
that I thought you did.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.460
So I wanted
to tell you officially--

16:06.460 --> 16:07.710
Natalie:
Hey, Andi!

16:08.710 --> 16:10.580
You remember
my friend Natalie?

16:10.580 --> 16:12.330
How could I forget?

16:12.330 --> 16:14.120
You eating lunch with us?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.960
Oh, I would, but I already
have a table over there.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.170
Cool, we'll just
come and sit with you guys.

16:21.420 --> 16:22.380
You coming?

16:26.290 --> 16:27.420
(sighs)

16:33.500 --> 16:34.420
This is happening?

16:37.380 --> 16:39.960
I... actually, should get going.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.790
-Really?
-Really?

16:41.790 --> 16:44.330
I just remembered
I have to be...

16:47.000 --> 16:49.080
not here.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.250
(door bells tinkle)

16:53.250 --> 16:56.250
I should probably head out too.
I have to go to work.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.750
You want
to come with me?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.210
Yes! Please!

17:02.920 --> 17:05.380
(door bells tinkle)

17:06.790 --> 17:09.620
-Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

17:11.380 --> 17:13.380
Why are we sitting
with a trash can?

17:20.620 --> 17:22.330
You work at a gym?

17:22.330 --> 17:25.000
You should've told me.
I hate gyms.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.580
You'll like this one.

17:26.580 --> 17:29.250
This is where
you're gonna learn
to do a somersault.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.380
Says the athlete
with boundless confidence.

17:31.380 --> 17:34.170
You don't know

a kugel of a man.

Bex:
That is on there good.

23:58.710 --> 23:59.960
What are you doin' here?

23:59.960 --> 24:00.750
Obviously, I had to be here

24:00.750 --> 24:03.000
when you tried out
for the ultimate elite team.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.880
Are you nervous?

24:04.880 --> 24:07.290
That's not a team.
That's a platoon!

24:08.460 --> 24:10.790
-We should get going.
-Okay, I'm almost done.

24:10.790 --> 24:11.880
What are you making?

24:11.880 --> 24:13.120
A bracelet for Jonah.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.790
Andi has something
she'd like to tell Jonah.

24:15.790 --> 24:17.120
Did you really have to?

24:17.120 --> 24:19.080
You clearly
weren't going to.
