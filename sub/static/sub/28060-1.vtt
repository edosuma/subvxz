00:12.262 --> 00:15.098
[woman]
<i>So, we took a look at your CT scans.</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:16.058
[Michael]
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

00:16.141 --> 00:19.811
[woman] And we do see
a large mass in your stomach

00:19.895 --> 00:21.939
as well as several lesions
on your liver.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
At this point, I recommend
that you see a specialist,

00:25.025 --> 00:28.904
and I can help you with a recommendation
and get you a list of people.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.697
And then go from there.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.118
[Michael]
What kind of specialist?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.621
[clicks tongue]
An oncologist.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.668
-That's the cancer one?
-Yes.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.881
-So, you think it's bad?
-We don't really know,

00:47.965 --> 00:50.509
which is why I think it's important
for you to see a specialist.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.554
He'll do a biopsy, more tests and...

00:53.637 --> 00:55.806
What do you think though?
What do you think about it?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.516
You've seen it and all.
What do you think?

00:57.599 --> 01:00.185
-Do you know how bad it is?
-At this point, I don't really know.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.313
But you can tell us something, right?
Can you tell us something?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.815
-[Andy] Don't you have to say--
-It's okay.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.234
-I don't think she--
-She doesn't--

01:07.317 --> 01:09.319
I think... I think...
How about... All right, listen.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.905
How about this? How about
I'm gonna make a statement?

01:11.989 --> 01:14.950
And if it's a true statement,
you don't have to correct me.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.412
And you don't have
to say anything to me.

01:19.371 --> 01:22.874
Okay? So is what Michael has...

01:24.084 --> 01:25.502
incurable?

01:25.586 --> 01:28.171
Dude, that's a question.
You gotta... It has to be--

01:28.255 --> 01:29.756
It has to be a statement. All right.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.924
So, my statement is...

01:31.049 --> 01:33.260
-what Michael has is incurable.
-That's it.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.181
Do you understand the game?
'Cause you're not saying anything.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.350
I don't know if that's...
I don't know...

01:40.434 --> 01:42.686
if that's cause you understand
what we...

01:42.769 --> 01:44.438
Did you see <i>All the President's Men?</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:49.526
Um, remind me of your relationship.
How do you know each other?

01:51.028 --> 01:51.862
Oh. Uh...

01:51.945 --> 01:54.031
-We're, uh... We're neighbors.
-Yeah.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.283
-Okay.
-I live on top of him.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.869
[upbeat music plays]

01:58.952 --> 02:00.954
[clattering]

02:11.715 --> 02:13.550
[Andy]
There's still shit in the bottom of this.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.676
[Michael]
Yeah, there is.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.428
[Andy] It's gross.
I'm not reaching in there.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.679
[Michael]
I know. I'll get it.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.264
[Andy]
And the ball's gonna be gross.

02:19.348 --> 02:22.684
-[Michael] Okay. Did you serve yesterday?
-[Andy] Yeah. Yeah, it's your serve.

02:22.768 --> 02:23.977
Hold on.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.940
Hold on. Go.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.657
[inaudible]

03:11.483 --> 03:13.485
[inaudible]

03:36.717 --> 03:38.135
[Andy]
So, uh...

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
that, uh, cancer thing.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.432
-What happened with the specialist guy?
-He was special.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.352
All right. Come on, Michael.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.817
Don't... Don't drop it!

04:19.050 --> 04:21.928
I'll... tell you what happened
at lunch today.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.305
[Michael]
What's up?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.599
I was at the diner next to my office.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.641
Yeah.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.811
I had that booth by the window, and...

04:30.395 --> 04:33.482
this guy floats by the window.
Guy just floats by the window.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.820
I mean, he floats. I mean, I just see...
I can't see his bottom.

04:38.904 --> 04:39.821
Yeah.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.449
His bottom ain't moving.
You can tell he's not moving. You know...

04:43.325 --> 04:44.576
He floated by the window.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.830
-He was probably on a hover board.
-Skateboard?

04:48.914 --> 04:52.209
No, that... You know, those things
those kids do. They put it on their feet--

04:52.292 --> 04:55.045
Yeah, I know he was on a hover board
but it just started me thinking.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.713
Just saw a guy hover.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.508
Can you imagine that?
That would screw up your whole life.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.384
So, he hovered? So what?

05:02.219 --> 05:04.721
If you saw a guy hover, so what?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.473
Yeah, so a guy hovers.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.351
So, life's normal for you
right after that?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.061
I don't have a problem with it.

05:11.853 --> 05:17.359
So, all rules of reality,
thousands of years of science,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.903
everything, now means nothing?
It means nothing?

05:20.612 --> 05:21.905
I'll be like, cool.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.408
You wouldn't be cool.
You wouldn't be cool if a guy...

05:25.492 --> 05:26.701
Of course I would.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.037
No, you wouldn't.
If there was no rules.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.582
You go to put your sneakers on,
and they're pumpkins.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.835
You blow your nose, a nickel comes out.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.128
You look in the mirror,
your face is a...

05:37.629 --> 05:39.005
Is a peg board.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.215
-I'm fine with that.
-Yeah.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.342
I know you're bullshitting.
Give me my thing.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.928
My hands are airplanes so just don't look.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.805
Yeah. Well, get on one of them

05:46.888 --> 05:50.058
and fly to fucking where guys don't hover.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.185
Because that's where I live.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.773
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>That's the death punch.</i>

05:58.149 --> 05:59.568
<i>Master! No!</i>

06:18.920 --> 06:19.963
[man on TV]
<i>Master.</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:22.966
<i>Your death punch</i>

06:23.049 --> 06:24.259
<i>Had I landed the punch,</i>

06:26.928 --> 06:28.305
<i>Three steps in any direction,</i>

06:29.014 --> 06:31.016
<i>and your heart would explode.</i>

06:31.099 --> 06:32.142

06:40.817 --> 06:41.651
[Andy]
Okay.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.362
There was, uh...

06:44.446 --> 06:47.616
-There was five. I took three.
-That's not okay.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.452
One's a... One's dwarf one,
so it evens out.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.621
Sure hope to see you tomorrow night.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.625
Yeah, Trivial Pursuit.
I won the last two of those.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.876
Have a good night, Andy.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.086
Hmm. [laughs]
See you!

07:00.170 --> 07:02.172
[rain patters]

07:11.389 --> 07:12.724
[Andy]
Good night, Michael.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.018
[Michael]
Good night, Andy.

07:15.810 --> 07:20.106
[Michael grunts and coughs]

07:27.530 --> 07:29.115
[horn honks]

07:30.325 --> 07:31.242
Good morning.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.331
Thank you.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.752
Sir, that's, uh...That's my pen.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.754
Thank you.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.594
Hi.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.096
Andy?

07:51.721 --> 07:52.806
Hmm.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.891
-Hi.
-Hi. How are you?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.227
[sighs]

07:57.310 --> 07:59.020
I'm okay. I'm okay.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.647
-Yeah?
-Yeah, sure.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.857
Did you have a good weekend?

08:02.941 --> 08:04.693
-My... My weekend?
-Mm-hmm.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.486
-[Andy] Yeah, she did it.
-[Michael] Who?

08:06.569 --> 08:09.322
[Andy] The new girl.
She said, "How are you?"

08:09.406 --> 08:11.533
[Michael] Oh, God, small talk.
How'd it go?

08:12.033 --> 08:13.743
[Andy]
Horrible. It's horrible.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.787
-Spin.
-[Michael exclaims] Damn it.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.325
[Dr. Laurey]
<i>Well, there are a few options.</i>

08:54.868 --> 08:56.870
[Dr. Laurey continues indistinctly]

08:58.705 --> 08:59.789
I see.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.048
[Andy]
Good night, Michael.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.300
[Michael]
Good night, Andy.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.178
[microwave beeps]

09:59.140 --> 10:01.768

10:35.969 --> 10:37.512
[Andy]
Wait? No.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.806
[Michael]
I got it. I got it.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.393
-We're a second-half team.
-[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.186
I could give a...

10:46.146 --> 10:47.021
a great...

10:47.605 --> 10:50.066
half-time speech if I was a coach. I...

10:50.692 --> 10:53.361
I really have this best speech
I've ever heard at half-time.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.572
-[Michael] What is it?
-[Andy] I'm working on it.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.657
I think it's "fatty pork."

10:58.199 --> 11:00.118
It's not "fatty pork." I...

11:00.827 --> 11:03.496
-I made the shirt. I know it's not--
-You made it about two years ago.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.082
-You still remember what it is?
-It was a year and a half ago,

11:06.166 --> 11:08.042
and if it was "fatty pork",
there'd be two T's.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.794
There'd be another T right there.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.715
It's a "satay fork."
Little fork. Little appetizer fork.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.426
No, it's not-- Nothing in the kitchen.
Get out of the kitchen.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.971
I'll give you that info, and that's it.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.558
That's a good one.
That was a year and a half...

11:25.560 --> 11:29.189
Sort of think...
I like that it bothers you.

11:30.899 --> 11:34.110
Did you eat my cashews?
I have no cashews left.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.949
I just got walnuts.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.334
I could tell you.
Want me to tell you?

11:50.585 --> 11:52.545
I saw the oncologist and...

11:55.548 --> 11:57.926
I saw a second oncologist. He, um...

12:03.932 --> 12:05.683
Long story, but they, um...

12:06.517 --> 12:08.228
You know, there's nothing they can do.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.521
So...

12:12.357 --> 12:13.816
[stammers]
it's...

12:14.776 --> 12:15.693
It's that.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.529
The dying part is...

12:21.324 --> 12:23.326
Meh. It's meh.

12:27.288 --> 12:31.834
The hospital, the tubes, the bloating.
I don't want any part of that.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.589
So, I'm thinking...

12:40.426 --> 12:41.427
before...

12:42.637 --> 12:43.972
before it gets bad...

12:47.058 --> 12:48.101
I want to...

12:49.310 --> 12:50.270
end it...

12:50.979 --> 12:54.315
They got a whole process. If you get
less than six months they give you this...

12:55.275 --> 12:56.484
these pills you can take.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.736
And you can do it at home.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.779
Sounds...

13:00.405 --> 13:01.322
You know.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.950
But I don't want to do it alone and...

13:06.995 --> 13:08.579
I was hoping you would help me out.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.294
Me?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.257
Uh...

13:20.383 --> 13:21.634
Do... I mean...

13:25.221 --> 13:26.264
The way...

13:28.933 --> 13:31.644
You gotta... You can't give up.
Huh? You gotta...

13:32.729 --> 13:35.606
You can't do that.
Miracles happen, right?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.445
What about the guys who say,
"You got six months to live" and...

13:40.528 --> 13:42.905
next thing you know,
he's climbing Mount Everest.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.326
Jim Abbott had one arm.
Remember Jim Abbott on the Yankees?

13:46.409 --> 13:47.410
He had one arm.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.995
He pitched a no-hitter.

13:49.787 --> 13:50.913
He didn't give up.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.833
You don't give up, Michael.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.712
They already gave me the prescription.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.549
They can do that?
They can just give you that...

14:02.258 --> 14:03.634
medicine that kills you?

14:03.718 --> 14:04.552
Yeah.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.599
I don't want you
to look at me like this.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.269
But I was not gonna tell you

14:13.353 --> 14:15.772
'cause I didn't want it
to change things, you know?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.525
You know...

14:20.568 --> 14:21.861
I want to make some pizzas.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.489
I want to watch some movies.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.742
I want to play some Paddleton.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.243
You know?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.164
[sighs deeply]

14:41.172 --> 14:42.048
Yeah?

14:42.590 --> 14:43.466
Okay.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.641
Should we play the second half?

14:52.183 --> 14:53.351
Yeah, right? We gotta.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.272
[Michael]
It's your serve.

14:58.940 --> 14:59.774
Lay it out.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.628
[shouts and exerts]

15:20.711 --> 15:22.255
[Andy]
These are all pretty far away.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.090
[Michael]
What's that?

15:24.173 --> 15:27.343
The places where your doctor said
we could fulfill the...

15:28.219 --> 15:29.887
prescription. The closest one is...

15:30.763 --> 15:31.764
almost six hours.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.182
-Six hours?
-Yeah.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.935
[Andy] A lot of pharmacies won't fill it
'cause of moral reasons.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.146
All right,
Guess we're gonna do a little road trip.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.564
What does that mean? Road trip?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.109
You don't just do a road trip, right?

15:43.192 --> 15:44.068
[fire alarm beeps]

15:44.152 --> 15:45.611
What do you mean,
what does that mean?

15:45.695 --> 15:48.906
We'll drive there. We'll get the meds,
we'll find a place...

15:48.990 --> 15:52.285
Your stove burnt the pizza up. It's burnt.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.619
Fuck!

15:54.287 --> 15:55.788
[Andy]
Come on!

15:55.872 --> 15:57.832
It's ruined now. It's ruined.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.333
-Hold on.
-[Andy] No, I'm not gonna.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.419
We can't eat that.
We gotta eat something else.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.504
-[Michael] It's not that bad.
-What are we gonna eat?

16:04.213 --> 16:06.424
-Nice work.
-Look at that piece of shit!

16:06.507 --> 16:07.842
Ah, this is fucked!

16:08.468 --> 16:09.594
You gonna eat that still?

16:10.595 --> 16:11.721
[Michael]
It's gonna be good.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.776
Grab a plate.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.032
I'll try it.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.074
All right.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.245
[Andy]
How about the air in the tires?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.624
[Michael]
Yeah, I put a bunch in. It's okay.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.292
[Andy]
Not too much though, right?

16:41.375 --> 16:43.503
There's no such thing as too much air.

16:43.586 --> 16:44.921
Oh, yeah there is.

16:45.922 --> 16:46.923
Huh?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.342
How about the Hindenberg?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.344
That was helium.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.429
Yeah, but it was too much.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.643
[Andy] Hey, I had some oatmeal
so I'm gonna need a bathroom in two hours.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.938
[Michael] But you also had
a second coffee, so maybe 90 minutes?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.530
[Andy]
I can still see.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.032
-[Michael] What do you see?
-I see everything.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.535
I see everything. Yeah, I do.
There's a tree. There's a...

17:16.160 --> 17:17.036
What's that?

17:17.995 --> 17:19.330
A person or a chicken.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.374
If you had to live like this...

17:21.832 --> 17:25.086
You could adapt. That's the great thing
about the human mind.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.630
This is how bees see.

17:29.674 --> 17:33.344
[Andy] How many wishes would a genie
have to give you where...

17:34.053 --> 17:37.598
one of those wishes would be sand off?

17:37.682 --> 17:38.641
What's sand off?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.977
Whenever you said "sand off"...

17:41.894 --> 17:45.606
every grain of sand
that was on your body fell off.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.026
Twelve hundred, maybe?

17:49.110 --> 17:51.696
No, ten.
If they gave me ten, I would do it.

17:51.779 --> 17:55.992
You can only think of nine wishes
before you get to sand off?

17:56.075 --> 17:57.493
How many you need?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.078
Okay, uh...

17:59.161 --> 18:00.079
your first one.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.123
All the cancer's gone.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.209
Then a billion dollars, flying, whatever.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.377
Invisible.

18:06.460 --> 18:09.672
Invisible, and then sand off, yeah.
Well, pajamas on.

18:09.755 --> 18:13.301
Pajamas... It's late at night,
you're tired. "Pajamas on."

18:14.051 --> 18:15.219
[Andy]
You got enough gas?

18:15.303 --> 18:17.096
[Michael]
There's a buffer. I think we're okay.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.472
Well, not that big a buffer.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.516
What's the worst case scenario?
We run out of gas.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.269
What's the worst case scenario?
We run out of gas here, right?

18:24.020 --> 18:26.022
Next thing you know,
we're drinking our urine.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.652
How do you get from running out of gas,
the next step is drinking urine?

18:31.736 --> 18:33.529
You can hitchhike. You can...

18:33.613 --> 18:35.615
We'll call somebody.
We'll walk to the gas station.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.326
-There's nobody out here.
-You go right to drinking urine.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.578
[Andy]
It's like <i>Twilight Zone </i>out here.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.830
[Michael] How's that half-time speech
coming, by the way?

18:42.913 --> 18:44.081
It's good.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.541
Oh, yeah?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.960
I could sell it.
But if I told it to a coach,

18:48.669 --> 18:50.296
they'd want to buy it from me.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.673
Hey, guys, gather around.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.134
That's how it starts. Yeah.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.595
-[Michael] That's more like it
-[Andy] That's the beginning.

18:57.678 --> 18:58.888
That's it.

18:58.971 --> 19:04.393
[cell phone vibrates]

19:05.895 --> 19:08.230
-[Andy] Who is that? What's that?
-[Michael] It's my sister.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.194
She knows, right?

19:14.236 --> 19:17.865
She knows about the cancer,
but not about the other stuff.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.534
I kind of want to keep that
to myself.

19:22.036 --> 19:22.912
Oh.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.164
What about me?

19:25.623 --> 19:27.041
No, that's...

19:27.833 --> 19:29.377
That's different. That's, you know...

19:29.960 --> 19:30.836
[Andy]
Huh.

19:31.629 --> 19:32.713
Yeah.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.174
-You know?
-Yeah.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.092
Yeah.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.427
I get it.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.390
She does small talk, your sister?

19:42.473 --> 19:43.683
Hmm.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.975
The queen.

19:45.059 --> 19:45.935
Yeah.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.522
Ooh. Ostrich farm. Three miles.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.691
-Uh, yeah.
-We're doing that.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.443
Eh... You want to?

19:55.069 --> 19:57.446
-I've never seen an ostrich.
-I've seen them.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.865
-I've seen them on TV.
-Yeah, but in person, though.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.410
They're kind of nasty, though.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.954
-Really?
-They'll run right at you.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.591
Fastest land animal, actually.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.387
-I don't think it is.
-Yeah.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.472
Yes, it is. Forty miles an hour.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.435
The cheetah goes...

20:28.436 --> 20:30.104
60 or 65.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.606
Yeah. That's four legs.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.486
Per leg...

20:41.115 --> 20:42.074
they're the fastest.

20:42.658 --> 20:46.787
[upbeat guitar music plays]

21:09.393 --> 21:11.103
[Michael]
Okay, I think we're getting close.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.659
[Michael]
Looks like a tourist town or something.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.204
[Andy]
A lot of windmills in this town.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.627
[Michael]
You're walking really fast, Andy.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.378
[Andy]
I'm not nervous.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.590
We talk to the guy, Phil,
and we got a plan, right? Okay.

21:39.673 --> 21:43.761
This sinus infection is so awful.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.763
-[pharmacist] I know.
-And I feel like I...

21:45.846 --> 21:49.892
I feel like this medication I've taken
before and it hasn't worked.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.977
-Give it a try, okay?
-Okay.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.979
-Have a good rest of the day.
-Thank you.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.564
All right. Bye, bye, Judy.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.193
Hi, guys. What can I do for you?

21:59.276 --> 22:01.821
Hi, there. We're here to see Phil.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.740
Phil's not in today. I'm Dave.
I'm standing in for Phil.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.910
We talked to Phil though.
You spoke to Phil.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.662
Yeah, we, uh... But...

22:10.287 --> 22:13.082
-Okay. So we should come back.
-But I can help you guys.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.542
Yeah, but this is something...

22:16.627 --> 22:19.046
-This is kind of top secret.
-I spoke to Phil. It's a...

22:19.129 --> 22:21.841
He was gonna... It's a special
medication he was gonna...

22:21.924 --> 22:24.260
-Are you Michael Thompson?
-I'm Michael. Yeah.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.970
You want to call Phil maybe?

22:26.053 --> 22:28.681
It's okay. I can handle it. Yeah.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.015
Michael Thompson.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.726
I don't like that. We should come back
for Phil. Let's come back.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.520
[Michael]
Why are you so obsessed with Phil?

22:34.603 --> 22:37.231
[Andy] What if he puts something wrong
in there. Could be dangerous.

22:37.314 --> 22:40.401
Give me one second.
I'll get you guys dialed in here.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.611
All right. How are you guys doing today?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.281
[clears throat]
Okay.

22:47.491 --> 22:51.036
-There are three medicines involved.
-We know all this part.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.788
This is what we did with Phil.
That's why...

22:52.872 --> 22:53.706
Phil told us.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.416
If Phil was here
he wouldn't say that to us

22:55.499 --> 22:56.917
'cause we already spoke to him.

22:57.001 --> 23:00.504
I understand, but Phil told me
I had to read these instructions.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.007
It's protocol.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.550
-Okay, go ahead.
-Thank you.

23:04.633 --> 23:08.554
Okay, so you'll be taking two of these
one hour before taking the drink.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.723
This one is for anxiety.

23:11.265 --> 23:14.143
This one is for nausea.
It'll keep you from vomiting.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.395
And this one ran all the way home.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.439
-[Michael] The little piggies.
-Yeah.

23:20.316 --> 23:24.820
Um, and in the event of vomiting
after ingesting the drink,

23:24.904 --> 23:27.239
the patient should have
a family member contact

23:27.323 --> 23:30.451
their referring physician
to determine a course of action.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.494
This big one...

23:33.996 --> 23:35.998
is the medicine you'll be taking last.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.167
There are 100 pills in this bottle,

23:39.460 --> 23:41.962
which is the lethal dose.
[clears throat]

23:42.046 --> 23:43.172
Can you ring it up now?

23:43.589 --> 23:45.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.800
-You're not paying for this.
-Oh, no. Yeah.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.928
I didn't tell you about this,
but here, take the card.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.138
-Take the card and ring it up.
-Andy, it's $3,500.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.432
I know what it is.
I have more money than you.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.142
-I want to do this.
-It's a lot.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.226
I want to do it.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.103
Let me do it.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.230
Thank you.

24:00.314 --> 24:03.025
-[card swipe machine beeps]
-I'm sorry, sir. Your card was declined.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.112
It's not declined.
You gotta put it through.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.697
-You gotta run it through.
-Nice one.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.574
-Okay.
-Can you run it through again?

24:10.658 --> 24:12.451
My mistake. I'll give it another shot.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.662
You know that those things glitch a lot.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.206
-Sorry, declined again.
-Give me the card.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.958
-Give me the card.
-I'll pay for it.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.627
I'm just gonna call the bank up,
that's all.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.004
-I can pay for it  and you pay me back.
-Give me your phone.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.090
Give me your phone.
Don't ring anything up,

24:26.173 --> 24:29.176
'cause this'll take one second.
I'm gonna call the number right there.

24:29.259 --> 24:32.596
I see the number right there. Give me
one second. Don't ring anything up.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.891
You will have to empty the contents

24:36.392 --> 24:38.268
of all 100 pills into a glass

24:38.352 --> 24:40.980
-and mix them with half a cup of water.
-It's Andy Freedman.

24:41.063 --> 24:45.150
The drink will be a little bitter,
but you want to drink it all at once.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.361
[Andy] It's me, though.
What do you want me to tell you?

24:47.444 --> 24:48.821
I am out of town.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.365
[Dave]
If the patient decides they don't...

24:51.448 --> 24:52.992
You don't...

24:53.075 --> 24:55.995
want to end their life after ingesting

24:56.078 --> 24:57.705
-the medication...
-[Andy] Okay.

24:57.788 --> 25:00.624
...they must contact
emergency medical services

25:00.708 --> 25:03.002
-to begin lifesaving measures.
-[Andy] I'm not yelling.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.380
-I'll stop yelling, but I'm not yelling.
-Yeah.

25:06.463 --> 25:07.506
Mm-hmm.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.676
[Andy] Well, send it then.
They're gonna send a code.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.885
I don't have a phone.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.014
That's why you're supposed
to have a phone.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.143
I have e-mail.
Can I see my e-mail on your e-mail?

25:19.727 --> 25:22.229
Uh, Phil has his log-in codes.
I don't have it.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.024
See? Why don't we wait for Phil?
Let's just wait for Phil to come back,

25:25.107 --> 25:26.984
-And none of this happens.
-It's gonna be fine

25:27.067 --> 25:31.113
Hold on. I sent you my pet name
about five years ago.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.489
Is that it? Are we done?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.700
Yes, yes. Uh, yeah, I read it all.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.453
-Let me just pay for it. I got it.
-[Andy] Yeah. Why...

25:37.536 --> 25:39.121
-Where does it go?
-He's okay?

25:39.204 --> 25:40.664
[Andy]
Where does my pet name go?

25:40.748 --> 25:41.623
No!

25:45.961 --> 25:46.795
What are you doing?

25:47.337 --> 25:49.339
What do you mean?
I'm taking a pain pill.

25:49.840 --> 25:50.966
I don't know. I just...

25:52.217 --> 25:53.343
I thought it was...

25:54.428 --> 25:55.846
[receptionist]
<i>Velkommen.</i>

25:55.929 --> 25:57.097
Can I help you?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.518
Hi, we have a reservation for...

26:02.102 --> 26:04.021
-Freedman.
-Okay.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.272
I have it right here.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.191
-No, I got it.
-Printed it out.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.150
Here you are.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.611
You're all set. I just need
a credit card for incidentals...

26:10.694 --> 26:14.823
Okay. I'm gonna give you a credit card,
but if you could wait until the end to

26:14.907 --> 26:17.117
do whatever you have to do with it.
I'll call the bank,

26:17.201 --> 26:19.411
-and it's all gonna be fine.
-Let me just...

26:20.037 --> 26:21.080
I'll get this one.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.874
[Andy] Okay, you get it.
Put it on his card, but I'm paying for it.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.084
It's all going down.

26:25.167 --> 26:28.003
-I'm gonna pay it all back, okay?
-That's fine.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.047
-It's 79 a night, yes?
-It is.

26:30.631 --> 26:31.590
Every penny.

26:31.673 --> 26:32.841
All... I'm keeping...

26:33.717 --> 26:35.344
-[receptionist] Okay.
-All right, thanks.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.054
So, guys, I got you, um...

26:37.763 --> 26:38.847
two queens.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.349
-Um...
-Right.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.476
We have another room with a king.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.353
We don't want two rooms.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.648
I'm sorry. Not two rooms.
Would you prefer to have a king?

26:51.193 --> 26:53.195
If you feel more comfortable,
we're fine with that.

26:54.947 --> 26:55.948
The queens are good.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.976
Guess I'll take that then, right?

27:24.726 --> 27:26.353
[Andy] The bag. I'll hold the bag.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.815
Keep it in my house
just so we know where it is.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.283
I mean, I...

27:40.325 --> 27:41.160
I just...

27:41.869 --> 27:44.538
Just assumed, you know, I'd hold onto it.

27:46.498 --> 27:50.169
I got a safe place in my closet.
Up behind the, uh...

27:51.420 --> 27:52.546
the box. I have that...

27:53.755 --> 27:55.883
The Rod Carew rookie card.
I got that little...

27:57.384 --> 27:59.386
I don't think anybody's gonna steal it.

28:00.179 --> 28:04.516
[Andy] Who knows? Sandy got broken into
two times and she's on the ground floor.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.227
They always go to the ground floor first.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.688
I'm up on top.
If the water main breaks...

28:10.147 --> 28:14.443
over on Hillside and then it floods,
I'm up top.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.745
[exhales]

28:33.462 --> 28:35.172
[exhales heavily]

29:40.988 --> 29:42.823
-Cash or charge?
-Cash.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.420
[Michael burps]

30:02.676 --> 30:03.719
[Andy]
You awake now?

30:06.680 --> 30:07.556
Yeah.

30:08.098 --> 30:10.225
-[grunts] Sorry.
-[Andy] Yeah.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.269
I slept for a long time, sorry.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.730
I know. It's all right.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.773
[Michael sighs]

30:23.864 --> 30:24.865
What's this?

30:26.158 --> 30:27.159
<i>Tree of Wisdom.</i>

30:28.869 --> 30:29.703
Andy.

30:35.042 --> 30:35.876
Oh, yeah.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.170
Yeah, that's, uh...

30:39.546 --> 30:41.089
Now we got nothing to worry about.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.926
Nothing can go wrong now.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.221
-All right, very funny.
-[Andy] It was my idea.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.182
It's very funny.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.017
It's not funny. That's a good idea.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.353
Where's the medication?
Where is it?

30:54.853 --> 30:55.729
It's in there.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.397
It's locked up.

30:57.481 --> 31:00.442
We don't got to worry about
any of that stuff we were talking about.

31:03.653 --> 31:04.529
What's the code?

31:06.281 --> 31:07.199
The code to what?

31:07.657 --> 31:10.327
[chuckles]
Andy.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.288
[Andy]
There's no code.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.249
There's a combination.

31:17.084 --> 31:17.959
Okay.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.754
What's the combination?

31:21.880 --> 31:22.798
No hints.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.550
Andy, I don't want to play a game
right now.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.303
-Can you give me the code?
-No, just don't worry about it.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.514
This is the end here.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.859
[Michael]
Maybe we should try getting a drink.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.244
[woman]
<i>Uh, the sign-up list is still open.</i>

31:52.327 --> 31:55.580
<i>Honestly, if you don't want to do</i>
<i>anything, it's just gonna be more of me.</i>

31:56.164 --> 31:57.082
[mic squeaks]

31:57.165 --> 31:58.041
[woman]
<i>Okay.</i>

31:58.792 --> 31:59.835
[Andy] Ah.

32:01.461 --> 32:02.629
We should drink more.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.214
Right?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.341
I think I'm gonna start drinking.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.344
Yeah. I mean,  it's not good for you,
but it is good.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.180
So, you feeling ready?

32:13.181 --> 32:14.266
Coach?

32:14.891 --> 32:16.643
-My speech?
-Half-time speech.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.187
It's not ready yet.
I don't want to jinx it.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.397
Hmm.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.858
I stumbled on something
that's really gonna be something.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.736
-Hey, Andy?
-Yeah.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.656
Is there a half-time speech?

32:30.949 --> 32:33.869
You think I'm lying about that?
Why would I lie about it?

32:33.952 --> 32:36.329
Remember that time you told me you
spoke Spanish and then...

32:36.413 --> 32:38.707
I over-exaggerated how much I knew,

32:38.790 --> 32:42.127
but that's because I was trying
to impress you. We weren't friends yet.

32:42.711 --> 32:43.753
I got to pee.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.506
-Definitely get another one.
-Okay.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.216
All right, I'll be back.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.851
Gather round, guys.

32:58.685 --> 32:59.811
Gather round, guys.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.272
Take a knee.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.691
Everybody just take a knee.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.944
Do me a favor, guys. Close your eyes.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.238
I want you to close your eyes.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.366
Everybody, close your eyes.
I want you to picture something.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.704
We're gonna lose this game.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.248
We're gonna lose this game, guys.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.876
Just listen to me.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.378
The momentum has switched.

33:25.462 --> 33:26.713
That's a better team.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.883
No matter what I say here,
that ain't gonna turn it around.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.968
We're gonna lose this game.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.554
But so what? I'm proud of you.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.807
I'm proud of you.
I don't want to wait to the end

33:37.891 --> 33:39.893
when you're hurting to say that.
You guy's are...

33:39.976 --> 33:41.686
You don't need this game.

33:41.770 --> 33:44.564
You're gonna have good lives.
You're all good guys. You're gonna...

33:44.648 --> 33:46.441
You're gonna be something
in your life.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.860
Murphy, you're gonna be
in the Navy, right?

33:48.944 --> 33:50.654
You're gonna be a hero one day.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.657
Cahill, you're a writer.

33:54.658 --> 33:55.867
You're gonna live somewhere...

33:55.951 --> 33:57.577
You're gonna live
in Connecticut somewhere.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.454
By the water.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.583
And you'll have a drinking problem maybe,
but that makes you a better writer.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.795
It's all gonna be okay.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.466
You're gonna have great lives,
and maybe you're gonna have a...

34:12.676 --> 34:15.512
a little empty feeling in your gut.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.851
And maybe when you lay at night,
secretly you're gonna think...

34:24.271 --> 34:25.188
"You know what?

34:26.022 --> 34:27.065
If I could go back...

34:28.525 --> 34:30.986
This is all good,
but if I could ever go back...

34:31.570 --> 34:35.615
If I could go back in time I would go
to the day we lost that big game

34:35.699 --> 34:37.701
and I would play that second half
over again."

34:37.784 --> 34:40.996
Well, guess what guys?
Open your eyes! You're back!

34:56.177 --> 34:59.055
-Okay, now I got it.
-[man] Oh, there he is.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.058
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.560
How did this...

35:03.643 --> 35:04.477
What's going on?

35:04.561 --> 35:08.189
He was alone. Nobody likes to be alone.
I invited him.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.192
Okay, all right.
So, now you're over here now?

35:11.776 --> 35:13.862
-Yeah, have a little--
-Get out of my seat.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.782
[Michael] No, you stay. You sit.
Andy, take my seat.

35:18.325 --> 35:19.409
-Cheers, guys.
-Cheers.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.411
-Oh, yeah.
-New friends.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.996
-[Dave] Cheers, man.
-All right.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.497
-[Michael] New friends.
-New friends.

35:24.581 --> 35:27.208
So, David was telling me
he's a kung fu fan.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.960
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.462
We were talking, so...

35:30.545 --> 35:33.131
Oh, yeah. Of course. You're that too.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.508
-All right.
-Yeah. I like kung fu. You like kung fu?

35:35.592 --> 35:36.509
Everybody likes...

35:36.593 --> 35:38.470
Well, have you watched <i>Death Punch?</i>

35:39.095 --> 35:40.430
Yeah, I've seen <i>Death Punch.</i>

35:41.097 --> 35:42.349
And what do you think?

35:43.516 --> 35:45.518
It's pretty good. Not bad.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.522
Not a lot of fighting in it,
you know, but...

35:49.606 --> 35:50.982
Yeah, it's good.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.610
It's a kung fu movie.
It's not about fighting.

35:54.569 --> 35:58.156
It's learning about
what's inside yourself.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.658
That's what <i>Death Punch</i> is.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.118
-You didn't see that?
-I... Well, you know...

36:02.202 --> 36:04.871
I saw it on YouTube.
Maybe I missed some parts.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.331
[woman]
<i>And I'm back.</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:08.291
<i>The sign-up list is still open.</i>

36:08.375 --> 36:11.127
[Andy] How can you see it on YouTube?
You can't see it on YouTube.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.296
-It's ridiculous.
-All right, well...

36:13.380 --> 36:16.633
I don't mean to be, uh...
[grunts]

36:16.716 --> 36:18.426
How can you find it on DVD?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.929
You can find it on DVD.
You can find it on a VHS.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.223
I recommend watching it on VHS.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.557
-VHS? Really?
-Yes.

36:24.641 --> 36:27.894
-Because that's how it's meant to be seen.
<i>-Hi, everybody. My name's Michael.</i>

36:27.977 --> 36:28.853
<i>Um...</i>

36:29.479 --> 36:31.398
<i>The... I want to...</i>

36:32.232 --> 36:33.942
<i>do some, um...</i>

36:36.361 --> 36:38.571
<i>I want to honor a movie</i>
<i>called </i>Death Punch.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.323
<i>It's my favorite movie in the world.</i>

36:40.407 --> 36:42.033
<i>Nobody watches it.</i>

36:42.117 --> 36:44.744
<i>We're always trying to get people</i>
<i>to watch it, and they don't.</i>

36:44.828 --> 36:48.581
<i>Um, it's hard to find,</i>
<i>but it's very important to me.</i>

36:49.290 --> 36:51.084
<i>Uh, so...</i>

36:52.419 --> 36:54.421
<i>Yeah. </i>Death Punch.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.303
The movie begins on Chien,

37:03.138 --> 37:05.432
a young kung fu student...

37:06.182 --> 37:08.601
in the mountains. His moves
are graceful and powerful,

37:08.685 --> 37:10.270
but something's missing.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.980
He's not yet complete.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.775
He's attacked by the Master Liu.

37:15.859 --> 37:18.737
And a great battle ensues and...

37:18.820 --> 37:23.158
And Liu winds up for what will
become known as the Death Punch.

37:27.871 --> 37:28.872
And...

37:30.290 --> 37:31.207
He strikes.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.294
But what happens is...

37:35.003 --> 37:36.337
he actually misses...

37:36.796 --> 37:39.466
Chien and he hits the barrel because...

37:41.259 --> 37:43.928
Sorry, I told it wrong.
I shouldn't have...

37:45.346 --> 37:48.016
They're the master-and-student
relationship,

37:48.099 --> 37:49.350
but you think they're enemies

37:49.434 --> 37:51.311
and that's why it's funny
when he hits the barrel

37:51.394 --> 37:53.897
because you think that it's, um...

37:53.980 --> 37:56.316
I kind of messed that up, sorry.
But back to the story.

37:56.399 --> 38:00.612
The water starts to jiggle,
and Chien sees it and he says,

38:00.695 --> 38:04.699
"That's the fear of..." Um...

38:07.160 --> 38:10.538
But, anyhow, this is kind of where
you have to see the movie.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.706
Sorry. Um...

38:11.790 --> 38:14.793
Anyway, it's a cool shot
because the barrel starts to shake, right?

38:14.876 --> 38:17.170
It's rumbling. It's going crazy and...

38:17.962 --> 38:18.797
it's...

38:18.880 --> 38:20.423
[rumbles]

38:32.393 --> 38:35.313
And suddenly,
the barrel explodes with water.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.609
Oh! He's soaked.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.655
If I had landed that punch,
your fate would have been sealed.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.116
Three steps in any direction,
and your heart would explode.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.494
And then you'd be dead.

38:49.577 --> 38:54.541
Chien, he's stubborn and he learns
the Death Punch anyway, by himself.

38:54.624 --> 38:57.877
Alone he learns it.
On the hill without a shirt on.

38:57.961 --> 39:00.171
-Yeah, that part where he trains.
-[Andy] Right.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.798
-[Michael] But then...
-The ninjas come.

39:01.881 --> 39:05.343
Ku Woo Tai shows up with 15 ninjas.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.178
-Exactly 15.
-Exactly 15 ninjas.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.680
Yes, and put him in a chokehold.

39:09.222 --> 39:10.223
Ready?

39:10.306 --> 39:12.016
[Michael]
Here you go. You avoid it.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.685
Then he goes, no.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.770
[groans]

39:16.354 --> 39:18.064
Oh, it burns.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.108
[groans]

39:20.191 --> 39:22.610
-What have I done?
-Do you see what happens?

39:28.366 --> 39:29.784
[Michael exhales heavily]

39:32.036 --> 39:33.621
I think we're this way.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.747
Over here.

39:37.292 --> 39:38.209
What time is it?

39:40.003 --> 39:42.338
Eleven. Almost eleven.

39:46.009 --> 39:48.344
-It's closed.
-Yeah, it's closed.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.389
Closes at ten.

39:53.892 --> 39:54.767
What?

39:56.144 --> 39:57.061
Yeah?

39:58.187 --> 39:59.063
Yeah?

40:00.565 --> 40:01.608
I'll fucking do it.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.693
[both groan]

40:03.776 --> 40:05.570
-That's hot.
-I love it.

40:06.362 --> 40:07.405
I love it.

40:07.488 --> 40:09.657
-[Michael] Woo-hoo.
-[chuckles]

40:13.119 --> 40:15.955
Smells though, right?
Does it smell a little? Like meat.

40:16.456 --> 40:17.707
What do you mean you smell meat?

40:18.458 --> 40:19.417
You don't get that?

40:20.209 --> 40:22.629
-We're in a pot like soup.
-I don't smell it.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.088
[Michael]
Like people soup.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.465
Let's get some people in here.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.385
I'm gonna go to the bar.
I'm gonna get the open-mic girl,

40:30.136 --> 40:31.262
and I'm gonna get David.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.056
-Oh, no.
-Go get your friend David.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.766
[Andy]
You're not gonna get David.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.226
I almost killed that guy,
and he said, uh...

40:37.310 --> 40:39.228
I'm sorry, I was just trying to...

40:39.312 --> 40:41.773
-Oh, it's not your fault.
-No, I was, you know...

40:43.274 --> 40:44.442
What?

40:44.525 --> 40:45.735
[gate opens]

40:45.818 --> 40:47.695
Oh, shit. The lady's here.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.031
Duck. Duck, duck, duck.
Get under water.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.074
Hey, guys.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.493
-Hi.
-The pool's closed.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.744
-Closed at nine.
-All right.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.829
Sorry, we're gonna get out.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.331
-Yeah, are you drinking?
-Okay.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.166
-Don't come over.
-That's against the rules.

41:00.249 --> 41:02.293
No, we're... You don't want to see...

41:02.377 --> 41:04.462
-I'm getting in.
-No.

41:04.545 --> 41:05.588
-No.
-What?

41:06.005 --> 41:08.007
Is three company?
[laughs]

41:18.309 --> 41:20.645
[receptionist] You guys are so adorable.
You know that?

41:22.188 --> 41:25.733
I mean, like from the very first moment,

41:25.817 --> 41:29.946
when you checked in, we could really feel
that you were totally in love.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.031
It's really sweet.

41:32.949 --> 41:33.992
Oh, no.

41:34.575 --> 41:35.743
It's beautiful.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.371
-We're just...
-We're not...

41:38.454 --> 41:39.914
We're friends, right?

41:39.998 --> 41:41.666
We're not that way. We're...

41:42.375 --> 41:44.669
-We love those guys.
-Everybody's beautiful.

41:44.752 --> 41:47.630
-[Michael] We're neighbors. So...
-[Andy] We're just neighbors.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.048
But everything's okay

41:49.132 --> 41:50.883
-with the rest of the world.
-And it's great.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.553
It was such a strong thing
that we just assumed.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.346
-I'm sorry.
-Who is that?

41:55.430 --> 41:56.764
"We"? Who's "we"?

41:56.848 --> 41:58.391
Oh, me and my husband.

41:59.600 --> 42:04.105
Oh, so we... Okay, we're not
wearing clothes, so we're...

42:04.188 --> 42:06.941
He got naked so I got naked.
That's the only reason I got naked.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.193
-Where is he?
-He's right here.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.238
-What do you mean?
-What do you mean he's right here?

42:12.321 --> 42:14.323
-He's all around here.
-Wait a minute.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.075
He's not like invisible, right?

42:16.617 --> 42:18.036
-No.
-Don't say that.

42:18.119 --> 42:20.705
He passed away a few years ago.

42:21.748 --> 42:22.707
Oh.

42:22.790 --> 42:27.462
Yeah. We ran this place together
for a long time, and he's here.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.089
So, I'm here with him.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.639
I'm so sorry.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.725
I just blurted out, like...

42:43.644 --> 42:47.273
Sorry, I'm just bad at small talk.
I've never been good at it.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.861
-I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.
-I hate it.

42:52.779 --> 42:54.447
I hate small talk.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.992
I work in an office,
and that's all they do.

42:58.076 --> 43:00.703
-Yeah. I don't like it.
-[receptionist] So stupid, right?

43:00.787 --> 43:05.416
I keep trying to think of some kind of
better opening conversation line.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.002
I've been worrying about
how to really do it. Something like...

43:08.086 --> 43:12.006
You want to talk? If you don't, it's okay.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.466
-[chuckles]
-[receptionist laughs]

43:13.549 --> 43:15.343
Well, yeah. Or like...

43:17.345 --> 43:18.471
I see you.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.057
And now I'm gonna go over here.

43:21.557 --> 43:22.433
Right?

43:23.893 --> 43:26.145
[laughs] You're so cute.

43:26.229 --> 43:28.397
All right, I'm gonna hit the hay, guys.

43:28.481 --> 43:30.149
-[receptionist] No.
-Where you going?

43:30.233 --> 43:32.151
-We just got started...
-I gotta get some rest.

43:32.235 --> 43:34.153
Okay, well, we have to go.

43:34.237 --> 43:37.323
-You don't have to come. You can stay.
-No, I'm gonna go.

43:37.406 --> 43:39.700
-I'm gonna go, too.
-I'm just gonna go sleep in the room.

43:39.784 --> 43:41.994
-You have to be quiet.
-[receptionist] You go.

43:43.913 --> 43:44.831
You stay.

43:46.332 --> 43:48.292
-Yeah, I'm gonna go.
-No, Mike.

43:49.043 --> 43:50.795
Oh! Oh, Jesus.

43:52.380 --> 43:53.673
Oh.

43:55.758 --> 43:58.344
I don't have a key, though.
I don't have a key.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.221
It's okay. I got a lot of keys.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.598
You got a lot of them in the...

44:02.682 --> 44:03.516
Yeah, but...

44:04.684 --> 44:05.685
All right.

44:09.021 --> 44:11.023
Mm-hmm.

44:13.609 --> 44:14.735
[laughs]

44:15.611 --> 44:16.571
That's cute.

44:17.363 --> 44:18.406
[groans]

44:18.489 --> 44:20.199
Yeah, you... [laughs]

44:20.283 --> 44:23.494
-I was wrong.
-I'm sorry for that.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.586
Okay.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.262
What about him?

44:42.930 --> 44:45.892
'Cause we're over here
and he's over there, right? [chuckles]

44:46.559 --> 44:48.895
Yeah, well, he's always with me.

44:50.021 --> 44:50.855
But...

44:51.397 --> 44:52.690
he's also gone.

45:18.507 --> 45:21.093
-No.
-No, it's okay. It's all right.

46:31.872 --> 46:32.790
Hey, Michael.

46:34.709 --> 46:35.626
Michael.

46:41.424 --> 46:42.383
Hey, Michael.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.635
Michael. Hey, Michael.

46:52.852 --> 46:53.728
Hey, Michael.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.479
[Michael screams]

46:55.563 --> 46:57.565
[screams and burps]

46:58.983 --> 47:00.985
-Why'd you wake me up?
-Why are you screaming?

47:01.444 --> 47:02.695
[Andy] You scared me.

47:03.696 --> 47:04.697
I scared you?

47:05.197 --> 47:06.490
You looked like you were dead.

47:07.616 --> 47:08.659
You thought...

47:10.494 --> 47:11.662
I couldn't see you breathing.

47:14.290 --> 47:16.083
-[Michael sighs] Hey.
-Sorry.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.461
-How'd it go?
-What?

47:18.919 --> 47:19.920
[Andy] In the hot tub?

47:22.715 --> 47:23.632
Hmm.

47:27.303 --> 47:28.471
Ah, come on.

47:30.806 --> 47:32.391
[sighs] It was fun, though.

47:35.436 --> 47:36.395
What?

47:37.104 --> 47:38.272
Nothing?

47:38.856 --> 47:40.399
Good night. Uh-oh.

47:40.483 --> 47:42.193
Good night. Uh-oh.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.278
Good night.

47:48.366 --> 47:51.035
[Andy] Hey, Michael,
I need an aspirin or something.

47:52.661 --> 47:54.914
My head. I got...
I was a little drunk.

47:56.290 --> 47:57.208
Hey.

48:22.441 --> 48:23.442
Michael!

48:51.053 --> 48:52.096
Michael!

49:13.242 --> 49:14.452
[Andy]
<i>Excuse me, miss.</i>

49:14.535 --> 49:16.579
-Did you see the guy--
-[Michael] Hey, good morning.

49:17.663 --> 49:18.539
[Andy]
Hey.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.209
What are you... You're over here?

49:23.419 --> 49:25.963
Yeah. I was looking at the fire.
I was waiting for you to get up.

49:26.046 --> 49:28.966
-I thought we'd get some pancakes.
-Oh, you're watching the fire?

49:29.049 --> 49:30.843
Yeah, you ever just watch a fire?

49:30.926 --> 49:33.220
-So nice.
-Yeah. You should've woke me though.

49:33.304 --> 49:34.180
What?

49:34.889 --> 49:36.974
-You okay? What's wrong with you?
-All right. Whatever.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.726
I'm all right. I'm hungry, that's all.

49:40.186 --> 49:41.270
What do you want to do?

49:43.022 --> 49:44.273
Why are you sweating?

49:44.773 --> 49:47.193
I went outside.
I thought you were down there.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.695
I went down the block. I saw...

49:50.362 --> 49:51.572
[breathes heavily]

49:51.655 --> 49:53.282
I saw a bunch of people, you know?

49:54.325 --> 49:55.659
Want to do the pancakes?

49:57.244 --> 49:58.078
Yeah.

49:59.163 --> 50:01.665
-All right. Let me go to the room.
-I want pancakes. All right.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.712
Andy, what are you doing?

50:07.671 --> 50:09.507
What do you mean, "What're you doing"?

50:09.590 --> 50:10.758
I just got to...

50:12.468 --> 50:13.719
wash up or something.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.722
[sighs]
What's the matter?

50:19.266 --> 50:20.893
You know, you keep...

50:21.936 --> 50:22.853
What?

50:23.479 --> 50:25.231
-What about it?
-You keep taking it.

50:25.940 --> 50:26.815
Well...

50:27.441 --> 50:28.442
first of all,

50:29.652 --> 50:30.819
I'm taking it back.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.280
-You took it this morning.
-That's mine.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.573
No, it isn't yours.

50:34.657 --> 50:35.866
Because I bought it.

50:35.950 --> 50:37.326
All right? I bought it.

50:37.409 --> 50:40.246
You bought the safe,
but the medication is mine.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.790
-No, I bought the medication, too.
-That's the important part.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.500
-Right?
-You did not buy the medication.

50:44.583 --> 50:46.043
-I didn't say...
-You tried to buy it.

50:46.126 --> 50:48.128
-I swiped the card.
-I didn't say I'm paying for it?

50:48.212 --> 50:50.005
-You said you were.
-We have a witness.

50:50.089 --> 50:51.549
You said it. But I'm the one whose...

50:51.632 --> 50:53.467
-Whose bank account got charged?
-Oh, so I lied?

50:53.551 --> 50:55.427
I'm paying for it. It's mine.

50:56.011 --> 50:57.471
-It's mine.
-Just give it to me.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.807
-We don't have--
-What are you doing?

51:00.224 --> 51:01.934
I'm gonna hold it, that's all.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.727
You're running away from me?
Give me the...

51:03.811 --> 51:05.479
What, are you chasing me?
You're chasing me.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.022
I'm not chasing you. You're walking.

51:07.106 --> 51:09.775
Stop moving around the table.
Stop moving.

51:09.858 --> 51:10.985
Just stop it, all right?

51:11.068 --> 51:13.821
-I'm not--
-Stop it. This is stupid.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.323
I got the bad knee.
You know I got the bad knee.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.242
You know I'm gonna catch you
if you want me to.

51:18.325 --> 51:19.243
[Andy]
You better stop.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.288
-Andy! Andy!
-I'll tell you right now, I won't stop.

51:22.997 --> 51:24.873
[breathes heavily]

51:24.957 --> 51:26.709
-I'm holding it.
-[Michael] Look at me.

51:29.003 --> 51:30.045
That's mine.

51:31.589 --> 51:33.048
[Andy exhales]

51:33.132 --> 51:34.508
-I want it.
-Okay.

51:36.176 --> 51:38.345
Um, maybe it is yours.

51:38.846 --> 51:40.097
I need to hold it.

51:40.889 --> 51:41.890
All right?

51:42.933 --> 51:45.227
I don't know why you're making
a big deal out of it.

51:48.731 --> 51:50.274
Because I'm the dying guy.

51:56.530 --> 51:58.616
-I'm the dying guy.
-Okay. All right.

51:59.366 --> 52:00.492
You can't keep saying that.

52:01.076 --> 52:02.536
But you keep taking that.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.913
-I'm the dying guy.
-Shut up with that.

52:04.997 --> 52:06.081
Then give me the safe.

52:06.165 --> 52:09.501
-You're being a stupid idiot.
-I'm being stupid? I'm the dying guy.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.128
-Shut up!
-I'm the dying guy.

52:11.211 --> 52:13.339
-I know you're the dying guy. Stop.
-I'm the dying guy!

52:13.422 --> 52:15.215
I'm the other guy!

53:56.608 --> 53:58.152
[exhales]

54:06.452 --> 54:07.494
[safe thuds]

54:52.206 --> 54:53.707
There's 32 dogs.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.126
Twenty ate cats.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.546
How many didn't?

55:08.972 --> 55:10.599
[Michael softly]
...two dogs and 20...

55:21.902 --> 55:24.404
Thirty-two dogs. Twenty of them ate cats.

55:25.864 --> 55:26.865
It's 12.

55:29.159 --> 55:30.994
That was easy.
[chuckles]

55:32.371 --> 55:33.580
I'm so smart.

55:34.623 --> 55:35.874
[Andy]
One, two, three, four.

55:36.542 --> 55:37.876
That's not the code.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.086
Yeah.

55:39.628 --> 55:42.840
-The code is one, two, three, four?
-See? You're not that smart.

55:43.423 --> 55:44.424
Should've got it.

55:44.508 --> 55:46.635
[laughs] How?

55:49.888 --> 55:50.806
[Andy] I can't...

55:53.600 --> 55:55.143
I can't be normal...

55:56.186 --> 55:58.397
through all of this. I just can't.

56:06.613 --> 56:08.448
[sighs]

56:11.201 --> 56:12.077
Okay.

56:20.085 --> 56:21.003
All right.

56:21.795 --> 56:24.631
[grunts]
Your stove is still acting stupid.

56:25.883 --> 56:29.344
I think I might have burnt it a little
on the bottom, but I think it's okay.

56:34.224 --> 56:35.392
They're still fighting here?

56:35.475 --> 56:37.394
There's more fighting
in this than I remember.

56:41.189 --> 56:42.774
Your friend Dave would love it.

56:42.858 --> 56:44.067
[chuckles]

56:50.699 --> 56:51.742
It's gonna get cold.

56:52.868 --> 56:54.161
I'll get it in a sec.

56:55.871 --> 56:57.039
I can re-heat it.

57:00.375 --> 57:01.668
[Master Liu on TV]
<i>Tiger style.</i>

57:02.169 --> 57:04.004
<i>Chien, when you woke this morning,</i>

57:04.087 --> 57:06.173
<i>did you think it would be</i>
<i>for the last time?</i>

57:12.471 --> 57:13.388
Still got it.

57:13.472 --> 57:14.723
Mm-hmm.

57:20.354 --> 57:21.188
[Michael]
<i>Okay.</i>

57:21.939 --> 57:24.066
-[Andy] Can I open them?
-Biggest surprise of your life.

57:24.149 --> 57:26.318
-Ah!
-Happy birthday to you.

57:26.401 --> 57:28.403
Happy birthday to Andy.

57:28.487 --> 57:29.821
The cupcake...

57:29.905 --> 57:32.074
that I bought. Thank you.

57:32.658 --> 57:34.326
-All right.
-[Michael] Wish.

57:34.409 --> 57:35.369
Make a wish.

57:38.538 --> 57:40.374
You still got cancer
that's killing you?

57:41.541 --> 57:43.126
-I think so.
-Yeah.

57:43.752 --> 57:44.878
See? It never works.

57:45.796 --> 57:48.757
You should've gone with sand-off.
[grunts]

57:51.385 --> 57:52.552
You gonna have some?

57:53.428 --> 57:54.513
I don't think so.

57:55.263 --> 57:56.515
Doesn't smell like orange.

57:56.598 --> 57:57.641
[Michael groans]

58:04.690 --> 58:06.692
[retches and coughs]

58:09.152 --> 58:11.154
[spits and exhales]

58:14.700 --> 58:17.494
[breathes heavily]

58:17.577 --> 58:19.371
-You all right?
-Yeah.

58:20.414 --> 58:21.498
[exhales]

58:22.249 --> 58:23.750
Feels like there's a little more.

58:24.376 --> 58:25.794
-Really?
-It's like, just...

58:26.545 --> 58:27.546
I don't know.

58:28.380 --> 58:30.090
It doesn't all come, you know?

58:32.551 --> 58:34.553
-It feels better, though.
-Yeah.

58:35.679 --> 58:38.223
[laughs wryly] You don't have to
sit in here if you don't want to.

58:38.306 --> 58:39.224
No, it's...

58:39.307 --> 58:41.601
It sounded like you got
all of it out, though.

58:41.685 --> 58:46.273
[Michael retches and groans]

59:02.372 --> 59:03.832
It is <i>River Kickers.</i>

59:06.585 --> 59:07.669
They're scamming.

59:12.382 --> 59:13.633
You were right.

59:13.717 --> 59:16.595
The one from the gas station
is <i>River Kickers.</i>

59:18.180 --> 59:19.097
Michael.

59:22.976 --> 59:24.978
-Hey, Michael.
-Hmm? What?

59:28.273 --> 59:29.524
It's <i>River Kickers.</i>

[Chien breathes heavily]

[Liu groans]

1:00:01.264 --> 1:00:03.558
[Liu coughs]

1:00:07.521 --> 1:00:08.772
I think I'm ready.

1:00:13.026 --> 1:00:15.612
I want to go when I feel good.
I don't want to go when it's hurting.

1:00:15.695 --> 1:00:16.780
But you're feeling good.

1:00:16.863 --> 1:00:20.617
Yeah, but it's not gonna stay that way.
You know, I'd like to do it when I feel...

1:00:22.285 --> 1:00:23.870
I think I'm ready.

1:00:42.681 --> 1:00:45.600
I should have took off from work.
You know, I should have took off.

1:00:45.684 --> 1:00:47.644
A month ago.
We could've done more stuff.

1:00:48.895 --> 1:00:50.063
We could've done more stuff.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:53.775
I wish I had done that.

1:01:01.324 --> 1:01:02.909
Did you hear my speech?

1:01:02.993 --> 1:01:04.953
My half-time speech. Huh?

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:09.666
Let me guess, it's...

1:01:12.961 --> 1:01:14.546
-Guys...
-You're never gonna guess it.

1:01:14.629 --> 1:01:15.672
Guys, you...

1:01:16.173 --> 1:01:17.549
We're gonna lose, but...

1:01:18.216 --> 1:01:20.886
You know, go back...
Go forward in your life

1:01:20.969 --> 1:01:22.971
and imagine where you are
and if you had a chance--

1:01:23.054 --> 1:01:24.097
How do you know that?

1:01:26.808 --> 1:01:28.685
You're my best friend. I know you.

1:01:37.944 --> 1:01:41.281
Also, I heard you practicing it
through the vent about 100 times.

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:46.369
That fucking vent.
[chuckles]

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:52.834
You seem really good right now.
You know, you seem like...

1:01:55.253 --> 1:01:56.755
Maybe there's... I don't know.

1:01:59.216 --> 1:02:00.467
I know.

1:02:01.259 --> 1:02:02.802
-I'm ready.
-I know.

1:02:13.939 --> 1:02:15.941
-So, 100 of these suckers.
-Yeah.

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:20.946
I don't even know
if you had to buy this particular pill.

1:02:21.029 --> 1:02:23.281
A hundred of anything, really, would...

1:02:23.865 --> 1:02:24.824
would...

1:02:25.325 --> 1:02:26.409
You know?

1:02:28.119 --> 1:02:30.872
-[Michael] These are really hard to...
-Yeah.

1:02:31.373 --> 1:02:32.582
I wonder if they do that...

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:34.209
on purpose, you know?

1:02:38.171 --> 1:02:39.714
You think anybody's ever died...

1:02:41.049 --> 1:02:44.094
[chuckles]
while they were emptying these?

1:02:44.719 --> 1:02:47.013
-You're spilling it on the side now.
-Oh, sorry.

1:02:47.097 --> 1:02:48.723
Well, you spilled it now.

1:02:48.807 --> 1:02:51.810
Well, sorry. We got to go back now, right?

1:03:03.655 --> 1:03:05.031
I was married once.

1:03:07.617 --> 1:03:08.910
-Are you kidding me?
-Uh-uh.

1:03:09.869 --> 1:03:12.372
-You never told me that?
-I never told anybody that.

1:03:12.455 --> 1:03:13.498
Why didn't you tell me?

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:15.959
[sighs deeply]

1:03:16.042 --> 1:03:17.002
How long?

1:03:18.420 --> 1:03:20.714
-Year and a half.
-Yeah?

1:03:22.299 --> 1:03:24.301
I used to feel so bad about it.

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:27.470
I really...

1:03:28.722 --> 1:03:30.181
I thought I wanted that...

1:03:31.224 --> 1:03:32.767
that life. I really...

1:03:34.978 --> 1:03:36.104
And I was...

1:03:39.607 --> 1:03:42.152
I left her. It was awful.

1:03:44.654 --> 1:03:46.114
And then I thought...

1:03:47.198 --> 1:03:48.908
"Oh, I know I need to be alone.

1:03:48.992 --> 1:03:51.911
I'm convinced. That's what I need to do.
I need to be alone."

1:03:51.995 --> 1:03:53.538
I thought that for sure.

1:03:54.831 --> 1:03:55.957
[sighs]

1:03:56.916 --> 1:03:58.418
And then I ended up here...

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:01.880
with you.

1:04:05.050 --> 1:04:06.092
And I knew.

1:04:08.178 --> 1:04:09.554
Like, "This is my spot.

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:13.433
This is where I belong."

1:04:15.435 --> 1:04:16.394
Hmm.

1:04:21.441 --> 1:04:22.942
When you first came...

1:04:24.527 --> 1:04:27.280
and you were looking at this apartment

1:04:27.364 --> 1:04:29.282
-when Barry was showing it to you...
-Yeah.

1:04:29.866 --> 1:04:30.784
...I saw you.

1:04:32.452 --> 1:04:34.162
Yeah, I didn't want you to get it.

1:04:35.705 --> 1:04:37.123
I know, you looked...

1:04:38.208 --> 1:04:39.250
You look weird.

1:04:39.334 --> 1:04:40.460
[chuckles]

1:04:40.543 --> 1:04:43.963
Yeah, I mean, I didn't know you were
gonna be a cool guy and everything.

1:04:45.673 --> 1:04:47.550
I told Barry you look like
one of those guys...

1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:51.513
you know, you see on he news.
He's got a...

1:04:52.138 --> 1:04:54.641
He's got a freezer full of hands and feet.

1:04:56.101 --> 1:04:58.770
I told Barry, I said,
"Eh, why don't you keep looking?"

1:05:01.272 --> 1:05:03.149
Yeah. [chuckles]

1:05:04.651 --> 1:05:05.693
It's all right.

1:05:05.777 --> 1:05:07.904
I've seen people
look at me like that in...

1:05:07.987 --> 1:05:09.072
a Rite Aid or something.

1:05:09.155 --> 1:05:11.866
-People look at me like that all the time.
-Yeah.

1:05:14.119 --> 1:05:16.579
Oh, God. We gotta deal with this.

1:05:17.956 --> 1:05:18.915
Oh.

1:05:21.835 --> 1:05:23.461
I mean, it's now or never, so...

1:05:24.003 --> 1:05:25.672
I'll just tell you if you want.

1:05:27.674 --> 1:05:29.676
I don't think
you're gonna like it though.

1:05:30.301 --> 1:05:31.803
-You never know.
-I hope you do.

1:05:31.886 --> 1:05:33.680
-It's "fatty pork."
-No, it's not "fatty pork."

1:05:33.763 --> 1:05:35.515
-It's "fatty pork."
-It's not "fatty pork."

1:05:35.598 --> 1:05:36.766
What is it?

1:05:36.850 --> 1:05:37.892
It's nothing.

1:05:37.976 --> 1:05:39.519
Wait.

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:41.438
Yeah, I did that.

1:05:41.521 --> 1:05:43.148
There's no answer?

1:05:43.231 --> 1:05:44.315
No, there's no answer,

1:05:44.399 --> 1:05:45.775
-but I have a reason.
-Two years?

1:05:45.859 --> 1:05:48.528
-Why would you do that to me?
-Because when we do puzzles...

1:05:49.404 --> 1:05:51.990
it's a lot of work and...

1:05:52.073 --> 1:05:53.575
it's hard, but it's fun.

1:05:53.658 --> 1:05:56.161
And there's a finish.
There's something real you can finish.

1:05:56.244 --> 1:05:58.663
I know, but you always look sad
when we'd finish.

1:05:58.746 --> 1:06:00.874
-I don't look sad. No, I don't.
-You always look a little sad.

1:06:00.957 --> 1:06:02.709
You don't see it. I see it.

1:06:03.918 --> 1:06:06.004
We're happy, we're done, we got it.

1:06:08.047 --> 1:06:11.092
And then you get a little sad.
I thought, "You know what?

1:06:11.801 --> 1:06:12.886
He'll never get it.

1:06:14.095 --> 1:06:15.555
He'll never get this shirt.

1:06:16.306 --> 1:06:18.141
This will be his favorite shirt."

1:06:20.310 --> 1:06:22.312
[chuckles]

1:06:27.525 --> 1:06:29.527
-Got any other confessions?
-No.

1:06:30.278 --> 1:06:32.489
I thought you were a killer. I...

1:06:33.031 --> 1:06:34.699
gave you a shirt with no answer.

1:06:36.493 --> 1:06:38.161
That's it. I'm clean now.

1:06:38.244 --> 1:06:39.954
Come on, that's the last one. We got to...

1:06:46.169 --> 1:06:47.587
[Michael sighs]
All right.

1:06:50.715 --> 1:06:52.133
What's the next step?

1:06:57.847 --> 1:07:00.433
"Fill the glass
with four ounces of water."

1:07:02.852 --> 1:07:04.521
That's the lethal dose.

1:07:04.604 --> 1:07:05.730
And you dilute it.

1:07:05.813 --> 1:07:06.898
[Michael]
Hmm.

1:07:06.981 --> 1:07:09.567
It's bitter, so you're gonna
drink it all at once.

1:07:10.401 --> 1:07:12.403
[Michael groans]

1:07:14.113 --> 1:07:15.156
Okay.

1:07:17.492 --> 1:07:18.535
[Andy]
And then...

1:07:19.661 --> 1:07:21.079
in a few minutes,

1:07:21.162 --> 1:07:22.872
-you fall asleep.
-Yeah.

1:07:23.748 --> 1:07:26.918
-And then a few minutes later...
-I remember that part.

1:07:27.001 --> 1:07:28.127
Then there's, um...

1:07:30.421 --> 1:07:33.466
The yellow one is for anti-vomiting.

1:07:34.175 --> 1:07:38.179
That's the thing. If you vomit
this up then it's all for nothing.

1:07:38.972 --> 1:07:40.682
This is for anti-anxiety.

1:07:40.765 --> 1:07:42.016
If you take it and then...

1:07:42.100 --> 1:07:44.269
I don't want that.
I want to be in my head.

1:07:44.811 --> 1:07:47.313
-All right, I'll keep this.
-I don't need that but I'll take this.

1:07:48.982 --> 1:07:49.899
All right.

1:07:51.276 --> 1:07:54.070
Takes an hour. After you take that pill...

1:07:54.153 --> 1:07:55.530
I got to wait an hour after?

1:07:55.613 --> 1:07:58.032
You got to wait an hour
for that to take effect, yeah.

1:07:58.658 --> 1:08:00.076
All right, we should have taken...

1:08:00.159 --> 1:08:02.453
[Andy]
Let me go... Hold on. Hold on.

1:08:02.537 --> 1:08:04.289
-Go ahead.
-Tell me when you swallow it.

1:08:04.914 --> 1:08:06.207
[watch beeps]

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:07.250
Okay.

1:08:08.376 --> 1:08:10.378
Now, so we just wait an hour?

1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:12.338
Hmm. You got to wait an hour.

1:08:15.258 --> 1:08:17.260
Yeah, you should feel free
to sell the car.

1:08:17.343 --> 1:08:18.928
[sighs]

1:08:19.012 --> 1:08:20.013
Yeah, maybe.

1:08:20.847 --> 1:08:22.849
I don't think
you should be driving, anyway.

1:08:24.309 --> 1:08:26.769
I do think you should keep
my phone though.

1:08:26.853 --> 1:08:27.854
Nah.

1:08:28.646 --> 1:08:30.648
-Nah, I don't want it.
-What do you mean, "nah"?

1:08:30.732 --> 1:08:32.734
Don't you think it's time
you get a phone?

1:08:34.652 --> 1:08:36.112
Yeah, I'll get one.

1:08:36.529 --> 1:08:38.114
I don't want yours.

1:08:39.949 --> 1:08:42.243
You don't get e-mail right?
You can't get e-mail on it.

1:08:42.910 --> 1:08:44.078
[Michael]
Nothing wrong with my phone.

1:08:44.162 --> 1:08:46.706
[Andy] There's nothing wrong.
I'll keep it. I just want a good one.

1:08:46.789 --> 1:08:49.000
[Michael] You don't even know
how to do e-mail on a phone.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:51.502
-You don't know what you're doing.
-It comes with instructions, right?

1:08:51.586 --> 1:08:52.503
[Michael]
Yes.

1:08:52.587 --> 1:08:54.297
-Yeah, don't do that.
-What?

1:08:54.922 --> 1:08:56.924
-What are you doing?
-I'm smelling a tree.

1:08:57.008 --> 1:08:59.260
-I haven't smelled it before.
-There's bugs.

1:08:59.344 --> 1:09:01.346
What's it gonna do to me now?

1:09:02.305 --> 1:09:05.141
I don't know. There's a lot of larvae
and stuff on there.

1:09:09.020 --> 1:09:11.606
There's something I do want
to talk to you about that...

1:09:13.524 --> 1:09:14.901
I don't think you're gonna like...

1:09:16.277 --> 1:09:17.195
[Michael sniffs]

1:09:17.820 --> 1:09:18.738
What?

1:09:19.489 --> 1:09:20.365
[Michael sighs]

1:09:22.742 --> 1:09:24.243
I don't believe...

1:09:27.038 --> 1:09:29.040
but if there's an after...

1:09:31.167 --> 1:09:32.543
situation...

1:09:35.755 --> 1:09:40.343
and I could somehow contact you...

1:09:41.469 --> 1:09:46.724
You know, like the woman in the hotel.
She hangs out with her husband, you know.

1:09:46.808 --> 1:09:50.228
She's saying what she feels.
You don't mean real. I mean, that's...

1:09:51.688 --> 1:09:55.316
-That's just in movies and stuff, right?
-But on the...

1:09:55.400 --> 1:09:59.320
.001 chance...

1:10:00.530 --> 1:10:02.240
would you want me to...

1:10:04.784 --> 1:10:05.910
contact you?

1:10:10.665 --> 1:10:11.833
This is...

1:10:11.916 --> 1:10:13.668
This is a tough one for me.

1:10:13.751 --> 1:10:15.503
-I don't know.
-I could send you a signal.

1:10:16.462 --> 1:10:17.755
-Yeah.
-You know?

1:10:19.549 --> 1:10:21.551
Push the water glass a little bit or...

1:10:22.385 --> 1:10:26.806
-leave you a note in the foggy mirror...
-No. No, don't do that.

1:10:26.889 --> 1:10:28.391
No, no. Do not do that.

1:10:29.934 --> 1:10:32.311
Nothing sudden or, you know...

1:10:33.521 --> 1:10:34.689
Nothing at midnight.

1:10:34.772 --> 1:10:35.648
Yeah.

1:10:36.482 --> 1:10:39.068
No moaning through the vent.
No, "woo."

1:10:40.153 --> 1:10:41.404
Although now...

1:10:43.156 --> 1:10:44.073
What?

1:10:44.157 --> 1:10:47.368
You know, you did now.
Now I'm just gonna think anything weird...

1:10:48.828 --> 1:10:51.748
I'm gonna think it's you.
The wind, it's you.

1:10:51.831 --> 1:10:54.041
The light flickers, it's you.

1:10:54.625 --> 1:10:58.337
Let's just pick something right now,
so I know everything else...

1:10:58.421 --> 1:11:01.299
That's what I was getting at
in the first...

1:11:01.382 --> 1:11:05.136
[watch beeps]

1:11:34.832 --> 1:11:36.834
[door opens]

1:11:39.796 --> 1:11:41.297
Oh...

1:11:46.385 --> 1:11:47.345
I'm winded.

1:11:51.390 --> 1:11:53.267
[sighs deeply]

1:12:04.237 --> 1:12:05.655
I just realized something.

1:12:08.324 --> 1:12:09.700
I never talked about...

1:12:10.326 --> 1:12:11.577
where.

1:12:12.286 --> 1:12:13.788
Yeah, no. We didn't.

1:12:15.540 --> 1:12:16.874
I guess you could just...

1:12:17.458 --> 1:12:19.377
-There's no instructions.
-No.

1:12:23.965 --> 1:12:27.468
I guess we could do it on the couch.
I mean, I'm here.

1:12:28.511 --> 1:12:29.554
Yeah.

1:12:29.637 --> 1:12:31.305
I mean, that makes sense, right?

1:12:32.265 --> 1:12:33.224
It's, uh...

1:12:34.350 --> 1:12:36.143
-It's our spot.
-It's our place, right? Yeah.

1:12:39.981 --> 1:12:41.357
I don't want to do it on the couch.

1:12:41.482 --> 1:12:43.192
All right. Okay.

1:12:47.989 --> 1:12:50.241
If I was on the floor,
I'd be closer to the door.

1:12:50.324 --> 1:12:52.577
-For when...
-If that's what you want.

1:12:54.328 --> 1:12:55.454
I took, you know...

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:01.252
I don't want to do it on the floor.

1:13:01.752 --> 1:13:02.920
All right.

1:13:03.004 --> 1:13:03.880
Okay.

1:13:05.506 --> 1:13:07.008
Uh...

1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:10.970
Um...

1:13:13.890 --> 1:13:15.933
-Hmm? You all right?
-Yeah.

1:13:17.518 --> 1:13:18.978
You all right? You want me to...

1:13:27.778 --> 1:13:29.405
I want to do it in here.

1:13:29.488 --> 1:13:30.781
-On the bed.
-Okay.

1:13:31.282 --> 1:13:32.867
-All right.
-Can you get the drink?

1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:35.578
Yeah, okay.

1:15:23.144 --> 1:15:24.103
If you feel...

1:15:28.107 --> 1:15:29.400
It's okay.

1:15:43.330 --> 1:15:44.331
[mumbles]

1:15:44.999 --> 1:15:48.669
[breathes heavily]

1:16:07.104 --> 1:16:08.105
Wanna lay down?

1:16:08.689 --> 1:16:09.565
Yeah.

1:16:09.648 --> 1:16:11.150
-Should I lay down?
-You wanna lay down?

1:16:11.233 --> 1:16:13.235
Okay. Yeah.

1:16:13.319 --> 1:16:15.404
[Michael breathes heavily]

1:16:17.114 --> 1:16:19.325
Okay. All right. Okay.

1:16:20.201 --> 1:16:21.243
Okay.

1:16:22.495 --> 1:16:25.915
[breathes heavily]

1:16:29.543 --> 1:16:30.628
What?

1:16:30.711 --> 1:16:34.006
I'm starting to...
I'm shaking a little bit.

1:16:34.090 --> 1:16:35.716
It's okay. It's, uh...

1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:41.722
I'm getting a little scared.

1:16:41.806 --> 1:16:44.809
Yeah, you don't have to be scared.
I think it's gonna be okay.

1:16:44.892 --> 1:16:46.352
I think everything's gonna be okay.

1:16:46.435 --> 1:16:50.106
-[cries] I'm scared.
-I don't think you gotta get scared, Mike.

1:16:51.232 --> 1:16:53.359
I think it's gonna be okay.

1:16:53.442 --> 1:16:55.152
[cries]
I shouldn't have taken the pill.

1:16:55.236 --> 1:16:56.153
I know.

1:16:57.571 --> 1:16:58.781
It's gonna be all right.

1:16:58.864 --> 1:17:00.324
[cries] Yeah, but you don't know.

1:17:00.407 --> 1:17:02.076
No, I do. I do.

1:17:03.077 --> 1:17:05.955
It's gonna be okay, Michael.

1:17:06.038 --> 1:17:06.956
Okay.

1:17:07.873 --> 1:17:09.083
It's okay, man.

1:17:09.166 --> 1:17:11.669
-It's gonna be okay. All right.
-[cries] Okay.

1:17:11.752 --> 1:17:13.003
I'm okay.

1:17:13.087 --> 1:17:16.006
[breathes heavily]

1:17:16.090 --> 1:17:16.924
Okay.

1:17:21.095 --> 1:17:22.388
[cries] You're doing good.

1:17:22.471 --> 1:17:24.932
Yeah, I know. 'Cause I know.
I got a feeling.

1:17:25.015 --> 1:17:27.143
I got a feeling, man.
I got a feeling about this.

1:17:27.226 --> 1:17:28.394
Give me your hand.

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:31.021
Oh, my God. I'm already--
Give me your hand. Hey.

1:17:32.690 --> 1:17:34.233
I want to tell you I love you.

1:17:35.109 --> 1:17:36.402
[exhales] Okay?

1:17:39.196 --> 1:17:41.157
Okay.

1:17:43.409 --> 1:17:44.285
Okay.

1:17:44.743 --> 1:17:46.412
-It's okay.
-Okay.

1:17:46.495 --> 1:17:48.038
I feel good.

1:17:48.122 --> 1:17:49.123
I feel okay.

1:17:49.206 --> 1:17:50.541
You're gonna be okay.

1:17:50.624 --> 1:17:51.750
-You know?
-Okay.

1:17:51.834 --> 1:17:52.960
It's okay, Michael.

1:17:53.043 --> 1:17:53.878
Hey...

1:17:54.545 --> 1:17:56.380
-Hey, Andy?
-Yeah?

1:17:57.256 --> 1:18:00.050
I'm gonna close my eyes now, okay?

1:18:00.134 --> 1:18:01.260
-Yeah?
-Okay?

1:18:02.636 --> 1:18:04.180
-Okay.
-All right.

1:18:04.763 --> 1:18:08.601
[exhales heavily]

1:18:11.312 --> 1:18:13.898
[breathes shakily]

1:18:26.619 --> 1:18:28.037
I love you, too, Michael.

1:18:34.585 --> 1:18:36.587
[Michael exhales heavily]

1:18:37.504 --> 1:18:38.631
[Andy sniffles]

1:21:19.875 --> 1:21:21.085
[Chien on TV]
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1:21:22.878 --> 1:21:25.255
[Liu gasps and groans]

1:21:33.639 --> 1:21:35.974
[Liu groans]

1:21:56.829 --> 1:21:58.455
<i>See you down the road, friend.</i>

1:22:29.862 --> 1:22:31.071
You in C?

1:22:33.073 --> 1:22:35.617
Uh, yeah. We're moving into C.

1:22:40.998 --> 1:22:42.541
I'm going over there so...

1:22:43.792 --> 1:22:44.751
Thank you.

1:22:44.835 --> 1:22:45.961
[Andy]
Uh-huh.

1:22:48.839 --> 1:22:51.717
-[woman] So you are in what apartment?
-[Andy] I'm in F.

1:22:52.593 --> 1:22:54.803
-F?
-Yeah, that's upstairs.

1:22:54.887 --> 1:22:56.513
-Oh, right above us.
-Uh-huh.

1:22:57.598 --> 1:22:58.474
Okay.

1:23:00.684 --> 1:23:03.395
-[woman] Hey, thank you so much.
-All right. Yeah.

1:23:09.026 --> 1:23:12.112
You got the best apartment, actually.

1:23:12.529 --> 1:23:14.740
Oh. You hear that? Best apartment.

1:23:17.451 --> 1:23:19.453
You're lucky, actually,
that you got this one.

1:23:28.086 --> 1:23:29.087
Is that you?

1:23:29.588 --> 1:23:30.797
It's Evan?

1:23:30.881 --> 1:23:32.758
You can answer him. Tell him.

1:23:34.259 --> 1:23:35.469
It's all right.

1:23:35.552 --> 1:23:37.554
He doesn't have to. I'm Andy.

1:23:38.972 --> 1:23:40.390
-Kiersten, hi.
-Okay.

1:23:42.684 --> 1:23:44.686
So, I guess you like games then,
Evan, huh?

1:23:44.770 --> 1:23:46.813
-Yeah.
-You ever play Paddleton?

1:23:47.272 --> 1:23:48.857
-Paddleton?
-Yeah.

1:23:49.483 --> 1:23:51.485
-No.
-No. 'Cause we made it up.

1:23:52.027 --> 1:23:53.737
-Yeah.
-How do you play?

1:23:53.820 --> 1:23:56.156
Like, it's like paddle ball,

1:23:56.240 --> 1:23:59.409
but you gotta imagine
this whole wall here, right?

1:23:59.493 --> 1:24:00.827
You hit a ball against it.

1:24:01.411 --> 1:24:04.081
And you got to get it into a barrel
that's over here.

1:24:04.164 --> 1:24:05.707
We put a barrel right there.

1:24:05.791 --> 1:24:08.669
And, uh, it doesn't sound
like a lot of fun, but it is.

1:24:09.419 --> 1:24:11.838
It's good. It's fun. Yeah.
I'll show you one day.

1:24:12.464 --> 1:24:13.549
All right.

1:24:13.632 --> 1:24:14.758
[Kiersten] Thank you so much.

1:24:15.801 --> 1:24:17.469
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah, you too.

1:24:17.553 --> 1:24:19.972
I got a great
football half-time speech, too.

1:24:20.055 --> 1:24:21.431
-If you ever need it.
-Okay.

1:24:22.015 --> 1:24:23.267
Yeah. It's a good one.

1:24:27.813 --> 1:24:31.066
