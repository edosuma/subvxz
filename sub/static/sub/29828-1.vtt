[Jesper] <i>Letters.</i>

00:26.458 --> 00:28.791
<i>You don't really write many these days,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

00:29.291 --> 00:31.458
<i>But I bet there's one you never forget.</i>

00:31.958 --> 00:34.458
<i>Send it off to a certain plump guy</i>
<i>in a red suit</i>

00:34.541 --> 00:36.666
<i>and, provided</i>
<i>you've kept your act together</i>

00:36.750 --> 00:37.583
<i>more or less,</i>

00:38.083 --> 00:39.458
<i>he'll drop off a toy or two.</i>

00:40.041 --> 00:42.041
<i>And yet, no one seems to wonder</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:44.416
<i>how the whole thing</i>
<i>got started in the first place.</i>

00:45.625 --> 00:48.958
<i>This is a story about letters,</i>
<i>and it began...</i>

00:50.125 --> 00:51.125
<i>with this one.</i>

00:53.458 --> 00:55.375
[festive music plays]

[bell ringing]

-80!
-Drill Sergeant, sir!

01:38.791 --> 01:41.666
All the way from the top!
Dispatch for one of your cadets!

01:43.416 --> 01:45.208
It's for him, sir.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.250
[gasps]

01:46.333 --> 01:47.625
[growls]

01:54.041 --> 01:55.416
Cadet Johanssen!

01:55.500 --> 01:57.208
[sips] Mmm-mmm-mmm!

01:57.291 --> 01:58.208
Stop.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.416
Don't tell me. Let me try to guess.

02:01.250 --> 02:02.416
I give up. Who are you?

02:02.500 --> 02:03.375
Sarge!

02:03.458 --> 02:05.958
Drill Sarge! Have a seat.
Can I get you something to drink?

02:06.041 --> 02:07.125
An espresso? A cappuccino?

02:07.208 --> 02:10.458
Aren't you supposed to be
in equestrian training?

02:10.541 --> 02:11.416
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.750
No worries.
I've got someone covering for me.

02:17.833 --> 02:21.750
[groans] Dispatch
from the Postmaster General's Office!

02:21.833 --> 02:22.666
What?

02:22.750 --> 02:24.083
Sarge, is that for real?

02:24.166 --> 02:26.000
Don't tease me now. [chuckles]

02:26.083 --> 02:27.125
Here, hold these.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.916
Ah, well, I was expecting this
a little bit sooner,

02:31.000 --> 02:34.541
but, yup, summoned to the dragon's lair.

02:34.625 --> 02:37.875
Go ahead and cancel
the Drill Sergeant's espresso, actually.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.500
And, uh, here, why don't you finish mine?

02:39.583 --> 02:41.125
-I'm not gonna be needing it anymore...
-[growls]

02:41.208 --> 02:44.666
...and I'm gonna take one last look
around the old place so I can forget it.

02:44.750 --> 02:47.000
Mmm-hmm. Got it. All right, let's go.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.083
[growls]

02:50.250 --> 02:51.833
[Postmaster] Nine months.

02:52.666 --> 02:57.250
It's been nine months
since I used every ounce of my influence

02:57.333 --> 02:59.333
to get you into the Royal Postal Academy.

02:59.416 --> 03:02.708
Actually, nine months and six days,
but who's counting?

03:02.791 --> 03:04.333
What? No croutons?

03:04.416 --> 03:06.166
Oh, man, come on!

03:06.250 --> 03:08.500
Shall we take account
of your progress then?

03:08.583 --> 03:10.166
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Definitely.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.833
-Sergeant.
-[Drill Sergeant] Yes, sir!

03:11.916 --> 03:13.041
Sorting and filing:

03:14.791 --> 03:16.666

03:24.708 --> 03:26.583
<i>...worst on record.</i>

03:27.166 --> 03:28.125
Well, there you have it.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.833
But, hey, we gave it the old college try,
didn't we?

03:31.375 --> 03:34.041
Guess I'll just go pack up
and head home then. Too bad.

03:34.125 --> 03:35.333
Darn, oh, darn.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.333
-Stay right where you are.
-No, Dad!

03:37.458 --> 03:39.750
You're right. When will I grow up?

03:39.833 --> 03:43.041
When will I stop squandering
all these opportunities,

03:43.125 --> 03:45.250
which you so kindly forced me into,

03:45.333 --> 03:46.625
and become my own man?

03:46.708 --> 03:50.500
I guess I must really hanker down
and rethink my priorities.

03:50.583 --> 03:53.791
All wrapped up in my silk sheets
with some caviar and a sherry...

03:53.875 --> 03:55.083
You still buy the same brand, right?

03:55.166 --> 03:57.666
You think I'm just going to
watch you purposely fail

03:57.750 --> 03:59.708
and then let you waltz right back

03:59.791 --> 04:02.583
to a privileged life
void of any purpose or meaning?

04:02.666 --> 04:05.416
Well, yeah. Where else would I--

04:05.500 --> 04:09.291
Congratulations. You are now a postman.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.916
-[gasps]
-Come again?

04:11.000 --> 04:15.125
You are to establish
a working postal office in...

04:25.333 --> 04:27.083
Smeerensburg.

04:27.875 --> 04:28.916
You've got one year.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.166
What? A year? Where? Smeerensburg?

04:31.250 --> 04:32.875
What is...
What's happening right now? Dad?

04:32.958 --> 04:34.791
Six thousand letters will suffice.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.416
Stamped by your own hand.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.125
And listen carefully, Jesper.

04:38.208 --> 04:41.416
If you fail to get those letters,
you're cut off.

04:41.958 --> 04:43.666
No more fancy apartments,

04:43.750 --> 04:45.708
-stagecoach, clothes, galas...
-[grunts]

04:45.791 --> 04:47.000
All gone.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.875
You can look forward to
a cozy spot in the gutter.

04:49.958 --> 04:52.583
-But--
-Six thousand letters, one year.

04:52.666 --> 04:55.625
You can't cheat, bribe
or squirm your way out of this one.

04:57.125 --> 05:01.333
Dad! Come on!
It's me. Let's talk about this, man.

05:01.416 --> 05:04.458
It's your son, Jesper! Little Jespie!

05:04.541 --> 05:07.583
Remember, I...
"Daddy, can I help you mail the letters?

05:07.666 --> 05:10.208
Can I help you put the medals
in the letters

05:10.291 --> 05:12.083
and put them in a stamp with the--"

05:12.166 --> 05:13.583
W-w-wait!

05:13.666 --> 05:15.916
Do you know how long it took
to press this uniform?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.958
I don't either,
but it took somebody hours.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.041
Hello?

05:20.541 --> 05:23.500
Burghard! Finally, a friendly face.
Can you believe what they...

05:24.083 --> 05:27.041
Burghard, I'm not in the coach with you.
Burghard?

05:31.791 --> 05:36.041
[Drill Sergeant] Sir,
I'm all for discipline, but Smeerensburg?

05:36.125 --> 05:38.708
Isn't that a bit excessive?

05:38.791 --> 05:40.041
[sighs]

05:40.125 --> 05:43.416
That boy needs a wake-up call, Sergeant.
And who knows?

05:43.958 --> 05:47.125
Someday he might even thank me for it.

05:47.791 --> 05:49.250
[sarcastically] Thank you, Dad!

05:49.333 --> 05:52.583
This is really wonderful, Father.
Thank you so much.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.375
This is great, Dad.

05:54.458 --> 05:56.083
Really, really great.

06:00.125 --> 06:01.250
Thanks, Dad!

06:01.333 --> 06:02.750
[strains and grunts]

06:02.833 --> 06:03.708
Thank you!

06:03.791 --> 06:06.208
I love this terrible coach ride.

06:06.291 --> 06:07.541
Thank you so much!

06:07.625 --> 06:10.250
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

06:24.708 --> 06:25.625
[huffs]

06:26.166 --> 06:28.041
[clears throat]

06:28.125 --> 06:31.791
You go back to the intersection.
You make a left at the dead tree.

06:31.875 --> 06:32.875
You're welcome.

06:33.416 --> 06:35.083
What? No. I'm not lost.

06:35.166 --> 06:36.625
Trust me, you are.

06:36.708 --> 06:39.375
[laughs] Funny! Say, nice boat!

06:39.458 --> 06:41.625
Any chance you might
actually get on it today?

06:43.166 --> 06:44.833
What was that?

06:44.916 --> 06:47.333
New postman. Smeerensburg.

06:47.416 --> 06:49.750
Which is on an island,
which is surrounded by water,

06:49.833 --> 06:52.083
which I need a boat to get to,
which you have.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.458
Are we starting to connect the dots?

06:55.333 --> 06:56.458
[chuckles]

07:00.041 --> 07:02.041
[Mogens whistling]

07:04.041 --> 07:05.916
Is the weather always like this?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.291
Eh. We're having a bit of a heat wave.

07:12.125 --> 07:13.125
Huh?

07:27.250 --> 07:30.458
There she is. Smeerensburg.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Charming, huh?
Why, you should see it in the spring.

07:37.083 --> 07:40.166
That's when those grays really pop.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.333
[Mogens whistling]

07:48.666 --> 07:50.416
What happened here?

07:50.500 --> 07:54.958
Oh! Uh, colorful local traditions.
Quirky folklore. That kind of thing.

07:55.041 --> 07:58.500
All part of this quaint town's
vibrant culture.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.208
[children giggling]

08:01.291 --> 08:03.291
No, no! Why you...

08:03.375 --> 08:07.041
Oh, you rotten vermin! [yelling]

08:13.375 --> 08:14.833
[shushes]

08:37.291 --> 08:38.458
Where is everyone?

08:38.541 --> 08:39.541
Everyone?

08:39.625 --> 08:42.375
I thought there would be
some sort of a reception.

08:43.833 --> 08:47.750
Oh! Right. Right, the reception.
Of course, the reception.

08:47.833 --> 08:48.833
It's good you reminded me.

08:48.916 --> 08:53.041
You just ring the bell over there and,
uh... and then the reception will start.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.458
-The bell?
-Yep. Give it a go.

08:55.541 --> 08:56.583
And they'll come out.

08:56.666 --> 09:01.208
Why, they'll have a band, hors d'oeuvres
and, uh... and the key to the city.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.083
All that reception stuff.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.250
Really?

09:04.333 --> 09:06.750
-Out here?
-Why, of course!

09:06.833 --> 09:11.458
Well, it's not every day they get
a brand-new postman from the big city.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.250
[bell ringing]

09:17.916 --> 09:19.666
[all yelling and clamoring]

09:19.750 --> 09:20.916
Huh?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.041
[clamoring continues]

09:30.166 --> 09:33.333
What's happening?

09:37.208 --> 09:38.833
[gasping]

09:38.916 --> 09:39.833
[screams]

09:39.916 --> 09:41.375

-Whoa! Whoa! [gasps]

09:43.208 --> 09:45.333
-[roars]
-[Jesper] Aah!

09:46.000 --> 09:48.583
Ow, they're biting!
Ow, get off! Get off! Get off!

[shudders]

09:51.583 --> 09:52.708
[yelps]

09:53.291 --> 09:54.750
[Mogens] Isn't this nice?

09:54.833 --> 09:56.416
And you thought they forgot.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.000
Quick! Get me out of here! [screams]

09:59.500 --> 10:01.500
[continues screaming]

10:15.208 --> 10:17.333
-Uh...
-What's going on out here?

10:17.416 --> 10:19.625
-Why is everybody just standing around?
-[Mrs. Krum] Well!

10:19.708 --> 10:22.500
Look who's finally throwing in the towel!

10:22.583 --> 10:24.208
Throwing in the... Us?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.541
Ha! That's rich!

10:25.625 --> 10:29.291
Admit it!
You weaseled out and rang the bell!

10:29.375 --> 10:32.208
[Mr. Ellingboe] An Ellingboe? Never!
It was one of you critters!

10:32.291 --> 10:33.333
Don't you dare raise your voice at me!

10:33.416 --> 10:34.833
-Oh, there you go!
-You rang that bell!

10:34.916 --> 10:36.083
-You know you rang... Oh!
-[Magdalone growls]

10:36.166 --> 10:38.541
[Mr. Ellingboe] You chicken out,
and now you want to pin it on us!

10:38.625 --> 10:40.291
-[Mrs. Krum] Unbelievable!
-We were plowing the snow--

10:40.375 --> 10:41.750
[Jesper] Oh, whoa! Hey!

10:42.333 --> 10:44.458
Huh. What've you got there, children?

10:45.041 --> 10:46.708
-Mine!
-[Jesper straining]

10:46.791 --> 10:48.875
Pumpkin, show Daddy what you found.

10:48.958 --> 10:50.375
[continues straining]

10:50.458 --> 10:51.458
[huffs]

10:52.541 --> 10:53.458
Mine.

10:53.541 --> 10:55.083
[gasping]

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
This is no way to treat a person!

10:58.083 --> 11:00.291
Certainly not this person!

11:00.375 --> 11:01.750
Just one second. Let me just...

11:01.833 --> 11:02.750
A postman?

11:02.833 --> 11:05.083
-Pfft. Give me a break.
-When will they learn?

11:05.166 --> 11:07.958
Hey! They've sent us another postman!

11:08.041 --> 11:09.833
[all laughing]

11:11.666 --> 11:13.291
All right. All right.

11:13.375 --> 11:16.041
You don't know who I am,
so I'm gonna let this one slide.

11:16.125 --> 11:19.000
Okay? But let's just say
I'm not really a postman.

11:19.083 --> 11:22.250
Well, I am, because it's
our family business. My father's a...

11:22.333 --> 11:25.041
-Don't get me started, because it's--
-Where were we? Oh, yeah. Bell, please!

11:25.125 --> 11:26.625
-[chuckles]
-[Jesper] Life is too short

11:26.708 --> 11:29.666
-to go into details, but-- [gasps]
-[villagers clamoring]

11:29.750 --> 11:31.166
[exclaiming]

11:36.083 --> 11:38.416
[grunts and pants]

11:39.291 --> 11:40.833
[panting]

11:40.916 --> 11:43.083
[Alva] Come to the counter.
I'll be right out.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.125
All right, listen.

11:44.208 --> 11:48.791
Whoever's there, I warn you,
you do not want to mess with me. Okay?

11:48.875 --> 11:51.375
Holy mackerel! Oh, the smell!

11:51.458 --> 11:54.125
Fresh out of mackerel.
Only herring and burbot today.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.208
[grunts]

11:59.333 --> 12:00.208
Oh. [retches]

12:00.750 --> 12:01.666
Oh.

12:01.750 --> 12:05.666
Uniform, cold sweat, scared stiff,
shaking in your boots.

12:05.750 --> 12:08.416
All right, I'm gonna just
take a wild guess here.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.125
You are the latest mailman,

12:11.208 --> 12:14.416
and the ferryman tricked you
into ringing the Battle Bell.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.833
The Battle Bell?
What kind of a town has a Battle Bell?

12:17.916 --> 12:20.166
Can we open a window in here or something?
I can't pretend any--

12:20.250 --> 12:22.375
-[villagers clamoring]
-Welcome to Smeerensburg,

12:22.458 --> 12:24.916
home of the world's finest feuds.

12:25.500 --> 12:26.333
Feuds?

12:26.416 --> 12:28.083
-[object falling]
-Grudges, bickering,

12:28.166 --> 12:30.666
the Krums versus the Ellingboes.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.291
-So...
-[object lands heavily]

12:32.375 --> 12:35.500
...are you gonna buy something,
or are you just here to chitchat?

12:36.041 --> 12:36.875
Wait.

12:37.541 --> 12:41.250
Isn't this a school?
Shouldn't there be children and a teacher?

12:41.333 --> 12:44.166
Oh! Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you!

12:44.250 --> 12:46.500
I knew I was forgetting something!
Children!

12:46.583 --> 12:47.666
Thank you!

12:48.416 --> 12:49.333
You're the teacher?

12:49.416 --> 12:50.750
Okay, here's how it works.

12:50.833 --> 12:53.416
I sell fish, and then the person
on the other side of the counter...

12:53.500 --> 12:56.833
-That would be you. You buy--
-Holy moly! That's you?

12:57.500 --> 12:58.958
What happened?

12:59.041 --> 13:01.166
-What happened was--
-That's... That came out wrong.

13:01.250 --> 13:02.291
I took a teaching job

13:02.375 --> 13:05.375
at a place where people
don't send their kids to school!

13:05.458 --> 13:07.375
-[splutters]
-Mingling with their sworn enemy's spawn?

13:07.458 --> 13:09.208
-[exclaims]
-Oh, no! We can't have that!

13:09.291 --> 13:13.125
So, now I'm reduced to doing this
so I can get some money

13:13.208 --> 13:17.375
and start fresh
somewhere far, far away from here.

13:17.916 --> 13:20.666
Are you going to buy something?

13:21.458 --> 13:22.833
Herring's on sale today.

13:23.625 --> 13:24.666
[door opens]

13:24.750 --> 13:27.750
Ah! There you are.
I wondered where you'd scurried off to!

13:27.833 --> 13:29.250
Morning, Miss. Alva.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.583
-[Alva] Mogens.
-Come on, sport!

13:31.666 --> 13:33.791
I saved the best for last!

13:39.583 --> 13:41.000
Home sweet home.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.208
-Ow! What the...
-[boy laughs]

13:44.291 --> 13:47.375
-Mail that, postman!
-Now wait a minute, that's completely--

13:47.458 --> 13:49.000
Go home, you loser!

13:49.083 --> 13:52.916
Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm a loser,
then you're a, uh...

13:53.000 --> 13:54.791
You're too far. You're gone.

13:55.916 --> 13:56.791
[Mogens grunts]

13:56.875 --> 13:58.875
[clucking]

14:02.666 --> 14:04.833
Well, lots of nice, natural light,

14:04.916 --> 14:07.791
rustic touches, central air
and panoramic views.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.083
-Perfect for animal lovers.
-[clucks]

14:10.833 --> 14:12.916
-Enjoy.
-Wait! Wait!

14:13.000 --> 14:14.708
This can't be right! I...

14:15.416 --> 14:19.333
[chuckles] Oh, I get it. Did my father
put you up to this? Good one.

14:19.416 --> 14:20.916
Ha ha. You got me.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.083
Okay, well, enough of that.
Show me where I'm really staying.

14:24.166 --> 14:26.375
I'd like a hot bath
and a look at the dinner menu.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.250
Here, let me help you out. [clears throat]

14:29.333 --> 14:31.750
You're a postman in Smeerensburg,

14:31.833 --> 14:34.750
which is on an island
cut off from the world,

14:34.833 --> 14:37.208
frigid cold, angry, violent neighbors,

14:37.291 --> 14:39.750
and this is home now.

14:39.833 --> 14:42.291
Are we starting to connect the dots?

14:45.125 --> 14:45.958
Aah!

14:46.708 --> 14:48.000
Ugh.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.500
Almost. Hang in there.

15:11.833 --> 15:13.666
[shivering]

15:17.833 --> 15:19.541
[muttering]

15:19.625 --> 15:20.625
What?

15:21.791 --> 15:23.250
-[crows]
-[grunts]

15:23.333 --> 15:24.625
[screams]

15:36.208 --> 15:37.750
[shuddering]

15:37.833 --> 15:38.666
[screams]

15:41.791 --> 15:42.625
Hmm?

15:42.708 --> 15:43.541
Oh.

15:44.125 --> 15:44.958
[grunts]

15:46.000 --> 15:47.208
-[screeches]
-Aah!

15:48.458 --> 15:51.041
[sobbing] That's it!
This place is the worst!

15:51.125 --> 15:51.958
I'm going home!

15:52.041 --> 15:54.208
No! You can't leave, remember?

15:54.291 --> 15:56.416
You'll be broke! Out in the streets!

15:56.500 --> 15:58.416
But I hate it here!

15:58.500 --> 16:00.125
It's so cold and icky!

16:00.208 --> 16:02.875
And the people are mean to me.
And I miss my silk sheets.

16:02.958 --> 16:05.041
Shut up! Stop being weak!

16:05.125 --> 16:07.208
Focus! How do you get out of here?

16:07.291 --> 16:09.333
You need... You need...

16:09.916 --> 16:11.041
letters!

16:11.125 --> 16:12.125
Ugh.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.416
All right. This is a good one.
I can feel it.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.875
Come to Papa, you sweet, sweet little...

16:18.958 --> 16:20.625
Oh, come on!

16:20.708 --> 16:22.125
Ugh! Pssh!

16:23.291 --> 16:24.208
[retches]

16:25.000 --> 16:27.166
[groans]

16:30.125 --> 16:32.458
Fine. Go to the source, I guess.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.166
Good morning, madame.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.000
I'm the postman, obviously.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.750
If you have letters you'd like me to send,

16:37.833 --> 16:40.041
you could go scurry ahead
and get them and...

16:46.250 --> 16:47.416
Hello! Hi! Hi!

16:47.500 --> 16:50.041
If you have your letters on you,
I'd be glad to take them off your--

16:50.125 --> 16:50.958
[grunts]

16:52.166 --> 16:53.000
Hmph!

16:53.083 --> 16:55.166
Birthday cards? Distant cousin?

16:55.250 --> 16:56.208
Deceased notice?

16:56.291 --> 16:57.541
Holy mother!

16:59.041 --> 17:01.833
-[screaming] Any letters... or packages?
-[playing instruments noisily]

17:01.916 --> 17:02.750
Any packages?

17:02.833 --> 17:04.791
Come on, people!

17:04.875 --> 17:07.791
Letters! Letters! I don't have all day!

17:07.875 --> 17:09.875
-[screams]
-[thugs yell]

17:10.666 --> 17:12.916
Okay, keep low. Don't panic. Don't panic.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.833
Oh, I guess that's why
they call it "snail mail."

17:15.916 --> 17:16.750
[grunts]

17:16.833 --> 17:19.500
All right. What's going on here?
Where are all the letters?

17:19.583 --> 17:23.166
Oh. Folks around here only have
one thing to say to one another.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.166
Ah.

17:25.250 --> 17:28.041
And they're getting their point across
pretty well without mail.

17:28.125 --> 17:29.750
-Wouldn't you say?
-Wait, wait, wait.

17:29.833 --> 17:33.416
No letters?
But how am I supposed to get out of...

17:34.416 --> 17:36.166
-What the...
-[boy] Hello?

17:36.250 --> 17:38.750
Sir, can I get my drawing back?

17:38.833 --> 17:40.291
The wind blew it away.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.500
-Please?
-Not now, kid.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.583
Can't you see I'm busy
trying to figure out how to get...

17:46.750 --> 17:47.916
Well, here's a thought.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.291
I'm a postman, see?

17:49.375 --> 17:53.458
So I can't give it to you,
but I could mail it to you.

17:53.541 --> 17:55.208
-[boy] How?
-Couldn't be simpler!

17:55.291 --> 17:58.833
I just fold your pretty drawing,
very beautiful by the way,

17:58.916 --> 18:00.583
put it in an envelope like this

18:00.666 --> 18:04.458
and then all that's left is postage
so I can put it in the mailbox for you.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.333
-Postage?
-Yep.

18:06.416 --> 18:09.416
You just toss a penny over to me
so I can stamp it,

18:09.500 --> 18:10.875
and we're all ready to go.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.458
Couldn't you just put it in?

18:14.541 --> 18:16.291
Aw. Tsk.

18:16.375 --> 18:19.625
I really, really would, but I can't.

18:19.708 --> 18:22.458
It's not a letter
if it doesn't have postage.

18:22.541 --> 18:23.416
See how it works?

18:24.000 --> 18:24.958
So what do you say?

18:25.041 --> 18:27.208
I get my letter, and you get your drawing.

18:27.291 --> 18:29.458
Win-win. You want your drawing, don't you?

18:29.541 --> 18:31.083
-Um...
-If you don't, I'm gonna keep it.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.458
-Hmm.
-I love it.

18:32.541 --> 18:33.666
I would keep it if I was you,

18:33.750 --> 18:36.000
so I would send this letter
back to myself if I was you.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.208
[hounds growling]

18:37.875 --> 18:39.583
[boy] Oh, hi, Papa!

18:39.666 --> 18:42.583
This nice man says
he can mail my drawing back to me!

18:42.666 --> 18:45.083
-He's lying. Children are liars.
-[boy] Can you give him a penny?

18:45.166 --> 18:47.291
Oh, look at that. Wrong address. Silly me.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.166
These aren't...
You're not the Spendlebergs.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.250
I'll see you later.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.958
Thank you so much,
and no need... [mumbling]

18:52.583 --> 18:54.541
-[hounds barking]
-[Jesper] Aah! The puppies! The puppies!

18:54.625 --> 18:57.666
Ah. And that must be the express mail.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.250
[Jesper] All right, Smeerensburg.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.666
You may have won this round,

19:01.750 --> 19:04.083
but if you think I'm giving up,
think again.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.625
I'll have my letters in no time,

19:05.708 --> 19:08.208
and then it's bye-bye to you
and your cold and your loons

19:08.291 --> 19:09.708
and your chickens! That's right! You too!

19:09.791 --> 19:10.666
[clucking]

19:10.750 --> 19:12.416
You'll see. I give it a week.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.083
Two, tops.

19:25.166 --> 19:26.541
[wood creaking]

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
[hens clucking]

19:37.125 --> 19:40.083
Is this a bad time?
I can see you're pretty swamped.

19:40.166 --> 19:44.541
[sighs] Don't you have...

19:45.041 --> 19:46.958
a job or something?

19:47.041 --> 19:48.291
Why, sure I do.

19:48.375 --> 19:51.583
I'm here to pick up all the outgoing mail.

19:51.666 --> 19:52.833
So, where is it?

19:52.916 --> 19:55.041
Now, you're gonna have to help me
with the heavier bags.

19:55.125 --> 19:56.166
Bad back, don't you know.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.750
-[Jesper] Man, I hate you.
-I know.

19:58.833 --> 20:01.416
So, uh, where is the mail, anyway?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.166
Where do you keep it?
In a different room now or something?

20:04.250 --> 20:06.291
What about if I walk around the room,

20:06.375 --> 20:10.333
if I get close to the mail,
you say "warmer"?

20:10.416 --> 20:15.125
And if I'm getting
farther from the mail, you say "colder"?

20:15.708 --> 20:16.875
-And then--
-What's that?

20:17.458 --> 20:19.208
What? Oh, the woodsman's cabin?

20:19.291 --> 20:21.166
[Jesper] Yeah, does someone live there?

20:21.250 --> 20:24.125
Well, sure.
Yeah, you should definitely drop by.

20:24.208 --> 20:27.250
Nice fella. Loves visitors.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.250
[bridge creaking]

21:15.958 --> 21:16.958
[grunts]

21:47.458 --> 21:49.458
[door creaking]

21:52.541 --> 21:56.708
Hello? I'm in your house
or... whatever this place is.

21:56.791 --> 21:57.875
Anybody here?

21:58.958 --> 22:00.000
[grunts softly]

22:04.875 --> 22:06.750
Ah, come on. Really?

22:06.833 --> 22:08.500
[grunting]

22:11.250 --> 22:13.916
Of course. Of course this would happen.

22:19.041 --> 22:21.750
Great. I'm gonna kill that boatman.

22:27.000 --> 22:27.916
What?

22:32.666 --> 22:33.666
Toys?

22:38.208 --> 22:39.083
Ah, here we go.

22:45.833 --> 22:50.875
Now I can go home with the satisfaction
of having accomplished absolutely...

22:50.958 --> 22:51.791
[grunting]

22:51.875 --> 22:53.375
[footsteps thudding]

22:53.458 --> 22:54.541
[whimpers] Aah!

23:01.416 --> 23:03.416
[playing music]

23:11.250 --> 23:12.458

Aah!

[pants]

23:24.583 --> 23:25.416
[music stops]

23:25.500 --> 23:27.208
[panting]

23:29.875 --> 23:31.208
Aah!

23:36.333 --> 23:37.666
[screaming]

23:50.583 --> 23:51.541
[screams]

23:54.291 --> 23:55.458
[grunts]

23:55.541 --> 23:57.541
[whimpering and panting]

24:03.083 --> 24:04.083
Yeehaw!

24:08.500 --> 24:09.750
[footsteps approaching]

25:16.458 --> 25:18.125
That's it! I've had it!

25:18.208 --> 25:20.583
Better alive in the gutter
than hacked into pieces!

25:20.666 --> 25:21.916
No, thank you!

25:25.000 --> 25:25.833
Yah!

25:28.916 --> 25:30.708
[yelps and screams]

25:30.791 --> 25:31.791
[grunts]

25:35.291 --> 25:36.125
[gasps]

25:38.041 --> 25:41.916
[screams] Please don't chop me up
and scatter my parts in the woods!

25:45.958 --> 25:47.125
[whimpers]

25:47.958 --> 25:49.083
Where's this?

25:49.166 --> 25:51.375
What? I don't know. How would I...

25:51.458 --> 25:52.291
Wait.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.125
I do know.

25:54.208 --> 25:56.833
Keep going down this road,
and you'll get there.

25:56.916 --> 25:59.000
You can't miss it. It...
Or I can show you.

25:59.083 --> 26:01.166
Sure. Yeah, let me just show you.

26:11.041 --> 26:12.125
All right.

26:12.208 --> 26:13.125
[grunts]

26:13.208 --> 26:14.583
Excuse me. Just... Can I...

26:14.666 --> 26:15.666
[groans]

26:16.333 --> 26:17.250
Here we are.

26:17.333 --> 26:19.958
Watch your step getting out of the, uh...
What's this?

26:20.875 --> 26:22.708
You're a postman, aren't you?

26:23.958 --> 26:25.458
Oh, you want me to... [chuckles]

26:26.041 --> 26:27.291
No, but I...

26:29.458 --> 26:31.250
[clears throat] Sure thing. My pleasure.

26:31.916 --> 26:33.000
Nothing I'd love to do more

26:33.083 --> 26:38.166
than deliver what I'm fairly certain
can only be a severed head of some kind.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.083
I mean, there's no way
that's not a severed head.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.875
It's gotta... I'm holding a head
in my hand, but hey!

26:42.958 --> 26:43.791
[grunts]

26:43.875 --> 26:46.041
Come on! Look, I'm--

26:46.625 --> 26:47.791
Ah! You're right there!

26:47.875 --> 26:50.666
So quiet for a disproportionately...

26:50.750 --> 26:53.583
-I mean, strapping, uh... statuesque.
-[growls]

26:53.666 --> 26:55.541
You have a kind of, um...

26:59.500 --> 27:00.708
What? In there?

27:00.791 --> 27:03.083
You must be kidding.
No way. Absolutely not.

27:03.166 --> 27:05.125
I mean, first of all,
I'd love to, of course,

27:05.208 --> 27:07.083
but, look, too bad about the fence.

27:07.166 --> 27:08.625
Rats. Oh, well.

27:08.708 --> 27:10.958
What are you gonna do? Are you...
What's happening right now?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.083
Hey, listen, please. Open this!

27:14.166 --> 27:16.416
-Why are you doing this to me?
-[hounds growling]

27:16.500 --> 27:17.458
Oh, no.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.166
[snarling]

27:20.250 --> 27:22.458
[barking]

27:22.541 --> 27:25.083
Okay, you win. What do you want?
Money? My dad's got plenty of it.

27:25.166 --> 27:27.083
You can write him a ransom note.
You can write, right?

27:27.166 --> 27:28.375
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'll write it for you.

27:29.333 --> 27:32.666
Ah! He'll never know it's me!
I'll make it sound like it's from you!

27:32.750 --> 27:35.166
I'll use monosyllabic words, man!
Please! Please! Please!

27:35.250 --> 27:37.166
Just let me out of here!
I'm gonna get--

27:37.250 --> 27:38.666

27:38.750 --> 27:40.875
Why?

27:42.333 --> 27:43.166

28:02.291 --> 28:04.375

28:06.458 --> 28:08.208
Open up. Open up. Open up! Come on!

28:08.291 --> 28:09.541
Come on! Come on! Come on!

28:10.333 --> 28:13.750
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Keep it together! Keep it together!

28:13.833 --> 28:14.958

Aah!

28:22.375 --> 28:23.791

28:24.583 --> 28:25.791
Where are they, boys?

28:25.875 --> 28:28.625
Don't let 'em get away! Come on! Get 'em!

28:28.708 --> 28:29.833
[gasps] Okay.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.791
I've done all you've asked. Can I please--

28:31.875 --> 28:33.208
[muffled speech]

28:38.083 --> 28:40.333
[muffled speech]

28:43.375 --> 28:44.375
Hmm.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.208
-Oh, no!
-[girl] Mr. Postman?

30:20.750 --> 30:22.041
Are you in there?

30:23.208 --> 30:25.000
Go away! Go! Leave! He'll hear you!

30:25.875 --> 30:28.208
We'd like to send these letters!

30:29.750 --> 30:32.208
[objects clattering]

30:32.291 --> 30:33.291
[hen clucking]

30:34.541 --> 30:36.291
What? What did you just say?

30:36.375 --> 30:39.875
Our cousin told us
if we write a letter to Mr. Klaus,

30:39.958 --> 30:41.000
he'll make us a toy.

30:41.083 --> 30:43.375
He also said to bring you a penny each.

30:43.458 --> 30:46.750
It's not a letter
if it doesn't have postage, right?

30:48.083 --> 30:49.916
["How You Like Me Now?" playing]

30:57.750 --> 30:59.583
-Psst. Hey. Hey, you.
-Hmm?

30:59.666 --> 31:00.666
You want a toy?

31:04.750 --> 31:06.958
-[chuckles]
-Hey! Would you, uh...

31:07.041 --> 31:08.000
like a brand-new toy?

31:08.666 --> 31:11.250
Just write a letter to Mr. Klaus.

31:12.500 --> 31:17.166
And you put it in the envelope,
write your name on it and bring a penny.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.333
Can't forget the penny.

31:35.541 --> 31:37.666
These better sound sad. Do they sound sad?

31:38.250 --> 31:39.166
Okay, good job.

31:45.458 --> 31:47.958
All right. And now...

31:48.625 --> 31:49.708

[wood creaking]

32:21.250 --> 32:22.250
[Klaus grunts]

32:23.750 --> 32:24.875
All right. Remember...

32:25.458 --> 32:27.583
probably not an ax murderer, though...

32:28.166 --> 32:30.916
it still is a possibility,
but most likely... no.

32:31.541 --> 32:33.458
He's a good guy... deep down.

32:34.416 --> 32:36.416
-[clears throat] Hello.
-[grunts]

32:36.500 --> 32:40.125
[clears throat] Hello.
Mr... Klaus, I take it?

32:40.208 --> 32:43.458
You remember me from the nice
breaking and entering last night?

32:43.541 --> 32:45.541
[chuckles] Jesper Johanssen, postman,

32:45.625 --> 32:48.208
-but we never properly--
-[grunts]

32:48.291 --> 32:50.083
[gulps] Uh...

32:50.625 --> 32:51.750
I, uh...

32:51.833 --> 32:56.208
You see, Mr. Klaus,
it seems like word got around

32:56.291 --> 33:00.166
that the poor children of Smeerensburg
have started, uh...

33:00.250 --> 33:01.791
completely unprompted...

33:01.875 --> 33:04.375
writing letters asking you for...

33:06.041 --> 33:07.458
toys. [coughs]

33:08.041 --> 33:09.208
So I figured

33:09.291 --> 33:11.833
you have the whole barn filled with toys

33:11.916 --> 33:14.583
just sitting there collecting dust, so...

33:14.666 --> 33:15.583
[whimpers]

33:18.291 --> 33:21.125
Oh, God. Okay. This is it. Here it goes.

33:23.958 --> 33:24.791
[grunts]

33:28.583 --> 33:30.583
[chirping]

33:32.666 --> 33:35.458
-[all chirping]
-[Jesper] Oh, wow.

33:35.541 --> 33:37.208
That is...

33:38.625 --> 33:39.958
totally normal.

33:40.041 --> 33:42.458
Not a symptom of any mental illness
or anything.

33:42.541 --> 33:44.750
-[Klaus] Go away.
-Mr. Klaus, sir!

33:44.833 --> 33:46.916
Those little children... [grunts]

33:47.000 --> 33:49.541
...if you donate your old toys to them...

33:49.625 --> 33:52.833
[pants] ...well,
I'll gladly deliver them for free!

33:59.375 --> 34:00.500
Mr. Klaus, wait!

34:01.166 --> 34:03.375
Please! [panting]

34:03.458 --> 34:06.791
Think of all the joy you'll bring
their miserable little lives!

34:07.708 --> 34:08.541
Look, here.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.208
Poor little Herlief.

34:10.291 --> 34:13.208
He only has sticks and stones
to play with. So sad.

34:13.291 --> 34:14.708
And this one,

34:14.791 --> 34:17.000
little Penny... Patty.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.000
Her doll was so old,

34:19.083 --> 34:21.708
it crumbled in her arms
when she came to me.

34:21.791 --> 34:24.541
And then Kristoff...
Little, ugly Kristoff.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.208
This little...

34:33.208 --> 34:34.625
Tonight, same time.

34:35.916 --> 34:39.791
Great! What, "same time"?
You mean, dead of night?

34:39.875 --> 34:42.166
-I can just take the toys now.
-No. I go with you.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.458
There's no need
for you to come with me, really.

34:44.541 --> 34:45.875
It might be against the law

34:45.958 --> 34:48.875
for a noncertified postman
to ride with me.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.291
I have to check the rule book.

34:50.875 --> 34:54.291
Great. Tonight, then. I'll see you then.
Good talk. Good talk.

34:57.250 --> 34:59.250

35:09.541 --> 35:10.375

Whoa! Whoo!

35:27.375 --> 35:28.208
[gasps]

35:28.791 --> 35:29.625
Huh?

35:29.708 --> 35:30.791

35:31.958 --> 35:33.041

-Oh, oh!
-[gasps]

35:35.583 --> 35:36.583
[gasps]

35:39.750 --> 35:40.666
[man] Playing!

35:40.750 --> 35:42.583
Playing, I tell you.

35:42.666 --> 35:44.000
With an Ellingboe!

35:44.083 --> 35:46.416
-[councilman 1] An Ellingboe, no less!
-[councilman 2] In all my years!

35:46.500 --> 35:48.500
-Did you all hear that?
-Unacceptable.

35:48.583 --> 35:50.000
-[man] I don't know how it happened.
-[yelps]

35:50.083 --> 35:52.333
I turned away for one second...

35:54.500 --> 35:56.000
And then I saw it.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.125
I brought her as soon as I could, sir.

35:58.208 --> 36:00.458
-That's just wrong! Wrong, I say!
-Inconceivable!

36:00.541 --> 36:02.625
-What are we going to do?
-Unthinkable!

36:02.708 --> 36:05.333
Hmm. This is bad. Very bad.

36:05.416 --> 36:08.541
Worst I've ever seen, really.
What were you thinking, kid?

36:08.625 --> 36:09.583
Don't you know that--

36:09.666 --> 36:12.875
Krums and Ellingboes don't mix.

36:13.541 --> 36:15.375
-But why?
-"Why?" he asks!

36:15.458 --> 36:16.916
-See what I mean?
-[councilwoman] Why?

36:17.000 --> 36:18.166
I don't know what to do!

36:18.750 --> 36:21.125
Please help us, miss! I beg you!

36:23.083 --> 36:23.916
[gasps]

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
[squeals]

36:29.500 --> 36:32.416
Do you know what this is, little boy?

36:33.125 --> 36:36.833
This is tradition!

36:36.916 --> 36:42.916
Centuries of glorious hatred,
passed down through generations!

36:43.000 --> 36:45.833
There was the hundred-day brawl of '45.

36:45.916 --> 36:47.500
Which we totally won!

36:47.583 --> 36:49.500
The maritime game of chicken.

36:49.583 --> 36:52.291
The Great Mooning of '86.

36:52.833 --> 36:53.666
[gasps]

36:54.458 --> 36:56.583
So, if there's something we know...

36:56.666 --> 36:59.250
...going back as far as we can remember...

36:59.333 --> 37:01.833
...it's that a Krum
despises an Ellingboe...

37:01.916 --> 37:05.458
...and an Ellingboe can't stand a Krum!

37:09.958 --> 37:11.875
That is why.

37:11.958 --> 37:12.875
[gasps]

37:12.958 --> 37:19.958
Now, I just know you didn't mean to
disrespect all of that heritage, right?

37:20.041 --> 37:23.125
-Right.
-And it won't happen again,

37:23.208 --> 37:24.541
will it?

37:25.541 --> 37:27.125
Of course not.

37:27.666 --> 37:30.916
Now, tell me all about
where this pretty thing came from.

37:35.625 --> 37:36.625
Ugh.

37:37.458 --> 37:40.583
Let me guess.
Leaving it at the gate not an option?

37:43.083 --> 37:45.333
You really have a way with words,
you know?

37:46.291 --> 37:49.083
Of course, you don't...
Of course, don't even answer that...

37:51.125 --> 37:51.958
[groans]

37:52.958 --> 37:54.541
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

37:55.708 --> 37:56.541
[grunts]

37:57.083 --> 37:58.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no!

[screams]

38:00.041 --> 38:01.000

-[child 1] Out of the way!
-[child 3] Mine first!

38:50.375 --> 38:51.416
I want a bicycle!

38:51.500 --> 38:53.083
-Tell Mr. Klaus I want a bicycle!
-Shut up!

38:53.166 --> 38:54.875
-Take my letter! Take my letter!
-Mine! Me!

38:54.958 --> 38:56.875
Me first! Me first! A doll!

38:56.958 --> 39:00.458
-Me! Me! Me!
-Okay! Okay! Single line! Chop-chop!

39:00.541 --> 39:02.791
Fall back! All right. Everyone, in line.

39:02.875 --> 39:04.000
-There you go.
-Get out! Move.

39:04.083 --> 39:07.000
Letter? Good. Letter? Good.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.208
Got it. Get out of here.
Great. Move along.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.125

39:14.208 --> 39:18.375

-She's not from here. She's Saami.

39:19.041 --> 39:22.083
[speaking Saami]

-Yeah!

40:57.166 --> 40:59.166
"Klaus"? "Awesome"?

40:59.250 --> 41:02.125
He's huge,
but he can squeeze down any chimney!

-Really? How?
-I don't know.

41:03.958 --> 41:04.958

Who's the loser now, you little brat?

Mr. Klaus is the coolest.

42:02.791 --> 42:04.541
[boy] Hey, have you heard about Klaus?

42:04.625 --> 42:06.208
His name is Klaus,
and he makes the best toys.

-Klaus.
-Klaus.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.625

Why don't you go ahead and just,
I don't know,

42:48.416 --> 42:50.083

will you get out of here? Please?

I can go by myself. You don't have to...

43:58.250 --> 44:02.625
I mean, no offense, but someone could use
a little diet cleanse. What are you doing?

44:03.916 --> 44:06.208
Less presents, less weight.

44:06.291 --> 44:07.250
Less presents?

44:07.333 --> 44:11.291
But less presents means less letters,
and less letters means less...

44:14.125 --> 44:16.625
more children's dreams being shattered.

44:17.125 --> 44:20.125
No. No, no, no, I won't allow it.

I've got my own problems, you know?

and without toys, there are no letters.

I'm saying it's time to join forces
against a common enemy.

55:50.291 --> 55:53.250
I'm saying we need a truce.

55:53.333 --> 55:56.416
[gasps] A truce? Have you gone mad?

55:56.500 --> 55:58.958
Either we band together
to take care of this,

55:59.041 --> 56:00.875
or it's gonna be all book clubs

56:00.958 --> 56:02.875

-[man] And brunches!

-Yes, that... that too.

So, we must join together in peace
to help stop this peace?

gets up on Christmas morning

58:12.208 --> 58:14.083
and finds a...

58:14.166 --> 58:17.250
brand-new toy waiting for them
by the fireplace.

58:17.750 --> 58:19.875
We can make the holiday even more magical.

58:19.958 --> 58:21.708
Think of the joy. Think of the happiness.

58:21.791 --> 58:23.166

[chuckles] And she loved it, right?

1:05:41.666 --> 1:05:43.583
I think she did.
Do you think she loved it?

1:05:43.666 --> 1:05:44.500
[grunts]

1:05:44.583 --> 1:05:45.958
-I do.
-Yeah.

1:05:46.041 --> 1:05:48.125
Me too. Me too. Yeah, she loved it.

1:05:48.208 --> 1:05:49.416
[chuckles]

1:05:49.500 --> 1:05:55.291
You know, I remember the day I first had
that very same smile on my face.

1:05:55.375 --> 1:06:00.166
What? What smile? I wasn't smiling.
I was squinting. From the sun.

1:06:00.250 --> 1:06:01.333
Right.

1:06:01.833 --> 1:06:03.958
I didn't want to admit it at first either.

1:06:04.416 --> 1:06:06.416
[chuckles] She used to tease me about it.

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.458
"She"?

1:06:08.541 --> 1:06:09.875
My Lydia.

1:06:10.666 --> 1:06:14.625
I remember when I found
this spot in the woods that she loved.

1:06:15.541 --> 1:06:18.125
And I built us a house right here.

1:06:20.125 --> 1:06:21.125
Away from it all.

1:06:22.708 --> 1:06:25.208
But it wasn't gonna be
the two of us for long.

1:06:29.958 --> 1:06:30.958
<i>We wanted children.</i>

1:06:32.708 --> 1:06:33.541

1:06:36.708 --> 1:06:37.708
[both laughing]

1:06:42.458 --> 1:06:43.875
While we waited,

1:06:44.458 --> 1:06:46.125
I started making toys for them.

1:06:46.708 --> 1:06:51.125
And we waited,
and I kept making toys and more toys.

1:06:52.375 --> 1:06:54.041
Oh! Here's another one. What do you think?

1:06:54.125 --> 1:06:55.500
And we kept waiting,

1:06:56.333 --> 1:06:58.708
but they never came...

1:07:01.666 --> 1:07:02.666
And then...

1:07:05.583 --> 1:07:07.250
she got sick.

1:07:12.458 --> 1:07:15.416
Even now... sometimes...

1:07:16.375 --> 1:07:19.291
it almost feels like she's still...

1:07:23.958 --> 1:07:24.791
[sighs]

1:07:25.291 --> 1:07:28.875
After... After she was gone,

1:07:29.875 --> 1:07:32.291
I... I guess I got lost.

1:07:33.458 --> 1:07:38.625
She loved birds,
so I just kept making birdhouses.

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:41.625
But then...

1:07:42.208 --> 1:07:43.916
Then you showed up.

1:07:44.583 --> 1:07:49.166
Delivering these toys,
seeing the joy they bring to children,

1:07:49.791 --> 1:07:51.666
I thought I'd never feel this again.

1:07:52.291 --> 1:07:55.333
And I have you to thank for it, my friend.

1:07:55.916 --> 1:07:57.916
So... thank you.

1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:00.333
Of course.

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.208
-Hey, you know what? We're doing it!
-What?

1:08:04.791 --> 1:08:06.458
-Doing what?
-The Christmas thing!

1:08:06.541 --> 1:08:08.250
We're making all those toys!

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:10.041
-That's what she would've wanted.
-Really?

1:08:10.125 --> 1:08:12.791
Yeah, really!
And with a whole year of planning,

1:08:12.875 --> 1:08:15.416
-we can expand to more villages next year.
-Next year?

1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:17.291
-And more the year after that!
-But I won't...

1:08:17.375 --> 1:08:19.083
I mean, who knows
what's gonna happen next year?

1:08:19.166 --> 1:08:20.208
I might not even--

1:08:20.291 --> 1:08:23.750

Let's go! No time to lose!

1:17:35.250 --> 1:17:36.458
[crying]

1:17:37.958 --> 1:17:39.208
Cheer up, little one.

1:17:41.625 --> 1:17:43.375
I think I may have missed my boat.

1:17:44.125 --> 1:17:46.583
[gasps] Jesper!

1:17:49.666 --> 1:17:51.625
[Jesper] So I told him.
I told him everything.

1:17:52.166 --> 1:17:54.666
And then he turned to me, and he said...

1:17:54.750 --> 1:17:56.708
[chuckles] ...he'd never been
more proud of me.

1:17:57.208 --> 1:17:59.833
And he hugged me. Can you believe that?

1:17:59.916 --> 1:18:01.125
I thought he'd be mad.

1:18:01.208 --> 1:18:04.000
[speaking Saami]

1:18:04.083 --> 1:18:05.500
Well, yeah, sure. I'll miss it.

1:18:05.583 --> 1:18:09.916
The big house, the having my every whim
tended to, the silk sheets.

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.750
Oh, God, the silk sheets!
Can we change the subject?

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:15.125
[both laugh]

1:18:15.208 --> 1:18:17.666
Anyways, anybody can get off a boat.

1:18:17.750 --> 1:18:20.750
The real trick is gonna be
convincing Klaus and Alva to give me an--

1:18:21.583 --> 1:18:22.458
What? What's that?

1:18:24.875 --> 1:18:25.833
It's the clans!

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:28.958
Klaus!

1:18:32.458 --> 1:18:34.291
[man speaking Saami]

1:18:37.875 --> 1:18:38.750
[Klaus] Slowly.

1:18:39.458 --> 1:18:41.791
Slowly. Slowly.

1:18:41.875 --> 1:18:42.958
A little bit...

1:18:48.291 --> 1:18:49.458
[Mrs. Krum] Well, well.

1:18:50.125 --> 1:18:51.875
Isn't this convenient?

1:18:51.958 --> 1:18:53.208
[gasps and speaks Saami]

1:18:54.041 --> 1:18:55.291
What're you doing here?

1:18:55.375 --> 1:18:57.500
Why, we were just thinking,

1:18:57.583 --> 1:19:01.250
"Don't our children
also deserve a present?"

1:19:01.333 --> 1:19:02.583
And lookie here!

1:19:02.666 --> 1:19:05.041
You've already got her favorite thing
in the world.

1:19:05.125 --> 1:19:07.375
A nice, big piñata!

1:19:07.458 --> 1:19:09.625
-[all gasp]
-Hey, you put... [grunts]

1:19:09.708 --> 1:19:11.750
...one hand on those toys and I swear I--

1:19:11.833 --> 1:19:13.250
Stand back. All right.

1:19:13.333 --> 1:19:15.333
Do what you will with the toys.

1:19:15.416 --> 1:19:16.875
But no one gets hurt.

1:19:16.958 --> 1:19:19.208
Suits us just fine.

1:19:19.291 --> 1:19:20.416
[Magdalone and Olaf grumble]

1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:23.958
How long until children
go back to the old ways

1:19:24.041 --> 1:19:26.833
once there are no toys to bribe them with?

1:19:27.416 --> 1:19:29.958
How long until they
turn against each other?

1:19:30.791 --> 1:19:35.458
And how long until the grown-ups follow?

1:19:36.666 --> 1:19:37.750

1:19:52.708 --> 1:19:54.250
Ha! Eat our snow, you...

1:19:54.916 --> 1:19:56.875
They're not attached.
Why aren't they attached?

1:19:56.958 --> 1:19:57.958
I thought they were attached.

1:19:58.041 --> 1:20:01.083
I would never, in a million years,
have done what I just did

1:20:01.166 --> 1:20:02.541
if I didn't think these were attached.

1:20:02.625 --> 1:20:03.666
After them!

1:20:03.750 --> 1:20:07.250
Who leaves a sleigh
unattached like... Aah!

1:20:07.333 --> 1:20:08.541
Destroy those toys!

1:20:08.625 --> 1:20:10.875
-Stop them at any cost!
-Mine!

1:20:10.958 --> 1:20:13.583
Mine! Mine!

-Mine!
-[Olaf chuckling]

1:20:20.666 --> 1:20:23.583
Mine!

1:20:30.208 --> 1:20:32.541
I could really use a hand here.

1:20:32.625 --> 1:20:35.208
"Use." Interesting choice of word.

1:20:35.291 --> 1:20:37.708
Really? You're gonna
go for the guilt trip now?

1:20:37.791 --> 1:20:39.958
Smash those toys to pieces!

1:20:45.958 --> 1:20:47.250
The toys!

1:20:47.333 --> 1:20:49.666
-We have to close that bag!
-What do you care?

1:20:49.750 --> 1:20:52.791
-I thought you were leaving.
-Great. Sure. I'll tell you what.

1:20:52.875 --> 1:20:55.833
Let's continue discussing
what a horrible person I am

1:20:55.916 --> 1:20:59.291
while I most likely break my neck
trying to save the children's toys,

1:20:59.375 --> 1:21:01.458
-why don't we?
-Get down there!

1:21:01.541 --> 1:21:03.208
-Stop those toys!

Hmm.

1:21:12.458 --> 1:21:13.791
[all scream]

1:21:17.041 --> 1:21:20.041
Nice move! How'd you know
I wouldn't get knocked off too?

1:21:20.125 --> 1:21:21.833
Never mind. Don't answer that.

1:21:21.916 --> 1:21:22.875

Go! Go! We're dead!
We're dead! We're dead!

1:21:35.291 --> 1:21:37.458
I'm still proud of you, you hear me?

-It's not worth it!
-Are you crazy? No!

1:22:38.666 --> 1:22:39.500

See? Nothing to it. Just...

1:22:43.125 --> 1:22:45.416
[Mrs. Krum] I wouldn't be so sure.

1:22:47.458 --> 1:22:48.958
Wait! No, no, no!

1:22:49.458 --> 1:22:54.791
No! No, no, no! No!

1:23:00.916 --> 1:23:05.083
This town was built
on resentment and spite.

1:23:05.166 --> 1:23:08.083
And it'll stay that way
as long as a Krum...

1:23:08.166 --> 1:23:09.375
Or an Ellingboe!

1:23:09.458 --> 1:23:10.291
Ugh.

1:23:10.375 --> 1:23:12.750
...have something to say about it.

1:23:13.250 --> 1:23:16.000
Let's go. We're done here.

1:23:16.083 --> 1:23:18.833
[Mr. Ellingboe] Well said.
Wait, does that mean the feud is back on?

1:23:18.916 --> 1:23:20.166
No more truce?

1:23:20.250 --> 1:23:21.666
[Mrs. Krum] First thing tomorrow.

1:23:22.791 --> 1:23:24.416
[Jesper] A true act of goodwill.

1:23:25.416 --> 1:23:26.416
What was that?

1:23:27.833 --> 1:23:28.666
[grunting]

1:23:31.291 --> 1:23:33.583
A true act of goodwill...

1:23:34.625 --> 1:23:36.333
always sparks another.

1:23:37.041 --> 1:23:39.375
I think you hit your head
pretty hard, dear.

1:23:39.458 --> 1:23:40.916
You should lie back down.

1:23:41.500 --> 1:23:43.916
You don't believe me? Turn around.

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.125
What?

1:23:45.750 --> 1:23:46.833
Turn around.

1:23:50.833 --> 1:23:52.083
-Mine.

-Drop that immediately!
-Mine!

1:23:55.291 --> 1:23:57.166
-[Mrs. Krum] Honey! Sweetie!
-Let go and come back here right now.

1:23:57.250 --> 1:23:58.875
-[Mrs. Krum] Get down from there!
-[Magdalone] Mine!

1:23:58.958 --> 1:23:59.791
[Mrs. Krum] It's Mama calling.

1:23:59.875 --> 1:24:01.583
-[Mr. Ellingboe] Put the boy down.
-[Mrs. Krum] Remember Mama?

1:24:01.666 --> 1:24:03.541
[Mr. Ellingboe] You don't know
where he's been.

1:24:03.625 --> 1:24:05.333
Klaus, I don't know what to say.

1:24:05.916 --> 1:24:06.875
If I hadn't...

1:24:06.958 --> 1:24:07.791
[thumps]

1:24:11.708 --> 1:24:12.750
What's this?

1:24:20.750 --> 1:24:23.041
The presents in the sleigh were all fake?

1:24:23.125 --> 1:24:24.958
[Klaus] Give me a little credit. [grunts]

1:24:25.041 --> 1:24:27.166
I wasn't going to let them have the toys.

1:24:27.250 --> 1:24:29.666
-But how did you know that--
-Kids talk, you know?

1:24:29.750 --> 1:24:31.375
And if kids happen to be talking

1:24:31.458 --> 1:24:33.958
about their parents plotting to form
an angry mob,

1:24:34.041 --> 1:24:35.583
then, you know, teachers listen.

1:24:35.666 --> 1:24:36.875
It was a simple plan.

1:24:37.458 --> 1:24:40.833
[grunts] They would destroy
the decoys and leave.

1:24:40.916 --> 1:24:44.041
But then you showed up
and made it complicated. As usual.

1:24:44.125 --> 1:24:45.750
So, all this was for nothing?

1:24:46.541 --> 1:24:48.625
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:54.500
Shall we then?

1:25:15.833 --> 1:25:17.583

-Yeah!
-Mine's the big one!

1:25:23.166 --> 1:25:25.458
I told you! I told you he would come!

1:25:25.541 --> 1:25:27.333

1:25:28.166 --> 1:25:29.333
-Yes!
-Yeah!

-It's just what I wanted!
-He came! He came! He came!
