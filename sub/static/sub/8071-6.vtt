Roseanne?

00:45.446 --> 00:46.247
Dan?

00:52.786 --> 00:53.587
It's Kathy.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.534
Is-- is everything OK?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.281
Hello?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.695
Is anybody ho--

01:37.298 --> 01:40.201
[bloodcurdling scream]

01:45.005 --> 01:46.274
What is it, Kathy?

01:46.374 --> 01:47.841
I've had a really
bad day, and now I

01:47.941 --> 01:51.612
got all this cleaning up to do.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.081
I-- I--

01:54.182 --> 01:55.216
I need to go home.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.150
I--

01:56.250 --> 01:57.451
Would you just
look at this mess?

01:57.551 --> 02:00.621
I-- I don't know how many
times I've said it to myself.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.824
It's just like gutting a fish.

02:03.924 --> 02:07.695
I swear, I was way
better the last time.

02:07.795 --> 02:08.896
The last time?

02:08.996 --> 02:09.797
Yeah.

02:09.897 --> 02:10.898
You know, with Becky's dad.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.200
He was blond, too.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.067
Hey, I know.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.604
You've got a garbage disposal
over at your house, don't you?

02:16.704 --> 02:17.738
Oh, my God!

02:17.838 --> 02:18.672
Please.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.573
Please.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.409
I-- I need to go home.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.077
Oh, no, you can't go.
You'll tell.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.179
No, I won't.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.780
I promise I won't tell.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.317
Please let me go.

[screaming]

02:34.722 --> 02:36.089
Happy Halloween.

02:42.029 --> 02:49.370
That was a horrible,
horrible, horrible thing to do.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.774
You know, hon,
every time we do this,

02:53.874 --> 02:55.843
people get so ticked off.

02:55.943 --> 02:56.744
Yeah.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.379

[theme music]

03:52.366 --> 03:54.468
Boy, we got Kathy good.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.836
She almost lost it.

03:55.936 --> 03:56.837
Yeah.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.807
Damn good bladder
control, though.

03:59.907 --> 04:00.908
Well, thank you.

04:01.008 --> 04:04.845
I did laugh pretty hard.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.947
Listen, I'm going out tonight.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.316
Oh, you going to
be home for dinner?

04:08.416 --> 04:09.216
Well, I don't know.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.117
What are we having?

04:10.217 --> 04:12.820
BOTH: Liver.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.489
God, I wish I had
an adult role model.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.624
DAN: Where you going tonight?

04:16.724 --> 04:18.359
Yeah, you got some sort
of a party or something?

04:18.459 --> 04:19.960
What are you going as?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.362
I'm going as Becky.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.097
That ought to scare
the crap out of them.

04:24.197 --> 04:24.998
Funny.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.199
Anyway, it's not a party.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.435
It's a movie.
- Ooh.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.469
Scary movie?

04:28.569 --> 04:29.770
Mother, I've outgrown it.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.505
Move on.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.906
Ah.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.207
How's about you, Darlene?

04:34.308 --> 04:37.611
Are you going to dress up
all gross for Mommy tonight?

04:37.711 --> 04:40.848
No, I think I'm just
going to stay home.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.149
What's wrong
with you, Darlene?

04:42.249 --> 04:44.184
You used to care
about Halloween.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.286
Yeah, I also used to
want to marry Scott Baio.

04:52.225 --> 04:55.062
Oh, you look great!

04:55.162 --> 04:56.196
Who am I supposed to be?

04:59.867 --> 05:00.868
I told you, honey.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.203
You're Alfalfa of
"The Little Rascals".

05:03.303 --> 05:05.573
I want to be the Terminator.

05:05.673 --> 05:06.474
No!

05:06.574 --> 05:07.375
No, DJ.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.076
Everybody's the Terminator .

05:09.176 --> 05:10.210
You look cute.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.979
I don't wanna look cute.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.947
Honey, let me.

05:14.047 --> 05:18.118
DJ, Alfalfas kill Terminators.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.987
Yeah, right.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.021
No.
No, really.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.022
Really.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.657
See, this is your
antenna, you know,

05:23.757 --> 05:26.994
and it detects Terminator waves.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.396
Mom, why don't
you just give him

05:28.496 --> 05:30.864
a sign to wear that says, "Knock
me down and steal my candy."

05:34.935 --> 05:37.270
I wanna do what my
friends are doing.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.338
Well, fine.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.640
Then you just do
whatever the hell you

05:39.740 --> 05:42.510
want and leave me out of it.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.244
I just don't get
it anymore, Dan.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.646
Yeah.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.549
I remember when Halloween used
to mean something around here.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.486
Remember when we used to
throw flaming bags of dog doo

05:52.586 --> 05:55.055
over on the Hendersons'
lawn as a family?

05:55.155 --> 05:55.956
[sighs]

05:56.056 --> 05:57.224
Hey.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.559
Oh, good.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.529
Jackie can help you yank
the slime out of this thing.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.264
I gotta go get some more
tubing for our costume.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.198
Your costume's got tubing?

06:05.298 --> 06:06.600
Maybe, maybe not.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.368
Why won't you tell me what
you're going as tonight?

06:08.469 --> 06:10.303
Because we've been working
on it for months, Jackie.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.338
It's supposed to be a surprise.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.073
I told you what I
was going to go as.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.908
Yeah, Morticia Addams.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.410
Not too boring.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.779
I'm sorry if it's not up
to your standards, Roseanne.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.247
Hey, if you give
me a half an hour,

06:20.347 --> 06:24.418
I will turn you into a science
experiment gone berserk.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.819
No, thanks.

06:25.919 --> 06:26.720
Sorry.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.221
What's with the blood?

06:28.321 --> 06:30.658
Oh, I killed Dan.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.460
Of course.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.528
So are you still going
to the thing tonight alone?

06:34.628 --> 06:35.429
Yeah.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.230
No date.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.932
Are you bummed?

06:39.032 --> 06:40.100
Well, no.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.769
Not now.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.336
Soon?

06:43.437 --> 06:44.404
No.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.607
I mean, I was bummed
about it, you know,

06:46.707 --> 06:49.510
like around the time
of the Arnie disaster.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.179
I was so desperate for
company, I actually called up

06:52.279 --> 06:53.447
some of my old boyfriends.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.347
Ew!

06:54.448 --> 06:55.282
That's pathetic.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.617
Thanks.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.785
Well, who'd you call?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.119
Oh, I don't even--
ROSEANNE: No, who?

06:59.219 --> 07:00.353
Who?
JACKIE: --wanna get-- Gary.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.254
Oh, God!

07:01.354 --> 07:02.856
And I hung up.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.157
Cool.
And?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.058
Tim Brewer.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.627
Who, that mama's boy?

07:06.727 --> 07:07.595
She answered.

07:07.695 --> 07:12.500
Although, it could've been him.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.167
Man, I'm glad that
one never worked out.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.068
Yeah.

07:15.168 --> 07:15.969
Then I called Booker.

07:16.069 --> 07:16.870
Booker?

07:16.970 --> 07:17.771
Ooh, what'd he have to say?

07:17.871 --> 07:18.772
Nothing.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.040
I just left a message
on his machine.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.409
Look, I don't-- I don't even
want to get into it, OK?

07:22.510 --> 07:23.711
I'm going by myself.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.113
I don't need to bring a
date to have a good time.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.347
All right.
Yeah.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.182
So you're just going
to like get drunk

07:29.282 --> 07:31.218
and hang around me all night.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.886
You mind?

07:32.986 --> 07:33.787
DJ: Mom.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.694
Where are my hand grenades?

07:40.794 --> 07:41.895
In your bottom drawer.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.631
Where else would they be?

07:43.731 --> 07:44.532
Oh, yeah.

07:44.632 --> 07:45.432
Right.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.103
Who's he supposed to be?

07:50.203 --> 07:52.172
I don't know.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.373
The Alfalfa-nater.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.157
He did the monsters mash.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.659
The monster mash.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.627
It was a graveyard smash.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.628
He did the mash.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.097
It caught on in a flash.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.065
He did the mash.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.033
He did the monster mash.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.941
Well, I see two women
who should have consulted

08:28.041 --> 08:29.476
before choosing their costumes.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.680
Crystal, you knew I was
borrowing Roseanne's wig.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.014
How could you do this?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.316
Well, how did I know you were
borrowing it for Halloween?

08:36.416 --> 08:38.051
What did you think
I wanted it for?

08:38.151 --> 08:39.953
Why, I certainly don't know.

08:40.053 --> 08:44.424
Perhaps you were trying to
cover your hair color du jour.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.325
Hey.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.161
Let's not get snippy.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.296
I'm sorry.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.599
But I put a lot of
thought into this costume.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.534
Well, so did I.
Oh, what are the odds

08:54.635 --> 08:56.503
we'd both come as Morticia?

08:56.604 --> 08:57.705
Oh, you're Morticia?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.539
Well, then that's no problem.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.710
I'm Elvira.

you, but Elvis' ghost is here.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.122
Did he see me?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.256
I don't think so.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.058
But I wouldn't hang near
the free food too long.

09:18.158 --> 09:18.959
OK, right.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.031
I can't believe you
both came as Cher.

ARNIE: Jackie!
Jackie!

09:29.536 --> 09:31.404

be coming onto me.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.313
You understand?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.183
I think I can
control myself, Arnie.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.351
I really appreciate it.
Whoa!

09:44.451 --> 09:45.418
She's seen us.

Quick, act like you
never slept with me.

get a seat, please?

Thank you.

Everybody, thank you.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.210
be Halloween unless

Lanford?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.091
Say, isn't that Arnie?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.861
I thought I told
you to go to hell.

11:00.961 --> 11:01.795
No, Morty.

11:01.895 --> 11:02.763
These are our friends.

11:02.863 --> 11:03.663
Why, look.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.298
Isn't that Jackie over there?

11:05.398 --> 11:07.935
Say, I hear she's
a truck driver now.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.336
Well, that's a switch.

11:09.436 --> 11:13.106
Jackie in the front seat
with her feet on the floor.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.041
Hey!

11:14.141 --> 11:16.343
Hey!

11:16.443 --> 11:17.711
Are you ready to
do our little song?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.512
ARNIE: Oh, God.
Don't let her sing!

11:19.612 --> 11:21.581
Shut up, Arnie.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.050
Hit it, Deadgar.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.617
Da-da da-dun-da da-da.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.186
(SINGING) Well, I
come from six feet

11:26.286 --> 11:28.688
under with a dead
guy on my knee.

11:28.789 --> 11:32.625
I'm heading down to Hades
for to spend eternity.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.963
Hey, there, Deadgar, I
think it's plain to see.

11:36.063 --> 11:40.233
We bought a cardboard casket
and now worms have eaten me.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.719
Well, you won the
grand prize again.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.588
Was there ever any doubt?

12:01.688 --> 12:02.622
50 bucks.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.556
Wow.

12:03.656 --> 12:06.359
What'd the costume
cost you, 100?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.561
Well, we don't do
it for the money, OK?

12:08.661 --> 12:11.298
We do it for the envy.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.734
Well, you were a
convincing dummy.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.236
Jealous, jealous, jealous.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.370
Honey.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.439
Honey, look who's here.
ROSEANNE: Oh, my God.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.808
It's the Bowmans.

12:20.908 --> 12:24.111
I wonder how he managed to
drag her down to the Lodge.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.047
Wait a minute, Dan.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.381
I know why she's here.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.617
She's here to try to get us
back for what we did today.

12:30.717 --> 12:31.684
No way.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.420
I'm serious, Dan.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.554
She hates the Lodge.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.323
The only reason she'd
ever show up on our turf

12:36.423 --> 12:39.793
is just to try to humiliate us
in front of all of our friends.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.261
Too bad she
didn't see the act.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.529
Could've saved her a trip.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.139
Stay alert, Dan.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.307
Kathy's over there
plotting revenge.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.676
But at least we know about
it, so we've got the edge.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.378
Honey, you're
just being paranoid.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.647
Why can't you just relax
and have a good time?

13:00.747 --> 13:01.982
I am not being paranoid.

13:02.082 --> 13:02.883
Look at that.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.484
They've got Crystal in on it.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.752
DAN: So she's
talking to Crystal.

13:05.853 --> 13:06.653
Big deal.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.921
She's just being sociable.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.056
Oh, right.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.224
When have you ever known
Kathy to be sociable?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.460
Well, OK.
We pull one on her.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.394
She pulls one on us.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.528
We're even.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.697
I don't want to be even, Dan.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.666
I want to be better.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.501
So just watch your back.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.403
Fine.
I'll be at the bar.

13:23.503 --> 13:27.674
If I'm not back in 15
minutes, I'll be at the bar.

13:27.774 --> 13:28.641
Roseanne.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.543
Roseanne, I met this guy.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.845
He seems really great.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.113
But he's in this
big moose costume,

13:33.213 --> 13:35.348
and no matter what I say,
he won't take the hat off.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.589
You listening to me?

13:42.689 --> 13:44.124
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.025
You met a moose.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.126
Congratulations.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.161
What's with you?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.998
See that Little Miss
Yarnhead over there?

13:51.098 --> 13:53.266
Well, she don't know
who she's messing with.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.068
I am the master.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.338
All's I've got to do is think.

13:58.438 --> 14:02.142
If I were her, what
would I do to get even?

14:06.379 --> 14:07.847
Oh-ho, that bitch.

14:15.055 --> 14:18.058
So I said to myself, I
don't care if it sounds crazy.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.426
It's my life.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.828
If I want to be a trucker, then
that's what's right for me.

14:21.929 --> 14:22.729
That's great.

14:22.829 --> 14:23.630
You're independent.

14:23.730 --> 14:24.597
You get to travel.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.399
It's perfect for you.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.335
How do you know
it's perfect for me?

14:28.435 --> 14:29.702
I just got this
feeling about you.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.104
I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.906
Take off the mask.
- I told you.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.075
You might be disappointed, and
I don't want that to happen

14:35.175 --> 14:36.343
until after we've had sex.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.948
You're pretty
sure of yourself.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.917
Well, hunting season starts
tomorrow, so it's now or never.

14:44.017 --> 14:44.884
No!

14:44.985 --> 14:47.988
Take off the moose head.
- All right.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.090
But you-- you've really been
digging me up until now.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.594
Trick or treat.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.363
Booker?

14:56.463 --> 14:57.364
I got your call.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.265
Damn it.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.867
I thought it was somebody good.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.335
BOOKER: Jackie--

15:02.435 --> 15:03.670
JERRY: Hey, Dan.

15:03.770 --> 15:04.604
Hey, Jer.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.973
Hey, where's Rosie?

15:06.073 --> 15:07.140
Well, where's Kathy?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.875
Oh, she went out to
the car to get a sweater.

15:08.976 --> 15:12.045
Then Rosie would be out
in the bushes, watching her.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.014
She thinks Kathy's going to
get even with us for that trick

15:14.114 --> 15:15.748
we pulled on her.
- Oh, boy.

15:15.848 --> 15:16.749
I've got to tell you, Dan.

15:16.849 --> 15:17.884
Kathy was so mad
about that she didn't

15:17.985 --> 15:19.352
say a word to me all day.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.653
Well, I guess you
owe me a beer, Jer.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.889
Yeah, I guess I do.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.491
Gus.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.392
Wait a minute, now.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.593
I don't understand.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.461
Why did you call me if
you didn't want to see me?

15:28.561 --> 15:31.764
It was not a happy time
at Jackie's that night, OK?

15:31.864 --> 15:34.234
I wanted to talk to someone
who was not my sister.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.135
All right.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.803
So you needed to
talk to someone.

15:36.903 --> 15:37.704
Here I am.

15:37.804 --> 15:38.838
Let's talk.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.240
You weren't the only
guy I called, you know.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.809
No, but I'm the only
one that showed up.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.277
- We don't know that.
- Mhm.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.612
There is someone
in there right

15:45.712 --> 15:49.816
now dressed as Madonna who
could very well be Tim Brewer.

15:49.916 --> 15:50.883
I made a mistake, all right?

15:50.984 --> 15:52.285
Let's just forget it.
- Come here.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.353
Come here.
Sit down.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.587
There's something
that I've been wanting

15:54.687 --> 15:56.389
to ask you since we broke up.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.261
Why'd we break up?

16:01.361 --> 16:03.063
You were seeing somebody else.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.599
So it was my fault.
I was afraid of that.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.468
JACKIE: Hi, Kathy.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.237
Your sister is insane.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.574
Roseanne's new neighbor.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.942
Ah.

16:16.043 --> 16:16.876
Hey!

16:16.976 --> 16:17.777
Hey, hey!

16:17.877 --> 16:18.845
Booker!

16:18.945 --> 16:20.180
Oh, man.
Look, Jackie.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.481
It's Booker.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.415
Booker was the moose.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.316
JACKIE: I know.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.284
Hey, how you been?

16:24.384 --> 16:25.218
You look great.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.586
What have you been up to?
- Well--

16:26.686 --> 16:27.954
Oh, I can't talk to you now.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.366
Jerry, let's go home.

16:39.466 --> 16:40.267
Bye, Dan.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.168
Bye, Jer.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.502
Oh, leaving so soon, Kathy?

16:42.602 --> 16:45.572
Or is that just what
you want me to think?

16:45.672 --> 16:48.441
Roseanne, why are
you following me?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.443
What were you
doing at your car?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.479
Getting my sweater.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.215
Why were you doing that?

16:55.315 --> 16:58.651
To get away from you.

16:58.751 --> 17:02.055
So then what are you doing
here in the first place?

17:02.155 --> 17:08.661
Because my husband asked
me to come, so I did.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.498
Married people do things
like that for one another.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.967
Oh, don't make me laugh.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.270
How many times do I have
to tell you, Roseanne,

17:17.370 --> 17:20.140
that I'm not going to
waste one iota of energy

17:20.240 --> 17:21.941
in getting you back?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.810
I think I'm better than that.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.378
Jerry, come.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.279
Bye, Dan.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.948
Bye, Jer.

17:29.048 --> 17:29.916
Oh, sure.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.818
You think you're
better than me now,

17:31.918 --> 17:33.353
but when you remember
the terrible thing

17:33.453 --> 17:35.322
that I did to you
today, you will

17:35.422 --> 17:36.956
sink to my level like a rock!

17:44.564 --> 17:47.400
Now, why wouldn't she get
me back after I got her?

17:47.500 --> 17:48.835
What, is something
wrong with me?

17:48.935 --> 17:50.737
Am I not good enough to get?

17:50.837 --> 17:52.705
Is she trying to make
me feel like I'm, what?

17:52.805 --> 17:53.606
What?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.142
Beneath revenge?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.243
She ruined your
favorite night.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.477
Maybe that's her payback.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.578
No, Dan.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.281
She doesn't have that
kind of imagination.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.584
She'll do something to get me
back, and it'll be really lame.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.119
And I'll be ready for it, too.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.721
I'm sure you will be, dear.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.090
You know, Dan, I just wish we
would've rehearsed the act more

18:11.191 --> 18:12.559
because I don't think
people got that we

18:12.659 --> 18:14.127
were supposed to be dead.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.995
Well, Morty, if
it's any consolation,

18:16.095 --> 18:17.096
I'm sure they wish we were.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.498
Yeah.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.399
Whoa!

18:19.499 --> 18:20.700
No!

18:20.800 --> 18:21.668
Yah!
Yow!

18:21.768 --> 18:23.069
Yow!
Yow!

18:23.170 --> 18:24.103
Yow!
Yow!

18:24.204 --> 18:25.472
- What's going on?
- Snakes.

18:25.572 --> 18:26.439
Snakes in the bed.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.175
And we just bought
that bed, too.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.842
Now it's covered all with
snake sweat and stuff.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.710
You go get them out of there.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.611
No, you get them out.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.612
No, you're the man!

18:32.712 --> 18:34.481
Ick!

18:34.581 --> 18:36.816
She's gone too far this time.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.618
Snakes bite and squeeze.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.153
Kathy's trying to kill us.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.888
What are you talking about?

18:41.988 --> 18:44.691
Kathy isn't trying to kill you.
- Yeah, we are.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.663
You put snakes in our bed?

18:50.763 --> 18:51.898
Well, you were
saying how important

18:51.998 --> 18:53.400
this Halloween stuff is to you.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.170
My babies.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.710
You've made your
mother and me very happy.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.545
Now get rid of the snakes.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.779
I'll do it!

19:06.879 --> 19:08.315
DJ, don't touch those snakes.

19:08.415 --> 19:11.751
I'm not untying them again.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.019
Oh!

19:13.119 --> 19:16.856
Our beautiful children
remembered us on the holiday.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.158
God bless us, one and all.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.594
To think you had to
worry about Kathy.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.763
Yeah.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.999
Of course, you know
what this means, Dan.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.835
She's still out there.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.803
[howling]

19:42.882 --> 19:45.385
Now all she has to
do is pick up the box.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.389
OK.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.191
It'll all be over in
a couple of seconds.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.761
I can't believe you're going
to do this to your own wife.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.762
I'm not doing it.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.530
Kathy is.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.132
When it's done, Roseanne
will sleep better.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.137
Ah.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.840
I'll sleep better.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.941
Life will be good.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.443
Or at least normal.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.444
Do you have the kitten?

20:11.544 --> 20:14.180
I have the kitten.

20:14.281 --> 20:17.550
[meowing]

20:24.424 --> 20:27.093
DAN: OK, there she is, ever
vigilant and ever paranoid.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.095
She spots the bait.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.030
And realizing how
lame the trick is

20:31.130 --> 20:36.736
and how easy it was to
detect, waves of superiority

20:36.836 --> 20:39.439
wash over her.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.440
What now?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.708
One of two things.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.344
Either she just won't
open the door, or--

20:44.444 --> 20:47.146
ROSEANNE: Becky, it's for you.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.548
Perfect.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.616
She gets even for the snakes.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.988
What do you guys do for
Thanksgiving around here?

20:56.088 --> 20:56.889
[door opening]

20:57.590 --> 20:58.391
BECKY: Oh, look!

20:58.491 --> 20:59.292
A little kitty.

21:02.995 --> 21:06.866
[music playing]
