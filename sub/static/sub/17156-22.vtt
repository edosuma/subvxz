[Spike sighs] Didn't we
just shelve all the books

00:04.472 --> 00:07.072
in the library a few
months ago?

00:07.074 --> 00:09.408
Yes, but that was
because we needed to;

00:09.410 --> 00:11.477
this is just
because I want to:

00:11.479 --> 00:13.579
I call it my
booksortcation.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.215
Three uninterrupted days
of re-organizing books!

00:16.217 --> 00:18.350
Can you think of
anything more relaxing?

00:18.352 --> 00:21.787
Well, claw massages, back
rubs, bubble baths...

00:23.790 --> 00:26.392
You weren't really looking
for an answer, were you.

00:26.394 --> 00:29.261
I've even devised a better
system for organizing them.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.764
It decreases the amount of
time it takes to find the book

00:31.766 --> 00:34.199
you're looking for by
nearly 3/4 of a second.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.268
Whoa! That much?

00:37.405 --> 00:42.241
Why there must be at least
20,000 books to organize.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.776
Whoooo!

00:43.778 --> 00:46.278
Best long weekend ever!

00:48.681 --> 00:51.517
I'm sure we can make some
time for a claw massage

00:51.519 --> 00:53.285
and a back rub, too.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.754
Yes! Best long weekend ever!

very productive days!

Hi, Rainbow Dash.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.609
Good to see you, Discord.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.777
Did you rehearse
before you found us?

02:25.779 --> 02:28.347
What makes you
think we practiced?

Oh, Twilight, we've simply
had a momentous time together

02:45.332 --> 02:47.733
these past three days.

You could say it was

Good one, Discord!

03:05.785 --> 03:07.219
It is?

03:07.221 --> 03:10.589
Kind of an inside joke
from this weekend.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.958
You wouldn't really get
it unless you were there.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.260
Oh. OK.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.863
Cool. Well, uh, catch
you later, Twilight.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.867
Catch you later, Twilight.

03:28.742 --> 03:33.745
Since when have Rainbow Dash
and Discord had "inside jokes"?

03:33.747 --> 03:37.382
Since sometime in the
last three days, I guess.

03:37.384 --> 03:41.286
Hey! Nopony made you join
me on my booksortcation.

03:41.288 --> 03:42.821

Twilight! You've returned from
your book-sorting sabbatical.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.899
All that organizing has done
wonders for your complexion.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.568
Thanks. It was
very relaxing.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.571
And we were able
to clear a shelf

03:59.573 --> 04:01.473
for those old-fashioned
books you wanted to donate.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.810
They're not old, darling;
they're vintage.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.846
And they're over there. I've
even included my favorites

04:07.848 --> 04:12.284
by former Canterlot Designer
to the stars, Rococo Froufrou.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.419
Ooh, I love her.

were at Sweet Apple Acres...

05:03.337 --> 05:06.038
And oh, how to explain...

05:06.040 --> 05:08.840
Well, let me try and paint
her a picture, dearest.

I simply can't do it justice.
You really had to be there.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.360
We would have invited
you to come along too,

05:28.362 --> 05:30.495
but we didn't want to
interrupt your organizing.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.431
We know how important
it is to you.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.966
And I'm sure it was
much more important

05:34.968 --> 05:39.771
than the fun that we had.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.440
I appreciate that.

up in your castle.

sharing that experience

Princess of Friendship duties.

If our friends could enjoy
three full days with Discord

08:07.154 --> 08:09.187

something to do with

08:09.189 --> 08:11.089
the specific things
they did together.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.124
If we could find out
what those things were,

08:13.126 --> 08:15.994
it could be a real breakthrough
in the science of friendship.

Oh, but we must. It's
for the greater good.

09:02.676 --> 09:06.811
It started when we were helping
Granny Smith with her garden.

09:06.813 --> 09:10.215
Uh, I reckon you mean
my sister, Apple Bloom.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.251
Oh. All you Apples
look the same.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.721
And then Rainbow
Dash saw a snake.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.057
I think it was a garden hose.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.960
It was a "Hose
Snake." Super Deadly.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.195
I recall it being a large stick

09:24.197 --> 09:26.765
that looked like a hose
that in turn did in fact

09:26.767 --> 09:28.199
resemble a snake.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.569
Point is WE galloped away!

09:30.571 --> 09:32.571
And it chased after us!

09:32.573 --> 09:34.906

Oooh. Are you suggesting--

09:51.158 --> 09:52.891

09:52.893 --> 09:57.762
Absolutely not! Time travel is
not something to be messed with.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.631
We simply need to
recreate everything

09:59.633 --> 10:01.366

10:01.368 --> 10:04.603
Oh! What a brilliant idea!

Yes?

The tablecloth. It
isn't the same color

10:44.344 --> 10:47.312
as the one the restaurant
used on the day in question.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.115
Really?

10:50.117 --> 10:53.118
He's right. The
tablecloth was red.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.954
I remember because it clashed
with the font on the menus.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.756
I don't suppose that
means we're gonna need

10:57.758 --> 10:59.324

10:59.326 --> 11:01.760
Oh, most definitely.

Are you sure there's not
something you've missed?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.930
Some other detail about
your lunch together

12:11.932 --> 12:14.933
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you,

12:14.935 --> 12:17.102
but I feel we've been pretty
exhaustive in our attempts

12:17.104 --> 12:21.239
to recreate every single detail
of our previous encounter.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.975
[agreeing chatter]

12:23.977 --> 12:26.845
Yeah, Twilight. If you
don't get it by now,

12:26.847 --> 12:28.947
I don't think you're
ever gonna get it.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.349
But it is really important
that I figure this out.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.384
It's for the good
of all Equestria.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.186
Well, perhaps we should
have another look

12:35.188 --> 12:37.789
at the data we've collected.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.058
[gasp] Of course!

12:40.060 --> 12:43.495
There is one last variable
that we haven't accounted for.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.462
What?

12:45.264 --> 12:46.464
You!

12:47.900 --> 12:49.067
Me?

12:49.069 --> 12:51.236
You weren't there observing us.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.372
No matter how hard we try,
we can't possibly recreate

12:54.374 --> 12:57.442
our weekend of fun
exactly as it happened

12:57.444 --> 13:00.879
because you'll always be
watching and you weren't there.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.182
He makes a good point.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.986
It has only served to prove that
moments of levity and bonding

13:07.988 --> 13:12.090
between friends simply
cannot be recreated

13:12.092 --> 13:15.994
so that others might
share in the experience.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.796
He makes another good point.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.330
Oh, don't worry, darling;

13:19.332 --> 13:22.033
I'm sure there'll be plenty of
other chances for you to share

13:22.035 --> 13:24.035
in the kind of frivolity
we had with Discord

13:24.037 --> 13:25.436
while you were away.

13:25.438 --> 13:30.108
Yeah. And I'll bet they'll
be just as...hissssterical.

13:30.110 --> 13:34.846
[laughter]

13:34.848 --> 13:36.214
Absolutely.

13:39.852 --> 13:42.020
I'm not buying it.
Not for a second.

13:42.022 --> 13:45.256
There is definitely something
else going on here, Spike.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.258
Or maybe there isn't
and you should just drop

13:47.260 --> 13:49.427
this whole thing and admit
that you're a little jealous?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.596
Even if I'm not able to
laugh at what happened,

13:51.598 --> 13:54.299
I should be able to figure
out why they find it funny.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.367
Why they think they had
this amazing and hilarious

13:56.369 --> 13:57.902
time together.

13:57.904 --> 14:01.139
But I can't figure it out.
It doesn't make sense.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.241
Some things just
can't be explained.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.310
Our friends think something
great happened to them

14:05.312 --> 14:08.546
while I was away. But no!
It was something awful!

14:09.849 --> 14:11.482
If we don't break the
spell they're under,

14:11.484 --> 14:13.251
who knows what terrible
things could happen?

14:13.253 --> 14:15.053
Spell?

14:15.055 --> 14:17.055
Come on, Spike! There's
no time to lose!

14:21.961 --> 14:25.396
Zecora, what do you think?
Can you undo Discord's magic?

14:25.398 --> 14:28.466
[bubbling]

14:28.468 --> 14:33.304
In what way can you tell that
they are indeed under a spell?

14:33.306 --> 14:36.374
They're having fun with
Discord; that's why.

14:36.376 --> 14:40.578
Ahh, a friendship with
Discord is truly a shock

14:40.580 --> 14:43.581
but who says it is something
that we must block?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.617
Trust me, they would
never laugh like that

14:45.619 --> 14:48.887
unless something magical was
involved. It's not that funny.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.521
I know funny.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.030
All right, this potion
will break the spell

14:59.032 --> 15:01.499
then you will be able to tell.

15:01.501 --> 15:06.004
Wait, if that's the potion, then
what's brewing in your cauldron?

15:06.006 --> 15:09.974
It ties the room together
and emits a warm glow

15:09.976 --> 15:13.544
but if I am to be honest,
it's just for show!

15:13.546 --> 15:18.483
♪

15:18.485 --> 15:20.051
[yawn]

15:20.053 --> 15:22.387
I wonder why she asked us
here so bright and early.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.022
Another map adventure perhaps?

15:28.994 --> 15:31.696
Nope. No glowing tushies here.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.499
Maybe it's more of
a non-adventure.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.669
Maybe she just wants to tell us
how last night's slumber went.

15:37.671 --> 15:39.137
Hey, gang!

15:39.139 --> 15:41.239
Ooh, you look excited.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.676
I am excited! We're
gonna have fun today!

15:44.678 --> 15:46.377
Yes!

15:46.379 --> 15:49.480
Just one tiny, miniscule,
microscopic thing

15:49.482 --> 15:51.049
before fun times.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.117
I need everypony
to sip this potion

15:53.119 --> 15:55.019
to break Discord's spell on you.

15:56.222 --> 16:01.125
Don't be embarrassed. So what
if Discord cast a spell on you

16:01.127 --> 16:02.994
so you THOUGHT you
had a great time

16:02.996 --> 16:04.629
and now you have all
these inside jokes

16:04.631 --> 16:07.598
that you seem to be
constantly laughing at.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.502
Don't worry, you didn't have
your defenses up; I get it.

16:13.974 --> 16:18.643
Twilight, darling, we simply
had a nice time with Discord.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.712
As I recall, we spent much
of yesterday afternoon

16:20.714 --> 16:22.680
re-enacting it for you.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.417
Uh-huh. Or you re-enacted
what you thought was fun

16:26.419 --> 16:29.053
but really wasn't because
you were under a spell

16:29.055 --> 16:32.123
that made you think
what happened was fun.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.560
What kind of fertilizer have
you had your nose in, Twilight?

16:35.562 --> 16:38.229
Be honest; the only reason
you won't drink the potion

16:38.231 --> 16:40.732
is because deep down in your
hearts you know there's a chance

16:40.734 --> 16:42.500
that Discord has
you under his power.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.570
Twilight! How could
you say such a thing?

16:45.572 --> 16:48.172
I know Discord still
makes mistakes sometimes,

16:48.174 --> 16:51.309
but you're accusing him
of being downright evil.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.078
Yeah! And to top it
off, you're accusing us

16:54.080 --> 16:56.547
of not being able to tell
he was up to something.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.182
What do you take us for?

16:58.184 --> 17:02.153
Yeah. What do
you... take us for?

17:04.356 --> 17:07.191
Delicious! Got any
more, Twilight?

17:07.193 --> 17:09.060
Hi, Twilight.

17:09.062 --> 17:12.497
The gang mentioned we'd all be
hanging out together today.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.065
The gang?

17:14.067 --> 17:17.568
Yeah, the peanut
butter hoof gang!

17:17.570 --> 17:20.671
[tapping]

17:20.673 --> 17:22.306
[giggling]

17:22.308 --> 17:23.741
It's still funny!

17:25.411 --> 17:27.345
So much for that
whole spell theory.

17:27.347 --> 17:32.316
[laughter continues]

17:32.318 --> 17:35.420
Ugh! It's still not funny!

17:35.422 --> 17:37.288
It's funny if you were there.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.825
[yelling] But I wasn't there!
I wasn't included.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.627
Maybe it's my own
fault for staying in

17:42.629 --> 17:44.629
and having a booksortacation
when I could have been

17:44.631 --> 17:46.664
making jokes and memories
with my friends.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.700
But I didn't do that,
did I? You all did.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.269
You were all there but--

17:51.271 --> 17:53.471
[sigh]

17:53.473 --> 17:57.241
I wasn't there. I missed out.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.144
And seeing you having all
these jokes I wasn't a part of

18:00.146 --> 18:01.646
and couldn't
understand made me...

18:01.648 --> 18:06.851
No. The Princess of
Friendship can't get jealous.

18:06.853 --> 18:11.522
Sure you can, Twilight. And
none of us begrudge you for it.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.826
We're sorry if we made
you feel left out.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.828
You didn't do anything wrong.

18:16.830 --> 18:20.264
You're allowed to share
things that don't include me.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.134
And you're allowed to feel
a little jealous about it.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.736
You just have to be able to
admit that's what you're feeling

18:25.738 --> 18:27.605
so you can let it go.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.408
And, you know, not try to
make us recreate everything

18:30.410 --> 18:32.777
that happened when
you weren't around.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.779
Of course, none of this
would have happened

18:34.781 --> 18:39.884
if I hadn't encouraged everypony
not to invite you this weekend.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.386
They wanted me to be there?

18:42.388 --> 18:45.223
And you convinced
them to not invite me?

18:45.225 --> 18:47.558
Well, I didn't think that
they should interrupt you.

18:47.560 --> 18:53.764
But now I see that we should
have. Oh, I feel just terrible.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.869
You don't look like
you feel terrible.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.172
Better?

19:01.174 --> 19:02.707
Applejack: Wait a minute.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.775
You didn't suggest
not inviting Twilight

19:04.777 --> 19:08.279
cause you wanted to make
her feel left out, did you?

19:08.281 --> 19:12.517
That whole jealousy thing
was just a happy accident.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.420
Certainly we can all agree
that Princess Twilight

19:16.422 --> 19:18.556
learned a valuable lesson here.

19:18.558 --> 19:22.160
That even she can have
feelings of jealousy.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.228
That she should
recognize said feelings

19:24.230 --> 19:28.399
rather than try to pretend
that she doesn't have them?

19:28.401 --> 19:31.402
Did I get the tiniest bit
of glee out of watching her

19:31.404 --> 19:35.540
try to recreate our weekend of
fun in the name of "science"?

19:35.542 --> 19:39.310
Oh, most definitely.

19:39.312 --> 19:43.281
But what's important here is
that it was never my intent

19:43.283 --> 19:44.815
to make Twilight feel jealous.

19:44.817 --> 19:48.452
That's something the old
me would have tried to do.

19:50.556 --> 19:53.324
Orange you glad I've changed?

19:58.430 --> 20:02.533
I said "Orange you
glad I've changed?"

20:02.535 --> 20:04.835
[clattering]

20:04.837 --> 20:06.337
[cough]

20:06.339 --> 20:09.840
Orange! Like the ones
at the Applejack farm.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.442
From this weekend.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.247
No? Nothing? Really?

20:16.249 --> 20:19.383
I thought you'd find
this hisss-sterical.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.852
[rattle]

20:21.854 --> 20:26.691
Yes, no. Discord, I think these
jokes have run their course.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.526
Only way we'd find
them funny now is

20:28.528 --> 20:31.295
if you put us all under
some kind of spell.

20:31.297 --> 20:34.232
Come on! You'd have to
be a complete crazy pony

20:34.234 --> 20:36.000
to think he'd do
something like that.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.868
What are you going
to say next, Pinkie?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.738
That we'd all have to drink some
weird potion to break the spell?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.507
[laughter]

20:43.509 --> 20:45.743
What's so funny?

20:45.745 --> 20:50.615
Come on, Discord, do we really
have to spell it out for you?

20:50.617 --> 20:56.420
[laughter]

20:56.422 --> 20:57.788
I don't get it.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.859
Somepony want to tell me
what's so hilarious? Anypony?

21:01.861 --> 21:08.466
Hello? I'm talking to
you! You and you, you!

21:08.468 --> 21:11.035
Well, what's funny about spells?

21:11.037 --> 21:16.474
I don't get it; I feel left out
and I feel really bad about it.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.377
Sorry, buddy. Guess
you had to be there.

21:20.712 --> 21:21.812
[POOF]

21:24.750 --> 21:27.918
[laughter]
