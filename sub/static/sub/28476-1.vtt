What the fuck? What the fuck?

00:26.327 --> 00:28.260
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
what the fuck you doing?

00:28.262 --> 00:31.330
Sorry, I thought
you were garbage.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.257
- What the fuck, Kev?
- You're late.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.159
You wanna tell me
why I just woke up

01:00.161 --> 01:01.794
with all my shit in the street
and my key missing?

01:01.796 --> 01:03.829
Sure, it's because
you don't pay rent

01:03.831 --> 01:06.565
and I'm sick of finding you
drunk and passed out on my floor.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.634
- I work to pay off that rent.
- I'm sorry, you what?

01:08.636 --> 01:11.103
- I unclog the shitter.
- I unclog the shitter.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.672
- I fixed this loose door thing over here.
- Oh, yeah. This door?

01:13.674 --> 01:16.275
I sweep, I clean--

01:16.277 --> 01:19.511
No, no, you pretend to sweep
while you steal my fucking booze!

01:19.513 --> 01:22.181
I what?
I've never stolen...

01:22.183 --> 01:23.782
Prove it,
prove that I steal your booze.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.151
- All right, yeah.
- I don't steal.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.165
No, not on fire.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.667
You know why because
you drank my booze

01:41.669 --> 01:43.802
and you replaced it
with water.

01:45.473 --> 01:48.640
I'm your fucking brother,
man.

01:48.642 --> 01:53.312
No. No, you're a thief,
and a liar, and a drunk,

01:53.314 --> 01:56.315
and a fucking embarrassment,
Owen.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.452
Still.

02:00.454 --> 02:04.356
You can drag your mattress into
the boiler room and live there.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.725
I can what?
I can drag, into the...

02:06.727 --> 02:08.759
Ooh, I am a human.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.696
You can't just banish me

02:10.698 --> 02:13.198
like I'm some hunchy-back
franken monster,

02:13.200 --> 02:15.200
throw him into the bell tower,
wrap him in chains

02:15.202 --> 02:17.769
and drop him to the bottom
of the, of the, the, the...

02:17.771 --> 02:19.571
I'm not dungeon garbage!

02:19.573 --> 02:22.441
You know, if the government
of humane whatever

02:22.443 --> 02:27.179
came by here and I was a dog,
they would arrest you.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.815
You got a better offer,
take it.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.284
What if I just jumped over there and
took my key back, how about that?

02:32.286 --> 02:33.719
- How about that?
- Bet it's in your pocket right now.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.420
It is, it's right here
in my pocket.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.889
OK, well I could
just jump over this bar

02:36.891 --> 02:39.358
give you a little side to side,
put you in one of these guys,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.426
I could go out, get my stuff,
with my key,

02:41.428 --> 02:45.531
go back up and put my stuff
in your apartment with the key.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.899
Yep, totally possible.

02:46.901 --> 02:49.801
- Yeah, it's totally possible.
- Mm-hmm.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.267
Oh, shit.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.706
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.875
Hey, you all right?
Are you all right?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.543
Hey, do you know who this is?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.351
Oh, come on.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.455
Five bucks.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.392
'Cause why should I
get a break?

04:19.526 --> 04:22.361
Paulie! Oh, fuck me.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.695
Paulie!

04:25.833 --> 04:28.667
Oh, goddammit.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.937
Paulie, one of your hookers
has OD'd in my bathroom again.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.705
Well, call 911.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.807
I'm not paying
for another ambulance,

04:35.809 --> 04:37.776
get someone to drive her.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.478
No...

04:39.480 --> 04:40.912
Fuck.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.428
- Name?
- Prime Minister Chuto.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.930
- OK, we're done here.
- Where the fuck are my things?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.732
Oh, you mean your
vomit soaked dress?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.634
- We threw it out.
- What about my underwear?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.369
You weren't wearing any.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.638
What the fuck am I
supposed to wear home?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.842
Let a smile be your umbrella.

05:45.079 --> 05:48.714
Fucking umbrella!

05:48.716 --> 05:51.450
Oh, yeah, I bet you it fucking
turns you on doesn't it?

05:51.452 --> 05:53.585
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
You wanna fuck this?

05:53.587 --> 05:55.120
You wanna fuck...

06:03.997 --> 06:06.465
<i>♪ Stanky pussy ♪</i>

06:15.476 --> 06:17.776
<i>♪ Lay it on me, mama ♪</i>

06:20.114 --> 06:24.082
<i>♪ Pussy stank
but so do marijuana ♪</i>

06:24.084 --> 06:26.852
You're fired.

06:26.854 --> 06:30.455
- What?!
- Yeah, you're unmanageable.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.424
I mean, I can't deal
with it anymore.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.026
If you're not fucking up then
you're fucked up on pills or--

06:35.028 --> 06:36.628
You give me those pills.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.764
Some pills,
it's called moderation.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.532
All right, see this is
what I'm talking about.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.502
I let you squat at my place,
I give you my meds

06:43.504 --> 06:45.804
and what do I get in return?
Nothing but disrespect.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.674
- Come on, Cerebral--
- See, right there, that's what I'm talking about.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.844
This whole cerebral shit.
That's disrespectful to my face.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.946
Cerebral Paulie
is an endearing name.

06:54.948 --> 06:58.150
No, no, calling me Cerebral
Paulie is not endearing.

06:58.152 --> 07:01.420
I... I was the victim
of a drunk driving accident.

07:01.422 --> 07:05.524
- You were the drunk driver.
- Still a victim.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.726
- Paulie.
- Paul.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.529
- I'll make it up to you.
- Well, how you gonna do that?

07:10.531 --> 07:14.699
'Cause you and your pussy
are worthless.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.835
Yeah, my Blockbuster
membership card

07:16.837 --> 07:18.670
is worth more than
your pussy.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.006
Negroni.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.777
Come on.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.146
You're firing me
and keeping her.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.815
Chablis, yeah.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.684
'Cause she doesn't
vomit all over me.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.186
- Well--
- As much.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.954
Fucking help me.

07:38.058 --> 07:38.924
Fuck!

07:44.198 --> 07:45.931
Oh, fuck.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.601
Goddammit it.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.581
- What?
- Um, no, nothing I--

08:02.583 --> 08:04.049
What the fuck, man?

08:04.051 --> 08:05.851
- Hey, hey I'm--
- What the fuck do you want?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.752
You need money, right?

08:07.754 --> 08:12.123
I have some money
if you... if you need it.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.593
Really?

08:15.529 --> 08:16.895
That is like the sweetest--

08:16.897 --> 08:18.864
I was thinking, like,
a hand job.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.740
Yeah...

08:30.143 --> 08:31.643
Hmm.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.980
The fuck is with your hand?

08:34.982 --> 08:37.048
- What do you mean?
- Why... Why's it so rough?

08:37.049 --> 08:38.517
It's like burlap.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.018
I fell in some gravel
a while back,

08:40.020 --> 08:41.219
it got cut to shit.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.988
Are you bleeding?

08:42.990 --> 08:46.258
Relax, man.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.226
You're not gonna get
AIDS from my hand.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.663
Oh, phew. Now I feel so much better.
Thanks, Dr. Hooker.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.232
OK, your dick isn't
going inside me stupid.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.801
How do you think you're gonna get
AIDS, from a scab on my hand?

08:56.803 --> 08:59.571
Well, maybe from
the cut on my dick.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.173
Yeah, I tripped down some steps
last week, caught it on a nail.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.809
Now, who's a stupid?

09:04.811 --> 09:07.612
Well, I don't have AIDS.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.182
I don't have AIDS either.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.555
- Let me use my other hand.
- Yeah, you should do that.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.093
OK.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.163
Yeah,
you like that better?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.232
No.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.668
Yeah, I fucking passed out
on my hand last night,

09:29.670 --> 09:31.102
it fucking kills.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.009
OK...

09:39.613 --> 09:42.147
OK. Go back to the other one.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.721
OK.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.296
- You wanna play with my balls?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, you want that?

09:58.298 --> 09:59.798
OK, maybe,
don't do that for a bit.

09:59.800 --> 10:05.236
OK. OK, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Oh.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.273
OK, you know what?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.845
Whoo, yeah, that's...
OK, we're done.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.681
- Really, you're done?
- Oh, yeah, are you kidding?

10:16.683 --> 10:18.650
You just stroked a dick,
balls lifted up,

10:18.652 --> 10:22.754
carried the jizz right out
the dickie hole, A-plus.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.024
Are you faking?

10:26.026 --> 10:28.360
No, I'm not... I'm not...
no, no, no, I'm--

10:28.362 --> 10:30.695
- Nope.
- Hey, 'cause where is, hm?

10:30.697 --> 10:32.030
Where... where's the guck?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.798
Yeah, I'm telling you,
what happened,

10:33.800 --> 10:36.334
it was so hot
that it just like...

10:36.336 --> 10:39.170
- it turned into air.
- You're fucking faking!

10:39.172 --> 10:40.972
You're such a fucking sissy!

10:40.974 --> 10:43.408
Yeah, you know what, I am
faking, because you're the worst

10:43.410 --> 10:45.810
five-dollar hand job whore
five dollars ever bought.

10:45.812 --> 10:49.014
That is why your pimp fired you
'cause you're bad at your job.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.815
All right,
then five fuck you.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.218
Just give me my fucking,
fucking five dollars and fuck off.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.719
What five bucks?

10:56.323 --> 10:59.124
What are you gonna do,
hooker without a pimp?

10:59.126 --> 11:01.092
Frontier justice bitch.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.265
I have your
money, I have your money,

11:07.267 --> 11:09.768
I have your money, I have your
money, I have your money.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.974
- I don't have your money.
- What?!

11:15.976 --> 11:17.842
Listen, this is why you need
to get the money upfront,

11:17.844 --> 11:19.277
don't you know anything?
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.146
Wait, wait you need
a place to stay, right?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.782
I might know a place.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.928
So...
So, where you from?

11:36.930 --> 11:39.330
- Really?
- Well, I don't know, fuck.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.734
I can't sleep, tell me a
story, lie to me, something.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.136
OK. Once upon a time,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.005
there was an asshole douchebag
named Fuckface.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.874
- OK, fuck you.
- Oh, no, fuck you.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.248
Brockville.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.351
- What?
- I am from Brockville.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.353
- So, I'm from here.
- So, you wanted me to tell you something,

12:02.355 --> 12:04.089
- I'm telling you something.
- I meant something good,

12:04.091 --> 12:05.390
- not something stupid.
- You asked me, you fuck face.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.026
- You fuck face, you.
- Oh, fuck you.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.366
So, how long
you been a whore?

12:16.970 --> 12:19.037
About nine years,
ever since I moved to the city.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.039
- How's that going for you?
- Yeah, says the guy

12:21.041 --> 12:22.440
who's sleeping in
the Freddy Kreuger room.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.475
- You should quit.
- Oh, that's sweet.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.909
Being that you're the worst.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.211
Yeah, you're the worst
John I ever had.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.479
You're like a little
fucking baby.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.013
Ow, my penis, my little,
little penis.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.849
Nine years, you'd be way better
at hand jobs by now.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.784
- OK, dick scab.
- Three months... If you said three months to me,

12:32.786 --> 12:34.319
I'd be like,
"Oh, yeah, three months.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.520
- OK.
- That's a three month hand job tops.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.455
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

12:44.464 --> 12:46.064
Oh, what the...

12:46.066 --> 12:48.500
You smoked all my cigarettes?

12:48.502 --> 12:50.769
Oh, you mean the butts
that you found outside

12:50.771 --> 12:52.137
and put into a can?

12:52.139 --> 12:54.205
Gee, if only there was a way
we could find more.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.907
Jesus fuck!

12:55.909 --> 12:58.243
Quit whining and do something!

13:10.490 --> 13:12.290
Do you have family
in Brockville or...?

13:12.292 --> 13:13.892
Yeah, just a grandma.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.294
She has this big house
outside the city.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.229
What like a house-house?

13:18.231 --> 13:21.199
No, like a,
like a fucking doll house.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.369
Yes, a house-house,
it has a yard,

13:24.371 --> 13:26.471
two floors,
it's all moldy and rotting.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.473
They're probably gonna tear it
down, put her into a home,

13:28.475 --> 13:30.842
she's this crazy
hoarding cat lady.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.111
You...
you have no other family?

13:34.815 --> 13:37.415
No, my family
was burned alive--

13:37.417 --> 13:39.117
I'll fucking fix up
that house.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.888
- You can't fix shit.
- I can, too, I'm handy.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.024
I did this whole bar.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.559
Did what?
Hit it with a hammer?

13:47.561 --> 13:49.327
Look, I can fix up
your cat lady house

13:49.329 --> 13:51.196
and make it look livable.
What can you do?

13:51.198 --> 13:52.597
Uh, things that are
actually true in real life.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.933
Let me paint you
a picture, OK.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.569
This city sucks and it blows
and it's holding us up,

13:57.571 --> 14:00.171
and it's punching us
in the face like this.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.475
- And?
- And, it's turning you

14:04.477 --> 14:06.177
into a shitty junkie hooker
who sucks,

14:06.179 --> 14:09.314
and me into, you know,
like, a cool guy,

14:09.316 --> 14:11.115
who's hit a bit
of a rough patch.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.483
A drunk, do nothing,
shit for brains

14:12.485 --> 14:14.152
- who lives in a monster cave?
- My point is

14:14.154 --> 14:16.387
that we can
get the fuck of here.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.122
We can go Brockville,
I can fix up your house

14:18.124 --> 14:20.592
and we can live in it.
New start.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.563
I'm not living with you.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.266
I can barely stand
looking at you.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.934
You said two floors, right?

14:37.878 --> 14:39.110
Lacie.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.913
Owen.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.017
Your plan's
pretty stupid, Owen.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.919
- Your face is pretty stupid.
- Eat a dick.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.154
- Eat a dick.
- You eat a dick, you.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.026
So, how we getting there?

15:04.204 --> 15:07.438
<i>♪ I met you at the door ♪</i>

15:07.440 --> 15:09.107
Forty-nine bucks.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.975
OK. OK, that's not so bad.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.912
- Each.
- Fuck. Fuck.

15:13.914 --> 15:14.913
That's like 90 bucks.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.247
- Ninety-eight.
- Nerd.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.684
- OK, dick.
- OK, OK, 98 bucks.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.619
We can do that,
that's doable.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.155
Can do, can be done.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.435
You look like
a serial killer.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.937
You look like
a mental patient.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.204
You spelt Brockville wrong.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.940
Yeah, on purpose,
it's a joke,

15:41.942 --> 15:43.441
it's a hilarious word joke.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.076
It's stupid
and you're stupid

15:45.078 --> 15:46.444
and everyone thinks
you're retarded.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.079
Well, everyone thinks
you are a crazy whore,

15:48.081 --> 15:50.281
because you're a crazy whore.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.091
We are going
to do this my way.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.994
I'm in charge, you are the drunk
do nothing fuck up.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.263
I am the hustler,
we're doing this my way.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.132
What is your way? We're gonna fuck
the cars into stopping for us?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.467
No.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.303
No.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.205
You know that thing, Christians,
they wanna help the needy.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.008
- Yeah.
- We gotta take advantage of that.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.409
We gotta look more needy.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.445
What is more needy
that no pants?

16:20.447 --> 16:23.348
Injured, no pants.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.119
Help me, my leg!
I need to get to a hospital!

16:28.121 --> 16:30.288
- In Brockville.
- In Brockville.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.156
Help this crazy whore
who hurt her leg

16:32.158 --> 16:34.292
and needs to get to
a hospital in Brockville.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.260
Oh, fuck, dude,
say I'm your wife or something.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.296
Oh, come... that's...
We're going for believable.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.065
Well, don't say whore.
People don't stop for whores.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.267
People stop for whores all the
time, that's the whole busi...

16:43.269 --> 16:45.703
Oh, my God, you've never
fucked a John who had a car.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.275
Shut up, do your job.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.344
Help... Hey, hey!

16:53.346 --> 16:55.279
My disgusting aunty
broke her leg.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.249
- Oh, fuck you.
- Just stay in character.

16:58.251 --> 17:02.320
Hey, help!
She's so gross, help!

17:02.322 --> 17:03.488
You know what,
just be a man.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.256
Get out there
and stop that car!

17:05.258 --> 17:07.157
- OK, I'll do it, OK.
- Make 'em stop.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.694
OK, OK, OK.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.767
Motherfucker,
not cool, man!

17:18.505 --> 17:21.439
OK, now you go.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.741
- What, like, in the road?
- Yeah, in the road.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.510
Fuck that,
I'll get hit by a car.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.678
No, no, no,
they're gonna stop for you now

17:27.680 --> 17:30.348
- because I'm actually injured.
- So what?

17:30.350 --> 17:32.250
Are you saying
that I'm a shitty actor?

17:32.252 --> 17:35.420
OK, yeah, Brando,
show me what you got?

17:40.193 --> 17:43.461
Subtle, I'm playing it
very subtle.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.762
Hey, hey, hey!

17:44.764 --> 17:47.265
This ugly hobo
got hit by a car.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.133
He got hit by a car.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.468
Ha!

17:51.805 --> 17:53.171
Are you all right miss?

17:53.173 --> 17:55.073
Yeah, yeah.
Where you headed?

17:55.075 --> 17:57.208
- Agua Valley.
- Are you going through Brockville?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.777
- Can do.
- Perfect.

18:07.387 --> 18:11.722
<i>♪ Told you I heard you
cry those animals ♪</i>

18:11.724 --> 18:14.692
<i>♪ Back in your eye lids ♪</i>

18:16.429 --> 18:18.396
Well, that didn't work.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.498
Oh, look what the world
barfed back up!

18:20.500 --> 18:24.435
- Motherfucker tried to rob me. I showed him.
- What you beat him up?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.704
- No, I just didn't have anything.
- Oh, you did show him.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.474
Then, guy throws me
out of the car to the gravel,

18:29.476 --> 18:31.609
again with the fucking gravel.
Look at my face,

18:31.611 --> 18:34.412
it's all fucking chafed.
Yeah, and then I go back

18:34.414 --> 18:36.314
to where I left you
and guess what? You're gone.

18:36.316 --> 18:41.185
Vamoosh. I had to walk all the
way back here by myself, asshole.

18:41.187 --> 18:45.323
First of all, you left me,
you backwards country dick.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.226
Secondly, it's vamoose,
not vamoosh.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.627
Vamoosh is not a thing.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.363
Thirdly, I'm glad
your skin is chafey,

18:52.365 --> 18:54.432
now you know
how my dick feels.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.701
It looks like you gave
a hand job to your own face.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.737
What the fuck? Can we just, um,
slow down for a minute here.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.440
Um...

19:05.245 --> 19:07.245
What the fuck, guys?

19:07.247 --> 19:08.813
My grandma's got a crazy,
cat lady house in Brockville.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.615
Yeah, I'm gonna fix it up,
we're both gonna live there.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.316
- I call top floor.
- We're gonna get the fuck out

19:12.318 --> 19:14.385
- of this fucking city for good.
- Fuck out of this, yes.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.221
- Fucking new start.
- But, somebody, I don't wanna say who,

19:17.223 --> 19:19.190
but she smells
like vomit and radishes,

19:19.192 --> 19:21.392
- bailed and fucked up the plan.
- I didn't fuck up shit.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.161
You're the fuck up.
I make shit happen.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.663
- You made me get hit by a car.
- You made you get hit by a car.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.698
So, now we need
98 bucks for bus fare.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.234
- Yeah, can we borrow 98 bucks?
- Ah, don't sit there.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.703
- Why, what's wrong?
- You're not wearing pants.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.873
Oh, you noticed.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.708
OK,
can I just say something?

19:37.710 --> 19:40.511
Um,
you will never have $98.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.581
If you magically
managed to make two dollars,

19:43.583 --> 19:45.249
you would immediately
drink it away

19:45.251 --> 19:47.185
and be left with zero dollars.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.753
What kind of drink
can you buy with two dollars.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.422
Grain, Ides, T-Bird,
Night Train, Ripple,

19:51.424 --> 19:53.891
Two Buck Chuck. Ooh,
yeah I'd probably get that Two Buck Chuck.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.495
But the most fucked up part of
your whole stupid fucking plan,

19:57.497 --> 20:01.199
is in order for it to work, you would
actually have to help somebody else.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.801
Be part of team.
Be relied on for shit.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.904
And that,
that's science fiction.

20:06.906 --> 20:10.775
In fact, I am so sure this isn't
gonna happen, I'll you what.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.212
For every dollar you two
mamo's make, I'll match it.

20:14.214 --> 20:18.349
What? Oh, that is a deal.
That is a deal.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.984
Gentleman's agreement
that I want in writing.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.652
Sorry,
what's this bullshit?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.321
Now, we only have to make
half as much.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.922
What? That makes it,
like, twice as easy.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.924
Hey, Rummy,
you heard this right?

20:26.926 --> 20:31.862
Yeah, Kevin's gonna build a house
for all the cats to live in.

20:31.864 --> 20:35.299
- Witness.
- Hmm, yeah.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.867
Oh, I'm gonna make you
regret that napkin.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.270
I'm gonna make you
fuck that napkin.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.272
- Prepare to get fucked, buddy.
- OK, I will prepare for that.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.374
You do that 'cause
we're gonna fuck you.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.543
Yeah, we're gonna fuck you right
where you live, right in your bar.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.923
Maybe...

21:00.560 --> 21:01.892
Bicycle!

21:04.530 --> 21:06.731
You're just saying things you
see, I can do that, too.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.533
Fire hydrant. Muffler.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.435
Awesome.

21:15.008 --> 21:16.974
Yeah, this is a flimsy one.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.343
OK. OK, you stay
on lookout, all right?

21:19.345 --> 21:21.345
Mm-hmm.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.613
Excuse me!

21:22.615 --> 21:24.382
- Person.
- Excuse me.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.850
I don't even know
what you're talking about, so...

21:25.852 --> 21:26.984
Are you trying
to steal a bike?

21:26.986 --> 21:28.686
Ah, I'm out for
a Sunday stroll.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.955
- It's Tuesday.
- Nerd.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.590
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna have to

21:32.592 --> 21:33.991
ask you and your girlfriend
to leave.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.526
I am not his girlfriend.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.528
Whatever, you're trespassing.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.929
How do you know
that we're not students here?

21:38.931 --> 21:41.565
- Are you students?
- Yes.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.567
What are you studying?

21:43.569 --> 21:45.569
- School finance repair.
- Art.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.805
So, what's with the hack saw?

21:47.807 --> 21:50.574
I'm fixing my deck.

21:50.576 --> 21:54.412
- You have a deck?
- I don't care for your tone.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.746
Yes, I have a deck.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.516
It is attached to my
house on the beach,

21:58.518 --> 22:02.053
which is where we were
strolling to, to the beach.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.587
You live in The Beeches

22:03.589 --> 22:05.323
and you're gonna
walk there from here?

22:05.325 --> 22:06.791
The beach, actually.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.392
That's what you call it
when you live there.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.328
You call it the beach,
that's how I know

22:10.330 --> 22:11.896
you're not from there 'cause you
just called it The Beeches,

22:11.898 --> 22:13.798
so, you wouldn't know,

22:13.800 --> 22:16.667
you wouldn't know
where my deck is at.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.509
Is she supposed to go in there?

22:27.680 --> 22:31.082
- I gave you the cue.
- You ran away!

22:31.084 --> 22:32.616
That was the cue!

22:32.618 --> 22:35.720
- Running away was the cue?
- Person.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.954
You are the worst
at everything.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.023
How's that bike lock coming?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.359
It's coming.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.527
- Person.
- Ah, fuck this bike lock!

22:43.529 --> 22:45.763
Goddammit, it's like black
kryptonite, it's impossible.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.565
Well, maybe if you
didn't have booze muscles.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.999
They should make the
whole bike out of this stuff

22:49.001 --> 22:51.736
and then that way bike theft
would cease to exist.

22:53.506 --> 22:54.638
You'd still have
to lock the bike.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.374
I know,
I knew it when I said it

22:56.376 --> 22:58.776
that it was stupid...
I'm just saying, you know,

22:58.778 --> 23:00.978
it'd be easier for me to
actually saw through the bike

23:00.980 --> 23:03.914
than it would be for me
to saw through the, the...

23:06.953 --> 23:08.586
Forty-nine bucks.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.522
First of all, you stole this.

23:11.524 --> 23:12.923
Forty-eight bucks.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.892
Second of all, it's useless.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.894
This shit is ten-speed man.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.864
Six bucks.

23:19.866 --> 23:23.434
Was a 10 speed, now it's just a
bunch of metal and rubber.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.802
Oh, what, come on.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.704
No, look, this,
there's still, like,

23:26.706 --> 23:27.872
six, seven speeds in here.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.473
Forty-nine bucks and a hand job.

23:29.475 --> 23:31.709
I'll give you a hand job,
let's go.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.645
Please leave my store.

23:42.155 --> 23:44.155
Hey, Kev,
can I have a drink, man?

23:44.157 --> 23:46.190
- It's been a long day.
- Sure, five bucks.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.659
Come on,
just one whiskey sour.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.594
One, one, one whiskey sour.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.130
Just one... just one...
Just a rum and coke, rum and coke.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.133
Just give me one of whatever
no one drinks around here.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.869
Just give me the Tia Maria
and the vermouth

23:58.871 --> 24:01.439
with a melon liqueur, rocks.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.741
Do you have any Tylenol...
threes?

24:03.743 --> 24:08.479
You know what I did today, while you
two chuckle heads were out being stupid?

24:08.481 --> 24:09.647
I was here.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.582
Like I always am.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.150
That was my day.

24:13.152 --> 24:17.188
I don't get to run around having
stinky fucking adventures.

24:17.190 --> 24:19.089
I can't even sit around
playing guitar.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.925
Whoa, whoa, play guitar?

24:20.927 --> 24:22.526
I can't even go to the movies.

24:22.528 --> 24:25.129
I can't have a fucking
second to live

24:25.131 --> 24:31.101
because my brother is a selfish,
do nothing, piece of shit.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.803
You don't even know
how to play guitar.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.607
Wow, exactly, Owen, exactly.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.809
You don't even own a guitar.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.147
Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey.
What you doing with that?

24:43.149 --> 24:45.683
- That's mine.
- This is garbage.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.885
No, no, no.
I've got plans for that.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.587
I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna do stuff with it.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.588
You have plans for this?

24:50.590 --> 24:52.957
- Big plans.
- Big plans.

25:02.768 --> 25:04.001
Fuck it!

25:05.738 --> 25:09.073
Oh, hey, look,
I got a tip, whoo!

25:10.076 --> 25:11.675
What's with cranky?

25:11.677 --> 25:12.877
I don't know,
he's mad 'cause he sucks

25:12.879 --> 25:14.812
at playing guitar
or something?

25:14.814 --> 25:16.747
It's this fucking city.
I'm telling you, it drives you crazy.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.249
I know,
we gotta get out of here.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.251
Look, we gotta brainstorm.

25:20.253 --> 25:22.186
You know what that is?
You know about brainstorming?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.821
It's when I say something,
it gives you an idea

25:23.823 --> 25:26.557
and then you say something back
to me that gives me an idea,

25:26.558 --> 25:29.292
and I give something to you, and then we just
go back and forth and back and forth like that

25:29.295 --> 25:30.661
until we have
a perfect master plan, OK?

25:30.663 --> 25:32.930
I'm gonna start.

25:32.932 --> 25:33.998
Dog-napping.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.700
Dumbass. No wait, prison.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.837
OK. Look, well,
you think of something then.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.139
You're a hooker, I thought you
guys were supposed to be crafty.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.141
Why don't I just fuck a guy
and charge him 49 bucks?

25:44.143 --> 25:46.076
- I'm taking these.
- Uh, no.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.746
Look, if we learned anything
it's that no grown man

25:48.748 --> 25:50.814
wants to do anything
to any part of you.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.151
No grown man.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.886
No, you can't do that,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.588
you can't just say
what I say back at me,

25:57.590 --> 25:59.890
that's not,
that's shitty brainstorming.

26:03.129 --> 26:07.298
Who needs to have sex
worse than anyone else?

26:09.802 --> 26:12.036
Panda's.

26:12.038 --> 26:15.005
Yeah, I'm gonna fuck a panda,
that's my plan.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.008
Come on, genius, let's go.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.710
You can brainstorm on the way.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.178
Stitching...

26:21.180 --> 26:22.346
Hey, dorks.

26:22.348 --> 26:25.049
What you doing, playing cards?

26:25.051 --> 26:29.720
Um, yeah, Mystic cards.
This is Lady Saint Martha--

26:29.722 --> 26:33.157
Cool, so you know how your dicks have
never touched a real live woman before?

26:33.159 --> 26:35.159
Tucking your boners into
your waistbands and what not?

26:35.161 --> 26:37.094
Well, Lacie here is
a real live street whore.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.264
Yeah, I touch sad little dicks
like yours for a living.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.734
Oh, I like the sound
of this pause.

26:43.736 --> 26:44.868
Let's talk numbers.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.272
Wait, just start
from the beginning.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.207
Twenty. Ten.
- That's 30.

26:50.209 --> 26:53.043
Thirty-five, 40, 45, 46.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.713
Forty-nine.
Forty-nine bucks!

26:55.715 --> 26:59.183
Dicks out, dweebs,
let's get you all in a row.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.318
I'll leave it to you
to decide who gets to go first.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.821
I don't know thumb war,
rock-scissors-paper.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.623
Yeah, we wanna go
at the same time.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.791
I hate to break it to you boys,
I only got two paws.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.094
Yeah, don't look at me fellas.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.730
Yeah, no,
we want a gang bang.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.098
- I'm sorry.
- What?

27:14.100 --> 27:15.265
With the both of you.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.167
- I'm sorry?
- What?

27:17.169 --> 27:19.069
I told you we'd be
needing these someday.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.938
- Yes.
- Are you guys shaved?

27:20.940 --> 27:23.173
- I prefer shaved.
- Can I have mouths?

27:23.175 --> 27:24.975
I want her
to look like she's 12.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.777
- Eh.
- Jesus.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.647
- What? I'm only 13.
- Are condoms compulsory?

27:29.649 --> 27:31.215
Are you guys
cool with blindfolds?

27:31.217 --> 27:34.952
Not for the whole time.
I like eye contact.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.921
What if I'm just doing mouths?

27:37.923 --> 27:40.758
Ah, OK, I can offer you
like a crick of my elbow.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.926
- I think that we're straying from the original plan.
- One of these guys...

27:42.928 --> 27:44.261
She's winterized right?

27:44.263 --> 27:45.696
We walk right now
if she's not winterized.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.231
I'll pay you 20 more bucks

27:47.233 --> 27:48.666
if you take a Bluto pie.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.436
What the fuck
is a Bluto pie?

27:52.438 --> 27:55.305
What the fuck is winterized?

27:58.678 --> 28:00.277
What is that? What is that?

28:00.279 --> 28:02.713
It's a musical chair.

28:02.715 --> 28:04.448
Like, musical chairs?

28:05.785 --> 28:07.751
No, musical chair.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.687
One of you lies
face down on the ground

28:09.689 --> 28:11.422
and the four of us
walk around you.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.424
- When the music stops.
- Can I talk to you for a second?

28:13.426 --> 28:15.359
- Just a second kids.
- Wait.

28:19.298 --> 28:23.367
Listen, I apologize
for my friends.

28:23.369 --> 28:26.136
I know it's probably
against the rules,

28:26.138 --> 28:27.938
but would it be
terribly untoward

28:27.940 --> 28:30.474
if I kissed you
on the mouth?

28:32.044 --> 28:34.378
What the hell?
Is she backing out?

28:35.781 --> 28:37.281
No, no, I think she's...

28:37.283 --> 28:39.750
She's just, um, she's getting
limber before the...

28:39.752 --> 28:40.918
You guys take gym class,
right?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.287
We had a deal.

28:43.289 --> 28:46.023
Yeah, no, we still,
I'm gonna, um...

28:46.025 --> 28:48.759
I'm gonna get you a few of
those wizard cards you like,

28:48.761 --> 28:51.061
or I'm gonna hook you guys
up with those.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.796
You guys wanna learn
how to smoke some cigarettes?

28:52.798 --> 28:56.133
OK, hey, hey...

28:59.972 --> 29:02.005
You know what
your problem is?

29:02.007 --> 29:03.974
I got a dick on my face?

29:03.976 --> 29:08.045
- Oh, wait.
- This, this is the problem.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.080
See, that's why those kids
disrespected you

29:10.082 --> 29:13.784
because they can see you.
They see... they see this.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.220
But if we could find a way

29:16.222 --> 29:18.889
for you to touch
the dicks of the people

29:18.891 --> 29:23.260
without the people seeing you,
seeing this, then I think...

29:23.262 --> 29:27.531
Oh, yeah, I think then
we'd really have something.

29:27.533 --> 29:31.068
<i>♪ We eat at all
the finest places ♪</i>

29:38.844 --> 29:41.945
<i>♪ I met you at the door ♪</i>

29:41.947 --> 29:45.182
<i>♪ Of a record store ♪</i>

29:45.184 --> 29:48.352
<i>♪ I knew you'd be mine ♪</i>

29:48.354 --> 29:51.922
<i>♪ Because you look so fine ♪</i>

29:51.924 --> 29:55.025
<i>♪ I didn't think your love ♪</i>

29:55.027 --> 29:59.062
<i>♪ Could've hurt me so bad ♪</i>

30:00.032 --> 30:02.466
Rummy, my man, what is up?

30:02.468 --> 30:07.971
Hey, Owen, I'm just, I'm worried
that if I eat this...

30:07.973 --> 30:09.973
I might lose my foot.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.176
Let me ask you something,

30:12.178 --> 30:15.112
when was the last time
you were laid?

30:15.114 --> 30:18.849
You know, it's hard...

30:18.851 --> 30:22.219
to find the right girl.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.821
Oh, I know. I know, man.

30:23.823 --> 30:29.393
I have very particular,
particular tastes.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.128
Like what?

30:35.367 --> 30:37.267
- Jesus fuck.
- Will you relax?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.569
You're not gonna have
to see any of that,

30:38.571 --> 30:40.304
you're gonna be on
the other side of a door.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.839
You know, this could be
a glory hole situation

30:41.841 --> 30:43.006
for the both of you.

30:43.008 --> 30:43.941
Rummy's penis, it could be

30:43.943 --> 30:45.475
the penis of James Bond.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.077
Which reminds me,

30:47.079 --> 30:50.280
Rummy thinks you're a big,
fat black lady so...

30:51.951 --> 30:53.283
How does that sentence end?

30:53.285 --> 30:55.452
Just, you know...

30:55.454 --> 30:57.020
If he wants you to...
I don't know.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.589
I'm behind a door,
what do you want me to do?

30:58.591 --> 31:00.524
Just, if he would like you
to talk or something then--

31:00.526 --> 31:03.293
What? You want me
to sing a church hymn?

31:03.295 --> 31:04.895
No, that's racist.

31:04.897 --> 31:10.567
OK, just like, maybe don't
take any shit, or...

31:10.569 --> 31:13.303
- Don't make me do an impression.
- I won't.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.239
Anyway, he doesn't
wanna talk, OK.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.507
He wants to...
Jesus Christ, do you even know

31:17.509 --> 31:20.344
- how glory holes work?
- Yes, I know glory holes work.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.379
I'm the glory hole expert.
I built the glory hole.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.414
Oh, OK,
you cut a hole in a door.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.050
- It doesn't make you Bob Vila.
- There's a lot more to it.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.086
You've gotta put a duct thing in
and you've gotta sand it...

31:29.088 --> 31:30.221
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- ...with the measurements.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.355
Clearly,
you put your dick in a hole.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.556
I don't wanna talk about

31:32.558 --> 31:33.891
the intricacies
of carpentry with you.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.158
- Hey, Rummy!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.494
Here we go, man.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.129
You guys
are really getting along

31:39.131 --> 31:40.998
like a bag of shit on fire.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.234
Quite the duo,
a couple of Garfunkels.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.936
Hey, let me ask you something,

31:45.938 --> 31:50.274
what are you gonna do
when you fuck it all up?

31:50.276 --> 31:56.246
'Cause... mark that day on your
calendar, it's gonna happen.

31:56.248 --> 32:01.485
The sky's blue, water's wet,
Garfield hates Monday's

32:01.487 --> 32:05.022
and you fuck shit up.

32:05.024 --> 32:10.961
So, when that happens, is your
shiny new partner gonna man up

32:10.963 --> 32:13.230
or is he gonna pussy out?

32:14.466 --> 32:15.599
Hmm.

32:21.206 --> 32:25.976
Just so you know, we're here
for you if you ever need us.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.115
Huh, all right?

32:32.117 --> 32:35.185
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- There she is.

32:35.187 --> 32:38.689
- This takes me back.
- Hmm, back to what?

32:38.691 --> 32:43.193
First woman I was ever with
was a large, black woman.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.395
Well, that is what I got here.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.664
First woman I ever loved.

32:47.666 --> 32:54.037
I was 19 and she was...
68, 70, I don't know.

32:54.039 --> 32:57.975
Her skin was so
fucking loose.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.309
Mm, OK that's--

32:59.311 --> 33:01.111
I was on a school trip
to Buffalo,

33:01.113 --> 33:03.413
and I accidentally went

33:03.415 --> 33:05.282
into the wrong bathroom
at Dairy Queen and then--

33:05.284 --> 33:07.184
OK, OK.
You know, it's rude

33:07.186 --> 33:08.452
to keep a lady waiting,
Rummy, so...

33:08.454 --> 33:11.154
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.723
I'm nothing
if I'm not a gentleman.

33:12.725 --> 33:14.057
Mm-hmm.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.527
The money.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.498
Dost thou take me
for a rube, sir?

33:21.500 --> 33:24.568
After.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.348
I think your hole is broken.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.754
Lacie. Lacie!

33:43.756 --> 33:45.722
Did you bring me juice?

33:45.724 --> 33:47.657
Oh, what the fuck?
Did you take something?

33:47.659 --> 33:50.027
- Who gave you pills?
- Paulie!

33:50.029 --> 33:52.529
Paulie was in a pinch
and he couldn't open

33:52.531 --> 33:55.599
so, he took a cough wrench
and he left it in his shoulder

33:55.601 --> 33:59.169
and then he farted on his dick.
Farted on his dick.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.471
Paulie rhymes with Molly,
Molly rhymes with jolly,

34:01.473 --> 34:04.441
I'm not jolly,
just kidding, I'm so sad.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.310
Please, don't fucking do this.
We're so close, please, just two minutes,

34:07.312 --> 34:08.678
just wake up for two minutes.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.679
Wake up, wake.

34:10.681 --> 34:12.815
Oh, my God.
OK, OK, look...

34:12.818 --> 34:14.717
We're gonna,
we're gonna go on a trip.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.386
- Trip?
- We're gonna go on a little trip,

34:16.388 --> 34:18.588
- just a little trip, OK.
- Juice?

34:18.590 --> 34:20.389
Yeah, juice.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.726
OK, one, two, three.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.752
Hello?

34:51.356 --> 34:52.722
Hello?

34:54.726 --> 34:56.525
Anybody home?

35:02.801 --> 35:05.802
Do you want
the 20 bucks or not?

35:28.827 --> 35:30.861
I felt something.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.880
Hello?

35:58.290 --> 35:59.523
Ooh.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.794
Oh, yeah.

Hmm?

- And look sad, yeah.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.052
You just sit there, you look sad

52:26.711 --> 52:28.744
Are you just gonna
stand there and look stupid?

52:28.746 --> 52:30.746
Oh, yeah, you're you.

52:39.190 --> 52:40.489
So, where are you
two lovebirds heading?

52:40.491 --> 52:42.358
- No, no, we're not lovebirds.
- No!

52:42.360 --> 52:46.195
OK, I didn't mean to pry.
Where are you off to?

52:47.231 --> 52:50.633
Um... Brockville.

52:50.635 --> 52:52.301
Is that near Cabbage town?

52:52.303 --> 52:54.870
Uh, no it's not a street,
it's a town.

52:54.872 --> 52:56.739
It's on the way to Ottawa.

52:56.741 --> 52:59.842
Oh, I'm sorry,
I can't go past the GTA.

52:59.844 --> 53:02.845
So what now, Doctor Professor?

53:07.485 --> 53:11.620
- Give me your money asshole!
- What the fuck?

53:11.622 --> 53:12.855
Sir, that's not funny.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.456
No, no, yeah,
I'm not making jokes.

53:14.458 --> 53:15.591
- Give me your money.
- No, no, no.

53:15.593 --> 53:17.293
I... I am not with him.

53:17.295 --> 53:18.961
Can you please put
your curly knife away, sir?

53:18.963 --> 53:20.829
He's not gonna give you
any fucking money!

53:20.831 --> 53:22.398
Yes, he is gonna
give me his money.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.666
No, I'm not gonna
give you any money.

53:23.668 --> 53:24.867
Why do you think they have

53:24.869 --> 53:26.502
this plastic fucking wall here?

53:26.504 --> 53:28.404
I'm gonna stab
the fuck through it.

53:28.406 --> 53:30.206
Sir, you cannot stab
through the glass.

53:30.208 --> 53:31.974
You don't think
I'm gonna do it?

53:31.976 --> 53:33.776
- I just... you can't...
- You don't think I'm gonna do it?

53:33.778 --> 53:35.511
It's not a challenge, sir,
I'm not daring you.

53:35.513 --> 53:37.513
Just please do not stab
through the glass.

53:39.951 --> 53:43.252
- What the fuck?!
- Sir, sir, sir...

53:43.854 --> 53:45.521
What the fuck?!

53:53.931 --> 53:56.298
When did you guys
put plastic in here?

53:56.300 --> 53:58.367
It's new, actually, we just started
putting it into all the cars.

53:58.369 --> 54:01.237
- Of course you did.
- So where am I going, sir?

54:01.239 --> 54:04.506
I just want to get the fuck out
of this fucking city.

54:04.508 --> 54:05.908
I can't leave the GTA, sir.

54:05.910 --> 54:08.277
I know, I know
you can't, man.

54:08.279 --> 54:12.448
- Dude, how are you this dumb?
- I don't know.

54:15.553 --> 54:18.287
Just pull over anywhere, OK?

54:18.789 --> 54:20.723
Just pull...

54:20.725 --> 54:21.924
Here is good.

54:23.594 --> 54:25.894
Buddy... Pull over anywhere,
we'll just get,

54:25.896 --> 54:28.897
we'll get out of your hair.

54:32.003 --> 54:32.935
Beardy.

54:32.937 --> 54:34.703
Beardy man.

54:34.705 --> 54:36.905
Anywhere you wanna pull over,
OK?

54:36.907 --> 54:39.808
Oh, this is... great.

54:45.950 --> 54:47.716
Hey.

54:47.718 --> 54:49.885
That's $9.25, please.

54:50.554 --> 54:52.921
What?

54:52.923 --> 54:54.857
That's $9.25, please.

54:54.859 --> 54:58.394
Yeah, I don't know
how this was unclear.

54:58.396 --> 55:00.029
We don't have any money.

55:00.031 --> 55:03.432
Yeah, um, he just tried
to fucking rob you.

55:03.434 --> 55:05.634
Connect the dots, dude.

55:05.636 --> 55:11.407
Not paying is the same as
robbing, so it's $9.25 or prison.

55:13.944 --> 55:15.911
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, no, no, no.

55:15.913 --> 55:18.580
- Please, do not do this.
- Just let us out of the car.

55:18.582 --> 55:20.416
Just fucking let me
out of the car.

55:20.418 --> 55:22.418
I don't know him.
I'll give you a hand job.

55:22.420 --> 55:24.687
- You are clearly with him.
- No. No, not even a little bit.

55:24.689 --> 55:26.689
- You're clearly with him.
- Not even a little bit, I don't even know--

55:26.691 --> 55:28.824
Who you trying to kid?
You're clearly together.

55:28.825 --> 55:30.958
I will give you a fucking hand job,
man, just let me out of the car.

55:30.961 --> 55:33.062
I'm not interested in your
hand job, it's money or prison.

55:33.064 --> 55:34.997
We don't have any
fucking money, man!

55:34.999 --> 55:36.832
The only reason
I'm giving you a chance here

55:36.834 --> 55:38.634
is because I'm taking
pity on you.

55:38.636 --> 55:41.003
Now, you can pay me $9.25
or you can go to jail.

55:41.005 --> 55:42.771
You have 15 seconds
to decide.

55:42.773 --> 55:44.373
No!

55:45.076 --> 55:47.343
What? No!

55:47.345 --> 55:49.912
Let me the fuck out of here!

55:49.914 --> 55:52.414
What the fuck?

55:53.884 --> 55:56.085
What the fuck?

55:56.087 --> 55:57.519
No!

56:05.029 --> 56:08.497
And she calls me
a fucking pussy.

56:08.499 --> 56:11.467
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

56:11.469 --> 56:13.602
I... fucking you hate you!

56:13.604 --> 56:15.771
- I fucking hate you, too!
- Good!

56:15.773 --> 56:18.774
I hope you're the guy
that they rape fuck in prison!

56:18.776 --> 56:21.477
I'm sure I will be!

56:21.479 --> 56:23.812
Time's up,
what have you decided?

56:27.685 --> 56:29.518
Oh, fuck.

56:31.122 --> 56:33.389
Here's five bucks, OK.

56:38.596 --> 56:40.095
You did hold out on me.

56:40.097 --> 56:42.765
- It's $9.25.
- What?

56:42.767 --> 56:45.033
Nine dollars
and 25 cents please.

56:45.035 --> 56:48.170
No, look, that's all
the money we have, man.

56:48.172 --> 56:51.540
- I swear.
- Nine dollars and 25 cents or jail.

56:52.943 --> 56:55.144
- OK.
- No, no, OK...

56:56.680 --> 56:58.046
Wait.

57:11.562 --> 57:13.529
Hey, look at that,
you both had money.

57:14.832 --> 57:17.199
Seventy-five cent tip
which is not quite 10%,

57:17.201 --> 57:19.835
which is about what
I would expect from you, so...

57:22.940 --> 57:25.140
Maybe I was wrong,
maybe you're not together.

57:42.760 --> 57:47.629
So, I guess this is
fuck you for good then.

57:50.634 --> 57:51.834
Yep.

57:54.605 --> 57:55.838
Well...

57:56.774 --> 57:59.074
Fuck you, I guess.

58:02.980 --> 58:04.746
Fuck you, too.

59:42.980 --> 59:45.781
No, what, no, who? No.

59:45.783 --> 59:49.117
Look at you being all stealthy.

59:49.119 --> 59:53.121
Sneaking around like
a little Carmen Sandiego.

59:53.123 --> 59:55.657
I just...
need to use the bathroom.

59:55.659 --> 59:57.059
OK, I smell like
a Chinese food dumpster.

59:57.061 --> 59:58.660
Yeah, any port
in a storm, right?

59:58.662 --> 01:00:00.963
Hey, hey, whoa, easy.

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:03.765
We both know why
you're here, right?

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.935
Somebody needs
her vitamins, right?

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:10.739
Don't worry, these little babies
are gonna pick you up,

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:14.876
they're gonna dust you off
and gonna set you right as rain.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.246
Yeah, gotta let the world
be your oyster,

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:22.918
and you are the motherfucking
oyster shucker, right?

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.822
As soon as
I fucking get this open,

01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:30.392
then you can fucking shuck the
whole world like your oyster.

01:00:30.394 --> 01:00:31.860
Fucking...

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.297
You're gonna have to do that.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:38.967
I'm good.

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:43.872
You're good? Huh?

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:46.375
Is that... Is that what
you just said to me?

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:48.010
You're good?

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:50.812
Sorry.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:56.218
What I meant to say
was fuck you,

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.320
you drunk driving motherfucker.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:01.223
The only reason that you shake
is because you're scared

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:03.225
that people will find out
that you are a piece of shit.

01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:05.327
Well, guess what,
you are a piece of shit.

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:07.929
You piece of shit
and fuck you.

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:10.065
- Let go!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:12.067
It's all right,
it's all right, it's OK...

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:15.070
Come on, come on,
just sit down, all right.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.674
See, you're not gonna hit me.

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.909
Are you?

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:23.879
'Cause you know that I'm all
you've got in the world.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.381
OK. Maybe I've been

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:28.316
too hard on you,
I will concede that.

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:31.019
But let's just put
all that behind us, you know.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:35.223
Like, bygones under the bridge
and all that shit, right?

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:40.328
It's time to recognize we've
gotta get the band back together.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.832
Here we go.
Now, let momma bird feed her young.

01:01:45.903 --> 01:01:48.336
Good. There.

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:01.817
No, no, it's not breaking and
entering, if it's my mattress!

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.155
- Paulie, what the hell?
- Turn around, all right.

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.124
Can't you see we're in
a rebuilding phase here?

01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.759
Jesus Christ, man,
leave her alone.

01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:12.294
Be somewhere else.

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:14.296
Hey,
what don't you understand?

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:15.897
I will carve a doodle
in your face

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:18.734
and it will be by accident,
all right?

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:25.040
I'm... I'm sorry, what the fuck
are you looking at?

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:27.275
Hmm?

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:32.914
Oh, yeah, there you go.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.951
Slink away,
you pussy-ass piece of shit.

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.919
Fucking Eeyore
looking motherfucker.

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:48.764
OK...

01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:52.501
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:55.937
Oh, God.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:59.241
One second, one second,
one second, one second...

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.176
Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.857
- I thought you ran off.
- Came back.

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:18.493
It's not every day I get
to see you not be a pussy.

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.962
All right, Paul, you need to...

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.130
Fuck, Jesus.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:23.832
Oh, fuck.

01:03:23.834 --> 01:03:27.803
Oh! Oh, fuck is something
to know about.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.137
What do you wanna do
with this fuck face?

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:33.542
I don't know. I mean,
we've got a corkscrew.

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:35.010
- Oh, yeah.
- Hacksaw.

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:36.545
Chablis!
Oh, thank God.

01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:39.414
Go, go, go, pow,
sick these fuckers, get 'em.

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.882
Fuck 'em up.

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:44.953
Can I get a white Russian,
Kevin?

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:47.189
Yes, yes, you may.

01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:50.158
Fuck, can you fucking...

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:54.863
Hey, hey.

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:57.432
You will never fuck with anyone
in this bar again.

01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:59.601
You will never carry
that knife ever again.

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.837
And you will never touch
Lacie ever again.

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:03.471
I can't really control
my touches, so...

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:08.210
Oh, fuck, fuck, OK, OK, OK,
no more bad touches.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:10.378
And another thing...

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.516
This here is my golden chap.

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:16.384
Handshake.

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:19.888
This here is my
golden handshake.

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.258
That's it?

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.127
You're not gonna claw my face
or bash my balls in

01:04:26.129 --> 01:04:28.396
or anything like that?

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:31.166
- Nope.
- Really?

01:04:35.939 --> 01:04:37.873
All right,
wait, wait, wait, please.

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:40.542
Just give me,
just let me say this, all right.

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:44.012
I know that I tried too hard,
that's always been my problem,

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:47.415
but, you know
maybe it's because...

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.651
I'm scared that people
aren't gonna like me--

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:53.221
- Get your shit together.
- Thank you, all right.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.556
That's fair.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.124
How you doing, you all right?

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:58.460
No, I smell like
a garbage truck.

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:00.262
- OK.
- Wow!

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:03.265
You kind of did something
for someone else there.

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:05.066
I'm proud of you, brother.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.368
Fifty bucks!

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:09.137
What?

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.506
- Fifty bucks.
- Told you I'd make you fuck that napkin, bro.

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:15.277
Oh, fuck you, for real?
You're gonna hold me to that?

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:19.080
Uh, hold you to a promise
you made your brother, yeah.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:22.484
No, no, don't do that.
Don't emphasize promise and brother

01:05:22.486 --> 01:05:24.052
like it means something
to you.

01:05:24.054 --> 01:05:26.054
Look, you wanted me gone.

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:30.058
This is... now you got it,
this is your going away gift.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.562
My going gift is you leaving
and me paying for half?

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.131
You're welcome.

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:37.432
That... fuck you,

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.000
that doesn't
make any fucking sense.

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:41.036
Owen, I only said that I...

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.407
You know what, fine, go.

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:50.412
You wanna go, fucking go, get out of
my fucking bar, you fucking prick.

01:05:50.414 --> 01:05:53.715
I hope your bus flips
and you fucking die.

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:56.584
You know, this is like,
this is like having a cyst removed.

01:05:56.586 --> 01:05:59.454
This is like having
a skin tag burned off.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:02.724
This is like being born a
hunchback and the doctor saying,

01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:04.993
"Kevin, guess what,
we cured that shit.

01:06:04.995 --> 01:06:06.494
Here you go, hump gone."

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.096
"What, I don't have
to walk around

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:12.534
with this fucking lump
on my back anymore?"

01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:14.970
"Nope, that's gone,
that'll be 50 bucks."

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:18.707
Well, that's a fucking deal.
That is a fucking bargain.

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:21.076
That's the best money
I've ever spent.

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:23.111
So, good fucking riddance.

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:30.318
We've gotta have
a goodbye drink.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.354
Hey?

01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:33.355
Kev, I'm buying.

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:35.223
I'm buying a round.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:38.226
No, I'm buying.

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:40.628
- Wow.
- Nothing but the best.

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.641
To new starts.

01:06:56.747 --> 01:06:58.246
Cheers.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:03.551
What the fuck is that?

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:07.522
Some asshole replaced it
with soda pop.

01:07:11.294 --> 01:07:13.161
Gonna miss you.

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:19.567
I tell you, I am not gonna
miss this fucking city.

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:21.536
Man, all the honking
and hustling,

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.638
I don't care how gross
that house is.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.341
All the fucking cat shit is
better than this fucking place.

01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:27.642

How the fuck should I know?

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:35.737
Your made-up watch
is a Casio?

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.604
Way to dream big.

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:40.441
Fuck you.

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:43.645
Yeah, fuck you, too.
It's 12:30.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.314
What?

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.350
We leave in 20 minutes.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:56.524
OK. Yeah, OK,
that's... soon.

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.726
Yeah, I mean, good, right?

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:01.396
I mean,
I hate waiting for stuff.

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:03.431
Yeah, me too.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.568
Leave this shithole behind.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.270
- New start.
- Yeah, everything different.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:11.906
- Different everything.
- Sorry, excuse us.

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:14.676
- Hi.
- Hi, yeah we're sorry to bother you.

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:17.545
We're looking for Union Station,
but we got confused.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.882
- We're late for our train.
- You see this a bus station,

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:24.519
but apparently the trains
go into Union Station, I guess.

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:26.254
Could you show us
where that is on the map?

01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:30.325
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure thing, guys.

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:33.561
OK, you're right here on the corner of
fuck you and figure it out yourself.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.464
Oh, yeah, and you know what else you
should check out while you're in town?

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:39.367
It's called the brain clinic, so you can
figure out how fucking stupid you are.

01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:41.302
You can't read
a fucking map.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:43.871
Yeah, also, check out the
shoe museum while you're here.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:46.674
- Why the shoe museum?
- 'Cause it's for fucking losers!

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:47.875
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh.

01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:48.977
I'm sorry.

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:50.378
No, you know what,
forget it.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.813
Don't worry about it.

01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:53.615
You and this city
deserve each other.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:56.417
- Way to represent.
- Oh, OK, yeah, yeah.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:59.320
- We deserve each other.
- Fuck you.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:01.489
Way to represent.

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.624
Fucking we deserve each other,

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:03.758
what does that even mean?

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.326
Represent what?

01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:06.628
Represent getting
the fuck out of here, baby.

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:08.496
I'll fucking represent
these nuts.

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:11.833
You know what?

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:13.901
That is just unbelievable.

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:26.781
You know what, fuck this.

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:29.917
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, map guys.

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:32.287
We're gonna help you
with your stupid problem.

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:34.022
Come on, we'll show you
where to go, we promise.

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:35.923
- Yeah, yeah.
- We promise, we're not gonna bite.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:37.992
- OK, thank you.
- OK.

01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:39.927
Right, you're here.

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:41.529
You wanna go down
to Bay and Front,

01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:43.898
- that's it, home free.
- Bam. Bam.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.933
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Amazing!

01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:47.935
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You two are amazing,

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:49.070
good luck in all
your future endeavors.

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:51.939
- Take care.
- Bye.

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:54.008
We showed them.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.681
- Who showed who?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:02.050
- Yeah. OK.
- OK.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.852
Two tickets
to Brockville, please?

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:06.454
Ninety-eight bucks, right?

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:10.325
Uh, yes, that's correct.

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:15.363
Dude,
do you have the envelope?

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:18.666
- I... No, I don't...
- I don't have it.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.668
- So, obviously--
- Are you fucking serious?

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.904
- Sir.
- Don't, no...

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:25.640
No, no, no, I must have given it to
you, I must have given it to you.

01:12:25.642 --> 01:12:27.008
- What do you mean?
- I must have given it...

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.194
No, you said I was too stupid
to carry it, remember?

01:12:29.195 --> 01:12:31.379
- You said over your dead little body, you said.
- Yeah, no, I don't have it.

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:32.613
- I don't have it.
- You just had it!

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:34.749
I don't have it now!

01:12:37.087 --> 01:12:39.754
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:41.823
Those dumb tourists, fuck.

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:44.025
When... when we were
showing them the map.

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:47.395
Sir, could you and your
girlfriend please step aside

01:12:47.397 --> 01:12:49.397
so that I'll be available
to assist people

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:51.666
who are actually
going somewhere.

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:04.145
- You dumb fuck.
- Oh, like you sniffed out them.

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:06.948
- Stupid dumb fuck.
- OK, I'm stupid and dumb.

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:08.783
That's a real one-two punch.

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.752
Oh, what about
the one-two punch

01:13:10.754 --> 01:13:12.553
of me punching you
and then punching you again?

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.088
Oh, now you're a rough houser?

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:16.891
Wow, you throw one half a bike,
at one guy, one time!

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.660
- To save you!
- You didn't save shit!

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:21.462
You are shit.

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:23.431
I knew it the moment that
you stiffed me on that hand job.

01:13:23.433 --> 01:13:25.032
You stiffed me
on that hand job!

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:27.602
Oh, OK, yeah, my poor penis,
my poor little penis.

01:13:27.604 --> 01:13:29.537
You are the least valuable
player here, LVP!

01:13:29.539 --> 01:13:32.974
No, LVP you! I am the hustler,
you are the fuck up.

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:35.176
You are the weak link,
I am the brains.

01:13:35.178 --> 01:13:37.078
You know what, those losers
were right about you,

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.480
you belong to this city
'cause you're both assholes.

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:41.983
Me? You should marry
this shit suck city,

01:13:41.985 --> 01:13:43.718
you're perfect for each other!

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.721
- You know what, fuck you!
- Fuck you, you!

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:04.939
OK, OK, ready, go.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.542
- Dog-napping.
- You're an idiot.

01:14:07.544 --> 01:14:09.076
Oops, no wait,
that's three words,

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:10.645
does that mess up
the brainstorming?

01:14:10.647 --> 01:14:12.180
I'm just saying
rich people have dogs,

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:14.115
you take one
and you leave a note.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.017
What are you guys
talking about?

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:18.019
Oh, we're gonna buy
the bar popcorn machine,

01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:19.787
it's gonna solve
all our problems.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.222
We can't afford
a popcorn machine.

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:23.090
Duh, that's why
we're stealing a dog.

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:25.126
Wait, how we will know
where to send the ransom note?

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.662
Ooh, right, OK,
so we leave the note.

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:29.630
How will they contact us?

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:30.798
Right.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.067
You could get a PO box.

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:36.471
Yes, Kevin coming through
with the big ideas.

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:38.940
I love it. That's totally
what we're gonna do,

01:14:38.942 --> 01:14:41.042
we're getting ourselves
a PO box, done, bam.

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:44.545
Except you can't afford one
and you don't know what it is.

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:46.547
Right.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:49.083
What about a meat truck?

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:51.152
I like...
well, I need more information.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.187
I see one everyday
down the street at the butchers.

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:54.989
When the guy goes in
to make his delivery,

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.024
we just sneak right in there
and steal a side of beef.

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:59.026
Wait, who is gonna buy
a side of beef?

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.028
How much?

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.832
- Twenty bucks.
- Yeah, I'd buy that.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.901
See, Cerebral would buy it.

01:15:06.903 --> 01:15:09.237
I mean, Paul.

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:12.640
Thank you.

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:15.643
Can you top up
my White Russian, Kevin?

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:17.612
Yep.

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:18.846
I'll get it.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.181
Lacie'll get it.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:22.149
You know who's really
asking for it?

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:24.919
You know that black kid
selling chocolate almonds.

01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:26.153
He's gotta have, like,
50 bucks on him.

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:28.022
Oh, down on... Sherborne.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.624
- Yeah, yeah.
- That kid's a shark.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:30.892
Right?

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:54.882
We could do that map scam?

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.984
Pretend that we're tourists.

01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:01.589
Nobody'd believe it.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:09.664
