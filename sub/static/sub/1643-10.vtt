If we talked about who had motive
to kill Terrence, we'd be here all clay.

- Do the math.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.748
Yeah. So?

00:39.831 --> 00:42.793

It's looking seriously deficient.

We've been doing business too long.
We can fix this thing, right?

02:29.524 --> 02:32.569
Let's get something clear.
You and I haven't done crap.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.781
- Falzone's the one's been paying me.
- Falzone is just an envelope.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.200
You've been doing business with me
face to face.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.620

but I'm not that dumb.

02:47.793 --> 02:52.214
Falzone's envelope is the only reason
I come through that fence every day.

02:52.297 --> 02:56.134
And it's the only reason I'm gonna
keep coming through that fence

02:56.551 --> 02:59.179
until I have enough money
to buy that house on Lake Gray.

02:59.763 --> 03:03.350
I'm thinking early retirement, John.
And you're interfering with that.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.686
Hey, boss, just give me some time

03:06.103 --> 03:08.563
and I can match
whatever Falzone is paying you.

Hey, boss. Boss!

They're gonna find it.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.554
The longer they're in there,
the sooner they're gonna find it.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.889
- Then we've got to get back in there.
- Yeah.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.517
I'm gonna say
something crazy to you right now.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.269
Surprise, surprise.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.188
Well, I don't give a damn
about that Fibonacci anymore.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.023
You're right, that is crazy.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.444
Because I got bigger things to think about,
like survival.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.740
You see, I'm kind of short on friends
in here, in case you haven't noticed.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.747
I need to get out right now,
while I still got my life.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.166
Then why are we talking about Fibonacci?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.752
Well, the only way
I can get that room back

04:11.835 --> 04:14.254
is if I can prove to Falzone
that I'm still worthy.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.589
That I still got what it takes. Yeah?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.177
And the only way I can do that
is if I can give him Fibonacci.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.263
Interesting.

04:23.889 --> 04:27.893
You see, this is not
a me versus you thing anymore.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.395
This is us. An us thing here, right?

04:30.896 --> 04:33.523

04:33.940 --> 04:36.818
Or is this about you getting back
in good with the mob again?

04:36.902 --> 04:41.156
That life is over for me, Fish.
I mean, they clipped my wings.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.366
They want me to rot in here.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.996
- So I got no allegiance to them anymore.
- And yet you still want to do them a favor.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.210
Falzone is desperate.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.756
You see, if Fibonacci testifies
in front of the Congress next month,

04:57.839 --> 05:00.175
Falzone is gonna go down in flames.

05:00.550 --> 05:04.095
But if we give him Fibonacci,
he will give us anything.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.444
Flowers that end up dead
and in the trash a week later.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.739
That sounded bitter, huh?

15:07.573 --> 15:08.825
Kind of.

15:08.950 --> 15:12.495
It's not a big deal. You are all set.
I will see you tomorrow.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.788
Okay.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.626
I'm sorry you feel that way.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.213
About the flowers, I mean.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.676
(DOOR CLOSES)

15:28.344 --> 15:29.554
(PLAN KS CLATTERING)

15:29.637 --> 15:32.014
Hey, somebody get on this.
I want these in the other room.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.349
I got it, boss.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.518
Hey, Chill, IilyWhite, I got it.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.627
Come on.
I know you're around here somewhere.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.388
(WOOD CREAKING)

16:32.909 --> 16:36.245
NICK: He's not doing well, is he?
VERONICA: He just lost his mother.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.374
Ten days from now he loses his father.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.927
NICK: How you holding up?

16:55.640 --> 16:57.141
You know, I...

16:58.267 --> 17:00.895
I sort of get
what you're going through here, LJ.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.608
No disrespect,
but I don't know that you do.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.444
No, with my dad.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.074
I was in the same spot
when I was your age.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.242
He was in prison.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.246
And like your dad, he was innocent.

17:18.788 --> 17:22.541
What happened?
I mean, you know, at the end.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.170
What I hope happens here.
He got exonerated.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.133
- What'd they say he did?
- A lot of bad things.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.137
They weren't true and we proved that.

17:36.264 --> 17:39.809
Every day, every day was a lost cause,
but we kept fighting.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.479
I mean, what else you gonna do
when you love somebody?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.314
You gonna let them go out like that?

17:45.606 --> 17:47.108
So you fight.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.860
You keep fighting. You never give up.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.826
We're gonna beat this thing, okay?

18:06.210 --> 18:07.878
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.465
You were expecting me?
Mutual friend arranged...

18:11.549 --> 18:12.592
Yes.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.969
- You mind if I...
- Please.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.387
(CHUCKUNG)

18:16.846 --> 18:18.389
Hey. How are...

18:18.598 --> 18:19.599
(WHISTLES)

18:22.810 --> 18:24.270
KELLERMAN: I'm sorry
I didn't get your name.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.605
Quinn.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.899
Mr. Quinn, mind telling us
what we're doing here?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.736
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Well, you can
probably tell just by looking at me

18:31.819 --> 18:33.738
I'm not a wave-making sort.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.699
Just think of me as a supervisor

18:36.782 --> 18:39.785
who's here to make sure
things are under control as we approach,

18:39.869 --> 18:41.370
you know, the big event.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.748
I wasn't aware that things
are out of control.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.208
Well, you would be the one
that would know, wouldn't you?

18:46.459 --> 18:47.460
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

18:51.130 --> 18:55.384
Well, the reason I'm here
is because there's a discrepancy

18:55.468 --> 18:58.554
between what you know and
what you have said to the Vice President.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.097
The lawyers you tried to blow up,

19:00.181 --> 19:02.683
they're still running around
healthy as thoroughbreds.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.727
You know it, I know it.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.854
Same thing goes with the kid.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.106
(CHUCKLES) You know,
who you were silly enough

19:09.190 --> 19:11.942
to tell the old lady
that you were actually in possession of.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.029
Now everything that I'm saying
is boiling down to this.

19:15.488 --> 19:19.450
You got to hand the reins over to me now
so that I can save your ass.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.916
First of all...

19:26.999 --> 19:27.958
(YELLING)

19:28.918 --> 19:30.461
No, no!

19:30.961 --> 19:33.381
See, now you made me make a wave.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.383
(GROANING)

19:35.800 --> 19:38.886
You and your partner are off the job
until further notice.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.764
It doesn't come from me.
It doesn't come from the White House.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.683
It comes from the Company.
You understand?

19:54.110 --> 19:56.946
Look, your proximal and middle phalanx
are broken.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.115
Just ice it for 45 minutes then splint it.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.785
That's what a doctor would tell you to do.
So you don't need to go see one.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.973
Ecofield's SEC filings.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.059
Terrence Steadman was murdered
so the information from his indictment

20:27.143 --> 20:28.978
-wouldn't be made public, right?
- Sure.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.521
But since it never saw the light of day,

20:30.604 --> 20:33.065
we have no way of knowing
what they were trying to cover up.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.860
Steadman's wife said there were
hundreds of millions of dollars at stake

20:35.943 --> 20:37.611
if her husband went down.

20:37.695 --> 20:40.865
So I figure we follow the money
and see where it takes us.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.659
$109 million. $212 million.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.788
Over half a billion dollars that I've found
so far in federal grants to Ecofield

20:47.872 --> 20:49.957
for alternative fuel research.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.418
- That is a hell of a lot of money.
- But for what?

20:52.501 --> 20:54.754
Not only did the company
never make a profit,

20:54.837 --> 20:57.381
as far as I could tell,
they never made anything.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.760
Look. No fuel cells, no patents,
no findings. Nothing.

21:00.843 --> 21:05.014
- So Ecofield was a sham, it was a cover.
- Question is, for what?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.069
Philly.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.908
Sit down, kid.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.081
So.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.334
Fibonacci.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.587
- How'd you find him?
- Did my homework.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.259
You get elliptical with me
for one more second,

21:42.343 --> 21:44.220
and I will cancel you.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.515
- You understand me?
- Give it up, Fish.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.603
Before someone's transferred
to the US Marshals Service

21:52.686 --> 21:56.941
and placed in witness protection,
they're guarded by a local sheriff

21:57.942 --> 21:59.985
from the county
where the trial will take place.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.783
SCOFIELD: Sheriff Solomon, please.
OPERATOR: <i>Please hold.</i>

22:07.618 --> 22:09.411
<i>Andrew Solomon here.</i>

22:13.290 --> 22:17.670
<i>SCOFIELD: If the sheriff was available,
then he wasn't the one guarding Fibonacci.</i>

22:17.753 --> 22:19.588
<i>RECEPTIONIST: Putnam County
Sheriff's Office.</i>

22:19.672 --> 22:22.049
Yeah, is Sheriff Pronzo there?

22:22.132 --> 22:24.844
<i>I'm sorry, Sheriff Pronzo's on vacation.</i>

22:24.927 --> 22:26.679
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.139
<i>There were only four sheriffs
in the county.</i>

22:29.765 --> 22:32.726
And since Pronzo was the only one
who wasn't in his office,

22:32.810 --> 22:35.020
and his wife and kids
were waiting for him at home,

22:35.104 --> 22:38.232
I knew the only vacation he was taking
was with Fibonacci.

22:38.315 --> 22:41.485
Watching him
until they could put him in protection.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.612
Thing is, sometimes it takes weeks

22:43.696 --> 22:46.031
for the Marshals Service
to set up a new identity.

22:46.115 --> 22:50.286
So some local sheriff is stuck
in the middle of nowhere with Fibonacci.

22:50.369 --> 22:54.331
He gets lonely and calls home. A lot.

22:56.959 --> 23:00.379
<i>I called the phone company.
Said I was Pronzo, and I'd lost my bill.</i>

23:02.006 --> 23:03.966
<i>I asked for another copy.</i>

23:05.009 --> 23:08.804
<i>It seems Mrs. Pronzo was receiving
dozens of calls from an area code</i>

23:08.888 --> 23:10.848
<i>a long way from Chicago.</i>

23:12.600 --> 23:15.978
I went online,
reverse-traced the number, and voilé.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.481
There was Fibonacci's exact location.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.986
- How do you know he's still there?
- I have someone looking after him.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.530
Watching from afar, in case he moves.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.494
This is about money, isn't it?

23:32.578 --> 23:35.205
- You're an astute man, Mr. Falzone.
- What?

23:35.289 --> 23:38.667
Your friend here, John,
is trying to extort me.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.920
Not extortion. Insurance.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.339
I plan on being out of here one day.

23:43.422 --> 23:47.051
And I don't think my new résumé
is going to cut it in most places.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.470
- How much?
-$200,000.

23:51.013 --> 23:53.682
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Quid pro quo.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.685
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.271
Well, I'll give you some quid pro quo.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.902
Where did you get this?

24:07.696 --> 24:09.031
Who took this picture?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.866
Well, since you took it upon yourself

24:10.950 --> 24:13.744
to have some people watching
over our interests on the outside,

24:13.827 --> 24:17.289
we took it upon ourselves
to have some people watching over yours.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.916
So who's it gonna be?

24:18.999 --> 24:22.670
Fibonacci or your pretty
little girlfriend there?

24:35.808 --> 24:40.479
Yeah, you should be careful
with who visits you in here, Fish.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.773
These walls have eyes.

24:43.107 --> 24:47.194
If you touch her, I'll kill you myself.

24:48.779 --> 24:53.117
One: That is an empty threat.
You are less than a gnat to me.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.578
And two: All you gotta do
is give me the address,

24:56.662 --> 24:59.748
and we avoid
all this melodrama altogether.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.255
The address, you gnat.

25:07.756 --> 25:08.799
Now.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.096
Promise me...

25:16.140 --> 25:18.892
Promise me it'll be quick and painless.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.729
- Do you believe this guy?
- Promise me.

25:21.812 --> 25:25.357
If the next thing
that comes out of your mouth

25:25.441 --> 25:27.234
is not that address,

25:27.317 --> 25:30.821
there's gonna be a lot of pain
in a lot of places.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.376
Canada.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.131
345 Hamilton Avenue,

25:50.924 --> 25:53.052
Thunder Bay, Ontario.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.845
Get out of here.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.362
Nice work, John.

26:14.490 --> 26:18.452
I guess the demise of John Abruzzi
was greatly exaggerated.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.206
Thank you. I appreciate it.

26:22.581 --> 26:26.210
Could you do me a favor
and fix this Bellick thing for me?

26:26.543 --> 26:28.462
Yeah, consider it done.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.549
Thank you. And Philly,

26:33.509 --> 26:35.761
before you pull the trigger,

26:35.844 --> 26:40.641
look the son of a bitch in his eyes
and tell him John Abruzzi said goodbye.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.842
VICE PRESIDENT: "In the race toward
worldwide peace and prosperity,

27:14.925 --> 27:16.677
"America will set the pace."

27:17.052 --> 27:20.347
"Race?" Rat race, arms race.

27:20.430 --> 27:24.059
Can you think of a word
with a worse connotation? Fix it.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.938
You send me a babysitter?

27:29.857 --> 27:33.485
- This is not the time or the place.
- This is the time and the place.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.028
Don't take that tone with me.

27:35.112 --> 27:39.032
Remember who you are talking to.
I am the Vice President of this country.

27:39.116 --> 27:42.911
No, actually, you're Caroline Reynolds
from Montgomery, Illinois.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.747
I know exactly who you are.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.668
Come with me.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.262
There is something
you need to understand.

28:00.345 --> 28:04.391
If you had done your job,
I never would have had to ask for Quinn.

28:04.474 --> 28:07.102
And there's something
you need to understand.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.772
You woke a sleeping beast
when you called these guys in.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.733
They have a bigger agenda than any of us

28:12.816 --> 28:15.736
and they get real nasty real quick
if things don't go their way.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.529
So now, no one is safe.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.115
Not you. Not me.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.368
Let's not overreact.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.371
I mean, I know everyone is nervous
about tomorrow.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.123
I understand that.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.210
But the one thing
both of us have to remember

28:31.293 --> 28:33.962
is that we are in this together, okay?

28:34.296 --> 28:36.757
All I'm saying is,
these guys are into this thing now,

28:36.840 --> 28:38.842
and there's no going back.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.887
That's bad news for everyone.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.445
Sebastian Balfour?

28:59.863 --> 29:00.948
Yeah.

29:01.031 --> 29:04.493
Yeah, I'm Nestor Pollock,
Midwestern Life and Casualty.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.120
I'm already covered. Thanks.

29:07.204 --> 29:10.123
Oh, no, I'm here
to discuss Veronica Donovan.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.585
- What about her?
- Well, we've been trying to track her down

29:13.669 --> 29:17.547
with respect to the property damage
from the apartment explosion.

29:17.631 --> 29:21.385
- Explosion?
- You didn't know? Oh, I'm sorry.

29:22.052 --> 29:25.472
It's just that her records,
they list you as her fiancé,

29:25.555 --> 29:27.557
-so I assumed...
- Hold on.

29:27.641 --> 29:30.519
- Is Veronica okay?
- Well, there has been a fatality.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.728
Oh, my God.

29:31.812 --> 29:34.648
No, but the medical examiners
haven't been able to identify

29:34.731 --> 29:36.441
the remains with any certainty.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.361
So Veronica could be okay.
We just can't find her.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.196
We were hoping you could help.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.561
Rozz.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.356
Reese.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.736
Burrows.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.915
Blueberry pancakes, huh?

30:33.999 --> 30:37.669
All right, man. You got it.
Blueberry pancakes.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.227
FALZONEI "341 ."

32:24.359 --> 32:25.986
"345."

32:31.074 --> 32:32.451
This is it.

32:34.244 --> 32:37.706
All right. That's it, kids. Time for bed.
Give me a kiss.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.879
You okay down there, boy? Night-night.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.216
All right, sweetheart, give me a kiss.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.401
- Kids are down.
- Thanks.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.073
Tonight we send a message, gentlemen.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.744
We are gonna hurt him and his family
the way he hurt ours.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.645
WOMAN: Oh, honey.
FIBONACCI: Yeah?

33:41.728 --> 33:44.606
Can you change the timer on the sprinkler
while you're out there?

33:44.689 --> 33:45.732
Okay.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.442
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.781
(POLICE SIREN SOUNDING)

33:52.864 --> 33:54.199
OFFICER 1: Freeze!

33:54.282 --> 33:55.909
OFFICER 2: Drop your weapons!
OFFICER 3: Freeze!

33:55.992 --> 33:57.285
Put it down!

33:57.369 --> 33:58.537
Down! Down!

33:58.620 --> 34:01.122
- Drop your weapons.
- I said drop it!

34:06.962 --> 34:10.005
- Down!
- Son of a bitch.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.134
Come on.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.409
Hi, it's John. You wanted to talk to me?

34:37.576 --> 34:39.578
MAGGIO: Yeah. You hear the <i>news?</i>

34:39.828 --> 34:42.664
<i>Falzone got popped last night
up in Canada.</i>

34:43.206 --> 34:46.626
<i>International gun charges,
parole violation.</i>

34:47.710 --> 34:49.170
<i>He's in deep.</i>

34:54.509 --> 34:58.221
- You threw away your flowers.
- Yeah, like I said, they don't last.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.808
I don't think they're dead yet.

35:03.602 --> 35:07.188
I don't like getting attached to things
if I know they won't last.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.357
Here you go.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.860
Why are you so cynical?

35:13.278 --> 35:15.739
Michael, I think there's cynicism
and then there's realism.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.575
And there's optimism. Hope. Faith.

35:18.908 --> 35:22.203
This coming from an eight-toed guy
locked away in a penitentiary.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.039
Toes are overrated.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.126
Thank you for trying to make me smile.
Not today.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.879
- You never know.
- We're all set.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.746
You and I have a lot to talk about,
don't we, Fish?

36:04.913 --> 36:08.750
Seems Philly Falzone
ran into some problem up in Canada

36:09.084 --> 36:11.878
just because of the information
you gave him.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.338
What kind of trouble?

36:13.421 --> 36:16.299
International gun charges,
parole violation.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.260
He's going to go away for a long time.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.429
How do you feel about that?

36:22.430 --> 36:24.057
Pretty darn good.

36:27.977 --> 36:30.814
- And what about Pl?
- We got that back, too.

36:31.356 --> 36:34.984
Falzone paid Bellick yesterday.
So we're good, for now.

36:35.068 --> 36:37.153
- It all worked out.
- It sure did.

36:37.237 --> 36:40.907
- Nicely done. You're a hell of an actor.
- Thank you.

36:42.033 --> 36:45.620
Well, this helped. It's nice. Nice shot.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.956
Where'd you take it?

36:48.665 --> 36:52.502
It's Lincoln's, from back in the day.
Camping trip or something.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.797
- So when do we get back in that room?
- Right away.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.216
- Well, let's get to it.
- Yeah.

36:59.968 --> 37:02.095
Oh, there's one more thing.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.936
You are gonna give me Fibonacci
once we're outside these walls, right?

37:11.438 --> 37:12.772
Of course.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.569
Thank you.

37:18.695 --> 37:22.490
But I think I'll keep this as insurance.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.549
LINCOLN: More juice?

37:39.632 --> 37:41.801
Why can't we have breakfast every day?

37:41.885 --> 37:45.221
You should have breakfast every day, LJ.
It's an important meal.

37:45.305 --> 37:48.516
No, why can't I have breakfast
with you every day?

37:48.600 --> 37:50.560
Nothing would make me happier.

37:50.643 --> 37:54.856
But your mommy and me,
we don't live together anymore.

37:55.231 --> 37:56.524
Why?

37:57.692 --> 38:01.488
Well, sometimes that happens
with mommies and daddies.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.202
But you know what?
You're the luckiest boy in the world,

38:07.452 --> 38:11.372
'cause your mommy loves you very much
and I love you very much.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.208
I'll tell you what.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.586
How about every Sunday
we have our own special breakfast,

38:16.669 --> 38:18.171
just you and me?

38:18.254 --> 38:19.714
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:19.881 --> 38:21.925
- Little bit, or a handful?
- Handful.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.301
A handful.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.722
Here we go.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.193
Take a walk.

38:45.615 --> 38:47.867
Anyone else want to walk with him?

38:50.078 --> 38:51.079
Yeah.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.167
This is my game.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.378
Looks like our friend got his throne back.

38:58.461 --> 38:59.921
SCOFIELDI Looks like it.

39:01.756 --> 39:05.093
Something tells me
we may have you to thank for that.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.221
- You don't want to know.
- You got that right.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.473
Stretch your legs, old head.

39:20.567 --> 39:23.862
Now, we got a hell of a lot to talk about,
don't we?

39:30.451 --> 39:32.287
I got nothing to say.

39:33.162 --> 39:37.250
Now, you think you can play me,
snowflake, 'cause you got college?

39:37.959 --> 39:41.462
Big school learning, huh?
Well, let me school you.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.424
Darwin wins inside these walls.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.385
Not Einstein. Darwin.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.179
Yard time's over, ladies.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.931
Let's line it up.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.977
I'm not done with you, Fish.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.605
You never even got started.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.667
All right.

40:23.129 --> 40:27.300
We're through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we'll hit that pipe.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.303
- We'll be there by Friday.
- Friday?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.722
Better start making travel arrangements.

40:32.805 --> 40:36.184
SUCRE: Maricruz, here I come, baby.
ABRUZZI: Sardinia, here I come.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.811
- Where are we going?
- Panama.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.688
- Panama?
- Panama.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.524
Darién Gap, south of the Canal.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.194
No roads, no electricity, no cops.

40:47.236 --> 40:50.615
Nothing but white sand beaches
and ice cold beer.

40:51.074 --> 40:53.409
Well, that's nice, but what about our lives?

40:53.493 --> 40:55.995
Well, we'll open a scuba shop.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.498
- Hey, I don't dive.
- Neither do I.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.541
We'll have plenty of time to learn.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.294
Bulls.

41:09.384 --> 41:12.053
This con says he's on the job in here.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.555
No, I don't think so.

41:14.681 --> 41:18.476
- You heard the paisan. Move your ass.
- CO, hold on. One second.

41:25.274 --> 41:27.402
Now, you're sure about that?

41:27.902 --> 41:30.321
Are you sure you can't use an extra hand?

41:30.405 --> 41:32.782
You know anything about construction?

41:32.865 --> 41:35.827
Concrete is my specialty. Can you dig it?

41:39.956 --> 41:43.251
- Okay, boss. Sign him up.
- You got it.

41:52.593 --> 41:55.722
It looks like Darwin wins after all,
eh, Fish?

42:03.563 --> 42:06.774
We have a lot of dots
but no way to connect them.

42:07.150 --> 42:08.943
Nobody's getting rich here.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.236
What about shareholders?

42:10.319 --> 42:12.989
Profits were minimal, they were all
converted back to shares.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.950
Looks like they subcontracted out
some research and development,

42:16.034 --> 42:17.910
but it's pennies
in the grand scheme of things.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.704
Nobody was pulling early retirement.

42:19.787 --> 42:23.374
Yeah, but you can't hide $500 million
just by moving a few decimal points.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.710
<i>REPORTER". In a move anticipated
by many pundits,</i>

42:25.793 --> 42:28.838
<i>Vice President Reynolds announced
she is running for the Presidency.</i>

42:28.921 --> 42:32.425
<i>She made the announcement from
her hometown of Montgomery, Illinois.</i>

42:32.508 --> 42:36.596
<i>The move toward worldwide peace

42:36.679 --> 42:38.181
<i>not a sprint.</i>

42:38.264 --> 42:42.685
<i>But I assure you
America will be setting the pace.</i>

42:43.019 --> 42:45.146
A half a billion dollars
just doesn't disappear.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.065
You could run a small country with that.

42:47.148 --> 42:51.486
<i>The Vice President is reported to have
the largest campaign war chest in history.</i>

42:51.569 --> 42:56.157

are already casting her as the favorite</i>

42:56.240 --> 42:57.909
<i>in the Presidential race.</i>

42:57.992 --> 42:59.535
Maybe not a small country.

43:00.870 --> 43:02.330
Maybe this one.
