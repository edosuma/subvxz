WEBVTT

00:01.381 --> 00:04.048
(film whirring)

00:09.929 --> 00:13.262
(dark foreboding music)

00:37.891 --> 00:40.808
(soft piano music)

00:43.020 --> 00:43.853
- No, no, honey.

00:43.853 --> 00:44.686
That's your rook.

00:44.686 --> 00:45.890
You can't move that way.

00:45.890 --> 00:46.970
- Why not?

00:46.970 --> 00:49.290
- Because whoever invented
this game said so.

00:49.290 --> 00:50.790
- That's not fair.

00:50.790 --> 00:51.623
- [George] Sorry.

00:51.623 --> 00:52.456
Those are the rules.

00:52.456 --> 00:53.750
- Can I change the rules?

00:53.750 --> 00:54.583
- You may not.

00:56.110 --> 00:58.013
Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.

00:58.940 --> 01:00.813
- [Mia] Can I do this?

01:00.813 --> 01:03.070
- Yup, totally legal.

01:03.070 --> 01:04.493
But then I'm gonna do this.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.500
- [Mom] Who wants some cookies?

01:10.420 --> 01:13.690
- Now this is what I'm talking about.

01:13.690 --> 01:15.550
- Honey, try your bishop.

01:15.550 --> 01:16.383
See the opening?

01:19.030 --> 01:20.290
Yeah.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.150
You have to anticipate
your opponent's move.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.640
Always think two or three steps ahead.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.717
That's how you win.

01:28.765 --> 01:32.812
(dark foreboding music)

01:32.812 --> 01:35.979
(wind chimes chiming)

01:38.640 --> 01:40.861
- It's awfully windy all of a sudden.

01:40.861 --> 01:44.194
(dark foreboding music)

01:55.330 --> 01:56.440
- [George] Get Mia into the attic

01:56.440 --> 01:57.640
and close the door behind you.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.020
- [Mom] George.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.263
- Go, do it now.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.820
- Mom, what's wrong?

02:02.820 --> 02:03.990
- Come on.

02:03.990 --> 02:04.890
Don't turn around.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.682
Come on.

02:07.682 --> 02:11.015
(dark foreboding music)

02:14.950 --> 02:17.800
- If you're lookin' for the
girl, she's not here anymore.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.070
I've already called the cops,

02:21.070 --> 02:22.650
so you might wanna get a move on.

02:22.650 --> 02:25.983
(dark foreboding music)

02:35.355 --> 02:36.188
I don't know.

02:36.188 --> 02:37.021
I'd say 6'3, 6'4.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.440
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've
seen him lurking around here

02:40.440 --> 02:42.580
with a few of his friends.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.220
- Can we go out now?

02:44.220 --> 02:45.810
- Not yet, honey.

02:45.810 --> 02:48.940
- No, unfortunately I did not
get a good look at his face.

02:48.940 --> 02:51.990
Doors are all locked,
family's up in the attic

02:51.990 --> 02:54.163
and we'll just stay put
until you guys arrive.

02:55.821 --> 02:56.921
- Oh, it's just daddy.

03:00.933 --> 03:01.766
- Shh.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.380
Cops are sending somebody
over to check things out.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.180
So we're just gonna camp out
up here for a minute, okay?

03:09.130 --> 03:10.100
- I'm scared.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.440
- Oh sweetheart.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.570
Don't worry.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.123
Everything's gonna be all right.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.922
It's all right.

03:17.922 --> 03:19.432
(loud banging)

03:19.432 --> 03:22.221
(dark foreboding music)

03:22.221 --> 03:23.522
(George sighing)

03:23.522 --> 03:26.189
(door creaking)

03:28.020 --> 03:30.680
It's probably the police
entering the house.

03:30.680 --> 03:31.880
They know we're up here.

03:33.906 --> 03:37.239
(dark intriguing music)

03:46.681 --> 03:48.931
- [Mom] George, don't move.

03:50.826 --> 03:54.310
(siren wailing)

03:54.310 --> 03:58.600
- Car 747, 10-97.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.600
10-4, I'm at the front of the residence.

04:01.810 --> 04:02.643
Copy.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.287
Dispatch, I have an open front door.

04:07.287 --> 04:10.370
(dark foreboding music)
(crickets chirping)

04:10.370 --> 04:12.220
- [Dispatch] 747, what's your status?

04:14.300 --> 04:15.133
- [Officer] 747.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.420
I'll be on the second floor.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.290
Now entering the attic space.

04:24.864 --> 04:29.303
(breathes heavily) We
got two adult bodies,

04:30.220 --> 04:31.053
both deceased.

04:32.450 --> 04:33.697
- [Dispatch] There
should be a little girl.

04:33.697 --> 04:34.693
Is she there?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.420
- Negative.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.430
We may have a missing girl on our hands.

04:40.430 --> 04:45.430
(officer breathing heavily)
(crickets chirping)

04:50.200 --> 04:53.490
10-81, 520 Crescent Moon.

04:53.490 --> 04:54.503
Immediate backup.

04:56.980 --> 05:00.313
(dark intriguing music)

05:21.303 --> 05:24.636
(dark foreboding music)

05:34.175 --> 05:36.400
- [Mia] In the darkness,

05:36.400 --> 05:37.330
a missing girl

05:38.430 --> 05:39.263
grew up.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.750
There's a legend haunting these streets

05:49.760 --> 05:52.340
about a secret society of Shadowlurkers

05:54.620 --> 05:57.303
and their rivals the Lamp Bearers.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.370
Echoes of their secret war
ripple throughout the city

06:07.350 --> 06:08.803
like a ghostly serenade.

06:08.803 --> 06:12.136
(soft mysterious music)

06:19.460 --> 06:21.633
Both factions wield great magic;

06:23.810 --> 06:26.153
one holding the power of death.

06:27.620 --> 06:28.453
The other?

06:29.715 --> 06:30.548
Life.

06:34.873 --> 06:38.206
(dark foreboding music)

06:42.319 --> 06:45.569
And just what awaits us in the darkness

06:49.140 --> 06:50.967
and is there any light left at all?

07:10.386 --> 07:13.769
(soft intriguing music)

07:13.769 --> 07:16.384
(people chattering)

07:16.384 --> 07:19.217
(paper crinkling)

07:33.761 --> 07:34.800
- [Carl] Hey, I need a favor.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.960
- Carl.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.670
Hi, I'm actually-

07:37.670 --> 07:40.803
- We're firing (hums) today
and I need you to do it.

07:42.010 --> 07:44.130
- Firing Janet?
- Shh, shh.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.690
Yes, we're firing Janet, okay?

07:45.690 --> 07:47.300
We don't wanna tell the whole office.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.133
- Why?

07:48.133 --> 07:49.030
- Why?

07:49.030 --> 07:50.070
Look at her.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.453
She literally does that all day long.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.553
Almost impressive how inefficient she is.

07:56.980 --> 07:58.510
- Yeah, but why me?

07:58.510 --> 08:00.176
Why do I have to be the
one to break it to her?

08:00.176 --> 08:02.220
- Because I'm her manager, okay?

08:02.220 --> 08:03.620
It'd be awkward if I did it.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.320
Everybody knows she looks up to me

08:06.180 --> 08:09.500
- Yeah, doesn't that mean it'd
be easier coming from you?

08:09.500 --> 08:11.823
- No, it wouldn't make
it easier coming from me.

08:11.823 --> 08:12.950
It'd be easier coming from you

08:12.950 --> 08:15.850
because then you fire her then
she won't know I fired her.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.013
- Yeah, okay.

08:19.270 --> 08:21.660
Carl, I'm not really over Janet.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.470
- Well look, you think of it this way.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.140
It's a proxy firing, okay?

08:25.140 --> 08:27.090
You're not really firing, firing her.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.510
It's a proxy firing.

08:28.510 --> 08:30.670
It's sorta like somebody
else is firing her

08:30.670 --> 08:33.130
and then you get to be the one
that tells her she's fired,

08:33.130 --> 08:34.510
but you're not gettin' blamed for it.

08:34.510 --> 08:35.460
It's a great plan.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.163
Look, you got this, all right?

08:38.240 --> 08:39.680
- I don't think I do.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.410
But at the end of the
day, she's still fired.

08:42.410 --> 08:43.270
- You got it.

08:43.270 --> 08:44.680
It's nothin' to it, all right?

08:44.680 --> 08:47.243
Just make sure you've done it
by the end of the day, okay?

08:48.240 --> 08:49.103
Good man.

08:49.103 --> 08:52.103
(people chattering)

08:57.150 --> 08:58.810
- Marcus,

08:58.810 --> 09:01.370
with all due respect,

09:01.370 --> 09:03.620
I don't think you're
even allowed to fire me.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.280
- Yes, I realize that.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.960
I'm actually Carl's
proxy in this situation.

09:10.960 --> 09:11.793
It was his idea.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.500
- I mean why not fire Pedro?

09:13.500 --> 09:15.200
He barely speaks frickin' English.

09:16.252 --> 09:17.930
- Well Pedro's actually from Anaheim.

09:17.930 --> 09:19.340
- I mean dude just spends all day

09:19.340 --> 09:21.490
hangin' out in the
break room smokin' weed.

09:23.204 --> 09:25.604
- It's actually just
vaping and they allow that.

09:31.250 --> 09:34.920
Carl asked for your
key card before you go.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.960
- This is just so freaking unfair.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.660
I mean why are they
even firing me anyways?

09:38.660 --> 09:39.913
Can I get a reason?

09:41.460 --> 09:44.080
- I believe it has something to do

09:44.080 --> 09:48.493
with the gratuitous use
of your cellphone at work.

09:49.390 --> 09:52.120
I know, I think it's unfair too.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.453
I don't agree with it.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.820
Would you like to get
something to eat after work?

10:01.820 --> 10:02.870
We can talk about it.

10:03.930 --> 10:05.160
- You know what, Marcus?

10:05.160 --> 10:06.193
You can eat shit.

10:07.230 --> 10:08.480
I'm outta here.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.242
- So that's a no.

10:13.242 --> 10:14.736
(rhythmic rock music)
(Marcus knocking)

10:14.736 --> 10:16.824
♪ I'm takin' control ♪

10:16.824 --> 10:17.657
- Hi.

10:17.657 --> 10:19.370
- Hi, you okay?

10:19.370 --> 10:20.453
- [Mom] Yeah.

10:22.533 --> 10:23.366
- You okay?

10:23.366 --> 10:24.711
- He's in his room.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.730
(Marcus knocking)

10:27.730 --> 10:28.763
- You're super late.

10:30.210 --> 10:31.150
- Yeah, sorry.

10:31.150 --> 10:32.740
I got stuck at work havin' to fire someone

10:32.740 --> 10:33.850
who doesn't even work for me.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.280
Tell your mom she can dock my pay.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.030
- I thought we didn't pay you.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.340
- Oh, you don't.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.990
As it turns out
volunteering for Big Brother

10:39.990 --> 10:41.790
wasn't the best career choice after all.

10:41.790 --> 10:43.057
- Har har har.

10:44.390 --> 10:45.970
- Is that a new comic?

10:45.970 --> 10:46.920
- It's an underground.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.520
They say it's based on a true story.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.887
- Really?

10:49.887 --> 10:51.080
"Shadowlurker".

10:51.080 --> 10:52.630
- Yeah, it's about this secret group

10:52.630 --> 10:53.960
called the Fellowship of the Fallen.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.390
You ever heard of it?

10:55.390 --> 10:56.223
- Nope.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.470
If I had, it wouldn't be
much of a secret, would it?

10:59.470 --> 11:01.260
- It's about these creepy assassins

11:01.260 --> 11:02.870
who don't take crap from anybody.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.560
One guy, he lights people on fire

11:04.560 --> 11:06.333
then hangs 'em from light poles.

11:08.159 --> 11:10.793
- That's disturbing.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.950
So in what way is this a true story again?

11:14.950 --> 11:17.680
- Few towns over, they found these bodies.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.723
Guess how they died.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.800
- I'm guessing light poles were involved.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.830
- You look scared.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.517
- [Marcus] I'm not scared, you're scared.

11:25.517 --> 11:28.363
- (chuckles softly)
Anyway, here's the update.

11:31.210 --> 11:32.500
- Oh, very nice.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.220
You've been working hard since last week.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.470
- It's not even good.

11:36.470 --> 11:38.140
I'm just messin' around.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.020
- No, perspective's amazing.

11:40.020 --> 11:41.820
And the shadowing? Yeah.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.187
Here, lemme show you somethin'.

11:44.610 --> 11:45.733
See, with the wings,

11:47.070 --> 11:48.990
you just gotta layer 'em a little bit.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.710
Then you can just mess around, right?

11:51.710 --> 11:53.810
- That's not completely terrible, I guess.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.200
- No, but you were doin' a better job.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.033
Here.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.210
So did you bring my money
to lose to me in poker?

12:03.210 --> 12:04.123
- Oh, come on.

12:06.511 --> 12:09.230
Have you rented out your spare room yet?

12:09.230 --> 12:10.163
- No, not yet.

12:11.551 --> 12:12.960
I'm still workin' on the flyer.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.060
I haven't found the perfect font just yet.

12:17.478 --> 12:19.820
- Why'd you buy such a big
house in the first place?

12:19.820 --> 12:21.520
Seems like a waste of space, dude.

12:23.720 --> 12:24.720
- Well because

12:26.404 --> 12:27.900
I wanted a big family someday

12:27.900 --> 12:30.830
and families need big houses.

12:30.830 --> 12:31.663
- Why's that?

12:32.800 --> 12:35.660
- To do family stuff.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.580
- Sounds a bit premature if you ask me.

12:38.580 --> 12:39.413
- Well I didn't

12:39.413 --> 12:42.423
- I'm just sayin' you might
wanna find a girl first.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.130
- Ouch, Troy.

12:45.130 --> 12:46.793
Way to rip off the bandaid, dude.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.210
So no offense.

12:49.210 --> 12:51.680
But don't you ever get
tired of coming over here

12:51.680 --> 12:53.710
when you could be doing
somethin' cool instead?

12:53.710 --> 12:56.110
I mean it's almost like
you have no life at all.

12:57.070 --> 13:00.120
- Troy, I've got so
much going on right now.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.430
It'd blow your mind.

13:01.430 --> 13:02.830
- Mm-hmm.

13:02.830 --> 13:04.270
What do you do again?

13:04.270 --> 13:08.130
- I'm the associate art director
at Taylor Pharmaceuticals.

13:08.130 --> 13:09.370
- [Troy] What's that mean?

13:09.370 --> 13:12.080
- I create ads for boner pills.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.330
- Oh.

13:13.330 --> 13:14.163
Right.

13:14.163 --> 13:16.360
I see why they chose you.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.110
Havin' a little trouble down there?

13:20.250 --> 13:21.670
- That's low.

13:21.670 --> 13:22.503
- Sorry.

13:23.780 --> 13:24.613
Below the belt?

13:27.360 --> 13:29.090
- You know, you're not
the only junior artist

13:29.090 --> 13:29.940
in need of a mentor.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.300
- I'm just messin' around.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.853
No need to get all sassy.

13:33.870 --> 13:36.630
Hey, did you ever ask that girl out?

13:36.630 --> 13:37.770
- What girl?

13:37.770 --> 13:39.580
- The one from work you told me about.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.680
What's her name again?

13:41.643 --> 13:43.080
- Oh.

13:43.080 --> 13:43.913
Janet.

13:45.385 --> 13:48.552
(soft soothing music)

13:52.697 --> 13:55.948
(Marcus gurgling)

13:55.948 --> 13:59.104
(cereal crunching)

13:59.104 --> 14:02.644
♪ Never was an early riser ♪

14:02.644 --> 14:06.092
♪ Used to be an up-all-nighter ♪

14:06.092 --> 14:11.092

light quite like I do now ♪

14:22.200 --> 14:23.810
- What's up?

14:23.810 --> 14:24.770
- Yo, Pedro.

14:24.770 --> 14:27.290
Nothin' just lowering my IQ.

14:27.290 --> 14:28.123
- I see that.

14:28.123 --> 14:29.210
I see that.

14:29.210 --> 14:30.043
Grab a smoke?

14:31.100 --> 14:31.933
C'mon.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.440
- When do you get work done?

14:36.690 --> 14:38.870
- You know, I would answer that ad.

14:38.870 --> 14:40.440
- Yeah, why don't you
just come live with me?

14:40.440 --> 14:41.343
I keep asking you.

14:41.343 --> 14:43.043
- It's 'cause my roommates get me.

14:44.388 --> 14:45.570
- You live with your parents, Pedro.

14:45.570 --> 14:46.850
- Exactly.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.120
Free rent, free groceries.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.160
They cook for me time-to-time.

14:50.160 --> 14:50.993
It's beautiful.

14:50.993 --> 14:51.826
It's a beautiful thing.

14:51.826 --> 14:53.143
- Yeah, I can't argue with that.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.092
- Whoever that is, I would
say the answer is yes.

14:58.092 --> 15:01.400
(dark foreboding music)
(birds chirping)

15:01.400 --> 15:02.730
- She's lookin' at the flyer.

15:02.730 --> 15:03.930
- Hey, what's she doin'?

15:06.607 --> 15:10.316
(cellphone buzzing)

15:10.316 --> 15:11.149
- She's callin' me, dude.

15:11.149 --> 15:11.982
- Answer it, dude.

15:14.960 --> 15:15.793
- Hi, hello?

15:16.880 --> 15:18.990
- [Mia] Yeah, I'm
calling about the rental,

15:18.990 --> 15:20.140
the one from the flyer.

15:21.090 --> 15:21.923
- Yes.

15:23.530 --> 15:24.863
This is the right number.

15:26.606 --> 15:28.253
- [Mia] Is this near the bus station?

15:30.140 --> 15:30.973
- Yeah.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.090
Maybe a few blocks.

15:32.090 --> 15:32.923
I don't know.

15:32.923 --> 15:34.340
I don't take the bus.

15:34.340 --> 15:35.740
I'm not bragging about that.

15:36.704 --> 15:37.537
I just... I have a car. So.

15:39.430 --> 15:40.680
- When can I come see it?

15:42.040 --> 15:46.040
- [Marcus] I'm actually
not at home right now.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.790
(birds chirping)

15:50.149 --> 15:51.877
- [Mia] Is that you waving at me?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.253
- Yeah.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.670
- That was like phone inception.

16:00.670 --> 16:01.770
- It was weird, right?

16:02.617 --> 16:04.560
Hi, my name's Marcus.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.110
This is my colleague Sam.

16:06.110 --> 16:07.010
We call him Pedro.

16:09.202 --> 16:14.202
(Mia speaking in foreign language)

16:14.220 --> 16:15.880
- So what, you guys
just stand here all day

16:15.880 --> 16:17.690
waiting for somebody to answer your ad?

16:17.690 --> 16:18.840
- No, no, no, just you.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.150
I didn't mean it like that.

16:22.350 --> 16:23.600
We work in this building.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.780
- So I'm just looking
for a place to crash.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.760
It's not longterm or anything.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.940
Hope that's okay.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.593
- I figured you were
asking for someone else.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.833
I mean that's totally cool.

16:39.674 --> 16:41.480
So you wanna rent my room?

16:41.480 --> 16:42.313
- I don't know.

16:42.313 --> 16:43.330
I haven't seen it yet.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.073
- Right.

16:45.073 --> 16:46.670
Of course.

16:46.670 --> 16:49.193
Well I can show you sometime this weekend.

16:50.132 --> 16:51.490
- I was hoping sooner.

16:51.490 --> 16:52.840
- [Marcus] How much sooner?

16:53.820 --> 16:54.653
- Tonight.

16:56.230 --> 16:58.633
- Wow, that's so immediate.

17:01.410 --> 17:02.243
Tonight.

17:02.243 --> 17:04.383
I don't know, I'll have
to check my schedule.

17:07.410 --> 17:09.370
- So do you want me to wait?

17:09.370 --> 17:10.250
- What?

17:10.250 --> 17:13.050
- While you check your schedule,
do you want me to wait?

17:14.350 --> 17:15.183
- Actually

17:16.300 --> 17:17.283
tonight's fine.

17:18.710 --> 17:19.640
Yeah.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.970
Should I just text you the address?

17:21.970 --> 17:22.803
- Six good?

17:24.320 --> 17:25.423
- Yup, sure.

17:27.090 --> 17:28.493
We'll see you then.

17:32.798 --> 17:36.131
(dark foreboding music)

17:37.990 --> 17:38.823
Is it just me

17:38.823 --> 17:40.763
or is there something
very off about that girl?

17:41.860 --> 17:42.693
- Maybe.

17:42.693 --> 17:43.526
She's pretty hot though.

17:43.526 --> 17:46.920
- Yeah, like a murdery kinda way.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.360
Should I actually go through with this?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.660
- Dude, she's like 100 pounds.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.146
What's she gonna do, tie
you up and steal your Xbox?

17:52.146 --> 17:55.479
(dark foreboding music)

17:58.530 --> 17:59.780
- That's not weed, is it?

18:02.095 --> 18:05.428
(dark foreboding music)

18:08.802 --> 18:11.719
(crow cawing)

18:11.719 --> 18:14.886
(skateboard grinding)

18:22.949 --> 18:26.116
(skateboard grinding)

18:29.143 --> 18:32.310
(skateboard grinding)

18:33.172 --> 18:36.505
(dark intriguing music)

18:52.628 --> 18:55.378
(fire crackling)

19:35.606 --> 19:37.981
(crickets chirping)

19:37.981 --> 19:40.981
(soft serene music)

19:43.801 --> 19:46.634
(water trickling)

19:49.289 --> 19:52.289
(crickets chirping)

20:14.593 --> 20:17.176
(Mia knocking)

20:18.120 --> 20:19.053
- Nice flowers.

20:20.300 --> 20:24.040
Did you kill 'em yourself?

20:24.040 --> 20:25.403
- Yeah, sorry about that.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.590
You can feel free to you know,

20:29.590 --> 20:31.270
put your own touches on the space.

20:31.270 --> 20:32.770
- Are those blackout curtains?

20:34.080 --> 20:36.160
- Yeah, I think so.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.763
Is that a problem?

20:38.650 --> 20:40.440
- How much is the rent?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.090
- 650.

20:42.090 --> 20:45.047
That includes-
- I'll take it.

20:45.047 --> 20:46.283
Does that thing work?

20:47.800 --> 20:48.633
- This?

20:48.633 --> 20:49.466
No.

20:51.540 --> 20:52.640
- Tryin' to spy on me?

20:54.880 --> 20:55.713
- Of course not.

20:56.610 --> 20:58.063
It's not even plugged in.

21:01.270 --> 21:02.340
I can take it out if you want.

21:02.340 --> 21:05.083
I'm sorry there's not a TV or anything.

21:10.087 --> 21:11.110
625?

21:11.110 --> 21:12.570
Lotta the stuff in this house

21:12.570 --> 21:14.880
is from my parents' place actually.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.870
Like they just gave it to
me when I bought the place.

21:16.870 --> 21:19.707
And you know, I've been tryin'
to put my own thing on it.

21:19.707 --> 21:21.863
That's from online, you know?

21:22.990 --> 21:26.600
I cleared out the bottom two
shelves in the fridge for you.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.083
If you want these are, you know?

21:29.083 --> 21:29.983
Have at it.

21:32.740 --> 21:36.303
Remind me to get you the wifi password.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.640
There's a private bathroom

21:40.640 --> 21:43.583
you can have all to yourself
down the hallway here.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.993
Gotta say it's a little weird
havin' a roommate again.

21:52.570 --> 21:54.160
- What?

21:54.160 --> 21:56.010
- I said it's a little...

21:57.780 --> 22:00.573
How long do you think
you might wanna stay?

22:02.300 --> 22:03.273
- Not sure yet.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.313
- 'Kay.

22:05.313 --> 22:06.190
You know, we'll play it by ear.

22:08.224 --> 22:10.810
You know, I don't think
I ever got your name.

22:10.810 --> 22:11.643
- It's Mia.

22:13.691 --> 22:14.524
- Mia.

22:16.896 --> 22:17.856
(Mia tapping)

22:17.856 --> 22:21.023
(rhythmic rock music)

22:29.996 --> 22:32.829
(knocks) Hey Mia?

22:33.900 --> 22:34.733
Mia?

22:35.590 --> 22:38.513
There's some food left
over if you want some.

22:42.750 --> 22:46.883
Okay, I'll just leave it
out if you ever want some.

22:47.990 --> 22:49.320
It's

22:49.320 --> 22:50.153
Marcus.

22:52.988 --> 22:54.424
(doorknob clacking)

22:54.424 --> 22:57.757
(dark foreboding music)

23:14.340 --> 23:17.430
- I listen to music
sometimes when I sleep.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.203
So if it never gets too loud, let me know.

23:21.097 --> 23:24.230
- Okay.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.063
Goodnight.

23:29.390 --> 23:31.660
- Jerry, what's goin' on, brother?

23:31.660 --> 23:32.630
Huh, what's poppin'?

23:32.630 --> 23:33.903
Hopefully not them pills.

23:35.420 --> 23:36.253
There he is.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.083
- Hi Pedro.

23:44.270 --> 23:46.170
- So spill the beans.

23:46.170 --> 23:47.320
How's the new roommate?

23:49.834 --> 23:50.834
- I don't know, man.

23:52.970 --> 23:56.620
She's got this weird aura
of sadness about her.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.130
It's haunting.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.640
- Well most girls her age
are a hurricane of emotions.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.420
I'd just give it time.

24:02.420 --> 24:04.156
- I told her a joke the other day.

24:04.156 --> 24:06.812
She just stared at me
for like a full minute

24:06.812 --> 24:08.010
and she was tryin' to
decide whether or not

24:08.010 --> 24:10.000
to stab me in the face.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.223
- Just like deadpan?

24:13.530 --> 24:15.010
That's creepy.

24:15.010 --> 24:16.390
Maybe your joke wasn't funny.

24:16.390 --> 24:17.970
- Oh, it was funny.

24:17.970 --> 24:20.338
It was the one about the
neutron who orders a beer.

24:20.338 --> 24:23.470
- (chuckles) Yeah, "No charge for you."

24:23.470 --> 24:24.530
Yeah, that one's funny.

24:24.530 --> 24:25.363
That one's good.

24:28.530 --> 24:30.930
Maybe and this is out there.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.340
Maybe she's a robot.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.180
Today's technology, very possible.

24:34.180 --> 24:35.220
Artificial intelligence.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.320
She's probably spyin' on you.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.153
Just sayin'.

24:40.869 --> 24:42.119
- I don't know.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.360
There's something in her eyes.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.240
Something

24:47.280 --> 24:48.183
violent.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.890
I don't think the girl's ever
smiled a day in her life.

24:52.890 --> 24:54.390
- That's it.

24:54.390 --> 24:56.310
Personal challenge.

24:56.310 --> 24:57.750
Make her smile.

24:57.750 --> 24:58.583
It's beautiful.

24:59.950 --> 25:01.900
- Is that really the job of a landlord?

25:02.740 --> 25:04.490
I mean I'm pretty sure my only job

25:04.490 --> 25:07.870
is to make sure she has a
nice, safe space to live

25:07.870 --> 25:11.180
while pretending she's
not insanely attractive.

25:11.180 --> 25:12.330
- Yeah, she's sizzlin'.

25:13.777 --> 25:15.940
And you live with her, I couldn't do that.

25:15.940 --> 25:17.410
That's tough.

25:17.410 --> 25:20.570
- Yeah, but her shitty
attitude makes it easier.

25:20.570 --> 25:22.000
God, I've had crazy roommates before.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.020
But this girl's like next level.

25:24.020 --> 25:24.853
- Stage five?

25:25.720 --> 25:27.110
Well bright side is

25:27.110 --> 25:29.160
she hasn't tried to stab you in the face.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.910
- Yet.

25:31.910 --> 25:33.950
Yeah, of course I'm coming.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.400
I haven't seen you and
dad since what, like June?

25:39.817 --> 25:42.295
Did my roommate leave my door open?

25:42.295 --> 25:45.840
(dark foreboding music)

25:45.840 --> 25:47.140
Lemme call you right back.

25:52.438 --> 25:53.271
Mia?

25:59.090 --> 25:59.923
Mia.

26:09.130 --> 26:09.963
Hello?

26:13.840 --> 26:16.673
(Marcus knocking)

26:31.660 --> 26:33.890
- [Announcer] Enter Peaches
all-American sweepstakes

26:33.890 --> 26:36.191
with a grocery purchase of $50 or more.

26:36.191 --> 26:39.181
(soft foreboding music)

26:39.181 --> 26:40.741
Call now for automatic entry.

26:40.741 --> 26:42.420
Only first 50 callers eligible.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.010
- Hey Mia, did you?

26:44.010 --> 26:46.560
Oh my god, are you okay?

26:46.560 --> 26:47.560
Is that blood?

26:47.560 --> 26:49.050
Mia.

26:49.050 --> 26:51.350
Do I need to call 9-1-1 or something?

26:51.350 --> 26:53.143
- [Announcer] No relatives of Peaches.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.350
- [Troy] Wait, you really think
this girl's a drug pusher?

26:57.350 --> 27:00.970
I am 99% sure she's
selling crack cocaine, yes.

27:00.970 --> 27:02.490
- What makes you so sure?

27:02.490 --> 27:03.720
- Well for starters,

27:03.720 --> 27:07.010
she goes out every single
night with this backpack.

27:07.010 --> 27:10.000
Like not a purse, an actual backpack.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.070
And then every time she comes home,

27:12.070 --> 27:14.260
she's completely strung out.

27:14.260 --> 27:17.610
The other day, she fell
down upon coming in the door

27:17.610 --> 27:19.870
and I'm pretty sure she had blood on her.

27:19.870 --> 27:22.000
Like actual blood, real blood.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.300
Oh and get this: her part of
the fridge is completely empty.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.860
She's has never had anything in it

27:26.860 --> 27:28.710
and I've never seen her eat anything.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.800
Isn't that suspicious?

27:30.800 --> 27:31.863
- Maybe she eats out.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.449
- Maybe.

27:34.449 --> 27:36.010
- If she's dangerous,
just give her the boot.

27:36.010 --> 27:37.063
It's your house.

27:38.070 --> 27:41.050
- Troy, you can't just kick
somebody out without proof.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.920
That's why I need to get video
of her sellin' the hooch.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.103
- Hooch is moonshine.

27:46.520 --> 27:47.580
- Smack?
- Watch your flank.

27:47.580 --> 27:48.831
Watch your flank.

27:48.831 --> 27:49.664
(explosion bursting)
(soldier screaming)

27:49.664 --> 27:50.497
- Oh, that was close.

27:50.497 --> 27:51.980
- You're just being paranoid.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.880
I seriously doubt a girl like
that would be pushing smack.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.710
- Maybe, I guess.

27:57.710 --> 28:00.053
- You know, she's probably a prostitute.

28:02.610 --> 28:04.293
- You know, I never thought of that.

28:06.006 --> 28:08.100
Huh, how would I find out?

28:08.100 --> 28:08.933
- Perfume.

28:08.933 --> 28:10.193
They always load it on.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.070
- Troy, it concerns me

28:13.070 --> 28:14.797
how much you know about this subject.

28:14.797 --> 28:16.210
I think I'm failing as a big brother.

28:16.210 --> 28:18.623
- No, I just watch a lotta TV.

28:18.623 --> 28:20.924
(gun blasting)
(explosions bursting)

28:20.924 --> 28:24.540
(television chattering)

28:24.540 --> 28:27.779
- [Actor] We're just searching
for different things.

28:27.779 --> 28:29.460
- Hey, you want a fry?

28:29.460 --> 28:30.293
- No, thanks.

28:30.293 --> 28:31.126
- Hey,

28:32.060 --> 28:34.060
is that Chanel you're wearing?

28:34.060 --> 28:35.365
- What?

28:35.365 --> 28:36.198
- Perfume.

28:37.166 --> 28:39.640
You just smell kinda nice.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.853
(door banging)

28:40.853 --> 28:42.200
- [Actor] And I see it
in my children's eyes

28:42.200 --> 28:43.909
every day when I wake up.

28:43.909 --> 28:47.516
(dark intriguing music)

28:47.516 --> 28:50.516
(crickets chirping)

29:03.174 --> 29:05.757
(Mia knocking)

29:16.345 --> 29:19.678
(dark intriguing music)

29:40.076 --> 29:42.909
- (gasps) Oh gee.

29:44.836 --> 29:46.003
What the hell?

29:51.671 --> 29:52.754
See, I don't.

29:57.679 --> 29:59.662
What are you doing, Mia?

29:59.662 --> 30:02.995
(dark intriguing music)

30:09.948 --> 30:13.489
(crickets chirping)

30:13.489 --> 30:16.072
- Hey, lookie what we got here.

30:17.207 --> 30:18.040
Goin' the wrong direction.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.190
My place is this way.

30:19.190 --> 30:20.160
- Doin' all right?
- Hey princess,

30:20.160 --> 30:20.993
where you goin'?

30:20.993 --> 30:22.427
- Wanna get a little tied up tonight?

30:23.432 --> 30:25.135
- Hey, we're talkin' to you.

30:25.135 --> 30:30.135
(dark foreboding music)
(crickets chirping)

30:34.586 --> 30:36.617
- Guys, let's get outta here.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.770
C'mon, let's roll out.

30:38.770 --> 30:39.850
- Should smile more.

30:39.850 --> 30:41.044
- [Leader] Let's go.

30:41.044 --> 30:46.044
(dark foreboding music)
(crickets chirping)

31:08.748 --> 31:11.665
(coffee trickling)

31:20.577 --> 31:23.494
(cereal crunching)

31:25.720 --> 31:26.893
- Um, hello.

31:28.330 --> 31:29.163
- Hey.

31:36.556 --> 31:39.139
(Mia slurping)

31:40.640 --> 31:42.280
Rough night?

31:42.280 --> 31:43.450
- No, nope.

31:43.450 --> 31:44.896
Just

31:44.896 --> 31:46.300
you know,

31:46.300 --> 31:47.813
the usual.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.205
(water trickling)

31:58.205 --> 31:59.038
- So

32:00.980 --> 32:01.813
last night,

32:03.510 --> 32:04.503
did you follow me?

32:05.350 --> 32:06.183
- What?

32:07.510 --> 32:09.893
- Last night, you followed me.

32:12.470 --> 32:13.303
I'm not mad.

32:13.303 --> 32:15.723
I just wanna know why.

32:16.670 --> 32:17.860
- No, no.

32:17.860 --> 32:21.470
I don't know where you got that idea.

32:21.470 --> 32:22.773
I was here all night.

32:26.690 --> 32:28.630
Okay, honestly.

32:28.630 --> 32:31.060
Yeah, I followed you.

32:31.060 --> 32:33.260
I mean really, I was
just worried about you.

32:33.260 --> 32:35.200
I mean haven't you been watching the news?

32:35.200 --> 32:38.660
It's not safe for pretty
girls to walk around.

32:38.660 --> 32:40.160
I didn't mean that.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.410
It's not that you're not.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.083
It's not safe to walk around at night.

32:48.260 --> 32:51.260
I mean if something happened
to you, I'd be out 650 a month.

32:54.960 --> 32:55.793
- I see.

32:57.853 --> 32:59.113
- Mia, wait.

33:02.213 --> 33:03.046
I followed you

33:03.046 --> 33:06.343
'cause I wanted to see if
you were selling drugs.

33:07.350 --> 33:08.183
I'm sorry.

33:08.183 --> 33:09.016
I needed to know.

33:11.100 --> 33:13.030
- So what did you see?

33:13.030 --> 33:17.900
- I saw a very nice-looking
person come to the door

33:17.900 --> 33:19.720
and then I saw you both go inside.

33:19.720 --> 33:22.620
And it definitely didn't look
like they were buying crack.

33:23.750 --> 33:24.583
I left.

33:26.570 --> 33:27.403
- Is that all?

33:27.403 --> 33:29.060
You didn't see anything else?

33:29.060 --> 33:29.893
- Mm-mmm.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.070
- I wasn't selling crack to that woman.

33:35.230 --> 33:36.810
- Okay.

33:36.810 --> 33:37.703
Good to know.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.623
You ever killed anybody?

33:43.630 --> 33:44.680
- You mean this week?

33:49.120 --> 33:49.953
- All right.

33:49.953 --> 33:51.280
Sorry for all the paranoia.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.840
- So we're good here?

33:53.840 --> 33:55.490
You don't want me to leave?

33:55.490 --> 33:56.583
- No, don't be crazy.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.360
Not you, I didn't mean.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.600
You're not crazy

34:00.600 --> 34:03.673
just the thing that you just said.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.895
- Are you sure nobody
followed you last night?

34:08.895 --> 34:11.500
(dark foreboding music)

34:11.500 --> 34:12.670
- Yeah.

34:12.670 --> 34:14.180
Pretty sure.

34:14.180 --> 34:16.620
Why, are you on the run or something?

34:16.620 --> 34:17.453
- Aren't we all?

34:19.385 --> 34:20.385
I'm hittin' the sack

34:23.060 --> 34:24.203
- At nine in the morning?

34:24.203 --> 34:25.036
'Course you are.

34:27.801 --> 34:29.237
- Is that all you got?

34:29.237 --> 34:30.070
Is that all you got?

34:30.070 --> 34:30.903
- Yeah, maybe.

34:30.903 --> 34:31.736
No, no. That's not all I got.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.280
- This is not safe.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.321
- I'll show you.

34:34.321 --> 34:35.829
(soft cheerful music)
(wheelchair rattling)

34:35.829 --> 34:36.662
(Troy chuckling)

34:36.662 --> 34:38.712
So why you gotta doubt me like that, huh?

34:41.570 --> 34:43.960
- Hey, can I ask you a guy question?

34:43.960 --> 34:45.360
- Yeah, I suppose I qualify.

34:46.620 --> 34:47.533
- Nah, forget it.

34:51.181 --> 34:52.281
- No, what's goin' on?

34:53.670 --> 34:55.313
- 'Kay, but it's embarrassing.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.293
- What's up?

34:58.940 --> 35:02.040
- So there's this one girl at school

35:02.040 --> 35:04.430
who talks to me sometimes

35:04.430 --> 35:05.730
and I'm sorta into her, you know?

35:05.730 --> 35:06.563
But

35:07.620 --> 35:10.313
I don't know if she's just
being nice or whatever.

35:11.270 --> 35:12.320
She probably is.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.240
You know how girls are.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.073
- Yeah.

35:16.330 --> 35:17.590
- I don't know.

35:17.590 --> 35:21.470
I just want her to see me
as a regular guy, you know?

35:21.470 --> 35:23.060
Which isn't easy.

35:23.060 --> 35:25.610
- Well here's something that always works

35:25.610 --> 35:26.740
and it's super simple.

35:26.740 --> 35:28.903
You're gonna get a lotta
mileage outta this though.

35:29.810 --> 35:31.340
Just gotta make her laugh.

35:31.340 --> 35:32.800
- So just be funny?

35:32.800 --> 35:34.747
I'm already hysterical.

35:34.747 --> 35:38.540
- (chuckles) That and never be rude

35:40.070 --> 35:43.290
and don't make her think
that you like her too much.

35:43.290 --> 35:44.430
She'll hate that.

35:44.430 --> 35:47.625
Just always gotta keep
an element of mystery.

35:47.625 --> 35:48.458
- Mystery.

35:49.980 --> 35:51.093
I can do mystery.

35:52.330 --> 35:55.000
Hey, I was thinkin'
about your weird roommate

35:55.000 --> 35:56.140
the other night.

35:56.140 --> 35:57.260
- Speaking of mystery.

35:57.260 --> 35:58.260
Yeah, go ahead.

35:58.260 --> 35:59.270
- You know, honestly,

35:59.270 --> 36:01.920
I'm surprised it took me
this long to figure it out.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.723
I mean this one's super obvious.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.430
- Okay, can't wait to hear this one.

36:08.290 --> 36:09.980
- It's my professional opinion

36:12.850 --> 36:14.202
that she's a Shadowlurker.

36:14.202 --> 36:16.730
(crow cawing)

36:16.730 --> 36:18.307
- She's a Shadowlurker.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.743
So she's the one that's been
going around torching people.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.313
Oh crap, dude.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.480
I left some matches on
the table this morning.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.960
How many people do you think she's killed?

36:30.960 --> 36:32.960
- Well they don't usually burn people.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.210
I mean most of them like to
you know, sneak up on you

36:36.210 --> 36:37.867
and use a knife or somethin'.

36:38.810 --> 36:39.643
- Fantastic.

36:41.338 --> 36:44.080
- You know, should really look into this

36:45.118 --> 36:47.000
before it's too late.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.290
- Okay, Troy.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.119
I totally will.

36:50.119 --> 36:51.463
I'm gonna look into it.

36:53.260 --> 36:56.593
(soft intriguing music)

37:01.239 --> 37:03.790
"According to legend, the
Fellowship of the Fallen

37:03.790 --> 37:05.700
began in the ancient city of Salem

37:05.700 --> 37:08.010
where Lord Tenebris and his assassins

37:08.010 --> 37:11.780
overthrew an oppressive
king and executed him

37:11.780 --> 37:13.603
along with most of his subjects.

37:14.620 --> 37:16.810
They later fled Salem for unknown reasons

37:16.810 --> 37:18.770
and became known as Shadowlurkers

37:18.770 --> 37:20.947
due to their nature of intense secrecy."

37:22.060 --> 37:24.643
(door banging)

37:33.010 --> 37:34.826
Intense secrecy? Check.

37:34.826 --> 37:38.159
(soft intriguing music)

37:39.350 --> 37:40.183
All right.

37:40.183 --> 37:42.620
'Kay, this is where it
gets really crazy, 'kay?

37:42.620 --> 37:45.100
So they refer to this dude
as the magic king, right?

37:45.100 --> 37:47.350
So before the fellowship took over,

37:47.350 --> 37:49.740
apparently he put all
of his remaining power

37:49.740 --> 37:52.000
into these lanterns and
sent them out in secret

37:52.000 --> 37:54.280
and then they became
known as Salem's light.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.710
- What if one of those
lights is still out there?

37:55.710 --> 37:56.543
- Mm-hmm.

37:56.543 --> 37:58.620
But somebody keeps deleting
all these websites.

37:58.620 --> 38:01.420
Like every time I get a good
hit, it's gone in 24 hours.

38:03.260 --> 38:05.740
- Wait, so why would an
evil king share his power,

38:05.740 --> 38:08.670
and pardon my French, share
with a bunch of a-holes anyways?

38:08.670 --> 38:09.660
- That's the thing.

38:09.660 --> 38:11.470
It's like the bad guys are
tellin' the whole story.

38:11.470 --> 38:12.870
It's a legitimate conspiracy

38:15.430 --> 38:18.453
- Or it's just a bunch of
kids trolling on the internet.

38:24.650 --> 38:25.483
What's up?

38:29.280 --> 38:30.210
You see that?

38:30.210 --> 38:31.360
She's warmin' up to me.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.940
- Clearly.

38:33.940 --> 38:34.866
- All right, let's bring it back.

38:34.866 --> 38:35.699
Let's bring it back.

38:35.699 --> 38:37.760
So do you actually believe this stuff?

38:37.760 --> 38:38.760
- No, of course not.

38:39.670 --> 38:41.290
But Troy's got all this stuff in my head

38:41.290 --> 38:44.150
and then with all this
copycat killing and...

38:44.150 --> 38:45.400
I don't know, it's weird.

38:52.620 --> 38:53.920
- You said that Mia carries a backpack

38:53.920 --> 38:54.950
everywhere she goes, right?

38:54.950 --> 38:55.783
- Mm-hmm.

38:57.320 --> 38:59.123
- So what if maybe,

39:00.380 --> 39:03.853
maybe you happen to accidentally just

39:03.853 --> 39:05.610
(whistles) take a little peek?

39:05.610 --> 39:06.443
- [Marcus] No.

39:06.443 --> 39:07.276
- Just a little sneaky peak.

39:07.276 --> 39:08.109
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

39:08.109 --> 39:09.220
That's an invasion of privacy.

39:09.220 --> 39:10.690
- Is it?

39:10.690 --> 39:11.523
- Yeah.

39:11.523 --> 39:12.900
- Here me out.

39:12.900 --> 39:15.020
Backpack out in the open.

39:15.020 --> 39:15.853
- No.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.060
- Zipper's open as well.

39:17.060 --> 39:18.960
Oops, I bumped into it.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.870
Scatters all over the floor.

39:20.870 --> 39:22.430
- Not gonna do it.
- Lemme help you pick that up.

39:22.430 --> 39:23.263
- No.
- Ooh.

39:23.263 --> 39:24.470
Now I'm seein' everything she's got.

39:24.470 --> 39:25.303
- I can't.

39:25.303 --> 39:27.060
We have a relationship based on trust.

39:27.060 --> 39:27.893
- Do you?

39:29.350 --> 39:30.660
- No, not at all actually.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.070
I don't trust her as far as I
can throw her, but we should.

39:33.070 --> 39:33.903
She's my tenant.

39:33.903 --> 39:35.130
- [Pedro] Well then lemme do it.

39:35.130 --> 39:36.679
- No.

39:36.679 --> 39:37.512
- Damn.

39:41.623 --> 39:45.027
(Marcus breathing heavily)

39:45.027 --> 39:47.195
(shower trickling)

39:47.195 --> 39:50.528
(soft intriguing music)

40:30.737 --> 40:34.070
(dark foreboding music)

40:46.324 --> 40:49.252
(bag thudding)
(door slamming)

40:49.252 --> 40:50.085
- Oh shit.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.970
- Dropped somethin'.

41:05.970 --> 41:07.853
Think you dropped your wallet there.

41:09.439 --> 41:11.560
Might wanna hang on to that.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.423
- Wow, thank you.

41:14.550 --> 41:16.090
Shallow pockets, I guess.

41:16.090 --> 41:17.149
- Mm-hmm.

41:17.149 --> 41:18.883
What kinda mileage you get in that thing?

41:20.610 --> 41:21.443
- Mileage?

41:23.020 --> 41:23.853
I don't know.

41:23.853 --> 41:24.993
Fine, I guess.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.190
- Well make sure you
keep those doors locked.

41:29.190 --> 41:32.435
There's a lotta assholes
runnin' around causin' trouble.

41:32.435 --> 41:34.664
(soft foreboding music)

41:34.664 --> 41:35.980
- I do.

41:35.980 --> 41:37.630
- Hell, you been watchin' the news?

41:39.120 --> 41:41.070
They found another body few blocks over

41:42.220 --> 41:43.320
all burnt up and shit.

41:45.980 --> 41:47.366
Whatever happened to the basics?

41:47.366 --> 41:49.460
(soft foreboding music)
(knife clacking)

41:49.460 --> 41:50.453
Cut and go.

41:51.660 --> 41:53.260
Nobody even knew you were there.

41:55.460 --> 41:58.009
Guess these things are
too old fashioned now.

41:58.009 --> 42:03.009
(soft foreboding music)
(birds chirping)

42:06.290 --> 42:07.840
- Do I know you?

42:07.840 --> 42:09.943
Sorry, you just look oddly familiar.

42:14.060 --> 42:14.910
- Well let's see.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.313
You know Reggie, right?

42:18.350 --> 42:20.770
Lives up on Highland Avenue.

42:20.770 --> 42:23.990
- No, I'm afraid I don't know Reggie.

42:23.990 --> 42:25.550
- Huh.

42:25.550 --> 42:26.830
Well let's see.

42:26.830 --> 42:28.130
- Thank you for the wallet.

42:28.130 --> 42:29.230
Appreciate it.

42:29.230 --> 42:30.551
- How about ole Mia?

42:30.551 --> 42:34.040
(dark foreboding music)
(birds chirping)

42:34.040 --> 42:35.290
D'you know her?

42:40.559 --> 42:43.240
You know, it takes a lotta trust

42:43.240 --> 42:45.740
to let a stranger into your house.

42:45.740 --> 42:46.790
Not that I blame you.

42:49.060 --> 42:51.210
I mean

42:51.210 --> 42:52.293
she's real easy to look at.

42:56.780 --> 42:58.407
Keep those doors locked.

42:58.407 --> 43:01.740
(dark foreboding music)

43:05.613 --> 43:07.991
(alarm beeping)

43:07.991 --> 43:11.074
(workers chattering)

43:21.830 --> 43:24.590
- Hey Marcus, you okay?

43:24.590 --> 43:26.180
- Yeah.

43:26.180 --> 43:27.060
Yeah, I'm fine.

43:27.060 --> 43:27.893
Why?

43:27.893 --> 43:29.743
- Well you look a little
tired, that's all.

43:30.990 --> 43:33.090
- Just didn't get that
much sleep last night.

43:33.090 --> 43:34.320
It was kind of a long night.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.360
- Oh, well I hope whatever her name is,

43:36.360 --> 43:38.380
you give her a little rest
every now and then, huh?

43:38.380 --> 43:40.117
(vocalizes) Huh?

43:40.117 --> 43:43.200
(workers chattering)

43:47.840 --> 43:49.482
- Yeah, that wasn't
massively inappropriate.

43:49.482 --> 43:51.382
(intriguing rock music)

43:51.382 --> 43:53.293
- (knocks) Mia.

43:55.840 --> 43:58.323
Mia, can you open the door please?

43:59.202 --> 44:01.883
(knocks) I'm coming in.

44:05.890 --> 44:06.723
Mia.

44:08.260 --> 44:09.093
We need to talk.

44:10.210 --> 44:11.043
- Okay.

44:13.460 --> 44:15.830
- I think it's best that you leave.

44:15.830 --> 44:17.398
- Oh, do you need some
privacy or something?

44:17.398 --> 44:18.231
- No.

44:18.231 --> 44:19.670
I mean I think

44:19.670 --> 44:22.240
it'd be better if you found
another place to stay.

44:22.240 --> 44:23.073
I'm sorry.

44:23.073 --> 44:24.490
It's nothing personal.

44:24.490 --> 44:25.540
It's not working out.

44:26.540 --> 44:27.440
- Is it the music?

44:27.440 --> 44:28.610
I had headphones, but they-

44:28.610 --> 44:30.280
- No, listen.

44:30.280 --> 44:34.000
I don't care about whatever
weird scene you're into,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.463
but it's actually starting
to affect my life now.

44:37.460 --> 44:39.180
- I don't really know
what you're tryin' to say.

44:39.180 --> 44:40.650
And why are you yelling at me?

44:40.650 --> 44:42.030
- Because ever since you showed up,

44:42.030 --> 44:44.510
my life has gotten increasingly bizarre

44:44.510 --> 44:48.000
And now your crazy I
don't know ex or something

44:48.000 --> 44:49.180
just showed up and threatened me.

44:49.180 --> 44:50.013
- My what?

44:51.020 --> 44:52.980
- Sorry, I'm done, okay?

44:52.980 --> 44:54.620
This is too much.

44:54.620 --> 44:56.590
- I really don't understand
what you're tryin' to tell me.

44:56.590 --> 44:58.830
- Look, just tell me the truth.

44:58.830 --> 44:59.880
Are you selling drugs?

44:59.880 --> 45:00.810
If you're not selling drugs,

45:00.810 --> 45:02.570
then why are you going into
all these neighborhoods

45:02.570 --> 45:03.403
every night?

45:03.403 --> 45:04.440
- That's my personal business.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.840
- No, not anymore.

45:05.840 --> 45:08.323
I don't feel safe with you in my home.

45:08.323 --> 45:11.490
(rhythmic rock music)

45:12.500 --> 45:13.733
Why all the secrecy?

45:15.600 --> 45:16.643
- Hard to explain.

45:17.730 --> 45:19.730
- Then I'm sorry, but you have to leave.

45:19.730 --> 45:20.653
- Marcus, please.

45:22.930 --> 45:24.870
- Don't you have friends, anyone,

45:24.870 --> 45:27.063
other than some guy you barely know?

45:28.570 --> 45:31.020
- Well, my friends all wanna kill me.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.433
- Yeah, well I can see why.

45:34.550 --> 45:36.143
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

45:40.213 --> 45:41.387
You really not have anybody?

45:41.387 --> 45:44.554
(rhythmic rock music)

45:49.230 --> 45:50.693
I'm sorry I yelled at you,

45:52.180 --> 45:55.300
but I need some answers, Mia.

45:55.300 --> 45:56.410
Are you in trouble?

45:56.410 --> 45:58.380
I'll take you to a crisis
center or something

45:58.380 --> 45:59.490
if you're in trouble.

45:59.490 --> 46:00.323
Don't worry about the rent.

46:00.323 --> 46:02.580
- You really wanna know
where I go at night?

46:02.580 --> 46:05.543
Tomorrow night you can come
with me and then you'll see.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.590
- That or you can just tell me

46:10.450 --> 46:12.713
- No, it's better if you see.

46:15.740 --> 46:16.573
- Okay.

46:18.533 --> 46:19.366
All right.

46:21.070 --> 46:21.903
Well

46:23.810 --> 46:24.643
goodnight.

46:26.003 --> 46:28.810
(workers chattering)

46:28.810 --> 46:30.060
Think I'm gonna throw up.

46:31.410 --> 46:33.040
- Deep breaths.

46:33.040 --> 46:33.873
C'mon, lemme hear one.

46:33.873 --> 46:35.460
Inhale.

46:35.460 --> 46:37.066
Inhale, exhale.

46:37.066 --> 46:38.160
(Marcus exhaling)

46:38.160 --> 46:40.390
Here's the situation at hand:

46:40.390 --> 46:43.020
you've been wanting to find
out where she's been going

46:43.020 --> 46:45.080
and now she's giving you that opportunity.

46:45.080 --> 46:48.240
- Yeah, but I don't wanna die either.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.120
I mean maybe she's planning
an ambush or something.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.153
- Yeah, I could totally
see that happening.

46:53.470 --> 46:55.550
- Thank you for your
words of encouragement.

46:55.550 --> 46:56.383
- Anytime.

46:57.910 --> 47:00.160
I could always come
along and hold your hand.

47:01.820 --> 47:03.100
- I'm gonna end up tied to a light pole

47:03.100 --> 47:05.200
and you're gonna feel bad
about making that comment.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.260
- Not if you manifested it first.

47:07.260 --> 47:09.264
So how about you just relax, calm down?

47:09.264 --> 47:11.210
Because you're bringin' a
lotta negativity into the zone

47:11.210 --> 47:12.043
and I'm not feelin' it.

47:12.043 --> 47:12.876
I can't do that today.

47:12.876 --> 47:13.709
- You came into my zone.

47:13.709 --> 47:15.040
I was here first.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.623
And this isn't negativity,
I'm scared, okay?

47:19.976 --> 47:20.920
And I don't know why I'm scared.

47:20.920 --> 47:22.560
I don't know why I'm more scared now

47:22.560 --> 47:24.880
than when I thought she was a drug dealer.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.623
- The fear of the unknown
is a scary place to live.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.497
Also it sounds like you
have feelings for her.

47:32.550 --> 47:33.530
- What?

47:33.530 --> 47:34.680
No.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.913
- And if you didn't like
her, you wouldn't care.

47:38.380 --> 47:39.690
- Shut up.

47:39.690 --> 47:40.963
She's my roommate.

47:41.890 --> 47:43.240
- That was very convincing.

47:44.700 --> 47:46.240
Should probably go to
the bathroom, calm down,

47:46.240 --> 47:48.270
splash water on your face.

47:48.270 --> 47:49.103
- No.

47:49.103 --> 47:50.540
(soft serene music)

47:50.540 --> 47:51.373
- Poor guy.

48:12.210 --> 48:14.270
- [Reporter] The embellishment
charges would be dropped.

48:14.270 --> 48:17.600
In other news, police are on
the lookout for three suspects

48:17.600 --> 48:19.390
in a recent murder of a homeless man

48:19.390 --> 48:22.190
who had been tied to a light
pole on Division Street

48:22.190 --> 48:23.370
and set on fire.

48:23.370 --> 48:26.840
If you live in or near
the area of Estes Hill,

48:26.840 --> 48:30.070
authorities are urging you
to take extreme caution

48:30.070 --> 48:32.244
when traveling after nightfall.

48:32.244 --> 48:35.577
(soft intriguing music)

48:45.380 --> 48:46.280
- [Mia] You ready?

48:48.750 --> 48:49.583
- Yup.

48:51.100 --> 48:53.637
- You know, you really
don't have to do this.

48:56.993 --> 48:58.093
- No, I'm good.

48:59.490 --> 49:00.700
Cool.

49:00.700 --> 49:01.840
Let's go.

49:01.840 --> 49:05.173
(soft intriguing music)

49:25.680 --> 49:28.020
So you're sure that this is the right one?

49:28.020 --> 49:29.360
- Yeah, why?

49:29.360 --> 49:33.000
- Do you mind kinda tellin' me
what we're getting into here?

49:33.000 --> 49:33.870
Who are these people?

49:33.870 --> 49:34.703
Do you know them?

49:34.703 --> 49:35.750
Are they friends of yours?

49:35.750 --> 49:36.990
- Neither of those things.

49:36.990 --> 49:37.823
- Mia.

49:40.090 --> 49:41.650
- You really don't have to do this.

49:41.650 --> 49:42.483
- I kinda do.

49:42.483 --> 49:43.316
I'm here now.

49:43.316 --> 49:44.823
I might as well come with you.

49:45.870 --> 49:47.203
I know, I know.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.240
You're in AA, aren't you?

49:50.240 --> 49:51.960
And this is a step when you go around

49:51.960 --> 49:54.070
apologizing to everyone
that you treated poorly

49:54.070 --> 49:55.820
when you were drunk, is that right?

49:56.810 --> 49:57.643
- Nope.

49:59.830 --> 50:03.112
- Okay, do you have any
idea how long this'll take?

50:03.112 --> 50:03.945
- I don't know.

50:03.945 --> 50:05.860
But Marcus, can you
please not say anything?

50:05.860 --> 50:07.260
You're just here to observe.

50:08.220 --> 50:09.700
- Yeah, okay.

50:09.700 --> 50:10.723
Observe, got it.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.480
- Oh and if anything crazy
happens, just run to the car.

50:15.480 --> 50:17.590
I'll find my way back home.

50:17.590 --> 50:18.830
- Wait, what?

50:18.830 --> 50:23.830
(crickets chirping)
(Mia knocking)

50:23.920 --> 50:25.333
Doesn't look like anybody's home.

50:27.167 --> 50:31.807
(crickets chirping)
(door squeaking)

50:31.807 --> 50:33.860
- Can I help you guys?

50:33.860 --> 50:35.440
- Yes.

50:35.440 --> 50:38.740
My name is Mia and this is Marcus,

50:38.740 --> 50:40.280
my

50:40.280 --> 50:41.113
landlord.

50:43.860 --> 50:47.113
This is gonna sound strange,
but I'm here to see Autumn.

50:50.070 --> 50:52.120
- Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.

50:53.070 --> 50:53.903
It's late.

50:54.760 --> 50:55.893
- I knew her father.

50:57.210 --> 50:58.860
Please, it'll just take a minute.

51:00.658 --> 51:05.658
- All right.

51:06.276 --> 51:07.380
Hun?

51:07.380 --> 51:09.230
Hun, could you come down here please?

51:10.830 --> 51:11.663
Hun?

51:12.990 --> 51:14.440
She'll down in just a minute.

51:17.469 --> 51:19.265
Hun!

51:19.265 --> 51:20.098
- Coming.

51:24.342 --> 51:25.175
(dark foreboding music)

51:25.175 --> 51:26.008
What is this?

51:27.000 --> 51:28.830
Why'd you let her in?

51:28.830 --> 51:30.480
- She said she knew your brother.

51:31.420 --> 51:32.780
- I'm sorry it's so late,

51:32.780 --> 51:36.290
but I would like to
see her if that's okay.

51:36.290 --> 51:37.800
- Why are you here?

51:37.800 --> 51:39.663
Why are you in our home?

51:42.270 --> 51:44.141
I know who you are.

51:44.141 --> 51:47.410
(dark foreboding music)

51:47.410 --> 51:48.910
- I'm not here to hurt anyone.

51:49.830 --> 51:51.490
I promise.

51:51.490 --> 51:53.067
- We don't want any
trouble from you people

51:53.067 --> 51:55.060
and the neighbors will hear me if I shout.

51:55.060 --> 51:56.363
- No, no. I'm alone.

51:57.230 --> 52:00.210
They're not with me and
that's not why I'm here.

52:00.210 --> 52:02.203
- Why are you here?

52:03.610 --> 52:05.037
- I'm here for Autumn.

52:05.037 --> 52:08.370
(dark foreboding music)

52:09.210 --> 52:11.490
- You're not takin' that girl.

52:11.490 --> 52:12.993
- I didn't come to take her.

52:14.630 --> 52:16.130
I came to help.

52:16.130 --> 52:16.963
- You're lying.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.350
- If I were lying,
would I be wearing this?

52:26.940 --> 52:27.933
How bad is it?

52:30.313 --> 52:33.313
(soft somber music)

52:34.270 --> 52:35.103
Hey.

52:35.970 --> 52:37.720
Not feeling too good?

52:37.720 --> 52:38.920
- She has a heart condition.

52:38.920 --> 52:39.753
Be careful.

52:43.970 --> 52:45.620
- My name is Mia.

52:45.620 --> 52:46.607
What's your name?

52:46.607 --> 52:47.710
- Autumn.

52:47.710 --> 52:49.513
- Autumn, that's such a pretty name.

52:52.870 --> 52:55.083
Autumn, can I tell you a bedtime story?

52:56.040 --> 52:57.700
Yeah.

52:57.700 --> 53:02.700
There was once a little girl
who had no family to love her.

53:03.090 --> 53:06.040
All she ever wanted was to find
a place where she belonged.

53:07.230 --> 53:10.830
Then after a few years,
this really nice couple

53:11.870 --> 53:13.820
told her that she could stay with them.

53:14.680 --> 53:18.003
They taught her how to play
chess and how to ride a bike.

53:18.870 --> 53:20.323
She was so happy.

53:22.200 --> 53:24.193
But that didn't last for very long.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.850
You see, these really

53:28.050 --> 53:32.940
bad people came and told her
that they were her new family

53:34.162 --> 53:35.670
and that they were going to protect her

53:35.670 --> 53:38.053
and love her forever.

53:39.120 --> 53:43.543
They got her all kinds of gifts
and dazzled her with magic.

53:45.530 --> 53:48.030
Pretty soon, she forgot
all about the nice couple.

53:50.090 --> 53:52.370
You see, her family was so amazing

53:53.640 --> 53:55.740
that they fooled her into using the magic

53:55.740 --> 53:57.450
that they had taught her.

53:57.450 --> 54:00.830
When she got old enough, she
realized how bad they were.

54:00.830 --> 54:02.380
She ran away.

54:02.380 --> 54:03.213
But guess what?

54:04.620 --> 54:09.620
She found a beautiful, safe
castle with a really nice owner.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.643
She even brought her magic with her.

54:12.643 --> 54:15.643
(soft serene music)

54:20.901 --> 54:24.068
Autumn, can you trust me for a minute?

54:30.580 --> 54:34.163
(Autumn breathing heavily)

54:43.843 --> 54:44.914
- Autumn?

54:44.914 --> 54:47.663
- I feel so much better.

54:47.663 --> 54:50.663
(soft serene music)

55:17.558 --> 55:18.930
(crickets chirping)

55:18.930 --> 55:20.580
- So

55:22.550 --> 55:24.753
this is what you've been
doing every night, huh?

55:27.260 --> 55:28.093
- Disappointed?

55:29.900 --> 55:30.733
- No.

55:31.970 --> 55:33.660
Although now I kinda wish
you were a drug dealer

55:33.660 --> 55:35.935
and then I could ask for some Xanax.

55:35.935 --> 55:38.935
(crickets chirping)

55:40.160 --> 55:41.950
You really don't look that great.

55:41.950 --> 55:42.783
Are you okay?

55:44.040 --> 55:44.890
- [Mia] I'm fine.

55:47.160 --> 55:48.943
- How do you know that family in there?

55:51.420 --> 55:52.700
- Autumn's dad was killed

55:52.700 --> 55:54.823
and I heard she was staying with her aunt.

55:56.203 --> 55:58.253
- How did you know her dad got killed?

56:00.410 --> 56:02.353
- Because I was there when they did it.

56:05.640 --> 56:06.693
Look, Marcus.

56:08.180 --> 56:09.673
We did a lotta bad things,

56:11.950 --> 56:13.350
but I'm here to make amends.

56:15.860 --> 56:17.620
Those people in my story,

56:17.620 --> 56:19.483
they care a lot about secrecy.

56:20.570 --> 56:22.573
Once someone starts snoopin' around,

56:24.630 --> 56:26.980
it's better you don't
know much more than that.

56:29.510 --> 56:30.343
- I don't get it.

56:30.343 --> 56:31.513
You were just a kid.

56:33.380 --> 56:35.083
- They like to coerce street kids.

56:36.260 --> 56:37.850
Maybe 'cause we don't
have much attachment,

56:37.850 --> 56:41.520
but we're also pretty used to violence.

56:41.520 --> 56:43.410
That was a bonus.

56:43.410 --> 56:46.560
- Mia, that girl in there, you healed her.

56:46.560 --> 56:47.883
She's better now.

56:49.080 --> 56:50.140
- Yup.

56:50.140 --> 56:51.303
- Mia, that's insane.

56:52.830 --> 56:53.663
- Yeah.

56:55.170 --> 56:56.920
- How are you so casual about this?

56:58.020 --> 56:59.920
- Trust me, you get used to it.

56:59.920 --> 57:01.640
Is it all the same?

57:01.640 --> 57:05.130
Do you always know what's
gonna happen when you do that?

57:05.130 --> 57:07.570
- Sometimes they see visions.

57:07.570 --> 57:10.650
This one time, this guy's bullet
wound healed up on its own.

57:10.650 --> 57:12.833
- Jesus. (exhales)

57:16.200 --> 57:17.033
All right.

57:18.300 --> 57:19.950
Where are we goin' next?

57:19.950 --> 57:21.681
- Oh no, I can't do that again.

57:21.681 --> 57:23.098
It would kill me.

57:24.113 --> 57:25.559
- Wait, kill you?

57:25.559 --> 57:27.550
What do you mean it would kill you?

57:27.550 --> 57:29.150
- My powers don't work that way.

57:30.200 --> 57:33.303
I'm not using them how they
were supposed to be used.

57:34.990 --> 57:36.490
Takes about a day or so to recharge

57:36.490 --> 57:38.190
'cause my body really takes a hit.

57:39.290 --> 57:41.893
- So if I wanted to kill
ya, now's my chance.

57:44.640 --> 57:45.608
- You wish.

57:45.608 --> 57:48.608
(crickets chirping)

57:53.672 --> 57:54.589
- You okay?

57:59.744 --> 58:03.077
(dark foreboding music)

58:04.707 --> 58:06.450
"Ancient records are inconclusive

58:06.450 --> 58:10.160
as to the identity of
the so-called magic king.

58:10.160 --> 58:12.210
Although some contemporary historians

58:12.210 --> 58:14.340
had concluded the king
was a murderous tyrant,

58:14.340 --> 58:17.953
other records contradict
this account. (sighs)

58:19.480 --> 58:21.200
In Shadowlurker mythology,

58:21.200 --> 58:24.330
the Fellowship of the Fallen
are regarded as great heroes

58:24.330 --> 58:26.180
during Salem's conquest.

58:26.180 --> 58:29.027
They might've easily been the villains."

58:32.722 --> 58:33.555
(screen bleeping)

58:33.555 --> 58:35.956
(dark foreboding music)

58:35.956 --> 58:37.833
That's not good.

58:40.270 --> 58:41.770
Hey, can I show you something?

58:43.110 --> 58:45.090
It's from the night I followed you.

58:45.090 --> 58:48.420
I think that's the same guy
who showed up at my work.

58:48.420 --> 58:50.913
- How in the world did he find me here?

58:52.270 --> 58:54.883
- How are you not more alarmed by this?

58:55.860 --> 58:57.870
- Oh, that's just Kelly.

58:57.870 --> 58:59.120
He's like my big brother.

59:00.230 --> 59:01.360
When we were in foster together,

59:01.360 --> 59:03.570
he used to protect me from the older kids.

59:03.570 --> 59:05.950
Kelly wouldn't hurt me in a million years.

59:05.950 --> 59:07.520
- Are you sure about that?

59:07.520 --> 59:10.620
Because this guy probably
knows where I live.

59:10.620 --> 59:12.520
If Kelly had bad intentions,

59:12.520 --> 59:14.820
neither of us would be
sitting here right now.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.430
- Yeah, it's just he didn't
strike me as all that friendly.

59:19.430 --> 59:20.907
- I didn't say he was friendly

59:20.907 --> 59:22.483
and I said he wouldn't hurt me.

59:23.640 --> 59:24.950
We haven't seen each other in a while.

59:24.950 --> 59:27.710
He's probably tryin' to see if I'm okay,

59:27.710 --> 59:30.060
even if that means
harassing my friend at work.

59:32.870 --> 59:33.703
- Friend?

59:35.990 --> 59:39.120
- You know, I never did thank
you for letting me stay here.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.980
I had been crashing at this warehouse

59:40.980 --> 59:43.230
a few blocks away from your office.

59:43.230 --> 59:46.189
- You were living in a warehouse?

59:46.189 --> 59:47.789
I think we should get some rest.

59:56.176 --> 59:59.509
(dark intriguing music)

1:00:02.126 --> 1:00:05.130
- I haven't seen you around much lately.

1:00:05.130 --> 1:00:06.547
Was startin' to worry.

1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:09.912
- I'm here as always.

1:00:09.912 --> 1:00:14.773
(dark intriguing music)
(birds chirping)

1:00:14.773 --> 1:00:18.273
- If I had to guess, I'd say not for long.

1:00:24.005 --> 1:00:25.672
They gave us a gift.

1:00:27.249 --> 1:00:28.082
- A gift?

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:33.560
- Look, you know our policy.

1:00:35.567 --> 1:00:37.317
You can walk away anytime you want.

1:00:40.259 --> 1:00:41.360
But you'll also be walkin' away

1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:44.093
from all the protection you've
been enjoying for so long.

1:00:45.380 --> 1:00:49.113
And I promise you, the
world is a scary place

1:00:49.113 --> 1:00:51.017
when don't have juice
runnin' through your hands

1:00:51.017 --> 1:00:52.810
and 100 men covering your back.

1:00:54.101 --> 1:00:55.209
- I'm not afraid.

1:00:55.209 --> 1:00:58.542
(dark intriguing music)

1:01:00.318 --> 1:01:04.138
- I know.

1:01:04.138 --> 1:01:05.638
I know you're not.

1:01:07.481 --> 1:01:09.064
That's the problem.

1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:18.213
(smooth rhythmic music)

1:01:39.613 --> 1:01:44.613
(soft intriguing music)
(workers chattering)

1:01:47.578 --> 1:01:50.328
(Marcus sighing)

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:57.040
(cellphone buzzing)
(guns blasting)

1:01:57.040 --> 1:01:58.390
- Hey dude, what's up?

1:01:58.390 --> 1:02:00.905
I'm just gettin' ready for school.

1:02:00.905 --> 1:02:02.040
- Nothing too important.

1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:03.440
I just had a question

1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:07.440
about that comic book you
were tellin' me about.

1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:08.273
- [Troy] Shoot.

1:02:09.550 --> 1:02:11.440
- So these Shadowlurkers,

1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:14.300
do they all have magical powers or what?

1:02:14.300 --> 1:02:15.350
- Well kinda.

1:02:15.350 --> 1:02:18.300
I mean the more powerful
ones have relics or whatnot,

1:02:18.300 --> 1:02:21.823
so a robe or a ring or like a bracelet.

1:02:24.030 --> 1:02:26.022
- Dude, you sound scared.

1:02:26.022 --> 1:02:26.855
Did I get to ya?

1:02:27.990 --> 1:02:28.990
- One more question.

1:02:30.620 --> 1:02:33.003
How would you kill one,

1:02:34.170 --> 1:02:36.290
like if they were after you?

1:02:36.290 --> 1:02:37.123
- I don't know, man.

1:02:37.123 --> 1:02:38.880
I mean I only have the one issue.

1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:41.223
But if I had to guess, I'd say you can't.

1:02:42.110 --> 1:02:43.593
- Okay, but in theory.

1:02:44.490 --> 1:02:47.050
- Well you pretty much can't unless-

1:02:47.050 --> 1:02:48.720
- [Marcus] Unless what?

1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:49.553
- I don't know.

1:02:49.553 --> 1:02:51.030
Maybe if there was another Shadowlurker,

1:02:51.030 --> 1:02:52.780
I bet they could kill each other.

1:02:52.780 --> 1:02:54.362
But it's only a guess.

1:02:54.362 --> 1:02:56.667
Why all of a sudden interest?

1:02:56.667 --> 1:02:57.819
- I gotta go.

1:02:57.819 --> 1:03:01.152
(dark intriguing music)

1:03:03.790 --> 1:03:06.433
- Hey Marcus, can I
borrow you for a second?

1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:09.213
- Yeah.

1:03:10.355 --> 1:03:11.255
Could use a break.

1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:15.933
Wait, say that again?

1:03:16.910 --> 1:03:18.330
- You're fired, Marcus.

1:03:18.330 --> 1:03:19.360
I know.

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:20.760
I know it totally sucks, man.

1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:21.810
And I'm really sorry.

1:03:23.470 --> 1:03:24.690
- You're serious.

1:03:24.690 --> 1:03:25.940
This isn't a joke?

1:03:25.940 --> 1:03:26.993
- [Pedro] I'm afraid not.

1:03:29.270 --> 1:03:30.960
- You're not even allowed to fire me.

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:31.940
We're colleagues.

1:03:31.940 --> 1:03:32.773
- I know.

1:03:32.773 --> 1:03:35.870
But right now, I'm acting as
Carl's proxy in this situation.

1:03:35.870 --> 1:03:37.020
Thought it'd be easier on you

1:03:37.020 --> 1:03:38.240
because you do look up to him.

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:41.440
- Pfft, nobody looks up to Carl.

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:42.700
I got a mortgage, man.

1:03:42.700 --> 1:03:43.713
Like what the hell?

1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:48.640
Can I even get a reason
why they're letting me go?

1:03:51.970 --> 1:03:55.600
- He said somethin' about
you being too passive.

1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:57.800
But to be honest, I
wasn't really listening.

1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:01.893
- I'm too passive and
they're letting you stay?

1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:04.340
- [Pedro] Afraid so.

1:04:05.750 --> 1:04:06.583
- And I'm too passive.

1:04:06.583 --> 1:04:07.960
You look like you're asleep.

1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:10.330
- And half the time I am
and that's the funny part.

1:04:10.330 --> 1:04:13.050
But the world's just not
a fair place, Marcus.

1:04:13.050 --> 1:04:16.543
- Yeah, well thank you so
much for being a great friend.

1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:18.820
And don't get too comfortable.

1:04:18.820 --> 1:04:19.720
Next, you're gonna be in here

1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:21.423
gettin' fired by the damn janitor.

1:04:23.690 --> 1:04:25.703
Nice half-ass man bun.

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:31.994
- It's a half-up, dude.

1:04:31.994 --> 1:04:35.798
(rhythmic rock music)

1:04:35.798 --> 1:04:38.510
(cards shuffling)

1:04:38.510 --> 1:04:39.967
- All right, fellas.

1:04:39.967 --> 1:04:40.933
You know the rules.

1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:44.300
Got the pot comin' up.

1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:45.800
Pot's good.

1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:47.160
Bet's on you, Tommy.

1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:47.993
- Hey, house rules.

1:04:47.993 --> 1:04:48.970
No bullshit, fellas.

1:04:48.970 --> 1:04:50.420
- You wanna talk about some bullshit,

1:04:50.420 --> 1:04:52.333
what happened with that homeless person?

1:04:53.170 --> 1:04:55.310
- Man, we had the rope ready.

1:04:55.310 --> 1:04:56.270
You guys got in my way.

1:04:56.270 --> 1:04:57.630
We had the rope, I was ready.

1:04:57.630 --> 1:04:59.500
- Yeah, we got in his way.
- Bullshit.

1:04:59.500 --> 1:05:00.680
- Right. (chuckles)

1:05:00.680 --> 1:05:02.300
- I'll raise.
- Yeah.

1:05:02.300 --> 1:05:04.100
- I mean but when it comes
to killin' homeless guys,

1:05:04.100 --> 1:05:05.493
my bet's not on you though.

1:05:06.642 --> 1:05:08.220
- What're you sayin', I'm
too chickenshit to do it?

1:05:08.220 --> 1:05:10.370
- Exactly what we're saying.

1:05:10.370 --> 1:05:11.250
We were all there.

1:05:11.250 --> 1:05:12.083
- I think I can handle it.

1:05:12.083 --> 1:05:14.420
I think it can kill any
man any day of the week.

1:05:15.308 --> 1:05:16.677
- [Clint] Oh shit, he
might have somethin'.

1:05:16.677 --> 1:05:17.903
- Blake, it's on you.

1:05:19.156 --> 1:05:20.206
Blake, you all right?

1:05:21.740 --> 1:05:22.573
- Stand up.

1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:28.655
- Kelly, I didn't know you were comin' by.

1:05:28.655 --> 1:05:32.120
(soft foreboding music)

1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:35.750
- You know, there's a
thing called discretion

1:05:40.610 --> 1:05:41.443
and

1:05:42.810 --> 1:05:46.650
only wild dogs attack before
they signal a warning.

1:05:46.650 --> 1:05:48.900
- What, all that crap on the news?

1:05:48.900 --> 1:05:49.900
Man, that wasn't us.

1:05:51.750 --> 1:05:54.853
- Gonna make this vividly
clear to all of you.

1:05:56.803 --> 1:05:59.870
(alcohol trickling)

1:05:59.870 --> 1:06:02.860
You are not one of us.

1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:06.360
You attack at random,
tying people up on poles.

1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:07.700
- Kelly.

1:06:07.700 --> 1:06:09.120
Man

1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:11.558
with respect now, I didn't-

1:06:11.558 --> 1:06:16.523
(chair bashing)
(glass shattering)

1:06:16.523 --> 1:06:20.743
- Your little gang, it's
causing unwanted attention.

1:06:22.590 --> 1:06:26.303
And unfortunately, you can't join us.

1:06:27.290 --> 1:06:28.530
You don't even know the basics.

1:06:28.530 --> 1:06:29.380
- Look, man.

1:06:29.380 --> 1:06:30.700
We're gonna stop everything.

1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:32.810
- Yeah, man. It's not a big deal.

1:06:32.810 --> 1:06:33.710
- I know.

1:06:33.710 --> 1:06:37.560
(dark foreboding music)

1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:38.393
Step forward.

1:06:42.350 --> 1:06:43.295
- C'mon.

1:06:43.295 --> 1:06:46.628
(dark intriguing music)

1:06:53.500 --> 1:06:54.333
Tommy,

1:06:56.512 --> 1:06:59.300
I want you to grip the
handle of this knife

1:07:00.460 --> 1:07:01.473
as tight as you can.

1:07:02.580 --> 1:07:03.959
Pin it to the floor.

1:07:03.959 --> 1:07:07.292
(dark intriguing music)

1:07:08.710 --> 1:07:09.573
Go ahead.

1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:23.843
Now, hold it there.

1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:27.213
Don't move.

1:07:29.890 --> 1:07:30.793
Kneel down for me.

1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:36.553
Good.

1:07:37.480 --> 1:07:38.313
Now

1:07:39.950 --> 1:07:41.502
I want you to fall.

1:07:41.502 --> 1:07:44.330
(dark intriguing music)

1:07:44.330 --> 1:07:45.163
That's right.

1:07:47.010 --> 1:07:47.843
Go ahead.

1:07:48.860 --> 1:07:50.040
- Kelly,

1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:50.873
I'm sorry.

1:07:50.873 --> 1:07:52.903
- Fall on the knife.

1:07:54.350 --> 1:07:58.650
Dazzle us with your amazing powers.

1:07:58.650 --> 1:07:59.660
- Kelly, please.

1:07:59.660 --> 1:08:01.624
Don't make me do this.

1:08:01.624 --> 1:08:03.124
- I'm not gonna ask you again.

1:08:04.470 --> 1:08:06.066
- Kelly, I'm sorry.

1:08:06.066 --> 1:08:09.399
(dark intriguing music)

1:08:11.310 --> 1:08:12.143
- You,

1:08:13.310 --> 1:08:14.143
push him.

1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:17.773
Push him or you're next.

1:08:17.773 --> 1:08:21.315
(dark intriguing music)

1:08:21.315 --> 1:08:24.815
(Blake breathing heavily)

1:08:33.930 --> 1:08:34.763
Wait.

1:08:39.770 --> 1:08:40.603
It's okay.

1:08:41.700 --> 1:08:42.533
It's okay.

1:08:43.683 --> 1:08:45.400
It's okay.

1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:47.000
C'mon.

1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:48.453
Get up.

1:08:48.453 --> 1:08:50.462
Just wanted to mess with
you a little bit, all right?

1:08:50.462 --> 1:08:51.295
- Oh my god.

1:08:51.295 --> 1:08:52.233
- Come on.
- Dude.

1:08:52.233 --> 1:08:54.275
- Look at your face.

1:08:54.275 --> 1:08:56.158
- (sighs) Man I'm sorry.

1:08:56.158 --> 1:08:56.991
It won't ever happen again.

1:08:56.991 --> 1:08:58.707
- You know, on second thought.

1:08:58.707 --> 1:09:00.040
(dark intriguing music)
(knife stabbing)

1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:02.707
(Blake wincing)

1:09:20.643 --> 1:09:22.800
Keep my eye on the news.

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:26.913
Hopefully I won't have to
pay you boys another visit.

1:09:26.913 --> 1:09:30.538
(dark intriguing music)

1:09:30.538 --> 1:09:33.205
(glass banging)

1:09:36.664 --> 1:09:39.997
(television chattering)

1:09:43.190 --> 1:09:44.630
- [Commentator] They've won 45

1:09:44.630 --> 1:09:46.403
of the first 50 games this season.

1:09:48.210 --> 1:09:49.260
No power.

1:09:49.260 --> 1:09:50.400
One home run game.

1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:51.690
No power.

1:09:51.690 --> 1:09:55.207
No production and then caught
fire in the second half.

1:09:55.207 --> 1:09:57.887
- [Commentator] He went on
the disabled list on June 18th

1:09:57.887 --> 1:10:02.368
from an oblique injury and
came back with 19 home runs.

1:10:02.368 --> 1:10:05.120
Part of the reason he
started goin' the other way.

1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:08.300
But in hitting ball with a
little bit more regularity

1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:09.133
right away.

1:10:11.150 --> 1:10:11.983
- [Commentator] Three balls.

1:10:11.983 --> 1:10:13.123
- I lost my job today.

1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:17.510
- I'm sorry.

1:10:17.510 --> 1:10:18.734
- Probably for the best.

1:10:18.734 --> 1:10:20.455
- [Commentator] The Angels
haven't been able to score.

1:10:20.455 --> 1:10:22.995
- I mean it paid well.

1:10:22.995 --> 1:10:24.380
- [Commentator] Hitting at the end

1:10:24.380 --> 1:10:26.662
when Simmons singled to left field.

1:10:26.662 --> 1:10:29.745
- You know, I never needed that much.

1:10:32.870 --> 1:10:37.113
Never needed a awesome
career or even this house.

1:10:39.688 --> 1:10:41.688
None of that ever really mattered to me.

1:10:42.690 --> 1:10:44.130
- Well what did matter?

1:10:44.130 --> 1:10:45.830
- [Commentator] Really
has to be patient because-

1:10:45.830 --> 1:10:47.290
- I don't know.

1:10:47.290 --> 1:10:48.730
I guess-

1:10:48.730 --> 1:10:50.583
- [Commentator] Rush
that fast forward there.

1:10:50.583 --> 1:10:55.583
- I guess all I ever really
wanted was a big Italian family

1:10:56.070 --> 1:10:58.003
like the one I grew up with.

1:10:58.950 --> 1:11:01.400
But my own, you know?

1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:03.330
Someone to come home to, someone to

1:11:05.880 --> 1:11:07.009
fight for.

1:11:07.009 --> 1:11:09.070
- [Commentator] Pitched a good one.

1:11:09.070 --> 1:11:10.610
- [Commentator] That's an
easy answer I would think.

1:11:10.610 --> 1:11:12.450
- [Commentator] I would think? (chuckles)

1:11:12.450 --> 1:11:13.283
- [Commentator] We'll see.

1:11:13.283 --> 1:11:14.943
Good one was called out on strike.

1:11:14.943 --> 1:11:17.633
- Well anyway, for now I just volunteer.

1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.950
I mentor this kid named Troy

1:11:20.950 --> 1:11:23.870
who probably knows more
about life than I do.

1:11:23.870 --> 1:11:25.960
- Wait, you mentor kids?

1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:29.480
- Yeah, his dad passed
away when he was six

1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:31.800
and his mom got into drugs.

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:33.450
She's been clean for a while now.

1:11:35.796 --> 1:11:38.550
I don't know, I just go hang out with him.

1:11:38.550 --> 1:11:40.900
I listen mostly.

1:11:40.900 --> 1:11:45.360
Most people don't need or
want advice or anything.

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:48.420
They just wanna know someone's listening.

1:11:48.420 --> 1:11:49.508
- [Commentator] I can't just power my way

1:11:49.508 --> 1:11:52.688
through these lineups anymore.

1:11:52.688 --> 1:11:57.021
- I really coulda used
someone like that growing up.

1:11:58.217 --> 1:12:01.480
Oh by the way, I went to
the thrift store today.

1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:04.813
I was looking for some headphones
and I found some of these.

1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:08.290
- [Commentator] He missed his spot there.

1:12:08.290 --> 1:12:09.393
- This is what I use.

1:12:10.290 --> 1:12:13.310
- Yeah, I saw you using
them the other day.

1:12:13.310 --> 1:12:15.160
Thought you might need some new ones.

1:12:16.820 --> 1:12:18.650
- Wait, these are for me?

1:12:18.650 --> 1:12:19.941
- Yeah.

1:12:19.941 --> 1:12:21.034
Do you like 'em?

1:12:21.034 --> 1:12:21.867
- Yeah.

1:12:22.790 --> 1:12:24.559
Wow, thank you.

1:12:24.559 --> 1:12:25.976
That's very kind.

1:12:28.890 --> 1:12:30.183
- Have you had dinner?

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:32.913
- No, just

1:12:34.310 --> 1:12:35.390
beer mostly.

1:12:35.390 --> 1:12:37.340
- [Commentator] Took a shine upstairs.

1:12:37.340 --> 1:12:38.774
- Do you want me to make something?

1:12:38.774 --> 1:12:40.380
- [Commentator] There's
1:45 in the third period.

1:12:40.380 --> 1:12:41.800
- You cook?

1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:44.628
- Well do you want eggs?

1:12:44.628 --> 1:12:46.690
- [Commentator] One home run tonight.

1:12:46.690 --> 1:12:48.350
- I could eat eggs.

1:12:48.350 --> 1:12:49.388
- Let's do that.

1:12:49.388 --> 1:12:52.555
(soft soothing music)

1:12:53.514 --> 1:12:56.014

looking down at his shoes

1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:10.363
pavement and gum wrappers.

1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:14.570
Then one day someone comes along

1:15:14.570 --> 1:15:18.683
and grabs him by the face
and forces him to look up.

1:15:20.110 --> 1:15:22.683
And all of a sudden he sees people,

1:15:24.540 --> 1:15:26.853
trees and clouds.

1:15:28.810 --> 1:15:31.680
All these things, he has no context for

1:15:33.962 --> 1:15:37.443
and he has to admit that he
never knew anything ever at all.

1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:41.370
- Are you sorry you looked up?

1:15:44.143 --> 1:15:45.343

of jewelry on your wrist

1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:19.050

1:27:02.669 --> 1:27:05.080

1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:08.200
- Hey Troy, it's Marcus again.

1:27:08.200 --> 1:27:10.350
Just seein' what's up.

1:27:10.350 --> 1:27:12.340
Okay, gimme a call back
whenever you get this.

1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:13.330
Thanks.

1:27:13.330 --> 1:27:14.863
- They're still not picking up?

1:27:15.730 --> 1:27:17.400
- No, I don't get it.

1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:19.113
It's not like either of them.

1:27:21.420 --> 1:27:23.110
Do you mind if we stop by there?

1:27:23.110 --> 1:27:24.110
- No, of course not.

1:27:26.626 --> 1:27:29.376
(birds chirping)

1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:31.910
- Does anybody look home?

1:27:34.290 --> 1:27:35.790
- Maybe they went on vacation.

1:27:38.441 --> 1:27:41.274
(Marcus knocking)

1:27:43.290 --> 1:27:44.123
- Hello?

1:27:45.130 --> 1:27:46.060
I'm coming in.

1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:47.158
It's Marcus.

1:27:47.158 --> 1:27:50.060
(soft foreboding music)

1:27:50.060 --> 1:27:51.033
Sidney.

1:27:52.110 --> 1:27:53.710
Troy.

1:27:53.710 --> 1:27:54.553
Sidney?

1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:06.713
Hello?

1:28:09.700 --> 1:28:10.533
Sidney?

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.313
Where's Troy?

1:28:13.313 --> 1:28:18.313
(soft foreboding music)
(door clacking)

1:28:23.780 --> 1:28:24.753
Dude.

1:28:24.753 --> 1:28:28.086
(dark foreboding music)

1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:34.970
- I know.

1:28:34.970 --> 1:28:37.570
I'm still gettin' used to it myself.

1:28:37.570 --> 1:28:38.630
It's pretty crazy.

1:28:38.630 --> 1:28:40.130
I had no idea I was this tall.

1:28:41.670 --> 1:28:42.503
- Okay.

1:28:43.350 --> 1:28:45.150
You're gonna have to explain to me

1:28:45.150 --> 1:28:47.470
how it is you're standing right now.

1:28:47.470 --> 1:28:49.570
- Oh, I think you know the answer to that.

1:28:51.098 --> 1:28:52.370
You like it?

1:28:52.370 --> 1:28:53.433
I think it suits me.

1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:58.020
Anyway, now I know why you were askin' me

1:28:58.020 --> 1:29:00.400
all those questions the other day.

1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:02.157
However wrote that comic
book knew something

1:29:02.157 --> 1:29:04.091
and now we know it too.

1:29:04.091 --> 1:29:06.291
- That's not why I was
asking you questions.

1:29:07.147 --> 1:29:09.470
- You wanted to know
how to kill one, right?

1:29:09.470 --> 1:29:10.303
'Cause of her.

1:29:14.626 --> 1:29:16.440
- [Marcus] Don't want
to kill anybody, Troy.

1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:17.737
You know me better than that.

1:29:17.737 --> 1:29:20.910
You know, your girlfriend there
knows a lot about killing.

1:29:20.910 --> 1:29:21.833
Did she tell you?

1:29:22.734 --> 1:29:23.567
- C'mon, Troy.

1:29:23.567 --> 1:29:24.770
We're not doin' this.

1:29:24.770 --> 1:29:27.820
- Did she tell you what she
used to do with those hands?

1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:30.203
She's literally the
touch of death, Marcus.

1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:32.560
- Take that off.

1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:33.393
- Come make me

1:29:35.770 --> 1:29:36.850
- Marcus, don't get near him.

1:29:36.850 --> 1:29:38.350
- Who asked you, whore?

1:29:38.350 --> 1:29:39.700
You're a traitor anyway.

1:29:39.700 --> 1:29:41.210
- Troy, listen to me.

1:29:41.210 --> 1:29:43.290
I know them better than you do.

1:29:43.290 --> 1:29:45.400
They're just using you.

1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:48.470
I know what they told you
and I know you feel so strong

1:29:48.470 --> 1:29:52.510
and so free right now, but
they don't tell you the cost.

1:29:52.510 --> 1:29:53.910
- Look, could you shut her up please?

1:29:53.910 --> 1:29:54.860
- She's right, man.

1:29:55.860 --> 1:29:57.580
They're just using you.

1:29:57.580 --> 1:29:59.140
- Fine.

1:29:59.140 --> 1:30:00.604
I'll do it myself.

1:30:00.604 --> 1:30:01.437
- Dude.

1:30:01.437 --> 1:30:02.680
- Seriously, dude?

1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:04.200
You're picking this traitor over me?

1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:05.650
I thought we were brothers.

1:30:05.650 --> 1:30:09.363
- We'll be brothers
again, just not like this.

1:30:12.660 --> 1:30:13.753
- I can't go back.

1:30:15.824 --> 1:30:18.250
I'm not going back to that chair.

1:30:18.250 --> 1:30:20.400
If I have to break every
bone in her body, I will.

1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:21.810
And trust me, I can.

1:30:21.810 --> 1:30:23.060
- Mia.
- Touch me and I'll kill you.

1:30:23.060 --> 1:30:26.000
- He told you to embrace
your freedom, right?

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:27.900
That nobody could ever hurt you again.

1:30:29.820 --> 1:30:30.993
No more bullies.

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:33.140
No more rejection.

1:30:33.140 --> 1:30:34.400
- Don't move.

1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:36.300
- Marcus talks about you all the time.

1:30:38.690 --> 1:30:40.033
There's kindness in you.

1:30:41.950 --> 1:30:43.520
Don't let them take that away.

1:30:43.520 --> 1:30:44.657
- I'm warning you.

1:30:44.657 --> 1:30:47.220
You haven't seen what I can do.

1:30:47.220 --> 1:30:49.043
- That ring doesn't make you strong.

1:30:50.550 --> 1:30:51.811
It makes you weak.

1:30:51.811 --> 1:30:55.144
(soft intriguing music)

1:30:56.637 --> 1:30:57.470
- I can't.

1:30:59.440 --> 1:31:00.273
- Look at me.

1:31:01.640 --> 1:31:02.473
I'll help you.

1:31:04.279 --> 1:31:05.810
- I'm not going back.

1:31:05.810 --> 1:31:07.060
- Do you feel that?

1:31:07.060 --> 1:31:07.993
Feel my hands.

1:31:09.180 --> 1:31:10.013
- Please.

1:31:12.462 --> 1:31:14.039
Please stop showing me this.

1:31:14.039 --> 1:31:17.372
(soft intriguing music)

1:31:26.242 --> 1:31:28.909
(ring clinking)

1:31:31.108 --> 1:31:32.491
- It's okay.

1:31:32.491 --> 1:31:34.323
You're okay.

1:31:34.323 --> 1:31:35.451
I got you now.

1:31:35.451 --> 1:31:38.618
(soft soothing music)

1:32:05.312 --> 1:32:08.645
(Mia breathing heavily)

1:32:10.251 --> 1:32:11.540
(Mia wincing)

1:32:11.540 --> 1:32:12.373
- Careful.

1:32:13.330 --> 1:32:14.530
You okay?

1:32:14.530 --> 1:32:15.548
- I'm fine.

1:32:15.548 --> 1:32:18.298
(birds chirping)

1:32:21.260 --> 1:32:23.453
- Hey, we did the right
thing back there, right?

1:32:26.920 --> 1:32:27.753
- Yes.

1:32:32.210 --> 1:32:35.133
- Well do you think you
can you know, help him out?

1:32:36.810 --> 1:32:38.213
- Like make him walk?

1:32:39.560 --> 1:32:40.563
- Yeah, can you?

1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:43.700
- It doesn't always work that way.

1:32:46.310 --> 1:32:47.920
- I saw you help that little girl.

1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:49.143
Can't you just try?

1:32:52.060 --> 1:32:53.863
- My power already went into him.

1:32:55.548 --> 1:32:57.148
- Well then why isn't he better?

1:33:02.106 --> 1:33:02.939
- He is.

1:33:02.939 --> 1:33:05.689
(birds chirping)

1:33:15.769 --> 1:33:17.490
(Mia wincing)

1:33:17.490 --> 1:33:19.050
- Careful.

1:33:19.050 --> 1:33:19.883
- We have to go.

1:33:25.137 --> 1:33:28.470
(dark foreboding music)

1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:31.607
- Hey, just get some rest, okay?

1:33:31.607 --> 1:33:34.260
- I have a surprise
in-store for old Marcus.

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:35.293
- You like it?

1:33:35.293 --> 1:33:36.723
I think it suits me.

1:33:38.210 --> 1:33:39.924
- I'll go make us somethin' to eat.

1:33:39.924 --> 1:33:42.840
So if I want him to kill
ya, now's my chance.

1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:44.013
- I'm so stupid.

1:33:44.940 --> 1:33:47.290
I can't believe I'm this stupid.

1:33:47.290 --> 1:33:49.067
- Wait, what are you talkin' about?

1:33:50.460 --> 1:33:51.493
- It was a setup.

1:33:53.430 --> 1:33:54.343
He played me.

1:33:57.215 --> 1:33:58.860
- You mean Kelly.

1:33:58.860 --> 1:34:00.663
- He's not who I thought he was.

1:34:02.010 --> 1:34:03.133
I'm sorry I brought you into this.

1:34:03.133 --> 1:34:03.966
- No, stop.

1:34:03.966 --> 1:34:05.060
It's okay, don't worry about it.

1:34:05.060 --> 1:34:06.590
But you have to tell me is he
gonna try somethin' tonight?

1:34:06.590 --> 1:34:08.540
- He knows I'll be better in the morning.

1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:12.580
Look, can you just find
somewhere to go, somewhere safe?

1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:13.660
Just not here.

1:34:13.660 --> 1:34:14.903
He knows I'm here.

1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:17.220
- No, I'm not goin' anywhere.

1:34:17.220 --> 1:34:18.783
We're in this together, okay?

1:34:19.820 --> 1:34:23.173
- Marcus, even if you were like us,

1:34:24.410 --> 1:34:25.833
this isn't your fight.

1:34:27.503 --> 1:34:29.652
- I'm staying with you.

1:34:29.652 --> 1:34:30.998
- I'm begging you.

1:34:30.998 --> 1:34:34.331
(soft intriguing music)

1:34:46.210 --> 1:34:47.083
- Pedro, hey man.

1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:49.293
- Marcus.

1:34:51.110 --> 1:34:52.260
What's goin' on, buddy?

1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:57.163
- Listen, all that stuff that
went down a little while ago,

1:34:58.380 --> 1:34:59.730
just forget about it, okay?

1:35:01.475 --> 1:35:04.400
- (sighs) Dude, I am really
sorry about what happened.

1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:06.200
I actually got fired two days after.

1:35:07.350 --> 1:35:09.060
- You got fired too?

1:35:09.060 --> 1:35:09.893
Man.

1:35:11.170 --> 1:35:12.532
Who did it?

1:35:12.532 --> 1:35:15.920
- Dude, you'll never
guess who I got fired by.

1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:17.253
I got fired by Jerry.

1:35:18.550 --> 1:35:19.390
- From accounting?

1:35:19.390 --> 1:35:21.380
Oh my god, you got fired
by a friggin' temp.

1:35:21.380 --> 1:35:23.400
That's way worse. (chuckles)

1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:25.780
- [Pedro] Yeah, I'm pretty
sure I deserve it though.

1:35:25.780 --> 1:35:26.680
- Hey listen, man.

1:35:28.060 --> 1:35:29.300
This is gonna sound really random,

1:35:29.300 --> 1:35:32.483
but didn't you use to box?

1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:36.652
- I was Golden Glove
champion back when I was 12.

1:35:36.652 --> 1:35:38.270
What's goin' on?

1:35:38.270 --> 1:35:40.380
- How soon can you get over to my place?

1:35:40.380 --> 1:35:41.213
- [Pedro] This time of night, man?

1:35:41.213 --> 1:35:43.730
Probably like 20 minutes give or take.

1:35:43.730 --> 1:35:44.710
- Perfect and

1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:47.890
bring weapons.

1:35:47.890 --> 1:35:49.310
- Now we're talkin'.

1:35:49.310 --> 1:35:54.310
(dark intriguing music)
(crickets chirping)

1:35:57.047 --> 1:36:00.214
(wind chimes chiming)

1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:07.160
- Please don't come here.

1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:08.840
Please don't come here.

1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:09.673
Don't do this.

1:36:09.673 --> 1:36:10.573
They're good people.

1:36:14.140 --> 1:36:14.973
Please.

1:36:17.770 --> 1:36:19.270
Just tell me what I should do.

1:36:25.327 --> 1:36:26.494
The warehouse?

1:36:30.500 --> 1:36:32.318
I'll be there in 30.

1:36:32.318 --> 1:36:35.651
(dark intriguing music)

1:36:38.851 --> 1:36:41.851
(crickets chirping)

1:36:46.300 --> 1:36:48.830
- Nothing gets past this
front door tonight, got it?

1:36:48.830 --> 1:36:49.663
- Copy that.

1:36:50.779 --> 1:36:53.323
- (sniffs) Do you smell gasoline?

1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:56.553
- Yeah.

1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:00.380
- Okay.

1:37:00.380 --> 1:37:03.950
- Oh by the way, I said to make her smile.

1:37:03.950 --> 1:37:05.250
Not fall in love with her.

1:37:07.140 --> 1:37:08.090
- It's complicated.

1:37:12.111 --> 1:37:13.114
- It always is.

1:37:13.114 --> 1:37:18.114
(dark intriguing music)
(crickets chirping)

1:37:20.504 --> 1:37:23.837
(soft foreboding music)

1:37:30.399 --> 1:37:33.399
(crickets chirping)

1:37:53.434 --> 1:37:56.434
(crickets chirping)

1:38:17.070 --> 1:38:18.570
- Hey Mia, you feelin' better?

1:38:19.950 --> 1:38:22.581
Mia? (knocks)

1:38:22.581 --> 1:38:25.914
(dark intriguing music)

1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:33.980
Pedro, Mia bolted.

1:38:33.980 --> 1:38:34.813
Stay here and guard the house.

1:38:34.813 --> 1:38:36.135
I think I know where she went.

1:38:36.135 --> 1:38:37.920
(dark intriguing music)
(crickets chirping)

1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:39.320
- Good luck, soldier.

1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:40.153
Good luck.

1:38:45.013 --> 1:38:48.346
(dark foreboding music)

1:39:00.510 --> 1:39:02.360
- [Mia] How did you even get in here?

1:39:20.534 --> 1:39:23.284
(knife clicking)

1:39:26.615 --> 1:39:29.940
- You still listen to music at night,

1:39:29.940 --> 1:39:31.653
block out all the screams?

1:39:36.970 --> 1:39:38.620
- I know why you brought me here.

1:39:41.790 --> 1:39:43.090
- Feel free to fight back.

1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:47.310
- Promise me that when I'm gone,

1:39:47.310 --> 1:39:48.823
you're not gonna hurt Marcus.

1:39:50.510 --> 1:39:52.894
- Grant you that one for old-time's sake.

1:39:52.894 --> 1:39:55.393
- You know, you didn't need
to bring the kid into this.

1:39:56.390 --> 1:39:58.490
I never stood a chance against you anyway.

1:40:00.430 --> 1:40:01.263
- I know,

1:40:02.936 --> 1:40:04.144
but why risk it?

1:40:04.144 --> 1:40:07.200
(soft foreboding music)

1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:09.623
- We knew each other before they found us.

1:40:10.550 --> 1:40:12.447
It doesn't have to end this way.

1:40:13.650 --> 1:40:14.850
Things can be different.

1:40:16.490 --> 1:40:17.543
I can show you.

1:40:22.070 --> 1:40:23.658
- Do you really mean that?

1:40:23.658 --> 1:40:26.825
(soft poignant music)

1:40:33.223 --> 1:40:34.890
Here's what I'll do:

1:40:37.450 --> 1:40:38.283
go back,

1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:41.473
tell 'em I never found you.

1:40:43.815 --> 1:40:45.865
Me and you can just go our separate ways.

1:40:58.690 --> 1:40:59.940
Bye, butterfly.

1:41:04.737 --> 1:41:07.590
(dark intriguing music)

1:41:07.590 --> 1:41:10.257
(Kelly wincing)

1:41:37.715 --> 1:41:40.382
(Kelly weeping)

1:41:51.042 --> 1:41:54.541
(soft poignant music)

1:41:54.541 --> 1:41:56.511
- What'd you do?

1:41:56.511 --> 1:41:57.344
- Sorry.

1:41:58.629 --> 1:41:59.797
- Mia.

1:41:59.797 --> 1:42:01.630
- [Kelly] I didn't know.

1:42:02.968 --> 1:42:04.680
- Mia.
- I didn't know.

1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:09.680
(soft poignant music)
(Marcus weeping)

1:42:35.306 --> 1:42:39.383
(crow cawing)
(birds chirping)

1:42:39.383 --> 1:42:42.550
(soft poignant music)

1:42:52.377 --> 1:42:53.577
- I'm sorry, my brother.

1:42:54.490 --> 1:42:56.990
I know you guys got really
close there at the end.

1:42:58.700 --> 1:43:00.410
- Yeah.

1:43:00.410 --> 1:43:02.470
Thank you guys for comin' though.

1:43:02.470 --> 1:43:03.493
I know this is lame.

1:43:06.150 --> 1:43:07.283
- No, it's not lame.

1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:12.868
We all have to grieve
in our own ways, right?

1:43:12.868 --> 1:43:16.035
(soft poignant music)

1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:29.510
- You still sellin' that house?

1:43:30.350 --> 1:43:33.690
- Yeah, it just make sense.

1:43:33.690 --> 1:43:35.140
I can't really afford it now.

1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:39.893
- My mom said if you want,
you can come stay with us.

1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:41.873
- Thank you, buddy.

1:43:41.873 --> 1:43:42.913
I appreciate it,

1:43:43.790 --> 1:43:45.613
but I think I'm gonna hit the road.

1:43:46.470 --> 1:43:48.963
You know, just clear my head.

1:43:51.186 --> 1:43:54.600
- 'Least you don't have
those Shadowlurkers on you.

1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:56.570
- Yeah, it seems once Mia died,

1:43:56.570 --> 1:43:58.290
they sorta lost interest, you know?

1:43:58.290 --> 1:43:59.123
Go figure.

1:44:02.430 --> 1:44:05.010
She was unusually smart though.

1:44:05.010 --> 1:44:06.760
Everyone always underestimated her,

1:44:09.830 --> 1:44:10.663
even me.

1:44:13.616 --> 1:44:16.616
(soft serene music)
