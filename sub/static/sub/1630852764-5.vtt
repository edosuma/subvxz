00:35.827 --> 00:42.208


01:15.825 --> 01:16.743
Mom!

01:16.826 --> 01:19.704
I know!
We don't slam drawers in this house.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.872
Not that.

01:21.873 --> 01:22.832
This.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.125
What the…

01:24.209 --> 01:27.253
"Want your business on blast?
Break up in Town Square!"

01:28.046 --> 01:30.507
"#SerenitySecrets415."

01:31.132 --> 01:33.218
Wha… How do we fix this?

01:33.301 --> 01:36.137
-Is there a time machine in the garage?
-Seriously, Annie!

01:36.221 --> 01:37.555
How do I get that taken down?

01:37.639 --> 01:40.558
You could ask nicely,
but they probably won't.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.311
It already has 73 comments.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.022
-That you should not read.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.487
Serenity needs a better hobby.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.833
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

02:05.667 --> 02:07.085
-Okay.
-Ooh!

02:07.168 --> 02:09.546
I will trade you a cheddar stick
for your potato chips.

02:10.046 --> 02:13.633
-Throw in the protein bar, you got a deal.
-All right.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.177
Yeah, my mom needs to buy better snacks.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.638
Well, maybe you should go
to the store for her.

02:18.721 --> 02:21.516
-I don't know how to cook.
-Okay, shoppin' isn't cookin'.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.642
Unfortunately.

02:24.602 --> 02:28.439
But I do appreciate
your agreeing to a picnic breakfast.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.276
And I appreciate your making time.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.279
You're so much busier than I am, and…

02:35.446 --> 02:39.492
I… I just don't wanna be the thing
that you have to plan your life around.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.703
Like piano lessons?

02:41.786 --> 02:44.038
-You play piano?
-Not anymore.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.213
Like I wouldn't make time for you.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.139
What are you up to today?

03:02.891 --> 03:04.475
I got chores at home and at the spa,

03:04.976 --> 03:07.478
and my dad wants to watch
the Braves game later.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.815
I don't wanna watch them do what I can't.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.484
-Then do something else with him.
-No.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.446
Baseball is the only thing we do.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.864
Or did.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.200
Really?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.163
Daddy and I are nothing alike,

03:26.664 --> 03:28.249
but we can talk about anything.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.668
-What?

03:30.752 --> 03:34.255
He doesn't act preoccupied
or try to change the subject at all?

03:34.339 --> 03:35.924
-No, not at all.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.802
I… I learn things,
and we get to spend time together.

03:43.514 --> 03:46.935
Just find something your dad likes
and pretend to like it too.

03:51.272 --> 03:54.067
And, uh, don't forget your raisins.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.612
You know, I've never been a fan.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.281
Well, you just don't understand
how sweet they are.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.637
-This summer sucks.
-Language, Kyle.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.222
No drama camp, no <i>Hamilton</i>.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.517
Hey, I think your dad and I have been
reasonable under the circumstances.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.895
-And now stupid community service.
-It's what Judge St. Clair ordered.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.856
Because the Lewises made a huge deal
about my "depraved" behavior.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.734
They did, but it was
Judge St. Clair's decision.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.821
And part of accepting responsibility
for what you did

04:39.904 --> 04:42.407
is seeing the consequences through.
Come on.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.076
Dr. Ashley calls it
"ownership of my life."

04:45.159 --> 04:47.412
Okay, I own this,
so I can do it by myself.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.456
I have no doubt.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.969
I need this break from my usual crowd.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.305
They've been bringing too much drama.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.182
Ooh! Like what?
I'm always the last to hear anything.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.143
Because you're always the first
to tell it.

05:10.226 --> 05:13.187
It's not my fault.
Information wants to be free.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.399
Ty Townsend is here.

05:17.734 --> 05:21.362
Why? Is a little Townsend-free time
too much to ask for?

05:21.446 --> 05:24.282
What? I thought you were, like,
his sister from another mister.

05:24.365 --> 05:27.702
Yeah, if sisters are expected to orbit
around you and think you're perfect

05:27.785 --> 05:31.122
and put up with chaos and vanity
without so much as a thank you.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.083
Well, according to <i>my</i> big sister, yes.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.543
Absolutely yes.

05:35.626 --> 05:36.461
Hey.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.087
Hey.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.881
-Hey, Ty.
-How you guys doing?

05:40.548 --> 05:43.051
You never do Vacation Bible School.
What are you doing here?

05:43.801 --> 05:46.888
-I can't exactly go to baseball camp.
-That's so awesome.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.974
In your time of trial, you think of others
and come to help at church.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.225
We're so lucky.

05:51.809 --> 05:52.643
Blessed.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.398
Yeah, okay.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.948
-Could he be any more perfect?
-Yes.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.368
You only think that
because you've known him your whole life.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.411
Which means I know the truth behind the…

06:11.913 --> 06:14.207
Aunt Maddie probably voluntold him
to be here.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.792
<i>And</i> he respects his mama?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.879
I don't wanna diminish
the reason why you're here, Kyle,

06:19.962 --> 06:24.300
but I do encourage you
to look at this not simply as punishment

06:24.384 --> 06:28.137
but as an opportunity to give back
to the community that's nurtured you.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.640
I want you to know
that I'm committed to contributing

06:30.723 --> 06:32.183
to the full extent of my gifts.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.727
-That's the spirit, Kyle.
-And the Holy Spirit too.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.732
Ladies and gentlemen,
may we have some willing hands up here?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.275
This will only take a moment.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.195
These are decorations.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.321
If you take 'em out front,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.407
Mrs. Shafer will let you know
where they go.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.991
-No problem, Pastor June.
-Oh.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.911
I have different plans for you, Kyle.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.038
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.415
Follow me.

07:00.044 --> 07:03.840
Um, don't worry, Kyle, I'm not putting you
into service as an acolyte.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.258
Thank goodness.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.885
Do you know how to polish silver?

07:08.845 --> 07:12.140
-I could be an acolyte.
-Serve the Lord with gladness.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.475
Come before his presence with singing.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.686
Yes, ma'am,
but I guess I'm not in a musicals mood.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.230
There's a stool right there.

07:19.814 --> 07:23.192
I'll be back to check on you,
and I'll be sure to bring you a snack.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.665
Would have been nice
to have you in court, for Kyle's sake.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.792
Well, I wasn't sure he'd want me there.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.461
Really?

07:42.336 --> 07:44.714
Fine. Skip over the hard stuff.
I'll take care of it.

07:45.339 --> 07:46.174
You're angry.

07:46.257 --> 07:51.137
I try not to be, but sometimes no matter
how I dress it up, my slip still shows.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.265
Everybody I love has a reason to hate me.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.018
Our kids don't hate you, Bill.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.604
And neither do I.

08:03.357 --> 08:06.569
Well, I'm so grateful for that.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.655
But still,
I've been thinking on this a lot,

08:09.739 --> 08:13.659
and I've decided that the best thing
that I can do for y'all right now

08:13.743 --> 08:15.578
is give you some space.

08:16.496 --> 08:21.459
So… you're looking
at the new head of pediatrics

08:21.542 --> 08:23.085
for Pioneer Medical Center.

08:23.169 --> 08:27.173
I dissolved my partnership with Howie,
moved into an apartment in Castlewood.

08:27.256 --> 08:31.761
I'll just be a phone call or text away
if anybody needs anything or,

08:33.054 --> 08:35.097
you know, if anybody needs me.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.015
Well,

08:37.058 --> 08:38.059
congratulations.

08:38.142 --> 08:42.897
I'd like to be the one to tell the kids
if… if you don't mind.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.148
No, of course.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.984
I'll let them know you're coming by,
if that's good for you.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.113
Thank you for, um…

08:51.989 --> 08:53.241
Well, for everything.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.415
I need you to be point person
on the produce shipments here on in.

09:01.916 --> 09:02.959
Really?

09:03.042 --> 09:07.380
Well, I'm committed to the farm
and all the fresh bushels.

09:07.463 --> 09:08.548
I'm sure.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.510
Just not looking
to get entangled up with Jeremy anymore.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.303
I understand.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.514
Heartbreaker.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.561
Does everybody know?

09:23.479 --> 09:24.730
-Well, great.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.985
I don't love my personal business
being broadcast.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.695
Yeah, then why do you live in Serenity?

09:31.320 --> 09:34.991
Good morning, partner!
Top of the day, Team Sullivan's!

09:35.491 --> 09:37.243
You're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.789
I was thinking, how about a summer menu
tied to a concert series in the square?

09:41.872 --> 09:46.460
Ooh! With specialty cocktails
named after the artists' biggest hits.

09:46.544 --> 09:50.715
Yes. Yes! Or… or maybe,
uh, a YouTube series.

09:50.798 --> 09:54.260
"Sullivan's, straight from our kitchen
to your stomachs."

09:55.136 --> 09:56.304
Hmm?

09:56.387 --> 09:57.763
-Partner.
-Yeah.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.681
Come here.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.395
If you wanna learn
the restaurant business…

10:04.478 --> 10:05.313
Yeah.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.564
…this is where you begin.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.651
Start scrubbin'.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.908
-He's gonna do it.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.955
I couldn't believe it
when I went through what Zoila gave me.

10:23.873 --> 10:27.168
Fast Molasses LLC
not only bought the Wilkinson place,

10:27.251 --> 10:28.961
it bought eight other lots,

10:29.045 --> 10:32.214
all fast-tracked from residential
to commercial conversions.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.801
You'll particularly enjoy
the one I circled in red.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.389
My landlord sold my office
to these schemers?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.390
Mm-hmm.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.145
Of course. My building and all the rest
would make great parking lots

10:46.228 --> 10:48.981
for Gaynell's salon and Deb's flower shop,

10:49.065 --> 10:53.069
and… and this is that old auto shop
right across the street from Wharton's

10:53.152 --> 10:54.695
and Collins' hardware store.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.613
Mm-hmm.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.158
This isn't just a land grab.
This is a cash grab.

10:59.241 --> 11:03.037
Poor Zoila thought she'd lose her job
for giving us this information.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.748
Have you had any luck
finding out who's behind Fast Molasses?

11:05.831 --> 11:09.752
Oh, not only did I find out,
but you're gonna love the answer

11:09.835 --> 11:12.672
on a level unbecoming
a good Lutheran woman.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.766
-How are we gonna handle this?
-Head-on.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.936
I have a meeting,
but I'll get over there a bit later.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.355
No. I will handle this.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.314
Go easy.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.649
Or at least call me,

11:31.732 --> 11:34.485
and give me a head start
so I can come up with a good alibi.

11:37.029 --> 11:41.158
And if you don't get the answer you want,
you tell him I'll make the next call.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.664
Maddie. What brings you by?

11:47.498 --> 11:48.666
Real estate.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.960
That is your line of work,
isn't it, Mary Vaughn?

11:51.043 --> 11:54.255
Are you selling that beautiful house
of yours and leaving town?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.382
Fresh starts <i>can</i> work wonders.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.592
Not the kind of property
I'm interested in.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.803
I'm actually here
to talk to you about a parking lot.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.930
Oh, for your parking issues at the spa.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.307
I'd be happy to help you with that.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.144
Let's see.
What might be close enough to work?

12:08.227 --> 12:11.564
I know. How about the old Wilkinson place?

12:11.647 --> 12:14.608
-It's right behind us.
-What a fascinating idea.

12:14.692 --> 12:15.651
Isn't it though?

12:16.152 --> 12:19.572
Especially since it's just been rezoned
from residential to commercial,

12:19.655 --> 12:22.658
mere moments after
old man Wilkinson sold it to an LLC

12:22.742 --> 12:26.704
that also bought the old auto shop,
the duplex on Palmetto Drive,

12:26.787 --> 12:31.333
Helen's office, and the land
that the town leases for the dog park.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.252
For the holy love of Pete, Mary Vaughn,

12:33.335 --> 12:35.713
tell me you're not planning
on paving over that dog park.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.885
Well, my daddy always said
to invest in real estate

12:40.968 --> 12:43.387
since God's not making
any more land.

12:43.471 --> 12:47.016
Do you really think these deals
are befitting the mayor and his wife?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.477
Nothing Trent and I are doing is illegal.

12:49.560 --> 12:53.314
Yet you're funneling everything
through an LLC incorporated in Delaware.

12:53.397 --> 12:57.109
That's tax strategy.
Maddie, it's just good business.

12:58.527 --> 13:02.364
Everything that Trent and I are doing,
we are doing for the good of Serenity.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.450
To build business, to attract industry.

13:04.533 --> 13:08.412
To use Town Council
to change regulations so they benefit you,

13:09.205 --> 13:10.873
to make yourselves rich.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.169
Do you know what happens
when you kick a hornets' nest?

13:15.711 --> 13:16.754
You get stung.

13:16.837 --> 13:20.466
That's a small price to pay
for being able to exterminate the hornets.

13:24.887 --> 13:25.763
Bless your heart.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.864
Why did you and Pastor June think
this would be a good next step?

13:43.948 --> 13:48.035
Well, since your birth mother
highlighted this passage in your Bible,

13:48.118 --> 13:50.913
perhaps our next clue
is in <i>The</i> <i>Sentinel </i>archives.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.874
Hopefully, we can get one step closer
to your truth.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.794
And I know where to start.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.338
-Is Peggy in? Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.094
-Peggy.
-Helen!

14:06.428 --> 14:09.515
-Pardon the intrusion.
-<i>The</i> <i>Sentinel'</i>s doors are always open.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.726
-Hmm. Let me introduce you to--
-I… I know Miss Peggy from Sullivan's.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.812
So, how can I help the two of you?

14:14.895 --> 14:16.355
We're doing some research.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.108
Looking for information
on a Serenity resident.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.442
You are wise to come here.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.236
Reporters write
the first draft of history.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.573
Are <i>The</i> <i>Sentinel</i>'s archives
digitized or on microfiche?

14:25.656 --> 14:27.992
-How far back do you need to go?
-1998.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.953
Okay. So these highlighted passages

14:32.079 --> 14:35.875
might relate to a person or an event
that <i>The</i> <i>Sentinel </i>covered.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.835
-I'm not sure if--
-Stop.

14:40.963 --> 14:41.964
I know them all.

14:45.342 --> 14:49.388
"And now abide faith, hope, love."

14:50.764 --> 14:54.810
"These three things,
and the greater of these is love."

14:56.312 --> 14:58.355
That one was always my favorite.

15:02.526 --> 15:06.488
Oh! Um, you, uh…
You two deserve some privacy.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.537
You know where to find me.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.258
-This isn't how--
-I never-- I'm sorry. Um…

15:27.384 --> 15:28.552
You first.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.641
You…

15:34.475 --> 15:35.517
You're him.

15:39.980 --> 15:40.940
You're here?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.527
Uh…

15:47.029 --> 15:49.073
Please, um, give me…

15:59.708 --> 16:01.794
Kyle, Katie, you coming?

16:04.046 --> 16:04.880
Hey, Dad.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.092
So I've been looking for something
to read this summer,

16:08.175 --> 16:11.095
and I… I found this on the shelf
with the books you left here.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.137
What do you think?

16:12.221 --> 16:14.264
I'm embarrassed to say, uh,

16:14.348 --> 16:18.477
your nana gave me this
some Christmas ago, and, uh…

16:19.687 --> 16:22.356
Well, I never did have time to read it.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.651
-Hi, Daddy!
-Hey, there she is!

16:25.734 --> 16:27.569
All right, come sit down there.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.907
It sure is good
to sit here with all three of you.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.243
-Are you here for dinner?
-No.

16:34.326 --> 16:39.415
I came to share
some exciting news with y'all.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.461
I've accepted a new job in Castlewood.

16:45.004 --> 16:49.133
Now, y'all might not see it right away,
but I wanna do this for you.

16:49.216 --> 16:52.553
This job is gonna let me
help you and your mom more,

16:52.636 --> 16:56.348
and, you know,
I… I will be a little bit further away,

16:56.432 --> 16:58.767
and I'm sorry about that,
but I'll still be here

16:58.851 --> 17:01.478
whenever you need anything,
just like always.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.107
Well, what do you think?

17:05.190 --> 17:07.443
It's exciting!
Castlewood has Chuck E. Cheese.

17:07.526 --> 17:11.113
It does indeed, Katydid,
and guess what else.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.657
My apartment complex even has a pool.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.783
-Cool.
-All right?

17:14.867 --> 17:18.746
So, look, I got all three of you keys

17:18.829 --> 17:21.957
'cause… well, 'cause it's your home too.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.586
Thanks, Dad.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.129
Okay.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.214
I love you, sweetheart.

17:31.258 --> 17:35.137
Kyle, that's yours there,
and, uh, come on now.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.101
Well, good luck.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.019
All right.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.614
Son?

17:55.032 --> 17:57.409
Judge St. Clair
sentenced me to community service.

17:57.910 --> 17:58.869
Yeah.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.246
Your mom told me.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.498
Why weren't you there?

18:03.707 --> 18:06.376
Well, I wasn't sure
if you'd want me to be.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.671
Listen, Kyle,

18:09.755 --> 18:13.675
I'm still trying to figure out
what helps and what hurts,

18:13.759 --> 18:16.720
and, well, I knew your mom had it covered.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.059
Glad to know you're here
whenever we need you.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.225
-Fancy footwork.
-Nice! Take it up! You got it!

19:03.308 --> 19:04.560
Oh!

19:04.643 --> 19:06.645
Are you saying
I don't know how to woo a woman?

19:07.146 --> 19:10.190
No, I'm saying
I just might be better at it than you.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.275
What? No.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.609
Isn't there a difference

19:12.693 --> 19:15.571
between wooing a new love
and winning back your estranged wife?

19:15.654 --> 19:17.197
-Ah, thank you, Howie!
-Really?

19:19.950 --> 19:22.703
-You seeing anyone, Howie?
-No one serious.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.329
-You?
-Nah.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.416
May I point out that I'm
the only happily married man in this game?

19:27.499 --> 19:30.961
-No. I'm married. I'm happy.
-She just won't let you back in the house.

19:32.129 --> 19:35.465
Again, is this the guy that we should be
taking advice from? I'm just sayin'.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.384
I admit I have some work to do,

19:37.467 --> 19:39.928
but now that Farmer Jeremy
is out of the picture,

19:40.012 --> 19:43.932
I can finally reclaim my rightful place
next to my beautiful wife.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.268
-Oh!
-Nice!

19:50.063 --> 19:52.482
You don't always have to be so aggressive,
my friends.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.568
Stay close and patient,

19:54.651 --> 19:56.320
and keep it nice and easy.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.573
Are we talking about
someone specific, Erik?

20:00.741 --> 20:03.619
No. We're giving Ronnie advice.

20:03.702 --> 20:04.953
You talking about Helen?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.246
-No.
-You sure?

20:06.330 --> 20:09.458
No. Not now. Not even if
there was something to talk about.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.294
Keeping something like this to yourself
is against the law in Serenity.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.129
All right. Excuse me, gentlemen.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.299
I thought we were here to play, huh?

20:20.761 --> 20:22.429
Dude! What did you--

20:22.512 --> 20:25.098
There's the game, Erik,
then there's the game.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.610
There you are.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.111
We rang the bell.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.571
Thank you all for coming to visit.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.199
Thanks for letting Helen
share the news with us.

20:42.282 --> 20:45.577
Yeah, I need all the prayers I can get.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.620
Isaac?

20:49.915 --> 20:50.916
She walked away.

20:52.709 --> 20:53.835
Again.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.843
-You planting flowers?
-Yeah, I was… I was going to.

21:02.469 --> 21:06.640
-We don't wanna interrupt.
-Eight hands <i>are</i> better than two.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.200
That poor young man.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.493
That poor woman.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.328
That poor 16-year-old girl.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.584
Peggy is Isaac's mom.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.919
-Wow!

21:36.003 --> 21:39.298
I certainly wouldn't have marched
into her office the way I did

21:39.381 --> 21:41.383
had I a whisker of suspicion.

21:41.466 --> 21:42.801
Oh, good grief.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.137
While we were fussing
about Jessamine Juniors,

21:45.220 --> 21:47.014
she was off having a baby.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.181
Heavenly days.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.477
That was the year
that Peggy and her mama went to Memphis

21:52.561 --> 21:55.230
because Mr. and Mrs. Martin
were having marriage problems.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.149
Oh, so Peggy got pregnant there.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.443
Isaac was adopted in Mississippi.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.236
Mm, maybe that's where the dad is from?

22:01.320 --> 22:04.239
Maybe she went there pregnant,
and the dad is from Serenity.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.409
And the whole trip was a cover-up.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.162
Okay, ladies. No.
Let's not leap to assumptions.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.622
The best help that we can offer here

22:12.706 --> 22:15.208
is to support Isaac
while he figures this out.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.545
Supporting Peggy too, if she's open to it.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.298
-To Peggy.
-To Peggy.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.134
-Hmm.
-Hmm. Mmm.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.261
Yeah. Let's head over.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.846
Speaking of Peggy,

22:28.972 --> 22:30.974
how did the meeting with Mary Vaughn go?

22:31.933 --> 22:33.643
-She didn't deny it.
-Mm-hmm?

22:33.727 --> 22:35.520
She actually seemed proud.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.523
We have to fix our parking problem
without buying that lot.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.567
I do not wanna line her greasy pockets.

22:40.650 --> 22:43.153
-Yeah, agreed.
-We can't afford to buy it anyway.

22:43.236 --> 22:46.239
What if we set up something
with Wharton's? Clients can park there,

22:46.323 --> 22:49.326
and we could shuttle them
to the spa and… and back again.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.412
Yeah, we could give 'em a coupon
for a meal at Wharton's.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.623
-Yeah.
-Let's talk to Neville and Grace tomorrow.

22:54.706 --> 22:58.543
We have to nip this in the bud
before Mary Vaughn does any more damage.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.505
She has come after everything
that matters most.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.131
Cal, the spa, my kids.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.591
-Your kids?
-Kyle.

23:04.674 --> 23:07.552
Most juveniles in his position
would have received a fine.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.180
First-time offender, no alcohol involved.

23:10.263 --> 23:13.141
He's got the support of the family.
He expressed remorse.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.185
What does she have to do
with the sentence though?

23:15.268 --> 23:18.271
She and Trent insisted
that Nellie was disfigured

23:18.355 --> 23:21.691
and emotionally traumatized
by the accident.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.735
-It swayed Judge St. Clair.

23:23.819 --> 23:27.656
I wish the earth would just open up
and swallow the Lewises whole.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.243
Either that or they'd up and move
to Castlewood with Bill.

23:31.326 --> 23:34.287
Hi! How long were you planning
on sitting on that egg?

23:34.955 --> 23:38.417
Listen, outside
from scheduling visits with the kids,

23:38.917 --> 23:41.711
he doesn't cross my mind
all that much anymore. Thank God.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.964
He's going to Pioneer
to head up pediatrics.

23:44.047 --> 23:47.134
-Well, good riddance to bad rubbish.
-That's right, heartbreaker.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.428
Ooh!

23:49.511 --> 23:53.473
I did not want to break his heart!
You know, it kinda broke mine too.

23:53.557 --> 23:54.391
Mm-hmm.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.726
It's just not fair to him.
I have a lot to figure out.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.270
Did you and Jeremy part as friends?

23:59.521 --> 24:01.189
What does this mean for you and Ronnie?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.525
Did I mention
that I have a lot to figure out?

24:04.317 --> 24:07.112
You know, and since we are talking
about awkward relationships,

24:07.195 --> 24:10.490
can I ask how long
Noreen is planning to be in town?

24:10.574 --> 24:11.825
Oh, I don't know.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.704
And I hope one day I won't care.

24:18.915 --> 24:23.253
I would love to have you back, but we are
fully staffed, and I don't need a temp.

24:23.336 --> 24:26.840
I thought as much,
but I figured I'd ask anyway.

24:27.924 --> 24:30.177
If someone needs a day off,
you'll give me a call?

24:30.260 --> 24:31.219
Certainly.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.805
Or, if you need a transcriptionist,

24:33.889 --> 24:36.349
that's how I supported myself
during nursing school.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.269
Would that really interest you?
Genevieve's mom took a fall,

24:39.352 --> 24:42.898
and she's been off for a bit,
so as you can see, we got behind.

24:42.981 --> 24:43.899
I would love to.

24:43.982 --> 24:47.235
Well, hey, it's great to have you back.
Even for a moment, Noreen.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.075
Pastor June asked
if we could add a rainbow to the banner.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.744
Don't look over there.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.207
Uh, what's he doing here?

25:00.290 --> 25:02.709
Well, I don't think he came
to see me or Jesus.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.132
I have work to do.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.512
What exactly is happening here?

25:13.595 --> 25:14.930
No idea.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.935
-Lily. Annie.
-Hey.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.895
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:23.563 --> 25:24.397
What's up?

25:24.481 --> 25:27.150
So many of y'all have been posting
you're volunteering at VBS.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.777
Thought I'd come see what was going on.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.114
I… I didn't come to work.

25:34.574 --> 25:37.160
Oh, um, then why <i>are</i> you here?

25:39.996 --> 25:43.667
When we ran into each other,
I mean, literally ran into each other--

25:43.750 --> 25:46.294
Yeah, that was, uh…
Sorry about that.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.963
No, no, no, don't be. It's just

25:49.172 --> 25:50.549
I keep thinking about it.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.760
I wanted to make sure that you were okay.

25:56.054 --> 25:56.888
I am.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.473
Thanks.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.016
Cool.

26:04.688 --> 26:05.522
Later.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.245
What was that?

26:21.204 --> 26:22.455
I have no idea.

26:26.918 --> 26:30.171
This shuttle arrangement
could be profitable for both of us.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.339
What do you think?

26:32.299 --> 26:36.386
Well, ordinarily, we'd be all for it,
but we've got a few problems of our own.

26:36.469 --> 26:37.596
Parking problems?

26:37.679 --> 26:39.514
Yes! Customers are staying away

26:39.598 --> 26:42.267
because the meals come
with a parking-ticket surprise.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.520
And it's the whole block.
Yesterday Collins came over

26:45.604 --> 26:48.356
all in a lather about what it's doing
to his hardware store.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.734
And Gaynell's hair salon
and Deb's flower shop

26:50.817 --> 26:52.485
are having the same problems
on their block.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.113
I don't suppose you've been encouraged
to buy the old auto shop

26:55.196 --> 26:56.781
and turn it into a parking lot?

26:57.907 --> 27:00.785
Are you two free tonight?
Come by the spa. Talk strategy.

27:00.869 --> 27:01.786
Absolutely.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.913
Fabulous. We'll let the others know too.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.082
Could we bring other folks
who might be interested?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.251
Please do,
and we'll put out an email blast

27:08.335 --> 27:09.836
to all the small business owners.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.839
"In one body, we have many members,"
the Good Book says.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.342
-A united front.
-Amen to that.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.426
-Amen.
-Amen.

27:24.768 --> 27:28.063
-Dude, I rocked that mohawk. Trust me.
-Pics, or it didn't happen.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.649
I would have guessed drummer, not guitar,
but do you still play?

27:30.732 --> 27:33.109
It was a million years ago.
I don't know what I remember.

27:33.193 --> 27:36.321
If I have to listen to you two play,
does it count toward my community service?

27:36.404 --> 27:39.324
Hey! Go back to Atlanta, Coach Useless!

27:41.618 --> 27:42.827
Thanks for watching!

27:43.828 --> 27:45.664
How do you brush that off so easily?

27:46.831 --> 27:47.874
Eh…

27:47.957 --> 27:51.920
"Do what you feel in your heart
to be right. You'll be criticized anyway."

27:52.003 --> 27:54.005
That doesn't sound like you at all.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.091
That's because it's Eleanor Roosevelt.

27:57.092 --> 28:01.012
Remembering what a great person said
helps me to be a better one.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.688
You two doing well enough
for me to take your mom out to dinner?

28:09.771 --> 28:12.065
-Please give us a night without her.
-Yeah, she deserves it.

28:13.441 --> 28:15.735
-Who's reading this?
-Uh, no one, apparently.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.570
Oh.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.197
Washington fascinates me.

28:19.864 --> 28:22.075
Everyone thinks of him
as some refined hero,

28:22.158 --> 28:23.618
but he was a total underdog.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.204
No one expected him to survive,
much less win.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.163
Really?

28:27.997 --> 28:29.457
So how did he win?

28:29.541 --> 28:31.584
Guess we'll have to read the book
to figure that out.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.170
Here. I'll pick up my own copy.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.923
We can read it and compare thoughts.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.675
Yeah. That'd be great.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.009
-Cool.
-All right.

28:40.635 --> 28:43.596
-What are you two talking about?
-George Washington.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.390
Never count out the underdog, Mom.

28:48.727 --> 28:49.561
Hey.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.272
How <i>you</i> doin'?

28:52.772 --> 28:53.690
Ugh.

28:53.773 --> 28:57.610
This scheme of Mary Vaughn
and Trent's is worse than we thought.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.195
So we're gonna have a meeting

28:59.279 --> 29:01.448
with some other business owners
tonight at the spa

29:01.531 --> 29:03.533
to talk about the best way to tackle it.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.161
Oh, you are so sexy…

29:07.412 --> 29:08.580
…when you strategize.

29:10.081 --> 29:14.043
It seems like you're strategizing too,
General Washington.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.962
Oh, you've outflanked me.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.548
The boys gave me permission
to take you out to dinner.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.259
-How's Friday night sound?
-At your service, General.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.594
Mm.

29:53.833 --> 29:55.335
Ronald Sullivan!

29:56.419 --> 29:57.462
Wha…

29:59.380 --> 30:00.340
Whoa.

30:00.882 --> 30:01.716
Ugh!

30:01.800 --> 30:04.010
-How long's that been loose?
-I have lost track.

30:04.093 --> 30:07.138
You are gonna make me
lose my mind and break my neck.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.807
Both are way too fine for that.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.643
What are you thinking?
The neighbors are watching.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.271
I figured…

30:16.481 --> 30:19.275
…you know,
they all watched you throw me out.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.111
They can see you take me back.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.154
Oh!

30:23.238 --> 30:25.156
There more presumption
in the back of that truck?

30:25.240 --> 30:26.157
Not too much.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.827
Mostly apology.

30:29.619 --> 30:30.453
Really?

30:32.413 --> 30:34.916
Listen, Dana Sue, I've come to realize

30:34.999 --> 30:39.420
that I've sat in the passenger seat
for almost 20 years

30:40.129 --> 30:41.464
while you drove our lives.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.758
Don't you dare put all our problems on me.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.303
Oh! No, no, no, no. No.
No, Dana Sue, oh my God…

30:47.846 --> 30:49.222
No blame at all.

30:49.305 --> 30:52.225
Penance and… and gratitude.

30:52.308 --> 30:54.811
You were always so good at everything.
It was just…

30:55.478 --> 30:57.689
It was easy to let you take the lead.

30:57.772 --> 31:01.776
I should have worked to be your partner,

31:01.860 --> 31:05.113
lifting each other higher and higher.

31:07.115 --> 31:10.785
And that is exactly what I will do

31:12.161 --> 31:13.580
if you'll have me back.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.751
It's not this simple.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.672
But I thank you for the show.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.925
And… and for the…

31:27.093 --> 31:28.344
for the flowers.

31:47.780 --> 31:48.615
Hey there.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.325
Hey!

31:51.576 --> 31:53.286
-Thanks for coming in early.
-Yeah.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.371
Mm.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.416
You want me to help set up the chairs?

31:58.499 --> 31:59.417
In a minute.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.464
I know that smile. Tell me.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.010
Helen was here earlier,

32:09.093 --> 32:12.722
and we were talking
about adoption agencies,

32:13.598 --> 32:14.724
and, uh…

32:15.975 --> 32:16.809
And?

32:16.893 --> 32:18.394
I'm not sure I want a baby.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.771
Trotter, I--

32:19.854 --> 32:22.899
I just can't… I can't stop
thinking about the older kids.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.361
The ones that feel
the absence of a family.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.573
You know, that kid
who stands on the lawn every day at dusk,

32:30.657 --> 32:33.034
willing the perfect parents
to drive down the street

32:33.117 --> 32:37.622
because parents who love
and accept them will change their world.

32:38.998 --> 32:40.291
What do you think?

32:41.751 --> 32:43.586
One of the things I love about you

32:44.796 --> 32:46.381
is that you trust your heart.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.468
I trust your heart too.

32:51.219 --> 32:54.055
I think maybe my heart
is hearing someone calling to us.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.765
Then let's go find our child.

32:55.848 --> 32:56.683
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

33:05.858 --> 33:06.693
Hey, Noreen.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.487
Your front yard is beautiful.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.282
I love the bottle tree.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.868
I hope it's okay that I came by.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.204
Yeah, of course. Uh, what brings you over?

33:18.287 --> 33:22.250
I was wondering if the offer for me
to crash here for a bit was still open?

33:22.333 --> 33:23.918
I wouldn't be a nuisance at all.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.379
For sure. It's just
a lot has happened since,

33:26.462 --> 33:28.423
and I'm just trying to get back on track.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.260
It's funny how you think
you're headed one way in life,

33:32.343 --> 33:36.139
and then something happens,
and it's completely turned upside down.

33:36.222 --> 33:38.725
Yeah. Amazing.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.686
Look, I get it. It's no worries at all,

33:41.769 --> 33:45.398
but just promise me
that if you need help, you'll let me know.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.193
Uh, I <i>can</i> think of one thing.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.279
Sure. Say the word.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.448
Would be nice to have
a friendly face around here.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.119
-That's it. Seals the deal.
-Wonderful.

33:58.202 --> 34:02.081
I actually have all my stuff in the car,
so do you mind giving me a hand?

34:02.165 --> 34:03.541
Come on, I got you.

34:06.502 --> 34:08.379
He even brought my favorite flowers.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.884
-I'm practically swooning for you.
-Hmm. So why'd you send him off?

34:13.801 --> 34:16.929
That might've worked when we were dating
or even living together.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.265
It's a whole different thing
when vows are broken.

34:19.348 --> 34:21.517
<i>And</i> a child is involved.

34:21.601 --> 34:25.271
I have to decide
whether to revive a comatose marriage.

34:26.189 --> 34:30.610
You know, that takes more
than just a sweet song and a sexy smile.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.111
Hey.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.780
I thought you were the fire marshal.

34:33.863 --> 34:36.616
You're just about the only ones
within town limits who aren't inside.

34:48.836 --> 34:50.213
Oh, hey, Dana Sue!

34:52.840 --> 34:54.092
Howdy, friends!

34:54.675 --> 34:55.593
Howdy.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.012
Hi.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.265
-Uh, if you call them, they will come.
-Yeah.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.102
I've been collecting emails.
Figured you'd want a way

35:04.185 --> 35:06.979
to keep in touch with everyone.
Make it easier to serve the community.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.941
I can't count all the ways
I am proud to be your mom.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.238
-Hey!
-Hello.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.657
-Reporting for duty, Dana Sue.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.952
Hey. We hear
that you're taking on the Town Council?

35:21.035 --> 35:22.036
-Mm-hmm.
-Sweet.

35:22.120 --> 35:22.995
-Mm-hmm.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.665
You know we're used to
raising our hands for battle.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.875
It is an honor
to have you as part of the charge.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.753
Thank you for the lovely article
on the community garden.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.965
Oh, my pleasure.
I have to do a follow-up when you harvest.

35:38.719 --> 35:42.014
-May we speak?
-I don't wanna give up such a fine seat.

35:42.098 --> 35:44.350
I'll let you know
if I have questions after the meeting.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.936
Peggy. About the other issue.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.689
Helen, I trust your discretion.

35:53.359 --> 35:54.193
Of course.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.039
-Good evening!
-Hmm. There's that mother-of-three voice.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.129
Friends, neighbors,
thank you so much for coming here tonight.

36:13.212 --> 36:16.465
-It seems like we have a lot in common.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.217
Then George Washington said that

36:18.301 --> 36:22.054
"perseverance and spirit
have done wonders in all ages."

36:22.138 --> 36:25.183
-Sounds like something Miss Helen said.
-Maybe she got it from him.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.142
Maybe.

36:26.767 --> 36:29.812
She said, "There are no original thoughts

36:30.688 --> 36:32.690
because everything's been done before,

36:32.773 --> 36:35.568
and it's… it's our job
to find a unique spin."

36:37.236 --> 36:38.321
A unique spin.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.367
-Well, I'm in trouble, then.
-You are not.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.206
Ty, please let me in.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.592
Every summer I can remember
has been about baseball,

37:00.176 --> 37:05.806
and I… I know it sounds lame,
but I feel like I'm… I'm drifting.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.229
Well, I can be your anchor.

37:17.401 --> 37:20.571
Look, there is so much more to you
than the game.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.406
More than you've ever realized.

37:22.907 --> 37:27.995
And I believe in every wonderful,

37:28.913 --> 37:31.290
sweet, smart, handsome bit of you.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.167
I believe in you too.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.296
-Well, I wasn't fishing, so--
-Well, you already caught me.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.756
-Ooh.

37:39.799 --> 37:40.925
Was that too much?

37:41.008 --> 37:41.968
Nope.

37:43.511 --> 37:44.679
No, consider me hooked.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.680
Ah.

37:55.523 --> 37:59.235
Bedrooms are down there,
and if you're looking for the light…

38:00.361 --> 38:01.696
Most random spot ever.

38:02.738 --> 38:06.158
Well, at least it doesn't control
the bathroom light or the hot water.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.493
That's true.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.329
I'm impressed
with how clean your place is.

38:10.413 --> 38:11.539
If my brothers lived alone,

38:11.622 --> 38:13.916
we would've had to have stepped over
three piles of laundry

38:14.000 --> 38:15.710
just to make it through the front door.

38:16.210 --> 38:19.422
I was raised by an accounting professor
and an interior designer,

38:19.505 --> 38:21.632
so neatness was the only option.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.926
-Where'd you grow up?
-Columbus, Ohio.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.595
-A Yankee. What brought you to Serenity?

38:30.516 --> 38:32.226
Um, I need to grab something.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.901
Congratulations, all y'all,
on a very productive night.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.612
I mean, I don't wanna pat ourselves
on the back, but…

38:45.448 --> 38:48.909
I think we came up with
a very strong proposal for Town Council.

38:49.994 --> 38:54.915
And feel free to help yourself to a sweet
at the café, courtesy of the Corner Spa.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.002
Oh, and ladies, this is the perfect time
to sign up for a membership too.

38:58.085 --> 39:00.504
Oh yeah, those, however, are not free.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.049
-Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.051
As long as we're all here, what do you say

39:05.134 --> 39:07.636
we talk about the potholes
over on Queen Road, huh?

39:07.720 --> 39:10.097
Right. One of them
almost took out my rear axle.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.767
-There you go.
-That's not even our biggest problem.

39:12.850 --> 39:16.187
There's a water main out on Briar Patch
that's been leaking for months.

39:16.270 --> 39:19.899
The city tax for those of us
with a home office is ridiculous.

39:20.983 --> 39:22.860
And the fountain over in the park?

39:22.943 --> 39:26.322
It's so run-down that water's squirting
out of its tail instead of its mouth.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.990
All valid complaints

39:28.074 --> 39:31.911
and all old campaign promises of Trent
he hasn't addressed.

39:31.994 --> 39:34.455
-Anyone else have concerns?
-I have one.

39:35.247 --> 39:38.584
When are you gonna start letting
the men in here? This place is nice!

39:40.378 --> 39:42.755
Okay, we'll get to that one in a minute,

39:42.838 --> 39:46.258
but, hey, if there's more
to talk about, let's talk.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.099
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.060
So, what am I supposed
to say to my parents

39:56.143 --> 39:58.312
to convince them
to let me dye my hair blue?

40:00.147 --> 40:03.901
Maybe tell them you could be asking
to dye it bright green.

40:03.984 --> 40:07.738
Yes! Well, what if green
is actually a better choice?

40:08.906 --> 40:11.450
I mean, discuss that
with Billie Eilish.

40:11.534 --> 40:12.576
What's up, y'all?

40:13.244 --> 40:14.829
-Hey, Jackson.
-Hey, Lily.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.416
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Annie, can I borrow you for a sec?

40:31.178 --> 40:35.307
Annie, I wasn't completely honest
with you this morning.

40:35.391 --> 40:39.186
There's another reason
I just can't stop thinking about you.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.522
You have every right not to trust me.

40:43.065 --> 40:48.612
I messed with you to get at someone else,
which was stupid. Terrible.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.531
But you still stood up for me

40:50.614 --> 40:53.325
even when everyone
was throwing me under the bus,

40:54.076 --> 40:56.537
and I still didn't say the right things.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.498
So let me say them now.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.793
I'm not sure which is more important,

41:02.877 --> 41:06.922
but I think "I'm sorry" comes first,

41:07.006 --> 41:10.342
and "thank you" comes right behind it.

41:12.553 --> 41:15.681
I… …appreciate both.

41:15.764 --> 41:20.102
I never took the time to notice
how special you are until now,

41:20.186 --> 41:22.605
and I can tell there's so much more.

41:22.688 --> 41:26.025
If you could see your way clear
to getting to know me better too,

41:26.108 --> 41:28.569
I think we might wind up
having a good time.

41:29.570 --> 41:32.656
-I think you might be right.
-Any chance we could start fresh?

41:33.616 --> 41:36.368
-It would be nice if we could be friends.
-Okay.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.787
Then we'll go from there.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.832
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.209
Good seeing you.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.212
-Take care.
-Yeah, the whole town came together.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.671
Good night, ladies.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.756
-Bye!
-Good night.

41:50.257 --> 41:52.801
Phenomenal in every way.

41:53.302 --> 41:56.555
An extraordinary event, hmm?

41:56.639 --> 41:59.391
-That was wonderful, Helen.
-Aw.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.935
Congratulations, and thank you.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.729
Much appreciated, Ashley.
Thanks for joining us.

42:03.812 --> 42:06.815
Helen, the last guests have gone,
place is straightened up,

42:06.899 --> 42:10.152
and first thing tomorrow,
we'll be working out bodies and minds.

42:10.236 --> 42:14.281
Hmm. <i>You</i> are a saint, Trotter.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.201
Would a saint be on the way
to Sullivan's for ice cream?

42:19.495 --> 42:20.788
-Good night!
-Good night!

42:24.500 --> 42:26.627
You are a remarkable woman.

42:30.714 --> 42:34.343
Everything you've been going through,
and yet here you are.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.807
I am surrounded and supported by a…

42:40.558 --> 42:42.768
by a powerful circle of friends.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.358
Hey. Sit.

42:50.943 --> 42:51.944
You know, it's…

42:53.195 --> 42:57.908
it's inspiring to see how you,
Maddie, and Dana Sue come together.

42:58.450 --> 43:00.911
-Hmm.
-As partners and as friends.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.539
Well, they're even more than that.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.418
They're my sisters.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.421
Hmm, but not only them.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.049
I came through this

43:15.092 --> 43:16.385
because of Maddie,

43:17.303 --> 43:18.304
Dana Sue…

43:20.598 --> 43:21.432
and you.

43:22.474 --> 43:23.767
Hmm.

43:47.791 --> 43:48.667
Wow!

43:50.878 --> 43:53.672
I haven't been up here
in I don't know how long.

43:53.756 --> 43:55.924
Dana Sue made me come up here.

43:56.008 --> 43:58.969
-What for?
-To get a different view of our neighbors.

43:59.053 --> 44:01.847
To think about ways
to woo our local diners.

44:01.930 --> 44:04.308
I'm pretty sure she was just trying
to get me out the kitchen.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.477
Oh, no.
She can be very territorial.

44:08.145 --> 44:10.022
In our tree house when we were little,

44:10.105 --> 44:13.484
she was the only one allowed
to set a menu for our imaginary meals.

44:14.526 --> 44:18.489
Huh. So my summer menu series…

44:18.572 --> 44:19.948
That's not gonna happen.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.534
-Thank you for the warning.

44:22.618 --> 44:25.663
Uh, but partnership
still has its privileges,

44:25.746 --> 44:29.541
like access to up here
and the best bubbly.

44:30.084 --> 44:30.918
Shall we?

44:34.296 --> 44:35.673
How do you have time for all this?

44:35.756 --> 44:39.176
I have been thinking about this
since I first came up here.

44:49.728 --> 44:53.190
Dana Sue also said
that when the moon is bright…

44:53.273 --> 44:54.108
Hmm.

44:54.191 --> 44:57.861
…magnolias sparkle and shine like stars.

44:58.362 --> 45:01.532
And you were an absolute star tonight.

45:05.494 --> 45:08.288
I thought it was time
to bring you up here to see some more.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.749
Do you think wishing on a star works?

45:14.253 --> 45:15.212
Can't hurt.

45:16.880 --> 45:17.881
What's your wish?

45:24.513 --> 45:25.514
I wish…

45:28.016 --> 45:29.852
that everyone in the world

45:31.061 --> 45:32.479
has a moment like this.

45:35.983 --> 45:37.317
Filled with gratitude…

45:40.612 --> 45:42.030
with someone they love.

46:01.717 --> 46:02.718
I love you, Cal.

46:06.388 --> 46:07.681
I love you too, Maddie.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.073
Annie?

47:06.698 --> 47:07.741
I'm home!

47:08.909 --> 47:11.870
<i>She's</i> not. She's out with her friends.

47:12.663 --> 47:13.914
What are you doing here?

47:14.790 --> 47:18.126
Sorry I missed the big meeting at the spa.
How'd that go?

47:19.044 --> 47:20.462
Great, thank you.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.549
You're not answering my question.

47:23.632 --> 47:27.886
Got to worrying
about that loose handrail, so I fixed it.

47:27.970 --> 47:30.430
Noticed that. Appreciate it.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.812
Oh my, my.

47:37.521 --> 47:40.524
-Thank you for that too.
-Rehinged the back screen door.

47:40.607 --> 47:44.278
The one you were gonna get around to
three years ago?

47:44.361 --> 47:45.863
Bathroom drain was slow.

47:46.864 --> 47:47.698
Cleared it.

47:48.740 --> 47:51.326
Picture of Annie leaning against the wall,

47:52.995 --> 47:53.829
hung it.

47:55.956 --> 47:57.082
Babe, I know

47:58.500 --> 48:01.211
I can't fix all the ways I broke our home,

48:01.295 --> 48:04.256
but the least I can do is fix our house.

48:08.510 --> 48:12.097
I want to make
our today and tomorrow better

48:12.681 --> 48:17.311
and strive each and every day
to deserve your forgiveness…

48:19.897 --> 48:21.023
and your love.
