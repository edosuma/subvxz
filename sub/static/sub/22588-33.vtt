Yes, sir.
Can I help you?

00:54.776 --> 00:58.778
- Fresh fish today.
- Well, that depends.

00:58.780 --> 01:01.714
I, uh,
ran across this handbill

01:01.716 --> 01:05.117
advertising uh,
cut rate caviar.

01:05.119 --> 01:07.486
Ooh, yes, sir.

01:07.488 --> 01:08.587
Right this way.

01:08.589 --> 01:10.188
- The best in town.
- So I hope.

01:10.190 --> 01:13.524
I should never commit myself to
serve anything but the best.

01:13.526 --> 01:16.560
How much ya need?
A couple of ounces?

01:16.562 --> 01:17.827
Half a pound?

01:17.829 --> 01:19.728
20 pounds at least,
my good man.

01:19.730 --> 01:23.898
A pound per guest.
Now, uh, pardon me, ladies.

01:32.973 --> 01:34.640
Mmm, very mild.

01:34.642 --> 01:37.676
Now if it's all
as good as this..

01:37.678 --> 01:40.912
Why, what's
the meaning of this?

01:40.914 --> 01:44.248
'Help! Police!
Help! Help!'

01:44.250 --> 01:47.718
Help! Help!
My face!

01:52.990 --> 01:55.591
'Yes, commissioner.'

01:55.593 --> 01:59.595
Not only did some passers by
see Alfred, the Wayne butler

01:59.597 --> 02:02.998
being carried to
a waitin' car by hoodlums

02:03.000 --> 02:04.632
but the hoodlums
had umbrellas.

02:04.634 --> 02:06.634
We found this one
at the scene.

02:06.636 --> 02:09.970
- Notice what's on the tip.
- Hmm?

02:10.104 --> 02:13.906
- Mmm, smells like caviar.
- Hmm.

02:15.642 --> 02:17.676
There's no doubt,
commissioner.

02:17.678 --> 02:20.045
No doubt or
me name ain't..

02:20.047 --> 02:22.047
- O'Hara.
- Chief O'Hara.

02:22.049 --> 02:22.914
That's right.

02:22.916 --> 02:24.815
Umbrella is
the absolute sign..

02:24.817 --> 02:28.084
...we're dealing with that
waddling, pirate o' plunder

02:28.086 --> 02:29.985
the Penguin himself.

02:29.987 --> 02:33.121
Or...do we deal with him?

02:33.622 --> 02:36.190
Ya hit the nail right
on the head, commissioner.

02:36.192 --> 02:39.226
Oh, any ordinary crook,
the department can handle.

02:39.228 --> 02:42.229
But when it comes to
the likes of the Penguin..

02:42.231 --> 02:46.066
...why there's only
one being on earth.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.006
Yes, commissioner.
What is it?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.942
Uh, thank heavens
I got you, Batman.

02:57.944 --> 03:00.277
It's-it's the Penguin again.

03:00.279 --> 03:02.746
- A kidnapping.
- The Penguin, eh?

03:02.748 --> 03:05.215
- Who's his victim this time?
- Uh, Batman.

03:05.217 --> 03:08.551
You know Bruce Wayne,
the multimillionaire of course.

03:08.553 --> 03:09.051
Of course.

03:09.053 --> 03:11.053
'The Penguin's
victim is none other than'

03:11.055 --> 03:13.588
'Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred.'

03:13.590 --> 03:17.058
Batman, are you there?
Di-did you hear me?

03:18.260 --> 03:22.696
Yes, I heard you, commissioner.
We'll join you at once.

03:22.698 --> 03:23.563
Who is it, Bruce?

03:23.565 --> 03:24.931
Has the Penguin kidnapped
someone special?

03:24.933 --> 03:30.836
Dick, I'm afraid you better put
your Latin verbs aside for now.

03:30.838 --> 03:33.772
- The missing man is Alfred.
- Holy Wayne manor!

03:33.774 --> 03:36.174
- You don't mean our Alfred.
- Yes, Dick.

03:36.176 --> 03:38.476
I mean our Alfred.

It does indeed
point to Penguin.

05:28.408 --> 05:33.177
Chief O'Hara, I congratulate
you on your keen deduction.

05:33.179 --> 05:35.179
Hmm? Oh-oh,
it was nothing.

05:35.181 --> 05:39.716
But what troubles me is what
them hoodlums did with Alfred.

05:39.718 --> 05:41.884
They obviously
took him somewhere.

05:41.886 --> 05:43.819
- Hmm.
- Very strange.

05:43.821 --> 05:44.986
What is, Robin?

05:44.988 --> 05:46.087
I'm sure
you've noticed, Batman.

05:46.089 --> 05:48.255
Alfred the butler
has been kidnapped

05:48.257 --> 05:49.823
but there's no ransom demand.

05:49.825 --> 05:52.692
My thunderation!
The lad is right.

05:52.694 --> 05:56.362
But, if it wasn't ransom that
the Penguin's after, what then?

05:56.364 --> 05:58.797
I think I can answer that,
Chief O'Hara.

05:58.799 --> 06:03.134
The multimillionaire's
annual award dinner.

06:03.136 --> 06:05.369
You mean the one at which
a dozen multimillionaires

06:05.371 --> 06:08.205
each donate a million dollars
cash to a chosen charity?

06:08.207 --> 06:11.775
What does Alfred the butler
have to do with that?

06:11.777 --> 06:12.976
It's not common knowledge

06:12.978 --> 06:16.346
but Alfred is the major domo
at that affair..

06:16.348 --> 06:19.882
...and I happen to know that
his employer Mr. Bruce Wayne

06:19.884 --> 06:22.217
attends that
dinner every year.

06:22.219 --> 06:26.020
Batman, the location is kept
secret to avoid publicity.

06:26.022 --> 06:27.855
The only ones who know..

06:27.857 --> 06:31.091
- Oh!
- Big pardon, boy wonder.

06:31.093 --> 06:33.426
If Alfred oversees
the food and service

06:33.428 --> 06:36.495
he knows where it's held.
And that means..

06:36.497 --> 06:38.096
'Exactly, Robin.'

06:38.098 --> 06:39.764
That's what
the Penguin is after.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.266
He kidnapped Alfred
to force him to divulge

06:42.268 --> 06:44.167
the location of the dinner.

06:44.169 --> 06:45.434
Good thinking, Robin.

06:45.436 --> 06:49.004
And $12 million is nothing to
sneeze at, even for Penguin.

06:49.006 --> 06:52.807
Come on, Robin. Let's race to
the scene of the kidnapping.

06:52.809 --> 06:53.474
We may find a clue.

06:53.476 --> 06:56.276
'But, Batman.
The fish store is empty.'

06:56.278 --> 06:57.744
It's-it's
a false fish store.

06:57.746 --> 07:01.748
That's right. We checked it
over from stem to stern.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.449
Meaning no offence,
Chief O'Hara.

07:03.451 --> 07:06.251
Your department is
the finest in the land.

07:06.253 --> 07:09.053
But...where you failed..

07:09.055 --> 07:12.322
...Robin and I may succeed.

07:16.393 --> 07:18.394
Ah! The dynamic duo.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.462
What would we
do without them, O'Hara?

07:20.464 --> 07:23.131
Oh, commissioner.
Don't even whisper it.

07:23.133 --> 07:25.833
Oh, I shudder to
think of what might..

07:25.835 --> 07:27.534
Uh-oh! I'm forgetting.

07:27.536 --> 07:32.472
Parking lot, clear
all exits for the Batmobile.

07:34.074 --> 07:39.344
<i> And meanwhile</i>
<i> on Gotham City's waterfront..</i>

07:39.346 --> 07:42.513
<i> ...the riverside rendezvous</i>
<i> of the Penguin</i>

07:42.515 --> 07:46.049
<i> and his fine finny fiends.</i>

07:46.984 --> 07:50.286
<i> Seagoing scoundrels, all.</i>

08:05.968 --> 08:10.304
- Octopus, more ink.
- Coming, boss.

08:16.177 --> 08:17.877
What do you think,
Penguin poopsy?

08:17.879 --> 08:22.815
It's lovely, Finella,
my little pollywog, lovely.

08:22.817 --> 08:24.483
You are not even looking.

08:24.485 --> 08:27.185
You told me to practice
and you'd make sure

08:27.187 --> 08:29.187
that I won a bathing
beauty contest.

08:29.189 --> 08:30.988
You will,
I'll see to that.

08:30.990 --> 08:34.825
It's all part and parcel
of my piratical plan.

08:36.595 --> 08:38.094
But that'll come later.

08:38.096 --> 08:41.330
Right now, I have
other fish to fry.

08:41.332 --> 08:43.866
Stop it, you ruffian.
Don't do that.

08:43.868 --> 08:45.333
Talk. Where's this here

08:45.335 --> 08:48.602
multimillionaire dinner
gonna be held?

08:48.604 --> 08:51.571
Maybe I oughta
run this through you.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.240
Nay!
You mineral brain.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.874
But, boss.
I gotta make him tell.

08:55.876 --> 09:00.245
'Tell what? He can't tell
what he doesn't know.'

09:00.247 --> 09:02.880
- Doesn't know?
- Quite true.

09:02.882 --> 09:03.547
I do not know.

09:03.549 --> 09:05.982
And not that I'd
tell you if I did.

09:05.984 --> 09:08.918
But, boss, if he don't have
the answer, what good is he?

09:08.920 --> 09:13.589
Ugh! You don't comprehend
my super calculated trickery.

09:13.591 --> 09:15.891
But you will.

09:20.262 --> 09:23.063
And so will you,
Alfred, my boy.

09:23.065 --> 09:27.267
When I put you in
the penguin box.

09:28.937 --> 09:35.141
And I'll teach you how
to waddle like a Penguin.

09:39.946 --> 09:42.180
You're quite right.
It's no secret now.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.516
Because the location of the
dinner hasn't been decided upon.

09:45.518 --> 09:50.254
But when it has, you won't
be a silent butler anymore.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.955
You'll be
a babbling butler.

09:51.957 --> 09:56.359
Never, it simply isn't done
to betray one's master.

09:56.361 --> 09:57.560
Exactly, exactly.

09:57.562 --> 10:01.530
And this penguin box
will make me your master.

10:01.532 --> 10:04.900
- Everything ready?
- 'All set, boss.'

10:39.168 --> 10:41.636
Switch.

10:50.411 --> 10:54.414
Hey, zombie stuff.
He's brainwashed.

10:54.416 --> 10:56.048
Precisely.

10:56.050 --> 10:59.151
As I say, my penguin box
never fails.

10:59.153 --> 11:01.319
He's coming under my power.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.454
Now watch.

11:08.259 --> 11:11.226
You will remember
none of this.

11:11.228 --> 11:13.561
"I will remember
none of this."

11:13.563 --> 11:15.863
What you will remember is..

11:17.032 --> 11:18.231
...the time..

11:18.233 --> 11:19.899
"...The time.."

11:19.901 --> 11:21.200
'...and the place..'

11:21.202 --> 11:22.034
"And the place.."

11:22.036 --> 11:25.804
...of the multimillionaires
dinner.

11:26.339 --> 11:28.972
"...of the multimillionaires
dinner."

11:28.974 --> 11:31.240
- Is that clear?
- 'Yes.'

11:31.242 --> 11:35.277
- Yes what?
- Yes..

11:35.279 --> 11:36.344
...sir.

11:52.961 --> 11:54.361
Only a smear of caviar.

11:54.663 --> 11:58.831
Chief O'Hara was right.
Not a clue in sight.

11:59.299 --> 12:03.669
What's that on the floor, Robin?
That crumpled piece of paper.

12:05.839 --> 12:08.407
Just an ad for this place.

12:08.941 --> 12:12.977
"Big sale, cut-rate caviar.
First come, first served."

12:13.379 --> 12:17.214
'Look closer. The name
of the proprietor.'

12:17.216 --> 12:19.716
'"Not A Fish."'

12:20.050 --> 12:22.217
- Not a fish?
- Don't you see, Robin?

12:22.219 --> 12:24.586
- If he's <i> not a fish--</i>
- Of course!

12:24.588 --> 12:28.790
Holy subliminal! If he's not
a fish, he must be the Penguin.

12:28.792 --> 12:30.758
Exactly!
Good deduction.

12:31.660 --> 12:34.060
The bat-phone
in the Batmobile.

12:38.098 --> 12:42.167
Remember, Robin,
always look both ways.

12:43.469 --> 12:44.068
Yes?

12:44.570 --> 12:47.170
'This is Commissioner Gordon,
Batman.'

12:47.172 --> 12:50.106
- What's wrong, commissioner?
- Not a thing, Batman.

12:50.108 --> 12:53.275
For once I'm happy to say
I'm the bearer of good news.

12:53.277 --> 12:56.244
I'm happy to tell you that
Mr. Wayne's butler Alfred

12:56.246 --> 12:57.845
has not been kidnapped
after all.

12:57.847 --> 13:00.113
Not kidnapped?
What does he mean, Batman?

13:00.115 --> 13:02.915
I heard that, boy wonder.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.717
I mean, he has
not been kidnapped.

13:05.719 --> 13:08.352
Alfred the butler
has turned up?

13:08.354 --> 13:09.820
Safe and sound
as a dollar.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.054
Ahem! And you'll
never guess where.

13:11.056 --> 13:14.624
Right back home at the stately
mansion of his employer

13:14.626 --> 13:15.758
millionaire Bruce Wayne.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.894
Thank you, commissioner.
That's good news.

13:19.028 --> 13:21.929
Holy puzzlers, Batman!
It's great that Alfred is safe.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.998
But...somehow
it sounds fishy to me.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.132
It certainly does, Robin.

13:26.134 --> 13:28.000
And the sooner we
talk to Alfred ourselves

13:28.002 --> 13:31.870
the sooner we'll have
the answers. Let's go.

13:43.581 --> 13:45.682
But of course
I smell fishy, sir.

13:45.684 --> 13:47.950
One does not purchase
20 pounds of caviar

13:47.952 --> 13:52.521
without retaining a certain
effluvium of fish eggs.

13:52.523 --> 13:54.890
I had to hang out
my morning coat to air.

13:54.892 --> 13:58.727
But, Alfred, you were
reported kidnapped.

13:58.861 --> 14:02.430
We just came from the fish store
where they grabbed you.

14:02.432 --> 14:04.799
Fish store?
What fish store?

14:04.801 --> 14:08.402
The one you went to,
to purchase the caviar.

14:08.404 --> 14:10.704
I never went to
any fish store, sir.

14:10.706 --> 14:11.604
I did as I always do.

14:11.606 --> 14:14.473
Purchased it direct through
the Iranian embassy.

14:14.475 --> 14:17.542
Why? Is anything
the matter, sir?

14:18.611 --> 14:21.545
- Where did you get that twitch?
- Get what, sir?

14:21.547 --> 14:25.115
- That...twitch.
- Twitch, sir?

14:25.117 --> 14:27.717
What twitch?

14:30.721 --> 14:33.489
We'll never learn where
the Penguin took him this way.

14:33.491 --> 14:38.093
Patience, there's more than
one way to locate a criminal.

14:38.761 --> 14:42.196
Let's try the memory
bat-bank on Alfred.

14:42.198 --> 14:43.530
Good idea.

14:43.532 --> 14:45.498
- Alfred.
- Mm-hmm?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.967
Would you like to
look at some photographs

14:47.969 --> 14:49.569
to see if you recognize
some people?

14:49.571 --> 14:52.371
Photos? Oh, gladly, sir.

14:56.576 --> 14:58.143
Yes.

14:59.444 --> 15:03.914
'A criminal type, sir,
obviously. And a smooth one.'

15:03.916 --> 15:05.682
They can be
the most dangerous.

15:05.684 --> 15:10.553
- But not familiar.
- No, sir. A total stranger.

15:12.455 --> 15:15.857
'Also a total stranger.
And I may add.'

15:15.859 --> 15:18.559
'I'm glad of it.'

15:19.060 --> 15:22.829
Shark, hmm.
An interesting appellation.

15:22.831 --> 15:26.132
- But you don't know him?
- No.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.868
Never seen him before, sir.

15:32.372 --> 15:35.140
'A rogue, if ever I saw one.'

15:35.142 --> 15:38.143
Eh, but this is
my first glimpse of him.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.345
Now, Alfred..

15:40.347 --> 15:42.413
...how about..

15:42.415 --> 15:44.014
...this one?

15:44.616 --> 15:48.784
'Oh, a fiend, sir.
Obviously, a perfect fiend.'

15:48.786 --> 15:51.453
Uh, may one enquire
as to his name?

15:51.455 --> 15:53.388
His name..

15:53.390 --> 15:54.555
...is Penguin.

15:54.557 --> 15:58.559
Penguin, hmm.
Never seen him before, sir.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.695
Oh, uh, excuse me, sir.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.730
This is all most
interesting but, uh..

16:05.732 --> 16:08.365
In a few minutes
your guests will be here.

16:08.367 --> 16:11.234
- Guests?
- Yes, Master Robin.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.601
The multimillionaires.

16:12.603 --> 16:14.936
Alfred's right. The rehearsal
dinner, we must be there.

16:14.938 --> 16:17.872
If we're not, it would be
breach of good manners.

16:17.874 --> 16:19.306
Thank you for
remembering, Alfred.

16:19.308 --> 16:22.776
Thank you, sir.
A good butler never forgets.

16:22.778 --> 16:24.277
Oh, the crabmeat canapes.

16:24.279 --> 16:27.780
I must pop them in
the oven right away.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.228
Good idea, this rehearsal.

16:44.230 --> 16:47.631
The ladies are
such worthy causes.

16:48.566 --> 16:51.367
I personally
favor Miss, uh..

16:51.369 --> 16:53.402
...Natural Resources.

16:53.404 --> 16:56.705
I'd like to make her
my own personal charity.

16:56.707 --> 16:57.972
All are worthy.

16:57.974 --> 16:59.873
Uh, you can
say that again.

16:59.875 --> 17:03.376
And that is Bruce Wayne's
grandfather, Mrs. Cooper?

17:03.378 --> 17:05.310
His great grandfather.

17:05.313 --> 17:08.280
I understand he was tapped
for skull and bones.

17:08.281 --> 17:13.818
Tapped for it? Sir,
he founded skull and bones.

17:14.553 --> 17:17.755
- Uh, canape, miss?
- Oh, no, thank you.

17:17.757 --> 17:20.390
I have to watch my figure.

17:20.392 --> 17:22.825
I quite understand.

17:22.827 --> 17:24.827
How do we decide
where we have dinner?

17:24.829 --> 17:27.663
By vote as usual in
the democratic way.

17:27.665 --> 17:31.433
- Uh, canapes, sir?
- Don't mind if I do.

17:33.369 --> 17:35.436
Hey, what's this?

17:37.573 --> 17:38.905
A fish hook.

17:38.907 --> 17:39.772
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

17:39.774 --> 17:42.341
It must have fallen
out of my morning coat.

17:42.343 --> 17:43.608
- Your morning coat?
- Uh, yes, sir.

17:43.610 --> 17:48.546
The one I wore this morning when
I was preparing the canapes.

17:48.548 --> 17:49.747
Excuse me a moment.

17:49.749 --> 17:52.049
Sir, please do have another.
I can assure you..

17:52.451 --> 17:54.618
Fallen from his morning coat.
The one he wore.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.753
Yes, this morning when
the Penguin grabbed him.

17:56.755 --> 18:01.491
A clue, Dick.
Quickly, back to the bat-cave.

18:05.563 --> 18:09.031
A fish hook.
Clearly that must mean..

18:11.801 --> 18:12.867
'...a water front.'

18:12.869 --> 18:14.535
'Holy fog! Of course.'

18:14.537 --> 18:17.738
Where on the waterfront?
It runs for a 146 miles.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.906
You're forgetting
the other clue, Robin.

18:19.908 --> 18:21.574
"Not a fish" proprietor.

18:21.576 --> 18:26.378
Let's see if the same name
pops up for a fishing pier.

18:27.780 --> 18:30.381
'No.'

18:32.317 --> 18:33.917
'"A fish."
That's it!'

18:33.919 --> 18:37.053
'South Pier.
Let's go!'

18:38.955 --> 18:41.756
Gosh, Batman.
It just occurred to me.

18:41.758 --> 18:44.658
What if Penguin's
prepared for us?

18:44.660 --> 18:46.793
- I hope he's not.
- But if he is?

18:46.795 --> 18:49.829
That's a chance
we have to take, Robin.

19:06.379 --> 19:09.981
We waitin' for
somebody, boss?

19:11.117 --> 19:14.618
- Boss, it's the Batmobile.
- Yes!

19:14.620 --> 19:15.585
Batman and Robin.

19:15.587 --> 19:18.521
I knew that that
fish hook would fetch them.

19:18.523 --> 19:22.825
- You knew?
- You mean

19:27.897 --> 19:30.298
Th-th-they'll grab us.
It's the finish.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.434
The finish for them,
not for us, my quaking cohorts.

19:33.436 --> 19:36.838
But they're not captured yet.
If I may coin a phrase

19:36.840 --> 19:40.008
there's many a slip,
so zipper your lip.

19:42.378 --> 19:45.313
Here they come.
Inside.

19:52.854 --> 19:55.555
Out of sight.

20:00.092 --> 20:01.859
Finella,
what're you doing?

20:01.861 --> 20:03.793
Gee! Batman is handsome.

20:03.795 --> 20:05.694
What I can make out
under the mask.

20:05.696 --> 20:09.931
What you can make, my dear,
is make yourself scarce!

20:21.175 --> 20:24.310
You may as well give
yourself up, Penguin.

20:28.047 --> 20:30.982
Will you close
your gills?

20:50.699 --> 20:53.834
Holy clockwork!
What next?

20:54.302 --> 20:56.936
It proves he's here.

20:57.904 --> 21:00.171
Come on, Robin.

21:12.952 --> 21:15.185
Where is he?

21:36.004 --> 21:38.972
Pengy-baby,
I'm just not sure that

21:38.974 --> 21:41.941
this is the right
bathing suit.

22:28.119 --> 22:28.785
No!

22:29.487 --> 22:32.488
Look, boss,
they're still breathing.

22:33.323 --> 22:34.523
So, they are, eh?

22:34.525 --> 22:37.092
We'll remedy that
by putting them in the..

22:38.095 --> 22:38.827
...vacuum tank.

22:38.829 --> 22:41.596
Not the vacuum tank, boss.
It ain't human.

22:41.598 --> 22:42.763
Hmm, no-no, it ain't.

22:42.765 --> 22:45.432
Well, come on,
you mutt headed finks.

22:45.434 --> 22:47.667
Follow me.

23:03.649 --> 23:06.784
Greetings, dynamic duo.

23:20.331 --> 23:22.799
'"Enough for all."
But not for long.'

23:22.801 --> 23:26.636
Come on, you finny finks.
Keep the bellows working.

23:26.638 --> 23:27.670
'Oh, how awful.'

23:28.172 --> 23:31.239
Yes, isn't it?
Hand me that.

23:32.274 --> 23:35.142
Wake up, caped-crusader.

23:35.476 --> 23:39.178
Yes, Batman.
The air is growing thinner.

23:39.180 --> 23:43.182
'And as it does the balloons
will begin to expand and burst.'

23:43.184 --> 23:46.318
'So you watch
the balloons Batman.'

23:46.320 --> 23:48.086
'When all of
them have burst'

23:48.088 --> 23:50.922
'the two of you
will be finished.'

23:56.028 --> 24:00.397
<i> Can this be happening</i>
<i> to the dynamic duo?</i>

24:02.967 --> 24:04.233
<i> How can they live?</i>

24:04.235 --> 24:08.370
<i> Will they be vanquished</i>
<i> by a vacuum?</i>

24:10.239 --> 24:13.507
<i> Revive, Robin!</i>
<i> Breathe Batman!</i>

24:13.509 --> 24:18.211
<i> We'll hold our breath</i>
<i> for you both.</i>

24:20.147 --> 24:21.580
<i> Until tomorrow night.</i>

24:21.582 --> 24:25.183
<i> Same time,</i>
<i> same channel.</i>
