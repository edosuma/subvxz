00:33.208 --> 00:35.125
Are you wasting my time,
Bourdette?

00:36.625 --> 00:38.292
Are you wasting my time?

00:38.667 --> 00:41.125
If they find out
I'm talking to you, they'll

00:42.667 --> 00:44.000
they'll kill me.

00:45.417 --> 00:47.125
Tell me how it works.

00:50.292 --> 00:51.292
No, this is...

00:51.708 --> 00:53.458
- this is wrong. This is insane.
- Whoa, whoa.

00:53.875 --> 00:55.167
You're doing the right thing

00:55.458 --> 00:57.917
the brave thing.
Please sit down.

01:04.958 --> 01:07.250
What does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?

01:47.500 --> 01:48.583
Stop!

02:46.625 --> 02:47.958
Thank you.

02:49.458 --> 02:52.208
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.083
So where are we five years from now?

03:00.500 --> 03:05.708
Right here at the Lafitte Hotel except
we have a babysitter at home.

03:06.333 --> 03:07.250
I like that.

03:07.583 --> 03:09.458
- Me too.
- A babysitter

03:10.000 --> 03:13.292
blond, about 19 Swedish

03:13.833 --> 03:15.292
and he's very handsome.

03:15.792 --> 03:17.125
Don't fuck with me.

03:18.208 --> 03:22.125
Plunge to his death today off the roof
of a parking structure on Burgundy Street.

03:22.375 --> 03:25.083
- We're going live to the scene.
- It's where I parked my car.

03:25.208 --> 03:27.125
Joining me is Lieutenant Durgan
with the NOPD.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.208
You think we have a murder victim here?

03:29.417 --> 03:32.417
I'm not gonna comment at this time
but I will tell you that NOPD

03:32.750 --> 03:34.125
is gonna do everything in its power

03:34.292 --> 03:36.250
- to get to the bottom of this.
- Yeah, right, another unsolved case.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.458
- I know what's happening.
- It's New Orleans.

03:38.875 --> 03:41.333
- The city's going in hell.
- Oh, come on, we love New Orleans.

03:41.917 --> 03:42.875
Who dat?

03:43.292 --> 03:46.667
Well, the city may be going to hell
but we are going dancing.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.250
That's right.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.208
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

04:11.458 --> 04:12.583
How did you two meet?

04:13.042 --> 04:15.167
I'll bet it was really juicy and romantic.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.458
- No, not really.
- I thought it was.

04:18.916 --> 04:19.458
Well...

04:19.875 --> 04:22.917
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop. It's a "well"?

04:26.000 --> 04:27.083
I know it's a "well".

04:27.583 --> 04:31.125
Oh, he was sitting with all these kids
like, 14-15 year olds.

04:31.417 --> 04:33.792
Their first time at Symphony
you could tell.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.292
- And they were actually listening.
- One or two of them.

04:36.417 --> 04:39.083
You know I just thought it was incredible
what he was doing for those kids.

04:39.250 --> 04:42.167
Bullshit! Those, no, listen,
those kids were juvenile delinquents.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.958
They were supposed to be in detention

04:44.208 --> 04:46.625
and Will was supposed
to supervise but instead

04:47.042 --> 04:49.167
this son of a bitch uses his own
hard-earned cash

04:49.458 --> 04:50.542
to take them to a concert.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.000
- They are my students.
- Of course, you do.

04:53.708 --> 04:55.125
Some bad ass kids.

04:59.792 --> 05:03.292
Oh, it's not "Ow!". It's Aaaw!

05:32.833 --> 05:34.125
- What? ...What?
- Close your eyes.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.625
Where are you going?

05:36.292 --> 05:37.000
Don't look at me.

05:37.208 --> 05:39.000
- Come back.
- Close your eyes.

05:39.958 --> 05:42.083
Close your eyes.
Tight.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.583
Okay.

05:45.708 --> 05:46.958
Put out your hands.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.667
What are you going to do?

05:50.167 --> 05:51.667
Unspeakable things.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.667
Happy anniversary.

06:00.625 --> 06:01.625
Oh...

06:02.292 --> 06:03.708
It's beautiful.

06:04.667 --> 06:06.458
I didn't think
you've gotten me anything.

06:08.125 --> 06:09.958
Of course, I got you something.

06:10.292 --> 06:11.917
They're little rubies.

06:18.583 --> 06:19.542
Thank you.

06:20.333 --> 06:21.333
I love you.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.917
One at a time, please.
One at a time.

06:31.583 --> 06:35.417
Phone, beepers, knives, guns.
If it rings hand it.

06:36.125 --> 06:36.875
Hand over the phone, Edwin.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.458
- What phone? I'm clean.
- And the beeping is?

06:40.625 --> 06:42.042
- Thank you. Mr. Will.
- Mr. Jimmy.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.875
- Hey, are we still on for tonight?
- You're going down.

06:45.042 --> 06:46.125
Keep dreaming.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.333
Remember if your phone to school,
your parents...

06:48.625 --> 06:52.458
The expense of spirit in a waste
of shame is lust in action.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.958
And till action, lust is perjured

06:55.333 --> 07:00.250
murderous, bloody, full of blame
savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust.

07:00.583 --> 07:04.667
You see what Shakespeare's doing here?
He's using words to create emotions.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.083
What kind of words are these?

07:06.708 --> 07:09.083
They're violent words.
And why is this important?

07:09.583 --> 07:12.000
Because when you feel angry, when you
wanna punch somebody in the face

07:12.375 --> 07:13.917
you put it on paper instead.

07:14.042 --> 07:18.167
You find words that evoke emotions in you
and you do something positive with it.

07:18.625 --> 07:19.500
Edwin.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.667
I could have sworn I saw the principal
take the phone from you this morning.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.167
Guess what?

07:26.500 --> 07:30.417
If you applied yourself half as much to
class as you do to scamming the school

07:30.833 --> 07:32.417
you could accomplish anything.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.125
Ready to suffer?

08:06.792 --> 08:07.917
Bring it on.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.917
- Thank you.
- I'll see you. / I'll see you.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.417
I'm this way.

08:36.832 --> 08:38.292
- Goodnight.
- Bye. / Bye.

09:18.583 --> 09:20.458
Bitch, huh?

09:22.375 --> 09:23.375
Get in!

09:34.625 --> 09:35.625
Really.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.667
Check mate and mate, mate.

09:40.167 --> 09:41.625
I didn't see that coming.

09:42.292 --> 09:44.125
Yo, your problem,
my man, is you play it too safe.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.250
You gotta take some chances,
you know, play not to lose.

09:47.542 --> 09:48.875
Pretty much ensures defeat.

09:49.167 --> 09:50.625
Set 'em up, asshole.

09:59.958 --> 10:01.292
- All right, good play.
- All right.

10:02.292 --> 10:04.417
- Goodnight, Jimmy.
- Goodnight.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.042
I'm here to see Laura Gerard.
I'm her husband.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.917
Mr. Gerard, if you would follow me.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.917
I've been caring for your wife
ever since she came in.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.125
We've be keeping her pretty
sedated on pain medication.

10:46.208 --> 10:49.000
She has several deep lacerations,
internal bleeding.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.250
We're keeping a close watch on her.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.750
Lieutenant Richards, NOPD.

10:56.708 --> 10:57.792
She gave us description.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.792
We're working up a composite likeness.
We're gonna get there.

11:03.750 --> 11:07.583
Could you all give me a moment
with my wife? Please?

11:33.875 --> 11:34.625
I'm sorry.

11:35.750 --> 11:36.792
I'm sorry.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.042
I wanted to her to come out with us.

11:41.750 --> 11:42.750
Hey, Will.

11:48.792 --> 11:49.708
I'm so sorry.

11:51.958 --> 11:54.083
The son of the bitch
who did this to Laura

11:54.792 --> 11:56.125
they're gonna find him.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.750
Go home, Jimmy. It's late.

12:01.417 --> 12:04.083
- I'll be all right.
- Anything you need, man, okay?

12:04.625 --> 12:06.875
- Anything. You just call me.
- Thanks.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.458
Close your own eyes. Tight.

12:23.750 --> 12:24.667
Thank you.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.625
I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.208
Sounds terrible.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.292
Laura, right?
Is she okay?

13:16.792 --> 13:19.125
- Are you with the police?
- No.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.500
No, but I, um...

13:22.792 --> 13:25.875
a couple of years ago,
I experienced something similar.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.167
So it's probably
what you're going through right now.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.792
- You did?
- Yeah.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.625
The man who raped your wife,
he was, uh...

13:35.125 --> 13:37.625
he was paroled three weeks ago.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.333
You know who did this?

13:40.125 --> 13:42.625
He's done it before, he'll do it again.

13:43.292 --> 13:44.625
If you want...

13:46.625 --> 13:48.500
we can take care of him for you.

13:49.292 --> 13:52.500
Take care of who?
What do you mean arrest him?

13:52.958 --> 13:55.875
Uh, well, if we hand him
over to the police

13:56.333 --> 13:59.583
it'll take at least six months
for DNA tests to be completed.

13:59.958 --> 14:02.042
Ultimately there would be a trial
which your wife

14:02.583 --> 14:04.125
assuming she didn't drop
the charges would be...

14:04.417 --> 14:06.583
dragged through
this nightmare over and over.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.417
She'll be in court.
She'll be questioned by the lawyers.

14:10.458 --> 14:14.208
And even if the DA gets a conviction
which is not guaranteed

14:14.833 --> 14:17.625
the rapist can serve
as little as 11 months

14:18.125 --> 14:20.458
you know which is half the time
you get for tax evasion.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.250
Who are you?

14:25.917 --> 14:27.167
I'm Simon.

14:27.542 --> 14:30.292
I represent an organization that, uh...

14:30.792 --> 14:32.417
that deals with people.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.125
Like the man that raped your wife

14:35.583 --> 14:38.292
we would very much like
to take care of him for you.

14:40.208 --> 14:43.500
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.583
You know what I'm talking about.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.417
This wouldn't cost you
anything financially.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.000
I mean if you did want us
to deal with this, uh

14:53.458 --> 14:56.292
we may ask a favor of you
at some point in the future.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.542
Look after somebody
for a couple of hours

14:58.708 --> 15:01.000
or break a security camera,
make a phone call or just

15:01.292 --> 15:03.292
something that would help us out.

15:09.625 --> 15:10.792
You...

15:11.958 --> 15:13.458
you know where he is?

15:13.792 --> 15:17.083
We do but we have a time issue
so, uh, we would have to...

15:17.417 --> 15:19.375
get an answer from you pretty quickly.

15:24.292 --> 15:25.458
Listen.

15:25.625 --> 15:30.417
We're just a few citizens
who are seeking justice.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.042
You know we love the city.
We're tired of watching it go to hell.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.542
No.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.583
No.

15:49.625 --> 15:53.792
Okay. That's okay.
You take care.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.125
Wait.

16:20.583 --> 16:24.625
There's a row of vending machines
in the Oncology Department cafeteria.

16:25.542 --> 16:28.625
If you want this to happen,
select the Forever Bar.

16:29.917 --> 16:34.000
Buy two of them, okay?
Two of them.

16:35.167 --> 16:37.750
And, Mr. Gerard, we never spoke.

16:38.625 --> 16:39.750
You never met me. Okay?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.917
You do not repeat
this conversation to anybody.

18:58.167 --> 19:00.750
- So, you got the healthy ones, huh?
- Excuse me?

19:01.292 --> 19:02.625
I just figured
if you're going to have a treat

19:02.875 --> 19:04.792
you should have
something that's worth it, huh?

20:52.250 --> 20:53.917
Hey. Cool, man.

20:54.458 --> 20:55.375
It's all right.

20:55.917 --> 20:56.792
What the fuck...?

20:57.875 --> 20:59.208
What do you want?

20:59.875 --> 21:01.458
You raped a woman tonight.

21:03.458 --> 21:04.708
Your wife?

21:06.292 --> 21:08.625
I have no wife.
I don't know who she is.

21:09.542 --> 21:12.958
My wife was murdered three months ago
by some scumbag just like you.

21:14.208 --> 21:16.458
Yeah. Yeah.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.500
Kirksey Funeral Homes.

21:48.167 --> 21:49.833
The hungry rabbit jumps.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.000
Mr. Gerard?

21:52.208 --> 21:54.292
- Mr. Gerard?
- Yes.

21:54.625 --> 21:57.167
We need you to sign a few more
insurance forms, please.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.458
I talked to the police this morning.

22:26.417 --> 22:29.375
They found the rapist.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.292
He's dead.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.458
Committed suicide.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.875
We'll find a way to get over this

23:37.583 --> 23:39.000
together.

23:39.958 --> 23:41.208
I know.

23:42.708 --> 23:44.958
- I'm sorry.
- No.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.167
Don't say that.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.875
It's just hard.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.500
Sweetheart, that man is gone.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.333
- I want a new lock on the door.
- Okay.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.083
And bars on the windows.

24:34.375 --> 24:35.458
Will?

24:35.833 --> 24:37.125
Yeah, just me.

24:37.583 --> 24:39.625
- Did you lock the door?
- Doors locked.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.542
I sound like a crazy person.

24:46.875 --> 24:50.125
No, you sound like a person
who's getting over something difficult.

24:56.042 --> 24:57.083
I wanna buy a gun.

24:59.958 --> 25:03.792
We're not keeping a gun in this house.
No guns.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.292
All right. If your stance is not stable
you're not gonna be stable.

25:12.958 --> 25:15.917
Remember feet shoulder-width apart
knees slightly bent.

25:16.792 --> 25:18.125
Lean forward at the waist.

25:18.583 --> 25:19.833
Bring the gun to your eyesight.

25:20.792 --> 25:22.750
You got that front sight, rear sight.

25:23.042 --> 25:24.583
Squeeze the trigger.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.958
There's your pepper spray.

25:29.208 --> 25:31.375
Remember, squeeze the trigger.

25:31.958 --> 25:33.375
- Take care.
- Thanks.

25:33.958 --> 25:35.917
Oh, on you I missed.

25:36.875 --> 25:39.583
- Well, you still have to make it.
- All right,

25:39.958 --> 25:41.958
- side pocket.
- Oh, no. A lot of green, Laura.

25:42.167 --> 25:43.417
A lot of green.

25:46.375 --> 25:49.042
- Oh, good game, honey.
- You're a pool shark.

25:50.417 --> 25:51.000
You noticed.

25:51.333 --> 25:53.500
All right, let's go again.
I'll give you a chance to even the score.

25:53.833 --> 25:57.125
- All right, I'll rack 'em, you grab drinks.
- Fine. Good idea.

26:07.458 --> 26:08.000
Hello?

26:08.458 --> 26:11.083
Will? Come outside.
I need to talk to you.

26:11.458 --> 26:13.958
- Who is this?
- It's Simon. I have to talk to you.

26:14.458 --> 26:15.583
Come outside.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.833
Just tell Laura, it's your sister.

26:21.375 --> 26:24.167
- Hello?
- You see the store on the corner?

26:25.417 --> 26:27.500
- Yes.
- Go in there.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.208
Now I want you to buy a pack of gum

26:35.958 --> 26:37.833
then come out the back entrance.

26:39.417 --> 26:40.917
- Have any gum?
- Yes.

26:41.375 --> 26:42.917
- How much is it?
- Dollar fifty.

26:44.833 --> 26:47.083
- Is that the back entrance?
- Yeah, through that.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.917
- Hey, Will, come on in.
- What do you want?

27:04.542 --> 27:07.083
Just a quick talk.
Relax. You're looking good.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.083
So is your wife. I'm glad to
see you guys are back on track.

27:10.417 --> 27:11.917
What do you want to talk about?

27:12.958 --> 27:14.083
What do you think?

27:21.208 --> 27:24.917
There is a, uh, mailbox
at the entrance of the zoo.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.667
And we would like you
to go there tomorrow after work

27:27.875 --> 27:30.792
and mail this at exactly 4:15.

27:33.875 --> 27:35.292
What is it?

27:35.625 --> 27:37.167
It's a letter to Santa Claus.

27:38.292 --> 27:39.333
Santa Claus?

27:41.917 --> 27:43.708
- And then I'm even?
- Well, that's not up to me.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.583
Well, who's it up to?

27:45.917 --> 27:49.625
All I know is I need you to mail that

28:01.625 --> 28:02.042
Where did you go?

28:02.250 --> 28:05.667
Well, my sister called. It was too noisy
in here so I had to step outside.

28:07.792 --> 28:09.792
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

28:10.792 --> 28:11.708
- Fine.
- Play again? Double or nothing?

28:12.042 --> 28:13.750
No. I'm real tired. Let's go.

28:14.667 --> 28:15.958
- Okay?
- Okay.

29:20.292 --> 29:20.833
Yes?

29:21.583 --> 29:23.167
- You're in the mailbox?
- I am.

29:23.667 --> 29:24.958
Open the letter.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.792
Okay. Hold on.

29:39.708 --> 29:40.833
- Okay.
- Go to the zoo.

29:41.292 --> 29:43.417
Pay for the ticket with cash
and wait by the entrance.

29:44.125 --> 29:45.625
If the woman and the girls show up,

29:46.125 --> 29:51.000
you follow them. If that man appears,
and say, "The hungry rabbit jumps."

29:51.542 --> 29:54.083
- You got it?
- The hungry rabbit jumps.

29:54.750 --> 29:55.917
That's right.

29:56.417 --> 29:59.083
- What does it mean?
- It means what it means.

29:59.417 --> 30:02.167
Now, memorize the number
and their pictures

30:02.458 --> 30:04.542
and tear up that sheet
until it's confetti.

30:05.917 --> 30:07.000
You got it?

30:07.875 --> 30:09.083
Okay, good luck.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.958
I wanna welcome you to the zoo
and to our elephant show.

30:38.167 --> 30:41.958
We have two elephants here
in the Audobon Zoo both Asian females.

30:42.417 --> 30:43.500
This is Jean.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.583
She is 36 years old

30:46.042 --> 30:48.250
and she weighs 7600 pounds.

30:49.625 --> 30:53.500
Anya is 45
and she's 10,400 pounds.

30:54.667 --> 30:55.625
What we're gonna show you today
are a few behaviors

30:55.958 --> 30:57.458
that the elephants know

30:57.875 --> 31:00.083
and things that we need
to do daily to take a look at 'em

31:00.500 --> 31:02.542
to make sure they're healthy
and doing well.

31:22.625 --> 31:23.708
What you're looking at?
I've seen bitch.

31:23.958 --> 31:26.208
All right! All right.
Nobody's looking at anybody.

31:26.458 --> 31:28.458
- Settle down. Come on.
- Don't touch me.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.583
I'm not touching you, I'm guiding you.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.500
All right. We need everybody to...

31:41.083 --> 31:43.666
- Hey, Will.
- You came into my classroom?

31:44.500 --> 31:48.500
- Why? I don't get this.
- No need to shout, Will. I'm right here.

31:51.791 --> 31:53.250
I've done everything you asked

31:53.625 --> 31:56.500
- the Santa Claus letter, the zoo...
- The man didn't show up?

31:56.791 --> 31:59.250
No, I don't think so but,
look, I'm finished.

31:59.458 --> 32:01.750
Will, you've been very helpful
and we appreciate it.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.416
But what you've done
is only part of it, okay?

32:03.625 --> 32:06.416
- We just need you to do one more thing.
- I think you made a mistake here.

32:06.791 --> 32:09.375
I'm not cut out to the kind of activity.

32:09.708 --> 32:11.250
- Yeah?
- I hope you're right.

32:11.458 --> 32:14.583
Will, a promise is a promise, okay?
I'll be in touch.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.416
- Oh.
- Excuse me. Hey, now, my bad, brother.

32:25.625 --> 32:27.166
- It's all right.
- Oh.

32:27.958 --> 32:29.791
- You dropped something.
- No, it's not mine.

32:30.125 --> 32:31.458
Oh, sure it is.

32:32.541 --> 32:34.916
Hey, this isn't mine.

33:12.375 --> 33:13.416
- Will?
- Yeah?

33:13.958 --> 33:16.708
We finished rehearsal early today.
You wanna go out for dinner?

33:18.375 --> 33:19.416
Uh, sure.

33:23.666 --> 33:26.250
- Hello.
- I assume you got the package.

33:27.458 --> 33:28.458
Yes.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.958
Okay, tomorrow morning
you'll have an issue with your car

33:32.541 --> 33:35.416
and take the Number 7
Broad Street bus to school

33:35.708 --> 33:38.250
get off at the Earhart Boulevard stop.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.333
You'll see a pedestrian ramp that
goes down to the ground level.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.458
Walczak takes the bus to work.
He arrives about 8:15.

33:44.791 --> 33:46.166
Wait for him on the ramp.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.500
As he passes

33:48.375 --> 33:50.458
you're gonna bump him and knock him
over the edge. It'll be easy.

33:50.833 --> 33:53.291
There's a low rail.
It's gonna look like a suicide.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.916
Now, there's two security cameras
that cover that spot.

33:56.125 --> 33:58.375
But don't worry about them,
they're both disabled.

33:58.958 --> 34:01.750
- When it's done, you call me.
- No, I am done.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.750
- Will...
- I followed that woman, those girls.

34:05.416 --> 34:06.291
I'm done.

34:06.458 --> 34:09.083
All you have to say is
"the hungry rabbit jumps."

34:09.458 --> 34:12.000
You got it?
The hungry rabbit jumps.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.416
- What are you doing out here?
- I can't get reception inside.

34:46.416 --> 34:47.416
What is it?

34:49.458 --> 34:51.416
Does it have something to do with me?

34:52.458 --> 34:54.291
I read that sometimes

34:55.250 --> 34:57.875
the partner of the victim
has trouble readjusting.

34:58.166 --> 35:01.000
Oh, God, no, no.
We're fine.

35:04.958 --> 35:06.291
Then what is it?

35:06.583 --> 35:10.541
- Will, whatever it is, you can tell me.
- It's nothing. I love you.

35:30.958 --> 35:33.916
So take the Number 7
Broad Street bus to school

35:34.291 --> 35:35.625
get off at the Earhart Boulevard.

35:36.041 --> 35:38.416
Walczak takes the bus to work.
He arrives about 8:15.

35:38.708 --> 35:40.875
You'll see a pedestrian ramp
that goes down to the ground level.

35:41.291 --> 35:44.291
It'll be easy. There's a low rail.
It's gonna look like a suicide.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.458
- Hey, you're late.
- I'm sorry.

36:34.166 --> 36:35.250
But you're never late.

36:35.625 --> 36:37.166
Okay, I get it.

36:37.375 --> 36:39.416
How many times
do you want me to apologize?

36:43.416 --> 36:45.125
And I wished that I had died

36:45.791 --> 36:48.791
and far into the night
he crooned that tune.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.916
The stars went out
and so did the moon.

36:52.708 --> 36:55.708
The singer stopped playing
and went to bed

36:56.958 --> 37:00.125
while the weary blues echoed
through his head.

37:01.291 --> 37:03.083
He slept like a rock

37:04.958 --> 37:06.416
or man that's dead.

37:21.458 --> 37:23.083
What happened?
You backed out?

37:24.208 --> 37:25.083
I told you I couldn't do it.

37:25.416 --> 37:26.958
Will, you know
what a child pornographer does.

37:27.250 --> 37:29.958
He arranges for adult men to
have sex with children in videotapes it.

37:30.166 --> 37:31.625
I get it. He's the scum of the earth.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.000
Needs to get what's coming to him.

37:33.250 --> 37:35.958
But I'm not the guy to do it.
I am not a killer.

37:36.125 --> 37:39.416
- Will, let's not forget what we did for you.
- I wasn't myself that night.

37:39.875 --> 37:42.916
Nobody said anything in the agreement
about killing anybody.

37:43.375 --> 37:45.166
So get the hell out of my life.

38:07.833 --> 38:09.791
Why would someone slash our tires?

38:12.291 --> 38:14.041
But how did they even get
into the garage area?

38:14.291 --> 38:16.041
It wouldn't be all that difficult.

38:19.916 --> 38:20.791
What's the matter?

38:21.333 --> 38:22.291
Nothing.

38:23.166 --> 38:25.083
But why are you acting so weird?

38:26.208 --> 38:28.041
- Why does somehow...
- Will?

38:28.208 --> 38:30.625
Will Gerard?
I thought it was you.

38:31.333 --> 38:33.291
Simon Adams.
We taught over Bartram together.

38:33.583 --> 38:35.916
- Remember?
- Right.

38:36.625 --> 38:39.583
- Hey, Simon.
- Laura, Will's wife.

38:40.208 --> 38:42.041
So how's it going?
Still fighting a good fight?

38:42.416 --> 38:44.416
- Yeah.
- Good.

38:44.875 --> 38:48.583
I got out. I moved to Seattle.
I'm just back consoling a friend. His, uh...

38:49.083 --> 38:50.750
his wife got murdered.

38:52.125 --> 38:56.083
- Oh, my god, that's awful.
- Yeah. Unbelievable. Really, uh,

38:56.791 --> 38:58.208
it really shouldn't have happened.

39:00.166 --> 39:02.416
Well, would you like to join us,
Simon, have a drink?

39:02.916 --> 39:04.958
Sure, just for a moment.
I, uh,

39:05.708 --> 39:07.041
I don't wanna intrude.

39:08.958 --> 39:11.791
- Don't tell me you're a teacher too, Laura?
- I'm a musician.

39:12.125 --> 39:14.541
- Nice. Love to hear you play.
- Simon.

39:15.250 --> 39:19.958
Not to be rude but Laura and I were
actually having a private meal together.

39:20.833 --> 39:23.500
Of course.
Yeah, I understand.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.166
Nice to meet Laura.

39:27.625 --> 39:30.041
It's funny how people come in
and out of each others' lives.

39:31.250 --> 39:32.291
Don't you think?

39:33.250 --> 39:34.125
Call me, Will.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.041
Take care, guys.

39:51.166 --> 39:53.708
It's terrible about his friend's
about his friend's wife being murdered.

40:55.541 --> 40:56.875
What the hell are you doing?

40:57.916 --> 40:59.208
Did you see my work bag?

40:59.958 --> 41:00.875
It's right there.

41:12.375 --> 41:15.333
Honey, I think I left something in the car.
I'll be back right back.

41:15.833 --> 41:16.875
Okay.

41:45.125 --> 41:46.500
Kirksey Funeral Home.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.250
Hello? Kirksey Funeral Home.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.416
- I want to talk to Simon.
- Is this Mr. Gerard?

41:58.375 --> 41:59.916
- Yes.
- Mr. Gerard,

42:00.291 --> 42:02.250
I know that it's
a very tough time for you...

42:02.458 --> 42:03.916
- but we here at Kirksey Funeral Home...
- No, no, no.

42:04.125 --> 42:07.791
Want to make...
- Tell Simon to leave my wife the fuck alone.

42:09.708 --> 42:10.958
Hey, man, do you realize somebody
slashed your tires

42:11.458 --> 42:13.791
- on the other side?
- Yeah, I know that. Thank you.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.416
Jesus, all right, man. Sorry.

42:24.916 --> 42:26.583
- Will?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

42:26.958 --> 42:28.041
Yes.

42:36.625 --> 42:38.916
- Where have you been?
- I told you I had to go down to the car.

42:39.458 --> 42:41.333
Oh, I thought I heard you
walking around.

43:02.916 --> 43:03.875
What?

43:04.791 --> 43:07.750
Nothing. Just watching you.

43:23.750 --> 43:24.750
Laura, uh

43:27.791 --> 43:28.666
I love you.

43:29.833 --> 43:31.500
- I love you too, honey.
- Okay.

43:31.916 --> 43:33.291
I called the "triple A".
They'll...

43:33.958 --> 43:35.791
be here this morning with the tires on.

45:27.916 --> 45:29.875
Mr. Walczak,
I need to speak with you.

45:32.750 --> 45:34.958
Stop! Stop! Stop!

45:35.541 --> 45:36.166
Stop!

45:36.625 --> 45:37.416
Stop!

45:38.083 --> 45:39.083
Please, I need a...

45:40.291 --> 45:41.208
No!

45:44.791 --> 45:45.916
No!

46:20.958 --> 46:22.666
Hi. I'm gonna need your card

46:22.958 --> 46:25.166
and I'm gonna need the locking key
of your wheel nuts.

46:25.541 --> 46:26.458
Do you have it?

46:28.791 --> 46:29.833
Good question.

46:54.666 --> 46:56.291
- Yes?
- Hello, Will.

46:56.875 --> 46:58.208
Just wanted to thank you.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.541
You did a helluva job.
Walczak is dead.

47:00.958 --> 47:03.458
And now you're done.
Have a great life.

47:07.125 --> 47:09.750
- What's up, punk? Say something.
- Hey.

47:10.958 --> 47:11.500
Hey!

47:12.333 --> 47:12.916
Hey!

47:13.333 --> 47:14.291
Come on, break it up! Come on.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.291
- Break it up!
- Hands off me, faggot!

47:18.375 --> 47:20.291
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get off me, man.

47:20.625 --> 47:21.625
Will, what's...?

47:22.625 --> 47:26.208
Striking a student is a minimum
three weeks suspension.

47:26.625 --> 47:27.583
Three weeks.

47:28.250 --> 47:29.541
What the hell are you thinking, Will?

47:33.875 --> 47:35.208
You're home early.

47:37.208 --> 47:39.125
Yeah, it was, uh

47:39.666 --> 47:40.750
half day.

47:41.375 --> 47:43.000
- Student conferences.
- That's funny

47:43.500 --> 47:45.708
because Jimmy called me
to check on you.

47:46.958 --> 47:47.916
What'd he say?

47:48.166 --> 47:50.416
He said that you hit a student
and got suspended.

47:50.750 --> 47:52.458
Yeah, well that kid is, uh...

47:52.750 --> 47:56.875
- he's just, uh, total mess.
- And that makes it right?

47:57.458 --> 47:59.541
Thank you. Thank you, darling,
for your support.

47:59.791 --> 48:01.541
- My support?
- Yes, your support.

48:02.416 --> 48:03.500
Here.

48:07.125 --> 48:08.583
Where did you get this?

48:10.500 --> 48:11.708
Where did you get it?

48:13.833 --> 48:16.583
- I can't tell you that.
- You can't tell me.

48:17.125 --> 48:18.208
I just...

48:19.333 --> 48:21.458
I can't. I can't tell you all right?

48:21.958 --> 48:23.833
- It's not...
- I'm going to rehearsal.

48:37.791 --> 48:39.916
Mahalia Jackson Theater, please.

48:41.625 --> 48:42.625
Laura?

48:47.625 --> 48:50.958
Mr. Gerard, I'm Detective Rudeski.
This is Detective Green.

48:51.458 --> 48:54.416
Sir, we have a warrant for your arrest
for the murder of Alan Marsh.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.375
Who?

48:55.625 --> 48:57.000
Turn around, please, sir.

48:59.291 --> 49:00.333
Who's Alan Marsh?

49:10.541 --> 49:11.416
To the left.

49:17.583 --> 49:19.041
Hand over your cellphone, please.

49:19.625 --> 49:21.750
You're gonna hold this here.
Stand up straight.

49:22.583 --> 49:23.916
- Go ahead.
- No, it's preposterous.

49:24.250 --> 49:26.958
I'm a school teacher.
I teach English at Rampart High.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.541
I am not a murderer.

49:31.458 --> 49:33.791
- How do you know Alan Marsh?
- I don't.

49:35.708 --> 49:37.458
I want you to talks
a look at something.

49:41.458 --> 49:43.333
That's you, right, Mr. Gerard?

49:46.958 --> 49:48.083
Yes.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.500
And here comes Alan Marsh.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.958
Now, how do you know Mr. Marsh?

49:58.791 --> 50:01.333
- I don't.
- That's you again.

50:03.416 --> 50:06.458
Man, you're clearly distressed.
Right?

50:07.291 --> 50:08.583
What happened down there?

50:09.458 --> 50:12.916
There is another camera
that shows the ramp under the freeway.

50:13.125 --> 50:15.416
Good, good because that
all proves I didn't kill him.

50:15.541 --> 50:19.583
Unfortunately someone forgot
to put the tape in the machine.

50:20.375 --> 50:21.791
Empty, no tape.

50:22.125 --> 50:23.791
What were you doing on that ramp?

50:25.541 --> 50:27.458
Yeah, I took the bus to work.

50:27.625 --> 50:29.250
Someone slashed my tires.

50:30.125 --> 50:31.750
You can go and check if you like.

50:32.541 --> 50:34.250
Let me show you something else.

50:34.583 --> 50:36.333
Alan Marsh's cellphone.

50:45.625 --> 50:47.458
Now what were you doing there
at the zoo?

50:55.291 --> 50:57.250
I never saw that man

50:58.291 --> 50:59.833
until the day he died.

51:00.958 --> 51:01.458
I swear it.

51:01.875 --> 51:04.375
Is he gonna write
something bad about you?

51:05.375 --> 51:08.708
- What do you mean?
- Investigative journalists like to pry.

51:11.750 --> 51:13.208
He is a journalist?

51:14.250 --> 51:15.333
Look

51:17.375 --> 51:19.583
why don't you walk us through
what happened?

51:22.000 --> 51:25.416
Will, here's the thing.

51:25.791 --> 51:28.916
You tell us the truth.
We can help each other.

51:31.458 --> 51:32.500
I want a lawyer.

51:46.125 --> 51:47.750
Will Gerard, no priors

51:48.375 --> 51:49.958
teaches high school English.

51:50.291 --> 51:51.666
Married, no kids.

51:52.625 --> 51:55.083
Well, only, I guess,
semi-interesting thing...

51:55.458 --> 51:58.291
is his wife, Laura Gerard,
was raped in September.

51:58.583 --> 52:01.500
- Why would he wanna kill Marsh?
- Uh, we're getting there, right?

52:02.000 --> 52:03.583
You got anything connected
with him and victim?

52:04.000 --> 52:06.333
- Yeah.
- Video of Gerard on the Marsh's phone.

52:06.625 --> 52:08.458
It looks like Marsh
has been following him.

52:10.166 --> 52:11.500
Let me have a go at him.

52:12.041 --> 52:13.000
You give us an hour?

52:13.291 --> 52:16.208
- He'll break soon, boss.
- I said I wanna go at him.

52:16.791 --> 52:19.208
You got 23 unsolved up
there on the board.

52:19.333 --> 52:20.250
Work those.

52:20.916 --> 52:24.291
- Twenty two actually.
- Well, look again, it's 23.

52:29.416 --> 52:33.291
Good afternoon, Mr. Gerard.
I'm Lieutenant Durgan.

52:35.625 --> 52:39.958
Let me ask you a few simple questions,
just procedure. Nothing to worry about.

52:41.791 --> 52:43.083
I wanna lawyer.

52:47.708 --> 52:49.750
The day after Monday is...?

52:51.291 --> 52:52.833
I want a lawyer.

52:53.625 --> 52:56.416
You haven't been charged
with anything, Mr. Gerard.

52:57.333 --> 52:59.125
The day after Monday is...?

52:59.708 --> 53:00.625
Tuesday.

53:01.708 --> 53:03.125
My favorite color is...?

53:03.541 --> 53:04.916
What the hell is this?

53:05.333 --> 53:07.166
My favorite color is...?

53:07.791 --> 53:10.291
My favorite color?
Uh, purple.

53:11.208 --> 53:12.208
Purple.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.083
If a baby is unhappy, he...?

53:17.375 --> 53:18.416
He cries.

53:19.083 --> 53:20.541
The hungry rabbit?

53:27.458 --> 53:28.583
Jumps.

53:29.666 --> 53:31.125
The hungry rabbit jumps.

53:33.333 --> 53:34.166
Got it.

53:42.916 --> 53:43.875
Get up.

53:45.291 --> 53:47.166
Put that on.
I'm gonna leave the room.

53:47.416 --> 53:49.708
Wait 10 seconds
and get the fuck outta here.

53:50.333 --> 53:51.291
And then what?

53:51.583 --> 53:54.000
If you don't go now,
you won't make it through the night.

53:54.375 --> 53:56.791
They'll kill you
and make it look like a suicide.

53:57.375 --> 53:58.791
Shut the door behind you.

54:32.750 --> 54:34.083
Hold on a sec?

55:10.458 --> 55:11.458
Afternoon.

55:25.208 --> 55:27.333
Lieutenant,
you move Will Gerard to Holding?

55:28.458 --> 55:31.791
- No, he's still in three.
- I was just there. It's empty.

55:33.125 --> 55:34.958
- The fuck you're talking about?
- He's not in there.

55:36.083 --> 55:37.416
What do you think he's hiding?

55:40.375 --> 55:43.750
I don't know.
I've never seen him like that before.

55:45.291 --> 55:46.500
An affair?

55:47.125 --> 55:48.083
No.

55:49.750 --> 55:52.541
No, it's something worse than that.

55:52.791 --> 55:55.458
Call him. Tell him, you want some answers,
or you're not coming home.

55:59.625 --> 56:00.958
I'll give you some privacy.

56:11.041 --> 56:11.958
Homicide.

56:14.708 --> 56:17.375
- Who is this?
- Ma'am, this is Detective Rudeski.

56:17.875 --> 56:19.625
Is this Will Gerard's wife?

56:35.791 --> 56:38.041
Hey, it's Trudy.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

56:38.208 --> 56:39.625
Trudy, it's Will.

56:40.041 --> 56:41.458
I need you to do me a favor.

56:41.791 --> 56:44.583
I need you to tell Laura in person,
not on the phone.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.750
Tell her I will try to meet her
at rehearsal tomorrow.

56:48.208 --> 56:49.000
- Leave the corner now.
- Tell her, I'm...

56:49.250 --> 56:51.125
- Leave the corner.
...I'm okay.

56:51.625 --> 56:53.166
All right, come on, buddy.
You're going in.

56:53.541 --> 56:54.916
Just sleep it off tonight.
Let's go.

56:55.291 --> 56:57.583
Come on.
Get your body bag.

57:35.125 --> 57:37.541
Hey, this is Alan Marsh.
This is my website.

57:37.875 --> 57:39.916
Click around on things you
wanna look at have some fun.

57:40.458 --> 57:43.666
You'll find my very byline
my very second byline.

57:57.958 --> 58:00.333
Hey, man.

58:00.833 --> 58:03.916
You skipped school.
They can kiss my ass.

58:04.875 --> 58:07.750
Damn. You decide.
You decide right there. Yeah.

58:12.666 --> 58:15.791
Now you know vandalizing
the school property is illegal, Edwin.

58:16.125 --> 58:19.000
What you're doing here, Mr. G?
I heard you got busted by the cops.

58:19.458 --> 58:21.875
What did you do for,
sucker punching a kid?

58:22.791 --> 58:23.625
No.

58:23.916 --> 58:26.166
Murder, first degree.

58:27.791 --> 58:30.333
I'm sorry I hit it you, Edwin.
I really am.

58:30.666 --> 58:32.875
It's all right.
Maybe I had it coming.

58:33.125 --> 58:35.125
Can you do me a favor, Edwin?

58:35.833 --> 58:36.875
I never saw you, Mr. G.

58:37.583 --> 58:38.625
You never saw us.

58:38.958 --> 58:39.916
Right.

59:48.333 --> 59:49.291
Laura.

59:57.291 --> 59:58.708
Will.

01:00:01.166 --> 01:00:02.416
What the hell is happening?

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.375
What is and you're sure
we can't go to the cops?

01:00:14.916 --> 01:00:17.208
- We tell them everything.
- Some of them are cops.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.750
You can't stay at home.
Go to Lafitte's Hotel,

01:00:20.958 --> 01:00:24.458
wait for me there.
Use this call me. The number's in it.

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:29.583
Here. It's all I've got.

01:00:30.416 --> 01:00:31.208
Take this.

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:36.666
Where it come from?

01:00:38.083 --> 01:00:39.333
I was scared.

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:41.583
I should never have put us in this mess.

01:00:41.833 --> 01:00:44.666
If they had asked me that night,
I would have done the same thing.

01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:47.791
Will, what are you gonna do?

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:49.875
- Where you're gonna go?
- Cops.

01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:53.625
Those were the same guys
that came to our apartment.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.708
You have to go. Go!

01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:00.916
Mrs. Gerard.

01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:02.250
What do you want now?

01:01:03.083 --> 01:01:05.666
A little follow up. Has your husband
tried to contact you, Mrs. Gerard?

01:01:06.125 --> 01:01:08.416
- No, he has not.
- I find that hard to believe.

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:12.125
- Do you?
- You seemed a little tense.

01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:15.083
Yeah, I'm a little tense, Detective.

01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:17.583
In my situation, should I be relaxed?

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:20.750
I have rehearsal.

01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:23.583
- Marshy!
- Marshy!

01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:25.791
- Marshy!
- Marshy!

01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:28.750
Nobody takes a story like you.
You were the best.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:33.500
But Jesus, Marshy, you could have picked
a more dignified way to go out.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:36.166
You escaped from a Chechen jail.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.125
You survived your own divorce,
for crying out loud.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.666
Just barely.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:43.625
And that piece you wrote about
the music industry that was beautiful.

01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:46.250
Gorgeous story.
Marshy, here's to you.

01:01:46.708 --> 01:01:48.583
- You're the real deal.
- Amen, brother.

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:50.041
You redheaded, asshole!

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:53.291
- Here, here!
- Here's a little music for Marshy.

01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:28.875
- We're having a toast to Marshy.
- Marshy!

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.541
And to our new best friend
as long as he keeps buying.

01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:32.916
- Will.
- Will.

01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:39.208
- Marshy was a great guy, huh?
- He was one hell of a journalist.

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:42.833
A couple of weeks ago
we had lunch and, uh

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:45.666
- weirdest thing happened.
- What's that, he paid?

01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:51.958
No, he, uh, he tells me
about the secret organization. Some...

01:02:52.666 --> 01:02:54.916
group that claims to hand out justice

01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:57.541
you know,
when the justice system fails and...

01:02:57.958 --> 01:03:00.083
- He told you that?
- Oh, it's true.

01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:02.458
They killed him,
made it look like a suicide.

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:04.416
You better watch your back there, Will.

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:07.625
Because anybody associated
with Marshy is a marked man.

01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:11.000
- And why do they want him dead?
- Because...

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:13.666
Joe, you tell him.

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:16.125
Because Alan Marsh...

01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:18.958
was an alien.

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:23.291
He was sent here as a scout
to prepare for the invasion of earth.

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:27.458
So, Will you... you are now obligated
to buy us another round.

01:03:27.625 --> 01:03:28.583
Absolutely.

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.208
Augie!

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.291
Don't worry about it, Will.
He's been telling that crazy story to everybody.

01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:46.625
He went so far as even hiding
his own research.

01:03:48.375 --> 01:03:49.625
Where'd he hide it?

01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:52.625
Well, that would be the $64-million
question, wouldn't it?

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:53.666
Cheers.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:57.083
Well, he was obsessed.

01:03:57.583 --> 01:04:00.500
I mean he said he was about to
make that all stuff public.

01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:03.541
The truth is, I mean, Alan...

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:07.541
- he had some issues.
- Yeah, it got worse.

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:09.541
One of the sources got bumped off.

01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:13.166
And after that, I don't know, man.
He just he became like, uh...

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.750
- Different man.
- Yeah.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:18.458
Jumpy, paranoid, lying son of a bitch.

01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:20.583
Just sort of like you, Will.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.416
So what are you, a cop?

01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:26.666
Next time you wanna come snooping
around show your badge

01:04:27.125 --> 01:04:28.958
and don't pretend to be his friend.

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:41.541
Will.

01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:47.958
- Stop him!
- Hey, Will!

01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:50.791
Will, come back. I wanna talk to you.

01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:54.166
Go after him. Get in the car.

01:05:29.083 --> 01:05:30.000
Go, get him.

01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:36.416
He went over himself.

01:05:39.916 --> 01:05:41.333
Get down. Get down below.

01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:44.500
Will?

01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:49.291
No need to run, Will.

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:52.875
I have something that
I think you may want.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.500
It's the tape from the security camera.
I just wanna show you.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:03.500
I have it right here.

01:06:04.416 --> 01:06:06.083
Why don't you come out?
I'll show it to you.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:07.458
Come on, Will.

01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:12.583
Will, come on out.
It's very clear you didn't kill anybody.

01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:15.416
I just want to sell it to you.

01:06:16.291 --> 01:06:17.375
Will?

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:28.166
Hey!

01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:09.166
Goddammit!

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:16.208
Mrs. Gerard...

01:07:16.583 --> 01:07:18.416
I'm Detective Sims of the New Orleans
Police Department.

01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:19.916
Would you come with me, please?

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.833
- Now what?
- Your husband, Mrs. Gerard.

01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:24.666
We just found out some new information
that indicates he's innocent.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:25.791
You do?

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:28.333
We need your help to get him out
of this mess. Come with me, please.

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:29.666
Of course.

01:07:50.458 --> 01:07:52.000
So what's this new evidence?

01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:55.458
- Excuse me?
- You said there was new evidence.

01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:58.291
We'll show you
when we get down the station.

01:08:27.416 --> 01:08:28.875
Man, mother fucker!

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:58.166
The wireless customer
you are calling is not available.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:59.750
Please try again later.

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:11.666
Hey!

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:17.083
In a hyphenated compound situation
do you capitalize the second word?

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:21.458
Only if it's a noun and the words
have equal weight

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:27.083
like, "Homeland Security".
If it's a participle modifying the first word then

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:30.625
you better,
uh... you better keep it lower case.

01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:35.791
Huh, yeah, it makes sense.
Thanks.

01:11:55.166 --> 01:11:58.750
Edmund Burke.
"A philosophical enquiry."

01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:07.958
It is not what a lawyer tells me
I may do but what

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:12.125
humanity, reason,
and justice tell me I ought to do.

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:28.625
There's a guy in the news room
going through Alan Marsh's desk.

01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:30.625
I've never seen him before.

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:31.875
Look.

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.250
Where'd he go?
I'm telling you he was right there.

01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:51.000
Eight sixty five, eight sixty five.
Eight sixty five,

01:13:51.583 --> 01:13:54.041
Here we go 865.
Be right back, sir.

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:18.250
Thank you, sir.
By the way, this is a nice car.

01:14:18.666 --> 01:14:19.583
Thank you.

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:48.583
Paris Truck Stop.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.916
Paris Truck Stop.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.750
Paris Truck Stop.
Paris Truck Stop.

01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:56.166
Twenty one and one Paris Road.

01:14:57.458 --> 01:14:59.416
All right, let's try that.

01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:25.250
I wonder if you could help me.

01:15:25.833 --> 01:15:29.541
I worked for the New Orleans Post.
And I'm looking a missing colleague.

01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:32.583
I know he would come here
to get gas and supplies.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.000
Do you recognize him?

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:42.291
I've seen him.
He goes fishing on the weekends.

01:15:42.708 --> 01:15:44.750
He keeps his boat in one of those
units over there.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:46.375
Which unit?

01:15:47.541 --> 01:15:51.875
22, I think it is.
But I haven't seen him in a few days.

01:15:52.208 --> 01:15:53.875
The truth is, uh

01:15:54.208 --> 01:15:58.750
well, he owes me quite a bit of money.
Is there any way to get in that unit?

01:15:59.833 --> 01:16:02.041
Well, uh, no, I don't have the keys.

01:16:02.416 --> 01:16:05.458
I mean those storage units
have nothing to do with me.

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:10.208
So there's no other possible way
I can in there and get what's owed me?

01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:15.625
Well, it looks like they're made out
of some pretty cheap shit.

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:18.416
I saw some guy accidentally
backed into one.

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:20.541
It went right through the door.

01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:22.125
Really?

01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:27.791
- So he went right through it?
- Right through.

01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:33.208
I really appreciate your understanding
of my situation.

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:36.750
Well, we're all God's children.

01:18:04.416 --> 01:18:05.333
Hey, good morning.

01:21:40.125 --> 01:21:42.416
You know if they find out
I'm talking to you, they're gonna kill me.

01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:44.500
What does the hungry
rabbit jumps mean?

01:21:45.916 --> 01:21:47.875
It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do

01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:51.083
but it's what humanity,
reason and justice tell me I ought to do.

01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:53.000
Edmund Burke said it.

01:21:53.458 --> 01:21:56.541
Hungry-Humanity.
Rabbit-Reason.

01:21:57.041 --> 01:21:59.500
Jumps-Justice.
Humanity, reason, justice.

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:04.083
Well, it was just supposed to be the worst.
You know rapists, murderers

01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:06.583
child molesters. But then...

01:22:07.458 --> 01:22:10.000
Simon he started widening the net.

01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:12.083
Anybody he designated as
"unworthy of living"

01:22:12.458 --> 01:22:13.500
Who's Simon?

01:22:13.916 --> 01:22:16.166
He runs my cell.
I don't know his real name.

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.583
- Tell me about how your cell works.
- Uh, it's just handful of men.

01:22:21.166 --> 01:22:22.625
Uh, Simon gives us our orders.

01:22:22.916 --> 01:22:27.500
He gets his from higher up. I mean
the idea is that if complications arise

01:22:27.958 --> 01:22:31.083
then the cell can be cut off
without a threat to the organization.

01:22:31.583 --> 01:22:33.875
We also use people
who have made a deal with us

01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:35.458
who owes us a favor.

01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:36.916
Hey, look

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:40.041
I got into this because I was sick
of seeing the city rot.

01:22:41.083 --> 01:22:44.541
I wanted to help. I wanted to
make it a livable place for my family

01:22:45.625 --> 01:22:47.333
my two little girls.

01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:50.750
Okay? But now it's... it's wrong.

01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:53.583
Simon's out of control
and I have no way

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:56.166
for talking anybody higher
in the organization.

01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:58.750
Oh, god.

01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:01.000
- What is it, Mr. Bourdette?
- I can't. This is wrong.

01:23:01.583 --> 01:23:02.416
Whoa!

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:03.666
Mr. Bourdette?

01:23:09.625 --> 01:23:12.583
November 3rd, this is Alan Marsh.

01:23:52.458 --> 01:23:55.125
Will, Jesus, man,
everybody's looking...

01:23:57.291 --> 01:23:59.958
- Christ, what the hell is going on?
- I know, Jimmy.

01:24:00.291 --> 01:24:02.333
- What the fuck do you know?
- I saw the pictures.

01:24:02.833 --> 01:24:03.916
You and Simon.

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:06.125
- You're part of this.
- Look, okay. Will,

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:10.333
okay, listen to me, okay?
I'm a part of the organization, okay?

01:24:10.666 --> 01:24:13.000
I joined 15 years ago
when my brother got killed.

01:24:13.333 --> 01:24:16.791
They didn't even test the bastard.
I had to do something so I'm sorry.

01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:21.250
The fucking scumbag that raped Laura
I wanted him crucified.

01:24:21.458 --> 01:24:24.041
Who set me up for the murder
of that reporter, huh?

01:24:24.416 --> 01:24:26.375
- Was it you, you fuck?
- I called Durgan

01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:28.708
told him to let you go.
That was me.

01:24:29.541 --> 01:24:31.291
What's Simon's real name?

01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:35.791
Will, I can't tell you that.

01:24:36.166 --> 01:24:38.625
You have no idea
what this guy is capable of.

01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:42.083
His name.

01:24:43.375 --> 01:24:45.583
- I'm your fucking friend.
- No!

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.750
You're Simon's friend.
You tell me his fucking name.

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:51.416
What's his name?

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:32.166
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:34.250
- Open the seatbelt.
- Get out of the car!

01:25:34.916 --> 01:25:35.791
Okay.

01:25:37.458 --> 01:25:38.791
Fuck you pedophile.

01:25:39.875 --> 01:25:40.916
The hungry rabbit jumps.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.875
- The hungry rabbit jumps.
- The hungry rabbit jumps.

01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:52.041
How long have you been following me?

01:25:52.541 --> 01:25:53.541
Answer me!

01:25:54.166 --> 01:25:56.875
Not long. Just from that house
on Seaborne Street.

01:25:57.416 --> 01:25:58.916
I was just told to wait for you there.

01:25:59.208 --> 01:26:00.958
And if you turned up
and I was to follow you and...

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:02.541
Why did you agree to kill me?

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:04.208
I owed him.

01:26:04.666 --> 01:26:06.625
He killed the man
who murdered my sister.

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:07.750
Simon?

01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:10.583
- What's his mobile number?
- It's in my cellphone.

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:12.000
Get up.

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:15.250
- Get up!
- Don't kill me, please. Please don't kill...

01:26:16.291 --> 01:26:17.416
Get up! Give me the phone.

01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:21.208
Get outta here, Go!

01:26:51.708 --> 01:26:53.958
What does hungry rabbit jumps mean?

01:26:55.083 --> 01:26:57.250
"It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do..."

01:27:00.291 --> 01:27:01.000
Yeah?

01:27:01.458 --> 01:27:02.833
Eugene Cook

01:27:03.375 --> 01:27:05.583
head of the RJ Allen Group.

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:07.416
- Will?
- You framed me.

01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:10.083
You framed me for the murder
of Alan Marsh.

01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:12.000
I also know that

01:27:12.333 --> 01:27:15.208
you had Bourdette killed.
Watch.

01:27:21.625 --> 01:27:23.166
The hungry rabbit jumps mean...

01:27:24.208 --> 01:27:27.333
"It's not what a lawyer tells me
I must do but it's what..."

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:29.125
And there's more.

01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:30.791
Very resourceful.

01:27:31.125 --> 01:27:33.416
I want the security tape
from the overpass.

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.500
The one that shows I didn't kill Marsh.

01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:37.083
So I've got something you want

01:27:37.208 --> 01:27:39.041
and now it looks like
you've got something I want.

01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:40.250
We should trade.

01:27:40.708 --> 01:27:42.083
Here's what's going to happen.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.083
You're going to meet me
at the Super dome

01:27:45.541 --> 01:27:46.833
five o'clock tonight.

01:27:48.333 --> 01:27:49.291
You bring the tape.

01:27:52.958 --> 01:27:56.375
- Eugene Cook.
- There'll be a prepaid ticket in your name.

01:27:56.791 --> 01:27:58.208
Go to your assigned seat

01:27:59.166 --> 01:28:00.708
and wait for me there.

01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:47.375
Hey, Trudy, I need to talk to you.
Can I come in?

01:28:47.875 --> 01:28:49.000
Yeah, sure.

01:28:51.625 --> 01:28:54.416
By hiding out, she is not helping Will.

01:28:54.958 --> 01:28:57.250
And she may be charged with aiding
and abetting a fugitive

01:28:57.666 --> 01:28:58.791
or even as an accessory to murder.

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:00.333
- Do you...
- I'm sorry, Jimmy. I don't know.

01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:02.416
She's not answering her cell.
She's not returning my calls.

01:29:02.791 --> 01:29:04.041
You're her best friend, right?

01:29:04.125 --> 01:29:06.750
You know her better than
maybe anyone else in the whole world.

01:29:07.125 --> 01:29:09.416
If you were in her shoes,
where would you go?

01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:23.291
Will?

01:29:25.625 --> 01:29:28.208
- Who is it?
- Laura? Where's Jimmy?

01:29:30.458 --> 01:29:31.583
- How did you...?
- Can I come in?

01:29:31.958 --> 01:29:32.625
Where's Will?

01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:47.083
Will?

01:29:49.541 --> 01:29:50.750
I'm here.

01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:53.583
- Where are you?
- Get up on your seat

01:29:53.791 --> 01:29:55.291
and head towards the concourse.

01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:59.916
- What?
- Get up and head toward the concourse.

01:30:19.958 --> 01:30:22.750
- Yeah?
- Go out on to the concourse.

01:30:23.125 --> 01:30:25.500
You'll see a men's room.
Go in.

01:30:35.958 --> 01:30:36.500
Yeah?

01:30:37.125 --> 01:30:38.041
Take a leak.

01:30:52.125 --> 01:30:53.958
- Yeah?
- Go to the hot-dog stand

01:30:54.041 --> 01:30:56.083
and buy yourself a hot-dog.

01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:15.625
Having fun?

01:31:32.041 --> 01:31:32.791
Look at you

01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:36.208
- trying not to kill a child pornographer.
- He wasn't a child pornographer.

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:38.000
Oh, but you didn't know that.

01:31:38.666 --> 01:31:40.083
You must be a good man, Will.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.791
An endangered species.

01:31:41.958 --> 01:31:44.708
- But where is the actual security tape?
- Yeah?

01:31:47.125 --> 01:31:49.083
Good.
Sent me a picture.

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:55.500
It's with your wife.

01:31:57.166 --> 01:31:59.583
This time Jimmy's done a good job.
Now where's my DVD?

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:02.166
I don't have it on me.

01:32:02.958 --> 01:32:04.875
I'll tell you where it is
when I get my wife.

01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:13.000
Well, she's in the abandoned mall
next door.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.750
Let's go see her.

01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:33.125
You believe they
haven't fixed this place up

01:32:33.791 --> 01:32:35.666
all these years after the hurricane?

01:32:49.833 --> 01:32:50.791
Laura.

01:32:52.125 --> 01:32:54.375
Sorry, buddy.
You left me no choice.

01:32:54.875 --> 01:32:55.791
Let her go.

01:33:01.125 --> 01:33:02.041
Did you make copies of this thing?

01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:03.791
- No.
- Now that's good.

01:33:04.333 --> 01:33:07.250
'Cause if you did, I'm gonna fly to Philly
and find your sister and her two little kids

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:10.041
- and tell them a really scary bedtime story.
- You have what you want.

01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:11.791
Please let her go.

01:33:13.333 --> 01:33:15.875
What I do is so important
to jeopardize. I'm sorry.

01:33:16.416 --> 01:33:18.625
So you and Laura are not gonna
walk outta here today.

01:33:20.666 --> 01:33:21.833
You're insane.

01:33:25.916 --> 01:33:26.791
What did you say?

01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:30.041
I said I think you're sick.

01:33:31.958 --> 01:33:34.166
On the contrary, I am very well.

01:33:34.833 --> 01:33:36.000
You don't see it, do you?

01:33:36.458 --> 01:33:39.250
The city and how close
we are to absolute chaos?

01:33:40.875 --> 01:33:42.541
Jimmy sees it.
Don't you, Jimmy?

01:33:44.125 --> 01:33:45.583
Sick, I'm not sick.

01:33:45.916 --> 01:33:48.583
The sick ones are sitting on their fat,
fucking asses eating and

01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:51.416
drinking and fucking themselves
into a stupor.

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:55.583
Polluting the world without a second
thought while it goes down the toilet.

01:33:55.833 --> 01:33:58.041
Nobody wants
to do the nasty work, Will.

01:33:58.583 --> 01:33:59.833
You know the shit that
we all just think about.

01:34:00.041 --> 01:34:02.291
Most good citizens
are just along for the ride

01:34:02.625 --> 01:34:05.083
and they fucking bitch and moan
and complain about everything

01:34:05.458 --> 01:34:06.458
when it doesn't work out.

01:34:07.458 --> 01:34:08.750
But not me.

01:34:09.458 --> 01:34:10.333
Get it done.

01:34:12.458 --> 01:34:13.250
Will!

01:34:25.791 --> 01:34:26.958
What the fuck, Jimmy?

01:34:28.791 --> 01:34:30.666
You promised not to hurt them!

01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:34.666
We didn't get into this organization
to kill innocent people.

01:34:40.958 --> 01:34:42.041
Laura, run!

01:34:43.999 --> 01:34:44.999
You're happy now?

01:35:44.624 --> 01:35:45.583
Will!

01:35:46.958 --> 01:35:47.833
Will!

01:36:54.666 --> 01:36:56.583
So Jimmy's dead, huh?

01:36:57.124 --> 01:36:58.541
Eugene Cook killed him.

01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:08.624
Who killed Eugene Cook?

01:37:09.708 --> 01:37:10.791
I did.

01:37:12.624 --> 01:37:13.874
I don't think so.

01:37:16.791 --> 01:37:17.916
Here's what happened.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:22.083
Eugene Cook
and Jimmy killed each other.

01:37:22.874 --> 01:37:24.874
I don't even think you two were here.

01:37:28.666 --> 01:37:31.583
Simple case of a dead man
killing a dead man.

01:37:33.708 --> 01:37:36.958
You don't suppose I could interest you
in joining our organization.

01:37:37.874 --> 01:37:39.791
- No.
- You sure?

01:37:41.124 --> 01:37:43.666
Well, if you have a change of heart

01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:45.624
you know where to find me, right?

01:37:46.791 --> 01:37:49.041
Now, I think you two better
get the hell outta here.

01:37:49.499 --> 01:37:50.458
Lieutenant.

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:53.666
The story you just told us

01:37:54.333 --> 01:37:55.916
is that how it's going to be?

01:37:57.166 --> 01:37:58.541
This is New Orleans.

01:37:59.166 --> 01:38:00.708
Yeah, that's how it's gonna be.

01:38:03.958 --> 01:38:04.958
Go on.

01:38:13.041 --> 01:38:15.416
Breaking news, we're going live
to Catherine James

01:38:15.666 --> 01:38:16.583
on the scene.

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:20.541
Detective, the bodies of four males were
found shot in that abandoned mall.

01:38:20.916 --> 01:38:22.208
Can you tell us what happened?

01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:25.249
I'm not gonna comment in the middle
of an ongoing investigation.

01:38:25.499 --> 01:38:26.416
But I can tell you

01:38:26.499 --> 01:38:29.666
NOPD is gonna do everything
in its power to get to the bottom of it.

01:38:29.999 --> 01:38:34.416
In other news, prosecutors have dropped all
charges against school teacher Will Gerard

01:38:34.958 --> 01:38:38.041
who was accused of murdering
the New Orleans Post reporter Alan Marsh.

01:38:38.624 --> 01:38:40.958
A security tape uncovered by the NOPD

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:44.083
clearly proves that Gerard
did not kill Alan Marsh

01:38:44.458 --> 01:38:49.166
and, in fact, was trying to defend himself
when Marsh attacked him on the walkway

01:38:49.458 --> 01:38:51.291
under the Broad Street overpass.

01:39:21.208 --> 01:39:24.583
This is for you.
It's Marsh's research. It's just a start.

01:39:26.624 --> 01:39:27.458
Thanks, Will.

01:39:27.833 --> 01:39:31.249
He just scratched the surface
and I thought someone should finish it.

01:39:32.124 --> 01:39:33.166
I'll give it a look.

01:39:34.666 --> 01:39:36.416
The hungry rabbit jumps, eh?
