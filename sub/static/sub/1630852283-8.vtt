You show up, you make shoes,

00:06.715 --> 00:07.925

00:07.925 --> 00:09.551
Why would a cobbler shop

00:09.551 --> 00:11.512
need a human resources department?

00:11.512 --> 00:14.014
You'd be surprised.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.642
Now, Artie,

00:16.642 --> 00:19.102
it was your idea to use phoenix leather

00:19.102 --> 00:21.688

00:21.688 --> 00:23.023
Can you tell us why?

00:23.023 --> 00:26.777
‐ Because phoenix leather
is sturdy, long‐lasting, low‐cost,

00:26.777 --> 00:28.654
and a phoenix killed my father.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.949
‐ Right. And the downside
of using phoenix leather?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.784

00:48.549 --> 00:51.134
you've got a customer
whose foot is missing

00:51.134 --> 00:52.845

00:52.845 --> 00:56.056
Now, how are you going
to keep this customer loyal?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.516
‐ Give me a free shoe.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.560
Ah!

01:01.645 --> 01:05.107
