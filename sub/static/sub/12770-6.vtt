STUCK IN MY HEAD,

00:08.333 --> 00:09.709
LIKE ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.125
I MEAN, I SLEPT
FOR SIX HOURS LAST NIGHT,

00:11.166 --> 00:13.500
AND THE SONG UNDERSCORED
THE ENTIRE SIX HOURS.

00:13.542 --> 00:15.000
WHAT'S THE SONG?

00:15.041 --> 00:17.000
(sighs) I'M LOOKING FOR
SPERM DONORS, YOU KNOW?

00:17.041 --> 00:18.291
I MEAN, I FELL ASLEEP

00:18.333 --> 00:21.083
READING MEDICAL HISTORIES,
FILES.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.792
I MEAN, YOU'D THINK
I'D DREAM ABOUT THAT.

00:23.834 --> 00:25.041
I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE SONG.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.792
CAN YOU SING THE PART
THAT'S STUCK IN YOUR HEAD?

00:26.834 --> 00:28.959
I DON'T SING.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.667
I DON'T JUDGE.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.041
ALL RIGHT.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.250
IT WAS JUST A STUPID SONG

MM.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.458
HI.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.125
MORNING.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.291
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THIS,

02:19.333 --> 02:20.959
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE
AS HUNGOVER AS I AM,

02:21.000 --> 02:22.166
IT SUCKS TO WAKE UP
THIS EARLY,

02:22.208 --> 02:23.709
BUT I GOTTA GO TO WORK,

02:23.750 --> 02:25.792
WHICH MEANS
YOU'VE GOTTA GET OUT.

02:25.834 --> 02:28.792
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.

02:28.834 --> 02:30.125
(exhales)

02:30.166 --> 02:32.041
BUT, LIKE...

02:32.083 --> 02:33.792
NOW.

02:33.834 --> 02:34.792
(exhales)

02:34.834 --> 02:36.917
BECAUSE I'M LATE.

02:36.959 --> 02:39.375
RIGHT. OKAY.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.750
(boy) THE FERRARI 458 SPYDER,

02:58.792 --> 03:00.417
IS POWERED BY A 4.5-LITER V8.

03:00.458 --> 03:03.208
IT CAN HIT 62 MILES AN HOUR
IN LESS THAN 3.5 SECONDS

03:03.250 --> 03:06.709
AND REACH A TOP SPEED
OF OVER 198 MILES PER HOUR.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.750
(imitates car engine revving)
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
REALLY GOOD.

03:08.792 --> 03:10.959
I'M MORE OF A PORSCHE GUY
MYSELF, BUT--

03:11.000 --> 03:11.959
(imitates brakes squealing)

03:12.000 --> 03:13.417
DR. FREEDMAN,

03:13.458 --> 03:15.458
PORSCHES ARE NOT AS COOL
AS FERRARIS.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.959
OH.
(woman) OLLIE.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.458
OLLIE, CAN YOU TAKE THAT FERRARI
OUT TO THE WAITING ROOM?

03:18.500 --> 03:20.000
WE NEED TO TALK
TO DR. FREEDMAN.

03:20.041 --> 03:21.959
(imitates engine revving)

03:22.000 --> 03:24.041
DRIVE CAREFULLY.
IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.250
(continues imitating engine)
OKAY?

03:25.291 --> 03:26.792
(chuckles)

03:26.834 --> 03:29.041
UM... (chuckles) WELL,
HE'S CERTAINLY HIGH ENERGY.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.583
BUT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S
NORMAL,

03:30.625 --> 03:32.834
AND THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE
FOR ANY KIND OF THYROID ISSUE.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.834
SO I CAN'T FIND
ANY PHYSICAL TRIGGERS

03:34.875 --> 03:36.041
FOR HYPERACTIVITY.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.625
SO YOU THINK HE'S A.D.H.D.,
JUST LIKE BRIAN?

03:38.667 --> 03:41.041
IT COULD BE.
UM, HOW IS BRIAN?

03:41.083 --> 03:42.500
HE JUST GOT INTO STANFORD.

03:42.542 --> 03:44.041
WHAT?
CONGRATULATIONS.

03:44.083 --> 03:45.500
YOU GOTTA GIVE HIM
A HIGH-FIVE FOR ME.

03:45.542 --> 03:46.625
ALTHOUGH, HE'S 18.

03:46.667 --> 03:47.792
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T WANT
A HIGH-FIVE

03:47.834 --> 03:48.792
FROM HIS PEDIATRICIAN.

03:48.834 --> 03:50.917
DR. FREEDMAN,
IF OLLIE HAS IT, TOO,

03:50.959 --> 03:51.834
WE WOULD LIKE TO TREAT IT

03:51.875 --> 03:53.875
AS EARLY AND AS AGGRESSIVELY
AS POSSIBLE.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.417
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
THE WAY HE WAS

03:55.458 --> 03:57.041
RATTLING THOSE STATS OFF
ABOUT THAT CAR,

03:57.083 --> 03:58.792
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A KID
WHO'S HAVING TROUBLE FOCUSING.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.375
AND IF HE'S
JUST A LITTLE BIT HYPER,

04:00.417 --> 04:02.625
YOU KNOW, I WAS HYPER
WHEN I WAS A KID.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.834
RESPECTFULLY, DR. FREEDMAN,

04:04.875 --> 04:06.041
WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.667
A.D.H.D. RUNS IN THE FAMILY,

04:07.709 --> 04:09.792
AND THE MEDICATION
REALLY HELPED BRIAN.
MM-HMM.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.792
YEAH, I MEAN, BRIAN WAS A LITTLE
BIT OLDER WHEN WE DIAGNOSED HIM.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.667
OLLIE IS HAVING TANTRUMS.
HE'S THROWING FITS.

04:14.709 --> 04:16.041
OKAY. I JUST DON'T WANT
TO JUMP THE GUN.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.041
BUT THERE ARE
SOME OTHER TESTS WE CAN RUN.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.041
UH, MY ASSOCIATE,
WHO IS A THERAPIST,

04:20.083 --> 04:21.917
DR. SHELDON WALLACE,
COULD PROBABLY SEE YOU TODAY.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.291
GREAT. THANK YOU.

04:25.583 --> 04:28.417
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:28.458 --> 04:30.041
HEY. ANY PROGRESS?

04:30.083 --> 04:31.750
MM. OKAY.

04:31.792 --> 04:34.417
I THINK...

04:34.458 --> 04:37.041
I HAVE IT BOILED DOWN
TO...

04:37.083 --> 04:40.041
THE CLASSICAL MUSICIAN
AND THE GEOLOGIST.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.125
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND RENAME THEM

04:42.166 --> 04:44.667
SOFT AND SOFTER.

04:44.709 --> 04:45.875
I'M SORRY?

04:45.917 --> 04:47.041
THE GEOLOGIST--
THAT WAS THE WEIRD KID

04:47.083 --> 04:48.458
WHO WAS ALWAYS OBSESSED
WITH ROCKS

04:48.500 --> 04:50.709
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T FIND
ANY FRIENDS.

04:50.750 --> 04:51.917
DEFINITELY DIDN'T HAVE
ANY GIRLFRIENDS.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.750
AND THE CLASSICAL MUSICIAN--

04:53.792 --> 04:55.083
NO, MUSICIANS ARE HOT.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.041
NO, ROCK STARS ARE HOT.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.500
CLASSICAL MUSICIANS
ARE SOFT.

04:58.542 --> 05:01.083
YOU GOTTA FIND A DONOR
THAT'S GOT A LITTLE MORE...

05:01.125 --> 05:02.792
TESTOSTERONE.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.041
SAM... LOOK, I-I--

05:04.083 --> 05:08.291
I'VE THROWN OUT 48 DONORS
ON MEDICAL HISTORY ALONE.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.792
I MEAN, I'VE ELIMINATED
ALL POTENTIAL FOR HEART DISEASE,

05:10.834 --> 05:12.542
STROKE, UH, DEMENTIA.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.041
I MEAN, ARE YOU REALLY--

05:14.083 --> 05:15.875
ARE YOU REALLY TELLING ME
THAT I NOW NEED TO CONSIDER

05:15.917 --> 05:17.375
POTENTIAL TESTOSTERONE LEVELS?

05:17.417 --> 05:18.917
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU'RE--

05:18.959 --> 05:21.083
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN AMAZING MOTHER, ALL RIGHT?

05:21.125 --> 05:22.959
BUT THIS KID, YOU KNOW,
IS NOT GONNA HAVE A DAD,

05:23.000 --> 05:25.041
SO IT ALREADY IS GONNA HAVE
ENOUGH SOFT, ALL RIGHT?

05:25.083 --> 05:27.500
HAVING A DONOR THAT'S GOT
A LITTLE BIT MORE TESTOSTERONE

05:27.542 --> 05:29.041
MIGHT NOT BE
SUCH A BAD THING.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.125
YOU KNOW WHAT? MY--MY F.S.H.
IS THROUGH THE ROOF,

05:31.166 --> 05:32.709
I'M A WOMAN IN MY 40's.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.291
I MEAN, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THAT EVEN WITH

05:34.333 --> 05:36.125
ALL THESE
CRAZY-MAKING HORMONES I'M ON

05:36.166 --> 05:37.709
THAT I'M STILL
THE EGGLESS WONDER.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.709
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.375
ADDISON. ADDISON.
(sighs)

05:41.417 --> 05:43.041
YOU ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.041
(laughs)

05:44.083 --> 05:46.041
NOW IS THIS SOMETHING
THAT YOU REALLY WANT?

05:46.083 --> 05:47.083
YES, I WANT THIS.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.333
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.166
SO PICK SOME SPERM,

05:50.208 --> 05:54.208
JUST MAKE SURE IT'S GOT
SOME TESTOSTERONE IN IT.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.000
(Sheldon) WHAT GAME
ARE YOU PLAYING?

05:56.041 --> 05:57.041
"DRIVE."

05:57.083 --> 05:59.000
I'M ABOUT TO GET THREE STARS
ON EVERY LEVEL.

05:59.041 --> 06:01.041
WOW.
THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.041
HOW ARE YOUR GRADES
IN SCHOOL?

06:03.083 --> 06:04.208
BAD.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.041
I GOT A "B" IN ENGLISH.
(engine revs)

06:07.083 --> 06:08.458
(chimes)
THREE STARS!

06:08.500 --> 06:09.458
(chuckles)

06:09.500 --> 06:11.000
A "B" IS BAD?

06:11.041 --> 06:14.041
TELL DR. WALLACE
HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOU

06:14.083 --> 06:16.208
TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK ALONE.
(game beeps)

06:16.250 --> 06:18.834
MOM AND DAD ALWAYS
HELP ME ON MY HOMEWORK

06:18.875 --> 06:20.041
BECAUSE IT TAKES ME
TOO LONG ON MY OWN.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.000
AND YOU CAN'T SIT STILL

06:22.041 --> 06:24.000
DURING READING TIME
AT SCHOOL, RIGHT?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.667
WHEN CAN WE GO HOME?

06:27.709 --> 06:29.041
MAY I SPEAK WITH OLLIE
PRIVATELY?

06:29.083 --> 06:31.041
I DON'T SEE
WHY THAT'S NECESSARY.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.041
HE'S 8, AND HE'S
PERFECTLY WELL-ADJUSTED.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.917
HE DOESN'T NEED THERAPY.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.041
WELL, IF HE'S
PERFECTLY WELL-ADJUSTED,

06:36.083 --> 06:37.625
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

06:37.667 --> 06:39.041
HE'S HYPERACTIVE.
(tires screeching,
engine revving)

06:39.083 --> 06:42.375
IT WOULD HELP ME
TO ASSESS HIM

06:42.417 --> 06:44.041
IF I COULD HAVE
A FEW MOMENTS WITH HIM.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.041
HE'S A YOUNG BOY.
YOU'RE A MAN WE'RE JUST MEETING.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.542
WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE HIM
ALONE WITH YOU.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.875
OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT.

06:50.917 --> 06:52.250
WHY DON'T WE MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT

06:52.291 --> 06:54.250
FOR HIM TO TAKE
SOME DIAGNOSTIC TESTS?

06:54.291 --> 06:55.667
(beeps)

06:55.709 --> 06:57.500
AND IF YOU GIVE ME THE NAME
AND NUMBER OF HIS TEACHER,

06:57.542 --> 06:59.291
I'LL SPEAK WITH HER AND...

06:59.333 --> 07:01.417
HAVE HER COMPLETE
SOME DIAGNOSTIC INVENTORIES,

07:01.458 --> 07:03.417
AND... WE'LL GET BACK
TO YOU.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.083
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT

07:05.125 --> 07:07.041
WHEN BRIAN WAS DIAGNOSED.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.667
OUR DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH
HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST DECADE

07:09.709 --> 07:12.041
AS WE'VE COME TO
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DISORDER.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.041
AND MOST PEOPLE THINK
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.458
PRESCRIBING ANY DRUG
FOR A CHILD

07:15.500 --> 07:17.417
IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

07:17.458 --> 07:18.917
OKAY.

07:18.959 --> 07:20.417
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME

07:20.458 --> 07:23.041
AND YOUR SOMEWHAT STARTLING
CONDESCENSION.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.041
MRS. GRAHAM--

07:25.083 --> 07:26.125
WE ARE GOOD PARENTS.

07:26.166 --> 07:27.959
OUR OLDEST SON
IS HEADED TO STANFORD,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.917
AND OLLIE IS ON
THE HONOR ROLL AT SCHOOL,

07:29.959 --> 07:31.125
AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE
WE'RE RUNNING AROUND

07:31.166 --> 07:33.041
GETTING PRESCRIPTIONS FOR DRUGS
THAT OUR KIDS DON'T NEED.

07:33.083 --> 07:34.583
SO THANK YOU...
I--

07:34.625 --> 07:35.583
FOR YOUR TIME.

07:35.625 --> 07:36.875
COME, SWEETIE.

07:36.917 --> 07:38.000
BUT WE'LL BE FINDING
A NEW DOCTOR.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.250
THANK YOU.

07:41.291 --> 07:43.917
(door opens)

07:43.959 --> 07:45.750
(door closes)

07:49.375 --> 07:51.041
DR. TURNER.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.083
HAVE A SEAT.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.250
YOU'RE VERY SMILEY TODAY.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.000
I GET REALLY SMILEY
WHEN I HAVE GOOD NEWS.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.542
FOR THIS REASON,
I'M TERRIBLE AT POKER.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.083
F-FOR ME?
YOU HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR ME?

07:59.125 --> 08:01.959
THE BOARD HAS AGREED
TO REVISIT YOUR CASE.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.542
REVISIT? WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:04.583 --> 08:06.166
IT MEANS WE HAVE WORK TO DO,

08:06.208 --> 08:07.917
BECAUSE WE'VE CONVINCED THEM
THAT SUSPENDING YOU FOR A YEAR

08:07.959 --> 08:09.750
WAS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF YOUR PATIENTS.

08:09.792 --> 08:11.333
IT MEANS WE HAVE A SHOT,
DR. TURNER,

08:11.375 --> 08:13.166
AT GETTING YOU BACK TO WORK
SOMETIME SOON.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.375
HEY, JASON, I WANT YOU
TO CALL ME VIOLET

08:16.417 --> 08:18.333
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A HUG RIGHT NOW,

08:18.375 --> 08:21.041
AND FOR THAT, I THINK WE NEED
TO BE ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.083
(laughs)

08:23.125 --> 08:24.291
THANK YOU.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.583
YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:27.542 --> 08:29.500
(indistinct conversations)

08:29.542 --> 08:31.542
(knock on door,
door opens)

08:33.208 --> 08:36.000
YOU'RE LATE.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.709
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.041
(blows air)

08:40.083 --> 08:41.166
(beeps)

08:44.917 --> 08:47.417
AMELIA.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.041
YEAH.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.041
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR FRIEND MICHELLE.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.041
I'M VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.375
THANKS.

08:56.417 --> 09:00.041
BUT IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE FOR YOU
DROPPING THE BALL AT WORK.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.750
YOU'VE BEEN LATE REPEATEDLY,

09:01.792 --> 09:03.333
YOUR CHARTS ARE A MESS.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.000
IF YOU NEED
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE

09:05.041 --> 09:07.166
WHILE YOU MOURN YOUR FRIEND,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK ME.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.375
CHARLOTTE, ALL I NEED IS
FOR YOU TO GET OFF MY BACK.

09:09.417 --> 09:11.125
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT?

09:11.166 --> 09:12.166
I HAVE A JOB TO DO HERE,
AND--

09:12.208 --> 09:13.458
THIS ISN'T YOUR JOB.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.417
HARASSING ME IS NOT YOUR JOB.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.041
BABYSITTING ME,
CHECKING UP ON ME,

09:17.083 --> 09:19.041
BREATHALYZING ME,
IT'S NOT YOUR JOB.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.583
IT'S YOUR DAMN HOBBY.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.041
YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY,
CHARLOTTE, WHAT I--

09:22.083 --> 09:25.667
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM
WITH ME?

09:27.250 --> 09:30.083
WHAT IS YOUR DAMAGE?

09:38.250 --> 09:41.041
(Charlotte) HEY, BABY,
GUESS WHO I RAN INTO TODAY.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.083
AAH!

09:42.125 --> 09:43.166
OH, MY GOD.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.667
WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.083
I'M HIS DAMN WIFE,
YOU WHORE.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.792
CHARLIE, WAIT.
NOW LET ME EXPLAIN.
AAH!

09:47.834 --> 09:50.041
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

09:50.083 --> 09:52.333
I'LL KILL YOU!
(woman) GET OFF OF HIM!

09:52.375 --> 09:54.250
I'LL KILL YOU!

10:02.750 --> 10:04.208
A DECADE BEFORE OLLIE WAS BORN,

10:04.250 --> 10:05.208
THAT'S HOW LONG I'VE BEEN
TREATING THIS FAMILY,

10:05.250 --> 10:06.458
AND FIVE MINUTES WITH YOU,

10:06.500 --> 10:07.500
AND THEY'RE RUNNING
FOR THE DOOR.

10:07.542 --> 10:08.625
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SENT THEM
TO ME

10:08.667 --> 10:10.041
IF ALL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
WAS A RUBBER STAMP.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.667
I WAS LOOKING FOR A SECOND
OPINION ABOUT THE MEDS,

10:11.709 --> 10:13.417
NOT SOME KIND OF JUDGMENT
ABOUT THEIR PARENTING.

10:13.458 --> 10:16.625
I MEAN, GRANTED, ROSIE IS
A BIT OF A TIGER MOM,

10:16.667 --> 10:18.458
AND THAT CAN BE OFF-PUTTING,
BUT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.417
I DON'T THINK
I GOT THE WHOLE STORY.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.291
OLLIE IS
A LITTLE BIT HYPERACTIVE,

10:22.333 --> 10:24.333
BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
HE CAN'T FOCUS.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.875
AND HIS ANSWERS
SEEMED COACHED...
OH.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.959
YOU KNOW, TO PUT IT MILDLY.
THE WHOLE THING WAS ODD.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.041
WHAT, PARENTS COACHED A KID SO
HE COULD SCORE A.D.H.D. DRUGS?

10:31.083 --> 10:32.041
SO SAYS SHELDON.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.542
I MEAN,
THESE ARE GOOD PARENTS.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.041
I'VE KNOWN THEM A LONG TIME.
THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.041
GOOD PEOPLE MAKE
TERRIBLE DECISIONS EVERY DAY.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.333
MY FIELD IS PRETTY MUCH
BASED ON THAT.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.875
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.041
THE DIAGNOSIS OF A.D.H.D.
IS EPIDEMIC IN THIS COUNTRY.

10:42.083 --> 10:43.583
WE ALL KNOW THE HYSTERIA,
PETE.

10:43.625 --> 10:45.041
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S NOT REAL

10:45.083 --> 10:46.542
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT OLLIE'S
FAKING IT OR WAS COACHED.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.500
OKAY, MAYBE THESE KIDS
ARE UNFOCUSED

10:48.542 --> 10:50.542
BECAUSE WE'RE PUMPING THEM
FULL OF CAFFEINE AND SUGAR

10:50.583 --> 10:51.542
AND PRESERVATIVES.

10:51.583 --> 10:52.917
WE SHOULD LOOK AT DIET
AND EXERCISE

10:52.959 --> 10:54.667
BEFORE WE JUST WRITE 'EM
A SCRIP FOR SPEED.

10:54.709 --> 10:56.166
A.D.H.D. DRUGS CAN BE
VERY EFFECTIVE,

10:56.208 --> 10:57.625
BUT THEY HAVE TO BE USED
SPARINGLY

10:57.667 --> 10:59.041
AND ONLY IN CLEAR-CUT CASES.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.417
OKAY, I JUST DON'T
SEE THAT HERE, COOPER.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.667
YEAH,
AND IF SHELDON IS RIGHT,

11:01.709 --> 11:03.583
THE PARENTS ARE COACHING
THEIR KID TO GET DRUGS,

11:03.625 --> 11:04.625
IT'S--IT'S CHILD ABUSE.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.417
I NEED SPERM.

11:06.458 --> 11:10.041
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
CHOOSE SPERM.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.041
I HAVE TO PICK A DONOR TODAY
AND...

11:12.083 --> 11:14.375
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
I NEED A CONSULT.

11:14.417 --> 11:17.500
CAN YOU ALL... JUST PLEASE
GIVE ME A CONSULT?

11:17.542 --> 11:18.500
A SPERM CONSULT?

11:18.542 --> 11:19.417
SHUT UP.

11:19.458 --> 11:22.625
PLEASE JUST SHUT UP
AND HELP ME.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.125
WHAT IS THIS,
FANTASY FOOTBALL?

11:36.166 --> 11:37.959
FANTASY SPERM BALL.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.583
REALLY?

11:39.625 --> 11:41.417
DON'T JUDGE.
I NEEDED HELP.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.041
(Cooper) ALL RIGHT. I SAY,
GO WITH THE HISTORIAN.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.417
HISTORY'S COOL.

11:44.458 --> 11:45.667
HOW IS HISTORY COOL?

11:45.709 --> 11:47.417
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE BABY
ISN'T NECESSARILY

11:47.458 --> 11:48.792
GOING TO BE AN HISTORIAN?

11:48.834 --> 11:50.750
YES, BUT THE HISTORIAN
IS GREEK,

11:50.792 --> 11:52.625
AND THEY HAVE SOME GOOD GENES.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.375
THEY NEVER SUNBURN, THE GREEKS.
THEY ONLY TAN.

11:54.417 --> 11:56.250
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD CHOOSE A DONOR

11:56.291 --> 11:58.667
BASED ON THE AMOUNT
OF MELANIN IN HIS SKIN?

11:58.709 --> 12:00.875
I MEAN, YOU'RE PALE AS A GHOST.
YOU WANT TO SPEND

12:00.917 --> 12:03.000
YOUR WHOLE KID'S LIFE
WORRYING ABOUT MELANOMA...
I THINK THAT'S VALID.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.166
I'D TEND TO AGREE.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.458
(sighs)

12:05.500 --> 12:07.041
ALL RIGHT.
TAKE DOWN THE SWEDE.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.500
(imitates Swedish accent)
YEAH, SURE. THE SWEDE IS GONE.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.667
OKAY, I THINK THE PhD

12:10.709 --> 12:12.041
IS GONNA BE TOO INTELLECTUAL.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.583
(Sheldon, normal voice)
WHAT'S WRONG WITH INTELLECTUAL?

12:13.625 --> 12:15.041
WELL, ADDISON IS FUN-LOVING.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.709
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SIT AROUND
ANALYZING EVERYTHING ALL DAY--

12:16.750 --> 12:18.041
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ADDISON
OR--

12:18.083 --> 12:19.875
OH, COME ON, SHELDON. I'M NOT
TALKING IN METAPHORS HERE.

12:19.917 --> 12:22.041
NOT CONSCIOUSLY, BUT YOU DID
JUST DESCRIBE YOUR WIFE.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.041
OKAY.
OOH.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.875
FOCUS, PEOPLE.
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

12:24.917 --> 12:26.500
NOW COME ON. LET'S DO THE PROS
AND CONS OF THE PRO ATHLETE.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.250
WELL, THERE--THERE ARE
NO CONS TO A PRO ATHLETE.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.709
WELL, THAT DEPENDS
WHAT SPORT HE PLAYED

12:29.750 --> 12:31.041
AND HOW MANY TIMES
HE GOT HIT IN THE HEAD.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.375
(Cooper) WHAT, YOU THINK
HIS CONCUSSION RATE

12:32.417 --> 12:33.834
IS DIRECTLY RELATED
TO HIS SPOOGE?

12:33.875 --> 12:35.709
CAN WE PLEASE
NOT CALL IT SPOOGE?

12:35.750 --> 12:38.625
YOU KNOW, PRO ATHLETES GENERALLY
RUN HIGH ON TESTOSTERONE.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.625
(Cooper and Pete) MM-HMM.
IF YOU HAD A BOY,
IT COULD BE HARD TO HANDLE.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.125
THEN YOU JUST
BRING HIM TO COOPER.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.041
HE'LL DOSE HIM UP ON
SOME HEAVY PHARMACEUTICALS...

12:44.083 --> 12:45.542
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU MAKE THIS
SO MUCH LESS FUN.
(speaks indistinctly)

12:45.583 --> 12:47.083
WHERE ARE THE WOMEN
IN THIS PRACTICE?

12:47.125 --> 12:48.500
WHERE? WHERE ARE THE WOMEN?

12:48.542 --> 12:50.041
OKAY, ADDISON,
YOU'RE OVERTHINKING THIS.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.458
OKAY, WHAT IF YOU MET SOME GUY
AT A BAR,

12:51.500 --> 12:52.917
AND YOU ACCIDENTALLY
GOT PREGNANT?
I'M WITH SAM.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.417
I MEAN, IF YOU WEREN'T.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.875
WOMEN GET PREGNANT EVERY DAY

12:55.917 --> 12:57.542
AND GIVE BIRTH TO BABIES
ALL THE TIME

12:57.583 --> 12:59.500
WITH GUYS WHO AMOUNT TO
LITTLE MORE THAN SPERM DONORS.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.041
LOOK AT COOPER WITH THIS KID
HE NEVER KNEW ABOUT.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.250
IT'S TRUE. ALTHOUGH,
ERICA KINDA DID HIT

13:03.291 --> 13:04.750
THE SPERM JACKPOT
WITH ME.

13:04.792 --> 13:06.041
MM. I VOTE FOR THE ACTIVIST,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.208
OH, YEAH, THEY'RE
VERY LEVEL-HEADED.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.458
OKAY.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.583
I VOTE FOR THE GREEK.

13:09.625 --> 13:10.583
OKAY.

13:10.625 --> 13:11.542
I'D GO WITH THE PhD.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.542
BUT I MIGHT JUST BE
SHINING A LIGHT

13:13.583 --> 13:15.792
ON MY OWN NARCISSISM.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.458
(sighs)

13:18.500 --> 13:20.458
LISTEN, YOU HAVE A LOT
OF LOVE TO GIVE,

13:20.500 --> 13:22.041
AND THAT'S ALL
YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.917
THE SPERM IS JUST...

13:23.959 --> 13:25.000
SPERM.

13:42.834 --> 13:45.041
EXCUSE ME.
THIS IS NOT PUBLIC PROPERTY.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.709
GET THE HELL OFF THE DECK.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.625
HEY, YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.041
HEY.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.291
YOU'RE STILL HERE.
YEAH.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.750
WELL, YOU THREW MY CLOTHES
AT ME THIS MORNING

13:53.792 --> 13:55.750
AND KICKED ME OUT,
WHICH WAS, UH, ACTUALLY...

13:55.792 --> 13:58.041
STRANGELY CHARMING.
(chuckles)

13:58.083 --> 14:00.417
UH, SO I THOUGHT I'D--
WHAT?

14:00.458 --> 14:01.792
I DON'T KNOW.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.166
UH...

14:03.208 --> 14:04.583
GET YOUR PHONE NUMBER?

14:04.625 --> 14:07.709
ALSO, I'M--I'M PRETTY SURE
I LEFT MY WALLET INSIDE.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.041
YOU HAVE A NAME?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.083
RYAN.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.875
RYAN KERRIGAN.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.333
AMELIA SHEPHERD.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.625
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

14:26.083 --> 14:29.041
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.875
(blows air)

14:32.667 --> 14:34.291
YOU COMING?

14:39.792 --> 14:41.750
(Mr. Graham)
OLLIE, COME ON! STOP!
(Ollie shouts indistinctly)

14:41.792 --> 14:44.041
NO! I DON'T WANT ANOTHER DOCTOR!
OLLIE, PLEASE CALM DOWN!

14:44.083 --> 14:45.041
COME ON.
(Rosie) OLLIE, STOP.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.041
STOP IT.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.041
OLLIE, CONTROL YOUR--
OH!

14:47.083 --> 14:48.041
OH, MY GOD.
OLLIE.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.458
YOU HIT YOUR FATHER.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.834
I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER DOCTOR!
IT'S OKAY.

14:50.875 --> 14:52.041
YOU DON'T NEED ANOTHER DOCTOR,
BUDDY. I'M HERE.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.500
OKAY, JUST BREATHE.
JUST BREATHE. IT'S OKAY.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.083
ANY CHANCE YOU WANT TO GIVE US
THAT PRESCRIPTION NOW?

14:55.125 --> 14:56.500
OH!

14:56.542 --> 14:59.250
(Amelia)
I LIKE YOU. YOU'RE FUN.

14:59.291 --> 15:00.917
YOU'RE FUN.

15:00.959 --> 15:03.041
I'M NOT FUN.
I'M AWESOME.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.041
(laughs)

15:04.083 --> 15:05.041
(chuckles)

15:05.083 --> 15:06.208
YOU ARE AWESOME.

15:06.250 --> 15:09.166
(laughs)

15:09.208 --> 15:11.375
COULD I ASK YOU KIND OF
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

15:11.417 --> 15:12.583
OKAY.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.875
WHERE DID WE MEET
LAST NIGHT?

15:14.917 --> 15:17.291
I HAVE ZERO MEMORY.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.875
(grunts)

15:23.083 --> 15:26.458
YEAH, YOU MIX THESE
WITH A FEW DRINKS,

15:26.500 --> 15:28.875
AND MEMORY SORT OF BECOMES
A THING OF THE PAST.

15:28.917 --> 15:30.083
DUDE, YOU HAD PARTY FAVORS
IN YOUR POCKET,

15:30.125 --> 15:33.041
AND YOU HELD OUT
THIS LONG?

15:33.083 --> 15:34.500
SO RUDE.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.917
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU REMEMBERED MY NAME.

15:35.959 --> 15:38.750
WHAT IS MY NAME?

15:38.792 --> 15:40.667
IT'S RYAN KERRIGAN.

15:40.709 --> 15:44.041
YOU PASSED.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.959
YOU GOT A RAZOR BLADE?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.041
THEY'RE MUCH BETTER
IF WE CHOP THEM UP.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.750
YEAH.

15:49.792 --> 15:52.041
RAZOR BLADE COMING UP.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.417
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS THIS BAD.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.041
THAT WAS MILD.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.041
THEY GET WORSE.

16:03.083 --> 16:05.000
HIS MIND IS RACING
ALL THE TIME.

16:05.041 --> 16:06.000
HE BARELY SLEEPS.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.041
(sighs)
IS HE HAVING, UM, SODA,

16:08.083 --> 16:10.041
OR ANY DESSERTS
RIGHT BEFORE HE GOES TO BED?

16:10.083 --> 16:11.917
'CAUSE THAT COULD ABSOLUTELY
INTERFERE WITH SLEEP.

16:11.959 --> 16:13.166
A LITTLE SUGAR
MAKES HIM DO THIS?

16:13.208 --> 16:14.291
(inhales deeply)

16:14.333 --> 16:15.959
I DON'T LIKE SODA
BEFORE BED.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.041
I DON'T LIKE TO EAT
SO MUCH ANYMORE.

16:18.083 --> 16:21.083
THE MEDICINE MAKES ME FEEL
NOT HUNGRY.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.375
OH, WHAT--
WHAT MEDICINE?

16:25.041 --> 16:26.458
OLLIE, GO TO
THE WAITING ROOM, OKAY?

16:26.500 --> 16:28.166
LET US TALK TO DR. FREEDMAN.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.166
AM I IN TROUBLE?
NO.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.333
NO, OLLIE,
YOU'RE NOT IN TROUBLE.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.041
WE JUST NEED TO TALK,
OKAY?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.291
(door opens)

16:38.333 --> 16:39.917
(door closes)

16:39.959 --> 16:41.834
WE HAD BRIAN'S MEDICATION.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.041
WE JUST THOUGHT WE WOULD SEE
IF IT HELPED.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.583
OH, PLEASE DON'T LOOK AT ME
THAT WAY, DR. FREEDMAN.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.750
WAS HE HAVING TANTRUMS LIKE THIS
BEFORE YOU STARTED GIVING HIM

16:47.792 --> 16:49.500
UNPRESCRIBED AMPHETAMINES?

16:49.542 --> 16:52.125
WITH A.D.H.D. KIDS,
THE DRUGS CALM THEM.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.041
SO IF HIS BRAIN
IS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY,

16:54.083 --> 16:55.041
OF COURSE HE'S AMPED UP.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.375
YOU'RE GIVING HIM SPEED.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.041
(Mr. Graham) WE THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD HELP HIM.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.041
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT.

16:59.083 --> 17:00.417
AND WHEN YOU SAW
THAT IT WASN'T?

17:00.458 --> 17:03.041
WE NEED HIM DIAGNOSED SO THAT HE
CAN GET EXTRA TIME ON HIS TESTS.

17:03.083 --> 17:06.041
HE NEEDS THE TIME.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.542
BRIAN WAS A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT
AFTER HIS DIAGNOSIS,

17:07.583 --> 17:09.792
BUT NOT BEFORE.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.458
OLLIE'S GRADES... (sighs)

17:11.500 --> 17:13.667
THEY'RE NOT
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE.

17:13.709 --> 17:14.875
HE'S IN THIRD GRADE.

17:14.917 --> 17:16.125
DR. FREEDMAN,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

17:16.166 --> 17:18.041
WHAT IT'S LIKE OUT THERE
THESE DAYS?

17:18.083 --> 17:20.250
WE'RE NOT WEALTHY PEOPLE,
BUT WE SPENT $12,000 A YEAR

17:20.291 --> 17:22.125
ON TUITION
FOR OLLIE'S PRESCHOOL.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.583
MORE FOR DONATIONS

17:23.625 --> 17:26.041
SO THAT THE RIGHT GRADE SCHOOL
WOULD CONSIDER US.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.542
WE DIDN'T GO THROUGH THAT,
WE DIDN'T SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY

17:29.583 --> 17:31.625
TO HAVE OLLIE UNDERPERFORM
IN GRADE SCHOOL,

17:31.667 --> 17:34.041
BECAUSE THEN HE WON'T GET IN
TO THE RIGHT HIGH SCHOOLS,

17:34.083 --> 17:35.417
AND WE CAN FORGET ABOUT
THE RIGHT COLLEGE.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.041
SO YOU TOOK
HIS BROTHER'S MEDICINE,

17:37.083 --> 17:39.041
YOU AMPED HIM UP
SO THAT I WOULD DIAGNOSE HIM

17:39.083 --> 17:41.417
SO YOU COULD CHEAT
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM?

17:41.458 --> 17:43.041
YOU SEE A THIRD GRADER.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.083
BUT I AM HIS MOTHER,

17:44.125 --> 17:47.417
AND I SEE HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
IN THAT REPORT CARD.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.417
YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP US?
FINE.

17:49.458 --> 17:52.750
BUT PLEASE, UNTIL YOU'VE
BEEN THERE, DON'T JUDGE US.

17:57.458 --> 18:00.792
AND IT'S REALLY
THE STRANGEST DECISION

18:00.834 --> 18:02.041
I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.083
YOU KNOW, AND I'M--I'M LOOKING
AT THESE BABY PICTURES,

18:04.125 --> 18:06.875
AND, UH, THESE
FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORIES

18:06.917 --> 18:08.083
AND PERSONALITY ASSESSMENTS,

18:08.125 --> 18:10.125
PROBABLY MADE
BY THE 21-YEAR-OLD INTERN

18:10.166 --> 18:14.083
WHO'S MANNING THE DESK
AT THE CRYOBANK THAT NIGHT

18:14.125 --> 18:16.083
WHEN THE 22-YEAR-OLD
SPERM DONOR

18:16.125 --> 18:20.041
COMES IN TO SELL HIS SPERM
FOR CASH. (laughs)

18:20.083 --> 18:22.834
IT'S, UH, IT'S REALLY
JUST DISTURBING IS WHAT IT IS.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.709
I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING
IS JUST SO--
FOUR.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.709
WHAT?

18:26.750 --> 18:28.041
FOUR.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.000
WE GOT FOUR.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.041
FOUR EGGS?

18:35.458 --> 18:37.041
I MADE FOUR EGGS.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.125
I MEAN, NORMALLY, I WOULD
WANT EIGHT OR TEN,

18:39.166 --> 18:40.709
BUT, UH...
WITH MY AGE, IT'S...

18:40.750 --> 18:43.041
AND YOUR F.S.H. LEVELS,
I MEAN, THIS IS--

18:43.083 --> 18:44.667
I THOUGHT I WAS
THE EGGLESS WONDER.

18:44.709 --> 18:47.041
WELL, YOU ARE NOT
THE EGGLESS WONDER.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.166
OH, MY GOD.

18:49.208 --> 18:50.959
OH, MY GOD. I'VE GOTTA, UM...

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
(snaps fingers)

18:52.041 --> 18:54.000
I HAVE TO PICK A DONOR,
RIGHT NOW.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.166
NO, NO, NO. RIGHT NOW
I NEED TO TAKE THESE EGGS

18:56.208 --> 18:57.542
BECAUSE YOU COULD START
OVULATING ANY MINUTE,

18:57.583 --> 18:58.959
AND I WANT TO GET THEM
BEFORE YOU DO.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.333
AND THEN
YOU CAN PICK A DONOR.

19:00.375 --> 19:01.500
IN FACT, I HAVE A FRIEND
AT THE CRYOBANK

19:01.542 --> 19:03.041
SO WE CAN GET
A SAME-DAY DELIVERY.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.041
OH, MY GOD. (laughs)

19:04.083 --> 19:05.041
(laughs)

19:05.083 --> 19:06.709
OH, MY GOSH.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.041
UH... WAIT. YOU'RE GONNA, UM,

19:09.083 --> 19:11.125
FERTILIZE TODAY?

19:11.166 --> 19:13.000
OH, I'M--
I'M KNOCKING YOU OUT NOW.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.291
OKAY.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.542
OKAY?

19:17.583 --> 19:20.375
OKAY.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.166
(sighs)

19:22.208 --> 19:24.041
(exhales)

19:24.083 --> 19:27.041
(exhales)

19:27.083 --> 19:29.041
(Charlotte)
WHY WOULD ANY PARENTS

19:29.083 --> 19:31.291
WANT THEIR KID SADDLED
WITH AN A.D.H.D. DIAGNOSIS?

19:31.333 --> 19:33.834
EXTENDED TIME
ON STANDARDIZED TESTS,

19:33.875 --> 19:35.166
MORE ATTENTION FROM TEACHERS.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.417
SO YOU GET THE KIDS
HOPPED UP ON DRUGS

19:36.458 --> 19:38.041
TO GET 'EM IN
TO A BETTER COLLEGE?

19:38.083 --> 19:39.291
I THINK WHEN THEY INITIALLY
STARTED GIVING HIM THE DRUGS,

19:39.333 --> 19:41.041
THEY REALLY THOUGHT
HE HAD A.D.H.D.

19:41.083 --> 19:42.083
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THEY WOULD GIVE--

19:42.125 --> 19:43.291
THOSE DRUGS ARE ADDICTIVE,
COOPER.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.291
THEY'RE NOT A TOY.
CALL THE DAMN POLICE.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.041
OKAY, I HEAR THAT.
I DO.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.083
BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM

19:49.125 --> 19:50.834
IS BEST FOR OLLIE.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.792
I GUESS I HEAR THAT, TOO.

19:52.834 --> 19:54.333
DR. KING, I HATE
TO BOTHER YOU, BUT I--

19:54.375 --> 19:55.333
YOU'RE NOT A BOTHER.

19:55.375 --> 19:56.458
I HAVE A PATIENT--
KELLY GARRITY.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.041
SHE'S DR. SHEPHERD'S PATIENT,

19:58.083 --> 19:59.041
AND SHE'S SHOWING

19:59.083 --> 20:00.417
AN ATYPICAL PREOPERATIVE
VISUAL FIELD DEFECT.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.125
IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE
A PITUITARY APOPLEXY,

20:02.166 --> 20:04.041
SHE'LL NEED EMERGENCY SURGERY
IMMEDIATELY.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.834
DR. SHEPHERD
WENT HOME SICK AND--

20:05.875 --> 20:07.625
SHE WHAT?
AMELIA'S SICK?

20:07.667 --> 20:09.333
COOPER, I LOVE YOU,
BUT GO AWAY.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.041
(indistinct conversations)

20:11.083 --> 20:13.041
AND SHE TOLD ME TO CALL HER
IF I NEEDED HER,

20:13.083 --> 20:14.250
BUT SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
HER PHONE,

20:14.291 --> 20:15.834
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT
THE PROTOCOL IS IF SHE'S NOT--

20:15.875 --> 20:17.041
I'LL FIND DR. SHEPHERD.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.375
YOU BOOK AN O.R.
JUST IN CASE WE NEED IT.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.166
YES, MA'AM.
THANK YOU.

20:24.625 --> 20:26.583
SO YOU HIT IT
ON THE CABINET?

20:26.625 --> 20:28.041
I JUST... STOOD UP
WITHOUT LOOKING.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.291
IT WAS STUPID.
KNOCKED MYSELF OUT.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.041
YOUR HUSBAND CALLED
THE AMBULANCE?

20:32.083 --> 20:33.208
I GUESS SO.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.041
SO WHERE IS HE?

20:35.083 --> 20:36.709
WHAT'S WITH THE 20 QUESTIONS,
ANDERSON?

20:36.750 --> 20:38.208
SORRY.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.083
I'M JUST SAYIN',
YOUR BEDSIDE MANNER NEEDS WORK.

20:40.125 --> 20:43.000
BUT I LEARNED FROM YOU.
HERE, TAKE A LOOK.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.792
THERE'S NO SIGN OF A BLEED,

20:44.834 --> 20:47.041
BUT THE LOSS OF CONSCIOUS,
THE PAIN, DIZZINESS...

20:47.083 --> 20:48.709
IT'S A CONCUSSION.
I GOT IT.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.000
AND AS YOU KNOW,
REST IS YOUR BEST BET.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.834
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED
TO STAY FOR OBSERVATION

20:52.875 --> 20:54.375
AS LONG AS YOUR HUSBAND
CAN HELP YOU OUT,

20:54.417 --> 20:55.458
KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.041
THINK YOU CAN RELY ON HIM
FOR THAT?

20:58.083 --> 21:00.166
I'LL BE FINE.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.750
CAN YOU WRITE ME SOMETHING
FOR PAIN?

21:01.792 --> 21:02.750
YEAH, OF COURSE.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.333
SOMETHING STRONG.

21:04.375 --> 21:05.917
GONNA NEED IT.

21:05.959 --> 21:07.250
YOU GOT IT.

21:09.125 --> 21:11.917
(exhales deeply)

21:13.041 --> 21:16.333
(buzzes)

21:16.375 --> 21:20.041
(buzz)

21:20.083 --> 21:21.667
(telephone rings)

21:21.709 --> 21:22.917
(cell phone buzzes)

21:22.959 --> 21:24.083
(telephone rings)

21:24.125 --> 21:25.250
(buzz)

21:25.291 --> 21:27.417
(ring)

21:27.458 --> 21:28.959
(buzz)

21:29.000 --> 21:29.959
(ring)

21:30.000 --> 21:31.166
(buzz)

21:31.208 --> 21:32.500
(ring)

21:32.542 --> 21:34.083
(buzz)

21:34.125 --> 21:36.000
(ring)

21:36.041 --> 21:37.250
(buzz)

21:37.291 --> 21:38.959
(ring)

21:39.000 --> 21:42.959
(buzz)

21:52.500 --> 21:54.083
(knocks)

21:54.125 --> 21:56.041
(lowered voice) HEY, IS IT
ALL RIGHT TO COME IN?

21:56.083 --> 21:58.041
OH, ABSOLUTELY. SHE'S, UH,
SHE'S ALREADY OUT, THOUGH.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.041
THAT'S OKAY.

22:00.083 --> 22:01.917
I JUST WANT TO SIT WITH HER.

22:01.959 --> 22:03.959
(chair wheels rattle)

22:06.583 --> 22:08.041
SO YOU GOT SOME EGGS, HUH?

22:08.083 --> 22:10.041
OH, YES, WE DID.

22:10.083 --> 22:12.291
FOUR OF 'EM.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.250
WOW.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.041
(sighs) THAT'S GREAT.

22:18.083 --> 22:19.625
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

22:19.667 --> 22:21.625
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:21.667 --> 22:23.375
IT'S ALL JUST KINDA...

22:23.417 --> 22:26.709
HALFWAY WITH YOU TWO,
ISN'T IT?

22:26.750 --> 22:28.041
WHAT?

22:28.083 --> 22:30.166
YOU SHOWED UP TO HOLD HER HAND,
BUT, UH,

22:30.208 --> 22:32.500
YOU WAITED
TILL SHE'S ALREADY OUT.

22:32.542 --> 22:34.291
SO SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU'RE HERE.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.750
I WAS RUNNING LATE.

22:35.792 --> 22:37.458
OKAY. (chuckles)

22:37.500 --> 22:39.041
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY?

22:39.083 --> 22:40.458
I ALREADY SAID IT, SAM.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.959
IT'S ALL HALFWAY.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.250
I MEAN, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE STAYING WITH HER,

22:44.291 --> 22:46.041
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO PARENT
WITH HER.

22:46.083 --> 22:48.041
IT'S ONE OF THE STRANGER PLANS
I'VE EVER HEARD OF.

22:48.083 --> 22:49.542
I LOVE HER.
OH, I GET THAT.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.041
YEAH, IT'S JUST BAD TIMING.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.250
I GET THAT, TOO.

22:52.291 --> 22:55.041
(beeping continues)

22:55.083 --> 22:57.583
I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT WORK.

22:57.625 --> 22:59.041
(beeping continues)

22:59.083 --> 23:00.208
OKAY.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.417
IT'S NOT HALFWAY.

23:02.458 --> 23:04.125
IT'S JUST...

23:04.166 --> 23:07.208
(beeping continues)

23:07.250 --> 23:09.041
IT'S HALFWAY.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.375
(beeping continues)

23:10.417 --> 23:12.417
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
MY MARRIAGE.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.500
I'M WORRIED ABOUT AMELIA.

23:15.542 --> 23:17.291
WELL, I'M NOT YOUR THERAPIST.
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.375
AND THAT MEANS I GET TO
TALK ABOUT MY STUFF, TOO.

23:20.417 --> 23:23.041
WELL, YEAH, OKAY.
OKAY, YOU GO FIRST.

23:23.083 --> 23:24.875
(sighs)

23:25.959 --> 23:27.417
(sighs)

23:27.458 --> 23:29.375
I HARDLY EVER HEAR
FROM HER.

23:29.417 --> 23:31.417
SINCE MICHELLE DIED,
SHE'S GONE INTO HIDING.

23:31.458 --> 23:33.166
AND I-I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER.

23:33.208 --> 23:34.458
WORRIED HOW?

23:34.500 --> 23:36.041
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER
LIKE I THINK ABOUT HER

23:36.083 --> 23:37.667
PRETTY MUCH ALL THE TIME,

23:37.709 --> 23:40.291
AND WHEN I GET A TEXT MESSAGE,
I WILL IT TO BE FROM HER,

23:40.333 --> 23:42.417
AND IT NEVER IS, AND I...

23:42.458 --> 23:43.917
WANT TO CHECK ON HER.

23:43.959 --> 23:45.959
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO CHECK ON HER
ABOUT 15 TIMES A DAY.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.041
BUT I... (sighs)

23:48.083 --> 23:49.750
I DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM TO HER.

23:49.792 --> 23:51.291
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M JUST A COLLEAGUE

23:51.333 --> 23:53.041
OR A FRIEND.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.333
I...

23:54.375 --> 23:56.542
I THINK ABOUT HER ALL DAY

23:56.583 --> 24:00.625
AND I'M PRETTY CERTAIN
THAT'S NOT RECIPROCAL.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.917
ALL RIGHT.
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE.

24:03.959 --> 24:06.041
REALLY? 'CAUSE I WAS JUST
GONNA GIVE YOU

24:06.083 --> 24:08.500
SOME PROFOUND INSIGHT
ON THIS WHOLE AMELIA THING.
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT IT,

24:08.542 --> 24:09.875
SO JUST--
YOU'RE
MORE COMFORTABLE LISTENING.

24:09.917 --> 24:11.041
IS THAT IT?
PETE, PLEASE. CAN WE--

24:11.083 --> 24:12.291
O-O-OKAY, OKAY.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.625
UH, YOU KNOW, I-I TRIED
TO DO WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

24:14.667 --> 24:18.250
I TRIED TO REMEMBER
ALL THE REASONS I MARRIED HER.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.250
BUT I'M OVERWHELMED
WITH THIS FEELING OF--

24:20.291 --> 24:22.875
THAT--I-I DON'T KNOW.
I-I DON'T TRUST HER.

24:22.917 --> 24:24.041
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

24:24.083 --> 24:26.000
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT

24:26.041 --> 24:27.542
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
I THINK TO SAY

24:27.583 --> 24:29.041
SOUNDS LIKE AN ACCUSATION.

24:29.083 --> 24:30.709
(inhales and exhales)

24:30.750 --> 24:32.750
(chuckles) THAT SUCKS.

24:34.041 --> 24:35.834
WOW.
THAT'S YOUR INSIGHT?

24:37.500 --> 24:38.417
YEAH.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.500
(indistinct conversations)

24:42.542 --> 24:44.542
DR. KING, I HAVE
AN UPDATE ON KELLY GARRITY.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.041
THE PITUITARY ADENOMA
IS BLEEDING

24:46.083 --> 24:47.750
AND THE BLOOD IS COMPRESSING
THE OPTICAL CHIASM.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.375
WELL,
HOW'D IT START BLEEDING?

24:49.417 --> 24:51.500
AND HOW THE HELL
DID DR. SHEPHERD MISS IT?

24:51.542 --> 24:53.208
IT'S UNPREDICTABLE. THE PROBLEM
IS, THE NERVE WILL DIE

24:53.250 --> 24:54.417
IF THE BLOOD COMPRESSES IT
FOR TOO LONG.

24:54.458 --> 24:55.417
WE HAVE ABOUT 30 MINUTES

24:55.458 --> 24:57.041
BEFORE SHE LOSES HER VISION
PERMANENTLY.

24:57.083 --> 24:58.417
HAVE YOU DONE
THIS SURGERY BEFORE?

24:58.458 --> 25:00.625
NO, MA'AM, BUT I HAVE WATCHED
SEVERAL AND ASSISTED TWICE.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.792
I FEEL CONFIDENT
THAT GIVEN THE OPP--

25:01.834 --> 25:03.083
SHUT UP
AND PAGE DR. SHEPHERD AGAIN,

25:03.125 --> 25:05.542
THEN PREP THE PATIENT,
GET SCRUBBED, AND STAND BY.

25:05.583 --> 25:06.792
YES, MA'AM.
THANK YOU.

25:06.834 --> 25:08.083
(sighs)

25:08.125 --> 25:11.500
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

25:11.542 --> 25:15.166
(indistinct conversations)

25:15.208 --> 25:16.166
HEY THERE.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.208
HEY. EXCUSE ME.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.625
ANDERSON--
NO.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.375
IT STILL HURTS.
CHARLOTTE.

25:21.417 --> 25:22.500
IT'S CALLED
POST-CONCUSSION SYNDROME.

25:22.542 --> 25:23.917
CHARLOTTE, IT'S BEEN MONTHS.

25:23.959 --> 25:25.041
IT'S TOO LONG.
IT'S TOO MANY REFILLS.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.542
PLEASE DON'T JUDGE
MY HEALING PROCESS.

25:26.583 --> 25:27.583
I'M IN PAIN.

25:27.625 --> 25:29.041
I JUST NEED
SOME MORE PAINKILLERS.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.542
IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.041
FINE. I'LL WRITE YOU
SOMETHING LIGHTER.

25:32.083 --> 25:33.458
DAMN IT, ANDERSON.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.458
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME?

25:35.500 --> 25:36.583
THIS STUFF IS ADDICTIVE.

25:36.625 --> 25:37.834
YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW THAT, TOO?

25:37.875 --> 25:39.583
LOOK AT ME. DO I LOOK LIKE
AN ADDICT TO YOU?

25:39.625 --> 25:41.041
OR DO I LOOK LIKE A PERSON

25:41.083 --> 25:42.750
WHO'S SHOWING UP FOR WORK
EVERY DAY,

25:42.792 --> 25:44.375
DOING MY JOB, DESPITE
THE STAGGERING HEADACHES

25:44.417 --> 25:46.375
THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU
ARE CAUSING ME?

25:46.417 --> 25:48.625
(chuckles) I BUMPED MY HEAD
AGAIN YESTERDAY.

25:48.667 --> 25:50.625
SAME CABINET, SAME SPOT.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.041
HURT LIKE HELL.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.333
IT WAS STUPID. I'M HAVING
THAT CABINET REMOVED THIS WEEK.

25:54.375 --> 25:56.375
NOW JUST, PLEASE,
WRITE THE SCRIP FOR ME.

25:56.417 --> 25:58.041
ALL RIGHT?

25:58.083 --> 26:00.709

27:26.625 --> 27:28.583

29:14.959 --> 29:16.000
HE'S POUTING.

29:16.041 --> 29:17.291
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

29:17.333 --> 29:20.041
I GAVE HIM 15 MINUTES

29:20.083 --> 29:21.834

STRAIGHT A's.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.125
AH.

STRAIGHT A's, TOO.

29:35.083 --> 29:37.625

UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING REAL,

29:49.750 --> 29:50.709
BUT, YEAH, A "B" PLUS?

29:50.750 --> 29:52.375
