00:38.744 --> 00:40.814
Here's my day, so far.

00:40.815 --> 00:44.893
Went to jail, lost the girl of my
dreams and got my butt kicked.

00:44.901 --> 00:46.126
Pretty good.

00:46.669 --> 00:49.745
Still, things could be a lot worse.

00:50.642 --> 00:54.637
Oh, that's right, I'm falling
to my death.

00:55.329 --> 00:56.785
Guess they can't.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.406
How did it all come
to this, you ask?

01:00.644 --> 01:02.419
My end starts at the beginning.

01:02.778 --> 01:04.638
The very beginning.

01:08.295 --> 01:10.051
Yes, that's me.

01:10.787 --> 01:13.676
I had a fairly standard childhood.

01:14.566 --> 01:17.629
I came from what you might call,
a broken home.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.034
Literally, broken.

01:21.038 --> 01:24.258
I was eight days old and still living
with my parents.

01:24.897 --> 01:26.305
How sad is that?

01:26.727 --> 01:28.799
Clearly it was time to move on.

01:28.803 --> 01:32.047
Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you.

01:32.054 --> 01:33.808
And here is your binkie.

01:33.956 --> 01:37.024
You are destined for ...

01:37.029 --> 01:38.838
I didn't quite hear that last part.

01:38.841 --> 01:40.479
But it sounded important.

01:40.521 --> 01:43.210
Destined for, what?

01:45.055 --> 01:47.994
I set out to find my destiny.

01:49.481 --> 01:53.671
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt
quadrant had the exact same idea.

02:00.724 --> 02:03.876
That was the day I met,
Mr. Goody-two-shoes.

02:06.758 --> 02:11.305
And our glorious rivalry,
was born!

02:16.022 --> 02:18.424
Could this be what I was destined for?

02:18.811 --> 02:21.297
A dream life filled with luxury?

02:23.379 --> 02:24.602
Apparently not.

02:25.819 --> 02:28.492
Even fate picks its favorites.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.457
No big deal.

02:30.837 --> 02:33.824
A much different fate awaited me.

02:41.755 --> 02:43.085
A baby.

02:43.348 --> 02:44.717
How thoughtful.

02:44.724 --> 02:48.116
Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you.

02:48.677 --> 02:51.905
Luckily I found a lovely little
place to call home.

02:52.014 --> 02:53.329
Can we keep it?

02:53.959 --> 02:57.389
A place that taught me the
differences between right...

02:57.586 --> 02:59.117
...and wrong.

02:59.586 --> 03:02.080
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand,

03:02.084 --> 03:04.654
had life handed to him on a silver platter.

03:04.658 --> 03:06.081
Our baby can fly.

03:06.085 --> 03:09.608
Yes, yes. Nothing but the best for you, Darling.

03:09.615 --> 03:14.014
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.

03:14.973 --> 03:17.920
But I had something far, far greater,

03:17.924 --> 03:19.552
My amazing intellect.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.729
A knack for building objects of mayhem.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.088
After a few years, and with some time
off for good behavior.

03:32.715 --> 03:36.417
I was given an opportunity to better
myself through learning.

03:36.893 --> 03:40.114
At a strange place called shh-ool.

03:40.444 --> 03:44.520
It was there that I once again ran into
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.

03:44.546 --> 03:48.623
He had already amassed a gigantic army of
soft-headed groupies.

03:55.111 --> 04:00.064
He bought their affections with showmanship,
and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.

04:01.803 --> 04:07.025
So I too would make this 'popped-corn'
and win over those mindless dregs.

04:07.033 --> 04:08.045
Lights out!

04:25.939 --> 04:28.514
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.

04:28.523 --> 04:31.349
Good receives all the praise and adulation.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.373
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.049
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.

04:39.356 --> 04:42.683
While they were learning the itsy
bitsy spider.

04:42.689 --> 04:45.401
I learned how to dehydrate
animate objects.

04:45.406 --> 04:47.370
and rehydrate them at will.

04:48.434 --> 04:53.450
Some day’s it felt like it was just me and Minion,
against the world.

04:54.353 --> 04:56.599
No matter how hard I tried.

04:56.603 --> 04:58.788
I was always the odd man out.

04:58.792 --> 05:00.662
The last one picked.

05:00.666 --> 05:03.195
The screw-up, the black sheep.

05:04.193 --> 05:06.448
The bad boy.

05:14.316 --> 05:15.319
Oh!

05:17.690 --> 05:19.477
Was this my destiny?

05:19.839 --> 05:22.523
Wait! Maybe it was.

05:23.363 --> 05:26.338
Being bad is the one thing
I'm good at.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.238
Then it hit me.

05:28.431 --> 05:30.847
If I was the bad boy.

05:30.851 --> 05:34.882
Then I was going to be the baddest
boy of them all.

05:36.615 --> 05:38.765
I was destined to be a super villain.

05:38.766 --> 05:42.116
And we were destined to be rivals.

05:43.133 --> 05:45.185
The die had been cast.

05:45.188 --> 05:49.456
And so began an enduring epic,
life long career.

05:49.465 --> 05:51.702
And I loved it.

05:53.310 --> 05:56.175
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

05:56.306 --> 06:00.928
He would win some, I would almost
win others.

06:01.081 --> 06:03.706
He took the name, Metro Man.

06:03.714 --> 06:05.909
Defender of Montrosity.

06:05.910 --> 06:08.629
I decided to pick something a
little more humble.

06:08.634 --> 06:09.699
Megamind.

06:10.132 --> 06:14.598
Incredibly handsome criminal genius,
and master of all villainy.

06:25.764 --> 06:28.356
Read on your own time. Open up.

06:35.005 --> 06:36.005
Hey!

06:36.010 --> 06:37.052
BOO!!

06:40.590 --> 06:42.241
Oh, good morning, Warden.

06:42.242 --> 06:44.885
Great news, I'm a changed man.

06:44.886 --> 06:48.928
And I'm ready to re-enter society
as a solid citizen.

06:48.931 --> 06:51.684
You're a villain, and you'll always
be a villain.

06:51.685 --> 06:53.051
You'll never change.

06:53.052 --> 06:54.656
And you'll never leave.

06:54.657 --> 06:57.608
-You're fun.
-You got a present in the mail.

06:57.609 --> 06:59.268
Is it a puppy?

06:59.276 --> 07:04.007
From Metro Man. To count every second
of your 85 life sentences.

07:04.063 --> 07:07.192
That's funny, never thought Metro Man
was the gloating type.

07:07.442 --> 07:09.070
Oh but he does have nice taste.

07:09.072 --> 07:10.472
I think I'll keep it.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.490
Any chance you could give me the time?

07:12.492 --> 07:15.787
I don't want to be late for the opening
of the Metro Man museum.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.416
Oh no, looks like you're
gonna miss it.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.504
By several thousand years.

07:23.047 --> 07:25.863
Oh, am I?

07:29.062 --> 07:32.118
Happy Metro Man day, Metro City.

07:34.568 --> 07:40.120
It's a beautiful day in beautiful downtown where
we're here to honor a beautiful man.

07:40.288 --> 07:41.896
Metro Man.

07:41.950 --> 07:46.269
His heart is an ocean that's inside
a bigger ocean.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.571
For years he's been watching us
with his super-vision.

07:49.852 --> 07:54.519
Saving us with his super strength,
and caring for us with his super heart.

07:54.523 --> 07:57.166
Now it's our turn to give something back.

07:57.638 --> 08:02.141
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from
the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.

08:02.619 --> 08:05.032
Wow, okay, the stuff they make
you read on the air.

08:05.033 --> 08:07.422
That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy.

08:07.423 --> 08:09.243
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

08:09.777 --> 08:11.385
What I was trying to say was,

08:11.386 --> 08:17.100
I can't believe that in our modern society
they let like actual art get onto the news.

08:17.101 --> 08:20.369
-Nice save, Hal.
-What are we, like lets just get
a coffee or something.

08:20.370 --> 08:23.459
Come on, it's time to get in the
Metro Man day spirit.

08:23.460 --> 08:27.097
Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind
wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.

08:27.098 --> 08:28.467
That's the first thing.

08:28.871 --> 08:29.922
That's sweet of you.

08:29.923 --> 08:33.090
And I'd be watching you, like
a dingo watches a human baby.

08:33.091 --> 08:35.672
-Mmm.
-Okay, that sounded, Okay that
sounded a little weird.

08:35.673 --> 08:36.875
A little bit, yeah.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.357
And you're making a weird face,
and that's making me feel weird.

08:43.111 --> 08:45.399
Not love, we're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.009
Okay, I love you, whatever.
I'm not saying like I'm in love with you.

08:48.390 --> 08:51.815
I'm saying...Roxanne?
Roxaroo?

09:06.870 --> 09:08.102
Get back to work.

09:08.272 --> 09:10.288
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

09:10.707 --> 09:12.056
-Freeze!
-Whoa, what are you doing, guys?

09:12.057 --> 09:14.160
It's ME! It's the Warden.

09:14.826 --> 09:16.153
Hey, open up.

09:23.815 --> 09:26.394
Oh, you fools. He's tricked us.

09:26.395 --> 09:27.947
You were right.

09:29.435 --> 09:31.152
I'll always be a villain.

09:31.621 --> 09:34.790
<i>*George Thorogood's 'Bad to the Bone'*</i>

09:36.129 --> 09:40.590
<i>*Bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone.*</i>

09:40.591 --> 09:45.495
<i>*B..B..B..Bad.
B..B..B..Bad.*</i>

09:45.499 --> 09:49.030
<i>*Bad to the bone.*</i>

09:49.141 --> 09:51.603
Well hello good looking, need a lift?

09:51.613 --> 09:54.048
Certainly do, you fantastic fish you.

09:54.049 --> 09:55.938
Get in the car, you.

09:56.118 --> 09:57.714
Whoo, I'm free.

09:59.544 --> 10:01.673
Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion.

10:01.674 --> 10:02.895
You got it, boss.

10:03.595 --> 10:04.647
Punch it.

10:05.596 --> 10:08.481
All right, put your hands in the air.

10:12.555 --> 10:16.089
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.364
-Who's your Man?
-Metro man.

10:19.768 --> 10:22.558
Yeah, Metro City!

10:25.118 --> 10:28.423
Give me some, come on give it now.
Give it to me. What?

10:28.428 --> 10:30.323
Give it to me...all right!

10:32.416 --> 10:35.994
Yo, hey, ha, ha yo.

10:48.006 --> 10:49.424
Hey, Metro city.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.285
Hello, hey.

10:53.664 --> 10:55.939
You know, I just want you to bring it down a bit.

10:56.185 --> 10:57.312
Boys, a little lower.

10:57.315 --> 10:58.715
Thank you fellows.

10:58.716 --> 11:01.148
Let's get real for a moment.

11:01.485 --> 11:04.244
That's right, that's right
ha, ha, that's right.

11:04.457 --> 11:06.835
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.

11:06.836 --> 11:11.123
Super cool, you want to know what the
greatest honor you've given me is?

11:11.388 --> 11:12.802
Do you really want to know?

11:13.237 --> 11:14.336
Really?

11:15.214 --> 11:16.555
I'll tell you.

11:16.748 --> 11:19.433
The greatest honor you've given me is...

11:19.434 --> 11:21.274
...letting me serve you.

11:21.504 --> 11:23.084
To help these people in Metro city.

11:23.331 --> 11:24.741
And at the end of every day.

11:24.816 --> 11:26.235
Well.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.078
I often ask myself.

11:29.107 --> 11:32.273
Who would I be, without you?

11:32.274 --> 11:33.285
I love you Metro Man!

11:33.286 --> 11:35.110
And I love you, random citizen.

11:43.025 --> 11:47.210
I tell you Minion, there's no
place like evil lair.

11:47.211 --> 11:50.762
I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.146
How do I look, Minion?

11:53.266 --> 11:56.268
-Do I look bad?
-Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

11:56.269 --> 11:57.955
You always know what to say.

11:57.956 --> 12:00.223
All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.

12:00.224 --> 12:02.856
Did you miss your daddy?
Whose the menacing little brains?

12:02.858 --> 12:06.845
You are, yes you are. Uh, uh!
No biting, no, no, no.

12:07.010 --> 12:10.979
-No, no, no. You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.
-Oh, look at that.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.520
Now, back to work.

12:22.543 --> 12:24.847
She's awake,
Quick, to work.

12:35.192 --> 12:39.421
-Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
-Would it kill you to wash the bag?

12:39.422 --> 12:43.557
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.008
Wha..why isn't she screaming?

12:47.009 --> 12:49.366
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind.

12:49.367 --> 12:51.121
Like this...AHHHHH!

12:51.122 --> 12:52.824
That's, that's a poor ladies scream.

12:52.829 --> 12:55.483
-AHHHHH!!!
-It's a little better.

12:58.525 --> 13:01.060
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website,

13:01.061 --> 13:04.353
where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials?

13:04.354 --> 13:06.983
Actually most of it comes from an
outlet store in...

13:06.984 --> 13:08.160
Don't answer that.

13:09.290 --> 13:10.566
...Romania.

13:10.567 --> 13:13.668
Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey
reporter skills,

13:13.669 --> 13:17.517
on your weak willed mind to find
out all our secrets.

13:18.666 --> 13:23.718
Such tricks...won't work...
on me.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.343
-Please talk slower
-Temptress.

13:25.344 --> 13:28.576
What secrets? You're so predictable.

13:28.577 --> 13:30.772
Predictable, predictable?

13:30.773 --> 13:34.531
Oh, you call THIS predictable?

13:34.532 --> 13:36.671
Your Alligators, yes.

13:37.414 --> 13:39.324
I was thinking about it on the way over.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.835
What's this? BOOM!

13:41.836 --> 13:44.424
-In your face.
-Cliché.

13:44.425 --> 13:45.457
No, look, watch.

13:46.315 --> 13:47.319
Juvenile.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.408
-Shuck it all!
-Tacky

13:49.410 --> 13:51.466
-Oh, so sorry.
-Seen it.

13:51.467 --> 13:53.320
-What's this one do?
-Garish.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.382
Okay, the spiders new.

13:56.778 --> 13:57.845
Spider?

14:01.455 --> 14:02.639
Ee, Uh, yes!

14:02.642 --> 14:08.584
The "spee..ider". Even the smallest bite
from arachnis deathicus

14:08.585 --> 14:10.985
Will instantly paralyze...OW!

14:11.151 --> 14:12.301
Get it off!

14:12.302 --> 14:15.950
Ow!
-Give it up, Megamind. Your plans never work.

14:17.493 --> 14:20.891
Let's stop wasting time and call your
boyfriend in tights, shall we?

14:22.108 --> 14:23.619
OOOWWW!

14:23.620 --> 14:28.217
It is with great pleasure that I present to
Metro Man, this new museum.

14:28.218 --> 14:29.502
If you please.

14:37.471 --> 14:39.618
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.

15:01.861 --> 15:06.599
-Megamind.
-Oh, bravo Metro Man.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.068
Booooo!

15:10.070 --> 15:12.051
Yes, I can play along too.

15:12.052 --> 15:13.077
Booooo.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.551
Should have known you'd try
to crash the party.

15:15.552 --> 15:17.696
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.

15:17.697 --> 15:23.506
This is the day you and Montrosity,
shall not soon forget.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.025
It's pronounced Metro City!

15:26.026 --> 15:28.783
Oh, potato, tomato,
potato, tomato.

15:28.784 --> 15:30.130
We all know how this ends.

15:30.131 --> 15:32.008
With you behind bars.

15:32.009 --> 15:36.124
Oh, I'm shaking in my custom
baby seal-leather boots.

15:36.125 --> 15:38.242
You will leave, Montrosity.

15:38.244 --> 15:41.030
Or this will be the last
you ever hear of,

15:41.031 --> 15:42.999
Roxanne Ritchi!

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
-Huh?
-Roxanne!

15:45.001 --> 15:48.311
-Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way.
-I'm not panicking.

15:48.312 --> 15:52.329
In order to stop me, You need to
find me first, Metro Man.

15:52.330 --> 15:53.912
We're at the abandoned observatory.

15:53.913 --> 15:56.151
-Ah ha.
-NO! No we're not!

15:56.152 --> 15:58.275
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

16:19.842 --> 16:21.818
Metro Man approaching, sir.

16:21.819 --> 16:23.438
-HAH!
-Hah, hah!

16:23.441 --> 16:24.678
Hah, hah, hah.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.601
Hold on a second.

16:49.913 --> 16:51.679
Oh, good heavens.

16:51.683 --> 16:56.164
You didn't think you were in the real
observatory, did you?

17:01.706 --> 17:03.612
Ready the death ray, Minion.

17:03.613 --> 17:05.261
Death ray, readying.

17:09.132 --> 17:10.673
Over here, old friend.

17:10.676 --> 17:11.946
In case you haven't noticed,

17:11.948 --> 17:14.294
You've fallen right into my trap.

17:14.295 --> 17:17.201
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.

17:17.207 --> 17:20.791
Even the most heartfelt belief,
can be corroded over time.

17:20.798 --> 17:22.583
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.

17:22.586 --> 17:25.196
But metals can be melted by the
heat of 're-vange'.

17:25.203 --> 17:27.328
It's 'revenge' and it's best
served cold.

17:27.330 --> 17:30.393
But it can be easily reheated, in the
microwave of evil.

17:30.398 --> 17:31.788
Well I think your warranty is about
to expire.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.617
Maybe I got an extended warranty?

17:33.622 --> 17:36.551
Warranties are invalid if you don't use
the product for its intended purpose.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.786
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?

17:39.798 --> 17:46.240
Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand
the full concentrated power of the...SUN!

17:46.900 --> 17:48.204
FIRE!

17:58.198 --> 17:59.670
Minion, fire...

17:59.673 --> 18:01.867
Uh, it's still warming up, sir.

18:01.871 --> 18:03.313
-Come again?
-Warming up, sir.

18:03.317 --> 18:06.144
Warming up?
The sun is warming up?

18:06.148 --> 18:08.680
One...sssecond...more.

18:08.685 --> 18:10.998
aaannnd....jussst.

18:11.002 --> 18:15.161
Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap,
tip top more.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.892
-Honestly.
-And we are ready, in just.

18:17.898 --> 18:20.108
Oh! I told you to have things ready.

18:20.109 --> 18:22.036
I told you countless times.

18:22.036 --> 18:23.373
Why do you always blame me?

18:23.374 --> 18:25.854
My spider bite is acting.

18:25.858 --> 18:28.321
Your plan is failing,
just admit it.

18:28.326 --> 18:30.030
Yeah, good luck with that one.

18:30.031 --> 18:31.893
Whose side are you on?

18:31.894 --> 18:33.164
The losing side.

18:33.165 --> 18:36.048
-Thank you.
-Uh, could someone stamp my
frequent kidnapping card?

18:38.781 --> 18:42.837
You of all people, know we
discontinued that promotion.

18:42.970 --> 18:45.329
-Chow, chow all.
-Same time next week?

18:50.061 --> 18:51.671
What did he just say?

18:51.681 --> 18:53.238
Crab nuggets?

18:57.605 --> 18:59.868
Good lord, I'm trapped.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.632
What kind of trickery is this?

19:01.639 --> 19:06.921
You mad genius.
Your dark gift has finally paid off.

19:06.929 --> 19:08.201
It, it has?

19:08.203 --> 19:12.379
This dome is obviously lined with copper.

19:12.381 --> 19:15.013
-Yeah, so?
-Sir!

19:15.014 --> 19:17.449
Copper drains my powers.

19:17.450 --> 19:19.675
Your weakness is copper?

19:19.676 --> 19:21.372
You're kidding, right?

19:47.163 --> 19:50.403
I don't think even he could
survive that.

19:50.943 --> 19:54.647
Well, lets not get our hopes up
just yet.

19:55.136 --> 19:56.996
-Look!
-Metro Man.

19:57.007 --> 19:59.545
Metro Man...

19:59.553 --> 20:01.339
Metro Man! AHHH!

20:09.274 --> 20:11.695
Oh god! Oh my god, oh!

20:12.897 --> 20:14.457
Ewwww.

20:17.193 --> 20:18.992
You did it, sir.

20:18.995 --> 20:20.211
I did it?

20:23.495 --> 20:24.955
He did it.

20:24.956 --> 20:26.372
I did it.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.891
He did it.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.903
-You did it, sir.
-I did it!

20:29.907 --> 20:31.244
-You did it.
-I did it!

20:31.391 --> 20:34.240
Montrocity is mine!

20:34.241 --> 20:39.795
You did it sir, you did it, sir.
Yes you did.

20:39.797 --> 20:43.866
All right people, hit it.

20:50.114 --> 20:51.411
Hit it!

21:10.359 --> 21:14.236
<i>*Living easy, living free.*</i>

21:14.237 --> 21:18.129
<i>*Season ticket on a one way ride.*</i>

21:18.130 --> 21:22.937
<i>*Don't need reason, don’t need rhyme*</i>

21:22.938 --> 21:26.566
<i>*-Ain't got nothing I'd rather do.*
Drop 'em.</i>

21:26.568 --> 21:35.354
<i>*Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too,*</i>

21:36.326 --> 21:39.336
<i>*I'm on the Highway to...*</i>

21:40.620 --> 21:45.792
-Highway..
-La, la, la, la, la...

21:45.793 --> 21:48.796
-Highway..
-Ahh, ahh, ahh....

21:52.767 --> 21:54.885
First off, what a turnout.

21:54.889 --> 21:57.092
How wild is this, huh?

21:58.771 --> 22:02.891
All I did was eliminate the most
powerful man in the universe.

22:02.898 --> 22:04.295
Are there any questions?

22:04.298 --> 22:06.926
Come on..yes?
You in the back.

22:06.930 --> 22:10.469
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan
to do with us.

22:10.475 --> 22:11.950
And the city.

22:11.951 --> 22:13.501
Good, I'm glad you asked that one.

22:13.505 --> 22:19.665
Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying
evil thing you could possibly think of.

22:20.123 --> 22:23.745
And multiply it by...SIX!

22:24.941 --> 22:31.089
In the mean time I want you to carry on,
with the dreary normal things you,

22:31.099 --> 22:32.871
Normal people do.

22:32.874 --> 22:35.101
Let's just have fun with this, come on.

22:35.105 --> 22:37.695
And I will get back to you.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.653
Now slam the door, really hard.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.689
They can...they can still see you.

22:47.696 --> 22:49.217
Now?
Yeah, you're still there.

22:49.219 --> 22:50.867
Oh, let's get going.

22:54.871 --> 22:59.332
<i>There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.</i>

22:59.332 --> 23:00.403
Ahh, Minion.

23:00.404 --> 23:02.729
Did you think this day would ever come?

23:02.730 --> 23:07.725
No way, not at all, sir. Never,
never in a million, I mean...

23:07.932 --> 23:09.612
Yes, I did.

23:09.615 --> 23:11.475
Look at the intricate moon links.

23:11.483 --> 23:13.814
I'm looking, I'm looking.

23:13.819 --> 23:15.533
And what's this?

23:15.571 --> 23:19.130
Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.978
But it seems to only carry one station.

23:21.981 --> 23:25.231
Oh, that sir is called a window.

23:25.241 --> 23:28.148
-Window...
-All the kids are looking through them.

23:28.153 --> 23:31.730
Oooo, I've never had a view before.

23:32.101 --> 23:35.363
Montrosity Minion, it's all mine.

23:35.369 --> 23:38.676
If my parents could see me now.

23:38.678 --> 23:42.635
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down
from evil heaven.

23:42.857 --> 23:46.578
Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out
of the way.

23:46.584 --> 23:49.663
I  can have, everything I want!

23:49.674 --> 23:52.239
And  there's no one to stop me.

23:52.240 --> 23:55.774
<i>*All aboard! Ha, ha, haaaa...*</i>

23:55.775 --> 24:01.846
<i>*Mental wounds healing,
Driving me insane.*</i>

24:01.847 --> 24:06.873
<i>*I'm going off the rails,
on a crazy train.*</i>

24:09.064 --> 24:13.864
<i>*I'm going off the rails,
on a crazy train.*</i>

24:15.948 --> 24:20.576
<i>*We may as well go home, as I did on my own.*</i>

24:20.577 --> 24:24.599
<i>*Alone again, naturally.*</i>

24:26.262 --> 24:28.535
<i>*To think that only yesterday.*</i>

24:29.117 --> 24:31.263
<i>*I was cheerful bright and gay.*</i>

24:31.491 --> 24:35.711
<i>*Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do,
the role I was about...*</i>

24:35.713 --> 24:42.092
I know, I know.
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

24:42.102 --> 24:45.579
I understand you,
little well dressed bird.

24:45.588 --> 24:53.065
Purposeless, emptiness, it's a vacuum isn't
it. What's your vacuum like?

24:53.066 --> 24:57.365
<i>*Going off the rails, on a crazy train, sir.*</i>

24:57.366 --> 24:59.830
Hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.

25:01.508 --> 25:07.062
I'm in a heated existential discussion
with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.

25:10.085 --> 25:12.642
I...is something wrong, sir?

25:13.490 --> 25:15.617
Just think about it.

25:15.618 --> 25:17.475
We have it all.

25:18.886 --> 25:20.913
But we have nothing.

25:22.076 --> 25:24.404
It's just to easy now.

25:25.205 --> 25:27.409
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.

25:28.143 --> 25:33.522
-I mean, we did it, right?
-Well, you did it, sir.

25:33.530 --> 25:35.885
Yes you've made that perfectly clear.

25:35.890 --> 25:40.884
-Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly?
-Huh?

25:40.892 --> 25:43.298
Unhappy.

25:43.299 --> 25:50.613
Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow,
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

25:50.625 --> 25:52.409
That always seems to lift your spirits.

25:54.843 --> 25:59.031
Good idea, Minion. But without him,
what's the point?

25:59.569 --> 26:02.161
-Him, sir?
-Nothing.

26:03.036 --> 26:06.204
Okay, um, all right well just uh, that’s uh,

26:06.209 --> 26:07.974
something to consider and um,

26:07.983 --> 26:11.132
well, I think I'll just power
down for a while then.

26:18.179 --> 26:20.065
He was always there for us.

26:20.376 --> 26:22.225
Dependable.

26:24.092 --> 26:25.547
Perhaps we took him for granted.

26:25.548 --> 26:29.995
Maybe we never really know how good we
have it, until it's gone.

26:31.639 --> 26:33.238
We miss you, Metro Man.

26:33.241 --> 26:35.406
I, miss you.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.876
And I have just one question for,
Megamind.

26:38.884 --> 26:40.826
Are you happy now?

26:43.852 --> 26:47.116
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a
city without a hero.

26:47.159 --> 26:52.849
Coming up next. Are you ready to be a
slave army? What you need to know.

26:58.521 --> 27:03.310
Aaannd wrap that up and give it
to a child on Christmas.

27:03.317 --> 27:06.420
-'Cause we're done.
-Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal.

27:06.425 --> 27:09.782
Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party
at my house.

27:09.783 --> 27:11.951
Coming off the hook, or whatever.
You should come over.

27:11.954 --> 27:15.984
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.
Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick.

27:15.992 --> 27:20.338
Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really
fell like being around a bunch of people.

27:20.346 --> 27:22.488
No, no, no. That's the best part,
it'll  be like just you and me.

27:24.404 --> 27:28.158
Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting.

27:28.265 --> 27:30.078
-But,
-I did hire a wedding photographer.

27:30.081 --> 27:32.992
That's just in case, we were like
something crazy happened.

27:32.998 --> 27:35.842
And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe
we should have this for like ever,

27:35.847 --> 27:37.297
like a memory, you know.

27:37.299 --> 27:39.269
Um, I'm gonna pass.

27:39.270 --> 27:42.395
I have some work here I need
to do. Okay, bye.

27:42.401 --> 27:44.669
So Thursday? Soft, Thursday?

27:44.676 --> 27:46.839
-Goodnight, Hal.
-It's a soft yes, on Thursday.

27:48.730 --> 27:50.210
What's, wrong with me?

27:50.212 --> 27:54.679
Rented a bouncy house? Chick's don't like
bouncy houses, they like clown's.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.604
OW! Ohhh!

27:57.318 --> 28:00.816
Stupid van!
Broke my finger!

28:36.910 --> 28:38.861
I've made a horrible mistake.

28:39.532 --> 28:41.616
I didn't mean to destroy you.

28:41.617 --> 28:44.310
I mean, I meant to destroy you.

28:44.717 --> 28:46.681
I didn't think it would really work.

28:47.425 --> 28:53.608
What are we suppose to do? Without you,
evil is running rampant through the streets.

28:53.609 --> 28:57.213
I am so tired of running rampant
through the streets.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.702
What's the point of being bad when
there's no good to try and stop you?

29:02.650 --> 29:04.249
Someone has to stop, Megamind.

29:04.250 --> 29:05.530
Hey, we're closing soon.

29:05.533 --> 29:06.739
Oh, you scared me.

29:06.741 --> 29:08.543
-Barry, right?
-Bernard.

29:08.546 --> 29:12.951
Bernard, I was just well I was
talking to myself.

29:12.958 --> 29:14.705
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.

29:14.710 --> 29:16.940
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.

29:16.941 --> 29:17.781
Thank you, I just...

29:17.783 --> 29:19.533
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

29:21.251 --> 29:23.118
-Okay.
-Thanks.

29:23.236 --> 29:26.826
I had so many evil plans in the works.

29:27.186 --> 29:28.825
The illiteracy beam.

29:28.829 --> 29:31.004
Typhoon cheese.

29:31.007 --> 29:32.654
Robo sheep.

29:33.367 --> 29:35.695
Battles we will now, never have.

29:38.892 --> 29:41.215
You know we never had the chance
to say goodbye.

29:41.632 --> 29:44.577
So, it's good that we have this time now.

29:44.682 --> 29:47.235
You know, before I destroy the place.

29:47.241 --> 29:50.647
Nothing personal, it just brings back
to many painful memories.

29:54.832 --> 29:56.704
Hello, hello?

29:56.708 --> 29:57.739
Roxanne!

30:06.944 --> 30:09.504
That's a pretty tasteless costume.

30:09.505 --> 30:14.227
-Costume?
-Megamind's head is not that grossly exaggerated.

30:14.235 --> 30:19.017
Oh you even made a cheap replica of
his dehydration gun. How...

30:20.227 --> 30:21.948
Hello, is someone there?

30:24.750 --> 30:27.008
Hello, who's there?

30:27.609 --> 30:30.079
Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.199
It's just you, Bernard.

30:31.202 --> 30:33.952
Oh, yes it's just me.
Bernard.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.600
Well thank you for letting me stay.

30:36.601 --> 30:39.551
Look I wouldn't stay for more than two minutes
and thirty seven seconds if I were you.

30:39.555 --> 30:42.302
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.

30:42.302 --> 30:44.604
Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation.

30:44.605 --> 30:47.593
I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down
with you then.

30:54.232 --> 30:57.511
I kept thinking he was going to do
one of his last minute escapes.

30:58.426 --> 31:01.364
Yeah, he was really good at those.

31:01.394 --> 31:04.127
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.

31:04.642 --> 31:06.988
I've looked into the reset button.

31:08.038 --> 31:09.907
The size is impossible.

31:10.243 --> 31:15.657
Oh, Bernard, I didn't know you had...feelings.
Are you okay?

31:16.822 --> 31:21.561
Metro Man is gone. And now there's
no one left to challenge Megamind.

31:21.568 --> 31:23.280
Oh, come on, Bernard.

31:23.281 --> 31:26.009
As long as there's evil good will
rise up against it.

31:26.015 --> 31:27.922
Ohhh, I wish.

31:27.923 --> 31:30.996
I believe someone is going to stand
up to Megamind.

31:30.997 --> 31:32.034
-You really think so?
-Yeah.

31:32.035 --> 31:35.904
I mean, it's like they say.
Heroes aren't born, they're made.

31:38.345 --> 31:41.777
Heroes can be made. That's it!

31:42.305 --> 31:44.967
-All you need are the right ingredients.
-Yeah.

31:44.972 --> 31:46.610
-Bravery.
-Yes.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.910
-Strength.
-Of course.

31:47.912 --> 31:49.718
-Determination.
-Imperative.

31:49.722 --> 31:51.677
And a smidgen of DNA.

31:51.686 --> 31:55.095
-With that, anyone can be a hero.
-Yeah!

31:55.096 --> 31:56.761
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

31:57.092 --> 31:58.305
I think we should run.

31:59.037 --> 32:00.040
Bye.

32:01.226 --> 32:03.384
Time to put the past behind us.

32:04.783 --> 32:06.763
Only the future...AHH!

32:06.766 --> 32:10.082
Oh, I'm to close.
I'm genuinely scared right now.

32:10.163 --> 32:12.517
Oh, I hope no ones seeing this.

32:12.584 --> 32:16.374
Create a hero? Wait, wait, what?
Why would you do that?

32:16.381 --> 32:18.087
So I have someone to fight.

32:18.090 --> 32:20.831
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

32:20.838 --> 32:22.862
A ying, with no yang.

32:22.865 --> 32:25.276
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.

32:25.281 --> 32:27.924
In other words, I have no purpose.

32:27.928 --> 32:30.625
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.

32:30.626 --> 32:31.774
Go on, ask.

32:31.778 --> 32:33.277
How are you doing to do it?

32:35.228 --> 32:37.773
I'm going to give someone, I don't know
who yet.

32:37.777 --> 32:43.398
Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that
someone to become Montrocity's new hero.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.126
Over here, follow.

32:45.129 --> 32:50.353
And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero.
In an epic battle of good and evil.

32:50.361 --> 32:53.283
We could put everything back the way it was.

32:53.288 --> 32:55.733
When the world was perfect.

32:55.755 --> 32:58.168
And rosy. Behold, Minion.

32:58.186 --> 33:00.289
Metro Man's cape.

33:00.290 --> 33:01.302
Look closely.

33:01.311 --> 33:02.949
Tell me what you see?

33:02.952 --> 33:03.964
Dandruff?

33:04.137 --> 33:06.699
Yes, it's his DNA.

33:06.708 --> 33:11.646
From this, we'll extract the source of
Metro Man's awesome power.

33:14.219 --> 33:16.624
Sir, I think this is a bad idea.

33:16.629 --> 33:21.791
Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea.
For the greater good of man.

33:21.799 --> 33:24.463
But I'm saying this is a kind of
bad, bad.

33:24.467 --> 33:27.395
Okay, you might think it's good
in your bad perception.

33:27.396 --> 33:30.844
But from a good perception,
it is just plain bad.

33:30.855 --> 33:33.186
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.

33:34.126 --> 33:36.651
Now we have just one shot at this.

33:36.659 --> 33:38.893
We must find a suitable subject.

33:38.899 --> 33:45.819
Someone who will do harm to mine.
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.

33:46.311 --> 33:49.916
What on earth is that?

33:49.936 --> 33:53.082
Seems to be emanating from there, sir.

33:55.873 --> 33:58.478
-O-llo,
-Uh, it's hello.

33:58.483 --> 34:00.176
Hello, like that?

34:00.179 --> 34:02.485
-Bernard, it's Roxanne.
-It's Roxanne.

34:02.490 --> 34:04.897
I just want to thank you for
inspiring me the other day.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.235
-Oh, You've inspired me too.
-Great!

34:07.236 --> 34:11.054
It's time we stood up to Megamind
and show him he can't push us around.

34:11.061 --> 34:13.677
Oh, oh really.
She's so cute.

34:13.681 --> 34:15.649
-I'm already hot on his trail.
-Uh, huh.

34:15.652 --> 34:17.827
And what gives you that idea?

34:17.831 --> 34:20.254
-Uh, sir.
-I just found his secret hideout.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.770
How did she find my hideout?

34:21.773 --> 34:24.998
Uh, how did you find his hideout?

34:25.004 --> 34:29.663
This is the only building in Metro City
with a big observatory on the roof.

34:32.139 --> 34:35.302
Okay, there's no way she'll find
the secret entrance.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.940
Oh! There's a doormat here that
say's 'Secret Entrance'.

34:39.868 --> 34:42.012
-Minion!
-I kept forgetting where it was.

34:42.016 --> 34:43.617
She'll discover all our secrets.

34:43.621 --> 34:46.811
-Ohh, oh no!
-You dim-witted creation of science.

34:46.815 --> 34:48.802
-What?
-Oh, not you Roxanne.

34:48.806 --> 34:51.138
No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn.

34:51.143 --> 34:52.909
Don't do anything, I'll be right there.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.913
Roxanne?

34:54.940 --> 34:57.085
Oh no, not again.

35:03.298 --> 35:04.670
Roxanne.

35:04.673 --> 35:07.050
-Whoa!
-Oh, I'm glad you're here.

35:07.053 --> 35:08.762
Wait, how did you get here so fast?

35:08.769 --> 35:12.809
Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking
nearby when you called.

35:12.816 --> 35:14.061
-In a suit?
-Uh huh.

35:14.064 --> 35:16.392
It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'.

35:16.397 --> 35:17.892
But that's not important.

35:17.894 --> 35:19.015
I better take the lead.

35:19.018 --> 35:20.157
This way looks exciting.

35:20.159 --> 35:20.930
No, it says, exit.

35:20.931 --> 35:24.202
Uh, which is the abbreviation
for 'Exciting', right?

35:24.203 --> 35:26.705
It's the mother load.

35:26.706 --> 35:28.031
-Ahh.
-Wow.

35:28.032 --> 35:29.703
-Wow.
-Just look at this thing.

35:29.704 --> 35:32.379
You know, I really could use your help in
deciphering all this.

35:32.380 --> 35:35.503
-Really?
-You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?

35:35.504 --> 35:39.991
-Yes, right.
-Together we could figure out his plan
for the city and stop it.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.048
Are you in?

35:42.051 --> 35:44.376
-Oh, what fun!
-That's what I want to hear.

35:44.452 --> 35:46.488
Minion,
Code-Send in the brain bots.

35:46.489 --> 35:48.922
You know the whole point of a code is...

35:48.923 --> 35:50.946
Oh code-just do it, Minion.

35:54.182 --> 35:56.170
Ahh, it's me you fools!

35:56.171 --> 35:57.281
Bernard!

35:59.004 --> 36:00.290
It's daddy.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.708
Megamind!

36:04.977 --> 36:05.842
What have you done with, Bernard?

36:05.843 --> 36:10.104
Oh Bernard? Oh yes, I'm doing
horrible things to that man.

36:10.111 --> 36:12.377
I don't want to get into it but,
Lasers, spikes.

36:12.378 --> 36:15.395
Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes!

36:15.396 --> 36:16.924
You know the drill.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.745
Oh no, not the drill.

36:19.746 --> 36:21.602
-Let him go.
-Or what?

36:21.607 --> 36:24.293
Or I'm going to find out what this
weird looking gun does.

36:24.298 --> 36:26.890
No don't!
Don't shoot that gun.

36:26.895 --> 36:28.510
I'll just go get him.

36:28.555 --> 36:30.461
Unhand me you fiend!

36:30.566 --> 36:33.278
It, its strength's to much.

36:33.286 --> 36:35.480
Oh, I work out.

36:35.484 --> 36:40.564
Argh, it's really paying off.
You're so fit, and strangely charismatic.

36:44.145 --> 36:45.179
Are you okay?

36:45.180 --> 36:48.021
I've did my best.
But he's to fantastic.

36:48.616 --> 36:50.461
Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.

36:50.462 --> 36:51.528
I got this covered.

36:54.699 --> 36:55.827
Let go, it's mine!

36:55.827 --> 36:57.277
Bernard, run!

36:59.994 --> 37:00.996
Give it to me.

37:01.328 --> 37:02.331
Oh no!

37:08.042 --> 37:09.030
Roxanne.

37:10.771 --> 37:11.773
Ow!

37:15.329 --> 37:16.590
Who on earth is that?

37:26.780 --> 37:27.783
Roxanne!

37:29.135 --> 37:32.006
Bernard, you were right about that door
being exciting.

37:32.546 --> 37:33.550
This way.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.413
-Aha!
-What are you doing?

37:40.414 --> 37:42.250
This will stop them, here!

37:42.251 --> 37:44.244
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it.

37:45.957 --> 37:47.152
Just throw it.

37:47.153 --> 37:48.936
Daddy's, sorry.

37:59.719 --> 38:02.643
-Wow, that was real exciting.
-Yeah.

38:02.644 --> 38:04.350
-You were very strong in there.
-I know.

38:04.351 --> 38:07.284
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man
stand up to him like that.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.444
What's going on?

38:08.624 --> 38:09.710
Hal, what happened?

38:09.711 --> 38:11.121
I think a bee flew up my nose.

38:11.319 --> 38:14.323
I was just about to make my frontal
assault to rescue you,

38:14.324 --> 38:16.311
but like fifty ninjas started to attack me.

38:16.312 --> 38:19.270
So I had to beat them all up, and I did...

38:19.271 --> 38:20.579
-and they were all like crying, and stuff.
-Wow.

38:20.580 --> 38:22.272
Brave one, isn't he.

38:22.276 --> 38:23.425
Who are you?

38:23.427 --> 38:25.124
Oh thi..., this is Bernard.

38:25.125 --> 38:26.734
-He's my partner.
-Partner?

38:27.275 --> 38:28.599
Yes, yes partner.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.064
Well look partner, I'm her partner.

38:31.065 --> 38:34.371
She doesn't know what she's saying. She's
been through a traumatic experience.

38:34.372 --> 38:36.504
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.962
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

38:46.642 --> 38:47.944
Yeah, okay.

38:48.186 --> 38:48.959
I'd like that.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.256
That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you
accidentally, hugged him instead of me.

38:52.776 --> 38:53.556
Sir!

38:53.897 --> 38:54.897
SIR!

38:54.987 --> 38:57.395
Code-Did you find out
who it was?

38:57.398 --> 38:59.642
Huh?
Oh, oh.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.172
Code-get the car.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.663
Code-right away, sir.

39:12.090 --> 39:13.864
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow, Hal.

39:13.865 --> 39:16.267
I'll leave the door unlocked in case
you want to check on me later.

39:18.154 --> 39:22.590
Who is this man,
we've infused with godlike power?

39:22.808 --> 39:26.034
Ow, ow, whoa ho.

39:26.035 --> 39:28.957
Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's twenty eight years old.

39:28.958 --> 39:30.627
No criminal record.

39:30.628 --> 39:31.963
Actually, no records at all.

39:31.964 --> 39:34.312
Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything.

39:34.909 --> 39:36.862
Not yet, Minion.
Not...

39:37.713 --> 39:38.729
...Yet.

39:38.730 --> 39:41.506
Could this day get anymore, funtastic?

39:41.513 --> 39:43.633
So I will just go ahead and defuse him,

39:43.637 --> 39:47.053
since this is clearly a mistake.

39:47.059 --> 39:49.773
No, Minion. Something much
more powerful at work.

39:49.810 --> 39:51.821
This is no mistake.

39:51.829 --> 39:53.545
It's destiny.

39:55.350 --> 39:58.984
Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny.

39:58.985 --> 40:02.678
Hal? Hal Stewart?

40:02.682 --> 40:03.694
Am I saying it right?

40:03.695 --> 40:05.006
-Stewart.
-Aaah.

40:06.016 --> 40:09.574
Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across
the hall has way better stuff than me.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.716
Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart.

40:11.718 --> 40:12.780
Quick, the spray.

40:14.005 --> 40:17.069
-Oops, all out.
-Well use the forget-me-stick.

40:17.070 --> 40:18.085
Oh, right!

40:20.761 --> 40:21.764
Just look at him.

40:23.174 --> 40:26.830
Well, he doesn't look quite the
hero type to me.

40:26.831 --> 40:28.212
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.877
The power couldn't ask for a finer claim.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.402
I smell hero.

40:34.403 --> 40:36.758
I smell something burning.

40:36.760 --> 40:37.727
I think it's working!

40:37.728 --> 40:40.862
Places, places,
places, places...

40:41.603 --> 40:42.867
You have your disguise?

40:49.327 --> 40:50.527
What?

40:50.528 --> 40:52.546
Ah, you look fantastic.

41:02.559 --> 41:05.033
Rise, my glorious creation.

41:05.035 --> 41:07.754
Rise, and come to Papa.

41:08.337 --> 41:09.323
What's going on?

41:09.468 --> 41:12.125
-Easy my child.
-Who are you?

41:12.126 --> 41:15.494
I sent  you to this planet to
teach  you about justice.

41:15.495 --> 41:17.859
Honor, and nobility.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.171
I am your father.

41:20.668 --> 41:23.215
So you're like, my space Dad?

41:23.784 --> 41:26.570
Yeah, I'm like your space Dad.

41:27.186 --> 41:29.309
And you are, what?

41:29.313 --> 41:32.492
I'm your space, Step-Mom.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.382
I, I had some work done recently.

41:35.389 --> 41:37.337
Is this some kind of dream?

41:37.342 --> 41:39.516
This is a dream come true.

41:39.517 --> 41:42.909
You've been blethed
with unfathomamble power.

41:42.910 --> 41:43.985
What kind of power?

41:43.987 --> 41:45.154
Unfathamomble.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.731
It's un, without Fathom.

41:47.740 --> 41:51.267
-Whoa
-Yeah, we've come to guide you.

41:51.273 --> 41:54.764
On your path to be Montrosity's new hero.

41:54.779 --> 41:58.952
And battle the super genius, of Megamind.

42:02.197 --> 42:04.318
I know this is a lot to take in.

42:04.319 --> 42:06.858
It may take months for you
to come to grips..

42:06.859 --> 42:08.096
No frickin' way.

42:08.622 --> 42:09.828
I wasn't finished.

42:12.335 --> 42:15.522
Wahoo! I'm going to be a hero.

42:15.633 --> 42:18.578
I'm going to be a hero.

42:18.579 --> 42:23.000
Thee Minion, he's perfect.

42:23.001 --> 42:25.420
Aaannd, action!

42:25.422 --> 42:27.833
Someone help me.
-I'm okay.

42:27.834 --> 42:30.812
<i>*Sun is shinning in the sky*</i>

42:30.812 --> 42:32.477
Ohhh, oh!

42:32.478 --> 42:34.337
<i>*There ain't a cloud in sight*</i>

42:35.215 --> 42:36.979
Zap, zap, zap.

42:37.794 --> 42:39.493
Ha, haaa!

42:40.186 --> 42:44.905
The flames of my evil burn bright.
Now you thay thomething cool back at me.

42:44.906 --> 42:47.673
Look, it doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.

42:47.674 --> 42:51.345
No, no, no. Slow it down, and stop.

42:51.347 --> 42:52.886
I said slow down.

42:53.038 --> 42:54.264
Watch out.

42:58.270 --> 43:00.840
He's hopeless. HOPELESS!

43:00.921 --> 43:03.548
-Maybe we should change tactics?
-You think so?

43:03.612 --> 43:06.925
Oh, you know how boys are.
They love video games.

43:06.930 --> 43:09.099
I can throw a few parts together.

43:09.104 --> 43:12.711
Can't...wait.
LoL,  smiley face.

43:12.717 --> 43:14.220
Can't wait for what, sir?

43:15.147 --> 43:17.351
Oh, that was such a funny story.

43:17.360 --> 43:20.168
And brilliantly told, by the way.

43:20.170 --> 43:22.192
Okay, now you tell one.

43:22.197 --> 43:24.503
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.

43:24.511 --> 43:27.201
And, I never heard you laugh before.

43:27.207 --> 43:28.738
Yeah, it's been a while.

43:29.442 --> 43:30.658
Feels pretty good.

43:31.759 --> 43:34.575
<i>*Mr. Blue, you did it right.*</i>

43:35.591 --> 43:37.201
And, exit.

43:40.419 --> 43:42.425
<i>*Now his hand is on your shoulder*</i>

43:42.434 --> 43:43.758
<i>*Never mind*</i>

43:43.759 --> 43:45.858
<i>*I'll remember you this, *</i>

43:46.439 --> 43:49.237
<i>*I'll remember you this way.*</i>

43:49.238 --> 43:50.501
You  don't get out much, do you?

43:50.502 --> 43:52.279
Fun!

43:53.573 --> 43:55.854
I used to come here with my mother
when I was a kid.

43:56.578 --> 43:58.556
It was one of my favorite things to do.

43:59.395 --> 44:00.651
Now look at it.

44:00.652 --> 44:01.807
It's a dump.

44:01.808 --> 44:05.048
<i>*Hey Mr. Blue,
we're so please to be with you.*</i>

44:06.715 --> 44:08.507
Why are we cleaning up the City, sir?

44:08.508 --> 44:13.577
Um, well we don't want to battle our
new hero in a dump, now...do we?

44:17.565 --> 44:19.104
They're all back.

44:19.110 --> 44:20.707
But how, why?

44:20.710 --> 44:23.150
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

44:28.675 --> 44:32.828
That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove.

44:32.830 --> 44:35.074
Wa haoooo

44:37.564 --> 44:42.603
Okay, okay, Metro Man and I,
were never a couple.

44:42.605 --> 44:43.986
But I thought you two were...

44:43.988 --> 44:47.385
I know, everybody did. It's just,
well he was never really my type.

44:47.392 --> 44:48.638
Really?

44:48.755 --> 44:51.228
Okay, now you tell me something.

44:51.232 --> 44:54.094
Something you've never told anyone.

44:54.847 --> 44:58.729
Well, in shh-school.

44:59.581 --> 45:02.304
None of the other kids really liked me.

45:03.544 --> 45:05.823
I was always last one picked
for everything.

45:07.079 --> 45:10.036
Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't
go to the same school.

45:15.258 --> 45:18.466
Hal, I think  you're ready for this.

45:20.587 --> 45:22.408
Do I have a son?

45:22.409 --> 45:25.154
No, Hal, you make me laugh.

45:25.159 --> 45:27.316
It stretches, it's for you.

45:28.683 --> 45:30.501
Hey, what's the 'T' stand for?

45:30.504 --> 45:31.667
Titan.

45:31.672 --> 45:34.210
Tighten? What's that suppose to mean?

45:34.222 --> 45:36.718
It was the only name I
could trademark.

45:37.776 --> 45:38.858
Oh.

45:38.859 --> 45:41.790
Do you have someone special
in your life, Hal?

45:41.845 --> 45:44.072
No not yet, but.

45:44.076 --> 45:48.676
There's this really, really good looking one
I've got my eye on, currently.

45:52.540 --> 45:57.143
That's very good. Romance is
very inspiring.

45:57.169 --> 46:01.315
-That's what I hear.
-All you have to do, is save her.

46:01.323 --> 46:03.149
And she'll be yours.

46:03.152 --> 46:04.972
-Who want's Churro's?
-I do!

46:06.782 --> 46:08.659
Thanks spaced out, momma.

46:08.668 --> 46:11.086
On the count of three,
unsheathe your Churro.

46:11.090 --> 46:14.046
One, two, three!
To Titan.

46:14.061 --> 46:16.967
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind.

46:16.968 --> 46:19.559
And the city will know your name.

46:21.558 --> 46:24.162
The City's parks' restored to their
original glory.

46:24.166 --> 46:26.420
The street's, the safest they've been.

46:26.422 --> 46:27.830
The banks reopened.

46:27.834 --> 46:30.088
Has something happened to Megamind?

46:30.092 --> 46:32.811
Has someone tamed this monster?

46:32.813 --> 46:38.376
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic,
and pleasantly confused.

46:38.422 --> 46:41.073
Well you seem in a very good
mood tonight, sir.

46:41.074 --> 46:44.420
Huh? Oh yes, how long is this going to take?

46:44.573 --> 46:49.141
Just a few alterations, sir. And I will be
done with your most terrifying cape yet.

46:49.254 --> 46:54.061
I'm calling it, The Black
Mambaaaaaaa...aaaa...aaa.

46:54.063 --> 46:59.864
Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am
running late. I have to go.

46:59.865 --> 47:01.719
What, where, where are  you going, sir?

47:01.720 --> 47:04.468
We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning.

47:04.469 --> 47:06.793
We haven't even tested your
big battle suit yet.

47:06.794 --> 47:08.262
You attend to the details, Minion.

47:08.263 --> 47:10.573
I have to, run a quick errand.

47:10.574 --> 47:12.290
You don't run errands.

47:12.596 --> 47:13.752
What's going on here?

47:13.753 --> 47:15.938
-What?
-Oh, wait a minute.

47:16.784 --> 47:20.803
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,
For Him?

47:20.805 --> 47:22.052
It's just my natural musk.

47:22.053 --> 47:24.006
Now, where are the car keys?

47:24.007 --> 47:25.100
Ahhh.

47:25.356 --> 47:28.591
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it.

47:28.596 --> 47:30.356
Your going on a date with her.

47:30.359 --> 47:35.066
No my main man, get out of town.

47:35.075 --> 47:38.550
Oh this is bad, this is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.

47:38.556 --> 47:40.960
You are forgetting your place, Minion.

47:40.964 --> 47:42.595
Now give me the keys.

47:43.695 --> 47:47.406
What happens when Roxanne finds
out who you really are?

47:47.413 --> 47:49.187
She will never find out.

47:49.191 --> 47:51.246
That's the point of lying.

47:51.247 --> 47:53.172
Ahhh!

47:53.173 --> 47:57.135
Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think
this was your first day of being evil.

47:57.142 --> 47:58.393
NO!

47:59.361 --> 48:01.480
This has gone far enough.

48:02.564 --> 48:05.008
Oh, that was really grown up.

48:07.195 --> 48:09.351
Sir please, it's for your own good.

48:09.533 --> 48:10.887
Well what do you know.

48:10.890 --> 48:13.073
I may not know much, but I do know this.

48:13.079 --> 48:16.238
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

48:16.243 --> 48:19.008
Maybe I don't want to be the bad
guy anymore.

48:22.540 --> 48:24.070
You heard me.

48:24.071 --> 48:25.903
Who are you?

48:26.496 --> 48:29.483
-Now give me the keys.
-NO!

48:29.784 --> 48:32.776
My soul purpose in life is
to look after you.

48:32.782 --> 48:34.796
Well I don't need you to look after me.

48:34.799 --> 48:37.031
What are you...what are you saying?

48:37.034 --> 48:39.852
-You don't need me?
-Let me make it clear.

48:39.858 --> 48:42.186
Code-I don't need you.

48:42.191 --> 48:43.998
You know what, you know what.

48:46.725 --> 48:49.548
Code-I'll just pack my thing and go.

48:49.549 --> 48:50.710
Code-Fine!

48:50.711 --> 48:52.333
Code-Fine back.

48:55.497 --> 48:57.538
Well good luck on your date.

48:57.539 --> 49:00.386
-I will.
-That doesn't even make any sense.

49:00.387 --> 49:01.336
I know.

49:32.455 --> 49:35.844
I know I am so close, I can feel it.

49:38.272 --> 49:42.113
Okay, okay I just have to take
a step back.

49:48.077 --> 49:49.362
Wait a minute.

50:01.658 --> 50:03.592
Titan.

50:03.593 --> 50:05.494
What's a Titan?

50:05.495 --> 50:08.708
My super ears are burning.

50:10.113 --> 50:13.238
I usually just hear criminals. You
haven't been naughty, have you?

50:13.971 --> 50:16.453
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing
with you.

50:16.454 --> 50:17.576
The names Titan.

50:18.478 --> 50:21.986
-Titan?
-Your very own heroic  guardian
of pure awesome.

50:21.987 --> 50:24.086
What's your name? Just kidding, I know
everything about you.

50:24.087 --> 50:27.244
Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers,

50:27.246 --> 50:30.719
Didn't know what you liked, so I
just grabbed  you know, all of them.

50:32.554 --> 50:35.486
Okay, you don't like flowers.
Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers.

50:35.487 --> 50:38.781
-What do you want?
-Thought maybe we could go for a little
flight around town.

50:38.782 --> 50:40.511
-Get to know each other first.
-WHOA!

50:41.558 --> 50:43.402
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.

50:43.403 --> 50:44.598
Just what do you think you're doing?

50:44.599 --> 50:45.767
Oh are I moving to fast?

50:45.768 --> 50:49.953
You're probably right. I should just
rescue you a few times before we get
all romantic.

50:49.954 --> 50:51.263
Whoops!

50:51.629 --> 50:55.315
Saved you. You are lucky to
have such a great hero here.

50:55.317 --> 50:57.861
Oh no. Somebody do something?

50:57.862 --> 51:00.338
Oh, right, right. Duh! I gotcha.

51:06.374 --> 51:09.762
That was fun, you almost died.
But I saved you.

51:09.763 --> 51:11.315
-Aaaah, building!
-AH!

51:15.701 --> 51:16.803
Gotcha!

51:16.804 --> 51:19.420
Whoo, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

51:19.421 --> 51:21.775
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of me saving your life.

51:21.777 --> 51:23.403
Put me down, right now!

51:23.404 --> 51:25.942
Okay, all right, all right,
hold on.

51:28.568 --> 51:29.898
Are you crazy?

51:29.900 --> 51:33.584
I suppose I'm, a little crazy...
about you.

51:33.585 --> 51:35.254
Who are you? Really.

51:35.267 --> 51:40.262
Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare
to have your mind blown, little lady.

51:41.428 --> 51:43.622
-Tada!
-Hal?

51:43.623 --> 51:45.991
Yeah, isn't this great?

51:45.992 --> 51:48.162
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

51:48.164 --> 51:50.077
No, it's not great.

51:50.078 --> 51:54.451
Wow, our first fight. This is so us,
we're like an old married couple.

51:54.452 --> 51:57.604
There is no us, okay. There will
never be an us.

51:57.605 --> 52:00.078
But, I have powers.

52:00.079 --> 52:02.869
I have a cape, I'm the good guy.

52:02.870 --> 52:03.640
You are a good guy, Hal.

52:03.641 --> 52:06.933
But you don't understand we need to
find out why...

52:06.934 --> 52:08.917
-Right now,
-This isn't right.

52:08.922 --> 52:11.200
-Listen to me, Hal.
-You're suppose to be with me.

52:11.201 --> 52:13.337
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

52:13.338 --> 52:17.178
It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal.

52:40.156 --> 52:42.165
-Bernard.
-Roxanne.

52:42.170 --> 52:45.842
-Sorry I'm late.
-Wow, your hair looks exciting.

52:45.848 --> 52:48.995
Hmm, not the only exciting development
of the night.

52:49.010 --> 52:51.456
Megamind's created a new hero.

52:51.457 --> 52:52.790
And I know why.

52:53.841 --> 52:55.387
It all makes sense now.

52:55.391 --> 52:59.947
He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created
a new hero to kick it for him.

53:00.298 --> 53:02.705
But why did he pick, Hal?

53:02.708 --> 53:05.839
Hal is the worst possible person
you could pick.

53:05.846 --> 53:08.198
Wow, that's a lot to take in.

53:08.203 --> 53:10.030
It, it boggles my mind.

53:10.034 --> 53:12.036
I am extremely boggled.

53:12.040 --> 53:15.394
You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom
of who's kicking who's butt.

53:15.399 --> 53:16.402
But in the mean time.

53:17.316 --> 53:19.722
Let's enjoy each other's company.

53:19.727 --> 53:22.965
I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right,

53:22.969 --> 53:25.904
you know, I could use a breather.

53:25.914 --> 53:31.704
To, Bernard. For being the only normal
thing in my crazy upside down world.

53:31.714 --> 53:35.011
To...being normal.

53:45.312 --> 53:47.403
-Roxanne.
-Yes?

53:48.564 --> 53:50.604
Say I wasn't so normal.

53:51.283 --> 53:57.390
Say I was bald and had the complexion
of a popular primary color.

53:57.418 --> 54:00.426
As a random, non specific example.

54:01.195 --> 54:03.054
Would you still enjoy my company?

54:03.055 --> 54:05.890
Of course, you don't judge a book by
its cover.

54:05.895 --> 54:07.519
Or a person from the outside.

54:07.522 --> 54:09.426
Oh, that's a relief to hear.

54:09.430 --> 54:11.204
You judge them based on their actions.

54:11.913 --> 54:14.483
Well that seems kinda petty,
don't you think.

54:43.046 --> 54:45.883
-You.
-What, what?

54:46.447 --> 54:48.774
Oh, don't look at me!

54:48.778 --> 54:50.595
Just, just a technical glitch.

54:50.700 --> 54:51.966
Don't look yet.

54:52.295 --> 54:54.144
My bad.

54:57.336 --> 54:58.916
Where were we?

55:01.501 --> 55:03.248
Now, now, hold on.

55:03.252 --> 55:03.843
YOU!

55:24.041 --> 55:26.675
I can explain.

55:28.461 --> 55:30.446
What about everything you just said?

55:30.449 --> 55:32.750
About judging a book by it's cover.

55:32.754 --> 55:36.098
Well let's take a look at the contents
then, shall we?

55:36.099 --> 55:37.533
You destroyed Metro Man.

55:37.537 --> 55:42.887
You took over the city and then you
actually got me to care about you.

55:44.051 --> 55:46.787
Why are you so evil?

55:46.788 --> 55:48.210
Tricking me?

55:48.212 --> 55:51.282
What could you possibly hope to gain?

55:56.362 --> 55:57.382
Wait a minute.

55:57.383 --> 56:00.181
Oh, I don't believe this.

56:03.527 --> 56:07.115
Do you really think that I would
ever be with you?

56:09.444 --> 56:10.568
no...

56:43.214 --> 56:46.334
Okay Minion, you were right.

56:46.344 --> 56:49.342
I was....less right.

56:49.647 --> 56:51.934
We should stick to what we're good at.

56:51.938 --> 56:53.827
Being bad.

56:55.125 --> 56:56.137
Minion...

57:15.571 --> 57:16.574
You there.

57:17.662 --> 57:18.666
Yeah, you.

57:19.786 --> 57:22.845
Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'!

57:55.129 --> 57:59.323
Okay, Titan it's time to go down,
in style.

58:21.748 --> 58:24.161
I hear there's a new hero.

58:24.162 --> 58:26.597
who dares to challenge my evil.

58:26.621 --> 58:29.847
Where is the one they call, Titan?

58:33.721 --> 58:36.098
Challenge me, if you dare.

58:58.918 --> 59:00.366
Oh no, we're gonna crash.

59:03.830 --> 59:06.435
This is embarrassing.

59:12.939 --> 59:15.123
Ballsy and incipient.

59:15.126 --> 59:18.920
Boneheaded, irresponsible.

59:19.191 --> 59:20.194
RUDE!

59:20.197 --> 59:22.775
Unprofessional, that's what this is.

59:22.783 --> 59:26.290
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

59:26.291 --> 59:28.369
Of course not, he was a pro.

59:28.374 --> 59:31.213
Hey, Megamind. You're actually
the guy I want to see.

59:31.219 --> 59:32.900
Also, there's a door here.

59:32.903 --> 59:37.144
Do you have any idea how long
I waited for you?

59:37.151 --> 59:38.675
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.

59:38.678 --> 59:41.380
Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying
to beat this level.

59:41.385 --> 59:43.594
Were you even planning on showing up?

59:43.598 --> 59:45.235
What's this?

59:47.452 --> 59:49.780
Where did you get all this stuff?

59:49.786 --> 59:51.612
It doesn't belong to me.

59:51.715 --> 59:53.097
You stole it!

59:53.099 --> 59:55.579
-Pretty cool, right.
-Oh no, no, no. You're a hero.

59:55.580 --> 59:57.181
Being a hero is for losers.

59:57.182 --> 59:59.971
It's work, work, work twenty four seven,
and for what?

59:59.976 --> 01:00:05.313
I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns
out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:06.979
Roxanne Ritchi?

01:00:06.982 --> 01:00:08.184
Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:12.666
I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes
at some intellectual dweeb.

01:00:12.673 --> 01:00:14.958
-Ohhhh
-Who needs all that noise.

01:00:14.962 --> 01:00:18.424
That's why I think, WE should
team up.

01:00:18.426 --> 01:00:20.074
You? Wait! What?

01:00:20.077 --> 01:00:22.550
With my power, and your big
headedness,

01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:24.376
we could rule the city.

01:00:24.377 --> 01:00:27.049
-You want to team up?
-I even drew up some new costume designs.

01:00:27.053 --> 01:00:28.389
-See
-Costume design?

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:32.070
You be the brain so you get a little brain
wearing glasses on your costume, or something.

01:00:32.076 --> 01:00:36.531
And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like
two tanks sword fighting.

01:00:36.919 --> 01:00:38.735
I can't believe you.

01:00:38.738 --> 01:00:46.124
All your gifts all your powers, and you
squander them for your own personal gain.

01:00:46.137 --> 01:00:47.756
-Yes!
-NO!

01:00:47.757 --> 01:00:52.829
I 'm the villain, you're the good guy.
I do something bad, and you come and get me.

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:54.757
That's why I created you.

01:00:54.761 --> 01:00:57.387
Yeah, right. You're nuts.

01:00:57.388 --> 01:01:00.932
-Space Dad told me.
-Look, I'm your Space Dad.

01:01:02.391 --> 01:01:04.700
You should be more like Metro Man.

01:01:05.906 --> 01:01:06.965
You tricked me?

01:01:06.968 --> 01:01:08.857
Oh, don't like that, huh?

01:01:08.861 --> 01:01:09.964
Well there's more.

01:01:11.497 --> 01:01:15.281
I'm also the intellectual dweeb
dating Roxanne.

01:01:15.704 --> 01:01:19.325
-No.
-And we were smooching up a storm.

01:01:19.326 --> 01:01:22.305
Mmmore...Mmmore...Mmmore.

01:01:22.306 --> 01:01:23.846
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna,...

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.969
YES! Yes I know.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:29.796
Bring me to justice. Oh god,
how I missed this.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.427
And the hero strikes the first blow.

01:01:35.431 --> 01:01:37.650
But evil returns with a backhand.

01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:43.451
YES!

01:01:48.688 --> 01:01:50.638
Ahh...shhhh.

01:01:52.232 --> 01:01:54.403
Come out you little freak!

01:01:54.404 --> 01:01:57.011
I want to see what that big brain
looks like on the pavement.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.606
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.

01:02:07.635 --> 01:02:09.101
You little blue, twerp.

01:02:11.674 --> 01:02:13.504
En Garde!

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.280
Oh, now that's the spirit.

01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:23.072
Take, that, parry again!

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:26.111
Now it's time for some witty back
and forth banter.

01:02:26.112 --> 01:02:28.626
You go first.

01:02:28.627 --> 01:02:31.182
Look, I'm not sure where to go with that.

01:02:32.639 --> 01:02:34.498
This one's for stealing my girlfriend.

01:02:40.334 --> 01:02:43.040
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.

01:02:50.632 --> 01:02:54.014
And Megamind! This one's for
Space, Step-Mom.

01:02:54.015 --> 01:02:55.574
You lied to her!

01:02:55.575 --> 01:02:59.613
Oh, well done, I thought that pummeling
went really, really well.

01:02:59.615 --> 01:03:01.493
I mean, I have a few notes.

01:03:01.494 --> 01:03:02.982
-Notes?
-But they can wait.

01:03:02.993 --> 01:03:04.446
You can take me to jail now.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.409
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking
more like the morgue.

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:08.924
-You're dead!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:08.925 --> 01:03:10.689
This isn't how you play the game.

01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:12.513
Game over.

01:03:18.813 --> 01:03:19.851
Brain Bots.

01:03:25.639 --> 01:03:27.145
I'm calling time out.

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:29.670
Time out, time out!

01:03:40.659 --> 01:03:43.495
Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe.

01:03:50.548 --> 01:03:52.861
Guess what, Buster Brown?

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:56.493
It's made from Copper. You're powerless
against it.

01:03:56.494 --> 01:03:59.082
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.936
Metro Man?

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:04.982
You, should stop comparing me
to Metro Man.

01:04:14.137 --> 01:04:16.932
You can run Megamind,
but you can't hide.

01:04:16.934 --> 01:04:18.840
We're saved, we're saved!

01:04:18.841 --> 01:04:20.919
What's your name, new hero?

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.522
-It's Tighten.
-Thank you, thank you.

01:04:23.523 --> 01:04:25.653
Tighten has freed us.

01:04:25.654 --> 01:04:27.581
Oh I wouldn't say free.

01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:30.839
More like, under new management.

01:04:34.963 --> 01:04:37.055
What do you want?

01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:41.294
-Titan's turned evil.
-Congratulations, another one of your genius
plans has backfired on you.

01:04:41.602 --> 01:04:43.836
And why did my doorman let you up?

01:04:44.344 --> 01:04:48.365
-Carlos?
-What are you, no, no!

01:04:48.366 --> 01:04:49.467
I need your help.

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:51.891
Why do you need MY help?

01:04:51.892 --> 01:04:55.905
Because you're the
smartest person I know.

01:04:57.594 --> 01:04:59.053
Well you can't hide here.

01:04:59.054 --> 01:05:01.096
Copper should  have worked,
why didn't the copper work?

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:03.140
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.

01:05:03.141 --> 01:05:04.930
Copper? You're not making any sense.

01:05:04.931 --> 01:05:08.687
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness.
He'll destroy the whole city.

01:05:11.124 --> 01:05:12.949
Okay, how can I help?

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.853
We need to find answers.
You knew Metro Man best.

01:05:15.859 --> 01:05:20.315
Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary
fortress of some kind?

01:05:20.322 --> 01:05:22.089
Anything that would give us clues.

01:05:22.507 --> 01:05:25.483
Well, there is one place I know.

01:05:27.267 --> 01:05:30.578
You gave him these powers, can't
you just take them away?

01:05:30.584 --> 01:05:35.269
I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I
misplaced the invisible car.

01:05:35.276 --> 01:05:37.059
The night you dumped me.

01:05:37.286 --> 01:05:39.184
Alone.

01:05:39.184 --> 01:05:41.099
In the rain.

01:05:41.793 --> 01:05:43.700
-Did you ever look back?
-NO!

01:05:43.701 --> 01:05:47.608
-Oh, my giant blue head.
-I guess we're here.

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:53.840
So, this is where he hid it.

01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:58.342
After all these years. My old shhool house.

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:03.784
You know, I think there's an
apology in order, for the other night.

01:06:03.788 --> 01:06:05.795
Okay that would be nice.
But make it quick.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.960
We have much more pressing
matters to deal with.

01:06:11.361 --> 01:06:16.445
Wow, can't believe he kept
all this stuff.

01:06:16.852 --> 01:06:19.647
Aww, I remember when he
wore that.

01:06:19.652 --> 01:06:21.014
Can we try to stay focused here?

01:06:21.015 --> 01:06:23.144
Yes of course, you're right, focused.

01:06:24.338 --> 01:06:26.507
HEY! Come over and look at this.

01:06:26.509 --> 01:06:28.598
What is it?
What did you find?

01:06:30.182 --> 01:06:32.888
Um.....look!

01:06:33.119 --> 01:06:36.025
This glass has ice cubes in it.

01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:37.632
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.

01:06:37.633 --> 01:06:39.751
No, what I'm saying is,

01:06:39.752 --> 01:06:44.124
don't you think it's a little odd that
the ice hasn't melted yet?

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:45.759
One of life's great mysteries.

01:06:51.985 --> 01:06:53.168
Hey.

01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:54.172
AAAAAAAAH!

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.050
We now have a confirmed report.

01:07:07.051 --> 01:07:11.053
Tighten, first thought to be the
City's new hero, has turned evil.

01:07:11.054 --> 01:07:13.975
The city has never seen this level
of destruction.

01:07:13.976 --> 01:07:16.433
If only Metro Man were still alive.

01:07:16.434 --> 01:07:18.119
-You're alive?
-You're alive.

01:07:19.144 --> 01:07:20.108
I'm alive.

01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:22.683
But..we..we
saw your skeleton.

01:07:22.688 --> 01:07:23.661
-You were dead.
-Are you a ghost?

01:07:23.662 --> 01:07:28.744
There had better be, an amazing
explanation for this.

01:07:29.356 --> 01:07:31.331
Speak, apparition.

01:07:40.867 --> 01:07:43.635
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:07:43.636 --> 01:07:45.069
You both deserve the truth.

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:47.619
It all started back at the observatory.

01:07:48.623 --> 01:07:51.661
Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna
stop you.

01:07:52.474 --> 01:07:54.550
My head wasn't in the game that day.

01:07:55.131 --> 01:07:58.379
We were kinda going through the motions.
So...

01:07:59.624 --> 01:08:01.120
Using my super speed.

01:08:01.121 --> 01:08:03.076
I decided to go clear my head.

01:08:04.351 --> 01:08:10.606
Then I realized we had done this same
silly charade our entire lives.

01:08:11.229 --> 01:08:13.833
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.402
But I just felt stuck.

01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:20.694
I began to realize, despite all my powers,

01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:24.229
each and every citizen of Metro had
something I didn't.

01:08:24.881 --> 01:08:26.073
A choice.

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:31.261
Ever since I can remember I've always
had to be what the City wanted me to be.

01:08:32.113 --> 01:08:34.157
But what about what I wanted to do?

01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:37.291
Then it suddenly hit me.

01:08:37.969 --> 01:08:39.734
I do have a choice.

01:08:40.568 --> 01:08:43.118
I can be whatever I want to be.

01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:46.091
No one said this hero thing had to
be a life time gig.

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:48.554
You can't just quit either.

01:08:49.363 --> 01:08:51.528
That's when I got the brilliant idea...

01:08:52.814 --> 01:08:54.219
...to fake my death.

01:08:54.701 --> 01:08:57.685
Copper drains my powers!

01:08:57.689 --> 01:09:00.385
-You're weakness is copper?

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:01.729
Once your death ray hit.

01:09:02.518 --> 01:09:04.979
I never felt so alive.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.032
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby
nursing school.

01:09:08.434 --> 01:09:11.354
Metro Man was finally dead.

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:13.122
And Music Man was born.

01:09:13.124 --> 01:09:14.255
Music man?

01:09:14.258 --> 01:09:15.716
That way I can keep my logo.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:16.720
-WHAT?
-'Cause of what?

01:09:16.724 --> 01:09:20.408
Finally I'm free, to get in touch
with my true power.

01:09:20.415 --> 01:09:22.595
Weaving lyrical magic.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.741
Check this out.

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:27.584
<i>*I have eyes that can see*</i>

01:09:27.585 --> 01:09:31.313
<i>*right through leaaadd.*</i>

01:09:31.314 --> 01:09:33.910
-That's horrible.
-Granted you have talent,

01:09:33.915 --> 01:09:37.622
But there's a mad man out there
destroying our...your city.

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:40.029
How could you do this?

01:09:40.474 --> 01:09:43.008
The people of the city relied on you,

01:09:43.009 --> 01:09:47.024
and you deserted them.
You left us in the hands of, him!

01:09:47.024 --> 01:09:48.124
No offense.

01:09:48.127 --> 01:09:49.286
No, I'm with you.

01:09:49.573 --> 01:09:51.670
Look, we need your help.

01:09:51.676 --> 01:09:54.528
I'm sorry, I really am.

01:09:54.529 --> 01:09:56.648
Um, I'm, I'm done.

01:09:56.649 --> 01:10:00.729
You know, little buddy. There's a Ying
for every Yang.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:04.066
If there's bad, good will rise up
against it.

01:10:04.704 --> 01:10:07.558
It's taken me a long time to
find my calling.

01:10:08.245 --> 01:10:11.195
Now it's about time, you find yours.

01:10:16.424 --> 01:10:18.163
Hey, who needs him.

01:10:18.167 --> 01:10:20.157
We can beat Tighten ourselves.

01:10:20.161 --> 01:10:23.029
I say we go back to the evil lair.
Grab some ray guns,

01:10:23.032 --> 01:10:25.859
hold them sideways, and just go
all gangsta on 'em.

01:10:26.675 --> 01:10:27.678
We can't

01:10:27.681 --> 01:10:29.922
So that's it? You're just giving up?

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.662
I'm the bad guy.

01:10:31.666 --> 01:10:35.279
I don't save the day.
I don't fly off into the sunset,

01:10:35.282 --> 01:10:37.470
and I don't get the girl.

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:39.530
I'm going home.

01:11:09.494 --> 01:11:11.632
Unless someone comes
to our aid soon,

01:11:11.638 --> 01:11:13.512
all may be lost.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:17.941
Thousands have already fled the city
in a mass exodus.

01:11:17.948 --> 01:11:22.080
Remaining citizens are warned, to stay
indoors until further notice.

01:11:23.595 --> 01:11:28.746
Authorities have issued a warning, to stay
out of the downtown area at all costs.

01:11:40.847 --> 01:11:41.854
Hal!

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.562
Hal!

01:11:45.743 --> 01:11:49.252
Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am,

01:11:49.253 --> 01:11:50.886
you've finally come to your senses.

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:52.378
Well, I'm over you.

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.175
I've come to stop you, Hal.

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:57.877
You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you
going to do, report me to death?

01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.883
I was going to try
reasoning with you.

01:12:00.132 --> 01:12:02.937
You and I, we worked together
for a long time.

01:12:02.938 --> 01:12:04.357
I know you.

01:12:04.358 --> 01:12:05.789
You don't know me.

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:08.216
You never took the time to know me.

01:12:08.221 --> 01:12:12.894
This is the first time we've hung out socially.
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.374
I want to talk to the real Hal.

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:18.357
I want to talk to the guy who loved being
a camera man, and eating dip,

01:12:18.359 --> 01:12:22.050
And being a nerd and being not as scary
as the Tighten-Hal.

01:12:22.052 --> 01:12:22.961
To late!

01:12:30.297 --> 01:12:31.389
Megamind.

01:12:33.288 --> 01:12:36.420
You and I have some unfinished business.

01:12:36.421 --> 01:12:40.852
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower,
oh, and just so you don't get cold feet.

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.624
Roxanne!

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:47.695
Come on Roxi, call for your hero
to come rescue you.

01:12:48.672 --> 01:12:49.940
Megamind.

01:12:51.148 --> 01:12:53.534
I don't even know if you're listening,
but if you are...

01:12:54.008 --> 01:12:56.148
You can't give up.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:01.487
The Megamind I knew would never
have run from a fight.

01:13:01.488 --> 01:13:05.216
Even when he knew he had absolutely
no chance of winning.

01:13:05.334 --> 01:13:07.538
It was your best quality.

01:13:07.858 --> 01:13:11.052
You need to be that guy,
right now.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:14.448
The city needs you.

01:13:16.673 --> 01:13:18.255
I need you.

01:13:18.256 --> 01:13:19.855
Roxanne.

01:13:19.856 --> 01:13:24.123
You have one hour.
Don't...keep me waiting.

01:13:25.695 --> 01:13:27.512
Warden, Warden!

01:13:27.513 --> 01:13:31.763
Listen to me, you have to let me go.
Tighten has to be stopped.

01:13:31.764 --> 01:13:35.561
Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life
sentences to go.

01:13:35.562 --> 01:13:38.071
Plenty of time to reflect on what
you've done.

01:13:38.072 --> 01:13:41.587
If you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.

01:13:41.589 --> 01:13:45.256
Here it is. From the blackest part of my heart.

01:13:47.874 --> 01:13:51.718
I....AM....Sorry!

01:13:53.866 --> 01:13:55.134
Not buying it.

01:13:57.526 --> 01:13:59.144
I don't blame you.

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:03.124
I've terrorized the city
countless times.

01:14:03.516 --> 01:14:06.636
Created a hero who's turned out
to be a villain.

01:14:06.644 --> 01:14:09.798
I lied to Roxanne.

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.317
My best friend, Minion.

01:14:13.517 --> 01:14:15.385
I treated like dirt.

01:14:17.481 --> 01:14:19.539
Please, don't make this city,

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:24.465
don't make Roxanne pay for my
wrong doings.

01:14:28.387 --> 01:14:29.966
Apology accepted.

01:14:33.264 --> 01:14:36.790
Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you.

01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:38.210
What are we waiting for?

01:14:38.211 --> 01:14:40.063
We'd better get going.

01:14:42.699 --> 01:14:43.888
You got me!

01:14:46.721 --> 01:14:48.269
Good luck, fellows.

01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:49.506
We're gonna die!

01:14:51.078 --> 01:14:51.829
Wait, what?

01:14:51.829 --> 01:14:54.281
Hey, Metro losers.

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:56.165
This is Metro Tower.

01:14:56.166 --> 01:14:59.415
They say it's suppose to be a
symbol of our cities strength.

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:04.762
But, for me, it's a reminder of the day
this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.

01:15:04.764 --> 01:15:07.306
And I hate reminders.

01:15:20.352 --> 01:15:21.528
HAL!

01:15:23.824 --> 01:15:25.054
Please don't do this.

01:15:25.055 --> 01:15:27.762
I know there's still good in you, Hal.

01:15:27.764 --> 01:15:29.261
You're so naive, Roxie.

01:15:29.262 --> 01:15:32.711
You see the good in everybody,
even when it's not there.

01:15:32.712 --> 01:15:34.587
You're living a fantasy.

01:15:35.022 --> 01:15:36.681
There is no Easter bunny.

01:15:36.682 --> 01:15:38.433
There is no tooth fairy.

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:40.359
And there is no Queen of England.

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:44.091
This is the real world.
And you need to wake up.

01:15:55.871 --> 01:15:59.255
You dare challenge Megamind?

01:15:59.587 --> 01:16:02.253
This town isn't big enough for
two super villains.

01:16:02.256 --> 01:16:05.634
Oh, you're a villain all right.

01:16:05.636 --> 01:16:07.664
Just not a super one.

01:16:07.665 --> 01:16:09.434
Yeah, what's the difference?

01:16:13.697 --> 01:16:15.377
PRESENTATION!

01:16:34.864 --> 01:16:36.042
I knew you'd come back.

01:16:36.043 --> 01:16:38.200
Well, that makes one of us.

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.600
-What's the plan?
-Well, mostly involves, not dying.

01:17:09.601 --> 01:17:10.769
I, like that plan.

01:17:34.852 --> 01:17:36.476
I can't control it.

01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:52.715
No!

01:17:55.985 --> 01:17:57.211
Well, that was easy.

01:17:57.637 --> 01:17:59.864
Looks like there's only one loose
end now.

01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:14.168
Please, let's have a little respect
for public transportation.

01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:16.634
You came back.

01:18:16.635 --> 01:18:18.196
You were right, Roxanne.

01:18:18.197 --> 01:18:20.142
I never should have left.

01:18:20.143 --> 01:18:22.387
Whoa, I...I thought you were dead.

01:18:22.388 --> 01:18:25.676
My death was, greatly exaggerated.

01:18:25.677 --> 01:18:29.064
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

01:18:30.814 --> 01:18:31.790
Ah!

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:45.593
I'm sorry, I did the best I could.

01:18:47.257 --> 01:18:48.981
I'm so proud of you.

01:18:53.001 --> 01:18:54.116
Minion?

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:57.521
Surprise! Heh, heh, heh.

01:18:57.966 --> 01:19:00.253
He's the real hero.

01:19:06.972 --> 01:19:08.312
Megamind.

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:11.158
Going somewhere?

01:19:12.058 --> 01:19:13.674
Besides jail.

01:19:21.124 --> 01:19:23.219
No, not in the face man, please.

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.654
If you know what's good
for you, Tighten.

01:19:24.655 --> 01:19:26.468
You'll stay out of Montrosity.

01:19:26.469 --> 01:19:27.796
-You got it!
-For good.

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:04.610
Pretty sneaky, sis.

01:20:05.211 --> 01:20:08.688
But there is only one person I
know who calls this town, Montrosity.

01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:09.692
Ooops.

01:20:10.356 --> 01:20:11.327
You!

01:20:14.423 --> 01:20:16.420
Bet you think it's really funny, huh?

01:20:18.098 --> 01:20:20.724
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh.

01:20:23.765 --> 01:20:25.731
You're not going to be laughing for long.

01:20:26.506 --> 01:20:30.034
The invisible car. Hey, remember
that night that I dumped you?

01:20:31.215 --> 01:20:33.292
You are bringing this up now?

01:20:33.293 --> 01:20:34.803
I did look back.

01:20:36.292 --> 01:20:37.509
You did?

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:39.057
YOU DID!

01:20:39.058 --> 01:20:42.697
Yes, and you should look back,
right now.

01:20:43.807 --> 01:20:45.335
Oh, I get it.

01:20:53.424 --> 01:20:55.940
This is the last time you'll make
a fool out of me.

01:20:55.941 --> 01:20:58.374
I made you a hero.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:02.128
You did the fool thing,
all by yourself.

01:21:08.876 --> 01:21:10.502
You're so pathetic.

01:21:10.503 --> 01:21:12.331
No matter what side you're on.

01:21:12.332 --> 01:21:14.139
You're always the looser.

01:21:14.501 --> 01:21:16.332
There's a benefit to loosing.

01:21:16.636 --> 01:21:18.812
You get to learn from your mistakes.

01:21:21.053 --> 01:21:22.053
What?

01:21:23.926 --> 01:21:25.961
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

01:21:25.962 --> 01:21:28.342
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:40.491
Enjoy your flight.

01:21:41.036 --> 01:21:42.250
AAAAAAAAH!

01:21:42.357 --> 01:21:43.852
Megamind.

01:21:51.443 --> 01:21:53.896
So, this is how it ends.

01:21:54.349 --> 01:21:58.398
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last
glorious failure.

01:21:59.868 --> 01:22:01.180
But not today!

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.418
What can I say?

01:22:03.843 --> 01:22:05.626
Old habits die hard.

01:22:12.273 --> 01:22:14.313
Say bye, bye Roxie.

01:22:19.151 --> 01:22:20.491
Ollo.

01:22:29.809 --> 01:22:32.911
Thing about bad guys,
they always LOOSE!

01:22:33.846 --> 01:22:35.133
Ohhhh.

01:22:37.847 --> 01:22:39.813
We did it, you won.

01:22:39.814 --> 01:22:43.055
Well, I finally had a reason to win.

01:22:44.074 --> 01:22:45.247
You.

01:22:53.554 --> 01:22:54.557
MINION!

01:22:54.586 --> 01:22:59.494
Can't see it's cold and...
warm, and dark and light.

01:22:59.502 --> 01:23:00.914
It's me, Minion.

01:23:00.917 --> 01:23:02.312
I'm right here.

01:23:02.316 --> 01:23:04.319
We've had a lot of adventures together.

01:23:04.323 --> 01:23:05.529
You and I.

01:23:05.531 --> 01:23:06.759
We have, Minion.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.295
I mean...

01:23:09.301 --> 01:23:13.810
most of them ended in horrible
failure, but,

01:23:13.817 --> 01:23:17.596
We won today.
Didn't we, sir?

01:23:17.597 --> 01:23:20.121
Yes Minion, we did it.

01:23:20.126 --> 01:23:21.501
Thanks to you.

01:23:21.504 --> 01:23:25.462
Code-We're the good guys now.

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:29.742
Code-I guess we are.

01:23:30.073 --> 01:23:33.033
Oh, oh. I'm going...I think this...

01:23:33.038 --> 01:23:35.759
This is it, I  mean I'm going far awa...

01:23:46.197 --> 01:23:48.141
Oh, what a drama queen.

01:23:48.969 --> 01:23:50.736
You know, I'm feeling much better now.

01:23:50.746 --> 01:23:52.526
I guess I just needed a swim

01:23:52.529 --> 01:23:54.338
-He had you, didn't he.
-Whew!

01:23:54.341 --> 01:23:56.882
Classic, Minion.
Don't give them the face.

01:23:56.888 --> 01:23:59.355
There he is with that
little face. Look at that face.

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.826
We did it!
We did it!

01:24:01.829 --> 01:24:03.941
-Fist pump!
-You did it!

01:24:03.945 --> 01:24:05.806
We won, we won, we won.

01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:09.862
What! Get back you savages!

01:24:09.868 --> 01:24:13.932
Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to
positive feedback.

01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:21.826
Funny, I guess destiny is not the
path given to us.

01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:26.891
But the path we choose
for ourselves.

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:37.250
All right, put your hands in the air.

01:24:40.808 --> 01:24:42.762
Now hand over your wallets.

01:24:42.763 --> 01:24:45.625
I'm just kidding.

01:24:45.626 --> 01:24:47.309
Just kidding.

01:24:47.313 --> 01:24:48.910
I have to admit.

01:24:48.914 --> 01:24:51.873
Being good, has its perks.

01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:55.713
You know, you look pretty good
in white.

01:24:56.025 --> 01:24:59.883
Megamind, if you please.

01:25:03.568 --> 01:25:05.799
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.

01:25:05.803 --> 01:25:07.871
Sorry my friend.

01:25:07.876 --> 01:25:11.936
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew you had it in you.

01:25:11.942 --> 01:25:15.179
Ladies and gentlemen...
MEGAMIND!

01:25:15.186 --> 01:25:17.919
Defender of Metro City.

01:25:19.763 --> 01:25:22.816
You know, I like the sound of that.

01:25:23.167 --> 01:25:24.200
Hit it!

01:25:25.031 --> 01:25:28.327
<i>*I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
Come On*</i>

01:25:28.333 --> 01:25:32.588
<i>*You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad-

come on.*</i>

01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:47.106
<i>*You Know I'm Bad, I'm Bad-
you know it.*
-I'm bad, I'm bad, that's right.</i>

01:25:47.838 --> 01:25:52.595
<i>*I'm bad, You know it, You Know it, You Know,*</i>

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.288
<i>*And The Whole World Has To

01:25:56.294 --> 01:25:57.515
