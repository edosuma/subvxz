WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:03.408
<i>...which for Yonkers
has been a long time coming.</i>

00:07.514 --> 00:10.515
And so, for all of us,
this special day

00:10.517 --> 00:13.101
is a validation
of the city's future.

00:17.858 --> 00:20.692
We're here today to
celebrate a new beginning,

00:20.694 --> 00:22.444
a new life
of a different sort.

00:22.446 --> 00:26.164
This one for five residents
of public housing,

00:26.166 --> 00:29.084
<i>who'll be the first to move</i>
<i>into the new townhouses.</i>

00:33.874 --> 00:36.424
<i>If those five residents</i>
<i>would please come forward,</i>

00:36.426 --> 00:38.210
<i>I would like, as the
mayor of Yonkers,</i>

00:38.212 --> 00:40.629
to present you each
with a symbolic key

00:40.631 --> 00:42.714
to your new townhouse.

00:42.716 --> 00:44.466
All right!

00:52.059 --> 00:55.727
- Thank you.
- Ooh. Ooh, look at this!

00:55.729 --> 00:57.779
Thank you, sir.

00:57.781 --> 01:01.866
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:01.868 --> 01:03.451
Yes, sir.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.380 --> 01:15.380
Mary. Hey!
Wh-where you been?

01:15.382 --> 01:17.082
Oh, hey, Jack.

01:17.084 --> 01:18.750
Everything good?
Nice to see you.

01:18.752 --> 01:20.635
We're making real
progress knocking down

01:20.637 --> 01:22.304
the affordable housing part
of the court order.

01:22.306 --> 01:24.923
- We-- we just need to keep the pressure on.
- Uh-huh.

01:24.925 --> 01:28.226
And the compromise plan
the council approved

01:28.228 --> 01:30.845
fell apart the day before they
were going to give it to Sand.

01:30.847 --> 01:34.266
Mary, we can stop
the next 800 units.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.434
Jack, the thing is

01:36.436 --> 01:39.654
affordable housing is for
people who can afford to rent.

01:39.656 --> 01:41.156
So it's not
the same thing.

01:41.158 --> 01:42.607
It's the same.

01:42.609 --> 01:45.160
It drops down property values,
it brings in the bad element.

01:45.162 --> 01:48.163
It's just I don't
agree with you, okay?

01:48.165 --> 01:49.781
They said you went
to the other side.

01:49.783 --> 01:50.999
I didn't believe them.

01:51.001 --> 01:52.667
You working with the
housing people now, right?

01:52.669 --> 01:54.953
They tried the same
program in Greenburgh

01:54.955 --> 01:56.454
and it worked, Jack.

01:56.456 --> 01:58.840
Bullshit! You really think
it could make a difference?

01:58.842 --> 02:00.258
Yes, I do.

02:00.260 --> 02:02.627
- These people live like animals...
- Whoa.

02:02.629 --> 02:05.096
...and you're sitting around
singing "Kumbaya,"

02:05.098 --> 02:06.715
please don't put trash
on my street.

02:06.717 --> 02:08.300
Good luck with that, Mary.

02:08.301 --> 02:09.768
Jack, do you hear yourself?

02:16.310 --> 02:18.443
And tonight you'll hear
not only from me

02:18.445 --> 02:21.479
but representatives
of the police department,

02:21.481 --> 02:23.448
the sanitation
department,

02:23.450 --> 02:26.067
the Housing Authority
Maintenance Office.

02:26.069 --> 02:29.321
Cheapest bid for moving
costs came in at 700.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.323
<i>And HUD isn't willing</i>
<i>to pay for that,</i>

02:31.325 --> 02:33.575
so how many of you
can afford $350?

02:33.577 --> 02:35.877
Half the cost?

02:37.748 --> 02:40.048
And if you had six months
to pay for that?

02:40.050 --> 02:42.500
That would help?

02:42.502 --> 02:43.802
Yeah?

02:43.804 --> 02:45.470
Security deposits
may not be used

02:45.472 --> 02:48.006
to pay rent
or other charges

02:48.008 --> 02:50.725
while tenants are occupying
the dwelling units.

02:50.727 --> 02:52.894
A show of hands for those
of you who could afford

02:52.896 --> 02:56.097
a washer-dryer
stack unit at $500.

02:56.099 --> 02:58.733
If there is illegal activity
within any of the units,

02:58.735 --> 03:00.852
<i>you can expect</i>
<i>a zero-tolerance approach</i>

03:00.854 --> 03:02.354
to anything that
comes to our attention.

03:02.356 --> 03:06.024
In which case, a tenant found to
be involved in illegal activity

03:06.026 --> 03:07.492
will be evicted.

03:07.494 --> 03:08.993
How many of you
have lawn mowers?

03:08.995 --> 03:11.913
Any drug involvement
by any member of your family

03:11.915 --> 03:13.915
will result in
immediate expulsion.

03:13.917 --> 03:16.868
And with more trash that can fit
inside the in-ground receptacle,

03:16.870 --> 03:19.671
it should be double-bagged
and sealed like this.

03:22.592 --> 03:24.759
Any questions?

03:24.761 --> 03:26.344
And you will, at times,
encounter members

03:26.346 --> 03:27.796
of a neighborhood
watch group

03:27.798 --> 03:29.931
who will be
patrolling the area.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.266
And-- yes, ma'am?

03:31.268 --> 03:32.634
Will the white folks
have to learn

03:32.636 --> 03:34.269
how to be good
neighbors as well?

03:34.271 --> 03:35.937
- Excuse me?
<i>- Yeah, what you mean,</i>

03:35.939 --> 03:37.522
<i>"neighborhood watch</i>
<i>group"?</i>

03:37.524 --> 03:38.973
Who are they watching, me?

03:38.975 --> 03:42.477
Yeah. And are those
people attending a course

03:42.479 --> 03:43.945
so they can learn
how to accept us?

03:43.947 --> 03:46.781
Like we're taking this course
to learn how to accept them?

03:46.783 --> 03:48.199
Mm-hmm.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.787
<i>Right.</i>

03:57.744 --> 04:01.746
You started out thinking
you wanted to make a move,

04:01.748 --> 04:03.882
<i>to live somewhere better,</i>

04:03.884 --> 04:06.668
but is that still
what you want?

04:06.670 --> 04:09.888
Do you still want to move
into these new homes

04:09.890 --> 04:11.473
in this new neighborhood,

04:11.475 --> 04:13.558
<i>given what you've heard,</i>
<i>what you've seen,</i>

04:13.560 --> 04:15.643
and what we've gone over?

04:17.596 --> 04:20.732
Everything has a cost.

04:20.733 --> 04:25.103
Every choice
means responsibility.

04:26.656 --> 04:29.324
And it will be different.

04:29.326 --> 04:31.443
Different isn't
always better.

04:32.996 --> 04:36.114
But it does mean
"different."

04:38.418 --> 04:40.618
So...

04:40.620 --> 04:42.787
let me ask you...

04:42.789 --> 04:45.206
<i>did you come here</i>
<i>to make your life</i>

04:45.208 --> 04:49.260
and the lives
of your family different?

04:56.102 --> 04:57.602
- You didn't.
- Oh, yeah.

04:57.604 --> 04:59.270
Hey, man,
I'm a hardheaded Polack.

04:59.272 --> 05:02.223
You don't play ball with me,
I shove the bat up your ass.

05:02.225 --> 05:04.108
- Are you fucking crazy, Nick?
- You know what?

05:04.110 --> 05:06.945
Maybe Zakian wasn't so bad
on the Parking Authority.

05:06.947 --> 05:09.481
Maybe I made a mistake
corralling votes to replace him.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.733
- A guy can learn, can't he?
<i>- Yeah, I get it.</i>

05:11.735 --> 05:13.318
You want to frost
Zaleski's balls,

05:13.320 --> 05:17.455
but, Nick, you already publicly supported
replacing Zakian with Bob Jean.

05:17.457 --> 05:18.696
For you to flip now--

05:18.697 --> 05:21.460
Look, Vinni, I'm the minority
leader on the council,

05:21.461 --> 05:24.996
and I'm just opening up the lines
of communication with my mayor.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.716
Don't look at me, Vin.

05:28.718 --> 05:30.251
I'm a simpleminded
Republican

05:30.253 --> 05:32.670
without a dog anywhere
near this fight.

05:32.672 --> 05:34.672
But I would like to be
a fly on the wall

05:34.674 --> 05:36.424
when Zaleski
gets the news.

05:40.897 --> 05:43.014
<i>Still on the truck.</i>

05:43.016 --> 05:45.567
<i>- Jose.</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

05:45.569 --> 05:47.485
<i>It ain't there.</i>

05:47.487 --> 05:50.271
<i>No, the other box.</i>

05:55.495 --> 05:58.329
<i>Where's this go?</i>

05:58.331 --> 06:01.165
<i>I think she wants that</i>
<i>'round back.</i>

06:01.167 --> 06:04.252
<i>This is heavier
than I thought.</i>

06:04.254 --> 06:05.870
<i>- Screwdriver.</i>
<i>- It's in the truck.</i>

06:05.872 --> 06:07.872
- Go get it.
- All right, ma'am.

06:07.874 --> 06:09.340
Thank you.

06:14.381 --> 06:15.847
Ah!

06:15.849 --> 06:17.599
<i>This going inside?</i>

06:17.601 --> 06:19.133
- You gonna help me?
- Yeah.

06:19.135 --> 06:21.553
You gonna help me?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.104
Thank you, Johnny.

06:23.106 --> 06:25.189
Yeah, you hold that.
Right?

06:25.191 --> 06:28.560
Good Lord,
the junk you have.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.312
Daddy says he's giving you
the couch in the basement.

06:31.314 --> 06:32.947
He says not to argue.

06:35.118 --> 06:36.618
Have you seen Jaron?

06:39.122 --> 06:40.572
Jaron?

06:40.574 --> 06:42.040
Jaron!

06:54.588 --> 06:56.471
I-- in my room,
I have this window,

06:56.473 --> 06:58.640
and it looks out into, what,
like four, five trees--

06:58.642 --> 07:00.425
Mom, come see
the bedrooms.

07:00.427 --> 07:02.393
Yeah, do you want to
go see them?

07:02.395 --> 07:04.846
Yeah, we should get going.
Felipe.

07:06.099 --> 07:08.099
But you don't need
to leave yet...

07:10.437 --> 07:12.687
Roberto, come.
Time to go.

07:15.108 --> 07:16.858
<i>Maria.</i>

07:19.412 --> 07:20.612
Maria.

07:33.009 --> 07:36.377
- Bye,<i> mi chiquito.</i>
- Bye. Love you.

07:38.632 --> 07:41.132
It's a really
beautiful house.

07:41.134 --> 07:42.967
- <i> Gracias,</i> Carmen.
- Thank you,<i> Tia.</i>

07:44.354 --> 07:46.387
- 157?
- Yeah, 157.

07:46.389 --> 07:47.972
- You know what we forgot?
- What?

07:47.974 --> 07:50.141
- Okra.
- Oh, we'll never hear the end of it.

07:50.143 --> 07:51.476
You'll never hear
the end of it.

07:51.478 --> 07:52.727
Go home, niggers!

07:52.729 --> 07:55.947
Yeah, you, you goddamn
porch monkeys!

07:55.949 --> 07:57.482
<i>Damn it!</i>

08:01.538 --> 08:02.820
Go ahead.

08:09.329 --> 08:10.995
- The bottom shelf?
- Yeah.

08:10.997 --> 08:12.130
<i>Hey, Mama.</i>

08:12.132 --> 08:14.465
<i>Dwayne, is that you?</i>

08:15.552 --> 08:16.918
And Libby.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.505
We brought you and Tash
some groceries.

08:20.507 --> 08:21.923
- Oh.
- How you making out?

08:21.925 --> 08:23.841
I don't know.

08:23.843 --> 08:26.227
- It's gonna take some getting used to.
- Uh-huh.

08:27.397 --> 08:31.182
It's beautiful, Norma.
Just beautiful.

08:31.184 --> 08:33.267
- What y'all get us?
- Oh, uh, uh...

08:33.269 --> 08:34.902
- Nillas?
- Bam!

08:34.904 --> 08:37.105
- Okay.
- Oh, I can make myself banana pudding.

08:43.663 --> 08:46.030
Nick, did you
see this?

08:46.032 --> 08:48.449
You're quoted here
saying that I told you

08:48.451 --> 08:50.835
Bob Jean's
mismanaging the YPA.

08:50.837 --> 08:53.538
Yeah.
"Herald Statesman," right?

08:53.540 --> 08:56.207
I never fucking
said that.

08:56.209 --> 08:58.042
Yeah, I'm just
having a little fun.

08:58.044 --> 09:00.261
I'm bringing back John Zakian
to the Parking Authority.

09:00.263 --> 09:01.512
I'm gonna replace
Bob Jean.

09:01.514 --> 09:03.381
At my expense?

09:03.383 --> 09:05.099
It's okay.
I got the votes.

09:05.101 --> 09:07.552
I talked to Nick Spano,
and he's gonna get his guy to go for it,

09:07.554 --> 09:08.886
so that makes three.

09:08.888 --> 09:11.639
Nick, when you got rid of Zakian,
he was my boss,

09:11.641 --> 09:13.441
- but the mayor had your back.
- <i> Yeah?</i>

09:13.443 --> 09:15.777
So, now you're gonna
go against the mayor

09:15.779 --> 09:17.145
to try and fire
my new boss?

09:17.147 --> 09:18.863
Yeah.
You're gonna be fine.

09:18.865 --> 09:20.732
I got the votes.
I'm telling you, trust me.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.700
What is it that you're
trying to accomplish with this?

09:22.702 --> 09:24.452
- I'm just letting him know.
- Know what?

09:24.454 --> 09:26.204
That you have
some votes at the YPA?

09:26.206 --> 09:28.039
That I'm still here,
God damn it!

09:29.709 --> 09:31.409
I gave him
everything he has.

09:31.411 --> 09:34.295
I gave him-- I pushed
the housing through,

09:34.297 --> 09:37.582
I gave him the strong-mayor charter,
the patronage, the power.

09:37.584 --> 09:39.333
I stepped aside
to let him be mayor.

09:39.335 --> 09:42.170
I did all that,
and I paid for it, and I bled for it.

09:44.507 --> 09:46.007
<i>I'm not gonna</i>
<i>be ignored.</i>

09:46.009 --> 09:49.343
If Zaleski doesn't
wanna give me my due, that's fine.

09:49.345 --> 09:52.897
I'm just gonna make him look like
the jackass that he is.

09:52.899 --> 09:54.265
Nick.

09:55.985 --> 09:57.101
Just trust me.

10:44.984 --> 10:46.984
Where's Tasha?

10:46.986 --> 10:49.237
I think she went to bed
a while ago.

10:49.239 --> 10:51.956
<i>Yeah, you sure got
a lot of stuff here, Ma.</i>

10:51.958 --> 10:55.743
- Mm-hmm.
- The moving man did a job today, didn't he?

10:55.745 --> 10:57.161
Dwayne, honey,
I don't think

10:57.163 --> 10:59.330
I can keep my eyes
open much longer.

11:01.551 --> 11:03.501
I don't think
they're coming back.

11:03.503 --> 11:05.503
Who?

11:05.505 --> 11:07.505
Who not coming back?

11:07.507 --> 11:08.890
<i>No one, Ma.</i>

11:14.681 --> 11:16.981
When we were parking
the car out front,

11:16.983 --> 11:19.517
a couple of guys
drove past.

11:19.519 --> 11:21.352
Some words were said.

11:21.354 --> 11:22.687
What'd they say?

11:24.157 --> 11:26.858
What did they say?

11:31.781 --> 11:33.581
Oh.

11:33.583 --> 11:35.533
Libby's right,
Mama.

11:35.535 --> 11:37.118
They're gone.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.453
Well, of course
they gone.

11:39.455 --> 11:41.289
Y'all need
to be gone, too.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.925
Come on, go on.
I'm fine.

11:46.129 --> 11:48.045
All right.

11:53.636 --> 11:55.720
- Good night.
- Good night, baby.

12:12.622 --> 12:14.739
<i>I'll take Danny McGuire here.</i>

12:14.741 --> 12:16.908
<i>He knows the ropes. Don't you, Danny?</i>

12:16.910 --> 12:19.577
<i>Sure, I've had 'em</i>
<i>around my neck for years.</i>

12:23.583 --> 12:26.217
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Oh, Miss Blodgett.</i>

12:26.219 --> 12:27.919
<i>Danny McGuire,</i>
<i>our new tenant.</i>

13:10.596 --> 13:14.015
<i>Oh, could you possibly
use me a picture, Mr. McGuire?</i>

13:14.017 --> 13:15.766
<i>Of course, I haven't had</i>
<i>much experience, but...</i>

13:21.391 --> 13:23.190
Boy, get up.
Time to go.

13:23.192 --> 13:26.560
We're going to Grandma's.
Okay, that's it, that's it.

13:26.562 --> 13:29.647
Here.

13:29.649 --> 13:31.899
Yeah.

13:31.901 --> 13:33.818
Come on.
Come on.

13:36.372 --> 13:38.572
Huh?

13:38.574 --> 13:41.826
<i>I'm gonna be
here three more years,</i>

13:41.828 --> 13:43.828
and you have to run
for reelection next year.

13:43.830 --> 13:45.329
And I promise you--

13:45.331 --> 13:47.548
this Parking Authority
stunt goes forward,

13:47.550 --> 13:50.418
we will primary you against
someone who can bury you.

13:50.420 --> 13:53.170
- Bring it.
- Nick, please, don't pick this fight.

13:53.172 --> 13:54.588
You barely got by
last year,

13:54.590 --> 13:55.840
and that was
before redistricting.

13:55.842 --> 13:57.842
Terry, don't throw
numbers at me, all right?

13:57.844 --> 14:00.261
I can run citywide,
and Jim knows it.

14:00.263 --> 14:03.147
<i>And if it wasn't for Martinelli
splitting the votes last year,</i>

14:03.149 --> 14:05.316
Pete Chema would be
sitting in that seat, not you.

14:05.318 --> 14:08.269
What'd you win with,
a kick-ass 36%?

14:08.271 --> 14:09.987
Shit.

14:12.492 --> 14:15.993
You want Bob Jean
off the Parking Authority?

14:15.995 --> 14:17.111
Fine.

14:17.113 --> 14:19.697
But there is
no way in hell

14:19.699 --> 14:21.532
that we can put John Zakian
back in there.

14:21.534 --> 14:24.251
Name a replacement we can live with,
and you got him.

14:26.622 --> 14:27.788
I don't know, Terry.

14:27.790 --> 14:29.840
I've really come
to like John Zakian.

14:38.384 --> 14:40.267
Damn!

14:49.395 --> 14:51.312
You messin'
with my head, girl.

14:54.233 --> 14:56.233
Damn, we got
the stairs, too, baby?

15:13.386 --> 15:15.803
Hey! No, no!

15:15.805 --> 15:17.755
Oh!

15:17.757 --> 15:18.973
<i>Hey!</i>

15:18.975 --> 15:21.642
Hey, come back here,
you motherfuckers!

15:26.766 --> 15:28.182
<i>Hey, yo!</i>

15:34.690 --> 15:39.443
Two guys, black,
20 or 25 years.

15:39.445 --> 15:41.245
Do you remember
what they were wearing?

15:41.247 --> 15:43.697
- Any distinguishing marks?
- It happened too fast.

15:43.699 --> 15:45.783
They were waiting for me
as I turned the corner.

15:45.785 --> 15:48.619
I-- I had just cashed my paycheck
at Getty Square,

15:48.621 --> 15:52.373
did some shopping, and then I
walked up here to visit my aunt.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.424
How much cash
did you have?

15:54.677 --> 15:57.511
$300 in an envelope
in my purse.

15:57.513 --> 15:59.880
You're just lucky
nothing worse happened to you.

15:59.882 --> 16:01.715
<i>I know.</i>

16:01.717 --> 16:05.019
I found this in a dumpster.
Yours?

16:05.021 --> 16:08.939
Anything else?
My packages?

16:08.941 --> 16:10.941
Nah, nothing like that.
Sorry.

16:10.943 --> 16:13.811
<i>Is this your place</i>
<i>of residence, miss?</i>

16:13.813 --> 16:16.230
No. I'm in
the townhouses now.

16:16.232 --> 16:17.982
I don't live here
anymore.

16:31.747 --> 16:32.963
Nay?

16:37.720 --> 16:39.086
I just heard.

16:39.088 --> 16:41.305
You happy now, Nick?

16:41.307 --> 16:43.557
Now that
I have no job?

16:43.559 --> 16:45.643
I'm gonna fix this.

16:45.645 --> 16:48.229
I'm gonna
fix this, okay?

16:48.231 --> 16:50.347
- I will.
- <i> How?</i>

16:50.349 --> 16:52.600
Bob Jean is telling
everyone he fired me

16:52.602 --> 16:55.352
because I'm incompetent.

16:55.354 --> 16:57.321
Jesus, Nick.

16:57.323 --> 16:59.657
<i>How am I gonna get another
job with that reputation?</i>

16:59.659 --> 17:00.658
I thought
I had the votes.

17:00.660 --> 17:02.109
I thought
I fucking had those votes.

17:02.111 --> 17:03.444
Nick Spano
thought so, too.

17:03.446 --> 17:06.196
He feels really bad about it,
you getting fired.

17:06.199 --> 17:09.333
Right.
Well, fuck it, you know?

17:10.786 --> 17:13.037
How could you
play politics with our lives?

17:16.041 --> 17:17.758
I'm so sorry.

17:18.877 --> 17:20.461
Yeah.

17:20.463 --> 17:22.680
I am.

17:30.690 --> 17:32.273
Okay, if there's
nothing else.

17:32.275 --> 17:33.891
Oh, I-- I got
something else.

17:33.893 --> 17:36.443
Someone needs to teach
our neighbors some manners.

17:36.445 --> 17:37.945
Yeah, they all
sit there

17:37.947 --> 17:40.564
on their steps across the street
and stare at us.

17:40.566 --> 17:42.650
All the time, staring.

17:42.652 --> 17:44.151
- Yep.
- Yeah.

17:44.153 --> 17:45.569
You think
I'm kidding?

17:50.326 --> 17:52.459
<i>And sometimes</i>
<i>I have to go in my house</i>

17:52.461 --> 17:54.878
and pull the shades down
just to get away from them.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.718
If-- if I were you,
I'd just go about my business.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.554
If you see them,
say hello.

18:03.556 --> 18:06.340
Yeah, if they don't
say hello back, then fine,

18:06.342 --> 18:09.426
but at least no one can accuse you
of not being polite.

18:09.428 --> 18:10.811
And that's what
we've been doing.

18:10.813 --> 18:12.813
- And what about the dogs?
<i>- Yeah. Ooh.</i>

18:12.815 --> 18:14.231
- What dogs?
- The...

18:14.233 --> 18:16.150
- Look, they walk them over...
- Yeah.

18:16.152 --> 18:18.936
...and the dogs
do their business on our lawns.

18:18.938 --> 18:20.904
One woman with, like,
three white poodles

18:20.906 --> 18:22.773
and a man
with a Rottweiler.

18:22.775 --> 18:25.326
<i>They're the worst with it.</i>

18:25.328 --> 18:29.363
Okay, so I guess
we tell the neighborhood

18:29.365 --> 18:31.081
to curb their dogs.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.500
Mm-kay.

18:33.502 --> 18:36.754
So, the next item
is to elect officers

18:36.756 --> 18:38.505
of the tenants'
association.

18:39.959 --> 18:41.625
Any volunteers?

18:48.517 --> 18:51.719
You can't begin to govern
yourselves without officers.

18:56.809 --> 18:58.309
Doreen,
it's my understanding

18:58.311 --> 19:00.110
you had experience
before this

19:00.112 --> 19:01.979
on a tenants' council.

19:04.150 --> 19:06.650
Sorry, I don't think
I'm interested.

19:07.987 --> 19:09.536
<i>Don't look at me.</i>

19:09.538 --> 19:11.288
So, I spoke to Nick Spano,
and no surprise,

19:11.290 --> 19:13.157
he wants Joan Deierlein
as city clerk.

19:13.159 --> 19:14.992
Now, Spencer's
on board.

19:14.994 --> 19:16.994
- He's gonna sponsor the resolution.
- Okay.

19:16.996 --> 19:19.747
Now, Madeline,
she's retiring November 2,

19:19.749 --> 19:22.499
and Kathleen Walsh
is gonna step up to first deputy clerk,

19:22.501 --> 19:24.968
which leaves a vacancy
at second deputy,

19:24.970 --> 19:26.837
and a Democrat
needs to fill that.

19:28.140 --> 19:30.841
- And?
- And everybody

19:30.843 --> 19:33.761
was kinda thinking
that Nay could have that spot.

19:33.763 --> 19:35.512
Are the Republicans
on board with that?

19:35.514 --> 19:36.730
Yeah, well, Spencer
and Fagan are.

19:36.732 --> 19:38.682
I'm not sure
about Dickerson or Sal.

19:38.684 --> 19:40.651
- Mm.
- Spano's behind Nay's appointment,

19:40.653 --> 19:43.437
because he feels bad
about that switched YPA vote.

19:43.439 --> 19:44.772
You know I had
a limousine

19:44.774 --> 19:46.073
waiting to take him
to make the vote,

19:46.075 --> 19:47.941
and he still switched,
that fuck.

19:47.943 --> 19:49.276
Yeah, it's not like
the old days

19:49.278 --> 19:50.744
when a bought guy
stayed bought.

19:50.746 --> 19:52.446
Yeah, well,
it really put me in the doghouse,

19:52.448 --> 19:54.114
- that's for sure.
- I warned you about that, Nick.

19:54.116 --> 19:55.616
I know, and I'm
making it right now.

19:55.618 --> 19:56.617
- Okay?
- Mm.

19:56.619 --> 19:58.202
I owe it to Nay.

19:59.338 --> 20:00.754
So, listen...

20:03.459 --> 20:06.293
John, he's gonna sponsor it
as majority leader.

20:06.295 --> 20:07.711
But it'd be
really great to get

20:07.713 --> 20:09.380
a bipartisan
show of support.

20:09.382 --> 20:13.050
Now, ordinarily, the minority leader
would cosponsor,

20:13.052 --> 20:15.769
but, Christ, I can't
put my name on something

20:15.771 --> 20:18.272
that gives my wife a job
working for the council,

20:18.274 --> 20:20.224
so I'm gonna abstain
from the vote.

20:20.226 --> 20:25.229
But, Vinni, would you
sponsor with Spencer?

20:31.620 --> 20:33.153
Sure.

20:33.155 --> 20:34.371
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:38.494 --> 20:40.544
I really appreciate that.

20:49.722 --> 20:53.757
Thomas Downer, parole agent
for John Mateo Santos.

21:28.127 --> 21:29.376
The boy favors you.

21:31.297 --> 21:34.181
John Billie.
And this Shanda.

21:36.135 --> 21:39.803
John, your mother resides
at 321 Bruce Avenue?

21:39.805 --> 21:42.439
You told the prison caseworker
you were going to live with her.

21:42.441 --> 21:44.975
I was, but that
was a mistake.

21:44.977 --> 21:47.394
This the right
address now.

21:47.396 --> 21:49.279
This one.

21:50.649 --> 21:52.983
- Miss Rowan, this is your apartment?
- Mm-hmm.

21:52.985 --> 21:55.652
Well, here are the rules--
I will come by the house.

21:55.654 --> 21:57.905
I might come early,
I might come late.

21:57.907 --> 21:59.540
I need to check
that John lives here,

21:59.542 --> 22:01.542
<i>that there are no drugs,</i>
<i>alcohol,</i>

22:01.544 --> 22:03.794
<i>or illegal activity</i>
<i>of any sort.</i>

22:03.796 --> 22:06.830
Do you agree
to allow me into your house?

22:06.832 --> 22:08.549
Do you agree to have Mr. Santos
staying with you?

22:16.675 --> 22:18.892
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Be good.</i>

22:18.894 --> 22:20.511
<i>Okay, Mommy.</i>

22:24.266 --> 22:27.067
So, if they could stop
tossing their litter

22:27.069 --> 22:29.436
on this side of the street,
it would help.

22:29.438 --> 22:32.322
Another concern is

22:32.324 --> 22:34.408
<i>the neighborhood residents</i>
<i>walk their dogs,</i>

22:34.410 --> 22:38.362
and they've been
letting them go

22:38.364 --> 22:40.030
on the townhouse lawns.

22:40.032 --> 22:42.282
And maybe they're used
to it being an empty lot,

22:42.284 --> 22:45.702
but, specifically,
there's a lady with three poodles...

22:45.704 --> 22:49.339
Yes, and-- and a man
with a big ol' Rottweiler.

22:49.341 --> 22:50.874
- Right.
- There's the poodle lady now.

22:52.127 --> 22:53.427
Where, Mama?

22:53.429 --> 22:55.379
Lieutenant Gelman,
why don't you go have a word?

22:55.381 --> 22:56.964
- Sure.
- Oh.

22:56.966 --> 22:58.882
Excuse me.

23:06.025 --> 23:10.727
Uh, another complaint,

23:10.729 --> 23:13.146
Captain Reid,
is the staring.

23:13.148 --> 23:17.284
We can't do anything
about people looking at other people,

23:17.286 --> 23:20.203
so maybe the police
can't really help us with this,

23:20.205 --> 23:23.490
but the silent stares

23:23.492 --> 23:25.826
from the neighborhood
residents...

23:25.828 --> 23:30.547
uh, in the absence of any
friendly interactions

23:30.549 --> 23:31.999
have become unnerving,

23:32.001 --> 23:33.917
especially
for the kids.

23:33.919 --> 23:35.719
I can see
there would be.

23:35.721 --> 23:38.005
But you're right
that there isn't much in my authority

23:38.007 --> 23:40.474
to deal with that.

23:40.476 --> 23:42.593
Won't happen again.

23:43.812 --> 23:44.728
Oh.

23:48.267 --> 23:51.602
Uh, I think
that's-- that's it.

23:51.604 --> 23:53.153
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

23:53.155 --> 23:54.271
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.082
If you bought a box,

24:05.084 --> 24:07.334
we wouldn't have
to make the drive so often.

24:07.336 --> 24:08.452
Yeah, but I like
the drive.

24:08.454 --> 24:11.338
I like seeing
Yonkers at night.

24:11.340 --> 24:13.674
I know.

24:13.676 --> 24:15.626
Anyway,
the clerk's job is a done deal,

24:15.628 --> 24:17.544
so at least
I cleaned up after myself.

24:17.546 --> 24:18.712
That's all
I was saying.

24:18.714 --> 24:22.099
- Yeah, you made the mess.
- Yeah, I know.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.269
All right,
what about you?

24:26.271 --> 24:29.139
I'm sure that Zaleski and Surdoval
are gonna redistrict you now.

24:29.141 --> 24:31.108
- Yeah, they already have.
- Oh, yeah?

24:31.110 --> 24:32.643
Yeah, if I read
the ward maps right,

24:32.645 --> 24:35.445
they're gonna put me in a district
that's 60% Hispanic.

24:35.447 --> 24:37.648
My people.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.865
Yeah, I'll teach
you to say

24:38.867 --> 24:40.817
"vote early and often"
in Spanish.

24:40.819 --> 24:43.153
No, Fuentes
is gonna run.

24:43.155 --> 24:45.155
So I'm behind
the eight ball.

24:46.992 --> 24:48.408
I don't know
that I can hang on

24:48.410 --> 24:50.210
the way they've
gerrymandered me.

24:50.212 --> 24:51.878
Fucking Zaleski.

24:54.049 --> 24:57.668

25:44.967 --> 25:46.850
Good evening, miss.
You all right?

25:55.360 --> 25:57.360
You sure this
is a good idea?

25:57.362 --> 26:00.530
Yeah.
Yeah, it's fine.

26:00.532 --> 26:01.782
Come on.
We're here already.

26:03.786 --> 26:05.736
I'll wait here.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.571
- Go.
- All right, all right.

26:20.886 --> 26:23.170
Can't sleep?

26:23.172 --> 26:24.588
Yeah.

26:40.773 --> 26:44.241
I'm pregnant,
John... again.

26:45.444 --> 26:47.110
It worked.

26:49.615 --> 26:52.532
What worked?

26:52.534 --> 26:54.868
I made pinholes
in the rubber.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.207
You did what?

27:05.097 --> 27:06.463
Seemed like the love
you felt for me

27:06.465 --> 27:08.682
wasn't there no more.

27:08.684 --> 27:12.352
'Cause you always say,
"I never wanted these kids."

27:14.473 --> 27:16.606
I guess I wanted
to know if it was true.

27:18.193 --> 27:19.810
How the fuck...?

27:21.029 --> 27:22.863
I can't.

27:22.865 --> 27:24.815
- I can't do this anymore.
- What?

27:26.368 --> 27:29.119
You gonna have
an abortion?

27:29.121 --> 27:30.787
You gonna kill
something we made?

28:02.487 --> 28:05.105
Hi, good evening.
I'm Councilman Nick Wasicsko.

28:05.107 --> 28:07.073
I was mayor when the housing
was approved,

28:07.075 --> 28:09.359
and, uh, I just
wanted to check in,

28:09.361 --> 28:10.744
find out how things
were going.

28:10.746 --> 28:12.696
You from housing,
at this hour?

28:12.698 --> 28:14.698
No, no, no.
I'm not from housing.

28:14.700 --> 28:16.533
I'm-- I was, uh...

28:19.371 --> 28:21.004
Not from housing.
I was the fucking mayor.

28:21.006 --> 28:23.256
Mayor?
Are you sure?

28:23.258 --> 28:24.541
I thought the mayor
was something

28:24.543 --> 28:27.878
with a "Z,"
a "Zoo-ski" or something.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.880
Uh, that's
the current mayor.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.715
I was the mayor
at the time

28:31.717 --> 28:33.383
that this housing
was approved.

28:33.385 --> 28:34.718
Nah, I don't know
anything about that.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.386
You got the wrong unit.

28:50.285 --> 28:52.485
He-- hello, ma'am.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

28:52.487 --> 28:55.238
Uh, my name
is Nick Wasicsko.

28:55.240 --> 28:58.541
I was the mayor when these
houses were approved,

28:58.543 --> 29:01.378
and I just-- I was
in the neighborhood,

29:01.380 --> 29:04.047
and I just wanted to see how
the residents were doing here.

29:04.049 --> 29:06.716
- What'd you say your name was?
- Wasicsko.

29:06.718 --> 29:09.419
Nick Wasicsko.

29:09.421 --> 29:12.589
Yes.
I remember you.

29:12.591 --> 29:15.809
- From the news.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:15.811 --> 29:17.560
You the man they spit on.

29:17.562 --> 29:20.513
Yeah, I remember you
for sure.

29:24.403 --> 29:26.436
Yes, well, uh...

29:26.438 --> 29:28.738
are you happy
with the house?

29:28.740 --> 29:30.607
I'd like to think
it was worth it.

29:32.661 --> 29:35.111
I could ask you
the same thing.

29:40.702 --> 29:44.421
Yes, well...
you take care.

29:44.423 --> 29:46.006
You have a nice night.

29:46.008 --> 29:47.924
Good night.

29:50.629 --> 29:52.712
So, I want
to thank you all

29:52.714 --> 29:54.297
for a job
well done,

29:54.299 --> 29:55.548
for all
your hard work

29:55.550 --> 29:57.467
in making the housing
initiative a success.

29:57.469 --> 30:00.020
This will conclude
our efforts.

30:00.022 --> 30:01.638
Wait.
Wait a minute.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.223
You mean
it's over?

30:03.225 --> 30:05.358
- Just like that?
- The job is done.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.977
You mean
the funding ran out.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.029
I mean,
our job is done.

30:09.031 --> 30:10.780
There are still problems
with those units

30:10.782 --> 30:12.482
with the neighborhood.

30:12.484 --> 30:14.534
The worst hasn't
happened, Mary,

30:14.536 --> 30:16.236
and the best
will depend on them.

30:16.238 --> 30:17.871
Their future is theirs.

30:17.873 --> 30:20.123
We can't hold
their hands forever.

30:20.125 --> 30:22.542
Sorry, but we can't
just drop them, either.

30:22.544 --> 30:24.828
We-- we can't--

30:24.830 --> 30:26.830
Well, I'm not
gonna leave them.

30:26.832 --> 30:28.999
I mean, I'm just gonna go back to
the townhouses and the meetings,

30:29.001 --> 30:31.718
and I'll help them in any
way I can, if they ask me.

30:31.720 --> 30:35.171
Mrs. Dorman...
you're a good neighbor.

30:36.475 --> 30:37.891
I want to thank
you all again.

30:53.692 --> 30:55.909
Lucille's not
coming back.

30:55.911 --> 30:59.195
Mayhawk told them
the program's over.

30:59.197 --> 31:00.864
What?

31:00.866 --> 31:02.115
<i>She and Mary
Dorman asked me to run</i>

31:02.117 --> 31:03.533
the Trenchard-Gaffney
meeting

31:03.535 --> 31:05.201
until you all
have an election.

31:05.203 --> 31:06.503
Oh, man.

31:06.505 --> 31:08.204
All right?

31:09.508 --> 31:11.124
Now, first
is this thing

31:11.126 --> 31:13.543
about our kids not going
on the bus trip to Playland.

31:13.545 --> 31:16.463
Housing says it's only
for West Side children.

31:16.465 --> 31:17.630
Uh-uh, wait a minute.

31:17.632 --> 31:19.382
We part of municipal
housing, too.

31:19.384 --> 31:22.635
I know,
but that's their rule.

31:22.637 --> 31:24.471
<i>So, instead, I think</i>
<i>we should have</i>

31:24.473 --> 31:26.723
a party for
our own kids here.

31:26.725 --> 31:30.894
Okay? An end-of-school party
before summer gets too hot.

31:34.483 --> 31:37.067
Look, if we're
gonna do this,

31:37.069 --> 31:40.236
it has to be about more than
repairing leaky faucets

31:40.238 --> 31:41.905
and storing lawn mowers.

31:43.241 --> 31:47.327
I'm talking about really
getting together, okay?

31:47.329 --> 31:49.879
Doing things the way
neighbors are supposed to.

31:55.220 --> 31:56.920
<i>She's right.</i>

31:56.922 --> 31:59.255
Maybe we should do this.

32:00.559 --> 32:02.926
<i>We should.</i>

32:02.928 --> 32:06.563
Okay. So, for
an end-of-school party,

32:06.565 --> 32:09.182
we should have a list of what
everybody's going to bring.

32:09.184 --> 32:10.934
Yeah, and don't everybody
bring hot dogs.

32:10.936 --> 32:12.352
All right,
fair enough.

32:12.354 --> 32:13.903
And we'll have it
right out here,

32:13.905 --> 32:16.239
even though housing don't want
the children running around.

32:16.241 --> 32:18.024
We don't care what housing wants.
Don't worry about it.

32:18.026 --> 32:19.943
Now, about
the Con Ed bills...

32:21.196 --> 32:22.579
<i>Yeah?</i>

32:23.665 --> 32:25.615
- Heya.
- Hey.

32:28.620 --> 32:30.453
Ah-- no, no, no.

32:30.455 --> 32:32.539
You cracked it last time,
and then we talked business

32:32.541 --> 32:34.757
and I felt bad about
breaking our rule.

32:34.759 --> 32:36.709
Business-- ew.

32:36.711 --> 32:39.629
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the worst kind. Politics.

32:39.631 --> 32:41.297
Blah.

32:41.299 --> 32:44.601
So, listen, I, um--
I can't run again in the Second.

32:44.603 --> 32:46.553
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

32:46.555 --> 32:48.021
Right.

32:48.023 --> 32:50.223
Yeah, they fixed me good,
didn't they?

32:50.225 --> 32:52.308
And, um...

32:52.310 --> 32:54.444
well, I've been thinking.

32:54.446 --> 32:56.813
Uh-oh.

32:56.815 --> 32:59.649
I'm gonna run
for City Court judge.

32:59.651 --> 33:01.818
What the hell,
you know, I'm qualified,

33:01.820 --> 33:03.119
I've got
a law degree,

33:03.121 --> 33:05.622
and, uh, well, I just--

33:05.624 --> 33:07.490
I need you to carry
my petitions for me, Vinni.

33:07.492 --> 33:09.292
Christ, Nick.

33:09.294 --> 33:11.995
I already promised
my support to Joan Pincus.

33:14.216 --> 33:15.915
Joan Pincus?

33:15.917 --> 33:17.050
Yeah.

33:22.257 --> 33:25.558
Okay.
Joan Pincus, huh?

33:25.560 --> 33:27.060
What is she to you?

33:28.513 --> 33:31.514
Well, I-- look,
I feel like shit right now,

33:31.516 --> 33:35.902
but how was I to know
you were going to throw in for city judge?

33:35.904 --> 33:38.238
You know,
I-- I already gave Joan my word.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.073
I'm not gonna go
back on that now.

33:40.075 --> 33:41.324
I'm sorry.

33:42.661 --> 33:44.577
Hey, uh...

33:55.207 --> 33:56.923
All right, Vinni.

34:16.194 --> 34:17.893
Poodle Lady!

34:23.118 --> 34:24.567
Poodle Lady.

34:26.204 --> 34:28.071
Bye, Poodle Lady.

34:28.072 --> 34:29.405
Bye, poodles.

34:41.168 --> 34:43.002
Come on, Ma.

34:44.922 --> 34:48.123
You need to save that money
you done worked so hard for.

34:48.126 --> 34:49.676
It's my money.

34:49.678 --> 34:52.178
Now, I wanna take my mama
out to lunch, okay?

34:52.179 --> 34:54.297
What you got
a taste for?

34:54.299 --> 34:56.599
You know I always
liked the Sizzler.

34:56.601 --> 34:58.468
Oh, Ma, I do not
want to take the bus

34:58.470 --> 35:00.186
all the way
back downtown.

35:00.188 --> 35:02.889
We here now, right?
How about the Clam House?

35:02.891 --> 35:05.308
- The Clam House?
- Yeah.

35:05.310 --> 35:07.777
I-- I never
been there.

35:11.650 --> 35:13.066
- Come on.
- Oh!

35:13.068 --> 35:14.901
It won't hurt none.

35:33.972 --> 35:35.888
<i>Come in.</i>

35:37.008 --> 35:39.425
He's here.

35:39.427 --> 35:41.094
Send him in.

35:41.096 --> 35:42.679
Councilman?

35:47.686 --> 35:50.320
Nick, have a seat.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.530
Come on.

36:14.045 --> 36:15.545
I'll be right
with you.

36:15.547 --> 36:16.879
Mr. Zorzi.

36:26.524 --> 36:29.308
Is they all white people in here?

36:29.310 --> 36:32.278
Uh... yeah.

36:32.280 --> 36:34.063
Two?

36:34.065 --> 36:37.200
Uh... I think
we won't be staying.

36:37.202 --> 36:38.451
Ma.

36:38.453 --> 36:39.902
You sure?

36:42.991 --> 36:46.743
No, we'll just
order to go, please.

36:56.588 --> 36:58.254
Thank you.

37:04.929 --> 37:06.763
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

37:06.765 --> 37:09.315
When are you gonna get
to the kitchen cabinets?

37:09.317 --> 37:11.234
They've been in boxes
for a month now already.

37:11.236 --> 37:13.069
- Yeah, yeah. It's on my list.
- Yeah, okay--

37:13.071 --> 37:15.071
Um, listen,
I'm gonna--

37:15.073 --> 37:17.440
I'm gonna
primary Vinni.

37:17.442 --> 37:18.524
Zaleski's
gonna back me.

37:18.526 --> 37:19.742
He's gonna put me
on the ticket

37:19.744 --> 37:23.162
and throw me enough cash
to mount the campaign, so...

37:23.164 --> 37:24.497
Great.

37:24.499 --> 37:25.748
You know, I can't--

37:25.750 --> 37:27.200
I can't run
in my own district,

37:27.202 --> 37:28.501
and I can't
sit this one out

37:28.503 --> 37:30.336
- if I want to run for mayor next time.
- <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

37:30.338 --> 37:33.039
So I don't really got
another choice.

37:33.041 --> 37:34.791
So you go
with Terry Zaleski,

37:34.793 --> 37:37.710
and you turn
against your friend?

37:37.712 --> 37:39.262
<i>You know what?</i>

37:39.264 --> 37:41.130
I'm gonna volunteer
for Vinni.

37:41.132 --> 37:42.799
<i>That's right.</i>

37:42.801 --> 37:45.518
I'm for Vinni Restiano
for council president.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.220
This is bullshit.

37:58.983 --> 38:00.066
Police! Freeze!

38:00.068 --> 38:01.651
- Hey!
- Oh! No!

38:01.653 --> 38:03.319
- Get off!
- That's the guy.

38:03.321 --> 38:04.403
- That's him!
- Get on the ground!

38:04.405 --> 38:06.122
She's on the third floor,
bleeding bad!

38:06.124 --> 38:07.957
- I didn't hurt nobody!
- Keep your mouth shut!

38:07.959 --> 38:09.625
Shut up!

38:10.912 --> 38:12.245
Is his name
on the lease?

38:12.247 --> 38:13.713
Oh, no, not
on the lease.

38:13.715 --> 38:15.331
Well, where
is he living, then?

38:15.333 --> 38:18.134
And why would he give this address?

38:35.019 --> 38:36.152
Hey.

38:36.154 --> 38:37.520
Hey, Vinni.

38:37.522 --> 38:39.822
What a fucking coward
you turned out to be, huh?

38:39.824 --> 38:42.024
- Hey, come on. - You couldn't
come in and tell me in person?

38:42.026 --> 38:44.360
You couldn't pick up the phone and
give me a call yourself, huh?

38:44.362 --> 38:46.362
It's not personal.
You know that. It's politics.

38:46.364 --> 38:49.248
Oh, please!
You and I both know that lie, remember?

38:49.250 --> 38:51.033
I don't have
any other options here.

38:51.035 --> 38:52.835
Me, neither, Nick.

38:52.837 --> 38:54.754
But don't think this is
gonna be easy for you.

38:54.756 --> 38:56.756
I got a little Yonkers
in me, too.

38:56.758 --> 38:59.125
- Vinni, come here, have a drink with me.
- No, you don't--

38:59.127 --> 39:03.629
I gotta know--
do you even believe in anything,

39:03.631 --> 39:06.716
anything other than
yourself?

39:08.686 --> 39:11.304
- Hmm?
- I'm sorry.

39:11.306 --> 39:13.389
Fuck you!

39:38.750 --> 39:41.834
The reason I'm running
is because of Mrs. Restiano's

39:41.836 --> 39:44.387
growing inability
to work with Mayor Zaleski.

39:44.389 --> 39:46.589
And, frankly,
I'm disillusioned.

39:46.591 --> 39:49.842
I have worked with the Republican
majority on the council

39:49.844 --> 39:53.596
to produce unanimous votes
92% of the time.

39:53.598 --> 39:56.766
Mrs. Restiano works only too well
with the Republican majority

39:56.768 --> 39:59.352
as an enemy
of our Democratic mayor.

39:59.354 --> 40:02.438
In fact, Nick and I
have voted the same way

40:02.440 --> 40:04.740
98% of the time,

40:04.742 --> 40:07.910
that is, until he decided
to run against me.

40:10.498 --> 40:13.532
Get over it, Nick.
People are on to you.

40:17.372 --> 40:20.840
The girl got her hearing notice
threatening eviction.

40:20.842 --> 40:22.625
City housing already
trying to throw her

40:22.627 --> 40:25.378
and her kids
out of doors.

40:25.380 --> 40:27.797
Well, if she lied
on her lease...

40:32.186 --> 40:33.803
We all lied.

40:35.857 --> 40:37.773
It's a game they rig up.

40:37.775 --> 40:40.693
If we have a man and he's
kicking in a little money for his kids,

40:40.695 --> 40:43.029
we gotta lie
so the rent doesn't go up

40:43.031 --> 40:44.146
or so we don't
get put out

40:44.148 --> 40:46.482
if ever he did anything wrong
once upon a time.

40:46.484 --> 40:50.069
- Yeah, but--
- She didn't cause the trouble,

40:50.071 --> 40:51.570
and her kids didn't,

40:51.572 --> 40:54.490
and the trouble didn't happen
anywhere near her home.

40:54.492 --> 40:56.208
But the whole
housing program's

40:56.210 --> 40:58.044
under fire
right now, Doreen,

40:58.046 --> 41:00.162
so they're gonna
make an example out of her.

41:00.164 --> 41:01.964
But he's the asshole
for using her address.

41:01.966 --> 41:03.666
But you know what?
She shouldn't have let him stay there

41:03.668 --> 41:05.384
if his name's
not on the lease.

41:05.386 --> 41:07.503
I'm sorry,
the stakes are too high.

41:07.505 --> 41:09.338
But he's her man.

41:09.340 --> 41:12.475
He fathered those kids.

41:12.477 --> 41:14.143
Look, people get busted,

41:14.145 --> 41:16.729
they use the men's shelter
as their address.

41:16.731 --> 41:19.315
There's a whole lot of men
in public housing,

41:19.317 --> 41:21.017
but not on the lease.

41:21.019 --> 41:24.320
- Well?
- <i> And not just men, either.</i>

41:24.322 --> 41:27.523
I mean,
my sister Gail lives with me.

41:29.944 --> 41:32.361
We lie,

41:32.363 --> 41:36.198
but they make these rules
as if we're children.

41:54.385 --> 41:55.885
I'm going to die
on that waiting list.

41:55.887 --> 41:57.636
Because that lady
was killed,

41:57.638 --> 41:59.605
I don't think they're ever gonna build
more townhouses now.

41:59.607 --> 42:01.223
Same as before--
yelling, protesting.

42:01.225 --> 42:02.975
I started looking
at apartment ads--

42:02.977 --> 42:04.310
three times as much
as Schlobohm

42:04.312 --> 42:06.562
and so filthy,
I wouldn't keep pigs there.

42:06.564 --> 42:08.197
<i>In the present situation,</i>

42:08.199 --> 42:10.199
<i>it's the citizens</i>
<i>of East Yonkers</i>

42:10.201 --> 42:12.785
<i>on whom we need to rely.</i>

42:12.787 --> 42:16.072
Because the reality is that
the budget constraints

42:16.074 --> 42:19.241
limit our ability to deploy
additional personnel

42:19.243 --> 42:21.243
<i>to resolve those issues.</i>

42:21.245 --> 42:23.796
Now, another point
that we need to discuss...

42:23.798 --> 42:25.798
- Excuse me, sir?
- ...with the homeowners--

42:25.800 --> 42:27.133
Excuse me, sir.

42:27.135 --> 42:29.085
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

42:30.755 --> 42:32.421
My name
is Doreen Henderson.

42:32.423 --> 42:34.590
I represent
the Andrew Smith Townhouses

42:34.592 --> 42:37.476
on Gaffney Place
and Trenchard Street.

42:37.478 --> 42:39.228
I want to talk about
what I think

42:39.230 --> 42:41.397
a lot of people
are thinking about--

42:41.399 --> 42:44.483
the new townhouses and that lady
who was murdered across town.

42:44.485 --> 42:47.903
<i>The tenants are very upset</i>

42:47.905 --> 42:51.574
about what those two city councilmen
said last night on the TV

42:51.576 --> 42:53.826
about the kind
of people we are,

42:53.828 --> 42:56.779
and we're upset that they want
to screen people at the sites

42:56.781 --> 42:59.165
and check on who we have as
company and things like that.

42:59.167 --> 43:01.700
How would they like it if that
kind of thing was said about them?

43:01.702 --> 43:04.870
I'm sure they would be upset.

43:04.872 --> 43:08.791
The tenants
are decent people.

43:08.793 --> 43:11.794
And the tenant who might be evicted
because of this is, too.

43:13.264 --> 43:15.097
That man, Santos,
it shouldn't be assumed

43:15.099 --> 43:17.883
that he lived on Gaffney Place
just because he said so.

43:17.885 --> 43:19.852
Yes. Yes, ma'am. I--

43:21.355 --> 43:22.638
Yes, ma'am.

43:24.559 --> 43:27.526
I just wanted to say that as
commander of Second Precinct

43:27.528 --> 43:28.944
where most of
the townhouses are,

43:28.946 --> 43:30.946
we haven't really had
any unusual problems

43:30.948 --> 43:33.816
at any of the sites
or with the residents.

43:35.820 --> 43:37.620
<i>Thank you.</i>

43:37.622 --> 43:40.573
<i>Thank you, Captain, for your
assessment of the situation.</i>

43:40.575 --> 43:42.074
Is that one of yours, Bob?

43:42.076 --> 43:45.578
Lucille Lantz
had high hopes for her.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.329
She is proved right.

43:47.331 --> 43:50.916
<i>...we will of course
continue to offer protection</i>

43:50.918 --> 43:53.719
<i>and service</i>
<i>like we did before.</i>

43:53.721 --> 43:55.137
Miss Rowan, do you have
a statement to make

43:55.139 --> 43:56.889
before we hear testimony?

43:59.310 --> 44:01.644
Very well.

44:01.646 --> 44:03.729
We'll hear first
from Thomas Downer

44:03.731 --> 44:06.182
of the New York State
Division of Parole.

44:14.826 --> 44:17.743
Officer Downer,
you are John Santos's parole officer?

44:17.745 --> 44:18.994
Yes.

44:28.089 --> 44:30.005
How you been,
Billie?

44:31.125 --> 44:32.708
I'm Doreen.

44:32.710 --> 44:35.010
I remember you
from Schlobohm.

44:35.012 --> 44:37.463
Yeah, I live
around the way now.

44:37.465 --> 44:39.849
Good to get out
of Schlobohm, right?

44:41.135 --> 44:44.353
Got my eviction notice.

44:44.355 --> 44:46.605
Gotta get a new apartment,
I guess.

44:46.607 --> 44:50.059
Girl, listen, you can't
let them do this.

44:50.061 --> 44:51.894
Your man screwed you,

44:51.896 --> 44:54.730
but don't screw yourself double
by not fighting back.

44:57.235 --> 44:59.401
Billie, do you love
living here?

45:00.538 --> 45:03.372
Do your children
love living here?

45:07.245 --> 45:09.411
Come on.

45:09.413 --> 45:11.997
We gonna call
legal aid together.

45:28.432 --> 45:29.899
You voting today?

45:36.941 --> 45:38.691
Who you voting for?

45:38.693 --> 45:41.193
It's called a secret ballot
for a reason.

45:43.447 --> 45:44.947
Of course
I'm voting for you.

45:52.456 --> 45:53.539
Bye.

46:08.105 --> 46:11.023
- Hello?
- <i> Nay, it's Vinni.</i>

46:11.025 --> 46:13.642
Vinni, uh,
you just missed him.

46:13.644 --> 46:16.278
I'm-- I'm sorry
it's come to this.

46:16.280 --> 46:18.647
He betrayed me, Nay,

46:18.649 --> 46:20.532
and he's done
the same to you.

46:20.534 --> 46:22.952
<i>You need to know this.</i>

46:22.954 --> 46:25.821
He wasn't sleeping alone
on those trips to Albany.

46:27.408 --> 46:30.159
Ask him about
the Desmond Hotel.

46:30.161 --> 46:31.827
<i>I know</i>
<i>what happened there.</i>

46:46.010 --> 46:47.893
- It's sick.
- What?

46:47.895 --> 46:50.095
And wrong.

46:50.097 --> 46:51.680
Fuck him.

46:52.900 --> 46:54.600
Fuck him.

46:57.857 --> 47:01.493
_

47:15.006 --> 47:16.422
Miss O'Neal?

47:16.457 --> 47:18.957
It's me, Billie,
from 175.

47:19.010 --> 47:21.126
Sorry for walking
on your grass.

47:21.178 --> 47:22.628
It's nice grass,
too, right?

47:22.680 --> 47:24.380
How are ya?

47:24.382 --> 47:25.764
I'm okay.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.216
Listen, I don't mean
to bother you,

47:27.268 --> 47:29.635
but legal aid is trying to keep me
from being evicted.

47:29.687 --> 47:31.720
And it helps if I could get
some-- some neighbors

47:31.722 --> 47:34.056
to sign a petition
saying I wasn't a problem.

47:34.058 --> 47:35.974
Well, you're
not to me.

47:36.027 --> 47:38.644
Thank you,
Miss Norma.

47:38.696 --> 47:40.729
Oh, she can't...

47:40.731 --> 47:44.033
Let's go inside and sit
and do this right.

47:44.068 --> 47:47.569
I can come back. I mean, if
you have to be somewhere.

47:47.621 --> 47:49.738
Just to vote.
You voted yet?

47:49.790 --> 47:50.989
Uh, no.

47:51.042 --> 47:53.242
Habit with me.

47:53.294 --> 47:56.578
But I can't say
it seem to fix much.

47:56.580 --> 47:59.965
Likely to do more good today
signing your thing.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.667
Come on in the house,
though, baby.

48:01.719 --> 48:02.718
You need the keys.

48:02.753 --> 48:04.086
I wanna say
a special thank you

48:04.138 --> 48:06.722
for all of you who worked
so hard today out there

48:06.757 --> 48:09.925
manning the polls,
getting our message out.

48:11.479 --> 48:14.596
<i>Thank you all so much</i>
<i>for all...</i>

48:14.648 --> 48:17.149
I need another
fucking beer.

48:18.402 --> 48:20.652
<i>Thank you.</i>

48:20.688 --> 48:25.607
<i>This is a bit</i>
<i>of a bittersweet victory.</i>

48:25.609 --> 48:27.576
Nick...

48:27.611 --> 48:29.995
what happened
at the Desmond Hotel?

48:31.866 --> 48:34.950
The Desmond
in Albany?

48:36.504 --> 48:39.371
Nothing. Why? Was something
supposed to happen?

48:42.209 --> 48:43.959
Never mind.

48:43.961 --> 48:47.296
<i>...including Mayor Zaleski.</i>

48:47.298 --> 48:50.516
<i>It was a situation</i>
<i>that was unnecessary...</i>

48:50.551 --> 48:52.134
Yeah?

48:52.136 --> 48:54.803
<i>...and a situation that
should not be repeated again...</i>

48:54.889 --> 48:56.305
What are
the last wards left?

48:57.975 --> 48:59.808
<i>And now the results...</i>

48:59.860 --> 49:00.976
Yeah, thanks.

49:01.028 --> 49:04.363
<i>Tonight I intend to ask</i>
<i>for the resignation</i>

49:04.398 --> 49:06.448
<i>of the Yonkers</i>
<i>Democratic Party.</i>

49:08.452 --> 49:10.786
Well, you gave it
a run, Nick.

49:10.821 --> 49:12.488
Vinni was the incumbent,
but you--

49:14.375 --> 49:15.574
You gave it
a good shot.

49:15.626 --> 49:17.459
Got close.

49:17.495 --> 49:19.628
Yeah.

49:19.663 --> 49:22.381
Well, that's
twice in a row

49:22.416 --> 49:23.749
I've lost
running citywide,

49:23.801 --> 49:25.134
so by the rules
of the game,

49:25.169 --> 49:26.969
I'm done as a candidate.

49:30.641 --> 49:33.509
So, what do you have for me
in the administration?

49:41.435 --> 49:43.185
Jim...

49:44.188 --> 49:46.071
promises were made.

49:46.106 --> 49:48.607
Promises?

49:54.198 --> 49:57.449
You're just gonna,
you know,

49:57.501 --> 49:59.868
just use me up
like that?

49:59.870 --> 50:00.919
You gonna run me
against Vinni,

50:00.955 --> 50:02.371
and that way you get rid
of one of us, right?

50:02.373 --> 50:05.424
Okay.
Well...

50:05.459 --> 50:07.676
Hey, and don't think
I didn't see that, um--

50:07.711 --> 50:11.547
that, uh, report
in "The Herald Statesman" yesterday.

50:11.549 --> 50:14.099
That investigation
of the IDA you guys are doing,

50:14.134 --> 50:15.801
that secretary
that stole some money?

50:15.853 --> 50:18.604
- What about it?
- That's the last bullet, right?

50:18.639 --> 50:20.138
Wh-what do you mean?

50:20.191 --> 50:24.643
As mayor,
I was chairman of the IDA, Jim.

50:24.695 --> 50:27.729
But I didn't steal shit. You look at
my bank account, I didn't steal anything.

50:27.781 --> 50:31.233
- Then don't worry-- - Yeah, but I'm
still gonna get investigated anyway?

50:31.235 --> 50:34.286
If I'd have beat Vinni, you would've
come at me with that bullshit anyway.

50:34.321 --> 50:37.122
I get Vinni for you,
but then you get me, is that right?

50:37.157 --> 50:38.457
- Nick...
- Huh?

50:38.492 --> 50:41.827
I don't have a pot
to piss in, Jim!

50:41.879 --> 50:43.495
I didn't steal,
but you wanna take

50:43.547 --> 50:44.746
what's left
of my reputation?

50:44.748 --> 50:46.248
You wanna tear
that down as well?

50:46.300 --> 50:48.217
- Nick, you need to calm down, okay?
- Fuck you, Jim!

50:48.252 --> 50:51.053
And you tell Zaleski
I said fuck him, too!

50:51.088 --> 50:53.055
Piece of shit.

50:56.477 --> 50:58.093
We work
for trucks.

50:58.095 --> 51:00.729
Yeah, we work
for garbage trucks.

51:00.764 --> 51:04.733
Let's clean up
so everybody can get this dirt away.

51:08.772 --> 51:09.771
Poodle Lady.

51:09.773 --> 51:11.773
<i>Poodle Lady.</i>

51:17.748 --> 51:20.115
<i>My name is Jaron.</i>

51:20.117 --> 51:22.284
What's their names?

51:26.290 --> 51:30.208
Martini, Brandy,
and Alexander.

51:35.549 --> 51:37.549
Do you like dogs?

51:38.552 --> 51:39.801
Yes.

51:39.803 --> 51:41.637
- Soft, isn't he?
- Yes.

51:41.689 --> 51:44.890
<i>Yeah. Somebody's
playing behind you here.</i>

51:44.942 --> 51:46.725
He's really excited.

51:46.777 --> 51:47.943
<i>22 up!</i>

51:47.978 --> 51:49.444
<i>AC plain</i>
<i>and a full house.</i>

51:49.480 --> 51:52.531
You should have
gotten a haircut.

51:52.566 --> 51:55.117
You should have
taken off of work.

51:55.152 --> 51:56.868
Seriously.

51:56.904 --> 51:58.654
I think you would
look much better

51:58.706 --> 52:00.822
with shorter hair.

52:00.824 --> 52:02.658
I think you'd look better
without eyebrows.

52:04.328 --> 52:06.995
I can't do that.
I can't take them out.

52:08.632 --> 52:11.500
As it so happens, I made
an appointment for tomorrow.

52:11.502 --> 52:14.753
- For your hair?
- Mm-hmm.

52:14.805 --> 52:17.422
- That's good.
- Mm-hmm.

52:17.474 --> 52:20.392
Oh, God, it's almost 2:00.
You gotta get me back.

52:20.427 --> 52:22.728
- No, I'll be in trouble.
- Play hooky with me.

52:22.763 --> 52:24.763
- I can't.
- Come on.

52:24.815 --> 52:26.815
I can't, and you
are going to go back

52:26.850 --> 52:30.268
and help your brother
with the cabinets today.

52:30.321 --> 52:31.687
Okay.

52:33.273 --> 52:35.357
What's that face?

52:39.413 --> 52:42.581
- It's just...
- Nothing from Surdoval?

52:44.251 --> 52:46.118
No, no, no.
There's nothing for me there.

52:46.170 --> 52:47.619
They made that
very clear.

52:47.671 --> 52:48.870
Well, screw them.

52:48.922 --> 52:50.539
Seriously.
Screw them.

52:50.541 --> 52:52.791
You can teach,
you can practice law,

52:52.843 --> 52:56.345
you can do whatever
the fuck you want now.

52:56.380 --> 52:58.547
Yeah. Screw them.

52:58.549 --> 53:00.048
Yeah.

53:01.935 --> 53:03.602
Let's go.
It's late.

53:03.637 --> 53:06.054
Is your stomach better?

53:06.056 --> 53:07.973
Yeah, it's okay.

53:08.025 --> 53:11.109
Okay.

53:16.900 --> 53:18.567
Bye, thank you.

53:20.237 --> 53:22.487
- Hey, Nay. Nay.
- What?

53:22.489 --> 53:24.122
This, uh--
this IDA thing,

53:24.124 --> 53:25.824
- they're gunning for me.
- No.

53:25.826 --> 53:27.492
Listen, Zaleski,
Surdoval,

53:27.494 --> 53:29.578
they've got Maniglia
and these other creeps digging into it,

53:29.580 --> 53:31.880
- like everyone's corrupt except for them.
- Nick...

53:33.751 --> 53:37.219
- Who cares what they think?
- I care. I care. It's my reputation.

53:37.221 --> 53:39.254
You haven't done anything wrong.
You're innocent.

53:39.256 --> 53:41.723
That's not the point.
It doesn't matter what you...

53:41.725 --> 53:44.309
Innocence is no defense.
It's politics, Nay.

53:44.311 --> 53:45.927
It's a smear job.

53:45.929 --> 53:47.979
Okay, so what?
Let go.

53:47.981 --> 53:49.898
It's done.
Do something new.

53:49.900 --> 53:51.566
Cut it.
I gotta go.

53:51.568 --> 53:54.486
Nay, just--
take the day off with me.

53:54.488 --> 53:56.938
I can't.

53:56.940 --> 53:58.607
I can't.

53:58.609 --> 54:01.359
You know Vinni is looking
for any excuse to fire me,

54:01.361 --> 54:03.111
and you know that.

54:06.283 --> 54:08.283
I need you
to snap out of it.

54:08.285 --> 54:11.119
- Do it for me, please?
- Okay.

54:12.623 --> 54:14.256
You'll be okay.

54:14.258 --> 54:15.540
- We'll be okay.
- Okay.

54:15.542 --> 54:17.793
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

54:20.264 --> 54:21.797
Let's go.

54:23.100 --> 54:24.633
- Give me a smile.
- Go, go--

54:24.635 --> 54:26.218
Give me a kiss.

54:31.475 --> 54:33.642
Roberto, Maria!

54:37.147 --> 54:40.315
- Where is Felipe?
- Playing videos in his room.

55:02.172 --> 55:03.839
Get your brother,

55:03.841 --> 55:05.140
and get your jackets.

55:05.142 --> 55:06.591
Where are we going?

55:06.593 --> 55:08.844
Get your jackets.

55:11.148 --> 55:12.230
...the fuck you're doing.

55:12.232 --> 55:14.149
I know what you
and Biondi are up to.

55:14.151 --> 55:16.184
You're fucking
Zaleski's hatchet boys

55:16.186 --> 55:19.237
with your press leaks
and your innuendos.

55:19.239 --> 55:22.023
By the time the truth comes out,
it won't matter.

55:22.025 --> 55:24.159
Anyone who's against you
gets trashed, is that right?

55:24.161 --> 55:26.361
- If you didn't do anything, then
what's the problem? - Then what?

55:26.363 --> 55:28.914
Then you'll tell
people that later?

55:28.916 --> 55:31.616
<i>I spoke to your auditor,</i>
<i>I told him everything I know,</i>

55:31.618 --> 55:33.251
and the next day, it was
in the fucking newspaper.

55:33.253 --> 55:35.420
- You're making a scene, Nick.
- Fuck you, Andy!

55:35.422 --> 55:39.508
- No, fuck you!
- And fuck all this investigation bullshit!

55:39.510 --> 55:43.094
You don't want the truth.
You're out for blood.

55:43.096 --> 55:45.013
Isn't that right?

55:46.600 --> 55:48.183
This is ridiculous.

55:54.358 --> 55:56.358
<i>I never liked that guy.</i>

56:13.827 --> 56:15.243
Hmm.

56:16.830 --> 56:20.081
I don't know
where anything is.

56:28.559 --> 56:31.476
I lose everything.
I can't fucking find anything.

56:48.495 --> 56:50.328
Oh, fuck.

56:54.167 --> 56:55.917
Hey, Nick.

56:55.919 --> 56:57.168
Come on, help me
with these.

56:57.170 --> 56:59.454
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm coming.

56:59.456 --> 57:00.872
I'll be right there,
all right, Mike?

57:19.526 --> 57:21.443
Hey, Mike? Mike?

57:24.865 --> 57:27.899
Hey, Mike?

57:27.901 --> 57:29.484
Come here.

57:46.169 --> 57:48.586
But they didn't find anything.

57:59.182 --> 58:00.899
Fuck!

58:42.642 --> 58:44.809
It's about time.

58:48.565 --> 58:49.898
Nick?

58:54.237 --> 58:56.988
- Give it here. Here.
- No, I'm telling!

58:56.990 --> 58:59.074
- Stop being a baby.
- No.

58:59.076 --> 59:02.127
- I'm not being a baby. I'm not
being a baby. - Just give it to me.

01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:29.414
No.
Are you serious?

01:01:25.438 --> 01:01:27.856
Excuse me, please.
Sorry.

01:01:27.858 --> 01:01:29.691
Cemetery's closed 5:30.

01:01:32.145 --> 01:01:35.280
Oh, you're the mayor!

01:01:35.282 --> 01:01:37.615
On TV I saw you.

01:01:39.402 --> 01:01:42.370
I'm leaving
in just a few moments.

01:01:42.372 --> 01:01:44.656
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

01:01:44.658 --> 01:01:46.157
Thank you.
