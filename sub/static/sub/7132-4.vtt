00:12.291 --> 00:15.166
Am I totally confused,
or are these ratings
not good?

00:15.166 --> 00:18.000
No, you're not
confused at all.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Do we pull it?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.250
And replace it
with what?

00:20.250 --> 00:22.709
I can actually
feel the acid
eating my stomach.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.333
Should we talk about
what happened?

00:24.333 --> 00:27.000
I had fun.
Me too.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.000
So I have obviously
no reason to feel guilty.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.125
Absolutely none.

00:30.125 --> 00:31.333
And it's not like
we're even together.
No.

00:31.333 --> 00:35.542
We're not together.
We are... Not.

01:33.583 --> 01:34.917
Oh, I'll come back.

01:34.917 --> 01:37.125
No, no, it's okay.
Come in.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.375
Oh!
Look at these numbers.

01:43.375 --> 01:44.542
I've seen them.

01:44.542 --> 01:45.625
No, no, look. Look!

(SIGHS)

01:48.333 --> 01:49.417
They're terrible.
I know.

01:49.959 --> 01:51.166
Why don't we have
a dance show?

01:51.166 --> 01:53.041
You said there were
enough dance shows.

01:53.041 --> 01:54.041
Really, I can come back.

01:54.041 --> 01:56.750
Every fucking dance show
is killing us.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.959
Who wants to watch
other people dance?

01:59.583 --> 02:01.333
People will watch anything.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.750
Obviously not.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.917
I don't have
one goddamn night
that's working.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.959
Not one!
All my new shows
are tanking. Why?

02:08.291 --> 02:09.458
I don't know.

02:09.458 --> 02:12.208
And  Pucks!,
what the hell
happened to  Pucks!?

02:12.208 --> 02:14.417
Research is all over it.
We'll fix it.

02:14.417 --> 02:16.500
I look at these ratings,
and it's like 9/11.

02:16.792 --> 02:18.750
It's not like 9/11.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.208
It's like watching
the Towers fall.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.083
It's nothing like that.

02:22.083 --> 02:23.458
This is my Ground Zero.

02:23.458 --> 02:27.125
By the way, this is
not better than
your Holocaust analogy.

02:27.375 --> 02:31.041
Look, we will recover
from this.
Everything is cyclical.

02:31.458 --> 02:33.959
We will laugh about this
someday.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.291
Not if we make
a show out of it.

02:35.709 --> 02:39.583
Listen to me.
We will come back
stronger than ever.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.458
What if we don't?

02:42.458 --> 02:45.250
What if this is the time
it just keeps getting worse?

02:49.709 --> 02:51.333
I liked being on top.

02:52.625 --> 02:57.542
Oh, I know you did.
You'll be on top again.

02:58.458 --> 02:59.500
Will I?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.166
Oh, baby...

STOKE: We go down again?

03:23.709 --> 03:26.625
Not just down,
it's like a fucking
bungee jump.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.208
Oh, shit.

03:30.542 --> 03:31.750
Oh, man.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.458
You know
what just keeps
going up?

03:33.458 --> 03:35.667
That fucking
talking dog show.

03:37.291 --> 03:38.333
You know, I could've
been on that...

03:38.333 --> 03:39.917
Oh, my God, we know!
Jesus Christ, let it go!

03:39.917 --> 03:41.542
I'm just saying.

03:42.542 --> 03:44.458
SEAN: Oh, I got
a message for you.
Yeah?

03:44.458 --> 03:46.125
Some woman friend-ed me
on Facebook.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.709
She says she knows you
and needs to
get back in touch.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.834
You're on Facebook?
Uh-huh.

03:49.834 --> 03:50.917
What's her name?

03:50.917 --> 03:52.166
It's actually
an odd one.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.959
Oh, shit,
is it Labia?

03:53.959 --> 03:56.667
Yes! Is that really
how it's pronounced?

03:56.667 --> 03:57.792
It's not Lahbia
or Labeea?

03:57.792 --> 03:59.041
Nope. Labia.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.583
As in...
Labia.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.458
Since when are you
on Facebook?

04:02.458 --> 04:03.625
I don't know,
a couple of months.

04:03.625 --> 04:04.750
She's my stalker.

04:04.750 --> 04:05.917
Facebook. Wow.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.250
He's got a stalker
named Labia

04:07.250 --> 04:08.709
and that's what
you're focusing on?

04:08.709 --> 04:11.500
It's, like, Hungarian
or Polish or some shit.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.542
I'm just surprised.
We always made fun
of people on Facebook.

04:14.542 --> 04:16.583
They wore me down.
Pretty much
everyone's on it.

04:16.583 --> 04:18.417
Your mother's
on Facebook.

04:18.417 --> 04:20.333
My mother's on Facebook?
We're Facebook friends.

04:20.917 --> 04:23.583
You and my mother.
You're not
real life friends.

04:23.583 --> 04:24.917
For some reason
I like her better this way.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.041
Perhaps 'cause
you can't hear her voice.

04:26.041 --> 04:27.792
Yeah, listen.
You gotta
un-friend her.

04:27.792 --> 04:30.208
Seriously,
she's a fucking nut bag.
But you saw her picture.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.291
She's pretty
hot, huh?

04:32.291 --> 04:34.041
And that's important
in a stalker?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.375
It's important, period.

04:36.625 --> 04:37.834
You need us?

04:37.834 --> 04:40.166
Your 11 o'clock
pitch meeting
with the network is now.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.542
Hi, Matt.
Hey.

04:41.542 --> 04:42.625
Okay. Off we go.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.041
Off we go.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.041
All right.
The first story's
a bit of a road trip

04:52.041 --> 04:53.375
for Lyman
and Nicola.

04:53.375 --> 04:54.375
Fun.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.959
SEAN: So, it's Nicola's
sister's wedding.

04:55.959 --> 04:58.125
But there's a huge blizzard
and no planes are flying.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.458
Uh-oh.

04:59.458 --> 05:02.083
Nicola's car
is buried under
a mountain of snow,

05:02.083 --> 05:05.125
so Lyman offers to
drive her in his truck.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.792
Can I just jump in?
Quick thought.

05:07.542 --> 05:11.333
What if,
instead of Nicola's sister
getting married,

05:11.333 --> 05:14.000
it's one of
the Boys' sisters?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.333
That's fun.

05:16.709 --> 05:18.333
Well, that would be
a very different story.

05:18.333 --> 05:21.041
It's just a way
to get all the Boys
in there.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.125
And why are all the Boys
going to this wedding?

05:23.125 --> 05:24.792
What if it's
not a wedding?

05:24.792 --> 05:28.458
Right. What if
it's, like, a big game
they don't want to miss?

05:28.458 --> 05:29.959
A big game
in a blizzard?

05:29.959 --> 05:31.458
Why does it even
have to snow?

05:31.458 --> 05:34.083
Yes, why is there
ever weather, really?

05:34.792 --> 05:38.709
So, now Lyman's
taking the Boys
to a big game...

05:39.375 --> 05:42.000
Look, obviously
none of us are writers...

05:42.000 --> 05:43.166
BOTH: Obviously...

05:43.166 --> 05:44.667
But, what if,

05:44.667 --> 05:48.500
the Boys take
Lyman's truck without
his permission?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.625
Ooh, that's nice
and stakesy.

05:50.875 --> 05:54.208
So the only part
of our story that's left is
there's a truck.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.041
What if
there's not?

05:57.041 --> 05:59.625
All right, stop.
Just...stop.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.333
Tell us
what is going on.

06:06.041 --> 06:08.500
(HESITATES) Okay.
It's the ratings.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.000
You told us not to worry
about the ratings.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.375
Yeah, you can start now.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.041
I see.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.417
But. Hold on.
There is
good news.

06:15.834 --> 06:19.417
Our research says
there's a core
teenage audience

06:19.417 --> 06:22.208
that's really connecting
with the Boys.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.083
Especially... Stoke.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.083
Stoke.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.709
Stoke?
Stoke can't even act.

06:26.709 --> 06:28.375
He's mostly hair.
They like the hair.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.166
It's hot hair.
Mmm.

06:31.166 --> 06:34.959
So now we can focus on
what's actually working.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.041
We just need to
concentrate more
on the Boys

06:37.375 --> 06:39.667
and less on Matt and Morning.
(CHORUSING)

06:41.375 --> 06:43.000
You realize
that would massively
change the show.

06:43.333 --> 06:46.083
Everything we've got
is geared toward Matt.
Matt is the show.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.709
We'd have to throw
everything out.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.083
No, no, no.

06:50.041 --> 06:52.375
Now we're not saying
everything.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.083
ANDY: Just shift
the focus a little.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.500
Scooch it over a bit.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.625
Scooch it?

06:56.625 --> 06:57.709
Give it a scooch.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.375
It may be just
a matter of tweaks.

07:00.834 --> 07:01.917
Tweaks?

07:01.917 --> 07:03.583
And scooches.

07:09.041 --> 07:10.875
Relax. We're not
going to get caught.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.542
(SCOFFS) That's 'cause
we're not going.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.166
STOKE: Or you could
grow a pair.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.750
I'm not clear how my having
testicles stops this
from being a stupid idea.

07:16.750 --> 07:17.583
(LAUGHING)

07:18.250 --> 07:19.709
DIRECTOR:
Coach Lyman enters.

07:19.709 --> 07:21.750
Has anyone seen
the keys to my truck?

07:21.750 --> 07:23.125
What do
they look like?

07:23.125 --> 07:25.291
Uh, one of them
looks like a young
Richard Chamberlain...

07:25.291 --> 07:27.583
(ALL LAUGHING)
They look like keys.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.125
Sorry, Coach.
Haven't seen 'em.

07:29.625 --> 07:30.917
I'm losing my mind.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.417
Lyman exits.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.375
JASON: He's totally
going to find out.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.625
No way.

07:36.625 --> 07:38.709
He's gonna be away
all weekend at that
coaches' conference.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.083
He's not coming back
till Monday.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.333
KEVIN:
You're sure?

07:41.333 --> 07:42.959
STOKE: I'm telling you.
He's gone the whole time.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.166
Okay, if we're
gonna do this thing,
we gotta leave now.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.125
The pageant's over
in, like, an hour.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.500
By the time
we get there,

07:50.500 --> 07:52.625
that hotel's gonna be
filled with one winner

07:52.625 --> 07:55.333
and 49 depressed
and insecure girls.

07:55.917 --> 07:58.083
And they're all
gonna need help
with their self-esteem.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.000
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:00.000 --> 08:02.458
JASON: And it doesn't
bother you that we're just
emotional predators

08:02.458 --> 08:03.750
taking advantage
of their pain?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.000
STOKE: No.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.959
C'mon, 49 hot girls!
We're talking
pageant contestant hot.

08:08.458 --> 08:09.625
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:14.250 --> 08:15.959
This is going
to be fun.

08:15.959 --> 08:18.792
(EXHALES HEAVILY)
He just kept turning
pages and looking.

08:18.792 --> 08:19.917
Oh, no,
he was counting.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.166
I definitely
saw him counting.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.291
Ready?

08:22.291 --> 08:24.125
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
No.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.000
MATT: Hey.
You wanted to see us?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.667
Yeah. Come on in.

08:29.625 --> 08:30.667
(SIGHS)

08:35.125 --> 08:37.000
So, today was fun.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.166
Wasn't it? I thought
it was really...

08:38.166 --> 08:39.333
Good, good.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.125
It had so much...

08:41.125 --> 08:42.917
Very pleased.
Mmm.

08:42.917 --> 08:45.208
I got to see
how the audience
experiences it.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.125
That was different.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.625
(BOTH CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

08:51.625 --> 08:54.458
Right. Well,
this is a tricky episode.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.750
What with the Boys going off
on their little adventure.

08:57.750 --> 08:58.917
Yeah.

08:58.917 --> 09:02.333
I noticed it didn't leave
a lot of adventure for me.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.875
Which was weird.
Or as you say, tricky.

09:05.166 --> 09:06.208
Yeah, I know.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.333
(STUTTERING)

09:07.333 --> 09:08.500
I can see that...

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
So, what are we
going to do?

09:12.333 --> 09:13.542
About...

09:13.542 --> 09:16.208
About me not speaking
between pages 3 and 24.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.959
Really?
Is it that many?

09:17.959 --> 09:19.208
Uh-huh.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.709
Honestly,
you don't notice it
when you are there.

09:21.709 --> 09:22.792
You have
a lot of presence.

09:22.792 --> 09:24.083
Okay, how about this?

09:24.083 --> 09:26.458
What if I go on
their little adventure
with them?

09:26.959 --> 09:30.667
Well, that wouldn't
quite make sense.

09:30.667 --> 09:33.250
The whole point
is they're stealing
your truck.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.625
Also, I'm not sure
the Boys would want
to go with you.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.542
Yeah, I could see that,

09:38.875 --> 09:41.208
except,
you're making them up.

09:41.667 --> 09:44.041
You can make them
want to go with me.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.625
Look. The episode
is working.

09:46.625 --> 09:49.166
I wish you were in it more,
I really do,

09:49.166 --> 09:52.709
but I don't think
that's a reason to start
dismantling the whole thing.

09:52.709 --> 09:53.875
I agree.

09:55.792 --> 09:56.709
Okay.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.208
Yeah?

09:58.208 --> 10:01.291
You're right. It works.
Let's not screw it up.

10:02.000 --> 10:02.959
Thank you.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.709
Just promise I'm gonna be
heavy in next week's show.

10:06.917 --> 10:07.875
BOTH: Um...

10:08.875 --> 10:10.041
(BOTH HESITATING)

10:10.667 --> 10:11.917
Um...

10:11.917 --> 10:12.875
Oh, Jesus.

10:13.291 --> 10:14.625
What?

10:14.625 --> 10:15.750
I get it.

10:15.750 --> 10:16.917
What, what do you get?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.583
This is your
little revenge.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.125
For what happened
with the three of us.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.500
What?

10:21.500 --> 10:24.417
Well, that is
pretty shitty.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.709
Seriously, could you
maybe be less professional?

10:27.709 --> 10:29.875
That is not what this is!
Bullshit!

10:29.875 --> 10:31.333
It's not us!
It's coming
from the network!

10:31.333 --> 10:32.458
Oh!

10:33.500 --> 10:34.583
Oh.

10:36.792 --> 10:38.250
I really wish
it was you guys.

10:40.625 --> 10:44.625
They're trying to appeal
to a younger demographic.

10:44.625 --> 10:48.834
They want us to refocus
the show on the Boys,
and less on you and Morning.

10:56.458 --> 10:57.583
Wow.

10:58.917 --> 11:00.041
I'm sorry.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.625
Mmm, me, too.

11:02.166 --> 11:04.542
So, where are you guys?

11:04.917 --> 11:07.291
Do you want to do a show
about a bunch of hockey kids?

11:07.625 --> 11:09.750
We didn't want to do a show
about a hockey coach.

11:09.750 --> 11:13.917
They think Stoke
is a breakout star.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.208
Which one's Stoke?

11:16.125 --> 11:17.458
With the hair?

11:17.458 --> 11:20.792
(SCOFFS) It always
comes down
to the fucking hair.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.625
They have numbers
and research...

11:22.625 --> 11:24.250
Yeah, research said
Joey
was going to be a hit.

11:24.709 --> 11:25.959
Joey
was a hit.

11:25.959 --> 11:28.083
Joey
was terrific.
I mean in many ways.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.291
You, you were good,
it's just that...

11:29.291 --> 11:30.834
Especially the bits
you were in.

11:30.834 --> 11:35.625
Okay. Not to be
an asshole about it,

11:35.625 --> 11:37.166
but this is not
what I signed up for.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.875
I don't need
to get paid to watch
other people act.

11:39.875 --> 11:40.917
Totally understand.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.083
And now to be
an asshole about it,

11:43.083 --> 11:44.333
are you fucking
kidding me?

11:44.959 --> 11:48.333
I'm the only one
on this whole fucking show
anyone's ever heard of!

11:48.333 --> 11:49.375
Well, Morning...

11:49.375 --> 11:51.125
Yeah, right.
What's she done?

11:51.125 --> 11:53.583
Morning? Morning did...
Oh, she did that...

11:54.333 --> 11:56.250
This is bullshit!

11:56.250 --> 11:57.375
They want less of me?

11:57.750 --> 12:02.083
On  Pucks!?
On fucking  Pucks!?

12:02.792 --> 12:06.125
I'm not good enough
for this piece of shit
show?

12:06.583 --> 12:07.709
Your angry,
it's okay...

12:07.709 --> 12:09.792
Just let it out,
'cause otherwise...

12:09.792 --> 12:11.375
Does Merc
know about this?

12:11.375 --> 12:13.208
What do you think?
Jesus!

12:13.208 --> 12:14.375
Fuck!

12:15.083 --> 12:16.875
I'm gonna fight this.
Fine. Do it.

12:16.875 --> 12:17.875
You've got
the relationship.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.542
This is not the way
this is going down.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.709
This is not okay!

12:22.709 --> 12:23.834
(GRUNTS)

12:29.500 --> 12:30.750
(MUMBLING)

12:39.750 --> 12:40.917
Shit.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.542
Yup.
Unbelievable.

12:43.542 --> 12:44.750
Uh-huh.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.458
How can they do this?
You're Joey.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.083
Right?
And I'm Kelly.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.125
Huh?

12:50.125 --> 12:52.041
Kelly, on  Kelly Girl.

12:52.417 --> 12:53.458
Okay.

12:53.709 --> 12:56.250
I hate this
fucking business.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.250
(SIGHS)

12:59.250 --> 13:00.750
I brought
hors d'oeuvres.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.250
And you think
you don't have a problem?

13:02.750 --> 13:05.208
Who said I don't
have a problem?

13:05.208 --> 13:06.709
(LAUGHS)

13:10.458 --> 13:14.291
Where do you even get it?
Do you have, like,
a dealer or...

13:14.625 --> 13:17.291
A dealer? No.

13:17.667 --> 13:19.250
That sounds
so druggie.

13:22.542 --> 13:23.959
I have
a prescription.

13:24.291 --> 13:25.333
Why?

13:25.959 --> 13:27.208
So I don't
need a dealer.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.208
There's this doctor,
and you just have to
tell him

13:31.208 --> 13:33.083
"you're having
trouble sleeping."

13:33.083 --> 13:35.333
Are you "having trouble
sleeping"?

13:35.333 --> 13:36.417
No.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.959
Oh, I so need this today.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.458
Matt was furious.

13:42.458 --> 13:43.583
You told him?

13:45.542 --> 13:48.000
Of course we told him.
He's not stupid.

13:48.291 --> 13:52.125
Well, hopefully
he realizes it's all for
the good of the show.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.250
Oh, my God.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.458
What?

13:54.458 --> 13:55.625
You just turned
into work Carol.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.250
You always say that.
That's so not true.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.000
You should hear yourself.
Your voice changes.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
You become
brutally pleasant.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.166
Then don't fucking
talk about work.

14:05.458 --> 14:06.625
And we're back.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.125
Did you remember
to say no salami?

14:10.125 --> 14:11.834
Oh, God. Sorry.

14:11.834 --> 14:13.417
That's okay,
I'll just pick it out.

14:14.083 --> 14:17.500
Sean hates chickpeas.
Doesn't even
like to touch them.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.125
I always had to
pick them out
of his salad.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.709
That's a weird thing
to be nostalgic about.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.500
I know.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.166
So, how are things?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.792
You guys seem fine
when I'm with you.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.166
We are fine.

14:31.792 --> 14:34.000
At work
it's almost normal.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.834
We're just like
we used to be,
minus all the good bits.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.083
Aw.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.000
I miss touching him.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.000
Feeling
him hold me...

14:44.208 --> 14:45.166
It's like
with me and Merc.

14:45.458 --> 14:46.917
Not yet.
Okay.

14:49.208 --> 14:52.250
I miss talking with him.
I mean, really talking.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.166
Some days I feel like
I don't know him at all.

14:56.166 --> 14:57.542
He's on Facebook!

14:57.542 --> 14:58.667
Right.

14:59.458 --> 15:00.834
You knew this?

15:00.834 --> 15:02.875
Yeah.
We're Facebook friends.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.542
Apparently I don't know
you so well, either.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.083
Ooh, you want to
see his Facebook page?

15:16.333 --> 15:19.125
This is my page.

15:21.709 --> 15:26.709
One thousand six hundred
and forty-two friends.
You are popular.

15:26.709 --> 15:27.959
I know!

15:28.875 --> 15:30.125
Okay.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.083
Here's Sean's page.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.917
He's got 137 friends.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.458
Not so popular.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.041
(SCOFFS)

15:41.333 --> 15:42.500
What?

15:43.083 --> 15:44.166
An old
girlfriend of his.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.291
Ooh, pretty.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.375
In a fat, stupid way.

15:49.375 --> 15:51.083
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:51.750 --> 15:54.041
I didn't even know
they were in touch.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.458
What's "information"?

15:56.458 --> 15:58.291
Oh, just basic stuff.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.166
Your birthday,
where you're from,
relationship status...

16:04.625 --> 16:06.834
Seriously, let's just
turn this off.

16:06.834 --> 16:09.083
It's all right.
I want to see.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.500
I'm sure
it still says married.
Why even...

16:11.500 --> 16:13.125
(CLICKING KEYS)

16:15.625 --> 16:17.166
"It's complicated."

16:21.792 --> 16:22.959
Well,

16:24.959 --> 16:26.417
suppose it is.

16:29.291 --> 16:30.291
Morning.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.417
Hey, can I see you
for a sec?

16:36.500 --> 16:37.667
What's this?

16:37.667 --> 16:39.625
I felt bad
that I never gave you
a birthday present.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.000
Oh, I definitely
feel like you gave
me something.

16:43.834 --> 16:46.291
Well, I also
got you this.

16:46.291 --> 16:48.917
Oh, you really
didn't need to...

16:48.917 --> 16:50.834
Ah, perfect.

16:50.834 --> 16:53.000
We writers
do love our pens.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.625
Look.
I had it engraved.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.625
"Y. C. O. M. T."

16:58.625 --> 17:00.458
You Came On My Tits.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.000
(CHUCKLES)

17:05.375 --> 17:06.667
That is true.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.125
I thought it'd be tacky
to have the whole thing
written out.

17:08.125 --> 17:09.166
I think you made
the right call.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.667
Plus, they charge
by the letter, so...

17:10.667 --> 17:12.667
Ah. Frugal and filthy.

17:13.417 --> 17:14.834
Well, thank you.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.000
I figured you could use it
when you're writing
next week's script.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.125
I definitely
will do that.

17:18.125 --> 17:19.500
And hopefully
you'll think of me.

17:19.792 --> 17:21.333
How could I not?

17:21.333 --> 17:22.458
Exactly.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.417
MERC: I always forget
about this place.

17:32.709 --> 17:35.583
Didn't we come here
years ago with
Jeff Saklow from Fox?

17:35.834 --> 17:39.333
Yeah, yeah. He brought that
hooker with the boob
that kept falling out.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.041
(CHUCKLING)
Right!

17:41.041 --> 17:42.667
He ended up marrying her,
you know.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.041
Wait, that's Tracy?

17:44.041 --> 17:46.166
I guess I never
looked at her face.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.667
That's 'cause it didn't
have a nipple on it.

17:49.208 --> 17:50.583
Hey, look who's here.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.667
(SIGHS)
The penne still grt?

17:53.125 --> 17:54.542
Always.

17:54.542 --> 17:55.625
Oh, shit.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.583
Just give me
a spinach salad.

17:57.583 --> 17:59.875
No egg, no bacon,
dressing on the side.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.000
And a knife,
so I can kill myself.

18:02.792 --> 18:03.917
I'll have the penne.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.542
You prick.

18:07.959 --> 18:10.583
So talk to me.
What's going on?

18:10.583 --> 18:13.000
I don't know
if you know, but, uh,

18:13.250 --> 18:16.792
they're saying  Pucks!
needs to be more about
the kids and less about me.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.083
That's nuts!

18:18.083 --> 18:19.208
They said
it's coming from you.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.083
Well, not just me.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.500
Look, we're only trying to do
what we can to help the show.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.750
And you think less of me
will help the show?

18:29.041 --> 18:31.583
I gotta listen
to the fucking research.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.041
You don't have an opinion
of your own?

18:33.375 --> 18:34.417
Nah.

18:35.166 --> 18:36.834
Look, you know why
I did this show?

18:36.834 --> 18:38.667
'Cause I gave you
a shitload of money?

18:38.667 --> 18:41.041
No. I didn't need
to do this thing.

18:41.041 --> 18:43.583
I came back
because you asked me to.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.792
With a shitload
of money.

18:44.792 --> 18:47.834
Forget the money.
You said
you had a show for me.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.875
You asked me
as a personal favor.

18:49.875 --> 18:52.417
You said the network
needed me.

18:54.083 --> 18:57.208
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.166
I know.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.875
I hired you to be
the star of a show.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.083
It's not fair of us
to switch it up now.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.000
Thank you.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.625
The trouble is,
the show
we hired you for,

19:07.959 --> 19:09.083
it's not working.

19:10.625 --> 19:11.667
So here's a question.

19:12.917 --> 19:16.667
Do you want to be
one of the actors
on a show that's on the air

19:16.667 --> 19:19.583
or the star of something
that gets canceled?

19:30.333 --> 19:32.041
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)

19:32.500 --> 19:34.333
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

19:34.333 --> 19:36.542
Hey. I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.375
I'm quitting the show.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.166
What?

19:40.166 --> 19:42.500
I'm calling
Merc Lapenis now.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.250
I'm also gonna tell him
I'm screwing his wife.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.125
And after that?
I'm gonna tell him again.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.250
All right,
listen to me.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.375
Lapenis...
Are you listening?

19:51.709 --> 19:52.959
Yeah. What?

19:52.959 --> 19:56.291
Do not do anything
till I get there.
Where are you?

19:59.166 --> 20:02.625
Right. The phone
stays in your pocket.
Do nothing.

(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)

20:16.333 --> 20:17.333
We've got a problem.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.000
Just tell me
you haven't
called him yet.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.542
Who?
Did you call Merc?

20:33.250 --> 20:34.333
No.

20:36.208 --> 20:38.917
Put the phone away.
Put it away! Put it...

20:40.166 --> 20:42.250
This is a mistake.
You do not want to do this.

20:42.250 --> 20:43.542
Oh, I wanna do it.

20:43.542 --> 20:47.333
People do not hire people
who walk out on shows.

20:47.834 --> 20:49.083
Do you ever
want to work again?

20:49.083 --> 20:50.709
I don't care.
Listen to me.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.458
Sorry.

20:55.458 --> 20:57.834
I hate to be a douche,
but could I
get an autograph?

20:58.166 --> 20:59.625
Just huge fan.

21:00.250 --> 21:01.583
Sure thing.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.375
Sorry.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.291
What's your name?
Dennis.

21:16.583 --> 21:21.750
"Dennis, you are
not a douche."

21:21.750 --> 21:23.417
(TITTERS)

21:24.333 --> 21:26.417
There you go.
Bye-bye.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.083
Thanks, Matt.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.083
Fancy.
It was a gift from Morning.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.625
"Y. C. O. M. T."

21:37.041 --> 21:38.083
You Came On My Tits?

21:38.083 --> 21:40.250
Yes!
How did you know?

21:40.792 --> 21:41.625
What else could it be?

21:42.291 --> 21:45.250
Sorry I'm late.
I had trouble getting in.

21:45.625 --> 21:46.625
Why?

21:46.625 --> 21:48.542
Because I'm not 22.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.458
I was just trying
to tell Matt

21:51.458 --> 21:54.375
why it's a mistake
for him to leave the show.

21:54.375 --> 21:57.458
And I was saying
I don't give a shit.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.250
There,
you're all caught up.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.291
I'd love a whiskey.
Sure.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.500
Need I even ask?
Right.

22:08.792 --> 22:09.667
Come here.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.625
You can't quit.

22:20.583 --> 22:23.333
I'm too old,
I'm too rich,

22:24.333 --> 22:25.959
and I've been
doing this too long,

22:25.959 --> 22:27.709
I don't need this shit.

22:27.709 --> 22:29.208
You're right, you don't.

22:29.917 --> 22:31.041
Thank you.

22:31.041 --> 22:34.000
You realize, if you leave,
there is no show.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.083
(SARCASTICALLY)
What about the Boys?

22:36.083 --> 22:38.458
They couldn't
carry your bag,
let alone a TV series.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.166
No argument from me.

22:40.166 --> 22:43.583
Look, you don't
owe me anything.

22:43.583 --> 22:46.375
But if this thing
goes down,
we go back to London.

22:47.125 --> 22:48.166
So?

22:48.917 --> 22:51.834
If we go back now,
that's it, we're done.

22:53.291 --> 22:55.709
As long as we're here,
I still have a chance.

22:58.208 --> 22:59.709
Don't quit yet.

23:00.709 --> 23:01.667
Please.

23:04.959 --> 23:06.166
ANDREW: Bev?

23:08.542 --> 23:10.000
Andrew!

23:10.000 --> 23:12.417
Oh, my God!
How are you?

23:12.417 --> 23:13.500
Great.

23:18.083 --> 23:19.792
This is Matt LeBlanc.

23:20.125 --> 23:22.250
Andrew Lesley.
Andrew used to be our PA.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.834
Now he's a big time
screenwriter.

23:24.834 --> 23:25.750
Yeah, we've met.

23:26.458 --> 23:28.709
Oh, fuck!
Andrew!

23:28.709 --> 23:30.542
Sean! Hey.

23:31.291 --> 23:32.375
Oh.

23:32.750 --> 23:33.917
Okay.

23:34.917 --> 23:36.458
How've you been?

23:36.458 --> 23:39.792
Well, I'm positively
drowning in meetings.

23:39.792 --> 23:41.542
Aw, fatally?

23:41.917 --> 23:43.250
It's insane.

23:43.250 --> 23:44.750
It's only my first movie,

23:44.750 --> 23:48.625
and suddenly it's like
I'm the only one in town
who can write one.

23:48.625 --> 23:49.959
That is insane.

23:49.959 --> 23:52.000
ANDREW: Paramount's
over the moon.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.208
Are you
sitting down?

23:53.208 --> 23:56.750
They're letting me
direct the next one.

23:57.083 --> 23:58.291
You're directing?

23:58.291 --> 23:59.583
The next one?

23:59.583 --> 24:01.083
I know! Isn't it mad?

24:01.083 --> 24:02.583
Yes!
Yes!

24:02.583 --> 24:05.417
So how are you all?
How's the show going?

24:05.875 --> 24:06.875
No complaints.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.000
We're on the air.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.709
I know! I saw it!

24:14.583 --> 24:18.083
Well, it's very different
from what we did before.

24:18.417 --> 24:19.917
Very different.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.291
We're still
pleased with it.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.583
Aw, that's nice.

24:24.959 --> 24:26.583
I'm gonna hit him.

24:29.458 --> 24:30.792
MAN 1: Picture up.

24:30.792 --> 24:32.083
MAN 2: On a bell.

24:32.083 --> 24:33.625
(BELL RINGING)
DIRECTOR: Action.

24:35.458 --> 24:36.458
Hey, you know
what we should do?

24:37.458 --> 24:39.458
Before we bring
Coach's truck back,

24:39.458 --> 24:43.625
we should paint it
a slightly different color
and see if he notices.

24:43.959 --> 24:45.500
Repaint the truck.
Yeah.

24:46.917 --> 24:47.792
Why?

24:48.875 --> 24:50.041
It'd be funny.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.250
That's not funny.
That's just weird.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.709
Yeah. "Is it beige?
Is it ecru?"

24:55.083 --> 24:56.291
That's not a joke.

24:56.291 --> 24:57.625
What's ecru?
It's a color.

24:57.875 --> 24:59.834
Ecru's a color?
Yeah. It's like taupe.

24:59.834 --> 25:01.333
Taupe?
Taupe.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.667
How do you know this?

25:02.667 --> 25:05.875
Uh, not to stereotype,
but two gay dads.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.583
Never taught me
to throw a ball,

25:07.583 --> 25:09.250
but I do know
ecru and taupe.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.792
Hey! Less talkin',
more skatin'!

25:13.834 --> 25:15.625

DIRECTOR:
Good work today,
everyone!

25:20.792 --> 25:24.500
Uh, before anyone leaves.
Mr. LeBlanc here

25:24.500 --> 25:27.959
has been generous enough
to book the rink for us
for the rest of the day.

25:28.375 --> 25:31.250
Free skates
and hot chocolate,
whatever you want.

25:31.250 --> 25:33.125
(CAST AND CREW CHEERING)

25:38.333 --> 25:39.792
Well, see you
tomorrow.

25:39.792 --> 25:41.333
You not staying
to skate?

25:41.333 --> 25:43.333
Oh, please. Skate?

25:43.333 --> 25:44.959
Are you
forgetting Zurich?

25:44.959 --> 25:47.375
I distinctly recall
being peeled off
the ice with a spatula.

25:47.375 --> 25:49.542
Oh, come on.
Everyone's staying.

25:49.542 --> 25:54.750
I promise you there'll be no
little kamikaze Swiss children
trying to take you down.

26:11.583 --> 26:12.917
You're such a baby.

26:12.917 --> 26:14.458
I'm not a baby.

26:14.458 --> 26:19.500
I just don't understand
the appeal of trying
to balance on a floor

26:19.834 --> 26:23.375
made of ice
with two knives
strapped to my shoes,

26:23.375 --> 26:24.834
waiting to fall down.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.417
Which you know
is going to happen,

26:26.417 --> 26:27.625
at which point
I'll be thrown into the path

26:29.375 --> 26:32.208
of a bunch of people,
many of whom
don't like me,

26:32.208 --> 26:35.959
also with knives
on their shoes.

26:39.375 --> 26:40.792
You ready?

26:40.792 --> 26:42.542
Fine.
Big, big baby.

26:42.542 --> 26:45.875
All right, now let go.
Come on. I've got you.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.792
Now the other one.

There you go.

Okay. Good.

come around here.

it's okay.

Just relax.

Yeah.
