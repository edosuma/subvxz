Yeah!

00:43.641 --> 00:47.043
One, two, three.

00:47.045 --> 00:50.713
That's it, it's over, it's over.

00:50.715 --> 00:53.049
And the winner,
by a knockout,

00:53.051 --> 00:57.653
Navy Petty Officer Johnny Rudd!

00:57.655 --> 00:59.889
Chaplain Morgan.

01:08.466 --> 01:10.700
Hey, hey, hey, stay down.
You're gonna be okay.

01:10.702 --> 01:11.734
You'll be okay, all right?

01:11.736 --> 01:13.302
Oh, my God.

01:13.304 --> 01:15.004
Someone call 911!

01:15.006 --> 01:17.306
Come on.
An ambulance-- 911.

01:17.308 --> 01:18.374
Come on.
Johnny...

01:18.376 --> 01:19.842
You're gonna be okay.
You're right...

01:21.813 --> 01:23.546
Trust in the Word.

01:23.548 --> 01:24.714
What?

01:24.716 --> 01:26.916

It's the best we could do
from the vending machine

01:59.183 --> 02:00.850
in the waiting room.

02:00.852 --> 02:02.418
How you holding up, Percy?

02:02.420 --> 02:04.453
Eh, I'm good.

02:04.455 --> 02:06.389
I've been needing a break.

02:06.391 --> 02:08.157
Didn't realize
all I needed to do was

02:08.158 --> 02:10.393
be held in contempt,
and voilà...

02:10.395 --> 02:12.995
nothing but me time.

02:12.997 --> 02:15.031
Not ready to laugh
this one off just yet.

02:15.033 --> 02:17.733
Still upset?

02:17.735 --> 02:21.037
You know I'm not happy
you let Nadine Bancroft go.

02:21.039 --> 02:24.206
She's a fugitive now, but I'm
not gonna let you rot in jail.

02:24.208 --> 02:26.175
The judge is making a point
of keeping me here.

02:26.177 --> 02:27.743
He's not letting me out
anytime soon.

02:27.745 --> 02:29.578
Unless you change
your statement.

02:29.580 --> 02:30.713
Give Nadine up.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.448
That's all the judge wants.

02:32.450 --> 02:35.618
Well, we all know
that's not gonna happen.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.520
Well, it wouldn't
matter much at this point.

02:37.522 --> 02:40.156
Judge Dorsey doesn't care
about the Bancroft case.

02:40.158 --> 02:43.292
He was put up to this stunt
by Hamilton,

02:43.294 --> 02:45.261
as a message to me.

02:45.263 --> 02:48.097
Wiretapping the mayor's
phone backfired.

02:48.099 --> 02:49.598
I've been making calls.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.968
Every favor I pull,
Hamilton pulls two more.

02:52.970 --> 02:54.336
But don't worry.

02:54.338 --> 02:57.173
I'm not done fighting yet.
Excuse me.

03:00.845 --> 03:02.311
What do you got?

03:04.449 --> 03:06.315
The way he said
“don't worry”,

03:06.317 --> 03:07.583
kind of makes me worry.

03:07.585 --> 03:09.085
He's been eating himself up

03:09.087 --> 03:10.319
about your situation

03:10.321 --> 03:12.888
I'm responsible
for my situation.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.890
Neither of you
should worry.

03:14.892 --> 03:16.992
I mean, it's not like
I'm in gen pop.

03:16.994 --> 03:18.627
Segregated holding
is nothing more

03:18.629 --> 03:21.363
than daytime TV
and canned pasta.

03:21.365 --> 03:23.999
Orange just might be
your color.

03:28.172 --> 03:29.839
Christopher,
we got work.

03:29.841 --> 03:33.142
Sonja, hang in there.

03:44.589 --> 03:46.422
Paul, you're Chief
of Corrections.

03:46.424 --> 03:48.691
Your opinion's got to mean
something in this mess.

03:49.727 --> 03:51.227
No, I hear you...

03:51.229 --> 03:54.163
I appreciate that
you're trying.

03:54.165 --> 03:55.531
Yeah, talk soon.

03:55.533 --> 03:57.566
He can't help?
Already tried.

03:57.568 --> 03:59.535
Put in a word
with Justice, but..

03:59.537 --> 04:01.370
Mayor Hamilton shut him down.
Ooh, my ears.

04:01.372 --> 04:02.605
My ears are burning.

04:02.607 --> 04:03.973
Were you boys just
talking about me?

04:03.975 --> 04:05.908
What are you doing
at my crime scene?

04:05.910 --> 04:07.576
Well, I'm a bystander.

04:07.578 --> 04:08.544
I was just giving my statement.

04:08.546 --> 04:10.279
Uh, I had nothing
to do

04:10.281 --> 04:11.647
with the murder here.

04:11.649 --> 04:13.315
You got any questions,
you can call my office.

04:13.317 --> 04:15.284
It'll save you the hassle
of trying to wiretap me again.

04:15.286 --> 04:17.353
By the way, how's
Agent Percy doing?

04:19.589 --> 04:22.391
Huh? You were
in the jail tonight, right.

04:22.393 --> 04:25.794
That's why you're late, hmm?

04:25.796 --> 04:28.130
I tell you, Dwayne,
you look like

04:28.132 --> 04:30.232
you really want to
take a swing at me.

04:31.702 --> 04:33.702
Well, why don't you, then?

04:34.939 --> 04:37.473
Go ahead, huh?

04:37.475 --> 04:39.108
And you can join
Agent Percy in lockup.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.043
Go ahead.
You don't want to.

04:41.045 --> 04:42.211
Who are you?

04:42.213 --> 04:44.280
That's, uh, my new
security consultant,

04:44.282 --> 04:45.848
Mr. Stone.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.217
These are dangerous times, man.
Dangerous times.

04:48.219 --> 04:51.320
You want to come at me?
Come at me.

04:51.322 --> 04:54.690
Don't be a coward.
My team's off-limits.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.058
Nothing's off-limits, man.

04:56.060 --> 04:57.693
No.

04:57.695 --> 05:00.229
You're smart enough
to know that.

05:00.231 --> 05:01.697
Come on, King,

05:01.699 --> 05:03.933
now's not the time.

05:08.773 --> 05:10.806
Mm-mm-mm.

05:12.910 --> 05:14.577
Tell me things.

05:14.579 --> 05:16.845
Uh, victim is
Commander Henry Morgan,

05:16.847 --> 05:18.514
navy chaplain
out of Belle Chase.

05:18.516 --> 05:21.350
Judging by the stab wounds
in the lower abdomen,

05:21.352 --> 05:23.819
severe blood loss,
I'd say cause of death

05:23.821 --> 05:25.254
was multiple organ failure.

05:25.256 --> 05:27.623
And murder weapon was
a tactical knife.

05:27.625 --> 05:30.125
Morgan still had it in him
when he came into the ballroom.

05:30.127 --> 05:32.194
He was attacked off-site?

05:32.196 --> 05:34.063
Yeah, blood trail comes in
from around the corner,

05:34.065 --> 05:36.232
- lake side of the hangar.
- He was tough, though.

05:36.234 --> 05:39.134
Multiple fractures
of the metacarpal bones

05:39.136 --> 05:40.202
in both hands.

05:40.204 --> 05:41.637
He fought back.

05:41.639 --> 05:43.706
Chaplain was stabbed outside,

05:43.708 --> 05:46.075
manages to make his way inside,
looking for help.

05:46.077 --> 05:47.509
From someone specific, too.

05:47.511 --> 05:48.777
Witnesses say that he headed for

05:48.779 --> 05:50.446
a Petty Officer
Jonathan Rudd,

05:50.448 --> 05:52.715
one of the fighters tonight.
You question him?

05:52.717 --> 05:53.749
Not yet. He's upstairs.

05:53.751 --> 05:55.117
Lasalle and I will go talk

05:55.119 --> 05:57.386
to Petty Officer Rudd.

06:04.662 --> 06:06.562
Seems like it was a little
tense over there

06:06.564 --> 06:08.964
with Mayor Hamilton.
It's fine.

06:08.966 --> 06:10.833
No, I've got eyes, Dwayne.

06:10.835 --> 06:12.434
It was anything <i>but</i> fine.

06:12.436 --> 06:14.770
Loretta...

06:14.772 --> 06:16.739
I'm good.

06:25.483 --> 06:28.817
Chaplain Morgan was
trying to reach you.

06:28.819 --> 06:32.321
What'd he say
before he died?

06:32.323 --> 06:34.390
“Trust in the Word.”

06:34.392 --> 06:35.691
That's all.

06:35.693 --> 06:37.626
Trust in the Word?

06:37.628 --> 06:39.228
Anything bad,
whatever happened,

06:39.230 --> 06:40.796
he would just look at you
sort of matter-of-fact

06:40.798 --> 06:42.798
and tell you to
trust in the Word.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.767
You knew him well?

06:46.671 --> 06:49.371
He was the pastor
at Clearwater Baptist.

06:50.908 --> 06:53.042
You're from Clearwater?

06:53.878 --> 06:55.678
Chaplain was your pastor.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.080
He was more than that.
He was like a father.

06:58.082 --> 06:59.415
And not just to me.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.750
I'm guessing he taught you
how to fight.

07:01.752 --> 07:04.053
In the ring, with honor.

07:04.055 --> 07:05.654
Saved my life.

07:05.656 --> 07:07.356
I joined the navy
'cause of him.

07:07.358 --> 07:10.092
So he was a chaplain
at the naval base,

07:10.094 --> 07:12.194
and a pastor at
Clearwater Baptist?

07:12.196 --> 07:14.096
Well, Clearwater was
important to him.

07:14.098 --> 07:16.298
He felt responsible
for the community.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.667
And it got him killed.
What do you mean?

07:18.669 --> 07:21.704
He was supposed
to be here tonight,

07:21.706 --> 07:24.340
in my corner,
but he didn't show.

07:24.342 --> 07:26.241
I got a call a half
hour before the fight.

07:26.243 --> 07:29.545
He wasn't making
a lot of sense.

07:29.547 --> 07:30.713
Said that he needed help,

07:30.715 --> 07:31.880
and that there was
a new threat.

07:31.882 --> 07:34.283
We're in danger.

07:34.285 --> 07:35.751
You and him?

07:35.753 --> 07:37.786
Clearwater.

07:48.599 --> 07:50.399
King...
It's Hamilton.

07:50.401 --> 07:53.068
Mayor Hamilton's responsible
for the chaplain being killed?

07:53.070 --> 07:54.737
“A new threat
in Clearwater.”

07:54.739 --> 07:56.405
That's what Rudd said.
He did, but...

07:56.407 --> 07:58.640
Hamilton removed
police services weeks ago.

07:58.642 --> 08:00.843
Set up a slush fund
to buy up properties.

08:00.845 --> 08:02.398
Forced people out
who wouldn't sell.

08:02.422 --> 08:03.446
Okay, I hear you.

08:03.447 --> 08:05.180
I know it, Christopher,
in my bones...

08:05.182 --> 08:07.816
What would you tell me if
the roles were reversed here?

08:07.818 --> 08:10.386
You'd say work the case.

08:10.388 --> 08:12.421
See where it leads.

08:16.494 --> 08:18.694
So let's go work the case.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.633
Talk to me.

08:24.635 --> 08:25.801
Asked us to pull
everything we got

08:25.803 --> 08:27.269
on the Clearwater
investigation.

08:27.271 --> 08:28.504
We don't have much.

08:28.506 --> 08:29.905
We know Audubon Industries

08:29.907 --> 08:31.240
has been buying up
properties there.

08:31.242 --> 08:32.573
We know it's
a shell corporation

08:32.576 --> 08:34.176
with a fat off-shore
bank account.

08:34.178 --> 08:35.711
Funded with drug money
from a narcotics ring

08:35.712 --> 08:37.145
we busted last month.

08:37.148 --> 08:38.780
And we're pretty sure
Mayor Hamilton's

08:38.783 --> 08:40.816
behind it all, but we don't
have any evidence.

08:40.818 --> 08:42.985
It's there, you just
have to find it.

08:42.986 --> 08:44.686
I'm wondering what any
of this has to do

08:44.688 --> 08:45.854
with Chaplain Morgan's
killing.

08:45.856 --> 08:48.290
Pride thinks it's connected.

08:48.292 --> 08:51.393
Morgan was a community leader.

08:51.395 --> 08:54.563
Worked to keep
Clearwater intact.

08:54.565 --> 08:56.732
The mayor's working
to destroy it.

08:56.734 --> 08:59.668
Morgan found a new danger
in the neighborhood.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.069
Bit of a reach,
don't you think?

09:01.071 --> 09:03.572
No, I don't.

09:03.574 --> 09:04.840
Where are we
with Morgan's murder?

09:04.842 --> 09:06.308
No witnesses.

09:06.310 --> 09:09.111
Area where the guy
was stabbed outside

09:09.113 --> 09:10.712
is a blind spot
for security cameras.

09:10.714 --> 09:12.214
Perfect place
for an ambush.

09:12.216 --> 09:13.749
Killer knew what
he was doing.

09:13.751 --> 09:15.083
And the weapon?

09:15.085 --> 09:16.952
A combat knife,
drop point blade.

09:16.954 --> 09:19.087
Serrated edge.
Too common

09:19.089 --> 09:20.656
to trace back
to a point of sale,

09:20.658 --> 09:22.891
and no DNA or prints,
except for the victim's.

09:22.893 --> 09:24.660
So nothing.

09:24.662 --> 09:27.162
Well, I'm...
I mean, I found some

09:27.164 --> 09:28.430
trace amounts of fiberglass

09:28.432 --> 09:30.432
along the bolster
and the thumbstud.

09:30.434 --> 09:32.167
I'm still working on
a more detailed analysis.

09:32.169 --> 09:35.504
Well, we got to
dig deeper, people.

09:35.506 --> 09:37.573
Get into Chaplain
Morgan's life.

09:37.575 --> 09:39.942
Figure out any
connection to Hamilton

09:39.944 --> 09:42.144
or Audubon...
What if there isn't one?

09:43.848 --> 09:47.516
I've been monitoring
911 dispatch to Clearwater

09:47.518 --> 09:49.818
since NOPD resources
were pulled.

09:49.820 --> 09:52.688
Call just came in
outside of Clearwater Baptist.

09:52.690 --> 09:53.956
Shots fired.

09:53.958 --> 09:55.858
That's Morgan's church.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.593
Chris, Gregorio, with me.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.242
Somebody
tore this place apart.

10:15.779 --> 10:17.312
Somebody's getting
torn apart.

10:17.314 --> 10:19.781
Rudd!, Rudd, back off!

10:19.783 --> 10:21.717
Rudd! Hey.

10:21.719 --> 10:23.218
Get this guy off me.

10:23.220 --> 10:25.554
Stand down now!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:25.556 --> 10:27.256
Pride, he killed him.

10:27.258 --> 10:29.892
He killed Chaplain Morgan!
You killed him!

10:39.829 --> 10:42.162
Keep moving.
I told you to let us

10:42.164 --> 10:44.198
investigate this case-- NCIS.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.499
I wasn't investigating anything.

10:45.501 --> 10:46.900
I came in and he was here.

10:46.902 --> 10:48.635
- Who is he?
- Carlton Boone.

10:48.637 --> 10:49.603
Gang leader.

10:49.605 --> 10:50.938
Heads up the Public Enemies.

10:50.940 --> 10:52.706
Public Enemies are Lower Nine.

10:52.708 --> 10:54.208
They don't run in Clearwater.

10:54.210 --> 10:55.609
They do now.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.711
Ever since the cops
abandoned the neighborhood.

10:57.713 --> 10:59.613
Public Enemies, Ward Warriors.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.549
And what makes you so sure
Boone killed Chaplain Morgan?

11:02.551 --> 11:03.917
Some of the parishioners said

11:03.919 --> 11:05.953
they saw them arguing
yesterday morning.

11:05.955 --> 11:07.254
Right in front
of the church.

11:07.256 --> 11:09.823
That is not exactly
a smoking gun.

11:09.825 --> 11:11.325
Look at this place.

11:11.327 --> 11:13.327
Boone wrecked the church?

11:13.329 --> 11:15.028
Why?

11:15.030 --> 11:16.497
Chaplain Morgan
was the only person

11:16.499 --> 11:19.099
standing between
the neighborhood and the gangs.

11:19.101 --> 11:20.467
He stood up to them.

11:20.469 --> 11:22.369
Mostly, they respected
the pulpit.

11:22.371 --> 11:24.471
You should've
come to me with this.

11:24.473 --> 11:26.774
I came in here to set
up for a memorial.

11:26.776 --> 11:28.475
I see Boone standing in
the middle of the sanctuary,

11:28.477 --> 11:30.010
like he's proud
of the mess he made.

11:30.012 --> 11:31.311
What was I supposed to do?

11:31.313 --> 11:32.546
You weren't supposed
to beat a suspect

11:32.548 --> 11:34.148
within an inch of his life.

11:34.150 --> 11:36.049
I only wish you would've
came a few moments later,

11:36.051 --> 11:37.151
I would've finished the job.

11:37.153 --> 11:38.385
And then what?

11:38.387 --> 11:40.654
You'd be up on a murder charge.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.856
Jeopardizing my case,
your navy career...

11:42.858 --> 11:44.358
Come on, Rudd.

11:44.360 --> 11:47.194
I've known you all of ten
minutes, you're no killer.

11:47.196 --> 11:48.829
If you push a man far enough...

11:48.831 --> 11:50.631
That what Chaplain Morgan
taught you?

11:50.633 --> 11:52.633
Eye for an eye?

11:59.041 --> 12:03.143
“Trust in the Word.” Right?

12:04.814 --> 12:09.082
That's what he used to tell you.

12:09.084 --> 12:11.151
Then honor him.

12:11.153 --> 12:13.654
Get ahold of yourself.

12:13.656 --> 12:16.990
Anger'll just tear you apart.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.829
This community needs people
to hold them together.

12:21.831 --> 12:25.999
Let us deal with Boone.

12:35.277 --> 12:37.478
<i>We know you got in an argument</i>

12:37.480 --> 12:39.680
with Chaplain Morgan
the morning he died.

12:39.682 --> 12:41.281
And whatever it was,

12:41.283 --> 12:42.616
you got so worked up

12:42.618 --> 12:44.151
that you went
and wrecked his church.

12:44.153 --> 12:45.719
That wasn't me.

12:45.721 --> 12:48.322
Look, I-I went down there
to light a candle in his memory.

12:48.324 --> 12:50.157
That place was a hurricane
when I got there.

12:50.159 --> 12:52.092
What about the argument,
Carlton?

12:52.094 --> 12:54.561
Morgan was a pain
in the ass, okay?

12:54.563 --> 12:57.030
He stuck his nose
where it didn't belong.

12:57.032 --> 12:59.500
Trying to broker peace
between the Public Enemies

12:59.502 --> 13:01.034
and the Ward Warriors.

13:01.036 --> 13:02.135
You weren't interested in peace.

13:02.137 --> 13:03.370
No.

13:03.372 --> 13:05.005
But it was important
to the pastor.

13:05.007 --> 13:06.306
And he showed respect.

13:06.308 --> 13:08.709
And we showed it back.

13:08.711 --> 13:10.611
But one day,
someone stopped showing it.

13:10.613 --> 13:12.346
Couple weeks ago,

13:12.348 --> 13:14.348
one of my boys disappeared.

13:14.350 --> 13:17.851
So, wait. You thinking
the Warriors broke their truce

13:17.853 --> 13:19.086
and took one of your guys out?

13:19.088 --> 13:20.287
Yeah.

13:20.289 --> 13:21.455
Morgan had a different idea,

13:21.457 --> 13:23.857
said someone else
was responsible.

13:23.859 --> 13:25.726
Another gang.
No, not a gang.

13:25.728 --> 13:28.762
A new player, looking to take
down the whole neighborhood.

13:28.764 --> 13:32.165
Look, I thought the pastor
was just trying to stall me,

13:32.167 --> 13:33.800
but now he's dead.

13:33.802 --> 13:35.969
So maybe he was right.

13:42.311 --> 13:45.846
You heard him: new player in
Clearwater, it's Hamilton.

13:45.848 --> 13:47.814
All we know is that he's
probably buying up properties.

13:47.816 --> 13:49.383
She's right.
We need more to connect Hamilton

13:49.385 --> 13:50.817
to Morgan's death.

13:50.819 --> 13:52.386
Sebastian processed the church.

13:52.388 --> 13:54.321
I'll see what he came up with.

13:54.323 --> 13:55.455
I'll come with you.

13:55.457 --> 13:57.724
No. Follow up on
Boone's story.

13:57.726 --> 13:59.626
See if it holds water.

13:59.628 --> 14:02.496
It's like he's willing there
to be a connection to Hamilton.

14:02.498 --> 14:04.598
Yeah, can't blame him.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.333
Mayor goes after one of our own,

14:06.335 --> 14:08.335
it's hard not
to take it personal.

14:08.337 --> 14:10.037
He's not the only one.

14:10.039 --> 14:12.205
What's that supposed to mean?

14:12.207 --> 14:13.574
You and Percy are close.
She's inside,

14:13.576 --> 14:15.275
you're out, can't be easy.

14:15.277 --> 14:18.011
It's not easy for any of
us. Percy's our family.

14:18.013 --> 14:20.013
I'm no more or less worried
for her than you.

14:20.015 --> 14:21.615
All right.

14:21.617 --> 14:24.918
This is me,
minding my own business.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.987
Gregorio, for real,
I'm good.

14:26.989 --> 14:28.689
All right? Percy's
in a safe place,

14:28.691 --> 14:31.058
and we'll be getting
her out soon.

14:31.060 --> 14:34.127
Yeah. You're right.

14:41.203 --> 14:43.437
So, uh, mind telling
me where we're going?

14:43.439 --> 14:44.638
Got you a new cell.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.206
Something wrong
with the old one?

14:46.208 --> 14:48.642
Afraid that's above
my pay grade.

14:48.644 --> 14:50.477
Hey, what section of the
jail are you taking me to?

14:50.479 --> 14:51.745
C-Block.

14:51.747 --> 14:53.313
C-Block?
That's general population.

14:53.315 --> 14:54.481
Affirmative.

14:54.483 --> 14:56.950
Well, look,
there's a mistake, all right?

14:56.952 --> 14:58.352
I'm a federal agent.

14:58.354 --> 15:00.120
A cop.

15:00.122 --> 15:02.889
There's, like, a dozen people
I personally put in there.

15:02.891 --> 15:04.891
Listen, I don't take orders
from prisoners.

15:04.893 --> 15:08.395
Now you're walking through that
door, voluntarily or by force.

15:40.396 --> 15:42.095
<i>Here's what we know.</i>

15:42.097 --> 15:45.832
Chaplain Morgan was afraid
of a new threat to Clearwater,

15:45.834 --> 15:48.035
warned Rudd about it
before he was murdered.

15:48.037 --> 15:50.270
And you think that threat
is Mayor Hamilton.

15:50.272 --> 15:52.806
I do. But I still need proof.

15:52.808 --> 15:56.076
Okay. All right,
you're looking right at me.

15:56.078 --> 15:58.245
So that's,
that's a little bit of pressure.

15:58.247 --> 15:59.813
Oh, I don't think
Dwayne is putting pressure

15:59.815 --> 16:01.515
on anyone, he just wants to know
what evidence

16:01.517 --> 16:02.716
you found in the church,

16:02.718 --> 16:04.618
no matter who
that might point to.

16:07.056 --> 16:08.689
Okay. Well, great, then.

16:08.691 --> 16:10.490
Um, I can tell you
this for sure:

16:10.492 --> 16:13.460
uh, the church wasn't vandalized
so much as it was tossed.

16:13.462 --> 16:15.696
Whoever wrecked the place was
looking for something specific.

16:15.698 --> 16:17.230
Any idea what?

16:17.232 --> 16:18.498
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it was this.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.701
HD camera, shotgun mic,

16:20.703 --> 16:23.003
parabolic sound amplifier,
all top of the line,

16:23.005 --> 16:24.371
all night vision enabled.

16:24.373 --> 16:25.672
I found it
in the chaplain's office.

16:25.674 --> 16:27.107
Surveillance equipment.

16:27.109 --> 16:28.942
I don't think Morgan
was recording the choir with it.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.777
What was he recording?
Not sure.

16:30.779 --> 16:33.046
The data card's gone,
hard drive's busted,

16:33.048 --> 16:34.681
I can't recover anything.

16:34.683 --> 16:39.786
So, whoever tossed the church
probably has the data card.

16:39.788 --> 16:42.022
Means whatever's on it
was worth killing for.

16:42.024 --> 16:43.724
Well, we might
not be able to tell you

16:43.726 --> 16:45.492
what was on the data card,

16:45.494 --> 16:48.662
but we may be able to tell you
where the suspect can be found.

16:48.664 --> 16:51.131
While performing the
chaplain's autopsy,

16:51.133 --> 16:53.266
I found foreign substance
in his lungs.

16:53.268 --> 16:55.602
There's traces
of microscopic fiberglass.

16:55.604 --> 16:57.337
It matches the trace
we found on the murder weapon.

16:57.339 --> 16:58.538
Which means Morgan
and his killer

16:58.540 --> 17:01.174
were at another location
before the murder.

17:01.176 --> 17:02.082
Where?

17:02.106 --> 17:03.578
<i>New Orleans Heritage Boat Yard</i>

17:03.579 --> 17:05.645
used to be one of Clearwater's
primary employers.

17:05.646 --> 17:08.882
Lot of fiberglass was used here
before the financial crisis hit.

17:08.884 --> 17:11.084
Heritage went bankrupt,
been shuttered ever since,

17:11.086 --> 17:13.119
until the property
was purchased end of last year

17:13.122 --> 17:15.422
by Audubon Industries.

17:15.424 --> 17:19.025
So we know Chaplain Morgan
was here, his killer was.

17:19.027 --> 17:20.327
Which means
you were right, Pride.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.429
This murder is connected
to Mayor Hamilton.

17:22.431 --> 17:23.630
Still don't know how.

17:23.632 --> 17:25.265
Got fresh tire
tracks right here.

17:25.267 --> 17:27.367
Chance our answer's inside.

17:40.115 --> 17:41.948
All right. Stay sharp.

18:04.706 --> 18:06.139
Federal agent.

18:07.309 --> 18:09.476
Put the canister down slow.

18:09.478 --> 18:10.944
And then let me see those hands.

18:12.548 --> 18:14.114
Easy.

18:14.116 --> 18:16.750
Let me see them!

18:50.285 --> 18:52.152
- Pride! Pride!
- Pride!

18:52.154 --> 18:53.286
Enough!

18:53.288 --> 18:54.855
He's down.

19:34.103 --> 19:37.037
BOLO's out on the SUV
the suspects fled in.

19:37.039 --> 19:39.273
We took the windshield out,
so they can't get far.

19:39.275 --> 19:41.808
They're dumping that vehicle
first chance they get.

19:41.810 --> 19:43.844
Whatever they were
doing, they cleaned up.

19:43.846 --> 19:45.946
Place is covered in
bleach, crew was thorough.

19:45.948 --> 19:48.081
Not your typical street thugs.
The way they fight,

19:48.083 --> 19:51.084
the way they shoot,
every tactic, they're pros.

19:51.086 --> 19:52.753
You thinking ex-military?

19:52.755 --> 19:55.822
Why would Hamilton bring private
contractors into Clearwater?

19:55.824 --> 19:57.891
Well, whatever the reason,
Chaplain Morgan found out,

19:57.893 --> 20:00.594
and they killed him before
he could tell anyone else.

20:00.596 --> 20:01.728
How can you be sure?

20:01.730 --> 20:04.231
The guy I fought
had a broken nose.

20:04.233 --> 20:05.632
Courtesy of Morgan's
boxing days.

20:05.634 --> 20:07.100
Yeah. We almost had them.

20:07.102 --> 20:09.036
We got to be faster next time.

20:09.038 --> 20:10.771
Speed's not the problem, King.

20:10.773 --> 20:14.207
Fact is, I think you moved a
little too fast back there.

20:14.209 --> 20:16.543
Trying to take the suspect down
without us.

20:16.545 --> 20:18.946
It almost got yourself killed.

20:18.948 --> 20:21.214
Think I was reckless?

20:21.216 --> 20:25.352
Yeah. You could've waited
a moment for backup.

20:27.356 --> 20:31.858
I'm tired of always being
a step behind Hamilton.

20:31.860 --> 20:33.160
We need a win.

20:33.162 --> 20:34.428
And we will get it.

20:34.430 --> 20:35.562
Together.

20:35.564 --> 20:37.731
Sebastian's
on his way.

20:37.733 --> 20:39.766
Anything the suspects
left behind, he'll find it.

20:42.438 --> 20:45.339
Won't have to.

20:45.341 --> 20:47.140
I already have it.

20:49.144 --> 20:51.144
Got the killer's blood
right here.

20:51.146 --> 20:55.782
Ha. Match the DNA,
we got his identity.

21:04.126 --> 21:08.228
NCIS got to the boatyard before
we could bug out. Had to engage.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.163
So you thought
the next obvious move

21:10.165 --> 21:12.199
was setting up a meeting with me
in broad daylight, huh?

21:12.201 --> 21:14.534
No one followed me.
I was careful.

21:14.536 --> 21:16.269
Nothing you've done is careful.

21:16.271 --> 21:18.038
You killed
a navy chaplain

21:18.040 --> 21:19.606
in front of half

21:19.608 --> 21:21.008
of official
New Orleans.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.477
Clean up your mess,
finish your assignment.

21:23.479 --> 21:25.212
We're on a schedule here.

21:25.214 --> 21:30.550
Oh, and, uh, please stop
bleeding on my leather.

21:36.992 --> 21:38.859
<i>I gave your guys a lot of money</i>

21:38.861 --> 21:40.660
<i>because you told me</i>
<i>they were the best.</i>

21:40.662 --> 21:43.630
All evidence to the contrary.

21:43.632 --> 21:46.199
You said you'd handle NCIS.

21:46.201 --> 21:49.302
They're onto Audubon, which
means it's only a matter of time

21:49.304 --> 21:50.904
before they link it to you.

21:50.906 --> 21:53.640
Audubon will not be a problem.

21:53.642 --> 21:55.108
It already is.
Yeah, yeah.

21:55.110 --> 21:56.743
I-I've got that covered.

21:56.745 --> 22:00.280
You do your job, I'll do mine.

22:02.117 --> 22:04.684
State police just found
the suspects' stolen SUV,

22:04.686 --> 22:07.587
ditched off the 57 in Dulac,
charred to the frame.

22:07.589 --> 22:09.823
Last night, these guys
killed the chaplain,

22:09.825 --> 22:12.025
took the data card
from his camera

22:12.027 --> 22:13.493
and then cleaned up
whatever they were doing

22:13.495 --> 22:14.694
at that boatyard.

22:14.696 --> 22:16.229
Probably on their way
out of town.

22:16.231 --> 22:17.531
I'll head over to Dulac now

22:17.533 --> 22:19.399
to check on the SUV,
just in case.

22:24.373 --> 22:25.972
You have a collect call

22:25.974 --> 22:28.408
from an inmate at
Orleans Parish Prison.

22:28.410 --> 22:29.709
Would you like to accept?

22:29.711 --> 22:31.411
Yes.

22:31.413 --> 22:33.046
Hey, jailbird?

22:33.048 --> 22:35.449
Shouldn't you be watching
daytime TV?

22:36.785 --> 22:38.718
I'm in trouble, Lasalle.

22:38.720 --> 22:39.953
What's going on?

22:39.955 --> 22:41.855
They moved me to gen pop.

22:41.857 --> 22:43.523
What? When?

22:43.525 --> 22:44.791
This morning.

22:44.793 --> 22:46.526
They wouldn't let me
use the phone until just now.

22:46.528 --> 22:49.496
It's no secret that I'm a fed.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.364
There're people here who want
to do me some serious harm.

22:51.366 --> 22:52.866
Yeah, and somebody
pulled some strings

22:52.868 --> 22:54.768
to get you locked up
right there with 'em.

22:54.770 --> 22:56.136
Yeah, I'm screwed.

22:56.138 --> 22:58.438
We're gonna get you out
of there, Percy.

22:58.440 --> 22:59.606
I promise.

22:59.608 --> 23:00.774
It's got to be soon.

23:00.776 --> 23:02.976
I'm on borrowed time.

23:02.978 --> 23:04.878
We're gonna do
everything we can.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.713
And I need you
to get yourself safe

23:06.715 --> 23:07.814
until we do.

23:07.816 --> 23:09.316
You listening?

23:09.318 --> 23:10.851
Yeah.

23:10.853 --> 23:12.819
Do whatever it takes
to get yourself safe, Percy.

23:12.821 --> 23:15.789
Anything.

23:45.454 --> 23:47.254
Get her up!

23:47.256 --> 23:49.556
Put her in the hole. Now!
Let's go.

23:55.364 --> 23:57.931
All right, Chris. But ju...

23:57.933 --> 24:00.000
Let me know as soon as you
find out anything new.

24:00.002 --> 24:01.968
You know I will.

24:01.970 --> 24:03.470
Damn it.

24:03.472 --> 24:05.772
Hamilton had Sonja transferred
to general population.

24:05.774 --> 24:07.040
Is Sonja all right?

24:07.042 --> 24:08.808
She jumped a guard.
Got herself...

24:08.810 --> 24:11.244
put into solitary.
She's safe for now.

24:11.246 --> 24:12.712
Okay. Then please sit back down.

24:12.714 --> 24:14.347
I'm not done taking samples.

24:14.349 --> 24:17.651
I need to go.
Break Sonja out?

24:17.653 --> 24:18.952
I'm going to City Hall.

24:18.954 --> 24:21.521
Ah, to give Hamilton
a piece of your mind.

24:21.523 --> 24:24.291
How did that that work
out for you in the past?

24:24.293 --> 24:26.693
Dwayne, you want to help Sonja?

24:26.695 --> 24:29.663
If you want to stop Hamilton,
then let's identify

24:29.665 --> 24:32.832
Chaplain Morgan's killer.

24:32.834 --> 24:35.035
Please sit down.

24:44.279 --> 24:46.146
Lasalle and Gregorio
think I'm being reckless.

24:46.148 --> 24:47.647
I'm guessing you agree?

24:47.649 --> 24:50.183
You carry the weight of the city
on your shoulders.

24:50.185 --> 24:53.420
It's not uncommon to stumble
from time to time.

24:53.422 --> 24:56.256
Hamilton's threatening
the safety of my team.

24:56.258 --> 24:58.391
'Cause we're getting close
to him.

24:58.393 --> 25:00.060
But I swear, I...

25:00.062 --> 25:01.206
I've got everything
under con...

25:01.230 --> 25:03.030
Control. Dwayne.

25:03.031 --> 25:05.765
This situation
hasn't been under control

25:05.767 --> 25:07.100
for a long time.

25:07.102 --> 25:10.270
Sonja isn't the first casualty.

25:10.272 --> 25:13.907
Rita just barely survived
being run off the road.

25:13.909 --> 25:15.342
This isn't about Rita.

25:15.344 --> 25:17.444
It's about you losing sight
of who you are.

25:17.446 --> 25:18.578
What you do.

25:18.580 --> 25:21.114
How can you take care
of your team--

25:21.116 --> 25:23.083
or yourself--

25:23.085 --> 25:25.418
if you're blinded by rage?

25:33.295 --> 25:35.295
Is that more news of Sonja?

25:35.297 --> 25:38.932
No. It's about the case.

25:38.934 --> 25:40.767
I need to go, if...

25:40.769 --> 25:43.169
Yes. Go.

25:49.378 --> 25:52.345
<i>From the moment</i>

25:52.347 --> 25:53.813
I left the base this afternoon,

25:53.815 --> 25:55.081
these guys were on my six.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.316
Gray van.

25:56.318 --> 25:58.652
Tinted windows.
They were following you?

25:58.654 --> 25:59.886
More than that.

25:59.888 --> 26:01.655
I get to Clearwater,
they get aggressive.

26:01.657 --> 26:03.423
Cut me off.

26:03.425 --> 26:05.925
They tried to ambush me.
I got out of the car and ran.

26:05.927 --> 26:07.294
Did you see
what they looked like?

26:07.296 --> 26:08.561
Military fit.

26:08.563 --> 26:09.763
And fast.

26:09.765 --> 26:11.765
Slipped into an old cargo depot
by the river.

26:11.767 --> 26:13.199
Just barely lost 'em

26:13.201 --> 26:14.567
in the maze of containers.

26:14.569 --> 26:16.202
Came here.
Did the right thing.

26:16.204 --> 26:17.671
Morgan caught those
guys on camera

26:17.673 --> 26:19.105
doing something wrong
and they killed him.

26:19.107 --> 26:20.607
They stole
the camera's data card.

26:20.609 --> 26:23.777
Why come after me
if they have what they want?

26:23.779 --> 26:25.578
Because
I'm pretty sure that they don't.

26:25.580 --> 26:28.114
I just did some digital surgery
on Morgan's busted camera.

26:28.116 --> 26:30.717
I learned that the data card was
ejected an hour before he died.

26:30.719 --> 26:33.687
Means it's possible
his killers still don't have it.

26:33.689 --> 26:34.256
And they think I do.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.890
They must, if they're willing

26:35.891 --> 26:37.023
to go after you
in broad daylight,

26:37.025 --> 26:38.391
knowing we're on their tails.

26:38.393 --> 26:40.360
Well, it only confirms
that whatever's on the card

26:40.362 --> 26:42.128
is highly sensitive.

26:42.130 --> 26:43.997
I have no idea
where this card is.

26:43.999 --> 26:45.732
Hate to crash your party,

26:45.734 --> 26:48.702
but Triple P is about to serve
you up a sizzling hot lead.

26:48.704 --> 26:50.203
Gregorio, stick
with Petty Officer Rudd here.

26:50.205 --> 26:52.505
See if you two can't figure out
where that data card might be.

26:52.507 --> 26:53.740
What do you got, P?

26:53.742 --> 26:55.508
Sebastian was running
some of the blood samples

26:55.510 --> 26:56.943
we got off of your knuckles.

26:56.945 --> 26:59.379
And none of the national
DNA databases had a match.

26:59.381 --> 27:01.214
Which is when he tagged me in.

27:01.216 --> 27:02.582
I may have access

27:02.584 --> 27:04.651
to some restricted
international databases.

27:05.887 --> 27:07.620
That's our guy.

27:07.622 --> 27:09.889
- He's the chaplain's killer.
- Ansel Warshak.

27:09.891 --> 27:12.726
Former Israeli Special Forces
and former Mossad.

27:12.728 --> 27:14.828
And now he's
a freelance operative.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.363
Any idea who's paying him?

27:16.365 --> 27:19.032
Oh, this is the best part.

27:19.034 --> 27:21.101
Audubon Industries.

27:21.103 --> 27:22.802
Okay.

27:22.804 --> 27:25.872
So Warshak had two associates.

27:25.874 --> 27:27.374
We need their names
and their locations.

27:27.376 --> 27:28.541
Can you do that?

27:28.543 --> 27:29.809
Oh, ask and you shall receive.

27:29.811 --> 27:31.678
Patton Plame.

27:31.680 --> 27:32.679
I'm going to need you

27:32.681 --> 27:34.547
to take your hands
off that keyboard.

27:34.549 --> 27:35.749
What's going on, Karen?

27:35.751 --> 27:37.083
We have reason to believe

27:37.085 --> 27:38.351
that your computer specialist

27:38.353 --> 27:41.388
has been involved in committing
federal cybercrime.

27:41.390 --> 27:43.757
Mr. Plame,

27:43.759 --> 27:44.924
surrender your tablet

27:44.926 --> 27:47.293
or I will place
you under arrest.

28:03.206 --> 28:05.566
Hey, yo,
easy with my hardware, man.

28:05.567 --> 28:07.567
This is some
expensive equipment.

28:07.568 --> 28:09.302
Mr. Plame,
go into the other room.

28:09.304 --> 28:11.270
Don't interfere
with our investigation.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.738
Just comply with her, Patton.

28:12.740 --> 28:14.340
All right? I'll sort this out.

28:20.181 --> 28:22.281
Don't give me
“the look,” Dwayne.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.483
I'm just doing my job here.

28:24.485 --> 28:28.054
We have hard evidence to suggest
that Mr. Plame was involved

28:28.056 --> 28:31.123
in an online horse
racing scam last year.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.125
And that evidence pertains

28:33.127 --> 28:34.527
to an undercover sting operation

28:34.529 --> 28:35.861
that my team executed

28:35.863 --> 28:37.163
to take down Javier Garcia.

28:37.165 --> 28:39.799
Official NCIS business.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.735
Official NCIS business
leaves a paper trail, Dwayne.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.739
Tag the servers.
Take them, too.

28:50.511 --> 28:53.145
How'd you find out?

28:53.147 --> 28:55.881
Excuse me?

28:55.883 --> 28:58.451
You're right.

28:58.453 --> 29:01.721
There is no paper trail
on our sting operation.

29:01.723 --> 29:03.322
The target is dead.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.358
So how'd you find out?

29:05.360 --> 29:06.959
Confidential informant.

29:06.961 --> 29:10.463
We both know it's Hamilton.

29:10.465 --> 29:12.465
He helped with the sting.

29:12.467 --> 29:15.067
He's just using you

29:15.069 --> 29:17.203
to try and...
and chip away at me,

29:17.205 --> 29:18.337
and you're letting him.

29:18.339 --> 29:19.638
This isn't personal.

29:19.640 --> 29:22.308
The hell it isn't.

29:22.310 --> 29:23.943
Mr. Plame,

29:23.945 --> 29:27.079
my agent is gonna escort you
off the premises.

29:27.081 --> 29:28.881
You are to refrain
from all contact

29:28.883 --> 29:32.184
with NCIS and any other
federal agencies.

29:32.186 --> 29:33.552
Furthermore, you're forbidden

29:33.554 --> 29:36.022
to use any Web-connected
digital device

29:36.024 --> 29:37.656
until our investigation

29:37.658 --> 29:39.125
is complete.

29:39.127 --> 29:40.526
Do you understand?
How's it feel

29:40.528 --> 29:43.396
to be the mayor's
damn errand girl?

29:45.066 --> 29:46.899
You did not just say that.

29:46.901 --> 29:49.802
First you put Sonja behind bars.
Now Patton?

29:49.804 --> 29:52.238
Percy put herself behind bars.
I don't have a choice, Dwayne...

29:52.240 --> 29:53.439
Yes, you do.

29:53.441 --> 29:55.274
You're just making
the wrong one.

29:56.144 --> 29:59.712
I'm the Assistant U.S. Attorney.

29:59.714 --> 30:02.081
I have a boss to answer to.

30:02.083 --> 30:03.816
Don't want to arrest you
for obstruction,

30:03.818 --> 30:05.885
but I will if I have to.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.219
Pride...

30:07.221 --> 30:08.821
It's cool, man.

30:08.823 --> 30:11.424
I'm going.
You got a case to solve.

30:11.426 --> 30:13.092
Hey.

30:13.094 --> 30:15.428
I'll make this right.

30:15.430 --> 30:17.196
Just keep to the terms.

30:17.198 --> 30:20.566
No computers
till I get this figured.

30:21.436 --> 30:25.738
Whatever you say, man.

30:47.195 --> 30:49.929
I have a very unusual
heat in my stomach.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.730
I-It's not, uh, food poisoning.

30:51.732 --> 30:53.566
It's not gas.

30:53.568 --> 30:54.533
It's... it's harder, you know?

30:54.535 --> 30:56.068
You want to break
somebody's face.

30:56.070 --> 30:57.303
I really do, yeah.

30:57.305 --> 30:58.637
We can't let Hamilton

30:58.639 --> 31:00.606
keep getting away
with this crap.

31:00.608 --> 31:02.975
We won't, Christopher.

31:02.977 --> 31:05.511
You ready to go to war
with the mayor,

31:05.513 --> 31:06.846
we got your back.

31:06.848 --> 31:09.014
I know you do.

31:09.016 --> 31:10.749
But we...

31:10.751 --> 31:14.453
We'll need our wits
to get this done.

31:14.455 --> 31:18.124
Look, I spent a lot of time
telling Petty Officer Rudd

31:18.126 --> 31:21.994
not to waste his energy
on anger.

31:21.996 --> 31:24.130
It's time I took my own advice.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.798
There's got to be a reason
Hamilton's coming at us

31:25.800 --> 31:27.266
so strong.

31:27.268 --> 31:29.301
'Cause we're close
to taking him down.

31:29.303 --> 31:30.569
The data card.

31:30.571 --> 31:32.271
Yes.
Right now,

31:32.273 --> 31:33.772
only way to turn
this thing around

31:33.774 --> 31:35.574
is to work the case.

31:35.576 --> 31:37.309
Get the data card,
find those suspects.

31:37.311 --> 31:39.545
They lead us to Hamilton.

31:39.547 --> 31:40.813
Where's Rudd?

31:40.815 --> 31:42.882
Up in the conference room.
Okay.

31:42.884 --> 31:45.117
You and Sebastian, try to pick
up where Patton left off,

31:45.119 --> 31:46.418
get IDs
on the other suspects.

31:46.420 --> 31:48.587
Christopher, with me.

31:50.224 --> 31:52.725
Last night,
around the time Morgan

31:52.727 --> 31:55.294
ejected the data card
from the camera,

31:55.296 --> 31:56.462
he called you
on your cell.

31:56.464 --> 31:57.830
It was right
before the fight.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.165
Called and said that
he was running late,

31:59.167 --> 32:00.733
but that he
wanted to talk.

32:00.735 --> 32:02.935
And he never mentioned
the camera or the data card?

32:02.937 --> 32:04.670
Not a word.
You remember

32:04.672 --> 32:06.005
anything else
about the call?

32:06.007 --> 32:07.873
Nothing I haven't
told you already.

32:07.875 --> 32:10.276
Look, I called him back. I asked
him why he was gonna be late.

32:10.278 --> 32:11.677
He said he was stuck
at the church.

32:11.679 --> 32:12.978
At Clearwater Baptist?

32:12.980 --> 32:14.947
He called from
the sanctuary.

32:14.949 --> 32:16.882
Which was... weird.

32:16.884 --> 32:19.018
Because Chaplain Morgan
never allowed phones

32:19.020 --> 32:20.686
in the sanctuary.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.988
There's a chance that's where
he hid the data card.

32:22.990 --> 32:25.024
Suspects turned the place
upside down.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.759
We ran through it
with a fine-tooth comb.

32:26.761 --> 32:28.093
Worth another look.

32:28.095 --> 32:30.296
Let's go sweep
the church again. Come on.

32:38.639 --> 32:39.972
What do you think you're doing?

32:41.275 --> 32:42.875
Pride called you, right?

32:42.877 --> 32:44.276
Told you about
my little suspension.

32:44.278 --> 32:45.778
No computer, no Internet,

32:45.780 --> 32:47.079
no security clearance.

32:47.081 --> 32:48.681
You're making it
sound so dramatic.

32:48.683 --> 32:50.683
Go home, Doc. You
didn't see anything.

32:50.685 --> 32:53.385
Do you have any idea what
you're getting yourself into?

32:53.387 --> 32:56.021
I'm in the middle tracking
the killers on the Morgan case.

32:56.023 --> 32:57.456
I can't leave it half done.

32:57.458 --> 32:58.924
Let Sebastian finish.

32:58.926 --> 33:01.961
I love Sebastian
like a tall, wiry,

33:01.963 --> 33:04.797
annoying younger brother,
but he can't do what I do.

33:04.799 --> 33:07.032
Patton, the stakes
are high here.

33:07.034 --> 33:11.036
We catch the killer, Pride has
a chance to bring down Hamilton.

33:11.038 --> 33:13.973
You touch that computer,
the FBI won't care.

33:13.975 --> 33:16.108
Is this worth
risking your career over?

33:16.110 --> 33:17.843
For Pride? Of course.

33:17.845 --> 33:19.878
The man stood by me
when no one else would.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.947
He didn't care
about how it looked.

33:21.949 --> 33:23.315
Or his career.

33:23.317 --> 33:24.650
He just helped me.

33:24.652 --> 33:26.819
So, please, Doc,

33:26.821 --> 33:28.821
with all
the respect I have,

33:28.823 --> 33:31.657
let me do my damn job.

33:35.963 --> 33:38.030
Damn it.

33:55.016 --> 33:57.383
Aah!

33:57.385 --> 33:58.617
You all right, Chris?

33:58.619 --> 34:00.619
Aw, just my hand.

34:02.356 --> 34:05.724
No, I mean,
you all right?

34:05.726 --> 34:07.760
I'm frustrated.

34:07.762 --> 34:10.862
Seems like searching this
place is a waste of time.

34:10.864 --> 34:13.165
Especially with Sonja
still in danger.

34:13.167 --> 34:15.367
I know you did everything
you could for her, King.

34:15.369 --> 34:16.635
It's been rough--

34:16.637 --> 34:19.138
staying focused.
In control.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.507
But we can't let Hamilton
distract us.

34:21.509 --> 34:24.143
We got to have faith
we're gonna get Sonja out.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.944
Bring Patton back.

34:25.946 --> 34:27.313
Trust in the Word, right?

34:27.315 --> 34:29.982
That's right.

34:32.119 --> 34:33.319
Rudd.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.621
“Trust in the Word.”

34:36.623 --> 34:38.891
That's what Morgan said
before he died.

34:38.893 --> 34:41.327
Yeah, he said it all the time.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.995
But he was trying
to get to you, specifically,

34:42.996 --> 34:44.228
in that ballroom.

34:44.231 --> 34:46.532
What are you thinking, Pride?

34:47.568 --> 34:49.768
The Bible.

34:51.138 --> 34:53.572
If he, uh...
if he left anything

34:53.574 --> 34:55.574
in those pages, they would
have found it already.

34:55.576 --> 34:58.444
Yeah, you're right.

35:05.219 --> 35:07.486
And the truth will be revealed.

35:07.488 --> 35:10.622
Yeah. We need to get this back
to the squad room. Let's go.

35:10.624 --> 35:12.691
Hello?

35:12.693 --> 35:14.660
Got to resist the urge
to hang up.

35:14.662 --> 35:16.462
This is too important.
Patton?!

35:16.464 --> 35:19.098
FBI gets word of this, we lose
any shot at getting you back.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.166
That is the least of your
concerns if you don't listen.

35:21.168 --> 35:23.268
I was able to hack
Ansel Warshak's cell phone,

35:23.270 --> 35:24.703
download his correspondence.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.271
You ID'd their
associates?

35:26.273 --> 35:28.340
I did, but listen,
I'm tracking his GPS,

35:28.342 --> 35:30.309
pinged his location.
Okay, where are they?

35:30.311 --> 35:32.344
At your doorstep.
They're closing in

35:32.346 --> 35:34.380
on the church, Dwayne.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.081
Get down!

35:37.284 --> 35:38.884
Hang up and call NOPD, Loretta.

35:38.886 --> 35:40.886
We need backup, fast.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.090
How did they
find us?

35:45.092 --> 35:47.326
Must've picked up your
trail after you lost 'em,

35:47.328 --> 35:48.394
tracked us here.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.730
They're looking
for this data card.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.031
We can't let
'em have it.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.499
Ain't gonna last long

36:09.501 --> 36:13.036
against night vision goggles
and submachine guns.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.539
Yeah, by the time backup gets
here they'll find us dead.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.773
Any bright ideas?

36:19.345 --> 36:20.677
Church got a
storm generator?

36:20.679 --> 36:22.479
Yeah, in the rear storage room.
All right.

36:22.481 --> 36:25.482
Stay low and get to it.
When you hear my signal,

36:25.484 --> 36:27.017
throw the switch.
What's the signal?

36:27.019 --> 36:28.352
Haven't figured
that out yet.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.586
You'll know it
when you hear it.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.288
Okay.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.028
Gonna need a
distraction.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.063
You got it.

36:40.065 --> 36:42.032
You sure you know
what you're doing here?

36:42.034 --> 36:44.301
Making it up as I go along.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.262
Hands in the air!

37:20.139 --> 37:21.638
Aah!

37:33.519 --> 37:35.652
Christopher, all clear?

37:35.654 --> 37:37.788
All clear.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.794
You did good, Rudd.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.066
You did good.

37:53.872 --> 37:57.874
This is apparently what cost
Chaplain Morgan his life.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.609
That's the Heritage
Boat Yard.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.812
Footage is time-stamped
the night of Morgan's murder.

38:01.814 --> 38:05.115
It's Thursday night.
I've been tracking this crew.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.050
I followed them here
hoping to figure out

38:07.052 --> 38:08.919
what they're doing
in Clearwater.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.055
I'm trying to hear
what they're talking about.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.523
I'm gonna get closer.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.964
Gentlemen, you're here
because...

38:20.966 --> 38:22.199
You recognize
any of them?

38:22.201 --> 38:23.667
Hard to say.
Doesn't look like

38:23.669 --> 38:26.236
the suspects
we took out at the church.

38:26.238 --> 38:28.438
The target arrives
in New Orleans

38:28.440 --> 38:30.340
in approximately 48 hours
under heavy security detail.

38:30.342 --> 38:32.042
Memorize your entry
and exit points...

38:32.044 --> 38:34.578
Sounds like they're
talking about some kind of hit.

38:34.580 --> 38:35.579
...know your contingencies.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.047
We can afford zero exposure.

38:37.049 --> 38:38.548
Understood?

38:39.985 --> 38:42.185
What was that?

38:49.128 --> 38:50.560
Rewind that.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.933
What was that?

39:01.206 --> 39:03.373
Freeze it.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.547
You know him.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.282
Yeah, we do.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.152
Mr. Stone,

39:15.154 --> 39:16.953
Hamilton's guy.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.022
Mayor's targeted our team.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.892
Maybe it's time
we come after his.

39:26.732 --> 39:30.300
Romans 14:7
teaches...

39:32.671 --> 39:35.005
“For none of us lives

39:35.007 --> 39:37.841
“to himself,

39:37.843 --> 39:40.310
and none of us
dies to himself.”

39:43.148 --> 39:44.614
“For if we live,

39:44.616 --> 39:47.918
“we live to the Lord.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.286
“And if we die,

39:49.288 --> 39:51.454
we die to the Lord.”

39:51.456 --> 39:53.490
See, Pastor Morgan--

39:53.492 --> 39:56.326
he served the Lord.

39:56.328 --> 39:57.827
