01:16.452 --> 01:18.663
Welcome to the World Science Symposium.

01:18.746 --> 01:22.833
Gotham University is honored
to host this distinguished gathering.

01:22.917 --> 01:26.045
Here, the greatest minds in science
will discuss

01:26.128 --> 01:29.590
and exchange exciting
new ideas in technology.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.138
<i>You think these ideas are new?</i>

01:36.222 --> 01:37.556
<i>Forget it, man.</i>

01:42.979 --> 01:44.855
It's the same old story.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.691
We're a push-button-society.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.778
Technology makes our heads soft,
our bodies weak.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.655
But I've got a new idea.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.283
Blow it up! Blow it all up!

02:00.746 --> 02:02.623
Then how would we
make cappuccino?

02:09.422 --> 02:11.549
We're slaves to the machine, Batman.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.676
Someone's got to stop the madness.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.767
And you appointed yourself? Great.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.357
It's the only sane solution.

02:28.441 --> 02:29.567
Yeah, right.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.760
I hate to burst your bubble, Stan.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.664
But you're not playing
with a full set of chips.

02:40.745 --> 02:42.038
Oh, yeah?

02:55.468 --> 02:56.594
Later, Batman.

03:19.492 --> 03:21.660
Ugh. Geek fest.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.873
Do you really think
Dr. Selig will show up?

03:25.956 --> 03:28.036
The world's leading scientists
have all been invited.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.378
No, this way.

03:30.461 --> 03:33.130
What? You've been in Gotham before?

03:33.214 --> 03:35.383
Yes, and maybe we'll
run into an old friend of mine.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.009
- Who?
- Batman.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.303
Yeah, right.

03:41.764 --> 03:42.598
Whoa.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.725
For a robot, you got some connections.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.235
Your hunch was right, sir.
There they are.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.153
Hold your fire until I give the signal.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.741
Now!

04:00.825 --> 04:02.576
- What?
- Run!

04:04.078 --> 04:05.079
Go!

04:24.306 --> 04:26.267
Halt! Federal agents.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.147
Lousy Feds.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.779
Hit him.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.450
Aah!

04:45.828 --> 04:47.121
Let's bring him in.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.998
Back off, man!

04:56.255 --> 04:58.132
You think I'm gonna
let you stinking Feds

04:58.215 --> 05:00.593
trample his basic human rights?

05:00.676 --> 05:03.012
Wait, it's not what you think. Listen.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.222
Big government, big lies.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.307
Forget it, man!

05:10.853 --> 05:11.854
Power to the people!

05:16.317 --> 05:17.401
Oh, no.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.420
Daddy's home!

05:38.506 --> 05:40.299
How's my little Boom-Boom?

05:42.301 --> 05:45.429
Him? Just another victim
of an uncaring society.

05:49.767 --> 05:50.767
Huh?

06:08.118 --> 06:10.704
It's a scam, man. A conspiracy.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.122
I knew they're out to get me.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.627
But I'll outsmart them.
I'll outsmart them all.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.923
911, Emergency Services.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.567
<i>You have to help me,
you have to help right away.</i>

06:22.591 --> 06:24.009
<i>- There's a problem...</i>
- Whoa.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.213
<i>- I need Batman.</i>
- Slow down.

06:25.261 --> 06:27.429
You want who? Batman?

06:27.513 --> 06:29.056
<i>Kid, this is an emergency number.</i>

06:29.139 --> 06:30.599
But this is an emergency.

06:30.683 --> 06:33.143
<i>- What kind?</i>
- Big, really big.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.562
I saw the Royal Flush Gang.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.245
Yeah, and they were trashing City Hall
along with Inque and Blight

06:37.314 --> 06:38.732
<i>and a gazillion Jokerz and then...</i>

06:38.816 --> 06:41.819
Listen, kid, filing a false report
is against the law.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.502
<i>You don't wanna
get into trouble, do you?</i>

06:43.529 --> 06:46.740
<i>I'm already in trouble.
I need Batman.</i>

06:47.199 --> 06:50.703
Come on, you got him
in a closet there, don't ya?

06:50.869 --> 06:52.037
Twip.

06:52.121 --> 06:55.124
Hey, check out the new girl.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.209
I'll bet she's got
lots of spare creds for us.

06:57.293 --> 06:58.335
Right, guys?

06:58.419 --> 06:59.795
Yeah.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.301
Ugh.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.400
Perfect. Get lost, clowns!

07:21.483 --> 07:23.777
Not "clowns." Jokerz.

07:23.861 --> 07:24.861
Whatever!

07:26.113 --> 07:28.449
Not so fast, blondie.
You haven't heard the punch line.

07:28.532 --> 07:29.700
Allow me.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.577
Ow! Not funny.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.660
Come here. Come here.

07:45.799 --> 07:46.967
Noogie time.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.313
Ow.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.733
Beat it, Chuckles.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.655
- You wanted to see me?
- We have a mutual friend.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.782
- His name is Zeta.
- Zeta!

08:09.865 --> 08:11.241
How did you get mixed up with him?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.619
Long story.
The point is, he's in trouble.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.829
We were running from the Feds
and we got split up.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.415
Zeta was picked up
by some muscle-bound gorilla

08:18.499 --> 08:19.958
with a thing for explosives.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.168
Mad Stan!

08:35.724 --> 08:36.892
Oh, dear!

08:38.018 --> 08:40.437
Out of the way, man. I'm in a hurry!

08:44.942 --> 08:46.068
Road-hog.

08:59.832 --> 09:02.584
- What happened?
- The Feds, man. They almost grabbed you.

09:02.668 --> 09:05.713
- And you saved me?
- Just fighting the power, man.

09:05.796 --> 09:06.922
- Where's R0?
- Who?

09:07.005 --> 09:08.173
My friend, who was with me.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.967
Uh... He's safe.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.470
- Ro's a girl.
- Right, right.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.596
I mean she's safe.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.306
She's hiding out from the Feds.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.100
- Where?
- Here's the address.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.397
I gotta split, man.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.149
Make sure no one follows you.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.984
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.574
Nice man.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.077
But he should drive more carefully.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.990
According to my computer,
that boat is registered

09:57.014 --> 09:59.391
under one of Stan's 200 known aliases.

09:59.475 --> 10:00.934
So, let's nail the creep.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.538
Which one of these things is the door?

10:05.355 --> 10:06.774
I'll go. You're staying here.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.193
- But-
- Don't make me lock you in.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.445
And just what am I
supposed to do while you're gone?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.659
Enjoy.

10:18.827 --> 10:19.953
Thanks heaps.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.405
Wayne, Ijust had a brush
with Stan's security system.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.493
He should be out here chucking grenades.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.704
<i>Stay sharp, he may have
something worse up his sleeve.</i>

11:13.298 --> 11:15.634
No bombs.
You sure this is the right place?

11:19.388 --> 11:20.388
Aah!

11:20.472 --> 11:22.015
I told you to wait in the car.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.451
There was nothing good on the radio.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.352
Okay, but be quiet.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.979
Mad Stan is serious trouble.

11:40.576 --> 11:42.119
Good morning, Mary Sunshine.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.706
Stan!

11:54.756 --> 11:55.924
What's in there?

11:56.008 --> 11:57.968
A sedative. A strong one.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.595
He's out for a day at least.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.013
This looks amazingly bad.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.558
Ew. A barking rat.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.935
That's Boom-Boom.
Stan's early warning system.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.982
What you got there, killer?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.150
I bet this is for me.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.655
<i>- Yo, Batman!</i>
- I hate being right.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.157
<i>The killer robot?</i>

12:20.449 --> 12:22.284
<i>Uh-uh. Too easy, man.</i>

12:22.409 --> 12:23.952
<i>Saw through him right away.</i>

12:24.036 --> 12:26.622
<i>I could have trashed wind-up boy,
but then I figured</i>

12:26.705 --> 12:29.583
<i>I'd use him to teach you
and the stinking Feds a lesson.</i>

12:29.666 --> 12:32.586
<i>I've sent your toy out
with a special delivery.</i>

12:32.669 --> 12:35.964
<i>You wanna find him?
You've got until midnight.</i>

12:36.131 --> 12:39.718
<i>As for me,
I'm taking a little trip to REM-ville.</i>

12:41.053 --> 12:43.347
<i>And I ain't waking up till it's over.</i>

12:43.430 --> 12:46.266
<i>So why are you still wasting time
watching this?</i>

12:46.350 --> 12:47.893
<i>Ticky-tock, man.</i>

12:47.976 --> 12:49.061
<i>Ticky-to ck.</i>

13:06.370 --> 13:09.414
It's a big city. So many people.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.416
And Zeta could be any one of them.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.877
I'm gonna need help. Expert help.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.130
- Wait! What if Zee contacts me?
- Here.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.927
Now you won't have to punch out Jokerz
to get my attention.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.513
Sure. Spoil my fun.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.959
Stay sharp.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.465
- What do you want?
- Zeta. I need to find him fast.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.926
The line forms behind me, wacko.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.346
You wanna talk about wackos?
Let's start with Mad Stan.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.016
He put our robot pal on the streets
with a ticking bomb.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.852
If we don't find him,
a chunk of this city goes boom.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.146
So the robot goes boom, too.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.623
That makes my life a whole lot easier.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.482
And what about the people?

14:17.566 --> 14:19.484
That's your department, hero.

14:23.321 --> 14:24.489
Hey!

14:27.826 --> 14:29.703
You get the tracer on that thing?

14:29.786 --> 14:30.871
No problem.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.165
With any luck,
he'll lead us right to Zeta.

14:48.346 --> 14:49.723
<i>Batman, any luck yet?</i>

14:49.806 --> 14:51.266
I alerted Agent Bennett, but...

14:51.349 --> 14:52.934
Bennett, how could you?

14:53.018 --> 14:54.978
<i>I thought he'd help,
but he wouldn't.</i>

14:55.062 --> 14:57.230
Well, duh, I could've told you that.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.153
<i>Terry, I reviewed
Mad Stan's files.</i>

15:03.236 --> 15:04.988
There's a method to his madness.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.699
His rants are always triggered
by something in the news.

15:07.783 --> 15:10.077
I'm rechecking the latest sound bites.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.495
<i>Maybe something will turn up.</i>

15:11.578 --> 15:13.288
Hurry, we're running out of time.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.719
Hey, mister!
Why'd the Jokerz cross the road?

15:27.803 --> 15:28.887
I don't know.

15:28.970 --> 15:31.098
To beat up a geek on the other side.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.521
- You're not laughing.
- He's not laughing.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.482
I'II lay him lower.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.113
Huh? He can't do that. Jump him!

15:48.323 --> 15:49.574
Winning.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.585
I don't have time for this.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.313
You come near my windshield,
you'd better have a squeegee.

16:20.397 --> 16:21.565
It's no joke, Bats.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.233
We were goofing on some weird dude.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.569
He was so strong,
he started tossing us like pies.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.736
Which way did he go?

16:27.279 --> 16:29.823
<i>I got a lead,
he's heading towards the Civic Center.</i>

16:29.906 --> 16:31.700
What do you think, City Hall?

16:31.783 --> 16:33.994
No, try the Department Of Health.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.122
<i>There's a small item about them
raising the fee for pet licenses.</i>

16:37.205 --> 16:38.623
Pet licenses?

16:51.553 --> 16:53.221
You were right, he's here.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.235
Zeta! Stop!

17:07.319 --> 17:08.486
Batman?

17:13.909 --> 17:15.327
Sorry about this.

17:17.871 --> 17:18.914
Duck.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.096
So, Mad Stan told you R0 was here?

17:35.180 --> 17:36.514
He saved me from Agent Bennett.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.351
- Why would he lie?
- Well, he is mad.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.228
But don't worry, I'll take you to her.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.772
Don't move.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.565
We have the building
completely surrounded.

17:56.618 --> 17:57.953
<i>Bennett.</i>

18:01.873 --> 18:03.792
- How did he find me?
- Sony.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.252
I must have led him right to you.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.544
You did what you had to.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.925
- There's no way out. You go.
- But-

18:12.008 --> 18:13.343
No, I have to face him alone.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.280
Sir, look.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.541
Let him go. Even he can't help Zeta now.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.750
Move in!

18:53.633 --> 18:57.220
Maintain perimeter. Search every room.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.357
You there! Freeze!

19:09.524 --> 19:10.524
Huh?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.787
It's okay. He's solid. Keep looking.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.055
I found this attached to your car.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.282
So that's how Bennett tracked me.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.202
- Not anymore.
- What will you do now?

20:02.285 --> 20:04.245
I checked the registry
of the Science Symposium.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.539
The man we were looking for
has already moved on.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.832
Then I guess we should, too.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.127
Good luck.

20:13.588 --> 20:16.091
Zee was right. You're a real friend.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.174
Thanks!

20:25.141 --> 20:27.769
I can't believe
you actually trusted Mad Stan.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.355
I mean, wasn't the name
kind of a giveaway?
