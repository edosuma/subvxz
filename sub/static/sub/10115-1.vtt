01:55.605 --> 01:58.940
I'm standing here just a few
yards away from what appears to

01:58.942 --> 02:00.608
yards away from what appears to
be the final resting place for

02:00.610 --> 02:02.810

are too badly decomposed for any
physical identification to take place.

02:55.765 --> 03:03.765

What a gyp.

06:00.550 --> 06:01.982
Well, we didn't shake on it.
What a gyp.

06:01.984 --> 06:04.885
What a gyp. Technically,
you said "best in

06:04.887 --> 06:06.854
technically, you said "best in
Alabama," so I can't really be

06:06.856 --> 06:08.556
technically, you said "best in Alabama," so i
can't really be proven wrong until I've tried

06:08.558 --> 06:10.157
Alabama," so I can't really be proven wrong
until I've tried all the barbecue joints in the

06:10.159 --> 06:13.394
proven wrong until I've tried all
the barbecue joints in the state.

06:13.396 --> 06:14.462
All the barbecue joints in the state.
All right.

06:14.464 --> 06:16.564
State. >> All right. It's
gonna eat up the weekend,

06:16.566 --> 06:18.165
all right. It's gonna eat up
the weekend, but let's get on it.

06:18.167 --> 06:19.366
It's gonna eat up the
weekend, but let's get on it.

06:19.368 --> 06:20.835
But let's get on it.
Okay, fine. Fine.

06:20.837 --> 06:22.002
Okay, fine. Fine.
You're right.

06:22.004 --> 06:23.204
Okay, fine. Fine. You're right.
Holy crap!

06:23.206 --> 06:24.371
You're right. >> Holy crap!
That took months.

06:24.373 --> 06:26.207
Holy crap! That took months.
Yeah, well, don't get used to

06:26.209 --> 06:27.041
that took months. >> Yeah,
well, don't get used to it.

06:27.043 --> 06:28.943
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.
I won't.

06:28.945 --> 06:36.945
Mmm. That takes me back. >>
So, everything here is either

06:39.388 --> 06:41.355
that takes me back. >> So, everything here
is either fried or smothered in barbecue

06:41.357 --> 06:42.857
so, everything here is either fried
or smothered in barbecue sauce?

06:42.859 --> 06:43.958
Fried or smothered in barbecue sauce?
Pretty much, yeah.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.327
Sauce? >> Pretty much, yeah.

06:46.329 --> 06:47.628
Pretty much, yeah. >> I
can see why you liked this

06:47.630 --> 06:48.462
I can see why you liked
this place as a kid.

06:48.464 --> 06:49.396
I can see why you liked this
place as a kid. >> Oh... here.

06:49.398 --> 06:51.332
Place as a kid. >> Oh... here.
I thought you meant the south.

06:51.334 --> 06:52.333
Oh... here. I thought
you meant the south.

06:52.335 --> 06:55.002
I thought you meant the south.
Either way, you're right.

06:55.004 --> 06:57.138
Either way, you're right.
So, are you glad to be home?

06:57.140 --> 06:57.571
Either way, you're right. >> So,
are you glad to be home? >> Yeah.

06:57.573 --> 06:59.073
So, are you glad to be home? >> Yeah.
I'm glad I could finally make

06:59.075 --> 07:00.474
yeah. I'm glad I could finally
make good on my promise to come visit

07:00.476 --> 07:02.343
I'm glad I could finally make good on my
promise to come visit for the holidays.

07:02.345 --> 07:04.044
Good on my promise to come visit
for the holidays. >> Holiday?

07:04.046 --> 07:06.013
For the holidays. >> Holiday?
It's Halloween.

07:06.015 --> 07:07.882
Holiday? >> It's Halloween.
Halloween is a holiday?

07:07.884 --> 07:09.316
It's Halloween. >> Halloween is a
holiday? >> Well, it is with my family.

07:09.318 --> 07:10.384
Halloween is a holiday? >> Well,
it is with my family. >> Really?

07:10.386 --> 07:11.552
Well, it is with my family.
Really?

07:11.554 --> 07:12.920
Really? >> They
get real into it.

07:12.922 --> 07:14.155
They get real into it.
You know, my uncle spends a

07:14.157 --> 07:15.356
they get real into it. You know, my
uncle spends a fortune every year on this

07:15.358 --> 07:16.423
you know, my uncle spends a fortune
every year on this hayride.

07:16.425 --> 07:18.092
Fortune every year on this hayride.
Well, I'm kind of looking

07:18.094 --> 07:19.293
hayride. >> Well, I'm kind of
looking forward to a hayride.

07:19.295 --> 07:21.629
Well, I'm kind of looking forward to
a hayride. I think it's gonna be fun.

07:21.631 --> 07:23.931
Forward to a hayride. I think it's
gonna be fun. >> No. It's terrifying.

07:23.933 --> 07:26.167
I think it's gonna be fun. >> No. It's
terrifying. I still have nightmares from it.

07:26.169 --> 07:28.636
No. It's terrifying. I still have
nightmares from it. >> Are you serious?

07:28.638 --> 07:30.204
I still have nightmares from it.
Are you serious? >> Not really.

07:30.206 --> 07:32.606
Are you serious? >> Not really.
But it is insane.

07:32.608 --> 07:34.408
Not really. But it is insane.
They come up with different back

07:34.410 --> 07:35.976
but it is insane. They come up with
different back stories and have these

07:35.978 --> 07:37.411
they come up with different back stories
and have these reoccurring characters.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.079
Stories and have these reoccurring
characters. >> Like... their own horror

07:39.081 --> 07:40.214
reoccurring characters. >>
Like... their own horror characters?

07:40.216 --> 07:42.249
Like... their own horror characters?
We have, uh, pitchfork and

07:42.251 --> 07:43.617
characters? >> We have, uh, pitchfork
and raw-head bloody bones.

07:43.619 --> 07:46.120
We have, uh, pitchfork and raw-head
bloody bones. >> I'm sorry... what?

07:46.122 --> 07:48.088
Raw-head bloody bones. >> I'm sorry...
What? >> It's raw-head bloody bones.

07:48.090 --> 07:50.024
I'm sorry... what? >> It's raw-head
bloody bones. It's a monster that my grandpa

07:50.026 --> 07:52.059
it's raw-head bloody bones. It's a monster
that my grandpa made up that only comes out when

07:52.061 --> 07:53.694
it's a monster that my grandpa made up that only
comes out when it's windy... for some reason.

07:53.696 --> 07:56.630
Made up that only comes out when it's windy... for
some reason. >> But... why... why was his head

07:56.632 --> 07:58.265
it's windy... for some reason. >>
But... why... why was his head raw?

07:58.267 --> 07:59.266
But... why... why was his head raw?
I don't know that.

07:59.268 --> 08:00.601
Raw? >> I don't know that. I
never really got that part of

08:00.603 --> 08:01.468
I don't know that. I never
really got that part of the story.

08:01.470 --> 08:03.037
I never really got that part of the story.
But to this day...

08:03.039 --> 08:04.138
The story. But to this day...

08:04.140 --> 08:05.372
But to this day... wind
chimes still creep me

08:05.374 --> 08:06.140
wind chimes still
creep me out a bit.

08:06.142 --> 08:06.941
Wind chimes still
creep me out a bit.

08:06.943 --> 08:07.708
Out a bit. >> Seriously, though,

08:07.710 --> 08:09.643
seriously, though,
pitchfork... he used to scare

08:09.645 --> 08:11.145
seriously, though, pitchfork...
He used to scare the crap out of me.

08:11.147 --> 08:12.580
Pitchfork... he used to scare the crap
out of me. >> What was his story?

08:12.582 --> 08:14.148
The crap out of me. >> What was his story?
Well, he... it changed a

08:14.150 --> 08:15.649
what was his story? >> Well, he... it
changed a little bit as I got older, but

08:15.651 --> 08:17.418
well, he... it changed a little bit as I got
older, but basically, he was a guy that my

08:17.420 --> 08:19.520
little bit as I got older, but basically, he
was a guy that my uncle said would come out on

08:19.522 --> 08:21.989
basically, he was a guy that my uncle said would
come out on full moons to revenge the death

08:21.991 --> 08:23.958
uncle said would come out on full moons to revenge
the death of his daughter... or something

08:23.960 --> 08:26.093
full moons to revenge the death of his
daughter... or something like that.

08:26.095 --> 08:27.294
Of his daughter... or something like that.
Why does the killer always

08:27.296 --> 08:28.462
like that. >> Why does the killer
always have to come out at certain

08:28.464 --> 08:29.129
why does the killer always have
to come out at certain times?

08:29.131 --> 08:30.698
Have to come out at certain times?
That's a good question.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.466
Times? >> That's a good question.
And it always happens to be

08:32.467 --> 08:34.301
that's a good question. And it always
happens to be under the same conditions in

08:34.303 --> 08:37.037
and it always happens to be under the same
conditions in which the story is being told.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.172
Under the same conditions in
which the story is being told.

08:38.174 --> 08:40.506
- Which the story is being told.
- I think you've cracked the case.

08:40.509 --> 08:42.308
I think you've cracked the case.
That's what I do.

08:42.311 --> 08:44.745
I think you've cracked the case. >> That's
what I do. So, pitchfork kind of had a lame

08:44.747 --> 08:45.713
that's what I do. So, pitchfork
kind of had a lame back story?

08:45.715 --> 08:47.281
So, pitchfork kind of had a lame
back story? >> No, no, no, no.

08:47.283 --> 08:49.149
Back story? >> No, no, no, no.
You have to keep it simple.

08:49.151 --> 08:51.151
No, no, no, no. You have to keep it
simple. You know, "here's the killer.

08:51.153 --> 08:53.187
You have to keep it simple. You know, "here's
the killer. Here's how he started killing.

08:53.189 --> 08:55.155
You know, "here's the killer. Here's how he
started killing. Here's who he's gonna kill."

08:55.157 --> 08:56.390
Here's how he started killing. Here's who
he's gonna kill." Simpler is scarier.

08:56.392 --> 08:58.158
Here's who he's gonna kill." Simpler
is scarier. People don't come to these

08:58.160 --> 09:00.094
simpler is scarier. People don't come
to these things to learn some lesson in

09:00.096 --> 09:01.729
people don't come to these things to learn
some lesson in life or to hear a compelling

09:01.731 --> 09:02.763
things to learn some lesson in life
or to hear a compelling story.

09:02.765 --> 09:06.500
Life or to hear a compelling story.
They come to be scared.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.135
Story. They come to be scared.
Sounds like lazy writing to

09:08.137 --> 09:08.402
they come to be scared. >>
Sounds like lazy writing to me.

09:08.404 --> 09:09.336
Sounds like lazy writing to me.
I'm just saying.

09:09.338 --> 09:10.137
Me. I'm just saying.

09:10.139 --> 09:11.505
I'm just saying. >> Well,
you know, each year, my

09:11.507 --> 09:12.773
well, you know, each year, my
uncle would get a little more

09:12.775 --> 09:14.275
well, you know, each year, my uncle would get
a little more gruesome with the details, you

09:14.277 --> 09:14.575
uncle would get a little more
gruesome with the details, you know?

09:14.577 --> 09:17.211
Gruesome with the details, you know?
Add more to the story.

09:17.213 --> 09:20.114
Know? Add more to the story.
Pitchfork was scary.

09:20.116 --> 09:21.482
Add more to the story. Pitchfork was scary.
Sounds like it.

09:21.484 --> 09:22.683
Pitchfork was scary. >> Sounds like it.
Yeah, I bet.

09:22.685 --> 09:24.618
Sounds like it. >> Yeah, I bet.
So, why do they call him

09:24.620 --> 09:27.087
yeah, I bet. >> So, why do
they call him "pitchfork"?

09:27.089 --> 09:29.423
So, why do they call him "pitchfork"?
Take a guess.

09:29.425 --> 09:30.024
"Pitchfork"? >> Take a guess.
Hm.

09:30.026 --> 09:31.725
Take a guess. >> Hm. Because
he killed people with a

09:31.727 --> 09:32.559
hm. Because he killed
people with a pitchfork.

09:32.561 --> 09:34.528
Because he killed people with a pitchfork.
Because he killed people with

09:34.530 --> 09:35.429
pitchfork. >> Because he killed
people with a pitchfork.

09:35.431 --> 09:37.064
Because he killed people with a
pitchfork. That's absolutely right.

09:37.066 --> 09:38.265
A pitchfork. That's
absolutely right.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.567
That's absolutely right. Your
uncle's not a very original

09:40.569 --> 09:41.769
your uncle's not a very
original guy, I take it.

09:41.771 --> 09:42.803
Your uncle's not a very original
guy, I take it. >> You'll see.

09:42.805 --> 09:44.672
- Guy, I take it.
- >> You'll see.

09:51.580 --> 09:59.580
Wincer, we got a marshal who's down
here. I went ahead and sent him on

10:04.760 --> 10:05.359
who's down here. I went ahead
and sent him on through.

10:05.361 --> 10:06.527
I went ahead and sent him on through.
He should be heading your way

10:06.529 --> 10:08.449
through. He should be
heading your way right now.

10:16.038 --> 10:24.038
You wincer? >> Yeah. >>
What are we looking at here?

10:25.047 --> 10:32.386
Well, we got a dead cop... one of yours.
We got a dead unknown... local,

10:32.388 --> 10:33.854
one of yours. We got a dead unknown...
Local, by the looks of his clothes.

10:33.856 --> 10:37.691
We got a dead unknown... local,
by the looks of his clothes.

10:37.693 --> 10:39.393
By the looks of his clothes.
Looks like the cop lost control

10:39.395 --> 10:41.095
looks like the cop lost control
of the vehicle and our boy took

10:41.097 --> 10:42.429
looks like the cop lost control of the vehicle
and our boy took advantage of the situation.

10:42.431 --> 10:44.751
Of the vehicle and our boy took
advantage of the situation.

10:54.143 --> 11:02.143
Any idea which direction he went?
South, by the looks of the

11:09.325 --> 11:10.624
went? >> South, by the
looks of the tracks.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.658
South, by the looks of the tracks.
Not much past that.

11:11.660 --> 11:13.093
Tracks. Not much past that.
We put up a perimeter about 5

11:13.095 --> 11:13.427
not much past that. We put up
a perimeter about 5 miles.

11:13.429 --> 11:14.128
We put up a perimeter about 5 miles.
All right.

11:14.130 --> 11:15.295
Miles. >> All right. So,
we got any houses nearby,

11:15.297 --> 11:16.864
all right. So, we got any houses
nearby, any stores... anything?

11:16.866 --> 11:18.165
So, we got any houses nearby, any stores
anything? >> So, you're not from around

11:18.167 --> 11:19.700
any stores... anything? >> So, you're
not from around here, I take it?

11:19.702 --> 11:21.769
So, you're not from around
here, I take it? >> No. I'm not.

11:21.771 --> 11:23.370
Here, I take it? >> No.
I'm not. >> Well, no.

11:23.372 --> 11:25.672
No. I'm not. >> Well, no.
Nothing else out here.

11:25.674 --> 11:27.107
Well, no. Nothing else out here.
So, these roads, they don't,

11:27.109 --> 11:28.342
nothing else out here. >> So, these roads,
they don't, uh, they don't go anywhere?

11:28.344 --> 11:30.110
So, these roads, they don't, uh,
they don't go anywhere? >> Oh, yeah.

11:30.112 --> 11:32.713
Uh, they don't go anywhere? >> Oh, yeah.
They go, uh... nowhere.

11:32.715 --> 11:35.215
Oh, yeah. They go, uh... nowhere.
We got a lot of that out here.

11:35.217 --> 11:35.582
They go, uh... nowhere. We got a
lot of that out here. >> Okay.

11:35.584 --> 11:36.750

The property line in the back there.
You know, uh, it looks run-down

you know, uh, it looks run-down now, but
back in the day, it was pretty set.

pretty set. About the last
farmer that existed around here.

25:37.926 --> 25:41.394
About the last farmer that existed around
here. And when rayborn would come into

would come into town for supplies, he'd

and when rayborn would come into town for
supplies, he'd sometimes bring his daughter.

26:28.877 --> 26:36.877
Yeah, the banks had this grand plan to
make all this area into a subdivision.

26:49.464 --> 26:51.364
Plan to make all this area into a
subdivision. You know, there'd be houses all

They tried to do that with
us a few times. But, uh...

27:08.683 --> 27:11.117
Few times. But, uh... back
on the subject, rayborn's

but, uh... back on the
subject, rayborn's daughter...

I mean, when she was a kid, she
was a beautiful little girl, but

little girl, but she did what every beautiful

what every beautiful little girl does.

daughter on occasion, everyone in town would have

27:32.741 --> 27:34.273
take his daughter on occasion, everyone
in town would have their eye on her.

27:34.275 --> 27:36.242
Everyone in town would have their eye
on her. They say he carried a pitchfork

their eye on her. They say he
carried a pitchfork because of her.

27:37.679 --> 27:40.213
They say he carried a pitchfork because
of her. And the joke was that if you'd

27:40.215 --> 27:45.651
because of her. And the joke was that if
you'd mess with rayborn's daughter...

27:45.653 --> 27:48.254
And the joke was that if you'd mess with rayborn's
daughter... you mess with the pitchfork.

that his daughter and her new boyfriend had

and her new boyfriend had murdered his wife and
the sight threw him into a murderous rage.

30:33.721 --> 30:34.820
Murdered his wife and the sight threw him into

I believe that seeing that his wife let his only
daughter run away drove him over the edge...

30:45.700 --> 30:48.301
Wife let his only daughter run away drove him
over the edge... and she became his first...

30:48.303 --> 30:50.603
Away drove him over the edge... and she
became his first... but not last... victim.

Now, old pitchfork had a problem.
He knew that his daughter had

31:41.556 --> 31:42.655
problem. He knew that his daughter
had run off with one of the

he knew that his daughter had run off with
one of the neighbors' boys, but he didn't

31:43.958 --> 31:45.758
run off with one of the neighbors'
boys, but he didn't know which one.

31:45.760 --> 31:53.760
So he took his revenge
out on everyone.

32:36.577 --> 32:44.577
From house to house, he went
searching for his missing daughter.

Okay. Sweet dreams.
Good night, gorgeous.

36:14.929 --> 36:22.929
 When all that cold
has gone away and ended 

36:26.007 --> 36:34.007
 and she takes all of this
lonely mess >> I have to pee!

36:48.129 --> 36:56.129
Lucky bastard. I thought you were
in there whacking off or something.

36:57.204 --> 36:57.836
I thought you were in there
whacking off or something.

36:57.838 --> 36:59.705
Whacking off or something.
You son of a bitch.

36:59.707 --> 37:02.041
You son of a bitch.

37:02.043 --> 37:03.075
You son of a bitch.
How was she?

37:03.077 --> 37:06.278
How was she? >> Dude.

37:06.280 --> 37:10.049
How was she? >> Dude. >>
 and those summer days,

37:10.051 --> 37:13.218
dude. >> and those
summer days, are here again 

37:13.220 --> 37:15.120
 and those summer
days, are here again 

37:33.441 --> 37:41.441
Who's there?

37:44.885 --> 37:52.885
You ever find those traps?

38:02.370 --> 38:03.969
You ever find those traps?
No.

38:03.971 --> 38:05.304
You ever find those traps? >> No.
Think somebody stole them.

38:05.306 --> 38:06.672
No. Think somebody stole them.
It was probably Jeff.

38:06.674 --> 38:07.940
Think somebody stole them. >> It was
probably Jeff. His trucking business went

38:07.942 --> 38:09.274
it was probably Jeff. His trucking
business went under, and he's the one that

38:09.276 --> 38:10.843
his trucking business went under, and
he's the one that helped me put them out.

38:10.845 --> 38:11.977
Under, and he's the one that
helped me put them out. >> Huh.

38:11.979 --> 38:13.779
Helped me put them out. >> Huh.
They'll probably turn up, man.

38:13.781 --> 38:15.981
Huh. They'll probably
turn up, man. >> Mm.

38:15.983 --> 38:17.282
They'll probably turn up, man. >> Mm.
Man, it is gonna be a bitch if

38:17.284 --> 38:18.784
mm. Man, it is gonna be a bitch
if we have to run all these lights

38:18.786 --> 38:20.886
man, it is gonna be a bitch if we have
to run all these lights again tomorrow.

38:20.888 --> 38:22.054
We have to run all these
lights again tomorrow.

38:22.056 --> 38:23.822
Again tomorrow.
We'll be all right.

38:23.824 --> 38:25.224
We'll be all right.
No problem, man.

38:25.226 --> 38:26.258
We'll be all right. No problem, man.
We'll get it done.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.361
No problem, man. We'll get it done.
Yeah.

38:29.363 --> 38:31.096
We'll get it done. >> Yeah.
It's a hell of a ride.

38:31.098 --> 38:32.898
Yeah. >> It's a hell of a ride.
Hell of a ride, bro.

38:32.900 --> 38:39.038
Oh! Oh!

39:23.617 --> 39:31.617
You okay? >> Yeah. Just couldn't sleep.
Yeah, me either.

39:39.433 --> 39:41.834
Yeah. Just couldn't sleep.
Yeah, me either. >> Why not?

39:41.836 --> 39:42.334
Yeah, me either. >> Why not?

39:42.336 --> 39:46.405
Why not? Uh... mind
racing, I guess.

39:46.407 --> 39:50.075
Uh... mind racing, I guess.
Whole lot of memories here.

39:50.077 --> 39:51.477
Uh... mind racing, I guess. Whole lot
of memories here. >> Good ones?

39:51.479 --> 39:53.212
Whole lot of memories here. >> Good ones?
Yeah. Definitely.

39:53.214 --> 39:55.447
Good ones? >> Yeah. Definitely.
You know, it's weird, but you

39:55.449 --> 39:56.782
yeah. Definitely. You know, it's weird,
but you spend half your life pretending

39:56.784 --> 39:57.983
you know, it's weird, but you spend half your
life pretending you're not from Alabama, and the

39:57.985 --> 39:59.017
spend half your life pretending you're not from
Alabama, and the rest, you're pretending you

39:59.019 --> 39:59.718
you're not from Alabama, and the rest,
you're pretending you don't miss it.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.453
Rest, you're pretending
you don't miss it.

40:01.455 --> 40:03.355
Don't miss it. I guess
we moved around too much

40:03.357 --> 40:05.224
I guess we moved around too much
for me to really miss anyplace

40:05.226 --> 40:07.192
I guess we moved around too much for me
to really miss anyplace in particular.

40:07.194 --> 40:08.794
For me to really miss anyplace in
particular. My dad's job moved us to

40:08.796 --> 40:09.862
in particular. My dad's job
moved us to San Diego once.

40:09.864 --> 40:11.130
My dad's job moved us to San Diego once.
That was really nice.

40:11.132 --> 40:12.998
San Diego once. That was really nice.
I bet.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.299
That was really nice. >> I bet.
How old were you when you

40:14.301 --> 40:15.367
I bet. >> How old were you
when you moved in with Morgan?

40:15.369 --> 40:16.769
How old were you when you
moved in with Morgan? >> 10.

40:16.771 --> 40:19.037
Moved in with Morgan? >> 10.
Was your aunt still alive?

40:19.039 --> 40:19.404
10. >> Was your aunt still alive?
Yeah.

40:19.406 --> 40:21.173
Was your aunt still alive?
Yeah. She...

40:21.175 --> 40:22.875
Yeah. She... she didn't
pass away until I was

40:22.877 --> 40:24.676
she... she didn't pass away
until I was in high school.

40:24.678 --> 40:32.678
Were you close? >> She was
my mom for about six years.

40:35.356 --> 40:36.922
She was my mom for about six years.
I'm sorry.

40:36.924 --> 40:39.892
Years. >> I'm sorry.
Nah, it's okay.

40:39.894 --> 40:41.326
I'm sorry. >> Nah, it's okay.
She was probably as close as a

40:41.328 --> 40:43.028
nah, it's okay. She was probably as close
as a person could be to a Saint these

40:43.030 --> 40:44.830
she was probably as close as a person
could be to a Saint these days.

40:44.832 --> 40:52.832
She, of all people, didn't need to hurt
anymore. So, it was just me, Corey, and

40:54.775 --> 40:57.109
to hurt anymore. So, it was just
me, Corey, and uncle Morgan.

40:57.111 --> 41:00.846
So, it was just me, Corey, and uncle
Morgan. Somehow, we made it work.

41:00.848 --> 41:02.014
Uncle Morgan. Somehow,
we made it work.

41:02.016 --> 41:04.316
Somehow, we made it work. We
used to quiz each other on

41:04.318 --> 41:06.518
we used to quiz each other on
microwave directions for TV

41:06.520 --> 41:09.021
we used to quiz each other on microwave
directions for TV dinners and chicken pot pies.

41:09.023 --> 41:10.389
Microwave directions for TV dinners and
chicken pot pies. We were scary-good at it.

41:10.391 --> 41:12.257
Dinners and chicken pot pies. We were scary-good
at it. You name the item and the brand,

41:12.259 --> 41:14.092
we were scary-good at it. You name the item and
the brand, and we could give you the exact

41:14.094 --> 41:15.828
you name the item and the brand, and we could
give you the exact time and heating instruction.

41:15.830 --> 41:17.529
And we could give you the exact
time and heating instruction.

41:17.531 --> 41:19.364
Time and heating instruction.
Well, that's a valuable

41:19.366 --> 41:20.065
well, that's a
valuable skill.

41:20.067 --> 41:21.066
Well, that's a
valuable skill.

41:21.068 --> 41:23.035
- Skill.
- >> Well, it comes in handy at

41:23.037 --> 41:24.236
well, it comes in handy
at school sometimes.

41:24.238 --> 41:26.004
Well, it comes in handy at school
sometimes. But only if it's an older

41:26.006 --> 41:26.905
school sometimes. But only
if it's an older microwave.

41:26.907 --> 41:28.907
But only if it's an older microwave.
If the wattage is too high, my

41:28.909 --> 41:30.843
microwave. If the wattage is too
high, my powers are useless.

41:30.845 --> 41:34.012
If the wattage is too high,
my powers are useless.

41:34.014 --> 41:35.581
Powers are useless. >> Well,
i didn't exactly have a

41:35.583 --> 41:39.251
well, I didn't exactly have
a normal childhood, either.

41:39.253 --> 41:41.453
Well, I didn't exactly have a normal
childhood, either. And I always said when I got

41:41.455 --> 41:43.889
normal childhood, either. And I always said
when I got older and had kids of my own

41:43.891 --> 41:45.824
and I always said when I got older and had
kids of my own that our lives would be

41:45.826 --> 41:48.260
older and had kids of my own that our lives
would be perfectly normal and boring, you

41:48.262 --> 41:49.127
that our lives would be perfectly
normal and boring, you know?

41:49.129 --> 41:52.898
Perfectly normal and boring, you know?
House, fenced yard, dogs, church

41:52.900 --> 41:54.399
know? House, fenced yard,
dogs, church on Sundays.

41:54.401 --> 41:57.035
House, fenced yard, dogs, church on
Sundays. >> Mortgage, arguing about tile

41:57.037 --> 41:59.304
on Sundays. >> Mortgage, arguing about
tile in the bathroom, family game

41:59.306 --> 42:00.005
mortgage, arguing about tile in
the bathroom, family game night.

42:00.007 --> 42:01.006
In the bathroom,
family game night.

42:01.008 --> 42:04.176
Night. Exactly.

42:04.178 --> 42:07.179
Exactly. >> I'm in.

42:07.181 --> 42:09.948
Exactly. >> I'm in. >> Really?

42:09.950 --> 42:11.817
I'm in. >> Really? >>
That's the plan, isn't it?

42:11.819 --> 42:19.819
Otherwise, what are we working towards?
I mean, you've seen the level of

42:21.328 --> 42:23.061
towards? I mean, you've seen the level
of normalcy that I had to grow up

42:23.063 --> 42:25.564
I mean, you've seen the level of
normalcy that I had to grow up with.

42:25.566 --> 42:27.366
Normalcy that I had to grow up with.
Why wouldn't I want that?

42:27.368 --> 42:35.368
 Sitting here in the dark >> so, uh...
Did you wanna...

42:42.516 --> 42:43.982
So, uh... did you wanna...
Are you serious?

42:43.984 --> 42:44.583
Did you wanna... >> Are you serious?
Yeah.

42:44.585 --> 42:46.351
Are you serious? >> Yeah.
We'll wake everyone up.

42:46.353 --> 42:48.387
Yeah. >> We'll wake everyone up.
I think you overestimate my

42:48.389 --> 42:49.288
we'll wake everyone up. >> I think
you overestimate my abilities.

42:49.290 --> 42:50.355
I think you
overestimate my abilities.

42:50.357 --> 42:52.057
- Abilities.
- I still don't think it's a good

42:52.059 --> 42:53.659
I still don't think
it's a good idea.

42:53.661 --> 42:55.027
I still don't think it's a good idea.
Are you sure?

42:55.029 --> 42:57.162
Idea. >> Are you sure?
I'm half done already.

42:57.164 --> 43:01.667

- I'm half done already.

43:01.669 --> 43:05.237

I think so.

43:11.478 --> 43:14.146
Was that thunder? >> I think so.
That's bad, isn't it?

43:14.148 --> 43:15.213
I think so. >> That's
bad, isn't it? >> Yep.

43:15.215 --> 43:17.082
That's bad, isn't it?
Yep. That's bad.

This rain's gonna hurt our tracking.
Well, we could get, uh,

43:44.945 --> 43:46.478
tracking. >> Well, we could get,
uh, canoes for everybody to go out

43:46.480 --> 43:48.213

for everybody to go out in.

43:48.215 --> 43:56.215
