Whoa! Geez, Carlos,
thanks for the heart attack.

01:00.300 --> 01:03.600

Mystery solved.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.600
- What happened?
- Found a crazed plumber.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.600
- [ Screaming ]

02:46.700 --> 02:48.900

03:14.800 --> 03:18.800
Hmm.
And how is that okay?

that most of our employees want us dead.

<i>You wanna feel disconnected,</i>

Not many fates worse than that,
I'd wager.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.900
<i>Okay, maybe that.</i>

05:20.900 --> 05:23.500
I know what you're sayin' about the disconnect.

No, one of ours. The mail guy-- Number Five.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Why did he attack you?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.300
- Tried to give him the mail.
- Security's on it.

<i>- We'll find him.</i>
- Look, this is just a-a thing.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.900

Angel attacked

07:26.700 --> 07:29.800
- What?
- Not Number Five?

07:29.800 --> 07:33.800
- You didn't hurt him?
- No! I-- He attacked me.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.800
- We should find him.
- Absolutely.

Holy tornado, it's true.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.700
Yeah, it was amazing.

one major smackdown.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.600

Yeah, remind me again how
you ended up in the front seat.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.400
Called shotgun, mate.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
Oh.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.500
I thought we were doing
a weapons check.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.000
Nothin' wrong with that.
We may need these bad boys...

09:20.000 --> 09:23.800

Day of the Dead heart-suckin' monster.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.000

is about half a mile--

09:27.000 --> 09:30.300
[ Tires Screeching ]

Too late.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.700
So you, what, heard a scream?

09:58.300 --> 10:01.500

He smelled the blood.

<i>Looks like it was cut out</i>
<i>with some sort of crude knife.</i>

10:20.900 --> 10:22.900
Based on
these blood spatters...

10:22.900 --> 10:24.800
I'd say it was still beating

10:24.800 --> 10:26.700
Blood's fresh.
This just happened.

10:26.700 --> 10:29.700

Yeah, I can see that.

- No, it's a source book.

<i>You know, the prophecy that says</i>

Yes.

Uh, though it's a bit
more complicated than that.

14:29.800 --> 14:33.000
Complicated?

14:33.000 --> 14:36.100
It tells of an epic,
apocalyptic battle...

14:36.100 --> 14:39.300
and a vampire with a soul
who plays a major role in that battle.

14:39.300 --> 14:42.700
<i>And there is a suggestion that</i>
<i>the vampire will get to live again.</i>

14:42.700 --> 14:45.800
When you say ''plays a major role
in an apocalyptic battle,''

14:45.800 --> 14:50.700
you mean like, um, heroically closing a
Hellmouth that was about to destroy the world?

29:20.500 --> 29:23.100
After everything we've seen
in the past couple of years?

29:24.200 --> 29:26.800
''The father will kill the son.''

29:26.800 --> 29:29.800
What are you talking about?

29:29.800 --> 29:31.700
Look, we're gettin'
the work done.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.600
As long as I keep doin' what I do,
it doesn't matter...

29:33.600 --> 29:36.400
if I believe in the Shanshu
or any other prophecy.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.600
I'm sorry, Angel,
but nothing matters more.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.900
Hope. It's the only thing
that will sustain you--

29:42.900 --> 29:45.300
that will keep you from ending up
like Number Five.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.800
<i>[ Telephone Ringing ]</i>

29:51.500 --> 29:55.000
Yeah?
It's Fred.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
She's got something.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.400
So it's eating the hearts of heroes,
and their blood is what keeps it alive.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.300
Yeah, but it does
more than that.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.700
It acts like a kind
of supercharged rocket fuel.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.700
- Makes it, you know--
- Nigh invulnerable.

30:14.700 --> 30:18.200
Oh, I could kill it.
I mean, ghostiness to the contrary.

30:18.200 --> 30:22.100
<i>Come on, lads.</i>
<i>Everything has an Achilles'heel.</i>

30:22.500 --> 30:25.500
- And you just happen to know
this creature's Achilles' heel?
- I'll wager it's the heart.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.500
You see that in the science?

30:29.500 --> 30:32.400
No, luv, in the poetry.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.600
We're dealing with
a mythic creature here.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.500
A kill-or-be-killed
kind of creature.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.500
If I was gonna kill something
that was tryin' to take my heart...

30:39.500 --> 30:41.700
I'd try to bloody well
take its heart first.

30:41.700 --> 30:44.500
<i>You'd be doin'the right thing.</i>
<i>That'd stop it for the time being.</i>

30:44.500 --> 30:47.500
- Time being?
- Yeah. He's kind of got a get-out-of-jail-free card.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.700
- It's in his contract.
- Contract?

30:49.700 --> 30:53.700
Figure of speech.
Curse, hex, any shady, supernatural deal...

30:53.700 --> 30:56.000
Wolfram and Hart
has a record of it.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.100
Tezcatcatl was one of the Aztecs'
most powerful warriors.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.000
He forged a mystical talisman
that would harness...

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
the power of their sun god,
make him supernova powerful.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.100
<i>But he got found out.</i>
<i>Was sentenced to die...</i>

31:05.100 --> 31:08.500
<i>- on the Aztec version of Day of the Dead.</i>
- So he made a mystical deal.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.600
Yeah, it was pretty clever, really.
He had their shaman...

31:10.600 --> 31:13.000
put a curse on him to return
from the dead every 50 years.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
<i>Been doin'it for centuries.</i>
<i>Usually that'd be a bad thing.</i>

31:16.000 --> 31:18.900
But in his case, it brings him back so
he can keep searching for the talisman.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.300
Any idea what happened
to the talisman?

31:21.300 --> 31:23.500
It was given to a great hero
in charge of protecting it.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.700
Which gets passed down
through the generations.

31:25.700 --> 31:29.300
So each time this demon returns,
it's searchin' for that talisman.

31:29.300 --> 31:32.800
<i>And if it finds it,</i>
<i>the demon becomes sun-god powerful...</i>

31:32.800 --> 31:36.500
and you sods become
a series of hearty snacks.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.500
- Is there a drawing of it?
<i>- [ Gunn ] Negative.</i>

31:38.500 --> 31:41.200
All I know is that it's gold,
about the size of a quarter...

31:41.200 --> 31:44.200
<i>and has the sun and some other</i>
<i>spooky mumbojumbo carved into it.</i>

31:47.700 --> 31:50.300
Oh, see?
Drama queen.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.200
Tezcatcatl.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.700
[ Speaking Spanish ]

32:18.700 --> 32:22.000
Come.
I wait for you.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.000
[ Sniffing ]

32:33.300 --> 32:35.400
<i>Won't work,you know.</i>

32:37.000 --> 32:39.600
You want the Aztec warrior
to come...

32:39.600 --> 32:41.500
to kill you so you can be
with your brothers.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.400
But he won't.

32:43.400 --> 32:47.400
He will be here.
I summoned him.

32:47.500 --> 32:51.500
Maybe.
But he won't kill you or me.

32:51.700 --> 32:55.500
Missing the secret ingredient. Now, give me
the talisman and I'll leave you to your misery.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.000
I don't have it.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.200
- Where is it?
- You are one strange man, Señor Angel.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.900
I'm not the one in a mask standing
in a cemetery in the middle of the night.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.400
No.
But you will be.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.800
You want this thing
to punch your ticket, fine.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.700
But I'm not gonna
let it get the talisman.

33:19.700 --> 33:23.500
Say you stop it. Then what? In 50 years
it's back, and nothing has changed.

33:23.500 --> 33:27.800
- Give it to me!
- You were right about Tezcatcatl
not wanting to kill me--

33:27.800 --> 33:30.700
that I am not a hero.

33:30.700 --> 33:34.700
So I had to find a way to fool him...
to make myself worthy.

33:34.700 --> 33:39.300
I swallowed the talisman. If he wants it,
he will have to cut it out of me.

33:45.600 --> 33:48.100
You want your talisman?

33:55.200 --> 33:57.700
Don't you remember?

33:57.700 --> 33:59.900
I'm the hombre
who destroyed you last time.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.900
Come on.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.000
It's in here.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Come and get it.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.000
[ Groans ]
That's it.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.100
Again.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.500
Not gonna make it
that easy for you.

34:41.699 --> 34:44.199
We already did
this little dance, remember?

34:50.400 --> 34:53.500
If you're looking for heroes,
you're wasting your time.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.300
- [ Groans ]
- No!

35:11.900 --> 35:13.700
About time
I taught you somethin'.

<i>Amigo. Ándale.!</i>

36:53.000 --> 36:55.100
We're tryin' to kill it,
not pin it.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.500
Okay, pinning works.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.400
[ Groaning ]

37:21.100 --> 37:23.000
Hey.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.200
<i>Mis hermanos,</i>
they came back.

37:26.200 --> 37:29.800
Because you're worthy.
You proved it.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.600
Maybe.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.800
But still, the demon
did not want my heart.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.400
- He didn't want mine either.
- Of course not, amigo.

37:40.400 --> 37:43.200
Who would want that dried-up
walnut of a dead thing?

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
[ Coughs ]
Coffee.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.900
Coffee?
You want coffee?

37:49.900 --> 37:53.300
<i>Estúpido.</i>
The talisman, it's in--

I may not be a hero,
but I am not a fool.

See if you can put this someplace safe.

39:23.700 --> 39:26.000
Angel, are you okay?
I know you've been feeling--

39:26.000 --> 39:27.900
I'm fine.

39:27.900 --> 39:30.300
Got the job done.
That's what's important.

Been a long day.

See you guys in the morning.

So, Number Five, he jumped in
and helped at the end?

He died a hero.
