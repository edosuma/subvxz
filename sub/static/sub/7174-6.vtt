screwed the golden goose.

00:09.397 --> 00:10.925
Stay away from <i>ta acqua!</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.900
<i>If your girlfriend
logged that distress call</i>

00:12.935 --> 00:14.888
<i>she's going to be living
it down for a long time.</i>

00:14.923 --> 00:16.631
- <i>I did it.</i>
- <i>Please help me.</i>

00:16.666 --> 00:18.132
It's all got to do with her.

00:18.167 --> 00:19.512
You need to take this upstairs.

00:19.578 --> 00:21.570
Maybe. Until then I'll just, uh...

00:21.605 --> 00:23.694
I guess I'll do my pathetic best.

00:23.729 --> 00:26.640
Before she shipped out, she asked
me to hook her up with a data broker.

00:26.675 --> 00:29.080
<i>She was hanging around
some hardcore OPA.</i>

00:29.115 --> 00:30.400
<i>Anderson Dawes.</i>

00:30.474 --> 00:32.741
Julie Mao was one of ours.

00:32.776 --> 00:36.658
Let me worry about her, and
you'll get Filat Kothari.

00:36.693 --> 00:38.424
Go get your justice.

00:38.541 --> 00:40.362
<i>Make it pretty.</i>

00:40.435 --> 00:43.230
<i>We can't resolve the drive
signatures or make any visual IDs.</i>

00:43.265 --> 00:46.218
Somebody has a new fleet of warships.

00:46.303 --> 00:48.416
I'm not a pilot, someone else needs to fly.

00:48.451 --> 00:49.071
I don't think I'm in any condition to...

00:49.106 --> 00:50.634
- Get us out of here!
- You got it.

00:58.065 --> 01:00.504
<i>You will be granted
safe harbor on Tycho.</i>

01:00.539 --> 01:03.256
<i>You have my solemn promise
that you will not be harmed.</i>

01:03.329 --> 01:05.111
I've known guys with causes.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.557
Causes that get people killed.

01:11.077 --> 01:13.966
You don't show up
anywhere without a reason.

01:15.308 --> 01:17.437
I don't work for you fine people anymore.

01:17.518 --> 01:19.398
So, why am I being ambushed?

01:19.490 --> 01:22.700
I need to borrow your spy on Tycho Station.

01:22.810 --> 01:24.194
What for?

01:24.282 --> 01:26.689
To keep an eye on Fred Johnson.

01:26.841 --> 01:31.006
He's over-charging the
Mormons for their toilet seats.

01:32.010 --> 01:33.761
Well, you can't have him.

01:33.989 --> 01:35.423
Why not?

01:35.458 --> 01:38.183
It took me five years to
sheep-dip him in Johnson's outfit,

01:38.218 --> 01:40.301
to steal tech for his competitors.

01:40.336 --> 01:42.564
He's worth a lot of money to me.

01:42.676 --> 01:45.493
What's... Sheep-dip?

01:45.831 --> 01:49.933
I wonder if they have ice
cream in the snack shop?

01:54.380 --> 01:56.264
The answer's no.

01:56.463 --> 02:00.264
I do my patriotic duty by
screwing over Fred Johnson,

02:00.384 --> 02:02.646
isn't that enough?

02:02.813 --> 02:05.440
How's your son, Esteban?

02:05.529 --> 02:08.395
He's up for parole soon.

02:10.174 --> 02:12.462
You're really gonna play that card?

02:12.554 --> 02:15.050
No games, no subterfuge,

02:15.084 --> 02:16.918
just straight for the jugular?

02:16.952 --> 02:20.555
I'd be happy to play
some other time, Carlos,

02:20.708 --> 02:22.641
but the matter is pressing.

02:22.791 --> 02:25.093
He made one mistake...

02:25.227 --> 02:27.322
Then help him move on.

02:27.413 --> 02:29.529
Let me help him.

02:30.466 --> 02:33.270
You know why I quit the intel desk?

02:33.527 --> 02:35.328
I couldn't tell anymore

02:35.504 --> 02:37.949
if I was still working for the good guys.

02:38.087 --> 02:41.504
I'll go get the ice cream,
you make the phone call.

James Holden.

03:39.776 --> 03:42.496
- You son of a bitch...
- Stay where you are.

03:42.924 --> 03:45.343
You either some kind of genius, Mr. Holden,

03:45.378 --> 03:47.763
or you the luckiest
dipshit in the solar system.

03:47.798 --> 03:49.087
Why did you invite us here?

03:49.122 --> 03:52.604
You two are the only witnesses to
a series of catastrophic events.

03:52.639 --> 03:54.489
You could be the key
to stopping all-out war.

03:54.524 --> 03:57.434
We're not the only
witnesses. You were watching.

03:57.469 --> 04:00.188
I've been out of the war
business a long time, son.

04:00.222 --> 04:01.773
I broker peace treaties these days...

04:01.807 --> 04:04.369
Not exactly what you're known for...

04:05.714 --> 04:07.460
You can put those guns away.

04:07.558 --> 04:09.359
Tell the others to come out.

04:09.537 --> 04:11.478
I'll give you safe harbor.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.055
And I'll get rid of that ship for you.

04:13.090 --> 04:14.402
No one's getting rid of our ship.

04:14.476 --> 04:17.244
Martian vessels come through
Tycho on a daily basis.

04:17.279 --> 04:20.709
If they see that frigate parked
there, it's a bad day for me too.

04:20.743 --> 04:22.514
I'm just the messenger,

04:22.612 --> 04:25.602
I have half a platoon of
pissed-off Martian marines

04:25.637 --> 04:27.719
who are just itching for some payback.

04:29.251 --> 04:30.212
Huh.

04:30.250 --> 04:33.954
That's a corvette-class Martian
frigate that typically crews thirty.

04:33.989 --> 04:35.774
I only see two of you.

04:35.863 --> 04:38.898
That tells me that you're
trying hard to hide your numbers.

04:39.011 --> 04:41.257
Tactically, if there were more,

04:41.292 --> 04:44.618
as a show of force you
would've brought them out.

04:44.696 --> 04:47.275
I'm guessing there are two to
four people left on your ship.

04:47.326 --> 04:50.440
And I'm confident that there's
no Martian Navy on board.

04:50.475 --> 04:54.361
If they were, they'd be out
here speaking with me now.

04:54.396 --> 04:58.984
You walked off that ship,
because you're in charge.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.304
At least you think you are...

05:01.397 --> 05:02.854
If I wanted to hurt you,

05:02.889 --> 05:07.137
I would have broadcast your transponder
and your position to the entire system...

05:07.172 --> 05:10.231
Coming here was your only option.

05:10.266 --> 05:13.217
But it was also your best option.

05:14.108 --> 05:17.910
Now, you want to continue to play games,

05:18.092 --> 05:21.073
or shall we talk about
how to help each other?

05:33.515 --> 05:35.032
I'm Lida.

05:35.113 --> 05:36.812
My brother, Kaipo.

05:37.748 --> 05:40.115
Your parents must be proud.

05:43.189 --> 05:45.397
Hey, hey!

05:45.813 --> 05:47.980
You can't do that to him.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.648
He's Star Helix.

05:55.085 --> 05:59.027
I take it then that you
don't want to be famous, huh?

06:02.756 --> 06:06.219
The old EVA helmets
used to burn like that...

06:06.254 --> 06:09.242
The contacts would cook your skin.

06:09.277 --> 06:11.612
Thanks for sharing.

06:11.775 --> 06:15.388
I had to let that
stinking animal Kothari go,

06:15.487 --> 06:18.359
since you weren't interested in him.

06:18.587 --> 06:22.174
We're going to have a
nice long talk, you and I.

06:22.866 --> 06:25.097

Setting the last charge now, uncle Mateo...

<i>Well hurry up, or you'll be

07:03.820 --> 07:05.653

07:21.434 --> 07:23.102
Did you pattern the charges?

07:23.137 --> 07:25.348
Yeah, yeah, just like you said...

07:37.394 --> 07:39.762
Time to make some money, <i>bachemang.</i>

08:04.405 --> 08:07.359

started, it was over pretty quick.</i>

08:07.409 --> 08:09.961
<i>The Martians barely

<i>The Donnager and the Cant were attacked
by the same class of stealth warships.</i>

08:14.102 --> 08:16.571
You will have to testify.

08:16.636 --> 08:18.185
Testify?

08:19.691 --> 08:22.577
To the UN Security Council.

08:22.697 --> 08:25.586
You mean the one that you and
the OPA aren't allowed into?

08:25.621 --> 08:27.005
You'll open that door for me.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.758
You want to use me to get
yourself a seat at the table?

08:29.823 --> 08:32.458
<i>It's okay to be a pawn, Holden,</i>

08:32.585 --> 08:34.095
<i>so long as you're on the right side.</i>

08:34.145 --> 08:36.308
<i>Maybe you know exactly
where those ships came from.</i>

08:36.344 --> 08:39.096
- Maybe I have no idea.
- Mmm.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.597
It's a pretty big boat
you're building out there.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.808
A small fleet of stealth
ships wouldn't be impossible.

08:43.842 --> 08:45.345
I'm not going to debate with you.

08:45.380 --> 08:47.797
We're going back to our ship now.

08:49.298 --> 08:51.407
I'm afraid you can't go back to the ship.

08:51.442 --> 08:52.936
Sounds like he doesn't like goodbyes.

08:52.986 --> 08:55.204
I'm taking control of the Tachi right now.

08:55.239 --> 08:55.761
The hell you are!

08:55.796 --> 08:56.913
- Freeze!
- Right there!

08:56.947 --> 08:58.708
<i>Those guns can't help you anymore.</i>

08:58.781 --> 09:01.413
<i>Are you sure you want to
find out if that's true?</i>

09:01.693 --> 09:04.481
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

09:04.522 --> 09:07.365
You might want to don a poncho, Holden.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.821
You don't want to test this particular guy.

09:10.856 --> 09:13.002
I've raised and buried
your kind by the hundreds.

09:13.037 --> 09:13.870
Not my kind.

09:13.905 --> 09:18.299
Broken boys, quick to the
trigger, slow on the uptake.

09:18.397 --> 09:19.614
Go ahead, son.

09:19.772 --> 09:22.591
Pull it, bullet will cut right through me,

09:22.648 --> 09:27.009
<i>but there'll be countless OPA brothers
and sisters standing behind me.</i>

09:27.204 --> 09:30.205
They will hunt you to the ends of the Belt.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.861
Holden, tell The Butcher
to call off his men,

09:37.919 --> 09:40.969
or I'll have Alex vent his bloody station.

09:48.256 --> 09:50.229
How's it going out there?

09:50.295 --> 09:53.393
<i>Um, sir,</i>

09:53.547 --> 09:55.463
<i>we have a problem.</i>

10:02.527 --> 10:05.254
What did you find at
the data broker's place?

10:05.289 --> 10:07.949
Some third-rate porn.

10:08.383 --> 10:12.750
I guess your men... I think
they got all the good stuff.

10:13.150 --> 10:16.159
Why did you go back to
Julie Mao's apartment?

10:16.518 --> 10:18.351
I'm gonna come clean.

10:19.478 --> 10:21.761
Embarrassing... But...

10:22.929 --> 10:24.716
I really like her shower.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.915
It's great water pressure.

10:28.620 --> 10:29.753
Nah, hey hey!

10:32.376 --> 10:35.480
Why do you care so much
what happened to this girl?

10:35.917 --> 10:38.552
I take my job...

10:38.916 --> 10:40.657
Very seriously.

10:40.692 --> 10:43.432
You are the station joke,

10:43.744 --> 10:45.901
I did my homework.

10:46.447 --> 10:51.585
Maybe, but Star Helix
knows I'm onto you, so...

10:51.855 --> 10:54.727
You wanna be careful how
far you wanna take this.

10:55.148 --> 10:57.506
Should be in the Black Freighter right now,

10:57.541 --> 10:59.676
buying each other rounds,

10:59.799 --> 11:01.338
talking future plans.

11:01.373 --> 11:03.220
Try it on.

11:03.255 --> 11:05.140
Your head's big enough.

11:05.810 --> 11:08.818
We are fighting for something
precious here, Miller.

11:08.853 --> 11:12.131
Sure, a fatter percentage of the docks.

11:14.234 --> 11:16.694
You even think like an Earther.

11:16.729 --> 11:19.064
You are something, man.

11:19.133 --> 11:22.623
You create a bunch of
chaos, you stir shit up

11:22.705 --> 11:23.993
so you can ride in and save the day, right?

11:24.028 --> 11:27.137
You have no idea how close we are, huh?

11:27.247 --> 11:29.113
I am talking about independence!

11:29.186 --> 11:31.817
Yeah. With you as governor.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.661
It's a great idea.

11:34.717 --> 11:39.480
You know, that <i>Scopuli</i> disaster
is a dead fish on your doorstep.

11:39.515 --> 11:41.783
You keep missing the point!

11:41.872 --> 11:45.120
That's why you gotta make
the Mao case disappear.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.882
The only question is,

11:48.584 --> 11:52.137
why you gotta sacrifice her?

11:52.249 --> 11:54.184
Son of a bitch.

11:54.219 --> 11:57.438
I can't believe I didn't see it before.

11:57.528 --> 12:00.632
Oh.

12:01.134 --> 12:03.017
Detective Miller.

12:08.391 --> 12:10.974
You're in love with Julie Mao.

12:13.394 --> 12:14.976
Yeah.

12:31.122 --> 12:32.590
Detonate already!

12:32.625 --> 12:34.763
I'm ready, I'm ready.

12:35.653 --> 12:37.287
You locked down the net?

12:37.322 --> 12:39.021
Yeah, yeah.

12:40.443 --> 12:43.209
Then why is my money floating away?

12:43.292 --> 12:44.977
<i>Sabang!</i>

12:45.063 --> 12:47.070
Stupid,
good-for-nothing rat.

12:47.105 --> 12:48.272
The net is old.

12:48.308 --> 12:50.076
By the time we secure the haul,

12:50.111 --> 12:51.825
half will be lost.

12:51.860 --> 12:55.149
I'll barely make enough to cover the trip.

12:57.489 --> 13:01.419
<i>Attention Xinglong, this
is MCRN Scipio Africanus</i>

13:01.454 --> 13:03.956
<i>power down and
prepare to be boarded.</i>

13:04.076 --> 13:06.053
Who they want?

13:08.780 --> 13:10.407
<i>Cards are on the table.</i>

13:10.504 --> 13:13.755
I provided a ship for an OPA
recon mission out of Ceres,

13:13.836 --> 13:15.378
which disappeared.

13:15.483 --> 13:17.585
The name of that ship is the Scopuli.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.182
That's right. I need this frigate
to retrieve the lone survivor.

13:21.247 --> 13:23.370
- Lionel Polanski.
- Who?

13:23.427 --> 13:26.562
It's a code name. We received
a set of coordinates from him

13:26.597 --> 13:28.774
a short time after the disaster.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.366
He would know more than anyone else about

13:30.432 --> 13:32.343
what started this and who's behind it.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.987
There's got to be another
ship you can send...

13:34.022 --> 13:35.391
I need a gunship.

13:35.426 --> 13:36.758
It's getting hot out there.

13:36.793 --> 13:39.143
And the OPA's got nothing like this.

13:39.178 --> 13:40.218
I'll pick up your operator.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.375
You're too valuable as a
witness, if you get killed...

13:42.410 --> 13:45.083
The other three saw just as much as I did.

13:45.182 --> 13:46.712
They'll stay and be your witnesses.

13:46.747 --> 13:48.220
We'll all give sworn statements.

13:48.265 --> 13:51.006
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.412
We're going to be spending a
lot of time staring at each other

13:53.447 --> 13:55.365
across the dock out there.

13:55.691 --> 13:58.680
You and I both want the same thing.

13:58.715 --> 14:00.798
To do right by our people.

14:02.905 --> 14:04.559
Let me do this.

14:04.921 --> 14:08.863
_

14:16.984 --> 14:19.317
Hands where I can see them!

14:22.748 --> 14:24.004
Transporting any weapons?

14:24.039 --> 14:26.096
No, what's the problem, <i>bosmang?</i>

14:26.131 --> 14:28.089
Show us your transponder.

14:32.668 --> 14:34.457
Says here it's expired.

14:34.495 --> 14:35.993
What happened, pebble jockey?

14:36.028 --> 14:37.964
Did you get drunk and
forget to renew your license?

14:37.999 --> 14:40.124
I didn't have the scrip,
<i>kopeng,</i> I had to replace the...

14:40.159 --> 14:43.462
Yeah, you Belters always got an excuse.

14:44.020 --> 14:46.187
We're gonna have to AO-66 you.

14:46.221 --> 14:47.540
When you arrive on Eros,

14:47.575 --> 14:50.766
your cargo will be held under lien
until your fines are paid in full.

14:50.801 --> 14:52.345
Oh, come on, there must be something...

14:52.380 --> 14:53.243
- Hey!
- Leave him alone.

14:53.278 --> 14:55.296
<i>Dzeet! Dzeet! Dzeet! Dzeet!</i>

14:55.414 --> 14:57.522
Why are you doing this?

14:57.666 --> 15:02.074
Impound our haul and there's
nothing left for your taxman.

15:02.382 --> 15:04.717
Oh, are we being too hard on you?

15:04.783 --> 15:06.801
Should we cut you a break?

15:06.836 --> 15:10.117
We are just tryin' to
feed our families, okay?

15:10.212 --> 15:12.628
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do for you...

15:14.256 --> 15:16.532
Absolutely nothing.

15:16.642 --> 15:19.527
What god gives you the
right to life's riches, huh?

15:19.624 --> 15:22.468
You set up your zones and tell
us where we can and cannot go.

15:22.503 --> 15:24.954
You living belly-full,
with your glass palaces,

15:24.989 --> 15:27.500
while half my people are starving to death.

15:27.535 --> 15:28.756
How is this justice?

15:28.791 --> 15:31.427
You Skinnies wanna take credit
for blowin' up the <i>Donnager,</i>

15:31.462 --> 15:33.660
we'll give you justice. With both hands.

15:33.695 --> 15:36.316
What are we gonna blow up the
big Martian warship with, huh?

15:36.351 --> 15:37.934
Little pebbles?

15:39.573 --> 15:41.741
Have a nice day.

15:41.844 --> 15:43.112
Oh?

15:43.213 --> 15:43.880
Hey!

15:43.915 --> 15:46.369
Leave him alone! He didn't mean...

15:46.404 --> 15:49.108
Hey. I went easy on you before.

15:49.143 --> 15:50.260
But now...

15:50.311 --> 15:53.445
You're not gonna pass through the restricted
zone on your way home, <i>"bosmain."</i>

15:53.480 --> 15:57.131
We can't go around. Not
enough fuel! We die for sure.

15:57.201 --> 15:59.968
That's your problem, not mine.

16:12.426 --> 16:14.796
How do you know what's
waiting at those coordinates?

16:14.831 --> 16:17.195
- I don't.
- Neither does Fred Johnson.

16:17.230 --> 16:21.033
And when the <i>felotas</i> hit the
fan, he will wipe his hands clean of you.

16:21.068 --> 16:23.203
That's assuming it's not a
set-up in the first place.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.827
Why would he lie about the <i>Scopuli?</i>

16:25.861 --> 16:27.703
Get himself tangled up in this mess?

16:27.738 --> 16:28.765
You're out of your ever-lovin' mind,

16:28.800 --> 16:30.081
you think you can trust that guy.

16:30.116 --> 16:31.167
Look,

16:31.364 --> 16:33.916
I only committed myself.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.445
Fred Johnson offered to crew me up.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.381
You guys'll be safe here on
Tycho till all this blows over,

16:39.416 --> 16:41.311
then you can go back to your lives.

16:41.346 --> 16:43.820
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're using his crew?

16:43.855 --> 16:45.704
How do you know he's not going to
space you the second you get out there?

16:45.739 --> 16:48.724
Because you're going to rig the <i>Roci</i>
so it only responds to my command.

16:48.787 --> 16:49.809
For God's sake.

16:49.844 --> 16:52.980
Look, I don't need to trust Fred Johnson.

16:53.075 --> 16:55.575
We both have a gun to each other's head.

16:57.525 --> 17:00.027
So, what is this?

17:00.113 --> 17:01.829
Goodbye?

17:04.294 --> 17:05.810
Nah.

17:05.924 --> 17:09.060
All that's waiting out there
for you is more trouble.

17:09.141 --> 17:12.509
More death. Why are you
so hell-bent, Holden?

17:14.391 --> 17:16.558
Because this is my fault.

17:20.069 --> 17:21.786
What is?

17:24.128 --> 17:26.762
I logged the distress
call on the <i>Cant.</i>

17:29.238 --> 17:30.904
Amos...

17:31.937 --> 17:34.152
I'm glad we cleared this up.

17:34.886 --> 17:36.551
I knew.

17:38.710 --> 17:41.494
Holden did the right thing.

17:41.753 --> 17:43.765
Why didn't you tell me?

17:43.941 --> 17:45.607
I don't know.

17:49.137 --> 17:51.170
You were afraid of me.

18:15.611 --> 18:17.744
You shoulda said somethin'.

18:28.532 --> 18:30.412
So...

18:30.576 --> 18:33.295
Let's talk about Julie Mao.

18:33.455 --> 18:34.470
Is she alive?

18:34.505 --> 18:37.358
She chose to be OPA because she believed

18:37.393 --> 18:39.892
that what we are fighting for is just.

18:39.964 --> 18:42.760
You took an innocent kid and you
forced her to do your dirty work.

18:42.795 --> 18:45.408
No! She came to me. Asked me to help her.

18:45.443 --> 18:47.634
She knew what she was doing.

18:47.775 --> 18:50.994
She was willing to make a sacrifice for us.

18:51.224 --> 18:52.412
It's more than you.

18:52.447 --> 18:53.745
She trusted you,

18:53.818 --> 18:56.121
she put herself in your hands

18:56.211 --> 18:58.744
'cause she couldn't see the blood on 'em.

19:01.783 --> 19:03.797
Just like your sister...

19:03.832 --> 19:04.904
Isn't that right?

19:04.956 --> 19:08.007
Wasn't she like 15 when you
let her die out on the Belt?

19:10.215 --> 19:13.657
Sure. It's part of the
legend you like to leave out.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.965
- Everybody knows that story...
- I doubt that.

19:17.951 --> 19:19.671
You were just stupid kids, right?

19:19.706 --> 19:21.966
Rock-hopping out on the Belt.

19:22.059 --> 19:23.583
And what,

19:23.651 --> 19:27.388
you forgot to check her
magboots or something?

19:29.105 --> 19:30.823
She was your sister.

19:30.944 --> 19:33.212
She relied on you to keep her safe.

19:33.247 --> 19:36.176
Would you like me to
tell you the real story?

19:36.211 --> 19:37.842
I'm sure you've told so many lies about it

19:37.877 --> 19:39.512
you don't even remember what happened.

19:39.547 --> 19:41.488
My sister Athena

19:41.589 --> 19:45.109
was touched by the hand of God.

19:45.199 --> 19:50.541
The most beautiful child in
all the Belt, the smartest.

19:50.715 --> 19:53.212
But she was fragile.

19:54.309 --> 19:57.395
Her bones were like chalk

19:57.430 --> 20:01.884
from spending a lifetime in Zero-g.

20:02.530 --> 20:05.699
She was never going to recover.

20:05.812 --> 20:11.382
An impossible burden for a
dirt-poor family of rock-hoppers.

20:12.180 --> 20:16.616
And when she became too
ill even to travel...

20:18.503 --> 20:21.998
I had three other sisters to think about.

20:24.130 --> 20:26.962
Our family was starving...

20:29.059 --> 20:30.975
So, you killed her...

20:32.304 --> 20:34.996
And that makes me a monster.

20:36.238 --> 20:38.540
There was no scrip to bury her,

20:38.614 --> 20:40.248
so I laid her to rest

20:40.283 --> 20:45.314
in a beautiful bauxite tunnel
that we discovered together.

20:47.110 --> 20:50.945
Do you know it is possible to

20:51.650 --> 20:54.644
cry so hard

20:54.972 --> 20:58.627
that your tears turn to blood?

21:02.994 --> 21:05.296
And living with this pain,

21:05.393 --> 21:09.261
I came to realize that I have millions

21:09.296 --> 21:13.722
of brothers and sisters in the Belt.

21:14.089 --> 21:17.249
I even count you among them.

21:17.629 --> 21:21.437
As I did Julie, an Earther.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.700
So, everybody dies for the cause,

21:26.374 --> 21:28.006
except for you.

21:29.933 --> 21:32.828
Now I'll tell you the truth about Julie.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.998
Just tell me if she's alive.

21:36.527 --> 21:39.612
If she was here right now,

21:40.936 --> 21:43.747
she'd spit in your face.

21:45.273 --> 21:48.125
You're everything she despised.

21:48.214 --> 21:51.136
A Belter who preys on his own kind.

21:51.171 --> 21:53.004
<i>Welwala...</i>

21:54.974 --> 21:56.991
Die as you lived.

22:04.147 --> 22:06.472
<i>That every drop of water on Ceres</i>

22:06.507 --> 22:10.284
<i>has been blood, and
piss and tears and spit,</i>

22:10.342 --> 22:13.845
<i>a hundred times and will
be a thousand times more.</i>

22:13.880 --> 22:16.994
<i>The innocent can
never comprehend this.</i>

22:17.029 --> 22:19.581
<i>Perhaps, they will
comprehend the hail of stones</i>

22:19.616 --> 22:24.397
<i>that will one day come crashing down
through their precious blue skies.</i>

22:24.603 --> 22:28.348
<i>You want us to call you
Sir and Madam, and grovel,</i>

22:28.383 --> 22:31.149
<i>like we are some
second-class citizens.</i>

22:31.184 --> 22:32.970
<i>Well, enjoy your final days in...</i>

22:35.618 --> 22:38.304
<i>...the stars belong to Belters,</i>

22:38.339 --> 22:40.057
<i>the heavens belong to Belters...</i>

22:40.092 --> 22:42.360
Uncle, what are you doing?

22:42.395 --> 22:43.856
What are you doing?

22:43.921 --> 22:46.021
Uncle Mateo, no!

22:46.283 --> 22:48.372
No! No, no, no!

22:48.407 --> 22:51.386
Go on! Go!

22:52.077 --> 22:53.445
- No!
- Get out!

22:53.480 --> 22:55.729
Please! I'll try harder!

22:58.876 --> 23:01.576
I'm sorry. I'll work harder!

23:03.990 --> 23:08.025
Please! I'm sorry!

23:09.010 --> 23:10.667
No!

23:10.702 --> 23:12.618
What are you doing?

23:21.434 --> 23:23.926
<i>Please. Uncle, please!</i>

23:23.961 --> 23:26.329
<i>Please!</i>

23:26.460 --> 23:30.495
<i>Uncle! Please!</i>

23:38.398 --> 23:41.191
<i>Carlos Davila just reamed
me out for half an hour.</i>

23:41.226 --> 23:44.061
He's a private citizen, Chrisjen,
you can't go squeezing his berries.

23:44.096 --> 23:47.792
I politely asked to
borrow his spy on Tycho.

23:47.895 --> 23:49.579
Why are you interested in Fred Johnson?

23:49.614 --> 23:52.701
He has blood on his hands
and wants redemption.

23:52.736 --> 23:56.010
While Earth and Mars throw
sand in each other's faces,

23:56.045 --> 23:58.050
the OPA rises in the Belt.

23:58.085 --> 23:59.627
Tycho spins up asteroids.

23:59.732 --> 24:02.404
The <i>Donnager</i> was destroyed
by advanced stealth warships.

24:02.439 --> 24:07.279
And Fred Johnson is building the
largest spacecraft in human history.

24:07.314 --> 24:10.401
He'd have to be siphoning off
resources on a massive scale.

24:10.436 --> 24:12.652
The OPA smuggler we captured

24:12.697 --> 24:15.052
was carrying stealth composites.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.254
That's not a coincidence.

24:18.581 --> 24:21.083
Are you going to shut me down?

24:21.234 --> 24:23.952
Fred Johnson turned his back on Earth.

24:24.009 --> 24:26.259
The OPA killed your son.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.474
You sure this isn't personal?

24:29.265 --> 24:32.143
You're damn right it's personal.

24:33.068 --> 24:34.901
All right.

24:37.245 --> 24:39.347
You keep me in the loop.

24:39.429 --> 24:41.128
Of course.

25:11.763 --> 25:12.986
I'm Daniel.

25:13.021 --> 25:15.471
I'm not interested, Daniel.

25:17.004 --> 25:20.474
Tell me. How do they treat you here?

25:20.789 --> 25:23.289
The others say it's better than most.

25:24.145 --> 25:27.064
That bucker, ogling you?

25:27.099 --> 25:30.035
He's packing a knife on his left hip.

25:30.116 --> 25:31.865
Thanks.

25:42.036 --> 25:44.455
What are you, their union rep?

25:44.598 --> 25:47.154
I grew up in places like this.

25:47.881 --> 25:51.465
You grew up? I wouldn't have figured that.

25:52.495 --> 25:53.713
Must've been rough.

25:53.748 --> 25:55.788
Ah, it's fine.

25:55.990 --> 25:57.301
I guess you must have been as happy

25:57.336 --> 26:00.108
as a puppy with two peckers, right?

26:00.143 --> 26:02.244
I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.

26:02.380 --> 26:03.913
Like what?

26:04.812 --> 26:07.761
I'm going to stop
talking. Two more, please!

26:08.807 --> 26:11.348
It's an honest living.

26:11.398 --> 26:13.866
It's more honest than most.

26:13.995 --> 26:18.015
And you can tell a lot about a
place by how they treat their people.

26:18.323 --> 26:20.356
Fair enough.

26:23.213 --> 26:25.774
Why don't you spend some scrip?

26:26.310 --> 26:28.878
Go on, it'd be good for you.

26:28.913 --> 26:31.215
- Ah, I can't.
- Oh, come on!

26:31.432 --> 26:33.432
You're not married.

26:37.125 --> 26:38.759
What makes you say that?

26:38.887 --> 26:41.953
Like I said, I grew up in places like this.

26:43.621 --> 26:46.007
I was married.

26:46.041 --> 26:49.208
Out on a run, all I could think
about was getting back home.

26:50.224 --> 26:54.826
And lying in my bed,
all I could dream about

26:54.861 --> 26:56.829
was getting back out here.

26:56.961 --> 26:59.838
Big brass said I didn't
have what it takes to

26:59.873 --> 27:02.533
fly their badass gun-ships...

27:02.854 --> 27:07.932
But I'll tell you one thing, flying
the <i>Rocinante</i> back there,

27:07.998 --> 27:12.763
that was just about the
best feeling I have ever had.

27:27.665 --> 27:29.531
I'll do it.

27:32.488 --> 27:35.280
The ship will look like a
run-of-the-mill gas freighter.

27:35.315 --> 27:38.467
Don't fly too close, but
don't try to avoid it.

27:38.518 --> 27:40.353
The Martian patrols won't
give you a second look.

27:40.388 --> 27:43.188
- The drive signature?
- We're altering that too.

27:45.800 --> 27:49.542
A lot of Martians gave their
lives getting us onto this ship.

27:50.008 --> 27:51.893
In the heat of the battle...

27:51.989 --> 27:54.655
They fought to get you
off the <i>Donnager?</i>

27:55.994 --> 27:57.098
Wow...

27:57.133 --> 27:58.828
Are there any bodies
we need to take care of?

27:58.863 --> 28:01.947
Lieutenant Lopez. He's in the rear hold.

28:04.025 --> 28:06.043
He died for us.

28:06.116 --> 28:08.531
I'll make sure his body
is returned to Mars.

28:08.596 --> 28:11.013
- He's a fellow soldier.
- Thank you.

28:19.344 --> 28:21.226
You all right?

28:23.327 --> 28:27.631
Relax. You rigged the fail-safe, right?

28:27.846 --> 28:30.181
They try to access any
areas that they shouldn't,

28:30.216 --> 28:33.367
and the <i>Roci's</i>
core will self-destruct.

28:35.241 --> 28:37.617
I'm confident you got us covered.

28:37.721 --> 28:39.804
You feeling confident?

28:39.959 --> 28:44.597
Come on, let's let them do their thing and
we'll go get a drink in the crew lounge.

28:45.194 --> 28:46.745
You sure?

28:46.973 --> 28:49.102
I could use a drink.

28:49.171 --> 28:51.554
We'll charge it to Fred's tab.

30:15.221 --> 30:17.964
<i>Uncle Mateo! Please!</i>

30:18.083 --> 30:19.192
<i>You don't need to do this!</i>

30:19.227 --> 30:21.446
A man's gotta stand up.

30:24.951 --> 30:26.464
<i>Uncle Mateo!</i>

30:26.518 --> 30:29.477
A man has got to stand up!

30:29.692 --> 30:31.609
<i>Come back!</i>

30:32.769 --> 30:34.162
<i>We'll be okay.</i>

30:34.197 --> 30:35.708
We can only live so long...

30:35.743 --> 30:38.569
<i>With a boot to our necks!</i>

30:38.682 --> 30:40.700
Uncle Mateo!

30:40.821 --> 30:44.802
You don't need to do this! We'll be okay!

30:44.890 --> 30:47.780
Xinglong, <i>you are on
unauthorized intercept course.</i>

30:47.815 --> 30:49.850
- <i>Adjust trajectory immediately...</i>
- It's okay, Diogo.

30:49.885 --> 30:52.583
- <i>Someone will find you out there.</i>
- We'll be okay!

30:52.658 --> 30:55.002
Someday, things gonna change.

30:55.037 --> 30:58.071
<i>We'll be okay, Uncle. We'll be okay!</i>

30:58.106 --> 31:00.189
A man's gotta stand up.

31:42.783 --> 31:44.449
To Shed.

31:47.469 --> 31:48.703
Always generous.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.277
Mmm.

31:50.312 --> 31:52.544
Thoughtful...

31:52.687 --> 31:54.372
Sometimes, a whiny little prick.

31:57.895 --> 31:59.746
We're going to miss you, pal.

31:59.842 --> 32:02.036
Wherever you are,

32:02.812 --> 32:03.489
I hope no one there

32:03.524 --> 32:06.393
needs medical attention.

32:06.427 --> 32:08.176
<i>Yam seng!</i>

32:11.061 --> 32:12.560
Mmm.

32:13.973 --> 32:18.391
To those brave, crazy bastards
who got us off the <i>Donnager.</i>

32:19.709 --> 32:21.299
Hey.

32:22.039 --> 32:24.001
A little respect.

32:24.111 --> 32:25.662
I have nothing but respect.

32:25.697 --> 32:27.580
Then what's your problem?

32:28.879 --> 32:31.711
Gung-ho military hypnotized by a uniform,

32:31.785 --> 32:34.403
fanatics, religious freaks.

32:34.463 --> 32:36.769
<i>Those Marines could've
saved themselves,</i>

32:36.804 --> 32:38.721
<i>gone home to their families,</i>

32:38.756 --> 32:41.018
instead of coming back for us.

32:41.947 --> 32:44.215
Yeah.

32:44.445 --> 32:46.931
Well, it did take some convincing...

32:49.165 --> 32:51.417
I know it was because of you.

32:54.376 --> 32:56.459
<i>Why did you come back for us?</i>

32:59.493 --> 33:01.432
Well, you were only there because of me.

33:01.529 --> 33:03.028
Mmm.

33:04.644 --> 33:06.779
Why?

33:07.001 --> 33:08.877
Would you have come back for me?

33:08.956 --> 33:11.990
At the time? With all those bullets flying?

33:15.589 --> 33:18.556
Probably not.

33:23.780 --> 33:26.449
So, what's next for Naomi Nagata?

33:26.546 --> 33:28.796
When all this blows over?

33:32.049 --> 33:33.997
<i>Nawe Nada.</i>

33:34.565 --> 33:36.395
I'm using my last remaining brain cells,

33:36.469 --> 33:39.260
to try and kill my last
remaining brain cells.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.686
So let's get to work on that, shall we?

34:00.979 --> 34:02.728
I got it.

34:04.813 --> 34:07.267
I never killed anyone before.

34:07.334 --> 34:09.313
Right...

34:09.349 --> 34:11.181
You'll be all right.

34:12.626 --> 34:15.696
Ugh. I'm gonna be sick.

34:16.065 --> 34:18.447
Oh...

34:20.284 --> 34:22.728
Hey, you're all right.

34:22.764 --> 34:24.547
It's just a reaction.

34:27.591 --> 34:31.650
You know, my third year on the job,

34:32.234 --> 34:34.699
I caught this Skinny,

34:34.795 --> 34:35.748
he was from the Lower Levels.

34:35.783 --> 34:39.159
He was coming out of a drug-den,

34:41.225 --> 34:43.395
he grabbed his old lady by the hair,

34:43.495 --> 34:45.197
he was waving his piece around.

34:45.286 --> 34:46.985
Drink.

34:48.222 --> 34:49.755
And, um...

34:50.761 --> 34:53.263
You know how they tell you in basic,

34:53.438 --> 34:56.475
you're either somebody who can
pull the trigger or you ain't.

34:56.545 --> 34:57.920
Well,

34:59.196 --> 35:01.279
you and me are the same.

35:02.328 --> 35:04.463
First shot,

35:04.537 --> 35:06.453
I killed him, all right.

35:08.148 --> 35:12.449
But it wasn't the blood or the
iron smell of it that got me.

35:15.352 --> 35:18.955
It was that little girl in the window,

35:19.138 --> 35:20.754
watching me.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.163
You know...

35:29.812 --> 35:31.945
The only guy I ever killed...

35:34.776 --> 35:37.911
You know, every time
you remember something,

35:38.016 --> 35:40.896
your mind changes it, just a little,

35:41.603 --> 35:45.709
until your best and your worst memories,

35:47.932 --> 35:50.533
they're your biggest illusions.

35:51.118 --> 35:54.276
My advice is just forget it.

35:55.004 --> 35:57.003
Make yourself forget it.

35:59.104 --> 36:01.148
I appreciate that,

36:01.775 --> 36:03.775
but it's terrible advice.

36:04.808 --> 36:06.596
Yeah, probably.

36:25.967 --> 36:27.717
Um...

36:32.962 --> 36:34.745
What are you doing?

36:41.936 --> 36:45.159
Found this at Julie's.

36:45.769 --> 36:47.435
Let's see what's on it.

37:07.301 --> 37:08.968
You're late.

37:11.153 --> 37:13.510
- What is this?
- Oh, spare us the speech.

37:13.592 --> 37:15.258
The ship's ready.

37:16.869 --> 37:18.910
Are you?

37:19.009 --> 37:20.747
I guess we lost Amos.

37:20.805 --> 37:23.139
Oh, he'll be here in a sec.

37:24.905 --> 37:26.570
Okay.

37:28.336 --> 37:31.587
I guess I'll put on some coffee.

37:36.595 --> 37:38.262
You people drive a hard bargain.

37:38.296 --> 37:40.596
You got our recorded statements.

37:42.175 --> 37:46.095
We'll bring your Lionel
Polanski home, if he's out there.

37:46.138 --> 37:49.774
In return, I want you
to help me find someone.

37:49.981 --> 37:52.459
Someday, I'll come to you with a name.

37:52.585 --> 37:54.901
No questions asked.

37:55.571 --> 37:57.620
I'll do what I can.

38:14.221 --> 38:19.254
_

38:28.180 --> 38:31.065
Jesus, Miller. Should I even ask?

38:31.099 --> 38:32.848
I figured it out...

38:34.519 --> 38:36.654
Most of it, anyway.

38:36.688 --> 38:37.952
Here...

38:38.065 --> 38:41.057
<i>It's not dormant,
it's giving off heat.</i>

38:41.092 --> 38:42.849
<i>I'm seeing molecular reactions...</i>

38:42.884 --> 38:45.760
<i>Vibrational resonances
all across the spectrum...</i>

38:45.795 --> 38:46.970
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

38:47.005 --> 38:48.054
Look at this thing.

38:48.089 --> 38:49.327
What the hell am I looking at?

38:49.362 --> 38:53.581
You're looking at, I don't
know, some kind of bio-weapon?

38:53.850 --> 38:55.231
Where'd this recording come from?

38:55.266 --> 38:56.429
Phoebe, that's what I think.

38:56.464 --> 38:58.349
- Phoebe Station.
- I meant where'd you get it?

38:58.384 --> 39:00.018
Julie Mao.

39:00.053 --> 39:01.968
She bought that from a data-broker.

39:02.034 --> 39:03.623
She gave it to Dawes.

39:03.715 --> 39:06.193
Dawes crewed up this black-bag ship

39:06.275 --> 39:09.244
which vanishes with all souls aboard.

39:09.301 --> 39:12.142
And then, the data-broker ends up dead,

39:12.177 --> 39:14.303
and ships start blowing up.

39:14.377 --> 39:16.545
We know who's pulling the strings?

39:16.626 --> 39:18.784
Well, let's play it through.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.756
Scientists on Phoebe discover something,

39:20.814 --> 39:23.949
something big that would
tip the balance of power.

39:23.984 --> 39:27.894
The OPA gets wind of it, they
send a crew out to steal it.

39:27.963 --> 39:29.680
The mission goes south.

39:29.760 --> 39:31.482
Which leaves

39:32.357 --> 39:35.126
someone with a lot of power,

39:35.161 --> 39:38.964
a lot of resources, who'll
do anything to keep it quiet.

39:38.999 --> 39:42.997
Including starting a war.

39:43.729 --> 39:47.148
And that man... He holds the key.

39:47.292 --> 39:49.821
<i>Radiation levels are
off the charts...</i>

39:50.504 --> 39:53.223
<i>We're ready for the next phase.</i>

39:53.343 --> 39:55.759
<i>We need to get a sample off Phoebe,</i>

39:57.261 --> 39:59.061
<i>now!</i>

40:00.595 --> 40:02.198
You tell anyone about this?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.636
No. Just you.

40:03.671 --> 40:06.920
What about this? Copies?

40:07.266 --> 40:08.935
No. It's encrypted.

40:08.970 --> 40:12.552
You can't copy it.

40:16.540 --> 40:19.648
Erase Detective Miller's case
files and cancel all his clearances.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.716
What are you doing?

40:22.738 --> 40:24.404
You're fired.

40:27.363 --> 40:29.999
Dawes...

40:30.135 --> 40:31.621
He bought you.

40:31.656 --> 40:33.363
Get out.

40:33.398 --> 40:35.583
You're in his pocket.

40:35.764 --> 40:37.816
What, did he buy himself
a whole police force?

40:37.851 --> 40:38.882
Have it your way.

40:38.945 --> 40:40.527
Security.

40:40.562 --> 40:44.999
What does it go for these
days, huh? Undying loyalty?

40:45.033 --> 40:47.785
I'm tired of speaking to a child.

40:47.914 --> 40:49.982
Yeah, well, I'm tired
of smelling this shit.

40:50.017 --> 40:52.268
You know that?

40:52.489 --> 40:54.912
Help Mr. Miller find the door.

40:54.993 --> 40:58.148
If he gives you any problems,
feel free to shoot him.

41:27.543 --> 41:29.259
I'm sorry.

41:38.703 --> 41:40.252
Thanks.

41:47.726 --> 41:50.013
Tycho Control, this is
gas-freighter <i>Rocinante</i>

41:50.048 --> 41:51.779
requesting clearance for departure.

41:51.814 --> 41:55.227
<i>Understood,</i> Rocinante, <i>your
flight plan has been filed and logged.</i>

41:55.262 --> 41:57.948
<i>Be advised you'll be crossing
three Martian trade zones.</i>

41:57.983 --> 42:00.774
<i>Likelihood of encountering
MCRN patrols is high.</i>

42:00.832 --> 42:03.757
<i>Sorry, that's the best we could
do. You are clear to disengage.</i>

42:03.792 --> 42:05.387
Thank you kindly, partner.
