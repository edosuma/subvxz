WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:02.785
<i>Previously onChesapeake Shores ...</i>

00:02.828 --> 00:03.829
We could be pregnant
right now.

00:03.873 --> 00:05.483
We could be.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.094
- I spent 17 years as a curator

00:07.137 --> 00:08.747
at the MET in New York, and--

00:08.791 --> 00:10.923
I just want the world
to know about your work!

00:10.967 --> 00:12.273
If your father is innocent,

00:12.316 --> 00:13.361
then you shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

00:13.404 --> 00:14.753
Do you have a lock
on that drawer?

00:14.797 --> 00:16.364
Yeah, but I don't have
a key yet.

00:16.407 --> 00:19.062
You might not want to leave
any documents sitting around.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.324
Have you seen my car keys?

00:20.368 --> 00:21.891
I was just wondering
if everything's okay.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.284
I appreciate you caring...

00:23.327 --> 00:24.763
and do me a favor--
keep it between you and me--

00:24.807 --> 00:26.678
just until I figure
this whole thing out.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.556
Ah, another
Chesapeake Shores Day

00:34.599 --> 00:35.774
is upon us this weekend,

00:35.818 --> 00:37.733
and the O'Briens
are out in force.

00:37.776 --> 00:38.908
We wouldn't want to be
anywhere else.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.214
I'm glad you're here.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.303
Your family is the backbone
of this community.

00:42.346 --> 00:43.565
That's nice.

00:43.608 --> 00:44.609
He's the mayor.
It's an election year.

00:44.653 --> 00:45.828
He says that to every family.

00:45.871 --> 00:46.698
- No...
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.485
O'Brien,
don't reach up so high.

00:50.528 --> 00:52.226
I've been helping to build
these booths for 40 years.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.140
I think I know what I'm doing.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.358
40 years, huh?

00:54.402 --> 00:56.491
Exactly my point.

00:56.534 --> 00:57.448
Maybe it's time
to let someone else

00:57.492 --> 00:58.971
risk their life up there.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.973
I like to live dangerously.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.366
Hey, hand me
an Allen wrench, will you?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.107
Yeah, happy to.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.284
Gee... which wrench
is named Allen?

01:07.328 --> 01:08.459
Kidding,

01:08.503 --> 01:11.027
but I don't see one.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
That's because
it's a Gracie Allen wrench.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.465
That's actually pretty good.

01:14.509 --> 01:15.510
You're trying to get me
down from that ladder,

01:15.553 --> 01:16.380
aren't you?

01:16.424 --> 01:17.338
It worked, didn't it?

01:17.381 --> 01:18.252
Yup.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.558
Mick O'Brien?

01:20.602 --> 01:21.559
Yes?

01:21.603 --> 01:22.386
Could I have a word with you?

01:22.430 --> 01:23.735
What can I do for you?

01:23.779 --> 01:25.085
In private?

01:25.128 --> 01:26.912
Anything you have to say
you can say right here.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.394
All right, Mandrake
will be here any minute

01:30.438 --> 01:31.352
to take us to the site.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.527
That is great.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.006
We have so many
decisions to make.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.617
This is such a charming town.

01:35.660 --> 01:36.879
We like it.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.533
I've decided to stay a while.

01:38.576 --> 01:39.882
See the project started.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.405
Ah, well, we couldn't
do it without you.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.711
Oh, no, wait, we can.

01:42.754 --> 01:43.581
Ah...

01:43.625 --> 01:45.017
Ooh.

01:45.061 --> 01:47.629
I bought a little bungalow
out on Quander Road,

01:47.672 --> 01:49.152
but it's not quite ready yet,

01:49.196 --> 01:50.545
so I'm looking for
a place to stay for the night.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.024
Any recommendations?

01:52.068 --> 01:53.939
Well, there's lots
of great places in Baltimore.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.463
That's over an hour away.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.160
You catch on quick.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.509
Choosing to ignore that.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.032
I was thinking a B&B.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.034
This Inn at Eagle Point
sounds nice.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.210
Oh, yeah?

02:03.253 --> 02:05.560
Huh, says the proprietor
is Jess O'Brien.

02:05.603 --> 02:06.778
Any relation?

02:06.822 --> 02:07.649
She is my sister,

02:07.692 --> 02:09.172
but you already knew that.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.260
Mandrake did some research.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.348
Mm-hmm.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.654
Yeah, I think I'll stay here.

02:12.697 --> 02:13.829
Why?

02:13.872 --> 02:15.439
'Cause it looks like
a nice place,

02:15.483 --> 02:17.180
has good Yelp reviews.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.877
Checking in
on the competition?

02:18.921 --> 02:20.227
Now, does that sound like me?

02:20.270 --> 02:21.097
I really don't know.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.098
Hmm.

02:22.142 --> 02:22.925
Mandrake!

02:22.968 --> 02:24.361
There you are.

02:24.405 --> 02:25.928
I was unexpectedly
detained by traffic, sir.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.408
Apparently, there's a thing
called Chesapeake Shores Day

02:27.451 --> 02:28.452
going on.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.062
So I've heard.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.158
Oh... hey!

02:40.769 --> 02:43.032
Never mind.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.513
What was Sarah doing
coming out of Dr. Baum's office?

02:45.556 --> 02:47.123
- The OBGYN?
- Yep.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.169
Maybe she has news.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.954
Well, I'm sure
she'll tell us in time.

02:51.997 --> 02:54.217
Ah, the Grover family!

02:54.261 --> 02:56.001
I'm glad you're here.

02:56.045 --> 03:00.354
Your family is the backbone
of Chesapeake Shores.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.837
Hi.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.231
Is something wrong?

03:08.275 --> 03:10.451
We just got paid a visit
by a lawyer.

03:10.494 --> 03:11.887
Your dad's being sued.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.454
Sued by Paul Dilpher.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.412
He's saying that the fraud
is all Mick's fault.

03:15.456 --> 03:16.761
Guess who's representing him?

03:16.805 --> 03:18.850
I know.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.896
My firm.

03:26.206 --> 03:32.690

04:26.048 --> 04:27.441
They're trying to scare you.

04:27.484 --> 04:31.271
All they're doing
is making me angry.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.447
You didn't know
anything about this, right?

04:33.490 --> 04:34.796
No, they're keeping me away

04:34.839 --> 04:36.188
from anything
to do with Dilpher.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.581
A firewall?

04:37.625 --> 04:38.843
Yes.

04:39.975 --> 04:43.239
Now, here's what you don't know.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.936
We have proof,

04:44.980 --> 04:46.547
actual proof

04:46.590 --> 04:49.289
that Dilpher forged
your signature

04:49.332 --> 04:51.856
on several contracts.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.121
What are we going to do
with that information?

04:56.165 --> 04:58.298
Abby and I have a plan.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.516
Which is?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.301
We haven't worked out
all the details yet,

05:01.344 --> 05:03.215
but trust me
when I say this, Dad...

05:04.608 --> 05:05.870
we're gonna get him.

05:10.658 --> 05:11.615
I'm just saying,

05:11.659 --> 05:13.487
having Evan Kincaid stay here

05:13.530 --> 05:14.923
just might not be
the best idea.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.141
Too late.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.012
Someone from his office
already called

05:17.055 --> 05:17.882
and reserved a room.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.536
I'm looking forward to it.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.016
I read his interview
in "Vanity Fair".

05:21.059 --> 05:22.191
He's really witty.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.106
Ah... yeah, maybe,

05:24.149 --> 05:26.500
but I'm telling you,
he's so high maintenance.

05:26.543 --> 05:29.285
Well, I'm used to dealing
with people like that.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.113
That's my family,
for better or worse.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.114
Well, I have to admit,

05:32.157 --> 05:33.507
I'm not crazy about him building

05:33.550 --> 05:35.944
some fancy-schmancy hotel
in town.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.206
What if it hurts our business?

05:37.249 --> 05:39.121
I think it's gonna
help our business.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.296
Anything that makes
Chesapeake Shores

05:40.340 --> 05:41.993
a more attractive vacation spot.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.256
It's a win-win.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.649
But good use
of "fancy-schmancy".

05:45.693 --> 05:47.651
Thank you.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.218
His magazine photo?

05:49.261 --> 05:50.262
Very handsome.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.525
Handsome?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.831
I mean...
maybe he's got a nice face,

05:53.875 --> 05:56.094
but I'm telling you,
he will drive you crazy.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.619
But at least
I have a nice face.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.753
- Hi, I'm Evan.
- Hi! I'm Jess O'Brien.

06:02.797 --> 06:05.277
This is my fiancé, David Peck.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.148
Nice to meet you.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.497
Your place is beautiful.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.542
Thank you.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.892
And what
is that incredible smell?

06:10.935 --> 06:13.416
I am making
some handmade tortellini.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.635
Oh.

06:14.678 --> 06:15.766
Room for one more?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.028
Absolutely.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.552
Great.

06:19.683 --> 06:22.207
Hi, Abby.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.383
You're awfully quiet.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.777
It's hard to talk
with your foot in your mouth.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.388
Don't give it
a second thought.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.346
I like that you call 'em
like you see 'em.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.392
Okay, now, when I said
"drives you crazy,"

06:32.435 --> 06:33.654
what I meant was...

06:33.697 --> 06:35.090
Challenging?

06:35.133 --> 06:36.526
Or annoying.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.614
Let's go with challenging.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.050
So you two
are tying the knot, huh?

06:39.094 --> 06:40.182
Congrats.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.444
I wish you nothing
but happiness.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.445
Thank you.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.664
Are you married?

06:43.707 --> 06:45.143
Mm-mm, no.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.928
I have not been able
to make that one work.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.146
I guess I'm too...

06:48.190 --> 06:49.713
-"Challenging?"
- Not the word they used,

06:49.757 --> 06:50.584
but sure.

06:52.150 --> 06:53.761
So, won't you stay and join us
for some tortellini?

06:53.804 --> 06:54.936
Oh, I would love to,

06:54.979 --> 06:56.459
but I have this
demanding client

06:56.503 --> 06:58.418
who keeps me busy
all the time.

06:58.461 --> 06:59.288
Must drive you crazy.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.245
You have no idea.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.422
- Bye!
- Bye.

07:05.033 --> 07:07.035
So I read over your prospectus

07:07.078 --> 07:08.428
for the class you're teaching
in the fall.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.472
Yeah, what did you think?

07:09.516 --> 07:10.778
I like it a lot.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.170
It's very creative.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.781
I think it's just
what the program needs.

07:13.824 --> 07:14.695
That's great.

07:14.738 --> 07:15.826
It's, uh...

07:15.870 --> 07:17.001
it's only missing one thing.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.002
Oh. What?

07:18.046 --> 07:19.482
A name.

07:19.526 --> 07:22.006
A class needs a catchy name
in the course catalog.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.921
Something that will
grab the kids' attention.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.357
That's interesting.

07:25.401 --> 07:26.620
I didn't think you needed
to worry about marketing

07:26.663 --> 07:27.969
in academia.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.319
Ah, I remember
when I was that naive.

07:30.362 --> 07:31.363
We should have dinner sometime,

07:31.407 --> 07:32.452
and I'll tell you about it.

07:32.495 --> 07:33.757
Dinner?

07:33.801 --> 07:36.630
Or lunch, or a coffee.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.327
Don't worry,
it's not a date,

07:39.981 --> 07:41.069
I wasn't worried.

08:08.357 --> 08:09.619
Margaret!

08:09.663 --> 08:10.838
Margaret, hey...

08:10.881 --> 08:12.535
Um, I was thinking
about what you said

08:12.579 --> 08:14.145
the other day.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.886
Really? What did I say?

08:15.930 --> 08:18.541
You implied that someone
was going through my desk.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.934
Doesn't sound like
something I would say,

08:19.977 --> 08:22.763
but if someone is going
through your desk,

08:22.806 --> 08:24.329
and you know that,

08:24.373 --> 08:26.854
it seems that you're in control
of what they find,

08:26.897 --> 08:28.769
aren't you?

08:37.647 --> 08:38.648
Morning.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.175
Hey, Bree.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.307
Luke, hi!

08:45.350 --> 08:46.395
Hey.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.483
Hey, did you take that job?

08:47.527 --> 08:48.832
I did.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.051
On your advice.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.574
That's great.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.488
Do you want to sit?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.272
Sure, for a minute,

08:54.316 --> 08:55.317
if I'm not interrupting.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.666
No, not at all.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.320
It's just my lesson plan.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.149
I'm supposed to teach
college kids

09:01.192 --> 09:03.107
how to write
the stories of their lives.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.327
And my head of department

09:05.370 --> 09:07.198
wants me to come up with
a catchy name for it,

09:07.242 --> 09:08.504
so, um...

09:08.548 --> 09:10.071
Hmm, how about this,

09:10.114 --> 09:11.768
"My Life And Easy Times."

09:11.812 --> 09:14.162
Oh, that's not bad.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.120
"Memoirs of a Graduate Student,
Part One?"

09:16.164 --> 09:17.861
Accurate, but kinda boring.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.559
Oh.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.299
How about, "That's My Story,
and I'm Sticking To It?"

09:21.343 --> 09:23.388
A little defensive.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.347
Yeah, I have that problem.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.262
"A Novel Approach
to Writing Your Life."

09:27.305 --> 09:28.785
That's good.

09:28.829 --> 09:32.223
Or "A Novel Approach to Self."

09:32.267 --> 09:34.878
That... is not bad.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.663
You have hidden depths.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.534
Yeah, well,
I have to blend in

09:38.578 --> 09:40.231
due to the sensitive nature
of my work.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.368
Are you a spy?

09:46.411 --> 09:49.327
Okay, we prefer
to use the term "operative,"

09:49.371 --> 09:51.503
but I think I've said
too much already.

09:51.547 --> 09:52.592
You know what,
I've always said

09:52.635 --> 09:54.419
that Chesapeake Shores
was a hotbed

09:54.463 --> 09:55.769
of international intrigue,

09:55.812 --> 09:57.335
but nobody ever believed me.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.729
Yes, you know, this place
is actually an information drop

09:59.773 --> 10:01.818
for the KGB.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.691
That explains
why Sally is so elusive.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.475
But I thought the KGB
was no more?

10:06.518 --> 10:08.912
You know too much.

10:08.956 --> 10:09.957
Give me your number

10:10.000 --> 10:10.958
in case
I have to tap your phone.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.916
Fun.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.660
Well, this conversation
never happened.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.096
What conversation?

10:26.713 --> 10:28.410
And they didn't tell you
anything more?

10:28.453 --> 10:29.890
Nope,

10:29.933 --> 10:31.282
but I think I'm being spied on.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.501
What makes you think that?

10:32.544 --> 10:34.285
One of the paralegals told me.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.939
Well, she implied it.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.594
I think she was saying...

10:38.638 --> 10:39.726
I don't know
what she was saying,

10:39.769 --> 10:41.858
She can kind of be
a confusing person.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.033
But she's trying to help you?

10:43.077 --> 10:44.165
She is.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.906
I have calls
into other builders

10:45.949 --> 10:47.037
who worked with Dilpher
in the past.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.039
I asked them
to pull up old contracts

10:49.083 --> 10:50.954
to see if they notice
any discrepancies.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.695
People will just go
and pull files for you?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.044
Not for me.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.916
They're doing it for you, Dad.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.613
Mick O'Brien's reputation
is gold.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.616
Used to be.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.705
Now I'm being sued
for criminal negligence.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.228
We're going to
figure this out.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.360
If Dilpher did this to you,

11:05.403 --> 11:06.796
he probably did it
to other builders.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.146
Now, we only have
two days until the deposition,

11:09.190 --> 11:10.800
which doesn't give us
much time to prepare.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.585
Well, we'd better get to it.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.676
They should know better
than to mess with the O'Briens.

11:26.381 --> 11:27.991
David, this is so good.

11:28.035 --> 11:29.776
Thank you.

11:29.819 --> 11:31.952
You know, I made this
at the firehouse.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.518
That was this?

11:33.562 --> 11:35.216
There's no way
you gave me the same recipe.

11:35.259 --> 11:38.262
Yeah, I may have left out
a couple ingredients.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.394
I knew it.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.442
I kind of feel sorry for him.

11:44.486 --> 11:45.748
What?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.837
Oh, no, he's fine.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.186
I bet he loves some alone time.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.405
He's around people all day.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.407
Hmm, I don't know.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.758
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.239
I just wanted to say
my compliments to the chef.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.457
Do you want to join us?

11:59.501 --> 12:02.025
Oh, no, no,
I wouldn't want to intrude.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.200
Okay.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.158
Well, if you insist.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.072
Okay.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.465
Hi!

12:07.509 --> 12:08.945
I am Evan.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.033
Hey. Kevin O'Brien,

12:10.077 --> 12:11.295
This is my wife, Sarah.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.601
Hi.
Wow, another O'Brien.

12:12.644 --> 12:13.950
How many of you are there?

12:13.994 --> 12:15.125
There's a few more of us.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.692
Amazing.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.781
So, Kevin, what are
your interests?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.000
I'm sorry.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.784
Is this okay?

12:21.828 --> 12:23.307
Yeah.
Yes, it is.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.658
Hey, I saw you this morning,

12:26.702 --> 12:29.400
coming out of Dr. Baum's office.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.271
Do you have news?

12:31.402 --> 12:33.056
No, no, it's just a check-up.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.710
Oh.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.801
Excuse me
for just a second.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.586
Okay, so,
suppose I was choking,

12:41.630 --> 12:43.937
could you Heimlich me?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.416
We don't really
call it that anymore,

12:45.460 --> 12:46.896
but yeah, sure.

12:46.940 --> 12:50.030
Do you ever just
turn the sirens on for fun?

12:50.073 --> 12:51.727
- We're not supposed to...
- I'll be right back.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.684
Okay.

12:58.603 --> 12:59.735
Sarah...

12:59.779 --> 13:01.258
Yeah?

13:01.302 --> 13:03.173
I'm sorry if I upset you.

13:03.217 --> 13:06.394
No, I'm fine, really.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.875
What is it?

13:11.660 --> 13:14.837
I did go see Dr. Baum today...

13:18.623 --> 13:23.237
and he said
that I have endometriosis,

13:23.280 --> 13:27.023
and I might not be able
to get pregnant.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.417
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.506
I haven't even
worked up the nerve

13:31.549 --> 13:32.942
to tell Kevin about it yet.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.555
My brother married you
for a good reason.

13:37.599 --> 13:38.774
He thinks you're perfect.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.734
I'm not perfect.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.127
But you're perfect for him.

13:45.737 --> 13:49.350
You guys are going to be
amazing parents.

13:49.393 --> 13:50.917
One way or another,

13:50.960 --> 13:53.223
you're going to find a way
to fill your arms with babies.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.271
I hope you're right.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.539
Thank you.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.326
That was fun.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.069
Evan's a piece of work, huh?

14:14.244 --> 14:15.463
I kinda like him.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.117
Yeah.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.597
Kevin and Sarah
are trying to have a baby.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.296
Oh, nice.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.689
I remember them saying
that they wanted a lot of kids.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.735
But Sarah told me

14:26.778 --> 14:27.910
she might have trouble
conceiving.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.871
That's tough.

14:31.914 --> 14:35.570
It's not the end of the world,
though, is it,

14:35.613 --> 14:36.919
to not be able to have a baby?

14:36.963 --> 14:39.922
No, I guess not.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.141
It's sad, though.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.763
Mm.
What smells so good?

14:54.806 --> 14:56.417
I'm making me casserole.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.549
Your special casserole?

14:58.593 --> 14:59.550
Uh-huh.

14:59.594 --> 15:00.943
For who?

15:00.987 --> 15:03.119
Do you really want
Arthur Driscoll

15:03.163 --> 15:05.687
to be sitting down
and talking with you?

15:05.730 --> 15:07.123
I do.

15:07.167 --> 15:11.084
Uh-huh, well then,
this casserole is for him.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.390
Hmm. Thank you.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.437
Hey, did you get my text?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.482
Yeah, I'm intrigued.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.832
So they found these
on the hotel building site?

15:20.876 --> 15:21.964
Mm-hmm, they were digging

15:22.008 --> 15:23.966
the underground
parking structure,

15:24.010 --> 15:25.359
and found these in the soil.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.664
Whoa...

15:26.708 --> 15:28.579
Wow, this is so cool.

15:30.712 --> 15:31.931
I guess we should call somebody.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.236
I already did.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.237
There's an archeologist
from the Smithsonian

15:34.281 --> 15:35.238
coming down.

15:35.282 --> 15:36.892
They look Colonial.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
Okay, look at this fork,

15:38.981 --> 15:40.940
and look at this fork.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.332
three, or what, 400 years
have passed,

15:42.376 --> 15:43.333
and the only real change

15:43.377 --> 15:45.509
is four tines instead of three?

15:45.553 --> 15:47.468
History is fascinating,
don't you think?

15:47.511 --> 15:49.905
It was not
my favorite subject.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.733
Listen, you realize

15:51.776 --> 15:53.387
that this could cauls
a work stoppage

15:53.430 --> 15:55.476
if they find something
significant.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.868
It's no big deal.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.740
It's part of the fun
of building stuff.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.698
Heck, on one of my construction
sites in Scotland,

16:00.742 --> 16:02.265
they found
a 1000-year-old skeleton.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.484
Really?

16:03.527 --> 16:04.659
Evan's now in a museum
in Edinburgh.

16:04.702 --> 16:05.921
You called it "Evan"?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.488
It wasn't my idea,

16:07.531 --> 16:08.968
but I paid for the excavation,

16:09.011 --> 16:11.013
and the museum
decided to name it after me,

16:11.057 --> 16:12.710
but you know what
the best thing

16:12.754 --> 16:14.060
about Evan the Skeleton is?

16:14.103 --> 16:15.235
I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.106
He has a nice face.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.328
Now, don't take it personally
if he's rude.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.025
He is a little cranky.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.853
Oh, ho, ho, I remember.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.078
Who's there?

16:32.121 --> 16:33.166
It's me again!

16:33.209 --> 16:34.602
Megan O'Brien!

16:36.343 --> 16:37.257
What is wrong with you?

16:37.300 --> 16:38.867
Can't you take a hint?

16:38.910 --> 16:43.002
Well, I brought someone
that you might remember.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.049
Nell O'Brien,

16:47.093 --> 16:49.356
as I live and breathe.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.445
Hello, Arthur Driscoll.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.361
I've brought you a casserole.

16:54.404 --> 16:55.927
This is delicious.

16:55.971 --> 16:58.191
Reminds me of the old days.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.499
Sure now, what brought you
back here, Arthur?

17:02.543 --> 17:06.764
I spent a thousand hours
sitting on the shore here,

17:06.808 --> 17:09.071
reading and sketching.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.769
Closest I came to happiness.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.075
I, um...

17:13.119 --> 17:14.729
I'm so sorry

17:14.772 --> 17:16.861
that I did not
stay in touch with you

17:16.905 --> 17:18.602
after Elaine died.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.561
Oh, I lost contact
with everyone.

17:20.604 --> 17:23.216
Elaine was my contact.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.695
How's Charlie?

17:26.175 --> 17:30.179
Charlie passed on
a long time ago.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.354
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.574
There are so few people around

17:33.617 --> 17:35.924
who remember the old days
anymore.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.969
Oh, and do you remember

17:38.013 --> 17:41.321
that precious
one-room school house

17:41.364 --> 17:44.106
on Norton Point Road?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.629
I think I did
a painting of that.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.327
What?

17:47.370 --> 17:48.850
Oh...

17:58.729 --> 17:59.904
Arthur...

18:03.778 --> 18:06.085
Here it is.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.043
Arthur...

18:08.087 --> 18:09.871
Oh. Oh...

18:09.914 --> 18:11.873
Well, you...
you captured it,

18:11.916 --> 18:12.961
perfectly.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.615
- Ah, it's okay.
- No...

18:14.658 --> 18:15.616
You can have it.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.357
- What?
- She can?

18:17.400 --> 18:18.532
Sure.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.403
I don't want it.

18:20.447 --> 18:23.145
I haven't painted
or drawn anything for years.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.714
The man who made them

18:26.757 --> 18:28.977
seems like an entirely
different person.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.154
Well, I will...

18:32.198 --> 18:34.069
I will treasure this.

18:34.113 --> 18:34.896
Thank you, Arthur.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.163
Come on, it's you and me, kid.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.686
Okay, let's do it.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.348
<i>Female, early 20s,</i>

18:52.392 --> 18:54.176
<i>She has collapsed
at Chesapeake Shores Library.</i>

18:54.220 --> 18:56.744
<i>Reportedly in and out
of consciousness.</i>

19:01.792 --> 19:03.098
You are okay.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.708
We're taking you
to the Emergency room right now.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.884
We're here to help.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.452
Now, Miss, are you allergic
to any medication?

19:09.496 --> 19:10.540
Miss...

19:10.584 --> 19:11.628
are you allergic
to any medication?

19:11.672 --> 19:13.195
I don't think so.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.241
Are you on any medication
right now?

19:15.284 --> 19:17.808
Antibiotics for an ear infection.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.767
It's in my book bag.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.167
Point three milliliters
epinephrine right now, Captain.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

19:38.394 --> 19:40.962
- What?
- I said .3 milliliters,

19:41.005 --> 19:43.269
not .6!

19:43.312 --> 19:44.618
What?

19:51.451 --> 19:52.887
Remember every year

19:52.930 --> 19:53.975
when we used to go

19:54.018 --> 19:55.150
to Aunt Casey's house
for Easter,

19:55.194 --> 19:56.456
and she would have
those pretty baskets

19:56.499 --> 19:58.109
with the chocolate bunnies,
and the eggs,

19:58.153 --> 19:59.110
and the jelly beans?

19:59.154 --> 20:00.242
Hello, Jess.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.156
I'm fine, how are you?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.766
My point is,

20:02.810 --> 20:05.639
aunts are important.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.903
You should never underestimate
the power of aunts.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.035
Yes.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.472
What is happening right now?

20:13.734 --> 20:15.388
How am I
supposed to be a mother?

20:17.085 --> 20:19.305
Well, um...

20:19.348 --> 20:20.175
you give birth.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.132
No, seriously.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.874
I have no idea how to be a mom.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.485
My mother wasn't around

20:25.528 --> 20:29.053
to teach me
basic mothering stuff.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.535
Well, you had Gran,

20:32.579 --> 20:33.362
and Abby,

20:33.406 --> 20:35.582
and... me-ish?

20:35.625 --> 20:39.238
But not my mom.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.282
How am I supposed to know

20:40.326 --> 20:42.458
how to teach them
right from wrong,

20:42.502 --> 20:44.504
or remember
to stand up straight,

20:44.547 --> 20:45.809
or send thank you notes?

20:45.853 --> 20:48.464
You just do that stuff,

20:48.508 --> 20:51.902
and you just
love your kids, Jess.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.730
You have so much love
to go around.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.123
You'll don't have to worry
about this.

20:57.386 --> 20:58.300
I don't know.

20:59.693 --> 21:00.737
You don't know what?

21:01.956 --> 21:04.524
If I want to have kids.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.830
Is that a terrible thing to say?

21:06.874 --> 21:09.442
No.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.444
No, no, if...

21:11.487 --> 21:13.489
If you don't want kids,
that's fine.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.535
But what if David wants to?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.713
Oh.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.323
You haven't talked about that?

21:21.367 --> 21:24.021
Not really.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.893
I guess we should, huh?

21:25.936 --> 21:27.764
Before we...

21:27.808 --> 21:31.333
I-I think you should.

21:40.734 --> 21:41.648
Kevin...

21:41.691 --> 21:44.259
He could have killed that girl.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.565
Yeah.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.220
What are you going to do?

21:49.264 --> 21:50.526
I have to report it.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.919
I can't cover for him.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.964
I know.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.226
Did you talk to him about it?

21:55.270 --> 21:57.098
I tried to.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.491
You owe it to him.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.380
Hey, Captain, you home?

22:18.424 --> 22:19.816
Captain!

22:19.860 --> 22:21.557
You here?

22:22.863 --> 22:24.430
It's Kev.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.239
Welcome to my world.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.633
Sorry, just the door was open.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.199
Do you know

22:55.243 --> 22:57.158
that out of everybody
at he station-house,

22:57.201 --> 23:00.857
you're the only one
that noticed?

23:00.901 --> 23:02.511
Or the only one
who said something.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.079
I wasn't trying to pry.

23:05.122 --> 23:08.343
It started
about four months ago.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.737
Little things.

23:10.780 --> 23:13.261
Forgetting people's names,

23:13.304 --> 23:15.045
where I left my car.

23:16.699 --> 23:20.311
Then I'd get better.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.704
I thought it was
a passing thing, you know?

23:22.966 --> 23:25.055
Then it would come back...

23:25.099 --> 23:27.231
worse.

23:27.275 --> 23:30.017
The forgetfulness,

23:30.060 --> 23:32.193
the confusion.

23:32.236 --> 23:33.542
What can I do to help?

23:33.586 --> 23:35.457
I appreciate that,

23:35.501 --> 23:37.633
but I'm seeing my doctor
tomorrow.

23:37.677 --> 23:40.506
I was a stubborn fool,
putting it off,

23:40.549 --> 23:43.857
not wanting to know the truth.

23:43.900 --> 23:44.727
I see.

23:44.771 --> 23:45.815
I mean,

23:45.859 --> 23:46.947
I thought I could stay
on the job

23:46.990 --> 23:48.427
until I couldn't hide it
anymore.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.909
Then I almost killed that woman.

23:55.999 --> 23:56.826
If you hadn't been there...

23:59.916 --> 24:01.396
You know, Captain,

24:01.440 --> 24:02.963
if this was any other
kind of job, maybe you could--

24:03.006 --> 24:05.705
But it's isn't, is it?

24:05.748 --> 24:07.489
It's life and death, every day.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.536
I tell you,
I've been at this job

24:10.579 --> 24:12.929
for over 30 years.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.977
It's really hard to let it go.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.458
I'm so sorry.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.548
I'm going to step down.

24:23.810 --> 24:24.811
I, uh--

24:24.854 --> 24:26.073
I'll do it soon...

24:27.553 --> 24:29.946
and I won't go
on any more rides,

24:29.990 --> 24:32.993
so you don't have to worry.

24:33.036 --> 24:35.691
I kind of
can't help but worry.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.760
Hey.

25:00.803 --> 25:01.848
Hey, just left
a little something in my desk.

25:01.891 --> 25:02.979
Did you lock it?

25:03.023 --> 25:04.807
Sure did.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.515
Thanks for driving.

25:16.558 --> 25:17.820
Mandrake hates to take days off,

25:17.864 --> 25:19.256
but I insist.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.997
This is your bungalow?

25:21.041 --> 25:22.782
Yeah.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.653
Hey, you want to come in,
have some dinner?

25:24.697 --> 25:25.959
I'm sure there's a kitchen
and food in there somewhere.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.700
Next to
your indoor swimming pool?

25:27.743 --> 25:29.484
No, no, that is around back.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.399
I have to get home,

25:31.442 --> 25:33.270
but you give me a call
if you get lost in there.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.707
Will do!

26:12.919 --> 26:15.399
Hey, what did you
want to talk about?

26:20.100 --> 26:21.275
Well, I went to see Dr. Baum...

26:24.713 --> 26:27.063
and he said I might have trouble
getting pregnant.

26:27.107 --> 26:29.022
Oh.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.113
Endometriosis.

26:33.156 --> 26:35.028
Hey, hey, honey...

26:35.071 --> 26:36.203
we'll be okay.

26:36.246 --> 26:37.639
No, but, Kevin,
we want a family--

26:37.683 --> 26:38.858
And we'll have one.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.903
If it comes down to it,
we could adopt.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.821
As long as we have each other,
nothing else matters.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.223
I'm going to go
for a swim.

26:56.266 --> 26:57.659
Big race in two days.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.313
But it's the middle
of the dinner rush.

26:59.356 --> 27:00.793
I could use some help.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.492
It's winding down.

27:04.535 --> 27:05.711
I'm sure you can handle it.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.147
Yeah, I know, I'm sure I can,

27:07.190 --> 27:08.539
but I'd appreciate it
if you would--

27:08.583 --> 27:09.976
Why are you yelling at me?

27:10.019 --> 27:11.934
I'm not yelling at you.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.894
I've never yelled at you
in my entire life.

27:14.937 --> 27:15.982
What's wrong?

27:17.897 --> 27:19.594
Why are you marrying me?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.727
Um...

27:21.770 --> 27:24.643
Because you're awesome

27:24.686 --> 27:26.253
and I love you.

27:26.296 --> 27:28.559
Don't you think
it's irresponsible

27:28.603 --> 27:32.041
to jump into a marriage
for reasons like that?

27:33.173 --> 27:34.914
Okay...

27:34.957 --> 27:37.830
what's going on?

27:37.873 --> 27:40.702
Talk to me.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.225
I think you should know

27:42.269 --> 27:44.053
that I...

27:44.097 --> 27:46.577
might not be
a very good mother.

27:48.754 --> 27:52.279
Okay, well, I think that
you might be wrong about that.

27:52.322 --> 27:55.804
I just want you to be fully...

27:55.848 --> 27:57.414
I want you to be aware...

27:57.458 --> 28:01.201
I'm saying that
I wouldn't blame you...

28:02.593 --> 28:04.030
Do you understand?

28:04.073 --> 28:06.641
No, not really.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.903
What are you saying?

28:07.947 --> 28:09.209
That you're not going to be
a good mother

28:09.252 --> 28:10.950
to the children
that we don't even have yet?

28:10.993 --> 28:12.908
Exactly.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.521
What if I don't know
what I'm doing,

28:17.565 --> 28:19.915
as a parent?

28:19.959 --> 28:23.092
But that's the whole point.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.746
Nobody knows what they're doing.

28:24.790 --> 28:27.183
You figure it out,

28:27.227 --> 28:30.186
and whatever happens,
we do together.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.711
It's not like anything

28:32.754 --> 28:34.756
is all on you.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.368
But what if don't...

28:38.412 --> 28:41.763
What if I don't want kids?

28:47.029 --> 28:49.510
Um...

28:49.553 --> 28:51.251
You don't?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.689
I don't know.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.648
But what if I don't?

28:57.692 --> 28:59.650
Would you still
want to marry me?

29:08.834 --> 29:11.445
You didn't answer.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.752
No, I didn't.

29:28.984 --> 29:29.811
When is Dad
going to call that lawyer?

29:29.855 --> 29:31.073
I don't know,

29:31.117 --> 29:32.292
but he's saying
he wants to do it himself,

29:32.335 --> 29:33.119
which scares me.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.642
Hey, David.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.687
Would you make that delicious
eggs benny with crab meat

29:36.731 --> 29:38.254
for brunch
instead of breakfast?

29:38.298 --> 29:39.821
I can make it happen.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.083
You're a good man.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.476
I'll be out on the porch

29:42.519 --> 29:43.869
if anyone wants to join me
in a game of backgammon.

29:49.613 --> 29:52.399
Ah, you're ready to take on
the Backgammon Master, huh?

29:52.442 --> 29:55.489
One question before we start--

29:55.532 --> 29:56.925
how do you play this game?

29:56.969 --> 29:58.535
Why are you here?

29:58.579 --> 29:59.972
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

30:00.015 --> 30:01.800
you bought a giant bungalow

30:01.843 --> 30:03.192
that has
an indoor swimming pool,

30:03.236 --> 30:04.977
and probably a tennis court
and a bowling alley.

30:05.020 --> 30:05.934
But only duck pin.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.111
Again, why are you here?

30:09.155 --> 30:10.460
I like it here.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.941
I like the people,
I like the activity.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.334
There's always something going
around here.

30:14.377 --> 30:15.465
My place is so...

30:15.509 --> 30:16.466
quiet.

30:16.510 --> 30:17.859
Lonely?

30:17.903 --> 30:20.557
I had dinner
with Jess and David,

30:20.601 --> 30:21.863
and Kevin and Sarah.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.996
No, I...
I crashed their dinner,

30:24.039 --> 30:25.432
I guess, yeah.

30:25.475 --> 30:26.999
But I had a great time,
you know?

30:27.042 --> 30:28.000
They were so much fun,

30:28.043 --> 30:29.871
and they knew each other
so well.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.264
It was like...

30:31.307 --> 30:32.265
Family?

30:32.308 --> 30:34.223
Yeah.

30:34.267 --> 30:35.834
I never really had that.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.401
Oh. I'm sorry.

30:38.445 --> 30:39.838
Don't be.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.317
It made me who I am today.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.494
All right.

30:44.538 --> 30:45.713
Backgammon...

30:45.756 --> 30:47.106
Take the little dice,

30:47.149 --> 30:48.934
and put it in the little cup.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.500
I am all ears.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.633
Well, we're ready to begin.

30:52.676 --> 30:54.504
Is your lawyer going to be
gracing us with his presence?

30:54.548 --> 30:55.941
I'll be representing myself.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.290
How nice.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.900
Hello, everyone.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.815
Connor...

31:00.859 --> 31:02.338
there's no reason
for you to be here.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.644
Oh, don't mind me,
I'm just observing.

31:04.819 --> 31:05.907
Connor...

31:05.951 --> 31:08.910
If Mr. O'Brien
wants to observe,

31:08.954 --> 31:10.129
let him observe.

31:10.172 --> 31:11.957
Mr. O'Brien,
we want you to understand

31:12.000 --> 31:14.263
that Paul Dilpher respects you,

31:14.307 --> 31:15.961
and he wants to come
to an agreement

31:16.004 --> 31:17.788
that can end quickly.

31:17.832 --> 31:20.966
There's no point going down
a hard and difficult road here.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.489
And what does this agreement
look like?

31:22.532 --> 31:23.707
Because right now,
it looks to me

31:23.751 --> 31:26.014
like I'm being set up
to be the fall guy

31:26.058 --> 31:26.928
for Paul Dilpher.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.234
It's not personal, Mick.

31:28.277 --> 31:29.235
It's just business.

31:29.278 --> 31:30.627
Oh, it's very personal.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.412
You're trying to destroy me

31:32.455 --> 31:33.717
and my reputation.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.371
Mr. O'Brien,
just hear us out.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.677
No, you hear me out.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.419
I have proof

31:39.462 --> 31:42.639
that several of the contracts
Mr. Dilpher claims I signed

31:42.683 --> 31:44.728
are, in fact, forgeries.

31:44.772 --> 31:47.557
Consequently,
I'm going to make you an offer.

31:47.601 --> 31:48.907
Wonderful.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.560
Let's get to it.

31:50.604 --> 31:53.172
It's a one-time-only offer,
and it expires in five minutes.

31:53.215 --> 31:54.216
We're all ears.

31:54.260 --> 31:57.045
I will walk away
from all of this

31:57.089 --> 31:59.874
if Mr. Dilpher will sign
a document right now

31:59.918 --> 32:02.485
stating that he lied
about my involvement,

32:02.529 --> 32:03.965
and if he apologizes

32:04.009 --> 32:05.401
profusely

32:05.445 --> 32:06.794
and publicly

32:06.837 --> 32:10.015
for implicating me
in his illegal transactions.

32:10.058 --> 32:11.842
We thought you were coming
to your senses.

32:11.886 --> 32:15.498
This is Leonard Shakley
and Associates,

32:15.542 --> 32:16.978
builders in California.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.241
This is Gross and Madden,

32:19.285 --> 32:21.069
builders in Wisconsin.

32:21.113 --> 32:22.723
Smith and Sons,

32:22.766 --> 32:24.768
Oregon.

32:24.812 --> 32:26.205
It seems they, too,

32:26.248 --> 32:28.772
found discrepancies
in Mr. Dilpher's contracts.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.252
That's very interesting,

32:30.296 --> 32:31.906
but...

32:31.950 --> 32:34.865
I have some documents here, too.

32:34.909 --> 32:37.129
A personal communication
between your children,

32:37.172 --> 32:40.784
Mr. Connor O'Brien
and Mrs. Abby O'Brien-Winters.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.395
In it,

32:42.438 --> 32:44.484
they claim that they believe
their father is not innocent.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.529
You have no right

32:46.573 --> 32:47.966
to go through
my personal correspondence

32:48.009 --> 32:49.141
and steal documents.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.838
I knew you would
speak up eventually.

32:50.881 --> 32:52.448
Anything written
on company time

32:52.492 --> 32:54.189
is a work product.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.582
This was found
in the garbage here.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.063
Linda, that was locked
in my desk.

32:58.106 --> 33:02.371
We'll have to agree
to disagree on that one.

33:02.415 --> 33:06.723
"Abby, I'm so worried
about Dad.

33:06.767 --> 33:10.814
Who knows what he knew
or when he knew it?

33:10.858 --> 33:12.033
I feel like he should just
take responsibility

33:12.077 --> 33:13.426
for anything he was a part of.

33:13.469 --> 33:14.993
After all,

33:15.036 --> 33:19.127
he was the one who raised us
to tell the truth."

33:19.171 --> 33:20.650
Wait...

33:20.694 --> 33:23.610
what's on the second page
of that letter?

33:26.308 --> 33:27.962
The second page?

33:28.006 --> 33:28.963
That's right.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.225
Because, as I said,

33:30.269 --> 33:32.619
that was locked in my desk,

33:32.662 --> 33:35.056
and it was a first draft
on the firm's stationary...

33:35.100 --> 33:38.059
that I notarized
and mailed to myself

33:38.103 --> 33:39.017
here at the firm.

33:47.808 --> 33:51.203
"I feel it is his duty
to tell the truth...

33:51.246 --> 33:53.118
about who ate
Gran's coffee cake.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.730
We all deserved to enjoy it,

33:56.773 --> 33:59.950
and he selfishly
ate more than his share,

33:59.994 --> 34:01.778
leaving just crumbs.

34:01.822 --> 34:02.736
Connor."

34:05.086 --> 34:06.305
I'm sorry, Connor,

34:06.348 --> 34:07.523
I just...

34:07.567 --> 34:09.960
I just can't resist
Mom's coffee cake.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.229
I find it shocking

34:17.272 --> 34:19.013
that people who are
supposed to be my colleagues

34:19.057 --> 34:20.232
would go through
my personal correspondence.

34:22.886 --> 34:24.497
I have no choice

34:24.540 --> 34:26.629
but to offer my resignation
immediately,

34:26.673 --> 34:28.892
which I happen to have on me.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.764
I quit.

34:30.807 --> 34:32.505
These documents prove

34:32.548 --> 34:34.289
that Dilpher forged
Mr. O'Brien's signature

34:34.333 --> 34:36.639
on 24 separate contracts,

34:36.683 --> 34:37.988
and this letter proves

34:38.032 --> 34:40.339
that this law firm
spied on a junior associate

34:40.382 --> 34:44.647
in an attempt to get intel
on his family.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.868
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.393
I'll be reporting this
to the Bar Association.

34:51.437 --> 34:52.612
Thank you.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.179
Thank you very much.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.143
That's my son,

35:02.187 --> 35:03.579
the lawyer.

35:07.322 --> 35:09.498
Well, we did it.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.891
Yes, we did.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.936
I'm very proud of you, Connor.

35:12.980 --> 35:15.417
That was a brave thing you did,
quitting your job like that.

35:15.461 --> 35:16.549
I don't know.

35:16.592 --> 35:17.941
I couldn't have
kept working here.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.682
What are you going to do now?

35:19.726 --> 35:21.510
I hadn't really
thought about it.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.643
Except I'm done
working for big law firms.

35:23.686 --> 35:27.168
I want to practice law,
that's why I became a lawyer.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.126
Then why don't you?

35:28.169 --> 35:29.344
What am I going to do,

35:29.388 --> 35:30.911
hang up my shingle
in Chesapeake Shores?

35:30.954 --> 35:32.391
Connor O'Brien,
attorney-at-law?

35:32.434 --> 35:33.914
Sure. Why not?

35:46.100 --> 35:47.971
We just wanted
a second opinion.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.973
Which is very wise,

35:50.017 --> 35:51.714
and I have to tell you,
the news is not that bad.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.803
But I do have endometriosis,

35:53.847 --> 35:55.109
and I read something like

35:55.153 --> 35:57.285
40% percent of women
with endometriosis

35:57.329 --> 35:58.678
have problems conceiving?

35:58.721 --> 36:00.680
For every bit
of real information

36:00.723 --> 36:02.247
you can find on the Internet,

36:02.290 --> 36:04.858
you can also get led down
a rabbit hole of misinformation

36:04.901 --> 36:05.946
and doom and gloom.

36:05.989 --> 36:07.339
That's what I warned you about.

36:07.382 --> 36:08.427
You did it, too.

36:08.470 --> 36:09.471
I know, but--

36:09.515 --> 36:10.777
Everybody does it.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.040
Just don't believe the worst.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.868
Now, how long
have you been trying?

36:14.911 --> 36:16.826
A couple months.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.567
I say you give it
at least six months

36:18.611 --> 36:20.743
before we consider
other options.

36:20.787 --> 36:21.918
That shouldn't be too hard,
should it?

36:21.962 --> 36:23.006
No.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.747
What other options?

36:24.791 --> 36:27.576
Well, we could consider IUI,

36:27.620 --> 36:29.883
intrauterine insemination,

36:29.926 --> 36:31.711
or we may have to use surgery

36:31.754 --> 36:33.539
to remove
the endometrial growths,

36:33.582 --> 36:35.193
but let's just focus
on the now.

36:37.369 --> 36:38.979
And remember,

36:39.022 --> 36:40.502
many women
who have your condition

36:40.546 --> 36:42.461
are able to have
healthy, full-term babies.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.550
Don't worry.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.467
The bottom line is,
we're going to get through it,

36:48.510 --> 36:50.382
and I'm going to be with you
every step of the way.

36:50.425 --> 36:51.513
I know, but...

36:51.557 --> 36:54.168
But what?

36:54.212 --> 36:55.822
This isn't me,
I'm not a worrier.

36:55.865 --> 36:56.997
So?

36:57.040 --> 37:00.218
So why am I
so worried about this?

37:00.261 --> 37:02.176
I mean,
I run into burning buildings

37:02.220 --> 37:03.351
without giving it
a second thought,

37:03.395 --> 37:04.744
but this?

37:04.787 --> 37:06.746
This just stresses me out.

37:06.789 --> 37:09.488
Because you can't control it.

37:09.531 --> 37:12.447
I promise you, Sarah,
we're going to get through this.

37:27.201 --> 37:27.984
Hey.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.248
Hey.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.468
I'm sorry

37:33.512 --> 37:35.035
about what I said yesterday.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.691
Did you mean it?

37:39.648 --> 37:41.215
I don't know.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.956
I'm not sure.

37:42.999 --> 37:46.612
Look, I'm not sure either,

37:46.655 --> 37:49.005
but I know
I want to be with you...

37:50.920 --> 37:52.792
and...

37:52.835 --> 37:54.533
I'd like to have kids.

37:56.361 --> 37:59.581
But if you don't want to,
then...

37:59.625 --> 38:01.757
I guess I'm just
going to have to deal with that.

38:05.108 --> 38:07.110
I love you,

38:07.154 --> 38:09.896
and I'm not saying
I definitely don't want kids.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.201
I'm just saying

38:11.245 --> 38:14.161
the idea scares the heck
out of me.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.554
Yeah, well, it is...

38:15.597 --> 38:16.729
it's pretty scary.

38:17.947 --> 38:19.122
Yeah.

38:26.391 --> 38:27.914
Hey.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.481
I'll see you
at the finish line, Mom.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.396
May the best woman win,
darling.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.311
All right, guys.

38:33.354 --> 38:34.486
Keep the pace,
we can win this thing.

38:34.529 --> 38:37.140
And remember,
it's not about winning.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.229
It's about taking part.

38:40.361 --> 38:41.319
Good one.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.581
You're funny.

38:42.624 --> 38:43.930
We're O'Briens,
it's all about winning.

38:43.973 --> 38:46.106
- See ya out there.

38:46.149 --> 38:47.847
- Okay.
- We've gotta beat them.

38:47.890 --> 38:48.891

And now,

40:03.923 --> 40:05.054
I'd like to present

40:05.098 --> 40:07.883
our beloved Fire Captain,
Roger Gahagan.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.232
Come on up here, Roger!

40:10.495 --> 40:11.409
Thank you.

40:12.801 --> 40:15.021
Well, thank you very much.

40:15.064 --> 40:18.894
We raised enough money
for a brand-new fire truck.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.420
Yes. Isn't that fantastic?

40:23.551 --> 40:26.075
And since we have
a new fire truck...

40:26.119 --> 40:27.947
I think it's time
we had a new Captain.

40:31.603 --> 40:32.865
That's right,

40:32.908 --> 40:34.693
I'm stepping down.

40:34.736 --> 40:36.216
Retiring.

40:36.259 --> 40:39.437
I think, uh...

40:41.787 --> 40:44.616
I think it's time
to take it easy for a while.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.184
Thank you to everyone.

40:48.228 --> 40:49.098
It's been a great ride.

40:50.230 --> 40:51.274
Thank you, everybody.

40:51.318 --> 40:54.234
Thank you.

40:56.018 --> 40:57.063
I love you.

40:59.413 --> 41:01.284
So I said,
you tell me.

41:03.199 --> 41:04.244
All right, everybody,

41:04.287 --> 41:05.506
I'd like to make a toast

41:05.550 --> 41:08.553
to all of these fine athletes
here today.

41:08.596 --> 41:09.815
- Cheers!
- Well done.

41:09.858 --> 41:10.816
Especially to Mom.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.644
You really brought it.

41:12.687 --> 41:13.993
Thank you, son,

41:14.036 --> 41:15.560
and I also brought
Epsom Salts.

41:15.603 --> 41:16.952
I am soaking
in a hot tub tonight.

41:16.996 --> 41:17.823
Everything hurts.

41:19.215 --> 41:20.434
I'd also like to make
another toast

41:20.478 --> 41:21.957
- to Connor and Abby.
- Yes.

41:22.001 --> 41:25.265
The Dilpher case against me
has been dropped,

41:25.308 --> 41:26.875
and criminal charges
are being been brought

41:26.919 --> 41:28.616
against Paul Dilpher
as we speak.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.183
Hear, hear!

41:30.226 --> 41:31.358
- All right.
- Cheers.

41:31.401 --> 41:32.664
Well, we knew
it would work out, Dad.

41:32.707 --> 41:33.839
Not without you guys.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.146
I've also made
a very important decision

41:37.190 --> 41:38.147
regarding the wedding.

41:38.191 --> 41:39.540
Oh, you don't want any gifts?

41:40.759 --> 41:42.412
No, I want gifts.
Lots of gifts.

41:42.456 --> 41:43.892
- That's not it.
- Got it.

41:45.241 --> 41:48.027
I would like Abby
to be my Maid of Honor

41:48.070 --> 41:50.986
and Bree, to officiate.

41:51.030 --> 41:52.379
I'd be honored.

41:52.422 --> 41:53.380
Didn't you marry
Brian and Scott

41:53.423 --> 41:54.207
back in Chicago?

41:54.250 --> 41:55.425
I did, yeah,

41:55.469 --> 41:57.427
but I'm not registered
here in Maryland.

41:57.471 --> 41:58.820
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait.

42:00.213 --> 42:02.563
I can help with that.

42:02.607 --> 42:03.521
Click there.

42:03.564 --> 42:05.174
Okay.

42:05.218 --> 42:07.046
And now you are,

42:07.089 --> 42:08.308
and you owe me $50.

42:08.351 --> 42:09.570
Put it on my tab.

42:09.614 --> 42:11.572
I'm never gonna see that.

42:11.616 --> 42:13.269
This is going to be great!

42:13.313 --> 42:14.836
Wait,
if I'm your Maid of Honor,

42:14.880 --> 42:16.055
does that mean

42:16.098 --> 42:16.795
I get to throw you
a Bachelorette Party?

42:16.838 --> 42:17.839
Uh-oh.

42:17.883 --> 42:18.797
Should I be worried?

42:18.840 --> 42:19.928
Very worried.
