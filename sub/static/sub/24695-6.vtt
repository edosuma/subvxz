00:12.242 --> 00:13.787
Morgan.

00:13.855 --> 00:15.396
Pretentious.

00:15.464 --> 00:16.467
"sophie."

00:16.544 --> 00:17.722
Hmm, too italian.

00:19.810 --> 00:21.083
"mavis."

00:21.151 --> 00:22.995
Too jewish.

00:23.063 --> 00:26.010
Okay, then I have "morgan."

00:26.078 --> 00:27.415
Can I have "morgan," please?

00:27.482 --> 00:28.689
- What's in it for me?
- Please, please, please?

00:28.757 --> 00:30.261
- What is in it for me?
- Oh!

00:30.328 --> 00:33.203
Linda.

00:33.271 --> 00:35.843
Come and get me.

00:37.414 --> 00:40.421
I'm waiting. - Hmm.

Linda, you want the
rest of the bellinis?

00:55.123 --> 00:59.230
do you want the rest of...

01:01.704 --> 01:04.040
Are you gonna--

01:04.108 --> 01:06.111
Linda?

01:08.549 --> 01:11.550
Linda!

01:50.388 --> 01:52.323
S-s-s...

01:52.390 --> 01:54.058
Something awful happened.

01:55.659 --> 01:57.689
I think I shot my wife.

01:57.757 --> 02:01.385
All right, take it easy.
Take it easy, okay?

02:01.452 --> 02:02.918
We're gonna get
someone to help you.

02:09.425 --> 02:11.525
- No, no!
- Hey, wait a minute!

02:11.593 --> 02:13.393
Hey! Hey, wait! - No! Aah!

02:13.461 --> 02:16.363
Whoa.

02:20.064 --> 02:22.664
<i>Addic7ed.com Adriano_CSI</i>

03:02.967 --> 03:04.468
C.O.D. Is a single gunshot
wound to the heart.

03:04.536 --> 03:06.841
Nothing in her pockets.
Maybe robbed?

03:06.909 --> 03:09.212
Uh, there's an
indentation on her finger;

03:09.280 --> 03:10.747
A wedding or engagement ring.

03:10.815 --> 03:11.982
Well, I don't know about robbed.

03:12.049 --> 03:13.583
They wouldn't have
left this necklace.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.050
There's no bullet
hole in the shirt.

03:15.118 --> 03:17.585
She was dressed post-mortem,
but the fly's unzipped.

03:17.653 --> 03:18.852
You know, 'cause it's nice.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.121
It's a verdura or a bulgari.

03:21.188 --> 03:22.388
- Big ticket item.
- Yeah.

03:22.456 --> 03:25.658
The stains on her
hands look like varnish.

03:25.725 --> 03:27.325
Yes.

03:27.393 --> 03:29.227
Well, maybe she was doing
some kind of crafts.

03:29.294 --> 03:33.065
You know, pottery or
collage or paper mache,

03:33.132 --> 03:34.499
Or something like that,
so she took off the ring.

03:34.567 --> 03:37.435
Detectives,
there's a 7-series beemer

03:37.503 --> 03:39.638
Sitting in the middle of
the marina parking lot.

03:39.706 --> 03:42.206
You might want to have a look-see.

03:50.113 --> 03:53.215
Varnish again.

03:56.185 --> 03:57.284
What's it smell like?

03:57.352 --> 04:00.854
250 bucks a pound.

04:05.725 --> 04:06.825
It's bellinis.

04:06.893 --> 04:08.994
Made with imported white peaches

04:09.061 --> 04:10.295
Instead of liqueur.

04:10.362 --> 04:12.297
And latex.

04:12.364 --> 04:14.065
Oh, no, no. That's-
-that's me, I think.

04:14.133 --> 04:17.368
Yep. Ted and linda,
that's their car.

04:17.435 --> 04:18.565
You know the owners of this car?

04:18.634 --> 04:21.156
Yeah. The stoddards.

04:21.224 --> 04:22.583
I run the marina.

04:22.650 --> 04:25.290
They got a 42-foot
rhodes yawl. A classic.

04:25.358 --> 04:30.899
They come out every
Thursday and work on it.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.023
Ted sells medical equipment.

04:33.090 --> 04:35.684
Got me a blood pressure
thing half-price.

04:35.752 --> 04:36.683
Oh, yeah?

04:36.750 --> 04:38.515
This explains the varnish stains.

04:38.583 --> 04:42.377
Oh. High tax bracket,
but they're do-it-yourselfers.

04:42.444 --> 04:44.673
People like puttering
around their boats.

04:44.740 --> 04:47.038
Ted and linda were
into keeping this yar.

04:47.105 --> 04:48.802
"yar"?

04:48.870 --> 04:51.199
- Looking good.
- "yar"?

04:51.267 --> 04:53.463
<i>Doesn't katharine hepburn say
that in philadelphia story?</i>

04:53.531 --> 04:55.825
She says it to-- - jimmy stewart.

04:55.893 --> 04:57.525
To jimmy stewart. That's right.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.587
Yah--yar.

04:59.655 --> 05:01.420
- Detectives?
- Yes.

05:01.487 --> 05:04.149
Car's registered to
a theodore stoddard.

05:04.217 --> 05:06.812
No priors, wants, or warrants.

05:06.879 --> 05:09.975
Current address is
listed as 429 lafayette.

05:37.476 --> 05:40.437
This was thrown at the mirror.

05:40.502 --> 05:42.899
A hospital gown.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.363
The mud and dirt match the spot,

05:45.431 --> 05:48.059
So I'm guessing it was mr.
Stoddard.

05:48.127 --> 05:51.255
What, he didn't like wearing it?

05:52.787 --> 05:54.483
Watch winders.

05:54.550 --> 05:57.512
People are actually that lazy?

05:57.580 --> 06:00.044
Well, some really fine watches
have to be constantly wound.

06:00.111 --> 06:03.504
The question is,
where are these--these three?

06:03.572 --> 06:06.303
Hello. What's this?

06:06.370 --> 06:09.132
- Hmm.
- Hmm. Money bands.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.494
Hmm.

06:11.562 --> 06:15.291
Hey. Hey, good eye, detective.

06:15.359 --> 06:17.420
Look at that. - Oh.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.252
Hmm.

06:22.682 --> 06:27.574
Her passport, but his is missing.

06:27.642 --> 06:29.604
Really?

06:29.672 --> 06:33.067
So money, passport,
and valuable watches

06:33.135 --> 06:35.065
That could probably be sold.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.829
He's skipping the country.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.355
This guy is on the run.

06:40.423 --> 06:43.785
Stomach contents were
herring, duck pate,

06:43.852 --> 06:45.582
And peach-flavored champagne.

06:45.649 --> 06:46.880
Bellinis.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.811
We found a thermos.

06:48.879 --> 06:51.243
Drinks bellinis, but no manicure?

06:51.311 --> 06:53.575
There's sawdust under her nails.

06:53.643 --> 06:55.075
There are vague restraint marks

06:55.142 --> 06:57.337
On her ribs, calves, and wrists.

06:57.405 --> 06:59.334
Also these.

06:59.402 --> 07:00.400
Look like suction cup marks.

07:00.468 --> 07:02.664
Yeah. With traces of mastisol.

07:02.732 --> 07:05.727
It's an adhesive used to
keep contact disks in place.

07:05.794 --> 07:08.755
The killer took her vital signs?

07:08.823 --> 07:11.584
Maybe since stoddard
sold medical equipment.

07:11.652 --> 07:13.415
Okay, so, uh,

07:13.483 --> 07:15.313
They spend the afternoon
sipping bellinis

07:15.381 --> 07:17.345
While they varnish and sand.

07:17.413 --> 07:19.012
And a little afternoon delight?

07:19.079 --> 07:22.373
Dr. Feelgood dons a hospital gown

07:22.440 --> 07:25.536
And hooks her to a heart monitor,

07:25.603 --> 07:27.933
And the sounds of her vital signs

07:28.001 --> 07:30.362
Awaken cabin boy,

07:30.430 --> 07:31.561
But something goes wrong.

07:31.629 --> 07:33.659
He shoots her and runs home,

07:33.727 --> 07:36.688
Grabs his passport and his
fancy watch collection,

07:36.756 --> 07:39.284
And, uh, charters a
flight to zurich.

07:39.352 --> 07:40.650
The flight to zurich's

07:40.718 --> 07:41.916
The only part of that
that makes sense.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.980
Examine stoddard's finances

07:44.048 --> 07:46.342
And put a warrant out on him.

07:48.507 --> 07:49.705
Hey, serena, look at this.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.236
Ten minutes after opening bell,

07:51.304 --> 07:55.564
Stoddard's broker liquidated
all his mutual fund holdings.

07:55.632 --> 07:56.696
I wonder where they went.

07:56.764 --> 07:58.394
Here's something of interest.

07:58.462 --> 08:01.958
I entered single gunshot
wounds with restraint marks

08:02.025 --> 08:03.090
And the presence of mastisol

08:03.158 --> 08:04.654
From suction cups on the victim.

08:04.722 --> 08:06.317
You're not gonna tell
me it's commonplace.

08:06.385 --> 08:07.984
Three killings over
a four-year span.

08:08.051 --> 08:11.345
The oldest was in st.
Louis, 4/16/06.

08:11.412 --> 08:12.444
52-year-old female.

08:12.511 --> 08:14.941
C.O.D., gunshot wound to the head.

08:15.009 --> 08:16.705
Well, the mastisol

08:16.773 --> 08:18.909
Could have been from
the emts at the scene.

08:18.977 --> 08:23.239
Which brings us to a case
in the bronx, on 3/18/08.

08:23.307 --> 08:26.503
Dead for over six hours
before the body was found.

08:26.571 --> 08:30.268
The emts didn't put
the mastisol there.

08:30.335 --> 08:33.206
Wait a minute.
This case is closed.

08:33.274 --> 08:36.543
This man was shot by his wife,
veronica kalen.

08:36.611 --> 08:40.080
She's been serving 12 to
15 in bayview ever since.

08:45.519 --> 08:47.653
-Will talking to yous
iget me out of here?

08:47.721 --> 08:50.623
Not easy. Your own admission
of guilt got you in.

08:50.691 --> 08:53.726
Only to avoid a life sentence.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.761
I did not murder my husband.
I loved the guy.

08:56.829 --> 08:59.730
- Yeah. Well, that's-
- that's a good place to start.

08:59.798 --> 09:03.766
Um, ronnie, tell us what really,
really happened.

09:07.003 --> 09:10.471
My husband and I salsa
danced every Tuesday night.

09:10.539 --> 09:12.072
We were the first
couple on the floor,

09:12.140 --> 09:13.874
The last to leave.

09:13.942 --> 09:15.208
Lee had a circulation problem,

09:15.276 --> 09:17.844
So I would go down to the
car to warm it up for him.

09:17.911 --> 09:19.512
That's where I got grabbed.

09:19.580 --> 09:20.946
You got grabbed?

09:21.014 --> 09:22.347
Uh, before yr husband came out?

09:22.415 --> 09:23.648
Yeah, om behind.

09:23.716 --> 09:25.950
He put something over my
nose that knocked me out.

09:26.018 --> 09:28.019
You couldn't see
where he took you?

09:28.086 --> 09:30.387
I was out.

09:30.455 --> 09:32.756
I woke up.

09:32.824 --> 09:35.558
Lee and me were strapped to
these big, wooden chairs,

09:35.626 --> 09:36.693
Facing each other.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.394
There was wires coming off of us.

09:38.462 --> 09:42.364
And then he gives
leeland this ultimatum:

09:42.431 --> 09:47.535
Shoot me and he gets to live.

09:47.603 --> 09:51.605
Refuse...

09:51.673 --> 09:53.774
And lee refused.

09:53.842 --> 09:58.044
He had some real stones,
my husband.

09:58.112 --> 09:59.879
Son of a bitch blew his brains out,

09:59.946 --> 10:01.046
And I'm suffering for it.

10:01.114 --> 10:03.115
Ronnie, while he was
waiting for your husband

10:03.183 --> 10:05.050
To make this choice,

10:05.118 --> 10:07.886
Um, did the killer do anything,

10:07.954 --> 10:11.490
Uh, strange or--or kinky?

10:11.557 --> 10:12.724
You know...

10:12.792 --> 10:14.059
You mean, like, sexually?

10:14.127 --> 10:17.462
Yeah, did he take his clothes
off or fondle you or--?

10:17.529 --> 10:19.229
- No.
- Masturbate or--?

10:19.297 --> 10:21.997
No. No.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.133
The only weird thing
was that hospital band.

10:26.201 --> 10:29.102
Hospital band?

10:29.169 --> 10:32.271
After he shot leeland,
he dosed me again.

10:32.338 --> 10:33.438
And when I woke up,

10:33.506 --> 10:35.306
He had put this hospital
band on my wrist.

10:35.374 --> 10:37.609
What happened to
the hospital band?

10:37.676 --> 10:41.145
Cops took it.

10:41.213 --> 10:43.381
Evidence.

10:50.487 --> 10:53.956
You actually believe this
whole playing doctor scenario?

10:53.824 --> 10:54.957
- Some of it.
- Not all of it.

10:55.025 --> 10:56.526
No, no, try not
canceling each other out.

10:56.593 --> 10:57.860
You first.

10:57.928 --> 11:00.229
Well, we know that stoddard
sold medical equipment,

11:00.297 --> 11:03.099
But we also found a
discarded hospital gown

11:03.167 --> 11:04.267
In his bathroom.

11:04.335 --> 11:05.502
And ronnie kalen's abductor

11:05.569 --> 11:06.836
Put a medical bracelet on her.

11:06.904 --> 11:09.539
We're talking about a
woman serving 15-to-life

11:09.606 --> 11:11.473
Who lied about the
disappearance of her husband.

11:11.541 --> 11:13.641
You know, she's probably on
with her attorney right now,

11:13.709 --> 11:15.209
Trying to leverage
this into a new trial.

11:15.277 --> 11:16.376
Come on, captain.

11:16.444 --> 11:17.744
The bracelet is too
much of a coincidence.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.178
If she's telling the truth
and that's in evidence--

11:20.246 --> 11:24.279
So I've got to call and rattle
the cages on a closed case?

11:24.347 --> 11:28.716
Oh, all right.
I'll talk to evidence.

11:28.784 --> 11:31.052
In the meantime, huh?

11:31.119 --> 11:33.620
Shake a leg on those other
killings that I got from vicap.

11:33.688 --> 11:36.056
Find stoddard and
show me something.

11:36.124 --> 11:37.557
Something that helps
build a profile

11:37.625 --> 11:39.259
On who this guy actually is.

13:10.654 --> 13:13.222
It's so interesting.
Look at this.

13:13.289 --> 13:15.723
Every time this guy gets
the ball, in the red,

13:15.791 --> 13:17.458
He stops at the top of the key,

13:17.526 --> 13:19.694
Fakes like he's gonna pass it,

13:19.762 --> 13:22.964
And then takes the shot
for himself, every time.

13:23.032 --> 13:26.000
You know, I'm not sure if
this is what callas meant

13:26.068 --> 13:28.302
When she said, "shake a leg."

13:28.369 --> 13:29.970
This is part of my routine.

13:30.038 --> 13:31.205
Helps me think.

13:31.272 --> 13:33.873
And you thought it
might help me think.

13:33.941 --> 13:35.842
No harm, no foul.

13:35.909 --> 13:37.510
Maybe it's just
one of those things

13:37.577 --> 13:40.478
That, uh, we don't have
in common, you know.

13:40.546 --> 13:41.646
But it is interesting.

13:41.714 --> 13:43.016
You know, if you watch these guys

13:43.084 --> 13:44.551
And their habits,

13:44.618 --> 13:47.619
You can kind of
predict the outcome.

13:47.687 --> 13:49.018
You know, I've never really been

13:49.086 --> 13:50.419
That much into basketball.

13:50.486 --> 13:52.452
No, it's not really
about basketball.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.818
It's about routine.

13:53.886 --> 13:55.951
Outcome, routine.
I need something more--

13:56.019 --> 13:57.619
Trust.

13:57.687 --> 14:00.088
Trust me.

14:00.155 --> 14:02.190
You can't see it.

14:02.257 --> 14:04.058
I can't see it yet.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.626
But it's in there.

14:06.694 --> 14:08.994
The kalens, the stoddards.

14:09.062 --> 14:10.197
Here.

14:10.265 --> 14:15.205
What might link them
is predictable routine.

14:15.273 --> 14:16.372
Huh.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.841
Mm-hmm. Here. Look at that.

14:18.909 --> 14:21.944
Every time, he takes it in.

14:22.012 --> 14:23.679
Puts it in.

14:23.747 --> 14:26.248
The stoddards. Their routine.

14:26.315 --> 14:27.382
I see that.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.950
Every Friday,
they worked on their boat.

14:29.018 --> 14:30.251
Yeah, yeah,
and for ronnie and lee,

14:30.319 --> 14:32.720
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, kick,

14:32.788 --> 14:36.056
Salsa dancing every Thursday.

14:36.123 --> 14:37.724
Which, by the way,
if the salsa place served alcohol,

14:37.792 --> 14:39.992
Was probably a violation
of her probation.

14:40.060 --> 14:42.327
- Probation?
- Yeah, ronnie kalen.

14:42.395 --> 14:44.095
Before she killed her husband,

14:44.163 --> 14:45.597
She had a prior for possession.

14:45.664 --> 14:48.032
Cocaine.

14:48.100 --> 14:52.836
Both couples had a routine.

14:52.904 --> 14:54.771
No, wait.

14:54.839 --> 14:57.707
No, both couples had
something in common.

14:57.775 --> 15:00.178
Ronnie kalen was seeing
a probation officer.

15:00.245 --> 15:02.513
The stoddards were
candidates to adopt.

15:02.580 --> 15:04.247
- Social services.
- Uh-huh.

15:04.315 --> 15:08.919
A social worker would
have access to addresses,

15:08.986 --> 15:12.991
Histories, details about
anybody in the system.

15:15.127 --> 15:18.929
But if the killer does
what ronnie kalen described,

15:18.997 --> 15:20.230
Why leave survivors?

15:20.298 --> 15:23.232
'cause it's all about choice.

15:23.300 --> 15:26.935
And killing them
invalidates the choice.

15:35.009 --> 15:37.075
Trust.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.780
Wow.

15:48.683 --> 15:50.851
- Detective?
- Huh?

15:50.919 --> 15:53.954
I had graphics make a
photo enlargement for you.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.054
Happy hunting.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.723
Thank you.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.258
Thanks.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.995
The hospital bracelet,
what does it mean?

16:03.063 --> 16:05.431
Uh, you're--you're
the linguistic savant.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.732
You tell me.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.436
I have no idea.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.304
Really?

16:13.371 --> 16:15.238
I thought you read arabic and--

16:15.306 --> 16:16.640
A language spoken
by millions of people.

16:16.707 --> 16:19.075
Only one person reads this one.

16:19.143 --> 16:21.477
Serena, I'm disappointed in you.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.145
Can I redeem
myself by telling you

16:23.212 --> 16:24.713
That ronnie kalen's
probation officer

16:24.781 --> 16:26.014
Is definitely not a suspect?

16:26.082 --> 16:28.382
Really? Going out
on a limb there?

16:28.450 --> 16:30.383
He died of pancreatic
cancer six months ago.

16:30.451 --> 16:31.584
Oh, and the stoddards?

16:31.651 --> 16:33.651
Their request to
adopt was approved

16:33.719 --> 16:35.718
By a county psychiatric evaluator.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.649
Name was dr. Abel hazard.

16:43.285 --> 16:44.919
"hazard, abel p.

16:44.986 --> 16:46.720
"d.O.B. 10/16/66.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.222
Current address,
17 east 81st street."

16:49.289 --> 16:51.591
Upper east side on a
social worker's salary?

16:51.658 --> 16:54.692
Holds title on a
2010 ford transit van.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.260
Sure doesn't seem
like the van type.

16:56.328 --> 16:57.628
Mm-mm.

16:57.696 --> 16:59.062
Check this.

16:59.130 --> 17:02.732
He reported over $3 million
in taxable income last year.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.034
Investment income
from a trust fund.

17:05.102 --> 17:08.907
Hmm. He's got rich
people's disease too.

17:08.976 --> 17:11.578
Yeah, he's cheap. Credit report.

17:11.645 --> 17:13.413
A judgment for stopping payment

17:13.480 --> 17:16.582
On a $5,000 check
to midland hardware.

17:16.650 --> 17:18.683
What's a milling lathe?
A milling lathe?

17:18.751 --> 17:21.551
It's a, uh, machine
used for woodworking.

17:21.618 --> 17:22.952
My uncle had one.

17:23.020 --> 17:25.488
Made a bunk bed for
me and my brother.

17:25.555 --> 17:26.922
I didn't know you had a brother.

17:26.990 --> 17:28.557
- Yeah.
- Younger or older?

17:28.625 --> 17:31.125
Older.

17:33.962 --> 17:37.464
We should get down to,
uh, social services.

17:38.733 --> 17:41.335
I-I don't recognize him, no.

17:41.403 --> 17:43.070
His name is ted stoddard.

17:43.138 --> 17:45.005
He and his wife wanted
to adopt and you--

17:45.073 --> 17:46.840
The stoddards, yes.

17:46.909 --> 17:48.878
Well, I accepted their
eligibility filing.

17:48.947 --> 17:50.081
Why? What's happened?

17:50.148 --> 17:51.985
Mrs. Stoddard was murdered.

17:52.052 --> 17:53.688
Her husband's missing.

17:53.755 --> 17:56.158
Oh, no.

17:56.225 --> 17:57.258
Whew.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.695
I...I only met them the,
the one time,

18:00.762 --> 18:02.362
By accident, on an elevator.

18:02.430 --> 18:04.697
Uh, they seemed like a nice couple.

18:04.765 --> 18:07.399
Our, our field workers
do the actual interviews.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.034
Sounds a little impersonal

18:09.102 --> 18:11.403
If you're determining who
qualifies for parenthood.

18:11.470 --> 18:12.437
Yeah.

18:12.504 --> 18:14.338
Department policy
frowns on any contact

18:14.406 --> 18:16.974
With the applicant until the
supervisor makes his decision.

18:17.042 --> 18:19.976
Mm-hmm.

18:20.044 --> 18:21.144
That sounds right.

18:21.212 --> 18:23.913
Uh, dr. Hazard, may I ask,

18:23.980 --> 18:25.914
Were you involved at all in a case

18:25.982 --> 18:27.683
With somebody named ronnie kalen?

18:27.750 --> 18:31.553
Uh, yes, that woman who
made up that bizarre story

18:31.621 --> 18:32.821
About her husband's shooting.

18:32.888 --> 18:35.956
I--I was interviewed by
a forensic psychiatrist

18:36.024 --> 18:37.891
Regarding her fitness
to stand trial.

18:37.959 --> 18:39.359
Actually, I meant before.

18:39.427 --> 18:41.661
She was convicted on
a prior drug charge

18:41.728 --> 18:44.228
And granted conditional probation.

18:44.296 --> 18:46.897
Mm, yeah, sorry, no.
I, I didn't handle that.

18:46.965 --> 18:50.067
Then why did the forensic
psychiatrist ask you about her?

18:50.134 --> 18:51.201
Oh, we were old friends.

18:51.269 --> 18:52.803
He wanted an extra set of eyes,

18:52.870 --> 18:53.904
So I weighed in.

18:53.972 --> 18:55.205
Nice.

18:55.273 --> 18:57.407
Wow, this is-
that's a beautiful desk.

18:57.475 --> 18:58.976
Oh, why, thank you.

18:59.043 --> 19:02.913
Yeah. Huh. Feel that.
Smooth as silk.

19:02.981 --> 19:06.116
It's yar.

19:06.184 --> 19:07.951
This whole building's
gray on gray.

19:08.019 --> 19:09.853
How did you wrangle this?

19:09.920 --> 19:11.888
Uh, my grandfather built it.

19:11.955 --> 19:15.590
My family manufactured
fine furniture in vienna.

19:15.658 --> 19:17.592
I've been told that albert speer

19:17.659 --> 19:20.128
Drafted his plans for the
olympic stadium on this desk.

19:21.430 --> 19:23.997
Really? Your grandfather
built this for him?

19:24.065 --> 19:26.765
It saved his life.
My father's too.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.533
They survived the camps together.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.268
Thanks.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.803
Airport police just
arrested ted stoddard

19:32.870 --> 19:35.072
At the private charter
terminal at jfk.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.083
Well, if I can be of any help...

19:45.151 --> 19:46.351
Thanks.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.887
Hmm.

19:56.863 --> 20:01.700
The timer was ticking
away and, uh...

20:01.767 --> 20:04.969
I was terrified and...

20:05.037 --> 20:08.973
I began screaming.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.774
And then I heard a shot.

20:10.842 --> 20:14.243
And, uh, my eyes were closed,

20:14.311 --> 20:18.980
But I--but I knew...

20:19.047 --> 20:23.449
I knew, because I was alive

20:23.517 --> 20:29.087
And I wished that I could die.

20:30.523 --> 20:32.824
You don't believe me.

20:32.893 --> 20:34.194
You don't believe me.

20:34.261 --> 20:36.968
We just need to hear everything.

20:37.035 --> 20:40.639
I loved linda.

20:40.706 --> 20:41.906
We were, uh...

20:41.974 --> 20:43.307
We were adopting a child.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.476
The little girl. We know.

20:45.543 --> 20:47.811
After the shot was fired,
what happened next?

20:47.879 --> 20:51.848
He just-- he walked over to the--

20:51.915 --> 20:53.849
The video cameras

20:53.917 --> 20:55.817
And he just-- he turned them off.

20:55.885 --> 20:57.652
He videotaped everything?

20:57.720 --> 20:58.653
I think so.

20:58.721 --> 21:00.388
There was, uh, the red light.

21:00.455 --> 21:01.856
It stopped blinking.

21:01.923 --> 21:05.292
And there were-
there were other machines,

21:05.360 --> 21:08.662
Measuring, uh, vitals,
and they were still going

21:08.729 --> 21:11.531
When I passed out.

21:11.599 --> 21:13.733
What's the next
thing you remember?

21:15.168 --> 21:19.472
I woke up in central park, naked,

21:19.539 --> 21:21.273
In a-- in a hospital gown.

21:21.341 --> 21:23.709
Hmm.

21:26.377 --> 21:28.978
Yes, this--

21:29.046 --> 21:30.546
It was in my pocket,

21:30.614 --> 21:31.780
And I gave it to the police.

21:31.848 --> 21:33.915
He had--he put it on my wrist.

21:33.983 --> 21:38.752
Actually, that comes off
of somebody else's wrist.

21:38.820 --> 21:39.886
This one is yours.

21:39.954 --> 21:42.521
They're identical.

21:45.192 --> 21:47.526
Then every...

21:48.861 --> 21:52.096
It really happened.

21:52.163 --> 21:54.064
You--you believe me.

21:54.132 --> 21:58.602
You--you believe that...

22:09.011 --> 22:10.411
There's too many left here.

22:10.479 --> 22:12.244
I mean, geez. He gets-
he gets it wrong here.

22:12.312 --> 22:13.377
There's too many of them left.

22:13.445 --> 22:15.809
See, milgram was a scientist

22:15.875 --> 22:19.909
Who set out to prove that
obedience to authority, uh,

22:19.977 --> 22:21.644
Overwhelms conscience.

22:21.711 --> 22:24.347
It established his preeminence
in social psychology.

22:24.415 --> 22:26.682
To make his mark, milgram designed

22:26.750 --> 22:30.586
This landmark essay
on human cruelty.

22:30.654 --> 22:35.891
An experimental subject is
told to shock an unseen person.

22:35.959 --> 22:38.294
Now when the subject resists,

22:38.362 --> 22:40.163
He is told he has no choice.

22:40.231 --> 22:41.899
He must obey orders.

22:43.468 --> 22:44.702
Wrong.

22:44.770 --> 22:47.205
195 volts.

22:47.272 --> 22:48.439
Dance.

22:48.507 --> 22:49.573
Aah!

22:49.641 --> 22:50.708
It all happened at yale.

22:50.776 --> 22:52.276
The screams came from actors,

22:52.344 --> 22:55.877
But the subjects believed
that they were real,

22:55.944 --> 22:57.944
That they were torturing people.

22:58.012 --> 23:00.512
Look, some of them even enjoyed it.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.113
How do I feel?
He was getting the shock.

23:02.180 --> 23:03.180
I feel all right.

23:03.247 --> 23:08.349
There will be intimacy.

23:08.416 --> 23:12.751
Here, let me just...

23:12.819 --> 23:15.019
Finish this...

23:15.087 --> 23:17.387
It's your five grand, hon.

23:17.455 --> 23:18.588
Whatever you want.

23:18.656 --> 23:19.789
Shock levels were
automatically recorded

23:19.857 --> 23:20.990
By an event recorder

23:21.058 --> 23:23.626
Wired directly into
the shock generator.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.028
That is incorrect.

23:25.095 --> 23:27.196
This will be a 330.

23:28.432 --> 23:29.533
Ow!

23:29.600 --> 23:30.868
All this fake screaming.

23:30.936 --> 23:33.637
You don't put people in
simulations of conflict.

23:33.705 --> 23:37.208
You put people in conflict.

23:43.691 --> 23:46.726
These are the dates
of these murders.

23:46.794 --> 23:49.361
Uh, the date when linda
stoddard was killed.

23:49.429 --> 23:51.830
This is when leeland
kalen was killed.

23:51.897 --> 23:54.263
Now, imagine that these
are a couple of sentences.

23:54.331 --> 23:55.431
Follow me.

23:55.499 --> 23:57.900
This symbol-- uh, this hand symbol,

23:57.968 --> 23:59.235
Is a gun.

23:59.302 --> 24:04.906
So, uh, this says,
"will ted shoot linda?"

24:04.974 --> 24:07.409
"will ronnie shoot leeland?"

24:07.477 --> 24:09.912
"in the" and these symbols

24:09.980 --> 24:11.715
Indicate where the
victim is to be shot,

24:11.782 --> 24:13.552
Depending on which is underlined.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.891
So the smiley face
represents the head.

24:15.959 --> 24:17.026
Yep.

24:17.094 --> 24:18.027
Pretty dark sense of irony.

24:18.095 --> 24:19.763
Yes. Dark, dark.

24:19.830 --> 24:23.669
Now this, uh,
closed file, underlined,

24:23.737 --> 24:24.870
Indicates that the killer

24:24.938 --> 24:27.373
Has finished
chronicling this event.

24:27.441 --> 24:30.176
Now this symbol,
it's a laptop camera.

24:30.243 --> 24:32.812
Underlined, it means
both these sessions

24:32.880 --> 24:34.316
Were visually recorded.

24:34.384 --> 24:36.487
Now, this--it drove
me absolutely nuts.

24:37.722 --> 24:40.057
"cts," underlined.
"cnts," not underlined.

24:40.125 --> 24:41.192
I had no idea.

24:41.260 --> 24:42.996
But it finishes both
these sentences.

24:43.066 --> 24:45.068
So now, watch this.

24:45.136 --> 24:46.837
"will ted shoot
linda in the heart?"

24:46.904 --> 24:49.606
"will ronnie shoot
leeland in the head?"

24:49.674 --> 24:52.575
Yes, he chose to shoot.

24:52.643 --> 24:55.211
Yes, she chose to shoot.

24:55.278 --> 24:59.081
But that doesn't match
what ronnie kalen said.

24:59.148 --> 25:03.251
In her case, he chose to shoot.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.722
Uh...

25:06.789 --> 25:08.457
I think only she lied.

25:08.525 --> 25:10.392
Yes, yes. She lied.

25:10.460 --> 25:13.662
She was given the choice,
and she shot her husband.

25:13.730 --> 25:15.430
She told it the other way

25:15.498 --> 25:17.899
To make herself seem more innocent.

25:20.303 --> 25:23.537
So who murdered these people?

25:23.604 --> 25:26.172
It's a convenient fiction.

25:26.239 --> 25:29.108
Innately, all human
behavior is self-serving.

25:29.175 --> 25:31.710
So love, caring for others,

25:31.778 --> 25:32.844
You deny that exists?

25:32.912 --> 25:33.845
What is this?

25:33.913 --> 25:36.380
Serena found this on youlens.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.081
Dr. Abel hazard.

25:38.149 --> 25:40.284
He published an
article on politics.

25:40.352 --> 25:41.886
His premise, freedom of choice

25:41.953 --> 25:44.254
Is contrary to human nature.

25:44.322 --> 25:47.157
- Simplify the choice-
- their life or someone else's--

25:47.224 --> 25:50.292
In a clinical, clean,
experimental environment,

25:50.360 --> 25:52.261
They will always choose survival.

25:52.329 --> 25:56.097
Dr. Hazard, if, god forbid,
you ever tested that theory,

25:56.165 --> 25:57.432
You'd be wrong.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.867
We're out of time, dr. Hazard.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.235
He's taught classes

26:01.303 --> 26:03.738
And given long-term social
services training seminars

26:03.806 --> 26:06.040
In all the places where
these killings occurred.

26:06.108 --> 26:07.274
And his experiment

26:07.342 --> 26:08.642
That he's almost going
to talk about there

26:08.710 --> 26:11.345
Is what he did to ted
stoddard and ronnie kalen.

26:11.413 --> 26:14.780
Forced them to make
this horrifying choice.

26:14.848 --> 26:16.915
Social services
worked well for him.

26:16.983 --> 26:18.617
He had access to everything.

26:18.684 --> 26:19.751
Wouldn't he have
put hospital bands

26:19.819 --> 26:21.252
On the victims as well?

26:21.320 --> 26:22.553
Oh, I think he did,
but he cut them off.

26:22.621 --> 26:24.588
And leave them on
living witnesses?

26:24.655 --> 26:25.822
That doesn't make sense.

26:25.890 --> 26:27.256
Yeah, well, I think he wants

26:27.324 --> 26:29.090
An element of credulity

26:29.158 --> 26:30.358
For the stories he
knew they'd tell,

26:30.425 --> 26:34.295
A hint of what only he
can reveal to the world.

26:35.898 --> 26:38.533
I'm gonna need a
search warrant, emma.

26:42.276 --> 26:45.780
Uh, kallman. Captain callas.

26:45.847 --> 26:48.383
No sign of foul play
or traces of blood.

26:48.451 --> 26:51.318
No abnormal levels of ammonia
or alkaloid phosphates.

26:51.386 --> 26:52.920
He didn't try to scrub evidence.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.955
The place is clean, captain.

26:56.023 --> 26:58.257
Thank you.

26:59.626 --> 27:04.164
clearly a disappointment.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.066
It's a beginning.

27:06.133 --> 27:07.667
Not unlike what you do.

27:07.735 --> 27:09.036
It starts with a premise.

27:09.103 --> 27:11.872
Without empirical proof,
it's nothing.

27:11.940 --> 27:14.509
We'll find it.

27:14.576 --> 27:16.977
We won't make it up.

27:20.515 --> 27:22.048
He won't stop.

27:22.116 --> 27:23.716
He thinks what he's
doing is very important.

27:23.784 --> 27:25.184
So does judge rickenbakker.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.785
He just granted mr. Hazard

27:26.853 --> 27:28.553
A cease-and-desist injunction

27:28.620 --> 27:30.821
Forbidding police surveillance.

27:30.889 --> 27:32.857
Well, you know, captain,

27:32.924 --> 27:34.725
The victims talk
about this wood smell

27:34.793 --> 27:35.826
And the heavy wooden chairs.

27:35.894 --> 27:37.094
He bought a milling machine.

27:37.161 --> 27:38.728
It's someplace.

27:38.796 --> 27:41.030
Yeah, well, whatever mr.
Hazard is doing

27:41.098 --> 27:42.865
Has some origin in his life.

27:42.932 --> 27:45.733
Now his parents,
his grandparents were survivors,

27:45.801 --> 27:49.502
So maybe, maybe we
start with the camps.

27:49.570 --> 27:51.738
Since abel hazard's
father and grandfather

27:51.806 --> 27:53.741
Were both survivors
of the holocaust,

27:53.809 --> 27:55.743
It's not such a wild guess to think

27:55.811 --> 27:57.712
That, uh, he might
be carrying around

27:57.780 --> 28:01.681
More furniture than just that desk.

28:03.316 --> 28:07.211
Hasam, mm, hazan...

28:07.279 --> 28:09.645
No--no hazard. Okay.

28:09.713 --> 28:13.239
What if "hazard" was a translation?

28:13.306 --> 28:15.370
Could be hebrew, or perhaps,
if he was sephardic,

28:15.438 --> 28:16.837
It could be ladino or spanish.

28:16.905 --> 28:18.505
But he doesn't look
sephardic. - No.

28:18.573 --> 28:20.607
Well, abel said that the
family business was in vienna,

28:20.675 --> 28:24.077
So I'm thinking maybe more
likely yiddish or german.

28:24.145 --> 28:26.579
Um...

28:26.647 --> 28:28.114
You know what I'm thinking about?

28:28.181 --> 28:30.481
You know when you-
-when you're driving in the alps

28:30.549 --> 28:32.782
On those icy roads, you see signs.

28:32.850 --> 28:35.317
You see signs with two words.

28:35.385 --> 28:36.352
"gefahr" is the last one.

28:36.419 --> 28:37.553
There's a word preceding it.

28:37.620 --> 28:38.721
It means "caution."

28:38.788 --> 28:40.789
"vorsicht," "vorsicht.
" type in "vorsicht."

28:44.593 --> 28:46.526
No "vorsicht,
" but "vorsichtiger."

28:46.594 --> 28:49.161
Leon, born September 24th, 1925.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.229
Oh, trade "cabinet maker."

28:51.297 --> 28:52.396
And he survived.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.598
Yeah, and he gives
an interview on tape.

28:54.666 --> 28:57.434
1976. Tape. This way.

28:57.501 --> 29:00.603
Dr. Kogel, he wanted him gone.

29:00.670 --> 29:02.705
But my father made a
dresser for an officer,

29:02.773 --> 29:04.340
And that officer decided

29:04.408 --> 29:06.775
My father was worth keeping alive.

29:06.843 --> 29:09.577
Dr. Kogel, he was a physician?

29:09.645 --> 29:11.179
Yes, they were all doctors

29:11.246 --> 29:14.048
Who picked who lived and who died.

29:14.116 --> 29:18.585
But later, herr dr. Kogel told me

29:18.653 --> 29:20.754
That one of my parents had to go,

29:20.822 --> 29:23.959
And I would decide which one.

29:24.027 --> 29:25.628
Hmm.

29:25.695 --> 29:27.496
But I couldn't.

29:27.564 --> 29:30.200
I wouldn't choose.

29:30.267 --> 29:31.768
And then kogel told this officer

29:31.836 --> 29:33.637
To shoot all three of us.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.140
But the officer--

29:36.208 --> 29:37.542
He interceded.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.710
Yeah, he shouted at my father.

29:39.778 --> 29:44.315
He demanded him to choose,
hmm? Him or my mother.

29:44.382 --> 29:46.449
Yes.

29:46.517 --> 29:49.284
Dr. Kogel enjoyed this game.

29:49.352 --> 29:53.287
What happened next?

29:53.355 --> 29:58.658
My father... Survived the camps.

30:01.929 --> 30:04.596
We do this to keep the
history from vanishing,

30:04.664 --> 30:06.897
But I wish it would vanish.

30:06.965 --> 30:11.900
Why, mr. Vorsichtiger?

30:11.967 --> 30:17.302
Oh, my son. I was so
happy when he was born.

30:17.370 --> 30:20.603
But as he grew older, well,

30:20.671 --> 30:23.105
There I was again, at age ten,

30:23.173 --> 30:25.908
Right in front of me.

30:25.976 --> 30:27.476
And it came back.

30:27.544 --> 30:29.144
The memory?

30:29.212 --> 30:32.814
No, the choice.

30:32.881 --> 30:35.949
I had to tell him

30:36.016 --> 30:39.318
My father's story,

30:39.386 --> 30:43.722
Make him know that under
some circumstances,

30:43.790 --> 30:47.358
There can be no shame.

30:51.397 --> 30:53.898
I think abel

30:53.966 --> 30:56.034
Wants everybody to
feel what he felt.

30:56.101 --> 30:57.702
He thinks that it's
something he can prove.

30:57.770 --> 31:00.271
- Take away his shame.
- Mm-hmm.

31:00.338 --> 31:02.439
So now we may have some
understanding of why.

31:02.507 --> 31:04.574
But we don't have proof.

31:04.642 --> 31:06.976
Altruism, loyalty,

31:07.044 --> 31:11.347
Even feelings of
profound affection vanish

31:11.415 --> 31:14.884
When faced with the
simple deductive choice

31:14.952 --> 31:16.653
Of life or death.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.354
I apologize.

31:18.422 --> 31:21.090
The selection process is extreme,

31:21.158 --> 31:22.158
But the rigors of science--

31:22.226 --> 31:23.859
Science? What?

31:23.927 --> 31:26.295
Instruments now
monitor your heart rate,

31:26.363 --> 31:28.631
Gsr, all vital signs.

31:28.699 --> 31:30.966
This is important.
What the hell are you doing?

31:31.034 --> 31:33.068
You--I'm explaining that.

31:33.135 --> 31:35.704
You are subjects

31:35.771 --> 31:39.641
In a socio-psychological
experiment.

31:39.709 --> 31:43.546
And since the last test was female,

31:43.614 --> 31:47.618
Tonight the subject is male.

31:47.685 --> 31:50.822
- No, no.
- Ted.

31:50.889 --> 31:53.357
he's going to kill us.

31:53.425 --> 31:57.762
Now, mr. Stoddard

31:57.829 --> 32:00.332
Will be presented
with a simple choice.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.070
He will have 25 seconds
in which to decide

32:03.138 --> 32:04.740
Between killing his wife

32:04.807 --> 32:08.118
Or being killed himself.

32:09.654 --> 32:11.627
T-t-t--

32:11.695 --> 32:13.901
No, no.

32:13.969 --> 32:15.740
T-t-ted.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.509
Ted. - 20 seconds.

32:17.577 --> 32:19.278
Ted, you can't do it, please.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.248
Ted!

32:23.316 --> 32:24.449
No!

32:25.785 --> 32:27.720
Aah!

32:43.007 --> 32:45.376
Hey. Hey, I hope you don't mind.

32:45.444 --> 32:47.313
I'm using your computer.

32:47.381 --> 32:50.351
Actually, I've made a discovery.

32:50.419 --> 32:51.886
Look at this.

32:51.954 --> 32:54.690
Uh, abel's birth was registered

32:54.758 --> 32:56.824
As abel vorsichtiger.

32:56.892 --> 32:59.829
He anglicized it to
hazard 15 years ago.

32:59.896 --> 33:02.063
And this is relevant because...

33:02.131 --> 33:05.032
As abel vorsichtiger,
four years ago,

33:05.100 --> 33:08.369
He bought a house in westchester.

33:08.436 --> 33:11.571
323 willow drive.

33:11.639 --> 33:13.206
Do I hear a train?

33:14.875 --> 33:17.410
You know, the use of a,
uh, different name

33:17.478 --> 33:20.113
Could give us probable
cause for a warrant.

33:20.181 --> 33:23.187
It's a hard sell,
but you with our captain,

33:23.254 --> 33:24.757
One on one, two women, you know.

33:24.824 --> 33:27.458
So I pull some gender thing

33:27.526 --> 33:28.926
And you're doing what?

33:28.994 --> 33:31.328
Going there and breaking in?

33:31.395 --> 33:34.563
You have my solemn
word I won't do that.

33:34.631 --> 33:38.433
Your solemn word?

33:38.502 --> 33:40.636
I guess it's time I tested that.

34:14.871 --> 34:16.539
Hmm.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.811
Alone?

34:24.647 --> 34:26.679
Yes, I am, actually.

34:26.748 --> 34:28.281
Hey, I just peeked.

34:28.349 --> 34:31.484
You do all this amazing work

34:31.551 --> 34:33.118
In the family tradition, do you?

34:34.786 --> 34:37.489
Yeah. Come.

34:37.556 --> 34:39.391
I'll give you the tour
while I call my lawyer

34:39.458 --> 34:42.659
And tell him you
violated the injunction.

34:42.726 --> 34:46.163
Seems a fair deal.

34:46.230 --> 34:49.364
I've got to apologize for
my lack of compassion.

34:49.433 --> 34:53.002
I saw the testimony
that your father gave.

34:53.070 --> 34:56.639
It's a story I've
heard many times before.

34:56.706 --> 34:59.674
Unfortunate that his
pain was passed to you.

34:59.742 --> 35:01.509
So it ends here.

35:01.577 --> 35:04.110
I don't have children.

35:04.178 --> 35:06.278
Still, you passed it to others.

35:10.418 --> 35:12.486
Ted stoddard, ronnie kalen.

35:12.554 --> 35:15.222
I-I feel sure that my legacy

35:15.289 --> 35:18.790
Will justify some inconvenience

35:18.858 --> 35:19.891
To a few individuals.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.192
Your legacy?

35:21.259 --> 35:23.526
You're not gonna have
any legacy in science.

35:23.594 --> 35:24.694
Is that what you're talking about?

35:24.762 --> 35:27.262
You're making judgments
about human nature

35:27.330 --> 35:28.696
Without any proof.

35:28.764 --> 35:30.331
There is proof,

35:30.399 --> 35:32.066
And when the time is right,
I will show it.

35:32.133 --> 35:33.566
When the time is right?
How about now?

35:33.634 --> 35:34.767
What's wrong with now? I'm here.

35:34.835 --> 35:36.301
I'm willing.

35:36.369 --> 35:40.704
Uh-huh, that's what I thought.

35:40.771 --> 35:42.205
Face it, you did two trials.

35:42.272 --> 35:44.606
Yes, ted stoddard shot his wife

35:44.673 --> 35:45.907
In order to save himself.

35:45.974 --> 35:49.242
It fits your theory.

35:49.310 --> 35:52.111
But leland kalen died

35:52.179 --> 35:54.479
Refusing to shoot his wife.

35:54.547 --> 35:55.880
They cancel each other out.

35:55.948 --> 35:57.581
So, inconclusive.

35:57.649 --> 35:59.816
Bauhaus, is this?

35:59.884 --> 36:02.219
Bauhaus? Werkbund.

36:02.286 --> 36:06.021
My grandfather could build
bauhaus in his sleep.

36:06.089 --> 36:10.358
Ugh. The junk that passes
for quality these days.

36:10.426 --> 36:14.499
There's no artistry.
There's no structure.

36:14.567 --> 36:16.536
It's--it's meaningless.

36:16.604 --> 36:18.005
Meaningless.

36:18.072 --> 36:22.181
Yeah, well, that brings
us back to your theory.

36:22.248 --> 36:27.185
You know, the social
sciences nowadays,

36:27.253 --> 36:29.720
With the blogs and kooky websites,

36:29.788 --> 36:30.922
Motivational speakers.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.823
None of that has any
bearing on what I do.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.159
You can't bolster
flawed theory, abel.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.861
Kammerer, with miller,
with him, I'm sure,

36:38.929 --> 36:40.529
Doctored those toads

36:40.597 --> 36:42.531
In order to disprove evolution.

36:42.599 --> 36:45.033
Lysenko faked his
results under stalin,

36:45.101 --> 36:46.968
Had all his critics murdered.

36:47.036 --> 36:49.704
Flawed science is no science.

36:49.772 --> 36:53.574
But my results are definitive.

36:57.814 --> 37:00.182
If I'm such a monster,

37:00.249 --> 37:02.717
Aren't you a little afraid?

37:05.354 --> 37:07.022
No.

37:07.089 --> 37:08.957
My mistake was
thinking that actually

37:09.025 --> 37:11.192
You maybe had something to hide.

37:11.260 --> 37:14.062
But you got no proof.

37:15.831 --> 37:19.067
I have recorded data.

37:19.134 --> 37:21.970
It has been checked and rechecked.

37:22.037 --> 37:25.339
Come on, if you had it,
you'd show it.

37:25.407 --> 37:29.010
Your so-called
experiments were a flop.

37:29.078 --> 37:32.380
All right.

37:35.684 --> 37:38.185
All right.

38:25.328 --> 38:27.463
20 seconds.

38:27.530 --> 38:29.965
Ronnie, no, please. It's me!

38:30.032 --> 38:31.933
Ronnie, no, no, no, no, no, no!

38:32.000 --> 38:33.767
No, ronnie, no! - I'm sorry!

38:33.835 --> 38:36.303
Ronnie, no! Oh, god, no!

38:36.371 --> 38:39.239
aah!

38:42.609 --> 38:44.610
Proof.

38:46.412 --> 38:49.547
Was it enough?

38:52.317 --> 38:57.788
In true science,
repeatability is everything.

39:02.894 --> 39:04.561
It's okay.

39:04.629 --> 39:05.729
There.

39:05.797 --> 39:07.398
It's okay, it's okay.

39:07.465 --> 39:08.799
It's okay.

39:10.034 --> 39:10.968
Aah!

39:19.544 --> 39:22.679
All done under the most
stringent of circumstances.

39:22.747 --> 39:24.982
Nothing manipulated or altered.

39:25.049 --> 39:29.420
Age, sex, religion, income, race,

39:29.487 --> 39:32.156
All painstakingly factored in.

39:32.223 --> 39:35.159
Five years, nine different cities.

39:35.226 --> 39:37.894
Out of ten trials,

39:37.962 --> 39:40.897
Only one subject shows
selfless altruism

39:40.965 --> 39:45.102
And that was only
because of their age.

39:45.169 --> 39:47.170
Yeah. You know who
observed that also?

39:47.238 --> 39:49.239
The nazis.

39:49.307 --> 39:50.574
And they recorded it.

39:50.641 --> 39:52.542
Just like you, it's their legacy,

39:52.610 --> 39:55.445
Which you have successfully
carried forward.

39:55.513 --> 39:57.547
No. This is my work.

39:57.615 --> 39:58.815
Your work?

39:58.883 --> 40:01.751
Dr. Kogel could have shown us this.

40:01.819 --> 40:04.320
Dr. Mengele with his
experiments on twins.

40:04.388 --> 40:05.789
These are my validations.

40:05.856 --> 40:08.725
They had validations
at a cost of suffering

40:08.793 --> 40:10.293
And human lives.

40:10.361 --> 40:13.797
And what did their
experiments prove, abel, huh?

40:13.865 --> 40:16.099
The nazi scientists,
what did their experiments prove?

40:16.167 --> 40:17.367
You have no right to--

40:17.435 --> 40:19.102
I have every right to compare
you to your colleagues.

40:19.170 --> 40:20.236
That much you have proven.

40:20.304 --> 40:21.938
What did your nazi colleagues...

40:22.006 --> 40:23.206
Give to science?

40:24.642 --> 40:26.042
The same thing that
you've given to science.

40:26.110 --> 40:27.977
Nothing. - No.

40:28.045 --> 40:31.180
After all of my work,
you cannot compare me with them.

40:31.248 --> 40:34.350
Just because you've
been brutalized by others

40:34.418 --> 40:37.721
Does not mean that brutalizing
others is compulsory.

40:37.789 --> 40:39.189
Maniac.

40:39.257 --> 40:41.157
And what happened to your family

40:41.225 --> 40:44.326
Is too unfathomably
complicated to even go into.

40:45.995 --> 40:47.762
What is all this?

40:47.830 --> 40:49.230
Part of this moron's efforts

40:49.297 --> 40:52.633
To prove something that,
in science,

40:52.700 --> 40:55.835
Failed miserably,
but is gonna be of great value

40:55.903 --> 40:57.103
In convicting him of murder.

40:57.171 --> 40:59.071
No.

40:59.139 --> 41:02.574
I have proven selfless
behavior is a myth.

41:02.642 --> 41:03.975
No one has a choice.

41:04.043 --> 41:07.612
Tell him about his choices.

41:07.679 --> 41:09.680
You may choose to remain silent.

41:09.748 --> 41:11.081
It is your right.

41:11.149 --> 41:13.483
You may also choose a lawyer.

41:13.551 --> 41:17.687
If not, one will be
provided for you.

41:19.489 --> 41:21.524
Ronnie kalen didn't waste any time.

41:21.591 --> 41:23.292
Let me guess.
She wants a new trial?

41:23.360 --> 41:25.428
And damages for the
time she's already served.

41:25.495 --> 41:26.429
Yeah.

41:26.496 --> 41:28.064
Come on, she's guilty.

41:28.131 --> 41:30.132
Well, you know,
it's a valid question

41:30.200 --> 41:33.135
How anybody'll act under
those circumstances.

41:33.203 --> 41:35.338
Are you buying into
abel hazard's theory?

41:35.405 --> 41:37.240
Certainly not.
People rush into fires.

41:37.307 --> 41:38.841
They jump in front of trains.

41:38.909 --> 41:40.910
They leap into
shark-infested waters.

41:40.978 --> 41:42.612
Who doesn't want to think

41:42.680 --> 41:44.748
That they could
sacrifice their own life

41:44.815 --> 41:46.316
To save somebody else's?

41:46.384 --> 41:48.151
It goes to the core
of our humanity, but--

41:48.219 --> 41:50.287
But no one knows what they'd do

41:50.354 --> 41:52.189
Until something actually happens.

41:52.256 --> 41:53.290
Yeah.

41:53.357 --> 41:55.492
Suddenly we find out
who we really are.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.929
But maybe it isn't
who we want to be.
