02:39.242 --> 02:40.289
Hey.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.504
- Working on a Saturday, too?
- Yeah.

02:43.580 --> 02:47.255
I'm sorry about the cheque last month.
I just...

02:47.334 --> 02:50.759
- No worries, man. We're square.
- Thanks.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.638
- Have a good weekend.
- All right, bud. Take care.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.519
Joanie?

03:45.517 --> 03:46.860
John Jr.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.006
Hello?

05:02.427 --> 05:03.770
Surprise!

05:05.388 --> 05:07.641
- God damn it!
- John.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.230
What the...

05:10.560 --> 05:14.485
- I'm sorry, just go to your room. Sorry, guys.
- It's okay, it's okay, guys.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.446
Sorry.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.912
Surprise.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.996
I really don't want to talk about it.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.248
You didn't sell the house, did you?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.006
No, I didn't.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.305
I did everything I could
and these people, they...

05:39.756 --> 05:41.929
You know, they just got cold feet.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.265
John, what are we gonna do?

05:44.344 --> 05:48.349
Well, I'm gonna get another listing,
and then I'll sell that house.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.941
And it'll be fine, just like we always are.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.147
Is that so?

05:57.107 --> 06:00.031
- You know, Joanie, I wish that...
- What?

06:00.110 --> 06:03.284
I wish you could put yourself
in my shoes for a minute

06:03.363 --> 06:05.866
to see the kind of pressure that I'm under.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.123
You know, what I go through every day.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.459
What is that gonna solve, John?

06:11.663 --> 06:14.291
I'm doing everything I can. Okay?

06:15.166 --> 06:18.796
- What if that's not enough?
- Well, it has to be.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.809
I'm gonna take the kids out.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.524
Honey, we can't afford it.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.156
Air is still free, John, last time I checked.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.367
I'm taking them to the park.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.330
Bye.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.081
Hey, monkeys, let's go. Let's go to the park.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.896
Coming.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.314
Yeah?

07:58.895 --> 08:03.275
Name's Richie.
My car stalled right in front of your house.

08:03.858 --> 08:08.409
Okay. What, you need to call AAA?
You need a phone?

08:08.697 --> 08:14.795
Well, you know, you don't get a welcome
like that nowadays. But, no, no.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.879
- Okay, well.
- Think maybe you can give me a push?

08:22.711 --> 08:24.679
Yeah, let's do it.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.052
Nice day, huh?

08:27.799 --> 08:29.051
Sure is.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.721
A day like today will make you forget
there's bad things in the world.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.681
Yeah, it's a nice day.

08:36.182 --> 08:40.028
The gas gets a little low in the carb
sometimes, like running on fumes.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.693
The gas station's down that way.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.777
Man, you should see this baby go.
Just smoke anything on the road.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.364
- Yeah, just let me know when, all right?
- All right. Push as hard as you can.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.620
Yeah, just let me know when.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.497
Ready?

08:56.786 --> 08:58.163
- No.
- Ready?

08:58.747 --> 09:01.876
All right, yeah. Go on, push!

09:01.958 --> 09:04.928
Yeah, I'm doing the best I can.
Give me a second.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.382
Come on! Push <i>as</i> hard as you can.
You got some muscle on you, boy.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.550
Okay, just tell me when.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.145
- You ready?
- Okay, do it. Drop the clutch.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.520
- Come on, push faster!
- What are you waiting for?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.192
Push faster!

09:19.934 --> 09:22.528
- You ready?
- Okay, do it. Drop the clutch.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.408
Jesus, hey, you know what you're doing?

09:31.237 --> 09:34.411
God fucking damn it!

09:35.909 --> 09:36.956
Fuck!

09:42.373 --> 09:44.341
What the fuck are you thinking?

09:45.418 --> 09:48.262
I could teach you a few things
about common fucking courtesy.

09:48.338 --> 09:52.184
- Is that right?
- Yeah, fucking leg, Jesus!

10:10.276 --> 10:12.870
- Better get you to a hospital.
- I'm fine.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.664
Don't look fine to me.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.586
- Let me give you a hand.
- Man, I don't need any help.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.626
I beg to differ.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.294
- Come on. Easy does it.
- Fuck.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.592
Look, I got you.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.641
You and me, we're in this thing together.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.692
I'm okay.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.992
- Like riding on air, right?
- Yeah.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.914
- That's what I'm saying.
- Easy, Ricky.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.541
- Richie.
- Rich.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.753
- Wow, you really got hurt.
- Yeah.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.010
- It's all my fault.
- Not your fault.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.008
- You're not blaming me?
- No.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.465
Well, never would have happened
if I hadn't come knocking on your door.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.347
Hey, listen, I wanted to help you. Okay?

11:16.759 --> 11:18.807
What is it you do,
if you don't mind me asking?

11:18.887 --> 11:20.434
I'm in real estate.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.187
- Used to be.
- What do you mean "used to be"?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.529
Hey, hey, but I bet you glad it happened,
all right?

11:29.147 --> 11:33.448
It's "customer's always right."
That sort of shit don't suit a man like you.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.245
It is a racket.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.957
Everything's a racket.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.124
Should I kick it in?

11:44.579 --> 11:49.380
- I thought you said you were out of gas.
- No, no, no. I just said I stalled.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.304
- Okay.
- Let me give her some juice.

11:57.217 --> 12:03.350
Now that, my friend,
is 450 cubic inches of American metal.

12:04.849 --> 12:08.479
Four 4-barrel carburettors spitting mad fuel!

12:08.561 --> 12:11.565
This bitch is a fuck beast!

12:14.400 --> 12:16.198
Yeah, this baby can fly!

12:16.319 --> 12:18.993
You're... Watch it, watch it, watch it.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.412
See this guy? This truck, man!

12:22.075 --> 12:23.327
Fuck, watch out!

12:24.327 --> 12:26.625
Who <i>says</i> American cars can't handle?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.341
Those brakes can be a little loose sometimes.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.767
- Scary as hell.
- Yeah.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.557
Look like you were having fun, though.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.805
I don't know if fun's the word, but, yeah,

12:43.888 --> 12:46.357
I guess I needed it
a little more than I thought I did.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.356
- Think I didn't know that?
- Yeah?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.945
There's a looker.

12:55.858 --> 12:56.905
Yeah, she is.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.077
Pity. She ain't got a clue.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.621
Seems nice enough.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.587
I don't know, baby.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.084
Fill her up?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.050
Stupid bitch.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.308
What'd she do to you?

13:20.675 --> 13:23.554
Chewing gum at work,
that's just fucking rude.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.813
- Nice house you got there, John.
- Thanks.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.019
Bet you got a nice-looking wife.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.571
Maybe a couple of nice kids.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.733
I say, you got kids?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.989
Yeah. I got a girl and a boy.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.872
Not me, John.
Never cared much for pets, either.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.995
- So, how do you know my name?
- You told me.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.501
Yeah?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.212
Only needed two gallons.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.393
- Got some ID?
- What for?

14:09.307 --> 14:13.357
- It's just normal procedure.
- No, no, no. No, John. John, I got this.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.940
So, what's the problem?
You don't like the way I look?

14:17.023 --> 14:18.070
Hey, you know.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.368
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.238
Pay my manager inside, sir.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.017
You know what? You and me,

14:44.717 --> 14:46.811
- we're a lot alike, you know?
- That so?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.559
- Yeah, that's so.
- Yeah.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.353
- You'll see. Just pay attention.
- Okay.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.934
You'll find out what I'm saying.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.945
Let me take care of this.
I'll take you straight to the hospital.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.067
Got it.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.453
- Everything go okay?
- All good.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.747
Got the gas for free on account of that cunt.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.545
The hospital's the other way.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.748
Yeah, you said yourself
you're not hurt that bad.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.881
You know, man, I'm fine. Just take me home.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.804
Let me buy you a drink. It's the least
I could do for what I put you through.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.223
It's the middle of the day.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.555
Come on, you've been drinking already.
I can smell it. Scotch.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.638
It's my drink.
Come on, man, one more won't kill you.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.998
- So, you can't park there.
- I just did.

16:35.203 --> 16:38.332
- You need a permit, that's the thing.
- You're hurt, right?

16:38.414 --> 16:40.257
Ain't that the definition of handicap spot?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.043
Just act like a cripple. We'll be all right.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.470
Okay.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.300
Where you going?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.098
How about that drink?

16:51.302 --> 16:53.725
If you don't want to have a drink with me,
all you got to do is say so.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.683
- Look.
- You know...

16:56.766 --> 17:00.487
I know, I can behave
a little strangely sometimes.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.610
Just because I'm a little different
doesn't make me a bad guy.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.154
I don't think you're a bad guy. It's just...

17:06.442 --> 17:08.661
I just gotta get home. That's all. My wife.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.070
Wife.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.086
Careful.

17:26.796 --> 17:30.300
The damn shitter's broken again.
Plumber's late as usual.

17:30.466 --> 17:34.061
Yeah, I'm always waiting for the muffin man.

17:35.805 --> 17:40.561
Well, you just get your tight little trucker ass
on in here before I cream my shorts.

17:40.643 --> 17:42.862
And that's a big 10-4.

17:43.271 --> 17:46.525
- Sorry, hi.
- How can I help you?

17:46.607 --> 17:50.111
May I borrow your phone?
I just gotta make a quick call.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.662
Pay phone's at the bar.

17:52.113 --> 17:55.333
Okay, well, it's...
I just gotta call my wife, it's local.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.160
Pay phone's at the bar.

17:59.662 --> 18:03.417
Okay, so, give me your cheapest phone,
I guess.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.798
Last one. Cash or credit?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.889
Look, I'm really sorry. I don't have my wallet.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.888
- If you just let me use the phone...
- Pay phone's at the bar.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.104
Lady, I haven't seen a pay phone in years.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.556
- I'm just trying to...
- Not my problem.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.189
Okay, look, I'll just...

18:31.068 --> 18:34.823
You know, Rhonda, for somebody
in the communications business,

18:34.905 --> 18:37.374
I think you could afford to learn
a little common courtesy.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.039
Fuck you.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.546
- How's that for common courtesy?
- All right.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.548
Grow some balls.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.237
Actually, I'd just like to use your phone,
if that's okay.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.540
Jesus Christ!

19:22.119 --> 19:24.793
- John. What are you doing here?
- Hey, Trevor.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.625
L just need to use the phone. Sorry.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.172
You look like hell.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.462
Yeah, I've been better.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.929
You know, listen, John,
it wasn't all my decision.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.638
So, whose was it?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.399
Corporate downsizing.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.105
You just weren't pulling your weight.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.745
Walk away, John, like you always do.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.950
Come on, man.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.827
Johnny, come on
and have a drink with us, man.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.873
- My man. I knew you'd be back.
- Yeah.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.920
There ain't no harm in being polite.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.504
Don't worry about me.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.588
You should worry about the fat ass
across the street at the phone store.

20:13.671 --> 20:17.141
Yeah, or my jack-off boss
who just spilled a beer on me.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.263
I'm fine, though.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.765
You mean the bastard who canned you?
He's here?

20:20.845 --> 20:23.598
Yeah, yeah, that's the very guy. He's here.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.315
He's holding court.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.190
I say we go in there
and kick his head inside out.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.943
I shouldn't even have mentioned it. It's fine.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.319
Yeah, I'd like to make a collect call...

20:33.691 --> 20:35.489
Let me loan you a quarter.
It's the least I can do.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.868
I'm fine. It's okay.
Yeah, my name's John Felton.

20:41.615 --> 20:45.290
<i>Hi, it's the Feltons.
We're not home, so leave a message.</i>

20:45.995 --> 20:48.919
You should never tell people
you ain't home on your answering machine

20:49.039 --> 20:50.086
Yeah?

20:50.583 --> 20:53.257
So what exactly is your interest
in my business?

20:53.377 --> 20:54.629
I'm just trying to help you out here.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.010
That's what they're looking for. Suckers.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.099
Well, thanks for the warning.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.003
John?

22:10.621 --> 22:14.592
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. I'm just leaving.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.510
Come on, one drink.

22:16.585 --> 22:20.681
No, actually, I gotta call Joanie.
I need a ride. I gotta get home.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.722
I can drive you home.

22:30.558 --> 22:33.277
I just gotta use the pisser first.
I'll meet you outside.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.646
Yeah, I don't know if that's such a good idea.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.070
- What? Taking a piss?
- No, that's not what I meant.

22:39.149 --> 22:42.653
- John, it's just a ride home
- Okay.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.388
Gotcha.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.184
You okay?

23:10.431 --> 23:12.183
- Yeah.
- What's...

23:12.266 --> 23:14.439
Could have sworn I parked right around here.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.613
- You don't know where you...
- There it is.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.205
So, Tammy, are you okay to drive?

23:28.574 --> 23:31.418
I'm a teensy bit wasted,
so maybe you'd better.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.619
Thanks.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.216
You know I broke up with Trevor
to be with you.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.884
Yeah, and he fired me.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.128
Is that what you care about?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.054
Look, Tammy.

23:43.464 --> 23:46.388
You know, what we did was wrong, okay?

23:46.717 --> 23:48.390
- For who?
- My family.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.221
Fucking cowards.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.649
You know, that stupid fat ass wouldn't
let me make a phone call neither.

23:53.724 --> 23:54.976
Said she didn't like the way I looked,

23:55.059 --> 23:57.858
and she kept stuffing doughnuts
down her blabber box.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.861
It looked like she'd been locked
in a doughnut shop her whole life.

24:00.940 --> 24:01.987
Yeah.

24:02.066 --> 24:05.741
Man gets his dream car towed by the pigs,

24:06.278 --> 24:09.578
gets treated like a criminal
by an incompetent...

24:10.240 --> 24:12.413
- Where's your common courtesy?
- Exactly.

24:12.493 --> 24:13.836
- I should have listened to you.
- I know.

24:13.911 --> 24:16.755
You tried to warn me
about these parking rules.

24:17.539 --> 24:18.916
But what a car though, right?

24:19.166 --> 24:22.511
Pure American muscle.
You could feel that power, right?

24:22.586 --> 24:23.633
I sure did.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.965
You feel it right between your legs.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.808
- It's a muscle car.
- Is that so?

24:27.925 --> 24:30.098
Yeah, that is so, missy. Right, John?

24:30.427 --> 24:33.101
- It's a great car, I'll give you that.
- You know what I'm talking about.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.932
- John, you know this guy?
- Yeah, we...

24:35.015 --> 24:37.689
I really, really hate to ask this,

24:37.768 --> 24:39.645
because of everything
we've already been through,

24:39.728 --> 24:42.231
but you think you can give me
a ride to the impound?

24:43.148 --> 24:45.617
I don't think so,
'cause I gotta get home and...

24:45.818 --> 24:47.616
I gotta get home, too!

24:47.987 --> 24:50.410
I'm just like you, John. I'm stranded.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.867
- I don't even know where the impound is.
- I do!

24:52.950 --> 24:55.703
I do! It's not far. Scout's honor.

24:55.869 --> 24:59.669
See, it's not my car,
and I gotta take her home.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.635
Name's Richie. I would really appreciate it.

25:05.254 --> 25:08.349
- Well, if John will vouch for you.
- Course he'll vouch for me!

25:10.426 --> 25:12.895
- Right, John?
- Yeah, I mean, we met earlier...

25:12.970 --> 25:16.019
- So, how do you two know each other?
- We work together.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.817
- Work buddies?
- We work together.

25:20.936 --> 25:24.031
- Wanna give him a ride'?
- It's fine. We'll give you a ride.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.322
Yeah, we'd better hurry. Looks like rain.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.400
- So, we close?
- Think so.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.239
You think so?

26:06.857 --> 26:09.110
- Man, you even know where it is?
- Yeah.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.453
'Cause we've been driving
for like a half hour,

26:11.528 --> 26:13.530
and you just said it was a couple miles.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.579
You're a slow driver, John.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.373
Look, SO.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.999
- You two really work together?
- That's right.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.880
John tell you he got fired today?

26:27.252 --> 26:29.050
Canned, like a sardine.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.804
Bet you didn't even tell your wife,
did you, John'?

26:33.383 --> 26:34.430
I told my wife.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.140
The truth hurts.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.063
Do you want me to pull over?
Would you like to walk?

26:38.138 --> 26:40.812
Ain't your car. From what I could see,

26:41.141 --> 26:42.984
Tammy here makes all the rules.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.817
- Don't be a cocktease, baby.
- Hey.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.524
Nothing like a pair of blue balls
to drive a man insane.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.701
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.575
She made her own bed, John. That she did.

26:53.654 --> 26:54.746
And what's that supposed to mean?

26:54.822 --> 26:56.665
Well, honey, you dig a hole in a man's life,

26:56.740 --> 26:58.742
you can't expect not to be buried in it.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.921
- What did you tell him, John?
- I didn't tell him anything.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.628
Pull over. You're a piece of shit.

27:08.502 --> 27:09.799
What is this guy doing?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.760
Don't speed up, slow down. Drive him crazy.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.846
Man, would you shut up?
I'm gonna pull over.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.053
You're a pussy, John.
Can't stand up for yourself.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.480
- Just let me handle this, okay?
- Yeah, boss.

27:22.015 --> 27:25.064
- Shit, goddamn!
- Bastard's wrecking my car, John!

27:25.269 --> 27:26.737
I didn't do anything.
I don't know what this guy's...

27:26.812 --> 27:28.109
You must have done something.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.486
- Maybe he saw you leaving town.
- So what?

27:30.983 --> 27:33.827
You said you picked a fight
with that fat ass in the phone store, right?

27:36.822 --> 27:38.039
You want to fight, then fight!

27:39.658 --> 27:41.660
What did you do to that woman back there?

27:42.744 --> 27:45.497
Just gave her a piece of my mind.
Same <i>as</i> you. No different.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.962
Except I didn't tuck it between my legs.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.054
John, what are you doing?
Slow down. Just let him go.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.482
- Write his plate down, he can't do that.
- That's the spirit.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.656
- Let's rip his fucking throat out.
- Just let me handle it.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.912
- That guy was trying to kill us, John.
- Just stay in the car.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.709
Don't do something stupid.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.628
Fuck's this guy's problem?

28:25.204 --> 28:27.332
Hey! You could have killed us!

28:29.917 --> 28:31.385
You ran us right off the road!

28:31.752 --> 28:32.799
What the fuck?

28:32.878 --> 28:34.300
You could have killed us,
do you understand that?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.052
Wait, wait, stop the car! Let me out.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.272
Look! I don't want any problems!
It's just that was really dangerous.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.894
Saw you drive off after you killed my girl.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.816
Look, this is all a mistake. Just take it easy.

28:46.892 --> 28:47.984
Watch it!

28:53.774 --> 28:54.900
Fuck.

28:57.861 --> 28:58.908
Fucking bull's-eye!

29:00.572 --> 29:03.667
Come on, get in the car. Let's go. Come on.

29:05.494 --> 29:08.168
You can't do anything for him now.
We killed him.

29:08.538 --> 29:11.667
- We didn't do this. You did this!
- I saved your life.

29:11.875 --> 29:16.756
We are in this together, John, like I said,
whether you like it or not.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.886
Tammy, where's your phone?

29:19.549 --> 29:21.096
It's in my bag.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.474
He's alive, but just barely!

29:26.765 --> 29:28.017
So, what do you owe him?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.148
- It's not in here! Where's her phone?
- How would I know?

29:30.227 --> 29:32.321
Because you took it out of her bag
when you were in the back seat!

29:32.396 --> 29:34.364
- Now, where is it?
- You expect me to admit to that?

29:34.439 --> 29:37.033
Hey, don't mistake my kindness
for weakness. I'm warning you!

29:37.109 --> 29:38.156
Really?

29:38.944 --> 29:41.117
What should I mistake it for?

29:52.582 --> 29:54.175
I really smashed him.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.967
Like a stupid fucking cockroach.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.718
Come on, let's go. Come on!

30:03.468 --> 30:04.765
We gotta find a phone.

30:17.899 --> 30:20.493
We got nine murders,
and I don't even have a witness.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.905
Somebody has to have seen something.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.832
- Find me that somebody.
- Sir.

30:26.116 --> 30:27.163
Found somebody.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.214
John, turn here.

31:01.735 --> 31:04.238
Hello? Is anyone home?

31:12.913 --> 31:13.960
Fuck.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.917
- Why don't you just kick it in?
- Just take it easy.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.002
You're the one that said
the guy needs an ambulance.

31:22.255 --> 31:26.510
Hello? Look, there's been an emergency,
a man's hurt very badly.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.182
We need to use your phone.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.482
Hello, is anyone home?

31:36.061 --> 31:37.153
Hello?

31:58.417 --> 31:59.509
Richie.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.654
Is anybody home?

32:28.155 --> 32:30.704
Look. It's half full. Help yourself.

32:30.782 --> 32:31.874
It's called stealing.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.295
It's called a drink.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.249
Look, now, you do what you want.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.552
L just want you to know,
I'm telling the police everything.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.512
That's it.

33:07.068 --> 33:08.490
Is there somebody home?

33:09.988 --> 33:13.663
<i>- Ma'am? Hello? Hello?
- Is this the police?</i>

33:13.742 --> 33:16.086
Look, there's been a terrible accident.

33:16.203 --> 33:19.548
<i>Sir, I would like for you
to leave the premises right now.</i>

33:19.664 --> 33:24.010
Listen, we need an ambulance.
Highway 111, 20 miles east of town,

33:24.085 --> 33:26.087
there's a guy dying on the road.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.178
<i>We do have a squad car on the way.</i>

33:30.425 --> 33:33.679
<i>- Sir, sir, please identify yourself.
- My name's John Felton.</i>

33:33.762 --> 33:37.767
I'm fine, but there's a man
dying in the middle of 111.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.692
Send an ambulance right...

33:55.909 --> 33:57.456
Is anybody home?

33:58.286 --> 33:59.458
Is anybody here?

34:15.469 --> 34:16.596
Hello?

34:39.452 --> 34:42.956
You're still here? Call the cops?

34:45.792 --> 34:47.135
Is she okay?

34:49.170 --> 34:50.295
She who?

34:51.840 --> 34:54.342
There was a woman on the phone. All right?

34:54.467 --> 34:57.311
I heard the woman on the phone.
I know there's somebody here.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.855
Is she okay?

35:00.307 --> 35:05.529
You know, I bet your place
is a lot more tidy than this trap.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.864
Maybe you could invite me over sometime.

35:13.361 --> 35:16.456
Sure, why not? Yeah.

35:17.032 --> 35:21.833
You know I would behave
like a guest in your house.

35:24.039 --> 35:27.714
Maybe I could come over for dinner when
this is all over, and we can have a laugh.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.133
Yeah, that sounds good.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.220
"That sounds good, Richie.
Sure, yeah, come over."

35:34.466 --> 35:37.640
- Look, don't talk down to me, John.
- I'm not. I'm not.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.643
You'd better say what you mean

35:40.722 --> 35:44.226
and stop barking out
a bunch of meaningless phrases.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.528
I mean it. I do.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.983
Okay, I mean it.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.235
All right? It's okay.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.746
- Yeah. It's okay.
- Good.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.912
I'm gonna hold you to that.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.248
No.

36:02.827 --> 36:07.003
Listen, you'd be our guest. Okay?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.588
Just please...

36:21.888 --> 36:24.437
There's nothing you can do for her now.

36:28.353 --> 36:32.574
You turned your back on things
your whole life, John.

36:33.858 --> 36:37.783
One more time won't kill you. Will it?

36:38.947 --> 36:41.791
Listen, you told me
that there was nobody in the house.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.623
You knew better than that.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.543
You gotta trust
your own best instincts, John.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.545
If you don't, you're not gonna make it.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.044
It's up to you.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.835
- It's okay.
- What's going on?

37:29.956 --> 37:32.334
It's all right.
We're gonna get out of here, all right?

37:32.417 --> 37:34.670
Stick with me, okay'? Okay.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.302
I have a shotgun! And I know how to use it.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.265
Kid.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.183
Don't do that!

37:41.259 --> 37:43.762
Put it down, all right?
We're just trying to help.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.602
Where's my grandma?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.815
- She...
- Richie, don't.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.863
- She ain't here.
- Back the fuck up!

37:55.190 --> 37:57.033
She wanted me to tell you something.

37:57.358 --> 37:58.655
- Richie.
- Something

37:59.652 --> 38:00.869
she wanted you to know.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.992
You see that field over there?

38:07.160 --> 38:10.209
Now, I'm gonna give you a chance to run

38:10.830 --> 38:13.333
But your grandma wanted me to tell you

38:13.875 --> 38:17.721
I'm gonna be coming after you. Get.

38:21.174 --> 38:24.599
Richie, please, just stop.
It's not a game any more.

38:24.761 --> 38:27.014
- Please, just...
- What makes you think so?

38:27.889 --> 38:31.189
Please, I'm just asking you, that's all.
I'm just asking.

38:31.851 --> 38:32.898
Okay.

38:34.395 --> 38:38.946
- I'm sorry, please just...
- John, let's go. He's not gonna hurt us.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.444
You think not?

38:41.861 --> 38:43.204
I'm not afraid of you.

38:43.613 --> 38:44.865
You ought to be.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.542
Jesus, Tammy. Tammy.

38:47.742 --> 38:48.743
<i>Jesus.</i>

38:49.577 --> 38:50.578
Tammy.

38:50.703 --> 38:52.751
Tammy. Tammy.

38:58.253 --> 39:01.427
I bet she does things
your wife would never do.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.427
- I wouldn't know.
- Well, what's your wife like, John?

39:04.801 --> 39:07.395
If you don't tell me, I'll find out for myself.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.556
She means everything to me.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.145
Right.

39:12.058 --> 39:16.063
But I'm sure there's times
you'd like to kill her though, right?

39:17.146 --> 39:18.238
No.

39:19.399 --> 39:21.652
But I'd kill anybody that tried to hurt her.

39:24.445 --> 39:25.822
I understand that.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.587
Things that I hate most are things that

39:33.788 --> 39:36.166
resemble my own faults.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.551
I hate bad manners.

39:38.626 --> 39:43.928
I hate people
that don't give common courtesy.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.929
Hypocrites and cowards. That's all they are.

39:55.977 --> 39:59.402
If you try anything, I will beat her

39:59.480 --> 40:02.108
till she bleeds brains out of her eyes.
You understand?

40:02.442 --> 40:04.536
Why don't you just let us go, all right?

40:04.652 --> 40:07.451
We won't say a word.
It'll be like it never happened.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.834
But it is happening, John.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.829
It's happening right now.

40:17.165 --> 40:21.796
Stop trying to figure me out.
I got my own ideas.

40:37.518 --> 40:40.863
Tammy, you gotta get up right now.
You gotta get out of here, okay?

40:40.980 --> 40:43.199
He's gonna try and kill that cop.
I gotta save him. Come on.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.204
Here. Just go wait for me on this field.

41:32.907 --> 41:36.286
Look, you just gotta keep moving
towards town, okay'?

41:36.411 --> 41:38.413
No, no, I don't want to leave you.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.587
Look, you'll be faster without me, okay?

41:42.542 --> 41:43.919
That's not what I mean.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.389
Look, go, okay? Just go.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.623
This used to be a nice neighbourhood.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.922
Nice dog, still.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.345
Rich folks been acting all crazy lately.

42:28.087 --> 42:30.089
Like they ain't never been broke before.

42:30.673 --> 42:32.675
So, what else have we got on this guy?

42:32.842 --> 42:37.313
Mr. fucking Rogers is what we've got.
Good job, wife, two kids.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.269
Real estate agent.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.602
Real family man.

42:42.852 --> 42:47.449
Well, being a real family man doesn't
automatically make you a nice guy.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.823
<i>Forty-three, I got another 28.</i>

42:52.612 --> 42:53.659
I guess not.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.910
<i>My name's John Felton. I'm fine,</i>

42:58.993 --> 43:02.668
<i>but there's a man dying in the middle of 111.
Send an ambulance right...</i>

43:03.998 --> 43:06.342
- Is that his voice?
- Yes.

43:11.714 --> 43:12.966
Do you mind?

43:14.509 --> 43:15.556
Absolutely.

43:20.973 --> 43:24.022
If you were guessing,
where do you think he's going?

43:27.647 --> 43:30.150
Is there someone else he would turn to?

43:31.192 --> 43:34.662
- Another woman?
- I apologise for asking.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.331
I don't think so.

43:38.866 --> 43:40.334
At least not any more.

43:40.827 --> 43:42.750
Got a name? A phone number?

43:43.746 --> 43:44.838
Sorry.

43:45.706 --> 43:50.382
He left a bar with a young girl.
Brown hair. Busty.

43:51.379 --> 43:52.551
Ring any bells?

43:52.839 --> 43:57.720
If my husband was at a bar
with some slut with huge tits,

43:58.177 --> 44:00.726
why would he call me collect
from a pay phone'?

44:00.930 --> 44:02.682
To spread the good news?

44:03.224 --> 44:06.899
Does he generally drink
in the middle of the day?

44:07.019 --> 44:08.692
No, not usually.

44:09.355 --> 44:12.029
Sir, please be careful. Thank you.

44:12.900 --> 44:17.906
Do you know someone
who would have picked him up?

44:19.073 --> 44:20.746
All our friends are gone.

44:21.534 --> 44:26.415
Fired, relocated or just up and quit.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.255
Tough times. People losing everything.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.133
Holding on by their teeth.

44:33.754 --> 44:36.257
And that's why John and I
stand together to stay strong.

44:36.549 --> 44:39.849
If nobody picked him up,
why is his car still in the driveway?

44:39.927 --> 44:42.601
Wallet, cell phone,
keys left by the front door.

44:42.763 --> 44:45.266
<i>Glass</i> of whisky
broken on your kitchen floor?

44:46.142 --> 44:47.735
You guys have an argument?

44:47.935 --> 44:51.109
He was disappointed
he didn't sell a house today.

44:51.731 --> 44:54.450
He ever hurt you

44:55.735 --> 44:57.157
when he gets disappointed?

44:57.778 --> 44:58.825
No.

45:01.949 --> 45:04.293
You think he really killed those people?

45:05.244 --> 45:06.621
Could have.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.798
Do you need someplace to stay?

45:13.419 --> 45:14.966
We have a beautiful home.

45:18.799 --> 45:20.096
Do you think she's hiding something?

45:21.344 --> 45:23.312
We could always look on the bright side.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.143
She's ignorant?

45:26.641 --> 45:30.691
People snap sometimes. No good reason.

45:30.811 --> 45:36.318
You take your average, ordinary person
and rob him of everything he cares about.

45:36.442 --> 45:37.694
Then, people snap.

46:50.016 --> 46:52.519
So, now, you want my help.

46:53.227 --> 46:57.027
Well, well, well, right back where we started.

46:57.565 --> 47:02.071
Except you look a little worse for wear,
if you don't mind me saying.

47:03.029 --> 47:05.248
I got this instinct, John.

47:05.406 --> 47:09.036
There's just no denying it.
It's a God-given attribute, really.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.541
I am always right

47:11.871 --> 47:14.420
when it comes to people
who are trying to do me harm.

47:15.291 --> 47:18.420
- I'm not trying to harm you.
- Well, if you are,

47:19.420 --> 47:21.047
I just want you to know,

47:21.881 --> 47:24.225
you ain't seen nothing yet.

47:26.135 --> 47:30.436
I know what you did.
I know you hurt those people.

47:30.890 --> 47:33.609
The world hurts people, John.

47:34.310 --> 47:36.108
I come in after the hurt.

47:36.479 --> 47:40.234
All I do is kill people who are already dead.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.911
Come on. Get up.

47:44.403 --> 47:45.620
Get up.

47:49.617 --> 47:52.291
And no funny stuff this time, see?

47:52.411 --> 47:55.460
'Cause I'll fill you full of holes, pal.

47:59.627 --> 48:02.631
Now, there's a roadblock up ahead.

48:03.964 --> 48:07.764
You're gonna drive through it,
just like you're one of them.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.813
Get to driving.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.667
Go back to the house. Talk to his wife.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.674
What am I looking for exactly?

48:43.671 --> 48:45.173
Just break her.

49:00.980 --> 49:03.699
- This will never work.
- Course it will.

49:04.024 --> 49:06.903
People like that just want to be fooled.
It's their nature.

49:07.027 --> 49:09.371
Once you know that,
you can take anything you want from them.

49:10.531 --> 49:14.536
- People like what?
- The herd, John. The herd.

49:15.661 --> 49:16.708
Turn the siren on.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.505
There's a barricade.

49:25.546 --> 49:28.265
Stick your hand out the window and wave.

49:28.507 --> 49:29.554
Do it.

49:32.094 --> 49:34.893
Big grin on. Big, silly grin.

49:44.690 --> 49:48.786
Just a bunch of cowards hiding behind
an army of badges and guns.

49:50.196 --> 49:53.746
- It's not gonna work again.
- No, probably won't.

49:53.866 --> 49:56.585
We're marked men.
We can't go on hiding forever.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.622
- You ready to fight?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

49:59.747 --> 50:00.794
I told you, John.

50:00.915 --> 50:03.418
We're in this together,
whether you like it or not.

50:05.085 --> 50:07.258
This is it for me. I'm finished.

50:08.422 --> 50:11.767
Stop the car. Stop the fucking car!

50:17.097 --> 50:19.441
You think you're better than me, that it?

50:19.975 --> 50:23.320
I'm the only person
that hadn't given up on you, John.

50:23.437 --> 50:24.438
Yeah?

50:25.272 --> 50:27.445
That's why you got a gun pointed at my face?

50:27.608 --> 50:30.782
Take it from me! Be a fucking man!

50:39.453 --> 50:43.333
John, what is it you really want?

50:56.679 --> 50:59.478
Is it that hard for you to say what you want?

51:00.182 --> 51:01.434
<i>Just say it.</i>

51:03.644 --> 51:07.444
I want you to leave me alone, okay?

51:07.606 --> 51:08.823
Is that all?

51:10.818 --> 51:14.163
- I want out of this car.
- All right.

51:15.364 --> 51:17.617
- Get out.
- So you shoot me in the back?

51:17.700 --> 51:20.544
I could have killed you 100 times over today.

51:22.204 --> 51:25.174
If you want to believe the lie,
then go on living your life.

51:25.833 --> 51:28.837
The world is evil, John.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.510
It's just plain evil.

51:34.174 --> 51:35.642
That's the truth.

51:37.678 --> 51:38.975
You done?

51:42.141 --> 51:43.358
If you are.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.828
How hard was that?

52:28.729 --> 52:29.901
One more thing.

52:31.273 --> 52:33.617
Remember you invited me to your house
to meet your wife?

52:35.694 --> 52:37.571
I'll tell Joanie you said hi.

52:38.906 --> 52:40.533
How do you know my wife's name?

52:40.741 --> 52:44.416
Hope she cooks good.
I do love a good home-cooked meal.

52:45.913 --> 52:46.960
Stop!

52:52.795 --> 52:54.923
John Jr.

52:55.798 --> 52:56.924
Not now.

52:59.426 --> 53:02.430
You sure you don't want to speak in private?

53:03.972 --> 53:05.269
Is there some reason we should?

53:09.937 --> 53:12.656
You know your husband got fired today?

53:15.275 --> 53:16.777
No, I didn't.

53:18.654 --> 53:20.656
But you do know he was having an affair?

53:22.950 --> 53:24.668
I believe I said as much.

53:25.327 --> 53:28.922
You're also aware you have
a life insurance policy on him?

53:30.791 --> 53:32.793
And he's got one on me, too.

53:35.671 --> 53:36.763
Ma'am...

53:39.800 --> 53:42.144
You ever want your husband gone?

53:46.265 --> 53:47.983
Excuse Mommy for one second.

53:49.309 --> 53:53.314
You think you can walk into my home
and disrespect me and my family?

53:53.480 --> 53:55.073
I will take you down so quick,

53:55.149 --> 53:57.447
your undies will be strung
around your neck like a doily.

53:58.110 --> 54:00.613
And if you think I'm going to suddenly
burst into tears

54:00.696 --> 54:02.824
and tell you all my deepest, darkest secrets,

54:03.157 --> 54:04.500
well, then you're just lame brained enough

54:04.616 --> 54:08.086
to think that you know
anything about my family.

54:08.162 --> 54:10.335
And God knows, from looking at you,

54:10.456 --> 54:15.633
you don't have a clue
about what it means to be a good wife.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.339
You're right. I don't know.

54:19.673 --> 54:21.471
Don't placate me.

54:21.550 --> 54:26.727
I will slap that smug look off your face
before you can get your fat ass off my couch.

54:26.847 --> 54:31.853
Now, I don't know how a functionally
retarded person got a police badge,

54:32.019 --> 54:34.272
but unless you've come to arrest me,

54:34.354 --> 54:36.857
you can waddle out of here
with the rest of the birds.

54:40.986 --> 54:43.364
And make sure John gets home
safe and sound.

54:49.703 --> 54:52.377
And go ahead and grab
a Girl Scout cookie on your way out.

54:52.873 --> 54:54.216
They're fat free.

55:01.381 --> 55:02.553
Just curious,

55:04.176 --> 55:07.726
why'd you let your daughter listen
and cover your son's ears?

55:08.931 --> 55:12.936
So she knows how to defend herself,
and he remembers how to speak to a lady.

55:22.945 --> 55:24.413
Well, shit.

55:38.043 --> 55:39.090
Excuse me.

55:59.398 --> 56:00.775
Give me a hand! I need help!

56:02.442 --> 56:03.910
I need some help please!

56:05.779 --> 56:09.454
Come on, please, I need some help!
They're gonna kill my wife!

56:09.575 --> 56:11.919
Come on, I need some help!
Do you understand that?

56:12.619 --> 56:13.711
Freeze!

56:14.955 --> 56:16.753
On the ground, hurry.
Don't move, don't move.

56:28.468 --> 56:30.971
You are wasting time.

56:31.471 --> 56:32.643
How's that?

56:34.141 --> 56:37.987
This guy is gonna kill my family.
Do you get that'?

56:39.646 --> 56:41.444
- Richie?
- Yeah.

56:41.565 --> 56:44.444
The black man in a suit with a fedora?

56:44.568 --> 56:48.163
Driving an old muscle car in the suburbs
that no one else has seen?

56:48.322 --> 56:49.494
Look, sir, you don't get it.

56:49.573 --> 56:52.918
You've got to get somebody to my house
and get my family out of there!

56:54.453 --> 56:57.582
My deputy was just at your house.
Your wife doesn't want to leave.

56:57.664 --> 56:58.756
Sir...

56:59.458 --> 57:03.929
- She doesn't understand what's going on.
- Understand what?

57:04.963 --> 57:09.514
This guy, he can kill anyone. Okay?

57:13.347 --> 57:15.145
Then, why didn't he kill you?

57:15.349 --> 57:16.692
I don't know.

57:19.019 --> 57:22.694
He wants something from me, all right?
I don't know what.

57:22.773 --> 57:25.026
He was pretending like he was my friend.

57:25.609 --> 57:26.701
Pretending?

57:27.694 --> 57:31.039
Look, I'll do whatever you want, all right?

57:31.156 --> 57:34.626
Just get somebody to my house
and get my family out.

57:34.868 --> 57:36.791
- Tell the truth.
- Look, God...

57:36.870 --> 57:39.043
I've been fucking telling you the truth!

57:39.498 --> 57:41.500
I don't believe your truth.

57:41.667 --> 57:43.715
Well, then, I should talk to somebody else,

57:43.794 --> 57:45.796
'cause you don't know
what the fuck's going on.

57:45.879 --> 57:49.133
The witnesses all ID you and you alone.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.218
He was following me.

57:53.053 --> 57:55.226
Your house is being foreclosed.

57:55.889 --> 57:59.564
Bank account's empty. Savings worthless.

58:00.185 --> 58:02.654
You're past due on all your credit cards.

58:02.729 --> 58:05.903
And you got fired from your job today.
What does that sound like to you'?

58:07.067 --> 58:08.239
Bad luck?

58:09.569 --> 58:11.663
Sounds like motive to me.

58:12.572 --> 58:16.042
I put myself in your shoes and, well,

58:16.827 --> 58:18.921
can't say it makes any sense,

58:20.539 --> 58:22.917
but sometimes a man just gives up.

58:23.041 --> 58:24.759
Well, I have faith.

58:26.253 --> 58:28.255
You're an unfortunate man.

58:29.256 --> 58:32.760
Sir, do you honestly believe
that I made this all up?

58:32.926 --> 58:35.520
You think I killed all those people
because I'm in debt

58:35.595 --> 58:37.689
and I lost my fucking job?

58:37.764 --> 58:39.892
Look, just find Tammy.

58:41.101 --> 58:42.694
<i>Turn left.</i>

58:46.023 --> 58:47.024
Him.

58:47.107 --> 58:48.905
Definitely the guy.

58:50.110 --> 58:52.283
I do get paid for this, right?

58:54.114 --> 58:55.582
Straight forward.

58:58.702 --> 59:00.295
It's like they can see me there.

59:00.954 --> 59:03.252
Are you sure they can't see me?

59:07.794 --> 59:09.967
- Get him out of here.
- Yes, sir.

59:10.255 --> 59:11.802
Come on, you did great.

59:13.925 --> 59:16.144
She ripped you a new one.

59:18.096 --> 59:19.973
You knew I was gonna get it handed to me?

59:20.098 --> 59:22.942
I also knew you were gonna get something.

59:25.145 --> 59:26.488
She's having an affair.

59:27.814 --> 59:29.657
Contractor working on the house.

59:30.150 --> 59:32.994
- Building a pool.
- Pool guy'?

59:34.654 --> 59:36.827
Got him shitting bricks in the holding cell.

59:37.949 --> 59:41.670
- Anything smart come out of his mouth?
- Not a peep.

59:42.162 --> 59:44.335
It's hard to tell what he's not guilty of.

59:45.665 --> 59:48.794
Makes like a chicken. Then he clucks.

59:49.628 --> 59:50.845
Keep on plucking.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.980
You think he knew
his wife was screwing the pool guy?

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.369
Too bad.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:17.368
Looks like a nice enough guy.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:35.341
We don't see much of your type here.

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:39.019
Go figure.

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:42.223
CUP of joe?

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:47.978
Hungry?

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:57.162
- Let me get the pork chops, please.
- Sure.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.577
You want limas or fries with that?

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.159
I'd like both.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:05.078
Hope you bread those chops nice.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.257
Can I get extra gravy with that?

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:14.759
Yes, sir.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.276
You got a problem?

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.782
You see this uniform?

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:42.958
Respect the uniform.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:48.247
Or I'm gonna have to take something
from you that I can't give back.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.206
You understand?

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:53.384
You know what your partner wants?

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.299
On the house, of course.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.804
Come here, sweetheart.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.814
Come on, come closer. Come on.

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:31.335
Suspect has been shot,
suspect has been shot.

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:34.084
I repeat, please send backup
and paramedics immediately.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.436
John! Oh, my God.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.021
- Who is this?
- Tammy Strate.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.105
- Tammy?
- Yes.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:56.280
Are you okay?

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:58.029
She corroborated everything he said,
Richie and all.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.283
You, come with me.

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.623
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- It's not him.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:07.625
Everything he said, she backs it up.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.874
Doesn't mean it's true, God damn it!

01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:14.883
Local just reported three more murders,
and he said he shot and killed the perp.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.209
Positive ID?

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:20.214
"Tall, thin black man" was the description
the officer gave on the radio.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.057
Get over there now. I'll deal with this.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:39.904
What is she doing here?

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.570
I'm just trying to help.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:48.500
I think you've done enough for this family.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:52.250
We brought your wife as you requested.

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:02.676
I'm sorry.

01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:17.104
Go say hi to Daddy.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:23.114
Richie was just reported shot and killed
by an officer a few minutes ago.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:27.915
Just to be safe, there will be police officers
at your house for the next few days

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:30.417
until we complete our investigation.

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.786
What, to keep an eye on me?

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:35.460
My men will be protecting your family.

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:40.301
Maybe he was right,
what he said about you guys.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.132
What's that?

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:44.472
- Can we go home now?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.433
You guys ready?

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:01.781
Sweetheart, come here.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.328
That your doggie?

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:10.832
Show him to me.

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:14.994
Come closer.

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:19.336
Closer.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.467
He a good dog?

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:27.514
He bites.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.512
That's as good <i>as</i> anything, I guess.

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:10.509
They dump you out here all night, too?

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:14.062
No, no, I gotta go in and talk to the old bag.

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:45.259
You kids done?

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.676
Just stop, I'm gonna get you.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.600
Come on. Why don't you guys go up?
Come on.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.227
I'll come tuck you in.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.283
Is everything okay?

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.036
You must be Joanie.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:25.293
Yes, come in. You're getting wet.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.126
And who is that?

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:31.048
These are our two children.
This is Sam, and this is John Jr.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.382
Say hello to the nice officer.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.718
- Boy's name for a girl?
- Yes.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.313
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:44.902
Okay.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:49.573
Come in.

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:08.919
Where's the local cop that called it in?

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:11.512
This guy's a real cop.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.140
- How do you know?
- Come on.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.135
It's not Richie.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.515
Police Academy, class of 1968.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.443
Lieutenant.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.866
Our guys in front of the house
are not picking up.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:42.161
Scotch on the rocks,
that's what John drinks, too. Here you go.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:49.379
Guys, let's go. Bed. Come on.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:53.671
Hey, your dad's a hero. How about that?

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.348
Again?

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.473
I didn't know you boys could drink on duty.

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:06.567
I won't tell if you don't.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:25.916
You cooking something? Smells good.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.880
Pork chops.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.419
They're John's favourite.
I thought he might need a good meal.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:40.260
John explain what happened?

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:44.555
No, no, but it's, you know,
it's been all over the news, so...

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:47.267
Hey, maybe you can sell the story
to the papers.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.444
You know, people love a good tale like that.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:56.277
I would hate to profit
off of somebody else's tragedy, so...

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.622
That's why I'm here, actually.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:16.804
You're making me nervous, Officer...

01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:18.635
Stevens.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:28.479
I should go check on the oven real quick.
Would you excuse me'?

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.564
I'll be right back.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.037
- Jesus Christ.
- What's wrong?

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:11.410
What is it?

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:19.715
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:36.523
Get up there and check on them right now.
Get up there, do it!

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.940
What are you worried about, John?
I was just up there with them.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.617
- Joanie!
- I tucked them in myself.

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:48.285
Little angels, and you got two of them.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:51.622
You are so lucky.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:58.041
- They're okay.
- Stay there.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:07.217
Just so you know, the police are out there.
Do you understand that'?

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.644
You still underestimate me
after all we've been through.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.981
Well, that's just plain dumb.

01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:19.108
Question for you, John, is do you hate me
more than you love your family?

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.240
In the time it takes you
to go outside and get help,

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.817
I could destroy your whole family.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.164
Listen, what is it that you want from us?

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:38.673
You invited me over for dinner,
to meet your wife. I'm here.

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:43.678
Now, treat me like a guest.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:49.016
You know
I'm not going to let you harm them.

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:51.102
You know that?

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:52.645
So, you're gonna have to kill me.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:56.190
I told you, I don't make deals. I don't have to.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.689
I'm giving you a choice, John.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.438
That's more than I'm giving anyone else,

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.773
including your wife and kids.

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:09.612
- I told you to stay upstairs.
- What the hell is going on?

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:12.873
How about those pork chops, Joanie?
I'm starving.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.122
I'm afraid I don't care for your tone.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.003
Makes two of us.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:22.049
Get out of my house. Now.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:23.714
John?

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:28.556
Tell this person to get out of our house
and leave us alone, now.

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:32.014
John.

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:35.058
He's our guest, right?

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:37.731
Our guest.

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:40.647
We're gonna treat you that way.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:42.819
Okay?

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:50.160
Again?

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.200
Help him.

01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:16.721
Doesn't John do most of the cooking
around here?

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:19.603
- He likes to cook.
- Good thing, too,

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:23.103
'cause this is cooked badly.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:28.403
Poorly. It's cooked poorly.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:41.120
Could you sharpen this for me?
It's kind of dull.

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:44.089
- The knife's sharp enough.
- Not mine.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.816
You remember the first time
you saw me today, John?

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:08.739
- At the front door?
- No. In your rear view mirror.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.738
When I blasted by, you were sitting in
the driveway twiddling your thumbs,

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.740
thinking about your meaningless life.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:15.821
You were talking to that guy who worked...

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.166
The guy who works on your house?

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.585
How do you think I know that?

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:25.836
'Cause you've been following me.

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:30.003
But why? Why would I follow you, John?

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:33.260
Come on. Put it together, John.

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:37.431
Put it together.
Why did I knock on your door today?

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:38.602
Perfect timing.

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:41.772
Joanie, get upstairs,
get the kids and get out of here!

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:46.318
Or better yet, sit down
and listen to what I have to say.

01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:53.861
Now, John,
why did I knock on your door today?

01:16:58.781 --> 01:16:59.873
Joanie, you want to tell him?

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.457
Why I knocked on your door today?

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:08.792
Or why the back door was left wide open?

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:12.219
Or why you took the kids
and left when he got home?

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:15.840
What is he talking about, John?

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.888
You both make me sick.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:28.483
Sitting here like I'm the bad guy,
like I did something wrong.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:37.070
- Tell him why, bitch!
- I have never seen you in my life!

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:39.913
Yeah, that's true.
You did send someone else to meet me.

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:48.339
- What's he talking about?
- I have no idea.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:51.418
She does not love you, John.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.381
She's a liar.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:59.425
She's fucking someone else,
and she wants you dead!

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:02.266
- He's lying.
- She hired me to kill you.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.603
I was supposed to drive you out in the sticks,
throw your body in a ditch...

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.025
- Oh, my God.
- ...but I didn't.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.444
Because I saw something in your eyes, John.

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:13.026
John, you can't believe this man.
You can't believe him.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:14.948
She doesn't have the guts to kill you herself.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:17.033
- He's lying, you can't believe...
- I am no liar!

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:19.703
- I have no idea what he's talking about.
- John, you can vouch for me there.

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:20.779
No. You are lying!

01:18:20.905 --> 01:18:24.125
I tell it the way I see it,
and I see it the way it is!

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:26.126
John, I love you.

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:27.871
That's right, kill her, John.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:30.627
- John, I love you.
- Rip her fucking throat out!

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:39.716
Now, you got the instinct, just like me.

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:40.970
- Please don't do...
- Shut up!

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.394
Remember, she's cold-blooded.
Don't listen to her.

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:45.892
Don't listen to that bitch! Kill her!

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.223
- Kill that bitch!
- I love you!

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:59.490
Wait! Wait, stop! I'm not going to hurt you.

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:00.653
Just give it to me.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:03.406
Give it to me.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.662
Come here, you motherfucker!

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.993
- Put it...
- You motherfucker!

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:12.168
Get out of here! Go!

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:02.639
Careful.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.347
Jesus!

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:06.970
They're out back!

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:09.062
Watch my children.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:31.428
Mr. Felton.

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:34.936
We're gonna take your wife in
for more questioning.

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:39.653
On what evidence?

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:42.569
Your testimony, for starters.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:45.275
Look...

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:51.616
I just told you what he said.
I didn't say I believed it.

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:55.665
What other explanation can you have?

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.966
She's my wife.

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:45.011
- What does he think he's doing?
- Something I never could.

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:51.391
Nice shot.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.812
You know, smoking kills sperm cells.

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:02.478
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:05.363
Let's go get fat.

01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:11.802
Everything's going to be okay, isn't it, John?

01:24:12.305 --> 01:24:18.176
