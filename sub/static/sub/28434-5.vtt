WEBVTT

00:08.520 --> 00:12.320
- And...ta-da! Congratulations!

00:12.320 --> 00:15.080
- On what? 
- Well, all the doors are now shut,

00:15.080 --> 00:17.400
and I just sealed the last window.
So you know what that means?

00:17.400 --> 00:19.000
- We should get a carbon monoxide
alarm?

00:19.000 --> 00:23.240
- No! Well, yes. But it also means
that pigeon can't get in here.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.960
Which I'd say calls for a toast.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.240
- I thought we were saving that to
celebrate the woodworm treatment.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.320
- Nah, it's only prosecco. I'll buy
another bottle.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.720
- CORK RICOCHETS 
- Oh!

00:34.560 --> 00:36.400
- See, this is why we wait for the
woodworm treatment.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.760
- Quick! Block the hole before the
pigeon gets...

00:38.760 --> 00:40.360
- COOING

00:41.520 --> 00:43.280
Hmm... 
- How?!

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:10.240 --> 01:12.560
- Mike, it won't shut with that on. 
- Yeah, I'm not an idiot.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.680
They're just holding it while I put
the Sellotape on.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.120
- BARKING

01:17.160 --> 01:18.440
- Bitches!

01:18.440 --> 01:21.520
Bitches! Bitches!

01:21.520 --> 01:22.560
Bitches!

01:22.560 --> 01:24.560
They don't listen.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.840
Women, eh?

01:25.840 --> 01:27.800
- BOTH: 
- Um... 
- Barclay!

01:27.800 --> 01:29.440
- Er... 
- Beg-Chetwynde.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.720
- Wh...What's that?

01:30.720 --> 01:32.600
- That's me. Barclay Beg-Chetwynde.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.040
- Oh! 
- From next door.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.600
- Oh! 
- We have a next door?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.240
- Yes, about a mile that way.

01:37.240 --> 01:40.240
I own the... You know the village? 
- BOTH: 
- Yeah.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.760
- Yes, I own that.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.320
We summer in Tuscany, but got back
and saw you'd moved in.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.400
Thought I should come say how do?

01:47.400 --> 01:51.240
- Right. Yeah. I'm...I'm Alison, and
this is Mike. Sorry - come in.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.320
- Thank you.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.000
- DOG BARKING

01:55.000 --> 01:56.720
BARKING BACK

01:56.720 --> 01:58.000
- What you say?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.080
- Tally! Tally!

02:00.080 --> 02:01.960
Must have seen a ghost.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.320
Ah!

02:03.320 --> 02:07.160
Didn't you know? This place -
absolutely riddled with them.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.800
So legend has it. There's a lady
falls from a window

02:10.800 --> 02:12.640
in the west wing. 
- East wing!

02:12.640 --> 02:14.280
- Dressed in white. 
- Grey!

02:14.280 --> 02:15.680
- Georgian. 
- Edwardian.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.560
- Attractive. Early 20s.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.120
And a strange creature that roams
the grounds -

02:23.120 --> 02:25.320
half man, half ape.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.760
- Huh?

02:28.760 --> 02:31.960
- Oh! Well, I haven't seen anything. 
- No.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.480
No, he hasn't. 
- It's probably all tosh and piffle.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.200
Anyway, reason I called, incepto ne
desistam...

02:38.200 --> 02:40.800
- Oh, I remember this berk!

02:40.800 --> 02:43.440
Met him at a party fundraiser here
back in the day.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.240
Rich as Croesus. Loves the sound of
his own voice.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.760
Which reminds me of a very funny
story

02:48.760 --> 02:50.240
I heard once on a golf course.

02:50.240 --> 02:52.440
Now, there was Brucie. That's Brucie
Forsyth...

02:52.440 --> 02:54.120
Guys! Guys, anecdote!

02:54.120 --> 02:56.200
Anecdote alert, right in the middle
of one.

02:56.200 --> 03:01.040
- Now, it doesn't really affect your
grounds inside the gates,

03:01.040 --> 03:05.400
but the path outside the gates is on
my deed,

03:05.400 --> 03:09.520
so, technically, you have to cross a
strip of my land

03:09.520 --> 03:12.400
every time you enter your house.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
- Oh. We had no idea.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.320
- It's a simple thing to sort out,

03:16.320 --> 03:20.680
but probably worth a quick powwow at
some point.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.760
- Yeah, sure. Well, we'll... 
- Maybe you could come to dinner
some time?

03:23.760 --> 03:25.840
- Splendid idea! See you at eight.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.280
- I'm free! 
- Er...

03:28.280 --> 03:30.920
- I'll bring a Pelaverga!

03:30.920 --> 03:35.320
- What's a...? 
- Oh, and Bunny can't eat beef.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.480
Well, she can, but she shouldn't, if
you know what I mean.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.440
- AWKWARD LAUGHTER

03:40.440 --> 03:43.520
- Right, once more unto the breach!
Come along, bitches!

03:45.480 --> 03:47.240
- Is that all of them?

03:47.240 --> 03:49.760
Never mind. What did you do that
for?

03:49.760 --> 03:52.160
- Because he's got some weird claim
over our driveway,

03:52.160 --> 03:54.040
so we should probably keep him
sweet.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.840
Besides, he's our way in.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.000
- To what?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.240
- Society, Mike. We're posh now.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.760
We should be mixing with other
poshos.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.840
- But he is awful! 
- So?

04:02.840 --> 04:05.000
Some awful people have really nice
friends.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.840
I mean, look at your mate Greg.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.120
- What's wrong with Greg?

04:08.120 --> 04:10.120
- Nothing.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.360
- Hello, girl! You're lovely, in't
you?

04:13.360 --> 04:14.920
- BARKING 
- Oh...

04:14.920 --> 04:16.320
It's worth it.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.160
Ah! Hello, girl!

04:18.160 --> 04:20.800
Yeah! 
- Ohh...

04:20.800 --> 04:22.120
BARKING

04:22.120 --> 04:24.200
- I can't touch any more.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.960
- HOWLING

04:37.160 --> 04:39.720
HOWLING

04:39.720 --> 04:41.640
HE SNIFFS

04:44.800 --> 04:47.640
HE GRUNTS

04:47.640 --> 04:49.560
- Um...book? Film?

04:50.800 --> 04:53.160
Five words. The Importance Of Being
Earnest.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.440
Great Expectations.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.680
Tootsie! Tootsie!

04:55.680 --> 04:57.480
Tootsie! Tootsie! Tootsie!

04:57.480 --> 04:59.720
It's Tootsie. Tootsie! It's Tootsie!

04:59.720 --> 05:01.280
Tootsie! Tootsie!

05:01.280 --> 05:02.680
- Stop saying Tootsie!

05:02.680 --> 05:04.480
- What be a tootsie?

05:04.480 --> 05:05.800
- PAT: 
- Round...

05:05.800 --> 05:07.320
...er, covering...

05:07.320 --> 05:10.640
Oh, it's an eclipse! 
- Ah! Eclipse.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.000
Moonah eclipse! 
- God, not this again.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.080
- Must we humour this bull calf? 
- It's absolutely asinine.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.880
- It is a wonderful group activity,
and he doesn't ask for much.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.440
- Well, he can't ask for much.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.400
- Hey! Me speak good!

05:23.400 --> 05:26.120
- Well! Me speak well! I!

05:26.120 --> 05:28.800
- I'm not actually free tonight, but
I could do Thursday.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.520
- No. Eclipse is tonight!

05:30.520 --> 05:32.000
- All right, all right, all right!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.280
We'll do it, provided I can do the
reading.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.080
- Not a chance, sir!

05:36.080 --> 05:37.520
Me always do the reading!

05:37.520 --> 05:39.160
I... 
- Very well.

05:39.160 --> 05:40.720
We'll put it to the vote.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.120
Who would you like to hear speak
more - me or Thomas?

05:47.200 --> 05:49.440
- Be there a third option?

05:53.160 --> 05:54.920
- Yeah, that is pretty much what I
thought.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.200
Torn thing of peas and a frozen
lasagne.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.800
- Ooh! Make your lasagne!

05:58.800 --> 06:00.600
- Mike, my lasagne IS frozen
lasagne.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.600
I'm not serving them that. I don't
want them thinking

06:02.600 --> 06:04.360
that we're the sort of that people
that we are.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.120
- Well, what do posh people eat?

06:06.120 --> 06:08.000
- Turtle soup. 
- No.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.560
- What? 
- Turtle soup.

06:09.560 --> 06:10.840
- Oh, yeah. No.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.480
- Oyster rissoles? 
- Oyster rissoles?

06:13.480 --> 06:16.240
- You don't like shellfish, and I'm
not eating anything's rissole.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.040
- I don't think it means what you
think it means.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.920
- What about pheasant? 
- Oh...

06:20.920 --> 06:22.720
- What?

06:22.720 --> 06:24.640
- Up a bit. Left a bit.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.000
- Can't we just go to the shops?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.640
- No, we haven't got time. Just
concentrate.

06:27.640 --> 06:30.200
Down a bit. A bit more.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.800
Bit more.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.840
Bit more...

06:32.840 --> 06:35.560
- Do you want to do it? 
- You lost the toss.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.680
- Little bit more. 
- Bit more.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.280
- I don't think I can do... 
- Fire, fire, fire! 
- Go! 
- Argh!

06:41.280 --> 06:44.840
- Ha-ha! Gleaming bundook op from
the civvy!

06:44.840 --> 06:47.560
We'll have him out boshing Jerry in
no time!

06:47.560 --> 06:49.440
- What did he say? 
- No idea.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.720
And then something racist.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.360
- There's a hare. There's a hare!
There's a hare!

06:54.360 --> 06:56.800
- He says, there's a hare. 
- There's a hare. Pom-pom!

06:56.800 --> 07:00.000
- This is grim. Why did I have to
pluck it?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.480
- HE RETCHES

07:04.520 --> 07:06.600
In the oven for 20 minutes.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.160
- No, you have to de-gloves the
gizzards.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.960
- Well, it doesn't say that here
and, no offence, Mary,

07:11.960 --> 07:14.800
but I trust the book more than
you... Oh, my God.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.880
- Gizzards. 
- Oh...

07:16.880 --> 07:18.280
HE RETCHES

07:20.120 --> 07:22.720
Right, you're in charge of the
pheasant.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.400
Call me when it looks done.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.760
- Done. 
- OK, I'm going to change into...

07:28.760 --> 07:30.160
What do posh people wear?

07:30.160 --> 07:32.400
- Crowns? 
- I'm asking the wrong person.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.360
- Oh, yes, yeah.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.120
- Oof! That smells gamey.

07:38.800 --> 07:42.040
STRAINING

07:42.040 --> 07:43.200
- Left a bit...

07:43.200 --> 07:45.000
No, right a bit.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.480
No, left a bit...

07:46.480 --> 07:48.040
- It's fine!

07:48.040 --> 07:49.520
- It's amazing, isn't it,

07:49.520 --> 07:52.680
to think, a sacred site right here
for all those years?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.000
Your own little Stonehenge.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.880
- No! Stonehenge copied!

07:56.880 --> 07:58.840
- OK. All right, all right. 
- Well!

07:58.840 --> 08:01.320
- Settle down. Now, the eclipse
itself will be at...

08:01.320 --> 08:02.840
- Dong-dong-dong...

08:02.840 --> 08:05.080
- Robin! 
- ...dong-dong-dong... 
- Robin!

08:05.080 --> 08:07.440
Yes, thank you, Robin!

08:07.440 --> 08:09.000
We got it the first time.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.160
It'll be at 2100.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.560
Nine o'clock.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.400
Now, I trust everyone remembers the
drill?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.240
I, of course, will be doing the
reading...

08:16.240 --> 08:18.240
- Farcical. It should be I... Me!

08:18.240 --> 08:21.280
- ..based on Robin's recollection of
the original ritual.

08:21.280 --> 08:26.680
- Er, thank be to moonah! Good light
in sky...

08:26.680 --> 08:28.560
- Loosely based. Any questions?

08:28.560 --> 08:29.720
Excellent.

08:29.720 --> 08:34.600
And, as always, our muster point
will be right...here.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.880
- Moonah stone!

08:42.480 --> 08:47.800
- No, you heathen! Spoon on the
outside, spoon on the outside!

08:47.800 --> 08:49.280
Oh, I can't look.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.120
- BOTH: 
- Is that what you're wearing? Me?!

08:53.120 --> 08:54.640
- You look like Downton Abbey.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.080
- Abbey's not a character, Mike.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.880
And, for your information, this is
entirely appropriate evening attire

08:59.880 --> 09:02.920
for entertaining guests of such
refined social standing.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.640
BOTH: 
- The Beg-Chetwyndes are de-facto
gatekeepers

09:05.640 --> 09:09.120
for the county's social calendar,
and are possessing of a very fine...

09:09.120 --> 09:10.400
- I know what you're doing.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.720
- Fine.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.000
But I am reliably informed that this
is how posh people dress,

09:15.000 --> 09:16.720
so I'm sorry, but I'm not changing
anything.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.280
- I'll put on a shirt if you lose
the pearls.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.360
- Yep, OK.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.440
DOORBELL Ooh!

09:21.440 --> 09:24.000
- Argh! 
- Hurry up!

09:24.000 --> 09:25.760
- They're here, they're here! How do
I look?

09:25.760 --> 09:27.200
- The same, Kitty.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.960
- And remember, don't... Just don't.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.240
This is important to us.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.880
- Ah! Annabel!

09:33.880 --> 09:36.560
- Alison. 
- This is Bunny. Bunny, this is
Annabel.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.640
- Alison. 
- Sorry we're early, I drove here.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.000
- Oh, yeah.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.560
- Michael, Bunny!

09:42.560 --> 09:44.440
Bunny, Michael.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.840
Smashing shirt. Who is it?

09:46.840 --> 09:48.320
- It's me?

09:48.320 --> 09:51.120
- And I'm Kitty! I'm wearing what I
died in.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.720
- Splendid to welcome you.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.640
Please do come in on...on in
through.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.680
- Super! 
- Bunny's been so looking forward to
meeting you.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.000
- Have I? Ooh!

10:00.640 --> 10:03.600
- Et voila! Pelaverga!

10:03.600 --> 10:06.240
- Oh! 
- Let me see! Let me see it!

10:06.240 --> 10:08.120
Let me see! 
- Thank you. That is most kind.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.720
Ooh!

10:09.720 --> 10:11.440
SHE GASPS

10:11.440 --> 10:12.600
Oh...

10:12.600 --> 10:14.880
- I am so sorry.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.840
My wife recently had a head injury,

10:16.840 --> 10:19.960
which has caused some of her
behaviour to be a little...

10:19.960 --> 10:22.160
- PIGEON COOS

10:22.160 --> 10:24.400
Mike, why don't you pop down to the
cellar

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400
and try and find us another bottle
of wine?

10:26.400 --> 10:29.160
- Er, yeah... 
- And I can show our guests through.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.760
Do come in on.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.080
The building work is still under
way,

10:33.080 --> 10:34.960
so you may have to adjust your... 
- Bra strap!

10:34.960 --> 10:36.400
- ..bra strap. Expectations!

10:43.440 --> 10:46.680
So, indeed, they advised myself

10:46.680 --> 10:50.160
to just sell the house without even
seeing it, but I said...

10:50.160 --> 10:52.040
- Don't speak with your mouth full!

11:06.440 --> 11:08.080
- ...but I said that...

11:09.480 --> 11:10.640
Sorry, it's gone.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.960
- So, yeah, the idea is to turn it
into a hotel.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.800
- An 'otel, eh? Mmm.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.960
Could be a nice little earner.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.640
- Well, it will not be easy, but... 
- Elbows!

11:20.640 --> 11:22.760
- ..I think we're on top of things.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.160
SMOKE ALARM BLARES

11:24.160 --> 11:25.440
- # Me, me, me! #

11:25.440 --> 11:27.360
What's louder, me or that?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.960
# Me, me, me! #

11:29.960 --> 11:33.960
- Sorry, I just need to go and have
a word with my...myself.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.840
- # Me... # 
- Ssh!

11:37.840 --> 11:39.400
BEEPING CONTINUES

11:40.840 --> 11:42.280
- Who's had that?

11:42.280 --> 11:45.440
- COUGHING Mary! Didn't you smell
burning?

11:45.440 --> 11:48.640
- I always smells burning.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.240
- BEEPING STOPS

11:51.240 --> 11:52.800
SIZZLING

11:57.160 --> 11:58.720
Would you eat that?

11:58.720 --> 12:01.880
- Well, I hasn't eaten in 400 years,

12:01.880 --> 12:03.320
but no.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.680
- Ah!

12:04.680 --> 12:06.280
Maybe I can salvage it?

12:06.280 --> 12:09.680
- That's burnt. And I'd know. 
- Right.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.360
Ooh...ah!

12:11.360 --> 12:12.720
Where's the, um...? Ah!

12:12.720 --> 12:15.120
Voila! Pheasant stew.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.720
Right, you watch this. I've got to
get back up there

12:17.720 --> 12:20.760
and convince them I haven't lost my
marbles. 
- What are marbles?

12:20.760 --> 12:23.120
- Just call me when it's reduced. 
- Right.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.720
Reduced to what?

12:26.720 --> 12:28.560
- HOWLING

12:31.480 --> 12:32.880
Sorry about that.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.680
Er, cremated the pheasant.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.720
But all sorted now!

12:36.720 --> 12:40.120
So, um, let's just pretend that this
evening so far never happened,

12:40.120 --> 12:41.720
and start right...

12:41.720 --> 12:43.440
WOLFLIKE HOWLING

12:44.640 --> 12:46.800
CHANTING: 
- Moonah-stona! Moonah-stona!

12:46.800 --> 12:49.920
Moonah-stona! Moonah-stona!

12:49.920 --> 12:52.600
- SLURRED: 
- So, Alison...

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
- Annabel. 
- Annabel.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.080
- Moonah-stona! Moonah-stona!

12:56.080 --> 12:59.320
- And now thanks be to the wondrous
moon

12:59.320 --> 13:03.560
and the guiding light it giveth
between 2100 hours...

13:03.560 --> 13:04.960
- Dramatic pause.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.280
Take a breath! Give it some light
and shade!

13:08.280 --> 13:12.760
Oh, blessed moon as spied from the
Earth

13:12.760 --> 13:14.800
Bright as thine eyes

13:14.800 --> 13:17.600
Round as thine eyes

13:17.600 --> 13:19.440
Yet too far apart, like thine...

13:19.440 --> 13:21.800
No, I don't mean your eyes, I
mean...

13:21.800 --> 13:23.400
- Thorne! I'm doing the reading.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.920
I won the vote! 
- To be fair, it was very close and
entirely non-binding.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.800
- SLURRED: 
- ..wouldn't you say?

13:29.960 --> 13:32.560
- OWL HOOTS Mm!

13:32.560 --> 13:35.360
- Moonah-stona! Moonah-stona! 
- Yes, I wouldn't.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.360
CHANTING Or would I?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.600
CHANTING

13:45.000 --> 13:48.320
CHANTING

13:48.320 --> 13:49.880
I...I was saying to Mike...

13:49.880 --> 13:51.520
YELLING: ..just this morning...

13:51.520 --> 13:55.560
..it's been unseasonably warm for
the time of year! Bread?

13:55.560 --> 13:56.600
- No, thank you.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.200
- CHANTING

13:58.200 --> 14:00.680
- A lady does not raise her voice in
polite company.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.880
- ELECTRICITY FIZZES

14:05.880 --> 14:07.320
ALISON LAUGHS

14:07.320 --> 14:08.960
- Stew update!

14:08.960 --> 14:11.120
All the water's turned to clouds.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.480
- SHE SIGHS

14:12.480 --> 14:13.920
CHANTING

14:15.560 --> 14:16.920
- Is it a bad time?

14:16.920 --> 14:18.440
- Mike!

14:18.440 --> 14:20.680
Bit of a problem with the old...

14:20.680 --> 14:24.800
..electrics again. Maybe you should
show our guests THE FUSE BOX.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.680
- Um, yeah.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.440
- The fuse box!

14:28.440 --> 14:31.000
- Right, fuse box. Yeah. This way,
then, guys.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.360
- Oh, yeah.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.000
- CHANTING

14:39.000 --> 14:40.080
Right!

14:40.080 --> 14:41.960
KITTY SINGING

14:41.960 --> 14:43.400
- I'll come back.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.840
- Now, you listen to me! I don't
know what's going on here, but...
Kitty!

14:46.840 --> 14:48.680
STOPS SINGING

14:48.680 --> 14:51.960
But it stops right now, because I'm
having a dinner party,

14:51.960 --> 14:54.440
which should be clear from the fact
that I'm having a dinner party!

14:54.440 --> 14:56.560
- But this moonah eclipse very
special.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.160
- I don't care what it is!

14:58.160 --> 14:59.800
It stops right now.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.560
- Now, hang on a moment.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.280
This is a time-honoured ritual that
means a great deal to Robin

15:05.280 --> 15:07.560
and, frankly, I think he deserves a
little respect.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.000
- Yes. Moonah is...

15:09.000 --> 15:10.200
- Shut up, Robin!

15:10.200 --> 15:12.040
The point is, we were here first,

15:12.040 --> 15:14.760
so maybe you lot should take your
leave.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.880
- No.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.640
This is my house now and I'm not
going anywhere.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.280
- Well, neither are we.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.640
- Quite right!

15:23.760 --> 15:24.800
- WHISPERS: 
- Sorry.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.800
- Wait there.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.280
- Right. Stand firm, everybody.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.200
I don't know what she has in her
arsenal,

15:33.200 --> 15:34.400
but we shall remain resolute

15:34.400 --> 15:36.440
against the tyranny that is... 
- SHE GASPS

15:39.040 --> 15:40.480
- Ooh!

15:40.480 --> 15:42.560
- What in the name of St Cuthbert?

15:42.560 --> 15:45.040
- It's all the colours at once!

15:45.040 --> 15:46.880
- But what does it do?

15:46.880 --> 15:49.040
- I'm so glad you asked.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.280
Come this way.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.720
- But, no, wait...

15:53.720 --> 15:56.560
- It's a compact disc. 
- Guys!

15:56.560 --> 15:58.280
But it's moonah!

16:04.800 --> 16:07.680
- And last but not least, we have
this one,

16:07.680 --> 16:10.560
which is "west wing socks." 
- Sockets.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.720
- Ah. Yeah. That makes more sense.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.680
And I think that is all the fuses I
can show you.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.600
- Fascinating. 
- Yeah.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.800
To be honest, there's not really
anything that fabulous down here.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.520
- Speak for yourself.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.960
- Ooh. Plonk!

16:26.960 --> 16:30.000
- Oh! Clearly a connoisseur. 
- I'll grab another bottle.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.320
- Actually, while we've got a
moment,

16:32.320 --> 16:35.800
perhaps we could just discuss the
whole access issue?

16:35.800 --> 16:37.240
- I don't... 
- Splendid!

16:37.240 --> 16:41.000
Now, the former owner and I just had
a gentleman's agreement,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.680
but if you're going to run this
place as a business,

16:43.680 --> 16:47.320
you probably want something a bit
more official in place,

16:47.320 --> 16:48.760
financially speaking.

16:48.760 --> 16:53.760
- Um... 
- So, what if I were to sign over
access rights to you for...

16:53.760 --> 16:55.680
Oh, what shall we say?

16:55.680 --> 16:57.840
Oh, I don't know. 20?

16:57.840 --> 16:59.360
- 20?

16:59.360 --> 17:00.960
Oh, 20's fine!

17:00.960 --> 17:02.880
- Wonderful.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.960
And since we're all friends now,

17:04.960 --> 17:08.040
let's call it 19,500.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.440
- GLASS SMASHES

17:09.440 --> 17:10.880
- Sorry!

17:10.880 --> 17:12.640
- Less 30 quid for that.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.160
- HE CHUCKLES

17:15.760 --> 17:18.680
- Wow! Look at the quality!

17:18.680 --> 17:20.680
Knocks the socks off of Betamax.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.640
- It's called Friends. It's a
comedy.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.040
- Like Vanity Fair.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.720
- No, that's a magazine. And this is
a box set. So,

17:26.720 --> 17:28.160
plenty more where that came from.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.600
Have fun, don't leave the room
and...

17:30.600 --> 17:32.280
Don't leave the room.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.960
- It just appears to be five people
sitting around on a sofa.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.480
What's so amusing about...? Hello!

17:41.480 --> 17:43.120
Who is this?

17:44.960 --> 17:47.200
- Ah, Annabel! 
- Sorry, sorry, won't be a moment.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.800
- No hurry.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.760
- OK. Slight problem. 
- Oh? And it was going so well.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.520
- Yeah. So you know the whole access
thing?

17:53.520 --> 17:56.480
Barclay said that we could have the
rights for 20 grand.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.320
- Ha! Yeah! Dream on, mate.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.960
- Yeah. I know, right? The thing is,
I think I shook on it.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.480
- Huh, what? 
- Well, he held his hand out.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.280
What was I supposed to do? Not shake
it?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.920
- Yes! 
- I can't do that. It's too awkward.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.040
If someone puts their hand out, I
always shake it.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.920
- Can this evening get any worse?

18:11.920 --> 18:16.920
- Right. Stew news! I believes it
has reduced.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.080
- SIZZLING

18:19.080 --> 18:21.280
That is beyond reduced.

18:21.280 --> 18:25.200
- Yeah, I've got to be honest, I
don't know what "reduced" means.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.720
- Yeah.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.000
- Well, that was wonderful.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.880
- Yes! 
- However do you get it so square?

18:35.880 --> 18:38.360
- Secret, I'm afraid. Old family
recipe.

18:38.360 --> 18:41.640
- Another! 
- No, come on, Buns, you've had
enough.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.360
Right, then, port and poker!

18:44.360 --> 18:45.840
Money on the table.

18:45.840 --> 18:49.240
- Actually, talking of money...
About the access thing...

18:49.240 --> 18:52.520
- Oh, that's all sorted. Worked
something out with your fella here.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.960
- Oh, come on.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.600
- Wow. 
- Good lad.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.360
Right, am I dealing everyone in?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.400
- Yep! 
- I'm afraid we don't play.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.960
- I play. I'm a player.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.720
- I'm not sure you are, Mike.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.440
- I am a player.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.440
- OK.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.640
Right, well, I guess I'm getting the
port, then.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.680
- Deal.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.160
- There we go. That's yours...

19:25.520 --> 19:26.880
Oh, dear.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.640
- I've lost 100 quid.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.920
- Beginner's luck, I assure you.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.280
Another hand?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.920
- MUSIC AND LAUGHTER

19:42.920 --> 19:45.080
- She is beguiling, the Lady Rachel.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.040
Is it her hair? Perhaps it's her
hair.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.680
There's something about her hair.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.720
- I'm Phoebe. And Lady Button's
Monica.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.240
- ALL AGREE 
- And the Captain's Ross.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.640
- What? No! I'm clearly Chandler.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.160
It's a dry wit, but it's there.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.520
- I'm sorry, did we zip our lips? I
think we zipped our lips.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.640
- Oh.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.720
- # There'll be a light

20:18.720 --> 20:22.200
# In the dark... #

20:22.200 --> 20:25.440
- Robin! We're watching Friends
here, mate!

20:25.440 --> 20:27.680
- Right, I need your help.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.600
GHOSTS: 
- Shh! 
- No, no, no. It's important.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.720
- As is this! My empathy's hewn
betwixt lovelorn Ross

20:33.720 --> 20:36.160
and Joey, the Veronan lothario.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.360
- No, you don't understand... 
- No, young lady,

20:38.360 --> 20:39.760
you do not understand!

20:39.760 --> 20:41.880
You cannot banish us with one
breath,

20:41.880 --> 20:44.240
and then demand our reinforcement
with the next.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.280
- No moonah stone, no help lady!

20:46.280 --> 20:48.880
- Oh, come on. Surely one of you
will...? 
- Alison!

20:48.880 --> 20:53.760
Just to check, can I stops watching
the pot now?

20:55.080 --> 20:59.960
I can't play gambles. 
- No, no, you don't need to.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.280
Just look at his cards and tell me
what you see.

21:02.280 --> 21:03.920
- Oh... 
- Yeah?

21:03.920 --> 21:05.760
SNORING

21:07.080 --> 21:09.320
Sorry. Needed a wee.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.440
- Better out than in. I've dealt you
a hand.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.280
- Great. Great, great, great.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.360
Hmm.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.280
In fact, why don't we make this
interesting?

21:19.280 --> 21:20.680
Double or nothing.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.960
If you win the game, then we you pay
double what you wanted

21:23.960 --> 21:26.240
for access to our drive. 
- What?

21:26.240 --> 21:27.680
- 40,000?

21:27.680 --> 21:30.240
And if I lose?

21:30.240 --> 21:32.560
- You sign it over for free.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.320
- You're trying to bluff me!

21:36.320 --> 21:38.760
Nice try, but nothing gets past me,
Annabel.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.320
You're on!

21:40.320 --> 21:42.720
- Are you insane?

21:42.720 --> 21:43.960
Argh!

21:48.920 --> 21:50.480
- Right.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.000
OK. 
- CLEARS THROAT

21:52.000 --> 21:53.280
- Yeah.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.760
There's a person whose blanket is
also a person,

21:56.760 --> 22:01.480
but it's upside down and be like
they've had a quarrel.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.200
There's a number more than three

22:04.200 --> 22:07.280
but with a shape that's like a loaf,

22:07.280 --> 22:10.640
but it's on its side, on the end of
a wrong stick.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.520
- Just pop a cheque in the post.

22:15.520 --> 22:18.080
Or a banker's draft - whatever's
easier.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.120
- Was I wearing shoes?

22:21.200 --> 22:24.200
- Honestly. Can't take her anywhere.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.880
Come on! Silly moo.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.120
- Ah, there you are.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.880
Now, it's saying to load the next
disc into the...

22:31.880 --> 22:34.240
- We need disc two. 
- Yes. 
- Where's disc two?

22:34.240 --> 22:37.880
- Forget it, OK? Thanks to you, we
just lost Â£40,000!

22:37.880 --> 22:40.160
- What? 
- Yeah! 
- What did we do?

22:40.160 --> 22:42.400
- Nothing. That's the whole point!

22:42.400 --> 22:44.480
- 40 grand? To that gasbag?

22:44.480 --> 22:47.200
What did you do, play him at poker?

22:47.200 --> 22:49.440
- HE CHUCKLES 
- Oh, she did!

22:49.440 --> 22:51.880
- Sorry, just to clarify, that was a
firm answer on disc two?

22:52.880 --> 22:56.560
- Word of advice - never play
someone who can afford to lose.

22:56.560 --> 22:59.800
Not as if he needs the money either.
Unless it's for legal fees.

22:59.800 --> 23:03.920
Maybe they've finally found out
about that bank account in Fiji.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.080
- Hmm?

23:08.920 --> 23:14.000
SLURRED: 
- Now, keys. 
- Not sure you should drive, Buns.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.560
- Oh, no! I'm fine. Look.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.400
- I stand corrected. 
- Yep!

23:23.400 --> 23:26.880
- Thank you for a lovely evening,
Annabel. 
- Alison.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.600
- And no hard feelings about the
whole, you know?

23:30.600 --> 23:32.760
- No, no, no, no, a deal's a deal.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.520
I was thinking of doing a bank
transfer.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.680
- Ooh. Very modern.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.200
I'll "e-mail" you my details.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.800
- Great, great.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.600
And is that for your current account
or the Fiji account?

23:43.760 --> 23:45.200
- What's the Fiji account?

23:48.800 --> 23:50.240
- You know what?

23:50.240 --> 23:55.000
What's a little card game between
friends, eh?

23:55.000 --> 23:59.760
Let's... Let's just forget this
silly money nonsense.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.600
I'll sign over the access rights to
you - gratis -

24:03.600 --> 24:06.640
and pop the papers in the post first
thing.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.240
Come along, Bunny!

24:10.520 --> 24:11.880
- FARTING 
- Oof!

24:11.880 --> 24:13.840
- Was that lasagne beef?

24:16.920 --> 24:19.200
- How did you know he had a...?

24:19.200 --> 24:20.360
- Oh.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.560
- Thank you.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.480
- They're not here. 
- Oh.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.120
- They're upstairs watching Friends.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.520
- Oh. 
- Hmm.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.480
- This place is weird. 
- Yeah.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.120
- Look out, Bunny, that's the gate!

24:31.120 --> 24:33.080
- I can see it!

24:33.080 --> 24:35.400
- Still, that's one problem sol...
PIGEON COOS

24:35.400 --> 24:36.640
FLUTTERING

24:36.640 --> 24:38.320
DOG BARKS AND GROWLS

24:38.320 --> 24:39.560
CRUNCH!

24:39.560 --> 24:40.640
BOTH: 
- Ooh!

24:42.080 --> 24:48.280
Oh! I mean, I didn't like that
pigeon, but that is no way to go.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.520
- Better than being shot.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.840
- Yeah.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.440
Oh.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.480
Oh...

24:54.680 --> 24:56.800
- HE RETCHES

25:00.680 --> 25:02.080
- No second disc, guys.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.560
- Ugh! Could that BE any more
vexing?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.000
- You all right, mate?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.040
- GRUNTS SOFTLY

25:13.200 --> 25:16.440
- What is it, you know, about the
moon?

25:16.440 --> 25:18.040
Why do you care so much?

25:19.800 --> 25:23.560
- Before you was moonah.

25:23.560 --> 25:27.640
Before house was moonah.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.800
Everything come,

25:29.800 --> 25:30.960
everything go.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.840
But always there.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.480
Moonah.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.320
The only thing that's been here as
long as you have.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.680
- GRUNTS SOFTLY

25:55.480 --> 25:57.240
- Several of cubs.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.240
- Getting closer. 
- Knock-knock.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.680
I say that cos I can't, erm...

26:02.680 --> 26:04.960
I just wanted to say sorry...

26:04.960 --> 26:07.320
..for what happened at dinner. From
all of us.

26:07.320 --> 26:10.080
Well, mainly from me, because Julian
can take or leave you,

26:10.080 --> 26:12.720
and Lady Button's not keen, and as
for the Captain, well...

26:12.720 --> 26:15.240
- Pat, it's fine. I mean, well, no,
it isn't.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.320
But...we'll muddle through.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.960
- Eight of hearts!

26:18.960 --> 26:20.120
- Yeah!

26:20.120 --> 26:24.280
- Yeah. In that spirit, so to speak,

26:24.280 --> 26:27.280
I actually had a little favour I
wanted to ask.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.760
It's for Robin.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.960
- Right, so, are you going to get
the ghosts or...?

26:38.960 --> 26:40.920
- They're here.

26:40.920 --> 26:44.560
- We might've missed the ritual this
year, but...well...

26:45.840 --> 26:47.440
..to old friends!

26:47.440 --> 26:50.160
- ALL: 
- To old friends. 
- Old friends.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.320
- God, I miss booze.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.640
- Robin, light pollution.

26:56.640 --> 26:58.320
- Oh, yeah.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.160
- HE GRUNTS

27:07.520 --> 27:09.160
- Pray tell,

27:09.160 --> 27:10.520
how you doing?

27:10.520 --> 27:12.400
- No, don't. HE MOUTHS
