00:01.169 --> 00:02.839
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:02.923 --> 00:04.635
It's so wonderful being
all together again.

00:04.718 --> 00:05.929
‐[June grunts]
‐[Aunt Lydia gasping]

00:06.012 --> 00:06.931
[railway crossing bells ringing]

00:07.014 --> 00:08.684
Stop!

00:08.768 --> 00:11.314
[train horn blaring]

00:12.817 --> 00:14.655
[June] We're gonna go West.
We're gonna follow the tracks.

00:14.738 --> 00:16.449
‐[soldier] Chicago.
‐That one's going to the front.

00:16.534 --> 00:18.328
June, why would we go
to the front of a war?

00:18.411 --> 00:19.957
[June] Because that's where
they're still fighting.

00:20.082 --> 00:22.169
Chicago is still Chicago.
They're not giving up.

00:22.253 --> 00:23.714
‐June?
‐Janine, you have to jump.

00:23.798 --> 00:25.300
[Janine yelps]

00:25.384 --> 00:27.514
I love Nichole
but I never wanted to be a mom.

00:27.597 --> 00:29.768
Why do you feel you have to
clean up June's messes?

00:29.851 --> 00:33.191
Making up for when I got out
and she didn't, I guess.

00:33.275 --> 00:36.239
[Oona] I leave for the resupply
to Thunder Bay tomorrow night.

00:36.322 --> 00:39.538
You could always come with me.

00:39.621 --> 00:43.044
You can't keep me in the dark
and feed me lies and shit

00:43.128 --> 00:44.881
and expect me
to just be okay with it!

00:44.965 --> 00:46.301
I'm keeping us alive.

00:46.384 --> 00:48.305
Did you tell the Eyes
where to find us?

00:48.430 --> 00:50.893
Yes, I told them where you were.

00:51.562 --> 00:53.356
They had Hannah.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.404
This is an overview of force
strength along the border.

00:56.487 --> 00:57.949
Invasion options,
with commentary.

00:58.033 --> 01:00.913
I convinced the Council
to bring you in as a consultant.

01:04.295 --> 01:05.548
Who the fuck are you?

01:05.632 --> 01:07.719
We need your help.
We're trying to get to Chicago.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.096
Get them in the truck.

01:10.474 --> 01:13.313
[June] We need a place to stay.
We need some food.

01:13.396 --> 01:14.566
This isn't a charity.

01:14.650 --> 01:15.777
We can be useful.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.488
[Steven] Theresa will get you
some food.

01:17.572 --> 01:19.116
Which one of you
is staying with me?

01:19.200 --> 01:20.578
Either one of you is fine.

01:20.662 --> 01:21.872
You're not Mayday, are you?

01:21.955 --> 01:23.542
What's Mayday?

01:23.626 --> 01:26.507
We can't stay here.
We'll go someplace else, okay?

01:26.590 --> 01:27.717
You should change first.

01:30.765 --> 01:32.686
Here. We can stay.

01:38.154 --> 01:40.158
[kissing]

01:54.521 --> 01:56.567
[June laughs] Thanks.

02:14.477 --> 02:15.855
[Janine moans softly]

02:18.652 --> 02:20.656
[Janine and Steven
breathing heavily]

02:33.682 --> 02:35.268
[dog barking in distance]

02:35.937 --> 02:37.607
[explosion in distance]

02:42.115 --> 02:43.243
[Janine] Oh!

02:43.326 --> 02:45.121
[gunfire in distance]

02:50.215 --> 02:51.425
‐[loud explosion]
‐[glass breaking]

02:51.510 --> 02:53.388
[car alarm blaring]

02:53.429 --> 02:54.766
[man 1] Wake up!

02:55.685 --> 02:57.605
[guns firing]

03:02.239 --> 03:06.122
[man 2] Oh, fuck...
From the west side this time.

03:07.332 --> 03:08.209
[Janine] June?

03:08.293 --> 03:11.925
[Steven] Hey! It's not safe.
Get back in bed.

03:12.009 --> 03:13.679
[explosion]

03:23.406 --> 03:25.620
[gun fire
and explosions continue]

03:41.568 --> 03:43.572
[explosions continue]

03:59.269 --> 04:01.273
["Tainted Love"
playing on radio]

04:01.357 --> 04:03.111
[water splashing]

04:03.236 --> 04:05.240
[players cheering]

05:02.939 --> 05:04.233
[players groaning]

05:05.276 --> 05:07.030
How long's all that gonna last?

05:08.449 --> 05:10.245
Depends on the size of the camp.

05:11.957 --> 05:13.167
We're not keeping it,

05:13.794 --> 05:15.296
we're trading it.

05:16.633 --> 05:17.927
For weapons?

05:18.010 --> 05:19.556
Batteries. Fuel.

05:20.724 --> 05:22.394
At least I hope we score some.

05:22.477 --> 05:26.110
It sucks ass, hauling this shit
across town for nothing.

05:30.368 --> 05:32.915
Let me help.
Come on. I can come.

05:35.461 --> 05:36.882
That's Steven's call.

05:40.514 --> 05:41.516
Right.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.564
[sighs]

05:54.374 --> 05:56.963
‐Okay.
‐Yeah. A little higher. Good.

05:57.673 --> 06:00.888
‐Okay, now watch the thumb.
‐[Janine] Okay.

06:00.971 --> 06:03.434
‐[Steven] Watch the hand.
‐Mmm. This?

06:03.518 --> 06:04.896
[Steven] Yeah. Good, good.

06:05.396 --> 06:06.858
That's right. There you go.

06:06.942 --> 06:09.864
Yeah. Ready?
Now, find your target.

06:09.948 --> 06:12.536
‐[Janine] Mmm‐hmm.
‐Got it? And squeeze.

06:13.956 --> 06:14.958
[gun clicks]

06:15.041 --> 06:17.128
‐[Janine giggling]
‐Hold on. Try again. [laughs]

06:17.546 --> 06:18.548
Yeah.

06:18.632 --> 06:20.385
‐[Janine] Like that? Okay.
‐That part. Perfect.

06:20.468 --> 06:21.387
‐[Janine] Okay.
‐Okay.

06:22.013 --> 06:23.224
[clicks]

06:23.307 --> 06:24.811
[chuckles]

06:24.894 --> 06:26.690
‐There you go. You're a natural.
‐Did I get it?

06:26.773 --> 06:28.317
Thanks. Well,
you're a great teacher.

06:28.401 --> 06:29.529
Thank you.

06:29.612 --> 06:31.198
‐Yeah? Yeah?
‐Yeah.

06:32.868 --> 06:34.288
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

06:37.127 --> 06:39.381
I hear you're trading
with another camp.

06:39.464 --> 06:40.425
I wanna come.

06:41.553 --> 06:43.724
No. Fresh meat stays here.

06:47.188 --> 06:49.109
You really should let June go.

06:49.192 --> 06:52.282
She got a whole plane
full of kids out of Gilead.

06:52.992 --> 06:56.415
I mean, I wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for her.

06:56.498 --> 06:57.333
Literally.

07:05.349 --> 07:06.686
You do what I say.

07:06.770 --> 07:07.772
Yeah.

07:09.149 --> 07:10.234
Thank you.

07:18.042 --> 07:20.923
[soft music playing]

07:29.857 --> 07:31.861
[music continues playing]

07:38.415 --> 07:39.710
[Aunt 1] Do you want that?

07:39.794 --> 07:42.173
[Aunt 2] Mmm, no.

07:48.144 --> 07:49.605
[Aunt 3] Facing forward!

07:51.150 --> 07:53.572
Move. Move.

07:54.114 --> 07:56.076
‐[Aunt Cordelia] Gin.
‐[Aunt 3] Straight lines!

07:56.160 --> 07:57.162
[Aunt Cordelia] Lydia.

07:57.245 --> 07:58.582
[Aunt 3] Eyes forward!

07:58.665 --> 08:00.084
Shall we deal you in?

08:00.168 --> 08:02.380
Ah, no, thank you,
Aunt Cordelia.

08:02.463 --> 08:04.719
Perhaps... perhaps later.

08:04.802 --> 08:07.473
[Aunt 3] You there!
Stay with your partner!

08:08.560 --> 08:10.188
Let's go! Move!

08:11.900 --> 08:13.778
Blessed day, sisters.

08:13.862 --> 08:14.864
Oh!

08:14.947 --> 08:16.408
[automated voice]
Workout paused. Blessed day.

08:16.491 --> 08:18.412
Blessed morning, Aunt Ruth.

08:18.495 --> 08:19.916
Have you seen the new girls?

08:19.999 --> 08:22.378
Oh, by His hand,
we'll replace the lost children

08:22.462 --> 08:24.174
‐in no time with that crop.
‐Ah!

08:25.218 --> 08:27.681
Yes, a very special class.

08:29.392 --> 08:30.394
[sighs]

08:30.478 --> 08:33.400
Well, I am eager
to be of service again.

08:33.484 --> 08:36.406
Fully recovered,
by His grace.

08:36.490 --> 08:39.580
Back in fighting shape,
as they say. [chuckles]

08:39.664 --> 08:41.375
There's no need to rush.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.546
God has given you
this respite to heal.

08:43.630 --> 08:45.968
Ah, too much to be done.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.389
Lydia...

08:49.307 --> 08:52.063
the girls are not
your concern anymore.

08:57.115 --> 09:00.956
The girls have always
been my concern.

09:03.252 --> 09:07.595
I have served Gilead
with everything I have.

09:10.767 --> 09:11.853
Praise be.

09:21.914 --> 09:23.042
Aunt Ruth,

09:24.587 --> 09:26.924
perhaps you could
speak to the Commanders

09:27.008 --> 09:29.095
about my reinstatement.

09:31.517 --> 09:33.688
Intercede on my behalf.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.609
Lydia...

09:36.318 --> 09:40.786
I admired your devotion...
when you were still active.

09:42.163 --> 09:45.962
But now it is your time to rest.

09:46.046 --> 09:48.551
‐[Aunt 1] Another round?
‐[Aunt 2] No.

09:49.970 --> 09:51.056
[Aunt Ruth] Oh, good.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.477
An empty seat at the table.

09:55.147 --> 09:57.443
Godspeed, Aunt Lydia.

09:57.528 --> 09:59.489
Godspeed, Aunt Ruth.

10:04.917 --> 10:07.463
Godspeed, Aunt Ruth.

10:08.883 --> 10:10.052
[treadmill beeps]

10:10.136 --> 10:11.723
[automated voice]
Resume workout.

10:11.806 --> 10:14.018
[treadmill beeping]

10:16.398 --> 10:18.402
[breathing deeply]

10:25.374 --> 10:27.128
[Lawrence] Commanders, thank you

10:27.211 --> 10:30.468
for squeezing me in
before lunch.

10:30.552 --> 10:32.681
Council appreciates
your assistance

10:32.765 --> 10:35.144
in pursuing
the fugitive Handmaids.

10:35.937 --> 10:37.691
Happy to be of service.

10:37.775 --> 10:40.739
[Calhoun] I don't recall,
have they been recaptured?

10:40.822 --> 10:43.703
Or re‐recaptured, I should say?

10:43.787 --> 10:46.041
Not yet, no.

10:47.544 --> 10:49.088
Not yet.

10:49.172 --> 10:51.677
May God bless our endeavors.

10:53.347 --> 10:55.351
I'm afraid
we only have a few minutes.

10:56.228 --> 10:59.192
I'll get right to it, then.
Um... [clears throat]

11:01.363 --> 11:04.369
The world fears our military.

11:06.498 --> 11:10.256
We can destroy our enemies,
and they know it.

11:11.383 --> 11:13.638
But the sanctions
they've imposed

11:13.721 --> 11:16.101
have put our economy
in a chokehold.

11:16.184 --> 11:19.065
Guns alone will not win a war.

11:19.148 --> 11:20.902
We need money as well.

11:23.533 --> 11:27.123
I propose that we declare
a temporary ceasefire

11:27.206 --> 11:28.877
along our contested borders

11:28.960 --> 11:32.174
in Chicago,
California and Texas.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.468
A ceasefire?

11:33.553 --> 11:39.314
A few hours for
international aid to come in,

11:39.397 --> 11:41.903
for food and health care.

11:41.986 --> 11:44.198
[Calhoun] Those areas
are infested with terrorists,

11:44.282 --> 11:45.869
and you want to send in aid?

11:46.453 --> 11:49.500
I... I want to take
the moral high ground

11:49.585 --> 11:53.258
in order to hasten
the end of trade restrictions.

11:53.342 --> 11:54.637
A temporary show of mercy

11:54.720 --> 11:57.141
in exchange
for permanent revenue.

11:57.224 --> 11:59.228
[Calhoun] By aiding
and abetting terrorists?

11:59.772 --> 12:03.320
We could just hit them,

12:03.403 --> 12:07.244
hit them harder in Nevada
for a few months, couldn't we?

12:07.704 --> 12:09.165
Is there a difference?

12:09.248 --> 12:11.044
I think we can
keep up the military pressure

12:11.127 --> 12:13.131
on all insurgents in any case.

12:16.681 --> 12:18.392
Thank you, Commander.
Gentlemen...

12:19.937 --> 12:25.489
I am not proposing weakness
in any fashion.

12:28.078 --> 12:31.502
[Calhoun] Commander,
wasn't it your Handmaid

12:31.585 --> 12:34.132
who kidnapped our children
in the first place?

12:36.762 --> 12:37.973
It was.

12:40.562 --> 12:42.189
It was. I was...

12:43.568 --> 12:46.949
I was deceived
by a faithless woman.

12:49.663 --> 12:53.629
But now we are facing
elemental economic truths.

12:53.713 --> 12:57.763
And, gentlemen, unlike women,
numbers don't lie.

12:58.931 --> 13:02.021
If we can end these sanctions,
we can prosper.

13:02.104 --> 13:06.362
If we can prosper,
we can crush this insurgency.

13:08.075 --> 13:10.162
An intriguing proposal.

13:11.372 --> 13:12.834
All in favor?

13:15.297 --> 13:16.509
All opposed?

13:21.560 --> 13:22.562
Motion denied.

13:22.646 --> 13:24.148
‐Council adjourned.
‐[gavel strikes desk]

13:24.232 --> 13:25.652
Thank you, Commander Lawrence.

13:26.779 --> 13:27.781
You bet.

13:31.121 --> 13:32.582
Enjoy your lunch.

13:38.301 --> 13:40.640
You couldn't give me
a mercy vote?

13:40.765 --> 13:43.478
I can't support a ceasefire
in a battle I'm leading.

13:45.148 --> 13:47.236
[softly] A ceasefire
might help June.

13:50.409 --> 13:52.204
I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

13:52.246 --> 13:54.668
If she was near the border,
I'd know about it.

13:54.751 --> 13:55.587
Oh, that's sweet.

13:55.670 --> 13:57.841
Would your heart glow
or something?

13:57.924 --> 13:59.176
[chuckles]

13:59.887 --> 14:01.055
That's funny.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.061
It's a big country, Commander.

14:05.815 --> 14:07.569
The Eyes can't see everything.

14:09.322 --> 14:10.909
Not even the Eyes of Gilead.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.688
[explosion in distance]

14:30.280 --> 14:32.117
Hey. When do I get a gun?

14:32.953 --> 14:34.288
When you earn it.

14:38.589 --> 14:40.802
Can you try to make
things work here with Steven?

14:42.221 --> 14:43.683
Don't worry about it.

14:45.645 --> 14:47.272
It's... You're kinda pushy.

14:48.191 --> 14:49.276
Now, I'm used to it,

14:49.360 --> 14:51.615
but he's been in charge
for a long time, and you come in

14:51.699 --> 14:53.034
‐and you expect‐‐
‐Okay, okay, okay.

14:53.118 --> 14:54.370
[Steven] Hold up.

14:55.790 --> 14:57.585
[flies buzzing]

14:59.463 --> 15:00.842
[Steven exhales]

15:01.927 --> 15:02.929
Yuck.

15:03.388 --> 15:04.558
Who did this?

15:05.475 --> 15:07.939
Nighthawks. They don't care
if they live or die.

15:08.023 --> 15:10.235
They just wanna kill soldiers.

15:10.318 --> 15:11.404
You'd love 'em.

15:12.741 --> 15:14.243
You ever trade with them?

15:15.203 --> 15:16.707
They move around a lot.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.126
Used to be at the Art Institute.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.007
Last I heard, Mercy Hospital.
Now, who knows?

15:23.219 --> 15:25.223
[guns firing in distance]

15:26.017 --> 15:28.021
This place is gonna be
crawling with soldiers soon.

15:28.731 --> 15:29.900
We gotta move.

15:32.989 --> 15:35.243
[helicopter blades whirring]

15:38.542 --> 15:40.337
‐[helicopter approaching]
‐[explosion in distance]

15:40.462 --> 15:42.842
[soldier] Spread out!
Full sweep!

15:42.926 --> 15:45.055
Fuck! Come on.

15:45.138 --> 15:46.224
Shit! Come on!

15:54.699 --> 15:56.537
[helicopter hovering]

15:58.164 --> 15:59.668
[soldier] Watch for IEDs.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.713
[vehicle passing]

16:03.049 --> 16:04.511
Check all of 'em!

16:06.723 --> 16:08.059
Check all these doors!

16:09.813 --> 16:11.984
All doors.
All the way to the end.

16:17.035 --> 16:19.123
[indistinct chatter over radio]

16:27.306 --> 16:29.101
[breathing unsteadily]

16:30.020 --> 16:31.189
Shh.

16:37.744 --> 16:39.496
[indistinct chatter over radio]

16:43.631 --> 16:45.091
[soldier] This street is clear.

16:47.304 --> 16:48.306
Move out!

16:48.641 --> 16:50.603
[helicopter passing over]

16:51.521 --> 16:52.607
Hey, you have a clean shot.

16:52.690 --> 16:53.859
[whispering] Quiet.

16:53.943 --> 16:55.529
‐[vehicle engine revs]
‐They're getting away!

16:55.613 --> 16:57.241
I said, "Shut the fuck up!"

16:57.324 --> 16:58.911
[gun firing in distance]

17:00.288 --> 17:02.669
[distant explosion]

17:21.748 --> 17:23.209
Don't do that again!

17:23.293 --> 17:25.171
We could've taken them!
What's wrong with you?

17:25.255 --> 17:27.217
What happens
when they don't report back?

17:28.011 --> 17:31.350
Hmm? More patrols.
More soldiers.

17:31.434 --> 17:34.231
Makes it harder for us to
move around. It's not worth it.

17:37.614 --> 17:38.991
What kind of resistance are you?

17:40.870 --> 17:41.997
The kind that survives.

17:49.470 --> 17:51.516
[breath trembling]

17:57.319 --> 17:58.530
‐[man 1] Good.
‐[man 2] No.

17:58.614 --> 17:59.490
[man 3] Come on, man.

17:59.574 --> 18:00.576
[indistinct chatter]

18:08.842 --> 18:10.053
[male trader]
What do you want for that one?

18:10.095 --> 18:11.890
[female trader] Yeah, I'll throw
in a couple cans of beans, too.

18:11.973 --> 18:12.892
[male trader]
No. Try the hallway.

18:12.934 --> 18:13.936
There's a new guy there.

18:14.729 --> 18:15.815
[female trader]
What have you got?

18:16.273 --> 18:17.568
[female trader 2]
Come on, don't be an asshole.

18:17.652 --> 18:18.696
[female trader 3]
Be safe out there.

18:18.779 --> 18:19.948
[female trader 4]
Nah, not this time, man.

18:20.825 --> 18:23.580
[male trader 2] Caps,
vests here. Mint condition.

18:24.541 --> 18:25.876
Oh, here, let me help you
with that.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.630
It's okay, I got it. Thank you.

18:29.216 --> 18:30.051
I'm Brad, by the way.

18:33.015 --> 18:33.851
And you are?

18:35.186 --> 18:36.021
Uh...

18:36.648 --> 18:37.482
Not interested.

18:38.610 --> 18:39.571
I appreciate it.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.157
Well, uh,

18:41.240 --> 18:42.910
you know where to find me
if you need anything, so...

18:44.037 --> 18:46.125
[male trader 2] Caps. Vests.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.087
It's nice to see
you're making friends.

18:48.129 --> 18:49.339
[male trader 2] Caps. Vests.

18:49.423 --> 18:51.010
I don't need
that kind of friend.

18:51.928 --> 18:52.764
All right.

18:52.805 --> 18:53.807
[male trader 2] Mint condition.

18:55.603 --> 18:56.437
No way.

18:57.314 --> 18:58.149
Is that...

18:58.901 --> 19:00.361
[gasps]

19:00.445 --> 19:02.365
Wow. June.

19:03.994 --> 19:06.081
Steven is a baseball fanatic.

19:06.165 --> 19:07.543
He lost everything in the war.

19:08.587 --> 19:10.340
[gasps]
I have to get this for him.

19:11.593 --> 19:12.595
That's sweet of you.

19:14.348 --> 19:15.183
But?

19:17.229 --> 19:19.066
I just don't want him to
take advantage of you.

19:19.149 --> 19:20.276
‐That's all.
‐[Janine] I'm not.

19:22.155 --> 19:23.742
It's totally consensual.

19:26.080 --> 19:26.998
I really like him.

19:29.044 --> 19:30.255
Just don't get too attached.

19:31.465 --> 19:32.467
Life is short here.

19:34.346 --> 19:35.599
Life is short everywhere.

19:38.939 --> 19:39.816
Hey.

19:41.151 --> 19:42.320
Janine.

19:42.404 --> 19:45.326
Hey. How about this cloak
for the Cubs hat?

19:46.036 --> 19:46.872
No.

19:47.707 --> 19:49.502
But it's... It's really warm,

19:49.586 --> 19:51.380
and it doesn't have
any holes in it or anything.

19:51.463 --> 19:53.217
You can...
You can use as a pillow

19:53.301 --> 19:55.096
‐or a blanket.
‐[man] You got anything else?

19:55.890 --> 19:56.725
Um...

19:58.854 --> 20:00.440
‐No.
‐[man] Sorry.

20:06.995 --> 20:08.331
[man] Hey, you see about
those mattresses?

20:10.669 --> 20:11.963
Hey, how about two cloaks?

20:14.844 --> 20:15.721
Sure.

20:16.388 --> 20:17.223
Really?

20:18.977 --> 20:19.812
[Janine] Here you go.

20:20.313 --> 20:21.273
‐[man] Thanks.
‐Thank you.

20:22.568 --> 20:23.820
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

20:24.112 --> 20:26.241
You know what,
I'll tell Steven.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.496
Maybe, he'll be nicer to you.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.960
I don't...
I don't need you to do that.

20:31.043 --> 20:32.212
[Janine] I know.

20:32.295 --> 20:34.968
‐But I want to.
‐Okay.

20:36.136 --> 20:37.682
‐Just help me with this stuff.
‐[Janine] Okay.

20:44.737 --> 20:45.572
[guitar music playing]

20:50.624 --> 20:51.626
[melancholy music playing]

21:01.103 --> 21:02.022
[clears throat]

21:07.449 --> 21:09.787
Something's different about you.

21:14.839 --> 21:16.383
Did you change your hair?

21:18.597 --> 21:19.807
I know it's late.

21:19.891 --> 21:21.226
Thank you for seeing me.

21:24.357 --> 21:25.276
It's the good stuff.

21:27.197 --> 21:28.575
[sniffs, clears throat]

21:28.658 --> 21:29.577
Have a seat.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.123
No, thank you. I'll...

21:33.417 --> 21:34.252
I'll stand.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.090
[grunts] Suit yourself.

21:36.173 --> 21:37.050
[exhales]

21:38.469 --> 21:39.304
[sighs]

21:40.264 --> 21:41.810
To what do I owe the pleasure?

21:43.437 --> 21:45.984
I believe
I can be of service to you.

21:46.653 --> 21:47.530
Lucky me.

21:48.532 --> 21:49.700
[Aunt Lydia] I have sources.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.873
Witnesses to your involvement

21:52.957 --> 21:55.002
in Commander Winslow's
disappearance.

21:57.340 --> 21:58.217
Is that right?

21:59.010 --> 22:00.973
In addition, I have testaments

22:01.056 --> 22:02.810
to your many abuses of power.

22:04.396 --> 22:05.649
Black market activity.

22:06.818 --> 22:08.362
Not to mention
your collaboration

22:08.445 --> 22:10.617
with your handmaid
Ofjoseph.

22:13.999 --> 22:14.917
Unless?

22:16.295 --> 22:19.552
Unless you arrange for
my immediate reinstatement.

22:19.802 --> 22:20.637
There it is.

22:22.641 --> 22:24.311
For a second, I thought
you didn't have it in you.

22:27.943 --> 22:30.406
is it that you didn't hear me,
Commander?

22:30.489 --> 22:31.910
No. No, I heard you.

22:33.997 --> 22:34.916
Loud and clear.

22:36.502 --> 22:37.337
Mmm.

22:40.092 --> 22:40.928
So, uh...

22:44.644 --> 22:45.562
What else you got?

22:46.146 --> 22:47.148
I beg your pardon?

22:47.858 --> 22:49.528
I get it. You can bury me.

22:53.745 --> 22:55.164
I can only imagine

22:55.248 --> 22:59.089
the goods you have
on my illustrious colleagues.

22:59.172 --> 23:00.717
Commander Calhoun.

23:03.264 --> 23:04.725
What's the dirt on him?

23:05.309 --> 23:07.313
I'm not one
to traffic in gossip.

23:08.399 --> 23:10.278
You just tried to blackmail me.

23:11.113 --> 23:12.365
Hardly gossip.

23:17.793 --> 23:19.588
You want me
to restore your position,

23:19.672 --> 23:21.300
I need my seat
back at the table.

23:21.383 --> 23:24.055
And your information
can help me get it.

23:32.573 --> 23:34.994
Let's fix this country.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.503
Let's make things right again.

23:42.718 --> 23:43.553
Together.

23:47.770 --> 23:52.654
I might consider a collaboration
if I have your word

23:52.738 --> 23:55.201
that Ofjoseph
would be put in my care.

23:56.662 --> 23:57.790
To be disciplined.

23:58.750 --> 24:00.754
Handled my way.

24:07.141 --> 24:08.310
I can live with that.

24:10.189 --> 24:11.024
Good.

24:24.217 --> 24:26.722
[indistinct chatter]

24:33.068 --> 24:33.903
Hey.

24:34.864 --> 24:35.699
[whispering] Okay.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.705
I think we should go tomorrow
and find the Nighthawks.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.086
Come on. We came here to fight.

24:42.796 --> 24:44.215
June, you came here to fight.

24:44.884 --> 24:47.556
I didn't even want to come here.
I wanted to go back to Boston.

24:47.639 --> 24:49.392
There's nothing for us
in Boston.

24:51.313 --> 24:53.860
Well, there's...
There's something here.

24:57.158 --> 25:00.957
I can get pregnant again here.
I could keep my baby.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.251
I'd be like a real mom.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.798
Janine, you can't have
a baby here.

25:06.009 --> 25:06.969
Why not?

25:07.513 --> 25:09.600
I mean, come on.
We can be moms together.

25:11.102 --> 25:12.396
It'd be like a normal life.

25:13.482 --> 25:16.279
I mean, the world needs
more baby Americans, right?

25:17.658 --> 25:19.077
You sound like Aunt Lydia.

25:21.456 --> 25:23.043
No, June, you do.

25:23.711 --> 25:26.007
You're so bossy and judgmental.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.886
I mean,
I know what's right for me.

25:27.970 --> 25:29.138
He's taking advantage of you.

25:29.222 --> 25:31.059
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

25:31.142 --> 25:32.980
I... I see fine.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.399
[scoffs]

25:35.652 --> 25:37.446
It was my choice
to start having sex.

25:37.531 --> 25:40.452
You need to stop
trying to save me

25:40.537 --> 25:42.039
to make yourself feel better.

25:42.123 --> 25:44.377
I'm the one who doesn't wanna
see you get hurt.

25:45.630 --> 25:46.464
Okay?

25:49.597 --> 25:51.391
Maybe you should've
thought about that

25:51.474 --> 25:52.686
with Alma and Brianna.

25:56.151 --> 25:56.986
[sighs]

26:01.494 --> 26:02.330
Okay.

26:03.123 --> 26:04.500
Well, I'm leaving tomorrow.

26:05.461 --> 26:07.799
Come with me or stay here
and be Ofsteven.

26:07.883 --> 26:09.135
It's your choice.

26:19.782 --> 26:20.617
[breathing heavily]

26:32.264 --> 26:33.851
[vehicle beeping]

26:36.022 --> 26:37.191
[engine stops]

26:38.443 --> 26:39.655
[helicopter hovering]

26:53.933 --> 26:55.310
That star on your shoulder
doesn't mean

26:55.394 --> 26:57.148
you can round us up
like Unwomen.

26:57.858 --> 26:59.235
If you want to
arrange a shipment,

26:59.318 --> 27:00.655
go through the normal channels.

27:01.866 --> 27:03.160
No, this isn't about business.

27:04.663 --> 27:05.999
I'm looking for June Osborn.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.961
Fuck June Osborn.

27:08.044 --> 27:09.631
Lori, shut up.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.303
A lot of brave women died
trying to protect her.

27:13.221 --> 27:16.019
Everyone that helps her ends up
on the fucking wall.

27:17.438 --> 27:18.398
I know.

27:19.818 --> 27:20.653
I'm sorry.

27:28.920 --> 27:29.963
I care about her.

27:36.392 --> 27:37.353
What can you tell me?

27:38.063 --> 27:39.357
You're better off without her.

27:48.543 --> 27:51.882
Two Handmaids were spotted
heading into Chicago a week ago.

27:52.466 --> 27:53.844
Maybe June was one of them.

28:00.148 --> 28:00.984
Thank you.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.785
[vehicle doors close]

28:10.127 --> 28:11.672
So once you get across
this checkpoint,

28:11.755 --> 28:13.300
just keep the lake on your left

28:13.383 --> 28:15.470
and it's a straight shot
all the way.

28:16.849 --> 28:17.809
Thank you, Brad.

28:19.521 --> 28:20.480
I'm June, by the way.

28:21.316 --> 28:24.740
Well, if you, uh,
ever find your way back here,

28:25.533 --> 28:26.367
look me up.

28:27.286 --> 28:28.121
Okay.

28:33.716 --> 28:34.593
‐Hi.
‐Hey.

28:35.469 --> 28:36.304
[Janine clears throat]

28:37.724 --> 28:41.230
Um, well, this is, uh,
kinda hard to say.

28:42.358 --> 28:44.403
We've been through so much
together. [chuckles softly]

28:45.113 --> 28:46.199
Yup, sure have.

28:52.294 --> 28:53.129
I'm staying.

28:56.260 --> 28:57.806
Yeah, I had a feeling.

29:03.859 --> 29:05.195
I guess this is it.

29:06.782 --> 29:07.617
Yep.

29:13.546 --> 29:15.675
Well, that baby's gonna be
really lucky to have you.

29:18.681 --> 29:21.060
And those rebels
are so lucky to have you.

29:27.030 --> 29:27.866
[sniffles]

29:31.497 --> 29:33.961
I need you to take care
of yourself, okay?

29:34.044 --> 29:34.880
Okay.

29:36.048 --> 29:37.050
[shakily] Cross my heart.

29:38.344 --> 29:39.180
Okay.

29:50.452 --> 29:51.287
Wait!

29:53.626 --> 29:54.628
Here.

29:59.554 --> 30:00.848
Just something
to remember me by.

30:00.932 --> 30:01.767
[chuckles softly]

30:06.150 --> 30:08.363
How could I forget you?
[chuckles softly]

30:10.408 --> 30:12.120
Who could forget
the girl with one eye?

30:12.747 --> 30:13.749
[laughs]

30:15.795 --> 30:17.297
I think you're beautiful.

30:18.801 --> 30:19.761
You, too.

30:27.944 --> 30:28.779
[whispers] Bye.

30:34.791 --> 30:35.626
[sighs]

31:20.716 --> 31:24.306
You are the sacred vessels
of the Lord.

31:25.016 --> 31:27.062
His chosen ones.

31:29.943 --> 31:31.947
Your charge will be hard.

31:34.661 --> 31:37.583
You will be tested
by wicked men,

31:38.167 --> 31:40.589
and they will try
to lead you astray.

31:42.593 --> 31:48.104
And when they do,
I will be here to listen.

31:50.651 --> 31:53.741
Your bond with each other
will be strong.

31:56.162 --> 31:57.665
From this day forward,

31:57.749 --> 32:03.134
none of you
will ever walk alone again.

32:13.655 --> 32:14.949
[sighs and sniffles]

32:38.997 --> 32:39.833
[indistinct chiming]

32:49.351 --> 32:51.272
[metal rattling]

33:06.427 --> 33:07.262
[papers rustling]

33:29.306 --> 33:30.350
[objects rumbling indistinctly]

33:38.575 --> 33:39.409
[breathing heavily]

33:46.382 --> 33:47.760
[footsteps approaching]

33:54.899 --> 33:55.734
Hi.

34:18.321 --> 34:19.574
What are you doing here?

34:21.118 --> 34:22.663
I feel safer
when we're together.

34:24.542 --> 34:26.880
Handmaids always
walk in twos, remember?

34:35.021 --> 34:36.691
Yeah. Come on.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.353
Commander Lawrence.

34:56.313 --> 34:58.860
Commander Blaine, blessed day.

35:01.281 --> 35:02.283
You were right.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.914
I think she's in Chicago.

35:05.666 --> 35:06.500
Hmm.

35:07.377 --> 35:10.258
Well, whatever you need,
I'll back you.

35:12.596 --> 35:14.349
It's good to have you
on board, Commander.

35:23.117 --> 35:24.286
[Commander Putnam]
Okay, gentlemen.

35:24.369 --> 35:26.331
Let's move on
to the next order‐‐

35:26.415 --> 35:27.375
[Nick] Excuse me, commander.

35:27.877 --> 35:29.212
Before we continue,
I'd like to return

35:29.296 --> 35:31.801
to Commander Lawrence's
proposal for a ceasefire.

35:32.553 --> 35:35.057
Commander Blaine,
you have read my mind.

35:35.141 --> 35:37.605
Council has had time to reflect.

35:37.688 --> 35:38.857
And we agree.

35:38.940 --> 35:39.984
Yes.

35:40.067 --> 35:41.613
Gilead's forces
in disputed areas

35:41.696 --> 35:44.619
will stand down for 24 hours
starting this afternoon.

35:45.788 --> 35:47.958
You were so adamant
in your opposition.

35:48.042 --> 35:49.461
I've changed my mind.

35:50.087 --> 35:55.181
God loves a Commander willing
to reconsider his position.

35:57.686 --> 36:01.736
The NGOs are standing by,
ready to deploy aid.

36:01.820 --> 36:05.284
Tell them that they are free
to move in as of 1600 hours.

36:06.495 --> 36:08.792
Commander Blaine,
you will coordinate the bombing.

36:14.386 --> 36:15.346
Excuse me, sir?

36:17.685 --> 36:19.689
Commander Blaine
was not fully briefed

36:19.772 --> 36:22.110
on the details of our agreement.

36:22.193 --> 36:23.028
Ah.

36:23.112 --> 36:24.489
Commander Blaine,
you will coordinate

36:24.574 --> 36:27.872
an aerial bombardment
on all insurgent fronts

36:27.955 --> 36:30.586
just prior to
the ceasefire deadline.

36:31.504 --> 36:33.424
Give the insurgents
a little spanking.

36:34.719 --> 36:37.056
With respect, any civilians
moving to receive aid

36:37.140 --> 36:38.058
will be vulnerable.

36:38.602 --> 36:41.273
You can't hunt the roaches when
they're in the walls, son.

36:41.356 --> 36:43.820
Unfortunately true, Commander.

36:47.243 --> 36:50.041
It's the cost of doing business,
as they say.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.297
Well, I don't believe
there's enough time

36:53.380 --> 36:55.301
to pull out
our own troops, so...

36:55.969 --> 36:58.390
Then you should get going.

37:07.910 --> 37:08.745
By His hand.

37:09.747 --> 37:10.582
By His hand.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.351
I think we should follow
the highway, see?

37:20.434 --> 37:21.353
Hmm, yeah.

37:21.436 --> 37:23.107
[metal clanking]

37:25.403 --> 37:27.281
Do you think the Nighthawks
will accept us?

37:27.365 --> 37:28.409
Fucking better.

37:56.131 --> 37:57.383
Where are all the soldiers?

38:00.014 --> 38:00.932
I don't know.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.543
Holy shit! All this food!

38:19.010 --> 38:20.514
They must have left in a hurry.

38:21.891 --> 38:23.853
Do you think the Nighthawks
attacked them?

38:24.730 --> 38:26.191
They wouldn't have
left the food here.

38:28.613 --> 38:30.491
At least someone up there
still likes us.

38:40.637 --> 38:41.471
Janine?

38:42.014 --> 38:42.850
What?

38:44.269 --> 38:45.605
Something's not right.

38:53.705 --> 38:55.207
[airplanes approaching]

39:02.180 --> 39:03.766
‐[explosion]
‐Run!

39:04.267 --> 39:05.102
[explosion]

39:41.884 --> 39:42.719
[rumbling]

40:10.357 --> 40:11.318
[man cries out in pain]

40:15.618 --> 40:17.038
[woman cries out in pain]

40:21.756 --> 40:22.549
[grunts]

40:28.101 --> 40:28.936
[woman] Help!

40:29.730 --> 40:31.316
Help, please!

40:37.662 --> 40:38.831

40:41.629 --> 40:42.631
[breathing heavily]

40:45.553 --> 40:46.388

40:49.477 --> 40:50.814
‐[man 1] Hey!
‐[woman] No!

40:52.818 --> 40:53.653
[groans]

40:53.736 --> 40:54.571
[indistinct shouting]

40:58.328 --> 40:59.163
[coughs]

41:01.544 --> 41:02.378
[man 3] Help!

41:04.006 --> 41:04.842
Help!

41:05.927 --> 41:06.929
[breathing unsteadily]

41:10.520 --> 41:11.689
[indistinct shouting]

41:21.249 --> 41:22.627
[woman] Help me!

41:26.969 --> 41:27.888
[man 3] Help!

41:28.639 --> 41:29.975
[man 2] We're here to help!

41:30.518 --> 41:32.647
Call out if you can.
We'll find you!

41:32.731 --> 41:33.774
[indistinct shouting]

41:33.858 --> 41:34.776
Janine?

41:35.444 --> 41:36.780
[man 1] Help me!

41:38.618 --> 41:39.578
[indistinct groaning
and grunting]

41:39.661 --> 41:40.496
[June] Janine?

41:42.626 --> 41:43.544
[man 3] Help!

41:46.090 --> 41:47.594
Janine!

41:48.220 --> 41:50.390
[man 3] Help! Help!

41:58.406 --> 42:04.418
[woman sobbing] Come on!
We gotta go! We gotta go!

42:05.630 --> 42:06.757
[man 2] It's not safe!

42:11.725 --> 42:13.103
[man 2] Is somebody there?

42:17.319 --> 42:18.196
[man 4] Is anybody there?

42:18.280 --> 42:19.533
Janine!

42:21.620 --> 42:22.539
[indistinct shouting]

42:25.377 --> 42:26.755
[sirens approaching]

42:33.226 --> 42:34.646
‐[air horn blows]
‐[man 5] Pair up.

42:34.730 --> 42:35.982
[woman 1] Help is here.

42:36.065 --> 42:38.486
[man 5] Spread out.
All right, pair up.

42:38.571 --> 42:40.073
‐[man 6] You okay?
‐[man 5] Yeah, over there.

42:40.157 --> 42:42.369
‐[woman 2 screams] I'm in here!
‐[man 5] Two of you, over there!

42:46.419 --> 42:47.254

June?
