00:16.160 --> 00:19.240
<i>I was there.</i>
<i>When the shots were fired.</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:22.120
<i>We've been attacked</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

00:22.200 --> 00:25.040
<i>Two decades to tear it all down.</i>

00:26.680 --> 00:30.480
<i>Chaos, suffering, loss.</i>

00:30.560 --> 00:32.640
<i>That's what forms us.</i>

00:32.720 --> 00:33.760
<i>Shapes us.</i>

00:34.360 --> 00:38.480
<i>You deal with pain,</i>
<i>or you let pain deal with you.</i>

00:38.560 --> 00:41.120
<i>We must choose to let this pain</i>
<i>make us stronger.</i>

00:46.800 --> 00:49.960
<i>What we love, our culture,</i>

00:50.920 --> 00:53.160
<i>has taken 2,000 years to grow.</i>

00:54.840 --> 00:56.120
<i>Through suffering.</i>

00:57.360 --> 00:58.640
<i>And pain.</i>

01:20.520 --> 01:23.400
<i>Two decades for them</i>
<i>to tear it all down.</i>

01:25.040 --> 01:27.960
<i>They want us to obey</i>
<i>and kneel for Islam.</i>

01:36.880 --> 01:39.440
<i>This is what</i>
<i>this election is all about.</i>

01:39.520 --> 01:43.120
<i>If our leaders won't protect us,</i>
<i>protect our children,</i>

01:43.200 --> 01:44.720
<i>then we must rise.</i>

01:45.800 --> 01:46.680
<i>Fight back.</i>

01:54.040 --> 01:57.240
<i>In the last hour, there have been</i>
<i>several attacks on Muslim citizens</i>

01:57.320 --> 01:59.760
<i>in Berlin, Hanover,</i>
<i>Stuttgart and Dresden.</i>

01:59.840 --> 02:02.560
<i>In Cologne,</i>
<i>a refugee center was set on fire,</i>

02:02.640 --> 02:06.000
<i>and racial slurs</i>
<i>were sprayed on cars.</i>

02:06.080 --> 02:09.160
<i>Official sources confirm</i>
<i>that yesterday's terror attack</i>

02:09.240 --> 02:13.800
<i>claimed the lives of NAD leader</i>
<i>Rudolph Hensel and his wife.</i>

02:13.880 --> 02:18.760
<i>Their daughter Emilia is in an ICU.</i>
<i>Her condition remains critical.</i>

03:35.800 --> 03:37.160
What's the matter now?

03:39.360 --> 03:42.960
-You got me arrested.
-Just wait and see.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.720
It was worth it.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.720
-What happened to the internet?
-I had to shut it off.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.800
I'm testing the firewall.

04:23.760 --> 04:28.560
-I'll take a walk and clear my head.
-No. We have a lot of work to do.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.320
Why the hell didn't you
tell me about the shooting?

04:34.760 --> 04:38.480
-Cato asked me to give you...
-No, that's bullshit.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.320
-Stop treating me like a kid.
-Come here.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.880
I'll show you something.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.840
<i>The number of anti-Muslim</i>
<i>demonstrations is growing.</i>

04:55.080 --> 04:57.120
<i>I did nothing.</i>
<i>They took me to a car.</i>

04:57.200 --> 04:59.200
They are hunting Muslims everywhere.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.080
Because they found
a Muslim man on the scene.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.520
I've planted digital tracks
in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.360
A Muslim terror network
on German soil.

05:10.440 --> 05:15.640
And now we must use this momentum
to spread anger and polarize.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.120
You're going to feed that rage.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.720
Turn sparks into flames.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.360
<i>...and kiosks were attacked.</i>

05:22.440 --> 05:26.760
<i>Men and women alike are being</i>
<i>attacked in the streets.</i>

05:26.840 --> 05:32.720
<i>Help, I beg of you. We have children.</i>
<i>We haven't done anything.</i>

05:32.800 --> 05:35.600
<i>I don't know. 50 or 60 people.</i>

05:35.680 --> 05:38.960
<i>We saw that this door</i>
<i>was forced open.</i>

05:39.040 --> 05:41.000
<i>Then they came in through here.</i>

05:41.080 --> 05:43.600
<i>At a refugee hostel in Potsdam,</i>

05:43.680 --> 05:47.440
<i>just a few hours after the shooting</i>
<i>of the NAD leader...</i>

05:50.240 --> 05:51.480
Eva.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.120
-Here's the investigation report.
-Thank you.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.840
I'll be with the Verfassungsschutz.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.000
Are you coming?

06:00.280 --> 06:01.440
Eva.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.880
How is the daughter?

06:03.560 --> 06:04.600
She's in surgery.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.760
-Will you keep me updated?
-Yes, of course.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.000
<i>This was an act of terror.</i>
<i>And people are scared.</i>

06:12.080 --> 06:15.240
You have to show that you take
their feelings seriously.

06:15.320 --> 06:20.680
Polling has shown that you can appear
opportunistic, exploiting the attack.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.320
I recommend a calmer role.
Don't create more fear.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.320
-A calm role?
-Yes.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.880
You might as well hand the election
to the populists.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.000
People feel threatened
and want to feel safe.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.920
And while the NAD are saying
that they have been right all along,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.200
you want to us to prudently withdraw?

06:39.280 --> 06:42.760
If we make a mistake,
the NAD will take over the country.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.520
It will ruin Minister Hardenberg's
chances to become the new leader.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.840
This will either build
or end political careers.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.480
Spare me your rhetoric.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.440
You're relieved of your duties.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.360
Excuse me?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.440
Need an explanation?

07:02.520 --> 07:05.480
Fine. Politicians have every right
to complain

07:05.560 --> 07:08.000
when their party leader is shot.

07:08.080 --> 07:13.080
And you know why? Because it was
our duty to protect him.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.280
If I act indecisive,
then I take the fall.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.200
So clean out your desk,
and don't talk to anyone about this.

07:21.080 --> 07:27.160
Ruben, you will take over his duties.
So everything will go via his office.

07:28.280 --> 07:32.080
The Islamists want to sow hatred,
but we won't give it to them.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.440
Instead, we will give them
a show of strength.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.080
What do we know about them?

07:38.160 --> 07:41.280
Chat logs from the sniper's phone
indicate he had collaborators.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.520
How many?

07:43.120 --> 07:45.480
He was in extensive contact
with two people.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.080
Kasim Shaibi and Sailib Buran.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.760
Buran is already in custody.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.560
We're still trying to locate Shaibi.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.880
We are tracking 15 others
of their contacts.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.720
-Have you made their names public?
-No, to avoid them going into hiding.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.800
But it would help
tracking them down quicker.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.120
We fear further acts of revenge.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.440
Release their names, pictures
and everything we have on them.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.840
It is our duty to inform the public
and to deliver results.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.480
I will do the informing.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.680
And I expect you
to provide quick results.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.640
Or I have no other option
than to relieve you of your duties.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.960
<i>The protesters shout</i>
<i>anti-Muslim slogans and...</i>

08:29.040 --> 08:30.920
There's been new polls, too.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.760
Sympathy for the NAD
just keeps rising.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.800
Cato is waiting for a text from you.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.680
-Then get me online.
-The text first.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.400
Hey, are you okay?

08:50.120 --> 08:52.360
<i>You're not climbing,</i>
<i>you're in Berlin.</i>

08:53.680 --> 08:54.760
<i>Ole, I'll come...</i>

08:54.840 --> 08:57.720
-No, Sigrid. No, you won't.
<i>-I'm coming.</i>

08:58.400 --> 09:01.680
<i>No. Listen to me. You are not</i>
<i>to talk to anyone about this.</i>

09:04.360 --> 09:06.200
Is Ragna there? Can I talk to her?

09:07.840 --> 09:08.720
Yes, she's here.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.080
Can you talk to Sigrid?

09:11.160 --> 09:14.040
Say whatever you want, but she's not
coming here. Make it quick.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.320
Hi. How are you?

09:16.400 --> 09:19.040
<i>I don't want to be alone anymore.</i>
<i>I miss you guys.</i>

09:19.760 --> 09:22.280
-We miss you too.
<i>-Ragna, I'm scared.</i>

09:22.360 --> 09:24.480
I see what's going on down there.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.120
The Muslims are destroying our world.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.360
<i>Don't think like that.</i>

09:29.440 --> 09:32.760
You're a good person,
and everything will be okay.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.160
I have to go, but you have
to stay where you are,

09:36.240 --> 09:37.880
and we'll talk soon.

09:37.960 --> 09:42.160
<i>-Ragna, no...</i>
-Okay? We'll talk soon.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.320
<i>Bye.</i>

09:52.320 --> 09:55.600
He wants us to release the names
and pictures of all our suspects.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.480
What? But we are still
mapping out the network.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.360
Yes, it's a power play.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.240
And he threatened to suspend me.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.120
Maybe someone should tell him
that his male ego isn't helping

10:08.200 --> 10:09.680
the fight against terror.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.120
What are you doing here?

10:12.360 --> 10:15.280
The whole situation is very tense.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.440
We need to talk about our next steps.
I need all available intel.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.800
Yes. You'll get it. We're on it.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.640
I need to know what Eva's department
knows and vice versa.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.320
There's an election going on
while people are rioting,

10:27.400 --> 10:30.360
but you don't communicate
with me anymore.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.920
I get the feeling you're hiding
something from me.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.960
Over a week ago you gave this to me.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.240
You never told me where it came from.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.000
Why are you keeping
important information from me?

10:49.360 --> 10:52.000
Can we go back to the work
that really matters?

10:54.040 --> 10:56.840
I asked you to gather intel
on this lawyer. Where is it?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.600
You can find it all in here.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.880
-I want him under surveillance.
-He is a lawyer!

11:02.960 --> 11:05.560
You know we can't do that.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.880
Just give me what I need
to do my job. That's all I am asking.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.720
The daughter, Emilia...

11:16.000 --> 11:17.720
The surgeons couldn't save her.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.560
Do you really want me to release
the pictures to the media?

11:27.200 --> 11:28.240
Yes.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.800
What is this? This isn't good enough.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.760
It's not even close.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.520
Where's your anger, Ragna?

12:11.440 --> 12:15.160
Furia was a witness
to this atrocity. Look here.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.360
See how these images
and texts are spread all over.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.840
Every media is covering this.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.720
Look at what they're writing.
It's the same narrative. Identical.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.840
And you think words
can change the world.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.320
No. I know they can, Ragna!

12:37.960 --> 12:40.880
That's why it's so important
that you use your words correctly.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.400
<i>Hospital officials have confirmed</i>

12:50.480 --> 12:53.160
<i>that Emilia Hensel,</i>
<i>daughter of Rudolph Hensel,</i>

12:53.240 --> 12:57.640
<i>has died of her injuries.</i>
<i>She was only five years old.</i>

12:57.720 --> 13:02.280
In order to change Europe, we have
to get Germany to shift to the right.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.120
If we can push them far enough,
the EU falls apart.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.280
But the sacrifice has
to be big enough.

13:07.360 --> 13:13.320
You want me to provoke to get
a bigger counter-reaction too?

13:13.400 --> 13:17.080
Yes. Polarize. Action, reaction.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.240
The louder we are, the louder
they have to defend the Muslims.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.640
And when everyone's attention
is on them, we will prove them wrong.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.840
Once and for all.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.960
With an event
that will go down in history.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.600
Your blog has a lot of traction.
We need to use that anger.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.400
Action, reaction, and acceleration.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.200
<i>This video is of unknown origin.</i>

13:48.120 --> 13:50.800
This will make Furia travel
like never before.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.640
So go and write as if Europe's
future is at stake, because it is.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.880
-Thank you for that.
-Sure.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.600
How are you?

14:20.320 --> 14:22.600
It feels like
my country is coming apart.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.040
So...

14:25.680 --> 14:27.800
What is it
you wanted to tell me?

14:30.320 --> 14:34.400
I... There's just something
I started thinking about today.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.680
In '85, there was this case
in New York.

14:40.320 --> 14:44.680
Michael Holly. He was shot
five times in the back. He died.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.200
There was a lot of evidence,
and all the evidence pointed to a guy

14:48.280 --> 14:50.000
called Mickey Featherstone.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.800
And he was a member of the Westies,

14:51.880 --> 14:54.880
which was organized crime,
like the Mafia.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.560
And so he was sentenced
to 25 years in jail.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.400
And later they found out

15:01.480 --> 15:05.960
that all of that evidence
was planted by their rivals.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.400
The Gambino family.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.360
And...

15:10.200 --> 15:13.040
I just can't stop thinking
about that story today.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.280
You know...

15:15.560 --> 15:18.880
What if you're going after
the wrong people this time?

15:20.960 --> 15:22.600
The cell I'm following,

15:23.520 --> 15:26.280
they are capable
of so much more than we think.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.760
I just know it.

15:29.920 --> 15:33.840
And they came to Berlin,
and now this happens.

15:37.880 --> 15:42.000
So you think
your cell carried out the attack.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.160
I think it's possible.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.640
But we have massive amounts
of messages between the suspects.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.520
We have a dead Muslim shooter.
So all of that must have been rigged.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.560
-Everybody we arrested is...
-Yeah.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.120
They want them
to take the blame for everything.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.560
I just can't afford
to be wrong again.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.040
I failed, people died.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.280
I mean,
we can't just act on a hunch.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.640
I know.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.880
We need evidence.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.040
Yeah.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.240
There might be something
to help prove your theory.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.760
There is this lawyer.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.760
Help me find out
who he is financing.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.000
I think he's connected
to the Russian money.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.680
<i>I was there.</i>

16:50.120 --> 16:51.760
<i>When the shots were fired.</i>

16:52.720 --> 16:55.400
<i>We have been attacked</i>
<i>like this before.</i>

16:55.480 --> 16:58.480
<i>Two decades to tear it all down.</i>

16:59.160 --> 17:01.880
<i>This is what</i>
<i>this election is all about.</i>

17:01.960 --> 17:04.200
This isn't just
an attack on Germans.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.560
It's an attack on all Europeans.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.320
On Christianity.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.080
Good. Post it.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.120
I was thinking,
if I could talk to Cato, I can...

17:16.200 --> 17:18.240
Stop yapping about him.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.600
Post it. I need video and text now.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.160
Fuck!

18:28.840 --> 18:32.000
<i>On behalf of the German government</i>
<i>I strongly condemn</i>

18:32.080 --> 18:35.800
<i>the atrocious attacks</i>
<i>against our fellow Muslim citizens.</i>

18:35.880 --> 18:39.560
<i>The terror attack in the run-up</i>
<i>to the federal election</i>

18:39.640 --> 18:42.360
<i>was an assassination attempt</i>
<i>on our democracy,</i>

18:42.440 --> 18:44.760
<i>and hence on all of us.</i>

18:45.720 --> 18:49.280
The attack was carried out
by terrorists, not Muslims.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.880
<i>We will continue to do everything</i>
<i>in our power to protect the citizens</i>

18:53.960 --> 18:57.960
<i>and democracy of this country.</i>

18:58.040 --> 19:02.480
So far, 44 suspects
have been arrested.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.200
And we will also find the leader
of this terror cell

19:06.280 --> 19:08.840
and hold him accountable.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.840
That I can promise you.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.600
<i>Where were you on Thursday,</i>
<i>and who did you have contact with?</i>

19:15.680 --> 19:18.960
<i>-I was with my family. At home.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

19:19.040 --> 19:21.640
<i>Here it is, black on white.</i>
<i>Monday, Tuesday...</i>

19:23.720 --> 19:26.040
<i>Let me go!</i>

19:27.200 --> 19:29.440
<i>No!</i>

19:34.280 --> 19:35.680
What is your impression?

19:40.040 --> 19:43.920
He denies the facts
and is obviously afraid.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.960
Why do you ask?

19:49.440 --> 19:51.840
Did you read the autopsy report?

19:53.680 --> 19:56.200
-Because of the bullet angle?
-Yes.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.440
It estimates there is only
a 20% chance of suicide.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.920
That's just statistics. I mean...

20:06.680 --> 20:12.480
-20% isn't such a low probability.
-20% isn't low?

20:12.560 --> 20:15.080
-If we begin doubting everything...
-20%, Eva.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.560
-Yes.
-Excuse me.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.320
-Hi.
<i>-I just got a message.</i>

20:20.400 --> 20:23.640
<i>The shooting wasn't Islamists,</i>
<i>but the right-wing cell.</i>

20:23.720 --> 20:25.240
Are you sure about this?

20:25.320 --> 20:27.600
<i>Yes. But she needs to find Cato,</i>
<i>the leader,</i>

20:27.680 --> 20:32.200
to be able to stop what she says
is the next attack. She's close.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.000
Inger, we are rounding up
and arresting suspects

20:35.080 --> 20:38.200
that discussed the attack
with the shooter. I need proof.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.920
<i>Listen, I've asked my agent</i>
<i>to give me more info.</i>

20:41.680 --> 20:43.720
But don't ruin her chances now.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.720
<i>What about Ruben?</i>
<i>You can trust him, right?</i>

20:47.800 --> 20:50.520
I don't know. As fate would
have it, he's my new boss now.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.680
<i>You need allies above your rank.</i>

20:52.760 --> 20:55.560
When Cato is exposed,
you need to act fast.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.120
You have to find a way, Kathi.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.320
Are you okay?

22:05.920 --> 22:07.400
Is there anything I can do?

22:08.960 --> 22:10.480
No, it's just...

22:12.600 --> 22:13.840
Brehme being...

22:16.080 --> 22:17.600
a problem.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.280
In what way?

22:33.480 --> 22:35.080
No, he...

22:38.400 --> 22:42.280
Sorry, I've just been so focused
on this the last few days.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.480
We are so close.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.240
You know I think
your writing is amazing.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.840
It's not about that.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.320
Yes, I've just arrived.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.080
Good.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.640
Yes, I'll wait.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.280
<i>Everything is under control.</i>

24:36.280 --> 24:37.800
Yes, clearly.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.840
Is that why you have changed
your appearance?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.920
You're paying Cato
to influence the election.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.200
Your Russian client will get
the results he wants.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.280
Just to be clear,
I'm not paying for anything.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.480
I'm the middle-man.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.000
But if I recall correctly,
we have an agreement.

25:01.720 --> 25:03.360
That you will deliver.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.240
-It's going according to plan.
-Don't tell me.

25:07.240 --> 25:11.040
The less I know,
the smaller the risk to my client.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.680
And what about the picture of you?
In Verfassungsschutz?

25:19.520 --> 25:23.320
-Did you think we wouldn't find out?
-It's been taken care of.

25:23.400 --> 25:26.960
The interior minister still believes
he can be the next chancellor.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.400
His outlook will change very quickly,
we can promise that.

25:30.480 --> 25:35.680
And no one will ever know
your client was involved.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.520
I hope so.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.360
For your sake.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.280
You won't get a second chance.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.120
Are you threatening me?

25:56.920 --> 25:58.200
Me? No.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.960
But maybe my client.

26:33.680 --> 26:34.760
Hey, Ruben.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.520
Thanks for coming.
I need to talk to you.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.800
Let me go first.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.480
Listen. The suspects we imprisoned...

26:44.560 --> 26:48.160
All evidence we have
is digital communications.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.920
But no evidence of them
ever meeting in person.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.400
You don't need to physically meet
to organize a terror plot.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.440
Okay, sure.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.680
But I looked at
the interrogation transcripts again.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.160
The whole...

27:04.840 --> 27:08.520
The whole thing is supposed to look
like an Islamist terrorist attack.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.160
It's all fake.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.880
-Look...
-Kathi.

27:13.920 --> 27:16.560
Do you know what will
happen if information leaks out

27:16.640 --> 27:20.120
that you peddle
conspiracy theories like this?

27:20.200 --> 27:22.000
The autopsy report.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.720
The bullet angle suggests that
this was most likely not suicide.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.560
There's an 80% possibility
he was killed.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.160
Don't let your own
political opinions interfere.

27:33.240 --> 27:34.680
Opinions?

27:34.760 --> 27:37.920
You wouldn't act like this
if the victim was a Social Democrat.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.680
You're such an asshole.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.000
I never agreed to any of this.

28:27.240 --> 28:31.360
There was talk of intimidation
and getting rid of radical Islamists,

28:31.440 --> 28:33.800
but not the assassination
of a politician

28:33.880 --> 28:36.360
or the murder of a child.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.440
There are casualties in every war.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.080
I can't be a part of this anymore.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.440
Why? You are locking up
Muslim radicals,

28:43.520 --> 28:45.400
so it's all going according to plan.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.560
Just look at what
is going on right now.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.640
A huge wave is sweeping
across Europe.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.200
Islamism is in on the retreat,
exactly like you wanted.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.160
And that's why you supported us
all those years.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.000
The price is too high for me.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.640
And they are getting closer.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.440
You are still on their radar.

29:46.360 --> 29:51.360
Find out if they can actually tie me
to anything. By tomorrow.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.200
Then I'll get you out.
Go wherever you want.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.320
It's been good working with you.

31:39.320 --> 31:43.400
Yes! Ragna! It worked!

31:45.040 --> 31:47.320
Your post has gone viral.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.040
The Interior Minister has commented.

31:49.120 --> 31:52.080
He writes that people must stop
attacking Muslims.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.880
This is good.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.960
Ragna?

32:00.880 --> 32:02.640
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.600
Did you hear what I said?

32:06.920 --> 32:08.520
You're amazing.

32:13.560 --> 32:14.720
I just wanted to...

32:17.720 --> 32:22.640
I know I've had
to keep a lot secret from you.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.880
There's been stuff
I couldn't tell you.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.080
But...

32:30.000 --> 32:32.840
I'm afraid you're going
to hate me if I tell you this.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.760
Why would I hate you?

32:40.280 --> 32:42.000
There is no Cato.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.120
Cato's just someone you invented?

32:57.600 --> 33:00.920
I used Cato as a symbol.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.600
An inspiration.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.120
Okay?

33:12.400 --> 33:14.600
Then you should tell me
what happens next.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.040
What the fuck?

33:34.800 --> 33:36.160
We are moving, now.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.760
The Norwegian cop who shot
your brother. He was after me today.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.920
You sure it was him?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.480
Just wait.
I have another surprise for you.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.360
Move.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.400
Fuck.

34:29.680 --> 34:32.400
So he meets this woman.
They talk for a while.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.840
They go their separate ways.
I keep following Brehme.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.880
And he must
have been warned somehow.

34:38.680 --> 34:42.080
At least we know for sure there's
a connection to the Russian money.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.480
Yeah, for sure.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.320
Are you okay?

34:47.400 --> 34:48.640
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.080
The problem is, he saw me.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.640
Sigrid?

35:12.360 --> 35:13.480
Sigrid!

35:14.440 --> 35:16.960
Relax. It's going to be fine, okay?

35:17.040 --> 35:17.880
This is on you.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.120
It's going to be okay, Sigrid.
Take it easy.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.840
She called you from the airport.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.560
This is why I'm here.

35:25.640 --> 35:29.440
Finding security breaches
and fixing them.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.240
Stop questioning me.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.720
First the cop.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.640
Then her.

35:39.760 --> 35:40.920
I'll blow your head off.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.200
I will.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.000
Ole.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.600
Ole, don't do it.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.600
I'm not gonna take
any more bullshit from you.

35:55.680 --> 35:59.200
Cato and this movement was my idea.
Don't you ever forget that.

35:59.280 --> 36:02.000
Lower your weapons!

36:05.640 --> 36:08.200
Cato was supposed to be a secret.

36:08.280 --> 36:12.880
Cato was supposed to be a symbol
of our fight together.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.880
Now look what you're doing.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.800
It's okay.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.800
-Did you search her?
-All her stuff is in that bag.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.600
Don't worry, Sigrid.
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

36:24.680 --> 36:26.240
Ragna's going with you.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.280
It's gonna be fine.

36:28.360 --> 36:32.040
You have to go with her.
I'll try to get her out of here.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.960
Brehme is paranoid,
but he needs me.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.200
And I need him.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.800
I'll tell you everything, I promise.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.760
I promise. Just go with her now.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.240
Damn it.

37:11.880 --> 37:13.560
-Yes?
<i>-It's Ruben.</i>

37:14.360 --> 37:16.160
<i>I have bad news.</i>

37:18.000 --> 37:20.600
<i>-Eva has been murdered.</i>
-What?

37:21.600 --> 37:25.680
<i>Her tongue was cut out,</i>
<i>a ritual you find among ISIS groups.</i>

37:27.880 --> 37:30.640
<i>You are suspended</i>
<i>until further notice.</i>

37:32.040 --> 37:34.520
<i>Your conspiracy theory is wrong...</i>

37:38.520 --> 37:39.360
Get inside.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.600
Ragna, I'm scared.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.120
He said he was going
to take us somewhere.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.520
Just try to calm down.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.960
And don't say anything
to anyone but Ole and me.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.520
You're Furia.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.280
I read your last post, about how
we must stand up to what's happening.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.960
You shouldn't have come here.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.640
I've read Cato's blog too.
If that's Ole, what is he doing here?

38:08.720 --> 38:11.200
Just don't say anything.
Don't say anything.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.840
How dare you
threaten my niece like that!

38:15.800 --> 38:18.720
-Just do your job. I'll do mine.
-No! That's the wrong answer.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.800
And I swear to God I will
have you removed. You work for me!

38:25.200 --> 38:27.960
Even so, our movement is bigger
than both of us.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.400
We need to be united.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.600
Dad said we should be Identitarians,
but this does not look like that.

38:37.680 --> 38:41.200
Calm down. And don't say a word.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.920
-We start tomorrow.
-No, we cannot just skip a day.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.480
No one will waste energy

38:49.560 --> 38:52.760
looking for either one of us
after we're done.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.720
We must do it now.
You know it's right.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.000
No. You don't get to fuck with me
anymore. Do you hear me?

38:59.200 --> 39:03.120
I want you to forget everything
you have read or thought about that.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.240
Okay?

39:06.720 --> 39:11.360
Right now, Ole and I need you to be
a normal, naive girl from Vestvik.

39:12.680 --> 39:13.680
Okay?

39:15.120 --> 39:19.360
And no matter what
they say or do, you'll stay calm.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.000
Can you trust me?

39:23.760 --> 39:24.880
Yes.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.480
Ole.

39:30.640 --> 39:31.800
We are ready.

39:33.480 --> 39:36.280
You know,
it's more risky to wait a day.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.720
People will see
the world as we do.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.600
Can you promise to look after me?

39:52.840 --> 39:54.040
Please.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.760
Yes.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.360
I will look after you.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.560
I promise.

40:14.800 --> 40:21.320
<i>Eva Puck's heroic work in the fight</i>
<i>against terrorism will be cherished.</i>

40:22.000 --> 40:23.560
<i>We have made mistakes</i>

40:23.640 --> 40:27.400
<i>which have now been rectified</i>
<i>through personnel changes.</i>

40:28.200 --> 40:31.680
<i>We will find those culpable</i>
<i>and hold them accountable.</i>

40:31.760 --> 40:34.440
<i>The security</i>
<i>in this country is assured.</i>

40:34.520 --> 40:36.400
<i>And I promise you</i>

40:36.480 --> 40:39.920
<i>that with the help</i>
<i>of our excellent police force</i>

40:40.000 --> 40:43.680
<i>I will continue to do everything</i>
<i>possible so this remains the case.</i>

40:44.880 --> 40:47.720
-He's throwing you under the bus.
-Yeah.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.400
I don't care
about my reputation right now.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.400
A colleague got murdered.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
What happened?

40:58.080 --> 41:01.160
Killed by Muslim sources,
they believe.

41:01.880 --> 41:05.440
<i>Eva Puck's murder is the reason</i>
<i>for his public statement.</i>

41:05.520 --> 41:08.720
<i>The circumstances surrounding</i>
<i>the killing are unclear.</i>

41:08.800 --> 41:10.120
<i>Sources within the police...</i>

41:10.200 --> 41:11.480
That's the woman I saw.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.600
With Brehme.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.040
Are you sure?

41:19.320 --> 41:20.280
I'm sure.

41:20.360 --> 41:24.760
<i>Reliable sources state that objects</i>
<i>seized at the crime scene</i>

41:24.840 --> 41:27.680
<i>suggest that Eva Puck could</i>
<i>have been working as an informant</i>

41:27.760 --> 41:31.640
<i>for an Islamist terror organization.</i>

41:43.400 --> 41:45.080
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.760
-Good morning, Thomas.
-Morning.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.840
Good morning.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.000
Could you please hand these out?

42:08.360 --> 42:10.400
-Good morning.
-Hello.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.680
Quiet in the back. We'll start
with page four, third paragraph.

43:15.040 --> 43:18.080
The task is as follows:
You'll consider...

43:32.880 --> 43:35.680
That's it for today.
Then I want to know, when the...

43:47.200 --> 43:48.320
To the ground.

43:48.400 --> 43:49.760
What is this?

43:49.840 --> 43:51.560
Shut up! <i>Yalla!</i>

44:05.440 --> 44:06.960
Don't scare the pupils.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.480
<i>Ole?</i>

44:58.680 --> 45:01.520
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>
<i>How are we doing?</i>
