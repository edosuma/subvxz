<i>GloboTech Industries, long recognized
as the worldwide leader...</i>

01:05.503 --> 01:08.919
<i>...in high-tech weaponry,
is now reaching even higher.</i>

01:09.006 --> 01:11.498
<i>Under the leadership of CEO, Gil Mars...</i>

01:11.592 --> 01:16.469
<i>...GloboTech engineers are blazing the trail
into tomorrow's most exciting sector.</i>

01:16.806 --> 01:19.262
<i>Introducing advanced
battlefield technology...</i>

01:19.351 --> 01:22.103
<i>...into consumer products
for the whole family.</i>

01:22.187 --> 01:26.101
<i>For the first time, you and yours will enjoy
the same high quality standards...</i>

01:26.191 --> 01:30.484
<i>...as demanded by the Defense Department,
at private sector prices.</i>

01:30.571 --> 01:35.362
<i>GloboTech, turning swords into plowshares
for you and your family.</i>

02:01.017 --> 02:03.424
He's here. He's early.

02:03.519 --> 02:06.436
He's not supposed to be here yet.
He said...

02:07.607 --> 02:09.479
Slamfist optimal. Good. Check.

02:10.943 --> 02:12.603
Chickens.

02:13.613 --> 02:15.440
Let me help you with these.

02:16.449 --> 02:17.694
Pretty exciting, huh?

02:17.783 --> 02:21.200
I don't know. I think it's kind of sad.

02:21.329 --> 02:24.615
Heartland Toys has a long tradition
of bringing joy to kids.

02:24.708 --> 02:26.829
Gil Mars won't care about that.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.874
He's just going to care about profits.

02:28.961 --> 02:30.124
I think it sucks.

02:30.212 --> 02:33.249
Welcome to Earth. You may not be
familiar with our customs...

02:33.341 --> 02:36.212
...but things work like this down here,
in the real world.

02:36.302 --> 02:38.093
Well, the real world sucks.

02:38.221 --> 02:40.260
It does have its perks.

02:41.431 --> 02:46.059
Gentlemen, I'm Ms. Kegel,
executive assistant to Mr. Mars.

02:48.606 --> 02:51.524
Let me be the first to welcome you
to the GloboTech family.

02:51.609 --> 02:57.195
Just as he's done with his computer,
telecommunications and food divisions...

02:57.323 --> 03:01.272
...Mr. Mars intends to bring his own
personal touch to Heartland Play Systems.

03:01.953 --> 03:03.032
Well, that's good.

03:07.165 --> 03:08.625
All right.

03:09.459 --> 03:10.623
These are...

03:11.796 --> 03:13.339
Where's everybody else?

03:13.421 --> 03:15.462
There is no longer any "everybody else".

03:15.549 --> 03:17.626
Mr. Mars, it's an honor...

03:17.719 --> 03:20.802
Cut the kiss-ass.
After I leave, I won't remember your name.

03:20.888 --> 03:22.167
This is Irwin Wayfair.

03:22.681 --> 03:25.765
I'm told you two are responsible for this.

03:25.893 --> 03:29.227
Yes, sir. That's Flatchoo,
he's part of the Belch Brigade.

03:29.396 --> 03:31.886
Actually, the whole line was Irwin's idea.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.319
Once I did the marketing, it was the most
successful product in company history.

03:40.408 --> 03:43.907
That's why I bought the place
and why you two are still onboard.

03:44.119 --> 03:46.691
So, let's talk about the future.

03:53.296 --> 03:57.458
Okay, these are Gorgonites. They...
Hi. How are you today?

03:57.549 --> 03:58.628
I'm late.

03:59.342 --> 04:02.545
Okay. I drew up some pictures.

04:02.679 --> 04:04.838
That's a picture you can have.

04:06.808 --> 04:10.012
All right, these are Gorgonites.

04:10.104 --> 04:11.218
And this one.

04:11.312 --> 04:15.061
This is Archer.
He's the grand, noble leader of...

04:15.567 --> 04:18.105
Okay, and Troglokhan...

04:18.195 --> 04:21.029
...the navigator who navigates.

04:21.238 --> 04:25.569
Okay, they're monsters
from the land of Gorgon.

04:25.659 --> 04:28.780
They've come to our world and are lost.
To return to Gorgon...

04:28.871 --> 04:31.659
...they have to learn all about our world.

04:31.748 --> 04:34.668
This way, kids can learn and do research...

04:34.753 --> 04:37.040
Excuse me. Did you say "learn"?

04:37.547 --> 04:39.005
Learn, yeah.

04:40.092 --> 04:40.790
Next.

04:42.302 --> 04:43.712
Mr. Mars...

04:44.887 --> 04:47.558
...let me introduce you to...

04:49.767 --> 04:51.260
...Major...

04:54.021 --> 04:57.522
...Chip Hazard,
leader of the Commando Elite.

05:00.653 --> 05:03.654
It's called multimedia, Irwin. Look into it.

05:07.076 --> 05:09.365
<i>The future is here.</i>

05:09.829 --> 05:12.155
<i>A new age has dawned...</i>

05:13.499 --> 05:15.492
<i>...for action!</i>

05:22.884 --> 05:26.217
<i>The world's most awesome
high-tech fighting force...</i>

05:26.304 --> 05:29.803
<i>...is ready to battle for
the next millennium.</i>

05:29.974 --> 05:32.051
<i>Chip Hazard, reporting for duty!</i>

05:32.143 --> 05:33.802
Wait. Hold on.

05:34.687 --> 05:37.772
Hold on, hold on. Can they really do that?

05:38.191 --> 05:40.563
- Do what?
- Punch out of the box.

05:41.444 --> 05:42.274
No.

05:42.862 --> 05:44.321
I didn't think so.

05:44.405 --> 05:47.773
There's a disclaimer.
Legal says we're completely covered.

05:48.158 --> 05:49.902
You know what I'm sick of?

05:50.494 --> 05:53.864
Commercials showing trucks
popping up on Mount Rushmore...

05:53.957 --> 05:56.079
...and parking on Abraham Lincoln's head.

05:56.209 --> 05:59.826
And shampoo commercials that say
women can look like Claudia Schiffer...

05:59.920 --> 06:02.493
...after one cycle of rinse and repeat.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.378
What if these toys actually could talk?

06:05.467 --> 06:08.801
What if they could walk?
What if they could actually kick ass?

06:09.263 --> 06:10.211
<i>Nick Nitro.</i>

06:11.015 --> 06:13.885
Toys that are so smart
when kids play with them...

06:13.975 --> 06:15.351
...they play back.

06:15.436 --> 06:19.019
Toys that actually do what they do
in the commercials.

06:19.691 --> 06:21.563
That's an interesting idea.

06:21.650 --> 06:23.607
Forget the "Batteries not included" crap.

06:23.693 --> 06:26.066
Put in a lifetime GloboTech lithium cell.

06:26.155 --> 06:29.322
They'll run forever.
That'll piss off the guys at Eveready.

06:30.952 --> 06:35.162
How's this slogan? "The Commando Elite.
Anything else is just a toy."

06:35.413 --> 06:37.536
"Everything else is just a toy."

06:37.708 --> 06:39.783
That's good, too. Sure.

06:39.960 --> 06:40.992
Sir?

06:42.003 --> 06:45.954
You know, that kind of computing power
doesn't really seem feasible...

06:46.050 --> 06:49.881
Irwin, we're part of GloboTech.
We can find the technology.

06:50.095 --> 06:55.337
Our missiles can find a bastard 7,000 miles
away and stick a warhead up his ass.

06:55.475 --> 06:59.223
This won't be a problem. They're soldiers.
What do soldiers need?

06:59.855 --> 07:02.012
- Hats?
- Camouflage?

07:02.983 --> 07:04.145
Ms. Kegel?

07:04.318 --> 07:05.267
Enemies, sir.

07:05.361 --> 07:09.406
Enemies. See, these hideous,
ugly freaks are the enemy...

07:09.490 --> 07:12.159
...and our guys have to find them
and vaporize them.

07:12.575 --> 07:15.327
No, they're not... Sir?

07:16.580 --> 07:18.702
Don't you think that's a bit violent?

07:18.789 --> 07:21.708
Exactly. So call it action, not violence.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.166
Kids love action. It sells.

07:24.296 --> 07:28.127
Besides, what are you worried about?
They're only toys.

07:31.261 --> 07:35.508
I can't believe this. This is really wrong.

07:35.640 --> 07:39.258
It's a total perversion of everything
I designed these Gorgonites to be!

07:39.353 --> 07:41.807
Can it, Irwin. This is a golden opportunity.

07:41.897 --> 07:44.849
If we pull this off,
Mars will be eating out of our hands.

07:44.941 --> 07:46.399
By the way, gentlemen...

07:46.485 --> 07:49.818
...Mr. Mars expects the product
ready for shipment in three months.

07:49.946 --> 07:51.145
Three months?

07:51.240 --> 07:54.655
No. It takes at least six months.

07:54.826 --> 07:56.902
There's product testing and focus...

07:56.995 --> 08:00.079
Three months is fine.
Tell Mr. Mars they'll be ready then.

08:00.165 --> 08:01.540
All right, then.

08:02.126 --> 08:03.751
These are your security cards.

08:03.835 --> 08:07.702
They give you unlimited access
to all top-secret Globo technology.

08:07.964 --> 08:12.841
And these are your individual,
secret passwords. Memorize them now.

08:16.097 --> 08:17.425
Mine's "Gizmo."

08:17.682 --> 08:19.673
I said "secret."

08:26.691 --> 08:30.191
Password. Password.
What's my password?

08:35.533 --> 08:36.695
Gizmo.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.413
Let's find us some chips.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.286
Some really good chips.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.457
A lot of really good chips.

08:58.221 --> 08:59.800
The X1000.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.348
Hello, Mr. Chips.

11:10.145 --> 11:13.644
This looks like a nice store.
Look at those toys.

11:13.732 --> 11:17.066
Come on, Grandma.
This place never has anything good.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.131
Hey, Alan.

11:49.391 --> 11:51.218
How's the world treating you?

11:51.310 --> 11:54.264
- You, Joe, are the highlight of my day.
- Jeez, tough break, kid.

11:54.855 --> 11:57.856
- New truck?
- New owner. See?

12:01.028 --> 12:03.946
Soon everything will be owned
by one giant corporation.

12:04.281 --> 12:06.274
Then, it's good-bye microbreweries.

12:06.617 --> 12:08.694
So, where's your dad? I got his order.

12:08.786 --> 12:11.409
He's going out of town tonight
for a seminar.

12:11.748 --> 12:13.953
Wait a second. He left you in charge?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.918
I was as surprised as you.

12:17.002 --> 12:20.916
I think he's starting to trust me again.
Or maybe he didn't have a choice.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.751
What's the seminar?

12:23.967 --> 12:26.969
"How to make a success
of your small business."

12:27.387 --> 12:29.179
I suggested torching the place.

12:29.264 --> 12:33.512
Not a good idea. Arson forensics
nowadays are very sophisticated.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.016
"Gorgonites and Commando Elite."

12:42.443 --> 12:43.524
What are those?

12:45.781 --> 12:46.978
Let's find out.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.662
Ten-hut!

12:58.836 --> 13:01.505
Major Chip Hazard, reporting for duty, sir!

13:03.215 --> 13:05.540
Wow. Voice activated. Not bad.

13:06.427 --> 13:10.175
They move, they talk.
They got a built-in, two-way radio.

13:10.847 --> 13:14.098
"Buy a second commando
and communicate with a friend."

13:18.229 --> 13:19.973
Halt! Who goes there?

13:20.773 --> 13:24.190
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

13:26.864 --> 13:28.822
Awfully polite for a monster.

13:29.199 --> 13:32.318
You never have to replace the battery.
That's a good thing.

13:33.954 --> 13:37.620
Hey, Joe. Do you think you could
front me a set of these?

13:38.250 --> 13:38.783
What?

13:39.168 --> 13:41.954
Sort of lend them to me.
You got plenty in the truck.

13:43.963 --> 13:46.170
That's Toy World's inventory
for the month.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.131
This order's paid for.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.008
I'll pay you back after I sell them.

13:50.094 --> 13:52.301
What about your dad's policy, no war toys?

13:52.389 --> 13:56.220
Don't worry about my dad.
By the time he gets back, they'll be sold.

13:56.309 --> 13:58.385
And we'll have made some money for once.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.974
I don't know.

14:02.941 --> 14:05.099
You're saying that never in your career...

14:05.360 --> 14:07.981
...has anything just fallen off
the back of the truck?

14:08.072 --> 14:10.064
I don't like your tone.

14:10.156 --> 14:10.939
Sorry.

14:11.324 --> 14:12.568
It's too loud.

14:14.494 --> 14:16.616
Okay, one whole set.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.488
I'll lose the paperwork someplace.

14:19.625 --> 14:22.874
- I had better not regret this.
- You won't. I swear.

14:23.003 --> 14:25.160
And you've got to get them off the truck.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.881
<i>- I could get in trouble for this.
- No one will know.</i>

14:29.049 --> 14:32.669
<i>They better not. These toys don't go
on sale officially until Monday.</i>

14:32.763 --> 14:36.013
<i>I could loose my job.
I could loose my house.</i>

14:52.949 --> 14:55.071
Thanks, Joe. I owe you one.

14:55.701 --> 14:57.160
You owe me twelve.

14:59.413 --> 15:00.992
Good luck, kid.

15:19.976 --> 15:21.470
Freeze!

15:44.417 --> 15:46.456
I wanted to go to Toy World.

15:46.544 --> 15:49.414
Life is full of disappointments.
Go look around.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.923
His birthday's next week.
Mom said I had to take him shopping.

15:54.218 --> 15:56.625
Great. What kind of stuff is he into?

15:57.512 --> 16:01.297
Dinosaurs, mutants.
Anything that maims, kills or destroys.

16:01.851 --> 16:03.049
I just got in...

16:03.143 --> 16:06.595
You're Alan Abernathy.
You moved into the house behind mine.

16:07.106 --> 16:08.683
I've heard about you.

16:08.856 --> 16:10.482
- You have?
- Yeah.

16:11.777 --> 16:14.149
How come I never see you after school?

16:14.988 --> 16:16.482
I'm kind of stuck here.

16:16.782 --> 16:18.573
What kind of toy store is this?

16:19.076 --> 16:21.863
It's my dad. He thinks these toys are cool.

16:22.412 --> 16:24.238
Too bad nobody else does.

16:25.374 --> 16:28.577
The Commando Elite will rid the Earth
of the Gorgonites.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.337
The Gorgonites are peaceful.
We mean no harm.

16:32.757 --> 16:36.504
Gorgonite, you are a hideous freak.
You will be vaporized.

16:37.719 --> 16:40.674
Civilian, declare your allegiance.

16:42.391 --> 16:43.387
Cool.

16:44.059 --> 16:46.016
I know what I want!

16:46.104 --> 16:51.098
I want the soldier! They're walking
and fighting and they're so cool!

16:53.569 --> 16:54.647
Where'd they go?

16:57.448 --> 16:59.071
What about this one?

16:59.158 --> 17:01.149
No, I want the other one.

17:01.493 --> 17:03.948
Major Chip Hazard. He's the one.

17:04.078 --> 17:05.905
- How much are these?
- A lot.

17:05.998 --> 17:08.239
Mom and Dad won't buy you one of these.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.703
Yes, they will.
They buy you those stupid Gwendy dolls.

17:12.045 --> 17:13.752
All right, Timmy.

17:15.632 --> 17:17.625
Save me one of the buff guys.

17:17.717 --> 17:20.209
- And a monster, too.
- I don't think so, brat.

17:20.303 --> 17:23.887
- I'll find it and hold it till tomorrow.
- How about the flame-thrower?

17:25.642 --> 17:29.473
- When will I get that toy?
- Never, if you don't shut up.

17:32.691 --> 17:34.517
Say "hi" once in a while.

17:58.007 --> 18:00.795
- Meet death with honor, coward.
- There you are.

18:08.767 --> 18:11.259
Congratulations. You're practically sold.

18:13.064 --> 18:14.724
You, I'm not so sure about.

18:19.570 --> 18:21.230
Troglokhan.

18:26.660 --> 18:27.989
Punch-it.

18:31.206 --> 18:33.199
Oh, man! Dad's ticket!

18:37.505 --> 18:39.794
Okay, suitcase...

18:39.882 --> 18:42.718
...briefcase, keys. Keys.
Where are my keys?

18:42.926 --> 18:44.587
Right where you left them.

18:44.678 --> 18:46.504
And where did I leave them?

18:49.725 --> 18:52.180
What is wrong with me? What else?

18:52.311 --> 18:54.184
Stuart, please, try to relax.

18:54.271 --> 18:58.314
Remember why we moved here.
To get away from the stress.

18:58.775 --> 19:00.769
To eliminate the stress.

19:01.070 --> 19:02.563
To...

19:02.780 --> 19:04.606
...exhale...

19:05.408 --> 19:06.985
...the stress.

19:11.120 --> 19:15.119
Mom! I know what I want for my birthday.
I want a Major Chip Hazard.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.998
- Don't upset your father.
- Hi, Dad.

19:18.087 --> 19:19.829
- Hi, sweetie.
- What's up?

19:19.963 --> 19:22.122
- AI here was just telling me...
- Ed.

19:22.257 --> 19:25.258
He was telling me the angle
of the Earth's tilt on its axis...

19:25.344 --> 19:28.298
...relative to the orbit
of the transmission satellite...

19:28.388 --> 19:31.804
...restricts the placement
for optimum reception.

19:32.685 --> 19:34.060
Yeah.

19:34.270 --> 19:37.270
In other words, this tree is in the way.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.348
Right. Exactly.

19:40.484 --> 19:42.642
<i>No problema.</i>

19:50.159 --> 19:51.738
Knock that off!

19:51.829 --> 19:55.742
Stuart, dish guy says the tree has to go.
You don't mind, do you?

19:55.874 --> 19:57.950
- Yes, I mind!
- What?

19:58.336 --> 20:02.996
I said, "yes, I mind!" What the hell
are you doing, Phil? This is my tree!

20:03.297 --> 20:08.588
Happy to do the work. What are neighbors
for? Isn't the dish a beauty?

20:08.679 --> 20:11.845
No. This tree is beautiful.

20:12.182 --> 20:15.135
That dish is just one more piece
of techno-crap...

20:15.267 --> 20:18.387
...to go along with the rest
of your stockpile of techno-crap!

20:18.521 --> 20:22.306
You're already pulling so much juice,
you got us living in a cancer node.

20:22.443 --> 20:24.732
There's never been
any conclusive data linking...

20:24.820 --> 20:26.363
Give me that saw, Phil.

20:26.446 --> 20:29.814
Stuart, come on.
Airplane now, vendetta later.

20:29.908 --> 20:33.988
I'll check the zoning laws,
but I think they'll prove me right.

20:41.002 --> 20:44.003
Hasn't he heard of the dishes
that go on top of your house?

20:44.089 --> 20:45.831
Maybe they don't get as many channels.

20:45.924 --> 20:47.382
He probably got a deal.

20:47.467 --> 20:48.083
Dad!

20:50.262 --> 20:52.587
Alan, you're supposed to be in the shop.

20:53.682 --> 20:54.962
You forgot your ticket.

20:55.557 --> 20:57.218
My ticket.

20:57.310 --> 21:00.062
Thank you, son. Way to stay heads up.

21:00.187 --> 21:02.264
Occasionally I do something right.

21:02.356 --> 21:03.602
I'm out of here.

21:03.692 --> 21:06.776
- Hurry but drive carefully.
- I'll call you when I get there.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.979
Give me a smooch.

21:09.947 --> 21:12.274
- Bye-bye. Bye, son.
- See you later, Dad.

21:28.591 --> 21:31.628
- The door was locked when you left?
- Yes.

21:31.761 --> 21:33.504
Did you empty the cash register?

21:33.595 --> 21:36.631
Both quarters and all six pennies.
And I shut off the lights.

21:36.723 --> 21:37.720
Just asking.

21:37.808 --> 21:41.391
It's possible I make it through
the entire day without screwing up.

22:06.046 --> 22:07.372
What the...

22:12.634 --> 22:14.793
How the heck did you get in here?

22:26.107 --> 22:29.606
What was it? Halt! Who goes there?

22:30.360 --> 22:34.608
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

22:35.449 --> 22:36.944
Sure you are.

22:38.077 --> 22:40.566
Beware. There will be no mercy.

22:40.703 --> 22:42.197
Is that so?

22:42.539 --> 22:45.031
Beware. There will be no mercy.

22:45.460 --> 22:48.329
I'll be real careful. Thanks for the advice.

22:51.923 --> 22:56.170
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.256
What is your name?

22:58.848 --> 23:02.014
I'm Alan. Now shut up.
I have to do my homework.

23:03.811 --> 23:05.802
Greetings, Alan-now-shut-up.

23:07.106 --> 23:08.516
What did you say?

23:11.068 --> 23:13.025
You just said my name, didn't you?

23:17.409 --> 23:18.651
Didn't you?

24:18.927 --> 24:21.169
Commandos! Ten-hut!

24:23.764 --> 24:25.923
Commando Elite, fall in!

24:40.782 --> 24:42.276
Sound off, soldiers!

24:42.367 --> 24:45.616
Butch Meathook, sniper.
Lethal from any distance, sir!

24:45.745 --> 24:47.121
Good to have you aboard.

24:47.205 --> 24:50.240
Nick Nitro. Demolition is my mission.

24:50.332 --> 24:52.491
I served with your father.
He was a good man.

24:52.585 --> 24:56.085
Brick Bazooka, artillery.
Ready to go full bore, sir!

24:56.172 --> 24:57.452
Save it for the enemy.

24:57.549 --> 25:01.381
Link Static, communications.
Awaiting orders, sir!

25:01.468 --> 25:03.710
Double up on your rations, Sparky.

25:03.804 --> 25:07.885
Kip Killagin, covert insurgent.
Sharp as a razor, sir!

25:08.018 --> 25:10.057
Let me see that weapon.

25:11.895 --> 25:14.221
Standard issue is insufficient.

25:14.315 --> 25:16.805
All right, ladies, now listen good.

25:17.025 --> 25:20.690
Our mission:
Destroy the Gorgonite enemy. Defeat him!

25:20.780 --> 25:22.109
Yes, sir!

25:22.364 --> 25:24.856
There will be no mercy.

25:25.326 --> 25:29.786
Search the area and secure new arms.
Commandos, fall out!

26:45.865 --> 26:47.903
Gorgon.

27:14.434 --> 27:16.177
What the heck are you?

27:20.148 --> 27:22.639
You're not like any toy I've ever seen.

27:24.194 --> 27:26.269
Come on, speak up.

27:27.530 --> 27:33.236
Greetings, Alan-now-shut-up.
I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.

27:34.287 --> 27:36.695
I think you're smarter
than you're letting on.

27:37.123 --> 27:41.998
I bet you're smart enough to get my name
right. It's Alan. Just Alan. Got it?

27:43.545 --> 27:45.207
Greetings, Alan.

27:45.424 --> 27:48.423
I knew it. Walk to the end of the table.

27:51.637 --> 27:53.012
Don't play dumb with me.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.882
You know what I'm saying.

28:08.946 --> 28:10.939
Alan, friend of Archer.

28:11.115 --> 28:14.698
Defender of all Gorgonites.
Keeper of Encarta.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.153
Keeper of Encarta?

28:19.081 --> 28:21.074
You were using my computer?

28:22.085 --> 28:25.085
If I find a virus in there,
you're headed for the microwave.

28:26.089 --> 28:28.759
Beware. There will be no mercy.

28:30.383 --> 28:31.843
Are you threatening me?

28:31.927 --> 28:36.256
The Gorgonites must be free.
There will be no mercy.

28:43.189 --> 28:48.313
Soldiers, no poor sap ever won a war
by dying for his country.

28:48.402 --> 28:51.568
He won it by being all that he can be.

28:52.030 --> 28:55.364
Damn the torpedoes or give me death!

28:55.533 --> 28:58.700
Eternal vigilance is the price of duty.

28:58.787 --> 29:02.785
And to the victors go the spoils.
So, remember...

29:02.875 --> 29:06.659
...you are the best of the best
of the few and the proud!

29:06.795 --> 29:09.204
So, ask not what your country
can do for you...

29:09.297 --> 29:12.464
...only regret that you have
but one life to live.

29:13.135 --> 29:16.135
The war against the Gorgonites
will be won!

29:18.140 --> 29:21.556
Commando Elite, let the first shot be fired!

29:21.643 --> 29:24.846
Search out the Gorgonites
and frag them all!

29:24.939 --> 29:26.729
Attack!

29:27.983 --> 29:29.477
<i>Get him! Jump on him!</i>

29:29.568 --> 29:31.561
<i>Plastic at twelve o'clock!</i>

29:35.824 --> 29:38.493
<i>Archer, where are you, anyway?</i>

29:42.665 --> 29:45.416
I am in so much trouble.

29:46.251 --> 29:48.457
There will be no mercy.

29:51.089 --> 29:52.797
This is what you meant?

29:53.760 --> 29:56.083
How could toys do this?

30:02.141 --> 30:04.300
Alas, poor Troglokhan.

30:04.394 --> 30:08.392
I'm sorry, Archer.
That's all the pieces I could find.

30:09.524 --> 30:12.809
The Commando Elite
have destroyed Troglokhan.

30:13.111 --> 30:16.812
What about the other Gorgonites?
And where are the Commandos?

30:25.165 --> 30:28.415
Hi. We're closed. See the sign?

30:28.626 --> 30:31.544
I'll be quick. I just came for Major Chip
and the monster.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.503
I can't sell you them. Sorry.

30:33.590 --> 30:36.212
But you're the only store that has them.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.961
The toys are gone, all right?

30:38.595 --> 30:40.219
Well, what about him?

30:42.556 --> 30:45.558
Him. He's defective...

30:46.644 --> 30:49.135
...and the rest were stolen.

30:49.272 --> 30:50.932
That's too bad.

30:53.485 --> 30:54.647
Alan...

30:54.777 --> 30:56.437
...we must find the...

30:57.946 --> 30:59.821
Oh, my God.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.153
Who did this?

31:06.915 --> 31:09.203
Are you pulling
some kind of insurance scam?

31:10.418 --> 31:14.913
I swear, I did one thing wrong.
That's it! And I'm branded for life.

31:15.506 --> 31:17.166
So, it is true.

31:18.218 --> 31:22.594
I heard your parents moved here because
you got kicked out of ten different schools.

31:22.722 --> 31:24.001
I did not.

31:24.306 --> 31:25.717
No?

31:32.689 --> 31:33.934
It was two.

31:34.066 --> 31:35.561
Only two.

31:41.658 --> 31:42.820
So...

31:44.160 --> 31:45.819
...you need some help?

31:47.537 --> 31:50.409
- Alan, can I talk now?
- No.

31:53.169 --> 31:55.742
I can't believe they broke my dad's radio.

31:58.216 --> 32:00.670
<i>Do you ever watch that show,
Family of Five?</i>

32:00.759 --> 32:01.956
Sure.

32:02.052 --> 32:03.381
You like it?

32:03.971 --> 32:04.966
It's okay.

32:05.055 --> 32:08.260
Thank God! Me, neither.
I hate it. It's so lame.

32:08.351 --> 32:10.094
I'm sick of hearing it's so great.

32:10.186 --> 32:12.427
I can't stand the parents. They're so nice.

32:12.522 --> 32:16.056
- The worst. Where do these go?
- Over there.

32:18.318 --> 32:21.155
<i>I'm more of an X-Files guy myself.</i>

32:21.530 --> 32:23.688
"The truth is out there," Alan.

32:25.659 --> 32:27.117
You like Led Zeppelin?

32:27.203 --> 32:29.361
Yeah, they're the greatest.

32:30.081 --> 32:31.824
They're my favorite band.

32:33.292 --> 32:36.044
You're not like other girls.

32:36.670 --> 32:38.080
I know.

32:45.637 --> 32:49.303
I can't believe we've finished.
It took less time than I thought.

32:50.142 --> 32:51.968
And the boat looks great.

32:52.184 --> 32:55.103
It wasn't that messed up.
The mast was the hardest part.

32:55.188 --> 32:56.682
He'll never know.

32:58.483 --> 33:00.808
So, what did you do?

33:03.071 --> 33:06.274
Come on, Alan.
I've heard the story ten times already.

33:06.407 --> 33:09.160
Don't deny it. They say
you're a real terror.

33:09.452 --> 33:12.121
Yeah, that's me, a real terror.

33:12.957 --> 33:16.372
I did some graffiti, flooded
the faculty bathroom. Stuff like that.

33:16.586 --> 33:19.419
My shrink told my parents
I was "acting out."

33:20.005 --> 33:22.674
I heard you called a bomb scare
on Parents' Day.

33:22.757 --> 33:24.797
That's when I got caught.

33:24.884 --> 33:26.214
Bummer.

33:26.803 --> 33:28.547
I got put on probation for a while.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.924
But that was a long time ago.
I'm a totally different person now.

33:32.684 --> 33:33.679
Sure.

33:33.852 --> 33:35.180
No, really.

33:35.352 --> 33:36.931
Hey, Alan, how's it going?

33:38.815 --> 33:39.810
Dad.

33:39.899 --> 33:43.482
I was on my way home from the airport.
I thought I'd stop to say hello.

33:44.069 --> 33:46.643
- And check up on me?
- And check up on you.

33:47.073 --> 33:49.908
Of course. That's my job.
Me Dad, you son, right?

33:50.910 --> 33:53.199
- This is Christy.
- Hi.

33:53.288 --> 33:55.447
- From next door.
- Hello.

33:56.374 --> 33:59.044
- Alan, what happened here?
- Nothing.

34:00.128 --> 34:01.787
Nothing happened.

34:03.048 --> 34:04.375
Really?

34:06.885 --> 34:09.126
Then, how do you explain this?

34:09.304 --> 34:11.795
I was dusting it and it fell over.

34:11.889 --> 34:14.641
Dusting with what, a croquet mallet?

34:15.893 --> 34:17.518
I should go.

34:17.603 --> 34:19.844
I almost forgot my stuff.

34:23.734 --> 34:25.476
Bye, Alan.

34:28.782 --> 34:30.774
You go home, too. I'll close up.

34:30.992 --> 34:34.860
- I can do it.
- Obviously you can't. Go home.

34:48.217 --> 34:50.257
I'm really sorry about that.

34:50.344 --> 34:54.257
I have parents, too.
If that's all he sees, you got off lucky.

34:54.766 --> 34:56.924
- Here are your toys.
- Thanks.

34:59.270 --> 35:02.472
What happened? I thought
you were coming by practice today.

35:02.564 --> 35:04.889
Sorry. Something else came up.

35:05.275 --> 35:08.809
I know you. You're the kid
who set his old school on fire, right?

35:09.112 --> 35:11.105
Yeah, just to watch it burn.

35:11.532 --> 35:12.695
Whatever.

35:13.117 --> 35:16.949
We got a scrimmage with the JV.
Come on, you can cheer me on.

35:17.620 --> 35:18.784
Great.

35:25.296 --> 35:26.790
See you later.

35:30.968 --> 35:32.213
Let's see...

35:35.138 --> 35:36.633
What do I need?

35:37.140 --> 35:38.683
Coping saw.

35:46.399 --> 35:48.273
I don't believe it!

35:56.910 --> 35:59.912
- Alan, we must...
- Shut up!

36:00.206 --> 36:02.910
- The Gorgonites...
- You're nothing but trouble.

36:16.138 --> 36:17.965
Link Static to command post.

36:18.056 --> 36:22.054
Have targeted single Gorgonite
with civilian escort.

36:22.519 --> 36:24.843
Approaching your position. Over.

36:25.646 --> 36:28.139
Roger, Private Static. Copy that.

36:29.026 --> 36:31.184
Brick Bazooka, front and center.

36:31.819 --> 36:33.811
Prepare for assault, Sergeant.

36:36.699 --> 36:39.535
Don't fire till you see
the whites of his eyes.

36:40.537 --> 36:42.529
Prepare to fire the bazooka.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.495
Fire!

37:02.266 --> 37:03.726
Gorgonite K9 corps.

37:09.149 --> 37:11.354
Watch it. I'll have your dog tags.

37:14.570 --> 37:16.279
What are you doing here?

37:18.575 --> 37:19.738
Go home.

37:26.624 --> 37:28.782
Coming up.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.788
Hand over hand.

37:34.298 --> 37:36.671
I'm coming for you, Gorgonite.

38:02.827 --> 38:04.486
Damn potholes.

38:05.663 --> 38:07.988
<i>Command post to Brick Bazooka. Report.</i>

38:10.125 --> 38:12.997
<i>Repeat, this is command post. Report.</i>

38:14.005 --> 38:16.673
Brick Bazooka reporting.

38:17.508 --> 38:21.838
Target escaped
en route to enemy stronghold.

38:22.554 --> 38:24.463
I'm pretty messed up, sir.

38:25.015 --> 38:27.851
<i>Hold on, son. We're on our way.</i>

38:29.979 --> 38:31.010
Wrong gauge.

38:31.104 --> 38:33.263
Insert tab A into slot B.

38:33.524 --> 38:35.350
Turn until click.

38:35.693 --> 38:37.981
Bite the bullet, pal. It'll be okay.

38:38.154 --> 38:39.482
Here's the tape.

38:41.741 --> 38:44.408
Go ahead, kid. Let it out.

38:52.168 --> 38:54.658
It's a small world after all.

38:58.675 --> 39:02.008
Hello, Heartland Play Systems.
How may I help you?

39:02.219 --> 39:05.718
Yes, I'm having some trouble
with one of your...

39:05.806 --> 39:08.723
What is the name of the toy
and the nature of the problem?

39:08.976 --> 39:11.265
The toys are the Gorgonites.

39:11.603 --> 39:13.561
There are no more Gorgonites.

39:14.188 --> 39:15.600
And the Commando Elite.

39:15.691 --> 39:18.264
They are the mortal enemies
of the Gorgonites.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.737
<i>And what is the problem?</i>

39:19.820 --> 39:23.236
The Commandos wrecked my dad's store
and destroyed the Gorgonites!

39:23.573 --> 39:26.243
The Commando Elite are designed
to fight the Gorgonites.

39:26.326 --> 39:28.948
No, they destroyed them
and now they're gone!

39:29.245 --> 39:32.579
<i>I'm sorry, but Heartland Play Systems
does not replace lost toys.</i>

39:32.708 --> 39:35.377
I didn't lose them!
Is there a machine I can talk to?

39:35.460 --> 39:37.203
Just transfer me to a machine!

39:38.088 --> 39:39.997
Have a nice day, ma'am.

39:40.089 --> 39:41.465
I'm not a ma'am!

39:42.968 --> 39:46.717
<i>Please state the name of your toy
and nature of your problem.</i>

39:46.805 --> 39:49.509
Your damn Commando Elite
wrecked my dad's store...

39:49.599 --> 39:53.514
...destroyed the super Gorgonites
and ran off! Got it? Lawsuit! Got that?

39:55.814 --> 39:59.811
Alan Abernathy, 330-555-0125.

40:01.403 --> 40:02.980
Destroy Gorgonites.

40:03.154 --> 40:04.150
Shut up!

40:11.288 --> 40:11.952
Alan.

40:12.039 --> 40:13.449
Don't talk to me!

40:16.167 --> 40:17.496
Not a word!

40:26.886 --> 40:29.092
<i>On Monday morning, at 0900 hours...</i>

40:29.180 --> 40:34.387
<i>...250,000 Commandos and 250,000
Gorgonites will fight side by side...</i>

40:34.477 --> 40:37.811
<i>...with children everywhere,
trying to separate mommy and daddy...</i>

40:37.897 --> 40:40.103
<i>...from the money in their wallets.</i>

40:42.734 --> 40:44.063
Larry.

40:46.698 --> 40:48.358
<i>Now, listen to this.</i>

40:48.449 --> 40:52.529
<i>They cover 100 merchandise licensees
for the next two months.</i>

40:52.662 --> 40:55.283
<i>You won't be able to turn on a TV,
board a bus...</i>

40:55.373 --> 40:57.947
<i>...open a lunch box,
or put on your own underwear...</i>

40:58.042 --> 41:01.542
<i>...without seeing the Gorgonites
raging war with the Commando Elite!</i>

41:03.590 --> 41:05.547
<i>What do you think of that, Mr. Mars?</i>

41:07.217 --> 41:08.498
It's a start.

41:10.347 --> 41:11.424
Larry.

41:12.807 --> 41:14.466
<i>Larry, folks.</i>

41:21.440 --> 41:22.768
We have to talk.

41:23.025 --> 41:25.065
We have a big problem. It's urgent.

41:25.152 --> 41:27.358
What are you doing here? Stop it.

41:30.408 --> 41:33.741
<i>Alan Abernathy, 330-555-0...</i>

41:34.871 --> 41:36.578
That's where voice mail cut him off.

41:36.663 --> 41:38.620
- It's not a problem.
- It's not?

41:38.707 --> 41:43.002
These things go on sale Monday.
How did this kid get hold of them?

41:43.129 --> 41:47.126
It's industrial espionage.
I got two words for you: Counter suit.

41:47.508 --> 41:49.915
One word: Countersuit. Two words.

41:50.010 --> 41:52.169
It's two words, Larry!

41:52.763 --> 41:54.756
What if this kid's telling the truth?

41:54.848 --> 41:58.133
We can't have toys out on the market
that may be dangerous.

41:58.310 --> 42:01.227
How can they be dangerous?
Everything on them is standard.

42:01.312 --> 42:04.230
The design is standard,
the materials are standard...

42:04.316 --> 42:06.642
...the mechanicals are standard.
Even the...

42:06.944 --> 42:07.975
Oh.

42:08.487 --> 42:09.686
What's, "Oh"?

42:09.906 --> 42:10.605
What?

42:10.698 --> 42:13.069
- You just said, "Oh."
- No, I said, "Oh."

42:13.158 --> 42:15.910
"Oh" like, "That's interesting"
or like, "We're screwed"?

42:15.994 --> 42:18.237
No. I mean, hey, whoa, oh.

42:19.205 --> 42:22.493
Forget the "Oh". I'll go to legal
to start on the countersuit.

42:22.584 --> 42:24.161
The chips!

42:24.836 --> 42:26.414
That's the "Oh."

42:27.297 --> 42:29.125
These microprocessing chips.

42:29.216 --> 42:32.003
What do they do
and where did you get them from?

42:32.093 --> 42:36.506
They microprocess. And they come from
the land of I Saved Your Job.

42:43.104 --> 42:45.774
They were designed
for the Defense Department.

42:46.526 --> 42:49.359
You put munitions chips in toys?

42:57.661 --> 42:59.571
<i>Archer...</i>

43:01.540 --> 43:04.824
<i>...emissary of the Gorgonites.</i>

43:06.169 --> 43:08.044
<i>Where are you?</i>

43:11.340 --> 43:13.583
<i>Beware. There will be no mercy.</i>

43:16.221 --> 43:19.222
<i>We're lost. We need to find our homeland.</i>

43:19.473 --> 43:20.803
<i>Yeah, our homeland.</i>

43:24.061 --> 43:26.599
<i>We're in trouble. Please find us.</i>

43:27.357 --> 43:29.479
<i>You've got to help us find Goron.</i>

43:29.568 --> 43:30.516
<i>Goron?</i>

43:30.610 --> 43:32.401
<i>It's "Gorgon", moron.</i>

43:36.866 --> 43:41.079
<i>I hope he comes. We're no match
for the awesome Commandos.</i>

43:41.162 --> 43:43.403
<i>Yeah, everything else is just a toy.</i>

43:44.875 --> 43:47.448
<i>Kitty, kitty, kitty.</i>

43:53.341 --> 43:55.582
Grab him! Hold him down!

43:55.843 --> 43:57.587
Get that leg!

44:00.556 --> 44:02.216
String him up!

44:02.934 --> 44:04.892
<i>Tell us what we want to know.</i>

44:08.190 --> 44:11.107
<i>I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.</i>

44:11.234 --> 44:12.396
Archer?

44:13.611 --> 44:16.778
<i>Where are the rest of the Gorgonite scum?</i>

44:17.114 --> 44:19.785
<i>We have ways of making you talk.</i>

44:22.952 --> 44:25.908
<i>Make it easy on yourself.
If you tell us, we'll let you go.</i>

44:25.999 --> 44:28.406
<i>It will go easier for you if you cooperate.</i>

44:29.126 --> 44:31.747
<i>I am Archer, emissary of the Gorgonites.</i>

44:31.838 --> 44:34.837
<i>All right. Let's dispose of this garbage.</i>

44:38.594 --> 44:39.838
It's the kid.

44:39.928 --> 44:43.263
Commandos, pull back!
Retrograde movement!

45:00.324 --> 45:02.696
- Give me that!
- That's mine, punk!

45:04.745 --> 45:07.070
Surrender, Gorgonite ally.

45:08.415 --> 45:10.408
You just met your match.

45:10.793 --> 45:11.873
Oh, yeah?

45:11.961 --> 45:14.877
Surrender or die!

45:16.632 --> 45:18.375
Medic! Medic!

45:22.680 --> 45:23.843
Medic!

45:25.850 --> 45:27.473
Come on out!

45:28.727 --> 45:31.052
Alan, what the hell is going on here?

45:32.689 --> 45:33.555
Medic!

45:33.649 --> 45:35.724
Alan, your hand! What happened?

45:35.943 --> 45:39.395
How did you cut your hand?
And what are you doing down here?

45:40.363 --> 45:43.033
Mom, Dad, it's okay.

45:45.952 --> 45:48.740
While you were gone,
I bought some soldier toys from Joe.

45:48.831 --> 45:51.204
I figured I could sell them
before you got back.

45:51.292 --> 45:54.207
And for once, I would have made
the store a little money.

45:54.294 --> 45:57.130
I know it was the wrong thing to do.
I'm sorry.

45:58.131 --> 45:59.791
There, I said it.

46:02.969 --> 46:04.299
Okay.

46:05.306 --> 46:09.302
I think it's very honest of you
to tell the truth.

46:09.893 --> 46:14.306
So, you pawned my woodworking tools
so you could pay Joe?

46:14.398 --> 46:17.316
No! I'm pretty sure the toys took them.

46:17.568 --> 46:18.598
What?

46:18.944 --> 46:20.188
The toys.

46:21.656 --> 46:24.026
Are you trying to upset me?

46:24.115 --> 46:27.283
I mean, are you deliberately making...

46:27.494 --> 46:30.577
- What was the word? Projected...
- Aggression.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.905
- Projected aggression...
- It's not aggression!

46:32.998 --> 46:36.498
It's these toys!
It's like they're alive. Look.

46:38.671 --> 46:40.830
Come on, Archer. Back me up here.

46:42.842 --> 46:44.171
Say something.

46:45.094 --> 46:47.420
Halt! Who goes there? Talk to me!

46:47.513 --> 46:49.672
Alan, please.

46:50.516 --> 46:53.803
I need to ask you this. Are you on crank?

46:53.979 --> 46:54.808
No!

46:54.896 --> 46:58.726
Then is it crystal meth, tar, smack?
We need to know!

46:58.816 --> 47:01.733
No, I'm not on drugs! It's these soldiers!

47:01.861 --> 47:03.900
All right, that's it! Stop it.

47:04.405 --> 47:06.197
I mean, Alan...

47:06.574 --> 47:07.902
...I am...

47:09.202 --> 47:10.744
...at a loss.

47:14.957 --> 47:17.793
You! Why didn't you say anything?

47:18.045 --> 47:21.579
<i>Shut up! Don't talk to me! Not a word!</i>

47:21.714 --> 47:24.383
Wise guy. I should shred the bunch of you.

47:25.342 --> 47:28.426
My dad thinks I'm insane.
Christy thinks I'm an idiot...

47:28.513 --> 47:32.380
...and when Joe finds out
I can't pay him back, he'll break my legs.

47:32.893 --> 47:35.181
The Gorgonites are not destroyed.

47:36.019 --> 47:36.885
What?

47:37.062 --> 47:42.437
Major Hazard seeks the location of the
Gorgonite scum. They are not destroyed.

47:43.319 --> 47:46.984
'Cause if the Commandos destroyed them
they wouldn't be looking for them.

47:48.741 --> 47:51.232
All right, where are they?

47:51.660 --> 47:55.195
My Gorgonite brothers are doing
what the Gorgonites do best:

47:55.414 --> 47:57.074
They are hiding.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.634
Commando Elite, fall in!

48:07.761 --> 48:09.753
Sir! Yes, sir!

48:11.264 --> 48:14.680
We have met the enemy.
He is big. He is fast.

48:14.767 --> 48:17.683
He has allied himself
with the Gorgonite scum.

48:17.936 --> 48:22.183
The rules of engagement have changed.
Private Static!

48:23.525 --> 48:24.688
Damn!

48:28.863 --> 48:30.855
This place is a gold mine.

48:31.116 --> 48:34.201
Holy smokes. Look at all this hardware.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.612
Technological superiority.

48:37.831 --> 48:39.658
Dibs on the chain saw.

48:47.340 --> 48:48.883
Falling in, sir.

48:53.807 --> 48:54.838
Out of the way.

48:58.518 --> 49:02.847
It's only a flesh wound, sir.

49:03.315 --> 49:06.020
Rest easy. You've done your job.

49:06.819 --> 49:09.143
Did we win?

49:10.822 --> 49:11.985
We will.

49:13.283 --> 49:15.774
Nick Nitro's battery has run out.

49:15.993 --> 49:19.992
But his memory will keep going
and going and going.

49:20.332 --> 49:23.001
His death will be avenged.

49:27.505 --> 49:30.957
Commandos, secure the perimeter!
Tap all communications!

49:31.176 --> 49:34.212
Roll some armor! We got us a war to win.

49:34.304 --> 49:37.304
If it launches, lacerates or detonates...

49:37.431 --> 49:40.005
...I want it mobile and I want it lethal!

49:40.185 --> 49:41.560
Sir! Yes, sir!

49:48.526 --> 49:50.767
They're not in the storeroom,
they're not here.

49:50.861 --> 49:53.353
Monsters shouldn't be hiding
but fighting Commandos.

49:53.447 --> 49:54.776
We would lose.

49:55.033 --> 49:57.523
It is what we were programmed to do.

49:57.619 --> 50:01.118
Hide and lose?
Those are some great options.

50:03.166 --> 50:06.001
If I was a Gorgonite, where would I be?

50:06.210 --> 50:11.287
I'm hiding because I'm a loser.
I've got zero self-esteem...

50:11.634 --> 50:13.709
...and my brain's the size of a peanut.

50:14.801 --> 50:16.379
Where would I be?

50:32.069 --> 50:34.275
This is so gross.

50:34.572 --> 50:36.565
Hello. Is anybody in there?

50:42.621 --> 50:43.701
Ocula.

50:44.249 --> 50:47.415
- What was that?
- It's the Gorgonites.

50:49.587 --> 50:50.916
Ocula.

50:52.091 --> 50:54.841
Punch-it. Scratch-it.

50:55.550 --> 50:58.220
Great to be back.
But seriously, what a dump.

50:58.428 --> 50:59.757
Insaniac.

51:00.807 --> 51:02.135
Are you a kid or oil painting?

51:03.936 --> 51:07.101
Don't worry, Archer. We was hiding.

51:07.604 --> 51:08.933
Slamfist.

51:10.690 --> 51:12.020
Troglokhan?

51:14.278 --> 51:15.441
We fixed him.

51:15.529 --> 51:17.817
We tried to fix him.

51:19.032 --> 51:20.360
My dad's radio.

51:20.492 --> 51:23.529
Some assembly required.

51:24.872 --> 51:29.165
<i>So am I nuts? What's going on here?
Give me a call, 1-800, talk to me.</i>

51:29.293 --> 51:30.456
Freaky.

51:31.628 --> 51:33.122
Like Frankenstein.

51:34.881 --> 51:38.796
At least you're all here.
Maybe Joe won't break my legs after all.

51:39.636 --> 51:41.095
<i>Access approved.</i>

51:41.513 --> 51:43.008
Let me get this straight.

51:43.099 --> 51:47.558
You used my password to order surplus
military chips that might be dangerous?

51:50.898 --> 51:52.558
It's okay.

51:52.649 --> 51:55.816
That's supposed to happen.
See? Clean room.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.988
Clean. Let's just go in.

51:59.990 --> 52:01.152
You okay?

52:02.535 --> 52:04.610
That's him. That's Ralph.

52:07.122 --> 52:08.996
Who are you? You don't belong here.

52:09.083 --> 52:12.451
I'm Larry Benson. You supplied
my division with some microchips.

52:12.545 --> 52:15.213
Yes. Larry Benson.

52:16.005 --> 52:21.000
The X1000. Worked out better
than you dreamed, didn't they?

52:21.721 --> 52:24.127
Actually, there was a little problem.

52:25.307 --> 52:27.264
Then it's with your software.

52:27.684 --> 52:31.266
I don't think there's a problem
with the software, Ralph.

52:31.772 --> 52:32.887
You don't?

52:34.024 --> 52:37.144
The X1000 is a masterpiece.

52:38.445 --> 52:40.484
Imagine a microchip...

52:40.572 --> 52:44.783
...sophisticated enough to control
the guidance systems of ballistic missiles.

52:44.867 --> 52:48.996
Imagine it can be used to instantly upgrade
any system it's plugged into.

52:49.373 --> 52:54.367
Like a smart drug for machines.
Then, imagine it can learn.

52:55.044 --> 52:58.081
What are you talking about?
Artificial intelligence?

52:58.214 --> 53:00.207
No. Actual intelligence.

53:00.676 --> 53:03.877
No wonder those philistines
at the Pentagon didn't appreciate it.

53:03.969 --> 53:06.425
One flaw and they scrap the whole project.

53:07.266 --> 53:09.637
So there is a flaw in the chips.

53:11.645 --> 53:14.266
They're a little bit sensitive to EMP.

53:14.397 --> 53:17.600
EMP? Electromagnetic pulse?

53:17.733 --> 53:21.482
The kind generated
by the detonation of a nuclear device.

53:21.571 --> 53:24.940
I doubt even the toy industry has become
quite that competitive.

53:25.324 --> 53:29.653
They said, "Adequate shielding
wasn't cost effective."

53:31.331 --> 53:33.239
Did the Medici ever tell Michelangelo:

53:33.333 --> 53:37.793
"Sorry, Mike, marble's not cost-effective.
Here's a bag of cement"? I think not!

53:39.464 --> 53:40.627
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

53:41.091 --> 53:42.253
Thank you.

53:42.425 --> 53:45.628
There shouldn't be any problem,
just because the chips can learn.

53:45.844 --> 53:50.673
Am I not being clear? They learn within
the boundaries of their programming.

53:50.767 --> 53:54.350
Whatever the core programming,
the X1000 enhances it.

53:55.729 --> 53:58.564
So, if you have a problem,
it's in your software.

54:03.488 --> 54:06.655
Quick impression, Jimmy Cagney.
"Top of the world, Ma."

54:10.077 --> 54:12.236
Talk about hampering your career.

54:12.955 --> 54:14.153
Grab him!

54:14.791 --> 54:17.460
It looks so real, don't it?

54:18.795 --> 54:20.123
Hit him.

54:22.214 --> 54:23.792
Friend of yours?

54:30.639 --> 54:32.882
What am I going to do with you guys?

54:34.142 --> 54:36.930
Two hundred and twenty-one.
Two hundred and twenty-two.

54:37.981 --> 54:39.771
There goes the record.

54:44.319 --> 54:47.936
Not so close. You'll ruin your eye.

54:56.916 --> 54:57.996
What are you looking at?

54:58.834 --> 55:00.162
I dunno.

55:05.298 --> 55:06.793
<i>- Hello?
- Alan?</i>

55:07.135 --> 55:07.915
Christy?

55:08.928 --> 55:10.505
Are you grounded?

55:10.596 --> 55:12.754
<i>No, my dad cooled off.</i>

55:13.140 --> 55:14.170
So, we did it.

55:14.516 --> 55:18.513
Yeah, and the best part is,
I found all those lost toys.

55:19.188 --> 55:20.516
You were really a big help.

55:21.105 --> 55:22.435
Cool.

55:24.486 --> 55:26.109
So, Alan, boxers or briefs?

55:26.194 --> 55:27.902
Get those off your head.

55:28.197 --> 55:29.856
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

55:30.866 --> 55:32.028
Nothing.

55:33.534 --> 55:36.620
Listen, I was thinking maybe
we should celebrate sometime.

55:36.705 --> 55:38.863
Go to a movie or something.

55:39.123 --> 55:43.620
Alan, I only date older guys.
It's nothing personal.

55:46.465 --> 55:49.880
<i>What I mean is,
officially I'm going out with Brad.</i>

55:49.969 --> 55:53.633
What about unofficially? Or superficially?

55:54.305 --> 55:59.300
<i>There is one guy. But he's kind of
a smart aleck and a bit of a troublemaker.</i>

56:01.021 --> 56:04.022
<i>I'm sure he'd be willing
to give it all up for you.</i>

56:04.399 --> 56:06.225
<i>I know I would.</i>

56:07.069 --> 56:08.229
<i>Alan.</i>

56:16.788 --> 56:18.494
It's party time!

56:26.671 --> 56:28.498
One phat ride!

56:32.093 --> 56:37.218
Transmission intercepted. The Gorgonites
are bivouacked at the enemy stronghold.

56:37.348 --> 56:40.468
And the enemy has revealed
an age-old weakness.

56:40.561 --> 56:44.344
<i>I'm sure he'd be willing to give it all up
for you. I know I would.</i>

56:44.438 --> 56:46.645
Put yourself in for a commendation.

56:47.900 --> 56:50.392
Soldiers! We have
a window of opportunity.

56:50.486 --> 56:54.069
We will exploit it, drown the enemy out
and crush the Gorgonites!

56:54.615 --> 56:59.277
We must go behind enemy lines
to secure a hostage. Prepare to move out.

56:59.871 --> 57:01.745
Hop it, jarheads!

57:05.626 --> 57:08.960
I guess you guys are safe
as long as you stay here.

57:12.340 --> 57:13.716
What are you looking for?

57:13.800 --> 57:14.964
Gorgon.

57:16.179 --> 57:18.136
This is a national park.

57:18.222 --> 57:21.224
The Isle of Gorgon is our homeland.

57:21.476 --> 57:23.633
Will you help us find it?

57:24.143 --> 57:26.386
I don't think you will find it in there.

57:26.480 --> 57:27.559
Alan...

57:27.815 --> 57:31.647
...if Gorgon is not in that window,
is it in this one?

57:34.447 --> 57:36.522
There's nothing in windows.

57:36.741 --> 57:39.906
There's stuff outside them.

57:40.494 --> 57:41.656
What stuff?

57:41.912 --> 57:43.372
You know, outside.

57:43.497 --> 57:45.823
Trees, power poles...

57:47.251 --> 57:48.912
...Christy's house.

57:49.169 --> 57:50.829
And beyond that?

57:52.006 --> 57:53.547
The mall.

57:54.007 --> 57:55.668
And beyond that?

57:55.843 --> 57:57.171
The highway.

57:57.803 --> 57:59.131
And beyond that?

58:00.014 --> 58:02.171
About a million acres of farm.

58:03.100 --> 58:04.808
And what's beyond that?

58:07.020 --> 58:08.349
I don't know.

58:11.443 --> 58:12.853
Gorgon.

58:15.820 --> 58:19.271
Live, via satellite, 257 channels.

58:19.366 --> 58:21.655
Closed captioning
for the hearing impaired...

58:21.744 --> 58:26.240
...and Dolby stereo where available,
which is right here, right now!

58:27.875 --> 58:31.208
What a great picture. It's perfect.

58:31.503 --> 58:34.207
I don't know. It looks kind of fuzzy.

58:36.467 --> 58:38.258
Let me try something else.

58:40.680 --> 58:42.671
Oh, for pete's sake! Phil!

58:45.809 --> 58:48.347
Maybe if I tweak the brightness a little.

58:48.562 --> 58:52.394
No, it's the chroma.
The flesh tone's way off.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.728
Now it's green.

58:55.860 --> 58:57.189
Stand down, men.

58:57.820 --> 59:00.027
We must neutralize these civilians.

59:00.115 --> 59:01.823
I paid a lot. I don't want any ghosts.

59:14.797 --> 59:15.911
Follow me.

59:20.218 --> 59:21.676
It's a trap, sir.

59:23.138 --> 59:24.217
Bring it here, soldier.

59:26.515 --> 59:27.925
Chemical warfare.

59:29.269 --> 59:31.060
Operation Sandman.

59:37.193 --> 59:39.020
Fire when ready, Private.

59:43.616 --> 59:46.783
Audie Murphy.
Our most decorated war hero.

59:52.082 --> 59:54.573
I think World War II was my favorite war.

01:00:00.049 --> 01:00:02.883
No sign of the target, sir. Area is secured.

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:04.919
Don't worry. She'll be here.

01:00:15.022 --> 01:00:16.814
This is where we'll engage the target.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.817
Set up concealed positions
and prepare for ambush.

01:00:20.236 --> 01:00:21.481
Oh, man.

01:00:21.947 --> 01:00:24.484
I can't believe they got me the whole set.

01:00:25.158 --> 01:00:26.782
Hold your fire, men.

01:00:26.866 --> 01:00:30.450
Cool, you can talk.
You must be the leader.

01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:34.707
Except one day, you get shot.

01:00:38.379 --> 01:00:41.380
And this guy gets promoted...

01:00:41.715 --> 01:00:44.384
...and now he's the leader. Yes!

01:00:44.593 --> 01:00:46.253
It wasn't my idea, Major.

01:00:46.386 --> 01:00:48.047
Commandos, attack!

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.091
Pile on the kid!

01:00:58.983 --> 01:01:02.934
Son, you can be a prisoner or a casualty.
It's up to you.

01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:04.688
Sir, over here.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.654
Oh, man, I hate babysitting.

01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:09.908
- What is it, soldier?
- Take a look, sir.

01:01:12.371 --> 01:01:14.660
Bombshells, sir.

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:19.328
Fully posable.

01:01:22.005 --> 01:01:24.331
Hello, dolly!

01:01:27.344 --> 01:01:29.172
Sweet stuff!

01:01:29.513 --> 01:01:30.923
Hubba-hubba.

01:01:32.557 --> 01:01:33.756
R and R, sir?

01:01:33.851 --> 01:01:35.974
Request a 3-day pass, sir.

01:01:36.102 --> 01:01:41.097
Denied. Gentlemen, this is the new army.
Those are reinforcements.

01:01:41.608 --> 01:01:44.941
Bring me the head of Nick Nitro. Move.

01:01:53.204 --> 01:01:55.873
Soldier, your memory will live on.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:00.538
Damn!

01:02:01.003 --> 01:02:01.999
Criminy!

01:02:02.253 --> 01:02:04.081
I think I'm gonna hurl.

01:02:07.008 --> 01:02:09.250
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

01:03:06.818 --> 01:03:09.487
It's alive! It's alive!

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:17.069
Hi, there. Cannon Fodder Gwendy,
reporting for duty, sir.

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:19.697
Carry on, soldier.

01:03:24.294 --> 01:03:26.583
I feel your pain.

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:49.855
Alan...

01:03:50.903 --> 01:03:53.110
...the Commando Elite are in the trees.

01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:56.319
They're not moving
because of the Commandos.

01:03:56.409 --> 01:03:57.902
It's the wind.

01:03:58.745 --> 01:03:59.823
See?

01:04:00.162 --> 01:04:01.988
I see your hand.

01:04:02.289 --> 01:04:05.291
The wind is blowing. You can feel it.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:07.158
Feel?

01:04:07.628 --> 01:04:11.127
Right. Plastic. Sorry.

01:04:12.299 --> 01:04:15.134
It's kind of hard to describe.

01:04:15.469 --> 01:04:18.174
Weather patterns, wind chill factor.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:22.641
Just because you can't see it,
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.092
See?

01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:30.305
Wind.

01:04:34.821 --> 01:04:36.730
Mom? Dad? I'm home.

01:04:39.201 --> 01:04:40.481
They're asleep.

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:44.036
- You know what that means?
- They could wake up any second.

01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:47.322
You know, you are such a major hottie.

01:04:48.167 --> 01:04:50.838
And you are such a major sweet talker.

01:04:51.297 --> 01:04:52.577
Good night.

01:05:10.065 --> 01:05:14.312
My bike won't start. I got nowhere to go.
Can I come in?

01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:16.820
No, that's not it.

01:05:46.268 --> 01:05:48.936
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.

01:05:56.111 --> 01:05:57.818
Let's do something fun.

01:05:58.113 --> 01:05:59.737
We'll all get facials.

01:06:00.115 --> 01:06:02.273
Did I overpluck my eyebrows?

01:06:30.478 --> 01:06:32.803
Now it's our turn to play with you.

01:06:35.149 --> 01:06:36.941
Let's see if her head comes off.

01:06:42.823 --> 01:06:43.902
Christy?

01:06:54.336 --> 01:06:56.825
Look. A man. Alley-oop.

01:06:57.838 --> 01:07:00.329
Such nice broad shoulders.
Do you work out?

01:07:00.967 --> 01:07:02.758
What's your sign, big boy?

01:07:03.343 --> 01:07:05.634
Makeovers are such a blast.

01:07:06.931 --> 01:07:09.682
That haircut is so five minutes ago.

01:07:09.767 --> 01:07:11.426
Are you dumping me?

01:07:13.437 --> 01:07:14.434
Get off!

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:17.441
You! Maggot!

01:07:17.942 --> 01:07:20.860
An officer and a gentleman
does not strike a lady.

01:07:43.384 --> 01:07:44.962
Are you scared?

01:07:45.218 --> 01:07:47.213
We're all scared.

01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:51.765
You'd have to be crazy not to be scared.

01:07:58.232 --> 01:07:59.431
What?

01:08:01.568 --> 01:08:02.896
What do you see?

01:08:06.157 --> 01:08:08.314
Ocula? Are you all right?

01:08:09.367 --> 01:08:11.324
Settle down. You'll be okay.

01:08:20.545 --> 01:08:22.252
"Surrender?"

01:08:24.591 --> 01:08:25.541
<i>Smile, girlie.</i>

01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:28.469
<i>"Alan, I'm safe. I have not been harmed."</i>

01:08:29.261 --> 01:08:30.127
Christy?

01:08:30.221 --> 01:08:34.089
<i>"I am making this statement of my
own free will and under no duress."</i>

01:08:34.184 --> 01:08:37.220
<i>- Yeah, right.
- Stick to the script. Read it as we wrote it.</i>

01:08:37.938 --> 01:08:39.349
<i>Make it snappy.</i>

01:08:39.441 --> 01:08:42.107
<i>"I will be released safely and unharmed...</i>

01:08:42.274 --> 01:08:44.944
<i>"...only if the following conditions are met:</i>

01:08:45.362 --> 01:08:48.031
<i>"One: Surrender the Gorgonite scum."</i>

01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:50.731
<i>That's it.</i>

01:08:50.825 --> 01:08:52.285
<i>Faster, or we stick you.</i>

01:08:52.368 --> 01:08:54.194
<i>Alan, you have to help.</i>

01:08:54.453 --> 01:08:56.411
<i>Zoom in. Get those tears.</i>

01:08:56.955 --> 01:08:58.285
What else is on?

01:09:04.212 --> 01:09:08.292
If Major Chip Hazard wants a war,
we'll give him a war.

01:09:10.303 --> 01:09:11.584
<i>Please, Alan, don't do this.</i>

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.803
<i>- We're afraid.
- We're your friends.</i>

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.264
<i>- Have mercy.
- You are a traitor.</i>

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.758
<i>Hi. Welcome to the big cardboard box.</i>

01:09:20.062 --> 01:09:22.600
<i>We'll never see Gorgon again.</i>

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:25.810
<i>- Alan seemed so nice.
- Why would he do this to us?</i>

01:09:25.901 --> 01:09:28.109
<i>Three words, folks. Pu-ber-ty.</i>

01:09:33.243 --> 01:09:37.404
Enemy contact.
Advance with caution. Roll!

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:39.327
Sorry, sir.

01:09:39.832 --> 01:09:43.497
<i>How could you betray us? We're free.</i>

01:09:44.921 --> 01:09:47.921
<i>- Have mercy.
- The Commandos will kill us.</i>

01:09:48.131 --> 01:09:52.462
Gentlemen, it looks like they blinked.
Advance and envelop.

01:09:52.679 --> 01:09:53.923
Sir! Yes, sir!

01:09:54.139 --> 01:09:57.306
<i>Alan, I'm feeling very insecure.</i>

01:09:57.849 --> 01:10:00.257
<i>I'm allergic to cardboard. Pass it on.</i>

01:10:10.113 --> 01:10:11.771
Are you ready, Archer?

01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:15.989
Alan, are you sure this is a good idea?

01:10:31.133 --> 01:10:32.296
<i>You traitor.</i>

01:10:32.426 --> 01:10:35.463
<i>- We must be free.
- I don't feel well.</i>

01:10:35.554 --> 01:10:38.389
<i>Alan, don't do it. You'll be guilt-ridden.</i>

01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:07.292
<i>My aunt was buried alive.
I'm very claustrophobic.</i>

01:11:07.461 --> 01:11:08.956
Rock and roll!

01:11:09.922 --> 01:11:11.748
I love this job!

01:11:18.639 --> 01:11:20.133
Are you all right?

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:27.596
All my make-up is cruelty-free.

01:11:29.775 --> 01:11:31.268
You come here often?

01:11:31.442 --> 01:11:34.113
Will you take me to the prom?

01:11:37.283 --> 01:11:40.282
If you can't accessorize, pulverize.

01:11:48.501 --> 01:11:50.162
You've been a bad boy.

01:11:50.463 --> 01:11:53.463
Now you must be punished.

01:11:56.676 --> 01:11:58.634
Watch out, girls. Hissy fit.

01:12:00.888 --> 01:12:02.466
You're to die for.

01:12:03.017 --> 01:12:05.590
Run! She's got a baton!

01:12:06.812 --> 01:12:08.970
It's a baton death march.

01:12:09.898 --> 01:12:11.975
She's gone postal!

01:12:17.989 --> 01:12:20.066
Oh, I broke a nail.

01:12:20.283 --> 01:12:22.275
I've always hated these things!

01:12:22.535 --> 01:12:23.946
The humanity!

01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:26.949
This is it, men.

01:12:42.305 --> 01:12:46.137
Commandos, the enemy has deployed
a decoy target.

01:12:46.227 --> 01:12:48.763
Return to primary positions.

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:51.430
This is fun!

01:12:55.818 --> 01:12:57.479
You're killing me!

01:13:02.491 --> 01:13:04.318
You rescued me.

01:13:07.079 --> 01:13:08.111
Anytime.

01:13:10.793 --> 01:13:12.370
Let's go get those creeps.

01:13:15.963 --> 01:13:17.789
We have to wake my parents.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.961
Open fire!

01:13:25.473 --> 01:13:29.305
We have the enemy on the run.
Exploit and pursue.

01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:40.356
- You've done this before.
- Once or twice.

01:13:49.413 --> 01:13:50.658
Watch it.

01:13:51.415 --> 01:13:52.660
You watch it.

01:13:57.504 --> 01:13:58.963
We got to get help.

01:14:06.429 --> 01:14:08.637
Anyone got a garage door opener?

01:14:21.361 --> 01:14:23.270
Commandos, attack!

01:14:38.712 --> 01:14:40.290
Time to plant the corn.

01:14:44.342 --> 01:14:47.177
Expect no mercy, Gorgonite ally!

01:14:53.601 --> 01:14:55.061
I'll get the bike.

01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:13.569
Get on! Hurry!

01:15:26.634 --> 01:15:28.461
Hot pursuit!

01:16:01.879 --> 01:16:02.994
Interlock!

01:16:05.298 --> 01:16:07.669
Right side, lock! Left side, lock!

01:16:10.679 --> 01:16:12.173
Ramming speed!

01:16:28.279 --> 01:16:29.772
Hold on!

01:16:54.056 --> 01:16:55.549
They're toast.

01:17:02.062 --> 01:17:04.019
You think I could drive home?

01:17:04.148 --> 01:17:05.642
Good idea.

01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:25.539
- Your kid kidnapped my daughter...
- Uh, oh.

01:17:25.627 --> 01:17:29.790
...tied up my son and drugged me
and my wife. Marion is still tripping!

01:17:29.923 --> 01:17:31.749
Time to hide again.

01:17:32.134 --> 01:17:34.459
Not to mention the damage to my house.

01:18:01.205 --> 01:18:02.912
We have lost the battle.

01:18:03.122 --> 01:18:05.793
We will not lose the war.

01:18:06.458 --> 01:18:07.622
That's the last of them.

01:18:12.466 --> 01:18:16.546
I think that's all of Friday's delivery.
Why did they want it back?

01:18:16.637 --> 01:18:18.878
You know the clowns
that make these decisions.

01:18:18.972 --> 01:18:22.886
They don't care we're standing around
freezing, in the middle of the night...

01:18:22.977 --> 01:18:25.218
...as long as everyone knows
who's in charge.

01:18:34.737 --> 01:18:36.232
Corporations.

01:18:37.156 --> 01:18:40.240
Right hand doesn't know
what the left hand is screwing up.

01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:44.411
Greetings. You've been drafted.

01:18:45.124 --> 01:18:45.869
Move!

01:18:46.374 --> 01:18:48.616
Is this entire household insane?

01:18:49.169 --> 01:18:52.502
He says that toy is alive
just because it moves a little.

01:18:52.714 --> 01:18:56.378
What's next? The Blue Fairy
drops by with a talking cricket?

01:18:56.758 --> 01:18:58.253
He's telling the truth!

01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:01.344
He's brainwashed you, hasn't he?

01:19:01.932 --> 01:19:06.760
Don't worry, honey. We'll get you
the best deprogrammer money can buy.

01:19:06.936 --> 01:19:09.771
You can't change programming.

01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:13.025
Look. Another one.

01:19:13.526 --> 01:19:17.275
I told you they were hiding.
It's what they do.

01:19:18.239 --> 01:19:20.729
That's it. Come on, Christy.

01:19:20.866 --> 01:19:22.906
Timmy, Marion, we're out of here.

01:19:24.286 --> 01:19:26.078
Don't be a stranger, Phil.

01:19:28.874 --> 01:19:34.081
Yes, we're with Heartland Play Systems,
Consumer Satisfaction.

01:19:34.255 --> 01:19:36.627
Is Alan Abernathy here?

01:19:36.715 --> 01:19:38.543
That's Alan, right there.

01:19:39.094 --> 01:19:42.628
How you doing? We understand
you acquired some of our fine products.

01:19:43.432 --> 01:19:45.837
There's a chance they might be...

01:19:47.059 --> 01:19:48.055
...defective.

01:19:48.144 --> 01:19:50.765
But there's no reason to think
they could do any harm.

01:19:50.855 --> 01:19:54.355
- There's reasons.
- There is a problem with the Commandos.

01:19:54.442 --> 01:19:59.352
What problem? Bear in mind, you will be
called into court to support your claim.

01:20:00.822 --> 01:20:03.396
- Your toys nearly killed my son!
- Stuart...

01:20:03.492 --> 01:20:06.327
Don't say calm down!
Calm was killing me.

01:20:06.704 --> 01:20:09.790
And you! You owe my son an apology!

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:14.083
Hey, Larry. Look. It's Archer.

01:20:15.254 --> 01:20:16.334
Greetings.

01:20:16.422 --> 01:20:19.791
I am Archer. Who are you?

01:20:20.175 --> 01:20:22.846
I'm Irwin. I designed you...

01:20:23.095 --> 01:20:24.589
...and all the Gorgonites.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.090
He's the creator.

01:20:30.936 --> 01:20:32.596
You're all here.

01:20:32.814 --> 01:20:34.770
Everyone has to be somewhere.

01:20:35.023 --> 01:20:37.348
That's true. My mom used to...

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:42.775
Making declarative statements?
Formulating inquiries?

01:20:46.035 --> 01:20:47.908
Lights out.

01:20:50.622 --> 01:20:53.114
Something's going on out there.

01:20:57.546 --> 01:21:01.211
That's weird.
There's a Heartland truck outside.

01:21:14.396 --> 01:21:16.721
- More Commandos?
- A lot more.

01:21:18.275 --> 01:21:21.027
Dad, come see this for yourself.

01:21:21.487 --> 01:21:22.815
Chip?

01:21:24.197 --> 01:21:26.189
Dead Chip? The Chip we killed?

01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:28.692
Maybe we didn't kill him enough.

01:21:29.744 --> 01:21:31.404
Oh, my.

01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:36.536
<i>Commandos, fall out!</i>

01:21:36.918 --> 01:21:40.917
<i>Secure the left perimeter!
Secure the right perimeter! Move out!</i>

01:21:41.507 --> 01:21:42.751
Sir, yes, sir!

01:21:42.924 --> 01:21:45.000
<i>Assault formation. Go!</i>

01:21:49.013 --> 01:21:51.684
<i>If war is hell, let's give them hell.</i>

01:21:51.768 --> 01:21:55.431
<i>We didn't start this war,
but we're damn sure going to end it.</i>

01:21:56.729 --> 01:21:58.556
I'm scared.

01:21:59.942 --> 01:22:02.776
It'll be all right. They're not after you.

01:22:03.235 --> 01:22:05.906
They just want to kill
the little monster people.

01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:09.820
That's right. We're just caught up
in some stupid game.

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:12.651
Well, game over.

01:22:13.538 --> 01:22:15.198
Mr. Fimple, wait.

01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:16.494
No, Alan.

01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:18.452
Let him go.

01:22:23.465 --> 01:22:24.792
Archer.

01:22:25.049 --> 01:22:27.801
The Gorgonites must lose.

01:22:32.099 --> 01:22:33.427
Hi!

01:22:34.267 --> 01:22:35.926
I'm Phil Fimple.

01:22:36.936 --> 01:22:40.601
I'm here to negotiate the surrender of the...

01:22:40.982 --> 01:22:42.310
...Gorgonzolas.

01:22:42.525 --> 01:22:45.016
Here's our proposal: Take them!

01:22:45.153 --> 01:22:47.904
He's selling us out.
He's an Arnold Benedict.

01:22:48.406 --> 01:22:52.190
Take them apart, steal their batteries,
whatever it is you...

01:22:52.451 --> 01:22:54.112
...people do.

01:22:59.416 --> 01:23:01.574
Is that my JVC?

01:23:03.588 --> 01:23:05.248
<i>There will be no surrender!</i>

01:23:05.339 --> 01:23:09.253
<i>There will be no mercy!
All Gorgonite scum must die!</i>

01:23:10.553 --> 01:23:12.676
Bomb them all the way back to preschool.

01:23:12.763 --> 01:23:15.598
Recon estimates
Gorgonite scum strength at 16!

01:23:16.267 --> 01:23:19.101
Sixteen? Where did they get sixteen from?

01:23:19.436 --> 01:23:22.272
Seven Gorgonites and nine people.

01:23:24.317 --> 01:23:26.273
Well, you heard our proposal.

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:28.227
Phil, get in here! Hurry!

01:23:28.695 --> 01:23:31.365
<i>These negotiations are over!</i>

01:23:37.038 --> 01:23:39.706
<i>We are the Commando Elite.
Everything else...</i>

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.618
<i>...is just a toy.</i>

01:23:49.341 --> 01:23:52.674
- What are they doing?
- Psychological warfare.

01:23:53.137 --> 01:23:55.710
The Marines did this against Noriega.

01:23:57.307 --> 01:23:58.636
Phil.

01:24:00.978 --> 01:24:03.137
I love this song!

01:24:06.524 --> 01:24:09.194
Fimple, turn that off!

01:24:12.739 --> 01:24:14.947
Go, go!

01:24:19.579 --> 01:24:21.406
Lock and load.

01:24:22.623 --> 01:24:23.952
Nail them!

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.203
Open fire!

01:24:27.003 --> 01:24:28.083
Get down!

01:24:38.725 --> 01:24:40.052
Fimple.

01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:45.015
Honey?

01:24:46.732 --> 01:24:49.936
Stuart, Phil, barricade that window!
Alan, get back.

01:24:51.862 --> 01:24:53.522
Get back!

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:00.987
Fire!

01:25:04.874 --> 01:25:05.953
Wow.

01:25:06.084 --> 01:25:07.412
Fire!

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:09.330
How are they...

01:25:10.297 --> 01:25:14.210
Alan, put out the fires.
Nerds, side windows.

01:25:21.849 --> 01:25:23.510
Marion, Timmy...

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.428
...the closet. Come on, come on. Hurry!

01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:32.932
Just get in. Get down.

01:25:34.905 --> 01:25:36.564
I have that coat.

01:25:36.822 --> 01:25:37.688
Yes.

01:25:39.492 --> 01:25:40.736
Frag 'em all!

01:25:44.538 --> 01:25:45.784
I'll call the police!

01:25:45.873 --> 01:25:48.544
Phil, Christy, push this back. Careful.

01:25:51.086 --> 01:25:51.952
Fire!

01:25:55.299 --> 01:25:56.331
Service.

01:25:58.177 --> 01:25:59.921
Great balls of fire!

01:26:01.599 --> 01:26:04.265
The phone's dead. Nice forehand, honey.

01:26:05.935 --> 01:26:06.847
Incoming!

01:26:07.478 --> 01:26:08.557
I'm hit!

01:26:10.232 --> 01:26:11.726
More shells!

01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:13.395
Take the house!

01:26:13.985 --> 01:26:16.736
We have to stop them
before my wife gets tennis elbow.

01:26:17.029 --> 01:26:20.564
An electromagnetic pulse would work.
That would fry the chips.

01:26:24.495 --> 01:26:26.986
All we need now is a nuclear warhead.

01:26:27.373 --> 01:26:29.615
I doubt I'll have one in the junk drawer.

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:31.500
Nuclear warhead?

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:35.880
The chips aren't shielded against an EMP.
A nuclear blast would wipe them out.

01:26:36.089 --> 01:26:38.249
That's why the military never used them.

01:26:38.342 --> 01:26:41.343
What kind of moron would put
military technology in toys?

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:43.218
That would be Gizmo over here.

01:26:47.433 --> 01:26:51.433
Actually, any electrical device generates
a magnetic field, just not a big one.

01:26:51.897 --> 01:26:53.725
We'll need a big one.

01:26:56.401 --> 01:26:57.980
Fire in the hole!

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:09.278
Alan, the window.

01:27:10.749 --> 01:27:14.914
"I don't know but I've been told
Gorgonite blood runs mighty cold."

01:27:15.505 --> 01:27:17.164
No, Alan.

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:22.627
Way to stay heads up.

01:27:25.013 --> 01:27:27.718
Continue artillery barrage!

01:27:27.808 --> 01:27:29.468
Take cover! Stay low!

01:27:30.185 --> 01:27:33.305
There's a power pole back there
with two huge transformers.

01:27:33.397 --> 01:27:36.351
Could we use those to create
the electromagnetic whatever?

01:27:36.524 --> 01:27:38.516
We could get them to explode.

01:27:38.777 --> 01:27:40.603
That would fry their chips, for sure.

01:27:42.238 --> 01:27:44.196
You could connect the transformers.

01:27:44.282 --> 01:27:47.733
We just need to put something metal
between them.

01:27:47.827 --> 01:27:51.872
You get a nice power boost.
Right up until they overload and blow up.

01:27:52.457 --> 01:27:53.655
It only happened once!

01:27:58.965 --> 01:28:00.079
That's it.

01:28:07.139 --> 01:28:08.550
This should work.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.094
Forget it. You're not going out there.

01:28:17.190 --> 01:28:19.349
- There's no time!
- It's too dangerous.

01:28:19.443 --> 01:28:20.901
We've only got one chance!

01:28:21.068 --> 01:28:22.861
You are my responsibility and...

01:28:23.405 --> 01:28:26.238
Dad, there's no other way!

01:28:35.417 --> 01:28:37.409
You have to trust me.

01:28:37.878 --> 01:28:38.791
Wait.

01:28:40.797 --> 01:28:42.256
It's dark in here.

01:28:42.382 --> 01:28:43.876
It's night, genius.

01:28:43.967 --> 01:28:48.794
I mean, power has to be going through
the transformers for them to overload.

01:28:51.558 --> 01:28:54.973
The power's on at my house
and we've tons of crap to turn on.

01:28:55.061 --> 01:28:59.723
We have to wedge the breakers
open in your fuse box. Come on, Larry.

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:01.560
I hate you, Irwin.

01:29:05.738 --> 01:29:08.229
We have met the enemy and he is you!

01:29:15.206 --> 01:29:18.041
I love the smell of polyurethane
in the morning.

01:29:22.546 --> 01:29:25.038
Oh, my God. Phil, in here, in here.

01:29:26.592 --> 01:29:27.922
It's locked.

01:29:32.389 --> 01:29:33.588
Up, up, up.

01:29:35.518 --> 01:29:36.928
Balcony's closed.

01:29:37.394 --> 01:29:38.676
Down, down, down.

01:29:38.813 --> 01:29:40.890
Descend and destroy.

01:29:45.194 --> 01:29:48.776
Let me in. Damn it! Fimple, you freak!
Let me in!

01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:53.991
All quiet on the Western front yard!

01:29:55.329 --> 01:29:58.661
Go and turn on every piece
of electronic equipment in your house.

01:29:58.749 --> 01:30:01.418
This one's for Nick Nitro!

01:30:06.215 --> 01:30:08.124
Mess around with my kid, huh?

01:30:08.217 --> 01:30:10.707
A broomstick. I'm scared.

01:30:10.803 --> 01:30:11.965
Get him!

01:30:12.429 --> 01:30:13.461
First blood!

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.882
Stick this in your pipe and smoke it!

01:30:23.065 --> 01:30:24.393
All right, Dad!

01:30:26.151 --> 01:30:27.645
We roasted them!

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.812
There they are. Nail 'em!

01:30:32.492 --> 01:30:33.653
Not good.

01:30:34.159 --> 01:30:37.161
Hey, kid! Don't you like 9-inch nails?

01:30:40.164 --> 01:30:41.991
I got hit. I'm okay.

01:30:44.837 --> 01:30:47.838
Gorgonites, we must help Alan.

01:30:48.507 --> 01:30:51.507
But if we fight, we will lose.

01:30:51.885 --> 01:30:54.555
Last time we fought,
I woke up with AM/FM.

01:30:54.639 --> 01:30:56.631
War is nuts.
I know what I'm talking about.

01:30:56.723 --> 01:30:59.215
We shouldn't fight. We should hide.

01:30:59.809 --> 01:31:02.645
If we hide, we will still lose.

01:31:03.146 --> 01:31:05.305
No more hiding.

01:31:06.482 --> 01:31:08.060
Nail them to the wall!

01:31:12.571 --> 01:31:13.984
Gorgonites, fight!

01:31:20.206 --> 01:31:23.371
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

01:31:31.341 --> 01:31:32.253
Strike!

01:31:32.342 --> 01:31:34.168
Retreat!

01:31:37.097 --> 01:31:39.385
Meet my wife, the old ball and chain.

01:31:39.474 --> 01:31:41.384
I love working in the round.

01:31:41.518 --> 01:31:44.804
I'm knocking 'em dead.
You don't like stand-up? Then sit down!

01:31:44.895 --> 01:31:47.517
Thank you and good night,
ladies and germs.

01:31:51.652 --> 01:31:54.571
How do you work this? Wrong way.
That's better.

01:31:54.655 --> 01:31:55.818
Alan?

01:32:00.704 --> 01:32:02.280
You should go now.

01:32:02.705 --> 01:32:04.698
Archer, listen.

01:32:05.083 --> 01:32:08.866
When that thing explodes,
you'll be fried, too.

01:32:10.755 --> 01:32:12.083
Go.

01:32:16.386 --> 01:32:18.711
Take that!

01:32:21.432 --> 01:32:22.807
Watch your back.

01:32:22.892 --> 01:32:24.385
Thanks, Dad.

01:32:28.773 --> 01:32:30.931
I'm watching your back, Alan.

01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:46.157
What are you packing, Tiny?

01:32:46.291 --> 01:32:48.447
Packing? I'm packing you!

01:32:55.257 --> 01:32:58.128
It's not a prank call. It's not.

01:32:58.219 --> 01:32:59.879
No, wait. It is!

01:33:00.303 --> 01:33:04.551
So you'll send some cops
to come and arrest me? Don't hang up!

01:33:07.728 --> 01:33:09.520
Do you know what you're doing?

01:33:10.272 --> 01:33:11.767
Yeah.

01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:40.458
Die!

01:33:45.724 --> 01:33:47.800
Ain't war hell?

01:33:56.402 --> 01:33:58.559
Thanks for the lift, Punch-it.

01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:07.568
Mayday! Mayday! I'm hit!

01:34:10.082 --> 01:34:12.572
I'm going down! Ejecting!

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.090
Expect no mercy.

01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:56.287
Having fun yet?

01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:06.467
Let's have a round and a round
of applause for Archer...

01:35:06.555 --> 01:35:09.556
...emissary of the Gorgonites. You're up!

01:35:15.646 --> 01:35:17.474
Major Chip Hazard.

01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:20.474
Gorgonite scum!

01:35:20.652 --> 01:35:23.688
Leave Alan alone. Your fight is with me.

01:35:23.822 --> 01:35:25.814
You've got a lot of guts.

01:35:26.157 --> 01:35:28.483
Let's see what they look like.

01:35:30.663 --> 01:35:33.746
They're wires and metal,
the same as yours.

01:35:36.166 --> 01:35:40.331
We're nothing alike.
You are programmed to lose.

01:35:43.216 --> 01:35:45.255
I'm also programmed to learn.

01:35:46.845 --> 01:35:49.845
Too bad you never learned to win.

01:35:53.016 --> 01:35:55.010
School's out, loser.

01:36:02.651 --> 01:36:04.276
Victory is ours!

01:36:04.404 --> 01:36:06.312
Have I got a shock for you.

01:36:07.532 --> 01:36:09.358
You stupid toy!

01:36:33.349 --> 01:36:35.341
Run for it! Watch out!

01:36:50.199 --> 01:36:51.528
Get on!

01:36:52.952 --> 01:36:55.952
Is this going to be a pattern
for our relationship?

01:36:56.454 --> 01:36:57.782
Relationship?

01:36:59.709 --> 01:37:02.199
- This isn't dangerous, is it?
- Well...

01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:15.883
It's dead!

01:37:23.232 --> 01:37:24.476
Are you all right?

01:37:36.078 --> 01:37:37.239
Medic!

01:37:38.789 --> 01:37:41.114
There will be no mercy.

01:37:54.596 --> 01:37:57.763
Situation is stabilizing.
Local law enforcement is under control.

01:37:57.849 --> 01:38:01.134
It's just a matter of compensating
those involved.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:13.948
The area is secure. Bring him in.

01:38:18.285 --> 01:38:20.277
Who is that?

01:38:22.124 --> 01:38:24.958
Oh, no. It's him.

01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:49.435
How you doing, Joe?

01:38:49.985 --> 01:38:52.225
- Would you do me a big favor?
- Anything, sir.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.147
Move your truck with the giant GloboTech
logo before the news crews get here.

01:38:58.326 --> 01:39:01.327
I don't know, Mr. Mars,
I may have trouble handling the gears.

01:39:01.579 --> 01:39:05.576
What with the critical head injury
and emotional distress I've suffered lately.

01:39:07.668 --> 01:39:09.578
- Thank you.
- Right away, sir!

01:39:09.754 --> 01:39:12.126
Excuse me. You're not off the hook yet.

01:39:12.256 --> 01:39:15.625
There's the matter of the massive damage
to my home, my garage...

01:39:15.718 --> 01:39:18.339
...my audio-visual system...

01:39:18.596 --> 01:39:20.422
- This is good.
- Bye-bye.

01:39:21.264 --> 01:39:25.429
Excuse me, Mr. Whoever-You-Are.
What about our house?

01:39:27.730 --> 01:39:29.888
What about the pain and the anguish...

01:39:30.024 --> 01:39:32.015
- Humiliation.
- The humiliation.

01:39:32.192 --> 01:39:35.027
I don't think even you
have enough money to pay for that.

01:39:35.447 --> 01:39:37.771
Okay, maybe you do.

01:39:38.615 --> 01:39:40.774
Hey, Alan. Keep your nose clean, kid.

01:39:40.867 --> 01:39:43.359
I'll try. Listen...

01:39:44.539 --> 01:39:46.697
...I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:39:48.459 --> 01:39:49.787
Forget it.

01:39:51.753 --> 01:39:53.415
Toys is hell.

01:39:54.215 --> 01:39:59.042
Mr. Mars, I just wanted
to assure you that...

01:40:00.012 --> 01:40:02.502
...I take full responsibility for this.

01:40:02.598 --> 01:40:04.840
Yeah, right. Give me that.

01:40:05.517 --> 01:40:07.510
What were we charging for these?

01:40:07.603 --> 01:40:09.346
$79.95.

01:40:09.854 --> 01:40:12.180
Add a few zeros
to the end of that number...

01:40:12.441 --> 01:40:14.350
...and contact our military division.

01:40:14.943 --> 01:40:18.776
I know some South American rebels
who will find these toys very entertaining.

01:40:20.198 --> 01:40:22.357
Dad, you know my birthday?

01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:26.027
I just want clothes.

01:40:26.496 --> 01:40:27.824
Come on, Christy.

01:40:33.212 --> 01:40:34.954
Any sign of the Gorgonites?

01:40:35.046 --> 01:40:37.038
No, none of them.

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:39.793
Come on, Christy.

01:40:40.051 --> 01:40:41.380
I better go.

01:40:51.396 --> 01:40:54.895
Too bad. This would have made
a hell of a commercial.

01:41:27.932 --> 01:41:29.260
Archer?

01:41:43.907 --> 01:41:47.738
Archer, are you all right?
Halt! Who goes there?

01:41:48.912 --> 01:41:52.245
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

01:41:52.373 --> 01:41:55.658
Greetings. I am Archer,
emissary of the Gorgonites.

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:59.582
Your chip got fried,
just like the Commandos'.

01:42:01.757 --> 01:42:03.584
The Commandos are dead?

01:42:07.096 --> 01:42:10.014
Gorgonites, we won.

01:42:10.265 --> 01:42:11.926
We did?

01:42:12.102 --> 01:42:14.770
Well, that's a pleasant surprise.

01:42:15.854 --> 01:42:19.306
The satellite dish must have shielded
you guys. Pretty smart.

01:42:19.441 --> 01:42:20.935
Smart? We were lucky.

01:42:21.027 --> 01:42:22.854
I'm glad you made it, Archer.

01:42:22.945 --> 01:42:25.614
I'm glad you made it, Alan.

01:42:28.116 --> 01:42:30.156
Gorgonites, we are free!

01:42:30.536 --> 01:42:32.862
Thank you, Alan, destroyer of Commandos.

01:42:32.955 --> 01:42:34.152
We're free.

01:42:34.288 --> 01:42:36.034
Free? What about the cover charge?

01:42:37.877 --> 01:42:40.202
Let me get in first. I'm big.

01:42:40.338 --> 01:42:43.956
I'll sit in the crow's nest.
Hey, there's a dead crow up here.

01:42:44.633 --> 01:42:46.127
I'm kidding.

01:42:49.637 --> 01:42:51.513
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:42:51.598 --> 01:42:53.924
Yes, Alan. It is time.

01:42:54.643 --> 01:42:57.313
Archer, I understand why, but...

01:42:57.981 --> 01:43:01.645
...you may not find Gorgon.
It may not even...

01:43:02.318 --> 01:43:06.980
Even if you can't see something,
it doesn't mean it isn't there.

01:43:14.997 --> 01:43:17.074
Look, we're out to launch!

01:43:18.626 --> 01:43:20.784
I'm seasick already.

01:43:21.338 --> 01:43:22.498
Bye-bye, Alan.

01:43:22.588 --> 01:43:26.003
Bye-bye, Alan. Nice knowing you.

01:43:56.538 --> 01:44:00.157
Anybody from out of town here?
Where are you from, sir?

01:44:00.251 --> 01:44:01.246
Gorgon.

01:44:01.334 --> 01:44:05.663
What exit? Hello? Is this thing on?
Is this a boat or an oil painting?

01:44:06.214 --> 01:44:09.216
I hope we don't hit an iceberg.

01:49:26.366 --> 01:49:29.070
Nuclear warhead?
What are you talking about?

01:49:30.159 --> 01:49:31.653
Was that too much?

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.825
<i>I've never heard you say that before.</i>

01:49:39.305 --> 01:49:45.212
