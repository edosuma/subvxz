INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY,
THIS FILM IS FICTION.

00:08.208 --> 00:10.000
CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL.

00:36.791 --> 00:39.750
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:56.833 --> 00:59.083
Last name, first name,
date of birth, please.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.250
Grégory Cerva. C-E-R-V-A.

01:01.333 --> 01:02.541
September 4, 1976.

01:02.625 --> 01:04.583
-Any family?
-No.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.708
Give me your left hand.

01:12.958 --> 01:14.125
All four fingers.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.958
Over there, back against the wall.

01:37.208 --> 01:39.500
TN13, BAC 26. Officers in pursuit.

01:39.583 --> 01:41.916
We're in Corbière
chasing a stolen scooter with no plates.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.833
8 MONTHS EARLIER

01:42.916 --> 01:43.791
The make is a Yamaha.

01:43.875 --> 01:46.458
The suspect isn't wearing a helmet
and refuses to pull over.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.875
Continue the pursuit.
Describe progress.

01:48.958 --> 01:50.083
Pull over!

01:50.166 --> 01:52.458
The suspect is going uphill!

01:52.541 --> 01:55.125
He's still refusing to pull over!
Still refusing!

01:55.208 --> 01:57.583
-Speed up, Greg.
-I know. I'm trying.

01:57.666 --> 02:00.708
Stay on him! Stay on him!
Fuck, speed up!

02:00.791 --> 02:03.041
-Hey, hey!
-Hey! Pull over!

02:03.125 --> 02:06.583
-Pull over and we'll talk!
-He still refuses to pull over.

02:06.666 --> 02:09.416
Officers in pursuit.
I repeat, officers in pursuit.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.458
Shit! Fuck!

02:30.125 --> 02:30.958
Stop!

02:38.291 --> 02:39.125
Hey!

02:41.083 --> 02:41.916
Shit!

02:45.666 --> 02:48.916
-Can't believe I didn't catch this junk.
-Didn't run fast enough, man.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.208
You run like my grandmother.
If it'd been me…

02:51.875 --> 02:52.958
"Me"? Where were you?

02:53.041 --> 02:55.791
Behind your slow ass.
If I'd run ahead, he'd be in cuffs.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.875
-If you ran ahead. Sorry.
-Yeah, right.

02:57.958 --> 02:59.375
I was in front, so I let you pass.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.791
What are you laughing at, huh?
You just stayed in the car, asshole.

03:04.416 --> 03:07.458
We'll have to do two hours of paperwork
over a piece of shit stolen scooter.

03:07.541 --> 03:08.958
It doesn't even have plates!

03:10.375 --> 03:11.875
We're not doing this today.

03:15.000 --> 03:15.916
-No.
-What?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.916
-Forget it.
-What? Forget what? I didn't say anything.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.250
-But you're going to.
-Come on. Shall we get stupid?

03:21.333 --> 03:22.625
-Here we go.
-I'll call.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.666
-Yeah, it's me.
-Let me call back in five.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.125
-Wait.
-What do you want?

03:35.208 --> 03:39.083
I need some quick info. Know what block
your neighborhood dealer's on today?

03:39.166 --> 03:42.708
No one's selling around my place today.
Go to Félix Pyat. The dealer's in Block C.

03:42.791 --> 03:43.666
All right.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.041
Good stuff. Go ahead. I'll follow.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.375
-Giddy up.
-Let's do this.

03:50.416 --> 03:52.125
-Let's go the back way!
-Hear hear.

04:03.625 --> 04:06.208
We're coming up on the lookout.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.416
Looking for that fire.

04:18.916 --> 04:20.041
Slide on in.

04:25.708 --> 04:26.708
We're in.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.583
We're coming up on the block.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.500
Yeah. Not yet.

04:38.916 --> 04:40.166
Got eyes on the dealer.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.666
-All right, Greg. Head our way.
-Copy.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.375
Got a 20 sack, please?

05:04.291 --> 05:06.208
Police!

05:09.791 --> 05:11.833
5-0!

05:11.916 --> 05:13.666
Let go, you little bitch!

05:19.291 --> 05:21.208
Go, go! Come on, Greg, we got him!

05:29.958 --> 05:32.166
-Let's go. Move, move!
-Let me go, motherfucker!

05:34.625 --> 05:35.458
Faster!

05:37.416 --> 05:39.250
-I ain't got shit!
-What is that?

05:39.333 --> 05:40.833
-That's not mine!
-What's that?

05:40.916 --> 05:41.875
Fuck!

05:46.333 --> 05:48.833
Motherfucker. This might hurt a bit.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.000
We got this. Faster!

07:00.750 --> 07:01.583
Here.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.833
Hey! Only five?

07:07.750 --> 07:09.791
What do you mean, only five?
That was the deal.

07:09.875 --> 07:13.208
The dealer from Félix Pyat,
that was a big deal, right?

07:15.541 --> 07:18.083
-Yeah, it was a big deal.
-So break me off here, please.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.708
-I'm trying to get paid over here.
-Why you trying to play me?

07:22.416 --> 07:23.958
Aah!

07:25.625 --> 07:27.875
Nah, I'm serious.
The price for fire is high out there.

07:27.958 --> 07:29.250
-Ah, yeah?
-It's true.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.416
-Your government's breaking our balls.
-Gimme a hit.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.375
Come on. Like they don't know
who's buying all that hash?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.125
Your face. Turn.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.875
Looks like you got rocked.

07:43.958 --> 07:46.750
-I took a punch, yeah.
-Yeah, you got hit with a brick.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.583
-You should've seen the other guy.
-Oh, you're such a pussy.

07:53.916 --> 07:56.166
-Amel.
-Fuck around, and fall in that water.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.208
I'm the one going in?

07:58.291 --> 08:01.291
-Stop! Stop! Quit playing!
-Ooh! Don't mess with the bull.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.666
-Wanna get some grub? Your treat.
-Here, smoke. No, your treat.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.583
You only gave me five sticks.
So you're buying, big timer.

08:09.291 --> 08:10.166
Put that away.

08:10.666 --> 08:12.458
-Relax. No one's gonna steal it.
-Put it away.

08:12.541 --> 08:15.750
-Can you smoke, please?
-What if someone walks by? Put that away.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.250
How's it going?

08:30.125 --> 08:31.916
What the hell are you doing here?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.625
You didn't do nothing, right?

08:35.500 --> 08:37.000
Hey. What's up, man?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.791
Yo, brother. What's happening?

08:40.083 --> 08:42.125
-Is this place a zoo today or what?
-Shut your mouth!

08:43.750 --> 08:45.166
Thanks, Laurence.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.041
All right.

08:48.916 --> 08:51.916
We can't continue like this. Every time
he sees a vehicle, it turns into a war.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.875
Too much damage, Greg.

08:53.958 --> 08:56.458
Some damage, 200 grams,
and a dealer off the street isn't nothing.

08:56.541 --> 08:59.583
The headlight, a bumper,
a rear fender, that's 3,000 euros!

08:59.666 --> 09:01.916
-That's how we're keeping score?
-Please, Greg. Stop it.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.208
The guys upstairs
are breaking my balls 24/7.

09:04.291 --> 09:07.416
They're up my ass
every time you pull this bullshit. Huh?

09:09.708 --> 09:12.750
Also, you need to stop
hanging around those fucking ghettos.

09:12.833 --> 09:14.541
-Making dealer runs.
-Someone has to.

09:14.625 --> 09:18.375
No one gives a fuck about 100 euros.
You need to get this through your head.

09:18.458 --> 09:22.208
A small-time pickpocket or big-time dealer
hits our numbers just the same.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.416
All they want us to do is meet our quota.
That, and clean arrests.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.416
-Clean arrests.
-Yeah, clean arrests.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.791
Try taking police reports, for example.
That's efficient.

09:29.875 --> 09:33.375
It's never that way with dealers.
They're nothing but a headache. Look…

09:34.625 --> 09:37.208
Drug trafficking,
Félix Pyat, plus one. You see?

09:37.291 --> 09:39.083
Cigarettes, smuggling, plus one.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.000
-Mugging, plus one.
-That's quality?

09:41.083 --> 09:44.375
-That the quality you're talking about?
-It's a fucking plus one.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.958
I repeat, a road accident
at the Grand Littoral store.

09:54.041 --> 09:55.750
In the parking lot, level two.

09:57.083 --> 09:59.083
Um, Car 14, your patrol is over.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.916
Message received. Have a good night.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.291
I went and saw the baby with Nora.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.583
-And?
-Yeah.

10:14.125 --> 10:15.500
It was in 3D. It was weird.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.916
TV13, head for Le Merlan--

10:18.000 --> 10:21.166
I mean, he looked kinda weird.
He looks like a little alien.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.625
What you talking about, 3D?

10:22.708 --> 10:25.458
I mean 3D. I don't know.
You can see the baby in 3D.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.541
It's super weird.

10:26.625 --> 10:27.916
You get glasses?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.041
-Huh?
-Glasses.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.791
No, idiot. You're such an idiot.

10:30.875 --> 10:32.708
-The image is in 3D.
-You think that?

10:32.791 --> 10:35.833
It lets you see all the… the baby.

10:35.916 --> 10:37.708
Ehh, it's not actually 3D.

10:37.791 --> 10:40.250
No, not like 3D at the movies. It's not--

10:40.333 --> 10:43.291
-Why'd you say it's 3D like the movies?
-Forget it.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.291
-So, no glasses?
-No, no glasses.

10:46.375 --> 10:47.458
OK. That's what's up.

10:48.750 --> 10:49.750
-I swear--
-Dickhead.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.083
Does he look like you?

10:51.583 --> 10:53.333
I think he has my eyes.

10:53.416 --> 10:56.583
-As long as he doesn't have your mug.
-I know, right?

10:56.666 --> 10:57.500
Fuck!

11:08.333 --> 11:09.583
-How you living?
-Good, you?

11:09.666 --> 11:12.375
Listen, chief,
that ginger friend of yours,

11:12.458 --> 11:14.083
he straight-up
grabbed my cousin yesterday.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.333
He stripped him,
robbed him, and beat him up.

11:16.416 --> 11:18.875
Not cool. What can I say?
He's an asshole. It is what it is.

11:18.958 --> 11:20.083
Could you talk to him for me?

11:20.166 --> 11:22.375
Sure. Enough of your life story.
Got any intel for me?

11:22.458 --> 11:24.416
No, bro. I swear, I just started my shift.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.666
-Look, my bag is full.
-Why do you swear?

11:26.750 --> 11:28.333
-So you believe me.
-Nothing going on?

11:28.416 --> 11:31.958
Not right now. If I hear anything,
I'll call you. You know that.

11:32.041 --> 11:35.166
-Look, we're just selling our cigarettes.
-OK.

11:35.250 --> 11:38.375
-I only sell cigarettes.
-All right, enough. Give me a carton.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.291
-All you.
-OK.

11:40.375 --> 11:41.541
Have a great day.

11:58.791 --> 12:01.208
That's nothing. Don't worry about it.
Nothing there.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.125
Hmm?

12:03.291 --> 12:05.208
Thank you. Thank you very much.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.666
Oh, nice to see you!

12:06.750 --> 12:08.666
-How's it going, chief?
-How's the family?

12:08.750 --> 12:10.958
-Want three kebabs per usual?
-Yes, sir.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.458
Want extra harissa,
lettuce, tomatoes, onions?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.250
Oh, here we go.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.458
-Check out your boy over there.
-Who?

12:26.541 --> 12:28.958
-The guy by the fruit.
-Which guy by the fruit?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.333
The guy right there
with the hoodie.

12:31.833 --> 12:32.791
Yeah?

12:32.875 --> 12:35.541
Twenty euros
he's gonna grab that old lady's wallet.

12:35.625 --> 12:38.958
No, that guy's too relaxed.
Hands in his pockets, not looking around.

12:39.041 --> 12:40.375
Nah.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.250
-Twenty bucks, you're on.
-Let's go.

12:43.916 --> 12:45.083
Come on, big fella.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.166
She's just a little old lady.

12:48.250 --> 12:51.125
-You got this, get busy!
-It's not gonna happen for you.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.291
-What's he doing?
-He's holding a melon and smelling it.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.583
Oh no! Goodbye, ma'am.

12:59.666 --> 13:01.125
Oh, weak sauce.

13:01.625 --> 13:04.208
-Hey! Where's my 20?
-I don't have any cash.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.791
You're such a cheapskate.
You never have any money.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.000
You probably spent it all on that haircut.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.333
Ask for your money back. There's lunch!

13:11.833 --> 13:13.083
-Ah!
-This is for you.

13:13.166 --> 13:15.000
-You hook it up?
-Got your extra meat.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.250
And samurai sauce. Don't worry, I got you.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.500
-Bon appétit, my friends.
-Mm!

13:24.875 --> 13:28.000
There are turtle vendors over there.
Shall we get them?

13:28.083 --> 13:29.875
-How many are there?
-Two.

13:29.958 --> 13:31.708
That'll get us today's quota.

13:32.875 --> 13:33.708
Hmm?

13:34.750 --> 13:35.958
Nah, I don't do turtles.

13:36.958 --> 13:38.166
What does that mean?

13:39.666 --> 13:41.541
What don't you understand?
I don't do turtles.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.916
No, no, no. Wait.
Why don't you do turtles?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.791
-I don't do turtles.
-You wouldn't do turtles?

13:45.875 --> 13:48.333
-I'm not doing turtles.
-You're gonna do turtles.

13:48.416 --> 13:51.541
-We have to go back with something.
-Think of the animals.

13:51.625 --> 13:54.875
-Bro, in my sauce, you serious?
-"I don't do turtles," that's bullshit.

13:54.958 --> 13:57.041
-I don't do turtles.
-Think of the animals.

14:00.791 --> 14:02.291
-Gentlemen.
-Hello, sir.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.708
Who do these turtles belong to?

14:05.791 --> 14:07.208
-They're not ours.
-Not ours.

14:07.291 --> 14:08.416
-Oh yeah?
-Not ours.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.666
You know it's illegal to sell these?

14:10.750 --> 14:13.291
-Yes, but sir--
-This species is protected.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.250
Illegal, yeah. But they're not ours.

14:15.333 --> 14:18.583
-Stop treating us like fools.
-We told you, they're not ours.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.125
-Your pockets.
-What do you mean?

14:21.208 --> 14:23.375
-Empty your pockets.
-Nothing in them. What's the deal?

14:24.125 --> 14:26.500
-Empty them right now.
-Sir, there's nothing in my pockets.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.583
-Hey! What'd you slap him for?
-Empty your pockets.

14:28.666 --> 14:30.583
-Empty them!
-What do you think you're doing?

14:30.666 --> 14:33.333
What's your problem?
Empty your fucking pockets.

14:33.416 --> 14:34.916
-That's not yours?
-Empty them.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.250
-I told you to empty them.
-We're good men.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.333
Pick 'em up!

14:38.416 --> 14:40.958
-What are you doing? It's getting away.
-Pick 'em up.

14:41.708 --> 14:44.000
-Where do you live?
-The 15th.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.958
-So, you're from around here?
-Yeah, it's my home.

14:48.541 --> 14:50.208
Oh, these are my colleagues.

14:52.041 --> 14:55.083
-I gotta roll. Nice to meet you.
-They're here for turtles?

14:55.583 --> 14:57.333
Hey, Momo. Do I owe you anything?

14:57.416 --> 14:59.416
-OK, no problem.
-Put her on my tab too.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.416
-Whoa, whoa. Big-time collar!
-Shut up. Get in the car.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.583
-Stop acting high and mighty.
-What's your problem?

15:04.666 --> 15:08.291
All units in the northern sector,
active car jacking in the 15th.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.208
-A black Audi.
-TN13. BAC 26, we're on it.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.291
Go on, get outta here.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.833
Popo!

15:27.375 --> 15:29.000
Popo!

15:29.083 --> 15:30.250
Fucking hell!

15:31.291 --> 15:33.791
-Shit!
-BAC 26, TN13, abandon pursuit.

15:33.875 --> 15:35.416
Do not enter the ghettos.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.125
-These guys are fired up.
-Let's go.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.500
What's the problem?

15:44.166 --> 15:45.666
Huh? What are you doing here?

15:45.750 --> 15:48.083
We were following a stolen car.
You see it?

15:48.666 --> 15:51.208
-You're the only person I've seen.
-Really? Didn't see anything?

15:51.291 --> 15:52.208
Well, then.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.666
BAC 26, this is TN13.
Respond to my message.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.833
Your friend over there must be hot.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.416
-Looks like you the one in the heat.
-I'm perfectly comfortable.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.916
Do not enter the ghetto.
Abandon pursuit immediately.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.875
Well, then. They're calling you.
You should probably go.

16:08.583 --> 16:09.625
You're the law now?

16:12.125 --> 16:14.875
I'm not the law. Me, I'm a diplomat.

16:14.958 --> 16:18.375
Here to protect you.
But if you wanna go in, go ahead.

16:19.541 --> 16:21.875
-You know what?
-Hey, come on.

16:21.958 --> 16:26.208
They'll probably be into it.
Haven't seen cops for a while. Go for it.

16:27.916 --> 16:30.541
They're inviting you in.
You don't wanna go?

16:33.583 --> 16:37.416
This is TN13, get out immediately.
I repeat, get out immediately.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.708
I repeat, get out immediately. I repeat--

16:41.625 --> 16:43.125
-Son of a bitch!
-Easy, guys.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.708
-Motherfucker!
-Easy, guys. Nothing to see.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.666
These little bitches just got
a little worked up.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.041
About done breaking our balls.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.166
You're about done
breaking our balls, right?

16:53.250 --> 16:55.708
You done breaking my balls,
mark-ass bitch?

16:55.791 --> 16:58.000
Shut your mouth
and get the fuck outta here!

16:58.083 --> 16:59.791
You heard me, you little pussy?

17:01.375 --> 17:02.791
You ain't shit without your boys.

17:02.875 --> 17:05.291
Without them, who, what would you be?
Nothing!

17:05.375 --> 17:08.958
Who'd you be without that badge?
Without your boys, you'd be nothing!

17:09.791 --> 17:10.791
Time's up!

17:12.125 --> 17:13.625
Roll out, or come with.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.458
You're not nothing.

17:18.541 --> 17:21.000
Yo, come and get some
or get lost, pig!

17:21.500 --> 17:24.666
-Go home, blue!
-Talking all that shit!

17:24.750 --> 17:27.250
Just to leave,
walk outta here like a little bitch!

17:27.750 --> 17:30.291
You guys ain't shit.
Next time, bring some muscle!

17:30.375 --> 17:32.666
That's right, go on!

17:36.708 --> 17:39.625
Come on, get gone! Go, go.
Go fuck your sisters!

17:39.708 --> 17:42.291
Fuck your mother.
Fuck your sister.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.458
And fuck your dad!

17:45.041 --> 17:47.375
-That's right, get outta here!
-Beat it, boy.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.458
-Yeah, and don't come back!
-Fuck you!

17:51.500 --> 17:53.041
Yo, fuck off, pussies!

17:59.708 --> 18:01.583
Guys, I brought you some sick gifts.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.333
Come on, Mamadou.

18:05.958 --> 18:07.583
Hey, you here legally, at least?

18:14.208 --> 18:15.208
Greg?

18:15.291 --> 18:17.625
No, Jérôme. I don't need this.
Don't bust my balls.

18:17.708 --> 18:20.208
We didn't go in the ghetto,
didn't arrest anyone.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.541
You asked us to walk away, we did.
I don't need a lecture--

18:22.625 --> 18:24.625
Wait. I didn't come here
to yell at you. It's fine.

18:24.708 --> 18:25.833
Then why are you here?

18:29.125 --> 18:32.041
I know. I know what it's like.
I've been where you are.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.625
-No. You don't know.
-Greg, I do.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.166
-You don't know why.
-Of course I do.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.166
Why do you think I chose a desk job
ten years ago?

18:37.250 --> 18:40.375
-'Cause you're smart and I'm a moron.
-Stop it, you're not a moron.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.083
Because the field is…

18:43.916 --> 18:46.083
'Cause it's frustrating there.

18:46.166 --> 18:49.541
Shit. I feel you. You feel like you're…
Like you're suffocating.

18:50.291 --> 18:51.208
Right?

18:51.291 --> 18:52.750
We're useless.

18:53.875 --> 18:54.958
We're useless now.

18:55.666 --> 18:56.625
It's over.

18:57.375 --> 19:01.083
The more we do, the less we achieve.
I don't understand how we got here.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.708
I don't know, maybe it's too late.

19:05.958 --> 19:09.000
These people have lost all hope
that we're here to help them.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.833
They're resigned to living in the shit
'cause we can't help them.

19:11.916 --> 19:15.166
As soon as we step foot in the ghettos,
we get assaulted, spat on,

19:15.250 --> 19:17.000
I get called a pussy every day.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.000
Every day I get called a pussy!

19:19.083 --> 19:20.291
But we can't make waves.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.125
We can't break our equipment.

19:24.708 --> 19:27.000
Just laissez-faire. So there it is.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.250
It is what it is. Maybe we have a plan
and I just don't get it. What's the plan?

19:32.750 --> 19:35.125
Explain it to me, please.
What are we doing?

19:42.458 --> 19:45.083
911. What's your emergency?

19:45.166 --> 19:46.208
Yes.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.708
Ma'am, we're contacting
the fire department now.

19:48.791 --> 19:50.000
911, what's your emergency?

19:50.083 --> 19:52.541
The pickpocket stealing wallets
in Grand Littoral is back.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.625
Know where he went?

19:53.708 --> 19:56.083
He's at the Mirabeau entrance.
He's wearing a red sweatshirt.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.916
May I ask you for your name, please?

19:59.000 --> 19:59.833
Hello?

20:07.625 --> 20:08.916
-It's me.
-Yeah, babe.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.458
Remember the gypsy stealing wallets
at Grand Littoral?

20:11.541 --> 20:14.000
-Yeah.
-I just got a report. He's in Mirabeau.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.875
-Red sweatshirt.
-OK. Thanks, babe.

20:15.958 --> 20:18.958
OK. but hurry up, OK?
I didn't transfer it to central.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.416
Go on!

20:38.208 --> 20:39.500
Open the door!

20:41.416 --> 20:43.333
-No, no. Antoine!
-Come here!

20:47.291 --> 20:48.833
What's all this paper, huh?

20:48.916 --> 20:51.000
-Dealing now?
-Quit your crying!

20:56.166 --> 20:58.333
For real, we should've taken that cash.

20:59.375 --> 21:00.375
Are you stupid?

21:00.875 --> 21:01.708
What for?

21:02.500 --> 21:03.958
The ginger helps himself.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.708
Navaro, jump in here?

21:06.625 --> 21:08.125
-Enough, babe.
-What you want us to say?

21:08.208 --> 21:10.833
-He's just an idiot. That's the way it is.
-An idiot?

21:11.333 --> 21:12.291
Just saying.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.666
No, seriously.
Go ahead and play at being gangsters.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.208
-Babe, drop it.
-I'm serious.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.333
I want Tata Escobar's life too.

21:18.416 --> 21:20.916
I'm covered in Yass and merguez.
I want jet skis,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.708
someone to slide lobsters into my mouth,
roll in a bimmer like Grace Kelly.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.541
Maybe then you can buy a flat iron.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.250
And you can buy real smokes.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.416
-Enough with the gypsy cigs.
-Hey, please.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.291
They smoke just like the real ones.

21:37.875 --> 21:40.791
Hey, Gambinos,
help me set the table. Let's go!

21:40.875 --> 21:43.541
Hey, hold up.
Is that any way to treat a guest?

21:43.625 --> 21:46.541
He's talking about robbing a bank,
and you can't manage a couple of forks?

21:46.625 --> 21:49.291
-Burn!
-I can't wait till your woman pops.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.375
I never said rob a bank.

21:54.041 --> 21:55.166
-This all right?
-Yeah.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.500
-Perfect.
-Come on.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.166
Is this your plate?

21:59.291 --> 22:01.208
-Here.
-Some chicken, Antoine?

22:01.291 --> 22:02.541
No, I'll take a merguez.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.833
Wow, you really burned
these sausages, Yass.

22:06.916 --> 22:08.083
Oh!

22:08.625 --> 22:11.291
-They're cooked, bro.
-They're not cooked, they're burned.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.833
-Greg?
-No.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.083
-For once.
-Straight protein.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.750
Just try it once, for me.

22:15.833 --> 22:17.833
I don't wanna try your tomatoes.

22:19.041 --> 22:20.625
Yass, this is inedible.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.166
-It's delicious.
-Inedible.

22:22.250 --> 22:25.000
It's delicious. You said
you wanted it crunchy, I made it crunchy.

22:25.083 --> 22:26.458
It's not crunchy, it's overcooked.

22:26.541 --> 22:28.791
-But it's crunchy.
-They are tough.

22:29.416 --> 22:31.916
-You wanted it crunchy, it's crunchy!
-Chill, my love.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.666
-Did you make the tabbouleh?
-Yes.

22:33.750 --> 22:34.958
Really good.

22:35.041 --> 22:36.625
-Oh, you ass-kisser.
-Well, hey.

22:36.708 --> 22:38.291
-For real?
-Try! Try this too.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.291
-"Did you make the tabbouleh?"
-There's mint.

22:40.375 --> 22:42.958
"Oh, your tabbouleh's so good!"

22:44.208 --> 22:46.708
-Seriously, it's so good.
-Who cooks for you?

22:47.583 --> 22:48.958
Well, I cook for myself.

22:49.041 --> 22:50.500
-All by yourself?
-Not like this.

22:50.583 --> 22:52.583
Your neighbor still a pain in your ass?

22:52.666 --> 22:53.916
No, he's calmed down.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.458
-Yeah?
-Broke his nose.

22:57.958 --> 22:59.291
-Are you kidding?
-No.

22:59.375 --> 23:00.375
He's 60.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.791
Well, if he showed some respect.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.875
Yeah, but you gotta stop
beating everyone up.

23:04.958 --> 23:06.250
What's going on with you?

23:06.791 --> 23:08.916
Hasn't given me a problem since.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.833
See?

23:15.041 --> 23:16.875
-What's that?
-Yass, you seeing this?

23:16.958 --> 23:18.750
Shit, this is so embarrassing.

23:18.833 --> 23:20.875
-Hey, Daddy, wake up. Come on!
-Grab something!

23:20.958 --> 23:22.500
-They gotta go?
-What do I do?

23:22.583 --> 23:24.333
-So, we're going?
-Um… Uh…

23:24.416 --> 23:25.291
-Let's go.
-Shit!

23:25.375 --> 23:27.208
-You OK, babe?
-Yass, come on. Hurry.

23:27.291 --> 23:28.458
-Got it.
-Hurry!

23:28.541 --> 23:31.458
-Make sure you bring the hospital bag.
-I got everything.

23:48.916 --> 23:49.750
Again.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.958
Hey. Hey!

23:55.041 --> 23:56.625
My brother's a daddy!

23:58.791 --> 24:01.666
More, Mando. Again, again!

24:04.000 --> 24:06.333
Hey, on me. Drinks are on me!

24:12.208 --> 24:13.750
I'm fucking hammered!

24:26.958 --> 24:30.083
Call 911. Call 911!

25:02.916 --> 25:04.083
Move!

25:04.166 --> 25:06.041
Quit crying, you little bitch!

25:08.625 --> 25:10.750
I said stop crying!
Give me your fucking hand!

25:10.833 --> 25:12.500
Here, film him. Film him!

25:12.583 --> 25:14.041
Shut the fuck up!

25:14.125 --> 25:18.250
-I said stop crying! Shut the fuck up!
-You rob our customers, you little thief?

25:23.291 --> 25:24.875
Hey, neighbors, listen up!

25:24.958 --> 25:28.916
Here, you can buy with peace of mind.
Here, we're the police. Believe that!

25:33.291 --> 25:35.833
There. Went viral, huh?
Three million views.

25:37.375 --> 25:38.875
Prefect must be thrilled.

25:38.958 --> 25:42.458
Ah, you know it. He's delighted.
He wants our response to be, in his words,

25:42.541 --> 25:44.666
front page news-worthy
all across the country.

25:44.750 --> 25:47.208
Listen, we need to go all out.
Make a big splash.

25:47.291 --> 25:50.333
-Know where this is?
-Yeah, the big complex near the water.

25:52.666 --> 25:53.666
Yeah…

25:54.708 --> 25:55.541
What?

25:56.125 --> 25:58.041
You've wanted
to take these drug networks down.

25:58.125 --> 25:59.208
Here's your ticket.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.375
You said we couldn't go
into ghettos anymore.

26:01.458 --> 26:03.333
Well, things change. Now you have to go.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.458
You're sucking up to the prefect?

26:09.125 --> 26:09.958
Greg,

26:10.500 --> 26:11.958
this case is yours.

26:12.541 --> 26:16.291
Voila. You run the show.
You pick your team. Whatever you say goes.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.875
-Ah, I dunno.
-En garde!

26:17.958 --> 26:19.666
Whoa!

26:19.750 --> 26:21.416
You think you can sneak up on me?

26:21.500 --> 26:22.583
-Let's go!
-Don't back off.

26:22.666 --> 26:25.541
Wanna see what happens when
you mess with the bull? You get owned!

26:26.125 --> 26:27.708
This referee's the fucking worst.

26:27.791 --> 26:29.916
He's all short,
blowing his whistle to make up for it.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.833
So angry 'cause he's short and bald.

26:32.833 --> 26:36.166
Yeah, go on. Take notes, take notes.

26:36.250 --> 26:40.458
Seriously, that coach gets on my nerves!
Always taking notes. Nose in his notebook!

26:40.541 --> 26:43.375
What's he writing down?
We haven't done anything in 20 minutes!

26:43.458 --> 26:44.791
What are you writing down?

26:47.833 --> 26:49.416
-By the way…
-Hmm?

26:49.500 --> 26:51.458
-What?
-You can count me in.

27:53.708 --> 27:57.458
Do you understand what I'm asking for?
I'm not asking you for a dealer here.

27:58.208 --> 28:01.875
We wanna take down the whole network.
You need to give us some real intel.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.208
A distribution center, you feel me?

28:04.291 --> 28:06.458
You must have a death wish,
asking for that.

28:06.541 --> 28:08.458
-Your cousin's from there.
-My cousin?

28:08.541 --> 28:10.208
What do you think you'll get
from my cousin?

28:10.291 --> 28:13.708
-Then from you.
-You want my cousin to dig my grave?

28:14.291 --> 28:17.541
You haven't been to that neighborhood
in ages. Don't you get what a mess it is?

28:17.625 --> 28:18.708
It's like Baghdad.

28:20.125 --> 28:22.333
The bosses stay high
from morning till night.

28:22.416 --> 28:24.833
They'll kill anyone to protect their turf.

28:24.916 --> 28:26.375
They're the law now.

28:26.458 --> 28:29.416
There are no more cops or politicians,
that's all that's left.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.458
For Eid celebrations, they take
the kids out and give them money.

28:34.041 --> 28:36.041
Other than that, they're heartless.

28:36.125 --> 28:38.500
They even fight amongst themselves
to control the network.

28:38.583 --> 28:41.958
As soon as a dealer keeps
a stick for himself, it rains bullets.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.458
There are no more rules. It's a jungle.

28:48.583 --> 28:51.625
I'm telling you,
the whole neighborhood's gone crazy.

28:54.500 --> 28:58.291
Amel… two kilos is your cut of the haul.

28:58.375 --> 29:00.625
I don't want two kilos from there.
What will I do with it?

29:00.708 --> 29:03.083
-Why?
-You know why? Have you seen this?

29:03.166 --> 29:04.250
Here, smell.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.541
That smell,
they're the only ones who make it.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.458
They're the only ones
who know what to put in it.

29:13.541 --> 29:15.083
It's one-of-a-kind hash.

29:15.916 --> 29:18.083
That's why
I can't take anything from there.

29:34.541 --> 29:35.541
Five kilos.

29:37.375 --> 29:40.250
Get me five kilos from somewhere else,
I'll get you what you need.

29:42.041 --> 29:42.875
Impossible.

29:43.833 --> 29:46.291
No, it's… That's out of the question.

29:46.375 --> 29:49.833
Really? Who gives a fuck?
Those drugs are gonna be destroyed anyway.

29:49.916 --> 29:53.416
We don't take drugs off of the streets
to put them back there. How can you ask?

29:53.500 --> 29:56.125
Oh, here we go.
Are you saying this is a moral issue?

29:56.208 --> 29:57.625
Taking drugs from the evidence room

29:57.708 --> 30:00.833
could cause other convictions
to get tossed. You know I can't.

30:00.916 --> 30:03.958
-We can't give the informant the haul.
-You have to.

30:04.458 --> 30:06.791
Won't work.
Using their hash is a non-starter.

30:06.875 --> 30:07.875
What do we do?

30:07.958 --> 30:10.166
Just do it. Figure it out.
I don't want to know.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.083
What does that mean?

30:11.166 --> 30:14.208
It means that you find drugs
that aren't under seal or something.

30:14.291 --> 30:16.875
So we take all the risks
and you hide behind your desk?

30:16.958 --> 30:19.000
-Whoa!
-Those are the prefect's orders.

30:19.083 --> 30:22.125
They want a police response.
My job is to give them a police response.

30:22.208 --> 30:25.041
-Does that work for you?
-Give us access to the drugs under seal.

30:25.125 --> 30:27.750
Why should I risk my career
if we aren't given what we need?

30:27.833 --> 30:29.750
Fuck this.
Nobody gives a shit about the ghettos.

30:29.833 --> 30:32.375
The prefect just wants positive press
in the front page.

30:32.458 --> 30:34.250
That's not true. You're wrong.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.708
So, then what's in it for us?

30:38.791 --> 30:39.625
Raises.

30:41.916 --> 30:43.541
-How much?
-I don't know.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.583
One, possibly two.

30:45.666 --> 30:47.166
Are you serious?

30:47.250 --> 30:49.958
We're gonna do this for 50,
100 euros tops per month?

30:50.041 --> 30:52.000
-And we're risking the blame?
-What blame?

30:52.083 --> 30:54.791
Worried a sanction could keep you
from taking your officer exam?

30:54.875 --> 30:56.416
-It looks bad.
-So what?

30:56.500 --> 30:58.000
You want to become an officer?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.125
Do this operation.

31:02.291 --> 31:03.750
Yeah. OK, we got it.

31:05.791 --> 31:06.791
Yeah.

31:07.375 --> 31:08.625
So, figure it out?

31:08.708 --> 31:09.708
That's right.

31:20.833 --> 31:22.666
-Good evening, police.
-Evening.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.833
Should we grab him?

31:40.916 --> 31:42.416
Come on.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.500
Park over there, sir.

31:48.208 --> 31:50.208
Evening, police. Can I ask you,
what you doing here?

31:50.291 --> 31:53.333
-I came to visit a friend.
-All right. Let's keep this simple.

31:53.416 --> 31:56.833
Either you give me the drugs you purchased
or I take you to the station.

31:56.916 --> 32:00.750
OK. Come on, empty your pockets.
Here, come on. Show me what you got.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.000
Well, your friend seems cool.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.125
-Is that all?
-It's all I have.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.833
-OK.
-All right, let's get outta here.

32:14.416 --> 32:18.041
-He fucking shit himself.
-He fucking shit himself.

32:19.916 --> 32:22.583
-Did you see that?
-Oh, I actually felt sorry for him.

32:26.208 --> 32:28.416
Hey, are you gonna sulk
like that all night?

32:29.291 --> 32:31.666
No, it's fine.
I'll take the next one. All good?

32:32.375 --> 32:33.500
OK?

32:50.750 --> 32:52.541
-Ooh!
-Come here!

32:52.625 --> 32:54.208
Let me go. Let me go!

32:54.833 --> 32:56.375
Caught in the act.

32:56.458 --> 32:59.166
-Will you help him already?
-No way, he's on him.

32:59.791 --> 33:02.458
Oh fuck!
Little fucker's fired up today.

33:02.541 --> 33:05.250
-Got him hog-tied.
-Are you spanking him?

33:05.333 --> 33:07.333
-Give him.
-Take this piece of shit.

33:07.416 --> 33:09.666
Fuck you and your whore mother!
Get off me, bitch!

33:09.750 --> 33:12.291
Shut up with your man bun.
Fucking barista bitch.

33:12.375 --> 33:14.333
-Take it easy.
-I'll fuck your mother in the face!

33:14.416 --> 33:16.875
Don't touch me! Fuck the BAC!
I'll fuck you up the ass.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.916
-Shut your trap!
-Fuck all you all. You ain't shit!

33:19.000 --> 33:21.208
-Fucking bunch of pigs. Shut up, I said.
-Shut up.

33:21.291 --> 33:23.125
Come on, you, with your old ass in front.

33:23.208 --> 33:24.458
-Whoa!
-Stupid-ass bitch!

33:24.541 --> 33:27.666
-I'll fuck you up. What you gonna do?
-Watch your mouth, you!

33:27.750 --> 33:30.708
Fucking dinosaur-looking bitch.
Throw me out, I don't give a shit.

33:30.791 --> 33:33.833
-Don't fucking touch me, I'm a minor.
-Shut your mouth.

33:33.916 --> 33:36.583
Let me outta here. I'm supposed to be
fucking your mom, fucking whore.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.125
I'll fuck your sister in the shower--

33:38.208 --> 33:41.250
-You got little dick syndrome in the back?
-Speed up, you pussy!

33:41.333 --> 33:43.750
Yass, put some music on.
I can't deal with this.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.666
-You're a bitch!
-Hurry up.

33:48.625 --> 33:50.583
-Shut up!
-Perfect. All right.

33:50.666 --> 33:53.666
Hey, turn it up. Turn it up!

33:56.083 --> 33:57.291
Yeah!

34:02.625 --> 34:03.625
Yeah!

34:03.708 --> 34:05.833
Listen to this guy in the back, huh?

34:10.125 --> 34:12.125
Watch you looking at.
Get you some, nephew.

34:15.833 --> 34:19.500
-Hurry up, driver. Go on, speed up.
-You're driving like an old man.

34:21.250 --> 34:23.166
-What? What?
-Let's go!

34:23.250 --> 34:25.458
Come on!

34:25.541 --> 34:29.333
Can you pick a lane already?
Maybe you need to get your eyes checked.

34:31.791 --> 34:34.708
Oh, smile. You love me!
You know you love me!

34:40.875 --> 34:41.875
Get on it!

34:43.208 --> 34:44.208
Yeah!

34:49.958 --> 34:52.125
Whoa!

34:53.833 --> 34:54.916
Oh yeah!

35:05.291 --> 35:07.500
Whoop, whoop,
that's the sound of the police!

35:09.708 --> 35:10.791
Motherfucker.

35:12.916 --> 35:14.666
-Good evening. Police.
-Yeah?

35:14.750 --> 35:16.791
What you bought back there,
give it here, please.

35:17.875 --> 35:19.500
Uh, it's just my personal stash.

35:19.583 --> 35:22.041
Oh, my friend. Don't start stuttering.
We saw you. Give it here.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.041
-It's all I have.
-That's all there is?

35:24.125 --> 35:24.958
It's all I have.

35:25.875 --> 35:28.125
-I swear.
-OK, I'll let you off this time. Go.

35:31.708 --> 35:33.833
Shit, I'd really love to go there.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.916
-Where?
-Outer space.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.666
-You wanna go to outer space?
-Well, yeah.

35:39.750 --> 35:40.875
Lifelong dream.

35:40.958 --> 35:43.583
People are starting to go there.
Tourists and everything.

35:43.666 --> 35:45.875
-Yeah, rich people.
-Oh, for sure.

35:47.250 --> 35:49.041
Still, just imagine seeing it.

35:50.166 --> 35:52.750
Our planet all small in the distance.
You feel me?

35:53.250 --> 35:55.000
-Crazy, no?
-Insane.

35:57.250 --> 35:58.583
You can see it all round.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.958
-What's your point?
-Normally, it's flat, not round.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.041
-Got ourselves a real astronomer.
-He's so stupid!

36:11.125 --> 36:14.458
Honestly, I wish I could go to outer space
so I wouldn't have to see your faces.

36:14.541 --> 36:16.208
Dumbass!

36:18.583 --> 36:20.458
Whoa, whoa, what's he doing?

36:21.416 --> 36:22.666
Fucking hell.

36:24.541 --> 36:27.250
What are you guys doing?
Hey, what are you doing?

36:27.333 --> 36:29.333
-What are you talking about?
-What do you mean?

36:29.416 --> 36:31.958
Fuck, you've been robbing my customers
for the last hour!

36:32.041 --> 36:34.125
-We're not doing anything.
-What do you mean?

36:34.208 --> 36:36.125
Been watching you.
Why you robbing my customers?

36:36.208 --> 36:38.666
What's going on? Where'd you come from?

36:38.750 --> 36:42.041
What gives you the right to come
to my place and fuck all my customers?

36:42.125 --> 36:44.583
-We didn't know this was your place.
-You didn't know?

36:44.666 --> 36:46.833
This is somebody's place, isn't it?
Don't talk like that.

36:46.916 --> 36:49.208
-Yeah?
-So, you're here to screw people over?

36:49.291 --> 36:50.583
-No.
-You son of a bitch!

36:50.666 --> 36:52.958
-Hey, don't talk like that.
-Fucking shit, huh?

36:53.041 --> 36:54.958
-"Don't talk like that."
-Don't get worked up.

36:55.041 --> 36:57.541
You come here, fuck me up the ass,
and I shouldn't get worked up?

36:57.625 --> 36:59.791
Don't shush me!

36:59.875 --> 37:02.666
-You're a bunch of thieves.
-Shut the fuck up!

37:02.750 --> 37:05.583
-Calm down, OK?
-You can't tell me what to do!

37:05.666 --> 37:07.500
-Whoa. Hey.
-What are you doing, huh?

37:07.583 --> 37:09.708
-Whoa!
-Don't tell me to get in the car!

37:09.791 --> 37:11.208
Put that thing away!

37:11.291 --> 37:14.125
-You think I'm scared of you?
-Back up. Lower your weapon.

37:14.208 --> 37:16.958
-Put it away. Lower your weapon.
-I'm not lowering my weapon. Fuck you!

37:17.041 --> 37:18.583
-Lower your weapon.
-You're fucking dead.

37:18.666 --> 37:20.750
-I said put that away!
-Get back in your car.

37:20.833 --> 37:23.083
You're on my turf!
You go home, you punk bitch!

37:23.166 --> 37:24.666
Go on. Lower your weapon.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.416
-You think you're bad, huh?
-I'll fuck you up!

37:28.500 --> 37:30.916
Your face looks familiar,
you son of a bitch.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.041
-You and I know each other, right?
-No.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.958
We don't? Go back to the police station,
fuck your mother, son of a bitch.

37:36.041 --> 37:38.083
They're pigs. Come on, let's bounce.

37:38.708 --> 37:40.250
-Crooked ass.
-Pigs.

37:40.333 --> 37:42.666
You're a bunch
of dirty motherfuckers!

37:43.166 --> 37:45.625
Earn your thousand euros a week, assholes!

37:45.708 --> 37:46.541
Slaves!

37:46.625 --> 37:51.625
-Go on, get in your Cayenne, motherfucker.
-I recognize you! See you soon!

37:56.000 --> 37:57.958
Are you crazy? You piece of shit!

37:58.041 --> 38:00.041
-What are you doing?
-What happens if they shoot?

38:00.125 --> 38:01.458
-What happens?
-Whoa!

38:01.541 --> 38:02.625
-What then?
-Calm down!

38:02.708 --> 38:05.333
-Huh? What happens?
-What the fuck is wrong with you?

38:05.416 --> 38:07.458
-Calm down from what? Fuck!
-Calm down!

38:07.541 --> 38:09.208
-It didn't go to shit.
-Your shitty plan!

38:09.291 --> 38:11.541
-Calm down.
-Fuck you, calm down!

38:13.000 --> 38:14.250
Hey, I have a family.

38:15.291 --> 38:16.583
You're acting like thugs!

38:19.083 --> 38:21.166
-And you with your shitty plans!
-Get in the car.

38:21.250 --> 38:23.500
Yeah, now we're thinking straight.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.166
-Good thing I--
-Shut your mouth!

38:39.791 --> 38:42.166
Get in the car. We're leaving.
Get in the car.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.958
Get in the fucking car, Antoine!

38:44.041 --> 38:45.500
You get in the car!

38:46.666 --> 38:48.791
I'm the only one with any balls here.

38:49.291 --> 38:50.291
Bunch of clowns.

38:58.208 --> 39:00.041
-Hello?
-You gotta get over here now.

39:00.125 --> 39:02.291
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Hang on, calm down. What?

39:02.375 --> 39:04.375
Yeah, I'm serious.
You gotta get the fuck over here.

39:04.458 --> 39:06.500
-I'm freaking the fuck out.
-OK. Where are you?

39:06.583 --> 39:07.541
I'm at the spot.

39:13.583 --> 39:16.833
-What's the matter?
-Are you stupid or something?

39:16.916 --> 39:20.416
What did you do at Square des Oliviers?
You're robbing people now?

39:21.916 --> 39:24.083
-Who told you that?
-Don't ask who told me.

39:24.166 --> 39:26.833
-Seriously. Did you or did you not?
-That's enough. Answer me.

39:26.916 --> 39:28.625
-Where'd you hear that?
-In my neighborhood.

39:28.708 --> 39:32.291
People talk. Are you mental? They talk.
Are you guys crazy or something?

39:33.083 --> 39:35.041
-I don't want to die.
-That's not your problem.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.291
-Stop saying it's not my problem.
-It's not your problem!

39:37.375 --> 39:39.291
-Did you see anything? No.
-What, are you psychic?

39:39.375 --> 39:40.875
-Are we being followed?
-Yes.

39:40.958 --> 39:42.958
I leave my place, I don't feel right.
It's fucked up.

39:43.041 --> 39:45.541
Everywhere people look at me,
I feel like they know me.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.625
People see us. People know us.

39:47.708 --> 39:51.208
-What do you mean following us?
-I feel like I'm being followed.

39:51.291 --> 39:54.208
There, Mr. Antoine, I feel like
I'm being followed when I leave my home.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.000
-By who? Where?
-Someone from the quarter.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.791
-Think they know about us?
-Of course.

39:57.875 --> 40:00.333
-People in your hood don't know me.
-Stop saying that.

40:00.416 --> 40:02.083
Are you part of the BAC, yes or no?

40:02.166 --> 40:03.666
-Are you part of the BAC?
-Yes.

40:03.750 --> 40:05.333
BAC south or BAC north?

40:05.416 --> 40:06.375
-BAC north?
-Yeah.

40:06.458 --> 40:07.333
-All right.
-So what?

40:07.416 --> 40:09.166
And where are we now? North quarter?

40:09.250 --> 40:11.208
People in my precinct know me,
no one in yours.

40:11.291 --> 40:13.708
They're only two minutes apart, right?

40:13.791 --> 40:14.666
Answer me!

40:14.750 --> 40:17.125
You've been in my neighborhood before,
right? People know you.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.250
Got any weed on you?

40:20.500 --> 40:22.375
I'm telling you,
you're spiraling out.

40:22.458 --> 40:24.625
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Hey!

40:24.708 --> 40:26.791
-Please, give it back. I'm not playing.
-Look at this.

40:26.875 --> 40:28.708
-Give it.
-This is all you need.

40:29.291 --> 40:31.125
-Here. You keep this.
-Oh, but you--

40:31.208 --> 40:32.875
Ease up on the weed. You're spiraling out.

40:32.958 --> 40:34.875
-Think I'm making it up?
-You're getting paranoid.

40:34.958 --> 40:37.666
-Yeah. Did you smoke before coming here?
-No, I didn't smoke.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.333
-Did you smoke before coming?
-No.

40:39.416 --> 40:42.458
Look at me. You're high.
You're just fucking with me here.

40:42.541 --> 40:43.541
I see you.

40:45.541 --> 40:46.458
Hey.

40:47.375 --> 40:50.250
What happened at the Oliviers,
it's nothing.

40:50.333 --> 40:52.458
Nobody cares. Changes nothing.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.083
Amel, go back home.

40:55.958 --> 40:57.583
Lay low. Let me handle the rest.

40:57.666 --> 40:59.291
-But…
-You got me or not?

41:01.416 --> 41:02.666
You're not in danger.

41:04.166 --> 41:05.041
You have my word.

41:05.833 --> 41:07.750
Why you touching my shoulder
like that, player?

41:07.833 --> 41:09.458
-Is this better?
-You're a flirt.

41:09.541 --> 41:11.083
-Oh yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

41:15.250 --> 41:17.666
Gonna be mad at each other
like this for much longer?

41:17.750 --> 41:20.916
Enough already. Get over it.
I dunno what you have to do to make peace.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.208
I'm tired of this shit.

41:24.958 --> 41:27.083
Did you seriously say, "Make peace"?

41:27.166 --> 41:29.416
What kind of stupid expression is that?

41:29.958 --> 41:32.500
"Let's make peace,"
says the BAC philosopher

41:32.583 --> 41:35.250
-What's so funny?
-You're the BAC philosopher now.

41:35.333 --> 41:38.458
-Peace it is, Mahatma fucking Ghandi.
-That's funny to you too?

41:40.166 --> 41:41.500
Your face makes me laugh.

41:41.583 --> 41:44.166
Calling all available cars,
requesting immediate backup.

41:44.250 --> 41:46.666
Priority. We're surrounded. Need backup.

41:47.375 --> 41:49.916
BAC17, this is TN13.
Confirm your location.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.333
Square des Oliviers!
I repeat, Square des Oliviers.

41:52.416 --> 41:53.875
Send people, shit! Hurry.

41:53.958 --> 41:56.666
TN13 to all available units
in the north sector.

41:56.750 --> 41:59.583
Officers in trouble
in the Square des Oliviers area.

41:59.666 --> 42:01.875
Respond to TN13 ASAP.

42:01.958 --> 42:03.125
Turn off the radio.

42:03.750 --> 42:05.166
-No!
-Turn it off!

42:05.750 --> 42:07.250
No way!

42:19.333 --> 42:21.791
-Fucking hell, where were you?
-We couldn't come.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.791
Sorry, you had something better to do?

42:24.875 --> 42:26.833
Shit! What kind of cop have you become?

42:26.916 --> 42:28.958
Leaving us to take a beating
without lifting a finger.

42:29.041 --> 42:32.083
-Don't lecture me.
-Got something you want to say to me?

42:33.208 --> 42:34.041
Pfft. Whatever.

42:34.958 --> 42:35.791
Jacques…

42:37.375 --> 42:39.000
Listen, I'm sorry. OK?

42:39.083 --> 42:42.000
I don't give a shit if you're sorry
or about your apology.

42:42.083 --> 42:43.916
-We almost got killed!
-Calm down.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.041
-Hey, I apologize.
-Fuck you, you son of a bitch!

42:48.041 --> 42:49.375
What? What

42:57.291 --> 42:58.541
I can explain, all right?

43:00.916 --> 43:05.208
We've been working nights for three weeks.
We've gathered about two kilos.

43:05.291 --> 43:08.875
But, Greg, you've been outed
in the northern neighborhoods.

43:08.958 --> 43:12.166
So you're gonna need to go downtown
together to collect the rest.

43:12.250 --> 43:14.166
And no more trouble. I'm serious.

43:14.250 --> 43:15.208
OK.

43:32.208 --> 43:33.708
Go on!

44:09.458 --> 44:10.666
Say you stole the bag!

44:40.791 --> 44:43.666
-Hey! Hey, whoa!
-Whoa!

44:51.583 --> 44:52.833
What is this shit?

44:54.541 --> 44:56.791
Tunisian designer.

44:56.875 --> 44:57.916
Couscous Chanel!

45:01.166 --> 45:02.666
Empty your pockets!

45:41.208 --> 45:42.833
You change diapers and everything?

45:42.916 --> 45:45.666
I looked it up online.
I couldn't figure it out in the beginning.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.083
What do you mean you looked it up?

45:47.166 --> 45:49.166
How to put on a diaper, man.
It's not that easy.

45:49.250 --> 45:50.750
-What, there are tutorials?
-Yeah.

45:50.833 --> 45:51.875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.041
And you like it?

45:54.750 --> 45:56.083
No, it smells like shit.

45:56.166 --> 45:58.708
It literally smells like shit. No lie.

45:58.791 --> 45:59.666
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.625
It's not all diapers.
I like the rest of it.

46:03.708 --> 46:04.791
Best part of my day.

46:06.208 --> 46:08.666
In any case, you make a good uncle.

46:12.291 --> 46:13.291
He's beautiful.

46:14.250 --> 46:17.375
He gets it all from his mother.
Thank God he looks like his mother.

46:21.500 --> 46:25.583
In three days, there's gonna be
a big shipment coming to the ghetto.

46:25.666 --> 46:27.083
In the apartment towers.

46:27.166 --> 46:28.958
All the bosses will be there.

46:30.291 --> 46:33.333
But just for one day. And then…

46:33.416 --> 46:35.250
-Three days?
-Yeah.

46:38.750 --> 46:40.625
-Which apartment tower?
-I don't know.

46:40.708 --> 46:43.166
Which block?
What do you mean you don't know?

46:43.250 --> 46:45.083
The only thing I can guarantee you

46:45.166 --> 46:47.166
is that they're so paranoid
about their dope,

46:47.250 --> 46:50.000
they're never gonna let a dealer
get caught with a full bag.

46:50.791 --> 46:55.000
Any sign of trouble, there's a guy nearby
whose job it is to pick up the bag,

46:55.083 --> 46:56.458
bring it to the safe house.

46:59.291 --> 47:01.000
Normally, if you follow the sack,

47:01.958 --> 47:04.041
it'll take you
to the apartment you're looking for.

47:18.166 --> 47:19.083
Did you hear me?

47:23.916 --> 47:25.041
Yeah, I heard you.

49:19.125 --> 49:20.875
There's a yellow vehicle approaching.

49:21.958 --> 49:23.833
A yellow vehicle is headed
toward the towers.

49:23.916 --> 49:25.916
I repeat, yellow vehicle
headed toward the towers.

49:28.541 --> 49:30.666
Yeah, I got eyes on it.

49:43.958 --> 49:46.375
There are two men with masks
searching the car.

49:53.708 --> 49:55.708
The car is headed for block M.

50:01.541 --> 50:04.791
I got eyes on the dealer.
Bandana covering his face, black cap.

50:04.875 --> 50:06.625
Some kind of drawing on his bag.

50:06.708 --> 50:10.125
I got eyes on the dealer, M block.
I repeat, eyes on the dealer.

50:17.458 --> 50:19.000
Transaction is complete.

50:25.875 --> 50:27.833
The dealer is posted up
in front of block M.

50:27.916 --> 50:30.791
I repeat, the dealer is posted up
in front of block M.

50:34.500 --> 50:36.166
All teams, standby for the ready.

50:36.666 --> 50:38.875
A reminder, do not apprehend.
Just tail them.

50:39.666 --> 50:41.583
We follow the bag
so we can find their stash.

50:41.666 --> 50:43.041
We locate the stash no matter what.

50:44.250 --> 50:45.333
OK. Roger that.

50:52.666 --> 50:54.625
-Antoine, do you read me?
-Yeah.

50:55.125 --> 50:56.208
OK, you're up, buddy.

50:56.291 --> 50:58.750
-The dealer is in front of block M.
-OK.

51:42.875 --> 51:44.125
You got that fire?

51:44.666 --> 51:46.875
Go to block C over there,
in front of the dumpsters.

51:52.416 --> 51:53.791
All teams, he's en route.

51:54.750 --> 51:55.708
Mount up.

52:09.333 --> 52:12.250
Our team has eyes on Antoine.
He's walking down the alley.

52:12.333 --> 52:14.916
He should come into your view
any moment now.

52:44.875 --> 52:46.500
Popo!

52:46.583 --> 52:49.500
Popo! Popo!

52:53.125 --> 52:56.041
Popo!

52:57.416 --> 52:59.625
Go, go, go, go, go. Let's go! Go!

53:06.791 --> 53:09.250
Come on.
Go, go, go, go! Let's go! Let's go!

53:31.000 --> 53:31.958
Whoa!

53:33.208 --> 53:35.041
Whoa! Hey, what's the matter?

53:35.125 --> 53:37.125
-Get back! I said get back!
-Hey, man.

53:37.208 --> 53:39.916
I said get back!

53:40.000 --> 53:41.166
Come on, man.

53:41.250 --> 53:43.083
Calm down! I said get back!

53:43.166 --> 53:44.916
-Get back!
-Those fuckers!

53:45.000 --> 53:46.875
Get back. Get back!

53:48.666 --> 53:50.750
Hey, Jacques. Blue T-shirt, black mask!

53:50.833 --> 53:52.083
Blue T-shirt, black mask.

53:52.166 --> 53:56.083
Blue T-shirt, black mask.
Blue T-shirt, black mask. Get back!

53:57.458 --> 54:00.375
Got it. I see him!
I got eyes. I got eyes!

54:03.250 --> 54:04.583
I'm following the bag!

54:05.291 --> 54:06.625
Block K16! Block K16!

54:09.625 --> 54:11.625
I'm going in. I'm going in!

54:15.958 --> 54:17.750
Get back!

54:36.333 --> 54:38.708
Stash house located. Fifth floor.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.583
Open up, you son of a bitch! Open up!

55:10.083 --> 55:10.916
Open up!

55:14.000 --> 55:15.416
Kill all these pigs!

55:20.250 --> 55:21.083
Open the door!

55:26.583 --> 55:29.916
Requesting immediate backup!
I repeat, requesting immediate backup!

55:30.000 --> 55:32.166
We have an officer trapped in block K16!

55:34.125 --> 55:36.666
Open the door. Open your door!

55:37.541 --> 55:40.416
-Hey, what are you doing? Get outta here!
-Sir! Sir!

55:40.500 --> 55:42.416
-What are you doing?
-Are you crazy or something?

55:42.500 --> 55:44.041
-Get out!
-OK!

55:44.125 --> 55:45.291
Stop!

55:46.208 --> 55:47.291
-Stay there.
-Sir!

55:47.833 --> 55:49.583
-He's in here!
-Shut your mouth!

55:49.666 --> 55:51.708
What'd we do?

55:51.791 --> 55:52.916
Move! Sit down. Quiet!

55:54.250 --> 55:58.041
Blocks 15 and 16 should connect
through the roofs. Let's go. Let's go!

55:58.125 --> 56:00.041
-Come on! Yeah!
-Both of us?

56:03.208 --> 56:04.583
Oh!

56:10.291 --> 56:13.541
Yass! Yass! Greg, Antoine are
on their way. Stay where you are!

56:13.625 --> 56:15.708
I'm on the sixth floor. Apartment 630.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.875
Please, sir.
We didn't do anything.

57:22.416 --> 57:23.541
Yass, we're coming.

57:23.625 --> 57:27.541
Apartment 630, sixth floor.
I repeat, apartment 630--

57:27.625 --> 57:28.750
Fuck!

57:41.583 --> 57:43.208
-You OK, bro?
-I'm OK.

57:43.291 --> 57:44.416
-Hey!
-I'm OK.

57:52.250 --> 57:53.833
Come on, let's go. Come on.

57:53.916 --> 57:55.666
God help us.

57:55.750 --> 57:58.291
What are you doing?
Get the fuck outta here!

58:00.666 --> 58:03.083
-Get back!
-Go ahead. Go on, shoot!

58:03.166 --> 58:05.666
-Go on, shoot! Go on, shoot. Come on!
-Get back!

58:05.750 --> 58:06.583
Shoot!

58:08.583 --> 58:09.500
Come on!

58:14.500 --> 58:15.500
On the right.

58:20.083 --> 58:21.291
Is that the door, Yass?

59:32.916 --> 59:34.000
Yass, cover me.

1:00:04.208 --> 1:00:05.250
-You OK?
-Yeah.

1:00:07.083 --> 1:00:08.541
Jacques…

1:00:09.250 --> 1:00:12.250
We're in another apartment,
still moving on the fifth floor.

1:00:12.333 --> 1:00:13.791
Hurry the fuck up. Hurry up!

1:00:23.625 --> 1:00:25.583
Get the fuck outta my neighborhood!

1:00:25.666 --> 1:00:27.916
Come on, guys. Go, go, go!

1:00:58.458 --> 1:01:00.291
Get the fuck outta here. Go!

1:01:13.125 --> 1:01:14.333
Go! Go!

1:01:14.875 --> 1:01:16.166
Hey, you!

1:01:16.250 --> 1:01:17.666
Put that down over there.

1:01:19.041 --> 1:01:20.041
Get on it!

1:01:20.875 --> 1:01:24.375
-Move it. Move it!
-Put it in the bag. Let's go!

1:01:24.458 --> 1:01:25.583
-Move!
-OK!

1:01:26.500 --> 1:01:28.583
-Get the bag.
-Let's go, let's go!

1:01:28.666 --> 1:01:30.500
Toss me that. Move! Move!

1:01:30.583 --> 1:01:32.625
-Go out there.
-Go, go!

1:01:33.666 --> 1:01:35.625
-We got you.
-Go, go!

1:01:35.708 --> 1:01:38.166
-Hurry up. Come on! Let's go.
-Go!

1:01:38.250 --> 1:01:40.875
-Toss it.
-Don't forget to flush!

1:01:40.958 --> 1:01:43.708
-Right there!
-Come on. Let's go!

1:01:43.791 --> 1:01:45.125
We gotta get outta here.

1:01:57.416 --> 1:02:01.416
-Move it! Move, let's go!
-The drugs are in the communal trash room.

1:02:03.791 --> 1:02:06.083
Yeah. What the fuck was that?

1:02:06.166 --> 1:02:08.375
-Shit! What the fuck?
-They're gassing us!

1:02:08.458 --> 1:02:10.875
-Get the fuck outta here!
-Move!

1:02:10.958 --> 1:02:14.625
Come on, let's get the fuck outta here!

1:02:19.333 --> 1:02:20.625
Get the fuck out!

1:02:44.416 --> 1:02:47.208
-Let's get outta here.
-Come on, run faster!

1:02:49.958 --> 1:02:52.333
Get against the wall!

1:03:01.625 --> 1:03:02.916
Get back! Get back!

1:03:23.083 --> 1:03:25.500
He's out! He's out! He's out!

1:03:28.625 --> 1:03:30.208
Don't move! Don't move!

1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:35.500
Don't move!

1:03:39.958 --> 1:03:41.375
They're here!

1:03:45.541 --> 1:03:48.375
-What we got here? Help me.
-You're under arrest!

1:03:48.458 --> 1:03:50.375
Don't move! Party's over, bro.

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:05.333
Get the fuck outta here!

1:04:07.375 --> 1:04:08.583
Shoot! Shoot him!

1:04:09.750 --> 1:04:12.625
Hey, get outta here now!
Get outta here! You, beat it!

1:04:15.250 --> 1:04:17.625
-Get the fuck outta here!
-Beat it!

1:04:17.708 --> 1:04:20.875
-Back up! Move it! Back the fuck up!
-Move! Move!

1:04:20.958 --> 1:04:22.958
-Move!
-Get back! Get back!

1:04:24.416 --> 1:04:26.250
Beat it! You, beat it!

1:04:26.333 --> 1:04:28.000
Back up! Back up!

1:04:33.791 --> 1:04:35.625
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:04:38.458 --> 1:04:41.791
-I'm gonna kill you, Pig!
-Drive, drive!

1:04:41.875 --> 1:04:44.875
Go! Oh shit! Move! Move!

1:04:47.958 --> 1:04:50.083
-What the fuck?
-Go! Go!

1:04:58.916 --> 1:05:00.583
This is fucking crazy!

1:05:08.750 --> 1:05:10.000
Drive, drive!

1:05:10.083 --> 1:05:12.125
-Fuck it, just drive!
-Go, go, go!

1:05:12.666 --> 1:05:13.750
Go, go, go!

1:05:16.958 --> 1:05:19.500
-Oh shit!
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:05:24.458 --> 1:05:26.208
Yass, you OK? You OK?

1:05:26.291 --> 1:05:27.666
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

1:05:27.750 --> 1:05:30.333
Don't stop, don't stop!
Go, go, go. Don't stop!

1:05:30.875 --> 1:05:32.083
Holy shit!

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:04.750
North BAC gets it done,
that's why!

1:06:05.541 --> 1:06:09.083
It's because of you that
we're the best gang task force in France!

1:06:09.166 --> 1:06:11.000
Yeah!

1:06:12.708 --> 1:06:14.416
You're all heroes, of course,

1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:16.125
and in your own way,

1:06:16.208 --> 1:06:18.916
but this fucking guy went in there
with balls this big!

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.708
Yass, don't ever do that again,
you fearless bastard!

1:06:25.750 --> 1:06:29.375
Eat, drink,
but go easy on the drugs tonight, OK?

1:06:35.166 --> 1:06:37.125
Yeah. Yeah!

1:06:37.208 --> 1:06:38.500
Thank you, Greg.

1:06:38.583 --> 1:06:41.291
Thank you.
We couldn't have done this without you.

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:47.041
Come on, let's have some fun. Yes!

1:06:52.125 --> 1:06:54.875
North BAC! North BAC!

1:06:54.958 --> 1:06:57.208
We're here because of you, brother.

1:06:57.291 --> 1:06:58.625
All you, brother.

1:06:59.875 --> 1:07:02.000
Nobody stabbed me in the back to get here.

1:07:05.166 --> 1:07:06.166
Yeah.

1:07:11.875 --> 1:07:12.750
Come on!

1:07:13.833 --> 1:07:14.875
I'm tired.

1:07:16.250 --> 1:07:17.291
But I'm happy!

1:07:30.041 --> 1:07:31.000
'Sup?

1:07:32.833 --> 1:07:33.833
Let's see…

1:07:35.333 --> 1:07:36.375
Boom!

1:07:40.250 --> 1:07:41.291
All good?

1:07:42.333 --> 1:07:43.416
Put it in your trunk?

1:07:58.208 --> 1:07:59.125
So it is.

1:08:01.291 --> 1:08:02.666
What are you gonna do?

1:08:03.166 --> 1:08:06.250
I'll probably smoke it all myself.

1:08:08.458 --> 1:08:09.833
Another life, I'd join you.

1:08:14.333 --> 1:08:16.250
So this is the end of the road.

1:08:17.625 --> 1:08:18.833
This is it, yeah.

1:08:20.583 --> 1:08:23.208
So you're finally getting rid of me.

1:08:27.041 --> 1:08:29.000
All right.

1:08:30.833 --> 1:08:32.166
Take care of yourself.

1:08:35.708 --> 1:08:36.625
Hey…

1:08:38.583 --> 1:08:39.791
See you around, Amel.

1:08:45.666 --> 1:08:46.750
Hey, Antoine…

1:08:48.208 --> 1:08:49.041
What?

1:08:50.208 --> 1:08:51.958
-Never mind, it's fine.
-What?

1:08:52.041 --> 1:08:53.958
Nothing, it's fine. Get outta here.

1:08:56.833 --> 1:08:59.375
Don't get fresh
or you'll end up in the water!

1:09:06.375 --> 1:09:08.916
Go on. Get out of here.

1:09:30.041 --> 1:09:32.541
TWO MONTHS LATER

1:09:43.416 --> 1:09:44.916
Hey, bubba.

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.166
Who's my little buddy? You my buddy?

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:48.375
We're buddies, right?

1:10:02.958 --> 1:10:04.541
-Sergeant Cerva?
-Yes.

1:10:05.208 --> 1:10:06.458
Lieutenant Vidal.

1:10:26.458 --> 1:10:27.625
What's going on?

1:10:28.291 --> 1:10:29.125
Yass?

1:10:30.666 --> 1:10:32.250
-Where's the baby?
-Inside.

1:10:32.916 --> 1:10:34.416
I'll call you when I'm done.

1:10:38.041 --> 1:10:40.250
What the hell is this mess?
Are you kidding?

1:10:40.333 --> 1:10:42.416
-You don't have to do this! Why?
-Hey, calm down.

1:10:42.500 --> 1:10:44.375
-Where's my son?
-Take it down a notch.

1:10:44.458 --> 1:10:47.958
Everything's fine. He's in the bedroom.
We need to check the cupboards.

1:10:50.708 --> 1:10:52.375
Emilien, check under the TV.

1:10:53.750 --> 1:10:54.583
Shit!

1:10:57.416 --> 1:10:59.083
Come, my love. Huh?

1:10:59.166 --> 1:11:00.625
-He's fine.
-Are you OK?

1:11:01.416 --> 1:11:02.458
Please leave.

1:11:04.583 --> 1:11:06.291
Are you OK, my love? Huh?

1:11:06.375 --> 1:11:08.458
-Go along the closets.
-Sweetie.

1:11:08.541 --> 1:11:09.875
Hey.

1:11:09.958 --> 1:11:11.125
Mommy's here now.

1:11:28.375 --> 1:11:30.166
I have to inform you
that this interview

1:11:30.250 --> 1:11:33.375
will be recorded on video
for further use in the investigation.

1:11:33.458 --> 1:11:36.875
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Lieutenant Yvon. IGPN.

1:11:36.958 --> 1:11:39.666
Great. What the hell am I doing here?
I'd like to know.

1:11:40.583 --> 1:11:42.041
Well, the charges are…

1:11:44.666 --> 1:11:45.500
…racketeering…

1:11:47.625 --> 1:11:49.083
…and organized drug trafficking.

1:11:53.166 --> 1:11:57.250
-Are you kidding? Is this a joke?
-No, I don't think it's a joke.

1:11:57.750 --> 1:12:00.791
Well? The cannabis,
who did you steal it from?

1:12:00.875 --> 1:12:02.000
We didn't steal it.

1:12:02.750 --> 1:12:04.500
-You didn't steal it?
-No.

1:12:04.583 --> 1:12:06.458
-We collected it.
-"Collected"?

1:12:08.708 --> 1:12:11.583
That's a nice way of putting it.
I like it. "Collected."

1:12:14.541 --> 1:12:16.000
Police exhibit number four.

1:12:18.125 --> 1:12:19.958
Kept a few sticks of cannabis
for yourself,

1:12:20.041 --> 1:12:22.375
which we found in your home, to get high?

1:12:23.666 --> 1:12:25.291
I smoke cannabis, yes.

1:12:25.916 --> 1:12:28.125
So, this is for your personal consumption?

1:12:28.208 --> 1:12:29.333
I just said so.

1:12:30.750 --> 1:12:31.708
Didn't you hear me?

1:12:31.791 --> 1:12:34.541
And, uh, how do you explain the presence

1:12:35.166 --> 1:12:36.291
of this scale?

1:12:38.291 --> 1:12:42.541
Do you know a lot of potheads
who weigh their dope? I don't know any.

1:12:43.916 --> 1:12:45.166
Only dealers do that.

1:12:45.958 --> 1:12:47.375
We never sold any drugs.

1:12:48.375 --> 1:12:50.458
-Never.
-You didn't sell any drugs.

1:12:50.541 --> 1:12:53.375
No. Drugs were our bargaining chip.
Drugs in exchange for information.

1:12:53.458 --> 1:12:55.416
-That's not what people are saying.
-Oh?

1:12:56.166 --> 1:12:58.041
Please tell me what people are saying.

1:12:58.125 --> 1:13:01.500
They say you confiscate drugs
then turn around and sell them.

1:13:03.375 --> 1:13:05.625
The drugs were used

1:13:05.708 --> 1:13:10.083
to pay the informant who told us
about the distributing apartment.

1:13:10.166 --> 1:13:13.125
An informant whose identity
is completely unknown to you.

1:13:13.208 --> 1:13:14.250
Only Antoine knows.

1:13:14.333 --> 1:13:17.875
The informant wanted to remain anonymous.
It's what they do. But you know that.

1:13:17.958 --> 1:13:19.041
Of course.

1:13:19.125 --> 1:13:20.375
I'm not telling you shit.

1:13:20.958 --> 1:13:23.500
-Zero.
-And for what reason are you refusing?

1:13:23.583 --> 1:13:24.666
You can't be serious?

1:13:24.750 --> 1:13:26.833
If I give you my informant,
that puts them at risk.

1:13:27.916 --> 1:13:30.833
-I promised to keep them anonymous.
-Yes, of course.

1:13:30.916 --> 1:13:33.583
You gave your word so you're keeping it.
You're not a snitch.

1:13:33.666 --> 1:13:35.375
-Is that it?
-Exactly, that's it.

1:13:36.333 --> 1:13:37.583
That's how thugs operate.

1:13:39.375 --> 1:13:40.583
Go fuck yourself.

1:13:41.166 --> 1:13:43.208
I didn't catch the informant's name.

1:13:43.291 --> 1:13:46.125
I'm not telling you anything.
There are ethics to being a cop.

1:13:46.208 --> 1:13:48.708
-Oh.
-You don't look like you have any. Huh?

1:13:50.583 --> 1:13:52.458
Trying to take down your colleagues.

1:13:52.541 --> 1:13:53.625
You have a child?

1:13:54.875 --> 1:13:57.291
-Yeah.
-Some things are understandable.

1:13:57.375 --> 1:14:00.166
When you have a kid, 1,800 euros a month…

1:14:00.250 --> 1:14:03.208
-Risking your life every day.
-What are you trying to say?

1:14:03.291 --> 1:14:05.375
I think that the drugs,

1:14:05.458 --> 1:14:08.208
you sold them because you need help
making ends meet.

1:14:08.291 --> 1:14:10.208
Quit talking out of your ass
with your bullshit!

1:14:10.291 --> 1:14:13.125
Why are you bringing my son into this
with that shitty condescending tone?

1:14:13.208 --> 1:14:15.625
-You need help making ends meet--
-Think you're better than me?

1:14:15.708 --> 1:14:18.500
-Anyone could understand.
-You think you're better?

1:14:20.958 --> 1:14:23.125
-You think I'm dirty, don't you?
-No.

1:14:23.208 --> 1:14:25.958
If you want me not to think that,
you have to give me something.

1:14:26.458 --> 1:14:28.666
Quit looking at me like that. OK?

1:14:29.333 --> 1:14:31.166
You quit looking at me like that.

1:14:31.250 --> 1:14:33.333
-I've been doing this job 20 years.
-Yeah?

1:14:33.416 --> 1:14:35.750
OK? Think you're
on the right side of the desk?

1:14:35.833 --> 1:14:38.041
You think you know everything,
but you don't!

1:14:38.125 --> 1:14:39.833
-I'm doing my job.
-You don't know anything!

1:14:39.916 --> 1:14:42.750
You don't know what we went through,
don't know the northern sector!

1:14:42.833 --> 1:14:45.916
You've never set foot there!
You're just a fucking bureaucrat!

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.125
-You should--
-We almost died out there!

1:14:48.208 --> 1:14:50.166
-You should calm down.
-Seen the poverty out there?

1:14:50.250 --> 1:14:52.291
You ain't seen nothing!
Get down from that high horse.

1:14:52.375 --> 1:14:54.791
-I'm giving you a piece of advice.
-Don't take that tone. Fuck.

1:14:54.875 --> 1:14:56.708
-I'm giving you… Calm down!
-Shut up!

1:14:56.791 --> 1:14:57.875
-Shut your mouth!
-Calm down.

1:14:57.958 --> 1:15:01.625
-I ask the questions, you answer them!
-I'm done talking to you! I'm done!

1:15:01.708 --> 1:15:04.541
-Then who will you talk to?
-You want to lock me up, huh?

1:15:04.625 --> 1:15:07.041
That way you can meet your quota,
you puny little man!

1:15:07.125 --> 1:15:11.375
I know this story by heart. I know it by
heart! You wanna meet your quota!

1:15:11.458 --> 1:15:14.458
-There! I'm done talking to you.
-Calm down! Calm down.

1:15:14.541 --> 1:15:17.291
-It's pointless. You're just an asshole!
-It's in your best interest.

1:15:17.375 --> 1:15:19.916
Go fuck yourself!
Now I wanna talk to my superior.

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:22.916
I wanna talk to Jérôme!
I'm not saying another word!

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.375
You're not talking to anyone!
We already talked to your superior.

1:15:26.458 --> 1:15:29.166
Know what? Jérôme doesn't know
anything about your informant!

1:15:29.250 --> 1:15:30.875
-You made it up!
-Oh, he doesn't?

1:15:30.958 --> 1:15:34.041
Hey, moron. You imbecile!
My superior is my friend!

1:15:34.125 --> 1:15:36.750
We did this mission together!
He gave the order!

1:15:36.833 --> 1:15:38.208
-Oh, right!
-You're fucked!

1:15:38.291 --> 1:15:39.500
You are fucked!

1:15:39.583 --> 1:15:41.916
-You should be careful with your friends.
-I'm done talking!

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000
I want an audience
with the prosecutor's office, and Jérôme!

1:15:45.083 --> 1:15:46.000
Keep going.

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:49.125
I'm done talking to you!
I'm done talking! Go fuck yourself!

1:15:49.208 --> 1:15:50.625
-You better control yourself!
-Hey!

1:15:50.708 --> 1:15:53.416
-Take care of him.
-You should be ashamed!

1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:55.875
-Cuff him.
-You don't know? You know what we did?

1:15:55.958 --> 1:15:57.791
You're nothing now! Nothing!

1:16:27.833 --> 1:16:29.208
Please have a seat.

1:16:30.041 --> 1:16:31.291
Hello, Your Honor.

1:16:32.125 --> 1:16:33.083
So…

1:16:34.041 --> 1:16:37.500
We're here at the request of the accused,
Grégory Cerva.

1:16:37.583 --> 1:16:41.000
He asked to be heard in your presence,
Mr. Jérôme Bodin,

1:16:41.083 --> 1:16:44.041
head of the anti-criminal brigade
of the northern sector.

1:16:45.583 --> 1:16:49.166
Mr. Bodin, while exercising
your duties as an officer,

1:16:49.250 --> 1:16:53.291
were you aware of an operation
being carried out at night by this team,

1:16:53.375 --> 1:16:56.375
in order to collect
various amounts of cannabis hash?

1:16:57.166 --> 1:16:58.291
No, I was not aware.

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000
I'll remind you that you are under oath.

1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:06.458
-Do you confirm?
-I confirm.

1:17:06.541 --> 1:17:08.708
-Jérôme, what are you doing?
-No, Mr. Cerva.

1:17:08.791 --> 1:17:11.333
-What are you doing?
-Mr. Cerva! Mr. Cerva!

1:17:12.666 --> 1:17:14.625
You'll be able
to have your say in due time.

1:17:14.708 --> 1:17:16.708
I'll remind you that you are under oath.

1:17:19.083 --> 1:17:20.958
-Do you confirm?
-I confirm.

1:17:22.708 --> 1:17:25.333
You never heard
about this collecting of drugs?

1:17:25.416 --> 1:17:26.375
Never.

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.500
Is it possible
that without your knowledge,

1:17:29.583 --> 1:17:32.583
this collecting was used
to pay an informant for information

1:17:32.666 --> 1:17:35.416
used in the operation
that led to the dismantling

1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:37.875
of the drug trafficking network
in question?

1:17:38.791 --> 1:17:40.166
It's… It's possible.

1:17:43.333 --> 1:17:44.833
But I was not aware of it.

1:17:47.541 --> 1:17:48.666
Mr. Cerva,

1:17:48.750 --> 1:17:51.916
you claim that your chain of command
was aware of your actions?

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.166
Absolutely.

1:17:54.250 --> 1:17:58.583
You claim that your superior,
present here, had approved your actions?

1:17:58.666 --> 1:17:59.500
Yes.

1:18:01.083 --> 1:18:03.333
Careful now,
is this a direct accusation?

1:18:03.416 --> 1:18:04.250
Yes.

1:18:05.541 --> 1:18:08.000
Do you have
any evidence to present to me?

1:18:10.458 --> 1:18:11.291
No.

1:18:13.041 --> 1:18:13.875
No.

1:18:19.083 --> 1:18:22.416
Thank you, gentlemen.
Mr. Bodin, you may leave.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:23.958
Thank you.

1:18:34.125 --> 1:18:37.625
You'll be in solitary confinement
during your provisional detention.

1:18:37.708 --> 1:18:40.291
Until the investigation's over.

1:18:40.375 --> 1:18:43.333
You can call your family
in one month. Not before.

1:18:44.041 --> 1:18:45.875
No contact with other inmates.

1:18:45.958 --> 1:18:47.333
It's for your own safety.

1:18:48.083 --> 1:18:50.083
You don't have a lot of friends in here.

1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.291
Turn to the left.

1:19:00.750 --> 1:19:03.125
Fuck your mother!
Dirty fucking cop!

1:19:03.208 --> 1:19:05.833
Come over here,
son of a bitch! Bitch!

1:19:06.875 --> 1:19:10.583
We're gonna get you!
We're gonna get your ass!

1:19:10.666 --> 1:19:12.875
-You're dirty!
-Stop here.

1:19:12.958 --> 1:19:16.291
We're gonna get you.
We'll get you, scumbag!

1:19:16.375 --> 1:19:17.916
Fucking crook!

1:19:20.708 --> 1:19:23.333
The only person
you'll communicate with is the guard.

1:19:23.416 --> 1:19:25.375
The only way to call him is this.

1:19:26.375 --> 1:19:28.291
We're gonna come for you!

1:19:51.916 --> 1:19:53.583
Hello. Yes. It's just that…

1:19:53.666 --> 1:19:56.958
-What do you want?
-It's just that I need to see you now.

1:19:57.041 --> 1:19:59.500
Not now.
We'll deal with it tomorrow.

1:19:59.583 --> 1:20:01.750
No, it's just
that I need to talk to my captain.

1:20:29.041 --> 1:20:32.458
It's as simple as cutting
out the backbone and roasting it flat.

1:20:32.541 --> 1:20:35.500
Don't bother talking to me.
You hear? That's--

1:20:39.041 --> 1:20:42.958
Good evening. In tonight's headlines,
a scandal with the Marseille police.

1:20:43.041 --> 1:20:46.250
Three BAC employees are suspected
of corruption and extortion.

1:20:46.333 --> 1:20:48.958
They allegedly sold drugs
that had been recovered from thugs

1:20:49.041 --> 1:20:50.291
in exchange for services.

1:20:50.375 --> 1:20:51.791
For several months now,

1:20:51.875 --> 1:20:54.208
investigators had installed microphones
in their vehicles.

1:20:54.291 --> 1:20:57.208
The recorded conversations
don't leave much room for doubt,

1:20:57.291 --> 1:20:58.666
according to the prosecutor.

1:20:58.750 --> 1:21:01.916
This is the unit in charge
of recovering drugs from dealers

1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.583
and counterfeit cigarettes
from street vendors.

1:21:04.666 --> 1:21:08.750
I will be, as I have had the opportunity
to be in other situations,

1:21:08.833 --> 1:21:12.208
extremely strict regarding these men.

1:21:12.291 --> 1:21:15.458
There is no room
for those who defile the police

1:21:16.291 --> 1:21:17.541
and the Republic.

1:21:17.625 --> 1:21:21.000
Everyone must know
that we will take the strictest…

1:21:21.083 --> 1:21:21.916
Guard!

1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:23.291
…possible measures.

1:21:25.041 --> 1:21:28.416
Every time the north BAC
is involved in a procedure, in a case,

1:21:28.500 --> 1:21:30.250
there will be an underlying doubt,

1:21:30.333 --> 1:21:32.666
according to many lawyers
of the Marseille bar.

1:21:32.750 --> 1:21:36.375
And these lawyers are not excluding
requesting release for clients

1:21:36.458 --> 1:21:37.625
who had been brought in

1:21:37.708 --> 1:21:41.916
by these north BAC policemen at the time,
and who are currently incarcerated.

1:21:43.125 --> 1:21:44.375
Today,

1:21:44.458 --> 1:21:48.125
I sense great distress
amongst the population.

1:21:49.125 --> 1:21:52.333
Minister, do you have a plan
for placing this type of unit

1:21:52.416 --> 1:21:55.583
under stricter
and more efficient surveillance?

1:21:57.625 --> 1:21:59.416
Having to directly fight thugs

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:01.625
requires that much more restraint

1:22:01.708 --> 1:22:04.291
and a sense of republican values.

1:22:04.375 --> 1:22:06.791
And a police officer
who doesn't respect the law

1:22:06.875 --> 1:22:09.000
and the code of ethics of the police

1:22:09.083 --> 1:22:12.000
defiles the uniform and has no place
in Marseille's police…

1:22:12.083 --> 1:22:13.166
Answer me!

1:22:14.125 --> 1:22:16.625
Hey! Answer me!

1:22:16.708 --> 1:22:18.000
Answer me!

1:22:18.083 --> 1:22:19.750
Dammit, answer me!

1:22:20.250 --> 1:22:22.500
-Hey! Hey!
-Thank you.

1:22:22.583 --> 1:22:25.458
-That's a form of corruption.
-Hey! Answer me!

1:22:25.541 --> 1:22:29.208
Most concerning is civil servants seem
to have lost their moral standards.

1:22:30.208 --> 1:22:33.625
The justice department
speaks of a broad criminal investigation

1:22:33.708 --> 1:22:36.833
that's only just getting started.
If the facts are confirmed,

1:22:36.916 --> 1:22:40.458
the police officers could be sentenced
to up to 20 years in prison.

1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:42.708
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1:22:42.791 --> 1:22:45.125
Your family gives you money
for the commissary?

1:22:45.208 --> 1:22:46.291
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-OK.

1:22:46.833 --> 1:22:49.833
Listen, I know I'm your lawyer,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

1:22:50.333 --> 1:22:51.875
So far, our defense is frail.

1:22:51.958 --> 1:22:53.291
We don't have much.

1:22:53.375 --> 1:22:56.916
Your problem is that everyone's
gotten involved with this business.

1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.083
The prefect, the mayor,

1:22:59.166 --> 1:23:01.166
the reporters and the minister too.

1:23:01.875 --> 1:23:03.708
You hear the minister the other day?

1:23:04.208 --> 1:23:06.791
If there's to be a chance
of getting you outta here,

1:23:08.291 --> 1:23:10.208
I need the name of that informant.

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.333
No, I can't do that.

1:23:21.125 --> 1:23:22.041
Think about it.

1:23:24.333 --> 1:23:25.375
I can't do that.

1:23:43.416 --> 1:23:44.416
What do you want?

1:23:44.500 --> 1:23:47.333
Ah, my hand really hurts.
I can't even move it.

1:23:47.416 --> 1:23:51.583
-I want to go back to the infirmary.
-Not now. You were there this morning.

1:23:54.125 --> 1:23:57.625
OK. Um, do you know
if my lawyer spoke with my superior?

1:23:57.708 --> 1:24:00.333
-They were meant to meet this morning.
-You're not the only one here.

1:24:00.416 --> 1:24:02.583
You know I got no business being in here.

1:24:03.458 --> 1:24:06.666
-Your colleagues must've explained?
-Stop. I don't need…

1:24:06.750 --> 1:24:08.250
-Know what I need?
-Quit talking to me.

1:24:08.333 --> 1:24:10.958
-I need you to call my superior.
-Get some rest. Sleep.

1:24:11.041 --> 1:24:13.125
-Call him, please.
-I said get some rest!

1:24:13.208 --> 1:24:15.625
-I don't have time to chat.
-I know, but it's for…

1:24:16.333 --> 1:24:17.541
Cerva, stop it!

1:24:17.625 --> 1:24:18.708
Stop it!

1:24:20.375 --> 1:24:22.791
-No, no!
-You asshole. Get it now?

1:24:23.291 --> 1:24:24.541
-Ow!
-Get it?

1:24:24.625 --> 1:24:28.208
I want to see my superior, asshole!
I want to see my superior!

1:24:28.291 --> 1:24:31.041
I want to see my superior!

1:24:31.125 --> 1:24:33.208
I want to talk to my superior!

1:24:34.916 --> 1:24:37.083
I need to talk! I need to talk!

1:24:38.125 --> 1:24:41.833
-I need to talk!
-Hey! What are you doing? Hey, guard!

1:24:41.916 --> 1:24:45.333
I need to talk! I need to talk!

1:24:49.250 --> 1:24:51.458
I need to fucking talk!

1:24:54.875 --> 1:24:56.541
I need to talk!

1:24:57.083 --> 1:24:59.250
I need to fucking talk!

1:24:59.333 --> 1:25:01.875
I need to talk! I need to talk!

1:25:09.916 --> 1:25:13.875
Hi, you've reached Yass and Nora.
We're not home. Leave us a message.

1:25:13.958 --> 1:25:15.291
Yeah, honey, it's me.

1:25:16.291 --> 1:25:17.625
Uh, hope that…

1:25:18.791 --> 1:25:19.791
that you're OK.

1:25:21.333 --> 1:25:22.958
I wanted to call you, so I…

1:25:26.583 --> 1:25:27.416
Uh…

1:25:29.416 --> 1:25:30.416
And Malik, uh…

1:25:42.750 --> 1:25:45.000
Here.
We pitched in what we could.

1:25:46.125 --> 1:25:49.333
I'm touched, but I don't want it.
I want help.

1:25:49.416 --> 1:25:50.833
Yeah, of course. Tell us.

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:53.458
You guys collected drugs too.

1:25:55.125 --> 1:25:57.583
You need to say something,
tell Internal Affairs.

1:25:57.666 --> 1:26:00.125
It can change this.
It'll give some weight to their version.

1:26:00.208 --> 1:26:03.750
It won't, Nora. It's just gonna put
the three of us in the slammer with them.

1:26:03.833 --> 1:26:05.708
What do you expect from us here?

1:26:05.791 --> 1:26:09.375
They didn't rat you out. They took it all.
They said nothing. Even Greg.

1:26:09.458 --> 1:26:12.041
They'll jump all over us, Nora,
put us in prison.

1:26:12.125 --> 1:26:16.125
You know that if you tell Internal Affairs
that you were there, that Jérôme knew,

1:26:16.208 --> 1:26:18.541
if you tell them what happened
those nights--

1:26:18.625 --> 1:26:20.750
Jérôme did his job. He saved the brigade.

1:26:21.416 --> 1:26:24.583
The ministry's gonna save its own ass
and the police's reputation.

1:26:24.666 --> 1:26:27.416
Greg, Antoine, and Yass
don't mean anything to them.

1:26:27.500 --> 1:26:29.000
Same goes for us if we speak out.

1:26:29.083 --> 1:26:32.000
Know what we're dealing with?
I'm talking five to ten years.

1:26:32.750 --> 1:26:34.958
The lawyer told me, Jacques. He told me.

1:26:38.250 --> 1:26:39.333
I'm begging you.

1:26:45.291 --> 1:26:47.375
What do I tell him? What do I tell Malik?

1:26:47.916 --> 1:26:50.958
I swear, if I could've done something,
I would've done it.

1:26:52.250 --> 1:26:53.416
I have a daughter too.

1:26:55.250 --> 1:26:57.083
Your son could just as well be mine.

1:26:58.583 --> 1:27:00.041
You can't ask me to do this.

1:27:01.083 --> 1:27:02.208
I'm sorry, Nora.

1:27:17.875 --> 1:27:19.083
How are you feeling?

1:27:20.666 --> 1:27:21.708
I'm OK.

1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:25.708
It's kinda annoying. The Jacuzzi
broke down. Apart from that, I'm good.

1:27:29.208 --> 1:27:30.291
It's hard in here.

1:27:33.416 --> 1:27:34.666
You're alone with yourself.

1:27:37.541 --> 1:27:38.958
How's my little man doing?

1:27:39.458 --> 1:27:44.000
Good. Good. He laughs all the time.
I talk to him. They say that's important.

1:27:44.791 --> 1:27:47.458
-I tell him stories.
-What do you say to him?

1:27:49.041 --> 1:27:51.666
-That you're coming home.
-Of course I'm coming home.

1:27:59.791 --> 1:28:01.333
Did you talk to the others?

1:28:02.416 --> 1:28:04.625
Kevin, Jacques… did you talk to them?

1:28:06.541 --> 1:28:07.541
Tell me.

1:28:15.666 --> 1:28:16.750
They won't speak out.

1:28:17.583 --> 1:28:19.000
No.

1:28:24.583 --> 1:28:26.000
-Oh.
-I'm sorry.

1:28:26.083 --> 1:28:27.208
No, it's nothing.

1:28:28.125 --> 1:28:30.000
It happens to me too.

1:28:32.833 --> 1:28:34.000
Malik and I are here.

1:28:34.083 --> 1:28:36.791
Even if we have to wait 112 winters,
we're here.

1:28:36.875 --> 1:28:38.375
I'm here too.

1:28:38.458 --> 1:28:39.833
I'm not going anywhere.

1:28:40.625 --> 1:28:43.000
I'm afraid I don't have a choice.

1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:44.958
I fucking love you.

1:28:48.291 --> 1:28:49.958
-Go on.
-You're my life.

1:28:50.041 --> 1:28:51.625
-You're my life.
-You too.

1:28:54.375 --> 1:28:56.625
-Come on. We gotta go.
-Yeah, I got it, chief.

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:31.166
I'M NOT DEAD

1:30:02.625 --> 1:30:03.708
I'd like a tablet.

1:30:04.375 --> 1:30:07.000
We've been giving you tons of tablets.
It's ridiculous.

1:30:08.250 --> 1:30:09.125
Come on.

1:30:10.708 --> 1:30:12.166
Come on. Try to get up.

1:30:12.250 --> 1:30:14.041
Come on. Come on.

1:30:39.333 --> 1:30:40.291
Hey, bro!

1:30:41.625 --> 1:30:42.458
Hey!

1:30:43.208 --> 1:30:45.333
-Hey!
-This way, come on. Let's go.

1:30:45.416 --> 1:30:46.375
Greg!

1:30:46.458 --> 1:30:48.916
Your cell! Shut up!
Now you're pissing me off!

1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:50.500
-Come on!
-Hey!

1:30:50.583 --> 1:30:52.250
-What the fuck? It's me!
-Move it!

1:30:52.333 --> 1:30:54.375
-Hey, what did you do to him?
-Move it!

1:30:55.125 --> 1:30:56.833
OK.

1:30:57.875 --> 1:30:58.875
OK, stop.

1:31:16.833 --> 1:31:18.333
I need to get my hair cut.

1:31:19.750 --> 1:31:22.708
Only inmates can cut other inmates' hair.
It's the law.

1:31:22.791 --> 1:31:23.625
I know.

1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:26.916
I can't leave you in the hands
of just any inmate.

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.000
Yeah, I know.

1:31:30.333 --> 1:31:33.875
-You don't think I see you coming?
-I just wanna get my hair cut.

1:31:34.375 --> 1:31:36.375
You can't refuse me that. It's my right.

1:31:41.625 --> 1:31:43.666
I don't wanna hear
a word out of you.

1:31:43.750 --> 1:31:44.750
Got it, chief.

1:32:18.125 --> 1:32:18.958
Chief?

1:32:21.666 --> 1:32:22.875
If you had a friend

1:32:23.666 --> 1:32:26.291
who was losing his mind…

1:32:27.791 --> 1:32:29.125
you'd save him, right?

1:32:29.208 --> 1:32:30.750
I said "not one word."

1:32:31.333 --> 1:32:33.000
I'm talking to you, not him.

1:32:34.041 --> 1:32:36.125
-So, what would you do?
-Shut up.

1:32:36.833 --> 1:32:39.000
-But what would you do?
-Shut up.

1:32:39.083 --> 1:32:40.458
You'd save him, right?

1:32:40.541 --> 1:32:43.000
Would you save him,
or would you let him die like a dog?

1:32:43.083 --> 1:32:45.250
Hey, I saw Greg and he's not there. Fuck!

1:32:45.333 --> 1:32:47.541
Wake up! Wake up now!

1:32:47.625 --> 1:32:49.458
-Do what you have to do.
-Shut up!

1:32:49.541 --> 1:32:51.958
Do what you have to do! Fuck!
He's dying in here!

1:32:52.041 --> 1:32:54.791
-Careful!
-Wake up! Wake up!

1:32:54.875 --> 1:32:55.833
Shut up!

1:34:11.375 --> 1:34:12.458
Is that her?

1:34:13.958 --> 1:34:14.916
Yeah, it's her.

1:34:31.750 --> 1:34:33.000
I didn't have a choice.

1:34:38.458 --> 1:34:39.500
I'm so sorry.

1:35:01.583 --> 1:35:04.875
After confirming
the existence of this informant,

1:35:04.958 --> 1:35:09.166
the prosecutor has decided to drop
the charges of organized drug trafficking.

1:35:10.041 --> 1:35:13.291
Therefore, I am going
to end your provisional detention.

1:35:13.375 --> 1:35:14.666
You'll be getting out.

1:35:15.500 --> 1:35:18.916
There are still charges against you.
Namely, violating the civil code

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:22.083
and taking illegal actions
in the performance of your duties.

1:35:22.166 --> 1:35:25.750
You will have to submit to certain
release conditions before your trial.

1:35:25.833 --> 1:35:26.875
Is that clear?

1:35:29.500 --> 1:35:30.500
Where's my dog?

1:37:45.416 --> 1:37:48.166
YASS IS NOW WITH THE POLICE UNION.

1:37:48.250 --> 1:37:51.083
HE DEFENDS HIS COLLEAGUES
AGAINST MANAGEMENT.

1:38:00.958 --> 1:38:03.958
ANTOINE TURNED HIS BADGE IN.

1:38:04.041 --> 1:38:07.666
HE WORKS AS A PRISON NURSE
LOOKING AFTER INMATES.

1:38:21.791 --> 1:38:24.291
GREG WAS REMOVED FROM THE POLICE FORCE.

1:38:24.375 --> 1:38:29.041
HE IS NOW A MUNICIPAL OFFICER.
