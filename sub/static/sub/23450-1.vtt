And I'll be right here

Collins.

03:40.578 --> 03:43.081
- Coy.
- Here.

03:48.086 --> 03:50.672
Rain every day now for a week.

03:50.755 --> 03:53.174
I used to like the rain when I was a kid...

03:53.383 --> 03:55.677
even when it rained hard like now.

03:55.385 --> 03:58.555
My last fight outdoors, it rained.
Slowed me up a lot.

03:58.680 --> 04:02.976
One of the most beautiful ladies I ever knew,
I met in the rain.

04:03.059 --> 04:05.770
High heels on wet pavement.

04:05.353 --> 04:08.481
Hey. Here's your last look at Frank.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.569
They don't waste much time, do they?

04:12.694 --> 04:17.866
♪ Today they're gonna bury Frankie McLain ♪

04:17.991 --> 04:22.579
♪ No more aches and no more pain ♪

04:22.662 --> 04:26.791
♪ The good Lord
he treated Frankie very fine ♪

04:26.958 --> 04:31.796
♪He let him out
before he finished his time ♪♪

04:31.963 --> 04:35.174
Well, gentlemen,
that's one way of getting sprung.

04:36.092 --> 04:37.176
Maybe he's better off.

04:37.969 --> 04:39.762
I didn't think that even Captain Munsey...

04:39.762 --> 04:42.181
would put a 62-year-old man
to work in the drainpipe.

04:42.974 --> 04:45.768
Yeah, another dead guy,
compliments of Captain Munsey.

04:45.894 --> 04:48.396
Always on tap.
There he is now.

04:48.396 --> 04:50.273
Joe. It's Joe with him.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.985
Too bad about McLain.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.780
You and he were good friends,
weren't you, Collins?

05:38.863 --> 05:42.700
Frankie only had about eight months left to do,
didn't he, Captain?

05:42.575 --> 05:46.663
Knowing McLain,
out in eight months, back in nine.

05:46.788 --> 05:49.165
Right, Collins?

05:49.290 --> 05:51.167
Still carrying a grudge, eh?

05:51.292 --> 05:53.503
Lay off, Munsey.

05:53.586 --> 05:57.090
No, not Munsey. Sir.

05:57.173 --> 05:59.676
Sir.

05:59.801 --> 06:02.887
You won't even meet me halfway,
will you, Collins?

06:02.595 --> 06:05.098
Ten days in solitary
haven't taught you a thing.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.684
I bet it taught him
not to carry a shiv anymore.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.978
Or do you still claim that knife
was planted on ya?

06:10.269 --> 06:12.981
Never mind that.
The episode's closed.

06:14.482 --> 06:16.567
Collins.

06:16.484 --> 06:18.903
Why keep on fighting?

06:18.486 --> 06:21.489
After all, I've got a job to do. I...

06:24.492 --> 06:26.995
Very well. Have it your way.

06:39.799 --> 06:43.094
- Joe.
- Doc.

06:43.302 --> 06:46.305
Joe, I meant to come down
and visit you, but I, uh...

06:46.889 --> 06:48.307
Yeah.

06:52.770 --> 06:55.189
Dr. Walters.

06:55.398 --> 06:57.984
There's a meeting this morning.

06:58.109 --> 07:00.278
You'd better get straightened out.

07:00.403 --> 07:02.196
And the same to you.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.794
Me ol' friend Joe
was in the hole

07:17.003 --> 07:20.381
And it was worse than
where they're diggin' coal

07:20.882 --> 07:24.302
He comes out holding
very high his head

07:24.385 --> 07:29.307
And the man to blame
soon be very dead

07:31.100 --> 07:34.187
- Joe.
- How are you, Joe?

07:38.691 --> 07:42.278
- Good to see ya, Joe.
- I'm glad you're back.

07:43.905 --> 07:45.698
Heard from the wife?

07:48.409 --> 07:50.286
Joe, you know Kid Coy.

07:50.411 --> 07:52.288
Seen him around.

07:52.413 --> 07:54.874
They moved him
into Frankie McLain's place.

07:57.001 --> 08:00.296
Frankie was tops,
a hard guy to follow.

08:00.296 --> 08:02.215
Whatever you say, Joe.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.306
About the stool pigeon, Joe...
We made arrangements.

08:10.515 --> 08:13.101
Everything's okay.

08:12.517 --> 08:14.477
Everything's okay?

08:16.104 --> 08:17.980
What's okay?

08:19.107 --> 08:21.109
Nothing's okay.

08:21.317 --> 08:23.694
It never was, and it never will be.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.780
Not till we're out.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.782
You get that?

08:27.907 --> 08:29.909
Out.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.592
Joe. After solitary,
even this will taste good.

08:47.802 --> 08:52.098
- Thanks.
- Had a long talk with my mouthpiece yesterday.

08:51.514 --> 08:54.308
Your lawyer came all the way from New York
just to give you advice?

08:54.684 --> 08:57.186
Nah, ain't you heard?
He's right here in stir too.

09:02.692 --> 09:05.903
Roberts, I need a little help.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.197
- Get away from me.
- But you're in with Gallagher.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.199
Please.

09:10.283 --> 09:14.203
Roberts, you know Gallagher
can fix anything.

09:13.619 --> 09:16.205
There are some things
that just can't be fixed.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.083
Roberts, if you could put in a word for me...

09:23.713 --> 09:26.007
- Gallagher, I gotta talk to you.
- What's he want, Louie?

09:26.090 --> 09:27.592
- Blow.
- You gotta listen to me.

09:27.717 --> 09:29.302
- I said blow.
- They'll kill me.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.388
- Who is he?
- Wilson. He's here on a 529.

09:33.014 --> 09:35.016
Also a stool pigeon.
He planted the shiv on Collins.

09:35.099 --> 09:37.393
Munsey made me do it. Honest.

09:38.019 --> 09:39.395
You can fix anything, Gallagher.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.023
If you can call off Collins, I'd pay. I'd...

09:42.106 --> 09:44.025
You'll pay.

10:12.094 --> 10:16.224
Hello, Roberts.
How's that cold coming along?

10:16.307 --> 10:18.309
Fine...

10:18.392 --> 10:20.394
sir.

10:24.815 --> 10:27.818
- Hello, Daniels.
- Morning, sir.

10:30.029 --> 10:33.407
Strella, they tell me you're pressuring
some of the inmates in your area.

10:33.616 --> 10:35.618
Am I?

10:35.618 --> 10:37.620
Captain Munsey, sir,
I've gotta talk to you.

10:37.703 --> 10:40.414
Please, sir. Please.

10:45.127 --> 10:47.004
- Good morning, boys.
- Morning, sir.

10:48.714 --> 10:52.218
- Oh, good morning, Gallagher.
- Morning, Captain.

10:52.301 --> 10:57.598
I understand you're responsible for
settling that little feud over in cell block "J."

10:57.723 --> 10:59.725
We appreciate your assistance
of course, but...

10:59.809 --> 11:02.228
The boys and I were only trying to help.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.814
You and your boys.

11:04.897 --> 11:09.318
There's a very old bylaw in this institution
about gangs or cliques.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.904
We don't like them.
We don't want them.

11:12.113 --> 11:14.031
Why don't you break them up, Captain?

11:15.324 --> 11:18.828
Gallagher, when are you gonna remember
that you're not back home...

11:18.911 --> 11:21.122
running a gang of hoodlums?

11:21.330 --> 11:23.124
Let me be the policeman, eh?

11:23.207 --> 11:25.293
You just serve your time.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.421
And that way, we'll both get paid off.

11:28.796 --> 11:30.423
That's right, Captain.

11:30.506 --> 11:33.301
Like the Book says, we always get
what's coming to us.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.429
All of us.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.813
- Oh, excuse me, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

11:46.022 --> 11:47.815
Wasn't his fault.

11:55.531 --> 11:57.325
Sorry, Lister.

12:11.297 --> 12:14.008
♪ Ah, the warden's breakfast
ready and made ♪

12:14.133 --> 12:18.721
♪ with the ham and eggs and the marmalade ♪

12:25.436 --> 12:29.815
Sounds like a very important meeting
you're going to this morning, Doc.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.700
Is, uh, Captain Munsey gonna be there?

12:39.825 --> 12:42.411
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

12:46.707 --> 12:49.001
Brandy's the very best
drink in the world

12:49.210 --> 12:52.505
If you drink enough
your toes get curled

12:54.924 --> 12:56.634
Calypso, statistics show...

12:57.426 --> 13:01.013
that if the level of alcohol in the blood
exceeds one half of one percent...

13:01.013 --> 13:04.809
the blood pressure is affected,
a cerebral condition occurs...

13:04.809 --> 13:08.229
and then... you're cockeyed.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.818
And maybe that's the way it should be.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.833
You don't like this place, Doc.

13:28.916 --> 13:30.835
What for you stay here?

13:30.835 --> 13:33.921
You haven't got much choice, Calypso.

13:34.004 --> 13:35.923
Neither have I.

13:39.718 --> 13:45.307
But it's not as easy as all that,
Mr. McCallum. This prison...

13:45.307 --> 13:48.727
This prison has almost twice as many men
as it was built to accommodate.

13:48.811 --> 13:51.021
There's not enough work
to keep the inmates occupied.

13:51.147 --> 13:53.023
Why not?

13:53.107 --> 13:54.942
The world we live in.

13:55.109 --> 13:59.029
Yes, we can give them real work,
teach them trades, produce things.

13:58.737 --> 14:02.324
But the civilian manufacturer
says we're competing with him.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.535
Trade unions say we're putting
their people out of work.

14:05.536 --> 14:07.037
Nobody wants to help.
Not us.

14:07.121 --> 14:11.333
Manufacturers, unions.
You might as well blame the weather.

14:11.333 --> 14:15.045
What you're really saying is
you can't handle the situation.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.842
Excuse me, sir.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.845
I don't think you quite understood
what the warden meant.

14:22.928 --> 14:27.516
It's not only a matter of controlling the men.
He wants to help them.

14:26.849 --> 14:30.728
Munsey, what this prison needs
is absolute discipline...

14:30.936 --> 14:32.813
not charity.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.815
Your loyalty to the warden
doesn't change the fact...

14:34.940 --> 14:37.026
that he may be getting
too old for his job.

14:37.151 --> 14:41.238
Age, Mr. McCallum,
is a matter of arteries, not years.

14:41.238 --> 14:44.742
It's a pity, Walters, you're a better philosopher
than you are a doctor.

14:44.825 --> 14:47.036
But I'm getting tired of you in both roles.

14:47.119 --> 14:51.332
I was sent here today for one reason...
to tell you that if there's any more trouble...

14:50.831 --> 14:53.334
if this prison isn't brought under
the strictest control...

14:53.334 --> 14:57.546
- Mr. McCallum...
- There will be an immediate change
in practically all personnel.

14:57.630 --> 15:01.342
We don't want to be bothered anymore.

15:01.550 --> 15:03.344
Is that clear, Warden?

15:04.929 --> 15:06.847
Yes, sir.

15:06.931 --> 15:10.643
- Clear to you, Doctor?
- Oh, absolutely.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.853
You can't be bothered.

15:13.020 --> 15:16.148
Well, that simplifies everything.

15:17.441 --> 15:22.154
The great public and its servants.

15:22.238 --> 15:24.823
You put up prisons, thick walls...

15:24.823 --> 15:28.619
and then your job is over, finished.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.622
But is it over?

15:32.248 --> 15:34.333
You and your patent medicine remedies.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.418
Change the warden.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.838
New personnel.
Absolute discipline.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.049
Do you know what this prison is,
Mr. McCallum?

15:42.216 --> 15:44.134
One big human bomb.

15:44.218 --> 15:48.055
And you say, kick it and it'll be quiet.
Smash it and it won't explode.

15:48.138 --> 15:52.434
Munsey, what do you think
of the doctor's viewpoint?

15:51.934 --> 15:55.938
I think, sir, that on occasion,
the doctor becomes unduly alarmed.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.148
Warden?

15:59.233 --> 16:00.651
Uh, I don't... I don't know.

16:03.028 --> 16:06.156
I do. Like so many dreamers
and drunkards...

16:06.240 --> 16:08.534
the doctor's emotional words are empty.

16:08.617 --> 16:10.536
What's your solution?

16:10.619 --> 16:12.621
All I know is that when people are sick...

16:13.038 --> 16:14.623
you don't cure them
by making them sicker.

16:14.832 --> 16:17.042
By your methods,
we send the man back to society...

16:17.126 --> 16:19.628
a worse criminal than he was
when they sent him to us.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.132
Platitudes, Doctor.
I'm waiting for your solution.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.343
For men like you, Mr. McCallum,
there will never be any solution.

16:26.343 --> 16:29.847
- Wait a minute, Walters!
- Not while you wanna destroy instead of build.

16:29.930 --> 16:33.434
What we need here is a little more patience
and much more understanding.

16:33.559 --> 16:35.936
We've been patient too long.

16:36.020 --> 16:38.355
And as for understanding...

16:38.439 --> 16:41.942
I'm positive the purpose of my visit
cannot be misunderstood.

16:42.026 --> 16:45.654
You'll remain here, Warden,
only as long as there's no further trouble.

16:46.530 --> 16:47.656
Good day.

16:50.034 --> 16:52.036
Doctor.

16:54.038 --> 16:55.956
I'll see you to the gate, sir.

17:06.550 --> 17:09.261
I've been warden here
for such a long time.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.642
I wouldn't know where to go...

17:15.934 --> 17:18.145
what to do.

17:21.357 --> 17:23.733
- The place looks so nice now.
- Oh, that's swell.

17:23.733 --> 17:28.446
- I got flower drapes and big chairs...
- The boy doesn't know anything about it.

17:28.530 --> 17:30.532
- Fine, fine.
- And if he did...

17:34.453 --> 17:37.956
- She loves to come to see you.
- It's good she's so young.

17:37.956 --> 17:40.125
She thinks it's such fun, like a holiday.

17:43.045 --> 17:45.130
Over there. Your attorney.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.345
- Ruth?
- She won't go through with it.

17:50.928 --> 17:54.556
- But she's got to.
- I've had three different doctors to see her.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.143
They've all tried to explain how
important an operation is, right away.

17:57.851 --> 18:01.355
But she keeps saying no,
not unless you're there.

18:01.438 --> 18:03.357
Nothing matters to Ruth without you, Joe.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.859
Not even her life.

18:05.943 --> 18:07.945
How long has she got?

18:08.028 --> 18:09.947
I don't know.

18:10.030 --> 18:12.032
Let me tell her you're here.

18:12.032 --> 18:14.159
- No.
- She loves you, Joe.

18:14.243 --> 18:17.037
- She'll understand.
- No.

18:17.246 --> 18:19.665
Okay. I guess you know
what you're doing.

18:19.665 --> 18:23.752
Go back and talk to her. Try to make her
go through with it. Keep tryin'.

18:23.961 --> 18:26.255
- All right, Joe.
- Wait.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.843
- Get some cash. Keep it in your office.
- What are you going to do?

18:30.968 --> 18:34.054
There's not much I can do, is there?

18:41.270 --> 18:43.564
I'm not trying to interfere.

18:43.647 --> 18:47.651
I'm just saying that if you send Roberts
back to the drainpipe, I won't...

18:48.652 --> 18:50.362
All right, Munsey, have it your way.

18:57.661 --> 18:59.538
- Doc.
- Joe.

18:59.663 --> 19:02.040
They letting you run around loose?

19:02.249 --> 19:04.543
I'm waitin' to be reclassified.

19:04.668 --> 19:06.962
Munsey'll find another job for me.
He always has.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.673
Well, sit down.
Be with you in a second.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.259
Glad you dropped in.

19:12.342 --> 19:16.346
A patient of mine, old Pat Regan,
wants to see you.

19:16.346 --> 19:19.266
There's a pass to the infirmary
right there on the table.

19:22.561 --> 19:23.771
Thanks.

19:25.439 --> 19:27.941
- Doc.
- Yeah?

19:28.066 --> 19:30.569
How quick will cancer kill somebody?

19:30.736 --> 19:33.363
Well, that's the wrong way
to put the question.

19:33.447 --> 19:37.367
These days, cancer doesn't
have to mean death at all. Why?

19:37.451 --> 19:40.746
Well, uh, how about
if they have to operate?

19:41.371 --> 19:43.749
Even so, it depends entirely on the case.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.043
The important thing, of course,
is the time element.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.048
- Somebody close?
- Yeah.

19:51.048 --> 19:53.050
By the way, what time is it?

19:53.258 --> 19:56.053
- About 10:30.
- Are you sure?

19:56.178 --> 19:59.973
To be exact, it's 10:27.

20:00.057 --> 20:01.975
Why?

20:26.166 --> 20:28.168
Wilson, 10:30.

20:38.178 --> 20:40.055
Wilson, 10:30.

20:47.354 --> 20:49.356
Wilson, 10:30.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.866
Did I ever tell you about
that last limousine of mine?

20:59.449 --> 21:00.868
Beautiful... and roomy.

21:01.285 --> 21:04.454
Listen, that car was so long, when I picked up
the phone to talk to the chauffeur...

21:04.663 --> 21:06.748
I had to call long-distance.

21:06.748 --> 21:09.751
Strangely enough,
had this same number on it.

21:10.085 --> 21:12.045
Keep movin'.

21:13.463 --> 21:15.549
Wilson, 10:30.

21:19.386 --> 21:21.471
Wilson, 10:30.

21:38.071 --> 21:41.783
- Where are you goin'?
- Just to get a drink, Wilson.

21:53.462 --> 21:55.589
Hey!

23:01.154 --> 23:03.156
Help! Help!

23:09.788 --> 23:12.082
He made me do it!
He made me do it!

23:12.082 --> 23:15.794
No, don't! Stay away from me!
Captain Munsey made me do it!

23:15.877 --> 23:17.879
You guys would have
done the same thing!

23:18.380 --> 23:20.173
Please!

23:33.687 --> 23:35.772
Dr. Walters.

23:35.897 --> 23:39.359
Yes, Warden.
What?

23:39.359 --> 23:41.486
Yes, yes. I'll be right over.

23:41.695 --> 23:43.864
Warden, when did it happen?

23:44.865 --> 23:46.783
I see.

23:48.785 --> 23:51.663
- A prisoner just killed.
- Yeah?

23:51.663 --> 23:55.083
Well, this is one rap they can't
hang on you, Collins.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.670
I'm your witness.

23:58.795 --> 24:01.089
Important thing, witnesses.

24:02.174 --> 24:06.094
Lucky you asked me before
exactly what time it was.

24:06.887 --> 24:07.888
Yeah, wasn't it?

24:08.889 --> 24:09.890
A fella named Wilson.

24:10.682 --> 24:13.268
Tough break.
Accident?

24:13.393 --> 24:16.396
Positively.
Witnesses.

24:33.288 --> 24:35.082
- Hey, Louie.
- Yeah?

24:37.793 --> 24:39.669
A human interest story.

24:39.795 --> 24:43.173
Remember that terrific third baseman,
got paroled a couple of years ago?

24:43.090 --> 24:45.383
- Dougherty?
- He'll be back for the book.

24:45.467 --> 24:47.469
just knocked off his old lady.

24:47.594 --> 24:50.180
You don't say.
just shows you a guy don't think.

24:50.180 --> 24:54.768
If he'd done it last year, we might have beat
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.

25:05.403 --> 25:09.366
If you'd asked my advice about Wilson,
I'd have said, "Don't do it."

25:09.491 --> 25:11.284
Maybe that's why nobody asked you.

25:11.368 --> 25:13.286
It'll only make things tougher
for everybody else.

25:13.370 --> 25:16.289
- I don't care about everybody else.
- That's cemetery talk.

25:16.373 --> 25:18.291
Why not? We're buried, ain't we?

25:18.375 --> 25:20.377
Only thing is, we ain't dead.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.671
What's on your mind?

25:25.882 --> 25:28.301
You and me... out.

25:29.886 --> 25:33.181
They told me you had the fever ever since
the day you got here.

25:33.306 --> 25:36.685
- I thought you had more sense.
- No lectures. Just yes or no.

25:36.768 --> 25:40.188
Look, Collins, cons respect me.
So does the warden.

25:40.272 --> 25:43.608
I've had a good setup here
because I've tried to help both sides.

25:43.692 --> 25:45.485
- And I never crossed either.
- So what?

25:45.610 --> 25:47.904
So, in spite of Munsey,
I'm still number one.

25:49.781 --> 25:51.908
I've been here six years.

25:51.992 --> 25:55.787
Know how many propositions I've had
to crack the wall?

25:55.203 --> 25:57.581
Six thousand.

25:58.498 --> 26:00.292
They're on tap all the time.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.794
- Look, Gallagher...
- Wait a minute.

26:02.878 --> 26:05.505
See this fella at the Linotype machine?

26:05.589 --> 26:07.507
He's a lifer. Done 12.

26:09.509 --> 26:10.886
Come on.

26:11.803 --> 26:14.389
- Crenshaw.
- Yeah?

26:14.472 --> 26:17.392
- You know Collins. He's okay.
- Sure.

26:17.475 --> 26:19.477
How's the plan?

26:20.604 --> 26:22.981
If there's no hitch, we go Tuesday.

26:23.273 --> 26:25.400
- You in, boss?
- No. Good luck.

26:25.483 --> 26:27.485
It's all set this time.

26:31.698 --> 26:35.202
It's been all set every Tuesday for 12 years.

26:37.287 --> 26:40.790
And 12 years from now,
it'll still be next Tuesday.

26:41.875 --> 26:45.587
Look, Gallagher,
I know this drum's full of crackpots.

26:45.795 --> 26:48.715
One con's gonna buy his way out.
Another knows the governor's cousin.

26:48.715 --> 26:51.885
A third guy's even gonna float out
in a homemade balloon.

26:51.301 --> 26:53.511
But I'm not buyin' any pipe dreams.

26:55.305 --> 26:58.808
It can be done. It's been done before,
and it'll be done again.

26:58.892 --> 27:00.894
It can be done here... by us.

27:00.977 --> 27:02.896
By you and me.

27:03.104 --> 27:05.982
Collins, if I ever put in with anybody,
it'll be with you.

27:08.276 --> 27:10.695
There's no need for that now.

27:10.779 --> 27:13.490
You I can tell why.

27:13.615 --> 27:15.700
Promised me my parole.

27:16.785 --> 27:19.079
Very soon now,
I'll be walking out of here.

27:22.791 --> 27:25.418
- Next Tuesday?
- Could be next...

27:26.586 --> 27:28.505
So long, Gallagher.

27:49.609 --> 27:51.820
White tie and tails
for the movie tonight

27:51.903 --> 27:54.781
The boy gets the girl
and that's all right

27:54.906 --> 27:57.909
It is too.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.288
Check... mate.

28:02.205 --> 28:04.582
Clip you again, soldier?

28:04.291 --> 28:07.002
Yeah, chess, dominoes,
whatever we play.

28:07.002 --> 28:09.296
- Don't you ever lose?
- Very seldom, friend.

28:09.421 --> 28:13.008
I was born with what
you might call the golden touch.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.302
I almost won the Golden Gloves once.

28:15.385 --> 28:18.722
They gave me a watch
and a robe with my name on the back.

28:18.722 --> 28:20.598
My girl was there... Henrietta.

28:20.682 --> 28:22.892
I'll be in the infirmary.
I gotta see a guy.

28:23.393 --> 28:25.603
- Still figurin'?
- Still.

28:25.812 --> 28:28.315
Save me a seat at the movie.
Take it easy, lady.

28:33.194 --> 28:37.699
Hey, what goes between you guys
and this dame?

28:37.824 --> 28:41.494
Watch your language, my unromantic friend.
You're speaking of a lady.

28:41.703 --> 28:44.205
It's enough to give somebody the creeps.

28:44.414 --> 28:48.918
You fellas smilin' at a picture, throwin' kisses
at her. You might think she was real.

28:49.002 --> 28:52.422
She is.
After a while, you'll get to know it too.

28:52.505 --> 28:57.093
It's true.
To me, she looks exactly like...

28:57.719 --> 29:00.013
- Like my wife.
- Yeah.

29:00.096 --> 29:04.017
That's no ordinary pinup girl.
To each one of us, she's somebody special.

29:04.100 --> 29:07.395
You mean if I keep lookin' at her
long enough like you fellas...

29:07.520 --> 29:09.397
she'll begin to remind me of Henrietta?

29:09.522 --> 29:11.524
That's right.

29:14.402 --> 29:16.404
But Henrietta's a blonde.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.490
She don't look nothin' like her.

29:18.615 --> 29:20.408
She doesn't have to.

29:20.617 --> 29:23.620
Our calendar girl is just an inspiration,
Brother Coy.

29:23.703 --> 29:26.915
She starts you thinking
about the one you really wanna see.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.001
For example,
the last couple of days now...

29:30.126 --> 29:32.420
she's had me thinking about Flossie.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.299
I never told you gentlemen
about Flossie, did I?

29:36.424 --> 29:40.929
To me, she's all the women I ever knew...

29:41.012 --> 29:43.598
and a few I hope I haven't met yet.

29:44.599 --> 29:49.312
I ran into Flossie one night
in Eddie's Place in Miami.

29:49.396 --> 29:53.316
I had just sold a trusting gentleman
a few shares in a radium mine...

29:53.400 --> 29:55.819
and I was trying to parlay my luck.

29:55.902 --> 29:57.821
I had only met Flossie that afternoon...

29:57.904 --> 30:00.698
but we were already very good friends.

30:00.824 --> 30:03.118
The dice were hot,
and she kept them that way.

30:03.326 --> 30:05.412
I was heading for a fortune.

30:05.620 --> 30:08.832
Suddenly, just when everything
was sunshine and roses...

30:08.915 --> 30:11.292
I heard the old familiar noises.

30:11.418 --> 30:14.421
Leave it to the police
to break up a wonderful evening.

30:14.712 --> 30:18.299
It looked as though everybody
was caught with their chips down.

30:18.425 --> 30:21.803
The raid didn't worry me, but the gun
I was carrying was a problem.

30:22.095 --> 30:24.514
So Flossie had me slip the gun
into her purse.

30:24.431 --> 30:28.726
She was not only beautiful,
she knew the score as well.

30:28.935 --> 30:32.105
Furthermore, she knew precisely
how to guide me through a back exit.

30:32.397 --> 30:34.315
Obviously, the girl was no tourist.

30:34.399 --> 30:37.610
My car was waiting there
just as pretty as you please.

30:37.735 --> 30:41.906
And with my money and my gun still safe,
off we drove.

30:42.115 --> 30:45.201
Driving along with such
a dream doll beside me...

30:45.827 --> 30:47.912
I figured myself a pretty lucky guy.

30:47.996 --> 30:51.499
Flossie had looks, brains
and all the accessories.

30:51.499 --> 30:54.127
She was better than a deck with six aces.

30:54.210 --> 30:58.131
But I regret to report that she also
knew how to handle a gun...

30:58.214 --> 31:00.216
my gun.

31:00.925 --> 31:04.220
Before, I had only suspected
that she was talented.

31:03.428 --> 31:05.805
Now I was positive.

31:05.805 --> 31:08.725
I didn't do much talking because,
for once in my life...

31:08.808 --> 31:11.102
I couldn't find the right words.

31:11.227 --> 31:15.023
She wanted all the money I had won,
and I never refuse a lady...

31:15.106 --> 31:17.025
especially when she's armed.

31:17.108 --> 31:20.236
Accordingly, I stepped out
of the automobile...

31:21.112 --> 31:22.822
without any arguments whatsoever.

31:23.031 --> 31:24.908
And that, gentlemen...

31:25.033 --> 31:29.037
was the last I ever saw
of my car, my cash...

31:29.120 --> 31:31.039
or my Flossie.

31:32.123 --> 31:34.334
I wonder who Flossie's fleecing now.

31:41.132 --> 31:43.134
I don't get it.

31:43.134 --> 31:46.137
Why would a guy want to hang on
to a memory like that?

31:46.221 --> 31:49.724
Who knows?
I guess when you're on the inside...

31:49.807 --> 31:53.520
even the phony things on the outside
seem wonderful.

31:53.603 --> 31:57.315
just so they happened on the outside.

32:05.114 --> 32:07.116
All right. Go ahead.

32:10.203 --> 32:12.539
Joe, how's the boy?

32:12.539 --> 32:14.541
Hello, Johnny.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.228
Regan.

32:35.812 --> 32:37.730
It's me. Collins.

32:42.944 --> 32:44.946
Where have you been?

32:46.030 --> 32:49.242
All day long I've been askin' for you.

32:50.827 --> 32:55.123
Frankie McLain...
he died in the next bed.

32:56.207 --> 32:59.127
He gave me a message for you.

33:01.129 --> 33:02.630
Drainpipe got Frankie.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.632
Same as me.

33:04.716 --> 33:07.635
But in that same drainpipe...

33:07.719 --> 33:09.721
there's a way out of this place.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.645
Go ahead.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.647
He said...

33:19.731 --> 33:25.528
"Ask Soldier how, in the war,
they took Hill...

33:25.612 --> 33:27.530
Hill ..."

33:44.714 --> 33:46.633
633?

33:49.427 --> 33:52.221
Joe...

33:52.430 --> 33:57.644
you... just gotta get in that drainpipe.

33:57.727 --> 33:59.729
You gotta, Joe.

34:06.736 --> 34:09.112
Oh, wait till Mr. Henty sees these.

34:09.237 --> 34:12.449
I'll bet you he'll give us the biggest
egg contract in the county.

34:12.533 --> 34:15.953
Oh! Do we have to name them all?

34:16.036 --> 34:18.539
Well, they're not pets, you know.
They're our stock-in-trade.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.750
If they don't get jammed
under the brooder and smother...

34:20.833 --> 34:22.918
or drown in the drinking fountain
or get coccidiosis...

34:23.043 --> 34:26.422
or peck each other to death, we...
we may be in the chicken business yet.

34:26.547 --> 34:30.051
After you've fed
and watered them every three hours...

34:30.051 --> 34:32.637
which you have to do until they can
take care of themselves...

34:32.637 --> 34:36.014
you won't feel so sentimental
about 'em.

34:35.431 --> 34:38.351
- Where's Tom?
- Stayed in the cell.

34:38.434 --> 34:41.228
- Another letter to his wife.
- Oh.

35:32.947 --> 35:35.158
- Hello, honey.
- Hello.

35:36.159 --> 35:38.745
- Be with you in a minute.
- No, take your time.

35:38.745 --> 35:40.747
Anything new?

35:40.830 --> 35:42.832
Around here?

35:44.250 --> 35:47.128
I ran into Harry Thomas
and his wife today.

35:47.253 --> 35:50.339
Thought it'd be a good idea to get together,
maybe sometime soon.

35:52.258 --> 35:54.635
You mean we might be
going out for a change?

35:58.055 --> 36:02.351
Honey, make a wish.

36:02.643 --> 36:04.645
What are you talking about?

36:11.027 --> 36:12.862
Tom!

36:13.946 --> 36:15.865
Oh, Tom, darling.

36:15.948 --> 36:18.034
Here, put it on.

36:19.660 --> 36:22.163
It's beautiful.

36:22.246 --> 36:25.041
It's the most beautiful thing
in the whole world.

36:29.962 --> 36:31.964
It belongs on you.

36:33.341 --> 36:36.344
It makes me feel so...

36:36.844 --> 36:40.264
I don't know.
Like I was somebody.

36:43.851 --> 36:45.853
Oh, Tom.

36:48.648 --> 36:50.650
Where'd you get it?

36:51.859 --> 36:53.736
Where'd the money come from?

36:53.861 --> 36:55.738
Where'd you get it?

36:55.863 --> 36:57.949
Cora, I stole the money.

36:58.032 --> 37:01.369
I juggled the books and took $3,000.

37:01.452 --> 37:04.330
You? You stole?

37:05.456 --> 37:07.333
- Why?
- Darling, the way we were going...

37:07.333 --> 37:10.253
you wanting things,
things you oughta have...

37:10.336 --> 37:12.338
and me strapped all the time...

37:13.464 --> 37:15.967
we were heading for a split-up.

37:16.050 --> 37:19.053
Don't you see?
I just had to do it.

37:21.055 --> 37:25.142
All my life, the one thing I really wanted
was a fur coat.

37:27.770 --> 37:31.649
- I can't give it up. I won't, Tom.
- No, darling.

37:31.732 --> 37:34.735
- But what if something should happen?
- Nothing that happens could matter...

37:35.862 --> 37:38.155
unless I lost you.

37:57.842 --> 38:00.636
- Evening, Tom.
- Hello, Captain.

38:00.761 --> 38:03.848
Sorry about that little incident
this morning.

38:04.056 --> 38:05.766
Those things happen, you know.

38:05.975 --> 38:09.645
- Yes, sir.
- Cigarette?

38:13.274 --> 38:18.070
Tom, you're no hoodlum
like the others in this cell.

38:17.570 --> 38:19.864
Why protect them?

38:19.947 --> 38:21.949
We've been over that before, Captain.

38:22.074 --> 38:26.370
Before, you didn't need my help
as much as you do now.

38:25.661 --> 38:28.372
I'm in a position
to make things easier for you.

38:28.539 --> 38:30.666
Like you did for Wilson?

38:30.750 --> 38:32.543
Wilson was careless.

38:32.668 --> 38:34.962
Careless people have accidents.

38:42.970 --> 38:46.265
I get quite a kick out of censoring the mail.

38:46.349 --> 38:49.769
All these letters you write home,
for example...

38:49.852 --> 38:51.771
and the answers you never get.

38:51.771 --> 38:55.942
Please, Captain,
let me alone.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.278
She's the most important thing
in the world to you, isn't she?

39:01.155 --> 39:03.950
Well, you'll come up for parole soon...

39:04.075 --> 39:06.160
if your conduct's good.

39:08.663 --> 39:11.249
I'm the one that decides that.

39:11.374 --> 39:15.378
I'm the only one who can help you.
No one else.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.967
Captain, I'm a cheap thief.

39:20.675 --> 39:22.969
I know I'm a failure...

39:23.052 --> 39:25.471
but I'm not an informer.

39:27.348 --> 39:29.642
That's what I like to see in a man...

39:29.767 --> 39:32.353
stability, fidelity.

39:33.771 --> 39:36.065
You're right, Lister.
We're both wasting our time.

39:37.942 --> 39:41.654
Me by talking to you
and, uh, you by writing to your wife.

39:42.655 --> 39:45.866
- Captain, you've heard from her.
- By mail this morning.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.452
Please. Please, Captain, tell me.

39:49.453 --> 39:51.080
In a way, Tom, you're a free man.

39:51.247 --> 39:53.165
She's divorcing you.

40:29.452 --> 40:35.374
just a minute.
just a minute. Sit down.

40:38.085 --> 40:40.254
The warden's going to talk to you.

40:40.379 --> 40:42.256
All ready, Warden.

40:43.257 --> 40:45.885
Men, I'm going to try to talk
some sense to you.

40:45.968 --> 40:48.554
I'm gonna lay it right on the line.

40:48.763 --> 40:51.182
There has been, in recent weeks,
a mounting unrest in this prison.

40:51.265 --> 40:53.559
Don't think for one minute
that I don't know about it.

40:53.768 --> 40:57.772
Up to now, you've enjoyed
the regulation privileges.

40:57.772 --> 41:00.775
However, if you persist
in fighting among yourselves...

41:00.775 --> 41:04.278
antagonizing the guards
and making way for accidents...

41:04.361 --> 41:07.782
like the one that happened
in the machine shop this morning...

41:07.865 --> 41:12.369
Then all your privileges will be revoked at once.

41:12.453 --> 41:14.872
Be careful of your associates.

41:15.081 --> 41:18.959
Always remember that one bad prisoner
can spoil things for the rest of you.

41:19.168 --> 41:20.961
So watch your step.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.255
It's up to you to protect
your own interests...

41:23.380 --> 41:25.758
as I am compelled to protect mine.

41:25.883 --> 41:29.178
If there's one more infraction of the rules...

41:29.261 --> 41:32.056
if you cannot conduct yourselves
without creating a disturbance...

41:32.181 --> 41:34.266
without further accidents...

41:34.391 --> 41:38.771
then I shall have to use every means
to keep you under control.

41:38.854 --> 41:42.358
So that's it, men. Meet me halfway
and you can depend on me...

41:42.483 --> 41:45.361
to see that every prisoner is treated fairly.

42:09.885 --> 42:11.762
Cell R1 7.

42:12.972 --> 42:16.892
Convict McLain of cell R1 7 buried.

42:17.059 --> 42:20.771
Collins comes back from solitary
to cell R1 7.

42:20.980 --> 42:23.566
A prisoner is killed in the presence
of three convicts...

42:24.066 --> 42:25.860
all from cell R1 7.

42:25.985 --> 42:27.862
And now a suicide.

42:27.987 --> 42:29.780
Same cell, same gang, same trouble.

42:29.989 --> 42:33.284
just a minute. You're not tryin' to say
that we had anything to do with that.

42:33.492 --> 42:36.287
- You said yourself, it was suicide.
- Only because I can't prove otherwise.

42:36.287 --> 42:39.999
- Tom was one of us. The way we felt about him...
- I know. I know. You loved him.

42:40.082 --> 42:42.668
You can't throw the hook into us.
We didn't touch Tom.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.379
- You know we were at the movies.
- So you were.

42:45.463 --> 42:48.591
And Collins was at the doctor's office
this morning when Wilson was killed.

42:48.591 --> 42:51.468
I'm a realist.
I don't believe in coincidence.

42:51.594 --> 42:53.596
Especially when it happens
more than once.

42:54.889 --> 42:58.100
You fought the warden,
the guards and me.

42:58.100 --> 43:02.188
You're not ft for civil life,
and you won't accept prison life.

43:02.271 --> 43:04.565
So tomorrow you'll begin a new life.

43:04.565 --> 43:06.901
You'll all report for work in the drainpipe.

43:30.090 --> 43:32.593
- Soldier.
- Yeah?

43:34.178 --> 43:36.764
Hill 633, what is it?
What does it mean to you?

43:36.889 --> 43:39.975
Well, it's a hill in Italy,
not far from Rome. Why?

43:43.771 --> 43:45.898
- Tell me about it.
- There's not much to tell.

43:45.981 --> 43:48.400
The krauts had the hill,
and we were ordered to take it.

43:48.484 --> 43:50.069
How?
What'd you do, charge 'em?

43:50.277 --> 43:54.490
Did you ever try it uphill with a few
kraut 88s puttin' the blast on ya?

43:54.573 --> 43:57.076
Spencer, let me have those chessmen,
will ya?

44:00.788 --> 44:02.581
Give me some light.

44:09.296 --> 44:12.299
Here was the hill.
Here was us.

44:14.385 --> 44:17.304
Mountains here,
the ocean here.

44:17.304 --> 44:19.306
- Stalemate.
- But you took it.

44:19.390 --> 44:23.602
Yeah. We took it, all right.
Give me some more light.

44:25.980 --> 44:28.482
We sent some men out in a boat.

44:28.607 --> 44:30.484
They landed up here.

44:30.693 --> 44:32.987
We covered 'em
with a heavy bombardment.

44:32.987 --> 44:35.281
At "H" hour, we attacked uphill.

44:37.283 --> 44:39.910
The krauts turned all their guns to stop us.

44:39.994 --> 44:43.080
That was exactly when the other gang
attacked from behind.

44:43.205 --> 44:45.082
And it worked.

44:47.001 --> 44:48.877
Yeah.

44:48.877 --> 44:52.089
We got through, all right.
Most of us anyway.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.175
The rest are still there.

45:09.982 --> 45:13.402
They couldn't cover both sides, huh?

45:12.901 --> 45:15.195
Thanks, Soldier.

45:14.903 --> 45:17.698
How's that tie in with us, Joe?
What are you gettin' at?

45:18.490 --> 45:20.284
Tomorrow.

45:20.409 --> 45:22.411
We'll see tomorrow.

45:26.081 --> 45:28.500
You know, I was just thinking.

45:28.500 --> 45:32.588
An insurance company
could go fiat broke in this prison.

45:45.684 --> 45:47.603
Good morning, Louie.

45:47.686 --> 45:49.605
Good morning.

46:02.910 --> 46:05.412
I know how you feel, Gallagher,
and I'm sorry, but that's it.

46:05.496 --> 46:07.206
But it doesn't add up, Warden.

46:07.414 --> 46:09.708
You're punishing all of us
because Lister took his life. Why?

46:09.917 --> 46:12.503
Things are out of hand. That's why.
It's the only decision we could make.

46:12.503 --> 46:14.004
- We? You mean Munsey.
- No.

46:14.088 --> 46:16.382
- I'm the warden here. This is my order.
- It's his work.

46:16.507 --> 46:19.009
I've heard complaints about Munsey for years,
and I'm sick of 'em.

46:19.218 --> 46:21.678
Munsey knows his job, and he does his job.

46:22.679 --> 46:26.308
Gallagher, I've tried my best to do
the right thing by the men, but it's just no use.

46:25.891 --> 46:29.103
I'm convinced now that what's needed here
is not more charity, but more discipline.

46:29.311 --> 46:32.815
Yes? No, no. Absolutely. No interviews!

46:32.815 --> 46:35.192
I don't care what newspaper he's with.

46:35.317 --> 46:37.820
Did you get McCallum yet?
Well, keep on trying.

46:37.820 --> 46:40.280
Well, thanks for seeing me, Warden.

46:40.406 --> 46:43.784
Just a minute.
There's one more thing, Gallagher.

46:44.785 --> 46:46.620
I was going to send for you.

46:49.289 --> 46:52.209
- This letter concerns you.
- Yeah?

46:54.002 --> 46:57.005
Gallagher, you and I have always
been able to work together.

46:57.214 --> 47:01.385
- You've been a great help to me with the men.
- What is it?

47:01.510 --> 47:04.513
The Department of Corrections...

47:04.596 --> 47:08.600
They've canceled
all parole hearings indefinitely.

47:12.521 --> 47:16.191
What's this mean?
Another year?

47:16.316 --> 47:18.318
Two? Five?

47:18.318 --> 47:21.196
Not necessarily.

47:21.405 --> 47:23.824
I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.

47:23.824 --> 47:27.703
It is your fault!
You've given in to Munsey all along the line.

47:27.786 --> 47:31.999
A couple of weeks ago I stood here, and you
told me the gates were going to open for me.

47:32.124 --> 47:35.586
In just a few more days I was going home.

47:35.711 --> 47:39.298
Home.
I should have known better.

47:39.423 --> 47:41.425
Those gates only open three times...

47:41.508 --> 47:43.719
when you come in,
when you've served your time...

47:43.719 --> 47:45.721
or when you're dead!

47:46.597 --> 47:48.015
Gallagher.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.686
Can I still count on your cooperation?

47:59.401 --> 48:02.988
Look at me, fellas. Hi.
I just got a pip of an assignment.

48:02.988 --> 48:05.991
I gotta write a story provin' how good
the chow is around here.

48:06.116 --> 48:10.120
You prove that and Time magazine
will make you man of the year.

48:11.622 --> 48:13.916
Ah, there's somethin' interestin'.

48:13.999 --> 48:15.918
Now what have you got here?

48:16.001 --> 48:18.003
Message. Collins. Drainpipe.

48:18.003 --> 48:20.088
- We're hot.
- Gotta be done.

48:20.088 --> 48:22.591
Uh, smell that.

48:24.510 --> 48:27.221
Now you know
what happened to Rin Tin Tin.

48:29.223 --> 48:31.016
- Western Union.
- Who?

48:31.099 --> 48:33.727
- Collins.
- What's all the gab about?

48:33.810 --> 48:37.231
Every day, I have to take chow
to them guys down in the drainpipe.

48:37.397 --> 48:39.316
I don't like the job.

48:39.399 --> 48:42.194
The air down there is very unsanitary.

48:42.402 --> 48:44.321
Don't breathe in.

48:44.404 --> 48:46.615
Just breathe out.

48:52.204 --> 48:54.498
I've seen many a guy go to work
in the drainpipe.

48:54.498 --> 48:56.500
There's more goes in as comes out.

48:56.625 --> 48:59.503
They keep buildin' it long enough,
they'll run out of guys.

49:01.004 --> 49:02.798
- Hiya, Shorty.
- Hi.

49:03.715 --> 49:05.300
Besides, they're buildin' it backwards.

49:05.425 --> 49:08.512
Nobody knows where that drainpipe
is goin' or where it'll come out...

49:08.595 --> 49:11.014
or if it'll ever be used.

49:11.098 --> 49:14.518
- Hiya, Tyrone.
- Hiya, Muggsy.

49:14.726 --> 49:16.603
You know, the way I got it figured out...

49:16.728 --> 49:19.523
Make sense.
What are you tryin' to say?

49:19.731 --> 49:23.318
Well, uh, I got a favor to pose you.

49:23.318 --> 49:25.320
Don't ask me no favors.

49:25.404 --> 49:27.531
I can't be bribed, see?

49:29.533 --> 49:32.202
Besides, you ain't got enough dough
to bribe me.

49:46.008 --> 49:48.302
I was once married
to a dame like that bridge.

49:48.427 --> 49:51.597
- What are you talking about?
- Wonderful structure...

49:51.597 --> 49:54.099
but up in the air most of the time.

50:51.406 --> 50:53.742
Becker, leave him alone.
Get back to work.

50:53.825 --> 50:56.411
- He's sick. He needs help.
- Back!

50:59.122 --> 51:01.416
I said get back.

51:02.542 --> 51:04.503
I'm all right, Soldier.

51:06.838 --> 51:08.840
Chow.

51:40.122 --> 51:42.708
- No. None for me.
- Better take it.

52:16.116 --> 52:19.536
- Don't mind us, Father. We're just looking around.
- Shopping or buying?

52:19.619 --> 52:22.330
New orders. We're supposed to
watch the men no matter where they are.

52:22.414 --> 52:24.416
In here,
someone else watches after them.

52:24.624 --> 52:27.127
- However, if you wish to stay.
- Thanks.

52:35.844 --> 52:37.637
This'll be it then.

52:38.847 --> 52:40.849
The main tower.

52:40.932 --> 52:42.726
We need it to open the gates.

52:42.851 --> 52:45.520
When the gates open,
the bridge comes down.

52:45.520 --> 52:48.815
We all know there's no way out
except over that bridge.

52:50.942 --> 52:52.652
So first we've got to take the tower.

52:54.029 --> 52:57.949
Now, you'll be here on the inside.

52:59.534 --> 53:02.120
When we come out of the drainpipe,
we'll be here...

53:02.245 --> 53:04.122
on the outside.

53:04.247 --> 53:06.541
We hit the tower from both sides.

53:08.543 --> 53:11.546
Lot of rifles and ammunition
in that tower...

53:11.630 --> 53:13.548
but only one machine gun.

53:13.632 --> 53:18.637
Only one. Which means
they can't cover both sides.

53:20.138 --> 53:22.933
- Once we take the tower...
- Yeah.

53:23.934 --> 53:26.853
- How many men have you got?
- Five, countin' me. All set.

53:26.937 --> 53:28.939
I have six.

53:30.941 --> 53:34.736
My men won't know about you. I'm gonna
tell them only what they have to know.

53:34.820 --> 53:36.947
Mine won't know any more.
When are you figuring?

53:36.822 --> 53:38.740
- 12:15 tomorrow.
- You're crazy!

53:38.824 --> 53:41.535
- That's just why we've got a chance.
- This takes timing, planning.

53:41.743 --> 53:43.954
No. The longer you wait,
the longer the odds.

53:44.955 --> 53:45.956
Somebody cools off,
another guy stalls...

53:46.832 --> 53:48.250
a third guy can't keep his mouth shut.

53:48.333 --> 53:52.254
No. For us it's now. We hit 'em hard,
fast, sudden, and we make it...

53:58.260 --> 54:00.220
Tomorrow.

54:01.721 --> 54:04.140
All right, Collins.
Tomorrow it is.

54:04.349 --> 54:06.935
You will take care of everything?
The stuff to blow the tower?

54:07.352 --> 54:09.145
- That's gonna be tough.
- We gotta have it.

54:09.145 --> 54:11.147
All right. I'll try and get it to you.

54:12.357 --> 54:16.945
Tomorrow then.
You hit the yard at 12:15.

54:17.445 --> 54:19.322
I'll need two minutes.

54:19.322 --> 54:22.659
At exactly 12:17 I'll be in the tower
opening the gates.

54:22.742 --> 54:25.453
12:17.

54:25.620 --> 54:27.539
The yard'll be full then.

54:27.622 --> 54:30.041
When those gates open,
the whole population'll break out.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.752
Amen.

54:34.254 --> 54:37.340
I know you got it all worked out, Joe,
but don't we need a getaway car?

54:37.424 --> 54:40.635
How about money?
Can't get far without a little cash.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.346
And clothes.
In these things we'd be spotted right away.

54:43.430 --> 54:45.348
That's all I can tell you for now.

54:45.432 --> 54:49.227
But we've been talking out
for a long time, and this is it.

54:49.352 --> 54:54.441
Joe, I don't want you to get sore, but, well,
I've only got a short stretch left to do, and...

54:54.524 --> 54:56.443
There's no such thing as a short stretch.

54:56.526 --> 55:00.530
But you haven't told us much. We don't know
how it'll work or what's supposed to happen.

55:00.655 --> 55:02.949
You're moving so fast that I...

55:03.450 --> 55:05.243
Say it.
You want to pull out?

55:05.452 --> 55:07.746
He can't.
We don't know any more than you do.

55:07.829 --> 55:09.956
- You declared yourself in. You can't quit now.
- Shut up.

55:10.248 --> 55:12.042
Don't misunderstand me, Joe.

55:12.250 --> 55:14.753
Ixnay!

55:14.836 --> 55:16.838
- How many?
- Two.

55:17.047 --> 55:19.549
- I'll play these.
- Three here.

55:22.344 --> 55:24.429
Spencer.

55:24.554 --> 55:26.431
In or out?

55:30.435 --> 55:33.939
No guarantees go with this break.

55:34.147 --> 55:39.653
It's all or nothing.
But you've gotta make up your mind now. Now.

55:43.531 --> 55:45.867
Either way, no hard feelings.

55:47.661 --> 55:49.537
With you, Joe.

55:49.663 --> 55:51.539
I'll play along.

55:52.666 --> 55:54.542
I never thought different.

55:56.544 --> 55:59.255
- Neither did I.
- Joe.

56:01.758 --> 56:02.968
Tomorrow.

56:13.436 --> 56:15.438
I wonder what I'm gonna do.

56:15.730 --> 56:18.358
Manage a couple of heavyweights maybe.

56:18.441 --> 56:22.237
Who knows? I might even
wind up owning a piece of a champ.

56:24.447 --> 56:27.158
All you guys'll sit ringside... free.

56:28.368 --> 56:30.036
You're kidding yourself, Coy.

56:30.161 --> 56:33.373
Odds are, once we're on the outside,
we'll never see each other again.

56:33.456 --> 56:35.333
The big city for me.

56:35.458 --> 56:39.462
When you got millions of neighbors,
nobody cares who lives next door.

56:39.462 --> 56:42.048
I'll find a right dame.

56:42.173 --> 56:44.551
And that...

56:44.634 --> 56:48.138
That'll be that.

56:47.554 --> 56:50.640
Say, won't Henrietta be surprised?

56:51.558 --> 56:55.145
I think me and her'll go away
on a long trip.

56:55.353 --> 56:58.773
Sure. Most cons get married
as soon as they get out.

56:58.857 --> 57:01.151
Married? Gee, I never thought of that.

57:05.447 --> 57:09.868
Hope you make it, Coy.
You going back in the stock racket, Spencer?

57:09.951 --> 57:13.538
I think not.
Printing costs are so high these days.

57:14.748 --> 57:17.167
Oh, I don't exactly know what I'll do.

57:17.375 --> 57:19.836
Not yet.
What about you, Soldier?

57:19.961 --> 57:22.172
Me?

57:22.464 --> 57:24.674
I got a long way to go.

57:26.176 --> 57:30.138
Ever since the war, I've been trying to
get back to a little town in Italy.

57:32.140 --> 57:34.350
But you know how the breaks go.

57:34.476 --> 57:37.353
With me, one rap led to another.

57:38.563 --> 57:40.857
Anyway, I was never able to make it.

57:42.859 --> 57:44.861
Maybe this time.

58:02.670 --> 58:04.964
Robert.

58:05.048 --> 58:07.550
Robert.

58:07.550 --> 58:11.054
Robert, you must go away.
The military police... they were here.

58:13.264 --> 58:15.850
When were they here?
How long ago? What did they say?

58:15.975 --> 58:17.977
I talked to them.
It was nothing.

58:18.061 --> 58:21.272
- There are more important things.
- He has brought no food. He is leaving.

58:21.481 --> 58:23.483
- So?
- Food's out there in the truck.

58:23.566 --> 58:25.652
- Thank you.
- No. We will take nothing.

58:25.860 --> 58:28.947
You will stand in line with the others.
When there is food, you will eat.

58:29.072 --> 58:31.783
- And when there is no food?
- Then you will starve with the others.

58:31.866 --> 58:35.078
Mm-hmm. We're not all
so fortunate as you, my daughter.

58:35.161 --> 58:37.956
We have no great love
to quiet our appetites.

58:38.081 --> 58:40.375
Robert does not object.
Why do you?

58:40.375 --> 58:42.669
He does not know you so well as I.

58:42.752 --> 58:48.675
Ah. Is it so great a crime to accept food
from those who deprived you of it?

58:48.758 --> 58:50.969
Nothing personal, of course, but...

58:51.052 --> 58:55.056
since you do not spare the bombs,
we do not expect you to spare the food.

58:55.181 --> 58:57.684
- You Americans are such a generous...
- Never mind the speeches.

58:57.851 --> 58:59.978
- The food's out there. Go get it.
- No!

59:00.061 --> 59:04.566
He hates you, Robert. He hates your uniform.
He fought you in Sicily. He still fights you.

59:04.774 --> 59:07.652
My position does not permit me
to hate anyone.

59:17.662 --> 59:19.664
Hey.

59:20.874 --> 59:22.959
I'm foolish, so I cry.

59:23.084 --> 59:25.879
It's nothing.
In a war, people cry easy.

59:27.755 --> 59:30.550
- Promise me you won't come here again.
- Oh.

59:30.675 --> 59:32.677
- If the police should find you...
- Shh.

59:33.887 --> 59:36.389
Bringing us food this way
is against the law.

59:37.849 --> 59:39.976
The law is second.

59:40.059 --> 59:42.061
My wife comes first.

59:58.786 --> 01:00:00.663
Your military... they are back!

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:04.959
This food... say nothing about it.
You understand?

01:00:05.084 --> 01:00:07.086
Robert is a stranger.
We never saw him before.

01:00:08.087 --> 01:00:09.172
He stopped here for water.
Water for the truck.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.674
And if they discovered I was lying,
what then?

01:00:11.382 --> 01:00:14.761
- Why should I risk my neck for you?
- Because I stuck mine out for you.

01:00:14.761 --> 01:00:16.888
For me? No, signor.
You came to see her.

01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:21.184
I will not lie for you.
You and your police can destroy each other.

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.979
Sit down!

01:00:24.979 --> 01:00:27.565
Sit down!

01:00:27.774 --> 01:00:29.984
Gina, keep him here.

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:32.987
I'll get the water.
If they believe me, I've got a chance.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:50.088
- You had nothing to do with this. Remember that.
- No. Robert...

01:00:50.171 --> 01:00:54.259
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.763
Hey, Soldier. Hey, Soldier. Snap out of it.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:00.890
You're missin' a swell yarn.

01:01:02.976 --> 01:01:06.896
- Go ahead, Spencer.
- Well, gentlemen, as I was saying...

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.857
there I was,
besieged on all sides...

01:01:09.983 --> 01:01:13.194
the citizens to the front,
the howling investors behind me...

01:01:14.279 --> 01:01:15.863
the sheriff's men closing in.

01:01:15.989 --> 01:01:18.491
But I remained undaunted.

01:01:18.658 --> 01:01:21.577
Smiling, secure in my rights.

01:01:21.786 --> 01:01:24.789
- What happened?
- Here I am.

01:01:24.872 --> 01:01:27.458
- Okay. Break it up. Let's try to get some sleep.
- Why?

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:31.170
- I like to hear Spencer talk.
- We've talked too much already.

01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:34.882
There are ears all over this drum,
and they all belong to one guy.

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:42.181
What's the answer to it? Are we going to
have to keep every prisoner in ritual solitary?

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:44.892
Other prisons must have
these same problems...

01:01:44.475 --> 01:01:46.686
but they clear them up,
keep things running smoothly.

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.896
We've been through
difficult times before, Warden.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.982
Oh, never like this.

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.776
And McCallum is coming tomorrow. Why?

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:56.487
Why can't he let me alone?

01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:58.573
Everything's gone wrong.

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:02.869
I don't know who's to blame, but...

01:02:03.661 --> 01:02:06.789
I do know that every prisoner hates us.

01:02:06.873 --> 01:02:09.000
Not us. Me.

01:02:09.083 --> 01:02:12.170
- It's me they hate.
- I wonder why.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.678
You put on a guard's uniform
and see how much they love you.

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:27.185
You talk to the prisoners over a loudspeaker.
I talk to them with a club.

01:02:26.601 --> 01:02:30.772
- You only make the rules. I have to enforce them.
- Maybe it's the way you enforce them.

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:33.983
Maybe it is.

01:02:34.067 --> 01:02:37.570
Oh, I'm not criticizing, Munsey.
It's just that...

01:02:37.779 --> 01:02:41.783
But you are.
And perhaps you're right.

01:02:41.866 --> 01:02:45.787
All I know is that I've tried
to do my job as I saw it.

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:50.583
But if I'm the cause of this trouble...
if I'm wrong and those convicts are right...

01:02:50.792 --> 01:02:52.877
then you can have
my resignation immediately.

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:57.298
No, Munsey. That's just what the inmates
would like. No, no. That's not the answer.

01:02:57.799 --> 01:03:00.802
As you said, we've been through
some difficult times together here. Well...

01:03:00.885 --> 01:03:03.805
we're still here,
and we're still together.

01:03:03.888 --> 01:03:06.682
Let's, uh, leave it that way, hmm?

01:03:08.768 --> 01:03:11.687
Well, the situation
seems to call for a drink.

01:03:12.605 --> 01:03:15.274
- Warden?
- Thanks. L, uh...

01:03:16.484 --> 01:03:18.694
I'm going to turn in.
Good night.

01:03:18.778 --> 01:03:24.200
Don't be discouraged, Warden.
It's a rule in all the best stories.

01:03:24.909 --> 01:03:27.703
Everybody always lives happily ever after.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:31.207
Good night.

01:03:34.669 --> 01:03:38.089
You don't believe I meant
what I said about resigning, do you, Doctor?

01:03:38.172 --> 01:03:40.299
In a million words...

01:03:41.008 --> 01:03:43.302
no.

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:44.679
You're wrong.

01:03:44.804 --> 01:03:46.889
I really want to help the warden.

01:03:46.973 --> 01:03:49.809
It's just that he's confused.

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:54.272
He doesn't know that kindness
is actually weakness.

01:03:55.606 --> 01:03:59.110
And weakness is an infection that
makes a man a follower instead of a leader.

01:03:59.193 --> 01:04:04.073
Seems too me a very great leader
once said the meek shall inherit the earth.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.078
Science contradicts that, Doctor.

01:04:09.203 --> 01:04:11.789
Nature proves that the weak must die...

01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:14.083
so that the strong may live.

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:16.085
Authority...

01:04:16.294 --> 01:04:18.087
cleverness...

01:04:18.379 --> 01:04:20.298
imagination.

01:04:20.381 --> 01:04:23.092
Those are the real differences between men.

01:04:24.302 --> 01:04:29.307
I walk amongst these convicts...
these thieves and murderers...

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.101
alone, unarmed.

01:04:33.394 --> 01:04:35.396
But they respect me.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:40.109
They obey me.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.779
- Fits you, doesn't it?
- Hmm?

01:04:43.905 --> 01:04:47.783
The warden's chair.

01:04:47.909 --> 01:04:50.411
- It fits you.
- You're drunk.

01:04:50.411 --> 01:04:53.706
Why not? I'm a very ordinary man.

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:56.209
I get drunk on whiskey.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.586
What makes you drunk?

01:04:58.711 --> 01:05:01.714
- Power?
- You flatter me, Doctor.

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:05.092
I'm just a policeman.
I carry out the warden's orders.

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:09.388
Did he ever order you
to crucify the prisoners?

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:14.185
Were you ordered
to make convict Lister hang himself?

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:18.397
- What are you talking about?
- You were seen going into Lister's cell...

01:05:18.689 --> 01:05:20.316
and you were seen coming out.

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:24.278
What happened in between?
Did you censor his mail?

01:05:24.403 --> 01:05:26.697
Wouldn't he give you
any information?

01:05:26.781 --> 01:05:30.284
Or did you tell him a few lies
about his wife?

01:05:33.287 --> 01:05:35.706
You better stop drinking, Doctor.

01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:38.292
Your imagination's working overtime.

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:42.922
Visiting cells is part of my job,
helps me keep tabs on the men.

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:46.008
- In that way, I can control them.
- Control them?

01:05:46.092 --> 01:05:48.886
You mean torture them, don't you?

01:05:48.886 --> 01:05:52.390
The more pain you inflict,
the more pleasure you get.

01:05:52.598 --> 01:05:55.810
That's why you'd never resign
from this prison.

01:05:55.893 --> 01:06:00.815
Where else would you find
so many helpless flies to stick pins into?

01:06:01.816 --> 01:06:04.986
You talk to me like that?

01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:07.113
If I didn't keep you here,
you'd be starving.

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:09.699
You surgical butcher.

01:06:09.782 --> 01:06:12.785
For me, it's the last stop anyway.

01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:17.290
But for you it's just a beginning, isn't it?

01:06:17.415 --> 01:06:20.501
Why, you're Genghis Khan...

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:23.004
Alexander the Great...

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:24.797
Caesar.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:27.508
Look at you in the warden's chair.

01:06:28.009 --> 01:06:30.094
Caesar trying out his throne.

01:06:31.095 --> 01:06:36.309
- That's enough.
- Caesar cries "Enough"?

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:37.810
Come, come.

01:06:39.186 --> 01:06:41.814
You're obvious, Munsey.

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:45.818
Your every move is obvious.

01:06:46.193 --> 01:06:47.903
You've cheated.

01:06:48.112 --> 01:06:51.699
You've lied.
You've murdered.

01:06:51.824 --> 01:06:54.785
You're worse than the worst inmates
of this prison.

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.289
You're the psychopath here,
not they!

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:13.012
That's it, Munsey.

01:07:14.305 --> 01:07:17.099
That's it.

01:07:17.224 --> 01:07:19.518
Not cleverness.

01:07:19.727 --> 01:07:21.896
Not imagination.

01:07:22.021 --> 01:07:24.315
just force.

01:07:24.398 --> 01:07:27.193
Brute force.

01:07:27.193 --> 01:07:29.403
Congratulations.

01:07:29.528 --> 01:07:32.490
Force does make leaders.

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:34.492
But you forget one thing.

01:07:35.493 --> 01:07:38.412
It also destroys them.

01:08:09.694 --> 01:08:12.613
Couple of hundred yards ahead
there's a side road. Turn right.

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:15.408
We got over a hundred miles to go.
We shouldn't be stoppin' now.

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:17.702
- Shut up.
- Take it easy, Joe. Take it easy.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.830
Why don't you see her after the job?

01:08:20.912 --> 01:08:23.499
Because I said we're stopping now.

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:25.835
Okay, okay.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.438
I'll only be a few minutes.

01:08:48.107 --> 01:08:50.901
- Sadie.
- Good evening, Mr. Collins.

01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:57.408
- Is she all right?
- She don't complain none, but she's about the same.

01:09:00.118 --> 01:09:02.830
See that she doesn't need anything.

01:09:02.912 --> 01:09:07.835
Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Collins, I'm glad you're here.

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:09.837
Excuse me.

01:09:39.325 --> 01:09:40.701
Ruth.

01:09:43.037 --> 01:09:46.040
Joe. Joe, darling.

01:09:46.122 --> 01:09:48.125
- I was dreaming about you.
- Something nice?

01:09:48.209 --> 01:09:50.836
I dreamed I was running up a hill.
I was chasing you.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.505
- Catch me?
- Almost.

01:09:52.505 --> 01:09:54.507
I must be slowin' down.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.219
I guess I can make it come out
any way I want. It's my dream.

01:10:02.723 --> 01:10:05.434
Pretty soon now you're gonna be
getting out of that chair.

01:10:05.518 --> 01:10:07.728
And it won't be a dream either.

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:11.232
Joe, darling.

01:10:11.315 --> 01:10:13.734
The first thing we'll do
is go for a long walk.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.820
- No cars for us. No trains.
- Just walking.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:19.532
- We'll walk around the world.
- I'm tired already.

01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:22.618
I'll have Sadie fix you some supper.

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:24.620
And then we'll talk.

01:10:24.829 --> 01:10:29.208
Oh, I've got a million things to tell you,
and this time I won't forget them. I made a list.

01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:31.210
Ruth, I can't stay.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:35.339
Next time, when I come back, I'll...

01:10:35.339 --> 01:10:37.007
- Another next time?
- This is the last of them.

01:10:37.133 --> 01:10:39.218
When I come back, it'll be for good.

01:10:43.013 --> 01:10:44.849
I love you, Ruth.

01:10:44.932 --> 01:10:50.521
Why? I'm sick, Joe.
Why do you love me?

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:53.440
When you're sick, people don't really love you.
They only feel sorry for you.

01:10:53.524 --> 01:10:57.319
I'm not people.
I'm Joe Collins. One guy.

01:11:02.241 --> 01:11:04.118
Joe.

01:11:04.243 --> 01:11:07.538
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm selfish.

01:11:07.621 --> 01:11:11.625
Every time you walk out that door
I'm afraid you're never coming back.

01:11:12.543 --> 01:11:15.421
If I only knew where you came from,
where you go, what you do.

01:11:15.546 --> 01:11:19.341
Ruth, let's leave things
the way they started.

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:23.220
I'm a guy who ran out of gas who saw
an ordinary little farmhouse by the side of the road...

01:11:23.429 --> 01:11:27.141
who found the first important thing
in his life waiting for him in a wheelchair.

01:11:27.224 --> 01:11:30.144
Let's keep it that way
for just a little while longer.

01:11:30.227 --> 01:11:32.313
Another day, maybe two, and...

01:11:32.438 --> 01:11:35.316
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

01:11:35.441 --> 01:11:37.443
I know what I want to know.

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:40.321
The rest doesn't matter.

01:11:40.446 --> 01:11:43.449
If I weren't so sick, I could help you.

01:11:45.826 --> 01:11:48.245
There are all kinds of sick people, Ruth.

01:11:48.412 --> 01:11:50.247
Maybe we can help each other.

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:57.546
- I love you, Joe.
- Go on back and finish that dream.

01:11:57.630 --> 01:12:00.424
I'll slow down,
and you won't have to run so fast.

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:04.053
And when you catch me,
hold on tight.

01:12:36.126 --> 01:12:37.127
- Spencer.
- Here.

01:12:37.127 --> 01:12:38.128
- Becker.
- Here.

01:12:38.253 --> 01:12:39.254
- Stack.
- Here.

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:40.339
- Collins.
- Yeah.

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:41.340
- Coy.
- Yeah.

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:43.634
Let's go.

01:13:00.234 --> 01:13:02.820
Only a couple of more hours.
Work close together.

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:09.827
Load's ready.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:15.249
Take it easy, Roberts.
You got the whole day ahead of you.

01:13:15.332 --> 01:13:18.335
- Sure. This is my racket.
- Thanks.

01:13:22.256 --> 01:13:24.550
Soldier. To the right.

01:13:24.925 --> 01:13:28.262
That switch.
When we break, you'll handle that switch.

01:13:27.845 --> 01:13:30.639
Puts us on the other track...
the one that leads to the tower.

01:13:31.432 --> 01:13:33.225
- Got that?
- Check.

01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.227
- What's all the chatter?
- Just wondering what time it was.

01:13:35.436 --> 01:13:38.022
Why? You workin' by the hour?

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:55.247
- Morning, fellas.
- Hi, Louie.

01:13:58.959 --> 01:14:00.961
- Morning, Chappie.
- Another story?

01:14:01.128 --> 01:14:03.839
- Yeah, but this is a good one. Hiya, fellas.
- Hello, Louie.

01:14:03.964 --> 01:14:07.551
Finally gonna make you grease monkeys famous.
Gonna put you all on the front page.

01:14:07.634 --> 01:14:09.845
That's what got us here.

01:14:09.928 --> 01:14:11.930
Hey!

01:14:12.139 --> 01:14:17.144
Tell me, Charlie. What has prison life
taught you about being a mechanic?

01:14:17.227 --> 01:14:20.564
It's taught me that when I get out
I shouldn't be a mechanic.

01:14:25.235 --> 01:14:28.363
What about it, Andy?
Got anything to say to the press?

01:14:28.447 --> 01:14:31.366
There ain't much to say.
I do as I'm told.

01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:34.328
Everything?

01:14:33.952 --> 01:14:35.954
Everything.

01:14:37.664 --> 01:14:38.957
Where do you keep your tools?

01:14:55.432 --> 01:14:58.143
Eight firebombs filled with juice.
The best.

01:14:58.268 --> 01:15:01.271
Eight fuses.
Light two as you drive into the yard.

01:15:01.355 --> 01:15:04.066
Like I say, I always do as I'm told.

01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:06.735
We go to press at 12:15, sharp.

01:15:07.444 --> 01:15:08.654
I'll be there.

01:15:12.157 --> 01:15:14.952
Spell his name right, Louie.
His wife keeps a scrapbook.

01:15:25.337 --> 01:15:28.465
- Is this all right, Gallagher?
- Yeah, fine.

01:15:38.559 --> 01:15:40.269
- News. Some good, some bad.
- Good?

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:44.565
Eight firebombs in the toolbox,
truck ready to go.

01:15:44.648 --> 01:15:45.941
- Bad?
- No dynamite.

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:48.443
- Gotta have it.
- Not a chance. Just came from the dye plant...

01:15:48.569 --> 01:15:50.445
- Gotta have it!
- Not enough time.

01:15:54.575 --> 01:15:58.162
Look, Louie.
I've got an important assignment for ya.

01:15:59.037 --> 01:16:01.540
- Get down to the drainpipe. See Collins.
- Collins?

01:16:01.665 --> 01:16:04.543
He's with us.
Tell him there's no dynamite.

01:16:04.668 --> 01:16:07.546
- Do we go anyway?
- We'll have to go without it.

01:16:07.671 --> 01:16:11.049
And, Louie, you got 45 minutes.

01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:15.053
Think I'd be late for my own coming-out party?

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:18.849
I've already...

01:16:18.849 --> 01:16:19.349
I've already...

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:21.477
But I've tried to explain, madam.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.355
No. No, I'm sorry. All visiting days
have been canceled, even for families.

01:16:25.355 --> 01:16:28.066
- Take off your hat.
- I'm here to get a pass, Miss Lawrence.

01:16:28.066 --> 01:16:30.152
- Where to this time?
- To the drainpipe.

01:16:30.277 --> 01:16:32.070
We're doin' a special layout, and...

01:16:35.866 --> 01:16:38.243
- Wait a minute. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:16:38.243 --> 01:16:40.662
You want to do a story.
We want to help you.

01:16:48.378 --> 01:16:51.548
Captain Munsey's office.
Whose car?

01:16:51.548 --> 01:16:54.843
Mr. McCallum's?
Okay. Pass it through.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:58.472
- What's the matter with him?
- Munsey left orders.

01:16:58.055 --> 01:17:01.141
Oh. You wanted to
go to the drainpipe, huh?

01:17:01.266 --> 01:17:03.644
- Yeah. Anything wrong with that?
- Munsey in?

01:17:03.769 --> 01:17:06.480
- In and waiting.
- Come on.

01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:12.152
- Come in.
- Wait here.

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:17.741
A customer for the drainpipe.

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:20.369
7033. Convict Miller.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.582
Gallagher's man?

01:17:25.082 --> 01:17:27.459
He was looking for a pass
in the warden's office.

01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:30.462
Gallagher?

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:35.259
- You want to see him now?
- Yeah. Yeah. Bring him in.

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:52.484
Hello, Louie.

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:55.779
I understand you're interested
in the drainpipe.

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:57.948
Yes, sir.

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.284
I don't get this, Captain.

01:18:00.367 --> 01:18:04.746
We're planning a big spread on the different
kinds of work the cons are doing, and I...

01:18:04.955 --> 01:18:09.459
Oh, that's right.
You are a reporter, aren't you, Louie?

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.253
Yes, sir.

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:13.255
Sit down.

01:18:14.673 --> 01:18:17.259
No, not there. Here.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.262
What's the point, Captain?

01:18:20.387 --> 01:18:23.265
I've been to the drainpipe before.
I've been there a hundred times.

01:18:23.473 --> 01:18:27.060
- What's the idea of all this?
- Tell me, Louie.

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:29.855
How does an illiterate like you
become a reporter?

01:18:30.856 --> 01:18:33.358
Even a star reporter?

01:18:33.358 --> 01:18:36.153
- I don't know, sir.
- I do.

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:41.366
What business did you have
in the drainpipe?

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.660
- I told ya.
- Tell me again.

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:45.871
To write a story.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.168
I don't like that answer.

01:19:08.352 --> 01:19:10.354
All right, Jackson.

01:19:23.075 --> 01:19:26.870
Gallagher sent you to the drainpipe
to see somebody.

01:19:27.079 --> 01:19:29.581
- Who was it?
- Nobody. Just to write...

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:36.088
- Wrong answer.
- Leave me alone, Captain. Please.

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.882
I don't have the answers you want.

01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:43.678
No?

01:20:09.788 --> 01:20:13.667
Now, we'll begin again.
Who was it Gallagher sent you to see?

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:16.294
I told ya. Nobody.

01:20:16.461 --> 01:20:18.463
He gave you a message.
What was it?

01:20:18.588 --> 01:20:22.467
There was no message.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

01:20:22.592 --> 01:20:25.595
- You don't know much about anything, do ya?
- No.

01:20:25.679 --> 01:20:27.681
I suppose you don't even know...

01:20:27.764 --> 01:20:31.893
that Collins plans to break out
of the drainpipe at 12:15 today, do ya?

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.895
No.

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.981
Do ya?

01:20:57.461 --> 01:20:59.588
You have been lying to me, haven't you?

01:20:59.671 --> 01:21:02.591
Gallagher does know something
about the break, doesn't he?

01:21:04.301 --> 01:21:06.470
I don't know.

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:09.681
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:13.185
You can hit me.

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:15.187
You can keep on hitting me.

01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:19.399
But I don't know what you want.

01:21:37.584 --> 01:21:39.503
Jackson.

01:21:45.884 --> 01:21:47.969
Take him to the isolation ward.

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:52.474
Spread the word that he had an accident
coming back from the drainpipe.

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:54.893
Yes, sir.

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:57.270
Is there any connection
between Gallagher and Collins?

01:21:59.898 --> 01:22:02.192
No.

01:22:02.275 --> 01:22:04.986
If there was, he would have told me.

01:22:07.572 --> 01:22:09.908
Okay. Get your man out of here.

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:12.702
- Hey, you. Muggsy.
- Yeah?

01:22:14.871 --> 01:22:16.790
Comin' up!

01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:19.668
- Bring anything for me?
- No.

01:22:19.876 --> 01:22:21.878
- You sure?
- Sure, Joe.

01:22:24.297 --> 01:22:27.384
- Anything wrong?
- No.

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.803
Back to work.

01:22:29.886 --> 01:22:31.888
Collins.

01:22:40.605 --> 01:22:42.482
All right, Doc.

01:22:42.607 --> 01:22:44.901
The cardiogram just came back
from the lab, Collins.

01:22:44.985 --> 01:22:46.903
- Yeah?
- Have to check you again.

01:22:46.987 --> 01:22:51.283
Make it snappy, Doc.
Okay, okay. Keep it moving.

01:22:59.291 --> 01:23:01.209
Louie was beaten up.

01:23:01.293 --> 01:23:03.503
Munsey.

01:23:03.587 --> 01:23:05.589
Louie might die.

01:23:05.672 --> 01:23:07.507
He sent a message.

01:23:07.591 --> 01:23:11.011
Whatever your plan is,
don't go through with it.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.179
Munsey knows.

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:16.474
Believe me, Joe.
He knows you're going at 12:15.

01:23:17.809 --> 01:23:21.187
He's ready for you, Joe.
He wants you to go.

01:23:21.313 --> 01:23:24.774
A prison break finishes Warden Barnes.

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.776
Munsey'll be the hero.

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:29.487
He's using your life to make himself warden.

01:23:32.699 --> 01:23:34.492
Gallagher been picked up?

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:36.578
Gallagher? No.

01:23:36.703 --> 01:23:39.414
Why?

01:23:39.497 --> 01:23:42.876
Joe, you haven't got a chance.

01:23:44.878 --> 01:23:46.713
How did Munsey find out?

01:23:46.212 --> 01:23:49.716
The Munsey way. An informer.

01:23:49.799 --> 01:23:51.885
One of your own men, I suppose.

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:56.806
Don't go through with it, Joe. Don't.

01:23:58.391 --> 01:24:00.393
Thanks for tryin', Doc.

01:24:48.692 --> 01:24:52.987
We got about 10 minutes.
There's five of us. We'll have to go one at a time.

01:24:53.113 --> 01:24:55.907
- What position do you want?
- You're the boss.

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:57.909
Whatever you say.

01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:07.794
Take your pick for the break.
What position?

01:25:07.919 --> 01:25:11.297
I said I'd play along with you, Joe.
You name it.

01:25:13.425 --> 01:25:15.719
- You.
- Same goes for me.

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:21.516
We've only got a few minutes, Freshman.

01:25:21.599 --> 01:25:24.018
When we break,
what position do you want?

01:25:24.102 --> 01:25:26.396
I want to give all the help I can, Joe.

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:29.107
- What position?
- Last.

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:32.610
That'd be the toughest,
wouldn't it, Joe? Last.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.808
Louie got hurt.

01:26:04.017 --> 01:26:07.687
Got banged up, they say,
comin' back from the drainpipe.

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:09.522
- Coming back?
- Yeah.

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:12.192
- Munsey.
- Keep circulating.

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:18.198
- Hoffman.
- Captain.

01:26:50.396 --> 01:26:53.107
Clay pigeons would have
a better chance.

01:26:53.233 --> 01:26:56.528
Oh. Sorry, Captain.
I didn't see you there.

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:59.030
That's all right, Hopkins.

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:03.993
But just remember. There's no reward
for bringing them back alive.

01:27:03.993 --> 01:27:06.621
- Not in this jungle.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:15.421 --> 01:27:18.007
- Now, is there anything else you want done, sir?
- No.

01:27:26.516 --> 01:27:29.102
Bradley, join the guard
along that section of the wall.

01:27:29.102 --> 01:27:31.229
Yes, sir.

01:27:50.707 --> 01:27:53.209
Load's ready.

01:27:53.418 --> 01:27:55.920
Ready to go?

01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:58.131
Ready to go.

01:28:09.434 --> 01:28:11.728
Look out!

01:28:16.399 --> 01:28:19.110
Drop the club. Drop it.

01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.822
Come here.

01:28:25.909 --> 01:28:28.828
Coy, you and Spencer dump this dirt.
Dump it back there.

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.501
Give me a break, Collins.
I didn't do anything.

01:28:35.627 --> 01:28:38.504
- I didn't have a gun. Give me a break.
- Shut up.

01:28:38.421 --> 01:28:40.715
- Now you men listen to me.
- Collins, count me out.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:44.510
- I don't want any part of this.
- Take me with you, Joe. I'll do anything you say.

01:28:44.636 --> 01:28:47.805
- Just take me with ya.
- Me and my boys are gettin' out of here.

01:28:47.805 --> 01:28:49.807
The action starts in the yard.
That's when we go.

01:28:50.016 --> 01:28:54.103
After that, you can suit yourselves. Right now
do as I say. Get back in the hole... all of you.

01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:57.607
Spencer, you and Coy
strip some of that electric wire.

01:28:58.608 --> 01:29:00.610
Soldier, get that hack over there.

01:29:02.528 --> 01:29:05.615
Joe, what about me?

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:07.408
You?

01:29:09.827 --> 01:29:13.414
It'll be no discredit to you.
You'll go away for a short while.

01:29:13.539 --> 01:29:16.918
When you get back,
we'll try to ft you in someplace else.

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.920
I can't resign.

01:29:24.509 --> 01:29:27.637
- This is my whole life.
- Sign it.

01:29:41.734 --> 01:29:44.612
Get on that loudspeaker.
Tell them you've resigned.

01:29:50.535 --> 01:29:52.412
Attention.

01:29:52.537 --> 01:29:54.539
Attention.

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:57.917
Attention, everybody.

01:29:57.417 --> 01:29:59.419
This is Warden Barnes.

01:29:59.544 --> 01:30:03.923
I have just resigned.

01:30:03.548 --> 01:30:06.843
L, uh...

01:30:06.926 --> 01:30:09.929
Tell them the prison's now
in charge of Captain Munsey.

01:30:11.347 --> 01:30:13.516
- Munsey?
- Go on. Tell them.

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:15.643
No.

01:30:16.936 --> 01:30:19.522
With Warden Barnes's resignation
now in effect...

01:30:19.647 --> 01:30:23.234
this institution
is in charge of Captain Munsey.

01:30:22.525 --> 01:30:26.320
I repeat. Captain Munsey is your warden.

01:30:26.946 --> 01:30:29.323
You will obey him.
You will take all orders from Warden Munsey.

01:30:30.116 --> 01:30:32.326
- Yah!
- Yah!

01:30:33.327 --> 01:30:34.328
Yah! Yah!

01:30:35.121 --> 01:30:37.248
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:41.044
Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:30:41.252 --> 01:30:44.338
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:30:45.214 --> 01:30:48.217
Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:30:48.342 --> 01:30:51.637
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:30:51.721 --> 01:30:54.849
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:30:54.932 --> 01:30:59.020
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:01.939
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:31:02.023 --> 01:31:05.526
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:31:05.651 --> 01:31:09.030
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:31:09.238 --> 01:31:13.242
Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:31:14.118 --> 01:31:16.954
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:19.540
Yah! Yah!

01:31:19.624 --> 01:31:22.919
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:25.546
Yah! Yah!

01:31:51.322 --> 01:31:52.657
- Move!
- Joey, wait!

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:55.326
- Quick!
- You got me wrong! Munsey made me do it, Joe!

01:31:56.327 --> 01:31:57.328
Please! I'll tell you everything! Joe!

01:31:58.121 --> 01:32:00.248
Don't! Not this way! Joe!

01:32:00.456 --> 01:32:02.834
Joe, will you listen to me?

01:32:03.042 --> 01:32:06.337
You'll never make it!
It's a setup! They're waiting for us!

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:08.631
Joe!

01:32:11.342 --> 01:32:12.343
Don't shoot! Don't!

01:32:50.631 --> 01:32:52.842
Jackson.

01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:55.845
You and Tom get down there.
Here. I'll take this.

01:32:55.845 --> 01:32:57.930
Get the gun and come on.

01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:10.336
Come on, Collins. Come on.

01:34:15.967 --> 01:34:17.969
What's the plan now?

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:20.137
The plan's a flop. You're on your own.

01:34:22.265 --> 01:34:24.267
It's a million-to-one.

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:41.033
He's trying to ram the gates!

01:35:11.355 --> 01:35:12.940
It's Collins!

01:36:49.078 --> 01:36:51.872
Gee, that hurt, Doc.

01:36:51.956 --> 01:36:53.958
That hurt plenty.

01:36:54.083 --> 01:36:56.877
This place is full of pain, Calypso.

01:36:58.462 --> 01:37:01.549
You're hurt.

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:05.052
And Collins...

01:37:06.053 --> 01:37:08.764
Collins and Munsey are dead.

01:37:10.057 --> 01:37:12.476
And the others.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.062
All those others.

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:20.067
Why do they do it?
They never get away with it.

01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:25.573
Alcatraz. Atlanta. Leavenworth.

01:37:25.781 --> 01:37:29.869
It's been tried in a hundred ways
from as many places.

01:37:29.952 --> 01:37:32.371
Always failed.

01:37:32.455 --> 01:37:34.957
But they keep trying.

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:37.251
Why do they do it?

01:37:37.376 --> 01:37:39.253
I don't know, Doc.

01:37:39.378 --> 01:37:42.965
But whenever you got men in prison,
they're gonna want to get out.

01:37:42.965 --> 01:37:44.967
But they learn.

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.262
They must!

01:37:50.389 --> 01:37:52.475
Nobody escapes.

01:37:55.478 --> 01:37:58.189
Nobody ever really escapes.
