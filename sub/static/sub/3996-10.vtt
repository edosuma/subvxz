WEBVTT

00:00.718 --> 00:02.605
$50 in the douche bag jar?

00:02.699 --> 00:04.664
- Absolutely, man.
- Yes, absolutely.

00:04.667 --> 00:06.656
- Why so much?
- I feel like it should actually be

00:06.657 --> 00:08.706
more in the 100, 200 range,
so that's a discount.

00:08.707 --> 00:11.668
Think about what
you did, Schmidt.

00:12.748 --> 00:14.747
I lost it.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.697
I lost the party bus.

00:16.698 --> 00:18.668
The party bus for
your birthday party?

00:18.669 --> 00:19.722
Yeah.

00:19.723 --> 00:20.743
Apparently,

00:20.744 --> 00:22.705
my business isn't as important

00:22.706 --> 00:25.676
as Frankie Muniz's.

00:25.677 --> 00:26.696
They canceled my rez.

00:26.697 --> 00:27.746
There's nothing I can do;
The party's off.

00:27.747 --> 00:28.748
You should torch them

00:28.749 --> 00:29.748
on Yelp.

00:29.749 --> 00:31.688
Actually, I can do it.

00:31.689 --> 00:33.662
I have an account under the name
Fantastic Jacques.

00:33.663 --> 00:34.744
He's a French diplomat

00:34.745 --> 00:36.672
with very little patience.

00:36.673 --> 00:38.722
Or you could just get
another bus.

00:38.723 --> 00:39.747
In two days?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.701
Okay, yeah, sure, Winston.

00:41.702 --> 00:43.718
W-Why don't I just go down
to the party bus store,

00:43.719 --> 00:47.667
where all the party buses have
a state-of-the-art sound system,

00:47.668 --> 00:49.701
a stripper pole, a love grotto,

00:49.702 --> 00:51.710
and a steering wheel
in the shape of a boob.

00:52.685 --> 00:53.748
You honk the nipple.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.676
It's pretty awesome.

00:55.677 --> 00:56.700
Just have the party at a bar.

00:56.701 --> 00:57.723
Nick, this is it.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.667
This is my 29th birthday party.

01:00.668 --> 01:01.694
This is the year.
After this,

01:01.695 --> 01:05.689
I don't know, it's just...
just all darkness.

01:11.689 --> 01:13.655

01:39.051 --> 01:41.063
Hey, I just came
to make sure you're okay.

01:42.122 --> 01:44.091
I'm not okay, Jess.

01:44.092 --> 01:46.051
I had to cancel
my birthday party.

01:46.052 --> 01:48.029
It's social suicide.

01:48.030 --> 01:49.124
I can feel my it
factor going away.

01:49.125 --> 01:51.120
And then what am I
gonna tell Benjamin?

01:51.121 --> 01:53.028
Why are you so worried
about Benjamin?

01:53.029 --> 01:54.068
He's your friend.

01:54.069 --> 01:57.062
We have a very weird,
girl-style friendship

01:57.063 --> 01:59.046
where we kind of
hate each other.

01:59.047 --> 02:01.029
We're bronemies.

02:01.030 --> 02:02.088
He's my fremesis.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.029
I'm so confused right now.

02:04.030 --> 02:06.036
Okay, look, Benjamin and I...
we were suitemates in college.

02:06.037 --> 02:07.109
Benjamin, I can't wait
to get to L.A.

02:07.110 --> 02:09.050
We're going to have
so much sex...

02:09.050 --> 02:10.086
in the morning,

02:10.086 --> 02:11.072
in the afternoon,

02:11.073 --> 02:12.072
at bedtime.

02:12.073 --> 02:14.037
Mmm, peanuts.

02:14.038 --> 02:15.107
I'm telling you, man,
I'm gonna run that town

02:15.108 --> 02:16.118
one day...
You'll see.

02:16.119 --> 02:18.037
I'm gonna write you a check

02:18.038 --> 02:19.086
right now for $100 million.

02:19.087 --> 02:20.088
How do you like that?

02:20.089 --> 02:21.117
Damn, dude.

02:21.118 --> 02:23.087
And this is a real check.

02:23.088 --> 02:25.076
You can cash it
when I'm rich and awesome.

02:25.077 --> 02:26.533
Give me about four years.

02:26.573 --> 02:28.652
- Do the song.
- ♪ We built this Schmidty ♪

02:29.116 --> 02:33.118
♪ We built this Schmidty
on Tootsie Rolls. ♪

02:35.088 --> 02:37.122
If it wasn't for Benjamin,
I, I never would have become

02:37.123 --> 02:40.037
a Los Angeles baller.

02:40.038 --> 02:41.054
Holla.

02:41.055 --> 02:42.097
I changed everything
about myself, Jess.

02:42.098 --> 02:45.108
I lost all the weight,
I changed my clothes,

02:45.109 --> 02:47.034
I even dropped my
voice half an octave,

02:47.035 --> 02:49.096
but it wasn't enough.

02:49.097 --> 02:51.101
I guess I'll just never
be cool enough, Jess.

02:54.118 --> 02:57.050
Okay, I've got it.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.076
- We are going to throw Schmidt
a birthday party. - No.

02:59.077 --> 03:00.101
Yes, 'cause it's
his 29th birthday

03:00.102 --> 03:02.062
and we care.

03:02.063 --> 03:04.055
Jess, Schmidt's world
is different than ours.

03:04.056 --> 03:06.029
They speak
a different language.

03:06.030 --> 03:08.058
They shorten every word
to one syllable.

03:08.059 --> 03:11.041
Okay, he once called
an oven an "ovs."

03:11.042 --> 03:14.038
- He calls an airport "airp."
- He called ketchup "ketch."

03:14.039 --> 03:15.122
Last month he went
to a party called

03:15.123 --> 03:18.075
Bros before Hos on the Moon.

03:18.076 --> 03:19.120
What does that even mean?

03:19.121 --> 03:21.068
And the dress code
was "yacht flair."

03:21.069 --> 03:22.105
- What?
- Schmidt has a friend

03:22.108 --> 03:25.046
who legally changed
his middle name to Doin' It.

03:25.047 --> 03:27.047
- Yeah, Doin' It.
- Just one word: Doinit.

03:27.050 --> 03:30.046
You are not
emotionally, mentally,

03:30.047 --> 03:34.054
and spiritually prepared
to throw these d-bags a party.

03:34.055 --> 03:35.082
I'm gonna do some research.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.047
Actually, I'm sorry,
I do have to go.

03:37.048 --> 03:38.080
- I apologize.
- Where are you going?

03:38.081 --> 03:40.055
And why are you wearing
your jury duty pants?

03:40.056 --> 03:42.121
I'm not, man, I'm just...
mumble, mumble, mumble.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.046
Come on, lawyer party...

03:44.047 --> 03:45.057
the classic fifth date.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.109
What are you talking about?

03:46.110 --> 03:48.041
I'm not gonna apologize for it.

03:48.042 --> 03:49.105
I got nothing to apologize for.

03:49.106 --> 03:51.076
- I owe you nothing.
- No, I'm having a really fun time.

03:51.079 --> 03:53.096
I love wearing
a Bill Cosby sweater

03:53.097 --> 03:55.101
in front of a bunch of lawyers
who are younger than me.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.104
Hello, I'm Bill Cosby,
do you like pudding?

03:57.105 --> 04:00.121
My son's name is Theo and
his best friend is Cockroach.

04:00.122 --> 04:02.050
That supposed to be Bill Cosby?

04:02.051 --> 04:03.109
That's as good as I can do.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.034
- Let's see yours.
- Would you like to hear

04:05.035 --> 04:06.088
- How he really sounds?
- Yes.

04:06.091 --> 04:08.029
I want to
get some more pudding.

04:08.030 --> 04:10.050
That's the worst Bill Co...
How about this?

04:10.051 --> 04:12.047
I got a daughter
named Rudy Huxtable,

04:12.048 --> 04:14.087
and she's the cutest
of all my daughters.

04:14.088 --> 04:17.033
I'm really glad that
you're here with me.

04:17.034 --> 04:18.105
Yeah, I'm happy you let me
be here with you.

04:18.106 --> 04:20.033
No, I really am because

04:20.034 --> 04:21.072
I got to, like, kiss
all the asses

04:21.072 --> 04:23.091
of these 24-year-
old law students

04:23.092 --> 04:25.050
to try to get 'em to work here.

04:25.051 --> 04:26.051
I went to law school.

04:26.052 --> 04:28.034
- You went to law school?
- Yes.

04:28.037 --> 04:30.088
- I quit. Yes.
- Quit law school... why?

04:30.089 --> 04:32.030
Because I realized
I hated lawyers.

04:32.031 --> 04:34.047
He says to the lawyer.

04:35.051 --> 04:36.068
And for some reason I find you

04:36.069 --> 04:38.104
ridiculously attractive
for saying that.

04:38.105 --> 04:41.047
Why don't you kiss
my ass, then?

04:42.055 --> 04:45.046
Look, Julia,
I got turned around.

04:45.047 --> 04:47.049
I thought we were doing
a flirty back-and-forth...

04:47.050 --> 04:48.032
I'm actually just kidding.

04:48.033 --> 04:49.047
I really do want to do that.

04:49.048 --> 04:50.050
Oh, you would?

04:50.051 --> 04:52.037
Well, we can make that happen.

04:52.038 --> 04:53.034
- Great.
- Let's go.

04:53.035 --> 04:54.049
Let's go to your place.

04:54.050 --> 04:55.051
Want to go to your place?

04:55.052 --> 04:56.125
Do you mind?

04:56.126 --> 04:58.067
Are you married or what?

04:58.068 --> 05:01.071
No, no, no, n-no, no, no, n-no,
I'm not married.

05:01.072 --> 05:03.054
I am the opposite of married.

05:03.055 --> 05:04.126
Before you, there was like,
there was like nothing.

05:04.127 --> 05:07.112
I've got, like,
no girls on the horizon.

05:07.113 --> 05:09.054
In a hot way.

05:09.055 --> 05:12.100
Why don't you ever
invite me to your place

05:12.101 --> 05:15.029
or, like, tell me all
that much about yourself?

05:15.030 --> 05:17.079
It's weird... I don't
even know where you live.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.118
I'm 30 years old,

05:18.119 --> 05:21.059
and I live in a loft
with three roommates.

05:22.076 --> 05:25.041
In a hot way.

05:25.042 --> 05:28.050
But maybe you can kiss my butt
when I talk like Bill Cosby.

05:28.051 --> 05:30.058
All right, let's go.

05:30.059 --> 05:31.113
- Is that going to work?
- Uh-huh.

05:31.116 --> 05:33.075
Wow, weird stuff
works with you.

05:33.076 --> 05:38.058
Hi, yes, I'd like to order
a last-minute stripper.

05:38.059 --> 05:42.033
Oh, um, preferably
of Asian heritage,

05:42.034 --> 05:44.100
very bendy,
with a heart of gold

05:44.101 --> 05:48.062
and a crotch of gold.

05:48.063 --> 05:49.120
Mm-hmm, yeah,
I'll hold.

05:49.121 --> 05:51.047
- Hey, Jess, Winston, this is Julia.
- Oh.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.063
- Hi.
- We're just saying hi.

05:52.066 --> 05:54.037
Nice to meet you guys.

05:54.038 --> 05:55.034
Welcome to our home.
Hold on one second.

05:55.035 --> 05:56.071
We're doing

05:56.072 --> 05:57.105
a surprise party for Schmidt.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.538
- Who is that?
- Oh, I didn't tell you

05:58.554 --> 05:59.276
about Schmidt?
- No.

05:59.366 --> 06:01.011
That's our other roommate.

06:01.363 --> 06:02.330
- Other roommate.
- You know what? You should come.

06:02.342 --> 06:03.635
- It's on Saturday.
- Yes.

06:03.663 --> 06:04.358
Cool, yeah.

06:04.372 --> 06:06.357
You should stay as far
from that party as possible.

06:06.358 --> 06:07.393
Is it like a presents thing

06:07.394 --> 06:11.371
or more like a donations
to charity situation?

06:11.372 --> 06:13.393
- No?
- Just bring yourself.

06:13.394 --> 06:15.370
Do you want to head
to my room for a little bit?

06:15.371 --> 06:16.438
Give you the rest of the tour
around the place.

06:16.439 --> 06:18.234
- Great, yeah.
- Great.

06:18.258 --> 06:19.362
Bye.

06:19.434 --> 06:21.392
Hold on one second.

06:21.393 --> 06:23.408
Hey, Winston,
why'd you do that?

06:23.409 --> 06:24.445
Are you hiding her from us?

06:24.446 --> 06:26.428
Like, are you ashamed
of your friends?

06:26.429 --> 06:28.370
100%, and you're not
my friend right now.

06:28.371 --> 06:29.391
You're my enemy,
Winston, my enemy.

06:29.392 --> 06:30.434
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss.

06:30.435 --> 06:33.375
No, that's the problem.

06:33.376 --> 06:35.367
Thank you, Ms. Phatbooty,
you're the best.

06:37.367 --> 06:39.387
Yes, I just hired
my first stripper.

06:39.388 --> 06:41.367
Anything else I should get?

06:43.000 --> 06:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:54.447 --> 06:57.426
Do you like jazz cigarettes?

06:58.426 --> 07:00.405
Hi, Tanya.

07:01.434 --> 07:03.362
Patti told me that...

07:03.363 --> 07:05.380
Patti told you to break
in my office to look for drugs?

07:08.359 --> 07:10.383
Hey, JK kidding, JK kidding.

07:10.384 --> 07:11.417
You can do whatever you want.

07:12.434 --> 07:13.443
I didn't know you liked to shop

07:13.444 --> 07:15.359
at the Confiscation Station.

07:16.401 --> 07:19.362
So what are you looking
for... grass?

07:19.363 --> 07:21.357
'Cause I can do
a locker search on Monday.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.380
Monday's too late because...

07:22.381 --> 07:27.354
Oh, so what do you got
cooking this weekend, huh?

07:27.355 --> 07:28.359
You have to tell me;
I'm your boss.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.412
What is it, a list thing,
Paperless Post?

07:30.413 --> 07:32.354
I'm free Friday,

07:32.355 --> 07:35.359
but I can also make
Saturday or Sunday work.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.374
Jess, what are you doing?

07:37.375 --> 07:38.415
I'm making
an egg yellows omelet.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.374
The shallots and gouda
are going to congeal.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.384
I can't...
what is this?

07:41.385 --> 07:44.379
Happy birthday!

07:44.380 --> 07:46.416
It's a party bus.

07:46.417 --> 07:48.384
I'm so excited.

07:54.355 --> 07:57.355
Whoa, Jess, you really did
all this for me?

07:59.355 --> 08:01.362
Okay, so...

08:01.363 --> 08:03.400
over here is kosher
yogurt and honey.

08:03.401 --> 08:04.430
- Kosher yoge?
- We got some condoms

08:04.431 --> 08:05.447
Over here... small,
medium, large,

08:05.448 --> 08:07.371
whatever your preference.

08:07.372 --> 08:08.430
- Well, I would use...
- I don't want to know.

08:08.433 --> 08:10.446
And the R-rated section
in the back

08:10.447 --> 08:12.446
with the stripper pole.

08:12.447 --> 08:14.408
It's normally used
for stability,

08:14.409 --> 08:16.392
but tonight it's
going to be used

08:16.393 --> 08:18.400
for $50 worth of seminudity.

08:18.401 --> 08:19.430
Coincidentally,

08:19.431 --> 08:21.404
I'm wearing my lap dance pants.

08:21.405 --> 08:22.226
This is, like, your world, huh?

08:22.227 --> 08:23.193
- No...
- It is.

08:23.239 --> 08:25.514
It's you in your natural
habitat, it's fascinating.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.577
I'm just here for Schmidt. I
don't know any of these people.

08:27.578 --> 08:28.629
Nicholas, what's up, N-word?

08:28.630 --> 08:30.612
Don't call me "N-word."

08:30.613 --> 08:31.648
I don't know this guy.

08:31.649 --> 08:32.671
How's your family in Chicago?

08:32.672 --> 08:34.591
Really good, thanks for asking,

08:34.592 --> 08:35.592
they're all healthy.

08:35.592 --> 08:37.640
That's good.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.633
Oh, look at this big old pile
of birthday Schmidt.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.644
Hey, do you mind if I get
a ride on your school bus?

08:43.645 --> 08:45.608
I don't want to be late
for first period.

08:47.671 --> 08:50.579
Why you got to do me
like that, Been-ja-meen?

08:51.625 --> 08:53.583
- What's up, boys?
- What up?

08:53.584 --> 08:54.644
Why don't you sing us
your birthday song?

08:54.645 --> 08:55.661
Oh, you have a birthday song?

08:55.662 --> 08:57.625
All right, all right,
guys, come on.

08:57.626 --> 08:59.616
Sing it, come on.

08:59.617 --> 09:00.654
♪ We built this Schmidty ♪

09:00.655 --> 09:03.574
♪ We built this Schmidty ♪

09:03.575 --> 09:07.583
- ♪ On rock... ♪
- ♪ On Tootsie Rolls. ♪

09:07.584 --> 09:08.573
Is that the lyrics?

09:08.574 --> 09:09.611
Yeah, we used
to make him sing that

09:09.612 --> 09:10.671
because he was fat.

09:10.672 --> 09:13.595
You know I'm just
playing at you.

09:13.596 --> 09:14.596
Yeah, hilarity,
my man, hilarity.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.632
Yeah, come on, man.

09:16.633 --> 09:17.654
You really live
with that guy, huh?

09:17.655 --> 09:19.595
Yeah, I really do.

09:19.596 --> 09:21.628
Does he, like, tuck his
shiny jeans into boots

09:21.629 --> 09:23.595
when he goes out at night?

09:23.596 --> 09:25.606
You know, the truth is,
I met Schmidt a long time ago

09:25.607 --> 09:26.663
when we were in college

09:26.664 --> 09:29.599
and he was this sweet,
chubby communications major

09:29.600 --> 09:30.654
who wore cargo shorts and...
- Yeah.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.577
I'm actually just
messing with you.

09:32.578 --> 09:33.663
Seriously, I think all
of your friends seem

09:33.664 --> 09:37.574
completely awesome and
nice and fun, so relax.

09:37.575 --> 09:39.586
You don't have to say that.

09:39.587 --> 09:41.579
-They're my friends, you can tease 'em.
-I don't want to tease them.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.631
I tease them all the time,
they don't care.

09:42.632 --> 09:43.652
Schmidt's a d-bag,

09:43.653 --> 09:45.573
you know, but, like,
not in a bad way,

09:45.574 --> 09:46.671
and, like, Jess is a total nut.

09:46.672 --> 09:48.654
- Oh...
- And Winston is like this

09:48.657 --> 09:50.653
competitive maniac

09:50.654 --> 09:53.586
who loves Sister, Sister and
he's, like, afraid of thunder.

09:53.587 --> 09:54.654
- But I'm the voice of re...
- Behind you, he's behind you,

09:54.655 --> 09:55.671
- He's behind you.
- Right now he is?

09:55.674 --> 09:57.653
Currently.

09:57.654 --> 09:59.611
And he's also one
of my best friends.

09:59.612 --> 10:00.642
Oh, no, keep going.

10:01.658 --> 10:02.671
You want to go on the bus?

10:02.672 --> 10:04.653
Yeah, let's go on the bus.

10:04.654 --> 10:06.635
I'm really sorry, man,
I was just saying that

10:06.636 --> 10:07.650
to show off for her.
- Oh, no,

10:07.653 --> 10:09.574
man, I am bringing you down.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.596
Don't bring me down.

10:12.774 --> 10:13.688
Bro juice?

10:13.705 --> 10:15.246
Vodka pom, right?

10:15.298 --> 10:17.314
Winston said it was a tradish.

10:17.315 --> 10:18.356
Look, Benjamin's smiling.

10:18.357 --> 10:20.294
Jess, you did so good.

10:21.315 --> 10:23.372
Is this stripper pole
weight-bearing?

10:23.373 --> 10:27.314
Looks like some pretty shoddy
workmanship on the cap flange.

10:27.315 --> 10:29.294
- Can I help you?
- Martin Fuller, GrindPalace.com.

10:29.297 --> 10:31.314
Hi, I'm Jessica Day.

10:31.315 --> 10:33.330
I spoke with your supervisor
on the telephone.

10:33.331 --> 10:36.334
Um, are you bringing
the stripper?

10:36.335 --> 10:39.276
'Cause I really wanted
to see her jugs first,

10:39.277 --> 10:43.293
you know, just so... um,
I do right by my bro.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.296
We have a little
miscommunicado.

10:44.297 --> 10:45.360
Did you make the call?

10:45.361 --> 10:48.334
Because if they hear a woman's
voice, then they send me.

10:48.335 --> 10:50.276
I'm your stripper, folks.

10:50.277 --> 10:52.288
Hey, need to clear this aisle.

10:52.289 --> 10:54.315
- I got to have a perimeter.
- It's a joke... no.

10:54.318 --> 10:56.323
- Please, please, please, no, you can't.
- Are you the birthday boy?

10:56.324 --> 10:57.339
You are going to love it.

10:57.340 --> 10:59.288
I do wet towel tricks.

10:59.289 --> 11:01.348
- Nobody likes wet towel tricks.
- No, he does not love wet towel tricks.

11:01.351 --> 11:03.352
- I don't judge, pal. I just want to have fun.
- We're not... No. Sir, you are not gonna...

11:03.355 --> 11:06.330
I don't want to be rude,
but, uh, times are hard.

11:06.331 --> 11:08.280
It is Saturday night,

11:08.281 --> 11:09.365
so if I get hired
to take my clothes off,

11:09.366 --> 11:11.288
I'm gonna get naked.

11:11.289 --> 11:13.279
So, I'll just put
my gym bag down,

11:13.280 --> 11:14.310
and I'll take my pants off.

11:14.311 --> 11:16.280
No, no, I'll handle it.

11:16.281 --> 11:18.305
Hey.

11:18.306 --> 11:20.343
Hey, Mr. Fuller.

11:20.344 --> 11:22.280
Mr. Fuller.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.327
- Mr. Fuller?
- Oh, no.

11:23.330 --> 11:25.347
It's getting
a little nippy out.

11:25.348 --> 11:27.359
Not a good time to start
turtling.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.360
- Come on.
- Jess, make it stop.

11:28.363 --> 11:31.284
I'm gonna pay you...

11:31.285 --> 11:35.276
$50 to never show
us your penis.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.327
But what about tips?

11:36.328 --> 11:38.293
I make my living on tips.

11:38.294 --> 11:40.318
Well, can you do anything
else for the money?

11:40.319 --> 11:43.293
I'm a baritone
at my gospel choir

11:43.294 --> 11:45.289
at First Presbyterian.

11:46.348 --> 11:49.347
Everybody, everybody...

11:49.348 --> 11:51.280
hey!

11:51.281 --> 11:52.344
Welcome to Schmidt's 29th!

11:56.285 --> 11:57.339
Safety is of
the utmost importance,

11:57.340 --> 11:59.297
so the person
sitting next to you

11:59.298 --> 12:01.314
is gonna be your bus buddy
for the night.

12:01.315 --> 12:03.288
Any time you're up and about,

12:03.289 --> 12:05.293
please wear one
of these fashion helmets.

12:05.294 --> 12:07.289
- And I brought drugs.
- Tanya has

12:07.292 --> 12:10.293
half a pot cookie,
so maybe she'll share.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.351
Okay, everybody, have fun!

12:12.352 --> 12:14.288
Martin, sing us out.

12:14.289 --> 12:16.330
♪ Oh, when he comes ♪

12:16.331 --> 12:18.372
♪ Oh, when he comes ♪

12:18.373 --> 12:20.309

12:20.310 --> 12:22.276
No stripping!

12:22.277 --> 12:23.285

12:23.286 --> 12:25.294
♪ Oh, when he comes... ♪

12:27.781 --> 12:31.097
$50. I've never put $50
in the douche bag jar.

12:31.135 --> 12:33.172
Well, that's really impressive,
Schmidt, considering.

12:34.929 --> 12:37.298
Someone's personalized condoms
just came in the mail.

12:37.386 --> 12:39.436
Hey! Jar! $20.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.411
Winston, did you know

12:42.412 --> 12:44.427
that NWA didn't stand
for "Never Walk Alone"?

12:44.428 --> 12:46.410
$30. Jar.

12:46.411 --> 12:49.356
Hey, man.

12:49.357 --> 12:52.356
No! Jar, Schmidt.

12:52.357 --> 12:54.369
- Jar!
- For what?

12:54.372 --> 12:57.444
Somehow, Schmidt, you've outdone
yourself this time.

12:57.445 --> 12:59.418
It was my birthday.

12:59.419 --> 13:02.381
I was very drunk.

13:02.382 --> 13:06.448
All right, everybody,
I think we need to take shots.

13:06.449 --> 13:10.360
A little bro-juice shot
for Benjamin!

13:10.361 --> 13:11.398
What?

13:11.399 --> 13:12.419
For Benjamin is a true...

13:12.420 --> 13:14.377
I'm the king!

13:14.378 --> 13:18.398
Winston and Nick, come and get
your bro juice!

13:18.399 --> 13:19.448
Bro juice!

13:19.449 --> 13:21.377
Bro juice! Bro juice!

13:21.378 --> 13:22.385
Bro juice?

13:22.386 --> 13:23.382
I have no idea.

13:23.383 --> 13:24.365
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.439
Nick Miller invented bro juice

13:26.440 --> 13:28.381
on Schmidt's
twenty-second

13:28.382 --> 13:30.415
birthday. Remember that?
- Bro juice.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.435
Bro juice! Bro juice!

13:32.436 --> 13:35.428
Get over here
for your bro juice!

13:39.428 --> 13:42.399
This is not gonna
be attractive.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.377
Oh, yeah!

13:46.378 --> 13:48.382
- You know, we're way too old for
this, don't you? - Oh, definitely.

13:49.403 --> 13:51.449
Happy birthday, brother.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.374
- Yeah!
- Happy birthday, Schmidty!

14:00.365 --> 14:01.389
Yeah!

14:01.390 --> 14:02.444
Bro juice!

14:02.445 --> 14:04.406
Bro juice!

14:04.407 --> 14:06.452
When I say "Par," you say "Tay."

14:07.364 --> 14:08.688
- Par.
- Tay!

14:08.785 --> 14:09.432
- Par.
- Tay!

14:09.435 --> 14:11.378
Holla!

14:12.411 --> 14:14.423
What am I doing?

14:14.424 --> 14:17.364
It makes you think, huh?

14:17.365 --> 14:18.403
Twenties... they're almost over,
man. It's crazy.

14:18.404 --> 14:20.373
Are you hitting that?

14:20.374 --> 14:21.803
- Jess?
- Yeah.

14:21.886 --> 14:22.734
No.

14:22.803 --> 14:24.365
Well, then I think
I'll help myself.

14:24.366 --> 14:26.389
To sex... with
your friend.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.368
No, no, no,
Benjamin, you can't.

14:28.369 --> 14:29.424
Not with Jess.
Please don't.

14:29.425 --> 14:31.424
Well, I can.
I can, and I will.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.389
Good evening, night owls.

14:37.390 --> 14:39.452
It's about to get bubonic
in here,

14:39.453 --> 14:42.389
for tonight, we're going to...

14:42.390 --> 14:44.368
The Plague.

14:44.369 --> 14:46.389
Sorry. Just...
It's just Plague.

14:46.390 --> 14:48.373
It's a discotheque.

14:48.374 --> 14:51.373
We'll be going there next.

14:51.374 --> 14:52.384
Whose list are you on?
Tristan's?

14:52.385 --> 14:53.428
Isn't it just like a bar

14:53.429 --> 14:55.365
or something?

14:57.369 --> 14:59.389
What do you pull down
a year in the game?

14:59.390 --> 15:01.374
Ever since I started
doing full frontal,

15:01.375 --> 15:03.381
I pull down
seven K a year easy.

15:03.382 --> 15:05.435
Why? You interested
in the life?

15:05.436 --> 15:08.377
Me? A male stripper?
Come on. You're too kind.

15:08.378 --> 15:11.373
But you know, theoretically,
if I were to get into the game,

15:11.374 --> 15:13.445
you know, what are they looking
for in the gator department?

15:13.446 --> 15:15.410
You know what I mean?

15:15.411 --> 15:18.431
Or is it just moving so fast
that it doesn't really matter?

15:18.432 --> 15:22.377
It's all about storytelling,
taking 'em on a journey.

15:22.378 --> 15:24.414
Let me ask you some basics.

15:24.415 --> 15:27.452
When you thrust, what's your
range of motion, side-to-side?

15:27.453 --> 15:30.377
Well, left... right-right.

15:30.378 --> 15:31.430
What about your testicles?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.378
Are they more or
less symmetrical?

15:33.379 --> 15:37.398
Size... yes, location... no.

15:37.399 --> 15:38.445
What about your persona?

15:38.446 --> 15:41.360
What? Fireman or a cop?

15:41.361 --> 15:42.403
I didn't ask you
your character.

15:42.404 --> 15:44.356
Your persona.

15:44.357 --> 15:45.419
I'm a Wolf-Hawk.
What are you?

15:45.420 --> 15:48.368
Luxury. Dessert.

15:48.369 --> 15:49.440
I'm a warrior poet, man.

15:49.441 --> 15:51.414
That's it.

15:51.415 --> 15:54.373
Got a number for you to call.

15:54.374 --> 15:55.445
You ever hook up
with the ladies?

15:55.446 --> 15:57.398
It's ladies,

15:57.399 --> 16:00.360
like, one out of
ten times at most.

16:00.361 --> 16:01.411
You're dancing for dudes?

16:01.412 --> 16:04.377
Yeah, I'm dancing for dudes.

16:04.378 --> 16:06.368
All right, I'm sorry, okay?

16:06.369 --> 16:08.357
You're so quiet. You're
having a terrible time.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.368
I don't mean to be.
I'm probably just intimidated.

16:11.369 --> 16:13.386
I'm sitting right next
to the inventor of bro juice.

16:13.387 --> 16:15.382
- I get it, okay?
- That's... I'm gonna brag about that.

16:15.385 --> 16:18.360
I did. I invented
bro juice, okay?

16:18.361 --> 16:20.365
- And now you want... You're done.
- What?!

16:20.368 --> 16:23.364
I get it. When we get off
the bus, it's over, I blew it.

16:23.365 --> 16:25.385
It's ridiculous.
I don't care about any of it.

16:25.386 --> 16:27.382
I really don't. Everyone's got
embarrassing stuff.

16:27.383 --> 16:30.364
I mean, I have stuff
that you don't know about.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.418
Like what?

16:31.419 --> 16:33.427
Just don't lie
to me about stuff,

16:33.428 --> 16:36.369
and we'll be fine.
- Fine.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.361
- When I work out, which isn't often,
- Uh-huh.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.364
I listen to Huey Lewis
because it pumps me up.

16:40.365 --> 16:42.406
Not ironically. Want
to hear something else?

16:42.407 --> 16:44.428
- Okay.
- I don't believe dinosaurs existed.

16:44.429 --> 16:46.390
I've seen the science.
I don't believe it.

16:46.391 --> 16:48.378
- Want to hear something else?
- No, I think I'm good.

16:48.379 --> 16:49.405
And I believe you,

16:49.406 --> 16:50.449
and I appreciate all
of this truth-telling.

16:50.450 --> 16:53.360
I don't think you have stuff.

16:53.361 --> 16:54.418
All right.

16:54.419 --> 16:56.381
You're just perfect.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.385
Uh... yeah.

16:58.386 --> 17:00.411
- Hey. Scootch.
- Oh.

17:00.414 --> 17:02.432
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

17:02.435 --> 17:04.356
So, I texted Tristan.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.410
Oh, o-okay.

17:05.411 --> 17:07.406
He said he could get us
into Plague.

17:07.407 --> 17:09.415
- Oh, that's-that's terrific.
- Yeah.

17:09.417 --> 17:11.453
- Thank you.
- Well, just you and me, of course.

17:11.455 --> 17:15.417
So why don't you ditch that zero
and get with the hero?

17:15.419 --> 17:17.373
The hero is my penis.

17:17.374 --> 17:20.367
Oh. Uh... no.

17:20.368 --> 17:21.728
- Am I bad?
- No.

17:21.757 --> 17:22.896
Hey, Benjamin.

17:22.928 --> 17:24.890
Just leave her alone.

17:26.419 --> 17:30.377
Schmidt, your party
is slugs, bro.

17:31.408 --> 17:32.540
All right, you know what?

17:32.627 --> 17:35.648
- Schmidt, this party... is the worst.
- No, man.

17:35.651 --> 17:37.610
This party is
badass, all right?

17:37.611 --> 17:39.583
Don't act like I didn't
see you over there

17:39.584 --> 17:41.573
eating on the charcut...
the charcut... the charcut?

17:41.574 --> 17:42.635
- Charcuterie.
- Charcuterie.

17:42.636 --> 17:44.571
Charcuterie. Don't act
like I didn't see you

17:44.572 --> 17:45.590
eating the charcut...
- Charcuterie.

17:45.593 --> 17:46.626
Charcuterie...

17:46.627 --> 17:48.593
Hey, you know what, Curly?

17:48.594 --> 17:49.644
You don't like the bus,
then get off it, pal.

17:49.645 --> 17:52.577
- Schmidty's birthday, bud.
- You guys suck.

17:52.578 --> 17:53.577
Let me talk to him for a sec.

17:53.578 --> 17:54.584
I'm a lawyer.

17:54.585 --> 17:55.627
- Please.
- She's a lawyer.

17:55.628 --> 17:57.571
Hi. Why don't you just
say that one more time?

17:57.572 --> 17:58.590
What? You guys suck?

18:03.590 --> 18:04.594
Look out!
Look out!

18:04.595 --> 18:05.601
Oh!

18:05.602 --> 18:06.644
- Whoa!
- Oh!

18:08.573 --> 18:09.619
Is everyone okay?

18:09.620 --> 18:11.572
Yes. No
worries, Jess.

18:11.573 --> 18:12.590
Is everybody okay?

18:12.591 --> 18:13.639
I'm so sorry.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.661
What, are you nuts?

18:14.662 --> 18:16.581
Oh, God.

18:17.661 --> 18:21.573
Who are you?

18:26.615 --> 18:28.651
Whoo!

18:28.652 --> 18:31.618
Tanya, please stop
flashing the driver.

18:31.619 --> 18:33.655
What, are you like
the Bourne Identity person?

18:33.656 --> 18:36.572
I've got these iss...

18:36.573 --> 18:38.572
like, these anger
management issues.

18:38.573 --> 18:39.631
Anger management?

18:39.632 --> 18:41.580
But I'm trying to fix it.

18:41.581 --> 18:42.633
I go to all these class...

18:42.634 --> 18:44.583
They're court-ordered
classes, but...

18:44.584 --> 18:45.644
And what was, like,
all this stuff you...?

18:45.645 --> 18:47.572
It's martial arts.

18:47.573 --> 18:48.631
I started doing martial arts,

18:48.632 --> 18:50.597
ironically, because I thought

18:50.598 --> 18:53.651
it would give me a little
bit more Zen in my life.

18:53.652 --> 18:56.576
You must be really
freaked out right now.

18:56.577 --> 18:57.665
Yes, I am really freaked out.

18:57.666 --> 19:00.585
I'm so sorry.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.576
I hate that I'm so turned on
by your craziness, but I, um...

19:07.577 --> 19:10.623
- Go with it.
- I'm going with it.

19:10.624 --> 19:12.609
You guys sure you're cool
waiting for the tow truck?

19:12.610 --> 19:14.571
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll see you back at the loft.

19:14.572 --> 19:15.598
Bye, guys.
Happy birthday.

19:15.599 --> 19:16.647
Thank you.

19:16.648 --> 19:18.580
- Bye, Julia.
- Bye, Bro Juice.

19:18.581 --> 19:19.652
- Thank you for that.
- Bro-J, my man.

19:19.655 --> 19:22.593
So, it's my birthday.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.581
- Right now?
- Right now.

19:24.582 --> 19:25.665
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Schmidt.

19:25.668 --> 19:27.664
I'm 29, folks.
What's up?

19:27.665 --> 19:29.611
29!

19:31.573 --> 19:32.618
29!

19:32.619 --> 19:35.597
Can you please not tell
anybody I just did that?

19:35.598 --> 19:37.589
That feels embarrassing.

19:37.590 --> 19:39.611
Actually, you know what?
I don't care what people think.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.684
Do you think I care too much
about what people think, Jess?

19:40.722 --> 19:43.526
- Maybe a little bit.
- Maybe.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.115
What? Did you have fun tonight?

19:45.116 --> 19:49.047
'Cause I know it was
a little bit... flawed.

19:49.048 --> 19:50.090
Jess, are you kidding me?

19:50.091 --> 19:54.056
Tonight was...
tens across the board.

19:54.057 --> 19:57.093
No splash.

19:57.094 --> 20:00.073
- Good.
- No. For real, I had...

20:00.076 --> 20:02.085
Nobody's ever done
that for me before.

20:02.086 --> 20:06.057
Any time, Schmidt. Any time.

20:10.098 --> 20:13.111
Schmidt, why are you looking
at me like that?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.090
Shh.

20:23.061 --> 20:25.050
'Cause you had... you
had fuzz on your face.

20:25.051 --> 20:26.119
- No, no, because I thought...
- Oh, my God.

20:26.122 --> 20:28.052
- You had a piece of fuzz on...
- Oh, my God! Jar.

20:28.055 --> 20:29.094
- Schmidt!
- You had a piece of fuzz, and...

20:29.097 --> 20:31.073
- It was a little piece of fuzz.
- You tried to kiss her?!

20:31.074 --> 20:32.128
It was right there and just...

20:32.129 --> 20:35.069
- Just put it in the jar, Schmidt.
- Yeah, come on. No excuses, Schmidt.

20:35.072 --> 20:39.090
Okay. For you...
for you guys.

20:44.136 --> 20:46.135
Happy birthday.

20:46.136 --> 20:48.135
29!

20:48.136 --> 20:50.106
Ten more.

20:50.107 --> 20:52.060
Sorry about that.

20:52.061 --> 20:54.078
Ah, Frankie Muniz.

20:58.044 --> 21:00.115
Ooh, Jess, I just found
a Groupon for hypnosis lessons.

21:00.116 --> 21:03.114
Think about what you can do
with that.

21:03.115 --> 21:06.082
- Sex stuff.
- Jar.

21:06.083 --> 21:08.061
Look, guys, has anyone seen
my good pea coat?

21:08.062 --> 21:10.060
Jar!

21:10.061 --> 21:13.061
- Have you seen my sharkskin
laptop sleeve? - Jar!

21:13.064 --> 21:17.043
Darn it! Has anyone seen
my croquet cleats?

21:17.044 --> 21:21.043
Hey, Jess, have you seen
my other timepiece?

21:21.044 --> 21:24.043
Nick, I came up with the best
name for an uncircumcised penis.

21:24.044 --> 21:27.082
- Bishop in a turtleneck.
- Ugh! Jar!

21:27.085 --> 21:30.040
Damn it! I can't find
my driving moccasins anywhere.
