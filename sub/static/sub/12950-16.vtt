00:03.503 --> 00:06.003
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:07.606
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:10.576
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.380
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fiancé,</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:16.782
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.283
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:20.853
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:23.379
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:23.456 --> 00:24.857
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.759
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.127
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.764
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:35.223
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.569 --> 00:39.004
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.701
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.308
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:46.877
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.514 --> 00:49.848
We know that Rambaldi was
a 16th-century inventor

00:49.849 --> 00:53.285
who seemed to have had an almost
psychic vision of technology.

00:53.353 --> 00:56.379
This book seems to be some sort
of instruction manual.

00:56.456 --> 00:59.254
You know, Sydney,
the work we're doing here...

00:59.325 --> 01:01.293
trying to figure out
who Rambaldi was,

01:01.294 --> 01:04.456
what he was working on...

01:04.531 --> 01:07.329
is becoming
an obsession for me.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.801
I'm still not sure
I'm a believer.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.071
Mr. Vaughn?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.405
Yeah.
I'm late for a meeting.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.204
You're gonna want
to cancel that meeting.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.776
We figured out how to read
the Rambaldi document.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.646
All right.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.775
I have the page with me,
and I'd like you to see it.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.985
Okay.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.464 --> 02:13.964
Exactly who
is this Sydney Bristow,

02:13.967 --> 02:16.959
and why should this committee's
time be spent on her?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.505
She's a double agent, Senator.

02:19.506 --> 02:24.944
A CIA asset working undercover
as an operative of SD-6.

02:33.019 --> 02:36.011
Last week, we came into
possession of that drawing

02:36.089 --> 02:38.887
from a manuscript belonging
to Milo Rambaldi.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.692
Rambaldi.

02:40.693 --> 02:43.685
Ms. Evans, we've been
all over this.

02:54.574 --> 02:57.074
Look at the partially
decoded text.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.445
Senator, it's written
by Rambaldi

03:00.446 --> 03:03.142
in reference to that woman
in the drawing.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.754
Sir, I understand
your reluctance

03:43.823 --> 03:46.656
to invest our resources
in this matter...

03:46.726 --> 03:49.226
Dr. Evans...

03:52.432 --> 03:54.932
What do you need?

04:02.141 --> 04:05.872
<i>Vaughn, I'm back from Brazil.</i>

04:06.813 --> 04:09.941
<i>I did what SD-6 wanted.</i>

04:10.016 --> 04:12.284
<i>Got surveillance photos
of someone they think</i>

04:12.285 --> 04:15.083
<i>might be "The Man. "</i>

04:15.154 --> 04:17.654
<i>I'll forward them to you
as usual</i>

04:17.656 --> 04:20.156
<i>and wait
for further instructions.</i>

04:27.734 --> 04:29.835
Who the hell are you?

04:29.836 --> 04:32.336
Carson Evans. DSR.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.041
We have authorization.

04:36.042 --> 04:38.806
The National Security Agency's
investigating Bristow?

04:38.878 --> 04:41.013
The Department
of Special Research, yes.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.781
Off the books, paranormal guys,

04:42.782 --> 04:44.516
because her picture
was in a manuscript?

04:44.517 --> 04:45.951
That's special access only.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.519
I'm Sydney's case officer.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.318
The loop is closed on this
on orders from the DCI himself.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.823
I don't care
who issued the orders.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.418
If the NSA knows something,
I should, too.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.994
We should, sir.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.931
Unless you already do.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.370
Close the door.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.253
I got your message.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.621
If this is about
the surveillance photos,

05:22.622 --> 05:24.056
I encoded them onto JPEGs.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.691
Forget the surveillance photos.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.459
The ones that might
identify "The Man"?

05:27.460 --> 05:30.691
The ones I nearly got eaten by
a pack of dogs trying to get?

05:30.763 --> 05:32.597
You're being investigated
by the DSR.

05:32.598 --> 05:33.999
DSR?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.667
Department of Special Research.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.102
It was created
during World War II

05:37.103 --> 05:39.438
to investigate Nazi interest
in the occult.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.939
After the war,
an executive order was signed,

05:41.941 --> 05:45.206
empowering them to investigate
fringe science.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.279
Parapsychology, remote viewing.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.647
What do they want with me?

05:48.648 --> 05:50.916
They want to know why your
picture's in the Rambaldi book.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.684
No, I know, it seems ridiculous.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.919
It is ridiculous.

05:53.920 --> 05:54.920
But your picture...

05:54.921 --> 05:57.356
- A picture. Not mine.
- They don't think so.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.257
- They're wrong.
- They took my files.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.659
Everything I have
concerning you.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.260
At our next debriefing,

06:02.261 --> 06:04.596
they're gonna bring you in
for questioning.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.965
This drawing is 500 years old.

06:06.966 --> 06:08.900
Millions of women
have looked like that.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.369
My mom looked like that.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.837
Maybe it's a picture
of my mother.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.338
Well, they don't think so.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.307
Your mother's dead,
and they have reason to believe

06:15.308 --> 06:17.109
the woman in this picture
is still alive.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.176
I don't understand.

06:18.177 --> 06:22.113
DSR partially decoded text
from that page.

06:22.181 --> 06:23.181
And?

06:23.182 --> 06:25.050
What did it say?

06:25.051 --> 06:27.952
Well, they didn't tell me,
but apparently,

06:28.020 --> 06:30.389
Rambaldi refers to future dates
indicating this woman

06:30.390 --> 06:31.890
is still alive.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.418
The DSR is referring
to this text by name.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.063
They're calling it
"The Prophecy. "

07:19.338 --> 07:23.206
I want to stress, at the outset,
this is not an interrogation.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.710
You are not the subject
of a criminal inquiry.

07:25.711 --> 07:28.407
Our purpose is simply to
gather background information.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.981
I'd like to note for the record

07:30.983 --> 07:33.251
how much we appreciate
your cooperation in this matter.

07:33.252 --> 07:35.487
Do you have any questions?

07:35.488 --> 07:38.355
Yes. Just one.

07:38.424 --> 07:41.188
Are you really not going to
tell me what this prophecy says?

07:41.260 --> 07:43.328
I think we've been over that.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.561
Yes, we have,
just not to my satisfaction.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.270
Dr. Waterson.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.906
Yes.

07:56.509 --> 07:57.909
Agent Bristow.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.410
Sydney's fine.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.348
Question one.

08:05.017 --> 08:08.145
What would be the next picture
in this series?

08:11.224 --> 08:13.724
"D."

08:13.793 --> 08:16.127
Study this figure.

08:16.128 --> 08:19.427
If it was rotated 180 degrees,

08:19.499 --> 08:22.263
it would look like
which of the following?

08:27.073 --> 08:29.573
"C."

08:32.445 --> 08:34.379
What is the next image
in this series?

08:34.380 --> 08:36.681
Mmm. Love the tech stuff.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.682
Haladki.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.017
It's like a thermometer.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.748
Heat from their eyes
tracks brain patterns.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.488
What are you doing here?

08:43.489 --> 08:44.856
My department got tapped

08:44.857 --> 08:47.485
to facilitate interagency
cooperation.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.495
"Q" and 7.

08:50.496 --> 08:52.097
You're in a forest.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.760
You come to a river.
Do you cross it?

08:59.705 --> 09:02.902
Agent Bristow,
would you cross it?

09:08.281 --> 09:10.781
I don't know. It depends.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.814
Gentlemen, if you need anything,
I'll be in my office.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.858
What is going on
in this picture?

10:06.205 --> 10:08.506
The mother is teaching the girl
how to bake.

10:08.507 --> 10:11.738
And what feelings
does this picture evoke?

10:13.179 --> 10:15.113
The girl doesn't like it.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.614
She wants to go out and play.

10:25.524 --> 10:28.220
- We need to cut this short.
- What is it?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.854
Sorry.
"Need to know" only.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.348
Would you be willing
to come with us, please?

10:50.349 --> 10:50.949
Why?

10:50.950 --> 10:54.078
We have some physical
examination we need to do.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.453
Excuse me?

10:55.454 --> 10:58.855
General tests. An MRI,
lumbar puncture, blood work.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.392
What the hell's going on?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.761
No, I don't think so.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.562
It would be better
for you to submit now.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.097
I have answered every question
you have asked,

11:06.098 --> 11:08.366
no matter how ridiculous,
but that's as far as this goes.

11:08.367 --> 11:11.097
You want to touch me,
you have to tell me everything.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.837
Starting with what
this prophecy says.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.807
I'm sorry. You don't have
clearance for that information.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.676
You are wasting your time

11:17.677 --> 11:20.177
taking this Rambaldi thing
so seriously.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.841
There are real threats
in this world.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.416
I have work to do.

11:29.221 --> 11:31.222
You move out of my way,

11:31.223 --> 11:34.056
or I will make you
move out of my way.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.333
Thank you.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.137
They're just letting her leave?

11:52.244 --> 11:54.379
Third-row seats?
Yep.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.147
Behind the Lakers bench.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.582
Wait, wait.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.217
- Near Kobe?
- Yeah.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.019
A friend of mine has a contact,

12:01.020 --> 12:03.388
so he scored them
free of charge.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.983
- I'm gonna be sitting near Kobe?
- Yes.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.118
Are you sure you're asking
the right roommate?

12:11.497 --> 12:13.598
As is sometimes
painfully obvious,

12:13.599 --> 12:16.099
I know something about wanting
somebody you can't have.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.136
For a couple hours,
you come with me

12:18.137 --> 12:19.571
and you forget
about hating Charlie.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.438
Sounds good.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.073
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.702
I had a dream last night
about a fortune teller.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.611
He said he had a prophecy
about me.

12:26.612 --> 12:27.779
What was it?

12:27.780 --> 12:31.773
I don't know, but that's
the word he used. Prophecy.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.952
Does that sound good or bad?

12:33.953 --> 12:35.253
Prophecy?

12:35.254 --> 12:37.288
Yeah.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.789
- Definitely bad.
- Yeah. Bad.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.794
Syd, who cares?

12:42.795 --> 12:45.295
- It's just a dream.
- I know.

12:45.331 --> 12:48.789
Thanks for the breakfast.
See you, guys.

12:50.202 --> 12:52.070
Using all available resources,

12:52.071 --> 12:54.972
we finally tracked down
the enemy who we no longer

12:55.040 --> 12:57.600
have to refer to as "The Man. "

12:57.710 --> 12:59.544
Thanks to these
surveillance photos

12:59.545 --> 13:02.045
you obtained in Brazil,
we have confirmed his identity.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.614
He is Alexander Khasinau.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.518
Khasinau was the recipient
of the Sark communiqué

13:06.519 --> 13:09.420
reporting on the loss
of the Rambaldi manuscript.

13:09.488 --> 13:12.685
Highly decorated former
lieutenant colonel of the KGB.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.292
Khasinau went underground.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.728
He's long rumored to be a power
broker for the Russian Mafia

13:16.729 --> 13:18.163
in its affairs with rogue states

13:18.164 --> 13:19.798
in the international
arms bazaar.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.699
We're up against
the Russian Mafia.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.334
As a source of financing, maybe,

13:23.335 --> 13:25.929
but in terms of tactics,
reach, and sophistication,

13:26.038 --> 13:27.405
Khasinau's organization

13:27.406 --> 13:30.341
operates on an entirely
different order of magnitude.

13:30.409 --> 13:32.477
So what's next?

13:32.478 --> 13:34.612
Nothing.

13:34.613 --> 13:35.847
After being identified,

13:35.848 --> 13:38.715
he moved his base of operation
to an undisclosed location.

13:38.784 --> 13:41.378
He knows he's a target.

13:41.453 --> 13:45.048
The next move we make must be
made with extreme caution.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.624
So no mission?

13:48.327 --> 13:51.558
Actually, I do have
to ask you something.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.264
It's a personal favor.

13:53.265 --> 13:56.632
These last few days haven't
been very good for Emily.

13:56.702 --> 13:59.398
When you came to the house,

13:59.505 --> 14:03.168
I hadn't seen her spirits
that high in a long time.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.310
So if you wouldn't mind
calling her

14:05.311 --> 14:08.405
or perhaps paying a visit,
saying hello.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.148
Of course.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.050
Thank you.

14:12.051 --> 14:16.317
And when we know the right move
to make with Mr. Khasinau,

14:16.388 --> 14:18.888
we'll make it.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.895
I want Khasinau dead.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.267
The Alliance doesn't know
what the hell it wants.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.603
They're having a meeting
in London on Tuesday

14:31.604 --> 14:34.164
to resolve whether or not
The Alliance should invest

14:34.273 --> 14:37.265
all the necessary resources
to find and kill Khasinau.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.077
It makes sense.

14:39.078 --> 14:43.037
Members from the old Soviet bloc
still control 5 of the 12 votes.

14:43.115 --> 14:45.016
They're cold warriors

14:45.017 --> 14:47.118
who prefer the paradigm
of détente.

14:47.119 --> 14:49.619
They'll likely reject
going to war with Khasinau.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.521
Those five men are cowards.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.151
All of them.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.995
Of the seven remaining members,

14:56.996 --> 14:58.830
there are only four
that I know for certain

14:58.831 --> 15:00.498
who will vote in favor
of aggressive action.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.161
Essentially, three men control
the outcome of this vote.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.536
Khasinau sent men
into this facility.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.037
They stole from us.
They killed some of us.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.573
There should be no vote
in the first place.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.143
What's your strategy?

15:14.079 --> 15:17.606
Edward Poole.
Oversees SD-9.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.351
He's one
of the three swing votes.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.756
I'll start with him.

15:27.726 --> 15:29.727
- Hello?
- Edward?

15:29.728 --> 15:32.891
Arvin.
Good to hear your voice.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.599
Yes, Edward, you too.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.800
How have you been?

15:35.801 --> 15:38.998
I think we've all been better.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.772
I'm seeing you on Tuesday?

15:40.773 --> 15:44.709
As a matter of fact, Edward,
that's why I'm calling you.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.439
Your position on Khasinau.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.714
Am I right to assume
that you'll be supporting

15:49.715 --> 15:52.215
a declaration of war
against him?

15:53.519 --> 15:57.387
I'm flattered you would
think me so forgiving.

16:01.593 --> 16:04.460
But Khasinau must pay
for what he's done,

16:04.530 --> 16:07.328
even if I have to take care
of it myself.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.167
Good.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.336
I'm glad to hear that.

16:11.337 --> 16:15.774
Unfortunately, The Alliance
is nearly split on this issue.

16:15.841 --> 16:19.299
Now, as far as I'm aware,
there are two swing votes left.

16:19.411 --> 16:22.778
Oscar Dunst, Jean Briault.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.715
So, Edward,
it's up to you and me

16:25.784 --> 16:28.284
to take the appropriate action.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.154
What are you suggesting?

16:30.155 --> 16:35.354
I have personally seen
what Khasinau is capable of.

16:35.427 --> 16:39.295
I will not let
his aggression go unanswered.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.959
So what I'm suggesting, Edward,

16:42.034 --> 16:45.993
is that we do
whatever must be done

16:46.071 --> 16:50.405
to ensure that this declaration
of war be ratified.

16:50.476 --> 16:54.276
Yes, I was going to wait
and present this at the meeting.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.880
What's that?

16:55.881 --> 17:00.250
Under the circumstances, I think
I should come to Los Angeles.

17:00.319 --> 17:03.220
I have some intel
you should see.

17:03.288 --> 17:04.288
Good.

17:04.289 --> 17:06.023
I'll be there in the morning.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.525
Okay.

17:18.404 --> 17:22.363
Arvin's such a sweetheart,
asking you to look in like this.

17:22.473 --> 17:25.637
I would've come anyway,
but I didn't want to bother you.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.211
Not at all.

17:28.280 --> 17:32.148
I really liked meeting
your friend, by the way.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.918
Yeah, he's a great guy.

17:33.919 --> 17:36.649
I think he thinks
you're pretty great, too.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.191
He and I are just friends.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.926
He's cute.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.394
He is cute.

17:43.395 --> 17:47.354
I know it's been awhile,
but I still feel guilty

17:47.433 --> 17:49.933
even talking about dating again.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.934
It must be especially hard
doing what you do.

18:06.718 --> 18:07.718
It is.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.219
It's difficult sometimes.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.057
I mean working for my husband.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.427
Oh. Well...

18:16.428 --> 18:19.363
I know this has been difficult
for Arvin.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.931
My illness.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.199
I look just like everyone else,
and I usually feel that way.

18:27.306 --> 18:30.867
The fact is...

18:30.976 --> 18:33.476
I won't be alive next Christmas.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.980
Don't say that.
You don't know that.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.817
I do.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.122
For a long time
I ignored the pain.

18:44.123 --> 18:50.585
Then one morning over there,
I collapsed.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.222
Woke up in the hospital.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.960
The doctor told me.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.534
Cancer.

18:59.371 --> 19:03.569
He said if I had seen him
in the beginning,

19:03.642 --> 19:06.634
I probably could've survived.

19:06.745 --> 19:11.876
But there's a fear like nothing
I've ever felt before

19:11.950 --> 19:14.318
that comes over you

19:14.319 --> 19:18.016
when you know that there's
something really wrong.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.729
For four months, I did nothing.

19:24.730 --> 19:28.359
I was so terrified
of what I didn't know.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.335
So terrified
that I was paralyzed.

19:35.741 --> 19:40.542
And the longer that went on,
the more terrified I got.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.513
Wanting to know the truth,

19:42.514 --> 19:46.974
but being too afraid
to find the answers.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.838
Go ahead.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.775
Run all the tests you want.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.052
What I'm about to tell you,

20:21.053 --> 20:24.318
you may find difficult
to believe.

20:24.389 --> 20:28.223
Arvin, I know that
Jean Briault is a friend.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.328
Yes, he is a friend.

20:30.329 --> 20:34.857
A friend of yours,
but not of The Alliance.

20:38.270 --> 20:42.570
The other man in the photo
is your friend Jean Briault.

20:45.310 --> 20:49.076
This only means that Khasinau
and Briault know each other.

20:49.147 --> 20:51.647
There's nothing more.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.914
On the left
is a brokerage account

20:56.989 --> 20:59.323
in the name of Briault's wife.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.558
On the right,

21:00.559 --> 21:04.723
a holding company that Khasinau
uses to launder money.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.564
As you will see, five deposits

21:06.565 --> 21:08.599
in excess of $45 million
were made

21:08.600 --> 21:11.933
into the brokerage account
in the past three months.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.171
Arvin, I would not have
made this trip

21:15.173 --> 21:16.707
if I did not truly believe

21:16.708 --> 21:19.768
that Khasinau had infiltrated
The Alliance

21:19.878 --> 21:24.042
and that Briault
was in his pocket.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.916
No.

21:25.917 --> 21:29.819
I was in Chile with this man
under Aliende.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.388
He recruited me.

21:34.259 --> 21:35.760
Well, on the other hand,

21:35.761 --> 21:38.261
Briault's always seemed
a good man,

21:38.297 --> 21:40.298
and he has served
The Alliance well.

21:40.299 --> 21:45.601
So maybe we should
just gamble, do nothing.

21:45.704 --> 21:49.538
Just play it out
and see what happens.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.776
If this vote goes the wrong way

21:51.777 --> 21:55.804
because one of our members
has been bought,

21:55.881 --> 21:57.682
it would mean
the end of The Alliance.

21:57.683 --> 22:02.518
But Briault, as you know,
is a famously cautious man.

22:02.587 --> 22:04.422
A hit would have to be
carried out

22:04.423 --> 22:06.257
by someone who had access.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.954
Someone that Briault
would agree to meet alone.

22:09.027 --> 22:10.795
A friend.

22:10.796 --> 22:15.324
If a hit occurs, yes.

22:17.135 --> 22:18.869
No.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.905
No.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.239
This can't be right.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.740
There's another explanation
for this intel.

22:24.843 --> 22:28.210
So I appreciate your coming here
this long way

22:28.280 --> 22:31.443
with this information, but...

22:35.287 --> 22:38.415
...I can't believe that
Jean Briault is a traitor.

22:40.759 --> 22:44.217
No one hopes you are right
more than I.

22:49.601 --> 22:51.602
I'd like to officially welcome
to Los Angeles

22:51.603 --> 22:53.404
our friends from Washington.

22:53.405 --> 22:56.704
I have always had a fascination
with the work of the DSR.

22:56.775 --> 22:59.744
And although
interagency cooperation

22:59.811 --> 23:01.779
is notoriously problematic,

23:01.780 --> 23:05.443
I don't foresee any difficulty
while you're working here

23:05.517 --> 23:08.111
in our offices.

23:08.186 --> 23:10.354
I speak for everyone
on our side

23:10.355 --> 23:11.989
when I say how much we
appreciate your help

23:11.990 --> 23:13.124
in this matter.

23:13.125 --> 23:17.186
That said, let me pay you
the courtesy of being blunt.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.397
To date, our requests for files

23:19.398 --> 23:21.766
considerably more
comprehensive than these

23:21.767 --> 23:23.634
have not been processed.

23:23.635 --> 23:27.230
Those requests, Miss Evans,
are being assessed.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.673
The directive doesn't provide
for assessments.

23:29.674 --> 23:32.438
I don't mind you coming here
and working with us, but...

23:32.511 --> 23:34.412
Let's just be clear.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.080
You don't work with us.
You work for us.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.606
To presume you're in charge,
we have protocols...

23:38.683 --> 23:42.676
- The directive specifies...
- This is my office!

23:43.822 --> 23:46.416
Yes, the directive
gives you the authority

23:46.491 --> 23:47.858
to take her into custody.

23:47.859 --> 23:50.359
But Sydney Bristow
is well-placed.

23:52.130 --> 23:56.863
And she has provided the Agency
with valuable intelligence.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.904
I understand this so-called
prophecy is interesting

23:59.971 --> 24:03.839
and that these times
require us to be vigilant

24:03.942 --> 24:06.377
against any perceived threats
to our national security,

24:06.378 --> 24:09.211
but let's take a step back
for a second.

24:09.281 --> 24:14.275
This is a 500-year-old text,
and based on that text,

24:14.352 --> 24:17.344
we are treating Agent Bristow
like a lab rat.

24:17.422 --> 24:19.922
Now, I am all
for being prudent.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.627
But what we're doing...

24:23.628 --> 24:26.529
the way that we are doing it
is absurd!

24:32.404 --> 24:35.532
We should investigate, yes,
but not persecute.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.144
Excuse me.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.012
I understand
that dissenting right now

24:42.013 --> 24:43.581
might not be the best move
for my career,

24:43.582 --> 24:45.950
but I need to say something.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.751
Steven Haladki, ma'am.
Domestic Resources Division.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.449
For months, I've been worried
about Bristow.

24:52.524 --> 24:55.721
At first, my concern was simply
that her handler

24:55.794 --> 24:58.695
was too emotionally involved,
which I still contest,

24:58.763 --> 25:01.527
but then I started getting
concerned about Bristow herself.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.868
Look through her file.
There are discrepancies.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.436
There are some
significant questions.

25:05.437 --> 25:08.406
As an example, Bristow met
with a Rambaldi disciple

25:08.473 --> 25:10.007
on the Amalfi coast

25:10.008 --> 25:12.376
at exactly the time
his death was prophesied.

25:12.377 --> 25:18.009
After reading what Rambaldi's
written about Bristow,

25:18.083 --> 25:19.950
excuse me, but I am terrified.

25:19.951 --> 25:24.115
Haladki, you are assuming that
Rambaldi's prophecy is accurate

25:24.189 --> 25:26.223
and that he was referring
to Bristow in the first place.

25:26.224 --> 25:28.592
Let's say Rambaldi was wrong
or that he was right

25:28.593 --> 25:30.194
and it wasn't Bristow
he was talking about.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.595
Fantastic.

25:31.596 --> 25:33.297
But that's why
we're testing her,

25:33.298 --> 25:35.065
to see if she's got
the physical anomalies

25:35.066 --> 25:36.867
that Rambaldi mentions
in the prophecy.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.869
It's like "666," guys.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.404
You see the writing
on the kid's scalp,

25:40.405 --> 25:42.905
you know there's
some problems at home.

25:48.980 --> 25:50.281
Thanks for coming.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.116
Are you all right?
I heard about the tests.

25:52.117 --> 25:53.717
This prophecy.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.886
Do you know anything about it?
What it says?

25:55.887 --> 25:57.121
No.

25:57.122 --> 25:58.689
But the DSR was close to a panic

25:58.690 --> 26:00.391
when they had only half
of it decoded.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.926
They cracked the rest
this morning.

26:01.927 --> 26:04.521
That's what I wanted to ask.
They need a code key.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.397
Do they have the right one?

26:06.398 --> 26:09.231
The DSR spent years trying
to decipher Rambaldi's work.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.429
The key they're using is one
they reverse-engineered.

26:13.805 --> 26:17.832
If the DSR is misreading
that text,

26:17.943 --> 26:19.777
they're gonna take me
into custody,

26:19.778 --> 26:22.278
which would blow my cover
with SD-6.

26:23.048 --> 26:25.608
And probably yours.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.785
You want Rambaldi's
original code key.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.423
If it exists.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.557
It does.

26:33.558 --> 26:36.686
But the Agency won't go after
it, for political reasons.

26:37.295 --> 26:39.795
Dad, what does that mean?

26:39.965 --> 26:42.525
The code key is in the Vatican.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.271
Think about what this means
for Sydney.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.106
Doing nothing shouldn't be
an option.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.708
You're asking me to authorize
an operation

26:50.709 --> 26:52.810
that goes deliberately
against the DSR's work!

26:52.811 --> 26:54.178
Then classify it as recon.

26:54.179 --> 26:55.446
Langley won't approve that.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.881
The DSR is being irresponsible
and overreactive.

26:57.882 --> 26:59.984
One thing you don't have to do
is attack the DSR.

26:59.985 --> 27:02.386
Those bastards have just about
taken over this office.

27:02.387 --> 27:03.787
This is the chance
to prove them wrong.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.123
Langley is watching us closely!

27:06.124 --> 27:09.924
It's a discretionary op.
You're arguing semantics.

27:12.197 --> 27:13.764
If she weren't my daughter,

27:13.765 --> 27:16.290
I probably wouldn't be
fighting for this.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.826
I understand this prophecy
is special access,

27:19.904 --> 27:23.340
but those who have it might be
misreading that text.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.877
I'd go myself,
but Sloane's headed to London.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.403
I'm overseeing operations
at SD-6 while he's away.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.382
I don't have to tell you
what an opportunity that is.

27:33.151 --> 27:38.384
So, Ben,
I need your help on this.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.527
Hello?

28:16.528 --> 28:19.028
Edward, it's Arvin.

28:19.064 --> 28:20.464
Any news?

28:20.465 --> 28:23.229
We can't risk Briault.

28:23.301 --> 28:26.134
Please don't talk
about this with anyone.

28:26.237 --> 28:28.572
Don't share your intel.

28:28.573 --> 28:30.507
All right.

28:30.508 --> 28:35.070
I've decided to take care
of our problem myself.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.646
I understand.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.392
You're gonna break
into the Vatican?

28:48.393 --> 28:49.727
The last thing I'm gonna do

28:49.728 --> 28:51.795
while DSR is waiting
for test results to prove

28:51.796 --> 28:54.663
I'm guilty of something I don't
understand is sit on my ass.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.633
- But the Vatican?
- The secret archives.

28:56.634 --> 28:58.001
All I have
is an inventory number.

28:58.002 --> 28:59.336
They don't know the form
the code key's in.

28:59.337 --> 29:02.204
It's Rambaldi,
so it could be anything.

29:03.341 --> 29:05.841
I called you because I need
a partner for this op.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.410
Someone I can trust.

29:09.147 --> 29:10.881
We'd have to fly out separately.

29:10.882 --> 29:12.316
Different airports in Italy.

29:12.317 --> 29:14.817
We'd have to leave tonight.

29:17.288 --> 29:19.788
You in?

29:24.863 --> 29:26.130
Yeah.

29:26.131 --> 29:28.631
I'll break into the Vatican
with you.

29:35.673 --> 29:38.008
Did you know his parents
named him after steak?

29:38.009 --> 29:40.876
Kobe. They saw it
on a Japanese menu.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.279
No, I didn't know that.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.914
He's the perfect guy
for someone like me.

29:43.915 --> 29:46.440
Plays ball and named after food.

29:47.418 --> 29:49.918
What would be excellent
about leaving tonight

29:49.954 --> 29:52.650
is that we might actually
get to see some of the game.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.691
- I'm not going half-done.
- She's obsessed.

29:54.692 --> 29:56.026
You think?

29:56.027 --> 29:58.723
So, did that thing come true?

29:58.797 --> 29:59.963
The dream?

29:59.964 --> 30:02.464
The prophecy.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.568
Not yet.

30:04.569 --> 30:07.333
I got to go.
I got to make my plane.

30:07.438 --> 30:08.672
Have a great time at the game,

30:08.673 --> 30:10.240
and I'll see you guys
when I get back.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.409
Where's the world of
international corporate banking

30:12.410 --> 30:14.910
taking you to this time?

30:15.814 --> 30:18.314
Boston.

30:49.113 --> 30:52.378
Unh, unh, unh!

31:00.425 --> 31:02.726
Oh. Unh-unh!

31:13.538 --> 31:15.472
So, I was thinking,
we're in Rome,

31:15.473 --> 31:18.067
which is the same city
as Trattoria de Nardi.

31:18.176 --> 31:19.276
What's that?

31:19.277 --> 31:21.777
It's my favorite
restaurant in the world.

31:21.779 --> 31:24.279
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:36.694 --> 31:39.029
So, why is Trattoria de Nardi
so good?

31:39.030 --> 31:40.664
It's only good if you like food.

31:40.665 --> 31:42.966
Did you know Kobe Bryant
was named for a steak?

31:42.967 --> 31:44.301
Yeah, actually, I did.

31:44.302 --> 31:46.637
You said the explosion
will trigger the alarm.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.305
Which is on a 15-second delay.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.407
You said you could
disarm it in under 20 seconds.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.842
How far under 20?

31:51.843 --> 31:54.343
I work better under pressure.

31:59.183 --> 32:01.084
I was thinking later tonight

32:01.085 --> 32:04.452
when we get the code key,
maybe we can check it out.

32:04.522 --> 32:05.789
What, the restaurant?

32:05.790 --> 32:08.225
It's almost too good not to.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.494
Unless SD-6 spots us there
and has us killed.

32:10.495 --> 32:13.089
The food's so good,
it's almost worth the risk.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.740
Okay, it's set.
Let's go.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.780
Ready?

33:01.379 --> 33:04.143
<i># Do what I want
'cause I can and if I don't #</i>

33:04.215 --> 33:06.740
<i># Because I wanna #</i>

33:08.886 --> 33:11.480
<i># Be ignored by the stiff
and the bored #</i>

33:11.556 --> 33:14.056
<i># Because I'm gonna #</i>

33:15.827 --> 33:17.394
This is Pope Alexander VI.

33:17.395 --> 33:19.363
Rambaldi was
his chief architect.

33:19.364 --> 33:22.162
Rambaldi made a habit of hiding
his work in ordinary things.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.034
The code is hidden
in this painting.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.769
We don't have time.
We'll take it with us.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.704
Wait a minute.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.205
Give me the flashlight.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.872
Begin with the 11 th letter.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.582
Three rows of 16
along the "X" axis,

33:38.583 --> 33:40.050
and then another 42.

33:40.051 --> 33:41.651
This is the code key.

33:41.652 --> 33:44.152
I got it.

33:46.391 --> 33:49.883
<i># Now it's all out
and you knew #</i>

33:49.961 --> 33:51.228
<i># 'Cause I wanted to #</i>

34:06.210 --> 34:08.710
He was sending for backup.
We got to move!

34:18.856 --> 34:21.380
I understand Poole was here.
Is he with us?

34:22.726 --> 34:25.094
Where the hell is Sydney?

34:25.096 --> 34:27.596
I believe
she's at the university.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.734
We just got word
from Kleinhoff in Munich.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.500
There's a counterfeit page
in Rambaldi's manuscript.

34:35.606 --> 34:36.706
Counterfeit?

34:36.706 --> 34:38.608
That's right. Page 47.
There's nothing on it.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.210
We had it tested.

34:40.210 --> 34:43.543
Doesn't match any of the other
pages in the manuscript.

34:43.614 --> 34:47.277
Now, the number 47 had special
significance for Rambaldi.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.851
In all his writings, page 47
had critical information.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.222
I want to know
why we don't have that page.

34:52.223 --> 34:54.723
I'll tell Sydney
when she comes in.

34:55.326 --> 34:57.794
Her schoolwork
is a liability, Jack.

34:57.795 --> 35:01.663
She's familiar
with your opinion.

35:01.732 --> 35:04.232
Her education
is important to her.

35:04.235 --> 35:07.363
Your daughter needs
to re-examine her priorities.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.273
You're leaving for London
a day earlier than expected.

35:11.342 --> 35:14.277
I believe we have
the necessary votes.

35:14.345 --> 35:15.612
When I get back,

35:15.613 --> 35:18.912
The Alliance will officially
be at war with Khasinau.

35:18.983 --> 35:22.714
I want you to follow up
with Kleinhoff while I'm gone.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.688
I want to know
what happened to that page.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.423
Done.

35:26.424 --> 35:29.018
Tell Sydney
that she and I need to talk.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.072
Mmm.

36:16.073 --> 36:19.065
Look at us, Jean.
Two old men.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.635
I feel younger now
than I ever felt when I was 18.

36:22.747 --> 36:25.841
With age I've become
more comfortable.

36:25.917 --> 36:29.478
Listen, Jean, I want
to apologize to you

36:29.554 --> 36:32.054
for asking you
to keep this so secret,

36:32.056 --> 36:36.322
but this business
that we have to discuss

36:36.394 --> 36:38.894
is extremely sensitive.

36:39.597 --> 36:42.430
Look, while I am intrigued,

36:42.500 --> 36:48.769
right now I am more interested
in my new grandson.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.373
8 pounds, 9 ounces.

36:51.409 --> 36:52.909
He's big.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.708
He has my chin.

36:55.780 --> 36:58.647
But he's better-looking than me.

37:10.127 --> 37:12.627
What is it?

37:41.759 --> 37:44.819
As you know, we have
suffered another tragedy

37:44.895 --> 37:47.887
in what is already
a difficult time.

37:47.965 --> 37:50.333
I would like to begin
by observing a moment of silence

37:50.334 --> 37:53.064
for our friend
and colleague Jean Briault.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.042
We come together today
to make a decision.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.481
Alexander Khasinau is our enemy.

38:06.550 --> 38:10.042
He and his operatives
are a powerful force.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.888
Aggressive and brutal.

38:11.889 --> 38:15.484
But we have managed to coexist
with our opposition for years.

38:15.559 --> 38:19.359
So the choice is clear.

38:19.430 --> 38:22.524
Either we choose
to respond with force,

38:22.600 --> 38:26.593
equally sharing the burden of
cost, manpower, and equipment,

38:26.704 --> 38:29.434
or we choose to seek
a diplomatic détente.

38:31.575 --> 38:35.011
So, let us now vote.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.288
6 votes to 5.

38:45.289 --> 38:48.087
We have resolved
to reject aggressive action.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.356
We will now seek
through all diplomatic channels

38:51.429 --> 38:54.125
contacts with Mr. Khasinau.

38:54.198 --> 38:56.996
Once those contacts
have been established...

39:07.978 --> 39:10.113
It wasn't Briault getting
paid off by Khasinau, was it?

39:10.114 --> 39:11.848
It was you.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.716
You doctored the photos,
you manipulated those accounts.

39:14.785 --> 39:16.519
Arvin.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.020
You're upset.
You lost a friend.

39:19.056 --> 39:20.724
Conversations
were never recorded.

39:20.725 --> 39:22.525
We talked on secure lines.

39:22.526 --> 39:25.256
You made sure I met Briault
in secret.

39:25.996 --> 39:28.398
You used me.

39:28.399 --> 39:32.130
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.737
I will repay the favor.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.378
Give my regards to Emily.

40:20.551 --> 40:23.051
- How was your flight?
- It was okay.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.254
Have you sent in the pictures?

40:24.255 --> 40:25.955
Yeah, and in a couple of hours,

40:25.956 --> 40:27.657
we'll know exactly what
Rambaldi wrote.

40:27.658 --> 40:30.718
The truth, which is
the only defense you need.

40:30.795 --> 40:31.961
I know.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.463
They agreed to wait
on decryption

40:33.464 --> 40:35.964
before taking any action.

40:36.066 --> 40:37.834
Why don't you go home and relax?

40:37.835 --> 40:40.335
This insanity's almost over.

40:41.305 --> 40:44.468
Next time we're in Rome,
Trattoria de Nardi.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.877
I'd like that.

41:28.452 --> 41:29.619
Hey!

41:29.620 --> 41:31.888
- Hey!
- All right!

41:31.889 --> 41:34.585
Hey.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.126
- How was your trip?
- It was great.

41:37.127 --> 41:39.229
How did your thing with Kobe go?

41:39.230 --> 41:41.824
Kobe was so purposely
ignoring me, don't you think?

41:41.899 --> 41:44.000
I'm not gonna be part
of your delusion.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.526
Kobe so loves me!
He loves me!

41:58.682 --> 42:01.182
I love this song.

42:19.770 --> 42:20.904
I just remembered

42:20.905 --> 42:22.906
I have a phone call to make
to Hong Kong.

42:22.907 --> 42:24.574
It's gonna take me awhile.

42:24.575 --> 42:27.075
We were going to The Pantry.
We'll wait for you.

42:27.177 --> 42:28.978
No, no.
You guys go on ahead.

42:28.979 --> 42:30.313
I'll catch up with you.

42:30.314 --> 42:33.249
But you got to come,
because she's driving me nuts.

42:33.317 --> 42:34.651
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

42:34.652 --> 42:37.152
Okay.

42:57.007 --> 42:58.174
Vaughn.

42:58.175 --> 43:00.143
Sydney, listen.

43:00.144 --> 43:02.942
Pursuant to national security
directive 81 A,

43:03.013 --> 43:05.048
you are now in the custody
of the federal government.

43:05.049 --> 43:07.417
What the hell is going on?

43:07.418 --> 43:09.285
I promise
we'll figure this out.

43:09.286 --> 43:11.187
What about the code key
we found? What happened?

43:11.188 --> 43:13.189
The CIA had the same key.

43:13.190 --> 43:15.625
They broke the Rambaldi code
correctly.

43:15.626 --> 43:16.759
What?

43:16.760 --> 43:19.195
Those medical tests you took,
they were looking to match

43:19.196 --> 43:22.188
three specific physical
anomalies Rambaldi mentioned.

43:22.266 --> 43:26.600
DNA sequencing, platelet levels,
and the size of your heart.

43:26.704 --> 43:29.204
You match all three.

43:30.307 --> 43:32.807
What does the prophecy say?

43:36.547 --> 43:40.711
"This woman here depicted
will possess unseen marks,

43:40.784 --> 43:43.651
signs that she will be the one
to bring forth my works.

43:43.721 --> 43:47.487
Bind them with fury.

43:47.558 --> 43:50.288
A burning anger,
unless prevented.

43:50.361 --> 43:54.559
At vulgar cost, this woman
will render the greatest power

43:54.632 --> 43:57.132
unto utter desolation. "
