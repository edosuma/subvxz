00:13.279 --> 00:14.337
Oh!

00:14.380 --> 00:17.349
Hey, Betty.
Could you grab me my loofa?

00:20.520 --> 00:23.011
- What is that?
- I got it for Halston.

00:23.056 --> 00:26.890
He's supposed to come any time
I ring it, but he's kind of a bad doggie.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.760
Not like you, Betty. You're a good girl!

00:29.796 --> 00:31.764
No, no. Don't do that.

00:31.798 --> 00:35.063
Look, Amanda, I'm really glad
that you're getting so comfortable

00:35.135 --> 00:37.660
living here these past couple weeks,
really, I am.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.571
But I think it's time you and I
have a talk about something

00:40.607 --> 00:42.507
that really has been bothering me.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.602
Is this about that $60 that you left out

00:44.646 --> 00:46.739
for anyone to take
in your bottom drawer?

00:46.781 --> 00:48.339
It's time to let that go, Betty.

00:48.383 --> 00:53.377
Amanda, you have this tendency
to treat me like I'm your assistant.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.389
What? Give me an example.

00:55.423 --> 00:59.189
Well, for instance,
you rang a bell to summon me.

00:59.227 --> 01:02.958
You're constantly asking me to take
your calls, write down your messages...

01:02.997 --> 01:05.465
That reminds me,
what time is my massage tomorrow?

01:05.500 --> 01:07.628
6:30. Amanda! No!

01:07.703 --> 01:10.729
Look, I am an assistant
all day long at work.

01:10.806 --> 01:13.502
I don't want to come home
and be an assistant here, too.

01:13.575 --> 01:14.735
But you like your job.

01:14.810 --> 01:17.506
Yes, I do.
It is a wonderful stepping stone.

01:17.546 --> 01:20.140
However, I don't think
doing menial tasks for you

01:20.182 --> 01:22.446
is going to help me
get ahead in my career.

01:22.484 --> 01:26.045
Hey, Betty, is it possible you're taking
your career frustration out on me?

01:26.088 --> 01:28.716
I don't think of you as an assistant.
I really don't.

01:28.791 --> 01:32.159
I think of you as a roommate
and, sometimes, a maid.

01:35.331 --> 01:36.855
Could you grab me a coffee
while you're up?

01:36.900 --> 01:38.026
That's not my job.

01:38.068 --> 01:40.263
Morning, Betty.
Could I get a cup of coffee?

01:40.303 --> 01:42.237
Sure! That's my job.

01:44.674 --> 01:46.073
Oh, Betty.

01:46.376 --> 01:49.140
Nick Pepper. What are you doing here?

01:49.345 --> 01:51.336
You know, just visiting the old haunts.

01:51.414 --> 01:54.315
<i>Bet you've all been wondering what
I've been doing since I left Mode.</i>

01:54.350 --> 01:56.649
<i>- You left Mode?
- Yeah, like, two months ago.</i>

01:56.687 --> 01:58.655
- When Alexis left.
- Oh, right.

01:58.689 --> 02:01.249
- We really missed you.
- Anyway, crazy story.

02:01.292 --> 02:04.227
I get one job interview,
and the next thing you know,

02:04.261 --> 02:08.823
<i>I am Deputy Culture Editor
of the New York Review. Booyah!</i>

02:08.866 --> 02:10.526
- What?
- You're an editor?

02:10.568 --> 02:13.366
- I know, can you believe it?
- No.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.770
- No.
- Isn't life funny?

02:16.340 --> 02:18.467
No, but seriously, how are you guys?
Things going good?

02:18.542 --> 02:21.273
Yeah, Marc got engaged,
but then he got dumped.

02:21.313 --> 02:22.302
- Sad.
- Mandy!

02:23.482 --> 02:26.246
Hold that thought, you guys.
My assistant is texting me.

02:26.284 --> 02:28.275
- You have your own assistant?
- Oh, yeah.

02:28.320 --> 02:33.121
Hey, Nick, just out of curiosity,
how did you manage to get that job?

02:33.158 --> 02:35.922
I mean, you weren't an assistant here
for very long,

02:35.961 --> 02:38.794
and no offense, but you weren't really
that good at your job either.

02:38.830 --> 02:41.890
Yeah, but I also graduated from YETI
last year.

02:41.933 --> 02:44.333
- YETI?
- Young Editors' Training Initiative.

02:44.369 --> 02:46.463
Started a couple of years ago.
Uber-selective.

02:46.506 --> 02:49.202
Nearly everyone from my class
has gone on to become an editor.

02:49.275 --> 02:52.369
So what, there's like this
magical school where assistants go

02:52.445 --> 02:54.276
to get turned into editors overnight?

02:54.313 --> 02:58.249
One doesn't become a ninja overnight,
Betty. The hard part is getting in.

02:58.284 --> 02:59.649
You need a sponsor.

02:59.752 --> 03:02.585
You got to present a whole magazine
concept to a bunch of judges.

03:02.622 --> 03:07.423
But once you get in, if you get in, boom!

03:07.460 --> 03:10.919
I got my brass ring
and I am running with it, baby.

03:11.565 --> 03:15.331
Talk to me!
Nick Pepper, Deputy Culture Editor.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.230
Oh, Daniel, great news.

03:21.275 --> 03:25.837
You get to be my sponsor for YETI,
the Young Editors' Training Initiative!

03:26.246 --> 03:27.907
Great. What does a sponsor do?

03:27.981 --> 03:29.881
Just write a letter about how great I am.

03:29.917 --> 03:32.181
Try and keep it under a page,
if you can.

03:32.219 --> 03:34.484
Thanks, Daniel.
This means so much to me.

03:34.522 --> 03:35.682
Okay.

03:41.996 --> 03:43.623
Gross, look who's here.

03:43.665 --> 03:45.860
Wilhelmina, good morning!

03:45.934 --> 03:48.994
- Look who's here!
- How are you?

03:49.037 --> 03:50.629
Very well, thank you.

03:50.672 --> 03:56.042
And look at you, with your hair all up
and everything. Aren't you coltish?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.577
Molly was just dropping me off.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.514
I've got to run. We're doing a big
Thanksgiving thing at school today.

04:00.549 --> 04:04.747
I have a Native American from
the Poospatuck tribe coming to speak.

04:04.854 --> 04:05.912
Mmm.

04:05.955 --> 04:09.891
The life you lead.
Well, it's always good to see you.

04:09.925 --> 04:11.358
Likewise.

04:11.393 --> 04:13.588
- We'll have to do brunch!
- Really?

04:13.762 --> 04:16.094
I'd rather gouge my eyes out!

04:16.130 --> 04:18.861
I will shoot you in the heart
before I'll let you brunch with her.

04:18.901 --> 04:22.302
Why her?
I mean, she's a mousy schoolteacher,

04:22.338 --> 04:27.572
and he is ambitious, he's shrewd,
he's competitive, he's hot, he's...

04:28.945 --> 04:31.607
- He's me.
- He's the Male-a-mina.

04:31.681 --> 04:34.013
Why can't he see
we'd make the perfect couple together?

04:34.050 --> 04:36.245
Maybe you need to spend more time
with him, you know, one on one.

04:36.286 --> 04:39.119
Well, I do have
that advertiser's meeting in Florida.

04:39.155 --> 04:42.613
Maybe I could invite him.
He could see me in action.

04:42.659 --> 04:45.219
Maybe he could see you
in your underwear, as well.

04:45.262 --> 04:49.165
Marc, it's not about the sex.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.967
I can see a future with him.

04:52.003 --> 04:54.836
And he could, too, with me,
if he'd just get to know me.

04:54.872 --> 04:56.396
He'd see that we're the same.

04:56.440 --> 05:00.069
Okay, but if that doesn't work,
you could always... Woo-woo!

05:00.111 --> 05:02.238
Because you still got it, lady.

05:02.313 --> 05:06.079
Well, it's always good to have a plan B.

05:06.117 --> 05:08.085
Or a plan 34C.

05:08.119 --> 05:09.814
Ha-ha!

05:41.921 --> 05:44.890
Here at YETI, we see people
as more than just assistants.

05:44.924 --> 05:48.223
We see you as the future leaders
of the publishing industry.

05:48.261 --> 05:52.391
Wow. Gosh, I feel like I'm dreaming.

05:52.765 --> 05:56.166
This is exactly the opportunity
that I've been looking for.

05:56.202 --> 05:59.660
So here are your guidelines
for your presentation.

05:59.706 --> 06:01.834
You have to create a cover,
a table of contents,

06:01.875 --> 06:04.673
and a Letter From the Editor
for an original magazine concept

06:04.712 --> 06:06.111
that best describes you.

06:06.146 --> 06:09.411
Oh, this application is for next year.
I'm looking for this year.

06:09.750 --> 06:12.617
The deadline for this year
is just too tight.

06:12.653 --> 06:13.950
Oh.

06:13.988 --> 06:17.947
Well, I can't wait another year.
This is my future.

06:18.025 --> 06:19.754
I need to start my future, Pilar!

06:19.793 --> 06:21.818
My boss works under deadlines
all the time.

06:21.862 --> 06:26.425
- I've done it before. I can do it!
- I hope you're right. You are adorable.

06:27.135 --> 06:28.534
Thank you.

06:29.704 --> 06:33.470
And so how tight is my deadline?
Like a month? A couple weeks?

06:33.675 --> 06:35.370
You have 48 hours.

06:36.711 --> 06:39.179
- To create a magazine?
- Good luck.

07:02.972 --> 07:06.738
<i>Dad, please, you made the pozole,
you don't have to clean up, too.</i>

07:06.776 --> 07:08.767
<i>Mi hija, you just stay right there
and keep working!</i>

07:08.811 --> 07:10.676
We want you to get into this YETI.

07:10.713 --> 07:13.341
I don't know how they expect you to
come up with a magazine in two days.

07:13.382 --> 07:15.374
Well, luckily, I know exactly

07:15.452 --> 07:17.511
what a fashion magazine
is supposed to look like.

07:17.587 --> 07:19.646
You're doing a fashion magazine?

07:19.723 --> 07:22.419
What? What? Stop looking at me! Dad!

07:22.459 --> 07:25.292
Sweetheart, I thought the assignment
was to do a magazine

07:25.328 --> 07:29.355
- that expresses who you are.
- It is. It is.

07:29.399 --> 07:32.163
And I have a million ideas
that I want to do,

07:32.202 --> 07:35.763
but they're all too big and I don't
have time. So I'm being practical.

07:35.806 --> 07:38.673
<i>I have the resources at Mode
to do a fashion magazine.</i>

07:38.708 --> 07:41.177
- It just has to get me in.
- I guess that makes sense.

07:41.212 --> 07:44.579
You get your foot in the door and
then you're on your way to doing your

07:44.615 --> 07:46.913
not-fashion magazine.

07:46.951 --> 07:49.044
Okay. Mom, we have to go.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.520
<i>Randy's coming over to watch
Little Shop of Horrors.</i>

07:51.556 --> 07:52.989
The high school's doing
the play tomorrow

07:53.024 --> 07:55.458
and Randy thinks that he can see
the play without seeing the movie.

07:55.493 --> 07:57.290
I know, crazy, right?

07:57.328 --> 08:00.058
Okay, please throw out the garbage,
and we'll meet you downstairs.

08:00.098 --> 08:01.429
Betty needs to
get back to work. You, too.

08:01.466 --> 08:03.593
- Yes.
- All right, God!

08:04.369 --> 08:07.338
Hey, so, Justin's spending a lot of time
with Randy, huh?

08:07.372 --> 08:10.705
Yeah, it's been great!
You know, they hang out all the time.

08:10.742 --> 08:12.972
You know, ever since Santos died,

08:13.011 --> 08:16.037
Justin really hasn't had
any male presence in his life.

08:16.081 --> 08:18.072
Hello? I'm right here.

08:18.117 --> 08:21.280
You know what I mean. Bye. Love you.

08:21.353 --> 08:22.513
Love you.

08:22.588 --> 08:25.056
Betty, you're getting in. I know it.

08:28.661 --> 08:30.492
I hope you're right.

08:31.064 --> 08:35.193
<i>Papi, this could be the fast track
to everything I ever wanted.</i>

08:40.140 --> 08:41.607
Fashion.

08:50.150 --> 08:51.981
- Connor, hi!
- Hi.

08:52.018 --> 08:54.817
Listen, are you familiar
with Doral Resort Wear?

08:54.889 --> 08:57.722
As in the largest resort wear label
in the country.

08:57.758 --> 08:59.692
That's the one.
Well, they are interested

08:59.760 --> 09:03.059
in exclusive back cover ad spots
through 2012.

09:03.097 --> 09:05.622
- That's huge!
- Well, we just have to persuade them

09:05.666 --> 09:09.102
<i>to jump ship from Elle,
and they can only meet tomorrow.</i>

09:09.136 --> 09:11.798
So, will you join me for the meeting?

09:11.839 --> 09:14.069
I'm supposed to speak
at Molly's school in the morning.

09:14.108 --> 09:17.670
- Can we schedule it for the afternoon?
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.

09:17.712 --> 09:21.273
Doral's corporate offices
are in Key Largo, Florida.

09:21.316 --> 09:24.547
So you and I are going on a little trip.

09:30.525 --> 09:35.258
Right. Okay, Betty, which one of these
vests do you want for your cover?

09:35.297 --> 09:37.527
I like the spotted one.

09:37.566 --> 09:40.729
- Really?
- Well, I don't know.

09:40.769 --> 09:42.931
The blue one?
Or, I mean, does it even need a vest?

09:42.972 --> 09:45.202
Maybe a blazer? Or a bolero?

09:45.241 --> 09:47.300
Whoa, Betty,
now you're just saying words at me.

09:47.343 --> 09:50.744
I just... I can't wrap my head around
this Letter From the Editor.

09:50.780 --> 09:53.214
Betty, how hard can it be?
Daniel does it.

09:53.249 --> 09:56.309
- What do I do?
- What don't you do?

09:56.352 --> 09:59.651
Thank you.
Christina, can you sign this out?

09:59.755 --> 10:04.658
I'm not really feeling the red tie today.
What is all this?

10:05.461 --> 10:07.430
We're working on my magazine
for YETI.

10:07.497 --> 10:10.261
So, you're doing a fashion magazine?

10:11.201 --> 10:15.262
- Mmm-hmm. Why?
- Great, yeah, so. Carry on.

10:18.542 --> 10:20.032
Christina, am I on the wrong track?

10:20.077 --> 10:24.104
No. No, no, no, no. Right now,
come on, concentrate, missy.

10:24.147 --> 10:27.275
Which of these vests
do you want for the cover?

10:33.424 --> 10:36.621
- That one?
- Yes, that's my girl! All right.

10:37.629 --> 10:38.687
It's easy.

10:42.066 --> 10:44.534
- So, what do you think so far?
- I like it!

10:44.602 --> 10:47.628
You know, the guy who plays the
dentist is really good for high school.

10:47.672 --> 10:49.936
You're as good as him.
You can totally play that part.

10:49.974 --> 10:51.805
- You think so?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.808
Randy?

10:53.845 --> 10:55.370
- Hey, man, what's up?
- What's up, man?

10:55.414 --> 10:57.279
- What are you doing here?
- I'm just watching the show.

10:57.316 --> 10:59.546
- The one about the singing plant?
- Yeah.

10:59.585 --> 11:01.644
That's pretty lame, dude.
Skip the rest. Let's hang out.

11:01.687 --> 11:04.451
<i>Are you insane? They haven't
even done Suddenly Seymour yet.</i>

11:04.490 --> 11:06.481
Wait, you guys
are watching the show together?

11:06.525 --> 11:08.459
Mmm-hmm.

11:09.528 --> 11:13.089
- Okay, man. Well, have fun.
- See you.

11:13.165 --> 11:16.623
Well, some people enjoy a musical,
thank you very much!

11:17.803 --> 11:20.102
Come on, let's go back inside.

11:24.177 --> 11:28.170
Okay, Betty. This is it.
I think we've got it, the winning look.

11:30.283 --> 11:33.514
- Christina, it's great.
- Yes!

11:33.553 --> 11:36.078
I think my cover is going to be amazing.

11:36.122 --> 11:38.022
God, that took a really long time.

11:38.058 --> 11:40.891
I guess choosing this stuff
doesn't really come natural to anybody.

11:40.927 --> 11:43.088
Okay, write this down.

11:43.163 --> 11:48.295
I need the Elie Tahari,
this dusty rose Dior,

11:48.536 --> 11:50.197
whatever this fabulous thing is,

11:50.237 --> 11:52.535
and you know what
would be gorge with this?

11:52.573 --> 11:55.872
Those amethyst drop earrings
by Pippa Small.

11:56.310 --> 11:59.279
- We're signing all this out. Thank you.
- Yeah. For what?

11:59.313 --> 12:01.304
Marc's YETI presentation.

12:01.415 --> 12:04.543
What? Marc, wait! Marc!

12:04.585 --> 12:06.780
You're applying to YETI?
I didn't know that.

12:06.821 --> 12:09.256
Well, you know me,
I like to keep a low profile.

12:09.291 --> 12:11.521
- I'm applying to YETI, too.
- Really?

12:12.594 --> 12:14.323
You're my competition?

12:14.363 --> 12:16.923
What's your magazine?
What's your vision?

12:16.998 --> 12:18.590
Betty's doing a fashion magazine.

12:20.736 --> 12:24.172
Really? Oh, my God, brilliant!
I'm as good as in.

12:24.206 --> 12:25.935
Betty, you know
fashion means clothing, right?

12:26.007 --> 12:28.100
Betty's magazine is going to
kick your magazine's arse.

12:28.143 --> 12:30.873
<i>Really, what's it called,
Clashing Patterns Digest?</i>

12:30.912 --> 12:34.644
Okay, okay, all right.
No need to be so snarky.

12:34.684 --> 12:36.174
We could both get in.

12:36.219 --> 12:38.244
Actually, that's where you're wrong,
Betty.

12:38.287 --> 12:41.450
YETI never takes two people
from the same magazine.

12:41.491 --> 12:43.015
- Really?
- Yep.

12:43.426 --> 12:47.123
So, when it's this against this
in the fashion world,

12:47.163 --> 12:50.257
I think you know who the winner is.
Good luck.

13:01.245 --> 13:04.408
- Hi.
- There's my baby boy!

13:05.149 --> 13:09.643
- I thought we talked about that.
- Oh, right. There's my big strong man.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.720
How was the play?

13:12.756 --> 13:17.420
<i>You know, you'd think I'd be tired of
seeing Little Shop after, like, 14 times,</i>

13:17.461 --> 13:20.521
- but you'd be wrong.
- And how about Randy?

13:20.564 --> 13:25.332
Um, he liked it, I think.
He had to go home right after.

13:26.404 --> 13:30.932
Do you think Randy would like to go
with you to a Broadway show?

13:33.244 --> 13:37.078
<i>In the Heights? Winner of the 2008
Tony for Best Musical?</i>

13:37.115 --> 13:39.515
Third row orchestra?
Mom, I'm going blind!

13:39.551 --> 13:42.418
All right, all right! Don't go blind.
Just have fun.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.354
Randy's going to flip!

13:44.722 --> 13:46.155
- Thank you.
- All right. I love you.

13:46.191 --> 13:47.489
Love you!

13:49.195 --> 13:51.060
Justin, slow down!

13:51.664 --> 13:54.132
<i>Mi hija, what a surprise!</i>

13:54.266 --> 13:57.861
<i>Papi, I need a pan of your capirotada
and a spoon. Two spoons.</i>

13:57.937 --> 14:02.704
- I need one going at all times.
- Uh-oh. Two spoons, never a good sign.

14:02.741 --> 14:05.869
- Did you finish your presentation?
- No, I quit.

14:05.911 --> 14:09.369
- I can't do a fashion magazine.
Told you so!

14:09.415 --> 14:10.848
Not helping!

14:10.883 --> 14:15.014
And now I have to wait another year
to apply to YETI.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.785
I was just kidding myself. It wasn't me.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.121
Sweetheart, that's the problem.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.720
Wasn't the assignment to do
a magazine that shows who you are?

14:22.762 --> 14:24.923
- Yeah.
- Well, do that.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.399
- Dad, there isn't any time.
- Of course there is.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.232
When you are passionate,
you can do anything.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.203
Remember when your mother
was in the hospital the first time?

14:32.239 --> 14:35.106
You wanted her to know everything
you guys were doing.

14:35.141 --> 14:40.136
So you made a magazine for her.
Remember?

14:41.716 --> 14:44.150
<i>You saved The Betty Review?</i>

14:44.418 --> 14:46.249
I save everything you girls do.

14:46.287 --> 14:51.350
Look at this, articles, pictures of all
the things that are important to you.

14:51.392 --> 14:54.555
Look at my hair. I look so good.

14:54.729 --> 14:57.994
And as I remember, you were able
to make this whole magazine

14:58.032 --> 15:01.196
in one afternoon,
because it mattered to you.

15:01.236 --> 15:02.498
Oh.

15:02.804 --> 15:05.170
So, why don't you just give them this?

15:05.207 --> 15:07.198
This? You're not helping.

15:07.743 --> 15:11.509
No, wait. That does help!
That does help. Hilda, thank you.

15:11.547 --> 15:13.879
<i>Papi, thank you.
Okay, I'm going back to work now.</i>

15:13.916 --> 15:16.009
- Work? There's nobody at work.
- Doesn't matter.

15:16.051 --> 15:18.281
<i>- What about the capirotada?
- I'll eat it later!</i>

15:40.043 --> 15:42.807
Morning, Daniel! Got your phone sheet,
your schedule and your coffee!

15:42.845 --> 15:44.938
I might of had a few cups myself!

15:44.981 --> 15:47.449
Is that the same outfit
you were wearing yesterday?

15:47.483 --> 15:48.575
Good eye, good eye! Yeah.

15:48.618 --> 15:50.951
I stayed up all night
working on my YETI application,

15:50.988 --> 15:54.219
but I finished and I was wondering
if you could maybe take a look at it,

15:54.258 --> 15:56.123
you know, like a dry run sort of thing.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.958
It would mean a lot to me,
because your opinion matters.

15:58.996 --> 16:01.055
Sure, but I haven't even sat down yet.

16:01.098 --> 16:03.828
Right, right, right, right, right! Well,
you know, settle in, take your time,

16:03.867 --> 16:06.358
but just not too much time,
because my presentation's at 2:00.

16:06.403 --> 16:07.665
Man, I had a lot of coffee.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.367
- Are you okay?
- Borderline. On the edge.

16:10.441 --> 16:12.432
The good side of the edge,
so don't you worry about me.

16:12.509 --> 16:15.035
Hey, did you finish
my letter of recommendation?

16:15.113 --> 16:17.047
No, not just yet.

16:17.115 --> 16:19.948
- You forgot?
- No, I didn't forget, it's just...

16:21.086 --> 16:22.519
You know, if you're anxious about it,

16:22.554 --> 16:25.717
maybe you should write the letter,
and that way, I could sign it.

16:25.757 --> 16:28.487
You can write whatever you want.
Make yourself sound great.

16:28.526 --> 16:32.292
- Daniel, have you got a second?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks, Betty.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.061
So Wilhelmina and I
are about to head off to Florida.

16:38.104 --> 16:40.038
Right, the Doral account.
Good luck with that.

16:40.072 --> 16:42.734
- You'll definitely need it.
- Thanks, yeah.

16:42.808 --> 16:45.709
Anyway, I'm in a world of trouble
with Molly.

16:45.745 --> 16:49.272
I promised her I'd talk to her class today
about the magazine business.

16:49.348 --> 16:52.112
Now, feel free to say no to this but...

16:52.184 --> 16:54.982
You want me
to talk to Molly's class?

16:55.021 --> 16:57.581
I know she'd really appreciate it,
and I know you think she's great.

16:57.623 --> 16:59.420
- No, I don't.
- What?

16:59.458 --> 17:03.725
No, I like her.
I don't like her like you like her.

17:03.764 --> 17:06.460
- I'd love to talk to her class.
- Great.

17:06.733 --> 17:10.532
All right, I'll get you the details.
Thanks for going for me, mate.

17:10.569 --> 17:11.695
Yeah.

17:13.006 --> 17:16.339
Daniel, are you going out of the office?

17:16.910 --> 17:19.845
When do you think we could do
the dry run of my presentation?

17:19.880 --> 17:23.583
I'm not going to be gone long,
an hour, tops.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.949
You got something in your hair.

17:26.252 --> 17:28.722
Oh. I was looking for that.

17:31.159 --> 17:34.526
If I get called out there,
and I don't make it back,

17:36.064 --> 17:40.091
I want you to know you have been
an excellent teammate, Sherman.

17:40.401 --> 17:45.498
Red Rover, Red Rover,
send Daniel right over!

17:45.540 --> 17:47.269
Oh, no! Oh, no!

17:51.480 --> 17:53.380
Okay, okay, everyone!

17:53.415 --> 17:58.648
Everyone, quietly, quietly get in line
for potty break and juice.

17:58.687 --> 18:01.281
Go with Miss Haskell. Quietly in line.

18:04.493 --> 18:06.825
Great call with the Red Rover.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.863
Yeah, I knew I was in trouble
when I asked them

18:09.898 --> 18:11.923
who wanted to be an editor
when they grow up,

18:11.967 --> 18:17.463
and little Emmy said, "I want to be
a dancer, monkey, Chinese person. "

18:19.609 --> 18:21.372
So, you're good with kids.

18:21.411 --> 18:24.972
Yeah, well, it's definitely something
I've been thinking about lately,

18:25.048 --> 18:27.175
you know, starting a family.

18:30.053 --> 18:32.283
- Oh, come on. What?
- No, nothing.

18:32.322 --> 18:36.588
You are just not the Daniel Meade
that you read about in the tabloids.

18:36.626 --> 18:39.060
- Well, I'm just full of surprises.
- Hmm.

18:43.067 --> 18:47.265
So, what's next?
Finger painting? Macaroni art?

18:47.304 --> 18:50.171
Hey,
if you've got the time, I've got the pasta.

18:56.947 --> 18:59.177
I guess that's that.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.904
I've been an assistant
to the Editor-in-Chief

19:26.945 --> 19:31.212
<i>at Mode magazine for two years now,
and I love my job there.</i>

19:31.651 --> 19:34.381
But as we all know,
the goal of a fashion magazine

19:34.453 --> 19:38.048
is to create and sell an image
that women will want to become.

19:38.090 --> 19:42.652
I've imagined a magazine that
celebrates what women already are.

19:47.300 --> 19:51.031
A magazine for the young woman
looking to be inspired

19:51.070 --> 19:54.802
- beyond celebrities and clothing.
- Sounds like my daughter.

19:54.842 --> 20:00.940
<i>Well, then, your daughter might be
interested in reading B Magazine,</i>

20:00.981 --> 20:03.609
a lifestyle magazine for young women.

20:03.684 --> 20:08.917
This magazine says that it's okay
to get involved, to use your mind,

20:10.157 --> 20:13.285
be thoughtful, be confident,

20:14.194 --> 20:16.628
<i>be yourself. B Magazine.</i>

20:20.501 --> 20:24.232
Nice, Ms. Suarez.
Let's hear your Letter From the Editor.

20:34.382 --> 20:37.351
Okay, okay, okay. So, how did it go?

20:37.385 --> 20:38.716
- I think I nailed it.
Yay!

20:38.753 --> 20:40.721
- She nailed it! Yes! My daughter.
- Guys!

20:40.788 --> 20:42.449
She's my daughter!
This is my daughter.

20:42.523 --> 20:45.220
- Dad! Dad.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

21:08.084 --> 21:09.711
Andre, Heather, Emily, Sven,

21:09.786 --> 21:12.619
would you mind setting up the
PowerPoint screen in there, please?

21:12.656 --> 21:15.216
Thank you so much. You're the best.

21:16.259 --> 21:19.194
Marc. You brought a team.

21:19.663 --> 21:21.858
<i>Just some of the interns from Mode</i>

21:21.898 --> 21:24.093
helping out with the heavy lifting.
No big whoop.

21:24.134 --> 21:25.465
<i>A List magazine.</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:28.595
For all things fashion, fabulous
and famous.

21:28.638 --> 21:32.166
See that? All fluff.
You showed them you were smart.

21:32.209 --> 21:36.839
A celebrity magazine?
Hasn't that been done?

21:37.081 --> 21:41.450
Well, instead of just exploiting the
celebrity culture, I'm commenting on it,

21:41.485 --> 21:45.888
ruminating on America's obsession
with fame. Why can't we get enough?

21:46.457 --> 21:48.288
- That sounds kind of smart.
- I know.

21:48.326 --> 21:51.818
Actually, David Sedaris wrote
a really great feature for us about...

21:51.896 --> 21:56.391
Well, you know what? Why don't you
just take a look? You can keep that.

21:56.868 --> 21:59.928
Wait, you did an entire magazine?

22:00.205 --> 22:02.264
- Marc.
- Sorry we're late.

22:02.307 --> 22:03.774
There they are!

22:03.809 --> 22:07.768
Suarezes, you're familiar with
the super-chic, iconic stylings

22:07.813 --> 22:09.610
of fashion-house Badgley Mischka.

22:09.648 --> 22:12.446
Meet Mark Badgley
and James Mischka.

22:12.484 --> 22:14.452
Marc's YETI sponsors.

22:14.686 --> 22:17.985
We read your magazine.
It's so sharp. It's right on the money.

22:18.056 --> 22:20.217
Where has Wilhelmina
been hiding you?

22:20.292 --> 22:22.261
Oh, Mark, James.

22:22.295 --> 22:24.786
- Marc St. James?
- Yes?

22:24.864 --> 22:25.990
Francesca!

22:26.032 --> 22:28.398
- James!
- My gosh!

22:29.502 --> 22:30.901
I didn't know you were a judge for this.

22:30.937 --> 22:32.165
You're going to
love our friend Marc.

22:32.205 --> 22:33.229
- Thank you. Yes.
- Come in.

22:33.272 --> 22:34.466
We're eager to see your presentation.

22:34.507 --> 22:35.872
Thank you.

22:58.766 --> 22:59.733
Ahem.

23:01.101 --> 23:03.001
There's my favorite girl.

23:04.171 --> 23:06.605
Hey, are you applying to YETI again?

23:06.640 --> 23:08.267
I don't know.

23:08.409 --> 23:12.073
Daniel,
I've applied for 49 years in a row.

23:12.113 --> 23:15.674
Maybe if you finally gave me
that letter of recommendation...

23:15.717 --> 23:18.242
Come on, Betty. Don't be such a nag.

23:19.020 --> 23:21.818
Hey, would you mind
grabbing me a cup of coffee?

23:21.890 --> 23:23.380
That's my job.

23:30.231 --> 23:32.825
Don't run now.
Wouldn't want you to hurt yourself,

23:33.968 --> 23:37.735
because you're going to be
my assistant until your dying day.

23:37.773 --> 23:39.138
You're my Betty!

23:39.175 --> 23:40.233
Betty.

23:41.343 --> 23:42.401
Sorry I'm late. I lost track of time.

23:42.445 --> 23:45.312
I'm ready to help you
with your YETI thing.

23:49.852 --> 23:51.410
Oh. Excuse me.

23:54.190 --> 23:56.454
Betty, why are you texting me?

24:03.266 --> 24:06.133
All capitals.
One, two, three exclamation points.

24:06.169 --> 24:09.468
Okay, I get it, you're mad at me.
Look, I feel terrible.

24:09.506 --> 24:13.306
Is there something I can do?
Someone I can talk to for you?

24:14.444 --> 24:17.174
"Too late. " Happy face?

24:17.214 --> 24:18.681
That's supposed to be
an unhappy face!

24:18.715 --> 24:21.513
Ha! I got you to talk! You can't go back
now! I'm shutting my phone off.

24:21.551 --> 24:24.851
Listen to me. Betty, I am sorry.

24:25.556 --> 24:27.251
Whatever, Daniel.

24:27.859 --> 24:31.260
Recommendation letter, dry run,
none of it would've helped.

24:31.329 --> 24:32.921
I'm not getting into YETI.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.431
Daniel Meade's office.
How can I help you?

24:39.470 --> 24:42.962
Yes, this is Betty. What?

24:45.109 --> 24:50.013
Wait, I got in? I got into YETI?
That's amazing!

24:50.048 --> 24:51.948
Yes! All right!

24:53.185 --> 24:56.518
That's so great!
Should I come down there?

25:04.863 --> 25:06.831
You were brilliant.

25:06.865 --> 25:10.733
You got that guy to lock in the
premium rate for the next five years

25:10.769 --> 25:12.965
and make him think that it was his idea!

25:13.006 --> 25:14.337
I thought I was pushing it.

25:14.374 --> 25:17.036
Well, sometimes people want
to be pushed a little.

25:19.379 --> 25:20.676
You were magnificent.

25:20.713 --> 25:23.739
Well, we certainly do make for
a well-oiled machine.

25:23.783 --> 25:27.150
Yes, we do.
So, shall we go out and celebrate?

25:27.420 --> 25:29.479
Yes, absolutely.

25:29.522 --> 25:31.615
Although, the restaurant
we passed on the way in

25:31.658 --> 25:35.526
had a sign in front that says,
"We've got crabs. "

25:36.864 --> 25:38.195
Okay, what do you suggest?

25:38.265 --> 25:41.928
Well, believe it or not,
this hotel is the best place in town.

25:42.002 --> 25:45.631
Maybe we could order room service?
A bottle of wine?

25:45.673 --> 25:49.541
- Sounds great.
- Yes. It does.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.644
Doesn't it?

26:02.357 --> 26:06.293
Okay, so you are never going to guess
where we are going tomorrow night.

26:06.328 --> 26:08.523
<i>In the Heights! On Broadway!</i>

26:11.900 --> 26:17.429
Okay, you're speechless. I was, too!
But hello! Four Tonys! Two tickets!

26:18.073 --> 26:20.701
Um, I can't go. I'm busy.

26:20.742 --> 26:22.607
Well, you're going to have to cancel
whatever you're doing,

26:22.644 --> 26:25.044
because you don't even understand
how great these seats are.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.447
- Look, Justin, I don't...
- What?

26:28.851 --> 26:31.684
I don't think we should
hang out anymore.

26:32.421 --> 26:34.719
Why? Is there something wrong?

26:37.560 --> 26:41.656
Dude, stop following me around!
It's pathetic. Get a life!

26:44.000 --> 26:47.868
See you in dance class.

26:56.647 --> 26:59.275
- Hi, Marc.
- Marc isn't in right now,

26:59.316 --> 27:01.944
but if you leave your name and
number, he'll never speak to you again,

27:01.985 --> 27:04.954
you odious sea cow Betty. Beep.

27:05.822 --> 27:09.758
Okay, obviously
you got your YETI news.

27:10.494 --> 27:14.488
Look, I know you must be disappointed,
but for whatever it's worth,

27:14.532 --> 27:18.662
I really liked your presentation.
It was really good.

27:19.637 --> 27:21.502
Only about 1,000 times better
than yours.

27:21.539 --> 27:24.201
Okay, well, I don't know about that.

27:24.242 --> 27:27.439
Look, maybe the judges just saw
how much I wanted it, you know?

27:27.478 --> 27:29.412
How much I want to be an editor.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.415
Mmm-hmm, you're right.
Because I don't want to be an editor.

27:31.449 --> 27:35.783
I didn't go to FIT, or spend a summer
abroad studying menswear in Milan,

27:35.820 --> 27:39.279
or spend the last four years
of my life slaving

27:39.325 --> 27:41.850
for the best creative director
in the industry,

27:41.894 --> 27:46.160
who doesn't even know and wouldn't
even care that I applied to YETI.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.056
Oh.

27:48.967 --> 27:51.936
Okay, well, clearly you wanted it.

27:52.004 --> 27:55.064
Look, maybe they just
liked my concept better.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.700
Or, you know,
who knows why they would pick me. I...

27:59.178 --> 28:00.941
- Yeah, okay.
- What?

28:01.046 --> 28:03.675
- Nothing. Forget it.
- No, what, Marc?

28:04.918 --> 28:06.476
You really think that
what you did in two days

28:06.519 --> 28:10.285
is better than what I spent three months
working on?

28:11.257 --> 28:13.657
You...
You're really going to make me say it?

28:13.693 --> 28:14.990
Say what?

28:16.529 --> 28:19.896
You helped them meet their quota.

28:21.501 --> 28:23.162
What are you talking about?

28:23.236 --> 28:26.865
I mean, they picked you, Betty Suarez,
of Queens,

28:27.807 --> 28:29.036
because you're Latina.

28:31.379 --> 28:33.108
You're the token ethnic girl.

28:36.684 --> 28:39.346
What? They picked me...

28:41.088 --> 28:42.988
That doesn't even...

28:44.425 --> 28:49.624
Wow, Marc, you have said a lot
of really ugly things to me in the past,

28:49.663 --> 28:53.760
but that is by far and away the ugliest.

28:54.136 --> 28:57.799
Well, I'm sorry, Betty.
It may be ugly, but it's the truth.

29:09.785 --> 29:10.911
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

29:10.952 --> 29:12.214
You're in the YETI!

29:12.254 --> 29:15.587
<i>Felicidades a Betty, she got into YE TI</i>

29:15.624 --> 29:17.320
<i>Felicidades a Betty</i>

29:17.360 --> 29:20.921
Guys, guys, guys, guys! No, no, no.
It's not really a good time right now.

29:20.963 --> 29:22.555
<i>But I brought the capirotada!</i>

29:24.834 --> 29:29.294
- Betty is in the YETI!
- Yay, Betty! She did it! God!

29:29.338 --> 29:33.707
Guys, I don't feel like celebrating
right now.

29:33.776 --> 29:36.074
<i>Why? What's wrong, mi hija?</i>

29:37.713 --> 29:41.149
Marc told me that the only reason
YETI accepted me

29:41.217 --> 29:42.981
is because I'm Latina.

29:43.287 --> 29:46.323
- What? Sounds like sour grapes to me.
- Yeah.

29:46.323 --> 29:49.520
Yeah, well, I called,
and they didn't exactly deny it.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.586
- Who cares why you got in? You got in!
- I care!

29:52.629 --> 29:56.429
Look, you got to take
every advantage you get in this life.

29:56.467 --> 30:00.198
When I have to go to the butcher shop,
I put on my tightest tank top,

30:00.237 --> 30:02.432
and thank you to the Pointer Sisters
right here,

30:02.473 --> 30:05.306
Abundio the meat man, he puts me
in the front of the line. Is that fair?

30:05.375 --> 30:07.310
- No. So what? Who cares? I don't care.
- Thank you.

30:07.345 --> 30:09.279
I can never show my face
in that butcher shop again.

30:09.314 --> 30:11.782
- Please.
- Betty, it doesn't matter.

30:11.816 --> 30:14.546
When your mom and I came to this
country, we wanted to start a better life.

30:15.119 --> 30:17.019
Here goes the young immigrant story.

30:17.055 --> 30:20.388
All over the city, I looked for work
as a chef, but nobody would hire me.

30:20.425 --> 30:23.121
One guy told me flat out,
"Puerto Ricans don't touch the food.

30:23.161 --> 30:27.222
"You can wash the dishes. " I said,
"I'm not Puerto Rican. I'm Mexican. "

30:27.265 --> 30:29.927
You know what he said to me?
"Even worse. "

30:30.001 --> 30:32.368
<i>- Papi, look, I...
- All I'm saying is,</i>

30:32.404 --> 30:37.103
if being Mexican helped this time,
then good, take it.

30:37.843 --> 30:42.610
<i>No, papi, I wanted to be accepted
because I earned it.</i>

30:43.115 --> 30:44.377
You did.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.149
- So, Wil.
- Yes?

30:54.193 --> 30:58.187
Tell me, no man in your life?
Or are men just disposable to you?

30:58.431 --> 31:01.093
Well, yes, there's been men, but...

31:01.668 --> 31:02.794
What?

31:03.069 --> 31:09.099
Well, it sounds awful, but they've all
been such terrible disappointments.

31:11.344 --> 31:16.372
Well, I've seen you in action,
and you are a very formidable woman.

31:16.449 --> 31:18.508
I'm sure they find it hard to keep up.

31:19.787 --> 31:24.383
So, Molly,
she teaches children how to color?

31:24.625 --> 31:29.528
Yeah, she's great, Molly.
She's very free-spirited, very forthright.

31:29.564 --> 31:31.623
You always know exactly
what she's thinking.

31:31.666 --> 31:35.659
Yes, yes, yes, I met her. She's a peach.

31:35.703 --> 31:39.469
But a schoolteacher
doesn't seem like a natural fit

31:39.507 --> 31:42.601
for a powerful business mind
as yourself.

31:42.677 --> 31:46.136
Well, I guess at first

31:47.015 --> 31:50.712
it was the differences
that were challenging and exciting.

31:51.386 --> 31:54.878
It was an aphrodisiac,
opposites being drawn together.

31:56.525 --> 31:58.254
And now?

32:01.263 --> 32:04.926
And now we're engaged.

32:09.405 --> 32:12.374
Let's have some more wine, shall we?

32:23.052 --> 32:25.885
- Justin! Easy on the door!
- Leave me alone.

32:25.922 --> 32:28.220
Excuse me! Lose the attitude,

32:28.257 --> 32:29.849
<i>or you're not going to
In the Heights tomorrow.</i>

32:29.892 --> 32:32.554
- I'm not going, anyway!
- Justin! What happened?

32:32.595 --> 32:33.790
Why are you so upset?

32:33.831 --> 32:35.799
Randy doesn't want to be
friends anymore.

32:35.833 --> 32:38.734
- Why not?
- I don't know, Mom. I don't know!

32:39.336 --> 32:41.463
But I'm not going to the stupid show!

32:41.505 --> 32:44.565
- Justin, I'm sure that Randy did not...
- Mom!

32:45.376 --> 32:48.573
Please stop. I don't want to talk about it.

33:22.248 --> 33:25.046
<i>Hello?
- Oh, hey! It's Daniel.</i>

33:26.752 --> 33:32.054
Just got your thank you notes.
Just calling to thank you for those.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.758
You're thanking me
for thank you notes?

33:34.794 --> 33:39.629
It's kind of weird. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bother you.

33:39.665 --> 33:42.532
You're not bothering me.
It's nice talking to a grown-up.

33:42.568 --> 33:45.833
Connor's still in Florida,
so I'm working late tonight.

33:45.871 --> 33:50.172
By the way, the macaroni earrings
you made are surprisingly wearable.

33:55.115 --> 33:58.016
Why is it that I'm stonkered
and you're fine?

33:58.085 --> 34:00.610
Well, I guess I can hold my liquor
better than you.

34:02.489 --> 34:03.751
Yeah.

34:10.464 --> 34:13.059
You know, Wil,
I disagree with everybody at the office.

34:13.101 --> 34:15.001
- I think you're great.
- Ah.

34:16.404 --> 34:21.103
That reminds me of boarding school.
We used to play spin the bottle.

34:23.377 --> 34:27.370
- That sounds like a dangerous game.
- Well, no, it's harmless.

34:27.415 --> 34:31.545
Of course,
I never wanted the bottle to land on me.

34:31.619 --> 34:36.489
I was always afraid
of just what might happen.

34:38.960 --> 34:44.126
- You are very hard to resist.
- Well, then, stop resisting.

34:46.135 --> 34:50.833
No. Stop. Wilhelmina, I'm engaged.

34:51.206 --> 34:54.539
You need to stop what you're doing
and accept that.

35:15.098 --> 35:16.725
Here. You're in.

35:17.267 --> 35:19.758
- What?
- You were right.

35:19.803 --> 35:23.569
Your presentation was better.
So I dropped out, and you're in.

35:24.675 --> 35:29.339
Betty, are you crazy? I have been
discriminated against my whole life.

35:29.380 --> 35:32.178
If I was given an advantage like you,
I would take it and run with it.

35:32.216 --> 35:34.548
Marc, you're a gay man
in the fashion industry.

35:34.585 --> 35:36.382
You have plenty of advantages.

35:36.453 --> 35:37.977
That gets me nothing.

35:38.055 --> 35:41.752
- Madonna, tickets, backstage passes.
- Thanks, bitch!

35:43.761 --> 35:46.559
Okay, but outside the fashion world,
it's a different story.

35:46.597 --> 35:49.965
Look, Marc, at the end of the day,
you deserved it more,

35:50.001 --> 35:53.198
and I can just apply next year.

35:53.638 --> 35:56.539
Marc, just please,
before I change my mind!

35:59.077 --> 36:00.374
Okay.

36:03.315 --> 36:05.112
I'm sorry for the things
that I said yesterday.

36:05.150 --> 36:07.584
I hope you don't think I'm a racist.

36:07.619 --> 36:12.113
Just so you know, some of the hottest
guys I've ever dated have been Latino.

36:14.627 --> 36:16.151
You're welcome.

36:19.298 --> 36:20.663
Thank you.

36:36.415 --> 36:40.785
You know, you might feel better
if you just tell me what happened.

36:40.821 --> 36:42.311
I don't know.

36:52.966 --> 36:54.627
I'm on your side.

36:55.369 --> 37:00.864
Well, one minute Randy's
my best friend, and now he hates me.

37:01.541 --> 37:03.908
- That's not possible.
- No, it is.

37:05.113 --> 37:08.344
Because I don't fit in with his friends.

37:11.386 --> 37:14.514
Well, then that's their problem,
because you're perfect.

37:14.555 --> 37:15.954
Yeah, okay.

37:16.090 --> 37:19.150
No. Sweetie, listen to me.

37:20.395 --> 37:22.795
You are perfect.

37:23.364 --> 37:26.698
But you're going to meet
a lot of stupid people in your life,

37:26.735 --> 37:30.193
and they're just not going to get you.
Screw them.

37:32.374 --> 37:38.108
All that matters is that you never
for a second change who you are.

37:40.082 --> 37:41.310
I know.

37:43.852 --> 37:46.412
- Promise?
- Yeah.

37:50.659 --> 37:51.752
Okay.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.061
- Mom?
- Yeah?

37:57.534 --> 37:59.559
Did you get rid
of the theater tickets yet?

37:59.636 --> 38:00.625
No.

38:02.038 --> 38:03.198
Do you want to go?

38:03.239 --> 38:05.764
I mean, just because Randy's an idiot

38:05.809 --> 38:09.210
doesn't mean we have to waste
perfectly good tickets.

38:09.813 --> 38:12.577
<i>Yeah, man,
I would love to see In the Heights!</i>

38:12.615 --> 38:15.140
Are you kidding me? My baby boy.

38:17.688 --> 38:20.987
Sorry, sorry, I know you don't like that.

38:21.225 --> 38:23.887
It's okay. You know, I love you, Mom.

38:25.563 --> 38:27.224
I love you, baby.

38:39.377 --> 38:41.346
So, how was the trip with Connor?

38:41.380 --> 38:42.745
Was there nudity? Did you get a look

38:42.781 --> 38:43.839
down under?

38:43.882 --> 38:45.816
It was a complete bust.

38:45.851 --> 38:49.947
For some reason,
he's completely devoted to that Molly.

38:49.988 --> 38:51.080
Ugh.

38:51.123 --> 38:55.253
Devotion. Does he see
that she doesn't use eyeliner?

38:55.293 --> 38:56.954
So what's the plan,
what do we do now?

38:57.029 --> 38:59.088
Nothing. There is no plan.

39:01.533 --> 39:03.660
I'm not going to beg.

39:03.702 --> 39:07.969
If he wants to marry that
do-gooding gremlin, that's his choice.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.673
- I'm sorry, Willie.
- Sorry for what?

39:18.184 --> 39:21.210
Oh, and Marc? I heard you
got into the YETI program.

39:21.254 --> 39:24.883
I trust that's not going to interfere
with your job here.

39:28.361 --> 39:30.227
- Of course not.
- Good.

39:31.165 --> 39:36.034
I can't think of anyone more deserving.
Congratulations.

39:56.224 --> 40:02.163
Betty, I know how important
YETI was to you,

40:02.997 --> 40:04.931
- and I dropped the ball.
- It's fine.

40:04.966 --> 40:06.024
No, it's not.

40:06.101 --> 40:09.070
And now I'm hearing you dropped out
so Marc could get in.

40:09.137 --> 40:11.833
YETI won't take two people
from the same magazine.

40:11.873 --> 40:13.738
Yeah, that's why I made a couple calls.

40:13.775 --> 40:15.868
I just thought, you know,
they should know

40:15.910 --> 40:20.177
<i>you worked at Player this year, too.
Just don't drop out this time.</i>

40:22.451 --> 40:24.817
Did you get me accepted?

40:24.854 --> 40:28.224
<i>All you had to do was say
I worked at Player?</i>

40:28.224 --> 40:31.557
Yeah, now you and Marc
are from different magazines.

40:33.562 --> 40:35.496
I'm sure this didn't hurt, either.

40:38.334 --> 40:41.792
I'm sorry it took me so long to write
your recommendation.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.839
Daniel, this is six pages!

40:47.177 --> 40:50.408
That's shortened.
You should've seen the first draft.

40:52.549 --> 40:57.282
Well, I don't even know what to say.

40:57.320 --> 41:00.346
I'm sorry about before...

41:00.457 --> 41:04.518
Look, I know you're going places.
You just got to do me a favor.

41:04.995 --> 41:07.294
Try not to get there too fast.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.931
I'd be lying if I didn't say
I wish you were my assistant

41:12.003 --> 41:14.164
for the next 20 years.

41:14.238 --> 41:19.369
But don't worry, I know in 20 years,
I'll probably be your assistant.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.273
Thank you.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.966
Daniel told me we both got in.
Pretty cool, right?

41:48.040 --> 41:50.008
Did you see the schedule of speakers?

41:50.042 --> 41:52.374
Anna Wintour and Tina Brown
in the same week!

41:54.580 --> 41:58.847
This is just the first step, you know.
We're going to be huge.

41:59.252 --> 42:00.378
Betty, phone!

42:00.486 --> 42:02.579
Marc, where is
my moisturizer?

42:02.622 --> 42:04.180
Coming, Willie!

42:07.994 --> 42:11.430
