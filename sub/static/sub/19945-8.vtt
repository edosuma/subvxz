00:46.171 --> 00:48.674
Grace, Grace, we're in<i> Flapper!</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:51.301
Look at--
We're the top story on their website!

00:51.385 --> 00:52.761
Look at the headline!

00:52.844 --> 00:55.097
"They've Fallen
But They Can Still Get Off."

00:56.098 --> 00:59.768
Oh, God. Why did you have to tell her
we were on the floor all day?

00:59.851 --> 01:03.105
Because I took my back pill
and it makes me delightful and chatty.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.857
-You know this, Grace.
-Ooh! Scroll down!

01:05.941 --> 01:09.194
"After a few test-drives
with their new vibrator

01:09.278 --> 01:11.905
designed for those of us of a certain age,

01:11.989 --> 01:16.285
I'm happy to report I cannot wait
to get older."

01:16.368 --> 01:19.371
This is incredible!
We have to build on this momentum.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.956
Look at our website.

01:21.039 --> 01:26.128
If this is so good for our business,
why do we have only 18 visitors?

01:26.211 --> 01:29.381
-And I'm 12 of them.
-Just be patient.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.884
The article was just posted.
We know what a tough sell this is.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.636
I know all about tough sells.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.264
That's why my car kite never took off.

01:38.015 --> 01:41.059
Is that a kite you fly out of your car?

01:41.143 --> 01:43.645
Patent pending. Don't try to steal it.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.865
I've been wanting to do that
since we remodeled.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.992
Thank you.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.744
Thank you.

02:01.330 --> 02:05.584
There's that "happy to satisfy
and I'll be on my way" thing that I love.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.502
Can we do the thing that I love?

02:08.128 --> 02:09.046
Sure.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.135
You're free to go.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.516
Yeah, I think you're a little short.

02:24.269 --> 02:28.649
I'm so sorry, there was a kid who was
selling candy bars for his basketball team

02:28.732 --> 02:32.402
and I wadded up a 20
and threw it at him.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.199
-Do you want a giant Kit Kat?
-Yes.

02:37.783 --> 02:38.867
And the $20.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.285
Okay.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.497
There's an ATM machine downstairs.
I will come down with you.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.123
You can get me next time.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.375
How's Wednesday?

02:46.458 --> 02:49.294
I can't Wednesday.
I have a standing appointment.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.171
Oh.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.173
Cool.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.302
And so do you put us all
in your phone under code names?

02:57.386 --> 02:59.513
Am I "Blondie"?

02:59.638 --> 03:00.806
No.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.726
You're "Brianna Three."

03:08.188 --> 03:09.231
See ya.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.654
Robert, I'm going!

03:17.280 --> 03:19.783
Can you pick up a rotisserie chicken
on the way home?

03:20.700 --> 03:24.121
That's... quite a look.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.997
It's dance rehearsal day.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.500
They told us we need
to get used to the shoes.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.293
So do I.

03:47.811 --> 03:51.857
Hey! That looked sort of right!

03:51.940 --> 03:54.401
Thank you. Thank you very much.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.862
This is a rehearsal
I wish I didn't have to miss.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.197
You wouldn't have to
if you weren't so hell-bent

03:59.281 --> 04:00.782
on working the rest of your life.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.702
Only three days a week...
for the rest of my life.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.706
Well, I'm just saying, you too could be
wearing buckle shoes on a Tuesday morning.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.167
May I remind you I didn't get cast.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.835
And Bud needs our help.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.962
We can't dump the whole firm in his lap

04:14.045 --> 04:18.717
then leave him stranded so we can
both go off and "piddle and twiddle."

04:18.800 --> 04:20.719
I'm not just "piddling and twiddling,"

04:20.802 --> 04:25.348
I am also fighting for the 13 colonies
to declare independence, but no biggie.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.894
Well, I'm trying to hold off a civil war
between the Clarksons.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.395
Mine is more important.

04:30.479 --> 04:34.232
Robert, yours involves
singing and dancing.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.568
Obviously, it's more important.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.236
Thank you.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.413
Hello there, Moms.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.749
Hey! What are you doing here?

04:50.832 --> 04:52.751
I saw the article.

04:52.834 --> 04:56.213
Grace, we've got a hit!
It's just Bud, but it counts.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.507
-You read it?
-Yeah, I read it.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.926
Coyote read it.
Brianna and Mallory read it, too.

05:01.009 --> 05:01.968
Pretty impressive, huh?

05:02.052 --> 05:04.888
Wasn't that a fun way to have
our company drop into the world?

05:04.971 --> 05:07.224
Yeah, it's fun. Fun, fun, fun.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.768
Uh, it made a big impression
on all of us. Uh...

05:09.851 --> 05:13.230
In fact, we got you both a gift.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.649
Oh, you shouldn't have.

05:15.732 --> 05:19.820
Say hello to your new best friends.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.155
Panic Alerts.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.492
I have enough best friends.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.203
This seems like a joke,
but I don't get it.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.789
You were stuck on the floor
for an entire day.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.834
Honestly, I didn't have such a bad time.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.753
You couldn't even reach a phone.
We're all very concerned.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.839
Bud, you know how much I love gifts,

05:39.923 --> 05:42.676
but keep the drama
for your adult Quidditch league.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.512
No one in this house
is wearing a Panic Alert.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.681
It's not even aesthetically pleasing.

05:47.764 --> 05:51.518
Although, to be honest,
I do have an outfit it could go with.

05:51.601 --> 05:55.105
Hey, this isn't your mother's Panic Alert.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.899
These babies have GPS.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.651
I mean, you can collapse anywhere!

05:59.734 --> 06:02.862
It doesn't have to be the kitchen anymore.
You could be in the woods,

06:02.946 --> 06:06.491
getting attacked by a bear,
and the EMTs would be right there.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.742
Thank you, Bud.

06:07.826 --> 06:11.204
It's completely unnecessary
and I hate it, but thank you.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.914
How does this even work?

06:12.998 --> 06:15.750
- Wait, wait, don't hit that!
<i>- </i><i> Ms. Bergstein?</i>

06:16.501 --> 06:19.588
-Is someone living in here?
<i>-Is everything all right there?</i>

06:19.671 --> 06:22.549
It most certainly is not,
unwelcome stranger.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.385
Uh, new client. False alarm.
Thanks for checking.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.429
<i>Not a problem. Have a good day.</i>

06:28.013 --> 06:30.390
You gave her something with a button?

06:30.473 --> 06:33.893
You've been in an elevator with her,
you know she has no impulse control.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.312
Fair point. But, Mom--

06:35.395 --> 06:36.813
Agh. Nope. No sale.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.317
Imagine if you'd been alone,
and you ended up on the floor all day

06:40.400 --> 06:44.446
with no one to help you...
and something dire happens.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.157
I would never be able
to forgive myself, ever.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.825
Oh, Bud...

06:48.908 --> 06:52.245
I mean, if you don't want to do it
for you, then, please, do it for me.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.956
This house is made of stairs.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.209
You've got to go down 30 stairs
just to get to the front door.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.630
What are you looking at me for?
She does them in heels.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.966
-Hey, keep my heels out of this.
-Why do you keep wearing them?

07:05.550 --> 07:06.676
They're my trademark.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.928
That's like asking Frankie not to dress

07:09.012 --> 07:11.765
like she's going
on a granola run for her cult.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.141
You're putting yourself at more risk.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.352
Really?

07:15.852 --> 07:16.853
Mm-hmm.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.857
Fine. Fine. Maybe you're both right.

07:20.941 --> 07:25.403
Maybe this is the time to start
compromising for safety's sake.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.573
You know, vanity be damned.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.700
But I just--
I don't know what to do with them.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.036
Oh, here's something.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.086
I think she's warming up to it.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.092
Good morning, Joan-Margaret.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.301
Morning, string bean.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.387
There.

07:52.222 --> 07:57.686
Um... I think this is
your personal mail from home.

07:57.769 --> 08:01.231
Oh, for the love of Pete.
I'm sorry, wrong pile.

08:01.314 --> 08:05.360
Not that I'm conducting
personal business on company time.

08:06.903 --> 08:11.491
Oh! "Sol Days" in the office
are my favorite because of the laughs.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.034
And the work.

08:13.118 --> 08:17.247
Work? Work, work.
Now I know where Bud gets it from.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.584
I think I had to make a few less notes
and corrections this week.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.211
That's a good sign.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.632
Is he doing okay otherwise?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.759
Sol, let me tell you something.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.304
If you had told me
all those many years ago

08:33.388 --> 08:36.516
that the little boy
who stuffed my Tic Tacs up his nose

08:36.599 --> 08:39.436
was gonna become my boss someday...

08:40.603 --> 08:41.980
I would have believed you.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.899
So... So, good?

08:45.483 --> 08:46.568
So good.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.236
Okay. Bye. Thank you.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.196
Hey, Dad.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.159
Whoa.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.578
Sorry, probably shouldn't kiss the boss.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.205
Or your 32-year-old man-son.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.750
Can I get a copy of this, please?
When you get a chance.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.418
-Coming right up.
-Thank you.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.795
As soon as I freshen my Sanka.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.175
Sanka? Sanka?

09:11.009 --> 09:11.843
Sanka?

09:11.926 --> 09:14.637
-I'll have a-- I'll have a splash.
-We're good.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.524
She cracks me up.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.485
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.029
Too bad I have to let her go.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.161
Oh, there you are.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.830
I, um... I need to talk to you.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.959
Oh, I cannot believe
you're wearing that thing.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.338
Yeah, I know, but maybe Bud's right.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.049
We wouldn't have had to do
all that crawling to the phone

09:51.132 --> 09:52.884
if I had one of these.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.136
He's also right about the bears.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.639
When do you ever go into the woods?

09:57.722 --> 10:00.308
Bears are everywhere now.
There's a drought.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.436
They're coming for our water
and picnic baskets.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.106
This wonderful article comes out,
and instead of

10:06.189 --> 10:08.900
"Hey, congratulations,
let's pop out the champagne,"

10:08.983 --> 10:10.401
they give us Panic Alerts.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.028
They meant well.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.781
But when everybody sees these
around our necks,

10:14.864 --> 10:19.244
they're going to look at us and say,
"Oh, poor old lady, she lives all alone.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.287
She has medical conditions."

10:21.371 --> 10:23.081
Nobody's gonna say that.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.542
Nobody thinks of us as "poor old ladies."

10:25.625 --> 10:27.710
Oh, yeah? What about your friends?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.295
What are you talking about?

10:29.379 --> 10:30.797
Judy and Peter.

10:31.506 --> 10:35.051
They called me "Poor Grace"
at your art show.

10:35.135 --> 10:39.347
Maybe they said "pour Grace,"
like "Pour Grace another martini."

10:40.723 --> 10:41.933
Or "Whore Grace."

10:42.016 --> 10:45.937
I realize that's not a compliment,
but it's a lot better than "Poor Grace."

10:46.521 --> 10:47.647
I know what they meant.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.608
I don't want people
to look at me that way.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.153
I want them to look at me and say,

10:53.236 --> 10:56.322
"There's the lady that
created a business in her 70s."

10:56.406 --> 10:57.782
But we're doing that.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.576
Yeah, but it's not happening.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.621
Frankie, we have a great product,
but there's a lot we don't have.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.374
We don't have capital,
infrastructure, distributors--

11:06.457 --> 11:09.294
The snacks, the mascot, the theme song...

11:09.377 --> 11:11.087
I thought you were writing the theme song.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.172
It's gonna be late.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.133
I have an idea.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.759
You're not gonna like it.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.052
Oh.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.263
Okay.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.183
Out of respect for our friendship,

11:24.267 --> 11:27.770
would you let me tender my resignation
instead of just firing me?

11:29.147 --> 11:31.983
Frankie, you're an equal partner.
You can't be fired.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.360
Really?

11:34.444 --> 11:36.821
Because I was under the impression
I could fire you.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.282
Just... hear me out.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.494
I got an e-mail this morning
from an old colleague, Mimi Becker.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.830
She runs Purple Orchid.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.416
-Purple what?
-Oh, it's a big company

11:48.499 --> 11:52.712
that specializes in adult romance
and intimacy products.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.590
They have all the resources in place
that we need.

11:56.174 --> 11:59.636
So she would be just like our... partner?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.554
If she's interested, yes.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.098
I did like it being just you and me.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.392
Yeah, I know.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.644
I do, too.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.521
But this is the only way
I can think to make it work.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.277
Okay.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.613
Thanks.

12:21.783 --> 12:25.036
But only if you promise
to love me more than you love her.

12:25.662 --> 12:29.624
Tell me you love me. I love you.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.542
Tell me you love me.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.419
Tell me you love--

12:33.503 --> 12:34.504
You're fired.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.091
You cannot fire Joan-Margaret!

12:38.174 --> 12:39.384
Not fire. Ease out.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.887
She's an institution here.
You can't just put her out to pasture.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.974
Dad, she's been in the pasture for years.
She's past the pasture!

12:46.057 --> 12:48.935
I cannot believe my own son
is being so ageist.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.563
Dad, look at the cup of Sanka
Joan-Margaret just brought me.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.148
That's how she makes it.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.400
It's water.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.152
But she's been here since the beginning.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.822
Of time! The other day,
she brought me a document

13:00.905 --> 13:04.575
with those tissues she keeps under
her sleeve stapled to the first page.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.286
Those are her "Joan-Margarets."

13:06.369 --> 13:09.539
Robert and I had fun
with all of her little slips.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.540
How about this?

13:11.916 --> 13:15.128
I asked her to go down to the coffee shop
and order me a BLT for lunch.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.546
-And?
-Look.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.884
That's my BLT!

13:23.428 --> 13:25.722
You always have to order two, Bud.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.975
Really, Dad?
I have to accommodate her?

13:29.058 --> 13:30.518
I need to let her go.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.690
-I can't agree with that.
-You know I'm right.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.567
I can't agree with that, either.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.819
Dad, this is my law firm now.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.031
Don't I have the right
to hire the people that I want to hire?

13:43.114 --> 13:45.324
Who do their jobs the way I need them to?

13:45.408 --> 13:47.076
Who actually help me out?

13:48.578 --> 13:52.332
Bud, do you need anything?
I'm gonna go out to lunch now.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.125
I'm good.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.501
Okay.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.799
Oh, Mimi.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.718
Grace. Oh.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.055
Thank you so much for meeting with us.

14:07.138 --> 14:10.391
Are you kidding me?
I am so happy to see you.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.851
God, you look fabulous.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.687
Oh, thank you. So do you.

14:16.064 --> 14:19.525
Oh, this is my dear friend
and partner in Vybrant.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.819
-Frankie Bergstein.
-Yes.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.697
Oh, I loved that piece on Flapper.
You are a hoot.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.742
I know. I really am.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.453
-Well, won't you sit down?
-Thank you.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.083
Oh...

14:35.166 --> 14:37.460
I'll swing it this way.

14:38.252 --> 14:42.006
Grace... Now I gotta say
that I always knew

14:42.090 --> 14:43.966
that you would be back
in the game someday.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.927
Well, here I am.

14:46.636 --> 14:50.139
Did she ever tell you
about that conference in Denver?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.684
You mean the time we played hooky
and spent the day in the swim-up bar?

14:55.144 --> 14:56.813
I started bartending.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.526
No. Drinking straight from a bottle
of Sour Pucker is not bartending, Grace.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.152
We drove here together.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.072
What was that thing
you said to me in the car?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.116
Sit facing forward?

15:11.035 --> 15:12.370
Oh, that's so us.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.372
Well, I have a confession to make.

15:14.455 --> 15:19.085
When I read about your vibrator I thought,
"Why the hell didn't I think of that?"

15:19.168 --> 15:21.963
Especially because we're trying
to get into the older market.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.506
They're so underserved.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.426
-Oh...
-Oh, we are in complete agreement there.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.179
This feels like it was meant to be.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.058
Purple Orchid, purple dress,
purple vibrator.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.352
We're purple people.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.815
Okay, I love your product.
I mean, I love your product.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.775
Yeah, everybody who tries it does.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.652
I think it could be really right for us.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.488
But, you are targeting mature women,

15:47.572 --> 15:50.408
so the only challenge
will be the marketing.

15:50.491 --> 15:54.162
Honestly, that has been
our biggest stumbling block.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.205
Okay, my team has been working on this

15:56.289 --> 15:59.125
and I think that they might
really be onto something.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.128
So if you have time,
I would love to bring them in here

16:02.211 --> 16:04.714
-and let them pitch their ideas to you?
-Absolutely.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.840
Okay.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.012
Pitch to us.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.097
As in, we don't have to do anything?

16:13.181 --> 16:14.348
Yes.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.643
That's my favorite amount of things to do.

16:27.695 --> 16:32.325
So glad we made these sister dates
a thing, just me and you and your phone.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.451
Sorry, um,

16:33.534 --> 16:37.288
I'm letting Coyote park his tiny house
in front of ours for a while

16:37.371 --> 16:41.626
in exchange for watching
the kids sometimes. As in tonight.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.211
Are you insane?

16:44.212 --> 16:45.880
He says everything's fine.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.217
And he loves baby food.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.928
Especially the pears.

16:52.261 --> 16:56.015
How many times you think Frankie dropped
him on his head as a baby? Like, ballpark.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.101
Okay, say what you will, I think he might
be better with the kids than Mitch.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.646
Yeah. Because he's on their level.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.774
They seem him as a peer.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.906
Hey... is that your hooker?

17:15.785 --> 17:16.869
Oh, Jesus.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.830
I'm sorry, is it weird seeing
your prostitute out in public?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.249
No.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.291
Yes.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.502
I mean, he's not my prostitute.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.337
Not just mine, obviously.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.505
Should we go say "hi"?

17:27.588 --> 17:29.382
-I feel like we should go over--
-Stop.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.634
-Whatever this is. Stop.
-Do you want to leave?

17:31.717 --> 17:35.263
No. Then he might see me.
I'm just gonna get out of his eyeline.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.690
You know we don't have to do
these sister dates.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.233
Fine.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.445
Vybrant is going to get our "prime push"

17:51.529 --> 17:55.491
because of the unique and exciting
features of your vibrator.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.952
You know, everyone wants
the hot new toy, right?

17:58.035 --> 18:00.955
Well, I know we do.

18:01.038 --> 18:06.460
It's going to be a major national roll-out
in stores and then worldwide online.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.005
Major roll-out? Worldwide?

18:09.088 --> 18:12.341
Oh, my God, I am so excited.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.927
<i>Ms. Bergstein, are you okay?</i>

18:15.886 --> 18:17.221
You wore that thing?

18:17.305 --> 18:19.390
It's cool. Nobody heard.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.310
<i>Ms. Bergstein. Do you need help?</i>
<i>Ms. Bergstein?</i>

18:22.393 --> 18:26.814
I'm sorry, I'm wearing this phone thing
around my neck and it goes off sometimes.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.109
It's Japanese. You've never heard of it.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.986
Everything's fine, Myoko.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.821
So, Mimi, you were saying?

18:33.904 --> 18:38.159
Well, you know, actually I was just about
to turn it over to our marketing gurus,

18:38.242 --> 18:39.744
Evan and Katie.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.788
Since it's such a unique product,
we want to put a human face on it

18:42.872 --> 18:44.874
to make that personal connection.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.586
In fact, we want to put you two
front and center in the campaign.

18:48.669 --> 18:52.590
-Fantastic.
-Oh, my heart is soaring.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.385
So, we went ahead and borrowed
some photos from your website,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.846
and we made some mock-ups
just to give the flavor

18:58.929 --> 19:00.723
of the kind of campaign
we're talking about.

19:00.806 --> 19:05.394
Of course we'll do a proper photo shoot
with you when the time comes.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.065
This should give you a good idea
of what we're going for.

19:12.902 --> 19:16.072
I think they may have
touched you up a bit, Grace.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.158
Are you kidding? Eh...

19:20.117 --> 19:23.329
We look 12 years old in those pictures!

19:23.412 --> 19:25.373
We've got others, too.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.798
Oh, my God.

19:33.881 --> 19:38.219
Amazing, right?
I mean, it really says, "Vybrant."

19:39.512 --> 19:42.264
I thought you said
you were interested in the older market.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.599
Well, we are.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.478
It's just that we want
to reach out to women like us.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.772
Like us now.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.942
Yeah, but that's not how you sell it.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.319
Look, the research is overwhelming.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.406
Nobody wants to see older women
on a vibrator box.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.242
And nobody wants to see older women
with anything sexy.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.785
Not even older women!

20:02.868 --> 20:05.371
You and I both know this, Grace.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.082
You know, sex is... young.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.086
But we're... older.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.755
Not anymore we're not.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.508
Let me just explain to you
how this could work.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.176
-Okay.
-But Grace--

20:19.260 --> 20:21.971
Yeah, no. Let them finish, Frankie.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.641
Yeah, the most important thing is
we can get this out quickly.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.228
Now we can help you realize
every dream you have for this product.

20:29.311 --> 20:35.234
We want to make the two of you
the Ben & Jerry of vaginal stimulation.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.820
Now how does that sound, huh?

20:37.903 --> 20:38.946
Well...

20:39.488 --> 20:45.077
<i>Ms. Bergstein, if you can still hear me,</i>
<i>the ambulance should be arriving soon.</i>

20:45.161 --> 20:46.620
<i>Do not try to move.</i>

20:47.872 --> 20:49.248
Oh, God.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.792
Thank you, Myoko.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.593
-Right away, ma'am.
-Thank you.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.893
Did you lose your date?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.271
She's, uh... in the restroom.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.231
Oh, with my sister.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.821
So, how much more of a fee
is it for dinner?

21:20.905 --> 21:22.823
Because I might spring for that, too.

21:23.908 --> 21:24.950
She's not paying.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.328
Oh, does she have a coupon?

21:27.912 --> 21:29.580
No. She's my wife.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.627
Come on.

21:34.710 --> 21:39.298
I know it probably seems weird to you,
but she knows what I do.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.925
She's okay with it.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.637
She's not so thrilled with the idea

21:44.720 --> 21:47.473
of actually meeting
one of my clients, however, so...

21:47.556 --> 21:50.392
So, you do what you do with other women

21:50.476 --> 21:53.521
and then you go home
and watch<i> Scandal</i> with her?

21:53.604 --> 21:56.482
We love<i> Scandal.</i>

21:57.149 --> 21:58.901
We're really looking forward
to next season.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.825
Look... I enjoy you.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.953
But this is my job.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.998
I need something more in my life.
Something that's real.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.585
Don't you?

22:21.090 --> 22:23.092
- Perfect timing.
- Your car, sir?

22:44.863 --> 22:46.365
What happened?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.244
Things got weird.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.792
She had a hell of a run, Sol.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.545
Sometimes it's time to say goodbye.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.964
I know, I know...

23:02.047 --> 23:06.468
And, you know, retiring isn't
just about the person who's retiring.

23:06.552 --> 23:09.597
It's about giving way
to the natural order.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.100
Giving other, younger people their chance.

23:13.183 --> 23:17.187
I know your agenda, Mr. Adams.
Real subtle.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.901
She's just doing
her little "Joan-Margarets."

23:24.153 --> 23:25.613
Forgetting things...

23:27.406 --> 23:29.450
maybe a bit more than usual.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.493
Yeah, but once the memory goes...

23:31.577 --> 23:33.454
And you know, Sol,
this is not the first time

23:33.537 --> 23:36.832
that you and I have talked about it
being time for Joan-Margaret to retire.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.375
When did we talk about it?

23:38.459 --> 23:42.004
When we were on our way
to Butterfly Day at the Botanical Gardens.

23:42.087 --> 23:45.674
Oh, yeah, you're right.
That was, like, two years ago.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.384
Six years ago.

23:47.468 --> 23:48.677
No, it wasn't.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.220
Yes, it was.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.599
I remember after the butterflies,
I had a hot dog and a Fresca,

23:54.600 --> 23:58.020
which I ate while sitting
on a green bench near the lilac bushes.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.356
Okay, stop showing off.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.696
I feel terrible about this.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.698
Sol...

24:10.532 --> 24:13.786
"terrible" would be
Bud not getting the kind of support

24:13.869 --> 24:17.247
and skilled help he deserves at his firm.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.672
-You know what, you're right.
-Mm-hmm.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.424
And I should be the one
to let her go, not Bud.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.343
She was our secretary first.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.845
That's true.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.306
You want me to come with you?

24:34.390 --> 24:36.642
Though I'd rather not
because I'd probably cry.

24:36.725 --> 24:40.729
No one deserves to be fired
by someone in tiny buckle shoes.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.189
Mmm.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.003
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.218
-Hey.
-Hi.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.637
How did you do that?

25:13.721 --> 25:16.390
I can never get them all to sleep
at the same time. Never.

25:16.473 --> 25:19.018
-I played them some of my love songs.
-Ah.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.020
Those songs I wrote
that I hoped would incite passion in women

25:22.104 --> 25:24.732
all over the world?
Put them right out.

25:25.816 --> 25:28.569
I'd let you in to see them,
but if we were all in there together,

25:28.652 --> 25:30.320
we might run out of oxygen.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.035
It was mortifying!

25:37.119 --> 25:40.497
The EMTs rushed in
like it was an emergency.

25:40.581 --> 25:44.334
I can't have them doing that
every time I don't answer the Panic Alert.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.378
Mom, that's what they do.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.298
Well, I really don't like it.
And it may be my imagination,

25:49.381 --> 25:52.301
but the dispatcher strikes me
as a bit of a smart-ass.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.512
It's supposed to bring you peace of mind.
It's actually done that for me.

25:55.596 --> 25:59.224
Well, I guess your mind was so at ease
that you didn't bother to call me

25:59.308 --> 26:00.684
since you gave me this thing.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.395
<i>Maybe these just provide a nice excuse</i>

26:03.479 --> 26:06.064
for kids to not check in
with their parents as much.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.358
That is not what's happening here.

26:08.442 --> 26:11.570
I think you gave me
this contraption to keep you calm.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.782
You don't have to wear it if you
don't want to, Mom. I'll call you more.

26:14.865 --> 26:16.992
-I'll call you every day.
-Every day? Ugh.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.119
I don't want to be tied to my phone.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.412
Look, love ya.

26:28.337 --> 26:32.091
Ultimately,
there comes a point when it's time

26:32.591 --> 26:36.011
to hand it over
to the leaders of tomorrow.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.556
Sol, this must be so hard for you.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.974
It is.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.768
I get it. I do.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.228
Thank you.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.479
You're welcome.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.441
So when are you leaving?

26:49.525 --> 26:51.401
Probably around 5:00.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.531
No, I mean when are you retiring?

26:55.614 --> 26:57.282
I...

26:58.117 --> 26:59.535
I...

27:00.202 --> 27:03.038
I'm not retiring. Bud still needs me.

27:04.498 --> 27:07.125
Sol, can I show you something?

27:12.130 --> 27:15.133
These are Bud's notes on your notes.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.343
What?

27:17.719 --> 27:21.348
He goes back
and has to correct your corrections.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.810
He says you're changing
the way he wants it done

27:24.893 --> 27:28.480
and he feels like you double his workload
and slow him down.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.901
Bugger off, Dad.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.236
He said that?

27:34.319 --> 27:37.698
Well, that last bit
I may have heard only in my head.

27:39.616 --> 27:42.369
I just wanted to make sure
he was successful.

27:42.452 --> 27:46.456
Well, he's the one
who has to make sure he's successful.

27:48.208 --> 27:52.713
And truthfully, he's not the only one
waiting for you to retire.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.757
I've just been holding on for you, too.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.594
Jesus, Sol, I've got to get out of here.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.596
You've been staying for me?

28:01.346 --> 28:05.976
Well, and I might have
a lien or two against my house.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.771
But what are you waiting for?

28:10.564 --> 28:13.692
Robert wants you to retire,
I want you to retire,

28:14.359 --> 28:16.069
and Bud needs you to.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.950
How many times have I heard you
tell a client,

28:22.451 --> 28:25.996
"When it's time, it's time"?

28:29.875 --> 28:31.168
I said that a lot.

28:34.046 --> 28:39.134
In fact, I think I just said that
to you a minute ago.

28:41.887 --> 28:42.888
Sol...

28:45.807 --> 28:47.100
it's time.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.416
How'd it go?

29:13.710 --> 29:15.254
I'm Joan-Margaret.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.048
What are you talking about?

29:19.466 --> 29:21.176
It's time for me, too.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.763
I did it.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.188
I'm retired.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.027
Oh.

29:48.870 --> 29:52.165
I cannot believe
you're actually considering this.

29:52.249 --> 29:55.669
What? You heard Mimi,
this is a deal-breaker for her.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.256
And from a business standpoint,
she's right.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.758
This is how you sell things.

30:01.842 --> 30:05.429
And this is a way for us to be bigger
than we ever could have imagined.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.264
Who cares how big we are?

30:07.347 --> 30:10.684
I do. I need a success!

30:10.767 --> 30:13.186
What kind of success do you want?

30:13.270 --> 30:16.982
Do you want people to say
"Grace Hanson died rich"?

30:17.607 --> 30:21.361
Or "Grace Hanson did something
for people like us"?

30:21.445 --> 30:23.322
"Grace Hanson died rich."

30:23.405 --> 30:26.033
Don't make me come over there, young lady.

30:26.116 --> 30:27.200
I know.

30:27.284 --> 30:30.787
I know, the second one sounds better.

30:30.871 --> 30:34.207
We cannot forget who we started this for.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.335
But I look so good.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.463
-Oh, you look better now.
-Yeah, liar.

30:41.840 --> 30:46.261
Back in the day this would be
an easy "yes" for me, hands down.

30:47.179 --> 30:51.600
But now, big decisions
are becoming more about, I don't know...

30:52.809 --> 30:54.686
"Will I regret it at the end?"

30:55.187 --> 30:57.564
I like where you're going with this.

31:00.859 --> 31:04.112
We can't play a part in erasing
the very women we made this for.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.073
Bingo, baby.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.743
Goodbye, Purple Orchid.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.244
Yes!

31:11.703 --> 31:12.746
Yes, yes, yes.

31:12.829 --> 31:15.707
We'll be as successful as we can be.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.585
Just you and me
and our little old lady business.

31:23.340 --> 31:30.013
Grace, we've got 5,219 pre-orders
on our website.

31:30.847 --> 31:34.518
That is more than $200,000!

31:34.601 --> 31:35.769
Oh, my God.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.562
This means...

31:38.939 --> 31:41.316
This means we can die rich.

31:41.942 --> 31:42.859
Meet me up top.

32:33.535 --> 32:34.828
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
