OKAY CHILDREN,
IT'S FRIDAY,

00:37.393 --> 00:39.994
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
FOR P.E. CLASS.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.496
WE'RE GONNA
PLAY DODGEBALL.

00:42.498 --> 00:43.931
( all together )
UGH...

00:43.933 --> 00:46.300
WE DON'T WANT TO
PLAY DODGEBALL, IT HURTS.

00:46.302 --> 00:48.235
SO LET'S HAVE HALF
THE CHILDREN ON THIS SIDE,

00:48.237 --> 00:50.070
AND HALF THE CHILDREN
ON THAT SIDE.

00:50.072 --> 00:51.672
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT,
GENTLEMEN,

00:51.674 --> 00:53.407
I DON'T BELIEVE I KNOW HOW
TO PLAY DODGEBALL.

00:53.409 --> 00:55.276
WHAT? DON'T YOU HAVE
DODGEBALL IN FRANCE?

00:55.278 --> 00:57.144
WELL, NO, AND ACTUALLY
I'M NOT FROM FRANCE.

00:57.146 --> 00:58.312
LOOK, PIP,
THE RULES ARE SIMPLE.

00:58.314 --> 01:00.414
A KID FROM THAT TEAM TRIES
TO BEAN A KID ON OUR TEAM

01:00.416 --> 01:02.049
IN THE HEAD WITH
A BIG RED BALL.

01:02.051 --> 01:02.716
OH, DEAR.

01:02.718 --> 01:03.951
IF THE BALL HITS YOU,
YOU'RE OUT.

01:03.953 --> 01:05.185
BUT IF YOU CATCH THE BALL,
<i>HE'S</i> OUT.

01:05.187 --> 01:07.388
AND THE LAST TEAM TO STILL
HAVE ANYBODY STANDING WINS.

01:07.390 --> 01:08.689
OH, WHAT
JOLLY GOOD FUN.

01:08.691 --> 01:09.723
NO, IT ISN'T,
IT HURTS!

01:09.725 --> 01:11.592
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY LET US
PLAY THIS IN SCHOOL.

01:11.594 --> 01:14.061
( whistle )
PLAY BALL!

01:16.098 --> 01:17.631
DAMNIT,
WE LOST ONE ALREADY!

01:17.633 --> 01:19.033
YOU'RE OUT,
CLYDE.

01:19.035 --> 01:23.170
JORDAN, SWANSON,
PULL FORWARD, WE NEED BACKUP.

01:24.273 --> 01:25.739
WE'RE LOSING MEN
FAST OUT HERE.

01:25.741 --> 01:30.711
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR GAME,
BE THE BALL.

01:31.647 --> 01:32.780
I CAUGHT IT,
I CAUGHT IT!

01:32.782 --> 01:35.649
GREAT CATCH, KYLE,
NOW YOUR TEAM'S ON OFFENSE.

01:35.651 --> 01:36.850
HERE PIP,
YOU THROW.

01:36.852 --> 01:37.851
OH, NO,
I COULDN'T.

01:37.853 --> 01:38.852
C'MON,
DON'T BE A WUS.

01:38.854 --> 01:41.555
ARE YOU GONNA BE A FRENCH PANSY
YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

01:41.557 --> 01:42.222
I'M NOT FR--

01:42.224 --> 01:43.757
THROW THE BALL,
YOU STUPID FROG!

01:43.759 --> 01:45.659
MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T
EAT ALL THOSE CROISSANTS--

01:45.661 --> 01:48.062
OKAY, THAT WAS
PRETTY GOOD, PIP.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.864
BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HIT
THE KIDS ON THE OTHER TEAM.

01:50.866 --> 01:52.700
OW, MY NOSE,
YOU BROKE MY NOSE!

01:52.702 --> 01:54.702
DAMN, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

01:54.704 --> 01:56.103
OH, I'M
DREADFULLY SORRY.

01:56.105 --> 01:58.072
THAT NOSE IS BLEEDING
PRETTY BAD, KYLE.

01:58.074 --> 02:01.141
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO
TO THE NURSE'S OFFICE.

02:01.143 --> 02:02.710
( gasping )

02:02.978 --> 02:04.244
NO,
IT'LL BE OKAY.

02:04.246 --> 02:07.848
SORRY SON, YOU'LL HAVE TO LET
THE NURSE LOOK AT IT.

02:07.850 --> 02:08.982
C'MON.

02:08.984 --> 02:09.683
NO!

02:09.685 --> 02:11.952
DUDE, HE'S GOING
TO THE NURSE'S OFFICE.

02:11.954 --> 02:14.755
I HEARD THE SCHOOL NURSE
IS HIDEOUSLY DEFORMED.

02:14.757 --> 02:17.157
I HEARD SHE HAS TENTACLES
AND EATS CHILDREN FOR LUNCH.

02:17.159 --> 02:20.260
STAN, HAS ANYBODY
ACTUALLY SEEN THE NURSE

02:20.262 --> 02:22.930
AND COME BACK
TO TELL ABOUT IT?

02:22.932 --> 02:26.100
NO CARTMAN,
NOBODY EVER HAS.

02:38.948 --> 02:41.014
ARE YOU
KYLE BROSLOFSKI?

02:41.016 --> 02:41.648
YES.

02:41.650 --> 02:42.783
I'M THE
SCHOOL NURSE.

02:42.785 --> 02:44.084
DID YOU HURT
YOUR NOSE?

02:44.086 --> 02:44.718
YES.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.587
WHY DO YOU HAVE
YOUR EYES CLOSED?

02:46.589 --> 02:48.355
I'M NOT
GONNA HURT YOU.

02:48.357 --> 02:48.989
I KNOW.

02:48.991 --> 02:51.392
SO OPEN THEM.

02:52.828 --> 02:53.794
OH.

02:53.796 --> 02:54.595
WHEW.

02:54.597 --> 02:56.296
NOW WHAT SEEMS
TO BE THE PROBLEM?

02:56.298 --> 02:58.332
I JUST HIT MY NOSE
PLAYING DODGEBALL.

02:58.334 --> 03:00.534
WELL, I'LL GET YOU
AN ICE PACK.

03:00.536 --> 03:01.602
AAHH...!

03:01.604 --> 03:02.936
WHAT?

03:02.938 --> 03:03.704
AAHH...!

03:03.706 --> 03:05.672
OH, I SEE YOU'VE
NOTICED MY DISORDER.

03:05.674 --> 03:09.109
I HAVE A STILLBORN FETUS GROWTH
ATTACHED TO ME HEAD.

03:09.111 --> 03:10.844
AAHH...!

03:10.846 --> 03:14.548
AND WHEN SHE MOVED UP AND DOWN,
THE LITTLE FETUS JIGGLED.

03:14.550 --> 03:15.916
( together )
EW...!

03:15.918 --> 03:16.617
DID IT TALK?

03:16.619 --> 03:18.118
THE LITTLE FETUS,
DID IT TALK?

03:18.120 --> 03:19.453
NO, IT LOOKED DEAD.

03:19.455 --> 03:20.454
( together )
EW...!

03:20.456 --> 03:21.455
WAS IT
WEARING CLOTHES?

03:21.457 --> 03:24.391
DUDE, WHERE IS SHE GONNA
GET FETUS CLOTHES?

03:24.393 --> 03:25.859
OH, YEAH.

03:25.861 --> 03:26.460
EW.

03:26.462 --> 03:27.361
( together )
EW...!

03:27.363 --> 03:28.362
AND THEN SHE
WALKED OVER--

03:28.364 --> 03:29.296
KYLE,
THAT IS ENOUGH!

03:29.298 --> 03:31.598
I'VE BEEN READING UP ON
YOUR POOR NURSE'S CONDITION

03:31.600 --> 03:33.500
AND IT IS NOTHING
TO BE MADE FUN OF.

03:33.502 --> 03:35.602
IT'S CALLED
"CONJOINED TWIN MYSLEXIA".

03:35.604 --> 03:37.171
WHO THE HELL CARES
WHAT IT'S CALLED,

03:37.173 --> 03:38.338
AS LONG AS SHE
DOESN'T TOUCH ME.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.340
NOW THAT'S JUST
THE KIND OF UNAWARENESS

03:40.342 --> 03:41.842
THAT WE NEED TO
FIGHT AGAINST.

03:41.844 --> 03:43.544
SIT DOWN, BOYS.

03:43.546 --> 03:46.046
YOU SEE BOYS, SOMETIMES
WHEN BABIES ARE BORN

03:46.048 --> 03:47.381
THEY'RE BORN
AS TWINS.

03:47.383 --> 03:49.817
BUT SOMETIMES THE TWINS
GET HOOKED TOGETHER

03:49.819 --> 03:52.519
AND THEY'RE BORN
AS<i> SIAMESE</i> TWINS.

03:52.521 --> 03:54.154
GROSS!
GROSS!

03:54.156 --> 03:55.022
BUT SOMETIMES,

03:55.024 --> 03:56.690
AFTER THE SIAMESE TWINS
ARE JOINED TOGETHER

03:56.692 --> 03:58.559
ONE OF THE TWINS
DIES BEFORE BIRTH.

03:58.561 --> 04:01.595
THE LIVING BABY IS BORN WITH
THE DEAD BABY STILL ATTACHED.

04:01.597 --> 04:04.898
SOMETIMES THIS DEAD TWIN
IS INSIDE THE LIVING PERSON,

04:04.900 --> 04:08.135
SO EVEN<i> YOU</i> COULD HAVE
A DEAD TWIN INSIDE YOU

04:08.137 --> 04:09.803
AND NOT EVEN
KNOW IT.

04:09.805 --> 04:10.637
( screaming )

04:10.639 --> 04:13.440
SO NOW THAT YOU'RE EDUCATED
ABOUT HER DISEASE

04:13.442 --> 04:16.810
YOU WON'T NEED TO MAKE FUN
OF HER, RIGHT BUBBY?

04:16.812 --> 04:18.412
AH, YEAH.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.449
( laughing )

04:22.451 --> 04:25.752
CAN YOU IMAGINE
THAT POOR, POOR WOMAN?

04:25.754 --> 04:26.453
MM-HMM.

04:26.455 --> 04:29.857
FEELING LIKE AN OUTCAST,
BEING RIDICULED EVERY DAY.

04:29.859 --> 04:30.858
MM-HMM.

04:30.860 --> 04:31.758
( phone )

04:31.760 --> 04:32.426
HELLO.

04:32.428 --> 04:34.995
HELLO, SHEILA,
IT'S SHARON, STAN'S MOTHER.

04:34.997 --> 04:35.929
YES, HELLO,
SHARON.

04:35.931 --> 04:37.664
SHEILA, I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU MIGHT KNOW

04:37.666 --> 04:41.401
WHY MY SON IS TRYING TO SPLIT
HIS HEAD OPEN WITH AN ICE PICK.

04:41.403 --> 04:42.903
NO, I HAVE
TO GET IT OUT!

04:42.905 --> 04:45.138
WELL SHARON, I WAS TRYING
TO EDUCATE THEM

04:45.140 --> 04:47.207
ABOUT
<i>CONJOINED TWIN MYSLEXIA.</i>

04:47.209 --> 04:49.076
SO THIS<i> IS</i>
YOUR FAULT.

04:49.078 --> 04:50.143
WOULD YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?

04:50.145 --> 04:52.446
NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO SCARE
THE HELL OUT OF MY CHILD,

04:52.448 --> 04:53.780
JUST GO OUTSIDE
AND SIT IN THE ROAD

04:53.782 --> 04:55.983
UNTIL A TRUCK
RUNS YOU OVER INSTEAD.

04:55.985 --> 04:56.750
THAT DOES IT!

04:56.752 --> 05:01.388
I MUST EDUCATE THE ENTIRE TOWN
ABOUT THIS AWFUL DISEASE!

05:01.390 --> 05:03.223
MM-HMM.

05:03.392 --> 05:04.591
DUDE,
I DON'T GET IT.

05:04.593 --> 05:06.026
WHY ARE WE PLAYING
DODGEBALL AGAIN?

05:06.028 --> 05:07.961
YEAH, I THOUGHT WE ONLY
PLAY IT ON FRIDAYS.

05:07.963 --> 05:08.996
CHILDREN,
GREAT NEWS!

05:08.998 --> 05:12.799
WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO PLAY IN
THE STATE FINALS FOR DODGEBALL.

05:12.801 --> 05:14.368
DO WE HAVE TO?

05:14.370 --> 05:17.237
CAN'T WE PLAY WITH THAT BIG
PARACHUTE AGAIN OR SOMETHING?

05:17.239 --> 05:18.906
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
CHILDREN,

05:18.908 --> 05:19.873
IF WE CAN WIN STATE,

05:19.875 --> 05:22.342
WE CAN PLAY IN THE NATIONALS
IN WASHINGTON D.C.

05:22.344 --> 05:24.144
HEY, THEY HAVE
A ZOO THERE!

05:24.146 --> 05:25.412
THAT'S RIGHT,
NOW, C'MON,

05:25.414 --> 05:27.314
WE HAVE A LOT
OF PRACTICING TO DO.

05:27.316 --> 05:29.483
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE WON SOMETHING

05:29.485 --> 05:30.751
IN ORDER TO GO
TO STATE FINALS?

05:30.753 --> 05:32.653
HEY PIP, YOU WANT TO BE
ON MY TEAM AGAIN?

05:32.655 --> 05:33.487
I'D LOVE TO!

05:33.489 --> 05:36.156
TRY NOT TO SEND ANYBODY
TO THAT NURSE, FRENCHY.

05:36.158 --> 05:38.592
HEY, I GET QUITE DISTURBED
WHEN YOU CALL ME THAT!

05:38.594 --> 05:40.093
YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE FUN
OF FOREIGNERS.

05:40.095 --> 05:41.962
AND BESIDES,
I HATE FRENCH PEOPLE.

05:41.964 --> 05:43.597
( whistle )

05:44.233 --> 05:45.699
( all laughing )

05:45.701 --> 05:48.936
WELL MRS. BROSLOFSKI,
IT CERTAINLY IS A THRILL

05:48.938 --> 05:50.404
SEEING YOUR
CHEERY FACE AGAIN.

05:50.406 --> 05:52.439
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
PISSING YOU OFF TODAY?

05:52.441 --> 05:53.807
NOTHING
IS PISSING ME OFF.

05:53.809 --> 05:55.976
I JUST WANT TO
START A MOVEMENT!

05:55.978 --> 05:56.843
OF COURSE YOU DO.

05:56.845 --> 05:59.613
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ALL
ABOUT YOUR SCHOOL NURSE.

05:59.615 --> 06:03.350
NURSE GOLLUM IS ABSOLUTELY
QUALIFIED TO--

06:03.352 --> 06:05.552
NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT
UPSET ABOUT<i> HER.</i>

06:05.554 --> 06:08.021
I WANT TO MAKE
THE PUBLIC<i> AWARE</i> OF HER.

06:08.023 --> 06:09.556
HER DISEASE SHOULD BE
BROUGHT TO LIGHT

06:09.558 --> 06:12.225
SO IT COULD BE UNDERSTAND
RATHER THAN MADE FUN OF.

06:12.227 --> 06:14.528
AND WHAT DISEASE
IS THAT?

06:14.530 --> 06:15.662
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,

06:15.664 --> 06:19.666
NURSE GOLLUM HAS
CONJOINED TWIN MYSLEXIA.

06:19.668 --> 06:20.467
WHAT'S THAT?

06:20.469 --> 06:23.236
SHE HAS A DEAD FETUS
ATTACHED TO HER HEAD.

06:23.238 --> 06:24.271
SHE<i> DOES</i>?

06:24.273 --> 06:26.607
YOU NEVER
NOTICED THAT?

06:26.609 --> 06:27.874
NO, I NEVER DID.

06:27.876 --> 06:29.876
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

06:29.878 --> 06:32.446
THIS POOR WOMAN IS FORCED
TO LIVE IN THE SHADOWS

06:32.448 --> 06:34.514
BECAUSE SHE FEELS
LIKE AN OUTCAST.

06:34.516 --> 06:36.984
IT IS UP TO US TO MAKE HER
FEEL COMFORTABLE

06:36.986 --> 06:38.452
AND WELCOME
IN OUR TOWN.

06:38.454 --> 06:41.588
DID YOU SAY A FETUS STICKING
OUT FROM HER HEAD?

06:41.590 --> 06:44.358
I WANT TO INVITE YOUR NURSE
TO A DINNER PARTY

06:44.360 --> 06:45.492
AT MY HOUSE
THIS EVENING.

06:45.494 --> 06:48.528
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF BOTH YOU
AND MR. MACKY WOULD ATTEND.

06:48.530 --> 06:50.464
DO WE HAVE TO EAT
KOSHER STUFF?

06:50.466 --> 06:53.533
I'LL TALK TO NURSE GOLLUM, BUT
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE DELIGHTED.

06:53.535 --> 06:55.202
LET'S SAY
AROUND EIGHT?

06:55.204 --> 06:56.003
WONDERFUL.

06:56.005 --> 06:59.673
YOU DID SAY SHE HAS
A FETUS ON HER HEAD?

07:01.310 --> 07:02.175
OKAY CHILDREN,

07:02.177 --> 07:06.113
NOW WHO'S GONNA
WIN THE STATE FINALS?!

07:06.815 --> 07:07.547
DENVER?

07:07.549 --> 07:09.783
♪ HERE WE GO, COWS,
HERE WE GO ♪

07:09.785 --> 07:12.686
♪ HERE WE GO COWS,
HERE WE GO ♪

07:12.688 --> 07:14.221
♪ UH-UH ♪

07:16.659 --> 07:19.493
I THINK WE NEED TO
GET OFF ON THIS EXIT.

07:19.495 --> 07:20.627
SIT DOWN, KID!

07:20.629 --> 07:23.230
BUT IT'S QUICKER TO GET TO
THE DENVER SCHOOL THAT WAY.

07:23.232 --> 07:25.599
DO YOU WANT
AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!

07:25.601 --> 07:28.035
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU?

07:28.037 --> 07:29.002
I'M NOT
A STUDENT.

07:29.004 --> 07:30.904
YOU CAN'T GIVE ME
AN OFFICE REFERRAL.

07:30.906 --> 07:32.572
I SAID,
SIT DOWN!

07:32.574 --> 07:37.044
YES, MA'AM.

07:37.046 --> 07:40.280
WHOA DUDE,
THIS IS A SCHOOL?

07:40.749 --> 07:42.883
HELLO THERE,
I'M BOB THOMAS,

07:42.885 --> 07:44.551
THE COACH FOR
THE DENVER COUGARS.

07:44.553 --> 07:46.486
I'M CHEF, COACH OF
THE SOUTH PARK COWS.

07:46.488 --> 07:48.288
WELL, I CERTAINLY
WANT TO THANK YOU

07:48.290 --> 07:49.423
FOR BRINGING
YOUR TEAM DOWN.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.757
APPARENTLY NOBODY ELSE
WOULD PLAY US

07:50.759 --> 07:52.659
BECAUSE THEY KNEW
WE'D JUST BEAT THEM SILLY.

07:52.661 --> 07:53.894
SO I TOLD
THE SCHOOL BOARD

FROM THE MOUNTAINS,

07:56.198 --> 07:57.030
AND HERE YOU ARE.

07:57.032 --> 07:58.732

SOUTH PARK, YEAH?

07:58.734 --> 07:59.399

07:59.401 --> 08:01.702

08:01.704 --> 08:03.503
WELL WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET THIS OVER WITH,

08:03.505 --> 08:05.138
WE GOT TO START
THINKING ABOUT D.C.

08:05.140 --> 08:07.574
PROMISE WE WON'T
MAKE IT TOO PAINFUL.

08:07.576 --> 08:08.341
( whistle )

08:08.343 --> 08:10.877
( ref )
PLAY BALL!

08:17.753 --> 08:21.421
SO WHERE DID YOU GET
YOUR DEGREE, NURSE GOLLUM?

08:21.423 --> 08:22.723
COLORADO STATE.

08:22.725 --> 08:24.491
OH!
OH!

08:27.429 --> 08:30.063
SHEILA, COULD YOU
PASS ME THE DEAD FETUS?

08:30.065 --> 08:32.032
I MEAN, GRAVY.

08:32.034 --> 08:33.233
OW!

08:39.441 --> 08:40.540
DAMNIT, C'MON!

08:40.542 --> 08:41.808
SOMEBODY CATCH

08:41.810 --> 08:46.179
ALRIGHT, BOYS, JUST FIVE MORE
OF THE LITTLE BASTARDS TO GO!

08:47.015 --> 08:49.316
I CAUGHT IT,
I CAUGHT IT!

08:49.318 --> 08:50.383
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

08:50.385 --> 08:52.753
HE'S SO FAT,
IT STUCK IN HIS BELLY.

08:52.755 --> 08:53.787
SOUTH PARK
ON OFFENSE!

08:53.789 --> 08:56.423
GREAT JOB,
JUST STAY FOCUSED NOW.

08:56.425 --> 08:57.424
GO FOR IT, PIP.

08:57.426 --> 08:58.191
OH, FATHER.

08:58.193 --> 09:00.961
YOU FRENCHY
LITTLE FROG!

09:01.263 --> 09:04.464
WHOA,
GREAT SHOT, PIP!

09:04.833 --> 09:07.200
SO I HEAR THAT
THE SOUTH PARK COWS

09:07.202 --> 09:10.137
ARE PLAYING THE STATE FINALS
IN DODGEBALL TONIGHT.

09:10.139 --> 09:12.806
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
THOUGH.

09:12.808 --> 09:15.575
THE DENVER TEAM
ALWAYS WINS, OKAY?

09:15.577 --> 09:16.409
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

09:16.411 --> 09:19.212
I THINK OUR BOYS MIGHT HAVE
THE DEAD FETUS TO WIN.

09:19.214 --> 09:19.913
HEART!

09:19.915 --> 09:21.681
KEEP YOUR
MOUTH SHUT!

09:21.683 --> 09:23.183
IT'S OKAY,
MS. BROSLOFSKI, REALLY.

09:23.185 --> 09:26.653
PLEASE FORGIVE US,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,
NURSE GOLLUM.

09:26.655 --> 09:28.288
I'M QUITE
SECURE WITH IT.

09:28.290 --> 09:29.122
I HAVE FELT SO BAD

09:29.124 --> 09:31.491
EVER SINCE I HEARD THE BOYS
MAKING FUN OF YOU.

09:31.493 --> 09:32.526
THEY'RE JUST
YOUNG BOYS.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.127
JOKING IS A WAY FOR THEM
TO COME TO TERMS

09:34.129 --> 09:35.695
WITH WHAT THEY
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:35.697 --> 09:37.030
COULD I GET
SOME MORE PORK?

09:37.032 --> 09:39.232
SO DID YOU EVER THINK OF
HAVING IT CUT OFF?

09:39.234 --> 09:42.135
YES, PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,
THE THOUGHT HAD OCCURRED TO ME.

09:42.137 --> 09:44.171
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WOULD MEAN MY DEATH.

09:44.173 --> 09:46.072
OH, SO I SUPPOSE
THAT'S OUT.

09:46.074 --> 09:47.741
HOW ABOUT
A HAT THEN?

09:47.743 --> 09:48.408
NO REALLY--

09:48.410 --> 09:50.043
YES, WE COULD
GET YOU A FEW HATS,

09:50.045 --> 09:52.345
AND WEAR A DIFFERENT ONE
EVERY DAY.

09:52.347 --> 09:54.447
I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

09:54.449 --> 09:55.582
BUT IT'S
NOT NECESSARY.

09:55.584 --> 09:57.217
I'M A PRETTY
HAPPY PERSON.

09:57.219 --> 09:57.984
I'VE GOT IT!

09:57.986 --> 10:00.620
WE COULD SET ASIDE A WEEK
TO MAKE THE PUBLIC AWARE

10:00.622 --> 10:02.656
OF FOLKS
JUST LIKE YOU!

10:02.658 --> 10:03.356
OH, YES.

10:03.358 --> 10:05.258
A CONJOINED TWIN MYSLEXIA
AWARENESS WEEK.

10:05.260 --> 10:06.793
THAT HAS A NICE RING.

10:06.795 --> 10:07.727
BUT I DON'T THINK--

10:07.729 --> 10:09.863
THE SCHOOL CAN PUT OUT
PAMPHLETS, OKAY?

10:09.865 --> 10:12.732
WE CAN HAVE SEMINARS
TO EDUCATE, OKAY?

10:12.734 --> 10:14.134
OH, THIS IS
SO EXCITING!

10:14.136 --> 10:18.371
I'M GONNA GET THE MAYOR
ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW!

10:24.112 --> 10:26.479
YOU GOT
JUST ONE MORE, PIP.

10:26.481 --> 10:29.783
YOU GET THIS KID,
AND WE ARE STATE CHAMPIONS.

10:29.785 --> 10:30.784
YEAH,
AND IF YOU DON'T,

10:30.786 --> 10:34.588
YOU'RE A BIG DUMB-ASS
EUROPEAN HIPPY PIECE OF CRAP!

10:34.923 --> 10:36.790
GET HIM, FRENCHY.

10:37.626 --> 10:39.559
SOUTH PARK WINS!

10:39.561 --> 10:41.561
WE DID IT, CHILDREN,

10:41.563 --> 10:43.630
WE'RE GOING TO
WASHINGTON D.C.!

10:43.632 --> 10:47.100
( sobbing )
OWEE, IT HURTS.

10:51.907 --> 10:53.340
( laughing )

10:56.044 --> 10:56.877
( applause )

10:56.879 --> 11:00.080
OH, SORRY ABOUT WHIPPING
YOUR ASS THERE, COACH!

11:00.082 --> 11:04.284
♪ BABY, COME ON,
JUST WHOOPED ASS ♪

11:04.286 --> 11:07.687

11:07.689 --> 11:09.689

11:09.691 --> 11:10.690
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

11:10.692 --> 11:13.126
THIS IS INDEED A GREAT WEEK
FOR SOUTH PARK.

11:13.128 --> 11:15.595
MISS HERMANS HAS OPENED
THE EAST WING OF THE LIBRARY,

11:15.597 --> 11:19.499
AND OUR OWN SOUTH PARK COWS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DODGEBALL TEAM

11:19.501 --> 11:21.935
IS GOING TO
THE NATIONAL FINALS!

11:21.937 --> 11:24.604
WHERE THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
BE BEATEN SENSELESS

11:24.606 --> 11:25.805
BY THE
WASHINGTON TEAM.

11:25.807 --> 11:29.843
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS WEEK
HAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION

11:29.845 --> 11:33.013
A VERY SERIOUS
AND DREADED DISEASE,

11:33.015 --> 11:35.081
CONJOINED TWIN MYSLEXIA.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.850
AND SO IT IS
IN HONOR OF THIS

11:36.852 --> 11:39.019
THAT I DECLARE
THIS EXCITING WEEK

11:39.021 --> 11:41.955

12:01.443 --> 12:03.510
WHAT A GLORIOUS PARADE

12:03.512 --> 12:08.014
LET'S HEAR IT FOR
THE PARADE COORDINATORS!

12:08.116 --> 12:11.685
I REALLY SHOULD BE ACCOMPANYING
THOSE KIDS TO WASHINGTON

12:11.687 --> 12:13.253
IN CASE
THEY GET HURT.

12:13.255 --> 12:14.187
THAT<i> IS</i> MY JOB.

12:14.189 --> 12:17.157
NONSENSE, THIS IS YOUR WEEK.

12:17.159 --> 12:19.659

12:20.629 --> 12:22.662

12:22.664 --> 12:24.130
I SAID, SIT DOWN!

12:24.132 --> 12:26.599
YEAH, WHATEVER, YOU OLD,
DRIED UP FAT HOG.

12:26.601 --> 12:27.934
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

12:27.936 --> 12:31.104
I SAID I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO VISIT PRAGUE.

12:31.106 --> 12:32.172
OH, ME TOO.

12:32.174 --> 12:34.207
OKAY,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

12:34.209 --> 12:35.909
SOME<i> HAKE</i> FISH.

12:35.911 --> 12:37.777
I GOT A JELLY ROLL,

12:37.779 --> 12:39.846
SWEET,
JELLY ROLL'S PERFECT.

12:39.848 --> 12:41.314
PLACES.

12:42.884 --> 12:45.118
( kid )
WHOA!

12:47.589 --> 12:51.992
DAMN MAN, THIS IS
THE BIG TIME ALRIGHT.

12:51.994 --> 12:53.426
CHEF, WE'RE HUNGRY.

12:53.428 --> 12:54.561
YOU CAN EAT
AFTER THE GAME.

12:54.563 --> 12:56.796
YOU CHILDREN WIN THIS ONE
AND YOU'RE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS.

12:56.798 --> 12:58.898
THEN YOU CAN GO ON
AND PLAY THE CHINESE.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.868
MY MOM SAYS THERE'S A LOT OF
BLACK PEOPLE IN CHINA.

13:01.870 --> 13:02.635
WHAT?

13:02.637 --> 13:03.737
ARE YOU CHEF?

13:03.739 --> 13:04.337
YEAH.

13:04.339 --> 13:05.972
THE WASHINGTON TEAM
FORFEITED THE GAME.

13:05.974 --> 13:08.541
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU'RE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS.

13:08.543 --> 13:09.275

13:10.912 --> 13:11.878
WOW,

13:11.880 --> 13:14.147
( announcer )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
LET'S HEAR A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

13:14.149 --> 13:16.816

13:20.255 --> 13:22.389
WHY DID

13:22.391 --> 13:23.990
YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?

13:23.992 --> 13:26.426
LAST YEAR'S NATIONAL CHAMPIONS
WERE THE AUSTIN PIRATES.

13:26.428 --> 13:28.428
THEY PLAYED CHINA FOR
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP,

13:28.430 --> 13:30.463
ONLY FOUR OF THEM
CAME BACK ALIVE.

13:30.465 --> 13:33.867
CHINESE DODGEBALL PLAYERS
AREN'T LIKE US.

13:34.903 --> 13:37.670
( speaking Chinese )

13:38.340 --> 13:41.041
( kid )
THEY DO NOTHING BUT DODGEBALL,
DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

13:41.043 --> 13:43.977
THEY USE STEROIDS AND
ADVANCED TRAINING EQUIPMENT

13:43.979 --> 13:46.546
TO MAKE THEM NOT KIDS,
BUT ANIMALS.

13:47.983 --> 13:51.051
WELL GOOD LUCK, WE'VE GOT
OUR FUTURES TO THINK ABOUT.

13:51.053 --> 13:54.954
OKAY CHILDREN,
BACK IN THE BUS.

13:54.956 --> 13:57.390
AND SO,
AT THIS HONORARY DINNER,

13:57.392 --> 14:00.360
WE TAKE A LOOK BACK

IT'S TIME TO PRESENT

14:35.397 --> 14:38.231
THE LIFETIME CONJOINED TWIN
ACHIEVEMENT AWARD.

14:38.233 --> 14:41.101
THIS AWARD GOES TO
OUTSTANDING CONJOINED TWINS

14:41.103 --> 14:43.403
WHO HAVE MADE
A MARK ON SOCIETY.

14:43.405 --> 14:45.171
AND THE WINNER IS...

14:45.173 --> 14:47.040
NURSE GOLLUM.

14:47.042 --> 14:49.843
NURSE GOLLUM!

14:50.078 --> 14:50.810
OH, BOY.

14:50.812 --> 14:53.279
EXCUSE ME MAYOR,
BUT I RECEIVED SOME NEWS

14:53.281 --> 14:54.547
YOU MIGHT ALL
BE INTERESTED IN.

14:54.549 --> 14:57.750
OUR SOUTH PARK COWS
HAVE JUST BEATEN
THE WASHINGTON DODGEBALL TEAM

14:57.752 --> 15:01.754
AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO
THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN CHINA.

15:01.756 --> 15:03.990
OKAY CHILDREN,
NOW WE'RE ALMOST TO CHINA.

15:03.992 --> 15:06.960
I WANT YOU ALL TO TRY
AND FOCUS ON YOUR GAME.

15:06.962 --> 15:08.895
BUT CHEF, WE DON'T
WANT TO PLAY THE CHINESE.

15:08.897 --> 15:11.898
NONSENSE! IF WE WIN THIS,
WE'RE CHAMPIONS.

15:11.900 --> 15:12.966
BUT WE COULD
GET KILLED!

15:12.968 --> 15:14.934
AND JUST WHAT PRICE WOULD
YOU PAY FOR ETERNAL GLORY?

15:14.936 --> 15:18.705
JUST IMAGINE A BIG YELLOW
DODGEBALL CHAMPION'S BANNER

15:18.707 --> 15:21.007
HANGING IN THE CAFETERIA,
IMAGINE IT.

15:21.009 --> 15:22.041
DUDE,
CHEF HAS LOST IT.

15:22.043 --> 15:23.643
YOU'LL BE ON THE NEWS
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

15:23.645 --> 15:26.379
SOUTH PARK WILL FINALLY HAVE
A SPORT IT'S GOOD AT.

15:26.381 --> 15:28.648
OH, CHILDREN,
IT'LL BE GLORIOUS.

15:28.650 --> 15:32.452
SURE, CAPTAIN AHAB
HAS TO GET HIS WAY, HUH?

15:32.454 --> 15:34.554
DUDE,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:34.556 --> 15:35.755
I DON'T KNOW.

15:35.757 --> 15:37.290
ISN'T THAT KID
KEVIN CHINESE?

15:37.292 --> 15:38.691
YEAH,
YOU'RE FROM CHINA.

15:38.693 --> 15:41.394
NO, I'M FROM AMERICA,
MY PARENTS ARE CHINESE.

15:41.396 --> 15:43.196
TELL US HOW THE CHINESE
PLAY DODGEBALL.

15:43.198 --> 15:44.564
I HAVE
NO IDEA, DUDE.

15:44.566 --> 15:45.598
C'MON,
RICE PICKER!

15:45.600 --> 15:47.934
HEY, HEY!
CHILDREN THAT'S NOT COOL.

15:47.936 --> 15:51.704
YOU DON'T MAKE FUN OF SOMEBODY
BECAUSE OF THEIR ETHNICITY.

15:51.706 --> 15:52.472
YOU DON'T?

15:52.474 --> 15:54.240
BUT YOU JUST RIPPED
ON CHINESE PEOPLE.

15:54.242 --> 15:55.675
NO, NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

15:55.677 --> 15:58.444
I MADE FUN OF THEM
BECAUSE THEY ARE<i> FROM</i> CHINA.

15:58.446 --> 16:00.780
IT'S NOT OKAY TO
MAKE FUN OF AN AMERICAN

16:00.782 --> 16:02.882
BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK,
BROWN OR WHATEVER.

16:02.884 --> 16:05.018
BUT IT<i> IS</i> OKAY
TO MAKE FUN OF FOREIGNERS

16:05.020 --> 16:07.187
BECAUSE THEY'RE
FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY.

16:07.189 --> 16:09.022
( together )
OH!

16:09.024 --> 16:10.223
YEAH.

16:10.225 --> 16:16.296
( announcer )
IT IS WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT
WE WELCOME OUR AMERICAN FRIEND,

16:16.298 --> 16:21.634
LET THE CHAMPION OF
DODGEBALL BE DECIDE!

16:25.874 --> 16:28.374
DAMN DUDE,
CHINA IS!@#$% UP.

16:28.376 --> 16:29.242
TAKE PLACES!

16:29.244 --> 16:30.376
ALRIGHT,
LET'S GO COWS!

16:30.378 --> 16:32.078
LET'S SHOW THEM
WHAT WE GOT!

16:32.080 --> 16:32.879
OKAY, TOM,

16:32.881 --> 16:35.415
LOOKS LIKE THE YANKEES
ARE GETTING READY TO PLAY.

16:35.417 --> 16:38.985
I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY'LL HAVE
PROBLEMS<i> SEEING</i> THE BALL

16:38.987 --> 16:41.387
WITH THEIR
BIG AMERICAN EYES.

16:41.389 --> 16:42.889
( laughing )

16:42.891 --> 16:45.258
GOOD THING THEY HAVE
THOSE BIG EYES,

16:45.260 --> 16:47.327
SO THEY DON'T
HAVE TO RELY ON THAT

16:47.329 --> 16:50.063
AMAZING
AMERICAN INTELLECT.

16:50.065 --> 16:52.966
( laughing )

16:53.435 --> 16:55.835
PLAY BALL!

16:58.139 --> 17:00.006
HOLY CRAP.

17:01.710 --> 17:02.942
GOD DAMN!

17:02.944 --> 17:05.812
HEY, WHAT YOU CALL
WHITE AMERICAN PERSON

17:05.814 --> 17:08.815

20:40.862 --> 20:44.096
THANK YOU MAYOR,

SHE'S REALLY TOUCHED.

20:47.936 --> 20:49.836
WHAT I REALLY
WANT TO SAY IS,

20:49.838 --> 20:51.304
WELL,
THIS MAY SOUND ODD

20:51.306 --> 20:54.140
COMING FROM A WOMAN WITH A FETUS
STICKING OUT OF HER HEAD,

20:54.142 --> 20:58.544
BUT, YOU'RE ALL
A BUNCH OF FREAKS!

20:59.047 --> 21:01.781
UH, FREAKS WITH
BIG HEARTS!

21:01.783 --> 21:02.548

TREATED DIFFERENT.

I DON'T WANT TO BE TREATED
SPECIAL OR TREATED GINGERLY.

SHOUTED AT, AND MADE FUN OF,

21:23.037 --> 21:25.037
