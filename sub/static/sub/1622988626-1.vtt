WEBVTT

01:34.712 --> 01:37.089
Bro! Excuse me! Sorry.

01:51.186 --> 01:52.396
Left.

02:18.047 --> 02:21.300
Stop sign, left.

02:43.530 --> 02:50.537
One, two, three, four, five.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.582
On the right.

03:09.264 --> 03:10.099
Mr. Burnz?

03:11.141 --> 03:12.976
Are you Charlie Burnz?

03:13.894 --> 03:15.813
Charlie Burnz, I'm talking to you.

03:16.855 --> 03:18.899
Mr. Burnz, Charlie Burnz.

03:38.043 --> 03:41.797
Sweep up a little bit. Make sure
all the props are in the right spot.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.133
- Hey, Marge?
- Hey, Charlie.

03:44.216 --> 03:45.342
Where is everybody?

03:46.301 --> 03:49.930
Charlie, it's Monday.
They're at the writers' meeting.

03:50.014 --> 03:54.268
Oh, right. Well, I had a long weekend.

03:54.351 --> 03:56.437
All right, take it easy. All right.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.398
Better hurry.
They're pitching new sketches!

03:59.481 --> 04:01.525
Yeah, we made sure to take a lot of care

04:01.608 --> 04:04.695
and not offend anybody
with this next sketch, so please strap in

04:04.778 --> 04:06.405
and, you know, enjoy.

04:06.488 --> 04:07.406
Okay, so this is...

04:07.489 --> 04:10.075
This is an infomercial
for a brand-new comedy album.

04:10.159 --> 04:14.455
We start with shots of planets and stars,
just these beautiful shots of space.

04:14.538 --> 04:17.623
And then, we hear a VO,
and we see a chyron.

04:17.707 --> 04:20.544
In the tradition of George Carlin
and Richard Pryor,

04:20.627 --> 04:22.504
we bring you the next comedy voice.

04:22.588 --> 04:25.841
And we cut to a photograph
of Stephen Hawking.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.928
But we photoshopped him
in front of a brick wall.

04:30.012 --> 04:31.805
So he looks like he's at a comedy club.

04:31.889 --> 04:33.849
We have a microphone
where his computer is.

04:35.059 --> 04:41.398
Is it just me, but what's the deal
with black holes? Am I right?

04:44.193 --> 04:47.029
You people like impressions?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.080
So how do you think the meeting went?

04:58.040 --> 04:59.792
Some very funny ideas.

04:59.875 --> 05:04.171
But, Brad, somebody's got to talk
to Roger about his inflections.

05:04.254 --> 05:06.340
I know, I know. I think he gets nervous.

05:06.423 --> 05:07.591
No, come on.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.718
George Carlin, Richard Pryor.

05:09.802 --> 05:13.847
My God, Stephen Hawking pronounced
his name better than he does.

05:13.931 --> 05:15.474
Here's one for the news segment.

05:15.557 --> 05:18.435
Or as Roger calls it, the news "seg-ment."

05:18.519 --> 05:20.396
All right, I'll give this to the guys.

05:20.479 --> 05:22.690
By the way, there's a new invention
called computers.

05:22.773 --> 05:24.108
You may wanna get one.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.694
You know, I had one, but I like this.

05:26.777 --> 05:29.071
We started out together.
I love the feel of the paper.

05:29.154 --> 05:33.033
I like the fact that the key leaves a mark
that wasn't there a second ago.

05:33.117 --> 05:35.911
But I did treat myself to one of these.

05:36.912 --> 05:38.497
Look at you. You know how to work it?

05:38.580 --> 05:41.709
Absolutely, unless I wanna send an e-mail,
a text, or make a phone call.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.544
- Oh, that's not important.
- Not at all.

05:43.627 --> 05:46.255
- Wanna get something to eat?
- I have a lunch date.

05:46.338 --> 05:47.965
Look at you, Mr. Social.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.135
It's someone who won an auction
to have lunch with me at the charity event

05:51.218 --> 05:52.803
for inner-city libraries.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.929
Sounds like a blast.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.981
This restaurant nice. Excuse me.

06:04.481 --> 06:05.858
Oh, no.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.985
Sorry. Bye.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.446
Maybe you, sir. Hello.

06:10.529 --> 06:14.491
Oh, Phil Donahue. Nice to meet you.

06:14.575 --> 06:18.454
- The hell was that all about?
- Sir, hi.

06:18.537 --> 06:21.707
Oh, no, sorry, sorry to bother you.
Wrong person.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.459
Excuse me. Bye-bye.

06:24.126 --> 06:27.212
Excuse me. Are you, by any chance,
looking for me?

06:27.296 --> 06:28.547
I'm Charlie Burnz.

06:28.630 --> 06:30.341
- You gotta be shitting me.
- What?

06:30.424 --> 06:31.425
This was you?

06:31.508 --> 06:33.344
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.262
You took some hits along the way, huh?

06:35.346 --> 06:37.848
Yeah, you might say that,
but that's a very old picture.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.352
That was actually taken on the <i>Mayflower.</i>
I did win the shuffleboard tournament.

06:42.394 --> 06:45.689
Well, belated congratulations.
I'm Emma Payge.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.816
- Emma, pleasure, thank you. Sit down.
- Sorry I'm late.

06:47.900 --> 06:51.070
Don't worry about it. Not a problem.
Glad you're here.

06:51.153 --> 06:53.197
And thank you for bidding
on me at the auction.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.075
I'm so flattered that somebody your age
would be a fan of my work.

06:57.034 --> 06:58.827
- Truth?
- Sure.

06:58.911 --> 07:00.913
I don't know who the hell you are.

07:01.205 --> 07:02.956
My ex bid on you.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.583
- You didn't?
- Nope.

07:05.584 --> 07:06.752
How did this...?

07:06.835 --> 07:09.088
Well, he's an actor,
and he was doing a scene

07:09.171 --> 07:10.964
from one of your plays
in his acting class,

07:11.048 --> 07:12.800
and he wanted to meet you,
so he bid.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.053
- How much?
- Twenty-two.

07:16.136 --> 07:20.391
- $2200? That's fantastic.
- $2200, my ass!

07:20.474 --> 07:22.351
$22.

07:22.434 --> 07:24.853
$22 was the winning bid?

07:25.979 --> 07:29.858
It started at 20, and then it went up
in 50-cent increments.

07:29.942 --> 07:32.194
Oh, that's so sad.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.988
Hello. Welcome to Le Monde.

07:35.072 --> 07:37.199
I'll be your server.
What can I get for you?

07:37.282 --> 07:38.659
- Have you eaten here before?
- No.

07:38.742 --> 07:42.579
They have the greatest steak sandwich.
That's all I get. It's fantastic.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.707
That's perfect.
I'll have the seafood salad.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.461
- Okay. And for you, sir?
- I'm gonna have the...

07:49.545 --> 07:53.841
Oh, can I have extra clams,
extra calamari, and extra crab meat?

07:54.842 --> 07:57.428
- Of course. And for you, sir?
- I'm gonna have the...

07:57.511 --> 08:01.557
Oh, and can I have a lobster tail
right on top, with extra mussels?

08:01.640 --> 08:02.641
Lots of mussels.

08:02.725 --> 08:05.811
The ones from New Zealand, not from Jersey
because they got black hairs.

08:05.894 --> 08:08.355
Who knows what's in those?
That can be really toxic.

08:08.439 --> 08:11.984
Are you done? Because there are
a few species you haven't mentioned yet.

08:12.568 --> 08:13.569
Go ahead.

08:13.652 --> 08:16.572
- I'm gonna have the...
- Oh, can I have a Diet Coke?

08:17.656 --> 08:19.408
And for you, sir?

08:19.491 --> 08:22.619
I'm gonna have a tuna sandwich,
whole wheat toast, and an iced tea.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.164
Very good.

08:25.998 --> 08:28.375
Why would you order a tuna sandwich
when you said

08:28.459 --> 08:30.127
they had the best steak sandwiches?

08:30.210 --> 08:32.504
While you were ordering half
of the Atlantic Ocean,

08:32.588 --> 08:35.758
I developed a hankering
for the only fish left on the menu.

08:36.342 --> 08:39.177
Touché, old man. Touché.

08:39.927 --> 08:41.180
So let me ask you a question.

08:41.263 --> 08:43.640
If you don't know who I am,
how come your ex didn't come?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.934
I caught him cheating on me.

08:46.018 --> 08:49.438
And he said it was because
I'm the worst lay in the world.

08:49.521 --> 08:52.566
And trust me, he is wrong, okay?

08:52.649 --> 08:56.028
You ought to see my moves.
It's "Circus Doleil."

08:56.737 --> 08:59.448
Okay. Well, let's...
Let's get through lunch first.

09:00.074 --> 09:02.326
- I'd break your back, old man.
- Thank you.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.496
Yeah, have you laid out, dead,
with a smile on your face.

09:06.205 --> 09:10.125
And your kids will be like,
"How did he die? How did my dad die?"

09:10.209 --> 09:12.795
And I would just look at them
in their eyes and say,

09:12.878 --> 09:13.921
on top of me.

09:17.883 --> 09:19.426
That's a really lovely thought.

09:20.678 --> 09:22.971
You funny, old man.

09:23.055 --> 09:27.726
I'm glad I came, even if it was
to shove you up my ex's big fat ass.

09:27.810 --> 09:30.104
Now, there's a compliment
you don't hear every day.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.441
- Whoa, look what the tide brought in.
- Yeah.

09:34.525 --> 09:36.610
- Thank you very much.
- Please enjoy.

09:36.694 --> 09:38.570
Emma, enjoy your buffet.

09:39.113 --> 09:42.533
So... I take it you like comedy.

09:43.325 --> 09:44.284
Nope.

09:44.368 --> 09:45.703
You don't?

09:45.786 --> 09:49.456
I mean, I love to laugh, but in real life.
You know what I'm saying?

09:50.249 --> 09:53.961
Well, you know, that's what I do
in real life. I'm a comedy writer.

09:54.044 --> 09:56.505
You ever watch <i>This Just In</i>
on Sunday nights on Funny?

09:58.424 --> 10:02.720
I also write some Broadway and movies
and five books.

10:03.721 --> 10:05.723
And what do you do?

10:05.806 --> 10:09.351
Charlie, I don't feel so good.

10:09.435 --> 10:11.729
Why is your face suddenly bigger
than it was before?

10:11.812 --> 10:15.858
- I can't feel my lips.
- Oh, are you allergic to seafood?

10:15.941 --> 10:17.443
Oh, shit, maybe I am.

10:17.526 --> 10:18.610
What should I do?

10:18.694 --> 10:21.947
- Call the hospital. Call the hospital!
- What? What?

10:22.031 --> 10:23.657
Call the hospital!

10:24.533 --> 10:27.036
Dial the nearest hospital!
Dial the nearest hospital!

10:27.119 --> 10:29.038
<i>I do not know. Let me check the Web.</i>

10:29.121 --> 10:31.332
- Dial the nearest hospital!
- Is everything all right?

10:31.415 --> 10:34.084
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Okay, what did you do?

10:34.168 --> 10:35.085
I didn't do anything!

10:35.169 --> 10:36.337
These are Jersey mussels!

10:36.420 --> 10:38.630
- What?
- I knew they were Jersey mussels!

10:38.714 --> 10:41.550
- Jersey? No! I'm from Jersey.
- I need emergency. Emergency.

10:41.633 --> 10:42.634
This is an emergency.

10:45.095 --> 10:46.930
Everybody, calm down. Everybody, relax.

10:47.014 --> 10:50.642
- We should call the ambulance.
- Siri! What is wrong with you?

10:51.435 --> 10:54.021
Ma'am, have you had an allergic reaction
to seafood before?

10:54.855 --> 10:57.066
You just randomly ordered,
and this is what happened?

10:57.149 --> 11:01.403
- I had a hankering.
- Okay, just relax. We're almost there.

11:01.487 --> 11:03.197
You're gonna be okay.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.491
Charlie? Charlie.

11:05.574 --> 11:08.619
Charlie!

11:08.702 --> 11:12.414
You're all I've got, Charlie,
don't leave me!

11:29.306 --> 11:30.516
Oh, boy.

11:32.851 --> 11:34.645
Mr. Burnz?

11:36.689 --> 11:38.857
Oh, I'm not supposed
to fill these forms out.

11:38.941 --> 11:41.819
- What's your relation to Miss Payge?
- She won me in an auction.

11:43.362 --> 11:44.530
Fine, don't believe me.

11:44.613 --> 11:45.864
She doesn't have insurance,

11:45.948 --> 11:48.575
and she really shouldn't be leaving here
by herself.

11:48.659 --> 11:50.202
No insurance?

11:50.285 --> 11:51.745
Okay.

11:51.829 --> 11:53.330
$1100?

11:53.956 --> 11:56.375
Yes. And you'll get the ambulance bill
in the mail.

11:57.418 --> 11:59.211
You can pay me on the way out.

11:59.795 --> 12:02.381
- Your daughter is going to be fine.
- My d...?

12:02.464 --> 12:04.341
Great. Isn't that great?

12:04.425 --> 12:08.053
She told me all about how you adopted her
from that orphanage in Kenya.

12:08.137 --> 12:09.930
- That's very special.
- Oh, she told you?

12:10.014 --> 12:11.890
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well...

12:11.974 --> 12:14.309
Well, she is special.

12:14.393 --> 12:16.103
Well, this is a pretty severe reaction.

12:16.186 --> 12:18.313
Are there other allergies
that I should know about?

12:18.397 --> 12:20.649
Well, I think really you should talk
to her about that

12:20.733 --> 12:24.111
or I can put you in touch
with one of the elders of her tribe.

12:24.194 --> 12:26.739
You could ask for Mbolo.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.867
It's good that you reacted
as quickly as you did.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.952
A little longer
may have been a different story.

12:32.036 --> 12:34.038
Here are her prescriptions.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.998
Pharmacy is that way.

12:39.668 --> 12:41.128
$600?

12:42.838 --> 12:45.007
So far, a tuna sandwich
cost me close to two grand.

12:45.090 --> 12:47.801
- Welcome to New York, pal.
- What's this?

12:47.885 --> 12:50.471
That's epinephrine.
You need to inject her within the hour.

12:50.554 --> 12:52.056
- And if I don't?
- She'll die.

12:53.057 --> 12:54.058
Next.

12:55.893 --> 13:01.857
"Remove blue safety release
by pulling up, straight up."

13:01.940 --> 13:04.026
- Okay.
- What's taking so long?

13:04.109 --> 13:06.653
I'm having trouble reading the directions
without my glasses.

13:06.737 --> 13:09.114
And honestly,
I'm a little nervous about it.

13:09.198 --> 13:10.324
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

13:10.407 --> 13:12.743
Hell, no. Put that thing down.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.621
Ain't no way in hell I'm gonna let you
stab me with that Lego stick

13:15.704 --> 13:18.666
while your hand shaking like that.
You might put out one of my eyes.

13:18.749 --> 13:21.710
But they said I have to do it
within the hour or you'll be in trouble.

13:21.794 --> 13:24.630
Well, we'll just wait an hour.
If I'm not dead, you can go home.

13:24.713 --> 13:26.715
Fine. Enjoy your bloating.

13:29.635 --> 13:31.887
All right. Stick me, old man.

13:40.646 --> 13:41.897
Motherf...!

13:43.357 --> 13:44.775
Son of a...!

13:46.402 --> 13:47.319
Okay.

13:47.403 --> 13:49.488
Show time's over.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.742
Make me some tea, maybe it'll
help with the bloating...

13:53.826 --> 13:56.745
"Only hold in for a few seconds."

14:03.752 --> 14:05.087
"Slippery when wet?"

14:05.170 --> 14:07.297
- You looked?
- I had to. I really...

14:07.381 --> 14:10.843
I had to. That's not something you wanna
do with your eyes closed. Believe me.

14:10.926 --> 14:13.846
It could have ended up someplace
that we would not be happy about.

14:15.514 --> 14:19.727
Thank you. I promise I will pay you back
every dime that you laid out.

14:19.810 --> 14:21.937
You don't have to do that.
How are you feeling?

14:22.021 --> 14:24.440
Like you shot me up
with five six-hour energy drinks.

14:24.523 --> 14:27.776
So I've got about a good 30 hours
of energy! I'm lit!

14:29.486 --> 14:31.405
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

14:31.488 --> 14:33.323
Why did you tell the doctor
that I was your father?

14:33.407 --> 14:36.076
I thought it would be cool
to have a white dad.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.287
And the orphanage story?

14:38.370 --> 14:39.872
I was a little loopy by then.

14:39.955 --> 14:41.665
I'm sure that was the mussels talking.

14:41.749 --> 14:43.667
Yup, those mussels
were definitely talking.

14:43.751 --> 14:45.586
Yeah, must have been.

14:45.669 --> 14:48.339
Well, listen, try to get some rest.

14:48.422 --> 14:50.507
Do you need anything else?
I have 20 bucks left.

14:51.967 --> 14:53.135
I'll be fine.

14:53.218 --> 14:56.597
Look, I wanna apologize to you
for saying all that stuff about my ex.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.223
I should have never done that.

14:58.307 --> 15:01.018
You are a good man,
and that was not fair to you.

15:01.101 --> 15:04.355
- Hey, I understand. This way out?
- Yep, that way.

15:05.814 --> 15:07.232
- Perky.
- Yeah.

15:19.453 --> 15:20.579
Good try.

15:23.374 --> 15:25.876
- All right, that's...
- It's all right. It's a base hit.

15:36.011 --> 15:37.930
Sorry, Rex. That's a match.

15:40.432 --> 15:42.017
I don't know why you play against me.

15:42.101 --> 15:44.687
- It's good aerobics.
- Yeah, for me.

15:44.770 --> 15:47.856
I'm running around like crazy.
I'm gasping for air. You just...

15:47.940 --> 15:50.776
You just stand at the net.
Somehow it's six-love, six-love.

15:50.859 --> 15:52.903
- Six-love?
- Six feet...

15:52.986 --> 15:55.572
You get perverse pleasure
beating your only son like this?

15:55.656 --> 15:56.824
Yeah, a lot.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.495
Listen, Dad...

16:02.830 --> 16:06.917
Francine wants to know if you are coming
to Lindsay's bat mitzvah.

16:08.043 --> 16:11.255
My daughter wants to know if I'm coming
to my granddaughter's bat mitzvah?

16:11.338 --> 16:13.966
- Why wouldn't I?
- She says you never RSVP'd.

16:15.509 --> 16:19.263
Why didn't she just call
instead of asking you to ask me?

16:19.346 --> 16:21.140
Dad, don't be upset.
You know how she gets.

16:21.223 --> 16:22.891
It'll be a fun day. We'll be together.

16:22.975 --> 16:25.352
I don't want Lindsay to think
that I wasn't gonna come.

16:25.436 --> 16:27.646
Who knows what your sister says to her?

16:27.730 --> 16:29.648
Just give her a call.

16:31.734 --> 16:34.903
This was fun. I'll see you next week?

16:34.987 --> 16:37.573
When I lose to you, again.

16:37.656 --> 16:39.074
I gotta go.

16:39.158 --> 16:41.869
I have a 3:00. I'm a little nervous.

16:41.952 --> 16:45.748
I'm submitting my design
for a new building in Union Square.

16:45.831 --> 16:48.334
Well, it could be a big thing for me.

16:48.417 --> 16:50.794
I RSVP'd. I know I RSVP'd.

16:50.878 --> 16:54.006
Dad, don't worry about that.
And wish me luck.

16:54.715 --> 16:55.841
About what?

16:58.093 --> 17:00.012
For my building, for the design.

17:00.679 --> 17:04.892
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

17:05.893 --> 17:07.561
Yeah. I'll see you.

17:09.145 --> 17:11.106
I'm gonna call her right now.

17:11.190 --> 17:13.609
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

17:13.692 --> 17:14.902
Daddy!

17:14.985 --> 17:16.111
Daddy!

17:16.194 --> 17:19.280
I did something wrong, Daddy!

17:19.365 --> 17:22.116
I'm scared! Daddy!

17:23.160 --> 17:25.328
<i>Daddy!</i>

17:34.338 --> 17:37.883
Oh, hi. This is... Craziest thing. I...

17:37.966 --> 17:40.761
- I forgot what locker I was using.
- That's okay.

17:40.844 --> 17:41.804
I have a master.

17:42.888 --> 17:45.933
- Let's start with this row.
- Okay, good.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.584
That's perfect.

18:12.668 --> 18:15.879
You're gonna crush this.
Give me a high-five.

18:17.131 --> 18:19.925
I'm proud of you.
You're doing so beautifully.

18:20.009 --> 18:24.096
Yeah. I'm just getting a little nervous
about my speech.

18:24.179 --> 18:27.391
- Have you started writing it yet?
- Yeah.

18:30.936 --> 18:32.521
It's your grandfather.

18:34.356 --> 18:35.274
Hi, Papa Charlie.

18:35.357 --> 18:38.193
Hey, Lindsay, honey.
How's my bat mitzvah girl?

18:38.277 --> 18:39.528
Good.

18:39.611 --> 18:40.988
Ask him if he's coming.

18:41.071 --> 18:42.865
What do you mean? Grandpa's not coming?

18:42.948 --> 18:44.908
- Are you coming?
- That's why I'm calling.

18:46.618 --> 18:49.163
Of course I'm coming.
I wouldn't miss that for the world.

18:49.246 --> 18:52.583
- Great. I'm so happy.
- <i>Hey, when you're happy, I'm happy.</i>

18:52.666 --> 18:56.587
- Can I speak to your Mom?
- <i>Tell him I can't talk to him right now.</i>

18:58.339 --> 19:00.674
She said she'll call you back.

19:01.258 --> 19:03.052
Yeah. Okay.

19:03.135 --> 19:04.595
I can't wait to see you.

19:04.678 --> 19:05.929
<i>I can't wait to see you too.</i>

19:06.013 --> 19:08.932
So tell me. You got a pretty dress?

19:09.016 --> 19:10.726
You're gonna have to see when you come.

19:10.809 --> 19:13.020
<i>Okay.</i>

19:14.313 --> 19:16.690
Can you help me with my speech?

19:16.774 --> 19:19.735
Yeah, of course.
We'll punch it up real good.

19:20.903 --> 19:24.406
- Yeah.
- <i>Okay, kid. See you soon.</i>

19:25.157 --> 19:26.825
I had a bad day.

19:27.826 --> 19:31.121
Thanks for seeing me so late.
I really appreciate it.

19:31.205 --> 19:37.336
I... I couldn't remember
where my locker was in my health club.

19:37.419 --> 19:39.588
I've been going there for years.

19:40.214 --> 19:42.091
So damn embarrassing.

19:42.174 --> 19:44.009
That should be expected.

19:44.093 --> 19:47.888
Don't panic.
Are you doing what we talked about?

19:48.889 --> 19:51.600
Yeah. I tried not to vary my routine.

19:51.684 --> 19:55.062
I walk the same way to work every day.
I eat right.

19:55.854 --> 19:57.731
Getting some exercise.

19:57.815 --> 20:00.234
And I'm taking my meds.

20:00.317 --> 20:02.986
And by the way, that Namenda.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.989
Oh, man, it's so constipating.

20:06.073 --> 20:07.449
- It... Sorry?
- Sorry about that.

20:07.533 --> 20:11.620
I was backed up for eight days. I felt
like a python that had swallowed a deer.

20:12.955 --> 20:16.792
Charlie, you have medicines
to help you with that,

20:16.875 --> 20:18.794
and you can always give yourself an enema.

20:18.877 --> 20:23.424
I'm saving that for my birthday.
A little something special just for me.

20:24.383 --> 20:25.467
How are you sleeping?

20:26.552 --> 20:29.805
Why sleep when you can
stay up and terrorize yourself?

20:30.723 --> 20:32.683
Maybe I get four hours, maybe.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.685
And what about those flashbacks?

20:35.561 --> 20:37.855
That's the craziest thing.

20:37.938 --> 20:41.483
I can forget what I had for lunch
while I'm having lunch.

20:41.567 --> 20:44.278
But then, something flies into my head,
like, bam!

20:44.361 --> 20:47.740
It could be a moment,
a fragment, a sentence.

20:47.823 --> 20:49.450
And it's like I'm there.

20:49.533 --> 20:53.370
Like I can see it like I saw it
way back then. It doesn't...

20:53.454 --> 20:57.082
It's almost like I can smell things.
And then, black.

20:57.166 --> 21:00.544
It just goes black,
and it goes as fast as it came.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.629
It's the craziest thing.

21:05.132 --> 21:08.802
- How's the writing going?
- I think it helps.

21:08.886 --> 21:12.473
It keeps my mind active, and it helps
strengthen my denial.

21:12.556 --> 21:15.851
You know what, this show,
it's all of these young kids.

21:15.934 --> 21:19.688
I'm like the old man on the block whose
yard you don't wanna hit the ball into.

21:20.564 --> 21:23.359
But I still get stuff on the air.

21:23.442 --> 21:25.861
I still help shape the show,

21:25.944 --> 21:29.490
and when one of my jokes hits right,
and the audience laughs,

21:29.573 --> 21:30.991
there's still nothing like it.

21:31.075 --> 21:33.535
And I still love it.

21:33.619 --> 21:35.788
Good. I think you're doing well.

21:35.871 --> 21:40.584
We're keeping this at bay,
but it's so damn unpredictable.

21:40.668 --> 21:45.297
Don't let your denial
overrule your sense of reason.

21:45.381 --> 21:48.550
There's a lot we still don't know
about this kind of dementia.

21:50.552 --> 21:51.387
Okay.

21:52.805 --> 21:54.723
- See you next month.
- Okay.

21:54.807 --> 21:57.351
- Unless you need me sooner.
- Okay.

21:57.434 --> 21:59.103
Thanks, my friend.

22:00.813 --> 22:03.607
Oh, by the way, I thought
the show last week was pretty good.

22:03.691 --> 22:05.067
Was it?

22:05.150 --> 22:08.404
- Who was on?
- You know, the guy, what's-his-name?

22:08.487 --> 22:12.491
The... From the film. He's married to...

22:12.908 --> 22:14.243
The one with the hair.

22:16.161 --> 22:18.497
Would you like some of my meds?

22:51.822 --> 22:56.744
You just gonna push the lady down, huh?
You just gonna run over somebody!

22:56.827 --> 22:58.078
You son of a bitch!

22:58.162 --> 23:01.582
Come back here and try that again,
you spineless bastard!

23:02.916 --> 23:04.585
Hey, hey, hey.

23:04.668 --> 23:06.462
What happened?

23:09.381 --> 23:14.219
I was going up the right, when I got
into a head-on collision with a dumbass

23:14.303 --> 23:18.432
who was coming down on the right side,
but really that's his left side.

23:18.515 --> 23:21.226
And it's all his fault
because this isn't England!

23:21.310 --> 23:23.395
How did you know where I live?

23:23.479 --> 23:24.813
- Google.
- Google?

23:24.897 --> 23:26.523
- Here.
- What's this?

23:26.607 --> 23:29.526
The first installment
of the money I owe you.

23:31.153 --> 23:33.113
You're a pole dancer?

23:33.197 --> 23:37.660
God, no. And this coming from a man
that makes America laugh for a living.

23:37.743 --> 23:39.036
My knee!

23:39.119 --> 23:42.414
- My fucking knees!
- Listen, listen, come upstairs.

23:42.498 --> 23:46.251
I'll clean you up a little bit,
and then we can rinse out your mouth.

23:46.335 --> 23:47.795
Come on.

23:49.421 --> 23:53.634
Oh, okay, okay,

23:54.593 --> 23:55.678
Jeez.

23:56.595 --> 24:00.557
Man, this dude is doing it. This is nice.

24:01.725 --> 24:03.811
You know a lot of old white people.

24:04.603 --> 24:06.855
Oprah Winfrey?

24:08.023 --> 24:09.775
"For Carrie"?

24:10.984 --> 24:12.486
Okay, here we go.

24:12.569 --> 24:16.990
According to this wall, not only are you
ancient, but you're also famous.

24:17.074 --> 24:17.950
Sit here.

24:26.625 --> 24:28.585
You a serial killer?

24:28.669 --> 24:31.588
- What do you mean?
- Well, isn't that what serial killers do?

24:31.672 --> 24:35.300
Collect pictures of everyone they
butchered and buried in their backyard?

24:36.427 --> 24:38.053
Other knee.

24:41.265 --> 24:43.267
- Who are they?
- Who?

24:45.352 --> 24:47.354
Oh, that's my family.

24:48.188 --> 24:50.607
Why do you have
their names written down?

24:51.316 --> 24:55.070
I'm writing something about them,
and it helps me stay focused.

24:56.071 --> 24:57.406
How did you become a writer?

24:58.615 --> 25:01.410
I don't think you become one.
I think you just are.

25:02.202 --> 25:03.871
When I was a kid I thought it was fun

25:03.954 --> 25:06.123
to take the truth
and make it more interesting.

25:06.832 --> 25:07.833
So you're a liar?

25:09.043 --> 25:11.253
I'm just kidding. That's beautiful.

25:11.337 --> 25:13.422
Yeah. Well, you're as good as new.

25:14.173 --> 25:15.049
Thanks.

25:16.884 --> 25:17.926
What was here?

25:18.594 --> 25:20.596
There was some picture that fell.

25:20.679 --> 25:22.639
Housekeeper
put it someplace, I don't know.

25:23.307 --> 25:24.808
Listen, I gotta get back to work.

25:24.892 --> 25:27.895
You gotta get back to making up shit
because your real life is boring?

25:28.520 --> 25:30.064
Something like that, yeah.

25:30.564 --> 25:33.650
Thanks for bringing me the bag
of laundered money.

25:33.734 --> 25:35.652
The Corleones will be very pleased.

25:36.904 --> 25:38.364
But you didn't have to do that.

25:38.447 --> 25:41.200
That's where you're wrong,
old man. I did.

25:42.117 --> 25:42.993
Bye-bye.

25:44.953 --> 25:49.875
Next is Sarah and Roger,
Paula and Gary wrote this.

25:50.501 --> 25:52.795
A cheesy ad for a law firm.

25:53.462 --> 25:55.005
Hello, I'm Jerry Loomis.

25:55.089 --> 25:56.674
And I'm Lorraine Loomis.

25:56.757 --> 25:58.008
When we got married,

25:58.092 --> 26:01.553
the rules of dating were much
less confusing than they are today.

26:01.637 --> 26:03.055
And that's where we come in.

26:03.138 --> 26:04.348
We're the Sex Refs.

26:06.141 --> 26:08.185
We go on your dates with you.

26:08.268 --> 26:10.062
Maintaining a safe distance.

26:10.145 --> 26:11.438
So if there's any hanky...

26:11.522 --> 26:12.439
Or panky.

26:12.523 --> 26:15.734
We're there to help clarify what
both parties' intentions are.

26:15.818 --> 26:17.653
So there's no misunderstandings

26:17.736 --> 26:20.656
that could lead
to accusations and lawsuits.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.368
We deal with the he said-she said
aspects of miscommunication.

26:24.451 --> 26:28.539
For example, you're in a parked car
and she says, "Would you like to kiss me?"

26:28.622 --> 26:30.207
But he said she said:

26:30.290 --> 26:32.584
"Honey, can you please
stick your thumb up my ass?"

26:36.171 --> 26:38.298
Very different, isn't it?

26:38.799 --> 26:39.967
- We think so.
- We think so.

26:40.467 --> 26:43.053
Or if you're at the top
of the Ferris wheel,

26:43.137 --> 26:44.179
and he says:

26:44.263 --> 26:47.474
"I really don't like heights."
But she says he said:

26:47.558 --> 26:49.601
"Wanna see a picture
of my rottweiler's balls?"

26:52.563 --> 26:54.773
Now you see why you need us?

26:55.315 --> 26:58.444
We'll be there to protect you
from vicious accusations,

26:58.527 --> 27:00.863
subpoenas, and defamation suits.

27:00.946 --> 27:03.198
- "Sub-poena"?
- Yeah, remember we're on your side.

27:03.282 --> 27:04.950
No matter what side that is.

27:05.034 --> 27:06.910
- We're Loomis.
- And Loomis.

27:06.994 --> 27:08.704
And we'll see you in court...

27:08.787 --> 27:09.830
- Ship.
- Ship.

27:15.085 --> 27:16.754
That's good. That was good.

27:16.837 --> 27:17.838
It's subtle.

27:17.921 --> 27:19.340
- Yeah.
- So...

27:19.423 --> 27:23.052
Okay, good job.
Next sketch is from Darrell.

27:23.802 --> 27:26.013
Thomas Crapper Jr.

27:26.096 --> 27:29.016
We open on a 19th century
British schoolyard.

27:29.099 --> 27:31.894
A group of 9-year-old children
are milling about

27:31.977 --> 27:35.189
and trying to figure out what they want
to do now that school is let out.

27:35.272 --> 27:37.149
Wanna come over to my house?

27:37.232 --> 27:39.443
No. Your house smells.

27:39.526 --> 27:40.694
How about my house?

27:41.195 --> 27:43.989
No. Your house smells too.

27:44.073 --> 27:45.824
My house doesn't smell.

27:45.908 --> 27:46.742
How come?

27:47.451 --> 27:49.244
I'm Thomas Crapper Jr.

27:49.328 --> 27:52.122
My father invented the flush toilet.

27:52.206 --> 27:54.708
Then let's go over to his house.

27:56.585 --> 27:58.003
All right, all right.

28:00.589 --> 28:02.883
All right, guys. Very funny stuff.

28:02.966 --> 28:04.927
Let's put together a show.

28:05.594 --> 28:06.720
Sex Refs.

28:07.763 --> 28:10.265
You guys wrote a really funny sketch.

28:10.891 --> 28:12.101
But...

28:12.726 --> 28:16.146
But what? Sarah and Roger were hilarious.

28:16.230 --> 28:17.398
- Correct.
- I don't know.

28:17.481 --> 28:19.274
I don't know. Charlie, what do you think?

28:19.358 --> 28:23.570
Very funny idea. But a thumb
up the ass, rottweiler's balls...

28:23.654 --> 28:25.531
What are you talking about?
They got laughs.

28:25.614 --> 28:27.616
Of course they will. They always will.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.159
But is it the right kind of laugh?

28:29.827 --> 28:31.453
Because it's a very smart idea.

28:32.162 --> 28:33.163
Angry Librarians?

28:33.247 --> 28:34.456
- So funny.
- You should do it.

28:34.540 --> 28:35.374
I agree.

28:35.916 --> 28:37.251
Thomas Crapper Jr.

28:37.334 --> 28:38.210
Hell, no.

28:38.293 --> 28:41.005
Yeah. You know,
Darrell's option's coming up

28:41.088 --> 28:43.090
but he still hasn't gotten
a sketch on the air.

28:43.674 --> 28:44.758
It's not that bad.

28:46.301 --> 28:48.303
First of all,
if they spoke in English accents

28:48.387 --> 28:50.222
the way they were supposed to,

28:50.305 --> 28:53.475
it would've been a little bit better
but the whole thing's not framed right.

28:53.559 --> 28:55.602
Give him another shot.
He'll make it better.

28:59.064 --> 29:00.566
Listen, we hired Darrell

29:00.649 --> 29:04.278
because he wrote those
really funny essays for the <i>Lampoon.</i>

29:04.361 --> 29:06.196
I think it's a little hard
to make the leap

29:06.280 --> 29:08.282
from print to live,
that's all. It takes time.

29:08.365 --> 29:09.742
You think he's a good writer?

29:11.452 --> 29:13.495
Yeah. I think it's in there.

29:13.579 --> 29:15.205
But I think it needs to be encouraged.

29:15.289 --> 29:18.334
Listen, you guys
are a very fast crowd to run with

29:18.417 --> 29:22.338
and I also think that Inflection Mangler
Roger should be hit in the head

29:22.421 --> 29:23.922
until he says "subpoena" right.

29:24.006 --> 29:27.718
I mean, come on. "Sub-poena,"
what is that? A very small poena?

29:27.801 --> 29:29.261
That's an inferior poena.

29:29.345 --> 29:32.556
An underground poena? I mean,
what is his problem?

29:33.557 --> 29:35.392
You know, but here's the thing.

29:35.684 --> 29:37.227
There's a music to comedy.

29:37.311 --> 29:39.229
There's a music.
There are notes to comedy.

29:39.313 --> 29:41.023
- He's out of tune.
- We're working on it.

29:41.106 --> 29:43.650
Keep working because it's driving me nuts.

29:43.734 --> 29:46.820
- All right. What's next?
- I have to go.

29:46.904 --> 29:50.199
- I'm sorry, I have my... Excuse me.
- Oh, right.

29:50.282 --> 29:52.284
- Yeah.
- Have a great time.

29:52.368 --> 29:53.202
Thanks.

29:54.119 --> 29:55.037
I wish I could go.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.331
- Hey. You got a job.
- Yeah. All right.

29:57.414 --> 29:58.791
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:58.874 --> 29:59.958
Good night.

30:00.709 --> 30:03.629
They're honoring Charlie

30:03.712 --> 30:06.173
and the whole cast
at the American Film Society

30:06.256 --> 30:08.592
for the 30th anniversary
of <i>Call Me Anytime.</i>

30:09.301 --> 30:12.388
Kevin Kline, Sharon Stone,
Barry Levinson directing.

30:12.471 --> 30:15.099
Such a funny movie. Have you seen it?

30:15.808 --> 30:16.767
Yeah. It's great.

30:18.102 --> 30:20.270
All right. What's up?

30:22.147 --> 30:23.941
Look, you know I love Charlie.

30:24.608 --> 30:26.652
I know he gave you
your start and everything.

30:26.735 --> 30:28.529
But... come on.

30:29.029 --> 30:32.157
I just don't know what he brings
to the show anymore.

30:32.241 --> 30:34.243
Aside from 40 years' experience?

30:34.994 --> 30:37.246
And a body of work that includes shows

30:37.329 --> 30:39.289
that made it possible
for this show to exist?

30:41.750 --> 30:46.588
Look, I know how you
can question Charlie's value.

30:47.297 --> 30:50.426
But he's really smart
and he still writes funny jokes.

30:51.176 --> 30:52.678
And he's my consigliere.

30:53.512 --> 30:56.807
When you write sketches with
a thumb up someone's ass,

30:57.474 --> 30:59.018
or a rottweiler's balls,

30:59.727 --> 31:02.479
he's the one who reminds me
what we should be putting on the air.

31:03.689 --> 31:07.317
Bottom-line, as long as
I am producing this show,

31:07.401 --> 31:08.861
Charlie will be here.

31:10.779 --> 31:13.073
- Okay?
- You got it.

31:13.157 --> 31:14.366
- All right.
- Yeah.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.994
- Let's get back to work.
- Yeah.

31:26.628 --> 31:27.963
Go, go.

31:30.007 --> 31:31.383
Close the door, close the door.

31:33.886 --> 31:34.845
Turn off the lights.

31:36.013 --> 31:37.139
Come here.

31:40.017 --> 31:42.686
I can't do this anymore.

31:42.770 --> 31:43.687
Why?

31:44.521 --> 31:47.441
You're married, I'm married.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

31:47.524 --> 31:48.901
Well, neither do I.

31:50.277 --> 31:52.946
I just don't know what to do.

31:53.030 --> 31:55.741
But wait, wait, wait. Let's make a plan.

31:55.824 --> 31:59.828
Every year, we will meet
here in the Tuckmans' bathroom,

31:59.912 --> 32:01.413
at their Halloween party.

32:02.289 --> 32:05.668
- What about the Tuckmans' Christmas party?
- No, we've got to be strong.

32:10.005 --> 32:12.841
Hi, how are you?
Thank you all for being here.

32:12.925 --> 32:14.885
Good evening, I'm Bob Costas.

32:16.345 --> 32:19.973
Please welcome,
the director of <i>Call Me Anytime,</i>

32:20.057 --> 32:21.225
Barry Levinson.

32:21.308 --> 32:23.560
Its writer, Charlie Burnz,

32:23.644 --> 32:27.898
and its stars,
Kevin Kline and Sharon Stone.

32:34.863 --> 32:37.074
I have to say, right off the top.

32:37.157 --> 32:39.368
I really loved this film.

32:39.451 --> 32:42.037
In fact, I'm bypassing
a Mets-Astros game tonight

32:42.121 --> 32:44.331
just to be here, to do this instead.

32:44.415 --> 32:46.333
All right, so what's the
germ of all this?

32:46.417 --> 32:47.626
How did it all get started?

32:48.502 --> 32:53.841
Well, Charlie and I originally met
on <i>The Carol Burnett Show</i> ages ago.

32:53.924 --> 32:57.177
And he wrote a lot of very funny sketches.

32:57.803 --> 33:02.099
Shy guy, always called me Mr. Levinson.

33:02.182 --> 33:03.642
Even though we were friendly.

33:04.143 --> 33:09.064
All right, what happened was I read
Charlie's script and I thought:

33:09.148 --> 33:10.691
"Well this is a perfect film to do."

33:11.483 --> 33:14.737
So the next day, I get a call
from Barry and he says:

33:14.820 --> 33:17.906
"I just read this script, it's terrific.
You gotta read it.

33:17.990 --> 33:19.700
The character, she's you."

33:19.783 --> 33:23.412
And I said, "She's completely compulsive,
she'll do anything. I'm in."

33:25.247 --> 33:31.170
And then the next day, he called me.
I read the script and then I was in.

33:31.253 --> 33:36.300
Literally three days later, we got a go.
And I called Charlie with the good news.

33:36.383 --> 33:39.553
And so Charlie, you get the call,
what did Barry say?

33:40.137 --> 33:41.138
Who?

33:41.889 --> 33:42.931
Mr. Levinson.

33:44.808 --> 33:48.645
It's so nice to see you.
Nice to... Wow.

33:48.729 --> 33:50.147
It's great to meet you.

33:50.230 --> 33:54.276
I was just thrilled and shocked that...

33:54.360 --> 33:55.569
Mr. Levinson.

33:59.990 --> 34:03.035
Wanted to direct my first...
This was my first screenplay.

34:03.118 --> 34:08.165
And that Kevin Kline was gonna play Ben,
and that... help me.

34:08.247 --> 34:10.209
- Meryl Streep.
- Hello.

34:11.126 --> 34:13.504
Was gonna play Iris.

34:13.587 --> 34:16.631
And I kept thinking,
if my parents were alive,

34:16.714 --> 34:18.425
this good news would've killed them.

34:20.218 --> 34:24.973
Charlie's work is... It's not just comedic,
there's a humanity to it.

34:25.057 --> 34:28.477
And I think it shows
people as real people.

34:28.560 --> 34:30.187
It's exceptional writing.

34:38.278 --> 34:41.448
Hey, old man. You were great up there.

34:41.531 --> 34:44.118
Hey. You were inside?

34:44.201 --> 34:47.413
Yeah. And I loved it. Second installment.

34:47.495 --> 34:50.749
It's a little light, boss.
Please don't break my thumbs.

34:51.917 --> 34:54.878
Well, this is a lovely surprise.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.504
How'd you know about this?

34:56.588 --> 34:57.673
My loser ex.

34:57.756 --> 35:00.718
I used his ticket.
You made me laugh a lot.

35:00.801 --> 35:01.969
I'm really sorry.

35:03.762 --> 35:06.724
No, I like seeing you up there.
It was so cool.

35:06.807 --> 35:08.642
You've done a lot of big things.

35:08.726 --> 35:09.810
I got lucky.

35:09.893 --> 35:12.521
Being good
ain't got nothing to do with luck.

35:13.272 --> 35:14.231
I guess.

35:16.233 --> 35:17.818
Why do you have birds in your hair?

35:17.901 --> 35:18.861
Why not?

35:19.403 --> 35:20.863
Shit, what time is it?

35:21.447 --> 35:23.115
I'm gonna be late for work.

35:23.198 --> 35:24.616
- I gotta go. Come with me.
- Work?

35:24.700 --> 35:25.784
- Yeah. Come on.
- Now?

35:25.868 --> 35:26.702
Yeah.

35:26.785 --> 35:28.120
What do you do?

35:31.957 --> 35:33.751
<i>Up in Harlem, at a table for two</i>

35:33.834 --> 35:36.587
<i>There were four of us
Me, your big feet and you</i>

35:36.670 --> 35:39.381
<i>From your ankles up
I say you sure look sweet</i>

35:39.465 --> 35:42.217
<i>But from there down
There's just too much feet!</i>

35:42.301 --> 35:44.011
<i>Yeah, your feet too big</i>

35:44.094 --> 35:46.930
<i>I don't want ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

35:47.014 --> 35:49.516
<i>I can't use ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

35:49.600 --> 35:52.019
<i>I really hate ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

35:52.102 --> 35:53.687
Your feet's too big!

35:56.523 --> 35:59.443
<i>Where d'ya get 'em?
Where d'ya get 'em?</i>

35:59.526 --> 36:01.904
<i>Your girl, she likes ya
She thinks you're nice</i>

36:01.987 --> 36:04.656
<i>Got what it takes to go to paradise</i>

36:04.740 --> 36:07.368
<i>She likes your face
Said she likes your rig</i>

36:07.451 --> 36:10.412
<i>But, man, oh, man
Them things are too big</i>

36:10.496 --> 36:11.705
<i>Your feet's too big</i>

36:11.789 --> 36:14.667
<i>I don't want ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

36:14.750 --> 36:17.294
<i>I'm mad at ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

36:17.378 --> 36:19.880
<i>I hate ya
'Cause your feet's too big</i>

36:21.340 --> 36:24.218
Yeah, I come from a pretty small family.

36:25.552 --> 36:28.847
My mom and dad were singers.

36:28.931 --> 36:30.265
Mo and Jessie.

36:30.808 --> 36:32.726
They were kind of like
Ashford and Simpson.

36:32.810 --> 36:34.186
But they never made it big

36:34.269 --> 36:37.648
because there was already
an Ashford and Simpson.

36:38.273 --> 36:41.068
We used to have a lot of fun,
they thought me how to harmonize,

36:41.568 --> 36:45.781
and my dad made these
really cool weathervanes.

36:45.864 --> 36:50.119
And my mom, she had these
beautiful dreamcatchers that she makes.

36:50.202 --> 36:53.539
They live just outside of Charlotte.
I love them both to pieces.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.165
They sound great.

36:58.711 --> 37:01.046
I love the way
the air smells after it rains.

37:02.339 --> 37:06.218
Listen, if you ever need my help
with what you're going through right now,

37:06.885 --> 37:09.638
even if you need someone to talk to,
I'm here.

37:09.722 --> 37:13.100
Well, thank you very much.
But what are you talking about?

37:13.809 --> 37:16.186
You forgot Sharon Stone
and Barry Levinson's names?

37:16.854 --> 37:18.522
Oh, that. I get a little tongue tied.

37:18.605 --> 37:19.940
I don't like being on-stage.

37:20.024 --> 37:21.150
And what stage were you on

37:21.233 --> 37:23.652
when you wrote your family's names
under their pictures?

37:23.736 --> 37:25.029
I told you, that's how I work.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.239
It's a project that I'm working on, and...

37:27.322 --> 37:30.617
Look, I know what you told me,
but don't bullshit me, old man.

37:34.747 --> 37:36.498
It started innocently enough.

37:37.249 --> 37:41.337
I'd have trouble remembering things.
A name, a place, a fork.

37:42.254 --> 37:44.214
And I think,
"You're getting older, Charlie.

37:44.298 --> 37:46.050
You know, you're having senior moments."

37:46.925 --> 37:48.969
But one day,
I'm having lunch with this guy,

37:49.053 --> 37:50.846
and I can't remember his name.

37:50.929 --> 37:52.890
He's going on and on and on.

37:52.973 --> 37:54.350
I'm thinking, "Who the hell is this?"

37:54.433 --> 37:56.769
Then he cracks himself up
and he starts laughing.

37:56.852 --> 37:59.646
So I faked laughing.
Just to go along with him.

37:59.730 --> 38:05.069
And while I'm laughing, I'm panicking.
Thinking, "Who the hell is this?"

38:05.152 --> 38:06.570
Did you know him?

38:08.405 --> 38:09.698
He was my son.

38:13.702 --> 38:16.580
Yeah. It's happening.

38:18.290 --> 38:21.001
Jesus, old man. I'm sorry.

38:26.924 --> 38:27.800
Who's Carrie?

38:29.677 --> 38:32.721
I saw that on the title page
at your house.

38:34.723 --> 38:36.141
Carrie was my wife.

38:37.601 --> 38:38.519
She died.

38:40.437 --> 38:41.772
Long time ago.

38:43.941 --> 38:47.319
And I'm writing something for her.

38:48.070 --> 38:50.406
And I have to finish
before my words run out.

38:50.489 --> 38:52.324
When did you start working on it?

38:53.075 --> 38:55.077
About an hour after I was diagnosed.

38:56.078 --> 38:57.329
And how's it going?

38:57.413 --> 38:58.872
It's going really well.

38:59.665 --> 39:02.793
My mama would call that
a crock of lukewarm horseshit.

39:02.876 --> 39:04.461
Don't lie to me, old man.

39:05.045 --> 39:07.589
I know you haven't started
writing one single word.

39:08.674 --> 39:10.342
- Let me see your phone.
- My phone?

39:10.426 --> 39:11.635
- Your phone.
- Okay.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.096
Okay.

39:15.055 --> 39:18.767
This is my name, this is my number, okay?

39:18.851 --> 39:20.602
Now, even if you don't wanna contact me,

39:20.686 --> 39:25.649
I just want you to know that I'm not some
allergic-to-shellfish nut

39:25.733 --> 39:27.484
that's half your age plus four,

39:27.568 --> 39:29.695
that wants to help you
because you helped me.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.905
You don't stop for commas, do you?

39:32.614 --> 39:33.991
Life's too short for commas.

39:41.081 --> 39:43.876
Darrell, this is better.

39:44.543 --> 39:45.919
Try this as a tag.

39:47.087 --> 39:50.215
Let's do it in the dress rehearsal.
What do you think?

39:51.175 --> 39:53.344
Yeah. That's great.

39:53.427 --> 39:54.970
- Are we good?
- Yeah. Thanks.

39:55.054 --> 39:56.347
- Good. Alrighty.
- All right.

39:57.848 --> 39:59.600
Do you want to come to my house and play?

39:59.683 --> 40:01.852
No, your house smells.

40:02.603 --> 40:04.521
Then come to my house and play.

40:04.605 --> 40:07.399
No, your house smells too.

40:08.442 --> 40:11.528
My house doesn't smell. We can play there.

40:11.612 --> 40:13.530
Oh, he's Thomas Crapper's son.

40:13.614 --> 40:15.449
His father invented the flushing toilet.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.910
That's a lot of crap.

40:18.619 --> 40:20.871
Not anymore.

40:20.954 --> 40:22.998
Let's go to his house!

40:23.749 --> 40:29.046
Ah, yes. Thomas Crapper,
the father of the modern toilet.

40:29.129 --> 40:31.173
I'm Jeff Goldblum.

40:34.968 --> 40:41.016
This has been a little-known moment
in indoor plumbing history.

40:42.643 --> 40:46.063
Change your toilet. Change the world.

40:47.022 --> 40:48.941
Commercial break! Two minutes.

40:52.152 --> 40:53.153
Not bad.

40:53.237 --> 40:56.115
- Great fix, Darrell.
- The Goldblum thing was funny.

40:56.198 --> 40:57.074
Thanks.

40:57.157 --> 41:01.370
I think we'll slot it after the third
commercial break. Got one on the air.

41:01.453 --> 41:02.621
All right.

41:04.164 --> 41:06.375
Yeah. Yeah.

41:30.858 --> 41:32.317
<i>How did you meet Carrie?</i>

41:42.077 --> 41:44.997
<i>Come on, old man. How did you two meet?</i>

41:53.297 --> 41:55.215
Damn it, I hate this stuff.

41:56.967 --> 41:58.802
Hey, you know what really does the trick?

42:00.137 --> 42:01.138
What?

42:01.221 --> 42:02.097
Butter.

42:03.098 --> 42:05.267
- Did you just say butter?
- I'm telling you. Butter.

42:05.351 --> 42:08.270
No, really. There's a lot of tar
on the beach this year.

42:08.354 --> 42:12.399
What you do is you take a stick of butter
and just keep rubbing it into the tar

42:12.483 --> 42:15.903
and somehow it breaks it down,
you can just wipe it away

42:15.986 --> 42:18.113
and you don't have to use
that tomahawk of a shell

42:18.197 --> 42:20.115
that you're using
which is probably taking off

42:20.199 --> 42:22.076
all the epidermis
on the bottom of your foot.

42:22.785 --> 42:24.787
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:24.870 --> 42:26.205
I'm Charlie Burnz.

42:26.288 --> 42:27.539
Hello, Charlie Burnz.

42:29.750 --> 42:30.876
I'm Carrie.

42:30.959 --> 42:35.089
Carrie? Is that short for Caren
or Carina or a Catherine?

42:35.589 --> 42:37.716
- Florence.
- Florence?

42:37.800 --> 42:38.717
Don't ask.

42:39.218 --> 42:41.804
Florence. Well that's a great
old-fashioned name.

42:41.887 --> 42:44.014
That's one of the names
of one of my relatives.

42:44.098 --> 42:46.975
I could never imagine
my relatives as babies.

42:47.059 --> 42:48.477
Herman, come away from the water.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.688
Irving, don't put that
puppy in your mouth.

42:50.771 --> 42:54.358
Mildred just pooped in the toilet.
A big hand for Mildred.

42:54.942 --> 42:57.611
- You don't hear those names.
- That's true.

42:59.154 --> 43:02.908
Listen, I live in that white house,
like, right over there.

43:02.991 --> 43:05.911
And I happen to have
like half a ton of butter.

43:05.995 --> 43:07.037
So, if you...

43:07.121 --> 43:11.500
Yeah, I won a dairy contest.
You had to guess how much the cow weighed.

43:11.583 --> 43:13.961
And I can de-tar you.

43:14.044 --> 43:16.338
And I mean that in a very respectful way.

43:18.424 --> 43:19.508
Okay.

43:27.391 --> 43:29.059
Wow, is that a paint-by-number?

43:29.977 --> 43:33.355
It's you again. Hello, Charlie Burnz.

43:33.439 --> 43:34.523
Hey, Carrie.

43:35.190 --> 43:36.233
It's really good.

43:36.316 --> 43:37.860
- Yeah? You like it?
- Yeah.

43:37.943 --> 43:39.528
- You know what else I like?
- What?

43:39.611 --> 43:41.822
- Steamed clams.
- Oh, yeah?

43:41.905 --> 43:44.324
- Yeah.
- I've never had steamed clams.

43:44.408 --> 43:46.535
Okay, my house, 7 p.m.

43:47.995 --> 43:48.829
Deal.

43:50.039 --> 43:55.586
Here we go. Okay, take the clam.
Spread it apart. Rinse it in the broth.

43:56.170 --> 43:59.256
And then to the butter.
And then to your mouth.

43:59.340 --> 44:01.633
It's a little bit of heaven.
Isn't it great?

44:02.384 --> 44:04.219
Oh, God. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

44:04.303 --> 44:05.971
That's disgusting.

44:06.055 --> 44:08.223
- Please don't sue.
- Oh, man.

44:09.516 --> 44:11.352
- Pizza?
- I'll call Gino's.

44:24.948 --> 44:26.784
I just got this rug.

44:27.910 --> 44:29.662
This is like tracking Bigfoot.

44:35.584 --> 44:36.460
Hey.

44:37.419 --> 44:38.420
Hey.

44:38.504 --> 44:39.672
Carrie.

44:40.673 --> 44:41.757
Good morning.

44:46.679 --> 44:47.554
Here.

44:49.264 --> 44:51.558
Good morning, Charlie Burnz.

44:53.310 --> 44:56.313
Here. A little something for breakfast.

44:56.939 --> 44:58.357
It's a beautiful day.

45:03.237 --> 45:04.655
Oh, God.

45:08.325 --> 45:09.493
Okay.

45:11.453 --> 45:12.788
De-tar me.

45:13.372 --> 45:16.208
But it seems a shame to waste
the butter on my foot.

45:17.292 --> 45:18.627
Come here.

45:18.711 --> 45:19.837
Okay.

45:22.506 --> 45:23.382
Hi.

45:39.565 --> 45:41.775
Well, hello. Old friend.

46:33.577 --> 46:38.999
<i>And you can't tell the depth of a well
By the length of the handle on the pump</i>

46:39.083 --> 46:42.544
<i>Baby, how can you tell about me?</i>

46:43.921 --> 46:46.423
<i>Now you can't tell a bottle by the label</i>

46:46.507 --> 46:48.884
<i>That's how it is with me</i>

46:48.967 --> 46:51.804
<i>Some folks call me a ladle,</i>

46:51.887 --> 46:55.724
<i>Give me a chance and you'll see</i>

46:55.808 --> 46:59.978
<i>You can't tell the depth of a well
By the length of the handle on the pump</i>

47:00.062 --> 47:00.896
Thank you, boo.

47:00.979 --> 47:04.650
<i>Baby, baby, baby</i>

47:04.733 --> 47:08.487
<i>Baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby</i>

47:08.570 --> 47:12.366
<i>How can you tell about me? Yeah</i>

47:12.449 --> 47:15.327
All right now,
make sure you make a donation.

47:16.286 --> 47:18.080
Thank you,
we'll see you in a few months.

47:18.163 --> 47:19.456
We're going on tour.

47:19.540 --> 47:23.544
A tour. Four months, 50 cities.
Theaters, clubs.

47:23.627 --> 47:25.504
- And we got a tour bus.
- Can you believe it?

47:25.587 --> 47:27.840
Man, it's awesome. I'm in, all the way.

47:27.923 --> 47:29.883
- Awesome.
- All right guys, I'll see you later.

47:29.967 --> 47:31.510
- See you.
- That's cool.

47:33.012 --> 47:34.096
You sounded great.

47:35.806 --> 47:36.932
What are you doing here?

47:37.016 --> 47:40.811
Em, I'm sorry. I messed up. Please.

47:40.894 --> 47:44.732
It's too late. I've moved on,
I met someone and we're in love.

47:44.815 --> 47:47.693
What? Already? Bullshit.

47:47.776 --> 47:49.695
- He's over there. Wanna meet him?
- Okay.

47:49.778 --> 47:51.864
Come on,
you'll see if it's some bullshit or not.

47:53.032 --> 47:54.658
- Hey.
- Hey, old man.

47:54.742 --> 47:57.745
Hi. Hey, you were great.
I mean, that was just terrific.

47:58.245 --> 47:59.246
What is going on here?

48:00.039 --> 48:04.168
Charlie, this is my ex-boyfriend,
Dwayne St. John.

48:04.793 --> 48:07.421
- Oh, I hear you're a fan. Thank you.
- This is your boyfriend?

48:07.504 --> 48:10.382
- No, he's my bae.
- You used my auction thing!

48:10.466 --> 48:12.551
Oh, yeah, all $22 of it.

48:12.634 --> 48:15.471
And thank you. It's the first day
of the rest of my life.

48:15.554 --> 48:16.388
Ain't that right?

48:17.222 --> 48:18.307
Yeah.

48:18.932 --> 48:22.311
- I love everything you do.
- And now he's doing me.

48:22.394 --> 48:24.146
Ain't that right, Charlie?

48:24.229 --> 48:26.190
You got that right... baby.

48:27.441 --> 48:28.817
We are late for lunch.

48:28.901 --> 48:32.571
And I would love
a seafood salad right now.

48:33.489 --> 48:35.824
- Okay.
- This is so crazy.

48:36.825 --> 48:39.244
In acting class,
I was doing the scene from your play...

48:39.328 --> 48:40.829
Do you wanna just take a picture?

48:41.497 --> 48:43.999
- Could I? Okay with you, sir?
- Sure.

48:44.083 --> 48:47.044
- Man, this is amazing.
- I'll take it. I know the password.

48:47.586 --> 48:49.129
All right, get closer.

48:50.047 --> 48:51.340
Okay, now, smile.

48:51.423 --> 48:54.134
Put your hands up in the air.
Yeah, like you won something.

48:56.261 --> 48:58.013
There you go. Okay.
Charlie, come up here.

48:58.097 --> 48:59.765
Is this good enough?

49:02.351 --> 49:06.480
Now you'll always remember
what me and your idol look like together.

49:06.563 --> 49:07.648
Bye-bye.

49:13.737 --> 49:15.864
- You okay?
- I will be.

49:16.699 --> 49:19.451
- I want some ice cream.
- Okay.

49:19.535 --> 49:22.079
And a triple vegan delight.

49:22.162 --> 49:24.415
Wow, that looks like the Olympic torch.

49:25.249 --> 49:26.959
Hey, I gotta change the name.

49:30.879 --> 49:32.506
So when would you leave?

49:33.173 --> 49:36.301
In like a month or so.
It's crazy how things happened.

49:36.385 --> 49:40.180
This record producer saw our videos and...

49:40.848 --> 49:43.517
he was digging us,
next thing you know, bam!

49:43.600 --> 49:47.146
We going on tour for four months,
on a tour bus,

49:47.229 --> 49:50.357
and we're already
talking about doing an album, it's...

49:50.441 --> 49:53.986
Charlie, I'm sorry. I'm doing all the
talking. You said something good happened?

49:54.862 --> 49:57.865
- I wrote last night.
- You did? That's awesome.

49:57.948 --> 49:59.783
It was fantastic. Just like the old days.

49:59.867 --> 50:02.703
Itzhak Perlman starting playing,
and I started writing.

50:03.329 --> 50:05.122
Izzy Perlman? Who's Izzy Perlman?

50:05.205 --> 50:06.623
Not Izzy Perlman.

50:06.707 --> 50:09.626
Izzy Pearlman
sold my parents' Venetian blinds.

50:09.710 --> 50:13.505
Itzhak Perlman is one
of the greatest violinists in the world.

50:13.589 --> 50:14.965
Ask your phone who he is!

50:15.049 --> 50:18.385
He lives in the building behind me
and he likes to practice at night.

50:18.469 --> 50:21.930
I just open my window
and it's like a free Itzhak festival.

50:22.014 --> 50:24.099
One of the reasons
Carrie and I bought the place.

50:30.773 --> 50:32.274
What was that for?

50:32.358 --> 50:35.277
Don't think I would've written anything
if you didn't get me started.

50:37.237 --> 50:39.114
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

50:42.493 --> 50:43.410
Hey...

50:44.203 --> 50:46.497
- Are you doing anything right now?
- No.

50:47.247 --> 50:49.917
It's my day off. Wanna have some laughs?

50:50.000 --> 50:52.419
- Hell, yeah.
- Come on.

50:53.170 --> 50:55.964
- Wax museum?
- Trust me, it's fun.

50:56.048 --> 50:57.633
Don't tell me there's one of you.

50:57.716 --> 50:59.259
- Come on.
- Okay.

51:01.053 --> 51:03.639
This is Marilyn Monroe
from <i>The Seven Year Itch.</i>

51:04.306 --> 51:07.851
I'd be itchy too if I had
hot subway air blowing up my ass.

51:07.935 --> 51:09.687
Is that who I think it is?

51:10.979 --> 51:13.232
Hello, Dalai.

51:13.315 --> 51:15.651
Come on, queen. Smile, girl. Smile.

51:17.403 --> 51:19.488
What could he possibly be thinking?

51:21.073 --> 51:23.450
"Shouldn't have had the seafood salad."

51:24.660 --> 51:26.245
- Picasso.
- I don't dig him.

51:26.328 --> 51:27.204
- Why?
- Sexist.

51:27.287 --> 51:30.040
If I did a painting of you
with three willies, would you be happy?

51:30.124 --> 51:31.291
I'd be ecstatic.

51:32.668 --> 51:36.797
The Theory of Relativity
is never lend your relatives money.

51:36.880 --> 51:39.091
You can kiss that ten bucks goodbye.

51:42.052 --> 51:43.804
Golda, tell me again.
I don't understand.

51:43.887 --> 51:45.180
Okay, Mr. Arafat.

51:45.264 --> 51:47.725
It's "Chanukah," not "Hanukkah."

51:47.808 --> 51:49.351
I'm having trouble with the...

51:49.435 --> 51:51.353
I'm having trouble with the...!

51:51.979 --> 51:53.897
Pope? Party of five?

51:54.648 --> 51:57.735
- I am not a crook.
- Oh, bullshit, Dickie.

51:57.818 --> 51:59.486
Then why are you so sweaty?

52:00.029 --> 52:01.905
Man, he is really cross-eyed.

52:01.989 --> 52:05.034
That's why he didn't find
any weapons of mass destruction.

52:08.579 --> 52:10.289
- So you have two kids, right?
- Yeah.

52:10.372 --> 52:14.043
Francine teaches math
at a middle school in New Jersey.

52:14.126 --> 52:16.170
And my son Rex is an architect.

52:16.253 --> 52:18.213
And Rex is a...

52:19.048 --> 52:20.758
He's a pretty brilliant kid.

52:20.841 --> 52:24.136
He should be. He was born
at the American Museum of Natural History.

52:25.846 --> 52:28.140
This was so nice. Thank you.

52:31.268 --> 52:35.105
I wanna ask you a question.
And I'm a little nervous about it,

52:35.189 --> 52:38.275
because I don't remember
the last time I asked this, if ever.

52:40.819 --> 52:44.114
Would like to be my date
for my granddaughter's bat mitzvah?

52:44.198 --> 52:47.034
Her name's Lindsay
and she's the love of my life.

52:47.117 --> 52:48.994
And it would be
like a goodbye party for you

52:49.078 --> 52:51.205
except it's a bat mitzvah and not for you.

52:51.288 --> 52:53.707
I've never been to one before. When is it?

52:54.875 --> 52:57.628
- I don't remember, but soon.
- Way to narrow it down.

52:57.711 --> 53:01.090
- I have the invitation...
- Doesn't matter when.

53:01.173 --> 53:02.841
- I'd be happy to go.
- Yeah?

53:02.925 --> 53:04.927
- But only on one condition.
- What?

53:05.636 --> 53:06.804
That we dance together.

53:06.887 --> 53:09.598
Oh, no, no, no. You don't understand.
I'm a dangerous dancer.

53:09.682 --> 53:11.642
One of the few with mambo insurance.

53:11.725 --> 53:14.561
Oh, come on, Charlie.
It'll be so much fun.

53:15.187 --> 53:19.191
All right. But to be on the safe side,
wear a helmet and shoulder pads.

53:19.274 --> 53:21.318
- Done.
- Great.

53:49.471 --> 53:51.056
What's the matter, Carrie?

53:51.140 --> 53:53.434
I don't want the summer to be over.

53:53.517 --> 53:54.601
Well...

53:55.477 --> 53:58.230
maybe we just keep
our summer going forever.

54:00.482 --> 54:02.067
Good idea, Charlie Burnz.

54:24.089 --> 54:26.550
Stop sign... Left.

54:27.551 --> 54:29.928
Whoa, sorry, pal.
You can't go this way. Not safe.

54:30.012 --> 54:33.057
- This is the way I go.
- Sir, go this way. Not safe here.

54:33.140 --> 54:35.934
- I don't know that way.
- You gotta go that way.

54:36.018 --> 54:38.854
I don't know that way,
this is the way I go every day.

54:38.937 --> 54:41.315
It's a new day.
Cross the street and you'll be fine.

54:41.398 --> 54:44.318
- No! I have to go this way!
- Come on. Move!

54:48.072 --> 54:49.281
Sorry.

54:49.365 --> 54:51.116
What's the matter with you?

54:54.995 --> 54:58.749
That's the way I go. I go that way.

55:03.170 --> 55:06.423
What, are you crazy?
What are you doing?

55:07.049 --> 55:08.842
Get the hell out of the way!

55:10.177 --> 55:11.053
Hey!

55:11.887 --> 55:13.263
You, old man!

55:14.306 --> 55:17.935
Get the hell out of the way!
You're in the middle of the road!

55:18.727 --> 55:19.937
What, are you deaf?

56:00.227 --> 56:04.606
<i>Hey, old man! Am I crazy or did you say
your son was born in a museum?</i>

56:07.151 --> 56:09.737
Look at the size of this thing, honey.

56:09.820 --> 56:11.613
- Charlie...
- This is the only thing here

56:11.697 --> 56:14.408
that's bigger than you.
Look at that wishbone!

56:14.491 --> 56:15.784
- Charlie.
- What?

56:16.577 --> 56:18.245
I think my water just broke.

56:19.121 --> 56:22.708
We gotta get you out of here.
We gotta get you out of here.

56:25.085 --> 56:27.629
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Honey... I need a doctor!

56:27.713 --> 56:29.757
- I need a doctor!
- What's the problem?

56:29.840 --> 56:31.258
- My wife's having a baby.
- When?

56:31.342 --> 56:32.885
- Now!
- I'm gonna ask the supervisor

56:32.968 --> 56:34.887
- if that's okay.
- Are you kidding me?!

56:34.970 --> 56:36.597
- I am a doctor.
- What kind?

56:36.680 --> 56:38.515
- Proctologist. Okay.
- Close enough.

56:38.599 --> 56:40.601
Oh, God. This baby's coming fast.

56:40.684 --> 56:43.187
Can you do it somewhere else?
A tour group's coming through.

56:43.270 --> 56:45.230
Really?! I have a baby coming through!

56:45.314 --> 56:47.524
Take a deep breath. Relax.
Call an ambulance now.

56:47.608 --> 56:49.485
- Copy that.
- Hi.

56:49.568 --> 56:52.071
- You should know my name. It's Carrie.
- Hi. Hello.

56:52.154 --> 56:54.698
And that man
who looks so scared is Charlie.

56:54.782 --> 56:57.409
- Hi, Charlie.
- He's the daddy.

56:57.493 --> 56:58.661
- Good.
- What's your name?

56:58.744 --> 57:02.581
I'm Joe Katz. Okay? Take a breath.
Relax. You're doing just great.

57:02.665 --> 57:05.459
Now, listen.
I'll have to remove your underwear.

57:05.542 --> 57:08.796
Oh, that's a bit aggressive
for our first date, don't you think?

57:08.879 --> 57:09.963
There we go.

57:11.048 --> 57:12.800
- What should I do next?
- Nothing!

57:12.883 --> 57:14.718
Sure? They gave us a class with the doll...

57:14.802 --> 57:16.387
- Leave us alone!
- Okay. Sorry.

57:16.470 --> 57:19.890
Charlie. This is like that time
at Rye Playland, remember?

57:19.973 --> 57:22.976
At the top of the Ferris wheel?
We were so drunk!

57:23.811 --> 57:25.479
- You okay?
- Just trying to think.

57:25.562 --> 57:27.981
Who took your panties off
at Rye Playland? I wasn't there.

57:28.065 --> 57:29.817
- What?
- It was Coney Island!

57:29.900 --> 57:31.860
Oh, you're right!

57:31.944 --> 57:34.154
- Oh, God.
- Lean forward slowly.

57:34.238 --> 57:36.657
And you're gonna push when I tell you.

57:36.740 --> 57:39.326
Carrie, you're doing great.
Hey! What are you looking at?

57:40.119 --> 57:42.663
- And get these scouts out of here!
- Come on, guys. Let's go.

57:42.746 --> 57:44.832
- Come on, boys.
- This is bullshit!

57:45.624 --> 57:47.668
- You too!
- Copy that. And just a reminder:

57:47.751 --> 57:49.712
- we close at 5.
- Get out of here!

57:50.337 --> 57:52.464
Okay. The baby's here. The baby's here.

57:52.548 --> 57:55.217
Pull a big deep breath
and a big push, okay?

57:55.300 --> 57:57.428
- You can do it. There you go.
- Okay.

58:05.811 --> 58:08.647
Okay. Here you go. Here you go.

58:08.731 --> 58:09.773
Here you go.

58:10.607 --> 58:14.069
It's a boy. It's a boy. It's a boy.

58:16.739 --> 58:17.823
<i>Hey, Charlie.</i>

58:17.906 --> 58:18.991
Yeah?

58:20.367 --> 58:21.869
Let's name him Rex.

58:24.705 --> 58:26.540
That's the perfect name.

58:28.584 --> 58:31.420
I'm really glad we didn't have him
under that big whale.

58:31.503 --> 58:36.675
Yeah. Because Moby Dick Burnz
would be a terrible name for our son.

58:36.759 --> 58:38.886
He'd have so much trouble at school.

58:40.471 --> 58:43.140
Oh, I love you, Charlie Burnz.

58:45.642 --> 58:46.935
I love you too.

59:19.760 --> 59:23.764
All right, Roger.
We'll cue you in five, four...

59:23.847 --> 59:26.517
Three, two, one...

59:27.059 --> 59:28.894
Good evening.
And welcome to another episode

59:28.977 --> 59:31.355
of <i>Old People Who Have
Always Looked Old!</i>

59:31.438 --> 59:34.817
Tonight's subjects are Keith Richards
and the late Mother Teresa.

59:34.900 --> 59:37.069
- Oh, boy. Did you hear it?
- Yeah.

59:37.152 --> 59:39.154
- How does he get away with this?
- I don't know.

59:39.905 --> 59:41.073
All right, listen.

59:42.074 --> 59:44.868
The sketch ideas are good,
but they don't always have to be so big.

59:44.952 --> 59:47.705
Sketches can be small, more personal.

59:47.788 --> 59:50.833
Something about yourself,
maybe about your girlfriend or something.

59:50.916 --> 59:53.002
- That would be a problem.
- Why's that?

59:53.085 --> 59:55.963
I don't have one. I'm incredibly single.

59:56.046 --> 59:57.464
See? That's funny.

59:57.548 --> 59:59.967
That I eat every meal alone?

1:00:00.050 --> 1:00:02.469
- Oh, that's hilarious.
- No, no.

1:00:02.553 --> 1:00:04.722
I'm talking
about a character for the show.

1:00:04.805 --> 1:00:07.975
The incredibly single guy.
It's different than being single.

1:00:08.058 --> 1:00:11.020
It's incredibly single.
There might be something funny in that.

1:00:11.103 --> 1:00:12.938
- Right.
- Find out what's funny about you

1:00:13.022 --> 1:00:16.233
- and then write about it.
- Okay. I'll try that.

1:00:16.316 --> 1:00:19.069
- Okay.
- Can I tell you something?

1:00:19.153 --> 1:00:20.029
Yeah.

1:00:20.696 --> 1:00:23.115
When I was at Harvard,
I had a humor class

1:00:23.198 --> 1:00:25.117
and I wrote a paper as you.

1:00:26.076 --> 1:00:27.369
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:00:27.453 --> 1:00:30.831
I read all your plays,
I knew your movie scripts.

1:00:30.914 --> 1:00:34.668
I could even tell what jokes were yours
on whatever TV show you were writing on.

1:00:34.752 --> 1:00:38.047
So I wrote a paper in your style.
Like you were at Harvard.

1:00:39.173 --> 1:00:40.215
And how'd it do?

1:00:41.133 --> 1:00:41.967
Got an F.

1:00:43.052 --> 1:00:46.013
The professor said
we already have a great Charlie Burnz.

1:00:46.096 --> 1:00:49.141
We don't have a great Darrell Green yet.
He was right.

1:00:50.017 --> 1:00:54.813
Anyway, working with you
and knowing you is really special to me.

1:00:54.897 --> 1:00:56.148
Oh, thank you, Darrell.

1:00:56.774 --> 1:00:59.777
Listen, while I go get one of the crew

1:00:59.860 --> 1:01:02.654
to vacuum out the smoke
you just blew up my ass,

1:01:02.738 --> 1:01:05.949
take a whack at the incredibly single guy,
see if there's something funny.

1:01:06.033 --> 1:01:08.494
- Deal.
- Good. Oh, sorry.

1:01:10.412 --> 1:01:12.247
Hello? Hi.

1:01:12.998 --> 1:01:14.875
Hi, yeah. No, I...

1:01:16.126 --> 1:01:17.211
What to wear?

1:01:18.170 --> 1:01:19.088
Oh, I don't...

1:01:20.422 --> 1:01:23.384
How vintage? That's very vintage.

1:01:23.467 --> 1:01:24.635
Yeah.

1:01:24.718 --> 1:01:27.721
No, listen. I'm at work,
so can I call you back?

1:01:28.305 --> 1:01:30.516
Okay. Bye.

1:01:33.769 --> 1:01:36.814
I'm taking a date
to my granddaughter's bat mitzvah.

1:01:37.398 --> 1:01:40.609
She's a... really fun person.
Never been to one before.

1:01:40.693 --> 1:01:42.319
Neither have I. Can I go too?

1:01:43.570 --> 1:01:46.031
I think one surprise for my family
is all they can handle.

1:01:46.115 --> 1:01:48.617
And believe me,
this young woman is full of surprises.

1:01:48.701 --> 1:01:50.577
- She sounds cool.
- Yeah, she is.

1:01:50.661 --> 1:01:52.997
She's... She's very cool.

1:01:55.499 --> 1:01:57.584
- What?
- Well...

1:01:57.668 --> 1:01:58.836
you're blushing.

1:01:58.919 --> 1:02:01.672
- Your face is a little red.
- Oh, that's...

1:02:01.755 --> 1:02:03.590
blood pressure. Yeah.

1:02:03.674 --> 1:02:05.592
Shouldn't have had the hot dog. It's...

1:02:05.676 --> 1:02:07.761
- See you in a little bit.
- Bye.

1:02:09.430 --> 1:02:14.018
Now that I'm a bat mitzvah girl,
I'd like to leave you with this one story.

1:02:14.685 --> 1:02:17.688
So I turned to Rabbi Teplis and I said:

1:02:17.771 --> 1:02:20.274
"I've been studying for years and years

1:02:20.357 --> 1:02:22.693
and I ask you:
'What is the meaning of life?'

1:02:22.776 --> 1:02:25.112
And you tell me life is a cookie?"

1:02:28.032 --> 1:02:30.617
And Rabbi Teplis looked at me and said:

1:02:30.701 --> 1:02:32.077
"You mean it isn't?"

1:02:37.082 --> 1:02:39.626
So anyways, to my parents,

1:02:39.710 --> 1:02:41.754
I love you so much.

1:02:43.005 --> 1:02:44.798
You've given me everything I have,

1:02:44.882 --> 1:02:47.468
and I wouldn't be here without you.

1:02:48.260 --> 1:02:50.888
Thank you so much. I love you.

1:02:51.722 --> 1:02:54.391
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

1:03:01.148 --> 1:03:03.484
Let's get Lindsay up in the chair!

1:03:05.736 --> 1:03:07.863
One, two, three!

1:03:10.032 --> 1:03:12.159
Look out. Here comes Mom!

1:03:12.242 --> 1:03:13.869
Up in the air, Francine.

1:03:14.953 --> 1:03:17.998
Bend your knees, boys.
Here comes Papa Charlie!

1:03:20.668 --> 1:03:22.211
Mazel tov!

1:03:25.172 --> 1:03:26.256
Come on. Sit down.

1:03:30.678 --> 1:03:32.638
This is amazing!

1:03:32.721 --> 1:03:34.807
That's it, God. I'm converted!

1:03:46.944 --> 1:03:47.778
Hi.

1:03:48.696 --> 1:03:51.031
I'm Francine. I'm Lindsay's mom.

1:03:51.115 --> 1:03:53.867
She is so special. You must be so proud.

1:03:53.951 --> 1:03:56.245
- Yeah.
- I'm Emma, by the way.

1:03:56.328 --> 1:03:57.997
- Oh, hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:02.042
- Yes, nice to meet you.
- These spare ribs are delicious!

1:04:02.126 --> 1:04:03.711
Oh, good.

1:04:03.794 --> 1:04:05.921
So how long
have you been dating my father?

1:04:06.005 --> 1:04:09.258
What? No, no, no. We're just friends.

1:04:10.009 --> 1:04:10.843
I'm sure.

1:04:10.926 --> 1:04:12.928
No. He's just really nice to me.

1:04:13.679 --> 1:04:14.930
And I just love his writing.

1:04:17.099 --> 1:04:19.226
Okay. So...

1:04:19.309 --> 1:04:22.062
So, what do you do, Emma?
For a living, I mean.

1:04:22.146 --> 1:04:23.063
I'm a singer.

1:04:24.481 --> 1:04:26.567
Anything I might be familiar with?

1:04:26.650 --> 1:04:27.484
No.

1:04:28.068 --> 1:04:32.614
But we got a whole bunch of videos
that are blowing up on Instagram.

1:04:33.657 --> 1:04:36.076
- Cool.
- You should come check us out.

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:38.454
- We perform all over the city.
- Where?

1:04:39.538 --> 1:04:41.915
- Mostly underground.
- Like clubs?

1:04:42.833 --> 1:04:45.502
Sometimes, but more so subway stations.

1:04:45.586 --> 1:04:49.631
Like Columbus Circle,
Union Square, Penn Station.

1:04:49.715 --> 1:04:52.217
You gotta check us out. You know what?

1:04:52.301 --> 1:04:55.387
I'm gonna get me some more ribs
because I love meat.

1:04:55.471 --> 1:04:57.681
Anything I could pet, I eat.

1:05:12.279 --> 1:05:13.113
Lindsay...

1:05:13.864 --> 1:05:17.868
I have to tell you how proud I am of you
that you wanted to have this bat mitzvah.

1:05:18.702 --> 1:05:20.537
And I wanna give you something.

1:05:25.959 --> 1:05:27.002
This...

1:05:27.544 --> 1:05:29.588
This was your Grandma Carrie's.

1:05:31.590 --> 1:05:32.925
And now it's yours.

1:05:35.177 --> 1:05:36.637
Put your hair back.

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.180
See if I can...

1:05:39.014 --> 1:05:41.058
Good. Oh, it looks perfect.

1:05:41.141 --> 1:05:43.227
- It's really pretty.
- Yeah.

1:05:43.894 --> 1:05:45.270
I'm giving you this...

1:05:45.979 --> 1:05:48.273
because today is the first big step...

1:05:49.149 --> 1:05:50.693
with so many more to come.

1:05:51.819 --> 1:05:54.655
And I'll be there for you for all of that.

1:05:56.281 --> 1:05:59.076
And I can't wait
to see who you're gonna become.

1:06:01.203 --> 1:06:02.538
I love you.

1:06:03.914 --> 1:06:04.915
I love you too.

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:07.835
Thank you, Papa.

1:06:12.548 --> 1:06:16.260
Hey, Dad, by the way...
I got that job I was telling you about.

1:06:17.511 --> 1:06:18.512
What job?

1:06:19.638 --> 1:06:20.931
The building in Union Square.

1:06:21.932 --> 1:06:24.143
Yeah. Anyway, they love my design.

1:06:24.226 --> 1:06:26.812
Great. Isn't that great?

1:06:26.895 --> 1:06:29.690
Good going, kid. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

1:06:31.775 --> 1:06:35.279
That's great, huh?
You know, Rex is an architect.

1:06:35.362 --> 1:06:38.991
I know. Anyone who's born in a museum
is bound to be smart.

1:06:39.074 --> 1:06:41.994
- He told you about that?
- Yeah, he's very proud of you.

1:06:44.496 --> 1:06:47.249
- And this is her first bat mitzvah.
- What do you think so far?

1:06:47.333 --> 1:06:49.585
- It's okay so far.
- Just okay?

1:06:49.668 --> 1:06:54.048
In the beginning, it was really hot
with the dancing and the chairs up, but-

1:06:54.131 --> 1:06:57.718
All due respect to your tribe,
but it's a little dull now.

1:06:57.801 --> 1:07:00.179
Well, the reading. It'll pick up again.

1:07:00.262 --> 1:07:02.556
Well, why don't we do something
to help a little?

1:07:02.639 --> 1:07:03.932
Where you going?

1:07:04.767 --> 1:07:06.393
Dad. Dad!

1:07:07.770 --> 1:07:09.355
Hey, hey, hey.

1:07:09.438 --> 1:07:11.774
Do you have the instrumental for...?

1:07:16.070 --> 1:07:20.032
Good evening, everybody.
My name is Emma Payge.

1:07:20.115 --> 1:07:23.744
I'm a very good friend
of Papa Charlie's, and Lindsay?

1:07:23.827 --> 1:07:26.497
Could you please come on down
to the dance floor?

1:07:27.831 --> 1:07:31.669
This is my first time ever
coming to a bat mitzvah.

1:07:31.752 --> 1:07:34.755
And I have to say,
so far, I feel so welcome.

1:07:34.838 --> 1:07:36.507
I'm having such a good time.

1:07:36.590 --> 1:07:38.509
DJ, hit that beat.

1:07:39.218 --> 1:07:41.136
And this one's for you, Lindsay.

1:07:41.220 --> 1:07:43.681
If you know the words
to the song, sing along.

1:07:43.764 --> 1:07:46.934
If you don't, I wanna see you
dancing your heart out.

1:07:47.017 --> 1:07:53.732
<i>Oh, come on
Come on, come on, come on</i>

1:07:53.816 --> 1:08:00.572
<i>Didn't I make you feel
Like you are the only man?</i>

1:08:01.699 --> 1:08:03.409
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1:08:05.285 --> 1:08:08.998
<i>Didn't I nearly give you everything
a woman possibly can?</i>

1:08:11.166 --> 1:08:16.130
<i>And each time I tell myself
That I think I've had enough</i>

1:08:16.213 --> 1:08:19.090
<i>But what I'm gonna show you, baby</i>

1:08:19.174 --> 1:08:21.385
<i>That a woman can be tough</i>

1:08:21.468 --> 1:08:27.683
<i>Oh, come on
Come on, come on, come on</i>

1:08:27.766 --> 1:08:28.976
<i>And take it!</i>

1:08:29.059 --> 1:08:33.063
<i>Take another little piece
Of my heart now, baby</i>

1:08:33.147 --> 1:08:34.857
<i>Oh, break it!</i>

1:08:34.940 --> 1:08:38.527
<i>Break another little piece
Of my heart, yeah, darling</i>

1:08:39.236 --> 1:08:40.528
<i>Oh, have a...!</i>

1:08:40.612 --> 1:08:44.575
<i>Have another little piece
Of my heart, yeah, baby</i>

1:08:45.576 --> 1:08:50.873
<i>You know you got it
If it makes you feel good</i>

1:08:53.334 --> 1:08:55.461
Come here, baby. Yeah.

1:08:56.586 --> 1:09:00.340
<i>You're out there on the streets
All looking good</i>

1:09:00.424 --> 1:09:04.219
<i>And baby, deep down in your heart
You know that ain't right</i>

1:09:07.181 --> 1:09:11.934
<i>Never, never, never, never,
Never hear me when I cry</i>

1:09:14.146 --> 1:09:19.026
<i>But each time I tell myself
That I can't stand the pain</i>

1:09:19.108 --> 1:09:24.156
<i>When you hold me in your arms
I'll sing it once again</i>

1:09:24.238 --> 1:09:28.202
- No. Dad, she's...
- She's fantastic. She's fantastic.

1:09:28.285 --> 1:09:30.662
<i>...come on, come on</i>

1:09:30.746 --> 1:09:31.705
<i>And take it!</i>

1:09:31.789 --> 1:09:35.834
<i>Take another little piece
Of my heart, yeah, baby</i>

1:09:37.878 --> 1:09:41.173
<i>Break another little piece
Of my heart, yeah, darling</i>

1:09:42.007 --> 1:09:43.342
<i>Oh, have a...!</i>

1:09:43.425 --> 1:09:47.345
<i>Have another little piece
Of my heart, yeah, baby</i>

1:09:48.347 --> 1:09:53.477
<i>You know you got it
If it makes you feel good</i>

1:09:55.688 --> 1:09:57.940
All right. I see you!

1:09:59.149 --> 1:09:59.983
There you go.

1:10:01.276 --> 1:10:02.111
Yeah.

1:10:02.778 --> 1:10:03.612
Look here.

1:10:04.154 --> 1:10:06.365
<i>I'mma need you to come on</i>

1:10:06.448 --> 1:10:08.117
No. No, thank you.

1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:10.703
<i>Come on, come on</i>

1:10:10.786 --> 1:10:11.954
<i>And take it!</i>

1:10:12.037 --> 1:10:15.666
<i>Take another little piece
Of my heart, yeah, baby</i>

1:10:16.542 --> 1:10:17.710
<i>Break it!</i>

1:10:17.793 --> 1:10:21.046
<i>Break another little piece
Of my heart, yeah, darling</i>

1:10:23.507 --> 1:10:26.969
<i>Have another little piece
Of my heart, yeah, baby</i>

1:10:28.387 --> 1:10:30.723
<i>You know you got it</i>

1:10:32.016 --> 1:10:36.687
<i>If it makes you feel good</i>

1:10:38.731 --> 1:10:40.607
Francine is amazing!

1:10:40.691 --> 1:10:43.110
Oh, mazel tov to all of you.

1:10:43.193 --> 1:10:44.862
Mazel tov.

1:10:44.945 --> 1:10:49.199
You rocked that <i>shul.</i>
I mean, it was like <i>Shabbos Night Live.</i>

1:10:50.743 --> 1:10:52.286
You made the whole party.

1:10:52.369 --> 1:10:54.747
I think I had more fun
than your family did.

1:10:54.830 --> 1:10:56.832
Why are they looking at me like that?

1:10:56.915 --> 1:10:58.542
Do they not know what's going on here?

1:10:59.293 --> 1:11:01.378
Actually, they don't. Emma, listen.

1:11:01.462 --> 1:11:03.005
You don't know everything.

1:11:03.088 --> 1:11:06.216
- I mean, there's a lot of hard feelings.
- About what?

1:11:07.384 --> 1:11:10.220
Well, they both...
Well, Francine especially.

1:11:10.304 --> 1:11:12.890
...think I wasn't around enough
when they were kids.

1:11:12.973 --> 1:11:16.977
Which was probably true,
but I was working, like, all the time.

1:11:17.061 --> 1:11:20.814
And after Carrie died,
there was a revolving door of nannies.

1:11:20.898 --> 1:11:22.941
And when I was there...

1:11:23.942 --> 1:11:26.779
I had trouble
giving them what they needed.

1:11:27.529 --> 1:11:29.448
I mean, I just was so sad.

1:11:29.531 --> 1:11:31.200
And what do they have against me?

1:11:32.326 --> 1:11:34.119
Well, after she passed away...

1:11:34.870 --> 1:11:37.790
I didn't wanna get involved
with anybody, you know, I couldn't.

1:11:37.873 --> 1:11:39.667
So I dated a lot of younger women.

1:11:41.085 --> 1:11:42.878
So they probably looked at us

1:11:42.961 --> 1:11:44.922
thinking there's something else
going on here.

1:11:45.005 --> 1:11:46.924
I'm really sorry they upset you.

1:11:48.926 --> 1:11:51.679
Ladies and gentlemen, Itzhak Perlman.

1:11:52.179 --> 1:11:53.847
- That's him.
- Does he take requests?

1:11:53.931 --> 1:11:56.225
Itzhak Perlman is a genius.
He doesn't take requests.

1:11:56.308 --> 1:11:59.228
- You still owe me a dance.
- I danced with you. I danced the <i>horah.</i>

1:11:59.311 --> 1:12:01.230
- The <i>horah</i> doesn't count.
- The <i>horah's</i> a dance.

1:12:01.313 --> 1:12:04.775
You run around, they lift you up,
and you sweat in to your good clothes.

1:12:04.858 --> 1:12:06.068
That's a dance.

1:12:06.151 --> 1:12:08.278
Doesn't count.
Come on, Charlie. We're dancing.

1:12:08.362 --> 1:12:09.905
- Come on.
- We're gonna go dance.

1:12:14.660 --> 1:12:16.745
Who dances to a violin concerto?

1:12:16.829 --> 1:12:17.663
We do.

1:12:18.998 --> 1:12:19.832
Okay.

1:12:37.141 --> 1:12:38.267
Oh, there we go.

1:12:38.350 --> 1:12:40.561
Look out. Look out.

1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:00.974
Where have you been?

1:14:01.058 --> 1:14:03.227
- When?
- The last eight hours or so.

1:14:03.310 --> 1:14:05.562
- Here.
- Just so I know, where have I been?

1:14:05.646 --> 1:14:06.897
- Here.
- With you?

1:14:06.980 --> 1:14:09.191
- Yeah.
- That's what I was afraid of.

1:14:09.274 --> 1:14:11.402
Really? Because I thought it's nice.

1:14:11.485 --> 1:14:14.571
Emma, I didn't want for this to happen.

1:14:14.655 --> 1:14:16.949
I don't know what you mean
when you say "this."

1:14:17.032 --> 1:14:21.036
But if the "this" you're referring to
is that "this,"

1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:22.413
it didn't happen.

1:14:22.913 --> 1:14:26.834
I got afraid of the thunder and lightning,
and I snuck in and spooned you.

1:14:26.917 --> 1:14:28.377
That's it. We just spooned.

1:14:28.460 --> 1:14:29.545
That's it?

1:14:30.045 --> 1:14:32.006
- That's it.
- Okay.

1:14:32.089 --> 1:14:34.508
Look, you're an attractive older man,

1:14:34.591 --> 1:14:38.220
but your body would not be
able to handle all these groceries.

1:14:38.303 --> 1:14:41.223
I'll break your back.
It's too heavy for you.

1:14:41.306 --> 1:14:43.892
Can't ride this ride.
The ride is too bumpy.

1:14:43.976 --> 1:14:47.730
You might dislocate your shoulder,
then you die.

1:14:47.813 --> 1:14:48.814
Can't have that.

1:14:50.190 --> 1:14:53.277
Anyways, thank you
for letting me sleep here.

1:14:54.611 --> 1:14:55.821
You're sweet, Charlie.

1:14:55.904 --> 1:14:58.449
And you might want to think about
getting some bigger boxes.

1:14:58.532 --> 1:15:02.161
Because I'm not sure they can handle
your groceries. They're just too little.

1:15:03.245 --> 1:15:06.665
<i>Three, two, one, now!</i>

1:15:07.666 --> 1:15:11.045
I first became incredibly single
when the fetus of my twin brother

1:15:11.128 --> 1:15:13.881
left the womb a month ahead of me,
because...

1:15:13.964 --> 1:15:16.050
Well, he said he'd had enough.

1:15:18.052 --> 1:15:21.597
This continued when I was an infant,
when my mom refused to breastfeed me.

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:25.184
She said, "Let's take things slow,
see where this goes."

1:15:26.727 --> 1:15:30.481
And now, I live in this studio apartment
where I lie awake at night

1:15:30.564 --> 1:15:33.525
and fantasize about having sex
with another person.

1:15:34.735 --> 1:15:37.654
Which would be fun... so I've heard.

1:15:39.073 --> 1:15:42.701
And I think I'd be a pretty good lover.
Find those hard to find spots

1:15:42.785 --> 1:15:44.370
that drive the women wild.

1:15:45.454 --> 1:15:47.081
Because I have Google Maps.

1:15:48.248 --> 1:15:50.542
"In two inches, make a left."

1:15:57.091 --> 1:16:00.844
If you're also incredibly single
like me, why not give me a call?

1:16:01.929 --> 1:16:02.763
If not...

1:16:04.014 --> 1:16:05.474
then the wrath of my god,

1:16:05.974 --> 1:16:10.145
the great god Zoomgali,
who is also incredibly single,

1:16:10.229 --> 1:16:11.772
will come and find you,

1:16:11.855 --> 1:16:14.692
and the sounds will color the sky,

1:16:14.775 --> 1:16:17.611
and he will come after you
and your loved ones,

1:16:17.695 --> 1:16:20.948
and damn you to the fires of hell!

1:16:22.908 --> 1:16:23.909
So call me.

1:16:27.538 --> 1:16:28.747
Killing it.

1:16:30.916 --> 1:16:32.876
Clear. Commercial. Two minutes.

1:16:33.544 --> 1:16:35.379
That was you. That's you, dude.

1:16:36.005 --> 1:16:38.048
- Killed it!
- Thanks.

1:16:38.799 --> 1:16:41.343
Oh, God.
I thought my phone was off. Sorry.

1:16:41.427 --> 1:16:44.346
Hello. Yeah. I'm still at the show.
I can't talk.

1:16:44.430 --> 1:16:46.515
- I found it.
- What did you find?

1:16:46.598 --> 1:16:51.478
That great painting of that old house
that was hanging in the empty space.

1:16:51.979 --> 1:16:54.106
It's beautiful. I rehung it.

1:16:54.189 --> 1:16:55.566
You're still at my house?

1:16:56.233 --> 1:16:58.027
Yeah. But I'm about to go back
to my place.

1:16:58.652 --> 1:17:00.404
- Take it down.
- What?

1:17:00.487 --> 1:17:03.907
- Take it down. I don't wanna see it.
- I'm sorry. I thought you misplaced it.

1:17:03.991 --> 1:17:07.202
Emma, I don't wanna see it,
you understand? I just don't wanna see it.

1:17:07.286 --> 1:17:09.121
- <i>Get rid of it!</i>
- Fine.

1:17:11.832 --> 1:17:14.543
- New girlfriend?
- No. I don't even know.

1:17:15.210 --> 1:17:17.087
Hey, you're right.

1:17:17.671 --> 1:17:19.214
- He's gonna be good.
- Yeah.

1:17:19.798 --> 1:17:23.469
Three, two, one, now!

1:17:23.552 --> 1:17:24.511
In the world of music,

1:17:24.595 --> 1:17:28.557
Lady Gaga announced she is changing
her name to "Lady Gagaga."

1:17:29.099 --> 1:17:31.685
She gave no explanation for her decision.

1:17:31.769 --> 1:17:34.772
According to a poll, Americans
are concerned about a new axis of evil

1:17:34.855 --> 1:17:36.732
that threatens our country's democracy.

1:17:36.815 --> 1:17:38.525
North Korea, ISIS,

1:17:38.609 --> 1:17:40.736
and Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell.

1:17:46.075 --> 1:17:48.577
- Moving on.
- No, no, no.

1:17:48.661 --> 1:17:50.454
Is anyone bothered by this but me?

1:17:50.996 --> 1:17:53.207
Do you hear that it's wrong?

1:17:53.290 --> 1:17:55.501
Your emphasis... You're an emphasis moron.

1:17:57.586 --> 1:17:58.962
What is he doing?

1:17:59.046 --> 1:18:00.756
Everything you say is off.

1:18:00.839 --> 1:18:03.175
It's not "wi fi," it's Wi-Fi.

1:18:04.218 --> 1:18:08.430
It's not "polar ice caps,"
it's polar icecaps.

1:18:08.514 --> 1:18:10.557
You are a comedy kamikaze.

1:18:10.641 --> 1:18:12.518
Oh, wait. A "comma-kaze."

1:18:12.601 --> 1:18:13.977
What the hell?

1:18:14.061 --> 1:18:17.231
Anybody with a correct amount
of chromosomes...

1:18:18.065 --> 1:18:21.902
would know that it's Mitch McConnell,
not "Mitch-McConnell."

1:18:21.985 --> 1:18:24.071
You make it sound like
there a lot of McConnells,

1:18:24.154 --> 1:18:25.114
there's only one.

1:18:25.197 --> 1:18:26.490
There's no Stewie McConnell.

1:18:26.573 --> 1:18:29.243
Is there a Stewie McConnell
in the house? No!

1:18:29.326 --> 1:18:31.620
What the hell is going on?
Should we cut to commercial?

1:18:31.704 --> 1:18:34.790
- Go to commercial?
- This is live. Just stay on it.

1:18:34.873 --> 1:18:37.626
Jesus Christ.
No, I'm sorry. "Jesus, Christ."

1:18:38.627 --> 1:18:41.046
Who, of course, was born in "Bethle-hem."

1:18:41.714 --> 1:18:44.675
I even put in on the cue card,
because I had...

1:18:44.758 --> 1:18:46.844
- You know this?
- I have no idea. No.

1:18:47.386 --> 1:18:48.637
Thank you, Al. Look at this.

1:18:48.721 --> 1:18:52.266
I had written the exact same size
so you would know.

1:18:52.349 --> 1:18:55.102
"Mitch McConnell," not "Mitch-McConnell."

1:18:55.185 --> 1:18:56.729
Mitch McConnell, you see that? Al.

1:18:56.812 --> 1:18:59.148
Camera one, spin around.
Give me Al's reaction.

1:18:59.231 --> 1:19:01.734
Yeah. Tell everybody.
Did I tell you that this would happen?

1:19:01.817 --> 1:19:05.487
- He told me this would happen.
- Everybody. Exhibit A, Al!

1:19:06.196 --> 1:19:08.407
Thank you, Al, you sweet...
Where is he going?

1:19:08.490 --> 1:19:09.908
<i>Get him. Follow him.</i>

1:19:10.409 --> 1:19:11.243
You.

1:19:12.036 --> 1:19:14.413
Look. Look, ma'am, what does that say?

1:19:14.496 --> 1:19:16.206
- "Mitch McConnell."
- Thank you very much.

1:19:16.290 --> 1:19:19.043
- You, you. Stand up. What does this say?
- "Mitch McConnell."

1:19:19.126 --> 1:19:21.378
- Again. I can't hear you.
- "Mitch McConnell."

1:19:21.462 --> 1:19:22.629
We got a winner.

1:19:23.839 --> 1:19:24.757
Dang it.

1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:27.468
Take anything off the top shelf,
goddamn it.

1:19:27.551 --> 1:19:29.970
Everybody, tell me. What does it say?

1:19:30.054 --> 1:19:31.638
- "Mitch McConnell."
- Can't hear you.

1:19:31.722 --> 1:19:33.223
- "Mitch McConnell."
- One more time.

1:19:33.307 --> 1:19:34.767
- "Mitch McConnell."
- Thank you.

1:19:34.850 --> 1:19:36.810
Roger, you're a very talented young guy.

1:19:36.894 --> 1:19:40.147
I have to tell you, I am sick and tired
of writing jokes for you

1:19:40.230 --> 1:19:42.316
and having you abuse them, you dumb turd.

1:19:42.399 --> 1:19:43.317
Oh, boy.

1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:44.401
Dumb turd!

1:19:44.485 --> 1:19:46.904
Everybody. Dumb turd!

1:19:46.987 --> 1:19:49.782
Dumb turd! Dumb turd! Dumb turd!

1:19:49.865 --> 1:19:51.825
Stand up. Dumb turd!

1:19:51.909 --> 1:19:52.910
Dumb turd!

1:19:54.161 --> 1:19:55.913
<i>Dumb turd! Dumb turd!</i>

1:19:55.996 --> 1:19:58.957
Mom, Dad, come here.
Papa Charlie is on television.

1:19:59.041 --> 1:20:00.793
<i>Dumb turd! Dumb turd!</i>

1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:05.506
I say dumb, you say turd! Dumb...

1:20:05.589 --> 1:20:06.632
- Turd.
- Dumb...

1:20:06.715 --> 1:20:07.716
Oh, my God.

1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:09.593
- ...I say turd.
- Dumb...

1:20:09.677 --> 1:20:11.095
I need wide, wide, wide.

1:20:11.178 --> 1:20:12.179
- Dumb...
- Turd!

1:20:12.262 --> 1:20:13.180
- Dumb...
- Turd!

1:20:13.263 --> 1:20:15.182
Dumb turd! Dumb turd!

1:20:15.933 --> 1:20:16.892
Turd!

1:20:16.975 --> 1:20:19.228
Turd! That's it, I'm done. Thank you.

1:20:27.903 --> 1:20:30.322
Would you get those
damn birds out of your hair?

1:20:30.948 --> 1:20:31.782
Larry!

1:20:37.913 --> 1:20:41.083
Camera one.
Back to Roger and reset. Take one!

1:20:41.709 --> 1:20:43.669
- Thank you, "Charlie Burnz."
- No!

1:20:43.752 --> 1:20:45.170
Charlie Burnz.

1:20:46.046 --> 1:20:47.589
Sorry. I'll work on it.

1:20:48.215 --> 1:20:51.051
That's the news of the night...
Of the night.

1:20:51.135 --> 1:20:52.803
The news of the...

1:20:52.886 --> 1:20:56.348
I guess I'm a dumb turd.

1:20:56.432 --> 1:20:57.599
Thank you...

1:20:57.683 --> 1:20:59.018
<i>Good night.</i>

1:21:00.227 --> 1:21:01.687
And we're clear!

1:21:02.187 --> 1:21:03.188
What was that?

1:21:03.272 --> 1:21:04.481
What was that?

1:21:04.565 --> 1:21:07.317
What the hell was that?

1:21:08.360 --> 1:21:10.279
Charlie, what was that?
That was hilarious.

1:21:10.362 --> 1:21:11.905
The schmuck can't get a name right.

1:21:11.989 --> 1:21:13.866
Really inspired idea, Charlie.

1:21:13.949 --> 1:21:17.119
Oh, my God, Charlie.
That is live television.

1:21:17.202 --> 1:21:19.455
Charlie, why didn't you tell me?

1:21:19.538 --> 1:21:23.167
- I haven't told my kids yet.
- I bet they know now. We're live.

1:21:23.667 --> 1:21:25.753
My fault. I should not
have gone back in there.

1:21:25.836 --> 1:21:28.505
It's so stupid.
It's so stupid. It's my fault!

1:21:28.589 --> 1:21:31.216
Stupid? What are you talking about?
Everyone loved it.

1:21:31.300 --> 1:21:34.178
- When did you think of this?
- Comes to me all the time.

1:21:34.261 --> 1:21:36.055
Every second, it doesn't stop.

1:21:36.138 --> 1:21:38.474
That's why it's so good. It was so real.

1:21:38.557 --> 1:21:40.684
Holy shit, you guys.
Twitter is blowing up.

1:21:40.768 --> 1:21:41.852
They love you, Charlie.

1:21:41.935 --> 1:21:44.813
They love the grumpy writer
who can't bear to see his words mangled.

1:21:44.897 --> 1:21:46.190
They think you're funny, man.

1:21:46.273 --> 1:21:49.360
Funny? Funny?
Saying I'll be back in a few minutes

1:21:49.443 --> 1:21:52.363
and never seeing
that person again is funny?

1:21:52.446 --> 1:21:54.198
- Charlie, what...?
- It's not funny!

1:21:54.281 --> 1:21:55.491
How can that be funny?

1:21:55.574 --> 1:21:56.909
<i>Are you Charlie Burnz?</i>

1:21:59.953 --> 1:22:01.163
Charlie Burnz.

1:22:02.039 --> 1:22:03.457
<i>Mr. Burnz?</i>

1:22:04.958 --> 1:22:06.377
I'm Charlie Burnz.

1:22:09.755 --> 1:22:11.382
Don't tell me that something's wrong.

1:22:13.467 --> 1:22:14.301
<i>Charlie?</i>

1:22:15.886 --> 1:22:16.720
Charlie?

1:22:19.890 --> 1:22:23.227
Nothing's wrong. It's okay.
You're all right, Charlie.

1:22:24.353 --> 1:22:26.397
Hey, come back to my office.

1:22:27.106 --> 1:22:29.358
Lie down for a little bit. Yeah?

1:22:30.234 --> 1:22:31.735
I'm so tired.

1:22:31.819 --> 1:22:33.404
It's okay. It's okay.

1:22:34.405 --> 1:22:35.698
Come on.

1:22:35.781 --> 1:22:37.991
- I'm really tired.
- It's all right. It's all right.

1:22:40.285 --> 1:22:43.038
- Until tonight, he's been fine.
- Yeah.

1:22:43.122 --> 1:22:46.000
Sometimes he's just great.
You'd never know he had a problem.

1:22:47.418 --> 1:22:50.546
And then it would just hit him,
but nothing like this.

1:22:50.629 --> 1:22:51.672
I had no idea.

1:22:52.673 --> 1:22:54.717
- It's our secret.
- Our?

1:22:55.968 --> 1:22:57.928
- Nobody else knows?
- No.

1:22:58.012 --> 1:23:01.432
Well, we have a problem.
Social media is blowing up. They love it.

1:23:01.515 --> 1:23:03.517
Everybody is asking, "Who is this guy?"

1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:05.102
They want him back next week.

1:23:05.185 --> 1:23:06.603
- I know it's gone viral.
- Yeah.

1:23:06.687 --> 1:23:09.106
You know, I'm very nervous about what...

1:23:09.189 --> 1:23:11.775
We need to post something right away.

1:23:11.859 --> 1:23:13.360
Twitter, Instagram.

1:23:13.444 --> 1:23:15.029
Sorry to interrupt. I just overheard.

1:23:15.112 --> 1:23:17.990
- Darrell, come on.
- Let me do it, please.

1:23:18.073 --> 1:23:19.199
I know what to say.

1:23:21.368 --> 1:23:22.828
Okay. Good.

1:23:23.495 --> 1:23:25.831
- I have to run it by the network.
- Okay.

1:23:26.707 --> 1:23:28.959
This is Charlie's friend Emma.

1:23:29.668 --> 1:23:31.211
He's Darrell, he works with Charlie.

1:23:31.879 --> 1:23:33.714
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1:23:34.340 --> 1:23:35.341
I'll get started.

1:23:37.968 --> 1:23:38.802
What a night.

1:23:40.637 --> 1:23:43.015
Okay, Charlie. There's the car.
Go ahead and get in.

1:23:43.098 --> 1:23:43.932
Okay.

1:23:47.061 --> 1:23:48.771
- Thanks.
- Hey, Charlie.

1:23:48.854 --> 1:23:49.688
Yeah?

1:23:49.772 --> 1:23:52.649
I just wanted to say good night
and make sure you're okay.

1:23:53.150 --> 1:23:54.651
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:23:54.735 --> 1:23:55.569
Hey, I...

1:23:56.278 --> 1:23:57.237
I posted that:

1:23:58.405 --> 1:24:01.325
"Tonight, Charlie Burnz
showed why he's a comedy legend

1:24:01.408 --> 1:24:05.954
when he gave a hilarious one-time only
performance as a disgruntled writer.

1:24:06.038 --> 1:24:07.581
Thank you, Charlie.

1:24:07.665 --> 1:24:09.667
The crew and cast of <i>This Just In.</i>

1:24:09.750 --> 1:24:11.502
Hashtag "dumb turd."

1:24:12.961 --> 1:24:15.589
And I put the "you" in all caps
so it's the wrong inflection.

1:24:16.715 --> 1:24:17.675
Thanks, kid.

1:24:18.300 --> 1:24:19.677
Good night, Charlie.

1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:24.390
You know, Darrell here is gonna be
a terrific writer someday.

1:24:25.766 --> 1:24:26.934
I don't know.

1:24:27.017 --> 1:24:28.018
I do.

1:24:30.020 --> 1:24:30.979
I'll see you, kid.

1:24:33.482 --> 1:24:35.776
This is a scan of your brain in February.

1:24:36.985 --> 1:24:39.154
And this is the one we just took.

1:24:43.909 --> 1:24:45.411
They look the same to me.

1:24:46.453 --> 1:24:48.163
Yes, but your symptoms are changing.

1:24:51.166 --> 1:24:53.252
If I'm right, you may have
a form of dementia

1:24:53.335 --> 1:24:55.379
called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

1:24:58.382 --> 1:25:00.426
What do you mean if you're right?

1:25:05.931 --> 1:25:09.601
Only way to get
a definitive diagnosis of CJD is...

1:25:10.686 --> 1:25:12.187
post-mortem autopsy.

1:25:13.272 --> 1:25:14.106
Well...

1:25:15.774 --> 1:25:17.067
why don't we do that now?

1:25:17.151 --> 1:25:20.154
I mean, I have a lunch
but I could cancel that.

1:25:21.739 --> 1:25:23.490
What happens next?

1:25:23.574 --> 1:25:26.160
There are other medications
than the ones you're on now...

1:25:27.202 --> 1:25:30.205
that could slow this down a bit,

1:25:30.289 --> 1:25:32.291
but before too long.

1:25:38.047 --> 1:25:39.798
Before too long is how long?

1:25:42.217 --> 1:25:43.385
A year, maybe.

1:25:47.931 --> 1:25:50.309
You probably wanna start
thinking about a caregiver.

1:25:53.228 --> 1:25:54.480
A nurse?

1:25:54.563 --> 1:25:56.482
Yes, or your family.

1:25:57.358 --> 1:25:59.193
- Your son and daughter.
- Well...

1:26:00.152 --> 1:26:01.278
that's not happening.

1:26:02.321 --> 1:26:06.200
In times like this,
you should be surrounded by loved ones,

1:26:06.283 --> 1:26:09.203
or professionals
who are trained to care for you.

1:26:15.501 --> 1:26:17.795
I'll do it. I'll take care of Charlie.

1:26:17.878 --> 1:26:19.797
No, you can't. You're going away.

1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:21.340
My plans have changed.

1:26:21.423 --> 1:26:23.467
No. No, they haven't changed.

1:26:23.550 --> 1:26:25.969
She's in a band and they're supposed
to go on tour.

1:26:26.053 --> 1:26:28.055
- Nah, I don't need to do that.
- No. Yes, you do.

1:26:28.138 --> 1:26:29.640
She does need to do that.

1:26:31.392 --> 1:26:33.102
May I ask what your relationship is?

1:26:33.769 --> 1:26:35.104
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1:26:35.187 --> 1:26:37.272
How long have you known each other?

1:26:37.356 --> 1:26:39.900
I'm guessing about six months or so.

1:26:39.983 --> 1:26:41.652
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend?

1:26:44.780 --> 1:26:45.614
Are we?

1:26:46.573 --> 1:26:48.993
How would you define
boyfriend and girlfriend?

1:26:49.076 --> 1:26:51.787
Well, are you having sexual relations?

1:26:51.870 --> 1:26:53.664
- We spooned.
- We spooned.

1:26:56.291 --> 1:26:57.126
Charlie...

1:26:58.127 --> 1:26:59.461
what about your kids?

1:27:00.379 --> 1:27:02.631
I honestly don't know
if they've ever spooned.

1:27:02.715 --> 1:27:03.799
Charlie.

1:27:04.633 --> 1:27:07.594
- This is no time for jokes.
- Yes, it is.

1:27:08.345 --> 1:27:10.597
It's the perfect time for jokes,
goddamn it.

1:27:10.681 --> 1:27:13.642
Don't try to take away my sense of humor.
I'd rather die right now.

1:27:16.061 --> 1:27:18.564
Boy, this God...
This God is a real jokester, isn't he?

1:27:18.647 --> 1:27:20.357
What a really funny God.

1:27:20.441 --> 1:27:23.569
"Hey, live your whole life
and you won't remember any of it."

1:27:24.820 --> 1:27:25.779
Fuck you!

1:27:27.156 --> 1:27:28.907
- Damn it.
- It's gonna be okay.

1:27:28.991 --> 1:27:31.035
How can this be okay?

1:27:31.118 --> 1:27:32.661
How can this be okay?

1:27:37.541 --> 1:27:39.209
My kids don't know anything.

1:27:42.046 --> 1:27:43.505
I'll tell them at the right time.

1:27:44.757 --> 1:27:45.841
Charlie.

1:27:48.052 --> 1:27:49.428
This is the right time.

1:27:52.097 --> 1:27:53.766
You can't be alone anymore.

1:27:59.646 --> 1:28:01.482
I'll take care of him till I can't.

1:28:04.985 --> 1:28:06.570
I'll write you some prescriptions.

1:28:08.655 --> 1:28:10.574
I'll let the two of you be alone a bit.

1:28:21.752 --> 1:28:22.878
What is wrong with you?

1:28:22.961 --> 1:28:25.422
- What? There's nothing wrong with me.
- You're not staying.

1:28:25.506 --> 1:28:26.882
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1:28:26.965 --> 1:28:30.052
You heard what the doc said,
it's over, okay?

1:28:30.135 --> 1:28:32.554
That's it. Please, leave me alone!

1:28:32.638 --> 1:28:34.765
- Charlie.
- Don't "Charlie" me!

1:28:36.016 --> 1:28:36.850
You have a life!

1:28:36.934 --> 1:28:38.936
You have your music, so run.

1:28:39.019 --> 1:28:42.147
Run for the hills, kid.
It's over. I'm telling you, it's over.

1:28:42.231 --> 1:28:45.651
Please, I just wanna be alone!

1:28:45.734 --> 1:28:48.320
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I don't want you to stay!

1:28:49.196 --> 1:28:52.616
You hear me? What are you staying for?

1:28:53.575 --> 1:28:56.912
What's here?
What's gonna be left? Nothing!

1:28:56.996 --> 1:28:58.622
That's not true, Charlie.

1:29:00.708 --> 1:29:02.626
I'm lost. I'm...

1:29:03.961 --> 1:29:06.714
Help, help, help. I'm lost.

1:29:07.756 --> 1:29:10.259
I'm so... I'm so lost.

1:29:11.593 --> 1:29:13.637
I'm sorry, pal. But I'm in.

1:29:14.805 --> 1:29:16.724
You wanna be with a stranger?

1:29:19.476 --> 1:29:21.979
Pretty soon everyone's
gonna be a stranger.

1:29:22.062 --> 1:29:22.980
Not me.

1:29:24.106 --> 1:29:25.566
I'm not gonna leave you.

1:29:28.318 --> 1:29:29.153
Thank you.

1:29:50.549 --> 1:29:51.425
Hi.

1:29:52.676 --> 1:29:54.303
Whose room did this used to be?

1:29:54.386 --> 1:29:55.721
Francine's.

1:29:55.804 --> 1:29:57.431
That explains the chill.

1:29:58.015 --> 1:29:59.183
Something wrong?

1:29:59.266 --> 1:30:00.434
I can't sleep.

1:30:00.517 --> 1:30:01.518
What's up?

1:30:02.561 --> 1:30:05.147
- I wrote something.
- That's good.

1:30:05.230 --> 1:30:07.399
- I wanna read it to you.
- Okay.

1:30:07.483 --> 1:30:08.650
This is my journal.

1:30:09.151 --> 1:30:11.779
I've been writing stuff
for the book in it

1:30:11.862 --> 1:30:13.947
because typing
has become a problem for me.

1:30:14.031 --> 1:30:15.407
I know.

1:30:17.868 --> 1:30:19.328
The book is called <i>For Carrie.</i>

1:30:19.953 --> 1:30:21.330
This is the dedication.

1:30:21.413 --> 1:30:24.291
A writer always dedicates the book
to somebody he loves...

1:30:24.375 --> 1:30:26.126
- I know what it means.
- Okay.

1:30:29.213 --> 1:30:30.673
"To Emma Payge.

1:30:32.049 --> 1:30:35.844
Thank you for taking my truth
and making it more interesting.

1:30:36.679 --> 1:30:39.181
I kind of love you. CB."

1:30:39.973 --> 1:30:42.142
I kind of love you too, old man.

1:30:43.435 --> 1:30:44.269
Really?

1:30:44.895 --> 1:30:46.397
Yeah. Big time.

1:30:48.232 --> 1:30:49.316
Didn't see that coming.

1:30:51.402 --> 1:30:52.695
You make me smile.

1:30:54.238 --> 1:30:55.656
Good night.

1:30:55.739 --> 1:30:56.782
Good night.

1:31:04.039 --> 1:31:04.873
Hey, Emma.

1:31:07.710 --> 1:31:09.586
I'm grateful to you that you're here.

1:31:10.629 --> 1:31:13.173
I wanna have fun. I wanna laugh.

1:31:13.257 --> 1:31:14.717
I want to not be scared.

1:31:15.342 --> 1:31:18.178
And I wanna write the book,
and I wanna do all of that with you.

1:31:18.262 --> 1:31:19.888
But you have to promise me something.

1:31:21.140 --> 1:31:22.307
When it's time...

1:31:23.976 --> 1:31:25.769
you go back out and sing.

1:31:25.853 --> 1:31:27.980
You're an artist,
and that's what you should do.

1:31:28.063 --> 1:31:29.231
Please, promise me.

1:31:30.733 --> 1:31:31.567
I promise.

1:31:32.109 --> 1:31:32.943
Good.

1:31:34.945 --> 1:31:37.031
I'm a bargain for 22 bucks,
don't you think?

1:31:37.656 --> 1:31:38.824
Hell, yeah.

1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:42.578
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:32:10.606 --> 1:32:14.068
I must've dozed off.
These new meds are making me very sleepy.

1:32:14.151 --> 1:32:16.737
I haven't taken a nap
since the Carter administration.

1:32:18.864 --> 1:32:20.491
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.

1:32:21.617 --> 1:32:22.743
Let me see.

1:32:24.203 --> 1:32:25.037
The...

1:32:25.788 --> 1:32:28.999
- It's that...
- Emma, I know what it is.

1:32:30.209 --> 1:32:33.962
I know you said get rid of it,
but it's just so beautiful.

1:32:34.046 --> 1:32:34.880
Give it to me.

1:32:47.685 --> 1:32:49.812
Carrie painted this. Yeah.

1:32:50.896 --> 1:32:55.150
See, she put her name in the bushes.
See there? In the trees.

1:32:58.737 --> 1:33:00.406
This is Lake Charlie.

1:33:00.489 --> 1:33:02.491
Lake Charlie. Where's that?

1:33:02.574 --> 1:33:06.203
That's about two hours
north of the city. Yeah.

1:33:07.997 --> 1:33:10.165
Carrie gave me a lake for my birthday.

1:33:10.249 --> 1:33:11.333
A lake?

1:33:11.417 --> 1:33:14.044
Yeah. It was actually a pond.

1:33:14.128 --> 1:33:18.048
But Pond Charlie
didn't sound as good as Lake Charlie.

1:33:18.132 --> 1:33:19.008
Wait.

1:33:19.675 --> 1:33:20.676
What?

1:33:21.885 --> 1:33:24.847
Tell me all about Lake Charlie.

1:33:26.306 --> 1:33:27.433
Okay.

1:33:29.184 --> 1:33:30.769
It's my 40th birthday.

1:33:30.853 --> 1:33:33.355
Happy birthday, Charlie Burnz.

1:33:33.439 --> 1:33:34.857
Happy birthday, Charlie.

1:33:35.441 --> 1:33:38.277
<i>We had a party outside in the garden.</i>

1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:39.987
<i>And after everybody was gone...</i>

1:33:40.696 --> 1:33:43.449
<i>Carrie shows me this photograph
of this woodsy area</i>

1:33:43.532 --> 1:33:44.908
<i>with this beautiful lake on it.</i>

1:33:44.992 --> 1:33:48.245
Happy birthday, Charlie Burnz.
This is for you.

1:33:48.746 --> 1:33:51.248
For me? What is this?
What am I looking at?

1:33:52.207 --> 1:33:54.376
It's called Lake Charlie.

1:33:54.460 --> 1:33:55.627
Lake Charlie?

1:33:55.711 --> 1:33:58.047
<i>She was always trying to get me
to stop working.</i>

1:33:58.130 --> 1:34:01.884
And just be alone with her and do nothing.

1:34:01.967 --> 1:34:06.055
And honestly the thought of doing nothing
terrified me, you know?

1:34:07.973 --> 1:34:10.434
But I loved her so much
and it meant so much to her

1:34:10.517 --> 1:34:15.064
that we'd go up there, you know,
and camp out, like, in a tent.

1:34:15.147 --> 1:34:16.732
Can you imagine me in a tent?

1:34:16.815 --> 1:34:21.320
<i>I mean, to me, the great outdoors
would be a lot better if it was indoors.</i>

1:34:21.403 --> 1:34:23.113
Good morning!

1:34:27.368 --> 1:34:31.205
That smells good.
Smells better than me.

1:34:34.249 --> 1:34:36.168
Wow... Whoa! Look what you did.

1:34:40.756 --> 1:34:42.174
- Hey, Charlie?
- Yeah?

1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:44.635
- You know what I think?
- What?

1:34:45.386 --> 1:34:48.555
- I think we need a house.
- A house?

1:34:48.639 --> 1:34:49.640
Yeah.

1:34:50.224 --> 1:34:51.642
The kids will love it up here.

1:34:52.810 --> 1:34:55.437
- Kids?
- Didn't I tell you?

1:34:57.356 --> 1:34:59.692
And that's how she told me
she was pregnant with Rex.

1:35:01.193 --> 1:35:03.529
So she went looking for a house.

1:35:03.612 --> 1:35:05.698
Wait, didn't you guys build a house?

1:35:05.781 --> 1:35:07.616
Oh, no, that's way too easy for Carrie.

1:35:07.700 --> 1:35:10.285
She scoured the countryside
then she found this little house,

1:35:10.369 --> 1:35:12.621
she bought it and lifted it up,

1:35:12.705 --> 1:35:15.582
put it on a flatbed truck
and she drove it to Lake Charlie.

1:35:15.666 --> 1:35:18.377
Got a house, Charlie Burnz!

1:35:20.421 --> 1:35:21.755
Thank you.

1:35:21.839 --> 1:35:23.924
<i>So we put in a new foundation,</i>

1:35:24.008 --> 1:35:26.510
<i>plopped the house down on it,
renovated it,</i>

1:35:26.593 --> 1:35:29.096
<i>painted it up,
made it a little bit bigger.</i>

1:35:29.179 --> 1:35:30.597
<i>It was our happy place.</i>

1:35:30.681 --> 1:35:33.892
Dad, come on! Let's go play.
Daddy, come on!

1:35:33.976 --> 1:35:35.019
<i>She was right.</i>

1:35:35.102 --> 1:35:37.229
Daddy, come on. Are you playing or not?

1:35:37.312 --> 1:35:38.856
The kids loved it.

1:35:40.065 --> 1:35:42.901
Now I know why
you didn't wanna hang the picture.

1:35:44.653 --> 1:35:45.779
No, you don't.

1:35:48.615 --> 1:35:50.743
I'm tired. I can't talk anymore.

1:35:50.826 --> 1:35:54.121
Come on, Charlie. Please?
Don't take this with you.

1:35:54.997 --> 1:35:56.790
I'm not going anywhere yet.

1:36:00.669 --> 1:36:05.049
Okay. My first Broadway play,
<i>It's My Time,</i>

1:36:05.132 --> 1:36:06.592
<i>opened up at the Belasco Theatre.</i>

1:36:07.051 --> 1:36:10.637
<i>Reviews were terrific, business was great,
but that wasn't enough for me.</i>

1:36:10.721 --> 1:36:12.806
<i>The star was an actor named Jerry Orbach,</i>

1:36:12.890 --> 1:36:15.392
<i>and there was this one speech
late in the second act.</i>

1:36:15.476 --> 1:36:18.354
<i>It never landed right. It drove me crazy.</i>

1:36:18.437 --> 1:36:20.898
All I wanted was one show
that was just perfect.

1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:29.698
Things were tense...

1:36:30.949 --> 1:36:32.409
between the two of us.

1:36:33.369 --> 1:36:34.995
<i>I'd been working so much.</i>

1:36:35.079 --> 1:36:36.163
What are we doing?

1:36:36.246 --> 1:36:39.833
<i>I'd been on the road for four months
with the play before it came to Broadway.</i>

1:36:39.917 --> 1:36:42.628
<i>And everybody was looking forward
to spending some time together</i>

1:36:42.711 --> 1:36:45.005
<i>at Lake Charlie, and what was I doing?</i>

1:36:45.089 --> 1:36:47.800
<i>I was rewriting a play
that was already a hit.</i>

1:36:47.883 --> 1:36:50.803
Charlie, we have to go right now.

1:36:51.303 --> 1:36:53.722
Jefferson will be awful.
I don't like driving in the dark.

1:36:53.806 --> 1:36:56.684
My mom's got the kids there waiting.
We should have left an hour ago.

1:36:56.767 --> 1:36:59.311
I had to rewrite a speech for Jerry.
It wasn't landing right.

1:36:59.395 --> 1:37:01.355
Great. Okay. That's just great.

1:37:01.438 --> 1:37:03.774
He's reading it.
I wanna make sure it's okay with him.

1:37:03.857 --> 1:37:07.861
You wanna make sure it's okay with him?
With him? How about with me?

1:37:07.945 --> 1:37:10.698
How about your kids
who you haven't seen for months?

1:37:10.781 --> 1:37:12.366
You promised me. You promised us.

1:37:12.449 --> 1:37:15.619
Stop yelling. Five minutes,
I promise. I'll be right in and right out.

1:37:15.703 --> 1:37:18.038
- The kids are waiting.
- I understand. I'll be right out.

1:37:18.122 --> 1:37:20.290
The people are in line,
the show goes up in an hour.

1:37:20.374 --> 1:37:22.126
- Five minutes?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:37:22.209 --> 1:37:24.962
I know you're upset,
but I hate when you get like this.

1:37:25.045 --> 1:37:28.173
If you're not back in five minutes,
I'm leaving without you.

1:37:28.257 --> 1:37:32.136
I heard you, okay? I heard you.
Goddamn it.

1:37:36.306 --> 1:37:40.144
<i>It took 15 minutes.
When I came out she was gone.</i>

1:37:40.978 --> 1:37:46.316
<i>I was angry. So I watched the show,
that damn speech still didn't land right.</i>

1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:49.278
<i>I had a couple of drinks with Jerry
and then I came back here...</i>

1:37:50.988 --> 1:37:53.949
And the next thing I remember
is flashing lights.

1:37:55.117 --> 1:38:00.789
And a policeman in the doorway
asking me my name over and over again.

1:38:02.458 --> 1:38:05.044
And I'm thinking if I don't answer him,

1:38:05.127 --> 1:38:08.380
then maybe what he's about
to tell me didn't happen.

1:38:16.597 --> 1:38:20.768
He told me Carrie was driving
on this dark road right near the house.

1:38:20.851 --> 1:38:22.853
She came to this fork in the road,

1:38:24.104 --> 1:38:27.900
and some kid loaded on pills
driving a Jeep ran the stop sign.

1:38:30.486 --> 1:38:31.945
And he hit her head-on.

1:38:33.614 --> 1:38:34.907
She died instantly.

1:38:36.075 --> 1:38:37.868
Kid walked away without a scratch.

1:38:39.870 --> 1:38:42.748
The last time I saw that beautiful face
she was mad at me.

1:38:45.501 --> 1:38:48.379
That's why I can't look
at that picture anymore.

1:38:49.171 --> 1:38:52.341
It makes me remember
the one thing I want to forget.

1:39:00.599 --> 1:39:01.558
I'm sorry.

1:39:06.814 --> 1:39:07.940
Me too.

1:39:17.032 --> 1:39:20.244
- You need anything from the store?
- Wonton soup.

1:39:20.327 --> 1:39:22.788
I'd like to shampoo my hair.
It's getting a little greasy...

1:39:22.871 --> 1:39:25.124
- Charlie.
- What?

1:39:26.542 --> 1:39:30.379
I'm just kidding. I'm okay.
I promise. Thanks.

1:39:30.462 --> 1:39:31.422
Good.

1:39:31.505 --> 1:39:35.175
Hey, I was thinking, you know
what we can do some day? It could be fun.

1:39:35.718 --> 1:39:39.972
Ever been to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum?
You ever been there?

1:39:40.055 --> 1:39:42.599
It's a lot of fun.
It's pretty amazing what they do.

1:39:48.272 --> 1:39:50.774
Okay. Sure.

1:40:09.376 --> 1:40:14.298
You're back already?
Okay. Coming, coming, coming.

1:40:17.926 --> 1:40:19.678
- Hi!
- Hi.

1:40:19.762 --> 1:40:22.890
Come on in. Come on in.
This is a surprise.

1:40:22.973 --> 1:40:26.268
What's the matter?
You look very upset. What's wrong?

1:40:26.352 --> 1:40:28.103
I had a fight with my mom.

1:40:28.187 --> 1:40:29.897
She said you were
drunk and embarrassing.

1:40:29.980 --> 1:40:32.483
I said you could never be.
You were funny on the show.

1:40:32.566 --> 1:40:35.110
Why did she keep you away from me?
She said something awful.

1:40:35.194 --> 1:40:37.529
- Does she know where you are?
- She thinks I'm at school.

1:40:37.613 --> 1:40:39.156
- How did you get here?
- Uber.

1:40:39.239 --> 1:40:42.159
- We should tell her you're here.
- No! She'll be so mad at me.

1:40:42.242 --> 1:40:45.704
- But Lindsay...
- Please. I just have to know if it's true.

1:40:45.788 --> 1:40:47.289
Is what true?

1:40:49.249 --> 1:40:52.127
She said it was because of you
that I don't have a grandma.

1:40:52.920 --> 1:40:54.380
She said that to you?

1:40:54.463 --> 1:40:57.216
I overheard her
on the phone with Uncle Rex.

1:40:59.468 --> 1:41:00.844
No, Lindsay, no.

1:41:01.595 --> 1:41:02.846
Okay.

1:41:06.975 --> 1:41:08.852
Lindsay never made it to school, Rex.

1:41:08.936 --> 1:41:11.897
She used my Uber account
and guess where she took it to.

1:41:13.399 --> 1:41:18.737
I got your wonton soup but the chef said
that you need to use extra conditioner...

1:41:19.780 --> 1:41:21.073
Charlie!

1:41:22.199 --> 1:41:26.120
I got some short ribs, it'll be so good.

1:41:27.371 --> 1:41:28.247
Charlie?

1:41:29.707 --> 1:41:32.292
Charlie? Charlie!

1:41:34.294 --> 1:41:38.424
Where are you, old man?
Charlie, stop playing.

1:41:38.507 --> 1:41:40.884
Hey. Where is she?

1:41:40.968 --> 1:41:44.138
- How'd you get in here?
- We grew up here. Where is she?

1:41:44.221 --> 1:41:45.389
- Who?
- My daughter Lindsay.

1:41:45.472 --> 1:41:46.849
And our father. Where's our dad?

1:41:46.932 --> 1:41:48.183
- Lindsay!
- Dad!

1:41:48.267 --> 1:41:51.061
Nobody's here. I just got home myself.

1:41:51.145 --> 1:41:52.896
- Home?
- Do you live here?

1:41:52.980 --> 1:41:55.899
- I moved in a few days ago.
- Oh, lovely.

1:41:55.983 --> 1:41:58.068
- Your dad needs me right now.
- I bet he does.

1:41:59.111 --> 1:42:01.405
You might want
to rethink your attitude, Francine.

1:42:01.989 --> 1:42:04.283
What is this? What is all this about?

1:42:04.783 --> 1:42:06.994
Research for a project he's working on.

1:42:07.077 --> 1:42:09.872
- With our names under the pictures?
- He doesn't know who we are?

1:42:09.955 --> 1:42:11.040
Not all the time.

1:42:12.458 --> 1:42:13.959
Your father's sick.

1:42:14.710 --> 1:42:17.796
He has a form of dementia.
And it's getting worse.

1:42:18.964 --> 1:42:20.549
He can't be alone anymore.

1:42:21.425 --> 1:42:23.927
That's why I moved in, Francine.

1:42:24.011 --> 1:42:28.599
I'm his friend. He's writing a book about
your family and I'm helping him finish it.

1:42:29.725 --> 1:42:31.977
- I can't believe this.
- We had no idea.

1:42:32.061 --> 1:42:34.104
Because you're too busy
being pissed at him.

1:42:35.064 --> 1:42:38.317
Pretty soon before you know it,
he's not gonna know who you are.

1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:39.818
But you'll remember him.

1:42:40.444 --> 1:42:44.573
He's done a very good job at beating
himself up without you guys piling on.

1:42:44.656 --> 1:42:46.492
You were very happy once.

1:42:46.575 --> 1:42:49.203
It can happen again if you let it.

1:42:50.329 --> 1:42:53.374
- How do we find them?
- I put a GPS on his phone.

1:42:53.457 --> 1:42:55.292
Okay. Let me see.

1:42:59.088 --> 1:43:02.132
- No. No, no, no.
- It's here. It's here.

1:43:03.217 --> 1:43:05.177
Where the hell are they?

1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:07.721
If she's still using my Uber account,
we can find them.

1:43:31.996 --> 1:43:33.372
I cannot believe this.

1:43:33.455 --> 1:43:36.625
- Hey. What's wrong?
- Longer trip than I thought.

1:43:36.709 --> 1:43:39.211
You give five star. I accept nothing less.

1:43:39.294 --> 1:43:40.671
Is this the best way to go?

1:43:42.381 --> 1:43:43.966
This is all my fault.

1:43:44.049 --> 1:43:46.260
She overheard what I said to you.
We got in a fight...

1:43:46.343 --> 1:43:49.471
- She heard that?
- Yes. I know. I'm sorry, okay?

1:43:49.555 --> 1:43:53.183
- What if he does something crazy?
- What's he gonna do, Francine?

1:43:53.267 --> 1:43:57.855
- What's gonna happen?
- He loves Lindsay. Nothing will happen.

1:43:57.938 --> 1:43:59.440
How can you be so sure?

1:44:00.107 --> 1:44:01.650
I know him.

1:44:09.616 --> 1:44:13.287
Papa! Where are you going? Come back!

1:44:17.458 --> 1:44:21.754
- Please stop!
- Hey, what about my five stars?!

1:44:25.007 --> 1:44:28.135
Oh, God! Lindsay, honey, are you okay?

1:44:28.218 --> 1:44:29.887
Papa Charlie ran away!

1:44:29.970 --> 1:44:32.848
He told the driver to pull over,
jumped out of the car and ran.

1:44:32.931 --> 1:44:34.725
I'm scared. I'm in the woods.

1:44:34.808 --> 1:44:37.644
Lindsay, don't worry. Look around.
Can you see anything?

1:44:37.728 --> 1:44:38.854
I can see the road.

1:44:38.937 --> 1:44:41.774
Go there. Go to the road.
We're gonna find you.

1:44:49.198 --> 1:44:51.075
Mom! Mom!

1:44:54.036 --> 1:44:55.287
Lindsay!

1:44:56.830 --> 1:44:58.040
Sweetheart.

1:45:01.168 --> 1:45:02.670
Come on. Back in the car.

1:45:02.753 --> 1:45:07.091
- Oh, my God. Rex.
- I know. Let's find him.

1:45:16.850 --> 1:45:18.018
Dad?

1:45:18.602 --> 1:45:19.937
- Papa Charlie?
- Dad?

1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:22.022
- Charlie?
- Papa Charlie?

1:45:22.106 --> 1:45:25.693
No, Dad. No. Please, Dad. Dad?

1:45:25.776 --> 1:45:27.444
- Charlie?
- Dad?

1:45:29.697 --> 1:45:31.240
Charlie!

1:45:31.323 --> 1:45:32.408
Papa Charlie!

1:45:32.491 --> 1:45:34.326
Charlie!

1:45:35.995 --> 1:45:39.832
- Dad! Dad!
- Charlie!

1:45:39.915 --> 1:45:42.584
- Papa Charlie!
- Dad!

1:45:42.668 --> 1:45:45.254
- Charlie!
- Dad!

1:45:45.337 --> 1:45:47.840
Papa Charlie, where are you?

1:45:53.387 --> 1:45:54.513
Charlie!

1:45:56.974 --> 1:45:58.142
Charlie.

1:46:02.521 --> 1:46:03.856
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:46:08.068 --> 1:46:11.864
- Hey. You're okay?
- My feet are wet.

1:46:11.947 --> 1:46:13.198
Mine are too.

1:46:14.533 --> 1:46:16.160
Are you okay? You look so upset.

1:46:16.243 --> 1:46:18.078
I'm just happy to see you.

1:46:18.162 --> 1:46:19.455
Dad.

1:46:22.374 --> 1:46:23.834
What are you doing here?

1:46:25.044 --> 1:46:26.253
Hi.

1:46:27.421 --> 1:46:31.592
I wanted to show Lindsay Lake Charlie.

1:46:32.426 --> 1:46:34.136
This is our happy place.

1:46:35.554 --> 1:46:37.681
See, on sunsets we stand right here.

1:46:38.307 --> 1:46:44.438
And we'd watch the sun go down there
and "Bye-bye sun. Bye-bye sun."

1:46:44.521 --> 1:46:45.647
Somebody would say that.

1:46:45.731 --> 1:46:47.274
That was me, Dad.

1:46:48.567 --> 1:46:50.819
- I said that.
- Yeah.

1:46:57.076 --> 1:46:59.286
- I'm sorry about your mother.
- No.

1:46:59.370 --> 1:47:02.665
- Dad, you don't have to.
- No, I have to. I have to, Rex.

1:47:03.165 --> 1:47:05.542
Let me finish
because I'm running out of words.

1:47:09.963 --> 1:47:12.341
Francine, I was not
the reason your mom died.

1:47:14.301 --> 1:47:17.054
That kid who ran the stop sign
was the reason your mom died.

1:47:18.180 --> 1:47:21.517
And I adored her so much.
I loved your mother so much.

1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:23.977
And she died mad at me.

1:47:26.271 --> 1:47:28.691
I can't leave here
knowing that you're mad at me too.

1:47:31.026 --> 1:47:36.156
I can't undo it. I can't undo it.
There's no rewrites this time.

1:47:36.240 --> 1:47:39.702
Come on. Relax. Relax your hands.

1:47:40.869 --> 1:47:42.830
No more fists. Relax your hands.

1:47:47.793 --> 1:47:51.338
Dad. Why didn't you tell us?

1:47:53.841 --> 1:47:56.719
Because I didn't know how.

1:47:59.096 --> 1:48:00.055
And I was scared.

1:48:01.432 --> 1:48:02.349
Of what?

1:48:03.225 --> 1:48:05.978
That maybe you wouldn't care.

1:48:06.061 --> 1:48:07.354
Oh, Dad.

1:48:10.315 --> 1:48:11.775
Forgive me. Please.

1:48:12.943 --> 1:48:15.237
Forgive me so I could forgive myself.

1:48:15.320 --> 1:48:18.073
Because the sight of
your angry eyes keeps me up at night

1:48:18.157 --> 1:48:21.243
and gives me the sweats,
and there's no more time for that.

1:48:21.327 --> 1:48:23.912
There's no more time. I'm here today.

1:48:23.996 --> 1:48:26.123
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

1:48:26.206 --> 1:48:30.919
Franny, it's okay. It's okay.
I understand. I understand.

1:48:31.462 --> 1:48:35.215
- I love you, Pop.
- Is there room for me?

1:48:35.299 --> 1:48:37.468
- Come here, sweetie.
- I love you too, you know?

1:48:40.471 --> 1:48:42.598
Emma. Emma. Come here.

1:48:47.853 --> 1:48:50.397
Oh, God. What a long time between hugs.

1:49:00.866 --> 1:49:04.161
Mom was always inventing days
for the kids.

1:49:04.244 --> 1:49:06.330
Kids loved "Backwards Day" the best.

1:49:06.413 --> 1:49:08.791
We'd have dinner for breakfast
and breakfast for dinner.

1:49:08.874 --> 1:49:10.793
No, Pop. It was "Upside-down Day."

1:49:10.876 --> 1:49:14.046
God, I love that.
We would have cake for breakfast.

1:49:14.129 --> 1:49:15.464
- Can we do that?
- Yeah.

1:49:15.547 --> 1:49:17.633
Will you do it with us,
Papa Charlie and Emma?

1:49:17.716 --> 1:49:21.637
- Absolutely.
- Anything for you. Is it upside-down day?

1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:23.222
Yeah. Upside-down day.

1:49:24.014 --> 1:49:25.933
I got it. Upside-down day is great.

1:49:26.016 --> 1:49:28.060
- Yeah?
- This will be really good.

1:49:28.143 --> 1:49:29.228
Okay.

1:49:33.315 --> 1:49:37.611
Hey, Rex, tell them the story about
when Dad was barbecuing outside

1:49:37.695 --> 1:49:40.114
he was making all these hot dogs
and a bear came.

1:49:40.698 --> 1:49:42.449
That's a really good story.

1:49:42.533 --> 1:49:48.038
- Okay, so I think it was July 4th.
- Dad loves 4th of Julys.

1:49:53.002 --> 1:49:54.420
It's beautiful here.

1:50:00.175 --> 1:50:01.510
Are you okay?

1:50:05.889 --> 1:50:06.807
I'm here.

1:50:52.353 --> 1:50:53.812
Come on. Sun's going down.

1:50:55.939 --> 1:50:59.026
It's going. Come on,
he's not gonna wait for us.

1:51:03.155 --> 1:51:05.699
Come on. Don't wanna miss it.

1:51:09.119 --> 1:51:10.746
This is gonna be a beauty.

1:51:11.664 --> 1:51:13.666
Okay, that looks so beautiful.

1:52:06.260 --> 1:52:07.386
Bye-bye, Sun.

1:52:33.203 --> 1:52:34.830
Goodbye, old man.
