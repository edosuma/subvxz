03:04.280 --> 03:07.716
You're not double-checking this
stripping. I want it tighter.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.599
Let's pick up the pace.
We're behind schedule.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.673
Make sure those wires are hooked
in right. I don't want any accidents.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.397
How's it going, Franklin?
Let's keep it up.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.628
Let's move it, Barney!

03:28.800 --> 03:32.839
This is my 263,000th piece of glass,
the son of a bitch.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.073
If I never see another piece of glass
in my life, I'll be happy.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.231
There we go.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.630
You son of a bitch.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.791
Nice to see you working, Zeke.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.673
- What's happenin', Smoke?
- Hey, what it is!

04:06.840 --> 04:08.717
Everything. Lottery this week?

04:08.880 --> 04:11.838
Get down on this one
and tell me how good it's goin'.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.753
It's a good week. 300.
Here comes Miller. Gotta run.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.353
OK, baby. Take it easy.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.108
I've gotcha, Jerry.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.637
This is company time, Bartowski.
Hi, Smokey.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.234
This thing's a goddamn killer, Miller.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.675
I'm getting brain cancer.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.513
Man, don't even talk to me.
You're ugly, you stink.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.989
Everything about you is ugly -
your mama,

04:38.160 --> 04:40.594
your father, the whole family is ugly.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.433
Ugly, big gut motherfu...

05:20.720 --> 05:22.517
Come on.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.716
Jenkins! Back to work.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.519
This is the 15th time
this machine's screwed me.

05:30.680 --> 05:35.674
- When are you gonna get it fixed?
- Tell your union rep.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.515
All you ever do is say,
"Tell my union rep."

05:39.680 --> 05:44.549
Can we get started now? You people at
the coffee machine, sit down, will you?

05:44.720 --> 05:46.870
Let's go. We all wanna get out of here.

05:47.040 --> 05:52.353
We need two volunteers to help
pass out these pamphlets on Saturday.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.751
We all know how important
this ballot measure is.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.559
Now, who wants to help?

05:58.720 --> 06:02.030
You got a man in the back there.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.795
Come on, fellas. Nobody said it was
gonna be fun. Did I say...

06:05.960 --> 06:09.077
I got two jobs. They think I'll hand out
pamphlets on my day off?

06:09.240 --> 06:12.073
We gotta use our money
to hire somebody else.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.710
What's this "we" shit?
You're gonna be there, Clarence?

06:15.880 --> 06:17.791
I know you're all good union boys.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.997
The union does right by you.
You do right by the union!

06:21.160 --> 06:23.390
You're doing this for yourselves.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.791
Now, let's go.
Let's have some volunteers.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.554
- Zeke, I knew we could count on you.
- You can't.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.837
Not for Saturday, man.
I ain't handing out that shit.

06:35.120 --> 06:39.033
- What is it now, Zeke?
- About the union doing right by me.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.397
- What is it now, Zeke?
- My locker door.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.515
My locker's been busted for six months

06:47.680 --> 06:49.750
and the company
ain't did shit to fix it.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.275
I have to stick my finger
in a tiny-ass hole.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.671
I cut my finger, man, two weeks ago,
and it ain't healed yet.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.276
Now I have to use pens. I'm sticking 'em
in and they keep breaking off.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.115
- I blew $20 in ballpoint pens.
- Hey, be reasonable, Zeke.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.078
Reasonable? Man, flick my Bic.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.713
Reasonable? Six fuckin' months!

07:09.880 --> 07:12.678
You're my union shop steward,
and you ain't doin' shit.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.798
Take it to the green room
and get it straightened out.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.996
I can't go with every little thing.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.594
I gotta wait for something big.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.752
We can't let our power
be dissipated by the plant.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.832
Plant, my ass, man!
That's all you talk about, the plant!

07:27.000 --> 07:30.959
Everybody know what the plant is.
The plantjust short for plantation.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.714
Right on! I'm with that!

07:33.880 --> 07:36.075
All right! Now that Zeke is finished...

07:36.240 --> 07:39.516
Zeke ain't finished.
I'm gonna catch them dice.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.077
I'm gonna take my case
to the headquarters.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.357
Talk to the main man.
I'm gonna get some representation.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.115
- That's your right.
- You're goddamn right it's my right.

07:51.280 --> 07:56.195
It's also my right to run for union rep
and take your motherfuckin' job.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.233
I'll get a man some real representation.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.236
Don't nobody like your ass no how.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.278
When I take over yourjob,
you know what I'm gonna do?

08:11.440 --> 08:14.591
I'm gonna get on my private jet
and wing up to Palm Springs,

08:14.760 --> 08:18.833
hang out with Eddie Knuckles, and
hit a few golf balls with President Ford

08:19.000 --> 08:20.956
and Nixon and them motherfuckers.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.680
Let's get back to work here.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.229
- And my locker?
- We'll talk about that later.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.278
- And the $20 for the pens!
- We'll talk about that later.

08:29.440 --> 08:34.070
- This is some serious shit.
- We're still looking for volunteers.

08:34.320 --> 08:38.996
- What exactly did he do? Tell me that.
- I told you.

08:39.159 --> 08:42.755
Ask Smoke what he did.
He'll tell you. Right.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.912
Be nice to him. Kiss him.
Walk up to him, kiss him.

08:46.080 --> 08:49.516
- Don't involve me.
- Smoke... Excuse me, ladies. Smoke!

08:49.680 --> 08:53.116
Smoke, tell this man what you did.
The boy gotta learn sometime.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.032
I didn't do nothin'.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.509
He was president
at Jackson Penitentiary.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.956
Wasn't even elected
and was the president.

09:01.120 --> 09:05.750
Say, Hank, my man? Give me
a little break on the hillbilly music?

09:05.920 --> 09:09.833
It's my money and I'll play what I want.
That's what I like about the South.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.596
Hank. Thought he loved me.
I can't stand that motherfucker.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.399
Say, Smoke. I'm gonna tell the story.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.518
It started back when
he come up here from Mississippi.

09:20.680 --> 09:25.390
Didn't know nothing about pussy. He come
fuckin' around with his friend's wife.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.155
Is that a low motherfucker or what?
Fuckin' his friend's wife.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.754
Edna May Culver. Ugly motherfucker.

09:31.920 --> 09:36.471
- Hey, wait. She wasn't ugly, man.
- Pussy looked like a pork chop.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.916
Excuse me. I have to go over here
and straighten this shit out.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.072
- Excuse me.
- What's the matter with you, man?

09:45.240 --> 09:49.438
Why're you bringing up these stories
about me, huh? What'd I do to you?

09:49.600 --> 09:52.273
Bitch was a nymphomaniac too.
Fuck anything.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.908
Am I lying, Jerry?
Wasn't that bitch a nymph?

09:55.080 --> 09:57.548
You making it up, man!
This is what happened.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.234
My friend Leroy and I
were with this bitch.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.755
She wanted to get fucked by two dudes.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.229
She said her husband was out of town.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.516
Tell about when he knocked on the door!

10:08.720 --> 10:10.950
- Who's that?
- Who's that?

10:11.120 --> 10:14.032
Now, wait, hold it.
What happened was...

10:14.200 --> 10:18.398
We were in there smoking, and we hear
this motherfucker coming up the steps.

10:18.560 --> 10:22.473
Leroy says, "We've gotta get
out of here." I says, "You're right."

10:22.640 --> 10:25.438
Leroy says,
"On the signal, I'll open up the door."

10:25.600 --> 10:28.956
So he opened the door,
and I ran up and hit this motherfucker.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.759
- Did you fire on him?
- Hello!

10:31.920 --> 10:34.275
In the balls, in the mouth.
Straight razor.

10:34.440 --> 10:37.193
Get down and I say,
"I'm gonna cut you, mother..."

10:37.360 --> 10:40.670
I looked down and it was
the motherfuckin' police.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.673
Knockin' on the door,
lookin' for somebody next door.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.752
That was a cold motherfuckin' shot, man.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.230
Why didn't you just explain
the situation to them?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.470
Come on, get up, Bambi.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.710
Why didn't you explain the situation?

10:54.880 --> 10:58.589
Hey, man! Tell this motherfucker.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.716
A nigger hit a roller on 12th Street,

11:00.880 --> 11:03.838
you don't be talkin' 'bout explaining.
Shit.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.278
- Three years for hittin' a cop?
- No, that was the second time.

11:08.440 --> 11:12.433
The first time,
this motherfucker killed somebody.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.637
I ain't killed nobody, man.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.360
Mother was dead. Somebody killed him.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.590
I never killed nobody.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.557
OK, brother.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.312
I'm leaving.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.155
Wait a minute. You ladies going
with this big nigger? Shit.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.790
Leave your fingerprints
cos he gonna eat up everything else.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.837
- I'm gonna try.
- All right.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.596
- Have mercy!
- Time for me to pump some gas.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.232
- Later, Zeke.
- All right. Take it easy, Jer.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.389
Hurry up.
Let's get us some beers!

13:12.280 --> 13:15.158
Party! Party!

13:18.880 --> 13:22.668
Party! Get down! Party!

13:28.680 --> 13:33.117
Yo, bro! I'm gonna have to find a new
place to drink. There's niggers here.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.271
- Let's get it on!
- Hot damn!

13:35.440 --> 13:37.954
- You watch out.
- My motor needs some gas.

13:38.120 --> 13:42.033
Take more than gas to get your
motor going. You need overhaulin'.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.795
- Have mercy! Need overhaulin'?
- Here, it's on me.

13:45.960 --> 13:49.839
You don't mind if I sit down
and ask you some questions?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.594
I don't mind. Not if you're paying.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.478
You guys work at Checker, right?

13:54.640 --> 13:57.712
Just in the summer.
In the winter, we work on Wall Street.

13:57.880 --> 14:02.351
Yeah, the thing is,
I'm an instructor at Eastern Michigan.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.957
I'm doing this doctoral thesis on
the union movement here in Detroit.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.669
I wanted to ask you about
your union and Eddie Johnson.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.912
Nobody fucks with Eddie Johnson.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.957
Silly motherfucker.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.317
What's this thesis shit?
Something to do with sex?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.516
Not exactly.

14:21.680 --> 14:25.309
I understand you pay them white boys
big money to be fuckin' now.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.313
- I wouldn't know about that, man.
- You pay by the inch?

14:28.480 --> 14:31.119
If you do,
Smoke is gonna make a million dollars.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.032
That's not exactly my field.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.829
- You ever been paid for it, Smoke?
- Shit.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.753
Don't let them bother you.
What do you want?

14:39.920 --> 14:43.549
- Who's your union rep?
- Clarence A.K. Hill.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.518
- A.K.'s for ass kisser.
- Ass kisser.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.399
You think Hill and Johnson
are in touch with the men?

14:49.560 --> 14:53.838
Johnson was a ball-buster when he first
came up, but that was 30 years ago.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.037
That's right. Them motherfuckers
are all the same now.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.270
Four more of these, please.

14:59.440 --> 15:04.912
See, you take young guys like you
on the line today, guys with families.

15:06.120 --> 15:10.352
- Hey, scumbag.
- I beg your pardon?

15:10.520 --> 15:12.829
This phony honky
ain't no college nothin'.

15:13.000 --> 15:13.989
What?

15:14.160 --> 15:17.197
This phony honky
ain't no college instructor.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.033
He never was,
never will be but what he is.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.071
Yeah. I'm talkin' to you.

15:23.240 --> 15:27.518
I'm telling you that you're the
motherfuckin' FBI. Now call me a liar.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.477
- Son of a bitch.
- You shittin'?

15:29.640 --> 15:33.235
Man, I've seen your face around, clown.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.915
I'm just an instructor. I just
wanted to ask you about the union.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.868
- Are you're ashamed of your union?
- Ashamed?

15:41.040 --> 15:45.352
Listen, asshole, we went out three years
ago for 73, count 'em, fuckin' days.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.353
- I was on the picket line every day.
- That's right.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.239
I'm still payin' off
the money I had to borrow.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.995
You know what, asshole? We got
our raise! I'm proud of my union!

15:55.160 --> 15:59.631
I don't understand why you let the union
rip you off as much as management.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.439
It's like you wanna get fucked over.

16:02.600 --> 16:07.469
Get out. You don't know shit. What
the fuck do you know about the union?

16:07.640 --> 16:09.153
When I was workin' the line,

16:09.320 --> 16:12.312
you were deciding what to wear
to your sorority dance.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.517
All right. It ain't my kids
who have to go without shoes.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.912
- Motherfucker, you can't say anything!
- Settle down, fellas.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.514
- Somebody owes me 2.60.
- He ordered 'em.

16:24.880 --> 16:28.759
- I've been asked to leave.
- You can stay. Pay for the beers.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.037
- Just don't talk about my union.
- Pay for it.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.470
Keep the change, baby.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.837
- I'm gonna play pinball.
- I'm gonna get down myself.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.957
See if you can beat 72,626 runs.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.078
With two broken legs,
my hands tied behind my back.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.074
<i> I thought it'd be friendly</i>
<i>to throw a dinner party for Mr Bentley</i>.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.438
<i>You're always wanting to get fancied up,</i>
<i>trying be something you're not</i>.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.151
<i>The party was my idea</i>.
<i>Making it formal was George's idea</i>.

17:02.320 --> 17:07.075
This shit is pitiful. I don't know how
a nigger like that gets some money.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.628
That's dumb shit.
Look at this motherfucker.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.394
He's like a motherfuckin' ostrich.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.551
Look at that shit!

17:15.720 --> 17:17.711
Why don't you turn it off?

17:17.880 --> 17:21.589
Are you kidding? It took me three years
to pay for that motherfucker.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.309
We gonna watch everything they show
on there, all the shit they show.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.677
Even the snow
when the motherfucker go off.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.559
It's the only thing in the house
that works anyway.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.359
- You lost. It's my turn.
- Gloria pushed my arm!

17:34.520 --> 17:37.717
Bullshit! I didn't touch you.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.836
You in trouble now.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.992
Can't you take turns?
Do you have to break everything?

17:43.160 --> 17:46.118
Get you all something that won't break,
like blocks.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.431
- I didn't break it!
- It wasn't any good anyway.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.194
What you mean?
You got any money to pay for it?

17:52.360 --> 17:54.828
Then shut the fuck up, Jack,
till you get a job.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.956
You oughta be ashamed too, Gloria.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.669
If that's your brother, tell him we ate.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.195
Why you so cold on my brother?

18:03.360 --> 18:05.510
I don't like to cook for him.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.352
- Who is it?
- Mr Brown?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.829
- Yes?
- I'm Mr Berg from Internal Revenue.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.595
- I don't want none!
- I'm not a salesman. Here's my ID.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.354
I'm with Internal Revenue.
Here's my card.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.557
- Just a minute.
- Here you go. See that?

18:19.720 --> 18:22.359
I'm with Internal Revenue.
I'm in the field tonight.

18:22.520 --> 18:26.229
I thought I'd stop by
and save you a trip to the office.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.834
- It don't look like you.
- It's an old picture.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.833
- Caroline, we got company.
- Good evening.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.991
- Caroline, Mr Bracket.
- No, Mr Berg.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.197
- I'm with Internal Revenue.
- Your shirt's all fouled up.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.114
It's my last account, my last stop
tonight, and I had a leaky pen.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.840
- Why don't you get him a beer?
- No, thank you.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.231
I'm gonna eat in a half hour.
It'll ruin my appetite.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.960
- Thank you.
- Always glad to help the government.

18:50.120 --> 18:53.192
Yes, we all work for Uncle Sam
in one way or another.

18:53.360 --> 18:57.353
- What seems to be the problem?
- Two discrepancies in your returns.

18:57.520 --> 19:02.389
Discrepancies, huh? My wife and I been
having one of 'em each year. Children.

19:02.560 --> 19:07.190
But according to the hospital records,
you claim six, and you only have three.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.669
My records show that, huh?

19:09.840 --> 19:13.389
I couldn't have
all my kids in the hospital.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.109
We have Sugar Ray Brown,
you got Gloria Brown,

19:17.280 --> 19:19.840
O.J. Brown,
Gayle Sayers Brown, Jim Brown,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.468
Stevie Wonder Brown...
Who's Stevie Wonder?

19:22.640 --> 19:25.200
He's a singer.

19:25.360 --> 19:29.592
That's terrific. That's nice.
Where are the children?

19:29.760 --> 19:33.548
Dennis and Gloria
and their friend are here.

19:33.720 --> 19:37.269
The rest of the kids... It's hard
to keep track of the kids, man.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.512
They're in the streets
playin' in the neighbourhood.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.229
Caroline will find 'em for you.
Would you find the rest of the kids?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.675
- The kids...
- Take the kids with you, baby.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.513
- Come on, you guys.
- No, thank you, Mrs Brown.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.831
- I don't want a beer.
- You might want it later.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.674
- She's a good woman.
- Lovely woman.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.353
Mr Brown, our records show

19:58.520 --> 20:01.318
that you held a part-time job
and didn't declare it.

20:01.480 --> 20:04.040
You worked as a house painter
for 20 days?

20:04.920 --> 20:07.514
Thatjob, man,
that was a favour for a friend.

20:07.680 --> 20:11.514
That's what you get when you help
a friend. You worked 20 days.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.116
I'm sure you just forgot,
but you'll have to pay the back taxes,

20:15.280 --> 20:18.556
plus the late penalty, which comes to...
I'll figure it out.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.438
Let's see.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.230
Mary? It's Caroline!

20:24.400 --> 20:26.470
- Come on in, girl!
- Thank you.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.473
Am I glad you're home.
Listen, I have a problem.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.596
I got the IRS man at the house.

20:31.760 --> 20:35.309
- Zeke claimed we had six kids.
- Six kids?

20:35.480 --> 20:37.948
- Has that man lost his mind?
- I don't know.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.759
When were you supposed
to have these kids?

20:40.920 --> 20:43.434
I got a problem.
If you'll lend me your kids,

20:43.600 --> 20:46.797
and we could switch my kids
into some of your kids' clothes,

20:46.960 --> 20:50.032
- he wouldn't know the difference.
- It's worth a try.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.589
Come on, take off your top.
Can you get it?

20:53.680 --> 20:57.559
It's $295 for the second job.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.155
But when you add the three
false deductions over six years,

21:02.320 --> 21:05.312
it comes out to... Let's see.

21:06.560 --> 21:11.509
Let's see. That's right. $2,460.75.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.194
Jesus. Fuck.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.871
It's not me. It's Uncle Sam.

21:18.040 --> 21:22.591
You have to find a way to pay it. I
have to take a statement on you tonight.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.029
Man, where am I gonna get
that kind of money?

21:28.200 --> 21:32.352
Shit, you're talking about...
You're talking about my life.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.080
- Maybe we could...
- Let's go.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.959
Come on in, Caroline.
She got the kids.

21:38.120 --> 21:41.715
Mr Brown, you didn't have to
go through this. It's not right.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.836
- I just...
- Just check off them names.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.709
- I need the certificates.
- This is Sonny, Gayle, Sugar Ray.

21:47.880 --> 21:51.350
What's your name? Your name?
What's your name?

21:51.520 --> 21:54.956
What's your name?
Are you a girl or a boy?

21:55.120 --> 21:58.271
- They don't have names.
- I told them not to speak to strangers.

21:58.440 --> 22:02.991
Listen, you must have certificates.
Please, I'd like to get home myself!

22:03.160 --> 22:06.675
I'd like to get home.
These are not your children.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.274
I take home 210 a week. Goddamn.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.989
I gotta pay for the lights,
gas, clothes, food.

22:13.160 --> 22:17.517
Every fuckin' thing, man! I'm left with
about 30 bucks after all the bills.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.035
Give me a break, will you, mister?

22:20.200 --> 22:23.954
- Mr Brown, I work for Uncle Sam.
- Fuck Uncle Sam, man!

22:24.120 --> 22:28.398
They give the fuckin' politicians a
break! Agnew and them don't pay shit!

22:28.560 --> 22:30.835
Workin' man's gotta
pay every goddamn thing!

22:31.000 --> 22:33.753
- Don't say that about Uncle Sam.
- Don't point at me!

22:33.920 --> 22:36.480
Get out of my house!
I'll pay the goddamn money!

22:36.640 --> 22:39.677
- You bet you'll pay it.
- I know I will!

22:39.840 --> 22:44.072
If I had the navy and marines behind me,
I'd be a motherfucker too!

23:06.680 --> 23:09.353
Had a good time the other night.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.673
- I was gonna ask you something.
- I don't know nothing.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.798
- I was gonna come by your house, but...
- Hey, listen, man!

23:18.960 --> 23:22.873
Nobody comes near my house,
nobody I don't invite.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.914
Three bucks.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.911
You know Clarence Hill, don't you?

23:33.080 --> 23:36.959
You were his key man before
he was promoted to shop steward.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.714
He just bought a big house
out in Woodland Hills.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.633
- I don't know nothing about that.
- Come on!

23:42.800 --> 23:45.109
- I know nothing about no house!
- Come on!

23:45.280 --> 23:48.875
Nothing about no Clarence Hill,
no union. I don't know shit!

23:49.040 --> 23:52.430
Everybody knows your local's
the most corrupt in the city.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.874
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:54.040 --> 23:58.352
You got your man in the union and the
union's got its man in the government.

23:58.520 --> 24:02.149
And if I farted upwind, I'd be
out of a job in an hour, wouldn't I?

24:02.320 --> 24:06.108
- But you seem like a guy...
- I don't talk to no government agent.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.511
Tired?

24:26.280 --> 24:28.191
Jerry?

24:31.280 --> 24:33.794
Your back still hurts you,
don't it, honey?

24:42.440 --> 24:45.000
The school nurse called today

24:45.160 --> 24:47.720
to say that Debby's gotta
have those teeth braces.

24:47.880 --> 24:52.351
I'm just warning you because she's gonna
ask you for them again tomorrow.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.670
- Excuse me, miss.
- Just a minute.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.477
My name's Ezekial Brown.
I'm here to see Mr Johnson.

25:38.640 --> 25:44.272
Mr Johnson, there's a man here
by the name of Ezekial Brown.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.351
You can go on in.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.469
Oh, hi, Zeke. Come on in.

25:51.560 --> 25:56.111
- How do you do?
- Have a seat. What's your problem?

25:56.280 --> 26:00.990
I want to complain
about Clarence Hill, Mr Johnson.

26:01.160 --> 26:05.631
I want to complain. Clarence Hill is
a shop steward at the Checker plant.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.951
Man, I don't know how he got
his job cos he's a fucking racist.

26:09.120 --> 26:13.318
- What do you mean?
- Black workers can't get a thing done.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.313
When white brothers
want something done, it's done.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.675
Niggers don't get shit done.
It's not fair.

26:18.840 --> 26:23.550
Zeke, our local was the first to insist
on parity for black and white for wages.

26:23.720 --> 26:28.077
Our local has the best relations
of black and white in the union.

26:28.240 --> 26:32.711
I ain't got nothing against the union.
It's been fair concerning wages.

26:32.880 --> 26:36.156
But damn,
wages ain't the problem no more.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.357
It's the fuckin' prices.
Everything's so goddamn high.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.511
The more you make, the less it's worth.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.989
What exactly is your problem, Zeke?

26:44.160 --> 26:46.993
My locker.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.118
I've been waiting six months
to get my locker fixed.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.919
I damn near tore my finger off
trying to open it up,

26:53.080 --> 26:56.038
like some kid,
and Clarence Hill don't do shit.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.397
Janet, get me Clarence Hill.
He'll be at home.

26:59.560 --> 27:02.677
I ain't no kid. I have to
stick my finger in a little hole,

27:02.840 --> 27:05.718
- and I tore my finger.
- How long have you been on the line?

27:05.880 --> 27:08.599
Seven years. Chrysler, Ford, mostly.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.558
But goddamn, man,
I need a little lighten up.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.792
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Mr Hill must be out.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.918
Yeah. Thanks, Janet. Clarence?

27:18.880 --> 27:22.350
No, I'm fine.
Clarence, I got Zeke Brown here.

27:22.520 --> 27:27.753
He has a complaint about his locker.
Will you see that you get it fixed?

27:27.920 --> 27:31.196
- Tell him about my finger.
- Yeah. Good.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.432
Now, you keep me informed.
Thanks.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.750
I'll talk to you later, Clarence.

27:38.080 --> 27:41.117
That oughta fix it, Zeke.
Now, is there anything else?

27:44.640 --> 27:47.313
Nothin' I can think of right now.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.789
- Thank you for your help.
- It's all right.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.918
Anytime, you come right in here.
That's what I'm here for.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.629
To take your complaints and to help.
That's what the union means.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.711
Thank you.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.636
Oh, damn!

28:37.800 --> 28:39.677
Damn what?

28:41.440 --> 28:43.954
I forgot to lock one of the pumps.

28:44.120 --> 28:48.193
Do you have to do it now?
Can't you do it in the morning?

28:48.360 --> 28:51.477
What, and have to pay for
the gas that's stolen tonight?

28:57.240 --> 29:00.073
Besides, I want to sleep in
with you in the morning.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.754
Will you go to Mass with me?

29:06.920 --> 29:09.992
OK. Just this once.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.998
Zeke? Where are you going?

29:26.160 --> 29:29.470
- I'm goin' to help Rason move.
- Rason? What?

29:29.640 --> 29:33.872
He got a new apartment
and he's gonna move in it tonight.

29:34.040 --> 29:38.113
He's gotta beat the two months' rent
he owes them other people.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.748
How come
you're putting on your new pants?

29:40.920 --> 29:43.992
New? You kidding me?
I work in these pants.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.833
You just got them. Where are you going?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.560
- What's the matter?
- Where are you going?

29:49.720 --> 29:52.473
- To help my partner.
- Don't mess with me.

29:52.640 --> 29:56.030
- I'm funky.
- What shirt you're gonna wear?

29:56.200 --> 29:58.555
I'm wearing this old nasty-ass shirt.

29:58.720 --> 30:02.315
- Goddamn. What's the matter?
- Who do you think you're playing with?

30:02.480 --> 30:05.677
I ain't never lied to you.
Jesus, I gotta get outta here.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.469
Nigger not gonna want me
to be helping him, bad as I smell.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.631
You don't got to come back.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.797
What's happening, my man?

30:20.960 --> 30:24.794
- How'd you get away from your old lady?
- Caroline knows who the boss is.

30:24.960 --> 30:28.555
- Bet you handcuffed her to the bed.
- Who can afford handcuffs?

30:28.720 --> 30:31.871
I used the clothes line.
What kind of lie you tell Arlene?

30:32.040 --> 30:34.873
Said I had to go to the gas station,
lock up a pump.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.555
Smoke, we're here!
Get 'em undressed, my man!

30:41.160 --> 30:43.594
How you doing?

30:52.200 --> 30:54.714
Oh, my God. Lord have mercy.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.871
Party down!

31:08.080 --> 31:11.789
- Jerry Bartowski. Nice to meet you.
- Cathy.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.308
Jesus, there must be
three weeks of pay here.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.436
What do you mean three? Five!

31:26.440 --> 31:28.112
Oh, shit!

31:28.280 --> 31:32.239
Motherfuckin' shit went all up in here,
down here, run right to my dick.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.311
Oh, please!

31:34.480 --> 31:37.074
Pay attention
to that motherfucker Jerry.

31:37.240 --> 31:40.073
Think his baby was born
by the telephone.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.828
At least it was my phone.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.309
I'm not going to be
at the plant all my life.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.515
- How long have you been there?
- Ten years.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.718
Motherfucker's so big
you can walk in standin' up.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.110
Who's he talking about?

32:10.280 --> 32:14.273
It ain't who, it's what. I'm talking
about the safe at union headquarters.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.271
It's big.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.912
The safe, motherfucker,
I'm talking about.

32:21.080 --> 32:25.232
It's big. We can take it for big money.

32:25.400 --> 32:29.678
I ain't saying we should,
but if we did, we'd be rich.

32:29.840 --> 32:33.116
Jerry, I'm talking to you about
some paper, motherfucker.

32:35.800 --> 32:39.679
Zeke, I'm a little
preoccupied, you know?

32:39.840 --> 32:41.831
A little?

32:49.840 --> 32:54.516
Every time I get coked up, I think
I'm never gonna go back to the plant.

32:54.680 --> 32:59.196
- I don't know why the fuck I do.
- The credit man needs your paycheque.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.833
Credit's the only thing
you can get free from the company.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.709
Got a house, fridge,

33:08.880 --> 33:12.031
dishwasher, washer/dryer, TV,

33:12.200 --> 33:14.953
stereo, motorcycle, car.

33:15.120 --> 33:18.317
Buy this shit, buy that shit.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.789
All you got's a bunch of shit.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.951
You don't even own it.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.317
You can't give it back
cos it's already broke down.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.674
Sometimes I get so depressed.

33:32.560 --> 33:35.996
I start thinking about
shit I promised Caroline.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.919
Shit I ain't never gonna be able to do.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.390
And I know a man's
supposed to take care of his family.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.756
- Jesus.
- I never was good with money, man.

33:52.920 --> 33:56.230
I'm just fuckin' always broke, you know?

33:56.400 --> 33:59.198
I fuckin' can't get the knack
of that shit.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.190
God knows I try, man.

34:05.920 --> 34:10.232
I think if Smokey wasn't around,
we wouldn't have no motherfuckin' fun.

34:12.920 --> 34:16.150
I swore I wouldn't work
during my vacation this year.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.675
How am I gonna get three grand?

34:18.840 --> 34:22.992
I can't fuck with them dago loan sharks
because they fuck with your family.

34:23.159 --> 34:26.630
Then hit that safe
you're all the time talkin' about.

34:26.800 --> 34:31.271
- You kiddin', man? That's our union.
- You said it was a knock-over.

34:31.440 --> 34:35.274
- It was the coke talkin'.
- Well, is it a knock-over or not?

34:35.440 --> 34:39.353
It's a knock-over, man.
Pussy, for that matter.

34:39.520 --> 34:43.877
They ain't got nothing but one guard,
white dude, picks his nose all day.

34:45.120 --> 34:48.476
- He ain't even a real roller.
- Then hit it.

34:48.639 --> 34:53.395
- You've done worse, man.
- Shit, it's our union, man.

34:54.639 --> 34:58.758
- That'd really be a killer.
- They ain't done shit for us, man.

35:00.320 --> 35:04.836
Be like we was takin'
what belonged to us anyway, huh?

35:07.000 --> 35:11.118
- How many night guards they got?
- I don't know.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.232
- What do you think, huh?
- Nah, I couldn't do it.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.312
Somebody oughta show 'em a lesson.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.233
They treat us worse
than the company does.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.516
There ain't no way to do it.

35:27.680 --> 35:31.559
I'd sure like to see
the look on their faces.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.309
What'd you think about
what we was talkin' about?

36:03.480 --> 36:06.438
- The union job?
- Shut up, man.

36:07.840 --> 36:12.470
Smokey and me gonna talk about it
some more tonight at Little Jo's.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.756
Do you want in?

36:16.080 --> 36:18.230
Here comes Dogshit Miller already.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.119
Let's go, donkeys.
Off your asses and on your feet.

36:21.280 --> 36:25.512
- The cars want your sweet attention.
- We know, Miller.

36:27.440 --> 36:31.877
Old captain asshole. How did he get
his job? That's what I'd like to know.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.430
Come on, Smokey.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.193
Son of a bitch!

37:05.080 --> 37:08.197
- Smokey, have you got any side effects?
- From the party?

37:08.360 --> 37:09.759
Yeah.

37:09.920 --> 37:13.595
- I just had a headache.
- No, I mean like a crotch rot.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.957
You're crazy, man.
All those pussies were clean.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.793
That's what I figured.
Give me five.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.155
Got another case
of psychosomatic crabs.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.392
You should've stuck to Mary Thumb
and her four daughters.

37:25.560 --> 37:29.792
They always get me the worst
when I'm with Arlene. God!

37:40.400 --> 37:42.311
Sixteenth time, you bastard!

37:45.360 --> 37:48.033
You ain't gonna do this to me
ever again, you fuck!

37:48.200 --> 37:50.919
You fuckin' asshole machine!

38:21.640 --> 38:24.632
Jenkins! Goddamn it!

38:27.520 --> 38:30.080
Goddamn it, Jenkins! What are you doing?

38:30.240 --> 38:34.916
I'm docking you for every goddamn penny!
Every goddamn penny!

38:35.080 --> 38:38.072
- All right!
- Son of a bitch, you're gonna pay!

38:38.240 --> 38:41.835
You idiot!
You're off of the job for two weeks!

38:43.720 --> 38:46.234
You don't have to
take that shit, Jenkins!

38:46.400 --> 38:49.915
<i> The odds are seven to one against</i>
<i>you, but that's not bad</i>.

38:50.080 --> 38:53.959
<i>- Go and point to another card and</i>...
- I want some more, Dad.

38:54.120 --> 38:56.793
I'm hungry.
Can I have some of yours?

38:56.960 --> 38:59.952
Look, it says right here
it's good for four helpings.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.999
- There. "Serves four."
- I'm still hungry.

39:04.160 --> 39:07.436
- Write the company.
- Can I have some of yours, Mom?

39:07.600 --> 39:10.239
Here, Bobby,
have another piece of bread.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.635
What about Debby?
She ain't ate anything.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.030
Where's Debby?

39:19.200 --> 39:23.671
Debby! Come to the table, honey!
Your food's getting cold!

39:23.840 --> 39:25.876
Go easy on her.
She's had a hard day.

39:26.040 --> 39:29.430
- What's wrong with her?
- She doesn't feel well.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.036
Debby, come here!
What's wrong?

39:34.640 --> 39:40.351
<i> I'll be back to give away $750</i>
<i>right after these messages</i>.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.751
You know how she wanted
to be on the baton team.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.593
What happened?
How come nobody tells me anything?

39:46.760 --> 39:50.150
- I didn't get a chance yet.
- Let Daddy see.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.839
What happened, sweetheart?
What you... Debby!

39:56.000 --> 39:57.956
Jerry, let her go.

39:58.120 --> 40:03.240
She tried to make braces
out of a piece of wire.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.751
Jesus Christ.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.950
Jesus Christ, Arlene.

40:29.040 --> 40:32.350
Let's get them goddamned braces.
Get 'em tomorrow.

40:32.520 --> 40:35.034
We'll worry about the bill
when it comes.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.478
- We can have another garage sale.
- What've we got to sell?

40:42.960 --> 40:45.269
We'd be better off
if I didn't work at all.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.590
At least we could collect welfare.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.955
Hey, Jerry.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.833
Hey, Jerry. You just missed him.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.912
Dogshit Miller wanted to take you
for a ride in his new car.

41:09.080 --> 41:12.072
Then he's gonna drop it off
at your house as a present.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.118
I was thinkin' about
what you guys were talkin' about.

41:15.280 --> 41:19.114
- You really gonna do it?
- We gettin' down! Be with that.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.794
Smokey knows this girl...

41:26.240 --> 41:29.949
She used to work at the place.
She knows the whole place upside down.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.998
Gonna have a meeting
tomorrow night at Smokey's house.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.196
- You gonna carry Roscoes?
- What?

41:35.360 --> 41:39.478
Man, no pieces. Just a simple
breaking and entering, man.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.473
And it better be grand larceny too, huh?

41:42.640 --> 41:44.870
How much do you think there could be?

41:46.200 --> 41:48.555
Maybe five, six thousand.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.670
What do you think?

41:59.040 --> 42:01.634
Charlie T will show us
how to open the safe.

42:01.800 --> 42:05.998
- He's rough. What's he want?
- A hundred bills and 10% of the take.

42:06.160 --> 42:09.232
Jesus. I'm busted, man.
I got about ten bucks.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.278
- Got a ring I can pawn.
- Tell the man it's a deal.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.431
Catch you later.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.671
A roller passes every 15 minutes.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.149
Security guard checks it
every hour at night,

42:24.320 --> 42:26.675
usually about quarter past the hour.

42:26.840 --> 42:30.116
- Do they have CCTV?
- No, just an electric eye.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.158
Electric eye! Shit.
I saw one of those in <i>The Pink Panther</i>.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.880
They can nail you good.
They can weigh you.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.554
Tell if you're a man or a woman,
how old your mama is.

42:38.720 --> 42:41.029
It's like an electric eye
in a supermarket.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.237
It's not, man!
Those fuckin' things are good.

42:44.400 --> 42:46.994
- What car are we gonna use?
- We can use mine.

42:47.160 --> 42:52.314
Use this pussy wagon? Cops'll spot
this showboat clear across the lake.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.074
- Why don't we use yours?
- It needs a new gas pump.

42:55.240 --> 42:59.313
It needs a new everything.
Why don't you get a new gas pump?

42:59.480 --> 43:01.596
- Maybe we should chip in for it.
- Chip in?

43:01.760 --> 43:03.876
Come on, we're in this even.

43:05.080 --> 43:08.516
Do we need any masks,
disguises, something like that?

43:08.680 --> 43:11.399
- Maybe, just in case.
- Bandanas?

43:11.560 --> 43:15.872
If I get busted, I don't want to go
downtown lookin' like no cowboy.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.078
Maybe we should get
some Halloween masks.

43:20.240 --> 43:23.118
Yeah, get you a motherfuckin'
King Kong suit.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.714
Who's in the Buick?

43:25.880 --> 43:28.997
That's that bitch
I was telling you about, the fox.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.515
Fox!

43:31.680 --> 43:35.593
She ain't good-looking.
Man, the bitch is a bow-wow.

43:35.760 --> 43:38.069
You wouldn't know class
if you fell in it.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.708
- The bitch is fine.
- The bitch is not fine.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.871
She looks like she eats Gaines Burgers.

43:43.040 --> 43:46.510
- Ugly motherfucker. Is the bitch fine?
- I don't know.

43:46.680 --> 43:49.148
See?

43:53.840 --> 43:56.434
- Hey, can I have a quarter?
- What?

43:56.600 --> 44:00.479
- Can I have a quarter?
- Yeah, sure.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.949
Let me have them glasses.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.559
Got change for a 20?

44:07.720 --> 44:09.358
- Yep.
- Too bad.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.517
My fuckin' ring. Shit!

44:36.680 --> 44:39.956
- Smokey, my man!
- Hey, what's happenin'?

44:40.120 --> 44:42.429
Looky here, you want some watches?

44:42.600 --> 44:44.716
Got a great deal for you today.

44:44.880 --> 44:48.350
Sixteen-jewel, gold-plated,
made by Cartier.

44:48.520 --> 44:51.318
Over the counter these
would cost you $150 a piece.

44:51.480 --> 44:54.756
- Made by Cartier?
- Made by Cartier.

44:54.920 --> 44:56.831
The man himself.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.911
Why the fuck it don't say no Cartier?

44:59.080 --> 45:03.278
- They're made for bargain stores.
- What do you take me for, man?

45:03.440 --> 45:06.716
- It's not a fucking Cartier.
- This is a good deal, man.

45:06.880 --> 45:09.633
- Because you're my main man.
- I'm your main what?

45:09.800 --> 45:11.950
I'm giving you a special.
Three for twenty.

45:12.120 --> 45:14.315
- How much you want?
- Three for twenty.

45:14.480 --> 45:17.278
- I'm gonna give you ten.
- What kinda fool you think I am?

45:17.440 --> 45:19.510
- Later.
- Not so fast.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.989
The watches sold
to the man with the money.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.277
I got the disguises.

45:31.440 --> 45:35.228
Everything's set.
OK, synchronise your watches.

45:35.400 --> 45:38.517
- I ain't got no watch, Smokey.
- Mine's broke.

45:38.680 --> 45:41.069
You're both in luck.
I got some watches today.

45:41.240 --> 45:44.949
Sixteen-jewel, Cartier, gold-plated.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.712
Only ten bucks each.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.709
- Where they at, man?
- Be cool.

46:17.880 --> 46:20.394
Maybe we should've
robbed a liquor store.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.996
Are you kidding?
I could never pull a real robbery.

46:24.160 --> 46:27.357
- What the fuck you call this?
- Getting back.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.956
- My ass. Tell it to the rollers.
- Here they come.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.234
Let's go.

46:40.400 --> 46:44.109
- Put your gloves on.
- Ready, man.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.434
There's the eyes.

47:44.280 --> 47:46.953
- You see it?
- Yeah.

48:20.920 --> 48:23.115
Take it slow, man.

48:23.280 --> 48:28.434
I'm sorry.
You got the diagram?

48:41.320 --> 48:42.912
Smoke?

48:43.080 --> 48:45.674
I think it's open.

48:48.640 --> 48:52.155
- It's open.
- Holy fuck!

49:04.480 --> 49:08.632
Oh, no! It's empty!

49:08.800 --> 49:12.315
No wonder it's a knock-over.
They don't keep anything here.

49:12.480 --> 49:16.519
That can't be, man! Shit!

49:21.640 --> 49:25.553
- This is stupid. Let's get out.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

49:25.720 --> 49:27.597
Wait! Here's the safe.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.228
That's where they keep the money.

49:30.400 --> 49:34.313
- How are we gonna open it?
- Let's get it outta here.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.436
Who's that?

49:39.600 --> 49:41.795
- Maybe the guard.
- Oh, man.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.838
- Why's he stopping?
- What time is it?

49:45.920 --> 49:48.150
- It's 12:30.
- I got 12:15.

49:48.320 --> 49:50.276
Mine's stopped.

49:51.880 --> 49:53.916
- Close the door.
- What?

49:54.080 --> 49:57.072
- Close the door!
- We'll suffocate.

49:57.240 --> 49:59.800
Turn out the light.

49:59.960 --> 50:02.155
Smoke...

50:02.320 --> 50:04.311
Get the disguises.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.151
Did you kill him?

50:56.320 --> 50:58.436
No, he's all right.

51:00.040 --> 51:02.713
Let's get the safe.

51:02.880 --> 51:05.792
Then let's get the hell out of here.

51:20.040 --> 51:23.237
- OK.
- Hope you didn't burn up everything.

51:27.280 --> 51:30.317
- Just more papers.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

51:30.480 --> 51:35.110
Here's the cash. Petty cash.

51:35.280 --> 51:37.635
Where's the money?

51:41.920 --> 51:44.150
How much is there, man?

51:44.320 --> 51:47.278
- This is all chicken shit.
- Six hundred.

51:47.440 --> 51:50.273
- Son of a bitch! Six hundred?
- Shit!

51:50.440 --> 51:52.715
We're a regular James Gang.

51:53.960 --> 51:57.111
- At least it's grand larceny.
- At least it's something.

51:57.280 --> 52:00.113
And slugging the guard
makes it assault and battery.

52:00.280 --> 52:02.475
- Let's split the shit.
- OK.

52:02.640 --> 52:05.234
A hundred for Charlie T plus 10%,
that's 160.

52:05.400 --> 52:08.710
- Fuck Charlie T.
- That's 240, that's 440.

52:08.880 --> 52:12.236
- That's 140 apiece.
- I risked my ass for this chicken shit.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.960
- Plus 20.
- For the masks and the disguises.

52:15.120 --> 52:17.076
- Money for the gas pump?
- Fuck that.

52:17.240 --> 52:19.913
- Let's throw fingers for it.
- I'll throw fingers.

52:20.080 --> 52:22.150
- Odd man.
- One, two, three!

52:22.320 --> 52:24.550
That wasn't fair. Zeke put in late.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.951
- He didn't put in late?
- We'll throw again. One, two, three!

52:28.120 --> 52:29.997
See? Now, fuck with that.

52:30.160 --> 52:32.390
- Fuckin' lucky.
- I got a good finger.

52:32.560 --> 52:35.836
- What about the safe?
- I ain't paying for this watch.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.911
I'll take care of the safe.

52:38.080 --> 52:41.550
I got a brother who lives
by the city dump. I'll just drop it off.

52:41.720 --> 52:45.474
- Give him the watch.
- Caroline's gonna kick my ass.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.438
Maybe they got a false bottom
in this motherfucker.

52:49.600 --> 52:52.797
That's all I can say now.
The police are investigating.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.155
How much was taken?

52:55.320 --> 52:57.959
We're still trying to determine that.

52:58.120 --> 53:01.635
We heard it was over $10,000.
Is that true?

53:04.880 --> 53:06.836
Yeah, you could say that.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.150
And then what happened?

53:09.320 --> 53:12.278
Well, it was crazy.
They just came right out of the safe.

53:12.440 --> 53:15.671
Two black guys
with a white one in the middle.

53:15.840 --> 53:18.229
Like an Oreo cookie.

53:18.400 --> 53:21.358
What did
the two black guys look like?

53:21.520 --> 53:24.512
I really don't know. They had disguises.

53:24.680 --> 53:26.875
What about the white man?

53:32.320 --> 53:34.709
He had an arrow through his head.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.952
<i>Ohl That girl huggin'me?</i>

53:38.960 --> 53:41.918
<i>Oh, that was my nurse</i>.

53:42.080 --> 53:45.038
<i>What I did was donate</i>
<i>my beautiful body to science</i>.

53:45.200 --> 53:48.510
<i>She was there to make sure</i>
<i>all the parts were there</i>.

53:50.400 --> 53:53.198
<i>Hurry up, I'm expecting a calll</i>

54:01.440 --> 54:03.670
What are you lookin' at?

54:03.840 --> 54:05.831
Nothin'.

54:07.840 --> 54:10.400
What? Look at that.

54:13.800 --> 54:18.351
<i>You've seen the sideshow</i>.
<i>She's the dogface girl</i>.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.518
Way to go, Caroline.

54:25.680 --> 54:28.558
Take aim, baby.

54:33.360 --> 54:35.590
Whoa. Beautiful.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.749
Ten grand.

54:43.240 --> 54:46.232
- They'd choke on the truth.
- The union?

54:46.400 --> 54:49.870
They get so used to lying
they can't do anything else.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.671
Stay outta the gutter!

54:56.920 --> 55:00.754
You know what, man?
There was something in the safe.

55:00.920 --> 55:04.674
- I kept a notebook.
- I thought you threw all that out.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.031
I kept the notebook cos
it had something funny in it, man.

55:10.200 --> 55:12.111
- Like what?
- Well...

55:12.280 --> 55:14.840
- Zeke, it's your turn.
- Coming at ya!

55:15.000 --> 55:19.437
- If you get a spare, we go ahead.
- Have no fear, Zeke is here.

55:21.400 --> 55:25.393
- Arlene, I'll get you a Seeing Eye dog.
- Thank you very much.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.280
He's so goddamned slow.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.795
At least we get out once in a while.

55:33.960 --> 55:36.190
Otherwise, they just go out and drink.

55:55.160 --> 55:56.957
Don't you aim at all?

55:57.120 --> 55:59.953
What are you talkin' about?
That had a curve to it.

56:00.120 --> 56:02.634
I'm setting 'em up for the bet.

56:02.800 --> 56:06.076
I have a new technique.
It's called radar.

56:13.240 --> 56:16.471
Jesus Christ, Jerry,
you been holding out, man.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.995
I guess it's up to me. It's up to me.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.276
It is up to you, it's up to you.

56:21.440 --> 56:23.351
What was in the notebook?

56:23.520 --> 56:26.876
A list of loans,
and they weren't regular loans, man.

56:27.040 --> 56:30.669
They were like shark loans.
You know what I mean?

56:30.840 --> 56:33.957
All had high rates of interest. High.

56:39.520 --> 56:41.511
We better tell Smokey.

56:42.760 --> 56:45.320
You know this ain't no big deal.

56:52.840 --> 56:55.149
Smokey, man, look.

56:55.320 --> 56:58.357
You saw this shit, man.
This is illegal loans, man.

56:58.520 --> 57:02.559
This... I checked with
Michigan National Bank, Smokey, right?

57:02.720 --> 57:06.429
They don't charge no
fucking 15% interest a month.

57:06.600 --> 57:08.875
No bank does in the worid.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.749
- OK, so it's illegal.
- You're goddamn right.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.275
Illegal enough
to send motherfuckers to jail.

57:15.440 --> 57:18.671
If we get this to the senate...
You seen them on television?

57:18.840 --> 57:22.389
The senate investigation shit.
This is what they talking about.

57:22.560 --> 57:25.711
- There could be a few dollars in it.
- What do you mean?

57:25.880 --> 57:28.269
He means we got 'em by the balls.

57:28.440 --> 57:31.671
Right? We got 'em by the balls
like they always had us, man.

57:31.840 --> 57:35.150
Ain't that right? Remember
the government guy that we met?

57:35.320 --> 57:37.038
He was talking about this book.

57:37.200 --> 57:39.998
We can get Eddie Johnson,
Dogshit Miller,

57:40.160 --> 57:42.469
Clarence Hill,
all them motherfuckers out!

57:42.640 --> 57:46.918
We take this to the next union meeting.
We bust the motherfuckers wide open.

57:47.080 --> 57:49.992
Holy shit. We're in trouble now.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.955
What the fuck you talking about?

57:54.120 --> 57:55.917
They're gonna be after us!

57:56.080 --> 57:58.548
- What you talking about?
- Pope couldn't save us.

57:58.720 --> 58:02.190
Man, this is the deal. We can change
the union with this book, baby.

58:02.360 --> 58:05.636
Fuck that, Zeke!
We gotta get rid of this book.

58:05.800 --> 58:08.030
Get rid of it as soon as possible.

58:08.200 --> 58:10.953
- What the fuck are you doing?
- My book too.

58:11.120 --> 58:13.111
- It isn't your book.
- What you mean?

58:13.280 --> 58:15.840
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.877
What the fuck? I suppose you do?

58:23.200 --> 58:25.270
Why do you go to the line every Friday?

58:25.440 --> 58:27.237
I have to hear this shit?

58:27.400 --> 58:30.039
Why do you go to the line every Friday?

58:32.440 --> 58:36.228
Because the finance man is gonna be
at your house on Saturday, right?

58:36.400 --> 58:40.996
- Shit, yeah.
- That's exactly what the company wants.

58:41.160 --> 58:44.516
They'll do anything
to keep you on their line.

58:44.680 --> 58:47.877
They pit lifers against new boys,
old against young,

58:48.040 --> 58:51.237
black against the white,
everybody, to keep us in our place.

58:51.400 --> 58:53.550
I mean, can't you understand that?

58:53.720 --> 58:58.111
Say, man, what the fuck you talking
about? This book is the place keeper.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.396
The book?

59:00.560 --> 59:05.509
Politics don't change shit. It's the
money that makes the difference, man.

59:05.680 --> 59:08.194
How the fuck's money
gonna make a difference

59:08.360 --> 59:10.874
to bust Clarence Hill
and them motherfuckers?

59:11.040 --> 59:15.192
You're trying to hurt somebody instead
of helping yourself! That's the problem!

59:15.360 --> 59:19.273
I got a problem now, man?
What the fuck, you a analyst?

59:21.680 --> 59:24.877
All right, so how do we help ourselves?

59:25.040 --> 59:28.476
- Blackmail.
- Black...

59:28.640 --> 59:32.474
That's right. They want that book.

59:32.640 --> 59:36.838
Let them pay us the $10,000 they want
from the insurance company

59:37.000 --> 59:40.993
and believe me, it's
"screw them and hooray for us" time.

59:41.160 --> 59:43.913
Smoke, you know,
you been to penitentiary, man.

59:44.080 --> 59:46.799
You know about this shit, right?
All right.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.996
How in the fuck we gonna
get 'em to do that?

59:49.160 --> 59:51.879
Take a page, Xerox it,
get it to Eddie Johnson.

59:52.040 --> 59:55.828
Tell them if they want it
to take an ad out in the press.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.472
- What if the motherfuckers don't pay?
- Then we'll cut 'em a new asshole.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.996
You should be done with that.
You're behind schedule.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.993
My mother would put you guys to shame!

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.391
- You should have been done with this!
- I'm doing my best.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.551
Hey, utility man.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.632
Smokey! Smokey!

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.396
I need another man in car seats.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.438
- What happened?
- Two guys are on sick leave.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.875
One passed out,
he's gone for the day.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.679
What you're telling me, man, is
I gonna be doing the work of three men?

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.674
Yeah, but I got faith in you, baby.
We depend upon you.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.116
Guys like you make this place work!

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.191
Come on, get on up there.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.635
You motherfucking goddamn dogshit...

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.119
I don't want it loose.
The last one came off.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.113
Come on, lard ass. You take up
more room than an elephant.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.558
Don't watch me, just watch your work.
Get this thing in. Hook up these wires.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.393
Hey, boy, did you pick cotton this slow?
Come on, let's move it.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.232
That's nice, honey.
Move it, Zeke. You're always dragging.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.834
- Get off my case!
- Watch it, Zeke.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.312
- Get off my case, man!
- Watch your lip or you'll be out

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.550
and I'll dock you for a full day's pay.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.995
You a redneck, peckerwood motherfucker.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.038
That's it, you're through!
I've had your bullshit!

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.430
I'm gonna kill the motherfucker!

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.797
- Super! Super!
- Super, my ass!

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.190
- I've had it with you!
- You pussy!

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.556
Fucking jerk off!

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.154
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Who heard it?

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.359
- Not me. I didn't hear shit.
- I didn't hear shit, either. Asshole.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.159
- Zeke! Let's go!
- Are you kidding me?

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.676
- In the green room. Come on!
- Son of a bitch.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.877
All right. Now, what's the problem?

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.508
I do my job,
can't nobody say no different.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.559
I was my own man when I came here
and I'll be my own man when I leave.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.472
Which will be soon.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.518
There's a line,
and you two guys ought to be on it.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.990
It sounds like an everyday
misunderstanding to me.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.359
Now, Zeke'll buy Miller a bottle of
Cutty and we'll forget all about it.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.479
Zeke ain't buying nobody a goddamn
thing, and you ain't shit for a steward.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.200
- You don't belong in this union!
- You're right!

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.909
You hear that, Clarence? You can't even
keep your own man in line.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.595
Is the union gonna give us a hassle
when we get rid of him?

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.675
The union takes a hard line on firing.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.992
- Eddie Johnson will want a hearing.
- Let's call him up!

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.153
I'll tell you one thing,
nobody threatens a foreman.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.959
- Bullshit!
- Look, it's really not that serious.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.759
Things just got a little out of hand.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.320
What do you say, Zeke?
You see a way out of this?

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.838
Dogshit hassles me a lot.
I should be compensated for that.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.275
Miller will buy Zeke the Cutty,
and we'll all go back to work.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.431
OK?

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.438
- OK.
- Good. Then it's all forgotten.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.716
Shake hands, let's go to work.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.475
It ain't personal, Zeke.
It's just my job.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.918
If it's forgotten,
ain't nothing to shake about.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.390
That's right.
Let's get back to the line.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.112
- I got a bottle of Scotch.
- Son of a bitch.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.838
You did the right thing.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.958
If I didn't have 18 years,
I'd have did the same thing.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.998
- Shit and fall in it, Barney.
- What?

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.591
You're a fucking hypocrite.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.911
The man wants to fuck somebody,
you drop your goddamn pants.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.196
- Well, I ain't letting him fuck me!
- Huh?

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.511
"Huh," my ass! What would you do
if the man got on your ass? Huh?

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.955
- I'd kill him.
- You'd kill him, my ass!

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.429
You'd do anything
to protect your 18 years.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.875
Your 18 years
ain't more important than mine!

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.156
Your wife ain't
more important than mine!

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.392
Your kids ain't no more
important than mine!

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.233
Jesus Christ!

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.392
It ain't even you I'm mad at!

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.836
I'm sorry, Barney. This fucking place...

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.753
Shit!

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.079
Hey, lighten up, little brother!

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.838
- This ain't no time to get funky, man.
- I ain't shit.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.991
Now, be with this.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.560
I read the paper today, man,

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.156
and the union,
they're ready to pay the bread.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.950
We gonna be rich, man!

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.596
Let's settle down.
You boys take a seat.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.594
The whole thing, they're going to pay
the whole ten grand?

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.036
I've never seen that much money.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.668
That's over $3,000 apiece, at one time.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.351
I don't think we better sit together.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.556
All right, let's settle down.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.473
You boys, come in and take a seat
so we can get started.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.790
How much
money was there, Clarence?

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.394
Well, there was a little over $20,000.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.429
- $20,600, to be exact.
- Wait a minute, $20,000?

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.875
What's the union doing
with so much cash?

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.919
We were just holding it temporarily.
It's for local 644's strike fund.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.798
Somebody must have known.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.555
Why don't you protect your money?
The papers said the safe was open!

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.759
- Now, that's not exactly right.
- All right, sit down.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.719
It wasn't our money.
It was your money.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.155
They stole your money!

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.437
Now you're talking.
How we gonna get our money back?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.352
Well, it was insured.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.114
Insured?
What about the dudes that did it?

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.840
Well, the cops'll find 'em.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.356
Police Department owes
this union some favours.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.229
We're standing outside
the AAW local 291 union hall.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.790
We see them coming out now,
and perhaps we can talk to one or two.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.758
Find out what they know.
Here's a man. Pardon me, sir.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.956
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Thank you.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.634
Perhaps we can get another opinion. Sir?

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.236
Son of a bitch. Shit, I don't know.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.278
I'll tell you something.
We're the workers at the plant.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.512
The managers are just there
to oversee us, you know...

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.832
You know something? I think we gotta
start talking about that switch.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.560
You know what I mean?

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.280
Let's go to the bar.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.912
- Jesus!
- No, no, no.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.868
- Who is he?
- My name's Charlie T Hernandez.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.349
- Smokey knows who I am.
- Right.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.876
- You owe me some money.
- Look, Charlie.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.191
Don't believe any of that shit
you read in the papers.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.079
This is just an insurance scam
created by the union.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.037
I don't want to hear no stories.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.909
- I just want my grand.
- But man, we've got something else!

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.435
Stuff that the union
will pay money for.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.352
Then you'll get your grand.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.159
Yeah, just give us
a couple of weeks, man.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.231
What kind of stuff?

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.631
- Illegal loan lists...
- Just stuff, bullshit, Charlie.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.995
I would tell you if it wasn't bullshit.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.711
OK.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.395
Smoke and me go way back,
so I'll give you a couple of weeks.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.313
Smoke always pays his bills.

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:23.596
Charlie, the union said
they're gonna give us the money,

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.638
but I mean, like, what if they don't?

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.917
You'll find it. You'll find it
even if you gotta sell this car.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.674
You know that, don't you, Smoke?

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.669
Yeah, I know that, Charlie.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:12.198
I can't believe the union
raised the insurance claim $10,000.

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:14.953
- I don't fucking believe it.
- That's $20,000.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.839
They're gonna pay us ten
and then make ten. Fuck 'em.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.993
We ought to charge 'em the same amount
they charging the insurance company.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.118
- Playing softball, Jerry?
- Yeah, 9:00.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.035
This thing, man, is turning into...

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.953
- How're we gonna get the bread?
- I don't know, man.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.031
I thought you had it all figured out.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.952
What am I, a fucking genius?

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.635
You know how difficult it is
to make a fucking switch?

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.870
Could we get a locker
at the bus station?

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.715
- They'll spot us hauling the bread.
- Not if they're afraid of the book.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.872
That's one thing we gotta think about.
How badly do they want that book?

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.191
This is what we gotta figure,
you know what I mean?

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.112
Tear the book up in half.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.831
We give them half, and when they give us
the money, we give 'em the other half.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.751
This ain't gonna fucking work, man.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.435
Smokey, it'll work.
We can get a post-office-box key.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.639
This ain't what I'm talking about, Zeke.
We can't be seen with each other.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.395
They know three guys did it,
two of them black, one white.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.110
- So what?
- We can't be seen with each other.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.589
We gotta talk by phone from now on.

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.399
It's dangerous,
hanging out with each other.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.755
We can't do this, understand me?

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.037
If anybody asks,
we never hung out with each other.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.317
This is the end.
We gotta go our own way now.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.157
That's too bad.

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.352
Arlene's gonna miss the bowling.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.034
Shit, she couldn't bowl, no how.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.230
Well, take care, man.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:17.075
Fuck.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:22.394
Hey, wanna beer?
Wanna beer? Fuck fate.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.795
Take it easy.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.113
I think you made a mistake, Hernandez.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.034
We found a Harrington
and Richardson.32 in the hall.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.228
Ballistics said it was the gun that shot
a police officer three weeks ago.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.197
He's still in the hospital.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.991
Hey, man, you know I wouldn't have
anything to do with a shooting.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.310
Do we?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.838
OK, so it don't look good. All right.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.274
What can I trade?

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.513
- What do you want to know?
- Whatcha got?

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.355
- I got three nobodies.
- So?

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.638
So, three nobodies got caught in
something bigger than they can handle.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.916
Union stuff.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.789
Something so big
you'll have to hush it up.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.469
This one's a union man.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.949
He'll buckle under a little pressure.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.076
Now, this one, he's hungry.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.152
He wants to get his hands
on the controls.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.913
Now, this bastard is a two-time loser.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.631
He'll make us pay through the ass
forever then fuck us for the fun of it.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.439
- Here, Smoke.
- Thank you.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.789
Well, my daddy said,
when I was little,

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:29.236
"When you get big, work hard
so the foreman can't say nothing."

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.755
"But, don't sweat."

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.639
How you gonna do it without sweat?

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.438
- Beer?
- And a Scotch.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.990
- Two beers and a Scotch straight up.
- Straight up?

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.555
- Where's the john?
- In the rear. Use my name.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.756
Yeah, you'll get a good seat.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.389
Hello. Mrs Bartowski?
This is telephone repair service.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.790
Is your husband at home?

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.999
Have you had a problem with your line?

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.436
There must be some mistake. Thank you.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.358
He's at the service station,
his wife's at the house.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.877
- You know how to get there?
- Use Hamtramck on Raymer.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:51.674
So he said, "Zager, I never seen you
put in a full week." Absentee.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.718
- What?
- "You only ever put in four days."

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.589
And Zager says, "Cos
I can't support my family on three."

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.677
- Arlene!
- <i>Yes?</i>

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.876
- This is Smokey James.
- <i>Oh, hi</i>.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.238
Hi. Arlene, did you just
get a telephone call?

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.358
<i>Yeah, from the phone company</i>.
<i>They made a mistake</i>.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:14.990
Yeah, I know, I was trying to get you
and your line was busy.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.749
What do I hear, the kids in the back?
Are the kids at home, Arlene?

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.708
- <i>No, why?</i>
- Oh, nothing.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.954
Jerry asked me to call. He's split
his pants down at the station house,

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.476
and he wants you
to bring down an extra pair for him.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.950
- <i>Oh, OK</i>.
- OK? He's kind of embarrassed.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.838
How are you doing? You all right?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.434
- <i>I'm fine</i>.
- Good. Well, I'll see you around.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.592
<i>- OK</i>.
- OK.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.635
Mrs Bartowski?

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.430
You giris looking for somebody?

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.068
I think we just got the wrong house.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.916
No, man. You didn't get the wrong
house, you just got the wrong time.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.072
- We wasn't gonna do nothing.
- Lying son of a bitch!

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.434
Wait a minute, man.
Come on, let's talk.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.273
- I want to know who sent you.
- Nobody!

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.749
- Who sent you?
- We got the wrong house!

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.673
Don't give me that fuckin' shit.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.877
Tell me who the fuck sent you. You gonna
tell me what I want to know, man?

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.749
You motherfucking coon, I'll kill you!

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.911
- I'm running out of patience.
- No more, brother, no more.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.036
Fuck you mean,
"No more, brother"?

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.749
I want to know who sent you, man.
Gimme a name.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.957
You know he's not gonna walk no more.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.315
Who sent you?
Who sent you, man?

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:59.233
- Who the fuck sent you?
- Some union guy, I don't...

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.312
What fucking guy?
Who the fuck sent you, man?

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.598
It was some guy who runs for...
for Eddie Knuckles. For Eddie Knuckles.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:12.796
Eddie Knuckles. Well,
that's name enough, isn't it, man?

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.112
I've been watching you
for some time, Zeke.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.555
You remind me of me when I was young.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.669
A little rough, a little pushy,
you talk too much, but you got guts.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.276
Just the right kind of guy to stand up
for the working man's rights.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:39.878
We've thought about what you and some
of the others said about Clarence Hill.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.315
We think you're right.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:47.474
So Clarence Hill's going to be
transferred to a new plant in Ohio.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.838
And I'd like you to fill in for him
till the next election.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.117
The job pays $17,400 a year.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.875
Can we cut the bullshit?

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.759
It's about time.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.993
I hear you got something I want.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:11.996
Yeah, but I want assurances that
nothing will happen to Jerry or Smokey.

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:16.915
Course. They're union men. We'll
protect their life and their safety.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.435
Don't con me. I want your word.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.955
Well, you've got it.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.430
Are you still interested
in that rep job?

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.870
I wanna be able
to make some changes.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.395
How much power am I gonna have?

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.757
- How much can you handle?
- All you got.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.354
Then you have it.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.034
Now this is for real.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.794
This is a hard-ass outfit.
We don't take slackers.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.235
I ain't no slacker.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.271
Good.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:58.709
Utility man! Where's that fuckin' horse?

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.717
Utility man! Utility man!

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.029
Utility man! Utility ma...

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:11.149
Hey, Smokey, the super says he needs
a utility man down in paint room three.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.950
Something about a car being fucked up,
and he wants you to fix it. OK?

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.156
- I can be with it.
- Thank you.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.111
Zeke, them cocksuckers
came into my fuckin' house!

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.915
What's gonna happen?
I'm getting scared.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.914
Will you shut the fuck up, man?
Ain't nothin' to worry about, OK?

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.311
They didn't come to your fuckin' house,
they came to mine.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:44.519
Charlie T's been cooled out.
We don't have to go to the cops no more.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.589
What are we going to do
about the notebook?

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.751
Jerry...

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.832
I'll take care of it.
We'll talk about it later.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.872
What are we gonna do about it now?
That is the question.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.198
Take it easy.
We'll talk about it later tonight.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.276
- OK?
- Later.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.399
You mean he's the one
that's gonna take your place?

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:26.269
- Zeke is gonna be the steward?
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.830
That's just the way things go down.

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.238
Hey, who the f...

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.470
Who the...

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.279
Who left that lift out there?

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.111
Let me out of here!

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.591
Zeke?

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:36.951
- You motherfuckers lied to me.
- Huh?

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.873
You said Smokey and Jerry would be OK.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.031
What the hell are you talking about?

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.829
I'm talking about Smokey.
I'm talking about his death!

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.437
We've been having meetings all morning.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.513
And we found out that James' death
was the result of negligence

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.114
and improper safety precautions.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.236
Fuck that, man! You had him murdered!

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.070
You be damn careful
who you call a murderer, Zeke.

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:07.312
What in the fuck do you call it, Eddie?

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.678
I'm going to give you a quick education,
son, and you better listen good.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.073
When I was your age, there were no
blacks working in the auto plants.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.071
- No blacks...
- Eddie...

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:24.837
Blacks gotjobs because guys like me
knew when to stand up...

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.037
and when to look the other way.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:32.910
I coulda talked to Smokey. I coulda
fixed it if you'd gave me a chance!

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.991
You didn't have to have him killed!

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.628
Now, come on, Zeke, wake up, will you?

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.517
How the hell do you think
things get changed around here?

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.353
Not by pie-in-the-sky martyrs!

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.828
Nothing's gonna happen to you, Zeke.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.788
You just thought that
being a union rep was going to be easy.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.478
Now you know, it's tough and it's rough.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.552
You know, I thought you had guts.

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.238
<i> There goes the "K,"and the ebony</i>
<i>genius has won another game of Scrabble</i>.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:12.119
<i>Hold on, J. J</i>.
<i>There's no such word as a "snerk."</i>

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.428
<i>- Yes, there is. It's a ferocious flea</i>.
<i>- I never heard of a dog having snerks</i>.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.878
<i>Michael, they don't get on dogs</i>.
<i>Snerks are from Africa</i>...

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:25.191
Could you turn that down, honey?
Daddy's trying to work.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.955
<i>- You'rejust making that up</i>.
<i>- Hey, check it outl</i>

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.753
Arlene, come here a minute.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.718
...<i>get a well-deserved rest</i>.
- Am I good, Daddy?

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.917
You're beautiful, sweetheart.
You really are.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:46.758
- Honey, go practise in your room.
- OK.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.112
I thought you were going to go to
Manistee to see your mother.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:59.910
That was this fall.
We didn't go. You changed your mind.

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:04.631
I been thinking about it.
Maybe you ought to go. Take the kids.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.678
What are you talking about?
The kids are in school.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.759
I want you and the kids
to get out of town.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.275
You'll take the Greyhound
in the morning.

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:16.759
Jerry, what's going on?

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.357
Something funny with the union.
I don't think you should be here.

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.798
Does this have anything to do with
Smokey James's death?

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.632
Yeah.

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:38.391
Listen, Zeke, we both know
Smokey was murdered.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.597
It wasn't no fucking accident
like the company says.

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.230
What are we going to do about it?

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.834
Nothin'.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.116
Nothing can help Smokey now.

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.236
Our friend's been killed, Zeke.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:57.233
We have to expose the union,
like you said.

01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:01.552
- It's not that simple, man.
- What do you mean?

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:05.315
We can't expose the union
without going to jail ourselves.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.189
Maybe we can make
some kind of deal with the FBI guy.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.351
What's his name? Burrows.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.830
How're we gonna live to tell about it?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.391
- What about the notebook?
- Things have gotten complicated.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:25.680
- It is not that simple anymore.
- You mean, you don't have the notebook?

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:31.198
I mean there's gonna be some changes
in the union. Big changes.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:35.394
I'm taking over Clarence Hill's job.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.120
I'm gonna be the new shop steward.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.351
Jesus.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.954
You gave it to them.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.634
Dennis, get your ass out of the street.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.153
We're playing, Dad.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:55.039
I don't give a fuck.
Get outta the street.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.915
It wasn't illegal anyway, man.

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:04.516
Well, illegal, but not illegal
in the sense that we know.

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:10.038
It's big business, man. The union loans
money to people in Vegas and New York.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:14.432
They charge a high interest rate.
Never miss one payment.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.034
That's how it's done, man.

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:26.719
You dumb asshole. You think those
bastards will let you change anything?

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.997
They just bought you off
with a promotion.

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:32.754
No, they think they bought
me off with a promotion.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:36.833
What they bought is a stick of dynamite.
I'm gonna raise hell.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.230
What about Smokey?

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.073
Dogshit Miller's gonna be fired
for negligence.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.994
That don't mean shit!

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:51.630
Man, who in the fuck are you kidding?
This is fuckin' for real.

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:54.189
Do you think it's better
for me to go to jail

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.396
or maybe let my family get killed?

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.190
For Smokey who's already dead?
Ain't nothin' gonna bring him back.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.716
I'll stay out here free.
Maybe I can make some changes.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.073
Jerry, with this union rep job, man,

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:12.710
it's a club in my hands.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:17.149
You're my friend, Jerry,
but you're thinking white.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:21.355
What the fuck does that mean?

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.909
It means that you got
more chances than I got.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.676
You're always gonna have more chances.
I got one chance and I'm gonna take it.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:31.400
I'm black.
The police ain't gonna protect me.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:35.348
Six months after this thing's over,
I'll end up back where I started,

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:38.159
living in some ghetto,
up to my black ass in bills,

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.108
wondering what night they'll come in
and kill the kids, Caroline and me.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.795
If I gotta kiss ass,
I'm gonna pick the ass I'm gonna kiss.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.555
And it ain't gonna be the police,
cos they'll shit in my face.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:52.632
Was Smokey white?

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.677
Man, you don't know the deal, do ya?

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.912
You think I'm crazy?
You want revenge? You got a gun?

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.799
You go out lookin' for killers
cos damn if I am.

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.958
Look, man, at least this way,
inside the union,

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.076
maybe I can make some changes.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.515
Fuck changes.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:13.433
Who are you kidding?

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:19.359
The union gets the notebook,
you get promoted to a softjob.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.034
OK, you get the chance
to change things.

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:26.272
But what do I get?
What about my family, Zeke?

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.352
Why is your family
more important than my family?

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.718
Jerry, there ain't nothin' in the worid
I wouldn't do

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.757
to protect my babies and my wife.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.679
Now, you gotta take care
of your own family.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.718
You're a worker, man. I'm a worker.

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:47.192
Let's work together. They need
a new foreman to take Miller's place.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:49.635
I can get you the job.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.670
I get screwed.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.116
That's all I know.

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.629
You ought to think about it, man.

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:25.513
- Hello, Bartowski.
- Hello.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:31.432
Well, the shit's really coming
down. I suppose you know that.

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.359
The Detroit Police don't keep secrets
too well. This is a company town.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:47.592
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I could've prevented all this.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:49.512
I had nothing to do with that.

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.593
You can still help us get the case
against the union. It's murder now.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.514
I got nothing to sell.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.559
I stole a notebook, heard conversations,
saw an industrial accident.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:05.518
Two guys can back me up.
One's dead, the other's a rep.

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.468
Just tell us everything you know.
We'll piece it together.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.597
- What do I get out of it?
- A suspended sentence.

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.751
How do I protect my family?

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.673
You got no choice.
I'm the only friend you got.

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:28.072
I'm the only one who can protect you
or your family.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:31.869
Maybe I'll go to Canada.
Can't be any worse there.

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.518
They'll find you wherever you go.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.513
- I can take care of myself.
- Oh, yeah? Can you?

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.753
Face it, you're one man, all alone,

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.514
and your friends
aren't going to help you now.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.313
I won't help you, Burrows. I'll let them
kill me before I turn stoolie.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.631
Oh, yeah? Who are you kidding?

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:08.352
I dedicate this drink
to all alcoholics at General Motors.

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.909
How about a bourbon, Joe?

01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:19.434
How'd Zeke get to be rep?

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.639
Yeah, they've got us these days, pal.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.917
He's sure enjoying it, that's for sure.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.999
<i>Operator</i>.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.720
I'd like to place a long-distance call,
collect.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:02.955
Area code 616-582-3976.

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:06.032
<i>- Thank you. Who's calling?</i>
- Jerry Bartowski.

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.309

<i>Will you accept charges?</i>

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:13.629
<i>Yes</i>.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.031
- Arlene, it's me.
<i>- Turn that down, Debby. How are you?</i>

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.668
- How are you?
<i>- Fine</i>.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.038
- Is there anything unusual?
<i>- Like what?</i>

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.829
Salesmen, or guys hanging around,
or anything like that?

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.719
<i>- No</i>.
- Where are the kids?

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.192
<i>- They're here</i>.
- Listen, don't let them go out alone.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.591
<i>What's wrong, Jerry?</i>

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.275
- I think they're following me.
- <i>Who?</i>

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.636
I'm the only one left
that knows what went down.

01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:51.476
About the notebook, the loans,
Smokey's death, how Zeke got his job.

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:53.471
Everything will be OK when I'm dead.

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.679
- <i>Where are you now?</i>
- In the bar. I'm afraid to go home.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.718
<i>Call the police right now</i>.

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:04.077
I'm not a brave man.
I can't take them all on alone.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.071
<i>Can't you get a job like Zeke did?</i>

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.117
Yeah, but I don't trust them.

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.556
<i>Just keep quiet</i>.
<i>Then won't they leave you alone?</i>

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.790
I don't see how they can do that.

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.038
- Don't move!
- Don't shoot.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.351
Get out of the car!

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.476
I want... I wanna confess a robbery.

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.471
You got to hear your rights first.

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:37.791
I want to talk to an FBI man
named John Burrows.

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:40.110
It's about a murder.

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:42.273
Check the torque
on the steering gear bolt.

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.476
Get these lines clipped.

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.268
It needs rail car tie-ons.

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:53.393
Keep this line movin'.
This ain't no floor show!

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.074
That ain't nothing special to look at.

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:08.713
Hey. Big man.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.954
Shithead's gonna sing like a bird.

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.554
- The son of a bitch.
- Zeke's coming.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.828
Tell 'em I'm gonna turn it off downtown.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.913
Hey, scumbag.

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.595
I'd sure hate to be living
in them pretty little white shoes.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.830
I see they finally fixed your locker.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.072
Nobody said you men could stop workin'.

01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.232
You'll see him in court.

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:11.517
No, it's all right.
Let me talk to the new steward.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.877
Yeah, let him tell me
about how he likes the workin' man.

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.508
You care about nothin'
but your own Polack ass.

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.434
Hey, blood, you double-crossed me.
Tried to get me killed.

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.070
I ain't your blood, motherfucker!
You do anything to stay out ofjail!

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:26.878
Even sell out on your friends.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.076
I ain't the one that sold out, you are!

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:31.151
Yeah, you jive honky?

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:35.472
You ain't looking out for nobody but
number one. That's you, jive white boy!

01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.278
You ain't nothing, you nigger.

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.477
I hope your parents protect your ass,
cos you'll have to hide!

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:42.551
- Fucking nigger!
- Motherfucker!

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:44.233
Kill him!

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.789
