Oh, just bring it, man.Yeah, all right. Bring it.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.439
Mm-hmm.Whenever you're ready, Ray.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.136
Take it you weren't
hearing any,

40:00.180 --> 40:02.748
uh, any footsteps
out there, huh?

40:04.010 --> 40:07.448
May have heard a few.

40:07.492 --> 40:09.450
That gonna be a problem?

40:09.494 --> 40:13.367
No. Not with my brothers
around me.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.414
Wolf's only as strong
as the pack, right?

40:16.457 --> 40:18.590
I got a strong pack.

40:18.633 --> 40:21.157
I got a strong pack.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.335
You ducking me, Quinn?

40:25.379 --> 40:27.337
Eh, you know,

40:27.381 --> 40:30.384
just being, uh, mindful
that we're still on the clock.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.559
Trickier than we figured,
isn't it?

40:31.603 --> 40:33.474
[chuckles]
Well,

40:33.518 --> 40:35.694
neither of us joined the Navy
'cause we liked easy.

40:42.570 --> 40:45.747
[clears throat]
All right. Listen up, everyone.

40:45.791 --> 40:46.966
[whistling]

40:47.009 --> 40:48.881
I got some important
business to deal with...

40:50.317 --> 40:52.667
...regarding Bravo 1's future.

40:56.279 --> 40:58.456
Seems that Master
Chief Hayes has

40:58.499 --> 41:00.283
a lot more doors to kick down.

41:00.327 --> 41:02.503
He's decided to reenlist
for two more years.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.592
[cheering]

41:04.636 --> 41:05.506
All right!

41:08.814 --> 41:10.468
Sure you're good, brother?[chuckles]:
I'm good.

41:10.511 --> 41:11.643
Always here for you.

41:11.686 --> 41:13.253
I know you are.CLAY: Hey.

41:13.296 --> 41:14.646
Yeah?

41:14.689 --> 41:16.125
All in all the time.
Right, boss?All the time.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.824
You know, for centuries,
servicemen and women

41:18.867 --> 41:21.653
have answered the call of duty
in national defense.

41:21.696 --> 41:23.263
And nothing more
solemnly affirms

41:23.306 --> 41:25.395
one's commitment
to that duty

41:25.439 --> 41:27.746
better than the enlistment
oath of office.

41:27.789 --> 41:32.402
Taking on this incredible burden
by sacrificing one's livelihood

41:32.446 --> 41:34.230
and potentially
one's life freely,

41:34.274 --> 41:37.495
without mental reservation
or purpose of evasion.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.976
Attention to orders.

41:41.020 --> 41:45.764
Master Chief Hayes,
raise your right hand.

41:45.807 --> 41:49.942
Repeat after me: I do solemnly
swear to support and defend

41:49.985 --> 41:51.944
the Constitution of
the United States...

41:51.987 --> 41:55.556
I do solemnly swear
to support and defend

41:55.600 --> 41:58.341
the Constitution
of the United States...

41:58.385 --> 42:01.040
ERIC:
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

42:01.083 --> 42:04.391
JASON:
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

42:04.434 --> 42:07.568
ERIC:
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

42:07.612 --> 42:11.050
JASON:
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

42:11.093 --> 42:12.660
ERIC: And that I will obey the orders

42:12.704 --> 42:14.575
of the president
of the United States.

42:14.619 --> 42:15.794
And that I will obey the orders

42:15.837 --> 42:17.752
of the president
of the United States.

42:17.796 --> 42:20.668
ERIC:
And the orders of the
officers appointed over me...

42:20.712 --> 42:23.453
And the orders of the officers
appointed over me...

42:23.497 --> 42:24.759
...according to
regulations...

42:24.803 --> 42:26.587
...according
to regulations...

42:26.631 --> 42:28.807
...and the Uniform Code
of Military Justice...

42:28.850 --> 42:31.287
JASON:
...and the Uniform Code
of Military Justice.

42:31.331 --> 42:33.594
So help me, God.

42:33.638 --> 42:36.597
So help me, God.

42:36.641 --> 42:39.469
[cheering, applause]
