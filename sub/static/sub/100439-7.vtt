00:04.588 --> 00:06.381
Someone has taken control
of the Masked Man.

00:06.465 --> 00:08.634
A non-playable character
has become playable.

00:08.717 --> 00:11.220
First, he was giving out
thousands of dollars in loot.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.598
Then he killed me,
which he's not supposed to be able to do.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.184
And now he's disappeared.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.561
This has never happened before
in the history of gaming.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.189
Yeah. Pretty awesome, huh?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.608
-What?
-"Awesome"?

00:25.359 --> 00:28.529
No. Ian, it is not awesome.
We've been hacked.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.865
People's personal information,
their credit cards, their passwords.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.159
-They've all been compromised.
-Nobody cares about that.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.036
-It's not a big deal.
-It is a massive deal.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.162
How do you not understand?

00:37.246 --> 00:40.082
Hundreds of corporations
have been hacked in the last few years

00:40.165 --> 00:41.500
-and no one gave a shit.
-Name one.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.043
Equifax.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.711
-Name another.
-Target.

00:45.838 --> 00:46.964
-Name another one.
-PlayStation.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.048
-Name one more.
-Yahoo.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.132
-Another.
-Marriott.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.259
-One more.
-eBay, Uber,

00:50.342 --> 00:52.761
Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield,
Home Depot, Facebook.

00:52.845 --> 00:54.137
Goddamn it. Fine. We get it.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.682
UPS, Chase Bank, Tumblr, LinkedIn, AOL.

00:56.765 --> 00:57.891
Ian.

00:57.975 --> 01:01.645
People don't care about privacy.
What they care about is a good story.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.313
A good story? What are you talking about?

01:05.107 --> 01:07.484
Maybe this breach
is a golden opportunity for us.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.320
It's a classic story
between good and evil.

01:11.488 --> 01:15.158
This could be the biggest event
in the history of Mythic Quest.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.494
This could be the end of Mythic Quest.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.666
David's right. This could be the end
of Mythic Quest. This is a huge deal.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.918
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.212
-You just said it wasn't a big deal.
-Yes.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.673
-Now you're saying it's a huge deal?
-Yes.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.552
Am I crazy? You just argued the exact
opposite point, like, 30 seconds ago.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.763
That's what being a leader is. You have
to go a thousand miles in one direction,

01:36.847 --> 01:40.100
then on a moment's notice, turn on a dime,
come back the opposite direction.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.685
Then everybody else must adapt.

01:41.768 --> 01:46.565
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
That is completely right. Or wrong.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.483
You see, we're all on the same page.
Or we're not.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.068
What is happening here? What is this?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.362
Ian and I are obviously seeing eye-to-eye,
and you're not.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.072
That's why I'm over here and you're there.

01:54.156 --> 01:58.243
I might change my mind in 35 seconds,
and then he's gonna have to adapt to that.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.328
-I pivot.
-See?

01:59.411 --> 02:02.164
Okay. You know what? Do whatever you want.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.542
Just do whatever you want.
Or, minutes later, do the exact opposite.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.586
I don't care anymore. This place is in--

02:09.377 --> 02:10.964
This place is ins--

02:11.590 --> 02:13.467
Oh, you're doing the coughing thing again?

02:13.550 --> 02:17.054
You got a cough? You gotta cough over--
You know what? This place is insane.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.890
-Can we do my plan?
-Yeah.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.436
"Pivot." I'll show you pivot.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.819
Hi. I'm just trying to reach Dan Williams.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.196
If I can leave a message--

02:34.821 --> 02:36.865
Oh, Dan, it's you. Hi.

02:36.949 --> 02:41.245
Well, in that case, I accept your offer.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.249
Oh, it's Poppy. It's Poppy Li.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.334
Yeah, no, I did think I said that.

03:03.892 --> 03:04.935
Boom!

03:05.727 --> 03:09.398
Bye-bye, boss man.
You just got your ass kicked by Wyld_D.

03:09.481 --> 03:13.735
Fifty-two subscribers?
Why are you so boring?

03:14.528 --> 03:16.029
The Blazing Blade...

03:16.113 --> 03:18.031
You're not even
looking at the right camera.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.534
...of Maximum Immolation, lation, lation.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.743
What?

03:21.827 --> 03:22.828
Sick, right?

03:23.245 --> 03:27.332
That's it for me today. The next person
to subscribe gets a shout-out.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.337
Please, dear God,
pick a camera and stick with it.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.547
Anybody?

03:40.721 --> 03:41.805
Pathetic.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.308
Okay. That's fine.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.727
Oh, my God!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.188
Wyld_D.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.608
Hey. Caught the feed.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.152
So you're the one person watching.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.945
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.280
I feel like a failure.

03:58.906 --> 04:02.034
Hey, come on. You didn't fail.
You're just new at this.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.119
You know, loosen up a little bit.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.371
Talk to them like you talk to me.
You know?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.458
And this lipstick, it's just--
It's not you, you know?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.835
And where are your cute glasses you wear?

04:11.919 --> 04:15.047
Brad told me not to wear them.
He says they're too dorky.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.632
Yeah, they're dorky, but so are you.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.259
You know? That's why it's perfect.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.553
Just be yourself and people will find you.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.722
You got this.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.196
The tension was thick.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.407
You could hear a pin drop.

04:42.491 --> 04:47.704
And then Ian turns and he looks at us
in the eye, and he says--

04:48.580 --> 04:52.501
Ian says, "I agree with David."

04:54.002 --> 04:57.214
Wow. I wish I could have seen that.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.007
Or anything that happens upstairs.

04:59.091 --> 05:02.636
You guys have such fun. I wish
I could see some of that or daylight.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.680
So I ask him-- I told him--

05:04.763 --> 05:06.473
To do a livestream, you know?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.392
Get out in front of it.
Apologize to the players.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.603
Assure them their data is safe.
Just nip it in the bud.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.897
That's what you gotta do, man. You know?
End it immediately.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.607
Well, that is such a relief.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.319
You know, I am so glad that you
reassured our players,

05:19.403 --> 05:22.114
'cause, you know,
they're gonna be pretty steamed

05:22.197 --> 05:24.825
that their personal information
was compromised,

05:24.908 --> 05:28.704
which I understand 'cause I have been
doxed many times by our players.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.582
-I don't know how they get my social--
-Sue, the livestream's about to start,

05:31.665 --> 05:34.459
so maybe we could just cue it up
on the computer there and...

05:35.752 --> 05:40.591
Now, get ready to watch
the great Ian Grimm dance to a little tune

05:40.674 --> 05:42.885
written by Maestro David Brittlesbee.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.765
Good morning. As some of you
have no doubt noticed,

05:49.183 --> 05:50.642
the Masked Man has been acting strangely.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.769
He's been interfering with gameplay,

05:52.853 --> 05:55.606
pillaging loot
and disappearing altogether.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.857
You're probably wondering,

05:56.940 --> 06:00.360
"Why would Mythic Quest do this
to one of its most beloved NPCs?"

06:00.444 --> 06:03.280
Now, that's a fair question.
And it's time that you knew the truth.

06:04.531 --> 06:08.160
We are no longer in control.
We've been hacked.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.454
And I'm not gonna lie to you.
They got everything.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.207
It's bad. Real bad.
But that's not what's important.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.376
What is important
is that I have a message to deliver

06:16.460 --> 06:19.213
to whomever has taken control
of the Masked Man.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.468
Fight me.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.972
"Fight me"?
Oh, that is a good line, maestro.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.517
-That's not my line.
-That's right. I challenge you to a duel,

06:31.600 --> 06:32.726
whoever you are.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.146
If I win, you will relinquish control
of the Masked Man.

06:36.939 --> 06:41.401
But if you win, you will have defeated me
at my own creation.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.861
What is he doing? What is he doing?

06:42.945 --> 06:46.406
You will become the alpha of Mythic Quest,

06:46.907 --> 06:50.494
and I will be but a lowly beta bitch.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.539
At least I don't have
to rein him in anymore.

06:53.622 --> 06:57.417
If you want to prove you're not a coward,
meet me Friday, 8:00 p.m.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.212
at the coliseum in
the Masked Man's Hall of Games and Chance.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.089
Oh, shit. Casino plug.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.632
-No, no, no.
-Masked Man,

07:03.715 --> 07:05.551
I will see you on the battlefield.

07:06.260 --> 07:10.013
This ends here. Grimm... out.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.974
Ian's gonna fight the Masked Man?

07:12.391 --> 07:14.101
Cool ending. How'd you come up with that?

07:14.184 --> 07:17.479
I didn't. He did. Without me.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.358
Alas, I'm tasting the bitter hemlock...

07:22.609 --> 07:24.319
of betrayal.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.904
This is a total nightmare.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.616
Yup. Yeah, that's Montreal.
That's Montreal calling.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.869
-Wow. You get bars down here?
-Hell, what do I say to them?

07:31.952 --> 07:35.080
Oh, the last time that
my phone number was published online,

07:35.163 --> 07:37.708
I just went to my sister Jackie's
for a couple days, you know,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.376
until the whole thing blew over.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.170
Watched Dancing with the Stars
a bunch. So--

07:41.253 --> 07:43.130
I don't have a sister Jackie.
I don't have a brother.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.716
I grew up an only child.
It was a very lonely existence.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.634
So I don't have anyone to call.

07:47.718 --> 07:48.760
Shit.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.685
I've defeated you, Masked Man.

07:56.768 --> 08:00.439
And now
I will reveal your identity to the world.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.941
Hold up. Why are you being so nice to him?

08:03.025 --> 08:05.402
It's supposed to be a noble moment.
You want me to call him names?

08:05.485 --> 08:09.072
Yes. Yeah, call him a sex pest.
That's a big insult in Australia.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.575
I don't think he's gonna be Australian,
but I appreciate the enthusiasm

08:11.658 --> 08:12.826
and I love the term.

08:12.910 --> 08:13.911
-It's good, right?
-Yeah.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.746
Ian, what are you doing?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.664
Oh, hey, Jo. We're making a cutscene

08:17.748 --> 08:20.501
for the big moment
when I reveal the Masked Man's identity.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.086
Yeah, I can see that.
Why are you doing it with her?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.838
Hi, Jo! How's it lookin'?

08:24.922 --> 08:28.467
Weird and unnatural and against God.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.843
Maybe we should swap out.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.970
-No, actually, it's feeling pretty good.
-Yeah.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.639
You know what? Could you grab me a water?

08:33.722 --> 08:34.932
Unbelievable.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.058
What is going on?

08:36.140 --> 08:38.602
Ian replaced me
with that Australian sex pest.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.102
-Ian?
-Hey, Dave!

08:40.562 --> 08:42.563
Hey, just wondering,

08:42.648 --> 08:44.733
I saw that you challenged a cyber criminal
to a fight.

08:44.816 --> 08:48.570
And just wondering if you thought
about the ramifications of that.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.113
What happens if you lose and whatnot.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.824
-Yes, I don't think it would go very well.
-No.

08:52.908 --> 08:55.994
I would probably be humiliated
in front of millions of people,

08:56.078 --> 08:57.955
and it would ruin my reputation.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.706
And I might even lose my job.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.584
Yeah. But, David,
you're not seeing the upside here.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.419
Oh, I'm not? I'm sorry, Poppy.
What's the upside?

09:04.503 --> 09:06.338
The upside is that if he wins,

09:06.421 --> 09:08.757
he's gonna look like even
more of a hero than he already does,

09:08.841 --> 09:11.134
which I thought was impossible,
and yet here we are.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.636
It's not impossible. It's not impossible.

09:12.719 --> 09:16.098
I'm loving this new Poppy. I don't know
what's going on, but I'm diggin' it.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.850
Poppy, you're supposed to be
the reasonable one.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.852
Yeah, I'm tired of being reasonable.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.896
Today, I decided to jump
on the crazy train. Honk-honk!

09:23.230 --> 09:24.648
That's a truck, you stupid--

09:24.731 --> 09:28.235
Jo. Jo. I got this. Okay?
I've got this under control.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.655
Have you lost your fucking minds? Okay?

09:31.738 --> 09:34.992
We have an unknown entity
in our system, leaving us vulnerable.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.076
We have to shut this guy down--

09:36.159 --> 09:38.120
David,
if we're gonna find and track this hacker,

09:38.203 --> 09:40.289
then we need him to sign on again
as the Masked Man.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.874
He hasn't logged in in days.

09:41.957 --> 09:45.210
Ian's plan is actually a pretty smart way
to get him to do that.

09:45.294 --> 09:48.005
And besides,
I never get to do fun stuff like this.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.425
No one ever wants to cap my mo. It's fun!

09:54.219 --> 09:55.220
Jesus Christ.

09:55.304 --> 09:58.348
That is if he logs in.
Why would he announce himself like that?

09:58.432 --> 10:01.977
I'm banking on the fact that this guy
probably has a massive ego.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.146
Like a big enough ego
to where he would agree

10:04.229 --> 10:06.190
to do something as stupid as this
in the first place.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.611
And he doesn't even see the irony
of what he just said. It's fucking wild!

10:10.694 --> 10:14.072
Do you understand that this
could be the end of Mythic Quest?

10:14.156 --> 10:16.867
Or it could launch Ian
into the stratosphere,

10:16.950 --> 10:19.328
making him the god
he already assumes himself to be.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.205
-She gets it.
-It's just bananas.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.290
-Hey! Pop, I'm lovin' it.
-Hey!

10:23.373 --> 10:25.334
-We're gonna take this asshole down!
-Let's do it.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.544
You're not even his assistant!

10:27.628 --> 10:30.088
Jo. Jo. I have this, okay? I have this.

10:30.172 --> 10:33.091
Oh, great. Montreal.
That's Montreal calling.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.427
Ian? Can you please talk to corporate

10:35.511 --> 10:37.513
and let them know I have
nothing to do with this thing?

10:37.596 --> 10:40.015
David, I don't do phones anymore.
I haven't held a phone in six months.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.391
Yeah, not anymore? Okay.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.853
He doesn't do phones, David.
What the fuck?

10:44.937 --> 10:46.813
Great. I got it. I got Montreal.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.359
Jo. I need you-- Jo? Jo!

10:50.442 --> 10:54.488
Hey. So speaking of being
good at the game, you are, right?

10:55.531 --> 10:57.783
-What do you mean?
-You're good at playing the game.

10:57.866 --> 10:58.867
Of course I am.

10:58.951 --> 11:02.079
Pop, I'm not one of those creative
directors who doesn't play his own game.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.582
I can beat anyone, anytime, any--

11:06.083 --> 11:07.918
-Fire rain!
-Fire rain!

11:08.001 --> 11:10.337
Gnome is defeated.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.715
How are you so bad at this?

11:13.799 --> 11:17.177
Pop, it's just
this shitty gnome character. It sucks.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.680
Where's the white knight avatar
with my face on it that you promised me?

11:19.763 --> 11:21.223
I am making him.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.600
But you're not ready for him.
You have to earn him.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.561
Let's go again. But this time, no magic.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.229
That fire rain spell is way too OP.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.898
The fire rain spell was your idea.

11:29.982 --> 11:34.820
You woke up from a nap,
came to a meeting, said, "Fire rain."

11:35.529 --> 11:39.157
Then you walked out the door,
and I spent several weeks implementing it.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.410
That is ringing some bells.

11:41.493 --> 11:44.371
And it is a very cool spell.
But I don't wanna play with it, all right?

11:44.788 --> 11:48.458
In the vanilla version,
we had a dagger and a loincloth, you know?

11:48.542 --> 11:49.543
And that's what I crushed at.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.503
For someone who loves vanilla so much,

11:51.587 --> 11:53.463
you spend a lot of your time
coming up with toppings.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.091
I can't help it
when the ideas come to me, Poppy.

11:56.175 --> 11:58.468
They just sort of come, you know?

11:58.552 --> 12:01.013
Honestly, sometimes
it can get a little overwhelming,

12:01.096 --> 12:02.764
and I just wish that they would slow down.

12:02.848 --> 12:03.891
That's my own failing.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.019
Sure. Sure.

12:07.102 --> 12:08.979
You know what?
Usually, I hate this dynamic,

12:09.062 --> 12:10.564
but today I'm nostalgic for it.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.191
Why not? I'm gonna train you.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.736
I love it when you're bad at stuff.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.116
-Jo. Jo?
-What?

12:26.580 --> 12:29.666
-What the hell are you doing in here?
-Drinking.

12:29.750 --> 12:33.212
I have been abandoned
by my closest friend and collaborator,

12:33.962 --> 12:36.340
a man I would have been proud
to call my father.

12:36.757 --> 12:37.841
Yeah, and I--

12:38.342 --> 12:40.677
Wait, you think of Ian as a father?
That's weird.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.763
-That is weird.
-Because so do I.

12:43.597 --> 12:47.935
That is so disturbing and confusing on
so many levels for completely different--

12:48.018 --> 12:50.229
You know what?
I don't have time to get into it.

12:50.312 --> 12:52.189
Jacques and Jean-Luc
won't stop calling me.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.484
I need you to tell them that I'm too busy
handling the situation to talk.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.528
That'll buy me time
until I figure how to control Ian.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.738
-But you can't control Ian.
-I know that, Jo!

12:59.821 --> 13:02.032
But I don't want them to know that.
Do you understand?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.076
That's them. Okay, here. Answer it.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.410
You should do it, David.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.872
Otherwise, they're just gonna walk
all over you like they always have.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.458
This is your moment to support creative.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.837
You know what? You're right.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.507
Maybe I should stand up to them
and support creative.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.844
Or I could hide out here. Yeah.

13:21.927 --> 13:24.429
C.W., what are we drinking?

13:24.513 --> 13:29.268
Fortified port wine mixed with drip coffee
and three teaspoons of sugar.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.603
I call it the "Rutger Hauer."

13:31.687 --> 13:33.981
Goddamn it, why couldn't you just have
a normal drink, man?

13:37.484 --> 13:38.485
Bottoms up.

13:40.696 --> 13:41.905
-Okay.
-Press here. Hit.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.909
-Hey, Danimorphs, it's your girl, Wyld_D.
-Damn it.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.078
We got three days left
until the big fight, y'all,

13:48.161 --> 13:50.289
and I am pumped. Who's gonna win?

13:51.081 --> 13:52.165
I wanna hear from you.

13:52.249 --> 13:55.169
Vote in my poll below or chat it up.
I want to see your comments.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.549
Yes. That's better.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.093
Okay, personally, my money's on Ian

14:03.177 --> 14:05.387
because I hear his fight camp
is top-notch.

14:06.805 --> 14:07.848
Damn it!

14:10.434 --> 14:11.602
Damn it!

14:20.861 --> 14:23.780
It's gonna be a tough setting
for the fight.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.659
There's no terrain for cover, so they're
gonna have to fight fast and dirty.

14:27.743 --> 14:28.869
Don't take my shoe!

14:28.952 --> 14:31.205
The question is, is he gonna show?

14:31.580 --> 14:34.958
We haven't heard or seen
from the MM since the gauntlet was thrown.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.420
Will this be the greatest live event
in MQ history?

14:38.504 --> 14:39.671
The glasses are working?

14:39.755 --> 14:42.132
Or will the mysterious hacker
never return?

14:42.216 --> 14:43.884
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

14:45.219 --> 14:47.346
Hey, can I get another controller, please?

14:47.429 --> 14:50.224
Bring all the controllers!
Just all of them!

14:56.772 --> 14:57.898
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.192
Less than 24 hours until the big day,
y'all.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.194
-Yes, yes, yes, keep going here.
-Strike, strike.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.698
-That was better though, right?
-It was so much better.

15:06.782 --> 15:07.783
Let's go again.

15:07.866 --> 15:12.329
The anticipation is killing me. Okay?
I cannot sleep.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.290
And the way you've all been lighting up
my comments section,

15:15.707 --> 15:17.793
I can tell I'm not the only one.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.838
Strike. Head strike.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.382
-Body blow. Strike.
-No, no, no.

15:27.511 --> 15:29.888
-Yes!
-Gnome is victorious.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.723
Yes! I did it! I murdered you!

15:31.807 --> 15:34.268
-You murdered the shit out of me!
-Oh, my God.

15:37.396 --> 15:41.316
-Am I ready?
-Yeah. You're ready.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.203
Brazzah! Happy fight night.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.622
Hey. You seem abnormally happy.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.666
Ian's doing something reckless and stupid.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.293
Usually you'd be trying to stop him.

15:59.376 --> 16:03.172
Ian's gonna do what he's gonna do,
and I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do.

16:03.255 --> 16:05.757
Well, the good news is
the player numbers are through the roof.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.385
Not just new ones.
Older accounts have been renewed.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.971
I mean, Ian was right.
People love this story.

16:11.054 --> 16:14.308
So if he wins, this could be the biggest
day in the history of the game.

16:14.391 --> 16:17.269
Or he will lose, and we will be
the laughingstock of the gaming industry.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.062
Either way, hoot-hoot!

16:19.146 --> 16:20.564
You're happy. You're confident.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.649
-Is it because you think Ian's gonna win?
-Sure.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.818
-Okay. You wanna bet on it?
-Yeah. Okay.

16:24.902 --> 16:26.236
Not money. Hair.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.699
-You want my hair?
-It's not for me.

16:31.742 --> 16:32.951
Let's just do money.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.246
Fine.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.750
Should I report that?

16:41.585 --> 16:42.586
Hey.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.507
Hey, Pop. I just watched the new
wire-frame for the unmasking

16:46.590 --> 16:48.675
and it is going to blow them away.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.177
-You ready to catch this asshole?
-Yep.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.388
As soon as he logs on,
I should be able to get his IP address.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.933
Then I just cross-reference
with our online services

16:56.016 --> 16:57.893
so I can identify his user account.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.187
If there's a vulnerability in his system--

17:00.270 --> 17:02.606
Then we will be triumphant.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.649
Yeah.

17:04.733 --> 17:08.028
But you know what
the best part of this has been?

17:08.111 --> 17:09.112
What?

17:09.694 --> 17:11.865
You and me doing it together.

17:13.242 --> 17:16.328
Old Ian and Poppy,
you know, like the old days.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.329
No fear, no anxiety.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.415
You were happy.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.377
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I was.

17:27.798 --> 17:31.385
So, Poppy Li, did I earn my white knight?

17:32.553 --> 17:35.222
Yes. I finished him this morning.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.728
He's the most sophisticated
character rig I've ever made.

17:41.812 --> 17:46.441
Complete with AI-trained animation cycles.
So, try not to get him disemboweled.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.069
Anyway... it's done.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.531
Fuckin'-A, it is.

18:12.551 --> 18:13.969
It's fight day, guys.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.890
Ian Grimm has entered the arena,
and it looks like he is ready to rumble.

18:17.973 --> 18:21.101
It's a winner-take-all battle
between Ian and the Masked Man.

18:21.185 --> 18:23.270
And the crowd is going nuts.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.439
Unmitigated tripe.

18:25.856 --> 18:28.901
A mob of imbeciles
witnessing a slapdash tale

18:28.984 --> 18:30.694
and applauding its thoughtless ending.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.238
Cheer up, C.W. When
the Masked Man's identity is revealed,

18:33.322 --> 18:34.865
everyone's gonna care because of you.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.074
Wrong.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.870
The pacing is ruined.
There's no dramatic through line.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.123
And no matter who he turns out to be,
it won't be compelling,

18:43.207 --> 18:45.584
because we have
no emotional attachment to him.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.211
Or "her." It could be a woman.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.047
Don't kick me while I'm down.

18:50.130 --> 18:53.509
Thank you all for being here
on this momentous occasion.

18:53.592 --> 18:56.178
And I'd also like to say
thank you and welcome

18:56.261 --> 18:58.305
to the millions of Mythic Quest fans

18:58.388 --> 19:00.766
from around the globe
who are watching online.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.810
Now, normally, I am one for speeches.

19:04.311 --> 19:07.022
But today, I came to fight.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.398
Yeah!

19:09.149 --> 19:11.026
Yeah! You the man, Ian!

19:14.029 --> 19:15.656
Love you, Ian!

19:40.430 --> 19:41.932
Let's do this.

19:48.522 --> 19:52.234
And now the wait is on.
Will the Masked Man show?

19:52.901 --> 19:55.654
Oh, God. They're calling again.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.656
Come on, David. Just answer it.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.742
If Ian wins, you'll look like a hero
for backing creative.

20:00.826 --> 20:03.495
Don't you see, Jo?
I'm finished either way.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.874
I've lost control of the situation.

20:06.957 --> 20:10.919
Masked Man, come forth and face me.
Or did you lose your spine?

20:18.802 --> 20:20.429
Holy shit. It's him.

20:21.430 --> 20:22.472
Yes.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.732
Well, hello, Masked Man. Welcome.

20:34.026 --> 20:38.280
Hello, Ian Grimm.
Ready to lose everything?

20:38.363 --> 20:41.450
I knew you'd show. Let's end this.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.495
And here we go!

20:46.246 --> 20:49.082
Get ready to taste the steel of my blade,
Masked Man.

20:49.166 --> 20:52.711
The sorcerer's fire of Mordoff
shall burn your flesh for eternity.

20:53.128 --> 20:54.421
For Mythic Quest!

20:54.505 --> 20:56.632
Sic semper tyrannis!

20:57.549 --> 20:59.551
This is the dorkiest bullshit
I've ever seen.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.641
Ian takes it to the Masked Man first!

21:08.519 --> 21:11.980
Combo after combo after combo!
Beat his ass!

21:18.779 --> 21:21.365
Holy shit. That was pretty good.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.086
How the hell did the Masked Man
charge his ult so fast?

21:35.587 --> 21:40.300
Oh, shit. Ian, no, he has access
to the entire spell-casting tree. Ian!

21:46.515 --> 21:48.851
-Shit.
-This is not gonna be good.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.979
-Activate Kyanite Shield. He's gonna use--
-Fire rain.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.704
Had enough, Grimm?

22:12.291 --> 22:14.835
Ian is only seconds away
from being embarrassed

22:14.918 --> 22:17.045
on the biggest stage of his own game.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.218
All right. You know what? Screw this.

22:33.562 --> 22:34.563
What is he doing?

22:34.646 --> 22:39.776
Ian's white knight is dropping all
of his weapons? Is this on purpose?

22:39.860 --> 22:42.154
You may be able to defeat me
with your special armor

22:42.237 --> 22:43.989
and your high-powered spells, Masked Man,

22:44.323 --> 22:46.408
and you may call that a victory.

22:46.742 --> 22:47.951
But to me,

22:48.035 --> 22:53.248
the truest, purest form of Mythic Quest
has always been this.

22:56.043 --> 22:57.669
What are you doing?

22:57.753 --> 23:00.506
-I'm gettin' buck naked.
-Why?

23:01.340 --> 23:05.260
Oh, shit! He gone vanilla style.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.347
Ian is down to nothing but a loincloth.

23:09.348 --> 23:11.600
And there goes the loincloth.

23:15.604 --> 23:18.607
I can beat you in any style, Grimm.

23:18.690 --> 23:22.444
I can't even believe what I'm seeing.
The Masked Man is stripping down too.

23:22.528 --> 23:24.613
-What is happening?
-This is amazing.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.535
You're supposed to take off
your loincloth too.

23:29.618 --> 23:32.120
-I'm not doing that.
-Come on. The crowd will love it.

23:32.204 --> 23:34.039
-No. It's weird.
-It's not weird. It's primal.

23:34.122 --> 23:36.041
Why would I wanna be naked
in a knife fight?

23:36.124 --> 23:38.126
-So you're scared.
-Scared really has nothing to do with it.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.670
Whatever. Let's just get on with it.

23:40.546 --> 23:42.089
This is some caveman shit.

23:59.356 --> 24:02.442
I've tracked him down. Holy shit.

24:02.526 --> 24:04.069
Ian, I got him.

24:07.990 --> 24:10.868
-He's gonna do it.
-Cut his fucking heart out, Dad!

24:23.046 --> 24:24.089
Yes!

24:25.841 --> 24:26.884
Yes, Ian!

24:28.719 --> 24:30.470
-He did it!
-Yes!

24:33.182 --> 24:36.185
Yes! He did it! Yes! Yes, he did it!

24:37.728 --> 24:40.689
-He pulled it out of the old bag.
-He sure did.

24:40.772 --> 24:43.901
-Not such a twat after all.
-He really is though.

24:43.984 --> 24:47.613
What are you gonna do, David?

24:49.615 --> 24:51.617
It's time to pay the piper, I guess.

24:53.076 --> 24:56.079
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.083
-Bonjour.
-Don't "bonjour" me, you idiot!

25:00.167 --> 25:02.127
-Yes.
-How fucking stupid can you be?

25:02.211 --> 25:03.712
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry about that.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.339
I've actually been sick, so--

25:05.422 --> 25:07.382
What does Ian Grimm think he is doing?

25:07.466 --> 25:10.010
Yeah. And again, I'm sorry, 'ca--

25:12.721 --> 25:15.516
You know what? I'm not sorry.
And I'm not sick.

25:16.058 --> 25:18.685
In fact, you should be thanking me,

25:18.769 --> 25:22.981
because another executive producer
would have never allowed this to happen.

25:23.065 --> 25:24.733
But I did.

25:25.150 --> 25:29.905
I just oversaw the most historic day
in the history of MQ

25:29.988 --> 25:32.824
because I backed creative. My way.

25:33.992 --> 25:35.410
You know what I'm gonna do right now?

25:35.494 --> 25:37.621
I'm gonna go back,
and I'm gonna celebrate with my team.

25:37.704 --> 25:38.872
And if you don't like it,

25:38.956 --> 25:41.959
you can come down here
and you can French-kiss my dick!

25:44.962 --> 25:49.341
David, that was badass! I have
never heard you talk like that before.

25:53.095 --> 25:55.764
Jo, I believe that was
Rutger Hauer talking.

25:56.348 --> 25:57.391
Yeah.

25:57.474 --> 25:59.226
-Poppy, do you have him?
-I got him.

25:59.309 --> 26:00.310
Hit it.

26:03.021 --> 26:06.733
You have bested me.
I am not long for this realm.

26:07.442 --> 26:12.823
You fought valiantly, but now,
Masked Man, I reveal your identity!

26:20.581 --> 26:22.624
-Why is the camera on?
-Oh, my God.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.085
What the fuck? Hold up.

26:26.879 --> 26:28.672
Pootie Shoe's the Masked Man.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.966
Et tu, Poo-tay?

26:31.842 --> 26:33.051
I did not see that coming.

26:33.135 --> 26:36.471
Really? I did. So obvious.

26:37.181 --> 26:40.058
Cut the Wi-Fi router, Mom! Mom?

26:40.142 --> 26:42.936
He's not a little piece of shit.

26:43.896 --> 26:46.315
He's a huge piece of shit.

26:46.857 --> 26:47.858
Surprisingly brilliant.

26:47.941 --> 26:51.528
You know what? Fuck you, Grimm!
Fuck you all!

26:54.865 --> 26:57.034
That's gotta be
a pretty satisfying ending, right?

27:08.378 --> 27:10.297
Poppy! Poppy!

27:14.343 --> 27:16.094
What an amazing event.

27:16.178 --> 27:18.639
I want to thank
the hundreds of thousands of people

27:18.722 --> 27:23.435
that tuned in for the most epic day
in MQ history.

27:24.478 --> 27:25.562
Yeah!

27:27.773 --> 27:28.899
-Hey!
-Yeah!

27:30.526 --> 27:32.819
All right! Boom! Yeah.

27:38.575 --> 27:39.952
-Pop.
-This is incredible.

27:40.035 --> 27:40.994
Come on.
