(piano music)

00:54.717 --> 00:56.751
(women coughing and moaning)

01:09.164 --> 01:12.333
Ow! Dammit.

01:12.367 --> 01:14.435
(A woman screams.)

01:14.469 --> 01:17.305
(nurse crying)

01:17.339 --> 01:18.973
What is it?

01:19.007 --> 01:21.842
Ward C.

01:21.876 --> 01:24.311
Nurse Collins. I...

01:24.345 --> 01:26.346
(nurse crying)

01:26.380 --> 01:28.449
(dramatic music)

01:31.619 --> 01:33.954
- What's happening?
- They got out.

01:33.988 --> 01:35.856
- Who?
- The incurables.

01:53.341 --> 01:55.575
- (woman growling)
- (Julia gasps.)

02:09.844 --> 02:11.811
I'm coming in with you.

02:11.845 --> 02:14.547
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

02:18.819 --> 02:21.621
(woman): It's OK, baby. It's OK.

02:21.655 --> 02:23.623
- Yeah. Mommy...
- Rose,

02:23.657 --> 02:26.225
- get away from her.
- No.

02:26.259 --> 02:30.062
I need you to move away from
her. I need to help the nurse.

02:30.096 --> 02:32.331
I doubt you need that.

02:32.365 --> 02:34.699
She's dead, dear. Long dead.

02:34.734 --> 02:36.902
Then I really need you to step away,

02:36.937 --> 02:39.805
- Rose.
- Well, are you gonna do it?

02:39.839 --> 02:42.341
You said you were gonna tear her to pieces!

02:42.375 --> 02:45.209
There she is. (Woman laughing)

02:45.244 --> 02:47.412
- Ah!
- Haha!

02:47.447 --> 02:49.314
Get off of me!

02:49.348 --> 02:51.483
No, no, no!

02:51.517 --> 02:53.351
Ah...

02:53.385 --> 02:55.186
Lock her in her room.

02:58.023 --> 03:01.725
- Mr. Drainie! Mr. Drainie!
- Oh! Oh!

03:01.760 --> 03:04.929
- Are you alright?
- Ah! Ah! What happened?

03:04.964 --> 03:07.966
I was hit from behind.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.168
Where's Nurse Collins?

03:10.202 --> 03:13.104
She's dead, Mr. Drainie.

03:13.138 --> 03:15.206
Jean's dead.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.342
One of those monsters killed her.

03:18.576 --> 03:21.679
- And she did it with my knife!
- Don't touch that!

03:21.713 --> 03:25.649
I need you to escort
them all into their rooms.

03:25.684 --> 03:28.352
Why, thank you very much.

03:28.386 --> 03:30.354
It's so rare to have

03:30.388 --> 03:32.690
such gentlemanly behaviour these days.

03:32.724 --> 03:35.792
Will you be leaving soon?
My babies need their sleep.

03:35.826 --> 03:38.862
- They need the lights out.
- Hannah, can I come help?

03:38.896 --> 03:40.763
Of course, Girly.

03:40.798 --> 03:43.100
(Girly laughing)

03:43.134 --> 03:45.302
Of course.

03:45.336 --> 03:47.904
Thank you, Dr. Ogden.

03:47.938 --> 03:49.806
- (Girly laughing)
- OK, baby. We're OK.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.909
Shh, shh. Shh, shh...

03:52.943 --> 03:54.477
Miss Pearce.

03:54.512 --> 03:57.580
(door closing)

03:57.615 --> 04:00.884
Well, that was certainly more
exciting than most evenings in here.

04:00.918 --> 04:04.621
- Did you see anything?
- Of course not.

04:04.655 --> 04:08.324
And if I did...

04:10.260 --> 04:14.263
(thunderclaps)

04:30.780 --> 04:33.782
Can you have your staff
transfer her to Dr. Grace?

04:33.816 --> 04:37.686
Of course.

04:39.455 --> 04:42.323
How did they all get out of their rooms?

04:42.358 --> 04:44.625
I don't know.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.262
The guard on duty's name is Samuel Drainie.

04:47.296 --> 04:49.964
If the patients have
behaved themselves, they are

04:49.998 --> 04:53.101
allowed a half-hour free
time in the recreation room.

04:53.135 --> 04:55.370
After that, they are
locked up for the evening.

04:55.404 --> 04:57.404
And you locked in Rose Maxwell?

04:57.439 --> 05:01.141
I didn't have to. She has not been
allowed out of her room all day.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.143
She'd been just unusually agitated.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.112
- Unusually?
- (Door closing)

05:05.146 --> 05:06.814
(thunder growling)

05:06.848 --> 05:09.183
No more than usual, actually.

05:09.217 --> 05:13.687
Why take a knife into that ward?

05:13.721 --> 05:16.390
I've been attacked 4 times. Who wouldn't?

05:16.424 --> 05:20.660
I see. So, after locking
in the remaining patients,

05:20.695 --> 05:23.330
you checked to be sure Miss
Maxwell's room was secure?

05:23.364 --> 05:25.966
I've been doing this job for 15 years.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.336
There are very few duties to forget.

05:30.370 --> 05:32.371
All of the rooms are
locked with one common key?

05:32.406 --> 05:36.509
That's right, yes. And
the ward door as well.

05:38.345 --> 05:41.648
Well then, Mr. Drainie,
how did they all get out?

05:41.682 --> 05:43.382
I don't know.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.384
I heard a commotion, I went to respond.

05:45.419 --> 05:47.386
Nurse Collins was being attacked!

05:47.421 --> 05:49.388
And they were all out of their rooms?

05:49.423 --> 05:52.492
- I... I think so.
- You think so?

05:52.526 --> 05:56.362
A nurse was being attacked.
I didn't do a head count!

05:56.396 --> 05:58.931
(thunder growling)

05:58.965 --> 06:00.866
Oh, Mr. Drainie.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.935
Your lantern.

06:02.969 --> 06:06.438
Oh! Thank you.

06:08.374 --> 06:10.375
Hmm.

06:10.409 --> 06:12.477
It's possible he may have forgotten

06:12.512 --> 06:14.479
to lock one of the doors, but all of them?

06:14.514 --> 06:16.548
It's not likely.

06:16.582 --> 06:18.583
One of the patients could
have got hold of a key.

06:18.618 --> 06:22.254
Perhaps Rose Maxwell, the
one who killed Nurse Collins.

06:22.288 --> 06:25.323
- I'd like a word with her.
- So would I.

06:26.859 --> 06:29.394
Miss Maxwell has a serious
psychiatric condition.

06:29.428 --> 06:31.530
She's not responsible for her actions.

06:31.564 --> 06:35.033
Be that as it may, Julia. It
makes her no less dangerous.

06:38.904 --> 06:42.273
Rose, may we speak with you for a moment?

06:42.307 --> 06:45.543
Miss Maxwell, we need to
ask you some questions.

06:45.577 --> 06:47.745
How did you get out of your room?

06:47.780 --> 06:49.747
The door was open.

06:49.782 --> 06:53.003
- You're saying that you...
- Is that Detective Murdoch I hear?

06:54.117 --> 06:55.752
I want to speak with you.

06:55.787 --> 06:58.055
Only you.

07:10.534 --> 07:12.502
You finally come for a visit.

07:12.536 --> 07:14.537
You're not my patient, Rose.

07:14.572 --> 07:17.007
You remember the island, don't you, Julia?

07:17.041 --> 07:20.077
We had a gay time there.

07:20.111 --> 07:22.645
We're not here to talk about that.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.647
I wish I had killed you all.

07:24.682 --> 07:26.982
All of you congratulating that witch

07:27.017 --> 07:29.051
for taking my Cedric away.

07:31.388 --> 07:33.089
William.

07:33.423 --> 07:35.358
Miss Pearce.

07:35.392 --> 07:37.827
You're looking so well.

07:37.861 --> 07:39.762
How's married life?

07:39.796 --> 07:41.698
Has it settled into a dull routine yet?

07:41.732 --> 07:45.267
I find that is usually the
case, especially for the man.

07:45.301 --> 07:47.236
Thank you, Miss Pearce.

07:47.270 --> 07:49.839
I shouldn't be locked
up with these lunatics.

07:49.873 --> 07:51.540
William,

07:51.574 --> 07:55.044
I was just so distraught
when my fiancÃ© jilted me.

07:55.078 --> 07:58.714
I didn't know what I was
doing. I just lost my mind.

07:58.748 --> 08:01.383
If I could go back in time...

08:01.417 --> 08:03.151
Miss Pearce,

08:03.185 --> 08:05.887
I know that you are as sane as I am.

08:05.921 --> 08:08.957
No need to try to convince me otherwise.

08:08.991 --> 08:11.560
It is amazing what a good
lawyer can do for you, isn't it?

08:11.594 --> 08:15.429
Miss Pearce, I only need
to hear one thing from you.

08:15.464 --> 08:17.698
Did you or did you not see

08:17.733 --> 08:20.235
Rose Maxwell kill Nurse Collins?

08:20.269 --> 08:22.737
What would you like me to say?

08:22.772 --> 08:27.008
I can say anything you want.

08:27.042 --> 08:29.043
Good night, Miss Pearce.

08:31.046 --> 08:34.815
When I get out, I expect
you will be calling on me.

08:34.849 --> 08:36.817
Detective.

08:36.851 --> 08:39.052
Why did you kill Nurse Collins?

08:39.087 --> 08:41.188
I had the chance.

08:41.222 --> 08:44.057
- That's it?
- That was enough.

08:44.092 --> 08:47.928
- So, you admit to killing her?
- Of course.

08:47.962 --> 08:50.563
Julia, I liked that feeling.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.299
(Julia sighs.)

08:52.333 --> 08:54.434
- I had almost forgotten it.
- That's enough, Rose.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.904
And please...

08:56.938 --> 08:59.539
give my regards to Emily Grace.

09:02.343 --> 09:04.511
We're done here.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.046
Please lock the door.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.715
(Rose roaring)

09:08.749 --> 09:11.951
(Julia grunting)

09:11.985 --> 09:15.722
- (Murdoch): Get off of her!
- (Rose): YAA! You're next!

09:15.756 --> 09:17.924
- See that she's restrained.
- Yes, sir.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.826
(Rose): Ah!

09:19.860 --> 09:22.628
- Julia.
- (Rose): No!

09:22.662 --> 09:24.763
- (Julia gasping)
- Are you alright?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.966
- (laughing): Yes.
- Your arm?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.935
- (Rose): No! Enough!
- It's fine.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.737
(thunder growling)

09:31.771 --> 09:34.207
She was stabbed 11 times.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.609
No one could have survived the attack.

09:37.644 --> 09:40.813
- Rose is an extremely violent woman.
- I am all too aware of that.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.281
You know she still takes no responsibility

09:43.316 --> 09:45.283
for any of her actions on the island

09:45.318 --> 09:48.554
- or before?
- She murdered her family.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.824
She murdered her friends.
Who would want to face that?

09:51.858 --> 09:54.259
Now, she vows revenge on both of us.

09:54.293 --> 09:58.363
- Revenge for what?
- For surviving, I suppose.

10:00.499 --> 10:03.101
Do you... do you think,

10:03.135 --> 10:05.837
maybe, she should be transferred
to another institution?

10:05.872 --> 10:08.206
One further away from us?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.842
Emily, that's not necessary.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.244
An ax-wielding maniac
vows revenge on you...

10:13.278 --> 10:15.546
and me for that matter... and
you don't think it necessary?

10:15.581 --> 10:17.415
She's in custody.

10:17.449 --> 10:19.384
âª

10:19.418 --> 10:22.086
Alright. It's just a caution.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.888
Of course.

10:25.824 --> 10:28.625
Julia...

10:28.659 --> 10:31.028
there were bite marks on the body.

10:39.037 --> 10:42.072
(unsettling music)

10:59.690 --> 11:03.192
Rose?

11:03.227 --> 11:06.329
I need to speak with you.

11:06.363 --> 11:09.565
Rose!

11:09.599 --> 11:10.566
(screaming)

11:10.600 --> 11:12.568
Julia...

11:12.602 --> 11:14.337
(gasping)

11:14.371 --> 11:17.372
(thunder growling)

11:17.407 --> 11:20.142
Julia, is everything alright?

11:20.176 --> 11:22.044
It's nothing, William.

11:22.078 --> 11:24.413
Just an unpleasant dream.

11:24.448 --> 11:26.916
- Go back to sleep.
- Are you sure?

11:43.081 --> 11:45.181
<i>It was reported that all of the inmates</i>

11:45.215 --> 11:48.317
were out of their rooms when
Mr. Drainie entered the Ward.

11:48.352 --> 11:50.319
All except Eva Pearce.

11:50.354 --> 11:52.988
Apparently she remained in
her room during the commotion.

11:53.023 --> 11:54.823
And they just wander around free?

11:54.858 --> 11:56.825
Well, no, sir, not usually.

11:56.860 --> 11:59.728
You said the old bugger was forgetful.

11:59.763 --> 12:01.764
Yes, but I'm not inclined to believe

12:01.798 --> 12:05.367
- he forgot to lock every room.
- And no one saw anything?

12:05.401 --> 12:07.369
Well, there's no one
usually down there, sir.

12:07.403 --> 12:10.039
Mr. Drainie stops in once
an evening but that's it.

12:10.073 --> 12:13.042
Whose fingermarks are on the knife?

12:13.076 --> 12:15.578
George is working on that as we speak.

12:18.548 --> 12:20.949
Hey, look.

12:20.983 --> 12:23.085
- Constable.
- (Rose): Go away!

12:23.119 --> 12:25.320
Don't you have mine on file?

12:25.354 --> 12:27.322
Miss Pearce.

12:27.356 --> 12:29.458
Or did you just want to
get close to me again?

12:32.361 --> 12:34.662
You're very gentle.

12:34.697 --> 12:37.665
- (door closing)
- (woman): Come and see her.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.667
That's all, Miss Pearce.

12:39.702 --> 12:41.936
Hello, Constable Crabtree.

12:41.971 --> 12:44.906
- Mrs. Lynd.
- I do apologize

12:44.940 --> 12:47.541
for trying to kill you
the last time I saw you.

12:47.576 --> 12:51.078
- I misjudged you.
- Mrs. Lynd, we all make mistakes.

12:51.113 --> 12:53.447
I trust you're staying on
the right side of the road?

12:53.482 --> 12:54.881
- I am indeed.
- Good boy.

12:54.916 --> 12:57.251
- Good to see you, Mrs. Lynd.
- You too.

12:57.285 --> 12:59.620
- Oh well...
- Hush, I'm sure the constable

12:59.654 --> 13:01.655
will only be a minute.

13:01.689 --> 13:04.858
Constable, can you take Suzanne's as well?

13:04.892 --> 13:06.860
She would love you to.

13:06.894 --> 13:09.329
Uh...

13:09.363 --> 13:13.100
Yes, of course.

13:13.134 --> 13:14.901
(Brackenreid): What the devil is this?

13:14.936 --> 13:16.402
(phone ringing)

13:16.437 --> 13:19.339
Hard to say no to a child, sir.

13:19.373 --> 13:22.509
So all of their fingermarks
were on the murder weapon?

13:22.543 --> 13:24.710
Yes. All but Eva Pearce.

13:27.414 --> 13:29.482
We can't ignore the possibility

13:29.517 --> 13:31.684
that one of the other women
in the ward is the killer.

13:31.718 --> 13:34.220
What about Rose Maxwell's admissions?

13:34.255 --> 13:36.289
She's a deluded woman, Julia.

13:36.323 --> 13:39.626
- I have a duty to make inquiries.
- We have a duty.

13:39.660 --> 13:42.828
- William?
- She tried to kill you, Julia.

13:42.863 --> 13:46.032
- I'm not entirely comfortable...
- And I'm not a schoolgirl.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.269
(Murdoch sighs.)

13:50.303 --> 13:52.138
Miss Maxwell, you've been telling people

13:52.172 --> 13:55.240
that you killed Nurse Collins. Why?

13:55.275 --> 13:57.242
Because I did.

13:57.277 --> 13:59.978
Is it possible you might
be stretching the truth?

14:00.012 --> 14:03.215
No. I attacked her.

14:03.249 --> 14:05.984
- Did she struggle?
- She didn't have a chance.

14:07.987 --> 14:10.322
She was a tough old bird.

14:10.356 --> 14:13.491
I bit her and she didn't even squawk.

14:13.525 --> 14:15.493
And you're sure she was still alive?

14:15.527 --> 14:18.329
I certainly am.

14:22.068 --> 14:25.136
I must say I was glad to
see Nurse Collins dead.

14:25.171 --> 14:27.672
- Why?
- She was a cruel,

14:27.707 --> 14:30.341
spiteful woman.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.210
She would take my babies away from me.

14:32.244 --> 14:35.145
With the slightest provocation,
she'd just take them away.

14:35.180 --> 14:37.781
I love my babies.

14:37.816 --> 14:39.783
You picked up the knife? Why?

14:39.818 --> 14:42.420
Seemed a handy thing to have.

14:44.256 --> 14:46.223
I don't like to speak ill of the dead,

14:46.257 --> 14:48.491
but she got what she deserved.

14:48.526 --> 14:50.660
She was wicked,

14:50.695 --> 14:52.662
and the wicked are to be punished.

14:52.697 --> 14:55.465
His will was done.

14:55.499 --> 14:58.468
The murder of an innocent
woman was God's will?

14:58.502 --> 15:00.838
Oh-oh-oh, she was far from innocent.

15:00.872 --> 15:03.707
What did Nurse Collins do
that deserved to be punished?

15:06.944 --> 15:09.446
I can't say.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.349
- Mrs. Lynd...
- No. I won't say.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.401
You'll have to ask Charlotte.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.536
She was her favourite.

15:16.570 --> 15:19.205
(Julia): Did you see anything?

15:19.239 --> 15:21.740
I didn't. I was suffering

15:21.775 --> 15:24.110
from a migraine and they
can be terribly blinding.

15:24.144 --> 15:27.780
Charlotte, if you saw
something, you need to tell us.

15:27.815 --> 15:30.983
- I didn't.
- Don't lie to me, Charlotte.

15:31.018 --> 15:32.618
I need to know the truth.

15:32.652 --> 15:34.287
What happened?

15:34.321 --> 15:38.290
LEAVE HER ALONE! She said
she didn't see anything!

15:38.325 --> 15:40.659
Detective, may I have a moment?

15:43.296 --> 15:45.964
- Maddie?
- Yes?

15:45.998 --> 15:49.501
Were you holding the knife?

15:49.536 --> 15:51.637
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Why?

15:51.671 --> 15:54.906
To keep Rose away from Girly.
She's not all there, you know.

15:54.941 --> 15:57.809
Maddie...

15:57.844 --> 15:59.777
can I talk to Girly?

16:01.714 --> 16:03.949
Please.

16:03.983 --> 16:07.785
Girly, it's me. Dr. Ogden.

16:07.820 --> 16:10.221
Can I talk to you for a moment?

16:13.859 --> 16:15.827
Hello, Dr. Ogden.

16:15.861 --> 16:18.363
Hello, Girly.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.237
Haha!

16:20.272 --> 16:22.072
How are you?

16:22.107 --> 16:24.074
Good!

16:24.109 --> 16:26.543
Girly...

16:26.577 --> 16:29.179
do you know what Nurse
Collins did to Charlotte?

16:32.517 --> 16:35.085
Will you tell me?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.554
- I'll get in trouble.
- No.

16:37.588 --> 16:40.257
No, Girly, you won't. I promise.

16:43.628 --> 16:47.230
Nurse would come into
Charlotte's room at night

16:47.264 --> 16:50.266
and she would touch her

16:50.301 --> 16:52.636
in places she wasn't supposed to.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.005
Thank you, Girly.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.142
(soft laughing)

17:01.478 --> 17:04.512
Do you believe her?

17:04.548 --> 17:06.648
She's 3 years old.

17:06.683 --> 17:08.784
I don't think she would lie.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.520
Did she say anything else?

17:11.555 --> 17:17.526
Only that the nurse would touch
Charlotte in private places.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.395
I've asked to see all of the
files relating to Nurse Collins

17:20.430 --> 17:22.832
to see if I can find any corroboration.

17:24.534 --> 17:28.403
None of the others reported any violations.

17:28.438 --> 17:31.239
Maybe she didn't do it
to any of the others.

17:31.274 --> 17:33.175
Let's find out.

17:38.147 --> 17:40.915
I would offer you tea, but as you can see,

17:40.950 --> 17:43.218
my accommodations are somewhat sparse.

17:43.252 --> 17:45.653
- We don't care for tea.
- And what will you do for me

17:45.688 --> 17:47.289
if I answer your questions?

17:47.323 --> 17:50.124
You should be grateful
you still have your life.

17:50.158 --> 17:52.494
I told you, Detective,

17:52.528 --> 17:55.262
I will say and do whatever you want.

17:55.297 --> 17:57.499
Did you ever see

17:57.533 --> 17:59.634
Nurse Collins acting improperly

17:59.668 --> 18:01.636
around any of the patients here?

18:01.670 --> 18:05.772
- What would you like me to say?
- Did she molest anyone?

18:05.807 --> 18:08.142
I keep to myself.

18:08.176 --> 18:11.145
But if you would like me
to speak ill of the dead...

18:11.179 --> 18:14.581
This is obviously a waste
of everyone's time, Doctor.

18:14.616 --> 18:17.418
Just give me a moment, Detective.

18:17.452 --> 18:18.819
Eva.

18:18.853 --> 18:21.855
Rose Maxwell is a vicious killer.

18:21.890 --> 18:24.157
I doubt she needs a
reason to do what she does.

18:24.191 --> 18:28.028
She talks about it all the time, you know.

18:28.062 --> 18:31.264
She thinks you are the reason
she and Cedric aren't together.

18:31.298 --> 18:35.602
You threw her in here
and destroyed her life.

18:35.637 --> 18:38.871
What did Nurse Collins do
to make Rose attack her?

18:38.906 --> 18:40.873
She's getting bolder, you know.

18:40.908 --> 18:42.875
She's waiting for you

18:42.910 --> 18:45.045
to let down your guard, and when you do...

18:45.079 --> 18:47.046
Miss Pearce, why are
you trying to scare me?

18:47.047 --> 18:48.582
What do you think that's going to achieve?

18:48.682 --> 18:51.084
I'm not trying to scare you.

18:51.118 --> 18:54.119
I'm just letting you know
what I'm looking forward to.

18:54.154 --> 18:56.989
Because I know the reason I'm in here.

18:57.024 --> 19:00.026
You're here because you're a
murderer trying to evade justice.

19:00.060 --> 19:03.029
No, I'm here because you're scared of me.

19:03.063 --> 19:05.831
Have you seen the way
your husband looks at me?

19:05.866 --> 19:07.967
I'm sure you have.

19:08.001 --> 19:09.969
You may think he loves you,

19:10.003 --> 19:12.671
but you know he desires me.

19:14.674 --> 19:17.742
Perhaps I did misjudge
you. You're clearly deluded.

19:17.777 --> 19:20.312
Oh, am I? Once I get out,

19:20.346 --> 19:22.814
I'll show you who's the deluded one.

19:22.848 --> 19:24.349
Eva, you're never getting out.

19:24.434 --> 19:26.268
Ever.

19:26.302 --> 19:28.503
You're exactly where you deserve to be!

19:37.980 --> 19:40.181
I must confess I lost my temper.

19:40.215 --> 19:42.651
- Perfectly understandable.
- She may know the truth.

19:42.685 --> 19:44.652
She'll never surrender it.

19:44.686 --> 19:47.355
Doctor, why don't they let me see Rose?

19:47.389 --> 19:49.323
I was told you are not allowing
her to receive visitors?

19:49.358 --> 19:51.325
- That's true.
- Why?

19:51.360 --> 19:54.562
Because she killed someone, Mr. Maxwell.

19:54.596 --> 19:57.097
- Only yesterday.
- Who the devil are you?!

19:57.132 --> 20:00.934
Detective William Murdoch.
Toronto Constabulary.

20:00.969 --> 20:04.171
My sister would not kill
anyone without reason.

20:04.205 --> 20:07.041
Mr. Maxwell, I know from
first-hand experience what

20:07.075 --> 20:10.310
your sister can do. I was there
when she killed your fiancÃ©e.

20:10.344 --> 20:12.946
What was the reason there?

20:12.981 --> 20:16.516
Rose felt my marriage to
Lavinda would rend us asunder.

20:16.551 --> 20:18.785
She didn't want that.

20:18.819 --> 20:21.321
And that's a reason to kill someone?

20:21.355 --> 20:23.323
Rose felt Lavinda

20:23.357 --> 20:25.492
was a threat to her happiness.
That is why she killed her.

20:25.526 --> 20:28.428
- You excuse her actions?
- I understand them.

20:28.462 --> 20:31.364
Now, if I may, I would
like to see her, please.

20:31.399 --> 20:33.265
I'm sorry, Mr. Maxwell,
but I cannot permit that.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.401
- But I need to see her.
- Mr. Maxwell...

20:37.037 --> 20:39.672
... go home.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.347
How often does he visit?

20:48.381 --> 20:50.316
I don't know, William.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.590
- He never missed a day.
- That's unusual.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.526
A very devoted brother.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.894
Is there an address on file?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.833
- (man): Not mine!
- (second man): Hurry up!

21:07.867 --> 21:09.935
(third man): You like it here?

21:12.438 --> 21:15.540
Now, sir, this is where
Cedric Maxwell's been staying

21:15.574 --> 21:18.143
since his sister's confinement.
Previous to this, he had

21:18.177 --> 21:20.145
- a lovely house in Rosedale.
- What happened to it?

21:20.179 --> 21:22.747
Apparently he's spending every
penny trying to help Rose.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.882
Without much success.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.556
(door creaking)

21:31.590 --> 21:35.059
Oh... From Rosedale to this.

21:35.093 --> 21:37.828
I suppose the lawyers were
more dear than he imagined, sir.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.864
They always are.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.471
Letters from Rose, sir.

21:47.505 --> 21:49.874
Are we sure they were brother and sister?

21:49.908 --> 21:53.443
- Yes, George. Why?
- "I cannot bear to be apart."

21:53.478 --> 21:55.512
"I ache for you.

21:55.546 --> 21:57.514
At night I burn."

21:57.548 --> 22:00.884
Sir, hardly writing from
a sister to a brother.

22:00.918 --> 22:03.186
"I burn."

22:07.925 --> 22:09.959
Train tickets, sir.

22:09.994 --> 22:12.428
Cedric was to depart
with somebody last night.

22:12.462 --> 22:15.165
The same night his sister escaped her room.

22:15.199 --> 22:18.768
On a trip Miss Maxwell
was unable to take...

22:18.803 --> 22:22.005
in spite of her brother's best efforts.

22:24.612 --> 22:27.760
We haven't found Cedrix
Maxwell yet. But... we will.

22:28.216 --> 22:31.084
- I'd like to see those letters.
- Of course.

22:31.119 --> 22:33.453
It would appear that he slipped his sister

22:33.488 --> 22:36.923
a key to her room. We also
found 2 unused train tickets.

22:36.957 --> 22:38.892
He intended to flee the city.

22:38.926 --> 22:41.861
- So it would seem.
- (Children laughing)

22:46.299 --> 22:48.467
- (children laughing)
- Whoever knows the direction

22:48.502 --> 22:51.270
one's life will take?

22:51.304 --> 22:53.573
(woman): Yes, inside.

22:53.607 --> 22:55.574
Go inside.

22:58.311 --> 23:00.279
(woman): Remember the grapes?

23:00.313 --> 23:02.781
(man): I did, I did.
They're in the kitchen!

23:06.853 --> 23:08.754
Mr. Maxwell?

23:08.788 --> 23:11.457
âª

23:23.502 --> 23:25.470
Oh! Oh! Oh! (Cloth tearing)

23:25.504 --> 23:27.906
Oh! Ugh!

23:27.941 --> 23:29.740
Ah!

23:32.344 --> 23:34.679
Mr. Maxwell, we need to have a word.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.618
You have a filthy mind.

23:40.652 --> 23:44.055
The content of the
letters seems clear enough.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.725
Rose is my adopted sister.
We loved one another.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.994
And yet you attempted to marry another.

23:50.028 --> 23:53.097
I attempted to live in a way...

23:53.131 --> 23:55.600
that society deemed I should.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.002
It was a mistake.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.971
Rose could see that.

24:05.376 --> 24:07.344
Do you deny making this?

24:07.378 --> 24:10.914
It was found in your rooming house.

24:10.948 --> 24:13.950
I'm going to assume that it's
the key to your sister's ward.

24:13.985 --> 24:16.353
Do you deny that?

24:18.823 --> 24:21.024
Where did you get the
key to make this mold?

24:21.058 --> 24:23.793
That prison guard left it on his desk.

24:23.828 --> 24:26.830
Rose didn't deserve to be in there.

24:26.864 --> 24:28.932
We were going to leave the city,

24:28.966 --> 24:33.737
- start a new life.
- And yet she ended someone else's.

24:33.771 --> 24:36.539
- Why would she do that?
- She wouldn't.

24:36.573 --> 24:38.974
All she wanted to do was be with me.

24:39.009 --> 24:42.545
She wouldn't have risked
that by killing that nurse.

24:42.579 --> 24:46.149
She wouldn't have risked
losing that chance.

24:46.183 --> 24:48.751
She loves me.

24:51.587 --> 24:53.488
Rose...

24:53.523 --> 24:56.925
can I see the key your
brother Cedric gave you?

24:56.960 --> 24:59.394
He didn't give me anything.

24:59.428 --> 25:01.764
Miss Maxwell, your brother told me

25:01.798 --> 25:04.499
he gave you a key so you
could escape from this door.

25:06.469 --> 25:08.436
Rose?

25:18.514 --> 25:20.848
Thank you.

25:26.989 --> 25:28.823
It doesn't fit.

25:28.857 --> 25:30.958
Of course, it doesn't.

25:30.993 --> 25:34.095
But that's why I have to get
out of here. Can't you see?

25:34.129 --> 25:36.664
I don't understand.

25:36.699 --> 25:38.566
Cedric can't live in this world alone.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.268
He talked for months about
how he was going to get me

25:41.303 --> 25:44.071
out of here, how he was going to save me,

25:44.105 --> 25:46.873
how we could start over.

25:46.908 --> 25:48.942
He's my younger brother
and I love him but...

25:48.976 --> 25:50.744
But what?

25:50.778 --> 25:53.681
He is an incompetent.

25:53.715 --> 25:56.283
Nothing Cedric does ever works!

25:56.318 --> 25:58.284
He picked a harpy for a bride.

25:58.319 --> 26:00.687
He picked a lawyer who fleeced him dry.

26:00.722 --> 26:05.092
I have to be out in the
world to protect him.

26:07.095 --> 26:10.363
Miss Maxwell, if the
key your brother gave you

26:10.397 --> 26:12.365
didn't unlock the door,

26:12.399 --> 26:14.367
then how did you get out?

26:14.401 --> 26:16.769
I...

26:16.803 --> 26:19.739
pulled on the door, and it opened.

26:19.773 --> 26:22.908
I thought it was a gift from God.

26:22.943 --> 26:27.513
He was rewarding us,
even though Cedric failed.

26:27.548 --> 26:29.649
And why didn't you just leave?

26:29.683 --> 26:32.417
Meet your brother and
escape? He booked tickets.

26:34.487 --> 26:37.256
I wanted to make sure the witch was dead.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.424
I wanted to make sure

26:39.459 --> 26:42.594
she wasn't going to hurt anyone else!

26:52.238 --> 26:54.606
Since Cedric's plan failed,

26:54.641 --> 26:57.276
clearly someone other than
Rose opened those doors.

26:57.310 --> 26:59.344
- (door opening)
- Mr. Drainie?

26:59.379 --> 27:01.413
- (door closing)
- Well, I could see him

27:01.447 --> 27:03.414
forgetting to secure Rose's door.

27:03.448 --> 27:05.583
But opening all of them?
That was a deliberate act.

27:05.617 --> 27:08.253
I have to take another
look at all these files.

27:08.287 --> 27:11.455
One of them killed Nurse
Collins and is blaming Rose.

27:14.059 --> 27:17.361
- Can it wait until morning?
- I'd rather do it tonight.

27:17.396 --> 27:20.431
When shall I expect you then?

27:20.465 --> 27:24.201
William, when you've been
working on one of your cases,

27:24.235 --> 27:26.203
have you ever heard me ask that question?

27:26.237 --> 27:29.973
Right. I'll see you later then, Julia.

27:30.008 --> 27:32.209
Thank you, William.

27:32.243 --> 27:34.345
âª

27:38.817 --> 27:40.851
(indistinct conversations)

27:40.885 --> 27:43.020
(man): Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

27:45.190 --> 27:48.992
Already avoiding Mrs. Murdoch?

27:49.027 --> 27:52.229
- She's working late, sir.
- In the loony bin?

27:52.263 --> 27:54.230
Julia assures me

27:54.264 --> 27:56.966
- that she can take care of herself.
- Murdoch,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.737
if there's no chance of punishment,
why bother solving the crime?

28:00.771 --> 28:03.506
- To find out the truth, sir.
- The truth is

28:03.541 --> 28:05.675
one of those lunatics killed someone,

28:05.710 --> 28:07.877
and they will pay nothing
for having done it.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.714
Sir, those files you asked for.

28:11.748 --> 28:14.350
Oh, George, thank you.

28:14.384 --> 28:16.552
âª

28:31.100 --> 28:33.068
<i>(Mrs. Lynd): I can no
longer live in a world</i>

28:33.102 --> 28:36.004
that is so uncivil.

28:36.038 --> 28:38.974
Thieves and liars all around us.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.777
There are no more decent people.

28:41.811 --> 28:45.380
And how is one to live when
that is the way of the world?

28:45.414 --> 28:47.782
<i>I just couldn't stand</i>

28:47.816 --> 28:49.717
to see them suffer.

28:49.752 --> 28:53.454
<i>Maggie would scream and
cry from morning till night.</i>

28:53.489 --> 28:55.456
And Little Sarah suffered

28:55.491 --> 28:58.193
most extremely with rashes. I...

28:58.227 --> 29:00.528
I just wanted to let them sleep,

29:00.562 --> 29:02.530
to let them rest,

29:02.564 --> 29:04.499
<i>- let them find peace.
- Yes, two others</i>

29:04.533 --> 29:06.401
<i>who live with me.</i>

29:06.435 --> 29:08.403
<i>I know that now, but</i>

29:08.437 --> 29:10.605
I have them under control.

29:10.639 --> 29:13.307
Or at least I think I do.

29:13.341 --> 29:17.411
I just don't know who to believe sometimes.

29:34.694 --> 29:37.230
The world wants to deny me my happiness.

29:37.264 --> 29:40.365
But I wasn't gonna let that happen.

29:42.335 --> 29:45.337
People tell me I killed my family.

29:45.371 --> 29:48.474
I only did that to protect Cedric.

29:48.508 --> 29:49.308
(door slamming shut)

29:49.342 --> 29:51.677
(Julia sighs.)

29:51.711 --> 29:53.846
Oh. Ha.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.881
Here. Thank you, Samuel.

29:56.916 --> 30:00.052
- They're all secure tonight.
- Of course, they are.

30:02.055 --> 30:04.089
Sure wouldn't want that to happen again.

30:04.123 --> 30:07.960
Nor would I.

30:07.994 --> 30:11.295
And you want to be here alone?

30:11.330 --> 30:12.997
Like you said, they're all locked up.

30:14.934 --> 30:18.302
Samuel, before you were knocked
out, did you see anything?

30:18.337 --> 30:21.606
- Oh... I wish I had.
- Was Eva Pearce

30:21.640 --> 30:23.842
out in the ward when you saw Nurse Collins?

30:23.876 --> 30:25.844
I don't believe so.

30:25.878 --> 30:28.346
Of all of them, she's the least trouble.

30:30.315 --> 30:32.649
Thank you, Samuel.

30:46.731 --> 30:49.533
<i>It's not that simple to
be a woman in the world.</i>

30:49.567 --> 30:52.402
<i>I was engaged to be
married to a wonderful man.</i>

30:52.436 --> 30:55.572
I had been a poor girl
all my life, and suddenly

30:55.607 --> 30:58.274
a world of promise and wonder

30:58.309 --> 31:00.143
was laid out for me.

31:00.177 --> 31:02.345
And then he discarded me.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.914
I was desperate and betrayed.

31:04.948 --> 31:06.916
And something just snapped.

31:06.950 --> 31:10.353
(with echoing voice):
After that, I was blind,

31:10.388 --> 31:13.556
I couldn't recall anything that I did.

31:13.590 --> 31:17.226
But I was so full of rage.

31:24.635 --> 31:27.970
It's alright. Don't be scared.

31:32.409 --> 31:35.577
- Girly?
- (laughing): Hello!

31:35.611 --> 31:36.945
(Mrs. Lynd): Hello, Doctor.

31:36.979 --> 31:38.813
(Eva Pearce): Dr. Ogden.

31:41.284 --> 31:43.585
So nice of you to join us.

31:50.338 --> 31:52.272
(Julia knocking on the door)

31:52.307 --> 31:54.808
- Help!
- No one can hear us

31:54.842 --> 31:57.877
when one of us needs help.
I doubt they can hear you.

31:57.912 --> 32:00.080
My baby isn't feeling well.
Could you take a look at her?

32:00.115 --> 32:02.849
Miss Pearce, I need you to
open the door and let me out.

32:02.883 --> 32:05.352
You are no longer in the
position of telling me what to do,

32:05.386 --> 32:09.188
of telling any of us what to do.

32:09.223 --> 32:11.257
And what is it you're planning to do?

32:11.291 --> 32:13.693
Me? I'm going to leave this place.

32:13.728 --> 32:16.096
I asked very politely,

32:16.130 --> 32:19.132
even followed legal
channels, all to no avail.

32:19.166 --> 32:21.134
Then open the door and walk out.

32:21.168 --> 32:23.136
- I intend to.
- Get me out of this!

32:23.170 --> 32:25.004
Oh, she's getting anxious.

32:25.038 --> 32:27.440
Please Dr. Ogden, can you just
look at her. She's not well.

32:27.474 --> 32:29.542
Why are you doing this to me?

32:29.576 --> 32:31.544
Because you're vindictive and cruel.

32:31.578 --> 32:34.347
You know I don't belong in here,
but you are keeping me here,

32:34.381 --> 32:37.150
because you're afraid
I'll take your husband.

32:39.419 --> 32:41.586
(Julia knocking on the door) HELP!

33:15.353 --> 33:17.354
Where did you get those clothes?

33:17.389 --> 33:19.991
An admirer. I have plenty of them.

33:20.025 --> 33:23.161
None of us in here are very happy with you.

33:23.195 --> 33:25.163
How could you have allowed
us to be under the care

33:25.197 --> 33:27.165
of Nurse Collins?

33:27.199 --> 33:29.866
I had my practice in
another part of the building.

33:29.901 --> 33:32.069
I never even associated with Nurse Collins.

33:32.103 --> 33:35.906
- I had never even heard of her until...
- Rose killed her?

33:35.940 --> 33:39.176
So, if I'm to understand you correctly,

33:39.211 --> 33:42.112
you're pleading ignorance?
Is that your excuse?

33:42.146 --> 33:44.448
It is not an excuse, it's a fact.

33:46.017 --> 33:47.951
She was a horrid person!

33:47.985 --> 33:50.020
You allowed her in here with us!

33:50.054 --> 33:52.022
- I didn't even know...
- A wise woman

33:52.056 --> 33:54.725
knows what goes on under her own roof.

33:57.762 --> 34:00.396
It's time for Rose to do her work.

34:05.068 --> 34:06.969
Charlotte,

34:07.003 --> 34:09.205
is that you?

34:09.239 --> 34:12.442
Charlotte, you have to help me.
I know you're not a murderer.

34:12.476 --> 34:15.945
- You can't let them do this.
- I can't stop them.

34:17.947 --> 34:20.815
- (Rose): Please!
- There is a way out.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.985
- Show me.
- Won't tell them I told you?

34:23.018 --> 34:24.920
- Of course not.
- We have to hurry.

34:24.955 --> 34:26.668
There's a broken window in my bedroom.

34:26.668 --> 34:28.540
If you're careful, you can climb out.

34:36.065 --> 34:38.800
- (Charlotte-Maddie laughing)
- Fooled you!

34:38.833 --> 34:41.835
If there was a broken window in here,
wouldn't we have left through it?

34:41.871 --> 34:44.973
You must be scared. Because your
thinking isn't making any sense!

34:45.007 --> 34:48.943
Ah! Ah! (Julia panting)

34:50.846 --> 34:55.016
I thought you wanted to make us better.

34:55.050 --> 34:57.852
- I do.
- Can you believe that?

34:57.887 --> 34:59.687
She says she wants to make you better

34:59.721 --> 35:01.689
and the first thing she
does is try and run away.

35:01.723 --> 35:04.325
No one will make you better.

35:04.359 --> 35:07.762
I've heard what they
call you: the incurables.

35:07.797 --> 35:11.265
You will live in this room until you die.

35:11.300 --> 35:14.468
If you want out, follow me.

35:14.503 --> 35:16.370
Where did you get that?

35:16.405 --> 35:19.106
I have friends everywhere.

35:19.140 --> 35:21.542
I can be a very popular girl.

35:21.576 --> 35:24.378
Hmm, when we get out,
Eva and I are gonna find

35:24.413 --> 35:26.880
a couple of fine men,
live the life of Riley.

35:26.915 --> 35:29.649
Please, all of you. Please be quiet.

35:29.684 --> 35:32.986
I don't want to leave. I
just want you to be quiet.

35:33.021 --> 35:37.057
- My girls need their sleep.
- Sleepy time!

35:37.091 --> 35:39.559
Don't. Stop it! Stop it!

35:39.593 --> 35:42.028
- (Hannah screaming)
- They're not real.

35:42.062 --> 35:44.364
You're hurting her!

35:44.398 --> 35:49.135
(Hannah crying)

35:49.169 --> 35:52.472
Hannah, what happened to your baby?

35:52.506 --> 35:54.941
- Get away from me!
- Let me help you with your babies.

35:54.975 --> 35:58.677
- Don't touch her!
- Hannah, I can help you.

35:58.712 --> 36:02.315
- Don't cry.
- She doesn't deserve any comfort.

36:02.349 --> 36:04.416
There's no greater sin than
that of hurting a child.

36:04.451 --> 36:06.418
You reap what you sow.

36:06.453 --> 36:08.855
(Hannah crying)

36:08.889 --> 36:11.690
Help! Help! Mr. Drainie!

36:13.560 --> 36:15.894
Friends everywhere.

36:18.365 --> 36:21.867
- Did he give you that key?
- Men give me a lot of things.

36:21.901 --> 36:23.768
- Why?
- Men are simple.

36:23.802 --> 36:25.871
I should be going.

36:25.905 --> 36:29.207
I'm sorry for what Nurse
Collins did to you all.

36:29.242 --> 36:31.343
I will try to make it right!

36:31.377 --> 36:33.178
Nurse Collins never did anything to me.

36:33.212 --> 36:35.747
Or them either, I'll wager.

36:35.781 --> 36:38.282
Then who did?

36:41.219 --> 36:43.688
Mr. Drainie.

36:43.722 --> 36:45.757
Not Nurse Collins.

36:45.791 --> 36:48.292
It was Mr. Drainie that
visited them at night.

36:48.326 --> 36:49.960
Very good.

36:49.995 --> 36:51.796
And you knew and you said nothing?

36:51.830 --> 36:56.033
Oh, I said plenty. I told
Nurse Collins about Mr. Drainie.

36:56.067 --> 36:58.302
She was horrified.

36:58.336 --> 37:00.971
And then I told Mr.
Drainie what I had told her.

37:01.006 --> 37:03.473
And he killed her.

37:03.508 --> 37:06.243
I saw it with my own eyes.

37:06.278 --> 37:08.279
Why did he unlock all of the doors?

37:08.313 --> 37:10.046
I told him to.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.215
I wanted to help these poor women.

37:12.249 --> 37:15.285
At least that's more than
anything you ever did for them.

37:15.319 --> 37:17.287
But you showed up before
anyone could get away.

37:17.321 --> 37:20.590
- Why didn't you tell us what you saw?
- That wouldn't have got me out of here.

37:20.625 --> 37:23.493
Only Mr. Drainie could do that.

37:23.528 --> 37:26.162
So I told Mr. Drainie I'd
be needing the key again.

37:28.098 --> 37:31.401
And then I told him I
wanted to see you in here,

37:31.435 --> 37:34.670
just to see how you like it.

37:34.704 --> 37:37.640
You're not leaving.
You're not getting away!

37:37.674 --> 37:40.343
(grunting)

37:40.377 --> 37:43.679
Mine! Give it to me!

38:09.205 --> 38:12.674
(phone ringing)

38:14.910 --> 38:17.044
Answer!

38:21.650 --> 38:24.886
Ah...

38:31.527 --> 38:33.861
Goodbye, Dr. Ogden.

38:35.763 --> 38:37.731
Rose, put that down.

38:37.765 --> 38:39.633
- (door opening)
- If you hurt me,

38:39.667 --> 38:41.535
you will never see Cedric again.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.504
- (door closing)
- I'm going to kill you

38:43.538 --> 38:47.174
and leave this place. I'll see Cedric.

38:49.343 --> 38:51.845
(grunting)

38:51.880 --> 38:53.246
ARGH!

38:53.280 --> 38:54.347
Oh!

38:54.382 --> 38:56.817
Aaah!

38:56.851 --> 38:58.852
(suspenseful music)

39:11.598 --> 39:13.766
Eva Pearce!

39:15.702 --> 39:18.204
Ugh!

39:18.239 --> 39:20.306
Stop! Eva, stop!

39:22.910 --> 39:25.244
Ugh!

39:25.278 --> 39:28.047
(Eva panting)

39:29.650 --> 39:31.951
Off of me!

39:31.985 --> 39:34.420
So you are choosing me over Dr. Ogden?

39:34.454 --> 39:35.955
What are you talking about?

39:35.989 --> 39:38.290
Where do you think she
is, Detective Murdoch?

39:38.324 --> 39:40.592
And who do you think she's with?

39:40.626 --> 39:43.562
That is, if she's still with us.

39:46.232 --> 39:48.500
âª

39:52.439 --> 39:54.406
(Rose moaning)

39:54.441 --> 39:55.941
(Julia gasping)

39:58.077 --> 39:59.177
Ah!

40:05.851 --> 40:07.418
AAAH!

40:09.655 --> 40:11.889
(panting)

40:14.093 --> 40:16.127
Maddie, DON'T!

40:16.161 --> 40:19.663
- You... you hurt her.
- Don't do this!

40:19.698 --> 40:21.499
- You can't make me.
- If you hurt me,

40:21.533 --> 40:25.002
- Charlotte will be punished.
- I WILL!

40:25.036 --> 40:27.938
And Girly. All of them will be punished.

40:27.973 --> 40:30.340
If you hurt me,

40:30.374 --> 40:32.409
they'll all be locked away forever!

40:32.443 --> 40:35.012
And it will be your fault, Maddie!

40:35.046 --> 40:37.314
Charlotte, don't let her do this!

40:37.348 --> 40:42.552
Charlotte. I know what
Mr. Drainie did to you.

40:42.587 --> 40:45.122
He'll pay for it, I swear!

40:45.156 --> 40:47.790
I swear!

40:49.693 --> 40:54.164
Dr. Ogden?

40:54.198 --> 40:56.333
- What's wrong?
- (Clanking)

40:56.367 --> 40:58.701
Julia!

40:58.736 --> 41:00.703
- Julia.
- It was Drainie.

41:00.738 --> 41:02.705
Yes, yes, it's alright, I've got you.

41:02.740 --> 41:05.307
Well, you took your own
sweet time, didn't you?

41:21.451 --> 41:23.419
What did he say?

41:23.453 --> 41:25.421
He admits to taking

41:25.455 --> 41:27.623
liberties with some of the female patients.

41:27.657 --> 41:30.492
He would don a nurse's uniform and

41:30.527 --> 41:32.861
interfere with them.

41:32.896 --> 41:35.464
Most of them were drugged,
so they had no idea what was

41:35.498 --> 41:38.433
- happening to them.
- Except Eva.

41:38.467 --> 41:41.236
Mr. Drainie said Eva Pearce

41:41.270 --> 41:43.305
confronted him with the knowledge.

41:43.339 --> 41:46.641
And she also informed him that
she had told Nurse Collins.

41:46.675 --> 41:48.709
And he admits to killing her?

41:48.744 --> 41:50.711
Yes. He killed the nurse

41:50.746 --> 41:52.713
and then unlocked all of the doors.

41:52.748 --> 41:54.715
Good Lord!

41:54.750 --> 41:59.186
His real name is Jamison Wilkes.

41:59.220 --> 42:02.423
He was incarcerated
when he was 12 years old

42:02.458 --> 42:05.392
for the assault of his abusive father.

42:05.427 --> 42:08.830
He was in and out of institutions
most of his early years.

42:08.864 --> 42:12.399
It would appear his demons returned to him.

42:12.434 --> 42:14.568
I don't think the demons
ever leave, William.

42:14.602 --> 42:16.870
And the asylum

42:16.904 --> 42:19.006
never checked his
credentials? His past history?

42:19.040 --> 42:21.575
No, they did not.

42:21.609 --> 42:24.411
- Well, that is going to change.
- I should hope so.

42:24.446 --> 42:26.680
There's also not going to be

42:26.714 --> 42:29.850
a ward where patients
are kept in isolation.

42:29.884 --> 42:32.051
Can they be helped?

42:32.086 --> 42:35.489
At least they can be properly attended to.

42:35.523 --> 42:37.423
Where is Eva Pearce?

42:37.458 --> 42:39.926
Oh, I'm sure we'll find her.

42:39.961 --> 42:42.728
Or she'll find you.

42:46.033 --> 42:48.101
(people talking)

42:56.076 --> 42:58.077
Sir!

43:01.615 --> 43:05.016
I've been robbed, sir,
attacked most brutally.

43:05.050 --> 43:07.118
Could you help me?

43:07.152 --> 43:09.554
Please?

43:09.588 --> 43:11.789
Of course, madam.

43:11.824 --> 43:13.825
Of course.

43:17.407 --> 43:19.891
I'd like to introduce my
nephew Charlie Brackenreid.

43:19.902 --> 43:21.702

43:21.704 --> 43:23.837

- Hello, ladies.

43:23.839 --> 43:26.039
Just be sure to keep
this place to yourselves.

43:26.141 --> 43:27.441
We wouldn't want to be begin attracting

43:27.543 --> 43:28.742
the right sort of people.

43:28.744 --> 43:30.143
