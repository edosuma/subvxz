<i>Previously on "Absentia"...</i>

00:02.360 --> 00:05.400
Conrad Harlow. Killed that fed
Emily Byrne a while back.

00:05.445 --> 00:07.959
- You think the wrong man's in jail?
- This is a copycat.

00:08.360 --> 00:09.640
She's alive.

00:12.675 --> 00:15.184
- How long?
- You've been gone 6 years.

00:15.464 --> 00:18.282
I can't be around you, or her,

00:18.368 --> 00:21.235
without feeling like
I'm betraying someone.

00:21.241 --> 00:24.280
I've just got this blank space
where my memory should be...

00:24.286 --> 00:26.463
and this rage that I can't control.

00:27.811 --> 00:29.101
Emily! Emily.

00:29.107 --> 00:31.497
- Could Emily have killed Semerov?
- No.

00:31.677 --> 00:34.796
A fed. A crooked fed...
out of the Boston office.

00:34.847 --> 00:37.568
If you could see that look in your eyes.

00:37.826 --> 00:39.403
We both have it.

00:39.613 --> 00:43.004
<i>Stabbing victim, possible DOA,

00:54.520 --> 00:56.439
Tell me about the vision.

00:57.906 --> 00:59.560
The vision is getting worse.

01:00.280 --> 01:02.400
It's like it consumes me.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.001
And part of me just wants to forget it,

01:05.025 --> 01:07.751
and then the other part
just wants to remember.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.797
And I'm terrified of what
would happen if I ever do.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.432
It's just like I'm far away, just...

01:15.738 --> 01:17.355
looking at myself.

01:17.640 --> 01:21.640
Watching her, Emily... doing things.

01:28.217 --> 01:29.657
Does this make any sense?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.479
Complete sense.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.530
You have to be patient with yourself.

01:38.776 --> 01:41.617
What you're doing is not easy, Emily.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.399
You're trying. You
should be proud of it.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.276
He ordered an escort at... 11:46 p.m.

01:52.282 --> 01:54.290
She arrives just before 02:00...

01:54.737 --> 01:57.852
*** the body. Multiple stab wounds.

01:59.385 --> 02:00.706
Happened right here.

02:00.857 --> 02:02.176
A knife?

02:02.182 --> 02:03.951
From a *** in the kitchen.

02:04.553 --> 02:05.761
Missing.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.318
- Security cam?
- Someone cut them off at 11:58.

02:12.030 --> 02:15.040
Well, Tommy, you finally
got your big one.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.200
You might wanna clean up your act.

02:18.619 --> 02:20.139
You're not undercover anymore.

02:41.496 --> 02:43.545
Not your jurisdiction, Feeb.

02:46.779 --> 02:48.859
You're not the only Boston police
I know, Gibbs.

02:49.543 --> 02:51.535
So you're here to talk
about your ex-wife?

02:51.619 --> 02:52.859
She didn't do this.

02:53.637 --> 02:54.836
Do you got an alibi?

02:54.876 --> 02:56.407
I dropped her off at home,
her alibi is gonna be

02:56.431 --> 02:57.559
that she was sleeping.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.733
- Couldn't you just say "no"?
- I know this doesn't look good.

02:59.789 --> 03:01.160
That's an understatement.

03:01.384 --> 03:03.640
Weren't you looking for
Semerov at first too.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.010
You looked into any
witness yet, Kelly Price?

03:08.926 --> 03:10.366
You mean Regina Talbot.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.360
'Cause matter of fact, I did.
Looks like she skipped town.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.023
Someone is covering the tracks, Gibbs.

03:18.109 --> 03:19.875
Someone is trying to frame Emily.

03:19.984 --> 03:22.239
Well, you know as well as I do,
or you wouldn't be here.

03:23.043 --> 03:26.043
And it's just a matter of time
before this lands on Emily.

03:27.239 --> 03:29.680
Unless there's some
overwhelming evidence that...

03:29.752 --> 03:33.792
There is... there is one more thing
and it's not evidence exactly.

03:34.564 --> 03:35.777
What is it?

03:38.019 --> 03:39.139
What?

03:43.989 --> 03:48.000
There's a crooked agent,
in the Boston FBI field office.

03:48.959 --> 03:51.400
That's who turned
Regina Talbot into Kelly Price.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.879
And that person is afraid
that Emily is onto them.

03:56.312 --> 03:57.385
You're reaching.

03:57.410 --> 03:59.782
Yeah, m-maybe... maybe, but
I'm narrowing it down.

03:59.788 --> 04:01.835
If you could just buy me
some time on your end.

04:03.550 --> 04:05.097
Please. Please, um...

04:05.292 --> 04:07.449
I need you to keep BPD off Emily.

04:11.529 --> 04:13.649
Make sure your girl doesn't leave town.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.185
They found my DNA on Semerov's body

04:39.263 --> 04:40.677
and now Harlow is dead?

04:41.288 --> 04:43.869
- After I broke into his house?
- All right. Calm... calm down.

04:43.934 --> 04:45.612
Were you supposed to bring me in?

04:46.018 --> 04:48.565
- Is that why you're here?
- They have circumstantial case at best.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.331
You hate him, you confronted him.

04:50.479 --> 04:52.651
That doesn't prove beyond
reasonable doubt that you killed him.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.080
You're not going down for this.

04:56.698 --> 04:58.190
Not if...

04:58.604 --> 05:00.307
Not if we turn up another suspect.

05:00.408 --> 05:04.016
The agent who set me up for Semerov,
that's who's behind this.

05:05.117 --> 05:07.000
That's who killed Harlow.

05:07.904 --> 05:09.345
What am I gonna do?

05:09.852 --> 05:11.211
What are we gonna do?

05:12.123 --> 05:13.563
We stay focused.

05:13.731 --> 05:15.891
We find the crooked agent
behind Kelly Price.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.640
- You don't have an alibi, do you?
- No.

05:23.681 --> 05:25.176
I got those burners.

05:25.473 --> 05:27.473
We should start using these from now on.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.800
Wait, wait. I'm not going with you?

05:30.994 --> 05:32.781
Well, you're gonna take Flynn,

05:32.859 --> 05:35.522
go karting as planned...
You can pick him up from swim practice.

05:35.547 --> 05:37.415
Just me and him?
We were supposed to go together.

05:37.501 --> 05:39.501
It's okay. You'll be fine.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.138
Look, Nick...

05:43.708 --> 05:45.428
Why do you trust me?

05:47.860 --> 05:49.439
I know you.

05:50.089 --> 05:51.814
I'm gonna take care of this.

05:54.478 --> 05:55.664
All right?

06:10.043 --> 06:11.283
Hey.

06:12.182 --> 06:15.665
So, uh... It's just you and me... today.

06:15.690 --> 06:16.760
Your dad told you?

06:17.043 --> 06:19.091
- The coach told me.
- Okay.

06:19.599 --> 06:21.514
It should be fine, right?

06:21.640 --> 06:23.119
Where are we going?

06:24.200 --> 06:27.000
It's a surprise. Come on.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.360
Okay. You're ready to go?

06:45.066 --> 06:46.426
Okay, close your eyes.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.794
Here we go.

06:48.396 --> 06:51.121
Here you go. How's the... All right?

06:52.364 --> 06:53.509
Ready?

06:53.540 --> 06:55.239
Let me take a look at this.

06:56.098 --> 06:57.298
How does that feel?

06:57.379 --> 06:58.819
Feels all right? Okay.

07:35.555 --> 07:36.865
_

07:58.239 --> 08:00.085
- Hey.
- It was awesome!

08:00.155 --> 08:03.640
- Yeah, you were great. Good job.
- I wanna go again.

08:03.686 --> 08:05.800
- Yeah, okay.
- Do you wanna come with me?

08:07.297 --> 08:09.097
- Yes.
- I'll get your helmet.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.400
- Hey, Ericson...
- Yeah?

08:34.395 --> 08:36.066
Can you tell me how Crown

08:36.145 --> 08:38.879
could file a report from the office
at 10 p.m. when he left at 8?

08:39.285 --> 08:41.793
Yeah, sure, it's no big deal.
He asked me to cover for him.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.800
- Hey, you got a minute?
- What's up?

09:20.983 --> 09:23.615
I just wanna ask you about
the other night, you left early.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.600
What about it?

09:27.377 --> 09:29.580
You were clocked in
but you weren't here.

09:29.817 --> 09:31.041
Where were you?

09:31.276 --> 09:33.360
It's none of your business.

09:35.634 --> 09:38.520
Oh. You're seriously asking, aren't you?

09:41.720 --> 09:43.658
Fine, okay, uh...

09:43.814 --> 09:45.384
You really need to know?

09:47.522 --> 09:49.998
I may have left early
to meet a girl, okay?

09:50.037 --> 09:51.592
But if you saw what
she looked like, Nick...

09:53.560 --> 09:55.888
So that's it, you...
You were with a girl?

09:57.560 --> 09:59.079
What else would it be?

10:01.040 --> 10:02.559
I took her to Freddy's.

10:18.239 --> 10:20.207
- What was that...
- Is Emily okay?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.920
I'm just trying to get home.
I have nothing to say.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.720
Please, respect my privacy.

10:27.177 --> 10:28.763
Any information on the case?

10:28.788 --> 10:31.833
I've nothing to say. Please.
Please, no comment! Please!

10:37.400 --> 10:38.640
Emily!

11:31.484 --> 11:33.172
What are you thinking?

11:35.879 --> 11:37.075
Hello?

11:40.759 --> 11:43.722
What happened to you? When you were gone.

11:50.239 --> 11:51.520
Did they hurt you?

11:59.946 --> 12:01.507
I don't remember much.

12:05.363 --> 12:07.400
But I do remember thinking about you.

12:08.873 --> 12:10.473
That allowed me to go through it.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.720
The rest of it doesn't matter.

12:17.882 --> 12:19.203
Okay?

12:19.290 --> 12:20.520
Here you go.

12:21.192 --> 12:22.832
Yes, thank you.

12:26.252 --> 12:27.730
You ready to do this?

12:27.826 --> 12:29.306
Yeah? Let's go.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.879
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.479
Let's go!

12:38.463 --> 12:41.481
Whoo! Whoo-oo!

12:48.744 --> 12:50.064
Come on, Flynn!

12:50.156 --> 12:51.728
Whoo!

13:01.954 --> 13:04.360
Good job, honey. Good job.

13:12.915 --> 13:15.353
- That was cool.
- Yes? You're cool.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.280
- One more time round?
- All right, one more.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.273
- Three more?
- Yeah, nice try.

13:20.283 --> 13:21.959
I have to get you home. One.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.080
Two?

13:23.763 --> 13:25.434
All right. You ready?

13:25.550 --> 13:27.140
This time race for real.

13:27.555 --> 13:29.155
Get ready, buster.

13:34.512 --> 13:36.102
Yeah! Come on!

14:12.219 --> 14:13.459
No!

14:14.000 --> 14:16.239
Flynn! Flynn!

14:16.631 --> 14:18.558
Flynn! Oh, my God!

14:18.668 --> 14:21.387
Baby, my love! Baby...
No! Let go! Let go!

14:21.524 --> 14:24.434
Baby, just... call for help!
Do you hear me?

14:24.489 --> 14:26.801
Baby, come on. Can you hear me?

14:26.873 --> 14:28.127
What happened?

14:28.514 --> 14:31.915
I... He just... He came out of nowhere.

14:32.001 --> 14:35.063
- Does he have any previous head injuries?
- I-I don't know.

14:35.088 --> 14:36.797
- Are you a relative?
- Yeah, I'm his mom.

14:36.822 --> 14:38.560
- You have to stay here, okay?
- Yes.

14:38.585 --> 14:40.545
- You have to... You have to stay here.
- Okay.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.979
Hey, honey. Can I call you back in a sec?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.239
What? He... He's okay?

16:11.282 --> 16:13.072
Miss Byrne...

16:13.200 --> 16:15.931
Uh, we ran some tests just to be sure,

16:16.010 --> 16:18.560
but the results won't be ready
for another few minutes.

16:18.697 --> 16:21.864
He's stable. He's got
a little dizziness.

16:22.025 --> 16:23.384
However, he's...

16:23.585 --> 16:26.184
- Is Flynn okay?
- Excuse me, who are you?

16:26.360 --> 16:29.799
- I'm his mother.
- I thought you were his mother.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.600
She is. Is he okay?

16:34.406 --> 16:37.010
- Uh, he suffered a mild TBI, but...
- Is he okay?

16:38.140 --> 16:40.930
There are no signs the concussion
caused any lasting damage.

16:40.936 --> 16:44.094
However, there are some
symptoms to look for,

16:44.151 --> 16:46.032
just... just to be sure.

16:46.313 --> 16:48.830
- Can we see him first?
- Of course.

16:49.017 --> 16:52.063
I'll get one of the nurses to take
you in and I'll check in after.

16:54.487 --> 16:55.840
What happened?

16:59.034 --> 17:01.128
You can see him now, if you'd like.

17:15.328 --> 17:16.439
Hey.

17:16.878 --> 17:19.118
Oh, look at you.

17:19.597 --> 17:21.317
- How's your head?
- It's getting better.

17:21.342 --> 17:23.375
- Is it?
- That's great.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.055
I think we're gonna, um...

17:26.181 --> 17:29.649
take a break on racing
for a little while. How's that?

17:30.722 --> 17:31.922
Yeah.

17:35.442 --> 17:36.562
Hey.

17:52.675 --> 17:53.795
Hey.

17:54.004 --> 17:56.277
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

17:57.184 --> 17:58.957
How you feeling?

17:59.720 --> 18:02.780
- I drove real fast today.
- Yeah...

18:02.937 --> 18:04.733
Yeah, I heard.

18:06.365 --> 18:08.857
We need you to take it easy
for a little bit, okay?

18:09.479 --> 18:10.680
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.601
Thank you.

18:23.389 --> 18:24.546
For?

18:24.897 --> 18:26.705
For being so patient with her.

18:27.409 --> 18:28.930
It's not her fault.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.479
It's yours.

18:32.283 --> 18:34.169
You were supposed to be there.

18:37.088 --> 18:39.275
She should never have been
alone with him to begin with.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.642
It would've happened with me there too.
These things happen.

18:41.667 --> 18:45.025
They didn't have before.
You didn't ask me if it was okay.

18:45.087 --> 18:47.205
You didn't even let me know.
And when I got that call...

18:47.230 --> 18:48.330
Yeah. I'm sorry.

18:50.288 --> 18:51.824
I'm sorry. It's okay.

18:52.337 --> 18:54.319
He's okay. He... He's okay.

18:55.439 --> 18:57.560
- Next time I will...
- Next time?

19:00.879 --> 19:03.588
We will talk about this,
but right now I have to go.

19:03.650 --> 19:06.349
What? Now? You can't just take off.

19:06.359 --> 19:07.994
- I have to.
- What could possibly be so...

19:08.019 --> 19:09.809
Harlow was killed this morning.

19:11.970 --> 19:13.570
They like Emily for it.

19:14.439 --> 19:17.640
Wait, they think she murdered someone

19:18.600 --> 19:20.996
and you left her alone with Flynn?

19:21.239 --> 19:23.449
And now you're leaving
us alone to help her?

19:23.492 --> 19:25.377
- Of course she didn't do it.
- How do you know?

19:26.387 --> 19:28.877
- Were you with her?
- What? No, no, no, no.

19:28.952 --> 19:30.604
Help me, Nick.

19:31.071 --> 19:32.441
I'm trying to understand.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.400
I'm really trying.

19:37.107 --> 19:39.701
Right now, I have to go and do my job.

19:40.585 --> 19:42.336
And I need you to be okay with it.

19:43.739 --> 19:46.099
Hey. You know how much I love you.

20:01.871 --> 20:02.981
Hey.

20:03.194 --> 20:04.554
I'm sorry.

20:05.641 --> 20:07.119
He's gonna be okay.

20:09.292 --> 20:10.415
Listen.

20:11.754 --> 20:13.058
I have some leads.

20:13.320 --> 20:16.640
- I think it could be Crown.
- Are you sure?

20:16.683 --> 20:19.360
I don't know. There's too many variables.

20:20.369 --> 20:21.858
We'll have to check his alibi.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.320
So, we check alibis one by one?

20:26.212 --> 20:28.014
I don't have that kind of time.

20:28.138 --> 20:30.349
I know, but I don't know
what else we can do.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.356
We should go back to Harlow's place,

20:32.380 --> 20:33.739
we should see if there's anything there

20:33.786 --> 20:35.359
that links up to one of the agents.

20:35.369 --> 20:37.525
We don't have jurisdiction
over the Harlow crime scene.

20:37.550 --> 20:38.803
So what's our option?

20:38.828 --> 20:41.009
The only way this goes down,
is if I'm with you.

20:48.008 --> 20:51.498
You don't break rules, Nick.
It's not who you are.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.560
So don't start now.

20:55.123 --> 20:56.403
I'll text you.

21:00.075 --> 21:01.476
I'm coming with you.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.121
Any news on the Harlow case?

21:17.096 --> 21:20.350
Still crossing our t's.
This guy had a lot of enemies.

21:20.468 --> 21:21.702
Cross them faster.

21:21.771 --> 21:23.341
I'm getting pressure
from on high to make an arrest,

21:23.375 --> 21:25.037
and they love the idea
of it being a fed.

21:25.088 --> 21:27.082
If we arrest Byrne,
then we got to be certain.

21:27.521 --> 21:29.505
I'm not yet. Are you?

21:29.926 --> 21:31.889
No one in this department
thinks she's innocent.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.446
Doesn't make her guilty.

21:33.757 --> 21:36.101
Not all murderers look like one, Tommy.

21:45.701 --> 21:47.121
Watch out.

22:40.273 --> 22:41.682
There is nothing.

22:42.274 --> 22:43.314
Nothing.

22:48.713 --> 22:50.602
We have to move. We have to move.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.200
Come on.

23:03.081 --> 23:04.441
They're gone.

23:19.288 --> 23:21.447
Send me the pics, I'll run 'em through.

23:27.624 --> 23:28.738
Jack?

23:31.360 --> 23:32.680
You're home?

24:10.971 --> 24:12.035
Hey.

24:13.059 --> 24:14.179
Hey.

24:14.776 --> 24:16.059
What are you looking at?

24:17.201 --> 24:19.606
Nah, just chasing down a...

24:20.310 --> 24:22.614
soft lead and get nowhere.

24:22.620 --> 24:23.785
Uh.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.882
I just confirmed Cooper
couldn't have had Emily in the cabin.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.585
He was in a Mexican jail for a year.

24:29.609 --> 24:31.405
Got out after Emily was released.

24:33.261 --> 24:34.540
That's good.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.420
You got any more questions
you want to ask me, Nick?

24:41.730 --> 24:42.810
No.

24:44.046 --> 24:45.273
I'm cool.

24:46.006 --> 24:47.046
You?

25:28.212 --> 25:30.019
All right, so you're gonna
stand there judging me all night,

25:30.025 --> 25:31.485
or you gonna actually say something?

25:32.382 --> 25:33.659
You're drunk.

25:36.612 --> 25:38.092
Judgment it is.

25:38.439 --> 25:40.145
I'm worried, Jack.

25:40.473 --> 25:42.567
- There's difference.
- Is there?

25:44.202 --> 25:46.199
Is there really, Em?

25:46.688 --> 25:48.871
- I'm just trying to help.
- And how...

25:49.034 --> 25:51.690
exactly are you trying to help, Em?

25:51.715 --> 25:54.408
Because it seems to me like all
I'm doing is to cleaning up your messes!

25:54.433 --> 25:57.330
- Jack, what were you...
- No. No! It's my turn to talk now, okay?

25:57.463 --> 25:59.613
You have no idea what's been like, Em.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.001
No idea.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.640
Do you think you have
the monopoly on pain?

26:03.998 --> 26:07.456
I've been here, everyday,
in the real word,

26:07.519 --> 26:09.566
taking care of Dad,
trying to keep the lights on.

26:09.620 --> 26:11.824
Do you have any idea
the damage you've caused?

26:12.957 --> 26:14.199
No, of course you don't.

26:14.285 --> 26:15.808
Because you're the same
as you always were,

26:15.902 --> 26:17.769
the goddamn Emily show,

26:17.876 --> 26:19.637
from the day you were adopted.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.330
And you know what really gets me?

26:21.416 --> 26:23.544
Do you know what... really gets me?

26:24.739 --> 26:28.270
It's that just as life was starting
to become bearable again...

26:30.795 --> 26:32.275
you had to come back.

26:34.980 --> 26:37.540
You're such an asshole when
you drink, you know that?

26:37.636 --> 26:38.865
Yeah?

26:39.763 --> 26:41.082
Well, cheers.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.668
Fuck you!

26:49.291 --> 26:51.792
_

27:47.481 --> 27:48.952
Where are you?

27:49.044 --> 27:51.772
I just checked into a hotel.
You get a match?

27:52.084 --> 27:54.216
Then text me the address, I'm on my way.

27:54.525 --> 27:56.467
No, Nick, talk to me.

27:56.974 --> 27:58.513
Just text me the address.

28:15.116 --> 28:16.553
Hey, come in.

28:17.426 --> 28:19.859
- It's Adam.
- What?

28:20.374 --> 28:22.374
He's the one behind Regina Talbot.

28:22.695 --> 28:24.081
Oh, shit.

28:25.383 --> 28:28.093
I have to... I have to take this.

28:29.689 --> 28:31.322
- Yeah?
- Nick,

28:31.363 --> 28:33.155
you gotta bring Emily in right now.

28:33.263 --> 28:35.255
<i>We have new evidence. And it's bad.</i>

28:35.333 --> 28:37.529
I'm... I'm really
close to something, all right?

28:37.553 --> 28:39.303
If you could give me a little time.

28:39.559 --> 28:42.894
We have a video of her in the
vacinity of Harlow's house, again.

28:42.900 --> 28:44.454
Just minutes before the murder.

28:44.836 --> 28:47.524
What? That's impossible.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.099
- Are you sure?
- <i>Ask to her.</i>

28:51.610 --> 28:54.341
Ask her to look you in the eye
and tell you she wasn't there.

28:54.738 --> 28:56.662
Bring her in or I will.

28:57.793 --> 28:59.034
What?

29:00.654 --> 29:02.454
What happened?

29:04.382 --> 29:05.900
You want to tell me?

29:08.504 --> 29:09.975
Where were you that night?

29:12.684 --> 29:14.459
I said, where were you?

29:15.601 --> 29:17.361
You want... you want help?

29:18.293 --> 29:21.580
You were at Harlow's house... again?

29:24.054 --> 29:25.521
I can explain.

29:27.497 --> 29:29.586
You lied to me!

29:39.940 --> 29:41.940
You have any idea how bad is this?

29:41.989 --> 29:45.180
I didn't do it.
Please, Nick, I can explain.

29:45.263 --> 29:46.894
You think I'm an idiot?

29:47.630 --> 29:49.270
Do you think you can play me because

29:49.295 --> 29:50.724
I feel like shit that I never found you?

29:50.749 --> 29:53.247
No, I didn't kill him.
Just listen to me for a second.

29:53.272 --> 29:55.099
Where did you go?

29:56.407 --> 29:58.214
I didn't go to Harlow's.

29:58.986 --> 30:00.905
Emily, stop telling me what you want.

30:01.511 --> 30:03.116
Tell me where you were

30:03.454 --> 30:05.307
or I'm walking out that door.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.998
I wanted to see what it was like.

30:28.289 --> 30:29.649
Your life.

30:31.923 --> 30:33.680
What should have been my life.

30:36.265 --> 30:37.905
What are you talking about?

30:44.163 --> 30:45.452
Last night,

30:45.593 --> 30:48.124
when Riggs started barking
at something outside.

30:49.191 --> 30:50.706
It was me.

30:54.435 --> 30:55.720
I was there.

30:58.713 --> 31:00.152
Hiding.

31:07.088 --> 31:09.846
Just... watching you with her...

31:10.096 --> 31:11.853
with Flynn.

31:15.343 --> 31:18.029
You guys are so beautiful
together. All of you.

31:18.068 --> 31:19.512
I couldn't...

31:19.973 --> 31:21.896
I couldn't stop looking.

31:27.528 --> 31:29.911
It's like that movie
where the angel takes the guy

31:29.935 --> 31:32.231
and shows him what life
would be like without him.

31:34.380 --> 31:36.750
And everybody is so much worse off.

31:41.222 --> 31:43.423
Except in my case it's the opposite.

32:04.669 --> 32:06.769
I believe you, I do.

32:32.875 --> 32:34.355
Adam, um...

32:35.414 --> 32:37.418
Adam doesn't know...

32:38.199 --> 32:39.519
what we know.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.459
I'm gonna get him talking, um...

32:46.975 --> 32:48.813
I'm gonna see what shakes out of him.

32:51.628 --> 32:54.148
- You have to be careful, okay?
- I will.

32:58.785 --> 33:02.551
Does Jack or your father
know where you are?

33:03.965 --> 33:05.085
No.

33:06.114 --> 33:07.764
Don't leave this room.

33:12.925 --> 33:14.332
Listen to me, Gibbs.

33:14.357 --> 33:16.377
This is the mother of my child
that we're talking about.

33:16.402 --> 33:19.054
She's just saying her
goodbyes. That's it.

33:22.534 --> 33:25.014
You have my word. One hour.

33:26.119 --> 33:27.703
Look, I have to go.

33:33.035 --> 33:35.252
What are you doing here?
I was just on with BPD.

33:35.332 --> 33:37.051
They said they've arranged
for you to bring Emily here.

33:37.105 --> 33:39.494
Yeah, I... I just want to talk first.
Do you have a minute?

33:39.581 --> 33:42.490
Sure. Sure. You see the CCTV?

33:43.152 --> 33:44.980
No, they told me about it.

33:45.730 --> 33:46.878
Here, sit.

33:57.178 --> 33:58.457
You think she did it?

33:59.018 --> 34:00.858
It kills me but yes, I do.

34:02.173 --> 34:04.253
Emily shared something with me.

34:05.759 --> 34:08.121
A theory she had
back before she was taken.

34:08.737 --> 34:10.121
Oh, really? What's that?

34:10.498 --> 34:13.322
That's all kind of crazy to me,
to be honest.

34:13.748 --> 34:15.714
But it's stuck with me.

34:16.692 --> 34:18.628
It wouldn't stop bothering me, you know.

34:18.723 --> 34:19.960
I think I know where this is going.

34:19.984 --> 34:21.811
Is this Emily's crooked agent theory?

34:21.898 --> 34:23.866
Yes, it is, actually.

34:24.103 --> 34:27.895
I knew she suspected someone
from way back on the Semerov case.

34:28.221 --> 34:30.181
Hell, I did too for a moment.

34:30.810 --> 34:33.172
But I checked it out,
I checked everybody out.

34:33.482 --> 34:35.241
There was no crooked agent.

34:36.697 --> 34:38.578
Were you ever at Harlow's place?

34:41.965 --> 34:46.465
Nick, you're a good agent...
and a friend.

34:47.818 --> 34:50.821
And I understand why you have
a blindspot for your ex-wife.

34:50.868 --> 34:52.418
Please answer the question, Adam.

34:54.101 --> 34:57.143
Yes, I was there yesterday.

34:59.178 --> 35:02.881
Had a question for Harlow
whether his accomplice was Emily.

35:03.219 --> 35:04.419
It's not a secret.

35:11.207 --> 35:13.127
What is it you think, Nick?

35:14.505 --> 35:17.489
That I killed Harlow to frame Emily?

35:18.818 --> 35:20.536
Or could it be that...

35:20.707 --> 35:23.004
all the evidence against her
is just that...

35:23.977 --> 35:25.261
Evidence.

35:26.377 --> 35:28.298
Do you know Kelly Price?

35:28.737 --> 35:30.698
She also went by Regina Talbot.

35:32.617 --> 35:34.937
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this...

35:36.841 --> 35:38.695
but I care to much about you

35:38.728 --> 35:41.216
to see you risk your career
or whatever else

35:41.247 --> 35:43.246
on Emily's desperate theories.

35:43.698 --> 35:47.714
And I can only imagine...
the kind of stress you've been under.

35:48.457 --> 35:49.845
And that is why

35:49.917 --> 35:53.696
I'm gonna let this whole
misguided conversation slide.

35:58.018 --> 35:59.778
Don't you have somewhere to be?

36:05.698 --> 36:06.937
You're right.

36:07.778 --> 36:09.698
I haven't been thinking.

36:11.309 --> 36:13.188
It must be the stress.

36:20.058 --> 36:22.582
You're lucky I'm understanding, Nick.

36:24.841 --> 36:26.881
This is a second chance I'm giving you.

36:29.278 --> 36:31.714
Life doesn't give a second
chance too often.

40:01.829 --> 40:03.392
What?
