01:45.939 --> 01:48.681
Kat: Hi, this is Kat. Leave a
message and I'll call you back.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.735
Nick: Hi, Kat.
This is Nick Mercer.

01:53.739 --> 01:57.823
Sorry I didn't get back to you last
night but I got your messages.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.445
All seven of them.

02:00.495 --> 02:04.738
I know you're nervous, Kat, but
this is what I get paid for.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.451
I'm running late so I sent a
messenger to pick up my ticket.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.045
Kat, stop worrying.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.756
Your ex-fiancÃ© will
wish he never left you

02:14.760 --> 02:17.342
and your family will
think we're in love.

02:17.346 --> 02:20.804
Trust me. I'll see you at the airport.
Can't wait to meet you.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.851
So sorry. I wasn't quite ready.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.992
It's a plane ticket.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.289
For a date. My date.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.544
For my sister's
wedding, in London.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.542
You need to let go.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.052
You're gonna have to help me.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.607
Oh yeah

03:18.281 --> 03:21.569
the daylight's fading slowly

03:21.576 --> 03:25.819
but time with you
is standing still

03:25.831 --> 03:29.540
I'm waiting for you only

03:29.543 --> 03:33.582
the slightest touch
and I feel weak

03:33.588 --> 03:35.795
I cannot lie

03:35.799 --> 03:39.838
from you I cannot hide

03:39.845 --> 03:43.463
I'm losing the will to try

03:43.473 --> 03:47.182
can't hide it, can't fight
it can't hide, can't fight

03:47.185 --> 03:50.643
so go on, go on

03:50.647 --> 03:53.730
come on, leave me breathless

03:53.734 --> 03:56.020
tempt me, tease me

03:56.027 --> 04:00.691
until I can't deny
this loving feeling

04:00.699 --> 04:04.783
feeling
make me long for your kiss

04:04.786 --> 04:07.573
go on, go on go on, go on

04:07.581 --> 04:10.539
yeah, come on

04:13.879 --> 04:15.540
yeah

04:18.759 --> 04:22.091
and if there's no tomorrow

04:22.095 --> 04:26.134
and all we have is here and now

04:26.141 --> 04:30.100
I'm happy just to have you

04:30.103 --> 04:34.096
you're all the love
I need somehow

04:34.107 --> 04:36.393
it's like a dream

04:36.401 --> 04:38.642
although I'm not asleep

04:40.113 --> 04:43.947
I never want to wake up

04:43.950 --> 04:47.568
don't lose it, don't leave it
don't lose it, don't leave it

04:47.579 --> 04:50.992
so go on, go on

04:50.999 --> 04:54.412
come on, leave me breathless

04:54.419 --> 04:57.126
tempt me, tease me

04:57.130 --> 04:59.837
until I can't deny this

04:59.841 --> 05:04.050
loving feeling loving feeling

05:04.054 --> 05:05.794
make me long for your kiss

05:05.806 --> 05:08.673
go on, go on

05:08.683 --> 05:11.390
come on, leave me breathless

05:11.394 --> 05:13.931
tempt me, tease me

05:13.939 --> 05:19.525
until I can't deny
this loving feeling

05:19.528 --> 05:22.861
make me long for your kiss

05:22.864 --> 05:25.571
go on, go on

05:25.575 --> 05:28.487
come on, leave me breathless

05:28.495 --> 05:30.531
go on, go on

05:30.539 --> 05:33.155
woman on P.A.: 356
to London Heathrow,

05:33.166 --> 05:36.624
all remaining passengers
please make your way...

05:36.628 --> 05:39.370
Kat: Harry, I'm not working, I'm
going to my sister's wedding.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.497
Customer service will have
to survive without me.

05:41.508 --> 05:46.002
But Kat, we've had three delays
and two reps call in sick.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.504
And a 2505 on
the a20 cpt to lgw.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.552
And there's this guy on line two

05:51.560 --> 05:55.678
who got stuck with in-laws because
we couldn't get him out of Heathrow.

05:55.689 --> 05:59.978
I'd love to help you, sincerely, but I
haven't seen my family in two years

05:59.985 --> 06:02.647
and my flight leaves
in 15 minutes.

06:03.113 --> 06:07.197
Come on, Kat. Please,
I'm begging you.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.616
Bump the 14:14
to the upper on 16:10.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.659
What about line two?

06:17.419 --> 06:18.909
Check my bags.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.788
I understand, you want your family
to see you the way you see yourself,

06:22.799 --> 06:25.962
or would, if you didn't
feel so victimized by them.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.709
Hello!

06:28.471 --> 06:33.465
We regret that you were inconvenienced.
Unfortunately, we are not liable.

06:35.437 --> 06:39.271
But just this once I'll refund your ticket
and credit you 10,000 frequent flyer miles.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.356
Thank you for calling
virgin Atlantic.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.323
Your first trip?

06:57.959 --> 07:00.826
My sister's getting married
and the best man is my ex.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.249
If I chicken out, I wanna
know where the exits are.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.506
I'm not a knuckler,
I fly all the time.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.974
The reason I can't feel my legs

07:16.978 --> 07:19.936
is that any second my date
is gonna sit down in 3b

07:19.940 --> 07:22.272
and I need him to
look really good today.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.482
Hello, 3b.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.907
Thank you.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.158
Hey.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.582
Kat.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.546
Let's sit.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.305
I'm glad you found it okay.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.357
The airport...
The plane, I mean.

08:06.987 --> 08:11.151
I'm sorry we couldn't leave sooner. I know
you wanted to get settled before the party.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.732
Work must be crazy.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.204
Oh, I should warn you.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.752
You know those families where
everyone's out of their mind

08:29.759 --> 08:31.966
but they're your family
so you love them?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.756
Mine's not like that.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.401
I love my dad.

08:50.405 --> 08:54.239
But since he's my stepdad,
he's technically not family.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.857
He's more like a hostage.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.043
Woman on P.A.:
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:11.051 --> 09:14.714
we will shortly be arriving
at London Heathrow.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.087
On arrival, please remain seated

09:17.098 --> 09:20.636
until the seat belt sign
has been switched off.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.259
Local time is 4:22 P.M.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.102
And the temperature
is a warm 21...

09:25.106 --> 09:26.937
Good morning.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.024
That's 72 degrees fahrenheit.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.815
We would like to thank you
for flying with us today

09:32.822 --> 09:35.564
and look forward to
seeing you again soon.

09:39.913 --> 09:40.993
On.

09:43.458 --> 09:47.042
Nick, please tell me you're
not wearing that tonight.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.578
I am.

09:49.881 --> 09:55.251
It's no big deal really, it just looks like
a tailor made your tie out of my dress.

09:55.512 --> 10:01.473
Don't get me wrong, matching's fine. It's
matchy-matchy you wanna look out for.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.767
We look like we're trying too hard.
Exactly.

10:04.771 --> 10:08.480
I want us to look like we fit but not
like we're trying to look like we fit.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.019
Let me teach you a trick.

10:11.027 --> 10:15.316
If you look people in the eye, they'll
never notice what you're wearing.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.440
Kat: There's no way I'm showing
up in his and her outfits

10:18.451 --> 10:21.784
so if you're gonna wear that
tie, I have to change my dress.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.700
Driver, will you please
pull over somewhere?

10:31.089 --> 10:34.377
Kat: I'm sorry. I promise
this is the last one.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.133
You must think...
Who knows what you think?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.594
Nick: I know how important
this is for you.

10:40.181 --> 10:44.015
But remember, you're a beautiful woman
and you've got everything going for you.

10:44.018 --> 10:45.724
Kat: Don't patronize me.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.596
I feel like crap but I
wanna look hot doing it.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.026
Mission accomplished.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.519
Really?

10:57.365 --> 10:59.697
Don't get too attached.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.449
I prefer the red one.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.831
I'll let her know.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.166
Hmm...

11:18.178 --> 11:21.136
"Hmm, nice dress," or "hmm...

11:21.139 --> 11:24.472
"Gorgeous.
I was insane to let you go"?

11:25.101 --> 11:27.558
Well, I'd shag you.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.427
If that's all right with you?

11:40.241 --> 11:42.106
I don't know if I can do this.

11:42.118 --> 11:46.236
Well, you can never be sure of anything
but we still have to go inside.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.751
Aunt beal

11:57.759 --> 11:59.295
dear girl.

11:59.302 --> 12:02.339
This should have been
you getting married.

12:02.347 --> 12:06.056
You know, you didn't have
to return the gravy boat.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.801
And to think Jeffrey
is the best man.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.597
Have you met Nick?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.596
How do you do? Oh.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.766
Charming.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.767
And what do you do?

12:18.821 --> 12:20.106
Excuse us.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.860
What a nightmare.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.078
Okay, we need a story.

12:33.086 --> 12:37.546
You're a therapist, we just started
dating and you're crazy about me.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.500
Count it. 6,000 even.

12:42.512 --> 12:46.221
Oh, I trust you. No. Count it.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.764
All right.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.859
I'll cover expenses but if you want
to be intimate, we talk money first.

13:03.866 --> 13:07.825
That won't be an issue. I find the idea
of sex for money morally repugnant.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.913
I'm sorry. No offense.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.992
Do me a favor, quit apologizing.

13:16.004 --> 13:19.121
If you look at this
as a business transaction,

13:19.132 --> 13:21.874
maybe you won't feel compelled
to keep saying sorry.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.420
I'm sorry.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.134
It's also really annoying.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.351
Sorry.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.570
Sorry. Pussy Kat!
What happened to you?

13:44.574 --> 13:49.068
Pull over for a quickie? Mom, this
is so not the time to be yourself.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.778
And who might this be?

13:51.789 --> 13:54.531
Hi. I'm the new guy.
It's great to meet you.

13:54.542 --> 13:58.080
Lovely. This is a
marathon, not a sprint.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.169
We've got welcome
cocktails today

14:00.173 --> 14:03.540
then tomorrow's young people in
the park and stags and hens.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.042
Friday's the picnic,
then the rehearsal dinner

14:06.054 --> 14:10.047
and since you have left
no margin for jetlag,

14:10.058 --> 14:12.140
I need you to hydrate.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.064
Dad. My darling.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.901
Meet Nick. Professor Ellis.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.065
How do you do?

14:25.907 --> 14:26.942
Kat?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.609
Kat! Oooh! I'm getting married!
Oh, kitty! Hey!

14:30.620 --> 14:32.201
Oh, I missed you so much.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.163
Gosh, who's the
hunky, huh? Nice.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.748
There you are! Get over here!

14:39.337 --> 14:42.875
At times like these, I find
a good, stiff drink helps.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.874
Can I get you a refill, sir?
Very kind of you.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.800
Where did you find him?

14:48.805 --> 14:50.545
Thank you.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.555
Yellow pages.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.559
Mrs. Ellis: Hello!

15:00.274 --> 15:02.811
Sweet Jesus. Who
gave that woman an amp?

15:02.819 --> 15:05.526
Bunny: Hello. Hello?

15:05.530 --> 15:08.613
Oh. Wonderful.
It's finally working.

15:08.616 --> 15:13.076
Does everybody have a drink? Because
I am going to say a few words.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.786
Welcome, friends and family...

15:17.250 --> 15:18.615
Bunny: I'm...

15:18.835 --> 15:21.326
Victor and I are so happy

15:21.337 --> 15:24.295
that you're here
to celebrate with us

15:24.298 --> 15:28.758
as we welcome Edward and the
Fletcher-wootens into our family.

15:28.761 --> 15:33.380
We always thought that we
would marry off Kat first.

15:33.391 --> 15:37.600
We had good reason to hope because she
was so popular with the boys at school

15:37.603 --> 15:39.844
and we came pretty close once,

15:39.856 --> 15:43.314
but, as you all know,
that crashed and burned.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.607
Luckily, we were able
to get the deposit back,

15:47.613 --> 15:48.978
so here we are again...

15:55.163 --> 15:57.154
Jeffrey: To the bride and groom.

15:58.291 --> 16:03.411
Oh. Yes. Yes. Well, back to
the bride and groom to be.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.496
Um...

16:06.507 --> 16:12.503
Edward, we are so glad that you fell
in love with the girl next door.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.555
Our Amy.
Congratulations, babies.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.889
All: Congratulations.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.529
Jeffrey.

16:33.201 --> 16:36.113
Hello. Kat-mandu.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.753
Wow, you look gorgeous.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.756
Gorgeous.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.130
Tj: Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

16:57.141 --> 17:01.100
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my
god, oh, my god! Top Kat! Ooooh!

17:01.103 --> 17:03.219
Where the bloody
hell have you been?

17:03.231 --> 17:05.563
I have gynecologists
that call more often.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.976
You have more than one?

17:06.983 --> 17:10.226
I play them off
against each other.

17:10.238 --> 17:14.446
Hello, arsehole. Since you
dumped my cousin brutally,

17:14.450 --> 17:16.862
you won't mind if I
steal her away, will you?

17:16.868 --> 17:18.905
Thanks.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.744
You didn't have to do that.

17:25.752 --> 17:29.917
I wasn't saving you from him, I
was saving you from yourself.

17:29.924 --> 17:33.462
You, my love,
are too bloody nice.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.338
I've never seen so many
beautiful women in one room.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.759
Did he bring a date?

17:39.767 --> 17:42.759
Darling, why waste time
on that horse's arse

17:42.770 --> 17:46.388
when Mr. tie me up, tie me down
is waiting for you over there?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.765
What does he do?
He's a therapist.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.475
The perils of paranoia. Yes.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.396
Oh, god. I think I've just come.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.572
Thank you.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.575
Can I have that?

18:12.967 --> 18:14.628
Hmm.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.798
Thank you.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.720
You know what I love
about all this, Kat?

18:23.728 --> 18:27.186
There's finally a reason for the
world to revolve around you?

18:27.189 --> 18:28.975
Exactly.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.652
There you are.
How's the future missus?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.862
I'm perfect, I'm all Ginny.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.198
Amy: Thanks, snufflepop.

18:43.164 --> 18:46.201
Mmm! Mmm mmm mmm!

18:47.001 --> 18:48.707
Wow!

18:48.711 --> 18:51.498
Am I not the luckiest
bastard on earth?

18:51.505 --> 18:55.248
Amy: Aw! Well,
I'll dance to that.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.838
Oh! Oh, Jesus!

19:00.681 --> 19:03.673
That's what he gets for
not taking dance lessons

19:03.684 --> 19:06.175
until two days
before the wedding.

19:06.187 --> 19:09.099
Who's ever heard of
dance lessons for a wedding?

19:09.106 --> 19:11.518
Just about everyone.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.024
You are taking the piss?

19:14.195 --> 19:15.355
We'll go with you.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.355
I don't even know you, hunky
dunky, and I love you already.

19:18.908 --> 19:23.072
Ed: Dance lessons? Hmm. Right.

19:32.046 --> 19:35.038
Hey. Oh. Hello.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.345
Weddings are a celebration
of love and commitment...

19:43.724 --> 19:45.430
In utopia.

19:45.434 --> 19:49.518
In the real world they're an excuse to drink
excessively and say things you shouldn't.

19:49.522 --> 19:53.731
A philosopher, huh?
Well, shrink.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.895
Crikey! What?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.859
No, nothing. No, tell me.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.946
Well, you yanks
and your therapy,

20:00.950 --> 20:04.192
it's a load of
touchy-feely mumbo jumbo.

20:05.162 --> 20:08.620
Spilling your guts to a total
stranger, it's not natural.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.077
Oh, god.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.079
It's just...

20:17.091 --> 20:22.506
There's this girl that I care for... well,
I suppose you could say I love her.

20:23.305 --> 20:26.547
The bugger is, she's here
with some other guy.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.220
There you are.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.095
Hey, Kat. Hey, Kat.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.768
Oh, hey, yourself.
I see you met my ex.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.944
I was just telling him how we met.
Mmm.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.774
The Knicks game. Oh, yes.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.650
Yeah... oh.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.277
You hate sport.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.780
I hate cricket. Right, yes.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.288
Well, I should go and... go.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.790
He looks miserable.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.300
What were you talking about?

21:03.304 --> 21:07.297
He seems a little drunk but I
think he's still crazy about you.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.682
Do I know you from somewhere?
No.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.262
What did he say? You don't...

21:15.649 --> 21:17.640
You don't think
he wants me back?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.477
Love started making sense

21:21.489 --> 21:25.698
I always make mistakes
at my expense

21:25.701 --> 21:29.614
love has placed a seed

21:29.622 --> 21:33.661
and you're the sun
that shines down upon me

21:33.667 --> 21:37.580
yeah, when we are together

21:37.588 --> 21:39.374
and when we are apart

21:39.381 --> 21:41.622
are you okay?

21:43.761 --> 21:46.343
Here we are. Thank god!

21:46.347 --> 21:49.305
Oh! Thanks, mom.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.050
There you are, darling.
Thanks, dad.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.260
God!

21:57.858 --> 21:59.268
Thanks again for having me.

21:59.276 --> 22:02.643
Don't be silly. It's
wonderful to meet you.

22:02.655 --> 22:06.273
Although technically,
I never knew you existed.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.616
Come on, bunny.
I love surprises.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.570
Where's Nick sleeping?

22:13.082 --> 22:17.121
My mother has this rule about sharing
when there's no ring involved...

22:17.127 --> 22:19.539
Don't be silly. What?

22:20.589 --> 22:24.707
I am not as small-town as
my daughter seems to think.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.899
Sorry about this.

22:42.903 --> 22:46.111
I went through a painfully
earnest floral phase.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.113
Air supply?

22:58.544 --> 23:02.583
Oh. My parents had a German
exchange student a few years back.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.582
He must have left it here.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.176
Everyone knows
their greatest hits.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.471
Some of their lesser-known ballads
are surprisingly poignant.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.448
Is that an old habit
from ballet class

23:31.452 --> 23:34.239
or from a lifetime of
walking on eggshells?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.414
I never took ballet.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.294
How'd you know that was me?

23:57.353 --> 23:59.389
I have a friend at the magazine.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.638
So much for anonymity.

24:02.650 --> 24:05.767
Go ahead, take a look.
It's part of the package.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.653
I'm sorry, I'm just
a little nervous.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.574
I never thought anything
like this could happen to me.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.572
This happened to you?

24:20.584 --> 24:24.247
It happened in the sense that I picked
up the phone, tracked you down,

24:24.254 --> 24:27.667
flew you over here
and gave you $6,000.

24:36.642 --> 24:40.351
Will you grab my shampoo, please?
Shampoo! Got it.

24:44.817 --> 24:49.561
Nick: I'm all out of
love, I'm so lost without you

24:49.571 --> 24:53.940
I know you were right
believing for so long

24:53.951 --> 24:59.241
I'm all out of love
what am I without you?

24:59.248 --> 25:05.619
I can't be too late to say
that I was so wrong?

25:09.508 --> 25:13.626
The part where you were a sexual
surrogate and then started to...

25:14.763 --> 25:16.754
Branch out, is...

25:17.683 --> 25:20.470
Is that really how it happened?

25:20.477 --> 25:24.686
The real story, my mother
was a hippie, and a stripper.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.898
She was insanely
inappropriate with me,

25:27.901 --> 25:31.314
she washed her lingerie in my bath
water while I was still in it.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.027
On.

25:33.032 --> 25:37.071
So as an adult, I needed to find
ways to experience intimacy and sex

25:37.077 --> 25:40.035
but with rules that
couldn't be violated. Wow.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.368
I'm just screwing with you.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.793
You shit.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.543
Okay, this part.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.087
You say, and I quote,

25:54.094 --> 25:57.257
"every woman has the
exact love life she wants."

25:57.264 --> 25:59.971
That seems a broad
generalization... oh!

26:10.611 --> 26:12.272
On.

26:13.238 --> 26:18.073
Do you honestly believe that I
want to be single and miserable?

26:18.077 --> 26:22.286
Do you think that I want to be hung up
on some guy who led me on for years

26:22.289 --> 26:25.076
and out of the blue
shattered my heart?

26:25.084 --> 26:29.293
First of all, there's no such
thing as out of the blue.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.787
And second of all, yeah.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.381
What? When you're
ready to let go,

26:34.384 --> 26:37.217
to be un-single
and un-miserable,

26:37.221 --> 26:38.757
you will.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.425
Till then...

26:43.268 --> 26:46.226
So when you were talking
to Jeffrey before,

26:46.230 --> 26:48.221
how did he sound?

26:48.232 --> 26:51.565
Like a harmless,
self-absorbed toolbox.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.650
Seriously.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.653
He sounded tormented.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.409
Tormented? How?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.407
Like he's...

27:04.873 --> 27:07.740
Jealous that I'm here
with someone else, or like...

27:09.294 --> 27:12.502
He regrets throwing
away our life together?

27:22.391 --> 27:24.382
It's just that...

27:25.227 --> 27:29.391
This hasn't really turned out the
way that I thought it would.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.769
Hey, Nick.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.111
Oh, oh, oh!

27:53.338 --> 27:55.329
He seems more mature.

27:55.799 --> 27:58.131
Run, you fat tart! Come on.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.720
Shoo be do be do be

28:03.724 --> 28:06.386

come on, throw it. Throw it!

28:09.438 --> 28:13.397
You'll look at me
and even though I know...

28:13.400 --> 28:15.561
Well played, darling. Ed!

28:15.569 --> 28:17.059
What?

28:17.070 --> 28:18.310
One fine day...

28:18.322 --> 28:20.608
Are you ready, tj? Bugger off.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.572
You're gonna want
me for your girl

28:22.576 --> 28:25.113
shoo be do be do be

28:25.120 --> 28:27.327
oh yeah

28:27.331 --> 28:29.367
Nick: All right, batter, batter.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.285
The arms I long for
will open wide

28:31.293 --> 28:33.454
shoo be do be do be

28:44.223 --> 28:45.804
shoo be do be do be

28:45.807 --> 28:47.547
move back. Yeah.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.729
Though I know
you're the kind of boy...

28:53.732 --> 28:55.063
Nick: Come on, Kat.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.398
Who only wants to run around

28:56.401 --> 28:58.483
batter up.

28:59.613 --> 29:00.773
Nick: You're up, Kat.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.237
I'll be waiting...

29:02.241 --> 29:03.731
Amy: Go, Kat.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.781
Someday, darling,
you'll come to me

29:07.788 --> 29:11.326
when you want
to settle down, oh!

29:11.333 --> 29:13.369
Be nice to me, Jeffrey.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.914
One fine day
we'll meet once more

29:15.921 --> 29:18.162
shoo be do be do be

29:18.173 --> 29:20.084
out! Yes!

29:22.135 --> 29:23.295
One fine day...

29:23.887 --> 29:25.969
Lose the game.

29:25.973 --> 29:30.307
You're gonna want
me for your girl

29:35.857 --> 29:37.518
Nol

29:38.277 --> 29:41.110
come on! Edward.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.068
Come on!

29:46.076 --> 29:48.738
Come on, you sexy
little monkey. Come on!

29:51.748 --> 29:54.911
You're supposed to be helping.
Oh, trust me. I am.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.910
One fine day, oh yeah
one fine day

29:57.921 --> 30:00.503
you're gonna want me for
your girl one fine day

30:00.507 --> 30:03.999
one fine day oh yeah

30:04.011 --> 30:05.672
one fine day

30:24.031 --> 30:27.615
Nick: What's with the socks? Kat:
It's a golf-themed bachelorette.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.573
Have you ever done
a wedding before?

30:29.578 --> 30:31.409
No, but I have done funerals.

30:31.413 --> 30:34.371
An escort at a funeral?
Someone's dead.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.581
Yeah, imagine facing that alone.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.917
Ah. Catch.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.088
Make sure he stays on the
right side of the road.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.548
Which is, of course, the left.
That's right.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.884
Kat: So, are you ever
attracted to your clients?

30:51.475 --> 30:56.640
I know you're curious about my business
but I really can't discuss other clients.

30:56.646 --> 31:00.059
Come on! How many of them
want to sleep with you?

31:01.068 --> 31:05.232
You know, I swear it's
not about the sex.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.146
It's about understanding
what people need.

31:08.408 --> 31:12.321
Please! You're like
the Yoda of escorts.

31:12.329 --> 31:15.867
Getting you on the phone was
harder than getting into college.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.082
No, I don't play games.
No gimmicks. Mmm-hmm.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.077
It's much more...

31:22.464 --> 31:24.125
Subtle?

31:26.885 --> 31:29.467
It's not about me.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.462
It's about you.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.177
Show me.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.141
Come on.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.858
Hmm... what's holding me back?

31:45.112 --> 31:48.400
I think it's the words
"morally repugnant".

31:48.990 --> 31:50.651
Show me.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.955
Close your eyes.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.208
Close your eyes.

32:05.799 --> 32:09.041
Close your eyes.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.596
You're safe, you can relax.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.889
I'm not gonna kiss you.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.811
He's gonna be so
sorry he lost you.

32:31.533 --> 32:34.525
So, stop worrying.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.320
Forget the past.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.952
Forget the pain.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.701
And remember...

32:46.047 --> 32:48.880
What an incredible
woman you are.

32:53.013 --> 32:55.299
If you do that,

32:55.307 --> 32:57.218
he'll realize what he lost.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.147
Holy crap!

33:06.485 --> 33:08.021
You're worth every penny.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.275
You should get going. Mmm-hmm.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.035
Okay, Yoda.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.799
To Amy!

33:39.267 --> 33:43.852
Girl, to be with you
is my favorite thing

33:47.442 --> 33:49.524
I thought you might need this.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.444
Silly me. Where was my head?

33:53.198 --> 33:55.564
Bye. Listen, why don't you stay

33:55.575 --> 33:58.237
and have a little fiery
drink with us, eh? Uh...

33:58.245 --> 34:00.281
It's fine. Come on.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.370
Tj: You know you want to!

34:03.083 --> 34:05.916
Oh, I can see why.
Woman: You're lovely.

34:05.919 --> 34:07.750
Isn't he lovely?
Have you smelt him?

34:07.754 --> 34:09.790
He smells lovely!

34:09.797 --> 34:12.630
Can you believe Kat
gets to shag this guy?

34:12.634 --> 34:17.469
No, really, you should send god a bottle
of wine or a quiche or something.

34:22.601 --> 34:25.764
Look at those buns.
Fresh from the bakery.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.599
It must feel great getting
paid just for being you.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.022
Who says I'm being me?
Excuse me.

34:33.029 --> 34:37.443
Amy, thank you for granting me a rare
glimpse into a timeless female ritual.

34:37.449 --> 34:41.112
Here's to the husbands who've won
you, the losers who've lost you

34:41.121 --> 34:44.579
and the lucky bastards
who've yet to meet you.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.873
And to the cock in the henhouse.

35:18.617 --> 35:23.156
I can't believe you found
him first. I am so depressed.

35:23.163 --> 35:26.405
Will somebody buy
my hoo-hah a drink?

35:30.920 --> 35:34.003
You remember when we took the girls
hiking in the lake district?

35:34.007 --> 35:35.463
No. You do!

35:35.467 --> 35:38.459
Blistering heat in the
morning, rained all afternoon.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.835
No.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.963
You backed your car
over a copper's bicycle.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.636
Sorry, no. The rat and gherkin.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.181
Splendid local scrumpy. Mmm.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.304
Amy wore that
little bikini thing.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.273
But somehow it was Kat
that got stung by nettles.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.689
Kat never said a word until Amy
caught her scratching her arse.

35:56.696 --> 36:01.190
Then you rubbed it with a dock
leaf to bring down the swelling.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.242
Yeah, I remember it.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.954
I didn't deserve her back then.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.749
And you do now?

36:18.885 --> 36:20.921
What is his problem?

36:22.597 --> 36:26.010
What? There's something
about him I don't like.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.384
He's less than 9% body fat
and he's shagging your ex.

36:29.396 --> 36:31.387
No, that is not it. Look at him,

36:31.898 --> 36:35.857
he's walking around all American,
like he owns the place.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.609
Oh, no!

36:46.955 --> 36:49.241
Man: Come on,
this is your last chance.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.849
Woody?

37:15.024 --> 37:18.892
Not yet, but it's getting there!
Kat: It's getting there!

37:21.030 --> 37:23.988
Oh, my god! What
are you doing here?

37:25.618 --> 37:29.486
I thought you were in San
Francisco, or was it Nepal?

37:29.914 --> 37:33.577
Close. Sydney. But it turns
out that I missed the rain.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.952
Did Kat tell you that she dumped
you because of your funky breath?

37:38.798 --> 37:40.504
She's drunk.

37:40.508 --> 37:44.376
But I didn't... I didn't
really dump you. Right?

37:45.305 --> 37:48.718
Hard. But it was understandable,

37:48.725 --> 37:50.636
you were one of the
hottest girls in school.

37:50.643 --> 37:54.511
And we know that Kat was one of
the hottest expats in school

37:54.522 --> 37:58.561
because she was voted best
eyes and brightest smile

37:58.568 --> 38:01.435
and the most likely to age well.

38:06.159 --> 38:09.071
You're my half-sister
but I whole love you.

38:15.335 --> 38:19.544
How about you get my
half-sister a seventh hole?

38:19.923 --> 38:22.460
Tequila. Tequila. Sure.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.390
Are you all right?

38:34.687 --> 38:36.928
I don't know if I can do this.

38:38.191 --> 38:40.182
The seventh hole?

38:40.193 --> 38:42.605
No! The wedding.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.942
I shouldn't be allowed
to get married. I shouldn't.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.441
What are you talking about?

38:53.164 --> 38:54.870
Tj!

38:58.211 --> 39:00.327
Tj: Come on! Come on!

39:06.177 --> 39:10.170
What's wrong with Jeffrey? As if
I would sleep with a stripper!

39:10.181 --> 39:13.048
I'm about to get married.
You have to...

39:15.979 --> 39:20.769
It's been my experience that a man
in love doesn't want a prostitute.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.604
Eddie, you did the right thing.

39:33.913 --> 39:37.326
How do you know so much

39:39.627 --> 39:41.788
about so much?

39:44.340 --> 39:46.331
I'm a hooker.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.886
I like that.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.859
Baby!

40:09.282 --> 40:10.818
Sometimes I'm down

40:11.451 --> 40:14.033
I'm level level with the ground

40:15.288 --> 40:17.074
whoa

40:18.374 --> 40:21.036
baby, you treat me

40:21.210 --> 40:22.450
bad...

40:24.339 --> 40:26.580
No, I know

40:26.925 --> 40:29.462
know you don't mean it now

40:30.970 --> 40:33.256
I just don't know
when to say bye-bye

40:34.015 --> 40:36.131
yeah

40:36.142 --> 40:37.427
uh

40:38.227 --> 40:40.309
Uh, uh

40:40.313 --> 40:42.144
uh, uh, whoa!

40:42.857 --> 40:44.472
Baby

40:45.777 --> 40:47.938
I've got that feeling, baby...

40:47.946 --> 40:51.484
I just don't feel very well.
I'm gonna go. Give us a kiss.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.700
Ladies,
how much do you rock, tj?

40:56.871 --> 40:59.578
That was a top night.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.452
Top night!

41:17.850 --> 41:19.932
She's getting married!

41:21.980 --> 41:24.187
I'm all out of love

41:24.190 --> 41:26.397
I'm so lost without you

41:26.401 --> 41:28.562
I know you were right

41:28.569 --> 41:30.901
believing for so long

41:30.905 --> 41:33.021
I'm all out of love

41:33.032 --> 41:35.318
what am I without you?

41:35.326 --> 41:37.442
I can't be too late

41:37.453 --> 41:39.739
I know I was so wrong

41:39.747 --> 41:42.113
I'm all out of love

41:42.125 --> 41:44.207
what am I without you?

41:44.210 --> 41:46.121
I can't be too late

41:46.129 --> 41:50.247
to say that I was so wrong...

42:30.631 --> 42:32.462
Are you okay?

42:49.275 --> 42:51.106
Ooh! Ow!

43:11.130 --> 43:13.917
Watch the sun rise

43:13.925 --> 43:15.961
say your goodbyes

43:15.968 --> 43:18.710
off we go

43:21.265 --> 43:24.098
some conversation

43:24.102 --> 43:26.889
no contemplation

43:26.896 --> 43:29.603
hit the road

43:31.359 --> 43:34.146
car overheats

43:34.153 --> 43:36.986
jump out of my seat

43:37.907 --> 43:41.775
on the side of the highway baby

43:42.537 --> 43:46.496
I know I don't know you

43:46.499 --> 43:50.208
but I want you so bad

43:53.005 --> 43:56.293
everyone has a secret

43:56.300 --> 43:59.667
oh, can they keep it?

43:59.679 --> 44:03.263
Oh, no, they can't

45:14.545 --> 45:15.751
Garbage man: Morning.

45:15.755 --> 45:17.211
Morning.

45:35.983 --> 45:37.974
Ahoy, there!

45:41.948 --> 45:43.609
Hi, dad.

46:13.437 --> 46:17.305
I don't know what works for you but
I brought you some black coffee

46:17.316 --> 46:21.184
and some stale crackers, egg and
cheese sandwich and a bloody Mary.

46:21.195 --> 46:25.108
That's very sweet of you. But
I need to ask you something.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.951
What happened last night?

46:36.168 --> 46:37.829
Nothing.

46:54.228 --> 46:56.059
Thanks.

47:11.746 --> 47:13.111
Is this for last night?

47:13.122 --> 47:15.363
No! How could it be?
Nothing happened.

47:15.374 --> 47:18.787
If I was gonna charge you,
I said I'd tell you first.

47:18.794 --> 47:24.084
I didn't want you to think that I
was expecting anything for free

47:24.091 --> 47:27.003
or that I was expecting
anything at all.

47:27.011 --> 47:29.673
I mean, obviously I
was expecting something

47:29.680 --> 47:33.047
or else I wouldn't have
stopped at that atm.

47:33.059 --> 47:35.892
Just so you know,
you're 300 short.

47:39.982 --> 47:43.941
Wait, you're telling me that if
something happened last night,

47:43.944 --> 47:45.559
I'd have to pay you $1,700?

47:45.571 --> 47:47.903
That's a down payment
on a Ford focus.

47:47.907 --> 47:49.738
Not dollars, pounds.

47:49.742 --> 47:52.609
Besides, it includes,
you know...

47:52.620 --> 47:54.736
That's the extra 300.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.366
Are you a boatsman, son?

48:00.378 --> 48:03.085
I am now, sir.

48:03.089 --> 48:05.956
I'm glad someone's making
use of her at last.

48:05.966 --> 48:08.127
The boat, I mean.

48:09.595 --> 48:11.961
Victor: "To defile."
Four letters.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.963
Good morning, daddy. Ah.

48:17.395 --> 48:19.260
What if I didn't want
you to do that to me?

48:19.271 --> 48:21.978
The 300's for
you doing it to me.

48:21.982 --> 48:25.600
If anything had happened, it would have
been one of the highlights, for you.

48:25.611 --> 48:29.570
But nothing did. That's why
you get to keep your money.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.444
Woman: The wedding dance is

48:32.451 --> 48:36.945
the most important dance
moment in a person's life.

48:38.207 --> 48:41.199
A room full of
friends and family,

48:41.877 --> 48:44.493
watching, smiling,

48:44.505 --> 48:47.167
betting on how long
the marriage will last.

48:48.342 --> 48:51.004
All you'll have is each other

48:51.011 --> 48:54.003
and whatever skills
you acquire today.

48:55.850 --> 48:57.556
And pair off.

49:03.399 --> 49:05.355
When marimba rhythms
start to play...

49:05.359 --> 49:07.315
Breathe. Good,
that's a nice position.

49:07.319 --> 49:09.810
Now, your left foot.
Her right foot.

49:10.614 --> 49:13.651
Good. And we'll try to
glide across the floor.

49:14.160 --> 49:17.573
Come a little bit
closer together. Moving.

49:18.205 --> 49:20.617
Trying to turn.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.956
What's the matter, Nick?

49:22.960 --> 49:24.746
Two left feet?

49:26.172 --> 49:27.753
Ohl

49:29.550 --> 49:33.338
stay with me, sway with me

49:34.096 --> 49:37.839
other dancers
may be on the floor

49:37.850 --> 49:41.513
dear, but my eyes
will see only you

49:41.520 --> 49:45.388
only you have
that magic technique

49:45.399 --> 49:49.187
when we sway I go weak

49:49.195 --> 49:52.653
I can hear the sound of violins

49:52.656 --> 49:56.399
long before it begins

49:56.785 --> 50:00.198
make me thrill
as only you know how

50:00.206 --> 50:04.290
sway me smooth, sway me now

50:04.543 --> 50:07.376
like a flower
bending in the breeze

50:07.379 --> 50:11.463
bend with me, sway with ease

50:11.884 --> 50:15.502
when we dance you
have a way with me

50:15.513 --> 50:19.472
stay with me, sway with me

50:19.642 --> 50:22.725
like a flower bending
in the breeze

50:22.728 --> 50:26.767
bend with me, sway with ease

50:27.316 --> 50:31.685
when we dance
you have a way with me

50:33.239 --> 50:36.231
when I told you I'd never
done a wedding before,

50:36.408 --> 50:39.400
it wasn't because
I'd never been asked.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.071
I'd just never said yes.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.661
Why'd you say yes to me?

50:49.088 --> 50:52.251
There was something in your
voice on the phone that day.

50:54.260 --> 50:56.251
Desperation?

50:57.680 --> 50:59.420
I think it was hope.

50:59.640 --> 51:03.098
Get a move on, you lovebirds. I'm
getting married in the morning.

51:32.006 --> 51:33.496
Ah, hello, Bambi.

51:33.507 --> 51:35.839
Darling, please don't do that.

51:42.850 --> 51:44.841
Oh, wow.

51:46.395 --> 51:48.386
That's a big bed.

52:03.912 --> 52:06.153
You know what pisses me off?

52:06.415 --> 52:10.408
I've been spilling my guts all weekend
and I don't know anything about you.

52:12.921 --> 52:15.162
I'm allergic to fabric softener.

52:16.300 --> 52:20.669
I'm majoring in comparative literature
at brown. I hate anchovies.

52:22.014 --> 52:25.006
I think I'd miss you
even if we'd never met.

52:32.524 --> 52:34.435
Come on!

52:39.782 --> 52:43.491
Ed: I'm a little concerned... I'm just...
It makes me nervous...

52:43.494 --> 52:46.986
Tj: You know,
I might just call you.

52:47.706 --> 52:51.870
But if I did, I would lose, because
my hand is complete shite.

52:51.877 --> 52:53.367
Ohhh.

52:55.297 --> 52:56.707
I'm in. Come on.

52:56.715 --> 52:59.047
There's gotta be
something wrong with him.

52:59.051 --> 53:02.543
I bet his thingy bends, doesn't it?
Got a little kink in it.

53:02.554 --> 53:05.671
Oh, no, don't tell me.
It's bloody perfect.

53:06.433 --> 53:09.049
I'm going to see you.

53:11.021 --> 53:13.353
Looky, looky here.

53:13.357 --> 53:15.848
A full house.

53:15.859 --> 53:18.020
Oh, ho, ho!

53:18.028 --> 53:22.067
Has anyone seen my future wife? She'll
kill me if I don't serve her first.

53:22.074 --> 53:25.566
Have you guys ever had a real
honest-to-god fight, ever?

53:25.577 --> 53:28.068
Yes, of course. Yeah, right.

53:28.580 --> 53:32.289
Well, apparently, makeup
sex is the best kind.

53:32.292 --> 53:34.328
Not that I'm ever
going to find out.

53:34.336 --> 53:35.701
Give me that!

53:37.047 --> 53:39.254
Come on! No, nol!

53:39.258 --> 53:41.249
Don't! Come on!

53:45.931 --> 53:48.638
You seem to have
a way with women.

53:49.643 --> 53:52.760
Why don't you go and rustle up the bride?
Get her to join the party.

53:56.859 --> 54:00.397
Amy: Why are you bringing
this up now? I love ed.

54:00.404 --> 54:03.612
What do you want from me?
I want you to tell me...

54:07.745 --> 54:11.408
Blue shirt or white shirt for
the, er, rehearsal dinner?

54:17.129 --> 54:18.790
Sorry to interrupt.

54:19.965 --> 54:22.126
Your dad sent me.

54:22.468 --> 54:24.459
What for?

54:25.345 --> 54:27.506
To make sure you're okay.

54:32.811 --> 54:35.473
Kat, could I have a word?
It'll only take a moment.

54:35.481 --> 54:39.941
Let me think. You stole seven years of her
life with your bullshit and your charm

54:39.943 --> 54:41.854
and now you'd like
just a moment?

54:41.862 --> 54:44.444
Sure. Go right ahead.

54:48.744 --> 54:52.828
Thanks for the solidarity, mum, but
next time a little less information.

54:54.666 --> 54:56.827
Do you believe a
place has a memory?

54:57.336 --> 55:02.876
Even before ed and I started dating, we
all used to come up here in the summer

55:02.883 --> 55:04.874
and spend weekends.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.973
God, I hope it doesn't
remember everything.

55:18.941 --> 55:21.683
No matter how certain
one is of one's position

55:21.693 --> 55:23.934
of what one should
or shouldn't do,

55:23.946 --> 55:26.153
one sometimes discovers

55:26.156 --> 55:31.367
that one is not as one would
have hoped one would have been.

55:31.370 --> 55:34.908
What exactly are you trying to say?
I'm sorry.

55:34.915 --> 55:38.533
Look, I feel like I
need to tell you something.

55:38.544 --> 55:42.128
You're not even listening. I'm sorry.
I'll be back in a minute.

55:49.054 --> 55:52.171
Hey, is everything okay?

55:55.644 --> 55:57.225
Yeah.

55:59.857 --> 56:01.563
Yeah.

56:07.072 --> 56:08.858
Victor: Anchovy, Nick?

56:09.032 --> 56:11.068
I remember the day I met Kat.

56:11.326 --> 56:13.066
It was in New York.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.368
I'd been seeing bunny
for a few months

56:15.372 --> 56:20.036
and she finally trusted me
enough to meet her kid.

56:20.210 --> 56:23.077
So I'm over at her place

56:23.630 --> 56:26.838
and in walks this
little monster.

56:27.885 --> 56:30.217
That was it. I was a goner.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.754
That was the day I became a dad.

56:34.766 --> 56:39.100
You know, Nick, you think it's going
to get easier as they get older,

56:39.104 --> 56:42.096
that you're going to
worry about them less.

56:43.275 --> 56:46.938
Or that you're going to
trust the world more.

56:47.779 --> 56:49.940
But that's just
not how it happens.

57:01.793 --> 57:04.876
This may not make
much sense to you, sir,

57:04.880 --> 57:08.714
but I'd like to ask your
permission to date your daughter.

57:11.303 --> 57:13.294
I thought you already were.

57:28.654 --> 57:31.316
I blame...

57:31.323 --> 57:34.065
I blame Tony peepants. No.

57:34.076 --> 57:35.907
Let's have the story.
Kat, come on.

57:35.911 --> 57:39.995
No. I have to initiate
Nick into our family.

57:39.998 --> 57:45.868
I blame Tony for why my two girls just
don't seem to be able to get along.

57:46.088 --> 57:49.876
Don't deny it. You barely
tolerate each other.

57:49.883 --> 57:54.217
Come on. It's true. The only thing you've got
in common is you're both attracted to me.

57:54.221 --> 57:56.086
It started after we moved here.

57:56.098 --> 58:00.888
My two girls got into a fight over Tony
peepants and have never made up since.

58:00.894 --> 58:03.431
Apparently, Kat and
I were inseparable.

58:03.438 --> 58:06.054
If Kat ate a banana,
Amy threw it up.

58:06.066 --> 58:08.182
If Amy threw it up, Kat ate it.

58:09.528 --> 58:14.238
So we were eating and throwing
up together in Harmony

58:14.241 --> 58:16.732
until Tony walked me home
from school one day.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.199
He was my first boyfriend.

58:18.203 --> 58:21.787
Tony ignored Kat because
he wanted to play with me.

58:21.790 --> 58:25.453
Anyway, the point of the story is that
Tony ended up with a chair in his face.

58:25.460 --> 58:28.577
It was plastic and child-sized.

58:29.589 --> 58:35.129
As I recall, there were stitches involved.
Come on, bunny, 15 stitches.

58:35.137 --> 58:37.594
So is that when he
peed in his pants?

58:37.597 --> 58:40.760
He cried a lot, but
there was no peeing.

58:40.767 --> 58:42.974
So what's with the nickname?

58:47.315 --> 58:49.601
I have absolutely no idea.

58:52.571 --> 58:54.562
Let me get some more wine.

58:55.490 --> 58:57.731
Tj: Would you marry
me if I asked?

58:57.743 --> 59:00.075
That was a yes.
Did you see that?

59:10.922 --> 59:15.131
And you know, I thought perhaps you...
Bollocks. Sorry.

59:15.886 --> 59:20.676
I had no idea this would be so difficult. I
just feel like I owe you an explanation.

59:20.682 --> 59:23.424
Relax, relax. It's fine.

59:24.352 --> 59:26.343
I promise.

59:28.857 --> 59:33.271
And I should probably
admit that,

59:34.905 --> 59:38.773
I brought Nick with me
to torture you, slowly,

59:39.201 --> 59:41.192
for the entire weekend.

59:42.162 --> 59:46.121
But then, I don't know,
something happened and now...

59:46.124 --> 59:50.834
I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings
but I'm just sick of you and me.

59:51.671 --> 59:57.462
Of our whole story, so come on, let's
just go upstairs and eat some tiramisu.

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:03.509
I slept with your sister.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:17.485
I'm sorry? Well, I shagged
Amy, two years ago.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:20.322
That's why I broke
it off with you.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:26.078
And then after you left, sod it,
we kept at it like rabbits,

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:31.201
until we both realized it was absolutely
mad and, obviously, morally wrong.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.504
And then that was it.

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:41.302
But last Christmas,
when ed proposed,

01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:46.007
I realized I'm in love with her.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.640
Good lord, say
something, please.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:13.166
Oh, my god, he's
told you, hasn't he?

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.162
You knew? Kat, I'm so sorry.
I'm so...

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:29.637
Kat. Kat, please.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.431
Kat, please don't say anything.

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:38.274
I can't believe you told her.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.263
What's going on?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.221
Nothing.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.473
It doesn't look like nothing.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:22.064
Now is not the
time to catch on, ed.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:27.274
Okay. Good.

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:43.123
Leave me alone. You knew
and you didn't tell me.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:46.673
Wait up. I can't
believe I trusted you.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.837
Come on. You've
got to stop running.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:51.385
How could you not have told me?

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.258
What did you expect me to say?

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.973
You let me make
a fool of myself.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:03:01.149
You lied to me, but I guess I shouldn't
be surprised because that's what you do.

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:03.313
That's who you are.
You're a liar.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.322
You're judging me?
That's a good one.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:09.532
You're going to
point a finger at me,

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.323
the guy that you hired to
pretend to be your boyfriend?

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:18.120
You're right. I was so desperate to
make everyone believe that I was happy

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.665
that I paid $6,000 for a lie.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:25.836
And, at the end of the day, the only one
who ended up falling for it was me.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:28.760
I wish I could say
it was worth it.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:32.964
Go ahead, Kat, hate me.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:37.640
I think you're running out of steam
on this whole Jeffrey thing anyhow.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:40.184
Maybe now you'll be able to
hold on to this long enough

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.773
to ruin your next relationship.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:00.330
Nick. I'm just
checking into a hotel.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:02.919
Don't be ridiculous. It's late.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:05.914
Take the car.

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:16.596
Actually, the
boathouse is empty.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:22.223
Look, I don't know what's going on with
you two but I'm sure you'll work it out.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:30.856
You couldn't be more perfect if
she'd picked you out of a catalog.

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:37.946
Thanks, ed.

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:50.087
Hey.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.759
Hey.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.392
I just...

01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:03.935
I wanted to say thank you for
not outing me in front of ed.

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:11.150
I want to tell him, just not
the night before our wedding.

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:14.782
You know, with these things,
timing is everything.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.744
You're right.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.587
You should time it right,

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:33.677
so that when he hears that you
repeatedly screwed his best friend,

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.138
he won't feel like the world is
collapsing and there's no escape

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:40.350
because you tricked
him into marrying you.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.731
Kat... don't worry. Your
wedding will be perfect.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:55.072
Tomorrow I'll say all the right things and
you'll deal with ed when you're ready.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:06:00.699
But right now, tonight, I'm not
going to pretend it's okay.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:17.170
And that's your
first flight out?

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:19.343
Another summer day
has come and gone away

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:20.806
all right, thanks.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.141
In Paris and Rome

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.806
I wanna go home

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:29.854
mmm

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:34.984
another aeroplane
another sunny place

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.027
I'm lucky, I know

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:39.276
but I wanna go home

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:43.242
mmm, I've got to go home

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:47.867
and I feel just
like I'm living...

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.085
I'm okay.

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:50.749
Someone else's life

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.964
it's like I just
stepped outside...

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.335
I don't believe you.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.091
I'm fine, really.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:05.802
Nothing a bottle of Jack and a
straight razor couldn't fix.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.983
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.396
It's Amy's day.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.664
Get in the car, darling.

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.758
No, no. Smile.

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:12.000
Hello.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.622
I've been looking for you.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:24.305
So, why did you let him go?

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.813
It's complicated, dad. Right.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:36.145
It probably wouldn't have
worked out anyway, huh?

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:45.448
I remember reading a fascinating article
in the New York times magazine once,

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.953
where this guy said,

01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:52.876
"every woman has the exact
love life she wants."

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:57.162
You know what? I agree with him.

01:08:58.343 --> 01:09:01.881
But I refuse to believe that
this is what you want, Kat.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.883
Ever since you were little,

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:08.550
you've always worried about
what other people think.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:14.564
Now, come on. What do you think?
Is he the guy for you?

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:22.897
Then go and get him.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:55.221
Hello, darling. Your mother said
you wanted to have a quick word.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:57.224
No, no, no, I...

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:04.906
There's something you should
know before you marry me.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.316
What is it?

01:10:56.961 --> 01:11:00.044
I wanted to tell you but I was
afraid you'd never forgive me

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:02.459
and I just...
I love you so much.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:05.462
I'm sorry.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.962
I knew you were seeing someone
else when we finally got together,

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.715
but not Jeffrey.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:16.265
Does Kat know?

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:19.604
Jeffrey told her last night.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.945
Excuse me.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.618
Jeffrey: Ed?

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:44.042
Ed... calm down, ed.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.460
Ed!

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:48.963
Ed: Tj!

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.975
Ah!

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:05.268
Ed, calm down! It's all sorted!
She wants you!

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:07.941
I've given up!
What's the problem?

01:12:07.949 --> 01:12:10.156
You back-stabbing weasel!

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:13.947
That's not fair. It was before
you guys were even dating.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:17.243
But you were engaged
to her sister.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.957
Ed, calm down!

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:24.583
We can talk about this like
civilized human beings.

01:12:31.722 --> 01:12:34.213
I look like a total
wanker, don't 1?

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:35.840
Yeah, kind of.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:46.313
Get in the car, ed. He's
halfway to France by now.

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:48.526
Whoa!

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:01.870
Ed: I trust you've enjoyed
your trip to england.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.540
Yeah, it was fantastic.
Thanks, Eddie.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.667
You know, I felt sorry
for you last night.

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:16.722
I was just sitting there like some smug
arse, thinking, "aren't I a lucky sod?"

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:23.938
I forgave her when I thought
it was just some random bloke.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.559
But not Jeffrey.

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:34.278
I've had her up on
a pedestal ever since,

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:40.200
ever since I put her up there.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.287
What a mess I've made, huh?

01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:58.548
I'm so sorry.

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:07.564
The hardest thing's
loving someone

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:10.810
and then having the courage
to let them love you back.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:20.494
But if you know her shit
and she knows yours

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:24.867
and at the end of the day, you still
would rather give up than try,

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:31.171
nothing's ever
gonna be worth it.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:40.089
Maybe think about it this way.

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:42.724
You go back,

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:46.604
you get to spend the rest of your
life having really great makeup sex.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.981
Ed? Ed: Must run!

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:55.904
Hi.

01:14:58.119 --> 01:14:59.780
Hi.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:06.992
Last night, when we were fighting,
I thought this was over.

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:14.173
And I was going to leave you
alone and just take off but...

01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:22.804
Then I realized I'd rather fight with
you than make love with anyone else.

01:15:53.674 --> 01:15:56.711
I should get going.
What? No, you can't.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.675
I have to.

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:00.677
I'm the best man.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:18.153
You can dance

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:21.820
every dance with the guy
who gives you the eye

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.113
let him hold you tight

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:27.245
and you can smile

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:30.707
every smile for the man
who held your hand

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:33.748
beneath the pale moonlight

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:37.169
but don't forget
who's taking you home

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:40.134
and in whose arms
you're gonna be

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:46.345
so darling
save the last dance for me

01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:49.977
oh, I know

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.973
that the music's fine
like sparkling wine

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.600
go and have your fun

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.145
laugh and sing...

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.236
Let's do it.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:01.572
But while we're apart

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:05.614
don't give your heart to anyone

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:12.579
and in whose arms
you're gonna be

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:18.040
so darling
save the last dance for me

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:25.384
ed, there's no one
in the world who knows

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:28.178
how to love my baby
sister better than you.

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:30.392
Be good to one another.

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:32.432
To Amy and ed.

01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:34.771
All: Amy and ed.

01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:40.524
You can dance

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:44.115
go and carry on
till the night is gone

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:47.406
and it's time to go

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:49.654
if he asks

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:53.078
if you're all alone
can he walk you home

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:55.542
you must tell him no

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:59.588
cos don't forget
who's taking you home

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:03.050
and in whose arms
you're gonna be

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:10.137
save the last dance for me

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:11.930
oh, I know

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:15.555
that the music's fine
like sparkling wine

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:17.932
go and have your fun

01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:20.400
laugh and sing

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:22.861
but while we're apart

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:26.824
don't give your heart to anyone

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:31.119
and don't forget
who's taking you home

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:34.911
and in whose arms
you're gonna be

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.126
so darling

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:40.917
save the last dance for me

01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:44.588
save the last dance

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:47.758
the very last dance

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:49.301
for me

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.616
Another summer day

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:15.956
has come and gone away

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.791
in Paris and Rome

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:19.911
but I wanna go home

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:25.382
oh

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:30.797
Maybe surrounded
by a million people, I...

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:34.801
Still feel alone
just wanna go home

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.142
oh, I miss you, you know

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:46.320
and I've been keeping all the
letters that I wrote to you

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:51.659
each one a line or two

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:54.620
"I'm fine, baby, how are you?"

01:19:55.874 --> 01:20:01.494
Well, I would send them but I
know that it's just not enough

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:05.918
my words were cold and flat

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:10.795
and you deserve more than that

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.633
another aeroplane

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.475
another sunny place

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.845
I'm lucky, I know

01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:23.145
but I wanna go home

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:26.019
mm, I've got to go home

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.902
let me go home

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:38.539
I'm just too far
from where you are

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:40.783
I wanna come home

01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:03.147
And I feel just like
I'm living someone else's life

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.818
it's like I just stepped outside

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:11.401
when everything was going right

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:17.908
and I know just why you
could not come along with me

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.579
but this was not your dream

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:27.497
but you always believed in me

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:34.470
another winter day
has come and gone away

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:36.634
and even Paris and Rome

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:39.429
and I wanna go home

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.887
let me go home

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:49.518
and I'm surrounded
by a million people, I...

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:53.944
I still feel alone,
let me go home

01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:58.277
oh, I miss you, you know

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:02.914
let me go home

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.917
I've had my run

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.755
baby, I'm done

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.966
I gotta go home

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:17.884
let me go home

01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:24.303
it will all be all right

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.807
I'll be home tonight

01:22:28.569 --> 01:22:31.982
I'm coming back home
