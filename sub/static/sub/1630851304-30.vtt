IS WINNING THIS SEASON.

06:39.966 --> 06:44.537
I THINK THE ONLY PART THAT MAKES
IT UNDERSTANDABLE IS THAT WE'RE

GOING TO BE THE HARDEST PART.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.375

AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME, THE
COOKOUT IS TARGETING ITS OWN

OF WINNING ARE BETTER SITTING

07:00.987 --> 07:08.060

AZAH OR HANNAH, SIMPLY FROM A

07:08.060 --> 07:08.628

MAKE SURE WE HAVE HIS BACK.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.872
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

07:19.872 --> 07:23.142
HE COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY PUT
ME AND YOU ON THE BLOCK.

07:23.142 --> 07:27.280
NOW THAT TIFFANY AND HANNAH ARE
ON THE BLOCK, HOPEFULLY, KYLAND

07:27.280 --> 07:31.584
DOESN'T TRY TO DO ANY TRICKY
STUFF, AND ALL US GUYS ARE

07:31.584 --> 07:34.520

THE END.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.589
AT THIS POINT, WE PROBABLY JUST
DREW A LINE.

07:36.589 --> 07:37.590

07:44.697 --> 07:47.934

07:47.934 --> 07:49.602

EXPECTING.

07:49.602 --> 07:53.906
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I KIND OF FELT
LIKE I WAS GOING UP, BUT I

07:53.906 --> 07:56.676
DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING UP.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.277
YOU'LL BE FINE.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.646

FINE.

08:00.646 --> 08:04.650

DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS

08:04.650 --> 08:06.886
GAME I TRUST, BESIDES YOU.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.957

08:14.093 --> 08:16.963

PUT "X" UP ON THE BLOCK TODAY,

08:19.098 --> 08:22.134

IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE WOMEN IN

11:11.537 --> 11:14.473
"X," AND SO NOW I'M AT A
CROSSROADS.

11:14.473 --> 11:17.543
THIS WEEK I NEED TO DECIDE
WHETHER I ROLL WITH THE WOMEN

11:17.543 --> 11:19.745
LIKE I WANTED OR ROLL WITH THE
MEN.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.448
BUT BEFORE I MAKE THAT DECISION,
I HAVE TO WIN THE VETO.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.683
>> IF ONE OF THEM WINS H.O.H.

11:24.683 --> 11:29.488
NEXT WEEK, YOU AND I HIT THE
BLOCK, ONE OF US GOES HOME.

11:29.488 --> 11:43.002
WHICH IS WHY ME, YOU, AND
TIFFANY NEED TO WIN VETO.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.404
>> YEAH, I WANT TO TALK.

11:45.404 --> 11:46.806
>> OKAY.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.141
I'M ON THE BLOCK.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.710
I HONESTLY THINK IT WAS
INEVITABLE.

11:51.710 --> 11:56.348
THE GUYS DEFINITELY WANT ME OUT
OF HERE.

11:56.348 --> 12:03.155
THE ONLY THING I AM EMOTIONAL
ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT IT'S MY

12:03.155 --> 12:04.190
SON'S BIRTHDAY.

12:04.190 --> 12:08.994
I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

12:08.994 --> 12:13.065
I HAVE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT HOW
WINNING "BIG BROTHER" WOULD BE

12:13.065 --> 12:16.001
LIFE CHANGING FOR MYSELF AND MY
SON.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.336
$750,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY.

12:17.336 --> 12:18.771
THAT IS WHY I'M HERE.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.674
I KNOW I'M KYLAND'S TARGET, AND
MY BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL.

12:21.674 --> 12:25.377
IF I DON'T WIN THIS VETO, MY
GAME IS OVER.

12:25.377 --> 12:29.815
SO THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT I
CAN OFFER MY SON IS TO BRING

12:29.815 --> 12:32.251
HOME THE VETO!

12:32.251 --> 12:34.353
ULTIMATELY, I WANT TO WIN.

12:34.353 --> 12:39.391
I HAVE A SON THAT I WANT AND I
NEED TO PROVIDE FOR.

12:39.391 --> 12:41.393

13:56.101 --> 14:01.707
THEN FLY DOWN THE ZIP LINE TO
SNEAK PEEK INSIDE THE B.B. COMIC

14:01.707 --> 14:02.908

IT CAN BE TRICKY SPOTTING A REAL

WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE ALL 16
AUTHENTIC COMICS PLACED IN THE

IF YOU ARE INCORRECT, A BUZZER

14:52.491 --> 14:55.394

TIFFANY PACKING.

14:55.394 --> 15:00.099

FINALLY WANT TO WIN SOMETHING IN

15:00.099 --> 15:04.403
THIS GAME
( HORN SOUNDS )

15:04.403 --> 15:09.375
NOT ONLY DO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT THESE 16 COMICS ARE IN THE

15:09.375 --> 15:12.911
RIGHT ORDER... OH, GOD.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.980

BOOKS THAT HAVE SUBTLE

15:14.980 --> 15:16.148
DIFFERENCE.

15:16.148 --> 15:19.385
SO I NEED TO GO UP ON THAT ZIP

15:19.385 --> 15:21.987

15:21.987 --> 15:23.188
BRITINI AND ALYSSA.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.324
BEFORE I FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
DIFFERENCES ARE, I WANT TO MAKE

15:25.324 --> 15:28.093

THEIR ORDER.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.295
OKAY.

15:29.295 --> 15:30.663
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MEMORIZE
EVERYTHING, I'M JUST GOING TO

15:30.663 --> 15:34.300
FOCUS ON THREE COMICS AT A TIME.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.702
I CAN'T GET OVER THESE COMICS!

15:36.702 --> 15:39.405
I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP DOING
THIS PROCESS UNTIL I HAVE THEM

15:39.405 --> 15:44.877
ALL UP THERE DISPLAYED ON MY
LAPTOP.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.379
NOT ME BOOING A SNOOZE-FEST.

15:47.846 --> 15:51.050
THAT IS MY POWER.

15:51.050 --> 15:51.784
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.185
YOU LOOK REALLY MUSCULAR AND
BIG.

15:53.185 --> 15:56.455
AS A VILLAIN, I'M TRYING TO
DESTROY THE WORLD.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.624
ACTUALLY, I'M TRYING TO DESTROY
MY HOUSEGUESTS

15:58.624 --> 16:07.399
( LAUGHS )
CHRISTIAN, HANNAH, AND WHITNEY.

16:07.399 --> 16:11.303
CHRISTIAN, HANNAH, WHITNEY!

16:11.303 --> 16:14.139
NOW THEY HAVE THE ORDER DOWN,
I'M GOING TO LOOK AT EACH

16:14.139 --> 16:16.975
COMMAND I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IS
THE DIFFERENCE IN THEM.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.177
CLAIRE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:18.177 --> 16:23.382
FOR EXAMPLE, IN CLAIRE'S COMIC
BOOK, SHE HAS ONE THAT SHE'S

16:23.382 --> 16:26.819
WEARING EARS AND ANOTHER ONE
WHERE SHE'S WEARING NO EARS.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.589
AND AFTER CLAIRE'S SPEECH ON
DOUBLE-EVICTION NIGHT, SHE

16:30.589 --> 16:31.990
DEFINITELY DESERVES THOSE CLAWS.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.592
I WILL TELL YOU THAT NOW.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.794
CHRISTIAN DOES DO A LOT OF
FLIPS.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.997
OH, CHRISTIAN'S COMIC BOOK IS
RIGHT ON POINT.

16:38.997 --> 16:42.101
WHEN HE'S NOT MAKING OUT WITH
ALYSSA, HE'S DEFINITELY

16:42.101 --> 16:43.035
FLIPPING.

16:43.035 --> 16:47.206
IN ONE VERSION, THE VILLAIN IS
WEARING SOCKS.

16:47.206 --> 16:54.413
IN THE OTHER, THE VILLAIN IS
WEARING HIS FEET.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.180
MY ARCH-NEMESIS.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.449
IN ONE VERSION HE HAS TOILET
PAPER.

16:57.449 --> 17:00.819
IN THE OTHER VERSION, HE HAS NO
TOILET PAPER.

17:00.819 --> 17:01.320
WHAT?

17:01.320 --> 17:02.321
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

17:02.321 --> 17:07.659
I SEE WHITNEY WITH HER FAMOUS
WOORK OUT OUTFIT.

17:07.659 --> 17:11.430
ARE WE SURE WE WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WHITNEY'S COMIC BOOK.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.800
SHE HAD THAT WORKUP ON THE TOP
ON.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.504
WOULD YOU LET YOUR KIDS READ
THIS COMIC BOOK?

17:18.504 --> 17:19.705
LOOK AT IT.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.409
YOUR HUSBAND COMES HOME WITH
THIS COMIC BOOK FOR THE KIDS, OR

17:23.409 --> 17:27.079
FOR HIMSELF.

17:27.079 --> 17:27.746
JUSTICE.

17:27.746 --> 17:28.981
I THINK FRENCHIE'S WAS A TIE.

17:28.981 --> 17:34.720
SO THEN I SEE ALYSSA'S, WHO IS
THE BIKINI JEANIE, WHICH SHE IS.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.689
AND I HAVE TO SAY, I AM SO
IMPRESSED BY HERS.

17:37.689 --> 17:41.326
SHE LOOKS AMAZING.

17:41.326 --> 17:44.830
IN ONE VERSION THE LAMP IS
FACING ALYSSA, IN THE OTHER

17:44.830 --> 17:47.399
VERSION, THE LAMP IS FACING AWAY
FROM ALYSSA.

17:47.399 --> 17:51.403
NO TOILET PAPER.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.971
HANNAH.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.239
I THINK-- I THINK SO.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.509
I THINK I GOT ALL MY COMIC BOOKS
RIGHT, SO I'M JUST GOING TO HIT

17:57.509 --> 17:59.611
THIS BUTTON AND SEE IF I'M
CORRECT

17:59.611 --> 18:03.215
( BUZZER SOUNDS )
OKAY.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.550
SO I'M WRONG.

18:04.550 --> 18:09.188
SO NOW I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHICH ONE OF THESE IS CORRECT.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.758
I WASN'T SURE ABOUT TIFFANY, SO
I'M JUST GOING TO SWITCH THAT

18:12.758 --> 18:17.496
AND THEN BUZZ IN AGAIN
( BELL RINGS )

18:17.496 --> 18:18.464
WOOO!

18:18.464 --> 18:20.833
OF COURSE I GET STUCK ON
TIFFANY'S COMIC BOOK.

18:20.833 --> 18:25.471
SHE'S EVEN COMING FOR ME IN A
COMIC BOOK!

18:25.471 --> 18:25.871
OW!

18:25.871 --> 18:31.910
LET'S HIT IT!

18:31.910 --> 18:36.048

18:36.048 --> 18:38.917

KEEPS ALL OF THE POWER IN MY

HANDS.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.087
AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE I HAVE
FULL CONTROL.

18:42.087 --> 18:47.392
THAT WAY I CAN ENSURE THAT MY
TARGET, TIFFANY, GOES HOME THIS

18:47.392 --> 18:56.268
WEEK.

18:56.268 --> 18:59.371
I'M TRYING REALLY HARD NOT TO
GET DISTRACTED BY THESE COMIC

18:59.371 --> 19:04.610
BOOK COVERS, BECAUSE I AM SUCH A
HUGE SUPERHERO FAN.

19:04.610 --> 19:11.450
KNOWING THAT I'M GOING TO BE A
B.B. SUPERHERO WITH MY OWN COMIC

19:11.450 --> 19:14.953
IS MIND BLOWING.

19:14.953 --> 19:15.287
WHITNEY.

19:15.287 --> 19:16.388
BIKINI...

19:16.388 --> 19:18.323
THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IS
GET THE ORDER CORRECT.

19:18.323 --> 19:22.694
THEN I CAN FOCUS ON FINDING THE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE IMAGES.

19:22.694 --> 19:23.495
DAMN, IT'S HARD.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.464
I'M TRYING TO FIND THESE
DIFFERENCES.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.065
SEEING MY COMIC IS PRETTY
EXCITING.

19:27.065 --> 19:30.102
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER WORN A
KILT BEFORE, BUT SINCE THEY GAVE

19:30.102 --> 19:33.972
ME A BODY LIKE XAVIER'S, I THINK
IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

19:33.972 --> 19:37.042
IN ONE VERSION OF MY COMIC I'M
WEARING A GREEN SASH.

19:37.042 --> 19:41.346
IN THE OTHER, I'M WEARING A
PURPLE SASH.

19:41.346 --> 19:45.484
IF I SAW A FLIGHT ATTENDANT LIKE
THAT, I THINK I MIGHT OPT FOR A

19:45.484 --> 19:51.857
TRAIN TO GET WHERE I'M GOING.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.825
HOOLA HOOP.

19:53.825 --> 19:54.960
OKAY.

19:54.960 --> 19:59.131
I LOVE THAT MY BESTIE SARAH BETH
HAS SUCH A COOL COSTUME.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.133
GET IT... COOL?

20:01.133 --> 20:03.769
IN ONE VERSION OF S.B.'S COMIC
SHE'S WEARING A CAPE.

20:03.769 --> 20:07.172
IN THE OTHER VERSION, SHE'S NOT
WEARING A CAPE.

20:07.172 --> 20:10.275
RIGHT NOW, I'M FEELING PRETTY
CONFIDENT ABOUT MOST OF MY

20:10.275 --> 20:11.543
COMICS I HAVE UP.

20:11.543 --> 20:15.380
HOWEVER, I HAVE YET TO IDENTIFY
THE DIFFERENCES OF THOSE ON THE

20:15.380 --> 20:16.615
FAR RIGHT.

20:16.615 --> 20:22.154
I PUT MY BEST GUESS ON FRONT,
RUN PAST THE BUZZER, HIT IT JUST

20:22.154 --> 20:26.458
IN CASE
( BUZZER SOUNDS )

20:26.458 --> 20:28.026
ANYTHING ELSE?

20:28.026 --> 20:31.029
NOPE.

20:31.029 --> 20:33.265
I REALIZE THE ONE THAT'S WRONG
IS WHITNEY'S.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.968
THE MAKEUP ON HER EYE NEEDS TO
BE A SPADE NOT A HEART.

20:35.968 --> 20:41.373
NOW I JUST NEED TO SWITCH THAT
OUT AND BUZZ IN

20:41.373 --> 20:48.513
( BELL RINGS )
( HORN BLOWS )

20:48.513 --> 20:53.352
>> IF I WIN THE VETO THIS WEEK,
I CAN TAKE TIFFANY OR HANNAH OFF

20:53.352 --> 20:56.488
THE BLOCK AND HAVE TWO VOTES
NEEDED TO KEEP A GIRL IN THE

20:56.488 --> 20:58.924
HOUSE AND SEND A GUY HOME.

20:58.924 --> 21:07.099
SO I NEED THE POWER OF VETO TO
MAKE THAT DECISION.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.968
I LOVE MY COMIC.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.103
MY BOOBS LOOK GREAT.

21:11.103 --> 21:20.879
I REALLY LIKE MY BOOBS.

21:20.879 --> 21:24.549
BRITINI'S COMIC IS THE DENIA
DENIALATO.

21:24.549 --> 21:25.417
THIS BRINGS BACK MEMORIES.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.986
OR SHOULD I SAY NIGHTMARES.

21:27.986 --> 21:33.659
THAT BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM
( SCREAMING )

21:33.659 --> 21:35.027
THAT HAIR WHIPPING BACK AND
FORTH.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.195
WHO CAN FORGET THIS ICONIC
MOMENT.

21:37.195 --> 21:40.399
I FEEL LIKE I'M ABLE TO SEE THE
DIFFERENCES IN THE COMICS PRETTY

21:40.399 --> 21:41.633
EASILY.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.269
FRENCHIE IS WEARING A BOTIE IN
ONE B.B. COMIC AND A NECK TIE IN

21:44.269 --> 21:45.504
THE OTHER.

21:45.504 --> 21:49.207
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE MOST OF THE
COMICS CORRECT, BUT I CAN'T SEEM

21:49.207 --> 21:54.179
TO FIND THE DIFFERENCES IN
BRITINI'S, SARAH BETH'S, AND

21:54.179 --> 21:57.783
HANNAH'S.

21:57.783 --> 22:00.619
( BUZZER SOUNDS )
>> I BUZZ IN, AND IT'S WRONG,

22:00.619 --> 22:04.256
AND I REALIZE I NEED TO DOUBLE
CHECK BRITINI'S COMIC.

22:04.256 --> 22:04.589
OH!

22:04.589 --> 22:05.223
OF COURSE!

22:05.223 --> 22:08.994
THE TAG LINES ARE DIFFERENT.

22:08.994 --> 22:15.701
THE DENIAL-ATO TAG LINE NEEDS TO
BE, "JUSTICE WON'T BE DENIED.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.002
SO I NEED TO SWAP IT OUT
( BUZZER SOUNDS )

22:17.002 --> 22:18.704
I BUZZ IN AND IT'S WRONG AGAIN.

22:18.704 --> 22:22.574
THE ONLY ONES I'M NOT SURE ABOUT
ARE SARAH BETH'S AND HANNAH'S.

22:22.574 --> 22:26.578
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE MORE
LOOK.

22:26.578 --> 22:28.914
I DON'T KNOW HOW I DIDN'T SEE
THIS BEFORE.

22:28.914 --> 22:33.652
SARAH BETH IS WEARING A CAPE IN
ONE COMIC AND NOT IN THE OTHER.

22:33.652 --> 22:37.456
I STILL CAN'T QUITE SEE WHAT IS
DIFFERENT ABOUT HANNAH'S COMIC.

22:37.456 --> 22:41.059
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS THE
ONLY ONE I HAVE WRONG, SO I'M

22:41.059 --> 22:45.497
GOING TO SWITCH IT OUT AND BUZZ
IT AGAIN.

22:45.497 --> 22:54.005
( BELL RINGS )
( HORN BLOWS )

22:54.005 --> 22:56.942
>> I NEED TO WIN THIS VETO FOR
TWO REASONS.

22:56.942 --> 23:00.045
ONE, I WANT TO ADD ANOTHER
COMPETITION WIN TO MY RESUME.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.548
AND, TWO, TO KEEP NOMINATIONS
THE SAME TO ENSURE THAT TIFFANY

23:03.548 --> 23:10.989
MOST LIKELY GOES HOME.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.357
THE EXPLORER.

23:12.357 --> 23:12.758
ALL RIGHT!

23:12.758 --> 23:13.959
I'LL TAKE IT.

23:13.959 --> 23:18.997
I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL SEASON
LONG TO SEE WHAT MY B.B. COMIC

23:18.997 --> 23:21.800
THE EXPLORER, "X" MARKS THE
SPOT, AND IT'S A TRIBUTE TO THE

23:21.800 --> 23:26.571
VETO COMPETITION I WON, DOMINO
NEATH.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.740
DAMN, ALYSSA!

23:28.740 --> 23:31.910
THE BIKINI JEANIE MAKES ME FEEL
SOME TYPE OF WAY.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.545
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

23:33.545 --> 23:37.182
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU
PHILANTHROPISTO-NITE.

23:37.182 --> 23:43.021
PROUD OF YOU.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.256
TOP ROW.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.459
"D," GLAMOUR, HANNAH.

23:47.459 --> 23:48.760
THIS AIN'T EASY.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.362
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE, TIFFANY?

23:50.362 --> 23:53.598
EVEN IF YOU'RE GOOD AT THINGS
INVOLVING ATTENTION TO DETAIL,

23:53.598 --> 23:58.036
YOU'RE NEVER DOING ATTENTION TO
DETAIL WITH THINGS THAT INVOLVE

23:58.036 --> 24:02.574
A ZIP LINE, A LAPTOP, CRAZY
COMIC BOOKS.

24:02.574 --> 24:06.611
( BUZZER SOUNDS )
I THINK THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT

24:06.611 --> 24:07.546
ORDER.

24:07.546 --> 24:08.280
LET'S LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS
ABOUT EACH ONE.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.415
I FEEL LIKE THE ORDER IS
CORRECT.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.551
JUST FOR KICKS AND GIGGLES...

( BUZZER SOUNDS )
( BUZZER SOUNDS )

24:19.090 --> 24:20.559
THESE TWO IN THE WRONG SPACE?

24:20.559 --> 24:26.031
( BUZZER SOUNDS )
I KEEP BUZZING, AND I'M GETTING

24:26.031 --> 24:27.532
NOWHERE
( BUZZER SOUNDS )

24:27.532 --> 24:32.270
I'M BREAKING DOWN EVERY SINGLE
DIFFERENCE ON ALL THESE COMICS

24:32.270 --> 24:35.974
AND IT'S NOT ADDING UP TO ME
WHAT IS WRONG.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.242
I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HERE.

24:37.242 --> 24:40.178
SO SOMEBODY'S WRONG HERE, AND I
DON'T THINK IT'S ME, BUT IT HAS

24:40.178 --> 24:44.549
TO BE ME.

24:44.549 --> 24:47.352
ORANGE, TOILET PAPER.

24:47.352 --> 24:50.021
( BUZZER SOUNDS )
IT'S OKAY COMP THAT MAKES ME

24:50.021 --> 24:52.757
LOOK GREAT TO MY CLIENTS.

24:52.757 --> 24:57.562
( HORN BLOWS )
>> I KNOW I'M THE TARGET THIS

24:57.562 --> 24:58.697
WEEK.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.765
I HAVE TO WIN THIS GOLDEN POWER
OF VETO AND SAVE MYSELF.

25:00.765 --> 25:02.267
IT IS IMPERATIVE.

25:02.267 --> 25:12.444
IF I DON'T, MY CHANCES OF GOING
HOME ARE PROBABLY VERY HIGH.

25:12.444 --> 25:16.982
I LOVE MY COMIC BOOK!

25:16.982 --> 25:17.949
"TIFFY-TOES."

25:17.949 --> 25:25.991
I HAVE TO KICK SOME BUTT TO STAY
IN THIS HOUSE.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.627
I'M LOOKING AT KYLAND COMIC.

25:28.627 --> 25:30.996
ALL I SEE IS A SCOTTY PIPPIN
IMPRESSION.

25:30.996 --> 25:35.934
BODY IS KIND OF HOT, FACE, NOT.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.335
SARAH BREATH.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.671
SARAH BETH NEVER TALKED TO
ANYBODY EXCEPT KYLAND.

25:39.671 --> 25:49.714
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SARAH BETH'S
BREATH SMELLS LIKE.

25:49.714 --> 25:55.253
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SARAH BETH'S
BREATH SMELLS LIKE.

25:55.253 --> 25:57.555
SO I'M GOING TO TAKE A STAB IN
THE DARK HERE.

25:57.555 --> 26:01.726
I THINK I HAVE EVERYTHING IN THE
RIGHT ORDER, SO LET ME HIT THE

26:01.726 --> 26:02.727
BUZZER.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.730
( BUZZER SOUNDS )
I'M WRONG.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.667
I NEED TO GO BACK UP THIS
LADDER, ZIP BACK DOWN THIS LINE,

26:08.667 --> 26:15.206
SEE WHAT I HAVE WRONG, AND
CORRECT IT ON MY LAPTOP.

26:15.206 --> 26:19.477
( BUZZER SOUNDS )
I KNOW I'M CLOSE.

26:19.477 --> 26:22.147
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING HERE THAT
IS WRONG.

26:22.147 --> 26:29.688
IF I COULD JUST FIGURE IT OUT,
THEN I KNOW I'VE GOT THIS.

26:29.688 --> 26:33.291
THREE, TWO, LET'S GO
( HORN SOUNDS )

26:33.291 --> 26:37.629
>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO WIN
THIS VETO BECAUSE THAT IS THE

26:37.629 --> 26:43.735
ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE MY SAFETY
AND BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO FINAL

26:43.735 --> 26:47.806
FIVE.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.541
ORB AN OCEAN ANAHANNAH.

26:49.541 --> 26:52.077
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE MY COMIC.

26:52.077 --> 26:55.680
IT DOESN'T MAKE THE MOST SENSE
TO ME, JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT

26:55.680 --> 26:56.982
RIPPED IN REAL LIFE.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.650
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

26:58.650 --> 26:59.985
I LOOK STRONG.

26:59.985 --> 27:04.656
I WILL SERVE UP A BOWL OF HOT
CLAM CHADDHA, ANY DAY.

27:04.656 --> 27:05.724
GET IT?

27:05.724 --> 27:06.958
MY LAST NAME IS CHADDHA AND
EVERYONE CALLS ME THAT.

27:06.958 --> 27:12.964
DUH.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.401
CAR, KNEE PADS, SOCKS.

27:16.401 --> 27:21.106
SENTENCE I'M NOT AS FAST AT
RUNNING AS SOME OF THE OTHER

27:21.106 --> 27:24.743
HOUSEGUESTS ARE, I REALLY HAVE
TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF EACH ZIP

27:24.743 --> 27:25.977
LINE TRIP.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.979
WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO GO SLOW ON
THE ZIP LINE BECAUSE I REALLY

27:27.979 --> 27:31.082
HAVE TO ABSORB AS MUCH
INFORMATION AND AS MANY DETAILS

27:31.082 --> 27:35.587
AS POSSIBLE.

REMEMBER HIM?

27:42.927 --> 27:44.095
BECAUSE I DON'T.

27:44.095 --> 27:47.432
FOR TRAVIS' COMIC, IN ONE
VERSION HE HAS A TAIL AND IN THE

27:47.432 --> 27:49.100
OTHER HE DOESN'T.

27:49.100 --> 27:55.840
TRAVIS IS LIKE A HALF-COW,
HOW-SURVGER DUDE-TYPE SUPERHERO,

27:55.840 --> 27:59.177
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE
NEAR THAT SUPERHERO.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.714
THIS IMAGE WILL PROBABLY HAUNT
MY NIGHTMARES FOR THE NEXT, I

28:02.714 --> 28:05.116
DON'T KNOW, COUPLE OF MONTHS
( MOOING )

28:05.116 --> 28:08.053

PAPER.

NO!

NOW I JUST NEED SARAH BETH AND
ALYSSA'S.

28:16.594 --> 28:21.266
LET'S JUST-- LET'S JUST GO WITH
THIS.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.968
( BELL RINGS )
OH, WOW, OKAY.

28:23.968 --> 28:26.905
I GET IT RIGHT ON MY VERY FIRST
TRY.

I'M FEELING VERY PROUD OF
MYSELF.

28:28.339 --> 28:34.245
I FEEL LIKE I WENT AS FAST AS I
COULD HAVE, SO I'M HOPING THAT'S

28:34.245 --> 28:34.712
ENOUGH TO WIN.

28:34.712 --> 28:35.613
THIS WAS AWESOME!

28:35.613 --> 28:37.615
I QOT TO PLAY IN B.B. COMICS!

28:44.989 --> 28:48.560
EVERYONE DID FOR THE B.B. COMICS
VETO COMPETITION.

28:48.560 --> 28:52.730

OF 14 MINUTES AND FIVE SECONDS.

THERE YOU GO, DEREK.

29:06.411 --> 29:07.278
CONGRATULATIONS, DEREK.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.113
THAT MEANS YOU'RE CURRENTLY IN
THE LEAD.

>> I HAVE NEVER HEARD THAT IN MY
LIFE.

>> XAVIER LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN
BEAT DEREK'S TIME OF 14.05.

YOU FINISHED WITH A TIME OF 20
MINUTES AND 56 SECONDS.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.528
( APPLAUSE )
WHICH MEANS, DEREK, YOU'RE STILL

29:23.528 --> 29:24.195
IN THE LEAD.

29:24.195 --> 29:25.430
>> I'M SHOCKED.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.132
BECAUSE I'M NEVER IN THE LEAD.

29:27.132 --> 29:30.301
I'M JUST, LIKE, WAIT, I MIGHT
ACTUALLY WIN THIS GOLDEN POWER

29:30.301 --> 29:31.769
OF VETO.

29:31.769 --> 29:35.106
>> TIFFANY, YOU FINISHED WITH A
TIME OF...

29:35.106 --> 29:36.074
40 MINUTES.

29:36.074 --> 29:39.544
( APPLAUSE )
>> I TIMED OUT, AND IT SUCKS

29:39.544 --> 29:44.149
THAT MY TIME SUCTION, BUT I'M
HOPING MAYBE AZAH PULLS THIS

29:44.149 --> 29:45.350
OUT.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.685
AND IF SHE DOES, HOPEFULLY SHE
WILL USE THE POWER OF VETO TO

29:47.685 --> 29:48.887
SAVE ME FROM THE BLOCK.

29:48.887 --> 29:51.956
AND THEN WE CAN WORK ON GETTING
ONE OF THE GUYS OUT OF THIS

29:51.956 --> 29:53.091
HOUSE INSTEAD.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.894
>> THAT MEANS IT'S DOWN TO
DEREK, AZAH, OR MYSELF FOR THE

29:55.894 --> 29:56.794
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

29:56.794 --> 29:59.764

>> DEREK F.IS CURRENTLY IN THE
LEAD.

30:07.672 --> 30:09.007
LET'S SEE IF I BEAT HIS TIME.

30:09.007 --> 30:12.844
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE BIG "D" GET
A WIN THIS WEEK.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.880
BUT BECAUSE I'M H.O.H., IT IS
TOO IMPORTANT FOR ME NOT TO HAVE

30:15.880 --> 30:19.851
THE POWER IN MY HANDS, SO I AM
HOPING MY SCORE CAN BEAT HIS.

30:19.851 --> 30:22.987
I FINISHED WITH A TIME OF 11
MINUTES AND 44 SECONDS.

30:22.987 --> 30:23.621

GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

>> YAY.

30:32.330 --> 30:32.697
( APPLAUSE ).

30:32.697 --> 30:33.231
>> BOOM.

30:33.231 --> 30:34.098
LOOK AT THIS.

30:34.098 --> 30:35.433
AIN'T SHE SHINY?

30:35.433 --> 30:37.969
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M KEEPING ALL
THE POWER IN MY HANDS THIS WEEK.

30:37.969 --> 30:41.105
THIS ONE FEELS NICE.

30:41.105 --> 30:44.609
>> OF COURSE IT SUCKS THAT I
LOST THIS VETO.

30:44.609 --> 30:47.345
BUT RIGHT NOW I REALLY HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

30:47.345 --> 30:50.081
TO KEEP MYSELF AND HOPEFULLY
TIFFANY IN THIS HOUSE.

30:50.081 --> 30:51.349
>> NICE JOB.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.150
WHAT A HUSTLE.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.785
>> I AM TOTALLY DEFEATED.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.687
I HAVE LOST THIS VETO.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.956
BUT KYLAND WINNING IS NOT THE
WORST CASE.

30:57.956 --> 31:07.999
I MAY BE ABLE TO T TALK HIM INTO
KEEPING ME IN THIS HOUSE.

31:07.999 --> 31:14.005
I MAY BE ABLE TO T TALK HIM INTO
KEEPING ME IN THIS HOUSE.

31:14.005 --> 31:16.808
>> I MEAN, TWICE IN ONE WEEK.

31:16.808 --> 31:20.345
I'M VERY PROUD OF MYSELF FOR
GETTING SECOND PLACE TWO TIMES

31:20.345 --> 31:23.514
IN A ROW, THE VETO COMP AND THE
H.O.H. COMP.

31:23.514 --> 31:26.251
BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO

31:26.251 --> 31:27.919
START SEEING ME AS A THREAT.

31:27.919 --> 31:30.888
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL TAKE A
GROUP PICTURE OF US?

31:30.888 --> 31:32.824
>> YEAH, LET'S STAND IN FRONT OF
THE DOOR.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.926
HEY, A GROUP PICTURE IN FRONT OF
DOOR, OR SOMETHING.

31:34.926 --> 31:38.496
>> I DEFINITELY DON'T NEED TO
BECOME A COMP BEAST AND START

31:38.496 --> 31:41.699
MAKING PEOPLE A LITTLE WORRIED
BECAUSE I NEED TO MAKE SURE

31:41.699 --> 31:44.002
THESE FIVE PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE
ME TO THE END.

31:44.002 --> 31:50.908
>> THIS IS LIKE THE MEETING OF
THE LA-VENGERS.

31:50.908 --> 31:51.909
>> WE SHOULD DO A POSE?

31:51.909 --> 31:54.012
>> SHOULD WE DO A POSE.

31:54.012 --> 31:57.215
>> THE COOKOUT!

31:57.215 --> 31:57.882
>> WOOOO!

31:57.882 --> 32:03.755
>> LA-VENGERS UNITE.

32:03.755 --> 32:07.025
>> OBVIOUSLY, HAVE TO PUT YOU
UP, SEND HOME, AS YOU KNOW.

32:07.025 --> 32:09.027
>> AS I WAS AWARE.

32:09.027 --> 32:12.864
>> NO, WINNING THIS VETO DURING
MY H.O.H. GIVES ME ALL THE POWER

32:12.864 --> 32:13.731
THIS WEEK.

32:13.731 --> 32:15.867
WHICH MEANS THEY CAN CONSIDER MY
OPTIONS.

32:15.867 --> 32:21.272
>> I'M ASSUMING SINCE-- I'M
ASSUMING YOU'RE PLANNING TO KEEP

32:21.272 --> 32:23.808
NOMINATIONING THE SAME, OR--
>> I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

32:23.808 --> 32:25.009
>> OKAY.

32:25.009 --> 32:29.314
>> LIKE NEXT WEEK, I THINK WHO
IS MOST LIKELY TO WIN H.O.H.?

32:29.314 --> 32:30.014
>> ME.

32:30.014 --> 32:31.316
OR CHADDHA.

32:31.316 --> 32:35.687
>> AND SO I'M KIND OF LIKE--
>> PULL CHADDHA DOWN TO TRY TO

32:35.687 --> 32:37.221
GET IN HER GOOD GRACES?

32:37.221 --> 32:39.590
>> THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF
LEANING.

32:39.590 --> 32:42.026
>> AND THEN PUT UP WHO?

32:42.026 --> 32:45.330
>> WHO... WOULD MAKE SENSE IN
YOUR HEAD?

32:45.330 --> 32:47.432
>> PROBABLY AZAH.

32:47.432 --> 32:54.038
BUT THEN, YOU GET BLOOD ON YOUR
HANDS-- WHAT, YOU THINK BIG "D"?

32:54.038 --> 32:55.106
>> I THINK BIG D.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.240
>> OKAY.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.710
>> AS FAR AS REPLACEMENT
NOMINEES, I WOULD CONSIDER USING

32:58.710 --> 33:00.678
DEREK, BECAUSE HE IS LOYAL.

33:00.678 --> 33:04.582
SO I REALLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT HIM RETALIATING AGAINST

33:04.582 --> 33:05.783
ME.

33:05.783 --> 33:08.119
DEREK HAS BEEN A PAWN FOR ME
BEFORE, AND IT DIDN'T DAMAGE OUR

33:08.119 --> 33:08.920
RELATIONSHIP THEN.

33:08.920 --> 33:13.725
I NEED TO ENSURE THAT I'M
PROTECTED.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.961
>> WORST-CASE SCENARIO, TIFFANY
GETS AZAH.

33:16.961 --> 33:20.164
AZAH AND CHADDHA VOTE OUT BIG
"D."

33:20.164 --> 33:22.600
>> THEN IT'S TIFFANY AND
CHADDHA--

33:22.600 --> 33:27.271
>> TIFFANY, CHADDHA, AZAH ALL
AGAINST ME NEXT WEEK.

33:27.271 --> 33:28.873
I CAN BEAT THEM.

33:28.873 --> 33:30.408
BUT IT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASING
OUR CHANCES.

33:30.408 --> 33:31.342
IT WILL BE THREE ON ONE.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.310
>> YES.

33:32.310 --> 33:35.546
>> I PREFER KYLAND LEAVE
NOMINATIONS THE SAME.

33:35.546 --> 33:38.916
I THINK IF HE PUTS UP BIG D.,
THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR BIG

33:38.916 --> 33:43.321
D.TO GO HOME AND THEN HANNAH,
TIFFANY, AND AZAH ALL HAVE

33:43.321 --> 33:45.723
INCENTIVE TO COME AFTER KYLE AND
MYSELF.

33:45.723 --> 33:49.093
IT IS A RISK I DON'T THINK AT
THIS STAGE OF THE GAME WE SHOULD

33:49.093 --> 33:49.761
PLAY OUT.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.096
WE LOSE OUR NUMBERS IF BIG D.

33:52.096 --> 33:52.730
GOES UP.

33:52.730 --> 33:53.464
>> YEAH.

33:53.464 --> 33:54.599
>> THAT IS--
>> THAT IS THE RISK.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.667
>> THAT IS THE RISK WITH THAT.

33:56.667 --> 34:00.037
AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT RISK
OUTWEIGHS--

34:00.037 --> 34:02.607
>> THE RISK OF ONE-ON-ONE NEXT
WEEK WITH CHADDHA.

34:02.607 --> 34:03.841
>> YEAH.

34:03.841 --> 34:08.279
>> I NEED TO CONSIDER ALL OF MY
OPTIONS FOR HOW TO USE OR NOT

34:08.279 --> 34:10.481
USE THE VETO THIS WEEK.

34:10.481 --> 34:14.018
BECAUSE NEXT WEEK IS ARGUABLY MY
MOST VULNERABLE POINT IN THIS

34:14.018 --> 34:15.253
ENTIRE GAME.

34:15.253 --> 34:18.790
I NEED TO MAKE SURE I AM SITTING
IN ONE OF THOSE TWO CHAIRS ON

34:18.790 --> 34:19.991
FINALE NIGHT.

34:19.991 --> 34:22.627
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WANT TO
MAKE SURE THAT YOU AND I ARE

34:22.627 --> 34:23.127
GETTING TO THE END.

34:23.127 --> 34:24.128
>> YUP.

34:41.012 --> 34:44.015
THE VETO, BUT I DIDN'T JUST LO
LOSE.

34:44.015 --> 34:47.919
IT WAS LIKE A W WAKE-UP CALL.

34:47.919 --> 34:48.486
MY EGO WAS IN THE WAY.

34:48.486 --> 34:49.654
MY PRIDE WAS IN THE WAY.

34:49.654 --> 34:56.461
AND WHEN I LOST, THAT WAS GOD,
LIKE, LET ME HUMBLE YOU REAL

34:56.461 --> 34:57.662
QUICK.

34:57.662 --> 35:05.203
I AM TRULY SORRY THAT I GOT US
TO THIS POINT WHERE I HAVE TO

35:05.203 --> 35:09.674
ASK YOU TO TRUST ME AGAIN.

35:09.674 --> 35:13.277
I GENUINELY, SINCERELY
APOLOGIZE, BUT I WILL NEVER DO

35:13.277 --> 35:14.412
IT AGAIN.

35:14.412 --> 35:16.247
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.

35:16.247 --> 35:20.418
>> SO, THIS CONVERSATION IS ME
TOTALLY SETTING MY PRIDE TO THE

35:20.418 --> 35:21.686
SIDE.

35:21.686 --> 35:26.424
I DON'T HAVE A LIFE IN THIS
HOUSE WITHOUT YOU.

35:26.424 --> 35:30.394
MY GAME IS OVER UNLESS YOU SAVE
ME.

35:30.394 --> 35:34.298
IF I AM GOING TO HAVE ANY CHANCE
OF STAYING IN THIS HOUSE, I HAVE

35:34.298 --> 35:35.266
TO TURN KYLAND AROUND.

35:35.266 --> 35:37.869
I HAVE TO GET HIM BACK ON MY
SIDE.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.570
I DEFINITELY WANT TO WIN.

35:39.570 --> 35:40.471
WHO KNOWS?

35:40.471 --> 35:42.740
I CAN GET TO FINAL TWO AND STILL
BEAT HIM.

35:42.740 --> 35:46.310
BUT I CAN'T GET TO FINAL
ANYWHERE IF I GO HOME THIS WEEK.

35:46.310 --> 35:53.885
THE ONLY WAY I CAN STAY IS TO
WORK WITH YOU, AND ONLY YOU.

35:53.885 --> 36:01.158
BUT I ALSO DO BELIEVE THAT
HAVING ME HERE IS STILL

36:01.158 --> 36:02.126
BENEFICIAL FOR YOUR GAME.

36:02.126 --> 36:04.228
>> I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.964
>> I AM NOT COMING AFTER YOU.

36:06.964 --> 36:09.200
YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE MY VOTE.

36:09.200 --> 36:13.137
IF IT'S DOWN TO A VETO AND I WIN
IT, I WILL ALWAYS PULL YOU OFF

36:13.137 --> 36:14.272
THE BLOCK.

36:14.272 --> 36:16.240
IF WE ARE DOWN TO THE FINAL
THREE AND WE ARE DOWN TO THE

36:16.240 --> 36:19.544
FINAL TWO, YOU GO WHEREVER I GO.

36:19.544 --> 36:24.549
I KNOW WORDS ARE JUST WORDS, BUT
IF I AM HERE, I WILL BACK THOSE

36:24.549 --> 36:26.951
WORDS UP WITH ACTIONS.

36:26.951 --> 36:31.556
>> I BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD STAY
LOYAL TO ME IN THIS GAME.

36:31.556 --> 36:35.226
I 100% AM OPEN.

36:35.226 --> 36:38.162
TIFFANY OFFERING ME HER
UNCONDITIONAL LOYALTY FOR THE

36:38.162 --> 36:40.698
REST OF THIS GAME SELL ENTICING.

36:40.698 --> 36:47.138
SHE IS A PRETTY STRONG PLAYER
SOCIALLY, STRATEGICALLY, AND IN

36:47.138 --> 36:48.239
COMPETITION.

36:48.239 --> 36:51.008
HOWEVER, SHE HAS SHOWN ON
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THAT SHE

36:51.008 --> 36:53.477
USUALLY LEANS MORE TOWARDS HER
OWN SELF-INTEREST, WHICH REALLY

36:53.477 --> 36:56.981
GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU'RE
NOT SOMEONE THAT A TEAMMATE OR

36:56.981 --> 36:59.250
PARTNER CAN COUNT ON TO BE LOYAL
WHEN IT REALLY MATTERS.

36:59.250 --> 37:04.422
>> IF YOU KEEP ME IN THIS GAME,
I ALWAYS CHOOSING YOU.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.290
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CHADDHA.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.792
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S AZAH.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.894
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S BIG D.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.562
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S "X."

37:11.562 --> 37:13.364
NONE OF THEM CAN SAVE ME.

37:13.364 --> 37:25.977
ULTIMATELY, IT COMES DOWN TO
YOU.

37:25.977 --> 37:30.982
♪ ♪ ♪
>> OKAY, WELL, HOW ARE YOU?

37:30.982 --> 37:32.850
CONGRATULATIONS ON WINNING THE
VETO

37:32.850 --> 37:35.987
( LAUGHS )
>> SO WHAT I'M LOOKING AT

37:35.987 --> 37:38.422
>> WITH THIS VETO SITUATION IS
NEXT WEEK.

37:38.422 --> 37:39.557

37:39.557 --> 37:43.027

H.O.H., I, OBVIOUSLY, CAN'T

37:43.027 --> 37:43.961
COMPETE.

37:43.961 --> 37:45.763
SO THEN IT'S JUST FIGURING OUT,
OKAY, WHO--

37:45.763 --> 37:47.732
>> WHO HAS INCENTIVE TO KEEP YOU
HERE.

37:47.732 --> 37:48.032
>> EXACTLY.

37:48.032 --> 37:48.399
>> OKAY.

37:48.399 --> 37:49.600
>> YES.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.536
>> I'M GOING TO OFFER KYLAND
WHATEVER I CAN SO THAT HE'LL BE

37:52.536 --> 37:56.073
CONVINCED TO USE THE VETO ON ME,
PULL ME DOWN OFF THE BLOCK, AND

37:56.073 --> 37:58.509
THAT WAY, MAYBE I CAN WORK
SOMETHING UP ON THE TO KEEP

37:58.509 --> 38:02.213
TIFFANY HERE, AND BOTH HER AND I
CAN STAY AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

38:02.213 --> 38:06.083
IF YOU WERE TO USE THE VETO ON
ME, I THINK THAT WOULD PROVE TO

38:06.083 --> 38:09.053
ME THAT YOU WOULD ALSO LIKE TO
WORK WITH ME MOVING FORWARD.

38:09.053 --> 38:12.890
AND WHAT I CAN OFFER IS I WON'T
COME AFTER YOU NEXT WEEK.

38:12.890 --> 38:14.959
IN THE EVENT THAT YOU FIND
YOURSELF ON THE BLOCK, I WILL

38:14.959 --> 38:18.329
USE THE VETO ON YOU, AND TAKE
YOU DOWN, IF I CAN WIN.

38:18.329 --> 38:24.502
IF I AM THE FINAL VETO HOLDER AT
FINAL FOUR, THEN I WILL USE THAT

38:24.502 --> 38:26.871
VETO ON YOU TO BRING YOU TO
FINAL THREE.

38:26.871 --> 38:30.141
>> YEAH, THAT IS-- THAT MAKES A
LOT OF SENSE.

38:30.141 --> 38:35.079
I THINK-- I DON'T WANT YOU TO
TAKE LIGHTLY HOW-- THE

38:35.079 --> 38:36.947
CONSIDERATION THAT I'M PUTTING
INTO THE THINGS YOU'RE SAYING.

38:36.947 --> 38:37.748
>> OKAY.

38:37.748 --> 38:40.184
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO NOT GO
HOME.

38:40.184 --> 38:42.186
>> I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO GO
HOME.

38:42.186 --> 38:44.588
>> WELL, YEAH, I KNOW.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.791
BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO NOT
GO HOME.

38:46.791 --> 38:49.126
>> I UNDERSTAND YOU.

38:49.126 --> 38:51.262
HANNAH HAS PROVEN HERSELF TO BE
A STRONG COMPETITOR.

38:51.262 --> 38:55.232
IF I USE THIS VETE ON ON HER,
THAT COULD STRENGTHEN OUR

38:55.232 --> 38:57.535
RELATIONSHIP GOING INTO THE NEXT
H.O.H. WHERE I WILL NOT BE ABLE

38:57.535 --> 38:58.669
TO PLAY.

38:58.669 --> 38:59.937
BUT THE QUESTION IS, CAN I TRUST
HER TO VOTE TIFFANY OUT?

38:59.937 --> 39:02.573
>> PLEASE DON'T SEND ME HOME.

39:02.573 --> 39:02.773
PLEASE.

39:24.962 --> 39:26.731
>> HEY, HOUSEGUESTS.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.733
IT'S TIME FOR THE VETO MEETING.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.347
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

39:43.347 --> 39:47.118
TIFFANY AND HANNAH HAVE BEEN
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION, BUT I

39:47.118 --> 39:50.855
HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE OF
THE NOMINATIONS.

39:50.855 --> 39:53.290
I HAVE DECIDED...

39:53.290 --> 39:57.428
NOT TO USE THE POWER OF VETO.

39:57.428 --> 40:00.364
I LOVE YOU ALL SO DEEPLY.

40:00.364 --> 40:03.734
I'M SORRY FOR ANY PAIN THIS HAS
CAUSED.

40:03.734 --> 40:14.845
AND I WISH YOU BOTH THE BEST OF
LUCK.

40:14.845 --> 40:24.555
THIS VETO MEETING IS ADJOURNED.

40:24.555 --> 40:28.325
I TAKE NO PLEASURE IN HAVING TO
BE THE FIRST PERSON TO SEND A

40:28.325 --> 40:30.127
MEMBER OF THE COOKOUT HOME.

40:30.127 --> 40:34.431
BUT LOCKING IN THESE NOMINATIONS
HELPS ENSURE THAT MY TARGET,

40:34.431 --> 40:37.635
TIFFANY, IS MORE LIKELY TO GO
HOME THIS WEEK.

40:37.635 --> 40:42.206
AND THAT EVICTION WILL BE THE
BEST STRATEGIC MOVE TO GET

40:42.206 --> 40:46.644
MYSELF AND XAVIER TO THE FINAL
TWO.

40:46.644 --> 40:49.780
>> IT ABSOLUTELY SUCKS THAT I'M
SITTING ON THE BLOCK NEXT TO MY

40:49.780 --> 40:51.415
NUMBER ONE ALLY, TIFFANY.

40:51.415 --> 40:54.718
IT'S A SCARY THOUGHT OF POSSIBLY
HAVING TO PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT

40:54.718 --> 40:55.853
HER.

40:55.853 --> 40:58.489
BUT SHE ONLY NEEDS TWO VOTES TO
STAY THIS WEEK, AND I'M

40:58.489 --> 41:00.224
CERTAINLY NOT UNDERESTIMATING
HER.

41:00.224 --> 41:03.627
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY
GET THOSE TWO VOTES SO THAT I'LL

41:03.627 --> 41:04.795
BE HERE BY THE END OF THIS WEEK.

41:04.795 --> 41:08.833
>> I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR
TIFFANY TO GET OUT OF THIS

41:08.833 --> 41:09.533
HOUSE.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.269
I MIGHT VOTE FOR HER TWO TIMES.

41:12.269 --> 41:18.776
TIFFANY WAS A QUEEN, BUT SHE
FORGOT THAT I'M A JOKER, AND THE

41:18.776 --> 41:24.815
JOKERS ALWAYS GET THE LAST LAUGH
( LAUGHING )

41:24.815 --> 41:28.519
>> I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHY
THESE PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF ME.

41:28.519 --> 41:33.257
I AM THE REASON WHY WE ARE WHERE
WE ARE TODAY, THE SAME WAY I

41:33.257 --> 41:36.093
CAME UP WITH THE MASTER PLAN,
THE SAME WAY I WILL COME UP WITH

41:36.093 --> 41:40.097
ANOTHER PLAN TO MAKE SURE I'M
STILL IN THIS HOUSE NEXT WEEK.

41:40.097 --> 41:41.799
SO, YEAH, THEY'RE SCARED.

41:41.799 --> 41:42.466
AND THEY SHOULD BE.

41:42.466 --> 41:42.900
IT'S "BIG BROTHER."

41:42.900 --> 41:47.271
I CAME TO PLAY.

41:47.271 --> 41:50.841
>> Announcer: WHO WILL BE
EVICTED, TIFFANY OR HANNAH?

41:50.841 --> 41:56.413
AND WHO WILL BE THE SECOND
HOUSEGUEST TO LEAVE AT THE

41:56.413 --> 41:59.950
SURPRISE TWO-HOUR DOUBLE
EVICTION?

41:59.950 --> 42:01.886
FIND OUT TOMORROW NIGHT AT 8:00,
7:00 CENTRAL, ON "BIG BROTHER"!
