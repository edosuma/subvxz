WEBVTT

00:21.938 --> 00:23.440
[Fish] Where are you, Nadine?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.900
[siren wailing in distance]

00:39.372 --> 00:43.376
The witness has a history of running away,
but we're confident we'll locate her.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.919
I just need an adjournment.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.673
I'm sorry, given the public turmoil
this whole situation has stirred up,

00:48.757 --> 00:51.134
I think it's best we proceed as scheduled.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.178
I'd like to read the witness' testimony
into the record--

00:53.261 --> 00:56.431
Your Honor, that is a clear violation
of my clients' Crawford rights.

00:56.514 --> 00:59.976
I'm not about to subvert due process
because the State misplaced its witness.

01:00.643 --> 01:01.895
Find her, Counselor.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.397
Trial will begin as scheduled.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.734
Needless to say,

01:07.817 --> 01:10.153
I'll move to have the case dismissed
as soon as possible.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.280
I think Dolan will grant it.

01:12.363 --> 01:16.159
As long as your witness doesn't show up,
you three are in the clear.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.203
Lucky you.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.039
[Pete] And what about my case?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.667
[Sam] Without aggravated manslaughter,

01:24.751 --> 01:26.461
you're still on the hook
for death by auto.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.755
But the State's case
is all circumstantial.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.092
Trial will come down to a choice
between two narratives,

01:33.176 --> 01:36.387
hero cop versus a prosecutor
playing the race card.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.604
Teresa Tonelli's
on the prosecution's witness list.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.272
Your wife's cousin?

01:48.191 --> 01:49.192
Yeah.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.197
In an ideal world,
she would say nothing...

01:55.323 --> 01:56.616
about the truck...

01:57.200 --> 02:00.620
or whatever transpired between
the two of you when she borrowed it.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.457
That would be ideal.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.212
So, what we need to do...

02:12.465 --> 02:14.050
I need to see Pete alone.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.887
Given the circumstances...

02:18.763 --> 02:20.890
he might become my sole client.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.393
So, we need some privacy.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.900
You're in good hands.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.446
[door closes]

02:37.407 --> 02:41.411
-I want you to know, I got nothing to do--
-You want absolution?

02:42.495 --> 02:43.746
Find a priest.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.832
I don't fucking care.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.377
All I care about is clearing a cop's name

02:49.460 --> 02:51.671
so that people don't grab
for their fucking camera phones

02:51.754 --> 02:53.423
every time they spot a badge.

03:01.931 --> 03:02.849
Hey.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.101
Osorio.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.984
We're in the homestretch, okay?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.029
We gotta keep the kid calm.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.700
He gets nervous, makes a deal,
it all falls apart.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.120
You gotta keep it together, all right?

03:25.121 --> 03:26.372
I already did my part.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.625
-Hey!
-Don't tell me what to do.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.668
Crazy running into you kids here.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.795
Yeah, funny.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.089
My dentist is in this building.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.800
Good guy, great drill work.
If y'all ever need a, uh, root canal,

03:37.884 --> 03:38.801
you let me know, okay?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.762
Let's bounce.
Game's on, gonna miss the tip.

03:40.845 --> 03:44.015
No, hold up, hold up. Um,
I need a little help finding a witness.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.686
Fifteen-year-old kid, junkie,
purple streak in her hair.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.730
I know you know her.
Remember that picture I showed you?

03:50.813 --> 03:53.483
Why don't you get a canine
search and rescue on it?

03:53.566 --> 03:55.401
Wait, what am I talking about?
You got all those dogs,

03:55.485 --> 03:58.696
so, why don't you give them
one of her panties to sniff?

03:58.780 --> 03:59.906
Aah.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.658
Nah, I'll let that one slide, D.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.620
But when I find my witness, if she
tells me you so much as looked at her--

04:05.703 --> 04:07.664
What are you gonna fucking do, Fish?

04:12.335 --> 04:14.087
You lost your witness.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.756
Don't come at me
'cause you're shit police.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.719
Hey, Fish, you like birds?

04:23.388 --> 04:24.389
See you guys later.

04:28.643 --> 04:32.730
Perception will be key,
so I need you to sit together in court.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.525
The jury will notice.
I hope that's not a problem.

04:36.025 --> 04:36.943
It isn't.

04:38.361 --> 04:42.156
Good. As Brenton's mother,
your testimony is so critical.

04:43.032 --> 04:46.661
The jury needs to see your son
through your eyes.

04:46.744 --> 04:50.290
Let them feel your love and your pain.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.793
Half of them have children,
so if you feel emotional,

04:53.876 --> 04:55.295
if you need to cry,

04:55.378 --> 04:57.463
don't be afraid to let them see that.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.759
The defense will come at you hard.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.972
She'll claim Brenton was a gang member,
she'll paint you as a clueless parent.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.224
But I know who my child is.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.519
She'll mention the Port Authority arrest
last summer

05:11.602 --> 05:15.189
since you were the one to pick Brenton up
and pay the DEDR penalty.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.816
And that's why you needed that $500.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.568
-Brenton--
-You said it was for the car.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.111
Brenton begged me not to say anything--

05:20.194 --> 05:22.864
-You should've told me!
-[KJ] Mr. Butler, we need to focus.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.035
We have just one day before trial.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.078
We need to be on the same side.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.830
We can't afford
to let the jury see this...

05:31.331 --> 05:34.375
whatever this is going on
between you two.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.377
You don't have to worry about me.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.213
Okay.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.759
We need to talk about Seth.
I know how much Brenton meant to him,

05:42.842 --> 05:45.344
but his ties to the Five Kings
only hurt us.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.598
So, the best thing that he can do
is stay away.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.372
[knocking on door]

06:17.877 --> 06:19.587
Marcelle's out with the kids.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.005
I came to see you.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.804
About the trial.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.140
The prosecutor
doesn't want you to testify.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.853
What with your Five Kings, your past.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.313
Yeah, I figured as much.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.399
Um...

06:41.859 --> 06:43.986
She also doesn't want you
to be at the trial.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.239
Said it won't look good.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.578
Whatever it takes.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.832
Whatever it takes
to get justice for little man.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.626
-Okay.
-I won't make no trouble.

06:59.043 --> 06:59.961
Good.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.512
Going back already?

07:13.558 --> 07:15.726
Thought all you wanted
was to be home again.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.356
Home ain't here.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.026
Not no more.

[groans]

08:53.407 --> 08:54.367
Fish!

08:57.245 --> 08:59.580
The State's case
against three of my clients

08:59.664 --> 09:02.625
rests entirely
on this witness's testimony.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.044
I move to dismiss the charges
against them.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.712
Counselor, any response to that?

09:07.296 --> 09:11.384
My witness turns up dead
the day before trial.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.011
That doesn't bother anyone?

09:16.097 --> 09:18.224
She was a heroin addict who...

09:18.683 --> 09:21.269
in my understanding, overdosed.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.438
It's a tragedy, but not a crime.

09:24.522 --> 09:29.819
Your Honor, if you dismiss,
without prejudice, please.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.947
In case any further evidence
comes to light.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.702
Preliminary rapid tox
came back positive for heroin.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.038
That plus the needle mark
at the right interior forearm

09:41.122 --> 09:42.915
with the discoloration around it.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.919
Preliminary cause of death
looks like acute heroin toxicity.

09:47.003 --> 09:51.007
Pending final tox results,
I'm gonna call MOD an accident.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.926
You're saying she OD'd?

09:57.388 --> 09:59.265
You're wrong. That's wrong.

10:00.516 --> 10:01.767
-[detective] Rinaldi.
-Huh?

10:01.851 --> 10:02.810
Hey.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.105
The kid's a junkie.
Come on, you said it yourself.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.658
[elevator doors open]

10:18.534 --> 10:20.202
[approaching footsteps]

10:35.217 --> 10:36.177
[Evelyn] No.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.222
No.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.600
[Evelyn sobbing]

10:44.977 --> 10:46.771
But she said she saw them.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.357
She made a statement, didn't she?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.859
-Why can't the jury know that?
-It's not admissible.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.529
A defendant has a constitutional right
to confront an accuser in court.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.282
What about Brenton's rights?

10:58.366 --> 11:02.078
They weren't thinking about his rights
when they left him to die in that ditch.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.496
We lost our son.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.290
We lost everything.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.796
And now you're telling me
he'll only get five years?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.798
Without the conspiracy charges,

11:14.757 --> 11:18.094
auto death carries a sentence
of five to ten years.

11:18.886 --> 11:22.598
But as the defendant is a police officer,
he has certain protections.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.141
Oh.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.019
[breathes heavily]

11:28.312 --> 11:32.942
In similar cases, I've never seen
a sentence of more than five years.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.529
And it is likely
that he will serve less than that.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.155
[breath trembling]

11:38.656 --> 11:40.032
[Latrice exhales heavily]

11:40.366 --> 11:43.536
I will do everything in my power...

11:44.412 --> 11:46.497
to ensure he serves more.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.706
[Latrice groans]

11:51.752 --> 11:54.046
[door opens, slams shut]

11:57.800 --> 11:58.759
[Isaiah scoffs]

12:00.761 --> 12:02.221
I'll do everything I can.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.974
I promise. I...

12:07.435 --> 12:08.394
Yeah.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.273
Everybody promises.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.278
You know, when I was growing up,
I always thought that, uh...

12:18.446 --> 12:19.697
I was different.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.157
And I believed.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.243
And I had faith.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.080
So, you're always thinking
you're protected, you know,

12:28.164 --> 12:29.582
nothing's gonna touch me.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.836
Nothing gonna touch my family.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.466
And then something happens.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.259
And then you realize.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.387
Because it ain't just happening to me.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.599
It ain't just happen to my son.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.561
It's happening to black boys all over.

12:50.644 --> 12:55.274
I'll do everything in my power
to ensure he serves more than that.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.943
He will pay for what he did.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.612
Really?

13:07.244 --> 13:08.162
[Pete]<i> A hate crime?</i>

13:08.829 --> 13:10.122
And what does that mean?

13:10.206 --> 13:14.793
The assistant prosecutor is alleging
that you left Brenton Butler for dead

13:14.877 --> 13:15.961
because of his race.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.881
He didn't know his race,
he didn't even see him.

13:18.964 --> 13:22.801
If she can prove it's a hate crime,
and you're convicted of auto death,

13:22.885 --> 13:25.429
your sentence will be enhanced,
substantially.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.473
And what are we talking?

13:27.556 --> 13:29.183
Auto death is five to ten years.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.771
With this particular enhancement,
you're looking at 20 to 30 years.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.857
Jesus Christ.

13:36.941 --> 13:42.404
She'll go after character, your history,
any sort of racial bias in your past.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.659
Let's get to work.
We don't have a lot of time.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.410
Can you put coffee on?

13:49.245 --> 13:50.538

v. Peter Jablonski.

Is the State ready to give
its opening statements, Ms. Harper?

14:58.606 --> 14:59.607
Yes, Your Honor.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.486
[KJ sighs]

15:07.031 --> 15:09.575
This case is clear and simple.

15:11.243 --> 15:15.122
On the morning of February 15, 2017,

15:16.081 --> 15:18.167
as he drove through Liberty Park,

15:19.126 --> 15:21.128
Officer Peter Jablonski...

15:22.254 --> 15:24.298
hit 15-year-old Brenton Butler...

15:24.924 --> 15:27.176
and fled the scene of his crime.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.387

in the park,

15:38.020 --> 15:40.064
a car which is now mysteriously missing.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.691
After he hit Brenton,

15:43.567 --> 15:47.655
Officer Jablonski did not stop
and render aid,

15:47.738 --> 15:51.033
as was his duty as an officer of the law.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.994
Instead, he made the heartless calculation

15:54.078 --> 15:58.332
that this young black boy's life
mattered less than his own future.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.461
And he left Brenton in that ditch

16:03.212 --> 16:05.965
as a blizzard blanketed this city.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.343
Brenton lay there for 12 hours.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.263
But it took Officer Jablonski
only a moment,

16:13.347 --> 16:15.057
a few seconds maybe,

16:16.183 --> 16:18.352
to deny a boy his life

16:18.811 --> 16:21.814
and ruin the lives
of everyone who loved him.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.777
The reason the State
has characterized this as a hate crime

16:26.860 --> 16:29.571
is that when Officer Jablonski
made that decision,

16:30.030 --> 16:34.576
he acted under the biased belief
that this young black child's life

16:34.660 --> 16:35.995
was disposable.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.916
As we will demonstrate from his record
and his personal history,

16:41.959 --> 16:46.839
Officer Jablonski's prejudices led him
to believe that no one would care enough

16:46.922 --> 16:49.299
to properly investigate Brenton's death.

16:49.383 --> 16:54.013
And no one would be willing
to convict him for killing this child.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.434
You have the power to prove him wrong.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.312
[baby cooing]

17:11.864 --> 17:17.369
The State would like you to believe
its case is simple and straightforward.

17:18.871 --> 17:23.459
If they believe it's simple,
it's because their facts are slight.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.044
If they tell you it's straightforward,

17:25.127 --> 17:28.297
that's because they don't want you
to notice the holes.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.051
They have built a circumstantial case

17:32.134 --> 17:36.138
selectively assembled
to cast guilt on my client,

17:37.097 --> 17:40.059
a young officer with a new family,

17:40.142 --> 17:41.560
a stellar record,

17:41.643 --> 17:43.979
and a profound sense of integrity.

17:44.855 --> 17:48.567
The only reason the State
can tie him to that park at all

17:48.650 --> 17:50.986
is because he was doing his job.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.532
Someone hit Brenton Butler,
and it is a tragedy.

17:57.117 --> 18:01.330
But this was in all likelihood
a gang-related death,

18:01.413 --> 18:03.207
not a hate crime.

18:03.290 --> 18:07.461
The very fact that the State
has brought this charge at all

18:07.544 --> 18:11.548
tells you that this trial
is a politically motivated stunt

18:11.632 --> 18:13.926
designed to placate a city

18:14.009 --> 18:17.221
that has been torn apart
by the death of this young boy.

18:18.347 --> 18:23.102
Yes, race is a painful issue
in this country.

18:23.185 --> 18:28.982
And yes, prejudice and bias
are despicable realities.

18:29.066 --> 18:34.196
But the law is blind to all but the facts,
and so must you be.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.160
[baby coos]

18:44.206 --> 18:45.874
You may proceed, Counselor.

18:47.876 --> 18:51.463
The State would like to call to the stand
Sergeant Michael DiAngelo.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.757
[door opens]

18:57.719 --> 18:58.554
[door closes]

19:03.142 --> 19:05.561
[deputy] Swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

19:05.644 --> 19:07.688
-so help you God?
-I do.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.774
[DiAngelo clears throat]

19:15.445 --> 19:18.157
Can you state your name and rank
for the record?

19:18.240 --> 19:21.451
Michael DiAngelo.
Sergeant, Special Investigations,

19:21.535 --> 19:23.453
Anti-Gang and Drug Unit,

19:23.537 --> 19:25.330
Jersey City Police Department.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.667
And what exactly does your job entail?

19:28.750 --> 19:32.045
I investigate the possession
and distribution of narcotics

19:32.129 --> 19:36.466
and the criminal street gangs
associated with the city's drug trade.

19:36.550 --> 19:40.095
And do you arrest these criminals
or do you just investigate them?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.764
Objection. Your Honor,
she's badgering her own witness.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.391
[Dolan] Ms. Harper, keep to the point.

19:48.020 --> 19:54.610
I'd like to mark this report
dated February 15th, 2017 as Exhibit S-1.

19:54.693 --> 19:59.323
It says you and Officer Wilcox
were executing a controlled buy

19:59.406 --> 20:03.202
at the Riverside Projects
on the morning of February 15th

20:03.285 --> 20:06.205
from approximately
6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.289
Is that correct?

20:07.372 --> 20:09.458
-If that's what I wrote.
-It is.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.881
Officer Jablonski wasn't present?
Or Officer Osorio?

20:15.964 --> 20:17.174
They were both there.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.802
Jablonski wasn't an official member
of my team yet,

20:20.886 --> 20:23.472
and Osorio I left off by mistake.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.015
Hmm.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.563
Can the clerk please mark tower records

20:31.647 --> 20:34.191
from American Telephone and Telegraph,

20:35.234 --> 20:39.738
tower NJ-148NJC as Exhibit S-2.

20:39.821 --> 20:41.698
Sergeant, according to these records,

20:41.782 --> 20:44.451
at the times indicated in your report,

20:44.534 --> 20:47.079
your cell phone made several calls...

20:47.788 --> 20:49.373
from a tower serving Liberty Park,

20:49.456 --> 20:53.335
placing you either within the park
or very close to its boundary.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.255
Well, most arrests don't happen
at an exact address.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.173
They happen in the general vicinity.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.510
Criminals tend to, uh--
They-- They move around.

21:02.135 --> 21:07.975
Your phone placed a six-minute call
to Officer Jablonski's phone at 6:45 a.m.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.936
According to Bayonne Hospital
security footage,

21:11.019 --> 21:15.190
Officer Jablonski didn't arrive
until 7:33 a.m.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.860
Can you account for his whereabouts
during those 42 minutes?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.320
[DiAngelo] Me personally? No.

21:20.529 --> 21:24.157
[KJ] From the location
you were actually at to Bayonne Hospital

21:24.241 --> 21:27.077
is routinely a 15-minute drive
at 7:00 a.m.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.831
-If you say so.
-Google Maps says so.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.628
That leaves 27 minutes
you can't account for.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.090
Twenty-seven minutes
during which Officer Jablonski

21:40.173 --> 21:42.426
could have been driving
through Liberty Park.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.514
-That's possible, I suppose.
-[KJ] It is.

21:47.597 --> 21:51.560
And isn't it also possible
that during that 27 minutes

21:51.643 --> 21:55.480
Officer Jablonski hit Brenton Butler
and drove away?

21:55.564 --> 21:56.398
No.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.526
Petey did not kill that kid.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.279
But you can't know that, Sergeant.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.657
Well, unless you were there
in the park with him.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.492
Can you?

22:16.418 --> 22:20.464
I understand today in court is not
your first encounter with Ms. Harper.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.676
My unit interacts with prosecutors a lot.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.721
I've met Ms. Harper before.

22:27.804 --> 22:32.017
Can you tell me about your interaction
with Ms. Harper on March 8th?

22:34.352 --> 22:38.231
She didn't agree with my tactics
in an investigation.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.984
She, uh...
She called me a "son of a bitch."

22:41.068 --> 22:44.237
-So, clearly, she has an ax to grind.
-Objection! Relevance.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.947
Well, it goes to motivation.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.784
Prosecutor's bias led to these charges.

22:48.867 --> 22:49.993
Sustained.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.746
How the AP does her job
is not on trial here.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.706
Sergeant, in your experience,

22:54.790 --> 22:57.000
is Liberty Park associated
with gangs and drugs?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.001
It is.

22:58.085 --> 23:02.798
In your expert opinion, could a teenager
left for dead in that park

23:02.881 --> 23:06.802
have been the victim of gang retaliation
made to look like a hit-and-run?

23:06.885 --> 23:09.137
I'd say that is definitely possible.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.640
Thank you, Sergeant. No further questions.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.937
[KJ] Officer Osorio,
are you a native Spanish speaker?

23:20.148 --> 23:21.191
Yeah.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.735
And have you ever personally felt
singled out on the job

23:23.819 --> 23:24.736
when you spoke Spanish?

23:25.737 --> 23:29.574
-We don't see color, we see blue.
-[KJ] That's department policy, isn't it?

23:30.075 --> 23:32.828
Not to discriminate
based on race or creed?

23:34.538 --> 23:36.414
Yeah. You know that.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.334
Have any of your co-workers
in the Jersey City Police Department

23:39.417 --> 23:41.002
ever used racial epithets?

23:46.174 --> 23:48.176
-No.
-[KJ scoffs] Really?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.387
Objection.
Your Honor, the State is fishing.

23:50.470 --> 23:53.431
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
a culture of racial attitudes

23:53.515 --> 23:55.392
that may have affected
the defendant's state of mind.

23:55.475 --> 23:59.938
I'll allow it, but get to the point
with the next question, Counselor.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.190
In Officer Jablonski's arrest record,

24:02.274 --> 24:06.194
both while in your unit
and in the East District,

24:07.612 --> 24:11.241
there are disproportionate arrests
of individuals of color.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.952
As a Puerto Rican officer,

24:14.995 --> 24:17.664
are you really telling me
that race doesn't matter?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.504
Not in my experience.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.424
Are you lying to protect
your fellow officer?

24:27.507 --> 24:28.758
Objection! Your Honor.

24:28.842 --> 24:31.136
Apologies, Your Honor.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.598
That's all I have.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.811
[KJ] Can you state your name, please?

24:40.604 --> 24:42.397
Peter Matthew Jablonski.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.775
[KJ] And what is your relationship
to the defendant?

24:45.859 --> 24:46.860
I'm his father.

24:47.444 --> 24:50.780
I understand you
and Mr. Jablonski's mother separated

24:50.864 --> 24:52.157
when he was a child.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.285
Were you involved at all
in his upbringing?

24:55.368 --> 24:57.078
Well, just because she and I
called it quits

24:57.162 --> 24:58.955
doesn't mean I was gonna leave him
in the lurch.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.624
I had him weekends, some weekends,

25:00.707 --> 25:04.753
and, you know, I tried to teach him stuff
that I learned the hard way,

25:04.836 --> 25:06.046
so he didn't have to.

25:06.546 --> 25:11.218
[KJ] Were you with him during the incident
that occurred on July 30th, 2004?

25:13.261 --> 25:14.512
Yeah, I was there.

25:16.806 --> 25:21.686
I'd like to mark Exhibits S-4A and S-4B
at this time.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.521
Proceed.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.197
[indistinct murmuring]

25:46.044 --> 25:47.963
-Can you tell us what happened?
-Sure.

25:48.046 --> 25:48.880
[inhales]

25:48.964 --> 25:51.800
Petey was kind of a runt in high school,
and this...

25:52.676 --> 25:54.803
corner kid was always picking on him.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.014
Ah, one time Pete saved up
for some Jordans,

25:58.098 --> 26:01.726
and sure enough,
that little thug jumped him. Stole them.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.104
Now I don't know about you,
but no son of mine's

26:04.187 --> 26:08.358
gonna leave a beating unanswered,
so I showed him a couple of moves,

26:08.441 --> 26:11.069
and then I marched him
right on down back there.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.113
Petey destroyed that kid. [chuckles]

26:14.948 --> 26:16.116
Taught that animal a lesson.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.619
And do you think this incident
might have left your son

26:19.703 --> 26:21.663
with any reason for racial animus?

26:22.998 --> 26:23.873
Oh.

26:25.208 --> 26:28.545
Yeah, okay. You're black, I'm white,
bottom line. I got eyes.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.755
You know, the trouble comes when--

26:30.839 --> 26:33.300
when we pretend like people
aren't who they are.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.387
[low murmurs]

26:37.470 --> 26:39.097
No further questions, Your Honor.

26:52.527 --> 26:57.198
Isn't it true you haven't spoken
to your son since he was 18?

26:57.824 --> 27:00.577
That is until February 23rd,

27:00.660 --> 27:03.121
when he continued to insist
on no contact.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.206
That sounds like his mother talking.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.208
Would it have anything to do
with the abuse

27:07.292 --> 27:09.210
he and his mother suffered at your hands?

27:15.050 --> 27:18.970
Your Honor, I'd like to mark
this Jersey City Hospital report

27:19.387 --> 27:23.558
from August 28th, 1995 Exhibit D-1.

27:35.278 --> 27:36.404
Broken arm.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.908
Dislocated shoulder.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.786
Two broken ribs,

27:42.869 --> 27:47.791
extensive bruising on arms,
back, neck, and face.

27:47.874 --> 27:50.752
How old was your son
when you did this to him?

27:51.961 --> 27:54.422
I don't remember exactly.
This was an accident.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.676
He was six, Mr. Jablonski.

27:59.427 --> 28:01.179
Your son was six years old.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.514
[indistinct murmuring]

28:15.402 --> 28:16.403
You okay?

28:19.489 --> 28:21.199
Osorio looked like shit up there.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.868
You talk to him lately?

28:23.952 --> 28:26.955
Ah, I figure we'll give him some space.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.125
He'll talk when he's ready. All right?

28:30.208 --> 28:31.501
-All right.
-Okay.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.837
-Ms. Harper, can we get a statement?
-Ms. Harper!

28:33.920 --> 28:37.966
Is Officer's Jablonski's alleged crime
part of a larger culture at the JCPD?

28:38.550 --> 28:43.054
[KJ] One can't help but wonder why
an officer of the law like Mr. Jablonski

28:43.138 --> 28:45.807
chose to leave a young black child
to die in a ditch.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.016
You fucked up.

28:48.017 --> 28:50.103
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Fish.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.647
Medical examiner said she shot up.
She didn't use needles.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.524
Okay.

28:55.358 --> 28:57.569
A heroin junkie who's health conscious,
that's nice.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.029
-Hey!
-[Fish] You fucked up, motherfucker!

29:00.280 --> 29:01.114
Yeah, you did!

29:02.657 --> 29:04.492
I fucking got you, you piece of shit!

29:04.576 --> 29:06.411
Got nothing, motherfucker.
You got nothing!

29:07.454 --> 29:09.706
Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.460
-Ms. Harper, what do you think of that?
-[overlapping questions]

29:26.264 --> 29:27.223
Oh, hey.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.392
Welcome...

29:30.894 --> 29:32.103
to my home.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.062
[sniffs]

29:36.191 --> 29:37.942
Uh, I talked to Connelly.

29:38.026 --> 29:38.860
[Fish] Hmm.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.155
He's gonna make sure
you only get yelled at.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.740
A little.

29:50.872 --> 29:51.790
I'm sorry.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.291
Do not apologize.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.335
He deserved it.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.175
God.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.594
[sniffles, sighs]

30:12.519 --> 30:13.812
We can still get them.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.189
If I can flip Jablonski, then...

30:31.913 --> 30:34.624
[protestors, group 1] Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

30:34.707 --> 30:38.795
[protestors, group 2] Support our cops!
Support our cops!

30:38.878 --> 30:40.880
[indistinct chatter]

30:44.843 --> 30:47.053
They subpoenaed me.
Said I had to be here.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.264
Whatever you say up there, don't hurt us.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.015
Are you asking me to lie?

30:52.433 --> 30:54.018
Better take care of your girl.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.145
[indistinct chatter]

31:07.615 --> 31:08.533
You got it?

31:09.409 --> 31:10.451
Come on.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.872
Look at this guy, huh?

31:14.706 --> 31:16.332
What's going on with this hat?

31:16.416 --> 31:17.876
What's going on with the hat?

31:17.959 --> 31:20.461
Know what I mean?
What's this? What is this?

31:20.545 --> 31:21.379
[DiAngelo chuckles]

31:22.672 --> 31:24.132
Tell me about the seagulls.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.427
Brenton loved them.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.638
I don't know how it started,

31:30.763 --> 31:34.017
but they were everywhere. On...

31:34.934 --> 31:37.145
napkins, notebooks,

31:37.687 --> 31:40.690
the wall in his bedroom.

31:40.773 --> 31:45.570
And he would make
these little papier-mâché ones too.

31:45.653 --> 31:48.281
He gave those to the people he loved.

31:48.364 --> 31:53.494
And you found one of those papier-mâché
seagulls in Brenton's hospital room

31:53.578 --> 31:54.913
after the accident?

31:55.455 --> 31:57.415
Yes, on his bed.

31:58.791 --> 32:00.418
Someone had put it there.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.255
That man.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.052
How do you know that?

32:09.135 --> 32:11.554
Because I saw him the night before
in Brenton's room.

32:12.013 --> 32:15.683
I went to pray with my husband
and our church.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.436
And when I came back, he was there,

32:19.395 --> 32:20.688
standing over Brenton.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.900
He asked me if...

32:25.777 --> 32:27.195
if he was gonna live.

32:30.365 --> 32:34.661
And then he claimed
he was in the wrong room and ran out.

32:36.579 --> 32:39.040
I'd like to present these photos,

32:39.123 --> 32:41.834
previously marked as Exhibits S-5A

32:42.377 --> 32:43.252
and S-5B.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.888
This is the seagull from Brenton's bike.

33:03.773 --> 33:06.567
Is that the seagull that you recovered
from Brenton's room

33:06.651 --> 33:08.444
after your encounter with the defendant?

33:09.487 --> 33:11.030
Yes, it is.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.533
Mrs. Butler, why do you think

33:13.616 --> 33:17.829
that Officer Jablonski would remove
evidence from the crime scene,

33:18.538 --> 33:21.040
and then leave it
in the hospital room of the victim?

33:21.124 --> 33:23.084
Because he felt guilty.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.462
He knew what he did to my son.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.257
He knew--

33:29.340 --> 33:30.341
[breath quavering]

33:31.676 --> 33:32.844
He knew.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.429
[KJ] Thank you.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.639
No further questions.

33:43.896 --> 33:44.772
[baby coos]

33:54.449 --> 33:59.871
Mrs. Butler, please let me convey
my deepest sympathy for your loss.

33:59.954 --> 34:02.290
I know this must be very hard for you.

34:03.499 --> 34:05.793
It's never hard to talk about my son.

34:05.877 --> 34:10.631
And I understand you must have
wanted answers after this tragedy.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.883
Who did this?

34:11.966 --> 34:15.011
Why was Brenton in that park
that morning?

34:15.094 --> 34:18.139
Objection!
Is there a question for the witness?

34:18.639 --> 34:19.766
[Sam] I'll rephrase.

34:19.849 --> 34:22.143
You were searching for answers,
Mrs. Butler.

34:23.019 --> 34:24.937
Is that why you followed my client?

34:25.021 --> 34:27.148
Why you waited outside of his house?

34:28.316 --> 34:29.984
I knew he knew something.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.278
How many times did you go to his house?

34:35.448 --> 34:39.118
-I don't remember exactly.
-More than twice?

34:39.702 --> 34:42.246
-Three, four times maybe?
-Maybe.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.665
Does that include the time
you accosted him

34:44.749 --> 34:46.501
at the Greenplace Market in Bayonne?

34:46.584 --> 34:48.169
He was avoiding me.

34:50.379 --> 34:53.800
This is what I'm struggling to understand,
Mrs. Butler.

34:54.217 --> 34:58.930
My client could have brought that seagull
out of sympathy, no?

34:59.764 --> 35:02.433
Why did you assume
it meant he killed your son?

35:02.892 --> 35:03.893
I didn't at first.

35:03.976 --> 35:06.395
Is it possible you had answers,

35:06.938 --> 35:10.066
Mrs. Butler, just not the ones you wanted?

35:12.902 --> 35:16.781
-I don't understand the question.
-Let me give you a concrete example.

35:18.074 --> 35:22.662
Why did you pick up Brenton
at Port Authority on August 4th, 2016?

35:22.745 --> 35:24.831
-Objection!
-Overruled.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.833
The issue has already been decided.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.710
Answer the question.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.299
He had been arrested.

35:35.675 --> 35:36.592
Right.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.054
In the company of Kadeuce Porter,

35:40.930 --> 35:43.641
for criminal possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.393
It was two joints.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.145
I worked at St. Peter's school.

35:47.228 --> 35:50.773
Half those kids had ten times that amount
in their locker.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.233
How many of them have been arrested

35:52.316 --> 35:54.861
with a known member
of the largest street gang in Jersey--

35:54.944 --> 35:56.445
Brenton wasn't in a gang.

35:56.529 --> 35:59.031
-How can you be so sure?
-Because I'm his mother.

36:00.074 --> 36:04.287
Isn't it possible he might have kept
his gang affiliation from you

36:04.370 --> 36:06.414
precisely because you're his mother?

36:06.497 --> 36:07.498
No!

36:08.666 --> 36:10.084
I know my son.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.420
I would've known.

36:12.503 --> 36:16.507
Do you know why he was in Liberty Park
that morning?

36:25.099 --> 36:26.017
No.

36:37.653 --> 36:39.947
Are you still employed
at St. Peter's Prep?

36:41.824 --> 36:43.034
Not currently.

36:43.993 --> 36:46.537
I understand it's been hard
since Brenton's death.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.915
You and your husband both lost your jobs.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.168
You have a mortgage on a new house.

36:53.002 --> 36:53.836
What--

36:54.128 --> 36:56.547
What does this have to do with Brenton?

36:56.631 --> 36:58.925
Have you ever met Jay Sterling?

36:59.300 --> 37:00.343
[Latrice] Yes.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.803
[Sam]
Jay's an accomplished civil litigator.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.932
He has a lot of experience
with wrongful death suits

37:06.015 --> 37:07.475
against municipalities.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.935
Is that why you sought him?

37:09.018 --> 37:14.023
No, he-- he-- he said that he could help
get justice for Brenton.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.609
You mean with a civil suit.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.612
-No.
-That's how it works, right?

37:21.030 --> 37:22.823
You get a criminal conviction

37:22.907 --> 37:26.160
and the city almost guarantees you
a generous offer.

37:26.244 --> 37:30.081
It wasn't about the money,
it was about making him tell the truth.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.165
Of course.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.584
But the money would help.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.007
No further questions, Your Honor.

37:48.599 --> 37:49.767
[Latrice] I failed him.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.188
I failed Brenton.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.899
You showed them who Brenton was.

37:57.316 --> 38:00.861
-And the jury won't forget that.
-No. The money.

38:01.153 --> 38:03.322
That's all they'll remember is the money.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.326
It's like they killed Brenton
all over again.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.622
I need to testify.

38:14.166 --> 38:17.712
Mr. Butler, she's gonna try
and do the exact same thing to you,

38:17.795 --> 38:19.880
-and if you waver at all--
-I won't.

38:23.843 --> 38:24.760
I won't.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.893
[KJ] Why did you move, Mr. Butler?

38:32.977 --> 38:35.062
[Isaiah] Grew up all my life
in those projects.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.772
I promised myself one thing:

38:37.315 --> 38:40.693
when I had a family, I was gonna get them
out of there as soon as I could.

38:42.862 --> 38:44.739
[KJ] So you saved up for this house?

38:45.656 --> 38:48.075
Took me near on ten years. But yes, I did.

38:50.953 --> 38:54.540
And I don't need any settlement
from the city to pay my mortgage.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.500
I pay my own bills, always have.

39:00.463 --> 39:04.425
And was part of the reason you moved
to get Brenton out of the projects?

39:04.508 --> 39:05.468
Yes.

39:07.136 --> 39:08.888
When a boy reaches a certain age,

39:10.306 --> 39:13.184
the world has a way of asserting itself.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.561
I don't want that for Brenton.

39:16.312 --> 39:18.522
He wasn't built for that.
He was different.

39:18.606 --> 39:22.026
Mr. Butler, did you see any evidence

39:22.109 --> 39:26.072
that Brenton was involved in gang activity
of any kind?

39:26.614 --> 39:29.325
No. He was not in a gang.

39:29.742 --> 39:32.370
And that bike he was on,
the one the Kings ride?

39:33.579 --> 39:34.663
It wasn't his.

39:37.792 --> 39:41.128
You mean the bike Brenton was riding
when he was hit?

39:42.046 --> 39:43.005
Yeah.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.507
A friend loaned it to him.

39:47.968 --> 39:51.472
And what makes you so certain
that your son wasn't in the Five Kings?

39:51.555 --> 39:54.392
When you're a King, you gotta front,

39:55.643 --> 39:56.727
act hard,

39:57.770 --> 39:59.897
be ready to throw down at any time.

40:02.441 --> 40:03.692
My son wasn't hard.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.530
He was kind and good.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.448
Sweet.

40:11.283 --> 40:13.536
Still wore the clothes
his mama bought for him.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.920
No further questions, Your Honor.

40:28.676 --> 40:31.137
Whose bike was it, Mr. Butler?

40:31.220 --> 40:33.472
It was his friend, Kadeuce Porter.

40:33.556 --> 40:36.934
The same Kadeuce Porter
that Brenton was arrested with?

40:37.810 --> 40:38.769
Yes.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.939
[Sam] Isn't it possible, or even likely,

40:42.022 --> 40:43.983
that Kadeuce loaned Brenton that bike,

40:44.066 --> 40:46.527
that expensive, high-status bike,

40:46.610 --> 40:49.613
because Brenton was, in fact,
a member of the Five Kings?

40:49.697 --> 40:52.241
No, I asked Kadeuce.
He said the bike was his.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.827
You believe a known gang member?

40:54.910 --> 40:57.746
I believe a boy I've known
since he was a child.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.791
[Sam] Do you have any family members
who were involved with the Kings?

41:06.046 --> 41:07.882
Your youngest brother, Seth.

41:08.966 --> 41:10.301
He was a known member.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.178
Isn't that true?

41:12.261 --> 41:13.471
Seth got out,

41:14.430 --> 41:16.849
enlisted in the Air Force,
served his country.

41:16.932 --> 41:19.143
He never would've involved Brenton
in any of that.

41:19.226 --> 41:22.104
[Sam] Still, with so many
gang members in his life,

41:22.188 --> 41:26.150
you must've been afraid
that he'd get caught up in that world.

41:27.359 --> 41:30.404
Can you tell me about an incident
involving Social Services

41:30.488 --> 41:32.573
from September 2016?

41:38.329 --> 41:44.543
Apparently, Brenton went to class
with a mark across his calves.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.587
[Isaiah] I, um...

41:46.670 --> 41:48.422
I had disciplined him with a belt.

41:50.591 --> 41:52.218
He hadn't come home that night.

41:53.677 --> 41:56.430
And I used the belt just that one time,
never again.

41:59.308 --> 42:01.435
My son was an upstanding young man.

42:03.437 --> 42:06.524
And yet, the teacher called
Social Services.

42:07.107 --> 42:10.444
-She was that alarmed by the bruising.
-Objection, hearsay.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.364
Your Honor, I'd like to submit
these records

42:13.447 --> 42:15.282
from Child Protective Services

42:15.366 --> 42:19.119
dated September 5th, 2016,

42:19.203 --> 42:21.121
Exhibit D-2.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.294
[baby coos]

42:31.048 --> 42:34.385
[Sam] Mr. Butler, you were scared,

42:35.261 --> 42:38.138
because you didn't know
where Brenton had been that night.

42:39.014 --> 42:40.182
Is that correct?

42:41.934 --> 42:42.768
Yes.

42:43.811 --> 42:48.732
And you don't know if Kadeuce
had recruited him into the Kings.

42:48.816 --> 42:50.192
He didn't belong--

42:50.276 --> 42:54.071
And you don't know
why he was in Liberty Park that morning.

42:54.154 --> 42:55.406
I do know why.

42:57.908 --> 43:00.244
He was cutting through the park
to go to school.

43:00.327 --> 43:01.620
"Cutting through"?

43:01.704 --> 43:05.165
That park is halfway across the city
from his home, his school.

43:05.249 --> 43:08.502
Why would he bike there to get to school?

43:10.671 --> 43:12.006
No further questions.

43:12.631 --> 43:14.466
[softly] He was with another boy.

43:14.550 --> 43:15.801
Speak up, Mr. Butler.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.768
[voice breaking] He was with another boy.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.318
He spent that night with him.

43:36.405 --> 43:39.241
And then Brenton went on to school
that morning after.

43:43.537 --> 43:44.663
And that boy...

43:47.666 --> 43:49.126
he was my son's...

43:52.796 --> 43:53.839
friend.

43:56.634 --> 43:57.635
[exhales]

44:00.971 --> 44:04.099
I'd like to move that last statement
be stricken from the record.

44:04.183 --> 44:06.477
-[KJ] Your Honor, on what grounds?
-[Sam] Hearsay.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.063
The witness will say anything
to protect his son.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.731
She can't just assume that he's lying!

44:10.814 --> 44:12.149
Sustained.

44:12.232 --> 44:14.401
Counselor, tone.

44:18.864 --> 44:21.784
That portion of the testimony
will be stricken from the record and--

44:21.867 --> 44:23.035
Your Honor.

44:24.328 --> 44:25.579
I know who the boyfriend is.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.374
I'd like to add him as a witness,

44:28.457 --> 44:31.251
and I request that he be allowed
to testify in camera

44:31.335 --> 44:33.045
to protect his identity.

44:35.839 --> 44:37.091
[indistinct murmuring]

44:44.181 --> 44:45.224
[Dolan] Thank you, Officers.

44:46.934 --> 44:49.395
Young man, please have a seat over here.

44:57.694 --> 45:00.030
I want a lawyer. I know my rights.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.366
You don't need a lawyer.
You're being called as a witness.

45:02.449 --> 45:03.409
About what?

45:03.992 --> 45:06.787
And this court can compel you to testify.

45:07.579 --> 45:11.291
Testimony was given today about
your relationship with Brenton Butler.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.960
Look, Brenton wasn't no King.

45:13.043 --> 45:14.420
-So can I go now?
-[Dolan] No.

45:14.920 --> 45:16.422
That's not what we're asking.

45:17.172 --> 45:19.299
-[Kadeuce sighs]
-Counselor, your witness.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.052
[KJ] Uh...

45:22.678 --> 45:25.431
-Kadeuce, I know this is hard.
-You do?

45:26.348 --> 45:28.475
You know how it look,
cops pulling up on the corner,

45:28.559 --> 45:29.852
bringing me in here?

45:30.436 --> 45:31.979
Your testimony will be sealed.

45:33.689 --> 45:38.652
What we need to know is the nature
of your relationship with Brenton.

45:38.735 --> 45:39.945
My relationship?

45:44.032 --> 45:49.788
What was the exact nature
of your relationship with Brenton Butler?

45:51.206 --> 45:52.875
I don't know what you talking about.

45:52.958 --> 45:55.961
I know this is difficult,
but please, if you can tell us--

45:56.044 --> 45:59.673
-Objection. He's already given his answer.
-Who the fuck is she?

45:59.756 --> 46:02.342
You will watch your language
in my presence, young man.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.845
Your Honor, this is a delicate matter.

46:05.471 --> 46:07.598
Some leeway, please.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.516
Overruled.

46:10.517 --> 46:11.685
For the moment.

46:11.768 --> 46:13.270
Mr. Butler claims...

46:13.937 --> 46:17.107
you told him that you know
where Brenton was

46:17.191 --> 46:18.692
the night before the accident.

46:20.444 --> 46:21.528
Can you tell us?

46:22.029 --> 46:25.157
And also, who he was with, if anyone?

46:45.928 --> 46:46.845
Brenton...

46:51.016 --> 46:52.017
he and me...

46:57.856 --> 46:59.233
were together that night.

47:07.699 --> 47:11.662
I ain't never had no home
where I felt like I belonged.

47:14.915 --> 47:16.750
Like I wasn't a burden on folks.

47:21.463 --> 47:23.131
I was a burden on everybody.

47:27.678 --> 47:28.929
But not to Brenton.

47:35.477 --> 47:36.603
Not to him.

47:36.687 --> 47:37.729
[soft sobbing]

47:48.323 --> 47:49.157
[door slams shut]

47:49.241 --> 47:52.035
Mr. Butler's testimony
will remain in the record

47:52.119 --> 47:53.537
and the court will provide the jury

47:53.620 --> 47:57.165
with transcripts of supporting testimony
given in camera,

47:57.249 --> 47:59.376
which will otherwise remain sealed.

48:00.252 --> 48:02.129
We've accomplished enough for one day.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.381
Court is adjourned until 10:00 a.m.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.259
This way.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.517
[indistinct chatter]

48:21.565 --> 48:23.734
[speaking indistinctly]

48:25.068 --> 48:27.904
You had a good day today. Congratulations.

48:29.072 --> 48:31.575
You should celebrate, have a drink.

48:50.469 --> 48:51.386
Thank you.

48:54.556 --> 48:56.683
-I did it for Brenton.
-I know.

48:57.768 --> 49:01.188
But if you ever need a place to lie low,
come see me, you understand?

49:02.856 --> 49:04.900
I got a lot more room these days.

49:05.734 --> 49:07.861
I been surviving this place my whole life.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.781
I ain't need nothing from you then,

49:11.031 --> 49:12.658
and I don't need it now.

49:27.756 --> 49:28.799
What you looking at?

49:30.217 --> 49:31.510
Go back to work.

49:38.058 --> 49:41.728
[soldier] I do so solemnly swear
that I will support and defend...

49:41.812 --> 49:45.023
[all] I do solemnly swear
that I will support and defend...

49:45.107 --> 49:47.150
[soldier] The Constitution
of the United States...

49:47.234 --> 49:49.277
[all] The Constitution
of the United States...

49:49.361 --> 49:52.322
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

49:52.406 --> 49:55.283
[all] Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

49:55.367 --> 49:57.911
[soldier] Congratulations.
You made a great decision.

49:57.994 --> 49:58.954
[applause]

50:01.748 --> 50:02.874
[indistinct chatter]

50:18.056 --> 50:21.017
Marcelle told me
that you wouldn't even let her come,

50:21.101 --> 50:26.273
and I said there's no way I was gonna
let you ship off without saying bye.

50:26.356 --> 50:28.817
No, I already put y'all through it once,
so...

50:29.651 --> 50:31.194
Figured you didn't need a repeat of that.

50:31.903 --> 50:33.780
Are you sure about this?

50:35.949 --> 50:37.534
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

50:40.954 --> 50:42.289
Come home.

50:43.290 --> 50:47.127
Least over there,
I know who the enemy's supposed to be.

50:47.210 --> 50:49.880
That gun that I got from Vontrell
to kill Jablonski?

50:49.963 --> 50:51.923
It was greenlit by another cop.

50:52.424 --> 50:53.675
His higher-up.

50:54.217 --> 50:55.093
Di...

50:55.719 --> 50:56.678
DiAngelo.

50:59.055 --> 51:02.851
These motherfuckers are making bank
off our people's blood.

51:04.728 --> 51:06.521
I should have never put that on you.

51:10.317 --> 51:12.194
-I gotta go.
-Please, Seth.

51:12.277 --> 51:14.154
-I...
-Stay.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.989
-Tricey.
-Stay for me.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.867
Stay for your brother. Please.

51:20.577 --> 51:21.661
I gotta go.

51:32.798 --> 51:33.965
Bye, Trice.

51:34.883 --> 51:36.092
Bye, Tricey.

51:44.309 --> 51:45.185
[Marie] Petey.

51:45.852 --> 51:47.187
-Petey.
-[Pete] Mmm.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.106
There's someone out back.

51:51.942 --> 51:53.068
[breathing heavily]

51:53.151 --> 51:54.361
[cocks gun]

51:54.986 --> 51:56.321
[Marie breathing heavily]

51:58.949 --> 52:00.325
[dog barking in distance]

52:14.130 --> 52:14.965
Fuck.

52:22.973 --> 52:23.974
Can't sleep.

52:27.686 --> 52:28.854
You too, huh?

52:30.355 --> 52:31.815
No, what are you doing here?

52:32.691 --> 52:34.317
[exhales shakily]

52:36.278 --> 52:38.989
Worst part about this shit
is you can't talk to nobody.

52:41.032 --> 52:42.158
Who'd understand?

52:44.619 --> 52:48.039
Please, Petey, tell me.
You gotta tell me the truth.

52:48.123 --> 52:51.376
Did you see that kid
before you killed him? Hmm?

52:53.920 --> 52:55.005
You ever hear him...

52:57.799 --> 52:58.633
in your head?

53:06.683 --> 53:07.851
It was an accident.

53:10.270 --> 53:11.605
And whatever you did...

53:12.272 --> 53:13.356
was not the same.

53:14.441 --> 53:15.984
No, not even close.

53:38.840 --> 53:40.008
How do you sleep?

53:43.887 --> 53:44.846
I can't.

53:46.890 --> 53:47.974
I can't sleep.

53:54.773 --> 53:55.607
[sniffs]

54:18.630 --> 54:19.464
[gasps]

54:21.716 --> 54:23.385
What are you doing in my house?

54:25.178 --> 54:26.179
Get out.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.348
I ain't gonna hurt you.

54:28.890 --> 54:32.936
This shit's gonna end, T.
Where you gonna be at? Hmm?

54:33.687 --> 54:34.729
Think about it.

54:35.230 --> 54:38.358
Your cousin, me, all gone.

54:38.441 --> 54:41.695
If you get on that stand
and testify against family--

54:41.778 --> 54:43.154
He's not my family.

54:44.781 --> 54:45.740
Okay.

54:47.826 --> 54:49.160
What about your kid?

55:02.132 --> 55:03.591
Is the baby mine?

55:15.687 --> 55:17.939
You Catholics and your rhythm method,
huh?

55:18.023 --> 55:19.441
Stay away from me.

55:19.524 --> 55:22.235
Come on, T, I ain't gonna hurt
the mother of my child.

55:26.740 --> 55:27.657
Come on.

55:29.951 --> 55:31.119
[Teresa sighs]

55:34.831 --> 55:36.791
How could he leave him out there to die?

55:38.752 --> 55:39.753
He didn't.

55:42.255 --> 55:43.715
He thought the kid was dead.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.511
Petey's a good guy, okay?

55:48.595 --> 55:51.765
You and me, we got our differences
with him, but he's family.

55:52.515 --> 55:54.559
And you gotta accept family.

55:56.686 --> 56:00.065
Severe hypothermia,
cardiac arrhythmia, massive blood loss.

56:00.148 --> 56:02.358
And a concave fracture to his skull.

56:02.442 --> 56:05.528
I immediately moved Mr. Butler
to an operating room

56:05.612 --> 56:08.323
to more safely assess the injuries
to his head.

56:08.865 --> 56:11.034
[KJ] How severe were Brenton's injuries?

56:11.117 --> 56:12.202
[doctor] Severe.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.121
I had to cut away his jacket and hood.

56:16.331 --> 56:19.626
The hood itself was tightly cinched,
and therefore...

56:20.502 --> 56:22.253
keeping parts of his skull intact,

56:22.337 --> 56:25.465
I had to be careful
not to displace the fragments.

56:25.548 --> 56:26.466
[KJ] Why is that?

56:27.634 --> 56:30.929
If I had just removed the hood,
skull shards would've dug into the brain

56:31.012 --> 56:32.430
and caused further damage.

56:32.514 --> 56:36.434
[KJ] Despite all this,
you testified before the grand jury

56:36.518 --> 56:39.729
that Brenton could've lived
had he been found earlier.

56:39.813 --> 56:44.234
Yes, but ultimately the damage
due to blood loss was too great.

56:44.901 --> 56:46.319
It caused organ failure,

56:46.402 --> 56:49.864
necrotizing tissue,
and further brain damage.

56:50.323 --> 56:52.075
His body just gave out.

56:52.158 --> 56:53.660
[low murmurs in crowd]

56:57.372 --> 56:58.873
No more questions, Your Honor.

57:03.294 --> 57:05.296
[Dolan] Does the defense wish to cross?

57:05.922 --> 57:07.173
No, Your Honor.

57:10.051 --> 57:13.930
Brenton's injuries were consistent
with impact from an SUV

57:14.013 --> 57:16.850
weighing approximately 4,100 pounds,

57:16.933 --> 57:19.310
traveling at no less
than 60 miles per hour.

57:19.394 --> 57:24.399
Does the 2014 Ford Escape
registered to Marie Jablonski,

57:24.482 --> 57:26.776
Officer Peter Jablonski's wife,

57:26.860 --> 57:28.611
match the vehicle that hit Brenton?

57:28.695 --> 57:29.529
Yes.

57:30.196 --> 57:32.407
And is the match, and make, and model

57:32.490 --> 57:35.994
the only thing that links
the Jablonski's car to the accident?

57:36.077 --> 57:38.621
[man] No, we recovered paint chips
from the victim's hair.

57:38.705 --> 57:41.249
We conducted a type match analysis

57:41.332 --> 57:45.753
and confirmed it was OF4D92, Yale Blue.

57:45.837 --> 57:48.673
What color was the defendant's car,
according to purchase records?

57:48.756 --> 57:51.718
OF4D92, Yale Blue.

57:51.801 --> 57:54.637
[Sam] Your Honor, objection.
This is all speculation.

57:54.721 --> 57:58.016
[Dolan] I'll allow Ms. Harper
to continue her line of questioning.

57:58.099 --> 58:02.228
Now, an SUV driver sits high
above the undercarriage.

58:02.729 --> 58:05.982
Is it possible
Officer Jablonski hit Brenton

58:06.065 --> 58:07.859
without realizing
that he was a human being?

58:07.942 --> 58:11.738
[man] Brenton was moving perpendicular
to the defendant's direction of motion.

58:11.821 --> 58:15.909
And on a bike, the driver should have had
a clear profile of the victim.

58:17.494 --> 58:18.786
If I were Brenton,

58:19.829 --> 58:24.000
the driver would've seen me
cross his field of vision, like this,

58:24.083 --> 58:26.002
as he hit me with his car.

58:26.085 --> 58:28.129
-Is that a fair assessment?
-It is.

58:29.172 --> 58:33.384
So Officer Jablonski
had every reason to stop after impact

58:33.468 --> 58:37.430
and no reason to doubt
that he hit a young black boy.

58:37.514 --> 58:38.598
None whatsoever.

58:39.307 --> 58:42.060
-No further questions, Your Honor.
-[baby coos]

58:49.901 --> 58:54.697
Is it unusual such a small amount of paint
was recovered from Brenton's body

58:54.781 --> 58:56.950
-and none was found on the bike?
-Not really.

58:57.033 --> 59:00.411
Since Brenton was washed in the ER,
we were lucky to recover anything.

59:00.495 --> 59:02.914
As for the bike, you might expect
to see more paint,

59:02.997 --> 59:05.083
but that depends
on where the car made impact.

59:05.166 --> 59:09.963
Hmm. But absent finding the car
that hit Brenton,

59:10.046 --> 59:13.007
you can't definitively link any vehicle
to Brenton's death?

59:13.091 --> 59:16.928
No, not definitively.
However, the paint is a match

59:17.011 --> 59:19.681
for the factory job
on the defendant's car.

59:19.764 --> 59:22.058
That's as good a match as you'll get.

59:22.141 --> 59:22.976
Mmm.

59:24.185 --> 59:28.147
Your Honor, I'm trying to understand
this moment of impact.

59:28.231 --> 59:32.819
I'd like to use Exhibit S-8
for demonstrative purposes.

59:32.902 --> 59:33.778
I'll allow it.

59:33.861 --> 59:36.406
[Sam] You said that Brenton
crossed perpendicular

59:36.489 --> 59:38.116
to the driver's line of sight.

59:38.783 --> 59:41.077
Are you confident in that assessment?

59:41.160 --> 59:42.287
Yes, I am.

59:44.163 --> 59:45.331
So...

59:46.249 --> 59:50.003
imagining that you're the driver,

59:50.837 --> 59:53.798
this is approximately what you would see
through the windshield?

59:53.881 --> 59:55.133
That's correct.

1:00:06.519 --> 1:00:09.188
[Sam] If you recall, the surgeon testified

1:00:09.272 --> 1:00:13.443
that Brenton's hood was cinched
tightly around his face.

1:00:13.943 --> 1:00:15.361
She had to cut it off.

1:00:17.739 --> 1:00:19.991
Can you tell the race of the rider now?

1:00:20.074 --> 1:00:22.076
I can't see his face.

1:00:23.077 --> 1:00:25.580
[low murmurs]

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:31.586
I'd like the members of the jury
to imagine that they are the driver.

1:00:35.882 --> 1:00:37.717
Can you see this person's face?

1:00:38.551 --> 1:00:43.222
And remember, your line of vision
is not obstructed by a windshield,

1:00:43.306 --> 1:00:44.891
or the falling snow,

1:00:44.974 --> 1:00:46.976
and you're not going 60 miles an hour.

1:00:49.896 --> 1:00:51.189
[low murmurs continue]

1:01:01.574 --> 1:01:04.869
How can an accident be a hate crime...

1:01:05.828 --> 1:01:08.456
if you can't tell the race of the victim?

1:01:09.332 --> 1:01:12.460
My client did not hit this young man,

1:01:12.543 --> 1:01:16.756
but regardless, whoever did
did not commit a hate crime.

1:01:21.135 --> 1:01:23.096
No further questions, Your Honor.

1:01:29.769 --> 1:01:31.062
Ms. Harper. Redirect?

1:01:36.150 --> 1:01:37.694
Given this witness's testimony,

1:01:37.777 --> 1:01:41.114
I move to vacate the hate crime charges
against my client.

1:01:41.197 --> 1:01:43.241
[overlapping angry shouts]

1:01:43.324 --> 1:01:44.909
[scattered applause]

1:01:45.993 --> 1:01:47.370
[Dolan] Order in the court!

1:01:48.955 --> 1:01:50.707
[pounding gavel] Order!
