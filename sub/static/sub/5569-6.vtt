00:02.536 --> 00:04.136
<i>Previously on</i> scream queens...
(gasps, screams)

00:04.138 --> 00:05.971
Chanel:
<i>Once again, death came</i>
<i>to kappa house.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140
(people screaming)

00:08.142 --> 00:09.975
I want everything chanel has,

00:09.977 --> 00:11.276
And that
includes you.

00:11.278 --> 00:13.545
If we're ever gonna find out
what happened to that baby,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.114
<i>We have to figure out</i>
<i>who that woman was.</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:16.982
Gigi:
That got way out of hand.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.217
He's got to go.

00:20.955 --> 00:22.955
Chanel:
<i>I think I figured out</i>
<i>what my problem is.</i>

00:22.957 --> 00:24.690
<i>I'm way too nice.</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.795
<i>As soon as</i>
<i>chanel #2's parents learned</i>

00:29.797 --> 00:31.363
<i>That their daughter's</i>
<i>dead body had been found,</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.165
<i>They went on a cruise</i>
<i>to celebrate.</i>

00:33.167 --> 00:34.967
<i>That's how much</i>
<i>they hated this dead bitch.</i>

00:34.969 --> 00:36.802
<i>So when it fell to me</i>

00:36.804 --> 00:38.370
<i>To host an open casket funeral</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:40.139
<i>And fulfill her dying wish</i>
<i>of being cremated</i>

00:40.141 --> 00:43.742
<i>And shot into space,</i>
<i>I was like, "yeah, okay."</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:45.010
<i>So stupid.</i>

00:45.012 --> 00:47.980
This is what happens
to sneaky backstabbers.

00:47.982 --> 00:49.615
(kisses)

00:51.986 --> 00:55.254
Chanel #3:
<i>Just so you know,</i>
<i>I took all your clothes.</i>

00:55.256 --> 00:57.990
Chanel #5:
<i>It's too bad you had to die...</i>

00:57.992 --> 01:00.125
<i>Before we found out</i>
<i>what ethnicity you are.</i>

01:04.899 --> 01:06.899
Chad:
<i>Godspeed, chanel #2.</i>

01:06.901 --> 01:09.301
<i>God, I loved</i>
<i>porking you so much.</i>

01:13.074 --> 01:14.907
Chanel:
Dearly beloved,

01:14.909 --> 01:17.109
We're gathered here today
because a backstabbing

01:17.111 --> 01:19.278
Little bitch got exactly
what was coming to her.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.748
Chanel #2 literally
never had my back.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.249
Whenever I wanted
to strut across campus

01:24.251 --> 01:25.918
Or down a long hallway
with the other chanels,

01:25.920 --> 01:28.520
She'd always be like,
"I have a colonic!"

01:28.522 --> 01:31.256
So instead
of strutting across campus

01:31.258 --> 01:33.525
In a beautiful
diamond formation,

01:33.527 --> 01:36.895
We were forced to strut across
campus in a triad formation,

01:36.897 --> 01:40.065
Like a bunch of hobos,
because number two

01:40.067 --> 01:42.734
Didn't think she should
have to walk behind me.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.069
But whenever I find myself

01:44.071 --> 01:46.105
Descending
a staircase in heels,

01:46.107 --> 01:47.806
You can bet number two
was right there behind me

01:47.808 --> 01:49.541
With a helpful little nudge.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.244
(screams)

01:52.246 --> 01:53.912
Oops, sorry, chanel.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.081
This dumb dead whore also

01:56.083 --> 01:57.983
Used her high-ponied wiles
to seduce my man

01:57.985 --> 02:00.419
Into rubbing uglies with her.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.721
So I hope you all
grasp the concept

02:02.723 --> 02:04.323
That this is what happens when
you rub uglies with my man--

02:04.325 --> 02:05.958
You end up dead!

02:05.960 --> 02:08.227
So, have fun being dead,
number two.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.962
You were a stupid,
little trollop,

02:09.964 --> 02:11.096
And I hope you're
burning in hell right now.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.098
Amen.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.167
Amen!

02:16.937 --> 02:19.605
Now, I'd like to invite
you all out to the driveway

02:19.607 --> 02:21.940
To the mobile crematorium
for some light refreshments,

02:21.942 --> 02:25.110
Courtesy of our friends
at spaceburial.Today.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.880
Thank you.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.494
Chanel,
are you in here?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.163
Chanel:
Go away!

02:44.165 --> 02:46.165
We just wanted to make
sure you're okay.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.433
We think it be good for you
to open up and talk things out.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.035
Chanel:
There's nothing left
to talk about.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.436
Number two's soul
is rotting in hell

02:51.438 --> 02:53.372
And her remains
have been cremated

02:53.374 --> 02:54.940
And are on their way
to cape canaveral!
I just can't stop

02:54.942 --> 02:56.975
Thinking about number two
and chad having sex.

02:56.977 --> 02:57.976
Hester:
I just find it

02:57.978 --> 02:59.645
So shocking that chanel #2

02:59.647 --> 03:01.046
Would betray
you like that.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.214
Chanel:
Do you?

03:02.216 --> 03:04.616
Do you find it<i> so</i> shocking?

03:04.618 --> 03:06.118
Because you also tried
to sleep with chad, number six.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.820
And you tried to frame me
for murder!

03:08.822 --> 03:11.557
I mean, I went to jail
because of you!
I'm so sorry, chanel.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.192
I promise to never betray
your trust again.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.394
You most certainly won't
betray my trust ever again,

03:15.396 --> 03:19.131
Because you will never
have my trust ever again!

03:19.133 --> 03:21.366
Look, we think you need
to contact number two,

03:21.368 --> 03:23.969
And just give her a chance
to do right by you.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.404
What the hell are
you talking about?! How?!

03:25.406 --> 03:28.173
Well, I found
this old talking board

03:28.175 --> 03:30.008
In the basement.
Those things don't work!

03:30.010 --> 03:31.843
Yes, they do.
Didn't you see the movie?

03:31.845 --> 03:34.012
The movie<i> ouija?</i>
No! No one did!

03:34.014 --> 03:36.048
Tonight we're having
a chanel night, where we heal

03:36.050 --> 03:39.051
All wounds among the chanels,
both living and dead.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.886
We'll order in some duck sauce
for our cotton balls

03:40.888 --> 03:42.921
And contact chanel #2 so she can
prove to you that she's sorry.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.389
What do you say?

03:46.060 --> 03:47.693
Chanel:
This board looks evil.

03:47.695 --> 03:51.163
What are you talking about--
it has two dancing demons,

03:51.165 --> 03:52.931
A dead old lady
and cute little pentagrams.

03:52.933 --> 03:56.168
Okay, so how is this
supposed to work?

03:56.170 --> 03:58.503
We all put our hands
on this thing

03:58.505 --> 04:00.505
Called a planchette
and promise not to move it.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.108
Chanel #2's spirit will move it
after we contact her.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.177
What if chanel #2
is busy getting eiffel-towered

04:05.179 --> 04:06.912
By hitler and satan?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.814
Let's just try it, okay?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.952
Chanel #2...

04:13.954 --> 04:15.387
It's chanels

04:15.389 --> 04:17.122
#1, #3, #5

04:17.124 --> 04:19.091
And #6 contacting you

04:19.093 --> 04:21.960
From beyond the grave...

04:21.962 --> 04:24.196
Are you there,
chanel number #2...?

04:24.198 --> 04:25.998
Are you there...?

04:27.735 --> 04:30.269
Oh, my god, it's working!

04:30.271 --> 04:31.737
We have to ask her a question

04:31.739 --> 04:33.071
Only she would know
the answer to.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.072
Got it.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.707
Chanel #2,

04:35.709 --> 04:37.909
Does chanel #5's vagina
have teeth?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.244
(gasps)
you can't ask her that!

04:39.246 --> 04:41.113
(gasping)

04:41.115 --> 04:42.147
It's her.

04:42.149 --> 04:42.948
Also?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.483
I love this thing.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.951
Okay, what should we
ask her next?

04:48.322 --> 04:50.455
Are you moving it?
No, are you?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.324
No, are<i> you?</i>
I'm not moving it.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.826
Uh, what's it spelling?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.963
C...

04:57.965 --> 04:59.731
H...

04:59.733 --> 05:01.066
A...

05:03.137 --> 05:04.403
D.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.804
(gasps)
chad.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.639
Chad?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.007
I...

05:09.009 --> 05:11.143
S...

05:11.145 --> 05:13.011
Is.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.513
Chad is...

05:19.820 --> 05:22.154
Cheating...

05:22.156 --> 05:23.755
On-on you.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.191
No, that-that can't be true.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.260
He promised he'd
be monogamous.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.631
It's...

05:32.633 --> 05:34.333
True.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.001
It's not true!

05:36.003 --> 05:38.103
Chad promised!

05:38.105 --> 05:40.205
Chanel #2 is screwing with me
from beyond the grave!

05:40.207 --> 05:42.274
Well, everyone in this room,
sit up and take notice.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.676
I am going to prove
that bitch wrong!

05:44.678 --> 05:46.044
(groans loudly)

05:50.384 --> 05:52.951
(phone ringing)

05:55.389 --> 05:56.988
Hello?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.724
Who's this?

05:58.726 --> 06:02.027
No, I'm sorry, I don't
know anyone by that name.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.696
Yeah, I used to know
and love someone by that name,

06:04.698 --> 06:07.065
But I've forced myself
to forget that they exist,

06:07.067 --> 06:10.135
Because they
continuously let me down.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.337
Yes, I am talking about you!
What is wrong with you?!

06:12.339 --> 06:13.972
I told you to get rid of him!

06:16.076 --> 06:18.210
We are not kidnappers.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.979
We are murderers,
hell bent on revenge.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.848
I told you this.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.916
That is our brand,
and if he's messing with it,

06:24.918 --> 06:27.219
He has to go!
No.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.222
I do not want to hear about
how this is hard for you, okay?

06:30.224 --> 06:32.157
You know what's hard for me?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.659
Trying to cook coq au vin

06:34.661 --> 06:37.095
While managing this whole
years-in-the-making revenge plan

06:37.097 --> 06:39.064
Without anyone's help!

06:39.066 --> 06:41.933
And since you guys
are so clearly inefficient

06:41.935 --> 06:43.935
At killing everyone,
I now have to come up

06:43.937 --> 06:45.604
With an overly elaborate plan

06:45.606 --> 06:48.240
To get the scent off of us, too.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.241
Honey, I'm home!

06:49.243 --> 06:50.609
(door closes)

06:50.611 --> 06:52.611
I have to go.

06:52.613 --> 06:56.815
Now, will you please
go kill some people?

06:58.952 --> 07:01.920
Hello, best boyfriend ever.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.021
Hi.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.624
Oh...

07:05.626 --> 07:08.760
Who was that on the phone?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.028
Oh, no one.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.130
Just some family drama.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.965
Oh.
Shall we eat?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.234
Gigi:
I feel ridiculous.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.303
Well, just come out
so I can see.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.139
(gasps)

07:21.141 --> 07:22.474
First of all,

07:22.476 --> 07:24.576
The waist on these jeans
is way too low.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.579
And I feel like the jacket
needs a fun pattern,

07:27.581 --> 07:30.615
Like something the fresh prince
of bel air would wear?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.150
Okay, look,
my dad is a mega-dork

07:32.152 --> 07:33.919
And he's super into you,
but I know him,

07:33.921 --> 07:35.587
And trust me,
he's gonna start

07:35.589 --> 07:37.122
Getting bummed about
your clothes eventually.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.224
Okay, I'm not totally sure

07:39.226 --> 07:41.293
You understand
how fashion works.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.129
In, like, five years,
my clothes

07:44.131 --> 07:46.198
Are gonna be super hip again.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.934
Probably right,

07:48.936 --> 07:50.836
But if you really like my dad,
you should be taking advice

07:50.838 --> 07:53.171
From the girl who knows him
better than anyone in the world.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.339
Hmm?

07:54.341 --> 07:55.874
It's pretty, huh?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.510
Is he still mad at me?

07:58.512 --> 07:59.911
You know, for not
leaving campus?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.346
Mad? No.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.414
No, no, no.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.683
Worried? Yeah.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.585
Is that what today is about?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.353
Are you trying to get
some dad intel from me?

08:08.355 --> 08:09.788
Kind of.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.957
Aw, I get it, hon.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.092
And I'm very touched.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.094
Not in my,
not in my head.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.662
Touched in my heart.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.098
Look, I really
like your dad.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.500
Like his playlists.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.870
I like the borderline-creepy way
he looks out for you.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.671
I like that
he hasn't dated anyone

08:26.673 --> 08:29.040
In, like, 18 years
and somehow makes it not seem

08:29.042 --> 08:30.509
Really, super weird.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.677
He's kind of the perfect guy.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.614
And that guy deserves a girl who
doesn't dress like brenda walsh.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.682
(chuckles)

08:40.721 --> 08:44.055
Oh, who wears a white t-shirt?

08:44.057 --> 08:47.058
Everybody-- like, literally
everybody wears white t-shirts.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.561
Well, thanks
for being cool with me.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.631
I know this hasn't been
easy on you.

08:52.633 --> 08:56.401
Well, you know, I just like
seeing my dad happy, so...

08:56.403 --> 08:58.236
Hey, that reminds me,

08:58.238 --> 09:01.673
I know you and, uh, pete

09:01.675 --> 09:04.309
Have been doing
some investigative reporting

09:04.311 --> 09:06.144
For the school paper.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.479
Yeah.

09:07.481 --> 09:10.015
Have you guys looked
into feather mccarthy?

09:10.017 --> 09:12.751
Yeah, she was a sister
at kappa a couple of years ago

09:12.753 --> 09:14.920
And ended up
leaving the house.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.155
But I remember there
being a lot of drama

09:17.157 --> 09:19.524
Surrounding her
at the central office.

09:19.526 --> 09:23.662
Pretty sure
dean munsch was involved.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.930
Do you think this
girl could have

09:24.932 --> 09:26.097
A vendetta against
kappa house?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.866
Oh, I would be
more interested

09:27.868 --> 09:30.168
To know her thoughts
about dean munsch.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.371
Hey!

09:33.373 --> 09:35.574
You know what would look
great with this top?

09:35.576 --> 09:39.144
Like, a neon leather jacket
with huge shoulder pads!

09:42.883 --> 09:45.083
Woman:
<i>It's really weird.</i>

09:45.085 --> 09:46.952
I haven't been
inside here in a while.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.453
Feather,
we wanted to ask you

09:48.455 --> 09:49.688
Some questions
about dean munsch.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.022
She did it.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.525
Whatever it is,
she was involved somehow.

09:53.527 --> 09:54.926
That woman is friggin' nuts.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.028
I made the mistake
of crossing her,

09:57.030 --> 09:58.263
And it got dark.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.098
What happened?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.400
Well, it was two years ago

10:02.402 --> 10:04.302
That I met her husband,
dr. Munsch,

10:04.304 --> 10:07.772
And we sort of became involved.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.542
He was my beatles 101 professor.

Well, normally I don't
perform for my students.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.989
But... Feather,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.658
You are such

10:59.660 --> 11:01.860
A strong woman.

11:01.862 --> 11:05.830
I love the way you challenge me
in the classroom.

11:10.771 --> 11:14.939
Feather:<i> I mean, he wasn't</i>
<i>really attractive at all,</i>

11:14.941 --> 11:18.510
<i>But I mean,</i>
<i>he was the beatles professor.</i>

11:22.482 --> 11:25.050
<i>So we started having sex.</i>

11:25.052 --> 11:27.652
Not all the time.

11:27.654 --> 11:30.021
He was in his mid-50s,
so he could only get it up,

11:30.023 --> 11:32.057
Like, once or twice a week.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.364
<i>When he broke the news</i>
<i>to dean munsch,</i>

11:39.366 --> 11:41.399
<i>She went crazy.</i>

11:41.401 --> 11:44.035
Cathy, I want a divorce.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.538
Feather and I are in love.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.750
Feather:<i> I knew then that she</i>
<i>was going to come after me.</i>

11:58.752 --> 12:00.585
She kicked dr. Munsch
out of the house,

12:00.587 --> 12:02.921
And he had to move
in to kappa house.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.596
Pink. Tell us something
you learned this week

12:11.598 --> 12:12.997
About what it means
to be a woman.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.232
Oh, yes.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.500
(laughter)
oh, yes.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.434
Um...

12:16.436 --> 12:18.503
(groaning)

12:22.209 --> 12:23.341
(screaming)

12:25.679 --> 12:27.679
Feather:<i> Everywhere I'd go,</i>
<i>she'd just be there,</i>

12:27.681 --> 12:29.948
<i>Dressed exactly like me.</i>

12:32.719 --> 12:34.519
(screaming)

12:34.521 --> 12:36.121
Dean munsch pulled some strings,

12:36.123 --> 12:38.056
And got me kicked
out of kappa house.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.458
I couldn't show my face
on campus,

12:40.460 --> 12:42.727
So I've been finishing up
my education online.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.929
After the divorce went through,

12:44.931 --> 12:46.698
Steven got his house back,

12:46.700 --> 12:48.933
And he asked me
to move in with him.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.435
But listen to this.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.036
A week later,

12:52.038 --> 12:54.105
I was home alone
with period cramps,

12:54.107 --> 12:56.074
So I decided
to take a bubble bath.

12:56.076 --> 12:59.444
<i>Steven had this old ipod thing</i>

12:59.446 --> 13:02.814
<i>That you plug in, and it</i>
<i>picks up music from the air.</i>

13:04.417 --> 13:06.484
(buzzing, screaming)

13:08.488 --> 13:10.121
A transistor radio.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.923
That's how the old dean died.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.159
A transistor fell
in her bathtub.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.293
Feather.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.628
Are you saying that you believe

13:16.630 --> 13:18.730
Dean munsch is capable
of murder?

13:18.732 --> 13:19.597
Yes.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.299
(sighs)

13:21.301 --> 13:23.401
We're now working on a
story about how dean munsch

13:23.403 --> 13:26.237
Is behind all the
murders on campus.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.406
Are you willing to go
on record as a source?

13:29.609 --> 13:31.042
You bet I am.

to have a frank conversation.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.962
Chad?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.563
Chanel, this is not
what it looks like!

15:32.565 --> 15:35.600
Are you having sex
with a goat?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.936
We had a promise, chad.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.270
You looked me in the eye

15:39.272 --> 15:41.039
And promised me
you would try to be monogamous!

15:41.041 --> 15:43.574
Uh, yeah, huh-doi, chanel,
I have been monogamous.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.776
Yes, I've looked

15:44.778 --> 15:46.277
At a ton of porn, yes,

15:46.279 --> 15:47.912
I've been rubbing one out
every five to ten minutes.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.714
But, no, chanel,
I have not cheated on you.

15:49.716 --> 15:50.915
Liar! Chanel #2

15:50.917 --> 15:51.916
Told me from beyond the grave

15:51.918 --> 15:53.651
That you were cheating,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.653
And then I catch you in bed
with a farm animal!

15:55.655 --> 15:56.788
Hey, she is not
a "farm animal."

15:56.790 --> 15:58.089
Her name is rammy,

15:58.091 --> 16:00.058
And she is
a non-human helper companion!

16:00.060 --> 16:01.559
What?

16:01.561 --> 16:02.660
I am leaving.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.228
I am breaking up with you.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.463
Good-bye, chad.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.132
Chanel!

16:08.134 --> 16:09.267
You are gonna close that door,

16:09.269 --> 16:10.401
And you're gonna hear me out.

And that secret shame is that...

16:33.593 --> 16:35.860
(sighs)

16:35.862 --> 16:36.928
(rammy bleating)

16:36.930 --> 16:39.163
...I'm lactose intolerant.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.665
This is insane.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.033
No, it's not insane, chanel.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.935
Lactose intolerance afflicts

16:43.937 --> 16:46.270
Around 50%
of the human population,

16:46.272 --> 16:49.040
Who spend their entire lives
walking past baskin robbins

16:49.042 --> 16:52.110
Knowing that if they even have
a little bit of ice cream,

16:52.112 --> 16:53.778
They're gonna fart a bunch.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.146
And if you weren't
so ignorant,

16:55.148 --> 16:56.781
And you cracked a book
every once in a while,

16:56.783 --> 16:58.816
You would know that goat's milk,

16:58.818 --> 17:00.351
It's lactose free.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.854
And if I gently rub rammy's
belly for eight to ten minutes,

17:02.856 --> 17:04.188
She will relax enough

17:04.190 --> 17:06.457
To allow milking that
could yield up to two liters

17:06.459 --> 17:08.026
Of nutritious,
lactose free protein

17:08.028 --> 17:10.962
That keeps this bod
looking hot, chanel.

17:10.964 --> 17:14.499
Oh, chad, I'm so sorry!

17:14.501 --> 17:16.334
I mean, that makes
so much sense.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.002
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.704
I promise I'll never let
dead number two's messages

17:19.706 --> 17:20.972
Get between us again.

17:20.974 --> 17:22.140
She's clearly trying

17:22.142 --> 17:24.042
To break us up
from beyond the grave!

17:24.044 --> 17:26.077
Look, you just can't
let dead people get to you.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.979
Okay, they're super
pissed off they're dead,

17:27.981 --> 17:29.047
So they're coming
from a place of anger.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.248
I know.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.150
Look, if it makes you feel
any better

17:32.152 --> 17:33.918
We can totally bang
if you want.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.554
That would be so nice.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.922
Oh, um,

17:37.924 --> 17:39.357
I got to milk rammy first.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.992
(bleating)

17:40.994 --> 17:42.226
She's super relaxed right now,

17:42.228 --> 17:44.162
And that udder is,
like, bursting.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.833
(laughs) I mean,

17:48.835 --> 17:51.335
I knew I had had one
hurricane too many,

17:51.337 --> 17:53.037
But let's be honest,

17:53.039 --> 17:55.006
One hurricane is one
hurricane too many.

17:55.008 --> 17:57.675
But so drunk that you
fall down the stairs

17:57.677 --> 17:58.943
In your own apartment?

17:58.945 --> 18:00.344
Wow.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.913
I've been to your apartment.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.182
Uh, you don't have any stairs.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.352
Well, that shows you

18:08.354 --> 18:09.754
How drunk I was.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.089
I hallucinated

18:11.091 --> 18:12.990
A flight of stairs.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.762
Um, this-this is awkward
because, you know,

18:17.764 --> 18:19.430
We're kind of friends.
Oh, no, no, no.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.966
When my mouth has been
where it's been on your body,

18:21.968 --> 18:23.301
I think we can safely say

18:23.303 --> 18:25.803
We are more
than kind of friends.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.772
Yeah, of course.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.974
The thing is, you see,

18:29.976 --> 18:33.111
We've been investigating
these murders on campus,

18:33.113 --> 18:34.312
And it's been really hard

18:34.314 --> 18:36.080
For us to connect them

18:36.082 --> 18:38.116
Because we haven't been able
to find a real motive.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.917
Oh, well, keep your chin up.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.220
I'm sure you'll figure
something out. Ow.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.721
Right.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.590
Uh, the thing is,
I kind of think we have.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.125
Hmm.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.493
Look, this is super awkward,

18:48.495 --> 18:49.927
But someone killed
and dismembered

18:49.929 --> 18:50.995
Your ex-husband last night,

18:50.997 --> 18:52.697
And they put his head
in a fish tank.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.000
Please tell me they killed
that bitch, feather, too.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.102
No. She's fine,
but me and the guys

18:58.104 --> 19:00.938
Down at the station,
we're pretty sure you did it.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.807
I'm sorry?

19:02.809 --> 19:03.774
I mean, you have motive,

19:03.776 --> 19:05.109
No one actually saw you

19:05.111 --> 19:06.677
At the white stallion
last night,

19:06.679 --> 19:07.945
And you have all of the markings

19:07.947 --> 19:09.247
Of someone who's been
in a fight.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.915
And since the murder
was so brutal,

19:10.917 --> 19:12.984
It kind of makes sense
that you might be

19:12.986 --> 19:14.619
Behind all the recent killings.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.854
(chuckles)
so, like,

19:16.856 --> 19:18.956
I'm sorry,
but you're under arrest.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.992
Okay.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.094
Come on.

19:23.096 --> 19:25.263
Now, I'm not playing.
Seriously, you're under arrest.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.464
Yeah, I know. (chuckles)

19:26.466 --> 19:27.698
Come on over.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.799
I'm serious. Stand up.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.668
Come make me.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.004
No, stand up.
You're under arrest! Backup!

19:33.006 --> 19:34.505
Backup! (laughs)

19:36.442 --> 19:37.275
What?!

19:37.277 --> 19:39.043
Oh, come on!

19:39.879 --> 19:40.678
Get her, boys.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.180
Come on, seriously?

19:42.182 --> 19:43.614
Are you sure

19:43.616 --> 19:45.383
This is really necessary?

19:45.385 --> 19:47.385
If you really are
the red devil killer,

19:47.387 --> 19:48.853
Then you're exceptionally nuts.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.888
This is for our safety.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.026
(siren wailing)

20:22.088 --> 20:24.655
(grace sighs)

20:24.657 --> 20:25.990
I mean, look at this.
She is the only suspect

20:25.992 --> 20:28.259
Who could have been
at every murder site.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.061
The only one
that gets tricky is the one

20:30.063 --> 20:32.029
In the house when my dad
and gigi got attacked.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.431
Yeah, but according
to the dickie dollar scholars,

20:33.433 --> 20:34.899
There were two red devils,

20:34.901 --> 20:37.034
So it could have easily
been her henchman.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.270
Look, she was involved
in the cover-up 20 years ago,

20:39.272 --> 20:42.206
She has openly stated
her hatred for kappa,

20:42.208 --> 20:44.275
So motive is clearly
not an issue.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.110
And there's been
no new killings

20:46.112 --> 20:47.878
Since they arrested her.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.848
Look, if we use your amazing
chart as art for the story,

20:50.850 --> 20:54.118
I feel very comfortable
with this headline.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.620
I was going to write,

20:55.622 --> 20:57.221
"hottest girl in school
figures out who the killer is,"

20:57.223 --> 20:59.056
But it was too long.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.324
(laughs)

21:02.061 --> 21:03.961
(sighs)

21:03.963 --> 21:05.930
I mean,
I can't believe we did it.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.932
I can't believe
this is really over.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.734
I mean there are still
so many questions to answer,

21:09.736 --> 21:11.269
You know, like,
where is the baby

21:11.271 --> 21:13.537
And why did dean munsch decide
to start doing this now,

21:13.539 --> 21:15.906
But I don't know, at least
we know we're all safe again.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.308
Grace.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.646
You know how after
the first time we kissed,

21:21.648 --> 21:24.081
You said we could not
keep making out

21:24.083 --> 21:26.484
Until we found
who the killer was.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.252
That's true. You know,

21:28.254 --> 21:29.453
We couldn't waste time kissing

21:29.455 --> 21:30.888
When people were in danger.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.924
But now they're
no longer in danger.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.925
I mean, you said it yourself.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.395
Did I?

21:38.731 --> 21:39.930
Well, then, I guess

21:39.932 --> 21:42.667
Circumstances have changed.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.578
(phone rings)

21:55.982 --> 21:58.115
Um, I...

21:58.117 --> 21:59.483
I should...

21:59.485 --> 22:00.751
Can that just...

22:00.753 --> 22:01.952
Sorry, sorry.
Please, yeah, yeah.

22:01.954 --> 22:05.089
Uh, hello?

22:06.159 --> 22:07.925
Oh, um, okay.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.694
Okay. See you soon.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.799
That was dean munsch calling
from the mental hospital.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.701
She said she needs
to see us tomorrow.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.643
Place is much nicer
than I thought it'd be.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.713
We don't show visitors
the gross parts of the hospital.

22:29.816 --> 22:30.948
It's too upsetting for them.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.650
Grace:
Isn't it also

22:32.652 --> 22:33.718
Upsetting for
the patients?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.019
Nurse:
Nah.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.354
They don't care. They're nuts.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.456
Dean munsch is this way.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.962
Dean munsch?

22:44.964 --> 22:46.030
Ah.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.399
Grace, peter,

22:48.401 --> 22:50.134
How lovely of you
to visit.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.402
Please, pull up a chair.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.003
I was just doing
a little sketching.

22:53.005 --> 22:56.907
Designing formal wear
is an old hobby of mine.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.009
With the running of the school,
I just haven't had

22:59.011 --> 23:01.045
A minute to sketch at all.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.848
Look what I've been able
to accomplish

23:03.850 --> 23:05.750
With a little free time.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.052
Wait, you like it here?

23:08.054 --> 23:10.488
Mm. This needs ice.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.391
Therapy twice a day.

23:13.393 --> 23:17.595
Plenty of time to rest
and dream again, you know.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.831
No booze, obviously,
but the meds are divine.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.533
The little blue ones

23:22.535 --> 23:26.003
Make you feel like your organs
are floating in a warm bath. Mm.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.073
I mean, picasso over there,
she's been here 30 years.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.342
She can leave
whenever she wants.

23:31.344 --> 23:33.411
She knows it doesn't get
any better than this.

23:33.413 --> 23:36.414
She likes to paint the patients.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.985
I paint them all.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.857
I'm sorry,
I just don't understand

23:46.859 --> 23:48.359
Why you called us down here.

23:48.361 --> 23:51.362
Look, I know
detective chisolm.

23:51.364 --> 23:54.231
And he's a nice man,
but he's lazy.

23:54.233 --> 23:57.935
He thinks this case is solved,
but it's not.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.870
And I know you two are

23:59.872 --> 24:02.406
Crackerjack
investigative reporters,

24:02.408 --> 24:04.942
And if I give you an acorn,
you're not gonna rest

24:04.944 --> 24:06.911
Until it is a giant tree.

24:06.913 --> 24:10.381
And I'm not gonna rest until
feather is hanging from a noose

24:10.383 --> 24:11.916
From its highest branch,

24:11.918 --> 24:13.984
Executed by the state
for the crime

24:13.986 --> 24:16.153
Of murdering my ex-husband.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.122
You think feather killed him?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.423
Oh, I know she did.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.125
And I wouldn't be surprised

24:21.127 --> 24:22.960
If she had
something to do with

24:22.962 --> 24:24.795
The other killings
going on around here.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.630
The girl is trouble.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.232
She always has been.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.633
You know, I knew she was no good

24:29.635 --> 24:31.735
As soon as I saw her
in that bathtub.

24:31.737 --> 24:34.605
I don't trust a girl
with a huge bush of pubic hair.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.106
Makes me think
she has something to hide.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.908
You mean when you tried
to electrocute her?

24:37.910 --> 24:39.610
Here's the thing, dean.

24:39.612 --> 24:42.947
We already did our story
on the death of your ex-husband,

24:42.949 --> 24:44.915
And it all led to you.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.016
Grace:
And now the story

24:46.018 --> 24:47.751
That we're working on

24:47.753 --> 24:50.120
Is about what happened
to that baby.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.690
Well, okay.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.192
You want to play
quid pro quo, clarice?

24:56.195 --> 24:58.095
Then you run along

24:58.097 --> 25:00.498
And you look into feather
for me.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.999
And when you bring back
the dirt on her,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.869
Then I'll tell you
about the little baby.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.337
Nurse:
Lunchtime.
(groans)

25:07.306 --> 25:09.006
Really?

25:09.008 --> 25:14.011
Nurse, I specifically told you
I cannot eat deli meats.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.348
The sulfites in them
send me into anaphylactic shock.

25:17.350 --> 25:21.018
No salami
and certainly no bologna!

25:21.020 --> 25:22.486
Really!

25:22.488 --> 25:24.655
It's a lawsuit!

25:24.657 --> 25:26.190
(sighs)

25:26.192 --> 25:27.992
So do we have an agreement?

25:27.994 --> 25:29.059
We do.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.060
Excellent.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.063
Fine. I'll be your lackey,

25:33.065 --> 25:35.666
But just because we want
that info on that baby.

25:35.668 --> 25:38.669
And I want you to know that
I think you killed them all,

25:38.671 --> 25:41.939
And I hope you get the
electric chair for it.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.377
Come on.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.945
Pete.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.052
Hey.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.024
Oh. Um, wow.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.059
You work fast.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.161
I paint them all.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.231
Well, thanks.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.803
Hey.

26:15.508 --> 26:18.442
How did you get chisolm
to give you all these?

26:18.444 --> 26:22.179
I threatened to file a freedom
of information act suit. Mm.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.715
Doesn't that take
a long time to go through?

26:24.717 --> 26:26.951
Yeah, but I told him it would
mean weeks of paperwork

26:26.953 --> 26:28.919
And a trip or two down
to the courthouse,

26:28.921 --> 26:31.755
So he just handed me the
key to his file cabinet.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.390
It's amazing,
dean munsch is right.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.926
He's seriously the laziest
detective of all time.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.927
Look.

26:36.929 --> 26:37.928
What is that?

26:37.930 --> 26:40.664
Looks like a
half-eaten sandwich.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.102
"investigators found
a half-eaten sandwich

26:45.104 --> 26:47.237
"covered in bloody fingerprints
near the lower right leg

26:47.239 --> 26:48.906
"of the departed dr. Munsch.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.140
"fingerprints were
obscured by gloves,

26:50.142 --> 26:51.542
"but considering
that the blood on the bread

26:51.544 --> 26:53.077
"was dr. Munsch's
and that his hand

26:53.079 --> 26:54.878
"was found
clear across the room

26:54.880 --> 26:56.714
"and without any gloves on,
investigators surmise

26:56.716 --> 26:59.717
That the killer made a sandwich
after murdering dr. Munsch."

26:59.719 --> 27:03.454
Does it say what kind
of sandwich it was?

27:03.456 --> 27:06.624
Um...

27:06.626 --> 27:08.659
Bologna.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.761
Dean munsch said she'd go
into shock if she ate bologna.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.830
Which means she couldn't have
made and eaten the sandwich.

27:12.832 --> 27:15.466
Which means she couldn't
have killed her ex-husband.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.434
Which means the killer
is still out there.

27:17.436 --> 27:20.104
(gasps) oh, my god, do you think
she's right and it's feather?

27:20.106 --> 27:22.406
We need to get some of
feather's dna and compare it

27:22.408 --> 27:25.576
To the dna
on the bologna sandwich.

27:25.578 --> 27:27.011
Her toothbrush.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.445
It must still be
at the crime scene, right?

27:28.447 --> 27:30.614
Let's go.
If she really is the killer,

27:30.616 --> 27:32.416
Then she could strike again
at any time.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.018
Means none of us are safe.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.252
Let's go.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.991
(thunder rumbling)

27:40.993 --> 27:45.863
Chanel #2, we're contacting you
from beyond the grave.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.031
Again.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.099
Chanel #3:
Are you there, chanel #2?

27:54.040 --> 27:57.041
Hi. Chanel #2, it's chanel.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.976
I've frickin'
had it with you!

27:58.978 --> 28:00.210
Thanks a bunch
for lying and saying

28:00.212 --> 28:02.112
That chad was cheating on me
with a goat,

28:02.114 --> 28:04.048
When in reality,
he has a disability

28:04.050 --> 28:06.450
And needs healthful,
lactose-free goat's milk.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.986
Technically, she just said
that he was cheating,

28:08.988 --> 28:10.988
But she never said anything
about a goat.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.990
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to a dead girl!

28:12.992 --> 28:15.025
Hester:
Chanel #2,

28:15.027 --> 28:18.062
If this is really you,
use your magical dead powers

28:18.064 --> 28:20.731
To tell me how many tampons
I have in my purse.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.034
Oh, my god!

28:24.036 --> 28:27.237
She is right. She is right.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.639
Why do you have nine tampons?

28:28.641 --> 28:30.107
How big is your cooch?

28:38.918 --> 28:40.150
(sighs)

28:40.152 --> 28:42.986
Chanel #2,

28:42.988 --> 28:45.489
If it's really you,
use your special dead telepathy

28:45.491 --> 28:48.025
To answer a question no one
knows the answer to but me.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.260
When I was two,
what breakfast cereal

28:50.262 --> 28:53.831
Did I accidentally breathe
into my lungs and nearly die?

28:53.833 --> 28:56.834
Oh, my god, it's moving.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.802
I...

29:00.740 --> 29:02.005
X...

29:02.007 --> 29:04.108
Dix? You choked on dix?

29:04.110 --> 29:05.375
Kix!

29:05.377 --> 29:06.643
I choked on kix.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.546
It's real. She knew.

29:09.548 --> 29:12.382
Okay, guys, I really think
we should stop,

29:12.384 --> 29:14.418
Because this is
really, really freaking me out.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.186
No, hooker! We're not stopping.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.022
If this really is chanel #2,

29:19.024 --> 29:21.091
Then she'll know the answer
to the real question.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.927
Chanel #2,
who's killing everybody?

29:32.471 --> 29:33.771
(all gasp)

29:33.773 --> 29:35.205
She says you are.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.141
That's it!

29:37.143 --> 29:40.410
I am done with this
dead, lying bitch!

29:40.412 --> 29:41.979
I'm done with you, number two!

29:41.981 --> 29:46.049
Have fun in hell going to
dinner with osama bin laden.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.823
Get in here. Close the door.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.927
Chanel #2 is telling us
the truth from beyond the grave.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.163
Chanel is the killer.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.431
But, I mean, can we really trust
a satanic talking board?

30:01.433 --> 30:03.167
It knew how many tampons.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.002
Talking boards
tend not to hold up in court.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.004
Even if it did, there's no jail
that can hold her.

30:07.006 --> 30:09.506
Last time we sent her to jail,
she immediately got bailed out.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.108
I mean, yeah, by me, but...

30:11.110 --> 30:13.744
No one is safe. She's onto us.

30:13.746 --> 30:15.813
She is the killer,
and she is gonna come after us.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.147
There's only one solution.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.515
Flee?

30:18.517 --> 30:19.783
No!

30:19.785 --> 30:22.586
We have to kill chanel.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.998
Okay. So we're all agreed
chanel has to die.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.366
Right?
Right.

30:36.368 --> 30:37.501
Yeah, okay, I guess.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.936
But the question is: How?

30:38.938 --> 30:40.971
We have to be
super sneaky about it,

30:40.973 --> 30:42.973
Because if we're not, she'll
smell a rat and kill us first.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.942
I say we poison her bras.
What?

30:44.944 --> 30:46.643
We soak all of her bras
in poison,

30:46.645 --> 30:48.345
And then once they dry
and she puts one on,

30:48.347 --> 30:49.713
We're like,
"chanel, there's a new

30:49.715 --> 30:51.715
Barneys co-op down the street.
Hurry."

30:51.717 --> 30:53.717
And then she'll put one on,
and she'll start running,

30:53.719 --> 30:56.119
And she'll start to sweat,
and then the poison will

30:56.121 --> 30:57.888
Seep through her nips
and kill her.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.723
That's a horrible idea!

30:59.725 --> 31:00.724
Okay.

31:00.726 --> 31:01.892
How about this?

31:01.894 --> 31:03.193
We take all of chanel's diamonds

31:03.195 --> 31:05.362
And we crush them into a powder,
and then we have

31:05.364 --> 31:07.197
A sugar party where everyone
eats bowls of sugar.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.999
Except chanel's bowl
isn't filled with sugar,

31:09.001 --> 31:10.834
It's powdered diamonds

31:10.836 --> 31:14.004
That slice open her esophagus
and kill her from the inside.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.206
What the hell is a sugar party?

31:16.208 --> 31:17.574
Okay, who just

31:17.576 --> 31:19.009
Sits around
eating bowls of sugar?

31:19.011 --> 31:20.811
And how do you even
crush a diamond?

31:20.813 --> 31:22.045
It's, like, the hardest
substance on earth.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.046
Shut up, number five.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.848
It's a great idea.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.083
You're just pissed you
didn't think of it.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.150
Chanel:
Think of what?

31:29.822 --> 31:31.421
What's a great idea?

31:31.423 --> 31:32.689
Nothing, chanel. We were
just talking about

31:32.691 --> 31:33.991
Throwing a sugar party.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.392
Oh, where everyone just eats
bowls of sugar?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.393
Yeah, I love those.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.061
Love it.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.029
Has anyone seen my prunex?

31:39.031 --> 31:41.565
I'm not feeling well.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.933
What's prunex?

31:42.935 --> 31:45.002
It's a liquid
laxative, number five!

31:45.004 --> 31:46.436
Some of us with souls,
who aren't

31:46.438 --> 31:49.039
Friendless psychopaths,
find that the stress

31:49.041 --> 31:50.607
Of having a mass-murderer
on campus

31:50.609 --> 31:52.376
Makes them slightly irregular.

31:52.378 --> 31:55.112
Now, I'm taking some prunex
and I'm going to bed!

31:56.081 --> 31:58.081
Here it is. Hmm.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.184
Good night, sluts.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.155
(exhales)

32:07.092 --> 32:09.259
We're doing it. Tonight.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.561
Once the prunex
knocks her out cold,

32:11.563 --> 32:13.597
We're murdering chanel.

32:16.936 --> 32:19.002
♪ ♪

32:33.652 --> 32:35.652
(gasps)

32:35.654 --> 32:37.087
You.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.922
What are you doing here?

32:38.924 --> 32:40.891
Hey, chanel. It's chanel #2.

32:40.893 --> 32:42.092
Yeah, I know who you are.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.327
I asked what you're doing here.

32:43.329 --> 32:44.494
I thought you were dead.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.663
I am dead. I'm burning in hell.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.099
I came back from the grave
to apologize to you.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.001
What? Seriously?

32:51.003 --> 32:52.135
That's right.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.136
See, despite what you've heard,

32:53.138 --> 32:55.105
Hell sucks; it's not fun.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.340
Yes, there are waterslides,

32:56.342 --> 32:57.941
But they're lined with
razor blades

32:57.943 --> 33:00.110
And you splash down into a pool
of boiling pee.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.111
Also,

33:01.113 --> 33:02.012
Zero dinosaurs.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.180
There's no dinosaurs?

33:03.182 --> 33:04.982
No. As soon as I got there,

33:04.984 --> 33:06.516
I was like,
"where are the dinosaurs?"

33:06.518 --> 33:08.452
And they were like, "we know.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.853
Jesus broke in and stole them."

33:09.855 --> 33:10.921
(scoffs)

33:10.923 --> 33:12.990
Also, do you know
what my job is?

33:12.992 --> 33:14.591
I have to pick food

33:14.593 --> 33:16.793
Out of uday
and qusay hussein's beards

33:16.795 --> 33:19.429
With my teeth
for the rest of eternity.
Ew.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.631
So yesterday I marched
right up to the front desk

33:21.633 --> 33:23.467
And I'm like, "what do I have to
do to get to heaven?"

33:23.469 --> 33:24.968
And do you know
what carl sagan said to me?

33:24.970 --> 33:26.336
That I had to make

33:26.338 --> 33:28.038
Things right with you, chanel.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.973
So that's what I'm here to do.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.208
The truth is,

33:31.210 --> 33:33.210
(sighs) I always admired you.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.445
I'm sorry I never told you.

33:35.447 --> 33:39.216
I guess I was just intimidated
by your beauty and intelligence.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.951
(chuckles)

33:40.953 --> 33:42.986
And I'm sorry
I had sex with chad radwell.

33:42.988 --> 33:45.155
I was just jealous.
I wanted what you had,

33:45.157 --> 33:47.891
And I really needed
my tube packed.

33:47.893 --> 33:50.394
Well, why did you use
that satanic talking board

33:50.396 --> 33:52.129
To tell everyone
he cheated on me

33:52.131 --> 33:53.530
And that I was the killer?

33:53.532 --> 33:55.165
I don't know. I'm sorry.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.967
I was just probably
in a bad mood

33:56.969 --> 33:59.136
'cause adolf hitler
was motor-boating my boobs.

33:59.138 --> 34:02.472
Well, thank you, chanel #2.

34:02.474 --> 34:06.043
I accept your apology.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.311
And I'm sorry you got murdered
and are dead.

34:08.313 --> 34:11.148
(sighs) there's something else
I should tell you,

34:11.150 --> 34:13.850
Something important.

34:13.852 --> 34:15.218
The other chanels are gonna try
to murder you, chanel.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.887
They're gonna try
to murder you tonight.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.688
What?
They're on their way back
from the mall

34:18.690 --> 34:19.723
With a bowling ball
they're gonna use

34:19.725 --> 34:20.991
To bash your skull in

34:20.993 --> 34:22.826
As soon as you pass out
from your prunex.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.428
Well, looks like I'll have
to kill them first.

34:24.430 --> 34:26.063
No! Be the bigger person!

34:26.065 --> 34:27.097
(sighs)

34:27.099 --> 34:28.065
These girls need you.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.866
Kappa house needs you.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.668
Now rise up

34:31.670 --> 34:33.570
And be the leader
I know you can be.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.307
(gasps, sighs)

34:54.760 --> 34:57.127
(dog barking in distance)

34:59.932 --> 35:01.164
(groans)

35:02.201 --> 35:04.067
Are you okay?
Yeah, I just,

35:04.069 --> 35:06.036
I just get a little faint
when I see blood.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.072
All right, let's go.

35:09.074 --> 35:11.074
Which one
do you think is hers?

35:11.076 --> 35:12.976
The pink one.
It looks newer.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.112
Old people toothbrushes
are always super worn down

35:15.114 --> 35:16.713
And have that rubber
tip thing at the end.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.381
Okay. So now we have to give
this to the cops

35:18.383 --> 35:20.617
So we can compare the dna
and wait for the results.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.719
All right, all right, all right.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.588
A perfect dna match.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.089
That is what the lab said.

35:26.091 --> 35:27.924
The person that used
this toothbrush

35:27.926 --> 35:30.927
Is the same person that bit
into that bologna sandwich.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.229
I should have figured
it out myself.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.297
It always bugged me
why someone

35:34.299 --> 35:35.799
Would go through
all that effort

35:35.801 --> 35:37.934
To make a sandwich
and not finish it.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.136
It's pretty suspicious behavior.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.304
So the dna on that toothbrush

35:41.306 --> 35:44.107
And the sandwich
definitely belongs to feather?

35:44.109 --> 35:45.942
Without a doubt, she killed him.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.111
And I guess all of that killing

35:48.113 --> 35:49.513
<i>And dismembering</i>

35:49.515 --> 35:51.314
<i>And pretending</i>
<i>that it wasn't her</i>

35:51.316 --> 35:52.916
<i>Made her hungry--</i>

35:52.918 --> 35:55.285
<i>But not that hungry.</i>

35:55.287 --> 35:57.420
If she would only have had
a bigger appetite,

35:57.422 --> 35:58.688
She might have
gotten away with it.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.590
Anyway, great work guys.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.025
The force owes you one.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.827
The whole campus does,
I suppose.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.796
Clearly feather mccarthy
is our red devil.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.031
But what about dean munsch?

36:08.033 --> 36:10.300
(door closes)
oh, mommy's home.

36:10.302 --> 36:13.270
I was released as soon
as feather was arrested.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.471
I'm sorry

36:14.473 --> 36:15.805
I didn't get to see her

36:15.807 --> 36:17.007
Dragged away in chains.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.808
I heard she cried
like a little bitch.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.210
Do you really think
she's responsible

36:20.212 --> 36:22.112
For all of the killings
on campus?

36:22.114 --> 36:24.781
And how is she related
to what happened here in 1995?

36:24.783 --> 36:26.349
Well, I can't be sure,

36:26.351 --> 36:28.985
But what I do know
is that feather mccarthy

36:28.987 --> 36:30.353
Is feather mcnutty.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.056
I did a little digging,

36:33.058 --> 36:36.126
And it turns out
that feather had a web site

36:36.128 --> 36:39.462
Called "ilovebologna.Org".

36:39.464 --> 36:40.997
And she's what
a psychiatrist

36:40.999 --> 36:44.134
Friend of mine refers
to as a "capicolaphilist"

36:44.136 --> 36:46.036
Which is not, as I thought,
someone who's turned on

36:46.038 --> 36:47.170
By the sight and feel

36:47.172 --> 36:48.705
Of lunch meats but,

36:48.707 --> 36:50.173
More disgustingly,
someone who's turned on

36:50.175 --> 36:52.909
By someone
who pronounces bologna

36:52.911 --> 36:54.844
The way it's spelled--
"bow-log-na."

36:54.846 --> 36:56.213
That is what we
down at the station

36:56.215 --> 36:58.181
Like to call
an "orgy of evidence."

36:58.183 --> 36:59.683
Mmm.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.751
Now, we don't actually have
a motive

37:01.753 --> 37:03.086
That ties her to all

37:03.088 --> 37:04.688
The other recent killings,

37:04.690 --> 37:06.423
But, you know,
statistically speaking,

37:06.425 --> 37:08.225
The chances that there is
a woman capable

37:08.227 --> 37:10.060
Of murdering and
dismembering

37:10.062 --> 37:11.895
Her boyfriend
and then a whole other

37:11.897 --> 37:13.496
Crazy, creative killer

37:13.498 --> 37:16.666
On one campus at the same time
are pretty slim.

37:16.668 --> 37:19.703
I didn't run the numbers,
but they'd have to be, right?

37:19.705 --> 37:21.371
Yes.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.039
And thanks to
you two go-getters,

37:23.041 --> 37:25.008
Order has not
just been restored--

37:25.010 --> 37:27.010
It has been improved!

37:27.012 --> 37:28.578
Hold on.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.915
What?
We had a deal.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.450
(sighs)
tell me what
happened to the baby.

37:33.452 --> 37:36.019
And how feather is related
to all this.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.254
No way she's the killer

37:37.256 --> 37:38.888
If she doesn't have
a connection.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.358
Come to my office alone.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.592
Next week.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.960
Next week?

37:43.962 --> 37:45.028
I'm running

37:45.030 --> 37:47.063
An institution
of higher learning

37:47.065 --> 37:49.132
And designing dresses
for awards season.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.935
Give me a break.

37:54.239 --> 37:56.239
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

37:56.241 --> 37:58.108
I know what you three are up to.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.576
You're plotting to murder me.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.045
What? No!
Chanel, that's insane.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.047
I would sooner kill
my own mother.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.448
Can it, manatees!
I know the truth

38:05.450 --> 38:07.951
Because I'm smarter
than all of you.

38:07.953 --> 38:11.454
What I'm curious about is what,
exactly, is taking so long?

38:11.456 --> 38:13.790
We couldn't agree
on how to do it.
Shh!
Shut up, number three.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.792
Well, what method
were you leaning towards?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.594
We were going to put rat poison
in your prunex.

38:17.596 --> 38:18.762
But I was worried
you'd taste it

38:18.764 --> 38:19.896
And know you'd been poisoned

38:19.898 --> 38:21.064
And run to the hospital.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.167
See, this is why
you turdlets need me.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.769
You're not even
competent enough

38:25.771 --> 38:27.971
To kill one lousy
sorority co-president.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.939
Newsflash, felchers:
Rat poison only works

38:29.941 --> 38:32.742
Because rodents
don't have a gag reflex.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.110
If you gave a human rat poison,

38:34.112 --> 38:35.645
They would immediately
puke it all up,

38:35.647 --> 38:37.747
So not only would
I have survived

38:37.749 --> 38:39.316
Your attempt on my life,

38:39.318 --> 38:41.418
It would have
also made me skinnier.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.153
I'm so sorry, chanel.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.788
It was stupid
to try to murder you.
We only did it

38:44.790 --> 38:46.423
Because we thought
that you were the killer!

38:46.425 --> 38:49.926
(sighs) I'm willing to
let bygones be bygones

38:49.928 --> 38:52.629
And chalk this attempted murder
up to youthful enthusiasm.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.331
And I'm sorry, too.
You're not the only ones

38:54.333 --> 38:55.965
Who think I could be
a better leader.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.867
Chanel #2 appeared to me
last night

38:57.869 --> 39:01.338
In a prunex fever dream and said
essentially the same thing.

39:01.340 --> 39:04.441
So in an effort to buy back
your friendship,

39:04.443 --> 39:06.176
I got you all presents.

39:17.289 --> 39:18.621
We are gonna use
these nancy drew-looking

39:18.623 --> 39:19.856
Sleuthing caps

39:19.858 --> 39:22.025
And enormous magnifying glasses

39:22.027 --> 39:23.059
And catch the killer as a team.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.061
But they already
caught the killer.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.130
Trust me. That feather
didn't kill anyone.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.698
She's too stupid.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.834
When I first met her,
she asked me what my name was

39:30.836 --> 39:32.402
And then asked me
what her name was.

39:32.404 --> 39:34.904
Wait, if feather's not
the killer, who is?

39:34.906 --> 39:37.674
There are two killers, and their
names are grace and zayday.

39:37.676 --> 39:38.842
I'll remind you

39:38.844 --> 39:40.210
That this killing spree began

39:40.212 --> 39:42.078
When those two walked
into this house.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.847
They're trying to bring
down this sorority

39:43.849 --> 39:45.782
And steal our hot,
popular boyfriends.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.151
The four of us are gonna expose

39:48.153 --> 39:50.053
Those sluts for
the killers they are

39:50.055 --> 39:52.322
And restore order
to kappa kappa tau.

39:52.324 --> 39:54.924
Do I make myself clear,
you whores?

39:56.395 --> 39:57.994
Good.
