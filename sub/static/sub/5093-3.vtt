00:26.250 --> 00:28.050
(panting)

00:33.740 --> 00:35.925
(elevator bell dings)

00:35.927 --> 00:36.943
Good morning, Frank.

00:36.945 --> 00:37.960
Apparently not.

00:37.962 --> 00:39.178
Why do you say that?

00:39.180 --> 00:40.596
You're hovering already.

00:40.598 --> 00:42.732
The <i>Irish Times</i> is gonna
have a reporter covering

00:42.734 --> 00:45.184
your breakfast with the
prime minister this morning.

00:45.186 --> 00:49.021
Also, CNN is requesting a
brief and painless interview

00:49.023 --> 00:52.992
regarding the department's
counter terrorism division.

00:52.994 --> 00:54.944
They are seldom brief
and never painless.

00:54.946 --> 00:56.512
I'll take that as a yes.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.164
And you're hovering because?

00:58.166 --> 01:02.001
We had a visit from
the NYPD Legal Bureau.

01:02.003 --> 01:03.453
This is a copy of the subpoena.

01:03.455 --> 01:05.872
A subpoena for what?
A dealer

01:05.874 --> 01:07.590
is going to trial
for selling heroin.

01:07.592 --> 01:08.958
His lawyer contends that it

01:08.960 --> 01:10.960
was illegal for police
to stop and search him

01:10.962 --> 01:12.995
in a private
residential building,

01:12.997 --> 01:15.348
so his arrest should be vacated.

01:15.350 --> 01:17.884
You are being subpoenaed
to answer questions

01:17.886 --> 01:19.952
about the department's
safe building policy.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.554
But, wait, there's more.

01:21.556 --> 01:22.638
What?

01:22.640 --> 01:24.673
The attorney's Jack Boyle.

01:24.675 --> 01:27.026
Erin's ex?

01:30.347 --> 01:31.397
MAN:
People v.

01:31.399 --> 01:33.065
David Powell on the charge

01:33.067 --> 01:34.867
of criminal possession
of a controlled substance

01:34.869 --> 01:36.285
in the first degree.

01:36.287 --> 01:38.988
Jack Boyle, Your Honor,
of Boyle, Baxter and Russell,

01:38.990 --> 01:40.189
counsel for the defense.

01:40.191 --> 01:41.690
How do you plead?

01:41.692 --> 01:43.159
Not guilty.

01:43.161 --> 01:45.861
People, would you like
to be heard on bail?

01:45.863 --> 01:50.466
Uh, Erin Reagan-Boyle
for the People, Your Honor.

01:50.468 --> 01:52.535
Based on his priors,
the state requests

01:52.537 --> 01:54.637
a $25,000 bail.
First things first.

01:54.639 --> 01:58.508
Your Honor, the arrest
of Mr. Powell began with

01:58.510 --> 02:01.143
an unconstitutional stop inside
his building of residence.

02:01.145 --> 02:02.762
Seriously?

02:02.764 --> 02:06.766
Your Honor, Mr. Powell
had ten ounces of heroin on him

02:06.768 --> 02:08.451
and the details
of the stop are

02:08.453 --> 02:10.303
arguments for the trial,
not the arraignment.

02:10.305 --> 02:11.387
We waive all written motions.

02:11.389 --> 02:12.738
We will not entertain any pleas.

02:12.740 --> 02:15.024
Uh, we are going to fight this.

02:15.026 --> 02:16.776
And as long as we're
granted a pretrial

02:16.778 --> 02:19.979
hearing, we are prepared
to move forward immediately.

02:19.981 --> 02:21.581
In regards to the defense
request to go straight to trial,

02:21.583 --> 02:23.583
are the People prepared?

02:23.585 --> 02:26.569
Oh, the People
are ready for trial.

02:26.571 --> 02:28.788
Last name Boyle.

02:30.007 --> 02:31.340
Any relation?

02:31.342 --> 02:32.742
Not anymore, Your Honor.

02:32.744 --> 02:34.977
Is that a problem,
Your Honor?

02:34.979 --> 02:36.462
Not for me, no.

02:36.464 --> 02:37.547
For you,

02:37.549 --> 02:39.582
well, all-all
I can say is

02:39.584 --> 02:42.435
I'm looking forward
to presiding over the trail.

02:42.437 --> 02:45.338
Bail is set at $20,000.

02:45.340 --> 02:48.324
(gavel bangs)

02:48.326 --> 02:50.226
BOYLE:
Check on the 20...

02:50.228 --> 02:51.427
Okay.
Excuse me one second. Hi.

02:51.429 --> 02:54.280
Would have been nice to
have a heads up, Jack.

02:54.282 --> 02:55.898
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.
No could do.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.149
Really?

02:57.151 --> 02:59.935
Yeah, really, I had a subpoena
to serve in the case.

02:59.937 --> 03:01.287
Not to me.

03:01.289 --> 03:03.923
No, uh, no, to your dad.

03:03.925 --> 03:05.658
You did what?

03:05.660 --> 03:07.276
It's nothing personal.

03:07.278 --> 03:09.879
And you would have done
the same thing and you know it.

03:11.465 --> 03:14.000
That's a very nice suit,
by the way.

03:14.002 --> 03:16.752
What are you...
just in town for the trial?

03:16.754 --> 03:18.421
Uh, who knows?

03:18.423 --> 03:20.139
Well, you should.

03:20.141 --> 03:24.627
Nah, you know me, as soon as
it ain't as much fun anymore,

03:24.629 --> 03:27.063
uh, I am out the door.

03:27.065 --> 03:30.600
I'm gonna have to sleep
on that one for, like, a week.

03:32.319 --> 03:33.936
Hey, I'm sure
that you have a...

03:33.938 --> 03:37.073
a lot planned
for Nicky's Sweet 16.

03:37.075 --> 03:38.407
Give me a couple of windows,

03:38.409 --> 03:40.009
I'd like to do
something special with her.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.861
She's free all day Saturday,

03:41.863 --> 03:43.763
but you really should
check with her.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.814
Can I drop you?

03:45.816 --> 03:48.000
You already did.

03:49.453 --> 03:52.038
I had that coming.

03:52.956 --> 03:53.956
FRANK:
<i>Again,</i>

03:53.958 --> 03:55.124
pleasure,
Mr. Prime Minister.

03:55.126 --> 03:56.692
Thank you, Commissioner.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.644
Detective Baker
will show you out.

03:58.646 --> 03:59.612
Good luck at the UN.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.464
Safe trip back to Dublin.

04:01.466 --> 04:05.017
Tell me I don't have to answer
that subpoena in person.

04:05.019 --> 04:06.686
You want the truth or just
what you want to hear?

04:06.688 --> 04:08.771
Both.
You don't have to appear,

04:08.773 --> 04:10.106
legal's taking care of it.

04:10.108 --> 04:11.307
Really?

04:11.309 --> 04:12.441
(laughs)
Yeah, really.

04:12.443 --> 04:14.443
(door opens)
Yes, Baker?

04:14.445 --> 04:17.196
The winner of the Commissioner
for a Day contest is here.

04:17.197 --> 04:19.781
Okay, let's have him.
Jordan Silva,

04:19.784 --> 04:22.518
18, East New York.

04:23.837 --> 04:25.905
What's up?

04:27.024 --> 04:28.524
Jordan Silva,
I'd like to introduce

04:28.526 --> 04:29.959
Commissioner Frank Reagan.

04:31.662 --> 04:32.662
Congratulations.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.747
Thanks.

04:34.749 --> 04:36.415
When you come back,
I'll show you around

04:36.417 --> 04:38.834
and fill you in on what
we'll be doing today.

04:38.836 --> 04:40.803
When I come back from where?

04:40.805 --> 04:42.338
From going home to put on

04:42.340 --> 04:44.640
attire appropriate
for this office.

04:45.592 --> 04:47.009
And lose the jewelry.

04:58.505 --> 05:00.156
What do we got, partner?

05:00.158 --> 05:01.323
Uh, two gunshots--

05:01.325 --> 05:03.943
one to the back of the head,
one in the crotch.

05:03.945 --> 05:05.528
Oh. Nine millimeter?

05:05.530 --> 05:07.613
Same as the Ramos murder
last week.

05:07.615 --> 05:09.665
Ah, great.
got any witnesses?

05:09.667 --> 05:11.617
Well, just the dog.

05:13.837 --> 05:14.920
All right, so we

05:14.922 --> 05:16.622
got the same exact M.O.
as the first one, huh?

05:16.624 --> 05:17.807
Yeah, both

05:17.809 --> 05:20.042
shot in the back of the head,
both in the crotch.

05:20.044 --> 05:21.677
Both hit in the
early morning hours

05:21.679 --> 05:23.379
at close range
with a nine millimeter.

05:23.381 --> 05:25.014
Well, good morning, New York.

05:25.016 --> 05:27.349
Looks like we got ourselves
a serial killer.

05:40.989 --> 05:51.346
♪

06:00.528 --> 06:01.561
I filed a motion

06:01.563 --> 06:02.829
to quash the subpoena, citing

06:02.831 --> 06:04.081
Dad on the stand would be

06:04.083 --> 06:05.582
irrelevant and inflammatory.

06:05.584 --> 06:06.750
Claw it back.

06:06.752 --> 06:08.385
Why?
Our lawyers

06:08.387 --> 06:10.821
are taking care of it,
quietly and leakproof.

06:10.823 --> 06:12.289
(sighs)

06:13.458 --> 06:15.375
So, he doesn't even get
a mention in the papers.

06:15.377 --> 06:17.377
Not if it goes the way we hope.

06:18.429 --> 06:19.629
You'll rescind your motion?

06:19.631 --> 06:21.648
Right away.

06:21.650 --> 06:23.683
Garrett?

06:23.685 --> 06:27.154
I'll, uh, come back.

06:27.156 --> 06:29.889
I should be going.

06:29.891 --> 06:31.491
May I say something?

06:31.493 --> 06:32.826
Do I have a choice?

06:32.828 --> 06:35.078
I stand where I stood
two years ago,

06:35.080 --> 06:37.091
and if he disappoints Nicky
one more time...

06:37.116 --> 06:37.698
Dad?

06:37.699 --> 06:39.916
I am not here to rehash my past.

06:39.918 --> 06:42.452
Subpoenaing me was
a nonstarter and he knew it.

06:42.454 --> 06:44.454
Okay, I don't
need a lecture, Dad.

06:44.456 --> 06:46.757
I'm not lecturing,
I'm reminding.

06:46.759 --> 06:48.675
He knows how to get to you.

06:48.677 --> 06:51.211
I'll keep that in mind.

06:51.213 --> 06:54.498
(deep breath)

06:58.186 --> 07:00.270
You come up with anything
on that tattoo there,

07:00.272 --> 07:01.555
the, uh, "fury"?

07:01.557 --> 07:03.473
No, I haven't
seen it before.

07:03.475 --> 07:05.108
Looks like a
gang tat though.

07:05.110 --> 07:06.443
What do you know
about this guy?

07:06.445 --> 07:09.896
Uh, we've got Eduardo Munoz,
22, from Sunset Park.

07:09.898 --> 07:10.947
Two gunshots.

07:10.949 --> 07:13.650
First shot struck
the right orbital plate.

07:13.652 --> 07:15.569
Uh, basically shot
to the head, no exit.

07:15.571 --> 07:19.156
Second shot tore through
his penis and interior

07:19.158 --> 07:21.191
urethra at close range.

07:21.193 --> 07:23.910
Every time I say that phrase,

07:23.912 --> 07:25.745
men instinctively
cover their privates.

07:27.882 --> 07:30.783
How close was the shooter?

07:30.785 --> 07:32.669
Mmm, about...

07:32.671 --> 07:35.672
about this close.

07:35.674 --> 07:36.923
That's close.

07:36.925 --> 07:38.425
A close range shot to the groin,

07:38.427 --> 07:41.178
doesn't get more
personal than that.

07:46.017 --> 07:47.734
Hey, Mom.

07:47.736 --> 07:50.520
Shoot. It's your half day.

07:50.522 --> 07:53.890
We're supposed to be shopping
for the dress for your party.

07:53.892 --> 07:56.142
But it doesn't look like it.

07:56.144 --> 07:57.611
Yeah, I'm kind of...

07:57.613 --> 07:59.679
Got it, no worries.

08:00.998 --> 08:02.866
Dad came by school.

08:03.868 --> 08:05.585
Charmed my English teacher.

08:05.587 --> 08:07.487
Did he?

08:07.489 --> 08:09.539
He told me he wanted
to take me out for my birthday.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.625
Well, he is your father.

08:11.627 --> 08:13.560
So, you're cool with it?

08:13.562 --> 08:15.962
As long as you are.

08:15.964 --> 08:18.431
Sounds like he may be here
for a while.

08:18.433 --> 08:20.550
Well, we'll see.

08:20.552 --> 08:23.086
Can I ask you
one quick question?

08:23.088 --> 08:24.838
Yeah, shoot.

08:24.840 --> 08:28.475
Is opposing him in court
kind of...

08:28.477 --> 08:30.443
uncomfortable?

08:30.445 --> 08:33.780
Absolutely.

08:33.782 --> 08:36.683
Does seeing Dad
ever make you miss him?

08:36.684 --> 08:37.951
Even a little bit?

08:37.953 --> 08:40.035
Or do you just
wish you never

08:40.038 --> 08:41.738
even got married
in the first place?

08:41.740 --> 08:44.024
That's two questions.

08:44.025 --> 08:46.826
Goes to the witness's
frame of mind, Your Honor.

08:50.531 --> 08:54.718
If we had never gotten married,
I wouldn't have you

08:54.720 --> 08:56.869
and you are, by far,
the greatest thing

08:56.871 --> 08:59.039
I have ever accomplished.

09:04.061 --> 09:06.613
And while a lot of things
go into making any decision,

09:06.615 --> 09:08.415
what I try to keep foremost

09:08.417 --> 09:10.650
in my mind is
the public safety.

09:10.652 --> 09:12.152
Thank you so much, Commissioner.

09:12.154 --> 09:13.687
My pleasure, Jessica.

09:13.689 --> 09:16.456
If I may ask your
Commissioner for a Day winner

09:16.458 --> 09:17.991
a quick question?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.944
Sure.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.533
What's been your impression
of Commissioner Reagan?

09:26.535 --> 09:30.203
Uh, I think he's a very,
um, powerful guy

09:30.205 --> 09:32.923
with a very
influential position.

09:32.925 --> 09:35.292
We don't have
time for this.

09:35.294 --> 09:37.010
We are due downstairs
for a Sports League

09:37.012 --> 09:39.713
lunch reception now,
but thank you, Jess.

09:39.715 --> 09:42.015
Thank you both
for being on time

09:42.017 --> 09:44.217
as our window is very small.

09:44.219 --> 09:45.835
What did you think?

09:45.837 --> 09:47.387
You're good at sound bites.

09:47.389 --> 09:49.222
So are you.

09:49.224 --> 09:51.641
"Powerful" and "influential,"
both descriptive,

09:51.643 --> 09:53.126
yet non-committal.

09:53.128 --> 09:56.863
So, she asked you a lot
about, uh, public safety.

09:56.865 --> 09:58.198
The way I see it, you're more

09:58.200 --> 10:01.001
interested in the public safety
of places like Park Slope

10:01.003 --> 10:02.902
and the Upper East Side.

10:05.539 --> 10:08.241
How heavy is that?

10:08.243 --> 10:09.809
The chip on your shoulder?

10:09.811 --> 10:11.628
I just tell it like it is.

10:11.630 --> 10:12.796
Oh, do you now?

10:12.798 --> 10:14.297
Did you know that under
Commissioner Reagan,

10:14.299 --> 10:18.501
New York City is enjoying the
lowest crime rate since 1964?

10:18.503 --> 10:21.054
Well, in my neighborhood
someone gets shot to death

10:21.056 --> 10:22.922
and it ends up on page 30

10:22.924 --> 10:25.508
of the newspaper
in an article this big.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.427
East New York,
your neighborhood,

10:27.429 --> 10:29.729
leads this city
in rapes, robberies,

10:29.731 --> 10:30.981
murders and felony assaults.

10:30.983 --> 10:32.232
Why do you think that is?

10:32.234 --> 10:35.235
'Cause no one cares,
including the cops.

10:35.237 --> 10:39.138
You need to wait
by the elevator.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.611
Historically, the Commissioner
for a Day winners

10:44.613 --> 10:46.997
just spend less than an hour
with the commissioner,

10:46.999 --> 10:48.865
so your work here is done.

10:48.867 --> 10:51.051
It's my time and I'm not done.

10:51.053 --> 10:52.585
So, not yet.

10:52.587 --> 10:54.371
Care to share why?

10:54.373 --> 10:57.290
Again, not yet.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.961
Well, you gotta admit,
Jack's got balls.

11:01.963 --> 11:04.047
You want me to beat him up
or something?

11:04.049 --> 11:07.133
If you remember, that didn't go
over for you too well last time.

11:07.135 --> 11:09.135
Hold on, the guy's got
two feet on me,

11:09.137 --> 11:10.670
and besides,
he didn't fight fair.

11:10.672 --> 11:12.598
Well, that's what makes
him a good attorney.

11:12.623 --> 11:13.224
Yeah.

11:13.225 --> 11:15.809
Well, he did charm
everyone in the family

11:15.811 --> 11:16.943
(sighs)

11:16.945 --> 11:18.311
The case you're here about?

11:18.313 --> 11:19.529
Right.

11:19.531 --> 11:22.515
Yeah, Eduardo Munoz
and John Ramos,

11:22.517 --> 11:24.067
both acquitted
on charges of, uh...

11:24.069 --> 11:25.351
Rape in the first degree,

11:25.353 --> 11:27.270
along with Martin Cabrera
and Richard Turkel.

11:27.272 --> 11:29.489
Right. Well, Munoz and Ramos
both turned up dead

11:29.491 --> 11:30.790
within a week of each other.

11:30.792 --> 11:32.492
Can't say I'm sorry about that.

11:32.494 --> 11:34.127
Danny, this is Pete Freehill.

11:34.129 --> 11:35.862
He is the detective
who worked the case.

11:35.864 --> 11:38.114
Apparently didn't
work it well enough.

11:38.116 --> 11:39.549
Hey, it happens.

11:39.551 --> 11:41.668
More like, the jury
didn't do the right thing.

11:41.670 --> 11:43.536
Right, so, uh,
what happened with it?

11:43.538 --> 11:45.872
Well, these four guys

11:45.874 --> 11:48.224
gang-raped an 18-year-old girl
on her way home from a party.

11:48.226 --> 11:49.976
Uh-huh.
She ID'd them the next day,

11:49.978 --> 11:51.227
and I scooped 'em up.

11:51.229 --> 11:53.313
ERIN: They were arrested,
grand jury indicted,

11:53.315 --> 11:55.348
but when it went to trial,

11:55.350 --> 11:57.717
the defense team called
the DNA evidence into question.

11:57.719 --> 11:59.218
It was mixed
in such a way

11:59.220 --> 12:02.155
that the analyst couldn't
get a single profile.

12:02.157 --> 12:04.056
So the jury let 'em walk.

12:04.058 --> 12:06.058
Well, you said
there were four guys.

12:06.060 --> 12:07.694
The other two,
they still on the street?

12:07.696 --> 12:09.946
Yeah, Cabrera and Turkel,
two lowlifes.

12:09.948 --> 12:12.282
I'm just waiting for
them to come back around

12:12.284 --> 12:13.566
so we can get it
right next time.

12:13.568 --> 12:15.301
You're thinking
they may be next?

12:15.303 --> 12:16.586
Well, it would make sense.

12:16.588 --> 12:18.922
This victim, Lily Rivera,
did she testify?

12:18.924 --> 12:21.040
She broke down under cross,

12:21.042 --> 12:23.126
wouldn't retake the stand.

12:23.128 --> 12:25.077
Look, somebody's taking
these guys out one by one.

12:25.079 --> 12:27.714
This girl... she seem the type
of person who'd be capable?

12:27.716 --> 12:28.965
ERIN:
I hope not.

12:28.967 --> 12:31.134
I mean, it was devastating
enough to lose the case.

12:31.136 --> 12:33.770
It would destroy me if I had
to prosecute her for murder.

12:33.772 --> 12:35.855
Yeah, I mean, last I heard,
she was in rehab.

12:35.857 --> 12:38.958
I mean, she's never
really recovered from this.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.449
Lily, we're very sorry
for all you've been through.

12:46.451 --> 12:47.951
We'll try to make
this brief, okay?

12:47.953 --> 12:50.653
Now, when was the last time
you saw or heard from

12:50.655 --> 12:52.122
any of the men
accused of raping you?

12:52.124 --> 12:54.324
Accused of raping me?

12:55.392 --> 12:56.776
What does that mean?

12:56.778 --> 12:58.178
You think that they're innocent?

12:58.180 --> 13:00.547
No, that's not what I meant.

13:01.382 --> 13:03.616
Right.

13:03.618 --> 13:05.585
The last time I saw them was...

13:05.587 --> 13:06.920
a month ago.

13:06.922 --> 13:08.488
After the trial ended,

13:08.490 --> 13:10.807
and they were celebrating.

13:10.809 --> 13:13.125
High-fiving each other and
slapping each other on the back

13:13.127 --> 13:14.561
when they won the case.

13:14.563 --> 13:16.896
I'm sorry.

13:16.898 --> 13:19.315
Detective Freehill
promised that...

13:19.317 --> 13:22.468
that there was no way these guys
were ever gonna walk.

13:22.470 --> 13:25.321
So that must have been
very upsetting for you, huh?

13:25.323 --> 13:27.857
Upsetting?

13:27.859 --> 13:29.659
They tell me

13:29.661 --> 13:31.361
that I have...

13:31.363 --> 13:34.614
some sort of post-traumatic
stress disorder.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.819
I thought only soldiers
coming back from war got that.

13:39.821 --> 13:41.855
You know why I'm here?

13:41.857 --> 13:43.256
'Cause all the drugs

13:43.258 --> 13:46.259
that they prescribed...

13:46.261 --> 13:49.429
didn't make me functional again.

13:49.431 --> 13:53.216
They just gave me this whole
other set of nightmares.

13:53.218 --> 13:57.053
Lily, we have
to ask you this. Okay?

13:57.055 --> 13:59.138
Where were you this morning
between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m.?

13:59.140 --> 14:02.108
My mom checked me in last night.

14:02.110 --> 14:04.277
I haven't left.

14:05.563 --> 14:06.729
Why?

14:06.731 --> 14:09.332
(sighs)

14:09.334 --> 14:12.202
Why? Because two of
the men who raped you

14:12.204 --> 14:13.620
have turned up dead.

14:13.622 --> 14:17.189
John Ramos was killed
a week ago,

14:17.191 --> 14:18.925
Eduardo Munoz was
killed this morning.

14:18.927 --> 14:21.628
(sighs)

14:21.630 --> 14:23.796
Can you get me on that list?

14:23.798 --> 14:25.582
(crying):
Because I...

14:25.584 --> 14:29.419
honestly wish
someone would kill me.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.389
(sobs)

14:49.323 --> 14:51.875
And... smile.

14:52.944 --> 14:54.294
And now a handshake.

14:58.916 --> 15:01.301
I think we got it.
Thank you, John.

15:01.303 --> 15:03.553
Could you stop down at 13
and just download those now?

15:03.555 --> 15:05.672
Give us a minute, Garrett.

15:05.674 --> 15:07.641
Commissioner?

15:07.643 --> 15:09.009
Give us a minute.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.600
Why do you think you
won this essay contest?

15:17.618 --> 15:20.070
I just write what I think
people want to hear.

15:21.939 --> 15:23.723
Tell me about your family.

15:23.725 --> 15:24.691
Your dad?

15:24.693 --> 15:26.526
I don't know my dad.

15:28.529 --> 15:30.163
Okay.

15:34.502 --> 15:36.069
(sighs)

15:36.071 --> 15:37.287
Tell me about your mother.

15:37.289 --> 15:39.756
What do you know about my mom?

15:41.626 --> 15:43.777
I know she was murdered,

15:43.779 --> 15:45.845
and I know the case
is still open.

15:45.847 --> 15:47.130
You know why?

15:47.132 --> 15:49.666
'Cause of who she was.

15:49.668 --> 15:51.584
Where we're from.

15:53.187 --> 15:55.221
What if it was your wife
who was killed?

15:55.223 --> 15:56.573
Hmm?

15:56.575 --> 15:58.358
How fast would
that case get closed?

15:58.360 --> 16:00.026
It got closed pretty quick.

16:00.028 --> 16:01.444
She died of cancer.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.032
A'ight. Sorry.

16:10.154 --> 16:11.988
The police aren't
the enemy, here.

16:11.990 --> 16:13.657
You know it's been over a year,

16:13.659 --> 16:16.626
and I still don't know
who killed her?

16:16.628 --> 16:19.713
You know no one's
even been charged yet?

16:19.715 --> 16:21.965
And when I ask
the detective why,

16:21.967 --> 16:24.050
he blows me off.

16:24.885 --> 16:27.921
So... you really
going to tell me

16:27.923 --> 16:30.123
if our roles were reversed
it'd be the same?

16:31.993 --> 16:33.510
You really gonna tell me

16:33.512 --> 16:35.812
that we're equal there?

16:36.647 --> 16:39.065
Nope.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.572
(indistinct talking,
phones ringing)

16:48.859 --> 16:50.143
Okay, come with me.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.683
You still have your married name
on the door.

16:56.685 --> 16:57.667
That's a shocker.

16:57.669 --> 16:58.785
(door closes)

16:58.787 --> 17:00.620
It's kind of like
someone on a diet

17:00.622 --> 17:02.655
keeping a fat picture
of themselves on the fridge.

17:02.657 --> 17:05.258
Just to look
at it and go,

17:05.260 --> 17:07.694
"I don't want to
be that person, ever again."

17:07.695 --> 17:08.994
Ah.

17:08.997 --> 17:11.131
What can I do for you?

17:11.133 --> 17:15.518
I, uh, was wondering if you had
any friends who were realtors.

17:16.353 --> 17:17.502
Let me think.

17:17.505 --> 17:18.605
Just about a hundred.

17:18.607 --> 17:20.607
I'm supposed
to look for a place.

17:20.608 --> 17:25.111
And the, uh, the firm
will pay for something nice,

17:25.113 --> 17:26.353
so I thought the commission
might as well...

17:26.354 --> 17:28.760
Tracey Scott.
She's great.

17:29.568 --> 17:30.867
Happily married, though.

17:30.869 --> 17:33.236
I am looking for an apartment.

17:33.238 --> 17:36.689
And, Jack, if you do
end up moving back...

17:36.691 --> 17:38.191
Um, it's just in the air
at this point.

17:38.193 --> 17:40.210
The New York office is way off
on revenue targets...

17:40.212 --> 17:41.377
Whatever.

17:41.379 --> 17:44.047
Can I just ask this?

17:45.533 --> 17:47.801
At least 20 blocks from me.

17:47.803 --> 17:49.368
Different subway stop,

17:49.370 --> 17:52.205
dry cleaners, different...
Chinese takeout.

17:52.207 --> 17:54.674
Different anything where you and
I might bump into each other.

17:54.676 --> 17:56.876
Of course.
And...

17:56.878 --> 17:59.379
can you not put it
in Nicky's head

17:59.381 --> 18:01.431
that you might move back?

18:01.433 --> 18:02.812
I mentioned that there
was a possibility...

18:02.837 --> 18:03.400
Yeah, I know.

18:03.401 --> 18:05.268
I know. Please stop.

18:05.270 --> 18:08.221
Unless and until
it's real,

18:08.223 --> 18:09.656
and you're able to tell her

18:09.658 --> 18:11.724
you're going to see her
more often, and you're sure

18:11.726 --> 18:14.861
that you're actually going
to follow through on it.

18:14.863 --> 18:16.395
Why are you doing this?

18:16.397 --> 18:18.397
Because, Jack, it
would be really cruel

18:18.399 --> 18:20.667
if she thought her father
was living a cab ride away,

18:20.669 --> 18:22.569
and he still didn't
have time for her.

18:22.571 --> 18:24.403
I wouldn't do that to her.

18:26.874 --> 18:28.758
She turns 16 on Sunday.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.293
Do you know what that means?

18:30.295 --> 18:32.629
Yeah, that she's, uh...

18:32.631 --> 18:33.930
I don't know.

18:33.932 --> 18:35.131
She's not a
kid anymore.

18:35.133 --> 18:36.633
And in two years,

18:36.635 --> 18:38.017
it's going to be
totally up to her

18:38.019 --> 18:39.435
which one of us she lives with,

18:39.437 --> 18:41.971
or how often she wants
to see either of us.

18:41.973 --> 18:44.357
So if you do want
to see her more,

18:44.359 --> 18:46.109
run it by her.

18:46.111 --> 18:47.610
Not me.

18:47.612 --> 18:50.263
Fair enough.

18:50.265 --> 18:52.148
Erin Boyle.

18:53.434 --> 18:55.618
Did you ever think that maybe

18:55.620 --> 18:57.654
the real reason you kept
your name on that door

18:57.656 --> 18:59.405
is because for
a long stretch there

18:59.407 --> 19:01.207
we were a pretty good team?

19:02.977 --> 19:05.378
I'll see you in court,
as they say.

19:09.884 --> 19:12.085
(door closes)

19:14.004 --> 19:15.922
DANNY: I think it's the worst
part of the job.

19:15.924 --> 19:18.842
Still can't believe we gotta
protect a bunch of rapists.

19:18.844 --> 19:20.560
Well, they didn't get convicted.

19:20.562 --> 19:22.312
They didn't get convicted
because of a technicality.

19:22.314 --> 19:24.764
I still can't believe they
found a lawyer smart enough

19:24.766 --> 19:26.432
to poke a hole in
the DNA evidence.

19:26.434 --> 19:28.801
If you ask me, they're
getting what they deserve.

19:28.803 --> 19:30.687
What, are we
judge and jury now?

19:30.689 --> 19:31.988
I'm just saying,
I'm not gonna feel good about

19:31.990 --> 19:33.439
locking up the guy
who's doing this to them.

19:33.441 --> 19:36.276
I know. You just feel good
about doing your job.

19:36.278 --> 19:39.863
When you do your job, that's the
difference between us and them.

19:41.415 --> 19:43.082
Hold on,
is that Cabrera?

19:43.084 --> 19:44.584
I think that's our guy, Jack.

19:46.153 --> 19:48.254
Let's go.

19:52.343 --> 19:54.544
Martin Cabrera.

19:56.797 --> 19:58.497
We need to ask you
a few questions.

20:00.251 --> 20:01.150
Hey!

20:01.152 --> 20:02.802
MAN: Run, man!
DANNY: Hey!

20:02.804 --> 20:03.937
Hold on!

20:07.274 --> 20:08.841
DANNY:
Stop that bus!

20:13.113 --> 20:15.565
Hold it!

20:15.567 --> 20:17.016
Stop the bus!

20:17.018 --> 20:18.618
Right now.

20:21.939 --> 20:24.073
Keep the door closed behind me.

20:24.075 --> 20:25.642
Everyone stay in your seats.

20:25.644 --> 20:27.860
It's police business.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.340
You two, come on.

20:46.263 --> 20:48.231
Chill, man. I didn't
even do nothing!

20:48.233 --> 20:49.232
Shut your mouth.

20:49.234 --> 20:50.400
What the hell'd
you run for, huh?

20:50.402 --> 20:51.968
I didn't know you
was a real cop.

20:51.970 --> 20:53.403
I thought you were
gonna kill me.

20:53.405 --> 20:54.604
I thought I was next.

20:54.606 --> 20:55.939
Nine millimeter.

20:55.941 --> 20:57.824
(handcuffs clicking)
Tour's over for you, kid.

20:57.826 --> 21:00.226
Next stop's Rikers Island.

21:00.228 --> 21:02.195
Let's go.

21:02.197 --> 21:03.446
(cheering)
All right, all right.

21:03.448 --> 21:05.064
Thank you.

21:15.987 --> 21:16.438
Come on.

21:16.439 --> 21:18.139
You and I both know
what you did.

21:18.141 --> 21:19.907
I didn't rape her.
Oh, you didn't?

21:19.909 --> 21:21.592
Okay, well, let's
say you didn't.

21:21.594 --> 21:23.694
We still got you on possession
of an illegal firearm...

21:23.696 --> 21:25.479
oh, and resisting arrest,
which, with your record,

21:25.481 --> 21:27.448
I think is good for about
three to six for you.

21:27.450 --> 21:28.950
Shut up, man.

21:28.952 --> 21:30.535
Ain't nobody gonna
punk me, all right?

21:30.537 --> 21:31.586
Really?

21:31.588 --> 21:33.037
Yeah? Know who's
going to punk you?

21:33.039 --> 21:34.655
A bunch of prison inmates
are going to punk you.

21:34.657 --> 21:37.175
I'm gonna skate this, same
as I skated on the last one.

21:37.177 --> 21:39.677
No, you're gonna be someone's
prison bitch, you rapist.

21:42.497 --> 21:43.714
"Fury," huh?

21:43.716 --> 21:45.332
When did you get that tat?

21:45.334 --> 21:47.668
A couple of months ago.
For what?

21:47.670 --> 21:50.688
Some kind of, uh,
gang initiation?

21:50.690 --> 21:52.807
You know, Munoz
had the same one.

21:52.809 --> 21:56.360
Did you both get it
for raping Lily Rivera?

21:56.362 --> 21:58.563
Yeah, maybe I did, so what?

21:58.565 --> 22:00.031
There's nothing you
could do about it.

22:00.866 --> 22:03.367
I'm sorry, I slipped.

22:03.369 --> 22:04.786
Keep your man in check,
all right?

22:04.788 --> 22:05.903
Guy's crazy!

22:05.905 --> 22:07.038
Yes, he is.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.239
Munoz is dead.

22:08.241 --> 22:09.690
Ramos is dead.

22:09.692 --> 22:11.909
All that's left
is you and Turkel.

22:11.911 --> 22:14.528
Last time I saw Turk,

22:14.530 --> 22:16.831
he was freaked out
about the murders.

22:16.833 --> 22:17.882
Where did you see him?

22:17.884 --> 22:20.001
Write it down.

22:20.003 --> 22:21.385
Write it down.

22:21.387 --> 22:25.256
He's staying
at his grandma's house.

22:27.926 --> 22:30.728
So, who do you think did it?

22:33.599 --> 22:37.685
When we got off,
her brother went nutso on us.

22:38.904 --> 22:40.521
Screaming in the courtroom,

22:40.523 --> 22:43.441
saying he was gonna kill us,
one by one.

22:43.443 --> 22:46.210
Too bad he didn't start
with you first.

22:49.531 --> 22:51.415
Lily's seven years
younger than me.

22:51.417 --> 22:55.203
So my whole life, it was,
"Mark, walk Lily to school.

22:55.205 --> 22:57.038
"Mark, take care of Lily.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.123
Mark, help Lily
with homework"

22:59.125 --> 23:02.343
That night, she was going to
a party at a friend's house.

23:02.345 --> 23:04.428
I said I'd meet her
and walk her home,

23:04.430 --> 23:06.297
but she says she's 18.

23:06.299 --> 23:08.516
"I can walk home by myself""

23:08.518 --> 23:12.019
Now she sits inside all day,

23:12.021 --> 23:14.138
watching TV.

23:14.140 --> 23:16.090
I'm watching my
sister waste away.

23:16.092 --> 23:17.475
It's my fault.

23:17.477 --> 23:19.110
Did you try to help her
by getting revenge

23:19.112 --> 23:20.594
on the guys
who did this to her?

23:20.596 --> 23:22.647
I read about the murders.

23:23.782 --> 23:25.149
What, you think I did it?

23:25.151 --> 23:26.450
Put it to you this way,

23:26.452 --> 23:27.818
I wouldn't blame you if you did.

23:27.820 --> 23:29.537
JACKIE:
Martin Cabrera

23:29.539 --> 23:31.572
said you threatened to kill him
and the others

23:31.574 --> 23:32.823
when they were acquitted.

23:32.825 --> 23:34.375
Yeah, I did.

23:34.377 --> 23:36.878
If it was your sister,
wouldn't you?

23:36.880 --> 23:39.497
It doesn't mean I acted on it.
All right,

23:39.499 --> 23:41.799
where were you this morning
between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.?

23:42.751 --> 23:46.287
I stayed the night
at my girl's house.

23:46.289 --> 23:48.890
I didn't leave
for work till 8:00.

23:48.892 --> 23:51.475
She'll corroborate that for you?

23:51.477 --> 23:54.132
Yeah.
Okay.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.064
My sister's rapists
got away scot-free

23:56.065 --> 23:57.932
and now the person
taking revenge on them

23:57.934 --> 24:00.017
is probably gonna
end up in prison.

24:00.019 --> 24:03.120
What kind of justice is that?

24:08.944 --> 24:11.162
What do you think?

24:13.749 --> 24:16.650
It's a little Jodie Foster
in <i>Taxi Driver.</i>

24:16.652 --> 24:17.651
What?

24:17.653 --> 24:19.003
Before your time.

24:19.005 --> 24:20.288
Uh...

24:20.290 --> 24:22.306
Let's try this one.

24:24.710 --> 24:26.460
But I like this one.

24:26.462 --> 24:28.846
Just try it.

24:30.933 --> 24:34.969
So Dad got tickets to <i>Once,</i>
the Saturday matinee.

24:34.971 --> 24:37.504
We're going to an
early dinner after.

24:37.506 --> 24:38.773
Okay.

24:38.775 --> 24:40.507
Then to the Yankees game.

24:40.509 --> 24:43.444
Oh, he's really pouring it on.

24:43.446 --> 24:45.846
Dad got a third
ticket for the game.

24:45.848 --> 24:48.366
Oh, honey, I can't.

24:48.368 --> 24:51.535
And please don't get it
into your head

24:51.537 --> 24:54.405
that if the geography may change

24:54.407 --> 24:56.490
that Dad and I might
get back together.

24:56.492 --> 24:57.742
Mom.
It's just...

24:57.744 --> 24:59.327
it's never gonna happen and...

24:59.329 --> 25:01.362
What I was going to ask...

25:01.364 --> 25:02.797
Going to ask?

25:02.799 --> 25:08.552
Well, I've kind of started
hanging out with Luke Ryder.

25:08.554 --> 25:10.588
Oh.

25:10.590 --> 25:12.556
He's a huge Yankees fan.

25:12.558 --> 25:13.774
Do you think

25:13.776 --> 25:15.559
it'd be cool
if I asked him to go?

25:15.561 --> 25:17.895
Luke Ryder?

25:17.897 --> 25:20.598
Or too, you know, forward?

25:20.600 --> 25:23.934
What did your dad say?

25:23.936 --> 25:24.885
I didn't ask him,

25:24.887 --> 25:26.704
but he said it
was my ticket

25:26.706 --> 25:27.989
to ask whoever I wanted.

25:27.991 --> 25:30.691
Then...

25:32.060 --> 25:36.280
...you should ask who...
whoever you want.

25:36.282 --> 25:37.948
Make sure that Luke Ryder

25:37.950 --> 25:40.785
offers to buy a round
of hot dogs.

25:40.787 --> 25:43.037
(chuckles)

25:44.873 --> 25:47.074
So...

25:47.076 --> 25:48.592
what do you think?

25:48.594 --> 25:50.411
I think

25:50.413 --> 25:55.099
that my little girl
is all grown up.

25:55.101 --> 25:57.251
I meant about the dress.

25:59.388 --> 26:01.539
It's a keeper.

26:04.393 --> 26:06.927
(exhales)
What do you got, partner?

26:06.929 --> 26:08.562
Cabrera's gun wasn't a match,

26:08.564 --> 26:10.764
and the brother's alibi
checked out.

26:10.766 --> 26:12.783
Well, it's got
to be somebody close to her.

26:12.785 --> 26:14.902
How about the father?
Deceased.

26:14.904 --> 26:16.153
Okay, what about the mother?

26:16.155 --> 26:18.906
No, she works
the night shift at Jacobi,

26:18.908 --> 26:20.791
and they said
she was there last night.

26:20.793 --> 26:22.793
Great.

26:22.795 --> 26:24.245
Excuse me, Detective.
What's this?

26:24.247 --> 26:26.580
Looks like we got
a ballistics hit.

26:26.582 --> 26:28.632
Bullets from the
murders match ones found

26:28.634 --> 26:31.052
in a gang shooting
in the Bronx two years ago.

26:31.054 --> 26:33.337
Shooter was named Paco Flores.

26:33.339 --> 26:35.673
Let's go see Paco.

26:35.675 --> 26:38.592
(dog barking in distance)

26:42.347 --> 26:44.465
You left this
in the kitchen.

26:46.101 --> 26:49.520
Why are you looking
into a murder in East New York?

26:49.522 --> 26:52.022
You're reading my files.

26:52.024 --> 26:53.324
Well, I'm retired.

26:53.326 --> 26:56.360
What else do I have to do?

26:57.946 --> 26:59.413
What's bothering you?

26:59.415 --> 27:00.647
Nothing, Pop.

27:00.649 --> 27:02.316
(chuckles)

27:02.318 --> 27:04.118
I forget where I left my keys,

27:04.120 --> 27:07.004
and sometimes I don't remember
my grocery list,

27:07.006 --> 27:09.790
but one thing I haven't lost,

27:09.792 --> 27:13.544
and that is my ability to know
when something is bothering you.

27:15.430 --> 27:17.181
(sighs)

27:17.183 --> 27:18.632
My Commissioner for the Day,

27:18.634 --> 27:20.351
it's his mother
that was murdered.

27:20.353 --> 27:23.554
There's something
he doesn't know.

27:23.556 --> 27:26.173
And when he finds out,

27:26.175 --> 27:28.692
it's gonna hurt him.

27:28.694 --> 27:31.845
So what are you gonna tell him?

27:31.847 --> 27:33.697
The truth.

27:33.699 --> 27:36.233
(sighs)

27:36.235 --> 27:39.870
What do you remember
about your grandfather?

27:39.872 --> 27:42.289
Grandpa?

27:43.525 --> 27:45.993
He taught me how to fish.

27:45.995 --> 27:48.529
Taught me how to throw
a curveball.

27:48.531 --> 27:51.715
He was a useless drunk.

27:51.717 --> 27:53.918
When I was growing up,

27:53.920 --> 27:56.220
my father went from job to job

27:56.222 --> 27:58.639
because he was always drinking.

27:58.641 --> 28:02.510
My mother had to
work her butt off

28:02.512 --> 28:05.212
to pay for us to go
to Catholic school.

28:05.214 --> 28:07.348
He left when I was 15.

28:07.350 --> 28:11.652
I had to get a job
to help Mom pay the bills.

28:11.654 --> 28:15.606
Then when he came back,
years later,

28:15.608 --> 28:18.526
it was never the same for me.

28:20.895 --> 28:23.047
I had no respect for him.

28:23.898 --> 28:26.233
You loved Grandpa.

28:26.235 --> 28:29.236
Of course I did, Francis,

28:29.238 --> 28:31.956
because he was my father.

28:31.958 --> 28:34.425
You loved your granddad

28:34.427 --> 28:36.861
because you didn't know
the history.

28:41.266 --> 28:43.300
You never told me.

28:43.302 --> 28:45.186
(groans)

28:45.188 --> 28:48.856
It would have ruined
your relationship

28:48.858 --> 28:52.926
and whatever wonderful memories
you had with him.

28:55.113 --> 28:57.248
I like this kid.

28:59.985 --> 29:02.036
(clears throat)
Seems to me like

29:02.038 --> 29:04.572
all he's got left are memories.

29:09.828 --> 29:12.012
(distant siren wailing)

29:13.248 --> 29:15.449
(muffled talking, dog barking)

29:19.888 --> 29:21.255
Police! Open up!

29:21.257 --> 29:22.456
MAN:
You got a search warrant?

29:22.458 --> 29:24.758
You hear someone
screaming inside?

29:24.760 --> 29:27.645
As if they were in distress
and need our help desperately?

29:27.647 --> 29:30.564
Hmm, yeah, I think we should
probably wait for backup.

29:30.566 --> 29:32.983
Yeah, we'll wait
for backup.

29:32.985 --> 29:35.302
Police! On the floor right now!

29:35.304 --> 29:36.470
Get down on the floor.

29:36.472 --> 29:38.939
You two, on the floor now!
Let's go! Down!

29:38.941 --> 29:40.324
We're not here
for any of you.

29:40.326 --> 29:42.326
We're for Paco, all right.

29:42.328 --> 29:44.144
So don't do anything stupid.

29:44.146 --> 29:47.481
Coming out, Jack.

29:47.483 --> 29:49.533
OFFICER:
All right, stay down there.

29:49.535 --> 29:50.784
Stay down there.

29:50.786 --> 29:52.703
Show me your hands.

29:52.705 --> 29:56.340
On the ground, now!

29:58.043 --> 29:59.593
Okay.

29:59.595 --> 30:00.761
Hello?

30:00.763 --> 30:03.130
Hello, Paco.

30:03.132 --> 30:04.515
Get on your feet.

30:04.517 --> 30:06.350
I said get up.

30:06.352 --> 30:07.685
Now listen to me,

30:07.687 --> 30:08.835
I don't care
what you're doing here.

30:08.837 --> 30:10.271
I don't even care
what you got on you.

30:10.273 --> 30:12.172
I care about a shooting you
were involved in two years ago.

30:12.174 --> 30:13.357
What happened to the gun?

30:13.359 --> 30:14.508
I don't got that gun.

30:14.510 --> 30:16.009
I said what happened to it?

30:16.011 --> 30:17.378
A cop took it, man.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.679
A cop took it?

30:18.681 --> 30:20.614
Was it... a detective?

30:20.616 --> 30:22.866
Yeah.
It wasn't listed as evidence.

30:22.868 --> 30:24.201
What was his name?

30:24.203 --> 30:26.987
Uh, Free something.

30:27.822 --> 30:30.157
Detective Freehill?

30:30.159 --> 30:31.492
Yeah, that's it, Freehill.

30:31.494 --> 30:33.043
Detective Freehill.

30:33.045 --> 30:35.379
Okay, come on.

30:35.381 --> 30:36.580
Get out of here.

30:37.666 --> 30:40.334
Jack, Detective
Freehill is the guy

30:40.336 --> 30:41.702
that worked Lily Rivera's case.

30:41.704 --> 30:44.037
I met him this morning
in Erin's office.

30:44.039 --> 30:46.173
You saying a cop murdered
these guys?

30:46.175 --> 30:47.725
It makes sense now.

30:47.727 --> 30:50.711
Well, if that's the case,
Turkel is next.

30:50.713 --> 30:52.062
And we have
an address on him

30:52.064 --> 30:54.231
that's close by; you want to check it out?
No, no, no.

30:54.233 --> 30:56.400
You put a team together, you
go find Freehill, all right?

30:56.402 --> 30:58.569
I'm gonna go by Turkel's place.

31:14.202 --> 31:16.236
Jack,

31:16.238 --> 31:19.072
it looks like Freehill
might be here already.

31:19.074 --> 31:20.574
Yeah, call in an 85
to this address.

31:20.576 --> 31:22.209
Yeah, I'll wait for backup.

31:24.512 --> 31:27.881
(indistinct shouting,
distant clattering)

31:27.883 --> 31:29.767
MAN:
Please, please, man.

31:29.769 --> 31:31.969
(man continues indistinctly)

31:34.105 --> 31:36.306
MAN: Come on, please.
Come on, man.

31:36.308 --> 31:38.275
(crying)
Please, come on.

31:38.277 --> 31:40.093
No! Please don't!

31:40.095 --> 31:42.946
Don't do this to me, man!
Oh, come on!

31:42.948 --> 31:44.948
(crying)

31:44.950 --> 31:46.433
(crying)

31:46.435 --> 31:48.318
Police!
Please! Please help me!

31:48.320 --> 31:49.286
Drop it!

31:49.288 --> 31:51.288
Stay out! Stay out!

31:51.290 --> 31:52.706
I said drop that gun!

31:52.708 --> 31:54.708
Come on!
I'm telling you, stay out!

31:54.710 --> 31:56.577
Stay out of here!

32:04.174 --> 32:07.304
I don't want to die, man!
Shut up!

32:07.504 --> 32:08.954
Detective Freehill,

32:08.956 --> 32:10.405
I want you to put
that gun down right now.

32:10.407 --> 32:11.840
I promised her
I'd get justice.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.409
I promised her that they would
never be able to hurt her again,

32:14.411 --> 32:15.710
and they walked
out of there free,

32:15.712 --> 32:17.345
like it was all a big joke.
I know what they did.

32:17.347 --> 32:19.130
I know what they did.
I worked that case for over a year.

32:19.132 --> 32:21.316
Man, I did everything
by the book!

32:21.318 --> 32:22.934
I know,
and it wasn't your fault.

32:22.936 --> 32:24.419
Okay, it happens.

32:24.421 --> 32:25.587
We all get cases
that don't go

32:25.589 --> 32:26.721
the way we want,
that don't go

32:26.723 --> 32:27.689
the way they should, okay?

32:27.691 --> 32:29.441
No, they never, never,
never once

32:29.443 --> 32:31.026
showed an ounce of remorse,

32:31.028 --> 32:32.344
and they can't be retried.

32:32.346 --> 32:33.878
They're gonna walk away
scot-free

32:33.880 --> 32:36.147
on my case? On my time?

32:36.149 --> 32:37.204
I can't let this guy walk.

32:37.229 --> 32:39.044
You're gonna do this
scumbag's time for him, huh?

32:39.436 --> 32:40.266
Is that what you're gonna do?

32:40.291 --> 32:41.937
What sense does that make?
Tell you what sense it makes,

32:41.938 --> 32:43.872
at least she gets justice,
that's what sense it makes.

32:43.874 --> 32:46.908
You know the type of girl she is, Pete.
She's only gonna blame herself.

32:46.910 --> 32:48.743
Look at me.

32:48.745 --> 32:51.046
Don't take the coward's way out
on this, all right?

32:51.048 --> 32:53.198
I don't know you well,
but I know you well enough

32:53.200 --> 32:55.517
to know you're not a coward, all
right? You're a good detective.

32:55.519 --> 32:56.885
Do me a favor.

32:56.887 --> 32:59.754
Lower that gun
so we can talk here. Come on.

33:02.174 --> 33:04.426
What happens? This guy just gets
to walk out of here?

33:04.428 --> 33:06.428
Come on. You and I both
know scumbags like this.

33:06.430 --> 33:08.229
He will make another
mistake again,

33:08.231 --> 33:11.149
and when he does,
Pete, I will be there.

33:11.151 --> 33:14.603
One cop to another, I give you
my word, I will get him.

33:14.605 --> 33:16.521
(sirens approach)

33:17.940 --> 33:19.691
That's some of our guys
out there now.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.076
What are you gonna do?

33:21.078 --> 33:23.495
It's only gonna get more
complicated for you. Look at me.

33:23.497 --> 33:25.714
Give it up, Pete.
Come on.

33:25.716 --> 33:26.998
Give me that.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.650
(Turkel sobbing)

33:32.338 --> 33:34.456
Come on.

33:36.492 --> 33:37.592
There you go.

33:37.594 --> 33:39.878
Now step back.

33:41.764 --> 33:44.099
(indistinct radio transmission)

33:44.101 --> 33:45.383
(siren wails briefly)

33:45.385 --> 33:47.602
That was fun.

33:47.604 --> 33:49.671
Sure.

33:51.190 --> 33:53.241
Well, he's looking at 25 to life.
Yeah.

33:53.243 --> 33:55.927
Maybe he'll get
a good lawyer and walk.

33:55.929 --> 33:57.362
I don't know.

33:57.364 --> 33:58.697
You know, call me crazy,

33:58.699 --> 34:00.865
but me and that guy aren't
that different

34:00.867 --> 34:02.117
if you think about it.

34:02.119 --> 34:04.519
What are you talking about?

34:04.521 --> 34:06.788
Just saying, similar situation,

34:06.790 --> 34:08.706
at least with someone
I care about,

34:08.708 --> 34:11.993
I might have done
the same thing he did.

34:18.884 --> 34:20.585
What did you say to him
in there?

34:20.587 --> 34:22.971
A bunch of lies.
What I wanted to tell him

34:22.973 --> 34:25.039
was go ahead and shoot
the son of a bitch

34:25.041 --> 34:26.424
and let's be done with it.

34:26.426 --> 34:30.895
ERIN: <i>The issue here is not</i>
<i>who gave consent.</i>

34:30.897 --> 34:33.648
The officers had consent.
The question is did they have

34:33.650 --> 34:35.934
the right to stop Mr. Powell
and probable cause

34:35.936 --> 34:39.387
to search him, which led
to the ten ounces of heroin.

34:39.389 --> 34:41.156
BOYLE: Right. And where was
the probable cause?

34:41.158 --> 34:43.074
Is it now a crime
to do your laundry?

34:43.076 --> 34:44.775
Because that's where Mr. Powell
was headed when he was stopped.

34:44.777 --> 34:48.163
Really? Does he always bring
ten ounces of heroin separated

34:48.165 --> 34:50.782
into ten glassine envelopes
to do laundry?

34:50.784 --> 34:52.867
Your Honor, a citizen has
the expectation

34:52.869 --> 34:55.335
of privacy inside his own home.

34:55.338 --> 34:57.071
The building owners
and its residents

34:57.072 --> 34:58.807
have an expectation
for safety and...

34:58.809 --> 35:00.208
I will review the motion.

35:00.210 --> 35:02.460
We will reconvene at 2:00 p.m.

35:02.462 --> 35:04.462
(gavel bangs)

35:24.433 --> 35:25.683
Commissioner.

35:25.685 --> 35:27.068
You got a minute?

35:29.438 --> 35:32.540
I took a look
at your mom's case.

35:36.028 --> 35:37.278
We've always had a suspect.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.197
We're just looking
for a key witness.

35:39.199 --> 35:40.832
Who?

35:40.834 --> 35:43.635
For now, you just need to know
that your mom was caught

35:43.637 --> 35:45.420
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

35:45.422 --> 35:48.223
You're lying.

35:48.225 --> 35:49.724
I didn't lie.

35:49.726 --> 35:53.228
I just didn't tell
the whole truth.

35:53.230 --> 35:56.964
Yeah, well, whatever
you want to call it, all right,

35:56.966 --> 35:59.050
but that "wrong place,
wrong time""

35:59.052 --> 36:00.435
that's all bull, all right?

36:00.437 --> 36:03.971
I'm 18.
I don't want the BS version.

36:05.624 --> 36:09.994
Your mom was shot point-blank
by a rival drug dealer

36:09.996 --> 36:12.781
who thought she was moving in
on his territory.

36:15.084 --> 36:17.051
My mom was selling drugs?

36:17.053 --> 36:18.820
Crack cocaine.

36:27.596 --> 36:28.847
She was a bartender.

36:28.849 --> 36:31.466
I-I never even saw her
with drugs.

36:31.468 --> 36:34.269
She was selling
from behind the bar.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.105
And the detective
on the case

36:37.107 --> 36:38.473
did not blow you off.

36:38.475 --> 36:41.559
It was stalled because the only
witness to her murder

36:41.561 --> 36:42.861
disappeared that night.

36:42.863 --> 36:43.978
So what you saying then,

36:43.980 --> 36:46.180
whoever did it is just
gonna get away with it?

36:46.182 --> 36:48.015
Not if I can help it.

36:48.017 --> 36:51.069
And now you feel sorry for me.

36:51.071 --> 36:53.905
Um, I'm not a charity case.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.023
Don't confuse me
with social services.

36:56.025 --> 36:57.659
I'm not your counselor.

36:57.661 --> 36:59.644
I didn't come here
to hold your hand.

36:59.646 --> 37:01.963
So what did you come for, huh?!

37:01.965 --> 37:04.916
To tell me that my mom's been
lying to me for years?

37:04.918 --> 37:06.701
You didn't even
know who I was.

37:06.703 --> 37:08.469
You didn't even care
about any of this

37:08.471 --> 37:09.971
until I came into your office.

37:09.973 --> 37:12.407
You need to get your head out
of your ass.

37:12.409 --> 37:14.876
Who do you think chose you,
Jordan?

37:19.214 --> 37:22.684
"I can't compete with kids my
age who have money and status

37:22.686 --> 37:27.772
"to help them succeed, but I can
compete on sheer will

37:27.774 --> 37:30.692
"and determination
because that can't be bought,

37:30.694 --> 37:34.696
"can't be handed down,
and its supply is endless

37:34.698 --> 37:38.566
if you decide, like me,
never to give up."

37:43.005 --> 37:45.740
I told you I write what
people like to hear.

37:45.742 --> 37:47.842
Oh, yeah, that's right.

37:50.095 --> 37:51.512
(sighs)

37:51.514 --> 37:54.649
No question you've got every
reason to be bitter and angry.

37:54.651 --> 37:58.019
You got
a legitimate grievance.

37:58.021 --> 37:59.604
Now, you can nurse
that grievance

37:59.606 --> 38:02.307
and become a victim
for the rest of your life

38:02.309 --> 38:04.058
or you can choose to persevere.

38:05.811 --> 38:07.528
I'm not a victim.

38:08.981 --> 38:11.032
No, you're not.

38:12.668 --> 38:15.320
You can be somebody.

38:15.322 --> 38:18.456
'Cause I won some
stupid essay contest?

38:18.458 --> 38:23.044
Because you convinced the police
commissioner of New York City

38:23.046 --> 38:25.279
to reexamine your mom's murder.

38:26.332 --> 38:28.282
So, if you find out
something else

38:28.284 --> 38:29.751
about my mom's case, then...

38:29.753 --> 38:32.086
You're my first phone call.

38:33.889 --> 38:35.540
Right.

38:35.542 --> 38:37.008
Okay.

38:39.294 --> 38:41.763
You want to
practice shooting,

38:41.765 --> 38:44.349
you ought to run a bunch
of wind sprints first.

38:44.351 --> 38:46.184
That way you're
shooting through fatigue.

38:46.186 --> 38:47.902
More like the real thing.

38:50.489 --> 38:51.973
Thanks.

38:51.975 --> 38:55.026
You're welcome.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.705
Turn it up.

39:07.707 --> 39:09.674
(pop music playing)

39:20.386 --> 39:22.003
Hi, I'm Erin,
Nicky's mom.

39:22.005 --> 39:23.671
Nice to meet you. Luke Ryder.

39:23.673 --> 39:26.090
Oh, well, Luke Ryder.

39:26.092 --> 39:28.843
Yeah.

39:28.845 --> 39:30.144
Is-Is Nicky here yet?

39:30.146 --> 39:33.481
Yeah, yeah, she's right
over there with the gang.

39:46.712 --> 39:49.497
Who's that kid
with Nicky?

39:52.167 --> 39:53.968
Ah, that's her friend.

39:53.970 --> 39:56.471
These are really good.
You know, you should try some.

39:56.473 --> 39:58.840
Like a friend friend
or a boyfriend friend?

39:58.842 --> 40:00.308
Why don't you ask her?

40:00.310 --> 40:02.643
Poor kid.
Why?

40:02.645 --> 40:05.313
Imagine you looking over at
this table, what do you see?

40:05.315 --> 40:06.314
You see New York's Finest

40:06.316 --> 40:07.815
eating a bunch
of finger foods.

40:07.817 --> 40:09.370
Yeah, and watching for him
to make one false move.

40:09.395 --> 40:10.152
That's right.

40:10.153 --> 40:12.437
How much do we know
about this kid, huh?

40:12.439 --> 40:14.956
Don't worry, Pop,
I'm already on top of it.

40:14.958 --> 40:16.357
(chuckles)

40:19.778 --> 40:21.512
Hi.

40:21.514 --> 40:23.064
Oh, hi.

40:23.066 --> 40:25.950
Uh, Nicky invited me.

40:25.952 --> 40:27.952
Yeah, I know.
I figured if you

40:27.954 --> 40:30.237
wanted me not to come,
I would've heard from you.

40:30.239 --> 40:32.523
It's her party.

40:32.525 --> 40:35.927
I will take that as a...

40:35.929 --> 40:38.429
Recusal?
...recusal.

40:38.431 --> 40:41.132
Oh, and congratulations
on the ruling, by the way.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.917
Thank you.

40:42.919 --> 40:44.418
Please don't get mad at me,

40:44.420 --> 40:47.522
but you look absolutely
beautiful, Ms. Boyle.

40:47.524 --> 40:51.008
Oh, don't call me that.

40:51.010 --> 40:52.360
Beautiful or Boyle?

40:52.362 --> 40:53.878
Neither.

40:55.898 --> 40:59.067
Uh, go say hi to my family.

41:02.071 --> 41:03.237
They packing?

41:03.239 --> 41:05.406
(chuckles) Go.

41:07.275 --> 41:09.460
Jack...

41:09.462 --> 41:12.279
It's good that you're here.

41:22.457 --> 41:23.758
Uncle Jack!

41:23.760 --> 41:25.626
I didn't know you were coming.

41:25.628 --> 41:26.644
How are you?

41:26.646 --> 41:28.513
Oh, Jack, Sean!

41:28.515 --> 41:30.965
Wait, wait, wait.
Hup, hup!

41:30.967 --> 41:32.133
Pick one.

41:33.068 --> 41:34.986
Look at that.

41:34.988 --> 41:36.571
Old silver dollars.

41:36.573 --> 41:38.573
Luck in your pocket.
SEAN: Cool!

41:38.575 --> 41:40.908
JACK: Yeah, cool.
DANNY: Very cool, very cool.

41:40.910 --> 41:44.562
Ah, Jamie, too long.

41:44.564 --> 41:47.331
Good to see you.
You.

41:47.333 --> 41:48.566
Danny, Linda.

41:48.568 --> 41:49.867
Jack, good to see you.

41:49.869 --> 41:50.985
You mean that?

41:50.987 --> 41:52.153
Yeah.

41:52.155 --> 41:53.554
(chuckles)

41:53.556 --> 41:55.373
Keep moving.

41:57.709 --> 42:00.428
Hello, Jack.
Hello, Frank.

42:00.430 --> 42:03.047
I'm, uh, I'm sorry
about that subpoena.

42:03.049 --> 42:04.331
It was nothing personal.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.667
No big deal.
Squashed it like a cockroach.

42:06.669 --> 42:09.503
Uh, yeah, yeah, so you did,
so you did.

42:09.505 --> 42:11.889
So, uh, no hard feelings?

42:11.891 --> 42:14.559
Nah. I figured you'd
suffered enough already.

42:14.561 --> 42:16.644
Uh, yeah? How's that?

42:16.646 --> 42:19.530
You had two of the best women
I've ever known,

42:19.532 --> 42:21.515
and you let 'em both go.

42:40.919 --> 42:43.004
Morning,
Ms. Reagan-Boy...

42:43.006 --> 42:45.256
Ms. Reagan.

42:46.325 --> 42:47.892
Good morning to you.
