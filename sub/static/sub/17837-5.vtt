00:06.307 --> 00:06.474
.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.541
- Previously on "Shooter"...
- He missed.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.611
He killed
the Ukrainian president.

00:10.644 --> 00:11.779
- We can hold a press conference
and we can tell--

00:11.812 --> 00:13.581
- Honey, they will kill you.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.349
They'll kill Mary.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.551
- What about you?
- I'm gonna focus on finding

00:17.585 --> 00:19.220
the actual shooter.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.122
- He knows we were targeting
the Ukrainian.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.490
- So what?

00:27.461 --> 00:29.297
- Congratulations.
We got him.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.099
- Bob Lee faked his death.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.134
He had to to get the cops
and the Feds off his back.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.635
- Did Voydian have
any connection at all

00:34.668 --> 00:36.504
to Bob Lee Swagger?

00:36.537 --> 00:40.108
- Swagger was the lone gunman.
- How much of this is bullshit?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.542
- Can you just let it go?

00:41.575 --> 00:45.379
This alcohol will kill you
very pleasantly.

00:45.413 --> 00:48.449
[grunting and shouting]

00:51.252 --> 00:53.454
- Shoot him!

00:53.487 --> 00:56.257
I need you alive as an asset
inside the government.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.591
So, are we partners?

01:00.328 --> 01:03.364
[heavy breathing]

01:09.503 --> 01:11.439
- [exclaims]
- Sorry. Sorry, baby.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.474
- It's okay.
It's okay.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.544
[moaning and heavy breathing]

01:22.350 --> 01:24.885
- [sighs]

01:24.918 --> 01:26.254
[giggles]

01:27.488 --> 01:30.391
- Did you set up the email?
- Mm-hmm.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.625
Just like you asked.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.194
[groans]

01:33.227 --> 01:35.963
Password's "kittenmouse."

01:40.234 --> 01:43.471
- Baby, I'm so sorry about
all this cloak and dagger stuff.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.439
Involving you,
putting you at risk...

01:45.473 --> 01:46.440
I hate it.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.409
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.712
You don't get to say that.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.248
[whispering]
I'm glad I got to see you.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.688
I am afraid to ask you
what you're gonna do next.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.157
- I'm going back
to where it happened.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.526
- The Science Center?
Why?

02:05.559 --> 02:08.529
- I've got to find the bullet.
- They have the bullet.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.398
- They have
the one they planted.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.366
- You don't think
they have both?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.568
- It was a big area.
There was lots of media

02:14.602 --> 02:17.371
and police and crowds...
it was chaos.

02:17.405 --> 02:20.374
- Don't you think Isaac already
had his people search the area?

02:20.408 --> 02:22.176
- It's a long shot,
but I got to try,

02:22.210 --> 02:23.744
gotta get down there
and reconstruct the shot.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.446
- How?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.248
- The bullet came
from the boathouse.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.482
If the Science Center is
at 12:00,

02:28.516 --> 02:30.351
the Ukrainian president was
struck in the head

02:30.384 --> 02:31.952
around 10:00.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.654
- But a bullet going
through bone and tissue--

02:33.687 --> 02:34.655
it could be anywhere.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.424
- Not anywhere.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.393
The Lapua Magnum is
a 250-grain load.

02:39.427 --> 02:43.397
At 1,580 yards, it would drop
roughly 380 inches

02:43.431 --> 02:46.367
from its initial path.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.602
That means that it was
traveling downward.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.339
With all the mayhem, they may
not have been able to find it.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.973
Anyway, I got to try.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.542
- Just please remember,

02:54.575 --> 02:55.776
you're supposed to be dead.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.246
- I know.
I'll be careful.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.249
[tense music]

03:01.282 --> 03:08.322
*

03:23.737 --> 03:26.707
- How many secret hideouts
do you have?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.776
- It's a secret.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.478
- You're such a shit.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.814
- Baby,

03:33.847 --> 03:36.317
remember where this place is,
but don't write it down.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.751
And never bring your phone.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.388
- You know the world thinks
you're dead, right?

03:40.421 --> 03:43.457
- Yeah, and I want to keep it
that way as long as possible.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.765
- Do you remember
when you were active...

03:51.799 --> 03:56.337
every time you'd deploy, we'd
always say good-bye so casually,

03:56.370 --> 04:00.274
like you were just going
to the store to get ice cream.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.346
I always wondered
if it made a difference.

04:05.379 --> 04:08.449
'Cause whenever you got on
that plane, I'd cry my eyes out.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.288
- It made a difference.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.696
- Okay,

04:22.730 --> 04:24.264
then bye.

04:38.446 --> 04:41.415
[dramatic music]

05:06.340 --> 05:06.640
.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.575
- I need all the Dimitri Voydian
files pulled,

05:09.142 --> 05:10.978
all his last-known associates

05:11.011 --> 05:13.581
and any documented
meeting places.

05:13.614 --> 05:14.882
Okay.
Thanks.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.731
- All right,
let's get back to work.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.335
[phone buzzing]

05:39.773 --> 05:42.410
[dramatic music]

05:42.443 --> 05:44.845
[bell ringing]

05:44.878 --> 05:51.919
*

06:02.930 --> 06:04.432
[knocking on door]

06:04.465 --> 06:06.767
[football playing on TV]

06:06.800 --> 06:08.802
- What's the password?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.671
- You missed Swagger again.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.755
- Help yourself
to some room service.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.891
- How much does Memphis know?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.961
- She's got bits and pieces.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.499
- And now she has me.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.804
- Is there anything
I can help you with, Johnson?

06:43.837 --> 06:45.939
I got work to do.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.174
- What work?

06:47.207 --> 06:49.877
- Sorry. Need to know
and all that.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.783
- I need to know.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.851
- Meachum wants
any loose ends sewn up.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.194
Wet work.
Not for you.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.500
- Need the fluid.
We need those specific parts,

07:12.533 --> 07:14.735
because we've been working
on this for a while.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.836
And that's what you said
last week.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.838
I know.
Yeah.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.240
It's Evan.
Okay. Thank you.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.477
[Evan continues speaking
indistinctly]

07:24.277 --> 07:30.484

07:44.031 --> 07:45.098
[horns honk]

07:45.132 --> 07:46.199
- Yo!
I got to get in there.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.068
Evan said this was a rush job.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.169
Back up.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.183
[lift whirs]

08:12.926 --> 08:19.967
*

08:41.655 --> 08:48.829
*

08:57.971 --> 08:59.339
- Let me call you back.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.874
What are you talking about?

09:00.908 --> 09:03.944
[whirring]

09:06.680 --> 09:13.854
*

09:20.894 --> 09:22.896
Hey!
Hey, you, working on 916.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.598
What are you doing?

09:24.632 --> 09:27.234
- I don't know, man. Looks
like a full brake job to me.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.102
These rotors are shot.
How do they put these things

09:29.136 --> 09:30.270
on the road in this condition?

09:30.303 --> 09:31.905
- Who told you it was
a full brake job?

09:31.939 --> 09:33.941
- The paperwork.
- What paperwork?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.375
Hey, there's nothing on here
that says anything about that.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.611
- The one up front.
The paperwork up front.

09:37.645 --> 09:38.879
Oh, you should see the ones
on this side.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.213
These are a mess.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.682
- Where'd you--
- Check out this front left.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.050
- Where did you come from,
anyway?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.618
- From dispatch.
- Dispatch, huh?

09:44.652 --> 09:45.686
- Yeah. You should see
these ones up front.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.154
They are a mess.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.189
Never had this problem
with the old cruisers.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.958
- I heard nothing
about dispatch. Nothing.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.259
Who are you?

09:52.292 --> 09:54.027
- Oh, you got a Freon leak too.
- Freon leak?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.963
Hey!
Get back here!

09:55.996 --> 09:57.597
Get him.
Hey!

10:02.169 --> 10:03.403
[gunshot]

10:03.436 --> 10:05.639

[gunshot]

10:48.448 --> 10:55.689
*

11:27.387 --> 11:29.356
- What's this?
- That's the bullet that killed

11:29.389 --> 11:31.124
the Ukrainian president.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.194
The real bullet.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.063
- Right, your text from earlier.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.165
Seattle PD cruiser 916.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.502
This bullet looks undamaged.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.104
- Hardened polymer.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.438
I put it
into a steel water tank,

11:45.472 --> 11:47.140
and there's not even a scratch.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.375
That's master armorer work.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.210
And it's illegal.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.413
Got any connections at the ATF?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.315
- [sighs]

11:55.348 --> 11:57.217
I hope this leads somewhere,

11:57.250 --> 11:59.386
'cause it took me three months
to get rid of this guy.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.155
- So you're a heartbreaker?
- [scoffs]

12:05.358 --> 12:12.399
*

12:29.817 --> 12:32.385
That's--that's very sweet.
Thanks.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.455
Of course. Yeah.
As soon as I get in the office.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.026
Okay. Yeah.
Uh-huh.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.828
Hey, you know what--
okay, thanks, David.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.430
Talk soon.
[sighs]

12:43.463 --> 12:46.299
I think I just got engaged.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.069
He says they've just started
tracking bullets like these.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.871
He thinks they're coming
out of a Second Amendment outfit

12:50.904 --> 12:52.139
called The Tree of Liberty,

12:52.172 --> 12:53.206
but there's no proof.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.541
- You got anything on them?

12:54.574 --> 12:57.577
- Militia group.
Ex-military and well armed.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.479
They have a campsite
outside of Spokane.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.414
ATF just started
drone surveillance,

13:01.448 --> 13:03.116
trying to build their case.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.852
But everyone's afraid
of another Waco,

13:04.885 --> 13:06.386
so they keep their distance.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.188
- All right, well, dig up
any information you can.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.556
I got to talk to them.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.424
What's your boy's name?
- David Hall.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.193
- All right, text me his number.
I might need it.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.528
- I mean, I just said there are
drones in that airspace.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.898
- If those bullets are coming
out of there, I need to get in.

13:22.302 --> 13:22.802
.

13:22.836 --> 13:23.603
- Aside from the damage
to the cruiser,

13:25.238 --> 13:26.874
I couldn't figure out what he
was digging into.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.308
- All right.
Well, you did the right thing.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.877
I'll take all the information
back to Homeland,

13:29.910 --> 13:31.278
but there's nothing
to worry about.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.279
- You know,
I'd swear on my mother's life

13:32.312 --> 13:33.914
that was Bob Lee Swagger.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.849
- Didn't you say
he stole some tools?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.417
Probably just a junkie looking
to sell them to get high.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.386
Swagger's been
in the news a lot.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.620
The mind plays tricks.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.355
- Hey, thanks.
- All right.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.133
[dramatic music]

13:53.166 --> 13:59.339
*

14:01.108 --> 14:02.943
- What are we doing here?
- I'm tracking down

14:02.976 --> 14:05.946
all of Dimitri Voydian's
connections.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.249
That's odd. A restaurant
that's closed for lunch?

14:11.251 --> 14:13.120
- I think we've got blood.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.256
Ready?

14:23.130 --> 14:30.137
*

14:35.708 --> 14:37.210
Who do you think did this?

14:47.687 --> 14:54.928
*

14:59.132 --> 15:00.500
- Let's wrap this up quickly.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.902
I don't need Herring
riding my ass again today.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.674
- I read the report
about Dimitri Voydian's guys.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.476
Sounds like a bloodbath.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.946
- Well, you know the Bratva.
They like to sign their work.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.947
- I head Agent Memphis was
first at the scene.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.048
How'd she take it?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.283
- I think she's losing it.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.451
Here's another insert for Simon.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.053
This morning it was
dead Russians

15:20.087 --> 15:21.121
and some big conspiracy,

15:21.154 --> 15:22.122
and now she's got a hard-on

15:22.155 --> 15:23.423
for the Tree of Liberty Militia.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.491
- Those clowns in Spokane?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.193
What do they have to do
with this?

15:26.226 --> 15:30.297
- Who knows? But she did
access all of their files.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.432
I wouldn't worry about it.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.202
Tomorrow she'll say
my grandmother took the shot.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.501
- Good afternoon.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.270
- That sign at the road says
"private property."

16:43.303 --> 16:44.771
Can't you read?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.573
- If you guys are looking
to keep people out,

16:46.606 --> 16:48.275
your perimeter's weak.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.009
- Damn dog.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.513
Take off that hat.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.614
- Do it!

16:54.647 --> 16:56.383
- Ain't gonna ask you again.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.085
- All right.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.791
- Holy shit,
we got us a dead man.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.526
- I heard about your cause.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.395
I thought I might find
some friendly faces.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.163
- What did you hear
about our cause?

17:10.197 --> 17:12.099
- That some good men decided
to let the government know

17:12.132 --> 17:13.400
we're not all sheep.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.436
- That's right!
- I can see I was right.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.472
- Joey, back up before he takes
your rifle from you.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.075
You can show them
a hundred times how it's done,

17:22.109 --> 17:25.278
and as soon as it gets real,

17:25.312 --> 17:26.613
it all goes to shit.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.450
Ain't that right, Swagger?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.554
[chuckles]

17:34.587 --> 17:36.523
Welcome to the Tree of Liberty.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.857
You're home.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.093
At ease, boys.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.429
- Guys, I'm not here
for trouble, and I'm unarmed.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.297
- We'll have to change that,
won't we?

17:46.533 --> 17:48.601
- Nothing quite like
old American iron.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.837
- We were taking bets
you faked your death.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.372
Smart play.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.640
- Yeah, it's kind of hard
to make moves

17:53.673 --> 17:55.142
when you've got the Feds
all over you.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.177
- I'm glad you found
your way here.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.279
Real honor to have
Bob Lee Swagger with us.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.549
- How do we even know
he is the real Swagger?

18:02.582 --> 18:05.318
Could be a look-alike the Feds
are using as a plant against us.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.254
- Sorry about
my little brother here.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.588
He loves his conspiracies.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.490
- Hey, it's not wrong
to be suspicious.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.503
[cheers and applause]
- [chuckles]

18:23.536 --> 18:25.172
You're Bob Lee Swagger,
all right.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.873
Damn, you can shoot.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.242
- If you're so great, how come
you missed the president?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.677
- 'Cause I didn't take
that shot.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.545
I was framed.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.348
The real assassin used
this bullet.

18:41.388 --> 18:45.392
- Ward, Kyle, please escort
our friend here to the rec room.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.626
Keep him there.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.362
I respect you, Swagger,

18:49.396 --> 18:50.530
but if you're looking
to screw us,

18:50.563 --> 18:52.332
you will regret it.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.337
[tense music]

18:57.370 --> 19:02.675
*

19:23.730 --> 19:25.965
- I got it.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.435
- You think I can't handle
my own duty bag?

19:28.468 --> 19:29.669
- Maybe I'm just being
a gentleman.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.572
- Oh, thanks, Mikey.
[scoffs]

19:41.781 --> 19:43.650
- Guess who's getting married
today?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.653
[suspenseful music]

19:46.686 --> 19:47.654
*

19:47.687 --> 19:49.256
- I don't know, Payne.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.323
One of your ex-boyfriends
from prison?

19:50.357 --> 19:52.292
- Cassie's sister, Angela.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.361
You remember Cassie.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.429
She was the hostage
that you killed.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.964
- Is this your version
of psy-ops?

19:57.997 --> 19:59.399
You suck at it.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.301
- "Dear Cass,

20:01.334 --> 20:03.470
"I don't have a maid of honor
for my wedding

20:03.503 --> 20:05.705
because I'm honoring
your memory."

20:05.738 --> 20:09.576
She says "honor" twice,
but you get the idea.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.578
- It was an accident,
and I made my peace with it.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.446
I made my peace with her family.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.814
What about you, Payne?

20:14.847 --> 20:16.516
Think you'll ever make yours?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.318
- Why would I need
to make peace?

20:18.351 --> 20:21.388
- How about a restaurant
full of dead Russians?

20:21.421 --> 20:23.756
- You got the rose?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.558
And you didn't even say
anything?

20:25.592 --> 20:28.295
- What's your deal, Payne?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.397
You sweet on me?

20:30.430 --> 20:32.365
You think I'm the one
who got away..

20:32.399 --> 20:34.000
literally?

20:34.033 --> 20:37.470
- Do you think you'll cry
at Swagger's funeral?

20:37.504 --> 20:40.039
I-I don't think so.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.442
But you might
at his wife and daughter's.

20:44.377 --> 20:48.348
[phone buzzing]

20:48.381 --> 20:54.487
*

20:54.521 --> 20:56.523
- [grunts]
Got you, asshole.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.392
- What the hell, Memphis?

21:16.676 --> 21:16.843
.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.844
- So, how, exactly,
did you come by this bullet?

21:19.612 --> 21:22.649
- That bullet unties my noose.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.584
I need to know
who you sold it to.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.587
- I got some bad news for you,
Marine.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.788
You gave us quite a scare.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.623
I thought we had
a breach of security.

21:30.657 --> 21:34.627
But that bullet that you brought
didn't come from us.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.696
- Where do you get these?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.365
- We make them ourselves.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.569
The ATF knows about the bullets
sold in stores.

21:42.602 --> 21:45.104
What we needed was
a new kind of round,

21:45.137 --> 21:47.674
one that they wouldn't be able
to predict.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.542
- Don't tell him
what we're working on.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.111
- Joey, I'm running things.
Not you.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.380
Is that clear?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.014
Bob Lee is not a threat.

21:55.047 --> 21:58.651
He's spilled more blood
for freedom than you ever will.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.020
- My kid brother here's
got a messed up eye.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.622
Can't shoot worth his shit.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.591
But he's a wizard
with the Internet.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.426
Runs our message boards for us

22:06.459 --> 22:07.794
and keeps in touch
with the brothers and sisters

22:07.827 --> 22:10.363
that can't make it here.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.798
- You guys got
a lot of followers?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.633
- We're going to soon.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.067
- And then what's the plan?

22:15.101 --> 22:16.736
- Guerilla warfare.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.638
Federal government's been
closing in on Americans

22:18.671 --> 22:20.840
like a vice--
every year a little bit more.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.709
Somebody has got to stand up.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.811
Second Amendment calls
for a well-armed militia,

22:24.844 --> 22:26.546
and that's us.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.548
- If they think they can create
a One World Government,

22:28.581 --> 22:30.783
they're gonna have
another thing coming.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.719
- Yeah, but where do you get
the materials, though?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.387
This can't be store-bought.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.155
- We got a guy that makes
that stuff for us.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.426
Crazy old kook up in Idaho.
But he supports the cause.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.627
- What's his name?

22:41.794 --> 22:43.730
- Ah, sorry, Swagger.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.565
Operational security.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.867
That polymer supply is
too valuable to lose.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.536
- Understood.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.603
- All right, then.
You're welcome to stay

22:50.637 --> 22:51.638
as long as you want.

22:51.671 --> 22:52.805
We could use another long gun.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.542
Joey here, he'll set you up.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.577
You're safe with us, Swagger.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.580
[dramatic music]

23:55.902 --> 23:57.203
[gunshot]

23:59.772 --> 24:02.509
- All right. You've got
to stabilize the rifle.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.912
Tuck the stock
into your shoulder.

24:05.945 --> 24:09.482
Now use your non-shooting hand
to hold it tight.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.684
You want the rifle to feel
like it's part of you.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.686
After that, it's all about
your breathing.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.488
Block out everything else.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.990
Focus on the cross hairs
and the target.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.727
Now at the very end
of your exhale, you hold,

24:20.760 --> 24:22.629
then gently pull the trigger.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.499
All right.
Range is hot.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.734
Send it.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.609
[shell clinks]

[James laughs]

24:41.213 --> 24:43.015
[gunshot]

24:43.049 --> 24:45.518
- Man, I told you
he couldn't shoot for shit.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.654
- His technique is good.
He just needs time.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.022
Great shooters are at the range
every day.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.924
It's practice, not instinct.

24:51.958 --> 24:55.595
- Time ain't gonna help.
Every person plays their part.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.764
Joey's here ain't behind a gun.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.710
- Hey, you forgot
to secure your weapon.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.814
- When are you leaving?

25:14.847 --> 25:16.282
We got shit to do,
and you're not a part of it.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.850
- Don't worry.
I'm leaving.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.287
Whatever you're planning,
it's not my business,

25:21.320 --> 25:23.022
but I just don't see an endgame.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.825
- When free men realize that
they have a place in this world,

25:25.858 --> 25:26.926
they'll come.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.695
- And then what?

25:28.728 --> 25:29.762
- If the Tree of Liberty gets
big enough,

25:29.796 --> 25:31.230
they'll have to listen.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.865
Good men have been laying down
for too long.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.267
It's time to stand up.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.637
- How old are you, Joey?
- 17. Why?

25:37.670 --> 25:39.238
- You go to high school?

25:39.271 --> 25:42.575
- Shit. It's just another form
of indoctrination.

25:42.609 --> 25:45.712
- It's also a pretty good place
to meet girls.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.747
Listen, man.
All I'm saying is,

25:47.780 --> 25:50.817
there's a lot more life
out there.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.351
- My brother needs me.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.921
- Family's important.
I get it.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.889
But don't get so caught up
in your brother's story

25:56.923 --> 25:58.591
that you lose your own.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.995
All right, I'm gonna
hit the head and split.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.731
Which way is it?

26:04.764 --> 26:06.833
- Makeshift latrine's
two buildings over.

[phone ringing]

26:55.948 --> 26:57.784

26:57.817 --> 26:59.786
- Hey, man, you know
those Tree of Liberty guys?

26:59.819 --> 27:01.754
They're planning something big.
- Who is this?

27:01.788 --> 27:03.422
- I used to believe
in James Richards, man,

27:03.455 --> 27:06.793
but I don't know--they got
a van full of explosives, dude.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.995
This ain't
what the Tree's about.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.397
- Sir, I'm gonna need
your name and location.

27:11.430 --> 27:14.400
Hello?
Hello?

27:14.433 --> 27:15.802
[sighs]

27:21.974 --> 27:24.410
Hey. How soon can we get
a surveillance team together?

27:24.443 --> 27:28.815
*

27:28.848 --> 27:30.683
- Where you been, Swagger?

27:30.717 --> 27:32.384
- Isn't the bathroom back there?

27:32.418 --> 27:34.153
- You think we're stupid?

27:34.186 --> 27:37.423
I know you saw what we've got.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.091
- Okay, man,
whatever you guys are planning,

27:39.125 --> 27:40.827
I'm sure you got good reason
for it.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.194
But it's got nothing to do
with me.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.996
So I'm just gonna push on.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.701
- You can't win a war
that hasn't started.

27:48.735 --> 27:51.904
People need to wake the hell up,
and we're gonna wake them.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.840
- Joey, we got a situation.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.442
You got eyes on Swagger?

27:56.475 --> 27:58.745
- God damn right, I do.
What's the matter?

27:58.778 --> 28:00.713
- Bring him to the armory.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.884
I caught him outside
with a rifle in his gear.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.988
He's a Fed.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.859
You know him?

28:15.261 --> 28:16.829
- Yep.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.433
He's been hunting me
since I escaped from prison.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.204
Thought I lost him
when I faked my death.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.807
- It's like I've been
telling you.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.009
I only came here
to arrest Bob Lee.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.744
The rest of you guys aren't
my concern.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.512
- Shut up, redcoat.
- Don't you see?

28:33.545 --> 28:35.748
Swagger cut some kind of deal.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.917
We take him in,
he gets the lay of the land,

28:37.950 --> 28:40.753
then calls the Feds.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.789
I just caught him snooping
in the garage.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.757
He saw everything.

28:44.791 --> 28:48.060
- So, what, is that your play,
Swagger?

28:48.094 --> 28:49.896
- Let me ask you a question.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.864
Was he alone?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.935
You ever see a Fed operating
like that?

28:55.968 --> 28:58.805
Those boys can't take a shit
without getting three approvals.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.439
And I don't know
what this asshole's up to,

29:00.472 --> 29:03.776
but if he were legit,
he wouldn't be out here alone.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.479
My guess is he's trying
to be a hero.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.181
- Look,

29:09.215 --> 29:12.051
we can negotiate a solu--
[grunts]

29:12.084 --> 29:14.486
- What did I say about talking?

29:14.520 --> 29:17.256
You know what?
It's time to water the tree.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.792
- I got a better idea.

29:19.826 --> 29:22.995
Why don't we have a little fun?

29:23.029 --> 29:24.130
Could walk him down range

29:24.163 --> 29:26.899
and have some target practice.

29:26.933 --> 29:32.104
*

29:32.138 --> 29:33.973
- All right.
Sounds good to me.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.108
Let's paint a bull's-eye on him.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.277
At 800 yards.

29:38.310 --> 29:41.848
- Nah, 800's too easy.

29:50.322 --> 29:50.489
.

29:50.522 --> 29:51.457
- Payne's getting bolder.
I can't protect you.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.394
The FBI thinks Bob Lee's dead.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.996
There's no threat to you,

29:57.029 --> 29:58.130
according to
the official narrative.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.999
- But according
to your narrative?

30:00.032 --> 30:02.134
- You heard
about the Russian killings?

30:02.168 --> 30:03.335
- Yeah.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.306
- When Bob Lee survived,
it was great for you,

30:07.339 --> 30:09.408
but bad for everyone
who set him up.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.411
Now a lot of nervous people are
trying to clean up their mess,

30:12.444 --> 30:15.014
and you and Mary are
part of that.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.249
- And this guy works for
the people who did it to us?

30:17.283 --> 30:19.285
- Yes.
And I think it's best

30:19.318 --> 30:22.922
that I put you guys in the wind
for a while.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.123
- You live with a sniper
long enough,

30:24.156 --> 30:25.357
you learn a few things.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.293
Can't take any shots
with your back turned.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.395
So, why don't we put Payne
in the wind?

30:29.428 --> 30:31.197
See how he likes it.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.965
- Julie?

30:32.999 --> 30:34.166
Julie, hold on.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.506
- [whistles]

30:40.539 --> 30:44.143
- We're rolling.
Get her on. Get her on.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.045
Mrs. Swagger,
do you still believe

30:46.078 --> 30:47.279
your husband was innocent?

30:47.313 --> 30:50.049
- Bob Lee didn't do any of this.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.984
He's not some crazy assassin,

30:52.018 --> 30:53.185
and he didn't try to kill
the president.

30:53.219 --> 30:54.486
And before you write me off

30:54.520 --> 30:56.956
as some crazy wife
who's in denial,

30:56.989 --> 30:58.457
I would ask that you would
review the same files

30:58.490 --> 31:00.326
the FBI is reviewing right now.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.261
- Who is that? Does the FBI
have another suspect?

31:02.294 --> 31:04.130
- His name is Jack Payne,

31:04.163 --> 31:07.533
and the FBI believe that
he could be the actual assassin.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.468
So if any of you have
any information

31:09.501 --> 31:11.237
about him or his whereabouts,

31:11.270 --> 31:12.538
I encourage you
to please report them

31:12.571 --> 31:15.307
to Special Agent Nadine Memphis.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.109
She's available
for your questions.

31:17.143 --> 31:19.478
- Agent Memphis, is the FBI
pursuing alternate theories

31:19.511 --> 31:20.947
about the assassination?

31:20.980 --> 31:22.148
Can you tell us anything?

31:22.181 --> 31:24.016
- Um...

31:24.050 --> 31:26.385
the FBI will not comment
on any ongoing investigation...

31:26.418 --> 31:28.054
[stammers]
At this time.

31:28.087 --> 31:31.123
- So the investigation is
still open?

31:31.157 --> 31:33.125
- No comment.

31:33.159 --> 31:36.128
[dramatic music]

*

31:42.068 --> 31:45.104
[unintelligible chatter]

31:54.280 --> 31:56.282
- Let's get this thing
in the air as soon as possible.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.260
- You gonna tease this out?

32:08.294 --> 32:10.262
- Maybe I'm tired.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.131
Maybe my hip hurts.

32:12.164 --> 32:15.234
Maybe I just like
seeing you suffer.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.436
- You're not really gonna
go through with this.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.406
- You crawled out here alone
in a ghillie suit

32:20.439 --> 32:22.374
with a suppressed weapon.

32:22.408 --> 32:25.511
You expect me to believe
you're on a rescue mission?

32:25.544 --> 32:27.613
We deal in lead.

32:27.646 --> 32:28.614
Grow up.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.216
- [grunts]

32:35.321 --> 32:40.226
You know, I always thought
I'd die in a gun fight.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.261
- You were half right.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.297
In another world, I would've
shot you the minute I saw you.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.633
But these guys have
a van-load of bad shit,

32:47.666 --> 32:50.569
and they're planning
on using it.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.271
I can't let that happen.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.543
- So why don't you untie me
and let me help?

32:57.576 --> 32:59.311
- Oh, sorry, Captain.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.580
Call me crazy,

33:01.613 --> 33:03.215
but I don't trust you.

33:05.084 --> 33:10.122
Hopefully Richards isn't as good
a shot as he thinks he is,

33:10.156 --> 33:11.623
but I've been wrong
about people before.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.674
All right.
Let's do this.

33:29.641 --> 33:36.682
*

33:52.298 --> 33:53.499
- You ready,
or you need some time

33:53.532 --> 33:56.135
to catch your breath
from that little walk?

33:56.168 --> 33:57.469
- I'm good, Joey.

34:02.708 --> 34:06.712
- On scope, range is exactly
1,625 yards.

34:06.745 --> 34:13.119
[James humming]

34:13.152 --> 34:14.620

always could hum.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.463

34:27.699 --> 34:30.636
Damn it! Should've accounted
for a half-factor wind.

34:30.669 --> 34:33.505
- Seems like a rookie mistake
for a sniper of your caliber.

34:40.412 --> 34:43.182
- We've got picture.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.517
- 10 to 12 structures.

34:45.551 --> 34:49.155
I count one, two--
five areas obscured by cover

34:49.188 --> 34:50.622
large enough to store
ammonium nitrate

34:50.656 --> 34:51.623
or other explosives.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.259
See a van?

34:53.292 --> 34:54.726
- No, sir.
Just this group of three males

34:54.760 --> 34:56.295
shooting long arms.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.564
- Get in closer.
See if we can ID them.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.600
- Watch how the Navy does it,
Jarhead.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.601
[man chuckling]

35:02.634 --> 35:05.437

any closer than I did,

35:07.739 --> 35:09.308
even with your fancy bullet.

35:09.341 --> 35:12.444
- [laughs]
All right. You're on.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.346
But I don't want to hear
any whining about the bullet

35:14.380 --> 35:16.382

- Just short.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.733
- Hey, that asshole came
out here to erase me.

35:34.766 --> 35:38.637
At least give me the chance
to return the favor.

35:38.670 --> 35:42.241
- All right.
Fine.

35:42.274 --> 35:43.375
But don't miss.

35:47.379 --> 35:54.386

35:59.458 --> 36:01.260

are you waiting for?

36:01.293 --> 36:02.494

36:02.528 --> 36:03.495
We've got company.

Let's go. We're moving out.

You know what to do.

We've been compromised.
Everybody to your positions.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.322
- Come on, man,
we're on the same side.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.291
- Oh, is that right?
I've seen you shoot, Swagger,

36:32.324 --> 36:34.393
and you don't miss,
even from a mile.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.395
I'm thinking maybe my brother
was right about you.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.430
- Your brother's about to make
a terrible mistake.

36:38.464 --> 36:41.300
- My brother's about to go down
in history, just like you.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.536
I don't get it, Swagger.

36:44.570 --> 36:45.771
I welcomed you with open arms.

The ATF is closing in.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.681
You should get your people
out of here.

your brother filled this van.

Stay low.
I'll put down cover fire.

out of here.

you'd know where to meet him.

That's the name of the guy
who sold us the polymer.

He had a weird first name.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.755
- Yeah.
You know him?

38:09.788 --> 38:12.391
- All right. Head south.
Find the river.

where Payne is right now?

38:54.433 --> 38:57.369
it hasn't
even gotten bad yet.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.106
The FBI believes he could be
the actual assassin,

39:01.139 --> 39:03.375

have any information

is the FBI pursuing

alternate theories
about the assassination?

39:11.817 --> 39:15.654
Can you tell us anything?

- Can I have the room?

Not only have you embarrassed
yourself,

39:40.479 --> 39:41.847
you've embarrassed
this entire bureau.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.849
- I had no idea she was gonna
react that way.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.518
- You disclosed information
about an ongoing investigation.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.655
- You're right, but I know
I'm on the right side of this.

39:49.688 --> 39:52.591
Getting more agencies and the
press to start an investigation

39:52.624 --> 39:53.825

this case.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.877
- * Daddy done lost his mind

40:45.911 --> 40:48.179
- I heard you wanted to see me.

40:48.213 --> 40:53.251
* Heaven or hell
it's the same *

40:53.284 --> 40:58.256
* Fire in the burning eyes

40:58.289 --> 41:03.228
* Big boys cry without
the shame the shame the shame *
