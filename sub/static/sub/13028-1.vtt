00:08.820 --> 00:10.666
- He's on the move,

00:10.666 --> 00:12.928
everything's coming to a head now.

00:12.928 --> 00:14.407
- I've sent a team.

00:14.407 --> 00:15.964
- A team?

00:15.964 --> 00:19.431
You mean that fledgling
magician and her mangy crew?

00:19.431 --> 00:22.953
Did you know they're calling
themselves the Redthorns?

00:27.269 --> 00:29.592
- Just like old times.

00:30.842 --> 00:33.871
- The Darkspore wants to be whole,

00:33.871 --> 00:36.708
and all the heroes put together,

00:36.708 --> 00:38.849
the living and the dead ones,

00:38.849 --> 00:42.157
couldn’t keep it apart now.

00:42.157 --> 00:44.145
- I have faith in Marek.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.483
- You had faith in Szorlok once too.

00:47.483 --> 00:49.790
What makes her any different?

00:49.790 --> 00:52.864
Even if you had the
final piece, what then?

00:52.864 --> 00:55.371
You haven't got any
plan what to do with it.

00:55.371 --> 00:58.720
- I'll give it to the
gods, they can protect it.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.011
- The gods.

01:00.011 --> 01:02.864
How long before they toss that trinket?

01:02.864 --> 01:06.726
Find a way to destroy
it, or you got nothing.

01:06.726 --> 01:11.726
Until then, you’re just buying time.

01:11.804 --> 01:13.943
- I had a vision.

01:14.910 --> 01:16.756
I saw Szorlok and his undead armies,

01:16.756 --> 01:20.233
marching death across the
land, from East to West,

01:20.233 --> 01:23.772
until the last living
cities ran into the sea.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.344
I also saw a dwarf,

01:28.344 --> 01:31.212
without a face, wearing an iron crown.

01:31.212 --> 01:34.051
- What else did you see?

01:39.783 --> 01:41.794
You know my mind.

01:41.794 --> 01:43.555
I'm after that crown.

01:43.555 --> 01:45.473
You help me get it, and I’ll help you find

01:45.473 --> 01:47.553
the Hammer of Tek.

01:47.553 --> 01:50.093
The one weapon that could
destroy the Darkspore,

01:50.093 --> 01:51.970
once and for all.

01:51.970 --> 01:55.149
- The Happer of Tek is
gone, no one knows where.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.031
And no mortal can wield it.

01:58.031 --> 02:01.477
- Well, with the Iron Crown
of the Dwarves, I could.

02:04.373 --> 02:06.527
- Szorlok has the Iron Crown.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.447
- That he does.

02:08.447 --> 02:11.487
- You'd trade anything for
that crown, wouldn't you?

02:11.487 --> 02:16.053
But not to find the Hammer,
or fight against Szorlok.

02:17.353 --> 02:20.634
Your plan is to unite the dwarves again

02:20.634 --> 02:22.448
and rule as their king.

02:22.448 --> 02:23.974
- You've had your chance.

02:23.974 --> 02:27.227
Your team gave three
pieces to Szorlok already.

02:27.227 --> 02:30.812
I'll do what pleases me, just as you have.

02:30.812 --> 02:33.966
I've already taken steps.

02:36.018 --> 02:38.127
- As have I.

02:42.720 --> 02:45.120
- Cunning as a snake.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.774
- Going into the woods.

03:23.774 --> 03:26.976
- Caia-bekk, you're up.

03:26.976 --> 03:29.099
Let's have a look.

04:22.450 --> 04:23.944
- Water, you wench!

04:23.944 --> 04:25.821
I'm so thirsty I could drink sand!

04:25.821 --> 04:28.840
- Oh, I'm brewing a batch of my finest,

04:28.840 --> 04:31.390
when it's ready you can have all you like.

04:31.390 --> 04:33.448
- You dare to touch me!

04:33.448 --> 04:35.785
My father is surely
sending heroes after me,

04:35.785 --> 04:37.967
and he will have you flogged to death!

04:37.967 --> 04:40.547
I can't wait to see you
bleed out in the square!

04:40.547 --> 04:42.981
I'll spit on your corpse, you bastard.

04:42.981 --> 04:45.947
- What a lovely creature you are.

04:45.947 --> 04:48.507
Don't worry, soon enough,

04:48.507 --> 04:51.345
I'll tame you just like my other girls.

04:51.345 --> 04:55.524
- Don't you dare compare
me to those witless whores!

05:01.894 --> 05:03.714
- Charming.

05:46.157 --> 05:48.965
- If you want to live, drop your weapons

05:48.965 --> 05:50.865
and get away from the wagon.

05:53.563 --> 05:55.142
- It's an ambush.

05:55.142 --> 05:56.998
Keep her alive, kill the others.

05:56.998 --> 05:58.363
- Grab her boys.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.570
- Ahh!

06:20.953 --> 06:24.037
- Bah, kill them all!

06:24.037 --> 06:26.352
- Get her, get her!

06:30.935 --> 06:33.281
- Ahh!

06:46.074 --> 06:48.378
- Amateurs.

06:48.378 --> 06:51.662
- Do you care to wager?

06:51.662 --> 06:54.008
- 20 if they even get inside.

06:54.008 --> 06:56.783
Another 20 if they get the shard.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.704
- I'll take it.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.731
- That's the problem with
crossbows, gentlemen.

07:26.731 --> 07:29.267
Slow reload time.

07:53.234 --> 07:54.536
- Driver, run her down.

09:22.674 --> 09:24.509
- Oh fyke!

09:31.796 --> 09:34.274
- I'm gonna kill you, you bastard!

09:37.334 --> 09:39.881
- Come on, Thane, keep up.

09:48.291 --> 09:51.336
No, no, hey this is your stop, eh.

09:51.336 --> 09:53.530
Come on Thane, come on.

09:53.530 --> 09:55.025
Come on boy.

10:04.524 --> 10:05.484
No!

10:06.685 --> 10:08.637
- Amateurs.

10:08.637 --> 10:10.441
- You might as well pay up now.

10:10.441 --> 10:12.501
They're going to blow it.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.026
- Welcome back.

10:36.353 --> 10:38.656
- Keep up!

10:47.064 --> 10:49.187
- What is it Thane?

10:49.187 --> 10:51.215
- I have.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.784
- Can you go help Marek up front?

10:52.784 --> 10:54.063
You're no use to me back here.

10:54.063 --> 10:55.697
- I have keys!

10:55.697 --> 10:58.257
- Oh, why didn't you say so?

11:05.883 --> 11:08.603
- That's enough from you.

11:08.603 --> 11:10.609
Stay down.

11:31.527 --> 11:33.768
- I'll take these, thank you.

11:52.865 --> 11:54.102
- Right.

11:54.102 --> 11:56.411
- Move.

11:57.367 --> 11:59.398
He's almost in.

12:01.186 --> 12:03.015
- Still got it.

12:05.987 --> 12:09.229
- They're inside, pay up.

12:15.629 --> 12:20.629
- Oh yes, you, you do know how to travel.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.468
- Yes.

12:24.468 --> 12:25.428
Have a set.

12:25.428 --> 12:26.698
- I shall.

12:26.698 --> 12:27.807
- Something to drink?

12:27.807 --> 12:29.258
- Please.

12:29.258 --> 12:31.172
- Ah.

12:33.516 --> 12:36.218
- Give me the Darkspore.

12:37.312 --> 12:40.395
- When you're dying,
and you're bleeding out

12:40.395 --> 12:42.827
wishing you'd done things differently,

12:42.827 --> 12:44.534
I want you to remember this moment,

12:44.534 --> 12:47.147
when I gave you one last
chance to walk away.

12:47.147 --> 12:50.210
- Hold on, hold on.

12:50.210 --> 12:53.378
We're not here to kill you,
we just want the Darkspore.

12:56.254 --> 12:58.174
- Yes, we will kill you,

12:58.174 --> 13:00.596
unless you give us what we want.

13:00.596 --> 13:03.861
- Yeah, like the lady says.

13:19.009 --> 13:20.503
- Hm, you've mistakenly robbed

13:20.503 --> 13:23.405
The infamous Admiral Borlund Hess.

13:23.405 --> 13:27.288
This is my wagon, my women, my Darkspore,

13:27.288 --> 13:30.232
and you squandered your one
last opportunity to walk away.

13:30.232 --> 13:32.472
- Yes, we know, you're smart, powerful,

13:32.472 --> 13:35.470
we're going to regret it,

13:35.470 --> 13:39.011
but this is our wagon now,

13:39.011 --> 13:42.446
and it's time for you to leave.

13:42.446 --> 13:43.907
- Okay.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.510
I'm gonna give you a choice.

13:46.510 --> 13:49.647
We can fight this to the death,

13:49.647 --> 13:51.581
or we can stop the wagon,

13:51.581 --> 13:55.187
and I can walk out with
my last shreds of dignity.

13:55.187 --> 13:57.704
Either way, I'm not stepping off

13:57.704 --> 14:01.886
my own fyking war wagon at full speed.

14:01.886 --> 14:04.698
- I'm good with the second option.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.739
- Thane!

14:11.672 --> 14:13.635
- At least the weather's nice.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.603
Good day for a walk.

14:23.356 --> 14:25.172
- I shouldn't have touched it.

14:25.172 --> 14:29.580
- Nonsense, you were brilliant
sweetheart, we got it.

14:55.011 --> 14:57.777
- It's not over yet.

15:28.867 --> 15:32.707
- Your necromancer's touch
awakened the final piece.

15:32.707 --> 15:34.841
I must thank you.

15:34.841 --> 15:37.699
Without your aid, I may
never have found it.

15:37.699 --> 15:42.020
To show you my gratitude,
I'll give you another chance.

15:42.020 --> 15:46.863
Join me, and your friends may live.

16:17.605 --> 16:19.792
You think you can defeat me?

16:19.792 --> 16:24.792
Even with three pieces, I
command the denizens of the pit.

16:26.192 --> 16:29.439
I call you forth from the grave,

16:29.439 --> 16:34.439
assassins of old, Multu-gahnuken!

16:52.578 --> 16:56.531
You once served the Lich King Vekru Nom,

16:56.531 --> 16:59.885
and now you serve me.

17:01.128 --> 17:03.037
The last piece.

17:03.037 --> 17:06.240
I can sense its power.

17:13.321 --> 17:15.776
Power over death.

17:15.776 --> 17:19.103
Immortality is mine at last.

17:19.103 --> 17:22.114
Bring me the Darkspore!

17:27.273 --> 17:30.453
- Marek, take the Darkspore
where the Gods can protect it.

17:30.453 --> 17:33.494
- She's not taking it anywhere.

17:33.494 --> 17:36.812
All of you together are
still no match for me.

17:36.812 --> 17:41.166
- Marek, I believe in you.

17:41.166 --> 17:42.246
- No!

17:42.246 --> 17:44.597
- Gojun, no!

18:26.827 --> 18:28.427
- Obey me.

18:28.427 --> 18:32.384
I am Marek, a true born necromancer.

18:32.384 --> 18:36.520
Szorlok is gone, you are mine to command.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.867
- Marek.

18:40.037 --> 18:42.703
You have no authority.

18:42.703 --> 18:47.045
The Darkspore speaks, and
it does not call you master.

18:47.045 --> 18:48.796
- Worth a try.

18:48.796 --> 18:50.857
- Thanks very much.

19:15.399 --> 19:16.375
- This isn't going well.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.924
- Do you have any ideas?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.484
- Hold them off!

19:26.556 --> 19:28.158
- We're leaving.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.389
- Go Marek, go!

19:46.531 --> 19:47.930
- What were those things?

19:47.930 --> 19:49.412
- I'd rather not know.

19:49.412 --> 19:51.588
- And that's the other half.

19:51.588 --> 19:55.408
You know, I like this team.

19:55.408 --> 19:57.336
They're full of surprises.

20:10.561 --> 20:12.750
- The wind is against us, Admiral.

20:12.750 --> 20:16.088
- Patience, the wind is ever changing.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.544
- Well, aside from nightmarish demons,

20:44.544 --> 20:47.083
from an entirely different dimension,

20:47.083 --> 20:49.558
I'd say that went rather well.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.069
Also, unless anyone can boast
a number higher than seven,

20:55.069 --> 20:56.629
I do believe I'm the winner.

20:56.629 --> 20:57.707
Marek, you owe me a kiss.

20:57.707 --> 20:58.929
Thane, 40 silver will do just fine.

20:58.929 --> 21:00.508
- You didn't kill seven.

21:00.508 --> 21:03.912
I killed six, you killed
three, maybe four.

21:04.922 --> 21:06.890
- You're serious?

21:06.890 --> 21:09.389
Three on the side, three
on the back, that's six.

21:09.389 --> 21:11.171
One off the roof makes seven.

21:11.171 --> 21:12.889
40 silver please
- He wasn't dead.

21:12.889 --> 21:15.034
- His head hit the road full in the face.

21:15.034 --> 21:16.294
- I saw him get up.

21:16.294 --> 21:17.717
- Then he was twitching from death throes.

21:17.717 --> 21:22.675
Marek, you owe me that
kiss, Thane, 40 silver.

21:22.675 --> 21:25.161
- Thane's always been a man of his word.

21:25.161 --> 21:27.273
- Are you calling me a liar?

21:27.273 --> 21:29.451
- No, of course not.

21:29.451 --> 21:31.287
But you are a very good thief.

21:31.287 --> 21:34.072
Not what you would call an honest trade.

21:34.072 --> 21:36.966
- Be that as it may, I will
pretend I didn't hear that.

21:36.966 --> 21:40.662
- Marek, where are we going?

21:42.109 --> 21:44.072
- Gojun said to take the Darkspore,

21:44.072 --> 21:47.209
someplace where the
gods can watch over it.

21:47.209 --> 21:50.969
- Uh-huh, so where are we going?

21:52.011 --> 21:53.932
- Well he couldn't say, because

21:53.932 --> 21:56.347
Szorlok was right there listening.

22:04.312 --> 22:05.844
- Oh, hello.

22:05.844 --> 22:07.734
I am so very sorry.

22:07.734 --> 22:09.516
Our deepest apologies.

22:09.516 --> 22:11.234
We've been very preoccupied.

22:11.234 --> 22:12.515
- Bastard!

22:12.515 --> 22:14.189
Some rescue!

22:14.189 --> 22:18.109
When my father finds out
how ill-treated I've been.

22:18.109 --> 22:19.197
Don't just sit there!

22:19.197 --> 22:21.960
Untie me, you half-breed.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.542
Disgusting, pointed devil ears.

22:27.542 --> 22:30.209
You, peasant wench, go
get me something to drink

22:30.209 --> 22:32.172
before my mouth turns to dust.

22:32.172 --> 22:34.344
- Pardon me?

22:34.344 --> 22:37.695
- Oh, fyke, get out of my
way, I'll do it myself.

22:40.710 --> 22:43.653
What does that depraved ogres have

22:43.653 --> 22:45.605
for a lady to drink around here?

22:45.605 --> 22:50.320
- I think, that maybe we
got off on the wrong foot.

22:50.320 --> 22:54.641
Let's start over, I'm Dagen, and you must.

22:54.641 --> 22:58.061
- Don't you dare touch me,
you are lower than a dog.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.484
- I could use a drink myself.

23:02.484 --> 23:06.341
- Ha, that black crystal
really gave it a nasty kick.

23:06.341 --> 23:09.113
- Black crystal, Dagen!

23:10.196 --> 23:12.159
- You impudent peasant!

23:12.159 --> 23:14.685
I will see to it that you.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.584
- I didn't swallow, I didn't swallow,

23:17.584 --> 23:19.418
I didn't swallow, I didn't swallow!

23:28.880 --> 23:30.544
- What's happened to her?

23:32.625 --> 23:35.526
- She's brain-dead, like the others.

23:35.526 --> 23:37.222
- Yes, well in her case,

23:37.222 --> 23:40.075
it's quite an improvement, isn't it?

23:41.201 --> 23:46.201
Uh, Marek, Marek, it's,
she's looking at me.

23:47.913 --> 23:49.837
Marek?

23:49.837 --> 23:50.767
No, no

23:51.398 --> 23:54.780
- It's the Darkspore, she's drawn to it.

23:56.380 --> 23:58.525
She likes you.

23:58.525 --> 24:01.319
- Of course, I mean females of all races,

24:01.319 --> 24:06.123
and states of mind, are drawn to.

24:06.123 --> 24:08.670
I mean she's not immune to all of this.

24:08.670 --> 24:10.334
- It's adorable.

24:10.334 --> 24:12.691
- What's taking so long?

24:12.691 --> 24:14.845
Marek kill her too?

24:14.845 --> 24:19.845
- Um, no, no, she's still alive.

24:20.083 --> 24:23.354
Sort of, I think.

24:30.252 --> 24:32.287
- Sorry.

24:32.287 --> 24:34.271
I'm not much of a healer.

24:34.271 --> 24:36.697
Not like Teela.

24:37.887 --> 24:40.056
- No one will ever be like Teela.

24:40.056 --> 24:43.444
Even as you took her
life, she healed your leg.

24:46.173 --> 24:49.088
- I'm here.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.279
Thane, it's me.

24:53.763 --> 24:55.621
- What was that?

24:57.624 --> 24:59.269
- What was what?

24:59.269 --> 25:00.946
- You.

25:02.437 --> 25:04.265
Are you alright?

25:06.736 --> 25:10.054
- Go South
to the Temple of the Owl.

25:10.054 --> 25:13.216
You will find me there.

25:16.311 --> 25:17.796
- How did you do that?

25:17.796 --> 25:18.956
- What?

25:18.956 --> 25:20.439
- It's not funny.

25:20.439 --> 25:22.156
- What are you talking about?

25:22.156 --> 25:24.674
- Go South, to the Temple o the Owl.

25:24.674 --> 25:25.751
- What are you saying?

25:25.751 --> 25:27.575
- You said it with Teela's voice.

25:27.575 --> 25:29.862
- Thane, stop, you're scaring me.

25:32.236 --> 25:34.792
- What exactly did you do to her?

25:36.198 --> 25:38.944
- I channeled her life force.

25:38.944 --> 25:41.458
It consumed here entirely.

25:43.341 --> 25:45.137
- She's there.

25:46.817 --> 25:49.337
Somehow she's inside of you.

25:50.687 --> 25:52.814
She spoke to me.

25:53.961 --> 25:56.182
- Thane, she's gone.

25:56.182 --> 25:57.312
Don't do this to yourself.

25:57.312 --> 25:59.106
- You did this to me!

25:59.106 --> 26:02.263
You took her from me!

26:02.263 --> 26:04.654
The Temple of the Owl, what is it?

26:04.654 --> 26:05.906
- It's a place.

26:05.906 --> 26:07.645
- Tell me!

26:08.878 --> 26:10.872
- I read about it once.

26:10.872 --> 26:13.541
A Temple of a Silver Owl.

26:13.541 --> 26:15.538
In Gojun's library.

26:15.538 --> 26:17.993
It's a holy site, a mythical place

26:19.093 --> 26:22.724
between this world and
the Realm of the Gods.

26:22.724 --> 26:26.266
A place where the gods can watch over it.

26:26.266 --> 26:27.924
- Is it to the South?

26:27.924 --> 26:29.865
- But it's just a myth,
it's not a real place.

26:29.865 --> 26:31.929
- Is it to the South?!

26:33.067 --> 26:36.070
- Beyond the White Waste, yes.

26:37.868 --> 26:39.425
- That's where we're going.

26:39.425 --> 26:40.588
- Thane, I,

26:40.588 --> 26:41.708
I think that maybe.

26:41.708 --> 26:43.521
- That's where Gojun
Pye meant for us to go.

26:43.521 --> 26:46.327
Now Teela is guiding us there.

26:46.327 --> 26:47.660
- Thane, I must have
just thought it out loud

26:47.660 --> 26:48.784
- If there's a chance,

26:48.784 --> 26:49.990
she's there.

26:49.990 --> 26:52.053
That she's alive somehow.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.553
There's nothing that will
keep me from reaching her.

26:58.103 --> 27:00.144
Nothing.

27:16.881 --> 27:19.972
- Gojun where are you?

27:27.493 --> 27:29.661
- What is this place?

27:31.600 --> 27:35.335
- We are banished to a
dimension of shadow and ash.

27:35.335 --> 27:37.039
Where nothing has ever lived.

27:37.039 --> 27:40.207
Nothing for you to feed on.

27:44.827 --> 27:46.765
- You fool!

27:46.765 --> 27:48.762
What have you done?

27:48.762 --> 27:52.143
- You have no power here, necromancer.

27:59.415 --> 28:01.537
- So this is your plan?

28:01.537 --> 28:04.012
How long do you think
you can keep me here?

28:04.012 --> 28:06.295
- I was planning on forever.

28:06.295 --> 28:08.609
Though I'm not sure time

28:08.609 --> 28:12.033
has any meaning in this particular realm.

28:13.095 --> 28:14.996
- Clever,

28:14.996 --> 28:19.231
so, what now?

28:19.231 --> 28:22.271
- Well I thought maybe
we could sit and chat.

28:22.271 --> 28:24.533
Reminisce about days gone by.

28:24.533 --> 28:26.987
- Or I could just kill you.

28:26.987 --> 28:30.234
- That depends how good
your channeling magic is.

28:30.234 --> 28:32.410
Do you even carry components?

28:32.410 --> 28:35.494
- Gojun, how soon you forget.

28:35.494 --> 28:39.772
I am a master of all magics!

29:01.378 --> 29:04.935
- Help me, please! Help!

29:14.544 --> 29:16.822
I can't move.

29:16.822 --> 29:19.026
I'm having trouble breathing.

29:21.443 --> 29:24.963
- It's alright, it's alright.

29:24.963 --> 29:26.361
I'm here to help you.

29:26.361 --> 29:27.705
- Oh thank you.

29:27.705 --> 29:29.519
I knew someone would come.

29:29.519 --> 29:32.282
- Something's not right.

29:32.282 --> 29:34.746
- You're my only hope.

29:37.656 --> 29:38.978
Please.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.962
- Degan, wait!

29:42.162 --> 29:43.969
- Hey, it's alright.

29:43.969 --> 29:45.712
It's alright.

29:50.945 --> 29:52.525
- Thank you Degan.

29:52.525 --> 29:54.392
You're truly my hero.

29:54.392 --> 29:56.616
- I'm your hero.

30:00.890 --> 30:02.629
- Degan!

30:07.248 --> 30:09.212
- I'm her hero.

30:09.212 --> 30:11.043
- You idiot!

30:12.010 --> 30:13.439
Thane!

30:13.439 --> 30:14.704
- Oh!

30:29.874 --> 30:33.741
- Give us back the Darkspore,
and we'll let you live.

30:35.358 --> 30:37.835
Never mind, I'd rather kill you.

31:05.731 --> 31:07.532
- Wait!

31:29.657 --> 31:30.873
- Rezzik?

31:30.873 --> 31:32.217
- You know him?

31:32.217 --> 31:34.510
- No.

31:44.624 --> 31:47.760
- Two blades are no match
for shield and sword.

32:07.935 --> 32:11.348
- Shields are for cowards who
need something to hide behind.

32:11.348 --> 32:13.881
- They're for men in retreat!

32:16.794 --> 32:19.387
- To kill a tortoise, you must simply find

32:19.387 --> 32:20.522
his soft spot.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.744
- Hey, listen, listen.

32:23.744 --> 32:25.046
Not to start pointing fingers,

32:25.046 --> 32:26.763
but she really is entirely to blame.

32:26.763 --> 32:28.023
Wouldn't take no for an answer.

32:28.023 --> 32:30.060
She's not even my type,
she's all skin and bones.

32:30.060 --> 32:31.287
- Shut up, thief!

32:31.287 --> 32:32.601
- Oh!

32:32.601 --> 32:36.143
Listen, listen, if this is about
that silver horn I borrowed

32:36.143 --> 32:38.986
I was going to give it back.

32:40.482 --> 32:42.812
Not that!

32:44.665 --> 32:46.675
Marek, switch!

32:48.281 --> 32:50.563
- Your lover and I have
a powerful connection.

32:50.563 --> 32:52.622
My charm has never worked so quickly.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.611
- He's not my lover!

32:55.611 --> 32:58.760
How's that for connection?

33:00.288 --> 33:01.856
- Marek!

33:04.928 --> 33:08.524
That was a dirty, dirty
trick to play, love.

33:09.634 --> 33:11.192
- Why do you want the Darkspore?

33:13.432 --> 33:16.196
- Your team has failed enough.

33:16.196 --> 33:18.777
- My team is sent by Gojun Pye.

33:18.777 --> 33:20.558
We have to stop Szorlok.

33:20.558 --> 33:22.852
- Hammerhead told me you'd say that.

33:22.852 --> 33:24.090
- Hammerhead?

33:24.090 --> 33:26.117
- How many times are you
going to give another piece

33:26.117 --> 33:28.271
to Szorlok before you bow out?

33:28.271 --> 33:30.298
Just walk away, we'll take it from here.

33:30.298 --> 33:31.418
- Not unless you can tell me

33:31.418 --> 33:33.914
why Hammerhead wants the Darkspore.

33:33.914 --> 33:36.253
- And you'll walk away?

33:37.617 --> 33:39.718
- If it's a good reason.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.848
- All right.

33:41.848 --> 33:44.242
I'll tell you what I know.

33:44.242 --> 33:47.443
He was drunk, I overheard
him muttering to himself,

33:47.443 --> 33:50.420
something about an Iron Crown.

33:50.420 --> 33:52.361
- That's it?

33:52.361 --> 33:53.609
It's not much to go on.

33:53.609 --> 33:54.921
I need to know his real intensions.

33:56.247 --> 33:58.401
- Diplomacy's not my best attribute.

34:02.243 --> 34:03.705
- Men are fools.

34:03.705 --> 34:05.092
- I'm only half man.

34:07.844 --> 34:09.690
And half elf.

34:09.690 --> 34:12.592
A thief, by trade, or
didn't Rezzik tell you?

34:12.592 --> 34:14.074
Very sticky fingers.

34:14.074 --> 34:15.920
I have the Darkspore, let's move!

34:15.920 --> 34:17.781
- Rezzik!

34:18.659 --> 34:20.505
- Horses!

34:28.050 --> 34:30.027
- Hurry up.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.656
- Why didn't you do that?

34:51.152 --> 34:52.679
- See, all fixed.

34:52.679 --> 34:53.981
No harm done.

34:53.981 --> 34:55.378
- There would have been nothing to fix,

34:55.378 --> 34:58.891
if you could only keep your
animal urges under control.

34:58.891 --> 35:00.035
- Animal urges?

35:00.035 --> 35:01.669
- Never mind, drive.

35:07.613 --> 35:10.557
- Managed to snag this, from her bosoms.

35:10.557 --> 35:13.008
- Her bosom?

35:13.008 --> 35:14.515
How did you manage?

35:14.515 --> 35:15.743
- Well.
- Never mind, I don't,

35:15.743 --> 35:17.561
I don't want to know.

35:18.634 --> 35:20.554
White Dragon eggshells.

35:20.554 --> 35:22.113
This is worth a fortune!

35:22.113 --> 35:25.399
- Like I said, no harm done.

35:31.993 --> 35:33.316
- You were saying?

35:33.316 --> 35:34.436
- Uh.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.857
- Anybody with range wanna get back here?

35:51.717 --> 35:55.803
- Surrender! It's over!

36:04.543 --> 36:06.089
- Are you gonna
shoot back at them?

36:06.089 --> 36:07.529
- I'm out of batwing resin!

36:07.529 --> 36:08.543
- What?

36:08.543 --> 36:10.325
- On my staff!

36:17.709 --> 36:19.405
- You're finished!

36:20.890 --> 36:22.967
- Get up, get up!

36:43.664 --> 36:45.606
- Is that all you've got?

36:45.606 --> 36:48.160
- We're gonna spill your guts out!

37:02.834 --> 37:04.762
- Woo-hoo!

37:09.796 --> 37:11.806
- Ugh!

37:13.337 --> 37:14.404
- What now?

37:14.404 --> 37:16.058
- We take the long way around.

37:16.058 --> 37:18.160
This isn't nearly over.

37:32.219 --> 37:34.998
- Why do we hve so many enemies?

37:34.998 --> 37:39.041
- Dagen, tell us about the ax men.

37:39.041 --> 37:42.930
- The ax men is Rezzik,
a notorious mercenary.

37:45.144 --> 37:47.565
- He mentioned a woman?

37:48.440 --> 37:49.534
- Yes he did.

37:49.534 --> 37:51.593
Well, she's nobody.

37:51.593 --> 37:52.958
I mean she's not nobody,

37:52.958 --> 37:55.038
she's wealthy daughter of a nobleman.

37:55.038 --> 37:57.322
High society, very well endowed.

37:57.322 --> 38:00.789
With gold, and nothing else.

38:00.789 --> 38:02.827
Well you can't blame the girl
for taking a liking to me

38:02.827 --> 38:04.065
over that barbarian.

38:04.065 --> 38:05.879
He doesn't even bathe properly.

38:05.879 --> 38:07.749
Sorry, she has good taste.

38:07.749 --> 38:09.605
Ah, you're not blaming this on me?

38:09.605 --> 38:12.732
- No, of course not,
you self obsessed libertine.

38:12.732 --> 38:14.152
They're after the Darkspore.

38:14.152 --> 38:15.666
- Oh.

38:15.666 --> 38:17.010
Ah!

38:17.010 --> 38:18.706
- And that is for
falling all over yourself

38:18.706 --> 38:22.386
to rescue that magician
- Why do they want the Darkspore?

38:22.386 --> 38:24.036
- They're working for Hammerhad.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.426
- Well that's perfect.

38:25.426 --> 38:26.479
It's all a big misunderstanding then.

38:26.479 --> 38:27.674
- No.

38:27.674 --> 38:30.555
Hammerhead hired them
because we keep failing.

38:30.555 --> 38:31.708
- Well that's even more perfect.

38:31.708 --> 38:32.988
We take the Darkspore to Hammerhead

38:32.988 --> 38:34.428
and we get a big sack of god.

38:34.428 --> 38:36.284
- You're not suggesting
we hand over the Darkspore

38:36.284 --> 38:38.449
to that snake of an innkeeper for money?

38:38.449 --> 38:39.303
- Go on.

38:39.303 --> 38:40.465
- He's more likely to sell it to Szorlok

38:40.465 --> 38:42.046
than to hide it from him.

38:42.046 --> 38:44.233
- I think Hammerhead wants to trade

38:44.233 --> 38:46.222
the Darkspore for the Iron Crown.

38:46.222 --> 38:47.605
- The Iron Crown.

38:47.605 --> 38:49.604
- The Iron Crown that would
make him king of the dwarves.

38:49.604 --> 38:50.927
- Well that's very lovely for Hammerhead,

38:50.927 --> 38:52.591
but I don't see what it has
to do with the Darkspore.

38:52.591 --> 38:54.468
- When the Golgotians
conquered and scattered

38:54.468 --> 38:56.625
the dwarves centuries ago.
- [Dagen} Golgotians?

38:56.625 --> 38:57.790
- They captured the Iron Crown.

38:57.790 --> 38:59.548
- Golgotians are Szorlok's people.

38:59.548 --> 39:02.065
- No, not his people, allies.

39:02.065 --> 39:02.908
- Oh.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.946
- But in any case,

39:04.946 --> 39:06.591
Szorlok may have the Iron Crown.

39:06.591 --> 39:08.872
- You think Szorlok want's
to be king of the dwarves?

39:08.872 --> 39:10.730
- Dagen, let me finish.

39:11.781 --> 39:12.976
There's a legendary hammer.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.171
The Hammer of Tek.

39:14.171 --> 39:16.070
- The Hammer that forged the world?

39:16.070 --> 39:18.929
- Legend has it that the Hammer of Tek

39:18.929 --> 39:21.148
cannot be held by any mortal hands,

39:21.148 --> 39:23.537
except one who wears the Iron Crown.

39:23.537 --> 39:24.775
- It's a wonderful children's story.

39:24.775 --> 39:26.535
- Yes, well assuming that it's real,

39:26.535 --> 39:27.889
Tek's Hammer could destroy anything.

39:27.889 --> 39:29.052
Which includes the Darkspore,

39:29.052 --> 39:31.409
so maybe Hammerhead wants
to get the Iron Crown

39:31.409 --> 39:33.372
so that he can get the Hammer,

39:33.372 --> 39:35.057
and destroy the Darkspore
for once and for all.

39:35.057 --> 39:37.618
Which on all accounts,
is a very real plan.

39:37.618 --> 39:38.962
No more running and hiding.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.189
- You're talking about
handing over the last piece

39:40.189 --> 39:41.458
of the Darkspore.

39:41.458 --> 39:44.338
Now unless I'm mistaken, that
makes Szorlok the Lich King.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.654
The whole world becomes undead.

39:46.654 --> 39:50.399
- Yes, even if we did have the Iron Crown,

39:50.399 --> 39:52.396
and found the Hammer of Tek.

39:52.396 --> 39:54.519
Destroying the Darkspore
may be impossible.

39:54.519 --> 39:55.501
Just because you have a sword,

39:55.501 --> 39:56.781
doesn't mean you can slay a dragon.

39:56.781 --> 39:58.477
- Yes, but I still think we
should take it to Hammerhead,

39:58.477 --> 40:00.439
and at least see what his intentions are.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.998
- Gojun said to take the Darkspore

40:01.998 --> 40:03.983
to where the gods can protect it.
- Look, Thane!

40:03.983 --> 40:05.625
Gojun is not here right now!

40:05.625 --> 40:08.102
- We're gonna go with Gojun's plan
- He's gone, he's probably dead.

40:08.102 --> 40:09.432
- Teela will take us to the temple.
-  - Alright I'm sorry Marek, but that's

40:09.432 --> 40:10.776
how it is, I vote Hammerhead
- Enough!

40:10.776 --> 40:12.909
Listen to you two.

40:12.909 --> 40:15.437
This is not a vote!

40:15.437 --> 40:18.829
Right now, we gonna follow the road.

40:18.829 --> 40:21.050
This road, the only road.

40:21.050 --> 40:24.133
I need time to rest and think.

40:24.133 --> 40:26.420
Don't eat that.

40:30.778 --> 40:32.239
- It's the right thing to.

40:32.239 --> 40:34.917
Did you say Teela will guide us?

40:34.917 --> 40:37.269
You're not worshiping her now?

40:38.480 --> 40:40.864
Wait, you're not, right?

40:56.315 --> 40:58.549
- Not now Thane.

41:00.669 --> 41:03.207
- We need to speak to her.

41:04.877 --> 41:06.302
- She's dead.

41:09.934 --> 41:12.856
- Somehow she's inside of you.

41:12.856 --> 41:14.178
I have to believe.

41:14.178 --> 41:18.884
- You'll believe anything
that might bring Teela back.

41:18.884 --> 41:22.123
But you don't know how necromancy works.

41:23.157 --> 41:27.137
I remember it, every detail.

41:30.151 --> 41:32.139
I killed her,

41:33.969 --> 41:36.732
I sucked every drop of her life force

41:36.732 --> 41:40.916
and used it to destroy.

41:46.369 --> 41:49.428
- We have to get her out of you.

41:50.388 --> 41:53.476
For your sake, and for hers.

41:56.608 --> 41:59.328
- Get some sleep, Thane.

41:59.328 --> 42:01.450
You need it.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.630
- You and me both sweetheart.

42:21.630 --> 42:23.844
We're not gonna let the
crazies get to us, right?

42:23.844 --> 42:25.756
We're gonna keep it together.

42:27.140 --> 42:29.879
Right?

42:29.879 --> 42:32.486
Can you understand anything I'm saying?

42:32.486 --> 42:36.193
Just raise your hand or
something if you can, yeah?

42:42.269 --> 42:44.055
Okay.

42:46.644 --> 42:49.566
Alright, look, one time Thane
told me Marek was upstairs.

42:49.566 --> 42:51.604
I went there, it was
Hammerhead's room instead.

42:51.604 --> 42:54.542
It was all very embarrassing,
he was not impressed.

42:58.019 --> 42:59.459
- Feels rather good.

42:59.459 --> 43:02.158
You're an excellent listener.

43:02.158 --> 43:04.389
Come on, come here.

43:04.389 --> 43:07.109
That's alright, come on.

43:07.109 --> 43:09.306
There you are.

43:09.306 --> 43:11.954
Hey, no!

43:11.954 --> 43:15.726
Absolutely not, none of that!

43:17.097 --> 43:20.259
That's good, there you go, stay there.

43:36.033 --> 43:38.546
- Thane.

43:40.216 --> 43:42.520
Thane.

43:57.831 --> 43:59.132
- Teela.

43:59.132 --> 44:02.406
- Thane, it's your turn.

44:04.456 --> 44:06.571
Oh.

44:07.686 --> 44:09.319
- What are you doing?

44:09.319 --> 44:11.580
Get away from me!

44:11.580 --> 44:13.547
- Let me out!

44:14.983 --> 44:16.840
- I'm not her.

44:28.929 --> 44:30.008
- Dagen.

44:30.008 --> 44:32.364
- You don't need to say anything.

44:32.364 --> 44:34.572
Gods know I've been begging
for a kiss from you,

44:34.572 --> 44:36.409
a little sign of affection, something,

44:36.409 --> 44:38.767
and it was Thane all along.

44:38.767 --> 44:41.551
It's fine, go back to him, have at it.

44:41.551 --> 44:42.970
I won't get in the way.

44:42.970 --> 44:43.951
- You're impossible.

44:43.951 --> 44:45.476
- I'm impossible?

44:45.476 --> 44:49.956
Do what you want, I'm done
with you, you crazy girl!

45:02.672 --> 45:04.632
We need to refuel.

45:04.632 --> 45:07.257
- We're almost to the White Waste.

45:07.257 --> 45:11.353
The Temple of the Owl
is somewhere out there.

45:11.353 --> 45:13.902
- Well, keep that.

45:13.902 --> 45:15.219
- Dagen.

45:15.219 --> 45:17.577
- You little lovebirds,

45:17.577 --> 45:20.202
feel free to wander this barren wasteland.

45:20.202 --> 45:23.264
Me and Zombie Girl,
we're going back to town

45:23.264 --> 45:25.237
for a couple of nice drinks.

45:25.237 --> 45:27.933
- Dagen, it's not what you think.

45:28.824 --> 45:32.961
- Your team is a failure, Marek.

45:34.515 --> 45:35.890
- He needs to know.

45:35.890 --> 45:37.603
- Know what?

45:39.253 --> 45:41.583
- Teela is inside of her.

45:41.583 --> 45:42.947
They're sharing the same body

45:42.947 --> 45:44.024
- No, it's my body.

45:44.024 --> 45:47.523
Somehow Teela controls me sometimes.

45:47.523 --> 45:52.523
- Thane, this is weird,
and sick, and twisted,

45:52.579 --> 45:54.468
and wrong, and Marek,

45:54.468 --> 45:57.725
quite frankly I'm surprised
you're playing along with it.

45:57.725 --> 45:58.820
- Stop holding her back.

45:58.820 --> 46:00.865
- Listen, Thane, just shut up about it.

46:00.865 --> 46:04.545
- Teela, it's me, Thane.
- What are you doing, stop!

46:04.545 --> 46:05.996
- Marek.

46:07.340 --> 46:09.946
- Hey! Stop it, leave her alone!
- Teela listen to me, we need you.

46:09.946 --> 46:11.245
Follow my voice.

46:11.245 --> 46:13.575
Teela, come!

46:14.682 --> 46:18.245
- Time is running out.

46:18.245 --> 46:21.447
Make haste, to the Temple.

46:21.447 --> 46:23.930
They're coming.

46:23.930 --> 46:27.588
Run for your lives.

46:27.588 --> 46:32.585
Run, run.

46:32.585 --> 46:35.028
- What have you done to her?

46:35.028 --> 46:36.329
- It's Teela.

46:36.329 --> 46:37.705
Her spirit is inside of her.

46:37.705 --> 46:38.921
Run, why?

46:38.921 --> 46:41.042
Why run?

46:41.042 --> 46:43.467
- Death.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.978
- I liked it better when she said run.

46:56.018 --> 46:58.535
- Thane, now that you figured
out how to talk to Teela,

46:58.535 --> 47:00.394
you think we could get Marek back?

47:06.928 --> 47:09.808
- Hang on!

47:10.718 --> 47:12.521
- What is it?

47:14.533 --> 47:17.148
- Faster Thane!

47:18.868 --> 47:20.866
Thane!

47:30.842 --> 47:32.667
- Thane!

47:44.009 --> 47:47.210
- Thane, they're coming, use the bottles!

48:02.918 --> 48:04.914
- Are they gone?

48:22.176 --> 48:24.170
Hang on!

49:44.597 --> 49:46.219
- Thane!

49:46.219 --> 49:49.167
Turn around, we lost Dagen!

50:04.621 --> 50:07.354
- You are brilliant!

50:07.354 --> 50:09.295
Come on!

50:15.634 --> 50:18.291
Come on, come on that's it!

50:18.291 --> 50:20.596
That's it, perfect, take my hand!

50:20.596 --> 50:23.636
My hand, come one!

50:23.636 --> 50:25.834
Thane, slow down!

50:25.834 --> 50:28.032
Take my!

50:30.172 --> 50:31.669
Thane!

50:31.669 --> 50:32.928
Thane, stop!

50:32.928 --> 50:34.645
We have to turn back!

50:34.645 --> 50:37.070
- No Thane, keep going!

50:37.070 --> 50:38.945
- Thane, you stop this thing!

50:38.945 --> 50:41.318
Stop!

50:42.721 --> 50:44.951
- There's nothing we can do.

50:55.556 --> 50:57.161
- Stop.

51:00.796 --> 51:02.940
- Accept your fate Szorlok,

51:02.940 --> 51:05.235
we are both here forever.

51:15.448 --> 51:19.276
Well, components are running low,

51:19.276 --> 51:21.854
and channeling is depleted.

51:23.342 --> 51:26.428
- Yes, soon there will
be no magical reserves

51:26.428 --> 51:28.346
for you to draw upon,

51:28.346 --> 51:31.601
and then you will die.

51:31.601 --> 51:35.484
- Whether I live or die doesn't matter.

51:35.484 --> 51:39.580
You and the Darkspore will
be stuck here forever.

51:39.580 --> 51:42.567
- It's strange to me you seem so certain.

51:42.567 --> 51:46.963
You cannot really be that stupid, can you?

51:46.963 --> 51:50.068
- Keep talking Szorlok,

51:50.068 --> 51:52.212
every moment that goes by,

51:52.212 --> 51:55.210
Marek is further from your grasp.

51:55.210 --> 51:57.792
- I need not grasp anything.

51:57.792 --> 52:01.175
She will come to me.

52:01.175 --> 52:04.761
Just as her mother did.

52:04.761 --> 52:06.841
- She's stronger than her mother.

52:09.888 --> 52:13.745
- Oh yes, I am counting on it.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.734
- Dust storm away to the West.

52:38.734 --> 52:41.331
It should just miss us.

52:42.884 --> 52:44.975
- How far to the Temple?

52:46.665 --> 52:48.916
- I don't know.

52:50.084 --> 52:52.463
- Could go on forever.

52:52.463 --> 52:55.264
We'll never find it, not
before we run out of fuel,

52:55.264 --> 52:57.121
water, or both.

52:57.121 --> 52:58.347
- Teela said she would take us there

52:58.347 --> 53:00.945
- Don't say her name.

53:05.628 --> 53:08.622
I'm sorry we couldn't go back.

53:08.622 --> 53:11.379
It was too late to save her.

53:14.888 --> 53:17.650
- Wait.

53:19.563 --> 53:22.039
- Dagen's friends are back.

53:31.879 --> 53:35.191
- I've never fully tested my range.

53:51.197 --> 53:53.804
- Don't waste it, wait for a good shot.

53:56.438 --> 53:58.406
- Never mind, fire away.

54:04.434 --> 54:07.174
- Is everything under control up there.

54:09.936 --> 54:12.178
- Don't listen to me, do whatever works.

54:12.178 --> 54:15.035
- You're too big of a
target, go get Dagen.

54:15.035 --> 54:16.657
- Good idea.

54:16.657 --> 54:18.732
Don't lose my shield.

54:32.953 --> 54:34.426
- How we doing?

54:34.426 --> 54:36.048
- I just missed you, that's all.

54:36.048 --> 54:37.072
- Ah.

54:44.008 --> 54:45.794
- Caia, now!

54:49.516 --> 54:52.269
- She has blackvine, very expensive.

54:52.269 --> 54:54.971
- See, that's what I've always said.

54:54.971 --> 54:57.193
We need more gold!

54:57.193 --> 54:59.681
- Faster you fools!

54:59.681 --> 55:01.713
- Come on.

55:05.582 --> 55:07.483
- Is that good or bad?

55:12.516 --> 55:14.489
- Based on past experience,

55:14.489 --> 55:16.174
I'd say it's always bad.

55:16.174 --> 55:17.849
Hey!

55:17.849 --> 55:21.057
- I'm not falling for that old trick.

55:29.423 --> 55:31.088
- Kill, kill, kill!

55:31.088 --> 55:33.127
No survivors, boys!

55:41.372 --> 55:43.883
Go!

55:48.791 --> 55:51.037
- It's her, it's the bloody Admiral.

56:17.058 --> 56:19.182
- Yes!

56:25.570 --> 56:26.920
- Oh brilliant!

56:26.920 --> 56:28.722
- Oh, fyke.

56:28.722 --> 56:31.692
Step aside, time to die.

56:38.332 --> 56:40.662
- Gotcha.

56:51.222 --> 56:54.576
Sweet mother of vengeance.

57:00.407 --> 57:03.476
- Admiral, Admiral.

57:07.066 --> 57:10.244
- Fyke, boys!

57:27.583 --> 57:32.436
- Tell me, if you're so convinced
we are stuck here to die,

57:32.436 --> 57:35.316
then why is it you care
if your pitiful team

57:35.316 --> 57:37.385
reaches their goal?

57:37.385 --> 57:40.777
I am defeated, nothing else matters,

57:40.777 --> 57:43.476
wouldn't you say?

57:43.476 --> 57:45.845
- Even one piece of the Darkspore

57:45.845 --> 57:49.420
has enough evil in it
to be worth protecting.

57:49.420 --> 57:53.528
- No, no that's not it.

57:54.368 --> 57:56.600
You know how this ends,

57:56.600 --> 58:00.227
and yet you still chose this path.

58:00.227 --> 58:03.525
Tell me, why?

58:03.525 --> 58:05.952
- Even if I told you,

58:06.852 --> 58:09.770
you could never understand my way.

58:09.770 --> 58:13.563
That is why you will fail in the end.

58:16.556 --> 58:19.810
- No, I can see now that I merely

58:19.810 --> 58:23.610
overestimated your intellect.

58:23.610 --> 58:26.383
Your plan is ill conceived.

58:26.383 --> 58:30.205
Which you will soon discover.

58:30.205 --> 58:34.317
- Then go on, what are you waiting for?

58:49.438 --> 58:52.024
- Marek.

58:53.692 --> 58:57.086
You still, you still owe me a kiss.

59:02.136 --> 59:04.612
- Shh, hey don't say that.

59:07.402 --> 59:10.163
You're not dying.

59:24.678 --> 59:25.713
- Marek.

59:25.713 --> 59:27.926
- No.

59:29.320 --> 59:31.145
Dagen.

59:34.665 --> 59:36.897
Dagen.

59:36.897 --> 59:38.817
Degan!

59:38.817 --> 59:40.630
Stop!

59:40.630 --> 59:42.497
Dagen!

59:52.526 --> 59:54.235
Teela!

59:54.235 --> 59:56.557
Teela, help him!

59:56.557 --> 59:59.338
Teela, heal him!

59:59.338 --> 01:00:02.698
- Oh Marek, she can't bring him back.

01:00:09.183 --> 01:00:11.103
- Teela help him,

01:00:11.103 --> 01:00:13.440
or I'll hurt Thane!

01:00:15.187 --> 01:00:17.880
Don't make me do it!

01:00:21.395 --> 01:00:22.873
Dagen.

01:00:36.837 --> 01:00:38.813
- What happened?

01:00:38.813 --> 01:00:41.567
- She made Teela bring you back.

01:00:41.567 --> 01:00:44.506
It may have been too much for her.

01:00:47.371 --> 01:00:51.344
- I was dead, I was dead.

01:00:53.088 --> 01:00:55.629
- We have to get Marek to that temple.

01:00:55.629 --> 01:00:58.989
She can't go on with Teela inside of her.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:02.802
It's going to kill her, or me.

01:01:05.614 --> 01:01:08.835
- Marek, It's me, it's me, yes.
- Dagen.

01:01:10.745 --> 01:01:14.150
- You managed to keep
me around a bit longer.

01:01:17.303 --> 01:01:19.223
- Don't explain.

01:01:19.223 --> 01:01:21.729
- Explain what?

01:01:23.059 --> 01:01:26.658
- She's willing to sacrifice
anything to bring you back.

01:01:27.828 --> 01:01:29.382
That's all.

01:01:37.306 --> 01:01:39.552
It's probably just the wind.

01:01:39.552 --> 01:01:41.792
- You don't think those demons could

01:01:41.792 --> 01:01:44.011
run through that storm do you?

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:48.240
- They don't seem to stop
at much of anything else.

01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:53.325
- Mind if we join you?

01:02:02.464 --> 01:02:05.616
The artifact, let's have it.

01:02:31.014 --> 01:02:34.790
- So that's what brings people
back from the dead, huh?

01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:37.287
Is that how you got your thief back?

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:39.795
- It doesn't raise the dead to the living,

01:02:39.795 --> 01:02:42.196
it turns them undead.

01:02:42.196 --> 01:02:46.862
- Oh, well that sounds bad.

01:02:46.862 --> 01:02:48.839
You know, that reminds
me of that one time.

01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:50.323
- How do you use it?

01:02:50.323 --> 01:02:53.684
- You don't, it uses you.

01:02:53.684 --> 01:02:56.030
It's a piece of the Lich Kings heart,

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:59.241
and it's power can only
be used by a necromancer.

01:02:59.241 --> 01:03:00.905
Like me.

01:03:00.905 --> 01:03:03.426
- Hammerhead's no necromancer.

01:03:03.426 --> 01:03:05.261
- He'll trade it to a necromancer,

01:03:05.261 --> 01:03:08.151
for the Iron Crown of the Dwarves.

01:03:09.021 --> 01:03:12.063
- I've known Hammerhead a
long time, he's no fool.

01:03:12.063 --> 01:03:14.017
- He's no fool,

01:03:15.787 --> 01:03:18.331
but he may not believe there's
any way to stop Szorlok,

01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:21.212
so he'll profit any way he can.

01:03:21.212 --> 01:03:25.032
- Yes, that is his way.

01:03:25.032 --> 01:03:27.026
- Know this.

01:03:27.026 --> 01:03:31.144
The Darkspore is a
weapon with one purpose.

01:03:31.144 --> 01:03:32.786
Death.

01:03:32.786 --> 01:03:35.390
If Szorlok gets that last piece,

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:37.226
nothing will matter.

01:03:37.226 --> 01:03:40.917
Not your gold, not
Hammerhead's crown, nothing.

01:03:43.541 --> 01:03:45.077
What's so funny?

01:03:45.077 --> 01:03:48.831
- Your dedication to Gojun's crusade.

01:03:48.831 --> 01:03:51.713
- We can't let Szorlok get the Darkspore.

01:03:51.713 --> 01:03:53.548
We're all responsible for it.

01:03:53.548 --> 01:03:55.692
- That's your quest, not ours.

01:03:55.692 --> 01:03:58.252
- We're mercenaries, true enough,

01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:00.908
but we never take work
we don't believe in.

01:04:00.908 --> 01:04:03.650
Hammerhead's ways may not
be in line with yours,

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:06.233
but what would you do that's any better?

01:04:06.233 --> 01:04:08.558
- We're taking it to a
temple to keep it safe.

01:04:08.558 --> 01:04:11.929
Anything's better than
letting Szorlok have it.

01:04:11.929 --> 01:04:15.534
- I'm done talking, it's settled.

01:04:15.534 --> 01:04:17.369
- You're making a mistake.

01:04:17.369 --> 01:04:18.969
- Our only mistake is letting you live.

01:04:18.969 --> 01:04:20.537
If I had it my way, you'd all be dead

01:04:20.537 --> 01:04:23.276
with a lot less discussion about it!

01:04:25.831 --> 01:04:28.082
- We'll drop your weapons at a safe place,

01:04:28.082 --> 01:04:29.991
but don't bother coming after us.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:33.266
We ride much faster than
this contraption ever could.

01:04:42.442 --> 01:04:45.077
You have too much doubt in yourself.

01:04:45.077 --> 01:04:47.702
Make your own path.

01:04:47.702 --> 01:04:51.169
If you do wrong, at least
you made a real choice.

01:04:52.749 --> 01:04:55.933
Don't go wrong following someone else.

01:04:59.684 --> 01:05:01.668
- Don't cry Redthorns.

01:05:01.668 --> 01:05:04.451
You're lucky to be alive.

01:05:19.013 --> 01:05:20.794
- We have to help them.

01:05:20.794 --> 01:05:21.712
- What?

01:05:21.712 --> 01:05:24.229
- Come on.

01:05:24.229 --> 01:05:26.465
- Can't we just watch for a minute?

01:06:03.915 --> 01:06:05.675
- Marek.

01:06:15.298 --> 01:06:16.439
- Go on you fools.

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:20.398
You owe us nothing, get
away while you still can!

01:06:20.398 --> 01:06:23.152
We can't win, not without
Thorsten and Caia!

01:06:42.684 --> 01:06:43.784
- Dagen, switch!

01:06:43.784 --> 01:06:45.063
- I will not switch!

01:06:45.063 --> 01:06:46.651
I was dead, I have earned the right

01:06:46.651 --> 01:06:49.244
to fight the thing that only has one arm!

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:53.223
Thane, Thane, switch!

01:07:51.186 --> 01:07:54.099
- Are we really going to do this?

01:07:54.099 --> 01:07:56.170
- What's the plan?

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:57.739
- I'm going to take the Darkspore

01:07:57.739 --> 01:08:01.036
to the Temple of the Owl,
and you can either help me,

01:08:01.036 --> 01:08:03.969
or you can die trying to stop me.

01:08:06.493 --> 01:08:09.030
- That was some quick thinking,

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.773
but your team needs a leader,

01:08:13.773 --> 01:08:16.738
and you keep waiting for
somebody to give you the answers.

01:08:16.738 --> 01:08:20.162
Hammerhead, Gojun, they
won't lead your team.

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.653
Their time has past.

01:08:28.036 --> 01:08:29.484
- Thank you.

01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:31.638
- Ha, don't thank me.

01:08:31.638 --> 01:08:34.935
We may all yet live to be enemies again.

01:08:34.935 --> 01:08:36.625
Let's go.

01:08:43.246 --> 01:08:45.582
- There's our guide!

01:08:45.582 --> 01:08:48.046
I knew she wouldn't let us down.

01:09:21.627 --> 01:09:24.238
- There's nothing left to channel.

01:09:26.603 --> 01:09:29.680
Looks like we're down
to brute strength now.

01:09:32.823 --> 01:09:36.365
- You always had me
out-matched physically,

01:09:36.365 --> 01:09:41.194
but I never had too much
trouble outsmarting you.

01:09:47.202 --> 01:09:50.019
- You always were a cheater.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:55.019
- There are no cheaters, only
the victors and the dead.

01:10:09.729 --> 01:10:11.671
- You all right?

01:10:13.107 --> 01:10:14.963
- He was right, you know.

01:10:14.963 --> 01:10:16.702
- About what?

01:10:16.702 --> 01:10:18.505
- I'm not a leader.

01:10:18.505 --> 01:10:20.404
- Really?

01:10:20.404 --> 01:10:23.037
Why do I keep following you then?

01:10:23.037 --> 01:10:26.930
Why does Thane keep following you?

01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:28.679
- I don't know.

01:10:28.679 --> 01:10:32.446
Maybe because you like pain and suffering?

01:10:32.446 --> 01:10:34.134
- Don't jest.

01:10:34.134 --> 01:10:36.472
Not like this.

01:10:36.472 --> 01:10:40.593
We follow you for the same
reason Gojun Pye does.

01:10:40.593 --> 01:10:42.140
- What?

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:46.312
- Heck, Gojun doesn't
see you as a follower.

01:10:46.312 --> 01:10:50.046
He's looking to you for answers.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:52.808
He believes that you can
succeed where he can't.

01:10:52.808 --> 01:10:56.030
- Don't be stupid, Gojun is
more powerful than I ever.

01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:57.289
- Do you really believe it's still

01:10:57.289 --> 01:10:59.817
about being more powerful?

01:10:59.817 --> 01:11:03.455
It's never been that way
with us, it never will be.

01:11:03.455 --> 01:11:06.350
That's not how we're
going to defeat Szorlok.

01:11:07.294 --> 01:11:09.382
- Then how?

01:11:09.382 --> 01:11:12.246
What do we do?

01:11:14.452 --> 01:11:16.734
- Don't honestly know.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.044
But I do believe, that
when the time comes,

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:24.136
you'll have the answer.

01:11:25.688 --> 01:11:29.989
You always do, that's why we follow you.

01:11:29.989 --> 01:11:32.619
'Cause we believe in you.

01:11:34.929 --> 01:11:37.699
- How are you so hopeful
all of the sudden?

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:42.911
- Well I died,

01:11:42.911 --> 01:11:45.665
and I was brought back to life

01:11:45.665 --> 01:11:48.031
by a beautiful girl
possessed by a goddess,

01:11:48.031 --> 01:11:53.031
so the worst has to be behind me, right?

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:13.853
- Impossible.

01:12:13.853 --> 01:12:15.915
What's the world coming to
when you can't kill a man

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:17.717
and be sure he'll stay dead?

01:12:17.717 --> 01:12:20.609
- He's a reprobate, he's got no shame.

01:12:20.609 --> 01:12:24.048
A downright disingenuous.

01:12:28.265 --> 01:12:30.451
- Watch 'em.

01:12:48.254 --> 01:12:51.435
- This is holy ground.

01:12:51.435 --> 01:12:54.286
Leave the wagon here.

01:12:56.846 --> 01:12:59.587
- Thane, stop the wagon.

01:12:59.587 --> 01:13:03.091
This is it, we're here.

01:13:34.508 --> 01:13:37.356
- That's it, fight me
with all your strength.

01:13:44.867 --> 01:13:49.842
Good, now, let me show you
the error of your ways,

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:54.842
as I return to our world and
usher in a new age or order,

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:58.383
my order.

01:13:58.383 --> 01:14:02.278
- There's no magic, you can't go back.

01:14:02.278 --> 01:14:07.278
- Yes, because, how did yo put it?

01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:11.298
There is no living
thing for me to feed on.

01:14:11.298 --> 01:14:15.598
Well there is one living thing.

01:14:22.183 --> 01:14:24.263
You're too tired, old friend.

01:14:24.263 --> 01:14:27.348
You've already used the
last of your strength.

01:14:27.348 --> 01:14:32.348
Now, give me your life
force, you cannot resist.

01:14:56.349 --> 01:14:59.591
- No, it can't be gone.

01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:01.152
No!

01:15:01.152 --> 01:15:04.140
- The closer we get, the weaker I become.

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:06.230
- If it gets much worse,
we are turning back.

01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:08.813
I don't care if you think.
- There!

01:15:19.162 --> 01:15:22.339
We're coming, Teela!

01:15:29.589 --> 01:15:32.043
- Admiral.

01:15:32.043 --> 01:15:33.045
- What?

01:15:33.045 --> 01:15:34.466
- They've disappeared.

01:15:34.466 --> 01:15:36.331
They're gone.

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:37.505
- What are you talking about,

01:15:37.505 --> 01:15:38.892
what are you talking about!?!

01:15:38.892 --> 01:15:41.025
I told you to keep an eye on them,

01:15:41.025 --> 01:15:42.945
and you can't find them from up here?!

01:15:42.945 --> 01:15:44.449
I'll throw you overboard,

01:15:44.449 --> 01:15:47.302
and you'll find them from down there!

01:15:51.929 --> 01:15:54.437
- I know they were somewhere,

01:15:54.437 --> 01:15:57.140
somewhere around here.

01:16:01.063 --> 01:16:03.900
- There, there it is!

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:05.706
Teela, we're here.

01:16:16.674 --> 01:16:18.829
Friend or foe?

01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:21.718
- Le's ask him.

01:16:21.718 --> 01:16:24.058
Hey, you there!

01:16:25.442 --> 01:16:28.204
We're friends with Teela.

01:16:28.204 --> 01:16:30.802
You know, Teela?

01:16:31.832 --> 01:16:33.357
See how friendly he is?

01:16:33.357 --> 01:16:34.477
Any ideas?

01:16:34.477 --> 01:16:35.576
- Don't show fear.

01:16:35.576 --> 01:16:38.291
- You should have said that first.

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:48.992
- Kill, kill, kill.

01:17:03.246 --> 01:17:05.166
Ah, yes!

01:17:18.534 --> 01:17:20.439
- I'll get him sir.

01:17:43.016 --> 01:17:44.691
- Get me closer,

01:17:44.691 --> 01:17:48.458
I want them to see my face,
as they die by my hand.

01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:50.218
- Yes.

01:18:45.374 --> 01:18:46.722
- Marek?

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:49.620
Marek, can you fight?

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.879
Markek?

01:18:50.879 --> 01:18:52.832
Thane, tell your lady
we need our wizard back

01:18:52.832 --> 01:18:56.480
or this is going to be over very quickly.
- Need a little help.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.520
- Whoever you are, you need to help us,

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.038
or we are going to die!

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.833
- You!

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:25.492
- That's right, look up,

01:19:25.492 --> 01:19:29.218
and see the end of your
insignificant little lives.

01:19:33.457 --> 01:19:37.651
- Either way, you lose.

01:20:05.712 --> 01:20:08.427
- Yes, all mine.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:16.473
I feast on the soul of
the mighty Gojun Pye.

01:20:16.508 --> 01:20:21.034
The sweet succulence of victory.

01:20:33.945 --> 01:20:35.870
- Gojun.

01:20:37.328 --> 01:20:41.195
- You served your purpose, old friend.

01:20:45.650 --> 01:20:47.624
- No!

01:20:58.445 --> 01:21:00.665
- Bloody warlock, again!

01:21:00.665 --> 01:21:03.070
- He left me no choice.

01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:07.780
In his last moments,

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.378
I looked into his mind.

01:21:10.378 --> 01:21:13.359
You, were his final thought.

01:21:13.359 --> 01:21:18.229
- If I have my way, I'll
be your dying thought too.

01:21:30.306 --> 01:21:32.553
- You murder for pleasure.

01:21:32.553 --> 01:21:35.599
- Only to fulfill my rightful purpose.

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:39.077
- Fyke him, he's pissin'
all over my party.

01:21:39.077 --> 01:21:40.982
Make it a double.

01:21:40.982 --> 01:21:44.045
- I'll take back what is mine.

01:21:44.045 --> 01:21:46.263
Stolen from me by betrayal,

01:21:46.263 --> 01:21:50.460
and finally returned to
its rightful possessor.

01:21:51.671 --> 01:21:54.695
Yes, come to me.

01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:04.287
- Fyke!

01:22:14.561 --> 01:22:16.336
- Run!

01:22:17.665 --> 01:22:20.386
- You cannot hide from me, Marek!

01:22:20.386 --> 01:22:22.860
There is no escape!

01:24:15.930 --> 01:24:18.703
- Teela?

01:24:18.703 --> 01:24:21.653
- Touch me not.

01:24:21.653 --> 01:24:23.340
- Teela?

01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:26.860
- Teela is with me.

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:29.134
We are the goddess Ana-Sett,

01:24:29.134 --> 01:24:34.134
reborn to dwell in the
world among mortals.

01:24:38.201 --> 01:24:40.122
- What about the Darkspore?

01:24:40.122 --> 01:24:42.021
How will you help us?

01:24:42.021 --> 01:24:44.372
You lead us here, for what?

01:24:45.242 --> 01:24:48.711
- You may impart the Darkspore to me.

01:24:48.711 --> 01:24:50.290
- But can you keep it safe?

01:24:50.290 --> 01:24:51.592
- Not here.

01:24:51.592 --> 01:24:54.569
I will fly from the
temple, away from Szorlok.

01:24:54.569 --> 01:24:58.109
- Szorlok, he'll break through.

01:25:04.319 --> 01:25:06.898
More running and hiding.

01:25:06.898 --> 01:25:09.404
- It's what Gojun Pye wanted us to do.

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:12.073
It's why we're here.

01:25:17.023 --> 01:25:18.996
- It doesn't feel right.

01:25:18.996 --> 01:25:21.162
It's what we've always done.

01:25:21.162 --> 01:25:23.723
- We have no other choice.

01:25:23.723 --> 01:25:28.683
- Unless, Ana-Sett, where
is the Hammer of Tek?

01:25:28.683 --> 01:25:30.824
Is it real?

01:25:30.824 --> 01:25:34.589
- The Hammer is real, but it is lost.

01:25:34.589 --> 01:25:36.883
- You wouldn't give
Szorlok the last piece,

01:25:36.883 --> 01:25:39.944
not for a faint hope on some magic hammer.

01:25:39.944 --> 01:25:42.483
Gojun Pye wanted you to
give it to the goddess.

01:25:42.483 --> 01:25:45.929
- We'll never beat Szorlok
unless we stop running.

01:25:45.929 --> 01:25:47.988
Gojun is gone.

01:25:47.988 --> 01:25:51.001
I can't follow his lead anymore.

01:26:03.312 --> 01:26:08.312
- So, you would entrust
the Darkspore to Ana-Sett.

01:26:08.388 --> 01:26:11.247
She cannot hide forever.

01:26:11.247 --> 01:26:14.170
I will hunt her down.

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:17.746
I will make her suffer
as any goddess should.

01:26:17.746 --> 01:26:21.415
- I didn't come here to
listen to more hollow mockery.

01:26:22.935 --> 01:26:25.843
I'm here to make an offer.

01:26:25.843 --> 01:26:28.970
You have the Iron Crown?

01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:32.032
Yes, I know of Hammerhead's treachery,

01:26:32.032 --> 01:26:35.834
but are you bold enough to
make the same trade, with me?

01:26:44.056 --> 01:26:46.607
- You cannot fool me Marek.

01:26:46.607 --> 01:26:49.819
You seek the Hammer of Tek,

01:26:49.819 --> 01:26:53.360
and you would wish to destroy
the greatest magic of all time

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.582
and forsake your destiny as a necromancer.

01:26:56.582 --> 01:26:58.160
- Call it what you will,

01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.911
but I'm letting you
choose your own downfall.

01:27:01.911 --> 01:27:06.911
Give me the crown, and you
can have the Darkspore now,

01:27:07.368 --> 01:27:10.749
or you can chase Ana-Sett
the world over for it,

01:27:10.749 --> 01:27:13.042
and keep the Crown.

01:27:13.042 --> 01:27:16.621
Who knows, maybe you'd make
a good Kind of the Dwarves?

01:27:18.249 --> 01:27:21.587
- It's fitting you would
bring me this piece.

01:27:21.587 --> 01:27:24.713
Your mother once brought
me that same shard.

01:27:24.713 --> 01:27:26.367
- You lie!

01:27:26.367 --> 01:27:28.961
- You know what's true.

01:27:28.961 --> 01:27:32.923
The Darkspore flows
through your very veins.

01:27:32.923 --> 01:27:35.462
She clutched the Darkspore to here chest

01:27:35.462 --> 01:27:37.800
as you grew in her belly.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.696
Month, after month, you drew
in the Darkspore's power.

01:27:42.696 --> 01:27:45.043
Swam in its shadow.

01:27:45.043 --> 01:27:47.817
- Make your choice.

01:28:06.638 --> 01:28:09.032
- At last.

01:28:32.175 --> 01:28:36.250
- I am death!

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:40.015
I am the Lich King reborn!

01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:44.053
Witness the birth of a god!

01:28:44.923 --> 01:28:48.379
You foolish child.

01:28:48.379 --> 01:28:53.245
You have sealed the fate of
everything that draws breath,

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:58.245
so begins the Age of Death.

01:29:11.332 --> 01:29:16.165
- Doesn't look too bad so
far, this Age of Death.

01:29:21.635 --> 01:29:26.635
- You have made
an unexpected choice, Marek.

01:29:27.053 --> 01:29:29.389
The Lich King will not delay.

01:29:29.389 --> 01:29:30.714
His aremies will rise from

01:29:30.714 --> 01:29:32.986
the graves of ancient battlefields.

01:29:32.986 --> 01:29:35.706
They will march on the
lands of the living.

01:29:35.706 --> 01:29:38.236
If you seek the Hammer,
you must make haste.

01:29:38.236 --> 01:29:40.685
- We will, where do we start?

01:29:40.685 --> 01:29:43.587
I only know the Hammer was
used by Tek, god of the forge.

01:29:43.587 --> 01:29:46.126
- When Tek battled the
Lich King Vekru Nom,

01:29:46.126 --> 01:29:49.594
he was stuck down at the
hill known as Battlegrave.

01:29:49.594 --> 01:29:53.755
Tek fell to his death, swallowed
deep in the Underworld.

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:56.390
The realm of the dead.

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:59.890
He took the Hammer
there, and cannot return.

01:29:59.890 --> 01:30:02.934
- There's a first time for everything.

01:30:07.976 --> 01:30:10.079
- I'm staying.

01:30:11.195 --> 01:30:14.630
- That's not exactly Teela, Thane.

01:30:14.630 --> 01:30:17.072
- It is, and it isn't,

01:30:17.072 --> 01:30:20.732
but I dedicate myself to her,

01:30:20.732 --> 01:30:23.607
my life and my sword.

01:30:26.557 --> 01:30:29.720
- Rise, Paladin.

01:30:39.699 --> 01:30:42.397
- I haven't forgotten, I am here.

01:30:42.397 --> 01:30:46.274
Thane, I am yours as long as you are mine.

01:30:47.325 --> 01:30:50.167
- There she is, Teela my love.

01:30:52.061 --> 01:30:54.141
That's Teela alright.

01:30:54.141 --> 01:30:57.225
- Teela, I'm sorry for what I did.

01:30:57.225 --> 01:30:59.947
- Oh, don't be sorry.

01:30:59.947 --> 01:31:03.125
Yours is the hardest path and the darkest,

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:06.405
and it will grow darker
still before the end.

01:31:06.405 --> 01:31:08.238
- Thane,

01:31:10.868 --> 01:31:12.532
have a good time.

01:31:12.532 --> 01:31:15.136
You deserve it.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:17.444
- Watch out for her.

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:24.688
- You are my first, and truest friend.

01:31:25.995 --> 01:31:30.995
- Marek, I have always believed in you.

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:35.078
If anyone will do it, you will.

01:31:36.289 --> 01:31:39.150
- Thane and I will gather
resistance to slow Szorlok.

01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:43.108
We will warn the people,
save as many lives as we can.

01:31:43.108 --> 01:31:47.821
- Dagen and I will get that
Hammer, or we'll die trying.

01:32:02.718 --> 01:32:05.182
I've made a terrible mistake.

01:32:05.182 --> 01:32:08.318
I've traded the fate of the
world for this hunk of metal.

01:32:08.318 --> 01:32:11.241
- Someone had to choose, Marek.

01:32:11.241 --> 01:32:13.248
- Why me?

01:32:13.248 --> 01:32:15.329
Why not someone else?

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:18.027
- Because you're the
only one crazy enough,

01:32:18.027 --> 01:32:20.710
to choose the impossible.

01:32:25.648 --> 01:32:30.648
- Just like that, Thane
and Teela, gone in a flash.

01:32:31.555 --> 01:32:33.233
You know, they're probably
at some gloriously

01:32:33.233 --> 01:32:35.955
seedy tavern by now, sipping drinks.

01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:40.782
You've teleported before
Marek, what gives?

01:32:40.782 --> 01:32:42.969
- Her magic's not like mine.

01:32:42.969 --> 01:32:44.590
You have to be sanctified.

01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:47.151
- Well in that case, you can keep it.

01:32:47.151 --> 01:32:49.054
I'd rather walk.

01:32:52.068 --> 01:32:57.068
How funny would it be, if we
died of thirst after all this.

01:32:58.854 --> 01:32:59.824
- Stop.

01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:01.531
- Stop what?

01:33:01.531 --> 01:33:03.813
- Talking.

01:35:06.883 --> 01:35:09.905
♫ On the banks of the snowy river

01:35:09.905 --> 01:35:12.966
♫ my love and I were merrily wed

01:35:12.966 --> 01:35:16.221
♫ as we felt for a fleeting moment

01:35:16.221 --> 01:35:20.957
♫ that our joy would never end

01:35:22.747 --> 01:35:25.927
♫ for our hearts were bound together

01:35:25.927 --> 01:35:29.138
♫ stronger than an iron wall

01:35:29.138 --> 01:35:32.306
♫ but the sound of the distant battle

01:35:32.306 --> 01:35:36.086
♫ they all meant to hear the call

01:35:36.086 --> 01:35:39.063
♫ stranded between love and duty

01:35:39.063 --> 01:35:42.242
♫ stranded what is there for me

01:35:42.242 --> 01:35:45.463
♫ stranded between love and duty

01:35:45.463 --> 01:35:50.098
♫ stranded what is there for me

01:35:51.662 --> 01:35:54.809
♫ torn between my solemn beauty

01:35:54.809 --> 01:35:57.852
♫ and the one thing that mattered more

01:35:57.852 --> 01:36:01.009
♫ I could not forsake my beauty

01:36:01.009 --> 01:36:04.664
♫ but to face an ugly war

01:36:04.664 --> 01:36:07.801
♫ stranded

01:36:07.801 --> 01:36:11.103
♫ stranded

01:36:11.103 --> 01:36:14.303
♫ stranded

01:36:14.303 --> 01:36:16.028
♫ stranded

01:36:16.028 --> 01:36:19.945
♫ what is there for me

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:30.677
♫ so we stowed away by starlight

01:36:30.677 --> 01:36:35.158
♫ and we sailed until we were free

01:36:35.158 --> 01:36:39.820
♫ but at times when I look at the mirror

01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:44.820
♫ a coward stares back at me

01:36:48.167 --> 01:36:51.048
♫ stranded between love and duty

01:36:51.048 --> 01:36:54.102
