WEBVTT

00:01.222 --> 00:03.735
- Previously on Wrecked...
- Danny, get away from me.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.204
I'm not gonna leave you.
You're my friend.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.748
I am not your friend! We are
just stuck here together!

00:07.749 --> 00:10.750
- Did you eat someone out there?
- I was just trying to survive.

00:10.785 --> 00:13.385
No one can ever know about this.
They'll think you're a monster.

00:13.421 --> 00:15.454
You just can't stand the
idea of me being in charge.

00:15.490 --> 00:17.824
In charge of what? You're
playing make-believe here.

00:17.859 --> 00:19.826
- Steve's gone insane.
- I know.

00:19.861 --> 00:21.628
You have to get me off this island.

00:21.663 --> 00:23.696
- What do I do?
- What about Owen's boat?

00:23.732 --> 00:25.231
- Emma!
- What?

00:25.266 --> 00:27.667
Oh, my God. There she is! Emma!

00:27.702 --> 00:30.569
I'll be fine! Go back! I'm sorry!

00:30.605 --> 00:32.570
- I got to go back for Danny.
- I'm going with you.

00:33.312 --> 00:35.341
Let's go save this island.

00:36.808 --> 00:38.778
Look! They're getting away!

00:42.253 --> 00:43.941
Holy shit!

00:43.942 --> 00:44.884
Oh, my God!

00:45.136 --> 00:46.936
The son of a bitch shot me!

00:49.707 --> 00:53.009
No one else leaves my island!

00:53.044 --> 00:54.911
Do you hear me?!

00:54.946 --> 00:57.013
No one!

00:57.048 --> 00:58.647
Todd! Todd!

00:58.683 --> 01:01.117
- Step back!
- Todd!

01:01.152 --> 01:02.718
What are you doing?!

01:02.754 --> 01:04.720
I'm protecting our new life here!

01:04.756 --> 01:06.422
Don't you see?

01:06.457 --> 01:07.723
This is it!

01:07.759 --> 01:10.526
It's never gonna get better than this!

01:10.561 --> 01:12.195
There's nothing for us out there!

01:13.706 --> 01:15.564
We're home!

01:15.600 --> 01:16.866
Guys!

01:16.902 --> 01:18.501
I heard a commotion!

01:18.536 --> 01:21.570
I wanted to make sure everyone was okay.

01:21.606 --> 01:23.639
Oh, my God, I'm out of breath.

01:23.674 --> 01:25.741
Running in the sand
really got me there.

01:25.777 --> 01:27.543
I'm sorry.

01:27.578 --> 01:29.845
Listen, I know I said I
wasn't gonna come back,

01:29.881 --> 01:31.547
and yet, here's Danny, right?

01:31.582 --> 01:34.150
I am so sorry, everyone.

01:34.185 --> 01:38.087
Oh, Steve has my gun.

01:44.190 --> 01:44.794
Danny.

01:44.829 --> 01:47.230
Really good to see you, Steve.
How are things?

01:49.000 --> 01:49.914
Please don't shoot me.

01:53.138 --> 01:57.907
People of the island,
before us swings a traitor.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.475
Any last words?

01:59.510 --> 02:00.944
Owen was right about you.

02:00.979 --> 02:02.145
You're a monster.

02:02.180 --> 02:04.547
You're a piece of shit!

02:04.582 --> 02:06.749
There are two types of
people in this world...

02:06.784 --> 02:08.550
People who are good, and...

02:08.586 --> 02:10.820
You know what? Forget it.
Last-word privileges revoked.

02:10.854 --> 02:12.055
This is bullshit!

02:12.090 --> 02:14.490
Guys, we don't have to
take this from him.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.725
We can fight back.

02:16.761 --> 02:17.927
Danny's right!

02:17.963 --> 02:19.628
Steve should go in the pit.

02:19.664 --> 02:20.997
Careful, Jess.

02:21.032 --> 02:22.231
You shot Todd.

02:22.267 --> 02:24.834
You shoot someone, you go into the pit.

02:24.869 --> 02:26.936
Those were your rules, Steve.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.171
Grab him!

02:29.774 --> 02:33.176
S-Seriously, guys? No one?

02:33.211 --> 02:35.511
Grab me!

02:36.548 --> 02:38.848
Come on, guys! Oh, come on!

02:38.883 --> 02:40.749
Yeah, okay, real big men

02:40.785 --> 02:42.551
listening to the dick with the gun!

02:42.587 --> 02:43.752
God!

02:43.788 --> 02:45.521
- Get off of me!
- Jess, you're next.

02:45.556 --> 02:46.889
You can't do this, Steve!

02:46.924 --> 02:49.725
Chet, Chet, help me!

02:49.760 --> 02:51.027
Help me, Chet!

02:51.062 --> 02:53.863
I know you can hear me,
you stupid hippie!

02:53.898 --> 02:55.664
You know what? Grab him, too.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.967
- Wait, what? I didn't do anything.
- You're weird.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.902
But... I can't go in the pit, man.

02:59.937 --> 03:02.897
- I don't... I don't... I don't
care anything about her! - What?!

03:02.898 --> 03:04.773
- You want me to throw her
in the pit for you? - Chet!

03:04.809 --> 03:07.543
- I'll throw her in the pit right
now, Steve! - Are you insane?

03:07.578 --> 03:10.046
Grab him. You're gonna have
to catch me first, man.

03:10.552 --> 03:11.647
They caught me!

03:11.682 --> 03:13.082
Oh, they caught me so fast!

03:13.118 --> 03:15.051
- Steve!
- Steve!

03:15.086 --> 03:16.552
Please don't throw me into the pit!

03:16.587 --> 03:18.854
Please don't throw me into the pit!

03:25.997 --> 03:27.730
I thought of the actor's name.

03:27.765 --> 03:29.899
It's Billy Zane. It
was Billy Zane, guys.

03:29.934 --> 03:31.234
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

03:31.269 --> 03:33.769
Billy goddamn Zane.

03:39.077 --> 03:41.577
Should we meeting out
in the open like this?

03:41.612 --> 03:43.913
I mean, we can't be too
careful these days.

03:43.948 --> 03:45.114
It's fine.

03:45.150 --> 03:46.349
We're all just guarding the pit.

03:46.384 --> 03:48.617
Yeah. Who would even be watching us?

03:48.653 --> 03:50.753
What happened here?

03:50.788 --> 03:53.089
I swear to God, I'm gonna
throttle that ginger.

03:53.124 --> 03:56.025
Oh, God! Oh, my abs.

03:57.262 --> 03:58.694
You guys, I just saw the pit!

03:58.729 --> 04:00.263
He's got like a dozen people down there.

04:00.298 --> 04:01.697
He's lost his goddamn mind.

04:01.732 --> 04:02.965
- Is Danny in there?
- And Jess?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.201
This is so messed up.

04:06.271 --> 04:08.871
So what are we gonna do?

04:08.906 --> 04:10.139
We need to make these people see

04:10.175 --> 04:12.108
the reality of the situation, okay?

04:12.143 --> 04:13.776
This is our home now.

04:13.811 --> 04:16.144
And why would we want to
go back anyway, right?

04:16.180 --> 04:18.846
I mean, Karen, you're Vice
President of the island!

04:18.882 --> 04:20.616
I would die for you, Steve.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.751
That's what I'm talking about!

04:22.787 --> 04:25.288
And, Pack, you certainly can't go back.

04:25.323 --> 04:29.925
You know, 'cause...
Block your ears, Karen.

04:29.961 --> 04:31.160
You ate a guy!

04:31.196 --> 04:32.661
Hey, I know Steve!

04:32.697 --> 04:33.896
Come on, you don't have
to say it out loud!

04:33.931 --> 04:35.131
So what? She can't hear me.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.300
Look, watch this. Karen.

04:37.335 --> 04:38.801
Karen. Karen.

04:38.836 --> 04:40.103
- Karen!
- Karen.

04:40.138 --> 04:41.637
- Karen!
- Karen.

04:42.719 --> 04:43.639
See?

04:43.674 --> 04:44.940
All I'm saying is if you go back home,

04:44.976 --> 04:46.275
you're gonna be treated like a freak.

04:48.063 --> 04:49.945
- I can't go back.
- Exactly!

04:51.145 --> 04:52.248
Thank you!

04:52.916 --> 04:57.320
Guys, we need to make sure these
people realize the truth.

04:57.355 --> 05:00.089
We're here for good.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.757
We're saved!

05:01.792 --> 05:03.226
There's a ship!

05:06.174 --> 05:07.830
It's a ship!

05:07.865 --> 05:09.064
We're saved!

05:09.100 --> 05:10.266
We're saved!

05:10.301 --> 05:12.801
We're saved!

05:13.839 --> 05:15.671
Did Turdhole just say there's a ship?

05:15.706 --> 05:18.073
Mother of God.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.308
It's a ship.

05:21.542 --> 05:25.077
- Yeah!
- Yes!

05:26.155 --> 05:28.610
Oh, God! Oh, God!

05:29.304 --> 05:31.438
Oh, God! It's a ship!

05:31.474 --> 05:34.107
We're saved!

05:34.142 --> 05:37.344
We're saved!

05:37.380 --> 05:39.580
Steve, what should we do?

05:39.615 --> 05:41.314
Sh-Should we get the flare gun?

05:41.350 --> 05:43.149
No. We're not signaling that ship.

05:43.185 --> 05:46.089
What? But... why?

05:46.090 --> 05:48.024
I-It's getting away.

05:48.059 --> 05:49.492
Don't get any ideas.

05:49.528 --> 05:51.994
We're not leaving the island.

05:53.092 --> 05:54.478
What are you talking about?

05:54.479 --> 05:57.233
Turdhole, we're not leaving!

05:57.268 --> 05:59.068
Yes.

05:59.103 --> 06:01.762
Yes, we are!

06:01.763 --> 06:05.698
I have been pushed around
too much on this island.

06:05.734 --> 06:08.234
I'm sick of living in fear.

06:08.269 --> 06:10.970
We have to do what's right, Steve.

06:11.006 --> 06:13.506
We are signaling that sh...

06:15.810 --> 06:17.844
Now, where was I?

06:17.879 --> 06:19.879
Oh, that's right.

06:19.914 --> 06:21.814
We're not leaving the island!

06:21.850 --> 06:23.616
Oh, my God. Did he just kill Turdhole?!

06:23.652 --> 06:25.251
All right. We got to signal the ship.

06:25.286 --> 06:26.519
We got to start a fire.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.521
No, no, no, no! He's lost his damn mind!

06:28.556 --> 06:30.356
If he sees the smoke, he
might kill someone else!

06:30.391 --> 06:33.926
Owen, what do we do?

06:35.897 --> 06:38.865
Pack, go and destroy the flare gun.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.768
Karen and I will wait here

06:41.803 --> 06:44.470
and make sure no one
does anything stupid.

06:49.018 --> 06:50.242
Pack!

06:50.278 --> 06:51.978
- The flare gun!
- Yeah.

06:52.013 --> 06:54.446
Shit!

06:54.482 --> 06:55.748
Stop looking at me!

06:58.386 --> 07:00.519
Okay, I'm gonna go after
Pack and get that flare gun.

07:00.555 --> 07:02.321
- You guys help the others.
- All right.

07:02.356 --> 07:03.656
Okay.

07:03.692 --> 07:05.357
It's time to drop the
hammer on these idiots.

07:05.393 --> 07:06.559
Let's do th...

07:06.594 --> 07:08.828
Oh, my God!

07:08.863 --> 07:10.029
Are you okay?

07:10.065 --> 07:12.398
Yeah. I'm... I'm fine.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.733
You're bleeding!

07:13.768 --> 07:15.768
- Ah, it's nothing.
- Look at your love handles.

07:15.804 --> 07:17.603
It's getting crazy infected.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.405
- You mean my ab?
- Oh, my God.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.940
- No, it's good. It's good.
- Oh, my God.

07:20.975 --> 07:22.374
All right. I got to go save Jess.

07:22.410 --> 07:24.610
No. Todd, stop, okay?

07:24.645 --> 07:26.679
You're gonna get yourself killed.

07:26.715 --> 07:30.349
You got to save Jess, all right?

07:30.384 --> 07:31.684
Promise me.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.919
I promise.

07:32.954 --> 07:36.989
No one deserves to be thrown in a pit.

07:37.605 --> 07:40.639
Damn! Goose bumpers!

07:40.674 --> 07:42.241
- Right?
- Yeah, that sounded hardcore.

07:42.276 --> 07:44.143
Okay. I'm gonna go.

07:44.522 --> 07:46.689
Roger? Roger?

07:46.725 --> 07:48.224
You got to let us out of here, man.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.560
You're not going anywhere
unless Steve says.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.596
Roger, the boat is right
out there, okay?!

07:53.631 --> 07:54.997
Don't you want to go home on that boat?!

07:55.032 --> 07:56.632
Look at me. Look at my face!

07:56.668 --> 07:59.569
I can't go back to the real
world looking like this.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.571
Come on, man. Your face
...Your face is fine.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.305
It doesn't look like... like sausage.

08:03.341 --> 08:04.707
Don't push me.

08:04.743 --> 08:07.076
I killed a man outside Tallahassee.
I'll do it again.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.513
Oh, God! Oh, what the shit?

08:13.985 --> 08:15.485
Okay.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.253
We got to get you guys the
hell out of here. Come on!

08:19.409 --> 08:20.423
Hey, Pack.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.624
- Get back!
- Hey.

08:21.659 --> 08:23.058
What are you doing here?

08:23.094 --> 08:25.528
Hey, man, the boat is leaving, okay?

08:25.563 --> 08:27.162
Come on. Come on, don't
you want to go home?

08:27.198 --> 08:31.066
Buddy, you can't go back there.

08:31.102 --> 08:33.403
You'll be known as the
guy who ate a dude!

08:33.438 --> 08:36.138
Pack! Pack! Hey. Give me the gun.

08:36.173 --> 08:39.409
I can't. I can't go back!

08:39.443 --> 08:41.110
Oh, my God!

08:41.145 --> 08:43.645
Oh, God! I just got a
whiff of you. Dang.

08:43.681 --> 08:46.148
Okay, now we just need to figure out

08:46.183 --> 08:48.484
how to get the gun back
from that crazy motherfu...

08:53.640 --> 08:55.257
Welcome home, Florence.

08:58.182 --> 08:59.429
You can't shoot all of us!

08:59.464 --> 09:00.630
Everybody, run!

09:00.665 --> 09:02.732
Wait! We're running or not?

09:02.767 --> 09:04.133
Okay!

09:08.339 --> 09:09.505
Well, come on, Karen!

09:09.541 --> 09:11.273
Don't just stand there! Get them!

09:11.309 --> 09:14.076
Shit, shit, shit!

09:15.713 --> 09:18.414
Don't you want to get rescued, huh?

09:18.450 --> 09:22.017
Owen, I've done things
...unspeakable things.

09:22.053 --> 09:23.352
I'm a monster!

09:23.387 --> 09:25.287
Yeah, you are!

09:25.323 --> 09:27.089
Hey, buddy, listen to me.

09:27.124 --> 09:29.459
Whatever you did, it can't be that bad.

09:29.494 --> 09:30.660
I ate a dude!

09:30.695 --> 09:32.562
Holy sh... wow!

09:32.597 --> 09:34.564
Okay, that's a lot to process.

09:34.599 --> 09:37.232
I got to think about that for a second.

09:38.470 --> 09:39.669
How'd you kill him?

09:39.704 --> 09:41.070
I didn't kill him.

09:41.105 --> 09:42.271
He was already dead.

09:42.306 --> 09:43.473
I was starving.

09:43.508 --> 09:45.541
Okay, well, that's, you know...

09:46.179 --> 09:47.644
It's whatever.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.946
"Whatever"?

09:48.981 --> 09:51.715
Pack, it's gross that you ate someone,

09:51.750 --> 09:54.017
but... you're not a monster.

09:54.053 --> 09:55.719
Really?

09:57.190 --> 09:59.290
It's totally normal.

09:59.325 --> 10:03.160
So, people won't think I'm
insane like... like Steve said?

10:03.196 --> 10:04.695
I don't think so.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.430
In fact, I think that people like

10:06.466 --> 10:09.333
when other people do crazy
shit to survive, you know?

10:09.368 --> 10:12.035
I think they'll probably
make a movie about you.

10:12.071 --> 10:13.337
Right?

10:13.372 --> 10:15.206
Like, "127 Hours"...

10:15.241 --> 10:16.873
"Alive," you know?

10:16.909 --> 10:18.175
"The Revenant."

10:18.211 --> 10:19.977
Who would play me?

10:20.012 --> 10:21.878
Really?

10:21.914 --> 10:23.847
Don Cheadle.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.083
I love Don Don Cheadle.

10:26.119 --> 10:27.818
- Yeah.
- He's got so much range.

10:27.853 --> 10:29.019
I know. Give me the gun.

10:29.697 --> 10:30.755
No.

10:33.913 --> 10:35.879
Get out of here.

10:35.915 --> 10:37.181
What are you doing?!

10:37.216 --> 10:39.016
Pack, you can't go home!

10:39.051 --> 10:40.518
And Don Cheadle?

10:40.553 --> 10:43.487
You think the Chead is gonna
waste his talent on you?!

10:43.523 --> 10:45.155
Goodbye, Jerry.

10:45.191 --> 10:46.824
No! No! No!

10:48.160 --> 10:49.893
No! No!

10:49.929 --> 10:52.062
What are you doing, Pack?!

10:52.097 --> 10:54.498
No!

10:54.534 --> 10:58.068
But I would watch you burn
for 100 years if I could.

10:59.972 --> 11:03.140
I hate you, Jerry!

11:03.175 --> 11:07.478
Okay, well, thanks so
much for the... yeah.

11:07.513 --> 11:08.946
No!

11:08.981 --> 11:10.348
I'm gonna get rescued,
and I'm gonna go back!

11:10.383 --> 11:12.516
No! And they're gonna
write a book about me,

11:12.552 --> 11:14.151
and it's gonna be a bestseller.

11:14.186 --> 11:16.454
Someone's gonna ghostwrite
the shit out of that book!

11:16.489 --> 11:18.222
No!

11:18.257 --> 11:20.057
And Don Cheadle's gonna do the
movie 'cause the money's right,

11:20.092 --> 11:21.425
and he's gonna win an Oscar.

11:21.461 --> 11:23.494
If you think Don Cheadle's
gonna play you,

11:23.529 --> 11:25.363
you are living in the house of lies!

11:25.398 --> 11:26.397
You're done!

11:26.432 --> 11:27.598
No!

11:27.633 --> 11:29.667
You're not even a fun ghost!

11:29.702 --> 11:31.568
You suck, you ghost piece of shit.

11:32.405 --> 11:34.304
Why fire?! Why fire?!

11:34.340 --> 11:37.274
Why couldn't you just let me fade away

11:37.309 --> 11:39.109
like "Field of Dreams"?

11:40.513 --> 11:42.413
You sick fucker.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.074

11:54.005 --> 11:55.239
I think we lost them.

11:56.178 --> 11:58.394
Chet!

11:59.732 --> 12:01.632
That's Karen!

12:01.667 --> 12:04.134
Jess!

12:13.145 --> 12:15.413
Maybe she's gone.

12:19.419 --> 12:21.452
Oh, God! No!

12:25.415 --> 12:29.178
- The ship's getting farther away!
- Shut up! No one move!

12:29.179 --> 12:32.280
Hey, Steve.

12:32.315 --> 12:34.683
- Owen.
- Owen, you came back!

12:34.718 --> 12:36.484
You bet I did, buddy.

12:36.519 --> 12:38.553
The ship's leaving.
You're too late, Owen.

12:38.589 --> 12:40.755
- Am I?
- He's got the flare gun!

12:40.791 --> 12:43.191
It's over, Steve.

12:43.226 --> 12:45.259
Once I fire this, we're saved.

12:45.295 --> 12:48.296
- Oh, God!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

12:48.331 --> 12:49.731
You shoot the flare gun,

12:49.766 --> 12:51.700
and I'll blow his giant head off.

12:51.735 --> 12:54.368
Hey, hey! Let's... Let's relax, Steve.

12:54.404 --> 12:55.737
You relax, Steve!

12:55.772 --> 12:57.472
I'm already relaxed!

12:57.507 --> 12:58.907
I'm very relaxed!

12:58.942 --> 13:01.242
I'm on a holiday, goddamn it!

13:01.277 --> 13:02.711
Well, well, well.

13:02.746 --> 13:05.346
Looky what we have here...

13:05.381 --> 13:08.182
the Powerpuff Girl and
her crunchy boy-toy.

13:08.218 --> 13:10.485
It's time to drag you back to camp.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.787
Karen, please don't kill me!

13:12.823 --> 13:14.555
Please, I'm sorry!

13:14.591 --> 13:15.757
Don't kill me!

13:16.994 --> 13:18.927
Do you want me to kill her for you?

13:18.962 --> 13:20.528
I'll kill her right now!

13:20.563 --> 13:23.197
- Jesus, Chet!
- Please!

13:23.233 --> 13:24.899
Karen, why are you doing this?

13:24.935 --> 13:27.902
Why? Respect.

13:27.938 --> 13:30.204
My whole life, people
have laughed at me,

13:30.240 --> 13:31.973
but here... here...

13:32.009 --> 13:36.544
I'm finally a Vice President... A VP!

13:36.579 --> 13:38.446
Hey, dragon bitch!

13:39.933 --> 13:40.815
You want to dance?

13:40.851 --> 13:42.250
Todd.

13:42.285 --> 13:43.985
Todd! You're alive!

13:44.021 --> 13:46.220
You came back for me!

13:46.256 --> 13:49.557
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

13:49.592 --> 13:51.359
I was a dick.

13:51.394 --> 13:52.961
Really?

13:52.996 --> 13:54.462
Yeah.

13:54.497 --> 13:59.233
Also... this boar-snatching bee-otch

13:59.269 --> 14:02.403
is about to get a big,
old, fat knuckle sandwich,

14:02.438 --> 14:03.805
courtesy of "Streaks."

14:06.001 --> 14:07.742
Finally!

14:07.778 --> 14:10.578
I was beginning to think
this was a dickless island.

14:10.613 --> 14:11.980
Oh, no, honey.

14:12.015 --> 14:15.516
This island's got some
wee-wee, all right.

14:15.552 --> 14:16.785
Yeah!

14:16.820 --> 14:20.688
- Todd, your stomach!
- Six-pack. I'm fine.

14:21.364 --> 14:23.270
You look like shit.

14:23.271 --> 14:26.627
So why don't we make
this interesting, huh?

14:30.767 --> 14:32.466
- Wow.
- Holy moly.

14:32.502 --> 14:35.737
A fair fight, mano a mano.

14:35.772 --> 14:37.638
You're not gonna distract me

14:37.674 --> 14:39.941
with your surprisingly supple breasts.

14:39.976 --> 14:41.642
Why don't you take a photo?

14:41.678 --> 14:42.944
It'll last longer!

14:46.850 --> 14:48.750
Put a shirt on, weirdo!

14:51.554 --> 14:53.354
See, that's the problem.

14:53.389 --> 14:55.890
Why is it weird 'cause I'm topless, huh?

14:57.594 --> 15:01.629
The glass ceiling is made out
of bra straps and nylon!

15:01.664 --> 15:03.364
No! It's not!

15:03.399 --> 15:05.700
It's made out of glass.

15:07.037 --> 15:07.936
Yeah, babe!

15:09.039 --> 15:10.739
That one was for meat!

15:11.975 --> 15:14.342
I felt a little twinge in the girls.

15:14.377 --> 15:15.810
Oh, my God.

15:15.846 --> 15:17.011
Oh, my God!

15:17.047 --> 15:18.713
I think that's a lump!

15:18.749 --> 15:20.514
Is that a lump?

15:20.550 --> 15:21.916
Oh, my God.

15:21.952 --> 15:24.019
Oh, Jesus, I'm so sorry.
I mean, there's a lot...

15:24.020 --> 15:25.053
Oh, my God.

15:26.220 --> 15:28.623
- That's my dick!
- Oh, no! Not the dick!

15:30.360 --> 15:34.662
That's what's called using your
feminine wiles, you pussy!

15:41.104 --> 15:42.771
Son of a bitch!

15:42.806 --> 15:44.705
I'm gonna gut you like your pig!

15:45.542 --> 15:48.109
Get your finger out of my wound!

15:49.913 --> 15:52.046
My titties!

15:52.082 --> 15:54.749
- Put it back in!
- Chet, we have to do something!

15:54.785 --> 15:56.951
We can't! I'm a pacifist!

15:58.454 --> 15:59.620
No way.

16:02.159 --> 16:04.392
The pit can't save you now, Todd.

16:04.427 --> 16:05.927
It's just you, me, and the jungle!

16:07.164 --> 16:09.563
Hey, Karen!

16:11.835 --> 16:13.701
No frickin' way.

16:13.736 --> 16:16.070
My driver!

16:16.106 --> 16:17.738
I knew it was out here!

16:17.774 --> 16:19.040
Todd!

16:19.075 --> 16:21.042
You came back for me.

16:21.077 --> 16:22.743
I thought you died.

16:22.779 --> 16:23.978
They can't kill me.

16:25.448 --> 16:27.548
I love you, you little Asian plum.

16:27.583 --> 16:28.916
I love you.

16:30.854 --> 16:32.687
Put down the flare gun, Owen.

16:32.722 --> 16:34.588
Come on. Do it for your lover.

16:34.624 --> 16:36.157
Owen, it's okay.

16:36.193 --> 16:37.658
Fire it, man.

16:37.694 --> 16:39.727
If he kills me, so be it.

16:39.762 --> 16:41.029
I'll do it!

16:46.837 --> 16:48.821
I've already killed Turdhole today.

16:48.822 --> 16:50.187
Don't make me kill again.

16:50.223 --> 16:51.389
Owen, just shoot it.

16:51.425 --> 16:52.657
No, Danny, I can't just...

16:52.692 --> 16:55.259
Owen, it's okay. Get off the island.

16:55.295 --> 16:57.228
Don't let him hold us hostage.

17:00.434 --> 17:03.200
"Always shoot your hostage?"
Always shoot the hostage.

17:03.236 --> 17:04.836
That is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

17:04.871 --> 17:06.237
What if you kill the hostage?

17:06.271 --> 17:09.641
Sometimes, you got to role the dice.

17:29.459 --> 17:31.062
Freeze! You're under arrest!

17:34.067 --> 17:36.434
Yeah!

17:37.069 --> 17:38.937
- Oh, dude, you shot me!
- Yeah.

17:38.972 --> 17:41.405
Oh, you shot... You shot the hostage!

17:41.441 --> 17:42.807
Yeah, like you said.

17:43.609 --> 17:45.041
How'd you know it was gonna work?

17:45.076 --> 17:46.509
I just rolled the dice.

17:46.545 --> 17:48.578
'Cause that's what I said
to you in the jungle!

17:48.614 --> 17:51.414
- It was a callback!
- It was a great callback!

17:51.450 --> 17:53.815
Oh, thanks, man!

17:53.816 --> 17:55.683
Listen, man, I just want you to know

17:55.718 --> 17:57.918
I was wrong about everything.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.452
Okay? You were right.

17:59.488 --> 18:00.654
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18:00.690 --> 18:02.222
I didn't know how to let you in.

18:02.257 --> 18:04.524
Well, you're here now.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.893
I love you, bro.

18:05.928 --> 18:08.195
- I love you, bro.
- Yeah.

18:08.230 --> 18:09.494
All right, help me get up.

18:09.518 --> 18:10.695
Yeah.

18:12.267 --> 18:14.968
God! Oh, that still burns!

18:15.004 --> 18:17.237
Well, you got shot in the leg with
a flare gun. That's gonna hurt.

18:36.826 --> 18:40.094
Guys, I'm sorry!

18:40.129 --> 18:43.931
I stuffed up, okay?

18:52.749 --> 18:53.837
Come on!

18:54.037 --> 18:56.056
Yeah!

19:05.955 --> 19:08.288
Hello!

19:08.323 --> 19:11.725
Hey, we're just a couple of
simple South Asian fishermen.

19:11.761 --> 19:14.762
Are you guys the survivors of
Lotus Airlines Flight 816?

19:14.797 --> 19:16.953
You bet your ass we are!

19:16.981 --> 19:18.390
- Yes!
- Yeah.

19:19.068 --> 19:20.533
Oh, wow!

19:20.569 --> 19:21.935
That is great, great news!

19:21.971 --> 19:23.703
We've been looking for
you guys for a few days.

19:23.739 --> 19:25.839
- You have?
- Yes, yes! Well, see...

19:25.875 --> 19:27.368
Well, the truth is we're
not actually fishermen...

19:27.402 --> 19:29.038
We're pirates, motherfuckers!

19:31.523 --> 19:33.148
- Motherfucker, motherfucker.
- Hey...

19:33.149 --> 19:34.782
What... What are you doing right now?

19:34.817 --> 19:36.616
- What?
- Are you serious right now?

19:36.652 --> 19:38.252
What... What did we talk about?
How many times do we

19:38.287 --> 19:39.953
- have to talk about this rule?
When you do that... - Come on!

19:39.989 --> 19:41.554
No, when you go dick
swinging, you invite panic!

19:41.590 --> 19:43.590
- Come... - Okay... no! You
get people all riled up,

19:43.625 --> 19:45.793
and then that's when we make mistakes!

19:45.828 --> 19:47.261
Look, man, I didn't get into the
pirate game to be pussyfooting around!

19:47.296 --> 19:48.929
What are you talking...
what pu-pussyfooting?

19:48.964 --> 19:50.130
Hey!

19:50.166 --> 19:51.765
What is happening right now?

19:51.801 --> 19:53.833
We... Well... Was it not obvious?

19:53.834 --> 19:55.865
We're here to... Oh, we're
here to kidnap you guys.

19:56.305 --> 19:57.971
Well, at least... Well, just one of you.

19:58.007 --> 19:59.639
Which one of you guys is Danny Wallace?

19:59.675 --> 20:02.075
- Danny, Danny Wallace?
- There he is.

20:02.111 --> 20:03.811
I see you, dawg!

20:05.214 --> 20:07.181
Look at that, richest boy in the world

20:07.216 --> 20:09.082
slumming it on some deserted island.

20:09.118 --> 20:10.650
What?

20:11.848 --> 20:12.686
Oh, shit.

20:12.721 --> 20:14.154
You don't know who this is?

20:14.190 --> 20:16.356
His family's worth billions!

20:16.391 --> 20:18.358
Oh, yeah. Hey, when
your plane went down,

20:18.393 --> 20:20.928
this guy's face was on every
TV screen in the world!

20:20.963 --> 20:23.630
And we gonna hold you
for a fatass ransom!

20:26.001 --> 20:29.002
I am so jazzed! I'm Miles
Davis-ing this motherfucker.

20:29.038 --> 20:30.518
