thinking about you.

haven't made an effort

this is, a priority.

But?

02:39.243 --> 02:42.495
But you were too busy helping the
President spark a mutiny on my ship.

02:42.579 --> 02:45.414
Or, but you wanted to wait
until you were desperate

02:45.499 --> 02:48.918
and needed a shoulder to cry
on before making your move?

02:50.796 --> 02:53.214
I think that was
a little uncalled for.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.803
Yeah, I'm sorry. You're right.

split into two forces.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.157
One moving forward...

12:22.242 --> 12:23.992
Forward, one moving aft.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.786
Yes, sir.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.706
I've seen this before.
These are their objectives.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.711
Secondary Damage Control and
Auxiliary Fire Control, sir.

12:34.796 --> 12:38.215
If they're successful, they will
override our decompression safeties

12:38.299 --> 12:39.800
and vent us
all into space.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.761
Once we're all dead,
they'll turn the ship's guns

12:42.846 --> 12:45.764
on the fleet and wipe
it out once and for all.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.661
What do you have there?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.749
It's a child, obviously.

13:57.879 --> 13:58.921
A child?

14:00.548 --> 14:02.257
Can I hold it?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.178
Please.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.612
Is this the shape
of things to come?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.616
That's my understanding.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.792
Only one thing for it,
then.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.354
Our baby?

15:40.356 --> 15:43.942
Adama, I saw him drown the baby.

15:47.155 --> 15:50.324
Why would anyone
want to drown a baby?

15:50.408 --> 15:52.034
Gaius, the answer is all around us.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.756
What happened here?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.007
Human sacrifice.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.886
Not the fairytales your
scriptures would have you believe.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.890
I thought Kobol was supposed
to be a paradise, or something.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.060
Some place where

16:18.686 --> 16:21.563
gods lived with the
humans in harmony, or...

16:21.648 --> 16:25.734
For a time, perhaps. Then your
true nature asserted itself.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.571
Your brutality. Your
depravity. Your barbarism.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.241
So the scriptures
are all a lie.

16:35.036 --> 16:39.373
It's all just a lie, just a
cover-up for all this savagery.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.291
Exactly.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.795
All of this has happened before, Gaius,

16:44.879 --> 16:46.588
and all of it
will happen again.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.091
Adama.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.969
Mankind's true nature
will always assert itself.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.933
So he will try
and kill our baby.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.396
Only if you let him, Gaius.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.565
Only if you let him.

wasn't here in this fight.

and cleaned the locker out before us.

a knuckle dragger here.

fight Centurions.

31:51.660 --> 31:52.660
Five armed effectives.

31:52.744 --> 31:53.744
We haven't seen
anything but bodies

31:53.829 --> 31:55.663
between here
and the hangar deck.

32:04.840 --> 32:05.840
BONNINGTON: Clear.

32:06.675 --> 32:07.883
Okay, from what I can remember,

32:07.968 --> 32:10.636
the sickbay is about 20
meters through that hatch.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.727
How you feeling?

32:17.853 --> 32:19.353
Like I'm walking underwater.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.442
Any Marines with you?

32:24.526 --> 32:26.527
Privates Collishaw, Twinam.

32:26.612 --> 32:30.281
Take your men and proceed without
delay to Aft Damage Control.

32:30.866 --> 32:31.949
Is that yours?

32:33.869 --> 32:36.120
Yeah, I guess it is now.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.291
Okay. If you're gonna keep
it in your trousers like that,

32:41.209 --> 32:43.127
you might want to
turn the safety on.

32:44.838 --> 32:45.963
Great.

32:48.634 --> 32:49.884
VENNER: Is it stuck?

32:50.510 --> 32:53.512
No, frak!
The hatch won't open.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.556
The other side's
been depressurized.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.017
All right, Corporal
Venner, this is your ship.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.727
I'm just a tourist.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.479
Find us another
way to sickbay.

33:01.563 --> 33:02.647
Okay.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.610
Okay, we have to head
toward Aft Damage Control.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.070
Aft Damage Control.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.279
APOLLO: Aft Damage Control?

33:10.405 --> 33:11.489
That's what they're after.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.199
Let's not waste
any more time.

33:13.283 --> 33:14.867
You get to Aft
Damage Control.

33:14.951 --> 33:16.827
And get there right
frakking now, mister.

33:16.912 --> 33:20.456
Get there before the Cylons or
we lose the ship. Is that clear?

33:20.791 --> 33:23.709
Aft Damage Control. RFN.
On our way. Apollo out.

33:38.392 --> 33:39.600
Okay. Hold on.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.107
Okay, we made it.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.401
Twinam, Jammer,
you take this side.

33:48.485 --> 33:49.527
Yes, sir.

33:49.611 --> 33:50.861
APOLLO: Kat, Collishaw,
you take that side.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.154
We're gonna
need some cover.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.531
All right, let's move.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.533
Let's get this stuff out.

33:55.617 --> 33:56.701
Yes, sir.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.507
Wait.

34:12.426 --> 34:13.384
(MAN SCREAMING)

(BULLETS FIRING)

34:16.138 --> 34:17.096
That's not so...

34:17.180 --> 34:18.848
Okay, everybody, get down.
Stay down.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.644
Hold your fire
till I give the signal.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.062
Remember,
you only have one round,

34:25.147 --> 34:27.189
so it's gotta be a
headshot to make a kill.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.691
You understand? Understood?

34:28.775 --> 34:29.775
Yes, sir.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.153
Kat, kill the flashlight.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.658
Take cover. Take cover.

34:37.743 --> 34:38.993
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.756
APOLLO: Steady up there,
Jammer.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.674
Yes, sir.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.135
Not really cut
out for this, sir.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.179
Me, neither.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.808
But sometimes you
gotta roll the hard six.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.519
What does that mean, sir?

35:07.981 --> 35:10.357
I don't know.
It's something my dad says.

35:10.442 --> 35:14.528
Just don't shoot till
I tell you to, all right?

35:17.365 --> 35:20.201
Okay, we're in good
shape. They're coming.

35:21.411 --> 35:22.953
But we're in good shape.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.211
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

35:46.353 --> 35:49.688
Headshot. Reload. Headshot.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.735
Headshot. Reload. Headshot.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.404
Reload. Headshot.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.627
Okay, they're coming. Everybody down!

36:12.671 --> 36:15.422
You want to shoot that, you
have to take the safety off.

Are you all right?

37:14.024 --> 37:16.400
Yes, I'm fine.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.489
We did it. We got them all!

37:24.326 --> 37:26.452
They don't look so
big now, do they?

37:29.831 --> 37:31.332
They look big enough.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.002
KAT: Oh, gods.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.840

37:40.508 --> 37:41.592
Yeah.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.677
VENNER: Have you been shot?

37:44.512 --> 37:45.888
No, I don't think so.

37:46.473 --> 37:47.556
Yeah?

37:47.682 --> 37:48.807
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.602
Oh!

The gods must be
watching over you.

Hey.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.309
How you feel?

39:14.644 --> 39:15.811
Better.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.822
I thought you said...

39:26.948 --> 39:28.407
Forget what I said

39:28.742 --> 39:31.201
and listen to
what I'm saying.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.453
Are you listening?

39:32.787 --> 39:33.996
Uh-huh.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.263
I'm sorry.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.140
(CHUCKLES)

39:53.433 --> 39:55.350
I didn't hear that.
Could you...

39:55.560 --> 39:56.727
Could you do that
one more time?

39:56.811 --> 39:58.979
Come here. Let me be clear.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.485
Get the curtain.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.160
TIGH: Doc Cottle's on his way.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.746
He'll be here any minute.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.466
He's gonna be all right.
You know that.

40:31.346 --> 40:34.139
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

40:38.728 --> 40:41.939
Colonel, I assume there's still
a cell out there waiting for me?

40:42.023 --> 40:43.065
That's right.

40:46.361 --> 40:47.903
Corporal Venner, I'm ready.

40:57.205 --> 41:00.374
I can't believe you sided with
that woman against the old man.

41:00.667 --> 41:04.086
I wouldn't do that if you put
a gun to my head, and you did.

41:05.547 --> 41:08.757
As far as I'm concerned, you're
not fit to wear a uniform.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.763
You're right
about that part.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.558
I am not fit to
wear the uniform.

41:20.228 --> 41:21.728
And maybe I never was.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.816
Then again,
neither were you.

41:31.197 --> 41:35.617
But this isn't my ship, and it
sure as hell isn't yours. It's his.

41:37.287 --> 41:42.249
And when he wakes up, he'll decide
what to do with the both of us.

42:16.618 --> 42:18.660
Thank the gods
I didn't have kids.
