00:48.600 --> 00:51.672
<i>"And the Lord made an east wind
blow across the land,"</i>

00:51.840 --> 00:54.116
<i>all that day and all night.</i>

00:54.280 --> 00:56.556
And the wind had brought the locusts.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.632
They invaded all Egypt,

00:58.800 --> 01:02.430
settled down in every part of the country
in great numbers.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.989
<i>They covered all the
ground until it was black.</i>

01:05.160 --> 01:08.597
<i>They devoured all that
was left after the hail,</i>

01:08.760 --> 01:11.958
<i>everything growing in the fields,
the fruit on the trees.</i>

01:12.120 --> 01:15.557
<i>Nothing green was left
in any part of the land of Egypt.</i>

01:16.760 --> 01:20.117
The Egyptians had broken their promise
to the Israelites

01:20.280 --> 01:22.158
and God punished them with a plague

01:22.320 --> 01:24.277
that made the sky dark

01:24.440 --> 01:26.318
and the land barren.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.831
What a gloomy sermon.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.674
I found it rather thought-provoking.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.595
How pestilence and plague
is part of God's will.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.752
What can be gloomier than that?

01:57.600 --> 02:01.150
<i>I've seen potato fields in my parish
where every plant is black, my lord,</i>

02:01.320 --> 02:03.312
and when they dig the
tubers up, they're putrid.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.554
I believe the black stuff can be... scraped
off, and what is left may be boiled down

02:07.720 --> 02:10.030
to make a farinaceous mixture
which is nourishing.

02:10.199 --> 02:13.318
I have set up a soup kitchen in my parish,
for my flock.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.437
And in the spirit of Christian charity,

02:15.600 --> 02:19.674
I welcome any papist who wishes to be
baptised into the Church of Ireland.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.674
My congregation,
I must say, has swelled.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.594
Every cloud - or should
I say, rotten potato -

02:25.760 --> 02:27.319
has a silver lining.

02:27.480 --> 02:31.599
But if some poor beggar were to show up
without a certificate of baptism, what then?

02:31.760 --> 02:35.071
I seem to remember, Traill,
that you were not so charitably disposed

02:35.240 --> 02:38.517
towards the papists in your parish
when they refused to pay their tithes.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.115
That was wilful disobedience, my lord,

02:41.280 --> 02:43.590
but this... calamity is
not of their making.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.356
Oh, come now, Traill. I think you will find
it is entirely of their own making.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.194
- This reliance on one...
- Let us be clear about this.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.675
Miss Stevens, a package.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.712
And this for Mr Edwards.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.995
And what is this?

03:05.160 --> 03:07.197
I just don't recognise these markings.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.795
- That will be for me.
- Are you sure, Miss Cleary?

03:09.960 --> 03:12.600
- They look like hieroglyphics.
- Just give her the letter.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.514
And I thought they spoke
English in Ireland.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.399
Very well, carry on.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.072
Ernest!

03:35.120 --> 03:36.600
Can it really be you?

03:36.760 --> 03:38.831
I wasn't expecting you
until the christening.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.593
Well, I hope I am still welcome.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.752
You are always welcome here.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.116
How are things at Coburg?

03:45.280 --> 03:46.873
You know how it is.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.919
The roof of the Hall of
Giants is still leaking.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.994
And the girls at the Golden Fleece
are as educational as ever.

03:57.720 --> 04:02.112
I heard that after Paris
you went straight to Baden-Baden.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.158
It seems you are never at home.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.800
Uh...

04:05.960 --> 04:10.000
My doctors advised me that a course
of the waters there might be beneficial.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.640
What, you are ill?

04:12.560 --> 04:14.279
Nothing serious.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.433
I enjoyed myself
perhaps a little too much in Paris.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.314
Well, I am glad you have come back.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.432
News from home?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.035
It's nothing.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.840
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.557
Your Majesty, Mr Trevelyan here,
who works in the Irish office,

05:02.720 --> 05:06.350
has drawn up some suggestions
for the new Archbishop of Dublin.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.880
I don't know any of these names.

05:12.040 --> 05:16.159
It is hard to attract candidates of the very
highest calibre to the Irish see, Ma'am.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.994
The church there has
financial difficulties.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.516
The so-called tithe war
has been very damaging.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.080
A war?

05:24.280 --> 05:27.591
The Irish, as a race,
are prone to exaggeration, Ma'am.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.355
Some unruly elements
among the Catholic peasantry

05:30.520 --> 05:32.796
objected to paying tithes
to the Church of Ireland

05:32.960 --> 05:34.474
and made some violent protests.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.553
I believe some clergymen
were burnt in effigy and suchlike.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.552
But if the peasants are Catholic, then...

05:39.720 --> 05:42.872
why are they paying money
to a church they don't belong to?

05:43.040 --> 05:46.272
The Church of Ireland
is the established church.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.035
It is a vital bulwark against
the forces of anarchy, Ma'am.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.079
Catholics outnumber
Protestants by ten to one.

05:52.240 --> 05:56.837
If the Church were to flounder, the very
foundation of Irish society would crumble.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.396
I had no idea.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.519
I would be happy to explain
the Irish situation further, Ma'am.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.400
When your nursery duties allow, of course.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.712
- Your Honour!
- Halt!

06:17.880 --> 06:19.439
Stop!

07:09.760 --> 07:11.752
Mummy won't wake up.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.273
Daddy!

07:47.440 --> 07:49.796
Hello. Hello, my darling.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.120
If you look carefully, sir,

08:09.280 --> 08:12.352
you can still see the remains
of the Roman hypocaust.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.193
The palace is built on a sewer?

08:14.360 --> 08:17.319
Well, as I made clear in my report,

08:17.480 --> 08:21.110
in London we're still relying on a drainage
system that was built by the Romans.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.636
Half a mile from here,
in the rookeries of Pimlico,

08:23.800 --> 08:27.350
thousands of people are living
without any access to clean water

08:27.520 --> 08:29.591
and no way to dispose of their waste.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.355
The streets are no better than open sewers.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.671
So what you are saying is that...

08:35.520 --> 08:37.318
Even in the 19th century,

08:37.480 --> 08:40.313
our public sanitation
is inferior to that of the Romans?

08:40.480 --> 08:42.198
I'm afraid so.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.993
Well, I will not only be supporting
your commission, Mr Chadwick,

08:46.160 --> 08:48.880
I fear your work must
begin here at the palace.

08:49.840 --> 08:53.311
We must show the world
that cleanliness is next to godliness.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.031
Thank you. Gentlemen, please...

08:59.840 --> 09:04.357
And if you really intend
to put water closets throughout the palace,

09:04.520 --> 09:06.318
well, here would be a suitable place

09:06.480 --> 09:08.278
to install one for the servants.

09:08.440 --> 09:12.116
Hygiene should not only be
the preserve of the rich, Mr Chadwick.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.636
I couldn't agree with you more,
your Royal Highness.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.272
Hygiene? Is that German
for "an assault on individual liberty"?

09:19.440 --> 09:21.750
I think that the female
members of the household

09:21.920 --> 09:24.799
will see it not as an assault,
but as a convenience.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.151
I'm going to bed, Robert.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.912
Please don't stay up all night.

09:52.040 --> 09:56.478
I saw a woman die of starvation
today, Anne. She left five children.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.360
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll visit the family tomorrow.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.159
The name is Keenan.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.153
They live at the crossroads.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.193
- Catholics?
- Famine has no denomination, Anne.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.192
The people of this parish
have nothing to eat.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.195
The same people that tried to burn this
house down three years ago, Robert?

10:16.800 --> 10:20.350
I know... but, Anne,
the entire potato harvest has gone.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.194
Did you speak to the Bishop
about a living in Dublin?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.352
We had more important matters to discuss.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.911
What could be more important
than your family's happiness, Robert?

10:57.640 --> 11:01.680
<i>Sir, the haggard eye.
The pale, sunken cheek.</i>

11:02.360 --> 11:05.637
<i>One poor creature came up to me
and staggered like a drunk man.</i>

11:05.800 --> 11:09.396
<i>I charged him with intoxication
but, alas, it was starvation.</i>

11:10.280 --> 11:13.876
<i>Famine is advancing with strides so fearful
that I verily believe</i>

11:14.040 --> 11:17.033
<i>that if some superhuman effort
is not made to relieve us,</i>

11:17.200 --> 11:20.955
<i>half our population will erelong
be blotted from the book of being.</i>

11:29.120 --> 11:33.273
Sir Robert, have you read this letter
from the Rector of Schull?

11:34.440 --> 11:38.639
He writes that people in his parish
are living off seaweed... and nettles.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.879
As you will see in my memorandum
of the 17th, Ma'am,

11:44.040 --> 11:46.714
nettles contain more nourishment
than you might imagine.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.191
I believe, when gathered young,
the leaves taste like spinach.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.876
Dr Traill writes that people
are too weak to bury their dead.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.515
And that corpses are left
by the side of the road.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.354
The Irish like to imbibe at funerals.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.070
Perhaps that is why they are incapable
of digging a decent grave.

12:08.280 --> 12:11.079
Aren't you going to do anything,
Prime Minister?

12:14.200 --> 12:17.750
I am afraid it would not be... desirable

12:17.920 --> 12:19.991
for the government to intervene, Ma'am.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.514
The truth is, Ma'am,

12:21.680 --> 12:25.310
the population of Ireland
has grown beyond its natural limits.

12:25.480 --> 12:30.680
It would be immoral of us to interfere in what
is an inevitable period of self-regulation.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.194
Self-regulation?

12:32.360 --> 12:35.114
I don't know if you are familiar
with the works of Malthus, Ma'am,

12:35.280 --> 12:37.033
but this is exactly as he predicted.

12:37.200 --> 12:41.399
Population growth always outstrips
food production, with inevitable results.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.871
I think I should like to visit Ireland.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.150
I feel I need to see the
situation for myself.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.835
Such a visit would be inadvisable, Ma'am.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.710
Why not? Surely my presence
will bring them some comfort.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.592
I'm not sure how comforting
your presence would be.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.631
I could not guarantee your safety.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.077
Yes, as I thought.

13:48.840 --> 13:52.959
The rash and the mouth lesions
are common manifestations, Mr Schubert.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.679
It's most unfortunate, of course,

13:54.840 --> 13:59.073
that the women who carry this disease
do not present their symptoms so evidently.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.516
- Is there a cure?
- I can not promise that,

14:01.680 --> 14:05.720
but there is a new treatment
that I believe is most efficacious.

14:05.880 --> 14:08.395
I am prepared to try anything.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.120
It is an expensive undertaking.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.317
Oh, don't worry, Doctor,
I can pay your fees.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.995
In that case, I will make the arrangements.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.877
<i>Six sessions of half an hour each and I
think you will see a distinct improvement.</i>

14:23.200 --> 14:25.032
<i>The mercury vapour is not pleasant,</i>

14:25.200 --> 14:27.954
<i>but I believe the results are worth it.</i>

14:34.720 --> 14:37.280
Only another ten minutes, Mr Schubert.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.750
And this is where the servants'
water closets would be.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.515
There can be no distinction
when it comes to hygiene.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.559
- Only when it comes to the Irish.
- I do not know what you mean.

14:52.720 --> 14:56.555
I mean, if English labourers were dying
in ditches, it would be a scandal.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.871
But because they're Irish, they're ignored.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.158
I... I do not see what that has to do
with water closets for servants.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.471
Albert, none of this makes sense to me.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.511
I merely wanted the people that work for us
to do so in decency.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.989
And would you rather
they worked in a sewer?

15:15.720 --> 15:19.509
Victoria, I can see how much
you care about the situation in Ireland,

15:19.680 --> 15:24.709
but... we have to remind ourselves
that charity begins at home.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.234
You think this is enough?

15:26.400 --> 15:30.997
Trust Sir Robert to do what is best.
He has served in Ireland.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.550
He knows the situation better than most.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.712
He's a good man... and a Christian.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.000
Your Majesty. Have you heard the news?

15:50.160 --> 15:51.719
What news?

15:53.560 --> 15:55.517
Sutherland's dead.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.992
How?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.231
It was a hunting accident.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.069
Poor Harriet.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.960
I shall ask her to the palace.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.437
Mm. Oh.

16:32.840 --> 16:35.309
You've given up already?

16:36.960 --> 16:39.429
Mens sana in corpore sano.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.432
I have neither.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.920
Well, you could always go back to Coburg.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.759
Live a healthy life there.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.550
With a delightful wife,
chosen for me by Uncle Leopold.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.472
Ernest erm...

16:59.760 --> 17:03.151
.. I do not know if you are aware...

17:04.400 --> 17:07.518
Harriet Sutherland's husband has died.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.397
I did not know that.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.994
He broke his neck whilst hunting.

17:19.280 --> 17:23.797
- Poor Harriet.
- Victoria would like her to return to court.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.953
I think perhaps it is too soon.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.600
What do you think?

17:38.640 --> 17:40.791
Drummond!

17:40.960 --> 17:43.316
I... I didn't know you were at the palace.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.871
I had some papers for the Queen
from the Prime Minister.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.951
I should go.
There is a debate on the Irish question.

17:52.120 --> 17:56.114
- Yes, the Queen talks about nothing else.
- The Prime Minister's doing what he can.

17:56.280 --> 18:00.035
He can't alter his policy just because
the Queen's read some letters in The Times.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.554
The Irish are starving.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.757
Then the Queen should
reach into her own purse.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.560
Oh, women are so damn emotional!

18:07.320 --> 18:09.073
Women like your fiancÃ©e?

18:10.280 --> 18:14.274
She's insisting on setting a date
right in the middle of the session.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.714
Sorry.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.560
You don't want to hear about that, do you?

18:22.160 --> 18:24.152
And I must go to the debate.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.834
Goodbye, Alfred.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.392
Have you lost your wits, Traill?

18:49.560 --> 18:51.916
Do you understand what you are saying?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.593
That we ought to feed
a gaggle of potato-eating papists

18:55.760 --> 18:58.355
because they have brought this
misfortune upon themselves

18:58.520 --> 19:00.796
through their own improvidence
and fecklessness?

19:00.960 --> 19:02.713
It's not their fault the harvest failed.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.873
It is not the Church's responsibility
to feed them. Let them find work.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.680
If we were to start supporting them,
there would be no end to it.

19:08.840 --> 19:13.153
- They must learn to live within their means!
- What means?

19:13.320 --> 19:16.870
A loaf of bread now costs ten shillings.
That is a year's rent, my lord.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.191
The people of this parish
are already starving.

19:19.360 --> 19:22.398
- Soon they will be homeless as well.
- That is not our concern, Traill!

19:22.560 --> 19:24.597
"For the poor shall never
cease out of the land."

19:24.760 --> 19:27.878
Therefore, I command thee say,
'Thou shalt open thine hand wide

19:28.040 --> 19:32.080
"unto thy brother, to thy poor
and to thy needy in thy land.'"

19:32.240 --> 19:34.152
Deuteronomy 15:11!

19:42.440 --> 19:45.319
Do you ever want to return
to civilisation, Traill?

19:47.320 --> 19:50.757
I hear the new Archbishop of Dublin
is looking for a chaplain.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.235
I'm sure your wife would like to return
to the society she's used to.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.276
Mrs Traill understands my mission.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.000
I hope so, Traill, because I can assure you

20:03.160 --> 20:06.676
you will never return to Dublin
if you persist in flouting my authority.

20:07.400 --> 20:12.395
I believe, my lord, that I answer to
a higher authority... even than yours.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.952
In County Cork, the potato crop
has failed completely,

20:20.120 --> 20:22.191
but if you send relief to Ireland...

20:22.360 --> 20:25.273
Then every factory worker in Manchester
will ask why he must spend

20:25.440 --> 20:28.877
half his income on bread,
while the Irish peasant is given charity.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.038
If I send help to Ireland, Drummond,

20:32.200 --> 20:36.877
it is only just that I repeal those laws that
artificially protect the price of British wheat.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.600
- If I do that...
- The party will rebel.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.912
Every Tory squire whose income
is guaranteed by those corn laws

20:43.080 --> 20:45.117
will think I've betrayed them.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.232
And they'd be right to do so.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.594
Wouldn't the Prime Minister
agree that it is time

20:52.760 --> 20:56.720
to call the formidable effects
of the potato blight a famine,

20:56.880 --> 20:58.712
and act accordingly?

21:02.200 --> 21:08.993
If it were known that we undertook the task
of supplying the Irish with food,

21:09.160 --> 21:14.872
we would, to a great extent,
lose the support of the Irish gentry...

21:15.040 --> 21:17.350
.. the Irish clergy...

21:17.520 --> 21:19.557
and the Irish farmer!

21:19.720 --> 21:22.394
Order! Order!

21:23.320 --> 21:26.040
Yes, hear, hear! Quite right, too!

21:27.760 --> 21:31.071
It is quite impossible

21:31.240 --> 21:36.395
for the government to support
four million people.

21:37.160 --> 21:39.675
Quite right. Quite right. Hear, hear.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.593
Order!

21:51.680 --> 21:54.240
The mercury vapour has been most effective.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.596
The rash is gone...
and all the other symptoms have subsided.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.195
I really am very pleased with the results,
Mr Schubert.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.272
Does that mean that I am cured?

22:04.440 --> 22:06.113
I make no guarantees, sir...

22:07.040 --> 22:10.954
.. but if the symptoms do not return,
then I think we may hope.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.476
May I ask, sir, if you are married?

22:17.720 --> 22:20.076
I am not married, no.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.913
It would be most unfortunate
if an innocent party were to be infected.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.714
And, of course, the children in such cases
can be terribly blighted.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.560
Mr Penge.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.279
I'm sorry to be disturbing you.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.318
I was wondering...

22:54.480 --> 22:56.597
if there is a chance of...

22:56.760 --> 22:59.719
maybe getting paid
a little earlier this quarter?

23:04.960 --> 23:09.557
Is this a joke, Miss Cleary,
some Hibernian attempt at humour?

23:09.720 --> 23:11.916
- No, sir.
- Then I fail to understand the question.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.914
I am the palace steward,
not the Bank of England.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.717
Mr Penge, I am begging you.

23:24.200 --> 23:30.549
I'm afraid, Miss Cleary, that you -
like so many of your compatriots -

23:30.720 --> 23:32.791
must learn to live within your means.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.598
<i>Dear Dr Traill, the Queen
writes with respect of your letter</i>

24:40.760 --> 24:43.832
<i>concerning the dreadful conditions
in your parish.</i>

24:46.120 --> 24:47.600
What is it, Robert?

24:48.600 --> 24:52.196
<i>She has been most affected
by your account of the suffering there.</i>

24:53.160 --> 24:57.439
<i>Therefore, she would be most grateful
if you were to come to Buckingham Palace</i>

24:57.600 --> 25:00.672
<i>so that you may furnish her
with a first-hand account</i>

25:00.840 --> 25:02.832
<i>of how the famine progresses...</i>

25:05.080 --> 25:07.072
<i>.. and what may be done</i>

25:07.240 --> 25:11.712
<i>to relieve the misfortunes
of her... most unfortunate people.</i>

26:16.960 --> 26:18.679
Is it a sweetheart?

26:19.920 --> 26:22.913
Let me tell you, Miss Cleary,
no man is worth it.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.392
Did you hear about the potato blight,
Mr Francatelli?

26:28.640 --> 26:32.429
Um... I know that you can't buy decent ones
at the moment for love nor money.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.160
In Ireland, potatoes are money.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.956
My family are smallholders.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.957
Without potatoes, they can't eat.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.833
They can't pay the rent.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.879
If they can't pay the rent,
they'll be evicted.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.714
And then I don't know
what'll happen to them.

26:59.440 --> 27:03.753
I've sent them everything
I have, Mr Francatelli.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.157
Everything.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.995
A lady friend gave this to me.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.879
Don't take less than 50 for it.
It's pure gold.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.800
I... I can't.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.429
She said it made me look
like a gentleman...

27:40.160 --> 27:44.074
.. but I think I'd rather be judged
by my actions than my appearance.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.030
You're a prince among men, Mr Francatelli.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.112
A prince!

27:52.160 --> 27:56.313
Oh... I'll settle for being someone
who's learnt how to do the right thing.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.678
It's gonna take years to repay you.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.797
I don't want your money, Miss Cleary.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.078
You're doing me a favour.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.032
Dr Traill.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.072
Thank you for coming to the palace.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.029
When I received your letter, Ma'am,
I knew the Lord had been listening to me.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.753
Please, do sit.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.953
Won't you have something to eat?

28:49.120 --> 28:51.555
I cannot eat, Ma'am, my heart is too full.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.592
I understand...

28:54.760 --> 28:58.515
or rather, I hope you will
help me to understand.

29:02.160 --> 29:06.951
I have spent my life studying the Bible,
Ma'am... but nothing has prepared me

29:07.120 --> 29:09.919
for what I see every morning
out of the window of the rectory.

29:10.080 --> 29:14.233
Grown men, staggering as if drunk,
but actually weak from starvation.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.278
Old people who turn away
what little nourishment they are offered

29:18.440 --> 29:20.716
because they would rather die
than be a burden.

29:20.880 --> 29:24.032
Babies screaming at their mother's breast
because she has no milk.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.554
What is even more terrible,

29:25.720 --> 29:28.189
is nothing is being done
to help these poor creatures.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.956
Do you know what I saw
on the boat coming over here?

29:32.560 --> 29:35.234
Bushels of grain
on its way to England to be sold.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.791
One of those sacks would have fed
the children in my parish for a week.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.712
How can that be, Ma'am?

29:42.560 --> 29:44.392
I am only a parson,
but I do not understand

29:44.560 --> 29:48.315
how a country where famine is stalking
the land can send food abroad.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.072
And I am the Queen...

29:53.000 --> 29:54.992
.. and I too do not understand.

30:02.880 --> 30:07.432
Albert, this is Dr Traill,
who has come to the palace at my request.

30:07.600 --> 30:12.550
Oh, the gentleman who has been writing
so eloquently to the newspapers. Good day.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.473
- Sir.
- As I understand it, Dr Traill,

30:14.640 --> 30:19.032
these shortages, they are endemic - an
inevitable result of relying on one crop.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.193
I don't think you can blame the Irish
for the potato blight, Albert.

30:22.360 --> 30:26.274
I think, Ma'am, I might have said
something similar a few years ago.

30:26.440 --> 30:30.275
I too believed the Catholics had only
themselves to blame for their misfortunes.

30:30.440 --> 30:34.719
I thought if I could bring them to the Church of
Ireland, they would learn to help themselves.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.794
The truth is... the reason the
Catholic peasantry are starving

30:38.960 --> 30:41.953
is because they have no legal right
to the land they farm.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.838
If they fall behind in their rent,
they are evicted without compensation

30:46.000 --> 30:47.992
for any improvements they have made.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.153
There's no wonder
they live from season to season.

30:51.320 --> 30:54.233
There is no reason
for them to be prudent, sir.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.995
So, what is it we can do, Dr Traill?

31:02.160 --> 31:04.914
Persuade your government
to send sustenance, Ma'am,

31:05.080 --> 31:09.120
or the people of my parish
will swell and ripen only for the grave.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.879
Your Honour.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.590
- Dr Traill is the Queen's guest, Miss Cleary.
- Cleary?

31:30.760 --> 31:33.594
- Are you..?
- Yes, sir. My family live in Schull.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.479
Please can you give them this?

31:35.640 --> 31:37.677
Tell them I will send more by Michaelmas.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.435
- It should be enough to pay the rent at least.
- I will.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.479
I'm sure Father O'Connell
will know where to find them.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.236
I don't know what you mean, sir.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.199
You mustn't be ashamed of who you are.
The Queen has given me money

31:54.360 --> 31:57.319
to help the people of Schull,
both Catholic and Protestant.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.951
It is your duty to help her understand
the country that she reigns over...

32:02.760 --> 32:04.114
Miss Cleary.

32:07.760 --> 32:12.437
But, Ma'am, if the government provides food,
we would be creating a country of dependents.

32:12.600 --> 32:16.230
Why should a man struggle to earn his living
while his neighbour lives in idleness?

32:16.400 --> 32:19.632
Thank you, Mr Trevelyan.
You may leave us.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.677
I will not stand by while
the Irish die of hunger!

32:36.800 --> 32:38.996
I cannot have it on my conscience.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.632
Sir Robert, remember Corinthians 13.

32:41.800 --> 32:44.599
"And now abideth faith, hope, charity...

32:45.920 --> 32:47.718
.. the greatest of these is charity."

32:47.880 --> 32:53.000
You must believe that I have examined
my own conscience most rigorously, Ma'am.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.712
Come with me, Sir Robert.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.029
Come on!

33:35.120 --> 33:37.032
Look at this child, Sir Robert.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.031
Look at Alice.

33:40.200 --> 33:44.114
Can you imagine what it must be like
to be a mother in Dr Traill's parish,

33:44.280 --> 33:46.431
who knows that she has no milk to give?

33:47.560 --> 33:50.029
And the crying will grow
weaker and weaker...

33:50.200 --> 33:52.157
<i>.. and weaker...</i>

33:54.160 --> 33:56.152
<i>.. until one day it stops.</i>

33:58.240 --> 33:59.913
<i>Charity begins at home, Sir Robert.</i>

34:00.080 --> 34:04.393
It begins here in the
nursery and as a mother.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.597
I will not let my people starve.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.159
You want to turn this house
into a soup kitchen?

34:18.719 --> 34:20.199
What about the children?

34:21.159 --> 34:22.753
There's fever in the village.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.719
Robert, do you want to visit the plague
on your own family?

34:25.880 --> 34:30.079
No. I think you and the children
should go to your mother's in Dublin.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.040
You would banish me and the children
from our home?

34:34.199 --> 34:38.194
- It is my sacred duty, Anne.
- What about your duty to your family?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.793
I cannot pass by on the other side, Anne.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.034
I know.

34:51.199 --> 34:55.034
But if I go to Dublin, I will not return.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.479
My place is here.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.712
When I first met you, Sir Robert...

35:15.760 --> 35:18.798
.. I confess, I did not find you congenial.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.199
I remember, Ma'am.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.114
But since then,
what I've come to understand...

35:28.000 --> 35:30.037
.. you are a man of principle.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.635
Well, I'm afraid that principles
are a luxury in a Prime Minister.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.791
If I follow my conscience...

35:42.360 --> 35:44.636
.. I will destroy my party.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.557
As a monarch, I can only advise...

36:06.800 --> 36:09.076
.. but as a mother...

36:10.800 --> 36:13.759
.. I implore you, Sir Robert,
listen to your conscience.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.917
Men think mothers are
great eiderdowns of comfort, but...

36:19.240 --> 36:21.232
.. we are fierce.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.991
I would do anything to protect my children.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.632
When I first met you, Ma'am...

36:34.040 --> 36:36.635
.. I wondered whether
such a young woman...

36:37.360 --> 36:40.353
was capable of fulfilling
the duties of a monarch.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.232
But since that time...

36:45.280 --> 36:48.557
.. I've come to appreciate
your strength of purpose.

36:49.480 --> 36:52.154
First impressions are
misleading, Sir Robert.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.118
Indeed they are, Ma'am.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.317
There must be
no barriers to hygiene.

37:40.480 --> 37:46.272
That is why I have asked Mr Chadwick here to
install a water closet in the servants' quarters.

37:46.440 --> 37:49.831
One day I hope that all
households will have...

37:51.280 --> 37:53.749
.. a throne of their own.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.198
Please.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.312
Thank you.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.073
- Good day.
- Thank you, sir.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.232
Good day to all.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.072
Shall we begin?

38:34.400 --> 38:37.120
First, we should discuss
how to deal with the Queen's...

38:37.280 --> 38:40.591
Excuse me, my lord.
We are to be joined by one more.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.553
I have asked Father O'Connell to join us.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.515
You'll never get to Dublin now, Traill.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.472
Now, gentlemen...

39:33.000 --> 39:34.753
.. what is to be done?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.792
Your Majesty?

39:58.160 --> 40:00.800
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
for disturbing you,

40:00.960 --> 40:04.271
but I was just wanting to say
that you did a splendid thing...

40:04.440 --> 40:06.159
sending for Dr Traill.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.159
- You know him?
- I know of him, Ma'am.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.915
I come from Schull, where he's the rector.

40:18.600 --> 40:20.193
But I am not of his church.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.311
I wanted this position so badly.

40:30.160 --> 40:33.119
I have no objection to Catholics
in the household.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.640
God bless you, Ma'am.

40:39.080 --> 40:40.639
Tell me...

40:43.840 --> 40:45.320
.. how is your family?

40:45.480 --> 40:47.517
Gone to America, Ma'am.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.951
I sent them money to pay the rent...

40:53.720 --> 40:56.599
.. but it was too late,
and they were evicted.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.674
So my father decided to emigrate.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.791
They sail from Cork next week.

41:05.920 --> 41:09.391
My mother says they'll write
when they're settled, but...

41:10.120 --> 41:12.191
America's so far away.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.511
Miss Cleary!

41:24.160 --> 41:26.231
I am sorry, Your Majesty,
for the disturbance.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.392
It's all right, Lehzen.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.079
Thank you for confiding in me.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.836
I did not know she was a Catholic
when I offered her the position.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.312
As if that matters.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.272
Bless you.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.592
Bless you.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.751
God bless you.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.799
Bless you.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.997
Surely we must be ready for a famine,

42:54.160 --> 42:56.152
whether it comes or not!

42:59.040 --> 43:04.035
Are we to sit in cabinet
and consider and calculate

43:04.200 --> 43:08.274
how much dysentery and diarrhoea
a people can take

43:08.440 --> 43:12.514
before it becomes necessary
for us to provide them with food?
