00:14.680 --> 00:16.600
The biggest living thing

00:16.600 --> 00:19.360
that exists on this planet
is a plant...

00:21.240 --> 00:24.000
..like this giant sequoia tree
in California.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.760
Plants, whether they are enormous,
like this one,

00:31.760 --> 00:35.360
or microscopic,
are the basis of all life,

00:35.360 --> 00:37.680
including ourselves.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.920
We depend upon them for
every mouthful of food that we eat

00:41.920 --> 00:45.040
and every lung full of air
that we breathe.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.760
Plants flourish
in remarkable ways,

00:51.760 --> 00:54.040
yet, for the most part,

00:54.040 --> 00:58.240
the secrets of their world
have been hidden from us...

00:58.240 --> 01:00.040
..until now.

01:06.800 --> 01:12.120
Now we have new ground-breaking
technology that enables us

01:12.120 --> 01:15.240
to enter their extraordinary
world

01:15.240 --> 01:17.680
and see their lives
from their perspective.

01:25.560 --> 01:29.920
This series will reveal
the extraordinary

01:29.920 --> 01:32.240
and dramatic ways in which
plants behave...

01:38.280 --> 01:41.360
..and we will explore
the challenges demanded by

01:41.360 --> 01:43.960
the very different landscapes
in which they live.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.880
The tropics.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.680
The richest
and most competitive place

01:53.680 --> 01:55.080
in which to survive.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.240
The bizarre water world...

02:03.920 --> 02:07.520
..where giants
fight ferocious battles,

02:07.520 --> 02:10.440
and plants eat animals alive.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.520
Deserts...

02:14.520 --> 02:16.240
Agh!

02:17.200 --> 02:19.560
A world of extremes.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.200
Seasonal lands...

02:28.760 --> 02:33.160
..where survival depends
on precision timing.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.960
And everywhere,
we will explore the critical

02:36.960 --> 02:41.840
and intimate relationships
between plants and animals,

02:41.840 --> 02:43.400
including ourselves.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.680
Join me in a world
that takes you by surprise...

02:59.960 --> 03:02.680
..and see our planet
as never before...

03:08.440 --> 03:11.040
..from
the plants' perspective.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.280
This is The Green Planet.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.240
I'm in Costa Rica,
in the heart of a rainforest,

04:03.240 --> 04:07.160
the richest and most dynamic
environment on Earth.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.160
Rainforests only cover
a very small proportion

04:11.160 --> 04:12.640
of the Earth's surface,

04:12.640 --> 04:15.520
yet they contain over half
of all known

04:15.520 --> 04:18.560
species of animals
and plants.

04:20.800 --> 04:26.360
Up here, the forest's canopy is
bathed by life-giving sunlight.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.480
The branches of the great trees

04:33.480 --> 04:36.080
carry rich, flourishing
sky gardens...

04:42.680 --> 04:46.440
..home to countless different
kinds of beautiful plants.

04:50.120 --> 04:54.520
Each species has evolved
its own exquisite solution

04:54.520 --> 04:56.880
to the challenges of survival.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.560
This forest world
may look peaceful,

05:05.560 --> 05:07.960
timeless and unchanging,

05:07.960 --> 05:12.120
but that is far from the truth.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.360
This is a battlefield.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.920
Throughout this forest,
plants are competing ferociously

05:22.920 --> 05:26.280
with one another
to claim the light.

05:28.920 --> 05:33.040
The battle is at its fiercest
on the forest floor...

05:37.520 --> 05:40.280
..where only 2% of the sunlight
filters through.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.560
Plants here have to
bide their time.

05:51.120 --> 05:55.600
Their opportunity comes
when an old tree dies.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.360
When that happens,
sunlight floods the forest floor

06:03.360 --> 06:06.320
for the first time
in perhaps 100 years.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.040
The seedling's wait is over.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.600
It must now race skywards

06:35.600 --> 06:37.840
and claim a place
in the canopy.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.640
But it's not alone.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.840
Rivals are everywhere,

06:47.840 --> 06:50.240
each with its own
survival strategy.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.560
Some plants,
like this monstera,

07:06.560 --> 07:10.040
stretch out divided leaves
to collect what light they can.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.840
This vine is groping blindly
around with its tendrils.

07:25.840 --> 07:29.760
It attempts to reach the light
by hitching a ride.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.000
Its tendrils are highly
sensitive to touch.

07:41.560 --> 07:45.280
And a suitable target
is in range.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.920
Got it!

08:13.080 --> 08:14.920
The vine tightens its grip

08:14.920 --> 08:18.040
and begins to haul itself
upwards.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.240
But it's now overtaken

08:24.240 --> 08:27.640
by the forest's
fastest-growing tree.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.400
A young balsa.

08:36.160 --> 08:39.600
Its giant leaves are already
40cm across

08:39.600 --> 08:43.080
and are stealing the light
from its rivals below.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.680
But the balsa's battle
is not yet won.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.920
Other, different vines
are lying in wait.

09:03.720 --> 09:08.720
Each is armed with dozens
of claw-like hooks.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.320
If just one hook gets a grip,

09:15.320 --> 09:18.320
the vine will be able
to smother its victim.

09:51.520 --> 09:57.400
But the balsa is defended
by a shield of slippery hairs.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.080
The vine's hooks
just can't get a hold.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.120
The balsa brushes them aside...

10:11.120 --> 10:13.840
..and continues to rush
skywards...

10:21.600 --> 10:24.280
..leaving the losers
in its shadow

10:24.280 --> 10:26.080
to fight among themselves.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.560
This balsa has won its battle
for the light.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.360
And it's done so
in a little over a year.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.960
Most trees would have grown
an inch or so in that time,

10:48.960 --> 10:53.520
but this one is already
30 feet - 10 metres - tall.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.240
Balsas owe their success

11:01.240 --> 11:03.880
to the special character
of their wood.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.000
If this section of tree trunk
came from a hardwood tree,

11:09.000 --> 11:10.720
it would be really quite heavy.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.080
But as it is,

11:12.080 --> 11:13.720
it's from balsa,

11:13.720 --> 11:17.000
and it's really very light,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.040
and that's because of
its internal structure.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.880
Under the microscope,
balsawood looks like a honeycomb.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.480
It contains more air than wood,

11:31.480 --> 11:34.800
so, not only
can it grow very fast,

11:34.800 --> 11:38.840
but it gets the maximum height
for minimum weight.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.760
But fast growth needs
something else.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.360
Fuel...

11:45.360 --> 11:47.360
..and lots of it.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.480
That fuel is created
in a plant's leaves,

12:00.480 --> 12:02.400
as they soak up the sun.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.600
It's a process called
photosynthesis...

12:19.120 --> 12:24.760
..a chemical reaction that is
the basis of all life on Earth.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.520
Leaves are covered by thousands
of microscopic pores

12:34.520 --> 12:36.360
called stomata.

12:37.880 --> 12:41.760
When open, they extract
carbon dioxide from the air,

12:41.760 --> 12:43.880
and, using energy from the sun,

12:43.880 --> 12:47.800
combine it with nutrients
to build the plant's tissues.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.920
And critically for us,
the process releases the oxygen

12:55.920 --> 13:00.360
that we and all animals need
in order to breathe.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.720
But for plants,
there is a downside.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.240
These precious, energy-packed
leaves attract predators...

13:20.880 --> 13:22.360
..in every shape...

13:23.880 --> 13:25.080
..size...

13:27.120 --> 13:29.360
..and agility.

13:41.840 --> 13:45.800
A sloth can only move slowly,

13:45.800 --> 13:49.440
but you don't need speed
to gather leaves,

13:49.440 --> 13:51.600
and it eats nothing else.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.840
The plants here are
under constant attack

14:13.840 --> 14:17.040
from all kinds of leaf-eaters,

14:17.040 --> 14:20.920
but the most voracious by far
is hardly ever seen.

14:22.800 --> 14:27.400
It consumes 50,000 leaves
every day.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.640
It's created this great clearing
in the forest...

14:32.000 --> 14:34.600
..and it lives
just beneath my feet.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.840
It's called leucoagaricus.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.840
It's neither animal nor plant.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.840
It's a fungus.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.040
It lives five metres
underground,

15:00.040 --> 15:02.400
far from the leaves
that it devours.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.920
To get them,

15:07.920 --> 15:11.320
it employs the best
leaf-gatherers in the tropics.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.280
Leafcutter ants.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.720
Millions of them provide
the fungus with its food,

15:28.720 --> 15:32.760
and in return, the fungus
cultivates tiny mushrooms

15:32.760 --> 15:34.440
as food for the ants.

15:40.280 --> 15:43.200
The fungus releases
chemical signals

15:43.200 --> 15:46.880
that tell the worker ants what
type of leaf it wants to eat.

15:49.640 --> 15:54.000
Scouts are sent out
with the latest orders.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.880
Worker ants will travel
hundreds of metres

16:03.880 --> 16:05.360
to find the right kind.

16:08.440 --> 16:12.000
Today's crop is being taken
from a young bixa tree.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.040
Just a few years old and
still battling to reach the canopy,

16:19.040 --> 16:21.560
it can ill afford to lose
any of its leaves.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.120
Between them, the ants can
demolish a large leaf

16:44.120 --> 16:45.680
in a matter of minutes.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.440
The sound of cutting attracts
more ants.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.880
Now the pieces are carried back
to the underground fungus.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.800
The ants can run at speeds
of two metres a minute.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.040
And each can carry a load
ten times its own weight.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.600
It's a river of leaves
across the jungle floor...

17:50.480 --> 17:54.400
..part of a vast network
that extends for miles

17:54.400 --> 17:55.760
through the forest.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.440
To avoid congestion,

18:06.440 --> 18:09.400
worker ants dig trenches
around obstacles.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.360
Thousands of pieces
are delivered every hour

18:40.360 --> 18:42.000
to the waiting fungus.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.200
Fed by
such a continuous supply,

18:57.200 --> 18:59.120
the fungus grows rapidly,

18:59.120 --> 19:01.880
filling the chambers
in which it lives...

19:04.800 --> 19:08.200
..so, the ants excavate
more space.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.800
It seems that the fungus
has the upper hand...

19:17.040 --> 19:20.560
..and the bixa tree
will not survive.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.480
But it fights back...

19:30.080 --> 19:32.800
..using chemical warfare.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.920
The bixa tree floods its leaves
with toxins

19:38.920 --> 19:42.080
that could kill
the distant fungus.

19:43.680 --> 19:47.480
As the ants carry the fragments
back, they are themselves

19:47.480 --> 19:50.080
poisoning the fungus
on the tree's behalf.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
It's a long-distance attack.

20:05.640 --> 20:09.080
As the poison takes effect,
the ants sense

20:09.080 --> 20:11.040
that their fungus
is weakening...

20:21.960 --> 20:24.400
..and they respond
to its signals

20:24.400 --> 20:27.400
by changing to another
source of leaves.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.560
So, the plant's
chemical response

20:34.560 --> 20:40.640
forces the ants to constantly
switch from tree to tree.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.680
Strike and counterstrike.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.840
And that ensures that enough
leaves remain uneaten

20:54.840 --> 20:57.320
for each tree to recover.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.600
Once a plant becomes adult,

21:15.600 --> 21:17.640
it can switch its energies

21:17.640 --> 21:20.400
from growth to reproduction.

21:26.120 --> 21:30.400
The tropical forests of the Americas
stretch from Mexico

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
to the southern reaches
of the Amazon.

21:33.680 --> 21:39.960
They contain more than 100,000
different species of plants,

21:39.960 --> 21:43.600
each with its own particular
survival strategy.

21:45.880 --> 21:50.520
One species that has adopted
a grow-fast lifestyle

21:50.520 --> 21:53.840
flourishes throughout
this vast region.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.920
The balsa.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.880
But it has to pay a high price
for doing so.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.720
The lightweight wood
that enables it

22:05.720 --> 22:08.400
to grow at such speed
is not strong

22:08.400 --> 22:10.240
and is easily broken.

22:11.960 --> 22:15.120
Few balsas live
longer than 20 years.

22:17.320 --> 22:20.680
This one is approaching
the end of its brief life,

22:20.680 --> 22:24.720
so, the time has come for it
to reproduce.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.520
It has used a huge amount
of energy to produce

22:34.520 --> 22:37.800
some of the most extravagant flowers
in the forest,

22:37.800 --> 22:39.720
in immense numbers.

22:48.640 --> 22:52.120
Each is the size
of a human hand.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.400
As night falls,

22:59.400 --> 23:01.640
the tree prepares
an enticing treat.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.000
This is a kinkajou,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.480
a kind of fruit-eating racoon.

23:20.760 --> 23:24.400
Each flower is filled
with huge quantities

23:24.400 --> 23:27.120
of exceptionally rich nectar,

23:27.120 --> 23:28.960
supercharged with sugar.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.840
Irresistible!

23:48.040 --> 23:50.800
The kinkajous drink so greedily

23:50.800 --> 23:54.000
that they get pollen
all over their faces.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.560
So, as they move
from tree to tree,

23:59.560 --> 24:01.640
they carry pollen with them.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.240
But the balsa
leaves little to chance.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.960
The nectar might appear
to have run out,

24:15.960 --> 24:18.280
but this is just
the first round.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.160
Now the balsa refills
its flowers,

24:23.160 --> 24:27.160
enticing the kinkajous back
to repeat the process...

24:27.160 --> 24:28.920
..seven times a night.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.280
Pollination is complete.

24:37.720 --> 24:41.200
And the kinkajous -
they also get well served,

24:41.200 --> 24:44.720
with over 100 pints of nectar
in just a few weeks.

24:49.600 --> 24:53.800
Both plant and animal do well
out of this arrangement.

24:56.480 --> 25:00.880
But in the tropical world,
that isn't always so.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.880
Borneo.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.160
Here, on the slopes
of Mount Kinabalu,

25:16.160 --> 25:19.200
live plants that eat animals

25:19.200 --> 25:22.200
using pitcher-shaped leaves
full of water.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.080
Insects are attracted
by the expectation of nectar,

25:35.080 --> 25:37.680
but tumble into the pitcher,

25:37.680 --> 25:40.840
where they are drowned
and absorbed.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.480
On the lower slopes
of the mountain,

25:48.480 --> 25:51.240
a plant grows
that has no leaves at all.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.400
Or even a stem.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.760
All that can be seen is this -

25:59.760 --> 26:01.080
a bud.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.160
It is a parasite.

26:18.280 --> 26:23.400
The rest of its body lies
within the tissues of a liana,

26:23.400 --> 26:25.120
on which it feeds.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.600
After about five years,

26:31.600 --> 26:36.280
the bud finally opens
into a monstrous flower.

26:38.680 --> 26:43.120
It now has only a day or so
in which to be pollinated

26:43.120 --> 26:45.280
before it starts to wither.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.400
Its petals are
the colour of blood.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.480
Their surface is tough
and warty.

27:01.160 --> 27:03.000
It appears to have fur.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.760
Even whiskers and teeth.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.240
At first sight, it might be
mistaken for a dead animal.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.520
This is rafflesia,
the corpse flower.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.800
A metre across,
it's the world's biggest flower.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.640
And this one is a male.

27:41.160 --> 27:45.320
From its centre comes
the pungent odour of death.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.880
It's a scent that might not appeal
to every animal.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.720
But it's very attractive
to carrion flies.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.120
They lay their eggs
on rotting flesh.

28:24.560 --> 28:28.120
The scent lures the fly
deep into the flower

28:28.120 --> 28:30.000
in search of meat.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.960
The fly finds nothing.

28:38.960 --> 28:43.160
The rafflesia, however, has the fly
exactly where it wants it.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.280
It's stuck pollen
to the fly's back.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.560
If this male rafflesia's
strategy is to work,

29:06.560 --> 29:09.560
the fly carrying its pollen
must now visit

29:09.560 --> 29:11.160
a female corpse flower...

29:16.120 --> 29:17.920
..such as this one.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.400
Success!

29:47.560 --> 29:51.280
Once pollinated,
plants are able to produce seeds,

29:51.280 --> 29:53.320
the next generation,

29:53.320 --> 29:57.160
but once again, there are animals
all over the forest

29:57.160 --> 29:59.400
that are eager to make
a meal of them.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.720
The Malay Archipelago,

30:17.720 --> 30:21.080
a vast tropical world
of 1,000 islands.

30:29.880 --> 30:33.080
It's home to giants -

30:33.080 --> 30:35.640
the tallest trees
in the tropics,

30:35.640 --> 30:38.360
many of which live
for centuries.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.760
They produce seeds
in enormous numbers,

30:46.760 --> 30:49.320
but only do so
when the time is right.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.520
This individual hasn't produced
a single seed

30:56.520 --> 30:58.360
for nearly a decade,

30:58.360 --> 31:01.640
but in the last weeks,
it has become festooned

31:01.640 --> 31:03.640
with more than 10,000 of them.

31:08.120 --> 31:11.640
Each seed has the potential
to produce a giant,

31:11.640 --> 31:13.360
like its parent.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.480
But success will depend...

31:24.200 --> 31:25.680
..on timing.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.360
Seed-hunters are gathering.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.000
Bearded pigs.

31:55.280 --> 31:59.040
But these seeds have been
produced by a dipterocarp...

32:01.960 --> 32:04.400
..trees that create
the tropical world's

32:04.400 --> 32:06.080
largest seed nursery.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.720
After years of waiting,

32:14.720 --> 32:18.080
thousands upon thousands
of individual dipterocarps

32:18.080 --> 32:21.240
have synchronised to produce
the next generation,

32:21.240 --> 32:23.320
all at exactly the same time.

32:42.320 --> 32:46.080
And now these seeds will face
the dangers below together.

33:32.640 --> 33:36.760
By releasing billions of seeds
all at the same time,

33:36.760 --> 33:40.080
they swamp the pigs
and any other animals

33:40.080 --> 33:42.360
with more than they could
possibly eat.

34:03.960 --> 34:09.080
And that buys time for
some of the seeds to take root

34:09.080 --> 34:10.920
and sprout.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.920
The tree's strategy has worked.

34:39.920 --> 34:44.040
But a seedling will have to overcome
many more dangers

34:44.040 --> 34:47.560
over the years if it, too,
is to become a giant.

34:54.200 --> 34:57.200
And there are many ways
in a tropical forest

34:57.200 --> 34:59.720
by which a tree's life
can be ended

34:59.720 --> 35:02.080
before it reaches its prime.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.760
The northernmost tip
of Australia.

35:12.480 --> 35:15.960
This is the world's
most ancient rainforest.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.400
Battles between animals
and plants

35:36.400 --> 35:40.240
have raged here
for 180 million years.

35:47.400 --> 35:51.240
So, the plants have had time
to develop effective defences.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.880
This is a poison arrow tree,

35:56.880 --> 36:00.360
one of the tropical world's
most heavily defended plants.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.840
Its trunk is tall and slippery

36:06.840 --> 36:08.760
and exudes a poisonous sap.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.600
It appears to be
almost invulnerable.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.600
But even so,

36:24.600 --> 36:27.760
just as this individual
reaches maturity,

36:27.760 --> 36:29.960
its life has become endangered.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.400
Each monsoon season,

36:37.400 --> 36:40.080
it is invaded from above.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.560
It attracts
hundreds of shining starlings.

36:53.240 --> 36:57.280
Its immense smooth trunk
makes its high branches above

36:57.280 --> 36:59.800
a safe place to nest,

36:59.800 --> 37:01.440
but over the years,

37:01.440 --> 37:04.000
this has created
a major problem for the tree.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.120
After feeding, the starlings
return to the nest

37:12.120 --> 37:14.280
to digest their food,

37:14.280 --> 37:16.880
with inevitable consequences.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.600
Every year,

37:23.600 --> 37:27.720
they produce almost a quarter
of a ton of droppings.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.160
The toxic chemicals
they contain

37:33.160 --> 37:36.440
create a dead zone that
completely surrounds the tree.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.200
The toxins are absorbed
by its roots

37:47.200 --> 37:50.600
and travel up through the trunk
and into every leaf.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.880
Branch by branch,

38:08.880 --> 38:11.480
the tree is slowly dying.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.920
It has become a victim
of its own success.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.520
It has been poisoned.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.600
Now a new battle begins...

38:34.080 --> 38:36.800
..one to claim the tree's
dead body

38:36.800 --> 38:40.320
and the vast amount of nutrients
that it contains.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.120
It's a battle that is fought
throughout the natural world...

38:46.400 --> 38:48.480
..involving a group
of organisms

38:48.480 --> 38:49.960
that we rarely notice.

38:52.560 --> 38:56.160
Here, on the floor
of a tropical rainforest,

38:56.160 --> 38:58.960
it's dark, it's humid

38:58.960 --> 39:00.640
and it's hot -

39:00.640 --> 39:04.040
ideal conditions for fungi.

39:04.040 --> 39:07.920
We normally think of fungi
as things like this.

39:07.920 --> 39:10.320
Mushrooms of one kind
or another.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.760
But these are just
the fruiting bodies.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.920
They exist for most of the time

39:17.920 --> 39:20.520
hidden in the leaf litter
and the earth

39:20.520 --> 39:22.840
as a network
of fine white threads.

39:25.160 --> 39:29.720
The threads of competing fungi
envelop their victim's body,

39:29.720 --> 39:33.440
releasing enzymes which digest
the tree's tissues

39:33.440 --> 39:35.960
and unlock the nutrients within.

39:38.600 --> 39:42.120
There a million or so
different species of fungi

39:42.120 --> 39:44.400
in the tropics.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.640
Some feed on dead plants.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.400
Others eat them alive.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.480
And some reveal their existence
in an eerily beautiful way.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.840
In Africa, in the Congo,

40:07.840 --> 40:10.760
this is known
as chimpanzee fire.

40:16.520 --> 40:19.480
The mysterious
bioluminescent glow

40:19.480 --> 40:23.120
becomes brighter as the fungus
digests the tree.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.800
When fungi have fed
sufficiently,

40:30.800 --> 40:33.240
they develop
their reproductive organs.

41:02.600 --> 41:06.720
Each can produce
literally billions of spores...

41:09.000 --> 41:10.560
..the tiny particles

41:10.560 --> 41:12.800
that carry the species'
genetic blueprint.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.720
Each spore like this

41:17.720 --> 41:20.240
has the potential
to kill a tree.

41:43.240 --> 41:45.000
The spores are so light

41:45.000 --> 41:47.680
they can be carried by
the slightest air currents.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.120
At least a billion

41:59.120 --> 42:02.080
float above every square metre
of rainforest.

42:12.040 --> 42:15.200
Recently, it has been
discovered that these spores

42:15.200 --> 42:18.600
do far more than just
bring death and decay.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.440
They are, in fact,
at the very centre

42:24.440 --> 42:27.040
of the rainforest's
life support system.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.960
High in the humid air,

42:36.960 --> 42:39.840
the spores combine
with molecules of water.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.640
Gradually,
they collect into droplets,

42:56.640 --> 42:59.840
which,
when they are heavy enough, fall...

43:02.280 --> 43:03.760
..as rain.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.880
Over two-and-a-half metres
of rain falls every year

43:46.880 --> 43:48.680
in a rainforest.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.440
And in the centre
of almost every raindrop,

43:59.440 --> 44:01.200
there is a fungal spore.

44:16.680 --> 44:19.800
The world's rainforests
are the richest

44:19.800 --> 44:22.960
and most dynamic environments
on Earth,

44:22.960 --> 44:26.840
built on complex connections
and relationships.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.640
But these connections,

44:32.640 --> 44:35.280
competitive or collaborative,

44:35.280 --> 44:37.840
are now becoming
increasingly fragile.

44:53.800 --> 44:58.080
When Charles Darwin was exploring
the tropical world

44:58.080 --> 45:00.320
nearly 200 years ago,

45:00.320 --> 45:03.480
he wrote this in his diary.

45:03.480 --> 45:08.200
"Among the scenes which are
deeply impressed on my mind,

45:08.200 --> 45:11.520
"none exceed in sublimity

45:11.520 --> 45:16.840
"the primeval forests
undefaced by the hand of man."

45:18.520 --> 45:21.440
He would struggle to find
such a place today.

45:36.520 --> 45:41.080
Today, 70% of all the world's
rainforest plants

45:41.080 --> 45:44.320
grow within a mile of a road
or a clearing

45:44.320 --> 45:47.520
that we have cut into the forest...

45:50.920 --> 45:54.120
..and this is creating
new battlefields

45:54.120 --> 45:55.840
in the tropical world.

45:58.080 --> 46:01.640
Alien armies of identical
cultivated plants

46:01.640 --> 46:05.480
now stand where thousands
of different species once grew.

46:14.400 --> 46:17.640
We have planted
vast regiments of crops

46:17.640 --> 46:20.160
in order to provide ourselves

46:20.160 --> 46:22.360
with food
and other commodities...

46:24.400 --> 46:27.000
..and the ancient forest
has been reduced

46:27.000 --> 46:29.720
to ever fewer isolated fragments.

46:34.360 --> 46:36.240
All, however, is not lost.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.880
The fragments
can still be sanctuaries,

46:40.880 --> 46:44.080
keeping alive the intimate
relationships within them.

46:46.520 --> 46:49.600
Their size is
nonetheless critical.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.960
This is the seven-hour flower.

47:13.360 --> 47:17.040
This plant produces its flowers
at night.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.800
They open about six o'clock,

47:19.800 --> 47:24.440
and each blossom only lasts
that night.

47:24.440 --> 47:27.080
It opens for about seven hours

47:27.080 --> 47:29.520
and then it dies.

47:29.520 --> 47:32.120
But during that time,
it provides food

47:32.120 --> 47:33.840
for one particular animal.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.760
A bat.

47:36.760 --> 47:38.160
And here it is!

47:56.800 --> 47:59.840
During the seven-hour flower's
flowering season...

48:01.520 --> 48:04.880
..Underwood's bat feeds
almost exclusively on its nectar.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.680
It is the plant's
primary pollinator.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.280
It might seem that this is

48:16.280 --> 48:19.200
a fairly evenly balanced
relationship,

48:19.200 --> 48:20.560
but not so.

48:21.880 --> 48:26.120
The bat likes this nectar
because it's sweet,

48:26.120 --> 48:29.520
but it's not very nourishing.

48:29.520 --> 48:32.480
So the bat must visit
hundreds of flowers a night...

48:35.400 --> 48:37.600
..and it pollinates them
as if feeds.

48:45.400 --> 48:48.880
But if a patch of forest
becomes too small,

48:48.880 --> 48:50.680
with too few flowers,

48:50.680 --> 48:52.800
the bats will disappear,

48:52.800 --> 48:56.280
and without the bats,
the flowers can't reproduce

48:56.280 --> 48:57.920
and will soon die out.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.120
The partnership is broken.

49:12.560 --> 49:17.040
Life in the forest depends on
countless close relationships,

49:17.040 --> 49:19.800
but they are increasingly
under threat

49:19.800 --> 49:23.440
as forests become more fragmented.

49:23.440 --> 49:24.920
The solution, of course,

49:24.920 --> 49:27.640
is to join these remaining
fragments together again.

49:28.880 --> 49:32.000
30 years ago,
I came to this exact spot.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.720
This land belonged to

49:35.720 --> 49:37.840
a scientific research
establishment

49:37.840 --> 49:41.520
and it was covered with grass
being grazed by cattle.

49:41.520 --> 49:44.520
The scientists
got rid of the cattle

49:44.520 --> 49:47.800
and allowed nature
to take its course.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.560
Just look at it now!

49:58.920 --> 50:01.880
This new forest
has become a bridge

50:01.880 --> 50:04.840
that connects several fragments,

50:04.840 --> 50:09.280
allowing plants and animals
to both renew old connections

50:09.280 --> 50:11.120
and create fresh ones.

50:22.840 --> 50:26.320
Of course,
we urgently need to protect

50:26.320 --> 50:28.480
what healthy forests still remain.

50:33.040 --> 50:34.640
But looking forward,

50:34.640 --> 50:38.000
we must take what may well be
our last chance

50:38.000 --> 50:40.520
to re-establish
the lost rainforest...

50:44.320 --> 50:48.120
..and help the tropical world
to heal itself.

50:50.960 --> 50:55.480
It will take the co-operation
of nations around the world,

50:55.480 --> 50:58.760
but it is the only way in which
we'll be able to

50:58.760 --> 51:02.240
preserve the treasures
of the tropical rainforest

51:02.240 --> 51:04.560
for future generations.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.600
And with it,

51:06.600 --> 51:10.200
ultimately protect all life
on this,

51:10.200 --> 51:13.000
our green planet.

51:29.120 --> 51:32.840
The aim of The Green Planet team
was to take the viewer

51:32.840 --> 51:35.640
into the world of plants,
so that it could be seen

51:35.640 --> 51:37.400
from the plants' perspective

51:37.400 --> 51:39.600
in a way that had not been
possible till now.

51:41.840 --> 51:45.040
That meant developing
an entirely new camera system.

51:51.560 --> 51:54.440
And this is the game-changer -

51:54.440 --> 51:57.480
a specially designed
robot camera

51:57.480 --> 52:00.120
that we affectionately call
"the Triffid".

52:05.080 --> 52:08.240
The Triffid started life
in the garage of an American

52:08.240 --> 52:11.040
ex-military engineer,
Chris Field.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.520
I'd seen quite a few of these

52:12.520 --> 52:14.720
Planet Earth style
documentaries,

52:14.720 --> 52:16.520
and they always absolutely
blew my mind,

52:16.520 --> 52:19.840
especially the botanic time-lapse
really spoke to me.

52:19.840 --> 52:22.760
In his spare time,
Chris spent a decade

52:22.760 --> 52:25.240
building elaborate
motion-controlled

52:25.240 --> 52:27.400
time-lapse camera rigs

52:27.400 --> 52:30.960
and teaching himself
how to film plants.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.840
Plants often behave like
animals in so many ways,

52:34.840 --> 52:37.480
and being able to see it
through time-lapse is one thing

52:37.480 --> 52:40.720
but using the motion-control
brings you into that timescale.

52:45.480 --> 52:47.560
We could really see the potential

52:47.560 --> 52:49.560
in how we could use
this sort of movement

52:49.560 --> 52:51.560
to bring plants alive

52:51.560 --> 52:54.040
and film them in the same way
that we film animals.

52:56.320 --> 52:58.240
Soon, Chris joins the team

52:58.240 --> 53:00.840
in a quiet corner
of the Devon countryside

53:00.840 --> 53:03.800
and the robot army begins
to take shape.

53:05.560 --> 53:08.080
After 40 years
of filming time-lapse,

53:08.080 --> 53:11.440
these rigs have opened up
a whole new world for us.

53:12.720 --> 53:15.840
So, it'll be like
hovering around something

53:15.840 --> 53:18.520
with a drone or helicopter,
but in a time-lapse speed.

53:20.600 --> 53:24.040
The holy grail for us is being
able to take this technology

53:24.040 --> 53:27.400
out into the wild, try and get
the same sorts of dynamic moves

53:27.400 --> 53:30.120
in some of the most extreme
environments in the world.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.280
So, what we needed to do

53:34.280 --> 53:37.240
was to develop this technology
even further.

53:37.240 --> 53:39.760
Six months later,
the Triffid is born...

53:42.520 --> 53:47.400
..and with slight trepidation,
they hand me the controls.

53:47.400 --> 53:50.360
That makes it go away.

53:50.360 --> 53:53.160
And this makes it come back.

53:53.160 --> 53:55.760
And this sends it up.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.440
Ooh!

54:01.680 --> 54:04.440
I think I'd better hand it over
to the experts.

54:06.520 --> 54:09.080
Now it's time to put
this new member of the team

54:09.080 --> 54:10.800
properly through its paces.

54:13.480 --> 54:16.280
The aim here is for Ollie
to find a target, aim for it

54:16.280 --> 54:18.720
and fly through it,
as if he is a tiny fly

54:18.720 --> 54:21.120
going through a hole in a leaf.

54:21.120 --> 54:23.360
Easier said than done.

54:23.360 --> 54:25.600
Oops!
I'm trying to find a target.

54:27.320 --> 54:31.240
Whether the kit's going to
stand up to that sort of use

54:31.240 --> 54:34.040
and the abuse that we throw
at most pieces of kit

54:34.040 --> 54:35.600
has yet to be seen.

54:35.600 --> 54:39.160
In the studio, it seems to be
working pretty well.

54:39.160 --> 54:41.760
But this is only
a dress rehearsal.

54:41.760 --> 54:44.400
It's time for the Triffid
to face the challenges

54:44.400 --> 54:46.840
of the Costa Rican rainforest,

54:46.840 --> 54:48.760
and leafcutter ants.

54:55.400 --> 54:58.720
We want to film their journey
all the way

54:58.720 --> 55:02.200
down the trunk
and along this buttress root

55:02.200 --> 55:03.680
and down to their nest.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.720
The team and the Triffid
need several days

55:07.720 --> 55:09.200
of dry weather,

55:09.200 --> 55:11.800
but a storm can hit
at any moment...

55:13.000 --> 55:15.560
..and rain is one thing
the Triffid does not like.

55:17.920 --> 55:20.160
The conditions
that we're working in now

55:20.160 --> 55:22.720
are a little bit more
challenging than the studio.

55:24.520 --> 55:27.080
All the ground is really bumpy.

55:27.080 --> 55:29.080
We've got loads of plants
in the way.

55:29.080 --> 55:31.360
I know we're making a series
about plants,

55:31.360 --> 55:33.920
but sometimes they're
a complete pain in the neck!

55:36.080 --> 55:38.520
The Triffid needs to be
programmed

55:38.520 --> 55:42.320
to capture images from 7,000
different camera positions

55:42.320 --> 55:43.640
on the ants' trail.

55:46.120 --> 55:48.280
Just one drop of rain
on the lens,

55:48.280 --> 55:49.480
or a wobble,

55:49.480 --> 55:52.680
and the whole process
will have to start again.

55:52.680 --> 55:55.560
I think this is when
we're going to find out

55:55.560 --> 55:58.080
if our ambition
outweighs our ability.

56:01.800 --> 56:04.120
For the crew,
the ambition is certainly high.

56:07.640 --> 56:10.480
Fortunately, it's all down
to the Triffid now.

56:20.320 --> 56:23.560
We've been filming the ants
with the Triffid

56:23.560 --> 56:27.240
for eight days now,
and we're on our third set-up.

56:27.240 --> 56:29.240
It's pretty slow going.

56:30.320 --> 56:33.480
While the Triffid seems to be
handling the pressure well,

56:33.480 --> 56:37.200
for the crew, trying to take
a tree's-eye view of ants

56:37.200 --> 56:39.520
is turning into
a bit of a nightmare.

56:41.400 --> 56:45.520
Wake up, film ants,
go to sleep, dream of ants.

56:45.520 --> 56:48.640
Wake up, film ants, sleep,
dream of ants.

56:48.640 --> 56:50.400
Wake up, film ants,

56:50.400 --> 56:53.120
go to sleep, dream of ants.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.160
After two weeks in the jungle,

56:58.160 --> 57:01.320
ambition and ability
finally come together,

57:01.320 --> 57:03.600
for the Triffid, at least.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.240
Thousands of individual images

57:06.240 --> 57:08.680
creating a single
extraordinary time-lapse...

57:11.560 --> 57:14.000
..one that follows
a river of leaves

57:14.000 --> 57:16.840
across the jungle floor
from a unique perspective.

57:21.920 --> 57:24.600
For the Triffid,
this was just the beginning.

57:27.200 --> 57:29.080
Take a bow, Triffid.

57:34.920 --> 57:37.840
Next time on The Green Planet...

57:37.840 --> 57:40.600
..the wonder of water worlds...

57:42.960 --> 57:45.240
..where plants hunt...

57:46.920 --> 57:48.560
..go on the move...

57:49.920 --> 57:51.040
..fight...

57:52.720 --> 57:54.920
..and create the air we breathe.

57:57.920 --> 58:01.360
The Open University
have produced a poster

58:01.360 --> 58:06.040
that explores the vital role
that plants have for our planet.
