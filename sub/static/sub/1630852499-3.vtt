00:02.753 --> 00:03.694
- Chapter Three.

00:03.794 --> 00:05.456
As the younger
Hayworth siblings

00:05.556 --> 00:07.178
wrestled with all that life
had recently thrown at them,

00:07.278 --> 00:09.980
Connor newly separated,
Sarah still unemployed,

00:10.080 --> 00:12.263
it fell to Tom to provide
the steady guiding hand

00:12.363 --> 00:13.424
the family needed.

00:13.524 --> 00:15.185
Hey, guys?
Guys?

00:15.285 --> 00:17.307
Let's keep it down
for the neighbors, okay?

00:17.407 --> 00:20.510
Remember how we talked
about our inside voices?

00:20.610 --> 00:23.473
Let's go ahead
and use those outside too.

00:23.573 --> 00:25.315
- Maybe we should just do
brunch at my place every week.

00:25.415 --> 00:26.516
It's funner
for the kids that way.

00:26.616 --> 00:28.638
- No, it's "more fun."

00:28.738 --> 00:30.200
- So we agree.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.081
- With Connor's marital woes
still fresh,

00:32.181 --> 00:34.604
everyone found themselves
tiptoeing around the subject.

00:34.704 --> 00:39.609
- So Connor, how's it going
with, you know?

00:39.709 --> 00:41.410
- It's okay, I guess.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.893
Me and Emily finally
worked out the custody sitch.

00:43.993 --> 00:45.414
She got a place nearby,

00:45.514 --> 00:46.896
so Gretchen's gonna stay there
half the week.

00:46.996 --> 00:48.857
- But Gretchen still
doesn't know you're separated?

00:48.957 --> 00:50.038
- No, we're waiting for Emily
to get back in town

00:50.119 --> 00:51.140
and we're gonna
tell her together.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.301
We got the whole thing
planned out.

00:52.401 --> 00:53.502
We're gonna go to the beach,

00:53.602 --> 00:55.183
do a little pony ride, picnic.

00:55.283 --> 00:56.985
I even flew in
her favorite cake from Seattle.

00:57.085 --> 00:58.306
- Dude, I'm pretty sure
that sounds

00:58.406 --> 01:00.188
like a divorce reveal party.

01:00.288 --> 01:01.630
- Well, I'm sure he and Emily
thought it out.

01:01.730 --> 01:03.231
- Well, Tom's right.
I mean,

01:03.331 --> 01:05.193
Gretchen will associate all
of those things with divorce

01:05.293 --> 01:08.036
for the rest of her life
like, beach, divorce,

01:08.136 --> 01:09.837
ponies,
picnics, cake, divorce.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.679
- Plus cake at the beach
can be a real problem.

01:11.779 --> 01:13.561
You got the sand
and the big knife.

01:13.661 --> 01:16.844
And it's, like, I mean,
do you pre-slice?

01:16.944 --> 01:18.926
- Well, luckily, you're not
in charge of my family,

01:19.026 --> 01:20.167
so you don't have
to worry about it.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.489
- Okay, man.
I'm just trying to help.

01:21.589 --> 01:22.850
I don't think that's how you're
supposed to tell

01:22.950 --> 01:24.111
your daughter
that you're getting a divorce.

01:24.191 --> 01:25.012
- What?
You and Mom are getting

01:25.112 --> 01:26.453
a divorce?

01:26.553 --> 01:27.895
- Oh, Gretchen, honey...
- Oh, no.

01:27.995 --> 01:30.257
My god, Connor, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean...

01:30.357 --> 01:31.698
- Well, you did, so congrats.

01:31.798 --> 01:33.800
You just won the award
for worst uncle.

01:37.324 --> 01:39.706
- Technically, I'm
her only uncle, so, you know,

01:39.806 --> 01:41.428
it stands the reason,
if I'm the worst uncle,

01:41.528 --> 01:43.750
I'm also her--you know,
that's not the point.

01:43.850 --> 01:46.452
[upbeat music]

01:49.695 --> 01:50.877
- I can't believe I spilled
the beans like that

01:50.977 --> 01:52.978
in front of Gretchen.
I really blew it.

01:53.779 --> 01:55.601
Oh, this is when you're
supposed to chime in and say,

01:55.701 --> 01:57.883
"Oh, honey.
Don't beat yourself up."

01:57.983 --> 02:00.205
- Oh, honey.
Don't beat yourself up.

02:00.305 --> 02:01.327
- That's great.
Thanks.

02:01.427 --> 02:02.888
I feel better already.

02:02.988 --> 02:04.650
[phone vibrating]
Oh, this is him now.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.772
Hey, Connor,
I'm glad you called.

02:06.872 --> 02:08.453
- Hold on one sec.
I'm getting Sarah on.

02:08.553 --> 02:10.896
- Okay, look, I just
wanna apologize again

02:10.996 --> 02:12.297
about this morning.

02:12.397 --> 02:13.498
- Ah, I should have been
more careful

02:13.598 --> 02:15.020
with Gretchen nearby.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.382
- But still, I mean,
I just--I feel awful.

02:17.482 --> 02:18.743
- Oh, no,
you definitely should.

02:18.843 --> 02:19.904
Yeah, you definitely kept

02:20.004 --> 02:22.006
that conversation
going needlessly.

02:22.527 --> 02:24.429
- Cool, cool.
Yeah, just making sure.

02:24.529 --> 02:25.990
- Hey, Con.
I am so sorry

02:26.090 --> 02:28.152
about Tom this morning.

02:28.252 --> 02:30.154
That was so like him
to just blurt it out like that.

02:30.254 --> 02:32.596
- Tom's on.

02:32.696 --> 02:33.797
- I know.

02:33.897 --> 02:35.399
- Hey, so Gretchen seems

02:35.499 --> 02:38.002
to be taking the news,
like, really well.

02:38.102 --> 02:39.283
- Oh, really?
Wow.

02:39.383 --> 02:42.206
That was... quick,
but good, I guess, right?

02:42.306 --> 02:44.207
- Definitely, yeah, but I want
to make sure it stays that way,

02:44.307 --> 02:45.649
So I was thinking
maybe the cousins

02:45.749 --> 02:47.370
could come over tonight
for a little sleepover.

02:47.470 --> 02:50.614
- Oh, my guys would love that.
- Yeah, Camila too.

02:50.714 --> 02:51.815
- Great.
I'm going all out.

02:51.915 --> 02:53.496
And I know I use
the word epic a lot.

02:53.596 --> 02:54.657
- You really do.

02:54.757 --> 02:55.738
- I sent you that list

02:55.838 --> 02:57.300
of synonyms for it.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.062
- But tonight's sleepover
can only be described as epic.

02:59.162 --> 03:00.383
- Or top drawer.

03:00.483 --> 03:02.745
Remember, it was,
like, a fun British one?

03:02.845 --> 03:04.347
- Perfect.
I'll see you guys around six.

03:04.447 --> 03:06.188
- Lupe!

03:06.288 --> 03:08.190
There's a sleepover happening,
which means scary stories,

03:08.290 --> 03:09.752
so I need you to go
to the hardware store

03:09.852 --> 03:11.393
and buy a hook hand.

03:11.493 --> 03:13.495
It's like a hook,
but where your hand should be.

03:14.857 --> 03:17.039
- That's sweet of Connor
to do that for Gretchen.

03:17.139 --> 03:19.081
I'll take the kids
and stick around to help out.

03:19.181 --> 03:21.283
- Yeah, I'm gonna go too, try
to make up for this morning.

03:21.383 --> 03:23.285
- Okay, but remember, you know,

03:23.385 --> 03:25.166
he just wants a fun night
for Gretchen,

03:25.266 --> 03:27.749
so you shouldn't put
a damper on it.

03:28.189 --> 03:29.491
- What is that supposed
to mean?

03:29.591 --> 03:31.212
- Just, you know,
sometimes you worry

03:31.312 --> 03:32.614
and you can get in your head

03:32.714 --> 03:34.255
and sort of be a...

03:34.355 --> 03:35.336
Uh, what's the expression?

03:35.436 --> 03:37.098
It's not a party pooper.

03:37.198 --> 03:39.380
- I'm not a party pooper.
- I said not a party pooper.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.742
Wet blanket?
Wet blanket.

03:41.842 --> 03:44.305
- What are you talking about?
I'm a fun guy.

03:44.405 --> 03:45.666
I'm one of the top commenters

03:45.766 --> 03:47.508
on "New York Times"
crossword puzzle blog.

03:47.608 --> 03:50.230
Will Shortz once referred to me
as a "real character."

03:50.330 --> 03:51.752
Hey, you and your cousins
think I'm fun,

03:51.852 --> 03:53.634
right, like, a fun uncle?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.515
- Nah, Uncle Connor
is the fun one.

03:55.615 --> 03:58.518
He's always throwing us
onto things or off of things.

03:58.618 --> 04:01.001
- So let me get this right.
He's got more money.

04:01.101 --> 04:02.682
He's got a better house.
And now he's the fun one?

04:02.782 --> 04:04.644
No, no, that's it.
I'm definitely going tonight.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.527
I'm going to prove to you guys
that I'm a fun uncle, a funcle.

04:07.627 --> 04:09.929
[chuckles]
Funcle, it's like fun uncle.

04:10.029 --> 04:12.151
- Yeah, no, I got it.
- It's gonna be great.

04:13.312 --> 04:18.577
- [soft groaning]

04:18.677 --> 04:20.539
- What?
- What?

04:20.639 --> 04:22.501
- You're doing the...
[soft groaning]

04:22.601 --> 04:24.703
- Oh, it's nothing.

04:24.803 --> 04:28.267
- Okay.

04:28.367 --> 04:29.948
- I just don't think
that a party

04:30.048 --> 04:31.630
is what
Gretchen needs right now.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.433
You know, as a child therapist,
yes, currently unemployed,

04:34.533 --> 04:36.354
but still, I really think
that someone just needs

04:36.454 --> 04:39.077
to talk to her
about how she's feeling.

04:39.177 --> 04:41.079
- You are so right,
but this party

04:41.179 --> 04:42.520
probably isn't
the best place to do that,

04:42.620 --> 04:43.761
and when I say probably,

04:43.861 --> 04:45.323
please know
that I mean definitely.

04:45.423 --> 04:47.605
- I hear you, Lulu, I do.
- Mm-hmm.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.327
- But I got this.

04:49.427 --> 04:50.728
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:50.828 --> 04:54.331
- All right.

04:54.431 --> 04:56.093
[lips popping]
- Okay.

04:56.193 --> 04:57.695
Well, now you're
doing your sigh, so...

04:57.795 --> 05:00.097
- I just know
how tonight's gonna go.

05:00.197 --> 05:02.139
Despite my best efforts
as an earth sign,

05:02.239 --> 05:04.061
you and Connor are gonna get
into an argument.

05:04.161 --> 05:05.462
I'm gonna have
to smooth things over.

05:05.562 --> 05:06.984
Everyone's gonna thank me

05:07.084 --> 05:08.465
and say I'm the best person
in the family.

05:08.565 --> 05:10.107
And thank god for me.

05:10.207 --> 05:11.248
- Sounds like you turn out
pretty well in that.

05:11.328 --> 05:14.210
- I do.
It's just so exhausting.

05:14.811 --> 05:16.192
- I am well aware that tonight
could be

05:16.292 --> 05:17.794
an emotional minefield,

05:17.894 --> 05:20.396
but I will not
let things blow up.

05:20.496 --> 05:22.358
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:22.458 --> 05:25.221
[upbeat music]

05:25.781 --> 05:26.923
[children exclaim]

05:27.023 --> 05:29.725
- Welcome.
What up!

05:29.825 --> 05:32.408
We've got Lupe over here
on arts and crafts.

05:32.508 --> 05:34.730
We got a pizza oven,
we got karaoke,

05:34.830 --> 05:36.812
and we got a bounce house!

05:36.912 --> 05:39.134
- Dope!

05:39.234 --> 05:40.335
- Wow!

05:40.435 --> 05:42.457
So this is
quite the production.

05:42.557 --> 05:44.820
- Yeah, I know, right?
Pretty awesome, huh?

05:44.920 --> 05:46.541
- It is, isn't it?
It is.

05:46.641 --> 05:48.984
- It is awesome, yes.

05:49.084 --> 05:51.106
Although, you know,
a part of me wonders

05:51.206 --> 05:52.827
if maybe isn't
the absolute best way

05:52.927 --> 05:54.669
to handle this situation.

05:54.769 --> 05:56.431
You know, not that
you're, like, ignoring

05:56.531 --> 05:59.033
Gretchen's feelings,
but not not that either.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.155
- What are you talking about?
This is all for her.

06:01.255 --> 06:02.757
- Hey, baby.
How are we doing?

06:02.857 --> 06:04.398
- Great!
This is gonna be so much fun!

06:04.498 --> 06:06.200
- It's gonna be lit!
- Look, Sarah,

06:06.300 --> 06:09.163
I really appreciate you trying
to sprinkle your concern

06:09.263 --> 06:11.205
all over everything,
but I got this under control.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.366
- Okay.
- Okay. It's gonna be great!

06:12.466 --> 06:14.248
- Yes!

06:14.348 --> 06:15.409
- It's worse than I thought.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.251
- Whoo!
Oh-oh!

06:17.351 --> 06:19.052
This is gonna be so tight!

06:19.152 --> 06:21.455
- Uh-oh.
Here we go.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.496
Bounce house in full effect.

06:23.596 --> 06:25.739
Shamiah, you ready
to get your bounce on?

06:25.839 --> 06:27.220
- I guess.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.662
- Noice!
Very noice!

06:29.762 --> 06:32.065
Kelvin, you having
a killer time in there, bud?

06:32.165 --> 06:33.626
- I don't know; I've
only bounced, like, four times.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.348
- Ha, ha!
The Kelvinator!

06:35.448 --> 06:37.510
Get some!
What?

06:37.610 --> 06:39.031
You crazy cousins.

06:39.131 --> 06:40.192
Whoa.
Okay.

06:40.292 --> 06:41.834
Doing flips.
That's sick!

06:41.934 --> 06:44.557
But... I don't know, maybe
is that a little dangerous?

06:44.657 --> 06:46.999
Maybe make, like,
a chill "no flip" rule, huh?

06:47.099 --> 06:49.601
That'd be dope, right?
Having fun, being safe.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.043
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead
and check and see

06:51.143 --> 06:53.365
if they have an occupancy limit
on this bad boy.

06:53.465 --> 06:55.967
- Mommy, come in with us.
- No, thanks.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.329
Just got my beverage.

06:57.429 --> 06:59.971
- Come on, Aunt Marina.
- Bounce with us!

07:00.071 --> 07:03.334
kids: Marina! Marina! Marina!

07:03.434 --> 07:05.617
- Well, okay.
Just for a minute.

07:05.717 --> 07:11.182
[yelling and screaming]

07:11.282 --> 07:12.743
- Hey, guys!

07:12.843 --> 07:14.745
Should we get Tommy in here?
Should we get crazy?

07:14.845 --> 07:17.548
- Well, I don't know.
I mean, does he even want to?

07:17.648 --> 07:18.529
- I think he was saying
something

07:18.609 --> 07:19.830
about an occupancy thing.

07:19.930 --> 07:21.992
- No, come on.
Tom!

07:22.092 --> 07:23.394
Come in here.
Come on!

07:23.494 --> 07:24.715
- No, I don't--
I don't think so.

07:24.815 --> 07:26.917
- Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

07:27.017 --> 07:27.958
- No, I'm not gonna--
I don't know.

07:28.058 --> 07:29.119
Do you guys want me to?
Okay!

07:29.219 --> 07:31.561
- Yes!
- Here I go!

07:31.661 --> 07:33.563
Whoo!
- Whoa.

07:33.663 --> 07:35.445
- Hey, Kelvin!

07:35.545 --> 07:37.807
You want a bounce competition,
see who can go the highest?

07:37.907 --> 07:40.009
Whoa!
Check out T-Dog!

07:40.109 --> 07:41.851
- Easy there, T-Dog.
- Jump, jump!

07:41.951 --> 07:43.413
Miccity-Mac'll make ya...
you know that song?

07:43.513 --> 07:44.654
[popping sound]
[children screaming]

07:44.754 --> 07:46.656
- It popped!
- He popped it.

07:46.756 --> 07:48.417
- Okay, let's go.
Come on, everybody.

07:48.517 --> 07:50.379
Jump, jump, towards the exit.

07:50.479 --> 07:51.941
- No, come on.
This is even more fun!

07:52.041 --> 07:54.403
It's like "Jackass."
Do you guys remember that show?

07:57.086 --> 07:58.627
Actually, guys,
my foot's stuck.

07:58.727 --> 07:59.748
Like--ow!
Seriously.

07:59.848 --> 08:01.850
My foot's, like, really stuck.

08:02.611 --> 08:03.952
- I just don't see why anyone
would settle

08:04.052 --> 08:05.394
for human breath balloons

08:05.494 --> 08:06.475
when we have
the helium technology,

08:06.575 --> 08:07.716
you know?

08:07.816 --> 08:09.598
- Hey, Miss Gretchen.
How are you?

08:09.698 --> 08:10.759
- Good.

08:10.859 --> 08:12.641
- Aww, great.

08:12.741 --> 08:15.964
But you know how sometimes,
people say "How are you,"

08:16.064 --> 08:18.366
and it's more of a greeting,
like "How are ya,"

08:18.466 --> 08:20.168
and then, other times,
it's the real question,

08:20.268 --> 08:21.569
like, how are you?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.751
This is one of those times.
So how are you?

08:24.792 --> 08:25.733
- Good.
- Yeah?

08:25.833 --> 08:27.575
'Cause, you know, it's okay

08:27.675 --> 08:30.257
to have different feelings
or emotions

08:30.357 --> 08:32.099
with everything
that's going on right now.

08:32.199 --> 08:33.861
If you ever need
someone to talk to--

08:33.961 --> 08:37.064
- [helium voice] Hi, Gretchen.
Hi!

08:37.164 --> 08:39.186
- Aunt Sarah, you do it.
- Aunt Sarah, you do it!

08:39.286 --> 08:43.510
- Aunt Sarah will do it.
Okay.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.712
[helium voice] Okay.
Now my voice is high too.

08:45.812 --> 08:47.314
Okay.
That's fun.

08:47.414 --> 08:49.035
Now, Gretchen,

08:49.135 --> 08:51.478
I don't want you to feel
that your feelings need

08:51.578 --> 08:55.161
to keep locked inside...

08:55.261 --> 08:57.003
I know what you're doing.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.085
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:59.185 --> 09:01.187
- Gimme, gimme, gimme.

09:03.469 --> 09:07.413
Luke, I am your father.

09:07.513 --> 09:10.616
- Dustin! Dustin! Dustin!

09:10.716 --> 09:13.098
[yelling and cheering]

09:13.198 --> 09:14.700
- Even the pizza guy is cool.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.902
- Look, you don't want to have
to tell kids you're fun.

09:17.002 --> 09:19.624
They sense the desperation,
you're dead in the water.

09:19.724 --> 09:21.666
You want to let them
realize it on their own.

09:21.766 --> 09:23.628
- Is this, like,
suddenly the fun expert?

09:23.728 --> 09:25.310
- The children
have spoken, Tom.

09:25.410 --> 09:26.991
- Okay.
- You want to toss some dough?

09:27.091 --> 09:28.393
- Oh, uh...

09:28.493 --> 09:30.114
Yeah, I guess
I could give it a shot.

09:30.214 --> 09:31.956
- Whoo!
- Oh, okay.

09:32.056 --> 09:33.598
- Whoa!
- Oh!

09:33.698 --> 09:34.959
Hey.
- Whoa!

09:35.059 --> 09:37.441
- Oh, look at that.
He's a natural.

09:37.541 --> 09:40.484
Oh, look out, Dustin.
He's gonna take your job.

09:40.584 --> 09:42.166
- Whoa.

09:42.266 --> 09:43.687
D'oh!

09:43.787 --> 09:45.609
Get it?
Cause like Homer Simpson,

09:45.709 --> 09:47.951
but also it's like dough.

09:49.072 --> 09:50.934
- That's just a waste of food.

09:51.034 --> 09:52.456
There are so many people
in the world

09:52.556 --> 09:53.657
who are food insecure.

09:53.757 --> 09:54.778
- Right.

09:54.878 --> 09:56.379
- Yeah, it's not
really that funny

09:56.479 --> 09:57.701
when you think about it, Daddy.

09:57.801 --> 10:00.183
- Absolutely.
Yeah, that's not funny at all.

10:00.283 --> 10:02.745
- Who wants cookie dough pizza
with candy toppings?

10:02.845 --> 10:04.868
[yelling and screaming]

10:04.968 --> 10:06.969
- You know what, Dustin?
We get it, okay?

10:08.971 --> 10:12.014
- I'm down to get
my arts and crafts on.

10:13.095 --> 10:14.997
You having
an awesome time, kiddo?

10:15.097 --> 10:16.599
- Hey, here's an idea.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.440
What if everybody draws
the same thing?

10:18.540 --> 10:20.442
- Yeah, I'd rather
just freestyle.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.605
- No, no, wait, it'll be good.
Like, what if everybody draws,

10:23.705 --> 10:25.968
I don't know, say,
family portraits, huh?

10:26.068 --> 10:27.889
That's fun, right?

10:27.989 --> 10:30.052
And then, if you want
to express whatever emotion

10:30.152 --> 10:31.253
you're feeling
through your artwork,

10:31.353 --> 10:32.614
then I say go for it.

10:32.714 --> 10:34.816
- Or if you want to draw
something else,

10:34.916 --> 10:40.221
like spaceships or animals
or carrots, that would be fine,

10:40.321 --> 10:42.624
because it doesn't have to be
related to family stuff.

10:42.724 --> 10:44.505
- Or we just stick
to the original idea

10:44.605 --> 10:45.867
of families and feelings.

10:45.967 --> 10:47.428
- Lulu.
- Lulu.

10:47.528 --> 10:49.670
[tense music]

10:49.770 --> 10:51.072
- So are we doing families,

10:51.172 --> 10:53.154
or could I draw,
like, a bunch of ninjas?

10:53.254 --> 10:55.556
- Families.
Everybody do families...

10:55.656 --> 10:57.718
not a family of ninjas.

10:57.818 --> 10:59.279
Nope.

10:59.379 --> 11:01.842
These are so great, guys.

11:01.942 --> 11:04.404
Thank you.
Thank you.

11:04.504 --> 11:06.967
Kelvin, I see you drew me as
the pushy boss of the family.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.030
Love it.
Excited to see yours, Gretchen.

11:11.631 --> 11:13.613
Thank you.

11:13.713 --> 11:15.815
Huh?
Who are...who are these people?

11:15.915 --> 11:17.617
- It's me and my mom
and my dad.

11:17.717 --> 11:19.819
Wait.
Does a family portrait

11:19.919 --> 11:21.140
not mean a portrait
of a family?

11:21.240 --> 11:22.742
- No, no, it does.

11:22.842 --> 11:26.265
And this is beautiful,
but is this how you...

11:26.365 --> 11:29.268
how you see your family,
all shiny and happy?

11:29.368 --> 11:32.031
Is that how you're really
feeling deep inside?

11:32.131 --> 11:34.793
- Hey, Gretchen, why don't you
go check on what Lupe's making?

11:34.893 --> 11:36.975
All this drawing
made me hungry.

11:39.418 --> 11:40.999
- You're trying to
psychoanalyze her, aren't you?

11:41.099 --> 11:42.881
- No.

11:42.981 --> 11:44.242
Psychoanalysis is actually

11:44.342 --> 11:45.443
a very specific form
of therapy,

11:45.543 --> 11:47.205
and I employ
a more humanistic form.

11:47.305 --> 11:49.247
- Sarah, I just want today
to be super fun for Gretchen.

11:49.347 --> 11:50.849
- That's the problem.

11:50.949 --> 11:52.690
You're not allowing her
to express her true feelings.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.212
- Oh, and you know
what those are?

11:54.312 --> 11:55.813
- No, but I want Gretchen
to feel comfortable enough

11:55.913 --> 11:57.535
to talk about them
if she wants to.

11:57.635 --> 11:58.976
- Talk about what?

11:59.076 --> 12:00.458
- Nothing.

12:00.558 --> 12:04.261
Aunt Sarah and I
just want you to know

12:04.361 --> 12:06.744
that it's okay to express

12:06.844 --> 12:09.707
whatever you might be feeling
about your mom and I.

12:09.807 --> 12:11.228
- Like what?

12:11.328 --> 12:12.950
- Well, it's different
for everybody, sweetie.

12:13.050 --> 12:15.672
You know, some kids--
they blame themselves,

12:15.772 --> 12:17.674
and then other kids,
they find that it's--

12:17.774 --> 12:19.476
- Wait!
The divorce is my fault?

12:19.576 --> 12:21.077
- Oh, no!
- No. No.

12:21.177 --> 12:23.760
What Aunt Sarah means to say
is that it's not your fault.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.321
- Not your fault.

12:25.421 --> 12:27.043
- But what Aunt Sarah
probably should have said

12:27.143 --> 12:29.225
is just nothing at all.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.569
You know what this moment
calls for?

12:33.669 --> 12:35.771
A Jell-O fight.

12:35.871 --> 12:37.013
- Connor?
- Yeah!

12:37.113 --> 12:38.494
- Connor, no!

12:38.594 --> 12:40.176
Do not throw that!
Connor!

12:40.276 --> 12:41.657
Do not throw that at me!
Connor!

12:41.757 --> 12:43.759
Oh, my God!

12:47.162 --> 12:48.944
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:49.044 --> 12:51.546
Gretchen seems to be okay.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.148
Her and Connor
had some floor Jell-OR,

12:53.248 --> 12:55.250
and now they're
setting up karaoke.

12:56.251 --> 12:59.674
- You were right, as always.

12:59.774 --> 13:03.558
- Lulu...

13:03.658 --> 13:05.660
of course I was.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.281
- I know that
I should have waited

13:07.381 --> 13:09.844
to reach out to Gretchen.
I just...

13:09.944 --> 13:11.285
I wanted to show myself

13:11.385 --> 13:14.368
that I could still do this,
you know, help kids,

13:14.468 --> 13:16.450
but maybe that's why
I got laid off.

13:16.550 --> 13:18.692
- Hey, no.
You were definitely right

13:18.792 --> 13:20.054
about Gretchen needing help.

13:20.154 --> 13:21.615
I mean, look
at this family portrait.

13:21.715 --> 13:25.058
It's all thunder clouds
and scared, sad faces.

13:25.158 --> 13:27.541
- Wait.
That's not Gretchen's drawing.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.862
That's Connor's.

13:28.962 --> 13:30.624
Oh, my God, do you know
what this means?

13:30.724 --> 13:32.425
- That he has the fine motor
skills of an eight-year-old?

13:32.525 --> 13:33.787
- No.
I mean, yes,

13:33.887 --> 13:35.468
this looks like he drew it
with his feet,

13:35.568 --> 13:38.691
but it was Connor.
That's why he got us all here.

13:39.212 --> 13:41.034
He's the one
who's crying out for help.

13:41.134 --> 13:44.397
- Who's ready for karaoke?
What! What!

13:44.497 --> 13:45.718
- Did somebody said karaoke--
[yells]

13:45.818 --> 13:47.820
- Be careful
with the gelatin.

13:51.143 --> 13:53.165
- So big deal,
you're not the fun uncle.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.267
You're un-fun-uncle-able.

13:55.948 --> 13:57.289
- Look, when it was just
fun Connor,

13:57.389 --> 13:59.852
I mean, I was jealous,
but, I mean, I got it.

13:59.952 --> 14:02.014
He's sort of a big kid himself.

14:02.114 --> 14:03.615
- Like he still pronounces it
"libary"

14:03.715 --> 14:04.976
and can't swallow pills.

14:05.076 --> 14:06.218
- Yeah, but now I realize
it's something

14:06.318 --> 14:09.160
you all have
that I'm missing.

14:09.801 --> 14:12.183
- I think you're fun.

14:12.283 --> 14:13.665
- Eh.
- Okay.

14:13.765 --> 14:14.906
So Connor's the funcle,

14:15.006 --> 14:16.067
but you know what you are?

14:16.167 --> 14:18.790
You're the sensible uncle.

14:18.890 --> 14:20.711
Remember how you taught Shamiah
how to use a water pick?

14:20.811 --> 14:22.273
Or you stopped Kelvin
from eating

14:22.373 --> 14:24.155
those mushrooms he found
in the yard?

14:24.255 --> 14:25.716
- Gretchen did stop
wandering off

14:25.816 --> 14:27.758
when I showed her
those kidnapping statistics.

14:27.858 --> 14:30.040
- There you go,
the sensible uncle.

First, Tom starts singing

one of his songs
to murder a drifter to,

16:34.219 --> 16:36.641
and now here comes Sarah
with her "let's talk" face.

16:36.741 --> 16:38.803
- This is just my face.
- And you always want to talk.

16:38.903 --> 16:40.124
- Okay.

16:40.224 --> 16:41.446
I know that you're upset
with me right now,

but I also know
that you're just upset.

16:43.708 --> 16:46.570
This whole epic sleepover--
it wasn't just to distract

16:46.670 --> 16:48.412
Gretchen, was it?

16:48.512 --> 16:50.734
- Sarah, no offense,
but you're a kid's therapist.

16:50.834 --> 16:52.836
Okay?
I'm a grown man.

16:59.202 --> 17:02.786
Thank you, Lupe,
for this unexpected treat.

17:02.886 --> 17:04.347
Sorry, Sarah,
but I probably shouldn't talk

17:04.447 --> 17:05.509

You've said enough,

17:07.330 --> 17:10.834

he sings and smiles

17:12.695 --> 17:13.696
and pretends
that everything's okay.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.122

to actually deal with it.

17:39.721 --> 17:41.503
You know, I kept thinking
maybe there's a chance,

17:41.603 --> 17:43.945
but last night, she told me
she is already seeing

17:44.045 --> 17:47.248
someone else,
some guy named Alex.

17:47.889 --> 17:49.510
And he sounds like
a total douche, right?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.472
- Yes, he does.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.995
I'm sorry, Connor.

it's really over.

Alec...Alex...Alec?

They'll be here at eight.

to worry about me too.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.626

18:26.726 --> 18:28.548
but it's okay
to open up to her.

18:28.648 --> 18:30.650
It might actually help.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.511
- I know I like
to make fun of you

18:32.611 --> 18:35.574
for trying to get in our heads,
but thank you.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.678
Wanna pull up a spoon?

18:39.778 --> 18:41.640

- Pull up a spoon.

- No.
No, it's just that

18:43.021 --> 18:44.883
Haagen-Dazs isn't
a real Danish word,

18:44.983 --> 18:46.245
so even
though it's Eurocentric,

18:46.345 --> 18:48.006
it's technically still
cultural appropriation.

18:48.106 --> 18:49.287
- Pull up a spoon.
- Fine. Yeah, sure.

18:49.387 --> 18:51.490
I'll do it.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.591
I didn't ruin the moment,
did I?

18:54.232 --> 18:59.017
- So yeah, I'm sad,

18:59.117 --> 19:01.259
a little scared.

19:01.359 --> 19:02.860
How about you?

19:02.960 --> 19:06.264
- Yeah, I was kind of
pretending to be happy

19:06.364 --> 19:08.366
because I didn't want
to make you feel bad.

19:10.448 --> 19:12.229
- Well, from now on, we should
be honest with each other

19:12.329 --> 19:13.430
about how we're feeling, okay?

19:13.530 --> 19:15.272
- Okay.

have some fun today?

19:28.705 --> 19:30.247
I can't get out, seriously!"

- "Oh, my foot's stuck.
Help! Help!"

19:32.749 --> 19:35.331
- He couldn't get his foot out.
That was hilarious.

19:35.431 --> 19:37.413
- Well, I'm glad they were able
to bond over what was

19:37.513 --> 19:39.535
admittedly
a very dicey situation.

19:39.635 --> 19:42.098
- We're lucky to have you, Tom,
our little killjoy.

19:42.198 --> 19:43.539
- Okay.
Actually, I think we're going

19:43.639 --> 19:45.801
with the word sensible,
but thank you.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.945

to open up

19:50.045 --> 19:52.668
after you were so worried
about your ability to help.

19:52.768 --> 19:55.350
Guess you didn't need me to
smooth things over after all.

19:56.732 --> 19:58.153
- A little.
