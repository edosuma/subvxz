13:06.219 --> 13:08.086
Mattias was here it was for
a book of Cold War secrets.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.954
He was never
after Hetty.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.823
So why is he now?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.825
It doesn't matter why he's here.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.294
Just that we find him.

13:17.396 --> 13:19.464
(door opens)

13:21.167 --> 13:23.168
THOMAS:
We all make important decisions

13:23.170 --> 13:25.436
that affect the lives of others.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.105
We use protocol

13:27.107 --> 13:29.240
because history has taught us

13:29.242 --> 13:32.410
which decisions protect
the most lives.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.413
in the middle of a war,
Mr. Thomas,

13:35.415 --> 13:39.017
history is being made
in the present moment,

13:39.019 --> 13:42.821
and protocol
can seem a little outdated.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.490
Mm. So you believe that
you have the authority

13:45.492 --> 13:47.458
(phone buzzing)
to change protocol
whenever you see fit?

13:55.401 --> 13:57.435
What would you do

13:57.437 --> 14:01.206
if a family member of yours
was kidnapped, Mr. Thomas?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.541
Is that a threat, Ms. Lange?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.410
It's hyperbole.

14:05.412 --> 14:09.480
I'm asking you to humor me
for the sake of argument.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.349
W...

14:11.351 --> 14:13.551
I don't see the humor
in the question.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.587
Neither do I.

14:15.589 --> 14:19.324
How far would you go

14:19.326 --> 14:22.260
if the life of a family member
was threatened?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.595
I would use

14:23.597 --> 14:25.597
every resource available to me,

14:25.599 --> 14:27.999
within the law,

14:28.001 --> 14:30.201
to save them.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.104
But this case
is not about my family.

14:33.106 --> 14:36.941
But it is about mine.

14:36.943 --> 14:40.445
And therein perhaps
lies the problem.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.314
Because the agents
and the support personnel

14:43.316 --> 14:46.885
that you oversee
are not your family.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.287
They are, in fact, employees
of the U.S. government.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.456
They are human assets.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.657
They...
Ms. Lange, is there

14:52.659 --> 14:54.425
a problem?

14:54.427 --> 14:56.494
Where the hell
do you think you're going?!

14:56.496 --> 14:58.663
What is she doing?

14:58.665 --> 15:00.899
What is she doing now?!

15:00.901 --> 15:03.067
One moment, please.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.473
Hetty, what are you doing?

15:08.475 --> 15:10.475
I'm going home.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.910
You can't.

15:11.912 --> 15:15.413
I need to get back
to Los Angeles.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.149
They won't let you go anywhere.

15:19.451 --> 15:20.985
Horsefeathers.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.487
(elevator bell dings)

15:25.057 --> 15:28.459
Enjoy my lunch
when it arrives, Mr. Ogilvie.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.632

15:34.634 --> 15:36.301
Come on, how tough
could it be

15:36.303 --> 15:39.304
to locate one little woman
in a heavily secured building?

15:39.306 --> 15:42.140
Lock the place down.
Nobody enters, nobody leaves

15:42.142 --> 15:44.008
until we find her.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.477

15:46.479 --> 15:47.545
Fire alarm.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.481
(groans)
She did this.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.583
She's relentless.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.055
(groans)

16:03.529 --> 16:08.266
Oh, of all the mornings
I forgot to stretch.

doing. I'm flushing him out.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.632
Flushing him out.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.168
Even if it creates a
mob of vigilantes?

18:24.170 --> 18:25.770
I want to get
this guy, too.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.339
I just don't want to set
the city on fire to do it.

18:37.816 --> 18:40.218
I mean,
I knew this day would come.

18:40.220 --> 18:44.322

You can prepare

18:50.864 --> 18:53.197
That's the strangest part.
It's like...

18:53.199 --> 18:54.866
It's not even a feeling.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.734
It's like
there was a feeling there

18:56.736 --> 18:59.203
and now it's just... gone.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.771
That's your
subconscious doing

19:00.773 --> 19:02.306
its best to suppress it.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.642
Killing someone goes
against every moral fiber

19:04.644 --> 19:06.644
ingrained in
you since birth.
Right.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.379
And I know that here.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.914
He was a cold-blooded killer,

19:09.916 --> 19:12.884
and it was me or him, but...

19:14.153 --> 19:17.288
I just can't stop thinking
about the people

19:17.290 --> 19:20.491
who brought him
into this world and...
Nell,

19:20.493 --> 19:23.194
you're the victim
of a post-shooting trauma.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.930
You know, that man forced you
to shoot him.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.299
He did this to you.

19:29.701 --> 19:33.704
Look, I just think if I found
myself in a similar situation,

19:33.706 --> 19:37.208
I wouldn't choose
to feel this way again.

19:38.810 --> 19:42.213
If there's even an
ounce of truth to that,

19:42.215 --> 19:44.215
you shouldn't go
back to the field.

your own life

19:52.425 --> 19:54.425
Nothing. Oh!

19:54.427 --> 19:56.494

I had to.

20:47.914 --> 20:48.913
She's coming here.

You played her into his hand.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.716
Why the hell would you do that?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.884
She needed to know

his credit card

It was a trap.

Mattias killed that guy

What's the word

of Staff's office

24:15.054 --> 24:17.154

Not now. Wallace and her team

We were taking sniper fire.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.545
We followed protocol.

he's going off the reservation.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.989
Hetty is the closest thing
he has to family,

24:51.991 --> 24:54.692
so whatever cool he has
is about to evaporate.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.627
Our operations
are already

24:56.629 --> 25:01.031
under the microscope, so if you
can't keep him under control,

25:01.033 --> 25:03.267
I'm gonna have
to pull him off this.

25:03.269 --> 25:06.871
You try it,
and he<i> will</i> go rogue,

25:06.873 --> 25:09.507
and I'll join him.

25:11.643 --> 25:14.044
Consider yourselves warned.

25:19.284 --> 25:20.818
(door opens)

25:20.820 --> 25:23.988
Don't you two have something
better to do?

25:23.990 --> 25:25.189
(door closes)

25:25.191 --> 25:27.024
CALLEN:
<i>You have to have something.</i>

25:27.026 --> 25:29.927
The guy was firing a rifle
on a rooftop in broad daylight.

25:29.929 --> 25:33.531
Most surveillance cameras
are pointed down, not up.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.566
And no one reported
seeing Mattias?

25:35.568 --> 25:37.034
No. Sorry.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.136
Who's the dead guy?

25:39.138 --> 25:41.605
Uh, his name is
Demitri Beriliev.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.807
He's here on a student visa.

25:43.809 --> 25:46.043
He's Russian.

25:50.181 --> 25:52.316
Look, I'm sorry

25:52.318 --> 25:54.051
we got off on the wrong foot.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.787
I was sent here
with a mission,

25:56.789 --> 25:58.622
just like you.
Oh, no, no, no.

25:58.624 --> 26:01.759
I chase bad guys, not good guys.

26:01.761 --> 26:05.062
Well, maybe
when all of this is over,

26:05.064 --> 26:06.964
I can buy you a drink...

26:06.966 --> 26:10.000
as a peace offering.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.336
I'm married.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.939
Oh.

26:16.641 --> 26:18.776
That's not in your record.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.645
Yeah, well, a lot of things
that aren't in my record,

26:21.647 --> 26:24.081
or Callen's
or Hetty's or any of us.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.350
Sorry. I...

26:26.352 --> 26:30.087
None of your other, uh,
team members were married.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.656
I guess I just assumed...

26:32.658 --> 26:35.659
Yeah.

26:35.661 --> 26:37.895
I mean, it must be hard...

26:37.897 --> 26:40.664
in your line of work.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.833
It can be hard
in any line of work.

26:44.669 --> 26:47.137
Anything worthwhile
is worth the effort, right?

26:47.139 --> 26:49.773
My wife used
to be an operator.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.710
She understands
better than most.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.378
Lucky.

26:54.380 --> 26:57.615
Oh, yes, I am.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.617
(phone line ringing)

26:59.619 --> 27:01.785
Agent Callen.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.756
What was that all about?

27:05.758 --> 27:07.291
No idea.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.927
Well, what she ask you?

27:09.929 --> 27:12.129
I don't know.

27:14.065 --> 27:16.133
It was nothing.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.202
Okay.

27:21.706 --> 27:23.741
(phone line ringing)

27:23.743 --> 27:25.409
So stop looking at me.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.811
I'm not looking at you.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.680
Now, I'm looking at you
'cause you're looking at me.

27:29.682 --> 27:30.648
Why are you acting so weird?

27:30.650 --> 27:31.949
I'm not acting weird.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.652
You're acting weird.
Wow.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.787
I did not see that coming.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.989
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You know exactly

27:38.991 --> 27:40.124
what I'm talking about.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.759
Uh, no, I don't.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.761
This is how you act
when you get hit on.

27:43.763 --> 27:45.996
You obviously made
an impression on her.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.698
I'm sure
it probably had something

27:47.700 --> 27:48.832
to do with your driving.

27:51.436 --> 27:53.804
We need to pick up Arkady.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.840
Why?
'Cause he's not
answering my calls,

27:56.842 --> 27:58.075
and because the guy

27:58.077 --> 28:00.077
that was helping Mattias
is a Russian national.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.346
You don't think
Arkady has anything

28:02.348 --> 28:03.847
to do with this, do you?

28:03.849 --> 28:06.417
For his sake, I hope not.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.854
So, are you saying
Nell may be gun-shy?

28:12.691 --> 28:15.259
Look, Nell is great
at what she does.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.760
Am I convinced she's ready

28:16.762 --> 28:18.462
for the next step
in undercover work?

28:18.464 --> 28:20.364
That remains to be seen.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.333
Well, she's been well-trained,
and she has the skills.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.968
Yes, but it's the mindset.

28:24.970 --> 28:27.004
That's something
you cannot teach.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.006
It can be honed and improved,

28:29.008 --> 28:32.376
but being able to live
with killing another human

28:32.378 --> 28:35.279
is something
inherent.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.382
It's a deeper part
of the human condition.

28:38.384 --> 28:42.186
Are you talking about the soul?

28:42.188 --> 28:45.789
If that's what
you want to call it.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.027
I will never forget
the first person I had to kill,

28:50.029 --> 28:52.096
but it never haunted me.

28:53.031 --> 28:56.100
What does that say
about my soul?

28:56.102 --> 28:58.869
Look, this is all very new
to Nell.

28:58.871 --> 29:02.106
I'll have a better understanding
of her abilities

29:02.108 --> 29:03.874
once it settles in.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.776
Well, we don't have time
for it to settle in.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.811
We need all the help
we can get right now.

29:07.813 --> 29:09.813
Which is why I'll stick around

29:09.815 --> 29:11.782
until the situation is resolved.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.951
You guys could use
me in the field.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.486
Good.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.293
Not answering your phone?

29:23.295 --> 29:25.462
I've been busy.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.965
How did you find me?

29:27.967 --> 29:30.534
Your ex-wife's sister.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.869
Which one?

29:31.871 --> 29:33.403
Svetlana.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.139
Aah, she always talked too much.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.874
Must be genetic.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.008
CALLEN:
Arkady,

29:38.010 --> 29:39.409
what are you doing here?

29:39.411 --> 29:41.478
My doctor told me to join gym.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.880
SAM:
Yeah?

29:42.882 --> 29:45.516
Probably expected you
to work out.

29:45.518 --> 29:47.351
I'm between sets.

29:47.353 --> 29:48.819
CALLEN:
Our old German friend

29:48.821 --> 29:50.320
Mattias is
back in town.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.156
He's already tried
to kill us... twice,

29:52.158 --> 29:54.191
as a matter of fact.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.059
Once using a Russian decoy
as bait.

29:56.061 --> 29:59.429
or are you too busy working
on your figure?

30:00.398 --> 30:04.334
I don't know anything about it.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.036
He tried
to kidnap Hetty.

30:11.042 --> 30:12.876
What?

30:15.113 --> 30:17.147
In case you haven't noticed,

30:17.149 --> 30:20.050
Cold War is back,
only it's not so cold lately.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.586
And for someone like
your Hetty who has a head

30:22.588 --> 30:27.024
full of secrets they'd love
to get their hands on,

30:27.026 --> 30:29.293
this is just the beginning.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.928
What does that mean?

30:30.930 --> 30:34.364
I mean, it will get worse
before it gets better,

30:34.366 --> 30:37.367
and your Hetty

30:37.369 --> 30:38.869
won't be the
only target.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.237
Who else will they go after?

30:40.239 --> 30:42.306
Use your imagination.
CALLEN:
We're not

30:42.308 --> 30:44.908
playing around, Arkady.
Who else will they go after?

30:44.910 --> 30:46.510
I don't know!

30:46.512 --> 30:48.579
And to be honest, I don't care.

30:49.948 --> 30:52.015
I've got my own problems.

30:53.885 --> 30:57.020
We will be your problem if you
don't start to level with us.

30:58.223 --> 31:00.858
You don't scare me...

31:00.860 --> 31:03.227
but they do,

31:03.229 --> 31:06.930
because I am one of the people
they will come after.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.472
Don't strain yourself.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.645
I can't find a connection

31:21.647 --> 31:23.247
between Mattias and
the dead Russian.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.616
So where does
a German spy hide out?

31:25.618 --> 31:27.017
Wiener schnitzel?

31:27.019 --> 31:28.652
You're a Wiener schnitzel.
That's true.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.220
I used to have
this Austrian girlfriend

31:30.222 --> 31:31.588
who used to call me her...

31:31.590 --> 31:34.591
Cocktail wiener?
Sausage king.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.960
Oh, I see
that nothing has changed here.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.196
Oh!
Nate! Hey.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.598
What's up, brother?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.100
What are you doing here?

31:43.102 --> 31:44.968
Well, Granger wanted me here
for Nell,

31:44.970 --> 31:46.904
and I wanted
to be here for Hetty.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.038
ERIC:
Got him.
What?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.139
Got him.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.207
SALAZAR:
Check it out.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.042
We got the guy
you're looking for.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.977
Now where's our money?

31:53.979 --> 31:56.113
Alert Callen and Sam.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.155
(phone buzzing)

32:07.692 --> 32:09.026
Hello?

32:09.028 --> 32:12.362
I need a sitrep, Ms. Jones.

32:12.364 --> 32:13.964
Hetty? Where are you?

32:13.966 --> 32:16.700
Somewhere over Kansas.

32:16.702 --> 32:20.103
Where is Mattias Draeger?

32:20.105 --> 32:23.006
I don't know.

32:23.008 --> 32:27.110
Well, I don't want anyone
going after him until my return.

32:27.112 --> 32:30.013
It's probably too late.

32:30.015 --> 32:31.415
I'm sure Callen and the others

32:31.417 --> 32:33.317
are already out there
looking for him.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.285
You don't know?

32:35.287 --> 32:37.654
No, I'm not at work.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.057
I am... I'm home.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.291
Why?

32:41.293 --> 32:42.693
Are you ill?

32:42.695 --> 32:46.096
I'm not.

32:46.098 --> 32:49.499
Nell, what's going on?

32:51.602 --> 32:54.071
Hetty, I shot someone.

32:54.073 --> 32:57.140
Oh, I see.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.710
And he died.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.745
Was it self-defense?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.547
Yes.

33:03.549 --> 33:06.083
But it all happened so fast,

33:06.085 --> 33:07.384
and now I'm not...

33:07.386 --> 33:10.120
I know, Nell. I know.

33:10.122 --> 33:13.757
But I need you to focus.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.759
Chin up.

33:15.761 --> 33:19.096
I'm on my way back
to Los Angeles

33:19.098 --> 33:22.432
and I'm going to need
to hit the ground running.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.533
Understood?

33:23.535 --> 33:24.601
Yes, ma'am.

33:24.603 --> 33:25.669
Good girl.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.471
Do you have a pen?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.239
Go ahead.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.241
I'll going to need a chopper

33:31.243 --> 33:34.144
from Pendleton
to Santa Monica airport

33:34.146 --> 33:36.513
and a car there waiting

33:36.515 --> 33:38.081
with some of my weapons.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.483
Got it.

33:42.553 --> 33:45.022
Slow down, G.
We should wait for backup.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.623
I'm not risking
this guy getting away.

33:46.625 --> 33:47.724
Hey.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.360
(muffled music playing)

33:50.362 --> 33:51.528
Yo, Salazar.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.530
Maybe they moved him.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.299
(grunts)
Hey.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.602
Last time was a trap.
I know that.

33:58.604 --> 34:01.705
We bring him in alive.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.440
Promise me.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.575
I'm done making promises.

34:05.577 --> 34:06.810
G, don't...

34:06.812 --> 34:09.079
Salazar?
Federal agents.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.784
We got bodies.

34:27.131 --> 34:28.698
Salazar.

34:31.669 --> 34:33.670
Grenade!

34:33.672 --> 34:35.605
(explosion)

34:35.607 --> 34:39.509
(car alarms wailing,
horns honking)

35:07.405 --> 35:09.573
DEEKS:
You guys okay?

35:09.575 --> 35:11.408
Better than Salazar's gang.

35:11.410 --> 35:14.578
These guys didn't even
put up a struggle.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.580
I think Mattias
used them.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.415
He must have found out
about G's reward.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.816
Used it against us
to lure us out.

35:19.818 --> 35:22.486
So where is he? And why
wasn't he waiting to pick us off

35:22.488 --> 35:24.521
when we came out? Why
isn't he shooting at us

35:24.523 --> 35:27.724
right now? I mean... Mattias
is old school, just like Hetty.

35:27.726 --> 35:30.427
And they're always
playing a long game.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.429
Okay, so what's the long game?

35:32.431 --> 35:34.664
Hetty.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.299
Well, that game's
gonna get a lot easier

35:36.301 --> 35:38.235
when Hetty shows up.
(phone rings)

35:38.669 --> 35:40.170
What do you got, Eric?

35:40.172 --> 35:41.705
Mattias isn't dead.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.373
Yeah, we figured that part out.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.208
He was just in the boatshed.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.810
What?

35:46.812 --> 35:49.546
The silent alarm went off.
It was Mattias.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.648
Granger and Nate
are there now, but

35:51.650 --> 35:53.683
Mattias is gone.
The place is clear.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.285
We'll meet 'em there.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.420
How the hell did he know
about the boatshed?

35:57.422 --> 36:00.223
Because he's good.
Scary good.

36:00.225 --> 36:01.491
If Mattias
found the boatshed,

36:01.493 --> 36:02.926
why didn't he just
try and ambush us?

36:02.928 --> 36:04.728
Why didn't he
set a trap?
He used

36:04.730 --> 36:07.197
Ryan Greene to lure us into
the kill box the same way

36:07.199 --> 36:08.598
he feigned his own capture
for your ransom.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.333
So what the hell was
the appearance at the boatshed

36:10.335 --> 36:12.302
all about? If he wanted
to lure us there,

36:12.304 --> 36:14.538
why didn't Nate or Granger
find anything?

36:14.540 --> 36:17.774
Maybe they weren't looking
in the right place.

36:19.477 --> 36:20.944
That son of a bitch.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.379
What?

36:22.381 --> 36:23.947
What?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.749
What are
you doing?

36:31.956 --> 36:33.657
The beach.

36:33.659 --> 36:36.493
He lured us there.
Probably watched our arrival.

36:36.495 --> 36:39.563
Why use a tracking device if
you were planning on killing us?

36:39.565 --> 36:41.765
Backup plan.

36:41.767 --> 36:45.268
Or maybe he wasn't planning
on killing all of us.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.404
He's gonna keep one of us
alive to lead him back...

36:47.406 --> 36:48.538
To Hetty.

36:50.308 --> 36:52.509
I need these two
squad cars moved.
(line ringing)

36:52.511 --> 36:53.910
Callen?
Eric,

36:53.912 --> 36:55.879
(engines starting)
we think Ops may
be compromised.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.515
Whoa, what?

36:58.517 --> 36:59.816
Mattias tagged our cars
at the beach, he tracked 'em

36:59.818 --> 37:00.951
back to the boatshed,
which means

37:00.953 --> 37:02.519
he's probably on his way to Ops.

37:02.521 --> 37:03.853
Like,<i> Ops</i> Ops?

37:03.855 --> 37:05.222
SAM:
Eric, you can handle this.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.489
Just get everyone
out of there,

37:06.491 --> 37:07.924
find Hetty
and divert her.

37:07.926 --> 37:08.925
Where?

37:08.927 --> 37:11.428
Anywhere but Ops.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.830
(exhales)
Oh, boy.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.545
ERIC:
<i>Guys, Hetty's already</i>
<i>in the building.</i>

37:28.547 --> 37:30.280
CALLEN:
<i>Then get her out of there.</i>

37:43.828 --> 37:46.730
Mattias, my old...

37:46.732 --> 37:49.833
whatever the hell you are.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.969
Good to see you again,
Henrietta.

37:56.807 --> 37:58.008
It's been a while.

38:01.479 --> 38:04.814
He's here. Mattias is here,
with Hetty, in her office.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.916
How did you get in here?

38:06.918 --> 38:09.519
Let's just say...

38:09.521 --> 38:12.455
Dennis won't be returning
from lunch.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.858
Am I missing something

38:14.860 --> 38:16.860
or have you lost your mind?

38:16.862 --> 38:18.862
Because I can't

38:18.864 --> 38:21.364
figure out the logic

38:21.366 --> 38:22.866
in all of this.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.302
Longevity.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.038
Be honest, did you ever
think either one of us

38:28.040 --> 38:29.939
would live this long?

38:30.941 --> 38:32.709
You haven't planned

38:32.711 --> 38:35.412
for your retirement, have you?

38:35.414 --> 38:37.981
I thought my retirement
would be a bullet.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.983
Well, hopefully
it still will be.

38:39.985 --> 38:43.320
What can I say?
You're my nest egg.

38:43.322 --> 38:45.922
You are crazier than I am

38:45.924 --> 38:48.625
if you think you're
going to get out of here alive.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.893
Yes, well,

38:49.895 --> 38:51.895
let's talk all about that
on our flight

38:51.897 --> 38:54.097
back to Moscow. Shall we?

38:56.867 --> 38:58.601
Shoot me...

38:58.603 --> 39:00.837
you won't
get five feet

39:00.839 --> 39:03.840
without being killed.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.842
It's over, Mattias.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.611
I'm not budging
from this chair.

39:08.613 --> 39:12.048
I think you will...

39:12.050 --> 39:14.617
if I give you this.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.686
I seem to recall
you having

39:16.688 --> 39:19.122
a very bad experience
with this once.

39:19.124 --> 39:23.460
You are an evil
son of a bitch.

39:23.462 --> 39:27.030
We are what they made us.
Let's go.

39:30.968 --> 39:32.469
WALLACE:
Excuse me,

39:32.471 --> 39:35.905
Ms. Lange. We haven't had
a chance to discuss the...

39:35.907 --> 39:37.540
(gasps)

39:38.709 --> 39:40.410
(grunting)

39:43.647 --> 39:45.548
Aah!

39:45.550 --> 39:46.883
(grunting)

39:46.885 --> 39:48.785
Aah!

39:48.787 --> 39:52.555
The Mattias I knew...
(Wallace grunting)

39:52.557 --> 39:54.691
would never have worn

39:54.693 --> 39:57.927
body armor.
You're getting soft.

40:01.031 --> 40:03.066
Come out, come out,

40:03.068 --> 40:06.102
you German bastard

40:06.104 --> 40:07.904
and fight
like a man.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.407
(gunshots)
(both grunt)

40:13.177 --> 40:14.711
Nell?
Hetty,

40:14.713 --> 40:16.880
what are you doing?

40:16.882 --> 40:19.048
I'm trying to call him out.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.418
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.554
Good to have you back, Nell.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.091
(grunting)

40:29.827 --> 40:31.728
Oh! Aah!

40:31.730 --> 40:32.996
Mattias!

40:32.998 --> 40:34.864
Inspector Wallace has been shot.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.567
Mattias is on the colonnade.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.607
(Wallace groaning)

40:48.846 --> 40:50.213
MATTIAS:
Both of you:

40:50.215 --> 40:52.849
throw down your weapons
and walk to me, Henrietta,

40:52.851 --> 40:54.984
or I'll kill her.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.587
Oh, bugger.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.489
All right.

41:01.091 --> 41:03.660
Hetty, don't.

41:03.662 --> 41:06.496
Do what he says.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.098
Let's get this over with.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.667
Great.

41:10.669 --> 41:11.835
(gun clatters)

41:19.009 --> 41:21.144
(Wallace groaning)

41:31.956 --> 41:33.056
That's far enough.

41:34.592 --> 41:36.125
(door opens)

41:38.229 --> 41:41.764
He's wearing a vest.
Head shots only.

41:43.801 --> 41:46.135
In the old days,

41:46.137 --> 41:48.838
someone would have
killed me by now.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.541
That's your problem, Mattias.

41:51.543 --> 41:53.877
Too much nostalgia.

41:58.816 --> 42:02.151
We both know
you don't have the balls.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.928
Aah!

42:13.831 --> 42:16.733
Sorry. Touchy trigger.

42:16.735 --> 42:17.867
(groaning)

42:21.539 --> 42:23.973
(handcuffs clicking)

42:23.975 --> 42:25.542
You good?

42:25.544 --> 42:27.977
Thanks.

42:27.979 --> 42:29.612
You okay?

42:31.081 --> 42:33.716
Guess I owe you
that drink after all.

42:33.718 --> 42:37.754
(short laugh)
Somebody owes me a whole bottle.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.723
DEEKS:
One, two, three, German.

42:40.725 --> 42:42.926
Wow, that looks like it hurts.
(grunting)

42:50.668 --> 42:52.068
Welcome back.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.270
Thank you, Mr. Callen.
