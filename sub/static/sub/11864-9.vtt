00:12.846 --> 00:15.419
Every reaper has their own style.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.226
Those touches
that make death so special.

00:18.351 --> 00:22.515
Do I need to be crossing over
or passing on or something?

00:22.647 --> 00:25.352
You ain't going nowhere until I fill my quota.

00:25.483 --> 00:28.437
Cool it. Sir, I'm gonna say this politely.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.646
I will fuck you up.

00:32.490 --> 00:36.986
- She's a strange 11-year-old.
- She's going through a difficult time.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.204
Reggie's been stealing toilet seats.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.905
You think a few photos will stop that?

00:43.043 --> 00:47.455
I think it'd be more productive
if I talked to Reggie alone today.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.498
You like the ladies, right?

00:50.258 --> 00:51.966
Bloody hell.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.088
- How are you doing?
- I don't think so.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.923
JD?

01:01.978 --> 01:05.227
JD, come! JD, come!

01:07.400 --> 01:09.856
Who's going to take care of JD?

01:13.323 --> 01:14.354
Who are you?

02:23.560 --> 02:26.810
The best memories
don't have a chance.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.979
You keep coming back to them

02:30.108 --> 02:34.485
and every time you do,
you cook them a little more.

02:34.612 --> 02:37.946
Daddy, want one of my pancakes
when they come?

02:38.074 --> 02:42.119
Yeah. George, I'll trade you a pancake
for two pieces of my bacon.

02:42.245 --> 02:46.373
It's a deal. But you could
have had a pancake for free.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.575
- Goal!
- Whoo!

02:48.710 --> 02:53.953
After a while, all you
have left is this tiny, crispy fragment.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.839
It's not like you even remember
what happened any more.

02:57.969 --> 03:01.670
It's more like it's the idea
of what happened.

03:01.806 --> 03:04.973
And Sunday mornings were the best.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.347
The ketchup?

03:13.526 --> 03:16.563
Georgia?
The ketchup, George. The ketchup.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.772
Oh. Sorry.

03:18.907 --> 03:23.403
I know it's none of my business,
but you are a very internal creature.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.324
It's none of your business,
but you act like it is.

03:26.456 --> 03:31.747
- I'm not internal.
- That's why you don't have any friends.

03:31.878 --> 03:37.217
- Roxy here is an external as they get.
- You don't know me.

03:37.342 --> 03:42.502
I know your moods - grumpy,
mean and grumpy, sleepy and grumpy.

03:42.639 --> 03:47.882
- Like the seven dwarves.
- Daisy, did you ever sleep with a dwarf?

03:48.019 --> 03:50.510
Don't be stupid. They're cartoons.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.063
I would love to see you do my job
for one day.

03:54.192 --> 03:59.020
When there's a Broadway musical
about your shoes, I will walk a mile in them.

04:00.281 --> 04:04.611
- May I have my assignment?
- It's the college. Parking's a nightmare.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.781
- I don't have a car.
- Parking's still a nightmare.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.998
- I'll come with you.
- I like to do things alone.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.744
You're trying to score
some sweet young thing.

04:14.879 --> 04:19.007
Being around all that youthful energy
might inspire me.

04:19.134 --> 04:22.337
Then you could steal a shitload of drugs.

04:23.471 --> 04:28.429
Round and round and round it goes,
where it stops, nobody knows.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.682
You know after you've been dead a while

04:31.813 --> 04:36.522
and you suspect things might be
coming back to normal in your family?

04:36.651 --> 04:39.320
OK. Maybe you don't.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.281
I think that may have happened
to my family.

04:42.407 --> 04:46.239
The weird part is that my family
never was normal before.

04:46.369 --> 04:50.284
You know that Irish setter
I had growing up? Freckles?

04:50.415 --> 04:54.993
- Yeah. Your mom showed me pictures.
- She loathed that dog.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.414
She told me that
when she was showing me pictures.

04:58.548 --> 05:03.127
One day it took a crap in one of her shoes.
That was all she wrote.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.717
Dad can't bear to put it to sleep,

05:05.847 --> 05:10.639
so he announces he's going to drive
Freckles up Mount Tam to set him free.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.390
- In the woods?
- In the woods.

05:13.521 --> 05:16.191
He should have done that with your mother.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.269
He kept them both.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.574
It only says "77th floor. RL Guggenheim."

05:28.703 --> 05:31.159
- This is a dump.
- What were you expecting?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.246
Something more collegiate.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.826
- Holy shit!
- Jeez!

05:35.960 --> 05:39.045
That was my bong, douche bag!

05:39.172 --> 05:40.832
But it's nice.

05:40.965 --> 05:44.833
I could have gone to college...
until I hit my teacher with a book.

05:44.969 --> 05:48.967
Maybe it was a globe. I can't
remember what I hit my teacher with.

05:49.099 --> 05:54.341
- When did this happen?
- Er, primary. So I was seven or eight.

05:54.479 --> 05:58.690
My mother was more excited
about me going to college than I was.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.980
"Hey! Here's a socially acceptable way
to evict my daughter."

06:03.113 --> 06:05.022
- But you didn't go.
- I went.

06:05.156 --> 06:10.233
- I just dropped out. She hated me for it.
- Your father must have shit.

06:10.370 --> 06:15.661
He didn't say much really.
We weren't really close at that point.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.200
- Why?
- I don't know.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.210
When I was a kid we were close.

06:20.338 --> 06:25.581
He used to let me drink Coke at breakfast.
I thought that was really cool.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.384
Dad, do the straw trick.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.760
That never gets old.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.563
College is two things.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.479
Forget what they put in Latin around the seal -

06:43.611 --> 06:46.897
it is not about veritas or fraternitas.

06:47.032 --> 06:51.278
College is about stress-itas
and binge-itas.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.905
Stress...

06:53.038 --> 06:54.781
binge.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.750
Anyone seen a card
with calculus equations on it?

06:57.876 --> 06:59.121
Stress...

06:59.252 --> 07:01.494
.. binge.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.085
I don't know what I was worried about.

07:04.215 --> 07:08.130
I didn't have any papers due,
I hadn't broken up with my boyfriend,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.052
I didn't feel stupid and alone.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.928
But just being near these people who did
made me wanna cry.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.347
- Drugs?
- No, thank you.

07:16.478 --> 07:20.012
Antidepressants, amoxicillin.
Everyone's taking amoxicillin.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.683
- Good for them.
- I have this theory.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.567
All this elitist college crap
is just a front for the bacteria.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.271
Bacteria creates the colleges

07:30.408 --> 07:35.035
to have the perfect place
to breed and evolve.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.034
Let's just find this guy and get outta here.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.037
"Like as the waves
make toward a pebbled shore,

07:41.169 --> 07:44.336
So do our minutes hasten to their end;

07:44.464 --> 07:47.667
Each changing place
with that which goes before..."

07:47.801 --> 07:51.004
Reading poetry
to a guy in my dorm room?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.213
This is something I'll never do.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.387
Hey, seÃ±orita!

07:55.517 --> 07:59.811
Make way for Boutrous Boutrous-Nitrous!

07:59.938 --> 08:02.939
Something else I'll never do.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.901
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.352
".. but for his scythe to know:

08:08.488 --> 08:11.524
"And yet to times in hope
my verse shall stand

08:11.658 --> 08:14.612
"Praising thy worth,
despite his cruel hand."

08:15.745 --> 08:18.912
- You get this?
- Yeah, yeah. Very moving.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.792
- Want a beer?
- No.

08:23.712 --> 08:27.544
I thought we could relax a little bit.
Fuck!

08:28.341 --> 08:30.417
Just leave the door open.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.472
Has anybody seen my pink index card?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.972
Is your name Rich Guggenheim?

08:40.102 --> 08:43.686
Fuck! Yes, I am. Thank you so much.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.480
- Big test, huh?
- Yeah. Well, no...

08:47.610 --> 08:50.777
Who cares?
The number of this girl is on here.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.575
Her name is Jenny.
Do you believe in fate?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.574
Kinda.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.869
We met by the vending machines
in the med library.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.702
They have Yoo-hoo. Whatever.

09:01.833 --> 09:06.578
She was singing that old song,
"Do You Know The Way To San Jose?"

09:06.713 --> 09:09.002
and I had Kazaaed that the night before.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.466
I said to her,
"We should just get in the car

09:12.594 --> 09:16.674
and drive to San Jose, you know...

09:16.806 --> 09:19.807
fuck all this."

09:19.934 --> 09:24.513
And she turns to me and she's
almost crying, with her Yoo-hoo and shit,

09:24.647 --> 09:30.318
and she says, "I've never been
to California. Let's do it after finals!"

09:30.445 --> 09:33.980
And she wrote her number down.
This is it.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.491
Jenny.

09:36.659 --> 09:39.660
I think we're really gonna go.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.703
You should.

09:45.835 --> 09:50.414
Jenny may get to California,
but it won't be with him.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.588
Shit!

09:53.677 --> 09:57.544
The clowns
were fucking with the laws of physics.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.507
It's OK.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.801
Watch out!

10:06.106 --> 10:07.434
Dude?

10:08.483 --> 10:09.728
Dude.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.935
I think it's time to go.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.315
She wanted that open.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.079
Stop it. Get off of me!

10:26.209 --> 10:29.874
I respect that you're saying no,
but you'll change your mind.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.496
Stop it!

10:32.632 --> 10:36.630
- I remember what I hit my teacher with.
- You've got one second...

10:43.268 --> 10:46.304
So was that kid in the hall really dead?

10:52.277 --> 10:54.732
Yeah... He was.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.279
God. I've never seen
a real dead person before, have you?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.991
- No.
- No.

11:01.119 --> 11:06.077
Most guys on campus are like you.
They're normal, sweet.

11:06.207 --> 11:10.537
- I don't know why I was studying with him.
- It looked pretty bad.

11:10.670 --> 11:16.340
I had pepper spray right on my keys,
but I was just... "Is this really happening?"

11:16.468 --> 11:20.465
You had a brain freeze.
I get them all the time.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.218
Yes. Sometimes I wish I could just, like...

11:23.350 --> 11:26.434
be awake, in the moment,
when it's happening.

11:26.561 --> 11:30.689
Or have a pause button or something,
so you have time to react.

11:30.815 --> 11:34.730
Yeah. Exactly. I'm such
an expert on life after shit happens.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.434
God, life is just too fast.

11:37.572 --> 11:42.779
Is it wrong to decide someone
is great because they're so like you?

11:42.911 --> 11:45.828
Oh, shoot! I've got laundry at the coin-op.

11:45.955 --> 11:50.249
- I... I could give you a ride.
- A ride in what?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.950
- You have a car?
- Yeah.

11:53.088 --> 11:57.915
OK. This is going to sound so shallow,
but I like to guess what people drive.

11:58.051 --> 12:02.298
- Yeah. I'm curious too.
- OK. Um...

12:02.430 --> 12:04.968
I think that you would rather walk

12:05.100 --> 12:09.477
than drive something
that didn't suit you, so...

12:09.604 --> 12:15.310
I'm gonna go with...
classic Trans Am, red.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.479
-That's incredible.
- Uncanny.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.987
- Oh, my God. I got it right?
- Yes!

12:24.661 --> 12:27.615
In fact, I'm gonna go and get it now.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.870
- A red one?
- Yeah.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.374
Mason? Don't forget our, uh... thing.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.703
Yeah.

12:40.927 --> 12:44.296
He's kinda cute. Aren't you guys...?

12:44.431 --> 12:47.004
Oh, no! No.

12:48.059 --> 12:51.060
So what's your major?

12:51.187 --> 12:54.556
Oh, my God.
That's so queer. What's your name?

12:54.691 --> 12:59.068
Rube said don't get close
to the living, stay on the periphery.

12:59.195 --> 13:03.525
Don't tell her who you are.
Give her your undead name.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.066
- I'm Millie.
- Charlotte.

13:07.120 --> 13:12.541
- I know. Shaking hands is so weird.
- You wanna go get some coffee?

13:12.667 --> 13:17.246
That's what you say
when someone's having a fucked-up day.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.465
Is that what it says
in the "Bad Decisions" manual?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.335
Page three.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.627
Is your friend gonna be OK?

13:24.763 --> 13:27.467
- Yeah. He'll be fine.
- OK.

13:33.605 --> 13:37.934
As you get older,
the chance of making a good new friend

13:38.068 --> 13:41.483
is about the same as being hit by a truck.

13:41.613 --> 13:45.313
And if you're hit by a truck,
which is to say dead,

13:45.450 --> 13:48.783
the chances of making a good friend
are even slimmer.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.996
So when I remembered
my lunch date with Charlotte,

13:52.123 --> 13:55.824
I felt something new since I died -
I felt lucky.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.300
Mason was feeling something new too.

14:06.971 --> 14:11.598
Meanwhile, Roxy was just doing her job,
working for the man,

14:11.726 --> 14:13.849
when she ran into a bad one.

14:13.978 --> 14:18.142
- All right. Take it back.
- Ticket's written. They don't go back.

14:18.274 --> 14:22.771
Fine. Then why don't you shove
those tickets where the sun don't shine?

14:22.904 --> 14:27.862
Step aside, sir. As I told you yesterday,
if you have a complaint there's a system.

14:28.827 --> 14:32.361
Your system can suck my dick, miss. OK?

14:32.497 --> 14:35.249
I ain't ever gonna pay
those fucking tickets,

14:35.375 --> 14:38.495
so just put them
in your fucking pocket and walk off.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.202
- You need to step off.
- Step off?

14:42.257 --> 14:44.131
Step off?

14:47.804 --> 14:51.387
OK. OK! Step off!

14:51.516 --> 14:53.805
Sir! That is city property!

14:53.935 --> 14:58.846
You're not listening! I ain't ever gonna
pay those tickets, so you take 'em back!

14:58.982 --> 15:02.149
I don't give a fuck
about your goddamn fucking rules!

15:02.277 --> 15:05.728
- You take these goddamn tickets back!
- Hold up now!

15:05.864 --> 15:10.158
I can tolerate you cursing, screaming at me,
disrespecting my vehicle,

15:10.285 --> 15:14.283
but don't you ever put your hands on me.

15:21.796 --> 15:26.957
That's when Roxy decided
she didn't care about breaking the rules.

15:31.056 --> 15:35.552
Let me tell you something.
I am trying to do my job -

15:35.685 --> 15:37.974
which is definitely my day job.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.978
If you keep fucking with me,

15:40.106 --> 15:45.148
I have other skills that will give your life
a turn for the strange and painful.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.986
Do you understand me?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.931
Shakespeare sonnets?

16:16.059 --> 16:20.009
What an elegant, slender volume.
Is your coffee table uneven?

16:22.357 --> 16:26.520
Wait. Is there a girl?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.607
Someone special you want to shag?

16:29.739 --> 16:32.657
I don't want to shag her, Daisy.

16:34.119 --> 16:39.361
I do want to shag her,
but not in the usual way. I... like her.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.452
- Oh, my.
- She's different.

16:44.587 --> 16:49.546
She's sweet. She's sophisticated.
She's a college girl.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.463
A college girl? Hm.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.131
What is that supposed to mean?

16:56.266 --> 16:58.721
Nothing. How did you meet?

16:58.852 --> 17:03.430
I hit some bloke on the head
who was trying to date-rape her.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.815
- A story to tell the grandkids.
- Forget it.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.146
Mason, come on.
It's strange seeing you this way.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.271
- She's different.
- I get that.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.906
- Not too different.
- Oh, no. It'll be fine.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.239
You'll show her there's
more to life than learning.

17:19.372 --> 17:23.500
She'll teach you about salad forks
and the romantic poets

17:23.626 --> 17:27.126
and you'll teach her
about car theft and amphetamines.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.630
Fuck you, Daisy.

17:32.886 --> 17:36.800
I'm sorry. I hope it all works out, honey.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.474
You like lunch, Millie?

17:42.687 --> 17:46.851
- Oh... Actually I have plans today.
- Really?

17:46.983 --> 17:51.811
- Yeah. It's kind of a lunch date.
- Oh.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.153
I mean, not a date date.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.456
Millie...

18:11.508 --> 18:15.090
I hope you don't feel uncomfortable
saying no to me.

18:15.220 --> 18:19.597
It doesn't have to be awkward.
You don't have to lie.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.432
I'm not.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.182
- I'm not angry.
- OK.

18:25.313 --> 18:28.314
- There'll be plenty of lunches.
- Uh-huh.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.273
So don't worry about having "plans".

18:34.781 --> 18:38.826
But I really do have a lunch date.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.411
OK.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.454
It's just your honesty is important

18:43.581 --> 18:47.282
and I think you sometimes forget
I have been where you are.

18:47.419 --> 18:51.084
I have been young and alone.
I will simply say this.

18:51.214 --> 18:56.374
As you grow, being a loner stops
being something you are ashamed of

18:56.511 --> 18:59.962
and becomes something you treasure.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.099
Hi, Millie. Sorry I'm late. Are you ready?

19:04.269 --> 19:05.597
Yeah.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.389
Bye.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.227
- Do you like to shop?
- It's OK.

19:11.359 --> 19:14.111
I'm not like a freak about it or anything.

19:14.237 --> 19:18.899
Well, I know it sounds girly,
but I love clothes.

19:19.034 --> 19:23.280
Two words I've never heard before -
"cute top".

19:23.413 --> 19:28.573
Well, unlike you, I get
all my self-esteem from my appearance.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.497
Two words I've also never heard before.

19:33.631 --> 19:37.380
- Want to know a secret?
- Absolutely. I love secrets.

19:37.510 --> 19:41.045
- I have never had a manicure.
- Jesus!

19:41.181 --> 19:44.182
OK, no. Too much, too soon.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.302
Oh, my God.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.515
- Have you heard from the asshole?
- No. I haven't seen him.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.225
I filed a report with the campus police.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.648
You know what totally sucked
about the whole thing?

19:59.783 --> 20:04.076
- That he tried to rape you?
- Yeah, besides that.

20:05.246 --> 20:09.743
The sonnets. I love the sonnets
and he tainted them for me.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.545
This is where I felt it first.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.755
The universe was cocking
the fuck-with-me gun.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.669
"That time of year
thou mayst in me behold

20:18.802 --> 20:22.716
When yellow leaves,
or none, or few, do hang

20:22.847 --> 20:26.347
Upon those boughs
which shake against the cold,

20:26.476 --> 20:32.146
Bare ruin'd choirs,
where late the sweet birds sang..."

20:32.273 --> 20:37.268
I'm taking this incredible seminar.
The professor's a trip. You should come.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.811
Bang!

20:39.948 --> 20:43.364
"When yellow leaves,
or none, or few, do hang

20:43.493 --> 20:47.111
Upon those boughs
which shake against the cold,

20:47.247 --> 20:51.992
Bare ruin'd choirs,
where late the sweet birds sang..."

20:52.127 --> 20:56.290
Shakespeare's trying to paint
that emotional moment of a love lost.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.546
I know it's so old school.

20:58.675 --> 21:03.633
A tree in winter, boughs shaking
against the cold. Blah, blah, blah...

21:03.763 --> 21:06.254
It's so familiar.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.716
But let me ask you a question.

21:08.852 --> 21:12.102
Who here has had their heart broken?

21:13.565 --> 21:15.142
OK.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.730
Now we know
who the dramatic ones are.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.652
But here's my point.

21:19.779 --> 21:23.397
When you're suffering,
and I mean truly suffering,

21:23.533 --> 21:26.451
it's the clichÃ©s that heal you.

21:26.578 --> 21:30.789
When I'm sad,
give me George Jones or Willie Nelson.

21:30.915 --> 21:35.328
That's the brilliance of these sonnets.
They state the obvious.

21:35.462 --> 21:39.625
ClichÃ©s are clichÃ©s because
they are the things that have stuck.

21:39.758 --> 21:43.257
Our greatest arrogance
is to believe that we are all special

21:43.386 --> 21:47.598
because the truth is
we are all unbelievably the same.

21:47.724 --> 21:53.228
Watching this man entertain,
be sweet and insightful and touching,

21:53.355 --> 21:55.762
I was struck with one question.

21:55.899 --> 22:00.561
Who was this guy
and what had he done with my father?

22:00.695 --> 22:03.696
Excuse me, Professor Lass.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.275
- Hi. Um... Sandy?
- Charlotte.

22:07.410 --> 22:12.156
- Why do I even try?
- I just wanted my friend to meet you.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.789
- I love your class.
- Thank you. Hi.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.461
Hi.

22:17.587 --> 22:21.122
I'm teaching the comedies
next semester. It's lighter.

22:21.257 --> 22:24.543
I love that poem.

22:24.678 --> 22:28.129
It was helpful. Especially
the part about not being alone.

22:30.308 --> 22:34.353
That's when I knew
I'd never met Clancy Lass before.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.433
I don't know if anyone in my family had.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.150
I brought home a stray cat once.

22:42.278 --> 22:47.355
You're not a baby, George. I think
you're old enough to see our side of this.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.948
We can take him to an animal shelter.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.117
- They'll kill him!
- They won't.

22:52.247 --> 22:55.413
They'll find some nice family
to take care of him.

22:55.542 --> 22:59.539
I don't want him in some nice family.
I want him in this family!

22:59.671 --> 23:03.538
There is a baby in the house now.
It's not a debate.

23:03.675 --> 23:06.510
- This sucks. You do what you want.
- Georgia.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.590
- You're the worst dad ever!
- Go to your room.

23:10.515 --> 23:14.892
I wanted a kitty cat
and I got a little sister instead.

23:15.937 --> 23:20.682
As simple as that, that was the end
of something between me and my dad.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.688
I started sleeping in
on Sunday mornings.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.904
It never occurred to me
that he hadn't changed,

23:27.032 --> 23:29.273
that it was my fault.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.698
I'd just become a teenager.

23:31.828 --> 23:35.446
Did he have a Coke for breakfast
when I wasn't there?

23:54.726 --> 23:58.059
- Holy shit!
- I knew you'd come back.

23:58.188 --> 24:02.980
- I have to give you a ticket.
- Thank you. I wrote you something too.

24:04.611 --> 24:09.024
I realised that
when you did the thing that you did

24:09.157 --> 24:11.482
there were no words to describe it,

24:11.618 --> 24:15.947
so I came up with some words
that would help other people understand.

24:17.582 --> 24:23.087
"Haggleblass" - the argument with God.
What happened between you and me.

24:23.213 --> 24:26.712
"Stubblerud" - the moment
when there's no turning back,

24:26.841 --> 24:29.926
when the human
needs to be taught a lesson...

24:30.053 --> 24:33.504
- Hang on, sir.
- Don't call me sir. Don't call me sir.

24:33.640 --> 24:38.302
I am nothing but a "whispernaut" -
an unworthy one in your presence.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.682
- Jesus.
- Are you Jesus?

24:42.816 --> 24:46.765
No, I'm not Jesus!
What's your name anyway?

24:48.279 --> 24:51.399
Before the Haggleblass,
they called me Chuck.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.241
OK, Chuck.

24:53.368 --> 24:57.282
Now, I think what happened
to you before...

24:57.414 --> 25:00.035
.. was something you imagined.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.788
Maybe you had a stroke or something.

25:02.919 --> 25:05.754
When you separated
my soul from my body...

25:05.880 --> 25:08.122
That didn't happen.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.627
.. you cured me of all my anger.

25:13.763 --> 25:16.883
In one moment,
you gave me all the answers.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.305
Nothing happened.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.512
Everything happened.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.688
Everything.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.479
Damn.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.362
Everything.

25:49.466 --> 25:52.217
- Hello, Georgie.
- I don't know where she is.

25:52.344 --> 25:55.131
- Give me her number.
- She's not interested.

25:55.263 --> 25:59.475
If she were interested, she would
have mentioned you. She didn't.

25:59.601 --> 26:04.512
Ask her about me. No, don't ask her
because you'll stress the negative.

26:04.647 --> 26:08.692
- Ask her about me, Georgie.
- I'll ask her about you.

26:08.818 --> 26:12.022
With that expression on your face?
Fuck it!

26:13.406 --> 26:15.363
Fuck you.

26:16.659 --> 26:19.495
I'll show you.
We'll be like Romeo and Juliet.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.290
You do know how that story ended?

26:22.415 --> 26:25.250
If Romeo had just masturbated
a few times a week,

26:25.377 --> 26:28.543
he would have saved those families
a heap of trouble.

26:28.672 --> 26:33.380
- Hey.
- Charlotte? What time is it?

26:33.510 --> 26:36.464
- We were going to meet out front.
- I'm early.

26:38.348 --> 26:43.591
Daisy Adair. I've heard so much about you
I feel I know you already.

26:43.728 --> 26:47.062
And you know Mason.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.895
Of course. My hero.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.233
Well, we'd better be going.

26:53.405 --> 26:57.105
- Ah... hi.
- Hello.

26:58.076 --> 27:00.234
This is my friend, Charlotte.

27:00.370 --> 27:05.577
Charlotte,
this is my stepdad and his wife.

27:05.709 --> 27:08.116
We really have to go.

27:08.253 --> 27:11.123
- Nice to meet you, Charlotte. Honey?
- Huh?

27:11.256 --> 27:15.752
Can you run an errand for me?
It's just a few blocks away.

27:15.885 --> 27:18.555
Do it for your stepdad?

27:20.849 --> 27:24.716
- Sure. No problem.
- You might wanna hurry.

27:32.068 --> 27:36.362
- Oh, my God. Did you see that?
- Yeah.

27:42.162 --> 27:47.073
Now that looks a little more interesting.

27:49.919 --> 27:53.502
And now, for his next trick,

27:53.631 --> 27:56.716
the great Etienne will juggle...

27:56.843 --> 27:59.132
.. knives.

28:01.806 --> 28:04.926
- This is the errand you're running?
- I think it is.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.136
Your step-dad needs a juggler?

28:07.270 --> 28:11.138
He's throwing a party for his wife.
He needs entertainment.

28:11.274 --> 28:14.560
That is so awesome. Give me a dollar.

28:14.694 --> 28:19.321
Eddie Dienes, do not give that man money.
You're encouraging stupidity.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.951
Stupid needs to make a living too.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.163
I'm sorry...

28:29.459 --> 28:31.617
Do you know that guy's name?

28:31.753 --> 28:35.453
I don't know. It's something French
or equally fucked up.

28:39.219 --> 28:41.342
Let's go get some lunch.

28:41.471 --> 28:44.342
What about the juggler?
Your step-dad's party?

28:44.474 --> 28:48.306
Too dangerous.
I don't wanna see anyone die.

28:48.436 --> 28:51.271
What's wrong?

28:51.398 --> 28:54.352
Jugglers just freak me out.

29:12.627 --> 29:14.834
Watch out, dude! Whoa!

29:21.636 --> 29:24.673
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

29:27.434 --> 29:31.348
- I didn't know you smoked a pipe.
- You need to fix this.

29:31.479 --> 29:33.353
He put his hands on me.

29:33.481 --> 29:38.274
Being pissed off isn't a reason to remove
a person's soul from their body.

29:38.403 --> 29:41.938
- Don't do that again.
- I didn't know he'd turn into a nut-ball.

29:42.073 --> 29:45.193
How would you have responded?
God appeared to him.

29:45.326 --> 29:47.319
I wouldn't be making up words.

29:47.454 --> 29:50.704
He's creating a mythology
to take back to his people.

29:50.832 --> 29:54.331
Joseph Smith
had the same thing happen to him.

29:54.461 --> 29:56.169
This is nothing.

29:56.296 --> 29:59.961
In 100 years, people will have
little plastic meter-maids.

30:00.091 --> 30:03.128
- What do you want me to do?
- Restore the status quo.

30:03.261 --> 30:07.341
The guy wasn't supposed to get
enlightened, but get a ticket.

30:07.474 --> 30:10.890
You gotta turn him back into a prick.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.806
If you ever take someone's soul again
without a Post-it,

30:15.940 --> 30:18.977
I'm gonna break this pipe off in your ass.

30:21.029 --> 30:25.323
- They do look like chickens.
- You can't see it right-side up.

30:36.670 --> 30:39.339
Do you think he looks sad?

30:39.464 --> 30:42.714
- Who?
- Professor Lass.

30:44.260 --> 30:48.128
- I don't know.
- I guess not, huh?

30:50.141 --> 30:54.887
- You do know his story, right?
- What story?

30:56.147 --> 31:00.774
His daughter was the girl
that was killed by the falling toilet seat.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.856
- No shit? That was his daughter?
- Yeah.

31:04.989 --> 31:08.939
I think his relationship with his wife
is totally fucked-up.

31:10.954 --> 31:14.287
- How do you know all this?
- I don't know.

31:14.416 --> 31:16.657
He gives away clues in class.

31:18.128 --> 31:21.793
- People talk.
- Does he talk about it?

31:21.923 --> 31:25.209
- His wife?
- His daughter. The one that...

31:25.343 --> 31:30.171
- He doesn't really say anything.
- I guess he doesn't really think about it.

31:31.808 --> 31:36.719
No. No, it's there...
in how he talks about the poems.

31:38.523 --> 31:41.192
I don't know. You can tell his heart...

31:42.569 --> 31:44.111
He's suffering.

31:44.237 --> 31:49.029
It's so stupid, but
I had this one sonnet framed...

31:49.159 --> 31:53.203
I thought it might help him.
I never gave it to him though.

31:53.329 --> 31:55.406
What was it?

31:56.541 --> 31:59.577
I memorised it. I know, I'm such a geek.

32:01.254 --> 32:03.460
"No longer mourn for me when I am dead

32:03.590 --> 32:07.125
Nay, if you read this line, remember not,

32:07.260 --> 32:09.881
The hand that writ it, for I love you so,

32:10.013 --> 32:13.346
That in your sweet thoughts
I'd be forgot,

32:13.475 --> 32:16.226
If thinking on me then
should make you woe."

32:18.063 --> 32:21.229
You know, move on,
she'd want it that way.

32:23.693 --> 32:26.363
I think that's a mistake.

32:26.488 --> 32:30.735
Well, I just thought that maybe
it would give him some comfort.

32:30.867 --> 32:36.074
- He seems ready to move on. I don't know.
- That's right. You don't know.

32:36.206 --> 32:40.618
- I didn't realise what time it is. I gotta go.
- Hey, uh...

32:40.752 --> 32:42.330
Charlotte had hurt me.

32:42.462 --> 32:46.923
So I told her I never wanted to see her again
the best way.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.126
I'll call you.

32:51.888 --> 32:54.640
One of the silver linings of dying

32:54.766 --> 33:00.140
is watching the people you love lose
their shit 'cause they miss you so much.

33:00.271 --> 33:02.679
I was having trouble seeing it here.

33:03.733 --> 33:10.068
I had to wonder. Maybe it was so easy for
my dad to say goodbye to me two months ago

33:10.198 --> 33:14.492
was that he had already said goodbye
to me a long time before that.

33:25.338 --> 33:27.912
Someone's knocking at the door.

33:33.388 --> 33:36.389
I'm not gonna let you break up with me.

33:36.516 --> 33:39.434
OK. I'm here to apologise.
This is for you.

33:42.731 --> 33:47.439
Ah...
You didn't do anything wrong, Charlotte.

33:48.486 --> 33:51.404
I'm just screwed up.

33:52.490 --> 33:57.615
This is the part in our friendship
where we start to admit that we're not perfect.

34:01.791 --> 34:05.741
- What is that noise?
- Cute top.

34:08.089 --> 34:12.039
So do you wanna go do something?

34:12.177 --> 34:14.846
Sure.

34:18.683 --> 34:20.759
- No.
- I was, er...

34:20.893 --> 34:23.764
I was passing.
I'm going out for the evening

34:23.897 --> 34:27.940
and I thought I'd stop by
and see some old friends.

34:28.068 --> 34:30.274
Mason, you look stunning.

34:31.321 --> 34:35.568
Wait. I'm getting the image
of a naked Jehovah's Witness

34:35.699 --> 34:38.571
bleeding by a dumpster somewhere.

34:38.703 --> 34:42.368
Oh, Charlotte. What a pleasant surprise.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.906
- Hello, Mason.
- We're going out.

34:45.043 --> 34:49.835
- Really? I would love to join you.
- Well, it's girls' night out.

34:49.964 --> 34:54.176
We're going to lesbian bars
to make out with big women.

34:54.302 --> 34:56.342
You can't come.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.843
- Erm...
- Uh... bye.

35:02.727 --> 35:04.969
Oh, give it up.

35:06.731 --> 35:09.732
- I like her.
- Sweetie...

35:09.859 --> 35:13.109
That woman will give her heart
to a nice young man

35:13.238 --> 35:15.907
who wears reading glasses
and a tweed jacket

35:16.032 --> 35:20.659
and who has never done blow
off the belly of a dead prostitute.

35:20.787 --> 35:23.278
- I like her.
- I know.

35:24.457 --> 35:26.533
She doesn't like you.

35:33.008 --> 35:35.499
I can't believe I was carded.

35:40.849 --> 35:45.475
- You do look like you're ten years old.
- Shut up. I look at least 14.

35:45.603 --> 35:48.177
And the giggling didn't help much.

35:49.816 --> 35:52.141
Sorry I freaked out on you today.

35:52.277 --> 35:57.235
I was thinking about that.
I shouldn't give Professor Lass the poem.

35:57.365 --> 36:01.445
I don't know.
Maybe it's not so crazy after all.

36:01.578 --> 36:04.116
It doesn't mean anything coming from me.

36:05.665 --> 36:08.417
I have never lost anything in my life.

36:08.543 --> 36:12.707
I've had this completely shallow,
safe existence.

36:12.839 --> 36:15.757
- Well, don't knock it.
- I'm a virgin.

36:17.010 --> 36:21.221
- Yeah. I'm in college and I'm a virgin.
- Loser.

36:21.348 --> 36:25.392
- Ah, you too?
- That depends on your definition.

36:25.518 --> 36:28.519
Um... Ever been laid?

36:28.646 --> 36:33.641
- Then, yes, technically I am a virgin.
- Thank you.

36:38.490 --> 36:42.867
Look, I know you've been through stuff.
I can just sense it.

36:42.994 --> 36:45.319
You kind of remind me of him.

36:45.455 --> 36:48.076
The way he talks about love...

36:49.417 --> 36:51.410
.. and loss.

36:51.544 --> 36:57.748
Oh, his eyes... I'm just gonna give it to him.
I'm gonna give him the sonnet.

36:57.884 --> 37:00.292
Right. Cheers.

37:39.384 --> 37:46.217
I had your car towed. It's gonna cost you $3775
to get it back plus all the tickets.

37:46.349 --> 37:50.762
They busted your door trying to get in,
so kiss your car radio goodbye.

37:52.814 --> 37:54.890
You're a vengeful god.

37:55.984 --> 38:02.152
I can appreciate that you think
you had some kind of revelation.

38:03.283 --> 38:05.904
But I am just a meter maid

38:06.036 --> 38:08.361
and you are just a dumb-ass redneck.

38:09.748 --> 38:15.287
That's who we are. So we can forget
all this bullshit and just get on with it.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.955
- Who is this?
- This is Jason.

38:19.090 --> 38:24.048
I told Jason about the Haggleblass
and he's begun his conversion.

38:24.179 --> 38:26.421
Haven't you, buddy?

38:26.556 --> 38:29.640
Can you give us a minute, Jason?

38:30.727 --> 38:32.850
- Go on.
- Fuck off. OK?

38:35.023 --> 38:38.890
I know you do this
just to make me stronger. I know it.

38:39.027 --> 38:43.570
Chucky... I want you to listen to me, OK?

38:43.698 --> 38:45.572
God made a mistake.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.238
He wants you back the way you were.

38:48.370 --> 38:51.952
God wants you to be an asshole.

38:52.957 --> 38:56.706
So you can forget all this Haggleblassing.

38:56.836 --> 39:01.048
He wants you to be
your old jackass self again.

39:06.971 --> 39:11.016
OK. This is a test.
There's nothing that you could do...

39:11.142 --> 39:14.143
.. to make me go back to my old self.
Nothing.

39:14.270 --> 39:15.646
Nothing, nothing...

39:21.820 --> 39:22.851
No...

39:28.076 --> 39:29.867
No! Fuck!

39:29.994 --> 39:32.450
- That's what I'm talking about.
- God!

39:32.580 --> 39:34.620
- What's my name?
- Fat ass bitch!

39:34.749 --> 39:39.495
That's right! That's who you are, baby.
That is who you are!

39:41.965 --> 39:45.464
So here I was,
sitting opposite my father,

39:45.593 --> 39:50.670
my friend about to give him a poem
encouraging him to let go of me forever.

39:50.807 --> 39:54.057
And I thought things were twisted
when I was alive.

39:54.185 --> 39:56.641
I didn't mean the message to be dramatic.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.515
I like drama.

39:58.648 --> 40:01.602
I hope we're not pulling you away
from your family.

40:01.735 --> 40:04.854
That's OK.
What did you want to talk about?

40:04.988 --> 40:07.823
Charlotte wanted to give him a poem

40:07.949 --> 40:11.484
and I wanted to ask him
about his oldest daughter.

40:11.619 --> 40:13.861
If he thought about me.

40:13.997 --> 40:16.369
So the comedies next semester?

40:17.500 --> 40:19.540
Fun, huh?

40:19.669 --> 40:22.836
We just wanted to take you out to lunch.

40:22.964 --> 40:27.959
What you say in your class really makes us think
and we wanted to say thank you.

40:29.054 --> 40:32.802
Charlotte was chickening out.
I should have too.

40:32.932 --> 40:36.930
But I was the only dead girl I knew
who could get an answer.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.635
So do you miss your daughter?

40:45.653 --> 40:47.942
You know...

40:48.073 --> 40:52.533
I think that poets do the world a favour
by turning themselves inside out.

40:54.204 --> 40:57.454
- I teach poetry. That's close enough.
- You don't have to...

40:57.582 --> 40:59.409
When she was younger...

41:00.669 --> 41:03.041
.. we'd been very close.

41:04.089 --> 41:07.588
I thought it was this bond
that could never be broken,

41:07.717 --> 41:10.718
but it was, almost effortlessly.

41:12.472 --> 41:16.256
I knew that she had to grow
and grow apart from me.

41:17.310 --> 41:21.059
I had faith that if I just didn't meddle,

41:21.189 --> 41:24.688
if I let her fly away,

41:24.818 --> 41:27.309
eventually she would come back to me.

41:31.574 --> 41:34.694
I didn't know
that was all the time we'd have.

41:38.289 --> 41:41.540
Jeez! God, I am sorry.

41:41.668 --> 41:43.791
OK. Hang on.

41:47.757 --> 41:49.880
Can I get a towel or something?

42:00.645 --> 42:03.136
That's how my dad moved on -

42:03.273 --> 42:05.942
with a little help from his friends.

42:15.285 --> 42:20.279
My dad was right. Human beings
are simple, predictable clichÃ©s.

42:22.876 --> 42:28.581
Broken hearts, betrayal.
It's all been done a billion times before.

42:29.758 --> 42:34.051
The problem is every time
still hurts like the first.

42:39.392 --> 42:41.883
And if you're lucky enough to recover,

42:42.020 --> 42:46.896
you can be sure that just as you finish
filling in all the cracks in your life,

42:47.025 --> 42:49.730
the next one is starting to open.
