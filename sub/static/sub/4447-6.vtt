08:54.125 --> 08:55.583
hot out there
in your shorts.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.417
Mm-hmm. The sugar train
has left the station.

08:58.417 --> 08:59.500
Alice.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.792
If you're not with us

09:00.792 --> 09:03.084
you're not with me.

09:03.084 --> 09:06.542
Oh. Fine.
That goes both ways.

09:06.542 --> 09:09.042
So, as of this moment, Alice,
you are officially

09:09.042 --> 09:10.458
banned from my pants.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.125
Whatever will I do
to while away the nights

09:13.125 --> 09:16.125
in my dorm full
of beautiful cheerleaders?

09:16.125 --> 09:18.208
I'm thinking
negligee tickle fights.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.208
Y'all need a camera for that?

09:36.542 --> 09:38.000
Mom, I'm home.

09:41.042 --> 09:43.625
Mom. Hello?

09:45.125 --> 09:47.250
- Mama.
- Think fast.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.167
[laughs]

09:49.167 --> 09:51.000
There's those quick reflexes.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.166
What's up, dad?

09:52.166 --> 09:53.250
I thought you'd be
at work, dad.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.417
Ah, you know,
union says use

09:54.417 --> 09:57.084
my vacation days
or lose them, you know.

09:57.084 --> 09:59.625
How's school? Still, so,
killin' it, like always?

09:59.625 --> 10:02.125
- You know it.
- Yeah.

10:06.583 --> 10:09.125
Oh, man, not this again.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.166
That was in the mailbox?

10:13.291 --> 10:15.834
Like, why now,
after two years?

10:18.875 --> 10:21.417
This has gotta
be Red Raymond.

10:21.417 --> 10:23.167
You think so?

10:23.167 --> 10:25.209
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

10:25.209 --> 10:27.084
New coach's offense
isn't clicking

10:27.084 --> 10:29.583
so, he tries to pull me
back into football.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.583
Man, this was,
this was supposed to be over.

10:31.583 --> 10:32.959
Why don't you just give
me the envelope?

10:32.959 --> 10:34.042
I-I'll take care of it.

10:34.042 --> 10:36.166
You got enough to worry about.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.667
No, this is my mess.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.166
I'll handle it.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.042
Coach?

10:57.042 --> 10:58.041
Yeah?

10:58.041 --> 11:00.333
You know who I am?

11:03.167 --> 11:05.834
Lewis Flynn. 4-5 40.
28-inch vert.

11:05.834 --> 11:08.959
Good hands.
Hard to bring down.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.708
Created a stink
and asked to be released

11:10.708 --> 11:14.542
from his
football scholarship...
to become a Hellcat.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.291
Yeah, playing by the rules
shouldn't cause a stink.

11:16.291 --> 11:17.417
You know, my maiden auntie

11:17.417 --> 11:20.250
had that quilted
on a pot holder.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.125
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a lot of film to watch

11:22.125 --> 11:23.917
and not much time
for quitters.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.167
Look, man,
I'm not coming back.

11:27.125 --> 11:30.209
- Coming back to what?
- To football.

11:32.083 --> 11:35.542
Good, 'cause I don't
want you back.

11:35.542 --> 11:37.209
Now, get out
of my training facility

11:37.209 --> 11:38.375
before I have you thrown out.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.625
Explain where this came from.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I know nothing about this.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.291
Well, it arrived
at my house this morning

11:47.291 --> 11:49.042
just like it used to.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.834
And I want it to stop.

11:50.834 --> 11:54.042
The dirty football
is why I quit the team, coach.

11:54.042 --> 11:56.333
And I don't want
any part of that.

11:57.834 --> 11:59.625
Neither do I.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.792
You didn't have anything
to do with this?

12:04.792 --> 12:07.167
- I did not.
- Then who did?

12:08.042 --> 12:09.542
Come with me.

12:12.417 --> 12:16.375
Ah, I speak of the devil,
and he walks into my office.

12:18.375 --> 12:21.125
Well, you know, you've always
got a box at Lancer.

12:21.125 --> 12:22.542
Okay. Goodbye.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.750
[chuckles]
Governor of this
great state wants you

12:25.750 --> 12:27.167
to work on your offense

12:27.167 --> 12:29.458
'as if that's some kind
of revelation.'

12:31.291 --> 12:33.583
You look pretty steamed, Red.

12:35.583 --> 12:38.708
We're on probation, Bill.
This envelope shows up?

12:38.708 --> 12:39.959
You're playing with fire.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.083
It never crossed your mind
that this job

12:41.083 --> 12:42.208
might get a little toasty?

12:42.208 --> 12:45.250
- Who's this?
- I'm Lewis Flynn.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.084
Oh, right.

12:47.084 --> 12:49.250
'Didn't recognize you
without a helmet.'

12:49.250 --> 12:51.208
I've got some messages
from your dad here.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.583
Look, man,
I don't want your money

12:52.583 --> 12:53.708
and I'm not coming back.

12:53.708 --> 12:55.417
I don't want any part
of any scandal.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.542
What makes you think
this envelope was for you?

12:57.542 --> 12:58.667
It was at my house.

12:58.667 --> 13:03.291
But...you live on campus
with cheerleaders.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.208
Delivering that money
to the wrong address?

13:05.208 --> 13:07.125
That just seems
a little foolish.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.250
So what are you saying?

13:08.250 --> 13:10.250
I'm saying that
this is a matter

13:10.250 --> 13:13.333
probably best discussed
amongst your family.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.667
What does it have to do
with my family?

13:15.667 --> 13:17.667
Cut out the games, Bill.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.250
Start with dad,
I mean, I've got

13:21.250 --> 13:22.542
what, one, two,
three messages?

13:22.542 --> 13:24.209
I wonder what he wants
to talk about.

13:24.209 --> 13:25.333
Wait, no, no, no, wait,
you're trying to say

13:25.333 --> 13:26.834
my father
is on the take?

13:26.834 --> 13:29.000
For what? Why would you
even be paying him off?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.042
Did I say that
I was paying someone off?

13:31.042 --> 13:33.041
Red, you hear me say that?

13:34.458 --> 13:35.625
You're lying.

13:35.625 --> 13:36.708
'You're lying to my face'

13:36.708 --> 13:38.084
'cause that's what you do.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.000
(Bill)
'Mm-hmm.'

13:39.000 --> 13:41.542
This program is garbage

13:41.542 --> 13:43.625
'and you are, too.'

13:44.291 --> 13:46.625
To hell with both of you.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.333
Wow. Mouth on that kid, huh?

13:51.333 --> 13:55.750
- What'd I inherit here, Bill?
- How's that, Red?

13:55.750 --> 13:57.083
When I came here,
you promised me

13:57.083 --> 14:00.667
football would run clean,
and clearly, it isn't.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.083
Now, if you wanna keep me,
you need to tell me

14:02.083 --> 14:05.542
every last bit of dirt
that's still in this program.

14:05.542 --> 14:08.167
For that, I think
you'll need a drink.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.084
[rock music]

14:17.208 --> 14:19.917
Heads up, my loyal slaves.

14:19.917 --> 14:23.000
Now, you have all
tasted the stick.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.708
Now, prepare for the carrot.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.333
It's reward time.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.041
The most powerful party
in the US

14:30.041 --> 14:33.166
is not the Republicans
or the Democrats.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.500
It's the lobbyists.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.125
Special interests are the ones

14:36.125 --> 14:38.667
who run things
in DC and in Nashville.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.875
And on Saturday,
I'll be in Nashville..

14:41.875 --> 14:43.167
'...speaking
with lobbyists who are'

14:43.167 --> 14:45.792
interested in repealing
three strikes.

14:45.792 --> 14:49.708
The NAACP, Tennessee Bar
Association, and the ACLU.

14:49.708 --> 14:52.625
And all of you
are gonna come with me.

14:52.625 --> 14:56.208
Nashville. I'm gonna have
that place on lockdown.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.583
It's this Saturday?

14:59.583 --> 15:01.375
Yes, Miss Perkins.
This Saturday.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.125
And it's mandatory?

15:03.125 --> 15:05.667
Is your career mandatory?

15:08.125 --> 15:10.041
What's the problem?

15:10.041 --> 15:11.792
It's short notice.

15:13.042 --> 15:16.166
Well, I'm sorry I didn't send
a save the date card

15:16.166 --> 15:20.083
but I can assure you that this
trip will be worth your time.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.542
We're gonna be speaking

15:21.542 --> 15:23.542
with every shaker and mover
in the state.

15:23.542 --> 15:25.041
And every one
of these people

15:25.041 --> 15:26.959
is a potential summer
internship

15:26.959 --> 15:29.959
or law school rec
or a judge clerkship.

15:29.959 --> 15:32.084
Now, if you wanna get
into a decent law school

15:32.084 --> 15:34.208
you're gonna need
those connections.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.125
Now, Miss Wheeler,
I have some notes

15:37.125 --> 15:39.291
on this brief
that you prepared.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.542
What's with the hesitation?

15:43.542 --> 15:44.792
Not that it's any
of your business

15:44.792 --> 15:47.084
but I can't make the trip.

15:47.084 --> 15:49.084
The Hellcats are playing
the girls' volleyball team

15:49.084 --> 15:51.333
in flag football this weekend.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.875
[giggles]

15:52.875 --> 15:55.125
Hey, don't laugh at me.

15:55.708 --> 15:57.083
You don't laugh at me.

15:57.083 --> 15:58.917
I'm sorry, but come on.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.166
A flag football game?

16:01.166 --> 16:02.417
With cheerleaders?

16:02.417 --> 16:04.208
You're gonna miss out on
a career building opportunity

16:04.208 --> 16:05.625
for flag football?

16:05.625 --> 16:08.417
Look, it's not like
our presence helps Travis.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.708
It's a schmoozefest.

16:09.708 --> 16:10.792
Oh, too good for networking

16:10.792 --> 16:12.166
and lining up a summer gig?

16:12.166 --> 16:16.000
[sighs]
I promised.
The squad needs me.

16:17.084 --> 16:20.000
Sick out.
Say you have diarrhea.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.625
It's the ultimate excuse.

16:21.625 --> 16:22.708
No one ever questions it.

16:22.708 --> 16:24.125
They think,
who would be willing

16:24.125 --> 16:25.333
to say they have diarrhea

16:25.333 --> 16:26.834
if they didn't really
have diarrhea?

16:26.834 --> 16:28.375
Okay, please stop
saying that word.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.708
If you don't start
thinking like a lawyer

16:29.708 --> 16:31.209
and stop thinking
like a cheerleader

16:31.209 --> 16:33.250
a cheerleader is all
you're ever going to be.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.667
Yeah.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.250
[sighs]

16:44.417 --> 16:46.167
Lewis?

16:48.208 --> 16:50.208
What are you doing here?

16:51.625 --> 16:55.125
I spoke to Bill Marsh
today, dad.

16:55.125 --> 16:57.792
He told me that money
was meant for you.
Is that true?

16:58.583 --> 17:00.625
Watch how you talk to me.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.917
Is it true?

17:02.917 --> 17:04.750
Are you on the take?

17:04.750 --> 17:06.583
Don't you come in this house,
start accusing me--

17:06.583 --> 17:07.916
Is it true?

17:07.916 --> 17:09.333
I deserve
a straight answer, dad.

17:09.333 --> 17:11.041
Is it true?

17:14.083 --> 17:15.750
Yeah.

17:25.834 --> 17:28.583
Wake up, lazybones.
It's time to practice.

17:29.084 --> 17:30.208
[coughs]

17:31.083 --> 17:32.166
Are you okay?

17:32.166 --> 17:33.917
[coughs]

17:35.125 --> 17:37.417
I think I'm sick.

17:37.417 --> 17:39.083
You need a hot tea.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.083
Yeah. It hurts to talk.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.583
Yeah, feels like the flu.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.084
(Savannah)
Oh, no.

17:46.084 --> 17:47.792
Okay, I'm gonna bring you
some green tea.

17:47.792 --> 17:50.542
We've gotta get you healthy
before the game tomorrow.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.792
We're dead without you.

17:56.917 --> 17:59.083
Just think about law school.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.667
I haven't been taking
vacation days.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.042
Gibson cut back
my hours at work.

18:11.042 --> 18:13.500
Everybody's hours,
actually.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.125
I'm only working
20 hours a week now.

18:16.125 --> 18:19.375
Twenty hours? But you've been
there 30 years, dad.

18:19.375 --> 18:20.917
I know.

18:21.667 --> 18:22.792
What does this have to do with

18:22.792 --> 18:25.250
the Lancer
athletic department?

18:25.250 --> 18:27.834
Yeah, it all started when I..

18:28.625 --> 18:31.042
...I refinanced the mortgage.

18:31.042 --> 18:34.125
Turns out, the whole
neighborhood got hit

18:34.125 --> 18:35.333
with these predatory loans.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.084
You know, the Moores
lost their house

18:37.084 --> 18:38.458
and the whole rest
of the neighborhood

18:38.458 --> 18:40.083
is going to hell
in a handbasket.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.083
But when did you guys
get this mortgage?

18:42.083 --> 18:43.166
Two years ago.

18:43.166 --> 18:44.291
And I was able to stay afloat

18:44.291 --> 18:46.291
till last January
when they started

18:46.291 --> 18:48.583
cutting back
my hours at work.

18:50.084 --> 18:52.917
[sighs]
When the gas got turned off,
I had no choice.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.417
I had to call Bill Marsh.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.209
They-they turned off the gas?

18:56.209 --> 18:57.083
Dad, where was I?

18:57.083 --> 18:59.917
At school,
where I wanted you.

19:00.959 --> 19:02.167
[sighs]

19:02.167 --> 19:04.625
It started off
as just a one-time loan.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.708
Before I could pay it off,
another envelope came.

19:06.708 --> 19:08.834
And another one
came the next month.

19:08.834 --> 19:12.333
I don't know
why they kept coming,
but they were a godsend.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.917
It's 'cause you threatened
to go public, isn't it?

19:13.917 --> 19:15.625
No, no, I said
I wouldn't say anything

19:15.625 --> 19:18.125
about the pay-for-play stuff.

19:18.125 --> 19:21.250
