00:01.000 --> 00:03.719
<i>- Last time on</i> Star...
- I did hear that you conned

00:03.730 --> 00:05.160
your way into a job at Gravity.

00:05.210 --> 00:06.689
<i>Is it true you used the sex tape</i>

00:06.710 --> 00:08.380
- to kick off your solo career?
- No.

00:08.420 --> 00:10.279
- I did not cheat on you.
- Really, Derek?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.359
Are you gonna tell her about us?

00:11.360 --> 00:12.389
What do you think
is gonna happen if

00:12.390 --> 00:13.700
I let her know I'm a
criminal informant?

00:13.720 --> 00:14.800
<i>Then you shouldn't
have been caught</i>

00:14.820 --> 00:15.960
<i>with the Bankhead Crew.</i>

00:15.990 --> 00:17.239
<i>I've brought in a new headliner</i>

00:17.240 --> 00:18.799
<i>who is loud and
very controversial.</i>

00:18.800 --> 00:19.860
Lil Dini?

00:19.900 --> 00:22.680
"Noah, who has been inspiring

00:22.700 --> 00:24.500
<i>your love songs you've
been putting out?"</i>

00:24.530 --> 00:26.720
We made a beautiful baby.

00:26.830 --> 00:28.380
<i>I can't bring Kayla back.</i>

00:28.400 --> 00:30.880
- You still don't trust me?
- It's cool. I've been living

00:30.910 --> 00:32.819
- out this bag my whole life.
- I'm-a look suspect

00:32.820 --> 00:33.939
trying to clean all of this cash

00:33.940 --> 00:35.590
when you know I'm
trying to go legit.

00:35.610 --> 00:37.110
We got a rat problem.

00:37.150 --> 00:39.680
I was trying to figure out
what happened to my father.

I'm Kenneth Anderson,
one of the chairs

01:46.050 --> 01:47.840

Chamber of Commerce.

01:47.860 --> 01:49.000
It's good to meet you.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.056
I got to say, I'm grateful

prestigious as yours

01:52.260 --> 01:53.940

02:00.330 --> 02:02.660

yours at the gala tomorrow.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.940
You got it.

02:10.500 --> 02:12.139
Cassie.

02:12.140 --> 02:13.520
Cassie!

02:13.560 --> 02:15.000
You being honored?

02:15.080 --> 02:17.219
- It's nothing.
- And I thought you said it was over

02:17.220 --> 02:18.980
with you and that wife of yours.

02:19.010 --> 02:21.000
And now you taking
this bitch to a gala?

02:21.020 --> 02:22.850
You got no idea what
you're talking about.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.650
Actions speak louder
than words, okay?

02:25.660 --> 02:27.526
And all you've ever shown
me is that I'm nothing

02:27.550 --> 02:29.500
but the soles of
your damn shoes.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.340
And they ain't even designer.

02:31.590 --> 02:33.760

03:09.820 --> 03:11.240
Baby, what are you doing?

03:11.370 --> 03:13.000
Really?

03:13.130 --> 03:15.370
- I'm getting food.
- That's food?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.300
- Ten candy bars is food?
- Yep.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.140
Say something about my weight.
I dare you.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.140
This is not good for the baby.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.240
Don't put that back.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.310
I will fight you in this store.

03:25.350 --> 03:26.550
Okay, we'll do three.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.380
Okay? Compromise.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.190
Don't matter what I eat, anyway.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.150
These hips grow by
the inch every day.

03:33.190 --> 03:37.290
And I love every inch. Okay?

03:40.160 --> 03:42.530
Where are we gonna put
all this baby stuff?

03:42.560 --> 03:44.830
Think I'll put the crib
in my room at Carlotta's.

03:44.870 --> 03:47.300
Why are you so against
moving in with me?

03:47.340 --> 03:49.640
You do know we're
having a baby, right?

03:49.670 --> 03:51.550
Ma'am, I'm telling you, there
are no funds left on this card.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.920
No, there should be
still money on there.

03:52.940 --> 03:54.399
I just got my WIC on Thursday.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.780
It's okay, Mommy.
We can put it back.

03:56.810 --> 03:58.340
No, it's okay, baby, I got it.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.440
Can you try it again
or something, please?

04:07.690 --> 04:09.499
Thank you so much.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.960
You didn't have to do that.

04:11.060 --> 04:12.190
That's okay.

04:12.230 --> 04:14.730
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.200
Star, where are you going?

04:16.230 --> 04:18.640
Star? Yo.

04:19.529 --> 04:21.800
- What's wrong?
- Do you see that?

04:21.839 --> 04:23.220
What?

04:23.280 --> 04:24.639
That's why I'm not
moving in with you,

04:24.640 --> 04:25.646
because that's my biggest fear

04:25.670 --> 04:27.170
is having to depend
on somebody else.

04:27.210 --> 04:29.550
That lady can't even
provide for her own kid,

04:29.560 --> 04:30.640
and that kid was me.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.410
But it's not you anymore.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.319
And it won't be for our kid.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.719
When are you gonna wake up

04:35.720 --> 04:38.140
- and realize that you have it good?
- You know what?

04:38.160 --> 04:39.990
- It's okay. No, listen to me.
- Listen to me.

04:40.020 --> 04:41.550
We're not from the same place.

04:41.590 --> 04:44.400
You don't understand.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.630
Star, where are you going?

04:49.000 --> 04:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:58.220 --> 04:59.840
You have to talk to
me at some point.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.310
I know what I saw.

05:02.340 --> 05:03.770
That bottle service girl,

05:03.780 --> 05:05.810
or whatever she was,
was all up on you

05:05.820 --> 05:07.126
as if you didn't
have a girlfriend.

05:07.150 --> 05:09.340
Or maybe she liked what she saw
on the sex tape, I don't know.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.300
- It is not like that at all.
- Then tell me what that is.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.139
Explain why she was
hugged up on you,

05:14.140 --> 05:15.160
whispering in your ear.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.900
Alex, can you just please
trust me with this one?

05:20.620 --> 05:25.700
Just tell me why, after
all we've been through.

05:26.170 --> 05:28.060
I'm-a head out.

05:28.170 --> 05:29.620
Derek.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.480
Four.

05:43.580 --> 05:46.390
Three.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.150
Two.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.240
One.

06:07.210 --> 06:08.970
All right, look,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.510
we might as well get the
awkwardness over with.

06:11.550 --> 06:14.100
Megan and I worked things out.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.150
Look, whatever y'all got
going on I'm cool with

06:18.190 --> 06:19.890
as long it don't
interfere with our work.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.150
- Mm.
- I came to talk about business.

06:22.190 --> 06:24.360
- All right.
- We're two months out

06:24.390 --> 06:25.519
from the Rhythm and Bells Fest,

06:25.520 --> 06:27.840
and we got to get the fans
hyped about Karma Sound,

06:27.900 --> 06:30.110
which is why I'm paying
for this studio time.

06:30.180 --> 06:31.699
- But you slippin'.
- Slippin'?

06:31.700 --> 06:33.406
You ain't brought me a
hit since we started.

06:33.430 --> 06:34.670
Man, hits don't come overnight.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.399
Have you checked your
downloads lately?

06:36.400 --> 06:37.570
Your songs are pedestrian.

06:37.580 --> 06:39.180
I could get the same
sound from YouTube.

06:39.210 --> 06:40.956
Man, you must got me confused
with some other artist

06:40.980 --> 06:42.310
you playing with. All right?

06:42.340 --> 06:44.840
My plaques and my Grammys
speak for themselves.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.710
Oh, I get it.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.010
It's hard having staying power.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.599
One minute, they think
you got the goods.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.760
The next, they done with you.

06:52.790 --> 06:56.220
That's funny, 'cause I never had
an issue with staying power.

06:56.260 --> 06:59.560
In fact, I've been told I
stay a little too long.

06:59.590 --> 07:02.660
All I'm saying is you need
to step your game up.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.800
'Cause there's always
somebody out there

07:04.830 --> 07:06.460
that wants it just as bad.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.140
So what?

07:10.170 --> 07:11.900
That supposed to be
some kind of threat?

07:11.910 --> 07:14.970
Like I said...

07:15.010 --> 07:18.060
we talking business.

07:32.260 --> 07:35.220
_

07:36.720 --> 07:39.400
_

07:44.340 --> 07:47.460
- You're late.
- And you nasty,

07:47.500 --> 07:49.480
sitting here with your
damn feet on this table.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.740
You ain't got no home training?

07:50.780 --> 07:53.680
Just to be clear, none
of us work for you.

07:53.710 --> 07:55.310
We hardly respect you.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.430
- We're just here for Carlotta.
- We are strictly here

07:57.450 --> 08:00.190
to make sure Carlotta's
R&B Fest doesn't tank.

08:00.220 --> 08:01.596
Yeah, and to watch
your little chest

08:01.620 --> 08:03.020
heave when you get mad.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.360
See, look at it.

08:06.380 --> 08:09.230
- Can we get serious for a second?
- Let's.

08:09.260 --> 08:10.779
Now, we're at the homestretch,

08:10.780 --> 08:12.359
and the social media presence

08:12.360 --> 08:14.630
for the Rhythm and Bells
Festival needs to increase.

08:14.670 --> 08:16.780
The ticket holders need to
know the lay of the festival

08:16.800 --> 08:18.800
so they can maximize
their experience,

08:18.840 --> 08:21.470
and that's where our new
social media strategist,

08:21.510 --> 08:23.920
Chloe David, comes in.
Chloe, ladies.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.240
Ladies, Chloe.

08:25.260 --> 08:27.300
So you go waste money
on little plastic hos

08:27.320 --> 08:29.156
when I got the perfect
little Twitter fingers here.

08:29.180 --> 08:31.140
Do you have three
million followers?

08:31.360 --> 08:32.820
Or just the fingers?

08:32.850 --> 08:34.020
You social slut.

08:34.059 --> 08:36.320
I didn't think so.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.480
Chloe will be here all
day filming Noah.

08:38.539 --> 08:40.330
Gravity Media needs
to start engaging

08:40.340 --> 08:41.830
with its fans more directly.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.530
Excuse me.

08:45.470 --> 08:47.630
I hope you're ready for
a music experience

08:47.670 --> 08:49.760
like no other with the
Rhythm and Bells Festival.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.970
Now, we have several stages
featuring Gravity Media artists

08:53.010 --> 08:56.140
that you know and love, but
the main stage will showcase

08:56.180 --> 08:58.140
Noah Brooks like you've
never seen him before.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.359
He'll be performing his hits

08:59.360 --> 09:02.199
and his soon-to-be-classic
new album.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.820
You don't want to miss it.
Stay tuned.

09:04.850 --> 09:05.900
- Perfect.
- Cool.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.550
Yo, that was corny.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.380
And you didn't even
mention Take 3.

09:09.420 --> 09:10.460
Yeah, he did.

09:10.490 --> 09:12.020
He called us "Gravity artists."

09:12.060 --> 09:15.380
Okay, so we're gonna
be on the small stage

09:15.520 --> 09:16.859
while Noah's on the main one?

09:16.860 --> 09:18.000
You didn't hear what I said?

09:18.100 --> 09:19.959
You know, I think them little
tight-ass shirts you wear

09:19.960 --> 09:21.679
and them little juices and
berries you throw in your head

09:21.680 --> 09:23.740
done made your brain
stop circulating.

09:23.820 --> 09:24.900
You know damn good and well

09:24.910 --> 09:26.140
Carlotta created this festival

09:26.170 --> 09:28.210
to showcase these girls'
album, not Noah's.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.490
Noah don't have a hit out.

09:29.510 --> 09:32.010
We got "Madonna" in heavy
rotation right now.

09:32.050 --> 09:34.580
He's the comeback kid.
That's promotable.

09:34.620 --> 09:35.959
Bitch, go like a post.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.440
You're not gonna do this to us.

09:37.550 --> 09:39.490
Carlotta wouldn't let you.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.290
Look, Mateo hired me to handle
this thing as I see fit.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.540
This is how I see it.

09:47.290 --> 09:49.160
Thanks for the heads up, Don.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.400
I'll look into it.
I'll get back to you.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.600
Why the hell you not
returning my calls?

09:59.240 --> 10:01.380
You just gonna throw this
diamond up in my face

10:01.400 --> 10:03.110
and just go ghost on a bitch?

10:03.140 --> 10:04.740
I got bigger problems than that.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.950
If you want me to marry you,
you can't keep me hidden.

10:07.980 --> 10:09.620
I'm going to that gala.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.320
Cassie.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.690
You see, my contact...

10:14.720 --> 10:18.420
is telling me that Karma
is way too hot right now.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.030
What are you talking about?

10:20.060 --> 10:21.790
You remember that
rat problem we had

10:21.830 --> 10:23.800
that you were
supposed to handle?

10:23.830 --> 10:25.800
It ain't handled.

10:25.830 --> 10:27.330
It's affecting my business,

10:27.370 --> 10:29.270
which, in turn, affects
my reputation.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.970
And guess what. I
don't like that.

10:32.010 --> 10:33.460
So you mad at me for that?

10:33.760 --> 10:35.760
I never wanted to run
money through that club.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.040
That was for your punk ass.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.580
You're a sloppy bitch.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.920
Did you just call me a bitch?
Really?

10:43.950 --> 10:46.050
Get your damn hands off me.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.120
Fix it.

10:58.170 --> 11:01.060
Let me go, Xander.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.340
Now answer my other question.

11:06.470 --> 11:08.640
Will you marry me?

11:12.980 --> 11:14.760
Yeah.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.939
Maurice is literally only
concerned about Noah

11:25.940 --> 11:27.190
and his own come-up.

11:27.230 --> 11:29.420
This isn't what Carlotta
envisioned at all.

11:29.430 --> 11:30.900
If we get lost on
that small stage,

11:30.920 --> 11:33.060
our album gets lost, our
solo careers get lost.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.080
We gave up way too much
for this album to flop.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.920
Look, y'all done with
this pity party?

11:37.100 --> 11:38.950
Ain't nobody ever
gave Take 3 nothing,

11:38.980 --> 11:40.570
and ain't about to start now.

11:40.610 --> 11:42.310
If y'all want that
stage, then take it.

11:42.340 --> 11:43.519
Okay, but how do we do that?

11:43.520 --> 11:45.910
Bitch, I motivate, I don't strategize.
Figure it out.

11:45.950 --> 11:48.480
Alex, what about
your docuseries?

11:48.580 --> 11:51.750
No. I'm not doing
that anymore, so...

11:51.780 --> 11:54.650
Okay. Chloe.

11:54.690 --> 11:56.319
Hmm?

11:56.320 --> 11:58.560
She prides herself on
getting exclusives, right?

11:58.600 --> 12:01.080
So, we give her one before
Maurice gets a chance.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.299
We just got to drive
her attention to us.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.780
- Yup.
- Maybe by, like,

12:04.860 --> 12:06.680
a track that she can
break or something.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.659
Yeah, and if she gets the
audience hyped about us,

12:08.660 --> 12:10.850
Maurice has to give
us that main stage.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.690
- There she is.
- Act natural.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.920
Hey, Chloe? Can I holler
at you for a sec?

12:19.830 --> 12:22.480
Alex Crane.

12:22.820 --> 12:24.100
It's been a minute.

12:24.130 --> 12:27.260
Yeah, since my dad's Christmas
party a few years back.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.260
You know, I'm still
such a huge fan of his.

12:30.340 --> 12:31.980
When's <i> he</i> coming out
with new music?

12:32.020 --> 12:33.970
He's on a little
hiatus right now.

12:34.010 --> 12:35.740
But me and my girls
are in the studio.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.710
We'd love for you to come
in and take a listen.

12:37.750 --> 12:41.220
Maybe even drop an exclusive
on your site or something.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.100
Who knows?

12:43.820 --> 12:46.880
You girls get me
something hot, I'm in.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.930
Sorry about the "bitch" earlier.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.800
Maurice really brings
out the worst in me.

12:53.820 --> 12:55.060
- Just...
- Okay.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.400
How much longer do I have
to keep this from her?

12:57.430 --> 12:58.970
Look, we know the
Bankhead Crew is

12:59.000 --> 13:00.530
doing something
out of that club,

13:00.570 --> 13:02.080
and one of them hurt
your grandmother.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.340
Don't lose your focus.

13:03.370 --> 13:05.770
Well, can you tell me something?
You got any leads?

13:05.810 --> 13:09.360
This surface-level patrolling...
it isn't working anymore.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.520
I need to know the ins
and outs of that club

13:11.540 --> 13:13.240
before the brass shelves
the case on us.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.270
Then they shelve the case,

13:14.280 --> 13:15.760
and then what happens
to my grandma?

13:15.940 --> 13:17.820
I know how much
this means to you,

13:17.850 --> 13:20.820
so we got to work smart
and fast, all right?

13:20.860 --> 13:24.590
Find a way to get closer
to the action, okay?

13:26.460 --> 13:28.420
Okay.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.130
- Hey, yo, boss?
- Yeah.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.730
You needed to see me?

13:32.770 --> 13:35.940
I do. Look, we may have
a leak in the building,

13:35.970 --> 13:38.940
so I need you to find it and
plug it real quick, you got it?

13:38.970 --> 13:41.070
- Yeah. I got you.
- Cass?

13:41.110 --> 13:43.640
- Yo. Hey.
- Uh, did I catch you at a bad time?

13:43.680 --> 13:45.150
Nah. You know Mike-Mike.

13:45.180 --> 13:47.220
Bruh. I seen him around.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.540
Look, I just came to holla
at you about getting a job.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.650
Ah, we not hiring, Mr.
Neighborhood Watch. I'm sorry.

13:52.690 --> 13:54.696
Now, you know I wouldn't ask
if I didn't really need it,

13:54.720 --> 13:56.136
but we a little late
on the mortgage.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.100
I'm back on my feet now. I'm
just trying to pitch in

13:58.110 --> 13:59.960
- with Grandma.
- Mm-hmm.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.330
Yo, boss, we might need
some extra manpower

14:02.350 --> 14:03.360
in the storage.

14:03.370 --> 14:05.260
He look like he can
lift up a box or two.

14:06.370 --> 14:10.200
All right. Well, come on by
later, and we'll set you up.

14:10.220 --> 14:11.770
- Perfect.
- All right, later.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.560
Yo, Cass, you're not
gonna regret it, okay?

14:13.620 --> 14:15.240
I know. But, D,

14:15.280 --> 14:17.740
just know I'm doing this
for your granny, okay?

14:17.780 --> 14:20.460
What goes on in my
club stays in my club.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.200
I got you.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.220
Okay, look, we
need to figure out

14:28.260 --> 14:30.020
what it's going to
take to impress Chloe.

14:30.060 --> 14:32.090
All right, well,
what about this?

14:32.130 --> 14:33.460
Can you play it back?

14:40.540 --> 14:43.300
♪ You and me, you and me ♪

14:43.340 --> 14:46.560
♪ Can't you see, baby, I
got what you need, so ♪

14:46.620 --> 14:50.320
♪ Bet on me, bet on me... ♪

14:50.450 --> 14:52.180
That's all I got so far, but...

14:52.210 --> 14:53.880
All right.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.550
It's cool, but I feel like
it's more of the same.

14:57.590 --> 14:59.600
I feel like we need something
with more edge this time.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.060
We just did "Yellow Tape."
What do you mean, "more edge"?

15:02.090 --> 15:04.370
Yeah, but that was a diss track.
I mean, like, a real song.

15:04.390 --> 15:05.606
Don't you feel like
we've done this?

15:05.630 --> 15:06.900
So we need to go in a
different direction.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.230
These are the songs that
got us on the radio.

15:09.260 --> 15:11.600
These are the songs that got
us on Rhythm and Bells, so...

15:11.630 --> 15:13.219
Yeah, but people are
waiting on this.

15:13.220 --> 15:14.276
Let's give 'em something new.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.170
Okay, well, then
let's do a ballad.

15:16.210 --> 15:19.080
Never mind.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.410
Why are you getting so offended?

15:22.440 --> 15:23.760
- Come on, guys.
- All right.

15:23.780 --> 15:26.110
I feel like none of us are
really on the same page.

15:26.150 --> 15:27.910
- Nope.
- So, let's take a minute.

15:27.950 --> 15:29.670
I got an appointment to go to.
I'll be back.

15:30.690 --> 15:32.390
- Okay.
- Bye.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.100
Alex?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.360
Alex?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.440
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

15:41.530 --> 15:43.440
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

15:43.570 --> 15:46.570
Um... look, just take a five.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.840
I'm gonna keep working
on this track.

15:49.910 --> 15:52.170
Okay.

15:58.910 --> 16:01.110
People have been all over
my new music, all right?

16:01.150 --> 16:03.820
And-and my new stuff... it's
gonna be fire at the festival.

16:03.850 --> 16:05.860
But you still don't have a hit.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.379
You gonna deliver
at the festival?

16:07.380 --> 16:09.390
- Don't I always deliver?
- Not always.

16:09.430 --> 16:10.950
Once you left the Turn Up Tour

16:10.980 --> 16:13.060
for rehab, folks got to
wondering about you.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.799
People say you're
the comeback kid,

16:14.800 --> 16:16.229
but how many lives you got?

16:16.230 --> 16:19.220
Look, I'm-a deliver, all right?
Trust me.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.130
I'll let the people know.

16:21.170 --> 16:23.270
Yeah, you do that.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.540
Excuse me.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.520
So you just gonna ignore me?

16:29.610 --> 16:31.580
You haven't replied to my DMs.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.610
Who are you?

16:32.650 --> 16:35.350
I got to remind you about
the time on the tour?

16:35.380 --> 16:36.619
It was good, right?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.999
So good that you gave me

16:39.000 --> 16:40.199
- the damn clap.
- What?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.136
- And that's gonna cost your pretty ass.
- Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.779
I've never met you
a day in my life.

16:43.780 --> 16:45.990
Really?

16:47.880 --> 16:50.100
'Cause these photos
say otherwise.

16:50.130 --> 16:51.670
- Hey...
- Look,

16:51.700 --> 16:54.300
I need 20 thou by tomorrow,
or I'm going public.

16:56.070 --> 16:57.970
Oh, and by the way,

16:58.010 --> 17:00.610
your tongue skills
could use some work.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.300
Bad form.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.319
I swear on everything, I'm good,

17:13.319 --> 17:14.888
all right? I-I was wasted,

17:14.890 --> 17:17.220
but I got tested every three months.
She lying, man!

17:17.280 --> 17:19.160
Look, the truth
don't even matter.

17:19.190 --> 17:21.479
Once she goes public,
the brand is tarnished.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.849
Last thing we need two
months out of the R&B Fest.

17:23.859 --> 17:25.109
What is you talking
about right now?

17:25.130 --> 17:26.439
Just pay the bitch.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.020
No!

17:28.130 --> 17:29.680
This is extortion.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.600
As his lawyer, I say
that we call her bluff,

17:32.620 --> 17:33.980
get the authorities in on this.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.119
See, you sound like you
thinking as his woman,

17:38.120 --> 17:39.200
not his lawyer.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.910
Your little plan is gonna
make this a trending topic.

17:41.950 --> 17:44.110
And your boy buckles under pressure.
He's fragile.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.380
Stand up. I'll show you how
fragile I am right now.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.920
You know you don't
want this in your head

17:47.940 --> 17:49.920
while you're working
on your album.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.420
Noah, it's your call.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.760
If we pay her, she's just
gonna keep coming back.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.460
But whatever you decide,
I can make it work.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.720
I'm going with my
lawyer on this.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.780
Hi, baby.

18:18.820 --> 18:20.120
Hey.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.490
Oh, no. What could you
possibly be mad about now?

18:23.520 --> 18:26.920
I'm telling you, every
day it's something.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.099
We're trying to get this music
right for Carlotta's R&B Fest,

18:30.100 --> 18:32.159
and Alex is acting
like a super-producer

18:32.160 --> 18:33.830
who can't take input
from anybody,

18:33.870 --> 18:35.700
because her solo career
don't depend on this.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.130
It's practically her birthright.

18:37.170 --> 18:39.840
But for me, I'm all
this baby has.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.820
Why do you keep
saying it like that?

18:41.940 --> 18:43.670
Saying what like what?

18:43.710 --> 18:46.140
Saying it like it's all you
and I'm not a part of this.

18:46.180 --> 18:48.010
How did you get that
from what I just said?

18:48.050 --> 18:51.140
I don't understand you.
Are you listening at all?

18:51.250 --> 18:53.540
I am listening. Am I lying?

18:53.690 --> 18:54.899
You won't move in with me,

18:54.900 --> 18:56.520
and you never want
to talk about it.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.190
Yo, I'm not having this
conversation with you again.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.860
Like, I'm so done
with you, Star.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.740
Why can't you just acknowledge
that this is my baby, too?

19:07.400 --> 19:10.780
I will be at every single
doctor's appointment,

19:10.900 --> 19:14.440

I thought I'd be doing
something a little different.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.760
Bro, you got to sweat
to make cheese, man.

19:46.790 --> 19:47.800
Yeah, I know, man, but, look,

19:47.810 --> 19:49.220
I'm trying to help
my family out.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.180

19:51.210 --> 19:53.140

you're lying to me.

I've been with you

21:50.400 --> 21:52.060
I'm not lying. What are
you talking about?

21:52.100 --> 21:53.730
Your niece has been
to the police.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.330
You didn't think this was
something that I needed to know?

21:56.370 --> 21:59.640
No, because she went to the
police for a family problem.

21:59.670 --> 22:02.440
After she had already
been to our club.

22:02.470 --> 22:03.539
So?

22:03.540 --> 22:06.520
Now I got all this
pressure up in my head,

22:06.610 --> 22:08.680
and she may be the damn reason.

22:08.710 --> 22:10.310
Well, maybe you need
to go meditate,

22:10.350 --> 22:13.520
because Cotton has
nothing to do with this.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.800
Then who does, Cassie?

22:18.180 --> 22:21.630
You can trust me that I
have Cotton under control.

22:21.660 --> 22:24.600
Mm. I did.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.070
And you can see where
that's gotten us.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.430
No, babe. Look at me.

22:30.470 --> 22:32.740
I'm working hard for this.

22:32.770 --> 22:36.340

30:22.060 --> 30:23.830
Alex.

30:23.870 --> 30:26.540
Alex, please!

30:34.570 --> 30:36.599
Can you believe this mess?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.880
I can. I tried to warn you.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.320
Noah's still a boy.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.260
Maurice, please don't do this.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.580
Now is not the time.

30:43.650 --> 30:45.880
Then when?

30:45.960 --> 30:49.270
You can't even stand
to be around me.

30:50.460 --> 30:53.460
Every time I look at
you, I see our daughter.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.840
It's too painful.

30:55.910 --> 30:58.980
I need to move on, and
you need to let me.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.060
I understand.

31:09.100 --> 31:13.560
Look, my bad for
exploding like that.

31:13.590 --> 31:15.130
I realize I was
feeling triggered,

31:15.160 --> 31:17.980
and I'm still trying
to get control of it.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.420
It's okay.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.880
I think we need to prove
those photos are fake.

31:31.910 --> 31:33.700
How fast can you
set up with Chloe?

31:33.900 --> 31:36.060
Um...

31:36.920 --> 31:38.650
So, how much did she want?

31:38.680 --> 31:40.480
Man, she tried to extort me.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.566
All right? But thank God for
my lawyer, Megan Jetter.

31:42.590 --> 31:44.420
We got proof. I don't
even know the girl.

31:44.460 --> 31:45.560
Let me show you something.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.540
We found the original photo
on her social media.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.330
- Damn, I see it now.
- Yeah.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.136
You know what I mean? See,
but just like my mama

31:51.160 --> 31:53.070
would always say,
whatever's done in the dark

31:53.100 --> 31:55.220
will come to light, but I'm
not gonna press charges.

31:55.300 --> 31:56.570
No, I want to focus on my music.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.100
Hey, Alex, how'd it go?

31:58.140 --> 32:01.140
- Not now.
- What's wrong?

32:01.170 --> 32:03.410
I'm-I'm fine.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.710
Look, are you guys sure
you want to do this?

32:05.740 --> 32:08.340
Yeah, well, I think it's the
only way that we can go viral

32:08.380 --> 32:09.780
and get her attention.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.260
Let's go in there and
make it believable.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.966
- Okay.
- Show us those acting skills, sis.

32:13.990 --> 32:15.650
- Don't pressure me.
- Let's do it.

32:15.690 --> 32:18.580
Look, I really wish you would
stay in your damn lane

32:18.600 --> 32:19.880
and stick to the vocals!

32:19.900 --> 32:20.959
Oh, I would if I could,

32:20.960 --> 32:22.319
but I'm dealing with
a control freak

32:22.320 --> 32:24.176
who can't admit when the
songs aren't good enough.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.976
- They're not good enough.
- Are you kidding me?

32:26.000 --> 32:27.900
Why can't you just
leave her alone?

32:27.980 --> 32:30.076
Why is it that you can stick
up for Alex but you can never

32:30.100 --> 32:31.579
defend your own damn sister?

32:31.580 --> 32:33.516
- I'm tired of it.
- Maybe because you're a bitch.

32:33.540 --> 32:34.586
- Hey, hey.
- And you're not?

32:34.610 --> 32:35.870
Well, it's great taking advice

32:35.910 --> 32:38.010
from somebody who got
knocked up by a stranger.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.470
You push everybody away that
wants to be close to you.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.980
Noah.

32:42.010 --> 32:43.980
You know that real well, right?

32:44.020 --> 32:46.450
You know this whole situation
over here real well.

32:46.490 --> 32:48.700
You can't hold on to nobody.
You can't hold on to me,

32:48.720 --> 32:49.860
you can't hold on to Alex,

32:49.880 --> 32:51.640
and Jackson will soon
figure that out.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.420
Both of you are two
dysfunctional-ass bitches.

32:54.460 --> 32:56.380
I'm really glad that
this is our last album.

32:56.460 --> 32:58.076
Well, that's the first honest
thing you've said, ever.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.500
Oh, yeah?

32:59.530 --> 33:03.000
Are you... Are you
recording right now?

33:54.050 --> 33:55.460
What you mean, what the
hell I'm doing here?

33:55.470 --> 33:57.290
I said I was going to the gala.

33:57.320 --> 33:59.339
You said you was gonna
be by yourself.

33:59.340 --> 34:01.460
I know, I know. She decided
to come last second.

34:01.490 --> 34:02.500
I'm sorry.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.690
Do not make a scene.

34:05.780 --> 34:07.900
The Feds raided the club.

34:10.639 --> 34:12.370
What do they know?

34:12.400 --> 34:15.370
Nothing, 'cause I got out
before they could talk to me.

34:15.409 --> 34:17.418
And they're not gonna
have no evidence

34:17.420 --> 34:18.518
of no money laundering,

34:18.520 --> 34:20.310
because I'm not as
sloppy as you think.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.449
It's not just cash, Cas.

34:22.480 --> 34:25.449
I gave Mike-Mike
orders to go bigger.

34:26.300 --> 34:29.090
I've been running drugs all
up and down the coast.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.550
In my club?!

34:30.590 --> 34:33.219
You know what, I should blow
your brains out right in front

34:33.239 --> 34:35.830
- of your blonde bitch-ass wife.
- Cassie. Cassie. Shh.

34:35.860 --> 34:38.000
You told me it was gonna be

34:38.020 --> 34:39.900
a little money here
and there, and...

34:39.929 --> 34:41.330
You don't understand.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.440
You know how much going
legit meant to me.

34:43.460 --> 34:44.730
It meant everything to me.

34:44.770 --> 34:47.139
I know, and I am trying
to set things up for us.

34:47.170 --> 34:48.520
For you and me.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.340
For our life together so that
we would never have to worry.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.659
I reached out to my lawyer
today to file for divorce.

34:55.980 --> 34:58.350
I love you.

34:58.380 --> 35:01.050
I do.

35:01.090 --> 35:03.790
But they are going
to connect this

35:03.820 --> 35:05.940
to every business that
I have my hand in.

35:08.530 --> 35:12.700
Maybe... if you take the fall,

35:12.730 --> 35:14.160
- I can get you...
- What?!

35:34.540 --> 35:36.540
Hey.

35:36.610 --> 35:37.940
Why am I here?

35:37.980 --> 35:40.340
Show you my new place.

35:40.410 --> 35:42.320
There's plenty of room
for our kid, right?

35:42.370 --> 35:44.030
This is a joke.

35:44.070 --> 35:45.600
Good luck with everything.

35:45.670 --> 35:47.820
Jackson, I want you here, too.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.680
I want all three of
us here, together.

35:54.810 --> 35:57.010
I can't change the past.

35:57.050 --> 35:59.320
Or the fact that all of
this happened so fast

35:59.330 --> 36:02.020
and I don't know what I'm doing.

36:02.150 --> 36:04.640
But I can try and make sure
that the future's better.

36:04.790 --> 36:08.140
It's too late for that.

36:08.290 --> 36:10.190
Don't walk away from me.

36:10.230 --> 36:12.660
Like you've been doing
our entire relationship?

36:12.680 --> 36:15.300
I'm trying to talk to you now.

36:15.330 --> 36:17.200
Look, I don't know what
we're supposed to be,

36:17.230 --> 36:20.070
but I know that we are
this baby's parents.

36:20.100 --> 36:22.270
And I want this baby
to have a real family,

36:22.280 --> 36:25.410
a functioning family with
a mom and a dad like...

36:25.440 --> 36:27.960
Uncle Phil and Aunt
Viv or something.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.350
You know we'll never be
Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv.

36:30.380 --> 36:32.300
Of course we can't
be that great.

36:33.820 --> 36:35.060
But we can try.

36:42.030 --> 36:43.490
I don't know.

36:43.530 --> 36:46.900
I don't have much in
this house, but...

36:53.690 --> 36:55.790
This was your plan
the whole time.

36:55.820 --> 36:57.090
You remember your routine?

36:57.120 --> 36:59.160
I kinda forget; maybe
you can show me.

36:59.190 --> 37:01.590
- Me? Oh, I'm too big.
- Mm.

37:01.630 --> 37:04.700
- It's our song. It's gotta work.
- Ooh. Ooh.

37:04.730 --> 37:07.570
Easy now. Easy now.

Alex, before you say anything...

37:34.980 --> 37:36.280
So, your grandma told
me where you were

37:36.300 --> 37:38.246
and my dumb ass showed up
wanting to work things out.

37:38.270 --> 37:39.559
It's not what you're thinking.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.876
I think that we
got back together

37:40.900 --> 37:43.180
without talking about why
we broke up the first time.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.850
And I think that you're still
trying to give me payback

37:44.870 --> 37:45.899
for what happened with Noah.

37:45.900 --> 37:47.209
What are you talking about?

37:47.210 --> 37:49.056
Is she the reason why you've
been hanging at the club?

37:49.080 --> 37:51.420
- I can explain that.
- Then explain, Derek.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.450
Please explain.

37:55.950 --> 37:57.520
I can't right now.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.490
Right.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.120
You think I'm stupid.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.479
No. Baby...

38:03.480 --> 38:05.990
So go deal with your side
bitch, because I'm done.

38:07.290 --> 38:10.330
Alex, I love you
more than anything.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.770
You're lucky you're in the
clear, you know that?

38:16.800 --> 38:19.439
Trust me, I ain't never
been more relieved

38:19.440 --> 38:20.810
in my life.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.810
Oh, my gosh, wait till
this interview drops

38:22.840 --> 38:25.010
on these shady-ass bloggers.
So corny.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.679
They all gonna look stupid.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.810
- I can't wait, baby.
- Ah.

38:28.850 --> 38:30.980
Yeah.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.200
You should've given the bitch
the money when she told you.

38:33.220 --> 38:35.290
All right, all right.
W-Whatever you need, bro, I...

38:35.320 --> 38:36.320
Noah!

38:38.260 --> 38:39.689
Hey.

38:39.690 --> 38:41.520
Come on, man, come on,
d-don't hurt her, please.

38:41.540 --> 38:42.840
Please, what-whatever
it is, we-we can...

38:42.860 --> 38:44.830
Shut the hell up and
stay on the ground.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.060
Or I'll blow your head off.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.920
Alex.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.880
What's wrong?

39:05.890 --> 39:07.590
I was right.

39:10.220 --> 39:11.860
I'm so sorry.

39:11.890 --> 39:14.580
No, it's not your fault.

39:18.930 --> 39:20.930
Simone, why are you crying?

39:20.970 --> 39:23.400
I'm not crying, I just...

39:26.110 --> 39:29.310
I... I just feel like Derek.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.410
Wh-What are you talking about?

39:32.450 --> 39:36.220
Because of me...

39:36.250 --> 39:38.250
and Nina.

39:38.290 --> 39:41.020
You and Nina?

39:41.090 --> 39:43.760
We went viral.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.700
It worked.

39:46.940 --> 39:48.330
Look at this.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.019
Why is it that you can
stick up for Alex,

39:50.020 --> 39:51.919
but you can never defend
your own damn sister?

39:51.920 --> 39:53.880
- I'm tired of it.
- Maybe because you're a bitch.

39:53.900 --> 39:55.870
People love dirt, don't they?

39:55.900 --> 39:59.300
"These girls going out, ♪ epic."

39:59.340 --> 40:02.400

performance together.

♪ R&BFest."

40:04.780 --> 40:07.780
This is just what people
expect out of a girl group,

40:07.820 --> 40:09.410
because it happens all the time.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.180
People grow apart.

40:12.950 --> 40:15.650
They're calling it
our goodbye album.

40:15.690 --> 40:17.160
Y'all think it really is?

40:18.760 --> 40:20.490
Y'all were ready to break up.

40:20.530 --> 40:22.360
Only reason we're
sitting here right now

40:22.400 --> 40:24.060
is 'cause we were trying
to help Miss Carlotta,

40:24.080 --> 40:27.000
but we all got different
stuff we're trying to do.

40:27.060 --> 40:29.600
We're different artists
with different dreams.

40:29.640 --> 40:33.110
We did everything we said
we'd do when we got here.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.439
Well, not everything.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.510
We didn't win an ASA.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.240
But I think Star's right.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.640
Last album.

40:45.750 --> 40:47.659
Well, let's do it right.
