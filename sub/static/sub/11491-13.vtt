00:04.507 --> 00:07.596
Hey, you got anything special
going on next week?

00:07.773 --> 00:11.135
Well, let's see, next week.

00:11.305 --> 00:14.634
I like to keep Mondays free
for hangovers.

00:14.904 --> 00:18.301
Tuesday I was planning on
getting a haircut, mani-pedi and a facial.

00:18.469 --> 00:20.764
You know, guy stuff.

00:21.069 --> 00:23.534
Wednesday I have a meeting
with my business manager...

00:23.701 --> 00:25.530
...to discuss my retirement plan.

00:25.701 --> 00:30.927
And, as you know, Thursday and Friday
are kind of my me days.

00:31.498 --> 00:32.793
Why do you ask?

00:32.965 --> 00:34.760
Since I have a couple days off...

00:34.930 --> 00:37.794
...we could fly to Illinois
and visit my parents.

00:37.963 --> 00:39.690
Oh.

00:40.195 --> 00:43.422
I mean, you've only met my mother once
and you've never met my dad.

00:43.595 --> 00:44.617
That's true.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.453
I'd like him to get to know you
before the wedding.

00:47.626 --> 00:48.751
Of course.

00:48.926 --> 00:52.687
Although sometimes with parents,
I'm better served up as a surprise.

00:52.891 --> 00:56.448
- Don't be silly. He'll love you.
- And I'm sure I'll love him.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.521
So good, we'll fly out.

00:58.690 --> 01:00.917
Illinois, here we come.

01:01.088 --> 01:04.349
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

01:04.521 --> 01:06.782
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:14.318 --> 01:17.578
- Oh, darn it.
- What?

01:18.150 --> 01:21.342
I just remembered
I have an appointment next week.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.276
Doctor's appointment?

01:23.447 --> 01:26.106
Yes. Yes. A doctor's appointment.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.404
Is everything okay?

01:27.580 --> 01:31.511
Oh yeah, yeah, just a routine procedure
I've been putting off.

01:31.678 --> 01:33.439
What do you mean,
like a colonoscopy?

01:33.611 --> 01:36.508
Yes, exactly. A colonoscopy.

01:39.108 --> 01:40.835
Oh, Charlie, you can't put that off.

01:41.008 --> 01:43.439
No, no, no, I wanna meet your dad.

01:43.607 --> 01:46.300
I've been putting off
getting a colonoscopy for years.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.267
You're keeping that appointment.

01:48.439 --> 01:50.200
But what about meeting your dad?

01:50.371 --> 01:52.666
- We'll do it another time.
- Are you sure?

01:52.838 --> 01:55.133
Your health
is the most important thing.

01:55.304 --> 01:58.860
- I know how you procrastinate.
- I do, don't I?

01:59.036 --> 02:02.762
Boy, what would you do without me
to take care of you?

02:03.367 --> 02:08.627
Well, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be
getting a colonoscopy next week.

02:16.397 --> 02:20.225
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.622 --> 02:41.587
You're not gonna believe
what I just did.

03:12.977 --> 03:15.272
All right, let me see
if I've got this straight.

03:15.443 --> 03:18.806
In order to not spend time
with your fiancÃ©e's parents...

03:18.975 --> 03:22.804
...you're willing to let a doctor
snake a camera up your keister.

03:24.374 --> 03:27.770
I'd be willing to let them
shoot an IMAX feature...

03:29.005 --> 03:31.062
...but fortunately
it won't be necessary.

03:31.237 --> 03:32.964
- How do you figure?
- I have a plan.

03:33.137 --> 03:35.398
Oh, a plan.

03:35.936 --> 03:39.867
The day of the "procedure," you pretend
to drive me to the "hospital."

03:40.035 --> 03:42.330
- But we're not going to the hospital.
- Precisely.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.590
What we'll actually do
is go to the movies.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.789
Then we'll go out
for a couple of drinks...

03:46.965 --> 03:49.760
...so when I get home,
I'll be appropriately woozy.

03:49.931 --> 03:52.862
And I'll tell Chelsea that my colon
is clean as a whistle.

03:54.363 --> 03:57.920
You know, a whistle that you swallowed
then blew out your bung hole.

03:58.662 --> 04:00.025
Sure.

04:00.195 --> 04:03.489
And then she'll put me to bed,
I'll get some "Oh, poor Charlie" sex...

04:03.660 --> 04:06.125
...with her being ever mindful
of my tender area.

04:07.659 --> 04:10.283
Wow. This is a new low, even for you.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.718
Now, now, to be fair,
it's only a new low in this relationship.

04:13.890 --> 04:16.753
True, true. Can I pick the movie?

04:16.922 --> 04:18.683
- Fine.
- Do I get snacks?

04:19.954 --> 04:22.748
Yes, I'm paying for everything.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.681
Why do we continue
to play this game?

04:24.853 --> 04:28.409
- Because I still have my pride.
- No, you don't.

04:31.050 --> 04:32.380
Charlie, you okay?

04:32.550 --> 04:36.777
Yeah, I was just reminding Alan that he
has to take me in for my colonoscopy.

04:36.948 --> 04:39.539
Oh, that's not necessary. I'll take you.

04:40.415 --> 04:45.209
No, no, no, I don't want you wasting
your time off in a doctor's waiting room.

04:45.379 --> 04:48.276
Don't be ridiculous. I'm driving you.
Come back to bed.

04:54.143 --> 04:55.336
Good plan.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.696
No, no, no, you don't understand.

05:01.874 --> 05:05.169
I need a colonoscopy,
and it has to be next Wednesday.

05:09.271 --> 05:11.429
Yes, I'll hold.

05:13.070 --> 05:16.523
Can you believe it?
Their hold music is "Tunnel of Love."

05:16.702 --> 05:18.724
It's better than "Brown-Eyed Girl."

05:19.534 --> 05:21.829
Oh. God, I hope I can get an appointment.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.431
Maybe you should grease a few palms.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.895
If it was me,
I'd be greasing everything.

05:28.431 --> 05:31.521
Yeah, hi. Well, great, great.

05:31.697 --> 05:35.321
Wednesday, 8 a.m. Thank you,
thank you, you've made me very happy.

05:37.262 --> 05:40.556
Yeah, I imagine you don't hear that
too often.

05:41.094 --> 05:45.525
What? Yeah, fine, fine,
I won't eat on Tuesday.

05:45.959 --> 05:48.617
What do you mean,
"flush out my system"?

05:49.491 --> 05:51.423
Oh. Ick.

05:53.089 --> 05:57.020
All right, I'm
a little less happy now. Goodbye.

05:57.188 --> 05:59.312
You won't believe
what they want me to do.

05:59.488 --> 06:00.511
Taking laxatives...

06:00.687 --> 06:04.050
...and drinking a half gallon
of industrial strength Colonblow?

06:04.552 --> 06:08.483
Oh, right, you've done this before.
It seemed funnier then.

06:10.184 --> 06:13.637
I gotta tell you,
it seems pretty funny now.

06:14.049 --> 06:16.038
Why don't you just tell Chelsea
the truth?

06:16.216 --> 06:18.772
That I'd rather get violated
by a long metal tube...

06:18.948 --> 06:20.675
...than spend time with her folks?

06:20.847 --> 06:24.676
Somehow, I don't see her taking that
in the spirit in which it was intended.

06:25.212 --> 06:31.336
True, true. Well, I said it before,
and I think I need to say it again.

06:31.610 --> 06:32.700
Good plan.

06:39.507 --> 06:41.063
Why isn't Uncle Charlie eating?

06:41.240 --> 06:43.705
He has to fast
before he goes to the doctor tomorrow.

06:43.872 --> 06:46.269
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's getting a routine test.

06:46.438 --> 06:49.835
- They're taking a look at his intestines.
- How do they do that?

06:50.003 --> 06:53.059
Well, they take a tiny camera
and put it on the end of a tube...

06:53.236 --> 06:56.167
- Why don't we eat first?
- Good idea.

07:05.531 --> 07:07.497
Well, I'm happy to report...

07:07.665 --> 07:11.857
...I just saw a piece of Hubba Bubba
I swallowed in fifth grade.

07:12.730 --> 07:15.718
Oh, for God's sake, Charlie,
we're having dinner.

07:15.895 --> 07:17.292
Don't rub it in.

07:18.861 --> 07:21.019
Speaking of which,
I'm out of baby wipes.

07:21.893 --> 07:23.653
I bought you two boxes
of baby wipes.

07:23.826 --> 07:26.723
What can I tell you?
Babies don't crap like this.

07:30.423 --> 07:33.048
At least not healthy babies.

07:33.222 --> 07:35.211
There's a jar of aloe vera
under the sink.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.748
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Oh. Put a glob on your finger...

07:38.921 --> 07:40.352
Alan.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.780
- It's cooling and soothing.
- Well, good, good.

07:44.952 --> 07:48.474
Because let me tell you, you could roast
a marshmallow on my anus.

07:51.650 --> 07:54.137
You know what'd be good
for dessert?

07:54.315 --> 07:55.644
S'mores.

08:04.678 --> 08:06.109
How come I'm not loaded?

08:06.811 --> 08:09.140
They're supposed to get me loaded
before, right?

08:09.310 --> 08:12.605
Yes. They'll hook you up to an IV
right before the procedure.

08:12.775 --> 08:16.866
So we're on the same page, I wanna be
stone-cold out before anything goes in.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.165
I'll tell them.

08:18.973 --> 08:22.268
All I get is a glass of wine
and a "pretty please."

08:22.706 --> 08:25.466
- All right, we're ready.
- Did you bring the drugs with you?

08:25.638 --> 08:27.830
Oh, no, the anesthesiologist
takes care of that.

08:28.004 --> 08:29.469
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

08:29.637 --> 08:31.568
Since we couldn't make it to Illinois...

08:31.769 --> 08:34.563
...l'm flying my parents in to stay with us
for a week.

08:34.902 --> 08:36.162
What?

08:36.767 --> 08:39.857
Enjoy your colonoscopy,
you lying dirtbag.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.927
- You knew?
- I knew.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.958
I'll give you a thousand dollars
to push me to the parking lot.

08:53.729 --> 08:55.353
How are you feeling?

08:55.528 --> 08:58.391
Like a new fish at Leavenworth.

08:59.027 --> 09:02.219
Don't be so dramatic. Good news is
you have a clean bill of health.

09:02.392 --> 09:05.289
Yes, but I lost my water-tight seal.

09:06.124 --> 09:08.248
Yes, but you have peace of mind.

09:08.424 --> 09:11.015
Yes, but now I can't wear white
at our wedding.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.976
Yay, no polyps.

09:21.153 --> 09:22.345
Way to go, Uncle Charlie.

09:22.519 --> 09:24.417
Now you know how it feels.

09:26.017 --> 09:27.210
Thanks for calling ahead.

09:28.117 --> 09:30.775
- There's the happy couple.
- Welcome home.

09:30.949 --> 09:34.539
Charlie, you remember my mother,
Martha. And this is my father, Tom.

09:34.715 --> 09:37.010
- Good to see you again.
- You too.

09:37.180 --> 09:40.168
- Nice to finally meet you, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.312
Not much of a grip.

09:42.478 --> 09:45.069
But you're probably a little weak
from your anal probe.

09:49.543 --> 09:50.872
Didn't make me stronger.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.466
Isn't this great, Charlie?
Because you couldn't go see them...

09:55.641 --> 09:59.265
...Chelsea's folks dropped everything
to come spend time with you.

09:59.873 --> 10:04.270
- Yeah, it's great.
- Isn't it funny how plans work out?

10:06.271 --> 10:10.395
Hey, I found some steaks in the freezer.
Thought we'd have a little barbecue.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.159
He has to eat light for a while.

10:12.335 --> 10:16.232
Oh, please, he's been treated like a girl
enough today.

10:17.334 --> 10:18.356
He's not wrong.

10:19.733 --> 10:22.254
I'm never wrong
about what a man needs.

10:22.831 --> 10:26.422
Good golly, what's that fruity smell
coming from your head?

10:26.597 --> 10:28.028
It's an apricot conditioner.

10:28.196 --> 10:31.025
It keeps my hair from getting frizzy
with all the humidity.

10:31.195 --> 10:34.024
Oh, we need to get some meat
in you, pronto.

10:36.161 --> 10:39.683
Tom's always on guard
against the homosexual agenda.

10:41.992 --> 10:44.355
No offense.

10:50.223 --> 10:51.848
You're a great cook, Tom.

10:52.022 --> 10:55.385
Well, I always say
a man's gotta be self-sufficient.

10:55.554 --> 10:59.041
I agree. All I need is booze,
satellite TV and a housekeeper...

10:59.220 --> 11:01.980
...and I could survive in a cave.

11:02.451 --> 11:04.542
You know, if it were air conditioned.

11:05.184 --> 11:07.842
- I gotta ask you something, Charlie.
- Okay, I admit it.

11:08.017 --> 11:09.642
I slept with your daughter.

11:09.815 --> 11:11.974
But don't worry,
I'm still gonna marry her.

11:12.148 --> 11:13.307
Damn straight you are.

11:14.148 --> 11:15.806
Which brings me to my question.

11:15.980 --> 11:18.537
When a man's your age
and he's never married...

11:18.713 --> 11:20.371
...it's usually one of two reasons.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.669
- One...
- He's really lucky. Heh, heh.

11:24.044 --> 11:25.976
You're right, not funny, go on.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.507
What I'm trying to say is...

11:27.677 --> 11:31.732
...when a man gets to be 40 and he isn't
married, he's either a rascal or a poof.

11:32.508 --> 11:34.235
- Interesting.
- So?

11:34.408 --> 11:36.566
- So, what?
- So which one are you?

11:37.973 --> 11:41.369
- Uh, actually, there's a third choice.
- What's that?

11:41.538 --> 11:44.867
Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to meet his soul mate...

11:45.070 --> 11:47.661
...like I finally met your daughter.
- Soul mate?

11:47.837 --> 11:49.893
- Yep.
- So poof.

11:50.968 --> 11:52.991
Just kidding. Ha-ha-ha.

11:54.067 --> 11:57.499
- How are my two favorite fellas doing?
- We're just fine, princess.

11:57.666 --> 12:00.564
I cleaned the grill
and now I'm giving your beau a grilling.

12:00.732 --> 12:03.095
Stick a fork in me
because I think I'm done.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.957
Sorry, my dad's always been
a little overprotective.

12:06.130 --> 12:07.187
Well, I have to be.

12:07.363 --> 12:10.851
When it comes to men,
you've always had a rotten picker.

12:11.629 --> 12:13.617
No offense.
I'm sure you're the exception.

12:13.794 --> 12:15.656
I'm glad you're sure.

12:16.493 --> 12:19.050
- Why don't you see how Mom's doing?
- Oh. Good idea.

12:19.226 --> 12:23.952
She's jet-lagged and still pretty
wound up over having a colored pilot.

12:26.856 --> 12:27.981
What can I say?

12:28.156 --> 12:30.780
"Mommy and Daddy
are horrible bigots"?

12:31.221 --> 12:33.618
But they're my parents
and I gotta love them, right?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.218
You're asking the wrong guy.

12:36.620 --> 12:37.916
Look at them, though.

12:38.086 --> 12:41.210
Forty-two years together
and they're still best friends.

12:41.385 --> 12:44.475
Well, let's face it,
who else would have them?

12:44.651 --> 12:46.673
At least they don't lie to each other.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.012
Okay, I get it.
I lied about the colonoscopy.

12:50.182 --> 12:51.943
Trust me, I've been punished enough.

12:52.115 --> 12:55.012
If our marriage is gonna last,
we have to commit...

12:55.180 --> 12:57.043
...to always be honest with each other.

12:57.213 --> 12:58.371
You have my word.

12:58.546 --> 13:00.273
You've given me your word before.

13:00.445 --> 13:04.036
Well, then, you'd be silly to take it again,
wouldn't you? Ha, ha.

13:04.876 --> 13:06.671
What? I'm being honest.

13:07.643 --> 13:10.073
So how are you liking Los Angeles?

13:10.242 --> 13:12.208
Well, the weather's lovely.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.635
Oh, it is, isn't it?

13:13.807 --> 13:18.295
What we don't care for
are the freeways and Mexicans.

13:19.606 --> 13:21.798
Yeah, yeah, they do get congested.

13:21.972 --> 13:25.164
I think it's all the cheese
they cook with.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.166
How's everybody getting along
out here?

13:32.335 --> 13:33.960
Everything's fine, dear.

13:34.133 --> 13:37.962
Remember what we talked about.
No politics, religion or what have you.

13:38.132 --> 13:42.324
You don't have to tell me twice.
I'm not a Polack.

13:45.563 --> 13:49.221
Hey, Charlie, when we drove in,
I noticed a tavern down the road.

13:49.395 --> 13:52.985
How about you and I go out for a drink?
Get to know each other a little better.

13:53.161 --> 13:56.320
Uh, sure, I guess. Although
if you're on the fence about me now...

13:56.526 --> 13:58.923
...alcohol isn't gonna really improve
my chances.

13:59.592 --> 14:01.887
I think it's a terrific idea.
You boys have fun.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.955
All right. I'm buying.

14:08.889 --> 14:09.945
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:10.121 --> 14:13.280
- Where are you going?
- He said he's buying.

14:16.719 --> 14:21.207
Who would've thought the best part of
my day would be having a colonoscopy?

14:25.383 --> 14:28.177
To my future son-in-law.
Down the hatch.

14:28.349 --> 14:30.973
Considering my day,
it'd be more like up the hatch.

14:32.347 --> 14:33.778
Cheers.

14:36.246 --> 14:39.405
So, Alan,
Chelsea tells me you're a chiropractor.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.567
I imagine you give a great back rub.

14:41.744 --> 14:44.073
Uh, I do,
but there's a lot more involved than that.

14:44.243 --> 14:46.765
I like back rubs.

14:47.043 --> 14:49.065
But I need strong hands on me.

14:49.242 --> 14:52.968
Martha's got these little parrot claws,
can't get deep in the muscle.

14:53.141 --> 14:55.106
Let me see what you go.

14:55.273 --> 15:00.169
Oh. No calluses.
I prefer the feel of calluses.

15:01.404 --> 15:04.336
If you wanna see calluses,
check the inside of his right palm.

15:07.635 --> 15:11.225
Look at that.
You don't see that where I come from.

15:11.401 --> 15:13.923
Oh, come on, heh, there's no gay people
where you live?

15:14.099 --> 15:16.758
Of course there are,
but they got their own bar.

15:16.933 --> 15:21.886
Little place called The Log Cabin. On
Forrester Street. Right next to the A&W.

15:27.828 --> 15:31.486
Amazing that people in California
can behave that way in public.

15:31.661 --> 15:34.922
- We kind of believe in "live and let live."
- Oh, that's baloney.

15:35.092 --> 15:40.318
I believe in the sanctity of the family,
marriage between a man and a woman.

15:42.157 --> 15:45.247
But damn, those fellas do look happy.

15:45.423 --> 15:48.546
Probably because in California
they can't get married.

15:50.754 --> 15:53.413
Really, really happy.

16:01.417 --> 16:04.870
- I know what that is.
Down the hatch.

16:05.349 --> 16:09.041
Looks like my future father-in-law
has made some new friends.

16:09.215 --> 16:10.975
Yeah. I'm a little confused.

16:11.147 --> 16:12.578
<i>Do you really want...</i>

16:12.747 --> 16:15.610
I don't think you're the only one.

16:15.779 --> 16:20.005
<i>Do you really wanna make me cry?</i>

16:20.178 --> 16:21.973
Whoa, I love that song.

16:22.143 --> 16:25.869
I hit it out of the park
on karaoke night at the VFW.

16:26.042 --> 16:28.030
Chelsea didn't tell me you're a vet.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.003
Yeah, Navy. Submarine Corps.

16:31.174 --> 16:34.230
Ohh... Six-month tours
under the polar icecap.

16:34.406 --> 16:36.769
Nothing to do but lift weights,
shoot the bull...

16:36.972 --> 16:38.800
...and enjoy the company
of other men.

16:38.971 --> 16:41.561
- Six months with just men?
- Not just men.

16:41.737 --> 16:44.134
Young men. Hard men.

16:46.569 --> 16:51.192
And the hardest of them all was
Edward Boynton, Seaman Third Class.

16:51.367 --> 16:52.889
And my best pal.

16:54.766 --> 16:57.560
1966. We were in the Philippines
for a week of R&R...

16:57.732 --> 16:59.560
...and we bought matching shirts.

17:00.098 --> 17:01.926
Of course you did.

17:03.696 --> 17:07.990
I remember one night,
it was real hot and humid.

17:08.162 --> 17:13.023
I can still see the wet silk
clinging to his magnificent body.

17:14.592 --> 17:16.784
- Did you see this coming?
- Unh-unh.

17:17.590 --> 17:21.045
Then after we did our hitch,
we both went our separate ways...

17:21.223 --> 17:22.654
...got married, raised kids.

17:22.823 --> 17:25.583
We exchange Christmas cards
and family photos every year.

17:25.755 --> 17:30.448
Terrific. Great, great.
Okay. Why don't we drink up and go home?

17:31.320 --> 17:32.910
He's still in great shape.

17:33.086 --> 17:36.210
Sixty-five years old
and solid as a rock.

17:36.385 --> 17:37.873
He lives in Valencia.

17:38.051 --> 17:39.913
Hey, how far is that from here?

17:40.084 --> 17:42.106
Not so far.
Right next to Magic Mountain.

17:42.283 --> 17:45.112
It's far, Alan. Real far.

17:45.282 --> 17:47.180
Right, right, it's far.

17:47.348 --> 17:49.177
Let's get you home
to your lovely wife.

17:49.348 --> 17:52.245
She means well,
but she doesn't understand me.

17:52.746 --> 17:56.075
Well, you're obviously
a complicated man.

17:57.044 --> 17:58.805
Come on, we got a big day tomorrow.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.341
Universal Studios,
then Grauman's Chinese Theater.

18:01.510 --> 18:03.237
I wanna go to Valencia.

18:03.409 --> 18:07.999
- We'll pencil it in. See if we have time.
- I wanna go now. I wanna see Ed.

18:08.508 --> 18:11.961
Yeah, but Ed is probably asleep.
You know, with his wife.

18:12.140 --> 18:14.003
- Wanna know a secret?
- No, that's okay.

18:14.172 --> 18:16.501
Don't ask, don't tell.
That's our philosophy.

18:16.671 --> 18:22.431
<i>I brought my silk shirt and a VHS copy
of Ice Station Zebra just in case. But shh!</i>

18:24.136 --> 18:27.226
You know who was great in that movie?
Rock Hudson.

18:27.435 --> 18:28.957
Shut up.

18:37.798 --> 18:40.025
You guys have fun?

18:40.197 --> 18:41.855
Oh, yeah.

18:43.395 --> 18:47.520
- My dad's really something, isn't he?
- Uh-huh.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.850
Kind of a man's man.

18:50.026 --> 18:52.151
You could say that.

18:52.326 --> 18:55.189
I'm telling you, Martha,
I can't live this lie anymore.

18:55.358 --> 18:58.153
You're drunk. Now come to bed.
No.

18:58.324 --> 18:59.914
It's a bed of lies.

19:00.090 --> 19:02.748
I love Edward Boynton
and he loves me.

19:03.856 --> 19:06.548
- What the hell is happening?
- I don't know.

19:06.721 --> 19:10.311
But I have a feeling your dad's
going to Magic Mountain tomorrow.

19:22.249 --> 19:24.771
- Hey.
- You get your mom on the plane okay?

19:24.949 --> 19:27.470
- Yeah.
- How's she doing?

19:27.981 --> 19:29.378
Pretty shook up.

19:29.546 --> 19:34.409
It's not every day your husband tells you
he's leaving you for a 65-year-old man.

19:35.512 --> 19:37.976
What bothers her more?
That her marriage is over...

19:38.144 --> 19:42.336
...or that her ex-husband is now
promoting the homosexual agenda.

19:43.175 --> 19:44.640
I'm not in the mood, Charlie.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.830
- You took my dad to the hotel?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:48.007 --> 19:50.631
And I met this Edward Boynton
he's been talking about.

19:50.806 --> 19:52.896
- Nice guy.
- Oh, yeah?

19:53.072 --> 19:54.901
Black guy.

19:58.537 --> 20:02.093
- Really?
- Can I be the one to tell your mom?

20:04.268 --> 20:05.325
I'm gonna go lay down.

20:06.835 --> 20:08.959
- Hey, Chels?
- What?

20:09.400 --> 20:12.661
Given everything that's gone down
with your dad, I'm off the hook...

20:12.833 --> 20:16.093
...on the whole "lying to you
about the colonoscopy" thing, right?

20:16.264 --> 20:17.752
Right.

20:20.963 --> 20:24.450
Isn't it nice when things work out?
