HIM TO THE RISK OF A VACCINE.

08:19.333 --> 08:23.335
YEAH, WE WERE LUCKY...

08:23.337 --> 08:25.504

WHEN WE'RE IN VEGAS.

WE WANT TO ROLL THE DICE

08:28.008 --> 08:30.008

08:30.010 --> 08:31.843
OKAY.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.179
WHAT, SO YOU'RE SUDDENLY
PRO-VACCINE?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.681

WITH ME IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.183
YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

BUT WHEN YOU GUYS WERE GONE,
I HAD TIME TO DO SOME READING,

08:40.187 --> 08:41.486
AND --
OH, FIRST OF ALL,

08:41.488 --> 08:43.321
I FINALLY FINISHED
"THE GOLDFINCH."

08:43.323 --> 08:44.656
SO GOOD.

08:44.658 --> 08:48.660
BUT [SIGHS] I ALSO READ UP
ON CHILDHOOD INOCULATIONS,

08:48.662 --> 08:50.829
AND IT SAYS THERE'S SOME RISK
FOR BABIES,

08:50.831 --> 08:53.031
BUT BOYD CAN GET
HIS SHOTS NOW SO...

08:53.033 --> 08:55.333
BUT I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.003

08:58.005 --> 08:59.838

TOTALLY BEEN AVOIDED.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.973

I HAD TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS.

TO SECOND-GUESS ME NOW.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.419

SOME CLOTHES FOR BOYD AND GO.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.354
ALL RIGHT, I'LL COME WITH YOU.
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.223

GIVE IT A COUPLE MORE DAYS.

FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

BOYD'S NOT CONTAGIOUS.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.071
HI, MIKE BAXTER HERE
FOR OUTDOOR MAN

09:33.073 --> 09:34.573
WITH A MESSAGE FOR THOSE OF YOU

09:34.575 --> 09:37.075
WHO ARE WAGING A WAR
AGAINST VACCINATIONS.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.743
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THAT WAR.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.247
YOU SEE, VACCINATIONS ACTUALLY
WON THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.083
SEE, AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS
A BIG OUTBREAK OF SMALLPOX,

09:45.085 --> 09:47.419
NOT TO BE CONFUSED
WITH THE "GREAT POX,"

09:47.421 --> 09:49.921
WHICH IS WHAT THEY CALLED,
UH, SYPHILIS.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.757
THAT LED TO THE POPULAR
18th-CENTURY PICKUP LINE,

09:52.759 --> 09:56.461
"COME ON, BABY,
IT'S ONLY SMALLPOX."

09:56.463 --> 10:00.131
ANYHOO, BRITISH SOLDIERS HAD
A NATURAL IMMUNITY TO SMALLPOX,

10:00.133 --> 10:02.467
SO IN AN EARLY VERSION
OF BIOLOGICAL WARFARE,

10:02.469 --> 10:04.803
THEY WOULD INTENTIONALLY SPREAD
THE DISEASE TO OUR COLONISTS

10:04.805 --> 10:08.640
BY SNEEZING IN PUBLIC
OR BORROWING OUR ChapStick.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.975
BUT WE HAD OUR OWN
SECRET WEAPON --

10:09.977 --> 10:11.309
GEORGE WASHINGTON.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.410
HE WOULD INOCULATE THE TROOPS

10:12.412 --> 10:14.746
USING A TECHNIQUE
CALLED "VARIOLATION."

10:14.748 --> 10:16.247
IF YOU'RE EATING RIGHT NOW,

10:16.249 --> 10:18.583
I SUGGEST YOU PUT DOWN
THAT FORK,

10:18.585 --> 10:20.285

IS WHERE YOU POKE

10:20.287 --> 10:21.987

INFECTED BLISTERS

10:21.989 --> 10:24.823

UNDER YOUR OWN HEALTHY SKIN.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.325
THIS LED TO THE POPULAR

10:27.327 --> 10:30.662
"THIS CENTURY IS GROSS."

10:30.664 --> 10:31.896
BUT IT WORKED.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.566
THE SMALLPOX RATES PLUMMETED.
WE WON THE WAR.

10:34.568 --> 10:37.068
SO, YOU SEE,
IF IT WASN'T FOR VACCINATIONS,

10:37.070 --> 10:39.070
WE WOULD HAVE LOST THE WAR,
WE'D ALL BE BRITISH,

10:39.072 --> 10:41.906
FOOTBALL WOULD BE SOCCER,
WE'D BE EATING BANGERS, MASH,

10:41.908 --> 10:43.875

WOULD BE A DESSERT.
