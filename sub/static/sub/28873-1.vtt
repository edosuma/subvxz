00:57.083 --> 01:00.718
Who the fuck has been using
my straightening iron again?!

01:00.720 --> 01:02.319
Here we
go again, fucking drama queen.

01:02.321 --> 01:04.491
I told you to stop
using my shit, Aleisha!

01:06.226 --> 01:08.593
Nobody wants to use your
cheep dollar store flat iron.

01:08.595 --> 01:09.727
Whatever trick!

01:09.729 --> 01:11.064
Hey,
you're Lena, right?

01:12.465 --> 01:14.064
Uh huh.

01:14.066 --> 01:16.468
So Kami told me you sold
her some good scripts.

01:16.470 --> 01:17.337
Is that true?

01:19.139 --> 01:20.107
Are you a junkie?

01:21.140 --> 01:21.975
Are you serious?

01:23.309 --> 01:24.575
Yeah, you know,
like a drug addict.

01:24.577 --> 01:26.745
Do I look like
a drug addict to you?

01:26.747 --> 01:29.046
No offense but kind of.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.581
I'm just asking
you for some help.

01:30.583 --> 01:31.451
That's it.

01:33.152 --> 01:34.020
Fair enough.

01:35.521 --> 01:36.754
All right.

01:36.756 --> 01:38.757
Don't ever use
the product's name

01:38.759 --> 01:42.227
and if I get wind that you
told anybody where you got it,

01:42.229 --> 01:44.629
I cut you off and we
don't know each other.

01:44.631 --> 01:45.763
Okay, I got it.

01:45.765 --> 01:46.932
50 up front,

01:46.934 --> 01:48.599
leave the rest in there when
I make the drop tomorrow.

01:48.601 --> 01:49.601
Okay?

02:17.496 --> 02:19.532
Hey, watch the bar for me.

02:46.425 --> 02:48.725
Hey, did you guys see Lena?

02:48.727 --> 02:50.227
I ain't seen her.

02:50.229 --> 02:51.097
Really?

02:53.100 --> 02:55.001
I'm glad to see you
guys are on it, thanks.

05:53.879 --> 05:55.780
Just be cool.

05:55.782 --> 05:57.251
Okay, after you.

06:01.354 --> 06:02.453
Just go in.

06:02.455 --> 06:03.888
Just do some studying
tonight, okay?

06:03.890 --> 06:04.892
That's all I wanna
do, just study.

06:08.294 --> 06:09.626
After you.

06:12.631 --> 06:13.831
Jesus Christ!

06:13.833 --> 06:15.501
What the fuck are
you doing here?

06:16.636 --> 06:17.568
Don't worry.

06:17.570 --> 06:18.770
I was just on my way out.

06:18.772 --> 06:20.371
What the hell,
Ben, who is that?

06:20.373 --> 06:21.242
Um.

06:21.975 --> 06:23.340
You need to leave.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.811
I do not want to call the cops.

06:27.047 --> 06:28.616
How old is this one?

06:31.051 --> 06:32.586
You coulda
called, you know?

06:33.520 --> 06:34.451
I do call.

06:34.453 --> 06:35.686
You don't answer.

06:35.688 --> 06:37.888
Yeah, well, you
know how it is.

06:37.890 --> 06:38.790
Yeah.

06:38.792 --> 06:39.760
I know how it is.

06:42.561 --> 06:45.265
Well, I guess I'll
just leave you to it.

06:46.499 --> 06:47.665
That's it?

06:47.667 --> 06:49.369
You're not gonna put up a fight?

06:50.070 --> 06:50.938
Nope.

06:53.405 --> 06:54.571
What's this?

06:54.573 --> 06:55.708
It's all in there.

06:59.912 --> 07:01.414
Have fun with Malibu Barbie.

07:12.424 --> 07:13.359
You okay?

07:14.994 --> 07:15.863
Yeah.

07:17.397 --> 07:18.065
What's wrong?

07:25.104 --> 07:26.773
Nothing is wrong.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.477
That was romantic.

07:34.780 --> 07:35.648
I'm sorry.

07:39.986 --> 07:43.153
Come on, you know
I'm just kidding.

07:43.155 --> 07:44.991
I know you have a
lot on your mind.

07:48.094 --> 07:50.694
I'll go make the coffee.

07:50.696 --> 07:51.564
Okay.

09:00.466 --> 09:01.131
Thank you.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.002
Careful.

09:05.071 --> 09:06.840
So what time are
you meeting me?

09:08.807 --> 09:10.607
Yeah, about that.

09:10.609 --> 09:12.008
Um.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.109
Unbelievable.

09:13.111 --> 09:14.045
You forgot, didn't you?

09:14.047 --> 09:15.913
No, I didn't forget.

09:15.915 --> 09:17.881
I just didn't get
the time off yet

09:17.883 --> 09:19.049
Are you serious?

09:19.051 --> 09:21.084
You just wait till
today to bring this up?

09:21.086 --> 09:22.285
Well, if you would've
reminded me last night...

09:22.287 --> 09:25.522
No, no, no, no, you are not
turning this around on me.

09:25.524 --> 09:26.491
You just told me the other day

09:26.493 --> 09:28.092
that you were getting
your shift covered.

09:28.094 --> 09:29.260
All right, I know, okay?

09:29.262 --> 09:31.094
But the new guy is
a real fucking prick

09:31.096 --> 09:33.097
and especially with all the
cutbacks going on right now,

09:33.099 --> 09:35.699
I didn't wanna get on
anybody's shit list.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.102
Just remind him, I
mean, what's the problem?

09:38.104 --> 09:39.904
I doesn't work like that.

09:39.906 --> 09:40.905
We need the overtime.

09:40.907 --> 09:41.809
You know that.

09:42.941 --> 09:43.811
Great.

09:45.045 --> 09:47.178
I'll just go by myself because
that won't be embarrassing.

09:47.180 --> 09:48.779
Oh, hey, come on.

09:48.781 --> 09:50.714
Don't overreact.

09:50.716 --> 09:51.716
We'll reschedule it.

09:51.718 --> 09:52.949
It'll be fine.

09:52.951 --> 09:54.251
I bet I can get the
time off next week.

09:54.253 --> 09:56.087
I don't get you.

09:56.089 --> 09:58.021
You were just saying how
important this is to you

09:58.023 --> 10:00.891
and now you act like
it's not a big deal.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.760
I mean, what am I
supposed to think, Jared?

10:02.762 --> 10:05.695
I don't know, what
do you want me to say?!

10:05.697 --> 10:06.997
Plus, I already
changed my schedule

10:06.999 --> 10:08.100
so I'm closing tonight.

10:10.936 --> 10:12.071
Just don't go.

10:13.806 --> 10:16.806
What, you hate that
job anyway, right?

10:16.808 --> 10:18.208
You've been talking about
quitting for months.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.077
You're being an asshole.

10:20.079 --> 10:21.011
I'm being an asshole?

10:21.013 --> 10:22.112
Yeah, you're being an asshole.

10:22.114 --> 10:23.613
Why because I'm just repeating

10:23.615 --> 10:24.881
what you've been telling me?

10:24.883 --> 10:25.750
Huh?

10:25.752 --> 10:26.950
Or am I crazy now?

10:26.952 --> 10:29.554
No, I'm the one that's crazy.

10:29.556 --> 10:30.755
I really must be.

10:30.757 --> 10:33.823
I mean, all we do is argue
and I'm sick and tired of it.

10:33.825 --> 10:36.126
Come on, we're
figure this out.

10:36.128 --> 10:37.563
No, you'll figure it out.

10:40.233 --> 10:41.732
Sara!

11:52.205 --> 11:53.270
Morning.

11:53.272 --> 11:55.072
I think you mean afternoon.

11:55.074 --> 11:58.242
Yeah, I woke up like 20
minutes ago, so it's morning.

11:58.244 --> 11:59.343
You're late again.

11:59.345 --> 12:00.276
So?

12:00.278 --> 12:01.779
What're you, gonna nark on me?

12:01.781 --> 12:02.947
Kevin's really pissed.

12:02.949 --> 12:04.115
Shit.

12:04.117 --> 12:05.216
I'm gonna have to
listen to him give his

12:05.218 --> 12:07.284
gay little punctuality
speech again.

12:07.286 --> 12:08.386
That's real mature.

12:09.989 --> 12:11.921
Are you gonna help me here
or just text on your phone?

12:11.923 --> 12:13.991
Oh my God, you are so mean.

12:13.993 --> 12:15.959
Calm down for a second.

12:15.961 --> 12:17.127
Rough night?

12:17.129 --> 12:18.064
Yeah, kinda.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.799
Okay, what has been
going on between you two?

12:22.801 --> 12:25.803
He's just acting like a
little bitch, that's all.

12:25.805 --> 12:26.871
What did you do?

12:26.873 --> 12:27.972
Nothing, I swear.

12:27.974 --> 12:29.406
I know, I know.

12:29.408 --> 12:31.644
He was wasted, I doubt
he even remembers.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.145
Here he comes.

12:34.147 --> 12:35.146
Hi, Peter.

12:35.148 --> 12:36.016
Fuck you, Greg.

12:59.172 --> 13:00.139
Hey, Rick.

13:01.306 --> 13:02.973
Hey, can I talk to
you for a second?

13:02.975 --> 13:04.909
As long as it doesn't
cut into my lunch hour.

13:04.911 --> 13:06.946
Last week I put in
a request for leave.

13:08.314 --> 13:09.814
I just never heard back
if it was approved or not.

13:09.816 --> 13:11.415
Did you talk to
Monica? She's HR, not me.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.321
Yeah, she said she was just
waiting for your sign off, so.

13:15.721 --> 13:17.822
You know we have a
deadline here, right?

13:17.824 --> 13:19.056
Yeah, I'm fully...

13:19.058 --> 13:20.056
And you also know we'll be
handing out a lot of overtime

13:20.058 --> 13:21.193
in the next six months.

13:22.327 --> 13:23.294
Since you're having
personal problems,

13:23.296 --> 13:24.995
I suppose I can take
you off the OT roster.

13:24.997 --> 13:26.362
No, no,

13:26.364 --> 13:27.868
I didn't mean it like that.

13:29.134 --> 13:30.003
Hey.

13:31.403 --> 13:33.939
Hey, man, I just need a
couple hours off early.

13:34.840 --> 13:35.709
Two.

13:37.210 --> 13:39.075
I'll give you an hour.

13:39.077 --> 13:40.346
Take it or leave it.

14:05.271 --> 14:06.873
I thought I'd find you here.

14:10.075 --> 14:10.944
A little busy.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.846
Yeah, you look swamped.

14:15.882 --> 14:17.982
Why can you never
make an appointment?

14:17.984 --> 14:19.085
Why would I do that?

14:21.052 --> 14:22.520
I did some digging.

14:22.522 --> 14:24.889
This case, it's pretty similar.

14:24.891 --> 14:25.759
Check it out.

14:32.064 --> 14:33.264
It's Michigan State.

14:33.266 --> 14:34.134
So?

14:35.134 --> 14:37.535
It's a different state
set in different laws.

14:37.537 --> 14:39.272
Plus, we already
lost your appeal.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.039
Well,

14:42.041 --> 14:43.240
can't we take it higher

14:43.242 --> 14:44.809
or can't you make a
case for reinstatement

14:44.811 --> 14:45.745
like this guy did?

14:47.180 --> 14:48.181
You could.

14:50.383 --> 14:51.852
Wouldn't matter.

14:57.455 --> 14:59.823
What're you saying,
I should give up?

14:59.825 --> 15:01.357
I didn't say that.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.560
They got some
serious dirt on you.

15:03.562 --> 15:04.428
Come on.

15:04.430 --> 15:05.465
You know I didn't cheat.

15:06.832 --> 15:07.497
Whatever.

15:07.499 --> 15:08.368
Semantics.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.968
Look, I hate what
that guy did to you,

15:11.970 --> 15:12.703
but you've got to look at this

15:12.705 --> 15:15.072
from a purely legal standpoint.

15:15.074 --> 15:17.477
So I guess the law doesn't
care about the truth.

15:19.845 --> 15:21.447
Lena, it's not like
you lost everything.

15:27.586 --> 15:30.187
Listen, I'll call you if I
hear anything about the appeal.

15:30.189 --> 15:31.525
In the meantime,

15:32.591 --> 15:34.059
try to stay out of trouble.

15:36.128 --> 15:36.997
See you.

15:52.277 --> 15:53.477
I'm sorry.

15:53.479 --> 15:54.347
Yeah.

15:56.047 --> 15:57.180
Thanks for cleaning up.

15:57.182 --> 15:58.147
All right.

15:58.149 --> 15:59.516
During your last visit,

15:59.518 --> 16:03.219
you described having symptoms
of irregular bleeding

16:03.221 --> 16:06.357
and menstrual cramps outside
of your menstrual cycle.

16:06.359 --> 16:07.227
Mhmm.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.493
We did find some
cysts on your cervix

16:10.495 --> 16:12.128
that we'd like to
know more about.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.098
So something is wrong?

16:14.100 --> 16:16.132
Well, most of the time
when we get results like this

16:16.134 --> 16:18.569
it's for something
completely benign.

16:18.571 --> 16:22.106
However, I would like to
schedule an appointment next week

16:22.108 --> 16:24.007
so that I can take
a closer look.

16:24.009 --> 16:26.142
Then we find some answers?

16:26.144 --> 16:28.279
Well, it's the
best place to start.

16:28.281 --> 16:31.117
The biopsy will give us a
more in depth explanation.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.984
What if it comes back
as something serious?

16:34.986 --> 16:37.453
The good thing is
that you came in early

16:37.455 --> 16:39.158
and the cysts are very small.

16:41.527 --> 16:43.430
Well what're we supposed
to do in the meantime?

17:08.521 --> 17:10.118
Hey, Lena.

17:10.121 --> 17:10.990
Come on back.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.329
Who's the kid?

17:19.330 --> 17:20.696
My nephew.

17:20.699 --> 17:23.133
Katie's having
me watch him for the day.

17:23.135 --> 17:24.001
He's cute.

17:24.002 --> 17:24.936
You sure you're related?

17:30.609 --> 17:32.209
All new product here.

17:32.211 --> 17:33.609
Mostly homegrown hydro.

17:33.611 --> 17:36.280
Very clean, very
high quality strands

17:36.282 --> 17:38.749
and some real choice terpenes.

17:38.751 --> 17:42.187
Now, if you wanna talk about
a real step up in quality.

17:47.292 --> 17:48.492
So what am I looking at?

17:48.494 --> 17:51.462
I just sell the stuff, I
don't come up with the names.

17:51.464 --> 17:53.129
How much?

17:53.131 --> 17:56.099
Retail on the Lobster
is 400 an ounce.

17:56.101 --> 17:58.001
But, as always, you
get friend prices,

17:58.003 --> 17:59.472
so 350.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.473
Fuck, are you serious?

18:02.475 --> 18:05.078
Supply and demand's
a real bitch these days.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.479
Go ahead, free sample.

18:08.481 --> 18:09.950
No, I gotta work.

18:11.082 --> 18:12.217
Suit yourself.

18:14.020 --> 18:16.220
All right, give me it all.

18:16.222 --> 18:17.387
Which one?

18:17.389 --> 18:19.455
The stupid Red Lobster
shit or whatever.

18:19.457 --> 18:21.791
If it goes fast, I'll
come back for more.

18:21.793 --> 18:23.330
You'll definitely be back.

18:25.031 --> 18:26.166
Gotta love strippers.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.066
Sure you can't stay?

18:29.068 --> 18:31.738
I just scored the Raiders
trilogy on laserdisc.

18:32.638 --> 18:34.238
Nah, I can't tonight, man.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.505
Rain-check though, yeah?

18:35.507 --> 18:37.109
You don't know
what you're missing.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.580
Hey, aren't you worried about
your nephew smelling that?

18:45.251 --> 18:46.152
Problem solved.

18:58.330 --> 18:59.262
Hey.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.297
Boss lady wants to see you.

19:00.299 --> 19:01.365
About what?

19:01.367 --> 19:03.103
What do you think?

19:13.212 --> 19:15.378
No, you listen to me, Antonio.

19:15.380 --> 19:16.512
Do you know how long

19:16.514 --> 19:17.780
I've been doing business
with your family?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.652
You tell your father I want a
discount on the next shipment.

19:21.553 --> 19:22.554
Grazie, Ciao.

19:24.557 --> 19:26.322
So what's up?

19:26.324 --> 19:28.559
John John said you
wanted to see me.

19:28.561 --> 19:30.362
I don't know, you tell me.

19:32.298 --> 19:36.165
Okay, look, I'm going to
cut you a little break.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.469
I know you're new around here
so you haven't had a chance

19:38.471 --> 19:40.671
to see how I do things.

19:40.673 --> 19:42.306
I don't know what
you mean by that.

19:42.308 --> 19:44.174
Come on, Lena, cut the crap.

19:44.176 --> 19:46.109
Just so you know,

19:46.111 --> 19:49.579
I've been hustling longer
than you've been in a bra.

19:49.581 --> 19:52.148
I gave you this job because
you gave me the impression

19:52.150 --> 19:53.416
that you were smart.

19:53.418 --> 19:54.684
Now I feel like, I don't know,

19:54.686 --> 19:57.654
you're going out of your way
to prove me wrong or something.

19:57.656 --> 19:59.623
It's not the worst thing
going on around here.

19:59.625 --> 20:02.725
What you girls do on your
own time, that's your business,

20:02.727 --> 20:04.694
but when you bring
it into my house,

20:04.696 --> 20:06.532
then it becomes my business.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.133
You feel me?

20:09.135 --> 20:10.302
Yeah, I feel you.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.138
Good.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.607
Now go out there, earn a living.

20:39.564 --> 20:40.432
Hey.

20:42.901 --> 20:44.837
Yeah, I know, I
got your messages.

20:48.607 --> 20:50.343
I'm actually a little
busy right now.

20:52.711 --> 20:53.780
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:07.826 --> 21:08.828
You missed a spot.

21:15.533 --> 21:16.401
Hey.

21:18.971 --> 21:21.538
What's gotten into you?

21:21.540 --> 21:22.475
Doctor's orders.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.822
You gonna get that?

21:38.256 --> 21:39.225
It's Rick.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.960
Fuck.

21:42.962 --> 21:44.164
He wants me to go in.

21:45.531 --> 21:46.597
It's fine, go ahead.

21:46.599 --> 21:47.567
Look, hey.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.404
How about we pick this
up when I get home, huh?

21:52.670 --> 21:53.572
That's romantic.

21:54.540 --> 21:55.973
What makes you think
I'm gonna be in the mood

21:55.975 --> 21:57.374
at four in the morning?

21:57.376 --> 21:58.375
What makes you think
I was gonna wake you

21:58.377 --> 21:59.242
at four in the morning?

21:59.244 --> 22:00.543
Oh, God.

22:00.545 --> 22:01.411
Hey.

22:01.413 --> 22:03.012
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:03.014 --> 22:04.748
I was kidding.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.252
Yeah, that's the problem.

22:07.953 --> 22:09.386
What is that supposed to mean?

22:09.388 --> 22:10.423
It means...

22:12.023 --> 22:14.457
Fuck, I don't know
what it means.

22:14.459 --> 22:15.925
Babe.

22:15.927 --> 22:17.860
Hey, hey.

22:17.862 --> 22:19.396
Relax.

22:19.398 --> 22:21.330
All right, we have a plan.

22:21.332 --> 22:22.467
We're sticking to that.

22:23.435 --> 22:24.835
Yeah, I know, we had a plan.

22:24.837 --> 22:27.436
I just feel like everything
keeps getting in the way.

22:27.438 --> 22:28.739
Like what?

22:28.741 --> 22:30.874
- I don't know.
- Hello!

22:32.645 --> 22:35.479
You've gotta get
that fucking key back.

22:35.481 --> 22:37.817
I'm sorry, am I
interrupting something?

22:38.751 --> 22:39.616
Greg.

22:39.618 --> 22:40.485
Hi, Jarrod.

22:43.755 --> 22:45.355
Is everything okay?

22:45.357 --> 22:46.826
Yeah, it's just
a stupid thing.

22:48.359 --> 22:49.925
Okay, well, I know what you're
gonna say, so don't bother.

22:49.927 --> 22:51.494
And I'm willing
to ignore the fact

22:51.496 --> 22:53.432
that you've been screening
my texts all day.

22:54.399 --> 22:55.699
What're you doing here?

22:55.701 --> 22:56.966
Okay, I don't know
what's going on with you

22:56.968 --> 22:58.534
and I honestly
couldn't care less,

22:58.536 --> 22:59.669
but you need to hurry
up and get ready

22:59.671 --> 23:01.440
because you're
coming out tonight.

23:02.373 --> 23:03.773
No, it's bad timing.

23:03.775 --> 23:05.876
Yeah, preciously why I'm here.

23:05.878 --> 23:08.444
You need to go change because
you look like a poor person.

23:08.446 --> 23:09.879
Look around, I
am a poor person.

23:09.881 --> 23:12.484
Yes but that doesn't mean
you have to look like one.

23:13.551 --> 23:15.551
Okay, you're not blind, right?

23:15.553 --> 23:18.055
Means you could see
what was just going on?

23:18.057 --> 23:19.926
I'm really not in
the mood to go out.

23:22.628 --> 23:25.494
Oh my, you're not gonna go
away if I say no, are you?

23:25.496 --> 23:26.365
Probably not.

23:28.399 --> 23:29.765
Fine, I'll go.

23:29.767 --> 23:31.401
Girl, that's my girl!

23:31.403 --> 23:32.536
Let me just do the dishes.

23:32.538 --> 23:33.936
Mind if I knosh real quick?

23:33.938 --> 23:36.408
Yeah, that's fine, just
don't eat Jarrod's Kung Pao.

23:38.976 --> 23:39.909
Wait, a brewery?

23:39.911 --> 23:41.177
Yes, a brewery.

23:41.179 --> 23:43.646
Come on, remember we talked
about being open to new places?

23:43.648 --> 23:44.915
Yeah but...

23:44.917 --> 23:46.849
Well this is new places. Come
on, don't be such a square.

23:46.851 --> 23:48.452
Fine, fine, fine.

23:48.454 --> 23:49.685
Dress like a poor person,
drink like a poor person.

24:10.743 --> 24:12.675
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

24:12.677 --> 24:14.711
Greg, this is, um.

24:14.713 --> 24:15.846
Yeah.

24:15.848 --> 24:17.079
What was your name again?

24:17.081 --> 24:19.383
I'm sorry, she's
a little excited.

24:19.385 --> 24:20.684
It's her first week as a woman.

24:20.686 --> 24:22.051
Literally just having surgery.

24:22.053 --> 24:23.720
Snip, snip.

24:23.722 --> 24:25.755
Come on, I'm getting
drunk tonight.

24:53.918 --> 24:56.787
How many times did
you see that light go off?

24:56.789 --> 24:58.687
Just answer me, how many times?

24:58.689 --> 25:00.123
You know how it is.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.192
If these niggers don't come,
I don't get tipped for shit.

25:02.194 --> 25:03.793
That's not my problem.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.061
When you see that light, you
need to be off their laps

25:06.063 --> 25:08.667
unless they pay for another
dance upfront, got it?

25:09.967 --> 25:12.404
This is a dance club,
not a fucking brothel.

25:28.587 --> 25:31.454
He saved a little squirrel.

25:31.456 --> 25:32.822
Okay.

25:32.824 --> 25:33.790
Come on.

25:33.792 --> 25:35.192
Can I sit right here?

25:35.194 --> 25:36.926
- Okay.
- Let's go to this car.

25:36.928 --> 25:37.927
No, that's not our car.

25:37.929 --> 25:38.994
- That's not our car.
- Look.

25:38.996 --> 25:39.930
This is our.

25:39.932 --> 25:41.030
No, that's not our car.

25:41.032 --> 25:42.531
This is our car.

25:42.533 --> 25:43.767
This is not.

25:43.769 --> 25:44.734
No, no, no.

25:44.736 --> 25:46.069
Come on, it's
good for just a second.

25:46.071 --> 25:47.169
Oh, God.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.038
I'm gonna
lay right here.

25:48.040 --> 25:48.938
Please don't.

25:48.940 --> 25:49.806
Oh, you please don't.

25:49.808 --> 25:50.874
You please don't.

25:50.876 --> 25:52.509
Stop.

25:52.511 --> 25:53.909
Don't don't be so angry.

25:53.911 --> 25:56.680
Two seconds, two seconds.

25:56.682 --> 25:57.550
Can you please?

25:58.216 --> 26:00.549
Two seconds, just let me stay.

26:00.551 --> 26:01.917
Come on, come on.

26:01.919 --> 26:03.086
Don't touch me.

26:03.088 --> 26:04.954
Can you
believe that bitch?

26:04.956 --> 26:06.825
Hey, come on.

26:11.696 --> 26:12.761
Hey!

26:12.763 --> 26:13.762
Wake up!

26:13.764 --> 26:15.499
Let's go, in the car.

26:15.501 --> 26:16.566
Come on.

26:16.568 --> 26:17.267
We gotta go.

26:17.269 --> 26:18.268
Don't touch me.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.903
Hey, you guys okay?

26:19.905 --> 26:21.171
She is drunk.

26:21.173 --> 26:22.271
It sounds like he's drunk.

26:22.273 --> 26:23.839
She is.

26:23.841 --> 26:25.274
- You need some help?
- Get on in there.

26:25.276 --> 26:26.643
Oh, you guys, thanks.

26:26.645 --> 26:28.744
- Put your feet in.
- Thanks, guys.

26:28.746 --> 26:31.181
- A little bit farther.
- Can I drive?

26:34.086 --> 26:35.085
Thanks for your help.

26:35.087 --> 26:36.252
Oh, no problem.

26:36.254 --> 26:38.254
Do you need a
ride or something?

26:38.256 --> 26:40.223
No, I'm just right
down the street.

26:40.225 --> 26:43.026
Come on, it's the least I
can do. You helped me out.

26:43.028 --> 26:44.594
No, I'm good.

26:44.596 --> 26:45.962
Okay, thanks again.

26:45.964 --> 26:48.598
You might wanna
crack a window.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.265
Good idea.

27:25.137 --> 27:28.203
You coulda called if
you were gonna be this late.

27:28.205 --> 27:30.607
I'm sorry, I
lost track of time.

27:30.609 --> 27:31.907
Yeah, those new smartphones

27:31.909 --> 27:33.612
do everything but
tell time, huh?

27:36.581 --> 27:37.713
So what's new?

27:37.715 --> 27:39.249
Quite a lot, actually.

27:39.251 --> 27:40.783
Hospital's building a new wing

27:40.785 --> 27:43.819
and they want me to head
up the new Post-Op Unit.

27:43.821 --> 27:44.988
Look at you.

27:44.990 --> 27:48.058
I could keep you up-to-date
if you were around more.

27:48.060 --> 27:50.193
I'm just keeping busy,
you know how it goes.

27:50.195 --> 27:51.060
Yeah.

27:51.062 --> 27:52.063
Yeah, I do.

27:53.331 --> 27:54.196
More coffee, y'all?

27:54.198 --> 27:55.632
I'm good. Thanks.

27:55.634 --> 27:56.332
What
can I get for you?

27:56.334 --> 27:57.701
Oh, I'm good, thanks.

27:57.703 --> 27:58.902
You sure?

27:58.904 --> 27:59.802
Stick around, have
something to eat.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.303
I'm not hungry.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.239
Indulge your old man.

28:24.128 --> 28:26.930
I told you I don't need it.

28:26.932 --> 28:28.697
Most people say thanks
when they're handed

28:28.699 --> 28:30.068
an envelope full of cash.

28:31.903 --> 28:34.104
I make more than
that in a weekend.

28:34.106 --> 28:35.838
But where does it go?

28:35.840 --> 28:36.975
What're you trying to say?

28:38.877 --> 28:41.110
I've got a lot of
connections in this town.

28:41.112 --> 28:42.912
Why don't you let me
talk to a few people?

28:42.914 --> 28:44.748
Call in some favors.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.348
Story of my life.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.952
You always pulling
strings for me.

28:48.954 --> 28:50.856
If I didn't do it,
who the hell will?

28:53.859 --> 28:55.058
If I take your money,

28:55.060 --> 28:56.861
you promise never to
bring this up again?

28:59.363 --> 29:00.231
Deal.

29:07.805 --> 29:09.138
Well,

29:09.140 --> 29:10.973
thanks for the pep talk.

29:10.975 --> 29:12.308
I'm probably
wasting my breath,

29:12.310 --> 29:15.412
but you know Victoria would
like you to come over.

29:15.414 --> 29:17.012
She wants to cook for you.

29:17.014 --> 29:19.849
I doubt I'd make
for good company.

29:20.284 --> 29:21.219
That's not fair.

29:22.888 --> 29:24.753
I'm just being honest.

29:24.755 --> 29:26.155
Great.

29:26.157 --> 29:29.259
You finally decided to
be honest just to dis me.

29:29.261 --> 29:31.330
Oh, come on, who's
being dramatic now?

29:32.430 --> 29:33.298
You know,

29:34.198 --> 29:35.801
for what it's worth, Lena,

29:37.069 --> 29:39.171
I did the best I could
to do right by you.

29:40.171 --> 29:41.306
See you around, sweetheart.

29:55.186 --> 29:56.088
Hey, hon.

29:57.054 --> 29:58.421
Hey.

29:58.423 --> 29:59.355
What?

29:59.357 --> 30:00.757
We saved some this month.

30:00.759 --> 30:01.457
Oh yeah?

30:01.459 --> 30:02.325
Yeah.

30:02.327 --> 30:03.195
Nice.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.463
Why don't we do
something fun tonight?

30:06.465 --> 30:08.667
You know I start
going in early tonight.

30:09.367 --> 30:10.336
Right, right.

30:11.936 --> 30:12.838
But I'd love to.

30:14.805 --> 30:16.074
I know, I know.

30:20.846 --> 30:23.715
I'm gonna go
jump in the shower.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.373
Hello?

30:50.375 --> 30:51.844
Gorgeous,
what're you doing?

30:54.111 --> 30:56.378
Just hanging out.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.446
Why?

30:57.448 --> 30:59.017
Great, I'm coming over.

30:59.984 --> 31:00.849
Wait.

31:00.851 --> 31:01.720
What?

31:02.853 --> 31:04.419
Why you coming over?

31:04.421 --> 31:05.390
What time is it?

31:07.024 --> 31:08.023
I'll brief
you in person.

31:08.025 --> 31:09.992
Just make sure you're
ready when I get there.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.860
No, hold on, what're
you talking about?

31:13.031 --> 31:13.930
You're breaking.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.132
I'll see you soon.

31:16.134 --> 31:17.200
Greg.

31:17.202 --> 31:18.334
Greg, hello?

31:20.338 --> 31:22.004
Damn it.

31:25.042 --> 31:26.509
Okay, enough with the secrecy.

31:26.511 --> 31:27.876
Where are we going?

31:27.878 --> 31:29.078
All right,
you know that girl

31:29.080 --> 31:30.078
that like saved our
lives the other night?

31:30.080 --> 31:31.181
Yeah.

31:31.183 --> 31:32.348
Well it's been
driving me freaking nuts

31:32.350 --> 31:33.950
trying to remember
where I know her from.

31:33.952 --> 31:35.385
I'm surprised you remember
anything from that night.

31:35.387 --> 31:36.485
Oh wow, you're funny.

31:36.487 --> 31:38.087
Shut up, I'm telling a story.

31:38.089 --> 31:40.857
So last night I'm at Mecca
hanging with my girl J-Rock

31:40.859 --> 31:42.224
and then, boom, I see her.

31:42.226 --> 31:44.194
Turns out she works their too.

31:44.196 --> 31:46.296
Awesome, what does
that have to do with me?

31:46.298 --> 31:47.530
Oh, so we get to talking.

31:47.532 --> 31:49.365
It turns out we know a
lot of the same people

31:49.367 --> 31:50.899
and she said that if
we come in tonight,

31:50.901 --> 31:52.434
she'll get us comped at the bar.

31:52.436 --> 31:54.570
Seriously, that's
what you wanted to do?

31:54.572 --> 31:55.905
Go drinking?

31:55.907 --> 31:57.272
Yeah, listen, we'll
go for one drink

31:57.274 --> 31:58.473
and then we can
bounce, I promise.

31:58.475 --> 31:59.908
I already told
her we'd be there,

31:59.910 --> 32:01.144
so do not make me
look like a flake.

32:01.146 --> 32:02.412
They say you only
get two chances

32:02.414 --> 32:03.512
to make a first impression.

32:03.514 --> 32:04.379
They don't say that.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.949
I think they say that.

32:05.951 --> 32:07.850
Pretty sure it's one
and you already blew that.

32:07.852 --> 32:08.520
Please?

32:09.620 --> 32:11.320
God, I really
hate you sometimes.

32:11.322 --> 32:13.322
Yeah but the rest of
the time, you love me.

32:13.324 --> 32:15.058
Okay, where is this place?

32:15.060 --> 32:16.960
I never heard of it.

32:16.962 --> 32:18.528
It's a surprise.

32:38.282 --> 32:39.249
Are you for real?

32:39.251 --> 32:40.450
Oh, come on, relax.

32:40.452 --> 32:41.917
Act like you've
seen tits before.

32:41.919 --> 32:42.921
Hey, baby.

32:43.655 --> 32:45.120
Hi.

32:56.234 --> 32:57.302
Here you go.

33:00.504 --> 33:02.571
Your friend looks out of it.

33:02.573 --> 33:04.307
First time?

33:04.309 --> 33:05.540
Is it that obvious?

33:05.542 --> 33:06.909
What do you think?

33:06.911 --> 33:08.144
Should she fill
out an application?

33:08.146 --> 33:09.646
She what she's working
with under the jacket.

33:09.648 --> 33:10.680
Take it off.

33:10.682 --> 33:12.115
Stay.

33:12.117 --> 33:15.184
Just relax and enjoy
the show, sweetheart.

33:15.186 --> 33:16.985
Speaking of shows, I'm up next

33:16.987 --> 33:18.288
so I'll come back and
check on you guys later.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.255
All right, kill it.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.630
Hey, this place is cool, right?

33:27.197 --> 33:28.130
Where's the bathroom?

33:28.132 --> 33:28.998
Oh my God, go.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.002
I'll go get us drinks.

33:57.696 --> 34:00.029
Hey, everything come out okay?

34:00.031 --> 34:01.163
This is Steven?

34:01.165 --> 34:04.067
- This is my other half, Steven.
- Heard a lot about you.

34:04.069 --> 34:06.069
Only the good
stuff, I promise.

34:06.071 --> 34:06.938
Sure.

34:08.505 --> 34:09.438
Ready?

34:09.440 --> 34:10.505
- Yes.
- Cheers.

34:21.185 --> 34:22.654
You guys lost again?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.721
Guys, this is Lena.

34:24.723 --> 34:26.255
Lena, Sara, Steven.

34:26.257 --> 34:27.255
- Hi.
- Hey.

34:27.257 --> 34:29.525
By the way, you look
fucking hot up there.

34:29.527 --> 34:31.360
Well, thank you.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.328
So what's going on?

34:32.330 --> 34:33.529
It looks like you're leaving.

34:33.531 --> 34:35.732
Yeah, we have a little bit
of a situation to deal with.

34:35.734 --> 34:36.733
She's drunk.

34:36.735 --> 34:37.867
He's bring nice. I'm
making him take me home.

34:37.869 --> 34:40.536
Well, at least he's
standing on his own two feet.

34:40.538 --> 34:42.538
Wow, all right, all right.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.271
We're gonna bounce.

34:43.273 --> 34:45.007
Are you going to Chivo's thing?

34:45.009 --> 34:46.610
I'm not sure,
are you guys going?

34:47.478 --> 34:48.777
Yes, we are going.

34:48.779 --> 34:50.112
Let's make it a foursome.

34:50.114 --> 34:51.114
Okay, see you there.

34:51.116 --> 34:52.047
All right.

34:52.049 --> 34:52.715
It's nice seeing you.

34:52.717 --> 34:55.083
You too.

35:04.561 --> 35:05.431
Jesus.

35:07.165 --> 35:08.500
Where you been?

35:09.701 --> 35:12.134
I just stepped out with Greg.

35:12.136 --> 35:13.138
Lost track of time.

35:14.505 --> 35:16.806
I hope he had less than you.

35:16.808 --> 35:18.373
I just had a few drinks.

35:18.375 --> 35:19.775
Wait, wait, wait,
why're you home?

35:19.777 --> 35:21.210
Is everything okay?

35:21.212 --> 35:22.779
Yeah, they had a
delay on material,

35:22.781 --> 35:24.049
so they cut us early.

35:26.384 --> 35:28.116
You could've text me.

35:28.118 --> 35:29.317
Well my phone died.

35:29.319 --> 35:31.253
Didn't think I was
gonna be out this late.

35:31.255 --> 35:33.489
And Greg's phone was dead too?

35:38.429 --> 35:40.264
Is there anything
else you wanna tell me?

35:42.132 --> 35:44.766
Why are you acting like this?

35:44.768 --> 35:46.335
Well I get a little worried

35:46.337 --> 35:49.641
when I come home to an empty
house and missing wife.

35:51.275 --> 35:53.409
Sorry, warden, your right.

35:53.411 --> 35:54.346
Shoulda told you.

35:55.313 --> 35:57.246
Is that all or can I
go back to my cell now?

35:57.248 --> 35:58.550
I didn't mean it that way.

36:01.652 --> 36:02.553
Fine, I'm sorry.

36:03.788 --> 36:05.721
Can we just drop
it and go to bed?

36:05.723 --> 36:06.755
Fine.

36:06.757 --> 36:07.625
Fine.

36:28.580 --> 36:29.744
Yeah, well couples fight.

36:29.746 --> 36:31.183
Comes with the territory.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.315
Yeah but this was different.

36:33.317 --> 36:35.451
Well maybe he's
just being insecure.

36:35.453 --> 36:38.454
It's like he finally sees that
you can have fun without him.

36:38.456 --> 36:39.654
I guess.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.491
Isn't his birthday coming up?

36:41.493 --> 36:43.192
Yeah, next week, why?

36:43.194 --> 36:44.460
I don't know, maybe you
invite him out with you.

36:44.462 --> 36:46.762
Show him that he has
nothing to worry about.

36:46.764 --> 36:49.532
We just have a lot
going on right now.

36:49.534 --> 36:51.199
I don't even know what
to get him this year.

36:51.201 --> 36:52.367
Maybe it's not
something you get him.

36:52.369 --> 36:54.737
Maybe it's something
you give him.

36:54.739 --> 36:56.873
Look, I don't claim to be
an expert on relationships.

36:56.875 --> 36:57.840
Agreed?

36:57.842 --> 36:58.840
At least monogamous ones.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.476
But, and don't get mad
at me for saying this,

37:01.478 --> 37:04.279
just seems like there's
something, I don't know,

37:04.281 --> 37:06.250
a little bit off
about you guys lately.

37:07.886 --> 37:10.418
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know, I don't know.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.753
Never mind, forget
I said anything.

37:11.755 --> 37:13.221
No, no, you can't do that.

37:13.223 --> 37:14.158
Spit it out.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.791
Look, I love Jarrod.

37:16.793 --> 37:18.194
I think he's a great guy

37:18.196 --> 37:19.462
and I know that you
care about him a lot.

37:19.464 --> 37:20.630
I used to look at you two

37:20.632 --> 37:23.366
and think that I want
something like that in my life.

37:23.368 --> 37:25.467
We're far from
perfect, Greggy.

37:25.469 --> 37:27.570
Like I said, I'm no expert.

37:27.572 --> 37:30.505
I just don't like seeing
you all torn up about it.

37:30.507 --> 37:31.509
I appreciate that.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.309
All right, switching gears.

37:34.311 --> 37:35.244
Are you coming?

37:35.246 --> 37:36.445
The beach thing.

37:36.447 --> 37:37.445
No, I doubt it.

37:37.447 --> 37:38.581
Oh, come on, what else
do you have going on?

37:38.583 --> 37:39.748
I won't know anybody.

37:39.750 --> 37:40.882
You'll know me

37:40.884 --> 37:43.186
and Steven and Lena's
gonna be there.

37:43.188 --> 37:44.554
Come on, please,

37:44.556 --> 37:45.554
I swear I won't leave
your side the entire time.

37:45.556 --> 37:46.655
Please?

37:46.657 --> 37:47.793
Come on, please, please.

37:49.194 --> 37:50.358
I kinda like it when you beg.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.893
Okay, yeah, well
don't get used to it.

37:51.895 --> 37:52.763
Come on.

37:58.603 --> 38:00.268
Something smells good.

38:00.270 --> 38:01.670
Damn right it does.

38:01.672 --> 38:02.804
Hope you're hungry.

38:02.806 --> 38:04.542
Starving actually.

38:05.677 --> 38:06.675
How'd you get home?

38:06.677 --> 38:08.543
Greggy gave me a ride.

38:08.545 --> 38:09.645
I would've picked you up.

38:09.647 --> 38:11.313
It's fine.

38:11.315 --> 38:12.848
We're on the same shift.

38:12.850 --> 38:13.882
You all right?

38:13.884 --> 38:14.852
Just exhausted.

38:19.757 --> 38:20.755
Hey,

38:20.757 --> 38:21.692
the clinic called.

38:24.596 --> 38:26.431
They want to schedule
another appointment.

38:27.565 --> 38:30.366
I don't wanna think
about that right now.

38:30.368 --> 38:31.904
Well, I've got
some other news.

38:32.869 --> 38:34.473
We picked up another contract.

38:35.706 --> 38:36.871
Hey, that's great.

38:36.873 --> 38:38.373
Yeah, it's only
temporary at first.

38:38.375 --> 38:39.644
So we'll see how it goes.

38:40.578 --> 38:41.446
That's good.

38:42.980 --> 38:44.913
So I'm not gonna be around
the next couple of weeks much.

38:44.915 --> 38:46.450
You gonna be all
right with that?

38:47.317 --> 38:48.250
I don't know.

38:48.252 --> 38:51.387
I mean, how could I possibly?

38:51.389 --> 38:52.822
The world's just so scary

38:52.824 --> 38:55.327
without my big man
to take care of me.

38:58.462 --> 38:59.362
Well you could cash
in that rain check

38:59.364 --> 39:00.862
from the other night.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.599
I can't tonight.

39:04.601 --> 39:07.205
I kinda have to go to this
work thing with Greggy.

39:08.339 --> 39:09.304
I'm sorry.

39:09.306 --> 39:10.905
I mean, I don't have to go.

39:10.907 --> 39:12.741
No, it's fine, go.

39:12.743 --> 39:13.611
Have a good time.

39:16.047 --> 39:16.915
Are you sure?

39:17.915 --> 39:19.348
Yeah.

39:19.350 --> 39:21.284
Just don't have a great time

39:21.286 --> 39:22.985
or I'll take it personally.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.828
I swear to God, the dog
is stealing my boyfriend.

39:32.830 --> 39:34.896
Are you gonna take
my playboy home?

39:34.898 --> 39:37.666
They're making
out and everything.

39:51.315 --> 39:51.980
Boo!

39:51.982 --> 39:53.782
- Hey!
- Hey!

39:53.784 --> 39:54.650
Mind if I sit?

39:54.652 --> 39:55.920
Oh, sure, go ahead.

40:01.025 --> 40:01.991
No thanks, I'm good.

40:01.993 --> 40:03.925
It's not tobacco.

40:03.927 --> 40:05.494
I figured that.

40:05.496 --> 40:06.431
Just saying.

40:11.868 --> 40:13.001
So you went to ODU?

40:13.003 --> 40:14.070
Huh?

40:14.072 --> 40:15.770
Greg told me you went there.

40:15.772 --> 40:16.807
Oh, yeah, I did.

40:17.875 --> 40:19.407
I was planning on going there.

40:19.409 --> 40:20.342
You were?

40:20.344 --> 40:21.009
Mhmm.

40:21.011 --> 40:22.344
Why didn't you go?

40:22.346 --> 40:24.413
Well it was between
going to college

40:24.415 --> 40:25.815
or starting a life with Jarrod,

40:25.817 --> 40:26.952
so I choose that one.

40:33.824 --> 40:34.690
When did you graduate?

40:34.692 --> 40:35.661
I didn't.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.562
But it's a long story, so.

40:40.498 --> 40:41.700
I'm not going anywhere.

40:46.371 --> 40:48.971
You sure you don't
want any of this?

40:48.973 --> 40:49.938
What the hell?

40:49.940 --> 40:50.806
Yeah?

40:50.808 --> 40:51.773
Yeah, why not?

40:51.775 --> 40:52.710
- All right.
- Okay.

40:54.545 --> 40:55.811
All right, so I'm nervous.

40:55.813 --> 40:57.079
You'll be fine.

40:57.081 --> 40:58.480
So you're gonna suck
kinda hard, okay?

40:58.482 --> 40:59.350
Okay.

41:00.650 --> 41:02.150
Keep going.

41:02.152 --> 41:03.020
Yep.

41:07.859 --> 41:08.824
I don't think
I did that right.

41:08.826 --> 41:09.925
No, you did it just fine.

41:09.927 --> 41:11.059
- Trust me, the coughing helps.
- Well, well, well.

41:11.061 --> 41:12.628
What're you two doing over here?

41:12.630 --> 41:13.862
Nothing.

41:13.864 --> 41:16.599
Um, holy shit, Sara,
are you smoking weed?

41:16.601 --> 41:17.500
Like a champ.

41:17.502 --> 41:18.601
I have to
capture this moment.

41:18.603 --> 41:19.768
No, don't.

41:19.770 --> 41:20.902
- Yes.
- Come on, are you crazy?

41:20.904 --> 41:21.837
Oh, shut up, I'm
not gonna post it,

41:21.839 --> 41:23.405
I just wanna have it.

41:23.407 --> 41:24.607
By the way, Lena, you
gotta tell me your secret.

41:24.609 --> 41:25.541
I've been trying
to get her to do

41:25.543 --> 41:26.741
adventurous shit for years.

41:26.743 --> 41:28.576
No secret, it
was just her time.

41:28.578 --> 41:30.114
So, how are we feeling?

41:31.014 --> 41:32.547
Weird, I guess.

41:32.549 --> 41:33.482
- Yeah.
- I guess.

41:33.484 --> 41:34.150
It's great, right?

41:34.152 --> 41:35.083
Yeah.

41:35.085 --> 41:36.451
Where have you been all night?

41:36.453 --> 41:37.920
Just being social.

41:37.922 --> 41:40.021
Hey, can you cover
my shift on Thursday?

41:40.023 --> 41:41.590
I can't Thursday,
it's Jarrod's birthday.

41:41.592 --> 41:43.092
Oh shit, fuck, that's right.

41:43.094 --> 41:44.994
I'll just call
out sick, I guess.

41:44.996 --> 41:47.596
Have you decided what
you're gonna do for him?

41:47.598 --> 41:48.697
No idea.

41:48.699 --> 41:49.931
I don't know.

41:49.933 --> 41:51.099
She can't decide where to
take Jarrod for his birthday.

41:51.101 --> 41:52.534
I say she should just get him

41:52.536 --> 41:54.069
a round of golf at
the country club.

41:54.071 --> 41:54.969
He doesn't golf.

41:54.971 --> 41:55.971
All straight men golf.

41:55.973 --> 41:56.838
What are you talking about?

41:56.840 --> 41:57.773
Whoa, whoa, okay.

41:57.775 --> 41:58.710
Well what is he into then?

42:00.610 --> 42:02.043
Oh my God, how high are you?

42:03.181 --> 42:04.913
I'm not.

42:04.915 --> 42:07.650
I don't know, I just wanna
do something really special.

42:07.652 --> 42:08.951
Okay, well you gonna
figure out how to do that

42:08.953 --> 42:09.821
on your budget?

42:11.188 --> 42:12.654
I have a great idea.

42:19.063 --> 42:20.596
Yes.

42:20.598 --> 42:21.465
Cool.

42:27.605 --> 42:28.536
Do you want a drink?

42:28.538 --> 42:29.737
Yeah.

42:29.739 --> 42:32.007
Can we get a vodka
soda, bourbon soda?

43:43.246 --> 43:44.712
Hey.

43:44.714 --> 43:46.148
- Hey.
- I'm so glad you made it.

43:46.150 --> 43:48.717
Yeah, well you know,
it's a special occasion.

43:48.719 --> 43:49.717
Hi.

43:49.719 --> 43:51.020
Oh, this is my old man.

43:51.022 --> 43:52.154
Oh, the birthday boy.

43:53.257 --> 43:54.155
I'm Jarrod

43:54.157 --> 43:55.824
and I'm not that old.

43:55.826 --> 43:57.159
Yeah, he's kidding you.

43:57.161 --> 43:58.563
So what'd you guys think?

43:59.630 --> 44:01.563
It's okay, go ahead.

44:01.565 --> 44:02.965
Pretty hot, I'm not gonna lie.

44:02.967 --> 44:04.199
Look at him, he's blushing.

44:04.201 --> 44:06.302
I just don't get out to a
lot of these types of places.

44:06.304 --> 44:07.739
Yeah, you better not be.

44:09.139 --> 44:10.973
Hey, we're gonna take
really good care of you.

44:10.975 --> 44:12.308
Okay.

44:39.203 --> 44:41.270
What,
are you watching me?

44:41.272 --> 44:42.139
Yeah.

44:44.174 --> 44:45.708
You little creeper.

44:47.043 --> 44:48.344
Shut up.

44:51.982 --> 44:53.815
Thanks for last night.

44:53.817 --> 44:54.750
You had a good time?

44:54.752 --> 44:56.217
Yeah, I had fun.

44:56.219 --> 44:57.087
Good.

44:58.822 --> 45:00.025
Happy birthday.

45:01.092 --> 45:02.724
We need to get this hair cut.

45:07.697 --> 45:08.567
Are we okay?

45:09.699 --> 45:11.733
Yeah, of course we are.

45:11.735 --> 45:13.101
Why?

45:13.103 --> 45:13.971
No reason.

45:14.938 --> 45:15.837
I love you.

45:15.839 --> 45:16.774
Love you.

45:38.996 --> 45:41.063
So what happened?

45:41.065 --> 45:43.132
Nothing you
haven't heard before.

45:43.134 --> 45:46.268
I fell for another
pretty-faced fuck boy

45:46.270 --> 45:48.672
who had no intention of
being honest with me.

45:49.739 --> 45:50.838
What'd he lie about?

45:50.840 --> 45:52.107
Everything.

45:52.109 --> 45:54.179
I mean, like, everything.

45:55.746 --> 45:57.779
Were you in love with him?

45:57.781 --> 45:58.782
Maybe at one point.

46:00.083 --> 46:02.087
But I had my doubts
more than anything.

46:03.888 --> 46:06.422
Well college guys
can be real assholes.

46:06.424 --> 46:07.659
Professors can too.

46:08.993 --> 46:09.858
Professor?

46:12.063 --> 46:13.398
So is your family from here?

46:15.165 --> 46:16.234
Just me, mostly.

46:17.400 --> 46:18.268
Parents?

46:19.436 --> 46:20.768
Father's around

46:20.770 --> 46:23.072
but we haven't really
seen eye-to-eye

46:23.074 --> 46:24.309
for the last few years.

46:26.043 --> 46:28.309
Does he know where you work?

46:28.311 --> 46:29.214
He does now.

46:30.147 --> 46:32.380
Does he treat
you different now?

46:32.382 --> 46:33.283
Sort of.

46:34.752 --> 46:35.420
I don't know.

46:36.453 --> 46:37.321
Think he just

46:38.288 --> 46:40.658
thinks he's taking care
of me or something.

46:41.792 --> 46:43.224
I know
what that's like.

46:43.226 --> 46:44.759
Really?

46:44.761 --> 46:45.795
Yeah.

46:45.797 --> 46:47.962
My mom wasn't too crazy
about me marrying Jarrod

46:47.964 --> 46:49.498
right after high school.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.166
She just wanted me
to go off to college

46:51.168 --> 46:53.469
and find some rich guy.

46:53.471 --> 46:55.904
When he could take
it from there.

46:55.906 --> 46:57.338
It's funny.

46:57.340 --> 46:59.141
They raise us to be these
strong, independent women

46:59.143 --> 47:00.476
and then they complain
when we can't find a man

47:00.478 --> 47:02.844
to take care of us.

47:02.846 --> 47:04.682
Oh, what time is it?

47:06.484 --> 47:07.483
Almost six.

47:07.485 --> 47:08.750
Oh, I gotta go.

47:08.752 --> 47:10.819
I wanna beat Jarrod home so I
can make him something to eat.

47:10.821 --> 47:11.920
Yeah, I should go too.

47:11.922 --> 47:14.125
Hey, why don't you come over?

47:15.493 --> 47:18.096
You can tell me more about
this douche bag professor.

47:19.230 --> 47:20.295
Yeah, okay.

47:20.297 --> 47:21.166
I can always eat.

47:27.971 --> 47:29.237
Make yourself at home.

47:29.239 --> 47:30.107
Okay.

47:48.025 --> 47:49.791
Red or white?

47:49.793 --> 47:50.525
Red.

47:50.527 --> 47:51.395
Cool.

47:54.498 --> 47:56.297
And that's a deal
breaker for you?

47:56.299 --> 47:58.000
If a guy can't
get it that right,

47:58.002 --> 48:00.802
why am I gonna put in
the time, you know?

48:00.804 --> 48:01.473
I guess.

48:04.275 --> 48:06.077
Does Jarrod still
go down on you?

48:07.011 --> 48:08.009
Occasionally.

48:08.011 --> 48:09.511
Only occasionally?

48:09.513 --> 48:10.878
We're married.

48:14.585 --> 48:15.884
Babe!

48:15.886 --> 48:17.251
Speaking of the devil.

48:17.253 --> 48:19.257
Hey.

48:20.290 --> 48:21.223
I'm a little drunk.

48:21.225 --> 48:22.858
Yeah, I can tell.

48:24.027 --> 48:25.126
Hey, what's up, Lena?

48:25.128 --> 48:26.561
What's up, man?

48:26.563 --> 48:27.962
You smell.

48:27.964 --> 48:29.399
I'm gonna
go take a shower.

48:34.003 --> 48:35.540
I like him.

48:37.975 --> 48:39.377
Yeah, me too.

48:44.047 --> 48:44.915
I have an idea.

48:45.949 --> 48:46.817
If you trust me.

48:51.889 --> 48:53.487
What the hell is that?

48:53.489 --> 48:55.793
Remember that stuff you
smoked the other night?

48:56.893 --> 48:59.263
This is just a
little bit stronger.

49:02.333 --> 49:03.465
I don't know about this.

49:03.467 --> 49:04.869
Just watch me, okay?

49:27.958 --> 49:29.160
It's not so bad, right?

49:31.161 --> 49:32.030
Okay.

49:44.507 --> 49:45.375
You're okay.

49:58.554 --> 50:00.257
How're you feeling?

54:06.302 --> 54:08.603
What time you go in?

54:08.605 --> 54:09.938
I'm opening.

54:09.940 --> 54:11.605
I can take you.

54:11.607 --> 54:13.110
Greg's already on his way.

54:15.645 --> 54:16.513
You wanna talk?

54:17.581 --> 54:18.449
About what?

54:20.884 --> 54:21.752
Last night.

54:23.686 --> 54:24.554
Not really.

54:27.257 --> 54:28.623
You all right?

54:28.625 --> 54:29.527
I'm fine.

54:30.661 --> 54:31.729
You don't seem fine.

54:33.730 --> 54:35.333
I don't wanna talk about it.

54:41.270 --> 54:43.507
Well I guess I'll see
you tonight then, huh?

54:45.842 --> 54:47.445
Can I pick you up, at least?

55:04.594 --> 55:05.927
Hey, Sara, after you clock in,

55:05.929 --> 55:07.695
do you mind getting
started on the patio?

55:07.697 --> 55:08.663
Sure.

55:08.665 --> 55:09.567
Have you seen Greg?

55:10.701 --> 55:12.733
Yeah, he's having a smoke.

55:12.735 --> 55:14.569
Of course he is.

55:20.310 --> 55:22.309
What're you doing here?

55:22.311 --> 55:23.580
I'm here to talk to Sara.

55:25.781 --> 55:26.650
Hey.

55:28.384 --> 55:29.851
Can we talk?

55:29.853 --> 55:31.319
I'm busy.

55:31.321 --> 55:32.556
It's kind of important.

55:33.556 --> 55:35.590
God, I feel like an idiot.

55:35.592 --> 55:36.824
Let me explain.

55:36.826 --> 55:38.425
Go ahead,

55:38.427 --> 55:41.199
because I don't even know
what to think right now.

55:42.565 --> 55:45.599
Look, I woke up this morning
and I looked over at you two

55:45.601 --> 55:47.605
and I realized that
I'm the third wheel.

55:48.804 --> 55:50.005
I don't wanna be
the third wheel.

55:50.007 --> 55:50.875
Stop.

55:56.380 --> 55:58.249
I wanna be close
to you, you know?

55:59.415 --> 56:01.882
And I know that
that sounds stupid.

56:01.884 --> 56:04.351
But my brain's just crazy and
I have to tell you how I feel.

56:04.353 --> 56:05.223
I'm married.

56:07.790 --> 56:09.791
Okay, I love my husband.

56:09.793 --> 56:12.360
And last night we
cheated on each other.

56:12.362 --> 56:14.829
Do you even understand how
big of a deal that is to me?

56:14.831 --> 56:17.868
You look me in the eye and
you tell me you feel nothing.

56:18.902 --> 56:20.705
And if you don't, I'll go.

56:22.806 --> 56:24.375
I'm sorry, okay?

56:25.509 --> 56:26.875
Last night was just
a huge mistake.

56:26.877 --> 56:28.378
Never should've happened.

56:34.518 --> 56:35.686
I can't see you anymore.

56:38.822 --> 56:39.690
Can you just

56:41.657 --> 56:42.525
respect that?

56:46.797 --> 56:48.395
Fine.

56:58.407 --> 56:59.074
You okay?

57:05.982 --> 57:07.752
There's a new bank going up.

57:09.685 --> 57:11.953
Looks like it.

57:11.955 --> 57:13.391
Maybe they're hiring.

57:17.960 --> 57:19.527
I can stop.

57:19.529 --> 57:20.527
Why?

57:20.529 --> 57:22.563
Because I just said,
maybe they're hiring.

57:22.565 --> 57:24.065
So you want me
to work at a bank?

57:24.067 --> 57:24.935
You know what?

57:25.969 --> 57:26.835
Forget about it.

57:26.837 --> 57:27.770
No, say it.

57:27.772 --> 57:29.570
Say you want me to
work at a fucking bank.

57:29.572 --> 57:31.840
You're the one who
wants a better job.

57:31.842 --> 57:33.641
Did it ever occur to
you that I might be okay

57:33.643 --> 57:34.811
with the job I have?

57:42.618 --> 57:46.054
What the fuck is going
on in your head, huh?

57:46.056 --> 57:47.989
I'm out there busting
my fucking ass

57:47.991 --> 57:49.560
so we can start a family!

57:50.893 --> 57:52.962
And you're playing house
with a goddamn stripper?!

57:54.063 --> 57:55.963
I don't want you
seeing her anymore!

57:55.965 --> 57:57.965
And that's gonna fix it?

57:57.967 --> 57:58.935
It's that simple?

58:03.105 --> 58:04.475
You fucked her!

58:13.884 --> 58:14.985
I fucked her too.

58:17.853 --> 58:18.888
Don't follow me.

58:41.811 --> 58:42.777
Hey there, sweetie.

58:42.779 --> 58:43.911
Hi.

58:43.913 --> 58:45.582
What's your name?

58:49.518 --> 58:50.520
Have a seat.

59:01.531 --> 59:05.603
Just relax, I'm gonna give
you a good time, okay?

59:10.607 --> 59:12.206
Hey, what did I just tell you?

59:12.208 --> 59:15.509
Fuck you, I paid for this!

59:15.511 --> 59:17.110
Give me a descent fucking dance.

59:17.112 --> 59:18.047
That's all I want.

59:19.549 --> 59:21.081
Last try.

59:27.891 --> 59:28.989
Come on.

59:28.991 --> 59:30.090
Let go of me!

59:30.092 --> 59:31.058
Hey!

59:31.060 --> 59:32.826
Give me back my fucking money!

59:32.828 --> 59:34.197
This is bullshit!

59:46.509 --> 59:47.808
Hey, what happened in there?

59:47.810 --> 59:49.110
Are you okay?

59:49.112 --> 59:50.677
Just some creep.

59:50.679 --> 59:51.549
I'm fine.

59:52.848 --> 59:54.983
Why don't you
head out tonight?

59:54.985 --> 59:56.284
I need to cut some
staff and you look like

59:56.286 --> 59:57.719
you could use a break.

59:57.721 --> 59:59.119
Thank you.

59:59.121 --> 01:00:00.855
All right, well get some rest

01:00:00.857 --> 01:00:02.891
and call me later, okay?

01:00:28.884 --> 01:00:30.050
Hey!

01:00:31.788 --> 01:00:32.753
Fucking slut!

01:00:57.147 --> 01:00:59.713
If it doesn't
fit, don't force it.

01:00:59.715 --> 01:01:00.949
I think this one's defective.

01:01:02.185 --> 01:01:04.351
Why is it that none of
my pieces are defective?

01:01:04.353 --> 01:01:05.219
I don't know.

01:01:05.221 --> 01:01:06.186
Mhmm.

01:01:06.188 --> 01:01:07.588
That's why I picked you.

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.023
Thanks for that.

01:01:09.025 --> 01:01:09.958
There you go.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.059
Look, I got one.

01:01:13.797 --> 01:01:14.829
You're not very good

01:01:14.831 --> 01:01:17.965
at this puzzling thing.

01:01:22.072 --> 01:01:24.371
Lena, my God!

01:01:24.373 --> 01:01:25.907
What happened?

01:01:25.909 --> 01:01:27.175
I got jumped.

01:01:27.177 --> 01:01:28.275
What?

01:01:30.212 --> 01:01:31.679
Did you see him?

01:01:31.681 --> 01:01:33.648
- Yeah.
- Did you see him? Who was it?

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:34.648
He was some
asshole at the club.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.217
Okay, were you hurt?

01:01:36.219 --> 01:01:37.351
Show me where you're hurt.

01:01:37.353 --> 01:01:38.920
Now try to breathe, now.

01:01:38.922 --> 01:01:39.786
Breathe, okay?

01:01:40.889 --> 01:01:43.090
Oh, Jesus.

01:01:43.092 --> 01:01:44.324
Call the ER.

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:45.626
It's too late, tell
them to meet us there.

01:01:45.628 --> 01:01:46.761
No, I don't wanna go.

01:01:46.763 --> 01:01:47.962
- You gotta go.
- No, I don't wanna go.

01:01:47.964 --> 01:01:49.396
You gotta go,
honey, you gotta go.

01:01:49.398 --> 01:01:50.831
You gotta go.

01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:52.065
Breathe, sweetheart,
you gotta breathe.

01:01:52.067 --> 01:01:53.367
Just breathe.

01:02:16.359 --> 01:02:17.226
Hey.

01:02:21.397 --> 01:02:22.265
Easy.

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:29.904
You look like hell.

01:02:29.906 --> 01:02:30.773
Shut up.

01:02:35.411 --> 01:02:37.411
Are you feeling any better?

01:02:37.413 --> 01:02:38.281
I'll live.

01:02:40.949 --> 01:02:43.684
I don't know if you know this
but the police have the guy.

01:02:43.686 --> 01:02:45.786
Yeah, my boss texted
me like a hundred times.

01:02:47.891 --> 01:02:49.257
I do have some
good news though.

01:02:49.259 --> 01:02:51.291
Got a phone call last night.

01:02:51.293 --> 01:02:52.927
The university.

01:02:52.929 --> 01:02:53.831
They wanna settle.

01:02:56.132 --> 01:02:57.331
I don't know what you said

01:02:57.333 --> 01:02:59.132
to get that prick
to sign the papers

01:02:59.134 --> 01:03:02.339
but whatever it was, it worked.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:10.811
So it's over?

01:03:10.813 --> 01:03:11.779
It's over.

01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:12.650
You won.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.288
So what's next?

01:03:59.462 --> 01:04:01.228
Hope I got enough.

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:03.100
Grabbed everything
that looked clean.

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:06.000
That's great.

01:04:06.002 --> 01:04:06.869
Thanks.

01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:09.337
Okay.

01:04:09.339 --> 01:04:10.771
I'll let you get dressed.

01:04:10.773 --> 01:04:12.342
Breakfast should be
ready in a minute.

01:04:14.377 --> 01:04:15.244
Hey, dad?

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:21.251
It's good to be home.

01:04:38.868 --> 01:04:39.737
Hey.

01:04:41.538 --> 01:04:43.270
Hi.

01:04:43.272 --> 01:04:44.373
Is Sara here?

01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.976
No, she's out.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.478
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

01:04:51.915 --> 01:04:54.148
Just one minute, please.

01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:08.895
What happened to you?

01:05:09.898 --> 01:05:11.998
You should see the other guy.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.869
Yeah, I bet.

01:05:15.605 --> 01:05:18.775
I just want to
clear up a few things.

01:05:21.177 --> 01:05:24.311
Had some really weird
shit happen recently.

01:05:24.313 --> 01:05:25.346
No.

01:05:25.348 --> 01:05:26.215
Stop.

01:05:27.917 --> 01:05:28.983
Well.

01:05:28.985 --> 01:05:29.853
I get it.

01:05:32.188 --> 01:05:34.355
All that stuff that
happened with you and Sara.

01:05:34.357 --> 01:05:35.290
It's over.

01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:36.357
That's what I wanna
talk to you about.

01:05:36.359 --> 01:05:37.391
She's pregnant.

01:05:37.393 --> 01:05:38.262
Oh.

01:05:39.328 --> 01:05:40.196
Wow.

01:05:41.464 --> 01:05:43.297
That's great.

01:05:43.299 --> 01:05:44.168
Thanks.

01:05:47.469 --> 01:05:48.471
We're really happy.

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:52.475
You know, I never
meant to hurt anybody.

01:05:54.344 --> 01:05:55.212
I know.

01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:03.819
Hey, I wish you the best
of luck with everything.

01:06:16.165 --> 01:06:18.235
Can you at least
tell her I stopped by?

01:06:21.237 --> 01:06:22.105
Probably not.

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:36.583
I've gotta
cut some of these girls.

01:06:36.585 --> 01:06:38.585
If you fire them,
you gotta replace them.

01:06:38.587 --> 01:06:40.089
I'm not getting on no pole.

01:06:43.058 --> 01:06:44.625
Hey.

01:06:48.464 --> 01:06:50.933
- Thank you, John John,
- Don't even worry about it.

01:06:52.101 --> 01:06:53.601
Come here.

01:06:53.603 --> 01:06:55.001
Oh, why didn't you call me?

01:06:55.003 --> 01:06:56.938
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.672
Oh, honey.

01:06:57.674 --> 01:06:59.674
I felt really bad about this.

01:06:59.676 --> 01:07:01.011
Don't worry about it.

01:07:02.978 --> 01:07:04.277
You need anything from me?

01:07:04.279 --> 01:07:05.982
I just came here to thank you.

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.252
You're not coming
back, are you?

01:07:13.022 --> 01:07:14.991
I wish I could say
I was surprised.

01:07:16.292 --> 01:07:18.159
I just need a change.

01:07:18.161 --> 01:07:19.159
I was right.

01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:20.661
But you're not off the hook.

01:07:20.663 --> 01:07:24.398
No, you have to promise
that you're gonna come back

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.398
and you're gonna
check in with us

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.701
every once and awhile, okay?

01:07:26.703 --> 01:07:27.567
Of course.

01:07:27.569 --> 01:07:28.703
All right, good.

01:07:28.705 --> 01:07:30.040
Because we're
gonna miss you, so.
