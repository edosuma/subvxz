Previously on <i>House of Lies</i>...

00:08.794 --> 00:10.458
<i>Do you know that</i>
<i>Dre's motherfucking ass</i>

00:10.459 --> 00:12.126
has not been to this place

00:12.180 --> 00:13.579
since we moved production?

00:13.580 --> 00:15.446
Lukas is all,
"DollaHyde my baby."

00:15.447 --> 00:17.479
Well, DollaHyde's my baby, too.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.179
You want final approval
of our floor displays.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.212
And that would be
a deal breaker.

00:21.213 --> 00:23.312
You're okay with
what just happened?

00:23.313 --> 00:25.912
You think because I was laughing
that I'm okay with it?

00:25.913 --> 00:27.612
<i>You were gonna use</i>
<i>my painful breakup,</i>

00:27.613 --> 00:29.346
<i>your separation from your wife,</i>

00:29.347 --> 00:30.612
to try to fuck me?

00:30.613 --> 00:33.312
<i>I blacked out, so I don't know</i>

00:33.313 --> 00:36.212
if we... I'm not saying
for a fact that we did.

00:36.213 --> 00:37.312
I don't remember, either.

00:37.313 --> 00:39.579
You remember when
you were in sober living

00:39.580 --> 00:40.546
because you had a drug problem?

00:40.547 --> 00:41.679
<i>We're too fucked up.</i>

00:41.680 --> 00:44.346
There's no fixing us, right?
I...

00:44.347 --> 00:45.812
Yeah, maybe.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.846
This right here is gonna
make me fucking rich.

00:47.847 --> 00:50.879
<i>That disgusting brown drink</i>
<i>that I guzzle down like come</i>

00:50.880 --> 00:52.646
has saved me from having to
purchase a meal in over a week.

00:52.647 --> 00:53.779
Well, I know
one thing's for sure...

00:53.780 --> 00:55.679
we're not gonna be
the blood brothers

00:55.680 --> 00:57.380
on the corners
that we once were.

personal, I guess.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.612
Okay.

02:08.613 --> 02:11.079
Are you sure
you're okay to drive?

02:11.080 --> 02:13.279
Yes. I'm fine.
'Cause I could just drive you...

02:13.280 --> 02:16.112
I'm fine.

02:16.113 --> 02:17.646
Okay.

02:17.647 --> 02:19.247
I'm gonna go.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.046
I know I look like
a meth addict, but I can make

02:52.047 --> 02:54.346
your life a living hell,
so keep that in mind.

02:54.347 --> 02:56.979
I... like your shoes.

02:56.980 --> 02:58.012
Attaboy.
Mm-hmm.

02:58.013 --> 02:59.446
Hey, um, can you check

02:59.447 --> 03:01.046
the DollaHyde pro forma
revenue models

03:01.047 --> 03:02.346
before the Barneys meeting?

03:02.347 --> 03:04.646
Some of those figures,
they look funky to me.

03:04.647 --> 03:06.012
Are you serious?
The meeting wasn't cancelled?

03:06.013 --> 03:08.212
No. I just got off the phone
with Dre's assistant.

03:08.213 --> 03:09.312
All systems are go.

03:09.313 --> 03:10.746
Huh. Seems a little...

03:10.747 --> 03:11.846
Cold?
Let me tell you something.

03:11.847 --> 03:13.846
I would insist that Marty
cancel all our meetings

03:13.847 --> 03:14.946
if you were murdered.

03:14.947 --> 03:16.479
Thank you, Doug.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.912
I mean that.
And where are we at with

03:17.913 --> 03:20.412
Deutsche Bank on setting
the final IPO for WON? Uh, no,

03:20.413 --> 03:22.479
Clyde's dealing with that.
Well, do you know where he is?

03:22.480 --> 03:24.312
I don't know. Not here yet.
Um, actually,

03:24.313 --> 03:26.154
Jeannie, could I talk
to you about something...

03:32.013 --> 03:33.913
Shut up.

03:37.247 --> 03:38.246
Jeannie Van Der Hooven.

03:38.247 --> 03:39.312
Where the fuck are you?

03:39.313 --> 03:42.546
I... am at...

03:42.547 --> 03:44.512
ooh...

03:44.513 --> 03:46.846
the Amberley Hotel...

03:46.847 --> 03:48.379
in San Francisco.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.012
How about that?

03:50.013 --> 03:51.312
San Francisco? Are you aware

03:51.313 --> 03:52.846
our offices are in Los Angeles?

03:52.847 --> 03:53.712
Yeah, well,

03:53.713 --> 03:56.346
I am servicing
an account right now.

03:56.347 --> 03:58.512
Okay, well, get on a plane now.
I just have

03:58.513 --> 04:00.412
to service the account
one more time...

04:00.413 --> 04:01.779
probably from behind.

04:01.780 --> 04:03.212
Lukas Frye was
murdered last night.

04:03.213 --> 04:05.579
What are you talking about?
Just...

04:05.580 --> 04:07.646
get back here now, please.

04:07.647 --> 04:08.912
What, Doug?

04:08.913 --> 04:10.246
Oh, yeah.

04:10.247 --> 04:11.979
So, listen, um...

04:11.980 --> 04:13.712
about WON.

04:13.713 --> 04:15.746
I-I've been sampling it,
you know that,

04:15.747 --> 04:18.978
and I might have experienced
some side effects.

04:18.980 --> 04:20.978
What kind of side effects?

04:20.980 --> 04:22.879
Um, last night, um...

04:22.880 --> 04:25.712
I noticed a slight
enlargement in my, uh...

04:25.713 --> 04:27.512
pectoral region.

04:27.513 --> 04:30.046
Douglas Guggenheim,
are you getting boobs?

04:30.047 --> 04:32.446
No. Please don't touch them.
They're very sensitive.

04:32.447 --> 04:34.512
Oh, my God.
Um, the doctor says

04:34.513 --> 04:36.979
it's likely the result of
a spike in my estrogen levels,

04:36.980 --> 04:38.679
probably related
to a change in diet.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.579
But if it is the result of WON,

04:41.580 --> 04:43.612
well, then that's a huge
clusterfuck for Monica.

04:43.613 --> 04:45.179
All right,

04:45.180 --> 04:46.712
I'll-I'll look into it.
Great.

04:46.713 --> 04:48.779
Uh, anything I can do?
You can get yourself a bra.

04:48.780 --> 04:51.313
This is a place of business;
I need you to be professional.

04:53.580 --> 04:54.946
Ow.

04:54.947 --> 04:57.179
How did <i> you</i> sleep?

04:57.180 --> 04:58.512
Like shit.

04:58.513 --> 05:00.479
But, you know, I don't sleep, so...
Me, neither.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.112
What do you think happened?

05:02.113 --> 05:03.779
I don't know.
It certainly looked

05:03.780 --> 05:04.912
like a gang hit.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.879
Maybe too obviously

05:06.880 --> 05:08.246
like a gang hit.

05:08.247 --> 05:09.446
Could you remind me
which one you are again?

05:09.447 --> 05:10.746
Is it Cagney or Lacey?

05:10.747 --> 05:12.279
Wow, sweet '80s
reference, Chief.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.479
Thank you.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.512
You can't tell me
that the thought

05:15.513 --> 05:16.846
hasn't crossed your mind that...

05:16.847 --> 05:18.546
I-I can't take you seriously

05:18.547 --> 05:19.712
with your tooth like that.

05:19.713 --> 05:21.312
I am getting it
fixed later today,

05:21.313 --> 05:22.779
so shut the fuck up.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.546
Have you spoken to Dre?

05:24.547 --> 05:26.179
Jeannie, uh...
Just call him.

05:26.180 --> 05:27.579
See how he's doing.
And then just

05:27.580 --> 05:28.979
slip into the conversation,

05:28.980 --> 05:30.846
"Hey, did you have
your friend Lukas murdered?"

05:30.847 --> 05:31.979
I don't know,
see where the conversation goes.

05:31.980 --> 05:33.246
Right.

05:33.247 --> 05:34.812
I know he's your buddy, Marty,
and it's not like

05:34.813 --> 05:36.912
I'm rooting for
his involvement, but...

05:36.913 --> 05:38.479
Listen, Dre is...

05:38.480 --> 05:41.312
He's been involved
in some bad shit, okay?

05:41.313 --> 05:42.612
He's ruthless.

05:42.613 --> 05:44.246
He'd never because you'd never?

05:44.247 --> 05:46.279
You think you two are the same,

05:46.280 --> 05:47.679
but...

05:47.680 --> 05:50.879
God... and I mean this in
the nicest way possible, Marty...

05:50.880 --> 05:52.013
you're not.

05:54.447 --> 05:55.779
I just had an epiphany.

05:55.780 --> 05:57.646
I've got to get my own office.

05:57.647 --> 05:59.579
No, Lukas's death... it
really got me thinking.

05:59.580 --> 06:01.646
You know, made me...
it's made me take stock

06:01.647 --> 06:03.346
of what-what
matters in life.

06:03.347 --> 06:04.579
Oh, but you weren't even there.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.812
But I knew him.
I knew him.

06:05.813 --> 06:07.046
Oh, of course.
Yeah, you killed his dog.

06:07.047 --> 06:08.546
Okay, yeah, Clyde.
Forgive me

06:08.547 --> 06:10.412
that I care about people who die.
Mm-hmm.

06:10.413 --> 06:13.212
And dogs, who die.
Who you murder.

06:13.213 --> 06:15.212
I need to work on my marriage.

06:15.213 --> 06:16.879
Oh, is this the epiphany?
It's Sarah.

06:16.880 --> 06:18.646
I mean, it's always been Sarah.
Of course.

06:18.647 --> 06:21.146
Except for when it was Caitlin.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.579
Okay, yeah, sure.

06:23.580 --> 06:26.646
I may have lusted in my heart,
but I never strayed.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.412
Right.
Because she wouldn't let you.

06:28.413 --> 06:29.512
Because I decided...

06:29.513 --> 06:31.079
Nice of you to join us, Clyde.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.779
Oh, Jeannie!

06:32.780 --> 06:35.312
Jeannie! Embracing
your hillbilly roots.

06:35.313 --> 06:38.012
Very chichi.
I like it very much.

06:38.013 --> 06:39.646
Yeah, hey, ain't that the tooth.

06:39.647 --> 06:42.146
Sarah's gonna love that joke.

06:42.147 --> 06:43.679
Ain't that the tooth.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.746
Say it like that.
Let me update you real quick.

06:45.747 --> 06:47.779
He is trying to win Sarah back.

06:47.780 --> 06:49.712
Because Lukas died,
and not because

06:49.713 --> 06:51.112
Caitlin absolutely
demolished him last night.

06:51.113 --> 06:52.579
She doesn't need
to know all that.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.980
So Sarah likes girls now?

06:55.380 --> 06:56.412
'Cause you have fun bags.

06:56.413 --> 06:58.179
Doug has fun bags?

06:58.180 --> 06:59.746
You haven't heard?
No.

06:59.747 --> 07:02.146
Our little girl is
going through puberty.

07:02.147 --> 07:03.412
Douglas is?

07:03.413 --> 07:05.579
Okay, let's get this over with.

07:05.580 --> 07:08.046
Yeah, I have experienced
some temporary

07:08.047 --> 07:10.846
pectoral growth due to a spike

07:10.847 --> 07:12.746
in my estrogen levels, so that's it.
Mm-hmm.

07:12.747 --> 07:14.246
Is this a real thing?

07:14.247 --> 07:16.512
Yeah. You swear to me this
is a real thing? Aw.

07:16.513 --> 07:19.079
May I see them, Doug? I would like to
see them, please. Certainly not.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.146
I think he's just embarrassed
'cause they're kind of teensy.

07:21.147 --> 07:22.846
Oh, no, they're tiny titty tops?

07:22.847 --> 07:24.879
You know what,
you shouldn't even feel ashamed.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.346
Lugging big old titties around,
you can get back problems.

07:26.347 --> 07:28.012
And I say fuck you

07:28.013 --> 07:31.012
to all those guys
who do not love you for you.

07:31.013 --> 07:33.446
I wouldn't mind bigger tits,
you know what I mean?

07:33.447 --> 07:35.279
What's this WON shit
taste like, anyway?

07:35.280 --> 07:37.579
Dude, I love your tits
just the way they are.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.912
Oh.
There they are.

07:38.913 --> 07:40.412
Aw, he loves my tits.

07:40.413 --> 07:42.212
I like to put
smiley face in between,

07:42.213 --> 07:44.246
so it looks like they're
talking to me all the time. Like...

07:44.247 --> 07:46.646
You get it. Don't pretend you
don't get it; you get it.

07:46.647 --> 07:49.112
How was the rest of your
morning in San Francisco? It was... good.

07:49.113 --> 07:50.879
Yeah? It was good.
I sold off McClintock Media

07:50.880 --> 07:52.046
for $4.2 billion.

07:52.047 --> 07:54.912
You just sold McClintock Media,
just quickly sold it...

07:54.913 --> 07:56.946
this morning?

07:56.947 --> 07:58.279
Are you being serious?
Did you really sell

07:58.280 --> 08:00.046
your company this morning?
We've been in quiet negotiations

08:00.047 --> 08:01.846
for, like, a week, so yeah.

08:01.847 --> 08:03.379
You never thought to mention it to your
consultant-slash-boyfriend,

08:03.380 --> 08:05.779
the person who's been working on this
with you for the whole fucking time?

08:05.780 --> 08:07.446
Uh... mm.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.679
That's huge, by the way.
That's fucking enormous. Yeah.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.112
You put any thought into what
you're gonna do with that new cash flow?

08:12.113 --> 08:14.812
First I'm gonna buy you and
me a pretty little outfit.

08:14.813 --> 08:17.012
A matching outfit? Okay.
Yes, obviously.

08:17.013 --> 08:19.979
And then I'll probably blow
a ton of it on heroin.

08:19.980 --> 08:21.312
That's an amazing plan,

08:21.313 --> 08:23.579
and I don't want to throw
you away from that, but...

08:23.580 --> 08:25.346
anytime you want to come in,
Marty would have

08:25.347 --> 08:26.646
some mind-blowing ideas for you.
Mm.

08:26.647 --> 08:27.879
I love Marty...

08:27.880 --> 08:30.046
I do... and in a world
where we weren't dating,

08:30.047 --> 08:31.446
I'd be all over
that black dick...

08:31.447 --> 08:32.979
but I'm pretty much
done with K&A.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.279
I mean, I got what I needed.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.746
You know?

08:35.746 --> 08:38.279
Mmm. This butternut
squash is amazing.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.578
What the fuck did
they put in this? Mmm!

08:40.580 --> 08:43.111
Do want to stop fucking
stealing the food from my plate

08:43.113 --> 08:45.279
when you're ruining my life?
No problem. I'll order my own.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.612
Where's the guy? You know
I'm on shaky ground with Marty.

08:47.613 --> 08:49.912
I thought we were in a relationship...
we're supposed to look out for each other.

08:49.913 --> 08:50.912
We're not supposed
to fuck each other over.

08:50.913 --> 08:52.912
Okay, just because I
let you put your mouth

08:52.913 --> 08:55.046
on my vagina, I'm supposed to
write you checks for the rest of my life?

08:55.047 --> 08:56.512
You're missing the point.
That's not what I mean.

08:56.513 --> 08:58.446
This relationship started
because you came by sober living

08:58.447 --> 08:59.679
to drum up business.
Okay, fine,

08:59.680 --> 09:01.712
it was a slimy beginning, but
I thought we moved past that.

09:01.713 --> 09:04.512
Forget it. Let's just go do
a bump in the bathroom. Okay?

09:04.513 --> 09:06.112
Hey, girls, we're
gonna go do a bump

09:06.113 --> 09:07.612
in the bathroom,
so can you watch our food?

09:07.613 --> 09:09.312
I don't want them to clear it.

09:09.313 --> 09:11.246
Maybe we should just end this.
Okay.

09:11.247 --> 09:13.312
"Okay"?
Just like that? "Okay"?

09:13.313 --> 09:15.746
I said "maybe we should
just end this," and you say fucking "okay"?

09:15.747 --> 09:18.312
I can't believe I couldn't see how fucking
self-centered you are.

09:18.313 --> 09:20.612
Your ATM of a girlfriend
stops spitting out hundies,

09:20.613 --> 09:23.412
and your first instinct
is to end things? No.

09:23.413 --> 09:25.112
Yeah. I'm the
self-centered one.

09:25.113 --> 09:26.946
Okay.
Right. Fuck you.

09:26.947 --> 09:29.279
I'm gonna go do that bump in the bathroom,
so I'll see you later.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.046
You know, her tits suck, by the way.
Mm-hmm.

09:31.047 --> 09:32.112
Your tits are bullshit.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.979
Clyde Oberholt shits
when he comes.

09:33.980 --> 09:35.112
I do not.

09:35.113 --> 09:36.512
- I do not.
- Wow.

09:36.513 --> 09:38.546
Come on.

09:38.547 --> 09:40.746
Oh. Jeannie, Jeannie, wait.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.012
Oh, God, hey.
I'm freaking out here.

09:44.013 --> 09:45.612
Sarah... she's not
returning my calls

09:45.613 --> 09:48.112
or my texts or my anything.
What do I do?

09:48.113 --> 09:49.446
Uh, give up?
What?

09:49.447 --> 09:51.212
I don't know, Doug.
Do something romantic.

09:51.213 --> 09:53.146
Like a dick pic or something?
Marty!

09:53.147 --> 09:54.846
Finally! Please,
can I get a minute?

09:54.847 --> 09:57.279
Whoa-kay, hold on.
Speaking of romantic,

09:57.280 --> 09:58.579
chance of rain tonight.

09:58.580 --> 10:00.412
That's good,
that's great, actually.

10:00.413 --> 10:01.979
You know, in the movies,
when guys are trying

10:01.980 --> 10:03.512
to win back the girl,
they're always, you know,

10:03.513 --> 10:04.712
running through the rain?

10:04.713 --> 10:05.679
That's usually
a real panty melter.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.312
Don't say "panty melter," ever.

10:07.313 --> 10:09.912
This is an independent
clinical study on WON.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.080
Check the date.

10:12.347 --> 10:15.079
Fucking fantastic.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.246
You said you wanted
our expertise.

10:17.247 --> 10:18.579
And really,
you just wanted the manpower

10:18.580 --> 10:19.979
to push you through to the IPO.

10:19.980 --> 10:21.546
And then you...

10:21.547 --> 10:23.746
sell off your shares
for a fat sum

10:23.747 --> 10:25.812
and just fuck
everybody else, right?

10:25.813 --> 10:28.112
I did not keep anything
from you, Marty.

10:28.113 --> 10:30.712
And I... honestly, I didn't
even think that it was relevant.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.346
Or... you were greedy.

10:32.347 --> 10:34.346
Mm.
I think you were just afraid

10:34.347 --> 10:36.179
that we were gonna ask
for higher fees if we knew.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.746
And you should have been afraid,
because, well, we would have.

10:38.747 --> 10:41.187
Oh. But it's nothing compared
to what we're gonna ask for now.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.379
How much do you want?

10:48.380 --> 10:50.346
I don't know.
Jeannie, what do you think?

10:50.347 --> 10:51.346
I don't know, it's hard.

10:51.347 --> 10:53.412
I mean, you know,
you want it to be enough

10:53.413 --> 10:54.846
that she learns a lesson about honesty...
Yeah.

10:54.847 --> 10:56.846
...but not so big
that she'll be tempted

10:56.847 --> 10:59.812
to leak it and fuck us over,
so I think that

10:59.813 --> 11:01.912
I'd probably be satisfied
with 75%

11:01.913 --> 11:03.979
of her shares of WON.
That's...

11:03.980 --> 11:05.512
That's fucking outrageous.

11:05.513 --> 11:06.612
It's nuts.

11:06.613 --> 11:08.746
Yeah.
And our final offer.

11:08.747 --> 11:10.246
Hey, I'll call the lawyers

11:10.247 --> 11:11.980
and have them draw up
some contracts.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.679
♪ Do-do-do-do-do-do. ♪
I'm gonna get a cookie.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.479
Marty...

11:17.480 --> 11:19.446
Marty, no, this isn't...
Don't do this.

11:19.447 --> 11:21.646
This is... this is supposed
to be my ticket back.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.346
You are leaving me scraps.

11:23.347 --> 11:26.279
You know, I...

11:26.280 --> 11:29.379
I genuinely thought
that we had gotten to some...

11:29.380 --> 11:31.312
new place or something,
you know?

11:31.313 --> 11:32.779
When you came over, it felt...

11:32.780 --> 11:34.479
We were both there
for each other

11:34.480 --> 11:36.279
at a vulnerable moment,
and it was real.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.412
I don't know why I believed it.
I was...

11:38.413 --> 11:40.246
I mean, I guess I wanted to.

11:40.247 --> 11:42.912
But it just goes to show you,
if you leave your door unlocked,

11:42.913 --> 11:44.646
you shouldn't be surprised
when somebody comes in

11:44.647 --> 11:46.779
and takes a shit
in the middle of the floor.

11:46.780 --> 11:49.847
I'm gonna go get
that cookie now.

11:59.447 --> 12:00.879
Thank you.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.479
You smug,

12:02.480 --> 12:04.847
self-satisfied... cunt.

12:05.880 --> 12:06.746
Me?

12:06.747 --> 12:10.312
You know what is
so incredibly sad?

12:10.313 --> 12:12.479
I mean, like kill-yourself sad?

12:12.480 --> 12:14.646
I think you actually believe
your own bullshit.

12:14.647 --> 12:18.012
Small-town girl
makes good, right?

12:18.013 --> 12:20.912
Tough, disciplined, independent.

12:20.913 --> 12:22.312
Now there's a fucking joke.

12:22.313 --> 12:23.712
You are just

12:23.713 --> 12:25.979
a remora clinging
to a shark's back.

12:25.980 --> 12:27.546
I know what a shark is.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.346
I'm pretty positive
a remora's a fish.

12:29.347 --> 12:30.712
Let me check.

12:30.713 --> 12:32.646
You would still be
sharpening pencils

12:32.647 --> 12:35.246
at Galweather's
research basement

12:35.247 --> 12:38.246
if Marty hadn't
plucked you out...

12:38.247 --> 12:39.612
given you life.

12:39.613 --> 12:41.746
Marty plucked me out because...

12:41.747 --> 12:43.346
Because he saw something in you?

12:43.347 --> 12:45.012
What Marty saw

12:45.013 --> 12:47.712
was a desperate girl, eager
to shake off the sticks,

12:47.713 --> 12:50.712
whose pussy appeared
open for business.

12:50.713 --> 12:54.512
The reason that you rose
so quickly at Galweather,

12:54.513 --> 12:55.946
the reason that you're here,

12:55.947 --> 13:00.312
the reason you have
any career at all...

13:00.313 --> 13:02.512
because Marty wanted
to fuck you.

13:02.513 --> 13:04.912
Not to say that you have
not played that brilliantly

13:04.913 --> 13:07.746
by not actually fucking him,
but when you do,

13:07.747 --> 13:10.279
he will look at you
and he will see

13:10.280 --> 13:12.279
what the rest of us see,

13:12.280 --> 13:14.813
what everyone has always seen.

13:15.813 --> 13:17.513
Nothing.

13:24.047 --> 13:25.679
The tooth.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.913
It's looking sexy.

13:39.613 --> 13:41.512
<i>First and foremost,</i>

13:41.513 --> 13:44.379
I want to thank you
for having the meeting here.

13:44.380 --> 13:45.812
I mean,
with all that's happened,

13:45.813 --> 13:48.646
things at the DollaHyde offices
are a little, uh...

13:48.647 --> 13:49.979
We were so sorry to hear.

13:49.980 --> 13:51.412
Thank you.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.279
I mean, I still
haven't quite grasped

13:53.280 --> 13:55.680
that it's actually
even happened, that he's gone.

13:57.213 --> 13:58.512
I'm sorry.

13:58.513 --> 14:00.712
You know what?
We can reschedule.

14:00.713 --> 14:02.479
We'll be back in town in two weeks.
No.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.279
No, no, that's exactly...

14:04.280 --> 14:06.112
what we shouldn't do.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.279
We should soldier on.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.846
Lukas helped build this company,

14:08.847 --> 14:10.779
and I can't think
of a better testament

14:10.780 --> 14:12.446
to his memory

14:12.447 --> 14:14.979
than to... ensure its future.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.679
Especially if that future
includes Barneys.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.712
- Absolutely.
- Lukas loved Barneys.

14:20.713 --> 14:22.279
"Barneys this, Barneys that,"

14:22.280 --> 14:23.446
you know,
"Barneys, Barneys, Barneys."

14:23.447 --> 14:25.479
He wouldn't shut up
about it, right?

14:25.480 --> 14:28.479
So, we-we've met
with a few other retailers,

14:28.480 --> 14:31.479
and I'm pretty sure that these
fine folks sitting next to me

14:31.480 --> 14:33.679
would probably advise me
that I'm giving away

14:33.680 --> 14:35.679
the negotiation before
we actually even get started.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.612
But the fact is,

14:37.613 --> 14:39.779
Barneys is the place
I want to be.

14:39.780 --> 14:42.079
Yeah, Dre would kill
to be at Barneys.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.612
That's a poor choice of words.

14:43.613 --> 14:45.179
Um, is, uh...

14:45.180 --> 14:46.547
everything okay, Marty?

14:50.513 --> 14:53.947
No, everything... everything's
not okay, Dre. Excuse me.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.246
Pardon me.

14:57.247 --> 14:58.880
Uh, Jeannie, could you...?

15:08.713 --> 15:10.179
Go away, go away.

15:10.180 --> 15:11.447
No.

15:22.313 --> 15:24.812
I'm guessing
this is the first time

15:24.813 --> 15:26.879
you've ever seen
somebody get killed.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.446
I'm telling you, Marty,

15:28.447 --> 15:30.512
that shit'll fuck you up...
Shut up, please.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.012
Just shut the fuck up, Dre.

15:32.013 --> 15:33.447
Please.

15:35.447 --> 15:37.079
Are you telling me...

15:37.080 --> 15:39.446
Look, don't treat me like
I'm a goddamn idiot, okay?

15:39.447 --> 15:40.879
What are you talking about?

15:40.880 --> 15:43.979
Oh, what, you think I had
something to do with Lukas?

15:43.980 --> 15:45.779
Did you?

15:45.780 --> 15:47.313
You wearing a wire?

15:49.013 --> 15:51.146
Come on, man, that was a joke.

15:51.147 --> 15:53.013
Yeah, it was a good one.

15:54.447 --> 15:56.879
Look, I can see that
you're obviously upset.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.512
I could've got hit, man.

15:58.513 --> 16:00.012
Jeannie could've got hit.

16:00.013 --> 16:02.346
See, whoever did Lukas,
they were professionals,

16:02.347 --> 16:03.512
and professionals,
they don't miss.

16:03.513 --> 16:05.012
Well, we're just assuming
they were pros, right?

16:05.013 --> 16:06.979
'Cause we don't actually
know what happened. No.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.646
Right. And you took
a bullet, too,

16:08.647 --> 16:10.179
so not so professional, I guess.

16:10.180 --> 16:12.712
I mean... unless...

16:12.713 --> 16:14.913
Unless... Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

16:16.813 --> 16:19.646
You go yelling this shit
from the rooftops,

16:19.647 --> 16:21.412
and someone's gonna believe you.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.246
Whether... it's
true or not.

16:24.247 --> 16:26.613
And I can't have that.

16:28.047 --> 16:30.012
You gonna kill me, too, Dre?

16:30.013 --> 16:32.212
You know what?

16:32.213 --> 16:34.446
Do it. Do me a
fucking favor, man.

16:34.447 --> 16:36.112
Or do you make a phone call?

16:36.113 --> 16:38.046
H-How does it work?
You got these guys on speed dial?

16:38.047 --> 16:40.213
Give me the phone.
I'll do it.

16:43.780 --> 16:46.980
You change your mind,
you got my address.

17:21.180 --> 17:22.979
Oh.

17:22.980 --> 17:24.445
Hey, asshole.

17:24.446 --> 17:26.646
And we're right back into it
with the witty banter.

17:26.646 --> 17:29.246
Wait, now, hold on, hold on.
Sarah, Sar, please wait.

17:29.247 --> 17:30.546
Please.

17:30.547 --> 17:33.046
I'm sorry. I...
Look,

17:33.047 --> 17:35.446
I don't know what I can say
to make things right

17:35.447 --> 17:37.712
or what I can do.

17:37.713 --> 17:41.346
I-I... I just know
that I need you in my life.

17:41.347 --> 17:42.746
I do.
Doug,

17:42.747 --> 17:43.779
just... I'm sor...

17:43.780 --> 17:45.346
Wait, no, hold on.
Let me finish.

17:45.347 --> 17:48.179
Look, I'm not the kind of guy
women ever went for.

17:48.180 --> 17:50.879
I wish I was, but I'm-I'm not.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.646
Hell, I took a cousin
to my prom.

17:53.647 --> 17:55.846
And not even
a pretty cousin, either.

17:55.847 --> 17:57.879
I think she had, like,
a mild form

17:57.880 --> 17:59.979
of spina bifida or something.
I'm not kidding.

17:59.980 --> 18:02.512
And she ended up going to
second base with another cousin.

18:02.513 --> 18:05.046
The whole situation
was really dark, honestly.

18:05.047 --> 18:08.479
But anyway, you came along,
and you were so beautiful

18:08.480 --> 18:11.012
and so cool, and-and...

18:11.013 --> 18:14.212
you made the insane choice
of actually wanting me.

18:14.213 --> 18:16.212
And not just wanting me,

18:16.213 --> 18:18.446
going so far
as to trick me into marriage.

18:18.447 --> 18:20.512
I would have tricked a lot
of men into marriage, actually,

18:20.513 --> 18:21.879
so don't... flatter yourself.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.912
All right, well,
I'm trying to say that I...

18:23.913 --> 18:26.947
I didn't appreciate how fucking
amazing you are. How about that?

18:28.247 --> 18:30.012
Well, not as amazing as...

18:30.013 --> 18:32.046
Caitleen, right?

18:32.047 --> 18:33.379
Caitlyn. L-Y-N.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.212
I don't care.
I know, I know.

18:35.213 --> 18:39.146
I held Caitlin up
as this... ideal.

18:39.147 --> 18:40.712
But then I realized...

18:40.713 --> 18:42.146
That she's
a boring little bitch?

18:42.147 --> 18:45.612
Mm, no. I-I was gonna say that
I realized that she's not you.

18:45.613 --> 18:47.046
And that she's
a boring little bitch.

18:47.047 --> 18:49.479
Okay. But compared to you...

18:49.480 --> 18:50.579
Compared to anyone.

18:50.580 --> 18:52.846
I kind of need you to say it.

18:52.847 --> 18:55.279
Um... yeah,
she's a boring little bitch.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.979
I know, right?
Yeah.

18:56.980 --> 18:58.612
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

18:58.613 --> 19:01.180
You can come in now.
Okay. Thank you.

19:04.747 --> 19:06.046
We're done.

19:06.047 --> 19:07.547
Good as new.

19:10.447 --> 19:11.846
What's happening?

19:11.847 --> 19:13.779
Why am I crying?

19:13.780 --> 19:16.412
Sometimes patients
coming off anesthesia

19:16.413 --> 19:18.246
exhibit strong emotions.

19:18.247 --> 19:19.679
You're gonna be okay.
Am I?

19:19.680 --> 19:22.246
Am I gonna be okay?

19:22.247 --> 19:24.646
Why did I just ask you that?

19:24.647 --> 19:28.012
What is happening to me?
Oh, fuck.

19:28.013 --> 19:29.213
Oh, God.

19:31.013 --> 19:32.779
So, this is normal?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.413
Mm-hmm.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.879
Oh, God, I miss this place.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.213
It's our home.
Yeah.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.046
Another leg broke off?

19:49.047 --> 19:51.879
I know. And the springs have gone to shit.
Yeah.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.779
I was gonna get a
new one, but I just couldn't

19:54.780 --> 19:57.212
bring myself to give this one away.
Yeah.

19:57.213 --> 19:59.346
Lot of memories on that couch.

19:59.347 --> 20:01.712
It's where I first
gave you a blow job.

20:01.713 --> 20:04.112
I was just thinking that, yeah.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.779
We were watching <i>Chicago Fire,</i>

20:05.780 --> 20:07.712
and you said, "This
show is so stupid."

20:07.713 --> 20:09.779
It is. Right.
"Do you want a blow job?"

20:09.780 --> 20:10.912
And I... Do you
remember what I said?

20:10.913 --> 20:12.833
You were just like,
"Yes, please." "Yes, please."

20:13.247 --> 20:14.879
Because I did.
I did want...

20:14.880 --> 20:17.246
You hurt me, Doug. Jesus!
I'm sorry, Sarah.

20:17.247 --> 20:19.846
I'm so sorry. I know.
I'm such an idiot.

20:19.847 --> 20:23.179
If I could go back and if
I could take it all back...

20:23.180 --> 20:26.012
Hey, look at me...
I love you so much.

20:26.013 --> 20:28.479
I wouldn't have tricked
anybody else into marrying me.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.979
I just... I was
just lashing out.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.779
Really?
Yeah.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.912
Oh, come here.

20:34.913 --> 20:37.012
Oh.
Mmm.

20:37.013 --> 20:37.913
Oh!

20:39.947 --> 20:41.713
Oh, Sarah.

20:43.147 --> 20:44.912
Oh.

20:44.913 --> 20:46.812
I think that this is good.
I think this is great.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.380
Yeah.

20:49.847 --> 20:52.012
I just wish that we had
figured that out last week.

20:52.013 --> 20:53.746
I know. Each moment...

20:53.747 --> 20:56.279
Each moment is so precious;
I know that now.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.579
And every day that we
didn't spend together

20:58.580 --> 21:00.879
is-is a day lost in
the sands of time.

21:00.880 --> 21:04.079
Yeah. That's... true, I guess.
Yeah.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.180
Also, I had
an abortion last Friday.

21:07.813 --> 21:10.012
What? No, wait. What?

21:10.013 --> 21:13.380
I don't know, there <i> was</i> a baby,
and then there wasn't one.

21:16.113 --> 21:17.979
You had an-an abortion?

21:17.980 --> 21:19.212
Are you serious?

21:19.213 --> 21:21.512
Hey. Wh...

21:21.513 --> 21:23.412
Why didn't you tell me?

21:23.413 --> 21:26.446
I... I mean, I know
we'd broken up, but...

21:26.447 --> 21:28.112
it was mine, too.

21:28.113 --> 21:30.112
Uh...

21:30.113 --> 21:32.179
Are you okay?
What was that?

21:32.180 --> 21:33.446
Yeah. No.

21:33.447 --> 21:35.212
Was that a shrug?
Did you just shrug?

21:35.213 --> 21:36.979
It was a little...

21:36.980 --> 21:38.512
That's a shrug. Yeah,
that's a weird shrug.

21:38.513 --> 21:40.012
You know what, Doug?
I wasn't completely sure

21:40.013 --> 21:41.179
that it was yours, okay?

21:41.180 --> 21:42.846
I went on a bit of a spree.

21:42.847 --> 21:44.712
But you used protection.

21:44.713 --> 21:46.246
You know how I feel
about condoms, Doug.

21:46.247 --> 21:49.247
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

21:51.747 --> 21:53.112
Well...

21:53.113 --> 21:55.546
I'm gonna go get some Fresca.

21:55.547 --> 21:58.379
Do you want a Fresca?

21:58.380 --> 22:01.679
Um... no.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.447
Okay.

22:22.213 --> 22:23.846
Marty.

22:23.847 --> 22:26.012
I thought Dre had given you
the code. He's up at the house

22:26.013 --> 22:27.879
if you want to follow me in.
No, actually,

22:27.880 --> 22:30.912
I wanted to talk to you
for a second, if I could. May I?

22:30.913 --> 22:32.547
Y-Yeah.

22:36.580 --> 22:38.279
What's...

22:38.280 --> 22:40.012
What's going on, Marty?

22:40.013 --> 22:42.212
You seem...
Um...

22:42.213 --> 22:44.613
It's about Lukas.

22:46.147 --> 22:48.212
I can't prove anything,

22:48.213 --> 22:50.779
and I...

22:50.780 --> 22:53.646
I wouldn't say this
if I wasn't sure.

22:53.647 --> 22:55.913
Your husband had Lukas killed.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.646
You've never been in
a good relationship, have you?

23:06.647 --> 23:11.379
One where you really open
yourself up to that person,

23:11.380 --> 23:13.746
where you make...

23:13.747 --> 23:17.312
every important decision
together,

23:17.313 --> 23:20.313
good and bad.

23:25.780 --> 23:26.979
Jesus.

23:26.980 --> 23:30.679
Dre and I talk... a lot.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.613
Sometimes we even talk
about you.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.112
Maybe you should focus

23:37.113 --> 23:41.512
on trying to fix <i> your</i> shit,
instead of coming in here

23:41.513 --> 23:44.479
trying to fuck up
what Dre and I have.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.412
Because that is not

23:46.413 --> 23:48.880
going to happen.

23:50.947 --> 23:53.580
Good night, Marty.

24:15.013 --> 24:16.379
Hello.

24:16.380 --> 24:18.212
Jeremiah let me in.

24:18.213 --> 24:19.579
And then he went

24:19.580 --> 24:21.846
to Chantelle's.

24:21.847 --> 24:24.046
And I think Roscoe is...

24:24.047 --> 24:25.779
School field trip.

24:25.780 --> 24:27.612
Brought you a present.

24:27.613 --> 24:30.580
And I might've gotten
a teensy head start.

24:31.647 --> 24:33.480
Yeah?

24:34.913 --> 24:37.446
Hey, Jeannie, you
remember what happened

24:37.447 --> 24:39.612
last time we...
shared a bottle?

24:39.613 --> 24:41.680
Not really.

24:42.680 --> 24:45.212
Okay, uh, listen...

24:45.213 --> 24:48.646
today has been...

24:48.647 --> 24:50.579
I... I don't want
to end up doing

24:50.580 --> 24:52.379
something stupid.
I do.

24:52.380 --> 24:55.346
I want to do something
really fucking stupid.

24:55.347 --> 24:57.312
So why don't you get

24:57.313 --> 25:00.047
your big-boy pants on
and grab a glass.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.079
I seriously lost my shit.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.579
I-I could not
stop crying.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.312
I think it scared the dentist.

25:08.313 --> 25:10.612
Doesn't make sense.
I mean, you've been

25:10.613 --> 25:12.146
with hundreds of guys, right?

25:12.147 --> 25:14.428
Clearly, this can't be the
first one that's been murdered.

25:15.471 --> 25:17.312
I don't think it had anything
to do with Lukas.

25:17.313 --> 25:18.779
What was it?

25:18.780 --> 25:21.679
I don't know.
It's not important.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.846
Are you fucking kidding me?
What was it?

25:23.847 --> 25:25.413
Just tell me.

25:27.147 --> 25:29.079
What?
You finally make a friend,

25:29.080 --> 25:31.280
and he turns out
to be a murderer.

25:32.913 --> 25:34.413
That's not funny.

25:36.713 --> 25:38.747
Where the fuck is this thing?

25:40.480 --> 25:42.979
What are you doing?

25:42.980 --> 25:46.946
I am trying to take my bra off
without taking my blouse off.

25:46.947 --> 25:48.179
Why?

25:48.180 --> 25:50.713
'Cause it's sexy.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.912
No, no, I should
never have said it.

25:56.913 --> 25:58.812
I mean, I think it was just

25:58.813 --> 26:00.712
something about
being at the wedding

26:00.713 --> 26:02.579
or being in Vegas.
No, it's not...

26:02.580 --> 26:06.346
I mean... I just wasn't in a
place to hear it, you know?

26:06.347 --> 26:09.379
Not like I'm ever
really in a place to...

26:09.380 --> 26:11.446
to hear it, but...

26:11.447 --> 26:13.846
I'm glad you said it.

26:13.847 --> 26:15.446
I mean...

26:15.447 --> 26:17.913
I'm glad you felt it.

26:26.247 --> 26:28.279
That-that's
number one...

26:28.280 --> 26:30.679
best picture.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.679
Oh, my Lord.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.146
Uh-huh. And there's
this picture.

26:35.147 --> 26:36.579
Wow.

26:36.580 --> 26:38.346
My mom.
She was beautiful.

26:38.347 --> 26:41.313
Yeah. Graduation.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.212
Oh... God, I'm
such an asshole.

26:45.213 --> 26:47.146
I don't know, you did sacrifice

26:47.147 --> 26:49.246
your body last night
to protect me.

26:49.247 --> 26:51.046
Yeah, but I broke your tooth.

26:51.047 --> 26:52.247
I know, you asshole.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.312
<i>Hey.</i>

27:47.313 --> 27:50.179
What?

27:50.180 --> 27:52.247
I love you.

27:53.980 --> 27:56.746
Dummy, you were supposed
to say that before,

27:56.747 --> 27:59.346
to get me into bed, not after.

27:59.347 --> 28:01.580
I know, I fucked it up.
