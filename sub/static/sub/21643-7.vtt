00:13.146 --> 00:14.014
Hi, everybody.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.682
Welcome to Strain O' The Day.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.018
You've noticed we're a little dressed up.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.420
But if you haven't, come on, dude, focus.

00:21.654 --> 00:24.457
We're wearing fancy-ass gowns
with the tags still on

00:24.524 --> 00:26.192
in honor of today's strain...

00:26.493 --> 00:27.527
Prom Night.

00:27.594 --> 00:30.363
This sativa-dominant hybrid
has been specially engineered

00:30.430 --> 00:33.466
to recreate the way you felt
that magical evening in May.

00:33.533 --> 00:37.170
Young, giddy
and deeply curious about that hard lump

00:37.237 --> 00:39.205
pressed against you during the slow dance.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.174
[doorbell rings]

00:41.241 --> 00:42.475
Speaking of which...

00:42.675 --> 00:45.412
-our dates have arrived!
-Our dates have arrived!

00:47.547 --> 00:48.715
Hello, ladies.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.118
Pete, come on.

00:54.687 --> 00:57.457
Grew up on a commune,
I don't know what a prom is.

00:57.524 --> 00:59.159
[Jenny giggles]

00:59.225 --> 01:00.693
Wow, sweet threads.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.563
You two look like
the coolest dudes in school.

01:04.563 --> 01:07.567
Yeah. I know you only asked me out
because I'm dying,

01:07.634 --> 01:09.069
but I'm okay with that.

01:11.671 --> 01:12.605
What's happening?

01:13.373 --> 01:14.240
Stop it.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.409
So, did you guys, like, bring it?

01:16.476 --> 01:19.212
[laughs] Oh. We sure did.

01:19.679 --> 01:23.283
-[Olivia] Ooh.
-[Jenny] Aah.

01:23.349 --> 01:26.119
It matches my dress.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.788
And Prom Night is only $50 an eighth.

01:28.855 --> 01:32.325
So, you'll have money left over
to buy that morning-after pill.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.330
We're definitely getting some tonight.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.500
We have some right here,
but they're wearing it

01:40.567 --> 01:42.268
-and I still don't know why.
-Pete.

01:44.237 --> 01:45.305
Hi, kids.

01:45.371 --> 01:48.508
You didn't think you were getting away
without pictures, did you?

01:49.275 --> 01:51.377
[both] Oh, Mom.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.747
Hi, Mrs. Whitefeather Feldman
from Ruth's Alternative Caring.

01:54.814 --> 01:56.149
Hi, Mr. Carter.

01:56.683 --> 01:57.550
You two...

01:58.218 --> 02:00.854
what are your intentions
regarding my daughters?

02:02.388 --> 02:04.757
Sir... we intend to get them high.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.693
[Travis] On Prom Night.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.662
[both] We approve!

02:09.729 --> 02:11.898
[all laughing]

02:15.435 --> 02:18.571
But if either of you sons of bitches
lays a finger on my daughters...

02:19.172 --> 02:19.906
I'll shoot you dead.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.246
I am so fucking serious right now.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.250
No, I'm messing with you, boys.
Screw them senseless!

02:30.316 --> 02:31.451
[all chuckle]

02:31.518 --> 02:33.219
[both] Thanks, Dad.

02:33.686 --> 02:34.587
Prom Night.

02:34.888 --> 02:38.191
Share it with someone you'll stalk
on Facebook in 20 years.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.609
-So, what am I looking at here?
-It's Leafly.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.479
It's a website and an app.
It's Yelp for pot.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.516
It's a place where customers
can post reviews on our store.

03:04.183 --> 03:04.884
Here. Check it out.

03:07.253 --> 03:11.824
"Ruth's Alternative Caring is a great
dispensary and Ruth is the best."

03:12.392 --> 03:13.326
Wow.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.361
People on the Internet are really nice.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.197
[Olivia] Here's one.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.333
"I'm a high school math teacher

03:20.400 --> 03:23.736
and Ruth's Alternative Caring is
the only reason I haven't killed myself."

03:25.905 --> 03:28.308
We get a lot
of public school teachers in here

03:28.374 --> 03:29.576
who wanna leave the planet.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.981
I-- I like this, though.

03:35.248 --> 03:38.985
I mean, you know, Travis,
getting on Leafly, that was a good idea.

03:39.252 --> 03:39.919
Wait, really?

03:40.954 --> 03:43.623
Not, "It was a good idea for a sellout
with an MBA"?

03:43.690 --> 03:45.792
Also known as an MBA-hole. [chuckles]

03:47.293 --> 03:50.230
-Right?
-Ooh. That was good.

03:50.463 --> 03:53.933
Oh, man. MBA-hole.
Where was that during the Scrabble game?

03:56.269 --> 03:58.938
No, no, but seriously, it's a good idea.

03:59.005 --> 04:02.308
Well, to be fair, Olivia's the one
who made the Leafly thing happen.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.309
She's the real hero.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.711
Oh, I'm no hero.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.281
Just a humble pot-store employee
who completed a task.

04:09.449 --> 04:10.750
Oh, hey, I guess I am a hero.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.687
Wow, this is the good stuff.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.690
All of us working together again.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.793
You know?
No more of that needless infighting.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.496
We're all on the same team finally.

04:23.563 --> 04:24.897
Team Me.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.837
Although, seriously, I still do wish
the two of you were fucking.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.542
What?

04:43.583 --> 04:44.617
Hi-yah!

04:44.884 --> 04:45.752
Two boards.

04:45.818 --> 04:46.953
[chuckles]

04:47.020 --> 04:47.954
Impressive.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.024
It seems the student has become...

04:52.325 --> 04:53.059
a better student.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.029
Only because the teacher
has become the teacher

04:56.296 --> 04:58.731
of the student who learned what I learned.

05:00.566 --> 05:01.467
Wise words.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.904
-Have you been practicing your meditation?
-No.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.607
Good. You should never do that
without a spotter.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.009
[grunting]

05:12.812 --> 05:13.680
Fast.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.316
Yeah.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.786
Well, my lunch break's over,
I should probably head back.

05:19.852 --> 05:21.087
You got kids, Pete, huh?

05:21.354 --> 05:22.422
You a family man?

05:22.855 --> 05:24.824
-No.
-Yeah, I am, too.

05:25.792 --> 05:26.959
Three girls.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.395
Of whom I have sole custody.

05:29.696 --> 05:30.697
On weekends.

05:32.031 --> 05:35.501
No son, though. No... heir apparent.

05:36.069 --> 05:40.039
No one to take this studio over
when I'm in my Tae Kwon Dotage.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.742
What about your girls?

05:42.809 --> 05:44.844
No. [laughs] No.

05:45.478 --> 05:49.482
They wanna be a princess, a unicorn
and an arts administrator.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.751
Three imaginary jobs.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.621
Besides,
dojangs are traditionally handed down

05:55.688 --> 05:57.957
from father to son in the Korean culture.

05:58.591 --> 05:59.892
That's according to Wikipedia.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.729
Well, again, I should--

06:02.795 --> 06:06.532
You know, I've long sought a young protégé
to be that surrogate son.

06:06.599 --> 06:10.403
But alas... I've found no one among
my students with the purity of heart

06:10.470 --> 06:14.407
and the ease of self to carry on
the Intensity Plus legacy.

06:15.842 --> 06:16.876
I have an idea.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.144
Yes, Pete?

06:18.778 --> 06:20.880
Maybe I could help you...

06:22.582 --> 06:24.617
hand out those 10-percent-off coupons.

06:26.652 --> 06:27.854
That's what got me in here.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.823
Hey. Good to see you.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.042
That review there. Read that.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.613
"Everyone at Ruth's is great,
but I particularly love Jenny.

06:53.946 --> 06:58.151
Not only did she set me up with some
kick-ass Frosted Mini Weed cereal...

06:58.885 --> 07:02.588
she's chill, funny
and radiates a beautiful sadness."

07:05.057 --> 07:07.126
Beautiful sadness?
What does that look like?

07:08.795 --> 07:09.962
[exhales]

07:13.466 --> 07:15.635
-That is spot-on. Yeah.
-Wow, just devastating.

07:16.669 --> 07:19.639
You need to figure out
who this "Lah-doo-day" is.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.041
I think it's "L.A. Dude."

07:23.743 --> 07:25.445
It doesn't matter what his name is.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.914
All that matters is,
I haven't had sex in 11 months.

07:28.981 --> 07:29.949
[sighs]

07:32.652 --> 07:34.687
Oh, God, we have to find him.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.023
Preferably before 2:45,
I gotta go pick up my kids.

07:37.924 --> 07:38.925
Hey, Carter.

07:38.991 --> 07:42.061
We keep security footage of everyone
who comes in the store, right?

07:45.698 --> 07:46.566
Roger that.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.536
So, we could go back through it
and figure out

07:50.603 --> 07:52.805
who bought a box
of Frosted Mini Weed from me.

07:52.872 --> 07:55.908
-Yeah, let's do it! It'll be fun.
-Okay, yeah, let's do it.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.211
Like private investigators,
solving a mystery.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.813
I'll be the boss
and y'all the three lady detectives.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.682
Carter's Angels. No, no, no.

08:03.049 --> 08:03.916
Charlie's Carters.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.254
-No! Magnum, P.I.!
-He is so fucking high right now.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.492
I can't even follow. [chuckles]

08:29.909 --> 08:30.776
Hello, Pete.

08:30.843 --> 08:31.711
Hey, Ruth.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.212
That didn't scare you?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.916
Oh, crap,
I knew I should have swiveled faster.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.119
Is, uh, everything okay?

08:40.720 --> 08:41.754
You tell me.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.856
You're the self-defense expert.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.526
[scoffs] I wouldn't call myself an expert.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.895
I've just been taking classes
from Tae Kwon Doug.

08:49.228 --> 08:52.532
Oh, is that your story?
'Cause here's what I think.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.035
I think you've been taking classes
from Tae Kwon Doug.

08:59.605 --> 09:02.174
In a sense... we're both right.

09:04.010 --> 09:07.647
Pete, Tae Kwon Doug tried
to have us shut down.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.717
He had me arrested for the simple act
of jumping off a truck on top of him,

09:11.784 --> 09:12.985
plus some light punching.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.023
I mean, what are you doing
giving him your business?

09:17.089 --> 09:19.759
I'm not giving him any money.
He's teaching me for free.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.261
I think it's more of a friendship thing.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.232
You two are friends?

09:28.801 --> 09:29.802
Sure.

09:30.236 --> 09:34.974
So... if you threw a party
and you invited all your friends,

09:35.041 --> 09:36.275
he would be at that party?

09:36.909 --> 09:38.144
If he were available.

09:40.746 --> 09:44.784
And, uh, if-- If you needed help moving
and he had a pickup truck,

09:44.850 --> 09:46.953
you'd consider paying him in pizza?

09:47.019 --> 09:49.055
Yeah, although he's lactose-intolerant.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.225
You know he's lactose-intolerant?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.596
He shared that with you?

09:57.697 --> 10:01.267
Well, what's the big deal?
He's just my Tae Kwon Do teacher.

10:02.335 --> 10:07.373
Well, since he's such a good teacher...
maybe you can demonstrate on me.

10:08.040 --> 10:13.312
Okay? I'm gonna open my mouth
and using your exciting new techniques...

10:14.680 --> 10:17.783
reach in with your arm
and rip my heart out.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.289
See now, that sounds advanced.
I just started.

10:26.025 --> 10:29.028
Pete, I think we always knew
that it would come to this.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.897
Ever since I visited
your family's compound,

10:31.964 --> 10:34.100
I saw you suckling
at your mother's breast,

10:34.166 --> 10:38.904
you were happy, innocent...
barely 6 years old.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.342
And you looked at me and you said, "Hi."

10:43.409 --> 10:45.244
Heh. Yeah, that sounds like me.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.748
That's not what you meant.

10:49.181 --> 10:53.653
What you meant was,
"One day I'm gonna rip your heart out

10:53.719 --> 10:56.055
and throw it on the floor
in front of you."

10:58.124 --> 10:59.392
Well, that day has come.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.062
So, go ahead. Reach in, take what's yours.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.807
That's not him. He's not looking at Jenny.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.809
Actually, he's hot, though, so hold on.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.745
Stop. Rewind.
Let me see him at regular speed.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.150
Ew! He's not hot at regular speed!

11:25.351 --> 11:27.686
Ah! Real time is not his friend!

11:29.155 --> 11:32.224
This is gonna take forever.
We have to narrow it down.

11:32.291 --> 11:35.361
Wait, the guy wrote
Jenny sold him Frosted Mini Weed, right?

11:35.995 --> 11:39.732
That's on the top shelf of the fridge.
Look for Jenny reaching into that shelf.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.301
[laughs] Olivia, you are not helping.

11:45.171 --> 11:48.174
Jenny, does someone like you
really need to date some rando?

11:48.240 --> 11:51.010
Why not? A rando's just a guy
you haven't fucked yet.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.947
God, that-- That's beautiful.

11:56.315 --> 12:00.119
How about you, Carter? I bet
you've been to the rando rodeo before,

12:00.186 --> 12:02.455
if you know what I'm saying! [laughs]

12:03.489 --> 12:04.957
I do know what you're saying.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.092
Please stop.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.495
Ah! You sly dog.

12:09.762 --> 12:10.729
[chuckles]

12:12.031 --> 12:13.432
All right, I guess it's my turn.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.869
-No. We're not-- There's no turns.
-It was tenth grade.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.439
I was on a school trip
to Colonial Williamsburg.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.875
Little did I know
that an apprentice blacksmith

12:22.942 --> 12:27.379
was about to pound this innocent wench
into womanhood.

13:24.003 --> 13:27.173
We cavorted in the hayloft
for nigh on 20 minutes,

13:27.239 --> 13:29.375
and then he screamed, "Odds bodkins!"

13:29.975 --> 13:33.279
And that's when I knew
I had become a woman.

13:37.183 --> 13:40.019
Vape drop. Pew! [clicks tongue]

13:43.155 --> 13:47.493
[singing] ♪  Wish there was a song
About being sad ♪

13:50.129 --> 13:55.501
♪ I wish there was a song
About being sad right now ♪

13:56.535 --> 13:58.504
♪ 'Cause I'd sing it on the roof ♪

13:59.838 --> 14:01.507
♪ Yeah, I'd sing it on the roof ♪

14:04.843 --> 14:05.611
You sad?

14:08.113 --> 14:09.915
God, you know me so well.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.921
Mom gave you
the whole "rip my heart out" speech, huh?

14:15.988 --> 14:17.623
-That's a thing?
-Oh, yeah.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.525
I've ripped her heart out many times.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.362
I've also pecked at her liver...
poisoned her womb.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.365
In high school,
I gave her stage V soul cancer.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.104
I don't understand how I was disloyal.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.207
I'm just taking free lessons
from Tae Kwon Douglas.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.877
She's afraid you'll choose him over her.

14:37.943 --> 14:40.145
When she got out of jail,
I stayed with my dad,

14:40.212 --> 14:43.015
she gave the whole speech,
didn't talk to me for a year.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.252
I didn't talk for a year once.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.221
It was my first year.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.898
So... should I stop taking lessons
from Douglas?

14:58.964 --> 15:01.500
What? You don't need to quit
'cause of what my mom thinks.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.203
And you need to tell her that.
Stand up to her.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.671
I'll go with you if it helps.

15:07.539 --> 15:11.143
Okay, thanks.
Just give me a few more minutes here.

15:11.977 --> 15:12.678
Take your time.

15:18.517 --> 15:22.621

15:45.010 --> 15:46.946
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Look at this.

15:47.012 --> 15:51.050
There's Jenny getting Frosted Mini Weed
for the guy with the motorcycle helmet.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.452
[Olivia] Oh, my God, he's hot.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.220
And he's checking out your ass.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.324
[Jenny] Yeah, baby.
Beautiful sadness in the front,

15:58.390 --> 16:00.526
[singsong] party in the back.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.529
[Maria] A motorcycle helmet, I like it.

16:03.595 --> 16:07.166
It says, "I'm cool,
but I don't want a brain injury."

16:09.535 --> 16:13.639
[Carter] Whoa, okay, look, it seems like
your future husband knows Dank and Dabby.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.174
[Jenny] Oh, great.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.744
Maybe they're not friends.
Maybe they just met.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.985
[inaudible dialogue]

16:29.021 --> 16:30.723
-[Olivia] That took some practice.
-[Carter] Mm-hm.

16:31.357 --> 16:35.461
[Maria] It's like they're on a team
and they're celebrating sports points.

16:36.729 --> 16:40.032
Well, I don't care if he's friends
with them. I can change him.

16:40.099 --> 16:43.469
The point is, he knows Dank and Dabby,
so we can just ask them.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.170
Ah! Yes, you're right.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.439
Charlie's Carters has a lead.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.153
[knocking on door]

17:01.587 --> 17:03.589
[Travis] Mom, it's me and Pete.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.325
Uh, just a second.

17:09.094 --> 17:10.762
Uh, send Pete in first.

17:16.035 --> 17:16.702
[Pete yelps]

17:19.238 --> 17:22.374
No, no, no.
That was my happy-to-see-you swivel.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.510
It felt very aggressive.

17:26.645 --> 17:30.249
Mom... Pete has something
he'd like to say to you.

17:30.315 --> 17:32.251
No, no. I wanna say something first.

17:32.751 --> 17:34.186
Pete, I'm sorry.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.790
How could you know you were forbidden
to see Tae Kwon Doug?

17:38.524 --> 17:40.559
You-- You didn't know. But now you do.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.062
You're forbidden
from seeing Tae Kwon Doug.

17:44.596 --> 17:45.697
He's a shit bird.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.634
So, we cool?

17:49.568 --> 17:51.203
-I guess.
-Great.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.638
Welcome back to Team Me.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.440
Oh, no, no, no. [gibbers]

17:56.108 --> 17:56.775
Pete?

17:58.644 --> 17:59.511
Ruth...

18:00.746 --> 18:04.583
I would like to continue taking lessons
from Tae Kwon Douglas.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.619
I see.

18:08.253 --> 18:11.723
Well... I suppose this is good timing.

18:12.357 --> 18:13.225
'Cause I, uh...

18:14.126 --> 18:15.527
I just had a boba tea and...

18:16.195 --> 18:18.297
my esophagus is nicely lubed so you can...

18:20.432 --> 18:22.367
reach right in and rip my heart out!

18:22.801 --> 18:24.803
-No, no.
-No. All right?

18:24.870 --> 18:26.371
No. No bullying people.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.607
All right?
Especially when they're sensitive.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.175
Hey. Here you go, buddy.

18:30.242 --> 18:32.311
-[gasping]
-Yeah. Yeah.

18:33.145 --> 18:33.812
Yeah.

18:36.181 --> 18:38.750
Look at what you've done to Pete.
He can barely smoke weed.

18:43.689 --> 18:44.590
Pete.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.692
Pete, Pete, Pete.

18:47.359 --> 18:48.327
Come on, be honest.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.829
You really like taking those lessons?

18:52.731 --> 18:56.168
No, but... I do like Douglas.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.906
Well, do you promise
to like me better than him?

19:05.344 --> 19:06.211
Uh...

19:07.212 --> 19:08.447
Just say yes and go!

19:09.448 --> 19:10.315
Go!

19:15.754 --> 19:17.356
[Dabby] Yeah, that's definitely us.

19:17.422 --> 19:20.726
Yeah, you can tell
because that's her and that's me.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.494
[laughs] You're so smart.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.498
But this guy with the motorcycle helmet
who wants to marry me, who's he?

19:26.565 --> 19:27.466
[grunts]

19:27.900 --> 19:29.334
What do you mean, "ugh"?

19:29.401 --> 19:31.937
What part of "ugh" don't you understand?

19:32.571 --> 19:34.773
Wait, hold on a second, you guys.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.377
This guy looks a lot
like my cousin Paul...

19:39.178 --> 19:41.613
who died 13 years ago.

19:43.649 --> 19:46.919
Oh, shit. We hugged a ghost!

19:47.519 --> 19:51.223
-Oh, my God. Boo.
-Whoa! Boo...

19:51.290 --> 19:54.259
So, you guys have no idea who that guy is?

19:54.326 --> 19:55.761
You're hugging him
like best friends.

19:55.827 --> 19:56.828
[laughs]

19:56.895 --> 20:00.866
Carter, do you have any idea
how many humans, animals and plants

20:00.933 --> 20:02.534
we hug in a given day?

20:02.601 --> 20:03.502
Thirty-two.

20:03.902 --> 20:06.271
One for each day of Black History Month.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.843
Come on, you have to know something
about this guy.

20:11.910 --> 20:15.847
Yeah, 'cause he's not just any guy.
That's L.A. Dude. That's her soul mate.

20:15.914 --> 20:19.685
Well, I mean, if he's your soul mate,
then you just have to trust in destiny.

20:19.751 --> 20:22.254
Yeah. That's how we met.
At Stanford Medical School.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.222
[giggles]

20:24.723 --> 20:27.693
You went to Stanford Med School?
I was wait-listed there.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.561
-Well, they just let us right in.
-Mm-hm.

20:33.532 --> 20:36.735
[man over PA]  Okay. That concludes
the Cannabis Tolerance Study.

20:36.802 --> 20:37.936
Can we clear the smoke?

20:39.271 --> 20:41.640
[vacuum blowing]

21:01.827 --> 21:02.928
Get on my back.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.534
Oh, wait, that wasn't us.
We met at Pollo Loco. [laughs]

21:10.636 --> 21:12.437
Oh, you're right.

21:12.504 --> 21:15.307
-That place has soda!
-Mmm!

21:15.374 --> 21:17.609
-Nom, nom, nom...
-[moaning]

21:20.912 --> 21:23.815
[announcer]  Looking for a revolutionary
shaving experience?

21:23.882 --> 21:27.819
Try Cannafoam, the first ever
cannabis-infused shaving cream.

21:28.720 --> 21:33.325
Cannafoam's unique blend of emollients,
moisturizers and THC

21:33.392 --> 21:36.061
transforms your straight,
rigid, inflexible facial hair...

21:36.328 --> 21:37.829
[hair] We'll conquer your face!

21:37.896 --> 21:40.632
...into docile, tranquil strands
of compliant stubble

21:40.699 --> 21:43.702
too dazed to offer resistance
to the blade.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.538
Shave with the grain, against the grain,

21:46.605 --> 21:49.808
or just tell the hair there's
something cool you saw in the sink.

21:49.875 --> 21:50.742
Let's go!

21:50.809 --> 21:53.679
You'll be rewarded with the closest shave
you've ever had.

21:53.745 --> 21:54.813
Ooh. Sexy.

21:55.947 --> 21:59.551
[giggling] Oh, my God,
you touched my face.

22:07.359 --> 22:08.393
Cannafoam.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.862
Available wherever cannabis
shaving products are sold.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.969
You know, we can keep looking
if you want.

22:19.438 --> 22:22.474
That's okay.
Maybe he'll come back in again.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.510
And if he doesn't,
I'm sure you'll find somebody else.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.479
'Cause you're pretty great.

22:29.381 --> 22:30.582
Thanks, Carter.

22:32.017 --> 22:37.823
You know... I'm pretty good
at spotting chemistry between people.

22:37.889 --> 22:38.757
And, uh...

22:39.624 --> 22:43.361
Jenny, you and L.A. Dude have it!

22:58.043 --> 22:59.778
My self is centered.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.048
My self is centered.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.118
My self is centered.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.855
Okay, I'm self-centered.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.428
Doug.

23:20.966 --> 23:21.867
Ruth.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.436
Doug.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.573
[sighs] Ruth.

23:31.676 --> 23:33.445
We need to talk about Pete.

23:33.779 --> 23:35.580
Oh, you mean my new student?

23:35.914 --> 23:39.117
I mean my employee...
whom I've known since he was 6.

23:39.751 --> 23:40.719
Six, huh?

23:41.787 --> 23:42.654
That's, um...

23:43.755 --> 23:45.423
[voice breaking] That's an adorable age.

23:48.493 --> 23:49.461
Yeah, it is.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.897
And I make it my mission...

23:57.969 --> 23:59.571
to protect and guide him.

24:03.074 --> 24:07.546
I don't suppose you've heard much
about his, uh... odd family background.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.215
Oh, yeah, he's painted quite a picture.

24:10.482 --> 24:13.852
Frolicking through the marijuana fields
in hemp diapers.

24:15.453 --> 24:19.524
With all his many mothers and fathers,
also in hemp diapers.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.028
You don't get to judge.

24:23.728 --> 24:25.597
You weren't there. I was there.

24:25.931 --> 24:27.599
It was a fucking freak show.

24:29.701 --> 24:33.738
How someone could emerge from that
with such a pure soul is beyond me.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.508
I agree.

24:38.476 --> 24:41.847
You know, nothing or no one
should ever hurt that boy.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.082
You're right.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.955
Maybe you and I aren't
so different after all.

24:51.056 --> 24:53.792
No, we're extremely different.
In every way.

24:53.859 --> 24:56.228
Gender, height, worldview.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.230
Also, I can eat cheese.

25:02.033 --> 25:04.102
He told you about my lactose intolerance.

25:05.036 --> 25:07.172
Well, I'll have you know
there are soy cheeses

25:07.239 --> 25:09.207
that you'd swear were the genuine article.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.810
-You get nothing in here. You just eat--
-Never mind.

25:13.545 --> 25:17.983
The point is, you're Pete's friend...
and he enjoys your company.

25:18.617 --> 25:22.754
So... I approve that you give him lessons.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.124
Even though he doesn't need my approval.

25:30.295 --> 25:31.763
Well, okay. Huh.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.169
Hey, Ruth?

25:39.070 --> 25:39.938
Yeah, Doug?

25:41.139 --> 25:44.809
You see that pretzel shop that opened up
next to Keychain Heaven?

25:44.876 --> 25:47.212
Ugh. Artisanal mustards?

25:47.279 --> 25:49.848
-Yeah, that's gonna pack them in.
-I know.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.260
You guys still open?

26:03.128 --> 26:04.129
If you're fast.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.665
Can I get a box of Frosted Mini Weed?

26:06.731 --> 26:07.599
Sure.

26:08.099 --> 26:10.602
Thanks. I just need it
before I leave town tomorrow.

26:10.669 --> 26:11.603
Where you headed?

26:11.670 --> 26:13.805
Taipei. Moving there to teach English.

26:13.872 --> 26:14.806
That's cool.

26:15.006 --> 26:15.874
Like they say...

26:16.241 --> 26:19.144
[in Taiwanese]
Life is all about timing.

26:20.979 --> 26:22.747
[Jenny in English]
Hey, Travis! I'm leaving!

26:22.814 --> 26:25.250
I'm going out the back door tonight
for the first time ever.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.052
Just to see what it's like!

26:29.220 --> 26:30.188
Okay.

26:31.122 --> 26:32.590
Yeah, so that'll be $20.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.759
-There you go. Thanks.
-Thanks.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.028
Hey, enjoy your last night in L.A., dude.
