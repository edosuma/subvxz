00:13.716 --> 00:14.349
Hey.

00:14.373 --> 00:15.571
Hey.

00:15.572 --> 00:16.804
Closed door?

00:16.806 --> 00:19.039
I want to talk to you.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.608
Talk to or talk at?

00:20.610 --> 00:21.942
Probably nothing.

00:21.944 --> 00:24.078
Well, maybe nothing.
So something.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.480
Got a call from one of
our COs this morning.

00:26.482 --> 00:28.749
Turns out one of our cops
got his nose broken

00:28.751 --> 00:30.951
busting up a bar fight
on the upper east side.

00:30.953 --> 00:32.152
Okay, that happened.

00:32.154 --> 00:34.154
Thing is, the perp
in the incident

00:34.156 --> 00:36.223
is Alex Jasper.
Not ringing a bell.

00:36.225 --> 00:38.058
Son of Frederick T. Jasper.

00:38.060 --> 00:40.027
The mayor's main bundler?
The same.

00:40.029 --> 00:40.860
Oh.

00:40.884 --> 00:42.396
Normally, you
hit a cop,

00:42.397 --> 00:43.630
you break his nose,

00:43.632 --> 00:45.532
the judge hits you
with a hefty bail.

00:45.534 --> 00:46.766
I'm guessing that
didn't happen here.

00:46.768 --> 00:48.501
Released on his
own recognizance.

00:48.503 --> 00:49.802
I see.

00:49.804 --> 00:51.504
And this comes
to me because...

00:51.506 --> 00:53.039
Because should we
tell the boss?

00:53.041 --> 00:54.941
We?

00:54.943 --> 00:56.976
Well, now that you know
the particulars, yeah.

00:56.978 --> 01:00.513
Crafty. Two minutes ago
I was blissfully ignorant.

01:00.515 --> 01:01.781
Should we tell the boss?

01:01.783 --> 01:02.782
Is there any evidence that says

01:02.784 --> 01:04.617
the mayor talked
to that judge?

01:04.619 --> 01:05.918
Well, no, but it's
pretty obvious

01:05.920 --> 01:06.953
what's going on here.

01:06.955 --> 01:09.288
We don't say anything
to Frank

01:09.290 --> 01:10.456
until there's something to say.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.158
Are you sure?

01:17.698 --> 01:18.664
Morning.

01:18.666 --> 01:20.466
Hey, Danny.
Morning.

01:20.468 --> 01:21.734
- Morning, Regan.
- Morning.

01:21.736 --> 01:22.485
I got to tell him?

01:22.509 --> 01:23.803
You're the one
bringing it here.

01:23.804 --> 01:25.537
He's always pissed
about something.

01:25.539 --> 01:27.038
Get ready.
Heard 'em talking

01:27.040 --> 01:28.774
about a double
homicide came in.

01:28.776 --> 01:30.276
You mean the one they just gave
to Byrne and Bitterman?

01:30.278 --> 01:31.910
They're not gonna give
it to those bananas

01:31.912 --> 01:34.012
while we're sitting around
twiddling our thumbs.

01:34.014 --> 01:35.546
Well, we're no longer twiddling.

01:36.316 --> 01:38.349
Who's this,
and why is his foot

01:38.351 --> 01:40.418
on the furniture?

01:40.420 --> 01:42.087
Officer Mahoney.
How you doing?

01:42.089 --> 01:43.155
Just came off this job.

01:43.157 --> 01:44.322
- Sarge said to give it to you.
- What is it?

01:44.324 --> 01:46.324
Teen suicide.
You got to be kidding me.

01:46.326 --> 01:47.286
It's busy work.

01:47.310 --> 01:48.795
Hey, I'm just
the messenger.

01:48.796 --> 01:50.796
You're not just the messenger.
You're first on the scene, right?

01:50.798 --> 01:53.798
What do you know about
this Derrick Madigan kid?

01:53.800 --> 01:55.966
He's a good kid, just got
mixed up with the wrong crowd.

01:55.968 --> 01:58.202
What's that got to do with him
taking his own life?

01:58.204 --> 02:00.204
I think he got
peer-pressured by his friends.

02:00.206 --> 02:01.806
He was a lookout for one of
their robberies the other night.

02:01.808 --> 02:04.108
Once he heard we caught
wind of his involvement,

02:04.110 --> 02:05.410
well, word on
the street is

02:05.412 --> 02:06.877
he panicked.

02:06.879 --> 02:08.745
How'd he do it?

02:08.747 --> 02:11.548
His mother found him handing
by his belt in the closet.

02:11.550 --> 02:13.217
Oh, good Lord.

02:13.219 --> 02:15.152
As you can imagine, she ain't
doing so good right about now.

02:15.154 --> 02:16.787
Yeah, I wouldn't think so.

02:17.924 --> 02:19.957
So, uh, what can I
tell the boss?

02:19.959 --> 02:21.292
Tell the boss
we'll take the case

02:21.294 --> 02:23.794
and to teach you
some manners.

02:23.796 --> 02:25.495
Again with the foot!

02:27.098 --> 02:28.064
All right.
Yeah, all right.

02:28.066 --> 02:29.433
We got it from
here, good-bye.

02:31.036 --> 02:32.369
It was all you,
Your Majesty.

02:32.371 --> 02:34.871
Come on, we're a team.
When I win, you win.

02:34.873 --> 02:37.207
I just happen
to win more often.

02:37.209 --> 02:39.576
Funny thing is,
you ain't kidding.

02:39.578 --> 02:41.577
Oh, come on,
of course I am.

02:41.579 --> 02:42.678
You know that.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.181
There's a Reggie Wilson
here to see you.

02:45.183 --> 02:46.782
I don't see him
on your schedule.

02:46.784 --> 02:48.584
Reggie Wilson?
Sounds familiar.

02:48.586 --> 02:51.454
Wasn't he our
sole eyewitness

02:51.456 --> 02:52.956
on that homicide last year?

02:52.958 --> 02:54.991
Yeah, you're right.
He took the stand for us

02:54.993 --> 02:58.026
when the neighborhood
wouldn't even look our way.

02:58.028 --> 03:00.062
So I should let him in?
Please.

03:00.064 --> 03:01.797
He's got big stones,
this guy.

03:01.799 --> 03:04.767
By “stones” you're meaning
his intestinal fortitude?

03:04.769 --> 03:06.502
Sure. Whatever.

03:06.504 --> 03:08.671
Mr. Wilson.

03:08.673 --> 03:10.973
Miss Erin,
the pleasure's mine.

03:10.975 --> 03:12.908
Nice to see you.
Good to see you.

03:12.910 --> 03:14.376
Reggie, how are you?
Anthony, right?

03:14.378 --> 03:15.477
Look like you lost
some weight.

03:15.479 --> 03:18.113
I'll find it soon enough.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.848
So what brings you
all the way down here

03:19.850 --> 03:21.516
from the Bronx?

03:21.518 --> 03:23.418
I'm gonna be
straight with you.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.653
The way I see it,
I helped you out pretty good

03:25.655 --> 03:27.455
on that situation
you had last year.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.759
You did your civic duty,
for which we're grateful,

03:30.761 --> 03:31.793
if that's what you mean.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.428
Now it's your turn.

03:33.430 --> 03:34.962
My turn?

03:34.964 --> 03:37.164
It's your turn
to scratch my back.

03:42.906 --> 03:44.205
The dream team, sir.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.241
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:47.243 --> 03:48.575
How's it going, boss?
It's going.

03:48.577 --> 03:49.944
You see that piece
in the news?

03:49.946 --> 03:51.412
Nice little pat
on the back.

03:51.414 --> 03:53.781
In the neighborhood section,
page after the comics.

03:53.783 --> 03:55.616
Well, okay.

03:55.618 --> 03:57.684
I spoke to the Chief of D's,
like you asked.

03:57.686 --> 03:59.320
He says you're gonna
be very happy

03:59.322 --> 04:00.922
about this month's numbers.

04:00.924 --> 04:03.757
And you're personally
guaranteeing it?

04:03.759 --> 04:05.626
Well, no, I just...

04:05.628 --> 04:08.529
Better to under-promise
than over-deliver.

04:09.398 --> 04:11.264
Well, that's a good one.

04:13.368 --> 04:17.036
And what about
the Jasper kid's ROR?

04:21.276 --> 04:24.710
ROR, as in released
on own recognizance?

04:24.712 --> 04:26.112
As in no bail.

04:26.114 --> 04:27.247
I know what it means, sir.

04:27.249 --> 04:29.282
So you know about it, right?
Yeah.

04:29.284 --> 04:31.418
Yes, we just didn't know
you did.

04:31.420 --> 04:35.088
And you were about to tell me?
Because it's not in here.

04:35.090 --> 04:37.122
Well...
Look, I have dinner

04:37.124 --> 04:40.292
every Sunday with
the former PC, a detective,

04:40.294 --> 04:41.994
a beat cop, and an A.D.A.

04:41.996 --> 04:44.096
Did you really think
all my Intel

04:44.098 --> 04:45.197
flowed through you two?

04:45.199 --> 04:46.933
No, but...
I also charter

04:46.935 --> 04:50.202
a boat out of Montauk
from time to time

04:50.204 --> 04:52.839
with Officer Broken Nose's CO.

04:52.841 --> 04:57.142
Call in some chips and get
the presiding judge's phone log,

04:57.144 --> 05:00.112
and see who reached out.

05:00.114 --> 05:01.947
Now would be a good time.

05:15.295 --> 05:19.295

My kids are terrified

05:40.999 --> 05:42.465
to go to school.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.599
My wife,

05:43.601 --> 05:45.568
she's practically
turning into a hermit.

05:45.570 --> 05:48.104
All 'cause no one wants
to open our door.

05:48.106 --> 05:49.805
Your door opens up into the
lobby of the building?

05:49.807 --> 05:51.941
Ain't no lobby no
more, it's more like

05:51.943 --> 05:54.677
a 7-Eleven, with the only thing
on the shelves being dope.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.979
And how often
is this happening?

05:56.981 --> 05:59.715
24/7, 365.

06:00.885 --> 06:02.785
Hell, they've even closed it
down during Christmas morning.

06:02.787 --> 06:04.219
You've brought this
to the people

06:04.221 --> 06:05.855
that run the Housing
Authority?

06:05.857 --> 06:07.990
People that run the
Housing Authority? What?

06:07.992 --> 06:11.427
It's a housing project.
Nobody's running nothing.

06:11.429 --> 06:13.528
Have you reached out
to your local precinct?

06:13.530 --> 06:15.063
Only every day.

06:15.065 --> 06:18.233
And what'd they say?
“Call us back when there's a homicide”.

06:18.235 --> 06:19.734
The boogie down Bronx.

06:19.736 --> 06:22.570
And how about the Bronx D.A.?
Only every other day.

06:22.572 --> 06:23.173
What'd they say?

06:23.197 --> 06:24.874
“Call us back when
it's a homicide”.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.042
Look...

06:29.079 --> 06:31.245
I get it, okay?

06:31.247 --> 06:34.015
Up where we live,
doping and dealing,

06:34.017 --> 06:36.250
it ain't nothing to you people
down here in these buildings.

06:36.252 --> 06:39.086
But this is happening just
outside my door,

06:39.088 --> 06:40.922
and I don't want
that homicide

06:40.924 --> 06:42.824
to be one of my kids.

06:42.826 --> 06:48.129
Look... I get it,
and I want to help you.

06:48.131 --> 06:51.532
But I'm a Manhattan A.D.A.,
and you live in the Bronx.

06:51.534 --> 06:53.834
Didn't stop me
from helping you.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.844
Yeah, you're right.

07:04.980 --> 07:08.081
Okay, I will call the Bronx

07:08.083 --> 07:09.382
A.D.A.'s office.

07:09.384 --> 07:11.552
And I can't promise anything,

07:11.554 --> 07:13.620
but I will look into this.

07:14.423 --> 07:16.289
Thank you, Miss Erin.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.758
Thank you.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.093
Thank you. Thank you, Miss
Erin, thank you. Okay.

07:26.801 --> 07:28.901
I'd have put ten to one
against you agreeing

07:28.903 --> 07:30.470
to pick up this case.

07:30.472 --> 07:31.771
That's because you
don't know the history

07:31.773 --> 07:35.608
I have with a
certain Bronx A.D.A.

07:41.315 --> 07:42.882
I'm a good person.

07:42.884 --> 07:44.617
I've always tried
to do the right thing,

07:44.619 --> 07:48.053
even when life has dealt me
one crappy card after another.

07:48.055 --> 07:49.622
That person is gone now.

07:49.624 --> 07:51.591
Gone, gone.
We understand.

07:51.593 --> 07:53.258
We know you're hurting.

07:55.929 --> 07:58.897
Could you tell us some
more about Derrick?

07:58.899 --> 07:59.931
You want to know
about my son?

07:59.933 --> 08:01.166
Here's the only thing
you need

08:01.168 --> 08:03.135
to write down
on that piece of paper.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.437
Derrick was a blessing.

08:05.439 --> 08:06.805
He was heaven-sent.

08:06.807 --> 08:08.907
He was the only
good thing

08:08.909 --> 08:11.275
I ever got in my life,
and now he's just gone.

08:11.277 --> 08:13.411
Just like that.
How does that happen?

08:13.413 --> 08:15.146
I don't know.

08:15.148 --> 08:16.515
I can't imagine
what you're going through,

08:16.517 --> 08:19.117
but I lost a brother,
my partner lost a brother...

08:19.119 --> 08:20.284
Why did he do this?

08:20.286 --> 08:22.453
Why? Why would he take his life?

08:22.455 --> 08:24.523
Over something so stupid?

08:24.525 --> 08:27.025
Sometimes, we just don't know
how much someone is hurting...

08:27.027 --> 08:29.227
No, it's those idiots
he was running around with.

08:29.229 --> 08:30.428
That's whose fault this is.

08:30.430 --> 08:33.097
They made him do that robbery.

08:33.099 --> 08:34.865
I was telling Derrick
from day one,

08:34.866 --> 08:36.967
that boy Jonas is no good.

08:36.969 --> 08:38.269
I told him.

08:38.270 --> 08:39.736
Since the day that boy was born,

08:39.739 --> 08:41.772
He was no...

08:44.877 --> 08:47.077
I'm sorry.

08:56.722 --> 08:58.022
I'm sorry.

08:58.024 --> 08:59.789
It's okay.

09:00.992 --> 09:03.760
Take your time.

09:08.733 --> 09:10.467
Mr. Smith to see you.

09:10.469 --> 09:12.436
Hi. Nice to see you.

09:12.438 --> 09:14.237
I was happy that you
remembered me when I called.

09:14.239 --> 09:15.371
Oh, I never forget someone

09:15.373 --> 09:18.007
who tries to peddle influence
in my office.

09:18.009 --> 09:20.543
I was not trying
to influence you.

09:20.545 --> 09:23.479
You wanted me to drop charges
on your daughter

09:23.481 --> 09:25.915
when she was arrested
for drug possession.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.116
Now, what do you call that?

09:27.118 --> 09:29.619
Being a concerned mother.

09:29.621 --> 09:31.253
Okay.

09:31.255 --> 09:33.589
Speaking colleague to colleague,

09:33.591 --> 09:37.025
“Working out a mutually
beneficial arrangement.”

09:37.027 --> 09:38.894
What's the matter?

09:38.896 --> 09:40.829
Don't they give you
enough work to do down here?

09:40.831 --> 09:43.132
Mr. Wilson came to us.

09:43.134 --> 09:44.467
It was his idea.

09:44.469 --> 09:46.001
You're not twisting his arm?

09:46.003 --> 09:48.103
More like he's twisting mine.

09:48.105 --> 09:50.906
Well, tell him
it's starting to hurt.

09:50.908 --> 09:52.007
You're saying no?

09:52.009 --> 09:53.408
At least you're not dumb.

09:53.410 --> 09:55.043
No, I'm not.

09:55.045 --> 09:56.177
Cameron,

09:56.179 --> 09:57.646
can you come
in here, please?

10:01.852 --> 10:05.286
Could you put these
on the bottom of my pile?

10:10.059 --> 10:12.260
Okay, hold on.

10:12.262 --> 10:13.428
What are they?

10:13.430 --> 10:14.529
Oh, nothing really.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.632
Just all the cases your boss,
the Bronx D.A.,

10:17.634 --> 10:19.434
has requested our help with.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.643
Where do you want me to sign?

10:37.819 --> 10:40.320
I'm sure it'll just be a minute.

10:40.322 --> 10:42.489
Been 20.

10:47.363 --> 10:48.328
Excuse me.

10:48.330 --> 10:49.663
Will you kindly
tell the mayor

10:49.665 --> 10:51.097
that we have another
appointment this afternoon.

10:51.099 --> 10:52.332
Again, my apologies.

10:52.334 --> 10:54.300
I don't expect
it'll be much longer.

10:56.872 --> 10:59.338
She doesn't expect it
to be much longer.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.240
I have ears.

11:01.242 --> 11:03.376
Yes, of course you do.

11:05.213 --> 11:07.747
He does know we're
here, right?

11:07.749 --> 11:09.883
Yes, sir.

11:11.619 --> 11:14.487
Commissioner, so sorry
for making you wait.

11:19.427 --> 11:22.061
20 minutes, Carlton.

11:22.063 --> 11:23.796
Garrett,

11:23.798 --> 11:26.098
great to see you.
Please come in.

11:35.776 --> 11:38.510
Where's the mayor?

11:38.512 --> 11:40.879
Yes, about that.

11:40.881 --> 11:43.648
Commissioner, the mayor
extends his sincere apologies

11:43.650 --> 11:46.484
about not being able to meet
personally with you today.

11:46.486 --> 11:47.485
What?

11:47.487 --> 11:48.687
But he was called up to Albany

11:48.689 --> 11:51.789
on a last minute budget thing
with the governor.

11:54.628 --> 11:57.028
Did he leave out the window?

11:57.030 --> 11:58.663
Sorry, what?

11:58.665 --> 12:01.632
How long's he been gone?

12:01.634 --> 12:03.768
Since about 2:00.
We've been cooling

12:03.770 --> 12:06.070
our heels out there for almost
half an hour. The hell is this?

12:06.072 --> 12:07.872
This was a last minute
request for a meeting

12:07.874 --> 12:09.440
on an impossibly packed day

12:09.442 --> 12:12.043
that the mayor has authorized me
to take on his behalf.

12:12.045 --> 12:13.510
So, please, take a seat.

12:13.512 --> 12:14.912
I'm good.

12:14.914 --> 12:16.114
Okay, then.

12:16.116 --> 12:18.215
How can I help?

12:18.217 --> 12:22.253
You are authorized to speak
for the mayor, I got that right?

12:23.021 --> 12:25.088
Yes.
Okay.

12:25.090 --> 12:27.958
Just as if I were he.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.661
As if you were he.

12:30.663 --> 12:32.630
Okay.

12:35.567 --> 12:38.701
Then, Mr. Mayor,

12:38.703 --> 12:40.937
what the hell were you thinking

12:40.939 --> 12:42.338
when you personally phoned

12:42.340 --> 12:44.374
the presiding judge
in the Jasper case

12:44.376 --> 12:46.709
at 7:14 this morning

12:46.711 --> 12:50.480
and got bail squashed?

12:51.349 --> 12:54.950
I am not up to speed on this.

12:54.952 --> 12:57.487
Oh, you're not
up to speed on this, okay.

12:57.489 --> 12:59.989
Well, the son of one of your
biggest donors

12:59.991 --> 13:01.424
got ROR'd

13:01.426 --> 13:02.958
on a felony assault case

13:02.960 --> 13:05.961
for breaking the nose
of an NYPD officer,

13:05.963 --> 13:07.963
off your intercession.

13:07.965 --> 13:08.898
Uh-huh.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.766
Mr. Mayor,

13:10.768 --> 13:15.037
in what world
is that going to look okay?

13:19.677 --> 13:22.644
Garrett, I am going to have
to get back to you on this.

13:22.646 --> 13:24.613
Better be quick.

13:30.354 --> 13:33.355
“Can we talk” does not sound
like good news to me.

13:33.357 --> 13:34.856
I screwed up.

13:34.858 --> 13:35.857
Screwed up how?

13:35.859 --> 13:37.058
This is
Derrick Madigan.

13:37.060 --> 13:38.660
Our suicide.
Yeah,

13:38.662 --> 13:39.660
sort of.

13:39.662 --> 13:41.562
What do you mean sort of?

13:41.564 --> 13:43.431
I don't want this
to come out the wrong way,

13:43.433 --> 13:44.833
but can we keep this between us?

13:44.835 --> 13:45.867
Yeah, what happened?

13:45.869 --> 13:46.968
I was swamped.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.336
Had two of my people out sick

13:48.338 --> 13:50.404
and twice as many
incoming bodies as I usually do.

13:50.406 --> 13:52.506
Not to mention it's my third
double shift this week.

13:52.508 --> 13:54.075
Okay, so?

13:54.077 --> 13:56.009
I missed something.

13:56.011 --> 13:57.978
What'd you miss?

13:57.980 --> 13:59.613
Look under here.
At the hairline.

14:00.416 --> 14:01.682
Is that a bruise?

14:01.684 --> 14:04.184
Yeah. And over here.

14:04.186 --> 14:05.185
Same thing.

14:05.187 --> 14:07.822
More here and here.

14:07.824 --> 14:09.056
Those are bruises.

14:09.058 --> 14:11.425
Like from
somebody's hand, maybe?

14:12.661 --> 14:14.461
So, Derrick didn't hang himself.
Is that what you're saying?

14:14.463 --> 14:15.628
He was strangled.

14:15.630 --> 14:17.430
And then hung to make it
look like a suicide?

14:17.432 --> 14:18.932
Which means

14:18.934 --> 14:21.501
our suicide is now a homicide.

14:49.244 --> 14:51.044
Yo, yo, check it.
Casper the Friendly Ghost

14:51.046 --> 14:52.111
came to the projects.

14:52.113 --> 14:54.247
More like
the guy who ate Casper.

14:55.383 --> 14:57.115
You lost?

14:57.117 --> 14:58.417
'Cause in case
you ain't noticed,

14:58.419 --> 15:01.620
we ain't too friendly
around here.

15:01.622 --> 15:02.922
Look, I got a job inside.

15:02.924 --> 15:03.989
What kind of job?

15:03.991 --> 15:05.190
Busted pipe.

15:05.192 --> 15:06.625
You came here
for a busted pipe

15:06.627 --> 15:08.461
and left with a busted head.

15:09.214 --> 15:11.197
I'm not looking
for any problems.

15:11.198 --> 15:13.198
Just want to do my job.

15:26.213 --> 15:28.580
Yo, you eyeballing
something?

15:38.191 --> 15:39.557
Mr. Wilson?

15:39.559 --> 15:41.392
I got a work order here.

15:43.597 --> 15:46.263
Any problems getting in?

15:46.265 --> 15:48.932
I'm here, ain't I?

15:50.236 --> 15:51.502
My wife, Angela.

15:53.139 --> 15:54.338
Youngest, Trevor.

15:54.340 --> 15:55.672
Hi.

15:55.674 --> 15:57.041
My bigs are at school.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.209
We'll just be a minute.

16:00.213 --> 16:02.913
You see now
what I've been talking about?

16:02.915 --> 16:05.649
Worked overtime last night
and didn't make it back

16:05.651 --> 16:07.083
in time to get Trev
to school.

16:07.085 --> 16:08.385
He's staying home today

16:08.387 --> 16:09.486
because he's too scared

16:09.488 --> 16:11.655
to walk through
that nonsense without me.

16:11.657 --> 16:14.024
Oh, I understand.

16:14.026 --> 16:15.559
That little thing is a camera?

16:15.561 --> 16:17.027
Yeah, well,

16:17.029 --> 16:19.029
we won't want to let them know

16:19.031 --> 16:21.597
they're on <i>Candid Camera,</i>
now, would we?

16:22.467 --> 16:23.933
Well, is it working?

16:38.215 --> 16:39.782
Sure the hell is.

16:47.959 --> 16:49.825
Wait a sec. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:49.827 --> 16:51.193
What do you mean
he was murdered?

16:51.195 --> 16:53.362
He was murdered. I don't think
the kid strangled himself.

16:53.364 --> 16:55.330
What's the matter with you?
Why are you pissed off, huh?

16:55.332 --> 16:56.831
I didn't do nothing.
Because you're the one

16:56.833 --> 16:58.161
that brought us
this fleabag case.

16:58.162 --> 16:58.754
Fleabag case? It was

16:58.778 --> 16:59.835
murder, you just said.
Guys!

16:59.836 --> 17:01.103
Okay, focus.

17:01.105 --> 17:03.072
Look, you said earlier
that Derrick knew

17:03.074 --> 17:05.441
you guys were looking to
talk to him on that robbery.

17:05.443 --> 17:06.608
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

17:06.609 --> 17:07.876
So if he knew,
stands to reason

17:07.877 --> 17:09.210
the rest of his crew knew, too.

17:09.212 --> 17:10.612
Not too many secrets
on the street, no.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.280
You said that Derrick
was a good kid, right?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.583
He wasn't hard like the other
kids in the neighborhood?

17:14.585 --> 17:16.718
No, he was soft, like butter.
So, if you

17:16.720 --> 17:18.352
caught up to him, you think
you would've cracked him?

17:18.354 --> 17:20.387
He would've folded
like a house of cards.

17:20.390 --> 17:22.256
If you know that, then his crew
must know that, too.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.492
Oh, man.

17:25.861 --> 17:27.428
You think they silenced him.

17:27.430 --> 17:28.996
And made it look like a suicide.

17:28.998 --> 17:30.965
Derrick's mother said
something about this kid,

17:30.967 --> 17:32.266
Jonas. You know him?

17:32.268 --> 17:34.802
He supposedly got Derrick
mixed up in all this stuff.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.170
Yeah, they were always
hanging out together.

17:36.172 --> 17:37.205
Jonas was a lot faster

17:37.207 --> 17:39.039
than Derrick.
I wouldn't be surprised

17:39.041 --> 17:41.108
if he's the one that sucked him
into this whole mess.

17:41.110 --> 17:42.542
And maybe Jonas is the one

17:42.544 --> 17:44.778
who decided to
silence Derrick himself.

17:44.780 --> 17:46.113
You got a photo?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.251
Afternoon, Jonas.

17:51.253 --> 17:52.486
You two, keep walking.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.321
Come on, get
out of here.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.990
Who are you?

17:55.992 --> 17:58.258
Detective Reagan.
That's Detective Baez.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.059
And I don't have anything
to say to you.

18:00.061 --> 18:02.329
Yeah, you do.
We're gonna have a nice,

18:02.331 --> 18:03.597
gentlemanly conversation.

18:03.599 --> 18:05.732
Otherwise, the two of us are
gonna throw you in that car,

18:05.734 --> 18:07.601
take you down to the squad
and shine a white-hot light

18:07.603 --> 18:10.069
in your eyes,
you understand?

18:10.071 --> 18:11.671
What do you want?

18:11.673 --> 18:14.440
I want to know
who killed Derrick.

18:14.442 --> 18:15.508
What you talking about,
who killed Derrick?

18:15.510 --> 18:17.376
He killed himself.

18:17.378 --> 18:19.245
Nope. He had choke marks
around his throat.

18:19.247 --> 18:20.947
What?

18:20.949 --> 18:22.481
Any chance they were from you?

18:22.483 --> 18:24.183
Hell no.
Derrick was my best friend.

18:24.185 --> 18:25.584
Yeah, we heard
about that.

18:25.586 --> 18:26.753
You loved him so much,

18:26.755 --> 18:28.387
you pulled him in as
your lookout, right?

18:28.389 --> 18:29.656
Some friend.
Look,

18:29.658 --> 18:32.691
Derrick was a grown man.
He did what he did on his own.

18:32.693 --> 18:34.593
You knew the cops
were coming to talk to him.

18:34.595 --> 18:36.828
And you knew Derrick didn't
have the stomach for that.

18:36.830 --> 18:38.096
He was gonna give all of you up.

18:38.098 --> 18:39.931
So you shut him up.
Isn't that right?

18:39.933 --> 18:41.367
No, I didn't do that.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.202
Then who did?
I don't know.

18:43.204 --> 18:44.136
I don't believe you.

18:44.138 --> 18:45.337
I don't care.

18:45.339 --> 18:46.938
Look,

18:46.940 --> 18:50.042
I didn't do anything.
Now can I go?

18:50.878 --> 18:52.778
Yeah, you can go.

18:53.647 --> 18:55.346
Take a walk.

18:55.348 --> 18:56.915
Just gonna let him go?

18:56.917 --> 18:59.051
Did he take his phone out yet?

19:00.220 --> 19:01.887
How'd you know?

19:01.889 --> 19:02.921
Is he making a call?

19:02.923 --> 19:04.656
As we speak.

19:04.658 --> 19:05.657
What time is it?

19:05.659 --> 19:08.159
14:45.
Great.

19:08.161 --> 19:09.994
Now we can go get a subpoena.

19:19.138 --> 19:22.439
Okay, o-okay.
I've seen enough.

19:22.441 --> 19:24.608
That's only
the first 12 hours.

19:24.610 --> 19:26.577
We got plenty more
footage.

19:26.579 --> 19:27.544
We're ready to move.

19:27.546 --> 19:29.379
But you need me
to sign off first.

19:29.381 --> 19:31.215
It's your jurisdiction.
We need your blessing.

19:31.217 --> 19:32.983
You know my boss
is gonna have my ass

19:32.985 --> 19:35.185
when he hears you guys get
the credit for these arrests.

19:36.388 --> 19:38.787
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

19:59.276 --> 20:01.076
Ain't no way five-O
out here like this

20:01.078 --> 20:03.712
unless one of y'all
dropped a dime.

20:03.714 --> 20:05.547
Y'all don't think
I'm gonna find out who?

20:05.549 --> 20:08.784
You already know not a blade
of grass grows around here

20:08.786 --> 20:11.086
unless I say so.

20:15.425 --> 20:16.891
All right.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.433
Is that e-mail server
still down?

20:25.435 --> 20:26.568
Of course.

20:26.570 --> 20:28.402
Any sign of that subpoena
coming through?

20:28.404 --> 20:29.637
Oh, yeah, sure.
It came an hour ago.

20:29.639 --> 20:32.073
I'm just standing here
'cause it looks good.

20:32.075 --> 20:33.908
You want to call
the A.D.A. again?

20:33.910 --> 20:35.209
I called the A.D.A.
three times.

20:35.211 --> 20:36.944
They said it was
on the way any minute.

20:36.946 --> 20:38.179
Ah! No, no.

20:38.181 --> 20:39.313
Back off.

20:39.315 --> 20:40.281
Okay?

20:40.283 --> 20:42.083
But I got to fax this
over to my wife.

20:42.085 --> 20:44.951
Look, there are 900 apps
where you can scan things

20:44.953 --> 20:46.219
and send it
to your wife, okay?

20:46.221 --> 20:48.622
Get with the 21st century.

20:48.624 --> 20:49.923
Bye-bye, Bitterman.

20:49.925 --> 20:52.726
Well, you were probably a
lot of fun in middle school.

20:52.728 --> 20:54.828
I was actually very popular
in middle school.

20:54.830 --> 20:56.163
Thank you.

20:56.165 --> 20:57.298
Hi, Byrne.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.232
- I got to check the fax machine.
- No, you don't.

20:59.234 --> 21:00.334
I don't?

21:00.336 --> 21:01.668
No, you don't.

21:03.371 --> 21:04.971
See you.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.540
Yeah, real blast, Reagan.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.309
Why don't you just go
make yourself useful,

21:09.311 --> 21:11.577
like maybe pull up
Jonas' phone records,

21:11.579 --> 21:13.113
so when the subpoena
does come through,

21:13.115 --> 21:14.080
we'll have a head start.

21:14.082 --> 21:15.081
For your information,

21:15.083 --> 21:16.616
it's already up on my screen.

21:16.618 --> 21:18.184
As soon as it comes
through, just one click,

21:18.186 --> 21:19.552
and we'll know
who Jonas called.

21:19.554 --> 21:21.253
Great.

21:21.989 --> 21:22.955
Ah.

21:22.957 --> 21:24.324
See that? Perfect timing.

21:25.226 --> 21:26.726
Come on, come on.

21:26.728 --> 21:28.260
Come on.

21:28.262 --> 21:30.029
We got it.

21:30.031 --> 21:32.231
What do you got?

21:32.233 --> 21:35.534
14:45 he called Kevin Keith.

21:35.536 --> 21:37.036
Kevin Keith. Anything on him?

21:41.675 --> 21:43.909
Wanted on
an outstanding warrant.

21:43.911 --> 21:46.245
Beautiful.

21:46.247 --> 21:47.646
Let's go find him.

21:48.782 --> 21:50.193
I still say we call the AG.

21:50.194 --> 21:50.950
We?

21:50.974 --> 21:52.685
- Him.
- And wonder aloud

21:52.686 --> 21:55.053
how Albany feels
about the mayor

21:55.055 --> 21:56.755
interfering with
a police investigation.

21:56.757 --> 21:58.337
He got the kid's bail
knocked down.

21:58.339 --> 22:01.036
That's not exactly interfering
with a police investigation.

22:01.037 --> 22:02.738
You might as well build
a yellow brick road

22:02.739 --> 22:04.102
leading right back
to this office.

22:04.103 --> 22:05.969
Attorney general
is law enforcement.

22:06.126 --> 22:07.391
He's not a friend
of this department.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.927
And he's not a fan
of city hall, either.

22:08.929 --> 22:10.662
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

22:10.664 --> 22:11.830
Exactly.

22:11.832 --> 22:14.065
No. Final answer. No.
Well, what do you got then?

22:14.067 --> 22:16.701
We share it with a couple
of selected news outlets,

22:16.703 --> 22:18.770
sit back and let nature
take its course.

22:18.772 --> 22:19.904
I'm not leaking it!

22:19.906 --> 22:21.072
Not leak, share.

22:21.074 --> 22:22.206
Not garbage, sanitation.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.275
Exactly.
And there is no guarantee

22:24.277 --> 22:25.609
the guy who leaked it
won't get leaked.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.012
I can guarantee.
No, you can't!

22:28.014 --> 22:31.748
And either way, AG or the press,
we end up looking like weasels.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.484
And by “we,” I mean me.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.718
So, we sit on our hands?

22:34.720 --> 22:36.553
Not saying that,
but I don't want to make

22:36.555 --> 22:38.589
some kind of clever move
that backfires

22:38.591 --> 22:43.293
and ends up washing the
mayor's hands for him, either.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.696
Your nose okay?
What do you mean?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.664
You breathing all right?

22:47.666 --> 22:48.732
Yeah, so?

22:48.734 --> 22:51.568
Me, too.

22:51.570 --> 22:56.506
We're sitting here
calculating our ass coverage...

22:56.508 --> 22:58.408
and we forgot something.

23:03.048 --> 23:06.249
Say yes, say no,
say hell no.

23:07.285 --> 23:09.986
Hey, why such a glum face?
It's a good day.

23:09.988 --> 23:11.654
We got a lot of bad
guys off the street.

23:12.491 --> 23:15.257
Yeah, about that.

23:16.093 --> 23:18.561
We got to cut everybody loose.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.029
What?

23:20.031 --> 23:22.665
Yeah, we got to let all the drug
dealers back out on the street.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.000
Why?

23:24.002 --> 23:25.735
Reggie's pulling out.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.202
You can't be serious.

23:27.204 --> 23:29.005
I just got off the phone
with him.

23:29.007 --> 23:31.606
Says he's no longer
willing to cooperate.

23:31.608 --> 23:33.108
But without Reggie,
we have hardly anything.

23:33.110 --> 23:34.709
You don't think I told him that?

23:34.711 --> 23:35.710
What did he say?

23:35.712 --> 23:38.113
Click.

23:53.973 --> 23:55.739
Officer Gagliano?

23:56.002 --> 23:58.002
The one and only.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.372
As you were.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.977
You got a minute?

24:06.979 --> 24:08.712
Commissioner.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.147
Sir.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.950
Officers.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.089
Hurts just looking at you.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.925
You should feel
it from this end.

24:20.927 --> 24:21.991
I'll bet.

24:21.993 --> 24:25.128
Doc says it's gonna take
at least two surgeries

24:25.130 --> 24:26.296
to fix your beak.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.297
You spoke to my doctor?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.998
And the department surgeon.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.068
He's gonna oversee
the procedures.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.336
- You really don't have to...
- I want to.

24:33.338 --> 24:34.737
Thank you, sir.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.674
How's the other guy look?

24:37.676 --> 24:39.909
Never laid a hand on him.

24:39.911 --> 24:41.177
I heard.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.882
Commissioner, I don't know what
you heard, but I'm all good.

24:45.884 --> 24:49.953
Well, what I heard is
a rich kid started a bar fight

24:49.955 --> 24:53.056
and when you tried to break
it up, he landed a cheap shot

24:53.058 --> 24:54.756
and broke your nose
in three places.

24:54.758 --> 24:56.258
How am I doing so far?

24:56.260 --> 24:58.660
Pretty much.

24:58.662 --> 25:01.363
Then you got a kick in the teeth
at the arraignment

25:01.365 --> 25:03.966
when the judge released him
with no bail.

25:04.802 --> 25:06.735
I won't lie, I was
surprised by that.

25:06.737 --> 25:08.804
Surprised?

25:08.806 --> 25:10.406
Or pissed off?

25:10.408 --> 25:12.874
That's above my pay grade,
Commissioner.

25:12.876 --> 25:14.710
No, it's not.

25:14.712 --> 25:19.347
Pay grade's got nothing
to do with right and wrong.

25:19.349 --> 25:22.618
The guy who sucker punched you,
you know who he is?

25:22.620 --> 25:24.352
Who is father is?

25:24.354 --> 25:26.287
I found out.

25:26.289 --> 25:30.191
So, you know why
the judge let him go.

25:30.193 --> 25:32.460
Yes, sir.

25:32.462 --> 25:35.896
Yet you didn't raise a stink
with your C.O. or the union.

25:35.898 --> 25:37.765
No, sir.

25:37.767 --> 25:39.033
Why is that?

25:39.035 --> 25:41.402
I know how the world works.

25:41.404 --> 25:43.338
People like me been losing
to people like him

25:43.340 --> 25:45.906
since the world
first started spinning.

25:48.244 --> 25:50.444
Do you like it like that?

25:59.055 --> 26:01.255
Reggie.

26:02.224 --> 26:03.957
Morning, Miss Erin.

26:03.959 --> 26:05.659
Good morning? That's
all you have to say?

26:05.661 --> 26:09.162
Reggie, we need your help
down in the basement.

26:09.164 --> 26:11.831
Be right there.

26:11.833 --> 26:14.668
I need to go down
to the basement.

26:23.178 --> 26:24.810
Come on, Reggie.

26:24.812 --> 26:26.445
What's going on?
Why won't you talk to me?

26:26.447 --> 26:27.680
Got nothing to say.

26:27.682 --> 26:30.583
No? That's a far cry
from the position a few days ago

26:30.585 --> 26:32.051
when you showed up
in my office,

26:32.053 --> 26:33.486
begging me
to scratch your back.

26:33.488 --> 26:34.520
Yeah, well...

26:34.522 --> 26:35.988
“Yeah, well”
is not a response.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.590
It's the best I can do.

26:37.592 --> 26:39.224
Did someone threaten you?

26:39.226 --> 26:41.160
Because if that's the case,
I could help you.

26:41.162 --> 26:42.594
Nope.

26:42.596 --> 26:45.630
Now you just out of the blue
decided you no longer wanted

26:45.632 --> 26:47.833
to rid your building
of drug dealers?

26:47.835 --> 26:49.267
Yeah, something like that.

26:49.269 --> 26:51.336
It's quite a remarkable
turnaround, wouldn't you say?

26:51.338 --> 26:55.207
I'd say that I need
to get back to work.

26:55.209 --> 26:56.974
So, that's it?

26:56.976 --> 26:58.910
And that...
I'm sorry.

26:58.912 --> 27:00.645
All right? I'm sorry.

27:00.647 --> 27:01.680
Come on, Reggie.

27:01.682 --> 27:02.880
I know something's going on.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.982
Don't keep me in the dark.
Let me help you.

27:04.984 --> 27:07.252
Uh, Daddy?

27:08.589 --> 27:11.022
Can I play <i>Candy Crush?</i>

27:14.327 --> 27:17.328
I'll-I'll be with you
in a minute, Trevor.

27:18.464 --> 27:21.298
Oh, Reggie, I am so sorry.

27:21.300 --> 27:24.001
Please, let me help you.
I can protect you.

27:24.003 --> 27:25.636
I can protect Trevor.

27:25.638 --> 27:29.005
Have a good day, Miss Erin.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.020
Detective Baez, Kevin.
We need to...

27:44.022 --> 27:45.188
Hey!

27:45.190 --> 27:46.957
Stop! Police!

27:46.959 --> 27:49.025
Kevin, get back here!

27:50.028 --> 27:50.994
Hey!

28:07.111 --> 28:09.779
That's how you build
a better mousetrap.

28:09.781 --> 28:11.881
I got him!

28:21.558 --> 28:23.225
Excuse me, Detective.

28:23.227 --> 28:25.861
Brad Taft, uh, Mr. Keith's
court-appointed lawyer.

28:25.863 --> 28:26.962
He's got a lawyer?

28:26.964 --> 28:28.230
Got his case
20 minutes ago.

28:28.232 --> 28:30.266
Good. Well, I'm just gonna
go ask him some questions,

28:30.268 --> 28:31.533
so why don't you join me?

28:31.535 --> 28:32.734
No, you weren't.

28:32.736 --> 28:34.136
How's that?

28:34.138 --> 28:35.671
- My client has nothing to say.
- Your client?

28:35.673 --> 28:36.772
You never even met the kid.

28:36.774 --> 28:38.106
Nope, I haven't.

28:38.108 --> 28:40.342
Look, we got a
16-year-old boy

28:40.344 --> 28:43.011
who was murdered and made
to look like a suicide.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.245
You understand?

28:44.247 --> 28:46.315
Not my job to help
your case, Detective.

28:46.317 --> 28:48.583
Maybe a little respect
for the circumstances.

28:48.585 --> 28:50.285
Circumstances like
my client's father

28:50.287 --> 28:52.486
says he was with him
at the time of the murder?

28:52.488 --> 28:53.822
Now, that's a
rock solid alibi.

28:53.824 --> 28:56.858
Though, I bet you I
could poke a dozen holes

28:56.860 --> 28:58.559
in the old man's alibi
within five minutes.

28:58.561 --> 29:00.661
Just looking out for
my client's best interests.

29:00.663 --> 29:01.896
Your client,

29:01.898 --> 29:04.465
who you've never even met,
who's got a dozen arrests

29:04.467 --> 29:06.100
and is wanted on an
outstanding warrant?

29:06.102 --> 29:07.868
You got the right
to hold him on the warrant,

29:07.870 --> 29:09.704
but he's not answering
any questions on your homicide.

29:09.706 --> 29:12.272
Let me just talk to him
for a minute, okay?

29:12.274 --> 29:13.407
I'll ask a few questions,

29:13.409 --> 29:15.075
you don't like where
I'm going with it,

29:15.077 --> 29:16.109
you shut it down.

29:16.111 --> 29:17.778
I think I already did just that.

29:19.615 --> 29:22.082
Return him to court
on the warrant.

29:23.853 --> 29:25.385
Do you believe
that cheap suit?

29:25.387 --> 29:28.155
I swear, he must've gone to the
same law school as my sister:

29:28.157 --> 29:30.157
Ball Buster University.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.458
Maybe he has a point.

29:31.460 --> 29:34.161
Are you defending
a public defender?

29:34.163 --> 29:35.295
The M.E.'s report

29:35.297 --> 29:37.364
said the size and impression
of the bruising

29:37.366 --> 29:38.798
on Derrick's neck was deep.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.900
So?
So, I called her

29:39.902 --> 29:41.468
to see if she could give us

29:41.470 --> 29:43.603
a sense of how big
the assailant was.

29:43.605 --> 29:45.204
And?

29:45.206 --> 29:47.774
The M.E. thinks
the assailant was an adult.

29:47.776 --> 29:49.709
That kid is
a buck 50 soaking wet.

29:49.711 --> 29:52.712
Okay, well, the M.E. was wrong
before about the bruises.

29:52.714 --> 29:55.214
You remember that? Maybe
she's wrong again this time.

29:55.216 --> 29:57.416
Maybe, maybe not.

30:02.023 --> 30:04.523
Where are you going?

30:07.362 --> 30:08.995
I spoke to one of the cops

30:08.997 --> 30:10.129
who works
those projects.

30:10.131 --> 30:11.830
Said the gang
jumped little Trevor

30:11.832 --> 30:13.165
on his way to school.

30:13.167 --> 30:14.700
They broke his arm, Anthony.

30:14.702 --> 30:16.468
A six-year-old little boy.

30:16.470 --> 30:18.203
Want to send a message
to the father?

30:18.205 --> 30:19.805
You hit him
where it hurts the most.

30:19.807 --> 30:23.375
These guys are animals.
I want them in cages.

30:23.377 --> 30:27.212
On top of it, they silenced
one of the good guys.

30:27.214 --> 30:30.581
Which means
the bad guys are winning.

30:30.583 --> 30:32.350
How do we, in
good conscience,

30:32.352 --> 30:34.419
ask the next Reggie
that comes forward

30:34.421 --> 30:36.988
to stick his neck out,
to do what's right,

30:36.990 --> 30:38.990
when we know this
is what happens?

30:38.992 --> 30:40.992
Oh, God.

30:42.462 --> 30:44.262
You here to gloat?

30:44.264 --> 30:45.797
Actually, I'm here
to lend a hand.

30:45.799 --> 30:46.931
Oh, yeah? How?

30:46.933 --> 30:49.434
To answer your question,
it takes a village.

30:49.436 --> 30:50.868
Come again?

30:50.870 --> 30:52.904
My grandmother used to say,
“In the Bronx,

30:52.906 --> 30:54.839
“you don't ask one man
to do what's right.

30:54.841 --> 30:57.041
You ask the whole block.”

31:01.047 --> 31:04.481
All right.
Okay, thanks.

31:09.221 --> 31:10.254
What's wrong with you?

31:10.256 --> 31:12.289
You eat one too
many wantons?

31:12.291 --> 31:14.491
No. I do feel like
I'm gonna be sick, though.

31:14.493 --> 31:15.625
What is it?

31:15.627 --> 31:18.062
When the M.E. said
it was an adult,

31:18.064 --> 31:20.497
I don't know,
something happened.

31:20.499 --> 31:23.299
A bad feeling inside,
like a sinking feeling.

31:23.301 --> 31:24.734
Uh-huh.

31:24.736 --> 31:27.303
So I did some
sniffing around.

31:27.305 --> 31:30.106
And your bad feeling
led you to...?

31:31.477 --> 31:33.042
Derrick's mom.

31:33.044 --> 31:36.279
Investigated three times
by Child Services.

31:36.281 --> 31:39.248
For beating her son.

31:48.851 --> 31:50.050
Detectives.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.275
Mind if we come in?

31:54.112 --> 31:55.978
What?

31:55.980 --> 31:57.113
We have some news.

31:57.115 --> 31:58.981
Oh?
Turns out,

31:58.983 --> 32:00.883
your son didn't kill
himself after all.

32:00.885 --> 32:02.551
What do you mean?

32:02.553 --> 32:04.921
Mrs. Madigan,
your son was murdered.

32:05.790 --> 32:09.291
Oh, no! No...

32:09.293 --> 32:11.827
And the good news is
we know who did it.

32:11.829 --> 32:14.196
You do?
Mm-hmm.

32:14.198 --> 32:16.232
It was you.

32:16.234 --> 32:17.833
Me?

32:17.835 --> 32:19.435
Yeah.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.002
Shame on you.

32:21.004 --> 32:22.871
Shame on you,
coming into my house

32:22.873 --> 32:24.306
and saying
a thing like that.

32:24.308 --> 32:25.674
Get out!

32:25.676 --> 32:28.610
Get out of here...
We're not going anywhere!

32:28.612 --> 32:30.378
Did you know that all
of your Internet searches

32:30.380 --> 32:31.579
are saved in the cloud?

32:31.581 --> 32:34.149
A cloud? What-what the hell
are you talking about?

32:34.151 --> 32:36.618
We have a record of every one
of your Internet searches.

32:36.620 --> 32:37.786
Specifically,

32:37.788 --> 32:39.487
the ones about
how to make a murder

32:39.489 --> 32:40.588
look like a suicide.

32:40.590 --> 32:41.589
No, it wasn't me.

32:41.591 --> 32:42.724
You're the only person
who lives here.

32:42.726 --> 32:44.459
And you have a history
of beating your son.

32:44.461 --> 32:46.894
You found out he was
involved in the robberies.

32:46.896 --> 32:49.063
You got angry, you lost control.

32:49.065 --> 32:50.665
And you wrapped your hands
around his throat.

32:50.667 --> 32:52.467
And then, you did the unthinkable.
No, I...

32:52.469 --> 32:53.545
Yeah, you did.

32:53.569 --> 32:54.336
I didn't--
stop it.

32:54.337 --> 32:56.671
I didn't mean it.
It wasn't my fault.

32:56.673 --> 32:58.539
It <i>wasn't</i> my fault.
I told him a thousand times

32:58.541 --> 32:59.974
and he wouldn't
listen to me.

32:59.976 --> 33:03.110
It was those boys!
Those boys were no good!

33:03.112 --> 33:04.544
It's their fault.

33:04.546 --> 33:06.247
If he never
hung out with them,

33:06.249 --> 33:07.748
none of this
would have happened.

33:07.750 --> 33:10.490
Turn around and put hands
behind your back.

33:10.514 --> 33:10.585
Please.

33:10.586 --> 33:12.153
Turn around, put your
hands behind your back.

33:12.155 --> 33:13.353
There must be something.

33:13.355 --> 33:14.755
I'm telling you,
it was an accident.

33:14.757 --> 33:16.189
I didn't mean
to kill my son.

33:16.191 --> 33:17.524
You're under arrest.

33:17.526 --> 33:18.925
Please. Please.

33:18.927 --> 33:21.295
I didn't mean...

33:37.745 --> 33:39.745
Look, Miss Erin,
I told you, I'm done.

33:39.747 --> 33:41.480
I'm out.
I know and I respect that.

33:41.482 --> 33:43.049
I just want you
to see something.

33:43.051 --> 33:45.285
What?
Trust me.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.528
Take a look at this.

34:03.371 --> 34:05.470
Very cool.
Can I go now?

34:05.472 --> 34:07.906
Hold on. Anthony, show him.

34:13.714 --> 34:15.612
What's
happening? What...?

34:15.614 --> 34:16.949
What is all this?

34:16.951 --> 34:19.083
- It's all your neighbors, Reggie.
- When we told them

34:19.085 --> 34:20.085
what happened to you,

34:20.087 --> 34:21.652
they all wanted to help.

34:21.655 --> 34:22.821
Every last one of 'em

34:22.822 --> 34:26.157
let us install a camera
in their apartment.

34:30.397 --> 34:32.397
I, uh...

34:32.399 --> 34:35.233
I-I don't know what to say.

34:35.235 --> 34:37.301
Say “go.”

34:37.303 --> 34:39.003
What?

34:39.005 --> 34:42.005
Give the order: “Go.”

34:44.077 --> 34:45.676
Go.

34:46.913 --> 34:49.513
Go, go, go!
Go, move!

35:03.095 --> 35:04.461
Get down!

35:04.463 --> 35:07.431
Hands! Show me
your hands! Now!

35:07.433 --> 35:08.799
You're under arrest.

35:12.537 --> 35:14.670
Behind your back!

35:16.975 --> 35:17.974
On your feet!

35:17.976 --> 35:20.676
All right...

35:28.453 --> 35:29.685
Get him out of here!

35:29.687 --> 35:32.422
Move it!

35:36.060 --> 35:39.562
Move it. Move it! Eyes front!

35:39.564 --> 35:42.164
Coming through.

35:42.166 --> 35:44.233
Coming through.
Let's go, let's go.

35:44.235 --> 35:45.734
Make a path!

35:45.736 --> 35:46.735
Look straight ahead.

35:46.737 --> 35:48.570
You gonna pay
for this, son.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.006
You damn well
better bank on that.

35:51.008 --> 35:52.374
He didn't have
nothing to do with it.

35:52.376 --> 35:53.409
My ass he didn't.

35:53.411 --> 35:54.709
True story.

35:54.711 --> 35:56.711
Well, if not him, then who?

35:59.016 --> 36:01.082
It was me.

36:02.385 --> 36:04.719
It was me.

36:06.323 --> 36:08.623
It was me.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.692
- It was me.
- It was me.

36:10.694 --> 36:12.761
- It was me.
- Me, too.

36:12.763 --> 36:15.096
Yeah, it was me.

36:35.518 --> 36:37.451
Yeah, little man.

36:37.453 --> 36:39.653
A soldier just
like your father.

36:44.293 --> 36:46.627
You might have run that by me.

36:46.629 --> 36:47.695
Might have.
Didn't, though.

36:47.697 --> 36:48.762
I got that.
Garrett,

36:48.764 --> 36:50.597
I did not need De-fanging.

36:50.599 --> 36:53.433
The attorney general and I had
a very productive conversation.

36:53.435 --> 36:55.602
Is he having a productive
conversation with our mayor?

36:55.604 --> 36:56.769
- That's up to him.
- I thought you

36:56.771 --> 36:57.937
didn't want to come off
as a weasel.

36:57.939 --> 36:59.473
Hey, Garrett...
His word.

36:59.475 --> 37:01.641
I'll take “weasel”
over “chicken” any day.

37:01.643 --> 37:03.010
Try ostrich.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.211
Why ostrich?

37:04.213 --> 37:06.213
Burying his head in the sand.

37:07.244 --> 37:08.363
I'm not.

37:08.367 --> 37:09.035
You know, you can't

37:09.036 --> 37:11.203
make the politics go away just
'cause you don't like 'em.

37:11.205 --> 37:13.973
The call I made
was all about politics.

37:13.975 --> 37:14.840
I'm lost.

37:14.842 --> 37:16.242
Politically speaking,

37:16.244 --> 37:20.612
Officer Gagliano and all of our
35,000 cops are my constituents.

37:20.614 --> 37:22.248
I turn a blind eye
to their needs,

37:22.250 --> 37:23.682
I'm throwing 'em
under the bus.

37:23.684 --> 37:25.784
But they can't fire
you. The mayor can.

37:25.786 --> 37:28.487
But if he doesn't have
their loyalty and their support?

37:28.489 --> 37:33.224
I'd be an empty suit.
I'd have already lost the job.

37:43.036 --> 37:45.069
Erin, can you pass the potatoes?

37:45.071 --> 37:47.672
Here, let me.

37:49.810 --> 37:52.043
Got any more meat down there?

37:52.045 --> 37:53.211
No, I got it.

37:53.213 --> 37:54.412
Thanks, Frank.

37:54.414 --> 37:55.780
You're welcome. Incoming.

37:56.783 --> 37:58.916
The rare ones you like
are on the bottom.

37:58.918 --> 38:00.451
Thank you.

38:02.288 --> 38:03.954
You feeling okay?

38:03.956 --> 38:05.556
Seriously.

38:05.558 --> 38:07.925
Never better. Why?

38:07.927 --> 38:09.527
Because you're happy.

38:09.529 --> 38:11.762
You're just so amiable.

38:11.764 --> 38:13.297
Can't a guy be in a good mood?

38:13.299 --> 38:15.398
Not like this,
not without cause.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.267
Oh, now I got to show cause?

38:17.269 --> 38:18.668
And you were singing
pretty loud in church.

38:18.670 --> 38:20.603
- Sure were.
- And the way you raced up

38:20.605 --> 38:22.940
to communion, it was like
they were handing out $20 bills.

38:22.942 --> 38:24.308
That did not happen.

38:24.310 --> 38:25.809
Pop?

38:25.811 --> 38:26.811
Francis?

38:31.850 --> 38:36.720
Okay. I guess
it's gonna come out anyway.

38:36.722 --> 38:40.156
Your father has declared war
on our mayor.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.626
What?

38:43.628 --> 38:45.762
I wouldn't call him
“our mayor” right now.

38:45.764 --> 38:47.129
He disrespected us.

38:47.131 --> 38:48.430
You mean the family?

38:48.432 --> 38:50.299
No, our NYPD family.

38:50.301 --> 38:51.901
What do you
mean by “war”?

38:51.903 --> 38:55.437
I mean, he fired a cannon
across the bow.

38:55.439 --> 38:56.638
Oh, it's nothing like that.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.407
Calling the attorney general

38:58.409 --> 38:59.608
and then, accusing the mayor

38:59.610 --> 39:01.810
of interfering
in police business?

39:01.812 --> 39:02.678
Something like that.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.012
You did not.

39:04.014 --> 39:05.781
He most sure as hell did.

39:05.783 --> 39:06.982
Wow.

39:06.984 --> 39:08.183
Wow, exactly.

39:08.185 --> 39:10.819
As in,
“Wow, what a bonehead move.”

39:10.821 --> 39:15.491
I was not going to look
the other way this time.

39:15.493 --> 39:18.861
You guys have had your issues,
but calling the A.G.?

39:18.863 --> 39:20.762
Did the mayor interfere
with police business?

39:20.764 --> 39:21.963
Yes.

39:21.965 --> 39:23.498
How?

39:23.500 --> 39:24.799
Just trust me on this one.

39:24.801 --> 39:26.501
I trust you,

39:26.503 --> 39:28.069
and I support you.

39:28.071 --> 39:29.637
Yeah, me, too,

39:29.639 --> 39:32.507
but you take a shot at the king,
you better not miss.

39:32.509 --> 39:35.543
My aim is true.

39:35.545 --> 39:39.146
He's got the heavy artillery.

39:41.083 --> 39:44.151
You can't fire him,
but he can fire you.

39:45.746 --> 39:48.668
Send that meat
back down here, please.
