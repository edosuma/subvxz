00:39.974 --> 00:41.774
(child shouts)

00:45.046 --> 00:47.880
Gordon Stutz.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.382
My former partner and mentor.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.885
How did you find me?

00:52.887 --> 00:53.986
It's not hard

00:53.988 --> 00:55.220
when you're looking for someone

00:55.222 --> 00:56.922
who wants to be found.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.558
What can I do you for, Gordo?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.560
How long we gonna
keep up this charade?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.729
That this is all enough.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.230
That this is all you need.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.735
What do you know
about what I need?!

01:09.737 --> 01:11.670
I know you need the smell
of that courtroom.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.772
You worship the law!

01:13.774 --> 01:15.007
That's another life, Stutz.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.577
You think this is easy for me?!

01:18.579 --> 01:20.279
You were the son
I never had!

01:20.281 --> 01:21.413
I taught you
everything!

01:21.415 --> 01:22.714
I gave you everything!

01:22.716 --> 01:24.416
My daughter!
My firm!

01:24.418 --> 01:25.717
And you took it away!

01:25.719 --> 01:26.919
That was my merger!

01:26.921 --> 01:29.488
Those were my stock options!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.424
I built that firm.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.096
(gun cocks)

01:37.098 --> 01:41.467
I suggest you reel in those
fishing lines, Counselor.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.870
'Cause things are
about to get tangled.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.607
What?!
(laughs):
Yeah!

01:48.609 --> 01:50.075
To be continued?

01:50.077 --> 01:51.777
It gets more powerful
every time I see it.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.778
Shall we?

01:52.780 --> 01:54.279
Part two--
Todd!

01:54.281 --> 01:56.115
We haven't even
discussed part one yet.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.783
Oh, I thought we were
gonna watch both parts,

01:57.785 --> 02:00.152
and then discuss it
as a collective piece.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.454
No! We watch one,
then we talk about it.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.456
Then we watch one,
then we talk about it.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.958
Come on, Todd.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.292
Sorry. As I was saying it,

02:07.294 --> 02:09.328
I realized that was
not a smart idea.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.896
It's a heck of a beard, son.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.431
The show had to take eight
months off while I grew it in.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.566
Worth it.
You guys are still here?!

02:14.568 --> 02:16.301
Todd, I see you
needed to pop off

02:16.303 --> 02:19.838
your shoes and your socks
to get comfortable; that's nice.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.607
How many of these are you guys
gonna watch, you think?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.609
As many as it takes.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.344
To do... what?

02:25.346 --> 02:26.745
Well, I guess
we could watch part two,

02:26.747 --> 02:28.080
and then take a little break?

02:28.082 --> 02:29.781
Sure, or you could
take the break now

02:29.783 --> 02:32.351
and then you can watch part two
later and somewhere else.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.353
Nah.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.921
Seriously, Todd?
What?!

02:35.923 --> 02:38.290
All the popcorn
that had missed your mouth

02:38.292 --> 02:40.826
and collected on your chest
is now on the floor.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.828
Stew! Stop yelling at Todd.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.530
He's my guest.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.865
I will take care of it.

02:46.867 --> 02:47.933
Todd?

02:47.935 --> 02:50.169
Yes, I'll clean this up.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.470
All right, now you're just,

02:51.472 --> 02:53.438
now you're just mashing it
deeper in the carpet.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.507
And it's in that room now!

02:55.509 --> 02:57.576
¶ ¶

03:00.047 --> 03:02.681
Stew, can you toss me
your car keys?

03:02.683 --> 03:05.017
Sure... uh, why?
The truck can't fit
in the driveway.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.351
Truck?
Yeah, and you're blocking it.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.020
And Andre is not good
with reverse.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.055
Andre?
Particularly
with a truck of this size.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.557
Okay, Dean, who's Andre?

03:11.559 --> 03:13.058
And what truck?
And what's happening?

03:13.060 --> 03:14.893
Well, I told you I sold
my house in L.A., right?

03:14.895 --> 03:17.062
No, I have not heard that ever.
No, you did not tell us that.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.197
I feel like we would
remember that.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.631
This is news to us, mm-hmm.
Big news.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.966
Really? Huh.
Thought I did.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.201
Anyway, Andre brought
my stuff out.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.369
And I should
get him a sandwich.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.705
Uh, Dean, I'm sorry.
Who's Andre?

03:26.707 --> 03:29.374
He's my stand-in.
I don't, I don't know
what a stand-in is.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.376
And my body double.
That's even less clear.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.645
Oh, so any shot

03:33.647 --> 03:35.514
of The Grinder
where you don't see my face,

03:35.516 --> 03:37.015
it's Andre.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.483
We're identical

03:38.485 --> 03:39.651
from behind.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.220
So he does
all my wide shots,

03:41.222 --> 03:42.554
my faceless lovemaking shots

03:42.556 --> 03:44.156
and stands there,
while they do

03:44.158 --> 03:45.857
all the boring lighting stuff.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.025
(truck horn honking)

03:47.027 --> 03:48.260
That is a semi truck.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.062
Are you bringing
all that stuff in here?

03:50.064 --> 03:51.763
'Cause, you know, Dean,
I'm-I'm just,

03:51.765 --> 03:54.333
I'm just looking around,
and I'm thinking, spatially,

03:54.335 --> 03:57.002
we don't have, uh, room.
Hm-mm.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.370
That's why I sent the first
four trucks to storage!

03:58.372 --> 04:00.038
Thanks.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.741
(stammers)

04:04.612 --> 04:06.612
Okay, this is real now.
Oh, this just got real<i> now?</i>

04:06.614 --> 04:08.880
This has not been a real issue
for you until-until right now?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.716
Yeah, well, the semi truck
made it real for me.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.619
Yeah, I know-- that's why you
have to talk to him.
I do?

04:13.621 --> 04:14.753
Yeah.
He's your brother.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.754
Well, that's the perfect reason

04:15.756 --> 04:16.888
why you should do it,

04:16.890 --> 04:18.023
because you're not weighted down

04:18.025 --> 04:19.391
by all the, you know,
the baggage.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.859
Oh, that makes complete sense.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.728
Except I'm not doing that.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.196
Not happening.

04:24.198 --> 04:25.364
Oh, hon, come on.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.732
You know how
sensitive he is.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.634
He's gonna take it
the wrong way,

04:28.636 --> 04:30.269
he's gonna think I don't want
to be his brother anymore,

04:30.271 --> 04:32.571
and he's gonna make me meet him
at a lake or something,

04:32.573 --> 04:34.806
to talk about it at midnight.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.375
Just tell him that we've loved
having him...
Which we have.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.576
that we're excited
to help him start this

04:37.578 --> 04:38.644
new chapter in his life...

04:38.646 --> 04:39.978
Which we are.
But, you know,

04:39.980 --> 04:42.314
maybe just hold off
on unloading

04:42.316 --> 04:44.583
an entire semi truck
into our home.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.018
STEWART:
<i> Dean?</i>

04:46.787 --> 04:48.654
Uh, excuse me, Dean?

04:48.656 --> 04:49.655
Oh, my God!

04:49.657 --> 04:50.722
Sorry, Andre.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.990
You're Andre.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.126
And you must be Stewart.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.894
Yes, yes, that's right. Hi.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.297
Ah. (grunting)

04:58.299 --> 04:59.298
Okay. (chuckles)

04:59.300 --> 05:01.733
I have heard so much about you.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.403
Oh, likewise, likewise.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.504
Oh, good.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.672
Uh, sorry I screamed

05:06.674 --> 05:07.906
when I saw your face.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.174
DEAN:
Look at this!

05:09.176 --> 05:11.843
Ah, I like
what I'm seeing here.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.078
And I like what I'm feeling.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.414
Good energy
between you two already.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.581
Excited to see where it goes.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.750
Me, too.
Yeah, definitely.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.419
Listen, cherish every moment
you get with this man.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.953
Doing it.
Soak it all up.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.188
'Cause this is
a new chapter for you.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.923
It's a whole cha-- new chapter?
Is he...?

05:24.925 --> 05:26.258
You're gonna be sticking around
for a little while then?

05:26.260 --> 05:28.527
Um, Andre, can you
give us a sec?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.529
I can and I will.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.700
He's so deep.
Yeah, seems, seems great.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.934
I have a confession to make.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.936
When I sold my house
in Malibu...

05:37.938 --> 05:40.305
Yeah?
...I forgot Andre
was living in it.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.641
Okay.
When I quit<i> The Grinder,</i>
you know,

05:42.643 --> 05:44.376
that put him out of a job.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.544
Where's this going?

05:45.546 --> 05:46.978
Andre is in the midst

05:46.980 --> 05:49.481
of a very steep downward spiral.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.116
That's why I had him
drive the truck out here.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.384
To take his mind off of it.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.985
Dean, I'm very sorry
to hear that,

05:53.987 --> 05:56.221
but he can't stay here,
if that's what you were asking.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.389
No, no way.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.457
Is it because he's gay?

05:58.459 --> 05:59.624
Wha...? No!

05:59.626 --> 06:01.493
I didn't even know that, Dean!

06:01.495 --> 06:02.794
Why would that
make a difference?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.830
You tell me.
(Debbie screams)

06:04.832 --> 06:07.232
Oh, sounds like Deb
just met Andre.

06:10.704 --> 06:14.072
So, what your talk accomplished
was Dean is still not

06:14.074 --> 06:16.375
moving out and Andre
is now moving in?

06:16.377 --> 06:18.543
(sighs)
Currently, yes, Deb.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.880
That is the...
that is the situation.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.483
Got it.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.551
Good job.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.891
Uh, Dean...?

06:34.695 --> 06:35.894
What's up?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.263
Okay, um, well,

06:38.265 --> 06:40.665
(clears throat)
Dean, since you have sold

06:40.667 --> 06:42.100
your place in Malibu...

06:42.102 --> 06:43.668
Congratulations,
by the way.
Thank you.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.404
Um, I-I just started wondering
if there's, uh,

06:45.406 --> 06:46.938
you know, another property

06:46.940 --> 06:48.774
you were thinking about,
uh, investing in?

06:48.776 --> 06:51.343
Just for capital gains reasons.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.111
For capital gains?
Yeah, capital gains, mostly.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.381
Because it seems silly to let
that money get taxed like that.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.284
'Cause there's a lot of other
opportunities here in Boise

06:59.286 --> 07:01.119
for reinvestment.
You could go--
Stew, Stew.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.221
I know what this is all about.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.856
I've overstayed my welcome.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.591
No, Dean, Deb and have
loved having you here.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.692
"Loved"? Wow.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.428
I can see I'm already gone.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.862
DEAN SR.:
Deano!

07:10.864 --> 07:12.964
Bang-up job on these
cross complaint filings.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.566
Uh, that's actually mine, Dad.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.535
Are you sure? Because they
read just like Dean.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.737
Yeah, pretty sure.
All right, if you say so.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.939
Dad, before you go,
you're gonna want to hear this.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.575
Stewart's asked me to move out.
What?!

07:23.577 --> 07:25.076
No, that's not--
I've not asked him.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.711
Claire, you may want
to come in here for this.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.380
Todd...
Did the filings bounce back?

07:28.382 --> 07:29.815
No, I just got
kicked to the streets.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.383
I'm not kicking you
out on the street.

07:31.385 --> 07:32.751
I just wanted
to start a conversation.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.886
Well, you always have
a bed at my place.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.922
And you're always welcome
to the air mattress I sleep on.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.890
Just say the word and
I will make that happen.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.560
Claire, what's your offer?
Oh. Uh, no offer.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.761
Well, that's fair.
Dad, Todd...

07:42.763 --> 07:44.396
I will let you know my decision.

07:44.398 --> 07:47.299
It is... unclear where
I will be sleeping tonight.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.335
But what is clear

07:50.337 --> 07:52.471
is where I will<i> not </i>
be sleeping tonight.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.741
Or ever again.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.785
¶ ¶

08:06.787 --> 08:09.855
Uncle Dean loved
taco nights, Dad.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.122
LIZZIE: Yeah. It was
his favorite night.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.824
Right after Sloppy Joe night.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.192
Why am I the bad guy here?

08:14.194 --> 08:15.660
Because you kicked out
your own brother.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.928
I did not do that. I...

08:16.930 --> 08:18.163
your mom will
back me up on this.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.164
Your father has never
been that direct

08:19.166 --> 08:20.465
about anything in his life.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.634
Thank you. And if I know
anything about your uncle,

08:22.636 --> 08:24.870
it's that he'll be back,
believe me.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.505
Okay. Well, until that happens,

08:26.507 --> 08:28.039
I don't think I can
participate in taco night.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.541
Me neither.
ANDRE:
Me neither.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.044
Thank you, Andre.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.446
<i> (children clamoring on TV)</i>

08:34.448 --> 08:36.147
Grinder!
Grinder!
(laughs)

08:36.149 --> 08:38.116
(speaking Spanish)

08:38.118 --> 08:39.417
(child speaking Spanish)

08:48.695 --> 08:50.362
(laughing)

08:50.364 --> 08:52.898
It's taco night over there.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.034
I'm missing it.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.335
Well, I got
some taco shells.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.803
We could just dump
the chili into 'em.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.872
Oh, nah, Dad. It's okay.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.474
It's not the same.

09:02.476 --> 09:03.842
Nah, it isn't.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.244
Maybe he's just had enough.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.512
You know?

09:07.514 --> 09:09.714
I'm a big personality.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.917
I can suck a lot of air
out of the room.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.586
I think you suck the perfect
amount of air, son.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.958
Sorry.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.464
Sorry.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.770
¶ ¶

09:31.772 --> 09:33.772
Good morning, Andre.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.273
Morning.
You kids are up early.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.875
Mom, you look
kind of rough.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.009
Thanks, Ethan.
Appreciate it.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.844
Ethan...
I'm sorry, Andre.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.047
Hey, where are all Dean's boxes?
I put them in storage.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.449
Wait. You moved an entire
semitruck-worth of boxes

09:44.451 --> 09:45.717
into storage last night?

09:45.719 --> 09:46.785
And he fixed
the dishwasher.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.687
Wow! Thanks, Andre.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.622
We've been trying to find time
to do that for weeks.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.856
ANDRE:
Well, you're in
the clear.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.558
Pancakes?
Yeah. Sure.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.693
Why the hell not?

09:54.695 --> 09:56.394
Deb?
Oh, no,
thank you.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.796
I'm feeling a little
under the weather.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.031
You are?
Yeah.
Oh...

10:00.033 --> 10:01.399
ANDRE: Stew, would you mind
putting your hand

10:01.401 --> 10:02.801
on your wife's forehead
for me, please?

10:02.803 --> 10:04.436
I... I wouldn't.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.973
Oh, babe, you are kind of warm.
Oh, yeah?

10:07.975 --> 10:09.975
Yeah, she's definitely
fighting something off.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.110
Oh, it's fine, you guys.
I can't take a sick day.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.878
Well, hon, that is
what they're there for.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.146
You gotta listen
to your body, Mom.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.214
You never listen.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.482
Okay.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.984
Well, if you guys
all insist...

10:18.986 --> 10:19.884
I insist.

10:19.886 --> 10:20.652
Mm-hmm.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.821
Thank you, Andre.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.122
¶ ¶

10:24.124 --> 10:26.124
It is a total 180
at Dad's.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.392
He's got a pool,

10:27.394 --> 10:28.793
there's no line
for the bathroom

10:28.795 --> 10:30.295
and no one's being
a raging butthole.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.330
Did you call me
a "raging butthole"?

10:32.332 --> 10:33.331
Watch it, Stew.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.799
Stewart, I've lived in a lot

10:34.801 --> 10:36.568
of different places
other than your house.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.570
I'm just saying, at Dad's,
nobody's a raging butthole.

10:38.572 --> 10:40.338
That's all, Stew.
Oh.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.906
Juror number 11.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.174
Have you ever had
a negative experience

10:43.176 --> 10:44.809
with a member
of a hospital staff?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.745
I was on a bunch of pills once
and I strangled a nurse.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.013
Does that count?

10:48.015 --> 10:49.247
Yeah, it counts.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.815
Um...

10:50.817 --> 10:53.318
uh, I think we need
to strike number 11.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.686
Damn, I kind of liked
number 11.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.588
She just said
she strangled a nurse.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.189
Yeah. On pills, Claire.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.624
We should also find out...

10:59.626 --> 11:01.026
Who is the plant

11:01.028 --> 11:03.294
on this jury?
The... plant?

11:03.296 --> 11:04.462
You think someone's
tampering with the jury

11:04.464 --> 11:05.697
on a basic property dispute?

11:05.699 --> 11:06.865
DEAN (quietly):
Claire, I want you

11:06.867 --> 11:07.932
to run a full security check

11:07.934 --> 11:09.668
on every one of these people.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.836
I want to know things about them

11:11.838 --> 11:13.872
that they don't even know
about themselves.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.640
What are you thinking?
A subpoena

11:15.642 --> 11:17.609
on all their cell records
and 24-hour video surveillance?

11:17.611 --> 11:18.643
That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

11:18.645 --> 11:19.644
TODD:
You heard the man, Claire.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.146
Go.
No. Wait, wait.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.480
Don't worry.
Not going anywhere.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.815
Right, because if she finds

11:23.817 --> 11:25.650
what I think she's gonna find,

11:25.652 --> 11:27.552
I can't protect all of us.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.154
Dean, there is no plant.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.288
Nobody's running
background checks

11:30.290 --> 11:32.057
on anyone, so just drop it.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.391
Oh.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.195
I understand
what's going on here.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.296
First you kick me
out of the house

11:38.298 --> 11:39.864
and now you...

11:39.866 --> 11:41.533
kick me out of the courtroom.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.901
That's not at all
what I'm saying.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.235
Well, that's what I'm hearing,

11:44.237 --> 11:47.205
coming from right here.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.406
Your mouth hole.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.549
(door opens)

11:57.551 --> 11:59.617
¶ ¶

12:05.892 --> 12:06.958
(zippers unzip)

12:08.562 --> 12:09.728
I hate this part, too.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.596
Urinating?

12:11.598 --> 12:12.831
Jury selection.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.334
(urinal flushing)

12:16.336 --> 12:17.602
(zips up, clears throat)

12:17.604 --> 12:19.504
Hugh Rozz. Pat Landy.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.173
Opposing counsel.
We're past that, right?
Not at all.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.942
Great. We'll keep
identifying ourselves, then.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.377
I'm sorry. Did I see what
I think I saw out there?

12:26.379 --> 12:27.579
Because what
I think I saw

12:27.581 --> 12:29.614
was a gifted legal mind

12:29.616 --> 12:31.049
getting shut out
of the process.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.517
I'm starting to get
wound up, Hugh.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.918
Oh, I'm already
wound up, Pat.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.620
Look, if you ever
want to swing by

12:35.622 --> 12:38.690
our office, talk...

12:38.692 --> 12:40.592
we love to listen.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.536
Come in. Come-come in.
Thank you. Um, have a seat.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.804
What is this about?
We have a lot of work to do.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.105
What are we talking about?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.607
We're talking about me.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.575
We're talking about
my role in the firm.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.576
I will sit for this.
DEAN:
It's like...

12:58.578 --> 12:59.811
Todd, I get it.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.079
You're the quirky associate.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.747
You like wrestling,

13:02.749 --> 13:04.783
you have a creepy
obsession with me...
Yes...

13:04.785 --> 13:06.551
Claire, you're the strong,
attractive female colleague.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.786
Will we kiss?
Will we not kiss?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.487
That's-that's very clear to me.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.455
We will not
come close to kissing.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.422
What am I?

13:11.424 --> 13:12.657
Well, you're the patriarch.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.092
Not as sharp as you used to be,

13:14.094 --> 13:15.560
but it's funny, so it works.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.427
Well, if it works...

13:16.429 --> 13:18.062
And Stew...
you're the lead.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.397
What are we talking about?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.598
It seems like you all have

13:20.600 --> 13:22.400
a pretty full cast as it is.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.903
Maybe you need a funny black guy
and a chubby guy with a beard.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.938
Well, Todd can do that.
Yeah, that's true.
You could...

13:26.940 --> 13:28.506
Yeah, I can try
and grow something in.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.240
It would help me.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.241
Oh, I think

13:30.243 --> 13:32.177
it would help everyone.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.913
DEBBIE:<i> You caulked all</i>
<i> the downstairs windows?</i>

13:34.915 --> 13:35.914
ANDRE:
<i> Yeah.</i>

13:35.916 --> 13:37.348
So what are
we thinking?

13:37.350 --> 13:40.018
Am I going into work this
afternoon, Andre, or...?

13:40.020 --> 13:41.853
The only work you have to do
is getting yourself better.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.521
Oh.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.657
So what you're saying is that

13:45.659 --> 13:48.359
I'm at work now, here,

13:48.361 --> 13:49.828
in front of the television?

13:49.830 --> 13:51.095
That's exactly what I'm saying.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.263
Oh, I like that.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.865
Would you mind if I step out

13:53.867 --> 13:55.366
to see an apartment
this afternoon?

13:55.368 --> 13:58.203
What... You're gonna go
see an apartment? Why?

13:58.205 --> 14:00.705
Well, I... I just feel like
I'm getting in the way here.

14:00.707 --> 14:03.007
What?! Andre!

14:03.009 --> 14:05.210
Don't be silly,
you're not getting in the way.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.178
All right, I'm gonna check
on the windows upstairs.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.546
There's a goat cheese
arugula salad in the fridge.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.781
I made it fresh.

14:09.783 --> 14:12.383
Where have you been all my life?

14:12.385 --> 14:13.685
Dean's guest house.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.288
¶ ¶

14:17.290 --> 14:19.457
All right, let me
get this straight:

14:19.459 --> 14:20.859
Your brother won't
let you speak in court

14:20.861 --> 14:22.794
just because you don't
have a degree?

14:22.796 --> 14:25.563
Yeah, he says the laws
in that area are "ironclad."

14:25.565 --> 14:27.398
So he's just gonna
let that law stand?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.533
Find a loophole, buddy.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.701
You can do that?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.135
Yeah, we do it
all the time.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.971
Dig up an old law,
say that it applies,

14:32.973 --> 14:35.540
and, boom, you're giving opening
statements later that day.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.876
Let me guess, I'll bet he's
got you studying for the bar.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.245
Yes, and it is so boring.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.247
But it is important.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.082
Yeah, if you want to learn
how to take a test,

14:44.084 --> 14:46.084
but it doesn't teach you
crap about the grind.
Thank you.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.853
You practiced law for,
what, eight seasons on TV?

14:48.855 --> 14:50.755
Yeah, and-and I think that
that should be worth something.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.590
Hell, yeah, it is.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.592
Would you rather have a heart
attack next to McDreamy

14:54.594 --> 14:56.594
or next to some guy who never
played a doctor on TV?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.062
McDreamy, no-brainer.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.431
I use that reference
weekly with Stewart.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.267
Only I use Noah Wyle.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.969
But McDreamy makes the point
in a much more dramatic way.

15:09.843 --> 15:13.244
You look good in here, and I'm
gonna go out on a limb and say

15:13.246 --> 15:16.114
you feel good in here too.
This could be your home, Hoss.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.715
Don't call me that.
Won't happen again.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.050
And, look, we don't doubt

15:19.052 --> 15:20.218
your brother wants you
at Sandy Yao.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.121
But does he want you enough?

15:26.559 --> 15:29.027
Season 4, Episode 17.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.965
"Grindsight is 20/20."

15:33.967 --> 15:36.968
You ran, but Gordon
Stutz came after you,

15:36.970 --> 15:38.803
because he needed you

15:38.805 --> 15:41.606
and couldn't run
the firm without you.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.042
You think Stewart
would chase after you...

15:44.044 --> 15:46.744
if you were to run?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.546
(phone rings)
DEBBIE (sick voice):<i> Mm-ello?</i>

15:48.548 --> 15:49.547
MAN:
Uh, Deb Sanderson?

15:49.549 --> 15:50.982
Who's asking?

15:50.984 --> 15:52.383
Yes, I'm Sam Biddle,

15:52.385 --> 15:54.652
landlord over at 287 Garvey.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.054
A man named Andre listed you
as a reference.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.056
Oh... right.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.059
I cannot say enough nice
things about him.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.628
Great. He'll move in right away,
get him out of your hair.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.631
Uh... um...

16:06.633 --> 16:08.633
On second thought,

16:08.635 --> 16:10.635
you may want to look into
Andre's felony convictions.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.637
I mean, I really shouldn't be
the person who's saying this.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.072
I'm sorry, did you say felony?
Bye.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.807
Oh. Work.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.508
And I told them that
I should take it easy.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.210
Like you said.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.846
You're doing the right thing.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.517
(crickets chirping)

16:26.519 --> 16:29.921
So you told
the landlord...

16:29.923 --> 16:33.091
that Andre was a...
a convicted felon.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.592
Yeah.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.927
Yeah, I did.

16:35.929 --> 16:39.430
And that was just so he could
keep making you salads?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.432
Well, I mean, he's been doing

16:41.434 --> 16:43.434
a lot of other stuff
around the house too, babe.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.436
Right.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.206
That didn't make you feel guilty
at all, saying that about him?

16:48.208 --> 16:51.642
Um...

16:51.644 --> 16:53.044
No?

16:53.046 --> 16:55.546
No, I feel pretty good about it.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.983
Okay, that, uh...

16:58.985 --> 17:00.218
that makes sense.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.986
Mm.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.355
Night.
(cell phone buzzes)

17:06.726 --> 17:08.693
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.028
Ugh.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.362
Oh, man.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.897
Say hi to Dean.

17:12.899 --> 17:17.535
I can't wait to hear why
this had to happen outside.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.538
Because I didn't want
to trespass.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.873
Because I no longer
live here.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.874
Seriously?

17:22.876 --> 17:24.709
Dean... (scoffs)

17:24.711 --> 17:26.244
aren't you taking
this a little far?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.813
I just want to be totally
honest, full disclosure,

17:28.815 --> 17:30.481
so you don't hear it
from anyone else.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.849
Hear what from anyone else?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.052
I met with another firm.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.887
Really?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.355
What... firm?

17:37.357 --> 17:39.357
I met with Huston Rozz
and Patrice Landy

17:39.359 --> 17:41.826
of the law firm
Rozz/Landy & Associates.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.028
Why?
They want me to practice law.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.998
For their firm. With full
in-court speaking privileges.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Dean, we talked about this,
you can't speak in court

17:49.002 --> 17:50.601
until you pass the bar.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.403
They had an interesting
take on the bar.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.571
"Skip it."

17:53.573 --> 17:54.672
That is an interesting take.
Yeah.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.507
And they were
a little surprised

17:56.509 --> 17:58.709
that my brother hadn't figured
out a bar work-around.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.112
Dean, the legal profession
is very clear on this.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.082
Take the test, pass the
test, become a lawyer.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.516
Well, they seem
to think that eight years

18:05.518 --> 18:08.419
of television experience
was sufficient.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.089
I'm inclined
to agree with them.
Then what's stopping you?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.390
Maybe nothing.
You want to work
for Rozz and Landy,

18:12.392 --> 18:13.791
then work for
Rozz and Landy.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.893
Maybe I will.
Is this all

18:15.895 --> 18:17.762
just because I asked you
what the long-term plan was?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.231
You-you can't be an
adult about anything.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.233
You know, it turns into
this whole big deal,

18:22.235 --> 18:24.735
you move out, and now
everyone's mad at me.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.371
Admit it, you never wanted me
to be a partner in the firm.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.806
Yes, I admit it.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.908
I've admitted that since
the second you got here.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.477
What about all the business
I brought in?

18:32.479 --> 18:34.078
What about all
the cases we won?

18:34.080 --> 18:36.080
You said it yourself--
we were a great team.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.082
I brought the style,
and you brought the legal stuff.

18:38.084 --> 18:40.118
We were unstoppable.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.555
Or did you forget that?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.158
Take care of Andre for me.
I will not do that.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.727
Because he's gay?
Because he's a grown man.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.265
See you around, brother.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.067
Okay, Dean.

18:56.069 --> 18:57.602
I'll see you around.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.904
You know your car's here.
I don't understand.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.839
He drove here just to walk away?
That doesn't make s-sense.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.481
What is this?

19:10.483 --> 19:13.317
Is this plain eggs,
not an omelet?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.986
Okay...
Where's the cilantro?

19:14.988 --> 19:17.321
And the avocado toast?
Guys...

19:17.323 --> 19:18.256
Andre?
Ethan.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.357
Andre!

19:19.359 --> 19:20.358
Ethan, take it easy.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.927
Andre is not here anymore.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.795
What?!
Why?!

19:24.797 --> 19:26.497
I got a little
too attached to Andre.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.032
Your mother lied
to a lot of people.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.200
Mom...?

19:29.202 --> 19:31.035
Well, I did sabotage him,

19:31.037 --> 19:33.271
so that he could not get a job
or a decent place to live.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.773
Where... is he?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.175
He's doing good.

19:37.177 --> 19:40.211
I had to cosign on
an apartment for him,

19:40.213 --> 19:44.815
but at a nice place,
uh, and it's far away from here,

19:44.817 --> 19:46.851
and it's-it's not our house.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.953
I don't want to know where.
I wouldn't tell
you if you asked.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.389
So you kicked him out.
Just like you kicked out
Uncle Dean.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.291
No, it's not...
Guys...

19:53.293 --> 19:54.692
Is anyone safe?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.961
I hope you're happy.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.963
Uh... (scoffs)

19:58.965 --> 20:00.364
I mean, maybe
we could just...

20:00.366 --> 20:01.832
Deb, he's gone.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.668
Fine.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.170
STEWART:<i> I promise you</i>
<i> Dean is not leaving the firm.</i>

20:06.172 --> 20:08.239
I don't know, Stew.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.874
It's not like Dean
to be this late.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.709
That's true, he's
usually later.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.844
What if he went night-hiking
and fell in the ravine?

20:13.846 --> 20:15.846
He could just be laying there
with a broken leg

20:15.848 --> 20:17.215
and no cell service.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.516
Can we please lay off

20:18.518 --> 20:19.684
the random worst-case
scenarios, Todd?

20:19.686 --> 20:21.919
Oh, there he is.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.855
See?
Good morning,
team Sanderson & Yao.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.357
Dean, you're late.
The judge wants to start.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.159
We talked about
being on ti--

20:28.161 --> 20:30.027
Or we could hug first.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.163
I was hoping you'd chase me.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.898
Where?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.768
Anywhere.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.773
Dad, I'm sorry.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.676
Sometimes a young bird
needs to spread his wings.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.678
I understand, son,

20:47.680 --> 20:50.581
because that's how young birds
learn how to fly.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.330
I'm coming with you.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.734
Screw you. Screw you.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.035
Screw you guys!

21:11.037 --> 21:13.337
No.
No.

21:14.807 --> 21:18.042
Well, thank you
for your consideration.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.443
Sorry.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.711
Sorry.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.713
Sorry, I'm staying here.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.749
Just scratch that
from the record.

21:24.751 --> 21:29.487
Happy to be here. I'm...

What if our work, the X-Files,

Then do something
