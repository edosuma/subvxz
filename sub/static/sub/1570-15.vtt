Haley, care to join
our patriotic sing-along?

09:45.755 --> 09:46.622
I'm sorry, Dad.

09:46.656 --> 09:48.057
But you're not fooling anyone.

09:48.091 --> 09:49.291
You've been brainwashed.

09:49.326 --> 09:50.426
And I have proof.

09:50.460 --> 09:51.860
What are you talking about?

09:51.895 --> 09:53.262
I followed Dad today.

09:53.296 --> 09:54.396
Here's a picture of him

09:54.431 --> 09:55.931
giving all of his clothes

09:55.966 --> 09:57.199
to a homeless man.

09:57.234 --> 09:58.734
It looks like he's being robbed.

10:01.071 --> 10:02.938
What?!
It's true.

10:02.973 --> 10:04.640
I was robbed by a homeless.

10:04.674 --> 10:05.641
Haley!

10:05.675 --> 10:07.009
Your father was getting mugged

10:07.043 --> 10:09.178
and you just sat there,
snapping photos?

10:09.212 --> 10:10.513
Hilarious.

10:10.547 --> 10:12.882
I-I swear,
he didn't have a gun.

10:12.916 --> 10:16.018
Dad, you may be able
to use your CIA tech

10:16.052 --> 10:18.354
to hack my phone
and doctor a photo,

10:18.388 --> 10:21.056
but you can't doctor real life.

10:21.091 --> 10:23.058
(eagle screeches)

10:23.093 --> 10:25.261
But... that was
a peace sign.

10:25.295 --> 10:26.862
Oh, I see why you're confused.

10:26.897 --> 10:29.532
Reagan's just at peace
shredding waves.

10:29.566 --> 10:30.432
I'm not crazy.

10:30.467 --> 10:32.635
I know what I saw.

10:32.669 --> 10:34.436
Oh, I've got some
bad news, guys.

10:34.471 --> 10:35.804
I have to sell the piano.

10:35.839 --> 10:37.973
ALL:
Aw.

10:40.510 --> 10:42.511
(moaning softly)

10:44.114 --> 10:46.615
Sorry, I'll be out of
your hair in a minute.

10:46.650 --> 10:48.284
Just looking for a flashlight.

10:48.318 --> 10:49.952
Oh, here it is.
(chuckles)

10:49.986 --> 10:53.255
Shadow puppet

10:53.290 --> 10:56.592
(mimicking water splashing)

10:56.626 --> 10:57.993
It's all in the pinky.

10:58.028 --> 11:00.362
(moaning)
What's wrong, little buddy?

11:00.397 --> 11:02.698
I'm ruined!
All these candles!

11:02.732 --> 11:04.700
You can't find
anyone to buy them?

11:04.734 --> 11:06.368
I offered them
to Yankee Candles,

11:06.403 --> 11:08.170
but they said
they had enough candles.

11:08.205 --> 11:09.905
I don't understand business!

11:09.940 --> 11:11.307
Don't give up, Roger.

11:11.341 --> 11:13.442
You just got to look on the...

11:13.476 --> 11:15.444
bright side.

11:15.478 --> 11:16.946
(chuckles) (chuckles)

11:16.980 --> 11:19.481
Oh, it feels good to laugh.

11:19.516 --> 11:22.284
Thanks for reminding me how.

11:25.355 --> 11:26.822
It's like I'm looking at you

11:26.857 --> 11:28.824
through the eyes
of Vilmos Zsigmond,

11:28.859 --> 11:31.026
cinematographer
of <i> Close Encounters.</i>

11:31.061 --> 11:32.628
I know Vilmos.

11:32.662 --> 11:35.865
I was his favorite extra.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.769
God, there's so much
I don't know about you.

11:40.804 --> 11:42.972
I should probably go.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.240
Why?

11:44.274 --> 11:46.742
Two friends lit by candlelight.

11:46.776 --> 11:48.744
What could go wrong?

11:48.778 --> 11:50.613
The question is...

11:50.647 --> 11:53.883
what could go right?

11:53.917 --> 11:57.353
How 'bout I light a few more?

12:00.891 --> 12:03.893
(whistling)

12:05.695 --> 12:07.696
(door shuts)

12:10.600 --> 12:12.701
All right, Stan Smith,

12:12.736 --> 12:15.504
let's see what you're hiding.

12:26.550 --> 12:28.517
KLAUS:
Sorry, Hayley.

12:28.552 --> 12:32.288
Sorry you picked a fish
for your stupid plan.

12:32.322 --> 12:34.290
No, Dad!

12:34.324 --> 12:36.625
I can't let you do this.
What do you mean?

12:36.660 --> 12:39.428
I saw your computer screen.
I know you were searching

12:39.462 --> 12:42.031
for "Secret Back Roads
to National Monuments."

12:42.065 --> 12:44.533
(chuckling):
Oh, Hayley, Hayley, Hayley.

12:44.568 --> 12:47.069
I've been planning a road trip
for the family

12:47.103 --> 12:49.438
to see all of our country's
greatest monuments.

12:49.473 --> 12:51.707
And of course we'll take
the secret back roads.

12:51.741 --> 12:53.976
You always want to enter a park
from behind.

12:54.010 --> 12:56.712
Not many parks will let you,
but if you find one that will,

12:56.746 --> 12:58.581
they'll pretty much
let you do anything.

12:58.615 --> 13:00.015
Dad, one of the Web sites was

13:00.050 --> 13:01.851
"How to Blow Up
National Monuments."

13:01.885 --> 13:04.119
Hayley, Hayley, Hayley.

13:04.154 --> 13:06.055
"Blow Up." It's street jive.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.390
It means
to make something popular.

13:08.425 --> 13:10.793
Attendance at the national
monuments is dwindling,

13:10.827 --> 13:12.995
baby girl, and Daddy's worried.

13:13.029 --> 13:14.330
Okay...

13:14.364 --> 13:16.465
I-I guess
that makes sense.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.868
Um, just one more question.

13:18.902 --> 13:22.471
Why is there a crate
of missiles tied to your car?

13:22.506 --> 13:25.875
Hayley, Hayley, Hayley.

13:25.909 --> 13:27.943
(screams)

13:27.978 --> 13:30.412
You just couldn't let it rest,
could you?

13:30.447 --> 13:31.747
(groaning)

13:31.781 --> 13:33.783
(groaning continues)

13:35.185 --> 13:37.486
Damn, Hayley, how
much do you weigh?

13:39.923 --> 13:42.091
Daddy?

13:42.125 --> 13:43.225
What's going on?

13:43.260 --> 13:44.360
You were right, Hayley.

13:44.394 --> 13:46.695
I'm a warrior now
for the liberal left,

13:46.730 --> 13:48.864
and we're about to move forward
with an attack

13:48.899 --> 13:50.733
that the world's right-wing
puppet masters

13:50.767 --> 13:52.434
will never forget.

13:54.304 --> 13:55.738
Oh, by the way,
these are my friends

13:55.772 --> 13:57.706
who kidnapped
and brainwashed me.

13:57.741 --> 13:59.241
This one's a wheelchair guy,

13:59.276 --> 14:01.243
but he can still talk
and everything.

14:03.024 --> 14:05.025
(owl hooting, insects trilling)

14:07.128 --> 14:08.762
Dad, what are you gonna do?

14:08.796 --> 14:09.963
Are you...

14:09.998 --> 14:11.765
are you gonna blow up
Mount Rushmore?

14:11.799 --> 14:13.100
Oh, no. Way cooler.

14:13.134 --> 14:15.135
Artemis, show her.

14:17.369 --> 14:19.449
ARTEMIS: By precisely targeting
a barrage of missiles

14:19.474 --> 14:21.441
your dad acquired for us,
we'll reshape

14:21.476 --> 14:23.510
the contemptible fascists
of Mount Rushmore

14:23.545 --> 14:25.412
into history's
greatest leftists.

14:25.446 --> 14:28.949
STAN: Sean Penn, Michael Moore
and Captain Planet.

14:28.983 --> 14:30.617
HAYLEY:
Why didn't you change Jefferson?

14:30.652 --> 14:32.252
STAN:
Well, he freed the slaves, so...

14:32.287 --> 14:33.787
he stays.

14:34.823 --> 14:37.191
I can't believe this.

14:37.225 --> 14:38.492
We're going through
with this, Hayley.

14:38.526 --> 14:40.360
No use trying
to talk me out of it.

14:40.395 --> 14:41.628
I'm not going to.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.030
I think it's awesome.

14:43.064 --> 14:45.699
Really?
Dad, this is exactly what I've been trying

14:45.733 --> 14:47.801
to get you to embrace
all these years.

14:47.836 --> 14:50.137
Now we can work together
to bring down the...

14:50.171 --> 14:51.505
HAYLEY & STAN:
Plutocratic, patriarchal,

14:51.539 --> 14:53.340
military industrial complex!

14:53.374 --> 14:54.942
(squeals)

14:54.976 --> 14:57.611
I can't wait to help
you guys pull this off,

14:57.645 --> 14:59.780
but, um, can I go
to the bathroom real quick?

14:59.814 --> 15:01.882
I'm going to enjoy
a movement of my own.

15:01.916 --> 15:04.017
Clever!

15:09.224 --> 15:10.657
(keypad beeps, line rings)

15:10.692 --> 15:12.459
Hello?
(quietly): Avery, it's Hayley.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.595
I have to talk to you.
I was kidnapped.

15:14.629 --> 15:17.865
Stop right there.
Let me switch to a secure line.

15:17.899 --> 15:19.266
All right.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.870
When you were kidnapped,
what were you wearing?

15:22.904 --> 15:25.606
Do you currently
have access to your nipples?

15:25.640 --> 15:29.610
What? N-No, Avery, I-I was
kidnapped by terrorists.

15:29.644 --> 15:32.746
Oh, my God, you're so bad
at sexy phone calls.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.248
Damn it!

15:34.282 --> 15:36.049
Come on, come on, come on.

15:36.084 --> 15:40.120
Mmm. I don't know where your
back ends and my hands begin.

15:40.155 --> 15:43.123
(phone rings)
Oh! The outside world.

15:43.158 --> 15:45.659
Hello?
(quietly): Roger, it's Hayley.

15:45.693 --> 15:47.694
Look, I've been
kidnapped by my dad.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.129
He's working with terrorists...

15:49.164 --> 15:51.064
Hayley, my hands are dripping
with coconut oil.

15:51.099 --> 15:52.232
I can't talk.

15:54.068 --> 15:56.303
Now, where were we?

15:56.337 --> 15:59.106
Oh... yeah, here.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.108
(moaning)

16:01.142 --> 16:03.544
FRANCINE:
Steve? Roger?

16:03.578 --> 16:05.579
Are you up there?

16:06.915 --> 16:09.049
What? Wh-What have
we been doing?!

16:09.083 --> 16:11.385
I-It must have been
the candles, right?

16:11.419 --> 16:13.554
Get out.

16:13.588 --> 16:14.888
(keypad beeps, line rings)

16:14.923 --> 16:17.224
(gasps)
WOMAN: 911, what is your emergency?

16:17.258 --> 16:19.626
(gasps) Betraitor!

16:21.930 --> 16:23.397
All right, Stan.

16:23.431 --> 16:26.066
Finish setting up the launcher
while we go get high for this.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.636
I want to be as high
as I was during <i> Life of Pi.</i>

16:33.575 --> 16:36.076
Dad, don't do this.
This isn't you.

16:36.110 --> 16:37.744
Hayley, you should be happy.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.880
I'm a leftist radical,
just like you are.

16:39.914 --> 16:41.949
But that's not who you are.

16:41.983 --> 16:44.284
You've always hated
my liberal ideas.

16:44.319 --> 16:46.954
Remember how mad you got when I
filled your gas tank with sugar

16:46.988 --> 16:49.223
to encourage you
to ride my bike to work?

16:51.593 --> 16:55.562
The chain kept coming off and I
had to ask a weird man for help.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.066
Yeah. Yeah!

16:59.100 --> 17:01.468
It made you really mad,
didn't it?

17:01.503 --> 17:05.405
But, but I did reduce my carbon
footprint for two days, so...

17:05.440 --> 17:06.473
well done.

17:06.508 --> 17:08.809
Okay, but remember
how upset you got

17:08.843 --> 17:11.244
when my fourth grade teacher
asked what you did on Career Day

17:11.279 --> 17:14.414
<i>and I said you introduced crack</i>
<i>and AIDS to the ghetto?</i>

17:14.449 --> 17:17.416
I've told you time and again
that AIDS was the FBI.

17:17.452 --> 17:19.819
But, but it's good
to be sensitive

17:19.854 --> 17:22.923
to the socioeconomically
disadvantaged and their pain.

17:22.957 --> 17:24.925
Yeah? Well, what about <i> your</i> pain

17:24.959 --> 17:27.394
when me and my friends protested
on our front lawn

17:27.428 --> 17:28.862
for four months?

17:31.399 --> 17:33.233
I'd just had that lawn seeded.

17:33.268 --> 17:35.102
All those hippies urinating...

17:35.136 --> 17:38.105
But, but I guess
you did raise awareness for...

17:38.139 --> 17:40.140
for...

17:41.543 --> 17:42.776
...for nothing!

17:42.811 --> 17:44.645
It wasn't even clear
what you were protesting!

17:44.679 --> 17:46.847
Were you against soap?
Getting jobs?

17:46.881 --> 17:48.515
Having sex in private?!

17:48.550 --> 17:50.651
All right, Stan, we're ready.

17:50.685 --> 17:51.985
Launch the missiles.

17:52.020 --> 17:54.655
Launch? I-I...

17:54.689 --> 17:56.723
I can't.

17:56.758 --> 17:58.659
Why not? Are you all right?

17:58.693 --> 17:59.660
Yes.

17:59.694 --> 18:01.528
You had me all left.

18:01.563 --> 18:03.964
But now I'm all right.

18:03.998 --> 18:06.767
I don't understand.
What's he... Oh, I get it.

18:06.801 --> 18:09.503
He's using "right"
in the political sense.

18:09.537 --> 18:11.839
(gasps) His brainwashing's
been compromised!

18:11.873 --> 18:13.540
Seize him!

18:14.576 --> 18:16.043
(grunts)

18:17.746 --> 18:19.746
(grunting)

18:23.785 --> 18:26.286
(grunting)

18:28.056 --> 18:30.357
Dude! You wouldn't hurt a guy
in a wheelchair.

18:30.391 --> 18:31.558
Of course not.

18:31.593 --> 18:34.328
But I would hurt a guy
<i>with</i> his wheelchair.

18:34.362 --> 18:37.197
(grunting, moaning)

18:37.232 --> 18:39.433
(panting)

18:39.467 --> 18:41.368
Dad? Are you really back?

18:41.403 --> 18:42.836
Yes, Hayley, I am.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.838
It seems the only
force strong enough

18:44.873 --> 18:46.173
to break their brainwashing

18:46.207 --> 18:49.176
was a lifetime of
disappointment in my daughter.

18:49.210 --> 18:50.677
It is you!

18:50.712 --> 18:52.546
Dad!

18:53.615 --> 18:54.915
(beeping)

18:57.285 --> 18:59.620
Oh, no!
What have I done?

19:16.604 --> 19:18.906
What... what the hell
just happened?

19:21.176 --> 19:22.676
Well done, Smith.

19:22.710 --> 19:24.411
Or should I say, Smiths.

19:24.446 --> 19:25.779
Deputy Director Bullock?

19:25.814 --> 19:27.214
Let me explain.

19:27.248 --> 19:29.049
We needed
to test Mount Rushmore's

19:29.084 --> 19:31.118
new anti-missile
laser defense,

19:31.152 --> 19:33.754
so we figured
the easiest way to do that

19:33.788 --> 19:36.657
would be to brainwash
our most loyal agent

19:36.691 --> 19:38.492
into firing missiles at it.

19:38.526 --> 19:39.927
Really?
That was the easiest way?

19:39.961 --> 19:41.261
No.

19:41.296 --> 19:44.732
But South Dakota had a lot
of Homeland Security funds

19:44.766 --> 19:46.667
just sitting around,
so we figured

19:46.701 --> 19:48.635
we should do
something cool with it.

19:48.670 --> 19:50.404
Are you insane?!

19:50.438 --> 19:53.240
Millions of kids go to bed
hungry every night,

19:53.274 --> 19:56.643
but you waste money making
Abe Lincoln into a Transformer?

19:56.678 --> 19:58.112
God, you're annoying.

19:58.146 --> 19:59.680
Everything you say is annoying.

19:59.714 --> 20:01.014
This guy gets it.

20:01.049 --> 20:03.884
Smith, let me introduce you
to the CIA agents

20:03.918 --> 20:06.787
who pretended to be
anticapitalist activists

20:06.821 --> 20:09.089
so they could kidnap
and brainwash you.

20:10.592 --> 20:11.792
Duper?!

20:11.826 --> 20:13.193
Jackson?!

20:13.228 --> 20:15.696
Oh, my God,
those disguises are amazing!

20:15.730 --> 20:17.231
That's because they're made

20:17.265 --> 20:19.299
with real skin from the Orient.

20:19.334 --> 20:21.535
Wait a minute, then-then
who was playing Artemis?

20:21.569 --> 20:24.038
Oh, he was actually
a dangerous activist.

20:24.072 --> 20:25.706
So good job beating
him to death.

20:25.740 --> 20:28.542
He did have a child that may
come for vengeance someday,

20:28.576 --> 20:30.344
but he's also in a wheelchair,

20:30.378 --> 20:32.413
so walk halfway up a staircase

20:32.447 --> 20:34.548
or find a curb, you'll be fine.

20:38.253 --> 20:41.121
Well, Dad, it really
is good to have you back.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.057
It's good to be back, Hayley.

20:43.091 --> 20:45.125
Come on, let's go home.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.960
Well, we've got a long
drive ahead of us.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.429
What are we gonna talk about?

20:48.463 --> 20:49.596
Not much.

20:49.988 --> 20:54.805
