You were always well cared for.

17:48.790 --> 17:52.626
Father loved his secret son more
than he did Trista and myself.

17:53.628 --> 17:57.031
It is wonderful
to see you again, Love.

17:57.065 --> 18:00.034
Still tiny, still all...

18:00.068 --> 18:01.869
spit and wit.

18:01.903 --> 18:04.905
Yes.

18:04.940 --> 18:07.773
You as well.

18:09.609 --> 18:11.577
I only wish
our meeting

18:11.611 --> 18:15.781
was inspired by kinship
and not bloodshed.

18:16.783 --> 18:20.086
And it is
a reasonable assumption

18:20.120 --> 18:22.421
that you do not flaunt
your brotherly ties to the Wolf

18:22.456 --> 18:24.423
at noble dinners?

18:24.458 --> 18:28.093
No one is aware.

18:28.127 --> 18:30.428
Although Isabel
would recognize you.

18:30.463 --> 18:34.766
Your hair and
beard are unruly

18:34.800 --> 18:37.970
and filthy...

18:40.206 --> 18:43.842
...but you still have the face
of that teenage boy.

18:44.844 --> 18:48.313
That boy died
many deaths since.

18:48.348 --> 18:51.815
As well as hundreds
of other innocent boys.

18:51.850 --> 18:54.451
Such is the nature
of rebellion.

18:55.487 --> 18:58.789
A sad and bloody truth.

18:58.823 --> 19:02.626
A truth we must change, Gruffy.

19:02.660 --> 19:03.928
That...

19:03.962 --> 19:09.132
is what the Byth Encil wishes
for, Love, change.

19:09.166 --> 19:13.136
An independent Wales
is my greatest wish as well.

19:13.170 --> 19:15.305
But that change will never
happen blade against blade.

19:15.339 --> 19:17.807
You're smart enough
to know that.

19:17.841 --> 19:20.810
It must happen at a table
with men and women

19:20.844 --> 19:24.147
of even temper and open heart.

19:24.181 --> 19:27.317
When you find these men
and women,

19:27.351 --> 19:29.184
I'll openly pull up my chair.

19:30.353 --> 19:33.322
I did not start
this revolution, Love.

19:33.356 --> 19:36.325
Longshanks planted
that seed of hate years ago,

19:36.359 --> 19:40.329
ripping from our hearts
our most sacred title and crown,

19:40.363 --> 19:43.232
placing it on the empty head
of his own frivolous son,

19:43.266 --> 19:48.103
the first Prince of Wales
never to speak a word of Welsh.

19:49.239 --> 19:51.039
Our history may still burn us,
brother,

19:51.073 --> 19:53.542
- but you lead the Byth Encil now.
- (sighs)

19:53.576 --> 19:56.878
You guide the efforts
that never retreat.

19:56.913 --> 19:58.246
(chuckles)

19:58.280 --> 20:01.215
I must confess, sister,

20:01.250 --> 20:03.084
I am more legend than law.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.054
Half the rebel attacks
are made by men I have never led

20:06.088 --> 20:07.889
or even met.
Including the one

20:07.924 --> 20:12.259
on you on Penfras Mawr.
I am so sorry for that.

20:15.964 --> 20:19.099
A revolution with no leader
is chaos.

20:19.133 --> 20:21.602
Blood spilled with no purpose.

20:21.636 --> 20:23.270
- To no end...
- And that is why

20:23.304 --> 20:26.440
I bagged you today, Love.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.309
I need money
to organize these men.

20:29.344 --> 20:32.144
If I can provide food,
shelter, weapons,

20:32.179 --> 20:34.447
care for their families,
they'll become loyal soldiers,

20:34.482 --> 20:36.449
subject to sound command.

20:36.484 --> 20:39.352
You want me to fund
your revolution?

20:40.821 --> 20:44.791
I know you were able to hide
family heirlooms from Ventris.

20:44.825 --> 20:47.326
Jewelry, chalices,

20:47.361 --> 20:48.995
noble
medals.

20:49.029 --> 20:51.364
How do you know...

20:51.398 --> 20:53.366
Oh, yes, the crypt.

20:56.803 --> 21:00.772
It was the only way I could
visit my father at the castle.

21:00.807 --> 21:04.610
We spent many hours amongst
our dead ancestors, talking,

21:04.644 --> 21:07.113
reading. I know the magic
that room possesses.

21:07.147 --> 21:09.281
Then why not just creep
in the dead of night

21:09.316 --> 21:11.317
and take what you desire?

21:11.351 --> 21:14.786
I may be an unruly, filthy,
rebel bastard,

21:14.821 --> 21:16.454
but I'm not a thief.

21:16.489 --> 21:19.825
And I have no right
to that history.

21:19.859 --> 21:22.995
I know how sacred
those things are to you.

21:23.029 --> 21:28.333
I am asking you to
bestow one to me.

21:28.367 --> 21:29.501
A gift.

21:29.536 --> 21:32.237
To help our beloved Wales.

21:33.372 --> 21:36.174
Were you there,
in the grass fields,

21:36.208 --> 21:38.876
when my husband was killed?

21:41.380 --> 21:43.348
I was.

21:43.382 --> 21:46.351
But another took his life.

21:46.385 --> 21:49.387
A warrior that once served Erik.

21:49.422 --> 21:52.557
An honorable man.

21:56.361 --> 21:58.362
(sighs)

21:59.531 --> 22:01.331
I will wait for you
in the under passage.

22:01.366 --> 22:03.367
After compline.

22:03.401 --> 22:08.872
If you cannot help,
I'll hold no ill will, sister.

22:10.041 --> 22:13.343
And if I do not give up
our precious history,

22:13.378 --> 22:16.912
will that end all talk of peace?

22:33.964 --> 22:35.731
JESSAMY: You are just
in time, my love.

22:35.765 --> 22:37.599
Supper's
nearly served.

22:41.604 --> 22:43.572
I need you to sit

22:43.606 --> 22:45.273
and listen.

22:52.615 --> 22:55.383
It is pressing.

22:57.553 --> 22:59.020
Stay,
boy.

22:59.054 --> 23:01.523
You need to hear this.

23:01.557 --> 23:05.226
What troubles you, Maddy?

23:05.260 --> 23:07.894
That is not my name.

23:07.929 --> 23:12.065
I'm not quite sure why you hold
onto this lie the way you do.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.568
There is no lie, husband.

23:14.603 --> 23:16.303
Stop!

23:19.774 --> 23:21.575
I am not your husband.

23:21.610 --> 23:24.411
Nor am I an executioner.

23:24.446 --> 23:27.080
All in this room
know that truth.

23:27.115 --> 23:30.584
As well
as our chamberlain.

23:30.619 --> 23:32.952
Corbett holds that secret
over my head,

23:32.986 --> 23:34.454
threatens the lives
of all of you

23:34.488 --> 23:36.156
if I do not willingly commit
his sins.

23:36.190 --> 23:38.658
You commit no sins, Maddy.

23:38.692 --> 23:40.627
(sighs)

23:40.661 --> 23:43.630
All I do is commit sin.

23:43.664 --> 23:46.332
You are pious.
In service of God...

23:49.170 --> 23:51.804
(sighs)

23:51.838 --> 23:55.941
I murdered an honored knight
this morn.

23:58.445 --> 24:01.246
One of the men responsible
for killing my wife

24:01.281 --> 24:04.616
and unborn-unborn child.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.489
That is the thing
that brought me here.

24:10.523 --> 24:12.824
Revenge is why I stayed.

24:12.858 --> 24:15.294
You are speaking such madness.

24:15.328 --> 24:16.628
Madness

24:16.663 --> 24:18.797
will happen if we're not gone

24:18.831 --> 24:21.833
before this noble's blood
falls on my hands.

24:21.867 --> 24:24.303
We need to leave
this place.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.804
Tonight.

24:25.838 --> 24:29.641
Or Corbett will most certainly
make examples of us all.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.642
(crying)

24:31.677 --> 24:35.346
Why are you doing this to us?

24:38.684 --> 24:41.151
(sighs)

24:41.186 --> 24:43.187
(crying)

24:44.389 --> 24:46.357
I'm sorry you were pulled

24:46.391 --> 24:48.359
into this.

24:48.393 --> 24:51.028
Your heart compelled you
to help me,

24:51.062 --> 24:53.698
and I will be forever grateful.

24:53.732 --> 24:57.167
But now I need to protect you.

24:57.202 --> 25:00.137
This is our home, husband.

25:00.171 --> 25:01.138
Our children...

25:01.172 --> 25:02.806
(crying)

25:02.841 --> 25:04.674
Please.

25:08.678 --> 25:10.646
Yes.

25:10.680 --> 25:15.317
And if you want to save
our children, you must...

25:15.352 --> 25:17.553
do what I say.

25:20.557 --> 25:23.525
Pack only which is most needed.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.896
Some dry goods
and water as well.

25:26.930 --> 25:30.066
Be ready to travel after dark.

25:36.239 --> 25:38.240
Jessamy.

25:39.242 --> 25:42.711
Jessamy.

25:42.746 --> 25:43.712
(door shuts)

25:43.747 --> 25:45.748
(sighs)

25:46.750 --> 25:48.717
I'll pack what we need, Father,

25:48.752 --> 25:50.919
and see that Mother is ready.

25:51.954 --> 25:54.490
Thank you, Luca.

25:55.558 --> 25:57.526
Once we are safe,

25:57.560 --> 26:01.897
will you leave us?
No longer be my father?

26:10.406 --> 26:13.408
I will never be your father.

26:14.443 --> 26:17.545
Not of birth.

26:17.579 --> 26:20.615
But I'll not leave you, son.

26:27.623 --> 26:29.624
(indistinct chatter)

26:37.165 --> 26:38.799
(quietly): You take
the wife and children

26:38.834 --> 26:41.268
and ride to the old
Aberffraw fortress.

26:41.303 --> 26:43.770
But I should be here,
in the fight.

26:43.805 --> 26:45.605
Keeping those innocents alive

26:45.640 --> 26:47.774
is the most important
thing to Wilkin.

26:47.809 --> 26:50.276
He's trusted you
with that task.

26:50.311 --> 26:53.613
Then I'll not let
anything harm them.

26:53.648 --> 26:55.215
Good.

26:55.249 --> 26:57.250
Then we can take our vengeance
to Leon

26:57.284 --> 26:59.753
and the four we know were
at West River Riding.

26:59.787 --> 27:02.656
But we still don't know for
sure who killed our families.

27:04.625 --> 27:08.628
We are certain
they were part of the massacre.

27:09.629 --> 27:12.798
Trust they killed
someone you loved.

27:22.141 --> 27:26.111
Are you certain you're
able to do this, Isabel?

27:26.145 --> 27:29.114
I have asked for your
confidence so much as of late.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.483
That is my service, Love.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.818
Knowing you have opened the door
to a potential peace

27:33.853 --> 27:37.655
gives me great joy and an even
deeper admiration for my lady.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.858
(chuckles)

27:41.560 --> 27:44.696
Baroness, we were heavy
with worry.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.498
I am so sorry, Sir Locke.

27:46.532 --> 27:49.701
I was showing Isabel a
favorite childhood spot of mine.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.871
Seems time slipped away.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.106
A favored spot in
these woods, my lady?

27:55.140 --> 27:58.610
Yes. North.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.111
There is a clearing,

28:00.145 --> 28:02.614
with a quite
lovely...

28:02.648 --> 28:04.482
Bog.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.651
A deep, mysterious bog.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.653
With strange mud and...

28:08.687 --> 28:10.654
Do take us home,
good knights.

28:10.688 --> 28:12.856
We've had our
fill of memories.

28:17.695 --> 28:19.663
Bog?

28:19.697 --> 28:22.499
Sorry.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.868
(indistinct chatter)

28:29.706 --> 28:31.341
Your father about, lad?

28:31.375 --> 28:32.675
No, sir.

28:32.709 --> 28:34.210
LEON:
When he returns,

28:34.245 --> 28:37.047
tell him our
chamberlain needs him.

28:37.081 --> 28:38.381
A pressing matter.

28:38.416 --> 28:39.416
Yes, sir.

28:44.422 --> 28:48.224
(quietly): What if the blame for
Huxley's death falls to rebels

28:48.259 --> 28:50.726
or desertion? _

28:50.761 --> 28:54.998
- Is it not wise to wait before
we risk such peril? - Huxley left

28:55.032 --> 28:56.999
with Toran and I.

28:57.033 --> 28:59.836
When he does not show up
for drink and whores,

28:59.870 --> 29:01.671
the knights will come
looking for us.

29:01.705 --> 29:02.705
Shh.

29:03.874 --> 29:05.675
Moor.

29:05.709 --> 29:08.344
The Roman verses.
Are they transcribed?

29:08.378 --> 29:10.012
No.

29:10.046 --> 29:12.548
There are hundreds of pages.

29:12.583 --> 29:16.285
And yet you have time
for idle conversation.

29:18.622 --> 29:20.590
You are the punisher.

29:20.624 --> 29:23.759
Yea. Gawain Maddox.

29:23.794 --> 29:26.896
I'm afraid
I don't know your name.

29:26.930 --> 29:29.064
This is true.

29:29.099 --> 29:30.432
You do not.

29:32.969 --> 29:35.270
To the quill, Moor.

29:36.272 --> 29:38.240
My superior.

29:38.274 --> 29:41.743
In his seventh year of 23.

29:41.777 --> 29:44.113
Payment for his crime.

29:44.147 --> 29:46.948
He will die
with a quill in his hand.

29:46.983 --> 29:50.819
You will never see that fate,
brother.

29:50.853 --> 29:53.288
That is why we must use
this misfortune

29:53.323 --> 29:56.625
to set fire to our revenge
and take flight from this place.

29:56.659 --> 29:59.161
Yes.

29:59.195 --> 30:01.696
I will be ready.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.667
"This shall be the
law of the leper

30:06.701 --> 30:08.669
in the day of
his cleansing."

30:14.343 --> 30:17.045
"And the priest shall go forth

30:17.079 --> 30:20.048
out of the camp and shall look,

30:20.082 --> 30:24.519
and behold,
if the plague of leprosy

30:24.553 --> 30:27.422
be healed..."

30:28.557 --> 30:31.692
The market does not trade today,
healer.

30:31.726 --> 30:34.394
I am here to see you, Father.

30:37.932 --> 30:42.902
Let us take some quiet time
to think about our lesson.

30:42.937 --> 30:45.405
Heads on hands.

30:50.945 --> 30:53.613
How may I be of help?

31:03.891 --> 31:07.560
I do not deal
in remedies, woman.

31:09.930 --> 31:12.198
These are not to heal.

31:12.232 --> 31:14.734
They are to warn.

31:14.768 --> 31:16.903
An omen.

31:16.937 --> 31:19.872
A danger comes to this court,

31:19.907 --> 31:21.107
a darkness.

31:25.946 --> 31:30.449
It is not wise to show
your pagan hand so openly.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.088
Leviticus.

31:35.122 --> 31:38.457
Chapter 14,
verses two and three.

31:40.293 --> 31:43.929
Would a pagan hand
know the touch

31:43.963 --> 31:46.999
of every page in your Bible?

31:50.470 --> 31:52.638
(gasps)

32:05.924 --> 32:07.492
The crown of thorns.

32:17.996 --> 32:21.633
You will know the evil
when you see it.

32:23.135 --> 32:26.137
God will guide you
to the task.

32:46.524 --> 32:47.691
Chamberlain.

32:47.725 --> 32:49.025
- Did you find Maddox?
- I did not, sire,

32:49.060 --> 32:51.495
but I found another
with urgent news

32:51.529 --> 32:53.897
about our punisher.

32:54.965 --> 32:56.933
The wife.

32:56.967 --> 33:00.837
Insisted she speak of this
pressing matter only with you.

33:17.452 --> 33:21.788
It was received from
Baron Pryce, but an hour ago.

33:21.823 --> 33:23.790
A rebel,
discovered in our shire,

33:23.825 --> 33:25.592
has confessed
to the murder

33:25.626 --> 33:29.162
of his beloved wife,
Lady Trula.

33:30.297 --> 33:32.132
The baron claims
that the guilty man

33:32.166 --> 33:34.134
was under orders of the Wolf.

33:34.168 --> 33:36.636
Yes.

33:36.670 --> 33:38.505
Not unlike
the order given

33:38.539 --> 33:41.707
to attack you
at the fishing village.

33:45.346 --> 33:46.979
As it is

33:47.014 --> 33:49.182
our jurisdiction, Baroness,

33:49.216 --> 33:51.251
I have promised Baron Pryce
swift justice

33:51.285 --> 33:55.655
in the trial and punishment
of this godless murderer.

33:58.125 --> 33:59.959
Yes.

34:01.662 --> 34:03.629
(door opens)

34:03.664 --> 34:06.298
Pardon, Baroness.

34:06.332 --> 34:07.166
Good chamberlain.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.333
We have visitors.

34:09.369 --> 34:12.337
His most Holy,
the Archdeacon of Windsor.

34:23.183 --> 34:25.818
I've told the gate guards
Jessamy and the children

34:25.851 --> 34:27.687
are meeting family
just beyond the north turn.

34:27.721 --> 34:30.156
I can tuck the trapper
in the back of the wagon.

34:30.190 --> 34:31.523
He can take the reins
when they clear,

34:31.558 --> 34:32.991
get them to the Wolf.

34:33.025 --> 34:34.326
Good.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.995
Blades, hammer and punch
for the shackles.

34:37.029 --> 34:40.199
Our cage key should unlock
Berber's quarters.

34:41.234 --> 34:43.068
And your play for
Leon and the others,

34:43.101 --> 34:44.203
you trust
it will work?

34:44.237 --> 34:46.705
The knights will be
into the mead by now,

34:46.739 --> 34:48.574
aware that Huxley
has not returned.

34:48.608 --> 34:51.141
If I can spur Leon
to a challenge

34:51.177 --> 34:53.178
before they press me
for answers,

34:53.213 --> 34:56.147
the reeve's pride should
distract their suspicion.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.982
I'll take the fight
to the training yard.

34:58.017 --> 34:59.484
Wait there with the others.

34:59.519 --> 35:01.687
We make the attack,
sudden and deadly.

35:01.721 --> 35:03.154
Yea.

35:03.189 --> 35:04.522
Father.

35:04.556 --> 35:06.190
You must go.

35:06.225 --> 35:07.491
They wait for you. Please.

35:07.526 --> 35:08.726
Easy now, lad. Who waits?

35:11.196 --> 35:13.197
The chamberlain would like
a word, punisher.

35:39.257 --> 35:42.392
Ah, Father Ruskin.

35:42.426 --> 35:44.761
This is his most Holy,
Archdeacon of Windsor.

35:45.963 --> 35:48.265
An honor to meet you,
your most Holiness.

35:48.299 --> 35:50.267
You as well, good priest.

35:51.569 --> 35:54.704
The Archdeacon is here for
an examination of accounts.

35:54.739 --> 35:56.373
Officially, yes.

35:56.407 --> 35:58.875
Our Holy Father, Pope Clement,

35:58.909 --> 36:01.210
requires a most
accurate reporting

36:01.245 --> 36:02.379
of his growing flock.

36:02.413 --> 36:04.080
For me,

36:04.114 --> 36:08.385
it is more of an possibility
to meet your congregation.

36:08.419 --> 36:10.052
LADY LOVE:
I do hope you'll honor us

36:10.087 --> 36:12.554
by giving Mass this Sunday,
Archdeacon.

36:12.589 --> 36:15.223
ROBINUS: The honor would
indeed be mine, Baroness.

36:15.258 --> 36:18.727
I beg your pardon,
Holiness.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.263
I have some duties
to close before I retire.

36:21.298 --> 36:22.598
Thank you,

36:22.632 --> 36:24.099
Chamberlain.

36:24.133 --> 36:25.267
Baroness.
Good priest.

36:25.302 --> 36:26.802
Sir Absolon.

36:28.638 --> 36:30.639
LADY LOVE:
Good night, Milus.

36:35.478 --> 36:38.314
We have prepared our guest
chamber for you, Archdeacon.

36:38.348 --> 36:41.149
That is most gracious.

36:41.184 --> 36:42.284
FATHER RUSKIN:
Sir Absolon,

36:42.319 --> 36:44.786
I've made room for you

36:44.821 --> 36:46.621
in my quarters.

36:46.655 --> 36:48.824
Thank you, Father.

36:56.799 --> 36:59.767
- Maddox and Marshal wait with my men.
- Good.

37:00.002 --> 37:01.302
Chamberlain, may I ask

37:01.337 --> 37:03.471
what pressing thing
the wife spoke of?

37:03.506 --> 37:06.974
If it be of a criminal nature,
I should be aware.

37:07.009 --> 37:10.478
It was more of
a marital nature.

37:10.513 --> 37:13.548
Station Sir Norton
outside the door.

37:16.018 --> 37:17.519
That is all, Reeve.

37:36.571 --> 37:38.872
Why are we here,
Corbett?

37:38.906 --> 37:41.741
Sir Huxley has yet to return
from his travels with you.

37:43.111 --> 37:45.579
And why is that
our concern?

37:45.613 --> 37:47.747
It is more the concern
of your wife.

37:48.749 --> 37:50.517
She told me that
some of the knights

37:50.552 --> 37:52.485
made vile and lustful

37:52.519 --> 37:54.654
advances towards her.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.190
And you,

37:57.224 --> 37:58.658
overcome with
jealous rage,

37:58.693 --> 38:00.727
threatened to
take vengeance.

38:00.761 --> 38:03.196
She begs that
I confine you

38:03.230 --> 38:06.566
until your proper mind
can be restored.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.571
It is time for us
to be true,

38:11.606 --> 38:13.573
gentlemen.

38:15.943 --> 38:19.112
I know who you
and your friends are.

38:20.948 --> 38:22.548
Hooded bandits

38:22.583 --> 38:26.218
caught up inside
a bloody dumbshow.

38:26.252 --> 38:29.755
What proof do you have
of this wild tale?

38:31.925 --> 38:36.595
I knew of Wilkin the
warrior long before

38:36.630 --> 38:39.665
he was Wilkin the
barley farmer.

38:40.967 --> 38:43.936
I was quite certain that he
was not Gawain the punisher.

38:43.970 --> 38:48.807
The rest of your clever
guile was obvious.

38:50.309 --> 38:52.544
You present the
dead bandits

38:52.578 --> 38:56.881
to quash a rally for
a noble hunting party.

38:56.915 --> 38:59.217
And you condemn
your own brother.

38:59.252 --> 39:02.220
A deserter and an annoyance.

39:02.255 --> 39:05.390
It was the wife, however,

39:05.424 --> 39:08.260
who inspired my rescue.

39:08.294 --> 39:09.761
A rescue that makes us
your puppets.

39:09.795 --> 39:11.763
Not puppets.

39:11.797 --> 39:14.432
Soldiers.

39:14.467 --> 39:17.969
My proposition...

39:19.639 --> 39:24.609
...you want revenge for what
happened in the village.

39:24.644 --> 39:26.811
I need smart and capable men

39:26.845 --> 39:32.783
who will serve me beyond
the boundaries of manor law.

39:32.817 --> 39:36.320
WILKIN: Your noble guard
bows to your whim.

39:38.490 --> 39:41.825
Most of my knights
are hirelings.

39:41.859 --> 39:45.329
Soldiers of fortune
with a loyalty to profit,

39:45.363 --> 39:47.864
not manor.

39:50.702 --> 39:53.870
The risk of betrayal
is too great.

39:55.573 --> 39:56.906
Sir Norton.

39:59.210 --> 40:01.544
Chamberlain.

40:06.049 --> 40:08.351
CORBETT:
You were there

40:08.385 --> 40:10.687
the night that we served
justice to West River Riding?

40:10.721 --> 40:13.022
Yes, sir.

40:13.056 --> 40:15.558
I saw you take
a torch to homes

40:15.593 --> 40:16.892
and put a blade

40:16.927 --> 40:19.762
in many innocent villagers.

40:19.796 --> 40:21.731
Is this a discussion to be had

40:21.765 --> 40:23.566
in the presence of these men,
Chamberlain?

40:23.601 --> 40:24.767
I am afraid it is.

40:30.273 --> 40:33.075
Gather your friends.

40:33.110 --> 40:35.911
Torture him, kill him,

40:35.946 --> 40:37.913
whatever will quench
the thirst of your vengeance.

40:37.948 --> 40:41.083
Then, when you are through,
toss him in the water pit.

40:41.118 --> 40:44.086
I will see to it
that his and Huxley's blood

40:44.121 --> 40:45.587
does not land on your hands.

40:45.622 --> 40:49.291
Five, gutting a helpless one,
would bring no man peace.

40:49.325 --> 40:51.727
Your peace is not my concern.

40:51.762 --> 40:54.763
This is about honor
and business.

40:54.797 --> 40:57.599
He is my offering.

40:57.634 --> 40:59.067
And it will be my final one.

40:59.101 --> 41:02.571
Your wrath will not touch
our reeve

41:02.605 --> 41:05.240
or any of his other men.

41:05.275 --> 41:10.412
Then... you and your bandits
will serve under my charge.

41:10.446 --> 41:12.614
There is much to accomplish.

41:16.619 --> 41:19.421
You are well aware
of the consequences

41:19.455 --> 41:22.658
if you turn against that
or disappear.

41:29.665 --> 41:32.333
Imagine...

41:32.367 --> 41:34.836
how heartbroken Love would be,

41:34.870 --> 41:37.638
if she were
to discover that her

41:37.673 --> 41:40.809
growing affection was born

41:40.843 --> 41:45.880
on a bed of lies
and godless deception.

41:52.321 --> 41:54.789
Oh.

41:54.824 --> 41:57.457
The wife.

41:57.491 --> 41:59.827
She is quite mad.

41:59.861 --> 42:02.329
Take concern in that.

42:17.738 --> 42:19.739
(moans quietly)

42:23.577 --> 42:27.413
Ask the question
that weighs on you heavy.

42:34.321 --> 42:37.122
Do you gather the others
or should I?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.495
I'll bring them.

42:52.405 --> 42:54.406
(Norton groans)

43:08.954 --> 43:11.122

(water dripping)

45:05.535 --> 45:10.038
It warms my heart
that you have come.

45:22.284 --> 45:26.087
A man has confessed
to the murder of Lady Trula.

45:26.121 --> 45:28.556
According to Baron Pryce,

45:28.590 --> 45:29.890
he claims to be a rebel,

45:29.925 --> 45:32.260
following the orders
of the Wolf.

45:39.801 --> 45:41.902
I do not know this man,

45:41.937 --> 45:43.438
sister.

45:43.472 --> 45:45.106
He was not under my orders

45:45.140 --> 45:46.474
or anyone else's
within the Byth Encil.

45:46.508 --> 45:47.775
Why would he lie

45:47.809 --> 45:51.045
and willingly condemn
himself to death?

45:51.080 --> 45:52.713
I cannot know what
is in his heart.

45:52.747 --> 45:57.551
It seems that now my lore
is being turned against me.

45:57.586 --> 46:01.722
If they only knew
how small I truly am.

46:01.756 --> 46:05.426
The famous Wolf, scurrying like
a rat through dank tunnels,

46:05.461 --> 46:07.260
stealing crumbs
from kind strangers.

46:07.295 --> 46:11.064
Please forgive me,
dearest Love,

46:11.099 --> 46:12.900
for pulling
you into this.

46:12.934 --> 46:16.136
I come to this cause
willingly.

46:18.139 --> 46:22.610
Do not fall down
that dark hole, brother.

46:22.644 --> 46:25.445
I need the big, strong Wolf

46:25.480 --> 46:28.448
to eat the sad, little rat.

46:28.483 --> 46:30.985
Spit and wit.

46:38.994 --> 46:41.361
This man will be
in our charge soon.

46:43.498 --> 46:45.632
I will find out
what is in his heart.

46:45.666 --> 46:47.934
Get the truth
in this matter.

47:10.157 --> 47:12.191
We need to help each other.

47:13.326 --> 47:16.162
It is extraordinary.

47:18.632 --> 47:21.433
Find a smith
who can separate all the stones.

47:21.468 --> 47:23.802
It should provide
a strong foundation

47:23.837 --> 47:25.838
to build your army.

47:30.677 --> 47:32.644
I have your word, brother,

47:32.679 --> 47:34.847
that we do this together?

47:34.881 --> 47:36.849
Yes.

47:36.883 --> 47:39.651
An alliance of noble and outlaw.

47:39.686 --> 47:43.522
It is... rather poetic.

47:43.556 --> 47:46.358
Poetry will not keep our necks
from the king's ax.

47:48.127 --> 47:52.798
With caution and counsel
is how we proceed.

47:55.001 --> 47:57.935
In the presence of God,

47:57.969 --> 47:59.804
you have my word.

48:06.011 --> 48:07.845
May our savior

48:07.880 --> 48:10.347
keep you safe, Gruffy.

48:10.382 --> 48:12.483
Of course he will.

48:12.518 --> 48:14.519
Jesus was a rebel.

49:16.368 --> 49:18.368
(man yelling)

49:21.039 --> 49:23.040
(muffled yelling)

49:25.043 --> 49:27.010
I will keep

49:27.045 --> 49:30.347
turning and turning.

49:30.381 --> 49:32.550
I need the name

49:32.584 --> 49:34.384
of the man
who killed the boy's mother.

49:34.419 --> 49:36.420
(muffled yelling)

49:38.590 --> 49:41.091
Toran!

49:41.125 --> 49:44.962
(muffled groaning)

49:46.097 --> 49:47.931
(yelling)

49:47.966 --> 49:49.599
- Toran!
- (yelling)

49:49.633 --> 49:52.569
(groaning)

49:52.603 --> 49:54.737
(sighs)

49:54.772 --> 49:57.574
(groaning)

49:57.608 --> 49:59.409
(groans)

49:59.444 --> 50:02.412
(sighs)

50:02.447 --> 50:04.414
God have mercy.

50:04.449 --> 50:05.415
What spurred
such horror?

50:05.450 --> 50:07.084
A need for truth.

50:07.118 --> 50:09.152
Do not stop me!

50:09.187 --> 50:10.620
ASH:
Brothers. Please.

50:10.654 --> 50:12.654
We are family,
are we not?

50:24.868 --> 50:26.869
Sir Denley.

50:29.039 --> 50:32.674
He was the one who plunged
the dagger through your mother.

50:33.676 --> 50:35.978
He gave up that truth.

50:36.013 --> 50:39.515
He was witness to it all.

50:42.551 --> 50:45.487
And Ventris.

50:47.823 --> 50:51.493
He was the one
who slit my boy's throat.

50:58.834 --> 51:01.702
I give us
what we want, brothers.

51:10.012 --> 51:12.347
This knight--

51:12.381 --> 51:14.649
he knows of the man
who killed my Eva.

51:14.683 --> 51:16.217
I need to take that from him.

51:16.252 --> 51:19.720
- Toran... - If we are to be crushed
under Corbett's thumb,

51:19.755 --> 51:23.691
at least give me the relief
of knowing who took her life.

51:23.725 --> 51:26.527
And you think it gives me relief

51:26.562 --> 51:30.565
every time I see Petra's cross
swing from our reeve's neck?

51:32.568 --> 51:35.036
- It tortures me.
- Yea.

51:35.070 --> 51:39.206
And it will drive you
to a madness only soothed

51:39.240 --> 51:43.377
by thrusting a blade
into the belly of the reeve.

51:43.411 --> 51:45.980
Allow <i>me</i>

51:46.014 --> 51:50.183
the comfort
the madness will serve!

51:54.055 --> 51:56.422
That deeper burn.

52:11.772 --> 52:13.773
(groans)

52:16.577 --> 52:18.712
(panting)

52:18.746 --> 52:22.081
(groaning)

52:22.116 --> 52:23.916
(yelling)

52:23.950 --> 52:25.618
(crunch)

52:27.954 --> 52:30.789
(sighs)

52:30.824 --> 52:34.093
Sir Locke.

52:34.128 --> 52:37.463
He thrust the blade
into her belly.

52:39.466 --> 52:42.635
And then her throat.

52:44.571 --> 52:46.739
It was Locke.

52:54.580 --> 52:56.581
(loud panting)

52:56.616 --> 52:58.617
(groaning)

53:08.327 --> 53:11.129
Please.

53:31.717 --> 53:33.718
(sighs)

53:52.303 --> 53:54.304
(yelling)

53:56.473 --> 53:58.942
- (grunts)
- (liquid pouring)

53:58.976 --> 54:00.977
- (airy gasping)
- (liquid pouring)

54:20.897 --> 54:23.366
And so, we have vengeance.

55:15.144 --> 55:17.145
(doors creak open)

56:21.176 --> 56:23.177
Master Gawain?

56:30.351 --> 56:32.352
Baroness.

56:34.021 --> 56:38.859
We always seem to find ourselves
in the most unlikely of places.

56:40.394 --> 56:42.762
Yes.

56:42.797 --> 56:45.264
Have you exchanged

56:45.299 --> 56:47.801
church pews for sacks of grain?

56:50.204 --> 56:52.205
(sighs)

56:59.547 --> 57:03.517
I fear God might not
recognize me as of late.

57:18.899 --> 57:21.033
Why is that?

57:27.407 --> 57:30.576
My heart feels
so unfamiliar.

57:32.412 --> 57:34.747
As if it beats
inside another man.

57:35.782 --> 57:39.384
And my hands-- they...

57:39.419 --> 57:41.854
hold no warmth, no...

57:44.357 --> 57:46.691
...truth I can recall.

57:53.899 --> 57:56.234
I'm sorry, my lady. I'm...

57:58.404 --> 58:00.572
I'm so very tired.

58:02.575 --> 58:04.543
(sighs)

58:04.577 --> 58:06.744
And very sad.

58:10.583 --> 58:12.584
(sighs)

58:18.257 --> 58:21.726
If this other man is half
as true and good

58:21.760 --> 58:24.261
as the one I know,

58:24.296 --> 58:27.765
I am sure God sees
the grace within him.

58:33.171 --> 58:36.140
You are so kind
to me, my lady.

58:38.143 --> 58:40.344
And so beautiful.

58:45.584 --> 58:48.385
My moments with you--
they feel like...

58:48.420 --> 58:50.922
the only thing
that has any truth.

58:59.464 --> 59:01.798
You see me.

59:06.638 --> 59:09.806
From that moment in the chapel,
when you touched my wound...

59:14.646 --> 59:18.315
...my dearest Love,
I have been drawn to you.

59:35.900 --> 59:37.668
My apologies, Baroness.

59:37.702 --> 59:38.835
(sniffles)

59:38.870 --> 59:40.871
I am...

59:42.573 --> 59:45.542
It's the drunkenness of fatigue.

59:45.576 --> 59:47.544
(sniffles)

59:47.578 --> 59:50.047
I am not offended,
Master Gawain.

59:52.216 --> 59:54.417
Then you are most forgiving.

59:56.220 --> 59:58.221
Good night, Baroness.

59:59.223 --> 01:00:01.257
I saw the birth of a boy.

01:00:02.894 --> 01:00:06.396
When I touched your
wound that night.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:08.431
A vision.

01:00:10.434 --> 01:00:12.768
It lasted but a moment,

01:00:12.803 --> 01:00:16.606
but it was... vivid and clear.

01:00:19.276 --> 01:00:22.645
I sensed you saw it, as well?

01:00:31.622 --> 01:00:34.924
No, my lady. I...

01:00:34.958 --> 01:00:38.127
felt only the pain of my wound.
