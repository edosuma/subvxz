00:01.752 --> 00:03.211
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:03.295 --> 00:05.463
Coop will not stop twittering.

00:05.631 --> 00:08.424
Dr. Cooper lodged a formal complaint
against you.

00:08.509 --> 00:12.804
-Against me? Really? For what?
-Insubordination and general bitchiness.

00:14.640 --> 00:18.142
-How are we on time?
-We're good. Just don't get fancy.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.978
-What do we got?
-Jackie, really. Go.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.192
I tried to kill myself.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.070
I OD'd on some drugs
trying to get a girl's attention.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.196
Man.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.448
I'm executive of my mother's estate

00:32.533 --> 00:37.662
and, as such, it would mean the world
if I could set up a college fund for the girls,

00:37.746 --> 00:39.080
if for no other reason than taxes.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.832
Your mom and I
went to high school together.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.543
-Yes, we did. A million years ago.
-Half a million.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.169
She was the homecoming queen.

00:45.254 --> 00:49.048
She said that her mom was
Dad's girlfriend before you.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.342
Please.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.594
There's been a problem with shrinkage.

00:53.679 --> 00:56.389
And, frankly, any shrinkage
makes us all look bad,

00:56.473 --> 01:01.602
-even if it's just Imodium.
-And it's never just the Imodium, people.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.355
What is hospital policy
regarding lost or found drugs?

01:04.440 --> 01:06.149
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.608
Why so desperate?

01:07.693 --> 01:09.402
Do you want to get your ass kicked?

02:22.726 --> 02:25.937
-I don't think these are done.
-She's making our cupcakes flat.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.774
-Stop doing that, Fi.
-Maybe I should try one.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.067
No way.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.696
-Hello.
-Hello.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.786
No, wait. Stop.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.705
You cannot put some vanilla in.
I'm putting the vanilla in.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.835
Kaitlyn?

02:48.919 --> 02:52.255
-So?
-I'm less than thrilled.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.257
Well, I thought we agreed
that it was good for Grace

02:54.341 --> 02:55.716
to have play dates with her friends.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.845
And right now, she only has one. So...

03:02.975 --> 03:04.725
That looks like fun.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.770
Grace's tuition is killing us.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.148
Well, about that,

03:11.233 --> 03:13.734
O'Hara's mom died
and left her some money,

03:13.819 --> 03:17.154
and she wanted me to ask you
about setting something up for the girls.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.364
No.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.075
I mean, I know she's your friend, but no.

03:21.243 --> 03:22.743
You don't think
we should at least think about it?

03:22.828 --> 03:25.663
-Money always comes with strings, Jackie.
-Not always.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.166
Took money from my mom and your mom.
Both times, we regretted it.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.918
Yes, that is true.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.797
Can we at least
mull it over for a little while?

03:34.882 --> 03:37.508
You want me to mull over
taking money from a crazy person?

03:37.593 --> 03:39.510
-She's not crazy.
-She lives in a hotel.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.722
-Because she's rich.
-Most rich people live in houses

03:42.806 --> 03:45.850
or high-rises or villas, not hotels.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.768
That doesn't make her crazy.

03:50.105 --> 03:53.190
By the way,
that little Kaitlyn in there is a big, fat snot.

03:53.275 --> 03:56.027
-That's all I'm saying.
-I'm keeping an eye on it.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.324
-You're a good dad.
-I know.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.879
Jesus! Kaitlyn, you scared me.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.590
Grace said there was a bomb shelter
down here.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.175
I wanted to see if she was making it up.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.469
Kaitlyn, honey,
Grace does not make things up.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.221
Grace worries a lot about things
that don't even make sense.

04:24.306 --> 04:28.726
-You should probably get her some help.
-Is that right? Are you a shrink?

04:33.190 --> 04:35.316
What was that thing you just did
with the straw?

04:38.153 --> 04:40.655
Kaitlyn, you were
not supposed to have seen that.

04:40.739 --> 04:45.910
It was a trick that nurses use
to dry up their tear ducts.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.038
Why do you need to dry up
your tear ducts?

04:49.122 --> 04:52.083
Because we see a lot of pain and suffering
during the day,

04:52.167 --> 04:55.836
and the last thing we want to do is
come home and cry in front of our families.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.009
I need a hug.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.013
Can I have one?

05:21.029 --> 05:25.324
I made too much Tater Tot hot dish
so I thought I'd bring some over.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.119
Kaitlyn says you guys order a lot of pizza.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.496
Yes. We happen to love pizza.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.960
-Doing the bills, huh?
-Every month.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.713
I wish my husband did the bills.

05:41.174 --> 05:45.302
The girls are in the kitchen. In the kitchen.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.268
Don't those look yummy?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.688
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.
Well, thank you for coming over.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.358
-These are for you.
-Thank you.

05:59.443 --> 06:02.319
-I can't wait to taste them.
-Grace doesn't want any,

06:02.404 --> 06:05.322
-so can I have hers?
-You don't want any, Grace?

06:05.407 --> 06:07.742
Kaitlyn and Fi touched them
with their bare hands

06:07.826 --> 06:09.618
and filled them full of their bacteria.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.830
I washed my hands, Grace,
right in front of you, like you told me to.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.292
-She made me wash my hands.
-Well, washing your hands is sanitary.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.335
Thank you for setting
such a good example, honey.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.922
But washing your hands every two minutes
is kind of crazy, if you ask me.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.758
That's a lot.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.136
Not if you don't want to get swine flu
and probably die from it.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.265
You know, I am a nurse,
and she has a good point.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.392
You can never wash your hands too much.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.857
Well, we should probably be going.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.193
Thank you so much for having Kaitlyn over.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.861
Sure, you bet.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.655
We'll just say goodbye to Kev. Bye-bye.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.335
We are so not eating that.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.463
If anybody asks,
Fiona's allergic to potatoes.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.633
-No, I'm not.
-So you want me to lie?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.552
Honey, there are good lies
and there are bad lies.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.181
It's a little complicated.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.572
So what are you shopping here for?

07:28.657 --> 07:32.118
This stuff costs, like, 10 times more
than at a real grocery store.

07:32.661 --> 07:36.413
Okay, buddy, I'll be honest with you.
I was worried about you.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.333
You took an overdose
and had to have your stomach pumped.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.212
Did you do it 'cause, you know, this place?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.257
No, I didn't do it because of this place.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.218
Whatever you say, bro.
I'm just here to support, not judge.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.971
Hey, prepare for a mind explosion.

07:56.852 --> 08:00.771
I'm on the list of the top 25 docs
in all Manhattan.

08:00.856 --> 08:04.567
-I don't know what to say about that.
-Yeah, I know. Right?

08:07.028 --> 08:10.531
I bought all this crap so I won't, you know,
get you into any trouble with your boss.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.074
I am my boss.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.578
Yeah? They pay you decent?

08:15.912 --> 08:18.122
-That's personal, Coop.
-Come on, seriously?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.207
With me, there's no such thing
as too personal.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.168
I already knew that about you, Coop.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.922
We kind of have a shorthand, right?
Don't you think? A little bit? You and me.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.761
-Sending somebody a text?
-Nope. Tweeting.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.725
-Just letting people know where I am.
-What people?

08:37.809 --> 08:40.853
My followers. I have 240.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.564
You should try it. A guy like you
would probably have 100 at least.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.357
Yeah. No, thanks.

08:47.402 --> 08:50.112
So just so you know, if you need anything,
or just want to talk,

08:50.197 --> 08:53.574
you're on my way to work.
I can drop in any time you want.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.368
So anyway, who told you? Was it Jackie?

08:56.620 --> 08:58.704
It's all over the hospital
that you tried to kill yourself.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.914
Shit.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.418
No worries, man. I sent out a tweet
saying you were totally alive.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.086
Please don't do that.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.796
You're right.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.841
It's probably still pretty much
an open wound for you.

09:10.926 --> 09:15.471
-But Jackie told you, right?
-No, I think it was Thor, the diabetic.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.432
So did she say anything, Jackie?

09:19.351 --> 09:22.811
Truth be told,
we're not exactly talking at the moment.

09:23.230 --> 09:28.484
In fact, I had to file a complaint against her
with Akalitus, for insubordination.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.320
I will crush her!

09:36.618 --> 09:38.118
Well, I should get to work.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.415
-You sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.459
Listen, sometimes I get migraines.

09:45.794 --> 09:51.257
I mixed some meds, I drank a few beers.
It was a mistake, no big deal.

09:51.341 --> 09:56.095
I'm good. In fact, I'm great.
Tell everybody, or not.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.016
-Whatever you say, bro.
-All right, man.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.394
Yeah.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.942
So anyway, she left the house, I just
chucked the whole thing in the garbage.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.238
I know that if she had her way,
she would be Mrs. Ginny Peyton,

10:14.322 --> 10:15.990
I would be going home to some other dude.

10:16.616 --> 10:21.620
If you want to avoid people from your past,
I recommend moving to another country.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.747
Worked for me.

10:23.832 --> 10:27.459
Another thing, I don't want Kaitlyn's
snottiness to rub off on Grace.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.296
Snot is viral, snottiness is not.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.759
So anyway, I talked to Kevin

10:35.844 --> 10:40.931
about your idea of a gift for the girls and I...
It just makes him uncomfortable.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.101
Do you know what would make him
really uncomfortable?

10:44.185 --> 10:46.437
A daughter who's a lap dancer.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.482
Take the money. Get them an education.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.570
Okay.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.034
"Twenty-five best doctors in Manhattan"?

11:03.455 --> 11:07.458
"Number 23.
All Saints Hospital, Dr. Fitch Cooper"?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.335
How did this happen?

11:09.836 --> 11:12.254
So... It's a bloody outrage.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.215
Where the fuck am I?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.925
-What do we got?
-Dog bite.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.179
Severe facial laceration. Lost a lot of blood.
Heart rate's through the roof.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.765
-This guy wasn't bitten. He was mauled.
-Great Dane bit him in the face

11:22.849 --> 11:25.893
-after he tried to resuscitate it.
-He tried to resuscitate a Great Dane?

11:26.269 --> 11:28.145
The Garden. North Hampton dog show.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.813
Dog had a heart attack
during Best of Breed.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.690
Danes are inbred and have oversized hearts.

11:31.775 --> 11:35.778
-The guy's wife is out there freaking.
-On my count. One, two, three.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.157
-What'd he say?
-I have no idea. IV morphine.

11:40.241 --> 11:44.244
-And page maxillofacial.
-That's because he can't just say "plastics."

11:44.329 --> 11:45.579
My nuts.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.540
-Did he just say "my nuts"?
-Let's have a look.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.598
-Man.
-What?

12:04.974 --> 12:07.976
Well, his scrotum is intact,
but it's just hanging there.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.520
-It's apparently empty.
-Empty?

12:09.604 --> 12:10.938
Yes, empty.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.194
Holy shit. His testicles have migrated...

12:17.278 --> 12:20.739
Migrated. Like birds.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.368
-...into his pelvic wall.
-They can do that?

12:24.452 --> 12:26.703
It's very rare.
I've never actually seen it before,

12:26.788 --> 12:30.457
but it's an automatic anatomic response
to attack by predator.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.210
You know, back in the olden days?

12:33.294 --> 12:36.296
Primitive man versus saber-toothed tiger.
It's not that big of a deal.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.799
It's just really painful.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.928
-Better page urology, too.
-No. Hey, that's my call. I get to say that.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.390
Page urology.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.190
-Mrs. Fogulson?
-How's my husband?

12:55.275 --> 12:58.652
-Well, the facial wounds are pretty severe.
-Oh, my God.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.864
But we have the best plastic surgeons
in the city, so he's in very good hands.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.657
I feel horrible.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.368
We'll probably be banned
from the kennel club.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.414
-But he did save Bartholomew's life.
-Is that right?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.416
-Do you have dogs?
-No.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.918
-Why not?
-Kids. Lots of kids.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.629
-Kids love dogs.
-My boys are allergic.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.007
-Zyrtec.
-We don't take pills in our family.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.218
By the way,
your husband's testicles have migrated.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.511
Migrated?

13:24.596 --> 13:27.347
We'll let you know as soon as we find them.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.854
God, these gloves are so tight,
I feel like O.J.

13:33.938 --> 13:37.900
-That's the third time you've said that today.
-Like your material's fresh.

13:39.194 --> 13:43.197
-Are you wearing eye shadow?
-No. Maybe. Why?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.869
-You look nice.
-Back off.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.253
Dr. Cooper,
this just came to my office by mistake.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.839
Apparently, it's from your mothers.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.521
How on earth did that happen?

14:16.064 --> 14:19.399
Just getting a little recognition
for all my good work, I guess.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.568
You paid a publicist, didn't you?

14:24.280 --> 14:26.365
I have a publicist, yes,

14:26.449 --> 14:31.370
but that is not why I was chosen for the list
of the best 25 doctors in Manhattan.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.248
But you do pay a publicist, am I right?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.709
-No.
-Wow.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.836
-You paid a publicist.
-You can stop saying that now.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.506
Congratulations, Dr. Cooper.

14:45.927 --> 14:50.097
Yes, congratulations would seem to be
in order, so congratulations.

14:50.431 --> 14:54.142
Twenty-three out of 25 people.
Twenty-three.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.396
Out of a lot.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.690
Hey, would you mind putting this
in my office for me?

14:59.774 --> 15:01.441
Just be careful with it.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.735
Do I look like a pack mule to you,
Dr. Cooper?

15:04.946 --> 15:05.988
No.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.623
You do know he just made a list
of the 25 best doctors in Manhattan, right?

15:16.708 --> 15:17.958
Yes, I heard.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.252
-He paid a publicist.
-He did?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.879
Yes, of course he did.
How do you know that?

15:22.964 --> 15:24.131
He told me.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.350
Shit. Shit!

15:36.394 --> 15:37.561
What have you done?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.896
I messed up my hand
on that gurney transfer.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.773
Middle finger. Shit.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.026
Dislocated?

15:44.110 --> 15:46.695
It's better than fucking up my back, I guess.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.823
-Want me to have a look?
-Thanks.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.452
It's too bad. I had a long list of people
I was gonna flip off.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.578
I guess I'll have to wait.

15:54.662 --> 15:58.123
Yes, well, we'll have you
expressing your hostility in no time.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.543
What is this American obsession with lists?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.755
Top 10 this, top 20 that.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.258
-Nice manicure, by the way.
-Okay.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.927
Thanks. My sister has a salon on Sullivan.

16:11.012 --> 16:14.514
See? That's what I'm talking about.
Word of mouth, not some poxy list.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.644
-That really hurts.
-Yeah, because it's really out of joint.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.229
As if being on a list
could make you a better doctor.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.734
I'm gonna puke.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.446
-Yes, well, you better not.
-I think I need to lie down.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.323
Want me to wrap that for you?

16:47.382 --> 16:49.508
Hey. You just punched in my number.

16:49.592 --> 16:54.137
-No, I most certainly did not.
-Yes, you did. 11-19-86. That's my birthday.

16:54.722 --> 16:58.308
11-19-66 is what I punched in.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.854
-That's not my PIN number.
-No, it most certainly is not.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.316
I can't believe your PIN number is
almost exactly the same as mine.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.610
Yes, it's called coincidence.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.738
Can I help you with something?

17:11.823 --> 17:14.199
We just got this guy
whose cell phone exploded in his face,

17:14.283 --> 17:16.076
second-degree burns.

17:16.577 --> 17:20.414
Got to get him some morphine
from the gumball machine.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.374
"The gumball machine."

17:22.458 --> 17:25.585
Yeah, I just made that up on the spot.
It's pretty cool, huh?

17:27.797 --> 17:31.508
-Are you wearing perfume?
-No. Why?

17:31.843 --> 17:35.053
Is it bad?
Does it make me smell like an old lady?

17:36.347 --> 17:40.183
No, but I am pretty sure
Mrs. Akalitus is wearing the same thing.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.533
-I need you for half the next shift.
-Me specifically?

17:56.617 --> 17:59.202
I need someone to cover triage
for half the shift.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.620
All right.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.252
-What is it that you're doing?
-Tweeting.

18:07.336 --> 18:11.840
-Why do you feel the need to do this?
-Because he doesn't have any real friends.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.968
As a matter of fact, I do. His name is Eddie,
and I just saw him this morning.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.595
-How's he doing?
-Great!

18:16.679 --> 18:18.805
He works over at Excelsior Drugs
right around the corner,

18:18.890 --> 18:21.558
but if you followed me on Twitter,
you would've known that three hours ago.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.477
Fascinating.

18:23.561 --> 18:26.062
You're being sarcastic, I can tell, but it is.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.900
Jump on the social networking train.
You won't regret it.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.860
Could you find out, let's say,

18:31.944 --> 18:34.654
what Bellevue's lowest bid
on medical waste removal is?

18:34.822 --> 18:35.822
It doesn't work like that.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.325
How about the fat content of a lemon bar?
Could it tell me that?

18:38.826 --> 18:40.660
-No.
-Then what good is it?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.121
Can I help you?

18:44.248 --> 18:46.625
Are you wearing L.A.M.B. by Gwen Stefani?

18:49.504 --> 18:51.463
Yeah, I didn't think so.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.350
If you're gonna drink,
you're gonna do it outside.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.187
No problemo.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.157
-Kev?
-Hey, babe.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.369
Listen, I'm gonna need you to be
at the house when the girls get there, okay?

19:22.453 --> 19:24.287
-I got to cover half the next shift.
-No, no, I can't.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.957
I'm heading to Jamaica Bay
to pick up the new barstools.

19:27.041 --> 19:30.794
You're kidding me. All right.
Who are we gonna get to be there?

19:30.878 --> 19:33.713
Well, I could call Ginny.
She said she's always available.

19:34.465 --> 19:37.133
Yes, I have no doubt, and absolutely not.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.844
Why not?
She's right here in the neighborhood.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.555
Because I don't want that woman alone
in our house, that's why not.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.224
She wouldn't be alone.
She'd be with the girls.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.186
You know, if you had called me earlier,
we might have more options.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.230
Do not call Ginny Flynn.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.733
-Who's watching the bar?
-I'm gonna lock it up for a couple of hours.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.987
You couldn't have had the stools delivered,
for Christ's sake?

19:58.197 --> 20:01.992
Are you giving me a hard time
because for once I'm the one stuck at work?

20:02.076 --> 20:04.035
Do not call Ginny Flynn.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.414
If I don't get this guy upstairs
and get into these facial wounds,

20:07.498 --> 20:09.583
he's gonna suffer more tissue damage
than he already has.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.127
And I just need 10 minutes in the OR
to pull his testicles back down.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.254
-That can wait, Foner.
-Fuck you, Lindsey.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.922
Do you have any idea
what kind of pain this guy's in?

20:16.007 --> 20:18.300
You're saying, what,
his severely mauled face isn't painful?

20:18.384 --> 20:19.801
Apparently, that's a matter of opinion.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.094
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.972
Not good. They've been going at it
for almost 10 minutes.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.018
-You do boob jobs.
-Augmentation and reconstruction.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.228
Reconstructing flat-chested strippers.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.023
This is not in the least bit cosmetic, pally.

20:33.107 --> 20:36.401
-Hey, guys?
-Come on, it's the holy grail of urology.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.694
You're pathetic.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.948
-What's that, honey?
-Do my balls.

20:42.950 --> 20:46.953
-Okay. That was, "Do my balls."
-Told you.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.249
We got a guy in three
with second-degree burns

20:51.667 --> 20:53.376
in the shape of his cell phone.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.173
Can you take him up to surgery?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.967
Don't worry, honey.
We'll put everything back where it belongs.

21:04.805 --> 21:05.972
Cell phone burn. Did you get...

21:06.057 --> 21:07.933
-Fourth floor.
-Thanks.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.685
Zoey.

21:16.984 --> 21:17.984
Who is he?

21:18.569 --> 21:22.197
Not an actual person, just a location.
Party on Staten Island.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.283
-But there will be people there?
-Yes.

21:25.993 --> 21:31.081
And there will be one particular person.
So...

21:34.627 --> 21:36.586
-Hair down.
-Good call.

21:51.686 --> 21:56.314
I think you should refrain from discussing
personal information about co-workers.

21:56.399 --> 22:00.151
-What are you talking about?
-About Coop having a publicist.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.196
-Are you serious?
-I am. Very serious.

22:03.781 --> 22:07.951
-I thought you didn't even like that guy.
-That is beside the point.

22:09.161 --> 22:13.415
Wow. You are gonna bust my balls
every chance you get, aren't you?

22:28.139 --> 22:31.683
No, no, no, no. You were just drinking.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.519
No. Miss,
do you understand what I'm saying?

22:34.645 --> 22:35.812
No.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.690
-No.
-That's bullshit.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.068
Here. Pay attention.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.363
Formula.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.633
My God. I don't think I've ever seen you eat.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.511
I like to hide my humanity, Dr. O'Hara.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.431
Or at least keep it to a minimum.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.772
Is there room for two on that savior?

23:34.997 --> 23:39.084
I don't want his career, or the attention,
or the magazine articles.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.463
-Is this Dr. Cooper?
-I come to work, I keep my head down,

23:43.547 --> 23:45.256
I do my best,
which is pretty damn impressive.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.342
And some knob with a square jaw
and a publicist

23:47.426 --> 23:50.804
-starts prancing around like a...
-It's demoralizing.

23:51.722 --> 23:52.889
It is.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.725
And you wonder,

23:56.811 --> 24:00.396
"What is my incentive
to keep bringing my best?"

24:00.481 --> 24:03.149
I've been at All Saints since 1978.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.778
Oh, my God! That's 30...

24:08.739 --> 24:10.490
Stop doing the math.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.745
Do you really care
what a group of magazine editors

24:15.830 --> 24:20.083
that dole out stars
for the best street burrito and eyeliner

24:20.167 --> 24:22.210
think about healthcare providers?

24:23.003 --> 24:24.212
No.

24:33.639 --> 24:37.267
If I want anything, it's to know
that you know I'm a better physician.

24:40.646 --> 24:44.190
Does it help to know
that you're in my all-time top five?

24:48.737 --> 24:50.947
Wait. Who are the other four?

25:05.713 --> 25:08.673
-No, that's licorice.
-He's the licorice?

25:09.133 --> 25:12.552
Yeah. He's Lord Licorice. I see.
Hey, honey.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.725
Hey. Eddie. I'm a friend of Kevin's.
