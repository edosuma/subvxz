You don't wanna know, mate.
Why?
Well, you know between your bum
and your genitals, that area?

00:47.806 --> 00:49.528
It's one of my favourite areas.

Yeah, well, imagine someone

Shit, I can't be the birth partner!

01:16.330 --> 01:19.094
'Hold on. I see where this is going.
I ain't no birth partner!'

01:19.095 --> 01:22.299
Dude, you are gonna be
a great birth partner!

01:22.300 --> 01:26.305
The truth is, and I really wish
it wasn't true, but I'm a...

01:26.746 --> 01:29.390
paedophobe, to be honest.

01:29.391 --> 01:32.354
Oh, right... 'Oh, my life!'

01:32.355 --> 01:34.758
I mean, I... I suppose
I always wondered whether...

01:34.759 --> 01:38.764
I've always felt really weird
around children, you know?

01:39.166 --> 01:41.128
Right. Yeah.

01:41.129 --> 01:43.572

or punch his lights out?'

I don't know.
I mean, what sort of help can you get

01:47.939 --> 01:51.103
for an irrational fear of children?

01:51.104 --> 01:53.427
PaedoPHOBE!Oh, right.

01:53.428 --> 01:55.270
What did you think I meant?

01:55.271 --> 01:57.593
Oh, my God, Jeremy!

01:57.594 --> 01:59.516
It's just paedo, phobe...

I mean, they're both bad.

You thought I was saying
I was a mega-paedo?

you'd always wondered?

I'm just going back in.
I was only looking at the crisps

02:14.340 --> 02:17.745

three minutes max, honestly.

We'll see Sophie shortly
and if things haven't progressed,

02:24.636 --> 02:27.159
we can always give her
a cervical sweep, OK?

02:27.160 --> 02:29.843
Hmm. The cervical sweep.

The one who was... 'Nice'. ..here.
Yana's finished her shift.
Ah, oh, OK.

05:26.678 --> 05:30.684
Well, we, er, discussed the
possibility earlier of using a pool.

05:33.769 --> 05:35.852
Well, I don't have a note of that.

05:35.853 --> 05:37.414
'Great. Yana's a flake.

'The lovely nurse who doesn't write
anything down.

'She probably only works here
to get 'ludes.'

05:42.623 --> 05:44.986
And both birthing pools
are either occupied or...

05:44.987 --> 05:46.548
Look, I need a pool, OK?

05:46.549 --> 05:49.954
We want a natural birth. God knows
some people aren't convinced

06:27.413 --> 06:31.418

said, "Listen, you do things our way.

I don't care!

06:44.359 --> 06:46.041
I don't care!

06:46.042 --> 06:48.524
Oh! I want it to stop.
It's all too much!

06:48.525 --> 06:52.531
Soph, it's OK, we'll get you

I need pain relief, Mark!

06:55.456 --> 06:57.258
Oh, you don't want the pool?

06:57.259 --> 07:00.503
No, I want an epidural

07:00.504 --> 07:02.666

07:02.667 --> 07:05.551

for the pool.

07:05.552 --> 07:06.753

07:06.754 --> 07:07.955
If I go back now, I'll look...
You'll look what?

07:07.956 --> 07:10.438
It's just it'll weaken
my negotiating position.

07:10.439 --> 07:11.520
Mmm.

07:11.521 --> 07:14.405
No, Soph, yep, I'm on it.

07:14.406 --> 07:16.328
Just a tiny query...

07:16.329 --> 07:18.972
Can you remember,
not at your last place,

07:18.973 --> 07:21.576
but the place before,
the name of that nice plumber?

07:21.577 --> 07:24.941
Was it Tom or Tim?

07:24.942 --> 07:27.465
No biggy, but if it
jumps into your head,

07:27.466 --> 07:30.670
can you just pop the number
down there, would you?

07:38.763 --> 07:40.685
Hi, Ben.

07:40.686 --> 07:44.691
I thought this might inspire him,
you know, to write a novel,
now he's unconscious.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.336
Mm-hm, right.

07:47.337 --> 07:50.941
You know, it's funny, just looking
at him, I could tell we'd get on.

07:50.942 --> 07:54.066
He looks like a laugh,
a right laugh.

07:54.067 --> 07:56.950
I sort of want to shake his hand.
Would that be all right?

07:56.952 --> 07:58.273
Oh, go ahead.

07:58.274 --> 08:02.279
Ah, Ben, sleepy Ben.

I think I love your girlfriend.'

08:05.405 --> 08:07.086
'I want to steal your girlfriend,
I think I love your girlfriend.'
Sleepy Ben.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.368
That's nice.

08:08.369 --> 08:11.333
'I definitely don't hope
he dies, definitely not.

08:11.334 --> 08:12.935
'That would be horrible,

08:12.936 --> 08:16.901
'but he does look like he could do
with a nice long relaxing coma.'

08:16.902 --> 08:18.744
Oh, it's you again.

08:18.745 --> 08:20.347
Yes.

08:20.348 --> 08:21.749
OK, after a lot of hassle,

08:21.750 --> 08:23.872
I've actually managed
to swap things around,

08:23.873 --> 08:27.438
and it looks like the birthing
pool will be available, so...

08:27.439 --> 08:31.164
Yes, well as it happens,
things have changed and my partner

08:31.165 --> 08:32.885
no longer requires the pool.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.731
No, we want the what's it called,

08:35.732 --> 08:39.736
the drugs pipe, the heroin pump,
the crack tube, whatever you've got.

08:40.739 --> 08:41.980
I want to stop her suffering.

08:41.981 --> 08:43.462
I want to stop her suffering.
Wish I'd known this earlier.

'Hmm, you might be ripe
for a trim, in the cuts.'

08:46.749 --> 08:50.754
So before the accident, how long
had you two been...hanging out?

08:51.075 --> 08:52.517
Three months.

08:52.518 --> 08:54.119
OK. And how was it going?

08:54.120 --> 08:55.882
Were you two very...

08:55.883 --> 08:59.888
Oh, he's very committed to his work
and he did the Iron Man
triathlon...twice.

09:00.570 --> 09:02.372
Wow. So out of those three months,

09:02.373 --> 09:05.096
you can knock off at least
two weeks for training.

09:05.097 --> 09:08.662
He loves his dance music
and drugs and video games.

09:08.663 --> 09:10.224
God, really?

09:10.225 --> 09:12.247
- Whereas I love to read...
- Oh, me too.

09:12.248 --> 09:15.152
I love to read...  I adore
to read. It's amazing, isn't it?

09:15.273 --> 09:20.280
Because a book, I always say,
can be about anything.

09:20.721 --> 09:23.725
That's so true.
Yeah, I often read to Ben,

09:23.726 --> 09:26.449
but he's more of a magazine...
FHM...kind of guy.

09:26.450 --> 09:28.052
Right, yeah.

09:28.053 --> 09:29.334
PHONE RINGS

09:29.335 --> 09:31.177
Oh, shit, I'd better get this.

09:31.178 --> 09:32.459
Would you like to...

09:32.460 --> 09:36.024
Oh, sure.

09:36.025 --> 09:38.388
"This month's hot tip..."

09:38.389 --> 09:39.429
Hello?

09:39.430 --> 09:41.833
"The premier Wrangler collection.

09:41.834 --> 09:43.836
"When has good denim
ever been cheap?

09:43.837 --> 09:46.400
"The answer is never."

09:46.401 --> 09:49.004
Look, dude, bit of a weird one,

09:49.005 --> 09:52.490
but if you aren't
gonna make it through,

09:52.491 --> 09:56.416
I mean if you can't, then don't
worry, because Zara's great,

09:56.417 --> 10:00.422
and I'll be waiting, if you
check out, in a friendly way...

10:00.984 --> 10:02.625
not like a vulture...

10:02.626 --> 10:04.789
to check in.

10:04.790 --> 10:08.755
And don't worry, I'm not gonna
start waggling on any of your tubes,

10:08.756 --> 10:11.960
and if you have a problem with
anything I've just said then,

10:11.961 --> 10:13.923
do give me a sign.

10:13.924 --> 10:17.929
No? OK.

10:17.970 --> 10:21.975
"I'm in a swimming pool and my
bikini pops off. I'm not bothered,

10:22.097 --> 10:25.180
"I'll just carry on",
and that's a comment from Kayleigh.

10:25.181 --> 10:28.826
You can see a picture of Kayleigh
there, and her nice bum.

10:28.827 --> 10:30.148
Jez?

10:30.149 --> 10:31.791
Oh, hi, Mark.What are you doing?

10:31.792 --> 10:34.314
I'm reading FHM
to this unconscious guy.

10:34.316 --> 10:35.276
But why?

10:35.277 --> 10:37.159
But why?
Because I have a heart.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.564
Yeah?

10:40.565 --> 10:41.966
Work's crazy. Thanks so much.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.449
Oh, OK.

10:43.450 --> 10:44.931
What?

10:44.932 --> 10:45.772
Nothing.

10:45.773 --> 10:46.373
Nothing.
What?

10:46.374 --> 10:46.854
Nothing.
What?
Nothing.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.136
Nothing.
What?
Nothing.
No, go on, what?

10:48.137 --> 10:49.097
No, it's fine.

10:49.098 --> 10:50.660
No, it's fine.
What are you saying?Nothing.

10:50.661 --> 10:52.863
Look, there's no need to be
all cynical, just because...

10:52.864 --> 10:53.905
Look, there's no need to be
all cynical, just because...
Jeremy, it's fine.

10:53.906 --> 10:56.910
I'm actually quite glad
it's all a filthy duplicitous ploy.

10:56.911 --> 10:59.073
I was worried you had
a personality change.

10:59.074 --> 11:01.837
Oh, just because I'm doing
something decent,

11:01.838 --> 11:04.361
there has to be
some weird thing going on?

11:04.362 --> 11:07.205
Yes... Normally, yes.

11:07.206 --> 11:09.810
Thanks, Jez.

11:09.811 --> 11:12.814
I should be getting back to Sophie.

11:12.815 --> 11:16.540
Jez, would you consider
coming with me?

11:16.541 --> 11:18.463
I don't think I'm coping
all that well.

11:18.464 --> 11:19.665
Yeah, cool, man.

11:19.666 --> 11:20.386
You don't mind?

11:20.387 --> 11:22.509
You don't mind?
No. Kind of always
wanted to see a birth.

11:22.510 --> 11:26.515
Be kind of like Alien but sexy.
Sexy Alien.

11:29.461 --> 11:31.824
Hey, Soph, it's me, and Jez!

11:31.825 --> 11:34.828
When's the anaesthetist
coming, Mark? I need something.

11:34.829 --> 11:38.274
OK, look, I went crazy at them,
I totally lost it, actually,

11:38.275 --> 11:42.280
but the thing is that the
anaesthetist has this C-section now,

11:42.361 --> 11:44.243
and then there's another procedure

11:44.244 --> 11:45.926
that he's booked in to...
What?

11:45.927 --> 11:48.169
Tell them to pull
their fingers out, Mark.

11:48.170 --> 11:50.853
Look, the anaesthetist
can't be in two places at once!

11:50.854 --> 11:52.696
I mean, I wish he could,
but he can't.

11:52.697 --> 11:55.060
'How didIbecome
the hospital spin doctor?'

11:55.061 --> 11:56.983
I want an epidural!

11:56.984 --> 12:00.548
Hello! Hello, Sophie, how we doing?

12:00.549 --> 12:02.071
Hi, boys.

12:02.072 --> 12:04.434
OK, darling, baby's doing fine.

12:04.435 --> 12:08.440
I just wanna see how you're doing,
see how dilated you are, OK?

12:09.804 --> 12:13.809
'Hmm, stuck on the medical channel
and there's no remote control.'

12:20.140 --> 12:23.303
Maybe some...music?

12:23.304 --> 12:26.228
Yes. Yeah, maybe some music.

12:26.229 --> 12:27.230
Uh-huh.

12:27.231 --> 12:28.271
Uh-huh.
PANPIPE MUSIC

12:28.272 --> 12:31.917
'What a bastard. That's gonna
drive us all totally bonkers.'

12:31.918 --> 12:35.002
Yeah, you're doing great,
you're fully dilated.

12:35.003 --> 12:36.564
Your baby's coming.

12:36.565 --> 12:40.570
There's no time for an epidural.

12:41.413 --> 12:42.974
She put her whole hand in.

12:42.975 --> 12:43.855
Blimey.

12:43.856 --> 12:46.379
Blimey.
I didn't think she'd
put her whole hand in!

12:46.380 --> 12:48.663
No, God.

12:48.664 --> 12:50.706
Look, maybe I should go.

12:50.707 --> 12:53.751
'Of course. Brings
the insufferable music, then goes.

12:53.752 --> 12:55.594
'He's like the 1980s.'

12:55.595 --> 12:58.799
Hello? Hans?!

12:58.800 --> 13:01.603
Oh, OK, I'll be right down.

13:01.604 --> 13:05.609
That was Super Hans. He's here,
he wants money to fix the boiler.

13:06.211 --> 13:08.213
Yeah, I called him earlier.
Boiler's sorted.

13:08.214 --> 13:11.939
Yeah, I called him earlier.
Boiler's sorted.
You called Super Hans about the
boiler? Super Hans is our plumber?

13:11.940 --> 13:14.062
No, not Hans, his mate.
His mate's a plumber.

13:14.063 --> 13:17.427
Oh, great(!) I wonder if he appears
on the CORGI Gas Safe Register?

13:17.428 --> 13:20.392
Or just the Sex Offenders'?!

13:20.393 --> 13:22.676
'That's right,
pay Hans to do the plumbing,

13:22.677 --> 13:24.599
'swap the cow for some magic beans.'

13:24.600 --> 13:26.762
Half a monkey, as requested.

13:26.763 --> 13:28.444
'Why am I dealing in animals?'

13:28.445 --> 13:30.968
'No animal-based transaction
has ever gone well.'

13:30.969 --> 13:32.331
It's for parts and that.

13:32.332 --> 13:35.816
'I'll probably end up with half
a Ford Escort and some porno tapes

13:35.817 --> 13:37.579
'and we'll call it all square.'

13:37.580 --> 13:39.502
Is he...the plumber?

13:39.503 --> 13:43.508
Relax, Mark. We can definitely
do plumbing, it's not an issue.

13:43.509 --> 13:46.432
Trojan's very capable
after his sleep.

13:46.433 --> 13:48.956
Plumbing's just fucking Lego, innit?

13:48.957 --> 13:52.963
Water Lego. So, how's it all
going with Soph and the baby?

13:53.444 --> 13:55.567
You know, for a while
it's been pretty boring

13:55.568 --> 13:57.890
but I think we're getting
to the utterly terrifying bit.

13:57.891 --> 14:01.015
Take my advice,
stay away from the goal end, mate.

14:01.016 --> 14:01.736
Yeah?

14:01.737 --> 14:04.220
Yeah?
Yeah. You don't wanna
get thinking about that.

14:04.221 --> 14:06.303
It's like the Channel Tunnel -

14:06.304 --> 14:08.947
lovely, it's all
about your holidays,

14:08.948 --> 14:12.112
but imagine you saw a fucking
huge baby come out of it.

14:12.113 --> 14:13.915
Never be the same again.

14:13.916 --> 14:14.676
Right.

14:14.677 --> 14:16.679
Right.
One other tip... Trip.

14:16.680 --> 14:17.360
What?

14:17.361 --> 14:19.484
What?
Trip your fucking nuts off,
makes it amazing.

14:19.485 --> 14:20.806
Isn't it pretty amazing anyway?

14:20.807 --> 14:22.608
Isn't it pretty amazing anyway?
Dunno. Yeah, maybe,

14:22.609 --> 14:26.575
but if you'retrippingand you're
having a baby, it's like "Fuck!",

14:26.576 --> 14:28.698
you know? You see a little guy
come out of there,

14:28.699 --> 14:31.903
what's gonna happen next?
Frogs out of her arsehole?

14:31.904 --> 14:35.268
Milk out of her ears?
Anything's possible.

14:35.269 --> 14:36.310
Oi.

14:36.311 --> 14:37.351
What?

14:37.352 --> 14:38.393
Let's drive.

14:38.394 --> 14:39.875
'If those two fix my boiler,

14:39.876 --> 14:43.120
'I think it will be more surprising
than if Sophie gave birth

14:43.121 --> 14:45.764
'to a working replica
of Stephenson's Rocket.'

14:45.765 --> 14:49.049
Hi, Soph, back now.
Can I do anything?

14:49.050 --> 14:49.490
SOPHIE MOANS

14:49.491 --> 14:52.054
SOPHIE MOANS
You're doing great,
Sophie, you're doing good.

14:52.055 --> 14:56.060
'Oh, God, the screaming. Poor Sophie.
I definitely couldn't give birth.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.386
'I want to call Dignitas
when I get lumber pain.'

14:59.387 --> 15:02.270
Now, don't push
if you don't need to.

15:02.271 --> 15:06.276
Take a rest, Sophie, hmm?
You're doing well.

15:07.038 --> 15:10.643
'I can't just keep standing to
attention like Captain Mark Phillips.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.888
'Could march around the room
like Nelson on his quarterdeck.

15:13.889 --> 15:15.210
'I'm just a spare part!'

15:15.211 --> 15:17.614
Why don't you stop walking round
like that and come over here?

15:17.615 --> 15:20.819
Why don't you stop walking round
like that and come over here?
'And the fun part is,
everything I do is basically wrong.

15:20.820 --> 15:24.184
'If I can just get hold of a hand,
that might feel useful.'

15:24.185 --> 15:26.347
Oh, it's now, Mark, it's now!

15:26.348 --> 15:30.354
Right, right, yes, I'm sure, but
just don't use all your energy,

15:30.355 --> 15:32.236
cos you did say that eight hours ago,

15:32.237 --> 15:35.722
and it wasn't "now", and I don't
wanna be a doubting Thomas, but...

15:35.723 --> 15:37.965
Aargh!

15:37.966 --> 15:41.411
Bastard, bastard, fat bastard!

15:41.412 --> 15:43.895
'Is that for me
or just general bastarding?'

15:43.896 --> 15:46.418
Oh, fuck off, fuck off!

15:46.419 --> 15:49.463
'If she keeps saying "Fuck off",
I might fuck off.

15:49.464 --> 15:51.386
'That's gotta be within your rights,

15:51.387 --> 15:55.392
'to fuck off if someone repeatedly
screams at you to fuck off.'

15:55.554 --> 15:57.235
Can I...

15:57.236 --> 15:59.639
I just need to nip
to the little boys' room.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.802
'Yeah, the little boys' room.

16:01.803 --> 16:04.486
'For little boys.'

16:04.487 --> 16:06.049
There we go.

16:06.050 --> 16:07.892
One for you and one for Ben.

16:07.893 --> 16:10.736
Thanks, Jez.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.380
I'll have Ben's for him, shall I?

16:13.381 --> 16:15.784
Here's to you, Ben.

16:15.785 --> 16:18.989
I guess, I mean,
the thing I think is,

16:18.990 --> 16:22.915
if he doesn't make it, God forbid,
at least he lived to the max.

16:22.916 --> 16:26.921
The Iron Man... We think we were
once in the same bar as Banksy.

16:27.123 --> 16:28.924
Wow, yeah, I mean,

16:28.925 --> 16:31.288
there's a time for everything,
isn't there, you know?

16:31.289 --> 16:34.253
There's a time for golf,
a time for stew...

16:34.254 --> 16:35.935
Mmm. Yeah.

16:35.936 --> 16:37.017
'Come on, Guru Jez!'

16:37.018 --> 16:39.541
I mean, it's the whole
circle of life, isn't it?

16:39.542 --> 16:43.547
I mean, if you believe in
reincarnation, imagine if hewent

16:44.229 --> 16:48.234
at the exact same moment that
my friend's baby was born.

16:48.275 --> 16:52.281
Ben's spirit, his essence,
might live on,

16:52.402 --> 16:54.764
Bluetoothed into the baby.

16:54.765 --> 16:57.449
Yeah, I suppose I could
accept that, in a way.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.492
It's just him dangling, you know?

16:59.493 --> 17:03.458
We need to get you some answers.
Is he going to pull through?

17:03.459 --> 17:04.859
You need to know.

17:04.861 --> 17:06.142
'Ineed to know.

character in a weepy,

the leading man in a porno!'

'Yeah, OK, off to the toilet,
have a wee and then back in.

'I could walk quicker, but it's
interesting to note that I'm not.

describe in court as a normal pace,

17:22.769 --> 17:25.893
'but which I think is actually
slightly slower than normal.

might do in my situation.

This is difficult, but if he does
make it through, will he still be...

18:42.853 --> 18:46.858
operating from
below the waistal area?

18:47.019 --> 18:47.539
You mean...

18:47.540 --> 18:49.182
You mean...
Will he still be able to...

18:49.183 --> 18:51.906
communicate...with his...

18:51.907 --> 18:53.468
communication rod,

18:53.469 --> 18:56.393
or will he no longer be able to...

18:56.394 --> 18:59.918
lift the drawbridge, so to speak?
I'm thinking about Zara's needs.

18:59.919 --> 19:02.883
Look, I can't speculate on that,
but I'll be frank with you.

19:02.884 --> 19:06.008
We really need to see some movement
in the next 24 hours from Ben

19:06.009 --> 19:08.291
if a full recovery
is going to be on the cards.

19:08.292 --> 19:09.694
Thank you, doctor.

19:09.695 --> 19:11.376
'I'm 24 hours from Tulsa.'

19:11.377 --> 19:12.698
Thanks, Jez.

19:12.699 --> 19:15.863
'Finally, I'm in pole position.
Ben checks out, I check in.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.547
'I mean, I definitely,
definitely hope he doesn't,

19:18.548 --> 19:19.869
'but if he does, then...'

19:19.870 --> 19:21.232
Uh!

19:21.233 --> 19:22.073
What, Jeremy?

19:22.074 --> 19:23.114
What, Jeremy?
N-nothing.

19:23.115 --> 19:24.797
'Don't tell her,
don't raise her hopes.

19:24.798 --> 19:27.081
'Could have been anything -
phantom toe syndrome,

19:27.082 --> 19:29.244
'methane build-up,
disturbance in the force...

19:29.245 --> 19:30.726
'Oh, bollocks.'

19:30.727 --> 19:34.732
Zara, I think Ben's trying to
tell you something with his foot.

19:37.257 --> 19:41.263
Oh, my God, look! He's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, Jez!

19:41.544 --> 19:43.506
That's brilliant, Zara!

19:43.507 --> 19:45.990
'Fucking great. The mummy returns.

19:45.991 --> 19:47.993
'Finally find
the woman of my dreams,

19:47.994 --> 19:51.118
'and her boyfriend reanimates.'

19:51.119 --> 19:52.159
Fuck you! Fuck you!

19:52.160 --> 19:53.522
Fuck you!

19:53.523 --> 19:55.485
Nice.

19:55.486 --> 19:56.406
Jez.

19:56.407 --> 19:57.448
Jez.
Who's the jerk?

19:57.449 --> 20:01.454
Easy, buddy. I went to see Soph.
Why are you not in there?

20:01.495 --> 20:02.736
Yeah, well...

20:02.737 --> 20:06.742
Sophie wanted me to grab five
and play some Lethal Enforcers.

20:06.783 --> 20:07.383
Really?

20:07.384 --> 20:11.269
Really?
Yeah, she was all, "Grab five,
Mark, you deserve it, I'll be fine".

20:11.270 --> 20:13.152
She didn't mention that.

20:13.153 --> 20:14.915
The midwife didn't mention that.

20:14.916 --> 20:17.078
Yeah, I know,
that's because I'm lying.

20:17.079 --> 20:19.602
Look, Mark, I get it.
If this was happening to me,

20:19.603 --> 20:22.006
I'd be doing what you're doing
100 times over,

20:22.007 --> 20:23.809
but you don't want
to look back on today

20:23.810 --> 20:26.853
thinking when your baby was being
born, you were taking out a ninja.

20:26.854 --> 20:28.336
Yakuza!

20:28.337 --> 20:30.419
You need to get back in there.

20:30.420 --> 20:34.024
'He's right. Thank God I didn't do
bottle-of-whiskey-and-random-EasyJet.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.949
'I can still pull this round.'

20:36.950 --> 20:38.271
(HOWLS)

20:38.272 --> 20:40.875
Hi. Oh, you're not...

20:40.876 --> 20:44.881
'That could so easily have been me -
a useless gnome, fishing for turds.'

20:45.483 --> 20:47.165
Sorry, this should be my birth.
Where's...?

20:47.166 --> 20:49.288
Sorry, this should be my birth.
Where's...?
Sophie Chapman is in theatre three.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.451
Theatre?

20:51.452 --> 20:54.977
'Theatre! Nothing good has ever
happened in a theatre. Oh, fuck!'

20:54.978 --> 20:56.299
Sophie, are you OK?

20:56.300 --> 20:58.262
Yeah, I am.

20:58.263 --> 21:01.307
I'm so sorry I went. I just...
I don't know what to say.

21:01.308 --> 21:04.832
Did you go? I've been pretty out
of it. How long were you gone for?

21:04.833 --> 21:06.475
Oh, how long?

21:06.476 --> 21:09.479
Oh, ages, like...

21:09.480 --> 21:11.122
three or four minutes.

21:11.123 --> 21:13.606
'This is amazing.
I could have finished the level,

21:13.607 --> 21:16.170
'had an Angry Whopper
and upgraded my phone tariff.'

21:16.171 --> 21:18.734
Everything slowed down
and we wanted to get the baby out,

21:18.735 --> 21:19.976
so we decided to come
for a Caesarean section.

21:19.977 --> 21:23.060
so we decided to come
for a Caesarean section.
That's brilliant.
I love the salad, now try the birth.

21:23.061 --> 21:25.664
The... Caesar,

21:25.665 --> 21:29.671
Caesarean salad? Sorry, I'm gabbling.
I'm just happy it's all OK.

21:30.112 --> 21:31.473
How's it looking down there?

21:31.474 --> 21:32.114
Oh...

21:32.115 --> 21:33.917
Oh...
You might not necessarily want to.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.720
'Holy fuck! Living innards.

21:35.721 --> 21:39.726
'I thought now it'd all be hi-tech,
chip and pin, not London Dungeon!'

21:39.847 --> 21:40.888
Is it OK?

21:40.889 --> 21:41.930
Yeah.

21:41.931 --> 21:42.611
Yeah?

21:42.612 --> 21:43.893
Yeah?
All...good, all great.

21:43.894 --> 21:46.336
'The screen's there for a reason.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.860
'There's a reason
they put Guantanamo on Cuba.'

21:48.861 --> 21:51.344
Now you might feel a bit
of a tug, baby's coming out.

21:51.345 --> 21:53.948
OK. Oh, it's like someone's
doing the washing up.

21:53.949 --> 21:54.549
Yeah, I can feel that.

21:54.550 --> 21:55.711
Yeah, I can feel that.
'Yeah, I imagine so,

21:55.712 --> 21:59.717
'because a human being is being
heaved out of your body.

22:00.199 --> 22:02.522
'Oh, my goodness!

22:02.523 --> 22:03.483
Do you want to cut the cord?

22:03.484 --> 22:05.606
Do you want to cut the cord?
'No! Do you want
to do some credit rating

22:05.607 --> 22:08.411
'or work in a Mexican restaurant?
Let's stick to our jobs!'

22:08.412 --> 22:09.052
Do people normally...

22:09.053 --> 22:10.774
Do people normally...
Yep.

22:10.775 --> 22:12.056
Go on, Mark.

22:12.057 --> 22:13.418
Oh, OK.

22:13.419 --> 22:16.744
'Great. Bet I do it wrong and they
laugh. Humiliated in front of my son

22:16.745 --> 22:18.106
'within ten seconds of his birth.'

22:18.107 --> 22:20.189
Wow. It's sinewy.

22:20.190 --> 22:22.352
'God! I can't get any purchase.

22:22.353 --> 22:25.277
'Thought it would be like Sarah
Ferguson cutting a ribbon,

22:25.278 --> 22:29.003
'but it's much more meaty, like
sawing a dog's leg in half.

22:29.004 --> 22:32.448
'Oh, my God. There he is.
I've got a baby.

22:32.449 --> 22:36.374
'Maybe I might be...
a good person from now on.

22:36.375 --> 22:39.819
'That might be a good idea.
Yeah, lead a wholesome life

22:39.820 --> 22:43.105
'and be a decent citizen
and make the whole world OK,

22:43.106 --> 22:46.630
'and, yeah, this is a biggy,
this is definitely a biggy!

'Maybe my son
can sort climate change.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.756
'He might figure out cold fusion!

22:50.757 --> 22:53.360
'Not as one of the main guys,
that's unrealistic,

22:53.361 --> 22:55.364
'but in an administrative capacity.'

22:55.365 --> 22:58.168
Oh, my God.
You're a dad.

22:58.169 --> 22:58.929
I know.

22:58.930 --> 23:00.331
I know.
Wow.

23:00.332 --> 23:03.136
Listen, this probably doesn't
matter right now, but Hans called.

23:03.137 --> 23:03.576
Oh?

23:03.577 --> 23:04.978
Oh?
It's all sorted.

23:04.979 --> 23:06.541
New boiler's up and running

23:06.542 --> 23:09.305
and there's minimal water damage.
He sent a photo.

23:09.306 --> 23:10.707
Minimal water damage?

23:10.708 --> 23:12.470
Minimal water damage.

23:12.471 --> 23:15.154
Here you go, here's your son.

23:15.155 --> 23:19.160
'Oh, my God.'

23:20.163 --> 23:24.168
My son.
