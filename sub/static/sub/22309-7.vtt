All right, gentlemen.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.758
We'll start with Jamie's weapon.

39:46.802 --> 39:49.219
(J.)
He did a beautiful
Damascus blade.

39:49.262 --> 39:51.054
There was a distinct bend.

39:51.098 --> 39:54.182
Definitely curves
off to one side.

39:54.226 --> 39:57.227
See there's big shiny silver
on the edges,

39:57.270 --> 39:59.354
and I worry that
he brought things down too far

39:59.398 --> 40:00.688
and actually weakened his edge.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.065
And I think that's
where we get

40:02.109 --> 40:03.441
a lot of this deformation
from there.

40:03.485 --> 40:04.692
(Dave)
He's put an amazing amount

40:04.736 --> 40:06.152
of detail into this sword.

40:06.196 --> 40:08.696
The pattern
on the blade is spectacular.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.449
The "fortune favors
the bold" is a nice touch.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.451
I think it's a beautiful piece.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.578
(Doug)
Design-wise,
because it's rounded,

40:15.622 --> 40:16.913
it did roll in my hand,

40:16.957 --> 40:17.956
preventing me from
really putting

40:17.999 --> 40:19.624
a lot of better cuts in there,

40:19.668 --> 40:21.376
but it's sharp enough
to cut through the vines.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.670
It's a very beautiful blade.

40:23.713 --> 40:27.382
Moving on to Mareko's weapon.

40:27.426 --> 40:30.385
(Dave)
Right off the bat,
I think his handle bent.

40:30.429 --> 40:31.845
They're talking about
the handle.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.097
In the strength test,
the tang started to bend

40:34.141 --> 40:35.432
within the handle.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.725
It actually takes
almost an S-bend,

40:37.769 --> 40:40.228
but, you know,
his design is beautiful.

40:40.272 --> 40:42.856
(Doug)
Well, this blade,
the balance alone,

40:42.899 --> 40:45.024
the fit and finish,
the way it felt in the hand,

40:45.068 --> 40:46.443
it is a performance blade.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.820
In this slice test,
the handle construction

40:48.864 --> 40:50.488
did not roll off my hand.

40:50.532 --> 40:53.741
I think it performed
much better than Jamie's blade.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.827
Taking into consideration
all these factors,

40:55.871 --> 40:57.620
have you judges
reached a decision

40:57.664 --> 41:00.290
about who's gonna be the
<i> Forged in Fire</i> champion today?

41:00.333 --> 41:02.083
Absolutely.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.251
Tell me 'cause I don't know.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.044
I don't know who it's gonna be.

Jamie, Mareko,

41:09.759 --> 41:11.301
in just five days,

41:11.344 --> 41:14.053
you have both produced
a pair of gladius swords,

outstanding work.

41:17.017 --> 41:20.310
Mareko, that is one
of the most beautiful pieces

41:20.353 --> 41:22.687
we've ever had on the show,

41:22.731 --> 41:25.940
but man,
that handle is an issue.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.276
Having a tang
that's gonna bend or deflect

41:28.320 --> 41:29.819
in a combat situation,

Comments for Jamie?

41:34.451 --> 41:36.951
Jamie,
beautiful Damascus blade.

41:36.995 --> 41:40.538
You went a lower layer count,
so you get a bolder pattern.

41:40.582 --> 41:42.457
The only issue I really
have with the blade,

41:42.501 --> 41:45.960
you had some damage on the edge
in the strength test,

41:46.004 --> 41:48.087
and also you actually
gave us blade

41:48.131 --> 41:50.006
that had a bend down it

41:50.050 --> 41:53.176
before we even started
the testing.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.928
That hurt you
in the strength test some.

41:54.971 --> 41:57.514
Mm-hmm.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.516
There can only be
one champion.

Mareko, your blade

42:13.448 --> 42:16.032
Mareko,
I honestly love your sword,

42:16.076 --> 42:18.952
but functionality
is the key

42:18.995 --> 42:22.205
and just cannot overlook
that handle coming apart.

Mareko, please surrender
your weapon.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.334
Definitely sucks,

really nice work.
