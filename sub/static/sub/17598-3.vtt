LABOURED BREATHING

01:16.050 --> 01:17.090
Hello?

01:17.090 --> 01:18.200
- Hello?
-  We need to talk.

01:26.010 --> 01:29.210
- Did you tell anyone 
-  
-  that you were going there?

01:30.010 --> 01:31.010
No.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.060
Did anyone see you?

01:34.110 --> 01:36.110
There weren't any witnesses.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.100
- Iwan Thomas's death 
-  
-  will have to be investigated.

01:42.050 --> 01:46.100
- An independent officer will be sent 
-  
-  to run the investigation.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.130
As for you...

01:49.080 --> 01:53.150
- ..you'll have to give them 
-  
-  all the support that they need.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.100
I thought you had this covered.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.000
I thought so, too.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.150
Devil's Bridge?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.200
Eh?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.050
Of all places!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.100
I wasn't thinking...

02:35.020 --> 02:36.170
I lost control.

02:40.190 --> 02:43.090
There's no point panicking now.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.050
- We'll have to wait 
-  
-  and see what happens.

02:48.030 --> 02:52.020
- Get up in the morning, 
-  
-  put on a clean shirt...

02:52.150 --> 02:56.100
- ..and go to work 
-  
-  as if nothing has happened.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.200
We need to tell Blake that...

03:02.200 --> 03:04.100
- We need to tell Blake that...
-  I'll talk to Blake.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.050
You go home.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.140
- There's nothing 
-  
-  we can do about it now.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
Thank you.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.100
Thank you.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.030
The call came in an hour ago.

04:56.180 --> 04:57.200
SOCO?

04:57.200 --> 04:59.200
- SOCO?
-  They've just arrived, ma'am.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.150
Who found her?

05:01.150 --> 05:03.200
- Who found her?
-  A couple of young poachers.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.100
They had the shock of their lives.

05:06.150 --> 05:08.070
Where's DCI Mathias?

05:08.070 --> 05:10.130
- Where's DCI Mathias?
-  We can't reach him, ma'am.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.100
- We took statements from the lads 
-  
-  and sent them home, ma'am.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.150
DC Ellis phoned.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.150
- He was looking for you. 
-  
-  It sounded urgent.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.040
Thank you.

06:49.100 --> 06:54.000
- Her name's Laura Dean. Her boyfriend 
-  
-  reported her missing yesterday.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.140
She's a curator at the art college.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.140
Have you spoken to them?

06:58.190 --> 07:02.040
- I'll do it this morning. 
-  
-  We've only had a few hours.

07:02.140 --> 07:03.100
Where have you been?

07:03.100 --> 07:04.200
- Where have you been?
-  Sorry, I was...

07:05.000 --> 07:05.180
What have we got?

07:05.180 --> 07:06.230
- What have we got?
-  Laura Dean, 24.

07:07.030 --> 07:09.140
Poachers found her after midnight.

07:09.190 --> 07:11.220
And we tried calling you.

07:12.070 --> 07:13.220
She was strangled, sir.

07:14.020 --> 07:17.070
- Her naked body was found buried 
-  
-  and wrapped in plastic.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.070
Forensics are examining her now.

07:21.050 --> 07:25.050
- She was meant to be with 
-  
-  an old college friend in Manchester.

07:25.100 --> 07:29.060
- Her boyfriend reported her missing 
-  
-  when she didn't come back.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.110
When did he last speak to her?

07:30.110 --> 07:31.110
- When did he last speak to her?
-  Friday.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.130
- He called her friend. 
-  
-  They hadn't spoken for years.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.090
What's his name?

07:36.090 --> 07:38.170
- What's his name?
-  The boyfriend's name is Ifan Riley.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.000
Mr Riley?

08:44.100 --> 08:46.200
When did you last speak to Laura?

08:49.100 --> 08:51.000
Friday morning.

08:51.150 --> 08:53.200
Before I went to work.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.150
Didn't she call after she arrived?

08:56.150 --> 08:59.000
- Didn't she call after she arrived?
-  We don't always call each other.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.000
I just let her have a good time.

09:03.050 --> 09:05.140
Did she go away a lot?

09:05.240 --> 09:10.160
- Only when she catalogued 
-  
-  a new art collection.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.200
- Sometimes, she'd stay over 
-  
-  to save her driving.

09:18.120 --> 09:24.000
- She went to the opening of 
-  
-  a new gallery on Wednesday night...

09:24.050 --> 09:25.150
..in Caernarfon.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.090
Was she alone?

09:27.090 --> 09:28.190
- Was she alone?
-  Yes.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.180
Are you sure?

09:33.050 --> 09:35.150
I spoke to her before going to bed.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.050
What time was that?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.200
Around ten.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.100
Where?

09:48.150 --> 09:49.200
Sorry?

09:50.050 --> 09:51.200
Where did you find her?

09:54.100 --> 09:57.050
In the woods near Trefenter.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.150
- We need to piece together 
-  
-  what happened to her.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.200
Is there anyone we should speak to?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.100
A friend?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.050
A work colleague?

10:15.020 --> 10:16.120
Naomi.

10:17.230 --> 10:19.080
In the college.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.140
I don't know her surname.

12:20.010 --> 12:23.030

13:01.230 --> 13:04.020
When did you last see her?

13:05.050 --> 13:06.150
Thursday.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.050
- The day after 
-  
-  the gallery opening in Caernarfon.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.160
She didn't mention it.

13:19.210 --> 13:24.140
- Did she mention going to Manchester 
-  
-  for the weekend to see friends?

13:32.010 --> 13:33.160
She was seeing someone.

13:34.010 --> 13:35.070
Who?

13:36.080 --> 13:37.140
Lewis John.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.240
The painter?

13:40.040 --> 13:42.110
He asked her to model for him.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.050
Was she having an affair?

13:45.050 --> 13:46.100
- Was she having an affair?
-  I don't know.

13:46.150 --> 13:49.080
- Maybe she thought 
-  
-  it was more than it was.

13:49.130 --> 13:52.030
She stopped talking to me about it.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.100
I couldn't keep lying for her.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.200
Ifan adored her, but he was so...

13:58.150 --> 14:00.190
..so protective of her.

14:02.070 --> 14:04.220
These are sketches of Laura.

14:05.050 --> 14:07.050
Did Lewis Jones draw them?

14:11.240 --> 14:14.090
She was obsessed with him.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.240
Mrs John?

15:04.130 --> 15:05.170
Is your husband here?

15:05.170 --> 15:08.090
- Is your husband here?
-  Lewis is in the studio.

15:08.190 --> 15:10.100
Where's that?

15:12.230 --> 15:16.100
- Have you got time 
-  
-  to answer some questions?

15:16.150 --> 15:17.200
Of course.

15:31.240 --> 15:35.190
- I'd offer you a drink, 
-  
-  but it's probably too early for you.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.170
Just a bit.

15:43.070 --> 15:45.030
Beautiful, aren't they?

15:46.150 --> 15:49.050
- It takes years 
-  
-  to perfect the form...

15:49.100 --> 15:51.080
..to smooth the edges.

15:52.150 --> 15:55.200
I keep them as a reminder.

15:58.150 --> 15:59.150
Oh, yeah?

16:01.050 --> 16:02.050
Of what?

16:03.230 --> 16:05.080
Perfection.

16:06.150 --> 16:08.200
All these paintings...

16:09.170 --> 16:11.160
Are they of Laura Dean?

16:13.090 --> 16:15.170
You're not sure.

16:16.150 --> 16:19.200
- This world is obsessed 
-  
-  with who people are.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.130
I paint what they are.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.110
Do you remember her?

16:25.110 --> 16:26.160
- Do you remember her?
-  Yes.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.100
We found her body this morning.

16:34.110 --> 16:37.010
Someone murdered her.

16:37.110 --> 16:39.160
When did you last see Laura?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.050
Wednesday night.

16:43.110 --> 16:45.060
She came to the house.

16:46.050 --> 16:48.200
She sat for Lewis.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.200
They worked late.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.060
She stayed the night.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.220
In the studio?

16:56.160 --> 16:57.210
Yes.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.210
Did she leave on Thursday morning?

17:01.210 --> 17:04.170
- Did she leave on Thursday morning?
-  Yes, before breakfast.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.150
Did you see her leave?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.030
No.

17:10.150 --> 17:14.050
- Have you and your husband 
-  
-  spoken to her since then?

17:14.099 --> 17:15.119
No.

17:27.150 --> 17:30.150
- Where was your husband 
-  
-  on Friday night?

17:31.100 --> 17:32.200
In the studio.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.100
Working.

17:36.140 --> 17:37.240
Repainting.

17:39.050 --> 17:40.150
Changing old work.

17:41.050 --> 17:43.050
It's part of the process.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.200
Was he alone?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.050
Yes.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.010
He was alone.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.210
All night?

17:53.010 --> 17:54.110
All night.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.050
There was something about her.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.100
A sadness.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.000
And a beauty.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
- Did you sleep with her 
-  
-  on Wednesday night?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.050
Yes.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.150
It wasn't the first time.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.100
- No, there was 
-  
-  an attraction between us.

18:19.150 --> 18:23.000
- I was attracted to her, 
-  
-  and she was attracted to me.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.150
She'd undress...

18:27.000 --> 18:28.100
..and sit for me.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.100
- Sometimes, it led to sex, 
-  
-  but it didn't always.

18:34.050 --> 18:36.050
Part of the process.

18:37.140 --> 18:40.190
- If that's how you want 
-  
-  to describe it, then, yes.

18:46.150 --> 18:48.140
Do you sleep with all the models?

18:48.140 --> 18:51.000
- Do you sleep with all the models?
-  No, not all of them.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.000
- Did you know that Laura 
-  
-  had a boyfriend?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.150
- I never asked her 
-  
-  and she never told me.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.060
But you were close.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.060
Laura sat for me.

19:04.050 --> 19:07.100
- She lived her own life 
-  
-  for the rest of the time.

19:09.010 --> 19:13.210
- According to Laura's friend, your 
-  
-  relationship was more than sexual.

19:14.010 --> 19:16.200
- It wasn't 
-  
-  more or less than anything.

19:18.050 --> 19:21.110
- It was about painting 
-  
-  a form on canvas.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.040
Did Laura understand that?

19:29.050 --> 19:31.150
I don't know what Laura thought.

19:33.150 --> 19:36.150
- What happened between us 
-  
-  was consensual...

19:37.000 --> 19:38.210
..and natural.

19:39.010 --> 19:40.160
Does your wife know?

19:43.050 --> 19:45.200
My wife and I share everything.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.200
- Were you happy 
-  
-  with that arrangement?

19:54.050 --> 19:56.150
Are you always happy...

19:57.050 --> 19:58.190
..with your husband?

20:00.160 --> 20:02.160
I'm not married.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.150
- I stopped judging him 
-  
-  a long time ago.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.110
That's why we're still together.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.230
There have always been models.

20:17.030 --> 20:18.100
They are his tools.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.160
- The raw material 
-  
-  he needs to create his work.

20:22.010 --> 20:24.110
If he doesn't produce work...

20:27.050 --> 20:29.120
..we don't have anything to sell.

20:32.150 --> 20:36.050
- Laura was just the latest 
-  
-  in a long line, then.

Yes.

-  
-  He wants to speak to you.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.170
OK.

26:11.220 --> 26:14.040
If you remember anything, just...

26:14.090 --> 26:16.070
I've still got your number.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.200
Tom.

26:32.070 --> 26:33.170
You can't be here.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.140
Sir?

26:36.170 --> 26:38.070
You're too involved.

26:40.150 --> 26:42.000
What do you mean?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.150
You know how this works.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.050
We'll have to bring someone else in.

26:47.100 --> 26:51.100
- With all due respect, I'm the 
-  
-  best person to investigate this.

26:51.150 --> 26:54.100
- Tom, you're part 
-  
-  of an investigation...

26:54.150 --> 26:58.050
- ..where the person in question 
-  
-  has been found dead.

26:59.220 --> 27:04.210
- DS Owens will oversee things until 
-  
-  an independent investigator arrives.

27:05.060 --> 27:07.050
An independent investigator?

27:07.150 --> 27:09.120
It's procedure.

27:09.210 --> 27:13.240
- This has to be done properly. 
-  
-  There's nothing I can do about it.

27:16.140 --> 27:19.190
Go back to the Laura Dean case.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.030
If anything important arises...

27:23.130 --> 27:25.200
..I'll let you know.

27:43.180 --> 27:44.230
Tom?

27:44.230 --> 27:45.230
- Tom?
-  Yes?

27:49.050 --> 27:51.050
Where were you last night?

27:54.120 --> 27:55.220
I was out.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.100
I was out looking for Iwan Thomas.

28:08.130 --> 28:10.030
Did you find him?

28:11.240 --> 28:13.040
Mared.

28:13.190 --> 28:15.190
I wish I had.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.080
MOBILE PHONE

28:24.050 --> 28:25.100
Lloyd?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.200
Is he there now?

28:30.150 --> 28:32.100
We're on our way.

29:56.150 --> 29:58.150
I needed to see the place.

30:03.150 --> 30:05.050
I loved her.

30:08.210 --> 30:11.110
Why wasn't that enough for her?

30:25.120 --> 30:27.120
Come on, Ifan.

30:34.110 --> 30:37.160
- She was seeing someone else, 
-  
-  wasn't she?

30:40.050 --> 30:42.000
Did he do this to her?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Where did you find him?

31:37.120 --> 31:39.220
In the ravine at Devil's Bridge.

31:44.100 --> 31:46.150
Iwan didn't kill himself.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.150
He found him, didn't he?

31:53.200 --> 31:56.190
- I saw him last night. 
-  
-  He was looking for Iwan.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.140
Who?

32:01.080 --> 32:02.180
Your boss.

32:08.010 --> 32:09.110
Mathias.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.000

32:22.170 --> 32:24.040
Take it forward.

32:32.220 --> 32:35.170
- He was right 
-  
-  when he said he waited for her.

32:38.230 --> 32:40.080
Sir?

32:40.180 --> 32:41.230
Lewis John.

32:42.030 --> 32:43.180
Nine years ago...

32:43.230 --> 32:47.150
- ..a 17-year-old girl 
-  
-  accused him of sexual assault...

32:47.200 --> 32:49.190
..but the case was dropped.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.140
We've got the original statements.

32:52.190 --> 32:53.240
What's her name?

32:53.240 --> 32:55.160
- What's her name?
-  Joanna Miller.

32:55.210 --> 32:57.180
She's a cook in Aberystwyth.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.050
Well done, Lloyd.

33:36.150 --> 33:40.000
- The investigation 
-  
-  will focus on DCI Mathias.

33:40.100 --> 33:44.150
- He's already in the frame 
-  
-  after the attack.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.100
That doesn't help us.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.050
Both Robert and I agree...

33:57.100 --> 34:00.050
- ..that it would be better 
-  
-  for everyone...

34:00.100 --> 34:03.240
- ..if his death 
-  
-  was ruled as a suicide.

34:06.100 --> 34:08.199
Then we can put it all behind us.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.050
Everything.

34:23.050 --> 34:27.100
- Do you know anything about the 
-  
-  investigator they are sending?

34:27.150 --> 34:30.000
They'll send whoever they want.

34:30.050 --> 34:32.000
It's out of my hands.

34:32.050 --> 34:34.150
- Do we need to worry 
-  
-  about the cousin?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.050
What does Gareth Thomas know?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.199
Iwan was a drinker.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.050
- He could have said 
-  
-  all sorts of things about us.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.000
The children's home.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.100
- The children's home.
-  Yes, I know.

34:48.150 --> 34:50.000
What came over you?

34:51.050 --> 34:53.000
You've put us all at risk.

35:11.050 --> 35:12.150
Can I help you?

35:20.130 --> 35:24.000
- If you're looking for DCI Mathias, 
-  
-  he isn't here.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.150
I wasn't looking for him.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.170
I'd like to speak to you.

35:44.000 --> 35:44.180
Joanna Miller?

35:44.180 --> 35:45.180
- Joanna Miller?
-  Yes?

35:45.230 --> 35:48.020
I'm DCI Mathias. This is DI Rhys.

35:48.070 --> 35:51.220
- We need to ask you 
-  
-  a few questions about Lewis John.

35:58.220 --> 36:00.120
That was years ago.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.000
I don't see him now.

36:04.140 --> 36:06.170
It's in the past.

36:07.020 --> 36:11.020
- You might be able to help with 
-  
-  something that isn't in the past.

36:11.120 --> 36:13.190
One of his models. Laura Dean.

36:13.240 --> 36:18.010
- We found her body 
-  
-  early this morning.

36:21.150 --> 36:24.150
- I've said everything 
-  
-  I want to say about him.

36:25.090 --> 36:26.240
It's all on record.

36:28.150 --> 36:30.100
That was a lifetime ago.

36:32.110 --> 36:33.210
It's fine.

36:34.170 --> 36:37.070
- If you want to talk 
-  
-  about anything...

36:42.030 --> 36:44.130
..just give us a call.

37:17.180 --> 37:19.130
It was a long time ago.

37:19.230 --> 37:21.080
Do you remember her?

37:22.150 --> 37:23.200
Joanna Miller?

37:24.000 --> 37:27.110
- She accused you of assault 
-  
-  when she was 17 years old.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.060
And she retracted it.

37:29.110 --> 37:33.030
- So, you admit to having a naked 
-  
-  17-year-old in your studio.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.230
She was never naked.

37:43.090 --> 37:45.190
Joanna had a crush on my husband.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.200
We were both aware of it.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.150
- We did our best 
-  
-  to bring it to a head.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.040
Did it work?

37:53.140 --> 37:57.240
- Jo mistook my interest in her 
-  
-  as something more.

37:59.090 --> 38:01.190
When Lewis finished his work...

38:02.040 --> 38:06.080
- ..she couldn't understand why 
-  
-  he didn't want to see her any more.

38:06.180 --> 38:09.050
She couldn't deal with it.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.070
She wanted revenge.

38:11.170 --> 38:14.050
- She was 17. 
-  
-  The same age as my daughter.

38:14.150 --> 38:16.060
You should understand, then.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.080
- You should understand, then.
-  Do I?

38:18.130 --> 38:21.150
- Was Laura Dean in love with you, 
-  
-  Mr John?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.050
No.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.140
It wasn't like that.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.150
She was unique.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.150
She was vulnerable.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.200
Just like Jo Miller.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.050
- You haven't got a clue 
-  
-  what these girls are like.

38:37.100 --> 38:41.000
- We're all guilty 
-  
-  of trying to attract attention...

38:41.050 --> 38:42.150
..at some point.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.030
I paint what's inside.

38:48.130 --> 38:50.030
Once I've found it...

38:51.160 --> 38:54.110
..I'll paint it and move on.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.070
- Do you really think 
-  
-  you can see inside people?

38:57.170 --> 38:59.210
Yes, I'd like to think so.

39:00.060 --> 39:04.160
- Do you want him to paint you, 
-  
-  Mr Mathias?

39:05.010 --> 39:06.120
That depends.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.140
- Do you think you can see inside me, 
-  
-  Mr John?

40:04.060 --> 40:05.060
Ifan!

40:06.010 --> 40:07.020
Ifan!

40:07.120 --> 40:08.230
What do you want?

40:08.230 --> 40:10.130
- What do you want?
-  I wanted to say sorry.

40:10.180 --> 40:14.080
- I should have said something 
-  
-  and told you about Laura.

40:14.130 --> 40:17.200
- I tried to make her stop 
-  
-  and tell you about it.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.100
I don't want to know!

40:19.150 --> 40:20.240
If I'd said something...

40:20.240 --> 40:22.140
- If I'd said something...
-  That's enough!

40:22.190 --> 40:24.030
Lies!

40:24.080 --> 40:25.180
From you and from her!

40:26.030 --> 40:28.240
- You're all liars 
-  
-  and you were all laughing at me.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.200
That isn't true, Ifan.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.050
- That isn't true, Ifan.
-  Leave me alone!

40:40.230 --> 40:42.030
DS Owens?

40:42.130 --> 40:44.120
Sir?

40:47.150 --> 40:50.200
- DS Owens, 
-  
-  this is Superintendent John Powell.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
- He'll be leading 
-  
-  the Iwan Thomas case.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.230
Hi.

40:58.080 --> 41:02.240
- I couldn't bring a deputy with me, 
-  
-  so I'd like you to work with me.

41:03.090 --> 41:06.080
- It's you who's been leading 
-  
-  the case so far.

41:06.180 --> 41:07.180
Great.

41:07.230 --> 41:12.090
- The Superintendent understands 
-  
-  if you're uncomfortable with it.

41:12.190 --> 41:15.190
If you feel too involved.

41:15.240 --> 41:19.020
No, I'm happy to continue with it.

41:20.130 --> 41:24.110
- You do understand the investigation 
-  
-  is centred on a man...

41:24.160 --> 41:28.000
- ..who's been 
-  
-  your superior for some time.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.170
DCI Mathias.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.120
Yes, sir.

41:33.060 --> 41:35.110
Does this bother you?

41:35.210 --> 41:36.210
No.

41:37.150 --> 41:39.020
Not at all, sir.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.190
Good.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.060
Let's see what you've got.

42:03.010 --> 42:04.010
Mathias!

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
- You killed Iwan. 
-  
-  He didn't kill himself.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.240
He would never do that.

42:10.090 --> 42:11.140
You killed him!

42:11.240 --> 42:12.240
Hey, leave him.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.170
- Hey, leave him.
-  Get off! Let me go!

42:15.020 --> 42:16.050
Let me go!

42:16.150 --> 42:17.240
Let him go!

42:23.140 --> 42:24.220
You killed him.

42:25.130 --> 42:26.200
Or drove him to it.

42:28.120 --> 42:31.160
His blood is on your hands!

43:38.050 --> 43:39.150
DCI Mathias.

43:41.100 --> 43:43.100
I've heard a lot about you.

43:45.070 --> 43:47.020
I'm sure you have.

43:52.050 --> 43:55.150
- I've asked DS Owens 
-  
-  to work with me on this.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.200
I take it that you don't mind.

43:58.050 --> 43:59.050
No.

43:59.100 --> 44:01.110
She's a good detective.

44:03.150 --> 44:06.100
We'll get to the bottom of this.

44:08.030 --> 44:10.120
Everyone can then move on.
