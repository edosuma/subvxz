WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:03.243
<i>Previously on "Blindspot"...</i>

00:05.378 --> 00:08.820
If that girl has information
about Daylight on her body,

00:08.855 --> 00:11.537
then we are in
very serious trouble.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.602
Let's talk about Jane Doe.

00:14.637 --> 00:17.074
(Weller) Guerrero's file number
is tattooed on Jane's body.

00:17.109 --> 00:18.156
What aren't you
telling me?

00:18.191 --> 00:20.627
Saul Guerrero was
a confidential informant.

00:20.662 --> 00:22.270
- I was his handler.
- Do you live here?

00:22.305 --> 00:24.139
Well, I'm not the gardener,
if that's what you're asking.

00:24.174 --> 00:26.509
Saul Guerrero,
you're under arrest.

00:26.566 --> 00:28.142
(cheering and applause)

00:28.180 --> 00:30.901
(Mayfair) I'm the last person
he wants to see right now.

00:30.936 --> 00:32.048
(Weller)
It has to be you.

00:32.188 --> 00:33.013
When you walked in there,

00:33.048 --> 00:35.427
there wasn't even a flicker
of recognition from Guerrero.

00:35.484 --> 00:36.725
You were never
his handler, were you?

00:36.760 --> 00:38.037
You've never even
met him before.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.442
Why is that case
on her body?

00:40.532 --> 00:43.486
Only three people in the world
know what I'm about to tell you.

00:43.529 --> 00:47.165
The truth...
it's called Daylight.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.527
_

00:59.016 --> 01:00.757
(Mayfair)
I was told to meet here.

01:00.802 --> 01:02.836
Yeah, so were we.

01:03.639 --> 01:05.191
- Bethany May...
- Mayfair, yes.

01:05.226 --> 01:06.783
Deputy Assistant
Director of the FBI.

01:06.853 --> 01:08.460
I know who you are.
Tom Carter.

01:08.495 --> 01:11.486
Deputy Executive Director,
CIA, I know you too.

01:11.585 --> 01:13.519
Sofia Varma.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.119
Deputy White House
Political Director.

01:17.173 --> 01:20.026
Looks like somebody's
collecting deputies, huh?

01:20.111 --> 01:21.890
I've seen you on TV

01:21.968 --> 01:23.328
standing behind
the president

01:23.376 --> 01:25.475
when he cut our
operating budget.

01:25.542 --> 01:27.167
You should complain to
the social programs

01:27.261 --> 01:29.729
that got your
reappropriations.

01:30.176 --> 01:32.558
I don't suppose you know
who we're meeting with

01:32.629 --> 01:34.062
out here on a school night?

01:34.346 --> 01:36.679
Chief of Staff
will see you now.

01:37.864 --> 01:40.143
The White House
Chief of Staff?

01:40.478 --> 01:43.213
Mr. Davenport's waiting.

01:45.193 --> 01:47.219
(Mayfair) The NSA spent
the last ten years

01:47.254 --> 01:50.289
gathering Intel on
American citizens.

01:50.473 --> 01:52.293
Until Douglas Winter
blew the whistle.

01:52.417 --> 01:54.233
They collected data
from everywhere...

01:54.268 --> 01:56.411
calls, texts, emails.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.794
All illegally obtained.

01:57.829 --> 02:01.322
And all extremely valuable.

02:01.924 --> 02:03.051
I was given

02:03.086 --> 02:06.668
an unofficial directive
to find creative ways

02:06.703 --> 02:09.048
to enable us to
use that information,

02:09.127 --> 02:10.312
make it actionable.

02:10.366 --> 02:11.119
By who?

02:11.167 --> 02:12.779
You don't want to know.

02:13.201 --> 02:16.963
Suffice to say,
Saul Guerrero

02:17.050 --> 02:19.775
was my creative way.

02:21.418 --> 02:23.443
He was a front.

02:23.589 --> 02:25.794
A way to launder
the NSA's illegal Intel.

02:25.829 --> 02:28.072
If we heard chatter
about drug shipments

02:28.107 --> 02:30.102
or the identity
of a murderer...

02:30.137 --> 02:31.888
whatever it was,

02:32.044 --> 02:36.225
on paper it was Saul Guerrero
who tipped me off.

02:36.288 --> 02:38.865
You knew Guerrero
was untouchable.

02:39.146 --> 02:40.675
Even if we did get him,

02:40.779 --> 02:41.984
of course he'd deny
being a rat.

02:42.019 --> 02:43.475
You counted on it.

02:43.940 --> 02:46.218
You lied
again and again.

02:46.262 --> 02:48.869
We were given
a shortcut,

02:49.049 --> 02:50.741
a way to cut
through red tape

02:50.776 --> 02:53.930
and put some very dangerous
people behind bars.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.571
People we could have
never otherwise convicted.

02:56.620 --> 02:58.816
Guerrero is the leader of
one of the most ruthless gangs

02:58.864 --> 03:00.049
in this country,

03:00.122 --> 03:02.148
and you let him stay active
to cover your own tracks?

03:02.190 --> 03:03.664
We would've brought
him in if we could have.

03:03.699 --> 03:04.738
I didn't know
where he was.

03:04.773 --> 03:07.094
His file number was
tattooed on Jane's body

03:07.129 --> 03:08.563
because of you.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.326
You're the case!

03:11.635 --> 03:14.177
So, what else do you know
that you're not telling me?

03:14.333 --> 03:16.074
Nothing.

03:16.666 --> 03:18.243
And why should
I believe you?

03:18.278 --> 03:20.886
Do you understand
what you have done?

03:21.046 --> 03:23.988
Believe me,
right or wrong,

03:24.070 --> 03:26.104
I understand.

03:27.652 --> 03:29.253
Weller!

03:37.161 --> 03:38.929
All right.

03:39.468 --> 03:42.486
Let's see what you got.

03:43.118 --> 03:45.052
(clears throat)

03:52.169 --> 03:53.803
(grunts)

03:55.458 --> 03:58.455
(grunting)

03:58.490 --> 04:01.071
Sorry.

04:01.144 --> 04:02.774
(grunting)

04:04.497 --> 04:06.498
(laughing)

04:08.740 --> 04:10.674
Hey, you two
better get in here.

04:12.470 --> 04:13.798
(Patterson)
Two NYPD officers

04:13.833 --> 04:16.408
were shot earlier this morning,
execution style.

04:16.442 --> 04:19.594
Officers Jake Schultz
and Sam Garrigan.

04:19.629 --> 04:21.244
I'm sure some of you
remember last fall

04:21.320 --> 04:23.506
a Brooklyn cop shot
an unarmed black teenager,

04:23.571 --> 04:26.326
LaMond Green, in a supermarket
parking lot.

04:26.361 --> 04:29.644
Schultz and Garrigan were two
of the five other officers

04:29.707 --> 04:30.698
that were on the scene.

04:30.798 --> 04:32.101
(Reade)
That video was everywhere.

04:32.170 --> 04:33.735
John Becker, the guy
who shot Green,

04:33.834 --> 04:34.889
wasn't even indicted.

04:34.951 --> 04:36.321
The protests almost
shut Brooklyn down.

04:36.434 --> 04:37.622
He just got
away with it?

04:37.690 --> 04:38.877
There's been a lot
of that going around.

04:38.971 --> 04:40.940
Becker got fired
and the Six-Five

04:40.975 --> 04:42.890
has been doing a lot
to clean up house since then.

04:42.925 --> 04:44.691
That's great, it's
a shame it takes a riot.

04:44.726 --> 04:46.946
(Mayfair) Schultz and Garrigan
were at the scene.

04:47.006 --> 04:49.040
Guilty by association.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.109
Maybe these are
payback killings.

04:51.144 --> 04:52.480
Before we jump
to conclusions,

04:52.515 --> 04:53.777
shouldn't we consider
the possibility

04:53.856 --> 04:55.154
that this is unrelated?

04:55.204 --> 04:57.232
I don't think it is.

04:58.504 --> 05:00.631
Is this connected
to one of my tattoos?

05:00.666 --> 05:02.034
LaMond Green was
the last in a long line

05:02.069 --> 05:04.929
of questionable incidents
from the 65th precinct.

05:04.964 --> 05:06.530
I didn't know this
until this morning

05:06.565 --> 05:08.508
but the community has
a nickname for them.

05:08.586 --> 05:10.308
The Brooklyn Butchers.

05:10.371 --> 05:11.690
And this was
spray-painted

05:11.757 --> 05:13.572
on Schultz and Garrigan's
patrol car.

05:13.607 --> 05:14.806
(Zapata)
"Butcher the butchers."

05:14.841 --> 05:16.308
They're coming after
the Six-Five.

05:16.353 --> 05:17.902
(Jane)
Wait, that... that's on me.

05:17.937 --> 05:19.256
The butcher's knife tattoo.

05:19.291 --> 05:20.120
(Zapata)
Exactly.

05:20.155 --> 05:21.784
(Weller)
Butchers of Brooklyn Six-Five.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.468
And here's the scary part.

05:25.149 --> 05:27.124
The 65th precinct
is in the crosshairs.

05:27.140 --> 05:28.554
How could the people
who did this to me

05:28.589 --> 05:31.016
have predicted
these cop killings?

05:31.157 --> 05:32.300
I don't know.

05:32.679 --> 05:35.376
But if this is
tattooed on you,

05:35.453 --> 05:38.416
the chances are these murders
are just the start.

Sync and corrections by explosiveskull

05:57.145 --> 05:59.295
(Weller) I still say that we can
handle this on our own.

05:59.391 --> 06:00.969
We've dealt with
more serious cases.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.668
Not politically.

06:03.168 --> 06:05.150
We don't want another
Ferguson or Baltimore.

06:05.215 --> 06:08.386
And D.C. feels more comfortable
with me on the ground out here.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.572
NYPD is not gonna be thrilled
to hand this over to us.

06:10.628 --> 06:11.787
- Why not?
- Cops tend to want

06:11.822 --> 06:13.988
to take down cop killers
on their own.

06:14.152 --> 06:14.991
They're funny that way.

06:15.055 --> 06:16.215
I think it would
be better for everyone...

06:16.288 --> 06:18.223
I'm done talking
about this.

06:18.471 --> 06:21.230
When we walk in there,
we walk in united.

06:21.269 --> 06:22.707
Understood?

06:24.814 --> 06:26.941
- Excuse me, sir.
- FBI.

06:27.688 --> 06:31.908
Schultz and Garrigan
were our brothers.

06:32.035 --> 06:34.512
We need to extend
our support to their loved ones

06:34.575 --> 06:38.511
as much as we can during
this difficult time.

06:42.794 --> 06:45.381
The worst call
a police captain can get

06:45.421 --> 06:47.923
is the one I got
this morning.

06:48.336 --> 06:50.810
And I hope
to never get one again.

06:51.363 --> 06:52.212
(clears throat)

06:52.545 --> 06:55.834
It is this sick individual's
expressed intent

06:55.869 --> 06:57.871
to come and take
more of us out,

06:57.906 --> 07:00.681
which is why our friends
at the FBI

07:00.790 --> 07:03.527
are taking over
the investigation.

07:03.562 --> 07:06.348
(overlapping contention)

07:06.383 --> 07:08.696
Hey, hey,
settle down!

07:08.743 --> 07:10.653
We all want
the same thing here,

07:10.706 --> 07:12.787
and I will appreciate
your cooperation

07:12.831 --> 07:14.884
in this investigation.

07:15.973 --> 07:17.329
Assistant Director Mayfair?

07:17.373 --> 07:18.740
- We don't need the Feds.
- Yeah!

07:18.839 --> 07:20.429
We can catch the son
of a bitch ourselves.

07:20.518 --> 07:21.793
Sergeant, that's enough.

07:21.867 --> 07:24.535
- (man) Yo, that's our neighborhood.
- (woman) That's right.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.263
We're here to help.
We have the resources.

07:28.298 --> 07:29.613
You don't know
the streets like we do.

07:29.671 --> 07:33.110
And we don't have targets
on our backs like you do.

07:33.249 --> 07:36.766
I know you're upset,
but one single misstep here

07:36.837 --> 07:40.541
could undo all the efforts
that you've made to repair

07:40.594 --> 07:43.881
the relationships between
you and this community.

07:43.952 --> 07:47.432
Your job today is
the same as it always is.

07:47.523 --> 07:51.426
Stay safe and protect
the people of Brooklyn.

07:51.490 --> 07:56.461
Our job is to catch the killer
and bring them to justice.

07:56.562 --> 07:59.248
Now, let's all go
and do our work.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.166
All right, that's it.
Dismissed.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.942
Thanks for the intro.

08:05.977 --> 08:09.271
Although "take over" isn't
the phrase I'd have used today.

08:09.306 --> 08:12.449
I didn't care about semantics,
I just wanna catch this guy.

08:12.550 --> 08:13.927
And I'd appreciate it
if you keep me looped in

08:13.994 --> 08:15.113
on your investigation.

08:15.157 --> 08:16.632
Of course.

08:16.702 --> 08:18.014
We understand that
Officer Garrigan

08:18.049 --> 08:19.978
was working alone yesterday.

08:20.110 --> 08:21.795
We're gonna need to talk
to Schultz's partner.

08:21.845 --> 08:23.512
Tracy Dunn, fine.

08:23.605 --> 08:25.120
I suggest you do it
on your own turf.

08:25.155 --> 08:26.706
Things are a bit
on edge around here.

08:26.890 --> 08:28.891
I can see that.

08:31.768 --> 08:33.121
Schultz and Garrigan
had nothing to do

08:33.169 --> 08:35.235
with LaMond Green's murder.

08:35.341 --> 08:37.679
Becker shot that kid before
we even had time to react.

08:37.715 --> 08:38.950
(Weller)
But you were there on camera.

08:39.022 --> 08:40.634
So, in the eyes of
the community,

08:40.672 --> 08:41.837
you're guilty by association.

08:41.928 --> 08:43.897
Then how come
I'm not dead?

08:44.014 --> 08:45.251
Why'd the killer wait
for me to leave?

08:45.286 --> 08:47.382
You were around the corner
at the Queensdale Deli.

08:47.417 --> 08:48.973
Is that correct?

08:49.022 --> 08:49.667
Yeah.

08:49.702 --> 08:52.099
Do you recall
anything unusual?

08:52.137 --> 08:53.582
Oh, this is
a waste of time.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.239
I already spoke to
our guys about this.

08:55.274 --> 08:56.860
Well, now, you can
talk to us.

08:56.895 --> 08:58.203
Do you want to catch
the person who killed

08:58.238 --> 09:00.706
your fellow officers
or do you wanna posture?

09:00.785 --> 09:02.800
- Officer Dunn?
- (sighs)

09:02.879 --> 09:05.078
I was NYPD.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.981
Five years
at the Nine-Six.

09:08.334 --> 09:09.801
I lost a partner too.

09:09.969 --> 09:11.648
Routine traffic stop,
it was over

09:11.683 --> 09:13.870
before we even knew
what was happening.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.254
You have a long road
ahead of you,

09:15.289 --> 09:17.466
but you are
gonna be okay.

09:19.859 --> 09:22.980
We can catch
this guy, Tracy,

09:23.092 --> 09:25.193
but we need your help.

09:26.796 --> 09:29.402
I didn't see anything.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.223
By the time I got back,
he was dead.

09:32.311 --> 09:35.030
Did Schultz or Garrigan have
any enemies on the street?

09:35.065 --> 09:37.995
No, they weren't
those kind of cops.

09:38.097 --> 09:41.802
Schultz was... good, fair.

09:41.983 --> 09:46.318
I always felt safe
riding with him, but...

09:46.521 --> 09:47.339
But what?

09:47.374 --> 09:50.455
I don't know, he just seemed
distracted lately.

09:50.595 --> 09:52.441
Said he had
a hard time sleeping.

09:52.519 --> 09:55.161
I asked about it,
he just shrugged it off.

09:57.713 --> 09:59.453
I let him down.

09:59.529 --> 10:00.863
It's not your fault.

10:01.056 --> 10:02.899
They won't let me
go back to work.

10:03.031 --> 10:05.134
What am I supposed to do,
just sit around my apartment

10:05.169 --> 10:08.438
while Sam and Jake's killer
is out there somewhere?

10:11.008 --> 10:12.384
You're wearing
a bodycam.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.807
Yeah.
(sniffles)

10:13.893 --> 10:17.668
Um, we got them after
LaMond Green was killed.

10:17.762 --> 10:19.186
It's a pilot program.

10:19.257 --> 10:20.260
A lot of guys didn't
like it at first,

10:20.295 --> 10:23.007
but we haven't had a single
brutality complaint since.

10:23.088 --> 10:24.808
So, the program's going
national now.

10:24.910 --> 10:26.668
You keep them on
all shift?

10:26.777 --> 10:28.999
Yeah, video uploads
to the servers

10:29.040 --> 10:30.456
back at the precinct
automatically,

10:30.491 --> 10:32.617
but we've already gone over
the footage of the murders.

10:32.669 --> 10:34.133
It's okay, we're just
being thorough.

10:34.225 --> 10:36.046
(Weller)
I'll talk to Captain Rossi,

10:36.136 --> 10:37.709
see if we can get Schultz
and Garrigan's footage.

10:37.774 --> 10:40.814
No.
I got it.

10:44.079 --> 10:47.486
This is footage from Schultz
and Garrigan's last shift.

10:50.342 --> 10:52.581
- (gunshots)
- <i>Oh!</i>

10:52.633 --> 10:55.769
<i>I can't breathe.
I can't... help!</i>

10:55.804 --> 10:56.976
<i>(groaning, coughing)</i>

10:57.043 --> 11:00.211
<i>Oh, my God, Schultz!
Stay with me!</i>

11:00.313 --> 11:01.631
<i>Officer down,
officer down.</i>

11:01.670 --> 11:03.743
<i>I repeat, officer down!</i>

11:03.778 --> 11:05.144
(radio static)

11:05.253 --> 11:07.423
No, let her go.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.638
Just give her
some time.

11:08.768 --> 11:09.800
We gotta go back
through Schultz

11:09.847 --> 11:12.438
and Garrigan's bodycam footage,
see what else we can find.

11:12.475 --> 11:15.185
You got it.
Just FYI, it's a lot of footage.

11:15.284 --> 11:17.892
I'll round up as many eyes
as possible to help.

11:20.905 --> 11:22.037
(Sofia)
With Davenport's help

11:22.077 --> 11:26.326
this Daylight program,
it could really work.

11:26.772 --> 11:29.047
This is not a program.

11:29.188 --> 11:33.053
Where is it written down?
What bill allows it?

11:33.186 --> 11:36.101
It's illegal,
not to mention unconscionable.

11:36.179 --> 11:38.194
If the public ever found out
the true reach

11:38.229 --> 11:39.756
of the NSA surveillance...

11:39.833 --> 11:42.490
The public wants us to win
the war on terror.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.503
This isn't about terrorism.

11:44.614 --> 11:47.162
This is about
the complete invasion

11:47.224 --> 11:50.068
of privacy for every
citizen in this country.

11:50.123 --> 11:51.256
If people aren't
breaking the law,

11:51.291 --> 11:52.271
what do they care
if we're listening?

11:52.306 --> 11:56.006
We would be breaking the law
if we used any of this Intel.

11:56.381 --> 11:58.350
If it ever got out,
we could go to prison.

11:58.414 --> 12:00.252
Whoa! Whoa.

12:00.338 --> 12:01.651
And who's talking
about prison?

12:01.706 --> 12:03.808
We just received a directive

12:03.859 --> 12:05.898
from the White House
Chief of Staff,

12:05.954 --> 12:08.069
and I for one
intend to act on it.

12:08.155 --> 12:11.923
Bethany, if any
one of us says no,

12:11.989 --> 12:14.196
this all falls apart.

12:14.345 --> 12:16.953
Davenport won't
risk moving forward

12:17.055 --> 12:19.366
if there's an outsider
who knows about this.

12:19.460 --> 12:22.159
All right, there's no room
for gray here.

12:22.194 --> 12:25.782
Nobody leaves until all
three of us are on board.

12:27.685 --> 12:29.319
Can we trust you?

12:31.000 --> 12:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:38.888 --> 12:40.622
- Here.
- Oh.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.193
Thank you.

12:53.747 --> 12:55.908
What's going on
with you and Mayfair?

12:56.835 --> 12:58.469
Nothing.

12:59.923 --> 13:01.542
Are we friends?

13:02.112 --> 13:03.733
Of course.

13:04.193 --> 13:06.487
Well, you know everything
there is to know about me

13:06.522 --> 13:10.809
but... you hardly ever...

13:11.895 --> 13:13.784
I wanna help.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.927
I can't really
talk about it.

13:24.903 --> 13:27.944
What do you do
if someone you trusted

13:28.426 --> 13:30.443
lets you down?

13:30.940 --> 13:35.450
Well, if it's forgivable,
I think you forgive her.

13:35.546 --> 13:36.595
And what if you can't?

13:36.652 --> 13:38.098
I'm not sure.

13:38.213 --> 13:40.647
None of you have
ever let me down.

13:41.703 --> 13:42.915
Sir? Ma'am?

13:42.978 --> 13:44.747
I think I've got
something over here.

13:46.854 --> 13:48.629
Hey, guys, you might
want to see this.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.096
What do you got?

13:52.176 --> 13:54.041
This is from Schultz's
bodycam last week.

13:54.165 --> 13:55.610
According to the log,
he and Dunn had split up

13:55.666 --> 13:58.409
to canvas for witnesses
to a gas station robbery.

13:58.949 --> 14:00.724
<i>Wanna ruin my life, man, huh?</i>

14:00.898 --> 14:02.980
<i>Huh?!
I'm gonna kill you!</i>

14:03.061 --> 14:04.142
<i>I'm gonna kill you, man!</i>

14:04.237 --> 14:05.794
I sort of feel like
that could be our guy.

14:05.883 --> 14:07.017
We got an ID on him?

14:07.109 --> 14:09.291
- That's Ricky Holt.
- You know him?

14:09.372 --> 14:11.230
(Reade) That damn sure is
Ricky Holt, the running back.

14:11.277 --> 14:12.713
I didn't recognize him
in his street clothes.

14:12.790 --> 14:13.736
Yeah, I'd recognize him
anywhere,

14:13.790 --> 14:14.834
he busted his knee
last season

14:14.873 --> 14:16.863
and ruined his chances
at the playoffs.

14:16.941 --> 14:18.641
He spent the rest
of the year partying.

14:18.718 --> 14:20.471
Why would he be upset
with Schultz?

14:20.580 --> 14:21.955
He doesn't come up
in any police reports.

14:22.048 --> 14:23.631
What kind of bad blood
would be between a cop

14:23.758 --> 14:25.064
and a pro football player?

14:25.132 --> 14:26.994
And why wouldn't
Schultz report it?

14:27.099 --> 14:28.058
Holt has no record

14:28.134 --> 14:30.052
but he does own
a registered gun.

14:30.131 --> 14:32.452
Same caliber as the one that
killed Garrigan and Schultz.

14:32.565 --> 14:34.504
- Where do we find this guy?
- I found a location.

14:34.566 --> 14:36.556
Some wannabe groupie
just posted a picture

14:36.612 --> 14:39.362
of her and him at a party
20 minutes ago.

14:43.051 --> 14:44.083
Reade...

14:44.191 --> 14:45.343
you and Jane
go around the back,

14:45.433 --> 14:47.968
through the garage,
see what's in there.

14:50.494 --> 14:52.829
(overlapping chatter)

14:56.063 --> 14:58.786
We're the FBI.
Here to see Ricky Holt.

14:58.847 --> 15:01.248
Come on in,
Ricky's around here somewhere.

15:04.759 --> 15:06.260
Ricky Holt?

15:14.806 --> 15:16.674
(Weller)
Stop!

15:20.867 --> 15:23.302
Ricky! Stop!

15:29.315 --> 15:30.682
Stop!

15:39.526 --> 15:41.193
(Weller)
Stay down!

15:51.673 --> 15:53.345
They in with Holt yet?

15:53.509 --> 15:55.689
Just sweating him
out a little first.

15:55.901 --> 15:58.735
You ever thought about
being a cornerback?

15:59.656 --> 16:01.261
(chuckles)

16:02.291 --> 16:04.728
I'm sorry about
your old partner.

16:05.928 --> 16:07.862
I didn't...

16:09.443 --> 16:11.439
This must be hard for you.

16:13.854 --> 16:17.234
When Andy got shot, there was
nothing I could do about it.

16:17.682 --> 16:20.624
I can do something about this.

16:21.913 --> 16:24.114
Yeah.

16:24.478 --> 16:26.461
(Weller) <i>Sorry for keeping
you waiting, Ricky.</i>

16:26.528 --> 16:28.357
Let's talk about
Officer Jake Schultz.

16:28.419 --> 16:30.620
- Lawyer.
- Ricky, you're a hell of a ballplayer.

16:30.711 --> 16:32.930
But right now, we got you
on resisting arrest

16:32.991 --> 16:34.523
and assaulting
a federal officer.

16:34.586 --> 16:36.238
(Weller)
We can make that go away

16:36.273 --> 16:37.151
if you tell us
everything you know

16:37.202 --> 16:39.528
about Officer Jake Schultz.
What's your problem with him?

16:39.623 --> 16:42.168
He's a dirty cop.
That's my problem.

16:42.237 --> 16:45.153
He busted into this
apartment I was at last month.

16:45.219 --> 16:46.995
My music was too loud
or something like that,

16:47.070 --> 16:49.433
so my idiot neighbors
called in a domestic dispute.

16:49.531 --> 16:52.419
Your music,
your neighbors.

16:52.801 --> 16:53.714
Sounds like your apartment.

16:53.767 --> 16:55.521
No, man.
I... I mean, yeah,

16:55.587 --> 16:58.230
but it's not like...
you know, my man...

16:58.342 --> 17:00.930
Okay, so Schultz
busts in, and?

17:01.006 --> 17:03.604
A week later I get
this anonymous letter,

17:03.687 --> 17:05.594
<i>these pictures of me
having sex that night.</i>

17:05.651 --> 17:08.644
<i>Saying I gotta pay 50-grand
or they gonna send 'em</i>

17:08.679 --> 17:11.492
to Deadspin or whatever.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.819
Schultz was blackmailing you?

17:15.653 --> 17:16.357
I don't get it, Ricky.

17:16.404 --> 17:18.138
You're not married.

17:18.346 --> 17:20.916
Was it a teammate's wife
or something?

17:22.188 --> 17:24.303
Last chance, Ricky.

17:25.885 --> 17:28.407
Resisting arrest,
assaulting a federal officer.

17:28.444 --> 17:30.131
If you wanna play ball again,
then you gotta...

17:30.229 --> 17:34.345
It was a guy.
All right?

17:37.138 --> 17:39.623
You do realize there's out
professional athletes

17:39.676 --> 17:40.678
these days, right?

17:40.730 --> 17:41.951
Yeah.

17:42.107 --> 17:44.149
And look how their
careers are going.

17:44.219 --> 17:45.916
Come on, man, I'll lose
my endorsements.

17:45.978 --> 17:47.008
No team will want me.

17:47.084 --> 17:49.735
I do my lap on the morning
talk show circuit, then what?

17:49.796 --> 17:52.183
If you paid him off,
why did you confront him?

17:52.267 --> 17:55.451
It turns out, he wanted me to
deposit 50-grand every month.

17:55.489 --> 17:56.749
I mean, the whole thing
was messing me up,

17:56.804 --> 17:58.362
so I got in his face.

17:58.463 --> 17:59.885
What did these pics
look like?

18:00.021 --> 18:02.626
Weird, like...
like... like...

18:02.918 --> 18:04.957
like a picture
of a picture.

18:06.055 --> 18:08.376
The pictures must be
from Schultz's bodycam.

18:08.517 --> 18:10.595
Yo, are y'all trying to
bust Schultz or something?

18:10.657 --> 18:13.369
'Cause I'm not saying
any of this in court.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.684
Schultz was murdered.

18:17.159 --> 18:18.415
I want my lawyer.

18:18.476 --> 18:20.419
Schultz caught Holt on video,
then took pictures

18:20.489 --> 18:22.797
from the computers
back at the precinct.

18:23.547 --> 18:25.272
(scoffs)
These aren't the crosshairs

18:25.335 --> 18:27.632
from a rifle scope,
it's a camera lens.

18:27.692 --> 18:29.090
The people who
tattooed me didn't know

18:29.125 --> 18:30.480
the policemen were gonna die.

18:30.515 --> 18:32.193
They knew Brooklyn
Six-Five's bodycams

18:32.274 --> 18:33.685
were being used
for blackmail.

18:33.744 --> 18:35.912
It's another
corruption case.

18:37.169 --> 18:38.874
They just got out
of interrogation.

18:38.945 --> 18:41.104
Schultz was
blackmailing Holt.

18:42.670 --> 18:45.456
This is a very expensive
bottle of wine.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.027
I didn't forget
my own birthday, did I?

18:47.062 --> 18:48.829
Mmm.

18:53.776 --> 18:57.171
Carter tells me
you're not using Daylight.

19:00.023 --> 19:02.293
I'm still assessing
the Intel,

19:02.345 --> 19:04.040
- figuring out the best way...
- Bethany.

19:04.111 --> 19:07.324
It's not as simple
for me.

19:07.785 --> 19:09.617
If you and Carter
find something useful,

19:09.683 --> 19:10.726
you can use it.

19:10.787 --> 19:13.086
Me, I have to deal
with the legal system...

19:13.141 --> 19:14.211
judges, lawyers.

19:14.262 --> 19:17.163
Congress almost defunded
Planned Parenthood.

19:17.272 --> 19:18.888
Did you know that?

19:19.096 --> 19:21.215
Daylight gave us
the leverage we needed

19:21.254 --> 19:22.950
to fight them off.

19:23.012 --> 19:24.816
(scoffs)
You blackmailed

19:24.887 --> 19:26.655
- sitting Congressmen...
- What are you saying?

19:26.690 --> 19:30.888
The lobby groups do,
I know... buy them off,

19:30.952 --> 19:32.030
look for weaknesses.

19:32.065 --> 19:33.457
This is not
the same thing.

19:33.512 --> 19:35.779
One of our most
vocal opponents

19:35.961 --> 19:37.577
was Dave Grantham.

19:37.711 --> 19:39.635
Then Daylight intercepts
a phone call

19:39.714 --> 19:42.646
between him
and a campaign staffer.

19:43.036 --> 19:45.051
He was paying for
her abortion.

19:45.167 --> 19:47.284
We needed his vote, he didn't
want to lose the next election.

19:47.384 --> 19:49.458
Now, millions of women
won't lose

19:49.497 --> 19:50.679
their reproductive
healthcare.

19:50.811 --> 19:53.720
And criminals have been
gaming the system forever,

19:53.857 --> 19:56.206
and if I don't game
them back, I'm a sucker.

19:56.257 --> 19:58.480
So, why can't
I pull the trigger?

19:58.913 --> 20:00.736
Because you're good.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.190
But lives
are being ruined

20:02.225 --> 20:04.576
because you aren't
using this.

20:04.863 --> 20:07.164
Where is the good in that?

20:10.029 --> 20:11.874
(Jane) So Schultz was blackmailing
the football player,

20:11.962 --> 20:14.011
so do you think his partner
was in on it too?

20:14.072 --> 20:15.172
Don't know.

20:15.216 --> 20:15.966
Let's find her
and ask her.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.643
Shouldn't we give
NYPD the heads up?

20:17.715 --> 20:19.582
Not until we have
something concrete.

20:19.639 --> 20:21.041
We also don't know
who else is involved.

20:21.136 --> 20:23.251
(Mayfair) I'll call the precinct
and find out her location.

20:23.298 --> 20:24.722
We need to talk
to her immediately.

20:24.781 --> 20:27.810
Guys, Officer Dunn
has been shot.

20:28.682 --> 20:32.852
♪ ♪

20:49.655 --> 20:50.896
Another cop shot dead

20:50.978 --> 20:53.474
while our only suspect
was in police custody.

20:53.561 --> 20:55.754
(Weller) Holt was still free when Schultz
and Garrigan were killed.

20:55.821 --> 20:56.973
This doesn't
clear him from that.

20:57.035 --> 20:58.738
It does.
Forensics just came back.

20:58.793 --> 21:00.204
Holt's gun does not
match the gun

21:00.256 --> 21:01.733
used in
the original murders.

21:01.780 --> 21:04.390
And it looks like the same gun
was used here to kill Dunn.

21:04.485 --> 21:07.288
One gun, one killer.
That rules out Holt.

21:07.388 --> 21:09.524
Anything on that blackmail
account that Holt told us about?

21:09.577 --> 21:10.438
It's a dummy account opened

21:10.507 --> 21:12.420
with a dead guy's
social security number.

21:12.486 --> 21:14.469
We're running a full check
now to find a connection.

21:14.553 --> 21:15.853
- So, who's been withdrawing?
- No one.

21:15.933 --> 21:16.660
All the funds
have been transferred

21:16.734 --> 21:18.505
to an untraceable
overseas account.

21:18.577 --> 21:19.463
Of course, they have.

21:19.557 --> 21:21.187
But get this, there's been
dozens of deposits.

21:21.253 --> 21:23.568
Some for ten, 20,
even $100,000.

21:23.672 --> 21:25.593
Holt only deposited
50K once.

21:25.662 --> 21:28.356
So, Schultz has been
extorting a number of people.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.538
Any one of them
could be the killer.

21:32.004 --> 21:34.409
Just went over Schultz,
Garrigan and Dunn's financials.

21:34.503 --> 21:35.820
If they were
blackmailing people,

21:35.876 --> 21:37.811
they must have been
forensic-level accountants.

21:37.886 --> 21:39.461
No big purchases?

21:39.625 --> 21:41.285
No connections
to overseas accounts?

21:41.345 --> 21:42.736
We even checked under
their mattresses.

21:42.781 --> 21:44.959
So, maybe it wasn't
these three extorting people.

21:45.029 --> 21:45.992
Could someone else
have accessed

21:46.034 --> 21:47.331
their bodycam footage?

21:47.407 --> 21:49.742
Yeah, from the precinct's
archive program.

21:49.817 --> 21:52.687
Can we trace it back to see
which officer accessed what?

21:52.777 --> 21:55.527
No, because they only have
two login passwords...

21:55.652 --> 21:57.471
one for admin
and one for patrol,

21:57.563 --> 21:59.201
and everyone knows them.

21:59.295 --> 22:02.238
So, Holt assumed Schultz
was his blackmailer

22:02.318 --> 22:04.046
because he's the one
that found him.

22:04.143 --> 22:05.362
But it could
have been anyone

22:05.397 --> 22:07.337
accessing
the precinct's archive.

22:07.486 --> 22:10.408
Whoever this was,
they were very careful.

22:10.494 --> 22:12.325
And you guys were right
that they were taking photos

22:12.378 --> 22:14.061
of the footage with
their cell phones.

22:14.170 --> 22:15.958
So, they didn't leave
a trail by downloading it.

22:16.036 --> 22:19.079
We need to check every
phone in the precinct.

22:19.266 --> 22:20.975
We're gonna need
warrants for that.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.522
I'm well aware of that.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.343
Those cops just lost
three of their own.

22:24.389 --> 22:25.546
Do you really think
they're gonna stand

22:25.602 --> 22:27.186
on ceremony right now?

22:27.272 --> 22:28.475
I'm just making sure
that we're doing things

22:28.525 --> 22:30.259
the right way.

22:30.763 --> 22:32.611
In my office.

22:36.847 --> 22:38.784
I need you
to stand down.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.471
Whatever it is
between us,

22:40.592 --> 22:44.278
I do not want it interfering
with this investigation.

22:44.677 --> 22:45.993
The first time
I came in here,

22:46.100 --> 22:47.534
remember what you did?

22:47.679 --> 22:49.039
You showed me that letter
from the Bureau

22:49.109 --> 22:50.486
threatening
Martin Luther King

22:50.580 --> 22:52.500
back in the corrupt
Hoover days.

22:52.687 --> 22:54.630
A reminder not to
abuse our authority.

22:54.691 --> 22:55.609
Weller...

22:55.656 --> 22:57.652
You taught me how
to do this job.

22:57.902 --> 22:59.991
Everyone here looks
to me for what to do.

23:00.210 --> 23:01.518
I used to look at you.

23:01.619 --> 23:04.796
That's gone.
I can't trust you anymore.

23:12.450 --> 23:14.391
(reporter on radio) <i>Former NSA employee
Douglas Winter</i>

23:14.426 --> 23:16.762
<i>is blowing the whistle on
their surveillance program,</i>

23:16.797 --> 23:18.859
<i>claiming the NSA has been
illegally spying</i>

23:18.894 --> 23:20.739
<i>on U.S. citizens for years</i>

23:20.809 --> 23:22.992
<i>and that he has
the evidence to prove it.</i>

23:23.059 --> 23:25.092
<i>Winter maintains that
he is prepared to release</i>

23:25.131 --> 23:26.791
<i>thousands of documents
to the media</i>

23:26.849 --> 23:28.033
<i>once he has
secured asylum...</i>

23:28.068 --> 23:29.538
(radio shuts off)

23:32.179 --> 23:36.850
(rain pattering)

23:37.276 --> 23:40.724
And so it ends
where it began.

23:41.324 --> 23:42.457
New Jersey.

23:42.579 --> 23:43.770
I should have known
we were doomed.

23:43.832 --> 23:45.901
They know about
the NSA wiretapping.

23:45.971 --> 23:47.515
It doesn't mean they
know about Daylight.

23:47.550 --> 23:48.415
That doesn't matter.

23:48.450 --> 23:50.352
Winter just blew our
information pipeline.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.818
What does Davenport say?

23:51.934 --> 23:53.449
That he doesn't know
what I'm talking about,

23:53.501 --> 23:54.760
and stop calling
his office.

23:54.805 --> 23:56.118
No, we're on our own.

23:56.167 --> 23:58.129
We deserve
whatever happens.

23:58.164 --> 24:00.215
We should never have started
this in the first place.

24:00.296 --> 24:02.407
Hey! Why don't
you just save

24:02.487 --> 24:03.931
the resignation speech,
all right?

24:03.996 --> 24:05.941
We're not in front of
a Senate subcommittee yet,

24:05.976 --> 24:07.233
and I don't intend to be!

24:07.319 --> 24:09.135
You think that they
won't come after us?

24:09.307 --> 24:11.361
You actually think
they won't figure it out?

24:11.396 --> 24:14.245
I think that you need
to calm down and start

24:14.329 --> 24:17.026
being rational before you
do something you'll regret.

24:20.589 --> 24:21.789
I was looking through
Schultz's email,

24:21.863 --> 24:24.347
and I found an unsent draft
saying he thought somebody

24:24.397 --> 24:26.651
was using his
bodycam footage.

24:26.744 --> 24:27.812
"I don't know who or how,

24:27.900 --> 24:29.614
"but I'm scared to talk
to anyone about it,

24:29.649 --> 24:31.406
even my partner."

24:31.536 --> 24:33.778
It was addressed
to Internal Affairs.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.688
So Schultz wasn't
extorting anyone.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.011
But he knew somebody was.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.865
So, maybe the blackmailers
found out

24:39.900 --> 24:44.249
that he was talking to I.A.
and decided to stop him.

24:44.309 --> 24:47.669
And they killed Dunn because
she was close to Schultz.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.467
They couldn't risk her
knowing or finding out.

24:49.535 --> 24:52.190
All these cops were killed
by another cop?

24:52.235 --> 24:55.117
This wasn't revenge.
It was a cleanup.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.976
The graffiti made it
look like retaliation

24:57.011 --> 24:58.260
for Green getting shot,

24:58.310 --> 25:00.425
and no one suspects a police
cover-up for corruption.

25:00.514 --> 25:03.647
There's over 200 officers that
are working at that precinct.

25:03.682 --> 25:05.320
How do we know
which one's the killer?

25:05.440 --> 25:06.309
Follow the money.

25:06.356 --> 25:08.218
All right, this dead guy
with the dummy account,

25:08.288 --> 25:09.687
- who was he?
- Eddie Lombardi...

25:09.755 --> 25:12.976
85, no living family,
no criminal history.

25:13.063 --> 25:15.533
His building has had nine
domestic violence calls

25:15.568 --> 25:16.627
in the last year.

25:16.693 --> 25:18.044
Who answered
those DV calls?

25:18.103 --> 25:20.736
Seven of them were answered
by the same two beat cops...

25:20.806 --> 25:22.776
Costello and Johnson.

25:23.266 --> 25:24.701
I-It's complicated,
but they're laundering

25:24.757 --> 25:26.522
the money through a bunch
of different properties

25:26.557 --> 25:27.637
all around the country.

25:27.672 --> 25:29.852
Shell companies,
phony buyers.

25:29.894 --> 25:32.338
It's them...
it's Costello and Johnson.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.110
So, where are they now?

25:36.255 --> 25:39.083
Hello, Mrs. Schultz.
May we come in?

25:39.313 --> 25:41.742
(engine revving)

25:41.917 --> 25:43.798
Reade and Zapata should
reach Costello's apartment

25:43.834 --> 25:45.533
around the same time
we get to Johnson's.

25:45.615 --> 25:48.529
They're both off-duty, but
with their phones switched off.

25:48.564 --> 25:50.308
It's not a good sign,
is it?

25:50.441 --> 25:51.941
No.

25:53.789 --> 25:56.654
I've been thinking.

25:56.781 --> 25:58.772
I know you can't
tell me what Mayfair

25:58.822 --> 26:01.746
has done to upset you,
but...

26:03.781 --> 26:05.985
you're pretty stubborn.

26:06.157 --> 26:07.397
You make gut decisions,

26:07.432 --> 26:08.957
and I know they're
usually right.

26:09.028 --> 26:12.648
But I just hope
that you can try

26:12.710 --> 26:14.372
to see her side
of things.

26:14.498 --> 26:16.487
Because whatever she did,

26:16.641 --> 26:20.187
she's more than
just one mistake.

26:20.731 --> 26:23.366
(female computer voice)
<i>You have an incoming call.</i>

26:24.876 --> 26:26.481
Patterson, you're on.

26:26.516 --> 26:27.999
I've been looking into
Johnson and Costello's

26:28.066 --> 26:29.624
credit card purchases.

26:29.784 --> 26:32.250
Johnson bought a burner
cell phone from a gas station

26:32.311 --> 26:35.093
a few weeks before the blackmail
wire transfers started.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.110
Nice work.
Can you track it?

26:37.157 --> 26:38.919
One of them is at
Schultz's widow's house

26:38.954 --> 26:41.022
in Astoria right now.

26:41.907 --> 26:43.390
(beep)

26:43.640 --> 26:44.715
Call Reade.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.718
(phone line ringing)

26:46.753 --> 26:47.420
<i>Reade.</i>

26:47.455 --> 26:49.748
Costello and Johnson
are at the widow's house now.

26:49.783 --> 26:52.239
And so meet us there,
bring backup.

26:53.676 --> 26:56.298
Did you talk to
the FBI yet, Jenny?

26:56.548 --> 27:00.531
No, um... but I gave
them Jake's laptop.

27:00.846 --> 27:02.558
If you know something,
Jenny, you should...

27:02.667 --> 27:04.447
you should talk to us.

27:05.584 --> 27:06.799
(Mayfair)
Now, you understand why

27:06.834 --> 27:09.503
I wanted to tell you this
away from the precinct.

27:09.541 --> 27:12.125
I heard rumors they
were skimming cash

27:12.173 --> 27:14.871
off of seizures and drug busts.

27:15.615 --> 27:18.290
I couldn't prove anything,
but...

27:18.360 --> 27:20.196
(sighs) I thought
if I put 'em on a desk,

27:20.231 --> 27:22.101
what harm could they do?

27:22.136 --> 27:23.187
(phone ringing)

27:23.222 --> 27:24.876
Excuse me.

27:27.624 --> 27:29.524
- Hello?
- Mrs. Schultz, my name is Kurt Weller.

27:29.559 --> 27:30.919
I'm an agent with the FBI.

27:30.954 --> 27:32.718
<i>Listen to me,
this is very important.</i>

27:32.827 --> 27:34.322
<i>If Officers Costello
or Johnson</i>

27:34.357 --> 27:36.894
<i>show up to your house,
do not let them in.</i>

27:37.044 --> 27:39.795
It's no secret what they do
to cops behind bars.

27:39.830 --> 27:41.539
Costello and Johnson
are gonna do anything

27:41.608 --> 27:43.845
they have to
to stay out of prison.

27:43.993 --> 27:47.176
You go in there,
be ready for war.

27:49.444 --> 27:51.809
I'm afraid I can't right now,
I have guests.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.027
They're there already?

27:53.070 --> 27:54.823
Yes, that would be fine.

27:54.916 --> 27:56.296
Stay on the line
with me.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.688
- <i>We're almost...</i>
- (gasps)

27:57.803 --> 27:58.736
We...

28:00.790 --> 28:02.057
Who was that?

28:02.227 --> 28:03.734
What did Jake
tell you, Jenny?

28:03.880 --> 28:04.951
What do you know?

28:05.040 --> 28:06.700
I don't know.
I don't know, no...

28:06.758 --> 28:08.857
A lot of people are
worried about you.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.514
Out here,
you're all alone.

28:10.549 --> 28:11.487
They're worried about
what you're...

28:11.522 --> 28:14.825
what you're thinking,
what you might do.

28:15.303 --> 28:18.039
I found this in your
medicine cabinet.

28:18.338 --> 28:19.957
Is something keeping
you up at night?

28:20.075 --> 28:22.541
I know Jake had trouble
sleeping, isn't that right?

28:22.576 --> 28:23.609
Come on, she doesn't
know anything.

28:23.644 --> 28:25.094
Why don't you just take
a few of them and rest?

28:25.129 --> 28:26.322
(crying)
No, I don't want to.

28:26.357 --> 28:27.504
She doesn't know anything.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.238
I promise,
it'll help.

28:29.273 --> 28:31.141
(shrieking)

28:33.926 --> 28:36.430
- (gunfire)
- Jane, down!

28:48.016 --> 28:49.917
(gunfire)

29:00.110 --> 29:01.391
(whispering)
Stay there.

29:01.612 --> 29:02.696
Jane.

29:07.289 --> 29:08.877
Go. Go, go, go!

29:16.100 --> 29:17.334
Flash bang!

29:17.387 --> 29:18.721
Ohh!

29:19.234 --> 29:23.204
(high-pitched ringing)

29:28.195 --> 29:29.828
- Are you okay?
- (sobbing, panting)

29:30.525 --> 29:31.993
(gunshot)

29:34.384 --> 29:36.351
(high-pitched ringing)

29:46.423 --> 29:47.949
(muted gunfire)

29:49.129 --> 29:52.164
(ringing continues)

29:53.450 --> 29:55.017
(sirens approaching)

30:00.885 --> 30:02.071
How are your ears?

30:02.120 --> 30:03.443
(loudly)
What?

30:06.243 --> 30:08.648
(shouting)
The paramedics said...

30:08.723 --> 30:10.071
(in normal voice)
...that I'm fine.

30:10.106 --> 30:11.106
(laughing)

30:11.150 --> 30:13.051
Uhh.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.261
I'm all good.

30:15.335 --> 30:16.341
Did you hear
from the team?

30:16.415 --> 30:18.798
Yeah, Patterson hacked
Johnson's burner phone.

30:18.969 --> 30:21.448
Looks like that's how
he and Costello communicated.

30:21.565 --> 30:23.057
There were texts
that corresponded

30:23.127 --> 30:25.025
with the time of
the victims' deaths.

30:25.103 --> 30:26.789
They were coordinating
the shootings.

30:26.864 --> 30:27.998
Mm-hmm.

30:34.216 --> 30:36.801
(sighs, clears throat)

30:37.261 --> 30:39.147
You scared the hell
out of me.

30:39.455 --> 30:42.116
When that door closed
and I heard those shots,

30:42.244 --> 30:44.330
- I thought they...
- Jane.

30:44.398 --> 30:48.128
They didn't, okay?
I'm fine.

30:48.199 --> 30:49.633
(chuckles)

30:51.604 --> 30:53.546
Then talk to Mayfair.

30:55.749 --> 30:57.823
You never stop, do you?

30:57.980 --> 30:59.595
I guess I don't.

31:05.193 --> 31:06.875
Johnson's dead.

31:06.975 --> 31:08.596
And Costello
is being transported

31:08.631 --> 31:10.977
to a hospital in Queens.

31:11.118 --> 31:14.413
Also, we found
their burner phones,

31:14.481 --> 31:18.801
and it looks like you were
gonna be targeted next.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.466
I want to talk
to Costello.

31:20.501 --> 31:22.454
You're a little
close to this.

31:22.489 --> 31:23.772
Captain, why don't
you let us handle...

31:23.807 --> 31:25.620
She killed three
of my people.

31:25.685 --> 31:28.089
I want to talk to her.
I wanna look her in the eye.

31:28.124 --> 31:29.949
I'm owed that much.

31:30.031 --> 31:31.698
All right.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.329
I'll drive.

31:34.779 --> 31:36.388
What's going on?

31:36.423 --> 31:38.095
Pete Nelson
fell off the wagon.

31:38.130 --> 31:41.052
He... he caught a DUI.

31:41.087 --> 31:45.505
And his wife and children,
they left this morning.

31:45.565 --> 31:46.950
I destroyed
a good man's life.

31:46.985 --> 31:49.273
He struggled with
addiction in his past.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.518
A fact that I shared with
every major newspaper

31:52.553 --> 31:54.145
in the country.

31:54.297 --> 31:56.533
I cannot do this anymore,
I just...

31:56.644 --> 31:58.500
We need to get
out of here.

31:58.551 --> 32:00.896
I have a cousin
living in Hong Kong.

32:00.979 --> 32:03.147
It's full of expats,
the city is incredible.

32:03.205 --> 32:04.829
You should actually
see the harbor.

32:04.864 --> 32:05.996
It's just all lit up
at night...

32:06.031 --> 32:07.462
- You want me to go to Hong Kong?
- Yeah.

32:07.497 --> 32:08.870
If Daylight gets out,

32:08.966 --> 32:10.504
then we can avoid
extradition there.

32:10.575 --> 32:11.780
I mean, you and I
can just cross

32:11.815 --> 32:13.921
into mainland China
if we have to.

32:13.956 --> 32:16.423
I mean, it's just to
give us another chance.

32:16.458 --> 32:18.513
I don't want
to start over.

32:18.881 --> 32:19.755
My work is important to me...

32:19.790 --> 32:21.656
- Do you love me?
- Don't.

32:21.716 --> 32:22.910
Well, then move with me.

32:22.952 --> 32:24.628
Because there is no
future here for us.

32:24.663 --> 32:26.319
I mean, everything is
just crumbling around us.

32:26.354 --> 32:29.637
- Can't you see that?
- That's why I have to stay.

32:29.764 --> 32:32.246
If the truth about
Guerrero gets out,

32:32.336 --> 32:35.672
every person I put away
will be back out on the street,

32:35.707 --> 32:38.666
and I can't let
that happen.

32:38.849 --> 32:41.235
If we leave
and everything falls apart,

32:41.303 --> 32:43.170
it would have been
for nothing.

32:43.238 --> 32:46.807
You and Carter were the ones
that convinced me to do this.

32:48.198 --> 32:50.945
We were wrong, Bethany.

32:51.293 --> 32:53.661
We were so wrong.

33:01.634 --> 33:03.272
I should've done more
that just put Johnson

33:03.307 --> 33:04.936
and Costello behind a desk.

33:04.980 --> 33:06.915
You couldn't have known that
they were gonna blackmail

33:06.950 --> 33:09.350
Ricky Holt and all
those other people.

33:09.459 --> 33:11.778
Shaking down a football player
'cause he's in the closet.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.825
It just doesn't
get lower than that.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.061
Pretty low.

33:19.787 --> 33:21.174
Don't touch the gun.

33:21.272 --> 33:22.639
Drive.

33:25.492 --> 33:28.261
I didn't tell you
Ricky Holt was gay.

33:29.149 --> 33:31.316
All that footage
just sitting there, I...

33:31.381 --> 33:33.286
The program was about
to go national.

33:33.352 --> 33:34.717
You would've had
access to every...

33:34.775 --> 33:38.178
We only targeted people
that could afford it.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.664
These people,
they make more in a year

33:40.699 --> 33:42.667
than we make in a decade.

33:42.831 --> 33:44.059
And we give back
to the community.

33:44.094 --> 33:47.257
- People died.
- They weren't supposed to.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.932
Things... things just
got away from us.

33:52.052 --> 33:55.655
So turn yourself in,
explain that.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.449
Cops don't survive prison.

34:02.554 --> 34:03.690
Just drive.

34:03.763 --> 34:05.986
(tires screeching)

34:06.083 --> 34:08.150
No, no, no, no!

34:11.301 --> 34:13.902
(groans)

34:24.398 --> 34:26.648
- (knocking)
- Come in.

34:26.751 --> 34:28.326
(clears throat)

34:31.435 --> 34:33.092
What are you doing?

34:35.101 --> 34:36.577
Aren't they keeping
you here overnight?

34:36.612 --> 34:37.808
I don't like hospitals,

34:37.868 --> 34:40.335
and I've got
reports to write.

34:44.681 --> 34:46.786
Thanks for coming.

34:46.925 --> 34:48.348
I understand
you're angry...

34:48.382 --> 34:51.027
How many people did you
put away using Guerrero?

34:51.152 --> 34:52.830
You don't want to know.

34:52.938 --> 34:55.206
If I turn you in...

34:55.431 --> 34:57.402
all of those convictions
will be thrown out.

34:57.477 --> 35:00.048
They will all end up
back on the streets.

35:00.204 --> 35:01.627
How could you
have done this?

35:01.793 --> 35:05.741
We thought the benefits
outweighed the cost.

35:05.839 --> 35:07.740
We were wrong.

35:08.203 --> 35:11.639
I never meant to put you
in this situation.

35:13.577 --> 35:17.243
I keep that letter
to Dr. King on my wall

35:17.391 --> 35:21.892
to remind me that
I abused my power too.

35:22.057 --> 35:25.301
I've spent the last two years
trying to make up for that.

35:25.513 --> 35:26.769
Guerrero's
in custody now

35:26.842 --> 35:29.390
because of a clue
on Jane's body.

35:30.940 --> 35:33.150
The next one could have
your name on it.

35:33.228 --> 35:36.862
Whether it's me
or someone else...

35:36.971 --> 35:39.948
sooner or later someone's
gonna find out the truth.

35:43.113 --> 35:45.995
What happens if these people
are gunning for you?

35:46.986 --> 35:49.441
I'll figure
something out.

35:49.829 --> 35:51.963
I hope it was worth it.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.077
It has to be.

36:01.867 --> 36:05.002
(door opens, closes)

36:07.566 --> 36:10.808
Hey, you guys wanna grab
a drink with us?

36:10.992 --> 36:12.738
Nope.
I got a date tonight.

36:12.773 --> 36:13.768
With who?

36:13.803 --> 36:14.636
None of your business.

36:14.671 --> 36:15.713
If you don't wanna come,
just say so.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.431
You don't have to lie.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.219
(Zapata)
Ooh...

36:19.387 --> 36:21.607
Really?
The both of you now?

36:21.674 --> 36:22.580
(laughing)

36:22.654 --> 36:23.887
Have a good one.

36:25.178 --> 36:26.840
What about you?

36:28.077 --> 36:29.150
I'm tired.

36:29.202 --> 36:30.944
Come on.
One drink?

36:31.178 --> 36:34.165
Next time.
I promise.

36:34.281 --> 36:37.116
(Zapata)
Hey, Jane, you coming?

36:44.138 --> 36:46.739
(upbeat music playing)

36:48.761 --> 36:51.361
Okay, how was that?
That is a fireball.

36:51.396 --> 36:53.610
- That was a cherry bomb. Oh.
- No.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.674
- Mmm! Ugh.
- That's too sweet.

36:55.709 --> 36:58.573
We are gonna find
your drink if it kills us.

36:58.608 --> 37:02.073
Can we just stop trying to
solve puzzles for one night?

37:02.192 --> 37:03.659
(laughter)

37:04.826 --> 37:07.019
It is nice to drink
with people for a chance.

37:07.086 --> 37:09.933
(chuckles)
That went really dark.

37:09.971 --> 37:12.574
It must suck being cooped up in
that safe house all the time.

37:12.668 --> 37:14.271
Can I tell you
a secret?

37:14.386 --> 37:15.446
Mm-hmm.

37:15.557 --> 37:17.836
I've sl... I've slipped out
a few times.

37:17.941 --> 37:19.164
How?!

37:19.292 --> 37:20.586
Well, they're so worried
about people coming in

37:20.640 --> 37:22.958
that they don't
see me get out.

37:23.211 --> 37:24.885
What do you do?

37:24.987 --> 37:26.889
I... I walk around
and ride the subway

37:26.924 --> 37:29.993
and pretend like
I'm everybody else.

37:31.346 --> 37:32.744
I rode all the way to
Coney Island once.

37:32.779 --> 37:33.833
Ohh. I can't...

37:33.911 --> 37:35.200
I can't... you can't
tell me this.

37:35.235 --> 37:37.529
I would do the exact
same thing.

37:38.432 --> 37:40.566
(cell phone dings,
Patterson sighs)

37:42.029 --> 37:43.611
_

37:43.687 --> 37:46.118
Who's that,
library boy again?

37:46.180 --> 37:48.183
Who's library boy?

37:48.230 --> 37:50.164
- Just...
- Oh, library boy.

37:50.416 --> 37:51.400
With the pictures and...

37:51.483 --> 37:54.192
Yeah, he... we broke up.

37:54.227 --> 37:56.628
He... It's just...

37:56.987 --> 37:59.061
Come on, don't be
the sad girl at the bar

37:59.096 --> 38:00.518
looking at her phone.

38:00.593 --> 38:02.179
- Another round.
- (clears throat)

38:02.237 --> 38:04.346
Tonight we're gonna find out
what your favorite drink is.

38:04.393 --> 38:06.963
Tomorrow we're gonna
get you some new clothes.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.818
What's wrong
with my clothes?

38:18.736 --> 38:20.573
Oh, sorry.
(clears throat)

38:20.608 --> 38:22.114
Sarah's just putting
Sawyer to bed.

38:22.149 --> 38:24.852
She wasn't expecting
you home yet.

38:24.923 --> 38:26.308
I'll just say my goodbyes.

38:26.343 --> 38:28.391
You wanna pour me
one of those?

38:40.988 --> 38:43.873
Rough day
at the office?

38:44.073 --> 38:45.741
Yeah...

38:46.151 --> 38:48.816

I gave you the file,

40:43.797 --> 40:45.211
everything we know
about Jane Doe.

40:45.246 --> 40:46.793
Which is basically nothing.

40:46.828 --> 40:48.898
No, there's nothing in
that file that tells me

40:48.963 --> 40:51.044
how a missing girl from
Pennsylvania wound up

40:51.079 --> 40:53.665
a human weapon covered in
confidential information.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.841
- I mean, it's worthless.
- Not my problem.

40:55.876 --> 40:57.547
I gave you the file,
that was the deal.

40:57.613 --> 40:58.917
This... is over.

40:58.975 --> 41:01.144
(chuckling)
But, little lady.

41:01.179 --> 41:03.522
But you already
took my money.

41:04.422 --> 41:07.143
You already
sold out your friends.

41:08.099 --> 41:11.177
If I tell the FBI
what you've done...

41:11.232 --> 41:14.797
you won't just get fired,
you'll be indicted.

41:15.636 --> 41:19.739
This is over
when I say it's over.

41:19.987 --> 41:22.735
You're mine now,
Agent Zapata.

41:24.117 --> 41:26.118
