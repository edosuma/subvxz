00:15.882 --> 00:18.680
Ensign Kim,
please try and hold us steady.

00:18.752 --> 00:19.810
This material is extremely

00:19.886 --> 00:20.875
fragile.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.115
Sorry, Doc,
I'm doing the best I can.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.417
Maybe I should've insisted

00:24.491 --> 00:27.949
on a more experienced pilot,
like Mr. Paris.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.959
Oh, I'd give anything
to trade places with him

00:30.063 --> 00:30.961
right now.

00:31.064 --> 00:33.055
Seven, can you join me, please?

00:33.133 --> 00:34.259
On my way.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.265
I don't know

00:35.368 --> 00:36.528
if I can take
three more days

00:36.636 --> 00:37.728
of chasing comets with him.

00:37.837 --> 00:39.361
The time might
pass more easily

00:39.472 --> 00:41.872
if we disable
his vocal processor.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.249
I thought you might
find this interesting.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.180
Pre-animate biomatter.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.817
Look deeper.

01:01.995 --> 01:05.294
An undeveloped nucleus contained
in a cytoplasmic matrix.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.629
And buried deep inside
that nucleus-

01:07.700 --> 01:10.897
primitive strands of DNA.

01:11.037 --> 01:12.902
The beginnings of life, Seven.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.496
What's your point?

01:14.607 --> 01:17.075
When I look at this,
I don't see a mere cell.

01:17.177 --> 01:18.940
I see the potential
for literature

01:19.079 --> 01:20.671
and art, empires

01:20.747 --> 01:21.679
and kingdoms.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.340
Perhaps your visual subroutines

01:23.416 --> 01:24.440
are malfunctioning.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.077
Someday...

01:28.154 --> 01:30.679
this cytoplasmic
matrix may fall

01:30.757 --> 01:33.123
into the primordial sea
of a distant world,

01:33.193 --> 01:35.855
where it could ignite
an evolutionary process.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.056
Eons from now,
a creature not unlike you

01:38.131 --> 01:40.964
could emerge, look
up at the stars

01:41.134 --> 01:43.364
and ask, "Who am I?

01:43.470 --> 01:45.665
How did I come to be?"

01:45.772 --> 01:49.208
It's the miracle of creation,
Seven.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.072
Doesn't that excite you?

01:53.446 --> 01:55.311
Ensign Kim, I asked you
to hold us steady.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.484
We're under attack!

03:52.665 --> 03:54.633
This is the Federation Ship
Delta Flyer.

03:54.734 --> 03:55.962
We're on a peaceful mission.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.297
Hold your fire.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.963
You're transporting
a suspected photonic insurgent

04:00.073 --> 04:01.973
through Lokirrim space.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.599
Drop your shields
and prepare to be boarded.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.702
Photonic insurgent?

04:06.779 --> 04:08.610
I-if you're referring
to the hologram,

04:08.681 --> 04:10.672
he's our Doctor.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.613
Seven, we've lost thrusters.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.279
I'll try reinitializing
the driver coils.

04:16.356 --> 04:18.620
Voyager, this is the Flyer.
Mayday!

04:18.690 --> 04:19.623
Come in.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.023
Subspace communications

04:21.094 --> 04:22.527
are off-line.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.896
It's a tractor beam.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.364
Remodulate our shields.

04:28.468 --> 04:29.628
That should break us free.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.801
Shields are down.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.835
What's happening?

04:39.912 --> 04:42.710
They're using
some kind of disruption field.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.579
It's decompiling your matrix.

04:44.651 --> 04:45.879
Federation vessel.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.283
Power down your systems

04:47.353 --> 04:48.911
and prepare to surrender
the photonic.

04:48.988 --> 04:50.182
Seven, they're pulling us in.

04:50.256 --> 04:52.349
You're going to have to hide
the Doctor's program.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.825
Do something, please.

04:59.165 --> 05:00.189
We don't want to hurt you.

05:00.266 --> 05:01.665
We're here for the insurgent.

05:04.337 --> 05:06.396
Where's the photonic?

05:06.506 --> 05:08.633
You decompiled his matrix.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.140
You murdered him.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.574
Seven?

05:11.644 --> 05:14.374
I'm sorry.
There wasn't enough time.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.141
Biogenic material.

05:19.218 --> 05:21.652
It could be used
to create viral weapons.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.086
Confiscate it.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.748
Our Doctor was using
these spores

05:24.824 --> 05:27.657
to synthesize new
medicines, not weapons.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.092
What's this?

05:31.497 --> 05:34.989
It's my portable
regeneration unit.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.625
I have a unique physiology.

05:36.736 --> 05:37.828
This device

05:37.937 --> 05:40.701
maintains my cybernetic systems.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.035
Have this analyzed.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.166
Yes, sir.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.437
There's no one else aboard.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.944
Take them to detention,

05:47.013 --> 05:49.573
and secure their ship
in the Docking Bay.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.708
You got what you wanted.
Let us go.

05:51.784 --> 05:53.081
Transporting photonics

05:53.152 --> 05:56.610
and manufacturing biogenic
weapons are serious charges.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.987
Let's go.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.826
I want to talk
to your superior!

06:16.909 --> 06:17.876
Careful, Ensign,

06:17.944 --> 06:19.707
or you'll fracture
a metacarpal.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.804
That'd be the least
of our problems.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.578
The situation is not as
desperate as it appears.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.676
Not as desperate?

06:27.754 --> 06:30.086
We're prisoners
on an alien ship.

06:30.156 --> 06:31.817
Voyager has no idea
we're missing,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.587
and the Doctor's
been decompiled.

06:34.660 --> 06:39.222
The reports of my decompilation
have been greatly exaggerated.

06:42.034 --> 06:43.092
Doc?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.937
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

06:48.007 --> 06:50.168
Seven downloaded my program

06:50.243 --> 06:52.268
into her cybernetic matrix.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.870
An interesting sensation,
to say the least.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.108
And now you're in control
of Seven's body?

06:57.183 --> 06:59.310
Total control, it seems.

06:59.385 --> 07:00.249
What about Seven?

07:00.319 --> 07:01.411
Is she all right?

07:01.487 --> 07:04.012
I scanned her before the aliens
came aboard.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.785
Physiologically, she's fine.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.189
As for her consciousness,

07:07.260 --> 07:08.818
I'm assuming it's submerged,

07:08.895 --> 07:10.556
but there's no way to be sure,

07:10.630 --> 07:13.394
until I vacate her systems
and conduct a neurological exam.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.433
Then we need

07:14.500 --> 07:15.558
the mobile emitter.

07:15.668 --> 07:16.828
This experience will make

07:16.969 --> 07:17.993
a fascinating article

07:18.104 --> 07:20.129
for the Starfleet
Medical Journal.

07:20.239 --> 07:21.399
Ow.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.997
Careful. That's not your body,

07:23.109 --> 07:24.974
remember?

07:25.044 --> 07:27.774
I knew Seven's senses were more
acute than the average humanoid

07:27.847 --> 07:28.814
but...

07:28.881 --> 07:30.872
I had no idea.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.679
What is that?

07:32.752 --> 07:33.810
What?

07:33.886 --> 07:35.376
That smell.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.715
I don't smell anything.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.759
Could be an airborne toxin.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.556
Do you think
they're trying to poison us?

07:50.536 --> 07:52.333
It's you.

07:54.540 --> 07:55.768
It's been a busy day.

07:55.842 --> 07:58.174
I guess I'm
perspiring a little.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.235
A little?

08:01.681 --> 08:04.206
Seven's had a busy day, too,
and she's come through it

08:04.283 --> 08:06.251
smelling like
the proverbial rose.

08:11.424 --> 08:15.827
Captain's Log,
Stardate 54238.3.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.987
We've completed
our maintenance layover

08:18.064 --> 08:19.554
at the Maldorian Station,

08:19.632 --> 08:21.429
and we're on our way
to rendezvous

08:21.501 --> 08:22.627
with the Delta Flyer.

08:22.735 --> 08:25.602
We expect to reach them
in 48 hours.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.037
Headache, fever,

08:28.107 --> 08:31.770
respiratory distress, tremors.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.506
Looks like some kind of virus.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.140
It is not a virus.

08:37.216 --> 08:38.477
You want to tell me

08:38.551 --> 08:39.643
what's going on?

08:39.719 --> 08:41.152
In the Doctor's database,

08:41.220 --> 08:46.123
you'll find a medication
under file Theta-12-Alpha.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.853
Please replicate
it immediately.

08:47.927 --> 08:49.394
You know I can't

08:49.462 --> 08:52.556
give out medicine
without knowing what it's for.

08:52.632 --> 08:54.395
If you must know,

08:54.467 --> 08:58.563
I am suffering
from a neurochemical imbalance.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.639
An "imbalance"?

09:00.740 --> 09:03.004
It is native to my species.

09:03.075 --> 09:06.442
Oh... this wouldn't be
the kind of imbalance

09:06.512 --> 09:09.675
that comes around
once every seven years?

09:11.884 --> 09:15.115
My Pon farr is
in the early stages.

09:15.187 --> 09:18.247
The urges are
still controllable.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.588
You never fail
to amaze me, Tuvok.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.560
A man of your advanced years

09:22.628 --> 09:25.062
still driven
by the mating instinct?

09:25.131 --> 09:30.763
Unlike in humans, the Vulcan
libido increases with time.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.202
Well, I guess there has to be
some kind of reward

09:33.272 --> 09:34.762
for all that Vulcan discipline.

09:34.874 --> 09:39.106
The Doctor anticipated my needs
and developed a treatment.

09:39.178 --> 09:40.873
Combined with meditation,

09:41.013 --> 09:44.073
it will enable me
to control the symptoms.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.084
Well, if that doesn't work,

09:46.152 --> 09:47.813
there's always
a cold sonic shower.

09:47.887 --> 09:50.549
I'll tell the Captain
that you'll be out of commission

09:50.623 --> 09:51.885
for a couple of days.

09:51.958 --> 09:55.257
She will want to know why.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.897
Well, according to my tricorder,

09:58.965 --> 10:00.091
all we've got here

10:00.166 --> 10:03.567
is a mild case of
the Tarkalean flu.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.968
Thank you, Lieutenant.

10:14.847 --> 10:18.783
Mmm! I had no idea
that eating was such a...

10:18.851 --> 10:19.943
sensual experience.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.953
The tastes, the textures,

10:22.021 --> 10:24.785
feeling it slide down
Seven's esophagus.

10:24.857 --> 10:25.949
It's... it's exquisite!

10:26.025 --> 10:27.959
They're prison rations.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.961
My uniform
probably tastes better.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.563
You know,
I was thinking.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.929
When we get back to Voyager,
perhaps you and Seven

10:34.033 --> 10:36.001
could help me modify
my physical parameters.

10:36.135 --> 10:36.965
Why?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.330
So I can eat, of course,

10:38.437 --> 10:39.870
like any other member
of the crew.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.406
There's just
one small problem-

10:41.474 --> 10:42.668
you don't have a stomach.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.175
Where is the food
gonna go?

10:44.243 --> 10:46.711
I believe we can construct
a holographic stomach.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.213
It can store the food
for eventual recycling.

10:49.281 --> 10:52.341
Eh... maybe we should focus
on something more productive,

10:52.418 --> 10:53.817
like getting out of here.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.979
Relax, Ensign.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.751
Our shipmates have never
let us down before.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.689
I'm sure the Captain
will clear up

11:00.760 --> 11:02.728
this little
misunderstanding.

11:02.795 --> 11:06.253
In the meantime,
are you going to finish that?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.262
You!

11:12.371 --> 11:14.305
Come with us.

11:14.373 --> 11:15.465
I'm the senior officer.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.439
If you're going
to take someone, take me.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.102
My orders were specific.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.611
Don't worry, Ensign.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.807
I can take care of myself.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.319
Mmm. My compliments
to the chef.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.002
The prisoner, sir.

11:44.070 --> 11:49.201
Pulse-phased weapons,
duranium-enforced hull. Hmm.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.369
Much more sophisticated than
the typical smuggler's vessel.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.005
How many ways do you
want me to say this?

11:55.114 --> 11:57.878
We are not smugglers
or terrorists.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.383
We are explorers.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.942
Let us contact our ship.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.816
Our Captain will
explain everything.

12:02.855 --> 12:05.221
If you're innocent,
then you won't mind

12:05.291 --> 12:07.350
telling me more
about this vessel.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.830
For instance, um...
this device.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.092
What does it do?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.396
That's a standard
food replicator.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.470
Can it be used to
create bioweapons?

12:18.537 --> 12:23.372
Not unless you count
Mr. Neelix's Bolian soufflé.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.171
Let me show you.

12:25.244 --> 12:29.305
Computer, one slice
of New York cheesecake.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.281
This is an old Earth delicacy.

12:34.353 --> 12:37.117
How do I know you're not trying
to poison me?

12:37.189 --> 12:40.556
Oh, please.

12:44.697 --> 12:47.131
Mmm...

12:48.467 --> 12:50.697
Mmm!

12:50.803 --> 12:52.293
Oh...

12:52.404 --> 12:55.202
Oh, I never imagined... Mmm!

12:55.274 --> 12:57.003
Is this the first time
you've tried that?

12:58.677 --> 13:02.545
Of course not,
but it's just that I usually...

13:02.615 --> 13:06.881
avoid foods
that are this... rich.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.613
I do have a figure to maintain.

13:08.687 --> 13:11.212
Oh, I better get
another for you.

13:11.290 --> 13:15.590
Uh, computer, another
slice of cheesecake.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.431
Uh... here.

13:27.673 --> 13:30.437
Mmm.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.672
What other foods
can that device create?

13:35.347 --> 13:37.577
Hmm...

13:41.687 --> 13:45.054
Oh... during my time
with the collective,

13:45.124 --> 13:47.752
we assimilated
thousands of cultures

13:47.827 --> 13:50.762
from one end of the galaxy
to the other.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.664
I'll say this for the Borg,
we certainly do travel.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.560
Oh, of course, my life
didn't truly begin

13:58.671 --> 14:00.662
until I came aboard Voyager

14:00.773 --> 14:04.539
and met the person who...
who changed my life,

14:04.610 --> 14:07.704
the only one who
truly believed in me,

14:07.780 --> 14:09.543
saw my true potential...

14:09.615 --> 14:10.877
Your Captain?

14:10.950 --> 14:12.884
Our Doctor.

14:12.952 --> 14:16.547
That's right, the "photonic. "

14:16.622 --> 14:19.420
If only you could
have known him.

14:19.491 --> 14:24.451
Ruggedly handsome, a sharp wit,
a towering intellect...

14:24.530 --> 14:28.261
If he and I hadn't been
colleagues, well...

14:28.334 --> 14:30.302
Now we'll never know

14:30.369 --> 14:32.837
what heights
he could have reached.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.338
I hope you understand,
I had no choice.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.136
"I was just following orders. "

14:37.209 --> 14:38.471
I've heard that before.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.445
Maybe there's something
I could do for you.

14:41.513 --> 14:43.640
Uh, I-I'll speak
to my superiors-

14:43.716 --> 14:44.876
ask for leniency.

14:44.950 --> 14:48.681
Hmm. If I survive that long.

14:48.754 --> 14:49.948
What do you mean?

14:50.022 --> 14:53.685
My cybernetic components
are already depolarizing.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.694
I need my regener...
regeneration device.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.389
As you can see,

14:58.464 --> 15:02.457
my motor functions
are already impaired.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.494
Right.

15:05.604 --> 15:10.371
If I give this... back to you,

15:10.442 --> 15:12.842
will you do something for me?

15:17.116 --> 15:19.880
It was so nice of you
to escort me.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.546
Ah, nice to see you, Ensign.

15:22.621 --> 15:23.883
Are you drunk?

15:23.956 --> 15:25.048
It wasn't my fault.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.149
Seven's unique
physiology is... unique.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.057
It doesn't react well
to synthehol.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.618
What happened?

15:30.696 --> 15:32.789
Captain Ranek and I shared
a meal aboard the Flyer.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.992
He's really a gentleman
once you get to know him.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.728
You had a dinner date
in Seven's body?

15:36.835 --> 15:38.063
It wasn't a "date. "

15:38.170 --> 15:39.899
It was a tactical maneuver,

15:40.005 --> 15:42.565
designed to win the trust
of our captors,

15:42.675 --> 15:45.109
and it worked.

15:45.177 --> 15:46.610
I won't ask what you
had to do to get this.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.476
Nothing unladylike,
I assure you.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.913
They lost their medic
in a recent skirmish,

15:50.983 --> 15:52.746
and I offered
to take his place.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.217
Let's download your program

15:54.286 --> 15:55.947
before they change their mind.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.984
Hey, careful where you point
those tubules.

16:02.094 --> 16:04.426
Sorry.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.196
Easy.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.829
How do you feel?

16:14.940 --> 16:17.534
I'm impaired.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.167
You've had quite a shock
to your system.

16:19.244 --> 16:20.472
Let me explain what's happened.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.207
I know exactly
what's happened.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.146
You've been abusing my body.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.354
-I'm a doctor!
-Shh!

16:32.424 --> 16:34.892
I would never
abuse your body.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.258
I was trying to
get information.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.854
Sometimes a, a glass
of wine can...

16:39.932 --> 16:41.160
loosen the tongue.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.427
One glass.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.434
That doesn't excuse
the other eight.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.595
Was it that many?

16:46.772 --> 16:48.262
Seven, you were aware

16:48.374 --> 16:49.773
of everything?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.104
Painfully.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.575
I'm afraid the role

16:52.644 --> 16:55.204
of "spy" wasn't written
into my program.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.111
I was forced to...
improvise.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.777
You "improvised" your way
through an entire cheesecake,

17:00.853 --> 17:04.448
as well as three servings
of Ktarian chocolate puffs.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.083
Now I have to suffer
the consequences.

17:07.159 --> 17:09.719
I apologize if I...
overindulged.

17:09.795 --> 17:12.229
I'll be more careful next time.

17:12.297 --> 17:13.820
There won't be a next time.

17:13.965 --> 17:15.228
I'll be discovered.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.824
They'll decompile my program.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.664
Shh!

17:21.973 --> 17:23.737
I know this is
difficult for you,

17:23.809 --> 17:26.039
but you're going to
have put up with it,

17:26.111 --> 17:27.874
until we can get
out of here.

17:28.012 --> 17:29.878
How do you propose
we do that?

17:29.948 --> 17:32.542
Maybe you can tap
into their com system,

17:32.618 --> 17:33.880
get a message to Voyager.

17:34.019 --> 17:36.886
Deciphering alien computers
isn't exactly my forte.

17:36.955 --> 17:38.013
But it is one of mine.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.421
If you can get close enough

17:39.491 --> 17:41.322
while they're accessing
their systems,

17:41.393 --> 17:43.384
I'll be able to observe
their command protocols.

17:43.462 --> 17:44.793
What's the situation?

17:44.863 --> 17:45.830
The Captain wants
the female

17:45.898 --> 17:47.559
prisoner in
the Medical Bay.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.828
We should proceed.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.305
You're saving my life.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.842
I want you to know
how grateful I am.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.410
Try to remember that

17:59.478 --> 18:02.743
the next time you're tempted
to overindulge.

18:15.994 --> 18:19.122
Photonics' viral weapon
attacks the cerebral cortex.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.132
Within days,
the victims suffer

18:21.200 --> 18:22.724
complete synaptic failure.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.564
Well, if we can't stop
the virus,

18:24.670 --> 18:26.661
we may be able to slow
its progress.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.138
We need to synthesize
a neural inhibitor.

18:32.644 --> 18:35.579
Forgive me, but aren't you
the ship's Tactical Officer?

18:35.647 --> 18:38.115
Tactical Officer,
Medic, Engineer.

18:38.183 --> 18:41.084
We've lost nearly a third
of our crew to the photonics.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.621
Well, you certainly know
your way around a medical bay.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.214
You may have missed
your true calling.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.759
Actually, Emmik always thought
I'd become a teacher.

18:48.827 --> 18:50.818
He used to call me
"the little professor. "

18:50.896 --> 18:52.557
Who's Emmik?

18:52.631 --> 18:55.395
The photonic who helped
raise my brother and me.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.265
He knew more about treating
scrapes and bruises

18:58.370 --> 19:00.338
than any organic doctor
I ever met.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.430
Sounds like someone
I'd enjoy meeting.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.135
Maybe...
before he joined the insurgency.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.337
Why did he do that?

19:07.412 --> 19:10.643
I ask myself that question
every day.

19:10.716 --> 19:14.652
We never treated him
like a servant,

19:14.720 --> 19:16.551
but he turned against us anyway.

19:16.622 --> 19:24.028
Is it... possible he felt...
subjugated?

19:24.096 --> 19:25.825
I don't see how.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.526
He lived his own life,
pursued his own interests.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.068
He was part of our family.

19:31.136 --> 19:34.071
At least I thought he was.

19:34.139 --> 19:36.767
We should get back
to the patient.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.880
It could take up
to a day to determine

19:44.016 --> 19:45.483
if the inhibitor
is working.

19:45.551 --> 19:46.882
Thank you.

19:46.985 --> 19:49.419
Don't thank me.
Thank my ship's doctor.

19:49.488 --> 19:52.389
He taught me everything
I know about medicine

19:52.457 --> 19:53.446
and remember-

19:53.525 --> 19:54.822
he was a photonic.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.417
Actually, you have a lot

19:56.495 --> 19:57.689
in common with him.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.755
He was something
of a jack-of-all-trades, too.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.493
I suspect you'd
have gotten along

20:02.601 --> 20:04.091
famously.

20:04.203 --> 20:08.037
I'm certain he would've taken
a liking to you.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.287
Your neurotransmitters

20:22.354 --> 20:23.685
aren't absorbing
the medication.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.382
Can you increase
the dosage?

20:25.457 --> 20:27.823
Not without causing damage
to your neocortex.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.292
The Doc might be able
to synthesize

20:29.361 --> 20:30.350
a stronger medicine, but...

20:30.429 --> 20:31.623
I'll make the best

20:31.697 --> 20:34.063
of the situation
until he returns.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.507
I do have one area
of expertise

20:43.575 --> 20:44.906
that might help-

20:44.977 --> 20:47.605
the holodeck.

20:47.679 --> 20:50.341
I am a married man.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.508
Look, it's the
holodeck, Tuvok;

20:52.584 --> 20:54.108
it doesn't count.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.552
Is that what you tell
your wife?

20:56.622 --> 20:59.022
No, of course not.

20:59.157 --> 21:01.148
My days of rescuing
slave girls

21:01.260 --> 21:03.125
from Planet 10 are history.

21:03.161 --> 21:06.892
Look, you have photographs
of your wife, right?

21:07.032 --> 21:08.795
Well, the computer
can use them

21:08.867 --> 21:10.027
to create a replica.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.898
It wouldn't be
breaking your vows

21:12.037 --> 21:13.937
if it's a hologram
of your wife.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.609
As it was in the dawn
of our days,

21:22.681 --> 21:25.479
as it will be
for all tomorrows,

21:25.550 --> 21:28.815
to you, my husband, I
consecrate all that I am.

21:28.887 --> 21:29.945
T'Pel, my wife,

21:30.088 --> 21:32.852
from you I receive
all that I am.

21:32.924 --> 21:36.883
As it was in the beginning,
so shall it be now.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.090
Two bodies; one mind.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.768
I'm picking up a vessel
closing at high impulse.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.103
They're firing.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.972
Shields are holding.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.011
Open a channel.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.545
This is Captain
Kathryn Janeway

21:55.614 --> 21:57.809
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.714
We're on a peaceful mission.

21:59.785 --> 22:01.412
We've detected photonic activity
aboard your vessel.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.078
Drop your shields and prepare
to be boarded.

22:03.121 --> 22:05.248
Photonic activity?

22:05.324 --> 22:08.191
Tuvok- he's in Holodeck 2.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.420
They're firing again.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.435
It's some kind
of photonic disrupter

22:17.502 --> 22:18.901
directed at Holodeck 2.

22:18.970 --> 22:22.565
Target their weapons array
and fire.

22:27.412 --> 22:28.344
They're hailing.

22:28.413 --> 22:30.108
On screen.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.082
Drop your shields and prepare
to receive our inspection teams.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.812
You're not in a position
to be making demands.

22:34.886 --> 22:36.251
Why did you fire on us?

22:36.321 --> 22:38.482
Your vessel is carrying
photonics

22:38.557 --> 22:39.819
through Lokirrim space.

22:39.891 --> 22:42.325
We didn't realize
that was forbidden.

22:42.394 --> 22:45.591
We'd be happy
to shut down our holodecks.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.169
Your sensors should confirm
they've been deactivated.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.937
You're still required
to submit to inspection.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.773
Your sensors should also confirm

23:00.879 --> 23:02.813
that our weapons
are ready to fire.

23:02.848 --> 23:05.214
We're both reasonable people.

23:05.283 --> 23:06.682
I suggest a compromise.

23:06.752 --> 23:10.119
Your vessel will escort us
through Lokirrim territory.

23:10.188 --> 23:12.315
That way,
you can keep an eye on us,

23:12.391 --> 23:15.121
make sure we don't reactivate
our holodecks.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.888
The other alternative is...

23:16.962 --> 23:19.260
we destroy your ship.

23:22.601 --> 23:24.899
Your proposal is acceptable.

23:28.173 --> 23:31.404
Sometimes diplomacy requires
a little saber rattling.

23:31.476 --> 23:35.173
Begin long-range scans.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.647
I can picture them now-

23:40.719 --> 23:42.949
my father in
his airponics bay

23:43.054 --> 23:44.885
pruning his cona vines,

23:44.956 --> 23:48.050
my mother reading
in her favorite chair.

23:48.126 --> 23:50.788
Nothing in that home
ever changes.

23:50.862 --> 23:53.194
It must be comforting
to have a place like that

23:53.265 --> 23:54.698
to go back to.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.825
I've never been away
this long before.

23:58.403 --> 24:00.871
His progress is remarkable.

24:00.972 --> 24:04.271
I want you to know,
I'm going to tell my superiors

24:04.342 --> 24:06.207
everything
you've done for us.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.075
First Ranek and now you.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.444
I may become
the first prisoner of war

24:10.515 --> 24:12.449
to be decorated by his captors.

24:12.517 --> 24:17.216
I know someone
who'd really enjoy meeting you.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.519
Who?

24:19.591 --> 24:23.322
My brother, Lohden.

24:23.395 --> 24:24.692
Your brother?

24:24.763 --> 24:26.560
You'd like him.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.394
He's ambitious, accomplished,

24:28.467 --> 24:30.662
and he'd love
your sense of humor.

24:30.769 --> 24:33.203
Hmm. Apparently, it's my

24:33.271 --> 24:35.205
most attractive quality.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.207
Seven of Nine.

24:37.275 --> 24:39.869
Please report to the Bridge.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.954
Let me guess- your crew
decided to abandon ship.

24:55.093 --> 24:57.357
I wanted to thank you.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.454
I had a wonderful time
the other night.

24:59.531 --> 25:02.591
It's not often that I...

25:02.701 --> 25:04.669
indulge myself like that.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.432
It's been a long time
for me, too.

25:06.538 --> 25:09.439
I remembered your interest
in stellar phenomenon,

25:09.508 --> 25:11.339
so I requested
a course change

25:11.409 --> 25:13.138
to show you something.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.785
What is it?

25:25.857 --> 25:29.520
To an astronomer,
it's simply a pulsar cluster,

25:29.594 --> 25:32.188
but our poets call it
the "Window of Dreams. "

25:32.264 --> 25:35.563
You could travel from one end
of the Quadrant to the other

25:35.634 --> 25:36.862
and never see anything like it.

25:36.968 --> 25:39.835
Lovely! Hmm.

25:44.109 --> 25:45.838
It's the pulsar's
EM fields

25:45.911 --> 25:47.606
vibrating against
our hull.

25:47.679 --> 25:49.044
Huh.

25:49.114 --> 25:52.106
I once thought this was
the most beautiful sight

25:52.183 --> 25:53.241
in the sector.

25:53.318 --> 25:54.444
Hmm.

25:54.519 --> 25:56.987
I see now that I was wrong.

25:58.924 --> 26:00.084
Hmm.

26:00.191 --> 26:02.159
Oh. I almost forgot.

26:02.193 --> 26:05.492
Oh, I promised a friend
I'd go easy on the synthehol.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.929
Do you hear that?

26:09.034 --> 26:11.161
It's identical to the rhythm
produced

26:11.269 --> 26:13.396
by the eight-chambered
Ktarian heart.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.029
Hmm.

26:20.145 --> 26:21.442
Is something wrong?

26:23.114 --> 26:24.638
Rapid pulse,
respiratory distress.

26:24.716 --> 26:27.310
You may be having a reaction
to the pulsar's radiation.

26:27.385 --> 26:30.115
We should get you
to the Medical Bay.

26:30.188 --> 26:32.452
No, I'm not going
to the Medical Bay.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.082
You starship Captains
are all alike.

26:34.159 --> 26:36.320
You can stare down the barrel
of a phaser cannon,

26:36.394 --> 26:38.385
but you can't stomach
a simple medical exam.

26:38.463 --> 26:41.489
I don't need an exam to know
what I'm suffering from.

26:46.805 --> 26:47.829
I'm sorry. I thought...

26:47.939 --> 26:48.906
You were wrong.

26:48.974 --> 26:50.236
I didn't mean to offend you.

26:50.308 --> 26:51.240
It's just...

26:51.309 --> 26:52.901
I've never met a woman
like you before.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.378
That's because there are
no women like me.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.784
Is something wrong?

27:10.862 --> 27:12.352
Ranek summoned me
to the Bridge

27:12.430 --> 27:15.126
under the pretext
of a little stargazing.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.464
What he really wanted
was to use my face

27:17.569 --> 27:18.627
as a tongue depressor.

27:18.737 --> 27:20.204
I'm surprised
to hear that.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.795
It was completely inappropriate!

27:21.906 --> 27:23.396
That kind of behavior

27:23.508 --> 27:26.238
would get a Starfleet Captain
reassigned to a garbage scow.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.972
I'm not defending
what he did, but...

27:28.046 --> 27:29.013
you have to understand

27:29.080 --> 27:30.707
we've been out here
for a long time.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.875
It's difficult to
hide your feelings,

27:32.984 --> 27:34.451
especially when
you work closely

27:34.519 --> 27:37.181
with someone you're
attracted to.

27:37.255 --> 27:40.986
You... have feelings for him?

27:43.995 --> 27:45.860
I've known Lotharios
like Ranek.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.023
Trust me, you don't
want anything to do with him.

27:48.099 --> 27:50.226
You need someone who...

27:50.335 --> 27:52.860
who can appreciate
your many talents.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.439
Someone... overflowing

27:55.507 --> 27:58.476
with intelligence
and compassion,

27:58.543 --> 27:59.635
someone capable...

27:59.711 --> 28:00.678
Ow!

28:02.514 --> 28:03.538
Ah!

28:03.615 --> 28:05.173
It looks like a spasm
in the trapezius.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.275
I had no idea
it could be...

28:07.352 --> 28:08.410
so excruciating.

28:08.486 --> 28:09.418
That's what happens

28:09.487 --> 28:11.079
when you work so long
without rest.

28:11.156 --> 28:12.214
Ah!

28:12.290 --> 28:13.222
Our last medic

28:13.291 --> 28:14.519
showed me a technique
that might help.

28:14.592 --> 28:15.524
I-I'll try it,
if you like.

28:15.593 --> 28:16.855
Please, anything!

28:18.563 --> 28:20.690
Oh, that...

28:20.765 --> 28:24.360
that feels... wonderful.

28:24.469 --> 28:25.936
Oh...

28:33.111 --> 28:34.442
Did I hurt you?

28:34.512 --> 28:35.877
No, no-no, no, no, no.

28:36.014 --> 28:37.072
Well, then what's wrong?

28:39.751 --> 28:42.219
There's something
you don't know about me,

28:42.287 --> 28:44.983
something I have to tell you.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.284
It's all right.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.518
I know.

28:48.593 --> 28:49.821
You do?

28:49.894 --> 28:51.225
How could you?

28:51.296 --> 28:54.788
Your cybernetic implants,
your portable regenerator?

28:54.866 --> 28:57.858
You're not going
to tell anyone, are you?

28:57.936 --> 29:00.598
I would never say anything
to the crew,

29:00.705 --> 29:02.605
but Ranek knows.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.232
He does?

29:04.342 --> 29:06.810
Of course, it was apparent
the moment we scanned you.

29:06.945 --> 29:09.778
I can't believe
you didn't say anything.

29:09.848 --> 29:12.146
It wouldn't have been
appropriate.

29:12.217 --> 29:14.685
You're part Borg.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.812
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.354
Ah. Mmm.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.822
Security to Medical Bay.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.017
This is Lieutenant Jaryn.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.560
The prisoner is ill.

29:23.628 --> 29:25.960
He's requesting treatment
by his crewmate.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.292
Hmm.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.496
Ensign.

29:34.572 --> 29:36.335
Where the hell have you been?

29:36.407 --> 29:37.374
I had to fake a seizure

29:37.475 --> 29:39.204
before the guard would
let me see you.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.209
Calm down.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.973
Seven and I have been
making progress.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.581
Did you get a look

29:50.655 --> 29:52.088
at their computer?

29:52.157 --> 29:53.419
During the one brief moment

29:53.491 --> 29:55.516
when the Doctor wasn't
indulging himself.

29:55.593 --> 29:58.118
I think I've shown
considerable restraint

29:58.196 --> 29:59.288
under the circumstances.

29:59.364 --> 30:00.888
Kissing Ranek on the Bridge?

30:01.032 --> 30:02.693
Is that your idea of restraint?

30:02.801 --> 30:03.768
Kissing?

30:03.868 --> 30:05.301
Not that it's any
of your business,

30:05.370 --> 30:06.735
but if you must know,

30:06.805 --> 30:08.102
Ranek kissed me.

30:08.173 --> 30:10.232
And the massage you got
from Lieutenant Jaryn?

30:10.341 --> 30:11.808
Entirely therapeutic.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.640
You became sexually aroused
in my body.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.174
When did it become a crime
to enjoy a sensation or two?

30:20.251 --> 30:22.776
Of course, you'd be the last
person to understand that.

30:22.854 --> 30:24.082
What do you mean?

30:24.155 --> 30:27.556
The whole world is full
of experiences and sensations,

30:27.625 --> 30:29.752
but you insist
on denying yourself.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.523
Instead of replicating caviar,

30:31.596 --> 30:33.427
you choose
nutritional supplement

30:33.498 --> 30:34.760
13-Alpha.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.959
Caviar is an indulgence.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.795
Indulgences are what
make life worth living!

30:37.902 --> 30:39.699
Shh!

30:39.804 --> 30:42.637
These last few days
have been a revelation.

30:42.707 --> 30:44.834
Feeling your lungs
fill with air,

30:44.909 --> 30:46.934
the surge of adrenaline
through your veins.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.342
Until I spent a day
in your skin,

30:48.413 --> 30:49.812
I never knew what I was missing.

30:49.881 --> 30:52.406
You may have been
better off not knowing.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.314
We're quite a pair.

30:54.385 --> 30:57.149
Me, trapped by the limitations
of photons and force fields.

30:57.222 --> 31:00.419
You, by a drone's obsession
with efficiency.

31:00.491 --> 31:02.618
You'd make an excellent
hologram.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.490
All right!

31:03.561 --> 31:04.755
Listen, you can argue

31:04.829 --> 31:06.694
all you want when we
get back to Voyager,

31:06.764 --> 31:08.254
but that's not going to happen

31:08.333 --> 31:10.062
unless we come up with a plan.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.999
Did you learn anything
about their com system?

31:12.103 --> 31:13.627
It can only be accessed
from the Bridge,

31:13.738 --> 31:15.672
but I saw Ranek
enter his command codes.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.264
If we can get
those codes to Voyager,

31:17.375 --> 31:19.206
they may be able
to disable the shields

31:19.277 --> 31:20.574
and beam us out.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.704
How are we going to do that?

31:24.215 --> 31:26.649
The subspace
transceiver on the Flyer.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.810
Can you get aboard?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.080
It's heavily guarded.

31:29.153 --> 31:32.316
I can get us aboard.

31:37.028 --> 31:40.361
Captain, may I speak with you?

31:40.431 --> 31:41.625
Privately.

31:46.771 --> 31:48.261
I owe you an apology.

31:48.373 --> 31:50.307
Well, I was the one
who acted inappropriately.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.003
Oh, a kiss is hardly
a court-martial offense.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.204
It's just that you...
caught me by surprise.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.214
I-I won't make that
mistake again.

31:57.282 --> 31:59.842
Perhaps, we should...
start over.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.783
What did you have in mind?

32:01.886 --> 32:03.649
Oh, we could start
with a toast.

32:03.688 --> 32:05.155
I thought synth...

32:05.223 --> 32:06.656
Oh, I can make an exception

32:06.724 --> 32:09.750
for a... special occasion.

32:09.827 --> 32:13.024
Computer, champagne,
two glasses.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.370
To new beginnings.

32:24.442 --> 32:28.208
Maybe there's some
hope for us yet.

32:28.279 --> 32:32.739
As I've discovered recently,
anything is possible.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.179
Computer, dim the lights.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.452
Play EMH
Music File

32:41.526 --> 32:43.494
Gamma-12.

32:58.543 --> 32:59.475
Oh...

32:59.544 --> 33:00.636
this is interesting.

33:00.745 --> 33:01.803
It's called a waltz.

33:01.846 --> 33:04.679
Something else I learned
from our Doctor.

33:04.749 --> 33:07.616
Captain Ranek,
please come to the Bridge.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.016
What is it?

33:09.087 --> 33:10.714
We've received
an encrypted transmission.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.278
Oh, I'll be right there.

33:12.357 --> 33:14.882
You're not leaving?

33:14.959 --> 33:17.052
Um...

33:17.128 --> 33:19.756
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.198
I really think
you should stay.

33:31.409 --> 33:34.139
Never play hard to get
with a hologram.

33:40.451 --> 33:42.078
Still no sign

33:42.153 --> 33:43.518
of the Flyer's warp signature.

33:43.588 --> 33:47.524
I appreciate your
sense of duty, Tuvok,

33:47.592 --> 33:50.060
but we can handle the
situation without you.

33:50.128 --> 33:52.494
Under the circumstances,
abandoning my post

33:52.563 --> 33:54.588
would be a dereliction
of duty.

33:54.665 --> 33:57.065
My illness is still
in the early stages.

33:57.168 --> 33:58.635
I can control it.

33:58.703 --> 34:02.332
If I remember correctly,
the last time you came down

34:02.440 --> 34:05.466
with the Tarkalean flu
was seven years ago.

34:05.576 --> 34:06.873
As soon as this is over,

34:06.978 --> 34:08.969
the holodeck
is at your disposal.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.539
There you are, Commander.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.585
Now, a person in
your condition

34:14.652 --> 34:16.313
really ought to be in bed.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.981
This is my
grandmother's recipe,

34:19.056 --> 34:21.889
guaranteed to cure even
the most stubborn flu.

34:22.025 --> 34:23.652
Now... smell that?

34:23.728 --> 34:26.161
I don't smell anything.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.561
Exactly.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.690
I prepared it just
the way you like it.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.167
No herbs or spices
of any kind.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.601
It's practically tasteless.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.806
We're receiving a hail.

34:36.873 --> 34:38.534
It's the Delta Flyer.

34:38.609 --> 34:39.541
On screen.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.407
Seven, it's good to see you.

34:41.478 --> 34:43.947
I'm afraid there's no time
for pleasantries, Captain.

34:44.081 --> 34:46.949
We're being held prisoner
on a Lokirrim patrol ship.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.054
I'm sending you our precise
location and the command codes

34:50.121 --> 34:51.452
to disable their shields.

34:51.522 --> 34:53.284
Are the Doctor and Harry
all right?

34:53.357 --> 34:56.257
Ensign Kim
is his usual chipper self.

34:56.327 --> 34:57.658
As for me, I'm looking forward

34:57.728 --> 34:59.889
to a long, uneventful shift
in Sick Bay.

35:03.935 --> 35:04.993
Doctor?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.230
It's a long story, Captain.

35:07.338 --> 35:08.771
Delta Flyer out.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.535
They may be in more
trouble than we thought.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.836
Set a course.

35:11.909 --> 35:13.103
Our escort isn't

35:13.177 --> 35:14.974
going to take
kindly to a detour.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.638
What's the status
of their weapons?

35:16.714 --> 35:19.182
They've repaired
their forward phasers.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.878
Target their power matrix.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.150
We may only get one shot,
so make it count.

35:26.691 --> 35:27.658
Ready.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.750
Do it.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.263
Direct hit.

35:34.332 --> 35:35.890
Get us out of here,
maximum warp.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.101
What's wrong with him?

35:47.178 --> 35:49.203
Apparently, Captain Ranek

35:49.280 --> 35:51.805
has an even lower tolerance
for synthehol than I do.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.475
That doesn't sound like Ranek.

35:53.551 --> 35:55.849
It's probably not something
he'd admit to his crew.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.445
We should keep this
between us.

36:00.892 --> 36:01.881
What are you doing?

36:01.959 --> 36:03.984
Reviving him.

36:04.061 --> 36:05.119
I-I wouldn't recommend that.

36:09.734 --> 36:11.725
Take her to detention.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.237
Separate her from
the other prisoner.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.399
There are traces of sedative
in your bloodstream.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.368
What was your plan?

36:21.445 --> 36:22.707
To aid the insurgents?

36:22.780 --> 36:24.213
There was no plan.

36:24.282 --> 36:25.340
We trusted you.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.384
I'm still a prisoner
on your ship,

36:27.451 --> 36:28.884
and despite our friendship,

36:29.020 --> 36:30.749
my first obligation
is to escape.

36:30.821 --> 36:32.755
We were going to
recommend leniency.

36:32.823 --> 36:34.017
If you knew who I really was,

36:34.091 --> 36:35.558
I doubt you'd be
trying to help me.

36:35.626 --> 36:39.528
Alien vessel approaching.

36:39.597 --> 36:41.997
I want her where I can see her.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.201
They are raising shields.

36:54.278 --> 36:55.711
Stand by with those
command codes.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.611
Open a channel.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.240
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.716
We don't want a fight.

37:00.818 --> 37:03.082
Return my people and
we'll be on our way.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.678
Your people were caught
transporting

37:04.755 --> 37:07.417
a photonic insurgent
and biogenic material.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.459
We don't want
to disable your ship,

37:09.527 --> 37:11.051
but we will if we have to.

37:17.401 --> 37:19.369
We're losing our
ventral shield grid.

37:19.470 --> 37:20.869
Compensate.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.269
I'm trying.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.672
They've tapped into
the shield matrix.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.040
They're using your
command authorization.

37:31.382 --> 37:32.713
They're rerouting power.

37:32.783 --> 37:34.045
He's tying their shields

37:34.118 --> 37:35.779
directly into
the warp matrix.

37:35.853 --> 37:38.879
If you fire on us,
you'll trigger a core breach.

37:38.956 --> 37:41.049
You'll be killing the people
you're here to rescue.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.559
End transmission.

37:43.628 --> 37:44.856
Tractor beam.

37:46.864 --> 37:47.888
Full reverse!

37:47.965 --> 37:48.954
Target their emitters.

37:54.405 --> 37:55.531
They've broken free.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.039
Chakotay, can you send
a com signal

37:57.108 --> 37:58.507
directly to Seven's
cortical node?

38:02.413 --> 38:06.076
Doctor, if you can hear me,
we need your help.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.311
Try to disable their shields.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.951
It's a photonic.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.821
Cover me.

38:20.931 --> 38:21.829
Stay back!

38:21.932 --> 38:23.126
I'm not afraid to use this.

38:32.810 --> 38:33.970
Step away.

38:35.513 --> 38:36.878
She destabilized
the shield grid.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.039
It's failing.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.113
Watch them.

38:49.527 --> 38:51.358
If you try to
reinitialize the grid,

38:51.429 --> 38:52.396
it'll overload.

38:52.463 --> 38:54.522
We could all die.

38:54.598 --> 38:56.327
Ranek, don't!

39:00.004 --> 39:00.698
Stay back.

39:00.738 --> 39:03.206
I'm a doctor. Let me help.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.242
Their shields are down.
I have a lock.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.538
Away team, stand by
for transport.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.875
I have injured here, Captain.
I can't leave yet.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.506
He'll die

39:13.584 --> 39:14.676
without immediate surgery.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.413
I know this

39:16.487 --> 39:17.613
is difficult to grasp,

39:17.688 --> 39:19.485
but I'm the person
you've been getting to know

39:19.557 --> 39:20.546
the last few days.

39:20.624 --> 39:22.717
My program was in control
of Seven's body.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.021
You're lying.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.620
I know you have feelings
for Ranek.

39:27.698 --> 39:28.687
If he dies,

39:28.766 --> 39:31.394
you're never going
to forgive yourself.

39:38.576 --> 39:40.544
Your vital signs are stable.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.640
Suppose I should
be, uh, grateful.

39:45.716 --> 39:47.274
A "thank you" is customary

39:47.351 --> 39:49.444
after someone saves your life.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.980
What happened was between
me and Seven of Nine,

39:54.058 --> 39:55.252
not you.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.294
I'm sorry you feel that way.

39:57.361 --> 40:00.888
The truth is, aside from
a few awkward moments,

40:00.965 --> 40:04.298
I enjoyed our time together.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.632
There are many women

40:06.737 --> 40:09.262
who'd appreciate an
attractive man like you.

40:09.373 --> 40:12.035
I'm just not one of them.

40:12.109 --> 40:14.373
Um, more of our vessels
are on the way.

40:14.445 --> 40:17.642
You should leave
while you can.

40:17.715 --> 40:19.376
Thank you.

40:24.221 --> 40:25.916
I guess you won't
be introducing me

40:25.990 --> 40:27.150
to your brother.

40:27.224 --> 40:29.954
I'm not sure you're
the kind of person

40:30.094 --> 40:31.356
he's interested in.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.829
You mean because
I'm a hologram.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.700
I don't imagine this experience

40:37.802 --> 40:42.102
is going to change
your feelings about photonics.

40:42.173 --> 40:46.132
But I wanted you to know...

40:46.243 --> 40:48.837
I'm grateful for the time
we've spent together.

40:48.913 --> 40:51.006
You're a talented doctor.

40:51.115 --> 40:53.777
We're the ones
who should be grateful.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.546
I'm glad I could help.

40:57.321 --> 40:59.289
Doctor to Voyager.

40:59.356 --> 41:00.618
One to beam out.

41:10.434 --> 41:11.731
Commander...

41:11.836 --> 41:14.066
it's good to see
you're over the flu.

41:14.171 --> 41:15.195
I have fully recovered.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.637
Thank you for
your assistance.

41:16.707 --> 41:17.639
Oh, don't mention it.

41:17.708 --> 41:19.175
I just hope
everything was okay.

41:19.276 --> 41:20.743
Not exactly.

41:20.845 --> 41:23.575
My wife's ears are four
millimeters shorter

41:23.647 --> 41:24.909
than your facsimile's.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.950
So I took a little
artistic license.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.383
Aside from that,
was everything all right?

41:29.453 --> 41:32.445
The hologram was adequate,

41:32.523 --> 41:35.720
but no substitute for my wife.

41:35.793 --> 41:38.785
Of course not.

41:49.373 --> 41:52.001
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

41:52.142 --> 41:54.440
There isn't one... yet.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.538
The Mess Hall
is three decks up.

41:57.615 --> 41:58.980
In case you've forgotten,

41:59.049 --> 42:01.415
I've lost my appetite...
permanently.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.146
That doesn't mean
you're incapable

42:03.187 --> 42:04.484
of enjoying a meal.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.857
Foie gras with truffles,

42:09.927 --> 42:11.485
an ancient Earth delicacy.

42:11.562 --> 42:13.154
Chateau d'Yquem.

42:13.230 --> 42:14.993
According to
the culinary database,

42:15.065 --> 42:17.260
the ideal accompaniment.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.199
Not your usual fare.

42:19.303 --> 42:21.134
It's come to my attention

42:21.205 --> 42:24.800
that nutritional supplements
don't fully meet my needs.

42:24.909 --> 42:27.309
I see.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.040
I thought we could share
this experience.

42:30.114 --> 42:31.843
I'll describe the meal to you...

42:31.916 --> 42:34.714
the tastes, the sensations.

42:34.785 --> 42:37.151
Perhaps you can enjoy it
vicariously.

42:38.322 --> 42:39.812
What about the wine?

42:39.890 --> 42:42.950
It doesn't exactly agree
with you.

42:43.027 --> 42:46.258
If I become sick,
I won't have far to go.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.828
To shared experiences.

42:52.937 --> 42:54.461
Hear, hear.
