01:08.768 --> 01:10.135
Hi. Did you miss me?

01:10.137 --> 01:12.104
No. Not at all.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.705
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.707
It's okay. You won't lose any
            data.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.509
It's on somebody's cloud.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.777
Oh my god.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.579
Ah, control click the package.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.514
The collections were tragic.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.549
 We can only hope our customers

01:23.551 --> 01:26.018
    are as color-blind as
        our designers.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.386
It's hidden in the installer.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.454
Hold on. That's my sitter, Jill.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.154
Ya.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.190
Hi Jill! How's Laila?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.058
She didn't bite anyone did she?

01:33.060 --> 01:34.359
    Uh-uh-hold on, this is
      my-my-assistant.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.260
        Oh my God yeah.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.662
The models were fat.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.697
They said they were healthy, but
        they were fat.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.499
Uh...you control click it.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.201
 It's the key that says CTRL.
         It's on the-

01:42.203 --> 01:45.504
Oh my God! That is
         disgusting!

01:45.506 --> 01:47.172
A package is actually a folder.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.641
Yeah, they do that to
      make it simple...

01:49.643 --> 01:51.376
but it's always hard to explain
             it.

01:51.378 --> 01:55.214
Oh my God. That is so cute. I
       can't stand it.

01:55.216 --> 01:59.618
- Wait a minute. Oh no.
- Are you brushing your teeth!?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.153
Do not say that
            again!

02:01.155 --> 02:07.893
Hold on Luis, that's my sitter
 again. Hey, Jill what's up?

02:08.495 --> 02:10.329
Well, the
  installer image is inside.

02:10.330 --> 02:14.666
About 8 giga-

02:14.668 --> 02:15.834
- Okay. I can hear you.
- Sorry.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.136
Hi.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.604
Wait, wait, wait. It's not on
          the cloud?

02:18.606 --> 02:23.642
Oh boy. Okay, you need
     to back it up first.
You know I told
             you-

02:23.644 --> 02:27.446
and I don't really want to
   talk about it...again.
Probably take three or
        four hours...

02:27.448 --> 02:32.084
    you know...and...yeah,
        uh, do that--

02:32.086 --> 02:34.086
I know she does. I know...

02:34.088 --> 02:37.322
    but I'm a mom and moms
           worry...

02:37.324 --> 02:42.895
...ugh, nothing. I'll see you in
            a bit.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.880
How was fashion week?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.682
Good.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.819
Good.

03:19.199 --> 03:27.839
- Hiiii! Hi, Laila! Ohhhhhh.
- You're so excited to see Mommy!

03:27.841 --> 03:31.210
Oh, ho, ho! You missed
         Mommy, huh?

03:31.212 --> 03:34.846
Oh, Caramel kisses,
    gimme caramel kisses!

03:37.418 --> 03:40.219
Oh, poor girl. I missed you too.

03:40.221 --> 03:43.589
Ah. We went to the park and the
  post office, the movies--

03:43.591 --> 03:44.756
The movies?

03:44.758 --> 03:47.893
It's freezing in there. Did you
     put her sweater on?

03:47.895 --> 03:50.696
Yes, but she didn't like
          it so I--

03:50.698 --> 03:52.898
Jill. She needs her
           sweater.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.666
Isn't that what her fur is for?

03:54.668 --> 03:56.268
Uhhh, Here ya go.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.270
You know, it feels weird taking
         money for...

03:58.272 --> 03:59.738
   hanging out with my BFF,
          maybe...

03:59.740 --> 04:02.975
    I could just stay for
        dinner... or?

04:03.676 --> 04:04.610
Uh...

04:04.612 --> 04:06.912
Uh, Abby has a client dinner.

04:06.914 --> 04:11.183
Oh. 'Kay.

04:11.185 --> 04:14.586
I will see you tomorrow night.
         Bye Littles.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.887
Her name is Laila.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.423
She looks more like a Littles.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.628
How long you been driving on
         that spare?

04:22.630 --> 04:25.530
About a month. Bye!

04:26.566 --> 04:28.467
House number two is a fixer
 upper just outside the city.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.901
Oh, that place is disgusting.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.236
Is that mold?

04:31.238 --> 04:32.971
It's gotta be.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.540
They're never gonna pick house
             two.

04:35.542 --> 04:36.842
Mmm.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.911
Terrible location.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.382
Hey, Kat. What's up?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.417
You guys want to grab
     a bite at Julio's?

04:45.419 --> 04:47.452
    Two for one margaritas!

04:47.454 --> 04:49.454
They don't allow dogs.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.323
Okay. How about
       Chutney Palace?

04:52.326 --> 04:54.259
Laila doesn't like Indian.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.661
I think we're just  gonna stay
             in.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.561
Bye, bitch!

04:56.563 --> 04:58.764
Bye, bitch!

05:01.734 --> 05:03.602
     Oh, I want that house.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.850
You're squishing Laila.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.919
Sorry.

05:22.855 --> 05:27.392
Don't! She's tired.

05:27.394 --> 05:29.795
Sorry.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.639
Make some noise for fuck's sake!

05:51.017 --> 05:53.952
Kent.

06:01.627 --> 06:05.030
I love you so much.

06:09.736 --> 06:12.671
So you're cool with
        being friends?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.440
Wh--?

06:15.442 --> 06:16.808
Wait. You're still breaking up
           with me?

06:16.810 --> 06:22.981
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. We were
never officially together, so.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.716
   And I mean if you think
          about it..

06:24.718 --> 06:27.085
It's a good thing we didn't get
    too involved you know?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.553
    Woulda been much harder.

06:28.555 --> 06:32.557
But, you're on the lease.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.893
I got a new lease.

06:34.895 --> 06:41.032
Awww. You love these NON-GMO
  biscuits. Yeah. Good Girl.

06:41.034 --> 06:45.971
Give mama your face
and wipe your mouffy. Good girl.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.672
What are my girls up to today?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.541
We're hittin' the
         doggy park.

06:49.543 --> 06:53.879
    We're gonna see Bernie
the pug, and Oliver the Westie,

06:53.881 --> 06:56.715
and Sage the Beagle, and their
           mommies.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.618
You two. Need to make a baby.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.487
We're not ready
          for that.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.589
Bye.

07:18.805 --> 07:22.140
Bob wants to see you in his
           office.

07:40.427 --> 07:44.095
Mhmm

08:00.813 --> 08:03.915
Mhmm.

08:06.053 --> 08:06.952
             I uh--

08:06.954 --> 08:10.622
I got you something.

08:13.092 --> 08:14.793
 It's a USB coffee mug warmer.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.462
You plug it into your USB port
           and it--

08:17.464 --> 08:18.797
keeps it warm

08:18.799 --> 08:20.632
Oh.

08:20.634 --> 08:26.471
Mmmm, mmm, mmm.

08:27.874 --> 08:32.544
Listen, Jill. Ahhh, it's been
           great...

08:32.546 --> 08:34.578
  having you with us for the
       last few months.

08:34.581 --> 08:35.881
Thank you so much,

I-I really enjoy working here
     everyone's just so,

08:39.219 --> 08:40.818
so nice.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.154
We're cutting back on our temps.

08:43.155 --> 08:48.560
D-down-sizing, economy and all,
            uh...

08:48.562 --> 08:54.766
 we're gonna have to let you
go. I'm sor-I'm so-I'm sorry.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.604
But, this is where I work.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.606
Well, not anymore.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.131
They really love their dog.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.166
- They love that dog too much.
- Jesus Christ.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.235
Is that thing wearing
           a tutu?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.970
Cute Christmas Card.

09:31.972 --> 09:36.708
Kaaaaaat!!! What's up
           bitch!
What's up
            bitch!

09:36.710 --> 09:39.010
I'm so glad you're here it's a
    snooze fest in there.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.178
Good thing you didn't
       come to Julio's.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.813
     I'm still shit faced.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.982
Do you have any coconut water?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.884
    Who-ooo. love the dress!

09:45.886 --> 09:48.620
Thank you. I made it
out of a pair of Eliott's pants.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.288
What?! If you don't create your
     own clothing line...

09:50.290 --> 09:52.557
  you should be convicted of
   crimes against humanity.

09:52.559 --> 09:57.729
You guys can put your
     shoes in the basket.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.065
I know the rule, Eliott.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.535
Wow. Rambo! What have you been
            doin'?

10:03.537 --> 10:04.736

       husband Eliott.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.609

10:26.326 --> 10:28.660
Ew! I hate Sangria.

10:28.662 --> 10:31.262
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry I'm
            late.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.165
     They had this worker
 appreciation thing for me.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.202
You know, they gave me a plaque
     with my name on it!

10:37.204 --> 10:38.603
Of course Kent wanted to take me
     out to celebrate...

10:38.605 --> 10:40.238

   almost got stepped on.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.777
Oh, my God. Laila. Laila!

10:50.784 --> 10:52.017
Do you wanna hold her?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.852
No.

10:54.788 --> 10:59.024
I-I mean, I better not.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.725
 Do you have to say no babies?

11:00.727 --> 11:01.826
What was that?!

11:03.163 --> 11:05.930
Oh, God. Hurry!

11:05.932 --> 11:08.900

Everyone.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.813
We have an announcement to make.

11:21.815 --> 11:25.083
Some of you know already, but we
  were waiting until it was

11:25.085 --> 11:27.018
confirmed to share the news with
       the rest of you.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.186
You're pregnant!

11:29.056 --> 11:31.289
Congrats!, That's so
          exciting!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.625
Noooo.

11:33.627 --> 11:37.262
  Eliott has been promoted to
      Vice-President...

11:37.264 --> 11:40.398
of Nerd-dom at Marina Tech in-

11:40.400 --> 11:41.933
We're moving to San
          Francisco.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.369
San Franciso!!! WhooHoooo!

11:44.371 --> 11:47.839
Get the fuck out of here
that's great! Congratulations!

11:47.841 --> 11:50.809
San Franciso!!! WhooHoooo!

12:06.192 --> 12:08.893
I got fired today.

12:15.735 --> 12:20.839
  I got fired today. I can't
    believe I got fired.

12:20.841 --> 12:24.743
   They kept Ephraim and he
    misfiles everything.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.312
  He filed Watermaker before
         Wasserstein.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.814
He's always late to work and he
takes two hour lunch breaks and

12:29.816 --> 12:31.182
   the only reason he works
         so quickly

12:31.184 --> 12:34.385
 is because he's hopped up on
            meth.

12:34.387 --> 12:38.289
They fired the girl who never
     forgets a birthday.

12:38.291 --> 12:44.729
Who works overtime for free! Who
   hand painted one hundred

12:44.731 --> 12:48.967
 "I heart my co-worker" coffee
  mugs for Valentines day.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.903
 And now my BFF is moving away!

12:51.905 --> 12:58.009
   It's not fair. It's not
          faaaaair!

12:58.011 --> 12:59.077
Bye, bitch.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.814
Bye, bitch. I'm drunk.

13:02.816 --> 13:03.948
Bye, Eliott.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.150
Bye.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.452
Byee. Bye pretty boy.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.725
I can't find my other shoe.

13:13.727 --> 13:14.893
Here, I'll help you.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.131
 It just vanished. Just Whoosh!

13:23.403 --> 13:26.004
    It's been such a hard
         couple days.

13:26.006 --> 13:32.811
I...I lost my job and I lost my
boyfriend and I got my period.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.479
Okay. I'll make up the couch.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.181
Come on. Oh!

13:36.183 --> 13:41.786
Ohhh. You guys are so sweet. I'm
    sorry I lost my shoe.

13:41.788 --> 13:48.393
Thank you. I'm just gonna miss
         her so much.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.462
I know.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.832
Would you like to keep her at
 your house until Wednesday?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.033
Yeah, it would really
          help us.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.035
  Uh, we're gonna be moving
and she'll be under our feet--

13:57.037 --> 14:00.438
Are you serious?! I'd love to.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.273
    Well, did you hear that?

14:02.275 --> 14:05.009
    You're comin' to camp
        Jill, Littles.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.511
It's Laila

14:06.513 --> 14:08.079
Mhmm.

14:10.916 --> 14:15.086
Here's her snack bag and her wee
          wee pads.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.789
    Make sure you have her
          blankie.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.557
You have the 24 hour emergency
      vet number, right?

14:19.559 --> 14:20.992
Don't worry.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.329
Everything will be fine, she'll
       be safe with me.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.197
Byeee.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.036
 Call me if you need anything!

14:32.038 --> 14:34.172

14:34.174 --> 14:36.274
Bye!

14:36.276 --> 14:37.075
Bye.

14:37.077 --> 14:42.080

         of you, huh?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.883

14:49.121 --> 14:52.957
  Oh my gosh, you know who's
     engaged this week?

14:52.959 --> 14:56.594
Should I get engaged?

15:02.502 --> 15:05.570
This is called Juicy Glow.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.958
Do you want to stay and watch TV
   with me tonight, Shelby?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.260
No.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.061
Please Shelby?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.263
No!

15:32.265 --> 15:34.032

15:35.868 --> 15:39.037
How much longer do you think?
Because, well, last time you...

15:39.039 --> 15:41.372
didn't leave them in long enough
an-and it didn't really look any

15:41.374 --> 15:45.476
different, and, oh, Kent really
      loves highlights.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.046
Five minutes for you.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.515
       Three for the dog.

15:53.218 --> 15:58.957
Ya know, if you really want 'im
           back...

15:58.959 --> 16:02.727
 you outta let me bleach your
           asshole.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.523
How'd you find me?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.258
Your mom told me.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.662
 You know, she's really upset
 we're not together anymore.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.264
Well, I'm kind of working,
   so... What do you want?

16:40.266 --> 16:42.467
Um, well, you left this in
         my fridge...

16:42.469 --> 16:44.235
   and I thought you might
      miss it 'cause...

16:44.237 --> 16:46.371
 I know you love it an-and I
     don't really eat it,

16:46.373 --> 16:49.974
so...

16:49.976 --> 16:56.481
Well, where's my hot sauce? Been
        missin' that.

16:56.483 --> 17:01.953
Why did you leave me? You never
          said why.

17:01.955 --> 17:04.155
Because you wanted me to stay.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.373
It's 1:30. Where is she?

17:54.740 --> 17:58.076
What's she doing out there?

18:04.651 --> 18:06.017
Jill?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.619
Jill, what's wrong?

18:08.621 --> 18:12.590
Jill, please roll down
         the window.

18:12.592 --> 18:17.195
Jill, roll it down.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.565
Where's Laila? Jill?

18:20.567 --> 18:21.666
Jill, roll your window down!

18:21.668 --> 18:22.567
Jill!

18:22.569 --> 18:26.771
Open the door! Open this door
    and talk to me! Jill!

18:26.773 --> 18:29.373
Where's Laila? Where is Laila?!

18:29.375 --> 18:30.174
Answer her! Jill!

18:30.176 --> 18:31.676
Where-is-Laila?! Jill!

18:31.678 --> 18:35.213
Where's Laila?! Where's Laila?!
Where is Laila?! Where's Laila?!

18:35.215 --> 18:37.482
Where is Laila?! Where is she?!

18:37.484 --> 18:40.118
You let me in this car now!

18:40.120 --> 18:44.455
Where-is-she?! Open
that door! Where's Lai-Laaaa?!

18:44.457 --> 18:47.692
Goooooooone!!!

18:48.628 --> 18:50.428
Abby!

18:50.430 --> 18:52.663
What we have here is a canine
          emergency.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.099
     Get your flyers and
      plaster the area.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.667
Who's got West Valley bike path?

18:56.669 --> 19:00.505
Sir. Yes, Sir!

19:00.507 --> 19:02.240
I need your eyes and ears on me
           people.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.410
Sandwich?

19:06.412 --> 19:07.445
What kind?

19:07.447 --> 19:09.213
It's meat Senorita.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.683
This is a code red.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.784
Ooh, sandwiches.

19:13.786 --> 19:17.788
What time were you at
        the dog park?

19:17.790 --> 19:23.094
Uh, the afternoon, between 12
          and 12:42?

19:23.096 --> 19:25.329
Can you be more specific?!

19:25.331 --> 19:27.832
I told you already. They
  took her at the dog park.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.667
How many more times do I have
         to tell you?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.335
As many times as it takes!

19:31.337 --> 19:33.704
She was kidnapped at Laurel
       Park, Officer.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.340
Has there been a ransom
           demand?

19:36.342 --> 19:42.313
No! He wants to know what the
    kidnapper looked like.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.481
What were you doing when she was
            taken?

19:43.483 --> 19:45.449
I'm speaking. What did he look
            like?

19:45.451 --> 19:46.584
Were you drinking?!

19:46.586 --> 19:50.621
Um-uh-He was-over 6 feet tall,
            uh...

19:50.623 --> 19:55.159
medium toned skin, 30's and uh,
  he had an anchor tattoo...

19:55.161 --> 19:58.829
on his bicep and just beady eyes
       and wild hair...

19:58.831 --> 20:01.399
an-and he was missing his left
            thumb.

20:01.401 --> 20:05.336
I was picking up her doody and I
 looked away for one second.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.470
          One second!

20:06.472 --> 20:09.874
He wants to know what she was
           wearing.

20:09.876 --> 20:13.277
Nothing. Well, it was hot so I
    took off her sweater.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.880
Why do you keep doing that? She
      loves her sweater.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.650
I am so sorry,
     I will do anything.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.485
She wasn't wearing anything,
          Officer.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.855
   The babysitter said she
 was more comfortable naked.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.225
  Please tell me she had her
          collar on.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.393
Well of course she had her
          collar on.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.461
Collar?!

20:30.463 --> 20:34.865
Ma'am are we talking
  about a dog, or a person?

20:34.867 --> 20:37.668
A person! She won't even eat dog
            food.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.737
   Tell me what kind of dog
           that is?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.205
Spoiled.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.541
I think I'm going to be sick.

20:43.543 --> 20:44.909
Oh.

20:49.548 --> 20:53.551
If he wants money...
 why hasn't he contacted us?

20:53.553 --> 20:55.186
He will.

20:55.188 --> 20:59.957
That's him! That's him.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.802
Oh, no. Someone lost Perro
           Perdido.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.638
Ay, Dios mio.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.741
Our dog is missing. Have you
 seen her? Her name's Laila.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.210
Laila?

21:19.212 --> 21:23.781
Honey, Honey, no, no,
 that's not Laila. No. Sorry.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.617
Laila!!! Laila!!!

21:26.619 --> 21:31.422
      Laila! Laila! Laila!

21:31.424 --> 21:36.294
  Laila! Laila! We love you,
        Laila! Laila!

21:39.765 --> 21:41.465
Oh, my God.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.634
Her D'Ugg

21:49.741 --> 21:51.375
      We're losing light.

22:00.886 --> 22:03.020
Awwwww

22:31.417 --> 22:33.784
Get it!

22:34.953 --> 22:40.691
Hello. Yes, it is.

22:40.693 --> 22:44.862
No... I don't want my phone line
       over broadband.

22:44.864 --> 22:45.796
Hang up!

22:45.798 --> 22:47.465
Six months? No commitment?

22:47.467 --> 22:51.902
I don't care! The kidnapper
 might be trying to call us!

23:02.013 --> 23:03.481
I have your dog.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.815
Oh, Jesus.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.617
If you want to get your dog back

23:06.619 --> 23:09.754
do not contact the police, or
        she will die.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.723
Do not contact the FBI...

23:12.725 --> 23:17.828
or she will die. Do not contact
Cesar Milan, or she will die.

23:17.830 --> 23:21.799
Do not think you can outsmart
     me. I have a degree.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.001
Place thirty thousand dollars...

23:24.003 --> 23:26.570
in unmarked bills in a duffle
            bag.

23:26.572 --> 23:30.775
The drop off will be tomorrow
  night,10 pm at the quarry.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.343
Laila.

23:32.345 --> 23:37.348
Do not be late, or she will die.

23:37.350 --> 23:39.583
There's a quarry in LA?

23:39.585 --> 23:40.484
I'm calling the police.

23:40.486 --> 23:45.823
Are you crazy? He'll kill her.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.459
         What do we do?

23:55.368 --> 23:57.401
If you hadn't found Jill on
        Greg's list...

23:57.403 --> 23:59.870
    this never would have
          happened.

23:59.872 --> 24:04.375
She babysat her for a year. It
 coulda happened to anybody!

24:04.377 --> 24:10.448
But it didn't. It happened with
    her and you hired her!

24:10.450 --> 24:15.453
You don't know how that makes me
            feel.

24:15.455 --> 24:18.556
You don't know how I feel.

24:18.558 --> 24:23.160
What?! I'm the one in pain here.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.030
This sucks.

24:26.032 --> 24:29.900
I'm the one in real pain.

24:38.077 --> 24:41.679
It places the lotion in the
           basket.

24:44.416 --> 24:48.018
     No! The lotion goes
        in the basket!

24:49.654 --> 24:52.156
  You spoiled, fucking Bitch.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.472
I can't believe you
       made me drive...

25:08.474 --> 25:11.675
 all the way to Silverlake to
        return a shoe.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.079
What's Jill going to do with one
            shoe?

25:17.782 --> 25:20.150
Hey there she is.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.087
With Laila.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.522
       Abby and Eliott
        What the Fu--

25:30.795 --> 25:31.762
Hey, guys!

25:31.764 --> 25:32.863
Where is she?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.131
Oh, my shoe!

25:34.133 --> 25:37.201
We know you kidnapped Laila!

25:38.704 --> 25:45.009
Owwww!! Ohhh Goddd,
           owwwww!!

25:45.011 --> 25:46.010
       Where did she go?!

25:46.012 --> 25:46.977
She locked the door!

25:51.917 --> 25:53.884
    Ohhh, no, no, no wait.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.053
 Wait, we have your money. We
       have your money!

26:02.895 --> 26:06.830
I'm gonna to kill you! Jill!!!

26:08.233 --> 26:10.734
Oh! Watch out! Watch out! Outta
          the way!

26:10.736 --> 26:13.938
    Outta the way! Laila!
       Lailaaaaaaa!!!!

26:17.243 --> 26:20.644
Here's your fucking shoe!

26:22.147 --> 26:30.821
Oh, my God. You think you know
          somebody.

26:31.222 --> 26:33.524
You don't think she made her go
           in this?

26:33.526 --> 26:34.959
How much money?

26:34.961 --> 26:35.960
Thirty grand.

26:35.962 --> 26:39.930
Thirty G's? Hell no!

26:39.932 --> 26:42.766
   No money, no way, no how.

26:42.768 --> 26:46.570
You don't negotiate with
         terrorists.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.205
Just look for clues
        or something.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.075
This is all just junk!

26:52.712 --> 26:57.881
Ugh. Check on this. Check that
   out. Put that somewhere.

26:57.883 --> 26:59.216
I can't do anything with
            that!

26:59.218 --> 27:03.120
 Just fucking taxes from two
        thousand an--

27:06.958 --> 27:09.893
You guys better come
        look at this.

27:17.202 --> 27:20.204
Oh, my God.

27:20.206 --> 27:24.041
We gotta catch that bitch and
        take her down.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.976
  Where do you think she went?

27:25.978 --> 27:28.345
No idea.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.682
- Wait a minute. Gimme your phone.
- Gimme your phone.

27:31.684 --> 27:32.683
    I think I can track her.

27:32.685 --> 27:33.784
How?

27:33.786 --> 27:36.320
I'm gonna drop a pin in her ass.

27:37.289 --> 27:41.125
We're doing the right thing,
        right Littles?

27:41.127 --> 27:44.795
I mean, you were suffocating in
     those clothes and...

27:44.797 --> 27:49.299
  oh that stroller! God. You
 must've felt like an idiot.

27:54.940 --> 27:59.109
If you wanna go back, bark three
    times in a row, okay?

27:59.111 --> 28:01.345
         I'm listening.

28:01.347 --> 28:06.116
Good.
   I agree with you. Whew.

28:06.118 --> 28:09.620
Two independent girls, out on
         the road...

28:09.622 --> 28:11.722
 kickin' ass and takin' names.

28:11.724 --> 28:16.794
        Whoooooohoooooo!

28:17.263 --> 28:20.931
Get on the highway. She got to
         the highway.

28:20.933 --> 28:21.765
      Tur-turn right here.

28:21.767 --> 28:24.034
Wait, right there?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.069
Ri--ya missed it!

28:25.071 --> 28:25.636
I'm sorry!

28:25.638 --> 28:27.004
Okay!

28:27.006 --> 28:30.174
This is exciting!

28:30.176 --> 28:33.277
I feel like we're on and episode
       of Hart to Hart.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.846
Jill, please, please,
   please please, please...

28:35.848 --> 28:38.749
she'll just turn her phone off
   and we'll lose the blip.

28:38.751 --> 28:41.018
Please just pull over somewhere
       so we can- Kat!

28:41.020 --> 28:43.020
Listen, you skinny circus freak

28:43.022 --> 28:44.088
Don't!

28:44.090 --> 28:45.089
Forget about the ransom.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.824
You're not going to see one red
            cent.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.927
Turn the fuck around and give
them back their dog, or I'll-

28:49.929 --> 28:51.695
Don't!

28:51.697 --> 28:52.930
Just look at the map.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.732
I can't tell which dot is ours.

28:54.734 --> 28:55.999
Ours is the one with the arrow.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.000
It's upside down!

28:57.002 --> 28:58.068
Well, flip it back over.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.336
Which dot!

28:59.338 --> 29:02.106
It's not a dot! Why are you such
        a computard?!

29:07.212 --> 29:09.413
Littles, I love you so much...

29:09.415 --> 29:14.051
so F-ing much, that if I ever
lost you, I would shoot myself--

29:14.053 --> 29:20.424
 in the head like this. Ruff!
        Ruff! Blooood!

29:20.426 --> 29:24.094
   Blood and guts and brain
 everywhere. Oh, there's that

29:24.096 --> 29:27.231
   memory. There's, there's
that time I went with Kent...

29:27.233 --> 29:31.068
to the-to the diner and I had to
        buy his food.

29:31.070 --> 29:34.805
And there's that time that I got
made fun of in second grade.

29:34.807 --> 29:38.909
And there's that time that my
mom said I looked like a boy.

29:38.911 --> 29:42.980
everywhere,
  all across the windshield.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.915
    Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

29:52.757 --> 29:57.261
Oh, my god! That's an invitation
        to pedophiles.

29:57.263 --> 30:01.265
Hey pervert, here's all the info
 you need to kidnap my kids.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.200
Now you can address them by name
   when you invite them...

30:03.202 --> 30:06.737
     into your creepy van.

30:06.739 --> 30:09.139
You can even
    invite Doug the cat.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.775
      So the cat can get
fucked. In da back of da van.

30:11.777 --> 30:12.776
Kat! Kat.

30:12.778 --> 30:16.980
Yeah, you shouldn't say
       stuff like that.
What?

30:29.428 --> 30:32.429
    I know Kat said that I
 wouldn't pay you anything,

30:32.431 --> 30:38.035
but I'm willing to go halves.
That's fifteen thousand dollars!

30:41.173 --> 30:46.376
I know you need it, so I am
    willing to compromise.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.212
What are you doing?

30:48.214 --> 30:51.481
I told you not to call her.

30:51.483 --> 30:54.051
             Phone.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.085
It's funny how people
          always d-

31:28.087 --> 31:30.053
It's not funny.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.894
Stop the car. Mama needs more
            vino.

31:41.833 --> 31:48.538
Jill. Jill, listen. You can have
        all the money.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.440
Jus-just tell us where to meet
            you...

31:50.442 --> 31:53.377
 and you can have all of it,
      okay? I gotta go,

31:53.379 --> 31:57.214
  but please, please, please
        call me back.

32:08.993 --> 32:12.629
Signal's gone. Wonder why, Abby.

32:12.631 --> 32:16.566
She turned her phone off! I told
     you not to call her!

32:16.568 --> 32:19.903
It's like I'm not even here
          sometimes!

32:19.905 --> 32:23.974
    Jesus Christ, you know
   I do know some things!

32:23.976 --> 32:25.943
        Fuck! Goddamnit!

32:25.945 --> 32:30.247
I'm sorry! I am sorry!

32:32.518 --> 32:35.085
What if we never find her?

32:35.087 --> 32:37.921
I'll buy you another Yorkie!

32:39.658 --> 32:40.891
Vino!

32:40.893 --> 32:43.260
Here!

32:43.262 --> 32:45.028
Put your seat belt on!

32:45.030 --> 32:48.131
I was going to!

32:50.436 --> 32:53.303
Oh, stop it!

33:00.945 --> 33:02.312
What's the game plan here?

33:02.314 --> 33:03.413
We'll keep checking the phone...

33:03.415 --> 33:05.215
 and hopefully she'll show up
            again.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.617
I'm exhausted. Nap and then
           dinner?

33:07.619 --> 33:11.321
Nap!

33:11.323 --> 33:14.091
         Okay. Us too.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.235
Oh, my god.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.237
It's not that bad.

33:28.607 --> 33:32.442
Ah. Oh, my God get it off. Get
     it off. Get it off!

33:32.444 --> 33:35.512
Help! Help me!

33:35.514 --> 33:37.114
Don't be a helpless victim.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.416
 With the Medical alert belt
clip, help is only a beep away.

33:39.418 --> 33:42.252
Did Jill turn her phone
             on?

33:42.254 --> 33:43.020
No.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.664
I'm going to get us some water.

34:04.976 --> 34:07.611
Grab a hard piece of
        wood. Cherry-

34:07.613 --> 34:09.478
Getting to first base in
          baseball-

34:57.261 --> 34:59.696
I got us fried chicken!

34:59.698 --> 35:01.031
 My favorite part of road trips

35:01.033 --> 35:02.666
    is being forced to eat
        fat-ass food.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.201
 Too bad I couldn't find the
         Creamy Cone.

35:04.203 --> 35:07.604
Ah! Have I told you how much I
         missed you?

35:07.606 --> 35:08.538
That's so sweet.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.042
What is that?

35:12.044 --> 35:15.145
You smell so good.
 What is that? Biscuit flour?

35:15.147 --> 35:16.680
Okay. We already tried that at
         Lilith Fair.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.516
I'm not being sexual, it's just
   that you smell really...

35:19.518 --> 35:21.785
that my Grandma used to make for
  me and I really miss her-

35:21.787 --> 35:23.420
Okay, you're a freak.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.521
No! No!

35:24.523 --> 35:28.792
Who wants some
     Chick-Chick-Chicken?

35:31.062 --> 35:33.163
Is that your Mom?

35:35.567 --> 35:37.701
I'll be in the bar.

35:37.703 --> 35:40.670
   How can this place not
         have a bar?

35:50.715 --> 35:53.083
Hey if you want to talk...
           okay...

35:53.085 --> 35:54.451
Stan and Dan Janson...

35:54.453 --> 35:57.420
Private Investigators at your
           service.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.356
  Is your spouse cheating on
             you?

35:59.358 --> 36:01.291
You need Real Professionals.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.426
Is your employee embezzling
            funds?

36:03.428 --> 36:05.295
You need Real Professionals.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.296
Are you searching...

36:06.298 --> 36:07.497
    for a long lost parent?

36:07.499 --> 36:08.832
You need Real Professionals.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.400
If you answered yes-

36:10.402 --> 36:11.501
Yes!

36:11.503 --> 36:13.837
to any of those questions.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.205
     Then you need to call-

36:15.207 --> 36:18.375
Us! Real Professionals!

36:18.377 --> 36:23.113
Reeeaal Professionals.

36:23.115 --> 36:25.148
How much longer are we
   going to hang out here?

36:25.150 --> 36:28.852
What do you mean? As long as it
            takes.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.387
The movers are coming tomorrow.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.322
We need to figure this out, make
        some calls...

36:32.324 --> 36:34.691
   start cancelling stuff,
something. She may never turn

36:34.693 --> 36:37.294
her phone back on again. That's
 totally possible, you know.

36:37.296 --> 36:40.297
We have no leads, nothing to go
     on. The ransom's...

36:40.299 --> 36:42.465
 not even an option anymore.
She's too scared to claim it.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.633
How do you know?

36:43.635 --> 36:45.669
You can't get inside her head
     any more than I can.

36:45.671 --> 36:48.138
What- the- what the hell am I
supposed to tell my new boss,

36:48.140 --> 36:50.774
huh? Sorry, I can't move to San
        Francisco...

36:50.776 --> 36:51.841
  cause my dog was kidnapped?

36:51.843 --> 36:53.410
Tell him someone died.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.679
Tell him your Mom died. I don't
            care.

36:55.681 --> 37:01.518
   Laila and I would never
      move without you.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.654
         I need candy.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.289
Go get your candy.

37:27.945 --> 37:30.280
Come on, Littles. Come on.

37:55.740 --> 37:56.806
What's the plan?

37:56.808 --> 37:57.507
Shhhhh!

37:57.509 --> 37:59.342
You go that way.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.911
- You go that way.
- I'll go this way.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.947
Just do what I say!

38:12.690 --> 38:14.858
I don't know what I'm supposed
            to do.

38:16.962 --> 38:17.527
Gimme that!

38:21.733 --> 38:22.899
Oh god!

38:22.901 --> 38:24.534
My eyes!

38:27.539 --> 38:28.972
Oh, crap! Oh crap!

38:36.281 --> 38:37.480
Oh, my god it burns!

38:37.482 --> 38:41.718
Oh, my god it burns. Oh, my god!

38:42.453 --> 38:44.688
Oh, please let them be okay.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.257
Don't look at me like that. It
          was dark.

38:47.259 --> 38:49.893
  I thought they were rapists.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.795
       Where is my purse?

38:52.530 --> 38:54.364
Oh, I need water.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.500
You two need Real Professionals.

39:02.606 --> 39:06.309
Yeah, she's adorable. I'm sorry
     for your loss guys.

39:06.311 --> 39:07.510
Thank you.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.679
Anyways, uh...

39:09.681 --> 39:11.715
let's get the necessities out of
          the way.

39:11.717 --> 39:15.051
     The fee is gonna be
    $10,000 upon recovery.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.953
No problem.

39:20.291 --> 39:23.893
Oh, my god. Ahhh, yeah, okay.

39:23.895 --> 39:27.063
Laila, she have any, ah, friends
  that are a little more...

39:27.065 --> 39:28.798
unsavoury, maybe someone with a
         criminal...

39:28.800 --> 39:31.301
record, a background, somethin'
          like that?

39:31.303 --> 39:34.304
Oh, we know who did it. It was
    our dog sitter, Jill.

39:34.306 --> 39:36.573
She did this.

39:36.575 --> 39:37.374
She did?

39:37.376 --> 39:38.975
She attacked us.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.711
We don't feel comfortable...

39:41.713 --> 39:43.046
  approaching her ourselves
         anymore...

39:43.048 --> 39:44.347
    I mean, you can see why.

39:44.349 --> 39:45.315
She sounds terrible.

39:45.317 --> 39:48.651
Thank you.

39:50.855 --> 39:53.523
  She told us that Laila was
    kidnapped and then...

39:53.525 --> 39:56.359
  we caught her walking her
    outside her apartment.

39:56.361 --> 39:57.794
Whaaat? That's crazy.

39:57.796 --> 39:58.528
She's-Yes!

39:58.530 --> 39:59.929
   She's a pathological liar.

39:59.931 --> 40:03.032
And she was wasted at our going
         away party.

40:03.034 --> 40:08.705
Here's a photo of her. Don't be
fooled by that Holiday smile.

40:08.707 --> 40:12.742
- She's pretty.
- She's really pretty.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.444
Are you sure this is the girl?

40:14.446 --> 40:16.646
   I-I don't see how a girl
 this pretty could steal a d-

40:16.648 --> 40:18.581
           Ah. Uh...

40:18.583 --> 40:20.083
She did this.

40:20.085 --> 40:20.917
She did this.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.752
Yeah. I'll find her.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.522
   I promise you guys. Okay?

40:45.644 --> 40:51.448
Why is he eating now? Shouldn't
  he be catching up to her?

40:53.584 --> 40:56.085
Ugh.

41:08.732 --> 41:13.703
Thirty seven cents and two
       ketchup packets.

41:13.705 --> 41:19.142
 That's all we have, Littles.
     Wanna meet my Mom?

41:33.757 --> 41:35.959
I guess she's busy, Littles.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.095
Hey! Hey! The blip came back on!

41:39.097 --> 41:42.932
Hold on. Hold on. Let me handle
            this.

41:42.934 --> 41:45.668
Okay.

41:58.850 --> 42:03.019
Hey, Dan. Jill's GPS says she's
    just west of the 95...

42:03.021 --> 42:04.854
and it looks like there aren't
    any towns around there

42:04.856 --> 42:08.858
 or anything, so I'm thinkin'
she must be at a... rest stop?

42:08.860 --> 42:10.226
Yeah-oh great!

42:10.228 --> 42:13.496
 Perfect! Yeah, I'm just, I'm
 drivin' just east of there.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.164
Oh, you are huh?

42:15.166 --> 42:17.534
You-you said the 95, right?

42:17.536 --> 42:18.835
Yeah.

42:18.837 --> 42:21.137
Okay.  Not a problem.

42:21.139 --> 42:23.540
   I am on the case. Got it.

42:39.691 --> 42:43.593
   Have you forgotten what
     she did to our eyes?

43:03.814 --> 43:05.248
Why is he taking photos?

43:05.250 --> 43:08.585
We already showed him a picture
           of her.

43:08.587 --> 43:10.353
She's going to the B room.

44:21.358 --> 44:23.359
What is he doing in there?!

44:23.361 --> 44:25.795
Why do you think I know what's
         he's doing?!

44:32.736 --> 44:34.604
If Laila's only hope is him...

44:34.606 --> 44:36.773
   then that pooch is Gone
         Doggy Gone.

44:36.775 --> 44:38.608
The Hell she is!

44:48.252 --> 44:50.353
What are you guys doin' here,
huh?! You guys followin' me?!

44:50.355 --> 44:51.788
Someone has to be a detective!

44:51.790 --> 44:52.755
Ah-ha-ha!

44:52.757 --> 44:54.257
    I am being a detective!

44:54.259 --> 44:57.026
    I-I-took incriminating
 photos and I bugged her car!

44:57.028 --> 44:58.361
Why didn't you just grab her
     while she was here?

44:58.363 --> 45:00.897
There's proper protocol you have
         to follow!

45:00.899 --> 45:02.799
   These things take time,
            guys!

45:02.801 --> 45:06.135
Come on! If I just grabbed her
    that's battery, okay?!

45:06.137 --> 45:09.005
Stop following me, go back to
        your motel...

45:09.007 --> 45:12.341
and I'll call ya when I get the
    dog. How 'bout that?

45:31.763 --> 45:33.329
We'll stay at my Mom's in New
           Mexico-

45:33.331 --> 45:35.965
Yes! New Mexico! Let's do this!

45:35.967 --> 45:39.102
And then we'll get back on our
feet  and hit the road, Thelma!

45:39.104 --> 45:41.738
         Arf! Arf! Arf!

45:57.922 --> 46:02.759
Just had a very interesting
conversation with the Harmons.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.193
      They are not happy.

46:04.195 --> 46:08.931
Said you took all kinds of
     photos of that girl,

46:08.933 --> 46:10.933
     and then let her get
     away. Is that right?

46:10.935 --> 46:14.837
  -it is right, but I-I was
  establishing a pattern of

46:14.839 --> 46:17.840
behavior to determine my rescue
          approach.

46:17.842 --> 46:26.282
- Danny! What did I say? KISS.
K-I-S-S. Keep it simple, stupid!

46:26.284 --> 46:27.750
  You know where she is right?

46:27.752 --> 46:30.920
Yes. Yes. I'm tailin' her right
 now. I got her in my sights.

46:30.922 --> 46:38.261
Ah. Yeah, well, uh, then I don't
   see what the problem is.

46:38.263 --> 46:42.031
   Mmmm. Get the Goddamn dog!

46:42.033 --> 46:45.468
Hello?

46:47.971 --> 46:49.438
Stan and Dan Janson.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.474
    Private Investigators
         at your ser-

46:51.476 --> 46:53.910
Barracks were utterly destroyed.

46:53.912 --> 46:57.280
Most of the Military Personnel
of approximately 20 thousand...

46:57.282 --> 47:00.383
were wiped out. The distorted
steel framework is all that...

47:00.385 --> 47:02.084
 remains of a building which
        stood four...

47:02.086 --> 47:05.188
Did Dan respond to your
  text or call or anything?

47:05.190 --> 47:10.293
Let's see, thirty seconds ago
     he didn't respond...

47:10.295 --> 47:14.397
a minute ago he didn't respond,
       two minutes ago-

47:14.399 --> 47:20.036
Okay! I get it. Don't
     be a dick about it.

47:20.038 --> 47:26.375
  Sorry. I'm annoying myself.

47:47.798 --> 47:52.034
What's this? You're a smoker
    tryin' to quit, huh?

47:52.036 --> 47:59.008
Nope. Just spearmint.

47:59.010 --> 48:03.112
Ah. Cutesy little doll. Maybe a
   little drug trafficking?

48:03.114 --> 48:07.884
No. Just a doll. Whoa. That's
            uh...

48:07.886 --> 48:13.356
   That doll's had a rough
            time.

48:13.358 --> 48:20.129
Whoa. Look at you, Jill. What's
   this for, huh? Stabbin'?

48:20.131 --> 48:22.398
Doin' one of these?! Doin' one
   of these to somebody?!

48:22.400 --> 48:25.034
           Heh heh.
  You're goin' down, babe.

48:25.036 --> 48:34.176
  You are being tracked by a
   professional. Uhh. Kay.

48:37.981 --> 48:45.922
   Puppy rescue. Children's
          Hospital.

48:45.924 --> 48:52.428
 She saves whales. She saves
          everyone.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.634
             Hmph.

49:09.212 --> 49:12.615
           Oh, Jill.

49:47.150 --> 49:49.418
- Arf! Arf! Arf!
- Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

49:52.322 --> 49:56.425
- Kat, go for a walk or something.
- You're driving us crazy.

49:58.695 --> 50:00.596
Stop it.

50:00.598 --> 50:03.132
I can't. Devon took my medicine.

50:03.134 --> 50:04.700
- It's not medicine.
- It's a crutch.

50:04.702 --> 50:08.671
If it makes me feel better, it's
          medicine.

50:22.452 --> 50:28.090
- What's up? It's okay. I'm cool.
- See I have a license.

50:28.092 --> 50:31.293
 It's my get out of jail free
 card. Like if a cop came by,

50:31.295 --> 50:37.600
     you could hand it to
     me and we'd be cool.

50:37.602 --> 50:40.336
Phew....

50:45.509 --> 50:54.350
- Oh, yes... You saved my life.
- Can I buy a little off you,

50:54.352 --> 50:58.487
or a lot? I mean, however much
you can spare. I'm desperate,

50:58.489 --> 51:02.725
well not desperate, okay, I'm
 desperate.  I-I'm travelling

51:02.727 --> 51:06.395
with The Borings. Looking for
their kidnapped dog. The amount

51:06.397 --> 51:08.764
of ransom they're spending on
that dog could feed a village

51:08.766 --> 51:11.634
   in Somalia. I mean, I do
love Africa though. I've been to

51:11.636 --> 51:16.605
Okay, just, shut
         up...please.

51:16.607 --> 51:18.140
It's a hundred.

51:18.142 --> 51:20.276
What?! That's not even an
 eighth. I've got like twenty

51:20.278 --> 51:23.646
bucks! Wait! I'll grab some cash
off The Borings. They're just a

51:23.648 --> 51:27.450
few doors down.  It'll
only take me a sec. Did I tell

51:27.452 --> 51:31.420
you that I love your tattoo? I
almost got a tribal tattoo once

51:31.422 --> 51:34.190
in Fiji, but Ichickened out when
I saw the  size of the needle. I

51:34.192 --> 51:36.158
    mean it was this giant
   porcupine quill covered

51:36.160 --> 51:38.494
in blood. Now, this was the 80's
  and AIDS was no laughing

51:38.496 --> 51:42.198
matter. I was like, okay, stick
     that in my ass HIV.

51:42.200 --> 51:47.403
Ah! Thank you! Thank
   you! Thank you!

  my car hadn't broken down
  and you hadn't stopped to

56:11.869 --> 56:14.737
save us, well we'd never know
 that there was someone else

56:14.739 --> 56:19.608
 out there on the same lonely
highway with the same motto.
         Wow, right?

56:19.610 --> 56:21.844
Yeah. Yeah, wow.

56:21.846 --> 56:25.547

How are we gonna pay
        for the rooms?

56:44.033 --> 56:46.568
Why did they target us? What
      did we do to them?

Sometimes bad things happen
       to good people.

 holiday. We're very close.

57:22.139 --> 57:25.374
She taught me everything I know
      about sandwiches.

57:25.376 --> 57:30.012
Yeah, Dean, I know. I know I'm
late. I know, okay, uh, what did

57:30.014 --> 57:32.948

  were again? Hold on, just,

  off the phone somebody's,

57:36.587 --> 57:41.156
somebody's here. Okay, talk to
    you later. Bye.

57:42.959 --> 57:46.028
- What are you doing here?
- You could have called.

57:46.030 --> 57:48.597
I tried, but you didn't pick up.

57:48.599 --> 57:52.434
Tell your boyfriend to
 move the car. I'm late for a

            phone!

58:25.469 --> 58:31.673
Ugh, believe me I'd love to, but
I'm obligated to my clients. Oh

way. Ah... the code is 8-5-6-7-9

58:39.617 --> 58:44.219
     hmm...uh...sorry can
 you hold for just a moment?

58:44.221 --> 58:48.090
Could I stay with you? Just
      for a little bit?

58:48.092 --> 58:54.530
- You always push.
- Fine. The key's in the

58:54.532 --> 59:00.669
armadillo. I'll be back by one
    and we'll sort it out.

59:02.972 --> 59:08.911
And don't slam the door. You
 have to press in the tongue

59:08.913 --> 59:11.747
   and release. No slamming!

59:23.526 --> 59:34.269
Hey! Please stop! Stop.

59:43.980 --> 59:50.152

- And ah...I wanted to give you

59:50.154 --> 01:00:02.698
privacy. Oh! Here's your dog
back. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:10.238
Umm... we're running low
           on fuel.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.840
Oh, great!

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:14.276

Shit! Come on! You want me to
 do that?! I'm not doin' it!

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:20.068
There's no way! No way in Hell
I'm doin' it! Hello? You were on

Alright.

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:29.324
Oh, my God. When I see her,
I'm going to give her so many

01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:30.492
        caramel kisses.

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:34.329
Oops.

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:37.866
Now, Where were we?

01:05:37.868 --> 01:05:40.969
They were talking about
          their dog.

01:05:40.971 --> 01:05:45.240
So, how did you two come
          together?

01:05:45.242 --> 01:05:51.413
I asked her out after yoga
  class and she told me she
        was a lesbian.

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:54.149
I had to. It's like,
all the other guys I went out

01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:58.987
None of them were
right! Especially Robert. Pfft.

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.324
What did you tell her about
           Robert?

01:06:02.326 --> 01:06:06.328
Nothing. She's in tune.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:10.231

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:13.168
Yeah, right.

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:19.975
You have a really nice place.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:31.519
I have to get real here. I'm
vibing in some very dangerous

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:41.129
fear between you two and it's
poison. It's toxic! I'm sorry

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:46.034
    but that's it. No more
bullshit stories. Yoga didn't

01:06:46.036 --> 01:06:48.103
      bring you together.

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:49.304
That's how we met.

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:52.107
No! What brought you
      together really?!

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.342
I don't know what?

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:57.679
Oh ho ho! Have you thought about
why you're crossing your arms?
             Hmm?

01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:58.680
Because it's comfortable?

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:01.483
Because it's freezing in here?

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:06.621
Because you're closing yourself
 off. Because you're afraid!

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:07.655
Afraid of what?

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:08.556
You tell me.

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:10.058
No, you tell me.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.526
Is "no" your favorite word?

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.762
No.

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:16.698
Don't.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.633
Let these-

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:19.267

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:20.969
No.

01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:22.203
Push the reset button!

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.204
No.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.607
Is it so hard to say yes?

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:29.477
- I'll never understand that.
- It's so easy. Yes!

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:30.178
No.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:30.745

No! Okay! Yes! Yes! Mother
fucking yes! Are you all happy?

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:42.223
       Is this happiness?

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:46.761
You're together because your
souls are working to rectify an

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:48.797

too exhausting to fight back.

She like never, like, told
    anyone we were dating.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:42.210

       out every night.

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:45.513
You know, Kent didn't like
   to cuddle. He couldn't

 stand being touched unless
      he instigated it.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:49.716
Ugh.

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:43.985
    you got us robbed, or
    you're sorry that you

01:13:43.987 --> 01:13:47.355

- Laila is our baby.

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:17.652

you when you push her around in
        that stroller!

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:20.955

- Have a baby.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.762
I don't want a baby.

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:29.430
Wait. You don't want a baby?

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:31.566
Why the Hell not?

01:14:31.568 --> 01:14:33.935
None of your business!

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:37.505
I thought we were
waiting until we're financially
        ready to like-

01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:39.540
It's not about the
 money. I work seventy hours

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:42.610
 a week. I don't have time. I
   travel. I'm bi-coastal.

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:44.145
      I'm in Europe half
          the year.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:46.447
Then quit your job
and start your clothing line!

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:47.648
      What's the problem?

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:51.752
Yeah, I mean you
   could work from home and

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:54.422
we can like pool our resources
          together-

01:14:54.424 --> 01:14:55.723
You're folding your
         arms again!

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:58.025
So, you are closed off!

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.694
Abby, open up!

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:03.498
Wh- why, tell us why, you don't
 want a baby? I want to know!

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.899
Why don't you
       want a baby?!!!

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:09.070
Okay! Okay! Okay! I am...
      afraid of babies.

01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:10.805
Really?

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:13.441
Yes.

01:15:13.443 --> 01:15:15.476
What?

01:15:15.478 --> 01:15:21.983
I...have never actually held
one. I've had the opportunity,

01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:27.021
but I'm afraid that I will drop
  them because they are soft

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:30.725
and delicate and they are like
little birds with no feathers.

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:32.560
Are you serious right now?

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:35.730
I'm totally serious. It is not
 hard to accidentally kill a

01:15:35.732 --> 01:15:38.065
baby. People do it all the time.
It's always on the news. They

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:42.837
have tiny breathing holes and
 their heads are mushy. What

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:45.239
if you think that they're crying
and they're actually bleeding

01:15:45.241 --> 01:15:48.175
internally? I don't want that
kind of pressure. I don't want

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:50.011
      to be a bad parent.

01:15:50.013 --> 01:15:58.853
- That's so fucking stupid.
- That came out wrong.

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:04.058
it's just...I want someone to
     make a family with.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.928
Well, then stop dating boy
 scouts and date someone with

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:11.866
some faults like the rest of us.
You deserve Taylor Lautner and,

01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:14.101
         and the rest
  of us get Jason Alexander?

01:16:14.103 --> 01:16:16.771
Thanks.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:21.008
Grow up, Kat. You're 42.

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:30.117
I am?

 me to trust you for a while.

I know.

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:24.105
But you're my best friend
    and I love you. I do!

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.141
I love you too.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.710
And I want to believe. I do, I
    believe that you were

01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:35.716
   fucked up and lonely and
 desperate and really creepy!

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:36.717
Thank you!

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:37.785
Don't! Don't push it.

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:39.387
'kay.

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:50.798
But mostly you've been a really
good friend to me. And I want

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:57.171
 you to know that I did hear
  you, and...I will consider

01:17:57.173 --> 01:18:01.776
  giving up the stroller and
   possibly the baby Bjorn.

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:10.985
And I'll cut back on the wine
  except on the weekend, and

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:18.192
Holidays and special occasions,
but otherwise it's like, none!

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:19.126

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:22.196
Okay.

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:24.398
I..I-I'm still gonna wipe
 Laila's ass with baby wipes

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.867
  because to me that's just
 hygienic and she sleeps in
           the bed.

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:29.270
Agreed.

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.780

it's... I'll support you in any
 decision you plan on making,

01:19:45.348 --> 01:19:50.117
  okay? Cause I know you'll
     make the right one.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:54.455
  Cause you're a good person.

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:57.458
The right decision is to give
        the dog back.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:01.929

- Jill is willing to give Laila

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:18.846
    back, but no jail time.

01:20:18.848 --> 01:20:21.916
A-And the ransom, the
   ransom was just a ruse.

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:25.286

     everybody wins here.

Ah. Ah, no, let, let's, let's
just say things have changed,

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:36.263
            alright?

He's fucking her.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.367

   it? And I want ten grand

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:43.437

 not a ransom. I want to make

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:48.475

       Say it.

     be twenty paces in.
