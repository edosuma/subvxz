WEBVTT

01:02.825 --> 01:03.908
Mm.

01:06.325 --> 01:08.033
Weed.

01:09.658 --> 01:10.867
Why did I do that?

01:10.950 --> 01:14.283
I was being bold,
that's why my mouth is...

01:15.867 --> 01:17.283
dry. Water.

01:21.533 --> 01:24.158
I always worry that weed
will make me idle, you know?

01:24.242 --> 01:26.950
Indecisive, or less ambitious,
which would be awful.

01:27.033 --> 01:28.533
Well, you seem happy.

01:28.658 --> 01:29.742
Happier.

01:29.825 --> 01:31.367
Relaxed.

01:31.450 --> 01:32.658
No, I'm just tired really.

01:32.742 --> 01:33.742
Spirited.

01:34.617 --> 01:37.033
Self-conscious.

01:37.325 --> 01:39.033
Go on, then. Eat it.

01:39.450 --> 01:41.033
Eat to your heart's content.

01:41.242 --> 01:42.825
Eat till your hands
swell so much

01:42.908 --> 01:44.408
you can't handle the cutlery.

01:44.617 --> 01:45.908
Another bread basket?

01:46.200 --> 01:47.325
Yes, please.

01:51.908 --> 01:53.492
So why are you single, Pete?

01:54.867 --> 01:57.867
What's not to love about Pete?

01:57.950 --> 01:59.867
Uh, well, I'm just gonna
be plain with you.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.575
I find women,
in the main, intolerable.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.992
But I realised
that I can't live without one.

02:05.075 --> 02:06.658
No, I won't live without one.

02:07.075 --> 02:08.158
Right.

02:11.908 --> 02:15.742
My parents, I mean, it's hard
to find a love like that.

02:16.242 --> 02:17.408
You know, well hung.

02:17.492 --> 02:19.658
I wanna feel lonesome
when my woman leaves the room...

02:19.742 --> 02:21.367
- No, you don't.
- He does that, my dad

02:21.408 --> 02:23.783
he sort of hovers by the door
while my mother takes a moment.

02:23.867 --> 02:26.075
- God, how stifling.
- Or just lovely?

02:26.158 --> 02:27.200
No.

02:32.825 --> 02:36.408
Mandy, uh, I ought
to be straight with you.

02:36.492 --> 02:37.367
Um...

02:38.283 --> 02:39.617
I'm a man of faith.

02:39.700 --> 02:40.867
You're fucking joking.

02:40.950 --> 02:43.033
No, I am a religious enthusiast.

02:43.117 --> 02:45.117
W-what a strange thing to say.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.617
Come on, it's nice.
I live with hope.

02:46.658 --> 02:47.700
- Do you?
- I'm just saying

02:47.742 --> 02:49.117
- I'm a believer.
- Well, I'm...

02:55.950 --> 02:57.158
Let's just be honest here...

02:57.242 --> 02:58.617
That seems to be
the measure of things.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.825
I have no reason
to appeal to you.

03:01.908 --> 03:03.325
- Then why are you here?
- I dunno, Pete

03:03.408 --> 03:05.867
- cos I found you interesting.
- Not enough to suck me off?

03:32.825 --> 03:34.783
In the spirit of honesty, Pete

03:34.867 --> 03:38.617
you should know
I give really bad blowjobs.

03:38.742 --> 03:40.950
- You do have a lot of teeth.
- No, my...

03:41.325 --> 03:42.992
my teeth are just big.
It's deceiving.

03:43.075 --> 03:45.700
I actually have the correct
number of teeth in my head. 32.

03:45.783 --> 03:48.492
What have you got in there,
a little bag of shrapnel?

03:48.575 --> 03:49.950
I can see your
bloody nerve endings.

03:49.992 --> 03:52.033
If we had a child, we might
actually produce something

03:52.075 --> 03:53.033
with average-sized teeth.

03:53.075 --> 03:54.950
Well, that would be
a wonderful accomplishment.

03:55.033 --> 03:56.950
Uh, you already have a child,
right?

03:57.033 --> 03:58.575
- Yeah.
- What are his teeth like?

04:00.158 --> 04:02.242
Dickensian.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.742
And where's
the bastard's father?

04:03.825 --> 04:05.450
Ugh.

04:08.617 --> 04:11.075
You set the tone, love,
with all that blowjob jive.

04:11.158 --> 04:12.450
When you look at my mouth

04:12.658 --> 04:15.075
do you think it would
be anything shy of toothy?

04:15.158 --> 04:16.616
What do you...
What do you want, Pete?

04:16.700 --> 04:19.616
Do you want teeth by day,
gums by night?

04:19.700 --> 04:20.908
You want me
in a set of dentures.

04:20.991 --> 04:22.742
L-Let's just wrap this evening up

04:22.825 --> 04:24.325
with the strap line
"grounds for marriage."

04:24.408 --> 04:26.617
No, I don't wanna
fucking talk about marriage.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.742
No, I mean, this feels like

04:27.783 --> 04:29.242
the beginning
of some missionary shit.

04:29.325 --> 04:31.033
- God is love.
- Religious persuasion.

04:31.158 --> 04:33.242
I don't wanna marry you,
you'd be a shit wife.

04:33.325 --> 04:34.742
- Yeah, I would.
- You're a modern woman.

04:34.783 --> 04:36.825
You want people to think
what you say matters.

04:36.908 --> 04:38.617
You want your dinner
on the table, right?

04:38.700 --> 04:39.700
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

04:39.783 --> 04:42.325
Y'know, you talk of men
wanting gummy blowjobs.

04:42.408 --> 04:43.867
Women want more head than ever.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.783
Y'know, less intimacy,
more head.

04:45.867 --> 04:47.075
More head. Shit!

04:47.158 --> 04:49.117
Women these days
have got more testosterone

04:49.200 --> 04:51.242
coursing through their veins
than blood.

04:56.408 --> 04:57.492
Oh, my God.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.117
Mm.

05:05.325 --> 05:06.450
You're gonna...

05:06.533 --> 05:08.492
You're gonna rape me tonight,
aren't you?

05:10.408 --> 05:14.325
I mean, those are
classic rapist remarks.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.700
Uh...

05:22.492 --> 05:25.533
- I've made you uncomfortable.
- No, I feel incredibly relaxed.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.075
Now, should I get the bill,
or does that guarantee a raping?

05:32.158 --> 05:34.492
- I'll get the fucking bill.
- OK, well, thank you.

05:43.783 --> 05:46.033
You'll marry me in a year.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.242
Unlikely.

05:47.325 --> 05:49.367
Oh, come on. We get on.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.992
I don't want this to be some
three-year arrangement

05:52.075 --> 05:52.992
where we're...

05:53.033 --> 05:55.242
you're haemorrhaging
your youth to no end.

05:55.325 --> 05:56.700
Work will do that, modern woman.

05:56.783 --> 05:58.825
Let's just say that if,
after a year

05:58.908 --> 06:00.242
we're undecided about marriage

06:00.283 --> 06:02.117
then we'll just...
we'll part company.

06:03.950 --> 06:06.158
I could see that coming,
you ate like a pig.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.325
Come on, please.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.492
Just think about me all night.
I pretty much adore you.

06:10.575 --> 06:11.575
Taxi!

06:11.700 --> 06:14.492
I'm gonna go home and wank over
your Instagram pictures, OK?

06:14.617 --> 06:16.408
But only the ones
with your mouth closed.

06:16.825 --> 06:18.992
Well, I'll look into dentures
in the morning.

06:19.075 --> 06:20.117
It's a deal-breaker.

07:16.242 --> 07:17.492
- Mum.
- Mandy.

07:24.408 --> 07:25.575
What time did he go to bed?

07:25.658 --> 07:28.242
7pm on the dot.
No fuckin' around.

07:28.408 --> 07:29.492
Dad called.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.408
What did he say?

07:31.492 --> 07:32.908
A loan was unlikely.

07:33.825 --> 07:34.950
Are you drunk?

07:35.075 --> 07:36.992
It's the HRT. It makes me slur.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.533
Anyway, I'm off
to see the solicitor on Friday.

07:40.617 --> 07:42.700
So, I'll know once and for all.

07:43.325 --> 07:46.075
Be good to know one way
or another, do I get a house?

07:46.492 --> 07:49.075
This Pete,
are his parents still together?

07:49.158 --> 07:50.825
Oh, I assume so.
They're religious.

07:50.908 --> 07:52.200
No, they're not!

07:54.492 --> 07:57.033
- Catholics?
- Unclear.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.117
Will he practise safe sex?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.325
We're not having sex.

08:02.408 --> 08:04.950
Oh, God. You don't want
another fucking kid.

08:05.033 --> 08:06.158
It's platonic.

08:06.783 --> 08:07.867
You know, I don't...

08:09.075 --> 08:11.658
I've never used a condom.
Never ever.

08:13.033 --> 08:13.992
Nope. Not once.

08:14.033 --> 08:15.783
Well, you should probably
get tested, Mum.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.283
I mean, Dad... fuckin' hell.

08:19.117 --> 08:21.658
Right, I'm gonna go to bed.

08:22.158 --> 08:23.242
I love you, Mum.

08:25.617 --> 08:26.908
I got stoned tonight.

08:27.825 --> 08:30.450
Was it fun? You deserve it,
love. You're lovely.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.700
Even though I feel scared

08:57.658 --> 08:58.908
and angry...

09:02.950 --> 09:04.742
Even though I feel scared
and angry

09:04.825 --> 09:06.158
I still love...

09:07.908 --> 09:11.492
I still love and respect myself.

09:13.242 --> 09:15.492
Love and accept myself.

09:41.742 --> 09:43.117
OK, come on. Listen.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.658
You listening?
This is gonna be a great day...

09:45.742 --> 09:48.033
La-la, la-la...

09:48.075 --> 09:49.117
Are you listening?

09:55.742 --> 09:56.783
Larch.

09:58.450 --> 09:59.533
I love you.

09:59.825 --> 10:00.742
Yeah.

10:01.825 --> 10:03.283
I love you.

10:03.533 --> 10:04.575
Give me a kiss.

10:11.533 --> 10:12.617
Bye!

10:29.075 --> 10:31.075
You look like the Joker, love.

10:31.158 --> 10:32.325
I'm just really happy.

10:33.325 --> 10:34.492
You fuck.

10:38.408 --> 10:39.742
Handy!

10:39.825 --> 10:41.283
- It's Mandy.
- Yeah.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.283
Tall triple-shot soya latte.

10:43.367 --> 10:45.367
- "No fucking foam."
- Is there coffee in that?

10:45.450 --> 10:47.658
- That coffee is almost illegal.
- It's important to me.

10:47.742 --> 10:48.783
Gloria!

10:49.658 --> 10:51.825
- Oh.
- Ah! Shit! Ah...

10:52.158 --> 10:53.492
- Fuck!
- Did you not see me?

10:53.575 --> 10:55.950
- No, I was turned the other way.
- Right, yeah.

10:56.867 --> 10:58.825
- I'm fucking burnt, you know?
- You're fine.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.200
Ugh!

11:01.492 --> 11:02.492
Sorry!

11:03.533 --> 11:05.367
<i>Even though
I'm spineless and tired</i>

11:05.450 --> 11:06.617
<i>I still love and respect myself.</i>

11:06.700 --> 11:08.617
<i>...so old. Even though
I'm old. I'm so old...</i>

11:08.658 --> 11:11.367
<i>Even though I'm shy,
I still love and respect myself.</i>

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
- <i>...love and respect myself.</i>
- <i>Even though I ate the cake</i>

11:15.283 --> 11:17.117
- <i>I still love and respect myself.</i>
- Ah!

11:18.783 --> 11:20.283
Even though I'm clumsy

11:21.158 --> 11:23.700
even though
I'm fucking clumsy and late

11:24.992 --> 11:27.575
I still love and respect myself.

11:28.950 --> 11:30.408
Love and respect myself.

11:30.492 --> 11:32.242
<i>...money, cock, promotion...</i>

11:32.325 --> 11:34.783
I still love and respect myself.

11:34.867 --> 11:36.742
<i>Success,
achievements, progression</i>

11:36.783 --> 11:38.117
<i>money, cock, promotion.</i>

11:39.992 --> 11:41.033
Mandy.

11:44.117 --> 11:45.575
How big do you dream?

11:46.575 --> 11:48.575
The biggest.
You know that.

11:53.617 --> 11:56.117
But are you dreaming
as big as those cats out there?

11:56.200 --> 11:57.408
I like to think so.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.367
Look, I know you have a kid.

12:04.450 --> 12:07.325
We all do, and we know that's both

12:07.408 --> 12:08.700
an enormous advantage

12:08.783 --> 12:11.367
- and a crippling disadvantage.
- It has its moments.

12:11.450 --> 12:14.158
- You're late. Every day.
- Except today.

12:14.242 --> 12:16.283
Your work, your manner.

12:16.367 --> 12:19.325
You're angry, seething. You know
people are calling you Scottish?

12:19.450 --> 12:21.200
- I'm not Scottish.
- You seem it.

12:22.117 --> 12:26.992
But the material... nobody wants
to read about miserable women

12:27.075 --> 12:28.533
because they don't exist.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.283
Nobody cares for old-age saga

12:30.367 --> 12:32.450
because it's terrifying
and vulgar.

12:32.533 --> 12:35.533
It feels... Yeah, it feels
like you're sinking Chardonnay

12:35.617 --> 12:37.825
and running at twilight,
and it's not hot.

12:37.908 --> 12:40.242
And, uh... and you're hot.

12:40.950 --> 12:41.992
Thank you.

12:42.325 --> 12:43.367
Look at me.

12:44.658 --> 12:47.283
No more late arrivals,
no more sad women

12:47.367 --> 12:49.158
- no more miserable conduct.
- OK.

12:59.242 --> 13:00.742
I bet you're great in bed.

13:00.950 --> 13:02.867
Define "letting herself go."

13:02.950 --> 13:04.492
Define "letting herself go."

13:04.575 --> 13:07.825
You get married
to a total babe, yeah?

13:07.950 --> 13:09.825
Perky breasts, a nice firm arse

13:09.908 --> 13:11.242
but she's not perfect, y'know?

13:11.325 --> 13:13.700
Maybe she has a face
shaped like a crescent moon.

13:13.783 --> 13:16.867
- Like a Punch & Judy puppet.
- But she's loyal and spirited.

13:16.950 --> 13:18.908
- Like a collie.
- Yeah, so, it's fine.

13:18.992 --> 13:21.825
Y'know, she's got nice teeth,
she's got, y'know, thick hair

13:21.908 --> 13:24.117
but maybe
just a slight haunch, like.

13:24.242 --> 13:26.908
But whatever, she's pretty
fucking perfect, minus the back.

13:26.992 --> 13:29.867
But, you know,
she's got a high sex drive.

13:29.950 --> 13:31.533
I'm not comfortable
with this tone.

13:31.617 --> 13:34.325
This is a creative space.
A place for confession.

13:34.408 --> 13:35.992
Let's air our grievances.

13:36.075 --> 13:38.158
Men want someone
they can laugh with.

13:38.242 --> 13:40.325
Someone they can sit
in silence with.

13:40.408 --> 13:42.075
Someone they can shit
in front of.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.117
You know, you wanna revel
in their brilliance

13:45.242 --> 13:49.242
and have them remind you
that you are a fuckin' man.

13:49.533 --> 13:51.533
Pete. You're late.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.992
- Uh...
- It's fine.

13:55.492 --> 13:57.158
Uh, big stuff emerging here

13:57.242 --> 13:59.867
can we overlook aesthetic holes
in long-term relationships?

14:00.033 --> 14:01.367
- No.
- Thank you.

14:01.450 --> 14:02.992
We're all getting
uglier and uglier

14:03.075 --> 14:05.242
that's why everything should be
done at the height of romance.

14:05.450 --> 14:06.533
Within reason.

14:07.367 --> 14:08.408
No, without.

14:09.408 --> 14:10.742
Marriage, babies...

14:11.783 --> 14:14.700
babies should be born
in love and thrust

14:14.950 --> 14:15.950
and immediacy.

14:16.283 --> 14:18.367
You know, these days,
we wait and wait

14:18.450 --> 14:20.325
for everything
to align with the stars

14:20.408 --> 14:22.908
and it just...
it doesn't happen.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.575
And you're not in love anymore,
and you're both uglier now

14:25.658 --> 14:27.450
and guess what? She's infertile.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.200
And you can't help
but lose respect for her

14:29.283 --> 14:30.825
cos that was her thing.

14:30.867 --> 14:32.242
Fundamentally,
that was the one thing

14:32.367 --> 14:34.908
she could do ahead of me...
ahead of us

14:34.992 --> 14:36.367
and that's
what made her special.

14:36.450 --> 14:38.908
And now I can't smell the...

14:40.033 --> 14:42.367
I-I-I can't see the...

14:44.658 --> 14:45.700
smile.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.408
Yeah, they've commissioned it.

15:22.492 --> 15:25.158
I mean, it's one of the dreams.
As you know, I have many.

15:25.242 --> 15:27.492
I mean, it's a chain
around my neck if I'm honest

15:27.575 --> 15:28.783
but a welcome one.

15:29.617 --> 15:31.158
You saw that in <i>The Guardian?</i>

15:31.700 --> 15:32.950
In <i>The Guardian?</i>

15:33.033 --> 15:34.700
Didn't know
it was in <i>The Guardian.</i>

15:34.867 --> 15:36.075
Googlealert?

15:36.533 --> 15:38.242
Come on, Dad. That's gross.

15:39.367 --> 15:41.658
I didn't know what it means
to be on the board.

15:41.742 --> 15:42.867
My name on a chair.

15:42.950 --> 15:44.200
Wouldn't that be amazing?

15:44.575 --> 15:45.700
Yeah, Larch is fine.

15:45.783 --> 15:47.658
Larch is fine. I love him.

15:47.950 --> 15:49.533
I think he'll be
into aviation, you know

15:49.617 --> 15:52.408
he just loves things with wings.

15:52.492 --> 15:55.117
I dunno, I think we all worry
we're raising psychopaths.

15:55.367 --> 15:57.658
Plane-spotting?

15:58.033 --> 16:00.283
Plane-spotting.
That would be amazing, Dad.

16:01.242 --> 16:04.658
I mean, that would...
that would really be something.

16:16.617 --> 16:17.658
Yeah.

16:17.992 --> 16:18.992
So...

16:19.992 --> 16:22.575
we're lying there
and things are progressing

16:22.658 --> 16:25.867
and his head is moving its way
down my torso

16:25.992 --> 16:27.867
and I feel anxious.

16:27.992 --> 16:29.450
- Naturally.
- Naturally.

16:29.700 --> 16:32.408
And out of the blue,
I feel like I have to comment

16:32.492 --> 16:34.075
on the good state of my vagina.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.367
- Because he knows I have a baby.
- Of eight months.

16:36.492 --> 16:37.533
Of eight mon...

16:38.325 --> 16:39.325
- Of eight months.
- Yeah.

16:39.408 --> 16:41.575
So he might be curious, y'know

16:41.658 --> 16:46.158
and his ex
had third-degree lacerations.

16:46.242 --> 16:48.242
- Fuck.
- Literally front to back.

16:48.325 --> 16:50.158
That's just a big hole.

16:50.283 --> 16:52.283
There's no coming back
from that.

16:52.367 --> 16:53.950
- No.
- Just a hole.

16:54.033 --> 16:55.992
- Vaginal prolapse...
- Anyway, uh.

16:56.075 --> 16:59.867
I say,
"My vagina's really tight."

17:00.242 --> 17:01.825
Informative. Reassuring.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.200
- It's in really good nick.
- Like a car?

17:05.575 --> 17:07.158
- I go on.
- Mm.

17:07.491 --> 17:09.158
"I had a C-section, see?"

17:09.283 --> 17:12.033
And he's like,
"Oh, cool. Show me."

17:12.825 --> 17:13.991
- Mm?
- Shh.

17:19.533 --> 17:21.575
- So I show him my scar, right?
- Yeah.

17:21.658 --> 17:22.783
And he starts kissing it.

17:22.866 --> 17:25.283
And he starts licking it,
and I'm like...

17:25.366 --> 17:26.866
It's still raw down there,
y'know?

17:26.950 --> 17:28.408
I have very little sensation.

17:28.533 --> 17:31.367
And he carries on, he's like,
"Oh, I love this scar.

17:31.492 --> 17:33.825
Oh, you brought life
into the world through this

17:33.908 --> 17:35.992
it's so natural. So yummy."

17:36.075 --> 17:38.242
- It's barbaric.
- And I just wanna say to him

17:38.325 --> 17:39.950
"Yeah, it wasn't
your fucking child

17:40.033 --> 17:41.950
that came out of this wall,
it was Nick's."

17:42.033 --> 17:43.950
He was there to witness it.

17:44.033 --> 17:46.533
And this bloke
is getting over-sentimental

17:46.575 --> 17:49.575
about some other man's child
during <i>our</i> sex.

17:49.658 --> 17:52.075
- Yeah.
- And it makes me feel sick.

17:52.617 --> 17:55.783
And sad. Because I miss Nick.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.950
- Really?
- And I can't believe...

17:58.033 --> 17:59.117
Fuck Nick.

17:59.575 --> 18:02.242
Who cries on coke!

18:02.450 --> 18:03.492
Come on.

18:03.700 --> 18:04.783
Thank you.

18:21.950 --> 18:22.992
Stop it.

18:23.825 --> 18:24.908
Stop it.

18:24.992 --> 18:26.617
Just try and stop blinking.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.200
Sorry.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.575
I love you.

18:34.950 --> 18:36.658
I missed you today.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.117
Your breath smells.

18:40.325 --> 18:43.033
Why don't they just
put the fucker down?

18:43.242 --> 18:45.367
Vic's here.

18:54.283 --> 18:56.575
- Alright, Mand?
- Alright, Dad.

18:58.783 --> 18:59.825
New van?

19:01.033 --> 19:02.033
No.

19:02.492 --> 19:04.158
- Lager?
- No, not for me.

19:05.658 --> 19:06.783
Suit yourself.

19:07.908 --> 19:09.242
It's a right fucking mess
in here.

19:09.283 --> 19:11.825
- He made it, then.
- Yeah. He's going to Thailand.

19:11.908 --> 19:14.242
- Is he?
- I hope he fucks a ladyboy.

19:14.908 --> 19:18.033
Larch had a good day at school.
No kicking chickens.

19:18.742 --> 19:19.908
Small breakthroughs.

19:21.658 --> 19:24.575
- I got chips and curry sauce!
- Oh, I hate curry...

19:33.075 --> 19:35.200
Alright, Larchy, that's great.
Come on, get to bed.

19:36.117 --> 19:38.908
- Stop that.
- Dad, you'll make it worse.

19:45.242 --> 19:48.575
- Let's go. Off.
- Go on, Larchy, get outta here.

19:59.158 --> 20:01.408
- Vic...
- Vic, I need somewhere to live.

20:02.325 --> 20:05.075
- She needs somewhere to live.
- It's been six years.

20:05.158 --> 20:06.658
She raised your fucking family.

20:06.742 --> 20:08.742
She left me.

20:10.325 --> 20:12.450
- It was a good life.
- It was a shit life.

20:12.533 --> 20:14.908
- It was a tribute to your life.
- I never kept you, Marion

20:14.992 --> 20:17.033
I never limited you,
I gave you a mile

20:17.075 --> 20:18.200
you never took an inch.

20:18.242 --> 20:20.450
You had no initiative,
you had no great ambition.

20:20.533 --> 20:21.783
I had dreams.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.367
- No, I had no ambition. No.
- Tell you what I'll do

20:24.575 --> 20:26.617
I'll give you all my money

20:26.700 --> 20:27.742
and my house

20:27.783 --> 20:29.617
and I'll lodge with you,
and I'll pay you

20:29.658 --> 20:30.658
to cook and clean.

20:30.742 --> 20:33.492
It'll be just like the old days,
won't it? Eh?

20:39.408 --> 20:40.450
It's lit.

20:41.742 --> 20:43.075
It's lit.

20:47.408 --> 20:49.700
When the house is sold,
you can have your half

20:49.783 --> 20:51.950
the better half,
the larger fucking half

20:51.992 --> 20:54.075
you'll have something to show
for the fruits of your labour.

20:54.158 --> 20:55.783
I'm sorry you were so miserable,
by the way.

20:55.825 --> 20:57.075
I'm sorry
it was so fucking awful.

20:57.158 --> 20:58.908
I would've stayed
if you hadn't made me believe

20:58.992 --> 21:00.950
- I was losing my mind.
- Bollocks!

21:02.408 --> 21:04.325
Now, I'll give you an advance
on the house

21:04.408 --> 21:06.283
when I can scrape
something together.

21:07.117 --> 21:09.450
The balance
from your trip to Asia

21:09.617 --> 21:11.950
oh, you fucking soul seeker.

21:12.117 --> 21:14.575
Self-improvement, Marion.
Self-improvement.

21:14.658 --> 21:16.533
Enlightenment.
Guarantees happiness.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.825
Ask her. Ask Mandy.

21:17.908 --> 21:19.617
- Mm.
- You're happy, ain't ya?

21:20.658 --> 21:21.992
- Mm.
- There you go.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.867
- Where's Vic going?
- Back to his fucking castle!

21:33.325 --> 21:34.742
He's crazy.

21:48.075 --> 21:49.242
Are you stressed?

21:49.325 --> 21:52.533
I'm just hot,
and my bloody hands are swelling

21:52.617 --> 21:54.283
like I've got gout or something.

21:54.783 --> 21:56.117
Why are you doing scary make-up?

21:56.200 --> 21:58.825
Does it look scary?
It's supposed to look smoky.

21:59.158 --> 22:00.992
- Like a witch?
- Do I look like a witch?

22:01.075 --> 22:02.367
- Yeah.
- Right, well...

22:03.450 --> 22:04.825
I'll just take it off, then.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.742
Right, come on.
This is our next stop.

22:08.908 --> 22:10.783
- Can you put your hair up?
- Can I just wear it down?

22:10.867 --> 22:12.533
I just wanna...
I just wanna wear it down.

22:13.867 --> 22:16.117
Let's go. Come on.

22:20.158 --> 22:21.200
Come on. Quick, quick!

22:30.867 --> 22:32.992
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

22:34.492 --> 22:35.700
Welcome to my life.

22:40.367 --> 22:41.408
Be yourself.

22:42.242 --> 22:43.825
Stop... stop that, Larch.

22:44.033 --> 22:46.575
He... Don't, just... He's fine.

22:47.992 --> 22:50.658
You shouldn't hurt them, Larch,
they won't wanna be your friend.

22:51.575 --> 22:54.825
Oh, er... I'm Pete.

22:55.283 --> 22:58.283
And I love being around
your mum.

23:00.075 --> 23:02.283
Bit strange, that.
Bit assertive.

23:02.408 --> 23:04.575
He responds
to more gentle teachings.

23:06.367 --> 23:08.783
Well, I'm a man, so he's
unlikely to get that from me.

23:08.825 --> 23:10.533
- Don't be contrary.
- Don't be controlling.

23:10.617 --> 23:12.658
Are we about to have
a row in front of my son?

23:13.325 --> 23:14.658
He doesn't give a fuck.

23:14.742 --> 23:16.450
Look, he's off kicking pigeons.

23:16.533 --> 23:18.658
Maybe we should focus on that.
What's he doing that for?

23:18.742 --> 23:20.658
Letting off some
seven-year-old steam?

23:21.033 --> 23:22.742
And treat that twitching thing.

23:26.617 --> 23:28.408
- What's wrong? Are you crying?
- No.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.992
How to comfort a crying woman,
uh, should I...

23:33.992 --> 23:35.492
I dunno, show you some money?

23:35.783 --> 23:38.367
Or business card with your
name on it? Do you need

23:38.450 --> 23:40.575
- to make yourself come?
- I cry once a month.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.033
Oh, God,
are we talking about bleeding?

23:44.075 --> 23:45.200
You're a bleeder?

23:46.492 --> 23:47.742
That's rare.

24:03.950 --> 24:05.575
- Does that hurt?
- No.

24:07.450 --> 24:09.492
- It's actually quite nice.
- OK.

24:13.783 --> 24:15.533
Have I got make-up
all over my face?

24:15.617 --> 24:17.658
I've never seen you
wear so much makeup.

24:17.742 --> 24:19.533
I like it.
Your face can take it.

24:19.783 --> 24:20.783
Thanks.

24:57.950 --> 25:00.450
Is it on you?
Oh, it's all in your hair.

25:01.242 --> 25:03.033
- Come on, just say "Hi" to them.
- Go on.

25:03.117 --> 25:04.908
- Come on.
- It's OK.

25:05.117 --> 25:06.908
- Brilliant, aren't they?
- See? Yay.

25:06.992 --> 25:08.700
- They're awesome, I love them.
- Why're you scared?

25:08.783 --> 25:10.200
Come on, just get in there.

25:10.283 --> 25:12.200
- Come on!
- OK, maybe don't push him.

25:12.283 --> 25:13.658
- Hi.
- See? Yay.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.117
Hey. Oh, look,
they've got one of those...

25:15.200 --> 25:17.200
See? Mum's not scared. Yay.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.825
Oh, my God!

25:19.200 --> 25:20.408
Pick a card!

25:20.492 --> 25:21.658
Go on.

25:23.283 --> 25:25.200
Let's have a look?
What's that one, Pete?

25:25.325 --> 25:27.242
- It's a spade.
- Is this your card?

25:30.033 --> 25:32.867
Oh, Larch. Sorry. I'm so sorry.

25:33.283 --> 25:34.908
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.033
Sorry.

25:40.283 --> 25:41.533
What a great hat.

25:42.617 --> 25:43.825
The doughnut!

25:44.408 --> 25:45.992
- Mum!
- Thank you so much.

25:46.075 --> 25:47.450
- The doughnut, Mum!
- What doughnut?

25:47.533 --> 25:49.950
- Mum, the bloody doughnut!
- What doughnut?

25:50.492 --> 25:52.950
- Doughnut!
- I'll just get you one of these.

25:54.367 --> 25:56.242
- Larch, have another. Look.
- We'll get a different one.

25:56.325 --> 25:58.533
- We'll get one of them.
- Who's that? It's an alligator.

25:58.617 --> 26:00.492
Have a rocket, or something.

26:00.783 --> 26:02.492
Larch, get off the floor.
What're you doing?

26:02.658 --> 26:04.658
- Off the floor.
- Mandy, he can have a rock...

26:04.700 --> 26:06.408
- No, get up.
- Look, will you get up?

26:06.492 --> 26:08.908
Larch!

26:09.658 --> 26:12.075
- I'll get you another.
- They're all rubbish.

26:12.158 --> 26:14.575
Can you do something?
This is embarrassing.

26:14.658 --> 26:15.742
You're embarrassing yourself.

26:18.325 --> 26:19.825
Put your fucking phone away.

26:19.908 --> 26:22.200
- Stop filming me!
- Fucking paedophile.

26:22.283 --> 26:23.658
- What are you looking at?
- Mandy!

26:23.742 --> 26:25.242
- Get up.
- Stop filming me!

26:25.408 --> 26:27.367
- Larch, that's enough.
- It's none of your business!

26:27.450 --> 26:29.200
Go away. Go away.

26:29.367 --> 26:30.533
Go away, Pete...

26:30.783 --> 26:32.200
You're embarrassing yourself.

26:32.242 --> 26:33.783
- You're embarrassing us.
- I don't care!

26:33.867 --> 26:35.992
I care.

26:36.075 --> 26:38.033
Don't you laugh at me.
He's laughing at me.

26:38.533 --> 26:40.867
- I hate you!
- Can you help me, please?

27:16.575 --> 27:17.950
What a great day.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.242
Sorry about the screaming.

27:21.033 --> 27:22.658
Pete seemed so stressed

27:22.742 --> 27:24.700
but I got my twitching down
by 10%.

27:24.783 --> 27:26.575
- What twitching?
- Yeah.

27:27.075 --> 27:29.825
Don't forget to charge the iPad.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.200
Alright.

27:42.450 --> 27:44.992
Goodnight, my darling.
Such a good boy.

27:46.742 --> 27:48.492
I love you so much it hurts.

27:48.575 --> 27:50.408
I don't like it
when you say that.

27:53.283 --> 27:56.033
Yeah, sorry, I always...
I always forget that.

28:11.033 --> 28:12.242
Goodnight, my darling.

28:12.325 --> 28:13.408
Love you.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.533
I found some booze.

28:23.617 --> 28:24.742
Brilliant.

28:25.533 --> 28:27.158
You have a lot of condiments
in your fridge.

28:27.242 --> 28:28.492
Yeah. We like sauce.

28:28.950 --> 28:30.658
End of terrace,
cul-de-sac salad cream.

28:30.742 --> 28:31.700
Sure.

28:32.658 --> 28:33.700
You alright?

28:36.658 --> 28:37.992
Yeah, I mean...

28:40.658 --> 28:43.950
I was confident
that you were not the paedophile

28:44.033 --> 28:45.158
I once imagined

28:45.242 --> 28:48.158
and that you would leave
our company swooning with love

28:48.242 --> 28:49.742
and then
I would reject that love

28:49.783 --> 28:51.033
and be on top of the world...

28:51.117 --> 28:52.575
Stop talking. Show me your body.

28:53.158 --> 28:55.283
Oh, right, I'll just apologise
for my son's behaviour

28:55.367 --> 28:56.742
by sucking you off, shall I?

28:56.825 --> 28:58.117
No, I'm OK, thank you.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.242
I'm hideous, I warn you.

29:00.450 --> 29:02.742
- Oh, please.
- Mm! Alright.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.658
Just let me do it for you, OK?

29:05.742 --> 29:06.825
Don't come at me

29:06.908 --> 29:09.742
like some fucking smooth,
shiny dolphin.

29:09.825 --> 29:12.117
- None of that.
- OK, OK. Fucking hell.

29:15.283 --> 29:19.492
I want to unveil myself to you
one piece at a time, OK?

29:19.575 --> 29:21.533
So I can get used to you
seeing me naked

29:21.575 --> 29:23.158
and so that
I can talk you through

29:23.242 --> 29:25.408
what I physically hate
about myself.

29:25.908 --> 29:27.408
I don't know what to say.

29:29.950 --> 29:30.950
Woo!

29:31.492 --> 29:32.533
OK.

29:39.950 --> 29:41.492
These are my breasts.

29:41.575 --> 29:43.575
And this is what they look like
when I'm, like

29:44.200 --> 29:45.200
posing and stuff.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.200
And then,
this is what they look like

29:47.242 --> 29:49.117
when I'm, like, writing,
or just, like

29:49.617 --> 29:51.242
eating a sandwich or something.

29:51.283 --> 29:52.783
You look like
you've swallowed a square.

29:52.867 --> 29:54.658
And those boobs
should definitely be bigger

29:54.700 --> 29:56.117
to make sense
of that back of yours.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.242
Exactly.
That's exactly what I think.

30:03.367 --> 30:04.533
OK, these are my...

30:06.033 --> 30:07.408
These are my thighs.

30:08.367 --> 30:11.117
The problem is actually
my femurs, you know.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.283
They're just too long.

30:12.367 --> 30:14.950
Just too much femur,
not enough tibia.

30:16.450 --> 30:17.492
My feet.

30:18.575 --> 30:20.408
Fuck,
that's nail-thickening disease.

30:20.492 --> 30:21.992
You should get
all those nails removed.

30:22.033 --> 30:23.533
Just take off all my toenails?

30:23.617 --> 30:25.325
So it's just nail bed.

30:28.742 --> 30:30.200
This is my caesarean scar.

30:30.325 --> 30:31.825
Ah!

30:31.908 --> 30:32.992
Argh!

30:33.325 --> 30:34.950
It's actually, uh...

30:35.158 --> 30:38.283
- it's not that bad.
- Please never, never touch it.

30:38.367 --> 30:41.075
I would never touch that.
It still looks a bit angry.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.825
Well, I could
make it up for you.

30:42.908 --> 30:45.325
Yeah, something that counteracts
the red and purple.

30:47.575 --> 30:50.533
OK, I'm gonna show you something
really special, alright?

30:52.367 --> 30:55.033
It's in...
It's in really good shape

30:55.117 --> 30:56.992
and I feel like
once I've shown you this

30:57.200 --> 30:59.908
there will be
no flies on me, OK?

30:59.992 --> 31:03.033
I will have totally and physically
exposed myself to you

31:03.117 --> 31:04.450
and I will have owned it.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.700
This is my arsehole.

31:23.242 --> 31:24.325
Do you like it?

31:26.408 --> 31:28.075
I mean, me. Do you like me?

31:40.117 --> 31:41.283
Fucking bags!

31:41.617 --> 31:43.700
Angry bags, all over me.

31:44.867 --> 31:46.825
- You alright, Mum?
- I'm sad.

31:47.825 --> 31:48.825
And mad.

31:51.283 --> 31:52.325
Pete's here.

31:58.867 --> 31:59.950
Pete.

32:01.867 --> 32:02.908
Marion.

32:03.325 --> 32:04.575
Just came back for my HRT.

32:04.617 --> 32:06.325
- I'll be gone in...
- It's alright, Mum.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.200
- You stayed?
- Yes.

32:08.283 --> 32:09.783
How long?
How long you staying for?

32:09.867 --> 32:11.825
- Indefinitely.
- He's joking. He'll be off soon.

32:11.908 --> 32:14.950
- I'll have breakfast first.
- We don't eat breakfast here.

32:22.617 --> 32:24.200
I hear you're religious?

32:24.283 --> 32:25.408
Nothing to be scared of.

32:25.533 --> 32:28.825
Well, we're atheists here, Pete.
It's put us in good stead.

32:28.908 --> 32:29.950
Has it?

32:51.283 --> 32:52.742
- I wanna take her away.
- No.

32:52.825 --> 32:54.367
- Hrm.
- I mean yes.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.075
- What about work?
- What about Larch?

32:57.158 --> 32:58.700
- Larch too.
- Really?

32:58.783 --> 33:01.325
My friend, Cressida, you know,
Cressida from Development?

33:01.658 --> 33:02.617
Not by face.

33:04.033 --> 33:05.367
She's an old family friend.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.200
She's getting married.
She's very likeable.

33:07.283 --> 33:08.367
I think we should go.

33:08.450 --> 33:11.283
We should go
and watch people being happy.

33:18.075 --> 33:19.617
How long will it take us?

33:19.700 --> 33:21.867
- Watch it. Out the way.
- Will the airport be busy?

33:21.950 --> 33:24.117
You never tell me! I won't sit
next to other children

33:24.200 --> 33:25.283
you know that.

33:25.575 --> 33:26.533
What?

33:28.533 --> 33:29.742
Ugh. OK, alright.

33:29.825 --> 33:30.992
Is there wi-fi?

33:33.408 --> 33:35.367
I'm talking to you, you know!

33:36.992 --> 33:38.992
- Right, that's it. I'm not going.
- Larch!

33:39.992 --> 33:41.033
Urgh!

33:41.825 --> 33:43.450
- Larch, come on!
- I'm not going!

33:43.950 --> 33:46.117
- No, no, no.
- Out the house. Come on.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.033
- Come on.
- You're hurting me, Mum.

33:49.117 --> 33:50.450
You're being violent.

33:51.867 --> 33:54.325
- You're hurting me, Mum.
- I'm not hurting you.

33:54.783 --> 33:55.742
Fuck!

34:00.700 --> 34:01.742
Can we go?

34:02.367 --> 34:03.450
Can we go?

34:04.033 --> 34:05.658
It's not the end
of the world, Mum.

34:05.742 --> 34:08.408
It is the end of the world.
Actually, it is.

34:15.492 --> 34:17.075
Did you remember my iPad?

34:17.200 --> 34:18.950
Did you remember my iPad, Mum?

34:19.742 --> 34:20.950
Answer the question.

34:22.158 --> 34:23.283
Answer the question.

34:23.367 --> 34:24.908
- I think...
- Not think.

34:24.992 --> 34:26.742
- I'm sure...
- How sure? How sure?

34:26.908 --> 34:28.117
Um, 48%?

34:28.200 --> 34:29.908
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

34:33.367 --> 34:34.408
Hi.

34:40.075 --> 34:41.033
No.

34:41.117 --> 34:42.742
No, no, no.
We are not going back.

34:42.825 --> 34:43.908
We're not going back.

34:43.992 --> 34:45.283
Look, Pete's got one.

34:45.367 --> 34:46.492
Pete's got one.

34:51.117 --> 34:52.658
It's 32% charged.

34:54.283 --> 34:55.408
It's the wrong model.

34:55.450 --> 34:57.783
- Does it have augmented reality?
- No, no. None of that.

34:57.867 --> 34:59.283
OK. Can we go, please?

35:15.117 --> 35:17.033
- Say, "Thank you."
- It's fine.

35:19.700 --> 35:20.950
I'm freezing.

35:21.033 --> 35:22.783
It's fucking fine. Jesus.

35:51.117 --> 35:53.242
Just so you know, you'll be
the only atheist in there.

35:53.325 --> 35:54.367
Don't let it unnerve you.

35:54.408 --> 35:56.617
It's fine. It's very hard
to feel anything but sorry

35:56.658 --> 35:58.075
for the clinically insane.

35:58.408 --> 35:59.492
You seem anxious.

35:59.950 --> 36:00.992
I'm anxious.

36:01.533 --> 36:04.617
Well bloody done! You made it.

36:05.117 --> 36:07.908
Lovers in transit.
Awfully testing.

36:08.658 --> 36:10.283
Pete, you look awful.

36:10.450 --> 36:12.283
- You look ill.
- Let there be wine.

36:12.367 --> 36:13.367
Mandy.

36:13.492 --> 36:15.283
Mandy, you are stunning.

36:15.367 --> 36:16.783
He said that you were,
and you are.

36:16.867 --> 36:17.950
Thank you.

36:18.033 --> 36:19.242
I love your hair.

36:19.325 --> 36:20.950
It's very hard
to work the pixie

36:21.033 --> 36:22.825
but you have
the most gifted jaw.

36:22.908 --> 36:23.867
I'm Vanessa.

36:23.950 --> 36:25.492
And this is Evelyn, and Becky.

36:25.575 --> 36:26.867
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hey. Hi.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.658
- This must be Larch.
- Little sister.

36:28.742 --> 36:30.575
You're at death's door.
An eating disorder for sure.

36:30.617 --> 36:32.908
Mum, it's time for an
intervention. You'll die, Pete.

36:32.992 --> 36:34.867
You'll die on the street
under a flickering light.

36:34.950 --> 36:35.992
- Mumma.
- Hi.

36:36.075 --> 36:38.117
Was it awful?
How are you, darling?

36:38.242 --> 36:40.825
Mandy, lovely to meet you.
We've heard a lot about you

36:40.908 --> 36:42.492
and your full-bodied plans.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.242
- Plans?
- Marital plans.

36:44.325 --> 36:45.325
OK.

36:45.783 --> 36:47.575
Is that your son over there,
kicking our dog?

36:47.658 --> 36:50.117
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- He's an angry little thing.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.158
Mandy, I'm Bertie.
Short for "Richard."

36:52.283 --> 36:53.533
Thrilled to have you here.

36:53.617 --> 36:55.450
And Pete is very happy.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.283
Let's eat and talk.

36:57.367 --> 36:58.533
- Do you like to talk?
- Yes.

36:58.575 --> 36:59.492
Come on.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.200
Shall we?

37:09.742 --> 37:11.242
Let us...

37:12.408 --> 37:15.367
Let us give thanks
for these great gifts

37:15.450 --> 37:16.992
of delicious food and wine.

37:18.533 --> 37:20.742
Let us remember
how fortunate we are

37:21.200 --> 37:22.408
to enjoy them

37:22.783 --> 37:25.658
and how blessed we are

37:26.575 --> 37:28.533
to share in the great love

37:29.617 --> 37:30.908
around this table.

37:31.700 --> 37:34.283
For all this,
we give great thanks.

37:34.825 --> 37:36.617
- Amen.
- Amen.

37:37.117 --> 37:38.533
So your mother lives with you?

37:38.950 --> 37:41.283
- Yeah.
- Inspiring.

37:42.492 --> 37:44.617
- You know, the Jews...
- Don't mention the Jews.

37:44.742 --> 37:46.700
The Jews got it right.

37:46.867 --> 37:48.825
We all need a kibbutz situation

37:48.992 --> 37:50.742
put the children
in separate houses

37:50.825 --> 37:53.617
and let us go about our work
and honour our husbands.

37:55.242 --> 37:57.075
So, what do you make of Pete?

37:57.158 --> 37:58.742
Do you want to settle with him?

37:59.075 --> 38:00.617
Make him your owner?

38:01.033 --> 38:03.408
"Owner" feels a bit strong.

38:03.492 --> 38:04.742
I barely know Pete.

38:04.825 --> 38:07.367
Larch's father,
does he make an appearance?

38:08.492 --> 38:11.158
You don't need time
to know Pete.

38:11.242 --> 38:13.575
- Pete's a boring cunt.
- Everything you see today

38:13.658 --> 38:14.908
is everything he is.

38:15.742 --> 38:17.408
It's a strength and a weakness.

38:17.533 --> 38:18.908
I'll never be surprised by him.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.658
Surprises can be devastating.

38:20.742 --> 38:21.783
Mandy?

38:21.867 --> 38:23.158
Yeah, sorry, um...

38:23.742 --> 38:26.200
Well, his father had, like...

38:26.367 --> 38:29.783
Sorry, it's just really hard
to talk with him over there.

38:29.867 --> 38:31.700
Great that Larch is here today.

38:32.158 --> 38:33.533
Blinking away over there.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.117
- What is that?
- Well, when he's anxious...

38:36.200 --> 38:37.533
Which is all the time, so...

38:37.617 --> 38:39.367
Well, Pete's a mess.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.117
- Shut up.
- Oh, right. Well, me too.

38:42.492 --> 38:44.450
Me too. And I'm angry.

38:45.117 --> 38:48.408
I'm organised,
but I'm fucking furious.

38:49.158 --> 38:51.658
Do you know,
I have to get high

38:52.450 --> 38:54.117
just to talk to my husband?

38:54.492 --> 38:55.992
Really high.

38:56.617 --> 38:58.325
It's like therapy for us.

38:58.575 --> 39:00.700
- Well, what about God?
- Oh, God?

39:01.700 --> 39:02.992
- Yes. Of course.
- Mandy.

39:03.117 --> 39:04.367
I mean, he's harder to access

39:04.450 --> 39:05.658
- than a bag of coke.
- Mandy.

39:05.742 --> 39:07.867
- But I couldn't do a thing...
- Mandy, the boy. Is he...

39:07.950 --> 39:10.242
- Alright in the head?
- He means "a mistake."

39:11.325 --> 39:13.742
- Well, I wasn't gonna abort him.
- No, no. Horrible.

39:13.908 --> 39:16.158
Not after
two terminations prior.

39:17.617 --> 39:19.617
That's three terminations
between you.

39:19.742 --> 39:21.908
- They deserve each other.
- Live on an island

39:21.992 --> 39:23.825
dancing around my flag.

39:23.908 --> 39:25.950
Who would I have
to thank for life?

39:26.033 --> 39:27.033
Myself?

39:27.117 --> 39:28.783
That's an awful lot...

39:28.867 --> 39:30.492
Self-congratulating.

39:30.825 --> 39:33.367
I can't love Mike without God.

39:33.950 --> 39:36.200
I can't live every day
without thinking

39:36.283 --> 39:37.992
somebody had a plan.

39:43.450 --> 39:45.158
Sorry. Sorry.

39:47.783 --> 39:49.117
I didn't know about...

39:49.408 --> 39:50.450
What?

39:51.033 --> 39:52.200
The abortion.

39:53.617 --> 39:55.867
Well, nor did I
until afterwards, so...

39:56.950 --> 39:58.533
- Sorry.
- Classic Pete.

39:58.658 --> 40:00.908
Mindless Pete,
hopelessly thumbing it in

40:01.033 --> 40:02.742
impregnating some old sow.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.867
Some 50-year-old...

40:07.492 --> 40:08.533
Oh, God!

40:09.033 --> 40:10.242
Oh, darling...

40:10.533 --> 40:11.867
Well done, Pete.

40:11.992 --> 40:13.617
Every single dinner...

40:17.242 --> 40:19.950
- Should we go after him?
- No, just ignore him.

40:50.992 --> 40:54.033
Husbands should love their wives

40:54.158 --> 40:56.783
just as Christ loved his church

40:57.200 --> 40:58.825
and sacrificed himself

40:59.492 --> 41:00.617
to keep her holy.

41:01.325 --> 41:04.283
He made her clean
by washing her in water

41:04.367 --> 41:05.617
with a form of words.

41:06.408 --> 41:08.658
So that when he took her
for himself

41:08.950 --> 41:10.283
she would be glorious.

41:10.408 --> 41:14.450
With no speck or wrinkle,
or anything like that

41:14.825 --> 41:16.575
but holy and faultless.

41:17.408 --> 41:20.992
In the same way,
a husband should love his wife

41:21.283 --> 41:23.908
as much as he loves
his own body.

41:24.658 --> 41:26.492
For a man to love his wife

41:26.825 --> 41:29.075
is for him to love himself.

41:29.867 --> 41:31.908
A man must never hate
his own body

41:32.700 --> 41:35.617
but must feed it
and look after it

41:35.783 --> 41:37.575
as Christ treats his church

41:37.700 --> 41:39.492
because it is his body

41:39.575 --> 41:41.450
and we are all living parts!

41:43.117 --> 41:44.908
When man and woman wed

41:45.533 --> 41:47.783
they become one body.

41:50.283 --> 41:51.408
In summary

41:51.908 --> 41:55.075
let every one of you
love your wives

41:55.158 --> 41:57.200
as much as you love yourself.

41:58.158 --> 41:59.867
And let every wife

42:00.617 --> 42:03.742
respect your husband!

42:14.408 --> 42:16.450
Well, you chose it,
so you're stuck with it.

42:16.533 --> 42:18.117
- So, it is what it is.
- Alright.

42:19.533 --> 42:20.533
It's fine.

42:21.533 --> 42:22.617
Call that a dress?

42:22.950 --> 42:24.200
Built for the bedroom, no?

42:24.283 --> 42:25.450
She's very sexy.

42:25.742 --> 42:27.450
Kinda woman
you wanna breed with.

42:27.533 --> 42:30.033
Look at Cressida,
and all you can see is milk.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.617
Why don't you fuck her, then?

42:32.783 --> 42:33.950
Sorry. Sorry.

42:34.367 --> 42:36.367
- Oh, you fruits!
- You fruits!

42:36.908 --> 42:37.992
Welcome.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.033
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:42.908 --> 42:44.658
Stealing our light.
We're rotting here.

42:44.742 --> 42:45.700
You're a vision.

42:45.783 --> 42:47.117
Hm. Suspicious dress, darling.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.742
Not as suspicious
as that sermon.

42:48.825 --> 42:50.325
Ruffled a few feathers,
I'm sure.

42:50.450 --> 42:51.867
- Who chose that?
- Oh, me.

42:51.950 --> 42:52.950
Oh!

42:52.992 --> 42:56.325
I know. I'm what you call
a post-post-post-feminist.

42:56.408 --> 42:58.700
- Just an original women.
- Oh, Mandy.

42:58.783 --> 43:00.200
How do you find the smothering?

43:00.283 --> 43:01.992
Not as bad
as the hateful honesty.

43:02.408 --> 43:05.075
Mandy, this guy...
these guys... this guy

43:05.533 --> 43:06.617
hellbent on love.

43:06.700 --> 43:08.825
I hope his penis
is as big as his heart.

43:08.992 --> 43:10.075
Oh, perfect!

43:10.950 --> 43:12.408
Y'know, take care of him, Mandy

43:12.450 --> 43:15.158
- he's a delicate flower, really.
- You're making her sick now.

43:15.242 --> 43:17.367
It's hard to see that
sometimes, I know

43:17.450 --> 43:19.908
but that...
that's our gift as women

43:20.033 --> 43:22.783
we can see through
all that arrogance and rage.

43:22.950 --> 43:25.700
But don't love light

43:25.867 --> 43:27.367
and weaken our brand.

45:35.533 --> 45:36.867
There's nothing else!

45:37.492 --> 45:38.533
There's nothing else!

45:39.367 --> 45:40.408
There's nothing else!

45:41.283 --> 45:42.367
There's nothing else!

45:43.325 --> 45:44.408
There's nothing else!

45:45.158 --> 45:46.117
There's nothing else!

45:47.117 --> 45:48.200
There's nothing else!

45:48.950 --> 45:50.075
There's nothing else!

46:45.992 --> 46:47.825
You should choose the heavy one.

46:47.908 --> 46:49.492
No, no, not the fat one.

46:49.575 --> 46:50.867
Fat one won't go anywhere.

46:50.992 --> 46:52.700
Always thin. Thin is best.

46:53.658 --> 46:54.658
Yes.

46:59.533 --> 47:01.408
Mandy?

47:05.158 --> 47:07.742
Ugh. You look drunk!

47:08.617 --> 47:10.783
- What're you doing here?
- What're you doing here?

47:10.867 --> 47:12.242
It's not a competition.

47:13.075 --> 47:15.408
I'm working with Cressida.
We're in a co-pro situation.

47:15.492 --> 47:16.533
Wasteful piece of shit.

47:16.617 --> 47:18.992
I'm based in LA now.
Did you know that?

47:19.075 --> 47:20.117
Yeah, the accent.

47:20.200 --> 47:23.158
Between you and I,
we used to fuck, Cressida and I.

47:23.242 --> 47:24.992
...fucking die, Mum? Mum!

47:25.742 --> 47:26.825
Your son?

47:26.908 --> 47:28.075
The son of a fishwife.

47:28.158 --> 47:30.283
Boy, do you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

47:37.575 --> 47:39.450
Mandy, Larch, let's dance.

47:44.825 --> 47:45.950
Uh...

47:47.033 --> 47:48.075
Ah.

47:52.408 --> 47:54.033
You look like a monkey.

47:55.283 --> 47:56.742
So everybody says.

47:58.075 --> 48:01.617
Your eyes are too close
together. Like Granddad's.

48:02.825 --> 48:04.492
- Like an owl?
- Like an owl.

48:04.950 --> 48:06.867
Exactly. A predatory bird.

48:06.950 --> 48:07.992
Cool.

48:08.075 --> 48:09.075
Ooh!

48:12.575 --> 48:13.825
What do you think, Larch?

48:14.200 --> 48:15.992
Should we marry,
me and your mum?

48:16.117 --> 48:18.117
She's sad. Too sad for a man.

48:18.200 --> 48:20.158
- Do you like me, Larch?
- Yeah.

48:20.242 --> 48:21.367
Yeah, I like you.

48:21.533 --> 48:23.492
You're certainly strange,
but it's a strength

48:23.533 --> 48:26.367
- that will set you aside.
- Well, you have many strengths.

48:26.450 --> 48:28.158
Mandy, you're sending this boy
out into the world.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.992
It's more important now
than it's ever been

48:30.033 --> 48:32.283
- for him to be a hero.
- Or just a nice guy.

48:32.367 --> 48:34.367
Just what this world needs,
another nice guy.

48:34.450 --> 48:36.908
- I really like you.
- They fare so well, nice guys.

48:36.950 --> 48:39.075
You should know,
I don't wanna spend my life

48:39.158 --> 48:41.783
convincing you that
what's going on here is gold.

48:43.325 --> 48:46.658
Especially when you're wandering
around, brimming with secrets

48:47.033 --> 48:48.783
then burning up like stars.

48:48.867 --> 48:51.408
- Fucking women.
- It's my right to...

48:51.492 --> 48:55.367
You would rather have your son
wandering around

48:55.450 --> 48:57.992
believing that all his tics
and anxieties

48:58.075 --> 48:59.825
are just his bad luck.

48:59.908 --> 49:02.325
And not because of his cunt dad!

49:02.408 --> 49:03.742
I was protecting him.

49:03.825 --> 49:07.408
From what? From... from what?

49:08.117 --> 49:10.492
A-a man who makes mistakes?

49:11.117 --> 49:13.283
You were protecting yourself.

49:13.950 --> 49:14.950
Fuck!

49:15.908 --> 49:17.950
You know, it's like, it's like

49:18.033 --> 49:21.492
women live in this world
that's seen nuclear warfare.

49:21.575 --> 49:23.575
- Yeah. It's been tough.
- And nobody lives there

49:23.658 --> 49:24.700
but you guys.

49:24.783 --> 49:27.408
Scratching around
for crumbs and daylight

49:27.533 --> 49:30.325
your only comfort being
that you saw it all coming...

49:30.408 --> 49:31.700
He would've made me mad.

49:31.783 --> 49:33.908
Oh, you're already mad.
You're all mad.

49:33.992 --> 49:36.908
- And getting madder.
- Or just better and better.

49:36.992 --> 49:38.992
- No, you're spineless.
- Fucking hell. My God.

49:39.075 --> 49:41.242
- Well, go on, say it.
- What is going on here?

49:41.325 --> 49:43.200
Like, what is going...
It's like, it's like

49:43.283 --> 49:45.283
you've all been living
under some fucking rock.

49:45.367 --> 49:47.533
Louder, Mandy,
like you fucking mean it.

49:47.617 --> 49:50.492
I said, what is going on here?

49:50.617 --> 49:51.825
I said...

49:52.158 --> 49:56.533
Hey! Oi!
Hey, fucking religious people.

49:56.658 --> 49:58.825
Guess what?
People love cautiously now

49:58.908 --> 50:00.367
or not at all

50:00.450 --> 50:02.783
and sometimes, Pete,
sometimes people live alone.

50:02.867 --> 50:04.867
Twice divorced,
and gay as fuck

50:04.950 --> 50:08.242
and fucking richer for it.
It's so fucking cultish here.

50:08.408 --> 50:10.908
It's like a fucking intervention
every time you open your mouth.

50:10.992 --> 50:12.700
Stop being so impressed by it!

50:17.950 --> 50:19.658
You're a sad and hopeless woman.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.408
Your dad fucks arses.

50:37.158 --> 50:38.242
Sorry.

51:11.450 --> 51:12.450
Oi!

51:26.367 --> 51:27.908
Is that your real face?

51:29.117 --> 51:32.825
Those freckles...
they're a gift from God.

52:24.242 --> 52:25.325
Dad.

52:26.992 --> 52:28.117
Oh, God.

52:32.283 --> 52:33.658
I want you to know

52:34.783 --> 52:35.992
I hate you, Dad.

52:37.117 --> 52:39.450
You've made me unusable,
I'm a scrap heap.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.867
- You're a gift.
- For who?

52:44.408 --> 52:46.700
- Whose gift am I?
- You're my gift.

52:50.908 --> 52:52.533
A man wants to marry me, Dad.

52:54.367 --> 52:56.700
- Why wouldn't he? Like I say...
- Look at me, Dad.

52:58.533 --> 52:59.658
Stop that.

53:00.117 --> 53:01.325
Stop that.

53:01.367 --> 53:02.867
You know it's calculating

53:02.950 --> 53:04.700
to watch the way
somebody moves their mouth.

53:04.783 --> 53:06.617
- It's untrusting.
- Well, I am untrusting.

53:06.700 --> 53:09.367
That my fault?
Are you gonna help me grow?

53:09.450 --> 53:10.783
Fuck no.
I don't want you to grow.

53:10.867 --> 53:12.408
We're all the same, Mandy,
all the same

53:12.492 --> 53:14.033
because I'm... I'm missing a bit.

53:14.117 --> 53:16.283
No, you're missing
a fucking chunk, Dad.

53:16.825 --> 53:19.742
Mandy. People want
to move through life

53:19.825 --> 53:22.242
with their finger on someone.
It's comforting.

53:22.325 --> 53:25.492
I don't wanna feel comfortable,
I wanna shed skin.

53:25.575 --> 53:26.617
Like a snake.

53:26.700 --> 53:27.992
I wanna feel the effect
of every minute

53:28.075 --> 53:29.450
and I wanna feel grateful for it

53:29.492 --> 53:32.408
and I wanna fuckin'...
I wanna fuckin' wake up!

53:33.867 --> 53:35.325
I wanna wake up and live!

53:37.867 --> 53:39.450
Understand what I'm getting at?

53:40.533 --> 53:42.367
I want an elaborate family tree

53:42.450 --> 53:45.867
and for our family of followers
to look over it and say, "Wow!

53:46.158 --> 53:48.283
That Vic was a cad!"

53:48.367 --> 53:49.408
Or just a cunt.

53:49.450 --> 53:51.575
- "He lived, didn't he?"
- Before he died of AIDS.

54:10.325 --> 54:12.200
Do you remember
when you were little

54:12.950 --> 54:15.117
and I poured that yoghurt
over your head?

54:19.492 --> 54:20.533
Yeah.

54:20.867 --> 54:21.908
Yeah.

54:22.492 --> 54:25.450
Or when you refused
to wear your lovely new clothes

54:25.533 --> 54:27.408
and I made you wear a bin liner?

54:29.075 --> 54:30.075
Mm-hmm.

54:31.533 --> 54:32.908
And if I died

54:34.242 --> 54:36.575
you'd think about those things
all the time.

54:42.033 --> 54:43.325
If you died, Dad

54:45.700 --> 54:49.075
I'd feel sad that you lived
such a full and colourful life

54:49.158 --> 54:51.450
but were unable
to appreciate any of it.

55:10.658 --> 55:12.117
I'm sorry about your mum.

55:12.950 --> 55:14.117
Yeah. Me too.

55:14.867 --> 55:15.908
It's awful.

55:19.742 --> 55:20.742
I can't believe it.

55:20.825 --> 55:23.325
Really?
We've joked about it for years.

55:23.450 --> 55:24.533
Yeah.

55:25.242 --> 55:26.533
Maybe we shouldn't have.

55:26.700 --> 55:27.783
No.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.325
Can't believe
you told him first.

55:30.492 --> 55:32.200
I tell him everything first.

55:32.742 --> 55:34.158
Why couldn't it be him?

55:35.242 --> 55:36.325
Why is he even here?

55:37.075 --> 55:38.242
He wants to help.

55:47.075 --> 55:48.617
How can you smoke?

55:48.700 --> 55:49.783
Because I love it.

55:50.450 --> 55:51.700
I'm not scared, Mandy.

55:52.742 --> 55:54.533
There's no point
screaming into the wind

55:54.617 --> 55:56.742
asking God for an explanation.

55:56.825 --> 55:59.450
I've never asked him before.
It seems silly.

55:59.825 --> 56:00.867
How's Pete?

56:02.492 --> 56:03.783
- Fuck Pete.
- Oi.

56:09.325 --> 56:10.658
He's sunshine...

56:11.575 --> 56:12.825
and showers, I don't know

56:12.908 --> 56:15.783
I can't really speak cleverly
about him.

56:16.658 --> 56:18.783
Start with his eyes.

56:19.992 --> 56:20.992
Er...

56:22.658 --> 56:24.117
He... Um, they're...

56:26.492 --> 56:29.367
Blue-grey with...

56:30.908 --> 56:32.492
pinprick pupils.

56:33.783 --> 56:35.158
That's a sign of autism.

56:35.783 --> 56:36.783
Is it?

56:37.033 --> 56:39.283
That and walking on your toes,
does he do that?

56:39.408 --> 56:40.408
No.

56:40.742 --> 56:42.617
Sure I would've noticed that one.

56:42.742 --> 56:45.075
Well, you'd love him anyway.

56:46.492 --> 56:48.908
Yeah, but with a heavy heart.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.158
Fuck.

56:59.700 --> 57:01.450
I don't know
what sun was rising

57:01.492 --> 57:03.200
the day that child was conceived

57:03.283 --> 57:07.158
but it was obviously very bad
and very hot.

57:09.825 --> 57:12.533
You know she came out
back first, like a shrimp?

57:13.242 --> 57:15.075
Nearly killed her mother.
She tell you that?

57:15.158 --> 57:16.158
No.

57:16.408 --> 57:17.450
Yeah.

57:19.950 --> 57:21.158
Is it symbolic?

57:21.367 --> 57:22.575
Nah, she isn't interested...

57:23.492 --> 57:24.492
Fuck!

57:37.825 --> 57:39.908
She used to be
such a funny child.

57:40.075 --> 57:41.617
She used to write
these little letters

57:41.700 --> 57:43.242
and slip 'em into our pockets.

57:43.825 --> 57:45.950
Little love letters,
little requests for money

57:46.033 --> 57:48.117
and then, often,
little death threats.

57:49.242 --> 57:50.575
Really? That's amazing.

57:51.200 --> 57:53.033
What, uh...
What kind of threats?

57:53.200 --> 57:54.783
Horrible ones, you know.

57:54.992 --> 57:56.367
Ones that'd have you thinking.

57:56.658 --> 57:57.742
Ha.

57:57.867 --> 58:00.200
You seen the way she sleeps,
with that smile?

58:00.283 --> 58:02.825
Yup. I love that about her.

58:03.700 --> 58:05.283
What, that manic little smile?

58:08.033 --> 58:08.992
Yes.

58:10.617 --> 58:12.325
Suppose she's gotta smile
at something.

58:15.492 --> 58:16.867
God, it's bloody sad.

58:19.450 --> 58:20.450
Mind...

58:21.908 --> 58:23.367
I know what I need to do now.

58:25.242 --> 58:26.242
Pray.

58:41.242 --> 58:42.325
Dear Lord.

58:43.283 --> 58:44.450
When I am afraid

58:45.158 --> 58:46.533
I put my trust in you.

58:48.242 --> 58:51.033
May Marion be wrapped up
in your love.

58:52.408 --> 58:54.742
Found deep
within your everlasting wings.

58:55.533 --> 58:57.617
Do not let her sins dissua...
Um...

58:58.075 --> 58:59.158
no, uh...

59:00.783 --> 59:02.075
D-Deprive. Deprive.

59:02.367 --> 59:05.950
Do... do not let her sins
deprive her of your mercy.

59:06.492 --> 59:08.700
Let the healing power
of Christ...

59:10.742 --> 59:12.325
help her. Amen.

59:37.492 --> 59:38.533
What?

59:39.617 --> 59:41.325
Will you marry me?

59:43.658 --> 59:45.242
Yes. I'll marry you.

1:00:15.283 --> 1:00:16.658
It's mental up here.

1:00:17.700 --> 1:00:19.117
You know I've got vertigo?

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:21.533
- Yeah.
- So this is quite full-on.

1:00:22.283 --> 1:00:24.658
- Sorry about that.
- No, it's fine.

1:00:26.242 --> 1:00:27.700
I've got cancer.

1:00:29.950 --> 1:00:31.033
Yeah.

1:00:31.117 --> 1:00:32.742
Mandy asked me the other day

1:00:32.825 --> 1:00:35.450
what colour your eyes were
and I said I couldn't remember.

1:00:35.533 --> 1:00:36.575
Bit sad.

1:00:36.658 --> 1:00:40.450
I realised I hadn't looked right
at you for almost 17 years.

1:00:41.408 --> 1:00:42.700
Yours are hazel.

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:46.283
Well done.

1:00:46.575 --> 1:00:49.950
Yours are milky. Misty.
Like you've got glaucoma.

1:00:54.117 --> 1:00:56.992
Larch says he wants to keep
everything I've ever worn.

1:00:57.075 --> 1:00:58.533
Bit creepy.

1:00:58.617 --> 1:00:59.742
I think it's sweet.

1:01:06.867 --> 1:01:08.617
I punished you, Marion, I...

1:01:10.408 --> 1:01:12.617
I couldn't believe you did it,
you little bitch.

1:01:13.033 --> 1:01:14.450
You showed me right up.

1:01:16.242 --> 1:01:18.200
You were such a ray of light
when I met you

1:01:18.283 --> 1:01:20.450
and I just stole from you
every day.

1:01:20.533 --> 1:01:21.575
Well, that's marriage.

1:01:21.658 --> 1:01:22.867
Well, I never said thanks

1:01:22.950 --> 1:01:25.533
I just ran away
and gave it to other people.

1:01:50.367 --> 1:01:52.658
I want yours
to be the last face I see

1:01:52.742 --> 1:01:54.033
before I die.

1:02:09.783 --> 1:02:10.783
Meet Alice.

1:02:10.867 --> 1:02:13.242
- She's 22, with a crooked smile.
- No.

1:02:13.325 --> 1:02:15.617
She gets a fucking
whole new mouth

1:02:15.700 --> 1:02:16.950
by the end of the episode.

1:02:17.033 --> 1:02:19.658
Her mouth wins wars
in the company of men.

1:02:19.742 --> 1:02:21.492
- Intimacy?
- God, no. No.

1:02:21.575 --> 1:02:22.783
Alice doesn't need a man.

1:02:22.867 --> 1:02:23.867
Better.

1:02:23.950 --> 1:02:25.783
- Would it be animation?
- Puppets.

1:02:25.867 --> 1:02:27.617
Puppetry. Puppeteering.

1:02:27.700 --> 1:02:29.992
- Christ.
- My heart. I'm excited.

1:02:30.617 --> 1:02:32.783
Mandy?
What have you got for me, Mandy?

1:02:34.242 --> 1:02:35.242
Mandy.

1:02:35.325 --> 1:02:37.075
Mandy!

1:02:38.117 --> 1:02:40.158
The room is bathed
in southern light.

1:02:41.325 --> 1:02:43.700
We hear the scratching sound
of pen on paper.

1:02:44.950 --> 1:02:48.408
We follow a trail of sequins
and broken afro.

1:02:49.283 --> 1:02:50.992
And we find a woman
on her knees.

1:02:51.075 --> 1:02:52.242
Back to the camera.

1:02:53.117 --> 1:02:54.200
She's black.

1:02:55.408 --> 1:02:58.742
Her arse, once a peach,
now sits sadly.

1:03:00.158 --> 1:03:02.408
We track up her spine
to her neck.

1:03:03.075 --> 1:03:06.450
And we recognise
the most remarkable vocal hum.

1:03:07.700 --> 1:03:09.950
With her afro in disarray
and madness in her eyes

1:03:10.033 --> 1:03:11.367
she turns to the camera.

1:03:14.242 --> 1:03:15.575
This is Beyoncé.

1:03:16.408 --> 1:03:18.033
And this is her suicide note.

1:03:22.117 --> 1:03:23.117
Out.

1:03:24.658 --> 1:03:26.075
Everyone out.

1:03:28.783 --> 1:03:29.950
But not you.

1:03:32.783 --> 1:03:33.992
What, I mean...

1:03:36.158 --> 1:03:37.700
what a horrible suggestion.

1:03:38.242 --> 1:03:39.242
What...

1:03:40.575 --> 1:03:42.492
What do you want me
to do, uh, Mandy?

1:03:42.617 --> 1:03:46.242
You want me to submit
some fucking suicide note

1:03:46.325 --> 1:03:48.117
to the BBC
and call it "dramedy?"

1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:50.575
I mean, it's absurd.
It's absurd!

1:03:51.783 --> 1:03:53.325
And it's the most
unlikely outcome.

1:03:53.408 --> 1:03:55.533
I mean,
it doesn't even ring true.

1:03:55.617 --> 1:03:56.575
Just...

1:03:58.033 --> 1:03:59.158
Beyoncé...

1:03:59.825 --> 1:04:01.492
has her fucking head
in the game.

1:04:01.867 --> 1:04:03.158
It will end badly.

1:04:03.408 --> 1:04:04.950
You have terrible energy.

1:04:06.325 --> 1:04:08.200
I'll overlook that
cos your mother's dying

1:04:08.283 --> 1:04:10.117
but fuck, I warned you.

1:04:13.783 --> 1:04:15.200
And you're so pretty.

1:04:16.742 --> 1:04:18.742
Why do you do this to me?
To yourself?

1:04:20.033 --> 1:04:22.075
OK, what... What're you doing?

1:04:22.908 --> 1:04:24.325
Where... Where are you going?

1:04:24.908 --> 1:04:27.783
Oh. Oh! Oh, I see.
You're fired.

1:04:28.075 --> 1:04:29.200
You're fired.

1:04:29.283 --> 1:04:31.075
You're fucking fired!

1:04:32.950 --> 1:04:33.992
OK, can...

1:04:34.367 --> 1:04:36.700
Can we get you all...
Can we get you back in here?

1:04:36.783 --> 1:04:37.742
Please?

1:05:22.992 --> 1:05:25.367
It wouldn't help.
It wasn't for you.

1:05:25.867 --> 1:05:26.908
Don't.

1:05:27.617 --> 1:05:29.450
I'm gonna ask you some questions

1:05:29.617 --> 1:05:31.367
- and I want some...
- Jesus.

1:05:33.992 --> 1:05:35.492
That's your gift to me.

1:05:36.408 --> 1:05:37.575
Alright, go on then.

1:05:38.742 --> 1:05:41.242
Did you spend
that money, from my mum

1:05:41.908 --> 1:05:43.825
on that dirty brown Merc?

1:05:44.825 --> 1:05:45.825
Yeah.

1:05:47.325 --> 1:05:49.700
Did you sleep
with Carla behind my back?

1:05:49.825 --> 1:05:51.825
That's one of
Mandy's little fantasies.

1:05:51.950 --> 1:05:55.283
Did you have an affair
with Rebecca Staines?

1:05:55.783 --> 1:05:57.867
You and me hadn't had sex
for months.

1:05:57.950 --> 1:06:03.075
Did you have an affair
with Rebecca Staines?

1:06:04.033 --> 1:06:06.742
- I'm confused.
- I'm dying, Vic.

1:06:16.492 --> 1:06:17.658
No, Marion.

1:06:18.742 --> 1:06:21.408
I did not have an affair
with Rebecca Staines.

1:06:26.158 --> 1:06:27.200
Thank you.

1:06:41.325 --> 1:06:42.408
Fuckin' hell.

1:06:51.158 --> 1:06:52.492
Fuck.

1:06:52.617 --> 1:06:53.742
You're not hard.

1:06:53.825 --> 1:06:54.992
I'm not into it.

1:06:55.283 --> 1:06:57.242
My mum's dying
in the room next door

1:06:57.325 --> 1:06:58.742
I'm on the bed
about to suck your cock

1:06:58.825 --> 1:07:00.408
can you just get into it,
please?

1:07:00.992 --> 1:07:02.575
Shall I talk some filth
in your ear?

1:07:02.658 --> 1:07:03.700
Alright.

1:07:03.867 --> 1:07:05.742
I fucked
someone else last night.

1:07:05.825 --> 1:07:06.908
Yeah?

1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:09.783
I didn't want to,
but you'd made me sad.

1:07:10.408 --> 1:07:11.575
Then he touched my leg

1:07:11.658 --> 1:07:13.825
and didn't ask me for anything
and that was a relief.

1:07:13.908 --> 1:07:15.450
Where did you meet
this stranger?

1:07:15.533 --> 1:07:16.658
In a coffee shop.

1:07:16.742 --> 1:07:18.450
What man drinks coffee
late at night?

1:07:18.533 --> 1:07:20.992
A sober man. A kind man.

1:07:21.825 --> 1:07:23.825
He told me I was
the prettiest girl in London.

1:07:23.908 --> 1:07:24.992
Oh, Christ!

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:27.033
And I loved that.

1:07:27.117 --> 1:07:29.700
And I thought, "I want this kind
of encounter for life."

1:07:31.033 --> 1:07:32.700
Are you... Are you crying?

1:07:32.783 --> 1:07:34.450
No, just...

1:07:35.658 --> 1:07:37.450
He promised to never love me

1:07:37.533 --> 1:07:39.783
- but to always fuck me.
- Oh, I'm cumming!

1:07:40.492 --> 1:07:41.992
I told him
to cum inside of me.

1:07:42.075 --> 1:07:43.325
Oh, yes. I'm cumming!

1:07:43.408 --> 1:07:44.700
- And he did.
- Oh, fuck.

1:07:44.783 --> 1:07:46.575
- He came inside my pussy.
- Oh, God! Fuck!

1:07:46.658 --> 1:07:47.783
Fuck...

1:07:50.325 --> 1:07:51.408
Fuckin' hell.

1:07:51.492 --> 1:07:52.658
Fuck sake.

1:08:09.533 --> 1:08:11.950
When Nan dies, will she...

1:08:12.575 --> 1:08:14.450
Nan says when she dies

1:08:14.533 --> 1:08:16.075
she'll just be bones
in the ground

1:08:16.157 --> 1:08:17.950
and that she'll be eaten
by insects.

1:08:18.992 --> 1:08:20.117
Nan said that?

1:08:20.407 --> 1:08:22.075
Why won't she go to heaven?

1:08:22.742 --> 1:08:24.282
She doesn't believe in heaven.

1:08:24.367 --> 1:08:25.450
Why not?

1:08:25.532 --> 1:08:27.075
People believe
in different things.

1:08:27.157 --> 1:08:28.492
I wanna go to heaven.

1:08:28.617 --> 1:08:29.617
Why?

1:08:29.700 --> 1:08:32.117
Because it's warm and
better than Earth, of course.

1:08:33.075 --> 1:08:35.450
Mum! You'll be there, won't you?

1:08:35.575 --> 1:08:37.200
- You'll be there, won't you?
- Larch.

1:08:37.282 --> 1:08:38.950
- You'll be there in Heaven!
- Stop it.

1:08:39.032 --> 1:08:41.075
- Stop it. Larch.
- You're scaring me, Mum.

1:08:41.242 --> 1:08:43.742
Do you not wanna be
in Heaven with me?

1:08:44.282 --> 1:08:46.992
Course you do!
Of course you believe in Heaven.

1:08:47.117 --> 1:08:48.532
That's idiotic if you don't.

1:08:48.700 --> 1:08:49.825
Don't you? Don't you?

1:08:50.325 --> 1:08:52.450
Don't you?
You believe in Heaven!

1:08:52.867 --> 1:08:54.867
You do. You believe in Heaven!

1:08:56.367 --> 1:08:59.282
Don't you? Don't you? Don't you?

1:09:02.450 --> 1:09:04.867
Course you do.
Don't you? Don't you?

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:06.950
Of course you believe in Heaven.

1:09:07.825 --> 1:09:09.242
Don't you? Don't you?

1:09:31.825 --> 1:09:32.825
Hey.

1:09:40.992 --> 1:09:41.950
Oh!

1:10:42.325 --> 1:10:43.742
<i>Oh, Lord, help me.</i>

1:10:44.033 --> 1:10:45.283
<i>Help me, Lord.</i>

1:10:45.992 --> 1:10:47.450
<i>She's a woman in a crisis.</i>

1:10:48.033 --> 1:10:49.492
<i>She's a woman
without boundaries.</i>

1:10:49.575 --> 1:10:51.992
<i>Something we share, perhaps.
Should be fun, shouldn't it?</i>

1:10:52.075 --> 1:10:53.492
<i>Should be hot, shouldn't it?</i>

1:10:55.158 --> 1:10:56.450
<i>Oh, I'm exhausted.</i>

1:10:57.658 --> 1:10:59.117
<i>You've tried me, Lord.</i>

1:10:59.742 --> 1:11:02.117
<i>You've led me here,
you've delivered this anarchist</i>

1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:04.242
<i>and I know,
"Suffer, suffer. Grow, grow."</i>

1:11:04.325 --> 1:11:06.950
<i>But I just wanna suffer
in a corner</i>

1:11:07.033 --> 1:11:08.367
<i>till she shows me forever.</i>

1:11:08.658 --> 1:11:10.575
<i>And what of this man
she's fucking in grief?</i>

1:11:10.658 --> 1:11:11.950
<i>This coffee shop predator?</i>

1:11:12.033 --> 1:11:13.825
<i>Is this my future,
or is this a test?</i>

1:11:14.575 --> 1:11:15.617
<i>I can't know.</i>

1:11:15.742 --> 1:11:17.492
<i>Maybe she was comforting me
with this filth.</i>

1:11:17.575 --> 1:11:19.742
<i>It worked.
She's fucking perverse.</i>

1:11:20.658 --> 1:11:22.908
<i>I hate how small
my penis looks in her hands.</i>

1:11:23.075 --> 1:11:25.575
<i>What are big hands good for,
anyway? Building walls?</i>

1:11:25.825 --> 1:11:27.658
<i>I just wanna hold a normal hand.</i>

1:11:28.617 --> 1:11:30.492
<i>A slight and manageable palm</i>

1:11:30.575 --> 1:11:32.617
<i>that willingly joins me
on this journey.</i>

1:11:33.533 --> 1:11:34.700
<i>I wanna hold a hand.</i>

1:11:37.158 --> 1:11:38.783
<i>I'm going to hold a hand.</i>

1:12:46.492 --> 1:12:47.908
Are you not in love
with me anymore?

1:12:47.950 --> 1:12:49.117
What?

1:12:49.450 --> 1:12:51.992
Am I not shiny enough?

1:12:53.075 --> 1:12:54.533
Just tell me about your day.

1:12:57.492 --> 1:12:58.658
Well...

1:12:59.825 --> 1:13:02.700
I woke up, I saw you

1:13:02.783 --> 1:13:04.075
I felt guilty

1:13:04.158 --> 1:13:06.325
I thought about having a wank

1:13:06.700 --> 1:13:09.117
but then I decided
to do some work on the wedding

1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.075
and then I'd reward myself
with a wank.

1:13:11.158 --> 1:13:12.575
Well, we could've just had sex.

1:13:12.658 --> 1:13:13.742
Nah.

1:13:14.033 --> 1:13:15.450
Let's go home
and make a baby.

1:13:15.533 --> 1:13:18.158
I only produce strange children.
You said so yourself.

1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:26.617
Why are you being like this?

1:13:27.867 --> 1:13:29.950
Why are you placating me?
I'm fucking giving you nothing.

1:13:30.033 --> 1:13:32.117
- Just be a fucking man.
- Just trying to be respectful.

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:33.533
Why? Just be yourself, Pete.

1:13:33.617 --> 1:13:35.533
Just tell me I'm stupid,
or damaged.

1:13:35.617 --> 1:13:37.450
You... you fucking...
you just smack of guilt.

1:13:37.533 --> 1:13:39.742
You fucking reek of it.
What did you do, Pete?

1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:43.283
- What did you do, Pete?
- Fucked someone else.

1:13:44.950 --> 1:13:45.992
Hm?

1:13:47.242 --> 1:13:51.242
I took myself
and all that rejection

1:13:51.742 --> 1:13:53.117
and headed into town.

1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:55.908
Right, I wasn't looking at you
for longer than five minutes?

1:13:56.617 --> 1:13:58.117
I got fired, is that it?

1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:01.117
No, I was happy
when you were fired.

1:14:01.283 --> 1:14:02.283
You were happy?

1:14:02.367 --> 1:14:04.075
It made you vulnerable
for once.

1:14:04.158 --> 1:14:06.617
And don't talk to me
about my indiscretions, darlin'

1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:09.283
I think we're both enjoying
something progressive here.

1:14:09.867 --> 1:14:11.033
Yeah.

1:14:11.658 --> 1:14:13.242
Yeah, you know
what I'm talking about.

1:14:14.533 --> 1:14:15.825
- Slag.
- What?

1:14:16.950 --> 1:14:18.742
Y'know,
I-I want you to know

1:14:19.950 --> 1:14:21.117
I couldn't get it up.

1:14:22.033 --> 1:14:23.158
Alright? I couldn't.

1:14:32.283 --> 1:14:34.450
Did you fuck
that coffee shop gigolo?

1:14:34.533 --> 1:14:36.575
The man from the other night.

1:14:36.658 --> 1:14:37.950
The night of tall tales.

1:14:40.908 --> 1:14:44.033
What? What?
I'm just being a man.

1:14:45.450 --> 1:14:46.825
Be a fucking hero.

1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:48.492
Rise above it.

1:15:51.033 --> 1:15:52.283
Hi!

1:16:21.658 --> 1:16:23.492
...you are
a fucking fool, Marion.

1:16:23.575 --> 1:16:25.325
Sometimes
you behave like a fool.

1:16:25.742 --> 1:16:28.242
I've had it up to here with you
all this fucking year...

1:16:38.867 --> 1:16:39.992
...I hate that jumper

1:16:40.075 --> 1:16:41.908
I've hated that jumper
for fucking years!

1:17:32.325 --> 1:17:37.825
<i>♪ La, la, la ♪</i>

1:17:38.908 --> 1:17:42.533
<i>♪ La, la, la ♪</i>

1:17:44.242 --> 1:17:47.075
<i>A man will always
send you mad, Mand.</i>

1:17:50.283 --> 1:17:52.908
<i>Always squirrel
a bit of yourself away.</i>

1:17:56.242 --> 1:17:59.450
<i>Never ever fully disclose
yourself to anybody.</i>

1:18:02.033 --> 1:18:04.325
<i>I don't want you
to forgive your father</i>

1:18:04.408 --> 1:18:07.200
<i>but, I dunno, maybe you should.</i>

1:18:10.742 --> 1:18:11.825
<i>Got a light?</i>

1:18:34.867 --> 1:18:36.117
<i>I'm scared.</i>

1:19:40.492 --> 1:19:41.533
Thank you.

1:19:48.617 --> 1:19:49.658
Mandy...

1:19:49.867 --> 1:19:51.242
Knowing Man... Mandy...

1:20:08.908 --> 1:20:11.117
<i>I love and I respect myself...</i>

1:20:13.283 --> 1:20:15.825
...even though I'm a failure,
I love and respect myself.

1:20:15.950 --> 1:20:17.325
Even though I'm a failure...

1:20:17.658 --> 1:20:20.408
<i>Even though I'm a fraud,
even though I'm scared</i>

1:20:20.492 --> 1:20:21.992
<i>I still love
and respect myself...</i>

1:20:44.617 --> 1:20:45.950
Thanks for seeing me.

1:20:47.575 --> 1:20:48.992
Did I break up a party?

1:20:50.825 --> 1:20:51.950
Not this time.

1:20:52.700 --> 1:20:55.367
You look, um...
well, you look lighter.

1:20:55.492 --> 1:20:56.783
Since the funeral, I mean.

1:20:58.158 --> 1:20:59.617
I'm sorry about
the speech that day.

1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:00.742
Oh, it's fine.

1:21:08.200 --> 1:21:09.700
Why are you here, Pete?

1:21:11.533 --> 1:21:13.450
Holding my massive hand?

1:21:20.242 --> 1:21:21.450
I found my girl.

1:21:26.742 --> 1:21:28.033
Yeah, just when, uh

1:21:28.450 --> 1:21:30.575
I was about to turn my back
on God, Meredith arrived.

1:21:30.658 --> 1:21:32.200
- Out of the blue.
- Or the red.

1:21:35.033 --> 1:21:36.617
Like you, she's had a rough time

1:21:36.700 --> 1:21:38.242
but she's young, so...

1:21:41.950 --> 1:21:43.492
You know,
I'd never thought about

1:21:43.575 --> 1:21:45.200
how much I hated God
until I met you.

1:21:46.325 --> 1:21:47.367
Sorry.

1:21:47.908 --> 1:21:50.242
Why?
You don't believe in anything.

1:21:51.492 --> 1:21:52.658
Maybe I do.

1:21:59.283 --> 1:22:00.408
I miss your misery.

1:22:03.325 --> 1:22:04.575
Meredith is beautiful

1:22:04.658 --> 1:22:07.575
but she is impressed
by everything.

1:22:07.658 --> 1:22:09.200
Well, that's youth.

1:22:09.617 --> 1:22:11.742
I suppose it works in my favour,
she thinks I'm great.

1:22:11.992 --> 1:22:13.492
That's what you wanted.

1:22:15.450 --> 1:22:16.492
Yeah.

1:22:17.908 --> 1:22:18.992
I needed that.

1:22:25.408 --> 1:22:27.867
- My ticking's back.
- No, it isn't.

1:22:28.825 --> 1:22:29.867
Yeah, it is.

1:22:31.242 --> 1:22:32.283
Come here.

1:22:42.825 --> 1:22:44.533
Listen, if I marry Meredith

1:22:44.783 --> 1:22:47.700
I'll never divorce her,
so this is...

1:23:07.575 --> 1:23:08.617
Mandy?

1:23:09.658 --> 1:23:10.658
Mandy!

1:23:11.575 --> 1:23:12.617
Mandy!

1:23:14.325 --> 1:23:17.117
Every day I spent with you,
a little piece of me died.

1:23:17.408 --> 1:23:19.283
It's called a relationship,
you fuckin' idiot.

1:23:19.367 --> 1:23:21.200
Classic male bullshit.

1:23:21.783 --> 1:23:23.783
I felt like you sat

1:23:23.950 --> 1:23:26.075
right in the way
of what made me strong.

1:23:26.242 --> 1:23:28.283
And it was a relief.

1:23:28.367 --> 1:23:30.742
What do you want, religious man?

1:23:31.950 --> 1:23:33.283
I-I wanna feel...

1:23:33.367 --> 1:23:34.783
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

1:23:35.492 --> 1:23:38.575
I-I wanna feel...
I wanna feel hopeful.

1:23:39.242 --> 1:23:40.575
I wanna feel hopeful

1:23:40.658 --> 1:23:42.492
that if this woman
walks away from me right now

1:23:42.533 --> 1:23:44.450
she's gonna be alright,
but I don't know if she will.

1:23:44.492 --> 1:23:46.325
Oh, she will!

1:23:46.408 --> 1:23:47.783
You swine!

1:23:48.117 --> 1:23:49.450
- Fuck off!
- Yes, I will!

1:23:53.950 --> 1:23:55.367
W-What do you want?

1:23:55.450 --> 1:23:58.492
What do you want?

1:23:58.700 --> 1:24:00.075
What do you want?

1:24:17.867 --> 1:24:19.450
I want a five-hour day.

1:24:21.408 --> 1:24:23.742
And I want a fuck-off promotion.

1:24:24.450 --> 1:24:27.867
I wanna make... stew that keeps.

1:24:27.950 --> 1:24:29.950
- You don't need to make stew.
- I wanna have time

1:24:30.033 --> 1:24:31.492
to share it with my son.

1:24:31.575 --> 1:24:34.575
I wanna masturbate less.

1:24:34.658 --> 1:24:36.408
What? I love masturbating...

1:24:36.492 --> 1:24:38.492
I wanna like myself more.

1:24:41.908 --> 1:24:42.992
I want a man.

1:24:47.033 --> 1:24:48.075
No!

1:24:49.408 --> 1:24:51.575
I told you this. Come on, Mand.

1:24:53.783 --> 1:24:54.783
Fuck this.

1:24:55.158 --> 1:24:56.325
I'd like a man.

1:24:58.492 --> 1:24:59.658
A kind man.

1:25:01.158 --> 1:25:02.700
But you're not the one, Pete.

1:25:04.242 --> 1:25:05.700
You're your mother's ruin.

1:25:06.492 --> 1:25:08.908
The problem with you, Pete,
is you're mean when you're hurt

1:25:08.992 --> 1:25:10.992
but you're hurt all the time.

1:25:11.742 --> 1:25:13.367
You're broken, Mandy.

1:25:16.367 --> 1:25:17.658
I know.

1:25:17.783 --> 1:25:20.450
Just, just...
just think about your son.

1:25:23.867 --> 1:25:24.908
I am.

1:25:44.408 --> 1:25:45.617
I love you.

1:25:45.908 --> 1:25:47.033
I love you too.
