00:01.083 --> 00:03.083
(Phone ringing, papers rustle)

00:03.083 --> 00:04.916
- Oh great, um, these, the
contracts are in triplicate,

00:04.916 --> 00:07.208
ready for Mr. Galvin to sign.
Thank you.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.958
(Phone rings)
Julianne Giacomelli's office.

00:09.958 --> 00:12.250
Uh-huh.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.958
Spencer. Rush delivery
to New York. Thanks.

00:13.958 --> 00:15.583
We've already canceled.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.125
If Deepak Chopra is
not gonna be there

00:17.125 --> 00:18.583
than she's not gonna be there.
Okay, great.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.291
(Phones ringing)

00:20.291 --> 00:23.166
Oh, more? 'Cause there is
no room on my desk.

00:23.166 --> 00:24.541
Remember that little
fishing boat

00:24.541 --> 00:26.041
from "The Perfect Storm"?

00:26.041 --> 00:27.958
How it climbed up
that endless wave,

00:27.958 --> 00:29.625
hoping to reach the top

00:29.625 --> 00:31.708
and cruise down
the other side to safety?

00:31.708 --> 00:33.250
That's me.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.708
Okay, good. Um, these are good
to go.

00:34.708 --> 00:36.333
I just corrected some typos
in paragraph four.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.791
Okay, thank you.
(Phones ring, overwhelmed moan)

00:38.791 --> 00:40.333
But just like that
fishing boat...

00:40.333 --> 00:42.875
I can't seem to quite
crest the wave.

00:42.875 --> 00:44.875
Julianne Giacomelli's office.
Ryan: Hey, I'm back.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.333
Would you believe me
if I told you

00:46.333 --> 00:48.916
the national dish of Ecuador
is guinea pig?

00:48.916 --> 00:51.458
- Uh, hey Ryan, I'm sorry,
this really isn't a good time.

00:51.458 --> 00:52.416
I'm just-I'm buried in work.

00:52.416 --> 00:54.375
- All right this won't take
long. I just wanted to see

00:54.375 --> 00:56.125
if we can shift our plans
from tonight to tomorrow night.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.250
- Uh, why, did something
come up?

00:57.250 --> 00:58.916
- Josh called, and he can only
get together tonight.

00:58.916 --> 01:00.791
Erica: Oh.

01:00.791 --> 01:02.250
- But tomorrow night,
I promise, I'm all yours.

01:02.250 --> 01:05.250
Dinner, movie, roast guinea
pig, you name it.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.125
Okay, sure. I guess. Um...

01:08.750 --> 01:10.125
Look, is this gonna be
a problem?

01:10.125 --> 01:12.666
- No.
- Ryan, my sister hates me.

01:12.666 --> 01:14.083
It's not a stretch to imagine
that her husband

01:14.083 --> 01:16.666
isn't exactly thrilled that
we're together.

01:16.666 --> 01:18.625
- That's his deal.
And, for what it's worth,

01:18.625 --> 01:20.625
this whole thing between you
and your sister?

01:20.625 --> 01:23.125
I'm sure it'll blow over.
- I hope so. Bye.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.875
- I'd hate to keep you from
planning your social life,

01:24.875 --> 01:26.833
I just thought maybe you could,
you know, do your job.

01:26.833 --> 01:29.083
- I am. Uh, what do you need?

01:29.083 --> 01:31.625
- Uh, the launch strategy file
for Mark Stahl's book,
five minutes ago.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.208
- Okay, well, when does he
want to hear it?

01:33.208 --> 01:34.500
- Now. And you're helping
with the pitch,

01:34.500 --> 01:36.083
So, come on, it's game time.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.041
- Whoa, we're launching
a book that Stahl hasn't
even written yet?

01:38.041 --> 01:39.750
I mean, we don't even
have the chapters?

01:39.750 --> 01:40.833
- Yes, Erica, we do have them.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.750
They're in editing.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.875
Show me your poker face.

01:44.875 --> 01:48.291
(Phones ringing)

01:48.291 --> 01:50.958
Oh, God, help us.

01:50.958 --> 01:52.375
We think that this book
is perfect

01:52.375 --> 01:54.125
for the business
traveler market.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.791
- We think?
Erica: We know.

01:56.791 --> 01:58.291
Uh, the research backs it up.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.291
Young professionals,
they love self-help books

02:00.291 --> 02:03.083
with a dash of schadenfreude
thrown in.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.958
- (Clears throat) We'll focus
on the tell-all angle.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.791
- Which we leverage
for the talk shows.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.750
- All for a major
pre-Christmas launch.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.791
- And with a cover this good?

02:10.791 --> 02:13.875
We think it'll grab
everyone's eye.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.750
- Hmm. Bring it here.

02:18.875 --> 02:21.000
Oh.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.166
I'm liking this. It's grabby.

02:24.166 --> 02:25.583
I'll take the chapters home
tonight,

02:25.583 --> 02:27.125
and send you my notes
in the morning.

02:27.125 --> 02:29.166
- Oh, actually, Frank, um...
we do have three chapters,

02:29.166 --> 02:31.166
but they're still very...

02:31.166 --> 02:33.000
- Raw.
- Raw.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.208
- I don't need 'em prettied up.
I wanna see what I'm paying for.

02:35.208 --> 02:36.541
Who's got them right now?

02:36.541 --> 02:38.000
- Oh, um...

02:38.000 --> 02:40.333
- Who? Um... Dory.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.916
- Dory is editing "The history
of coffee".

02:41.916 --> 02:44.250
I just spoke to her.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.916
Stop bullshitting me,
and get me something to read!

02:46.916 --> 02:48.250
Today!

02:53.083 --> 02:54.500
Erica: So, if you're
in the water

02:54.500 --> 02:55.875
and the waves keep
smacking you down,

02:55.875 --> 02:57.208
what do you do?

02:58.833 --> 03:01.000
Sometimes you manage
to soldier on,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.708
Clutch the steering wheel
and face the storm.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.916
- Dory?

03:05.916 --> 03:08.416
Everyone knows she's editing
the freaking coffee book.

03:08.416 --> 03:10.416
- Julianne, I'm sorry.
I just I-I thought that--

03:10.416 --> 03:12.875
- Oh, well you won't be doing
that again, will you?

03:12.875 --> 03:14.958
If we don't have pages
by end of day,

03:14.958 --> 03:17.041
Galvin will have me
thrown out that window

03:17.041 --> 03:19.291
and I'll throw you first
to break my fall.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.083
Believe me.
- I do.

03:21.083 --> 03:23.666
- Then get me pages.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.625
Okay.

03:25.625 --> 03:27.916
(Phones ringing)

03:32.208 --> 03:33.666
Erica: While other times,

03:33.666 --> 03:35.958
you look around and see
the situation clearly.

03:35.958 --> 03:38.833
That ultimately you're going
to drown.

Gary: When I said let's have
lunch,

04:25.208 --> 04:26.958
I meant let's have lunch
in a restaurant.

04:26.958 --> 04:28.375
Erica: No time. Besides,
standing up eating,

04:28.375 --> 04:30.458
I think it's better
for digestion, anyway.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.875
- You know what I want
to talk to you about.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.708
- Dad, please, I can't today.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.250
- You know how hard it is,

04:36.250 --> 04:38.125
to have my two daughters
not speaking to each other?

04:38.125 --> 04:39.500
- Okay, well, try being
one of the daughters.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.083
I mean, she won't return
my calls.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.833
I've tried leaving messages,
I've tried email, I mean...

04:43.833 --> 04:45.375
I've tried, but at a certain
point, dad,

04:45.375 --> 04:47.250
you just, you gotta say
enough is enough.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.708
- So, you're giving up
on your sister.

04:48.708 --> 04:50.166
Is that it?

04:50.166 --> 04:53.041
- I really miss her.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.708
- I know. What can I do?

04:55.708 --> 04:57.375
- Nothing.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.833
That's why I didn't
wanna talk about this.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.375
This is what I'm afraid of.
- What?

05:00.375 --> 05:01.958
Come on, dad, it's always
the same.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.291
It's always you and me
over here

05:03.291 --> 05:05.000
and Sam and mom over there.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.541
And, Sam, she'll just get mad

05:06.541 --> 05:08.375
if she thinks that
you're on my side.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.208
- I'm not taking sides.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.416
I want my girls to make up.
That's all.

05:13.416 --> 05:15.041
Let me speak to her.

05:15.041 --> 05:17.208
Sometimes a fight gets to a
point where you need a mediator.

05:17.208 --> 05:19.500
Someone with perspective.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.458
- I gotta get back to work.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.333
I love you, dad.
- I love you.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.333
- Thanks for the sandwich.

05:27.333 --> 05:30.500
(Elevator dings,
phones ringing)

05:30.500 --> 05:32.166
- You must have a horseshoe
tucked somewhere

05:32.166 --> 05:34.125
I don't wanna know about.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.750
But then again, maybe I do.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.250
- Brent, what is it?

05:38.250 --> 05:40.250
- Marcus Stahl is in
the hizouse.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.083
Not a moment too soon.

05:42.083 --> 05:44.541
- Oh, thank God.
Does Julianne know?

05:44.541 --> 05:47.291
- Mm-hmm.
- Good, thank you.

05:47.291 --> 05:49.291
- Ah, Mr. Stahl.

05:49.291 --> 05:51.125
- Mm, oh. Got your messages.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.666
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
get back to you sooner,

05:52.666 --> 05:54.125
but things have been
just, kind of crazy,

05:54.125 --> 05:55.958
with me working and thinking
and really

05:55.958 --> 05:57.375
trying to construct something.

05:57.375 --> 05:58.750
You know, I mean,
something good.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.208
- Of course, Of course.

06:00.208 --> 06:01.625
It's good to see you, you know?

06:01.625 --> 06:03.000
We really need those pages.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.541
- Mm-hmm. Yup.

06:04.541 --> 06:07.291
Oh, yes, the, um... the pages.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.166
- Yeah. I mean, to be honest,

06:09.166 --> 06:10.583
we were a getting little bit
worried,

06:10.583 --> 06:13.375
but now that you're here
it's, it's all good.

06:13.375 --> 06:16.166
You did, you did bring them
with you?

06:16.166 --> 06:19.041
- Nothing?! Nothing at all?
Not even one page?

06:19.041 --> 06:21.625
- I've been trying.

06:21.625 --> 06:24.000
Okay, I've been sitting
at my desk, but... I'm sorry.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.375
- Oh, oh, you're sorry.

06:26.375 --> 06:27.958
Well, that definitely takes
the sting out of the slap

06:27.958 --> 06:29.833
you just laid across my face.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.541
- Julianne, listen to me,

06:31.541 --> 06:36.791
it's not gonna happen,
you just... have to accept it.

06:36.791 --> 06:38.833
I'm walking away.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.500
- You promised us a book
we could have on the shelves
for Christmas.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.416
And we've put a lot of time,
resources,

06:43.416 --> 06:45.125
and a lot of money into this.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.708
So, no, I do not accept it.
And you just can't walk away.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.166
- Yes, I can.
- You cashed the advance.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.875
- I'll pay it back.
- And you'll be talking to our
lawyers, all ten of them.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.583
- Fine. Fine. You go ahead and
do whatever you want,

06:54.583 --> 06:56.541
But it's not gonna get
a goddamn book out of me!

06:56.541 --> 06:58.166
Because... I give up.

07:01.541 --> 07:04.458
(Teary breaths, welling up)
I can't...

07:06.375 --> 07:10.166
I can't go back there.
And I won't.

07:17.541 --> 07:20.375
- Well, you can't really type
in a straight jacket.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.416
Can't do coke in a straight
jacket, either.

07:24.416 --> 07:26.166
Mister Stahl.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.041
Please, I know that we just
freaked you out back there.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.125
- What is this?
Good cop, bad cop?

07:30.125 --> 07:31.000
- No, not at all.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.250
I just, I just came to tell you
that I think that I understand-

07:33.250 --> 07:34.541
- Oh, you understand?
- Yes.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.500
When you said that you can't
go back there,

07:36.500 --> 07:39.583
I mean, you meant to that
time in your life, right?

07:39.583 --> 07:42.625
- What are you, a shrink
slumming as someone's assistant?

07:42.625 --> 07:44.375
- You're absolutely right,

07:44.375 --> 07:46.083
I don't know what it's like
to struggle with an addiction,

07:46.083 --> 07:48.500
but I do know how painful
it can be to face the past.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.375
And sometimes the best way to
deal with something horrible

07:53.375 --> 07:57.125
that's happened to us, is...
is to revisit it.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.416
to take a really good,
long, hard look at it.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.708
I mean, that's just my opinion.

08:05.708 --> 08:08.333
And it's not just for
the good of the book,

08:08.333 --> 08:10.458
it's good for you.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.291
- When does Galvin need
the pages?

08:18.291 --> 08:22.000
- Um... Tonight.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.125
- I can't promise you anything.
- Of course.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.875
(Button clicks)

08:31.541 --> 08:34.125
- Dad, I'm sorry, but you can't
just come to my work

08:34.125 --> 08:36.416
and upset me like this.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.791
What happened between Erica and
I has nothing to do with you.

08:38.791 --> 08:41.750
- You're both my daughters, it
has everything to do with me.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.500
Your sister loves you,
I know you know that.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.041
And I know you also know,

08:45.041 --> 08:47.291
she'd never do purposely
anything hurt you.

08:47.291 --> 08:50.000
- Big surprise. You're siding
with her even now.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.750
- I am not siding with her.

08:51.750 --> 08:55.166
- Dad, she told me
not to marry my husband,

08:55.166 --> 08:57.166
she told me that
he doesn't love me,

08:57.166 --> 08:59.666
five minutes before I was about
to walk down the aisle.

08:59.666 --> 09:01.625
- I know.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.583
But your refusing to speak
to her is not the answer.

09:06.291 --> 09:09.000
What you're doing is hurting
you, I can see it in your face.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.291
You can't just give up
on your relationship.

09:12.291 --> 09:13.750
You have to, at the very least,

09:13.750 --> 09:15.208
try to understand
why she said it.

09:15.208 --> 09:18.208
- Okay, you did not
just suggest that?

09:18.208 --> 09:19.666
- Sam.
- No!

09:19.666 --> 09:22.208
I don't need to understand why.

09:22.208 --> 09:24.041
I don't need to talk about it.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.458
And if you keep bringing it up,

09:26.458 --> 09:28.541
we won't have anything left
to talk about, at all.

09:36.666 --> 09:38.083
- For the first time
in my professional career

09:38.083 --> 09:39.541
I have no idea what to do.

09:39.541 --> 09:41.458
- I do. We rain hellfire on him.

09:41.458 --> 09:43.083
We set Galvin's team of
soulless,

09:43.083 --> 09:44.666
baby-eating lawyers
on his neurotic ass.

09:44.666 --> 09:47.666
No. No lawyer, not even ours,

09:47.666 --> 09:49.291
can legally compel someone
to write a book

09:49.291 --> 09:51.541
that they don't wanna write.
We're cooked.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.458
- Stahl said he'd get me pages.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.541
- Oh my God, you are so naive.

09:55.541 --> 09:59.208
No, we gotta move on
to a back up plan.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.250
What about that lady,
the bag lady,

10:01.250 --> 10:02.666
who saved all the cats?

10:02.666 --> 10:04.125
- Dogs.
- Whatever.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.625
- For the Christmas book?

10:05.625 --> 10:07.541
- Ah... I mean, nothing says
Christmas like...

10:07.541 --> 10:09.666
little puppies being saved
from an uncertain fate.

10:09.666 --> 10:12.708
- Warms the cockles.
- That it does. Make it happen.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.208
- Julianne.
- Chuga-chuga-chuga-chuga,

10:14.208 --> 10:16.708
that's the sound
of the puppy train.

10:16.708 --> 10:18.833
And the train is leaving
the station, you might
wanna climb on.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.125
- Stahl's book, it's important,
it's hopeful and original--

10:21.125 --> 10:22.500
Hey, look. I know you're all
"invested"

10:22.500 --> 10:24.291
and I know this is your "baby",

10:24.291 --> 10:26.750
but it's not mine and it never
was, you're gonna let it go.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.083
- Mr. Galvin asked for pages.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.625
- Let me break it down for you.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.166
- You can either...
fix me a latte and drop this?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.625
Or you can keep fighting
this losing battle

10:34.625 --> 10:36.500
and go home for good.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.291
- Erica.
- (Frustrated moan)

10:40.291 --> 10:42.708
- A word? The word is hari-kari.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.625
Don't do it, because I like you

10:44.625 --> 10:47.166
and I want you to stay, okay?

10:47.166 --> 10:48.958
Look, everybody has a breaking
point,

10:48.958 --> 10:51.500
and Julianne just hit it.
You may be right about Stahl-

10:51.500 --> 10:53.708
- No, Brent, I know that I'm
right.

10:53.708 --> 10:55.458
- No, you don't.

10:55.458 --> 10:58.666
And even if you did? It's
either his book or your job.

10:58.666 --> 11:01.291
Give in, Erica. Stahl did.

11:03.291 --> 11:05.291
- Fine.
- Good. I'm happy.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.666
Go make Julianne that latte,

11:10.666 --> 11:12.416
and ask her if she needs
help with that...

11:12.416 --> 11:15.333
bag lady/dog-memoir-thingy.
Okay?

11:18.083 --> 11:20.041
(Sighs)

11:20.041 --> 11:22.375
(Startled exhale)

11:26.291 --> 11:28.500
(Dr. Tom sighs)

11:30.333 --> 11:31.750
- You just gonna stand there?

11:31.750 --> 11:33.666
- Yes, I am. Because, uh...

11:33.666 --> 11:36.500
we're not doing this today.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.791
- "You can complain because
roses have thorns

11:38.791 --> 11:41.666
or you can rejoice because
thorns have roses."

11:41.666 --> 11:43.750
Zig Ziglar.
- Yeah, who's he?

11:43.750 --> 11:45.875
- Oh, God, I don't know.
I have no idea.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.750
The quote stuck though.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.416
Wow. You look tired.

11:52.416 --> 11:53.666
I am tired.

11:53.666 --> 11:56.000
My entire life is a mess.
my sister won't talk to me,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.291
"thank you" for that.
My boss wants to fire me,

11:58.291 --> 12:01.166
because God forbid
I actually have an opinion.

12:01.166 --> 12:03.541
And now here you are.

12:03.541 --> 12:05.916
But you know what, Dr. Tom?
I'm not doing it.

12:05.916 --> 12:08.750
Our therapy has been
a big step back,

12:08.750 --> 12:11.250
So the last thing I wanna do to
top off this crap-tacular day

12:11.250 --> 12:13.166
is a session. Believe me.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.625
- You done?

12:16.625 --> 12:18.208
- With all this? Yes, I am.

12:19.833 --> 12:21.541
- Well, where are you going?
- Back to work.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.416
- Oh, so you're gonna give up
then? (door rattles)

12:24.416 --> 12:26.875
- Well, it, uh, it seems
to be going around.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.958
- Erica, stop. Sit down.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.791
(Door rattles)
- (Yells) I said, stop!

12:34.125 --> 12:36.416
(Calming exhale)

12:39.791 --> 12:43.833
Sit.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.791
Please.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.958
Okay.

12:57.958 --> 13:00.583
So, you don't wanna back
and stare down another regret?

13:00.583 --> 13:03.291
Then you know what?
I understand that.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.916
So, I'll tell you what, maybe...

13:04.916 --> 13:06.750
I can send you somewhere else.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.625
- What do you mean?
- Well, you tell me.

13:08.625 --> 13:13.875
I mean, if you could return
to day, I mean any day...

13:13.875 --> 13:19.000
I mean, a good day,
what would that be?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.708
- Nothing is really
coming to mind right now.

13:23.875 --> 13:25.958
(Plate clunks)

13:25.958 --> 13:28.791
- You ever tasted a madeleine?

13:28.791 --> 13:30.833
Go, try one. Really.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.083
Marcel Proust believed
in involuntary memory.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.750
A single bite of one of those
little oval cakes there,

13:38.750 --> 13:42.833
(snaps fingers)
could send him back to the
blissful days of childhood.

13:42.833 --> 13:45.083
- The Proustian rush, I know.

13:45.083 --> 13:48.083
This cake is delicious.
- I know, isn't it?

13:48.083 --> 13:50.708
You know, revisiting
a good experience

13:50.708 --> 13:53.208
can sometimes be as beneficial
as returning to a bad one.

13:54.791 --> 13:57.250
- Well, that's good to know.
- Mm-hmm.

13:58.791 --> 14:00.291
Do me a favor, close your eyes.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.083
Go ahead.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.958
Now I want you to go
to the very back

14:06.958 --> 14:08.500
of the filing cabinet.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.625
And I want you to find me
a good day.

14:14.666 --> 14:17.708
A day when you...
made everything perfect.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.500
Now, that looks promising.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.333
- No, it's stupid.
- I can work with stupid.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.041
It's just a manner of speaking.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.000
- Okay, I remember this one day

14:31.000 --> 14:33.458
that I spent with my brother
and sister.

14:33.458 --> 14:36.333
Nothing big, we just...
took a ferry Toronto island.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.875
- Sounds fun.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.333
- Well, it didn't start off
that way.

14:39.333 --> 14:42.500
It started off with this
horrible, no-holds barred,

14:42.500 --> 14:45.916
battle royal between
my parents.

14:45.916 --> 14:47.875
Leo and Sam were traumatized,
so was I.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.375
So, I got the three of us
the hell out of there.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.958
(Seagulls cry)

14:58.583 --> 15:00.708
(Playful screams)
Wooo! Hey, Leo! Yeah!

15:00.708 --> 15:02.458
- We had all this steam
to blow off.

15:02.458 --> 15:03.875
And all that pent up energy,

15:03.875 --> 15:06.208
It made the day insanely fun.

15:06.208 --> 15:09.000
You know, nobody was telling us
what to do or how to behave.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.791
We just, we did whatever
we wanted to do,

15:10.791 --> 15:13.375
as often as we could stand it.
(Muted cries of joy)

15:15.458 --> 15:17.791
It was kind of like a glimpse
of how we all might've been

15:17.791 --> 15:20.458
if it wasn't for the baggage of
our parents weighing us down.

15:21.541 --> 15:25.833
We capped it off with this
amazing sunset cruise

15:25.833 --> 15:27.500
back to the city...

15:29.083 --> 15:32.666
and I remember thinking:
what a perfect day.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.541
It was everything that
this day is not.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.708
- And when you go back
this time?

15:45.708 --> 15:47.541
- I'm not gonna change a thing.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.541
- And so we rewind.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
(Jenga blocks clatter)
- Oh shit! (panting)

15:55.500 --> 15:58.541
Gary: I'm just calling it
like I see it.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.666
Barbara: (scoffs) A rabbi?!
- Yes, a rabbi.

16:01.666 --> 16:03.666
You've never recognized
my spiritual side.

16:03.666 --> 16:05.750
Barbara: Because I've never
seen it, Gary!

16:05.750 --> 16:08.708
Gary: ...insignificant little
world, nothing registers.

16:08.708 --> 16:11.333
It's the same stupid, self
centered, selfish bullshit!

16:12.833 --> 16:14.250
- He does not have to talk
to her--

16:14.250 --> 16:15.750
Erica: No, no, no. No, Leo.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.166
Leo, you do not want to do
this, okay?

16:17.166 --> 16:18.583
Just trust me.
Let's, let's just go.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.708
No, I mean it, okay,
you will regret it.

16:20.708 --> 16:22.625
Let's just get the hell
out of here, okay?

16:22.625 --> 16:24.833
- Please, Leo.

16:27.291 --> 16:30.583
Barbara: You take that back.
Gary: I am not gonna take it
back!

16:30.583 --> 16:32.083
You can give me the silent
treatment all you like,

16:32.083 --> 16:35.125
I don't give a shit!
Laugh, if you want.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.000
- Call it like you see, Gary!

16:37.000 --> 16:39.625
What about me?
What about the way I see it?

16:39.625 --> 16:42.166
Have you ever considered that?

16:42.166 --> 16:43.583
- I swear, sometimes I hate him.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.083
- No you don't.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.458
- Well, how do you know
what I think?

16:46.458 --> 16:48.333
- Hey, Leo, just calm down.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.458
No, you should have let me
go at him and make my point.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.541
I don't need you babysitting me.

16:52.541 --> 16:54.041
- Look, I'm not babysitting you,

16:54.041 --> 16:55.541
I'm just trying to protect you.

16:55.541 --> 16:58.125
- Babysitting.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.875
Look, Dad's giving up on mom,
he's pushing her away.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.791
Sam: Leo, please, stop.

17:02.791 --> 17:04.166
- Hey, you guys, you know what?

17:04.166 --> 17:06.166
Let's just enjoy today?

17:06.166 --> 17:08.750
Mom and dad and all their crap
are back there and...

17:08.750 --> 17:10.666
here we are!

17:10.666 --> 17:12.875
Trust me, today is gonna be
super fun!

17:12.875 --> 17:15.041
- And you're super gay.

17:15.041 --> 17:17.458
- You know, Leo, you really
shouldn't say that,

17:17.458 --> 17:18.958
it's offensive.

17:18.958 --> 17:20.458
- Offensive?
- Yeah.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.708
(Half laughs)
Oh, now you're just retarded.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.541
And I don't understand
why we're going here?

17:24.541 --> 17:26.541
Anywhere we could go in Toronto,

17:26.541 --> 17:28.208
and we're going to the island?

17:28.208 --> 17:29.708
You know it's a garbage dump,
right?

17:29.708 --> 17:31.250
- It's not a garbage dump.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.958
- Is it really a garbage dump?

17:32.958 --> 17:34.708
We're going swimming
in a garbage dump?

17:34.708 --> 17:36.125
- No, okay, there's a little
bit of landfill.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.041
(Leo spits)
- Aw, Leo.

17:38.041 --> 17:40.333
- Leo, Can you not do that?

17:40.333 --> 17:41.916
And get-you know what?
Get down from the edge.

17:41.916 --> 17:43.500
- What, this edge?

17:43.500 --> 17:46.958
- Come on.
- Jeez. You're so annoying
today.

17:46.958 --> 17:48.625
Well, look, I will be less
annoying

17:48.625 --> 17:51.416
If you just sit down here
with your sisters.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.875
Sam, what're you doing?

17:56.875 --> 17:58.750
- Putting on baby oil.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.041
Amelia says that's how
all the Baywatch girls

18:00.041 --> 18:01.916
get their sexy California look.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.875
- No, that's how you get
melanoma.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.041
And the only thing worse
than skin cancer

18:06.041 --> 18:08.625
is wrinkles, believe me.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.958
What, SPF 9, that's it?
Oh, well. Leo?

18:13.458 --> 18:15.958
Okay.

18:15.958 --> 18:17.750
- What do-
- There you go.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.750
You're violating me and
freaking me out. Majorly.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.291
- You're right, I'll just-
I'll just chillax.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.541
- Chill-what?
- Nothing.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.208
Don't have a cow, dude.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.708
(Ship horn honks)

18:31.708 --> 18:33.958
- Where is Leo?
I mean, he was right here.

18:33.958 --> 18:36.166
Leo: Yo, Beavis and Butthead,
wait up!

18:36.166 --> 18:38.208
Erica: Hey, Leo,
watch, there's kids.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.958
- Look, mom, no eyes! Woo!
Leo, watch out!

18:40.958 --> 18:43.250
- All right, woo!

18:43.250 --> 18:45.666
- Sam, are you okay?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.500
- Oh, that doesn't feel good.

18:52.333 --> 18:55.791
- Sorry.
- Mini golf?

changes,

25:02.583 --> 25:05.083

little bit, I freaked out.

25:05.083 --> 25:08.375

25:08.375 --> 25:10.625
Quantum mechanics.

25:10.625 --> 25:13.416
You see, we can never know
with any kind of certainty,

25:13.416 --> 25:16.083
how an atom will behave
naturally.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.916
Because the instant
that we look at an atom,

25:20.541 --> 25:22.458
we alter it.

25:24.208 --> 25:27.916
The very act of looking
is never a passive thing.

25:27.916 --> 25:29.541
It has an affect.

25:29.541 --> 25:31.625
In fact, physicists tell us

25:31.625 --> 25:34.708
that reality at its deepest
level

25:34.708 --> 25:38.083

hurrah before Leo...

25:55.291 --> 25:57.791
Before Leo died.
And now it's ruined.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.708
All I wanted to do, was relive
today exactly as it was.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.208
But just being here,
it changed it.

26:05.208 --> 26:06.750

another mess.

that I know you have learned
in our short time together,

26:15.750 --> 26:18.666
it's that...
life is about choices.

26:19.125 --> 26:22.000
Everyday, every moment,
is a choice.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.208

26:25.208 --> 26:27.208
what's your choice gonna
be here?

29:28.708 --> 29:30.500
- (Breathless laugh) I, uh...
I have a confession to make.

29:32.041 --> 29:34.958
My name's not Tiger, it's Leo.

29:34.958 --> 29:36.833
- It's Leo the lion?
That's even better.

29:38.708 --> 29:40.625
Leo: (small moan) Whoa.

29:43.666 --> 29:45.750
Incoming roid rage
at four o'clock.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.958
- Whoops.
- Oh, you know him?

29:47.958 --> 29:50.708
- Um... That would be Alex.
That's my boyfriend.

29:54.916 --> 29:56.958
- Oh my God! Oh my God,
oh my God!

29:56.958 --> 29:59.625
- Baby. Baby. No, baby, no, no!
No, baby, don't!

30:02.541 --> 30:05.041
Sam: Yup, Leo is definitely
at the nude beach.

30:05.041 --> 30:07.041
- No problemo, it's not
the last ferry.

30:07.041 --> 30:08.875
Just the last ferry
with the best view ever.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.541
Leo: Run for it!

30:12.541 --> 30:15.666
Tina: Alex! Alex, chill!
It's not that big of a deal!

30:15.666 --> 30:17.166
Leo: Erica, hurry up!

30:17.166 --> 30:18.916
- Hey! Leave my brother alone,
you got it?

30:18.916 --> 30:20.875
(Hard slap, Alex grunts)

30:20.875 --> 30:22.208
Don't mess with the babysitter.

30:23.833 --> 30:25.916
(Heavy breaths)
- That girl just-- (Slap)

30:25.916 --> 30:28.500
Amber told me that you
made out with Tiffany
from the whack-a-mole.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.791
Now you know how it feels!

30:30.791 --> 30:33.458
- Oh, honey. Are you okay?
- No.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.208
- (Laughs, panting)

30:37.208 --> 30:38.625
- Leo, are you okay?

30:38.625 --> 30:40.791
- I'm cool.

30:40.791 --> 30:42.416
Let me tell you, sis?

30:42.416 --> 30:45.708
You rocked hard.

30:45.708 --> 30:47.416
Good day.

30:47.416 --> 30:50.625
- Great day.
- Perfect day.

(Leo laughs, front door shuts)

31:25.708 --> 31:27.625
- Mom, dad, you should have
been there.

31:27.625 --> 31:29.416
We had such a fun day.

31:31.041 --> 31:32.750
- I'm glad someone
had a great day.

31:32.750 --> 31:36.041
(Photo album slaps shut)

31:43.583 --> 31:45.500

31:45.500 --> 31:47.583
mom and dad are gonna get
divorced?

31:47.583 --> 31:49.625
- No. No, they're just...

31:51.916 --> 31:54.916
they're just going through
a rough patch.

31:54.916 --> 31:57.666
- We know that's not true.

31:59.666 --> 32:01.791
But it'll be okay, Sam.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.958
- No, it will.

32:05.958 --> 32:09.958
Our parents may be psycho,
but I'm not going anywhere.

32:12.125 --> 32:14.958
Neither is Erica, right?

32:14.958 --> 32:18.166
- You got it.

32:18.166 --> 32:20.833
Well, I don't know about you
guys, but I am starving

32:20.833 --> 32:23.000
'cause I left everything
I ate on the island.

32:26.333 --> 32:27.750
(Wrapper crinkles)

32:29.291 --> 32:30.791
(Startled gasps)
- Oh my God.

32:30.791 --> 32:32.666
Do not sneak up on me
like that ever again.

32:32.666 --> 32:34.958
- Sorry, I was just about
to make Julianne her latte.

32:34.958 --> 32:37.916
- Yeah uh, Julianne doesn't
take drain cleaner in her latte.

32:37.916 --> 32:40.000
- Um, hey, Brent.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.916
How long has it been since,
um, we last talked there?

32:43.541 --> 32:45.041
Why are you looking
at me like that?

32:45.041 --> 32:47.458
- I'm just trying to see
if you're having a seizure.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.083
Do you smell burnt toast?

32:49.083 --> 32:51.708
- Look, Brent, I need you
to cover for me.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.958
- No, you need to bring
Julianne her latte.

32:53.958 --> 32:55.583
She's thirsty and cranky.

32:55.583 --> 32:56.958
And I need to speak
to the art department

32:56.958 --> 32:58.291
About a cover for the cat lady
book.

32:58.291 --> 33:01.250
- Dog lady book.
- Whatever.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.083
Mm, my God, my Kung Fu
is strong.

33:03.083 --> 33:04.625
- Look, I'm sure it is,
but, Brent,

33:04.625 --> 33:06.250
You need to cover for me, okay?
'cause there's something--

33:06.250 --> 33:08.625
- You haven't said anything
I said earlier, did you?

33:08.625 --> 33:10.541
- No, I did. And I should
probably follow your advice,

33:10.541 --> 33:12.125
but I'm not really thinking
with my head right now.

33:12.125 --> 33:14.041
Please, come on, come on,
please-please-please.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.666
- If things turns out the way
I think they will,

33:17.666 --> 33:19.458
I call dibs on your ergonomic
chair.

33:19.458 --> 33:21.541
And your orchids.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.583
And your colored paper clips!
- Okay.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.791
Hello?!

33:31.791 --> 33:34.625
Mr. Stahl?

33:34.625 --> 33:38.291
Um, um, it's Erica Strange
from River Rock Publishing.

33:38.291 --> 33:40.833
I just, I let myself in,
I hope that's okay?

33:42.291 --> 33:44.041
Mr. Stahl?

33:44.041 --> 33:46.208
I-I just, uh...

33:46.208 --> 33:50.125
Came over to see if you needed
any help with the manuscript?

33:50.125 --> 33:51.500
Hello?!

33:53.875 --> 33:55.750
(Folder crinkles)

33:55.750 --> 33:57.750
(Shocked gasp)

33:57.750 --> 34:00.625
What do you mean you haven't
written anything?

34:00.625 --> 34:03.041
There's gotta be four chapters
here.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.833
Mr. Stahl, I knew that
you could do it,

34:04.833 --> 34:06.583
I knew that you could face...

34:11.625 --> 34:13.875
Mr. Stahl?

34:13.875 --> 34:15.500
Marcus!

34:17.000 --> 34:18.833
Oh God. Marcus!

34:20.250 --> 34:21.958
Marcus.

34:21.958 --> 34:24.083
Marcus, can you hear me?

34:26.875 --> 34:28.875
(Keypad beeps)

34:28.875 --> 34:31.833
Marcus. Marcus.

34:31.833 --> 34:35.208
Oh, shit. Oh, shit-shit-shit.

34:35.708 --> 34:37.875
It's 459 Arbour Street.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.458
I think he may have overdosed.

34:40.458 --> 34:43.333
There was-I mean, there was
cocaine and pills and, I, I...

34:43.333 --> 34:46.166
I forgot how to do all this
stuff, just please hurry.

34:46.166 --> 34:48.250
Mr. Stahl, please wake up.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.125
(Hard slap, stunned gasp)

34:50.125 --> 34:52.666
Oh God, he's awake. He's...

34:52.666 --> 34:55.708
Oh God. Oh, thank God.
- (Coughs)

34:57.416 --> 35:00.166
- (Heavy breathing, coughs)
- Marcus. It's okay.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.083
You're gonna be okay.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.500
(Gurney rattles)

35:17.833 --> 35:19.708
(Half laughs to herself)

35:22.916 --> 35:26.208
(Pen clicks)
- Sam.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.750
Hey, Sam. Wait-wait.
Hey, just talk to me.

35:28.750 --> 35:31.000
- What are you doing here?
Because I told dad earlier--

35:31.000 --> 35:33.125
- No, no, one of our authors,
he overdosed.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.791
- Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

35:36.666 --> 35:39.000
- Oh, come on, Sam,
we're sisters.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.750
Are we, are we really
never gonna to talk again?

35:40.750 --> 35:42.875
- Exactly, Erica, we're sisters.

35:42.875 --> 35:45.291
We are supposed to love each
other and support each other--

35:45.291 --> 35:47.208
- And forgive each other.

35:49.958 --> 35:52.833
- Do you still feel
the same way about Josh?

35:52.833 --> 35:55.458
- Yes.
- Then I can't forgive you.

35:57.041 --> 35:58.833
It's simple, you forced me
to choose

35:58.833 --> 36:00.791
between my sister and
my husband

36:00.791 --> 36:02.375
and I made my choice.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.625
- I didn't ask you to choose.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.250
So, that's it?

36:10.250 --> 36:12.125
- That's it.

36:13.583 --> 36:15.208
- Fine.

36:17.166 --> 36:19.916
Hey, Sam.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.875
When the day comes
that you do need me,

36:21.875 --> 36:24.916
and it will come,
I'll be there for you.

36:24.916 --> 36:27.125
Say what you want,
you're my sister.

36:27.125 --> 36:29.958
We've lost Leo
and I refuse to lose you.

36:37.333 --> 36:44.083
♪ ♪

36:44.083 --> 36:46.166
- Rehab again.

36:47.750 --> 36:50.041
- Is there anything
that I can do?

36:50.041 --> 36:52.250
- Well, don't you think
you've done enough?

36:53.750 --> 36:55.958
(Both half laugh)

36:55.958 --> 36:58.041
- Don't worry, I'll be fine.

37:00.083 --> 37:03.250
Look, I've done it before,
I can do it again.

37:03.250 --> 37:05.708
Only this time, I'll be busier.

37:08.333 --> 37:10.916
I have a book to write.

37:10.916 --> 37:12.625
- Mm-hmm.

37:12.625 --> 37:14.583
- (Chuckles)

37:16.708 --> 37:19.125
Thank you.

37:22.166 --> 37:25.083
- So, she didn't make my latte?
And she didn't go home?

37:25.083 --> 37:28.083
She went to Stahl's house?
What, to hold his hand?

37:28.083 --> 37:30.333
- Until he finished
the first chapters.

37:30.333 --> 37:32.250
- Why?! We don't want
his writing!

37:32.250 --> 37:34.208
We want the goddamn cat lady!

37:34.208 --> 37:37.250
- Dog lady.
- Whatever.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.875
(Nervous exhale) Frank.

37:38.875 --> 37:40.208
Just the man I was hoping
to see.

37:40.208 --> 37:43.041
- Julianne, Stahl's pages?

37:43.041 --> 37:46.041
We agreed they would be
on my desk by day's end, yes?

37:46.041 --> 37:48.166
- Uh, Stahl has... stalled.

37:50.041 --> 37:52.375
- What happened?

37:52.375 --> 37:55.375
- An old habit reappeared,
if you know what I mean.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.250
- Frank. Frank, I...

37:59.250 --> 38:01.333
I have prepared an incredible
plan b.

38:03.041 --> 38:04.833
And I'm, I'm stoked.

38:04.833 --> 38:06.791
I have some excellent ideas
for the cover

38:06.791 --> 38:10.208
of our new feel good
Christmas title, okay?

38:10.208 --> 38:13.375
(Clears throat)
Imagine a grubby hand reaching
into a fire

38:13.375 --> 38:15.541
to pull out fuzzy little
kittens...

38:15.541 --> 38:18.375
- I got 'em! Stahl's pages.
And they're good.

38:18.375 --> 38:21.125
(Stammers) They're very good.

38:21.125 --> 38:24.208
- From what I hear, the man's
in no condition to write.

38:24.208 --> 38:27.916
- Um, which is why he's, uh...
going off to rehab, sir.

38:27.916 --> 38:30.416
Rehab? Oh, do you really think
that's gonna make us feel all
peachy?

38:30.416 --> 38:33.125
It should because he's...
he's facing his problems.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.958
- Fab, but I told you,
we're moving on.

38:35.958 --> 38:37.916
- Please, please don't give up
on this.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.833
- Erica, drop it.

38:39.833 --> 38:42.250
- Mr. Galvin, you know... Stahl.

38:42.250 --> 38:44.541
And I mean, he is not a quitter.

38:44.541 --> 38:46.291
I mean, his whole life
has proven that.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.416
And he, he just told me,
he promised me,

38:48.416 --> 38:51.500
that he will come out
of rehab with a book,

38:51.500 --> 38:54.333
if you could please
just take a look at this.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.250
You'll see, it's...
it's really good.

39:01.416 --> 39:03.375
- Well, we can't risk depending
on Stahl's book,

39:03.375 --> 39:05.375
and having it not come through.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.000
Christmas is our big season,
my dear,

39:07.000 --> 39:08.958
And we can't be left
holding the bag.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.916
That's why we're gonna develop
both books concurrently.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.458
Julianne.
- But, Frank.

39:15.458 --> 39:17.291
Put someone on the dog lady.

39:17.291 --> 39:18.750
If Stahl's book is ready
in time,

39:18.750 --> 39:20.583
it becomes a Christmas launch,
if not,

39:20.583 --> 39:23.583
dog lady takes its place.

39:23.583 --> 39:27.375
You're right.
Stahl isn't a quitter.

39:27.375 --> 39:29.958
If he was, we wouldn't be
doing a book about him.

39:29.958 --> 39:32.750
- Frank?
- Make it happen, Julianne.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.708
- Thank you, Mr. Galvin.

39:41.416 --> 39:43.166
(Relieved exhales)

39:50.500 --> 39:51.875
Would you like a latte?

39:53.541 --> 39:56.166
- Look at you. You could get
a job at Starbucks.

39:56.166 --> 39:58.208
- Yeah, well, I might have to
if they hate Stahl's writing,

39:58.208 --> 40:00.625
but I just, I couldn't let go.

40:00.625 --> 40:02.958
I couldn't give up.
- Oh, you could.

40:02.958 --> 40:05.291
- I almost did, but it wouldn't
be right.

40:05.291 --> 40:07.958
- Mm. Oh.

40:07.958 --> 40:10.083
- How much do they pay
at Starbucks, anyways?

40:10.083 --> 40:12.333
- "We can not, we will not,
choose the path of surrender."

40:12.333 --> 40:14.125
Woodrow T. Wilson.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.458
- I, uh, I checked the temp
on the espresso

40:17.458 --> 40:19.458
and the milk is extra hot.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.375
- I read Stahl's chapters,
Erica.

40:23.083 --> 40:24.625
- Wow, that was, uh,
that was fast.

40:24.625 --> 40:26.958
- Well, Frank demanded it.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.625
And turns out you're right,
they're not bad.

40:29.625 --> 40:31.833
- Oh? Well, that,
I mean, that's great.

40:33.458 --> 40:36.541
Okay, do not let what I'm about
to say go to your head.

40:36.541 --> 40:39.166
- I promise.

40:39.166 --> 40:41.666
- I'm impressed.

40:41.666 --> 40:43.500
You have fought for a property
that you cared about,

40:43.500 --> 40:45.333
despite all the nay-sayers.

40:45.333 --> 40:47.625
And... you were right to.

40:47.625 --> 40:50.458
Stahl needs more time,
he'll get it.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.541
Hmm.

40:52.541 --> 40:53.833
(Sips latte and groans)

40:55.375 --> 40:58.208
This makes me less impressed.

40:58.208 --> 41:00.083
- (Clears throat) Right.

41:04.541 --> 41:06.541
Hi, Ryan, it's me.

41:06.541 --> 41:08.500
Um... listen, I'm sorry
about earlier.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.875
Uh, tomorrow night sounds great.

41:10.875 --> 41:12.541
And... (deep inhale)

41:12.541 --> 41:14.375
I hope that you're
having fun with Josh

41:14.375 --> 41:16.083
and give me a call.

41:16.083 --> 41:18.541
Oh!

41:18.541 --> 41:19.958
(Surprised gasp)

41:22.208 --> 41:23.833
- Heirloom tomatoes.
My secret weapon.

41:25.375 --> 41:28.083
- Um... how did you get
in here?

41:28.083 --> 41:31.125
- I bribed your building manager
with promises of leftovers.

41:31.125 --> 41:32.625
(Timer dings)

41:32.625 --> 41:34.000
- Oh, crap, my pine nuts
are burning.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.333
- (Laughs)

41:36.333 --> 41:38.833
So, what happened
to your plans with Josh?

41:40.250 --> 41:43.750
- (French accent) I called him,
told him I changed my mind.

41:43.750 --> 41:45.583
And then I tried to think
of this creative way

41:45.583 --> 41:47.916
to make it up to you.

41:47.916 --> 41:50.333
- Mmm, well...

41:50.333 --> 41:52.875
Uh, the apron? Did the trick.

41:56.583 --> 41:58.875
♪ Leaving with this weight
on my shoulders ♪

42:00.541 --> 42:04.333
Erica: They say the greatest
mistake is giving up.

42:04.333 --> 42:07.125
That true strength lies
in the will to keep trying.

42:10.750 --> 42:12.583
Keep hoping things will
get better.

42:15.458 --> 42:16.875
Keep reminding yourself
of all you've accomplished.

42:22.250 --> 42:24.750
Keep everything in perspective.

42:24.750 --> 42:29.541

might stand against me ♪

42:29.541 --> 42:31.375

42:47.750 --> 42:49.250
Erica: Because at the end
of the day,

42:49.250 --> 42:51.625
that's what you're left with;

42:51.625 --> 42:54.375
the knowledge that you did
your best

42:54.375 --> 42:56.958
and that you wake up tomorrow
and try again.
