<i>...gaming and tourism
has been cold</i>

01:00.094 --> 01:02.127
<i>for the entire month
of December</i>

01:02.129 --> 01:06.465
<i>while temperatures
are nearing record highs...</i>

01:21.181 --> 01:22.548
<i>A diet Pepsi, please.</i>

01:35.196 --> 01:36.395
Thank you.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.493
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.894
The roulette pit
was a zoo tonight.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.597
Two Haitians got drunk,
one of them

02:11.599 --> 02:14.533
- tried to urinate on me...
- Let's get out of here.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.768
Doris, I just arrived.

02:16.770 --> 02:21.507
I picked this place
'cause it's deserted,
you know? We can think.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.910
This is our future
we're talkin' about now.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.312
Sweetheart, I don't
mean to pressure you,

02:27.314 --> 02:30.182
but the Caesars people
have offered me

02:30.184 --> 02:32.584
a roulette pit of my own
in Atlantic City.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.319
That's a big break.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.555
And tomorrow's my deadline
for telling them yes or no,

02:36.557 --> 02:38.690
so you gotta
tell me tonight.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.860
Will you come with me?

02:41.862 --> 02:44.696
That's not what you mean
when you say, "come with me."

02:44.698 --> 02:48.700
You mean, "Come live with me,
then love me, then marry me."

02:48.702 --> 02:51.904
Yes, and have children.
Is that so awful?

02:51.906 --> 02:54.273
Come on, Osgood,
I've been married
three times.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.841
I suck at it.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.578
- You just haven't found...
- <i> Let's dance.</i>

02:59.580 --> 03:01.246
You and me,
just you and me.
Come on.

03:01.248 --> 03:02.881
- I don't want to dance.
- We're talking here.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.816
All right?

03:04.818 --> 03:07.219
- Let's go, come on.
- Hey, hey!

03:07.221 --> 03:10.556
- Excuse me!
- Let go! Let go!

03:10.558 --> 03:12.925
Look, buddy, I don't think
you want to make me mad.

03:12.927 --> 03:15.294
I don't care what games
you two want to play...

03:15.296 --> 03:17.896
That's twice now
you've touched her.
Don't do it again!

03:17.898 --> 03:21.600
I won't touch her again...
until she asks me.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.438
I got one question.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.840
Is it all right
if I touch you?

03:28.842 --> 03:31.310
- Ay, Osgood!
- Oh, dear, look at...

03:31.312 --> 03:32.711
Give me that!

03:32.713 --> 03:34.580
- I fuckin' knew it.
- Give me that!

03:34.582 --> 03:36.248
- Hey!
- All you gotta do
is come and get it.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.482
It's mine
and I want it.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.851
God damn it,
be careful with that!

03:39.853 --> 03:41.787
- Come on, let's go.
Take me out of here.
- That cost a lot of money,

03:41.789 --> 03:43.622
- I had it made special.
- Fuck the money, Osgood!

03:43.624 --> 03:45.824
Osgood?

03:45.826 --> 03:47.993
No one's got a fuckin'
name like Osgood.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.295
- Jesus.
- Son of a bitch.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.931
Come on. Let's go,
I'm scared.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.733
-<i> Who the fuck's</i>
got a name like Osgood?
- You don't have to be scared.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.935
I can't help it.
That guy...

03:56.937 --> 03:58.904
- I could've handled him.
- You don't want this?

03:58.906 --> 04:02.307
<i>I know.</i>
- Is it house trained?

04:04.644 --> 04:06.845
God damn it!

04:09.415 --> 04:11.583
I try to behave
like a gentleman, Doris.

04:11.585 --> 04:15.454
I really do, you know,
but there's an animal
side to everybody.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.623
You think less of me,
don't you? For walking out.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.024
Please, how can you
even say that?

04:19.026 --> 04:21.026
I was the one who dragged
you out of there.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.595
I say that 'cause
I think it's the truth.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.933
- Osgood.
- No, no, no! Walk me
to the car, please.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.670
- - Come back! Come over
here, mate.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.938
<i>I'll brought
your hamster back!</i>

04:32.940 --> 04:36.408
Ozzie, wozzie, wozzie.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.644
<i>- Osgood.</i>
<i>- </i> God damn it!

04:38.646 --> 04:40.779
That's enough!

04:40.781 --> 04:43.715
Hey, look, I don't
want this no more.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.384
I wouldn't know
what to feed it.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.619
<i>Osgood,</i>
come back!

04:48.655 --> 04:50.656
<i>Osgood, please!</i>

04:54.861 --> 04:56.728
Oops.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.831
- Move back.
- Move back, why?

04:59.833 --> 05:02.901
Safety precaution,
let's say.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.870
I don't need no tricks

05:04.872 --> 05:08.740
to deal with a pee-wee
shrimp fag like you.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.909
All I need is my hands.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.758
- <i> Osgood...</i>
- Shut up!

05:26.760 --> 05:30.996
- But I...
- Close your god damn
mouth, Doris.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.831
<i>No one is leaving
till it's over,</i>

05:32.833 --> 05:36.401
and it isn't over
till you say it is.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.374
It's over.

05:42.376 --> 05:45.677
Help me up, okay?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.646
You know what
you are, pal?

05:47.648 --> 05:51.550
You're a coward,
and your breath stinks!

05:58.658 --> 06:00.792
No, no, I'm a mess.
I'm a mess.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.961
You're my own little hero.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.784
<i>Coming through,
coming through!</i>

08:43.823 --> 08:46.958
<i>- Drew, what happened?</i>
- Found her in the parking lot.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.894
She's in and out.
Stand clear.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.629
<i>Can you tell me your name?</i>

08:54.166 --> 08:55.667
Nick...

08:55.669 --> 08:56.749
<i>Do you have any allergies?</i>

08:58.771 --> 09:00.906
Tell me who did this to you.
Who did this to you?

09:00.908 --> 09:03.642
Sweetheart, can you tell me
who did this to you?

09:03.644 --> 09:07.078
Nick...

09:09.916 --> 09:11.182
Nick...

09:11.184 --> 09:13.618
Nick.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.859
<i>Well, I never thought
you'd make it in, huh?</i>

11:00.861 --> 11:04.095
Isn't this the 5,000th morning
in the Athens of America?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.031
Five fuckin' thousandth morning.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.899
How you survivin'?

11:09.435 --> 11:11.269
- Eh, you know.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.704
Here.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.240
- Nut mail?
- It looks like it.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.841
I'm not up to it, Pinky.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.411
Read it to me.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.813
All right.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.683
Let the games begin.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.317
How about... a-ha.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.788
"Mr. Wild, how can I become
a mercenary like you?

11:29.790 --> 11:32.090
If someone were
hypothetically interested

11:32.092 --> 11:34.359
in creating a small explosion,

11:34.361 --> 11:37.462
<i>how would one hypothetically
research such a thing</i>

11:37.464 --> 11:40.265
without leaving
a computer trail? Thanks.

11:40.267 --> 11:44.069
This is research for
a hypothetical screenplay."

11:44.071 --> 11:47.205
Hypothetically,
I wouldn't answer this guy.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.940
Great advice, Pinky.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.945
- - Oh, good morning.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.181
Pinchus Zion,
attorney at law.

11:56.183 --> 11:59.718
- How can I help you?
- Cyrus Kinnick, looking
for a Nick Wild.

12:03.089 --> 12:04.489
He's right behind you.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.759
<i>Nick?
This is Cyrus Kinnick.</i>

12:07.761 --> 12:08.960
Thank you.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.129
Hello, Mr. Wild.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.364
<i>I was thinking of hitting
the casino tonight.</i>

12:13.366 --> 12:14.966
I wish I could
help you, pal.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.835
You gotta be 21.
They'll lose their license.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.203
I'm 23 years old,

12:18.205 --> 12:20.038
but my youthful appearance
is one of the reasons

12:20.040 --> 12:21.840
why I believe
I need a bodyguard.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.108
May I be frank?

12:24.276 --> 12:26.511
Grab a seat.

12:29.281 --> 12:32.083
I looked you up on
an online guide to Vegas
but you weren't in it.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.786
That bothers me.

12:34.788 --> 12:38.089
See, I'm a considerable gambler,

12:38.091 --> 12:39.491
if that isn't being
too boastful

12:39.493 --> 12:41.326
and safety means
much to me.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.194
I checked under every
synonym for safety,

12:43.196 --> 12:45.363
but there was
no Nick Wild.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.399
Well, you should've
tried between "chapels"
and "charm schools".

12:48.401 --> 12:50.835
<i>I don't want to</i>
<i>be</i>
<i>too boastful either,</i>
<i>Mr. Kinnick,</i>

12:50.837 --> 12:54.205
but you're talking
to the only chaperone
in all of Nevada.

12:54.207 --> 12:58.309
See, now, I'm confused.
I was referred to you
by an ex-client.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.345
He was a neighbor
of mine in Boston.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.113
<i>I simply took him
off his advice,</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:04.115
<i>but now I fear you
may be too jocular.</i>

13:05.284 --> 13:07.152
Could you tell me
about yourself?

13:07.154 --> 13:10.021
You mean, you want
my qualifications?

13:10.023 --> 13:12.791
Along those lines.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.260
Along those lines.

13:17.897 --> 13:21.432
Well, I've been knocked down,
blown up, lied to, shit on,

13:21.434 --> 13:22.901
and shot at.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.569
So nothing surprises
me much anymore,

13:24.571 --> 13:26.938
except the things
that people do
to each other.

13:26.940 --> 13:31.376
I'm a licensed pilot,
took karate in Tokyo.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.545
I lectured on economics at Yale.

13:33.547 --> 13:34.913
I can memorize the front pages

13:34.915 --> 13:36.381
of the New York Times
in five minutes

13:36.383 --> 13:38.483
<i>and repeat it back
to you in five weeks.</i>

13:38.485 --> 13:41.986
I was the National
Golden Gloves champion
three years in a row.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.822
I'm fluent in four languages

13:43.824 --> 13:45.824
and can wrestle with
a menu in five more...

13:45.826 --> 13:47.859
- Jesus!
- Don't interrupt me.
There's more.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.861
- More?
- Yeah.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.363
I lie a lot.

14:03.242 --> 14:07.078
I'm staying
at Caesars, Mr. Wild.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.213
Shall we say 7:00?

14:09.615 --> 14:12.250
7:00, Mr. Kinnick.

14:37.309 --> 14:40.378
It worked, Nicky!

14:40.380 --> 14:44.249
It fuckin' worked!
It really worked.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.451
How could you be such
a bastard Os, huh?

14:46.453 --> 14:48.620
You said I was a coward
and my breath was bad.

14:48.622 --> 14:50.655
That's not an insult,
that's a fuckin' insult.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.423
That was in character, man.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.592
I'm fuckin' around.
You're too sensitive.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.262
And you didn't tell me
you were gonna take
my fuckin' hair.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.163
- What was that, man?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.398
She likes you
better without it.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.269
Heh, women,
they like honesty.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.905
Who knew?
Word to the wise.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.474
All right, fresh
from the bank...

15:09.476 --> 15:12.543
- one thousand dollars.
- That's not the right amount.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.346
Are you callin' me a crook?
'Cause I am not a crook.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.381
Nobody said you were.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.016
You forgot the bonus, Nicky!

15:18.018 --> 15:19.918
I said if she came along
out of pressure

15:19.920 --> 15:22.520
I was putting on, fine.
Whatever. Done.

15:22.522 --> 15:25.156
But if by seeing
the real me,

15:25.158 --> 15:27.926
it could bring out
that she loved me,

15:27.928 --> 15:31.162
there'd be a
$500 bonus. $1,000.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.465
And that's what happened?
She saw the real you?

15:34.467 --> 15:38.202
She fuckin' loves me, man.

15:38.204 --> 15:40.471
Love.

15:49.715 --> 15:53.151
I'll take the $500, Os.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.455
This day keeps gettin'
better and better.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.095
I love you, man.
I mean, I love you.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.596
Yeah!

16:05.598 --> 16:09.100
<i>Hey, I'm gonna write you
from Atlantic City.</i>

16:09.102 --> 16:11.569
It's where we'll all headed.
How you doin', Nick?

16:11.571 --> 16:13.504
Oh, great, Rox.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.309
So, I put Casanova
on table two like you asked.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.678
I'll bet you give him the room
with the busted toilet.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.014
Oh, yeah,
I like that one.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.149
<i>- I'm not wearing a ring.
- You wouldn't have known it.</i>

16:25.151 --> 16:28.353
I stay with her on account
of our four kids
and I can survive,

16:28.355 --> 16:30.755
except when fate,
through a toilet
that won't flush,

16:30.757 --> 16:37.495
brings me in contact
with a special specimen
like you.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.031
- What'd I miss?
- The special specimen.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.633
- Fuck!
- Shh, he's about
to ask for a memory.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.302
Okay, she's dead,
but she won't lie down.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.004
Oh, she'll lie down.
She just doesn't realize

16:46.006 --> 16:48.639
it's gonna happen
in five minutes.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.509
<i>I could get a key
to a $1,000 suite.</i>

16:51.511 --> 16:54.779
So please, Marie,
leave me with the memory.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.149
Give me something
I can cherish to remember.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.018
Okay.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.687
Okay. Thank you.
Come on.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.790
Son of a bitch!
How does he get
fucked every time?

17:05.791 --> 17:08.559
- What is that?
- Hey, he wants it that much.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.328
Well, I don't have
anything like that.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.130
- Do you?
- Sure.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.665
Never ever to rest my head
on the same pillow twice.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.434
- Well, travel costs.
- Tell me.

17:16.435 --> 17:20.371
I need $500,000
to buy me five years.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.674
Right now, I'm only
short $499,500.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.810
- Well, luck will
find you then.
- I know.

17:25.811 --> 17:28.413
When it does,
I'll grab that fucker
by the throat.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.781
Yeah.

17:49.701 --> 17:52.537
Oh, and hey, Nick?
Holly just called.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.539
Said if you're not finished
with your grapefruit juice,

17:54.541 --> 17:57.408
- don't waste it.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.656
<i>It's open.</i>

18:16.595 --> 18:19.730
- <i> You want some coffee?</i>
- No.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.732
<i>I just brewed it.</i>

18:21.734 --> 18:26.170
<i>It's 100% Colombian,
it's right there on the table.</i>

18:26.172 --> 18:29.572
Holly, if you're gonna hide,
why couldn't we have just
talked on the phone?

18:31.210 --> 18:34.612
<i>I just don't think I want
you seeing me like this.</i>

18:53.832 --> 18:55.600
Hey, Nick.

19:08.280 --> 19:13.217
You know, I kept calling out
for you in emergency.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.356
The doctor says I kept saying
"Nick" over and over again.

19:20.759 --> 19:22.759
They thought that you
were the one who...

19:23.729 --> 19:26.197
Who did?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.934
I don't know.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.639
That's why I phoned you.

19:40.746 --> 19:44.182
<i>So I had a date
last night.</i>

19:44.184 --> 19:47.218
When I left, I got
to the elevator

19:47.220 --> 19:50.321
and the doors were opening
and it was going up.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.651
There were three guys inside.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.361
The young guy was the boss.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.364
He spoke real strong,
like a fighter.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.833
The two big guys
were his flunkies.

20:02.835 --> 20:07.838
And the fighter says,
"Come on to the party."

20:07.840 --> 20:10.875
And I said I was tired,
and he said,

20:10.877 --> 20:13.578
"Hey, I'm too pretty
to turn down."

20:13.580 --> 20:19.417
And he pulled me inside and...

20:19.419 --> 20:24.555
We get to his suite,
I said, "Where's the party?"

20:27.359 --> 20:31.662
And he says, "You're it."

20:31.664 --> 20:35.333
<i>And he signals for</i>
<i>the big guys to go</i>
<i>into the next room.</i>

20:35.335 --> 20:37.568
<i>And he says,</i>
<i>"Aren't you the</i>
<i>lucky bitch?</i>

20:39.738 --> 20:43.941
You're the only girl
in the world tonight
that gets to touch it."

20:46.545 --> 20:50.748
<i>And he looks down
at himself and says,</i>

20:50.750 --> 20:54.418
"The envy of all mankind."

21:03.028 --> 21:06.330
Well, he did
what he did.

21:08.900 --> 21:13.738
And the big guys worked
me over real good
on the service stairs.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.307
And some hotel people,
they dumped me at Emergency.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.757
Isn't $100 what you charge
for the first hour?

21:34.526 --> 21:37.662
Today's my day
for turnin' down money.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.024
What'd you wanna
pay me for?

21:40.732 --> 21:42.667
'Cause I wanna sue
his ass, Nicky.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.969
You must hire
a lawyer, Holly.
I'm not a lawyer.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.071
I don't even know his name
or what room he was in

21:47.073 --> 21:49.907
or any god damn thing
about him.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.510
Then you must hire
a detective, Holly.
I'm not a detective.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.011
I don't know any god damn
detectives, Nick.

21:54.013 --> 21:57.648
I know you,
and you know everybody.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.418
I mean, how could
you not help me?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.720
'Cause I'm gonna guess
the three gentlemen
you talked about

22:02.722 --> 22:05.022
were not IBM executives.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.091
What hotel were you in?

22:08.727 --> 22:11.095
The Golden Nugget.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.431
Better and better.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.066
A lot of people like it.

22:15.068 --> 22:18.402
True, and so is this...

22:18.404 --> 22:20.338
every high school
student knows

22:20.340 --> 22:21.972
there's no such thing
as organized crime
in America.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.442
<i>Every elementary school
student knows</i>

22:24.444 --> 22:26.844
<i>that if organized crime
ever dreamt of invading,</i>

22:26.846 --> 22:30.047
the last city they would
come to would be Vegas.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.749
And every kindergarten
student knows

22:31.751 --> 22:33.751
that if the mob ever
did to town,

22:33.753 --> 22:37.121
the last hotel to be tainted
would be the Golden Nugget.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.624
Shit, Holly, I mean,
even their fucking showgirls

22:40.626 --> 22:41.959
can rip the phonebook in half.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.862
Remember when I told you
not to go to that place?

22:47.933 --> 22:51.453
You know what?
You could always
piss me off, Holly.

22:52.471 --> 22:55.606
<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

22:55.608 --> 22:57.889
But I want us to be clear.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.913
Holly, when I came
to this town,

23:02.915 --> 23:05.149
you was just a kid
who lived across
the street.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.619
That first year, Baby
himself tried to recruit me
for his organization.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.522
I said no.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.758
If someone got bloody,
I wanted it to be
for my reasons,

23:13.760 --> 23:14.992
not anybody else's.

23:16.161 --> 23:18.129
Baby accepted that.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.930
Since then I've stayed
away from them

23:19.932 --> 23:21.732
and they stayed
away from me.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.871
I don't know a soul that
works at the Golden Nugget.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.875
I don't have
one contact there.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.478
I swear to God.

24:14.486 --> 24:17.521
Hey, Millicent.

24:17.523 --> 24:20.491
I don't think they
much appreciate us
having visitors.

24:20.493 --> 24:24.128
Hey, listen,
I'm interested in a guy
who looks like a fighter.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.831
<i>Has a suite, I guess
on a high floor,</i>

24:26.833 --> 24:28.566
travels with two
large bodyguards.

24:28.568 --> 24:31.235
You still live in Naked City?

24:31.237 --> 24:33.971
- You know Big Daddy's?
- Of course.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.773
I get off at four.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.576
You come down there
at about 4:15.

24:38.578 --> 24:41.846
<i>If I ain't there,
I couldn't find nothin'.</i>

24:41.848 --> 24:44.682
<i>If I am, we'll talk.</i>

24:46.918 --> 24:50.254
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, Millicent.

24:50.256 --> 24:53.624
Too bad you got all that
British blood in you.

24:53.626 --> 24:57.862
If you was black,
I'd bed you good and fast.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.730
You could make believe.

24:59.732 --> 25:03.000
Nah. Don't think this
is racial or anything,

25:03.002 --> 25:06.136
but I never feel like
you people are clean.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.939
This is a housekeeper
you're talking to, remember?

25:08.941 --> 25:13.277
I can tell if a Brit's been
in a room, just like that.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.613
Why should I think that
was racial or anything?

25:15.615 --> 25:18.015
Glad you don't.

25:18.017 --> 25:22.086
Now, this fighter guy,
his name is Danny DeMarco,

25:22.088 --> 25:24.154
suite 3506.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.191
He's from a fine old
Italian family back east.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.894
He's a son and heir
and his daddy loves him

25:29.896 --> 25:33.531
which is why he never
goes no place without
them two big mothers.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.533
How big are they?

25:35.535 --> 25:36.767
A lot bigger than you.

25:39.938 --> 25:41.772
You did me something once.

25:41.774 --> 25:45.776
I will owe you forever.

25:45.778 --> 25:48.913
But now, I need you
to do me something.

25:52.017 --> 25:56.754
Do not fuck with these guys.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.794
Pickle.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.801
Lady in the housekeeping,
I just met with her.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.671
She struck out, Holly.
Couldn't find out a thing.

26:13.673 --> 26:17.074
Oh, Nick.
Don't lie anymore.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.615
<i>You know what he did
when he was finished?</i>

26:25.650 --> 26:26.930
He put a gun inside me.

26:28.920 --> 26:33.357
<i>He said, "You got
one shot at breathing.</i>

26:33.359 --> 26:37.399
<i>Tell me you love</i>
<i>me,</i>
<i>and if I believe you,</i>
<i>I'll let you go."</i>

26:39.097 --> 26:42.700
I said, "Oh, God, I love you.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.970
I love you so much,
I do."

26:45.972 --> 26:50.007
And he said,
"Never shit a shitter."

26:50.009 --> 26:52.329
And then he pulled the trigger.

26:53.845 --> 26:55.379
And I scream

26:55.381 --> 26:58.215
<i>and I hear a click.</i>

27:00.652 --> 27:04.412
Some fucking games
to play with another
human. Right, Nicky?

27:07.626 --> 27:11.095
And I want to sue him,

27:11.097 --> 27:13.964
<i>and you know who he is,</i>

27:13.966 --> 27:15.733
and you just let him
walk away.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.368
<i>Just know I tried, Holly.</i>

27:17.370 --> 27:23.340
Sure, you liar.
Just know this one thing.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.243
All those times I told you
I cared for you...

27:26.245 --> 27:27.878
Yeah, I know, I know.
You were lying.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.882
Wrong. I loved you.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.885
Every good thing
I ever said was true.

27:34.887 --> 27:38.656
And when you hit bottom,
who climbed down there
and found you?

27:38.658 --> 27:41.358
- Only me.
- <i> Holly...</i>

28:19.197 --> 28:22.066
Hey!

28:22.068 --> 28:25.348
Sorry,
made a wrong turn
back that way.

28:27.939 --> 28:29.907
I am ready to see the sights.

28:29.909 --> 28:32.209
Follow me,
Mr. Kinnick.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.801
I hadn't realized these
places were so big.

29:30.803 --> 29:33.170
Yeah, the noise
bothers people sometimes.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.405
I don't mind the noise.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.107
Golden Gate is much smaller.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.176
It's just a short drive
down the block.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.512
By all means.

29:54.359 --> 29:56.960
This isn't as nice
as some of those
other places.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.996
Eh, tourist traps.

30:00.899 --> 30:02.566
How did you get into
this line of work?

30:02.568 --> 30:04.034
Special forces,
am I right?

30:04.036 --> 30:06.804
Trained to run around
all commando.

30:06.806 --> 30:11.441
What were you?
SBS? SRR? SAS?

30:11.443 --> 30:13.877
- Just "S".
- Just "S".

30:13.879 --> 30:15.913
- "S" for special?
- "S" for shut your mouth.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.081
It's not something
I'm getting into with you.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.317
I can take care of things.
That's all you need to know.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.020
That, and running around
"all commando"

30:23.022 --> 30:24.588
isn't a preferred military term.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.990
Are you always so touchy?

30:30.962 --> 30:32.496
Oh, hi, excuse me.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.531
Can I get a Fiji water, please?

30:34.533 --> 30:37.601
You knock the bottles over,
they don't roll away.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.204
- Nicky?
- Vodka double.

30:40.206 --> 30:43.240
In a square glass
so it doesn't roll away.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.475
Mm.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.245
Well, I am going to hit
the craps table.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.314
The hundred dollar
tables are back there.

30:50.316 --> 30:51.982
Yeah, but I can make
a greater number

30:51.984 --> 30:54.484
of smaller bets
at the $10 tables.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.353
Sounds like a winning system.

30:56.355 --> 31:00.090
- I got your back.
- Great.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.625
I'd like to bet $10
on the shooter, please.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.093
<i>Ten on the shooter, yes sir.</i>

31:03.095 --> 31:05.229
Hey, Nick.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.097
I've seen you happier.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.166
How wrong you are,
Cassandra.

31:09.168 --> 31:12.102
This is the highlight
of my career.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.571
- I'm protecting
a Fiji drinker.
- Here we go!

31:14.573 --> 31:17.241
<i>Big bet's $10</i>
<i>on a single roll</i>
<i>of the dice.</i>

31:17.243 --> 31:20.077
What you see on
my face is ecstasy.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.514
My shift's starting.

31:24.516 --> 31:27.985
Yellow 11, that's it.
Yellow 11 is the
on line winner.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.319
Winner's rolling hot.

31:39.297 --> 31:42.266
<i>You know who he is</i>

31:42.268 --> 31:44.501
<i>and you just
let him walk away.</i>

31:51.142 --> 31:53.143
We're quits, okay?

31:53.145 --> 31:54.444
But I intend
on gambling for hours.

31:54.446 --> 31:57.014
I don't have hours.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.448
And you're safe in
the casino, Kinnick.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.350
Nobody'll mug you in the casino.

32:00.352 --> 32:03.587
And outside they've got these
yellow things called taxis.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.189
Just grab one and you'll
be back at Caesars

32:06.191 --> 32:08.025
in half a minute.
Home and dry.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.426
Goodbye, Kinnick.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.677
His name's Danny DeMarco.
He's staying at the
Golden Nugget.

32:26.679 --> 32:29.112
Suite 3506.

32:29.114 --> 32:32.249
- Good night, Holly.
- Wait.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.218
- What?
- At least let me
write it down.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.322
Then write it down.

32:38.324 --> 32:41.058
- <i> You know how to spell it?</i>
- No.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.592
- What'd you say?
- <i> That's what I said.</i>

32:42.594 --> 32:45.329
Good luck with your
fucking lawsuit, okay?

32:45.331 --> 32:47.397
What are you so angry about?

32:47.399 --> 32:49.566
- Liar!
- I'm not.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.402
You never once intended
suing the son of a bitch,
did you, sweetness?

32:52.404 --> 32:55.072
<i>You'll see.</i>

32:55.074 --> 32:57.207
I won't help you anymore.
I don't help liars.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.276
- Quit calling me that.
- Quit doing it, then.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.244
Would you help me?

33:01.246 --> 33:03.480
- What kind of help
could I give you?
- You know.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.349
Yeah, I'd get killed.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.584
- There's only three of them.
- Three of them with guns.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.120
You gotta go in there
and you gotta soften them up
so I can have my chance!

33:10.122 --> 33:13.190
- Chance for what, Holly?
- I want his nuts in my hands!

33:15.393 --> 33:17.160
And if they kill me?

33:18.629 --> 33:20.330
I'll be miserable for days.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.736
I want him so bad
for what he did to me.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.038
I want my revenge, Nicky.

34:16.687 --> 34:18.688
Yeah?

34:18.690 --> 34:22.559
I'm here to see
Mr. DeMarco.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.161
About?

34:25.164 --> 34:26.663
It's personal.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.565
Well, he's busy.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.168
I don't think Baby
is gonna be too happy
with me stuck out here.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.137
I don't give a shit.

34:38.275 --> 34:40.077
- Who was it?
- It was some guy.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.239
Said he was a friend of Baby's.

34:43.481 --> 34:44.547
Shit.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.692
So you're a friend of Baby's?

34:51.456 --> 34:54.291
- What's this about?
- A girl.

34:57.195 --> 34:59.396
<i>You two get the fuck out.</i>

35:05.404 --> 35:07.404
Hey, you kidding me?

35:12.243 --> 35:15.712
- You searched him?
- Mm-hmm. Yup.

35:20.751 --> 35:24.354
Sorry about that, Santy Claus.
Can't be too careful these days.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.490
We should have a drink.
Any friend of Baby's...

35:26.492 --> 35:28.758
It's good of you
to see me like this,
Mr. DeMarco.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.261
Danny. Call me Danny.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.763
- What do I call you?
- Nick.

35:33.765 --> 35:38.435
We'll, Nick, I'm told there's
something about a girl?

35:38.437 --> 35:40.904
- Where is she?
- In my sled on the roof.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.875
Oh, is she pretty?

35:44.877 --> 35:48.245
- Was.
- Come again?

35:48.247 --> 35:52.382
Last night a friend of mine
was shown some disrespect
and I thought, you know,

35:52.384 --> 35:54.584
maybe you might do something
to make things okay.

35:54.586 --> 35:57.487
Oh, that.

35:57.489 --> 36:02.425
We'll you see, Nick,
that wasn't disrespect.

36:02.427 --> 36:05.595
That was a game.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.364
We were having ourselves
a little party.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.267
And what happened after
wasn't so nice either.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.802
<i>She had to be stitched up
in Emergency.</i>

36:12.804 --> 36:14.204
Oh.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.544
Could he be talking about us?

36:20.546 --> 36:22.946
- No, that's not us.
- No, not us, boss.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.182
They're lying, Nick.

36:25.184 --> 36:27.417
I know this is
probably another game
you're playing,

36:27.419 --> 36:29.539
only this time it's with me.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.623
You can't show
disrespect to a whore

36:33.625 --> 36:35.825
and that's what your friend is.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.495
- No, she's...
- It's best not to
interrupt me, Nick.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.198
Yes, sir.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.433
She's a whore,
you're her pimp.

36:43.435 --> 36:46.795
At least you look like
a two-bit pimp to me.
Am I right?

36:47.438 --> 36:50.307
No, I'm legit,
Mr. DeMarco.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.275
Look, see.

36:52.277 --> 36:56.279
Credit cards,
driver's license,
they're all mine.

36:58.849 --> 37:02.485
Well, Nick,
what the hell.

37:02.487 --> 37:05.822
Maybe you have a point.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.959
Would $50,000 cover
your disrespect, Nick?

37:08.961 --> 37:10.694
You're very generous.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.830
And you're very stupid.

37:15.866 --> 37:18.268
But even so, you probably
know what this is.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.337
And where it's been.

37:20.339 --> 37:22.872
- Let me just leave.
- Oh, you're gonna
leave, Nick.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.841
The question is what shape
you're gonna be in

37:24.843 --> 37:26.610
- when you do so.
- Listen, I...

37:26.612 --> 37:28.445
Didn't I tell you something
about interrupting me,

37:28.447 --> 37:30.547
you dumb fuck?

37:35.553 --> 37:37.487
Yes, sir.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.356
You remember what?

37:39.358 --> 37:42.292
- You said it was
best not to.
- Right.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.596
You see, if I'm sweet
to you, Nick,

37:46.598 --> 37:48.965
if I just let you
walk out of here
free as air,

37:48.967 --> 37:51.935
<i>well, I want people
to know how sweet I am.</i>

37:51.937 --> 37:54.371
<i>So, be honest, Nick.</i>

37:54.373 --> 37:56.539
Tell me about my good qualities,

37:56.541 --> 37:59.021
and if I believe you,
you're free as air.

38:05.916 --> 38:08.351
You're a great man,
Mr. DeMarco.

38:08.353 --> 38:10.920
A peach of a guy.
You're the best.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.890
A genuine top of
the line human being.

38:16.027 --> 38:21.431
You failed so far, Nick,
but I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

38:21.433 --> 38:24.000
So go ahead,
talk about me.

38:43.554 --> 38:45.874
The fuck are you
thinking about, huh?

38:48.959 --> 38:52.462
Corsica.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.864
- But it went away.
- Tiel, Kinlaw,

38:54.866 --> 38:56.733
take this dumb fuck
out of my sight.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.669
Why don't you show him
how sweet I really am?

39:02.440 --> 39:03.940
Let's go.

39:31.435 --> 39:32.569
Stop him!

40:11.776 --> 40:13.143
That's him.

40:13.145 --> 40:14.677
Better be,

40:14.679 --> 40:17.119
or he's got one
hell of a lawsuit.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.992
You softened them up
pretty good.

40:25.556 --> 40:27.157
Remember me?

40:31.862 --> 40:33.963
<i>Sure, you're the party girl</i>

40:33.965 --> 40:37.967
- we had all those
nice games with.
- Right.

40:37.969 --> 40:42.439
I had so much fun,
I can't stand that
that party is over.

40:42.441 --> 40:44.841
I wanted it to go on forever.

40:45.643 --> 40:47.644
Hey, what's she up to, huh?

40:54.552 --> 40:59.622
- The envy of all mankind.
- Yeah.

40:59.624 --> 41:04.060
- Do you know who I am?
- Of course.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.200
You're the party giver.

41:11.635 --> 41:15.238
What the fuck
is she doing, huh?

41:15.240 --> 41:18.708
<i>What is this about? Money?
Is that what this is?</i>

41:18.710 --> 41:21.544
Sure it is. You know what,
just take the 50, huh?

41:21.546 --> 41:23.847
- <i> Take it for chrissakes.</i>
- What money?

41:23.849 --> 41:25.748
$50,000.
Top desk drawer.

41:27.852 --> 41:29.152
Yeah, there you go.

41:34.492 --> 41:38.027
- Yeah, see?
- This isn't about money.

41:40.130 --> 41:43.600
- This is about love.
- Is it?

41:43.602 --> 41:45.869
Hey, I didn't do nothin'.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.537
It was all Tiel and Kinlaw.

41:47.539 --> 41:48.771
It was them. Why don't
you tell your girl

41:48.773 --> 41:49.973
to put those away?

41:49.975 --> 41:52.335
I hope I sharpened
these enough.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.746
- Let's see.
- Hey...

41:56.748 --> 41:59.282
Hey, wait...
Wait! Hey...

41:59.284 --> 42:02.552
Guess they're sharp enough.

42:02.554 --> 42:06.689
Look, there's a little
tiny cut right on the
envy of all mankind.

42:09.961 --> 42:12.095
Let me... just let me be!
Let me be, please!

42:12.097 --> 42:14.831
I... you got the wrong idea!
I'm really a good guy!

42:14.833 --> 42:16.766
- I am!
- So you're not mad
at me, then?

42:16.768 --> 42:19.202
No! No!

42:21.138 --> 42:25.909
Good, I'm not mad
at you, either.

42:25.911 --> 42:29.551
I'm gonna give
you the same break
that you gave me.

42:32.816 --> 42:34.717
Tell me you love me,

42:34.719 --> 42:38.254
and if I believe it,
then I'll let you keep it.

42:38.256 --> 42:41.991
But if I don't believe you,
that means you're a bad boy.

42:41.993 --> 42:45.595
And bad boys need
to be punished.

42:45.597 --> 42:49.232
So that the envy
of all mankind

42:49.234 --> 42:53.636
will have to
go away with me.

42:58.175 --> 43:01.344
I... love you.

43:01.346 --> 43:04.247
- What'd you say?
- I love you.

43:04.249 --> 43:07.784
I don't think that
sounded very sincere.

43:07.786 --> 43:10.753
- Did it?
- This is your show.

43:10.755 --> 43:15.224
Don't! Don't do this,
don't! Don't!

43:15.226 --> 43:16.826
Last chance.

43:17.995 --> 43:19.596
I fucking love you!

43:19.598 --> 43:20.863
I just...
I just love...

43:20.865 --> 43:22.198
I love you!
I love you!

43:22.200 --> 43:23.967
Please, please don't...
look, okay.

43:23.969 --> 43:26.035
I made a little mistake.
I made a little mistake!

43:26.037 --> 43:28.237
Everyone can make
a little mistake, okay?

43:28.239 --> 43:29.272
Just don't!

43:29.274 --> 43:31.107
No, no, no,
please don't!

43:31.109 --> 43:33.876
Don't! Don't!
I'm sorry!

43:39.650 --> 43:41.050
Don't!

44:00.704 --> 44:04.140
- Wish I brought my camera.
- Okay. Okay.

44:08.712 --> 44:09.912
<i>You have to
leave town, Holly.</i>

44:09.914 --> 44:12.115
<i>They're coming for me, too.</i>

44:12.117 --> 44:14.384
First, I'm gonna win
enough cash to get out
of this place for good.

44:14.386 --> 44:17.954
Yeah, I know. I spent
the last hours packing,
without regret I might add,

44:17.956 --> 44:20.089
- because I'm heading
straight for...
- Hey, don't tell me.

44:20.091 --> 44:21.958
If I don't know,
I can't tell anybody.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.760
You that sure
they'll come after you?

44:23.762 --> 44:25.428
- You know damn well they will.
- You could've killed them.

44:25.430 --> 44:27.263
I try not to do that.

44:32.102 --> 44:33.403
No, you keep it all.

44:33.405 --> 44:35.205
You're the one
that took the risk.

44:40.711 --> 44:43.946
Okay, I want half.

44:43.948 --> 44:45.828
I'm the one that
took the beating.

45:44.508 --> 45:48.044
Well, you only look
about a million times
better than before.

45:48.046 --> 45:50.079
A friend of mine left town.

45:50.081 --> 45:52.515
We had this kind of
going away thing.

45:52.517 --> 45:54.150
Sounds sweet.

45:54.152 --> 45:55.852
How much longer
you on this shift?

45:55.854 --> 45:58.121
11:50. Ten minutes.

45:58.123 --> 46:00.523
What the hell,
I shall keep you company.

46:00.525 --> 46:03.326
Well, I've been killin'
everyone tonight, Nicky.

46:03.328 --> 46:07.163
You did something for me once.
So believe this, bet small.

46:08.932 --> 46:10.767
Changing 100.

46:10.769 --> 46:14.270
Since it's a $5 minimum,
how's if I bet five dollars?

46:22.813 --> 46:24.814
Bust.

46:24.816 --> 46:26.048
It's been like that.

46:31.555 --> 46:32.955
Blackjack.

46:32.957 --> 46:35.277
I lose more friends this way.

46:50.474 --> 46:52.975
What is it?

46:52.977 --> 46:55.178
Cass, I've got 19.

46:55.180 --> 47:00.249
And you've a 10 showing,
except I know somethin'.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.351
Your down card
is another picture

47:02.353 --> 47:06.856
which makes 20,
so my 19 is shit.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.457
You want me
to hit 19, Nicky?

47:08.459 --> 47:11.360
I'll tell you why.

47:11.362 --> 47:13.429
Because there's a weight
on my shoulder now.

47:13.431 --> 47:17.433
Locks right into
my shoulder now.
It's happened.

47:17.435 --> 47:19.502
I've got to go
for the throat, Cass.

47:19.504 --> 47:23.105
Because of all the people
in all the casinos
in all the world,

47:23.107 --> 47:26.175
luck's come camping with me.

47:26.177 --> 47:29.612
So, yes, I want you
to hit my 19.

47:32.015 --> 47:35.384
<i>And I'd like a two.
Two is 21.</i>

47:35.386 --> 47:37.486
Means I win.

47:39.456 --> 47:42.058
My two please, Cass.

47:50.067 --> 47:52.902
Jesus.

47:52.904 --> 47:57.006
I'd like a $1,000 dollar
chip please, Cass.

47:57.008 --> 47:59.508
One way or another,
this is my last
night in Vegas.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.645
Changing 1,000.

48:39.383 --> 48:40.683
Take care, Nicky.

48:44.154 --> 48:47.089
- You playing?
- No.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.258
You got mean eyes.

49:19.523 --> 49:21.023
Up or down?

49:25.295 --> 49:27.063
I had luck riding with me,

49:28.565 --> 49:30.445
then they changed dealers.

49:39.676 --> 49:40.977
Asshole!

49:42.679 --> 49:45.281
Not you, me.

49:45.283 --> 49:46.523
How do I know it's gone?

49:51.521 --> 49:52.722
Blackjack.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.018
Give me a chip rack, please.

50:08.505 --> 50:10.006
Can I raise the limit?

50:10.008 --> 50:11.474
No.

50:11.476 --> 50:13.876
I'll play the
whole table then.

50:39.470 --> 50:43.639
Nah, I'm not greedy.

50:45.675 --> 50:48.115
You gotta win some time.

50:56.219 --> 50:59.288
- Blackjack.
- What the fuck is this?

50:59.290 --> 51:01.323
Retribution for 5,000 mornings.

51:01.325 --> 51:03.659
And watch your mouth
in front of a lady.

51:03.661 --> 51:06.062
Thanks, sweetie.

51:19.444 --> 51:22.278
God, what a thing when
luck comes callin', huh?

51:23.514 --> 51:25.848
Good.

51:28.519 --> 51:31.087
Yes!

51:36.360 --> 51:39.495
Son of a god damn bitch.

51:54.744 --> 51:56.579
Good.

51:59.583 --> 52:01.817
<i>If I win...</i>

52:01.819 --> 52:03.819
I'm over 500.

52:05.555 --> 52:07.723
<i>And that'll be the last
you ever hear of me.</i>

52:33.817 --> 52:35.818
Yes! What the hell!

52:35.820 --> 52:37.820
Yes!

52:37.822 --> 52:41.690
500 and...
6 thousand.

52:44.227 --> 52:45.561
It isn't exactly
a round number,

52:45.563 --> 52:48.664
but then I was never
one to quibble.

52:57.507 --> 52:59.875
- Fiji?
- Vodka.

52:59.877 --> 53:02.511
- Rocks with a twist?
- Look at that.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.313
Doubles,
please, Veronica.

53:04.315 --> 53:06.182
Thank you, Veronica.

53:07.517 --> 53:09.285
So what do your
friends call you?

53:09.287 --> 53:11.687
Cyrus is a
pretty shitty name.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.556
I always wanted to
be called Ace or Duke.

53:13.558 --> 53:16.258
But Cyrus seems like
the overwhelming choice.

53:17.827 --> 53:19.862
How are you not
more excited?

53:19.864 --> 53:22.631
Never hit over
half a mil before.

53:22.633 --> 53:25.367
I don't know why
I'm not more excited.

53:25.369 --> 53:28.470
Maybe it's because
I never dared
think it would happen.

53:28.472 --> 53:31.307
That make sense?

53:31.309 --> 53:32.808
Kinda.

53:32.810 --> 53:35.311
- Anything else?
- That's all, thanks, hon.

53:35.313 --> 53:38.614
Here, love,
take some time off.
Go see your mom.

53:38.616 --> 53:44.220
Thank you so much, Nick.

53:44.222 --> 53:46.422
- Well, cheers.
- Hey, cheers.

53:49.726 --> 53:52.494
- You're leaving town?
- Think bigger.

53:52.496 --> 53:53.729
State, country, continent.

53:56.466 --> 53:58.400
Five free years, Duke.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.369
I've been dreamin'
this since forever.

54:00.371 --> 54:04.873
$100,000 per.
I've got it figured
to the penny.

54:06.743 --> 54:08.577
Guess you haven't
liked Vegas much, huh?

54:08.579 --> 54:10.879
You're not supposed
to like Vegas.

54:10.881 --> 54:15.751
It's just this creeping virus
people catch sometimes.

54:18.521 --> 54:20.022
Sweet dreams.

54:20.024 --> 54:22.258
I'm off to Corsica
in the morning.

54:22.260 --> 54:24.893
I'm gonna sail
the Mediterranean
before I die.

54:24.895 --> 54:26.795
Well, I'll walk you out.

54:26.797 --> 54:28.864
That's very kind of you, Duke.

55:32.562 --> 55:34.463
Fuck.

55:34.465 --> 55:37.333
- What's happened?

55:37.335 --> 55:40.069
It was all horseshit.

55:40.071 --> 55:43.939
It's just a loser's dream.

55:45.675 --> 55:46.975
I don't get you.

55:46.977 --> 55:50.045
This is not what I need.

55:50.047 --> 55:53.582
Five years would only
be fine at first.

55:53.584 --> 55:55.884
After that I'd just
realize that every day

55:55.886 --> 55:59.488
was another day closer
to bein' back here.

55:59.490 --> 56:02.825
I never pushed the logic,
because I never thought
I'd be in this position.

56:02.827 --> 56:05.994
Half a million.

56:05.996 --> 56:09.898
Well, half a million's nothing.

56:09.900 --> 56:12.340
I know now what
I really need.

56:13.837 --> 56:17.005
- What's that?
- "Fuck you" money.

56:20.143 --> 56:22.745
Enough so I'll never
have to come back here.

56:24.781 --> 56:28.884
Freedom. That's what
"fuck you" money is.

56:44.534 --> 56:46.402
I don't want any limit.

56:46.404 --> 56:47.770
I have to clear that.

56:50.807 --> 56:52.174
Let me check.

56:56.546 --> 56:59.114
He thinks I'm gonna lose.

56:59.116 --> 57:00.916
You've got it.

57:00.918 --> 57:02.050
Asshole.

57:03.987 --> 57:06.054
It's 500.

57:06.056 --> 57:07.089
You count it.

57:12.962 --> 57:16.198
- 500,000 going out.
- Send it.

57:23.706 --> 57:26.675
That's 525,000.

57:28.144 --> 57:30.979
This fella's gettin'
awful heavy.

57:30.981 --> 57:32.681
All on one, Cass.

57:51.501 --> 57:53.869
<i>It's just like
we started, Cass.</i>

57:55.839 --> 57:59.808
I know you've got
another picture
under there.

58:06.783 --> 58:07.883
Hit me.

58:10.220 --> 58:13.155
A four.

58:13.157 --> 58:14.790
If you don't mind.

59:01.037 --> 59:03.639
You should've stood, Nicky.

59:04.707 --> 59:05.874
You would've won.

59:14.919 --> 59:19.655
I came in with $25,000.
Lost $25,000.

59:22.659 --> 59:24.192
No big deal.

59:54.157 --> 59:58.860
You fuckin' had it.

59:58.862 --> 01:00:00.228
You fuckin' had it!

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:02.264
<i>It was right there.</i>

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:03.932
<i>You fuckin' had it!</i>

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.901
<i>You fuckin' had it.</i>

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:18.280
It was all there.
It was all there.

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:20.949
<i>On the fucking table.</i>

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:23.652
<i>You fuckin' had it!</i>

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:25.287
On the fucking table!

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.663
<i>You fuckin' had it.</i>

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:35.998
You fuckin' had it!

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.175
Would you like your
grapefruit juice now?

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:28.216
How did I get here?

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:30.118
After you passed out,
I tipped some of the staff

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.753
to help me bring you.

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.427
Thank you.

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.734
Hmm, I thought you'd be thirsty.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:50.138
<i>Listen, Duke,
you're a great caterer,</i>

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.707
<i>and I appreciate it.</i>

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:53.475
But I think you
got somethin' to say

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:57.145
- and it's time you said it.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:58.213
You won't laugh?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.115
Not today.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.956
All right, I...

01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:10.158
I lied about my friend
recommending you.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.394
<i>And I didn't have to ask
for your qualifications.</i>

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:15.197
I knew everything about you,
I've researched you.

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:17.265
I knew about the
grapefruit juice, right?

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:19.501
<i>And the double vodka.</i>

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:21.503
<i>And I know about why
you always sit</i>

01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:23.505
in the same spot
at the Silver Spoon Counter.

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:30.212
I need something from you
and I've come too far
for a no answer.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:40.188
A while back in Boston I saw
this old guy on the street

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.390
and he had a sign
on his back that said,

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:44.192
"Please don't hit me."

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:49.364
<i>And my first thought was,
"What a sad thing."</i>

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:51.299
<i>But then...</i>

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:54.436
I got so fucking mad

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:57.305
because I realized
that was going to be
me when I got old.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:01.209
<i>Just an old nut
scared of the world.</i>

01:03:01.211 --> 01:03:04.546
And so I've come to you.

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:06.414
I want you to teach me.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:12.554
- Teach you what?
- Anything. Everything.

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:16.324
I need you to kill
the fear that lives
inside of me every day.

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:17.793
You want to sail
the Mediterranean,

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:20.295
I want to do something
brave before I die.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.034
Hey, listen, kid...

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:31.339
I earned 70 million dollars
by the time I was 19.

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:34.409
Don't call me kid.

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:41.249
Jesus. How?

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.851
It was nothing.

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:45.554
I put a new twist
on an old twist

01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:48.290
on computer software.

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:51.393
Being smart is the only
defense I've ever had,

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:54.863
but it's not enough anymore.

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:57.966
You've got to help me.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.103
You know how fuckin'
weird this is?

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:06.274
<i>You're not even 30,
set for life.</i>

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.610
I'm pushing 40, broke.

01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:10.378
I'll pay you.
I'll make you rich.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.381
I have been rich.
Most recently last night.

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:16.084
Yeah, I could help you
with that, too.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.222
Help me with what?

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:24.025
Are you serious?

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.529
I like blackjack
maybe more than I should.

01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:31.032
- That's all.
- Why do you think
you stay here?

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:34.135
You hate it so much
it's the only place
you can stay.

01:04:34.137 --> 01:04:35.577
It's the only place
you're worthy of.

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:38.607
It's all so obvious.

01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:40.275
Well, if it's all
so fuckin' obvious,

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:42.143
why are you so fuckin' wrong?

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:43.979
Huh?

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.415
Don't go!
We can help each other!

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:50.118
You know what?
You're just like the
nuts who write to me.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.088
You want adventure? Swell!

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:56.224
Well I earned my past, Cyrus.
Go earn your own.

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:25.954
This one's on me, Nick.
Looks like you need it.

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.064
Nick Wild,
how you doin'?

01:05:36.066 --> 01:05:38.667
You need to come with us.
Mr. DeMarco's waiting.

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.868
Take five.

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.810
Nicholas. Nicholas.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:12.279
Baby.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:15.683
I heard you were up over 500
last night at the Gate.

01:09:15.685 --> 01:09:16.917
Talk of the town.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.853
Do you remember,
when was it?

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:20.354
A couple months ago
when you had us beaten
for 200 grand?

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.457
Right here at the Nugget?

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:25.660
- Till your luck changed.
- I'll get there some day.

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:31.366
Nicholas.

01:09:31.368 --> 01:09:35.502
I'm just in a terrible bind
and it's all because of you.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.939
It seems that
somebody broke into
room 3506 last night,

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:43.310
beat up on three guys
and took $50,000.

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:45.594
And that was before
I had my Wheaties.

01:09:47.384 --> 01:09:48.950
If only that were funny.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:53.321
No, it seems that
this same somebody

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:57.192
shot and killed two gentlemen
names Kinlaw and Tiel.

01:09:57.194 --> 01:10:00.929
Shot them while they
were tied and helpless.

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:05.400
And an eyewitness claims
that that someone was you.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:08.443
And you believe that?

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.472
If I did, you'd be dead.

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:17.412
- Come along, Nicholas.
- Come along where?

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:20.615
To see DeMarco.
I have to find
the truth.

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:23.351
Wait a minute,
you mean I'm on trial?

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:25.153
For your life,
I should imagine.

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.269
<i>Why do I have
to tell it again?</i>

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:18.606
<i>I told you.
You believe me. So why?</i>

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:22.577
Because, Daniel,
you are asking me
to kill Nicholas here.

01:11:22.579 --> 01:11:24.545
And if a mistake
was later discovered,

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:26.681
I would feel simply dreadful.

01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:29.751
So please, be as brief
as you will.

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:34.722
I feel guilty
because I let him in.

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:36.758
<i>When the knock came
on the door, I...</i>

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.695
<i>I wasn't thinking
and I opened it.</i>

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:42.930
And right away
he pistol whips me,

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:44.432
right in the mouth,
you see? Right there.

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:45.800
- Mm-hmm. Yes.
- <i> Right there.</i>

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.435
- Yeah.
- <i> And he's quick.</i>

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:50.405
He takes out Tiel and Kinlaw
like they were nothing.

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:51.773
And he ties them up
back to back

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.441
the way they were
when you found 'em.

01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:59.314
And then he rifles my desk,
he takes the 50 and...

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:03.685
for no fucking reason
he goes crazy

01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:07.555
<i>and he shoots maybe</i>
<i>my two best friends</i>
<i>in the whole world.</i>

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:11.392
Why?

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:17.965
Probably he's pissed
that there wasn't
more cash.

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:19.967
<i>And probably he
would've killed me, too,</i>

01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:21.969
but there was a noise
out in the hall

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:24.339
and he panicked and he ran.

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:27.909
Shot 'em with their
own guns, Baby.

01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:30.845
Can you believe that?

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.847
You check.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.849
You'll see that
I'm telling the truth.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:37.385
They're gonna have
his fingerprints
all over 'em.

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:38.920
Don't bother checkin'.

01:12:38.922 --> 01:12:42.890
- The fingerprints are mine.
- This is all true then?

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:44.959
- Some.
- Which?

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:49.630
You better speak, Nicholas.

01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:52.033
And I suggest you
begin right now.

01:12:54.503 --> 01:12:56.637
I'll ask just two
questions, Baby.

01:12:56.639 --> 01:12:58.506
If you're gonna answer them
to your satisfaction,

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:01.376
do what you will.

01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:03.144
First, why would I use a gun?

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.580
The fuck kind of
question is that?

01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:08.149
Why does anybody use a gun?

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:10.785
Nicholas never does.

01:13:10.787 --> 01:13:13.388
Believe me,
he could kill you with...

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:15.523
he could kill you with this

01:13:15.525 --> 01:13:17.792
<i>from five feet or 15.</i>

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:21.162
And the answer to your
question is this.

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:22.897
It's the perfect cover.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.533
<i>Nobody would ever dream
that Nick Wild needed a gun</i>

01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:28.736
to commit a robbery.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.072
All right, Nicholas.
Second question.

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:32.907
Second and last.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:39.013
Baby, what do you
know about my body?

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:43.117
- I mean, underneath my clothes?
- Obviously nothing.

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:45.186
<i>Well, then, there's
my second question.</i>

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:49.624
How is it possible
that I know that
Mr. DeMarco here

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:52.026
has a small but definite cut

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:54.095
on the upper side
of his Hampton?

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:57.999
<i>Answer?</i>

01:13:58.001 --> 01:14:00.134
<i>I saw it put there
by a dear sweet lady</i>

01:14:00.136 --> 01:14:02.837
with a pair
of garden shears.

01:14:02.839 --> 01:14:05.573
- What is this shit, huh?
- It's easy to find
out if I'm lying,

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:07.041
just have him take
down his trousers.

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:09.477
You're not buying this crap,
are you, Baby?

01:14:09.479 --> 01:14:10.812
Someone go get a microscope

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:13.080
so we locate
Mr. DeMarco's pecker.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:14.682
<i>- You know what?
- I'm not stripping.</i>

01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:16.451
I'm not stripping for nobody.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:17.985
I think you must, Daniel.

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:20.455
Nicholas is risking his life

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:23.825
on a very unusual
long shot here.

01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:25.126
<i>I know it's embarrassing,</i>

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.462
<i>but I'll make it
easier for you.</i>

01:14:27.464 --> 01:14:29.564
You and I will go
in the other room,

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:32.133
and we'll both
take down our pants.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:35.069
I won't. I won't.

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:37.605
- I'm afraid you must.
- It's...

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:39.874
- It's a matter
of principle, Baby. I...

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:41.776
<i>- Nobody would...
- Second cousin.</i>

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:44.545
- It's principle.
- Oh, dear.

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:47.615
It's principle! He...

01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:50.251
Would somebody shut
this god damn fucker up?

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:52.854
Oh, Daniel, you just
blew the ballgame.

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:55.790
Nobody in your family has had
even a passing relationship

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:58.192
with a principle
in the past 50 years.

01:14:58.194 --> 01:14:59.894
So you're siding with him?

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:02.497
Baby, you believe him over me?

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.267
I believe this.

01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:11.606
I believe that somebody
who looks like Nicholas

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:13.608
did the deed.

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:17.678
And I will endeavor to find him.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.680
Now you may go.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:25.786
You. I'm gonna see
you real soon.

01:15:25.788 --> 01:15:27.788
I'm gonna see you real soon.

01:15:29.659 --> 01:15:32.860
<i>You watch your fuckin' back!</i>

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:36.597
Why do you think he did it?

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:39.634
He's a very macho little slime.

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:42.476
And he broke down
and humiliated himself
in front of them.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.074
You know he'll come for you.

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:48.076
Yeah.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.949
If you don't care,
why'd you defend yourself?

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:57.218
I didn't wanna be remembered
for doin' what he said.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.188
Dyin' ain't so bad.

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:04.292
And at least I'll be
out of Las Vegas.

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:08.996
Thank you, Nicholas.
Good luck.

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:12.099
- Cheers, Baby.
- All right. Be well.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.644
Hey.

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:30.646
That bad, huh?

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:37.418
<i>Could you get the
check, please?</i>

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.338
I'm leaving.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:00.041
I'm only here to give you
a present of gratitude

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:02.677
of everything you taught me.

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:05.312
What, for chrissakes?

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:09.817
That everyone's afraid.

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:18.726
That I'm not the only
cowardly asshole
in this world.

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:20.127
You're one, too.

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:22.329
I really needed this now.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.401
What I have to deal
with is that

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:30.805
I'm the one
inside my own skin.

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:32.773
Maybe it's not so terrible.

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:34.108
And if you can admit
what you are,

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:36.343
you might find it's
not so terrible either.

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:50.991
Okay, Duke.
I admit it.

01:18:50.993 --> 01:18:52.960
<i>If I'd won the full million,</i>

01:18:52.962 --> 01:18:57.898
I would have figured out
some reason to go for more.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.134
I'm a trapped compulsive.

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:03.738
There. I said it.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.140
See me tap dancing?

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:11.212
No, but you might
have taken

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:13.013
the first tiny step
toward your sailboat.

01:19:13.015 --> 01:19:15.883
Yeah, doubtful.

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:19.386
Doubtful for two reasons,
the first being the
lack of funding.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:24.091
I knew you were
gonna say that.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:26.160
Reach under the counter.

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:27.928
I told you I bought
you a present.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:30.865
<i>I taped it there
before you got here.</i>

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:45.946
What's this?

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.349
One plane ticket to Corsica

01:19:48.351 --> 01:19:53.354
<i>and a check for $500,000.</i>

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:01.896
Okay, so, first reason's
taken care of.

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:03.964
Now what's the second?

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:08.435
I'm bein' murdered any minute.

01:20:08.437 --> 01:20:11.906
Murdered?

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:14.074
Really? When is
this happening?

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:22.116
Now.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.456
Oh.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.499
Put them away,
put them away.

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:16.136
I want him found now, today.

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:18.172
I want you to find that asshole.

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:19.874
I want you to find him.
I don't care how long

01:21:19.876 --> 01:21:22.042
it takes any of you dumb fucks.

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:23.944
<i>You call more fuckin' guys.</i>

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:26.413
<i>Get two on the bus station
and a few at the airport.</i>

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.016
<i>Check every bar,</i>
<i>every casino,</i>
<i>every whorehouse.</i>

01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:31.418
<i>Turn over every god damn rock
he could slither under.</i>

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.654
<i>You find out where he lives...</i>

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.024
<i>Where he works...</i>

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.561
<i>...how much it costs.</i>

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:43.297
<i>Go back inside there,
grab that fuckin' kid</i>

01:21:43.299 --> 01:21:45.432
<i>and kill that motherfucker, too!</i>

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:26.106
Get in there!
Get in there! Go!

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:44.651
You don't wanna go back there.

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:46.720
- <i> You lost them?</i>
- In a manner of speaking.

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:49.123
Hey, wait,
you forgot these.

01:23:49.125 --> 01:23:50.391
Take them.

01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:52.760
- Nah, nah.
- No, take them!

01:23:52.762 --> 01:23:55.662
Nick, please.
I can leave town now

01:23:55.664 --> 01:23:57.431
and know that I'm not a coward.

01:23:57.433 --> 01:24:00.134
And you have no idea what
a relief that is for me.

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:06.073
You earned this.

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:14.581
Thanks. And not
just for this.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:16.583
Not just for acting
like an idiot

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:20.087
so I could get
out of the diner.

01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:22.256
You're a good friend.

01:24:22.258 --> 01:24:24.391
We're friends?

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.193
Don't ruin it.

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:37.304
- <i> Good-bye, Duke.</i>
- Merry Christmas, Nick.
