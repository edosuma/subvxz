00:10.385 --> 00:14.055
[Alexa] My first year of high school
was a lot different than I pictured.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.267
But cancer didn't stop me from going
to the Winter Formal.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.811
After Katie and I let our hair down
for the dance,

00:19.894 --> 00:22.939
we spent the rest of freshman year
being ourselves.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.733
All versions of ourselves!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.695
It was fun having a boyfriend
on Valentine's Day.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.865
Katie thought so too.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.370
Katie and Ryan decided to just be friends

00:37.454 --> 00:40.665
after they played Von Trapp siblings
in the spring musical.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.793
But if you ask me, there's still a chance

00:43.877 --> 00:46.629
for something special
between Liesl and Friedrich.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.340
And just like that it was summer!

00:50.592 --> 00:54.721
After everything that happened this year,
it was nice to spend time with my family.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.681
Don't tell them I said that.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.351
And before we knew it,
it was the first day of school again.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.395
-Bam!
-Bam!

01:02.979 --> 01:03.938
Bam?

01:04.272 --> 01:06.107
Now I'm not so sure about the shirt.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.026
I... I thought it was cute.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.279
-Not yours, mine!
-Oh! [chuckles]

01:11.446 --> 01:13.156
Oh, I'm so excited for school!

01:13.281 --> 01:16.534
Oh, and this year we will not miss
releasing the wish lanterns.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.036
Like we did last year,

01:18.411 --> 01:20.080
when you got us suspended.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.500
Hey, at least we got to see them
on Lucas's Instagram.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.419
Until he dropped his phone
off the top of the bleachers.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.297
Yeah, he gets really excited around fire.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.092
Oh, what about this?

01:32.467 --> 01:35.053
-Ooh, I like it--
-Yeah, me neither.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.348
[Alexa] I'm so ready for this year.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.017
Now that I've been taking medicine,
things are going back to normal.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.729
Hmm, I know! Now, I almost forgot you had
that checkup last week.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.774
Ugh. Stupid checkups.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.111
They're not stupid. They're how the doctor
knows you're not getting sick again.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.655
-It's just annoying.
-Yeah.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.407
Yeah, I know... but...

01:56.616 --> 02:00.203
you'll get your results on Wednesday,
and they will be fine like always.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.665
-So don't worry.
-[scoffs] My mom is the one who worries.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.793
She obsesses over random stuff,
so she won't think about my results.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.671
Remember her knitting craze
during my February checkup?

02:17.387 --> 02:20.723
This time she's all over my Sweet 16.
Which I don't really care about.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.727
Since when? Okay,
we've talked about our Sweet 16

02:24.853 --> 02:27.147
since... since our awkward 10s.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.234
It's four months away.
But until my checkup results come back,

02:31.317 --> 02:33.736
I gotta get her to focus
on my dad or Lucas.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.447
And... you should wear these.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.783
Hey, I hope she focuses on baking.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.328
Ooh, I'll work the word "fudge"
into conversation.

02:43.872 --> 02:48.168
Hey! So, I've been working on some ideas
for your Sweet 16.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.420
Woo-hoo! [chuckles]

02:51.045 --> 02:54.382
Uh, it's 7:20. [chuckles]
When did you do that?

02:54.757 --> 02:57.635
3:15. That's this morning.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.847
Oh.
[grunts] Wait.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.474
Aha, perfect! No!

03:04.225 --> 03:05.476
Yes, done!
[chuckles]

03:06.811 --> 03:08.563
Hey, Mom, so...

03:08.646 --> 03:11.482
has Lucas started his applications
for college yet?

03:11.566 --> 03:12.567
Tick-tock.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.403
Ooh. Probably not. I should get on that.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.994
Aww! Dylan's first day as a senior outfit!

03:23.119 --> 03:27.540
Aww! Looks a lot like his last day
of summer outfit.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.169
This is it! Perfect!

03:31.794 --> 03:32.629
No.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.631
Yes! Done.

Dad, check out my schedule.
Four blow off classes this year.

04:09.832 --> 04:13.711
It's my last year to enjoy life
before I'm a boring adult like, you know.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.591
-You know you're gesturing to me.
-Yeah, I meant you.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.928
Lucas, have you started
your college applications yet?

04:22.136 --> 04:24.597
You haven't. I knew it.
We're gonna start with your essay, okay?

04:24.681 --> 04:28.142
Come straight home from school.
We'll do it together! Mwah! [chuckles]

04:30.019 --> 04:32.855
What just happened?
Thirty seconds ago, I was happy.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.193
You know how your mom and Alexa get
when we're waiting for Alexa's results.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.821
Yeah, but every time she's had
this checkup, she's been fine.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.783
-That's why you're so chill about it.
-Well, I'm not chill, I'm exhausted.

04:44.158 --> 04:46.244
I can never sleep during a checkup week.
[sighs]

04:46.327 --> 04:48.329
I'm so tired right now
I'm seeing two of you.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.415
Wow! How do we look?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.669
I don't need to worry about Alexa, do I?

04:54.752 --> 04:58.715
No! Since her initial treatment,
every follow-up has been good.

04:58.840 --> 05:03.011
No, we have no reason to think otherwise.
I'm just glad I'm off your mom's radar.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.053
Last checkup,

05:04.178 --> 05:06.306
she made me read four books
on jelly making.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.017
Then she gave me a test.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.021
-Morning!
-[Dave] Hey!

05:13.938 --> 05:16.566
[sighs] I love second breakfast.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.652
See? That's why I told you
not to fill up at home.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.195
Hey, Lucas. [sighs]

05:21.279 --> 05:23.781
Uh, Mom, weren't you going to clean
the garage with Dad?

05:23.865 --> 05:24.741
[mouthing]

05:24.824 --> 05:26.951
Yeah, you know, Dave,
we should clean out the garage.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.911
It's full of all your jelly jars.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.623
Uh... Oh, Potato needs a walk. I'll do it.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.293
-Oh great. I'll go get his leash.
-Ah, don't. No time.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.794
I'll just hold his collar.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.880
[audience laughing]

05:39.714 --> 05:41.716
Hey, Lori, how's it going?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.052
A little stressful this week, huh?

05:44.302 --> 05:47.013
Oh no!
[chuckles] I'm not worried.

05:47.138 --> 05:50.850
C'mon, Alexa will be fine.
Have you ever thought about solar panels?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.811
Nope? I bet you and I can put them up
in one day.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.813
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.608
Girls, let's go
if you want a ride to school.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.528
Oh, hey, listen, honey, after your dad
and I clean out the garage,

06:02.612 --> 06:04.822
I'm gonna go look at venues
for your Sweet 16!

06:04.906 --> 06:07.408
Thanks, Mom, but you know
I don't care about that.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.661
Are you kidding?
Listen, you're gonna turn 35...

06:10.787 --> 06:12.080
many times.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.666
But you're only gonna have
one 16th birthday!

06:16.709 --> 06:17.627
C'mon, Katie!

06:19.504 --> 06:23.549
I'm coming! Nothing's going to keep me
from my first day of school! Aah!

06:28.638 --> 06:30.640
[students chattering]

06:31.891 --> 06:35.395
-Clear a path!
-It's just a little ankle twist.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.979
You don't have to do that.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.191
This time last year,
you shaved your head for me.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.402
The least I can do is carry your things
and clear a--

06:42.485 --> 06:44.612
Melissa, pick a side!

06:44.946 --> 06:47.782
It's a... a cute shirt, Melissa!

06:49.450 --> 06:51.786
-I'm really glad you got hurt.
-Huh?

06:53.329 --> 06:55.415
It's just nice to help you for a change.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.375
Like before cancer
when we supported each other.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.877
-Good thing I'm so klutzy!
-Ha-ha.

07:00.336 --> 07:04.715
Ooh! Sophomore hall,
sophomore lockers!

07:04.799 --> 07:05.883
Sophomore stranger!

07:07.510 --> 07:08.344
Cody?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.722
Seriously, guys, we've gone to school
together since kindergarten.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.101
-I'm just kidding. I just moved here.
-Oh.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.688
-Hi, I'm Alexa.
-Katie. Oh!

07:18.771 --> 07:19.981
Hey, I've... I've got her!

07:20.857 --> 07:22.483
[Alexa] All right. Here's you.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.318
[locker door opens]

07:24.902 --> 07:26.279
And... here's me!

07:26.571 --> 07:28.781
Oh, right by each other! [giggles]

07:29.991 --> 07:30.825
Notebook.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.121
Pens.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.250
Mirror.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.211
Maybe I should just switch lockers
with one of you guys?

07:42.336 --> 07:43.838
No, you're not bothering us.

07:43.921 --> 07:44.881
Oh, good.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.884
Super cute photo of us.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.053
-Oh! How could I not put this up?
-I know!

07:51.137 --> 07:52.555
Look how long our hair is.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.515
I like your short hair.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.686
So, I'll see you guys around?

07:59.228 --> 08:01.647
Or, after every class
when I go to my locker?

08:02.064 --> 08:04.484
Maybe I'll just get, like,
a really big backpack.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.986
[audience laughing]

08:07.570 --> 08:08.404
Did you hear that?

08:08.488 --> 08:11.240
He doesn't realize that this is
a hair grow, not a hair cut.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.703
I love that there's a person at school
who doesn't know about the cancer.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.372
-See? More normal already.
-Hmm.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.416
-Hey, guys!
-Hey!

08:20.541 --> 08:21.459
Cool crutches.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.586
I almost wore an eyepatch.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.880
[audience laughing]

08:26.130 --> 08:28.007
Why are you in a cheerleading uniform?

08:28.090 --> 08:30.718
Oh, her mom told her she had to go out
for something this year.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.428
'Cause she was getting lazy.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.473
I picked cheerleading
because tryouts were next to my house.

08:35.890 --> 08:36.807
I am lazy.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.436
I'm just glad you guys are here
on the first day this year.

08:40.561 --> 08:43.898
I know! Last year,
you missed the wish lanterns.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.901
My wish... was that you guys had been
at school that day.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.986
I wished for an iPad. [chuckles]

08:49.570 --> 08:50.404
Sorry.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.532
[bell rings]

08:53.074 --> 08:54.033
I'm helping Katie!

08:55.368 --> 08:56.869
Save us a seat in class? [chuckles]

08:58.538 --> 09:02.083
That was really nice of them,
but it's pretty clear that I got this.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.001
Wait, watch out!

09:04.877 --> 09:07.129
-Not--
-Uh... Whoa!

09:07.505 --> 09:08.589
[thud]

09:08.714 --> 09:10.049
I'm coming for you, Katie!

09:11.092 --> 09:12.802
Was it me, or was that nurse judgy?

09:12.885 --> 09:16.264
She kept putting air quotes
around the words "accident" and "friend."

09:16.347 --> 09:19.016
Yeah, well two can play that game, nurse!

09:20.434 --> 09:23.354
-Hey, I can hold my stuff.
-No, I've got this.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.523
Your recovery is my number-one priority.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.524
[phone chimes]

09:29.443 --> 09:33.447
[scoffs] Hey, now my mom is texting me
ideas for my Sweet 16.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.325
Man,
the stress must really be getting to her.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.202
-Alexa!
-Hey!

09:38.369 --> 09:40.246
Hey, I was afraid
I wasn't gonna see you all day.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.498
I know. I've been helping Katie.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.334
I like the outfit, senior.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.170
Thanks! I picked it out myself. [chuckles]

09:49.714 --> 09:51.757
Hey, if you want me to go to the doctor's
with you--

09:51.841 --> 09:52.717
It's fine.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.511
Yeah, everyone's making
such a big deal out of it, but I'm fine.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.347
Okay, well, I'm not tutoring,
so I can just easily--

09:58.472 --> 10:01.183
-[bell rings]
-Oh, sorry, gotta get Katie to class!

10:01.934 --> 10:03.936
-She hates being late!
-[Katie whimpers]

10:05.730 --> 10:07.732
College essay, complete.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.984
Mmm. [chuckles] All right.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.944
"To further myself..."

10:12.528 --> 10:14.447
"Part of a college community..."

10:15.489 --> 10:17.241
"Game room looks dope..."

10:18.492 --> 10:19.910
"I'm hungry"?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.246
I am hungry.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.668
You know, honey, I think your charm
is being wasted on the page.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.128
No, let's do a video essay.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.589
You don't need me for that, do you?

10:33.174 --> 10:36.969
Mom! What were some of your ideas
for Alexa's Sweet 16?

10:37.511 --> 10:39.347
I don't want a party.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.058
Oh, honey, everybody wants
a Sweet 16 party.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.809
And yet Alexa doesn't. Hmm.

10:43.934 --> 10:47.480
You two need to talk this out.
Don't be afraid to dig deep.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.564
I'll be in my room.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.610
Yeah, you're not going anywhere
until this video essay is done.

10:52.693 --> 10:53.694
[Dave yawns]

10:54.111 --> 10:55.655
Oh good, Dad's here.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.200
What's that, Jen? I sure can walk Potato.

11:04.121 --> 11:07.124
-[sighs] Can I play a game on your phone?
-No. Give it to me.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.918
I will roll over your toes!

11:09.960 --> 11:11.462
[Jack grunts]

11:13.964 --> 11:14.882
Mom, help me!

11:15.800 --> 11:17.218
Jack, go play upstairs.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.471
I know I'm a busy mom,

11:20.554 --> 11:23.891
but I'm pretty sure the last time
I saw you, you just had crutches.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.979
Oh, no, it's actually feeling better.
Oh, and Alexa's been really helpful.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.648
Really, really helpful.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.650
Intensely scary helpful.

11:33.901 --> 11:38.489
Well, maybe helping you is taking Alexa's
mind off waiting for her checkup results.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.991
Well, but, she told me she's not worried
about it.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.328
You know how hard this week always is
for the Mendozas.

11:44.662 --> 11:48.207
Lori weeded our front yard,
and Dave kidnapped Potato!

11:48.332 --> 11:50.167
[audience laughing]

11:51.335 --> 11:53.003
Maybe we should eat out tonight.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.549
Wait, how could I not see this?

11:56.632 --> 11:59.135
This totally explains
why she's been acting this way.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.680
The subconscious mind is a powerful
and mysterious thing.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.850
I've been studying this exact thing
in class.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.936
You know, I could let you read it,
but it might be a little over your head.

12:09.019 --> 12:09.854
[chuckles]

12:11.063 --> 12:13.399
Mom, that's a Nicholas Sparks
romance novel.

12:13.899 --> 12:17.194
Yuck, I don't... That's not mine.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.740
Someone must have stuck it in here,

12:21.073 --> 12:22.450
like a joke.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.370
...and that's when I knew
humans couldn't fly.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.082
This leads me to a list
of my personal favorite traits.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.711
Happy. Kind. Funny.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.588
Good with lists.

12:36.422 --> 12:40.176
Okay, try doing it again,
but without moving your hands so much.

12:40.968 --> 12:45.389
-People don't talk without their hands.
-Yes, they do. Every day.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.391
All day.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.435
Well, not me.

12:49.810 --> 12:50.853
I'm Italian.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.898
No, you're not.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.360
Okay. [clears throat]
I have an idea. Stay there.

12:59.153 --> 12:59.987
Dad.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.031
[Dave panting]

13:02.281 --> 13:03.574
I'm too tired to tag in.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.576
Hang in there, Alexa.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.037
-I'm Lucas.
-That's my girl.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.252
Hey, look at you, honey!

13:15.377 --> 13:17.463
-Yeah, yeah, it really was just a twist.
-[phone dings]

13:18.964 --> 13:21.717
Ha! Alexa. Says she's gonna push you
to school.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.554
Push? Oy, but school's three miles away!

13:25.888 --> 13:28.766
-Hey, what should I do?
-Tell her you're better!

13:29.350 --> 13:32.603
No, but if helping me, is helping her
not think about it, then...

13:33.103 --> 13:35.981
-[grunts] Ugh, okay, I can't be better.
-I'll re-hurt you!

13:36.315 --> 13:37.525
[both] No!

13:38.567 --> 13:40.820
You have to be honest with Alexa.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.614
Nothing good comes from lying.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.493
It was my Nicholas Sparks book.

13:49.453 --> 13:52.206
Look, just, c'mon, talk to her.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.084
Yeah, you're right.
I need to be honest.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.837
But not now. Here she comes! [grunts]

13:58.546 --> 14:00.798
-Katie!
-Hey, did you get my text?

14:00.881 --> 14:02.716
I don't want you to deal with people
on the bus.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.678
And good news: I found a shortcut
through the woods!

14:06.470 --> 14:07.471
The woods?

14:07.721 --> 14:09.723
[mouthing]

14:12.184 --> 14:16.313
Um, Mom, Mom, can't you give us a ride?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.859
I would,
but the Today Show is running a segment

14:19.942 --> 14:21.569
on honesty in friendship.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.696
[audience laughing]

14:29.618 --> 14:33.163
Sorry, I forgot all the bushes would be
at your face level.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.207
It's... it's fine.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.960
[giggles] Not all of them had thorns.

14:38.168 --> 14:39.962
-Hey!
-Hey, Ryan.

14:40.045 --> 14:40.921
Katie!

14:41.213 --> 14:43.048
-I'm fine. No big deal.
-Yeah.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.009
I'm taking care of her, Ryan.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.844
[mouthing]

14:47.761 --> 14:50.931
-What?
-What? No, I didn't say anything.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.475
Okay, well, I'm glad I found you. Um...

14:53.559 --> 14:55.895
I just heard that the drama club
is picking students

14:55.978 --> 14:57.062
to go to London this spring.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.523
-Wait, wait, London?
-Yeah.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.359
It's a week long study abroad trip
all about theater.

15:02.443 --> 15:06.655
Oh, yeah. "Scene studies, theater history,
going to plays"?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.408
-Yeah, it sounds awesome, right?
-Uh, yes!

15:09.491 --> 15:11.827
-Okay, I need to go sign up.
-I'm on it.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.622
Wait, I already put you
on the consideration list.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.373
Oh, thanks.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.460
-Yeah, you're welcome. Bye.
-Bye. [chuckles]

15:23.923 --> 15:26.592
-Wow. Bye!
-Bye.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.928
Okay, we all said goodbye.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.347
[sighs]

15:31.931 --> 15:33.098
This looks amazing.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.603
Oops!

15:38.020 --> 15:40.773
So, I'm thinking that I'll skip
all of my classes today,

15:40.856 --> 15:43.025
so I can just be with you 24/7.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.693
That's the mistake I made yesterday.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.071
Um, Alexa?

15:47.738 --> 15:50.741
I know you said you're not stressed
about your appointment tomorrow--

15:50.824 --> 15:52.034
Yeah, because I'm not.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.955
Exactly. Um, and I... I wanted...

15:56.163 --> 16:00.000
to say that... that you not being worried
has really been great because...

16:00.084 --> 16:01.794
you've been so helpful to me...

16:02.336 --> 16:04.171
-when I needed you.
-Good.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.299
Is this a bad time for me to get
to my locker?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.176
'Cause I could do like two more laps.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.013
Too bad you can't go to
that lantern wishing thing tonight.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.600
Oh, wow, right, that's... that's tonight.

16:16.976 --> 16:17.935
Why can't she?

16:18.018 --> 16:19.853
Because it's at the top of the bleachers?

16:20.688 --> 16:21.522
She's doing it!

16:22.314 --> 16:25.401
Or... she... she could set hers off
from the ground.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.695
Where she can't get hurt.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.198
No. Setting off the lanterns
from the top of the bleachers

16:31.281 --> 16:32.324
is the tradition!

16:32.408 --> 16:34.576
And Katie is my best friend. So,

16:34.702 --> 16:37.913
I don't care if it's the top of
the bleachers, or the top of a mountain,

16:38.038 --> 16:39.498
I'm getting her there no matter what!

16:41.333 --> 16:44.336
You know, I'm just going to grab
everything I need for the rest of the day.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.507
-[Cody] Ooh.
-[Katie] Uh.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.679
She needs this, Cody. She needs this.

17:01.770 --> 17:02.604
Hey!

17:03.105 --> 17:05.107
[audience laughing]

17:05.190 --> 17:06.525
This seems healthy.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.695
I think it's going well.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.035
Okay, well, this should do it. All right.
[sighs]

17:16.160 --> 17:18.120
Okay.
[hisses then clears throat]

17:18.579 --> 17:19.496
You're on.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.041
Hi. I'm Lucas Mendoza.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.752
Okay. Honey,
it should be much easier than that.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.296
Dad? Jennifer? A little help?

17:28.297 --> 17:32.217
Oh, yeah. When I get back.
I'm just on my way to walk Potato.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.054
-I'm on my way to walk Potato.
-When did you get here?

17:35.137 --> 17:36.430
[audience laughing]

17:36.513 --> 17:39.725
-Look, he's my dog, so, yeah--
-Oh, now he's your dog!

17:41.852 --> 17:43.729
Stop trying to wiggle free!

17:43.812 --> 17:45.481
[audience laughing]

17:49.068 --> 17:50.069
[Katie whimpers]

17:50.778 --> 17:52.863
Uh! Okay, right here is good!

17:53.197 --> 17:56.575
You've been saying that since
the first step! We're almost to the top.

17:57.159 --> 17:57.993
Whoa!

17:58.660 --> 18:00.996
Hey! Hold on, we'll help!

18:01.080 --> 18:02.414
-I've got it!
-Okay.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.708
[audience laughing]

18:05.626 --> 18:10.589
-I'm... really glad we're doing this!
-[Katie whimpers]

18:11.924 --> 18:13.425
Ugh! In the way.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.934
-All right.
-[whimpers] Okay.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.312
Whoa! Yeah, right... right  here is good--

18:25.395 --> 18:28.273
-Whoa, whoa--
-Okay, I can't do it! I can't do it!

18:28.524 --> 18:30.859
[in a pleading tone] I wanna live!

18:31.068 --> 18:33.821
What? You're okay?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.489
Look, I'm sorry, I just...

18:35.572 --> 18:38.075
I just wanted you to have something
to focus on,

18:38.158 --> 18:39.618
other than your checkup results.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.703
So you were faking this whole time.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.789
No...

18:44.706 --> 18:46.041
Yeah, most of the time.

18:46.708 --> 18:50.170
Seriously?
I'm supposed to be taking care of you.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.506
You're not supposed to be taking care
of me.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.675
This year was going to be different.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.511
I'm... I'm sorry.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.888
[people chattering]

19:00.305 --> 19:01.598
[Katie breathes heavily]

19:03.559 --> 19:07.062
Maybe these stupid checkups
still make me nervous.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.191
It's not like I'm expecting
to hear bad news.

19:12.818 --> 19:16.697
But I wasn't expecting to hear bad news
the day that I found out I had cancer.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.740
[huffs]

19:18.991 --> 19:20.742
How are things supposed to
go back to normal

19:20.826 --> 19:23.495
-when I still have two more years of this?
-Hmm.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.914
Then I treat you
like you need to be taken care of,

19:26.039 --> 19:28.167
by letting you take care of me,

19:28.250 --> 19:29.418
even though I'm...

19:29.501 --> 19:31.670
taking care of you, taking care of me.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.174
[sighs] I guess it was a crazy idea?

19:36.049 --> 19:37.885
Yeah, maybe I was a little crazy too.

19:38.051 --> 19:40.053
[both sigh]

19:41.889 --> 19:43.223
You just have to be there.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.017
That's all.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.436
-Always.
-[Alexa chuckles]

19:47.769 --> 19:49.646
All right, let's go light our lanterns.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.983
[kids] Three, two, one. Woo!

19:53.066 --> 19:55.611
Yeah, so, um... next year?

19:55.986 --> 19:58.155
Yeah, let's not promise
ourselves anything.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.664
-[doctor] Everything looks--
-[rustling]

20:07.748 --> 20:09.917
[Dave grunts then sighs]

20:10.626 --> 20:12.169
-[rustling stops]
-Sorry.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.923
Everything looks great.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.841
[Alexa gasps then chuckles]

20:17.966 --> 20:19.801
-Just like I thought.
-Me too.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.929
[both] She gets a little crazy.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.098
Well, I know how happy you'll be to hear,

20:25.182 --> 20:27.392
you can even go out
for basketball this year.

20:27.851 --> 20:28.936
Oh? Really?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.687
But what if at my next checkup--

20:30.771 --> 20:32.856
My job is to think
about your next checkup.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.858
Your job is to live your life.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.070
-Got it.
-[doctor] Okay, Mendozas...

20:38.403 --> 20:41.573
and Katie...
I'll see you at the next checkup.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.501
She's good.

20:53.710 --> 20:54.586
She's good.

21:00.717 --> 21:01.969
I wasn't worried either.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.808
[knock on door then opens]

21:08.558 --> 21:09.893
-Hey!
-Hey.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.770
Whatcha working on?

21:12.688 --> 21:15.565
I was thinking of something like this
for my Sweet 16.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.027
Oh, I like that.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.904
-Oh, I love that.
-[chuckles]

21:21.154 --> 21:24.825
Yeah, just to warn you I've decided
I'm gonna have the best Sweet 16 ever!

21:25.492 --> 21:27.703
-Lucas can pay for his own college.
-[Alexa chuckles]

21:27.786 --> 21:29.204
[phone chimes]

21:30.330 --> 21:31.164
[gasps]

21:31.498 --> 21:33.458
-It's Dylan again.
-Aww.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.961
He must be really happy
about your appointment.

21:37.087 --> 21:39.047
-Pretty happy.
-[Katie] Alexa!

21:39.339 --> 21:40.716
Ooh! Gotta go.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.304
"I wish for Katie to get picked to go
to London with the drama club"?

21:46.179 --> 21:48.181
You're supposed to make a wish
for yourself.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.850
But you used your wish on me.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.144
-No!
-Uh-huh.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.732
"I wish for Alexa to have the best
Sweet 16 party ever."

21:57.316 --> 21:58.734
Mmm! 'Cause I wanna go!

22:09.745 --> 22:10.579
Oh!

22:10.746 --> 22:12.748
[audience laughing]

22:13.457 --> 22:14.291
I'm going in.
