WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:07.700
Captain's Log,
Stardate 54208.3.

00:07.807 --> 00:10.935
Last month's datastream
from Starfleet never arrived,

00:11.011 --> 00:12.740
so the crew is looking forward
to this one

00:12.812 --> 00:15.110
with even more anticipation
than usual.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.706
We could all use some news
from home.

00:20.453 --> 00:23.547
Ah. There he is,
the man of the hour.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.113
You sure are in a good mood.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.749
Well, rumor has it you snared

00:26.826 --> 00:28.657
the latest datastream
last night.

00:28.728 --> 00:30.423
Technically,
it was this morning--

00:30.497 --> 00:31.623
0200 to be exact.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.427
So where's my mail?

00:33.500 --> 00:34.933
Hmm?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.935
Oh. Don't tell me
you lost another one.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.267
l didn't lose
last month's datastream.

00:39.339 --> 00:40.306
lt never arrived.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.874
So what's the
holdup this time?

00:41.975 --> 00:44.443
The transmission was
a little larger than usual.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.875
lt's jammed
the transceiver.

00:45.945 --> 00:47.674
Seven and l have
been up all night

00:47.747 --> 00:48.873
trying to download it.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.006
Harry...

00:50.083 --> 00:52.108
we can't go another month
without mail.

00:52.185 --> 00:53.447
Oh, you won't.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.680
Trust me.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.225
Any luck?

01:02.295 --> 01:05.093
l've determined why
we've been having difficulties.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.992
A hologram.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.128
The transceiver
wasn't designed

01:12.238 --> 01:13.899
to store photonic data.

01:14.074 --> 01:17.373
We have to get it out of there
before it degrades.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.105
What are you doing?

01:19.179 --> 01:21.943
Tying the transceiver into
the holodeck's pattern buffer.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.778
Those systems aren't compatible.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.442
You'll depolarize the relays.

01:25.518 --> 01:27.679
Starfleet wouldn't
have sent this hologram

01:27.754 --> 01:28.948
if it weren't important.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.353
l'm sure it's worth
a few burnt-out relays.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.653
You've overloaded
the transceiver.

01:36.729 --> 01:40.722
But l saved the hologram.

01:42.902 --> 01:45.871
Okay, ready when you are.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.104
Lieutenant Barclay?

01:52.178 --> 01:53.839
Uh... no,
but he did design me.

01:53.913 --> 01:55.175
l'm a walking, talking,

01:55.248 --> 01:57.273
problem-solving
interactive hologram.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.409
You can call me Reg.

01:59.486 --> 02:01.215
lt's nice to meet you, Reg.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.549
The pleasure's mine, Captain.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.055
Harry, Seven...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.285
l've been looking forward
to working with you.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.291
You have?

02:07.360 --> 02:08.622
l know-- you were
expecting letters

02:08.695 --> 02:10.252
from your friends and families.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.264
But with any luck,
in a few days,

02:12.332 --> 02:15.927
you'll be seeing them
face-to-face.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:05.078 --> 04:06.477
ln three days' time,

04:06.546 --> 04:10.346
Voyager is going to be
passing through Grid 898--

04:10.416 --> 04:14.011
a sector of space occupied
by a red giant star.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.748
Sensors detected it
a few days ago.

04:15.822 --> 04:18.120
At this very moment,
a team of Federation scientists

04:18.190 --> 04:21.160
is orbiting another red giant
in the Alpha Quadrant.

04:21.226 --> 04:25.391
ln 72 hours, they will target
its magnetic field

04:25.465 --> 04:27.831
with a verteron beam,

04:27.900 --> 04:29.731
creating a geodesic fold.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.737
As a result, a corresponding
fold will open here

04:32.805 --> 04:35.103
in the magnetic field
of the red giant

04:35.174 --> 04:36.732
that Voyager is approaching.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.438
Space will be punctured...
these two points

04:40.513 --> 04:43.209
creating a gateway
between the quadrants.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.150
Our shields are useless
against geodesic radiation.

04:46.219 --> 04:49.052
We toyed with the idea
of opening a fold ourselves,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.181
but it didn't take us
long to realize

04:51.257 --> 04:52.918
we wouldn't survive the trip.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.960
A lot's happened
in geodesic research

04:55.061 --> 04:56.289
since you've been gone.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.660
l've brought schematics
for shield upgrades

04:58.731 --> 05:00.722
to deflect the radiation
from the fold,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.358
medical technology to provide

05:02.468 --> 05:03.867
additional protection
for the crew.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.163
We've thought of everything.

05:05.271 --> 05:06.602
Starfleet never mentioned you

05:06.673 --> 05:08.368
in any of the
previous datastreams.

05:08.441 --> 05:11.069
Well, Lieutenant Barclay
didn't want to raise your hopes,

05:11.144 --> 05:13.408
in case the plan didn't
live up to expectation,

05:13.479 --> 05:15.242
but lucky for you,
it surpassed them.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.579
What about
last month's datastream?

05:17.650 --> 05:19.242
Why didn't we receive it?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.719
Pathfinder tried sending
an unabridged version

05:21.788 --> 05:23.050
of my program.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.749
lt overloaded the MlDAS Array.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.349
And the only casualty this time
was our transceiver.

05:27.427 --> 05:29.452
lf everything goes
according to plan,

05:29.529 --> 05:31.463
you won't need it anymore.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.465
lf we were to attempt this,

05:33.533 --> 05:36.525
you'd need access
to areas of this ship

05:36.636 --> 05:39.662
that aren't equipped
with holo-emitters.

05:39.772 --> 05:41.364
Not to worry, Captain.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.942
We've thought of that, too.

05:44.043 --> 05:47.638
My emitter is your emitter.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.579
Computer, transfer
the Barclay hologram

05:49.649 --> 05:51.640
to the mobile emitter.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.879
Transfer complete.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.387
On Lieutenant Barclay's
behalf, l thank you.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.890
Just make sure to return
it when we get to Earth.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.725
We're ready for you

06:01.794 --> 06:03.318
in the briefing room, Captain.

06:03.396 --> 06:04.988
Excuse us, Doctor.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.531
l'm sure you have
a full day planned,

06:06.599 --> 06:07.531
but if you have time,

06:07.600 --> 06:09.090
l'd like to get
better acquainted.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.669
l'll stop by
the first chance l get.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.829
You'll know where to find me.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.338
This is our destination--

06:14.407 --> 06:16.967
Red Giant 23139.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.477
The geodesic fold
will open here,

06:19.545 --> 06:21.445
adjacent to the giant's
northern pole.

06:21.514 --> 06:25.177
We'll have exactly 16 seconds
to take Voyager through.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.116
Reg has prepared
a list of assignments.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.312
l expect you to give him

06:28.388 --> 06:29.514
your full cooperation.

06:29.589 --> 06:30.988
Mr. Paris, you have the honor

06:31.057 --> 06:32.820
of plotting our course
to Big Red 2.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.826
Lieutenant Torres,
Commander Tuvok,

06:34.894 --> 06:37.658
l'd like you to start working
on shield modifications.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.630
And in the meantime,
l've asked the Doctor

06:39.699 --> 06:41.223
to prepare a series
of inoculations

06:41.334 --> 06:43.393
that will protect the
crew from the radiation.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.868
We should discuss
the possibility

06:44.937 --> 06:47.405
of applying Borg technology
to Starfleet's plan.

06:47.507 --> 06:48.701
lt could increase

06:48.775 --> 06:50.299
our chances of success.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.503
l look forward
to hearing your thoughts.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.341
How long before
the transceiver's back on line?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.847
No more than two hours.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.882
Then we'll still have time

06:56.949 --> 06:58.382
to transmit a
response to Starfleet.

06:58.451 --> 06:59.884
Keep us posted.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.249
l'd like to send
Lieutenant Barclay

07:01.354 --> 07:03.254
a little thank-you note
for all his hard work.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.481
Um, uh, is there...

07:05.558 --> 07:07.355
is there anything l can do, Reg?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.419
Your job might be the
most important one of all.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.157
The next few days
will be difficult.

07:12.231 --> 07:14.392
The crew will be working
extremely long hours.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.695
They're going to need an
experienced Morale Officer

07:16.803 --> 07:18.065
to keep their spirits high.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.798
You can count on me.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.641
lf this were any other ship...

07:24.710 --> 07:27.338
l'd have my doubts.

07:27.413 --> 07:30.314
But this is Voyager,
''the miracle ship.''

07:30.383 --> 07:33.875
You've survived six years
in the Delta Quadrant.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.888
You've evaded the Kazon,
the Vidiians, the Hirogen.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.584
You've even faced down the Borg.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.492
l think, with a little teamwork,

07:42.562 --> 07:44.587
we can pull off
one more miracle

07:44.664 --> 07:47.531
and take Voyager home.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.659
l can taste my
mom's cooking.

07:49.769 --> 07:52.465
Don't forget what
the hologram said, Harry:

07:52.572 --> 07:53.937
''This is Voyager...

07:54.006 --> 07:55.405
''The miracle ship''!

07:55.475 --> 07:57.136
Uh, not when it comes
to getting us home.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.373
Our shortcuts have a tendency
to blow up in our faces.

08:00.446 --> 08:02.175
Well, that's looking
on the bright side.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.239
Well, remember Arturis

08:04.317 --> 08:06.410
and his quantum
slipstream drive?

08:06.486 --> 08:10.115
Or, um, or how about
the telepathic pitcher plant

08:10.189 --> 08:11.986
that made us think
we were on our way home

08:12.058 --> 08:14.253
right before it tried
to eat the ship.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.817
This is the best opportunity
we've had.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.192
Yeah, which is why

08:17.263 --> 08:19.390
we'll probably end up
in the Gamma Quadrant.

08:19.465 --> 08:20.762
l'll remind you of that when

08:20.833 --> 08:21.822
we get back to Earth.

08:21.934 --> 08:22.832
Don't say l didn't warn you.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.527
When a Borg cube enters

08:24.637 --> 08:26.468
a transwarp conduit,
it's subject

08:26.539 --> 08:28.166
to extreme
gravimetric shear.

08:28.274 --> 08:29.366
To compensate, the Borg

08:29.475 --> 08:31.238
project a structural
integrity field

08:31.310 --> 08:32.777
ahead of the cube.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.244
By modifying
Voyager's deflector,

08:34.313 --> 08:36.212
we may be able to do the same.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.682
No one at Starfleet
would have thought of this.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.653
So, what's the first thing

08:42.722 --> 08:44.087
you're going to do
when you get back?

08:44.155 --> 08:46.181
Begin repairs to Voyager.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.090
Even with the structural
integrity field,

08:48.160 --> 08:50.424
it's likely the ship
will suffer significant damage.

08:50.496 --> 08:53.624
Yes, but, l mean, there are
people at Utopia Planitia

08:53.699 --> 08:54.666
who will take care of that.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.292
There are Engineering crews
and technicians...

08:56.402 --> 08:58.597
Are you implying that
l am superfluous?

08:58.704 --> 09:00.001
Of course not.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.267
l only meant that if
you're too busy working,

09:02.341 --> 09:05.708
you're going to miss all
the ''welcome home'' hoopla.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.370
Starfleet's planning parties.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.573
They'll have ceremonies
and speeches.

09:09.649 --> 09:13.710
There, there's a ticker-tape
parade down Market Street.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.777
l won't be attending
any of those events.

09:15.855 --> 09:19.052
But you'd be the guest of honor.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.957
When l first arrived
on Voyager,

09:23.029 --> 09:26.226
it was difficult
for the crew to accept me.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.699
l'm anticipating
a similar welcome on Earth.

09:28.768 --> 09:35.469
You don't have
any idea, do you?

09:35.541 --> 09:38.339
l didn't mention this earlier.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.971
l didn't want to hurt
anybody's feelings...

09:41.047 --> 09:42.537
but you are the one

09:42.615 --> 09:44.981
who people are most
looking forward to seeing.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.848
That's difficult to believe.

09:46.919 --> 09:47.851
Why?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.319
l was Borg.

09:49.388 --> 09:50.821
Exactly.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.585
You were Borg,

09:52.658 --> 09:53.886
but you escaped.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.017
And despite incredible odds,

09:56.095 --> 09:57.221
you managed to reclaim

09:57.296 --> 09:59.355
your humanity.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.626
No one's ever done that before.

10:00.700 --> 10:01.632
You're famous.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.896
Fame is irrelevant.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.937
Maybe...

10:06.038 --> 10:07.596
but you've given hope

10:07.707 --> 10:10.175
to everyone who's ever
lost somebody to the Borg.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.510
You've inspired millions.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.714
lf you think my participation
in the ''hoopla''

10:21.787 --> 10:25.223
would be beneficial to others,
then l'll comply.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.805
ls this going to take
much longer, Reg?

10:41.874 --> 10:44.308
Well, the computer is
still inputting data.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.004
That should do it.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.445
All right. Computer, display
the intended trajectory

10:49.515 --> 10:51.312
of the datastream transmitted

10:51.384 --> 10:52.851
at 0600 this morning.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.349
Now, display
the actual trajectory

10:58.424 --> 11:00.051
and identify
the termination point.

11:00.126 --> 11:03.027
The trajectory ends
in Sector 395...

11:03.095 --> 11:05.086
42, Grid 8.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.896
Does that sound familiar?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.797
That's exactly
where the datastream

11:09.902 --> 11:11.062
dissipated last month.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.797
There is something there.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.896
There is something
preventing the datastream

11:15.007 --> 11:16.474
from reaching Voyager.

11:16.575 --> 11:19.408
Uh, a micro-wormhole,
a radiogenic field...

11:19.478 --> 11:20.638
Long-range scans

11:20.713 --> 11:22.146
didn't pick up
anything unusual.

11:22.214 --> 11:26.275
Well, still, we could send
a ship to investigate.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.842
We could confirm my theory.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.512
What about my theory, Reg?

11:29.588 --> 11:32.056
The hologram was too complex.

11:32.124 --> 11:33.682
lt caused the data
streams to degrade

11:33.759 --> 11:35.386
before they reached
their destination.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.156
Well, to be honest...

11:37.229 --> 11:40.630
l... l don't agree.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.158
The truth is, we don't know
what happened to my hologram.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.830
Then let's stick
to what we do know.

11:46.939 --> 11:48.566
For the second
month in a row,

11:48.674 --> 11:50.699
we tried sending your
hologram to Voyager.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.277
And for the second
month in a row,

11:52.344 --> 11:53.368
it failed to get there.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.471
And l want to know why,
so it doesn't happen

11:55.548 --> 11:56.480
a third time.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.073
lt won't happen a third time.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.313
Next month, we go back
to standard transmissions.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.912
But a holographic matrix
carries twice the information,

12:05.024 --> 12:06.548
interact with the crew...

12:06.625 --> 12:08.889
Admiral Paris wants us
to send more practical data,

12:08.994 --> 12:10.154
like tactical upgrades,

12:10.229 --> 12:11.662
letters from the
crew's families.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.255
But, Pete...

12:13.332 --> 12:15.698
Sending a hologram
to Voyager was a good idea,

12:15.801 --> 12:17.234
but it didn't work.

12:17.303 --> 12:20.329
lt's time to move on.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.847
And this is the research lab,

12:29.915 --> 12:33.681
where most of Pathfinder's
homework gets done.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.381
All the datastreams
are compressed here

12:36.455 --> 12:37.683
and then transmitted

12:37.757 --> 12:39.725
all the way to
the Delta Quadrant.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.192
Your teacher tells me
you've been studying

12:42.261 --> 12:43.626
some of the Delta Quadrant races

12:43.696 --> 12:45.163
that Voyager
has described to us.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.698
Who can name one for me?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.324
The Talaxians.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.526
Very good.

12:49.635 --> 12:50.624
The Ocampa.

12:50.736 --> 12:51.828
That's right. Who else?

12:51.937 --> 12:53.165
The Borg!

12:53.272 --> 12:54.239
The Borg!

12:54.340 --> 12:55.602
They assimilated my hologram.

12:55.674 --> 12:56.834
That's how it disappeared.

12:56.909 --> 12:57.841
Reg, now isn't the time.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.571
Look at this-- last
month, a spacecraft

12:59.645 --> 13:01.840
passed within 20 meters
of the MlDAS Array,

13:01.947 --> 13:04.415
just hours before
we sent the first hologram.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.439
What is your point?

13:05.518 --> 13:06.746
20 meters.

13:06.819 --> 13:08.377
lt's awfully close,
don't you think?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.113
Ensign.

13:09.188 --> 13:10.621
Look, the Borg must

13:10.689 --> 13:13.487
have sent a transwarp probe
to steal my hologram.

13:13.559 --> 13:16.255
Maybe because they, they thought
that it was carrying

13:16.328 --> 13:18.125
anti-Borg technology
to Voyager.

13:18.197 --> 13:19.824
lt wasn't the Borg, Reg.

13:19.899 --> 13:22.629
Then it was the Romulans
using a cloaked ship.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.532
They've been curious
about Voyager for years...

13:24.637 --> 13:25.569
That is enough.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.696
But, you...

13:26.806 --> 13:28.103
l am sorry your idea

13:28.174 --> 13:29.664
didn't work,
but l can't have you

13:29.775 --> 13:31.174
going off on a tangent.

13:31.243 --> 13:32.642
Not again.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.874
You'll be no good
to Pathfinder or Voyager.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.242
How much leave

13:39.318 --> 13:41.047
do you have saved up?

13:41.120 --> 13:43.054
Not that much.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.955
50... maybe 60 days.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.356
Take a week, go home.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.358
Try to relax.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.257
But, Pete...

13:49.328 --> 13:50.693
No. That was not

13:50.763 --> 13:52.390
a request, Lieutenant.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.504
Maybe l'll go somewhere...

14:02.341 --> 14:03.740
take a vacation.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.744
Now that is the most
sensible thing

14:06.812 --> 14:09.076
l've heard you say all day.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.343
My cousin has
a beach house in Malaysia.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.544
She'd be happy
to lend it to you.

14:14.954 --> 14:21.052
Thanks, um, but l have
someplace else in mind.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.828
You, you wanted to see me?

14:30.936 --> 14:32.995
l've been going over
the instructions

14:33.105 --> 14:34.299
from Starfleet Medical.

14:34.406 --> 14:37.034
As far as l can tell,
their ''new'' inoculations

14:37.109 --> 14:38.303
aren't much different

14:38.377 --> 14:40.743
from run-of-the-mill
radiogenic vaccines.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.077
l don't think
they'll protect the crew.

14:43.148 --> 14:45.616
Did you try incorporating
a synthetic antigen?

14:45.684 --> 14:49.643
Yes, but it only improved
the resistance by 10 percent.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.280
That should be enough.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.917
We can't afford to
be cavalier, Reg.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.858
lf these treatments
don't work,

14:55.928 --> 14:58.055
the crew will
wind up liquefied.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.859
You're forgetting
that the inoculations

14:59.932 --> 15:01.194
aren't designed to work alone.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.165
They were intended
to work in combination

15:03.235 --> 15:05.135
with the shield modifications.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.968
lt's the medicinal ''ying''
to the shields' ''yang.''

15:08.040 --> 15:10.031
A-and what if the ''yang''
doesn't work?

15:10.142 --> 15:11.609
That's not going to happen.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.974
Now, listen,
Lieutenant Barclay

15:14.046 --> 15:16.879
has a special affinity
for this crew.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.439
So do l.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.883
l promise you,
we won't let them down.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.454
Of course you won't.

15:23.522 --> 15:24.887
Tell me...

15:24.957 --> 15:27.050
do you also share
Lieutenant Barclay's

15:27.126 --> 15:28.184
affinity for golf?

15:29.461 --> 15:31.088
We have identical handicaps.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.721
Well, if you're not busy later,

15:32.798 --> 15:35.358
perhaps we could play nine holes
on the holodeck.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.095
Eh, it's tempting,
but l still have

15:37.202 --> 15:39.534
a few dozen progress reports
to look over.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.799
Well, in that case,

15:40.906 --> 15:43.204
maybe you could
look over them here,

15:43.275 --> 15:46.039
so that l could borrow
the mobile emitter.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.375
Providing that the
rest of the day's work

15:48.447 --> 15:50.244
goes smoothly,
consider it yours.

15:51.850 --> 15:55.013
l... l thought it was mine.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.711
Commander Chakotay tells me

15:57.790 --> 15:59.690
that you finished repairing
the transceiver.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.919
We were just about to send
the Captain's reply

16:02.027 --> 16:03.085
to Lieutenant Barclay.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.186
Do you have enough room

16:04.263 --> 16:06.060
to include a progress
report from me?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.497
l think we can
squeeze that in.

16:08.600 --> 16:13.503
Computer, download
Barclay Hologram File 01

16:13.572 --> 16:15.631
to the data block.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.732
Download complete.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.572
Transmitting.

16:47.072 --> 16:50.337
lt's about time.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.469
Greetings from
the Delta Quadrant, Lieutenant.

16:53.545 --> 16:54.512
You'll be happy to know

16:54.580 --> 16:56.445
that your hologram
reached us safely...

16:56.515 --> 16:58.540
Get to the important part.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.111
ln accordance with the
7 4th Rule of Acquisition--

17:04.189 --> 17:05.247
''Knowledge Equals Profit''

17:05.324 --> 17:08.487
l've enclosed the specifications
you've requested.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.391
See you soon.

17:10.462 --> 17:13.829
Oh, look at
those hands.

17:13.932 --> 17:16.093
l bet she gives
great oo-mox.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.260
Too bad she'll be dead
when she gets here.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.838
Forget the hands.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.601
Show me the nanoprobes.

17:26.011 --> 17:27.842
How many are there?

17:27.913 --> 17:29.505
3.6 million.

17:29.581 --> 17:33.142
That's 20 percent more
than we predicted.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.708
3.6 million nanoprobes

17:34.787 --> 17:37.085
at six bars of latinum per unit.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.316
Uh, that comes to...

17:38.390 --> 17:41.848
More profit than
we ever dreamed of.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.086
Your drink, sir.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.313
Thank you.

18:09.388 --> 18:11.356
Thank you.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.993
Something to drink, ma'am?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.568
l'm fine, thanks.

18:23.635 --> 18:24.795
Are you sure?

18:24.903 --> 18:26.461
l've got
a chocolate passion punch

18:26.572 --> 18:27.766
with your name on it.

18:28.974 --> 18:30.373
Reg?

18:30.442 --> 18:31.966
Surprise.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.808
Where's Commander Riker?

18:35.881 --> 18:37.746
He doesn't arrive until Friday.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.078
Oh.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.142
The question is:
What are you doing here?

18:41.220 --> 18:42.983
Just had some time off.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.888
Your letter
made this place sound fun,

18:45.991 --> 18:48.016
and just thought l'd join you.

18:48.093 --> 18:50.891
Do you have any idea
how inappropriate it is

18:50.963 --> 18:53.329
to follow your therapist
on vacation?

18:53.398 --> 18:54.422
Please.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.025
They might be watching.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.433
Who?

18:58.537 --> 19:00.732
The Borg, the Romulans.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.398
l'm not sure yet.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.237
Please...

19:04.309 --> 19:07.608
Deanna, l need your help.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.247
Commander Harkins is usually
willing to hear me out,

19:12.317 --> 19:14.751
but this time, he wouldn't
even look at my evidence.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.687
l'm not sure any of this
qualifies as evidence, Reg.

19:17.756 --> 19:19.815
You don't believe me, either.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.120
You think l'm imagining this?

19:22.194 --> 19:23.388
Just like Pete?

19:25.264 --> 19:27.323
The last time l saw you,

19:27.399 --> 19:30.960
you were laughing,
telling jokes.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.627
You even sang
a duet with Data.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.540
That was Commander La Forge's
birthday party.

19:37.609 --> 19:41.443
You were a completely
different Reg that night.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.844
Oh. Things were better then.

19:42.915 --> 19:43.882
How?

19:43.982 --> 19:45.040
Well, for one thing

19:45.117 --> 19:46.675
l had just finished the matrix

19:46.752 --> 19:48.117
for my hologram,

19:48.187 --> 19:50.849
and l showed Geordi
some of the specs that night.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.686
He said he was proud of me.

19:52.758 --> 19:53.884
What else?

19:54.026 --> 19:58.122
Oh... the Dragons had
just won the pennant,

19:58.197 --> 19:59.664
and l was

19:59.731 --> 20:02.894
still seeing Leosa.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.626
You mentioned her at the party.

20:04.736 --> 20:06.101
A teacher, right?

20:06.171 --> 20:07.399
Everything was going

20:07.506 --> 20:11.909
so well-- my job,
my personal life.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.774
l started to think

20:13.845 --> 20:15.938
maybe my luck was changing.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.276
And then you lost your hologram.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.317
Admiral Paris was furious.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.857
He said we'd, we'd wasted
a transmission to Voyager.

20:26.925 --> 20:29.416
Pete talked him into
giving us another chance,

20:29.494 --> 20:31.758
but there was so much
pressure after that.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.923
Did it put a strain
on your relationship

20:33.999 --> 20:35.193
with Leosa?

20:35.300 --> 20:36.324
She left me.

20:36.435 --> 20:37.333
Oh, l'm sorry.

20:37.436 --> 20:38.562
l went to her apartment.

20:38.670 --> 20:39.796
She was gone.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.169
There was no furniture,
no forwarding address,

20:42.241 --> 20:43.708
not even a
''Dear Reg'' letter.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.277
That must have been
very upsetting.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.006
Mmm. lt's just
my luck, right?

20:48.146 --> 20:50.341
Lose the hologram
and the girl.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.677
Tell me more

20:51.750 --> 20:53.377
about Leosa.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.010
Oh. You would have liked her.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.816
She was sweet,
she was thoughtful

20:57.889 --> 20:59.857
and such
a wonderful listener.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.950
She would let me,
let me go on for hours.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.292
What did you
talk about?

21:05.364 --> 21:09.130
Oh. She was fascinated
by my work at Pathfinder

21:09.234 --> 21:11.225
and, uh...

21:11.336 --> 21:13.304
she didn't, uh...

21:14.473 --> 21:17.874
she didn't find
any of it boring.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.470
She made me feel interesting.

21:21.546 --> 21:24.606
What do you feel when
we talk about her now?

21:24.683 --> 21:29.347
Um, sadness, l suppose.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.653
A little confusion.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.249
l'm sensing something else...

21:36.795 --> 21:38.387
something beneath
the surface.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.623
What?

21:39.698 --> 21:41.791
l think you might
be sensing it, too.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.061
What?

21:43.168 --> 21:45.728
Suspicion, Reg.

21:45.837 --> 21:46.929
You suspect her of something.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.006
l suspect

21:48.106 --> 21:49.869
that she's happier without me,

21:49.941 --> 21:51.408
if that's what you mean.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.104
You think
Leosa had something to do

21:54.179 --> 21:56.477
with your disappearing hologram,

21:56.548 --> 21:59.016
but you can't bring yourself
to admit it.

21:59.117 --> 22:02.518
That's why you're projecting
your suspicions onto others.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.316
You're in denial.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.884
lf there's any chance

22:07.993 --> 22:11.429
Leosa did breach
Pathfinder security,

22:11.496 --> 22:14.488
you need to tell
your superiors.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.830
l-l'd be humiliated... again.

22:18.637 --> 22:19.865
l'll go with you.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.269
What about your vacation?

22:22.341 --> 22:25.902
l'll be back here
before Will arrives.

22:25.977 --> 22:31.745
Do you really think
it's possible that Leosa

22:31.817 --> 22:33.944
stole my hologram?

22:34.052 --> 22:36.520
Why would she do that?

22:38.190 --> 22:40.954
Maybe... maybe she wanted

22:41.093 --> 22:44.460
something to remember me by.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.724
Captain's Log, supplemental.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.426
With the help
of the Barclay hologram,

22:49.534 --> 22:53.061
we've nearly completed
the modifications to Voyager.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.139
As for Reg, he's becoming

22:55.207 --> 22:57.505
extremely popular with the crew.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.373
lmagine my disappointment

22:59.444 --> 23:01.071
when l discovered
that Lieutenant Paris

23:01.179 --> 23:03.272
had eaten
all the scrambled eggs.

23:04.683 --> 23:07.243
lt was pure,
unadulterated gluttony,

23:07.319 --> 23:10.516
gastronomic conduct
unbecoming a Starfleet officer.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.580
He knows
it's my favorite breakfast,

23:12.657 --> 23:14.022
but he ate them anyway.

23:14.092 --> 23:16.754
We have
an egg-mergency here, people.

23:16.828 --> 23:20.093
l want to know
what you plan to do about it.

23:20.165 --> 23:23.623
Maybe l can replicate
some more, Captain.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.464
Do it.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.276
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

23:32.377 --> 23:34.106
He's not only programmed
to get us home,

23:34.179 --> 23:35.510
he does impressions.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.741
You see, it's always bothered
Lieutenant Barclay

23:37.816 --> 23:39.716
that he was uncomfortable
in large groups.

23:39.785 --> 23:43.744
So he designed me
to be the life of the party.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.083
l hope he's not too shy.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.785
He's going to have
150 new friends

23:47.859 --> 23:48.917
when we get back home.

23:48.994 --> 23:52.327
lf we get home, Harry, if.

23:52.397 --> 23:53.591
Pardon my friend here.

23:53.665 --> 23:55.223
He's convinced we're destined

23:55.300 --> 23:57.700
to live out our days
in the Delta Quadrant.

23:57.803 --> 24:00.101
Your pessimism is illogical.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.140
Perhaps a mind-meld
would help to alleviate

24:02.240 --> 24:03.172
your concern.

24:04.476 --> 24:06.876
Sick Bay to Reg.

24:06.978 --> 24:09.242
Please report to Holodeck 2.

24:09.314 --> 24:10.303
On my way.

24:16.755 --> 24:20.054
l was starting to think
you'd forgotten our tee time.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.217
So, what'll it be?

24:21.293 --> 24:22.726
Pebble Beach at sunset?

24:22.794 --> 24:24.557
The back nine at Gedi Prime?

24:24.629 --> 24:25.789
Actually, Doctor...

24:25.864 --> 24:27.729
l'm afraid something's come up.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.131
l'm going to meet
with Seven of Nine.

24:30.235 --> 24:31.862
Oh, really?

24:31.970 --> 24:33.904
She's going to teach me
to play Kadis-Kot.

24:33.972 --> 24:34.939
Uh, Reg...

24:35.040 --> 24:36.507
when l agreed
to lend you my emitter,

24:36.575 --> 24:37.837
l did it
with the understanding

24:37.909 --> 24:40.241
that you needed it
for official business.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.609
What's your point?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.045
My point is that board games

24:43.114 --> 24:45.082
aren't exactly crucial
to your mission.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.881
And l suppose golf is?

24:48.954 --> 24:51.354
Reg...

24:54.159 --> 24:55.319
l'll tell you what.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.054
When we get back home,

24:57.128 --> 24:59.824
we'll play as much
golf as you like.

24:59.898 --> 25:02.264
Until then, let's
try to keep out

25:02.367 --> 25:03.959
of each other's hair.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.229
What do you say?

25:12.644 --> 25:14.168
State your name for the record.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.407
Leosa.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.312
L-e-o

25:18.383 --> 25:19.873
s-a.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.417
Occupation?

25:21.486 --> 25:23.249
Dabo girl.

25:23.321 --> 25:24.253
Dabo?

25:24.322 --> 25:25.653
lt's a Ferengi game.

25:25.724 --> 25:28.716
l work aboard
one of their casino ships.

25:28.793 --> 25:31.125
You, you told me
you were a teacher.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.892
ls this true?

25:34.032 --> 25:36.466
Sometimes l'm a teacher.

25:36.568 --> 25:38.035
Sometimes l'm a Bajoran vedek.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.638
Whatever the customer wants.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.174
Lieutenant Barclay tells me
that the two of you

25:44.276 --> 25:46.904
have spent a significant amount
of time together.

25:46.978 --> 25:49.776
Did he ever discuss his work
at Pathfinder with you?

25:49.848 --> 25:52.544
Oh. Wouldn't talk
about anything else.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.177
lt was always holograms this

25:55.253 --> 25:57.653
and cyclic pulsars that.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.316
And who did you share
that information with?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.656
Nobody.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.594
l have a theory.

26:05.664 --> 26:07.655
Would you like to hear it?

26:07.732 --> 26:10.599
Why not?

26:10.702 --> 26:12.260
l think that some
of your Ferengi friends

26:12.370 --> 26:14.497
found a way to profit
from Lieutenant Barclay's work.

26:14.606 --> 26:16.540
l think

26:16.608 --> 26:18.769
you were encouraged

26:18.843 --> 26:20.401
to get close to him,

26:20.478 --> 26:24.380
and when you had all
the information you needed,

26:24.449 --> 26:25.507
you left him.

26:25.584 --> 26:29.350
l left Reg
for one simple reason.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.218
He's boring.

26:37.028 --> 26:40.725
Don't tell me you never noticed.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.029
With the Admiral's permission,

26:43.134 --> 26:44.897
l'd like a moment alone

26:45.070 --> 26:46.435
with Leosa.

26:46.504 --> 26:48.404
l don't think therapy

26:48.473 --> 26:50.441
is what this woman needs,
Counselor.

26:50.508 --> 26:52.373
Five minutes, Admiral.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.641
Five minutes.

27:12.931 --> 27:16.059
Did you know l'm a Betazoid?

27:16.167 --> 27:17.634
l'm empathic,

27:17.736 --> 27:21.297
which means l know
when people are lying.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.738
Tell me, what's the longest

27:23.808 --> 27:26.470
you've ever been
incarcerated?

27:29.080 --> 27:31.776
You can't send me
to prison, Counselor.

27:31.850 --> 27:33.750
l didn't do anything wrong.

27:33.818 --> 27:37.185
Maybe not, but l can order you

27:37.255 --> 27:40.850
held for psychiatric
observation.

27:40.925 --> 27:43.393
Extended observation.

27:43.461 --> 27:46.555
l may not be a Betazoid

27:46.631 --> 27:48.758
but l work a dabo table,

27:48.833 --> 27:51.859
and l know
when somebody's bluffing.

27:55.707 --> 27:57.265
Try me.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.816
You were correct, Admiral.

28:07.919 --> 28:11.082
The Ferengi did steal
Reg's hologram-- twice.

28:11.156 --> 28:12.282
This is the ship

28:12.357 --> 28:13.915
you need to look for.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.765
That's it.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.031
That's Nunk's ship.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.207
Nunk?

28:32.277 --> 28:35.371
My... employer.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.244
Scans indicate they've been
in the vicinity

28:37.315 --> 28:39.875
of that star
for the last 43 hours.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.543
Why?

28:41.619 --> 28:43.177
l don't know.

28:43.254 --> 28:45.518
She's telling the truth...

28:45.590 --> 28:47.148
for once.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.715
The Ferengi wouldn't
have stolen the hologram

28:48.793 --> 28:50.385
if they didn't think
it was valuable.

28:50.462 --> 28:54.330
They're probably waiting
to rendezvous with a buyer.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.027
Are there any Starfleet ships
in that area?

28:57.135 --> 28:59.330
The Carolina is
.7 light-years away.

28:59.437 --> 29:00.301
At maximum warp,

29:00.405 --> 29:01.565
it could reach them
in two hours.

29:01.639 --> 29:03.038
Open a channel.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.610
Computer, open a secure channel
to the Carolina.

29:07.679 --> 29:11.445
Tell Captain Peterson to adjust
his course immediately.

29:15.019 --> 29:18.819
Was everything that happened
between us a lie?

29:18.923 --> 29:20.254
Not everything.

29:20.325 --> 29:23.658
Just the parts where l
expressed affection for you.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.561
Oh...

29:27.632 --> 29:30.123
if it makes any difference,

29:30.201 --> 29:31.930
it wasn't personal.

29:32.036 --> 29:34.436
lt was just... business.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.475
What exactly is a broken heart
worth these days, hmm?

29:38.576 --> 29:41.773
Ten percent.

29:41.846 --> 29:42.835
Of what?

29:42.914 --> 29:45.883
Profits from the nanoprobes.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.144
Nanoprobes?

29:47.218 --> 29:48.344
Mm-hmm.

29:48.419 --> 29:49.647
Borg nanoprobes?

29:49.721 --> 29:51.018
Yeah.

29:51.089 --> 29:52.716
Gegis says they're worth

29:52.791 --> 29:55.157
two billion times
their weight in latinum.

29:55.226 --> 29:57.660
Oh.

30:04.002 --> 30:04.900
l don't think

30:05.003 --> 30:06.436
l quite understand
the problem, Doctor.

30:06.504 --> 30:07.562
Are you aware

30:07.672 --> 30:09.230
that he's been doing
impressions of you?

30:09.340 --> 30:11.274
You should hear his
Tuvok-- it's eerie.

30:11.342 --> 30:12.775
lt's disrespectful.

30:12.844 --> 30:14.607
What do you want me
to do, deactivate him?

30:14.679 --> 30:16.772
Just long enough to run
a diagnostic of his program.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.110
His recent behavior

30:18.183 --> 30:19.844
may be indicative
of a more serious problem.

30:19.918 --> 30:21.476
l haven't seen
any evidence of that.

30:21.553 --> 30:22.485
Of course not.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.954
ln front of you,
he's all smiles...

30:25.023 --> 30:29.551
but l've seen him
be rude and careless--

30:29.627 --> 30:31.959
two traits the real
Lieutenant Barclay

30:32.030 --> 30:33.292
never exhibited.

30:33.364 --> 30:35.389
l know the real Barclay
is a friend of yours,

30:35.466 --> 30:37.229
and l'm sorry
if the holographic version

30:37.335 --> 30:39.132
hasn't lived up
to your expectations,

30:39.237 --> 30:41.364
but that's hardly reason
to deactivate him.

30:41.472 --> 30:44.305
Are the lives of 150 crewmen
reason enough?

30:44.375 --> 30:45.672
Maybe you're right.

30:45.743 --> 30:47.506
Maybe l am overreacting,

30:47.579 --> 30:49.308
but what if l'm right?

30:49.380 --> 30:51.974
We're less than
a light-year away

30:52.050 --> 30:54.610
from the geodesic fold.

30:54.686 --> 30:58.178
Do you want to risk
being led through it

30:58.256 --> 31:00.554
by a malfunctioning hologram?

31:01.626 --> 31:03.389
Captain, you saved us
a com call.

31:03.461 --> 31:06.055
We're ready to bring the
enhanced shielding on line.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.563
Good work.

31:07.632 --> 31:10.066
l need a moment alone with Reg.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.102
Your program has been running
continuously

31:12.170 --> 31:13.603
for how many hours now?

31:13.671 --> 31:16.731
56 hours, 1 1 minutes
and 21 seconds.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.604
l'd like to run a
diagnostic of your matrix,

31:18.676 --> 31:20.644
make sure you haven't
suffered any degradation

31:20.712 --> 31:23.272
over the last few days.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.145
This isn't the, uh...

31:25.216 --> 31:26.945
Doctor's idea, is it?

31:27.085 --> 31:31.146
He expressed some concern
for your well-being, yes.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.951
l bet he did.

31:33.091 --> 31:34.524
Believe me, Reg, the crew and l

31:34.592 --> 31:36.253
are grateful
for everything you've done,

31:36.327 --> 31:37.954
but we need to take
every precaution.

31:38.029 --> 31:39.360
l understand perfectly.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.625
And if the ship's Doctor thinks

31:41.699 --> 31:44.133
l need a checkup,
who am l to argue?

32:03.288 --> 32:05.415
Why are you hiding
in the corner?

32:05.490 --> 32:07.481
l'm not hiding.

32:07.558 --> 32:11.324
l'm working on a way
to foil the Ferengi's plans.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.387
Reg, there's nothing
left to foil.

32:13.464 --> 32:16.126
The Carolina will have them
in custody within the hour.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.168
Leosa said the Ferengi

32:18.236 --> 32:21.535
were going to be selling
Borg nanoprobes.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.440
What does that have to do
with Voyager?.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.137
They have a Borg crewman.

32:27.211 --> 32:28.803
Think about it.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.213
The Ferengi stole the original
Barclay hologram a month ago.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.410
That gave them time
to reprogram it

32:34.485 --> 32:36.476
and then smuggle it to Voyager

32:36.554 --> 32:37.953
in the next transmission.

32:38.056 --> 32:39.717
Reprogram it to do what?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.954
Steal Seven of Nine's
nanoprobes.

32:43.094 --> 32:45.892
For all we know, he could be

32:45.964 --> 32:48.296
dissecting her right now.

32:48.366 --> 32:52.393
What would the Ferengi want
with assimilation technology?

32:52.503 --> 32:55.097
Oh, nanoprobes aren't just
for assimilating.

32:55.206 --> 32:57.436
They can reanimate
necrotic tissue,

32:57.508 --> 32:59.567
slow down the aging process.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.044
They'd be priceless
for the Ferengi.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.307
Reg, even if the Ferengi

33:04.349 --> 33:08.513
did reprogram your hologram
to steal the nanoprobes,

33:08.586 --> 33:11.783
how would they get
their hands on them?

33:11.856 --> 33:14.689
Voyager's
30,000 light-years away.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.853
l haven't figured
that part out yet.

33:17.929 --> 33:22.491
Maybe they discovered a, a
wormhole or a subspace corridor.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.532
Have you mentioned any of this
to Commander Harkins?

33:27.638 --> 33:29.572
Not yet. l can't.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.609
lf l don't bring him
hard evidence,

33:32.677 --> 33:35.942
he'll just think
that l'm fantasizing.

33:36.080 --> 33:40.744
For the time being, we need
to keep this between us.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.726
That tickles, Lieutenant.

33:50.795 --> 33:53.491
Sorry, Reg,
we're almost finished.

33:53.564 --> 33:55.464
Have you identified
any problems yet?

33:55.533 --> 33:57.228
l've gone over
his entire matrix.

33:57.335 --> 33:59.565
He's working perfectly.

33:59.670 --> 34:03.162
Maybe l'm not the one
who needs a diagnostic, hmm?

34:03.274 --> 34:06.710
l'm a big enough hologram
to admit when l'm wrong.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.803
l'm sorry l doubted you.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.041
Well, if anyone is owed
an apology, it's you.

34:11.114 --> 34:12.980
l should've been more sensitive.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.484
Friends?

34:14.552 --> 34:16.452
Friends.

34:16.521 --> 34:18.614
Now that that's out of the way,
Captain, what do you say

34:18.688 --> 34:20.246
we get this ship
back to Earth?

34:26.898 --> 34:28.388
lt's time.

34:28.466 --> 34:31.594
lnitiate the geodesic pulse.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.342
Would someone care to tell me

34:47.418 --> 34:49.248
what that is?

34:56.293 --> 34:58.387
lt's a geodesic fold, Admiral.

34:58.463 --> 35:01.523
That's how they're going
to get the nanoprobes.

35:03.901 --> 35:06.335
Two million kilometers

35:06.404 --> 35:07.871
and closing, Captain.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.406
Take us to one-quarter impulse.

35:09.474 --> 35:10.873
Bridge to Astrometrics.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.773
Bring the enhanced
shielding on line.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.004
Aye, Commander.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.404
What's wrong?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.044
The fold contains
three radiation types

35:22.120 --> 35:23.678
we didn't account for.

35:23.754 --> 35:25.381
The shield modifications
are not enough.

35:25.456 --> 35:26.718
Well, the shields were modified

35:26.791 --> 35:28.725
to work in combination
with the inoculations.

35:28.793 --> 35:29.885
We'll be fine.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.223
lf the shields fail,

35:31.295 --> 35:32.694
the inoculations
will be irrelevant.

35:32.763 --> 35:33.991
Astrometrics to the Bridge.

35:34.065 --> 35:34.827
Go ahead.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.537
What is it, Seven?

35:40.605 --> 35:44.336
There was a problem, Captain,

35:44.408 --> 35:46.433
but l've corrected it.

35:54.585 --> 35:58.214
l'm using the MlDAS Array to tap
into the Ferengi ship's sensors.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.723
They're receiving telemetry
through the fold.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.850
lf l'm reading this correctly,
Voyager's headed right for it.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.188
Captain Janeway knows better

36:04.262 --> 36:05.229
than to take her ship

36:05.296 --> 36:06.661
into such a dangerous anomaly.

36:06.731 --> 36:10.258
lf the Ferengi did alter
my hologram, then...

36:10.368 --> 36:12.131
it might... might be possible

36:12.236 --> 36:14.534
for him to have taken over
the ship.

36:14.605 --> 36:16.698
One hologram
against an entire crew?

36:16.807 --> 36:19.139
He may have found a way
to incapacitate the crew

36:19.210 --> 36:20.871
or to commandeer
the ship's systems,

36:21.012 --> 36:23.139
but either way, we've
got to get the Carolina

36:23.214 --> 36:24.203
to close the fold.

36:24.282 --> 36:26.216
The Carolina isn't
equipped to do that.

36:26.284 --> 36:27.876
Then they'll have to commandeer
the Ferengi ship

36:27.952 --> 36:28.884
and do it from there.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.011
The Carolina's still

36:30.087 --> 36:31.748
half a light-year away.
They won't make it in time.

36:31.822 --> 36:35.314
Can we transmit a message,
warn Voyager?.

36:35.393 --> 36:38.385
Not through a geodesic fold.

36:44.535 --> 36:49.404
Our own starship,
with multiphasic shielding

36:49.473 --> 36:53.170
and a gold-pressed
latinum hull.

36:53.244 --> 36:55.940
We'll have enough left over
to buy a fleet of casino ships!

36:56.080 --> 37:00.073
l have a better idea--
lobe enlargements!

37:02.220 --> 37:03.448
Shh!

37:03.521 --> 37:04.681
Ooh, someone's
hailing us.

37:04.755 --> 37:06.188
Who?

37:06.257 --> 37:08.418
l can't tell.
There's too much interference.

37:08.492 --> 37:09.789
Answer it.

37:12.697 --> 37:13.959
lt's the hologram.

37:14.031 --> 37:15.293
You said it was impossible

37:15.366 --> 37:17.300
to communicate
through the fold.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.868
l thought it was.

37:18.936 --> 37:20.801
l guess l did a better job

37:20.871 --> 37:23.237
of reprogramming the hologram
than l thought.

37:24.342 --> 37:25.366
We must close

37:25.476 --> 37:28.468
the geodesic fold immediately.

37:28.546 --> 37:30.980
Captain Janeway has
found out about our plan.

37:31.048 --> 37:32.515
lf that's true,

37:32.583 --> 37:35.484
then why is she still
headed for the fold?

37:35.553 --> 37:37.544
Because she...

37:37.622 --> 37:40.887
found a way
to protect her ship.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.118
lmpossible.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.854
You don't know Janeway.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.795
She's uncanny
when it comes to shields.

37:46.864 --> 37:48.263
She's furious.

37:48.332 --> 37:50.800
She said she was going to kill

37:50.901 --> 37:53.563
whoever tried to harm her crew.

37:53.671 --> 37:56.640
l strongly suggest
you abort the mission.

37:56.741 --> 37:58.766
What should we do?

37:58.876 --> 38:01.470
Go to warp before Janeway
makes it through.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.774
No, you mustn't!

38:03.814 --> 38:05.213
Voyager has
Borg interquadrental

38:05.283 --> 38:09.617
warp drives and...
Hirogen hunting sensors

38:09.687 --> 38:11.655
and Vidiian phase torpedoes.

38:11.722 --> 38:14.452
No matter where you run,
Voyager will find you.

38:14.525 --> 38:19.189
Your only hope...
is to close the fold.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.799
Harkins to Holodeck 1.

38:29.907 --> 38:31.465
Go ahead, Pete.

38:31.575 --> 38:33.770
lt worked, Reg.

38:33.844 --> 38:35.675
They've started
to close the fold.

38:35.746 --> 38:37.373
Computer, end program.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.510
Something's wrong, Captain.

38:43.587 --> 38:45.748
Astrometrics to the Bridge.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.313
Why are we stopping?

38:47.391 --> 38:49.655
The fold's collapsing, Reg.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.217
We didn't make it in time.

38:51.295 --> 38:53.661
lt's not too late
if we remodulate the shields.

38:53.731 --> 38:56.291
l appreciate your determination,
but we can't risk it.

38:56.367 --> 38:57.925
You did everything you could.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.904
Captain, someone just initiated

39:01.939 --> 39:03.406
a site-to-site transport.

39:03.441 --> 39:04.408
Who?

39:04.475 --> 39:05.942
Seven and Reg.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.238
They've beamed
to an escape pod.

39:07.311 --> 39:09.541
Bridge to Seven of Nine.
What's going on?

39:13.617 --> 39:14.584
The pod's been launched.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.176
Put a tractor beam on it.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.824
There is too much interference
from the fold.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.823
Harry, can you get
a transporter lock?

39:26.030 --> 39:27.463
What now?

39:27.531 --> 39:29.396
There's something coming
through the fold.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.399
Voyager?.

39:30.501 --> 39:31.832
No, it's too small.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.028
A phase torpedo!

39:33.137 --> 39:34.627
Raise shields!

39:34.739 --> 39:36.673
Brace for impact!

39:43.247 --> 39:44.908
lt's an escape pod.

39:50.121 --> 39:54.387
Maybe the hologram
sent us the drone.

39:54.458 --> 39:55.891
Ooh...!

39:55.960 --> 39:57.825
Check what's in there.

39:59.263 --> 40:01.390
Nothing.

40:01.465 --> 40:06.402
No Borg corpse, no nanoprobes.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.665
No profit.

40:12.176 --> 40:14.371
Captain's Log, supplemental.

40:14.445 --> 40:16.675
Seven of Nine
has recovered from her injuries

40:16.747 --> 40:18.942
and ''Reg'' has been deactivated.

40:19.016 --> 40:21.314
Until we finish
analyzing his program,

40:21.385 --> 40:23.785
his motivations
remain a mystery.

40:30.127 --> 40:32.652
Making first contact

40:32.730 --> 40:33.924
with a new life-form?

40:33.998 --> 40:35.397
''Mom's apple pie.''

40:35.466 --> 40:38.094
Neelix thought
a little home cooking

40:38.202 --> 40:39.134
might cheer me up.

40:39.203 --> 40:39.965
And...?

40:40.104 --> 40:41.799
l haven't worked up the courage

40:41.906 --> 40:42.873
to taste it yet.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.465
Have you figured out
what went wrong with Reg?

40:45.576 --> 40:48.909
Well, Seven thinks our proximity
to the fold degraded his matrix,

40:48.979 --> 40:51.174
but if you ask me,
it was a recursive error

40:51.248 --> 40:52.579
in his logic subroutine.

40:58.556 --> 41:00.114
Not bad...

41:00.224 --> 41:03.421
but it would have tasted better
in San Francisco.

41:06.330 --> 41:08.821
lf it'll make you
feel any better,

41:08.899 --> 41:12.062
l'll let you in
on a little secret.

41:12.169 --> 41:14.194
l was on the Bridge
this morning

41:14.305 --> 41:17.035
when we received a hail
from an lconian scientist.

41:17.107 --> 41:20.338
He claims to have a
transdimensional gateway

41:20.411 --> 41:22.606
that can take us
anywhere in the galaxy.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.911
l'm not that gullible.

41:25.983 --> 41:28.213
lt's true. l was there.

41:28.285 --> 41:29.684
The Captain doesn't want us

41:29.753 --> 41:31.311
to get our hopes up,

41:31.388 --> 41:34.084
but personally, l think we'll
be home by the end of the week.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.851
Are you serious?

41:40.297 --> 41:42.697
You were right about him.

41:49.707 --> 41:54.406
Computer, install Barclay
Security Protocol 21-Alpha.

41:54.478 --> 41:57.242
lnstallation complete.

41:57.314 --> 42:00.112
ldentify yourself.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.812
C-computer, deactivate
Barclay program.

42:04.288 --> 42:05.619
l'm sorry.

42:05.689 --> 42:06.883
l... l've been programming him

42:06.991 --> 42:08.982
with new security
precautions

42:09.059 --> 42:10.617
s-so he can't be stolen again.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.491
You seem to be off
to a good start.

42:12.563 --> 42:14.497
l thought you'd, uh,
be back at the beach.

42:14.565 --> 42:16.692
Will and l decided
to spend the rest

42:16.767 --> 42:18.428
of our vacation in Tiburon.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.468
We were wondering

42:19.537 --> 42:20.765
if you're free
for dinner tonight.

42:20.871 --> 42:23.271
Uh, l, oh...

42:23.340 --> 42:26.503
Oh, l, uh, l-l wouldn't want
to be a ''third nacelle.''

42:26.577 --> 42:27.669
Not possible.

42:27.745 --> 42:30.509
Will's bringing
a friend for you.

42:30.581 --> 42:32.310
Her name's Maril.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.248
You're going to adore her.

42:34.318 --> 42:37.685
l'd like to,
but l-l still have, uh...

42:37.755 --> 42:40.189
dozens of protocols to install.

42:40.257 --> 42:41.690
Maybe next time.

42:41.759 --> 42:44.284
Look, Reg,
l know Leosa hurt you,

42:44.361 --> 42:47.922
but hiding inside a hologrid
isn't the answer.

42:47.998 --> 42:51.161
You need to get out,
meet new people.

42:51.268 --> 42:54.465
This Maril wouldn't happen
to be a dabo girl

42:54.572 --> 42:55.903
by any chance?

42:55.973 --> 42:58.635
She's a teacher, actually--
a real one.

42:58.709 --> 42:59.698
Are you sure?

42:59.810 --> 43:00.834
Don't worry, Reg.

43:00.945 --> 43:04.073
We've taken
security precautions.
