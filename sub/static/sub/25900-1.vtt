00:24.481 --> 00:28.521
(rhythmic and pleasant
folk rock music)

00:35.000 --> 00:35.840
- What are you doing?

00:35.880 --> 00:37.281
- Yes, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:37.321 --> 00:38.280
Wait!

00:40.960 --> 00:41.681
- Can I open them yet?

00:41.720 --> 00:42.681
- Yes.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.720
(both chuckling over waiter
speaking foreign language)

00:49.360 --> 00:50.320
Cheers.

00:52.040 --> 00:52.920
- Cheers.
(glasses clinking)

00:52.960 --> 00:56.560

look so young in these.

02:09.478 --> 02:11.198
Why are you up so early?

02:11.238 --> 02:13.118
- I'm off to Katelyn.

02:13.158 --> 02:15.398
She's such a darling,
but remodeling her house

02:15.438 --> 02:17.358
will take longer
than reconstruction.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.958
- [Dennis] Ooh, this one's
before Mexico, Jesus Christ!

02:19.998 --> 02:22.558
That's my birthday, that's
incredible, look at that!

02:22.598 --> 02:24.438
- You know where I'd
like to go with you?

02:24.478 --> 02:28.197
(sighs) You remember Mexico?

02:28.238 --> 02:31.197
Chichen Itza, that,
uh, El Castillo,

02:31.238 --> 02:32.518
that pyramid in the middle.

02:32.557 --> 02:33.797
- [Dennis] Yeah.

02:33.838 --> 02:37.077
- Yeah, that's where I'd
like to celebrate with you.

02:37.117 --> 02:41.158
Us standing up there,
the sunlight going down.

02:41.637 --> 02:42.597
Beautiful!

02:44.357 --> 02:45.317
Like it?

02:46.437 --> 02:50.077
There is so much work
to do, you have no idea!

02:53.197 --> 02:55.637
I'll be back for the party.

02:55.677 --> 02:56.917
In time, promise!

02:56.957 --> 02:59.917
(footsteps clacking)

03:09.316 --> 03:11.916
(water bubbling)

03:13.397 --> 03:17.436
(rhythmic acoustic guitar
music with pleasant vocals)

03:39.596 --> 03:41.036
(water splashing)

03:41.076 --> 03:45.115

pleasant ambient music)

04:00.596 --> 04:04.354
(water splashing and bubbling)

04:17.274 --> 04:18.995
(water splashing)

04:19.035 --> 04:20.154
- [Partygoer] Hey,
hey, I'll tell you

04:20.195 --> 04:22.435
what I told Travolta,
not in the face!

04:22.475 --> 04:24.875
- Nobody drinks anymore,
it's all about G.

04:24.915 --> 04:26.155
- Yeah, but like, can't you die?

04:26.195 --> 04:27.514
- Only if you do too much.

04:27.555 --> 04:28.954
- Happy birthday!
(slap cracking)

04:28.994 --> 04:30.394
- [Partygoer] Henry!

04:30.435 --> 04:34.475
(partygoers chattering
over throbbing EDM music)

04:35.874 --> 04:37.715
- Hey, hey, uh, Dennis.

04:39.994 --> 04:42.115
- (gasps) All I can taste is
whiskey, where's the sour?

04:42.155 --> 04:43.635
- Right, you know
how Daddy likes it,

04:47.594 --> 04:50.074
Dennis, careful, he's in a mood.

04:52.554 --> 04:54.075
I mean, remember last time?

04:54.114 --> 04:56.194
I'm not getting fired again!

04:57.434 --> 04:59.073
- High kick!
(Javi groans)

04:59.114 --> 05:01.794
- Ah, yeah, not now (sighs).

05:01.834 --> 05:02.834
You're good to go, thanks.

05:02.873 --> 05:04.394
- Well, the ratings
are down everywhere,

05:04.434 --> 05:06.634
I mean, the only thing that's
not going down on it is him.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.274
- Listen, we need a gimmick,
we need a sensation,

05:09.314 --> 05:10.713
something to trigger the show.

05:10.754 --> 05:12.353
Something to survive
the next season--

05:12.394 --> 05:13.913
- I've got a good idea,
have another angioplasty,

05:13.954 --> 05:15.434
or better yet, become
a transsexual--

05:15.474 --> 05:16.193
- Oh, stop!

05:16.234 --> 05:17.754
- No, no, seriously!

05:17.794 --> 05:19.393
- A brain tumor would get us
at least two more seasons.

05:19.434 --> 05:20.593
- [Farleigh] Guys, I'm serious.

05:20.634 --> 05:21.914
- [Tod] Get two
seasons out of that.

05:21.953 --> 05:25.594
- I'm in perfect health, I've
never been in better shape,

05:27.033 --> 05:28.553
'cause when I was sick, you
always stood at my side.

05:28.593 --> 05:31.113
That really showed
me that you loved me.

05:31.153 --> 05:32.433
- Yeah, but that's,
no, no no no.

05:32.474 --> 05:34.833
We, we, we care
about your health,

05:34.873 --> 05:36.832
and we have every
confidence in you,

05:36.873 --> 05:39.273
so why don't we just
take a moment and, uh,

05:39.313 --> 05:40.832
look at some of your new
sketches for the restaurants--

05:40.873 --> 05:42.033
- There isn't much to see, that,

05:42.073 --> 05:43.633
that's the fuckin'
problem (sighs).

05:43.673 --> 05:45.353
- Look, we design interiors,
not stunts for the show.

05:45.392 --> 05:46.233
That's your job.

05:46.273 --> 05:47.992
- Wh-what did you just say?

05:48.033 --> 05:49.593
We do?

05:49.633 --> 05:51.553
So we do wait for the
order of the next season,

05:51.592 --> 05:55.633
and we do pay for all your
nice and pretty things.

05:58.032 --> 05:59.671
- I'll get you
another whiskey sour.

05:59.712 --> 06:00.671
- Yes.

06:02.233 --> 06:03.192
Double!

06:04.192 --> 06:06.513
- You know, we could, uh, up
the flesh factor on the show.

06:06.552 --> 06:07.993
- [Michael] Hey!

06:08.032 --> 06:11.153
(throbbing EDM music)

06:11.192 --> 06:12.312
- What are you doing?

06:12.352 --> 06:13.353
- [Man In White Trunks] Eating.

06:13.392 --> 06:14.552
- Are you new or something?

06:14.593 --> 06:16.232
You don't eat in
front of gay people!

06:16.272 --> 06:18.632
I haven't had chips
since I came out!

06:18.672 --> 06:20.112
You're welcome.

06:20.152 --> 06:22.551
- No-no, you left a
drifter with crotch rot

06:22.592 --> 06:24.071
stick one in?

06:24.112 --> 06:26.232
- No, fucker, I didn't
know he was homeless, OK?

06:26.271 --> 06:28.992
I thought he was from Echo Park!

06:29.032 --> 06:29.951
- Wasn't there a smell?

06:29.992 --> 06:31.911
- No, he had really
nice shoes, OK?

06:31.952 --> 06:33.632
(man on left laughs)

06:33.671 --> 06:36.151
(bag crinkling)

06:45.432 --> 06:49.111
(vaguely ominous
electronic music)

06:56.951 --> 06:59.871
(water splashing)

06:59.911 --> 07:03.711
- How long have you
been standing there?

07:03.751 --> 07:06.391
Uh (clears throat).

07:17.791 --> 07:19.110
(partygoers laughing)

07:19.151 --> 07:22.390
(rhythmic funk music)

07:22.431 --> 07:23.270
(water splashing)

07:23.311 --> 07:26.190
(partygoers gasping and hooting)

07:26.230 --> 07:27.671
Farleigh, Farleigh?

07:29.591 --> 07:32.430
(rhythmic funk music)

07:36.310 --> 07:37.910
Hey, Farleigh!

07:37.950 --> 07:38.790
Farleigh!
(Farleigh groans)

07:38.830 --> 07:40.790
(glass clinking to floor)

07:40.830 --> 07:41.710
(Farleigh sighs)

07:41.750 --> 07:43.790
Thank God, you gave me a scare.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.990
(groans) I'm just
exhausted (groans).

07:49.030 --> 07:50.230
- [Dennis] Oh, come on!

07:50.270 --> 07:53.350
(rhythmic funk music)

07:56.990 --> 07:59.428
(Farleigh sighs)

07:59.470 --> 08:01.069
- You know, let's
just go to sleep,

08:01.110 --> 08:04.109
I, I have, I have a
really early morning, OK?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.909
(muffled funk music)

08:10.070 --> 08:11.549
- Church?

08:11.590 --> 08:13.069
- [Farleigh]
(chuckles) Yes, church.

08:13.109 --> 08:16.268
No, I'm serious, I
really should sleep.

08:18.908 --> 08:19.988
Good night.

08:20.029 --> 08:22.549
Uh, before I forget it, um,

08:22.588 --> 08:25.469
could you take the Porsche
tomorrow to a car wash?

08:25.509 --> 08:26.629
Thank you.

08:26.669 --> 08:28.988
- I just got it waxed
like a week ago.

08:29.028 --> 08:31.989
- [Farleigh] Yeah, but
it needs to look perfect.

08:32.029 --> 08:35.748
I got somebody who comes by
tomorrow to take a look at it.

08:35.789 --> 08:36.789
- Why?

08:38.749 --> 08:41.787
- (sighs) Because I
agreed to sell it,

08:41.828 --> 08:43.948
and I think I found a buyer.

08:43.988 --> 08:46.468
- [Dennis] Sell it, the Porsche?

08:47.629 --> 08:51.267
- I need to liquidate
some assets, Dennis.

08:51.308 --> 08:53.107
- But what will I drive?

08:53.149 --> 08:55.868
(muffled funk music)

09:01.308 --> 09:03.908
(Farleigh sighs)

09:05.668 --> 09:09.188
- Has it ever occurred
to you to get a job?

09:09.228 --> 09:10.188
- A job?

09:11.028 --> 09:12.587
- [Farleigh] Yeah.

09:12.628 --> 09:14.108
- You're joking.

09:14.147 --> 09:15.107
- No,

09:16.347 --> 09:17.307
no.

09:19.468 --> 09:23.507
(sighs) You live a very
costly lifestyle, my boy.

09:27.268 --> 09:29.188
- Like what kind of job?

09:29.987 --> 09:31.867
- Well, what are you good at,

09:31.907 --> 09:35.187
besides swilling champagne
and going to the gym?

09:35.227 --> 09:38.268
Which, by the way, it lately
seems you've been doing

09:38.307 --> 09:40.227
more of the former and
less of the latter.

09:40.267 --> 09:44.307
(distant partygoers laughing
over muffled funk music)

09:49.507 --> 09:51.866
Why does it have to be so loud?

09:52.987 --> 09:54.707
Can you turn on
the lights, please?

09:54.746 --> 09:57.306
(partygoers shouting)

09:57.347 --> 10:00.866
(pole cracking and rattling)

10:09.466 --> 10:12.027
(water bubbling)

10:14.226 --> 10:16.346
(Jasper sighs)

10:16.387 --> 10:19.346
(pleasant piano music)

10:22.386 --> 10:25.626
(water splashing)

10:25.666 --> 10:28.026
(Jasper gasps)

10:33.306 --> 10:36.706
(pleasant soft rock music)

10:36.746 --> 10:39.064
(Jasper gasps)

10:42.466 --> 10:46.426
(melody jingling from cellphone)

10:48.746 --> 10:50.225
- [Paulette] Meet
me in the War Room

10:50.266 --> 10:53.546
in a half an hour and
bring me a Xanax or five.

10:54.185 --> 10:56.345
(cellphone beeps)

10:56.385 --> 10:59.346
- Spanker of the
House again or wife?

10:59.385 --> 11:00.585
- The missus has been so good

11:00.625 --> 11:01.825
about staying out
of the picture,

11:01.865 --> 11:04.545
well, she decided to
steal my congressman back.

11:04.585 --> 11:06.265
- How is she
planning to do this?

11:06.305 --> 11:07.385
- Convince him to run
for a second term.

11:07.425 --> 11:09.225
- What, they live
up in Pasadena.

11:09.265 --> 11:10.345
- Well, she wants him
back in Washington

11:10.385 --> 11:12.305
for the next six years.

11:12.345 --> 11:13.545
- Lonnie, do you think
I have crow's feet?

11:13.585 --> 11:15.105
- Dennis, what is with
the fucking crow's feet?

11:15.145 --> 11:16.985
What is wrong with you?

11:18.865 --> 11:21.705
- What about a new someone,
like a new Spanker.

11:21.744 --> 11:24.225
- Are you outta your
goddamn, corn-fed mind?

11:24.265 --> 11:25.824
I'm no spring chicken!

11:25.864 --> 11:28.385
I invested the best years
of my life in that dickwad!

11:28.425 --> 11:30.425
No, it is time to dividend
collecting, my friend,

11:30.465 --> 11:31.744
and it's the same
reason you had to fight

11:31.784 --> 11:35.464
for Diedre fucking
Diamond's aging pussy!

11:35.504 --> 11:37.424
We are not 22 years old anymore,

11:37.465 --> 11:39.144
with the world at our fingertips

11:39.184 --> 11:42.024
and people beating down
our door trying to fuck us!

11:42.064 --> 11:42.903
- Speak for yourself.

11:42.945 --> 11:44.944
- Face facts, wild one.

11:44.984 --> 11:48.104
We made our beds and it's
about time we lied in 'em,

11:48.144 --> 11:50.824
'til our geezers die,
we get their money,

11:50.864 --> 11:53.504
and then we start this
whole cycle all over again

11:53.544 --> 11:55.264
except this time, we're the ones

11:55.304 --> 11:58.264
who get to fuck that hard cock.

11:58.304 --> 11:59.824
Or a tail in your place, Lonnie.

11:59.863 --> 12:03.864
My point is, there's
no guarantee I'll
find another speaker

12:05.104 --> 12:06.543
and even if I do, he'll
probably wanna get married

12:06.583 --> 12:09.463
or have children or
something awful like that.

12:09.504 --> 12:11.383
You may think you look
like you did 10 years ago,

12:11.423 --> 12:13.944
but women, when they
meet men at age 30,

12:13.983 --> 12:16.704
want them to have fucking
careers, not a resume

12:16.743 --> 12:20.063
filled with one-night
stands and party-attending!

12:20.104 --> 12:21.103
- Meow.

12:21.143 --> 12:22.423
- Truth hurts, Gugana.

12:22.464 --> 12:24.104
- You two, queerty,
last time I checked,

12:24.143 --> 12:26.463
the sell by date on
chicken of the twink ass,

12:26.503 --> 12:29.303
it expired around age
24 and you, my friend,

12:29.343 --> 12:31.783
are well past that sell by date.

12:31.823 --> 12:33.463
Crow's feet don't lie.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.503
- Bartender, another
round, please!

12:36.543 --> 12:38.743
- Honestly, I don't give a fuck
if he goes back to Arizona.

12:38.783 --> 12:42.143
I just want my rent and
my Barney's card paid.

12:42.183 --> 12:44.462
- Well, tell him you love him.

12:45.942 --> 12:48.103
- That sounds hard.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.462
- Tell him he doesn't
have to be a congressman

12:50.502 --> 12:53.143
to make you happy, that
you'd rather him retire

12:53.183 --> 12:56.542
and live on a congressman's
small pension to be with him.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.702
- True love, that's
playin' dirty.

12:58.742 --> 12:59.702
- Well, so does he,

12:59.743 --> 13:02.062
if Paulette's stories
are even half true.

13:02.103 --> 13:05.383
He'll respect the hardball
tactic and be flattered

13:05.422 --> 13:09.342
that she's the only woman who
loves him for his real self.

13:09.382 --> 13:13.182
- Dennis, that is either
stupid or fucking brilliant.

13:15.222 --> 13:17.302
Thank you, drinks are on me.

13:18.942 --> 13:22.302
(relaxed
singer-songwriter music)

13:22.342 --> 13:24.862
(siren blaring)

13:24.901 --> 13:26.701
- Farleigh's punishing
you for getting old.

13:26.742 --> 13:28.302
You're not old.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.501
- Oh, no, then why's he taking
the Porsche away from me?

13:31.542 --> 13:33.182
- Maybe he needs to
free up some cash.

13:33.222 --> 13:36.902
- No, bullshit, he's
richer than Zuckerberg.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.822
- So you need a job?

13:38.862 --> 13:40.260
Is there anything you can do?

13:40.301 --> 13:42.941
- I thought boy toy
was gonna be it.

13:42.981 --> 13:46.262
If only I'd gone to
college like you.

13:46.301 --> 13:48.182
Everything that seems
mildly interesting

13:48.221 --> 13:51.861
or even tolerable says
college degree required.

13:51.901 --> 13:53.620
- I thought you went to college?

13:53.661 --> 13:57.261
- Four months at Bard,
then I met Farleigh.

13:57.301 --> 13:59.580
It's been Dicklick
Manor ever since.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.341
- I think you're overreacting.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.101
- No, I don't think I am.

14:03.141 --> 14:06.060
The only job I've ever
had was a swimsuit model.

14:06.101 --> 14:09.380
Two weeks in a banana hammock
qualifies me for nothing.

14:09.421 --> 14:11.781
Call boy seems to be about it.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.540
- Ya fuck for things, not money.

14:15.581 --> 14:17.979
If you fuck for money,
it makes you a whore.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.700
(traffic humming)

14:25.341 --> 14:26.181
- You know what?

14:26.220 --> 14:27.180
- [Lonnie] Hmm?

14:27.220 --> 14:28.460
- Maybe all I need to
do is convince Farleigh

14:28.501 --> 14:30.981
that I'm just as
desirable as ever.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.180
- How you gonna do that?

14:32.220 --> 14:35.259
- Are you free tonight?
(Lonnie chuckles)

14:41.260 --> 14:42.900
- Hello, anyone home?

14:47.500 --> 14:48.540
Where's Javi?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.819
- A long day?

14:52.860 --> 14:54.459
- Where's Javi?

14:54.499 --> 14:56.299
- I gave him the night off.

14:56.340 --> 14:57.860
- Why, I'm starving!

14:59.299 --> 15:01.700
- Because I thought my
guy needed pizza tonight.

15:01.739 --> 15:05.299
- Pizza, Javi won't let
me eat pizza anymore.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.219
- I know, that's why I
gave him the night off.

15:08.259 --> 15:09.100
- Good boy.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.419
- Seemed like you could use
a little more comfort food

15:12.459 --> 15:14.379
and a little less tofu stir fry.

15:17.339 --> 15:21.379
- Would you like some verve,
we're also celebrating.

15:22.179 --> 15:23.699
- [Farleigh] Celebrating what?

15:23.739 --> 15:25.099
- I got a job.

15:25.139 --> 15:27.979
- [Farleigh] Really, where?

15:28.019 --> 15:30.338
- At a travel agency.

15:30.378 --> 15:31.458
- They still have those?

15:31.498 --> 15:32.458
- Yes.

15:37.059 --> 15:39.259
- Are you qualified?

15:39.298 --> 15:42.019
(doorbell rings)

15:42.058 --> 15:43.498
- Not yet.

15:43.539 --> 15:44.978
Dinner first.

15:45.019 --> 15:46.177
- I'm not hungry--

15:46.218 --> 15:48.218
- Oh, lies, you just
said you were starving!

15:48.258 --> 15:50.858
(doorbell rings)

15:52.218 --> 15:54.498
(door rattling)

15:54.538 --> 15:57.498
(scoffs) What in the hell
kind of hot mess are you?

15:57.538 --> 15:59.258
- What, fuck face, you said
Farleigh likes 'em young,

15:59.298 --> 16:01.338
so this is what all
those fags are wearin'!

16:01.377 --> 16:03.297
- That's perfect (laughs)!

16:03.338 --> 16:05.058
My God, it's just
very convincing.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.978
- Can it, homo, your
pizza's gettin' cold.

16:07.017 --> 16:08.738
- Your dream, I'll
be right back.

16:08.778 --> 16:09.777
- Yeah.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.817
- Do you have a few
singles for a tip?

16:13.857 --> 16:14.817
- Yes, sure.

16:14.857 --> 16:16.297
- He's so cute, he
deserves a big one.

16:16.337 --> 16:18.218
- Why, uh, I take it, I take it.

16:18.257 --> 16:19.058
- [Dennis] Listen, you
had it, you had it--

16:19.097 --> 16:19.978
- No, no, lemme get--

16:20.018 --> 16:20.737
- He's cute.

16:20.777 --> 16:23.457
(both chattering)

16:23.497 --> 16:25.017
Whoa!
(Farleigh slams to floor)

16:25.057 --> 16:26.376
What the holy hell's
going on here?

16:26.417 --> 16:28.577
- Hey man, uh, who's this?

16:28.616 --> 16:30.656
- This is my boyfriend,

16:30.697 --> 16:31.857
just what is going on here?

16:31.897 --> 16:34.177
- I'm sorry, I, I
thought you were alone.

16:34.217 --> 16:35.897
- You must be kidding, I
leave you alone for a minute

16:35.937 --> 16:37.137
to go and get change and you--

16:37.176 --> 16:38.296
- I thought you said you
were gonna get changed

16:38.336 --> 16:39.696
into something more comfortable.

16:39.737 --> 16:40.976
- I'm quite
comfortable as it is,

16:41.016 --> 16:42.577
thank you very much.

16:42.616 --> 16:45.135
- I, I'm sorry, I thought, we
had a connection at the door.

16:45.177 --> 16:46.697
Um, you're just, you're very--

16:46.737 --> 16:47.615
- [Dennis] Very what?

16:47.657 --> 16:50.137
- You're very fuckable.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.576
Look, please don't tell
my boss about this!

16:52.617 --> 16:53.897
- [Farleigh] Uh,
wait, wait, wait!

16:53.936 --> 16:55.056
Your tip.
- Yeah.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.297
(door rattling)

17:01.297 --> 17:03.617
- Does that happen often?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.976
- What can I say, I'm fuckable.

17:14.215 --> 17:16.215
(Farleigh chuckles)

17:16.256 --> 17:18.976
(Farleigh groans)

17:19.016 --> 17:20.496
- [Dennis] Jesus Christ!

17:20.536 --> 17:22.976
- [Farleigh] (groans) My
ankle, I think it's broken!

17:23.016 --> 17:24.255
(Farleigh groans)

17:24.296 --> 17:26.616
- Oh my God, are you OK?
(Farleigh sighs)

17:26.656 --> 17:29.295
- No, I am fucking not OK,
what does it look like?

17:29.336 --> 17:33.135
(panting) You are
your stupid candles!

17:33.175 --> 17:35.815
(groans) Take me
to the hospital!

17:35.856 --> 17:38.336
(Farleigh groaning over
dramatic electronic music)

17:38.375 --> 17:39.494
- I'm sorry.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.896
- [Javi] Now,
Farleigh, slow down.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.016
I have something for ya.

17:42.055 --> 17:42.934
- Oh, really?

17:42.976 --> 17:44.056
- It's been in my
family for generations.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.374
It's not antique, it's vintage!

17:48.295 --> 17:49.815
- First day at work!

17:51.096 --> 17:54.095
Well, aren't you
gonna wish me luck?

17:54.135 --> 17:56.055
- Let's see how long it lasts.

17:56.095 --> 17:58.575
(cane thunking)

18:00.055 --> 18:03.174
Javi, have the impression that
this cane looks from Kohl's.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.695
- [Javi]
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!

18:08.975 --> 18:12.574
- I'm so sorry, we only
hire PhDs and higher,

18:12.615 --> 18:14.294
including me, as a
doctor of philosophy--

18:14.335 --> 18:16.415
- You know, I'm just bored,

18:16.455 --> 18:18.414
and walking's kind of my gift.

18:18.454 --> 18:21.495
- Absolutely, you're a
legend around here (scoffs).

18:21.535 --> 18:24.094
Wonderkid at 17,
scores sugar daddy

18:24.135 --> 18:25.973
at his first Fashion Week.

18:30.934 --> 18:32.974
- I'm here to get my
car, but I don't see it.

18:33.014 --> 18:34.453
You know where it might be?

18:34.494 --> 18:36.294
- [Man With Glasses] Is
every OK with Farleigh?

18:36.334 --> 18:39.974
- Sure, why would nothing
be OK with Farleigh?

18:41.614 --> 18:42.574
Wow!

18:45.374 --> 18:46.534
Was I supposed to track that?

18:46.574 --> 18:49.854
- It'd be nice if you
knew where it was.

18:52.934 --> 18:55.014
♪ What lies in store ♪

18:55.053 --> 18:58.172
♪ Something that is lost ♪

19:02.694 --> 19:04.413
- If you need money, you know,

19:04.454 --> 19:07.813
I heard the accounting
department is
looking for people.

19:07.853 --> 19:09.414
- You know, we do have
a program that Starbucks

19:09.453 --> 19:11.773
does pay for your college
tuition when you work with us,

19:11.813 --> 19:14.173
so that's something you can
find out on the website.

19:14.214 --> 19:16.093
Do you have the card?

19:16.134 --> 19:17.653
- Thank you.

19:17.693 --> 19:20.373
(Dennis groaning)

19:23.293 --> 19:25.773
(Dennis grunts)

19:28.772 --> 19:31.533
(distant siren blaring)

19:31.573 --> 19:33.933
(Dennis exhales heavily)

19:33.972 --> 19:35.652
(customers chattering)

19:35.693 --> 19:36.973
- Hey.

19:37.012 --> 19:38.213
- Dude, what--

19:38.252 --> 19:39.132
- I've been lookin'
all over for you.

19:39.173 --> 19:40.332
- Aren't you supposed to be

19:40.373 --> 19:42.853
at a travel agency
or something'?

19:42.892 --> 19:43.852
- I need to borrow some money.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.452
- [Javi] (sniffs)
Are you stoned?

19:46.492 --> 19:48.452
What about this job of yours?

19:48.493 --> 19:49.812
- There is no job.

19:51.612 --> 19:53.812
- You've been lyin' to Farleigh
for the last three weeks?

19:53.853 --> 19:55.132
Oh my God, Dennis.

19:55.172 --> 19:56.372
- [Dennis] Please,
it's just a loan.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.731
- Does it look like
I got any money?

19:57.772 --> 19:58.732
- I'm up shit creek!

19:58.772 --> 19:59.651
- [Javi] Then why don't you hock

19:59.692 --> 20:01.252
some of that jewelry you got?

20:01.292 --> 20:02.772
- But these were gifts.

20:06.932 --> 20:07.892
- Gifts?

20:08.692 --> 20:09.811
Wow, true story,

20:12.372 --> 20:15.691
Farleigh was designing a
Standard Hotel on Sunset,

20:15.732 --> 20:17.572
I was takin' a course
to become a life coach.

20:17.611 --> 20:18.811
The Vanity Fair
party was comin' up

20:18.851 --> 20:20.371
and you know that's
everything to me.

20:20.412 --> 20:23.371
And then all of a
sudden, Farleigh

20:27.211 --> 20:28.932
and by what, you ask?

20:28.971 --> 20:32.291
A boy, do you know who
that boy was, Dennis?

20:32.331 --> 20:35.251
That boy was you, everything I
thought I built with Farleigh

20:35.291 --> 20:38.331
was taken away from me, just
like that watch and that ring!

20:38.371 --> 20:39.731
- [Dennis] These
used to be yours?

20:39.771 --> 20:42.611
- Oh, oh, and that $40,000

20:42.651 --> 20:44.611
Tiffany love bracelet,
the one that you leave

20:44.651 --> 20:46.571
layin' around like
fuckin' costume jewelry?

20:46.611 --> 20:48.131
Yeah, that one, too.

20:49.211 --> 20:50.090
- [Dennis] I had no idea--

20:50.131 --> 20:51.371
- Oh, eh-eh, all of a sudden,

20:51.411 --> 20:53.051
I was bein' asked if
I wanted to stay on

20:53.091 --> 20:54.731
as the in-house chef.

20:59.651 --> 21:01.971
- I was your replacement.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.931
You never said anything.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.291
- 'Cause I got class, bitch.

21:10.050 --> 21:11.891
- Do you think
there's someone else?

21:11.930 --> 21:13.770
Some little skater
dude from Venice

21:13.811 --> 21:16.011
with second-grade highlight
and low-riding shorts

21:16.050 --> 21:17.010
that lets his ass whisper,

21:17.050 --> 21:19.929
andquot;Come ride the
innocence out of me?andquot;

21:21.370 --> 21:24.570
- Dennis, you never pay
much attention to his work.

21:24.610 --> 21:26.050
I think he's shootin' today,

21:26.090 --> 21:27.690
why don't you go surprise
him, wish him luck?

21:27.730 --> 21:29.570
- I hate being
around those cameras!

21:29.610 --> 21:31.370
- Dennis, you peacock
around all day anyway,

21:31.410 --> 21:33.530
I don't understand,
what's the problem?

21:33.570 --> 21:36.729
(customers chattering)

21:38.409 --> 21:39.570
- Wait, I need gas money.

21:39.609 --> 21:41.650
- Really, Dennis, really?

21:43.290 --> 21:46.570
(scoffs) God, you're,

21:46.609 --> 21:49.649
here, go, go, bye, bye, bye.
- Thank you.

21:51.609 --> 21:53.170
(Javi sighs)

21:53.209 --> 21:55.889
(traffic humming)

22:02.169 --> 22:03.528
- [Director] Action!

22:03.569 --> 22:05.489
- [Farleigh] And as we all
know, it's been rumored

22:05.529 --> 22:08.609
that she has had affairs with
all of her husband's generals,

22:08.649 --> 22:10.529
quite a party girl.

22:10.569 --> 22:12.689
- Look, Farleigh, this
is a common perception

22:12.729 --> 22:13.608
of Pauline Bonaparte.

22:13.649 --> 22:15.169
What Pauline Bonaparte
is trying to do,

22:15.209 --> 22:17.249
she's just trying to say up
yours to the French nobility.

22:17.289 --> 22:18.529
She's not trying
to act like a pute,

22:18.568 --> 22:21.529
she's trying to be a
revolutionary, you see?

22:21.569 --> 22:24.449
- Yes, I, I, um,
I'm just impressed.

22:25.409 --> 22:28.208
But well, that is when street--

22:28.249 --> 22:29.328
- Meets chic.

22:29.369 --> 22:30.329
- Oh my.

22:33.168 --> 22:33.889
Dennis?

22:33.928 --> 22:35.088
- [Dennis] For you.

22:35.129 --> 22:37.248
- Uh, well, what
are you doing here?

22:37.288 --> 22:38.448
- [Dennis] I just
wanted to wish you luck,

22:38.488 --> 22:39.768
is that so unusual?

22:39.809 --> 22:41.848
- Um, no no no, um, c-can we
take a break here, please?

22:41.888 --> 22:42.848
Can we take?

22:44.368 --> 22:46.128
Oh, well, Dennis, uh, join us!

22:46.168 --> 22:49.328
I would like for
you to meet Jasper.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.207
- [Dennis] The pool boy?

22:51.248 --> 22:52.968
- Yes, uh, Jasper
has been working

22:53.008 --> 22:55.008
in a pool-related capacity.

22:56.048 --> 22:58.248
- What's he doing here?

22:58.288 --> 22:59.528
- (clears throat) I made him

22:59.568 --> 23:01.087
the lead designer
of this project.

23:01.128 --> 23:02.408
- What?

23:02.448 --> 23:04.567
Is this restaurant underwater?

23:04.608 --> 23:06.648
- (chuckles) I love
your sense of humor!

23:06.688 --> 23:08.527
No, I am mentoring him.

23:12.048 --> 23:13.487
- Mentor this, Mr. Chips.

23:13.528 --> 23:16.288
(glass shattering)

23:17.808 --> 23:21.368
- Quite a party, what, what
is the most impressive thing

23:22.007 --> 23:23.246
that you would chose,

23:23.287 --> 23:26.647
that would occur to you
here at this sculpture?

23:27.727 --> 23:30.047
- Um, well, this, this is a,

23:31.207 --> 23:34.247
uh, it's a naked woman
and a, and a child.

23:35.246 --> 23:36.167
Eh.

23:42.126 --> 23:43.807
- [Dennis] I caught
Farleigh with the pool boy.

23:43.847 --> 23:45.646
- What, what pool boy?

23:45.686 --> 23:47.486
- The little Latin shit who
picks leaves out of our pool

23:47.527 --> 23:49.327
is Farleigh's new designer.

23:49.366 --> 23:53.126
- The one you called the
Colombian Keane painting?

23:53.167 --> 23:55.286
Oh, you caught them fucking?

23:55.326 --> 23:58.006
- No, not fucking, designing.

23:58.046 --> 23:59.926
- Well, that's
probably all it is.

23:59.966 --> 24:01.567
- He's on the show.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.765
- Ooh, yeah, that's not good.

24:03.806 --> 24:05.726
- [Diedre] Darling,
I need some help.

24:05.766 --> 24:07.686
- I'm in the foyer!

24:07.726 --> 24:10.726
- And who, pray
tell, is our visitor?

24:10.766 --> 24:13.365
- Uh, it's a buddy
of mine from the gym.

24:13.406 --> 24:17.166
- Hello, ma'am, I'm
Dennis, it's a pleasure.

24:17.205 --> 24:20.566
I've read your column ever
since I was a little boy.

24:20.606 --> 24:22.806
- You're much too kind.

24:22.845 --> 24:26.886
- Eh, Dennis got into a
fight with his boyfriend.

24:28.045 --> 24:31.006
- (gasps) How could
anyone possibly fight

24:31.046 --> 24:33.926
with a young man so
handsome and divine?

24:33.965 --> 24:37.525
Lonnie, darling, let's
get this one a drink.

24:37.565 --> 24:38.645
Perhaps an Arnold Palmer,

24:38.685 --> 24:40.604
they could be so
refreshing in this heat.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.445
- [Lonnie] Sure.

24:46.045 --> 24:47.005
- Of course.

24:48.205 --> 24:51.125
- You know (sighs), men,
especially the powerful ones

24:51.165 --> 24:54.885
with fragile egos, can be
so difficult sometimes.

24:56.045 --> 24:58.885
Eh, Hilary, Clinton
that is, once told me

24:58.924 --> 25:01.605
after a beau and had
a legendary spat,

25:01.644 --> 25:03.685
andquot;You just need to get
back in the saddle

25:03.724 --> 25:06.604
andquot;and ride them to
the finish line!andquot;

25:06.645 --> 25:08.885
- I'll remember that.
(Diedre chuckles)

25:08.924 --> 25:12.004
I'm very sorry to have
stopped by unannounced.

25:12.045 --> 25:14.245
Clearly, you two are off
to some kind of engagement.

25:14.284 --> 25:17.884
- Oh, it's just some silly gala
raising money for something.

25:17.925 --> 25:20.524
I have won an
award, I do believe.

25:20.565 --> 25:22.964
That's how they force
ya to attend (laughs).

25:23.004 --> 25:27.044
Oh, Lonnie, darling, I
am in dire need of a Kir.

25:28.204 --> 25:29.604
- I should go, I can
talk to Lonnie later.

25:29.644 --> 25:31.644
- Oh, I wouldn't
hear of such a thing!

25:31.684 --> 25:33.684
I do not allow
wounded little birds

25:33.724 --> 25:37.284
back into the wild to be
devoured by the alley cats,

25:37.323 --> 25:40.202
and certainly not one
as adorable as you.

25:40.244 --> 25:41.842
- Oh, I'll be fine.

25:41.884 --> 25:44.043
- You should join
us at the gala.

25:44.084 --> 25:47.163
- I couldn't impose,
besides, I'm hardly dressed.

25:47.203 --> 25:49.683
- That is easily
fixed, you appear to be

25:49.724 --> 25:51.723
about my Lonnie's size.

25:51.763 --> 25:54.042
I'm sure we will
find him something.

25:54.083 --> 25:57.603
Lonnie, darling, we have
a third at the gala!

25:59.084 --> 26:02.563
(crowd chattering over
pleasant piano music)

26:02.603 --> 26:04.483
- [Morley] Did Diedre commit
to posting this story?

26:04.523 --> 26:08.603
- [Betsy] Nope, no such
thing as free press, darling.

26:09.763 --> 26:10.923
- [Morley] The money
goes to a good cause.

26:10.963 --> 26:12.442
It's her boy toy
that's insufferable.

26:12.483 --> 26:15.763
- [Betsy] (scoffs) They
say he's Ivy League.

26:15.803 --> 26:19.243
- [Morley] Ocean League is
more like it (chuckles).

26:19.282 --> 26:21.323
- Diedre says his
cock is huge, oh,

26:21.362 --> 26:23.282
and that other boy, Ethan--
(Morley gasping)

26:23.323 --> 26:26.282
- Did sitting wars
at the charity table
become fashionable?

26:26.323 --> 26:29.482
- (laughs) Paying
for sex, I applaud.

26:29.523 --> 26:33.562
Paying for love,
tragic (chuckles)!

26:34.763 --> 26:35.723
- Excuse me,

26:38.282 --> 26:40.121
like you think
you're so important

26:40.162 --> 26:44.202
because you're ran Fox for
three months in the 1990s.

26:45.002 --> 26:47.162
Who cares, who fucking cares?

26:49.282 --> 26:52.202
I know this guy, and
you're full of shit.

26:52.242 --> 26:53.642
- Let's get outta here.

26:53.682 --> 26:54.402
- What about Diedre?

26:54.442 --> 26:55.881
- [Lonnie] Let's go!

26:57.442 --> 27:01.002
I just can't do this anymore,
like I really do love Diedre!

27:01.042 --> 27:02.281
- [Dennis] I know that.

27:02.322 --> 27:03.562
- I'd give anything to
have an Arnold Palmer

27:03.601 --> 27:07.122
and my Kindle in the Adirondack
chair in the backyard.

27:12.001 --> 27:13.761
- [Lonnie] Do we, wanna cut out?

27:16.002 --> 27:17.282
- [Dennis] I don't
wanna go home.

27:17.321 --> 27:20.601
- [Lonnie] Me either, I've got
Diedre's Amex in my pocket.

27:20.641 --> 27:21.961
I think we should go
all out and get a suite.

27:22.001 --> 27:24.801
- [Dennis] Ooh, money bags!

27:24.841 --> 27:27.281
- How the fuck am I supposed
to run this household

27:27.321 --> 27:30.641
if he's runnin' off with my
staff and not tellin' me!

27:30.681 --> 27:32.121
(Javi grunts)

27:32.161 --> 27:34.321
- Isn't it the issue
that he isn't telling me?

27:34.361 --> 27:38.200
- No, no no no, don't
you dare feel defeated!

27:38.241 --> 27:40.241
And don't you dare give up.

27:41.361 --> 27:43.961
Farleigh is your man,
you fight for him!

27:44.001 --> 27:44.841
- You didn't.

27:46.201 --> 27:48.719
- Yeah, well, I didn't
love him, did I?

27:48.761 --> 27:49.881
Not like you do.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.360
(Javi grunts)

27:56.040 --> 27:58.401
He loves you, you have history.

28:01.721 --> 28:02.680
- He does?

28:04.321 --> 28:05.919
- He left you a note.

28:10.160 --> 28:13.720
(water bubbling from faucet)

28:18.560 --> 28:21.440
(paper rustling)

28:21.480 --> 28:23.760
- Why are you helping me?

28:23.800 --> 28:25.920
- Because we have history.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.560
Go take a nap, you
look like shit!

28:32.759 --> 28:33.598
- [Maitre D] Good
evening, darling.

28:33.640 --> 28:34.679
- Good evening, how are you?

28:34.720 --> 28:35.399
- [Maitre D] Specialty,
always on us.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.679
- Thank you, sir.

28:36.719 --> 28:37.679
- [Maitre D] I think
you'll care to love.

28:37.719 --> 28:39.720
- Well, I should
be seeing as I do.

28:39.759 --> 28:41.080
Good evening, how are you?

28:41.119 --> 28:41.920
- [Man With Glasses] Good.
- How are you?

28:41.959 --> 28:43.479
- Excuse me, thank you.

28:43.519 --> 28:47.358
(patrons chattering over
rhythmic blues music)

28:47.400 --> 28:48.479
- [Farleigh] You
know, and do you see?

28:48.519 --> 28:49.719
- It's classy.

28:49.759 --> 28:50.519
- And do you see the
reflection of the moon

28:50.560 --> 28:52.079
on, on, on the roof?

28:54.359 --> 28:56.519
(Jasper snickers)

28:56.559 --> 28:59.318
Dennis, you remember Jasper?

28:59.359 --> 29:00.679
- Yes, of course.

29:04.759 --> 29:06.239
- Yes, of course.

29:07.479 --> 29:11.359
- So, it's time for you boys
to get to know each other.

29:12.759 --> 29:13.599
Jasper is the one who is
going to be the breakout star

29:13.638 --> 29:15.879
of Hard Nock Design and you,

29:15.919 --> 29:19.398
you are and you always
will be, my muse,

29:19.438 --> 29:22.998
so it is imperative to
me that you get along.

29:23.958 --> 29:25.239
- Dennis, I hope you don't mind,

29:25.278 --> 29:26.838
we, uh, we already
ordered the wine.

29:26.879 --> 29:29.397
I hate red and they have,
what, two bottles of French?

29:29.438 --> 29:30.558
Farleigh, here, can't live

29:30.599 --> 29:32.918
without the Marlborough
Sauvignon Blanc.

29:32.958 --> 29:34.118
- Yes, I know.

29:36.318 --> 29:39.558
- What's your, uh, what's
your story, Dennis?

29:39.598 --> 29:42.838
- I went to college and never
finished, how about you?

29:42.878 --> 29:46.116
- I tried to convince him to
continue it and finish, but--

29:46.158 --> 29:47.917
- The point of going to
Santa Monica City is, what,

29:47.958 --> 29:49.837
to be an assistant accountant?

29:49.878 --> 29:52.798
Can't do anything
important there.

29:52.837 --> 29:55.357
- Where does one do
something important, Dennis?

29:55.398 --> 29:56.397
- I don't know.

29:58.118 --> 30:00.878
One of the Ivys, Brown maybe.

30:00.918 --> 30:01.998
- No, I think we're going to go

30:02.037 --> 30:03.837
with the Sonoma
Sauvignon Blanc, please?

30:03.877 --> 30:05.597
- Good choice.
- Thank you.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.957
- You seem very precocious
for a barrio boy.

30:07.997 --> 30:11.077
- Dennis, that was both
racist and class-elitist.

30:11.117 --> 30:12.797
- No, it's OK, I don't mind.

30:12.837 --> 30:16.117
It's, uh, I'm very
proud of my background.

30:16.157 --> 30:18.477
It may not be what you
value, but it's real.

30:18.517 --> 30:19.957
That's enough for me.

30:19.997 --> 30:21.437
- (snickers) Oh,
you're so generous.

30:21.477 --> 30:23.277
- So tell me again, how did, um,

30:23.317 --> 30:25.917
Jasper show you
his authenticity?

30:28.037 --> 30:30.637
- Well, it was
actually at the pool.

30:30.677 --> 30:34.197
- Ah, your favorite spot
to display your talent.

30:34.237 --> 30:35.757
- Well, Farleigh, here,
was having a little trouble

30:35.796 --> 30:37.237
with the entrance and, uh--

30:37.276 --> 30:39.236
- That's never been
your problem with me!

30:39.277 --> 30:41.797
- The entrance of the
restaurant, come on!

30:41.836 --> 30:43.397
(Jasper laughing)

30:43.437 --> 30:44.716
The stone, the stone wall,

30:44.756 --> 30:46.516
the facade was just
too oppressive!

30:46.556 --> 30:48.357
- It's true, yeah, he through
a pencil into the pool.

30:48.396 --> 30:49.916
I've never seen him so riled up.

30:49.956 --> 30:52.596
- (chuckles) And he fished
it out and started to sketch,

30:52.636 --> 30:55.796
and he, he brought that, that,

30:55.836 --> 30:59.636
that creativity that he changed
the, the rhythm of the stone

31:00.876 --> 31:02.676
that made it weightless,
and that was the moment.

31:02.716 --> 31:05.756
That was the moment when I
realized it would be a crime

31:05.796 --> 31:09.155
not to take the boy out of
the hood and into my show.

31:09.196 --> 31:11.916
- So where did you develop
this talent, Jasper?

31:11.956 --> 31:14.714
Your parents still
live in East LA?

31:14.755 --> 31:18.076
- Uh, no, I never, never
met my parents, actually.

31:18.116 --> 31:19.794
They died when I
was very young, so.

31:19.835 --> 31:21.715
- I'm sorry for your loss.

31:23.835 --> 31:25.956
- It's OK, it happens, eh?

31:27.155 --> 31:30.315
- You always tell me
that I inspire you,

31:31.555 --> 31:34.075
but I know that I could never
be your creative partner.

31:34.115 --> 31:36.915
It's, pff, I can't
create anything.

31:39.075 --> 31:40.955
You're talented and smart.

31:47.634 --> 31:49.075
no matter the cost.

31:50.995 --> 31:54.155
- Sometimes I realize
why I love you, Dennis.

31:54.195 --> 31:57.355
- That's sweet (laughs).

31:59.714 --> 32:01.834
Who's ready to order, huh?

32:03.274 --> 32:04.994
- [Farleigh] So, did
you like the food?

32:05.035 --> 32:06.594
- [Jasper] Si, it's fantastic.

32:06.634 --> 32:07.994
- Yes, it was excellent.

32:08.035 --> 32:10.235
Oh, there he is, all right.

32:10.274 --> 32:12.754
(engine idling)

32:19.514 --> 32:21.394
I'll give Jasper a lift.

32:21.434 --> 32:22.754
Jasper, you drive?

32:24.154 --> 32:25.314
- [Jasper] Nice
seeing you, Dennis.

32:25.353 --> 32:27.553
Hope to see you again
soon sometime, eh?

32:27.594 --> 32:30.674
- No worries, I'll
be right back home.

32:33.154 --> 32:36.233
(engine rumbles away)

32:37.754 --> 32:40.834
(moody indie rock music)

32:52.713 --> 32:55.312
(birds chirping)

32:58.954 --> 33:01.993
(cane tapping on floor)

33:03.873 --> 33:06.353
- [Dennis] Got Jasper home safe?

33:07.392 --> 33:09.032
- [Farleigh] I did.

33:11.192 --> 33:12.193
- It's six a.m.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.712
Do you love me?

33:27.313 --> 33:28.231
- Dennis, um--

33:28.273 --> 33:29.312
- I love you.

33:31.072 --> 33:34.832
(birds chirping and whistling)

33:50.352 --> 33:53.472
(uneasy whooshing tones)

34:02.351 --> 34:05.631
(expressive rock music)

34:20.471 --> 34:21.670
- [Lonnie] Somebody got married!

34:21.710 --> 34:24.429
- Get the fuck outta
here, how did that happen?

34:24.471 --> 34:25.670
- Well, I didn't come home,

34:25.710 --> 34:27.391
and yesterday morning
when I stumbled in,

34:27.429 --> 34:28.831
Diedre was out of
her mind with worry.

34:28.871 --> 34:30.150
She thought I left
her after her friends

34:30.190 --> 34:32.110
treated me like shit, anyhow,

34:32.150 --> 34:34.231
she was so relieved that
I got back that she, uh,

34:34.271 --> 34:35.630
immediately proposed marriage,

34:35.670 --> 34:37.351
and, yeah, we did
it at the Caesars.

34:37.391 --> 34:39.110
- All right, man,
congratulations!

34:39.150 --> 34:39.871
- Thanks.

34:39.909 --> 34:41.469
- You need a houseboy?

34:41.511 --> 34:43.070
- [Lonnie] What are
you talkin' about?

34:43.110 --> 34:44.909
- My days are numbered.

34:44.951 --> 34:48.231
Farleigh's fucking the pool
boy, a.k.a. the lead designer

34:48.271 --> 34:50.190
on the new cycle of his TV show.

34:50.230 --> 34:52.150
- Honey, we have to get
Farleigh out of the house,

34:52.190 --> 34:54.551
you can work him a lot better
without that pool slut around.

34:54.590 --> 34:55.710
- That's not a bad idea.

34:55.750 --> 34:56.949
- They are shutting
down next week

34:56.989 --> 34:58.110
while they wait on
building inspectors.

34:58.150 --> 34:59.390
- Perfect, give him a gift.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.630
- A romantic getaway.

35:00.670 --> 35:01.990
- You'll have to leave
that pool slut in charge

35:02.030 --> 35:02.949
for a little while, you don't
need much time with Farleigh.

35:02.990 --> 35:04.190
You got this!

35:04.230 --> 35:05.630
- I think I'm losing.

35:05.670 --> 35:08.110
- Dennis, you're one
hot piece of ass,

35:08.150 --> 35:09.390
and you're charming
as all get out.

35:09.430 --> 35:10.350
- Damn straight!

35:10.390 --> 35:12.269
- Farleigh loves you,
seduce him again.

35:12.310 --> 35:13.830
- There's just one problem.

35:13.870 --> 35:17.229
- Aw, baby, those crow's feet
are barely even noticeable!

35:17.270 --> 35:18.910
- That's not what I'm
talking about, bitch,

35:18.950 --> 35:20.909
my problem is I'm broke.

35:20.949 --> 35:22.829
I don't have any
money to be able

35:22.869 --> 35:24.150
to book a romantic getaway.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.749
- OK, well, we got ya covered.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.550
- Farleigh knows I
don't have any money.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.269
- How 'bout that travel
agency ruse you pulled?

35:30.309 --> 35:32.189
Just tell him you gotta
go look at a property.

35:32.229 --> 35:33.069
- Where?

35:33.110 --> 35:34.029
- [Paulette] Yeah, where?

35:34.070 --> 35:36.629
- My wife and I,
we have a place.

35:38.389 --> 35:41.389
(chuckles) It's gonna
be all right, darling.

35:41.429 --> 35:45.469
(plane engines roaring
over pleasant Latin guitar)

35:49.588 --> 35:53.389
(pleasant Latin guitar
over cars honking)

36:00.708 --> 36:03.269
- Excellent,
already medium rare.

36:06.549 --> 36:07.789
- I need a boat.

36:07.828 --> 36:08.509
(boatman speaking
foreign language)

36:08.548 --> 36:09.788
Uh, yes, now, please.

36:09.829 --> 36:13.588
(boatman speaking
foreign language)

36:15.188 --> 36:16.228
- [Javi] That's like two hours!

36:16.268 --> 36:17.868
- Javi, I have this, thank you.

36:17.908 --> 36:20.308
- I told you to let me
handle the arrangements!

36:20.348 --> 36:24.388
(boatman speaking
foreign language)

36:28.068 --> 36:29.948
(women chattering)

36:29.988 --> 36:30.988
- I'm going in.

36:32.748 --> 36:35.748
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa,
I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.

36:35.788 --> 36:37.747
Looks like you two
ladies could use a hand.

36:37.788 --> 36:40.787
- Why, yes, I think we could.
(Heather chuckles)

36:40.828 --> 36:42.787
- Baggage, huh, who needs it?

36:42.827 --> 36:44.747
- So, are you coming or going?

36:44.788 --> 36:45.628
- Uh, coming.

36:45.668 --> 36:48.626
- Oh, good, us, too (giggles)!

36:48.668 --> 36:50.387
- I hear you got the last boat.

36:50.428 --> 36:52.747
- Yeah, you looking for a ride?

36:52.788 --> 36:55.907
(Heather laughs)

36:55.948 --> 36:59.547
So I work in social media
and Wall Street Journal,

36:59.587 --> 37:00.827
and I got it basically--

37:00.867 --> 37:02.827
- [Heather] Amazing,
so I have to talk

37:02.867 --> 37:04.347
about it a little bit.

37:04.387 --> 37:06.067
- [Brittny] And then drunk
shopping is basically

37:06.107 --> 37:07.067
number one destination.

37:07.107 --> 37:08.667
- [Heather] Oh my God, totally!

37:08.707 --> 37:11.067
- [Brittny] I set out an
entirely separate budget

37:11.107 --> 37:13.386
and set up a different bank
account just for this trip.

37:13.427 --> 37:14.987
- [Farleigh] Thank you,
ladies, for the ride.

37:15.027 --> 37:16.227
- [Brittny] Girl,
blow the fuck off!

37:16.266 --> 37:17.466
- [Heather] I am!

37:17.506 --> 37:18.307
- [Farleigh] Thank
you, thank you.

37:18.346 --> 37:19.827
- [Dennis] Hey, come on.

37:19.866 --> 37:21.547
(women laughing)

37:21.587 --> 37:23.347
You have it, your bags?
- I'm good.

37:23.387 --> 37:24.546
- I have a twisted
ankle, I'm not dead.

37:24.587 --> 37:25.746
- [Dennis] Keep
that still, please.

37:25.786 --> 37:28.307
Gentlemen, can we have
someone help this guy, please?

37:28.346 --> 37:29.306
You OK?

37:30.787 --> 37:31.945
One more.

37:31.987 --> 37:34.186
- [Javi] Let's get
this bag off the boat.

37:34.227 --> 37:36.386
- [Dennis] Thank you.

37:36.427 --> 37:40.466
- [Javi] Tell me we're gonna
have more service here!

37:51.826 --> 37:53.066
(door rattling)

37:53.106 --> 37:55.505
- Can't be less worse,
this better be Xanadu.

38:02.266 --> 38:06.306
Oh my Lord, is this the house
of that shrew Diedre Diamond?

38:08.265 --> 38:09.745
- I don't know,
she must've rented

38:09.785 --> 38:12.264
this place out
through my agency.

38:12.305 --> 38:15.385
- If it was, I don't
know what to say.

38:16.785 --> 38:20.825
A weekend spent in this
debris of a storied career!

38:22.265 --> 38:26.025
This is camp heaven,
will you look at this?

38:26.065 --> 38:30.025
Diedre Diamond with the stars
of yesteryear, there's, uh--

38:30.065 --> 38:31.905
- Looks like you're happy
I stole him away from LA.

38:31.945 --> 38:35.745
- Jack Lemmon (laughs),
Tony Danza, Tony Dana.

38:37.585 --> 38:38.905
Oh, Bill Clinton,
yeah, of course!

38:38.945 --> 38:40.744
- Should we find the
liquor and go step outside?

38:40.784 --> 38:42.225
- I could look at these forever!

38:42.265 --> 38:44.064
- You know I hear the
beach is clothing optional.

(Farleigh muttering)

40:14.862 --> 40:16.462
- I understand, but whose idea

40:16.502 --> 40:19.542
was that freestanding
oyster soleil bar?

40:19.582 --> 40:21.462
And where is Jasper now,

40:21.502 --> 40:23.222
then go find that little fuck!

40:23.262 --> 40:25.221
(phone beeps)

40:25.263 --> 40:27.622
- Something the matter?

40:27.662 --> 40:31.462
- Yes, something's
the matter (scoffs)!

40:31.502 --> 40:34.142
Gordon told Jasper that he
wanted that oyster soleil,

40:34.182 --> 40:35.701
fucking Jasper thought
it was a brilliant idea

40:35.742 --> 40:38.542
to change all plans and
install a freestanding bar,

40:38.581 --> 40:39.582
which, of course, had to fail

40:39.622 --> 40:41.662
the final inspection of the ADA!

40:41.702 --> 40:43.422
- ADA?

40:43.462 --> 40:45.142
- Americans with
Disabilities Act,

40:45.181 --> 40:46.942
'cause in this country,
even if you are crippled,

40:46.981 --> 40:49.461
it is your God-given
right to sit

40:49.502 --> 40:51.582
at the oyster bar.

40:51.621 --> 40:53.860
(Farleigh grunts)

40:53.902 --> 40:55.262
Fuckin' Jasper!

40:55.302 --> 40:59.341
- Well, what does this
have to do with Jasper?

41:00.821 --> 41:02.022
- Gordon Ramsey's gonna have
a fit when he's been told

41:02.061 --> 41:04.062
that his celebrity opening
has been postponed,

41:04.101 --> 41:07.141
and we don't have anyone
to tell him on camera!

41:07.181 --> 41:10.181
I'm here and fuckin' Jasper
has gone missing, vanished!

41:10.221 --> 41:12.061
God knows where!

41:12.101 --> 41:15.060
Christ, I should have
never allowed him

41:16.141 --> 41:18.500
to take so much responsibility!

41:19.301 --> 41:22.741
(breathing heavily) Dennis,

41:24.621 --> 41:26.981
this season has to be the best.

41:27.901 --> 41:28.861
If not,

41:32.620 --> 41:36.660
(sighs) the show is what runs
my business, you understand?

41:37.781 --> 41:41.300
Even if I make it
back in time, I, I, I,

41:41.340 --> 41:43.220
I don't know if I can
reassemble the crew.

41:43.260 --> 41:46.780
- Can you call a
friend to go on camera?

41:46.820 --> 41:47.780
Nate Berkus?

41:47.820 --> 41:49.780
- That ugly queen?

41:49.820 --> 41:51.580
Over my dead body!

41:51.620 --> 41:55.180
Javi, get me back on the next
flight to America, wherever!

41:55.220 --> 41:56.340
- But what about our trip?

41:56.380 --> 41:57.900
- Do, uh, excuse me?

41:57.940 --> 42:00.260
Haven't you heard, you are
not the Queen of England,

42:00.300 --> 42:02.020
and unless you
have a private jet,

42:02.060 --> 42:04.019
the next available flight
is the day after tomorrow.

42:04.060 --> 42:06.460
Now, you need some sunscreen.

42:08.820 --> 42:12.258
(rhythmic Latin jazz music)

42:14.739 --> 42:17.098
- [Farleigh] OK, OK,
what's the update?

42:17.140 --> 42:18.380
- [Man On Phone]
So we weren't able

42:18.420 --> 42:19.859
to get Gordon with
the camera team--

42:19.900 --> 42:21.300
- No, the camera
team is not enough.

42:21.339 --> 42:23.859
If Gordon Ramsey, if
Gordon Ramsey yells

42:23.900 --> 42:26.179
and there's no one
there to be humiliated,

42:26.220 --> 42:28.459
how can this be reality TV?

42:29.979 --> 42:31.699
No, I'm, I'm in the
middle of a swamp!

42:31.739 --> 42:32.819
- [Boatman] You
like my boat, huh?

42:32.859 --> 42:35.179
- I've been eaten by snakes!

42:36.179 --> 42:36.899
(phone beeping)

42:36.939 --> 42:40.859
(sighs) Very nice here.

42:40.899 --> 42:43.619
- Dennis, oh my fucking God!

42:43.659 --> 42:44.859
(Heather chuckles)

42:44.899 --> 42:46.099
- Hello, ladies!

42:46.138 --> 42:48.138
- You guys have to join
us, we just got here.

42:48.179 --> 42:49.419
- Brit, they're busy!

42:49.458 --> 42:51.698
Their dad's not gonna
wanna take shots with us!

42:51.739 --> 42:53.659
(Farleigh slaps table)

42:53.698 --> 42:54.658
- Rubbish!

42:56.058 --> 42:57.499
Look, Brittny,
maybe you're right.

43:02.738 --> 43:05.618
So, what do you say,
let the adventures start

43:05.658 --> 43:06.738
and order some margaritas!

43:06.778 --> 43:07.498
(Heather laughs)

43:07.538 --> 43:09.299
- Yes, oh my God!

43:09.338 --> 43:11.779
- I know we gonna have
some talk up there!

43:11.818 --> 43:15.778
(all chattering over
pleasant Latin guitar)

43:17.018 --> 43:19.058
- [Brittny] OK, so he's
here visiting family.

43:19.098 --> 43:20.738
- No, girl, he's here for work.

43:20.778 --> 43:23.498
- OK, yeah, we meet
him at the ATM.

43:23.538 --> 43:25.578
- [Heather] Oh my
God, he's so hot!

43:25.618 --> 43:27.378
- Uh-huh, oh my God!

43:28.578 --> 43:29.617
He's here, he said
he might join us!

43:29.658 --> 43:31.218
- (scoffs) Yes!

43:31.258 --> 43:33.298
I think he might be from,
like, Europe or something.

43:33.337 --> 43:34.658
- Oh, now I'm even
more intrigued!

43:34.697 --> 43:36.297
I love playing gay European.

43:36.337 --> 43:37.857
- [Farleigh] I'd
love to see him, too.

43:37.897 --> 43:40.057
- He's not European, he's
like a Colombia person.

43:40.097 --> 43:42.177
- Well it doesn't, ooh!
- Oh!

43:48.777 --> 43:49.737
- Jasper?

43:53.497 --> 43:54.337
wait!

43:54.377 --> 43:55.617
- I'll handle this, excuse me.

43:55.657 --> 43:56.817
- You know him?

43:56.857 --> 43:58.816
- This is so twisted,
did he follow us?

43:58.857 --> 44:00.297
- Will you explain
what's going on?

44:00.337 --> 44:02.417
- That pool boy
is a homewrecker.

44:02.457 --> 44:05.415
- (scoffs) I told
you he was a mo.

44:05.457 --> 44:07.896
Wait, and what are you
doing cheating on Dennis?

44:07.937 --> 44:10.897
- I'm not, that's
Dennis' boyfriend.

44:10.936 --> 44:12.257
- Your dad?

44:12.296 --> 44:14.496
- Oh my God, should we leave?

44:15.937 --> 44:17.577
No, no no, you can't.

44:20.096 --> 44:21.417
Brit, phones down.

44:22.817 --> 44:24.776
OK, here's the deal.

44:24.816 --> 44:28.857
We all love chasing men
who don't want us, right?

44:29.937 --> 44:33.496
I mean, it makes the
indifference that much sexier.

44:34.376 --> 44:35.216
Listen, you have
to give Farleigh

44:35.256 --> 44:37.256
a chance to come chase you!

44:37.296 --> 44:40.616
I mean, you have to trust
that he's gonna come back.

44:40.656 --> 44:43.576
(relaxed Latin guitar)

44:51.056 --> 44:55.095
(quietly tense and
uneasy ambient music)

45:08.295 --> 45:10.015
- Come on, let's go in.

45:13.855 --> 45:17.015
(cane crunching into sand)

45:17.055 --> 45:18.815
- So are you planning on
telling me what's going on?

45:18.855 --> 45:20.934
- Ah, it all seems
rather complicated.

45:20.975 --> 45:21.895
- No doubt.

45:21.935 --> 45:24.134
- He said he freaked out.

45:24.175 --> 45:25.415
- About what?

45:25.455 --> 45:28.054
- The job, the show,
what it would mean,

45:28.095 --> 45:30.614
and when he screwed up
that oyster bar inspection,

45:30.655 --> 45:32.335
it seems to have
hit him all at once.

45:32.374 --> 45:33.855
- So he followed us down here?

45:33.894 --> 45:37.054
- No, his uncle lives
right outside of Cartagena.

45:37.095 --> 45:38.054
- What?

45:39.575 --> 45:42.054
- His uncle, uh,
wanted to see him,

45:42.095 --> 45:44.774
and with the pretext of
a long-overdue visit,

45:44.815 --> 45:47.734
he's got an airline
ticket from him.

45:47.774 --> 45:51.814
- Bullshit, that's about as
real as your reality TV show.

45:55.094 --> 45:58.053
- Dennis, Javi got us tickets
to the next available flight.

45:58.094 --> 46:01.534
We'll be back in Los
Angeles day after tomorrow.

46:01.574 --> 46:03.214
Set my chair up here.

46:04.774 --> 46:07.174
(objects thunk to the ground)

46:07.213 --> 46:08.774
- I'm not your manservant.

46:13.094 --> 46:14.454
For fuck's sake!

46:16.654 --> 46:18.373
(chair slams into sand)

46:18.414 --> 46:19.374
There.

46:20.413 --> 46:24.373
(uneasy acoustic guitar over
ambient electronic music)

46:47.733 --> 46:50.413
(water splashing)

47:11.172 --> 47:13.692
- [Jasper] Can I have a smoke?

47:16.452 --> 47:20.492
- Come on, Dennis, we can
make this work, can't we?

47:24.972 --> 47:26.852
I have some questions I'd
like to ask him about you.

47:26.892 --> 47:29.012
- Don't, don't worry
about my uncle, please.

47:29.052 --> 47:32.212
(Dennis chuckles)

47:32.251 --> 47:35.332
- (sighs) You're
hiding something.

47:35.372 --> 47:38.492
(crickets chirping)

47:41.211 --> 47:42.691
- Dennis, I'm not
hiding anything,

47:42.731 --> 47:44.611
I just have to make things
right with Farleigh, you know?

47:44.651 --> 47:45.690
- Mm, I'll say!

47:47.852 --> 47:51.651
I've never seen him
so worked up (scoffs)!

47:52.851 --> 47:56.211
You're good for him,
much better than me.

47:58.211 --> 48:01.171
Did you check on him
when he got back?

48:01.211 --> 48:02.571
- You've been drinking, Dennis.

48:02.611 --> 48:04.891
- Answer the fucking question!

48:07.051 --> 48:09.530
- No, no, I didn't check on him.

48:10.771 --> 48:13.651
- He depends on you,
and when you leave him

48:13.690 --> 48:16.371
to fester like
that, it torches--

48:16.411 --> 48:17.571
- What?

48:17.611 --> 48:20.529
- If you hurt Farleigh
in any way at all,

48:20.570 --> 48:21.930
I will kill you.

48:27.331 --> 48:29.050
- [Jasper] Good night,
Dennis (grunts).

48:29.090 --> 48:32.451
(water splashing)

48:32.490 --> 48:35.090
(Jasper gasping)

48:38.690 --> 48:42.730
(slightly uneasy
electronic music)

48:55.050 --> 48:57.530
(door rattling)

49:00.530 --> 49:04.209
- I thought we might all go
see Jasper's uncle today.

49:04.250 --> 49:06.569
(clears throat)
It's beautiful out,

49:06.610 --> 49:09.369
good day for a visit,
don'tcha think?

49:11.969 --> 49:14.568
- What do you think
you are doing, Dennis?

49:14.609 --> 49:15.569
- Me?

49:17.009 --> 49:18.250
- He's taken ill.

49:19.689 --> 49:20.889
- Really.

49:20.929 --> 49:23.449
- Yes, pushing him in
the pool, excuse me!

49:23.489 --> 49:25.769
(Jasper sighs)

49:30.569 --> 49:32.169
How do you feel, my boy?

49:32.209 --> 49:34.768
- (groans) I didn't mean,

49:34.809 --> 49:37.249
(groans) didn't
mean to get so sick.

49:37.289 --> 49:39.049
I'm sorry if I ruined your day.

49:39.089 --> 49:41.048
- [Farleigh] It's
not your fault.

49:41.088 --> 49:43.369
We need to play it
very easy and slow,

49:43.408 --> 49:44.648
so we have you back on set

49:44.689 --> 49:46.728
as a normal,
functioning human being.

49:46.769 --> 49:47.928
- [Jasper] Yes, thank you.

49:47.968 --> 49:49.328
- [Farleigh] Yes.

49:49.369 --> 49:50.329
- Wow!

49:51.449 --> 49:53.808
(Jasper sighs)

49:57.528 --> 50:00.089
Well, someone ought
to enjoy the day.

50:00.128 --> 50:03.448
(rhythmic acoustic guitar)

50:14.088 --> 50:18.128
(Dennis speaking
foreign language)

50:24.287 --> 50:26.886
(Dennis sighs)

50:33.487 --> 50:34.207
(Dennis speaking
foreign language)

50:34.248 --> 50:35.127
- Allow me.

50:37.727 --> 50:40.688
My name is Peter,
care for a cigarette?

50:43.247 --> 50:44.207
- Gracias.

50:44.247 --> 50:47.527
(lighter flicking)

50:47.567 --> 50:50.046
(Dennis grunts)

50:51.287 --> 50:53.567
How did you know this
is just what I needed?

50:53.606 --> 50:55.167
- I've spent enough
time in Tangiers to know

50:55.207 --> 50:58.207
the look of a man
who needs tobacco.

50:58.247 --> 51:00.766
(Dennis laughs)

51:00.807 --> 51:02.727
- [Dennis] You spent
time in Tangiers?

51:02.767 --> 51:04.527
- That's one of those
places, you know?

51:04.567 --> 51:05.487
Hard to avoid.

51:07.527 --> 51:08.647
- Do you live around here?

51:08.686 --> 51:12.726
- Here, (clicks tongue)
I am just visiting.

51:21.726 --> 51:23.246
Do you have a lover?

51:24.206 --> 51:26.486
- I'm not sure anymore.

51:26.526 --> 51:29.686
- How's it that you aren't
sure you have a lover?

51:29.726 --> 51:32.166
One tends to have one or not.

51:34.686 --> 51:36.726
- Affairs of the heart.

51:36.766 --> 51:39.565
- This person is,
no doubt, a fool.

51:41.926 --> 51:43.726
- I think I'm the fool.

51:46.926 --> 51:48.286
- Life is cruel.

51:49.565 --> 51:51.085
- [Dennis] Hmm.

51:51.125 --> 51:54.765
- Hey, would you like to
see where I'm staying?

51:56.246 --> 51:57.206
- I would.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.126
- [Peter] It's a
delight to play host.

52:03.165 --> 52:05.005
- So, is this your place?

52:05.046 --> 52:06.485
- [Peter] In a way.

52:09.125 --> 52:10.565
- Why are you so vague?

52:10.605 --> 52:12.724
- [Peter] You're a charming guy,

52:12.765 --> 52:14.645
but I want to present
myself carefully.

52:14.685 --> 52:17.085
I would find it gross
to flaunt wealth

52:17.125 --> 52:19.085
or possessions in front of you.

52:19.125 --> 52:22.203
- I'm from Los Angeles where
that's a ritual mating call.

52:22.245 --> 52:25.285
- Wealth is so unimportant
in the long run.

52:25.325 --> 52:27.284
That's why I don't
want to play that game.

52:27.324 --> 52:30.044
- Only rich people say that.

52:30.084 --> 52:33.884
- (scoffs) Yeah, but maybe
they know it to be true.

52:35.004 --> 52:38.044
- And what, pray tell,
is more important?

52:38.765 --> 52:39.725
- Beauty,

52:40.684 --> 52:43.325
perhaps, if there is
such a thing, love.

52:43.364 --> 52:45.044
- You don't believe in love?

52:45.084 --> 52:47.763
- I think it's a bit like God.

52:47.804 --> 52:49.724
You'll never really know
he's real until you know.

52:49.764 --> 52:51.884
- And how do you know?

52:51.924 --> 52:52.924
- You meet him.

52:56.604 --> 52:59.284
(water splashing)

53:01.364 --> 53:03.844
(Dennis coughs)

53:04.964 --> 53:07.923
(tableware clanking)

53:10.923 --> 53:14.203
(Dennis sighs)

53:14.243 --> 53:18.043
I'd like you to stay, and
not just for the night.

53:19.124 --> 53:20.803
The one who is waiting,
does he love you?

53:25.043 --> 53:26.883
- I don't know anymore.

53:29.883 --> 53:31.323
- I could love you.

53:33.683 --> 53:34.723
Stay with me.

53:36.243 --> 53:38.283
Tomorrow, I have to take
care of some personal things

53:38.323 --> 53:42.363
in Cartagena, but after that,
we can stay here forever.

53:49.602 --> 53:50.562
but I can't.

53:56.403 --> 53:58.962
- Well, because
I still love him.

54:05.402 --> 54:09.442
(pleasant guitar over
dreamy electronic music)

54:22.081 --> 54:25.121
(waves gently crashing)

54:35.521 --> 54:38.401
(crickets chirping)

54:40.681 --> 54:41.761
- You back?

54:41.802 --> 54:43.161
- [Dennis] I am.

54:45.321 --> 54:46.281
Where is everybody?

54:46.321 --> 54:48.002
- Asleep, we'll all be going

54:48.041 --> 54:50.801
to Jasper's uncle
tomorrow morning.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.001
- We are?

54:57.321 --> 54:58.281
- Yes.

55:01.401 --> 55:02.680
He just wanted to cancel it,

55:02.721 --> 55:05.601
but I told him he can't do
that, that's very impolite.

55:05.641 --> 55:09.680
His uncle wouldn't stand for
such a thing, and me neither.

55:10.881 --> 55:13.280
- Sounds good, I'll
make sure to shave.

55:20.921 --> 55:23.599
(Farleigh sighs)

55:41.880 --> 55:44.319
(lips smacking)

55:59.079 --> 56:00.319
- You better go to sleep,

56:06.399 --> 56:07.919
- Aren't you coming?

56:08.839 --> 56:11.399
- Perhaps in a bit, I,

56:11.439 --> 56:13.639
I still have some work to do.

56:15.639 --> 56:17.999
(Dennis sighs)

56:21.719 --> 56:25.759
(distant siren blaring
over humming traffic)

56:28.479 --> 56:30.559
- [Javi] Are you sure this
is your uncle's neighborhood?

56:30.598 --> 56:32.919
- (sighs) I should've never
brought you guys here.

56:32.958 --> 56:34.438
I should've come on my own.

56:34.478 --> 56:35.639
- Under no circumstances

56:35.678 --> 56:37.039
would I have allowed
you to come here alone.

56:37.078 --> 56:39.398
- I would've been fine.

56:39.438 --> 56:41.518
- You would've been abducted!

56:41.559 --> 56:42.519
- If only!

56:49.438 --> 56:50.759
- [Farleigh] Here we go.

56:50.798 --> 56:53.798
- Does anybody see
this long-ass gun?

56:56.238 --> 56:59.758
(Enrique speaking
foreign language)

56:59.798 --> 57:02.678
(Farleigh speaking
foreign language)

57:02.718 --> 57:03.558
- Wh-what's his name?

57:03.598 --> 57:06.518
- Enrique, it's me, Jasper.

57:06.557 --> 57:10.198
(Enrique speaking
foreign language)

57:10.237 --> 57:12.757
- [Farleigh] So can we go, OK.

57:15.118 --> 57:16.798
(Enrique speaking
foreign language)

57:22.117 --> 57:23.437
- [Jasper] I want to, uh,
introduce you to my friends.

57:23.477 --> 57:25.637
This is Farleigh, Javi.
(group chattering)

57:25.677 --> 57:26.637
In the back is Dennis.

57:26.678 --> 57:27.518
- [Uncle] Have a seat.

57:27.557 --> 57:28.557
- [Farleigh] Thank you, gracias.

57:28.598 --> 57:29.957
- I didn't know you were
traveling with friends!

57:29.997 --> 57:31.317
- [Jasper] Si, si.

57:32.837 --> 57:36.117
- [Dennis] (clears throat) Hola.

57:36.157 --> 57:39.356
- [Peter] And I
welcome the unexpected.

57:41.677 --> 57:43.797
Please excuse the
dramatic arrival,

57:43.837 --> 57:47.677
but these days, one must
take extra precautions.

57:49.317 --> 57:51.237
- You're Peter Cardones.

57:53.397 --> 57:55.477
I recognize him from his work.

57:55.516 --> 57:57.316
He's one of the most influential
South American artists

57:57.357 --> 58:00.437
to have emerged since the 1990s.

58:00.476 --> 58:02.197
- You have quite
an educated eye.

58:02.236 --> 58:03.876
- His sculptures
and installations

58:03.916 --> 58:06.197
draw on architecture
and geography to explore

58:06.236 --> 58:08.517
the psychological, biological,

58:08.556 --> 58:11.596
and economic aspects
of urban oppression.

58:11.636 --> 58:13.556
- [Peter] Yeah, that's right.

58:13.597 --> 58:15.396
- [Farleigh] Well, he's
been to every major museum

58:15.436 --> 58:16.476
in the world, and so--

58:16.516 --> 58:19.476
- [Peter] So, what have
you been up to, my boy?

58:19.516 --> 58:21.356
- Ah, the question of the hour.

58:21.396 --> 58:22.636
- I, I've been designing.

58:22.676 --> 58:26.195
I'm even, uh, even going
to be on his TV show.

58:26.235 --> 58:27.675
- Hard Nock Design?

58:27.716 --> 58:29.596
- (chuckles) Well, uh,
didn't know I had a following

58:29.636 --> 58:32.196
in Colombia, thank
you, I'm flattered.

58:32.236 --> 58:36.195
- I don't think, uh, a
reality show is a great idea.

58:37.676 --> 58:40.756
- Oh, we are very excited
to have Jasper on board,

58:40.795 --> 58:42.956
to have him take the lead
on all of our project.

58:42.995 --> 58:45.115
- It's true, Tio, I mean, this,

58:45.155 --> 58:48.195
this show can change
my whole career.

58:48.235 --> 58:50.395
Eh, it's, the
exposure from a show

58:50.435 --> 58:52.276
like this, it's, it's priceless.

58:52.315 --> 58:54.955
- But you won that
big award at college!

58:54.995 --> 58:56.755
What was it called again?

58:56.795 --> 58:58.275
- You went to college?

58:58.315 --> 58:59.474
- I, I think that college

58:59.515 --> 59:00.835
might be overstating
it a little bit.

59:00.875 --> 59:02.355
- Overstating it?

59:03.635 --> 59:07.395
Jasper is a graduate from the
Rhode Island School of Design.

59:09.875 --> 59:11.475
- You went to RISD?

59:11.514 --> 59:14.035
- So you haven't
answered my questions.

59:14.075 --> 59:16.554
Why do you need to be on TV?

59:16.594 --> 59:18.794
- I want access to
a bigger clientele.

59:18.835 --> 59:22.474
A TV show is like, it's
like a big commercial.

59:23.754 --> 59:24.994
- Or a soap opera?

59:25.035 --> 59:29.035
- (chuckles) Sir, I
take offense on that.

59:30.594 --> 59:33.155
My TV show is as authentic
and artistic as your work,

59:33.794 --> 59:35.274
just in a different way.

59:35.314 --> 59:37.194
- I mean, Tio, I've tried
many avenues of work,

59:37.234 --> 59:39.754
but it's (sighs), I mean,
you know how difficult it is

59:39.794 --> 59:41.354
to get your material recognized.

59:41.394 --> 59:44.034
- Now that's the trouble
with your generation.

59:44.074 --> 59:47.153
You wanted instant
applause, instant approval.

59:47.194 --> 59:49.193
- Tio, it's like you and
your privileged friends

59:49.234 --> 59:51.193
worked very long before
you found success.

59:51.234 --> 59:53.753
- We changed this country.

59:53.794 --> 59:54.914
We showed passion--

59:54.954 --> 59:56.434
- But that's a luxury
where there is--

59:56.473 --> 59:59.434
- You have to show passion,
aggression, revolution!

59:59.474 --> 01:00:00.394
You are an artist!

01:00:00.434 --> 01:00:02.234
- If the world were upholstery,

01:00:02.273 --> 01:00:04.993
I'm just an interior
designer, that's it!

01:00:05.033 --> 01:00:06.593
(slap cracking)

01:00:06.633 --> 01:00:08.273
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:10.874
I must insist that you do
not put your hands on him.

01:00:10.913 --> 01:00:14.953
(tense and uneasy
electronic music)

01:00:40.193 --> 01:00:42.592
- You are being extremely rude!

01:00:44.033 --> 01:00:46.913
- You make my boy think he
can fuck his way to greatness?

01:00:46.952 --> 01:00:48.993
You are pathetic,
that's what you are!

01:00:49.032 --> 01:00:52.072
To fuck an old man is to
trade youth for possession,

01:00:57.192 --> 01:01:00.152
- I don't have to listen
to you, you are pathetic!

01:01:00.192 --> 01:01:01.152
You are

01:01:02.552 --> 01:01:03.992
an outdated cabron!

01:01:06.832 --> 01:01:10.232
- Not good enough for your
nephew, but good enough for me?

01:01:10.271 --> 01:01:14.072
(tense and uneasy
electronic music)

01:01:19.112 --> 01:01:21.791
- Because you are damaged,
you will never grow

01:01:21.831 --> 01:01:23.071
or know what love is.

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:24.792
- Beg your pardon?

01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:27.672
- I won't let my Jasper
get involved into this!

01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:29.592
He will not sleep
his way to the top!

01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:31.870
That's for whores,
that's for actors!

01:01:31.912 --> 01:01:33.871
- Javi, let's go.

01:01:33.911 --> 01:01:36.751
- Tio, you think you love
me, but you obviously don't.

01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:37.951
We have to go, Dennis.

01:01:37.991 --> 01:01:38.911
- Of course, I love you!

01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:40.830
- No, it's time to go, Dennis.

01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:43.351
- Listen, I gave up
my life to raise you.

01:01:43.391 --> 01:01:44.991
I let you fulfill your dreams!

01:01:45.031 --> 01:01:46.511
I let you go to America!

01:01:46.551 --> 01:01:47.271
- [Jasper] You let me?

01:01:47.311 --> 01:01:48.711
- Si, I let you!

01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:50.551
(shove thudding)

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:53.271
(punch thwacking)

01:01:55.431 --> 01:01:59.471
(men grunting over tense
and uneasy acoustic guitar)

01:02:00.831 --> 01:02:01.671
- Let's go!

01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:06.670
(gun cocking)

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:09.590
- Get your faggot
asses out of here!

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:18.630
- [Farleigh] It's a
Philippe Starck lamp!

01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:20.390
- [All] Go, go, go, go!

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:21.870
- [Javi] Run (groans).

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:24.229
- [Farleigh] It's a piece
of art, don't shoot!

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:26.750
(men chattering in
foreign language)

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:29.430
- [Dennis] This
is nuts (groans)!

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:30.950
(taxi driver speaking
in foreign language)

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.230
- [Javi] Go, go, go!

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.870
(all chattering over
tense acoustic guitar)

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:35.869
- Let's go, let's go, come on!

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:38.310
- What in goddamn hell was that?

01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:39.630
What in goddamn hell was that,

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:40.470
you could've gotten us killed!

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:41.750
- I know, I'm sorry!

01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:43.510
- And not only did you
put us all in danger,

01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:44.470
you're a liar!

01:02:44.509 --> 01:02:46.790
- I know, I'm a complete shit.

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:48.229
- Why deny your past,

01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:50.230
there's nothing to
be embarrassed of.

01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:52.029
- I didn't deny anything!

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:53.469
I came in here in
street clothes,

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:54.910
and you start
speaking Spanish to me

01:02:54.949 --> 01:02:56.150
and creating this story, OK?

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:57.909
I just didn't correct you!

01:02:57.949 --> 01:02:59.629
- I didn't need a story.

01:02:59.669 --> 01:03:02.469
- [Jasper] You wouldn't have
let me on TV without a story.

01:03:02.509 --> 01:03:03.509
- I would have.

01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:05.949
- [Jasper] But the
producers wouldn't have.

01:03:05.989 --> 01:03:10.029
(Jasper sighing and gasping)

01:03:10.669 --> 01:03:11.669
- Come on, my boy.

01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:15.989
I know it's not
your fault, I know.

01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:18.268
Everything will be fine now.

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:20.949
He can't hurt you anymore, huh?

01:03:20.988 --> 01:03:23.748
Huh?
(Jasper groaning)

01:03:32.228 --> 01:03:34.269
- I can't believe this happened!

01:03:34.308 --> 01:03:36.189
Have your bags
packed by seven a.m.,

01:03:36.228 --> 01:03:37.588
the water boat will be here,

01:03:37.628 --> 01:03:39.708
and if you're not down
at breakfast by six,

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.588
you do not get a fruit cup!

01:03:41.628 --> 01:03:44.187
(dramatic piano)

01:04:04.148 --> 01:04:06.747
(cane tapping)

01:04:23.347 --> 01:04:24.187
(picture cracks on counter)

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:28.267
(motorbike engine sputtering)

01:04:28.987 --> 01:04:30.067
(dog yawning)

01:04:30.106 --> 01:04:33.747
(expressive but
pleasant ambient music)

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:41.506
- How's the eye?

01:04:41.547 --> 01:04:43.787
- (sighs) It's fine.

01:04:43.826 --> 01:04:44.786
Jerk.

01:04:45.587 --> 01:04:46.547
- Excuse me?

01:04:48.906 --> 01:04:51.946
- I saw you laugh
when I got punched.

01:04:51.986 --> 01:04:53.986
- It was funny,

01:04:54.026 --> 01:04:55.426
and long overdue.

01:04:55.467 --> 01:04:56.987
- It was your fault.

01:05:01.706 --> 01:05:04.265
(couch creaking)

01:05:10.946 --> 01:05:13.546
(urine bubbling)

01:05:17.066 --> 01:05:20.546
(expressive acoustic guitar)

01:05:23.026 --> 01:05:26.225
- I'm gonna shower,
wash off the grime.

01:05:27.666 --> 01:05:31.106
(rhythmic electronic music)

01:05:33.585 --> 01:05:36.425
- Brittny, hi, it's Dennis.

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:39.465
I need to borrow your
hotel room at 6:30.

01:05:39.506 --> 01:05:41.105
No, you guys can't be there.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:45.185
I need to show Farleigh the
parasite that Jasper really is.

01:05:47.264 --> 01:05:48.665
He hasn't seen what I've seen.

01:05:48.705 --> 01:05:51.505
(shower hissing)

01:05:51.545 --> 01:05:52.505
Hey.

01:05:56.505 --> 01:05:59.705
I called Nate Berkus, he's gonna
cover the show with Gordon.

01:05:59.744 --> 01:06:01.985
- [Farleigh] Ah,
no, not him (sighs).

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.024
- Don't be mad.

01:06:04.265 --> 01:06:07.145
The girls invited
us to their hotel.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:12.304
Jasper and I are gonna meet
them for a sunset cocktail.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:14.704
I don't care if I
lose everything,

01:06:14.745 --> 01:06:16.225
I don't care if I lose Farleigh,

01:06:21.984 --> 01:06:23.704
I'm not gonna see Farleigh hurt.

01:06:23.744 --> 01:06:25.064
- [Farleigh] You're
going with Jasper?

01:06:25.104 --> 01:06:27.024
- I'm trying to be nice.

01:06:29.584 --> 01:06:31.184
- [Farleigh] It becomes you.

01:06:31.224 --> 01:06:33.224
- And leave us some tequila.

01:06:33.264 --> 01:06:34.983
Remember, seven sharp!

01:06:38.664 --> 01:06:42.703
Ready to go, I told the
girls I'd meet them early.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:47.143
- What about Farleigh?

01:06:47.184 --> 01:06:48.744
- They'll meet us.

01:06:57.743 --> 01:06:58.703
(rapping on door)

01:06:58.743 --> 01:06:59.984
Brittny, Heather?

01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:08.903
(door rattling)

01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:11.143
Guess they're running late.

01:07:11.183 --> 01:07:12.782
- Should we go
back to the lobby?

01:07:12.823 --> 01:07:14.343
- Oh, look, tequila!

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.343
(Jasper sighs)

01:07:28.383 --> 01:07:30.743
They said meet 'em for a drink.

01:07:32.262 --> 01:07:35.582
- I, I don't know I should
be drinking their tequila.

01:07:36.662 --> 01:07:39.783
(liquid sloshing)

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:42.902
(Jasper snickers)

01:07:42.943 --> 01:07:45.902
(Jasper gasps and coughs)

01:07:45.942 --> 01:07:48.302
It's good, it's strong.

01:07:48.342 --> 01:07:52.102
(quiet and airy ambient music)

01:07:56.582 --> 01:07:57.982
- Since we've found
ourselves alone,

01:07:58.022 --> 01:08:00.101
I suppose I'll say my piece.

01:08:03.182 --> 01:08:06.981
(clicks tongue) I want
to ask your forgiveness.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:09.782
- Excuse me.

01:08:09.822 --> 01:08:12.102
- I've treated you horribly.

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:16.542
- I, I, I wouldn't say that
you've treated me horribly.

01:08:16.581 --> 01:08:18.862
- I have, it's just, you know,

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:24.020
I'm jealous (chuckles).

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.142
- Y-you're jealous of me?

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.461
- Your beauty,
your intelligence.

01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:32.301
- Um, well, Dennis, this
stuff about RISD, I--

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.861
- Hey, I think that's
cool, it sounds fun.

01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:38.701
Wish I did college (scoffs).

01:08:38.741 --> 01:08:40.261
Maybe then Farleigh
and I could communicate

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.581
the way you two do.

01:08:41.621 --> 01:08:44.581
(distant chattering)

01:08:49.261 --> 01:08:51.700
Woo (scoffs),

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.540
Don't wanna ruin my
shirt before dinner.

01:09:07.701 --> 01:09:11.300
- Yeah, it's nice
(clears throat).

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:19.420
- I suppose I should just
come out with it already.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.859
I'm stepping aside.

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:29.419
Farleigh clearly loves
you, and you him.

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.698
- I, I don't think that you,
that you understand, Dennis.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.698
- No, I do, I do, it's fine.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:38.140
Seriously, it's fine.

01:09:38.179 --> 01:09:40.578
Farleigh and I had a great run.

01:09:42.499 --> 01:09:46.538
(laughs) What's funny is
it's just I'm beginning

01:09:47.658 --> 01:09:49.698
to understand what
Farleigh sees in you.

01:09:49.738 --> 01:09:51.859
I can't help but
see it for myself.

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:55.939
(rhythmic, quietly
tense percussion)

01:09:58.539 --> 01:10:01.539
I suppose after all
this time, I'm...

01:10:03.138 --> 01:10:04.859
a little bit in
love with you, too.

01:10:09.819 --> 01:10:12.618
- I can't believe
you just said that.

01:10:13.698 --> 01:10:16.379
What time is
Farleigh coming back?

01:10:17.578 --> 01:10:18.538
- 7:30.

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:25.418
(Jasper panting)

01:10:27.418 --> 01:10:31.258
(energetic thumping percussion)

01:10:38.938 --> 01:10:41.537
(belts jingling)

01:10:45.578 --> 01:10:48.058
(lips smacking)

01:10:49.937 --> 01:10:52.858
(Jasper panting)

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:02.697
(lips smacking)

01:11:04.018 --> 01:11:05.577
Slow down, slow down!

01:11:05.617 --> 01:11:07.978
Slow down, slow down!
- Why, why?

01:11:08.017 --> 01:11:09.337
- Slow down!

01:11:09.377 --> 01:11:10.458
- I don't wanna slow down.

01:11:10.497 --> 01:11:13.577
(rhythmic percussion)

01:11:18.297 --> 01:11:22.336
(both moaning over
energetic hand claps)

01:11:39.176 --> 01:11:41.696
(lips smacking)

01:11:55.096 --> 01:11:58.256
(expressive vocal choir)

01:12:11.135 --> 01:12:13.696
(Jasper sighing)

01:12:18.616 --> 01:12:20.735
- This is, um, unexpected.

01:12:21.975 --> 01:12:25.935
- (chuckles) You could say that.

01:12:28.055 --> 01:12:29.775
- What about Farleigh?

01:12:30.855 --> 01:12:32.855
- What about Farleigh?

01:12:32.896 --> 01:12:34.495
- You were after him.

01:12:35.855 --> 01:12:38.095
- Farleigh has to be,
what, 50 years old?

01:12:38.135 --> 01:12:40.495
I'm not after Farleigh.

01:12:40.535 --> 01:12:42.775
- But that night,
after the party,

01:12:42.815 --> 01:12:44.855
Farleigh spent the night.

01:12:46.214 --> 01:12:50.095
- He spent the night, it's
not like he didn't try, but,

01:12:54.054 --> 01:12:54.975
- I'm the one you want?

01:12:55.014 --> 01:12:55.935
- Yes.

01:12:55.974 --> 01:12:56.934
- Why?

01:12:58.854 --> 01:13:02.655
- Because every time I'm with
you, my heart goes crazy.

01:13:05.734 --> 01:13:07.855
- My plan was to ruin you.

01:13:11.094 --> 01:13:13.495
(Jasper sighs)

01:13:17.094 --> 01:13:19.214
Get dressed, get dressed.

01:13:19.254 --> 01:13:20.254
- What?

01:13:21.174 --> 01:13:24.574
- Farleigh's gonna
be here any minute.

01:13:24.614 --> 01:13:28.654
(water bubbling over
pleasant ambient music)

01:13:55.773 --> 01:13:56.613
Jasper and I--

01:14:02.413 --> 01:14:03.892
- Why?

01:14:03.933 --> 01:14:06.333
- Because I did it to hurt you.

01:14:14.653 --> 01:14:15.613
- Jealous.

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:19.013
- I wish you had
ever looked at me

01:14:19.053 --> 01:14:22.333
the way I've seen
you look at him.

01:14:22.372 --> 01:14:24.492
- But I don't love Jasper.

01:14:26.252 --> 01:14:27.413
- The first time he
came to our place,

01:14:27.452 --> 01:14:29.812
I knew I would lose you to him.

01:14:31.612 --> 01:14:33.692
- Then why did you hire him?

01:14:36.292 --> 01:14:40.212
- Because I thought I
could still have him first.

01:14:41.172 --> 01:14:43.372
- I'm not ready to leave you.

01:14:45.452 --> 01:14:46.292
I love you.

01:14:49.172 --> 01:14:51.292
- I know, and I loved you.

01:14:55.332 --> 01:14:56.492
I do love you.

01:14:58.731 --> 01:14:59.691
You know,

01:15:05.412 --> 01:15:09.252
(scoffs) people
always told me that

01:15:09.291 --> 01:15:11.331
I was a fool to keep you.

01:15:15.131 --> 01:15:17.971
But, um, I was the young boy

01:15:18.011 --> 01:15:19.931
who could not grow up, I

01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:29.971
(Farleigh laughs)

01:15:31.931 --> 01:15:34.330
(water splashing)

01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:38.411
(unsettling and ominous
electronic music)

01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:41.851
(slaps cracking)

01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:46.490
Hey!

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:51.371
(unsettling and ominous
electronic music)

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:54.490
Javi, can you call,
uh, 911, please?

01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:58.570
(uneasy pulsing
electronic tones)

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:14.650
(pleasant but vaguely
uneasy ambient music)

01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:21.890
- What you wanna hit, is
desire, in season six--

01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:25.689
(voices become muffled and airy)

01:16:25.729 --> 01:16:27.850
Shut, shut the fuck
up for a second.

01:16:27.889 --> 01:16:29.929
Remember that it's
designed for life

01:16:29.969 --> 01:16:31.889
and no, this isn't art.

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:35.449
I cared about Farleigh
as much as anybody,

01:16:35.489 --> 01:16:38.729
so just give me a
smile, something to, OK.

01:16:42.489 --> 01:16:43.449
You good?

01:16:43.489 --> 01:16:44.289
- Si.

01:16:44.329 --> 01:16:45.409
(door alarm beeping)

01:16:45.449 --> 01:16:46.409
- Here we go.

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:50.289
(crowd chattering)

01:16:50.329 --> 01:16:52.529
I don't know why they have,

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:55.889
this has happened so many times.

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:01.409
I beg your pardon.

01:17:02.568 --> 01:17:06.209
(crowd chattering over
uneasy acoustic guitar)

01:17:29.368 --> 01:17:30.448
- Been inside?

01:17:30.488 --> 01:17:32.607
- I have, it's a madhouse.

01:17:34.328 --> 01:17:36.408
I hear they're giving
your boy Jasper the show.

01:17:36.447 --> 01:17:39.128
Out with the old,
in with the new.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.648
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

01:17:41.687 --> 01:17:43.768
(horns honking)

01:17:43.808 --> 01:17:45.687
So how's life in probate?

01:17:45.728 --> 01:17:48.208
- I have to find a
new place to live.

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:50.207
- [Paulette] I thought
he left you everything?

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:52.566
- Farleigh was up to
his eyeballs in debt.

01:17:52.608 --> 01:17:55.287
It's no wonder he was
wanting me to get a job.

01:17:55.328 --> 01:17:57.288
- Did you get anything?

01:17:57.327 --> 01:17:59.527
- Couple hundred thousand.

01:17:59.567 --> 01:18:02.247
Stashed it away in
some sort of trust.

01:18:02.287 --> 01:18:04.127
- See, he did love you!

01:18:09.847 --> 01:18:11.647
What are you going
to do with it?

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:15.487
- I applied to college, I
wanna teach art history.

01:18:16.887 --> 01:18:19.607
- Good for you, you
always were the smart one.

01:18:19.646 --> 01:18:22.887
(horns honking)

01:18:22.927 --> 01:18:24.445
How's the kid doing?

01:18:24.486 --> 01:18:26.806
- He keeps leaving messages.

01:18:28.046 --> 01:18:30.727
I can't return the calls,

01:18:30.766 --> 01:18:34.686
but I can't just seem to
delete the messages, either.

01:18:34.727 --> 01:18:37.286
- You are smitten, I can tell.

01:18:37.327 --> 01:18:39.566
- Don't tell Lonnie, OK?

01:18:39.606 --> 01:18:41.486
He thinks I love him.

01:18:41.526 --> 01:18:44.406
(Paulette chuckles)

01:18:44.446 --> 01:18:47.326
- [Paulette] Come
on, it's starting.

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:53.886
Hey, you don't have to do this.

01:18:57.086 --> 01:18:59.526
Come on, lemme take you home.

01:19:04.766 --> 01:19:07.245
- [Javi] Damn, the fuck is this?

01:19:09.085 --> 01:19:12.126
- I've watched you
do this for 10 years.

01:19:13.845 --> 01:19:14.925
Trust me.

01:19:14.965 --> 01:19:18.326
(pleasant acoustic guitar)

01:19:25.325 --> 01:19:27.805
I can't help but feeling guilty.

01:19:33.125 --> 01:19:37.045
- We've been through this,
it wasn't your fault.

01:19:37.085 --> 01:19:40.285
- I didn't want all
this, not without him,

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.845
and yet, here I am.

01:19:49.165 --> 01:19:52.045
(envelope rustling)

01:19:59.244 --> 01:20:02.564
(pleasant acoustic guitar)

01:20:03.804 --> 01:20:06.284
- Farleigh left me the,
the deed to the house?

01:20:06.324 --> 01:20:08.524
- No, I'm giving it to you.

01:20:10.124 --> 01:20:12.004
- You don't want it?

01:20:12.044 --> 01:20:15.963
- It's a mausoleum now,
it was always Farleigh's.

01:20:20.804 --> 01:20:22.044
I know you want it,

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:25.924
you and Farleigh built
this house together.

01:20:30.963 --> 01:20:32.723
- [Javi] We have
history you know.

01:20:32.764 --> 01:20:36.123
(pleasant acoustic guitar)

01:20:44.283 --> 01:20:45.363
(Javi gasps)

01:20:45.403 --> 01:20:48.803
(pleasant ambient music)

01:21:02.403 --> 01:21:05.082
(Dennis sniffles)

01:21:06.882 --> 01:21:09.843
(footsteps clacking)

01:21:15.962 --> 01:21:19.762
(water bubbling over
relaxed folk rock music)

01:21:32.002 --> 01:21:33.042
- I miss you.

01:21:34.802 --> 01:21:37.722
(wine bubbling)

01:21:37.762 --> 01:21:41.000
(relaxed folk rock music)

01:21:48.681 --> 01:21:50.722
- [Jasper] There you are.

01:21:53.602 --> 01:21:57.521
I was hoping I'd at least
get to see you tonight.

01:21:59.202 --> 01:22:00.842
- I'm sorry I left.

01:22:03.482 --> 01:22:06.681
- Well, meanwhile, the network
wants to replace Farleigh

01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:13.761
- Javi's looking
for a new pool boy.

01:22:16.481 --> 01:22:20.281
- You know, Dennis, you weren't
the only one that loved him.

01:22:32.921 --> 01:22:34.601
- I got you something,

01:22:44.201 --> 01:22:46.880
(water splashing)

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.640
- What?

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.840
- A job, I convinced
the producers

01:23:03.039 --> 01:23:05.560
to keep you on as
Nate's assistant.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:09.520
It's not much, but it's
better than pool boy wages.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.520
- Dennis.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.160
- Yes.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.399
- (sighs) I love you.

01:23:19.679 --> 01:23:22.439
- You don't understand love.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.879
- I, but I mean it.

01:23:28.559 --> 01:23:30.199
- Hold your breath.

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:32.999
