00:02.044 --> 00:03.910
<i>Previously on</i>
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:04.003 --> 00:06.291
Aunt Lydia, may I go home,
please?

00:06.381 --> 00:10.216
You may go home when your walking partner
goes home.

00:10.302 --> 00:12.259
You and the Commander
tried to have children?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.258
I wanted to.
He disagreed.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.215
<i>They were always
adjusting my dosage.</i>

00:17.309 --> 00:18.675
I wish we could've.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.039
<i>- Once Nichole's returned...</i>
- I love you.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.183
<i>...we'd do our best to move
the others along quickly.</i>

00:23.273 --> 00:25.014
So much leverage
comes from the child.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.692
With her back home...

00:26.777 --> 00:27.921
You want me to
keep her there.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.402
Just for a bit.

00:29.488 --> 00:30.488
You're not well.

00:30.614 --> 00:31.614
- No.
- June.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.821
You're out of your mind.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.330
I can help you. You'd never have
to go back to Gilead again.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.452
Do you really think that
I would leave my home?

00:42.751 --> 00:43.751
My offer still stands.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.539
<i>Treason and coconuts.</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:48.292
I probably won't see
my daughters again.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.291
She's someone's child, too.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.469
I honor the Handmaid's life
by saving her child's.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.341
How will you honor
your daughters?

00:56.765 --> 01:01.305
I don't know how yet, but I'm gonna
get out as many children as I can.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.137
<i>They all deserve to be free.</i>

Ofjoseph. Ofjoseph.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.890
Okay, Ofjoseph.

01:43.145 --> 01:46.229
Almost there now.
One step at a time, dear.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.522
Almost there.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.735
Blessed day.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.948
Thank you.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.035
Blessed be the fruit.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.078
May the Lord open.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.671
Ofjoseph, you need
to get rest today.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.841
You can go straight upstairs
to your room and take a snooze.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.508
- Thank you, Aunt Lydia.
- Mmm.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.961
<i>But I don't want rest.</i>

02:20.098 --> 02:21.430
<i>I don't want to rest
ever again.</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:22.600
Oh!

02:23.727 --> 02:24.727
Oh!

02:25.479 --> 02:28.472
Well, isn't this a delight?

02:30.567 --> 02:31.899
The Lawrences
redecorated.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.399
All households
doing their best to conform

02:35.572 --> 02:38.235
to Commander Waterford's
new regulations.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.869
Every residence elevated
to D.C. standards.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.244
I suppose you've missed a few things
in your time away.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.329
Mmm. Suppose I have.

02:50.545 --> 02:55.210
Perhaps God will deem this household
worthy of a child after all,

02:56.051 --> 02:59.670
should he forgive us for taking you
away from last month's Ceremony.

03:01.139 --> 03:04.632
Happily, we've returned you
just in time for the next.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.103
I believe that
my time of prayer

03:13.193 --> 03:15.105
has led me to see
my true purpose.

03:16.988 --> 03:22.359
Oh. You are a good girl,
Ofjoseph.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.451
Go on. I'll let you
get settled. Hmm?

03:52.274 --> 03:53.640
Scones mean no.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.563
Welcome home.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.446
"Scones mean no"?

03:58.989 --> 04:00.400
A message from the network.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.694
No more medication
for Eleanor.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.030
I've asked everyone
I can think of.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.741
When they can't help,
they send scones.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.706
She's getting worse?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.204
She throws things now.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.958
- Beth...
- Hmm?

04:24.055 --> 04:25.975
I need you to ask the Marthas
for something else.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.140
Of course you do.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.680
Do you know anyone who could
help me move children out?

04:38.695 --> 04:40.027
I'm gonna get them out.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.657
I know how it sounds.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.238
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.842
I said
I didn't want it.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.872
- They can bring you something else.
- I'm not hungry!

05:12.896 --> 05:14.136
Eleanor, sweetheart...

05:14.189 --> 05:15.930
No,
just leave me alone!

05:16.066 --> 05:18.044
- Eleanor...
- Don't you touch me! Get out!

05:18.068 --> 05:19.730
Get out!

05:19.820 --> 05:21.436
Go! Get out of here!

05:36.419 --> 05:37.751
Welcome home.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.671
Thank you, sir.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.026
Reorganizing, sir?

06:02.821 --> 06:03.902
Hmm.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.862
Beth told me she can't get any more
of her medication.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.207
I would appreciate it
if you would give my wife her privacy.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.960
Well, I'm just worried.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.373
You really think
she's safe here?

06:23.466 --> 06:25.332
Of course she's safe.
This is...

06:26.303 --> 06:27.669
It's her home.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.320
You can't keep her
locked up here forever.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.761
What do you
propose I do?

06:36.563 --> 06:38.646
I'm not
sending my wife away.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.155
You can leave Gilead
with her.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.531
Get a truck.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.749
Get her out.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.956
And get her the help
that she needs.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.936
She cannot
go on like this.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.821
What do you know about
how much someone can take?

07:45.799 --> 07:46.960
Everything.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.602
<i>He's scared.</i>

08:08.738 --> 08:10.195
<i>Fear can be a great motivator.</i>

08:20.542 --> 08:22.499
<i>Another walking partner dead.</i>

08:23.420 --> 08:24.911
<i>They must think I'm cursed.</i>

08:27.048 --> 08:28.289
<i>Or a terrorist.</i>

08:29.718 --> 08:30.718
<i>I'm not, though.</i>

08:32.261 --> 08:33.261
<i>Not yet.</i>

08:52.949 --> 08:54.360
I need your help.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.029
I can't help.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.152
They're watching
everything we do.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.993
And you're
really conspicuous.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.304
How many Handmaids' kids
are still in this district?

09:18.933 --> 09:20.299
Can you find out?

09:20.727 --> 09:21.727
Why?

09:22.604 --> 09:24.220
Because I'm gonna
get them out.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.348
And a lot of them.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.487
You'll get put on the wall
just for thinking that.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.908
Are you okay?

09:37.285 --> 09:40.574
No. I am not fucking okay.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.917
Inspection?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.086
Another one.

09:54.511 --> 09:58.755
- Let's go, girls! Let's go! Hurry up!
- Move! Quick!

09:58.848 --> 09:59.848
Faster!

10:00.517 --> 10:01.928
To your places!

10:02.102 --> 10:04.765
Find your spot,
then be still.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.105
All the ways!

10:06.189 --> 10:08.181
Quickly, girls!
Move it! Move it!

10:09.192 --> 10:10.774
This is not a parade.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.567
Don't leave any spaces.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.113
Move over!

10:14.364 --> 10:16.321
Make it even.
Even spacing.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.068
All the way up!
All the way to the top, girls!

10:20.662 --> 10:22.278
Back row, no talking!

10:22.372 --> 10:23.783
You two, not so close.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.956
Up those stairs!
Up those stairs!

10:26.126 --> 10:27.412
Quiet, now.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.913
Heads down.
Hands in front.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.963
Excellent. We want you
looking your best

10:37.053 --> 10:39.636
for our
very special visitors.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.254
Blessed be the fruit.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.513
Mmm-hmm.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.892
You're looking well.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.603
Thank you, sir.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.562
Sorry to keep you
out here in the cold.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.273
I'm fine.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.604
Yes.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.444
A Boston girl,

11:42.535 --> 11:43.571
born and bred.

11:44.913 --> 11:45.913
Hardy.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.535
It's much warmer in D.C.

11:51.127 --> 11:55.337
I may be able to arrange a transfer
for you there,

11:56.758 --> 11:58.090
if you prefer.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.802
Your wife is here.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.199
Aunt Lydia will answer any questions
that you might have.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.637
We are honored to
have you, Commander.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.944
May God bless our endeavor.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.521
Shall we?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.837
I'm curious to see
what you have here.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.477
Your girls have
quite a reputation.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.782
Blessed be the fruit.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.993
May the Lord open.

12:33.503 --> 12:36.496
I think you'll be pleased
with the progress we've made

12:36.589 --> 12:37.921
since the Calhoun incident.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.583
And two more
confirmed pregnancies.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.301
True miracles, indeed.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.175
This is not regulation.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.805
Ofhoward's alterations were damaged
through criminal actions,

12:53.898 --> 12:56.561
and we decided
to make an allowance.

12:56.651 --> 12:57.836
You're comfortable with that

12:57.860 --> 13:00.398
in a district that has
fostered violent rebellion?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.443
I am,
Commander, at present.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.192
The veil. The ring.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.423
We're rolling it out slowly.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.908
And the vow is voluntary,
of course.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.685
We hold the devotion

13:12.709 --> 13:14.701
of veiled Handmaids
to the highest esteem.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.834
Praise be.

13:15.878 --> 13:16.939
How are you feeling?

13:16.963 --> 13:18.482
We'll continue
to encourage their good work.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.506
I'm fine.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.735
Oferic has
faithfully served Commander Simon

13:21.759 --> 13:23.362
- for nearly a year.
- Thank you.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.002
She is a model Handmaid.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.991
And how do you find
Commander Simon?

13:27.015 --> 13:28.993
- I am grateful to be in his service.
- How's your arm?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.857
So young. We'll get
a lot of mileage out of that one.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.362
George,
you remember Ofjoseph?

13:34.939 --> 13:37.522
Of course.
Joseph Lawrence is an old friend.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.974
Is he?

13:39.235 --> 13:42.524
Yes.
Golf buddies, from before.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.196
Every Sunday after church.
Always...

13:45.783 --> 13:47.194
always an experience.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.978
How do you find
Commander Lawrence?

13:53.583 --> 13:55.040
He treats me
with respect, sir.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.160
Respect?

14:02.467 --> 14:03.958
I am grateful to
be in his service.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.844
Good.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.343
Thank you.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.546
Hmm.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.737
Where is he?

14:29.952 --> 14:32.444
- He's at work.
- He goes to meetings now.

15:26.259 --> 15:30.629
All I want
is the TASCHEN <i>Gauguin.</i>

15:30.972 --> 15:33.931
He hides things just to bother me,
I swear to God.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.726
Ha!

15:38.771 --> 15:39.771
Hi.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.310
Hi.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.771
What are you doing?

15:47.405 --> 15:48.941
You're up to
something again.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.445
What is it?

15:54.537 --> 15:55.778
Is it your daughter?

15:58.791 --> 15:59.998
No.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.419
Hannah's gone.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.252
Well, tell me what
you're doing in here.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.423
I'm looking for
other people's children.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.130
My friends' children.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.888
You mean Handmaids?

16:21.481 --> 16:22.597
Yes.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.558
I'm trying to find out
where they are.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.441
That information is in
The Red Center dossiers.

16:35.745 --> 16:36.745
Right.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.532
Joseph keeps them
in the basement.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.298
Let's go!
I don't have all day.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.059
They keep sending them
for him to review.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.272
He just sticks them down here.
Like we need any more clutter.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.484
Oh! This place is a mess.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.402
What is the point of having
as many maids as you want

17:14.492 --> 17:17.484
if they aren't allowed
to actually clean anything?

17:25.086 --> 17:28.124
Joseph likes
to keep them...

17:29.632 --> 17:31.749
"Of labor resources."

17:32.969 --> 17:34.176
Here they are!

18:10.256 --> 18:11.372
Aha.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.877
Oh!

18:29.859 --> 18:31.100
Where is that...

19:10.816 --> 19:12.648
- Mrs. Lawrence?
- Hmm?

19:12.735 --> 19:14.647
Have you ever thought
about leaving Gilead?

19:16.280 --> 19:19.648
You mean go somewhere
where I could get mood stabilizers

19:19.742 --> 19:21.449
instead of herbal tea?

19:23.371 --> 19:24.657
Joseph would help you.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.665
You could leave together.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.794
He wants you to be... safe.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.719
He loves you so much.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.055
Joseph is a war criminal.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.981
He can't cross the border.

20:00.449 --> 20:04.363
He would be jailed
for the rest of his life.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.494
Or killed.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.289
And he would deserve it.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.132
Oh, I've been
looking for this!

20:19.218 --> 20:21.050
Oh!

20:21.470 --> 20:25.635
Oh! Oh, I'm so glad
you're back, Ofjoseph.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.263
Things are always so much more exciting
when you're here.

20:34.024 --> 20:37.108
After the bombing last year, we weren't sure
the district would ever recover.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.857
Our community
is very resilient, by His hand.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.718
If only the fringe cities

20:42.742 --> 20:45.029
would be so quick to
get their houses in order.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.078
Has there been pushback
on the new policies elsewhere?

20:52.001 --> 20:53.913
Some men are
set in their ways.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.000
Very true.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.051
Once Gilead is
finally recognized as a sovereign state,

21:03.137 --> 21:06.801
we won't have time to indulge
with those clinging to old habits.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.806
Is there someone in particular
that you're concerned with, Fred?

21:12.813 --> 21:14.145
I...

21:15.441 --> 21:16.773
I hesitate to say.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.691
I'd like to hear.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.742
Commander Lawrence.

21:34.084 --> 21:38.294
Lawrence's contributions
to Gilead have been substantial.

21:38.881 --> 21:39.997
At first.

21:40.925 --> 21:45.260
Now, I fear his influence
does more harm than good.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.346
Oh?

21:46.430 --> 21:47.949
He's made some
cosmetic changes

21:47.973 --> 21:49.714
to his household,
yes, but...

21:51.852 --> 21:53.718
He's had four Handmaids.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.688
Not one has produced.

21:58.734 --> 22:03.775
And from what I've seen
from his current Ofjoseph,

22:05.241 --> 22:07.528
that lack of discipline
persists.

22:07.618 --> 22:11.453
We may need to
set an example.

22:19.505 --> 22:22.623
Challenging someone like Lawrence is
a delicate business, Fred.

22:24.510 --> 22:27.048
I'm only suggesting

22:27.137 --> 22:30.972
we make certain that
he and his household

22:31.058 --> 22:34.927
are abiding by Gilead's
most sacred tenets.

22:37.606 --> 22:42.101
There are mechanisms in place

22:42.194 --> 22:45.562
to ensure virility.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.607
Isn't that a little extreme?

22:51.078 --> 22:54.446
If he's unfit to lead his household,
he's unfit to lead Gilead.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.459
Praise be.

23:16.604 --> 23:19.893
<i>It's been five years since
we had our children torn away from us.</i>

23:21.358 --> 23:23.270
<i>An eternity.</i>

23:24.737 --> 23:26.069
<i>They were one.</i>

23:27.823 --> 23:29.280
<i>Now they're six.</i>

23:32.411 --> 23:33.777
<i>They were seven.</i>

23:36.665 --> 23:37.872
<i>Now they're 12.</i>

23:42.630 --> 23:44.337
<i>We've missed everything.</i>

23:47.384 --> 23:48.465
<i>The steps.</i>

23:48.969 --> 23:50.130
<i>The smiles.</i>

23:52.389 --> 23:53.425
<i>The tragedies.</i>

23:55.309 --> 23:56.390
<i>Children still die.</i>

23:58.395 --> 23:59.395
<i>Even in Gilead.</i>

24:00.564 --> 24:02.146
<i>Janine's son, Caleb,</i>

24:03.317 --> 24:04.649
<i>four years ago.</i>

24:06.654 --> 24:09.146
<i>Prayers can't stop car accidents.</i>

24:10.824 --> 24:12.031
Ofjoseph?

24:16.538 --> 24:18.029
They want you
in the sitting room.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.071
Um...

25:36.035 --> 25:38.197
You both should stand
over there.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.975
What a lovely room.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.207
I pray that nothing will
impede God's will tonight.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.349
Come in.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.809
Eleanor.
Such a pleasure to see you.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.312
How are Olivia
and the kids?

26:55.405 --> 26:56.612
Couldn't be better.

26:56.824 --> 26:58.565
Shall I get you a drink,
George?

26:58.659 --> 27:00.776
I'll help myself, Joseph.
Thank you.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.954
We sincerely apologize
for intruding.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.623
No, no.
The more the merrier.

27:08.502 --> 27:12.337
In bearing witness, we pray with you
for a fruitful outcome.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.003
<i>They used to do this
in the first months of Gilead</i>

27:16.093 --> 27:18.506
<i>to the households that
resisted the Ceremony.</i>

27:19.930 --> 27:21.717
<i>They declared it unnecessary.</i>

27:23.225 --> 27:24.386
<i>Things change.</i>

27:24.643 --> 27:27.431
The Aunt checked
on us before.

27:27.521 --> 27:30.810
Oh, it's mere formality,
Mrs. Lawrence.

27:31.775 --> 27:36.895
Shoring up those households that
have had difficulties with Handmaids.

27:37.614 --> 27:41.278
Bearing witness ensures that
every member of the family

27:41.785 --> 27:43.026
is performing their role.

27:43.954 --> 27:47.163
Any deviation could
tip the scales to failure.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.866
Are you gonna sit
in the bed with us, too?

27:49.960 --> 27:52.543
Because that would definitely
make things more interesting.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.194
Joseph.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.711
Ah, I think it's time
to get started.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.191
Right.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.685
Of course.

28:34.296 --> 28:35.296
Beth?

28:44.473 --> 28:46.089
Don't move my stuff.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.445
Forgetful moments
sneaking up on you there, old man?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.787
And when Rachel saw that

29:11.333 --> 29:12.824
she bore Jacob no children,

29:14.878 --> 29:19.293
Rachel envied her sister,
and said unto Jacob,

29:21.260 --> 29:24.719
"Give me children,
or else I die."

29:34.690 --> 29:35.771
Aunt Lydia?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.437
There's no need to worry.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.519
Dr. Michaels will
be efficient.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.978
Lickety-split.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.615
Ofjoseph.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.783
We'll sit here quietly
for 20 minutes.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.961
And then, we'll go...
Go down.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.963
We can't just sit here.

30:47.054 --> 30:50.718
We can play Canasta.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.844
Got some cards up here.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.017
The doctor is
going to check me

30:56.938 --> 31:00.932
afterwards for the proof
that there was a Ceremony.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.062
- You swore...
- Eleanor, shh! Quiet!

31:06.198 --> 31:07.675
- ...we would never have to do this!
- You need to be quiet!

31:07.699 --> 31:09.427
- We don't have to do anything! Quiet!
- You swore it!

31:09.451 --> 31:11.033
Stop.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.614
You need to stop.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.412
We don't have
to do anything.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.082
Sir...

31:23.256 --> 31:24.667
Yes, we do.

31:30.305 --> 31:34.015
You helped to create
this world.

31:37.521 --> 31:40.059
How long did you think it would be
before it came for you?

31:40.148 --> 31:43.266
Every government makes room
for exceptions.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.939
This one ends with
both of you on the wall.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.942
Maybe we deserve it.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.701
I mean, at least
it would all be over.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.329
You'll be fine.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.711
It's... It's our sin.

32:08.301 --> 32:13.092
Handmaids are required
to report deviancy.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.551
Mmm-hmm.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.553
And Marthas.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.399
We would all be punished.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.982
No! No!

32:29.072 --> 32:30.279
My love! My love!

32:32.742 --> 32:34.233
My love.

32:34.744 --> 32:35.744
No!

32:35.829 --> 32:37.348
You need to be quiet.
You need to be quiet.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.052
You need to be quiet.
You need to be quiet.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.910
You need to be quiet.

32:45.172 --> 32:47.880
No!

32:50.927 --> 32:52.338
Look at me.

32:56.516 --> 32:57.632
It's okay.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.230
It's gonna be okay.

33:07.736 --> 33:08.817
Look at me.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.022
You can do this.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.524
Okay?

33:19.122 --> 33:20.454
Come on.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.177
Come over here.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.594
Sit right there.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.476
It doesn't mean anything.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.442
No matter what happens.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.196
It's okay, my love.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.365
You are
the love of my life.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.369
You are my love.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.891
You just treat it like a job.

34:34.030 --> 34:38.364
Try to detach yourself.
See it from the outside.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.915
You're not you.
I'm not me.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.830
This is a transaction.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.458
And then it's over.

35:01.308 --> 35:02.515
Are you sure?

35:07.272 --> 35:08.513
Mmm-hmm.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.064
It's easier if you
close your eyes.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.865
Where is Mrs. Lawrence?

37:14.023 --> 37:15.184
Eleanor?

37:20.363 --> 37:21.524
Serena.

37:26.953 --> 37:31.323
I'm so sorry. It's been so long
since we've had dinner.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.705
Let's see what we have.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.974
Any pain or discomfort?

38:32.644 --> 38:33.725
No, sir.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.519
Bleeding or cramping?

38:36.564 --> 38:37.600
No, sir. All good.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.603
Great.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.819
May He see fit to bring
about His blessed miracle.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.522
May I be truly worthy.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.995
A successful Ceremony.

39:01.965 --> 39:02.965
Praise be.

39:06.845 --> 39:07.845
Praise be.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.555
We should give the Lawrences
back their privacy.

39:16.729 --> 39:17.970
He does have
good Scotch.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.998
Are you... all right?

39:44.465 --> 39:45.831
Mmm-hmm.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.760
I mean,

39:50.930 --> 39:52.171
at least it wasn't you.

40:53.242 --> 40:54.358
How is Eleanor?

40:59.749 --> 41:01.536
She's very quiet.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.808
A collector's item.

41:29.737 --> 41:33.356
The punishment for contraception is
being torn apart by dogs.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.619
That's right.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.414
That's not gonna be
the last time that happens.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.589
You know that, right?

42:01.144 --> 42:02.555
I know.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.412
I'll get you a truck.

42:32.508 --> 42:35.000
You get my wife out safely.

42:47.482 --> 42:48.893
You can get out, too.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.233
You just have to
bring them something.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.238
Something valuable.

43:09.712 --> 43:10.793
Kids.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.587
The stolen children
of Gilead.

43:28.898 --> 43:30.309
I'd be a hero.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.432
- What do you want?
- I have a plan.

44:09.814 --> 44:11.555
You're like
a nightmare right now.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.023
Dylan's new name
is Joshua.

44:16.404 --> 44:17.736
He's five, right?

44:18.239 --> 44:20.526
He lives in Amherst,
with a Commander's family.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.326
And he's blond.

44:33.588 --> 44:34.920
His dad was blond.

44:45.933 --> 44:48.266
How long are we gonna let
Gilead keep him?

45:02.241 --> 45:03.241
What's your plan?

45:05.620 --> 45:07.782
I have a truck.
I think it fits 10. I've seen it.

45:08.998 --> 45:11.206
- And you?
- I'm not leaving without Hannah.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.914
We can't do something
like that ourselves.

45:15.004 --> 45:16.211
I know that.

45:16.756 --> 45:17.837
I can help.

45:21.344 --> 45:22.460
What? I'm brave.

45:28.851 --> 45:30.851
Sasha's little girl is still in
the Torrance house.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.852
Just a few blocks from me.

45:33.481 --> 45:35.097
She's old enough.
And quiet.

45:35.733 --> 45:36.733
I'll ask around.

45:55.920 --> 45:56.920
June?

45:57.672 --> 45:58.958
Mmm-hmm?

46:00.591 --> 46:02.583
Did you find out anything
about Caleb?

46:07.932 --> 46:10.640
Yeah. I did.

46:17.817 --> 46:20.434
His family was transferred
to California.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.114
His mom
seems super nice.

46:39.505 --> 46:40.746
He lives on the beach?

46:42.216 --> 46:43.297
Yeah.

46:44.593 --> 46:46.425
He lives on the beach.

47:19.003 --> 47:22.167
I know last night
was difficult.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.883
Thank you
for your resilience.

47:28.804 --> 47:31.137
Well, we have to be
a united front.

47:36.645 --> 47:37.645
Always.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.366
Fred, you've done
so much for Gilead.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.361
And I see that.

47:57.333 --> 47:58.869
But you're
getting distracted.

48:00.127 --> 48:03.370
It's been months, and
we're no closer to Nichole.

48:04.048 --> 48:05.505
I'm assuring a life for her.

48:05.591 --> 48:08.004
You're prioritizing yourself.

48:14.433 --> 48:16.015
And that's enough now.

48:18.562 --> 48:19.678
Serena...

48:21.690 --> 48:25.229
I thought that the Gilead channels were
the only way to get to Nichole,

48:25.319 --> 48:26.730
but they're not.

48:30.866 --> 48:33.324
I met someone in Canada
who can help us.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.324
An American.

48:58.310 --> 49:00.643
You just have to
offer your cooperation.

49:33.345 --> 49:34.506
I did what you asked.

49:36.807 --> 49:38.218
The Marthas?

49:40.060 --> 49:41.346
Muffins mean yes.

49:51.030 --> 49:52.111
I spread the word.

49:52.198 --> 49:54.110
I asked if anyone would
help get children out.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.275
I thought
they'd all say no.

50:09.131 --> 50:10.667
We're gonna need
a bigger boat.
