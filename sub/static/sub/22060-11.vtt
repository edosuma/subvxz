WEBVTT

00:11.360 --> 00:12.430
OFFICER:
Detectives.
Yup.

00:12.460 --> 00:14.200
I got a Jessica Guimond
here to see you.

00:14.230 --> 00:15.100
Who?

00:15.130 --> 00:17.430
I'm making a documentary
on Ethan Goodwin.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.740
Little busy here today.
Uh, send her over to DCPI.

00:22.770 --> 00:25.380
I have a source
that says he's innocent.

00:25.410 --> 00:28.310
Uh, is that source
named Ethan Goodwin?
No.

00:28.350 --> 00:30.580
Did that source tell you
that Ethan Goodwin confessed

00:30.610 --> 00:32.520
to the murder himself?

00:32.549 --> 00:34.250
Yes, and that
the confession was a lie.

00:34.280 --> 00:37.190
Ethan's son was killed in a
dispute over a basketball game.

00:37.220 --> 00:39.160
Ethan got revenge.
He confessed to the crime.

00:39.190 --> 00:41.390
It's an open-
and-shut case.

00:41.430 --> 00:42.830
I didn't come here to debate.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.660
Good. Then good-bye.

00:44.690 --> 00:46.830
I came 'cause my life
is being threatened.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.730
By who?
I don't know.

00:48.770 --> 00:51.270
Well, that makes two of us.

00:51.300 --> 00:54.370
Ever since I started
working on this project,

00:54.400 --> 00:56.640
I've been receiving
messages to back off.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.310
Do you have
any evidence of a crime?

00:59.340 --> 01:01.180
No, just the threats.

01:01.210 --> 01:02.850
Then I can't help you.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.849
I'm not... I'm not
asking any favors.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.550
Okay, I just wanted you to know.

01:06.580 --> 01:07.820
You wanted me to know what?

01:07.850 --> 01:11.520
That you've been threatened or
that you're making a documentary

01:11.560 --> 01:13.460
questioning the integrity
of my case?

01:13.490 --> 01:16.260
I wanted you to know because
if something happens to me,

01:16.290 --> 01:17.790
you'll connect it
to Ethan Goodwin's case.

01:17.830 --> 01:19.330
I'll be sure to do that.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.300
Or maybe I'll just make
a documentary about it.

01:21.330 --> 01:23.430
Good-bye.
OFFICER: Let's go.

01:29.470 --> 01:31.540
I was hoping that you would
lend your name and support

01:31.580 --> 01:35.610
to our initiative,
to speak out and tell the public

01:35.650 --> 01:38.550
why we need to rethink
the way we deal with addicts.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.820
Let me get this straight.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.720
You want to prescreen which
drug addicts you incarcerate

01:43.750 --> 01:45.590
and which you don't?

01:45.620 --> 01:49.560
Some low-level offenders
need rehab and not prison.

01:49.590 --> 01:51.660
Your father's
a compelling example,

01:51.700 --> 01:55.230
which is why I'm asking you
to share your family's story.

01:55.270 --> 01:56.900
Yes, my dad should've
gone to rehab.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.170
He was a doctor,
a father and husband,

01:59.200 --> 02:00.570
a contributing member
of society...

02:00.600 --> 02:03.510
He was also using and
prescribing opiates illegally.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.610
Until he got into heroin
in that cell you put him in.

02:05.640 --> 02:10.580
I'm here to try to change
the way we do business,

02:10.610 --> 02:12.950
so we can prevent
people like your father

02:12.980 --> 02:15.650
from just being dumped
into the system.

02:15.690 --> 02:18.220
Only I'm having a
hard time finding him.

02:18.260 --> 02:19.560
You and me both.

02:19.590 --> 02:22.660
Oh, I-I thought
he was practicing again,

02:22.690 --> 02:25.330
and he was clean and sober
for the past two years.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.500
You thought wrong.

02:26.530 --> 02:28.530
He started using again
six months ago.

02:28.570 --> 02:32.640
I'm sorry. I clearly have
outdated information.

02:32.670 --> 02:35.540
You really want to help?
Find my father.

02:36.610 --> 02:40.540
I am not
the Missing Persons bureau.

02:40.580 --> 02:42.510
I think you owe us that,
Ms. Reagan.

02:42.550 --> 02:44.380
Wherever my father is,

02:44.410 --> 02:47.580
it's at least partly
your responsibility.

02:54.260 --> 02:56.690
I fully support the D.A.'s
initiative to separate out

02:56.730 --> 02:59.560
those offenders
whose profiles meet a standard

02:59.600 --> 03:03.900
for rehabilitation
instead of incarceration.

03:03.930 --> 03:09.270
But, in my opinion,
it does not go far enough.

03:09.310 --> 03:13.910
Today, I am challenging our
lawmakers and our justice system

03:13.940 --> 03:17.910
to decriminalize possession
and use of all narcotics,

03:17.950 --> 03:19.720
across the board,

03:19.750 --> 03:23.620
to dismantle the nanny state
once and for all

03:23.650 --> 03:26.760
and give the right to choose
back to the people,

03:26.790 --> 03:30.690
which is just,
which is the American way.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.900
Son of a bitch.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.510
I just saw it, but I
can't believe my eyes.

03:42.540 --> 03:43.710
Or ears. This is out there?

03:43.740 --> 03:45.340
How'd they do it?

03:45.380 --> 03:46.340
There's technology out there

03:46.380 --> 03:48.610
that allows for audio
and video manipulation.

03:48.650 --> 03:50.380
All they need's
20 minutes of recordings,

03:50.410 --> 03:52.850
and they can manipulate
any footage they have on you.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.020
Sounds like science fiction.

03:54.050 --> 03:55.590
Who has these capabilities?

03:55.620 --> 03:59.260
Probably all the players...
including us, obviously.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.830
Boss?

04:02.860 --> 04:04.860
Sir?

04:04.890 --> 04:07.600
We have a suspect in custody?

04:07.630 --> 04:09.630
Computer Crime Squad's
all over it.

04:09.670 --> 04:10.670
This just broke
less than an hour ago.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.770
When we do,

04:11.800 --> 04:14.600
hopefully before the next one,
I want to be there.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.710
Be where?

04:15.740 --> 04:19.079
To make the arrest.
I want to look him in the eye.

04:19.110 --> 04:21.310
I worked my whole life
to earn the trust

04:21.350 --> 04:23.650
of the people I serve.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.910
I can see you're shook up,
but...

04:24.950 --> 04:27.580
I know you're gonna
make a statement.

04:27.620 --> 04:30.720
I know it is gonna be called out
as fake; I got that.

04:30.750 --> 04:34.690
But this? This is personal.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.800
She came to you for help, Danny.

04:43.830 --> 04:44.800
What if she really needs it?

04:44.830 --> 04:46.900
I already told you,
I didn't screw up that case.

04:46.940 --> 04:48.740
You can't ignore
what she has to say

04:48.770 --> 04:49.770
just because she set you off.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.780
I'm not set off.
I know you.

04:51.810 --> 04:53.480
The minute she said
she was looking

04:53.510 --> 04:55.710
into an old case of yours,
she became the enemy.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.380
I'm here, aren't I?

04:58.420 --> 05:00.750
Jessica Guimond! Police!

05:02.000 --> 05:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:13.760 --> 05:16.870
*

05:40.690 --> 05:42.490
You said she'd been
receiving threats.

05:42.530 --> 05:44.090
She say by who?

05:44.130 --> 05:45.600
No.

05:45.630 --> 05:48.430
As in, she didn't know
or you didn't ask?

05:48.470 --> 05:49.630
Uh, I didn't have
a chance to ask.

05:49.670 --> 05:51.870
And would you please stop
guilting me about it? Thank you.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.100
You think she was right?
That Goodwin was innocent?

05:54.140 --> 05:56.010
Well, that wouldn't explain
a kidnapping, would it?

05:56.040 --> 05:58.540
Unless she got too close
to the real murderer.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.140
Or maybe somebody
just didn't want her

06:00.180 --> 06:01.910
sticking her nose in
where it didn't belong.

06:01.950 --> 06:03.610
How about that?

06:03.650 --> 06:05.620
You find something?

06:05.650 --> 06:06.580
It's her schedule book.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.920
She's pretty OCD.
She writes everything down.

06:08.950 --> 06:10.920
Here's her meeting with me.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.590
Now, she did have
a lunch scheduled

06:12.620 --> 06:15.530
with a Jason Bevan afterwards.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.560
Maybe he's the last to seen her.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.460
I need a favor.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.670
Only reason you ever
come down to my closet.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.900
I need you to find someone,
a Dr. Lee McByrne.

06:25.940 --> 06:28.510
Doesn't ring a bell.

06:28.540 --> 06:31.710
I prosecuted him for illegally
prescribing himself meds.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.210
Seems he might be using again.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.940
Yeah, him and half
of New York City.

06:34.980 --> 06:38.580
That'll be like finding
a needle in a syringe stack.

06:38.620 --> 06:39.920
What's he to you?

06:39.950 --> 06:42.920
His son blames me
for what happened.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.620
You didn't put
the needle in his arm.

06:44.650 --> 06:46.690
No, but I recommended
the judge send him to prison,

06:46.720 --> 06:47.820
where he got into heroin.

06:47.860 --> 06:49.630
He chose that path, not you.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.960
Maybe I helped him along.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.800
Can you find him?

06:57.170 --> 06:58.870
I'll work my magic.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.200
But no blaming me
for what I find, okay?

07:01.240 --> 07:02.610
I promise.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.610
GORMLEY: His name
is Colin Taylor.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.580
31, ex-Navy, worked
Intelligence there.

07:07.610 --> 07:09.710
He pops as a partner
in a company

07:09.750 --> 07:11.720
that's been developing
technologies

07:11.750 --> 07:13.220
in digital manipulation.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.550
Anything go to motive?

07:14.580 --> 07:15.690
Nothing so far.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.020
No flags on his discharge
or on the firm he's with.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.260
Do we know where he is?

07:19.290 --> 07:20.720
We're working on that.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.260
Is this one of those
Internet things

07:22.290 --> 07:24.730
where the guy's working above
a bakery in Eastern Europe?

07:24.760 --> 07:26.200
A car registered to him
made a round trip

07:26.230 --> 07:28.130
through the Midtown Tunnel
two days ago, so I doubt it.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.930
Okay, can anyone give me a why?

07:30.970 --> 07:34.100
Maybe it's a publicity stunt to
prove their tech actually works.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.510
And I'm the guinea pig?

07:35.540 --> 07:36.510
Not saying that.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.640
Or he's one of them disruptors.

07:37.670 --> 07:40.080
But what's he disrupting,
putting words in my mouth?

07:40.110 --> 07:42.280
Boss, have you even heard
of this guy before just now?

07:42.310 --> 07:43.950
No, I have not.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.680
Then let's assume it isn't
personal. Turn that flame down.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.620
I can't. Maybe some could.
I can't.

07:48.650 --> 07:49.890
May I try?

07:49.920 --> 07:51.590
Was it your face, your voice?

07:51.620 --> 07:52.720
No.
Then no.

07:53.790 --> 07:54.590
Boss, can I say one thing?

07:54.620 --> 07:56.960
The idea of you
being at the arrest,

07:56.990 --> 07:59.200
I think it sends
the wrong signal.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.730
We got murderers,

08:00.760 --> 08:03.600
rapists, arsonists,
all kinds of bad guys.

08:03.630 --> 08:07.700
And I don't show up
at any of those collars.

08:07.740 --> 08:09.270
Exactly.

08:09.310 --> 08:12.040
Okay.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.710
I'm sorry I'm right.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.210
You need to come out
loud and clear

08:15.240 --> 08:16.910
about the D.A.'s Diversion
and Treatment Program.

08:16.950 --> 08:18.750
Okay, I'm against it.

08:18.780 --> 08:20.250
Press conference
or select interviews?

08:20.280 --> 08:22.550
Neither. I just said it.
I'm against it.

08:22.590 --> 08:25.190
Copy that.

08:25.220 --> 08:27.960
And, boss, I'm gonna bring you
the head of Colin Taylor.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.530
You can count on me.

08:39.169 --> 08:42.270
I saw Jessica yesterday
at our weekly status meeting.

08:42.309 --> 08:45.070
She seem nervous or express
any concern for her safety?

08:45.110 --> 08:46.780
No, she was totally normal.

08:46.810 --> 08:49.280
She say if she was
going somewhere after?

08:49.310 --> 08:52.120
I think to talk to one of
her mysterious sources.

08:54.820 --> 08:56.620
Is everything all right?

08:56.650 --> 08:57.620
Did Jessica do something?

08:57.650 --> 09:00.090
Did she mention
she'd been receiving threats?

09:00.120 --> 09:01.830
Threats

09:01.860 --> 09:03.160
DANNY:
We don't know.

09:03.190 --> 09:05.190
Possibly somebody
who wants to screw a lid

09:05.230 --> 09:07.200
on her project
about Ethan Goodwin.

09:07.230 --> 09:09.270
We all want her
to put an end to it,

09:09.300 --> 09:11.770
but no, I don't know anyone
who would threaten her.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.000
You've told her
to stop the project?

09:13.040 --> 09:15.300
Yeah, it's a dead story.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.140
Dead how?

09:17.170 --> 09:18.840
Ethan Goodwin still
maintains he's guilty.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.810
The whole Goodwin family
wants nothing to do with this.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.310
So her source isn't somebody
inside the Goodwin family?

09:23.350 --> 09:25.280
Nope. And if they don't
want a part in it,

09:25.310 --> 09:26.350
it's got to be bogus.

09:29.290 --> 09:31.290
Maybe so. We'll be in touch.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.740
Uh...

09:51.780 --> 09:53.840
You're interrupting
visiting hours

09:53.880 --> 09:55.240
with my daughter, Detectives.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.410
We were hoping we could've
met with you in private.

09:57.450 --> 09:59.150
We hardly get to see
each other as it is.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.320
Fair enough.
We'll make it quick.

10:02.690 --> 10:05.220
Did you get a visit
from Jessica Guimond?

10:05.250 --> 10:06.790
Yeah, a few times, yeah.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.730
She tell you she was convinced
that you were innocent?

10:08.760 --> 10:11.360
I told her she got it wrong.

10:11.390 --> 10:13.030
Why would she think otherwise?

10:13.060 --> 10:15.770
Seemed like she was just...

10:15.800 --> 10:17.270
fishing for one of them stories.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.370
One of...

10:18.400 --> 10:20.840
"them stories"?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.740
Yeah.

10:22.770 --> 10:25.940
Black man gets railroaded.
Put a tear in your eye.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.680
Well, I told her that I'm
not one of those stories.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.810
I did what I'm in for.
BAEZ: What do you care

10:30.850 --> 10:32.280
what kind of story
she was telling

10:32.320 --> 10:33.750
if the whole point of it was

10:33.780 --> 10:35.250
to get you out of here?

10:35.280 --> 10:38.860
A man in prison can still
care about the truth.

10:38.890 --> 10:42.090
I just want to serve
my time and get out.

10:42.130 --> 10:43.330
We're trying to get my father

10:43.360 --> 10:45.060
moved to a prison
closer to home.

10:45.090 --> 10:47.060
That's all we're about
right now.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.330
So, why are you here?

10:48.360 --> 10:50.100
Jessica Guimond is missing.

10:50.130 --> 10:51.970
She's missing?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.070
DANNY:
Mm-hmm.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.470
We think kidnapped, maybe.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.810
And you think I had
something to do with it?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.910
Look around.

10:59.940 --> 11:01.380
I don't got no way
to do nothing.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.910
LAUREN:
Daddy.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.780
Are you sure
you don't know anything?

11:04.810 --> 11:06.120
No!
I got to ask.

11:06.150 --> 11:08.080
No.
She was just trying to help you.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.920
I don't know nothing about it.

11:09.950 --> 11:11.760
DANNY:
Okay.

11:11.790 --> 11:13.790
Anyone threaten you?

11:13.820 --> 11:16.060
Threaten me?
What are you talking about? No.

11:16.090 --> 11:17.830
It's conceivable you
were threatened, too.

11:17.860 --> 11:18.960
You know anything about that?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.300
The one thing I know,
Mr. Reagan,

11:21.330 --> 11:24.200
is that you put me in here,

11:24.230 --> 11:27.840
and there's nothing more
you can do to me or make me do.

11:30.210 --> 11:32.280
Now get out and leave us be.

11:32.310 --> 11:35.080
Okay.

11:35.110 --> 11:37.110
Enjoy your visit.

11:55.060 --> 11:56.900
Dr. McByrne?

11:56.930 --> 11:59.040
Used to be.

12:00.140 --> 12:03.540
Erin Reagan.

12:03.570 --> 12:05.310
What are you doing here?

12:05.340 --> 12:07.840
Your son asked me to find you.
He's worried about you.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.050
You bought that?

12:10.080 --> 12:11.450
He wants you to get help.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.980
And I want to be left alone.

12:14.020 --> 12:16.490
So give me that one victory,
would you?

12:16.520 --> 12:18.490
This don't smell like victory.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.490
To each his own, big man.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.190
How'd you stay clean
for a year and a half?

12:25.230 --> 12:28.230
With great difficulty.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.930
Well, if you did it once...

12:29.970 --> 12:32.240
I've been in rehab four times.

12:32.270 --> 12:33.940
Nothing sticks.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.970
Apparently Jesus helps, but...

12:37.010 --> 12:39.110
I never believed in ghosts.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.240
Oh, you have this down pat, huh?

12:41.280 --> 12:44.810
Had a lot of time
to take personal stock.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.380
Prison'll do that to you.

12:49.850 --> 12:51.150
You care about your son?

12:51.190 --> 12:54.490
I care that he moves on.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.430
That I'm not a burden to him,

12:56.460 --> 12:58.590
that he takes responsibility
for his life

12:58.630 --> 13:00.900
the same way that
I've taken for mine.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.070
You call this responsibility?

13:02.100 --> 13:03.170
Yes, I do, and you, Miss Reagan,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.400
you don't get to lecture me
about responsibility,

13:05.430 --> 13:08.940
not until you're ready to cop
to your place in all this.

13:08.970 --> 13:10.010
She didn't do this to you.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.240
It's okay, Anthony.
No, she didn't.

13:11.270 --> 13:13.010
I did, but she made sure

13:13.040 --> 13:15.850
that I got a head start
down this road.

13:18.410 --> 13:21.850
Well, if I did, I'm sorry.

13:26.420 --> 13:29.030
Apology accepted.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.360
Now, please,

13:31.390 --> 13:33.200
just let me be.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.230
Please.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.150
We found your father.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.580
Was he scrubbing up for surgery?

13:55.620 --> 13:56.890
No.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.120
Kidding.

13:58.150 --> 13:58.850
Yeah, funny.

13:58.890 --> 13:59.960
You got a parent
who's an addict,

13:59.990 --> 14:00.920
you make jokes to stay sane.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.890
We tried to get him help.
He wouldn't listen.

14:02.930 --> 14:04.260
Saw that coming.

14:04.290 --> 14:06.100
Because it was coming from me.

14:06.130 --> 14:08.400
He blames me
for the shape he's in.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.900
What did you expect?

14:09.930 --> 14:11.940
That a doctor would be
smarter than that.

14:11.970 --> 14:14.400
Hold on. You have no right.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.310
No. A guy comes in here
all busted up

14:16.340 --> 14:18.610
because he was hit by a truck,
do you operate

14:18.640 --> 14:21.640
or do you tell him,
"It's the truck driver's fault,

14:21.680 --> 14:23.610
so go find him
and have him operate."

14:23.650 --> 14:25.350
Close, but no cigar.

14:25.380 --> 14:26.520
Pretty damn close.

14:26.550 --> 14:28.420
Why ask her to find him
in the first place

14:28.450 --> 14:30.290
when you're standing
on the sidelines?

14:30.320 --> 14:33.520
Because I wanted her to see
what she did to him.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.530
Well, I did, and it sucks,
and we can sit here

14:36.560 --> 14:39.130
and debate whether or not
I'm the truck driver here,

14:39.160 --> 14:41.530
but in the meantime, the
patient is still busted up.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.400
So what are you gonna do, Doc?

14:43.430 --> 14:44.970
What do you want me to do?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.200
Your job.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.970
A man is in pain and there's
only one doctor in the house.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.080
You think Ethan is lying?

14:53.110 --> 14:54.280
No.

14:54.310 --> 14:58.180
I think maybe I might've
been a little quick

14:58.210 --> 15:00.180
to take his confession
back then.

15:00.220 --> 15:01.480
He admitted
to committing a homicide.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.390
No one would blame you
for not looking further.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.420
Right, and if I did
happen to miss something...

15:05.450 --> 15:07.160
which is a big if...

15:07.190 --> 15:09.230
it's the kind of thing you
wouldn't even know to look for.

15:09.260 --> 15:10.490
Look at this.

15:10.530 --> 15:12.700
The night Jessica disappeared.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.560
This is the last time we see her

15:14.600 --> 15:16.270
entering or exiting
the building.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.500
And he leaves later without her.

15:18.530 --> 15:20.340
DANNY:
Okay.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.410
We got any video of her
coming back out again?

15:22.440 --> 15:24.410
The camera in the back is
busted; this is all we've got.

15:25.610 --> 15:28.040
Hold on, look at that.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.510
The-the earrings.

15:31.550 --> 15:33.380
I've seen that before.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.680
It's, um...

15:35.720 --> 15:38.590
it's a mark, the Hellians,
a gang, the Hellians.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.220
That's the Hellians marker.
Hellians?

15:40.260 --> 15:42.660
They were a gang that was active
in the neighborhood

15:42.690 --> 15:44.560
back in the day
around the time of the murder.

15:44.590 --> 15:47.160
Can't be a coincidence.
Do you think this guy did it?

15:47.200 --> 15:48.730
I think I want to speak to him.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.300
Let's call Gang Unit and see if
they can put a name to the face.

16:02.450 --> 16:03.510
He's here.

16:03.550 --> 16:04.780
Hey, Dad.

16:04.810 --> 16:06.350
A.D.A. Reagan.

16:06.380 --> 16:07.620
Oh, it's one of those.

16:07.650 --> 16:08.650
Afraid so.

16:12.390 --> 16:14.690
Good afternoon, Commissioner.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.490
Thanks for coming in.

16:17.530 --> 16:19.360
Did you see it?

16:19.400 --> 16:22.430
I did. I'm sorry.

16:22.470 --> 16:23.400
Your office behind it?

16:23.430 --> 16:25.630
Is that a real question?

16:25.670 --> 16:28.500
No.

16:28.540 --> 16:31.470
It's just the whole idea
of "real" seems up for grabs.

16:31.510 --> 16:33.440
Well, it's one thing
when you read about it.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.810
It's a whole 'nother
when you're the...
Puppet?

16:35.840 --> 16:37.180
You okay?

16:39.420 --> 16:41.480
Actually, I'm being
a big baby about it.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.750
I know it, but I can't
seem to shake it.

16:44.790 --> 16:47.520
It's completely understandable.

16:47.560 --> 16:51.430
Well, I'm supposed to be
tougher than the rest.

16:51.460 --> 16:54.830
Look, I never liked
the camera when I was a cop.

16:54.860 --> 16:56.530
I used to make myself scarce

16:56.570 --> 16:59.570
when the news trucks
came around, but this job,

16:59.600 --> 17:02.310
I got to, so I bite a bullet.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.770
But that's all an act.

17:04.810 --> 17:07.240
I don't know.

17:07.280 --> 17:11.150
I guess when you work so hard
to overcome something

17:11.180 --> 17:12.619
and it gets
turned against you...

17:12.650 --> 17:14.180
You feel violated.

17:14.220 --> 17:17.119
No, that's a word
real victims own.

17:17.150 --> 17:18.790
I'm just feeling...

17:20.790 --> 17:23.630
Vulnerable?

17:23.660 --> 17:26.560
Your secret's safe with me.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.700
Thank you.

17:31.770 --> 17:34.470
Okay.

17:34.500 --> 17:37.510
I wanted to give you
fair warning.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.580
You're coming out
against my office.

17:40.610 --> 17:43.610
Well, I have to clear it up,

17:43.650 --> 17:46.550
state my real opinion now
that the fake one's gone viral.

17:46.580 --> 17:48.350
Which is the same as saying

17:48.380 --> 17:50.690
you're going to
torpedo the program.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.690
No, I'm not gonna
shoot you down.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.390
But that's what
it will amount to.

17:55.420 --> 17:57.490
The initiative's
a good thing, Dad.

17:57.530 --> 18:01.500
It leans in on
normalizing drug use.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.270
It's not normalizing anything.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.570
It's getting people the help
they need when they need it.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.640
It could change the stigma
of drugs in general.

18:09.670 --> 18:11.640
Well, that stigma
is a useful tool.

18:11.670 --> 18:13.510
I don't want to lose it.
I'm sorry.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.910
If you could've seen
what I just saw,

18:15.940 --> 18:18.650
a doctor that we put away for...
Erin.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.880
That's not gonna change my mind.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.860
You know what?

18:28.890 --> 18:32.260
The fake you in that tape
made some good points

18:32.300 --> 18:34.300
the real you should
pay attention to.

18:50.210 --> 18:52.180
Looking for a Mason Grant.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.950
Heard he hangs out here.
You seen him around?

18:53.980 --> 18:55.680
Never heard of him.
Never seen him.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.520
"Never heard of him.
Never seen him."

18:57.550 --> 18:59.520
Sure you haven't.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.560
Anybody here know a Mason Grant?

19:02.590 --> 19:04.560
Don't know who that is.

19:04.590 --> 19:05.830
We're not looking
for any problems here.

19:05.860 --> 19:07.830
We just need to ask him
a few questions.

19:07.860 --> 19:09.370
Sorry, man.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.870
Hey! Police!

19:10.900 --> 19:12.240
Get out of the way!

19:12.270 --> 19:13.700
Turn around!
Hands on the table!

19:30.290 --> 19:31.590
Jack, hey.

19:31.620 --> 19:33.460
Listen, I'm gonna be home
late again, all right?

19:33.490 --> 19:34.760
You're gonna miss the game?

19:34.790 --> 19:35.860
I'm not gonna miss the game,

19:35.890 --> 19:36.990
but I'm probably gonna
miss dinner,

19:37.030 --> 19:38.460
so why don't you pick up
a pizza, okay?

19:38.490 --> 19:40.600
Sounds like
a silver lining to me.

19:40.630 --> 19:41.700
Ha-ha, very funny.

19:41.730 --> 19:43.770
You guys do your homework?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.670
Yeah. We're done.
DANNY: All right.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.740
And make sure Sean
starts his project, okay?

19:47.770 --> 19:50.770
I'll see you in a while.

19:50.810 --> 19:53.840
BAEZ: You sure you don't
recognize this woman?

19:53.880 --> 19:54.980
Never seen her.

19:55.010 --> 19:56.280
Not even with Mason?

19:56.310 --> 19:57.780
I barely even see him.

19:57.810 --> 19:59.480
How do you two know each other?

19:59.520 --> 20:01.580
We were both members of
the Hellians back in the day.

20:01.620 --> 20:02.450
And you still are?

20:02.490 --> 20:05.950
Nah. Gang got broken up
a long time ago.

20:05.990 --> 20:08.660
Oh, right. So you just
stay in touch with each other

20:08.690 --> 20:10.630
and hang out from time to time,
is that it?

20:10.660 --> 20:12.930
Yeah, from time to time.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.900
Sounds like consorting.

20:14.930 --> 20:17.700
Yeah, sure sounds like
consorting to me, too.

20:17.730 --> 20:19.370
Come on.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.770
You got nothing on me.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.670
Hmm.
Actually, we've got you

20:21.700 --> 20:24.610
on obstructing
governmental administration.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.640
Quite literally obstructing it.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.910
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me, either.

20:28.940 --> 20:30.050
You're the one
that bumped into me.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.410
DAMIAN: I had a few drinks.
Mm-hmm.

20:31.450 --> 20:32.620
Didn't mean to
bump into the detective.

20:32.650 --> 20:33.550
Yeah, I'm sure you didn't.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.520
And it's fortunate for
you that I care more

20:35.550 --> 20:36.620
about getting home to my kids

20:36.650 --> 20:40.660
than seeing your lying ass
end up in jail tonight.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.390
Now, just tell us
where Mason is,

20:42.430 --> 20:45.790
we'll issue a D.A.T. and
you'll be on your way.

20:45.830 --> 20:46.960
What's that mean?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.960
It means tell us
where we can find Mason

20:49.000 --> 20:50.830
and you can get
the hell out of here!

20:50.870 --> 20:53.500
Otherwise, it's into the system.

20:53.540 --> 20:55.640
I don't know where he lives
or anything like that.

20:55.670 --> 20:57.370
Well, you said you still
stay in touch, right?

20:57.410 --> 20:58.540
So you must have
his phone number.

20:58.570 --> 21:00.010
We'll take that.

21:00.040 --> 21:03.480
Give us his phone number so
we can get the hell out of here

21:03.510 --> 21:04.810
and go home, tonight!

21:04.850 --> 21:05.810
I can't snitch like that.

21:05.850 --> 21:07.650
Okay, well, don't think
of it as snitching.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.920
All right? Think of it
as avoiding another charge,

21:09.950 --> 21:11.690
because we already
got you on obstructing,

21:11.720 --> 21:13.920
and we're about to get you
on hindering prosecution!

21:13.960 --> 21:15.990
Now give us
the damn phone number!

21:19.430 --> 21:21.330
Come on, Sean,
you got to start your project

21:21.360 --> 21:22.770
or you're never gonna finish.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.700
I'll do it first thing
in the morning tomorrow.

21:25.730 --> 21:27.800
All right, you're getting up
earlier than me then.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.740
But that's like 5:00 a.m.
Yeah, you want to

21:29.770 --> 21:31.670
watch the game, you get
up earlier than me.

21:31.710 --> 21:33.640
That's the deal.
Where the hell's your brother?

21:33.680 --> 21:34.710
He should've been back by now.

21:34.740 --> 21:37.680
I don't know, but I'm hungry.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.780
Jack, that you?

21:44.750 --> 21:46.590
What the hell happened, Jack?

21:46.620 --> 21:48.490
Hey, what happened to you?

21:48.520 --> 21:50.690
I tried stopping them.
They drove away.

21:50.730 --> 21:52.930
Get the first aid kit.
No, it's in the bathroom.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.660
Who Who did this?

21:54.700 --> 21:55.730
Dad, I'm fine.

21:55.760 --> 21:56.700
You're not fine!

21:56.730 --> 21:57.730
You're all beat up,
your glasses are broken.

21:57.770 --> 21:59.870
What the hell happened?
They were leaving this.

22:16.450 --> 22:17.620
DANNY:
Jack saw them walking away

22:17.650 --> 22:18.690
from our door.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.620
He went after them,
but they sucker punched him

22:20.660 --> 22:22.660
before he could do anything.
Is he all right?

22:22.690 --> 22:24.660
Yeah, he's fine.
He's tougher than he lets on.

22:24.690 --> 22:25.660
I'm sorry, Danny.

22:25.690 --> 22:26.930
Don't be sorry for me.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.830
Be sorry for the son of a bitch
who did this

22:28.860 --> 22:29.700
when I get my hands on him.

22:29.730 --> 22:30.930
Did he see their face?

22:30.970 --> 22:32.940
No, he said they had on
a cap and a hoodie.

22:32.970 --> 22:34.570
It was too dark
to see anything else.

22:35.700 --> 22:37.540
You know, whoever did this,

22:37.570 --> 22:38.810
they knew who we were.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.010
I mean,

22:40.040 --> 22:41.640
they had to have been
tipped off.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.950
Maybe someone recognized you
from the initial case.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.580
Maybe.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.680
What else do we got
on this Mason Grant?

22:48.720 --> 22:49.920
TARU called
just before you got here.

22:49.950 --> 22:51.550
They got the location
on his phone.

22:51.590 --> 22:53.560
Well, what the hell
are we waiting for? Let's go.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.600
Get out of here.
Come on, beat it.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.770
Hey, you in a hurry?

23:08.800 --> 23:09.770
Yeah, I am actually,

23:09.810 --> 23:11.640
if you don't mind.
We do.

23:11.670 --> 23:13.140
You're gonna tell us
everything you know

23:13.180 --> 23:14.810
about Jessica Guimond.
Jessica?

23:14.840 --> 23:16.210
Yeah.
What are you
talking about?

23:16.240 --> 23:17.610
She was last seen with you.

23:17.650 --> 23:18.780
What do you mean "last seen"?

23:18.810 --> 23:20.020
Don't play stupid.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.450
She's been missing 48 hours.

23:22.490 --> 23:25.850
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

23:26.790 --> 23:28.090
Good.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.790
Let's take a walk.

23:29.830 --> 23:30.930
Come on.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.930
ABETEMARCO:
As far as my guys

23:36.970 --> 23:38.900
on the street know,
he's in the wind.

23:38.930 --> 23:40.170
How many guys we talking about?

23:40.200 --> 23:42.040
Enough.
Anthony.

23:42.070 --> 23:44.770
You're wasting resources,
including me.

23:44.810 --> 23:46.540
How can you say
I'm wasting resources?

23:46.580 --> 23:48.910
Because you're looking for a guy
who doesn't want to be found,

23:48.940 --> 23:51.180
for his son who doesn't care
about finding him.

23:51.210 --> 23:53.080
Pretty much defines
wasting resources.

23:55.020 --> 23:57.750
There's a Brian McByrne
here to see you.

23:57.790 --> 23:59.020
Oh.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.890
Okay, send him in.

24:03.930 --> 24:06.900
A.D.A. Reagan,
Detective ABETEMARCO.

24:06.930 --> 24:09.030
We got nothing for you, Brian.
Sorry.

24:09.060 --> 24:11.030
Uh, I didn't come
here for results.

24:11.070 --> 24:12.270
What then?

24:12.300 --> 24:15.040
My father always said to me,

24:15.070 --> 24:16.870
"There's nothing
you're gonna go through

24:16.910 --> 24:18.910
that I haven't been through
already, so come to me."

24:18.940 --> 24:21.010
But now he's not there anymore?

24:21.040 --> 24:23.110
It's that...

24:23.150 --> 24:27.150
what he's going through, no one
in our family has been through.

24:27.180 --> 24:29.150
Maybe that's how
I can pay him back.

24:29.180 --> 24:31.150
How?

24:31.190 --> 24:33.690
By giving him one more try.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.090
A real try.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.260
Do you know where
we could find him?

24:39.290 --> 24:40.960
I think so.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.200
When he first got out of prison,

24:42.230 --> 24:44.070
he was in a halfway house
in Queens.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.570
He liked the neighborhood,
made some friends,

24:46.600 --> 24:47.970
got some traction.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.210
I'm kind of hoping maybe
he made his way back there.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.910
Can you hope without
getting your hopes up?

24:52.940 --> 24:54.680
Will you help me find him?

24:54.710 --> 24:56.010
Please?

25:04.690 --> 25:06.890
BAKER: Sir?

25:12.630 --> 25:14.900
I'm sorry to interrupt.

25:18.900 --> 25:22.200
Well, I was thinking.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.710
I can only imagine.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.180
Can you, now?

25:27.210 --> 25:30.580
If I found myself,
watching myself,

25:30.610 --> 25:32.950
saying things I'd never say,
but for all the world

25:32.980 --> 25:35.920
it looked like it was me
saying them? Hell yeah.

25:35.950 --> 25:38.720
Thank you.

25:38.750 --> 25:41.790
Lieutenant GORMLEY asked
to see you in his office.

25:48.260 --> 25:50.600
Commissioner Reagan.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.700
Colin Taylor.

26:02.750 --> 26:05.980
But you already know who I am.

26:06.010 --> 26:07.650
Yes.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.020
Obviously.
Yes.

26:09.050 --> 26:11.250
Do you know why
you were brought here?

26:11.290 --> 26:12.890
Not so much.

26:12.920 --> 26:15.820
Because I wanted
to look you in the eye.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.730
You got a beef with cops?

26:19.760 --> 26:20.730
No.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.060
Just me, then?

26:22.100 --> 26:24.130
Not you, directly,

26:24.170 --> 26:26.840
but this idea that
drug addicts should have

26:26.870 --> 26:28.800
some kind of safe space
touchy-feely treatment...

26:28.840 --> 26:31.170
That's propaganda.
That's not what that program is.

26:31.210 --> 26:33.880
That's the way
the wars are being fought.

26:36.410 --> 26:39.010
Who'd you lose?

26:39.050 --> 26:40.650
What do you mean, who'd I lose?

26:40.680 --> 26:43.150
Who'd you lose? Some drug addict
did what to who?

26:45.290 --> 26:48.260
My little brother got
his throat slit for his wallet.

26:50.760 --> 26:54.000
So you made the leap...
and framed me.

26:54.030 --> 26:57.070
That's how the wars
are being fought.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.100
Upping the stakes,
whatever it takes,

26:59.130 --> 27:00.440
however you can.

27:00.470 --> 27:03.210
Ex-Naval Intelligence.
You learn this there?

27:03.240 --> 27:05.840
Some of the techniques, yeah.

27:05.870 --> 27:07.180
Could make a case for treason.

27:12.010 --> 27:14.980
I got a lot of friends
at the D.A.'s office.

27:15.020 --> 27:17.090
I never ask them for favors.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.960
I'm gonna make an exception
in your case.

27:19.990 --> 27:23.760
I got good lawyers.
They'll sell this as a prank.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.130
I'm gonna come at you
with everything I have.

27:30.170 --> 27:33.140
That's how this war
is being fought.

27:42.210 --> 27:43.880
DANNY:
Sound to us

27:43.910 --> 27:45.880
like you've been consorting
with fellow gang members.

27:45.910 --> 27:47.450
Former gang members.
Right.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.990
I'm out of that life.
I put it behind me.

27:50.020 --> 27:51.490
Right, and that's why you run

27:51.520 --> 27:52.960
every time you see cops, huh?

27:52.990 --> 27:54.160
I don't trust cops.

27:54.190 --> 27:55.790
Never have.
That's good.

27:55.820 --> 27:59.030
'Cause I don't trust scumbags.
Never will.

27:59.060 --> 28:00.860
Now, what the hell were you
doing with Jessica Guimond

28:00.900 --> 28:01.860
the day she went missing?

28:01.900 --> 28:04.270
We went out to dinner to talk.

28:04.300 --> 28:06.130
I walked her home after.

28:06.170 --> 28:08.470
That's very interesting,

28:08.500 --> 28:10.940
because I took a pretty good
look at her calendar book,

28:10.970 --> 28:12.340
which she keeps
very detailed records in,

28:12.370 --> 28:14.310
and I didn't see your name
anywhere in there.

28:14.340 --> 28:15.310
Did you see it?

28:15.340 --> 28:16.980
Didn't see your name.

28:17.010 --> 28:18.180
She was keeping
our meetings secret.

28:18.210 --> 28:19.350
Sounds convenient.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.250
We were at Donnie's Diner.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.290
They got cameras; you can check.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.890
Hold on,
so you're trying to tell us

28:26.920 --> 28:30.060
that you were the source
for her documentary?

28:30.090 --> 28:31.030
Yes.

28:31.060 --> 28:33.060
And she's protecting you?
Yes.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.530
'Cause I told her the truth
about Ethan Goodwin.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.970
And what's that?
That he's innocent.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.200
Oh, boy. Here we go again
with the conspiracy theories.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.370
You know what?

28:41.400 --> 28:42.840
15 years!

28:42.870 --> 28:45.140
15 years,
and Ethan Goodwin's never said

28:45.170 --> 28:47.210
anyone committed
that murder except him!

28:47.240 --> 28:49.510
Now you're gonna sit up here and
tell us it was someone else?!

28:49.540 --> 28:53.220
Man, I'm telling you, I went to
the same high school as Robbie.

28:53.250 --> 28:56.050
So what?
I was around
when the whole thing went down.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.150
So the Hellians did have
something to do

28:57.190 --> 28:58.150
with their murders.

28:58.190 --> 29:00.890
No! It was a neighborhood beef,

29:00.920 --> 29:03.130
but Ethan Goodwin
didn't kill anybody.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.990
Then who did?
His daughter.

29:05.030 --> 29:06.290
Lauren.

29:06.330 --> 29:09.160
Day after Robbie
killed her brother.

29:19.940 --> 29:21.110
ABETEMARCO:
You got any other ideas?

29:21.140 --> 29:23.010
We hit every bar
and all the parks.

29:23.050 --> 29:24.310
No. I was hoping he...

29:24.350 --> 29:26.180
Yeah, but like I said?

29:26.210 --> 29:28.380
I don't have my hopes up.
Thank you for...

29:28.420 --> 29:30.290
Nothing, as it turns out.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.290
BRIAN: Not nothing.
Thank you.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.160
DISPATCHER: Robbery in progress
on 37th Avenue

29:34.190 --> 29:35.590
and 76th Street. Respond.

29:35.620 --> 29:37.830
Some of this is my fault.
I could've done more.

29:37.860 --> 29:41.130
There's a robbery in progress.
Uh, pharmacy nearby.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.870
Suspect's description
fits your dad.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.030
What do you want to do?

29:45.070 --> 29:47.200
What I should've done
a long time ago.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.240
Let's go.

30:03.150 --> 30:04.590
What's going on?
Suspect is behind the car

30:04.620 --> 30:06.620
by the pharmacy door.

30:06.650 --> 30:08.320
Was on his way out with
a bag of drugs. He's armed.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.290
Any hostages?

30:10.330 --> 30:11.260
Alone.

30:12.630 --> 30:14.200
ERIN:
That's Lee, all right.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.130
You know him?
Yeah, we do.
This is his son.

30:16.160 --> 30:19.130
You think you can you talk to
him, get him to come out safely?

30:19.170 --> 30:20.600
Yeah, I can.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.600
Absolutely not. Our
negotiator is handling it.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.210
Well, it don't look like
he's getting anywhere.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.210
We only bring family in
as a last resort.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.540
Do you want someone
to get killed

30:27.580 --> 30:29.040
or do you want this to stop?

30:29.080 --> 30:30.110
We know him.

30:30.150 --> 30:32.010
Brian can talk him down.
Please.

30:32.050 --> 30:34.850
He's not gonna hurt anybody.
He's my dad; let me talk to him.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.020
It's gonna be okay.

30:37.050 --> 30:38.220
Go ahead.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.360
Stand down.
Civilian coming in.

30:40.390 --> 30:42.190
Stand down.
Dad.

30:43.130 --> 30:44.490
Brian! No!

30:44.530 --> 30:46.160
Go away, son!

30:46.190 --> 30:48.260
Put the gun down, Dad!

30:50.500 --> 30:53.040
Put the gun down.
You are not supposed to be here.

30:53.070 --> 30:55.370
Neither are you,
so let's both walk away.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.010
I can't.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.080
Yeah, you can.
We'll both walk away together.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.150
Brian, please.

31:05.180 --> 31:06.480
I'm walking right at you.

31:09.450 --> 31:13.360
You don't have to do this.

31:13.390 --> 31:15.320
Yeah, I do.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.130
Brian, please...

31:17.160 --> 31:19.290
There. It's okay.

31:19.330 --> 31:20.160
There.

31:22.230 --> 31:23.330
It's okay. I'm here.

31:23.370 --> 31:25.630
I'm here.

31:25.670 --> 31:27.200
Hands behind your back!
Okay, take it easy.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.640
I'm sorry, Brian.
Give me your hands.

31:32.540 --> 31:35.210
I'm sorry.

31:37.180 --> 31:39.180
Take it easy on him.

32:07.540 --> 32:10.680
I'm the one in prison.
Why would I make this up?

32:10.710 --> 32:11.580
To protect your daughter.

32:11.610 --> 32:13.180
That's ridiculous.
DANNY: Come on, Ethan.

32:13.220 --> 32:15.250
You've been lying
for 15 years, all right?

32:15.280 --> 32:17.020
It's time to start
telling the truth.

32:17.050 --> 32:19.720
You got it wrong, Detective.
So does Jessica.

32:19.750 --> 32:21.560
Jessica could lose her life
over this.

32:21.590 --> 32:23.060
Now, your daughter's
off the grid.

32:23.090 --> 32:24.730
Just tell us
where the hell she is.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.690
Lauren wouldn't hurt anybody.

32:26.730 --> 32:27.530
She wouldn't hurt anyone?

32:27.560 --> 32:29.660
No!
Like when she
came to my house

32:29.700 --> 32:31.700
and assaulted my son?!

32:31.730 --> 32:34.140
Lauren wouldn't do that.
She did that!

32:34.170 --> 32:35.600
Now where the hell is she?

32:35.640 --> 32:38.210
Do you know
what you're asking me to do?

32:38.240 --> 32:40.640
Yeah. I'm asking you
to save a life.

32:48.350 --> 32:50.650
She's all I got.

32:50.690 --> 32:52.090
DANNY:
I know.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.690
And you're never
gonna see her again,

32:54.720 --> 32:57.090
unless you tell us where she is.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.350
Go left.

33:24.790 --> 33:26.750
You okay?
Yeah.

33:26.790 --> 33:28.720
Where's Lauren?
She went down to the car.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.690
She'll be back any minute.
Over here!

33:30.730 --> 33:33.130
JESSICA:
She's got a gun, Detectives.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.130
All right, I'll go.
You stay with her.

33:35.600 --> 33:36.300
Drop it!

33:37.500 --> 33:38.300
Drop it!

33:41.170 --> 33:42.640
Stay there!

33:50.650 --> 33:52.780
Stop right there.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.820
Don't do it.

33:59.650 --> 34:00.620
Hold it!

34:00.660 --> 34:01.760
Wait, wait!

34:22.210 --> 34:24.210
It opens.

34:27.580 --> 34:30.080
What can I do for you?

34:31.790 --> 34:33.590
Be nice, for starters.

34:33.620 --> 34:36.620
I don't feel nice.
You want me to fake it?

34:36.659 --> 34:38.830
No.

34:38.860 --> 34:41.830
What happened?

34:41.860 --> 34:44.699
A man I sent to prison,

34:44.730 --> 34:47.670
who should have been sent
to rehab in the first place,

34:47.699 --> 34:51.739
is now going back to prison,
for another stint.

34:51.770 --> 34:54.179
Circle of life.

34:54.210 --> 34:55.610
I'm sorry.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.350
Well, it's not your fault.

34:57.380 --> 35:00.680
It is the fault, in part,
of a policy that needs changing.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.290
I think you know the one.

35:03.320 --> 35:07.560
I canceled my presser
denouncing your program.

35:07.590 --> 35:09.790
Yeah No one showed up?

35:09.820 --> 35:10.830
Be nice.

35:10.860 --> 35:13.760
Okay.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.860
Why?

35:15.900 --> 35:20.900
I heard one side called
fascist and cruel,

35:20.940 --> 35:23.770
the other called fairy
tales for snowflakes.

35:23.810 --> 35:26.640
Neither is true.

35:26.670 --> 35:30.280
The middle ground's
gone missing.

35:30.310 --> 35:32.310
How do you get it back?

35:34.850 --> 35:36.850
I don't know.

35:48.830 --> 35:50.830
She's gone?

35:52.700 --> 35:55.400
Yeah.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.780
This is your fault.

36:05.650 --> 36:08.450
This is on you.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.490
DANNY: She's been trying to
help you from the beginning.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.960
If it wasn't for her, my
daughter would still be alive.

36:16.990 --> 36:19.960
And she'd be looking at spending
the rest of her life in prison

36:19.990 --> 36:21.360
instead of you.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.600
Why are you even here?!

36:26.900 --> 36:31.270
For the same reason I got into
this case in the first place:

36:31.310 --> 36:33.810
to get you out of prison.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.350
DANNY: She's got all the
facts to prove you innocent.

36:38.380 --> 36:41.820
Truth is, I missed
something that...

36:41.850 --> 36:44.450
led to you being here.

36:44.490 --> 36:45.750
And no matter

36:45.790 --> 36:48.960
how good your intentions,
I cannot let that stand.

36:48.990 --> 36:52.960
What's the point?

36:52.990 --> 36:55.900
You've got a lot
of years left, Ethan.

36:58.930 --> 37:03.340
My life was for my kids.

37:05.370 --> 37:07.540
What good is it now?

37:07.580 --> 37:10.980
It's better than here.

37:11.010 --> 37:12.510
We talked to your lawyer.

37:12.550 --> 37:14.520
He's been in touch
with the D.A.,

37:14.550 --> 37:17.250
and they are working on
throwing out your conviction.

37:20.490 --> 37:23.460
Look, Ethan, we can get you
out of here in time

37:23.490 --> 37:25.790
for your daughter's funeral.

37:28.530 --> 37:31.870
Go say bye the right way.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.480
HENRY:
Wait a minute.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.450
Are you saying that the mother
called the cops

37:44.480 --> 37:45.950
on her own son?
JAMIE: Yeah.

37:45.980 --> 37:47.880
Said she was certain he was
dealing weed out of his room.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.380
Weed?
That's some tough love.

37:49.420 --> 37:51.450
That's one bad mom.
I would never do that.

37:51.490 --> 37:52.950
I would, in a heartbeat.

37:52.990 --> 37:53.990
Wait, let me finish.
SEAN:
Like we don't know that.

37:54.020 --> 37:55.860
Let me finish.
Good.

37:55.890 --> 37:57.930
So we go into his room,
we go into the kid's room,

37:57.960 --> 38:00.800
he's not there, and lying out
on the bed is a big Ziploc.

38:00.830 --> 38:02.100
And so I take one sniff,

38:02.130 --> 38:03.930
and I'm hungry for
chicken cutlets all of a sudden.

38:03.970 --> 38:05.400
Like, munchies?

38:05.430 --> 38:06.530
Munchies?
Munchies?

38:06.570 --> 38:07.600
What do you know
about the munchies?

38:07.640 --> 38:09.040
FRANK: Yeah.
Yeah.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.610
No, not munchies,
like, uh, Italian seasoning.

38:11.640 --> 38:12.970
JAMIE:
So she must've taken, like,

38:13.010 --> 38:15.710
a vat of Italian seasoning,
put it in a Ziploc,

38:15.740 --> 38:18.350
laid it out on the kid's bed
and said it's weed.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.010
Oh, planting evidence
on your own kid?

38:20.050 --> 38:21.520
That's really tough love.

38:21.550 --> 38:23.590
So what'd you say?
I said, "Ma'am,"

38:23.620 --> 38:26.990
giving her one of these,
and she burst into tears.

38:27.020 --> 38:29.360
Oh, now, are these real tears
or fake tears?

38:29.390 --> 38:31.130
No, the tears are real.
She starts hyperventilating.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.990
Eddie goes to get her
a glass of water...

38:33.030 --> 38:34.430
Is this story going somewhere?

38:34.460 --> 38:37.000
Yeah. She gets a grip
and she spills her guts.

38:37.030 --> 38:39.000
Said she loves him,
but living with him

38:39.030 --> 38:40.740
has become like a life sentence.

38:40.770 --> 38:42.070
ERIN:
How old is this woman?

38:42.100 --> 38:44.910
Mid-50s.
Then the front door slams.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.070
Our cruiser's parked out front,
and the kid comes

38:47.110 --> 38:48.640
tear-assing up the stairs,

38:48.680 --> 38:50.040
yelling,
"Mom, Mom, are you okay?"

38:51.010 --> 38:52.710
And the kid, he's not a kid.

38:52.750 --> 38:53.780
What?

38:53.820 --> 38:54.780
He's, like, late 30s.

38:54.820 --> 38:56.080
FRANK: Oh, my gosh.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.180
And here's what he's wearing:
sneakers and shorts

38:57.220 --> 38:59.150
and a Mets cap on backwards.
Okay, I'm with the mom.

38:59.190 --> 39:01.720
And this isn't the first time
she's done this?

39:01.760 --> 39:02.920
No, or even the tenth.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.160
Wow.
They start going at it.

39:04.190 --> 39:05.630
We got to separate them.

39:05.660 --> 39:07.630
I take the kid...
I mean, the son... outside.

39:07.660 --> 39:09.130
I go, "Dude, when your own mom"

39:09.160 --> 39:10.630
"is trying to frame you
for possession

39:10.670 --> 39:12.170
just to get you
out of the house..."

39:12.200 --> 39:14.570
I'm assuming he didn't
get the message.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.870
I wouldn't put money on it.

39:15.900 --> 39:18.070
But the point is...
What is the point?

39:18.110 --> 39:21.410
For us, is there a line
for what you'll do for family?

39:21.440 --> 39:23.040
No.
No.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.150
Huh.

39:24.180 --> 39:25.080
No.
Nope.

39:25.110 --> 39:26.910
Seriously? 'Cause that sounds

39:26.950 --> 39:28.650
a little less than honest.

39:28.680 --> 39:32.450
Well, suppose we just make
a deal, amongst ourselves,

39:32.490 --> 39:34.590
never to test
where that line exits.

39:34.620 --> 39:35.760
All in favor?

39:35.790 --> 39:36.890
Aye.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.030
ALL:
Aye.

39:38.060 --> 39:39.630
FRANK:
Hear, hear.
