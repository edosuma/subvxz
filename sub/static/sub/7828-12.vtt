00:39.887 --> 00:42.556
- Looks like you got a leak.
- Could you start fixing it?

00:42.723 --> 00:47.468
The basement is getting awfully flooded.
And I think the cat's down there.

00:48.145 --> 00:52.357
Yeah, I probably won't be able to get
the parts I need for two, three weeks.

00:52.566 --> 00:54.559
And that's if I order them today.

00:54.777 --> 00:58.270
- Which I won't.
- Oh, dear.

01:00.324 --> 01:02.320
Emergency call. Gotta go.

01:02.242 --> 01:06.406
- What should we do until you get back?
- Put a pan down there.

01:11.850 --> 01:12.413
It didn't work.

01:15.798 --> 01:18.205
Lousy traffic jams.

01:18.425 --> 01:21.343
The traffic report will
get me out of this one.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.428
This is Ernie Pie.

01:23.639 --> 01:28.680
We got a little accident that's backing
traffic up as far as this reporter can see.

01:37.945 --> 01:39.688
Hi, Dad.

01:46.537 --> 01:50.237
Hey, how come you guys
got such great parking places?

01:50.457 --> 01:53.244
- It's a secret.
- Shut up.

02:01.969 --> 02:05.219
All right, Econo-Save,
you just made the list.

02:10.102 --> 02:12.344
Hey, will you guys help me fix my...?

02:14.106 --> 02:18.200
Hey, how come you guys
got better chairs than me?

02:18.235 --> 02:20.904
- It's a secret.
- Shut up.

02:26.952 --> 02:28.779
Hey, you guys
wanna go bowling tonight?

02:28.996 --> 02:31.617
- No, we're busy.
- Yeah, we got things to do.

02:31.832 --> 02:33.575
Like what?

02:33.792 --> 02:35.915
It's a secret.

02:36.253 --> 02:38.246
Shut up.

02:40.174 --> 02:42.546
So Lenny and Carl are never
around on Wednesdays.

02:42.718 --> 02:45.470
They don't tell me where they go.
It's like a conspiracy.

02:45.638 --> 02:49.718
A conspiracy, eh? You think they're
involved in the Kennedy assassination?

02:49.933 --> 02:52.341
I do now.

02:52.561 --> 02:55.182
I'm gonna follow them tonight
and see where they go.

02:55.397 --> 02:59.644
Oh, Homer, don't start stalking
people again. It's so illegal.

02:59.818 --> 03:03.152
You stalked Charles Kuralt because
you thought he dug up your garden.

03:03.364 --> 03:06.863
- Well, something did.
- I don't want you stalking anyone.

03:07.340 --> 03:09.525
Oh, okay.
Have it your own way, Marge.

03:09.745 --> 03:11.453
I'll be back in a minute.

03:11.664 --> 03:14.748
I'm going outside...

03:14.958 --> 03:17.496
...to stalk...

03:17.711 --> 03:20.629
...Lenny and Carl...

03:37.564 --> 03:40.768
All I have to do
is follow the yellow-drip road.

03:47.366 --> 03:50.283
- There's our secret meeting place.
- Yes. Let's go inside.

03:50.452 --> 03:52.362
Sounds good.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.295
I can see everything
and they're none the wiser.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.937
- An intruder!
- He will pay the ultimate price.

04:23.152 --> 04:25.690
Yes, the ultimate price.

04:25.904 --> 04:28.656
Get out of here!

04:31.368 --> 04:33.824
I saw weird stuff
in that place last night.

04:34.380 --> 04:39.320
Weird, strange, sick, twisted, eerie,
godless, evil stuff. And I want in.

04:39.251 --> 04:41.458
We don't know what
you're talking about, Homer.

04:41.628 --> 04:44.202
You can't join the Stonecutters.
It's too exclusive.

04:44.381 --> 04:45.875
Oh, well.

04:46.910 --> 04:48.761
That was a real nice
secret organization we had once.

04:48.969 --> 04:50.677
Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?

04:50.888 --> 04:52.715
There are two ways
to gain membership:

04:52.931 --> 04:55.800
- Be the son of a Stonecutter.
- Next.

04:55.225 --> 04:57.990
Or save the life of a Stonecutter.

04:57.311 --> 04:58.722
Hey!

04:59.396 --> 05:03.524
I saved your life. That egg sandwich
could've killed you by cholesterol.

05:03.734 --> 05:07.317
Forget it, Homer. While it has been
established eggs contain cholesterol...

05:07.488 --> 05:10.275
...it has not been proven
that they raise the level...

05:10.491 --> 05:12.898
...of serum cholesterol
in the human bloodstream.

05:13.118 --> 05:15.158
Those Egg Council creeps
got to you too?

05:15.371 --> 05:19.238
Oh, you got it all wrong, Homer.
It's not like that.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.459
You'd better run, egg!

05:22.753 --> 05:24.746
Why don't people like me, Marge?

05:24.964 --> 05:27.799
Everyone likes you.
You're a wonderful person.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.930
Why don't those stupid idiots
let me in their crappy club for jerks?

05:31.303 --> 05:33.794
- I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer.
- It is.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.636
It's been happening to me all my life.

05:39.190 --> 05:42.768
Hey, Billy, hey, Joey, come on in.
There's plenty of room.

05:42.982 --> 05:45.817
- Sorry. Not you, Homer.
- Why not?

05:48.487 --> 05:50.563
But you let in Homer Glumpet.

05:50.781 --> 05:53.782
It says "no Homers."

05:53.993 --> 05:55.451
We're allowed to have one.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.570
I felt so left out.

05:59.790 --> 06:04.333
- Kids can be so cruel.
- We can? Thanks, Mom.

06:04.628 --> 06:07.000
Cut it out, Bart!

06:07.631 --> 06:09.956
I'd give anything
to get into the Stonecutters.

06:10.175 --> 06:12.382
- What do they do there, Dad?
- I'm a member.

06:12.594 --> 06:15.264
What do they do?
What don't they do?

06:15.472 --> 06:17.880
Oh, they do so many things,
they never stop.

06:18.100 --> 06:22.180
- Oh, the things they do there. My stars.
- You don't know what they do, do you?

06:22.396 --> 06:24.389
- Not as such, no.
- I'm a Stonecutter.

06:24.606 --> 06:28.272
Remember those self-hypnosis classes
we took to help us ignore Grampa?

06:28.485 --> 06:31.605
Do I ever. It's five years later
and I still think I'm a chicken.

06:31.822 --> 06:34.280
- I'm a chicken, Marge.
- I know, I know.

06:34.241 --> 06:36.115
Maybe we should be
listening to him now.

06:36.327 --> 06:38.153
I'm a member!

06:38.329 --> 06:40.360
- What?
- What?

06:40.205 --> 06:42.281
You're a member of
the Stonecutters, Grampa?

06:42.499 --> 06:44.741
Oh, sure. Let's see.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.800
I'm an Elk, a Mason, a Communist.

06:48.297 --> 06:52.247
I'm the president of the Gay & Lesbian
Alliance, for some reason.

06:52.468 --> 06:55.587
Here it is. The Stonecutters.

06:55.804 --> 06:57.429
This is it. My ticket in.

06:57.639 --> 07:00.131
They have to let me join
if I'm the son of a member.

07:00.351 --> 07:02.758
I'll take this Communist one too.

07:03.562 --> 07:06.598
Coming through. Can't throw me out.
My father's a member.

07:06.815 --> 07:09.271
- I'm in, I'm in.
- Okay, okay, Homer, you're in.

07:09.485 --> 07:11.145
Just don't point that thing at me.

07:11.362 --> 07:14.446
Thanks, Lenny.
When am I gonna be initiated?

07:14.657 --> 07:18.108
- As soon as Number One gets here.
- Number One?

07:18.327 --> 07:21.790
What kind of stupid
wiener name is that?

07:21.288 --> 07:25.831
"Hello, my name is Number One."

07:26.293 --> 07:27.835
And so forth.

07:28.450 --> 07:29.504
We call each other by number.

07:29.672 --> 07:32.838
Carl is Number 14, I'm Number 12.
Burnsie is Number 29.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.458
- You outrank Mr. Burns here?
- Sure. Watch.

07:35.678 --> 07:38.465
Hey, 29, get over here!

07:41.725 --> 07:43.718
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

07:46.647 --> 07:49.683
Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder.

07:51.694 --> 07:53.935
- Is he the leader?
- Of this chapter.

07:54.113 --> 07:57.279
There are chapters all over the world.
And it has been foretold...

07:57.449 --> 07:59.359
...that someday a Chosen One will...

07:59.576 --> 08:02.320
Okay, okay. I didn't ask
for your life story.

08:05.290 --> 08:07.782
Let the initiation begin.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.121
All Stonecutters must take
the Leap of Faith.

08:11.338 --> 08:16.296
If you survive this five-story plunge,
your character will be proven.

08:17.636 --> 08:18.965
Happy landings!

08:31.442 --> 08:35.486
I think I have to do it again.
My blindfold came off.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.696
This ritual is called
Crossing the Desert.

08:41.827 --> 08:45.694
And this we call the Unblinking Eye.

08:48.167 --> 08:50.918
Hey, have you ever noticed
that the Crossing the Desert...

08:51.128 --> 08:52.836
...is a lot like the Unblinking Eye?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.247
And exactly like
the Wreck of the Hesperus.

08:55.466 --> 08:57.209
And now the final ordeal:

08:57.384 --> 09:01.299
The Paddling of the Swollen Ass,
with paddles.

09:04.933 --> 09:09.140
And by the sacred parchment,
I swear that if I reveal the secrets...

09:09.229 --> 09:11.899
...of the Stonecutters,
may my stomach become bloated...

09:12.107 --> 09:15.607
...and my head be plucked
of all but three hairs.

09:15.819 --> 09:17.646
He should have to take
a different oath.

09:17.863 --> 09:19.654
Everyone takes the same oath.

09:19.865 --> 09:22.403
Welcome to the club, Number 908.

09:22.618 --> 09:25.323
You have joined the Sacred Order
of the Stonecutters...

09:25.537 --> 09:28.574
...who since ancient times
have split the rocks of ignorance...

09:28.749 --> 09:31.418
...that obscure the light
of knowledge and truth.

09:31.627 --> 09:34.340
Now let's all get drunk
and play Ping-Pong.

09:35.506 --> 09:37.629
He's already kind of heavy,
you know, and...

09:40.928 --> 09:44.676
Well, to be honest, I never got around
to ordering that part for you.

09:44.890 --> 09:47.346
So it's still gonna be
a couple of weeks.

09:47.559 --> 09:50.477
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

09:50.688 --> 09:53.392
- Really?
- Yes. Yes.

09:53.607 --> 09:57.475
But what if I were to shake your hand
in this way?

10:01.573 --> 10:03.732
Well, I didn't realize
you were a member.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.536
So long, suckers.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.490
- Same old space, huh, Dad?
- Yep.

10:28.225 --> 10:33.765
But they gave me these Rollerblades
so I can glide to the front door.

10:37.443 --> 10:38.771
Sweet.

10:41.697 --> 10:45.148
- Jealous?
- Well, no. We've got the same chair.

10:45.367 --> 10:46.826
You're jealous.

10:47.411 --> 10:50.246
- Your membership pack.
- What's this?

10:50.456 --> 10:52.994
You put that on your car
so you won't get any tickets.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.616
This keeps paramedics
from stealing your wallet.

10:55.836 --> 10:59.537
Oh, and don't bother calling 911
anymore. Here's the real number.

11:03.635 --> 11:07.870
I still don't believe all the
Founding Fathers were Stonecutters.

11:07.306 --> 11:10.930
That's because you trust
your stupid schoolbooks.

11:10.309 --> 11:12.467
Here's what really happened
at the signing...

11:12.645 --> 11:14.970
...of the Declaration of Independence.

11:17.191 --> 11:19.896
And a nation is born.

11:20.110 --> 11:24.190
Now let us party like 'twere 1799!

11:25.908 --> 11:30.360
Quaff! Quaff! Quaff!

11:33.165 --> 11:36.000
Please, sir. You're destroying
my establishment.

11:36.168 --> 11:41.755
We just created the greatest democracy
on earth, lowlife commoner! Get out!

11:41.924 --> 11:45.507
Wanna see how Davy Crockett really
died at the Alamo? You must be 18.

11:46.178 --> 11:49.132
Homer, a man who called himself
"you know who"...

11:49.306 --> 11:52.841
...just invited you to a secret
"wink-wink" at the "you know what."

11:53.180 --> 11:55.343
Sure are popular
now that you're a Stonecutter.

11:55.521 --> 12:00.681
Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts,
keggers, stein hoist...

12:00.859 --> 12:02.733
...AA meetings, beer night.

12:02.903 --> 12:07.861
It's wonderful, Marge. I've never
felt so accepted in all my life.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.358
These people look
deep within my soul...

12:10.536 --> 12:15.328
...and assign me a number
based on the order in which I joined.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.834
Who controls the British crown?
Who keeps the metric system down?

12:24.800 --> 12:28.880
We do
We do

12:28.304 --> 12:32.432
Who leaves Atlantis off the maps?
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

12:32.599 --> 12:36.265
We do
We do

12:36.687 --> 12:40.685
Who holds back the electric car?

12:40.858 --> 12:45.690
Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?

12:45.237 --> 12:49.317
We do
We do

12:49.491 --> 12:53.489
Who robs cavefish of their sight?
Who rigs every Oscar night?

12:53.662 --> 12:56.747
We do

12:56.915 --> 13:00.699
We do

13:01.670 --> 13:03.746
Thank you. Tonight we are here...

13:03.922 --> 13:07.706
...to commemorate our glorious
society's 1500th anniversary.

13:07.926 --> 13:10.762
And in honor of this
momentous occasion...

13:10.929 --> 13:14.429
...we're having ribs.
- Yeah!

13:16.643 --> 13:21.222
I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt,
I could lose the respect of my brethren.

13:21.398 --> 13:23.307
So let us rejoice and enjoy our meal...

13:23.484 --> 13:28.726
...in the shadow of the hallowed
sacred parchment.

13:31.750 --> 13:35.238
- Homer.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, Lenny.

13:35.663 --> 13:37.988
This is just appalling and outrageous.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.371
What? Did I miss something?

13:42.586 --> 13:43.914
Oh, God!

13:44.880 --> 13:46.839
No, Homer, no! This is outrageous!
You can't do that!

13:47.490 --> 13:50.300
- No!
- You really are stupid.

13:54.390 --> 13:57.426
And the official Stonecutter
underwear too.

14:04.274 --> 14:07.145
Please don't kick me out.
This society's everything to me.

14:07.319 --> 14:10.190
Please give me another chance.
I've learned my lesson!

14:10.364 --> 14:12.771
I've learned my lesson!

14:13.826 --> 14:15.534
That's it!

14:15.703 --> 14:17.861
- How can we punish him further?
- Oh, sorry.

14:18.380 --> 14:22.700
Homer Simpson, for your continuing
and baffling desecration...

14:22.876 --> 14:25.202
...of our beloved sacred parchment...

14:25.379 --> 14:29.127
...you are hereby banished
from the Stonecutters forever.

14:29.299 --> 14:33.796
And as a final humiliation,
you must walk home naked...

14:33.971 --> 14:37.921
...dragging behind you
the Stone of Shame.

14:46.859 --> 14:48.187
The mark!

14:49.695 --> 14:53.278
Oh, that. It's just a birthmark.
And I'll thank you not to stare.

14:53.490 --> 14:56.160
He's the Chosen One.

14:57.911 --> 15:00.284
You are the Chosen One...

15:00.456 --> 15:05.340
...whom the sacred parchment
prophesied would lead us to glory.

15:05.294 --> 15:09.374
Now to the top of Mount Springfield
for the coronation.

15:09.548 --> 15:12.751
Remove the Stone of Shame.

15:12.968 --> 15:16.966
Attach the Stone of Triumph!

15:33.989 --> 15:35.697
Mental note: Don't overdo this.

15:42.539 --> 15:43.571
Peekaboo!

15:48.587 --> 15:50.544
I always wondered
if there was a God.

15:50.714 --> 15:53.549
And now I know.
There is, and it's me.

15:53.717 --> 15:57.585
- You're not a god, Homer.
- Remember, Dad, all glory is fleeting.

15:57.763 --> 16:00.680
- So?
- Beware the Ides of March.

16:00.849 --> 16:02.509
- No.
- I know you're happy now...

16:02.685 --> 16:05.520
...but it won't last forever.
- Everything lasts forever.

16:05.688 --> 16:10.650
Getting what you want all the time
will leave you unfulfilled and joyless.

16:10.234 --> 16:11.562
Remove the girl.

16:11.777 --> 16:16.320
You're not with your Stonecutters. There
are no lackeys around to carry out your...

16:23.831 --> 16:25.740
Another strike for the Chosen One!

16:25.916 --> 16:27.909
Hurrah!

16:34.258 --> 16:35.752
That's just an excellent break.

16:35.926 --> 16:38.547
- Oh, most assuredly.
- Absolutely.

16:46.312 --> 16:48.185
- I'm out.
- No, no, no. Homer...

16:48.355 --> 16:51.475
...you have a royal sampler.

16:51.650 --> 16:54.734
Oh, I win again, don't I?

16:55.154 --> 16:57.609
- Good one.
- Nice hand, Chosen One.

16:57.781 --> 17:00.700
You know, I think you guys
are letting me win.

17:00.242 --> 17:03.825
No! No! No!

17:03.996 --> 17:06.451
From now on I want you
to be honest with me.

17:06.623 --> 17:08.450
I mean, I'm not perfect, right?

17:10.877 --> 17:13.962
- Yeah.
- Well...

17:18.301 --> 17:19.962
Run.

17:25.184 --> 17:27.971
The grand exalted leader
requests a moment of your time.

17:28.561 --> 17:30.685
Class dismissed.

17:34.318 --> 17:37.438
Lisa, you were right.
My happiness is fading.

17:37.613 --> 17:41.361
You're experiencing spiritual emptiness
because your power has isolated you...

17:41.533 --> 17:45.317
...from other human beings.
- What do you mean, isolated?

17:47.164 --> 17:51.328
Well, maybe you could reach out to
the community and help other people.

17:51.835 --> 17:54.457
I could help others.

17:54.630 --> 18:00.860
I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them
up and make them reenact the Civil War.

18:00.260 --> 18:01.920
Dad, that doesn't help people.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.381
Couldn't hurt. Unless the monkeys
started hurting people.

18:05.557 --> 18:08.950
Which they almost certainly would.

18:12.940 --> 18:14.434
Brothers. Brothers!

18:16.485 --> 18:19.936
Brothers, I've learned
a wonderful lesson.

18:20.114 --> 18:24.776
Helping others makes our own lives
better and makes us better people.

18:24.952 --> 18:28.720
So instead of just shooting pool
and drinking beer...

18:28.247 --> 18:32.909
...let us Stonecutters use what we have
to help the less fortunate.

18:36.672 --> 18:40.372
He's gone mad with power,
like that Albert Schweitzer guy.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.590
Oh, for the love of God!

18:53.230 --> 18:54.428
Somebody get the Jaws of Life!

18:58.402 --> 19:01.522
Higher! Higher!

19:01.697 --> 19:04.235
Oh, I'll give you higher,
my filthy little urchin.

19:09.455 --> 19:12.124
You've won this round.

19:17.171 --> 19:20.255
Oh, thank you, Mr. Simpson.

19:20.424 --> 19:22.713
It looks so much better.

19:22.885 --> 19:25.969
A beautiful sky blue.

19:27.973 --> 19:32.884
You were right, Lisa.
I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.897
And with my brothers
the Stonecutters behind me...

19:36.650 --> 19:39.979
...this is the beginning
of a better world for all of us.

19:40.194 --> 19:42.436
- We gotta kill him!
- Take it easy, Moe.

19:42.613 --> 19:46.824
Let's hear from the Stonecutter World
Council before we act too rashly.

19:46.992 --> 19:48.403
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

19:48.577 --> 19:50.949
- Kill the fool!
- Afraid I have to disagree...

19:51.121 --> 19:55.867
...with Orville, Jack and Mister. Can't
we just do something to his voice box?

19:56.850 --> 19:57.994
We might as well face the truth.

19:58.170 --> 20:02.370
As long as we're Stonecutters,
he will control our lives.

20:02.216 --> 20:06.593
Maybe. But maybe we don't
wanna be Stonecutters no more.

20:12.226 --> 20:15.844
This is much better than
the old Stonecutter hall.

20:16.210 --> 20:19.141
Silence. I now call to order
the first meeting...

20:19.316 --> 20:22.353
...of the ancient, mystic society of...

20:22.528 --> 20:23.856
...No Homers.

20:26.824 --> 20:28.733
Hey, fellas. Can I join?

20:28.909 --> 20:32.112
Sorry. No Homers.

20:33.956 --> 20:35.616
Loyal Stonecutters...

20:35.791 --> 20:39.539
...let us begin our reenactment
of the Battle of Gettysburg.

20:42.172 --> 20:45.755
Homer, you can't just keep hanging out
with these Colobus monkeys.

20:45.926 --> 20:48.417
Somebody's gonna get parasites.

20:48.595 --> 20:52.470
Oh, Marge, kids, I miss my club.

20:52.224 --> 20:55.110
Oh, Homie.

20:55.185 --> 20:59.313
You know, you are a member
of a very exclusive club.

20:59.481 --> 21:03.313
- The Black Panthers?
- No, the family Simpson...

21:03.485 --> 21:05.858
...which has just five members.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.944
And only two of those members
have special rings.

21:10.159 --> 21:12.365
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

21:13.162 --> 21:14.953
I meant our wedding rings!

21:16.749 --> 21:18.706
You know, Marge, you're right.

21:18.876 --> 21:24.581
The Simpson family is the best
possible club I could belong to.

21:29.678 --> 21:32.383
This club better be worth it.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.506
All right, all right, it's Lisa's turn.

21:46.445 --> 21:50.443
Who controls the British crown?
Who keeps the metric system down?

21:50.616 --> 21:54.696
We do
We do

21:54.870 --> 21:58.915
Who keeps Atlantis off the maps?
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

21:59.830 --> 22:03.163
We do
We do

22:03.337 --> 22:07.335
Who holds back the electric car?

22:07.508 --> 22:11.588
Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?

22:11.762 --> 22:15.807
We do
We do

22:15.974 --> 22:19.972
Who robs cavefish of their sight?
Who rigs every Oscar night?

22:20.145 --> 22:23.146
We do

22:23.315 --> 22:27.182
We do

22:28.195 --> 22:30.690
Shut up.

22:31.281 --> 22:33.357
