01:35.621 --> 01:37.288
There is no news.

01:37.355 --> 01:38.556
I wouldn't say being asked

01:38.623 --> 01:40.858
to be the subject
of an on‐air TV interview

at our house next week

They're never gonna believe it.
Tell 'em, tell 'em.

01:49.633 --> 01:53.336
It's a lil' puff piece for that
TV show, "Black Visionaries."

01:53.402 --> 01:54.803
‐ Ooh.
‐ Mmm.

01:54.870 --> 01:57.005
You know, they interview all
the prominent African‐Americans

01:57.072 --> 01:59.841

Hmm, note to Sabrina.

from "Black Visionaries."

agreed to do it.

I mean, I'm a behind‐the‐scenes
kind of person.

02:20.365 --> 02:23.768
The truth is Khadijah stinks
at public speaking.

02:23.835 --> 02:27.137
I got a little speech for you.

02:27.204 --> 02:29.807
Anyway, in junior high
she had to give this speech..

02:29.873 --> 02:32.875
...and so she got up, wobbling
in her first pair of heels

02:32.942 --> 02:36.245
and she said,
"Principal H‐H‐Hernandez

02:36.312 --> 02:38.614

02:38.680 --> 02:44.019
And then, the girl fell out
her shoes and off the stage.

02:44.085 --> 02:46.321
Khadijah, you know,
it might be good for Flavor.

you talked me into those shoes

Kyle, why don't you sing next
week in the Open Mike contest?

04:05.434 --> 04:09.071
Come on, you could at least
beat Puddin', if not Fudge.

04:10.705 --> 04:12.707
Yeah. Who knows
where this could lead?

Hey, can somebody give me
a hand with this?

11:42.300 --> 11:44.802
Man, this is the biggest trophy
I ever seen.

11:44.869 --> 11:46.804
Now, Kyle, don't feel bad.

11:46.871 --> 11:49.006
You still have your dignity.

11:49.073 --> 11:51.107
Oh, no, you really don't,
do you?

11:51.174 --> 11:53.777
Oh‐h‐h! Ha‐ha‐ha!

11:53.844 --> 11:56.079
Why you gonna kick that man
when he's down?

11:56.146 --> 11:59.549
I'm sorry, but watching Kyle
humiliate himself in public..

11:59.615 --> 12:01.957
...it's got me kind of giddy.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.234
Oh, face it, man.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.636
Anybody who's ever
been on stage before

12:16.703 --> 12:19.238
has flopped
at one time or another.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.672

12:20.739 --> 12:22.374
Except for me,
of course.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.376
I'm batting a thousand
but then again

12:24.443 --> 12:28.213
that's an unfair comparison.

12:28.279 --> 12:30.247
Overton, man,
I completely lost it up there

12:30.315 --> 12:32.616
and why'd have
to be in front of Max?

12:32.683 --> 12:34.751
I'm never gonna hear
the end of this.

12:34.818 --> 12:37.320
You know, I think my avid
viewing of Ricki Lake

12:37.387 --> 12:40.189
is about to pay off.

12:40.256 --> 12:43.258
Kyle, I think Max is the reason
why you cracked on stage.

12:43.326 --> 12:46.061
Please, come on, man.
It'd take a lot more than her.

12:46.128 --> 12:48.630
As any Oprah fan
would tell you..

12:48.696 --> 12:51.165
...man, you in denial.
Let's face it.

12:51.232 --> 12:53.167
You and Max
have been intimate.

12:53.234 --> 12:57.003
You inoculated the cat. You took
Mr. Toad for the wild ride.

12:57.070 --> 13:00.213
‐ Y'all was doing the‐‐
‐ Ha‐ha! Okay!

13:02.315 --> 13:04.449
And yes, we did discuss
having a relationship

13:04.516 --> 13:05.818
but good sense prevailed

13:05.885 --> 13:09.621
allowing us to maintain
our mutual disgust.

13:09.688 --> 13:12.623
So, what I'm hearing here is..

13:12.690 --> 13:16.126
...you tried to get closer to
Max and she closed the doors.

13:16.193 --> 13:20.497
She cut you off,
she hung up the emotion phone.

13:20.563 --> 13:24.033
Or at least,
that's how Donahue would say it.

13:24.100 --> 13:27.869
Overton, man, I thought I had
put all this stuff behind me.

13:27.936 --> 13:29.605
Well, clearly you haven't.

13:29.671 --> 13:32.940
So what you got to do now
is get back on that stage

13:33.008 --> 13:35.242
in front of Max
and the other 50 people

13:35.309 --> 13:38.212
that laughed your ass up
out of there...and sing.

13:38.278 --> 13:39.579
I'll tell you another thing.

13:39.646 --> 13:42.381
I think the reason why Max
didn't hook up with you

13:42.449 --> 13:43.750
is 'cause she's scared.

13:43.817 --> 13:44.784
[snorts]

13:49.021 --> 13:50.555
You think so?

13:50.622 --> 13:53.358
Well, it's either that, or
she's just not attracted to you.

13:57.394 --> 13:59.363
Synclaire, would you mind
sitting in for Khadijah

13:59.430 --> 14:00.564
while we adjust lighting?

14:00.631 --> 14:03.439
Oh, I could never
take Khadijah's place.

14:03.506 --> 14:06.209
I'd love to!

14:06.276 --> 14:08.511
You know,
you're pretty photogenic.

Damn! Look at all this
equipment. I'm not ready.

14:24.491 --> 14:26.993
Listen, if you find yourself
at a loss for words

14:27.059 --> 14:29.762
simply thank God and your family
for all the opportunities

14:29.829 --> 14:34.600
that you've been given,
and then the big smile.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.935
Khadijah, we're ready for you.
You look fantastic.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.303
Thank you!

14:43.974 --> 14:46.710
So, just pretend we're
two old friends chatting

14:46.776 --> 14:49.612
and I'll ask you
a few simple questions.

14:49.678 --> 14:52.014
Excuse me,
if you were old friends

14:52.080 --> 14:54.683
wouldn't you know the answers
to all the questions?

14:55.784 --> 14:57.085
[clears throat]

14:57.152 --> 15:00.221
So what is it like being
a young African‐American woman

15:00.287 --> 15:02.696
in charge of her own magazine?

15:02.763 --> 15:03.730
Nice.

15:07.701 --> 15:10.370
Um, it's very nice.

15:13.639 --> 15:15.807
Um, um, it's excellent.

I‐I like it.

15:18.643 --> 15:20.579
Why don't I ask you
something easier?

Now, for those viewers
who haven't been lucky enough

15:22.947 --> 15:26.116
to have read Flavor Magazine,
how would you describe it?

15:26.183 --> 15:28.785
Um, it's a magazine
that's called "Flavor"

they've done for me.

making me look really bad.

"Flavor" magazine
paints a portrait

16:22.036 --> 16:23.972
of the young African‐American

16:24.038 --> 16:28.076
against a changing
urban landscape.

to a community

otherwise be heard.
