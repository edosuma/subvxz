NARRATOR: <i>Last week an</i> Night Court,
<i>there was trouble for the Blakes.</i>

00:04.738 --> 00:08.606
Your Honor, Mrs. Blake returned from work
and found an eviction notice on her door.

00:08.775 --> 00:13.736
I got a simple policy:
you don't pay, you don't stay.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.916
I made that up myself.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.185
We just moved here.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.048
We don't know anyone.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.518
Can't you help us?

00:23.056 --> 00:25.423
<i>And there was trouble fur the Wheelers.</i>

00:25.592 --> 00:28.892
Your Honor, the Wheelers were found
on a park bench crying.

00:29.062 --> 00:30.894
They were arrested for vagrancy.

00:31.064 --> 00:36.002
Will I ever see Disney World now, Daddy?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.634
Never, sweetheart.

00:39.606 --> 00:42.735
Never in a million years.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.370
- This took so long, I'm frightened.
- Oh, don't worry, Mrs. Blake.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.040
I have a feeling
we're about to see some magic.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.977
The State finds the defendant
guilty as charged.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.646
Ta-da.

00:55.822 --> 00:56.914
Take it easy, kid.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.821
I'll take it any way I can get it.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.188
You're a pig!

01:04.864 --> 01:07.163
Remember that lady and her kid
from last night?

01:07.334 --> 01:10.395
- Yeah.
- Kid tried to rob a liquor store on Broadway.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.762
So he got arrested?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.972
He got shot.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.271
Uh, Your Honor?

01:23.050 --> 01:25.382
If it's about the kid, he heard already.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.146
- The cops gave him a call.
- When?

01:28.322 --> 01:30.313
Few minutes ago.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.922
Right before he quit.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.459
That's right, officer.
He's been missing since last night.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.227
Let's see, he's tall, he's skinny...

01:42.402 --> 01:45.770
...he's wearing along black robe
and blue suede shoes.

01:46.306 --> 01:49.901
Oh, and there's a possibility
he's got a stuffed armadillo with him.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.738
Hello?

01:51.912 --> 01:55.314
- We get that a lot with Harry.
- Any word from the hospital, Mac?

01:55.482 --> 01:58.577
Yeah, I just talked to them.
The kid came through fine.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.221
- Oh. Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.651
Now the only problem is...

02:02.823 --> 02:05.884
...the one man that needs to hear that
has vanished into thin air.

02:06.059 --> 02:09.256
Mac, where is he? It's driving me crazy.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.833
Well, he's not in Manhattan.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.291
Bull.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.834
Are you all right?

02:17.437 --> 02:19.098
I checked everywhere.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.798
I checked his apartment, no luck.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.704
I checked his favorite restaurants...

02:23.877 --> 02:27.575
...all the magic shops, the toy stores,
the parks, the zoo.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.648
Is that seaweed on your lapel?

02:29.816 --> 02:33.184
You swam around the whole island,
didn't you?

02:34.454 --> 02:36.388
And the last few miles were the hardest.

02:36.556 --> 02:38.524
I felt like I was pulling a lead weight.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.424
Bull, what are those little round marks
on the back of your uniform?

02:43.063 --> 02:45.088
Tentacles?

02:48.101 --> 02:51.196
That's what they were yelling
from shore.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.179
MAC:
Uh-huh. Yeah.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.253
Well, okay, thanks anyway.

03:42.789 --> 03:46.248
What did you tell them at city hall
when you asked for a replacement judge?

03:46.426 --> 03:50.488
Well, last night I said Harry had to leave
because his place had a flood.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.326
Tonight,
I went with a death in the family.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.524
Mac.

03:54.701 --> 03:58.296
I know.
this is how Pinocchio got started.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.167
Well...

04:01.341 --> 04:03.105
...he's not at the morgue.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.438
You looked for Judge Stone
at the morgue?

04:05.612 --> 04:08.445
Yeah, I got a friend who works there.

04:08.615 --> 04:12.609
As a matter of fact,
I got about a dozen friends who work there.

04:13.053 --> 04:16.546
We sit around swapping recipes,
we play board games.

04:16.723 --> 04:20.284
They even gave me a spare locker
to keep my things in.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.861
You know how some people
like the park?

04:23.029 --> 04:26.294
Me, I like the morgue.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.329
Getting to know you.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.737
Getting to know all about you.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.241
All rise.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.670
Criminal Court Part Two
is now in session.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.541
The honorable--

04:42.182 --> 04:44.651
[YAWNS]

04:46.319 --> 04:47.684
--Harrison Kemp presiding .

04:47.854 --> 04:49.322
You okay?

04:49.489 --> 04:53.426
Yeah, Mr. Sandman didn't get a chance
to visit me last night.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.358
Probably afraid to come in.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.901
- Tonight's docket, sir.
- Thank you.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.092
[BANGS]

05:03.270 --> 05:04.669
Ow!

05:06.673 --> 05:07.970
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.543
That belongs to the judge
who usually presides here.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.241
Evening.

05:15.015 --> 05:20.476
Well, if it isn't
Mr. and Mrs. Night of the Living Dead.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.753
Just so you know,
we're looking for a ride to Florida.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.693
If we have to, we can split the gas.

05:30.864 --> 05:34.164
My wife have is willing to sell her hair.

05:39.472 --> 05:43.807
I've always considered it
just a luxury item.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.310
So many of us forget that.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.509
We spent the night at the mission.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.587
It was the most beautiful place
on the face of the earth.

05:54.754 --> 05:57.689
They gave us a slice of olive loaf.

05:59.259 --> 06:02.923
And the entertainment portion
of the evening was a true pleasure.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.564
Entertainment?

06:04.731 --> 06:08.759
A man ate live insects for three hours.

06:09.502 --> 06:12.563
They had to beg us to leave.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.832
You brush your teeth with your fingers,
don't you?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.379
First case, Your Honor.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.610
<i>- Peaple v. Anthony Raga.</i>
KEMP: Mm-hm.

06:26.853 --> 06:30.756
Mr. Rego, it says here
you assaulted a waiter with a pool cue.

06:30.924 --> 06:34.292
- Allegedly assaulted, Your Honor.
- Oh, no, I hit him, all right.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.826
The defense rests.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.088
You see, Your Honor...

06:37.264 --> 06:40.461
...he gave me a bowl of soup
with this giant dead fly in it.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.569
So I says to him,
“Hey, there's a fly in my soup.“

06:43.737 --> 06:46.035
And he says,
“So? Get him to split the check.“

06:46.206 --> 06:48.174
[LAUGHS]

06:50.977 --> 06:52.911
“Get him to split the check.“

06:56.049 --> 06:58.848
Give me a hand, will you?
I'm dying up here.

07:00.153 --> 07:04.215
Your Honor, at that point, the bartender
demanded payment, and a scuffle ensued.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.415
It was my last buck.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.118
This clown just cleaned me out
on a game of eight ball.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.632
- Clown?
- Well, not a real clown.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.857
It's just kind of a figure of speech.

07:15.335 --> 07:18.270
I feel like I'm talking to a duffel bag.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.164
Could you describe this clown, Mr. Rego?

07:22.342 --> 07:25.312
Yeah, kind of tall and skinny.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.004
Kind of were along black bathrobe.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.149
He ran the table on me four times.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.480
And then he shakes my hand
and zaps me with a joy buzzer.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.588
- That's Harry.
- What?

07:35.755 --> 07:38.247
- You said a black bathrobe?
- Yeah.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.151
- Could it have been a judge's robe?
- I don't know.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.389
Well, take a look, bozo.
A man's life may depend on it.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.095
Oh, Your Honor, I am so sorry.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.967
This is silk, isn't it?

07:55.108 --> 07:59.875
If I may say, this is the strangest court
I've ever presided over.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.239
Thank you.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.610
I find the defendant guilty as charged.
Fifty-dollar fine.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.721
- Don't hit me.
- Okay, then talk.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.586
- Was his name Harry?
- Who?

08:13.760 --> 08:16.695
- The geek who skunked you at eight ball.
- I don't know his name.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.558
- You saw him at a pool hall?
- Yeah.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.326
- I looked there.
- Well, I didn't even say which one.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.593
There must be at least--

08:22.769 --> 08:25.033
Nine hundred and sixty-two of them.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.536
Yeah, well.
he's in the one across the street.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.207
Nine hundred and sixty-three.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.384
Come on.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.923
Six in the comer.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.051
Five in the side.

08:51.698 --> 08:56.158
Eleven in the come!
off the cockroach stuck to the felt.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.403
- I brought you your messages, sir.
- Hey, how about a quick game, Mac?

09:03.576 --> 09:05.271
No, sir. I gotta go back to work.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.846
- We were hoping you'd come with us, Harry.
- Yeah.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.743
No, I can't. I gotta practice.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.384
I'm going back out on the road.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.178
Sir, I have some great news.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.651
The bullet only grazed
one of Joey's lungs.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.550
- That is great news.
- That didn't come out well, did it?

09:19.726 --> 09:20.989
No, it was you. I loved it.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.823
Listen, Harry, the point is
that little Tiny Tim is fine.

09:23.997 --> 09:27.331
- He came out of surgery this morning.
- I know. I was there.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.800
He woke up, he opened his eyes...

09:30.970 --> 09:32.028
...called me “pig.“

09:33.640 --> 09:36.974
Maybe he meant it affectionately.

09:37.143 --> 09:40.340
Sir, when are you gonna stop
whipping yourself about that kid?

09:40.513 --> 09:42.914
I'm not whipping myself.

09:43.550 --> 09:47.646
But there was a very nice couple in
the back mom who offered to do it for me.

09:48.354 --> 09:51.813
Harry, now, we can't stand here and watch
while you throw your career away.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.551
Why don't you watch from over there?
The view is better.

09:54.727 --> 09:59.187
- But, sir, we can't--
- Hey, guys, can you take a hint?

09:59.365 --> 10:00.833
I quit.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.334
I am no longer interested
in what goes on up there.

10:04.504 --> 10:08.873
I will not sit at that bench
and say what the books tell me to say...

10:09.042 --> 10:10.703
...night after night.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.903
If you think it's all
fair and equitable, fine.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.483
As far as I'm concerned, it sucks rocks.

10:18.651 --> 10:19.675
Case closed.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.045
You're just gonna play pool
for the rest of your life?

10:23.223 --> 10:25.453
Sure, hours are the same.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.322
And besides,
it's something I'm pretty sure I'm good at.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.759
Pardon me.

10:32.832 --> 10:38.999
Two ball off the seven,
double-bank into the far comer.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.746
Good luck with the new gig.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.393
CHRISTINE:
You coming, Dan?

11:05.565 --> 11:08.296
You guys go ahead.
I'll be up in a minute.

11:08.468 --> 11:12.098
Hey, guys. Now, I'm counting on you
to come down here and keep me up to date.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.708
You know, like.
when we get new presidents and stuff.

11:17.710 --> 11:21.169
- Great bunch of kids, huh?
DAN: Yeah, right.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.610
So...

11:24.784 --> 11:27.253
You're not a judge anymore.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.979
That's right.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.181
You twerp.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.688
I beg your pardon?

11:35.862 --> 11:37.887
You simp.

11:38.064 --> 11:44.436
You pathetic, whining, wheezing.
jackassed twig.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.767
I get the feeling
you're trying to tell me something, Dan.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.206
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

11:51.678 --> 11:53.669
- You?
- Yes.

11:53.846 --> 11:56.178
I just get you broken in
to where I can handle you.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.750
And now I gotta take my chances
with some new judge.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.283
Oh, I see your point.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.421
What are the chances
of getting somebody...

12:02.589 --> 12:05.752
...as naive and as ignorant
as you are again?

12:06.526 --> 12:10.190
- I don't know, what, 50-, 6040-1 maybe?
- Do you think I'm kidding around here?

12:10.363 --> 12:13.264
- Dan, I really--
- Why don't you shut your beanie little face?

12:15.101 --> 12:18.127
You had a couple of bad nights.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.671
Is that any reason to just quit?
Throw it all away?

12:21.808 --> 12:24.436
It wasn't a couple of bad nights, Dan.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.636
A kid got shot.

12:27.714 --> 12:31.878
Now, you tell me that if I go back,
that's not gonna happen again.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.588
It will happen again, eventually.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.584
We can only do
what the law will allow us to do.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.389
- That's it.
- That ain't good enough.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.431
I understand you wanna
change water into wine once in a while.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.160
Cure a few blind men here and there.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.632
Dan...

12:53.306 --> 12:55.331
...I can't go back.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.341
I can't do it.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.136
It's too hard.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.548
Maybe it is.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.415
I wouldn't know.

13:08.721 --> 13:12.624
Maybe all of those people you helped
when they needed it...

13:12.792 --> 13:15.989
...they'll make up for the few
that you couldn't.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.862
I'll give your respects to the downtrodden
and the oppressed.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.728
I'm sure they'll understand.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.336
You're not playing fair, Dan.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.865
You were good, Harry.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.075
Very good.

13:30.910 --> 13:34.813
You were impartial, you were fair.

13:35.648 --> 13:41.246
Patient, compassionate, understanding.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.089
And I admired you.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.962
That's really getting below the belt,
isn't it?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.666
Ciao, baby.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.516
<i>- He's</i> right, you know.
- What?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.881
- You were good.
- Mister--?

14:15.054 --> 14:16.920
- Ray.
- Yeah, Ray, this is not--

14:17.090 --> 14:18.524
Ray Muntz.

14:18.691 --> 14:22.491
I was in your courtroom
for sleeping in the park.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.723
Yeah, you were smiling and making jokes.

14:25.898 --> 14:30.460
You said that benches weren't good
for my posture.

14:30.636 --> 14:31.660
I remember.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.330
Well, you should, it was funny.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.737
Did I help you?

14:40.747 --> 14:42.408
No.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.650
You gave me a fine.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.322
But you also did something else
I'll never forget.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.951
You talked to me.

14:56.529 --> 15:00.625
Well, the other judges,
they just shove your file aside and move on.

15:00.800 --> 15:05.101
But you, you spent some time with me.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.100
And that felt nice.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.273
So I remember too...

15:11.744 --> 15:13.405
...Your Honor.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.740
I remember it like it was yesterday.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.684
It was yesterday, Mr. Muntz.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.049
Oh.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.827
Where does the time go?

15:58.558 --> 16:01.425
He's been like that an awfully long time.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.593
I'm not gonna disturb him.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.926
The last time I said something,
he nearly hit my head off.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.329
How long are we just gonna stand here?

16:11.037 --> 16:15.565
He does look awfully immobile,
doesn't he?

16:17.043 --> 16:19.171
Well, we gotta do something.

16:19.345 --> 16:22.542
- Excuse me, is there a doctor here?
- Yeah, I'm a doctor.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.342
Sir, could you help us?

16:24.517 --> 16:27.179
Sure. <i>He's</i> dead.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.550
I'd say he's been dead
a good five minutes.

16:34.260 --> 16:38.754
Amazing as it seems,
this happened to us once.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.965
Bob's uncle Teddy
came over for Christmas dinner one year...

16:44.136 --> 16:47.538
...and dropped his head
right into the stuffing.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.633
I never got to open my presents.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.872
You never had any presents, sweetheart.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.380
What about the marble when I was 7?

16:59.118 --> 17:01.815
We had to give that back to Grandma,
darling.

17:01.988 --> 17:05.446
She couldn't wear the eye patch forever.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.060
I guess we're gonna have to call
for another judge?

17:12.231 --> 17:13.790
Well, what about this one?

17:13.965 --> 17:16.731
Put him in the hall,
somebody will pick him up eventually.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.929
Why does this junk
always have to be dumped on me?

17:20.106 --> 17:23.565
Now, this could take hours.
And I get tickets to the Jets game tonight.

17:23.742 --> 17:28.078
- You get tickets?
- Yeah, a pair on the 50-yard line.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.978
I would kill for a single in the end zone.

17:34.153 --> 17:35.951
Our grief appears to be inconsolable.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.819
Oh, ain't no use in hanging around here.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.751
Wait a minute!

17:45.831 --> 17:49.563
Paragraph six, section 27 of the New York
City municipal code clearly states...

17:49.735 --> 17:53.330
...that no session of criminal or civil court
may be recessed or dismissed...

17:53.506 --> 17:56.874
...unless so ordered by the magistrate
presiding over said session.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.375
Bull...

18:05.284 --> 18:09.380
...the man is dead.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.589
Drive safely, everybody.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.960
Yeah, hi.

18:21.133 --> 18:25.001
Yeah, this is Mac Robinson
of Arraignment Court Two.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.765
It looks like we're gonna need
a replacement judge...

18:27.940 --> 18:31.308
...to replace our replacement judge.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.206
I know it's the third in 24 hours.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.547
You're kidding.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.945
We set a record.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.816
Hi, guys.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.923
Let me put you on hold for a sec.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.924
<i>How's</i> it going?

18:51.030 --> 18:53.055
I went home. I got washed up.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.000
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

18:58.771 --> 19:03.208
Well, it's nice
to see everything's the way I left it.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.835
Except, of course,
for the dead guy on my bench.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.574
That would be Judge Kemp.

19:09.949 --> 19:13.886
Yeah, well, he's got my gavel
and he won't let go of it.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.016
And I guess I'll be needing it.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.560
I said, I guess I'll be needing it.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.726
I've decided to come back to work.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.009
I'm real sorry I shouted at everybody.

19:38.177 --> 19:42.341
And I'm sorry I acted like a two-legged,
Iobotomized jackass.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.350
I think we could buy that one.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.918
Apology accepted.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.613
- Oh, welcome back, Harry.
- We're glad to have you back.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.588
Guys, I am sorry.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.327
I guess it is as simple
as taking the good with the bad.

19:56.495 --> 19:59.055
No matter how bad the bad gets.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.097
If you're sure you wanna be a judge...

20:01.434 --> 20:03.266
I am sure.

20:03.736 --> 20:07.195
At least I know I'm not the best pool player
in the world.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.502
You should see me
when I have my own cue.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.838
Come on, let's go and see
if we can retrieve his gavel.

20:16.949 --> 20:20.044
- Your Honor--
- Miss Sullivan.

20:32.198 --> 20:36.362
I've really come to appreciate
these little chats of ours.

20:37.503 --> 20:41.804
- Glad to have you back, sir.
- The feeling's mutual, Mr. Robinson.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.843
I'm real glad you guys were there.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.739
Especially him.

20:49.548 --> 20:50.777
Dan?

20:51.350 --> 20:55.014
That man is the reason I'm standing here.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.450
He made me want this job...

20:56.622 --> 21:00.616
...more than anything I've ever wanted
in my entire life.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.319
Dan Fielding?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.732
Would you excuse us, Mac?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.833
Yeah. Yes, sir.

21:09.001 --> 21:12.494
- I'll just go tidy up your room a little bit.
- All right.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.474
It's good to see you, Harry.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.346
I owe you big, counselor.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.053
It was an honor, sir.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.981
No, I mean it, Dan.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.957
From the bottom of my heart...

21:35.628 --> 21:37.653
...to the tip...

21:38.063 --> 21:41.328
...of my beanie little face.

21:48.874 --> 21:52.640
All I had to do
was tell him what I was gonna do.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.675
Hi.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.253
Cat still got your tongue?

22:05.424 --> 22:06.755
That happens to me sometimes.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.623
I just have so much to say,
I can't say anything, I guess.

22:09.795 --> 22:11.627
I know the feeling.

22:11.797 --> 22:15.233
You mind if I ask you
what it was you were gonna say?

22:15.868 --> 22:17.632
Welcome back.

22:18.204 --> 22:21.640
I can see why that would be tough
to put into words.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.910
You are very good up there.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.445
And big hearts are hard to find
these days.

22:29.448 --> 22:33.783
Well, I may be a pig,
but I'm a concerned pig.

22:35.654 --> 22:39.921
You know, sir, if you're gonna feel sorry
for every person that comes in here...

22:40.092 --> 22:42.959
-...you're not gonna last very long.
- Yeah.

22:43.562 --> 22:45.860
I am beginning to understand that.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.295
I haven't been up there
as long as you have...

22:48.467 --> 22:51.300
...but I have managed
to develop a detachment from my work...

22:51.470 --> 22:53.768
...and there's no reason
why you can't too.

22:53.939 --> 22:57.102
Ready any time you are, Miss Sullivan.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.241
Are you sure we ain't putting you out?

23:02.414 --> 23:05.748
