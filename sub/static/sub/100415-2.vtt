WEBVTT

00:12.722 --> 00:14.515
Wipe it down.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.565
Thanks.

00:23.566 --> 00:25.693
(can opens)

00:45.796 --> 00:47.173
Motherfucker.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.443
Think he'll do it?

01:07.485 --> 01:11.197
Considering Gary's history,
he might be wary.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.656
Two dead children

01:12.698 --> 01:15.785
caught in a drive-by?
Hope he'd do it.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.828
Me too.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.837
How's that going?

01:28.756 --> 01:31.634
Benny's offered to teach Jack
to write code this summer.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.555
You okay with that?

01:37.807 --> 01:39.266
Why wouldn't I be?

01:39.308 --> 01:40.851
Means some Saturdays

01:40.893 --> 01:42.353
it'll just be you and Joe.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.314
Sure that's not Joe's idea?

01:45.356 --> 01:46.607
(chuckles)

01:50.528 --> 01:52.321
So, what'd he say?

01:52.363 --> 01:54.073
He said yes.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.992
Sweet. Thanks, Dad.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.161
Those are my flippers.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.913
Used to be.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.624
I'll remember that.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.292
Want another beer, J?

02:07.086 --> 02:10.047
-Benny?
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.

02:10.089 --> 02:13.259
-J?
-No, I'm good.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.302
Benny.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.513
Jerry.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.558
How's work?

02:20.599 --> 02:22.017
Good. You?

02:22.017 --> 02:23.936
Busy.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.983
(indistinct radio chatter)

02:39.618 --> 02:41.620
(camera clicking)

02:48.669 --> 02:51.130
All yours.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.132
Incidental facial bruising.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.176
Possible bop
on the back of the head.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.515
Powder burns.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.142
Point-blank.
One and done.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.853
Something bigger than a .22.

03:05.895 --> 03:08.230
Brass?

03:08.272 --> 03:09.899
Not that we've found.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.984
Well, keep looking.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.778
-Shot here or somewhere else?
-Well, probably here.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.532
But I'll give you my best guess
when I can take a real look.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.744
Lividity, time of death.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.370
All that good stuff.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.372
Fair enough.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.416
Why don't you fish him out.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.590
Who are you?

03:34.632 --> 03:37.593
And what the fuck
are you doing down here?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.649
HENRY:
Bosch?

03:58.113 --> 03:59.490
What are you doing here?

03:59.531 --> 04:02.201
Just stopped by
to say hi to my daughter.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.161
What's your daughter doing here?

04:04.203 --> 04:07.039
College student volunteer.
You?

04:07.081 --> 04:08.457
Investigator.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.501
Conviction Integrity Unit.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.628
-That's right.
-Like it?

04:12.670 --> 04:14.171
Love it.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.799
Making sure justice is served.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.217
Noble.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.302
You think
we never make mistakes?

04:20.344 --> 04:22.596
On the contrary.
You're about to make one now.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.098
Something we can
help you with, Detective?

04:24.139 --> 04:26.350
-I don't know. Can you?
-Ed Sung.

04:26.392 --> 04:28.477
Harry Bosch.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.105
I need to talk to whoever's
working the Borders case.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.066
How do you know about that?

04:34.108 --> 04:37.152
Little birdie from RHD clued me.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.031
It's you.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.450
-We're looking into it, yes.
-Look, I don't know

04:43.492 --> 04:45.869
what new evidence you guys think
you have, but it's bullshit.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.163
Preston Borders
murdered Danielle Skyler.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.083
-Anything else is a scam.
-We have a deathbed confession.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.543
-From who?
-Another convict.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.044
A jailhouse confession?

04:54.086 --> 04:56.088
That's all it takes
for CIU to open a case?

04:56.130 --> 04:58.632
-Of course not.
-Detective, we have
your case report,

04:58.674 --> 05:02.261
your trial testimony.
All we need from you, really.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.888
Unless you'd like
to add something to the record.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.348
For the record,
it was a righteous conviction.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.142
Short of the needle,
he got what he deserved.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.309
Don't let this fucking guy go.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.853

Couple days before.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.323
EDGAR: Hmm. Hot about something.
Read lips?

06:46.365 --> 06:48.367
My español ain't that good.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.328
-Least you know it's Spanish.
-Warrant?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.747
-Right here.
-Let's go see
if Junior's come home yet.

06:55.707 --> 06:59.253
-Appreciate it, man. Take care.
-Great.

06:59.294 --> 07:02.422
-Scent trail stopped
in the garage, right?
-Right.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.217
So either the killer
rendezvoused with their driver,

07:05.259 --> 07:06.760
or they had
a second car stashed.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.221
Or boosted a getaway ride
or jacked someone.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.098
Lady reported
her husband missing.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.183
Dropped the dog at the groomer,
didn't come home.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.018
Block and a half
from the pharmacy.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.354
Ran the name,
got the plate from DMV.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.981
Put out a want on the vehicle.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.483
Got video canvassing going.
Nothing yet.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.402
What about his cell,
credit cards?

07:23.443 --> 07:26.363
-No activity.
-Doesn't bode well.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.782
On my way to talk to the wife.
Keep you posted.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.701

-How's your, uh...

07:40.252 --> 07:42.921
your unpaid, overworked
summer slave labor gig

07:42.963 --> 07:45.132
-going so far?
-I'm learning a lot.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.758
It's a really interesting place.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.387
Oh, yeah. This is where
the rubber meets the road.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.431
No fat cat corporate bullshit.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.433
Just real people's real lives.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.435
I get that.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.230
And a stint in the D.A.'s
on your CV? Can't hurt.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.734
You thinking about it
as a career? Criminal justice?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.611
-Maybe.
-Law school?

08:05.652 --> 08:08.197
-Law school, law enforcement...
-Ah.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.865
Follow in your father's
footsteps.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.575
I don't know.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.661
Maybe this is more where,
like you say, justice gets done.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.626
I asked my dad
about the Skyler case.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.922
Look, I...

08:24.963 --> 08:27.424
I can't really talk
about that with you.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.800
-I shouldn't have mentioned it.
-He said Preston Borders

08:28.842 --> 08:30.427
-is a psychopath.
-No doubt.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.471
He raped and murdered Danielle
Skyler without question.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.473
-Well, actually, there is...
-And there were more women, too,

08:34.514 --> 08:35.599
that he was never charged with.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.145
You ever hear the term
"testilying"?

08:40.187 --> 08:42.189
You're saying my dad's lying?

08:42.231 --> 08:43.565
No, I'm not saying that.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.567
I'm just saying...

08:45.609 --> 08:48.946
sometimes cops,
they manipulate evidence

08:48.987 --> 08:50.781
to make sure
they get a conviction

08:50.822 --> 08:52.491
on someone they think is guilty.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.159
They frame them.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.535
In a word.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.204
And that's what you think
my dad did?

08:57.246 --> 08:58.997
No, I'm not saying that, either.
We just...

08:59.039 --> 09:01.291
Look, we just want to make sure
we got the right guy.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.747
They opened a file.
It's an active investigation.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.668
State medical board.

Maybe what Junior and Pops
were arguing about.

Old man killing the golden goose
that lays the eggs.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.844
Eggs are golden, not the goose.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.763
I thought it was the goose.

I'll take your word for it.

WOMAN: The groomer called,
said they were closing.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.957
Was someone gonna come
pick up Lucy.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.001
That's when I started to worry.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.337
The last time
you heard from him?

11:10.379 --> 11:13.465
Yesterday morning
when he left to do errands.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.300
Uh, drop off the dog,

11:15.342 --> 11:18.095
go to the grocery store,
pick up the dry cleaning.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.097
-Honey-do list?
-Yeah.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.473
You try calling him?

11:21.515 --> 11:23.225
He left his cell phone at home.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.353
We were hoping to use his phone
to get a fix on his whereabouts.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.729
Me, too.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.315
He always forgets it,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.567
so I don't call him up

11:32.609 --> 11:34.694
and add another thing
for him to do.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.489
Smart man.
I should try that.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.784
(Lucy panting)

11:40.826 --> 11:42.786
Something's happened to him,

11:42.828 --> 11:44.996
hasn't it?

11:52.671 --> 11:54.714
EDGAR: I thought Borders
exhausted his appeals.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.425
Says he has new evidence.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.009
CIU's looking into it.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.469
How do you know?

11:59.511 --> 12:01.847
Maddie overheard some gossip
at the D.A.'s.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.099
Yeah, you know how that goes.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.059
Loose talk.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.936
She accessed the file.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.980
Jesus, Harry.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.982
How'd she get the D.R. number?

12:12.023 --> 12:13.942
I did not ask.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.486
Apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.822
Guess who I ran into yesterday
at CIU?

12:18.864 --> 12:21.658
-Christina Henry.
-(whistles, laughs)

12:21.700 --> 12:23.410
She still hate you?

12:23.452 --> 12:24.953
Question answers itself.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.330
Shouldn't she recuse herself

12:27.372 --> 12:29.332
seeing that you banged her?

12:29.374 --> 12:32.252
Not exactly how I'd put it,
but yeah.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.087
What's the new evidence?

12:34.129 --> 12:36.923
Deathbed confession,
another con.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.758
That's bogus. That it?

12:38.800 --> 12:41.386
There's something else,
they wouldn't say.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.054
What you gonna do about it?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.639
I'm thinking
about getting a lawyer.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.142
-Why?
-Borders goes free,

12:47.184 --> 12:49.686
every defense attorney worth
their salt's gonna be looking

12:49.728 --> 12:54.483
to overturn my convictions,
every last one.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.778
(footsteps approaching)

13:00.280 --> 13:03.366
-Lieutenant?
-Hey, come in. Sit down.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.578
How are you feeling?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.997
Oh, I've nicked myself worse
shaving.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.710
So... what the hell happened
the other day?

13:13.752 --> 13:17.589
We were responding code 3
to the 211 in progress.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.966
Yeah, I pulled
the incident history.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.135
All going according to Hoyle.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.471
Got to the intersection,
called clear.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.264
You're sure?

13:26.306 --> 13:32.562
Positive, but then I saw the
shamu coming on way too fast.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.273
I said,
"Wait, whoa, fuck, hold on,"

13:35.315 --> 13:37.400
something like that, then boom.

13:38.944 --> 13:41.446
Okay.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.823
I hear "clear," so I step on it.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.369
Next thing I know-- bang.
I'm T-boned, out of nowhere.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.788
Yeah, but Crate says
that he changed his mind

13:49.829 --> 13:51.665
when he saw
the patrol car coming.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.166
I'm looking straight ahead.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.834
He definitely called "clear."

13:54.876 --> 13:58.088
And then, he said
he said "wait"?

13:58.129 --> 13:59.965
It's too late.
I'm already committed.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.967
Yeah.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.802
You know, honestly, I...
(sighs)

14:03.843 --> 14:06.846
It's a gray area.
I-I'm not sure that anybody's

14:06.888 --> 14:08.557
at fault here.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.976
Well, I agree with you.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.894
Except for that fucking Powers,

14:12.936 --> 14:15.355
that lead-foot fuck. I...

14:17.190 --> 14:20.193
Okay. What's next?

14:20.235 --> 14:23.363
You're probably gonna get dinged
a day or two.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.407
Powers, too.

14:27.409 --> 14:31.246
Well, anything you can do
to help us out, Lieutenant.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.040
You always go to bat for us.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.084
Doesn't go unnoticed.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.800
(sighs heavily)

14:47.846 --> 14:49.848
(distant chatter)

14:55.270 --> 14:57.272
(Irving sighs)

14:58.481 --> 14:59.858
Did you know about this?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.443
First I've heard of it.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.738
I haven't even seen a 128.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.781
Should I be worried?

15:06.823 --> 15:08.366
Sir?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.535
It was a long time ago.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.621
You were a new D1.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.873
Anything you might have done,
or not done,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.499
you now wish
you'd done differently?

15:16.541 --> 15:19.419
I've made my share of mistakes,
but not on this case.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.796
This was done by the numbers
start to finish.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.007
The D.A. would say,
of course you'd say that.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.426
-You've got a lot to lose.
-I don't care about that.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.011
I'm concerned
about the victim's family.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.929
Justice was done.
I don't want to see it undone.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.977
You've got my back on this one,
right, Chief?

15:36.019 --> 15:38.104
100%.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.360
Good.

15:45.654 --> 15:48.406
(door closes)

15:48.448 --> 15:50.909
Her husband was in the area
at the time of the murder.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.744
He's missing, so is his car.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.288
Did you get Missing Persons to
put out a want of the vehicle?

15:55.330 --> 15:57.916
-This morning.
-Good work. Keep me posted.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.210
Hey L.T.,
when do I get a new partner?

16:00.251 --> 16:02.128
Oh, we got someone.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.172
A transfer from Wilshire. A D2.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.965
-Homicide?
-Robbery.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.717
That's awkward.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.886
-How so?
-Well, outranks me,

16:09.928 --> 16:11.513
but I got more experience
working murders.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.640
-Robbery isn't CAPs or Auto.
-Of course not.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.225
I'm sure she's a quick learner.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.602
You are just the one
to show her the ropes

16:17.644 --> 16:19.229
in a collegial
and cordial manner.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.106
Come on. A D1 training a D2?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.942
That's a feather in your cap,
Rondell.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.112
Oh, and, uh, Pierce?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.905
Now that
you've got a female partner?

16:28.947 --> 16:30.865
-Yes?
-Lose the fucking murse.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.666
Thank you. Keep the change.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.335
Yeah, I heard about it.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.797
Eight and ten, playing
in the church parking lot.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.841
Yeah, sucks.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.386
Gonna talk to them?

16:51.428 --> 16:54.180
Look, man, I ain't seen Jonas
since he got out.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.015
I don't know where he at.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.017
Just tell 'em what you do know.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.103
You vouch for these guys?

17:00.145 --> 17:02.564
Yeah, I do.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.150
They just want to talk to Jonas.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.861
Eight and ten, man.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.405
Eight and ten.

17:10.447 --> 17:12.657
(scoffs)
All right.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.701
Yeah, I'll talk to 'em.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.915
(laughs)

17:22.250 --> 17:25.003
Detective Ray Marcos.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.131
This used to be a black
neighborhood, remember?

17:28.173 --> 17:29.966
Now even the cops are Mexican.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.177
Yup. Things sure did change.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.429
(laughs)
Man.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.389
So, how are you doing?

17:36.431 --> 17:38.391
I get by.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.143
Working?

17:40.185 --> 17:43.897
Body shop. Bona fide
body and fender man now.

17:43.938 --> 17:46.107
-Not a chop shop, I hope.
-(laughing)

17:46.149 --> 17:49.360
Strictly legit, baby.
Strictly legit. I'm serious.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.529
Staying straight?

17:51.571 --> 17:54.365
-You know, define straight.
-Sober.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.242
A little weed, little wine.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.702
-Chipping?
-Nah, not at all, man.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.829
Don't need it. Don't do it.
Don't want it.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.416
Good. Good.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.629
How's your mama?

18:07.670 --> 18:09.255
Ah, she fine, man, you know,

18:09.297 --> 18:11.382
long as she keep her blood sugar
under control, you know?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.676
-She still in the same place?
-Ah, she ain't never leaving.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.762
-(laughs)
-Some things just don't change.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.972
-Thank God.
-Oh.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.266
Well, you send her my regards.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.769
I will. Same to your wife.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.355
Yeah, we split up
a long time ago now.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.233
Oh, man. My bad. I didn't know.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.528
We spoke about it, Gary...
at the time.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.239
Yeah, shit. I forgot.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.283
I'm sorry. Must have been
during my hazy period.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.327
Yeah, it was your hazy period.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.207
(sighs)

18:44.249 --> 18:46.000
All right,
I'm gonna talk to these guys.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.336
Thank you, brother.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.839
IRVING:
Why wasn't I notified?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.549
You were in charge
of the task force.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.259
-All the more reason.
-I wanted to see

18:54.300 --> 18:55.677
if there was something to it

18:55.718 --> 18:57.053
before I brought it
to your attention.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.347
And is there?
Something to it?

18:59.389 --> 19:00.932
Possible new DNA,

19:00.974 --> 19:03.977
which could corroborate
or exclude the confession.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.229
And if it corroborates it?

19:06.271 --> 19:08.147
Then this office will support
Borders' petition

19:08.189 --> 19:09.816
for a habeas hearing.

19:12.694 --> 19:16.197
Borders committed that murder,
I have no doubt.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.033
Let's see what the DNA tells us,
and we'll go from there.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.871
Oh.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.128
You looked at it?

19:30.169 --> 19:34.132
I can see why the officers
reacted the way they did, and...

19:34.173 --> 19:37.427
I also understand
the community outcry.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.596
And?

19:40.638 --> 19:42.932
I'm still mulling my decision.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.977
I'll let you know.

19:54.652 --> 19:57.447
I-I think we can agree that both
parties were to blame.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.825
Oh. I think we know where the
lion's share of that shit goes.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.328
Oh, come on, Don.
Your guys were cowboying it.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.748
You need to get those geezers
off the street, Grace.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.374
You're lucky
they didn't hit a civilian.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.501
They're getting a little long
in the fucking tooth

20:10.543 --> 20:13.087
to still be in the field.
High time they retired.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.344
(brakes squeaking)

20:32.106 --> 20:34.067
(brakes squeak)

20:56.172 --> 20:58.341
Chop Shop Riviera down here.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.843
Picked this baby clean
in five minutes flat.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.096
Looking at whoever stripped this
for your 187?

21:03.137 --> 21:08.184
Mm-mm. Killers wiped this down
and walked away.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.478
-Traces of blood in the trunk.
-Vic had a scalp wound.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.064
-Pistol whipped.
-He the owner?

21:13.106 --> 21:16.734
That's my guess. I'll have
a positive I.D. by morning.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.487
-Call for a flatbed, will you?
-Yeah.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.742
13-William-37,
can I get an OPG tow

21:24.784 --> 21:28.246
to 212 Center Street for a gold
Buick Century, no plates?

21:34.711 --> 21:36.838
(footsteps approaching)

21:37.880 --> 21:40.049
You're still here?

21:40.091 --> 21:42.677
I was just leaving.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.679
First in, last out.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.931
You want to be known
as the office grind?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.766
Why not?
What's wrong with that?

21:48.808 --> 21:51.185
Look, it's happy hour.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.272
Bunch of us are going over
to the Westbound.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.690
I don't think so.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.650
Hey, come on,
let me buy you one.

21:57.692 --> 22:01.154
Apologize for throwing shade
on your dad.

22:01.195 --> 22:03.281
(sighs)

22:03.322 --> 22:04.741
I've got things to do.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.285
All work and no play?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.328
Really?

22:13.875 --> 22:16.461
(mellow jazz playing)

22:20.131 --> 22:21.799
(phone rings)

22:24.177 --> 22:25.386
Chief?

22:25.428 --> 22:27.346
I met with Hines.

22:27.388 --> 22:30.808
She's reopening the case,
pending the DNA results.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.311
-What DNA?
-From the scene.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.313
Something that
wasn't tested at the time.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.357
-What would that be?
-She didn't say.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.485
But if the DNA matches Olmer...

22:40.526 --> 22:42.320
He the convict?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.697
Yeah, the deathbed confession.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.699
If it puts him at the scene...

22:46.741 --> 22:49.660
If it puts him at the scene,
it's phony-- he was never there.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.496
Borders acted alone.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.331
Agreed. Look...

22:53.372 --> 22:55.708
if the DNA's not Olmer's,
then this is all moot.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.585
And if it is, we'll fight it.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.754
It won't go unchallenged.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.589
Okay, thanks, Chief.

23:01.631 --> 23:03.466
You're welcome.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.762
-(sighs heavily)
-Hey, how'd your meeting go?

23:09.013 --> 23:11.265
She still hasn't decided.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.434
-That's frustrating.
-Yeah.

23:13.476 --> 23:17.021
But I understand
the politics of her position.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.399
I mean, she's in a jam,
hemmed in from all sides.

23:20.441 --> 23:23.152
We're all trying to navigate
this new reality.

23:23.194 --> 23:27.198
Do you think you could navigate
your way to bed?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.619
I'll be in in a minute.

23:33.287 --> 23:34.956
Okay.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.969

Fly-fishing?

Famous potatoes?

24:14.996 --> 24:16.956
It's on the license plates.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.291
Worth the risk?

24:18.332 --> 24:20.251
You could get us both in Dutch.

Dutch? You sound like my dad.

Don't you ever get tired of
being so careful all the time?

24:26.632 --> 24:27.967
I do.

24:28.009 --> 24:31.012
Your dad know about that?

24:31.053 --> 24:32.513
No.

24:32.555 --> 24:34.390
What would he say?

24:34.432 --> 24:36.434
He'd tell me to be careful.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.477
Well, he probably had one
when he was your age.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.605
When he was my age,
he was in the Army.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.940
-Oh.
-In combat.

24:51.365 --> 24:54.035
Yes, I do.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.037
Get tired of...

24:56.078 --> 24:58.164
being too careful.

25:08.925 --> 25:09.926

25:09.967 --> 25:11.010
Hey.

25:11.052 --> 25:13.471
Hey. Midnight oil?

25:13.512 --> 25:15.473
Ah, I'm just catching up.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.475
Can I get you anything
before I go?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.852
Coffee? Tea? Pizza?

25:19.894 --> 25:21.812
No, I'm fine.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.648
You're here late.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.983
Yeah. Howard called in sick.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.818
-Mm.
-I pulled a double.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.112
Go home. You must be beat.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.906
I will. Thanks.

25:31.948 --> 25:34.659
Oh. Uh, how's Lisa?

25:34.700 --> 25:36.202
Time of her life.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.663
Got a postcard from her

39:15.562 --> 39:17.522
(siren wailing in distance)

39:17.564 --> 39:19.983
(knocking)

39:23.528 --> 39:25.197
Jose?

39:25.238 --> 39:27.115
-Cuz. (sniffles)
-Man, where have you been

39:27.157 --> 39:28.533
the last few days?
I been calling.

39:28.575 --> 39:29.826
Been laying low, man.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.495
Just here and there
with this girl I know.

39:32.746 --> 39:34.289
Sorry about your dad.

39:34.331 --> 39:36.708
Yeah.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.335
Can I come in?

39:38.376 --> 39:41.379
Sure, sure. Of course.
S-Sorry.

39:45.342 --> 39:48.470
These people, you can't just...
talk to them?

39:48.512 --> 39:50.555
They're not the kind of people
you can just talk to, cuz.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.140
Obviously.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.350
Who are they?

39:53.391 --> 39:55.602
Gangsters.

39:55.644 --> 39:57.104
Gringos.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.105
Russian?

39:58.146 --> 39:59.356
Don't sound Russian.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.607
American.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.651
Anglos.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.365
What do you need, cuz?

40:08.406 --> 40:11.701
I need to disappear for a while.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.871
My sister married
that Basque guy.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.540
The sheepherder?

40:16.581 --> 40:18.041
Maybe you could stay with them.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.459
Where do they live?

40:19.501 --> 40:21.753
-Outside of Bakersfield.
-Bakersfield. Geez.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.797
How-how am I gonna get
all the way out there?

40:23.839 --> 40:25.298
Bus.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.300
You can't drive me?

40:27.342 --> 40:28.969
Can't.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.971
Wish I could, cuz.

40:31.012 --> 40:32.430
Let me use your car.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.308
For how long?

40:36.351 --> 40:37.602
I don't know.

40:37.644 --> 40:40.772
(sighs)
Let me think about it.

40:40.814 --> 40:42.774
It's just, I don't-- I don't
really know Rosie that well,

40:42.816 --> 40:44.734
-you know, so I...
-I'll call 'em in the morning,

40:44.776 --> 40:46.903
smooth the way.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.281
Thanks.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.872
Loan me some cash?

40:58.081 --> 41:00.292
Yeah, sure. No problem.

41:09.759 --> 41:12.095
(sniffles)

41:15.932 --> 41:18.018
I could use a gun, too.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.149
(phone ringing)

41:28.028 --> 41:29.821
Chandler.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.031
The DNA's a match.

41:31.072 --> 41:32.449
It's Olmer's.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.491
Bullshit.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.493
DNA don't lie, my friend.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.662
Convicts and lawyers do.

41:37.704 --> 41:40.081
You're preaching to the choir.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.833
What was the source?

41:41.875 --> 41:44.920
Um, a handkerchief
found at the scene.

41:44.961 --> 41:47.339
Olmer was nowhere near
that murder.

41:47.380 --> 41:50.133
Preston Borders killed
Danielle Skyler by himself.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.510
-Nobody else.
-Well, brace yourself.

41:52.552 --> 41:55.388
The D.A. will schedule a habeas
hearing before the week's out.

41:57.474 --> 42:00.018
Okay. Thanks for the heads-up.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.019
My pleasure.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.437
Have a good evening.

42:02.479 --> 42:04.481
You do the same.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.736
That about the Borders case?

42:09.778 --> 42:11.488
Yeah.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.907
D.A. thinks
she's got new evidence.

42:13.949 --> 42:16.159
Enough for a hearing.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.037
Is there new evidence?

42:19.079 --> 42:20.205
It's bogus.

42:20.247 --> 42:22.207
Can you prove that?

42:22.249 --> 42:24.251
Gonna try.

42:26.253 --> 42:27.963
And if you can't?

42:29.589 --> 42:32.884
Borders conviction
will get kicked.

42:32.926 --> 42:34.594
And he will walk.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.055
I hope that doesn't happen.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.058
Me, too.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.520
Good night.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.188
Good night, honey.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.815
Hey, Mads.

42:48.525 --> 42:51.486
Only no talking about this
at the office with anyone, yeah?

42:51.528 --> 42:52.862
'Course not.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.740
Everything okay at work?

42:55.782 --> 42:58.159
Yeah. Great.

42:58.201 --> 43:01.413
I hope you know you can talk
to me about anything, Mads.

43:02.455 --> 43:04.457
I know.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.751
Night.
