00:01.602 --> 00:05.305
My name is Lena Grisky
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:05.338 --> 00:06.540
I have a secret.

00:06.573 --> 00:08.474
I'm a time traveler from 1905

00:08.509 --> 00:11.244
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.751

(Lena) Previously...

00:48.181 --> 00:50.416
(Ines) <i>Lena's in so much trouble</i>
<i>with Ms Carré for running out</i>
<i>in the middle of the showcase.</i>

00:50.450 --> 00:53.086
(Ms Carré) You may stay,
but you'll never make Company.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.121
(Ines) The Time Collectors
still have her timepiece.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.223
This timepiece
can create a time loop.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.692
Ouch.
Clive!

00:58.725 --> 01:00.426
There's another piece somewhere.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.428
(Ines) I wonder
if I'll ever see Pinky again.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.631
Be right there, boss.
(Ines) What? He was cute.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.534
If beauty were time
you'd be eternity!

01:18.612 --> 01:20.747
Has anyone seen Lena?

01:21.815 --> 01:25.185
(Lena) She's not here.
Oh. Okay.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.888
Lena... Come on, what happened
to proving Carré wrong?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.390
What about
the big speech you made?

01:30.423 --> 01:32.859
What if she's right?
What if I'm not good enough?

01:32.893 --> 01:36.429
Well, she will be if you
just lie here feeling sorry
for yourself all day.

01:36.462 --> 01:39.833
We've got a history test to
crush
and a full day of dances
with Carré.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.868
Lena, come on! Lena!

01:43.236 --> 01:44.671
I'll pass.

01:46.072 --> 01:50.443
Okay. I'll tell Carré you'll be
dancing from your bed then,
yeah?

01:50.476 --> 01:55.916
(laughs) Lena. Come on.
The only way to change her mind

01:55.949 --> 01:59.119
is to actually change her mind.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.388
Oh! You know what?

02:03.590 --> 02:05.358
You're right.

02:05.391 --> 02:06.593
Thanks, Ines!

02:10.263 --> 02:11.364
(Ines chuckles)

02:14.367 --> 02:17.237
Today, you'll put together
a short piece,

02:17.270 --> 02:21.508
drawing inspiration
from a different time period.

02:21.542 --> 02:25.779
This is so perfect. This is
my chance to change her mind.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.582
(Ms Carré) Blending
two time periods, two styles

02:28.615 --> 02:31.552
will make
for some interesting dances.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.386
You have until end of day.

02:33.419 --> 02:40.193
First group: Dash and Max,
Thea, Ines and Jeff.

02:40.226 --> 02:47.300
Second group: Tim, Laura,
Sana, Mike and Jonas.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.775
Ms Carré?
Which group shall I join?

02:54.808 --> 02:57.443
Neither.
You won't be participating.

02:57.477 --> 03:00.981
You're free to work by yourself
in another studio.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.549
Yes, Ms Carré.

03:03.449 --> 03:09.255
(other students whispering)

03:09.289 --> 03:13.226
(magical tinkling
and suspenseful music)

03:21.902 --> 03:25.939
I can't believe you went
to the Time Collectors.
Of all the stupid things...

03:25.972 --> 03:29.676
But, just for the record,
I did come to you first.

03:29.710 --> 03:33.246
Do you not remember
the whole threat to send me
to Uncle Alain's farm?

03:33.279 --> 03:34.981
Which I should have done.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.952
But let me assure you, you are
finished hurling yourself
through time. Is that clear?

03:42.322 --> 03:44.858
(bombastic classical music
plays)

03:57.671 --> 04:04.911
(panting, out of breath)

04:33.473 --> 04:37.778
(Henri) So my Dad's really mad,
and now he won't tell me
anything else.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.713
I just wish we could talk.

04:51.858 --> 04:55.562
(magical tinkling noise)

04:59.399 --> 05:03.604
♪ Cause time passes so slowly ♪

05:05.405 --> 05:06.072
(gasps)

05:07.440 --> 05:11.878
♪ With your arms
around my body ♪

05:11.912 --> 05:14.380
(Lena) Henri! I'm here.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.516
Are you here?

05:15.549 --> 05:19.853
<i>I mean there... but here.</i>
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

05:19.886 --> 05:21.755
Oh, I wish we could talk too.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.957
I have so much to tell you.

05:29.462 --> 05:32.999
(magical tinkling noise)

05:33.033 --> 05:34.535
(gasps)

05:35.736 --> 05:37.037
Whoa.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.973
She's here now!

05:41.508 --> 05:44.945
(gasps in disbelief) We've
never been on the roof
at the same time before.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.382
The letter appeared right away!
Are you there right now?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.955
(magical tinkling noise)

05:58.091 --> 06:00.827
(magical tinkling noise)
(gasps)

06:03.129 --> 06:07.901
(Lena) Henri! I am here right
now! This is totally wicked.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.904
'Wicked'? Is there evil?

06:10.937 --> 06:14.841
And why all these happy faces?
Is it a code?
(Lena laughs)

06:14.875 --> 06:18.779
Not that kind of wicked, silly.
Good wicked.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.482
The happy faces mean
I miss you like crazy.

06:23.550 --> 06:27.053
(Henri) I'll find a way
back to you. I promise.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.622
I hope so.

06:28.655 --> 06:31.825
I got in so much trouble
the other night for leaving.

06:31.858 --> 06:34.060
I almost got expelled
from school.

06:35.028 --> 06:39.800
Thankfully, they're letting
me stay, but Ms Carré said...

06:39.833 --> 06:42.536
she said that
I'll never make Company.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.115
(Clive) Oh.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.685
Where's Pinky?

07:00.887 --> 07:05.058
I... I think it's pretty obvious
he's not here, Frank.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.793
Thank you, Clive.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.530
My eyeballs actually stopped
working for a minute.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.898
So I'm really glad you could
fill in that blank for me.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.199
No problem, boss.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.035
I'd have that eye thing
checked out though.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.170
Don't talk.
For the rest of the day.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.606
Just sshh.
Okay...

07:20.073 --> 07:23.510
(walks down the stairs)
That seems a bit harsh.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.762
Hello, beautiful.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.497
Care for a walk?

07:45.131 --> 07:49.102
Or better yet, care for a bite?

07:54.307 --> 08:00.480
(sighs) You have the most
beautiful eyes I have ever seen.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.250
(sighs dreamily)

08:06.286 --> 08:08.254
(video game sounds)

08:08.288 --> 08:10.023
(incoming text message)

08:10.924 --> 08:12.659
Oh, gross.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.960
What?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.562
(incoming text message)

08:17.097 --> 08:20.100
In your dreams... As if I'd ever
go on a date with him!

08:20.133 --> 08:21.502
A date?

08:22.569 --> 08:25.238
A date with who?
Dirk.

08:25.271 --> 08:26.673
Dirk?

08:27.173 --> 08:29.209
He's sending you texts?

08:29.242 --> 08:31.912
(scoffs)

08:31.945 --> 08:33.847
I don't think so.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.695
I really miss you.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.166
I wish you could see all this.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.835
I wish you were home.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.572
I can almost feel you.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.807
Like you were right here.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.977
(giggles)
We're like Romeo and Juliet.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.683
Remember when we used to dress
up in those old costumes?

09:09.716 --> 09:13.186
Remember when we used to dress
up in those old costumes?

09:14.254 --> 09:16.690
You've just given me
the best idea!

09:16.723 --> 09:19.860
I have to take care
of something, but I'll be back!

09:19.893 --> 09:20.927
And thank you!

09:23.864 --> 09:26.232
(magical tinkling noise)

09:40.714 --> 09:42.816
(students chattering)

09:42.849 --> 09:44.284
Oh, hey, Dirk.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.386
What do you think you're doing?

09:46.419 --> 09:49.990
What?
Oh, don't play dumb with me.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.224
Go.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.831
Don't... text... Ines.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.967
Don't text her,
don't think about her

10:01.001 --> 10:04.137
and don't ask her on a date.
Got it?

10:04.170 --> 10:05.639
(exclaims)

10:35.702 --> 10:37.904
What are you doing here?
You can't be here!

10:37.938 --> 10:40.173
It's like magic.
Because... I am.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.811
Well, you can't be.
And yet I am.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.647
Do you have a bandage?
A what?

10:47.013 --> 10:49.049
Because I just scraped my knee
falling for you.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.017
Oh no. No, no, no, no.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.687
So you've been getting my texts?

10:53.720 --> 10:54.655
That was you!

10:54.688 --> 10:57.057
That makes more sense.
It's a loaner.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.259
What do you want?

10:59.793 --> 11:00.694
A date.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.462
No way.
Way.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.731
Not a chance.
I'm going to be late for class.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.702
So I'll meet you after school.
I'm going to class.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.407
Great. Super.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.743
So I'll see you after school?

11:17.310 --> 11:19.079
(laughs)

11:30.791 --> 11:33.126
(door opens, footsteps approach)

11:33.827 --> 11:36.396
How did you get in here?
What do you want?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.464
The other timepiece.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.968
(hesitant) Right, Frank?

11:42.002 --> 11:46.740
Well, I was hoping to be cooler
about it... but yeah.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.409
So, hand it over.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.377
What other timepiece?

11:51.878 --> 11:54.214
Good question, Victor.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.751
I'll tell you what.
What?

11:57.784 --> 11:59.452
Not you. Him.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.755
Hm-hm.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.491
I'll tell you what...
What?

12:07.994 --> 12:09.362
Clive.
Hm-hm.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.333
Stop turning my threats
into comedy routines, please?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.268
You got it, boss.
Thank you.

12:15.536 --> 12:18.038
I know you have
the other timepiece.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.174
So you can do like any sane
person would and hand it over.

12:21.207 --> 12:22.876
Or you can await
the consequences.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.212
I'm just giving you the
opportunity not to have to find
out what I will do next, Victor.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.815
Ooh... Whoa.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.784
I'd take that if I were you.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.855
You boys have no idea
who you are playing with.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.357
Don't test me.

12:43.129 --> 12:44.565
No, come on!

12:44.598 --> 12:48.368
We've done that a thousand
times. Can we please try
something different?

12:48.401 --> 12:50.837
It is different. You're just
not seeing my vision.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.940
So, Dirk won't be bothering
you again.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.843
Dash What did you do?
It's cool.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.445
(Jeff makes whooshing noises)
Jeff, back me up.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.248
We need to pick a time period.
The fifties are awesome.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.150
They're totally innovative.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.019
Oh yeah,
and you know that because...?

13:06.052 --> 13:09.422
(sighs) Guys, come on,
we haven't even agreed
on a concept yet.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.957
I'm going to refuel.

13:12.158 --> 13:15.596
(Lena) Guys! I have an idea.
And I think it's a good one.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.397
It's the kind
that gets you all tingly.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.966
Oh, please. I need tingles.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.538
Because all we have right now is
"Sir I'm Always Right"
and "Miss No I Am."

13:24.571 --> 13:27.173
(all chuckle)

13:27.207 --> 13:29.510
(Lena) Okay. We're a team

13:29.543 --> 13:30.944
and teams stick together.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.180
When we run the field,
we have to be proud and strong.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.918
Everyone put a hand in.
Uh... did you get that from TV?

13:38.418 --> 13:40.954
I did.
It was a very exciting speech.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.825
The boy went on to catch an
American football and everyone
lifted him up and carried him.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.126
Who's in?

13:47.961 --> 13:51.197
I don't want to point out the
obvious, but didn't Ms Carré
ban you from this assignment?

13:51.231 --> 13:53.934
Well, I feel like
it's an opportunity
to gain some ground with her.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.304
It's the tingly thing.
I have to follow it.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.141
I'm in. I love that movie.
(laughs)

14:01.174 --> 14:03.076
(laughs) I'm in, too.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.845
Out.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.448
You guys go ahead.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.084
Me and Thea are going to do
our own thing.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.291
Undecided.

14:18.324 --> 14:20.594
I promise you,
it's going to be outlandish.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.463
Really?
(Ines chuckles)

14:23.496 --> 14:26.132
No... wrong word.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.467
Out of this world?

14:27.500 --> 14:27.901
(all laugh)

14:27.934 --> 14:31.337
(Jeff) Better.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.206
Ah! There he is!
Team Lena.

14:33.640 --> 14:38.111
(Ines) Team Lena! Team Lena!
(Jeff cheers)

14:52.092 --> 14:53.459
(laughs)

15:05.138 --> 15:08.374
(giggles)

15:08.408 --> 15:12.312
Milady, may I request a dance?

15:12.345 --> 15:14.715
My dance card is filled
I'm afraid.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.984
Curious. May I see it?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.393
(laughs)

15:27.427 --> 15:30.597
(coughs)

15:30.631 --> 15:32.566
It looks rather empty now.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.036
(Lena laughs)

15:36.069 --> 15:39.339
I'm afraid if I bow any lower,
I might split my trousers.

15:39.372 --> 15:43.176
You'd be the talk of the town.
(laughs)

15:43.209 --> 15:46.446
(classical music plays)

15:46.479 --> 15:50.584
(both laugh)

15:51.518 --> 15:53.486
(Lena squeals)
(Henri laughs)

15:56.790 --> 15:58.559
(Lena gasps)

16:06.132 --> 16:08.034
(reads) "I was hoping
you'd find these...

16:08.068 --> 16:10.036
Thought they could help
with your project.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.672
I believe in you! Love, Henri."

16:11.705 --> 16:14.207
(gasps) You're the best, Henri!

16:30.390 --> 16:32.258
I knew you'd meet me.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.362
Can I ask you a question?

16:37.831 --> 16:40.266
Are you a camera?
No... not again.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.570
Because every time I see you,
I can't help but smile.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.507
Don't try to distract me
with your clever wit.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.408
You've got something
that belongs to Lena.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.778
Now give it to me.
And stop smiling.

16:51.812 --> 16:54.247
You're dodgy.
You're adorable.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.118
Your descriptive words
and well-rehearsed one-liners
don't move me.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.419
At all.

16:59.452 --> 17:03.724
Reeaally?
Cause you're smiling ear-to-ear.

17:03.757 --> 17:06.693
Give me the timepiece.
(sighs)

17:08.829 --> 17:10.430
Aah.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.533
Just kidding. I don't have it.

17:12.566 --> 17:16.069
It's back in 1905
with the boss.
Now come on...

17:16.102 --> 17:19.673
Let me take you on one date.
And I promise
you won't regret it...

17:20.306 --> 17:22.075
Okay...

17:22.108 --> 17:24.110
If you give me the timepiece

17:24.144 --> 17:29.249
and promise to leave
my best friend alone,
then I'll consider it.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.318
I knew it! You're as crazy
about me as I am about you.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.155
This feels like destiny,
doesn't it?

17:35.188 --> 17:37.758
Chill. I said I'd consider it.

17:38.759 --> 17:43.329
I can't make you any promises
other than I promise to worship
the ground you walk on

17:43.363 --> 17:45.766
until the end of time!

17:54.407 --> 17:55.776
Whoa.

17:55.809 --> 18:00.313
Why are you so smiley?
Oh, is it because of Dash?

18:00.346 --> 18:02.382
Nothing. And no.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.850
What's in the bag?

18:03.884 --> 18:05.118
You'll see.

18:06.052 --> 18:06.987
There's something
you're not telling me.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.322
(nervously)
Nothing to tell. Zero things.

18:09.355 --> 18:12.225
Absolutely nothing, honestly.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.273
(Frank) I will ransack
this entire place until I find
what I'm looking for.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.711
You will do nothing of the sort.
Now get out of here.
Okay.

18:30.744 --> 18:34.915
I'm warning you.
What do you think someone like
you can do to someone like me?

18:34.948 --> 18:36.449
Out.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.491
(tinkling noise)

18:51.264 --> 18:52.265
(Frank) I warned him.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.201
Why does he keep doing
the same thing over and over?

18:55.235 --> 18:57.370
He's in a time loop, Clive.
Ah!

18:57.403 --> 18:59.039
Why is he disappearing?

18:59.072 --> 19:01.407
When you're stuck in a time
loop,
you live the same moment
over and over again,

19:01.441 --> 19:03.176
and eventually you disappear.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.646
Just imagine what we can do
with both the timepieces.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.881
(Clive) He's going to get
so sick of apples.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.483
My apologies, Mr Victor, sir.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.588
It's too bad you weren't eating
something fun like a chocolate
mousse or an éclair!

19:14.621 --> 19:18.625
Come on... We need to find
that other timepiece.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.764
(Clive) Ooooh.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.269
Well, hello, handsome.

19:31.605 --> 19:32.739
Oh!

19:33.473 --> 19:35.208
Frank?

19:35.241 --> 19:36.442
(Frank) Yeees?

19:36.476 --> 19:37.611
I found a broom.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.514
What?
A broom.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.353
(Frank chuckles)

20:10.511 --> 20:14.681
(medieval music plays)

21:15.676 --> 21:18.845
Weren't you supposed to be
working on technique today,
Lena?

21:18.879 --> 21:20.614
Alone?

21:21.481 --> 21:22.816
Yes, Ms Carré.

21:23.584 --> 21:24.985
Then please sit down.

21:25.018 --> 21:28.421
And don't ever disobey
my orders again.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.091
I wanted to show you
that I do have what it takes.

21:31.124 --> 21:34.695
That I have drive,
and ideas, and passion.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.362
And costumes.
And costumes!

21:36.396 --> 21:39.099
I never asked for costumes.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.301
Well, I thought it would give it
that extra touch.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.539
My office. Now.

21:51.812 --> 21:53.046
(Max) Pssst.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.716
That was something, chica.

21:55.749 --> 21:59.720
I don't know what's gonna
happen, but it was something.

22:03.690 --> 22:07.060
(Clive laughs)
(rustling paper)

22:13.066 --> 22:14.868
There's got to be something.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.374
Hey! Victor Duquet
is a man of many secrets.

22:21.407 --> 22:24.144
That means keep looking
until you find something.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.679
(Clive sighs)

22:26.813 --> 22:28.549
More letters.

22:28.582 --> 22:30.984
Boring. Boring. Boring.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.687
Boring.

22:33.720 --> 22:34.921
Ooh!

22:36.557 --> 22:38.491
This one's about
some stupid jewelry.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.628
Who cares about
a stupid necklace anyway?

22:46.933 --> 22:48.535
"We will not see
each other again.

22:48.569 --> 22:53.840
I will protect my half
of the stone with my life
as I'm sure you will yours...

22:53.874 --> 22:56.977
and the two halves
will never be whole again.

22:57.010 --> 22:58.645
Alex."

22:58.679 --> 23:00.180
Clive!
Hm?

23:00.213 --> 23:03.016
This is about the timepiece!
Oh.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.019
Isn't that
what we're looking for?
Yes, Clive! Obviously.

23:07.453 --> 23:10.557
So, I guess I saved
the day then, didn't I?

23:11.925 --> 23:14.828
By tossing the letter away?

23:14.861 --> 23:19.966
Yeah, Clive, you are the single
greatest hero I've ever met
in my living life.

23:20.000 --> 23:20.967
Thank you, boss.

23:23.236 --> 23:27.173
Now all we have to figure out is
who this Alex guy is...

23:39.653 --> 23:41.454
What was that?

23:45.892 --> 23:50.230
I know I wasn't supposed to do
the assignment but I was just
so inspired, I had to.

23:50.263 --> 23:55.001
It was wrong but do you ever
feel
that if you don't dance what
you're feeling, you'll explode?

23:56.169 --> 24:01.908
I'm not one for explosions,
but I do understand, yes.

24:03.076 --> 24:08.081
I didn't mean to go against you,
but I wanted you to see
just how much this means to me.

24:08.114 --> 24:11.818
And that I do have
what it takes, Ms Carré.

24:11.852 --> 24:13.820
Even if you can't see that.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.523
It was beautiful.

24:16.557 --> 24:18.692
Inspired, in fact.

24:19.225 --> 24:22.162
Oh... Thank you.

24:22.796 --> 24:26.232
You didn't like being told you
weren't good enough, did you?

24:27.768 --> 24:28.969
No, Ma'am.

24:29.002 --> 24:33.740
Or being left out
of the assignment.
(softly) No.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.511
Well, good. My plan worked.

24:40.013 --> 24:41.515
This was a test...?

24:42.215 --> 24:44.851
Make no mistakes, Miss Grisky.

24:45.218 --> 24:49.790
If ever you defy me again,
you'll be expelled.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.694
Yes, Ms Carré.

24:53.727 --> 24:56.196
I mean, no, Ms Carré.

24:56.229 --> 24:59.032
I mean, you know what I mean,
Ms Carré.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.034
I do. You're dismissed.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.180
(Lena giggles)

25:17.951 --> 25:20.621
(Lena)
Henri, it worked. Thank you!

25:20.654 --> 25:23.857
Today was a good day.
Today was an excellent day.

25:23.890 --> 25:27.528
I'll tell you all about it but
first meet me on the peak.

25:30.363 --> 25:34.167
Now turn around, pretend
I'm right there beside you.

25:42.843 --> 25:45.646
Milady, may I have this dance?

25:45.679 --> 25:47.848
Yes. It would be
my pleasure, sir.
