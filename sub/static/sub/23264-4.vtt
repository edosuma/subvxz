He's got a light! Oi!

16:52.420 --> 16:54.180
No! No, no, no, don't do that!

16:54.180 --> 16:57.860
Don't do that. Don't do that! I said
don't do that!

17:10.980 --> 17:12.140
- Come on out.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.859
Help him out.

18:07.780 --> 18:10.100
- What's going on? Hey, what are
this lot doing here?

18:10.100 --> 18:12.420
- The case has been passed up to
Counter Terrorism.

18:12.420 --> 18:15.540
- What?!
- You'll give them access to all the
evidence collected so far,

18:15.540 --> 18:18.260
and continue working in a support
role.

18:18.260 --> 18:21.100
- Oh, come on. Look, he's just
getting started. You know that!

18:21.100 --> 18:23.580
Look, he's not a name on a Counter
Terrorism database.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.820
He's a murderer.

18:24.820 --> 18:27.620
Look, they'll just keep blundering
after him until they get lucky.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.380
All right, how many people does he
kill between now and then? Huh?

18:30.380 --> 18:31.900
- That may or may not be so,

18:31.900 --> 18:34.740
but as of now, this case belongs to
Counter Terrorism,

18:34.740 --> 18:36.820
who will be dazzled

18:36.820 --> 18:41.500
and charmed by the extent of your
willingness to cooperate.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.940
Let's start by fetching Father
Chapman back for them.

18:46.020 --> 18:49.420
Maybe they'll have more luck
extracting a name than you did.

18:51.020 --> 18:53.220
[RINGING]

18:56.620 --> 18:58.060
Hello.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.260
- Dad?

18:59.260 --> 19:00.700
- Hey, you all right, sweet pea?

19:00.700 --> 19:04.340
- Don't call me that. Is it OK to go
to school?

19:04.340 --> 19:07.460
- Well, that's a new one! What are
you on about?

19:07.460 --> 19:09.620
- I heard it on the news.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.580
What if he comes to my school or
something?

19:11.580 --> 19:12.860
Like happens in America.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.140
- Hey, now you listen here.

19:14.140 --> 19:16.620
Look, he's just some twonk with
1,000 beefy-faced coppers

19:16.620 --> 19:18.100
chasing after him.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.740
- Promise, though?

19:19.740 --> 19:21.740
Cos he's well fearsome.

19:21.740 --> 19:24.540
- "Well fearsome"?! What you on
about?

19:24.540 --> 19:26.820
Look, he's just some wanker in a
mask.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.060
- Dad!

19:28.060 --> 19:29.460
- Well, he is!

19:29.460 --> 19:32.580
Now, you listen to me, young lady -
I will take him one-handed,

19:32.580 --> 19:35.220
with a Jaffa Cake stuffed in my
mouth,

19:35.220 --> 19:38.780
and be home before the chocolate's
melted. How's that?

19:38.780 --> 19:40.580
All right?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.020
All right, love you.

19:42.020 --> 19:43.420
- Love you.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.860
- You want to step away from this?

19:46.860 --> 19:48.020
- Absolutely not.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.100
- OK.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.500
- What's the plan?

19:50.500 --> 19:53.980
- OK, look, we, er, we let the
others show support for Counter
Terrorism,

19:53.980 --> 19:57.460
you know, interview witnesses, turn
the soil.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.380
You take that day as leave?

19:59.380 --> 20:00.820
- Not on your Nelly.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.220
- Right. Well, the boss is still
watching us.

20:03.220 --> 20:05.460
So do what he says. Go and see your
boy.

20:05.460 --> 20:07.380
- What about the priest?

20:07.380 --> 20:09.820
- OK. Look, Dennis is obviously not
going to cooperate -

20:09.820 --> 20:11.620
well, not willingly or deliberately
-

20:11.620 --> 20:14.260
and the killer knows that, so I
think we can use it against him.

20:14.260 --> 20:17.020
You know, tickle him out like a
trout.
- How?

20:17.020 --> 20:18.740
- Unethically.

20:20.060 --> 20:21.540
- Fair play.

20:21.540 --> 20:24.980
- Your mate, the, er, journalist,
the one that went into hiding?

20:24.980 --> 20:26.420
- Will?

20:26.420 --> 20:30.020
- Yeah. We know the killer's
watching him. We can use that.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.020
You think you can track him down?

20:32.020 --> 20:33.100
- Absolutely.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.220
- All right, good.

20:34.220 --> 20:35.380
- Where will you be?

20:38.340 --> 20:39.860
- Probably best you don't know.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.420
- Excuse me, sir, do you have a
second?

21:36.780 --> 21:38.060
- Absolutely.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.860
- Excellent! OK! Did you know that
cancer...

21:40.860 --> 21:42.260
- Why are you doing this?

21:44.100 --> 21:45.820
- Er... for Cancer Action UK.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.340
- OK. But why are YOU doing it?

21:48.340 --> 21:50.740
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.420
- Has cancer affected your life?

21:54.260 --> 21:56.940
- Right, with you.

21:56.940 --> 22:04.420
Well, I suppose I know people who it
has affected, so that's why...

22:04.420 --> 22:06.940
- But that's not why you're here,
doing it?

22:06.940 --> 22:09.580
- No. Not-not as such.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.500
But, yeah, well, it's actually a
job, so...

22:12.500 --> 22:15.860
- Which means you're basically a
cancer whore.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.620
- Er, well-well, I wouldn't say
that.

22:24.100 --> 22:27.580
I'm actually... I'm actually a
student. Hotel management.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.980
- Did you see it? Her room?

22:56.980 --> 23:00.460
- Yeah. Yeah, I saw it.

23:00.460 --> 23:03.820
- She's like a feral cat. You don't
want that thing stalking you.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.060
- No.

23:06.060 --> 23:08.580
- I assume the password worked?

23:08.580 --> 23:10.980
So...

23:10.980 --> 23:13.380
...the flash drive?

23:13.380 --> 23:16.780
- Oh, look, you're going to have to
give me a chance here.

23:16.780 --> 23:19.980
You know what she's like. Look,
she's got no-one.

23:19.980 --> 23:24.060
You know, no family. No friends. No
social life. No-one.

23:24.060 --> 23:25.820
No, all she's got is enemies.

23:25.820 --> 23:28.260
- Including her own son.

23:28.260 --> 23:30.620
- Which is why you went after him.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.780
- It was a sound idea, in theory.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.460
- Yeah, what theory was that?

23:37.460 --> 23:43.380
- If all she's got is enemies, which
enemy can she trust the most?

23:52.980 --> 23:54.940
- Look at that...

24:01.740 --> 24:05.020
- He rented the downstairs flat. And
there was just something about him.

24:05.020 --> 24:06.460
I don't know...

24:06.460 --> 24:09.220
- Going on about decadent this and
purifying that...

24:09.220 --> 24:11.820
- Two years ago he went to Macedonia
as an aid worker.

24:11.820 --> 24:13.300
Something happened over there.

24:13.300 --> 24:17.340
He came back and he was...
different.

24:17.340 --> 24:19.980
- I know it sounds mad, but I swear
it was him.

24:19.980 --> 24:24.220
Absolutely swear. I collect money
for cancer research.

24:24.220 --> 24:26.940
He called me a "cancer whore" and
then laughed.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.620
- Did you do this to me?

24:44.820 --> 24:47.060
Allow the press to release my name?

24:47.060 --> 24:49.540
- No. I wouldn't do that.

24:49.540 --> 24:50.900
But listen.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.700
This isn't going to get any easier.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.020
All right, you've been getting a lot
of death threats -

24:57.020 --> 24:58.980
we have to take that very seriously.

24:58.980 --> 25:02.140
You know, a lot of very scared
people are blaming you for this.

25:02.140 --> 25:06.300
- Make him stop! Catch him, for
Christ's sake!

25:06.300 --> 25:08.420
You're the police!

25:08.420 --> 25:12.020
- And you're the only person in
London that knows his name.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.220
Look, things have moved on quite a
bit.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.300
It's being treated as a terrorist
incident.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.820
It's not even my case any more.

25:20.820 --> 25:26.380
Look, I've been sent by Counter
Terrorism to see that you're
protected.

25:26.380 --> 25:28.820
So, if you'd like to accompany me,
please?

25:28.820 --> 25:31.700
- I suppose I don't have any say in
the matter?

25:32.940 --> 25:35.020
- Absolutely none. Sorry.

25:39.340 --> 25:42.220
- ...police presence in London has
been greatly increased.

25:42.220 --> 25:44.780
In related news, officers say
they're concerned

25:44.780 --> 25:48.100
for the safety of Father Dennis
Chapman, who's gone missing from

25:48.100 --> 25:52.020
his parish in Shepherd's Bush after
receiving dozens of death threats.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.060
- It's all kicking off out there.

25:55.060 --> 25:56.540
- Here. Take these.

26:02.380 --> 26:04.700
- Do you think Charlie's all up in
it?

26:04.700 --> 26:06.380
- Who knows?

26:06.380 --> 26:09.300
- Do you think he'll be OK?
- No-one's going to hurt Charlie
Hicks.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.100
- You can't say that, though.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.140
- I can totally say that. In fact, I
think I just heard myself saying
that.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.660
- You didn't say it about Dad.

26:17.580 --> 26:20.340
[RINGING]

26:24.420 --> 26:25.900
- Hello?

26:27.860 --> 26:30.300
I'm sorry. Who is this?

26:42.540 --> 26:43.700
Are you Elaine?

26:43.700 --> 26:44.900
- I am, yeah.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.980
- All right, well, then, what's
happening? What's this about?

26:49.380 --> 26:50.660
- Charlie Hicks.

26:52.460 --> 26:54.380
Listen, I know you two are close,

26:54.380 --> 26:56.140
but can I just be candid here?

26:56.140 --> 26:58.020
- Yeah. Please do. I mean, that'd be
nice.

26:58.020 --> 26:59.820
- And this is in total confidence
now.

26:59.820 --> 27:02.180
- Right. You're actually freaking me
out a bit.

27:05.740 --> 27:08.060
- Do you think he killed your
husband?

27:08.060 --> 27:12.940
- What?! No, of course not! Of
course he didn't!

27:12.940 --> 27:13.980
Jesus!

27:13.980 --> 27:16.380
- For what it's worth, I don't think
so, either.

27:16.380 --> 27:18.340
But some people disagree.

27:18.340 --> 27:19.580
- What people?

27:19.580 --> 27:20.620
- Serious people.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.980
Does he ever talk to you about it?

27:23.980 --> 27:25.620
- No. Why would he?

27:25.620 --> 27:28.220
- He knows they're coming for him,
Mari.

27:28.220 --> 27:30.700
And do you know what he's done to
clear his name? Nothing!

27:30.700 --> 27:34.020
- OK. You're going to need to slow
down for a second cos I'm-I'm-I'm
not following.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.460
- I'm just saying, why would he be
happy to walk around with it hanging
over his head?

27:37.460 --> 27:38.620
- I don't know.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.020
- Nor do I.

27:41.740 --> 27:43.060
Not really.

27:43.060 --> 27:44.860
Basically, I can only think of one
reason.

27:44.860 --> 27:46.020
- And what's that?

27:46.020 --> 27:47.900
- To protect someone he loves.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.900
- Right.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.540
And now are you accusing me of
something?

27:54.540 --> 27:57.820
- I am asking you. Completely off
the record.

27:57.820 --> 28:02.340
If you know anything - anything at
all - about your husband's death,

28:02.340 --> 28:03.460
you've got to tell me.

28:03.460 --> 28:08.220
Please. Because I think Charlie
really needs your help right now.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.780
I really do.

28:13.260 --> 28:15.140
- There's nothing.

28:18.580 --> 28:19.620
- OK.

28:22.020 --> 28:25.180
Can you do me a favour and just
think about it, all right?

28:26.740 --> 28:28.500
Just think about it for me.

28:36.420 --> 28:39.060
- And how do you answer your critics
who say you have to

28:39.060 --> 28:42.100
acknowledge a connection between
these crimes and the Hard Sun hoax

28:42.100 --> 28:43.820
which seems to have ended your
career?

28:43.820 --> 28:46.860
- Well, if my career had been ended,
I wouldn't be sitting here.

28:46.860 --> 28:49.940
- Well, given this man claims to be
motivated at least in part

28:49.940 --> 28:52.500
by that story, do you feel any sense
of responsibility?

28:52.500 --> 28:56.940
- Absolutely not. Look, however
warped his motivation,

28:56.940 --> 29:00.900
however deluded his world view, this
isn't about me.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.580
It's about people's right to know.

30:06.420 --> 30:10.420
- Oh, it's totally demented. We've
got multiple unconfirmed sightings,

30:10.420 --> 30:12.380
hundreds of witnesses,

30:12.380 --> 30:16.220
no usable CCTV footage, dozens of
confessions.

30:16.220 --> 30:18.740
People just keep adding straw onto
the haystack.

30:18.740 --> 30:21.660
The harder we look for him, the more
difficult he is to find.

30:21.660 --> 30:26.780
- Ask George to cross-reference
everyone coming forward against
Dennis' little black address book.

30:26.780 --> 30:28.380
Yeah, just to be sure.

30:28.380 --> 30:29.740
- Got it. Done and done.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.820
- All right.

31:06.660 --> 31:08.340
- What are you doing?

31:08.340 --> 31:10.660
- Oh, I'm sorry. Is there somewhere
you need to be?

31:10.660 --> 31:12.820
- I've got a home.

31:12.820 --> 31:17.420
- Oh, I wouldn't recommend it.
You're the most hated person in
London.

31:19.260 --> 31:21.580
- I'm sure the police can look after
me.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.420
- Well, why should we?

31:25.420 --> 31:30.140
Why should we waste our resources on
someone who refuses to help us?

31:30.140 --> 31:32.420
Or refuses to help himself, for that
matter.

31:34.020 --> 31:36.380
Why'd you become a priest, Dennis?

31:36.380 --> 31:38.540
- Because I wanted to serve God!

31:40.500 --> 31:41.900
- All right.

31:45.860 --> 31:49.980
Well, before that, ever been in love
-

31:49.980 --> 31:52.020
with an actual human being?

31:52.020 --> 31:55.420
- I've loved. And I've been loved.

31:55.420 --> 31:58.820
- And you gave it all up. For God?

31:58.820 --> 32:00.700
- Yeah.

32:00.700 --> 32:03.540
- You never felt like maybe He was
asking for quite a lot?

32:03.540 --> 32:05.340
- Course I did.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.780
- Yeah, I mean, after all that,
after everything you gave up,

32:08.780 --> 32:11.100
you think-you think this is what He
wants for you?

32:11.100 --> 32:13.340
Right here, now? Today?

32:13.340 --> 32:15.980
You've heard of waterboarding, I
expect?

32:17.580 --> 32:20.940
- Stop now, Charlie. Enough.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.340
- I mean, honestly, it's, er,

32:23.340 --> 32:26.940
well, it's one of the worst things
that can happen to someone.

32:26.940 --> 32:30.180
Yeah, even the, er, the Special
Forces...

32:30.180 --> 32:32.860
You know, people that are trained
for it, you know, hard men

32:32.860 --> 32:34.740
and women,

32:34.740 --> 32:37.620
even they can't stand it for more
than a few seconds.

32:37.620 --> 32:40.660
You know, it's only ever used as an
absolute last resort.

32:40.660 --> 32:42.100
It's very effective, though.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.660
- You don't want to do this.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.300
- No, you're right, I don't.

32:45.300 --> 32:46.740
- So don't do it.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.460
- Well, then, don't make me.

32:49.580 --> 32:54.220
- This isn't you, Charlie. You're a
good man.

32:55.860 --> 32:57.580
You have a kind heart.

32:58.620 --> 33:01.700
But you can't hide that kind of
heart.

33:01.700 --> 33:04.020
- I'm a good man, am I?

33:07.940 --> 33:10.260
- You don't need to do this.

33:10.260 --> 33:12.900
- Then tell me what I need to know
and it doesn't have to happen.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.780
- Don't put yourself through this!

33:14.780 --> 33:16.220
- Then let me stop!

33:16.220 --> 33:18.140
- I can't do this!
- You can!

33:18.140 --> 33:20.700
- Who is he?
- For your own sake!

33:20.700 --> 33:22.860
- WHO IS HE?!

33:22.860 --> 33:25.460
- Let me go!

33:25.460 --> 33:27.300
- Go where, Dennis?

33:27.300 --> 33:28.980
Huh? Go where?

33:28.980 --> 33:31.180
I mean, where is there you can go?

33:31.180 --> 33:34.660
The people are scared and they blame
you, and scared people

33:34.660 --> 33:35.980
do terrible things.

33:37.220 --> 33:38.980
They'll crucify you.

33:38.980 --> 33:40.540
They'll rip you to pieces!

33:40.540 --> 33:43.620
- People are animals.
- You don't think that.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.660
- Oh, I more than think it.

33:48.140 --> 33:50.180
- Are you a gambling man, Charlie?

33:55.380 --> 33:56.740
- Why?

33:58.420 --> 34:01.980
- Because I'm offering a wager.

34:01.980 --> 34:04.900
If you agree to let me go,

34:04.900 --> 34:07.180
we'll tell everyone where I am.

34:07.180 --> 34:11.300
Everyone - and then we'll see who
comes.

34:13.580 --> 34:16.100
- OK, looks like the priest's on
board.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.020
- What? He gave you a name?

34:18.020 --> 34:21.340
- Yeah, well, not in so many words,
but, yeah.

34:21.340 --> 34:24.500
I think I've talked him round. How'd
it go your end?

34:24.500 --> 34:26.900
Ready to spread the word?

34:26.900 --> 34:29.460
- I'm good to go.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.980
[KNOCKING]

34:40.980 --> 34:43.139
- It's me.

34:43.139 --> 34:44.900
Let me in.

34:44.900 --> 34:46.420
- No.

34:46.420 --> 34:49.300
- I will break down your door down
if I have to.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.699
- How-how did you find me?

34:50.699 --> 34:52.219
- ISP. You answered my e-mails.

34:53.620 --> 34:57.020
- Wait a minute! I thought that was
a booty call.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.300
You were playing me?

34:58.300 --> 35:00.660
- Like a Swanee whistle. Open the
door.

35:00.660 --> 35:04.020
- All that stuff about your son, was
that even true?

35:04.020 --> 35:05.780
- Of course not.

35:05.780 --> 35:09.260
- Oh, shit, Elaine! That... That's
pretty dark.

35:09.260 --> 35:11.300
That-that's not the sort of thing
you lie about!

35:11.300 --> 35:12.580
Your son tried to kill himself!

35:12.580 --> 35:14.420
- Well, you should've come to me
with this, Will -

35:14.420 --> 35:16.620
not just run to a newspaper, used it
to save yourself.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.900
- Oh! The reason I lost my job in
the first place is

35:18.900 --> 35:21.820
because you ran to a newspaper to do
exactly the same thing.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.900
- I've got something for you.

35:25.140 --> 35:26.700
Another story.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.460
- What story? Why?

35:29.460 --> 35:31.620
- Because I need it out there,
unofficially,

35:31.620 --> 35:34.340
and it cannot be traced to me, ever.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.340
- Why not?

35:36.340 --> 35:40.060
- Because I'm trying to catch a
spree killer before he kills anyone
else.

35:41.780 --> 35:43.860
And if I'm going to do that...

35:45.820 --> 35:47.580
...I need you...

35:50.500 --> 35:53.540
I need you to hang Dennis Chapman
out to dry for me.

36:17.860 --> 36:20.460
- All right, you need to understand
this, now.

36:20.460 --> 36:25.220
No-one is going to be protecting
you. No-one will be watching you.

36:25.220 --> 36:27.820
And no-one will help you. You are
completely alone.

36:30.860 --> 36:36.300
- One of the advantages of my line
of work - you're never alone.

36:53.860 --> 36:55.500
- Dennis.

36:55.500 --> 36:58.060
- Thank you for this.

36:59.740 --> 37:03.580
[RINGING]

37:04.980 --> 37:06.300
- Boss?

37:06.300 --> 37:07.700
- I need you to do me a favour.

37:07.700 --> 37:10.180
I need you to dig out an old file,
late '90s.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.260
Rape of a minor.

37:13.260 --> 37:15.620
- What, connected to this thing?

37:15.620 --> 37:17.100
- No. Listen...

37:17.100 --> 37:20.460
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't
important. You know that.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.780
- All right, give me the details.

37:27.740 --> 37:30.060
- Dennis, this sounds very risky.

37:30.060 --> 37:32.620
I'd like to stay with you, if I may?

37:36.460 --> 37:40.140
- I'd like it, too. But I can't have
that, Michael.

37:41.740 --> 37:45.140
I can't have your safety on my
conscience.

38:02.140 --> 38:05.500
- Not only has Father Dennis refused
all offers of protection,

38:05.500 --> 38:09.420
he's refused to put at risk anyone
whom the killer might believe

38:09.420 --> 38:13.940
to be helping him and thereby making
them a potential target.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.220
In the last few minutes, Father
Dennis

38:16.220 --> 38:18.580
has tweeted from an undisclosed
location,

38:18.580 --> 38:21.460
thanking people for their offers of
support.

38:21.460 --> 38:25.420
So all we know is, as London holds
its collective breath tonight,

38:25.420 --> 38:32.060
Father Dennis is alone, with his
God, his faith and his conscience.

38:32.060 --> 38:36.940
[RINGING]

38:36.940 --> 38:38.860
- He's done it. He's posted the
story.

38:38.860 --> 38:40.620
- OK, good.

38:40.620 --> 38:43.060
- And if the killer can smell what
we're doing?

38:43.060 --> 38:46.260
- Nah, he's too wrapped up in his
own shit to smell anything else.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.980
Look, he'll just think that it's
Dennis leaving him a message,

38:48.980 --> 38:52.420
you know - "Here I am. I'm alone and
I want to talk."

38:53.460 --> 38:55.740
Look, trust me, he's a gloating
bastard,

38:55.740 --> 38:57.460
he won't be able to resist it.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.740
- And how does Dennis feel about
that?

38:59.740 --> 39:02.020
- Well, he's pretending not to know
that's how it is.

39:02.020 --> 39:03.460
- What, that you've staked him out

39:03.460 --> 39:05.220
on a leash like the goat in Jurassic
Park?

39:05.220 --> 39:08.980
- Yeah, I believe it's called a lie
of omissions - you don't ask,

39:08.980 --> 39:10.540
you don't tell.

39:10.540 --> 39:13.060
Look, I need you here as soon as you
can.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.900
- All right, I'm on my way.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.300
- All right.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.580
- Any news on the flash drive?

39:39.700 --> 39:41.300
- No, not as such.

39:42.740 --> 39:45.420
Although, er, something you said did
ring a bell.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.660
Something about trusting your enemy.

39:50.340 --> 39:51.500
- Go on.

39:55.540 --> 40:00.700
- All right, look, when she was 14,
Elaine Renko's parents

40:00.700 --> 40:04.300
brought in a complaint of rape,
against a teacher.

40:05.540 --> 40:08.980
Yeah, a guy named... Noah Underhill.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.900
He taught English.

40:14.780 --> 40:17.100
And then Elaine denied everything,

40:17.100 --> 40:19.500
claimed she'd been assaulted by a
stranger,

40:19.500 --> 40:21.620
so the investigation didn't go
anywhere.

40:22.860 --> 40:26.140
- So she was a lying, intransigent
bitch even back then.

40:27.940 --> 40:29.860
Well, you do have to wonder why.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.300
- Well, not really.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.900
No, she was a kid. She was scared.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.460
You know, maybe she thought she was
in love.

40:38.460 --> 40:41.260
Maybe she just wanted it all to come
to an end.

40:41.260 --> 40:43.140
But whatever, she saved his career

40:43.140 --> 40:45.340
and most likely kept him out of
prison.

40:46.740 --> 40:49.860
So, if there's one favour she can
call on,

40:49.860 --> 40:52.500
one enemy she can trust...

40:55.220 --> 40:56.940
...well, he's your man.

40:58.700 --> 41:00.420
- This is good work, Charlie.

41:01.900 --> 41:04.220
This is really good.

41:04.220 --> 41:06.620
- Right, so now you need to make
good on your end.

41:08.620 --> 41:12.820
You make sure that my family are
well looked after.

41:14.980 --> 41:16.780
- Right up until the end.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.180
- And don't hurt her.

41:21.180 --> 41:24.020
Elaine. You don't need to hurt her.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.300
- Mishal.

41:46.300 --> 41:47.580
- Hm?

41:49.460 --> 41:51.020
- Miriam Blackwood.

41:51.020 --> 41:53.300
She was worried about her son -
devout Catholic,

41:53.300 --> 41:55.260
some kind of aid worker.

41:55.260 --> 41:58.620
Apparently, he worked with Dennis
Chapman at an inner-city
night-shelter.

41:58.620 --> 42:01.300
And here's his name, in Dennis'
address book.

42:02.620 --> 42:06.620
- OK. Let's check him out. I'll
update Counter Terror.

- Looks like Blackwood's our man.

43:12.580 --> 43:14.780
- We've got a name for you.

43:57.940 --> 44:00.060
- Help me! Please! Somebody!

44:00.060 --> 44:01.700
- We should help.

44:01.700 --> 44:04.300
- The police warned us about helping
strangers.

44:04.300 --> 44:07.620
OK? It was on the news. Just call
999.

44:07.620 --> 44:10.060
- No, you call them.

- Dia! Dia!

45:46.340 --> 45:48.940
Yeah. What's up?

45:58.460 --> 45:59.780
They've got him.

45:59.780 --> 46:01.380
He's dead.

46:06.500 --> 46:07.900
So who is he?

46:07.900 --> 46:11.380
- William Cherry. 48. Unmarried
driving instructor.

46:11.380 --> 46:12.780
- Was he on the list?

46:12.780 --> 46:16.020
- Top of it. Counter Terrorism had
him flagged as prime suspect.

46:16.020 --> 46:18.900
History of psychiatric problems,
religious mania.

46:18.900 --> 46:21.180
Promising God's vengeance on
sinners.

46:21.180 --> 46:22.660
That sort of fun and games.

46:22.660 --> 46:24.900
- Yeah, but is there any connection
to Dennis Chapman?

46:24.900 --> 46:26.820
- Sorry, boss, not really.

46:26.820 --> 46:29.460
- Counter Terror's profiler thinks
it was random.

46:29.460 --> 46:31.900
They reckon he did make a
confession.

46:31.900 --> 46:33.220
You were right about that.

46:33.220 --> 46:36.860
He was probably in the first church
he stumbled across after killing
Jamie Unwin.

46:36.860 --> 46:38.780
- Oh, shit!

46:38.780 --> 46:41.460
All right, we'll leave the paperwork
to the victors.

47:18.980 --> 47:21.260
I suppose I'd better tell Dennis
face-to-face.

47:21.260 --> 47:22.660
I at least owe him that.

47:22.660 --> 47:24.260
- Do you think he'll press charges?

47:24.260 --> 47:27.700
- Nah, the bloke's a Christian. Let
him forgive me.

47:27.700 --> 47:30.180
- So how do you say sorry for
waterboarding someone?

47:30.180 --> 47:33.860
- Yeah, all right, threatening to
waterboard someone - it's a
different kettle of fish.

47:33.860 --> 47:36.220
- Oh, completely.
- Why? Do you think I would have
done it?

47:36.220 --> 47:38.020
- You'd totally have done it.

48:30.820 --> 48:33.300
- Someone recognised the neon
crucifix.

In your Tweet.

48:36.660 --> 48:38.780
When it was on the news.

48:38.780 --> 48:40.540
Word got around.

no stopping them.

- Boss, sorry to do this to you, but
they've got the wrong man.

49:11.700 --> 49:14.140
- What?
- The dead man at Thamesview was a
copycat.

49:14.140 --> 49:17.020
I think we're looking for a man
called Blackwood, Thomas Blackwood.

49:17.020 --> 49:19.580
- All right, on a scale of one to
ten, how sure are you?

49:19.580 --> 49:20.860
- Ten.

49:20.860 --> 49:22.980
Well, nine point something
recurring.

49:22.980 --> 49:24.740
But I'm in a minority of one.

49:24.740 --> 49:27.460
I already reported this to Counter
Terror and to Bell,

49:27.460 --> 49:29.940
but they don't want to hear it. But
they're wrong.

- All right, now, listen, you send
me what you've got.

49:33.460 --> 49:36.220
You tell Armed Response to go to The
Sacred Heart Church

49:36.220 --> 49:38.500
and to do it quietly.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.380
- On our way.
- All right, good.

49:40.380 --> 49:42.620
Right, he's saying we've got the
wrong man on the slab.

49:42.620 --> 49:45.340
- Do you think he's in there?
- Oh, shit, I don't know.

49:45.340 --> 49:47.020
I've been trying to tickle him out.

49:47.020 --> 49:49.420
I didn't expect the Glastonbury
festival to turn up.

49:49.420 --> 49:52.220
- Well, we can't wait for Armed
Response.

49:55.260 --> 49:57.380
- It's very moving.

50:49.340 --> 50:51.220
Erm...

50:51.220 --> 50:54.860
I look at your faces...

50:56.500 --> 51:00.060
...and you all seem

51:00.060 --> 51:07.020
so content in your bravery and
goodness.

51:08.460 --> 51:11.780
So keen to be congratulated.

51:12.940 --> 51:19.020
But, looking out at the faces before
me...

51:20.820 --> 51:23.620
...I don't see goodness.

51:23.620 --> 51:29.540
And I don't see self-sacrifice.

51:29.540 --> 51:32.940
I see a rabble

51:32.940 --> 51:35.500
of complacent

51:35.500 --> 51:38.460
self-satisfied

51:38.460 --> 51:40.060
narcissists.

51:41.140 --> 51:47.620
Now, you... You may not like what
I'm saying,

51:47.620 --> 51:55.060
but it's truth, and the truth will
save you.

51:56.660 --> 51:58.300
You're contemptible.

51:59.380 --> 52:03.020
And I need you out of here.

52:03.020 --> 52:05.780
All of you, out of my sight!

52:07.780 --> 52:09.100
- No!

52:16.060 --> 52:19.020
- Leave! Everyone! Go!

52:23.100 --> 52:25.260
[SCREAMING]

52:35.180 --> 52:39.940
- Ha, ha, ha! Oh, yes, Dennis!

52:42.420 --> 52:47.580
You were telling the truth up there.
That's all I wanted.

52:47.580 --> 52:49.740
For you to know the truth.

52:49.740 --> 52:50.980
- Stop!

52:52.220 --> 52:53.580
Enough!

52:55.020 --> 52:57.020
Bring him here.

53:12.660 --> 53:19.420
He tried to attack me and I defended
myself as best I could,

53:19.420 --> 53:22.860
until you managed to restrain him.

53:22.860 --> 53:26.300
- Are you sure you want to do this
to yourself, Dennis?

53:26.300 --> 53:28.220
- It's already done.

53:55.580 --> 53:57.140
Can you hear Him now, Thom?

53:58.540 --> 53:59.980
Can you hear Him?

54:02.540 --> 54:04.100
Because I can.

54:05.540 --> 54:06.580
Oh, I can hear Him.

54:07.900 --> 54:10.100
Oh, yes!

54:10.100 --> 54:12.580
- Oh, oh, Dennis!

54:14.100 --> 54:15.420
- Do you hear that?

54:17.380 --> 54:20.180
Do you hear Him, Thom?

54:31.140 --> 54:34.660
- I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING!

56:54.540 --> 56:56.980
- Hi, I'm Gretchen Ross from Social
Services.

56:56.980 --> 56:59.860
- Someone on high wants Charlie
Hicks.

56:59.860 --> 57:01.900
- You just keep your people out of
my way.

57:01.900 --> 57:03.620
- Could you just look him in the eye

57:03.620 --> 57:05.820
and... tell him it wasn't his fault?

57:05.820 --> 57:08.860
- I will kill you stone dead.

57:08.860 --> 57:11.140
I will finish you!

57:11.140 --> 57:13.180
- I just want to treasure what we've
got...

57:13.180 --> 57:14.460
...while we've got it.

57:14.460 --> 57:16.500
- I can take it all away.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.860
All the people you love.

57:18.860 --> 57:20.460
- Here they come...

57:21.780 --> 57:23.420
...ready or not.

57:26.980 --> 57:28.620
- Oh...

57:28.620 --> 57:30.780
...here comes trouble.
