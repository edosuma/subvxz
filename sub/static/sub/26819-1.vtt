- <i>The stain is gone.</i>
- <i>That's a huge difference.</i>

01:41.006 --> 01:43.105
<i>You could see how it was really...</i>

01:43.107 --> 01:44.238
You here?

01:44.240 --> 01:46.272
No. I'm running late.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.503
How late?

01:47.505 --> 01:49.738
- Maybe... An hour, maybe?
- Shh!

01:49.740 --> 01:53.004
- An hour?
- Yeah. I got... I got held up.

01:53.006 --> 01:54.271
Shh!

01:54.273 --> 01:57.439
So the deafening war between
Spam and OxiClean is okay,

01:57.441 --> 01:59.241
and I can't make
a two-second call?

01:59.873 --> 02:01.405
- Hang it up.
- <i>Viv...</i>

02:01.407 --> 02:03.038
everybody's here waiting.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.771
Okay. Okay.

02:04.773 --> 02:06.570
<i>...the
stain-fighting power of OxiClean!</i>

02:06.572 --> 02:07.740
<i>Stains on T-shirts!</i>

02:08.039 --> 02:09.471
<i>I see it coming out
pretty quickly.</i>

02:09.473 --> 02:11.104
<i>The stain is gone.</i>

02:11.106 --> 02:12.870
<i>That's a huge difference.</i>

02:12.872 --> 02:14.871
<i>You can see
how it was really disgusting</i>

02:14.873 --> 02:16.704
<i>and how white it is now.</i>

02:16.706 --> 02:18.374
<i>Looks like
the stain is coming out.</i>

02:18.906 --> 02:19.940
<i>Dr. Peter,
please call Locating.</i>

02:20.572 --> 02:22.606
<i>Dr. Peter,
please call Locating.</i>

02:23.140 --> 02:24.771
<i>...number-one
versatile stain remover.</i>

02:24.773 --> 02:26.607
- <i>Now get the power...</i>
- Come on, Mom.

02:27.640 --> 02:28.807
It'll be okay.

02:29.074 --> 02:31.074
<i>OxiClean
gets the tough stains out!</i>

02:32.139 --> 02:33.073
Come on.

02:34.573 --> 02:37.904
<i>For a sandwich that
rocks, try a Spam, lettuce, and tomato.</i>

02:37.906 --> 02:40.340
<i>More fun ideas at spam.com.</i>

02:41.439 --> 02:43.938
<i>We're on the
road, showing real people</i>

02:43.940 --> 02:46.738
<i>the stain-fighting power
of OxiClean.</i>

02:46.740 --> 02:48.238
<i>Stains on T-shirts!</i>

02:48.240 --> 02:49.604
<i>I see it coming out pretty...</i>

02:58.573 --> 03:00.074
Ms. Cahala?

03:01.073 --> 03:02.274
Ms. Cahala?

03:03.340 --> 03:05.437
<i>...versatile stain remover.</i>

03:05.439 --> 03:07.338
<i>It was really
disgusting and how white it is now.</i>

03:07.340 --> 03:09.274
- <i>Get the power of OxiClean...</i>
- Excuse me.

03:09.605 --> 03:11.470
<i>One cap beats four of theirs.</i>

03:11.472 --> 03:13.439
- This way.
- <i>OxiClean gets the tough stains...</i>

03:16.973 --> 03:17.941
Here.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.840
You can see it.

03:22.173 --> 03:25.607
That's what's been causing
the headaches.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.604
Now, until we can look at
the tissue under a microscope,

03:31.606 --> 03:33.837
I can't tell you
with total certainty,

03:33.839 --> 03:38.606
but it looks like
a very aggressive glioblastoma.

03:39.573 --> 03:43.470
Now, we can remove as much of
it as possible with surgery,

03:43.472 --> 03:47.174
but there are serious risks
to mobility,

03:47.673 --> 03:51.574
to language skills,
musical ability.

03:54.972 --> 03:56.137
Um...

03:56.139 --> 03:57.474
my singing?

03:58.505 --> 04:00.573
Possibly, yes.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.507
Um...

04:10.307 --> 04:11.641
Um...

04:16.173 --> 04:17.107
Sorry.

04:18.206 --> 04:19.606
Take your time.

04:29.339 --> 04:30.573
So...

04:33.174 --> 04:34.738
I'm sorry.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.440
So, um...

04:37.173 --> 04:40.706
so w-what does this mean?

04:41.174 --> 04:42.704
With successful surgery

04:42.706 --> 04:45.871
and some combination
of radiation and chemo,

04:45.873 --> 04:49.941
the average rate of survival
is 14 months.

04:53.406 --> 04:54.707
And without?

04:55.973 --> 04:56.974
Less.

04:58.305 --> 04:59.973
Significantly less.

05:04.739 --> 05:08.873
We'll have the blood test
results tomorrow.

05:09.806 --> 05:11.539
We'll need to take more then.

05:12.239 --> 05:16.274
I'm going to recommend
Dr. Patel do your surgeries,

05:16.707 --> 05:19.275
best surgeon
for this kind of brain tumor.

05:19.906 --> 05:23.104
I also suggest that you establish
your own personal team

05:23.106 --> 05:27.773
with friends and family who you
can call on when you need them.

05:28.772 --> 05:30.603
This is going to be
a very intense,

05:30.605 --> 05:32.670
rigorous period of time
for treatment,

05:32.672 --> 05:36.606
but you have
the best team possible.

06:03.372 --> 06:05.004
You see, there's a
difference, of course,

06:05.006 --> 06:08.940
where... when you
talk tautology...

06:14.940 --> 06:17.637
Yeah, we been waiting for,
like, 10 minutes! Let's move it!

06:17.639 --> 06:20.437
Hey, Emma, wait up for me!

07:02.772 --> 07:05.673
- Hey, watch out.
- Oh! Hey, yeah, you watch out!

07:06.672 --> 07:08.073
Ooh!

07:08.840 --> 07:10.071
- Just...
- I'm so sorry.

07:10.073 --> 07:11.573
Just watch where you're going.

07:12.006 --> 07:13.504
Watch where you're going.

07:13.506 --> 07:15.674
Jesus fucking Christ.

07:25.672 --> 07:27.204
<i>Ma chérie,</i> where are you?

07:27.206 --> 07:29.837
<i>I've called and called.
I forgot my keys.</i>

07:29.839 --> 07:32.673
I had to bribe that terrifying
doorman of yours to let me in.

07:33.205 --> 07:34.738
I don't know
how you can live here.

07:34.740 --> 07:37.637
<i>Darling, I have a constant
anxiety attack.</i>

07:37.639 --> 07:39.037
Then why do you always visit me?

07:39.039 --> 07:40.537
<i>I know you have rehearsal.</i>

07:40.539 --> 07:43.239
Call me with the address,
and I'll meet you there.

07:58.238 --> 07:59.206
Nah.

08:03.605 --> 08:04.806
No.

08:07.306 --> 08:11.140
Oh. It sucks for morale
when you're late like this.

08:11.972 --> 08:14.140
They're fine. They love me.

08:14.573 --> 08:17.971
Everybody loves you, but it's still
totally fucking unprofessional.

08:17.973 --> 08:19.807
You're totally
fucking right.

08:20.572 --> 08:21.905
I'm serious.

08:21.907 --> 08:23.840
I know you're serious,
'cause you're swearing.

08:25.406 --> 08:26.405
Come on.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.404
You still have that interview
today right after.

08:29.406 --> 08:31.671
- What about <i>The Times?</i>
- I pushed hard. They passed.

08:31.673 --> 08:34.474
You should have let me pitch
the 20th anniversary angle.

08:34.938 --> 08:38.172
You know how I hate
commemorating shit like that.

08:38.938 --> 08:40.438
"Milestones."

08:40.440 --> 08:41.804
Ugh.

08:41.806 --> 08:43.140
Just the worst.

08:44.006 --> 08:45.374
And, anyway...

08:46.105 --> 08:48.040
it's 25 years.

08:48.773 --> 08:51.340
Really? Fuck.

08:55.339 --> 08:58.173
- Tickets?
- Good. Selling.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.770
Good.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.538
Actually, um, you have
an offer for Amsterdam,

09:11.540 --> 09:14.373
two nights at Café Alto
if you want them.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.807
Right before Scandinavia,
we have space.

09:20.806 --> 09:22.973
We always had
a good time in Amsterdam.

09:23.972 --> 09:25.206
We did.

09:27.807 --> 09:28.974
You okay?

09:32.505 --> 09:33.506
Hmm?

09:39.007 --> 09:40.974
My mother is here, so no.

09:42.006 --> 09:43.637
You know,
she called me today.

09:43.639 --> 09:45.306
- What?
- Repeatedly.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.307
- What?
- Yeah.

09:47.672 --> 09:48.907
What did she say?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.036
Are you kidding?

09:51.038 --> 09:53.007
Why would I ever
pick up that call?

09:55.005 --> 09:56.573
Did you hear
from Carnegie Hall?

09:57.005 --> 09:59.870
Yeah, we were talking
about a festival bill

09:59.872 --> 10:01.874
or a Late Night
at Zankel Hall.

10:03.372 --> 10:04.841
Well, when?

10:05.872 --> 10:08.573
You can't be obsessed
about one place.

10:09.006 --> 10:11.507
Things are good, okay?

10:11.907 --> 10:13.173
Okay.

10:13.573 --> 10:15.072
Think about Amsterdam.

10:17.272 --> 10:18.273
I will.

10:18.673 --> 10:19.907
We should go in.

10:20.539 --> 10:21.473
Okay.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.537
I know. I know.

10:24.539 --> 10:26.373
I'm the worst. I suck.

10:27.305 --> 10:30.740
If you guys want to quit,
be my guest.

10:31.038 --> 10:33.273
It's only a three-day gig
at Birdland.

10:35.306 --> 10:37.307
And I know you all have...

10:39.572 --> 10:41.438
so much weed to smoke,

10:41.440 --> 10:45.273
so many video games to play.

10:45.773 --> 10:47.040
All right.

10:47.573 --> 10:48.606
So we're good?

10:49.038 --> 10:51.373
You got it, Mama.
Of course we're good.

10:52.205 --> 10:54.039
- Hi, Greg.
- Hey.

10:54.971 --> 10:56.640
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

10:57.839 --> 10:59.072
Pete!

11:00.706 --> 11:03.003
Okay. Let's just
warm up with that, okay?

11:03.005 --> 11:04.407
- All right.
- Okay.

11:04.907 --> 11:06.737
We only got 'til 2:30, so...

11:06.739 --> 11:08.406
- All right.
- Let's get to it.

11:08.740 --> 11:09.907
Thanks.

11:10.506 --> 11:11.439
Hello.

11:52.105 --> 11:54.038
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:57.105 --> 11:58.474
You wanna get coffee?

12:00.039 --> 12:02.072
Can't. Interview.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.006
Okay.

12:15.871 --> 12:18.206
You have to listen...
listen to some of the '70s.

12:18.573 --> 12:20.540
Yeah, you know,
the '70s funk's...

13:02.838 --> 13:06.507
Hey! If they find you using
that room, they're gonna charge me,

13:06.806 --> 13:09.972
so either get going or give
'em a credit card number!

13:10.373 --> 13:12.638
Yeah, yeah,
we're, uh, we're on it.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.706
Okay.

13:16.073 --> 13:18.206
You're bad.

13:40.339 --> 13:42.070
Ma chérie, <i>where are you?</i>

13:42.072 --> 13:43.803
<i>I can't worry like this
at my age,</i>

13:43.805 --> 13:45.903
<i>but I do worry
when I don't have news.</i>

13:45.905 --> 13:47.338
<i>Tell me
when you will be here.</i>

13:48.672 --> 13:51.506
No. Just speak, Liviya!
I'm late!

13:52.239 --> 13:53.641
Liviya, listen to me!

13:54.905 --> 13:56.006
Seriously?

13:56.239 --> 13:58.236
No, because I don't have time
for your shit!

13:58.238 --> 14:00.671
No, Liv, that's not fair...

14:00.673 --> 14:01.673
Come on!

14:02.906 --> 14:04.073
So, Liv, I gotta...

14:04.506 --> 14:07.073
I gotta... Th-That's not...
Are you gonna let me finish?

14:07.805 --> 14:10.439
Okay. Seriously, stop it.

14:25.439 --> 14:28.303
Hi. May I see the...
the dress in the window?

14:28.305 --> 14:29.839
- Sure.
- Thanks.

15:54.272 --> 15:55.439
There you are.

15:57.605 --> 15:59.273
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

16:10.472 --> 16:12.374
That looks great on you.

16:13.705 --> 16:14.639
Thanks.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.704
Hi.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.272
I'm sorry about
the location change.

17:23.605 --> 17:26.770
Yeah. Online, it said
the restaurant was closed,

17:26.771 --> 17:29.107
but I thought maybe
you knew something I didn't.

17:29.672 --> 17:32.603
Yeah. I... I just forgot.

17:32.605 --> 17:34.605
It's been there for so long.

17:35.139 --> 17:37.036
- Hi. Oona.
- Vivienne.

17:37.038 --> 17:39.039
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

17:39.473 --> 17:40.740
You went there a lot?

17:41.405 --> 17:44.140
Um, in my early
New York days, yeah.

17:44.971 --> 17:46.872
Said a lot of famous people
went there.

17:49.173 --> 17:52.007
I met Donald O'Connor
once there.

17:55.472 --> 17:57.538
- Do you know who he is?
- Sure.

18:01.073 --> 18:02.040
Anyway...

18:02.639 --> 18:04.036
So I usually record.

18:04.038 --> 18:04.972
Sure.

18:12.239 --> 18:17.006
So this weekend celebrates your
25th anniversary at Birdland.

18:17.340 --> 18:19.072
Hard to believe, but yes.

18:19.872 --> 18:23.740
And as a seasoned veteran
on that scene,

18:24.038 --> 18:27.373
what do you appreciate most
about where you are now?

18:31.205 --> 18:32.439
Um...

18:35.172 --> 18:36.839
Well, I'm... I'm...

18:39.173 --> 18:41.940
grateful to have a... a life...

18:45.372 --> 18:46.605
in music,

18:47.239 --> 18:49.573
to mostly be able
to pay my bills,

18:49.905 --> 18:54.072
play legendary clubs
with musicians that I admire.

18:56.072 --> 18:57.470
I mean, sure, there are...

18:57.472 --> 19:00.039
there are things that
I haven't achieved, but...

19:04.039 --> 19:05.473
I'm not done yet.

19:07.205 --> 19:10.139
And you have a new album?

19:10.471 --> 19:12.373
I do, yeah. It's my ninth.

19:12.738 --> 19:15.407
I mean, if you don't count the duets album.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.136
Believe me,
I don't count that album.

19:17.138 --> 19:19.072
Oh, a lot of people
liked that record.

19:19.471 --> 19:21.073
Well, bless their hearts.

19:22.772 --> 19:25.070
And the new one's called...

19:25.072 --> 19:26.306
- <i>3rd & A.</i>
- Okay.

19:26.739 --> 19:28.473
That's where I first lived
in New York.

19:28.905 --> 19:30.905
- 3rd and A.
- It's great around there.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.473
Yeah, I mean, it is now,
but then it was...

19:38.905 --> 19:40.004
Anyway.

19:40.006 --> 19:44.407
So a lot of people
think <i>3rd & A</i>

19:44.739 --> 19:48.740
is about your breakup
last year...

19:49.872 --> 19:52.373
with your fellow musician.

19:53.273 --> 19:56.503
My inspiration comes
from many different places,

19:56.505 --> 19:57.773
many different things.

19:59.805 --> 20:02.606
So your broken engagement
didn't influence the album?

20:04.373 --> 20:05.773
Uh...

20:07.639 --> 20:09.207
All of my albums

20:09.805 --> 20:13.438
have been influenced
by all of my broken engagements.

20:21.805 --> 20:24.505
I also have some
incredible musicians,

20:25.138 --> 20:28.170
um, joining me
for the weekend shows,

20:28.172 --> 20:29.640
Diana Krall for sure.

20:30.972 --> 20:32.804
My manager will have
all the other details,

20:32.806 --> 20:34.569
you know, about the others.

20:34.571 --> 20:37.372
He'll have the...
those details tomorrow.

20:37.671 --> 20:38.573
Great.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.873
So this is just a couple paragraphs
with some stuff about the new album.

20:44.471 --> 20:46.905
I think I have
what I need.

20:50.671 --> 20:52.206
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:00.805 --> 21:02.006
Anything else?

21:02.939 --> 21:05.173
No. That was plenty, I guess.

21:05.671 --> 21:06.773
Thank you.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.107
Hi.

21:37.206 --> 21:38.539
Hey.

21:40.371 --> 21:41.705
Hey.

21:42.205 --> 21:43.106
You need anything?

21:43.404 --> 21:46.207
No, no, no.
Nah, I was just walking by.

21:47.539 --> 21:49.073
Couldn't resist coming in.

21:50.372 --> 21:52.536
This weekend. Can't wait.

21:52.538 --> 21:53.637
Yeah. Me neither.

21:53.639 --> 21:56.271
Your new stuff live,

21:56.273 --> 21:57.873
it's gonna be killer.

21:58.206 --> 21:59.369
I hope so.

21:59.371 --> 22:00.972
It's your best yet.

22:01.471 --> 22:02.570
No.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.173
You know I don't blow smoke.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.740
Not about the music, anyway.

22:10.439 --> 22:11.737
Oh, shit.

22:11.739 --> 22:13.106
I have to take this.

22:13.971 --> 22:15.773
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:17.405 --> 22:18.573
You will.

22:25.572 --> 22:27.505
- Hello.
- <i>This is your Lyft driver.</i>

22:27.906 --> 22:29.905
- <i>I'm pulling up right now.</i>
- Okay.

22:33.139 --> 22:34.173
Shit.

22:43.438 --> 22:44.706
Yeah, one second.

22:47.438 --> 22:49.303
- Hi. Vivienne?
- Huh?

22:49.305 --> 22:50.605
- Vivienne?
- Yeah.

22:52.772 --> 22:53.973
You have the address?

22:54.272 --> 22:55.206
Yeah.

23:29.138 --> 23:30.170
No!

23:30.172 --> 23:31.305
No, I am!

23:51.505 --> 23:53.006
Hey, can you turn that down?

23:54.072 --> 23:56.338
Just... Just this song,
all right?

24:00.438 --> 24:01.872
Just please turn it off.

24:05.539 --> 24:07.239
It's one song.

24:13.237 --> 24:15.338
All right, you know what?
Just let me out here.

24:15.971 --> 24:17.937
- Here?
- Yeah, just stop. Just stop.

24:17.939 --> 24:19.439
- I'll get out here.
- Here?

25:08.339 --> 25:09.306
Eh?

25:11.571 --> 25:13.437
You know, rehearsal,

25:13.439 --> 25:14.737
everywhere, everywhere.

25:27.438 --> 25:28.438
I know.

25:31.271 --> 25:33.303
We don't have an audience
at rehearsal.

25:33.305 --> 25:34.969
I am not an audience.

25:34.971 --> 25:37.273
- Guests.
- I'm not a guest.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.770
Really? Did you join the band,
and no one told me?

25:39.772 --> 25:41.439
Ha ha. Funny.

25:42.538 --> 25:44.105
I want to support you.

25:44.838 --> 25:47.006
Why is that
such a tragedy for you?

25:47.972 --> 25:50.470
Tell me, how is the band?

25:50.472 --> 25:51.836
Is everyone okay?

25:51.838 --> 25:53.269
Oh, my God.
I just walked in the door.

25:53.271 --> 25:57.372
Please, please. Just...
Just wait to interrogate me.

26:14.471 --> 26:16.405
We need to... to talk.

26:22.137 --> 26:23.972
How are you feeling?

26:38.938 --> 26:40.372
When did you speak to him?

26:45.004 --> 26:46.171
He said that?

26:53.404 --> 26:56.338
Not sold out and not selling
well are not the same thing.

26:59.571 --> 27:02.071
What you do is so difficult.

27:04.871 --> 27:07.071
So much disappointment.

27:08.105 --> 27:12.273
But you keep going,
and I admire that.

27:12.538 --> 27:13.872
Can you please stop?

27:27.439 --> 27:28.573
Perfect.

28:32.371 --> 28:33.372
Lio.

28:38.439 --> 28:41.005
It was my favorite record
when I was 16.

28:47.738 --> 28:49.072
'Cause I loved it.

28:54.305 --> 28:57.039
Don't talk to me
through a closed door.

30:18.870 --> 30:20.205
Oh, shit.

30:28.237 --> 30:30.739
Oh, shit.

30:45.472 --> 30:47.606
Come on. Come on.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.339
Please, don't be silly.
Don't be silly.

30:51.770 --> 30:52.771
Hmm?

31:12.671 --> 31:13.605
<i>Allez.</i>

31:15.038 --> 31:18.269
- Have you seen a brown paper bag?
- <i>Non.</i>

31:18.271 --> 31:20.602
Brown paper bag with handles?

31:20.604 --> 31:21.839
- What?
- You know, with handles?

31:25.771 --> 31:26.673
Shit.

31:27.372 --> 31:30.706
Shit. I've lost
the dress that I bought.

31:47.504 --> 31:49.306
- Yes?
- <i>Hi. Um...</i>

31:49.871 --> 31:52.503
<i>You were my Lyft driver
earlier this afternoon,</i>

31:52.505 --> 31:55.969
<i>and I think I left
a shopping bag in your...</i>

31:55.971 --> 31:57.139
<i>in the back seat.</i>

31:58.471 --> 32:00.903
<i>A brown bag. A
paper bag with handles?</i>

32:00.905 --> 32:03.573
- <i>Clothes or something?</i>
- Yeah. A dress.

32:04.204 --> 32:05.336
I have it.

32:05.338 --> 32:07.170
<i>You do!</i>

32:07.172 --> 32:08.239
<i>Where are you?</i>

32:08.505 --> 32:10.169
Oh, I'm at 49th
between 2nd and 3rd,

32:10.171 --> 32:13.205
but I can meet you somewhere
else if that's easier for you.

32:14.838 --> 32:15.838
<i>I'm not far.</i>

32:16.372 --> 32:17.872
I'll pay you for your time.

32:18.171 --> 32:19.506
I didn't ask that.

32:20.404 --> 32:21.671
Give me a couple minutes.

32:22.205 --> 32:23.339
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:18.104 --> 33:20.071
Hello. I have to go.

33:20.339 --> 33:21.339
I'm on the phone.

33:21.905 --> 33:23.768
No, I can see that,
but I have to go.

33:23.770 --> 33:25.838
- Where?
- To find my dress.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.570
Just a second.
My daughter's here.

33:28.572 --> 33:31.638
I'm just going to... I'll talk
to you later, okay? Okay.

33:32.405 --> 33:35.338
Well, that was Enzio.

33:35.737 --> 33:36.802
Who?

33:36.804 --> 33:37.769
Enzio.

33:37.771 --> 33:39.573
I told you about him,
the Italian.

33:40.405 --> 33:43.003
Oh. I... I can't keep track.

33:43.005 --> 33:45.972
We had this passionate weekend,

33:46.272 --> 33:47.772
sex every minute,

33:47.971 --> 33:50.872
and the next weekend,
uh, he's unavailable.

33:51.271 --> 33:52.768
I don't need to commit,

33:52.770 --> 33:55.671
but I don't want to be
humiliated, either.

33:57.272 --> 34:00.736
Uh-huh.
Anyway, um, I'll be back.

34:00.738 --> 34:01.839
When?

34:02.770 --> 34:06.604
I don't know.
I have to retrace my steps.

34:07.104 --> 34:08.302
Well, I'll come with you.

34:08.304 --> 34:09.536
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

34:14.005 --> 34:16.268
When does your sound check
start tomorrow?

34:16.271 --> 34:18.303
- Why?
- I want to come.

34:18.304 --> 34:19.902
I want to see
your preparation.

34:19.905 --> 34:20.804
Um...

34:21.338 --> 34:22.505
I'll...

34:23.638 --> 34:25.904
I'll... I'll see you.

34:32.705 --> 34:34.070
Yeah, it's... it's easy.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.373
Go, go, go, go!

34:38.670 --> 34:40.338
You're in for it now.

34:45.871 --> 34:46.835
I'm sorry.

34:46.838 --> 34:48.473
- Hello.
- <i>Ms. Carala?</i>

34:48.804 --> 34:50.636
I'm calling to confirm
your appointment

34:50.638 --> 34:53.337
with Dr. Holt
for tomorrow at 8 a.m.

34:53.339 --> 34:54.371
Oh.

34:54.670 --> 34:57.172
Um, yes, it...
I'm confirmed.

34:57.438 --> 34:59.235
<i>Nothing but
water after midnight,</i>

34:59.237 --> 35:00.836
<i>and you should bring
someone with you.</i>

35:00.838 --> 35:02.437
<i>It's a lot of information.</i>

35:02.439 --> 35:03.772
Okay.

35:04.205 --> 35:06.103
<i>One of the tests
involves mild anesthesia,</i>

35:06.105 --> 35:08.336
<i>so whoever's with you
must sign you out.</i>

35:08.338 --> 35:09.505
Okay.

35:10.072 --> 35:11.337
<i>See you in the morning.</i>

35:11.339 --> 35:12.905
Okay. Thank you.

35:13.738 --> 35:15.872
Oh, God.

35:22.272 --> 35:23.372
Hi!

35:25.071 --> 35:25.938
Hi.

35:26.371 --> 35:27.370
One second.

35:27.372 --> 35:28.705
Uh, it's in the back seat.

35:29.205 --> 35:30.039
Oh.

35:33.537 --> 35:35.436
Ah.

35:35.438 --> 35:36.704
Thank you.

35:40.871 --> 35:41.804
Okay.

35:47.071 --> 35:49.103
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, wait!

35:49.105 --> 35:51.106
Hey, hey! Wait.

35:53.937 --> 35:54.704
Sorry.

35:55.038 --> 35:56.205
Yeah, one second.

35:56.538 --> 35:58.372
Sorry.
Since you're here, can I, um...

35:59.072 --> 36:00.239
can I get a ride?

36:00.805 --> 36:02.903
Uh, I can't.
I'm on the phone.

36:02.905 --> 36:05.238
Oh, it's fine.
It's not far. I don't mind.

36:05.503 --> 36:10.638
I'm not asking your permission to
talk on my phone in my own car.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.936
I'm not taking you,

36:12.938 --> 36:14.936
because I'm having an
important phone conversation,

36:14.938 --> 36:18.072
and I don't want anybody
in the car while I'm on it.

36:21.971 --> 36:22.939
Okay.

36:53.338 --> 36:54.370
Hey, Viv.

36:54.372 --> 36:55.505
Hey, Joey. How are you?

36:55.937 --> 36:57.636
They know you're coming,
or you want me to call up?

36:57.638 --> 36:59.006
Yeah, they know I'm coming.

36:59.305 --> 37:00.839
Okay, thanks.

37:29.970 --> 37:30.969
Hey.

37:30.971 --> 37:31.839
Hey.

37:33.971 --> 37:36.206
You said you'd text
when you were on your way.

37:37.471 --> 37:38.705
Didn't I?

37:39.570 --> 37:40.669
No, you didn't.

37:40.671 --> 37:42.239
- I thought I did.
- Come in.

37:43.838 --> 37:46.039
Had I known,
I would have made more food.

37:46.271 --> 37:47.405
Oh, that's okay.

37:47.771 --> 37:49.502
She should be home soon.

37:49.504 --> 37:53.039
She doesn't usually get home
until about 7:00 on a Thursday.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.239
Yeah, I know. Practice.

37:57.571 --> 37:58.738
I know that.

37:59.238 --> 38:00.172
Yeah.

38:02.304 --> 38:04.904
Do you want something?
A drink or...

38:05.371 --> 38:07.338
Uh... yeah.

38:07.838 --> 38:10.672
I guess just some water
is good. Thanks.

38:11.204 --> 38:12.171
Okay.

38:13.304 --> 38:14.704
Nice skirt.

38:15.538 --> 38:17.705
It's the same one
you always like.

38:21.471 --> 38:24.202
So is this just a stop-by,
or should I make more food?

38:24.204 --> 38:27.071
No. I just wanted to talk to you
before she got home.

38:27.704 --> 38:31.205
Right.
Okay, well, that's good...

38:33.104 --> 38:35.605
because I've been meaning
to talk to you, too.

38:36.604 --> 38:38.739
Yeah, your tour dates,
are they firm?

38:40.303 --> 38:41.404
Um...

38:41.871 --> 38:43.635
Well, there's sort of a...

38:43.637 --> 38:45.871
they're still sort of shifting.

38:46.438 --> 38:48.072
- Right.
- Why?

38:48.570 --> 38:50.336
Well, she got
her recital dates,

38:50.338 --> 38:53.835
and based on the dates that I
have, you're gonna be gone.

38:53.837 --> 38:55.469
And she's upset?

38:55.471 --> 38:57.735
Well, she didn't say
she was upset, but, uh...

38:57.737 --> 38:59.804
- She's upset.
- She's fine.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.905
She's kind of used to it.

39:05.403 --> 39:07.070
Well, what do you
want me to do?

39:07.072 --> 39:09.572
I don't want you
to do anything, Viv.

39:11.005 --> 39:12.968
I just... I know that she'd
love you to be there.

39:12.970 --> 39:14.972
I just want you
to know that.

39:17.737 --> 39:19.035
Well...

39:19.037 --> 39:21.804
maybe I could move the dates,
some dates.

39:22.204 --> 39:24.835
Okay. Just please
don't promise anything

39:24.837 --> 39:26.604
unless it's a done deal.

39:27.437 --> 39:28.605
I wouldn't.

39:31.270 --> 39:32.436
I mean, honestly,

39:32.438 --> 39:35.272
the whole tour in general
is in question now.

39:37.271 --> 39:38.305
Why?

39:40.770 --> 39:41.871
I...

39:44.837 --> 39:46.337
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:46.938 --> 39:48.172
Hey, your mom's here.

39:50.704 --> 39:53.371
Hello, Sweets.
How was practice?

39:53.804 --> 39:55.136
I didn't know you'd be here.

39:55.138 --> 39:57.139
Oh, yeah.
I just thought I'd drop by.

39:58.805 --> 40:02.639
Hey, <i>Grand-mère</i> is in town
for my shows.

40:02.837 --> 40:05.204
I know. She called me,
like, seven times today.

40:05.638 --> 40:06.839
She wants to see you.

40:07.203 --> 40:09.038
Yeah, I want to see her, too.

40:09.303 --> 40:10.904
More than you do, I bet.

40:18.203 --> 40:19.237
So?

40:20.072 --> 40:22.672
So why don't I come back
after she's sleeping?

40:23.204 --> 40:24.371
Maybe tomorrow.

40:26.538 --> 40:27.839
Or I'll just...

40:34.338 --> 40:37.170
What's-a
matter with the spaghetti?

40:40.904 --> 40:42.235
Well, I'll let you guys eat.

40:42.237 --> 40:43.836
Come on, Viv.

40:43.838 --> 40:45.335
- Can we just eat once?
- No, no, no. Honestly,

40:45.337 --> 40:47.335
- I'm... 'Cause I...
- Just eat with us.

40:47.337 --> 40:50.071
No, no, no, 'cause I got stuff.
I'll see you later, okay?

40:51.371 --> 40:52.372
Okay.

40:59.071 --> 41:01.368
Don't take any of it personally.
She's just...

41:01.370 --> 41:03.134
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

41:03.136 --> 41:04.904
- It's fine.
- We'll talk later. Okay?

41:05.471 --> 41:06.772
You okay?

41:08.604 --> 41:10.905
Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm okay.

41:30.537 --> 41:31.871
Oh, shit.

42:58.704 --> 43:01.404
I saw a whale here once.

43:08.005 --> 43:09.472
Right there...

43:11.371 --> 43:12.471
swimming.

43:13.838 --> 43:15.372
Big as a truck.

43:20.338 --> 43:22.338
You don't believe me, do you?

43:51.771 --> 43:54.272
Hey. Can you meet me?

43:54.871 --> 43:56.101
Now.

43:56.103 --> 43:57.868
Um, yeah. Where?

43:57.870 --> 43:59.134
The usual.

43:59.136 --> 44:00.471
Nice or dive?

44:00.938 --> 44:01.839
<i>Nice.</i>

44:02.303 --> 44:03.703
Okay. See you there.

44:03.705 --> 44:04.872
Okay.

46:23.403 --> 46:24.337
Hi.

46:24.705 --> 46:25.705
Yes.

46:26.036 --> 46:27.736
Um, can I have
the vanilla, please?

46:27.738 --> 46:29.902
No, no, actually could...
could I have the coffee?

46:29.904 --> 46:32.336
No, no. The strawberry.

46:32.338 --> 46:34.202
Actually, I'm just gonna stick
with the vanilla.

46:34.204 --> 46:35.235
Just vanilla. How much?

46:35.237 --> 46:37.038
- One dollar.
- Okay.

46:37.870 --> 46:39.204
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46:40.270 --> 46:41.438
Thank you.

46:53.869 --> 46:55.768
No, I know!

46:55.770 --> 46:57.903
Take two Saturdays
and two Sundays, so...

46:58.804 --> 47:00.301
- Does that count?
- So five days' notice.

47:00.303 --> 47:01.935
I don't know if it counts.

47:01.937 --> 47:03.037
Viv!

47:03.804 --> 47:05.105
Vivienne.

47:05.570 --> 47:08.001
- Hi, Tessa.
- Oh, my God!

47:08.003 --> 47:09.234
Wow. It's been ages.

47:09.236 --> 47:10.967
- How are you?
- Good. I'm good.

47:10.969 --> 47:12.169
- You look great.
- You, too.

47:12.171 --> 47:13.335
Are you heading somewhere?

47:13.337 --> 47:14.671
Oh, I was just...

47:15.004 --> 47:16.738
Well, then, come join us.

47:17.503 --> 47:20.069
I would love to,
but I have a thing.

47:20.071 --> 47:21.302
Well, just a drink, then.

47:21.304 --> 47:23.238
You have to join us.
It's her birthday.

47:24.237 --> 47:25.902
That's right.
It is your birthday today.

47:25.904 --> 47:28.168
Yes, so I make the rules.

47:28.170 --> 47:29.967
- Okay.
- One drink?

47:29.969 --> 47:30.967
One drink.

47:30.969 --> 47:33.071
Come. It's Viv.

47:35.570 --> 47:37.235
- Can't believe it.
- I know.

47:37.237 --> 47:39.438
Everyone,
this is my friend Vivienne.

47:39.737 --> 47:40.669
Viv, everyone.

47:40.671 --> 47:41.868
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:41.870 --> 47:42.867
- Hey.
- Hi.

47:42.869 --> 47:43.934
Sorry. Hey.

47:43.936 --> 47:46.868
Is this... Did I...

47:46.870 --> 47:48.702
- Okay.
- Chablis?

47:48.704 --> 47:50.770
Oh. Sure. Thanks.

47:53.270 --> 47:54.967
- Thanks.
- We just finished,

47:54.969 --> 47:56.269
but if you want something,

47:56.271 --> 47:57.536
the waiter was just
about to come over...

47:57.538 --> 47:59.501
Oh, no, that's okay.
I'm good.

47:59.503 --> 48:01.505
All right.
As long as you're good.

48:02.870 --> 48:05.202
Hey, Viv, you remember
my husband Hugo.

48:05.204 --> 48:06.968
Of course. Yeah. Hi.

48:06.970 --> 48:08.702
- Nice to see you.
- Hi.

48:08.704 --> 48:10.671
Let's, um... Let's...

48:17.703 --> 48:18.702
Hi.

48:18.704 --> 48:20.205
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:20.736 --> 48:22.404
Oh, my God.
Please catch me up.

48:22.970 --> 48:24.801
I am always at home
with the five-and-under set.

48:24.803 --> 48:27.737
I have no idea what's happened
in the last five years.

48:28.237 --> 48:29.536
You have more than one now?

48:29.538 --> 48:30.472
Three.

48:31.071 --> 48:32.568
- Wow.
- I know.

48:32.570 --> 48:34.669
We're crazy.
One, three, and five.

48:34.671 --> 48:35.503
Congratulations.

48:35.837 --> 48:38.238
Well, this is why
we never see each other.

48:38.836 --> 48:40.138
I've missed you.

48:40.903 --> 48:42.302
I have missed you.

48:42.304 --> 48:43.502
Yeah.

48:43.504 --> 48:46.034
But what I've heard,
it's incredible.

48:46.036 --> 48:48.602
Oh. Thank you.

48:48.604 --> 48:50.738
Thanks, yeah.
Still an uphill battle.

48:51.071 --> 48:52.668
Well, sure, but, I mean,

48:52.670 --> 48:55.505
getting to perform
and see the world,

48:55.904 --> 48:59.338
I can't even imagine
how amazing it must be.

48:59.670 --> 49:00.771
Yeah.

49:02.136 --> 49:03.104
Oh.

49:03.604 --> 49:05.504
I heard you were engaged.

49:06.904 --> 49:08.338
Well, uh...

49:09.437 --> 49:12.237
I... I was engaged.

49:14.071 --> 49:16.438
Was engaged, yeah.

49:18.004 --> 49:19.401
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

49:19.403 --> 49:20.868
I'm really sorry.
I didn't know.

49:20.870 --> 49:22.436
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's fine.

49:22.438 --> 49:23.871
It's fine. I'm fine.

49:25.270 --> 49:26.770
Well, how's Lucie?

49:27.869 --> 49:28.802
She's good.

49:28.804 --> 49:31.204
She's what?
She's, like, 12 now?

49:32.303 --> 49:33.538
She's 16.

49:34.270 --> 49:35.870
Sixteen?

49:37.204 --> 49:38.469
- No.
- Yes.

49:38.471 --> 49:40.405
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

49:41.303 --> 49:45.569
Wow.
Well, so is she with you now,

49:45.571 --> 49:48.368
or is she still with...

49:48.370 --> 49:49.870
With her dad. Yeah.

49:50.071 --> 49:53.205
- Mmm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

49:53.904 --> 49:55.205
'Cause of my schedule.

49:55.937 --> 49:57.971
No, of course. I mean...

49:58.903 --> 49:59.902
Oh.

49:59.904 --> 50:01.838
Does anybody
have a cigarette for me?

50:02.904 --> 50:03.938
Thank you.

50:04.304 --> 50:06.638
- Oh, come with me.
- Okay.

50:24.137 --> 50:25.738
Yeah, I gotta get out of here.

50:27.170 --> 50:28.937
- Thank you.
- Later.

50:31.770 --> 50:34.435
Honestly,
it's a shit show at home,

50:34.437 --> 50:36.968
and I have no time
to do anything.

50:36.970 --> 50:39.967
I mean,
my fricking career, right?

50:39.969 --> 50:42.504
You know? My life...

50:43.936 --> 50:45.034
Yeah.

50:45.036 --> 50:46.304
Oh, there'll be time.

50:46.603 --> 50:48.871
In a few years, I guess.

50:49.538 --> 50:51.770
That's what I keep
telling myself, anyway.

50:52.171 --> 50:53.638
There's time, right?

50:54.471 --> 50:56.469
- Yeah. There's time.
- For sure.

51:00.503 --> 51:02.005
Sorry.

51:09.204 --> 51:10.638
Who's that?

51:11.137 --> 51:12.138
Why?

51:12.637 --> 51:14.502
The look on your face.

51:14.504 --> 51:15.904
Who sent you that?

51:17.171 --> 51:19.069
It's my drummer.

51:19.071 --> 51:20.868
You're fucking your drummer?

51:20.870 --> 51:21.968
No.

51:21.970 --> 51:24.038
Yes, you are.

51:24.503 --> 51:26.337
Okay. Yes, I am.

51:26.969 --> 51:29.336
Please tell me you're going
over to his place right now.

51:29.338 --> 51:34.335
No. He's... He's playing with
this singer I really like, so...

51:34.337 --> 51:36.101
- Oh.
- I said I'd drop by.

51:36.103 --> 51:37.338
- Oh.
- Tessa.

51:38.204 --> 51:39.537
It's time for cake.

51:43.503 --> 51:44.902
- Sorry.
- Go, go, go.

51:44.904 --> 51:46.768
- No, no, no. Go.
- It was so great to see you.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.169
- Really good.
- Really good.

51:48.171 --> 51:49.269
Really good to see you.

51:49.271 --> 51:50.704
- Have a great night.
- Okay.

51:51.670 --> 51:53.704
Thank you very much.

51:54.503 --> 51:57.037
Well, um, so...

51:59.104 --> 52:00.835
let's get together
again soon, okay?

52:00.837 --> 52:02.138
Just like old times.

52:03.304 --> 52:04.934
- Bye.
- Happy birthday.

No, no, no, no, no.
I can't. I can't.

59:12.037 --> 59:13.803
I have an early morning. I...

59:17.170 --> 59:18.104
Really.

Okay.

01:01:34.002 --> 01:01:35.103
Hey.

01:01:36.469 --> 01:01:37.403
Hi.

01:01:40.369 --> 01:01:41.336
Hi.

01:01:41.602 --> 01:01:42.670
Um...

01:01:44.603 --> 01:01:46.034
I think we met earlier.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.603
You rescued my dress.

01:01:48.102 --> 01:01:50.336
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:01:52.303 --> 01:01:55.004
It's a... It's a coincidence.

01:01:55.869 --> 01:01:56.936
In New York?

01:01:57.269 --> 01:02:00.701
Nah. Mm-mmm.
Happens all the time.

01:02:00.703 --> 01:02:01.838
Yeah. It does.

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:06.504
<i>Django Reinhardt
here on Soft Jazz 77.</i>

01:02:08.602 --> 01:02:09.670
You get to go home soon?

01:02:13.302 --> 01:02:14.537
If I want to.

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:18.737
My wife and I
had a fight earlier.

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:22.370
I love her, but, uh,
you know how it is.

01:02:23.803 --> 01:02:25.004
Yeah.

01:02:37.902 --> 01:02:39.137
Amazing.

01:02:41.169 --> 01:02:42.470
All this...

01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:45.236
and his hand
was half paralyzed.

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:54.704
One of the greatest
to ever live.

01:02:58.103 --> 01:03:02.070
First a tragedy, then a miracle.

01:03:12.903 --> 01:03:14.768
I'd like to change
the destination

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:17.504
or, you know,
the address where I'm going.

01:04:17.169 --> 01:04:19.169
I won't be long.
Would you wait?

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.236
I would pay you
for the time, of course.

01:04:23.603 --> 01:04:27.271
People say they won't be long,
but they're always long.

01:04:28.769 --> 01:04:30.837
Well, how much 'til 8 a.m.?

01:04:31.935 --> 01:04:33.370
Oh. Uh...

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:40.337
I could do, uh, 65 an hour.

01:04:41.936 --> 01:04:43.170
Okay.

01:04:44.637 --> 01:04:45.670
Okay.

01:04:47.935 --> 01:04:49.137
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:59.702 --> 01:05:00.802
Hey, Liev.

01:05:01.437 --> 01:05:02.604
Should I call?

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:04.638
No. They're expecting me.

01:05:05.803 --> 01:05:06.836
Thank you.

01:05:56.902 --> 01:05:58.070
It's the middle of the night.

01:05:58.503 --> 01:05:59.901
I told you
I was coming back.

01:05:59.903 --> 01:06:02.270
Yeah, but come on.
It's the middle of the night.

01:06:02.936 --> 01:06:04.268
Gosh. Can I come in?

01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:06.201
- Yes. Just be quiet.
- I'm sorry.

01:06:06.203 --> 01:06:07.535
I didn't realize
it was so late.

01:06:07.537 --> 01:06:10.400
Yeah. You can't
just keep doing this.

01:06:10.402 --> 01:06:11.633
- You can't just keep...
- What?

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:13.303
dropping by
whenever you feel like it.

01:06:13.802 --> 01:06:15.534
Well, I don't think
that's very fair.

01:06:15.536 --> 01:06:17.700
I'm trying to create some kind
of stability here for her,

01:06:17.702 --> 01:06:19.236
and you just keep fucking it up.

01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:22.033
- Yeah, okay, I hear you.
- All right, do you?

01:06:22.035 --> 01:06:23.701
- Yes, I hear you.
- Do you, really?

01:06:23.703 --> 01:06:24.870
Oh. Okay.

01:06:26.103 --> 01:06:27.471
- Hi, honey.
- Mom?

01:06:28.536 --> 01:06:30.036
I'm too tired for this.

01:06:30.603 --> 01:06:32.034
I'm just gonna say
good night to her.

01:06:32.036 --> 01:06:33.404
Yeah. It's more important.

01:06:33.869 --> 01:06:34.803
Thank you.

01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:37.936
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:38.902 --> 01:06:40.234
Did I wake you up?

01:06:40.236 --> 01:06:41.603
Nah. I couldn't sleep.

01:06:44.337 --> 01:06:45.670
What are you doing?

01:06:48.803 --> 01:06:51.603
Here. Listen.

01:07:01.469 --> 01:07:02.470
Okay.

Is that you?

01:07:31.668 --> 01:07:34.836
Yeah, me and Alex.
We've been making some stuff.

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:37.603
I like it a lot.

01:07:38.702 --> 01:07:39.937
Yeah?

01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:42.170
A lot.

01:07:54.169 --> 01:07:56.003
- You left that.
- Hmm?

01:07:59.036 --> 01:08:00.370
I did.

01:08:01.235 --> 01:08:02.702
I looked at it.

01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:05.471
Do you like it?

01:08:06.003 --> 01:08:07.504
It's gorgeous.

01:08:08.503 --> 01:08:10.371
Is it for one of your shows?

01:08:13.803 --> 01:08:14.837
What?

01:08:16.002 --> 01:08:17.304
Nothing.

01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:19.036
You're freaking me out.

01:08:19.703 --> 01:08:22.037
What?
How am I freaking you out?

01:08:22.536 --> 01:08:24.834
You just look, like,
really sad and serious.

01:08:24.836 --> 01:08:27.336
Did the tour get longer
or something?

01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:30.670
No. No, no, no.
Everything's good.

01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:37.036
Looks like the... some of the tour
might get canceled, actually.

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:38.603
Why?

01:08:40.536 --> 01:08:43.566
I'm just...

01:08:43.568 --> 01:08:46.836
I'm just...
I'm over it, touring.

01:08:47.868 --> 01:08:49.502
You love touring.

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:06.703
That's for you.

01:09:07.468 --> 01:09:08.800
On loan?

01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:09.701
No.

01:09:12.768 --> 01:09:14.702
You didn't get this for me.

01:09:15.203 --> 01:09:16.569
It's yours.

01:09:19.969 --> 01:09:21.368
I... I love it.

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:22.803
Thank you.

01:09:28.469 --> 01:09:31.569
You should...
You should go to bed.

01:09:35.734 --> 01:09:37.069
You should go to sleep.

01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:39.736
I will if you will.

01:09:43.468 --> 01:09:45.435
You coming to my show
this weekend?

01:09:46.234 --> 01:09:47.502
Yeah, Saturday.

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:50.401
With <i>Grand-mère.</i>
Didn't she tell you?

01:09:50.403 --> 01:09:52.136
No, but good.

01:09:52.803 --> 01:09:55.233
She was pissed
you ditched her tonight.

01:09:55.235 --> 01:09:56.669
She called you?

01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:58.936
Of course she called me.

01:10:01.269 --> 01:10:02.602
Glad you'll be there.

01:10:03.435 --> 01:10:04.769
I wouldn't miss it.

01:10:08.369 --> 01:10:09.669
I've missed...

01:10:15.035 --> 01:10:16.169
so much.

01:10:20.035 --> 01:10:21.003
It's fine.

01:10:21.435 --> 01:10:22.833
I like you so much more

01:10:22.835 --> 01:10:25.435
than a lot of my friends
like their moms right now.

01:10:30.003 --> 01:10:31.037
Night.

01:10:34.035 --> 01:10:35.003
Good night.

01:10:35.469 --> 01:10:36.637
Night.

01:10:55.336 --> 01:10:56.966
You and your French movies.

01:10:56.968 --> 01:10:59.503
Well, there's a reason
I was interested in you.

01:11:01.203 --> 01:11:03.769
You were just in love
with my mother, that's why.

01:11:05.535 --> 01:11:06.936
What was I thinking?

01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:10.603
Seriously.

01:11:36.836 --> 01:11:38.170
What are you doing?

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.969
What's going on with you, Viv?

01:12:03.368 --> 01:12:07.636
The... The little pain
in my head...

01:12:08.868 --> 01:12:10.203
did I tell you about that?

01:12:11.968 --> 01:12:15.636
Ye... yeah.
Well, a long time ago.

01:12:17.402 --> 01:12:18.903
Is there something wrong?

01:12:21.735 --> 01:12:22.836
Yeah.

01:12:28.069 --> 01:12:29.137
Is it serious?

01:12:30.269 --> 01:12:31.470
Maybe, they think.

01:12:32.236 --> 01:12:34.669
I have to have some more tests
tomorrow morning.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:38.567
You just... You just now
got it looked at?

01:12:38.569 --> 01:12:39.570
Just you...

01:12:40.235 --> 01:12:43.070
You've had that pain
in your head for a long time.

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.600
I know. I've just...
I've been so busy...

01:12:46.602 --> 01:12:48.703
Jesus, Viv, why...

01:12:50.768 --> 01:12:52.267
why don't you ever
take care of this shit?

01:12:52.269 --> 01:12:55.870
I mean, the...
the really important shit.

01:12:58.002 --> 01:13:00.500
It's not just about you, Viv.

01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:02.167
It hasn't been for a long time.

01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:04.600
- Yeah. I know that.
- It's not just about you.

01:13:04.602 --> 01:13:05.966
Okay, stop. Stop.

01:13:05.968 --> 01:13:08.103
Just back off
for a fucking second, okay?

01:13:16.336 --> 01:13:18.037
If it is serious...

01:13:20.668 --> 01:13:22.567
you have to tell me
before you tell Lucie

01:13:22.569 --> 01:13:25.636
so that we can figure out
how we're gonna tell her.

01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:27.335
Okay?

01:13:35.401 --> 01:13:37.836
I should go get some sleep.

01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:43.170
I'm sorry.

01:13:45.802 --> 01:13:47.034
It's not that I don't care.

01:13:47.036 --> 01:13:49.837
Of course I fucking care.
It's just...

01:13:56.536 --> 01:14:00.901
I'm gonna go look in on her
for a second before I go.

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.236
Okay.

01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:10.637
Hi.

01:19:11.802 --> 01:19:13.669
I... Sorry it's so early.

01:19:19.901 --> 01:19:21.470
Uh, no.

01:19:23.702 --> 01:19:25.168
No, I'm not.

01:19:32.736 --> 01:19:34.003
Okay.

01:20:47.234 --> 01:20:49.402
Where to?

01:20:49.935 --> 01:20:52.236
Um, 68th and York.

01:20:54.168 --> 01:20:55.636
The hospital there?

01:20:58.235 --> 01:20:59.403
Yeah.

01:21:30.468 --> 01:21:32.103
Did you get much sleep?

01:21:33.834 --> 01:21:34.769
No.

01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:38.270
- Did you?
- No.

01:21:52.168 --> 01:21:53.469
We're here.

01:22:05.302 --> 01:22:06.869
Can we stop for coffee?

01:22:09.069 --> 01:22:10.302
Sure.

01:22:36.168 --> 01:22:37.334
Coffee?

01:22:37.336 --> 01:22:39.033
Uh, yeah. Thank you.

01:22:39.035 --> 01:22:42.336
Hi. Let me get a
coffee and a tea, please.

01:22:42.867 --> 01:22:44.168
Sure thing.

01:22:50.269 --> 01:22:52.370
Oh, I just remembered
I can't drink this.

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:55.736
That's all right.

01:22:56.034 --> 01:22:58.469
I'll hold it for you
for later.

01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:19.936
I'm okay from here.

01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:22.635
You sure?

01:23:23.001 --> 01:23:24.066
Yeah.

01:23:24.068 --> 01:23:25.335
I'm sure.
