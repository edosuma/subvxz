Saranac Lake is a
beautiful spot in New York.

01:23.704 --> 01:29.284
They refer to it as the
greener side of The Big Apple.

01:29.509 --> 01:31.042

01:31.043 --> 01:33.878
It's a great place to live.

is these beautiful homes.

01:36.721 --> 01:40.561
That just appear out of nowhere.

01:44.640 --> 01:50.487
What I had actually decided to do is
start a business... property development.

01:50.488 --> 01:56.388
There was one old home that caught
my eye that sat up on a hill.

02:02.041 --> 02:07.941
I looked at it, and I'm like,
wow. This is just incredible.

02:08.548 --> 02:11.788
It was bigger than big.

02:15.755 --> 02:21.655
What particularly attracted me was
the fact that it needed some work.

02:25.064 --> 02:28.634
It was a diamond in the rough.

02:28.635 --> 02:32.171
I made some inquiries, and
I purchased the property.

I wasn't gonna waste any time.

02:42.982 --> 02:47.962
The building was already
divided into apartments.

02:48.254 --> 02:52.732
What I was gonna do is remodel each
apartment one by one, move new people in.

A lot of these homes
were built in the 1900s.

There was a lot that needed to be done.

03:07.580 --> 03:13.345
Right on the first floor immediately,
there were five apartments.

03:13.346 --> 03:19.246
Then you go up the staircase,
and there's three more up there.

03:19.619 --> 03:23.255
On the third floor
was another apartment.

03:23.256 --> 03:28.896
It was all locked up, which
I thought was a little odd.

03:34.115 --> 03:38.135
That third floor was full of junk.

03:39.905 --> 03:41.917
That was the breath-taker.

03:41.918 --> 03:45.578
That was gonna be a big job.

03:46.119 --> 03:50.499
That'd be the one that would kill you.

that one till last.

And cut my expenses was to
live in one of my apartments.

04:20.779 --> 04:25.760
So that's why I chose
to live in apartment G.

I left my door open because I figured,

06:42.828 --> 06:45.257
well, if somebody's out there,
if somebody's playing games...

06:45.258 --> 06:49.638

to do a load of laundry.

were right next to the staircase.

[Loud bang]

08:37.302 --> 08:39.881

08:43.042 --> 08:48.942

I open the closet door or not?

08:56.365 --> 09:00.325

progress. We're moving forward.

10:25.896 --> 10:29.432
I had one person call me
who was very interested.

10:29.433 --> 10:31.563
Her name was Cynthia.

10:31.564 --> 10:36.572
She was exactly the kind of
tenant that I was looking for.

10:36.573 --> 10:40.043
She was a professional.
She was in real estate.

10:40.044 --> 10:41.244
Wow.

10:41.245 --> 10:44.314
Seeing the apartment for the
first time, it was amazing.

10:44.315 --> 10:48.371

like this even available for rent at all.

architecture, it was just phenomenal.

10:52.430 --> 10:56.485
It was completely private and
wooded and just really exquisite.

10:56.486 --> 10:58.228
- It's great.
- Yeah.

10:58.229 --> 11:01.685
Is there anything else
that I should know?

In the beginning, I never told
anybody about what was going on.

11:07.738 --> 11:10.306
I wasn't sure what I was seeing.

found out, why say anything

11:12.858 --> 11:18.078
to anybody else until I
have a logical explanation?

11:18.515 --> 11:20.516
No, I don't think so.

11:20.517 --> 11:22.218
All right, can I show
you the greenhouse?

11:22.219 --> 11:23.586
- Yeah.
- Come on.

11:23.587 --> 11:25.255
I took the apartment straightaway.

11:25.256 --> 11:27.390
I really liked Mike. I
loved the architecture.

11:27.391 --> 11:30.751

11:42.559 --> 11:48.459

dog, Buddy, would come with me.

11:53.817 --> 11:56.397

12:15.201 --> 12:17.181

little creepier to me.

13:00.289 --> 13:02.190

son's father at the time,

13:04.861 --> 13:06.427

So I decided to find a place
on my own for myself and Ashton.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.968
It had a big yard.

13:13.969 --> 13:19.272
Behind the house was woods. I know
my son likes to play in the woods.

13:19.273 --> 13:23.353
It seemed like a safe, quiet place.

Was Matthew there? Is he back?

13:30.619 --> 13:32.195
- Yeah.
- Is he feeling better now?

13:32.196 --> 13:33.859
- Yeah.
- Good.

Four months later, Ashton and
I were sitting in the kitchen.

this chill in the room for a moment.

There's no one here.

of air on the back of his neck.

ran up to the third floor.

14:56.364 --> 14:58.740
You know, it was pretty routine by now.

14:58.741 --> 15:00.538
I'd let him stay up there,

15:00.539 --> 15:05.725
I'd get my laundry done, and at
the end, I'd go and get my dog.

[Grunts]

34:14.120 --> 34:16.088
Something had attacked me.

34:16.089 --> 34:18.248
[Gasping]

34:21.110 --> 34:23.224
Your nose is bleeding.

34:23.225 --> 34:25.385
[Gasping]

34:26.933 --> 34:28.496
[Gasps]

34:28.496 --> 34:31.837
She completely disappears
and runs outside.

34:31.838 --> 34:35.018
[Tense orchestral music]

34:36.842 --> 34:40.512
I just wanted to get
the heck out of there.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.514
[Tires skidding]

34:42.514 --> 34:45.155
[Engine roaring]

34:45.985 --> 34:50.489
All of a sudden, I see
something in the road.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.726
We saw this figure.

34:52.728 --> 34:54.760
It was, like, darker than dark.

34:54.761 --> 34:55.754
Mike.

34:55.755 --> 34:59.031
It came faster at the car.

34:59.032 --> 35:00.986
- [Tires skidding]
- [Screams]

35:00.987 --> 35:02.043
Woo!

35:02.044 --> 35:03.565
[Tires screech]

35:03.566 --> 35:05.726
[Screams]

35:06.672 --> 35:10.512
It just disappeared, into midair.

35:11.111 --> 35:12.477
[Gasping]

35:12.478 --> 35:13.645
You're still in denial.

35:13.646 --> 35:19.546
You don't want to admit that anything
like this could ever happen to you.

35:22.289 --> 35:27.394
Before this had happened with the road,
all the experiences that I have had...

35:27.395 --> 35:31.964
And other people have had
was right at the property.

35:31.965 --> 35:33.880
Now, all of a sudden,

35:33.881 --> 35:39.781
whatever it was was angry, and it
followed us a mile from the house.

35:42.578 --> 35:45.246
I had had enough.

35:45.247 --> 35:47.680
It was attacking me. That's one thing.

35:47.681 --> 35:53.581
But when it's attacking my
girlfriend, I needed to take action.

35:53.923 --> 35:56.563
[Engine revving]

35:58.561 --> 36:01.201
[Birds chirping]

36:04.260 --> 36:10.160
There was one person that I thought
would actually be able to help...

36:12.835 --> 36:15.955
A good friend, Cheryl.

36:16.339 --> 36:21.319
Cheryl's a very deep,
spiritual type of person.

36:21.744 --> 36:27.644
For me to confide in Cheryl and for her
to listen to me, it was a big relief.

36:30.487 --> 36:33.655
I got all the things that you asked for.

36:33.656 --> 36:38.193
She proposed to do a
blessing of the house.

36:38.194 --> 36:43.499
I felt really good about that because
nobody had recommended that to me.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.600
[Match strikes]

36:44.601 --> 36:48.567
She set out white candles for
peace to let whatever it was there

36:48.568 --> 36:54.468
know that we weren't there to
harm anybody or do anything bad.

36:57.349 --> 37:01.609
She goes, "you've got something here".

37:02.352 --> 37:05.013
She had her book with her, her Bible.

37:05.014 --> 37:09.525
And she opened it, and she
looked at me, and, um...

37:09.526 --> 37:13.595
[Voice breaking] She says,
we're gonna take care of this.

37:13.596 --> 37:17.874
And I just looked at her, and I just
didn't know what to think, because I knew.

37:17.875 --> 37:20.443
I knew there was something there.

37:20.444 --> 37:24.073
When I am afraid, I will...
[voice distorting] Trust in you.

37:24.074 --> 37:26.074
She started praying and stuff.

37:26.075 --> 37:27.976
In God, whose word I praise.

37:27.977 --> 37:30.111
[Distorted] God, whose word I praise.

37:30.112 --> 37:33.815
She started hearing
sounds, whispering sounds.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.450
[Indistinct whispering]

37:35.451 --> 37:38.320
And she's like, Mike, this isn't good.

37:38.321 --> 37:41.223
[Distorted] I shall not be afraid.

37:41.224 --> 37:43.223
[Whooshing]

37:43.224 --> 37:45.924
So do not fear.

37:46.493 --> 37:47.979
For I am with you.

37:47.980 --> 37:51.400
[Whispering] For I am with you.

37:51.401 --> 37:54.203
- I will uphold you...
- [Whispering] I will uphold you...

37:54.204 --> 37:56.672
With my righteous right hand.

37:56.673 --> 37:59.553
[Whispering] Hand...

38:02.579 --> 38:05.914
Behold... [discordant music hit]

38:05.915 --> 38:07.816
And then she got attacked.

38:07.817 --> 38:10.485
[Ominous ambient music]

38:10.486 --> 38:14.089
All of a sudden, she
started feeling sick.

38:14.090 --> 38:15.971
Cheryl. Cheryl, are you okay?

38:15.972 --> 38:17.853
- She just puked.
- [Retching]

38:17.854 --> 38:19.981
[Indistinct whispering]

38:19.982 --> 38:24.037
To see something bad happen to somebody
that you've known for a long time...

38:24.038 --> 38:24.908
Cheryl, what's wrong?

38:24.909 --> 38:29.879
To see them get attacked by something
that you can't explain is crazy.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.100
[Retching]

38:35.816 --> 38:37.856
[Music]

38:41.367 --> 38:43.047
_.

38:43.239 --> 38:46.059
So do not fear...

38:48.526 --> 38:50.809
- Cheryl. Cheryl, are you okay?
- [Retching]

38:50.810 --> 38:52.490
_.

38:52.615 --> 38:53.625
Cheryl!

38:53.626 --> 38:55.484
People just don't understand.

38:55.485 --> 38:56.956
- Cheryl, what's wrong?
- [Retching]

38:56.957 --> 39:02.717
There's some stuff in this
world that's just so, so bad.

39:04.353 --> 39:06.573
[Coughing]

39:07.034 --> 39:11.040
I grabbed the holy water and
went on her back with a cross.

39:11.041 --> 39:12.100
[Gasping]

39:12.101 --> 39:15.424
All of a sudden, I did that,
and, like, everything stopped.

39:15.425 --> 39:18.365
Everything was fine.

39:25.911 --> 39:28.431
[Serene music]

39:35.177 --> 39:39.171
After that, everything was just good.

39:39.172 --> 39:42.532
Everything seemed peaceful.

39:45.946 --> 39:49.782
But there's... something's
been bothering me.

39:49.783 --> 39:54.053
I wanted to know about
the building's past.

39:54.054 --> 39:57.714
I needed to get more answers.

40:04.331 --> 40:07.894
What I had decided to do
is head to the town records,

40:07.895 --> 40:13.535
and see what I can actually
find out about the property.

40:16.443 --> 40:20.665
Back in the 1900s, a lot of people
from the cities came to Saranac Lake,

40:20.666 --> 40:23.253
for the fresh air to cure Tuberculosis.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.934
_.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.224
Doctors and nurses
bought these big mansions.

40:30.225 --> 40:34.365
And turned them into a cure cottage.

40:36.363 --> 40:39.963
These homes had huge porches.

40:40.867 --> 40:42.402
They'd wheel them out onto the porch.

40:42.403 --> 40:45.278
They'd put them out there
for, like, fresh air treatment,

40:45.279 --> 40:49.305
with the hope that they could
cure themselves of Tuberculosis.

40:49.306 --> 40:54.226
And they could go back
home to their families.

40:54.615 --> 40:57.555
Hundreds were cured.

40:59.266 --> 41:03.046
Thousands died from the disease.

41:03.724 --> 41:07.739
There were records of people
being admitted for T.B.

41:07.740 --> 41:09.962
In my house.

41:09.963 --> 41:15.063
My house was referred to
as the Williams Cottage.

41:16.041 --> 41:20.541
There were names of
men, women, children.

41:24.778 --> 41:28.688
It was actually all
starting to come together.

41:28.689 --> 41:31.976
There was a lot of people that had
come through the Williams Cottage...

41:31.977 --> 41:35.037
That had passed away.

41:35.598 --> 41:39.916
They didn't want the role
of the house to be forgotten.

41:39.917 --> 41:45.817
This is why they were angry, and doing what
they were doing during the renovations.

41:45.907 --> 41:49.424
They didn't want me to change the
building away from what it was.

41:49.425 --> 41:53.685
They wanted to have it stay that way.

42:02.331 --> 42:08.231
We decided to keep a part of the
house unchanged, up on the third floor.

42:08.358 --> 42:12.051
Just one little piece of the house...

42:12.052 --> 42:16.792
That they have, that
nobody will ever touch.

42:17.420 --> 42:22.820
It was going to be like my
"peace offering" to them.

42:24.006 --> 42:26.466
[Door closes]

42:26.486 --> 42:32.386
Since I've dedicated that spot,
things have calmed down a lot.

42:32.512 --> 42:37.043
I don't feel that the
spirits are evil, anymore.

42:37.044 --> 42:42.944
And I realize that this is what
they wanted everybody to know.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.243
_.

42:50.471 --> 42:53.046
