WEBVTT

00:55.905 --> 01:00.076
America first fell in love with
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison...

01:00.284 --> 01:05.248
...in the box-office smash
Autumn with Greg and Peg.

01:05.456 --> 01:08.459
They had the most celebrated marriage
in Hollywood.

01:10.670 --> 01:13.840
Who could forget
how they hit one out of the park...

01:14.006 --> 01:16.217
...in Requiem for an Outfielder?

01:16.384 --> 01:20.054
You can't die, Mike. You can't.

01:20.555 --> 01:22.557
Because I love you.

01:26.352 --> 01:29.063
Justice never tasted so sweet...

01:29.313 --> 01:31.149
...as in The Bench.

01:32.525 --> 01:36.612
I didn't do it. I'm innocent.
Why won't anyone believe me?

01:36.821 --> 01:39.365
-I object, Your Honour!
-You're out of order!

01:39.490 --> 01:41.200
No, you are out of order sir!

01:41.284 --> 01:44.495
I object to the way
my client has been treated.

01:44.954 --> 01:48.124
I object to the fact that I've let
my professional judgment...

01:48.332 --> 01:51.043
...become clouded by my feelings
for my client.

01:51.294 --> 01:55.131
I object to the way the room seems to spin
whenever she walks into it.

01:55.381 --> 01:59.135
I object, Your Honour,
because I love this woman.

01:59.677 --> 02:01.888
Their love opened our eyes...

02:02.096 --> 02:04.724
...in Sasha and the Optometrist.

02:04.974 --> 02:07.268
Read from the top line, Sasha.

02:10.395 --> 02:11.731
"l...

02:12.190 --> 02:16.694
"...L-O-V-E...

02:16.861 --> 02:19.530
"...Y-O...."

02:20.490 --> 02:21.657
Oh.

02:21.949 --> 02:23.201
You.

02:23.868 --> 02:25.453
Dr. Martin!

02:25.661 --> 02:29.248
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison:

02:29.540 --> 02:32.543
America's Sweethearts.

02:38.883 --> 02:41.886
God, they were great. Made my job cake.

02:42.053 --> 02:46.432
I did the press for all their movies, all nine.
Six did over $100 million.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.143
They were on top of the world.

02:49.393 --> 02:52.230
Then she blew it
by taking up with that Spaniard.

02:52.313 --> 02:55.108
-Did you cut this yourself?
-No, Chad in marketing--

02:55.191 --> 02:58.861
Always take credit.
That is survival rule number one.

02:59.070 --> 03:00.780
Okay, I did it on my Mac.

03:00.863 --> 03:05.410
Rule number two: Don't take credit
until someone actually says they like what you did.

03:06.077 --> 03:07.328
It's not bad.

03:10.289 --> 03:12.667
I hope this isn't too awkward for you.

03:12.834 --> 03:15.461
-I'll never be able to fill your shoes.
-I know.

03:16.796 --> 03:21.551
Kingman's in the screening room and he
wants you to look at something right now.

03:22.593 --> 03:26.097
Please remind Mr. Kingman
that he fired me last week.

03:26.347 --> 03:29.934
Then invite him, at his earliest
convenience, to kiss my undercarriage.

03:30.017 --> 03:32.103
I think you'll wanna see this Lee.

03:37.859 --> 03:40.069
-Hello, Dave.
-Lee.

03:40.695 --> 03:42.822
-Thank you for coming.
-Why am I here?

03:42.947 --> 03:47.160
I'm just confused. I mean, you did actually fire me
last week, so why am I here?

03:47.660 --> 03:49.871
I brought you to see the new Weidmann film.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.080
-Really?
-Yes.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.708
Eddie and Gwen's last movie.
You know their movies better than anybody

03:53.791 --> 03:56.419
Have you seen it? All of it? How is it?

03:56.961 --> 03:58.421
Could you roll that, please.

03:59.297 --> 04:03.551
I want you to be the first to see
what only I have seen. As a friend.

04:30.369 --> 04:31.746
Something wrong?

04:32.330 --> 04:34.999
-Did the film break?
-No.

04:35.333 --> 04:38.836
The film is fine.
I think it's fine, wherever it is.

04:39.670 --> 04:43.257
I spent 86 million dollars...

04:43.382 --> 04:45.218
...of the studio's money...

04:45.343 --> 04:46.928
...on 20 seconds...

04:47.512 --> 04:48.763
...of titles.

04:51.099 --> 04:53.184
That's all he sent me. The titles!

04:54.310 --> 04:55.478
And a note.

04:57.772 --> 05:00.691
"Dave, we could also do these in blue."

05:03.194 --> 05:07.782
-We had to make a Hal Weidmann picture!
-He's won three Oscars. He's a genius.

05:07.907 --> 05:11.411
There's only been one genius
in this business: SeÃ±or Wences!

05:11.577 --> 05:15.415
A little lipstick, some hair and his hand!
He had an career for 85 years!

05:15.706 --> 05:17.333
Do you remember?

05:17.708 --> 05:21.045
"S'all right! S'all right!"
Don't talk to me about genius.

05:21.379 --> 05:24.257
-Remember the crazy guy in the woods?
-Ted Kaczynski.

05:24.340 --> 05:26.217
-Who? The guy at Fox?
-The Unabomber.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.011
The Unabomber.
Remember he lived in that little cabin?

05:29.095 --> 05:30.179
So?

05:30.263 --> 05:34.016
Hal Weidmann bought that cabin
from the government...

05:34.267 --> 05:36.644
...and had it moved onto his property.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.564
That is where he edits his movies.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.984
That is his little, twisted...

05:43.234 --> 05:45.445
...sicko office.

05:45.737 --> 05:47.447
It's him. On the phone.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.241
-Who?
-Hal.

05:50.575 --> 05:54.078
I'm going to kill him!
That sick, son-of-a-bitch bastard.

05:54.746 --> 05:56.330
Put him on the speaker.

05:56.414 --> 05:57.415
Hi, Hal.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.169
How are you, darling?

06:01.252 --> 06:05.089
I've been thinking about you.
I wanted to send you a basket or something.

06:05.256 --> 06:06.507
How's the movie?

06:06.591 --> 06:09.385
-It's finding its way.
-Could it find its way to the studio?

06:09.552 --> 06:12.555
We have a few little things to do with it,
like finish it.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.682
It's finished, Dave.

06:16.768 --> 06:18.603
Great. How is it?

06:18.686 --> 06:21.439
My mother thinks
it's the best thing I've ever done.

06:21.773 --> 06:24.150
-Can I speak with her, Hal?
-No, Dave.

06:24.442 --> 06:27.153
-Can we send someone to pick it up?
-No, Dave.

06:27.236 --> 06:29.447
You haven't said anything about the titles.

06:29.781 --> 06:31.991
I love them. I have no notes.

06:32.283 --> 06:33.659
When's the press junket?

06:34.911 --> 06:36.454
Weekend of the 21st. Why?

06:36.954 --> 06:38.956
'cos I want the press to be first to see it.

06:39.624 --> 06:42.752
I'll bring it to the junket.
We'll all experience it together.

06:42.835 --> 06:47.632
Hal, no. I'm the head of the studio.
I don't experience things with the press.

06:47.965 --> 06:49.133
I'm hanging up now.

06:49.467 --> 06:51.677
Wait! Give me that. Hello?

06:52.136 --> 06:53.137
No, no.

06:53.971 --> 06:55.139
God...

06:55.473 --> 06:56.641
...damn it!

07:04.649 --> 07:06.776
He won't let us see it before the press!

07:06.859 --> 07:09.320
-At the junket?
-Yes, at the junket!

07:12.824 --> 07:14.492
-No, no.
-Lee.

07:15.284 --> 07:17.036
You've got to do this junket.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.706
You want me to set up a junket in 2 weeks,
and you're not sure if you have the film.

07:20.832 --> 07:21.833
-Yes.
-No!

07:25.962 --> 07:27.130
Lee!

07:30.508 --> 07:32.176
Don't make me beg.

07:32.635 --> 07:34.679
-You already are.
-Lee, please.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.014
Please, come on. Lee?

07:38.599 --> 07:40.726
-Danny can handle it.
-No, Lee.

07:40.893 --> 07:44.397
Danny cannot handle it.
It's his first junket.

07:44.564 --> 07:48.401
I need the master. When working
with the press, you're a legend.

07:48.693 --> 07:50.695
I prefer to remain a living legend.

07:50.778 --> 07:53.406
If you won't do it for me,
do it for my father.

07:53.489 --> 07:56.576
You worked together a long time.
You had a real bond.

07:56.784 --> 07:58.494
Your father was a psychotic.

07:58.578 --> 08:01.873
-You spoke at his funeral.
-I loved him. You, I can't stand.

08:01.956 --> 08:04.250
Do this for me. Please.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.879
The studio will go under.
I haven't had a hit in almost two years!

08:07.962 --> 08:12.341
I have the last Eddie and Gwen movie ever made
and I can't get my hands on it!

08:19.682 --> 08:22.560
Tell me what you want.
I'll tell you what I want.

08:22.643 --> 08:24.145
I want only one thing.

08:24.228 --> 08:27.732
If people think Eddie and Gwen
are back together, they'll see the movie.

08:27.857 --> 08:30.067
-Make that happen.
-That'll be easy.

08:30.193 --> 08:32.570
Just make it look like it could happen.

08:32.779 --> 08:36.032
She has a restraining order against him,
and he flipped out.

08:36.115 --> 08:38.241
He's living in some nut hut
in the mountains.

08:38.326 --> 08:43.121
I don't care! I need Eddie and Gwen
back together again, smiling and happy!

08:44.499 --> 08:46.876
-We can sell the shit out of it.
-And the Spaniard?

08:47.001 --> 08:50.505
Unless I get a script called
I Schtupped Castro, I don't know.

08:52.048 --> 08:53.633
So, what do you want?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.384
I want the golf cart.

08:55.468 --> 08:58.137
-No, it was a gift from Arnold.
-I'm kidding.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.642
-I can have anything?
-Yeah. Within reason.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.770
I want my job back.

09:05.853 --> 09:09.524
-Don't do this to me--
-Have a great junket. Tell me how it went.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.193
All right. Yes.

09:13.986 --> 09:17.824
If you get Eddie and Gwen back together,
you can have your job back.

09:18.783 --> 09:21.160
-Where are we booked?
-Four Seasons, Beverly Hills.

09:21.244 --> 09:24.288
Cancel. We need to get these people
in the middle of nowhere.

09:24.372 --> 09:26.749
Once they know there's no movie,
they can't escape.

09:26.874 --> 09:29.585
We need a hotel like the one
in The Shining. Isolated.

09:29.669 --> 09:33.256
The new Hyatt in Nevada?
It's in the desert, and it's just opening.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.759
Book it. We have to keep
the press entertained and on the go.

09:36.884 --> 09:40.721
The best junkets are when the press thinks
it's not about the movie, but them.

09:40.847 --> 09:44.767
Program the shit out of them:
Cocktail parties, hayrides, circle jerks.

09:44.892 --> 09:48.729
Keep them from remembering they
haven't seen the movie they're to review.

09:48.813 --> 09:49.897
What about gifts?

09:50.022 --> 09:53.693
The movie's about a cop
who travels through time, so I did a gun.

09:54.235 --> 09:57.238
-You're giving press members a gun?
-It's not real.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.741
We'll do a really nice bag.
Call the bag man.

09:59.824 --> 10:02.660
Diamond earrings for the ladies,
money clips for the men.

10:02.744 --> 10:04.829
Chocolate truffles, the best perfume.

10:04.912 --> 10:07.665
I don't want this to be awkward for you...

10:07.749 --> 10:09.667
...but I've got some work to do.

10:10.084 --> 10:14.088
-How will you get Eddie and Gwen there?
-Don't worry. I know somebody.

10:14.380 --> 10:18.634
I love you. I'd do anything for you.
You're just asking an awful lot.

10:18.843 --> 10:21.763
A junket with Eddie
isn't high on Gwen's list of priorities.

10:21.846 --> 10:23.598
No lilies. Take them out.

10:23.765 --> 10:25.892
Yes. I understand.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.187
Yes. Excuse me, hold on.
Could you please put that out?

10:29.270 --> 10:32.940
-This is perfect for Gwen.
-I can't accept unsolicited material.

10:33.232 --> 10:37.612
Just warning you it'll be a bit of a fight.
I'll do what I can.

10:37.779 --> 10:39.155
God help us.

10:40.239 --> 10:43.284
Commercial break. When we come back,
you know the scenario.

10:43.367 --> 10:44.744
I've been here before Larry.

10:44.827 --> 10:47.580
When the tape rolls,
look right at that camera.

10:47.663 --> 10:49.415
Talk right to the caller.

10:49.499 --> 10:52.043
-Right down the tube.
-Okay, five seconds.

10:54.879 --> 10:57.090
Let's go to phone calls on Larry King Live.

10:57.215 --> 10:59.967
White Plains, you're on the air
with Gwen Harrison.

11:00.051 --> 11:01.052
Hi, Larry.

11:01.135 --> 11:05.139
Gwen, hi. I used to be a big fan...

11:05.431 --> 11:09.811
...but I'm sorry, I can't get over what
happened with you and Eddie. I'm so sick.

11:09.894 --> 11:12.271
I can't sleep at night. How can you?

11:12.355 --> 11:13.731
Well....

11:13.981 --> 11:17.902
You sleep next to a very handsome
young Spanish gentleman, don't you?

11:19.904 --> 11:23.574
Let's go to our next call.
Rock lsland, Illinois. Hello.

11:24.075 --> 11:26.285
Hi Larry. Gwen, I saw your latest movie.

11:26.828 --> 11:27.912
Thank you.

11:27.995 --> 11:32.208
I couldn't sit through it.
I can't watch you without Eddie, it's not the same.

11:32.291 --> 11:36.212
This has to be hard to hear. Your last
two movies, ones without Eddie...

11:36.337 --> 11:38.798
...crashed and burned at the box office.

11:39.257 --> 11:43.302
They were very big in Europe
and huge in Japan, actually.

11:43.386 --> 11:46.514
It's got to be tough.
Two unsuccessful movies in a row.

11:46.597 --> 11:49.350
Lots of intrigue, lots of whispers,
lots of talk.

11:49.434 --> 11:51.978
What happens if this one tanks?

11:53.271 --> 11:57.191
I hate Larry King.
Why did I do his stupid show?

11:57.275 --> 11:59.485
-Just breathe.
-I don't want to breathe.

11:59.610 --> 12:02.071
"Your last two movies
crashed and burned."

12:02.155 --> 12:06.367
I wanted to choke him to death
with those stupid suspenders.

12:07.034 --> 12:09.120
-Everyone hates me.
-No one hates you.

12:09.203 --> 12:13.207
The lighting was great.
You looked great. Everybody said so.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.752
-Who?
-You looked great.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.504
Thanks. As if she really knows.

12:18.713 --> 12:21.549
Have a sip of water.
It'll make you feel better.

12:21.716 --> 12:25.219
Is this the one with the electrolytes?
I only like that water.

12:27.138 --> 12:30.099
-Larry said you were amazing.
-Thank you.

12:30.308 --> 12:32.059
I love Larry.

12:32.226 --> 12:34.687
Let's love him down to the dressing room.

12:41.235 --> 12:42.945
-Black or white?
-White.

12:43.654 --> 12:47.241
And those glasses.
Who wears frames that big anymore?

12:47.492 --> 12:49.368
He looks like a bug.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.997
I just want this week to be over.

12:53.498 --> 12:57.668
Why can't the world accept the fact
I don't want to be with Eddie anymore?

12:57.752 --> 13:00.630
I just want to scream at people,
"Get a life!"

13:02.090 --> 13:05.301
-I want this week to be over. Is it?
-Almost. Push.

13:08.596 --> 13:09.764
I'm sorry.

13:12.016 --> 13:14.769
I smell smoke. Is somebody smoking?

13:16.187 --> 13:18.564
-I don't know.
-It's probably Larry.

13:18.856 --> 13:22.777
-How many heart attacks has he had?
-Six? Maybe seven?

13:22.944 --> 13:26.197
Can we just go?
I don't want to be here anymore.

13:27.365 --> 13:29.450
-Those are beautiful.
-Okay.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.828
I got a call from Lee today.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.872
-Who's Lee?
-The studio's publicist. You remember.

13:34.956 --> 13:36.749
-I do?
-Remember were you were doing Letterman?

13:36.874 --> 13:40.461
You got upset when they bumped your
show off the air due to the Gulf War.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.047
He was there.
He got you that English toffee.

13:43.131 --> 13:45.425
I remember the English toffee. Great toffee.

13:45.633 --> 13:50.596
We'll get you some when you meet
with him to talk about the junket.

13:50.888 --> 13:55.309
-Oh, God. Do I have to?
-Meet with him? Yes, you have to.

13:55.476 --> 13:59.564
It's not fair. All this pressure on me
and none whatsoever on Eddie.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.441
He's probably having the time of his life.

14:02.525 --> 14:05.653
This letter is a very important part
of the healing process.

14:05.737 --> 14:09.157
Writing to your mother,
you have the opportunity to thank her...

14:09.282 --> 14:13.286
...or forgive her or ask her why she did
the things she did.

14:13.745 --> 14:15.163
Don't mail the letter.

14:15.246 --> 14:18.166
The simple act of putting it on paper
frees you...

14:18.416 --> 14:20.209
...allows you to let go.

14:20.418 --> 14:23.337
Now, what did you say to your mother?

14:26.090 --> 14:27.633
"Dear Mom:

14:27.842 --> 14:29.093
"Fuck you."

14:29.302 --> 14:32.805
Okay. We'll try the letter some other time.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.517
Are you comfortable
speaking about Gwen?

14:37.393 --> 14:39.687
-Do you think I should?
-There is no "should."

14:39.771 --> 14:42.231
-Do you think I can?
-What is "can"?

14:44.108 --> 14:45.276
All right.

14:49.447 --> 14:50.990
There was this place in Chinatown.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.535
Tiny little place.

14:55.787 --> 14:57.997
We'd go there and they wouldn't bother us.

14:58.206 --> 15:02.543
We'd order wonton soup and crumpled
duck and sit there for hours, talking.

15:03.586 --> 15:05.088
She took him there.

15:07.423 --> 15:09.550
She took him to our crumpled duck.

15:15.098 --> 15:19.393
I followed them and I saw him
pouring the soup and smiling....

15:35.034 --> 15:37.078
It was a total accident.

15:37.245 --> 15:42.625
Next thing, she told the press I tried to kill
her. That's crazy. She loves to overreact.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.132
We have a saying, Edward.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.510
"Mecka lecka halava beem sala beem."

15:52.718 --> 15:54.595
What is that? Bean salad?

15:57.140 --> 15:58.683
What does that mean?

15:59.434 --> 16:02.061
I don't know what it means. It's very old.

16:07.775 --> 16:10.528
I feel like I'm making progress.
I feel more secure.

16:10.611 --> 16:12.822
A lot more secure.
Do I seem more secure?

16:13.906 --> 16:17.577
You look great. Whatever the doctors
are doing, it's working.

16:17.785 --> 16:20.329
You got colour in your face. I'm in love.

16:20.538 --> 16:23.291
They say two weeks here
changes your entire life.

16:23.374 --> 16:25.918
-When are two weeks up?
-Six and a half months ago.

16:26.043 --> 16:28.171
I feel I'm getting close to something.

16:28.296 --> 16:30.590
I can see that.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.718
Did you watch Larry King last night?

16:33.801 --> 16:36.471
I was in the isolation tank. No TV in there.

16:36.637 --> 16:39.932
The reason I bring it up is Gwen was on.

16:42.351 --> 16:43.936
She took kind of a beating.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.688
She did, did she?

16:46.481 --> 16:49.317
You, young lady,
are nobody without Eddie!

16:49.525 --> 16:51.319
Nobody likes you!

16:51.527 --> 16:54.947
Never, never go anywhere without Eddie.
You're nothing.

16:55.198 --> 16:56.657
You're nothing!

16:56.824 --> 16:59.118
Get her out of here. Now! Nothing!

16:59.452 --> 17:00.787
I'm so sorry, Larry.

17:02.413 --> 17:04.540
I guess she got what she deserved.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.127
Why are you doing here? This isn't you.

17:08.336 --> 17:11.089
Kiss Gandhi goodbye
and get ready for the junket.

17:11.172 --> 17:13.549
I won't go! I'm not ready.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.926
The studio and the movie need you.

17:16.010 --> 17:19.347
I don't care about the studio or the movie.
How is it? ls it good?

17:19.597 --> 17:23.101
I've only seen a bit in the beginning.
It's fantastic.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.770
Hold it up to your ear,
you'll scream "Oscar."

17:25.895 --> 17:27.771
-I'm telling you.
-No, I'm not going.

17:27.855 --> 17:29.273
Gwen will be there.

17:30.066 --> 17:31.609
You want to see her?

17:31.692 --> 17:34.695
-No. It's too soon.
-It's a year and a half.

17:34.904 --> 17:38.825
Confront her. Get it over with.
She fell in love with another guy.

17:39.575 --> 17:40.743
It happens.

17:40.827 --> 17:45.039
Never to me, but if it did, I wouldn't
spend my life hiding like some pussy!

17:45.248 --> 17:48.251
I'm not a pussy.
I'm in the middle of my treatment.

17:48.501 --> 17:52.171
This is serious stuff.
My wellness guide won't let me just go.

17:53.714 --> 17:55.133
-You can go.
-Are you sure?

17:55.216 --> 17:59.470
Two nights ago you said I was the flower that fell into the
stream, but a branch is blocking my way.

17:59.554 --> 18:00.471
Do you take that back?

18:00.555 --> 18:04.058
You read too much into what I say.
Don't listen to my words, listen to your own heart.

18:04.350 --> 18:08.479
-I'm the flower. I don't want to go.
-You're a funny man. We'll miss you here.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.733
-Don't forget to be grateful.
-I'm grateful.

18:11.941 --> 18:15.528
I'm grateful for the sun,
for the stars in the sky.

18:15.778 --> 18:18.239
I'd be grateful if we could get going.

18:20.283 --> 18:23.035
-Why don't you wait in the car?
-Okay.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.248
I am the flower.

18:29.459 --> 18:31.085
I'm the flower.

18:31.294 --> 18:34.046
-He kills me with his humour.
-Does he?

18:35.423 --> 18:38.509
Listen, chief, I want to thank you
for all your help.

18:38.593 --> 18:41.053
-You'll get the car within 10 days.
-Convertible.

18:41.137 --> 18:44.724
Convertible, leather interior, fully loaded.
You'll enjoy it.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.685
He'll get through this okay, right?

18:50.605 --> 18:52.106
Life is a cookie.

18:54.817 --> 18:56.611
I'll take that as a "yes."

18:57.028 --> 18:58.988
Okay. All right.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.490
Come on, Eddie!

19:02.283 --> 19:03.659
All right, buddy.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.370
Ready to go? Here we go.

19:09.832 --> 19:12.960
-Does Gwen know I'm going to the junket?
-It was her idea.

19:13.169 --> 19:15.254
Absolutely. She's really excited.

19:16.380 --> 19:20.051
Not in a million years.
If that demented pig is there, no way.

19:20.468 --> 19:24.138
-Eddie was just temporarily insane.
-Don't stick up for him.

19:24.514 --> 19:26.432
-Kiki, look at you.
-Hi, Lee.

19:27.225 --> 19:29.018
-How are you?
-Good.

19:29.102 --> 19:30.895
-You look fabulous.
-Thank you.

19:30.978 --> 19:33.106
What did you do? ls it your hair?

19:33.314 --> 19:35.358
It's my hair, and a little sun.

19:35.858 --> 19:37.485
She lost 60 pounds.

19:39.737 --> 19:41.823
And I lost a little weight.

19:42.031 --> 19:45.034
I see that. You look terrific.

19:45.201 --> 19:46.619
Sixty pounds.

19:47.286 --> 19:49.747
-That's a Backstreet Boy.
-Right.

19:49.872 --> 19:51.749
Are you here to talk to me?

19:52.041 --> 19:55.253
Of course. I'm sorry. Eddie is not demented.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.506
It was a one-time incident,
a forgive-and-forget thing.

19:58.631 --> 20:02.760
He tried to kill me Lee.
Am I the only person who remembers that?

20:02.969 --> 20:06.180
Attempted murder
doesn't get people's attention anymore?

20:08.850 --> 20:12.437
He was just so in love with you
that he flipped out.

20:12.728 --> 20:15.565
You know you have this powerful effect
on people.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.443
That's true.
Are you sticking up for him again?

20:19.902 --> 20:21.738
-Whose side am I on?
-Mine.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.492
Your dog just swallowed
your window washer.

20:26.701 --> 20:27.702
Puppy.

20:28.244 --> 20:31.122
Your puppy, it's a raptor.

20:31.539 --> 20:33.458
Time for Prozac. Excuse me.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.793
-She's on Prozac?
-If only. The dog.

20:35.877 --> 20:38.880
Oh, the dog. That's not a bad thing.

20:38.963 --> 20:39.714
-Hey, baby.
-Hi, honey.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.134
Here comes your sweaty big man.

20:43.593 --> 20:45.720
-You're sweaty.
-Who is this?

20:45.928 --> 20:49.098
Hi, I'm Lee Phillips,
press agent for Time Over Time.

20:49.265 --> 20:53.352
-I'm not here to sweep her off her feet.
-No, no. You're too old.

20:54.729 --> 20:56.439
Hector, honey.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.357
Be good.

20:58.566 --> 21:00.276
I'm sorry. He's Spanish.

21:00.651 --> 21:03.029
No problem. I was Spanish once myself.

21:03.112 --> 21:04.906
Oh, I need kisses.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.245
Oh, honey.

21:12.288 --> 21:13.998
Oh, there you go.

21:14.290 --> 21:15.750
Oh, yes.

21:18.461 --> 21:20.588
For why is he here now?

21:20.838 --> 21:23.549
He wants me to go to the junket
for the movie.

21:24.509 --> 21:26.469
We could do that. When is it?

21:26.552 --> 21:29.806
Actually, we won't take up
any of your valuable time.

21:30.014 --> 21:33.351
-I'm not invited to the junket?
-I'm sorry, it's the studio's decision.

21:33.559 --> 21:36.979
What do I care what the studio thinks?
I don't give a shit.

21:37.563 --> 21:40.733
I go where Gwen goes.
I'm with Gwen now. We're a couple.

21:40.817 --> 21:43.194
We'll go to the junket together. Okay?

21:44.404 --> 21:45.947
Studio.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.825
You're so beautiful.

21:49.242 --> 21:50.701
I love you so much.

21:50.910 --> 21:54.414
I want to marry you and make something
with both of our skins.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.250
We're not going Hector. Eddie will be there.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.252
We won't go to the junket because of him?

21:59.752 --> 22:01.796
Listen to me. We're going to go...

22:01.879 --> 22:03.798
...and I'll personally protect you...

22:03.881 --> 22:08.344
...in case that psychotic asshole bastard
tries to kill you again.

22:08.511 --> 22:12.432
-We're not going.
-Don't argue with me. We're gonna go.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.769
Everybody wants me to go to this stupid
junket, but nobody cares what I want!

22:16.853 --> 22:18.980
-That's not true.
-Nobody cares!

22:19.272 --> 22:22.692
Don't you know the stress I'm under?
Everybody hates me.

22:22.859 --> 22:26.279
Everyone wants a piece of me.
My therapist's out of the country.

22:26.362 --> 22:29.198
I wasn't nominated
for a Golden Globe this year!

22:29.449 --> 22:31.534
Leave me alone.

22:33.286 --> 22:34.370
Bastards.

22:35.830 --> 22:37.832
Are you pleased with yourself?

22:38.332 --> 22:42.712
I can't even enjoy my shower now,
Mr. Publicist piece of shit.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.590
Gwen is totally nuts.

22:48.009 --> 22:49.635
Cleared the room. Well done.

22:49.719 --> 22:53.639
Talk to your sister. You're the only one
she'll pretend to listen to.

22:55.224 --> 22:56.476
Where is she?

22:56.559 --> 22:57.810
Grazing.

23:14.702 --> 23:15.536
Hi.

23:18.915 --> 23:20.625
Nazi bastard.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.001
I was just kidding.

23:31.886 --> 23:33.888
You need to go to this junket.

23:35.264 --> 23:36.891
-Why not?
-I'm afraid.

23:36.974 --> 23:38.059
Of?

23:38.142 --> 23:41.562
That I'll see Eddie
and he'll be this pathetic mess.

23:42.063 --> 23:45.983
I'll feel guilty. I'm tired of feeling guilty,
I really am.

23:46.442 --> 23:47.443
I know.

23:48.736 --> 23:51.948
I'm always thinking about other people.

23:52.281 --> 23:53.533
I know you are.

23:53.699 --> 23:57.537
It's awful being the person
who cares about other people's feelings.

23:57.745 --> 24:02.083
If they see Eddie down and depressed,
they'll pity him and blame me.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.211
What you're really worried about is you.

24:05.294 --> 24:08.589
Of course. Does everyone hate me, Kiki?

24:11.342 --> 24:13.052
No one hates you.

24:13.261 --> 24:14.429
Yes, they do.

24:14.554 --> 24:18.057
I was in a store the other day.
You know that great store on Melrose?

24:18.141 --> 24:22.603
There was a baby in a stroller
looking up at me and he was judging me.

24:23.020 --> 24:26.315
The whole world is judging me
for what I did to Eddie.

24:28.693 --> 24:31.904
Look, I'll admit...

24:32.113 --> 24:35.867
...the Miss Adorable image
has been called into question recently.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.453
That's one more reason to go to the junket.

24:38.578 --> 24:42.582
Smile nice with Eddie for the weekend,
win back some audience goodwill.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.168
-You think it would help?
-Yes I do.

24:46.127 --> 24:49.255
I could give Eddie the divorce papers.
That's a plus.

24:50.423 --> 24:52.133
Sure you're ready to do that?

24:52.216 --> 24:55.970
I'm sure. Why are you
still questioning me about this?

24:56.220 --> 24:57.680
Because it's Eddie.

24:57.764 --> 25:02.560
He'd sing Yellow Submarine at the top
of his lungs just to make you laugh.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.980
Eddie, who'd save the mango
in his fruit salad for you.

25:06.189 --> 25:09.400
Exactly. Eddie.
You're just a romantic, Kiki.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.819
You know nothing about married life.

25:13.905 --> 25:15.573
You got me there.

25:22.163 --> 25:24.373
I won't be able to get through this
on my own.

25:25.750 --> 25:26.834
Can you help me?

25:26.959 --> 25:28.586
I'll help you.

25:36.177 --> 25:37.720
These are new pants.

25:39.055 --> 25:40.890
Good dog. Get the paper.

25:41.099 --> 25:42.183
Come on.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.393
Come on. Please.

25:44.727 --> 25:45.728
Come on.

25:47.730 --> 25:49.941
-Help.
-Don't let me interrupt.

25:50.191 --> 25:51.567
What happened?

25:51.818 --> 25:55.738
I'm going to go pack her things
because we're going to a junket.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.325
Really? Great! You're a great sister.

25:59.534 --> 26:01.160
I'm a great assistant.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.247
To the left.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.186
These are herbal medications.

27:08.686 --> 27:12.440
You probably read in People,
I was on Zoloft, but this is holistic.

27:12.565 --> 27:15.568
-Sure got a lot of them.
-Just watch the road, please.

27:15.651 --> 27:19.072
Bobby? He wants you to pull over.

27:19.447 --> 27:21.157
This is Kishtonga root.

27:22.158 --> 27:24.911
-Why are we stopping?
-I'm doing what I'm told.

27:27.997 --> 27:29.248
So, how you doing?

27:29.332 --> 27:32.126
-Fine. What have you heard?
-I got to hand it to you.

27:32.210 --> 27:35.963
If my lady left me for another guy,
I'd have a gun down my throat.

27:36.172 --> 27:37.632
I'd get drunk off my ass.

27:37.715 --> 27:40.968
I'd lay on the tracks and wait for a train
to finish me off.

27:41.052 --> 27:43.262
Could we please not talk about that?

27:44.889 --> 27:46.390
You know something?

27:46.849 --> 27:48.684
People say I look like you.

27:49.227 --> 27:52.480
It's not that I look like you.
But it's like I project you.

27:52.563 --> 27:55.858
Like I project the essence of you,
like a you-ness.

27:56.067 --> 27:58.986
-Can you put that partition up?
-Yes, sir, Mr. Thomas.

28:03.991 --> 28:05.868
How you doing, pal? How's it going?

28:06.035 --> 28:09.455
Great. I was just getting a little pep talk
from my driver.

28:09.539 --> 28:14.293
I'm orchestrating the hotel arrival.
Should you pull up first, or Gwen first?

28:14.502 --> 28:19.549
-Where did you come from, man?
-Here. I'm riding with Gwen.

28:20.675 --> 28:22.260
Gwen's back there?

28:22.552 --> 28:25.388
Yes. So do you want
to arrive first or second?

28:26.931 --> 28:29.308
-Second.
-Be right back.

28:37.024 --> 28:38.276
He wants to go second.

28:38.401 --> 28:40.695
-Let him go second.
-He can go second.

28:40.945 --> 28:41.863
Great.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.948
-Wait a minute. He should go first.
-Why?

28:44.031 --> 28:48.161
I don't want to look like his opening act.
I want to go second.

28:48.536 --> 28:49.996
She wants to go second.

28:50.079 --> 28:51.456
Second it is.

28:56.711 --> 29:00.465
-She wants to go second.
-Fine. Let her go second. I don't care.

29:00.965 --> 29:04.469
Let her come behind me.
She'll see the knife she stuck in my back.

29:04.594 --> 29:05.762
Thank you.

29:08.556 --> 29:10.099
Second? We're all set.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.809
-Great.
-Who cares?

29:12.018 --> 29:15.772
-She doesn't care.
-Yes, I do. I'm going first.

29:23.613 --> 29:26.074
I don't care! Why is this an issue?

29:26.324 --> 29:29.452
-I'm just trying--
-I don't care! Let's just go to the hotel!

29:29.535 --> 29:31.162
-You're second.
-I don't care!

29:31.245 --> 29:33.623
-I don't care!
-All right.

29:33.706 --> 29:35.833
-I don't care!
-You're going second.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.170
You're going second.

29:39.504 --> 29:41.631
-I don't care.
-Okay, thank you.

29:46.302 --> 29:47.470
That was easy.

29:49.013 --> 29:52.433
-I don't know why we have to go second.
-Just drive the car!

30:02.402 --> 30:06.155
I'm grateful for the sun.
I'm grateful for the moon.

30:06.406 --> 30:08.533
I'm grateful for the cool...

30:09.325 --> 30:10.952
...cool night breeze.

30:21.796 --> 30:24.715
This is certainly a happy night
for Eddie and Gwen fans.

30:24.924 --> 30:28.678
A year ago, America's Sweethearts
went bust in dramatic fashion.

30:29.846 --> 30:34.016
Here they come now. Hi, Gwen.
You look wonderful tonight.

30:34.183 --> 30:35.601
Can I get a shot?

30:36.519 --> 30:37.687
That's it.

30:51.909 --> 30:53.494
Who's a better lover?

30:55.371 --> 30:57.039
Okay, right this way.

31:00.418 --> 31:02.128
Okay, Eddie, here we go.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.046
-Eddie, you look great.
-Thank you.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.132
What's it like working with Gwen?

31:06.215 --> 31:07.633
I can't remember.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.403
Eddie that was so good. That had to feel good.

31:27.570 --> 31:31.741
It was good we went second. Everybody
loved you. Didn't that feel good?

31:31.991 --> 31:35.578
-What is all this stuff?
-Serenity tea from the Wellness Centre.

31:36.162 --> 31:40.249
I don't know what's in it,
but it gets me really calm, really focused.

31:44.212 --> 31:46.339
I can't do this.

31:47.757 --> 31:49.425
I told you this was a mistake.

31:49.509 --> 31:53.262
She's very close, isn't she?
She's in the next room. I can feel her.

31:53.429 --> 31:56.265
No, she's in a cottage
on the back of the property.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.267
I sensed that. She's real close.

31:58.351 --> 32:01.270
She's not. The cottages are way back
on the property.

32:01.354 --> 32:04.273
It's just so shocking.
You're with somebody and...

32:04.357 --> 32:07.735
...you think you'll spend the rest
of your life with that person....

32:07.819 --> 32:09.946
She gets a cottage, I get a shitty little suite?

32:10.029 --> 32:11.697
-She has an entourage.
-And me?

32:11.781 --> 32:13.032
You have an entourage?

32:13.157 --> 32:15.535
I'm a paranoid schizophrenic.
I'm my own entourage.

32:15.660 --> 32:16.828
I'll move you.

32:16.953 --> 32:21.749
No, it's not important. I'm grateful.
I'm grateful for this suite.

32:22.041 --> 32:25.336
Greatful for the minibar.
The cottages are probably small anyway.

32:25.503 --> 32:27.213
No, actually, they're...

32:27.505 --> 32:28.589
...tiny.

32:28.798 --> 32:30.633
-Small?
-It's ridiculous.

32:30.842 --> 32:32.969
-Good.
-Should I get some room service?

32:33.052 --> 32:37.640
I'll take some herbs, numb out,
have a shower and go to bed by myself.

32:37.849 --> 32:40.059
-You've been fabulous today.
-What did I do?

32:40.184 --> 32:44.230
Showed up. That's enough for me.
Get some rest, I don't want you puffy.

33:37.033 --> 33:39.410
Oh, no.

33:46.584 --> 33:48.086
Jesus.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.390
-Hey, Steve.
-What?

34:01.557 --> 34:04.394
A guy's whacking it
down near cottage number four.

34:08.231 --> 34:10.274
Oh, that's....

34:10.650 --> 34:14.570
That's disgusting.
I do not want to deal with this now.

34:14.821 --> 34:18.574
Every time I get this shift,
there's always some sicko like this.

34:18.741 --> 34:21.284
I can't catch a break around here.

34:25.081 --> 34:27.917
Sir, I'm sure things are different in Los Angeles...

34:28.126 --> 34:31.504
...but here in Nevada, masturbating in public
is a punishable offence.

34:31.587 --> 34:34.757
-Excuse me. I've been in Las Vegas--
-I was not--

34:34.924 --> 34:37.051
We saw you on our cameras Mr Thomas.

34:37.260 --> 34:39.262
I was pulling out the pricker.

34:39.429 --> 34:41.556
Come on, I'm putting out a fire here.

34:41.639 --> 34:44.934
-I fell into a cactus.
-He fell into a cactus.

34:45.351 --> 34:49.856
That's it. Come on. Unless you usually
arrest those who bump into succulents...

34:49.938 --> 34:53.234
...l suggest we go our separate ways
and call it a night.

34:53.317 --> 34:55.987
We still have to fill out a report. We can't--

34:56.195 --> 34:59.365
Listen. I'm not supposed to do this, but....

34:59.991 --> 35:03.745
I have some really beautiful bags
that are exclusive for the press.

35:03.870 --> 35:07.373
Do you have girlfriends, wives?
We have earrings, real diamonds.

35:07.457 --> 35:09.667
Beautiful, very tasty. Very delicate.

35:09.792 --> 35:11.544
I saw the bags.

35:11.961 --> 35:13.045
They're nice.

35:13.129 --> 35:15.214
Very nice. The highest quality.

35:18.801 --> 35:23.014
-I guess we don't have to file a report.
-I didn't do anything, you morons!

35:24.474 --> 35:27.143
Diet pills. Usually he's like a pussycat.

35:27.977 --> 35:29.604
-All right.
-All right?

35:30.146 --> 35:32.065
Thank you, guys. All right.

35:34.484 --> 35:36.319
Fellas, one other thing.

35:36.527 --> 35:39.155
I need the tape from the security camera...

35:39.322 --> 35:42.492
...just in case something gets out, all right?

35:42.992 --> 35:45.453
Danny will go with you to get the tape.

35:48.831 --> 35:51.667
Okay. Thank you, fellas.
Appreciate it a lot.

35:56.172 --> 35:59.175
Rent-a-cops. You got me on the edge.
I could go either way!

35:59.258 --> 36:01.302
What were you doing there?

36:01.385 --> 36:03.846
I just wanted to look at her again.

36:04.013 --> 36:08.351
I saw her standing by the pool
and she looked so fantastic.

36:08.518 --> 36:10.019
I just miss her.

36:10.353 --> 36:14.774
Oh, no. Don't give me that look.
I know that look. That look means trouble.

36:15.024 --> 36:19.529
Listen. Calm down. Let's go to your room,
put you to bed and stay out of trouble.

36:19.695 --> 36:23.116
-I wasn't getting in trouble!
-No, no, no.

36:23.366 --> 36:26.536
-Just whacking off on a cactus.
-I wasn't doing that!

36:27.620 --> 36:29.497
It looks as if Eddie Thomas
may have to change...

36:29.580 --> 36:34.544
...his middle name to "Peeping"
after an incident tonight at the Hyatt Resort.

36:34.877 --> 36:38.131
This tape from hotel security cameras
clearly shows Thomas...

36:38.214 --> 36:42.427
...in the words of one hotel security
guard, "doing himself a big favour"...

36:42.927 --> 36:45.888
...outside the cottage
where the actor's estranged wife is staying.

36:46.097 --> 36:48.725
Oh, my God.

36:51.561 --> 36:53.563
Oh, my God.

36:58.109 --> 36:59.861
Oh, no.

37:00.069 --> 37:01.988
Thomas and company are in town...

37:02.071 --> 37:05.074
...for a press junket
for the new Eddie and Gwen movie.

37:05.158 --> 37:08.578
Sources tell us this latest incident
comes as no surprise...

37:08.745 --> 37:13.958
...given Thomas' delicate mental state
since he split with his wife and co-star.

37:14.250 --> 37:16.002
Any idea what this movie's about?

37:16.085 --> 37:18.171
No. But by the looks of it...

37:18.421 --> 37:21.591
...we're looking at a remake
of Cool Hand Luke.

37:21.758 --> 37:26.512
It was on the news, Lee! He was outside
my cottage doing something not good!

37:26.763 --> 37:29.057
But, Gwen, everybody does it.

37:29.265 --> 37:32.435
I know everyone does it.
That's not the point.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.108
What is going on?

37:39.525 --> 37:41.652
Is he trying to kill me again?

37:41.861 --> 37:44.530
Given the weapon he had in his hand,
I doubt it.

37:44.614 --> 37:47.283
We are luck we're al a Hyatt
People don't kill people at a Hyatt.

37:47.450 --> 37:49.744
Other chains, yes, but the Hyatt, no.

37:50.328 --> 37:51.412
Get some rest.

37:51.537 --> 37:54.707
Somebody has to be beautiful tomorrow.
And I think that somebody is you.

37:55.333 --> 37:56.334
I know.

37:56.793 --> 37:58.044
I have to go.

37:58.628 --> 37:59.796
Good night.

38:02.131 --> 38:06.302
Eddie, I am so pissed off! I have the tape!
They must have had a copy!

38:07.053 --> 38:10.807
Bastards. You know,
everybody's got a price, kid.

38:10.973 --> 38:14.060
Hold on. Just a second.
It's room service. Hold on.

38:23.444 --> 38:26.197
Eddie, hi. No, it's just....
Hold on one second.

38:26.406 --> 38:30.993
Put it over there. That is beluga, right?
Yeah, thanks.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.497
Eddie, we're fine. No, it's all local.
Nothing national.

38:34.664 --> 38:36.874
Plus, they'll issue a retraction tomorrow.

38:36.999 --> 38:39.669
You're fine. Really, there's no damage.

38:39.836 --> 38:41.963
I'm telling you it's just a little blip.

38:42.171 --> 38:44.632
It's what you said. It's in the past.

38:44.841 --> 38:49.637
The beach grass grows towards the sun
in this universe you're grateful for.

38:50.179 --> 38:52.223
You know? Get some rest.

38:52.432 --> 38:56.686
Someone has to look handsome tomorrow,
and I think that someone is you. Okay, Mr. Big Time?

38:57.687 --> 38:59.272
See you in the morning.

38:59.355 --> 39:01.733
-You like Eddie, don't you?
-I love him.

39:02.024 --> 39:04.944
-You leaked the tape.
-Survival rule number three, kid:

39:05.361 --> 39:08.865
You're not here to love anybody.
You're here to promote a movie.

39:08.948 --> 39:10.491
That's it. Period.

39:11.617 --> 39:16.080
You get word your mother died.
Hit by a bus or something.

39:16.289 --> 39:19.375
You go downstairs,
you shed a tear and you say:

39:19.625 --> 39:22.962
"lt's a shame.
She would've loved this movie."

39:34.098 --> 39:37.101
I have to talk to Eddie.
I'm worried about him.

39:38.144 --> 39:40.605
-You do that.
-You go get him for me.

39:40.813 --> 39:43.483
-Me?
-Yes, I have to talk to him tonight.

39:43.649 --> 39:48.613
Otherwise I'll be up all night and I'll look terrible
in the morning. Really puffy.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.658
I don't think....

39:54.494 --> 39:56.496
-I can't.
-Why not?

39:57.163 --> 40:00.666
Because I'm sleeping.
And because I just....

40:01.501 --> 40:05.963
I feel funny getting in the middle of things
with the two of you.

40:06.172 --> 40:08.007
Can't you handle this yourself?

40:08.091 --> 40:11.844
What are you talking about?
I don't handle anything myself.

40:12.095 --> 40:14.931
-Why are you being so difficult?
-I'm not.

40:15.139 --> 40:19.310
I'm only asking for a teensy-weensy favour.
That's all.

40:19.519 --> 40:22.605
Please, Kiki. Please.

40:22.814 --> 40:26.484
Please, please, please, please, Kiki-Kiki-Ki.

40:26.692 --> 40:29.153
Please, Kiki-Ki.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.157
God.

40:33.366 --> 40:34.826
Okay.

40:36.869 --> 40:39.163
Your pillow's better than mine.

40:39.372 --> 40:40.706
Take it.

41:10.194 --> 41:12.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:12.447 --> 41:13.614
How are you?

41:13.698 --> 41:17.368
My marriage is shit and I make
crappy movies. Otherwise, I'm great.

41:17.452 --> 41:19.454
Eddie, I'm sorry.

41:19.662 --> 41:21.789
-Why is she doing this?
-I don't know.

41:21.873 --> 41:25.460
-I like your movies.
-They're shit, come on.

41:25.626 --> 41:27.712
What's going on? Did she say anything?

41:27.795 --> 41:30.923
-What happened?
-I'm shocked. I really am shocked.

41:31.007 --> 41:33.634
-I didn't know anything.
-I know I'm not perfect...

41:33.718 --> 41:35.928
...but I thought we had something.

41:36.220 --> 41:37.972
She wants me to move out.

41:38.181 --> 41:39.348
I know.

41:39.974 --> 41:42.435
He'll sit in my chair,
watch my flat-screen TV...

41:42.560 --> 41:45.104
...walk my dog, sleep in my bed with my....

41:45.354 --> 41:48.191
-It's okay.
-I don't know what happened.

41:49.317 --> 41:50.818
Well, it's not you.

41:52.153 --> 41:55.656
You're a great guy,
and if she can't see that, she's blind.

41:56.657 --> 41:59.285
-You are wonderful.
-I don't feel wonderful.

41:59.702 --> 42:00.953
It'll be okay.

42:02.997 --> 42:04.582
I don't think so.

42:06.626 --> 42:08.461
But thanks for saying that.

42:09.504 --> 42:11.881
Thanks for coming. You're really sweet.

42:11.964 --> 42:13.132
No, you are.

42:13.216 --> 42:16.427
No, you are. You're a good friend.

42:22.141 --> 42:23.309
You're a rock.

42:44.414 --> 42:45.665
Hi.

42:47.834 --> 42:50.044
-Come here.
-Nice to see you.

42:50.336 --> 42:51.587
You, too.

42:52.422 --> 42:55.049
-You look good.
-Misery agrees with me.

42:55.258 --> 42:57.176
-You look good, too.
-Thank you.

42:57.260 --> 43:01.681
You've been getting healthy.
You been lifting a little weights?

43:01.889 --> 43:05.184
Not lifting weights
so much as losing weight.

43:05.393 --> 43:08.062
-You always looked good to me.
-Thanks.

43:08.229 --> 43:10.606
-You want something to drink?
-I'm fine.

43:10.773 --> 43:11.858
Sit down.

43:12.650 --> 43:15.278
It's been too long.
The last time I saw you--

43:15.361 --> 43:18.239
That night. I feel terrible about that.

43:19.574 --> 43:22.910
That was the low point.
I'd found out about Hector and Gwen.

43:22.994 --> 43:26.414
You came to help me out,
I took advantage of the situation.

43:26.497 --> 43:30.001
Talk about bottoming out. I was drunk.
I think I kissed you.

43:32.462 --> 43:33.379
Did I?

43:35.423 --> 43:37.258
I don't remember.

43:37.425 --> 43:38.968
If I did will you forgive me?

43:39.260 --> 43:41.471
-Sure. Yeah.
-Thanks Kik.

43:42.764 --> 43:43.848
Are you okay?

43:43.931 --> 43:48.352
A couple of hours ago, I'd have said no,
but something happened tonight that was really incredible.

43:48.603 --> 43:53.733
I was out walking by the cottages, and
it was like Gwen was drawing me to her.

43:54.150 --> 43:55.860
I just look over this wall.

43:55.943 --> 44:00.281
There she was, she was standing by the pool,
all dressed in white...

44:00.448 --> 44:03.451
...like an angel in the desert.
I thought to myself:

44:03.618 --> 44:06.829
"That's why you're here.
You're supposed to win her back."

44:06.954 --> 44:08.956
No way she'll stay with Hector.

44:09.040 --> 44:12.710
That's the woman I'm supposed to spend
the rest of my life with.

44:13.294 --> 44:17.298
Really? The woman by the pool?

44:19.467 --> 44:20.551
Gwen.

44:21.761 --> 44:24.555
-That's why I'm here.
-What do you mean?

44:28.810 --> 44:32.230
-Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are rocking out.
-What are you talking about?

44:32.438 --> 44:34.148
Kiki and Eddie are coming down.

44:34.232 --> 44:36.776
-Why did you say that?
-It's code. It's fun.

44:36.943 --> 44:38.736
I wonder what she wants.

44:38.903 --> 44:42.323
I don't know what she wants.
It'd be good to find out.

44:42.490 --> 44:43.908
I know what I want.

44:43.991 --> 44:47.286
Siegfried and Roy left the building,
heading for the pool.

44:47.370 --> 44:50.248
-Siegfried and Roy are here?
-Not the real Siegfried--

44:50.331 --> 44:52.625
You wanted to play this game, schmuck.

44:52.708 --> 44:55.670
Heads, she never sees me again.
Tails, we get back together.

44:55.753 --> 44:57.880
-You need to flip a coin for that?
-Correct.

44:58.005 --> 45:00.383
Here we go. One, two, three.

45:00.842 --> 45:02.844
-Possum.
-A possible possum.

45:04.512 --> 45:06.013
Wait, not here.

45:06.180 --> 45:10.560
Felix, this is Oscar. The monkey is
in day-care. Repeat, monkey is in day-care.

45:26.909 --> 45:28.911
Your mystery date awaits.

45:30.079 --> 45:31.414
Wish me luck.

45:55.855 --> 46:00.651
Oh, Eddie. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

46:01.194 --> 46:05.740
I know you'll never forgive me,
but please, please take me back.

46:07.533 --> 46:10.495
That a gun in your pocket
or are you just happy to see me?

46:10.578 --> 46:12.121
Actually, it's a gun.

46:36.604 --> 46:38.689
-Hello, Eddie.
-Hi, Gwen.

46:38.898 --> 46:41.734
-I've been so worried about you.
-Have you been?

46:43.111 --> 46:46.697
That's how it goes when your wife
shacks up with somebody else.

46:47.407 --> 46:49.367
I've got a lot of anger to deal with.

46:49.450 --> 46:53.955
I understand. Get that out.
Just shake it out. Throw it away.

46:54.163 --> 46:56.249
That's great advice. Thank you.

46:56.499 --> 46:58.459
I know I have no right to ask you this--

46:58.584 --> 47:00.878
-Ask me what?
-When we did the movie...

47:01.003 --> 47:03.005
...did you fool around with anybody?

47:03.089 --> 47:07.969
You're right. You've got no right to ask me that.
And no, for your information I wasn't fooling around.

47:08.219 --> 47:12.390
-The girl who played your daughter?
-Are you out of your mind? What the hell is wrong with you, Gwen?

47:12.473 --> 47:15.393
-You're very hostile.
-I can't imagine why.

47:15.476 --> 47:16.936
This was a big mistake.

47:17.019 --> 47:19.397
-No, it wasn't.
-Yes, it was. Tomorrow...

47:19.480 --> 47:22.608
...let's be professional
and promote this movie...

47:22.817 --> 47:25.820
...because we both need this one
to do well.

47:26.028 --> 47:27.447
I know you do.

47:29.282 --> 47:34.245
And if they ask about the break-up,
we just say that it was a difficult time...

47:34.495 --> 47:37.165
...that we're working through it together.

47:37.623 --> 47:40.334
-And we're still really close, okay?
-Fine.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.628
-Whatever.
-Good.

47:43.671 --> 47:44.922
I have to go.

47:50.845 --> 47:52.221
I see you tomorrow.

47:52.305 --> 47:53.556
You're not....

47:56.851 --> 48:00.063
-Here. There you go.
-Thanks.

48:54.826 --> 48:58.955
That's how junkets go.
It's a great opportunity. I can handle it.

48:59.580 --> 49:02.667
Is this a scene from their new movie,
Time Over Time?

49:02.875 --> 49:07.046
No. That's Gwen Harrison and Eddie
Thomas dancing in the moonlight for real.

49:07.588 --> 49:10.925
-Hard to believe....
-What the hell is going on?

49:11.592 --> 49:13.469
...in a passionate embrace.

49:13.803 --> 49:14.971
Goddamn it!

49:15.054 --> 49:17.265
My life is so stressful.

49:17.473 --> 49:20.184
People have no idea
what it's like being me.

49:20.393 --> 49:22.186
-Did we brush my teeth?
-Yes.

49:22.270 --> 49:24.397
See? I can't even remember that.

49:26.065 --> 49:29.652
Good morning, you two.
Come on, smile. Here we go. Smile.

49:29.861 --> 49:33.448
Ladies and gentlemen, here they are,
Eddie and Gwen, together again!

49:36.200 --> 49:39.454
There they are! America's Sweethearts!

49:46.085 --> 49:48.129
What is this? Only five minutes?

49:48.212 --> 49:51.340
Mention jerking-off and I'll pull your plug,
so to speak.

49:51.424 --> 49:55.553
Five minutes is plenty of time
to talk about a movie I haven't seen.

49:55.762 --> 49:57.597
Yeah, but it's fabulous.

50:01.225 --> 50:02.769
Do you need anything?

50:03.978 --> 50:05.897
-Doesn't she look great?
-Who?

50:06.105 --> 50:08.316
Your sister. She looks incredible.

50:08.608 --> 50:13.071
-Are you trying to make me jealous?
-Is it possible to do that at this point?

50:13.279 --> 50:15.114
Then why care if I try?

50:15.323 --> 50:17.200
Okay, who's happy? Ready to go?

50:17.283 --> 50:19.577
Thanks. Always a pleasure. Here we go.

50:19.702 --> 50:21.412
Byron, it's all yours.

50:23.873 --> 50:26.793
Byron Allen, coming to you
from Entertainment Studios.com.

50:27.001 --> 50:30.671
Strap yourself in,
I'm sitting with America's Sweethearts:

50:30.838 --> 50:32.882
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison.

50:33.007 --> 50:36.135
And are you ready for this?
They're not trying to kill each other.

50:36.511 --> 50:40.098
Are you back together?
You look very comfortable with each other.

50:40.348 --> 50:43.643
I want to be honest with you.
Before I came down from the room...

50:43.726 --> 50:46.187
...l took about half a pound of Vicodin.

50:46.938 --> 50:49.148
I'll be comfortable till late March.

50:54.445 --> 50:57.115
You're funny.
How do you live with him, Gwen?

50:57.365 --> 50:58.741
She doesn't.

51:00.118 --> 51:02.036
She lives with someone else.

51:04.956 --> 51:07.500
It must've been exciting
working with Hal Weidmann.

51:07.625 --> 51:10.002
Were you apprehensive when you started?

51:10.211 --> 51:13.214
Oh, no. No, Hal's brilliant.

51:14.715 --> 51:16.467
He's so easy to work with.

51:16.551 --> 51:18.678
He loves actors.

51:18.886 --> 51:20.346
Just loves actors.

51:20.805 --> 51:23.683
You had a nervous breakdown recently,
didn't you?

51:24.809 --> 51:25.810
What?

51:26.060 --> 51:30.690
Will audiences watch you again without
remembering your attack on Ms. Harrison?

51:32.150 --> 51:33.401
That's five minutes.

51:33.484 --> 51:34.861
Thank you, Dave.

51:36.571 --> 51:40.324
It was so great meeting you guys.
I'm a huge fan.

51:40.908 --> 51:41.659
Lunch?

51:47.123 --> 51:48.958
Why does he get a neck rub?

51:49.500 --> 51:51.502
-I want one.
-He's so tense.

51:51.711 --> 51:55.465
Hello? I have a neck, too.
This thing holding up my head.

51:56.549 --> 51:57.800
And we're back.

51:58.426 --> 52:00.720
-Everybody ready?
-Of course.

52:02.263 --> 52:03.347
Of course.

52:06.893 --> 52:10.897
Hello again, Syracuse.
I'm Mort Josephson, your movie maven.

52:11.105 --> 52:14.442
Ann Arbor, I'm Laura Messinger,
Channel Seven's cinemaniac.

52:14.525 --> 52:16.819
-The popcorn's buttered.
-The lights are dimming.

52:16.903 --> 52:18.863
-It's time to join Bob--
-And Ken.

52:18.946 --> 52:20.615
At the Multiplex.

52:21.032 --> 52:25.119
Eddie and I are great friends.
We talk every day.

52:25.328 --> 52:29.248
Eddie and I are better friends
than we've ever been. We talk two...

52:29.499 --> 52:31.042
...three times a day.

52:31.125 --> 52:34.629
We're just cosmically,
like, spiritually bound.

52:34.796 --> 52:36.547
Eddie's really good...

52:36.756 --> 52:39.217
...and he's my pillar of strength.

52:39.425 --> 52:43.012
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah.
I mean, so strong, you know?

52:43.262 --> 52:44.889
And that's five minutes.

52:44.972 --> 52:48.142
In spite of all the emotion
and the hurting...

52:49.352 --> 52:51.729
...we leaned on each other for support.

52:51.979 --> 52:54.440
That's when I realized how strong...

52:55.274 --> 52:57.235
...our friendship really was.

52:58.194 --> 53:00.405
-We were in constant contact.
-That's right.

53:00.488 --> 53:03.449
I mean, not only are we great friends...

53:03.658 --> 53:06.577
...and not only
are we in constant contact....

53:06.786 --> 53:09.163
You should see some of the phone bills.

53:09.831 --> 53:10.998
We've also done....

53:11.124 --> 53:15.336
I don't know, how should I put this?
Hell, I'll just say it.

53:15.753 --> 53:17.797
We've done a couple of three-ways.

53:17.880 --> 53:19.882
This guy she's with now....

53:20.007 --> 53:22.969
I can't say I'm happy about it.
She's my wife.

53:23.177 --> 53:25.930
But after spending time
in the sack with him...

53:26.055 --> 53:27.765
...l see the attraction.

53:28.349 --> 53:30.435
I have to say, for a fairly big guy...

53:30.518 --> 53:33.062
...he's not packing much
south of the border.

53:33.187 --> 53:36.149
And that's five minutes.
Thank you so much.

53:36.357 --> 53:39.277
Say hi to everybody in Salt Lake.
Good to see you.

53:40.236 --> 53:40.987
Next.

53:41.612 --> 53:43.114
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, guys.

53:43.364 --> 53:45.742
-It wasn't very funny.
-It was a joke.

53:45.950 --> 53:47.618
I do that after 400 interviews.

53:47.702 --> 53:50.413
-Hector won't find it very funny.
-Guess what?

53:50.621 --> 53:53.291
I don't give a shit what Hector thinks.

53:54.125 --> 53:56.043
A picture with my baby?

53:56.627 --> 53:58.588
Just smile and shut up.

54:04.677 --> 54:06.721
You have given me 110 percent today.

54:07.055 --> 54:08.389
-Who has? Me?
-You have.

54:08.473 --> 54:09.974
It's been a great day.

54:10.058 --> 54:12.727
-What do you want?
-It has. A small favour.

54:12.935 --> 54:14.645
-45 minutes, an hour.
-No.

54:14.729 --> 54:17.190
-I need you to have dinner with Gwen.
-No.

54:17.273 --> 54:19.901
-It'll be great.
-It won't, because I won't do it.

54:19.984 --> 54:21.736
-You must.
-I'm going to my room.

54:21.819 --> 54:24.655
I'll go into the minibar,
spend time with myself.

54:24.739 --> 54:26.699
We're in deep shit. We don't have the film.

54:26.783 --> 54:30.369
Hal's holding the film hostage.
We have nothing! Understand?

54:30.661 --> 54:33.039
But I do have you. You and Gwen.

54:33.122 --> 54:36.334
When you two are together,
the press forgets there's no film.

54:36.417 --> 54:39.670
It's roses blooming, flags flying,
butterscotch pudding.

54:39.837 --> 54:42.048
-Are you on something?
-It's a panic high.

54:42.173 --> 54:46.094
Just order an entrÃ©e, chew a little bit,
smile and go.

54:46.344 --> 54:48.554
They have a delightful pork tenderloin tonight.

54:48.679 --> 54:50.390
8.00. Thank you so much!

54:50.640 --> 54:51.891
-It was Gwen's idea.
-Really?

54:51.974 --> 54:52.809
Absolutely.

54:54.644 --> 54:57.563
I can't believe you said
I'd have dinner with him.

54:57.688 --> 55:00.400
I hear they serve
a very nice pork tenderloin.

55:00.650 --> 55:03.194
I'm not going. Here.

55:03.694 --> 55:06.906
I've been with him enough today
for the rest of my life.

55:07.490 --> 55:09.867
I have to give him the divorce papers.

55:10.368 --> 55:11.619
When will you do that?

55:11.994 --> 55:13.579
Just before we leave.

55:14.163 --> 55:17.500
What, will you toss them at him
as your limo pulls away?

55:17.708 --> 55:20.336
Kiki, you don't understand. It's complicated.

55:20.878 --> 55:24.465
I'm trying to be nice to him, so it'll be easier
when I give him the papers.

55:24.549 --> 55:27.009
But if I'm nice, he thinks there's hope.

55:27.385 --> 55:29.512
-Is that your foot?
-Sorry.

55:30.555 --> 55:32.265
Pedicure. Hello?

55:32.515 --> 55:36.269
-So when you're nice, he thinks--
-I can't talk about it right now.

55:37.061 --> 55:40.189
It's so hard being someone
people just don't get over.

55:41.566 --> 55:44.902
-Tell him I have a headache.
-I won't lie for you.

55:45.111 --> 55:47.572
-You lie for me all the time.
-Not to him.

55:48.531 --> 55:51.659
This is high school all over again.
Nothing's changed.

55:51.868 --> 55:55.037
When you wanted to break up
with your boyfriends at high school, did you do it?

55:55.121 --> 55:56.456
No, you made me do it.

55:56.539 --> 55:58.750
-I did not.
-Oh, please.

55:58.958 --> 56:01.502
Let's refresh your memory.
Robert Mancuta?

56:02.378 --> 56:04.922
Kyle Hassler? Toby Franks?
Half the lacrosse team?

56:05.006 --> 56:08.176
By the end of the year,
I was the most hated girl in school.

56:08.259 --> 56:09.343
That's not true.

56:09.427 --> 56:14.182
My quote in the yearbook was,
"Hey, we have to talk." I was despised.

56:14.766 --> 56:16.893
Fine. Don't go.

56:17.685 --> 56:21.606
Eddie will sit there like an idiot.
And it'll be all your fault.

56:23.566 --> 56:24.650
Whatever.

56:29.989 --> 56:31.574
-How are you?
-Lee.

56:32.033 --> 56:33.910
-Where's the film?
-What?

56:34.160 --> 56:37.663
The film's in its canister,
waiting to be shown, to go into history.

56:37.789 --> 56:39.415
There is no film, is there?

56:39.499 --> 56:43.836
What have I seen five times that gave me
the best feeling I've ever had in a theatre?

56:43.920 --> 56:46.589
You'll have a great time. See you later.

56:47.298 --> 56:50.676
We're doomed. We're dead.
We're doomed. Thank you.

57:07.693 --> 57:09.987
Look at you. You clean up good.

57:10.238 --> 57:11.239
Thanks.

57:11.614 --> 57:12.698
What's going on?

57:12.782 --> 57:16.619
Gwen isn't feeling well,
so she won't make it to dinner.

57:19.414 --> 57:20.665
She isn't sick.

57:20.832 --> 57:22.083
Not physically.

57:23.584 --> 57:26.254
I just didn't want you to sit here,
wondering.

57:26.337 --> 57:28.005
Thanks. Really.

57:29.173 --> 57:31.884
Want to join me? Come on.
Haven't you read the papers?

57:31.968 --> 57:35.638
I'm unstable. Don't let me alone with me.
Join me. We'll catch up.

57:35.763 --> 57:37.598
-A few minutes.
-Yeah.

57:39.809 --> 57:41.436
We have an understudy.

57:42.228 --> 57:44.689
They never make it easy, do they?

57:45.398 --> 57:47.108
The house phone, please.

57:50.236 --> 57:51.404
Thank you.

57:52.905 --> 57:55.825
Hello, darling.
Holly Golightly's cottage, please?

57:56.242 --> 57:57.910
-Who's that?
-Gwen's code name.

57:57.994 --> 57:59.912
From Breakfast at Tiffany's.

58:00.204 --> 58:01.372
What's that?

58:02.540 --> 58:04.208
It's a movie, a great movie.

58:04.292 --> 58:06.210
-Hepburn?
-Right. Katharine.

58:09.046 --> 58:10.590
Let me tell you something:

58:10.673 --> 58:14.510
Don't tell anybody
you're in the movie business. Thank you.

58:15.470 --> 58:17.555
Hello? Hey, Gwen, it's Lee.

58:17.764 --> 58:20.725
I'm at the restaurant, and guess what?
You're not.

58:21.350 --> 58:22.769
Are you okay?

58:23.061 --> 58:24.312
Oh, that's too bad.

58:24.437 --> 58:27.774
No, Eddie's fine. He's with Kiki.
She looks unbelievable.

58:27.899 --> 58:30.276
It may be a little
Hello, Young Lovers for me.

58:30.359 --> 58:33.946
I may have some fires to put out later.
But that's my problem.

58:34.238 --> 58:37.200
Have a nice night.
Feel better. Okay. 'Bye.

58:37.950 --> 58:39.035
Five minutes.

58:39.118 --> 58:41.037
-You're amazing.
-Take notes, kid.

58:42.497 --> 58:43.581
Larry Flange for Let's Go to the Movies.

58:43.706 --> 58:47.085
I'm sitting here with the lovely
and talented Miss Kiki Harrison.

58:47.168 --> 58:50.671
You play a lesbian fire-fighter
on an oil rig in the North Sea.

58:50.755 --> 58:54.258
One word comes to mind: Typecasting.
Your thoughts. And then:

58:54.342 --> 58:56.469
You really want my thoughts?

58:58.137 --> 58:59.305
-Larry.
-Larry.

58:59.847 --> 59:01.182
Okay, Larry...

59:01.474 --> 59:02.934
...the truth is...

59:05.686 --> 59:08.231
...after playing Madame Curie...

59:08.898 --> 59:11.109
...and discovering radium...

59:11.818 --> 59:14.028
...I just thought it would be a hoot...

59:14.112 --> 59:17.073
...to strap on those big rubber boots...

59:17.407 --> 59:21.244
...kiss my favourite gal goodbye
and go fight some fire.

59:21.369 --> 59:22.870
Very personal role for you.

59:22.954 --> 59:25.248
-Very close to my heart.
-Nice.

59:25.498 --> 59:28.584
-That's funny. You're funny.
-I am. Yeah.

59:29.627 --> 59:33.464
Remember when we were in Carolina,
doing Silent Run? We rented that go-cart?

59:33.548 --> 59:35.508
You attacked the director....

59:35.717 --> 59:39.762
-I didn't. There was no attacking.
-You rammed him repeatedly.

59:39.971 --> 59:41.222
Then you rammed me.

59:41.347 --> 59:43.641
He cut me off. Ramming you was different.

59:43.725 --> 59:45.393
And you rammed Gwen.

59:46.853 --> 59:49.063
-She wasn't laughing, and we were.
-Furious.

59:49.188 --> 59:51.649
-She wasn't too happy.
-No.

59:52.525 --> 59:54.736
That memory kept popping in my head.

59:54.986 --> 59:56.738
Those were good times.

01:00:00.658 --> 01:00:02.243
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

01:00:02.326 --> 01:00:04.787
She's your sister. I understand.

01:00:05.037 --> 01:00:08.624
But you're my friend,
and I just let myself get kind of....

01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:10.585
It's good to see you now.

01:00:10.668 --> 01:00:12.420
It's good to see you now.

01:00:13.629 --> 01:00:15.339
That's a nice necklace.

01:00:16.382 --> 01:00:18.134
It's not really mine.

01:00:18.342 --> 01:00:19.343
I know.

01:00:19.552 --> 01:00:21.846
-It's Gwen's.
-I know.

01:00:22.055 --> 01:00:23.306
She gave it to me.

01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:25.433
And I gave it to her.

01:00:27.518 --> 01:00:28.686
I know.

01:00:29.437 --> 01:00:32.106
-It looks good on you, though.
-Thank you.

01:00:34.734 --> 01:00:36.235
What are you thinking right now?

01:00:36.319 --> 01:00:40.573
I'm thinking about something
I shouldn't be thinking about.

01:00:40.782 --> 01:00:43.159
Me, too. What were you thinking about?

01:00:43.284 --> 01:00:45.995
How much I really want to eat
that breadstick.

01:00:46.204 --> 01:00:48.081
You want to eat this?

01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:51.793
No, I don't eat bread.
I just dream about bread.

01:00:52.043 --> 01:00:55.129
I've been going to a lot
of dream analysis since I...

01:00:55.213 --> 01:00:56.964
-...cracked up.
-At the centre.

01:00:57.048 --> 01:00:59.425
At the centre. And I believe...

01:00:59.926 --> 01:01:03.846
...bread represents something forbidden
you want but can't have.

01:01:04.055 --> 01:01:05.223
What do you think?

01:01:05.306 --> 01:01:09.602
I think when I dream about bread...

01:01:09.811 --> 01:01:11.813
...that would represent...

01:01:13.398 --> 01:01:14.482
...bread.

01:01:15.316 --> 01:01:16.651
Pretty much.

01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:20.238
What are you thinking about?

01:01:21.906 --> 01:01:22.907
Gwen...

01:01:24.492 --> 01:01:25.660
...is here.

01:01:28.162 --> 01:01:29.956
Sorry I'm late.

01:01:30.164 --> 01:01:33.459
-Thought you weren't well.
-All better. Just like that.

01:01:33.709 --> 01:01:35.128
Thanks. You can go.

01:01:35.211 --> 01:01:37.422
-She doesn't have to go.
-No, it's fine.

01:01:37.505 --> 01:01:39.882
-Stay. Have dinner with us.
-Good to see you.

01:01:39.966 --> 01:01:42.510
-I need some mouthwash.
-Okay, right away.

01:01:43.344 --> 01:01:44.887
So....

01:01:45.096 --> 01:01:48.474
I hear they have great pork tenderloin.
Yummy.

01:01:48.558 --> 01:01:51.978
-She didn't have to go.
-Thank you, honey. You look great, too.

01:01:58.109 --> 01:02:01.487
-Excuse me. Is Holly Golightly here?
-What is the name?

01:02:01.571 --> 01:02:02.947
Holly Golightly.

01:02:03.197 --> 01:02:06.159
-What the hell is he doing here?
-I'll get rid of him.

01:02:06.242 --> 01:02:09.370
No. Get a camera.
Film, tape, anything. Go, go!

01:02:10.288 --> 01:02:12.415
It's Gwen Harrison. The actress?

01:02:12.582 --> 01:02:15.626
-Lee Phillips. We met the other day.
-Where is Gwen?

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:18.421
-I want to see my Gwen.
-I don't want to get involved.

01:02:18.504 --> 01:02:21.132
You're all adults.
People in love, how to stop them?

01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:24.635
What are you talking about?
Where's Gwen? I want to see her now.

01:02:24.761 --> 01:02:29.015
I can't cover for them anymore.
They're in the restaurant. That's all I'll say.

01:02:29.098 --> 01:02:32.769
They're right over there.
She's in the red dress, over there.

01:02:37.523 --> 01:02:38.983
-Hi.
-Hector!

01:02:40.526 --> 01:02:41.694
Jesus.

01:02:41.903 --> 01:02:43.821
-That's all right.
-Hi, Gene.

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:45.990
Don't wave at him like that.

01:02:46.199 --> 01:02:47.867
I promote my movies.

01:02:48.076 --> 01:02:48.993
I know.

01:02:49.368 --> 01:02:50.745
It's part of the biz.

01:02:50.828 --> 01:02:52.080
I apologize.

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:53.790
-I'm sorry.
-Hector.

01:02:53.998 --> 01:02:56.292
-I apologize for him, too.
-Hector's here.

01:02:56.417 --> 01:02:59.337
What's going on?
For why are you sitting with him?

01:02:59.712 --> 01:03:02.632
Get in there.
Would you get out of the way?

01:03:04.008 --> 01:03:06.719
Good. Get that side. Let's go.

01:03:07.011 --> 01:03:08.471
What are you doing here?

01:03:08.554 --> 01:03:11.015
Protecting the woman I love.
What are you doing?

01:03:11.099 --> 01:03:14.685
-I'll let you two catch up.
-Why don't you be quiet, okay?

01:03:14.894 --> 01:03:17.438
-I'll get to you in a minute.
-Don't point.

01:03:17.772 --> 01:03:19.607
Don't tell me what to do.

01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:24.654
-Don't you trust me, Hector?
-I trust you implicitly.

01:03:25.113 --> 01:03:27.990
It's this asshole I don't trust. I don't!

01:03:28.157 --> 01:03:30.368
"Mecka lecka halava beem sala beem."

01:03:30.576 --> 01:03:32.370
What? What did you say?

01:03:34.205 --> 01:03:36.916
I hope he's not making fun of my accent.

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:41.212
Okay, enough!
You guys enjoy your little public display!

01:03:41.421 --> 01:03:42.588
I'm leaving.

01:03:42.964 --> 01:03:45.341
Okay, pussy boy's leaving.

01:03:45.591 --> 01:03:48.219
What's the matter? You don't like that?

01:03:48.428 --> 01:03:50.888
Maybe you want to take a swing at me?

01:03:51.347 --> 01:03:53.141
Tall boy. Come on.

01:03:53.641 --> 01:03:54.976
What are you....

01:03:56.144 --> 01:03:57.603
-What is that?
-Let's go.

01:03:57.687 --> 01:03:59.647
Please. Please, make my day.

01:04:01.232 --> 01:04:04.736
You're a genius
beyond my wildest expectations.

01:04:04.944 --> 01:04:08.197
The tracking is up.
Spielberg has moved off of our date.

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:11.284
This is good! Hit him!

01:04:11.492 --> 01:04:12.952
-Who?
-Anybody.

01:04:13.161 --> 01:04:15.621
-I won't fight you!
-Because you're a pussy boy.

01:04:15.705 --> 01:04:17.915
Because I'm trying to find some peace.

01:04:17.999 --> 01:04:20.668
You want peace? Okay, he wants peace.

01:04:21.586 --> 01:04:24.047
-Pussy boy's leaving.
-Don't you do that.

01:04:24.297 --> 01:04:25.631
Hector, don't.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.508
Don't tell me, "Don't."

01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:29.844
Maybe you want a piece of me, huh?

01:04:30.887 --> 01:04:32.221
-You see?
-Okay?

01:04:34.223 --> 01:04:35.850
Huh, pussy.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.936
There shouldn't be a problem here.

01:04:39.145 --> 01:04:40.313
After all...

01:04:40.813 --> 01:04:44.317
...you stole my wife and I tried to kill you.
We're pretty much even.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.444
You crumpled duck!

01:04:48.237 --> 01:04:50.198
Oh! Dear me!

01:04:54.619 --> 01:04:55.787
Go away!

01:04:57.914 --> 01:04:59.624
Punk! You hungry?

01:04:59.832 --> 01:05:01.542
Eat this, punk! Eat it!

01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:03.211
Are you hungry?

01:05:07.173 --> 01:05:08.591
I love your work.

01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:19.894
Eddie. You forgot something.

01:05:22.397 --> 01:05:24.273
-Did you see him go down?
-Shut up.

01:05:24.357 --> 01:05:26.901
-Don't tell me to shut up.
-Why did you do that?

01:05:26.984 --> 01:05:28.986
I didn't have to do it. I wanted to.

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:32.490
-Just deal with it. In there.
-It was my pleasure.

01:05:35.701 --> 01:05:37.203
Did you see that?

01:05:41.499 --> 01:05:43.459
-Everybody back, please.
-Eddie, are you okay?

01:05:45.545 --> 01:05:47.130
Eddie. Are you okay?

01:05:47.338 --> 01:05:51.551
I can feel my nose in the back of my throat.
Is that bad?

01:05:51.759 --> 01:05:53.177
Can you hear me?

01:05:54.554 --> 01:05:57.014
-Let's all just step back.
-Some ice, please.

01:05:58.141 --> 01:06:01.102
I swear to God, Gwen can be just horrible.

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:06.065
How can you love somebody and not like
them at the same time? Seems strange.

01:06:06.733 --> 01:06:09.277
-You need to lie down.
-I thought I was lying down.

01:06:09.402 --> 01:06:11.612
Why don't we try sitting down?

01:06:12.113 --> 01:06:13.573
There we go.

01:06:14.323 --> 01:06:15.825
Let me have a look.

01:06:17.285 --> 01:06:19.120
-It doesn't look good.
-No?

01:06:19.328 --> 01:06:20.580
Cold.

01:06:22.457 --> 01:06:23.458
What happened?

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:26.294
I just thought I needed
another humiliating photo op.

01:06:26.919 --> 01:06:29.922
I tried to walk away,
but the guy just kept pushing.

01:06:30.006 --> 01:06:33.843
So I hit him in the tray with my face.
I should've just walked away.

01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:38.264
For some reason these days,
I always do the stupid thing.

01:06:39.432 --> 01:06:41.267
This doesn't look good.

01:07:09.504 --> 01:07:12.465
-What was that?
-Another stupid thing.

01:07:13.216 --> 01:07:16.803
Stupid and maybe verging on crazy or....

01:07:17.637 --> 01:07:19.180
It's fine....

01:07:23.351 --> 01:07:26.312
There he is. The master!

01:07:26.813 --> 01:07:28.731
I'll have whatever he's having.

01:07:29.982 --> 01:07:33.277
I have to say,
you have completely outdone yourself.

01:07:33.361 --> 01:07:36.322
In 24 hours,
you've given us a walk in the woods...

01:07:36.489 --> 01:07:39.158
...a romantic dinner and a fistfight.

01:07:39.492 --> 01:07:41.869
I can't wait to see what happens next.

01:07:43.162 --> 01:07:46.541
Maybe I can get him to commit suicide.
Would you like that?

01:07:48.668 --> 01:07:50.962
I don't know. Let me think about it.

01:07:52.588 --> 01:07:56.259
It won't help the initial release,
but the video will rent like crazy.

01:07:56.342 --> 01:07:58.636
We could do a box like a coffin.

01:07:58.845 --> 01:08:00.847
Yeah. That's good. No, wait.

01:08:01.556 --> 01:08:05.893
Imagine if he killed himself
at the premiere.

01:08:09.188 --> 01:08:12.567
I'm joking. I'm thinking out loud
or whatever you call it.

01:08:13.317 --> 01:08:14.318
Goodnight, Dave.

01:08:14.444 --> 01:08:16.194
Goodnight, Lee.

01:08:19.991 --> 01:08:21.367
Good work!

01:08:34.046 --> 01:08:35.131
Hi.

01:08:44.307 --> 01:08:46.392
Good morning.

01:08:49.145 --> 01:08:50.395
How do you feel?

01:08:50.479 --> 01:08:54.609
I feel good. I mean...

01:08:55.234 --> 01:08:57.361
...I feel weird, but I feel good.

01:08:57.487 --> 01:09:00.490
-You?
-I feel something along those lines.

01:09:01.407 --> 01:09:03.326
Good, weird. Weird, good.

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:07.412
Here's what I was thinking:
What about some breakfast?

01:09:08.413 --> 01:09:10.166
We'll take it from there.

01:09:10.957 --> 01:09:12.210
Okay.

01:09:13.294 --> 01:09:17.048
Why don't you order some breakfast.
I'll brush my teeth first.

01:09:18.256 --> 01:09:21.219
-Can I use your toothbrush?
-Yeah, it's in there.

01:09:28.684 --> 01:09:30.478
Can I get some juice?

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:34.524
Keek? Hello?

01:09:34.774 --> 01:09:37.777
Where are you? Kiki!

01:09:40.488 --> 01:09:41.988
Want some toast?

01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:46.202
You buttered my toast.

01:09:47.578 --> 01:09:49.497
No one's ever buttered my toast before.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.582
I don't eat toast with butter.
I don't eat toast.

01:09:53.459 --> 01:09:56.796
I'll stop talking now
and make an exception.

01:09:56.963 --> 01:09:58.047
Some tea?

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.344
It's hot.

01:10:03.469 --> 01:10:05.680
-Here. Okay.
-Thank you.

01:10:10.977 --> 01:10:14.188
No, I'm fine. I look like half a raccoon.
What's going on?

01:10:15.481 --> 01:10:16.941
Now's not a good time.

01:10:17.024 --> 01:10:21.362
Can we do it later? No, don't come here.
I'll come there.

01:10:21.821 --> 01:10:22.822
'Bye.

01:10:23.823 --> 01:10:25.241
That was Gwen.

01:10:25.533 --> 01:10:27.910
-She wants to talk.
-About what?

01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:30.997
I don't know. She didn't say.
But I better...

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:32.749
...go over there.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.210
Why didn't you say you'd see her later?

01:10:36.335 --> 01:10:39.338
I did, but she said she'd come here,
and I thought:

01:10:39.505 --> 01:10:44.385
"That's not a good idea." So I'd better
just go over there, given the situation.

01:10:45.219 --> 01:10:47.263
Will you tell her about last night?

01:10:47.346 --> 01:10:50.349
I don't know. I think I'll just let her talk.

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:53.102
-Know what I mean?
-Oh, yeah.

01:10:53.186 --> 01:10:56.773
Sounds like it's important
so I'll just let her say it.

01:10:57.023 --> 01:10:59.484
Then I'll go do these dumb interviews.

01:10:59.567 --> 01:11:02.487
I'll come back
and we'll have lunch together.

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:04.113
Does that sound good?

01:11:24.217 --> 01:11:26.052
You look terrible.

01:11:26.386 --> 01:11:29.097
-Does it hurt?
-Only when I'm awake.

01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:31.724
-He's not here by the way.
-Who?

01:11:31.933 --> 01:11:33.643
-Hector.
-That doesn't matter.

01:11:33.726 --> 01:11:35.269
Is Kiki here, though?

01:11:35.353 --> 01:11:36.604
I doubt it.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.985
I don't know where that girl is.

01:11:43.194 --> 01:11:44.654
"That girl" is here.

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:48.074
Nice of you to join us.

01:11:48.449 --> 01:11:50.034
Where have you been?

01:11:50.243 --> 01:11:53.371
Got up early. Things to do.
Nothing important.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.041
Would you make me
some scrambled eggs?

01:11:57.375 --> 01:12:00.044
-She makes great scrambled eggs.
-I remember.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.380
-Would you like some?
-No.

01:12:02.755 --> 01:12:04.549
Two scrambled eggs. Make mine runny.

01:12:04.632 --> 01:12:06.759
Order room service.
She doesn't have to cook.

01:12:06.843 --> 01:12:08.553
It would be my pleasure.

01:12:11.764 --> 01:12:13.850
What did you want to talk about?

01:12:14.976 --> 01:12:17.770
I think you're doing pretty well, huh?

01:12:18.062 --> 01:12:19.522
Are you feeling okay?

01:12:19.605 --> 01:12:23.025
Yeah, I'm better. I'm shocking myself.

01:12:23.776 --> 01:12:26.154
"l forgot how charming you were, Colonel."

01:12:26.237 --> 01:12:30.158
"And you, Miss Julip.
You're a warm breeze on a cool afternoon."

01:12:32.285 --> 01:12:33.536
What was that?

01:12:33.619 --> 01:12:35.288
"What was that?"

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.374
-What was that movie called?
-I don't remember.

01:12:38.499 --> 01:12:41.127
Kiki! What was that movie called?

01:12:41.794 --> 01:12:43.588
I don't give a shit!

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:45.882
No, that wasn't it.

01:12:46.007 --> 01:12:49.427
Anyway, you look like you're getting
to a good place.

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:52.930
Last night, when I saw you and Hector,
I was so conflicted.

01:12:53.181 --> 01:12:54.974
"Conflicted" is the word du jour.

01:12:55.058 --> 01:12:57.101
There's no question about that.

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.731
You know what? That's tired. She's tired.

01:13:01.981 --> 01:13:04.108
-Are you seeing anybody?
-Excuse me?

01:13:04.984 --> 01:13:06.611
Are you seeing anybody?

01:13:06.694 --> 01:13:08.321
Let me think about it.

01:13:10.031 --> 01:13:11.657
Um, not...

01:13:14.786 --> 01:13:15.953
...you know....

01:13:17.663 --> 01:13:19.791
-Not technically, no.
-What?

01:13:19.999 --> 01:13:21.709
He said "not technically"!

01:13:26.464 --> 01:13:29.425
That's fascinating. "Not technically."

01:13:29.634 --> 01:13:33.137
That's sad. Really, that's a shame.

01:13:33.846 --> 01:13:37.517
Here are your eggs, my darling sister.
I hope they're runny enough.

01:13:37.809 --> 01:13:40.436
And you, son of a bitch!
Here are your eggs!

01:13:40.645 --> 01:13:41.729
There you go!

01:13:41.854 --> 01:13:44.065
-What the hell is wrong with you Kiki?
-A lot, actually.

01:13:44.148 --> 01:13:47.151
I can't believe it's taken me
this long to figure it out.

01:13:47.235 --> 01:13:50.905
I'm going for a long walk now
just to simmer down.

01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:53.991
Before I do,
I'd like to cut through the bullshit.

01:13:54.325 --> 01:13:56.869
The reason he's "not technically"
seeing anyone...

01:13:56.953 --> 01:13:59.330
...is he's still "technically" hung up on you.

01:13:59.414 --> 01:14:02.041
And you! You moron!

01:14:02.542 --> 01:14:06.129
The reason she's here, besides trying
to salvage her precious career...

01:14:06.212 --> 01:14:08.673
...is to serve you with divorce papers.

01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:12.301
I've done all I can do here.
I'm going for a walk because that's....

01:14:12.427 --> 01:14:16.097
Leaving is just something
I've really perfected, so...

01:14:16.347 --> 01:14:18.808
...once more with feeling.

01:14:20.017 --> 01:14:22.145
She was much more fun when she was fat.

01:14:22.228 --> 01:14:23.479
Is that true?

01:14:23.938 --> 01:14:25.398
-What?
-About the papers.

01:14:25.523 --> 01:14:27.608
Yes, but now I don't know what to do.

01:14:27.775 --> 01:14:32.989
Seeing you again and being in front
of the press with you again. We have something, Eddie.

01:14:33.114 --> 01:14:36.284
Maybe I've made
a horrible, horrible mistake.

01:14:36.367 --> 01:14:39.412
Or maybe I should give you the papers.
I don't know.

01:14:41.497 --> 01:14:42.915
You're the devil.

01:14:51.257 --> 01:14:53.342
Kiki! Hold on. I wanna talk.

01:14:53.426 --> 01:14:54.844
-Hold on a minute.
-Let go.

01:14:54.927 --> 01:14:56.971
-I wanna talk to you.
-I don't!

01:14:57.055 --> 01:14:58.890
-Why not?
-You're an idiot.

01:14:58.973 --> 01:15:00.892
For that matter, I'm an idiot, too!

01:15:00.975 --> 01:15:03.603
In that respect,
we're perfect for each other.

01:15:03.686 --> 01:15:07.732
-This is a very complicated situation.
-Let me un-complicate it for you!

01:15:08.066 --> 01:15:12.862
Forget about what happened between us.
It's not gonna work. All right?

01:15:13.071 --> 01:15:15.531
Last night. Last night was great.

01:15:15.782 --> 01:15:19.869
But she calls you this morning
and you can't wait to get to her!

01:15:20.078 --> 01:15:22.538
What is that? It just won't work.

01:15:22.663 --> 01:15:24.665
You'll probably always think of her...

01:15:24.749 --> 01:15:28.336
...and I'll probably always be wondering
if you're thinking of her.

01:15:29.128 --> 01:15:30.296
I just....

01:15:31.089 --> 01:15:33.466
-I need you to know one thing.
-What?

01:15:34.467 --> 01:15:37.512
That woman that you saw
by the pool the other night.

01:15:37.804 --> 01:15:41.307
That woman you just have
to spend the rest of your life with.

01:15:44.519 --> 01:15:45.770
That was me.

01:15:58.449 --> 01:16:00.284
-Good morning.
-'Morning.

01:16:01.077 --> 01:16:03.162
So here's the buffet.

01:16:04.038 --> 01:16:05.581
What's going on?

01:16:07.041 --> 01:16:09.502
Nothing. I'm great.

01:16:09.961 --> 01:16:11.295
Just great.

01:16:11.713 --> 01:16:14.006
Ma'am, can I get some more butter?

01:16:14.841 --> 01:16:17.385
Word of advice:
When you hit Formica, stop.

01:16:17.719 --> 01:16:21.013
You know the expression,
"falling off the wagon"? This is it.

01:16:21.097 --> 01:16:24.267
But you got 20 or 30 pounds of food
to break your fall.

01:16:24.559 --> 01:16:26.185
What the hell happened?

01:16:26.269 --> 01:16:29.147
Bad morning. Preceded by 33 bad years.

01:16:29.355 --> 01:16:31.399
Does this have to do with Gwen?

01:16:31.607 --> 01:16:35.945
Of course not. I love my sister.
I love everything about her.

01:16:36.362 --> 01:16:39.031
"Kiki. Kiki-kins.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.325
"Who's smoking? I smell smoke.

01:16:41.534 --> 01:16:44.245
"ls someone smoking
within a six-mile radius?

01:16:44.662 --> 01:16:46.581
"Stop them, Kiki. Stop them."

01:16:46.664 --> 01:16:48.750
Oh, ma'am, the butter?

01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:51.711
Are they out of butter?
How can you run out?

01:16:51.794 --> 01:16:53.129
I have one theory.

01:16:53.212 --> 01:16:55.048
You know what? I need an assistant.

01:16:55.131 --> 01:16:58.468
If I had one, she'd be outside right now,
milking a cow...

01:16:58.551 --> 01:17:01.471
...and I'd never, ever run out of butter.

01:17:02.346 --> 01:17:06.267
"Kiki, my butter has touched another food.
I need new butter."

01:17:06.642 --> 01:17:09.604
"Anything you want, honey."
That's how it goes, right?

01:17:09.687 --> 01:17:12.398
You're a publicist.
Anything they want, right?

01:17:14.358 --> 01:17:16.152
She's got a green dress.

01:17:16.486 --> 01:17:18.237
Looks like crap on her.

01:17:18.321 --> 01:17:20.782
Brings out the circles under her eyes.
We both know it.

01:17:20.865 --> 01:17:23.076
She gave it to me. It looks nice on me.

01:17:23.159 --> 01:17:25.787
Then she said maybe she wanted it back.

01:17:26.204 --> 01:17:29.248
She doesn't want it.
She doesn't want me to have it. That's the truth

01:17:30.041 --> 01:17:32.043
So, you're in love with Eddie?

01:17:33.961 --> 01:17:35.630
Wouldn't that be stupid?

01:17:35.963 --> 01:17:38.174
I've done every one of their movies.

01:17:38.424 --> 01:17:41.594
I've never seen him look at her
the way he looks at you.

01:17:41.677 --> 01:17:44.138
If you're in love, just go for it.

01:17:44.972 --> 01:17:47.183
The way you went for this breakfast.

01:17:48.434 --> 01:17:50.895
Not the way you went for the breakfast.

01:17:56.943 --> 01:18:00.196
I think I'm going to be sick. Can you just....

01:18:08.329 --> 01:18:13.209
I'll take all of this to go.
I'll need 20, 30 bags and a forklift.

01:18:15.461 --> 01:18:17.130
No laugh, no tip.

01:18:39.736 --> 01:18:42.572
I really want to play a character
like the Terminator.

01:18:42.655 --> 01:18:46.159
Because I think the Hispanic people
are crying out to see...

01:18:46.409 --> 01:18:50.413
...a deadly, destructive killing machine
they can embrace as their own.

01:18:50.496 --> 01:18:53.750
-That they can relate to.
-How are you? Nice to see you.

01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:56.919
-How are you? Hal here yet?
-No.

01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:59.338
He's a dead man. No, I'm serious.

01:18:59.422 --> 01:19:03.718
I know a guy.
I'll make a call, and he's dead, because....

01:19:03.926 --> 01:19:07.430
How are you? Nice to see you.
Hope you're having a good time.

01:19:07.555 --> 01:19:09.390
-What time do you have?
-12:50.

01:19:09.474 --> 01:19:10.725
We're doomed.

01:19:10.933 --> 01:19:15.480
May I suggest that you follow my lead
and get completely shit-faced?

01:19:15.897 --> 01:19:20.401
-Hi, how are you? You look gorgeous.
-Hi, Mr. K. Thank you.

01:19:20.568 --> 01:19:24.614
How long must I stay with these people?
They're drunk and starting to touch.

01:19:24.697 --> 01:19:27.158
Hang in there.
If Hal doesn't show with the film...

01:19:27.241 --> 01:19:29.786
...they'll be busy finding
where to build the gallows.

01:19:29.911 --> 01:19:31.871
What? I don't think that's funny.

01:19:37.293 --> 01:19:38.753
Is that pussy boy?

01:19:43.383 --> 01:19:45.343
-He's going to jump.
-He's not kinda jump.

01:19:45.551 --> 01:19:47.762
I said I'd give him the divorce papers.

01:19:47.845 --> 01:19:49.597
Shit, he's going to jump!

01:19:50.348 --> 01:19:51.849
-Excuse me.
-Please, please.

01:19:51.933 --> 01:19:53.893
-We got to do something.
-I'll get him.

01:19:53.976 --> 01:19:57.230
Let's take advantage of this.
Get a helicopter. Get aerial shots.

01:19:57.313 --> 01:19:59.524
-Shut up.
-All right, yeah. Okay.

01:20:00.274 --> 01:20:01.359
Jump, jump.

01:20:01.484 --> 01:20:02.652
Jump, pussy, jump.

01:20:04.028 --> 01:20:05.655
I can't believe this.

01:20:08.991 --> 01:20:10.451
He'll be a pussy pancake.

01:20:10.535 --> 01:20:11.702
I'm coming!

01:20:19.544 --> 01:20:21.045
Why is he doing this to me?

01:20:21.129 --> 01:20:22.547
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:23.965
What are you doing?

01:20:24.048 --> 01:20:27.635
-I was trying to stop you from jumping!
-By trying to kill me?

01:20:28.094 --> 01:20:30.638
-Stay right there!
-Where am I gotta go?

01:20:31.597 --> 01:20:32.682
Right!

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.521
Oh, shit. Hang in there, Eddie!

01:20:39.397 --> 01:20:40.565
I'm coming!

01:20:43.526 --> 01:20:45.278
-All right.
-You going to hose me down?

01:20:45.361 --> 01:20:47.280
I'll throw it, and you catch it.

01:20:47.363 --> 01:20:48.948
One, two...

01:20:49.031 --> 01:20:50.116
...three.

01:20:54.495 --> 01:20:56.497
Pull yourself up. I got you.

01:20:56.956 --> 01:20:58.124
Come on.

01:20:59.167 --> 01:21:00.251
Got it?

01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:01.419
Good.

01:21:03.796 --> 01:21:05.840
Oh, my God!

01:21:08.009 --> 01:21:09.427
Pussy boy will go splat.

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:11.345
-Got it?
-Yeah.

01:21:12.346 --> 01:21:15.016
That's it. One foot at a time.
There you go.

01:21:17.018 --> 01:21:18.853
-Okay.
-I'm going to kill you.

01:21:18.936 --> 01:21:21.814
Take a bow. It'll look better. Take a bow.

01:21:28.154 --> 01:21:29.655
Jesus Christ.

01:21:33.159 --> 01:21:36.454
The next time you try to kill yourself,
take a hair dryer into the tub.

01:21:36.537 --> 01:21:39.332
-I wasn't trying to kill myself.
-What were you doing?

01:21:39.499 --> 01:21:42.627
I came here to think. Is that a crime?
Get some perspective?

01:21:42.710 --> 01:21:44.295
Do that in your room!

01:21:48.007 --> 01:21:49.675
I blew it.

01:21:50.718 --> 01:21:51.886
I lost her.

01:21:53.805 --> 01:21:55.431
Guy goes to his rabbi.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:58.893
He says, "Rabbi, I think my wife
is trying to poison me."

01:21:58.976 --> 01:22:01.187
The rabbi says, "let me talk to her."

01:22:01.312 --> 01:22:05.733
He comes back later, and says, "Listen.
I spoke to your wife for three hours.

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.318
"Take the poison."

01:22:08.069 --> 01:22:10.446
Understand what I'm saying? You and Gwen are over.

01:22:10.655 --> 01:22:13.908
I don't care about Gwen!
I'm talking about Kiki.

01:22:14.992 --> 01:22:19.122
She's the only one worth spending
any time with in this hellhole.

01:22:19.706 --> 01:22:23.126
No offence, you're a great guy.
You have some very nice qualities.

01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:26.379
But for a review, you'd sell me
to China for medical experiments.

01:22:26.462 --> 01:22:27.839
Don't let her get away.

01:22:27.922 --> 01:22:31.342
-It's too late.
-No, it's not. Trust me. I'm--

01:22:36.431 --> 01:22:37.974
-That's Hal!
-That's Hal?

01:22:38.057 --> 01:22:40.768
That maniac's here with the film!
We're saved!

01:22:40.852 --> 01:22:42.937
-We're beyond salvation.
-No, come on.

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.231
-You want to see the movie.
-I don't care about the movie.

01:22:45.356 --> 01:22:47.275
This could put you back on top.

01:22:47.358 --> 01:22:48.776
-You think? On top?
-Yes.

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:50.987
"May I have the envelope, please?"

01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:53.781
Hal! It's Hal.

01:23:00.872 --> 01:23:02.915
He's got the film. Go, go.

01:23:03.124 --> 01:23:04.625
The director.

01:23:04.792 --> 01:23:07.170
-He looks good.
-Yeah, he looks great.

01:23:11.883 --> 01:23:13.342
Everybody? Let's get started.

01:23:13.426 --> 01:23:16.387
I'm Lee Phillips.
Welcome to Time Over Time.

01:23:17.055 --> 01:23:18.306
Thank you.

01:23:19.474 --> 01:23:21.851
I'll go out on a ledge here and say....

01:23:23.269 --> 01:23:24.979
I couldn't help myself.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.400
Please welcome the man responsible
for this junket, Mr. Dave Kingman.

01:23:32.153 --> 01:23:33.905
Thank you very much, Lee.

01:23:34.238 --> 01:23:38.076
They say that good things
come to those who wait.

01:23:38.951 --> 01:23:41.746
I waited 20 years to work
with the great Hal Weidmann.

01:23:41.829 --> 01:23:44.665
I think Hal's cinematic influence
has been felt for--

01:23:44.749 --> 01:23:47.627
That's good. Thank you. That's good.

01:23:47.835 --> 01:23:49.170
Thank you.

01:23:50.755 --> 01:23:53.132
My name is Hal Weidmann. Hello.

01:23:57.095 --> 01:23:59.180
Ladies and gentlemen, this...

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:03.768
...is the most honest movie
I have ever made.

01:24:04.644 --> 01:24:08.648
I wasn't looking for it.
It came to me like a bus in the street.

01:24:09.023 --> 01:24:13.694
Or the woman who changes the flowers
at our desert house.

01:24:15.363 --> 01:24:18.157
I can't talk about this film
without weeping. Roll it, please.

01:24:19.242 --> 01:24:21.994
Thank you, Hal.
Have a great time, everybody!

01:24:41.556 --> 01:24:43.850
Sarah. My name is Ben. I must speak with you.

01:24:43.975 --> 01:24:45.893
-Who are you?
-That's not important.

01:24:45.977 --> 01:24:50.064
What's important now is your safety.
Listen to me Sarah, you're in grave danger.

01:24:50.148 --> 01:24:53.276
I don't know how to say this,
so I'll just come out and say it:

01:24:53.359 --> 01:24:55.987
-I'm from the future.
-Oh, my God!

01:24:56.571 --> 01:24:58.614
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:01.909
Come with me now. Now, Sarah, please.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.375
Love is a bridge built between two people.

01:25:09.584 --> 01:25:12.628
We want what exists between them...

01:25:13.713 --> 01:25:14.797
...to be real.

01:25:14.922 --> 01:25:17.008
My name is Hal Weidmann.

01:25:17.425 --> 01:25:21.095
The film you're about to see is
Time Over Time, or is it?

01:25:22.805 --> 01:25:25.600
The details are unimportant. Simply put...

01:25:25.808 --> 01:25:28.102
...the script was shit. I tossed it.

01:25:28.811 --> 01:25:32.565
-Instead I decided to let my camera capture real life.
-Just watch.

01:25:34.567 --> 01:25:37.779
I filmed my actors
without their knowledge.

01:25:37.987 --> 01:25:42.075
I let the camera run after takes.
I placed hidden cameras around the set.

01:25:42.408 --> 01:25:45.787
And the end resultis a story...

01:25:45.995 --> 01:25:51.209
...far more involving than anything
manufactured by actors and writers.

01:25:53.878 --> 01:25:56.005
This is real life.

01:25:56.255 --> 01:25:57.882
The juice.

01:25:58.466 --> 01:25:59.926
The stink.

01:26:02.136 --> 01:26:03.221
The glory.

01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:13.189
Often, you see a film and think,
"Where did the money go?"

01:26:13.272 --> 01:26:14.273
Shut up!

01:26:18.986 --> 01:26:20.613
It's gonna be good.

01:26:21.155 --> 01:26:24.659
I don't mean to pressure you,
but we're 15 days overschedule.

01:26:24.826 --> 01:26:26.077
Oh, no.

01:26:26.202 --> 01:26:27.912
What are we gonna do?

01:26:28.037 --> 01:26:32.333
I'm in the middle of shooting.
This is a sensitive time. Do me a favour.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.671
Go away. Please.
Never visit my set again.

01:26:40.133 --> 01:26:41.676
Watch him take it...

01:26:41.884 --> 01:26:43.636
...up the gazoo.

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.517
You're an idiot. I told you,
we never should've hired Hal Weidmann.

01:26:57.358 --> 01:27:00.445
"You do

01:27:01.028 --> 01:27:04.115
"something to me

01:27:04.741 --> 01:27:06.117
"Something

01:27:06.325 --> 01:27:11.372
"that simply mystifies me

01:27:12.206 --> 01:27:15.084
"Tell me

01:27:15.877 --> 01:27:19.088
"why should it be

01:27:19.464 --> 01:27:20.631
"You have

01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:26.220
"the power to hypnotise me

01:27:26.971 --> 01:27:30.391
"Let me

01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:33.853
"live 'neath your spell"

01:27:34.228 --> 01:27:36.105
You're so good in this.

01:27:36.564 --> 01:27:37.732
"...that voodoo

01:27:38.274 --> 01:27:40.151
"that you do"

01:27:41.736 --> 01:27:42.820
Cut.

01:27:45.531 --> 01:27:49.035
Hal! Hal!
Hal, can I get like three minutes?

01:27:49.744 --> 01:27:52.413
-Gwen, can I talk to you?
-I'm working.

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.875
Yes?

01:27:55.958 --> 01:27:58.044
-What's going on with you and him?
-Nothing.

01:27:58.127 --> 01:27:59.837
His hands are all over your ass.

01:27:59.921 --> 01:28:03.049
My character would've done that
at that point!

01:28:03.174 --> 01:28:06.344
-You look like a freaking prostitute!
-Oh, please. Cut it out.

01:28:06.427 --> 01:28:08.888
-Don't make a fool of me.
-Cut it out.

01:28:09.097 --> 01:28:11.849
I'm watching you every minute.
Do you hear me?

01:28:12.058 --> 01:28:13.643
Cut it out.

01:28:13.976 --> 01:28:15.353
Do you hear me?

01:28:18.815 --> 01:28:20.483
I think Eddie knows.

01:28:20.691 --> 01:28:21.943
Knows what?

01:28:22.777 --> 01:28:24.445
About me and Hector.

01:28:25.446 --> 01:28:29.534
-You said nothing's happening with him.
-Well, something happened.

01:28:34.288 --> 01:28:35.832
Do you see that zit?

01:28:36.958 --> 01:28:38.292
What the hell is this?

01:28:38.376 --> 01:28:39.877
You think I know?

01:28:40.962 --> 01:28:42.130
You bastard!

01:28:42.505 --> 01:28:44.590
-You see it?
-I'll get something.

01:28:45.133 --> 01:28:46.801
I slept with him.

01:28:46.968 --> 01:28:48.219
Hector?

01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:51.597
-Are you in love with him?
-Oh, come on.

01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:55.268
It's not always about love.
Sometimes you just need to get laid.

01:28:58.646 --> 01:29:00.231
I tell you, he's hot.

01:29:01.023 --> 01:29:03.985
Handsome. He can go for hours.

01:29:05.319 --> 01:29:07.947
Just wish he had a bigger,
you know, thingy.

01:29:11.492 --> 01:29:12.744
I love this movie.

01:29:12.827 --> 01:29:14.495
What do you mean?

01:29:14.996 --> 01:29:18.041
It's like a roll of quarters. It's like this.

01:29:22.003 --> 01:29:24.380
Well, maybe like this.

01:29:24.756 --> 01:29:26.132
I know too much.

01:29:29.927 --> 01:29:31.471
I'm going to scream.

01:29:31.721 --> 01:29:34.807
-I think it's very entertaining.
-Lee, get over here!

01:29:36.934 --> 01:29:40.021
You stop this right now.
I mean I'm gonna sue the studio.

01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:41.647
Lower your voice, darling.

01:29:41.731 --> 01:29:43.149
-Cut the film.
-Shut up.

01:29:43.232 --> 01:29:45.526
Excuse me. Was that deserved?

01:29:45.735 --> 01:29:49.405
I think so. You've ruined me.
You've ruined my career.

01:29:49.655 --> 01:29:53.076
Look at the screen.
Don't you realize what that is?

01:29:53.284 --> 01:29:55.953
That's reinvention. That's birth.

01:29:56.162 --> 01:29:59.415
That's life itself. Can't you smell the life?

01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:03.169
Pretty soon you'll smell Ira Stern,
my attorney!

01:30:04.462 --> 01:30:06.464
-Thank you, Hal.
-Wacko.

01:30:07.006 --> 01:30:11.636
The film's new direction caught some of us
a little bit off-guard.

01:30:12.303 --> 01:30:14.680
I am shocked. I'm outraged.

01:30:14.806 --> 01:30:15.973
There are textures!

01:30:16.099 --> 01:30:18.226
Can I just say something, please?

01:30:18.434 --> 01:30:22.605
What was said about my penis
is completely false. Completely.

01:30:22.814 --> 01:30:26.818
I'm extremely well-hung. I'll submit
to a physical inspection right now.

01:30:26.901 --> 01:30:29.445
I knew this film would be misunderstood.

01:30:29.654 --> 01:30:32.490
Kubrick was misunderstood. Godard.

01:30:32.698 --> 01:30:35.243
I'll kick your ass! Understand that!

01:30:35.493 --> 01:30:37.578
-Who are you?
-Who am I?

01:30:37.787 --> 01:30:40.707
-I'm the ass-kicker of you!
-Can I defend my father's work?

01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:42.709
No. Who's her father?

01:30:43.084 --> 01:30:44.669
-Hal.
-No, you cannot!

01:30:44.919 --> 01:30:47.380
Let me defend Hector.
I only slept with him once.

01:30:47.463 --> 01:30:50.133
His penis is bigger than a roll of quarters.

01:30:50.633 --> 01:30:52.385
-You slept with her?
-I did not.

01:30:52.468 --> 01:30:55.471
-You slept with her?
-I swear to God! She's lying.

01:30:55.555 --> 01:30:59.976
Except for the part about my penis.
That's true. It's bigger than coins.

01:31:00.143 --> 01:31:03.479
There will be a law suit.
Legal issues, invasion of privacy.

01:31:03.646 --> 01:31:05.565
-I agree.
-Damage to my career!

01:31:05.648 --> 01:31:07.066
Yes, yes, I know.

01:31:07.316 --> 01:31:10.069
Congratulations.
It's the most honest work I've done.

01:31:10.153 --> 01:31:12.905
-I'll work with you again.
-I've a script we can throw out.

01:31:12.989 --> 01:31:14.157
-You're wonderful.
-I'll send it to you.

01:31:15.283 --> 01:31:16.659
I have an announcement.

01:31:18.244 --> 01:31:20.955
I'd like to thank you all.
I'm so happy you're here...

01:31:21.039 --> 01:31:22.999
...and all our friends in the press...

01:31:23.082 --> 01:31:26.502
...who've been so supportive this last year.

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.464
I'm so happy to say:

01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:33.009
Eddie and I are getting back together.

01:31:38.306 --> 01:31:40.600
So thank you all so, so much.

01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:43.519
-What is this bullshit now?
-Be quiet.

01:31:43.686 --> 01:31:45.980
This is bullshit.

01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:48.649
This morning, Eddie came over to the cottage.

01:31:48.775 --> 01:31:52.528
We had breakfast and a heartfelt talk.
Didn't we, honey?

01:31:52.695 --> 01:31:55.448
I've wanted to get back
together with Gwen...

01:31:55.656 --> 01:32:00.119
...ever since we weren't together anymore.
I've been obsessed about it.

01:32:00.286 --> 01:32:01.371
How sweet.

01:32:01.454 --> 01:32:04.374
Now that it's happened, I have to say:

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.376
I'm amazed, and grateful.

01:32:06.626 --> 01:32:09.253
And I agree with Hector that it's bullshit.

01:32:09.379 --> 01:32:11.172
Thank you, thank you very much!

01:32:11.255 --> 01:32:13.049
-We talked about this.
-We didn't.

01:32:13.132 --> 01:32:14.300
-Yes, we did.
-No we didn't.

01:32:14.384 --> 01:32:16.010
We did. Don't you love me?

01:32:16.219 --> 01:32:19.222
I love the beautiful, bright,
sexy woman up on the screen.

01:32:19.305 --> 01:32:21.432
-He loves me.
-The girl I made movies with.

01:32:21.557 --> 01:32:25.853
That's not the real you, it's you pretending
to be real, which you're really good at.

01:32:25.937 --> 01:32:29.148
In real life, I think I'm with the real you,
but I'm not.

01:32:29.232 --> 01:32:30.942
I'd be with the real you here now...

01:32:31.025 --> 01:32:34.362
...not the real you from the movies.
I don't want to be with you.

01:32:34.445 --> 01:32:35.905
-Why not?
-I just explained it to you.

01:32:35.988 --> 01:32:38.116
-You did?
-I don't want to talk about it.

01:32:38.241 --> 01:32:40.535
-Not in front of these--
-Why not, Eddie?

01:32:40.618 --> 01:32:45.164
You're right. What could I have to say
to you that I don't have to say...

01:32:45.373 --> 01:32:48.793
...in front of 300 members
of the international press?

01:32:49.210 --> 01:32:52.505
I'll tell you why:
I'm in love with your sister.

01:32:55.466 --> 01:32:56.634
Kiki?

01:32:59.846 --> 01:33:01.973
-Is this some kind of joke?
-No.

01:33:02.974 --> 01:33:05.017
Kiki, could you get over here?

01:33:10.606 --> 01:33:12.734
-Why her?
-Oh, why not?

01:33:12.984 --> 01:33:16.487
Is it so unbelievable, unfathomable
that a man could love me?

01:33:16.738 --> 01:33:18.781
-Not now.
-I think now is the time.

01:33:18.865 --> 01:33:20.450
You just wait for me!

01:33:21.159 --> 01:33:22.410
Can I say something?

01:33:22.535 --> 01:33:23.953
-Yes.
-No!

01:33:24.245 --> 01:33:26.456
Okay, one nut at a time.

01:33:26.873 --> 01:33:29.000
You're my sister. I love you.

01:33:29.375 --> 01:33:34.714
And it's important to me that you know nothing happened
between me and Eddie until last night.

01:33:35.131 --> 01:33:38.551
I somehow feel so much better
about you stealing my husband.

01:33:38.634 --> 01:33:41.387
Ex! Ex-husband.
And I didn't steal anything.

01:33:41.554 --> 01:33:45.892
You've been shacked up for the past year
with Ricky Ricardo.

01:33:49.812 --> 01:33:53.399
I am just tired of making excuses.

01:33:53.566 --> 01:33:55.693
I am done picking up dirty clothes.

01:33:55.902 --> 01:33:58.362
I am done pretending...

01:33:58.446 --> 01:34:00.907
...that your life is my whole life.

01:34:01.741 --> 01:34:03.534
I'm just.... I'm done.

01:34:03.701 --> 01:34:06.579
So what you're really worried about
is you, right?

01:34:07.997 --> 01:34:09.332
Yes.

01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:14.087
Well, I guess you're fired.

01:34:18.091 --> 01:34:19.842
Honey.

01:34:22.845 --> 01:34:26.432
You know all I care about
is your happiness.

01:34:26.682 --> 01:34:27.767
That's sweet--

01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:32.271
So, don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

01:34:36.609 --> 01:34:38.903
-You're unbelievable.
-Shut up.

01:34:39.529 --> 01:34:41.447
Next? What can I do for you?

01:34:41.531 --> 01:34:45.118
I know I shouldn't have said that
in front of everybody, but....

01:34:45.785 --> 01:34:48.329
For the last year, I've tried to find clarity.

01:34:48.413 --> 01:34:51.833
All of a sudden I am so clear it's ridiculous.

01:34:52.834 --> 01:34:54.460
I want to be with you.

01:34:54.627 --> 01:34:56.713
When did you make this decision?

01:34:57.046 --> 01:34:59.173
The moment I thought I'd lost you.

01:35:00.049 --> 01:35:01.968
-Damn it.
-What?

01:35:02.301 --> 01:35:04.679
That was good.

01:35:07.223 --> 01:35:11.394
No, this is crazy.
Eddie, this isn't going to work.

01:35:11.561 --> 01:35:12.895
Listen to me.

01:35:14.939 --> 01:35:16.524
I'm grateful for you.

01:35:18.192 --> 01:35:21.487
In all the world,
the thing I'm most grateful for...

01:35:21.654 --> 01:35:22.905
...is you.

01:35:26.242 --> 01:35:28.536
If that's a line from one of your movies--

01:35:28.661 --> 01:35:29.996
That one's mine.

01:35:33.458 --> 01:35:34.542
What do we do now?

01:35:34.667 --> 01:35:37.420
Traditionally, we kiss.

01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:38.755
Yeah?

01:35:49.766 --> 01:35:53.102
Give her some room. Thank you.
Step back, please.

01:35:53.936 --> 01:35:55.438
Easy.

01:35:56.939 --> 01:35:59.067
I'm on pain medication...

01:35:59.275 --> 01:36:02.779
...that makes me say things
I'd never say otherwise.

01:36:03.321 --> 01:36:05.990
Just to set the record perfectly straight...

01:36:06.282 --> 01:36:09.285
...Eddie and I never had
any plans to reconcile.

01:36:09.952 --> 01:36:10.953
And?

01:36:11.162 --> 01:36:13.790
And Hector is very well-endowed.

01:36:13.956 --> 01:36:17.877
Almost too well-endowed. You know?
I've had complaints. Literally.

01:36:23.925 --> 01:36:26.010
-What are you doing?
-Packing.

01:36:26.302 --> 01:36:28.971
-Let me help you with that.
-No, that's okay.

01:36:29.305 --> 01:36:32.016
That's.... No, really, folding!

01:36:32.183 --> 01:36:34.852
No arguments.
Let somebody help you for once.

01:36:38.564 --> 01:36:39.816
There you are.

01:36:40.691 --> 01:36:42.318
That was unbelievable.

01:36:42.485 --> 01:36:45.029
That was just amazing
That was like a movie with a stage show.

01:36:45.113 --> 01:36:48.324
If you all would tour with the film,
we'd make a fortune.

01:36:48.408 --> 01:36:50.952
And your sister, Kiki, she's unbelievable.

01:36:51.077 --> 01:36:52.578
This is really remarkable.

01:36:52.662 --> 01:36:56.916
The entire country has voted her
off the island but, no! She's back!

01:36:56.999 --> 01:36:58.918
I've never seen anything like it.

01:36:59.001 --> 01:37:03.089
They like the movie. The press actually likes this crazy movie!
They call it The Blair Bitch Project!

01:37:03.256 --> 01:37:06.426
But the best news is you two.
Do you want to have a drink or something?

01:37:06.592 --> 01:37:08.594
-We're on our way out.
-Where you going?

01:37:08.678 --> 01:37:09.762
We don't know.
Isn't that great?

01:37:09.887 --> 01:37:13.808
Once in a while, good things happen.
All right, I'll see you.

01:37:13.891 --> 01:37:17.019
There's a car waiting,
you won't have to deal with the press.

01:37:17.103 --> 01:37:19.105
But I'll need you! We got a lot to do!

01:37:19.188 --> 01:37:20.898
This one's going to work!

01:37:40.585 --> 01:37:41.753
Hi.

01:37:42.045 --> 01:37:44.130
Can I explain why I didn't call?
