00:02.915 --> 00:04.874
Previously onMom...Oh, my God. What happened?!

00:04.961 --> 00:07.398
I threw my back out really bad.

00:07.485 --> 00:08.660
How?

00:08.747 --> 00:09.922
I was taking a shower,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.621
I bent down to pick up the soap.

00:12.708 --> 00:13.796
And?

00:13.883 --> 00:15.624
That'’s it!

00:15.711 --> 00:16.712
Marjorie?

00:16.799 --> 00:17.974
Here, talk to Bonnie.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.238
Yeah, hey, listen.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.327
Um, I'’m at the clinic.
I hurt my back.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.329
Doctor wants to give
me pain pills.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.462
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.204
She wants to
talk to you.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.206
Hi.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.121
No, she'’s not faking.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.515
Okay. It'’s 11:00.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.735
No more until
3:00 a.m.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.258
Assuming I'’m in pain.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.260
Exactly. You might
not even need it.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.045
Look at us,
being responsible with drugs.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.698
Right? "Take as directed."

00:46.785 --> 00:49.005
It'’s hilarious.
[chuckles]

00:49.092 --> 00:51.355
Where'’s your mother?

00:51.442 --> 00:54.228
Um, out for the evening. Why?

00:54.315 --> 00:57.013
She stole three
of my cat'’s tranquilizers.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.407
What? That'’s impossible.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.017
I just refilled
his prescription.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.585
I know exactly how many
were in here.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.849
Maybe your cat
has a drug problem.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.689
[phone vibrating]

01:23.344 --> 01:25.433
Hello?

01:25.520 --> 01:26.869
BONNIE:
Christy.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.871
Where are you?

01:28.958 --> 01:31.787
Uh... uh...

01:31.874 --> 01:33.484
I'’m in jail.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.182
Oh, God.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.661
Are you okay?

01:36.748 --> 01:39.664
Yeah. I just got a D.U.I.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.667
Can you come bail me out?

01:42.754 --> 01:45.975
You know what, I'’ll come...
get you in the morning.

01:46.062 --> 01:49.370
What?
You'’re gonna leave me here?

01:49.457 --> 01:51.415
Yeah. I am, Mom.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.025
Christy, don'’t you da...

02:02.383 --> 02:04.254
[engine starts]

02:12.262 --> 02:14.656
I am so mad at you!I am so mad at you!

02:14.743 --> 02:16.440
You'’re mad at me?!You'’re mad at me?!

02:16.527 --> 02:18.138
Yes!
Yes!

02:18.225 --> 02:21.489
All right, this is
stupid. You go first.

02:21.576 --> 02:24.318
How could you let me spend
a night in jail?

02:24.405 --> 02:26.972
How could you lie to me
about getting loaded again?

02:27.059 --> 02:29.932
It'’s not my fault. I was
prescribed those painkillers.

02:30.019 --> 02:32.326
I am the victim here.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.764
How'’d you blow a one-one
on the Breathalyzer?
Easy!

02:35.851 --> 02:38.245
I was drinking to forget
I was hooked on painkillers!

02:38.332 --> 02:40.508
All right.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.206
I am gonna say just
one more thing.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.513
As one alcoholic to
another, I will support you

02:45.600 --> 02:47.471
if you want to
get sober again.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.343
Thank you. I appreciate...Let me finish.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.040
But as your daughter--

02:51.127 --> 02:54.130
and I say this with
nothing but love--

02:54.217 --> 02:55.566
you are dead to me.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.135
Okay. Can I say something?

02:59.222 --> 03:01.050
Sure.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.312
First of all...

03:02.399 --> 03:04.358
Lies!

03:08.623 --> 03:11.887
At some point, we got to get
my car out of the impound lot.

03:11.974 --> 03:14.542
Fat lot of good it'’ll do you
without a driver'’s license,

03:14.629 --> 03:16.587
you stupid dumb-ass.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.548
Oh, hell no.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.333
We were so worried about you.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.813
Poor baby.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.989
Thank God you'’re okay!

03:27.076 --> 03:29.600
Christy, get in here.

03:29.687 --> 03:33.169
Oh, you don'’t want me anywhere
near her rib cage right now.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.519
All right.

03:35.606 --> 03:38.218
Bonnie, you have
a choice to make.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.220
You can either let us help you
get sober,

03:40.307 --> 03:43.832
or you can keep drinking and
using and end up back in jail,

03:43.919 --> 03:46.835
a hospital or an early grave.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.015
Well?

03:53.102 --> 03:55.322
I'’m thinking.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.776
I want to get sober again.

04:16.038 --> 04:18.779
I-I really do.Great.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.522
Now, you know, withdrawal from
painkillers can be challenging,

04:21.608 --> 04:25.395
but we'’re here to support you
and make it as easy as possible.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.136
'’Cause God knows
we want it to be easy.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.660
Christy.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.619
Sorry. I'’m not a fan.

04:33.708 --> 04:37.233
Wendy'’s a registered nurse,
so she can check your vitals,

04:37.320 --> 04:38.887
make sure you'’re
staying hydrated.

04:38.974 --> 04:40.584
I didn'’t know
you were a nurse.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.935
I talk about it all the time
at meetings.

04:44.022 --> 04:47.199
Yeah, I-I don'’t really listen
to other people'’s shares.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.114
Well, I am.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.856
And just so you know,
if you start to convulse,

04:51.943 --> 04:53.597
I can give you a light sedative.

04:53.684 --> 04:55.120
Now, that I heard.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.689
I offered to pay for
you to spend a month

04:58.776 --> 05:01.692
at my rehab in Malibu,
but Christy said no.

05:01.779 --> 05:04.521
What a hateful thing to do.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.914
Thanks.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.395
That'’s what I was going for.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.614
Let'’s get you
into some clean clothes.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.312
Yeah, good idea.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.836
Put a fresh coat of paint
on that turd.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.754
Why are you so angry?

05:19.841 --> 05:20.972
You'’re kidding, right?

05:21.059 --> 05:23.018
She screws up,

05:23.105 --> 05:25.107
and everyone'’s treating her
like it'’s her birthday.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.675
Ooh, that reminds me.
I got her a cake.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.028
Be right back.
I got to pee.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.428
[exhales]

05:53.701 --> 05:56.443
Is this really
necessary?

05:56.530 --> 05:58.445
It is. Don'’t want you
to have a stroke

05:58.532 --> 06:00.621
or a massive heart attack
while you'’re detoxing.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.972
Terrific. Sobriety'’s
gonna kill me.

06:04.059 --> 06:06.670
How'’s her blood pressure?

06:06.757 --> 06:08.019
Great.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.369
[quietly]:
I'’ll tell you later.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.980
Okay, Bonnie,

06:12.067 --> 06:13.460
pick what movie
you want to watch.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.678
I brought
Steel Magnolias,

06:14.765 --> 06:16.463
Fried Green Tomatoes

06:16.550 --> 06:18.290
and Sisterhoodof
the Traveling Pants.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.510
[whispers]: Traveling Pants,
Traveling Pants.

06:20.597 --> 06:23.731
Wait, why does the drug addict
get to pick?

06:23.818 --> 06:26.995
Because when one of us stumbles,
we surround them with love.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.345
Oh.
[blows raspberry]

06:29.432 --> 06:31.173
Why don'’t you
make yourself useful

06:31.260 --> 06:33.349
and take care
of some of your mom'’s chores.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.003
Maybe I don'’t want to be useful.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.352
It'’s okay.
She doesn'’t have to.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.136
Damn right, I don'’t have to.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.616
The to-do list
is on the fridge.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.749
I know where it is!

06:41.836 --> 06:44.839
Let'’s watch Steel Magnolias.
I'’ve never seen that before.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.536
Julia Roberts dies.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.282
Thanks for coming with me.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.241
Sure. It'’s fun
doing chores.

06:56.328 --> 06:59.506
Feels like I'’m
working on a ranch.

06:59.593 --> 07:03.161
Okay, first thing we have to do
is clear out the lint traps.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.162
Great.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.250
What'’s that?

07:06.382 --> 07:08.993
In the dryer. See?

07:09.080 --> 07:12.083
Ew, looks like the
dryer'’s belly button.

07:12.170 --> 07:15.870
I'’ll take care of it.
You relax.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.915
[groans]

07:18.002 --> 07:21.179
This is ridiculous.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.660
I have to do her work
while she gets coddled.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.880
Were you this angry with me
when I relapsed?

07:25.967 --> 07:27.185
Of course not.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.057
Well, what'’s the difference?

07:29.144 --> 07:31.668
You haven'’t been disappointing
me since I was born.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.409
Yeah, well,

07:33.496 --> 07:34.976
at least
you still have a mother.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.544
Mine died when I was 16.

07:37.631 --> 07:40.547
Oh. Jill, I-I didn'’t know.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.549
How'’d she die?

07:42.636 --> 07:44.202
She battled depression
her whole life,

07:44.289 --> 07:46.422
and then one day
she just gave up,

07:46.509 --> 07:48.903
drove her little red Ferrari
into the garage,

07:48.990 --> 07:52.384
closed the door, and the
carbon monoxide did the rest.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.995
Oh, God.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.084
Yeah.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.956
It was really hard
to drive that car after that.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.699
I'’ll... bet.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.614
But, you know,

08:04.701 --> 08:07.312
it was a Ferrari,
so I muscled through.

08:08.444 --> 08:09.880
[loud snap]

08:09.967 --> 08:11.752
[rat squeaking]Oh, no.

08:11.839 --> 08:12.883
What'’s that?

08:12.970 --> 08:14.929
Ugh, rat trap.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.408
Damn it.
It'’s still alive.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.367
What are we gonna do?

08:18.454 --> 08:21.805
I don'’t know. I hate to
see the poor thing suffer.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.633
All right. Stand back.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.592
What?Just move aside.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.599
Holy crap!

08:32.686 --> 08:35.427
Got him.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.779
You carry a gun?

08:38.866 --> 08:41.782
Oh. This isn'’t really a gun.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.741
This is a gun.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.266
[instrumental music playing]

08:50.399 --> 08:53.271
I don'’t get this movie.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.143
What'’s not to get?

08:55.230 --> 08:59.669
They'’re strong like steel
but soft like magnolias.

08:59.756 --> 09:02.977
Okay, now I get it.
I just hate it.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.984
How you doing?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.464
Ugh, I hope to God
this is my bottom.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.249
It'’s up to you.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.512
Your bottom'’s
when you decide to stop digging.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.820
Or when I beat you to death
with my shovel.

09:19.907 --> 09:23.475
Boy, I really did it
this time, didn'’t I?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.130
[sighs]
Yep.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.306
Christy hates me.

09:28.393 --> 09:29.438
Give her time.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.005
How much time?

09:31.092 --> 09:33.007
I don'’t know.
Maybe a year or two

09:33.094 --> 09:35.139
if you don'’t do
anything else stupid.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.447
You'’re such a comfort.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.712
Let'’s just get you through
this part right now.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.976
We'’ll deal with you
and Christy later.

09:46.063 --> 09:48.326
Thank you
for being so kind to me.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.198
You'’re welcome.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.375
Crazy old ladies were
kind to me when I was new.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.856
I just don'’t feel
like I deserve it.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.249
[chuckles]
Bonnie,

09:58.336 --> 10:02.340
if people like us got what we
deserve, we'’d all be dead.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.083
Again, such a comfort.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.826
[instrumental music playing]

10:09.913 --> 10:11.523
[sobbing]

10:11.611 --> 10:13.830
For God'’s sake,
they'’re just having dinner.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.226
Hey.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.532
Hey. How'’d it go?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.186
Fine.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.537
Where'’s my mother?

10:25.625 --> 10:26.843
She'’s upstairs.

10:26.930 --> 10:27.931
How'’s she doing?

10:28.018 --> 10:29.106
Pretty bad.

10:29.193 --> 10:32.066
Oh, good, I want to go see.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.764
Just a head'’s up:
don'’t piss off Jill.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.380
Hi.

10:44.469 --> 10:45.645
Hey.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.039
Pretty rough, huh?

10:49.126 --> 10:50.780
Awful.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.000
Sweet.

10:54.828 --> 10:55.698
You need anything?

10:56.873 --> 10:58.048
Really?

10:58.135 --> 10:59.528
Sure.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.878
I haven'’t washed my hair
for days.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.924
Come on into the bathroom.

11:04.011 --> 11:04.968
Thanks.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.624
You see my funny note
in the pill bottle?

11:08.711 --> 11:10.844
Yeah, I left you
a funny response.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.197
Brought you more tea.

11:16.284 --> 11:18.678
[water running]

11:20.157 --> 11:22.116
Christy!

11:22.203 --> 11:24.553
She has to be punished!

11:26.511 --> 11:28.775
Here'’s the grocery list.
Take your time.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.733
It would'’ve grown back!
Go.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.221
Find everything you need?

11:40.308 --> 11:41.396
Yeah.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.702
Having a good day?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.529
You bet.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.532
Ooh, candles, bubble bath,
ice cream--

11:47.619 --> 11:50.057
someone'’s spoiling themselves.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.362
Actually it'’s for my mom.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.103
Aw.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.192
She'’s a drug addict
who just got out of jail.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.673
Aw.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.546
Chunky Monkey--
that'’s kind of my addiction.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.070
I'’m a Chunky Monkey junkie.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.114
[laughs]

12:04.201 --> 12:05.768
Yeah, funny.

12:05.855 --> 12:06.943
[laughs]

12:07.030 --> 12:08.597
What'’s your name? Kathy?

12:08.684 --> 12:11.252
Let me tell you
something, Kathy.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.951
This world rewards bad people.
I don'’t know why.

12:15.038 --> 12:18.041
Maybe God'’s a practical joker,
maybe there is no God,

12:18.128 --> 12:21.218
maybe life is just about
getting boned every day

12:21.305 --> 12:24.482
by an angry gorilla
until you die.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.312
Okeydokey.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.752
Any coupons?

12:32.839 --> 12:36.451
Actually, yeah, hold on.

12:36.538 --> 12:39.323
Hi, I'’m Marjorie
and I'’m an alcoholic.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.151
OTHERS:
Hi, Marjorie.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.980
Well, I'’ve been going
through a rough patch.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.896
This last round of chemo
really knocked me out.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.506
I haven'’t had any energy,

12:48.593 --> 12:50.639
and every part of my body
just hurts.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.597
Hold that thought.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.428
[retching]

12:57.515 --> 12:59.169
But you know what?

12:59.256 --> 13:01.650
I'’ll take cancer
over trying to get sober again.

13:01.737 --> 13:04.000
Bonnie, are you okay?

13:04.087 --> 13:06.960
Never better.
[retches]

13:07.047 --> 13:08.831
[clicks tongue]

13:08.918 --> 13:10.920
That lucky duck'’s
gonna lose so much weight.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.143
Poor thing,
come on and lie down.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.797
Come on, let'’s
get you all cozy.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.973
Yeah. Yeah.
Drink this.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.845
You'’re gonna be okay.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.804
You'’re a steel magnolia.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.461
Hey...

13:32.463 --> 13:34.335
Are you kidding me?

13:34.422 --> 13:36.554
She'’s having
a hard time.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.948
Sick popes don'’t get
this much attention.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.646
Christy, wait.

13:41.733 --> 13:42.822
What?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.475
I get that you'’re angry.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.434
Oh, I am way
past angry.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.828
What do you want to do? You want
to just throw your mother away?

13:48.915 --> 13:51.134
Yes. And then I want to go
to the new mommy store

13:51.221 --> 13:53.484
and get one that works.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.530
Come on back inside.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.098
I better not.
I know where Jill'’s gun is.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.361
Where are you going?

14:00.448 --> 14:02.450
To my happy place.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.979
Happy place, my ass.

14:11.328 --> 14:12.460
Cocktails?

14:12.547 --> 14:14.114
Um...

14:14.201 --> 14:15.332
Aw, just keep walking.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.161
Would you like a card?

14:18.248 --> 14:19.641
What do you think, Tracy?

14:19.728 --> 14:21.469
I got 16 against a ten.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.774
Book says take a card.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.428
[mocking]:
"Book says take a card."

14:24.515 --> 14:25.429
Hit me.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.261
And there it is.

14:31.348 --> 14:34.264
Would you like the rest of these
or should we play one more hand?

14:44.361 --> 14:46.189
Okay, okay,
I can work with that.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.495
Blackjack.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.497
I hate my mother!

14:55.503 --> 14:57.635
WOMAN:
Hey. Psst.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.161
You done with this stupidity?

15:01.248 --> 15:02.162
What?

15:02.249 --> 15:04.033
Come on, get up.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.035
Let'’s go down to the park,
score an eight ball.

15:06.122 --> 15:07.558
Uh, I can'’t.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.256
I-I'’m trying to quit.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.301
Oh, please,
you'’re no quitter.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.216
Besides, it'’ll be
different this time.

15:13.303 --> 15:17.525
From now on, we'’ll only
get high on the weekends.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.744
Excuse me.

15:19.831 --> 15:23.400
No one'’s going to be
snorting any fat rails

15:23.487 --> 15:25.968
while I'’m here.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.188
Oh, great.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.452
Take the tooth, leave a quarter,
and get out of here.

15:31.539 --> 15:34.063
Settle down, camel toe.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.938
For the record,
I am all that is good

15:39.025 --> 15:41.462
about this wonderful woman.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.986
Oh, yeah?
Well, if it wasn'’t for me,

15:44.073 --> 15:45.945
she'’d have never survived
being a foster kid.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.512
I was always
looking out for her.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.819
[scoffs] You'’re the reason she
kept getting beat up in school.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.343
That is true.

15:53.430 --> 15:56.042
Hush, darling.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.870
I was the reason she
reconciled with her daughter.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.438
I'’m the reason
she had a daughter.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.179
At age 17.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.790
Oh, yeah,
here comes the slut-shaming.

16:05.877 --> 16:09.794
I'’ve asked you not to use
that kind of language around me.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.318
Slut.Family.

16:11.405 --> 16:12.536
Slut.Friendship.

16:12.623 --> 16:13.624
Slut.
Trust.

16:13.711 --> 16:14.799
Slut.Love.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.453
Slut.Understanding.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.542
Slut.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.980
Okay, everybody just quiet down
for a minute.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.111
Hugs.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.505
Stop it.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.333
I-I feel like my head'’s
gonna explode.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.335
That'’s because
you'’re sober, dummy.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.206
You'’re not a dummy.

16:30.293 --> 16:34.645
You'’re a very smart girl
with a promising future.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.038
She'’s got no future.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.822
Not if she listens to you.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.173
Would everybody just shut up.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.958
I... I can'’t think.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.004
You'’re going down.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.745
Talk to the wand.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.619
BONNIE: The two of you
are driving me crazy!

16:51.706 --> 16:54.883
Just leave me alone!Mm. Arguing with people
who aren'’t there.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.103
Brings you back,
doesn'’t it?

16:58.843 --> 17:00.889
When I was detoxing,
I remember having

17:00.976 --> 17:02.456
a screaming fight
with my dead mother.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.763
Stewardess made me
get off the plane in Denver.

17:09.157 --> 17:11.769
I don'’t know what to do.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.076
I don'’t know if I should
keep getting loaded...

17:15.425 --> 17:17.079
...if I should get sober. I...

17:18.124 --> 17:19.690
I give up. I...

17:19.777 --> 17:22.693
Somebody help me, please,
God, anybody!

17:22.780 --> 17:24.694
[toilet flushes]

17:26.306 --> 17:28.743
Ladies, I got this.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.223
But I was just...

17:30.310 --> 17:31.963
Bup-bup-bup.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.186
I don'’t know why I can'’t stay.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.546
It'’s okay.

17:49.633 --> 17:50.852
We can do this.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.510
Hi, I'’m Christy,
and I'’m an alcoholic.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.294
OTHERS:
Hi, Christy.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.209
[sighs]

18:00.296 --> 18:02.472
I wasn'’t planning on
going to a meeting tonight,

18:02.559 --> 18:05.649
but I'’m broke
and I wanted a cup of coffee.

18:07.651 --> 18:11.394
Anyway, what'’s going on with me?

18:13.875 --> 18:17.531
Okay, well, my mom
relapsed on painkillers.

18:19.359 --> 18:22.275
And I really don'’t know
what to do about it,

18:22.362 --> 18:24.451
except get angry at her.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.235
Which totally isn'’t helping,

18:26.322 --> 18:29.934
but I guess it'’s better than
being scared.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.329
Hmm.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.334
When I was a kid,
I was scared all the time.

18:38.421 --> 18:41.120
'’Cause, you know,
if my mom wasn'’t okay,

18:41.207 --> 18:44.340
I wasn'’t okay.

18:44.427 --> 18:48.170
But I'’m not a kid anymore,
and...

18:48.257 --> 18:52.653
I guess, if I'’m sober...

18:52.740 --> 18:55.917
I'’m okay,
no matter what she does.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.183
Hot damn.

19:01.270 --> 19:04.143
I wish I came here
before I lost $800.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.723
Hey.

19:19.810 --> 19:23.162
Hey. How you feeling?

19:24.337 --> 19:26.208
Better.

19:26.295 --> 19:29.646
Yeah, me, too.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.214
What'’s bothering you?

19:32.301 --> 19:34.390
Seriously?

19:34.477 --> 19:36.827
Oh. Yeah.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.655
Sorry.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.486
Go back to sleep.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.014
Hey, who left
the seat up?
