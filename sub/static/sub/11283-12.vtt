WEBVTT

00:06.741 --> 00:08.574
What am I supposed
to do with you?

00:08.576 --> 00:10.309
Alex...

00:10.311 --> 00:13.412
We were supposed to spend our
whole lives together.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.247
I know.

00:15.249 --> 00:19.551
(sirens wailing)

00:22.490 --> 00:25.090
I'm sorry.
They made me.

00:25.092 --> 00:28.227
I didn't
have a choice.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.362
(hammer clicks)

00:35.202 --> 00:38.370
(slow electronica playing)

00:45.179 --> 00:49.515
¶ Let me feel you... ¶

00:50.584 --> 00:52.317
You...

00:52.319 --> 00:53.452
You...

00:53.454 --> 00:55.120
Are...

00:55.122 --> 00:56.188
Are...

00:56.190 --> 00:57.189
Very...

00:57.191 --> 01:00.392
Very, unbelievably...

01:01.128 --> 01:04.263
Unbelievably...

01:04.265 --> 01:07.332
Overwhelmingly...

01:08.269 --> 01:10.536
I can't do it.

01:12.339 --> 01:15.074
¶ ¶

01:29.290 --> 01:31.156
(dance music playing)

01:31.158 --> 01:31.824
(keypad beeping)

01:36.230 --> 01:37.463
I got great news.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.298
What?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.100
That guy, the guy
from Arizona?
Mm-hmm.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.569
I didn't want to tell you until
it was a done deal, but

01:43.571 --> 01:45.237
tonight, 2:00 a.m.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.238
Tonight?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.406
VIP lounge.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.674
He's coming in
through the side door,

01:48.676 --> 01:50.142
he does not
get a tour,

01:50.144 --> 01:51.443
and I want you
to serve him.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.513
No one else in
or out. Got it?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.448
Except for my
man Thomas.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.516
Seriously?

01:57.518 --> 01:58.750
(imitates jet engine)

01:58.752 --> 02:00.419
THOMAS:
Just like that?
Flying him in.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.487
Nice! Whoo!

02:01.489 --> 02:03.455
(laughing)
Hey, come here.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.358
Yeah!
This is the beginning
of our future.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.127
Hey, baby...

02:10.264 --> 02:11.463
Hey...

02:11.465 --> 02:13.599
you don't need to do this.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.735
You worry too much.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.540
It's go time, baby!

02:21.542 --> 02:23.375
(laughs)

02:32.686 --> 02:34.353
(dialing)

02:34.355 --> 02:36.622
(stops dialing)

02:39.193 --> 02:40.826
(finishes dialing)

02:40.828 --> 02:42.895
(line ringing)

02:44.298 --> 02:46.365
It's Jackie.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.268
It's tonight.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.921
Quite the standoff.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.490
You using intimidation tactics
to make the food come out,

03:11.492 --> 03:13.692
or are you waiting for
backup before you go in?

03:13.694 --> 03:14.726
WORDY:
There he is.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.761
There you go, buddy.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.229
All yours.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.864
What's this?
I told you,

03:18.866 --> 03:21.300
it's the stuff from
the girls for the baby.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.467
Keep whatever you like.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.802
I don't think we're
going for number four.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.671
You guys got a name yet?

03:26.640 --> 03:27.973
No.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.876
That's a nice color.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.311
Briefing room.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.545
Okay, all right, thanks.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.646
Yep.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.481
They're coming in.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.250
You remember
Detective
Merry Danner

03:38.252 --> 03:39.518
from Financial
Crimes?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.486
Merry, good to see you again.
No, it's not.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.655
I'm springing this
on you guys last minute.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.325
We take it how it comes.
I appreciate that.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.328
Okay, we've had our
electronic eye on this man,

03:49.330 --> 03:50.896
Alexander Carson, for some time.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.332
Mr. Carson is a clearing house

03:53.334 --> 03:54.900
for stolen credit card
information.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.769
<i> He's got a network of skimmers</i>
<i> in several cities--</i>

03:57.771 --> 03:59.504
<i> five-star restaurants,</i>
<i> clothing boutiques--</i>

03:59.506 --> 04:02.241
<i> and his people</i>
<i> only skim the cream:</i>

04:02.243 --> 04:03.642
<i> big spenders</i>
<i> on high-limit cards.</i>

04:03.644 --> 04:05.410
<i> When they've loaded a device</i>

04:05.412 --> 04:07.312
<i> with information</i>
<i> from dozens of cards,</i>

04:07.314 --> 04:08.447
<i> they return it</i>
<i> to Carson's network,</i>

04:08.449 --> 04:09.448
<i> who upload the information--</i>

04:09.450 --> 04:11.550
<i> card number, holder's name,</i>

04:11.552 --> 04:12.818
<i> expiry date,</i>

04:12.820 --> 04:14.820
<i> everything in</i>
<i> the magnetic strip.</i>

04:14.822 --> 04:17.956
<i> Then they either run blank</i>
<i> stock through a card encoder</i>

04:17.958 --> 04:19.358
<i> to create a clone card,</i>

04:19.360 --> 04:20.792
<i> or... more recently,</i>

04:20.794 --> 04:22.794
<i> Mr. Carson has been packaging,</i>

04:22.796 --> 04:24.896
bundling data
from thousands of cards

04:24.898 --> 04:26.999
and then auctioning the packet
to the highest bidder

04:27.001 --> 04:28.400
at illegal Web auctions.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.668
JULES:
How much money

04:29.670 --> 04:31.303
are we talking here?
Typically,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.438
information from one card
is worth ten, 20 dollars.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.340
Carson's been getting up to $50.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.908
That difference is
worth millions.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.810
Okay, so why the sudden move?

04:38.812 --> 04:41.013
Mr. Carson is stepping up
to the next level.

04:41.015 --> 04:44.016
<i> Meet the big fish:</i>
<i> Mark Griffin.</i>

04:44.018 --> 04:46.518
<i> Slippery fingers</i>
<i> in every corner of data theft.</i>

04:46.520 --> 04:49.354
<i> Mr. Griffin is so impressed</i>
<i> with Carson's product,</i>

04:49.356 --> 04:51.907
<i> he wants it all for himself.</i>

04:51.908 --> 04:54.459
<i> So they've agreed</i>
<i> to a very rare face-to-face.</i>

04:54.461 --> 04:56.862
Okay, let me ask you this,
who's the primary target?

04:56.864 --> 04:58.630
Is it Carson or is it Griffin?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.499
Two birds with one stone.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.667
And the meet's in...

05:01.669 --> 05:03.235
just under two hours.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.802
Well, we can handle
any last-minute TAC plans.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.188
Just tell us where.

05:06.189 --> 05:07.572
Subterranean Club,
owned by Carson.

05:07.574 --> 05:10.709
Old shoe factory converted
into a multilevel nightclub.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.544
Okay, how reliable
is your intel here?

05:12.546 --> 05:14.880
Very. We have
a C.I. inside

05:14.882 --> 05:17.482
close to Carson-- Jackie Emery.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.419
We caught her skimming in the
club a couple of months back.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.688
I.D. fraud,
credit card fraud,

05:22.690 --> 05:25.324
computer fraud.
I don't touch the computers.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.625
I don't even know
where they are.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.027
Still, when I put
those charges

05:29.029 --> 05:31.430
before a judge next to your
previous drug convictions...

05:31.432 --> 05:33.666
It was just pot.
...I wind up thinking the

05:33.667 --> 05:35.901
sentence will be pretty close to
the 15-year max.
If you think there's

05:35.903 --> 05:38.970
any way in hell that I am gonna
turn on the man I love...

05:38.972 --> 05:40.472
The man you love
made you do this.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.940
He didn't make me do anything.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.876
What he did was show me
that you don't just sit here

05:44.878 --> 05:47.612
and take what
life throws at you.

05:47.614 --> 05:51.350
Do you have any idea who I was
before I met him?

05:51.352 --> 05:52.818
You owe him?

05:52.820 --> 05:55.487
I love him.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.656
Do you get the difference?

05:57.658 --> 05:59.591
Yeah.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.460
I do.

06:01.462 --> 06:06.531
Jackie, we're gonna get
him with or without you...

06:06.533 --> 06:08.567
but if you help us...

06:08.569 --> 06:10.135
maybe we can talk

06:10.137 --> 06:12.938
about making things
a little easier for Alex, too.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.676
Wait a second, so she's in
a relationship with this guy?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.578
You sure we can trust her?

06:19.580 --> 06:22.381
I had the same doubts, but
she's fed us good information,

06:22.383 --> 06:24.516
filled in a lot of gaps,
and we wouldn't know

06:24.518 --> 06:26.685
about the Griffin meet
without her.
Okay. How's it going down?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.653
A face-to-face
in the club's VIP lounge.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.921
Two entrances.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.456
The one from
the back

06:31.458 --> 06:33.525
has two bouncers, one armed.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.593
We'll need to get to them
before they can alert Carson.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.829
It's a Saturday night-- there's
gonna be a lot of civilians.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.865
We've got that covered.
Jackie's agreed to lock

06:39.866 --> 06:41.900
that door to the
VIP lounge from inside the club.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.069
So we go in the back door
and we got him trapped.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.104
I don't want any chance of this
spilling out into the club.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.473
So, Spike and Sam,
you work from inside.

06:48.475 --> 06:49.541
Plain club clothes?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.676
Just two guys out
on the town, yeah.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.945
We've got my people, too.
Okay, your people

06:53.947 --> 06:57.549
need to stay invisible
till we are inside and secure.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.718
Of course.
But I'd like to be close.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.987
Yes. We can use your help.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.722
WINNIE:
Sorry.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.590
Somebody's here
from the A.G.'s office.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.591
My warrants.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.093
How's that for cutting it close?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.661
That's what we do.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.177
(dance music playing)

07:25.179 --> 07:27.746
Why don't you go
get yourself a drink?

07:29.716 --> 07:30.949
Hey.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.451
They're here.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.986
Hey, baby.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.959
How do I look?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.494
You look fine.

07:42.496 --> 07:43.728
Fine? Baby...

07:43.730 --> 07:45.664
Come on, this is
our future here.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.699
Okay, you look...
you look good.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.733
Mm-hmm?

07:48.735 --> 07:51.236
You look good.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.672
(whispers):
I love you.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.683
Watch the door.
Mm-hmm.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.252
Two Cokes; bourbon, rocks;

08:07.254 --> 08:09.754
a glass of merlot;
and a bottle of champagne

08:09.756 --> 08:11.623
on ice.
Already done.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.833
Mr. Griffin...

08:21.835 --> 08:24.636
I presume.
You presume right.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.723
You always try to put

08:27.724 --> 08:29.741
a face to the name on the
screen in this business,

08:29.743 --> 08:30.976
but you're usually wrong.

08:30.978 --> 08:34.546
That's because most
of the names are fake.

08:35.983 --> 08:39.718
¶ ¶

08:39.720 --> 08:42.287
Britt, uh, cover me
while I do this, okay?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.688
Okay.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.908
She's heading
into the VIP.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.714
Hey, boys.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.216
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Sorry.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.019
Private entrance,
private function.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.855
Come on, I'd make
a great addition to any party.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.823
No, no, no,
listen, stay...
Don't you touch me.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.859
Get your hands off me!

09:20.861 --> 09:22.694
Get your hands off me!
Is this the way

09:22.696 --> 09:25.564
to touch a woman? Huh?
Right here, buddy. Shh!

09:25.566 --> 09:27.198
Don't say a word,
don't say a word.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.300
Guys, over here.
Give me your hand.

09:28.302 --> 09:29.901
Take 'em to your people.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.936
All right.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.070
Good luck.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.243
Loud and aggressive, Eddie?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.680
Eddie?

09:42.983 --> 09:45.250
Yeah. In position.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.655
Spike, standing by.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.625
Awaiting confirmation
of locked door.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.064
10,000 valid cards on here.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.599
It's amazing, eh?

10:00.601 --> 10:02.901
If they're as good
as the last batch, yeah.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.970
Why don't you make
some transactions and see?

10:09.309 --> 10:11.876
(rapid clicking)

10:14.081 --> 10:15.747
(beeping)

10:15.749 --> 10:17.082
Good.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.717
(beeping)

10:18.719 --> 10:19.884
WOMAN:
Good.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.219
(beeping)
Good.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.655
Eh, that's enough.
I trust this guy.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.357
You have my information?

10:25.359 --> 10:26.925
Caymans or Zurich?

10:26.927 --> 10:29.227
Caymans.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.965
¶ ¶

10:33.967 --> 10:35.900
Okay, we got the door locked.

10:35.902 --> 10:36.935
The subjects are contained.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.036
On my go.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.740
(beeping)

10:41.742 --> 10:42.741
Hold.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.842
Hold it, hold it.

10:43.844 --> 10:44.976
(beeping)
What are you doing?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.715
You locked the door.
Nobody in or out.

10:50.717 --> 10:53.918
That's why<i> I'm</i> here.
Well, you weren't here
when I got here.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.053
I was right over there.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.223
What's going on?
Did she lock the door?

10:58.959 --> 10:59.958
Did she,

10:59.960 --> 11:01.626
or didn't she?

11:01.627 --> 11:03.293
She did-- then she
started talking to some guy.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.796
Okay, what does that mean?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.197
We saw her lock the door.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.267
Ed.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.902
Your call, boss.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.138
Okay, do it.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.773
Count it down.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.108
Verify the transaction?

11:17.110 --> 11:19.277
Three... two...

11:20.814 --> 11:22.847
(indistinct shouting)

11:37.164 --> 11:38.963
Carson is at large in the club!

11:38.965 --> 11:40.298
Repeat, Carson is at large.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.833
We don't have Carson.

11:41.835 --> 11:44.436
The door wasn't locked,
we don't have Carson.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.844
Boss, the doors weren't locked.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.946
Detective Danner,
secure your perimeter.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.447
Carson's not
in custody.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.850
I repeat, Carson's
not in custody!

12:31.852 --> 12:35.520
¶ ¶

12:44.331 --> 12:45.830
Yo, bro,
what's going on?

12:45.832 --> 12:46.965
A bust-- SRU
in the lounge.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.032
What?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.271
All right,
we need a distraction.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.908
We pull a Pink Floyd and
then I'll light it up.
All right.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.017
ED:
Boss,

13:06.019 --> 13:07.886
we got too many
people in here.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.955
We're gonna have to sift
'em out one by one, Eddie.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.900
(music stops)

13:21.902 --> 13:23.234
(people grumbling)

13:24.838 --> 13:26.404
(gunshot)
(screaming)

13:29.075 --> 13:31.042
(gunshots)
Shots fired, shots fired.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.279
(screaming continues)

13:34.281 --> 13:36.114
No joy, can't see a shooter.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.983
We need lights,
we need to control this.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.985
Electrical room's in the
basement, southeast corner.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.587
ED:
Jules,

13:42.589 --> 13:44.455
with me, let's go now.
Careful, Eddie.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.391
Whoever threw that breaker
could still be down there.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.394
(clamoring)

13:49.396 --> 13:53.164
SAM: Police! Stay calm!
Everybody, this way!
Everybody, calm down, calm down.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.033
Go, get out of here!
Move, go, go!

13:55.035 --> 13:56.167
SAM:
Go, go, go, go!

13:56.169 --> 13:57.168
(gasps)

13:57.170 --> 13:58.169
Jackie, it's me.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.138
Oh, my God, Alex.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.172
We got to go.
Okay.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.440
We got to go.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.579
This is the police.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.081
Everyone, calm down.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.117
This is the police.

14:13.119 --> 14:16.621
Stay where you are,
stop moving now.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.523
Everybody move away
from the exits

14:18.525 --> 14:21.426
slow and steady
and everybody goes home.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.536
Wordy, you work
with Danner,

14:31.538 --> 14:33.104
create a containment area
at the main exit.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.006
We can't let
this guy slip away, okay?

14:35.008 --> 14:37.008
And hold
onto the staff, too.
Copy that.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.015
(dance music plays)

14:44.017 --> 14:47.652
Please turn the music off.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.153
The shots were a diversion.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.588
Shattered a light box.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.158
(Jackie groaning)

14:54.160 --> 14:55.260
Come on, up.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.096
Go, go.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.175
Damn it.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.012
They knew.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.346
They knew Griffin
was coming tonight.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.081
I know.
Somebody talked.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.483
CARSON:
They're probably only
watching the exit.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.951
Fire escape, this way.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.504
Hey, we got a snitch, Alex.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.056
I know, but what do you want
me to do about it now? Let's go.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.095
We saw her lock the door, boss.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.964
Yeah, or she pretended to.
Well, I'd say Danner's CI

15:32.966 --> 15:34.749
isn't on our side after all.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.533
The guy she was talking to
could have made her unlock it.
Well,

15:36.536 --> 15:38.536
where is she? We've searched
this place top to bottom.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.438
Okay, let's roll with it, guys,
we don't know what happened.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.223
Wordy?

15:42.224 --> 15:44.007
Wordy, any sign of Carson
or Jackie yet?

15:44.010 --> 15:45.126
Nothing yet.

15:45.127 --> 15:46.243
It looks like every exit
was covered.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.279
Okay, let the unis take care
of the exits.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.714
Come back inside,
bring Danner with you.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.616
Let's go see
what her big fish has to say.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.617
Copy that.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.585
Detective Danner,

15:54.587 --> 15:57.088
boss needs us
in the VIP.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.157
After you.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.200
You wrote a kill-switch macro,
didn't you?

16:09.202 --> 16:11.069
She scrubbed the hard drive
with a single keystroke.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.370
PARKER:
Can you get anything
out of it?

16:12.372 --> 16:13.972
Maybe, with some time.

16:13.974 --> 16:17.275
We can-- it's our investigation,
it's our evidence.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.210
Give it to her, Spike.
Eddie.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.278
Go ahead.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.113
All yours.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.715
Thank you.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.050
Keep smiling, Mr. Griffin.
You're on your way to jail.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.618
I'd like you
to speak to my lawyer.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.321
You can call him
from the station.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.323
Gentlemen.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.391
Keep walking.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.559
Spike.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.661
Copy that.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.162
I stand by my CI, Sergeant.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.064
She lost her nerve.
I don't believe that.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.399
We might be more objective.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.067
Objectivity
does not play here.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.335
Jackie told us
about the meet.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.004
She gave up Carson.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.538
You think he pegged
her as the snitch?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.639
He knows someone's been talking

16:48.641 --> 16:50.575
and he'll be looking
for payback.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.642
She could have run
on her own

16:51.644 --> 16:53.044
right after not locking
the door.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.779
We were watching
the exits.
Look,

16:54.780 --> 16:56.513
at least two people breached
your perimeter tonight.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.483
Okay, Eddie.
Boss, come on.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.085
I am and will be responsible
for my CI and this bust.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.437
All right.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.788
So if she's
with Carson...

17:03.790 --> 17:06.391
Yeah, we need to find her.

17:07.327 --> 17:11.095
(tires screeching)

17:15.535 --> 17:17.201
Baby, baby, calm down,
baby, calm down.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.403
Don't tell me to calm down!

17:19.439 --> 17:20.705
Don't!

17:20.707 --> 17:22.640
Do not get out
of the car.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.247
You think I'm the informant?

17:29.249 --> 17:32.116
Are you?
No.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.217
Then why'd you lock the door?

17:33.219 --> 17:34.519
JACKIE:
I told you, I didn't know

17:34.521 --> 17:35.553
you were watching the door.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.688
Alex said no one in, no one out.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.944
The cops came in
from the street.

17:42.945 --> 17:44.528
Well, where else are they
supposed to come in from?

17:44.531 --> 17:47.265
Right, pretty convenient.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.067
You think it's me?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.268
You go tell him.

17:50.270 --> 17:50.768
(screams)

17:50.770 --> 17:52.503
Go tell him.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.505
(smashing)

17:54.507 --> 17:56.641
(car door opens,
Carson grunts)

17:57.610 --> 17:59.844
Baby.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.780
It's okay, it's okay.

18:02.782 --> 18:03.781
It's okay.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.784
It is okay.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.786
Okay, you are fine.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.488
It's okay.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.523
Okay, you're okay.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.158
You're okay.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.493
(kissing)

18:15.495 --> 18:16.694
You're okay.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.231
BRITT:
<i> They're in love.</i>

18:20.233 --> 18:22.100
But it's volatile
and they fight a lot?

18:22.102 --> 18:24.635
Yeah, they're in love.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.404
When they first met

18:26.406 --> 18:28.673
they were really wild.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.708
Then they knew they had
something special,

18:30.710 --> 18:33.878
so they stopped fighting
and drinking.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.415
They want to have kids,
all that.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.151
Jackie's got a big heart.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.220
She's not a bad girl.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.658
CARSON:
All right, we can
figure this out.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.127
All right,
we've got money offshore.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.162
We just need some cash
to disappear.

18:51.164 --> 18:54.665
(panting)

18:54.667 --> 18:56.167
Phone, give me your phone!
It's in my bag

18:56.169 --> 18:58.803
at the club.
Thomas, phone,
give me your phone.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.240
(dialing)

19:02.242 --> 19:03.841
Where are you?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.910
Good.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.749
Baby, what
are you doing?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.684
What do you think?
We can't drive off in that.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.686
Thomas, you still remember
how to hotwire a car?

19:15.688 --> 19:16.654
You guys just
dump me here, man.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.122
Why?
Why?

19:18.123 --> 19:19.589
You, you want me to go
on the lam with you?

19:19.592 --> 19:20.658
No, I'll take my chances.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.926
You're coming!

19:27.767 --> 19:29.467
Whatever Jackie's motives were,

19:29.468 --> 19:31.168
whether she's working
with us or against us,

19:31.171 --> 19:33.171
we have to assume

19:33.172 --> 19:35.172
that Carson made her as the CI
and her life is at risk.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.541
There's no card-skimming
equipment in that building,

19:36.543 --> 19:37.675
there's no computer trail?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.377
It's off-site,
we don't know where.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.778
Carson's mobile

19:40.780 --> 19:41.913
or very well cloaked.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.481
How wide are your warrants?
Any and all

19:43.483 --> 19:46.617
electronic surveillance,
if that's what you mean.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.686
What do you need here, Spike?
Detective Danner, it's
your investigation,

19:48.688 --> 19:51.756
but give me a chance
at the lawyer's laptop.
I'll have to take it apart.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.325
He's good, right?

19:54.327 --> 19:56.427
PARKER:
He's the best.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.799
So, what, is this
a love-on-the-run type thing,

20:01.801 --> 20:04.468
Bonnie and Clyde?
Still a lot of unknowns.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.370
So what do you think?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.772
I think that it's complicated.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.674
This girl--
she's stuck in the middle,

20:09.676 --> 20:11.509
she's emotionally
reacting while the
whole thing snowballs.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.945
I don't even think that she
knows what outcome she wants.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.379
She's flipping.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.548
So she still may end up
on our side.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.683
She could.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.959
THOMAS:
Okay, don't worry, man.

20:27.961 --> 20:31.762
We'll find out
who did this to us.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.719
DANNER:
Well, I'll be damned.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.754
SPIKE:
See, I got a transaction
with hits on two IP points.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.523
If I could access your database
and trace one more...

20:59.525 --> 21:01.692
You can triangulate.
Maybe.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.934
Sorry.
Yeah.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.643
You're right, he's good.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.977
Spike.
Boss, it was you
that saved the bacon.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.946
You must have shut the screen
on that computer

21:21.948 --> 21:25.950
right when the scrub started.
He recovered 70%
of the hard drive.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.802
Then I decrypted an old
transaction between Carson

21:27.803 --> 21:29.653
and Griffin, followed this wild
IP spoofing trail, like Prague;

21:29.656 --> 21:31.856
Cambridge, England;
Rio...
Fast-forward.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.424
Then pinpointed him
to an address in the East End.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.992
Let's go.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.664
(sirens wailing)

21:43.536 --> 21:45.536
A greasy spoon's his front?

21:45.538 --> 21:47.805
Yeah, check out
the roof.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.007
That's a lot of gear
for a $3.99 breakfast.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.876
Okay, Eddie,

21:51.878 --> 21:52.943
it smells good.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.545
You're looking for an office,

21:54.547 --> 21:55.613
a dedicated room.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.981
Copy.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.886
Police.
WOMAN:
What do you want?

22:01.888 --> 22:03.554
We're looking
for Alex Carson.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.989
ED:
Wordy, you hang here.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.091
Got it.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.440
(beeping)

22:29.082 --> 22:31.082
Police!
Right there, right there!
Don't move!

22:31.084 --> 22:33.651
Okay, okay, don't shoot.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.053
ED:
Greg, we got an
accomplice here,

22:36.055 --> 22:37.054
but Carson
and Jackie

22:37.056 --> 22:38.856
are still at large.

22:52.105 --> 22:54.805
What are you doing, baby?

22:54.807 --> 22:57.575
We're waiting,

22:57.577 --> 23:00.044
all right, for the cash,

23:00.045 --> 23:02.512
and I still have half a million
dollars worth of data to flog.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.682
Cops burst in and Griffin
never transferred

23:04.684 --> 23:06.517
the money to
my account.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.886
All right, he could be
the one who sold us out.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.154
(scoffs)

23:10.156 --> 23:12.456
Oh, what's that
supposed to mean?

23:12.458 --> 23:15.559
Nothing.
Nothing.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.864
Out.

23:23.703 --> 23:26.070
Both of you.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.108
I don't know any Carson.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.676
ED:
You were packing up

23:32.678 --> 23:34.011
his cash and his computer.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.013
Come on.
Which means you were
either stealing them

23:36.015 --> 23:37.014
or you're delivering them.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.182
So which is it?

23:38.184 --> 23:39.650
I don't know any Carson.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.168
SAM:
He's got you doing

23:41.169 --> 23:42.685
all his heavy lifting,
all his dirty work.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.155
JULES:
And, you know,
cases like these,

23:44.157 --> 23:45.756
when you get
your fingerprints everywhere,

23:45.758 --> 23:47.191
guess who gets sold
out in the end.
Guess who takes

23:47.193 --> 23:48.926
the fall for the brains
of the operation.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.164
So you either tell us
where you're meeting Carson

23:53.166 --> 23:55.833
or you will take the fall,
I guarantee it.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.908
They're down at Leslie Spit.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.744
So who ratted, who?

24:06.746 --> 24:08.145
Yeah, I don't know.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.181
Yeah, you suspect?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.018
What are you
looking at her for?
Come on,
man, it was her.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.986
What?

24:15.988 --> 24:17.621
Baby, I would never
do that to you.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.156
I would never...
Ah...

24:19.158 --> 24:22.193
That just makes me
think it was you.
Baby, baby...

24:22.195 --> 24:23.644
Don't point that at me, man.

24:23.645 --> 24:25.094
Then tell me
what I need to know.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.497
All right.

24:26.499 --> 24:27.748
I caught her locking the door up

24:27.749 --> 24:28.998
at the meet
just before the cops came in.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.801
Yeah, you told me to.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.970
You told me to, you said
no one in or out, baby.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.005
I was just doing what you
told me-- no one in or out.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.842
I got out; the door
wasn't locked.
Yeah, I made her unlock it.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.810
I didn't do anything.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.011
You're gonna
believe that?

24:42.081 --> 24:43.614
What do you think, man,

24:43.615 --> 24:45.148
I'm gonna trust you
over my own woman?

24:45.151 --> 24:46.684
I don't think you see
straight anymore.
Oh, you don't?

24:46.686 --> 24:48.219
Yeah, I think you've been
blind since she showed up.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.054
Shut up!
Keep on talking!

24:50.056 --> 24:51.489
She's using you, man.
Shut up!

24:51.491 --> 24:52.490
You take her in,

24:52.492 --> 24:54.058
you get her close,
you trust her

24:54.060 --> 24:55.192
with our business, bro?!

24:55.194 --> 24:57.094
Shut up!
She doesn't care
about you, man!

24:57.096 --> 24:58.829
Shut up!
She doesn't
love you, bro!

24:58.831 --> 25:00.831
She's only looking out
for herself!
Thomas, shut...

25:00.833 --> 25:04.235
Yo! What, what, what?! Huh?!

25:05.238 --> 25:08.005
(gunshot, Thomas screams)

25:11.077 --> 25:13.844
(groans)

25:13.846 --> 25:14.845
(gasps)

25:14.847 --> 25:16.113
Oh, my God.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.152
JACKIE:
What did you do?

25:24.624 --> 25:27.958
(gasping)

25:27.960 --> 25:29.159
(stops breathing)

25:29.161 --> 25:33.230
(sobbing)

25:42.108 --> 25:44.608
Jackie, you saw him
come at me, right?

25:44.610 --> 25:45.776
(sobbing)

25:45.778 --> 25:49.146
Baby, you saw him
come at me, right?

25:49.148 --> 25:50.948
I didn't have a choice.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.450
(gasping)

25:52.451 --> 25:53.951
I didn't want to;
he made me do it.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.753
He made me do it!

25:55.755 --> 25:56.754
(sobbing)

25:56.756 --> 25:58.889
I didn't have a choice!

26:00.860 --> 26:02.860
Jackie, come here, baby.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.296
No.

26:05.298 --> 26:08.666
Get in the car, get in the car!

26:08.668 --> 26:10.234
Oh, no!

26:39.298 --> 26:43.033
(both breathing heavily)

26:45.738 --> 26:48.205
Are you all right, Jack?

26:48.207 --> 26:50.741
I need you to pull
yourself together, okay?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.810
Okay?

27:06.993 --> 27:09.693
(engine starts)

27:09.695 --> 27:10.995
(tires screeching)

27:25.378 --> 27:28.145
Is that our guy?

27:28.147 --> 27:29.680
Yeah, it is.
Can we be

27:29.682 --> 27:31.115
more specific?
It's the guy

27:31.117 --> 27:32.216
who interrupted
Jackie at the door

27:32.218 --> 27:34.051
in the club.
PARKER:
Got I.D.?

27:34.053 --> 27:35.919
(siren wailing)

27:35.921 --> 27:37.321
Thomas Arvedson.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.956
So who's Thomas Arvedson
in all this?

27:38.958 --> 27:41.258
(siren wailing)

27:42.228 --> 27:45.195
Huh... let's ask Danner.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.800
He's an associate
of Carson's.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.368
How is he an associate?

27:51.370 --> 27:52.970
We're not
really sure.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.989
You're not sure?

27:54.990 --> 27:57.007
Like you weren't sure
about the reliability of your CI

27:57.009 --> 27:59.076
or you weren't sure
where Carson's base was?

27:59.078 --> 28:00.944
You jumped the bust here,
Officer.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.080
You were hungry to get
Griffin, I get that,

28:03.082 --> 28:04.181
but you put my people
in the line

28:04.182 --> 28:05.281
of fire before you had
the whole picture.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.351
You're gonna lose
both cases--

28:07.353 --> 28:08.786
Griffin and Carson.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.087
We can still get Carson.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.922
PARKER:
He's Homicide's case now.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.924
Maybe they can make it stick.

28:15.294 --> 28:18.195
The phone was used to call
the guy we grabbed at the diner.

28:18.197 --> 28:22.199
So, what, they come down
here to meet the money,

28:22.201 --> 28:25.235
Carson thinks Thomas is
the snitch and offs him, what?

28:25.237 --> 28:26.904
But why doesn't Thomas
finger Jackie first?

28:26.906 --> 28:28.138
He saw her lock the door.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.139
We should be standing
over her body.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.374
SAM:
What if Jackie
told Thomas

28:30.376 --> 28:32.042
it was Carson,
pinned it all on him?

28:32.044 --> 28:33.844
I don't think that's our girl.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.446
What makes you say that?
It's just what I got

28:35.448 --> 28:36.864
from her friend Britt.

28:36.865 --> 28:38.281
I don't think she would
escalate it this way,

28:38.284 --> 28:40.017
not by choice.

28:40.018 --> 28:41.751
I mean, she may be reckless,
but I think she just

28:41.754 --> 28:43.120
wants this whole thing
over with.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.254
And if Thomas accused her?

28:44.256 --> 28:45.823
She would deny it,

28:45.824 --> 28:47.391
but I think Carson is
so in love with her,

28:47.393 --> 28:49.460
he couldn't even imagine
her betraying him.

28:49.462 --> 28:50.894
The guilt would be
hitting right about now.

28:50.896 --> 28:54.048
She'd see this
as her fault.

28:54.049 --> 28:57.201
Yeah, so if she's coming back
to our side, it would be now.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.505
CARSON:
I mean, I had to do it.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.341
He sold us out.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.343
You saw the way
that he came at you.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.313
I mean, you know someone, you
work with them, you help them,

29:09.315 --> 29:11.482
and they stab
you in the back.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.784
I mean, I just can't
let that go, can I?

29:13.786 --> 29:16.954
Baby, we need
to give ourselves up.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.522
What?

29:18.524 --> 29:19.523
We've got no cash.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.091
Where are we going to go?

29:21.093 --> 29:23.060
Listen, we lay low,
I'm gonna think of something.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.962
We got cash offshore, we
just need to get to it.

29:24.964 --> 29:25.963
This isn't going
to go away.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.498
They'll find Thomas.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.199
Don't you ever say
his name again.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.101
Fine, they've got Griffin;
he'll tell them everything.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.503
Don't worry about
Griffin, all right?

29:32.505 --> 29:35.272
He's going to be
out in 24 hours.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.374
Oh, baby.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.375
(laughs)

29:38.377 --> 29:40.410
I chartered
Griffin

29:40.412 --> 29:41.411
a plane.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.013
It is waiting for him.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.782
We just need to get to it.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.184
You see, you and I--
we just keep fighting.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.286
We just keep fighting, and
everything's gonna be all right.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.960
Alex...

29:56.962 --> 29:59.930
it was me.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.233
What was you?

30:03.235 --> 30:04.234
The police.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.903
I gave the information.

30:05.904 --> 30:07.571
It wasn't Thomas, it was me,
and I can't carry this

30:07.573 --> 30:08.972
anymore, baby.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.307
I love you, but it was me.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.109
It was me,
it was me!
Don't...

30:12.111 --> 30:13.143
Don't do this to me, Jack!

30:13.145 --> 30:15.179
It was...
It was me!

30:17.183 --> 30:20.918
(screaming)

30:20.920 --> 30:22.252
(sobbing)

30:35.267 --> 30:38.335
(coughing)

30:45.344 --> 30:48.145
(sobbing)

30:50.115 --> 30:53.617
(dialing phone)

30:56.222 --> 30:58.121
(phone ringing)

30:58.123 --> 30:59.890
Unis found Carson's car.

30:59.892 --> 31:02.392
Same lot had a stolen car report
this morning.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.394
He'll dump that one
pretty quickly, too.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.430
(snaps fingers)

31:06.432 --> 31:08.332
JACKIE (over phone):
It doesn't matter.

31:08.334 --> 31:11.034
I ruined everything.

31:11.036 --> 31:15.205
(sobbing)

31:15.207 --> 31:17.207
I deserve to die.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.977
Does he know about you, Jackie?

31:19.979 --> 31:21.695
Friend.

31:21.696 --> 31:23.412
Jackie, I have a friend
who wants to talk to you, okay?

31:23.415 --> 31:25.249
(sobbing)

31:25.251 --> 31:26.416
PARKER:
Jackie, this is Sergeant Parker.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.252
You can call me Greg.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.153
I was at the club last night.

31:30.155 --> 31:32.389
I know things didn't work out
the way you wanted.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.891
I just want this over.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.092
So do we, Jackie.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.393
But it keeps going on

31:36.395 --> 31:38.462
and on and keeps getting worse.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.897
From now on,
we can make it better.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.131
We can do that.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.267
No, we can't.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.268
You don't get it.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.269
Yes, I do.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.303
No, you don't get it.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.971
Yes, I do.

31:47.973 --> 31:50.574
I'm at the Leslie Spit
right now.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.176
You're with Thomas?

31:53.178 --> 31:54.678
Yes.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.147
You don't have to run from this.

31:57.149 --> 32:00.317
(sobbing)

32:00.319 --> 32:01.985
JACKIE:
It was an accident.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.420
I swear, it was an accident.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.389
I believe you.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.357
We see signs of struggle,
and if you want this to be over,

32:07.359 --> 32:11.094
finally free of this, you need
to tell us where you are.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.138
Jackie?

32:24.476 --> 32:26.043
Jackie, you there?

32:27.012 --> 32:29.613
We're going to the plane,

32:29.615 --> 32:32.015
the private plane
that Griffin came on.

32:32.017 --> 32:34.284
Thank you, Jackie.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.386
If I don't make it,
it doesn't matter.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.938
Oh, yes, it does.

32:37.939 --> 32:39.489
Yes, it does.
Are you in danger right now?

32:39.491 --> 32:43.093
Jackie, Jackie?

32:43.095 --> 32:45.162
Are...?

32:48.067 --> 32:49.199
Airport.

32:49.201 --> 32:52.069
I'm right behind you.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.137
(sirens wailing)

32:59.111 --> 33:00.444
Jackie, where are you going?

33:01.413 --> 33:03.480
Jackie!

33:03.482 --> 33:05.215
I am done!

33:05.217 --> 33:06.483
Get back here!

33:06.485 --> 33:07.417
No, I'm done!

33:07.419 --> 33:09.119
We are not done!

33:09.121 --> 33:12.389
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

33:12.391 --> 33:14.324
I killed my friend,
and you were there,

33:14.326 --> 33:17.294
so that makes
you part of it.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.363
So, we are not done!

33:34.513 --> 33:37.547
(tires squealing)

33:50.462 --> 33:51.661
(gasps)

33:53.332 --> 33:55.232
What am I supposed
to do with you?

33:55.234 --> 33:56.633
Alex...

33:56.635 --> 34:00.537
We were supposed to spend
our whole lives together.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.672
(crying):
I know.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.110
Was it real?

34:07.112 --> 34:08.478
What?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.414
Was any of it real?

34:10.416 --> 34:11.748
Yes.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.650
Alex, I love you.

34:16.588 --> 34:17.721
Then why?

34:17.723 --> 34:18.822
I'm sorry,

34:18.824 --> 34:21.291
they made me.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.493
I didn't have a choice.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.732
(hammer clicks)

34:28.734 --> 34:30.133
(whimpers)

34:31.437 --> 34:33.770
(sobbing):
No, no, Alex...

34:33.772 --> 34:36.139
(sirens wailing)

34:36.141 --> 34:38.275
The plane is a Falcon 50
three-engine commuter jet.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.078
Should be in the hangars,
southeast corner of the airport.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.212
PARKER:
Okay, listen up, everybody.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.281
I know this is a long shift,

34:44.282 --> 34:46.349
so this is just to remind
everybody, including myself,

34:46.351 --> 34:49.219
no matter how this went down
tonight, it doesn't matter,

34:49.221 --> 34:51.688
however Jackie played this,
it doesn't matter.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.590
She's still a C.I.
under imminent threat.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.226
Spike and Jules,
you head to the hangar.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.395
Sam and Ed, I want you
on the periphery.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.566
Copy that.
We're minutes away.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.367
(sirens continue wailing)

35:06.872 --> 35:08.271
(tires screech)

35:09.775 --> 35:11.441
(jet engines humming)

35:13.779 --> 35:16.580
PARKER:
Jules, check the vehicles!

35:16.582 --> 35:18.115
Spike, cut the engine!

35:18.117 --> 35:20.617
Wordy, hangar roof!

35:20.619 --> 35:22.252
You're Sierra!
I'm Sierra?

35:22.254 --> 35:23.353
Go!

35:23.355 --> 35:26.289
JULES:
Car's empty.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.366
Open the door!

35:36.368 --> 35:37.534
(engines power down)

35:37.536 --> 35:39.469
PARKER:
Alex Carson, this is

35:39.471 --> 35:42.739
Sergeant Greg Parker with the
Police Strategic Response Unit!

35:42.741 --> 35:44.407
You need to exit the plane!

35:44.409 --> 35:46.910
Show me your hands!
Do it now!

35:46.912 --> 35:48.445
No visual on the subject.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.481
No visual.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.585
He's coming out.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.256
Show me your hands.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.559
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

36:05.330 --> 36:07.564
Alex Carson!
You need to exit the plane!

36:07.566 --> 36:08.832
SPIKE:
Get behind the truck.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.834
You need to do it now!

36:34.826 --> 36:37.227
Show me your hands, Jackie.

36:38.730 --> 36:41.231
Where is he?

36:41.233 --> 36:42.933
You're Greg.

36:42.935 --> 36:46.536
I recognized
your voice.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.872
I've got Jackie--
Carson's not
on the plane.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.510
Where is he, Jackie?

36:53.512 --> 36:55.512
He's not here.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.984
Why'd you do this?

37:00.986 --> 37:02.452
Why do you

37:02.454 --> 37:03.987
keep helping him like this?

37:03.989 --> 37:06.423
Everything I have,
everything I am

37:06.425 --> 37:08.358
is because of him.

37:10.429 --> 37:13.430
I should never
have sold him out.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.366
Thomas is dead because of me.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.570
And when I told him...

37:20.572 --> 37:24.708
Alex looks at me, and...

37:24.710 --> 37:27.277
he just forgives me.

37:33.552 --> 37:37.454
PARKER (over radio): Hey,
Team One, Carson's on the run.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.824
Repeat, Carson is not
yet in custody.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.426
Sierra, I have
the subject on foot.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.694
Northbound, east side.

37:44.696 --> 37:47.364
(panting)

37:47.366 --> 37:49.266
(tires squeal)
I got him.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.701
WORDY:
He's coming back
towards the plane.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.970
(tires squeal)

38:07.653 --> 38:12.055
ED:
Alex, I need you
to put the gun down.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.623
Let's see some hands.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.592
Put the gun down,
hands on the fence.

38:15.594 --> 38:16.660
Hands on the fence!

38:16.662 --> 38:18.061
Put the gun down, Alex!

38:18.063 --> 38:19.429
I have the solution.

38:19.431 --> 38:20.930
I got the solution, too, boss.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.966
Sierra, hold. Spike, hold.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.668
Put your hands
up on the fence.

38:24.670 --> 38:25.935
Do it now!

38:26.938 --> 38:29.306
Come on, now,
drop the gun.

38:29.308 --> 38:32.676
Guess it's not the broken heart
that kills you, huh?

38:32.678 --> 38:35.011
Alex, you're a smart guy here,
so take the long view--

38:35.013 --> 38:36.513
it is still life.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.615
Not without her.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.784
(siren approaches)

38:42.521 --> 38:43.887
Just put the gun down.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.424
I said put the gun down.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.695
I have to see her again.

38:51.697 --> 38:52.762
Then drop the gun.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.397
I have to say good-bye.

38:54.399 --> 38:55.598
Put the gun down, Alex!

38:58.637 --> 38:59.569
Alex...

38:59.571 --> 39:01.104
Alex, you put

39:01.106 --> 39:03.773
the gun down,
and I give you my word you will.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.812
She does not want
to see you die, Alex.

39:13.418 --> 39:14.551
Sam.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.752
Okay.

39:17.389 --> 39:18.621
Jules.

39:18.623 --> 39:20.724
Jackie!

39:38.744 --> 39:40.810
¶ ¶

39:43.515 --> 39:44.814
I'm so sorry.

39:44.816 --> 39:45.882
Babe, I know.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.650
I'm so sorry.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.956
¶ ¶

39:58.897 --> 40:02.065
¶ When it's time to go ¶

40:02.067 --> 40:03.566
¶ Say so ¶

40:03.568 --> 40:05.735
¶ And I'll know ¶

40:05.737 --> 40:09.506
¶ When it's time to go ¶

40:13.678 --> 40:16.413
¶ When it's time to leave ¶

40:16.415 --> 40:19.783
¶ Don't grieve for me ¶

40:20.819 --> 40:23.887
¶ When it's time to leave ¶

40:25.824 --> 40:29.926
¶ Just wave... ¶

40:29.928 --> 40:32.629
¶ Good-bye ¶

40:32.631 --> 40:37.167
¶ Just wave... ¶

40:37.169 --> 40:39.869
¶ Good-bye. ¶

40:42.707 --> 40:47.010
Eddie, I got to ask you about
what happened at the club.

40:48.513 --> 40:50.980
You hesitate at the door
because you had a bad feeling,

40:50.982 --> 40:54.184
or this thing at home
leaking into work?
That's why you put me

40:54.186 --> 40:56.586
on the perimeter?
I'm glad I did.

40:56.588 --> 40:58.572
Okay, Greg, look...

40:58.573 --> 41:00.557
we did the best we could
with the information we had.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.126
If I had had a bad feeling,
I would've said something.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.762
Would you?

41:05.764 --> 41:08.832
¶ Don't hold on to my hand ¶

41:10.702 --> 41:13.136
I saw Sophie last night,

41:13.138 --> 41:16.606
and she said that
I have to choose.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.508
What do you mean?

41:18.510 --> 41:21.744
It's her, the kids.
Or it's the job.

41:21.746 --> 41:23.646
It's the job.

41:23.648 --> 41:26.816
And what am I
supposed to do with that?

41:26.818 --> 41:29.052
What am I supposed to do?

41:29.054 --> 41:32.121
¶ Good-bye, just wave... ¶
