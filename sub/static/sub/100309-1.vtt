WEBVTT

00:02.580 --> 00:04.460
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:04.460 --> 00:07.000
Daly: Terribly sorry, folks.
That was not on the radar.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.670
You've all been missing,
presumed dead, for 5 1/2 years.

00:10.670 --> 00:11.760
Ben!

00:14.180 --> 00:15.640
Olive.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.430
Saanvi: I discovered
something in Cal's blood.

00:18.430 --> 00:19.810
It wasn't there
before the plane,

00:19.810 --> 00:21.310
and it wasn't produced
by the cancer.

00:21.310 --> 00:22.680
It's all connected.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.060
But aren't you
seeing things,

00:24.060 --> 00:25.980
hearing things
in your head?

00:25.980 --> 00:28.690
Michaela:
Set them free.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.980
The ability to see and hear
what's going to happen?

00:30.980 --> 00:32.820
That's an incredibly
powerful weapon --

00:32.820 --> 00:34.530
for the military,
for intelligence.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.160
NSA, drop your weapon!

00:39.740 --> 00:41.410
Robert Vance died
as he lived --

00:41.410 --> 00:43.000
in service
of our great country...

00:43.000 --> 00:46.210
The Major: Ben Stone is only
a vehicle to get to his son.

00:46.210 --> 00:48.880
Until we're sure the boy
is our Holy Grail,

00:48.880 --> 00:50.380
we sit tight.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.050
Beloved,
my fellow passengers and I

00:52.050 --> 00:53.670
were sent back
to heal the world.

00:53.670 --> 00:54.880
What is this?
Some kind of scam?

00:54.880 --> 00:56.380
Ben, this is my --
my calling.

00:56.380 --> 00:58.010
Man: Freaks!

00:58.010 --> 01:00.640
Ben: If you come anywhere near
a member of my family again,

01:00.640 --> 01:02.100
then you will know exactly
what someone

01:02.100 --> 01:04.600
who has already died once
is willing to do.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.310
I can't leave.
He's almost here.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.350
It's him! It's him!
Don't hurt him!

01:08.350 --> 01:11.440
Whatever happened to us
on that plane

01:11.440 --> 01:13.030
also happened to Zeke
in his cave.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.360
I'm pregnant.
Six weeks, maybe.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.780
So, right when the plane
came...

01:16.780 --> 01:17.910
Or just before.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.030
I'm Danny.

01:19.030 --> 01:20.740
Grace's --
I know.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.870
I have an appointment...
with a therapist.

01:22.870 --> 01:24.410
Please, come in.

01:25.790 --> 01:28.960
Ben: The exact amount of time
he was gone is the same...

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
exact amount of time
he was alive again.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.630
Are you saying you
have some kind of...

01:32.630 --> 01:33.800
expiration date?

01:34.460 --> 01:37.010
Olive: June 2, 2024.

01:37.010 --> 01:38.380
It's always been you.

01:39.470 --> 01:41.300
I want you out of here
before she comes back.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.350
Michaela and I,
we're meant to be together.

01:45.730 --> 01:46.890
Back off!

01:46.890 --> 01:48.230
Put the gun down.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.490
Peanuts?
Ma'am, would you like peanuts?

02:02.490 --> 02:05.040
Woman:
Anything sodium-free.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.750
Mom's not wrong -- Jared's not
gonna wait around forever.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.380
Great marriage pep-talk.
Thank you.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.000
Why're you fighting this
when all it's gonna do

02:12.000 --> 02:13.250
is make you happy?

02:13.250 --> 02:14.840
It's all we want for you.

02:17.630 --> 02:19.430
That's really sweet of you.
You must be drunk.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.800
Definitely.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.010
Say yes to Jared.

02:25.010 --> 02:26.310
Have a wedding, a honeymoon.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.810
Turn the page. It's time.

02:27.810 --> 02:29.350
Ben, what's going on?
How are we back here?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.100
Why are
we back on Flight 828?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.150
No, no, no.
It's just a nightmare.

02:35.150 --> 02:36.650
It's just a nightmare.

02:36.650 --> 02:39.450
The turbulence stops,
the turbulence stops.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.290
It didn't happen this way,
it didn't happen this way!

02:46.290 --> 02:47.750
It didn't happen
this way!

02:49.370 --> 02:51.880
Cal.
Cal, what's going on?!

02:51.880 --> 02:53.420
Answer me, please!

02:53.420 --> 02:57.420
Michaela, Michaela.
Michaela.

02:57.420 --> 02:58.970
Are you okay?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.800
Jared:

03:00.800 --> 03:03.930
Do you understand?
Hold on. Hold on, Michaela.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.470
Shots fired.
Officer down.

03:05.470 --> 03:07.180
-We're getting you help.
-Officer down.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.680
Jared: I'm so sorry.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.440
Yeah, I have eyes
on the suspect right now.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.310
I'm so sorry this happened.

03:12.310 --> 03:13.940
No, believe me,
he will not get away.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.270
Hey, am I gonna hurt her

03:15.270 --> 03:16.650
if I push on this too hard?!

03:18.820 --> 03:20.150
Run.

03:20.150 --> 03:22.490
No, don't --
don't exert any energy.

03:22.490 --> 03:23.780
Run.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.500
Move. You're not putting
enough pressure on the wound.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.670
Get...

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
Hey. Hey, Mick.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.630
It's okay, alright?
A bus is coming, I promise.

03:39.630 --> 03:42.510
Alright, just stay with me.

03:42.510 --> 03:43.680
Please.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.930
It's okay. It's okay.

03:46.930 --> 03:48.470
Mick.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.850
Zeke!

03:51.850 --> 03:53.600
Zeke, you son of a bitch!

03:59.280 --> 04:02.360
Doctor: Vitals.
What's her vitals?

04:02.360 --> 04:04.360
BP 89/51 and dropping.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.410
Possible longitudinal

04:05.410 --> 04:06.780
transected artery.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.740
She's crashing.
We need the O.R.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.800
Jared?!

04:18.800 --> 04:20.590
She's in surgery.
What happened?

04:20.590 --> 04:22.130
I came
into Mick's place.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.970
Zeke had a gun.
What?

04:23.970 --> 04:25.470
I tried to take it from him.
There was...

04:27.260 --> 04:29.560
There was a scramble.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.180
I mean, if I knew
she was there, I would've...

04:33.640 --> 04:36.230
A shot went off
as I pulled the gun away.

04:36.230 --> 04:37.360
She went down.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.270
Oh.
Oh, my God.

04:39.270 --> 04:42.070
Ben, I was there to try
to keep her safe.

04:42.070 --> 04:45.030
She's got
to pull through, Ben.

04:45.030 --> 04:46.820
She's got to pull through.

05:07.220 --> 05:08.800
The surgery just finished.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.300
They're moving her
into a recovery room.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.560
And?

05:11.560 --> 05:13.770
They said it went well.

05:13.770 --> 05:16.560
The bullet punctured
her abdominal artery,

05:16.560 --> 05:18.440
and we almost lost her,
but it sounds like

05:18.440 --> 05:20.570
she could
make a full recovery.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.530
Thanks for finding out.
When can we see her?

05:23.530 --> 05:25.530
Let's see
if we can sneak you in, okay?

05:25.530 --> 05:26.990
Alright. Uh...

05:26.990 --> 05:28.240
-Go.
-Yeah, go.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.450
We'll see her
when she's stronger.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.660
Alright.
No, I'm sorry.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.370
I don't know
what's going on,

05:33.370 --> 05:35.250
but she said that she didn't
want to see you.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.890
It took much longer
before I saw you,

05:51.890 --> 05:54.640
they'd have
to admit me, too.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.390
I don't think
your insurance

05:56.390 --> 05:58.480
covers worrying
about your sister.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.160
Where's Zeke?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.080
NYPD's looking for him.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.290
Jared told me what happened.
They'll find him.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.040
I hope they don't.

06:20.290 --> 06:22.500
Ben, I was
on the plane again.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.090
What do you mean?

06:24.090 --> 06:26.090
828. I was on the plane
with Cal.

06:26.090 --> 06:29.630
It was nose-diving.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.430
I know
that it's not reality,

06:31.430 --> 06:34.850
but -- but in my vision,
it was...

06:34.850 --> 06:36.560
it was crashing.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.270
Maybe it was just
a near-death experience,

06:38.270 --> 06:41.520
but it just --
Ben, it felt real.

06:44.110 --> 06:47.530
Michaela, you need
to know something.

06:47.530 --> 06:50.860
I think it's a Calling
about us dying.

06:50.860 --> 06:53.740
Not necessarily
on a plane.

06:53.740 --> 06:58.290
Griffin died after the exact
amount of time he was gone,

06:58.290 --> 07:01.540
and then Cal had a Calling
about that date.

07:01.540 --> 07:05.380
Mick, June 2, 2024...

07:05.380 --> 07:09.550
is exactly 5 1/2 years
after the date we returned.

07:09.550 --> 07:12.010
The same thing that happened
to Griffin...

07:12.010 --> 07:13.890
it's gonna happen to us.

07:16.510 --> 07:18.270
No.
I'm sorry.

07:18.270 --> 07:20.690
No, no,
it's just it -- it was --

07:20.690 --> 07:22.230
It wasn't
a normal Calling.

07:22.230 --> 07:23.690
I know it's a lot to take in.
No, no, no.

07:23.690 --> 07:25.570
It's a lot to take in.
No, listen to me, Ben.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.440
It was different.

07:27.440 --> 07:31.280
Did anyone else have a Calling
about the plane nose-diving?

07:31.280 --> 07:32.780
Cal: I did.

07:32.780 --> 07:35.070
Hey, buddy.
Come in.

07:36.870 --> 07:40.370
I was on the plane
with Auntie Mick.

07:40.370 --> 07:44.210
Cal, you were gonna tell me
something on the plane.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.920
As it was nose-diving,
you were gonna say something.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.800
Cal, what were
you gonna tell me?

07:55.800 --> 07:57.600
Save the passengers.

08:47.190 --> 08:48.650
Randall: Get off my property.

08:48.650 --> 08:50.860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:50.860 --> 08:52.280
Randall?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.650
I'm not here to hurt you.
My name is Ben Stone.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.610
I was with you
on Flight 828.

08:56.610 --> 08:58.070
What do you want?

08:58.070 --> 09:00.910
Are you hearing things,
Randall?

09:00.910 --> 09:04.000
Seeing things?
Visions? Voices?

09:07.880 --> 09:09.710
Do you get them, too?

09:11.750 --> 09:14.170
Can we talk about it?

09:14.170 --> 09:16.010
Saanvi:
You could've been killed.

09:16.010 --> 09:20.470
Ben?

09:20.470 --> 09:21.810
Okay,
I'm worried about you.

09:23.180 --> 09:24.560
I have no choice.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.020
The Calling said
"save the passengers."

09:26.020 --> 09:27.560
To me, that means
tracking them down

09:27.560 --> 09:29.310
and finding out who knows
something we don't.

09:29.310 --> 09:31.070
About the Death Date?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.940
Maybe we're the only ones
who know.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.690
Out of almost 200 people?

09:34.690 --> 09:37.660
No, someone has to have
some kind of clue,

09:37.660 --> 09:40.030
some kind of puzzle piece that
can help us try to stop it.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.910
Would you eat?
I'm worried about you.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.870
You're not telling people
about the Death Date, are you?

09:43.870 --> 09:45.660
No, I can't do that.

09:45.660 --> 09:48.120
Not without a solution.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.250
Not without knowing more.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.500
Grace: Let's pause

09:51.500 --> 09:53.670
on the Death Date talk,

09:53.670 --> 09:54.760
focus on something

09:54.760 --> 09:56.130
more positive.

09:59.470 --> 10:00.600
Ben:

10:00.600 --> 10:03.260
You're at 14 weeks.

10:03.260 --> 10:04.720
Second trimester.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.310
Moving along great.

10:06.310 --> 10:07.520
Grace:
We should tell the kids now.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.060
They're gonna lose
their minds.

10:10.060 --> 10:14.030
Bear with me.
New record system.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.860
How many
previous pregnancies?

10:17.860 --> 10:19.700
Um, two.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.910
Uh, two kids -- twins.

10:21.910 --> 10:24.490
One pregnancy.

10:24.490 --> 10:28.210
Uh, it's two pregnancies.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.290
I had a miscarriage
last year.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.050
Okay.

10:36.050 --> 10:38.050
I will see you
before you check out.

10:38.050 --> 10:39.590
Congratulations,
you two.

10:39.590 --> 10:41.340
Thank you.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.470
I should've told you.

10:46.470 --> 10:50.690
But you need to understand,
you and Cal were dead.

10:50.690 --> 10:54.070
I had a huge hole in my life.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.690
And Danny had
always wanted kids.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.990
Well,
if he always wanted kids,

11:01.990 --> 11:04.830
maybe we're wrong to not
find out if the baby's his.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.580
No.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.790
Ben...

11:08.790 --> 11:10.410
this is our time.

11:10.410 --> 11:12.750
If in six months,
when the baby's born,

11:12.750 --> 11:17.420
it turns out to be Danny's,
we'll deal with it then.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.800
For now
I just want it to be us.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.440
That's right.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.860
Hi.
Hi.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.360
-Hey.
-Yeah, she just won't quit.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.570
Will you ease up a bit?

11:37.570 --> 11:39.070
The first day
out of the hospital

11:39.070 --> 11:40.650
should be nothing but bingeing
junk food and Netflix.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.660
I tried
telling her that myself.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.990
I don't have
a day to waste.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.080
Well, if you don't wanna be
stuck in the basement,

11:48.080 --> 11:49.830
you could go up to my room.

11:49.830 --> 11:52.000
I've kind of wanted to move
downstairs anyway.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.460
That's really sweet,

11:53.460 --> 11:55.210
but it's just a few days.
It's fine.

11:55.210 --> 12:00.130
Although, honey, if you are
willing to move downstairs,

12:00.130 --> 12:03.090
that could help us out.
Mm.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.970
And why is that?

12:04.970 --> 12:07.010
Because your room would make
a perfect nursery.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.520
I knew it!
Mom's pregnant!

12:12.560 --> 12:13.770
You owe me 5 bucks.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.400
Hey, take it -- Take it easy.
Ow!

12:21.400 --> 12:23.900
Take it easy.
Oh, I'm so happy for you guys!

12:23.900 --> 12:26.240
Well, and for me.
I always wanted a bigger family.

12:28.030 --> 12:30.490
I can't say
that I feel any better,

12:30.490 --> 12:35.040
though Michaela finally out of
the hospital is a load off.

12:35.040 --> 12:39.550
We're not even related,
but I don't know.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.210
After everything
we've been through,

12:41.210 --> 12:43.010
she feels like family.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.140
Speaking of which,
the only downside is,

12:47.140 --> 12:49.850
I will miss seeing the Stones
around the hospital.

12:49.850 --> 12:52.980
You mean Ben.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.140
I'm sorry?

12:54.140 --> 12:55.900
I hear
how you talk about him.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.020
Am I wrong?

12:58.020 --> 13:00.570
I hadn't even thought
about it.

13:00.570 --> 13:03.280
Much.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.400
You don't have to beat
yourself up about it.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.990
You and Ben have been through
a traumatic journey together.

13:08.990 --> 13:12.370
You have seen Ben
at his most vulnerable.

13:12.370 --> 13:14.040
That's appealing.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.960
It's best for me not to think
about him in that way.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.170
That's impossible.

13:17.170 --> 13:18.460
Because of Grace.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.790
Yes, Ellen.
They're having a baby.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.460
Really?

13:21.460 --> 13:24.880
It's been a secret, but can
we not talk about this?

13:24.880 --> 13:26.510
Of course. Moving on.

13:26.510 --> 13:29.680
How's your stress level,
1 to 10?

13:29.680 --> 13:32.520
It's a 6.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.140
7 maybe.

13:34.140 --> 13:37.650
Professional stresses
adding to that?

13:37.650 --> 13:42.020
Two months together, and you've
barely talked about work.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.110
There's not much
to talk about.

13:43.110 --> 13:45.320
Work is good.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.650
Good.

13:49.450 --> 13:52.240
You, uh, redecorated.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.160
Ben: Two months
of tracking down passengers.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.500
It's not easy.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.000
A bunch have packed up
and moved away

13:57.000 --> 13:58.670
because of the Xers.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.250
Are they really
that threatening?

14:00.250 --> 14:02.090
Eh, feels that way.

14:02.090 --> 14:03.550
Blown up online.

14:03.550 --> 14:05.920
Now people
are wary of us.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.800
Tabloid articles
aren't helping.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.390
Here.
I swung by your place,

14:10.390 --> 14:12.970
grabbed some changes
of clothes, your mail.

14:12.970 --> 14:16.230
Thanks. Yeah, I don't think I'm
getting back there for a while.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.690
Stay as long as you want.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.060
I could use another set
of eyes on all this.

14:22.770 --> 14:26.190
Ben, I get that you're trying
to save the passengers,

14:26.190 --> 14:29.150
but we don't even know
from what.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.660
The Death Date, Michaela.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.830
The Calling told us
we're all supposed to die.

14:35.830 --> 14:39.870
We have until June 2, 2024,
to stop that from happening.

14:39.870 --> 14:42.000
And what
if we can't stop it?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.630
So, what,
we're not supposed to try?

14:43.630 --> 14:45.130
I'm not being dismissive,

14:45.130 --> 14:47.630
but if the Callings wanted me
dead, I would be dead.

14:47.630 --> 14:49.340
It saved my life.

14:49.340 --> 14:52.050
What if "save the passengers"
is about the here and the now?

14:52.050 --> 14:53.890
What if it's about helping them
one by one?

14:53.890 --> 14:56.600
I'm out there trying to help
every day,

14:56.600 --> 14:58.390
but if all we're doing
is rearranging chairs

14:58.390 --> 14:59.980
on the Titanic,
what's it matter?

15:07.360 --> 15:09.030
Ben, this --
this is from Zeke.

15:09.030 --> 15:10.610
It's his handwriting.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.040
He made it to Canada?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.120
He's never gonna know
about his Death Date.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.910
Mick, we've been over this.
You're assuming he's --

15:19.910 --> 15:21.670
You don't assume
the same thing?

15:21.670 --> 15:24.000
Ben, he's innocent.
We have to help him.

15:25.790 --> 15:27.210
Alright.
So what do we do?

15:27.210 --> 15:29.880
How do we find him?

15:29.880 --> 15:31.930
We have to make it possible
for him to come home.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.390
If I could just find a way
to clear his name

15:33.390 --> 15:34.680
and prove his innocence,

15:34.680 --> 15:36.430
then maybe he can show
his face again.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.740
Detective Stone.

15:55.740 --> 15:57.740
You don't start back up
until next week.

15:57.740 --> 15:58.990
Captain Bowers.

15:58.990 --> 16:01.040
Uh, sorry
that I wasn't here

16:01.040 --> 16:02.330
when you were formally
introduced.

16:02.330 --> 16:03.750
You weren't supposed to be.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.380
You were supposed to be
recuperating.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.500
So why aren't you recuperating?

16:08.500 --> 16:12.970
I'm here to ask you to call off
the hunt for Zeke Landon.

16:12.970 --> 16:15.010
You're quick to forgive,
Detective.

16:15.010 --> 16:16.260
It was an accident.

16:16.260 --> 16:17.600
That's not
how Detective Vasquez

16:17.600 --> 16:21.180
described it
in the IA report.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.230
He was mistaken.

16:23.230 --> 16:24.980
You told IA
you had no recollection

16:24.980 --> 16:26.520
of the moments
before you were shot.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.110
Maybe you were mistaken?

16:28.110 --> 16:30.150
I know Zeke,
and he would've never --

16:30.150 --> 16:32.110
All this,
this is why I was brought in.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.490
There's been
too many loose ends,

16:33.490 --> 16:35.280
too much muddy water
at this precinct.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.450
Bottom line, your new boyfriend
and your ex-boyfriend

16:37.450 --> 16:39.330
were fighting in your apartment,
you got shot,

16:39.330 --> 16:40.620
and your new boyfriend
ran off.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.290
Zeke is not my boyfriend.

16:42.290 --> 16:45.290
Whatever he is, you're
too close to this, Detective.

16:45.290 --> 16:46.580
Go home.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.640
Just gonna blow
right past me?

17:12.440 --> 17:15.320
I don't know what happened
that night exactly, Jared,

17:15.320 --> 17:17.870
but what I do know

17:17.870 --> 17:20.160
is that if you had stopped
obsessing over Zeke,

17:20.160 --> 17:21.870
if you'd actually listened
to me,

17:21.870 --> 17:25.870
then I wouldn't have ended up
with a bullet in my stomach.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.790
That I do know.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.380
You don't know.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.130
But you convinced yourself
so much of it

17:31.130 --> 17:33.170
that you block me from
visiting you in the hospital?

17:33.170 --> 17:35.340
Who does that?

17:35.340 --> 17:37.800
I wasn't ready.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.680
I might never be.

17:46.730 --> 17:49.310
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.950
Cal:
Save the passengers.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.100
And everything
started shaking

18:23.100 --> 18:24.390
when you saw the Vasiks
on the board?

18:24.390 --> 18:26.230
This is like
the plane Calling I had.

18:27.980 --> 18:30.100
Is that what the Calling meant,
to save these passengers?

18:30.100 --> 18:31.810
This Calling
started two months ago.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.150
I think it's about helping as
many of them as we can.

18:34.150 --> 18:35.440
Ben, this is
what I'm talking about,

18:35.440 --> 18:36.740
about getting out
into the world,

18:36.740 --> 18:37.990
as opposed to being stuck
in here,

18:37.990 --> 18:39.820
trying to crack
the Death Date.

18:39.820 --> 18:41.110
The work in here will help

18:41.110 --> 18:42.910
with the work we need
to do out there.

18:42.910 --> 18:45.660
Now, I tried contacting
the Vasiks.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.000
Here.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.710
I sent them a message
six weeks ago,

18:48.710 --> 18:50.500
then a follow-up e-mail
two weeks ago.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.920
Never heard back.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.920
Their case file said
that they had kids,

18:54.920 --> 18:57.050
yet the kids
weren't on 828.

18:59.380 --> 19:01.090
I spoke to Anson
on the plane.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.640
Mind if I get
some more ice?

19:07.640 --> 19:08.930
Help yourself.
Thanks.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.390
Oh.
Sorry. My bad.

19:10.390 --> 19:11.730
Ooh.
Yeah,

19:11.730 --> 19:13.060
tough to cool down
since we left.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.900
Mm. I've been there.
Summer of 2001,

19:14.900 --> 19:16.610
I fell asleep
on the Staten Island Ferry,

19:16.610 --> 19:18.530
and my entire left side
nearly melted.

19:18.530 --> 19:20.610
Yeah,
I'm usually bugging the kids

19:20.610 --> 19:21.950
to apply layer after layer.

19:21.950 --> 19:23.490
That's how I remember
to do the same.

19:23.490 --> 19:24.910
And this time
they remembered?

19:24.910 --> 19:26.580
Left them home, actually.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.620
The wife and I took a sort
of second honeymoon.

19:28.620 --> 19:30.330
Sounds amazing.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.040
Wasn't as great
as I thought it would be.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.630
Uh, missed the kids
every single minute.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.170
Never leaving 'em again.

19:37.170 --> 19:39.760
Mm.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.760
Someone was watching
their kids.

19:43.180 --> 19:45.300
Here.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.560
Says here that
they left them

19:46.560 --> 19:48.100
with a neighbor,
Sharice Fields.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.930
She raised these kids
for 5 1/2 years,

19:49.930 --> 19:51.020
then their parents
came back.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.440
I can't imagine that.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.110
We have to talk to Sharice.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.980
I'll get someone at the precinct
to pull up the address.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.280
Mick, you're supposed to rest.
Maybe Jared and I could --

19:59.280 --> 20:01.900
No, Jared is
the one who got me shot.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.160
I'm done involving him.
This is you and me.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.950
Alright.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.200
Thank you
for making that reservation.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.660
I have missed
our tea dates.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.290
Well, there's a chance
I'm not gonna be

20:13.290 --> 20:15.170
your only daughter very soon,
so I have to take advantage.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.290
Oh, I see.
That's...

20:18.960 --> 20:20.550
Danny. Hi.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.550
Hi.

20:21.550 --> 20:22.800
Hi.
Hi, hi!

20:22.800 --> 20:24.340
Hi.
Hey, Olive.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.180
So, uh, how's --
how's Michaela?

20:28.180 --> 20:31.480
She's better. Back on her feet,
getting stronger every day.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.770
Good.

20:32.770 --> 20:35.480
And work and school?
Everything?

20:35.480 --> 20:37.230
Good.
School's pretty boring.

20:37.230 --> 20:39.070
Yeah.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.730
Not so boring at home,
though.

20:41.610 --> 20:44.740
Oh. Oh.

20:44.740 --> 20:48.200
Uh, Michaela's just staying
with us,

20:48.200 --> 20:52.370
and, um, my father-in-law
has been looking after her,

20:52.370 --> 20:55.000
playing nurse, so...

20:56.630 --> 20:58.130
Well, we should be going.

20:58.130 --> 20:59.710
Yeah, um, me too.

20:59.710 --> 21:01.960
Um, it's good to see you.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.420
Yeah, you too.

21:08.430 --> 21:10.720
Why didn't you tell Danny
you're pregnant?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.100
Is Danny the father?

21:18.270 --> 21:19.560
I don't know.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.190
Oh, my God.

21:21.190 --> 21:25.700
Honey, if the baby
turns out to be Danny's,

21:25.700 --> 21:28.240
of course
we will tell him.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.700
You get that, don't you?

21:31.580 --> 21:34.910
I just thought this baby
would be something special...

21:34.910 --> 21:36.710
for our family.

21:36.710 --> 21:38.630
And it will be!
Something amazing

21:38.630 --> 21:43.670
to bring us all together when
everything else is so scary.

21:43.670 --> 21:48.090
And, of course, it's not
that simple for us.

21:48.090 --> 21:49.340
It never can be.

22:04.110 --> 22:05.610
Sharice?
Yes?

22:05.610 --> 22:08.030
I'm Detective Stone.
This is my brother Ben.

22:08.030 --> 22:09.740
We were both on Flight 828.

22:09.740 --> 22:10.780
Can we come in?

22:10.780 --> 22:13.120
Go play with your sisters.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.960
Every time they hear the bell,
they think it's their parents.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.420
Anson
said he would never
leave the kids behind.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.460
Thank you.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.590
Hey, guys.

22:25.590 --> 22:28.260
So, who's in charge here?
Me.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.720
What's your name, boss?

22:31.720 --> 22:32.760
Sasha.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.100
She's not in charge.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.430
Mama Sharice is.

22:35.430 --> 22:36.600
And who are you?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.560
Milo.
And this is Tula.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.900
She's allergic to peanuts.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.270
Oh. Good to know.

22:41.270 --> 22:42.690
Thank you.

22:42.690 --> 22:44.690
Sharice:
There was no other family,

22:44.690 --> 22:47.610
so I was "Mama"
all these years.

22:47.610 --> 22:50.360
And then their actual mama
and papa came back,

22:50.360 --> 22:52.700
and I became Mama Sharice.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.870
That must be hard
for all of you.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.330
It has been.

22:56.330 --> 22:58.500
Those children
are my angels.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.210
But Trina and Anson
coming home was a miracle,

23:01.210 --> 23:02.960
so of course
I stepped aside.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.090
For the kids' sake,
I kept coming around.

23:06.090 --> 23:07.670
They don't know their parents
from Adam.

23:07.670 --> 23:10.300
When was the last time
anyone saw Anson or Trina?

23:10.300 --> 23:12.300
They put the kids to bed
Saturday night.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.970
I showed up in the morning.

23:13.970 --> 23:16.470
Sunday brunch
has been our thing.

23:16.470 --> 23:18.140
Pontiac wasn't
in the driveway.

23:18.140 --> 23:19.890
They were gone.

23:19.890 --> 23:22.350
At least the kids were still
sound asleep, thank God.

23:22.350 --> 23:24.520
Have Trina and Anson
had any threats

23:24.520 --> 23:26.780
or hostile encounters
since they've been back?

23:26.780 --> 23:28.320
Haven't all of you?

23:28.320 --> 23:31.610
Harassing phone calls,
notes on the mailbox...

23:31.610 --> 23:34.990
Some son of a bitch
painted an X on the car.

23:34.990 --> 23:38.120
But that isn't
the worst of it.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.960
What was?

23:39.960 --> 23:45.090
They've been hearing things,
seeing things.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.130
Did they talk about
what they heard or saw

23:50.130 --> 23:51.420
or write it down?

23:51.420 --> 23:53.430
See for yourself.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.360
Bible verses.
Were they religious?

24:08.360 --> 24:09.940
Back in the day,
not so much.

24:09.940 --> 24:13.450
But since they returned,
it's like they were born again.

24:13.450 --> 24:15.200
Callings.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.740
They were scared to death.

24:18.740 --> 24:20.660
And so are these kids.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.540
Please help us.

24:37.970 --> 24:39.470
Hey.

24:39.470 --> 24:40.770
I saw a white van
just like that

24:40.770 --> 24:42.350
outside another
passenger's house.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.060
Did you get the plates?

24:44.060 --> 24:45.650
I mean, there's a lot
of white vans in the world.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.400
It could
just be a coincidence.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.730
Or it could have something to do
with the Vasiks' disappearance.

24:49.730 --> 24:51.570
Who would have taken them,
the Xers?

24:51.570 --> 24:53.150
Possibly.

24:53.150 --> 24:56.910
Or they could be
the Major's new lab rats.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.370
I'm here to see Zeke.

25:01.370 --> 25:04.830
I'm Cal,
Michaela's nephew.

25:04.830 --> 25:07.880
Young man, I haven't seen
my son in months,

25:07.880 --> 25:11.210
and I'm sure Michaela
knows that the NYPD

25:11.210 --> 25:14.220
has searched my house up and
down looking for him.

25:14.220 --> 25:17.590
They've had a car parked out
here nearly every night.

25:21.100 --> 25:25.560
He's here.
I know he is.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.310
Now, can I please come in?

25:32.940 --> 25:35.070
How'd you find me?

25:35.070 --> 25:36.400
Dumb question.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.490
Cal: You need a haircut.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.080
Good try.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.370
Had a buddy send it.

25:45.370 --> 25:48.420
Didn't want her
to worry about me.

25:48.420 --> 25:50.250
How is she?

25:50.250 --> 25:52.840
Still hurts.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.510
You're supposed to be
together.

25:54.510 --> 25:57.090
No, we're not.

25:57.090 --> 25:59.510
She almost died, Cal,
because of me.

25:59.510 --> 26:01.100
But the Callings --
The Callings said

26:01.100 --> 26:03.850
you guys are gonna die!

26:10.400 --> 26:12.270
You showed me
those tombstones, Cal.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.780
You were scared
to tell your family.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.400
The Callings did that.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.070
I know when now.

26:19.070 --> 26:20.950
I know when
it's gonna happen.

26:22.830 --> 26:26.750
Cal, I'm so sorry, buddy.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.040
Maybe it doesn't mean
anything.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.080
Maybe it means something else.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.330
You need to be with Michaela

26:31.330 --> 26:35.300
because she doesn't have
much time.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.220
And neither do you.

26:41.180 --> 26:44.180
Man: Alright. Appreciate it.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.020
Man #2: Okay.
We'll bring him.

26:51.940 --> 26:52.940
Woman: Precinct.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.020
What are you doing?

26:56.110 --> 26:58.450
I have to get into the server
to put in a traffic-cam request.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.610
You're not back on the job,

26:59.610 --> 27:01.070
which is why
Bowers sent you packing.

27:01.070 --> 27:03.240
You know me.
Dog with a bone.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.580
What bone?
You don't have a case file.

27:07.540 --> 27:09.500
Look, if this has something
to do with the Callings,

27:09.500 --> 27:11.580
I'm telling you right now,
this captain came to play.

27:11.580 --> 27:12.920
Alright?
She will shut you down.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.880
Noted. Thank you.
Michaela, I'm serious.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.550
This better be
precinct business.

27:16.550 --> 27:18.130
It is right there
on the board, okay?

27:18.130 --> 27:19.510
Anson and Trina Vasik.

27:19.510 --> 27:20.680
And that's your business
because?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.340
Because they were
on the plane.

27:22.340 --> 27:25.810
I think that
they were abducted, Jared.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.060
Okay,
here's another theory --

27:28.060 --> 27:30.190
They picked up and left.
Without their kids?

27:30.190 --> 27:32.810
Maybe they're
gonna send for them.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.610
Anson Vasik

27:34.610 --> 27:36.110
cleared his bank account
yesterday.

27:36.110 --> 27:37.900
$87,000.

27:37.900 --> 27:40.030
Does that sound like
a kidnapping to you?

27:40.030 --> 27:42.820
Could be. Maybe somebody
forced the withdrawal.

27:42.820 --> 27:45.450
Something is wrong here, Jared.
I can feel it.

27:45.450 --> 27:48.200
You know that means
chances are that I'm right.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.910
You need more people
on this.

27:49.910 --> 27:53.210
We're spread pretty thin,
thanks to your friend Zeke.

27:53.210 --> 27:55.630
You can drop that.
He is long gone.

27:57.880 --> 28:00.880
You know that because?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.180
I told him to run.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.230
I'm gonna pretend you didn't
just say that to me.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.280
Hey.
Hey.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.660
What do you got so far?

28:28.660 --> 28:30.500
Well...

28:30.500 --> 28:34.250
the Vasiks clearly had trouble
dealing with their Callings,

28:34.250 --> 28:35.630
and they were trying to make
sense of them

28:35.630 --> 28:37.040
through Bible verses.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.300
Romans 8:28? "All things
come together for good"?

28:39.300 --> 28:40.800
Revelation 20:14.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.170
"And death and Hell were cast
into the lake of fire.

28:43.170 --> 28:45.720
This is the second death."
Whoa.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.930
Yeah, I can't tell if they were
predicting the Death Date

28:47.930 --> 28:50.640
or predicting their death
would come sooner.

28:53.390 --> 28:55.730
Thanks for
coming so fast.

28:55.730 --> 28:56.940
Yeah, not a problem.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.270
You hear from them?

28:58.270 --> 28:59.730
This was in the mailbox.

29:11.830 --> 29:13.750
Hey.
I was right about the van.

29:13.750 --> 29:14.790
Someone's stalking
the passengers.

29:14.790 --> 29:16.290
Michaela: Yeah, maybe.

29:16.290 --> 29:17.460
But I don't think
it connects to the Vasiks.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.210
Why not?
They sent their life savings

29:19.210 --> 29:23.010
and what looks a lot like
a suicide note to Sharice.

29:23.010 --> 29:25.010
"Lake of fire
is the second death."

29:25.010 --> 29:27.260
What?
Hey, it's a verse
from Revelations.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.720
They had it on their wall.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.010
What, you think
they're gonna act it out?

29:30.010 --> 29:31.720
What the hell
is a lake of fire?

29:31.720 --> 29:33.180
There's a hundred
interpretations,

29:33.180 --> 29:34.850
but if you're driving around,
suicidal,

29:34.850 --> 29:37.850
it probably could be any body
of water in a fiery car crash.

29:37.850 --> 29:39.060
We got to find them.

29:39.060 --> 29:40.400
I'm, uh --
I'm coming to you, okay?

29:40.400 --> 29:41.570
Alright.

30:02.130 --> 30:03.880
Followed you
from the house.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.220
I didn't wanna
make a scene.

30:06.220 --> 30:07.630
I thought you were gone.

30:07.630 --> 30:10.050
That's what I wanted you
to think.

30:10.050 --> 30:11.550
Zeke, you can't be here
right now.

30:11.550 --> 30:12.930
This is way too dangerous.

30:12.930 --> 30:14.810
I needed to see you
once more.

30:14.810 --> 30:17.520
Once more for what?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.150
I kept telling myself
that tomorrow

30:19.150 --> 30:21.480
I was gonna be
a better person.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.400
Now I find out
there is no tomorrow.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.780
Cal got to me.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.490
Good. Then you know
that you should be

30:27.490 --> 30:29.490
as far away from here
as possible, living
your life, Zeke.

30:29.490 --> 30:31.240
You...

30:31.240 --> 30:33.080
Zeke,
you got to go right now.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.580
I called it in.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.080
What?

30:36.080 --> 30:37.660
This is what I need to do

30:37.660 --> 30:39.250
with what little time
I have left --

30:39.250 --> 30:40.460
own up to my actions.

30:40.460 --> 30:42.170
For once in my life.

30:42.170 --> 30:43.840
No more excuses.
No more running.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.210
None of this is on you.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.460
Of course it is.
I did this to you.

30:46.460 --> 30:48.550
It was an accident!
Exactly.

30:48.550 --> 30:50.300
I didn't mean to hurt you,
and I did.

30:50.300 --> 30:52.010
What happens
the next time I get a Calling?

30:52.010 --> 30:53.430
Zeke, please, please,
please go.

30:53.430 --> 30:55.350
Please.

30:55.350 --> 30:57.060
God, I wish...

30:57.060 --> 30:58.690
I wish I met you
some other way,

30:58.690 --> 31:00.850
you know,
in some other time.

31:00.850 --> 31:02.770
Who knows
what could've been?

31:06.730 --> 31:09.450
Officer: NYPD. Do not move.

31:09.450 --> 31:11.490
Put your hands on your head.
Wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no.

31:29.010 --> 31:30.680
Ben: Are you sure
it was the GW?

31:30.680 --> 31:32.140
Michaela:
How many times did Mom and Dad

31:32.140 --> 31:33.720
force picnics on us up here?

31:34.970 --> 31:36.390
There they are.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.900
Sorry to bother you.

31:48.900 --> 31:51.240
Uh, we're having
a private conversation.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.990
Anson.

31:52.990 --> 31:55.280
My name is Ben Stone
from 828.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.080
We spoke on the plane.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.700
What are you doing here?

31:59.700 --> 32:01.120
You're close enough!

32:03.080 --> 32:06.670
We came to tell you
you're not alone.

32:06.670 --> 32:10.050
We're all
in this together.

32:10.050 --> 32:12.130
We're not supposed to be back.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.340
We're supposed to die
a second death.

32:14.340 --> 32:15.850
It's right there
in the Scripture.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.060
I understand
why you believe that.

32:19.060 --> 32:22.190
It's more than believing!
We hear it!

32:22.190 --> 32:25.980
We see it in our heads
every day, every night!

32:25.980 --> 32:27.570
I've been hearing
insane things, too.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.530
So has my sister.

32:29.530 --> 32:33.450
We've been trying to make sense
of all this ourselves.

32:33.450 --> 32:36.620
How do we make it stop?

32:39.080 --> 32:42.500
Anson, turn off the engine,
and we can talk about this.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.880
Alright, alright!

32:49.090 --> 32:51.050
Get away from us!
I'm warning you!

32:51.050 --> 32:54.970
Anson, I remember how much
you love your family.

32:54.970 --> 32:58.140
I love mine just as much.

32:58.140 --> 33:01.970
You're not supposed
to leave them again.

33:01.970 --> 33:03.480
At least not yet.

33:05.940 --> 33:08.230
We don't want to.

33:08.230 --> 33:10.110
Oh, but the voices,
the visions,

33:10.110 --> 33:13.240
the headaches, the piercing
noise that won't go away,

33:13.240 --> 33:15.410
and now being shown that
we're supposed to die

33:15.410 --> 33:16.660
in the lake of fire.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.030
It's too much.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.660
We can't take it anymore.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.910
The voices, the visions...

33:21.910 --> 33:24.910
they're not telling you
to harm yourself.

33:24.910 --> 33:28.080
Then why do
we see this cliff?!

33:28.080 --> 33:30.000
The car going through
this railing?!

33:32.510 --> 33:35.260
Hearing the screams
of our children!

33:35.260 --> 33:38.220
If we have to die,
we will die alone.

33:38.220 --> 33:40.220
Not our babies!

33:49.810 --> 33:51.230
Ben!

33:57.820 --> 33:59.200
Man:
Thanks for saving us.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.950
I'm so glad you're all okay.

34:00.950 --> 34:02.910
Let me know if there's
anything else we can do.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.580
Good luck to you guys.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.590
The husband fell asleep
at the wheel.

34:11.590 --> 34:13.420
The car was hanging on
by a thread.

34:13.420 --> 34:16.090
It's a good thing
we were here.

34:16.090 --> 34:17.590
You saved their lives.

34:17.590 --> 34:20.180
How?
How is this possible?

34:20.180 --> 34:21.800
All we know is,
when the Callings come,

34:21.800 --> 34:23.260
we do the best we can
to follow them.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.310
But there's so many
we didn't follow.

34:25.310 --> 34:28.270
Well, my guess is, someone else
stepped in for you.

34:28.270 --> 34:29.810
There's a lot of us.

34:29.810 --> 34:32.190
How are the headaches, the --
the noises in your head?

34:35.400 --> 34:36.440
Gone.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.410
I have a feeling
it's gonna stay that way.

34:43.660 --> 34:44.910
Excuse me.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.460
Heard over the radio.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.000
You wanna tell me
how you, of all cops,

34:51.000 --> 34:54.090
happened to find
these people?

34:54.090 --> 34:55.550
Lucky break.

34:55.550 --> 34:57.010
Lucky my ass.

34:57.010 --> 34:59.090
I'll expect a full report.

35:01.010 --> 35:03.850
Like I said.
New sheriff in town.

35:03.850 --> 35:05.470
It wasn't just me, okay?

35:05.470 --> 35:08.350
Zeke saved those people.
Of course. Of course. Zeke.

35:08.350 --> 35:10.310
Zeke and I shared a Calling
that brought me here.
The misunderstood hero.

35:10.310 --> 35:11.980
If it hadn't been for that,
all six of those people

35:11.980 --> 35:15.360
would be dead.
Zeke turned himself in,
Michaela.

35:15.360 --> 35:16.690
He knows he's guilty.

35:16.690 --> 35:18.190
What am I missing here?

35:20.660 --> 35:23.990
Everything Zeke did,
he did for me.

35:27.290 --> 35:28.910
So did I.

35:40.220 --> 35:42.890
How many other passengers
are out there

35:42.890 --> 35:47.890
receiving Callings as confused
and afraid as the Vasiks?

35:47.890 --> 35:50.810
That's why you're out there,

35:50.810 --> 35:53.860
talking to as many of them
as you can.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.150
"Save the passengers,"
right?

35:56.150 --> 35:58.780
Let's hope
I can find them all in time.

36:01.700 --> 36:06.830
Seeing this couple
ready to end it all, it...

36:08.160 --> 36:11.540
...it made me think
about letting go

36:11.540 --> 36:16.000
of what doesn't matter
and embracing what does.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.920
So what does matter?

36:18.920 --> 36:21.970
That we're a family.

36:21.970 --> 36:24.180
All of us.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.640
Whatever a DNA test
might tell us.

36:30.430 --> 36:32.390
We should find out.

36:36.980 --> 36:39.480
But nothing changes, Ben.

36:39.480 --> 36:42.780
No matter what.

36:42.780 --> 36:44.990
Nothing changes.

36:54.040 --> 36:58.000
I'm thinking about moving out
of my parents' apartment.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.840
It's literally the only place
I have ever lived.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.840
I commuted to college.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.760
That week in Jamaica
was the only time in my life

37:04.760 --> 37:06.140
where I was by myself,

37:06.140 --> 37:07.680
and even that
wasn't by choice,

37:07.680 --> 37:10.510
but now
I think it's time.

37:10.510 --> 37:12.390
Fresh start makes sense.

37:12.390 --> 37:14.600
Thanks. I'm feeling
really good about --

37:14.600 --> 37:17.400
Saanvi,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

37:17.400 --> 37:19.650
but it's
my ethical obligation

37:19.650 --> 37:22.360
to tell you I think
I am wasting your time.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.360
What?

37:24.360 --> 37:25.990
Why would you say that?

37:25.990 --> 37:29.160
You are paying out of pocket
for psychiatric treatment,

37:29.160 --> 37:33.250
and yet I sense a reluctance
to be treated.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.000
Ellen, no, I'm a mess.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.130
I still have nightmares,
constant anxiety.

37:39.130 --> 37:40.880
Of course
I want the treatment.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.220
And yet our sessions still
remain very much on the surface.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.090
I have been doing this
a long time.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.850
It is clear to me that
there is more going on with you

37:49.850 --> 37:51.680
than you are sharing.

37:51.680 --> 37:57.060
If you're not truly ready to
heal yourself, save your money.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.230
You know where to find me.

37:59.230 --> 38:05.190
Meantime, here are some
non-clinical support groups.

38:13.620 --> 38:16.040
I wish you well.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.670
Truly.

38:35.890 --> 38:37.810
What if I'm ready?

38:42.820 --> 38:45.860
Something happened to us
on that plane.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.690
Hey!

39:24.690 --> 39:27.030
Who are you?!

39:27.030 --> 39:28.690
Huh?!

39:28.690 --> 39:30.910
What do you want?!

39:30.910 --> 39:33.410
Come on!
Open up!

39:33.410 --> 39:34.490
Hey!

39:34.490 --> 39:36.200
He--

40:08.650 --> 40:09.740
Hey, bud.

40:11.740 --> 40:14.120
Why doesn't he believe?

40:14.120 --> 40:15.200
Believe what?

40:15.200 --> 40:18.620
That he matters?

40:18.620 --> 40:20.830
I don't know.

40:20.830 --> 40:23.540
Maybe he just hasn't heard it
enough in his life.

40:23.540 --> 40:26.420
You need him.

40:26.420 --> 40:28.920
The two of you
have to do it together.

40:28.920 --> 40:31.260
Do what, Cal?

40:31.260 --> 40:33.340
I'm not sure what.

40:33.340 --> 40:36.510
I just know...

40:36.510 --> 40:38.930
I don't want
to do this anymore.

40:38.930 --> 40:41.060
I just want to be a kid.

40:41.060 --> 40:42.690
I know.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.070
Save the passengers.

40:54.070 --> 40:55.320
What?

41:03.120 --> 41:05.000
Zeke, Zeke!

41:08.130 --> 41:10.130
Who are you?!

41:10.130 --> 41:11.590
What do you want from me?!

41:22.220 --> 41:25.480
You're not the only one who
can come back from the dead.
