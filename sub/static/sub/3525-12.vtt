01:43.900 --> 01:45.800
Walter, hey, you looking for me?

01:47.100 --> 01:48.965
The Crazy Horse, that's you, right?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.200
- Yeah, you got something?
- Yeah, pole camera, three days ago.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.700
She locks up the club for the night.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.100
She's throwing away the garbage.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.400
Yeah?

02:11.200 --> 02:13.800
But then she changes her mind.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.100
Interesting.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.565
The good news is no polyps.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.300
The bad news is, as you can see,

02:32.400 --> 02:35.400
you've got a fairly severe case
of ulcerative colitis.

02:35.435 --> 02:37.800
- Jesus Christ.
- She was getting better.

02:37.835 --> 02:39.800
Then last week, another flare-up.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.850
How about the Prozac? Is it helping?

02:44.885 --> 02:47.165
She can't even sleep. Look at her.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.700
I'd like to start you on a regime
of Prednisone. It's a steroid.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.400
- Like for weightlifters?
- I've had great success

02:53.435 --> 02:55.400
treating this type of condition.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.600
I do need to warn you,
there are certain side effects.

02:58.635 --> 03:01.665
These are temporary,
but there's a chance of weight gain,

03:01.700 --> 03:05.700
accompanied by Cushing's Syndrome,
a swelling of the facial features.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.165
- Sort of a moon face.
- What?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.800
You've seen Jerry Lewis
in the last year or two?

03:10.900 --> 03:13.600
She's planning a wedding, for Christ's sake!

03:14.900 --> 03:18.165
It was fine one day,
then suddenly audio and no picture.

03:18.200 --> 03:22.200
- Somebody been fooling around with this?
- AJ had his friends over.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.300
How'd he do over there with your dad?

03:24.335 --> 03:26.200
- Raking the driveway?
- Fine.

03:26.300 --> 03:30.000
Except my mother kept asking him
if we were getting back together.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.300
You know, I dreamed
that I moved back in here.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.000
You know, just for the record...

03:44.000 --> 03:45.900
I realise what I did was wrong.

03:45.935 --> 03:47.700
My...

03:47.800 --> 03:50.065
activities while I lived here.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.600
Knowing you were wrong isn't the half of it.

03:52.635 --> 03:55.100
Oh, really? What's the other half?

03:55.200 --> 03:57.700
Well, suppose something
did happen where...

03:57.735 --> 04:00.165
theoretically, we did get back together.

04:00.200 --> 04:05.600
- Any marriage would need fidelity.
- Like Popeye says, "I am what I am. "

04:05.700 --> 04:07.750
Well, I didn't marry a cartoon.

04:07.785 --> 04:09.800
Well, it wouldn't be a cartoon.

04:11.300 --> 04:14.200
You had your own indiscretions yourself.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.200
- The thing with Furio?
- I did not sleep with him, Tony.

04:20.235 --> 04:23.000
I'm just saying that we're all human,
that's all.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.700
You know, the truth is, I got myself where I am.

04:31.735 --> 04:34.600
But your open indiscretion, total disregard...

04:35.300 --> 04:37.500
You're right, it was... it was horrible.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.000
A knot in your stomach when the phone rings.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.900
Like you were saying, you know.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.900
Theoretically though, if we do reconcile,

04:44.935 --> 04:47.200
that stuff will never happen again.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.800
- Come on, you gonna go or what?
- I was finishing my drink.

05:07.835 --> 05:09.000
Fuck!

05:27.000 --> 05:28.665
You can't stay holed up here.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.900
- That's not healthy, Carmine.
- How'd it get to this?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.800
Retaliation, counterattacks...

05:35.835 --> 05:38.000
We're at a fuckin' stagmire.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.500
We back down now, bunker down,

05:42.800 --> 05:45.165
what kind of a message does that send?

05:45.200 --> 05:50.000
Not just to Johnny's people, either.
Billy Leotardo. What the hell was that?

05:50.100 --> 05:53.100
This Blundetto asshole went off
the reservation.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.900
All due respect, Carmine,

05:59.000 --> 06:00.965
that's why you need to get out there,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.200
put your ear to the street,
let the guys see you take the reins.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.400
That's not how I wanna handle it.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.600
Hey, don't get me wrong,
I always liked your cousin,

06:23.700 --> 06:27.400
but whacking Phil's brother
was a major poke in the ass.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.900
You know my cousin almost cried
when I put him in charge of the casino?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.300
After all I did for that blue-eyed prick,
then he completely fucks me over.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.400
Now I practically gotta get
down on my knees to Johnny Sack.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.565
Where the fuck you been?

06:45.600 --> 06:50.200
Highway was jammed with broken heroes
on a last-chance power drive.

06:50.235 --> 06:53.600
Oh, you're gonna get fuckin' cute now.

06:54.400 --> 06:58.700
- Anything on Tony B?
- Nah, he's still on a milk carton.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.200
There she is.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.200
My Smelly Valentine.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.100
Christopher, that's not funny.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.200
What the fuck are you doing?

07:12.300 --> 07:14.500
I can handle a cocktail once in a while.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.265
You guys OK? You need anything else?

07:19.300 --> 07:22.300
- You're still feeling sick, hon?
- Please.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.500
They gotta replace her colon with a semi-colon.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.900
Maybe you should be a vegan.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.865
- Doctor says I gotta relax.
- From what?

07:30.900 --> 07:35.700
She's got the world at her feet,
she walks around like impending doom.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.400
Come on, we gotta go.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.700
Take it easy, now.

07:49.300 --> 07:52.900
Don't listen. People who've got
their health take it for granted.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.900
How's your thing with...?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.400
Just gotta keep an eye on it, that's all.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.900
So, Carm and me are getting back together,
maybe.

08:01.935 --> 08:04.865
That's great. The kids'll be thrilled.

08:04.900 --> 08:08.800
Yeah. When we get settled,
we'll have you guys over...

08:08.835 --> 08:10.800
Family dinner.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.500
Feel better, huh?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.900
John.

08:35.900 --> 08:42.299
First off, let me just say how sorry
I am for your loss. We all are.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.300
Take your fuckin' sorrys
and stick 'em in your ass.

08:45.335 --> 08:48.800
I could say nothing, be a heartless prick.

08:48.900 --> 08:52.000
He tried to talk, he couldn't
even say his last words.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.400
Anybody ever die in your arms,
you cocksucker?

08:56.435 --> 08:58.500
A family member, somebody you love?

08:58.535 --> 09:01.700
- No.
- Well, give it time.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.865
See if I can't make that happen for you.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.900
- That's enough.
- Philly, why don't you go have a drink?

09:06.935 --> 09:09.700
Don't tell me what to do, Jimmy.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.100
Jimmy's right.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.700
Fuck 'em, John. Fuck all of them!

09:24.200 --> 09:27.700
Was that fuckin' necessary?
He shouldn't even have been here.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.665
He's got a right to be here.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.600
He's got a right to a lot of things right now.

09:32.635 --> 09:35.500
My cousin acted alone. I did not sanction this.

09:35.535 --> 09:37.465
The lone-gunman theory.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.300
You know how close he and Angelo were
in the can. He flipped the fuck out!

09:41.400 --> 09:44.000
When he whacked Joey,
what flipped him out then?

09:44.100 --> 09:46.400
What do ya want, John?
What do ya want me to say?

09:46.500 --> 09:50.200
I want your cousin on a fucking spit!

09:51.700 --> 09:53.500
I don't know where he is.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.700
- Nobody does.
- Fine.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.200
Maybe one of your other relatives then.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.700
What, I gotta stand here
being threatened now?

10:04.800 --> 10:07.100
All right, nobody's making threats.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.165
Look, Tony's in hiding.

10:13.200 --> 10:17.400
You either deliver that prick to my door
or I will rain a shitstorm

10:17.435 --> 10:21.000
down on you and your family
like you have never fucking seen.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.400
We're done here.

10:46.900 --> 10:50.050
There are over 200,000 species of molluscs,

10:50.085 --> 10:53.200
and right there is a good example
of a conch,

10:53.300 --> 10:55.900
which is also known as a knobbed whelk.

10:55.935 --> 10:58.300
See, these raised spines...

11:00.100 --> 11:01.800
That's what I call my dick.

11:01.900 --> 11:04.100
I heard that.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.000
That's just nasty.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.800
Oh, fuck! Yo, check it!

11:09.835 --> 11:12.200
Oh, shit! Hurry up!

11:17.800 --> 11:20.265
Don't touch it!

11:20.300 --> 11:22.500
Apprentice Delaney, get back here!

11:31.600 --> 11:34.000
Little Meadow in a bridal gown.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.300
Couple more years, Grandma and Grandpa.

11:37.335 --> 11:39.500
Bite your tongue.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.300
So, the other day,
what you said, I processed it.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.100
You know, your feelings.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.300
It really hit home with me, finally.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.400
With you out of the house,
I've had a chance to do a lot of thinking.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.465
I mean, it's partly my fault

12:09.500 --> 12:12.400
but I need something else in my life.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.900
You know, with Meadow
getting engaged, AJ almost...

12:16.000 --> 12:18.100
You want another kid.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.600
No.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.200
It turns out there is a lot
for sale over on Crestview,

12:37.300 --> 12:39.165
a little over an acre.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.200
I was thinking I could build a spec house

12:42.800 --> 12:44.700
and take my dad in as a partner.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.200
I mean, my allowance is what it is, but...

12:51.400 --> 12:55.700
- How much is the lot?
- 600,000.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.600
Anyway, he would oversee the construction.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.700
Well, I'll call Ginsberg and...

13:10.000 --> 13:11.900
have him free up a down payment.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And then?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.600
I'll move back in.

13:21.800 --> 13:26.400
Supposing that happened, what about
the other issues that were on the table?

13:26.500 --> 13:28.400
Well...

13:29.300 --> 13:31.365
I swear to you, on our children,

13:31.400 --> 13:38.400
that my midlife crisis problems will
no longer intrude on you any more.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.465
Are you having dinner?

14:02.500 --> 14:07.300
- Have you settled on a caterer yet?
- Can I talk to you?

14:17.800 --> 14:21.500
- You hear from Tony?
- I talked to Kelvin... Calvin... whatever.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.400
That redneck from North Carolina.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.900
The Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco called.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.200
A bodega in Newark's selling
cigarettes without tax stamps.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.200
Stupid spics were supposed
to stamp 'em themselves.

14:32.235 --> 14:34.165
The feds are all over it now.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.600
I don't got enough on my fuckin' mind?

14:41.700 --> 14:45.500
- Any idea how you're gonna handle that?
- Handle what?

14:45.600 --> 14:48.400
Our cousin, you know, Phil and John.

14:48.435 --> 14:51.200
I don't know, I gotta think about it.

14:53.100 --> 14:57.400
From now on, Paulie supervises
the cigarette run. You split everything with him.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.300
- What?
- You fuckin' heard me.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.565
I got a fuckin' wedding to pay for.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.000
Well, if I were you, I'd cut out the open bar!

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Fuck this piece of shit.
I'm done! You hear me?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.400
Put my life on the line! My fuckin' life!

15:20.435 --> 15:22.500
Baby, I hate seeing you like this.

15:22.535 --> 15:23.965
Fuck family, fuck loyalty.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.050
You cost him a dime, you're a fuckin' pariah.

15:27.085 --> 15:30.100
I gave that fuck pieces of my soul, Adriana.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.300
You know what he said to me?

15:32.400 --> 15:35.300
- He said I should have a fuckin' drink!
- When?

15:35.335 --> 15:38.065
Up there, when we were up
at Uncle Pat's farm.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.500
You don't need to listen to him.
Isn't that why you have a sponsor?

15:41.600 --> 15:44.000
Him and Tony B, breaking my balls,

15:44.100 --> 15:46.300
teasing me like when I was little.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.300
What kind of fucked-up,
undermining shit is that

15:50.335 --> 15:52.900
to tell someone who's got the disease?

15:56.400 --> 16:00.500
You know I could take him out
in a second, that fat fuck. Bang!

16:00.600 --> 16:02.665
His kids wouldn't even give a shit.

16:02.700 --> 16:07.100
Don't talk like that. You're a better man
than he is, a better person.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.100
Fuck all this shit with Paulie.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.565
You know what hurts me worse,
right to my heart?

16:12.600 --> 16:16.400
Him and our ass-wipe cousin,
that two-faced cocksucker.

16:16.435 --> 16:20.200
He could get us all killed with New York
and him...

16:20.300 --> 16:24.100
Tony has to think about
what to do with him now, after all this shit!

16:25.500 --> 16:28.100
Me, he don't need to fuckin' think!

16:29.700 --> 16:31.300
Well, maybe I need to think!

16:32.100 --> 16:35.000
Ever thought of that, you fat fuckin' scumbag?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.100
That's the guy, Adriana.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.300
My uncle Tony.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.900
The guy I'm going to hell for.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.900
- Long Branch cops.
- What do you think?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.400
Not your average bulls... detectives.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.599
Call the Long Branch PD, find out what's up.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.964
So, you all set?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.099
- Don't look at me.
- Why? Ya look good!

17:25.200 --> 17:28.099
And you're gonna look nice
with the short hair.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.900
Like whatshername...

17:31.000 --> 17:34.665
- That actress.
- Just take me home.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.000
I can drop you off, but I really can't stay.

17:37.035 --> 17:38.900
Why not?

17:45.900 --> 17:49.800
All right, look. First off, like I said before,

17:49.900 --> 17:52.800
as far as all the medical bills
and the prescriptions,

17:52.835 --> 17:54.865
that's covered, ad nauseam.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.500
- You motherfucker.
- Hey, take it easy.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.465
This is how you leave me?

18:00.500 --> 18:03.600
I'm almost burned to death
cooking you a fucking snack?

18:03.700 --> 18:06.265
You could've been making yourself something.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.800
- Am I that fuckin' horrible now?
- No. You're not horrible at all.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.700
I'm going back to my wife.

18:14.735 --> 18:16.700
You selfish fuck.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.200
I hate you.

18:22.700 --> 18:26.200
There's just no future with us,
I told you that from the get-go.

18:26.300 --> 18:29.700
That's why I didn't want you hitching
your wagon to my star.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.400
You'll heal up. You'll meet somebody else.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.500
Fuck you!

18:39.100 --> 18:44.700
I didn't come here to fight, I came here to pick
you up and end this like a gentleman.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.300
I'm gonna fuckin' kill myself.

18:49.335 --> 18:51.200
I gotta take this.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.400
Is that you?

19:02.200 --> 19:05.800
I know you're there, just say something.
Where the fuck are...?

19:12.500 --> 19:14.800
Your call cannot be...

19:23.500 --> 19:25.600
- The Bing.
- Yeah, it's me.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.000
Have your friend at the phone company
call me.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.000
- Who, Gerard?
- I want to put traps on all my lines.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.100
Jesus. What?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.500
- We need to talk.
- I was buying medicine.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.100
- This way, please.
- But my car!

20:05.200 --> 20:06.600
Hello?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.400
Give me a hand, will you?

20:11.500 --> 20:14.300
I got more stuff in the car, so...

20:14.400 --> 20:18.100
- Where should I put it?
- In the bedroom.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.200
Oh, you made it.
Hey, I was just starting dinner.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.600
Yeah, it smells good.

20:29.700 --> 20:33.400
- What is this?
- I got you something small.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.400
Oh, this is beautiful!

20:39.500 --> 20:41.300
With my black coat.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.200
It's a Hermès. Supposed to be the best.

21:01.900 --> 21:04.600
There's the whipped butter too, if you like.

21:04.635 --> 21:06.200
This is all right.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.500
This is fuckin' weird.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.200
- AJ...
- No, he's right.

21:19.235 --> 21:21.600
It is fuckin' weird.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.600
You know what? We should celebrate.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.800
Here, give me your glass.

21:35.300 --> 21:38.300
The trick is, you gotta hold the cork,
don't let it fly out.

21:38.335 --> 21:40.500
Gab's uncle got a detached retina

21:40.600 --> 21:43.600
at his retirement party.
He never saw outta that eye again.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.100
That's festive.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.800
I wanna make a toast.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.200
To the people I love.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.300
Nothing else matters.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.700
Hear, hear.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.200
Slow down.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.900
You're supposed to savour it.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.100
It's important in life.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.765
- Open the door for Mr Mucklel
- What?

22:27.800 --> 22:31.400
- Open the door for Mr Muckle the blind man.
- Call 'em off my kumquatsl

22:31.500 --> 22:33.500
- What'd you say?
- Kumquatsl

22:40.800 --> 22:44.300
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's all right. It's all right.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.300
All right.

23:07.900 --> 23:11.000
- So?
- I was throwing the garbage out.

23:11.100 --> 23:16.400
So what? Isn't that illegal anyway,
to film people without telling 'em?

23:16.435 --> 23:20.000
And the reason you didn't just leave
the garbage in the dumpster?

23:20.035 --> 23:22.900
Bills and stuff.
Our account numbers were on it.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.300
- Friend of yours?
- Jesus Christ.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.365
His name is Gilbert Nieves.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.100
Partial traces of an infrared stamp
on his hand from The Crazy Horse.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.465
I don't know him.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.400
You told the police
that he was at the club that night.

23:37.435 --> 23:39.765
Let me ask you
a question, Miss La Cerva.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.800
Do you really think we don't know
what's in that garbage bag?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.465
He was stabbed in the club.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.650
You tried to dispose of the evidence.

23:47.685 --> 23:50.242
- I didn't do nothing.
- Miss La Cerva.

23:50.277 --> 23:52.738
I suggest in the strongest possible terms

23:52.773 --> 23:55.200
that you start telling us what you know.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.500
There's this guy, his name's Matush.

24:08.600 --> 24:13.100
He's a drug dealer.
He did it. I swear, not me.

24:13.900 --> 24:16.000
What's Matush's last name?

24:16.100 --> 24:21.400
I don't know. He's foreign, the Mid East
or something... Pakistan.

24:21.435 --> 24:25.267
Anyway, Christopher don't
let him deal in the club,

24:25.302 --> 24:29.100
but once in a while he'd sell me
some X or whatever.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.600
This is my friend Kamal.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.600
Listen, I need a favour.
We're trying to get an apartment.

24:38.700 --> 24:40.565
I gotta fax a copy of my passport.

24:40.600 --> 24:45.900
- You can't go to Kinko's?
- The guy's waiting. Two seconds, I swear.

24:47.300 --> 24:51.200
It's in the office, but hurry.
If Christopher sees you, he'll shit.

24:51.235 --> 24:53.100
That's for you.

25:08.700 --> 25:12.600
This guy was at the club, the dead guy,
but I never saw him before.

25:12.635 --> 25:14.665
Matush said he sold him coke once,

25:14.700 --> 25:17.800
but the guy said Matush
ripped him off, it was all laxative.

25:17.835 --> 25:19.800
Oh, boy.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.400
What's the number again?

25:24.400 --> 25:26.600
Hey, yo, you can't be back here, man.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.750
Cool out, yo! What are ya doing?

25:28.785 --> 25:30.742
- Give me my money.
- What?

25:30.777 --> 25:32.665
Don't get stupid in here.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.565
Fuck off, I got no beef with you.

25:34.600 --> 25:38.400
You still sell that beat shit, huh?
Fuckin' baby powder?

25:38.435 --> 25:40.400
- Look, I don't know...
- Get him!

25:40.500 --> 25:43.000
I'll kill you motherfuckers! I'll kill you!

26:22.300 --> 26:24.200
Oh, my God!

26:26.800 --> 26:30.300
We had to wait till later to get out
the mops and stuff,

26:30.335 --> 26:32.400
after we closed up.

26:32.500 --> 26:35.200
- If Christopher...
- Nobody has to know anything.

26:35.300 --> 26:38.700
- But you don't fuckin' understand!
- It's cool, OK?

26:38.735 --> 26:41.000
We'll take him out through the basement.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.100
Dump him in the ocean.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.065
Why'd you help this Matush?

26:59.100 --> 27:02.065
I wasn't helping him, I was afraid for myself.

27:02.100 --> 27:06.300
Besides, he's nice. I don't know.
I didn't wanna see him get into trouble.

27:06.335 --> 27:09.700
- Sounds like a real sweetheart.
- The guy was gonna stab him!

27:09.800 --> 27:13.250
He's not a bad person. He's very religious.

27:13.285 --> 27:16.700
- Religious?
- He prays, like, all the time.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.800
He went through a period
of rediscovering his religion.

27:19.835 --> 27:22.365
He don't even do drugs any more,
he just deals.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.800
Every month he sends all
his money home to his family.

27:25.835 --> 27:29.500
- In Pakistan?
- His brother runs a prep school.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.800
Some place for young boys.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.000
I was very impressed with that.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.565
He's buckled down.
He's much more serious as a person.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.765
- Does Christopher know what happened?
- No! Are you crazy?

27:45.800 --> 27:50.500
You're guilty of obstructing an ongoing
investigation into a drug-related homicide.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.600
You are looking at 25 years.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.865
- But I didn't do nothing.
- Take your head out of your ass.

27:55.900 --> 28:00.500
- You knew what you were doing.
- We can arrest you now, have you charged,

28:00.535 --> 28:03.100
send you over
to the women's house of detention.

28:03.135 --> 28:06.400
Or in the alternative you can cooperate.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.665
But I've been fuckin' cooperating!

28:08.700 --> 28:11.865
You've been giving us shit,
and I've had it!

28:11.900 --> 28:15.650
I want you wired up!
I want Tony Soprano on tape!

28:15.685 --> 28:19.400
- Your boyfriend too!
- No, I'm not doing it!

28:19.500 --> 28:21.200
Then you're all out of options!

28:25.000 --> 28:27.300
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.365
Fine, who's your lawyer?

28:30.400 --> 28:32.765
I don't have an official one.

28:32.800 --> 28:37.700
- Maybe Christopher knows a good lawyer.
- Oh, you fuckin' piece of shit.

28:37.735 --> 28:41.000
I'll call the Public Defender,
they'll send someone down.

28:41.035 --> 28:44.700
Might take awhile, though,
this hour of the night.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.000
I think I left some shoes over there.

29:00.300 --> 29:03.200
I can iron these tomorrow.

29:03.300 --> 29:06.800
- What for? Send 'em to the cleaners.
- I kinda miss it actually.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.200
My wrist is getting weak.

29:11.600 --> 29:15.900
- I could help you there.
- Get outta here.

29:17.800 --> 29:21.500
No, let's give it some exercise.

29:21.535 --> 29:23.400
- What?
- Stop.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
Hi, it's Ade. Ma, if this is you, another gift
for the registry could be a decanter.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.800
It's me. Where are you?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.900
We may be doing it at our house.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.265
We've only got the one leaf for 16 people.

29:57.300 --> 30:01.300
Could you do a buffet? Maybe set a card table
up for the kids?

30:01.335 --> 30:04.300
It's our first holiday.
Ronnie wants us all together.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.200
Ade? It's been 40 minutes.
How long you gonna stay in there?

30:19.235 --> 30:21.665
How long will you let me go
without a lawyer?

30:21.700 --> 30:25.700
I told you, they're backed up.
We left four messages.

30:25.735 --> 30:28.500
Eight fuckin' hours I've been here already.

30:44.100 --> 30:48.400
- Jesus Christ, look at me.
- You want some coffee?

30:49.300 --> 30:51.200
I can't, my stomach.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.500
I wish you'd think about our offer.
It's not a bad deal.

30:57.300 --> 31:02.100
I won't wear a wire, I told you. It's bad enough
how I betrayed him already.

31:02.135 --> 31:05.500
It's not too late to have a future, Ade.
There are other options.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.700
Don't start with
the Witness Protection again.

31:08.735 --> 31:11.300
You love each other. You have your health.

31:11.335 --> 31:12.500
Yeah, right.

31:12.600 --> 31:16.400
Living like this
is what's costing you your insides.

31:18.900 --> 31:23.400
- I really need a cigarette.
- OK. Come on.

32:02.500 --> 32:06.800
There's no way she'll wear a wire,
but she might get Moltisanti to flip.

32:06.835 --> 32:09.000
- Why now?
- Problems with Tony.

32:09.100 --> 32:12.365
- Christopher hates him.
- That's confirmed by wiretaps.

32:12.400 --> 32:16.400
Cl12 mentioned it too. Something to do
with Tony Blundetto, the cousin.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.265
- What would Moltisanti want?
- I'm not sure.

32:19.300 --> 32:23.300
- He's got some interest in screenwriting.
- Put in a call to Sam Goldwyn.

32:23.335 --> 32:24.865
Promise her anything?

32:24.900 --> 32:29.700
Depending on what he's offering, maybe
immunity and relocation for the two of them.

32:34.900 --> 32:37.700
She's got to understand
that if she won't wear a wire,

32:37.800 --> 32:40.365
we can't offer her protection or surveillance.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.800
- I explained all that.
- She's got till 9am Monday

32:43.835 --> 32:47.200
to bring him in or we turn her over
to Long Branch PD.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.400
Tone, you got a call.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.000
Jimmy Petrille, Brooklyn.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.365
- Hello.
- It's me.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.500
That tennis match with those guys?
My guy won.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.600
- Oh, yeah?
- The other one, the son.

33:06.635 --> 33:08.767
- He dropped out.
- What, he got hurt?

33:08.802 --> 33:10.900
Nothing like that. Settled, that's all.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.800
All right.

33:16.200 --> 33:19.365
- Little Carmine's out.
- He's dead?

33:19.400 --> 33:22.400
Seems like him and Johnny worked out a deal.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.600
I knew he'd cave. He's a fuckin' pussy, that kid.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.865
Johnny Sack, boss of a family.

33:28.900 --> 33:32.300
Time was it would've been great
for us to have John as the boss.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.700
Smart as a fuckin' whip.
He used to be a pragmatist.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.765
Some people are better at being number twos.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.900
You thought John had an ego before?
Forget it now.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.065
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

34:01.100 --> 34:05.800
- So where the fuck you been?
- Christopher, we need to talk.

34:05.900 --> 34:09.300
- I asked you a question, Adriana.
- I know.

34:09.335 --> 34:11.400
There's something I need to tell you.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.199
- It's that fuckin' Bobby DeMarco?
- No!

34:14.300 --> 34:16.300
Please, Christopher.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.699
I gotta get through this.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.264
About a year ago...

34:27.300 --> 34:29.699
more maybe, I don't know...

34:31.400 --> 34:35.000
- I was arrested.
- For what? What are you talking about?

34:35.034 --> 34:38.500
- For drugs.
- Where, at the club?

34:40.300 --> 34:43.800
- You remember my friend Danielle?
- She set you up?

34:43.900 --> 34:46.500
She was an FBI agent, Christopher.

34:59.700 --> 35:03.100
She lied to me. They wanted
to arrest you too, Christopher.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.765
I was just trying to protect you.

35:05.800 --> 35:09.700
They said all they wanted was some
information and they would leave us alone.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.150
I didn't tell them nothing, I swear to God...

35:13.185 --> 35:16.500
Just licence plates, some other stupid shit.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.665
They wanted me to wear a wire,
but I wouldn't do it.

35:19.700 --> 35:25.900
But now there was a murder, Christopher,
and they know about it.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.800
At the club, Matush and some other guy.

35:30.800 --> 35:34.600
I tried to cover it up, but I had no choice.

35:34.635 --> 35:38.400
They've been filming us in the parking lot.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.965
We're dead, you know that?

35:54.000 --> 35:59.300
What did you do, huh?
How could you fuckin' do this to us?

36:05.100 --> 36:06.900
I fuckin' loved you!

36:15.800 --> 36:17.800
I'm sorry.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.600
My God!

36:36.900 --> 36:39.200
What are we gonna do?

36:49.700 --> 36:51.700
Careful here, my son.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.100
- Hello.
- T, it's me.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.300
You awake?

37:13.200 --> 37:14.800
I know you're mad, OK?

37:16.500 --> 37:19.100
I'm sorry.
When I heard about Angelo I just...

37:19.200 --> 37:21.200
Don't say it. Not on the phone.

37:21.235 --> 37:23.200
I know, I won't.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.600
- What should I do?
- I'll tell you what not to do.

37:29.700 --> 37:33.000
- That's come back around here.
- I know.

37:33.035 --> 37:36.000
I know, but... my kids, my boys.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.000
Don't worry. I'll look after them.

37:38.100 --> 37:41.100
Yeah, well, that's...
that's why I'm calling, to ask...

37:41.200 --> 37:43.700
Sure, why not?

37:44.700 --> 37:47.500
Anything else I can do for you?

37:47.600 --> 37:50.200
I don't know what to say, cuz.

37:50.300 --> 37:52.300
I'm leaving you with shit in your lap.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.800
- Hello?
- The night you went away,

38:02.835 --> 38:04.800
you know, 17 years ago,

38:04.900 --> 38:09.100
I told you that I got jumped
by a couple of shines.

38:10.900 --> 38:12.900
That's why I didn't show.

38:12.935 --> 38:14.800
It was all bullshit.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.465
I got in a fight with my mother and passed out.

38:19.500 --> 38:23.765
- What do you mean?
- I don't know. It was like a panic attack.

38:23.800 --> 38:28.800
I went down like a house of cards
and I cracked my fuckin' skull open.

38:28.835 --> 38:30.865
Why are you telling me all this?

38:30.900 --> 38:34.700
I felt guilty about it all these years,
like it was my fault you went away.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.465
Anyway, now we're even.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.800
So the casino, all that shit you did
for me is cos of that?

38:49.800 --> 38:53.200
You just take care of yourself, all right?

38:53.235 --> 38:55.100
You too.

39:11.700 --> 39:13.700
Hello?

39:13.800 --> 39:15.800
Gerard, it's me.

39:16.500 --> 39:20.700
- He just called.
- Give me a sec, I'll dump the line.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.765
- You got a pen?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

39:25.800 --> 39:30.700
He's at Roy's. It's a business, Kinderhook,
New York. That's upstate.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.100
Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.200
- Hello?
- Uncle Pat.

39:52.300 --> 39:56.100
- How's life at the old folks' home?
- I don't like the people here.

39:56.135 --> 39:59.900
- Do you know what time it is?
- I thought you were a night owl.

40:00.900 --> 40:04.000
Did I hear a rumour there was a problem
up there at the farm?

40:04.035 --> 40:07.465
The goddamn developer.
Some environmental crap.

40:07.500 --> 40:11.600
They can't start the demolition
without some special permit.

40:11.635 --> 40:14.200
And the house is sitting there empty,
damn it.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.500
Remember that... that time at Lake George,

40:18.535 --> 40:20.100
how you loved it?

40:20.200 --> 40:23.065
We could live someplace like that, maybe.

40:23.100 --> 40:27.200
- You could start writing again.
- I could do my memoirs, finally.

40:28.900 --> 40:31.700
And we'd have a fireplace like you like too.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.200
We could never come back here, Adriana.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.400
I don't wanna come back. I just want you.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.800
You couldn't even see your mother again.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.300
You want some eggs?

40:50.300 --> 40:52.300
I need to clear my head.

40:54.700 --> 40:57.800
- You didn't even sleep.
- This is a lot to process.

40:57.835 --> 41:01.400
I gotta think. I'll be back in a little while.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.765
Stay, wait.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.300
I'm gonna get cigarettes. I'll be right back.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.465
Smoke mine. Don't smoke.

41:07.500 --> 41:11.700
- Next you're gonna want a vodka.
- What? Come on.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
I love you, baby.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.600
I love you.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.100
Hello.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.100
- He wants to do it.
- Great, when are you coming in?

41:41.135 --> 41:43.600
A couple hours.
We'll get some things together.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.565
That's not what we said, Ade.

41:45.600 --> 41:49.000
Please, if I push him he'll say no.
I know how he is.

41:52.100 --> 41:55.000
I'm serious, Adriana. You've got till one o'clock.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.900
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

43:03.900 --> 43:06.500
Look, everything's OK.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.300
Jesus, I don't even know how to say this.

43:12.700 --> 43:15.700
It's Christopher. He tried to commit suicide.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.600
- My God, is he all right?
- He's fine.

43:18.700 --> 43:21.650
He was up by Ramapo,
apparently he took some pills.

43:21.685 --> 43:24.600
A trooper found him in a bathroom of this diner.

43:24.635 --> 43:26.500
They brought him to the hospital.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.900
His mom's on her way up there now.

43:28.935 --> 43:31.217
Did he say anything to you?

43:31.252 --> 43:33.500
I mean, did he appear suicidal?

43:33.535 --> 43:35.700
- No.
- Are you sure?

43:36.600 --> 43:39.200
His mom said he's
very upset about something.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.965
Anyway, I'm on my way up there now.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.600
I'm gonna send Sil by to pick you up then, OK?

43:45.700 --> 43:48.100
- Jesus Christ.
- You know he's been drinking.

43:48.200 --> 43:51.100
He's probably fighting that heroin urge again.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.200
- Anyway, Sil's on his way.
- OK.

43:54.300 --> 43:57.600
All right. I'll see ya up there.

44:46.900 --> 44:50.500
I'd stop to eat, but I don't wanna
get to the hospital after Tony.

44:50.535 --> 44:52.500
I'm not hungry.

45:06.600 --> 45:10.000
They'll keep him a few days, maybe.

45:10.035 --> 45:13.100
Observation, do some tests,

45:13.200 --> 45:15.400
who knows?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.600
He's a strong kid.

45:44.400 --> 45:48.100
He's tough, very resilient.

46:02.500 --> 46:05.000
Why are you crying? He's gonna be fine.

46:44.900 --> 46:47.100
- No, please!
- Come on. Come on.

46:47.135 --> 46:49.300
- Where you fuckin' going?
- Please!

46:49.335 --> 46:52.100
Come on, come on! Fuckin' cunt!

46:52.200 --> 46:54.100
- Please! No.
- Come out of there.

48:02.900 --> 48:05.800
This is long-term parking only.

48:05.900 --> 48:11.100
Due to increased security,
cars being reclaimed in less than 14 days

48:11.200 --> 48:14.500
must be left in lots L, M or N.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.600
This is long-term parking only.

48:18.700 --> 48:24.100
Due to increased security,
cars being reclaimed in less than 14 days

48:24.200 --> 48:27.600
must be left in lots L, M or N.

48:38.800 --> 48:41.000
The King of New York.

48:44.200 --> 48:46.300
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Tony.

48:46.335 --> 48:48.500
You deserve it.

48:49.800 --> 48:54.700
I want you to know this is the last time
we'll meet like this. It's undignified.

49:00.400 --> 49:04.100
So, what's the word on your cousin?

49:10.900 --> 49:13.300
I think I know where he's holed up.

49:16.600 --> 49:17.665
And?

49:17.700 --> 49:20.300
I know this has to be done, John,

49:20.400 --> 49:23.800
but I'm asking you now as a friend.

49:25.200 --> 49:28.800
- Let me handle this myself.
- I can't do that, Tony.

49:31.300 --> 49:34.700
You can do whatever the fuck you want,
you're the fuckin' boss.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.900
I choose not to, then.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.165
I want your promise it'll be quick.

49:47.200 --> 49:49.900
I'm not gonna lie to you, Tony, I don't have to.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.200
Phil's gonna do it, and he'll do it his way.

49:57.500 --> 50:01.400
This is me now. Come on.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.900
Anything else?

50:08.300 --> 50:09.900
No.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.400
You know what, John? I'll give you undignified.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.800
Go fuck yourself.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.800
You and Phil and whoever.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.700
He's my fuckin' cousin.

51:21.400 --> 51:25.400
- You all right?
- This is some funny shit.

51:30.300 --> 51:32.300
What the fuck is wrong with you?

51:38.500 --> 51:40.400
I snorted a little H.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.900
I know, but...

51:47.100 --> 51:50.700
I can't stand the pain. I loved her.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.600
Fuckin' pain, huh?

52:01.400 --> 52:03.700
You think you're alone in this?

52:03.800 --> 52:06.500
It was a judgment call. She sounded OK.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.265
The status on Moltisanti?

52:08.300 --> 52:10.565
Seen yesterday leaving the Bing with Tony.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.265
- Should we bring him in?
- That'll get us nothing.

52:13.300 --> 52:17.100
She really could have fled.
She could be in China by now.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
How should we handle the Nieves murder?

52:33.035 --> 52:34.965
We have the terror possibility.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.600
Take it over from the Long Branch PD.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.700
Well, what did I say, is it beautiful?

53:29.700 --> 53:31.700
Yeah, it's a gorgeous piece of land.

53:32.700 --> 53:36.600
With this view, it's well worth 600,000.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.100
The surveyor's coming on Tuesday.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
- You all right?
- Yeah. Me? Yeah.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.600
Absolutely.

56:24.600 --> 56:25.600
