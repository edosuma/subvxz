WEBVTT

00:02.710 --> 00:04.728
Hey, want to spend
some time playing the new

00:04.730 --> 00:06.029
<i>Star Wars</i> game
this weekend?

00:06.031 --> 00:08.048
Oh, I don't know.
I kind of promised myself

00:08.050 --> 00:10.484
I'd get off the computer,
be more physically active.

00:10.486 --> 00:11.702
Get some exercise...

00:11.704 --> 00:14.738
You're about to walk up
three flights of stairs.

00:16.858 --> 00:19.376
Good point, I'm in.

00:19.378 --> 00:20.961
KOOTHRAPPALI:
You know what would be great?

00:20.963 --> 00:23.247
Let's do it
like the old days.

00:23.249 --> 00:25.198
You mean, are you talking
gaming marathon?

00:25.200 --> 00:27.000
Yeah. Start Saturday morning,

00:27.002 --> 00:28.368
go 48 hours,

00:28.370 --> 00:30.337
sleeping bags,
junk food...

00:30.339 --> 00:33.039
Turn off our phones
so our moms can't call.

00:35.343 --> 00:37.644
It would be like our <i>World Of</i>
<i>Warcraft</i> a few years ago

00:37.646 --> 00:39.313
when the neighbors
called the cops on us.

00:39.315 --> 00:40.814
(both chuckle)

00:40.816 --> 00:42.182
They called the cops
because of the smell.

00:42.184 --> 00:44.384
They thought we were dead.

00:46.888 --> 00:49.389
We were badass back in the day.

00:51.409 --> 00:52.776
All right, let's do it.

00:52.778 --> 00:54.828
48 hours of <i>Star Wars</i> gaming.

00:54.830 --> 00:56.914
It's on like Alderaan.

00:56.916 --> 00:58.499
(all laugh)

00:58.501 --> 01:00.334
Hey, Sheldon,

01:00.336 --> 01:02.085
clear your weekend.
Starting Saturday morning,

01:02.087 --> 01:03.587
<i>Star Wars</i> marathon
Whoohoo!

01:03.589 --> 01:05.372
Movies or video games?

01:05.373 --> 01:06.440
No, board game?

01:06.442 --> 01:07.574
Or trading card games?

01:07.576 --> 01:09.126
Or <i>Lego's?</i> Or dress up?

01:09.128 --> 01:10.210
Or comic books?!

01:10.212 --> 01:11.995
Or dramatic readings
of novelizations?!

01:11.997 --> 01:14.581
Yes to all!

01:14.583 --> 01:18.101
We are going to play
the online game.

01:18.103 --> 01:19.353
The online game?!

01:19.355 --> 01:21.638
Bully!

01:21.640 --> 01:24.308
Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure
Sheldon would enjoy

01:24.310 --> 01:26.193
playing intergalactic
make-believe,

01:26.195 --> 01:27.611
he and I have other plans.

01:27.613 --> 01:30.380
We are attending my Aunt Flora's
93rd birthday party.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.699
Just tell her I can't come.

01:32.701 --> 01:35.101
She'll be disappointed
if we don't show up.

01:35.103 --> 01:36.703
She's 93.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.272
She won't be disappointed
for very long.

01:40.258 --> 01:42.993
No, hang on.
I followed all the protocols

01:42.995 --> 01:44.962
set forth by you in the
relationship agreement.

01:44.964 --> 01:48.549
I made a written record request
72 hours in advance.

01:49.450 --> 01:51.618
I checked the tire pressure
on the car.

01:51.620 --> 01:53.921
I even contacted the Centers
For Disease Control to find out

01:53.923 --> 01:57.174
what shots they recommend
for travel to Orange County.

01:58.092 --> 02:00.844
FYI, it's none.

02:00.846 --> 02:02.729
Amy, the relationship
agreement was not designed

02:02.731 --> 02:05.816
for either one of us
to get our way.

02:05.818 --> 02:07.768
You use it to get your way.

02:07.770 --> 02:10.187
I use it to
get the right way.

02:11.322 --> 02:12.856
The fact that
the right way is

02:12.858 --> 02:15.075
also my way is
a happy coincidence.

02:16.628 --> 02:17.978
You gave me your word.

02:17.980 --> 02:19.196
You're coming with me.

02:19.198 --> 02:20.397
We'll miss you, Sheldon.

02:20.399 --> 02:22.148
Yeah, well,

02:22.150 --> 02:24.117
who wants to spend the whole
weekend, running around

02:24.119 --> 02:26.920
a bunch of pretend planets
battling made up monsters.

02:26.922 --> 02:29.172
That's for babies.

02:29.174 --> 02:30.757
Yeah, but it's got lightsabers.

02:30.759 --> 02:34.428
Yeah, please, Amy!
It's got lightsabers!

02:58.307 --> 03:01.807
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

03:03.876 --> 03:05.810
- Hello Stuart.
- Hey Sheldon.

03:05.835 --> 03:06.946
Help you with anything?

03:06.971 --> 03:11.683
Yes. I'm attending a party this
weekend, for a 93-year-old woman.

03:12.971 --> 03:14.552
Can you recommend a gift?

03:15.738 --> 03:18.239
Uh, I don't know.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.887
Could put a tennis ball
on the end of Excalibur.

03:20.888 --> 03:23.088
Make a pretty badass cane.

03:24.559 --> 03:26.644
Do you supply the the tennis balls?
No.

03:26.646 --> 03:27.995
Then no.

03:29.714 --> 03:30.598
What else?

03:30.600 --> 03:31.765
Hmm...

03:31.767 --> 03:34.902
Oh, have this collectors edition

03:34.904 --> 03:36.236
Batman utility belt.

03:36.238 --> 03:39.490
Maybe she can use it as a
wearable pill caddy.

03:40.942 --> 03:43.243
Well, she'd just look silly
wearing that

03:43.245 --> 03:44.728
without the rest of the costume.

03:47.699 --> 03:50.117
I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it.
That's all I got.

03:50.119 --> 03:51.234
Oh, it's not your fault.

03:51.236 --> 03:52.953
I've been to the
model train store.

03:52.955 --> 03:54.571
I've been to Radio Shack.

03:54.573 --> 03:57.124
This woman is
impossible to shop for.

03:57.126 --> 04:00.010
I'd make fun of Sheldon
for having girl problems

04:00.012 --> 04:03.280
if I wasn't in shock that
Sheldon has girl problems.

04:03.282 --> 04:06.249
No, Leonard,
go ahead and mock.

04:06.251 --> 04:09.837
Like my daddy always said,
"Shelly, women aren't anything

04:09.839 --> 04:12.006
but flippin' pains
in the bottom."

04:14.209 --> 04:15.809
That's what your
father used to say?

04:15.811 --> 04:18.896
Well, I took out the
bad words and the yeehaw,

04:18.898 --> 04:20.947
but you get the gist.

04:21.866 --> 04:23.200
Look, if you don't want to go

04:23.202 --> 04:24.601
to the party, just don't go.

04:24.603 --> 04:25.602
You're a grown man.

04:25.604 --> 04:26.937
Act like one.

04:26.939 --> 04:29.623
Tell Amy you want to spend
the weekend having a sleepover

04:29.625 --> 04:31.875
and playing video games
with your friends.

04:32.877 --> 04:34.328
Maybe she'll dig it.

04:34.330 --> 04:37.214
Women like a firm hand
on the tiller.

04:37.216 --> 04:39.066
I can never find the tiller.

04:41.920 --> 04:45.422
I got a book; it didn't help.

04:45.424 --> 04:48.175
Yeah, I always thought
if I were ever enslaved,

04:48.177 --> 04:51.428
it would be by an advanced
species from another planet,

04:51.430 --> 04:55.149
not some hotsy-totsy
from Glendale.

04:55.151 --> 04:57.351
Now, I downloaded an app that

04:57.353 --> 05:00.487
might be helpful
in this situation.

05:00.489 --> 05:01.271
(whip cracks)

05:01.273 --> 05:04.975
(all laugh)

05:04.977 --> 05:06.844
You're right.

05:06.846 --> 05:10.214
I'm smart as a whip. I should
be able to figure this out.

05:13.317 --> 05:15.285
Hey, listen,
I kind of made plans

05:15.287 --> 05:17.588
with the guys this weekend,
but then I wondered,

05:17.590 --> 05:19.673
because we're in this
relationship-beta-test,

05:19.675 --> 05:21.508
if I should have
asked you first.

05:21.510 --> 05:24.461
Then I thought
if I did check with you first,

05:24.463 --> 05:27.548
then you'd think that I was
taking things to seriously.

05:27.550 --> 05:30.000
And then-en I got a nosebleed.

05:30.002 --> 05:32.553
You don't have to check with me.

05:32.555 --> 05:34.555
Do whatever you want.

05:34.557 --> 05:36.223
Oh.

05:36.225 --> 05:39.109
I guess I was hoping for a
different reaction, but okay.

05:39.111 --> 05:41.145
Really, what were
you hoping for?

05:41.147 --> 05:42.529
I don't know,

05:42.531 --> 05:44.531
maybe that you'd
be a little upset,

05:44.533 --> 05:46.617
and then you'd realize that

05:46.619 --> 05:48.869
I'm a stallion
that has to run free.

05:52.791 --> 05:55.242
And that would
turn you on a little.

05:55.244 --> 05:59.029
Okay, I'm an actress.
Ask me again.

05:59.031 --> 06:01.298
Do you mind
if I spend the weekend

06:01.300 --> 06:02.916
playing video games
with the guys?

06:02.918 --> 06:04.885
Wha... the entire weekend?

06:04.887 --> 06:06.553
You mean I wouldn't
see you at all?

06:06.555 --> 06:07.504
But I j...

06:07.506 --> 06:08.371
No, no...

06:08.373 --> 06:11.058
I knew what I was getting into.

06:11.060 --> 06:14.378
You can't put a saddle
on Leonard Hofstadter.

06:16.231 --> 06:18.882
Oh, my, is it getting hot
in here?

06:18.884 --> 06:21.185
<i>Ay,papi.</i>

06:21.187 --> 06:24.071
<i>¿Ay</i> <i>papi?</i>

06:24.073 --> 06:25.489
(chuckles)
What is that?

06:25.491 --> 06:27.875
- An acting choice.
- Oh.

06:27.877 --> 06:30.277
So you chose that when
you become turned on,

06:30.279 --> 06:33.163
you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?

06:33.165 --> 06:36.817
<i>Choo</i> got a problem
with that, <i>papi?</i>

06:37.752 --> 06:39.286
Uh-uh.

06:39.288 --> 06:43.173
(knocking)
SHELDON: Penny! Penny! Penny!

06:43.175 --> 06:44.458
Sorry, Stallion.

06:44.460 --> 06:46.710
Your weird friend
Giraffe is here.

06:48.847 --> 06:50.413
Hello, Penny!

06:50.415 --> 06:53.133
I just stopped by to
bring you this gift.

06:53.135 --> 06:54.751
Gummy bears?
Thank you.

06:54.753 --> 06:56.753
Now that you're
in my debt...

06:58.256 --> 07:00.924
...please manipulate Amy
into releasing me from my

07:00.926 --> 07:04.478
commitment to attend her
aunt's tedious birthday party.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.729
Not a chance.

07:05.731 --> 07:06.980
All right.

07:06.982 --> 07:08.615
I thought the candy
might not be enough

07:08.617 --> 07:10.818
so let me up the ante.
(clears throat)

07:10.820 --> 07:12.820
These are Cooper Coupons.

07:12.822 --> 07:15.906
These are for various things
I can do for you.

07:15.908 --> 07:17.407
Um, oh, this one

07:17.409 --> 07:19.626
is for one free grammar check.

07:19.628 --> 07:21.161
Uh...

07:21.163 --> 07:23.330
You could use it for emails,
letters,

07:23.332 --> 07:24.665
tattoos, what have you.

07:24.667 --> 07:26.333
Um...

07:26.335 --> 07:27.751
Oh, this is fun one!

07:27.753 --> 07:31.138
This is an afternoon with me at
the California Science Center,

07:31.140 --> 07:34.141
where I point out
their mistakes.

07:34.143 --> 07:36.960
Keep an eye on
those expiration dates,

07:36.962 --> 07:39.062
I've been burned
more than once.

07:39.064 --> 07:41.515
All right, sweetie,
I'm not going to get involved

07:41.517 --> 07:42.649
in your relationship.

07:42.651 --> 07:45.018
Oh, come on.
It's just a simple favor.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.153
Now, when's the last time
I asked you

07:46.155 --> 07:47.154
to do something for me?

07:47.156 --> 07:49.356
Yesterday. You made me
look in your ear

07:49.358 --> 07:51.358
to see if there was
a ladybug in it.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.311
When is the last time
I asked you to do something

07:54.313 --> 07:55.645
that wasn't a medical emergency?

07:55.647 --> 07:57.364
Yesterday. You made me
look in your ear

07:57.366 --> 07:59.566
to see if there was
a ladybug in it.

08:00.818 --> 08:02.336
All right, then,
I have no choice

08:02.338 --> 08:03.653
but to go on to plan B.

08:03.655 --> 08:04.821
What's that?

08:04.823 --> 08:05.989
I'm going to run around outside

08:05.991 --> 08:07.991
with a wet head and
try to catch a cold.

08:12.213 --> 08:13.430
Good morning.

08:13.432 --> 08:15.098
Hello.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.384
I think you're really
going to enjoy yourself today.

08:17.386 --> 08:19.052
Not only do you get
to meet my relatives,

08:19.054 --> 08:21.438
but since you aunt's nursing
home is catering the party,

08:21.440 --> 08:23.056
all of the food
is incredibly soft.

08:23.058 --> 08:25.442
It's like a vacation
for your teeth.

08:25.444 --> 08:27.010
All right.

08:28.679 --> 08:30.314
You sure you're
okay with this?

08:30.316 --> 08:31.698
Yes.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.034
I decided to find
a way that I could

08:34.035 --> 08:36.519
have this experience
and enjoy it.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.323
Thank you. That
means a lot to me.

08:39.325 --> 08:40.741
Oh, don't thank me.

08:40.743 --> 08:42.192
Thank wireless technology.

08:42.193 --> 08:45.462
I realized, I can go
to your aunt's awful party

08:45.464 --> 08:49.633
and still spend the whole day
gaming with my friends.

08:49.635 --> 08:52.753
Sheldon, my relatives are going
to want to talk to you,

08:52.755 --> 08:55.472
and you're going to be sitting
there playing a game?

08:55.474 --> 08:57.090
Isn't that a
little rude?

08:57.092 --> 08:59.226
Oh, I got that covered.

08:59.228 --> 09:00.928
Headset.

09:00.930 --> 09:03.847
I won't hear a word
the old geezers are saying.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.069
You know, if playing that game
is more important to you

09:09.071 --> 09:10.520
than honoring your
commitment to me,

09:10.522 --> 09:12.906
and you don't mind me showing up
at a party all by myself

09:12.908 --> 09:14.057
after I've already told
everybody

09:14.059 --> 09:16.159
I'll be bringing somebody,
then, fine.

09:16.161 --> 09:17.661
Go home and play your game.

09:17.663 --> 09:19.529
(engine starts)

09:20.164 --> 09:21.531
Thanks.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.234
Ooh, listen,

09:24.236 --> 09:27.421
I wouldn't mind
a piece of birthday cake,

09:27.423 --> 09:32.075
provided the old gal's
candle blow is clean and dry.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:42.950 --> 09:44.309
Here you go.

09:44.310 --> 09:46.560
I've got everything
we'll need for the big game:

09:46.562 --> 09:49.062
lowfat turkey jerky...

09:49.064 --> 09:52.299
low-carb beer...

09:52.301 --> 09:55.102
100-calorie snack pack...

09:55.104 --> 09:57.854
You pick up a Y chromosome
while you were there?

09:57.856 --> 09:59.439
You might be short one.

09:59.441 --> 10:02.059
Hey, I plan on leveling up
in the game,

10:02.061 --> 10:05.195
not my swimsuit size,
thank you very much.

10:05.197 --> 10:07.480
Gentlemen, the game
offers us a choice,

10:07.482 --> 10:10.334
between playing for the Republic
and the light side,

10:10.336 --> 10:13.420
or the Sith Empire
and the dark side.

10:13.422 --> 10:14.871
Well, we're always
the good guys.

10:14.873 --> 10:16.373
In D&D, we're lawful good,

10:16.375 --> 10:18.058
in City Of Heroes,
we're the heroes,

10:18.060 --> 10:20.928
and Grand Theft Auto,
we pay the prostitutes promptly,

10:20.930 --> 10:22.996
and never hit them with a bat.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.990
Those women are prostitutes?

10:29.387 --> 10:32.589
You said they were raising money
for stem cell research.

10:34.392 --> 10:37.427
Hey, guys, I got a surprise.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.780
Uh, if it's yogurt
that helps ladies poop,

10:39.782 --> 10:41.782
I think Raj beat you to it.

10:41.784 --> 10:45.035
No. Bernadette's
going to be playing with us.

10:45.037 --> 10:48.488
So, that's pretty cool, huh?
Right? Sure it is, yeah.

10:48.490 --> 10:51.358
What, you invited
your girlfriend?!

10:51.360 --> 10:53.360
This is supposed
to be our weekend!

10:54.008 --> 10:56.141
I had no choice.
Last night, she said,

10:56.143 --> 10:57.443
"Why don't we go out
for brunch tomorrow

10:57.445 --> 10:59.728
and then maybe the Arboretum."
And I said, "Well, no,

10:59.730 --> 11:01.063
"I promised the guys
I was going to play

11:01.065 --> 11:02.531
a video game with them
all weekend."

11:02.533 --> 11:04.400
And she said, "That sounds
like fun. Can I come, too?"

11:04.402 --> 11:06.285
And then I didn't answer
for a second, and then she said,

11:06.287 --> 11:07.620
"Well, do you not
want me to come?"

11:07.622 --> 11:09.187
And then I bought her
a new laptop and the game,

11:09.189 --> 11:11.273
and she's parking
the car right now.

11:12.742 --> 11:14.660
Is the whip sound app

11:14.662 --> 11:16.629
contextually
appropriate here?

11:16.631 --> 11:19.581
Uh, it is, but I think
you might've waited too long

11:19.583 --> 11:21.000
for it to be funny.

11:21.002 --> 11:25.654
(whip cracks)
(laughter)

11:25.656 --> 11:27.973
(laughing):
I was wrong; it's still funny.

11:27.975 --> 11:29.391
Oh, good.

11:29.393 --> 11:31.710
(high-pitched laugh)

11:35.381 --> 11:36.649
Oh.

11:36.651 --> 11:38.984
Amy, what's wrong?

11:38.986 --> 11:40.719
My boyfriend's a jerk.

11:41.688 --> 11:43.405
Well, I know he didn't
cheat on you,

11:43.407 --> 11:44.657
so what happened?

11:45.692 --> 11:48.577
I had to go to my aunt's
party all by myself,

11:48.579 --> 11:50.112
and everybody was like,

11:50.114 --> 11:51.613
"Where's this boyfriend
you're always talking about?

11:51.615 --> 11:54.033
"Is he real, or did you
make him up like Armen,

11:54.035 --> 11:57.036
the miniature horse breeder?"

11:57.038 --> 11:59.788
Who's Armen the
miniature horse breeder?

11:59.790 --> 12:03.075
The pretend boyfriend I invented
to get my family off my back.

12:03.077 --> 12:05.260
It unraveled quickly when
I couldn't answer the question

12:05.262 --> 12:07.763
"How'd you two meet?"

12:07.765 --> 12:10.582
I would have thought
at a miniature horse show.

12:10.584 --> 12:13.085
- Oh, that's good.
- Mm.

12:13.087 --> 12:16.121
I panicked and said Woodstock.

12:16.123 --> 12:17.306
(sighs)

12:17.308 --> 12:20.192
I just wanted to show Sheldon
off to my family.

12:20.194 --> 12:21.443
Sure, I get that.

12:21.445 --> 12:23.762
I mean, he's your first
boyfriend and all.

12:23.764 --> 12:25.981
Not just my first boyfriend,
he's the best boyfriend.

12:25.983 --> 12:27.649
I mean, think about it.

12:27.651 --> 12:30.085
I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.

12:32.438 --> 12:33.572
Yes.

12:33.574 --> 12:36.158
On purpose.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.793
He's handsome, he's lanky,

12:37.795 --> 12:39.545
he's brilliant,

12:39.547 --> 12:43.365
and his skin has that pale,
waxy quality.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.868
Well, sickly is the new sexy.

12:48.538 --> 12:51.240
- Yeah.
- Mm.

12:51.242 --> 12:52.775
You know, Amy,

12:52.777 --> 12:55.427
sometimes when you're in
a relationship with someone

12:55.429 --> 12:57.312
you really care about,
the sucky part is,

12:57.314 --> 12:58.931
it leaves you open
to getting hurt.

12:58.933 --> 13:01.767
Do you ever worry about
Leonard doing that to you?

13:01.769 --> 13:04.586
(laughs)
That's hilarious. No.

13:06.806 --> 13:08.574
Get that guy!
Get that guy!

13:08.576 --> 13:11.309
Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!

13:12.162 --> 13:13.095
Dr. Rostenkowski,

13:13.097 --> 13:14.496
it may interest
you to know

13:14.498 --> 13:17.199
that saying "pew, pew, pew"
isn't as effective

13:17.201 --> 13:19.668
as pressing your
blaster key.

13:19.670 --> 13:21.754
In the same way
that saying "whee!"

13:21.756 --> 13:24.206
doesn't make the
land speeder go.

13:25.992 --> 13:28.177
Pew!

13:29.629 --> 13:31.263
Raj, Imperial Troopers
on your tail.

13:31.265 --> 13:32.881
(groaning): Got him.

13:32.883 --> 13:35.768
When Gandhi advocated his
philosophy of non-violence,

13:35.770 --> 13:39.922
I bet he didn't know how much
fun it was killing stuff.

13:39.924 --> 13:42.507
All right, I think
we got them all.

13:42.509 --> 13:44.109
Let's divide up the loot.

13:44.111 --> 13:46.645
BERNADETTE: Ooh, look at this
pretty purple robe I just got.

13:46.647 --> 13:49.114
You should put on yours
and then we'll match.

13:49.116 --> 13:52.017
But I worked hard
to get this armor.

13:52.019 --> 13:53.535
Sorry, I just thought
it'd be nice

13:53.537 --> 13:56.705
if people knew
we were a couple.

13:56.707 --> 13:58.690
Fine, I'll change.

13:59.626 --> 14:02.394
(whip cracks)

14:06.166 --> 14:07.883
(high-pitched laugh)

14:11.805 --> 14:13.581
I don't think I want
to play a game.

14:13.606 --> 14:14.457
Oh, come on!

14:14.458 --> 14:15.722
They're playing one
across the hall--

14:15.747 --> 14:16.947
we should, too.

14:17.011 --> 14:19.478
Okay, we are gonna take
turns bouncing a quarter

14:19.480 --> 14:21.847
off the table, and if it
goes into this cup,

14:21.849 --> 14:23.265
the other person
has to drink.

14:23.267 --> 14:24.850
Then you get to
go again...

14:24.852 --> 14:27.035
(coin clinks in glass)

14:29.506 --> 14:31.023
Like that?

14:31.025 --> 14:33.192
Wow. Yeah, b-beginner's luck.

14:33.194 --> 14:37.112
So, now I will drink this entire
cup of beer, and you

14:37.114 --> 14:39.364
will go again...
(coin clinks in glass)

14:41.484 --> 14:42.734
Uh...

14:42.736 --> 14:44.870
All right. So, yeah, okay,
now I'm gonna

14:44.872 --> 14:48.173
drink this entire cup and then
I'm going to drink another one.

14:48.175 --> 14:51.660
(coin clinks in glass) Okay,
seriously, stop. What the hell?

14:51.662 --> 14:53.128
Spent a lot of my childhood

14:53.130 --> 14:55.413
throwing coins into wishing
wells hoping for friends.

14:55.415 --> 14:57.432
At a certain point, you
start doing trick shots

14:57.434 --> 14:59.751
just to keep
things interesting.

14:59.753 --> 15:02.938
Whoa, give me a second
to catch up here. Hold on.

15:02.940 --> 15:04.456
(guys cheering
across the hall)

15:04.458 --> 15:06.208
That'd be
my boyfriend

15:06.210 --> 15:07.559
happier playing

15:07.561 --> 15:09.278
his dopey Star Trek game
with his friends

15:09.280 --> 15:10.395
than hanging out with me.

15:10.397 --> 15:12.698
- Wars.
- What?

15:12.700 --> 15:13.782
Star Wars.

15:13.784 --> 15:15.951
They get all cranky
when you mix the two up.

15:15.953 --> 15:17.035
What's the difference?

15:17.037 --> 15:19.788
There's absolutely
no difference.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.576
How do I get him
to treat me better?

15:24.578 --> 15:25.744
All right.

15:25.746 --> 15:27.913
Let me give you
a little girlfriend 101.

15:27.915 --> 15:30.082
Usually the first move
out of the gate

15:30.084 --> 15:31.383
is you withhold sex,

15:31.385 --> 15:33.952
but that will work better
after Sheldon hits puberty.

15:33.954 --> 15:37.472
So, I'd say...

15:37.474 --> 15:39.424
give him the silent treatment.

15:39.426 --> 15:41.393
No, he loves that.
Hmm.

15:41.395 --> 15:43.428
Our record for sitting
in a room together

15:43.430 --> 15:46.481
and not speaking to each other
is six-and-a half hours.

15:46.483 --> 15:49.184
He said it was
a magical evening.

15:49.186 --> 15:51.136
All right, then we're
gonna have to go

15:51.138 --> 15:52.404
with an oldie but goodie;

15:52.406 --> 15:53.522
making a scene.

15:53.524 --> 15:55.824
I don't think I'd
be good at that.

15:55.826 --> 15:57.276
That's why you're
lucky to have me.

15:57.278 --> 15:59.194
Back in Omaha, there are
two different restaurants

15:59.196 --> 16:00.762
I'm not allowed into.
Both Chili's.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.285
Bernadette, remember,
your character's

16:06.287 --> 16:08.036
the healer in our group.

16:08.038 --> 16:10.756
You're in charge of healing
all of us, not just Howard.

16:10.758 --> 16:12.507
I can't help it.

16:12.509 --> 16:15.327
My Howie Wowie
has an owie.

16:16.262 --> 16:18.964
That is the most sickeningly
sweet thing

16:18.966 --> 16:20.799
I have ever experienced.

16:20.801 --> 16:26.338
And I am sipping Kool-Aid
through a Red Vine.

16:26.340 --> 16:29.274
Sheldon Cooper, I've got
a bone to pick with you,

16:29.276 --> 16:31.977
and I'm about to do it
in front of all your friends.

16:31.979 --> 16:35.847
Yeah, you pick that bone.
You pick that bone clean!

16:35.849 --> 16:37.032
I'm gonna publicly shame you,

16:37.034 --> 16:39.401
and then sit back as societal
pressure compels you

16:39.403 --> 16:40.619
to modify your behavior.

16:40.621 --> 16:43.188
Ooh, buuurn!

16:44.207 --> 16:45.991
And if you don't start
treating me better,

16:45.993 --> 16:47.042
I'm leaving you

16:47.044 --> 16:49.694
for a miniature horse breeder
named Armen.

16:50.496 --> 16:52.547
Armen who?

16:52.549 --> 16:54.216
Armen... damn it.

16:56.702 --> 16:59.638
Look, Sheldon, she wanted
to show you off to her family,

16:59.640 --> 17:01.423
and you stood her up, okay?

17:01.425 --> 17:04.209
Look at this adorable,
smushy face.

17:04.211 --> 17:07.212
Smush, smush, smush.

17:07.214 --> 17:08.713
You're hurting me.

17:08.714 --> 17:11.650
No, Sheldon hurt you.

17:11.652 --> 17:13.685
Before; now it's you.

17:13.686 --> 17:15.520
Oh.

17:15.521 --> 17:18.339
I think I understand.

17:18.342 --> 17:19.441
You're the one person

17:19.443 --> 17:21.993
who can say Sheldon Cooper
is your boyfriend,

17:21.996 --> 17:24.780
but that rings hollow
if you can't lord him

17:24.781 --> 17:26.698
over others in the flesh.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.251
I forget what
I bring

17:29.253 --> 17:31.119
to the party
and what I take away

17:31.121 --> 17:32.921
when I leave.

17:32.923 --> 17:37.759
Please accept these valuable
Cooper Coupons...

17:39.429 --> 17:41.847
...as restitution.

17:41.849 --> 17:43.215
Sheldon, she doesn't
want your stupid...

17:43.217 --> 17:45.017
Ooh, Science Center.
Redeeming.

17:45.019 --> 17:47.419
Let's go.

17:48.471 --> 17:50.355
Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler.

17:50.357 --> 17:52.224
Let me get my coat.

17:52.226 --> 17:53.792
(whip cracks)

17:53.794 --> 17:55.477
Oh, grow up, Leonard.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.479
But e-excuse me,

17:57.481 --> 17:59.597
I have something to say.

18:00.616 --> 18:03.535
None of you may realize it,
but I was very much

18:03.537 --> 18:05.320
looking forward to this weekend.

18:05.322 --> 18:06.405
It was gonna be like

18:06.407 --> 18:08.907
the old days-- the four of us
hanging out

18:08.909 --> 18:10.625
playing video games
before you guys

18:10.627 --> 18:12.294
all got girlfriends.

18:12.296 --> 18:14.212
Do you have any idea
what it's like

18:14.214 --> 18:16.631
to be the only one
without a girlfriend?

18:16.633 --> 18:18.166
Even if I get one someday,

18:18.168 --> 18:20.168
I'll still be the guy
who got a girl

18:20.170 --> 18:22.971
after Sheldon Cooper!

18:27.226 --> 18:30.462
And that's how
a girl makes a scene.

18:35.184 --> 18:36.184
I'm sorry, sweetie.

18:36.186 --> 18:37.819
You're right.
You deserve your weekend.

18:37.821 --> 18:39.020
Come on, Amy,
let's go.

18:39.022 --> 18:40.822
What about the
Science Center?

18:40.824 --> 18:43.992
I'll let you hold my hair
while I throw up.

18:44.694 --> 18:46.912
Rain check.

18:47.947 --> 18:49.197
I'm gonna go, too.

18:49.199 --> 18:50.949
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss <i>you.</i>

18:50.951 --> 18:52.868
- I'll miss you more.
- No, I'll...

18:52.870 --> 18:55.253
Just leave!

18:58.157 --> 19:00.158
(sighs)
Okay, now.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.043
This is the way
it's supposed to be.

19:02.045 --> 19:04.379
Men together,
fighting the forces of evil.

19:04.381 --> 19:06.515
LEONARD, SHELDON, WOLOWITZ:
Hear! Hear!

19:06.517 --> 19:08.600
(sighs)

19:08.602 --> 19:11.503
I can't believe
this is only 64 calories.

(pounding at door)

19:29.051 --> 19:30.744
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard Joel Wolowitz!

19:30.745 --> 19:32.778
I've been worried sick
for two days,

19:32.780 --> 19:35.314
and I know you turned
off your phone!

19:37.684 --> 19:39.668
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
You open up this door right now

19:39.670 --> 19:41.370
because I've had it
up to here!

19:41.372 --> 19:43.288
I have been to the morgue
and the hospital,

19:43.290 --> 19:44.723
and I spent the last
half hour

19:44.725 --> 19:48.393
walking up these
<i>ferkakta</i> stairs!

19:51.414 --> 19:53.649
That's my ride; got to go.

19:55.184 --> 19:57.069
(whip cracks)
