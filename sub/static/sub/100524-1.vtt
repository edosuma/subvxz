Please don't smash my hands.

11:39.583 --> 11:40.783
No, no,
I really like using them.

11:40.785 --> 11:43.952
No, relax, Miles. We didn't come
here to smash your hands.

11:43.954 --> 11:47.391
Why did you tell me to bring
a hand smashing-hammer then?

11:47.591 --> 11:50.427

17:52.522 --> 17:54.690
<i>on Nix Degraves
as the sole suspect.</i>

17:54.692 --> 17:58.293
<i>Degraves was found criminally
insane at age 13.</i>

17:58.295 --> 18:01.296
<i>She recently escaped from
a maximum-security facility</i>

18:01.298 --> 18:02.832
<i>and has since gained notoriety</i>

18:02.834 --> 18:04.700
<i>as one of the most successful
contestants</i>

18:04.702 --> 18:06.869
<i>of the underground
fight club, Skizm.</i>

18:06.871 --> 18:09.038
<i>She is heavily armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

18:09.040 --> 18:10.505
This is good.

19:13.637 --> 19:15.603
<i>Detective Garret,
please report</i>

19:15.605 --> 19:16.774
<i>to the Captain's office.</i>

19:23.647 --> 19:25.380
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:45.937 --> 19:47.004
Okay.

19:47.939 --> 19:48.940
Careful.

19:49.506 --> 19:50.741
Jesus Christ.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.814
Oh, thank God.

20:04.088 --> 20:05.821
Wow. Doesn't matter,

20:05.823 --> 20:07.091
just don't shoot yourself
in the dick.

20:24.876 --> 20:25.877
Okay.

21:08.986 --> 21:10.119
Woah! No! No!

21:12.256 --> 21:13.891
No!

21:14.258 --> 21:15.860
No! No, no, no!

21:18.996 --> 21:20.195
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

21:20.197 --> 21:21.697
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck!

21:21.699 --> 21:23.034
Damn it.

21:24.035 --> 21:25.736
Oh, God!

21:26.203 --> 21:27.204
Fuck!

21:33.678 --> 21:35.711
- Nice fap-cave.
- You shot me!

21:35.713 --> 21:38.546
You actually fucking shot me?

21:38.548 --> 21:39.815
Okay, please. I... I...

21:39.817 --> 21:41.951
I don't want anything to do
with Skizm.

21:41.953 --> 21:43.886
Okay, I'm... I'm...
I'm not a fighter.

21:43.888 --> 21:44.822
I'm a nobody.

21:46.090 --> 21:49.291
Yeah. Why are you dual wielding
pieces then, Mister Hard boiled?

21:49.293 --> 21:52.661
Oh, these? No, no, no.
These... See? They drugged me

21:52.663 --> 21:53.798
and they drilled these
onto my hands.

21:54.065 --> 21:55.965
Like right through my...
Shit.

21:55.967 --> 21:58.200
I... I think I need
some antiseptic or something.

21:58.202 --> 22:00.102
They're all... They're all red
and sore.

22:00.104 --> 22:03.205
- Oh, that's rough, fuck boy.
- So, how about you and me,

22:03.207 --> 22:04.907
we can just, like,
truce things out

22:04.909 --> 22:06.775
and you can stop
destroying my things.

22:06.777 --> 22:09.479
Or just, like, shoot around
the really rare stuff?

22:10.081 --> 22:11.716
Okay. Here's what we'll do.

22:11.983 --> 22:13.017
Take a few minutes.

22:13.684 --> 22:16.085
- Breathe. Relax.
- Okay.

22:16.087 --> 22:18.821
And then go take a shit
because there's nothing worse

22:18.823 --> 22:20.322
than shooting
a poop-filled corpse.

22:20.324 --> 22:21.890
It's like a hitting
a turd piñata.

22:21.892 --> 22:24.093
After, I'll just sit you down
nice and easy

22:24.095 --> 22:25.830
and shoot you
in the fucking brain stem.

22:31.969 --> 22:32.970
Fuck!

22:34.839 --> 22:37.006
Shit! What the fuck?

22:53.657 --> 22:54.658
Fuck!

23:05.102 --> 23:07.970
<i>And we're back,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

23:07.972 --> 23:10.739
<i>A brand-new match,
the new guy Miles Harris...</i>

23:10.741 --> 23:12.741
Who is that, Lily?
Never heard of him.

23:12.743 --> 23:15.146
<i>This Miles Harris
kid is a joke.</i>

23:25.622 --> 23:27.923
<i>Man, I can't even
remember the last time</i>

23:27.925 --> 23:30.125
<i>I walked outside
without my face in my phone.</i>

23:30.127 --> 23:32.263
<i>Everything looks so HD.</i>

23:35.699 --> 23:37.166
Oh, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

23:37.168 --> 23:39.136
Hey, I need help!
Someone's trying to kill me!

23:39.336 --> 23:42.237
- Hey, drop your guns.
- Oh, right. Shit.

23:42.239 --> 23:44.639
- Drop 'em now!
- No, no, no. Please.

23:52.249 --> 23:54.318
No!

23:56.120 --> 23:58.756
- <i>Will they take out Miles?</i>
- <i>What the fuck is he doing?</i>

24:01.025 --> 24:02.691
<i>We can all say,</i>

24:02.693 --> 24:03.926
<i>give Miles Harris
a salute, I think.</i>

24:03.928 --> 24:06.428
<i>Mom used to say,
always wear clean underwear</i>

24:06.430 --> 24:07.965
<i>in case you get in an accident.</i>

24:09.266 --> 24:11.368
<i>I'm going to add her to
the list of people I let down.</i>

24:12.670 --> 24:14.371
- You think he's a crack head?
- Definitely.

24:18.641 --> 24:20.878
- Hey!
- Dispatch. We have a 918.

24:21.078 --> 24:22.146
Suspect is armed and dangerous.

24:23.447 --> 24:24.513
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,
I can't believe it,</i>

24:24.515 --> 24:25.581
<i>but we actually have a show
for you today,</i>

24:25.583 --> 24:28.016
<i>Miles is running
from the fucking cops!</i>

24:28.018 --> 24:29.918
Look at him.
Running like a bitch.

24:31.856 --> 24:32.857
Freeze!

24:38.696 --> 24:40.898
- I'm gonna shoot!
- Please don't!

24:47.805 --> 24:50.207
<i>Freeze! Stop now!</i>

25:02.753 --> 25:03.754
Oh, no.

25:05.723 --> 25:06.724
Idiot.

25:14.865 --> 25:17.132
Oh, no. Oh, shit.

25:17.134 --> 25:19.136
No, sir.
Oh, God.

25:24.475 --> 25:26.343
Are you... Are you okay?

25:26.744 --> 25:28.877
Oh, God no you're not.

25:28.879 --> 25:30.412
- Whoa, fuck. Fuck.
- No, no, no, no.

25:30.414 --> 25:32.014
These... These...
These are just my hands.

25:32.016 --> 25:33.749
You're fine. You're fine.
I'm not going to do

25:33.751 --> 25:35.083
anything else to you.
I'm sorry.

25:35.085 --> 25:37.252
Just try...
Just lie and hold that, okay?

25:37.254 --> 25:39.421
Okay. I'm sure they're coming
for you right now.

25:39.423 --> 25:42.257
Oh, yeah they are.
Okay, I have to go now.

25:42.259 --> 25:43.694
- Bye. Bye-bye.
- Shit.

26:08.118 --> 26:09.320
Sorry, sorry.

26:13.090 --> 26:15.791
Nova. Oh, no.

26:15.793 --> 26:17.159
Oh, no, no, no.

26:17.161 --> 26:19.330
Nova, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

26:31.275 --> 26:32.209
No.

26:34.211 --> 26:36.280
Nova. Nova.

26:36.814 --> 26:38.048
Holy shit.

26:38.482 --> 26:40.217
- Hey.
- Miles?

26:40.851 --> 26:42.353
Oh. Oh, God.

26:44.989 --> 26:47.925
I'm sorry I'm late.
Alarms and stuff.

26:49.593 --> 26:50.794
Shit.

26:51.528 --> 26:54.329
- Go. Drive now.
- Relax. Relax.

26:54.331 --> 26:57.099
- You have to drive.
- I'm not driving anywhere

26:57.101 --> 26:58.836
until you chill.

27:00.838 --> 27:03.807
Okay, cool. I'm cool.

27:18.589 --> 27:20.391
Go to 7th and Shadwell,
give me Miles.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.001
So...

27:32.069 --> 27:34.970
Unsure how to broach this,
I can't help but notice

27:34.972 --> 27:36.874
you aren't wearing pants.

27:37.074 --> 27:38.607
Oh, yes. Yeah.

27:38.609 --> 27:42.878
No there was a fire alarm
at my apartment.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.080
I got locked out of my building.
Mondays, right?

27:45.082 --> 27:48.150
I feel ya!
It's actually Thursday, though.

27:48.152 --> 27:50.552
Do you still have
one of my spare inhalers?

27:50.554 --> 27:53.355
Uh, maybe. Check my handbag.
Down there.

27:53.357 --> 27:55.457
Uh, could you just
grab it for me?

27:55.459 --> 27:57.961
I was up all night, last night
coding. I have terrible RSI.

27:58.495 --> 28:01.163
Right. Some vigorous coding.

28:01.165 --> 28:02.166
Yeah.

28:09.340 --> 28:11.975
- Here.
- Oh, I'm sorry, could you do it?

28:12.309 --> 28:13.477
- Right.
- Thanks.

28:18.048 --> 28:19.682
Oh, shit, thank you.

28:19.684 --> 28:21.051
- Okay?
- Yeah.

28:22.119 --> 28:24.288
- Why don't you hold onto that.
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

28:28.592 --> 28:30.660
- It's really good to see you.
- This was a mistake.

28:30.662 --> 28:34.298
- Oh. Okay.
- I shouldn't have messaged you.

28:35.132 --> 28:37.667
- I'll drop you home.
- No. No. Please don't.

28:37.669 --> 28:40.202
I can't go back there right now,
it's very crazy for me.

28:40.204 --> 28:42.003
How about we just hang
at your place?

28:42.005 --> 28:44.208
No. Miles,
You just need to move on.

28:44.541 --> 28:45.607
- Oh.
- I mean,

28:45.609 --> 28:49.044
why don't you just meet
someone new, I don't know.

28:50.047 --> 28:51.081
Okay, I mean...

28:52.149 --> 28:54.249
Here's the thing.
I kind of did meet somebody new.

28:54.251 --> 28:56.686
- Oh? Do... Do I know her?
- Uh...

28:56.688 --> 28:58.086
- What's her name?
- Her name is Nix

28:58.088 --> 28:59.488
and she's actually trying
to kill me.

28:59.490 --> 29:02.057
So, these guys from Skizm
came to my house last night,

29:02.059 --> 29:03.525
they're making me fight her.

29:03.527 --> 29:05.193
- Skizm?
- Mm-hmm.

29:05.195 --> 29:07.195
- Miles, you joined Skizm?
- Yes...

29:07.197 --> 29:09.398
- No. No. No way.
- What is wrong with you?

29:09.400 --> 29:10.465
I did not join.

29:10.467 --> 29:11.635
Are you out of your
freaking mind?

29:12.871 --> 29:13.669
No, no, no. I did not join.
They're forcing... Okay, um...

29:13.671 --> 29:16.371
Can I...
Can I show you something?

29:16.373 --> 29:19.042
But you have to promise me
to be cool with it.

29:19.744 --> 29:20.978
Sure.

29:21.979 --> 29:23.445
Okay, just be prepared,
all right? Don't freak.

29:23.447 --> 29:25.048
Do I look like I'm freaking?

29:25.349 --> 29:27.985
Okay, this is fair warning.
Okay.

29:32.256 --> 29:33.691
What the fuck, Miles?

29:34.124 --> 29:35.658
Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:35.660 --> 29:38.059
- Fuck!
- What's wrong with you?

29:38.061 --> 29:40.297
I said don't freak out!
God!

29:41.231 --> 29:42.665
Put me through
to the police.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.001
Nova!

29:45.169 --> 29:47.504
Nova!

29:59.283 --> 30:01.483
<i>I've never seen
anything like this</i>

30:01.485 --> 30:02.553
<i>in the history of Skizm.</i>

30:03.855 --> 30:06.054
<i>Look, Miles Harris just jumped
into a fucking clothes bin!</i>

30:06.056 --> 30:07.991
<i>This guy is absolute trash.</i>

30:11.228 --> 30:14.162
<i>I really like this,
this is fucking unbelievable.</i>

30:14.164 --> 30:15.698
<i>Keep those comments coming
in everybody,</i>

30:15.700 --> 30:17.568
<i>let us know what you
think's gonna happen next.</i>

30:23.808 --> 30:26.041
That's enough,
cut to camera four.

30:26.043 --> 30:28.510
- Cutting to four.
- Stay on Miles.

30:28.512 --> 30:30.746
It's an inanimate fucking
clothing bin.

30:30.748 --> 30:32.214
Hardly must-see TV.

30:32.216 --> 30:34.485
Can you just let me do my job?

30:35.319 --> 30:36.654
I'm directing here.

30:40.057 --> 30:42.725
- Do what he says.
- How do you even breathe

30:42.727 --> 30:44.827
with that stupid gimp mask on?

30:44.829 --> 30:47.062
Whoa, don't make ol' Fuckface
take his mask off,

30:47.064 --> 30:49.231
you might not sleep so well
afterwards.

30:49.233 --> 30:52.634
Look, just let me do my thing.
Okay?

30:52.636 --> 30:54.037
You do yours.

30:54.271 --> 30:57.606
Stand around looking like
end-level bosses

30:57.608 --> 30:58.808
from <i>Streets of Rage.</i>

31:01.378 --> 31:04.747
You couldn't direct my cock
into a top hat,

31:04.749 --> 31:06.448
you talentless piece of shit.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.619
Having trouble
breathing?

31:09.219 --> 31:11.386
This is good, get a camera.

31:11.388 --> 31:13.221
Get this on camera.
This is good.

31:13.223 --> 31:14.790
Hurry up and get
a fucking camera!

31:14.792 --> 31:17.327
Is this on panorama?
How do we get it back to video?

31:17.528 --> 31:18.629
Swipe at the bottom.

31:19.731 --> 31:21.496
- Oh, shit the app just crashed.
- Hurry the fuck up.

31:21.498 --> 31:23.365
- Jesus, Dane!
- This is great!

31:29.774 --> 31:31.341
Go to seven.

31:32.677 --> 31:35.778
Well, either he'll run and die,

31:35.780 --> 31:37.414
he'll fight and die,

31:38.115 --> 31:40.215
or he'll puss out and die.

31:40.217 --> 31:43.755
Just as long as the viewers
enjoy the show.

31:45.589 --> 31:46.590
Oh, Miles.

31:48.492 --> 31:50.793
We know you're in there.

32:20.257 --> 32:21.258
Fuck.

32:22.894 --> 32:25.162
Fuck! Fuck this!

32:25.429 --> 32:26.831
Fuck everything.

32:33.570 --> 32:35.707
I wouldn't do
that if I was you.

32:38.743 --> 32:41.311
- Why shouldn't I?
- Huh?

32:43.781 --> 32:46.617
- Why shouldn't I?
- Well, the angle's all wrong.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.283
You won't hit your brain.

32:48.285 --> 32:50.454
You'll just end up blowing
your damn face off.

32:51.221 --> 32:53.557
Oh. Okay, thanks.

32:53.825 --> 32:55.392
And then you'll still
be depressed.

32:56.661 --> 32:57.729
Even more depressed probably,
because of your fucked-up face.

32:58.528 --> 33:01.598
Try and angle it right
to the rear, base of the head.

33:01.966 --> 33:03.166
Okay.

33:04.102 --> 33:06.336
Okay, you know way too much
about this.

33:06.838 --> 33:08.205
Just trying to be helpful, man.

33:09.339 --> 33:11.539
Hey, look this is going to sound
really fucking weird,

33:11.541 --> 33:13.608
but could you help dress me?

33:13.610 --> 33:15.479
I have guns bolted to my hands.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.147
This whole deal.

33:18.950 --> 33:21.618
Yeah, you're right. That does
sound pretty fucking weird.

33:32.664 --> 33:34.164
Oh, sorry.

33:38.502 --> 33:40.705
Turn it off. I've seen enough.

33:40.905 --> 33:42.838
Seems like
your boyfriend's got himself

33:42.840 --> 33:43.908
into some pretty deep shit.

33:45.043 --> 33:48.245
None of this makes sense.
I mean, this isn't Miles.

33:51.248 --> 33:53.248
That's all Nova,
you're free to go.

33:53.250 --> 33:54.784
- That's it?
- Well, obviously

33:54.786 --> 33:57.753
if he calls you, you get in
touch with us right away, okay?

33:57.755 --> 34:01.926
Look, Miles has issues
but he's a good guy.

34:03.460 --> 34:04.862
Just bring him in alive, okay?

34:05.262 --> 34:06.530
Well, we'll do our best.

34:16.540 --> 34:19.675
Hack her phone.
Have her followed 24/7.

34:19.677 --> 34:20.476
Oh, come on.

34:21.445 --> 34:23.246
You really think
he's gonna make contact?

34:24.815 --> 34:26.884
Nix is after this guy,
we need to get to him first.

34:46.303 --> 34:48.303
You want a double bow
on that buddy or?

34:48.304 --> 34:49.806
Uh, that should be fine,
thanks.

34:50.742 --> 34:53.541
Fuck, brother, it sounds like
you're in some deep shit.

34:53.543 --> 34:55.878
Yeah, I just...
I... I can't face violence.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.849
You know, not...
not in real life.

34:58.683 --> 35:00.584
Hey, you don't have anything
to eat, do you?

35:00.785 --> 35:02.486
Well, let's have a look
at the pantry.

35:03.453 --> 35:06.621
Oh, here we go.
Half a cold hotdog.

35:06.623 --> 35:10.993
Um, you don't have a vegetarian
option, do you?

35:10.995 --> 35:13.696
So, you don't believe
in violence

35:13.698 --> 35:17.066
- or eating meat.
- I don't like, uh,

35:17.068 --> 35:19.869
contributing to the suffering
in the world, I guess.

35:19.871 --> 35:21.704
Well, that's a great
philosophy man.

35:21.706 --> 35:22.938
But most people in the world,

35:22.940 --> 35:24.907
they just eat whatever
they can get.

35:24.909 --> 35:27.011
And it's one thing to say
you can't face violence.

35:27.444 --> 35:29.981
But when it faces you,
you better be ready.

35:31.448 --> 35:34.349
- You a Citrus Hill fan?
- Who?

35:34.351 --> 35:37.019
<i>♪ When the shit goes down
You better be ready ♪</i>

35:37.021 --> 35:38.520
<i>♪ You better be ready ♪</i>

35:38.522 --> 35:40.024
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

35:40.725 --> 35:44.461
Okay, fuck it. Can you just
push it into my mouth?

35:46.363 --> 35:48.731
Seriously?
I just fucking dressed you,

35:48.733 --> 35:50.398
now you want me to feed you?

35:50.400 --> 35:52.435
What's next, you want me
to wipe your arse?

35:52.770 --> 35:55.137
- That could be really useful...
- Don't even talk about it.

35:55.139 --> 35:56.339
Okay.

36:05.615 --> 36:08.052
- Ah! Fuck!
- Ah! So close.

36:11.689 --> 36:14.657
That's still you know,
10 second rule.

36:14.659 --> 36:16.093
Yup. Okay.

36:18.930 --> 36:20.865
That's it, yeah.

36:21.165 --> 36:23.567
Yeah, channel your animal side.

36:24.534 --> 36:25.468
You're gonna need it.

36:26.403 --> 36:27.772
Cause it's a dog eat
dog world out here.

36:28.172 --> 36:30.708
What kind of meat did they make
that from?

36:31.075 --> 36:33.441
I don't know but it's been
in here for 8 months.

36:33.443 --> 36:35.579
Good to finally get rid of it.

36:37.915 --> 36:39.480
Hey, you don't happen
to know anything

36:39.482 --> 36:40.850
about GPS tracking, do you?

36:40.852 --> 36:42.051
Pretty sure I'm being bugged.

36:42.053 --> 36:43.620
Oh, I see how it is.

36:44.121 --> 36:46.689
You assume because I'm homeless,
I don't know nothing

36:46.691 --> 36:49.624
about dumb stupid GPS tracking
bullshit.

36:49.626 --> 36:51.559
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

36:51.561 --> 36:53.896
For all you know, I could be
a savant programmer

36:53.898 --> 36:56.531
who got screwed after my startup
went bust.

36:56.533 --> 36:58.435
I'm so sorry. Are you?

36:58.669 --> 37:00.403
What? No!

37:00.705 --> 37:03.205
I spend all of my time getting
fucked up on a bunch of crack.

37:03.207 --> 37:06.543
- Oh. Good for you.
- Wanna smoke some crack?

37:06.744 --> 37:08.509
- Ahh...
- Yes.

37:08.511 --> 37:11.082
I'm good. The...
The hotdog was... was enough.

37:38.743 --> 37:40.745
Hey. Watch it, asshole.

37:42.545 --> 37:44.882
Shit. Fuck it's you.

37:45.482 --> 37:47.752
Hey, why don't you stop running,
Edward Gun-hands?

38:03.200 --> 38:04.735
Psst. Hey.

38:05.169 --> 38:07.903
Fuck, dude. What the hell?

38:07.905 --> 38:09.772
Where've you been all day?
Zander is pissed.

38:09.774 --> 38:12.007
I'm in some trouble, man.
I think I'm being tracked.

38:12.009 --> 38:13.275
- By?
- Don't worry about that.

38:13.277 --> 38:16.145
Just... If you were gonna stalk
someone, how would you do it?

38:16.147 --> 38:17.780
Okay, who told you
I was stalking them?

38:17.782 --> 38:19.183
Was it Laura?
Because she's a liar.

38:19.582 --> 38:22.153
No, no, no. No. Dude, focus.
How would you track me?

38:23.054 --> 38:25.921
Easiest way, malware on your
cell, you could do it remotely.

38:25.923 --> 38:27.890
- You have it on you?
- Ah, yeah.

38:27.892 --> 38:30.993
Yeah, I do, I just... Um, yeah,
it's in my front jeans pocket.

38:30.995 --> 38:33.062
- Can you just grab it?
- No. Fuck, no.

38:33.064 --> 38:34.229
- Just pass the phone dude.
- I can't.

38:34.231 --> 38:36.533
I just... There was a...
I...

38:37.201 --> 38:40.537
glued my hands
inside my jacket.

38:41.638 --> 38:43.105
You did both of your hands.

38:43.107 --> 38:44.840
- Mm-hmm.
- How is that possible?

38:44.842 --> 38:47.542
No, I know. It was...
It was really complicated.

38:47.544 --> 38:49.278
There were holes in the inside
of my pockets,

38:49.280 --> 38:51.914
so I just glued them together
and then I put the jacket on

38:51.916 --> 38:53.816
and I forgot and I got drunk
and I fell asleep

38:53.818 --> 38:56.153
with my hands in my pockets.
And now, here we are.

38:56.754 --> 38:58.120
- Just...
- No, no, no. I'm not... no.

38:58.122 --> 39:00.089
- I don't want to.
- Stop being a dick about it,

39:00.091 --> 39:01.790
just stick your fingers
in there. Come on.

39:01.792 --> 39:02.927
Jesus Christ!

39:04.095 --> 39:05.830
Oh, God, it's deep in there.

39:06.230 --> 39:07.965
It's so tight. Oh, man.

39:08.165 --> 39:10.868
Oh, it's still warm
from your thigh.

39:15.106 --> 39:16.772
<i>Beginning.</i>

39:16.774 --> 39:18.240
Okay, okay, so?

39:18.242 --> 39:20.142
This is not Hackers dude, okay?

39:20.144 --> 39:24.046
This search will take a while.
Hours, you know, maybe...

39:24.048 --> 39:26.583
- <i>Malware found.</i>
- Oh, it's done.

39:26.951 --> 39:29.186
- This is some advanced shit.
- Okay, can you delete it?

39:29.586 --> 39:31.720
Of course I can. Unless you want
to able to reactivate it later?

39:31.722 --> 39:33.822
We could set up a quick app
so you could flick it on.

39:33.824 --> 39:35.292
No. No. Just get rid of it.
Um...

39:36.060 --> 39:38.195
Okay, yeah, no, that could be
handy, do that one.

39:40.831 --> 39:41.866
Hey, Miles.

39:42.266 --> 39:43.734
- Zander.
- So, it's 4:00 p.m.

39:44.001 --> 39:46.636
And you come in looking like
complete shit.

39:46.937 --> 39:48.005
You on drugs?

39:49.206 --> 39:50.875
You speed-balling the NDNA
straight into your eyeballs?

39:51.108 --> 39:53.310
- I've been sick. Okay?
- Sick?

39:53.944 --> 39:55.010
You okay little man?

39:55.012 --> 39:57.281
Why don't you take the rest
of the day off, huh?

39:57.681 --> 40:00.684
Or you could just fuck
the fuck off forever.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.660
Cops are looking for you.

40:10.627 --> 40:12.263
Seems like you're in some
deep shit now.

40:12.696 --> 40:14.163
I always knew you were
a fuck-up.

40:14.165 --> 40:16.932
- Let me go.
- What you gonna do? Take me on?

40:16.934 --> 40:19.201
You gonna hit me, <i>amigo?</i>
You <i>El Loco?</i>

- Okay, I'm sorry,

40:25.743 --> 40:27.242
- please don't kill me.
- You put me down

40:27.244 --> 40:28.844
every time
I come in that door,

40:28.846 --> 40:31.980
you docked my pay for attending
my mother's funeral,

40:31.982 --> 40:34.049
and you hit on my girlfriend
in front me!

40:34.051 --> 40:37.753

Fuck off.
Please. Just leave me alone.

46:00.511 --> 46:02.310

- is looking to end me, so...
- Yeah, that's not my fault!

46:07.050 --> 46:09.117
Skizm said they would wipe
my slate clean

46:09.119 --> 46:11.553
- after I bury your ass.
- Oh, that's what they told you?

46:11.555 --> 46:13.288
What, so you're just like
their minion?

46:13.290 --> 46:17.225

<i>running around with guns,

to my hands,

48:05.703 --> 48:07.235

to tell you.

48:07.237 --> 48:08.871
<i>"Bolted"?
What do you mean "bolted"?</i>

48:08.873 --> 48:10.773

with some Home Depot supplies.

48:11.943 --> 48:14.244
<i>Oh, fuck, you were trying
to tell me in the car.</i>

48:14.578 --> 48:16.113
Yeah. Yeah I did.

<i>Okay, just...
Just turn yourself in.</i>

48:20.584 --> 48:22.584
- <i>They'll protect you.</i>
- I can't.

48:22.586 --> 48:24.419
I'm actually...
I'm just leaving town.

48:24.421 --> 48:25.721
I just called to say, goodbye

48:25.723 --> 48:29.259
- and, uh... thanks.
- <i>Thanks?</i>

48:29.661 --> 48:34.498
For being with me, for making me
a much better person.

48:34.799 --> 48:36.133
<i>Don't say that.</i>

48:36.567 --> 48:38.268
<i>You were always that person.</i>

48:38.803 --> 48:41.202
<i>I don't know what trouble
you're in</i>

48:41.204 --> 48:43.538
<i>but you can't keep running
from...</i>

48:43.540 --> 48:46.076
Nova! Hello?

48:47.812 --> 48:49.146
<i>Oh, hello.</i>

48:50.447 --> 48:51.446
<i>I'm sorry but Nova can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

48:51.448 --> 48:54.149
Oh, fucking you again.
Leave Nova out of this.

48:54.151 --> 48:55.918
<i>Shut your fucking whine hole
and fight.</i>

48:55.920 --> 48:58.386
<i>You need to get your head out
of your ass, Miles,</i>

48:58.388 --> 48:59.454
<i>and grow a set of balls.</i>

48:59.456 --> 49:02.357
<i>Now, you got five hours
to kill Nix.</i>

49:02.359 --> 49:04.694
<i>Otherwise we're gonna
let Dane here</i>

49:04.696 --> 49:07.297
<i>start cutting pieces off
your bitch.</i>

49:07.899 --> 49:09.832
<i>Hey! Oh, ho, ho!</i>

49:09.834 --> 49:11.433

53:59.991 --> 54:01.623
Skizm do that?

54:01.625 --> 54:04.159
Yes, Skizm did that,
you think I did this to myself?

54:04.161 --> 54:07.229
I guess drilling the second one
in would be a little difficult.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.498
How do we proceed?

54:10.500 --> 54:12.034
Oh, you know what,
I got an idea about that.

54:12.036 --> 54:14.005
How about we take these
fucking things off my hands!

54:15.006 --> 54:17.106
Look, they have my girlfriend,
okay?

54:17.108 --> 54:18.741
My ex... ex-girlfriend.

54:18.743 --> 54:21.846
Whatever.
Just let me help you, please.

54:23.047 --> 54:24.514
Okay, thank you.

54:25.615 --> 54:29.617
Oh, uh, detective,
you missed the turn off.

54:29.619 --> 54:31.754
We ain't headed
to the hospital anymore.

54:31.756 --> 54:32.823
What? Why not?

54:34.158 --> 54:35.927
Nix is after you, right?

54:36.593 --> 54:37.895
We're after Nix.

54:38.495 --> 54:40.029
Change of plan, sweetheart.

54:40.031 --> 54:42.031
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
So I'm just bait now?

54:42.033 --> 54:44.632
That seems very not legal
for police officers.

54:44.634 --> 54:47.169
Miles I want to tell you
a story about my wife.

54:47.171 --> 54:49.004
Ah, I don't give a shit
about your wife.

54:49.006 --> 54:51.539
Sorry, dude, can we get these
fucking things off my hands?

54:51.541 --> 54:53.742
Sixteen years ago,
I'm chasing this gang.

54:53.744 --> 54:55.880
Right? I bust 'em.

54:56.247 --> 54:59.580
Their leader was this
psychopathic little dirt bag

54:59.582 --> 55:00.783
covered in tattoos.

55:00.785 --> 55:02.687
Went by the name of Riktor.

55:03.154 --> 55:05.921
Now I gots the bad guys,
that's my job, I'm a cop.

55:05.923 --> 55:06.891
But Riktor...

55:08.659 --> 55:10.593
he takes it very personally.

55:11.195 --> 55:15.532
He makes bail,
they track my wife and kids...

55:23.941 --> 55:26.075
Yeah, that's it.

55:26.077 --> 55:27.544
Burn, baby, burn.

55:31.215 --> 55:33.483
I managed to get
my daughter out.

55:35.953 --> 55:37.722
My wife and son were gone.

55:38.956 --> 55:40.925
Nix was gone too
in a different way.

55:42.727 --> 55:44.862
Wait, Nix is your daughter?

55:45.329 --> 55:47.530
Tried to get her the help
she needed.

55:48.099 --> 55:50.201
But it was never enough.

55:51.335 --> 55:54.739
She's my flesh and blood,
I have to stop her.

55:57.208 --> 56:00.109
<i>Uh-oh, looks like
Miles has been taken away</i>

56:00.111 --> 56:01.112
<i>by the pigs.</i>

56:02.313 --> 56:03.848
<i>I mean, seriously, generally
such a disappointment.</i>

56:04.614 --> 56:05.850
Hey!

56:06.350 --> 56:08.851
You look like a fighter.
Hmm?

56:08.853 --> 56:10.688
Maybe you could be
our next player.

56:11.922 --> 56:14.624
The cops are watching my house,
idiot.

56:15.192 --> 56:17.259
They would have followed you,
they probably have the place

56:17.261 --> 56:18.295
surrounded already!

56:19.363 --> 56:20.863
- The cops?
- Yeah.

56:20.865 --> 56:21.966
Surrounded?

56:23.200 --> 56:26.270
Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna do
a poo-poo in my pantaloons!

56:26.804 --> 56:28.237
The actual cops?

56:28.239 --> 56:30.508
Oh, my God! The cops!

56:32.009 --> 56:36.013
Who the fuck do you think
owns the fucking cops?

56:36.814 --> 56:39.048
- What?
- Dane, kill the drones.

56:39.050 --> 56:40.115
Yes, boss!

56:40.117 --> 56:41.252
We need to keep our cover.

56:44.321 --> 56:46.121
<i>Hang on,
I think we just lost the stream</i>

56:46.123 --> 56:47.756
- <i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>
- <i>Yeah,</i>

56:47.758 --> 56:49.693
<i>we're gonna get this back.
We're gonna get this back.</i>

56:52.163 --> 56:54.096
Hey, Stanton,
where the fuck are we?

56:54.098 --> 56:55.731
Fuck!

56:55.733 --> 56:57.099
Fuck!
Holy shit, dude!

56:57.101 --> 56:58.903
What the actual fuck?

57:00.671 --> 57:02.605
Is that look supposed
to fucking explain something?

57:07.011 --> 57:10.045
People keep fucking dying on me!

57:10.047 --> 57:11.947
What the...
Okay, fuck.

57:11.949 --> 57:13.749
Yes!
Okay.

57:13.751 --> 57:17.319
Stop your whining,
you millennial piece of shit!

57:17.321 --> 57:19.023
What the fuck are you doing?

57:21.025 --> 57:22.658
<i>Hey there, big guy!</i>

57:22.660 --> 57:25.727
<i>Rule number 1.
Do not, I repeat do not,</i>

57:25.729 --> 57:29.198
<i>under any circumstances
talk to the fucking pigs!</i>

57:29.200 --> 57:30.201
<i>You got that?</i>

57:31.469 --> 57:33.202
<i>Now we should get Stanton there
to give you an extreme makeover</i>

57:33.204 --> 57:34.403
<i>with the butt of his Glock!</i>

57:34.405 --> 57:36.905
<i>But I see something
in you, Miles, you know?</i>

57:36.907 --> 57:38.175
<i>Potential.</i>

57:38.409 --> 57:40.344
<i>So I've decided to give you...</i>

57:40.845 --> 57:42.179
<i>another chance.</i>

57:42.847 --> 57:44.146
Fuck you!
Where's Nova?

57:44.148 --> 57:46.415
- It's pre-recorded asshole!
- Oh!

57:48.686 --> 57:50.986
<i>Welcome to the
lightening round!</i>

57:50.988 --> 57:53.856
<i>Somewhere in this city,
we've got your bitch!</i>

57:53.858 --> 57:57.226
<i>You've got 30 minutes,
that is 30 minutes to kill Nix.</i>

57:57.228 --> 58:01.230
<i>Or we take Nova apart
piece by fucking piece!</i>

58:01.232 --> 58:02.331
No!

58:02.333 --> 58:04.233
<i>Put a filter on that,
make me look good.</i>

58:04.235 --> 58:06.235
<i>It might have been a bit
over the top.</i>

58:07.872 --> 58:08.939
Fuck!

anything like it!

59:59.550 --> 01:00:01.785

- Yeah, sure.

01:00:17.334 --> 01:00:18.335

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.476
No!

01:00:29.847 --> 01:00:32.981

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:50.394
Neat location, by the way.

01:01:51.161 --> 01:01:53.328
What, you couldn't find
a classic rooftop

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.964
for your final showdown,
fuckboy?

01:01:55.966 --> 01:01:57.599
God!
Stop calling me fuckboy, okay?

01:01:57.601 --> 01:01:59.067
I don't even know
what that means!

01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.970
Whoa...

01:02:01.038 --> 01:02:02.206
I thought we were going
to talk it out for a bit?

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.475
Exchange some banter.

01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:08.510
Some obligatory
pre-gunfight foreplay.

01:02:08.512 --> 01:02:10.479
You want to get straight
to the shooting?

01:02:10.481 --> 01:02:13.281
No. No, look I need your help.

01:02:13.283 --> 01:02:14.518
My help?

01:02:14.985 --> 01:02:16.954
Skizm is going to kill us both!

01:02:17.454 --> 01:02:19.623
Together we might have a chance.

01:02:20.124 --> 01:02:22.692
You know, let's...
Let's team up.

01:02:22.694 --> 01:02:24.626
I got a much better chance
if I'm with you.

01:02:24.628 --> 01:02:26.997
I know that.
So, you in?

01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:29.166
Um...

01:02:31.402 --> 01:02:32.903
well, no.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.040
Yes! Yes!

01:02:39.042 --> 01:02:40.976
Yabba-dabba-do!

01:02:40.978 --> 01:02:42.644
Fuck yeah!

01:02:42.646 --> 01:02:44.747
Guns Akimbo dude was here.

01:02:44.749 --> 01:02:46.214
I met him!

01:02:50.254 --> 01:02:52.322
Oh!

01:02:53.056 --> 01:02:54.122
No!

01:02:54.124 --> 01:02:55.691
This is so unfair!

01:02:55.693 --> 01:02:58.295
It's just a game, bro.
It's just a game.

01:02:58.996 --> 01:03:00.663
Yes! Serves you right, asshole!

01:03:00.665 --> 01:03:03.133
<i>And that is Miles
out of the game.</i>

01:03:07.571 --> 01:03:09.540
Well that took longer
than I thought.

01:03:11.743 --> 01:03:14.044
Let's go get some cocaine!

01:03:14.511 --> 01:03:16.011
<i>Miles Harris...</i>

01:03:16.013 --> 01:03:17.612
- <i>I'm not happy!</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

01:03:17.614 --> 01:03:18.714
<i>That's some bullshit,</i>

01:03:18.716 --> 01:03:20.683
<i>I'm sorry but that's
fucking bullshit!</i>

01:03:20.685 --> 01:03:22.584
<i>No, that's the game
of Skizm, man!</i>

01:03:22.586 --> 01:03:24.486
<i>No, no. I really started
to like the fucking guy!</i>

01:03:24.488 --> 01:03:26.254
<i>Fuck the game! God damn it!</i>

01:03:26.256 --> 01:03:28.256
<i>That's Skizm for you. Miles...</i>

01:03:28.258 --> 01:03:30.294
Get a cleanup squad
on Miles's body.

01:03:30.662 --> 01:03:32.329
Get a squad on Nix too!

01:03:32.697 --> 01:03:34.331
Ice that fucking bitch!

01:03:37.234 --> 01:03:38.335
Oh!

01:03:40.103 --> 01:03:41.436
I know!

01:03:46.243 --> 01:03:47.745
He did his best.

01:03:48.412 --> 01:03:49.681
But you know...

01:03:50.414 --> 01:03:53.181
sometimes, even when
you do your best,

01:03:53.183 --> 01:03:55.687
it's just not good enough.

01:03:58.555 --> 01:04:02.792
Just pitching here, but, uh,
chainsaws or nail guns?

01:04:02.794 --> 01:04:04.428
Which way were you leaning, huh?

01:04:45.636 --> 01:04:48.270
- Any plans tonight?
- Finally gonna catch up

01:04:48.272 --> 01:04:50.107
- on <i>The Walking Dead.</i>
- <i>The Walking Dead?</i>

01:04:50.507 --> 01:04:52.541
Can't stand that.
Just too violent.

01:04:52.543 --> 01:04:54.710
Man,
you kill people for a living.

01:04:54.712 --> 01:04:56.578
So what? You think
a cook goes home

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.646
and watches <i>Master Chef?</i>

01:05:38.923 --> 01:05:41.824
If you want to walk out
of here, with all of your limbs,

01:05:41.826 --> 01:05:44.561
you should stop pointing
guns at me!

01:05:45.295 --> 01:05:46.764
This was your idea, fuck boy!

01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:50.666
- Nice! Gotta love that Kevlar!
- Not nice!

01:05:50.668 --> 01:05:52.269
That hurts like shit!

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:55.639
You only had to shoot me once!
Remember?

01:06:09.586 --> 01:06:11.823
Don't shoot me,
I know who killed your family.

01:06:14.191 --> 01:06:15.626
What the fuck did you just say?

01:06:15.827 --> 01:06:18.495
He's the head of Skizm.
Okay, his name is Riktor.

01:06:19.897 --> 01:06:23.200
Bald guy, covered in tattoos.
That was him, right?

01:06:24.736 --> 01:06:28.203
Okay so my... my theory is he saw
you escape from prison

01:06:28.205 --> 01:06:29.471
and decided to put you
in the game

01:06:29.473 --> 01:06:30.842
in case you tried to get
revenge.

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:34.344
You're full of shit!

01:06:35.913 --> 01:06:37.481
They killed your dad, too.

01:06:37.782 --> 01:06:39.216
He's right there.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.481
You stubborn old bastard.

01:07:15.585 --> 01:07:18.020
So, um, hi...

01:07:18.022 --> 01:07:19.822
Sorry, don't know why
I said it like that.

01:07:19.824 --> 01:07:23.491
Look if you're not going
to shoot yourself, or me,

01:07:23.493 --> 01:07:25.895
then I have a plan,
It is kinda fucked up

01:07:25.897 --> 01:07:27.763
and totally suicidal,
but it might work.

01:07:27.765 --> 01:07:30.432
You get to kill Riktor,
I find Nova.

01:07:30.434 --> 01:07:33.403
But we have to work together.

01:07:34.271 --> 01:07:35.238
All right?

01:07:38.375 --> 01:07:40.375
I like that you're not
pointing that at me anymore.

01:07:40.377 --> 01:07:41.677
That's a good...
Okay...

01:07:41.679 --> 01:07:42.878
We can work on that.

01:07:50.755 --> 01:07:53.555
You only need to shoot me
one time!

01:07:53.557 --> 01:07:55.457
Really important.
Just one...

01:07:55.459 --> 01:07:56.894
right in the...

01:07:57.527 --> 01:07:59.494
Once.
Okay, you got that?

01:07:59.496 --> 01:08:01.296
I don't feel like
you're listening to me.

01:08:01.298 --> 01:08:02.430
Just one.

01:08:02.432 --> 01:08:05.366
One shot.

01:08:07.437 --> 01:08:08.838
I think my ribs are broken.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.438
Definitely have internal
bleeding.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.742
Cool, um, do you wanna
sit here and cry about it?

01:08:12.744 --> 01:08:13.845
Like a little bitch?

01:08:14.979 --> 01:08:15.945
Or do you wanna go shoot
a bunch of people in the face?

01:08:15.947 --> 01:08:17.447
Oh, hell yes.

01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:20.816
The face shooting one, not the...
not the crying.

01:08:20.818 --> 01:08:22.019
Right on.
Right on.

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:23.919
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

01:08:28.457 --> 01:08:29.992
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:29.993 --> 01:08:31.560
Just go. Come on, look.

01:08:31.996 --> 01:08:33.729
Me? Why do I have to go first?

01:08:33.731 --> 01:08:35.698
- Open the fucking door.
- I'm not exactly great

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.631
- at opening doors right now.
- Go on.

01:08:37.634 --> 01:08:39.334
Honestly
I still don't trust you.

01:08:39.336 --> 01:08:40.470
You might shoot me in the back.

01:08:41.604 --> 01:08:43.404
I promise that when I do
shoot you it'll be in the front.

01:08:43.406 --> 01:08:45.808
You have already shot me
like a dozen times.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:47.943
I feel bullets rattling
inside me when I walk.

01:08:47.944 --> 01:08:49.645
- Well...
- What the hell?

01:09:40.765 --> 01:09:42.462
Hey, sir!
It's Miles and Nix!

01:09:42.465 --> 01:09:44.532
They're in the building!
It's a clusterfuck!

01:09:44.533 --> 01:09:46.401
Yeah, and? What the fuck
you telling me for?

01:09:46.403 --> 01:09:47.569
Get the dead squad on it!

01:09:47.571 --> 01:09:49.073
- I can't.
- Well why not?

01:09:49.538 --> 01:09:51.709
- They're dead.
- They're dead?

01:09:53.044 --> 01:09:54.444
Well that's not ideal.

01:09:57.748 --> 01:09:59.148
Patch the monitor feeds
to the security cameras now!

01:10:02.119 --> 01:10:03.955
This is not happening.

01:10:04.989 --> 01:10:06.691
Oh, my God,
it's back on!

01:10:07.658 --> 01:10:08.824
It's going down.

01:10:10.695 --> 01:10:12.096
Oh, fantastic.

01:10:12.797 --> 01:10:15.430
I'm gonna lose
my fucking temper, this is...

01:10:15.432 --> 01:10:17.768
Effie! Dane!
Do your thing!

01:10:18.102 --> 01:10:19.434
Fuck them up!

01:10:19.436 --> 01:10:21.737
Nix and Miles!
They need to die!

01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:23.504
They need to fucking die!

01:10:29.512 --> 01:10:31.983
Suck on this, bitch!

01:10:32.582 --> 01:10:33.918
Really, another dick shot?

01:10:34.919 --> 01:10:36.852
Oh, God damn it, please.

01:10:36.854 --> 01:10:38.220
Why do you have to
keep doing that?

01:10:38.222 --> 01:10:39.788
What, I would have shot you
in the dick

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:41.522
if the target wasn't so small!

01:10:41.524 --> 01:10:42.892
It just seems
a little excessive.

01:10:42.894 --> 01:10:44.660
You know, you could go
dick shot, then head shot,

01:10:44.662 --> 01:10:46.695
then dick shot. Just mix it up
a little, something.

01:10:46.697 --> 01:10:47.999
It's basically a public service.

01:10:50.134 --> 01:10:51.734
Oh!
Don't do it again! God.

01:10:51.736 --> 01:10:53.568
Uh, you know, I don't...
I don't like it,

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:55.470
- I don't like it.
- It's just some dick blood.

01:10:55.472 --> 01:10:56.571
Miles?

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:20.763
- What was he thinking?
- Yeah,

01:11:20.765 --> 01:11:23.100
never bring
a spork to a gun fight, man.

01:11:27.038 --> 01:11:28.270
What are you doing?

01:11:28.272 --> 01:11:29.907
Trying to find where
they're holding Nova.

01:11:35.645 --> 01:11:37.647
Oh, God damn,
this comment section.

01:11:37.915 --> 01:11:39.516
It's like YouTube but worse.

01:11:40.918 --> 01:11:42.153
No, it's about the same.

01:11:43.854 --> 01:11:45.921
"I hope someone ices
that Nix bitch

01:11:45.923 --> 01:11:47.191
and tea bags her corpse."

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:51.727
That settles that,
I'm going to find every last

01:11:51.729 --> 01:11:53.796
one of those little trolls
and beat them to death

01:11:53.798 --> 01:11:55.731
- with their keyboards.
- You are fucking animals,

01:11:55.733 --> 01:11:56.734
you know that right.

01:11:58.002 --> 01:11:58.834
<i>You like this, you like
watching people suffer?</i>

01:11:58.836 --> 01:11:59.768
You like watching people
get hunted?

01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:02.570
If you didn't watch
they wouldn't exist

01:12:02.572 --> 01:12:05.810
<i>you pathetic sick fuck!</i>

01:12:06.609 --> 01:12:08.545
Fuck you, dude.

01:12:10.281 --> 01:12:12.915
Who the fuck is this guy, huh?
What the fuck.

01:12:12.917 --> 01:12:15.052
Hear, hear.
Good, good.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.154
Wish you had more volume.

01:12:17.755 --> 01:12:19.589
Intense.
Feel better now?

01:12:19.924 --> 01:12:21.558
You got that out of your system?

01:12:26.097 --> 01:12:28.065
- Whoa, holy shit.
- What?

01:12:28.966 --> 01:12:31.266
Look, Riktor,
he's trying to expand Skizm.

01:12:31.268 --> 01:12:33.838
He's like building it into
a global franchise.

01:12:38.743 --> 01:12:41.609
Can you actually just
like, send this to my Gmail?

01:12:41.611 --> 01:12:43.979
- It's funnier watching.
- Oh, God.

01:12:43.981 --> 01:12:45.816
Fuck you, man.

01:12:51.122 --> 01:12:54.990
Oh, holy shit!
Damn, nice AA-12!

01:12:54.992 --> 01:12:57.092
- Fuck.
- These things?

01:12:57.094 --> 01:12:58.861
- Yes!
- Yeah, I shelled out

01:12:58.863 --> 01:13:00.595
for the deep black PVD coating.

01:13:00.597 --> 01:13:04.199
But, now I kinda regret not
going with the UCP style camo.

01:13:04.201 --> 01:13:06.135
Oh, no you're crazy.
She's crazy.

01:13:06.137 --> 01:13:08.871
You totally own it.
Seriously.

01:13:08.873 --> 01:13:11.073
Thank you.
Yeah, you know your weapons.

01:13:11.075 --> 01:13:14.577
You know, shooting dip shits
in the head is life.

01:13:14.945 --> 01:13:17.780
Well, um, I better, you know.

01:13:17.782 --> 01:13:19.984
Right, yeah. Do your thing.
It was nice to meet you.

01:13:21.952 --> 01:13:23.687
Go! Go!

01:13:34.198 --> 01:13:35.299
Woo!

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.901
Watch the last step!
It's a doozie!

01:13:38.903 --> 01:13:40.004
Whoo.

01:13:42.639 --> 01:13:44.039
Oh.

01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:45.843
Someone
didn't skip leg day.

01:13:48.913 --> 01:13:50.647
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:13:51.015 --> 01:13:53.851
Don't pull my hair.

01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:07.765
Whoa! Whoo!

01:14:18.342 --> 01:14:19.143
Fuck!

01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:24.213
Friday night just got
really lonely!

01:14:33.457 --> 01:14:36.225
Just stay still and die,
you fucking coward.

01:14:36.227 --> 01:14:37.860
I really don't want to though.

01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:42.900
Fuck!

01:14:53.043 --> 01:14:54.812
Oh, shit!

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:07.825
Whoo!

01:15:10.227 --> 01:15:11.393
Didn't even hurt.

01:15:11.395 --> 01:15:13.397
Stop!
Hammer time!

01:15:20.905 --> 01:15:22.104
A bullet proof vest

01:15:22.106 --> 01:15:24.041
isn't gonna save you
from a head shot.

01:15:30.347 --> 01:15:32.149
Do you know
what your problem is?

01:15:35.286 --> 01:15:37.021
You need to smile more.

01:15:41.892 --> 01:15:43.794
Let's give you a nice...

01:15:44.195 --> 01:15:45.196
wide...

01:15:45.396 --> 01:15:46.897
juicy grin.

01:15:52.369 --> 01:15:56.538
I have the power!

01:16:05.849 --> 01:16:08.250
It's time to realign
your chakras.

01:16:08.252 --> 01:16:10.187
<i>♪ She's a very kinky girl ♪</i>

01:16:10.854 --> 01:16:13.490
<i>♪ The kind you don't take home
to mother ♪</i>

01:16:15.459 --> 01:16:16.961
Enough.

01:16:24.835 --> 01:16:26.337
I think I just heard a ball pop.

01:16:26.937 --> 01:16:28.305
Are they meant to pop?

01:16:32.076 --> 01:16:33.942
You don't like fire?

01:16:33.944 --> 01:16:35.145
Do ya, huh?

01:16:35.546 --> 01:16:38.080
Let's burn together, baby!

01:16:38.082 --> 01:16:39.147
Whoo!

01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:54.398
Fool!

01:16:58.569 --> 01:17:00.104
Don't shoot him!

01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:08.243
Yeah.
Chopper on the roof.

01:17:08.245 --> 01:17:09.980
No. Just two seats.

01:17:11.248 --> 01:17:14.051
No, everyone else is dead.

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:20.424
Why does everything have to be
so fucking stressful, hmm?

01:17:22.226 --> 01:17:25.861
You know, they say that
sometimes a nice little stroll

01:17:25.863 --> 01:17:27.798
can help to clear the head.

01:17:29.867 --> 01:17:31.802
- Come on, let's go.
- Get off me!

01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:35.003
That's it, that's it.

01:17:35.005 --> 01:17:36.106
Fuck!

01:17:39.276 --> 01:17:40.277
Hey.

01:17:41.879 --> 01:17:42.880
You good?

01:17:45.282 --> 01:17:49.520
Did you not hear me say

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:51.353
don't shoot?

01:17:51.355 --> 01:17:53.090
Woah...

01:17:53.557 --> 01:17:57.027
Yeah, you pull off the Rocky
look real well at least.

01:17:59.664 --> 01:18:01.463
What?
What is that?

01:18:01.465 --> 01:18:02.998
- What are you trying to do?
- Shit!

01:18:08.072 --> 01:18:09.638
Oh right...

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.406
Hey, no, no, no.
You gotta put that on ice.

01:18:11.408 --> 01:18:13.043
Come on, we gotta fix this.

01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:18.415
Oh, shit.

01:18:19.016 --> 01:18:21.016
I wasted all my bullets
on Sid Dickless.

01:18:21.018 --> 01:18:22.918
Riktor's got Nova somewhere,
I can't find her.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.589
Have you learned
nothing from video games?

01:18:26.123 --> 01:18:27.925
If you see enemies...

01:18:28.158 --> 01:18:30.594
You jump on their heads
and they give you coins?

01:18:31.362 --> 01:18:32.928
No, fuck wad!
It means we're going

01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:34.496
the right way.
Come on let's find some more

01:18:34.498 --> 01:18:36.467
- bad guys to shoot.
- Okay.

01:18:41.338 --> 01:18:42.504
Hey!

01:18:42.506 --> 01:18:44.339
Where the fuck are you
going, asshole?

01:18:44.341 --> 01:18:45.675
The action's back this way!

01:18:45.677 --> 01:18:47.142
Wait, you want me to go
out there

01:18:47.144 --> 01:18:47.976
and get my face shot off?

01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:49.378
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.179
Cops will be swarming
this place!

01:18:51.181 --> 01:18:52.381
This shit is over!

01:18:52.383 --> 01:18:56.017
It's not over until I say
it's over, you fucking traitor!

01:18:56.019 --> 01:18:57.119
Traitor?

01:18:57.121 --> 01:18:58.954
Without me,
you would be nothing!

01:18:58.956 --> 01:18:59.990
I mean, look at you!

01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:01.990
You look like someone
tried to paint a worn-out dildo

01:19:01.992 --> 01:19:04.126
- with a fucking Sharpie!
- Ah, that hurts.

01:19:04.128 --> 01:19:06.563
Face it, Riktor.
This is the end.

01:19:12.002 --> 01:19:14.638
Look at him go!
He's like a wounded deer.

01:19:16.039 --> 01:19:17.975
Go Bambi's mom, go!

01:19:27.251 --> 01:19:28.519
Kill them!

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:36.458
Was this the right way?

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.059
No we fucked up!

01:19:38.061 --> 01:19:39.930
- Far too many bad guys!
- Oh, God.

01:19:41.666 --> 01:19:42.700
Fuck.

01:19:43.668 --> 01:19:45.066
Oh, shit.

01:19:45.068 --> 01:19:46.535
What the hell
are we going to do?

01:19:46.537 --> 01:19:49.137
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

01:19:49.139 --> 01:19:51.408
Come on, get it.

01:19:52.009 --> 01:19:53.277
Hey! Hey!

01:19:53.678 --> 01:19:55.243
You want to know a secret?

01:19:55.245 --> 01:19:56.645
Fuck you!

01:19:56.647 --> 01:19:58.549
This was never about the money.

01:19:59.616 --> 01:20:01.151
This is about art.

01:20:02.219 --> 01:20:04.152
Murder is art.

01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:09.692
This one...

01:20:09.694 --> 01:20:11.628
This is a Jackson Pollock.

01:20:12.463 --> 01:20:13.464
Ah!

01:20:16.701 --> 01:20:18.435
Overcompensating much?

01:20:21.305 --> 01:20:22.707
Where the fuck are you going?

01:20:23.741 --> 01:20:25.207
Get up!

01:20:25.209 --> 01:20:26.711
Get the fuck up!

01:20:28.312 --> 01:20:31.079
You know, you really need
to cheer the fuck up.

01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:32.782
Are you not even
a little bit excited

01:20:32.784 --> 01:20:35.152
about going in
a chopper with me?

01:20:45.195 --> 01:20:46.729
You wanna know
how I survived this long?

01:20:46.731 --> 01:20:48.999
I don't know, Nix,
by being crazy as fuck?

01:20:50.133 --> 01:20:53.203
I didn't want to give any fucker
the satisfaction...

01:20:53.738 --> 01:20:55.205
of killing me.

01:20:57.341 --> 01:20:59.109
Just kill Riktor for me.

01:20:59.643 --> 01:21:00.678
Okay, mouse?

01:21:01.746 --> 01:21:03.078
Get the fuck out here
so I can shoot you!

01:21:04.314 --> 01:21:05.616
Wait. No, wait!

01:21:25.602 --> 01:21:26.637
No!

01:21:38.615 --> 01:21:39.649
Nix!

01:22:02.272 --> 01:22:04.274
Fuck.

01:22:05.409 --> 01:22:06.410
Come back here.

01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:08.312
Where'd you think you're going?

01:22:10.581 --> 01:22:13.515
Get up there.
Come on.

01:22:57.527 --> 01:22:58.763
Oh, shit!
Oh...

01:23:10.742 --> 01:23:12.542
Fuck! Nova!

01:23:17.247 --> 01:23:18.248
Nova!

01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:20.615
Miles! Miles!

01:23:20.617 --> 01:23:21.753
"Miles!"

01:23:23.721 --> 01:23:24.889
There you are.

01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:28.358
What took you so long, hmm?

01:23:30.293 --> 01:23:31.794
You made it all this way.

01:23:31.796 --> 01:23:34.529
I even got you a rooftop
for the showdown!

01:23:34.531 --> 01:23:36.899
Nix is dead, it's over!

01:23:36.901 --> 01:23:38.366
Let Nova go!

01:23:41.706 --> 01:23:43.005
Oh, finally!

01:23:43.007 --> 01:23:44.774
I should have ordered
a fucking Uber!

01:23:44.776 --> 01:23:46.608
<i>Okay, okay and we're back.</i>

01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:48.510
<i>We've got our stream back,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:23:48.512 --> 01:23:49.544
<i>Oh, thank fuck!</i>

01:23:49.546 --> 01:23:51.379
<i>Let's just see how this ends,
I guess.</i>

01:23:51.381 --> 01:23:52.382
Oh, yeah.

01:23:56.788 --> 01:23:59.689
Ten million concurrent viewers,
Miles.

01:23:59.691 --> 01:24:02.725
You have just made
Skizm history!

01:24:02.727 --> 01:24:04.526
You are somebody!

01:24:04.528 --> 01:24:05.763
I took...

01:24:06.931 --> 01:24:09.934
a worthless piece of shit
and I molded it into steel!

01:24:10.534 --> 01:24:11.667
I made you, Miles.

01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:14.837
You should be down on
your fucking knees thanking me!

01:24:14.839 --> 01:24:16.538
Oh, fuck you man!

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.474
All you did was ruin my hands,
and give me a criminal record.

01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:21.276
I never wanted any of this!

01:24:21.278 --> 01:24:24.214
Don't give me that
goody-goody bullshit!

01:24:25.415 --> 01:24:27.750
What were you doing
on the Skizm site to begin with?

01:24:27.752 --> 01:24:28.686
Hey?

01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:32.957
Admit it, you wanted
to feel something.

01:24:33.423 --> 01:24:35.725
You wanted to... to...
to hunt like a man.

01:24:35.727 --> 01:24:37.827
You wanted to be somebody!

01:24:37.829 --> 01:24:39.895
Yesterday
you were fucking miserable!

01:24:39.897 --> 01:24:41.699
Now, look at yourself.

01:24:41.966 --> 01:24:43.735
You're alive!

01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:47.370
Yeah, I am.

01:24:47.905 --> 01:24:49.707
And that's more than I can say
for you.

01:25:05.723 --> 01:25:08.323
Oh.

01:25:08.325 --> 01:25:10.460
Hey, man, nice shot!

01:25:12.429 --> 01:25:13.430
Fuck.

01:25:13.998 --> 01:25:14.999
No!

01:25:20.004 --> 01:25:21.469
Oh, that's a better one.

01:25:21.471 --> 01:25:23.406
He's down!
He's down!

01:25:24.508 --> 01:25:26.343
Oh, relax will ya?

01:25:30.514 --> 01:25:31.749
Come on, Miles.

01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:42.359
No.

01:25:43.027 --> 01:25:44.896
Nova!

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.701
Just fucking die!

01:25:59.442 --> 01:26:01.376
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- He just took three

01:26:01.378 --> 01:26:02.678
fucking bullets!

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.645
