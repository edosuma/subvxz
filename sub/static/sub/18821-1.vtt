08:09.557 --> 08:12.701

08:24.337 --> 08:26.574
- Love you.
- Who would you do something like this?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.483
You don't talk much
but you damn sure can eat.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.996
That's all right, baby.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.489
You ain't got to talk
'til you get good and ready.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.563
My name is Chiron.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.802
People call me Little.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.339
All right then, Little.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.952
Well Im'ma call you

09:37.077 --> 09:39.012
Where you from, Chiron?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.982

09:43.483 --> 09:45.052
You live with your mama?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.187
Yes.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.489
What about your daddy?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.464
That's all right.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.978
You want us to take you home, then, after
you get finished eating your food?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.405
Yeah, you gotta tell us

10:09.877 --> 10:11.244
No...

10:14.682 --> 10:15.849
Okay.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.994
You can stay here tonight.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.587

10:22.022 --> 10:23.657
Would you like that?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.696
Okay.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.973
What happened?

11:14.041 --> 11:15.250
Huh?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.785
What happened, Chiron?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.087
Why you didn't come home
like you supposed to?

11:19.212 --> 11:20.580
Huh?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.660
And who is you?

11:24.785 --> 11:26.153
Nobody.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.789
I found him yesterday.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.825
Found him in a hole on 15th.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.295
Yeah.
That one.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.740
Some boys chased him in the cut.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.675
He's scared more than anything.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.878
He wouldn't tell me where
he lived 'til this morning.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.714
Well, thanks for seeing to him.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.341
He usually can
take care of hisself...

11:49.276 --> 11:51.244

11:55.615 --> 11:57.150

13:37.951 --> 13:39.419

14:27.700 --> 14:29.102

14:30.437 --> 14:32.047

15:00.600 --> 15:02.344
Why you say that?

15:02.469 --> 15:04.371
You just is, that's all.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.451
Why do you always let people
pick on you, man?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.086
What you mean?

15:11.211 --> 15:13.221
You always letting them
pick on you.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.623
So what I gotta do?

15:15.748 --> 15:19.794
All you gotta do is show
these niggas you ain't soft.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.229
But I ain't soft.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.031
I know, I know.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.668
But it don't mean nothing
if they don't know it.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.003
Come on.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.463
You want these fools
to pick on you every day?

16:12.039 --> 16:13.916
See Little?

16:14.041 --> 16:15.942
I knew you wasn't soft.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.023
Come on, man.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.884
Give me your head.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.164
Let your head rest in my hand.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.498
Relax.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.434
I got you.
I promise.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.036
I'm not going to let you go.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.038
Hey man, I got you.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.530
There you go.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.566
Ten seconds.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.136
Feel that right there?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.906
You're in the middle
of the world, man.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.342
That's good.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.146
Do like this.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.893
Look at you.

18:39.018 --> 18:40.553
More athletic.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.123
There you go.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.894
Yeah.
I think you ready.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.830
I think we got a swimmer.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.700
You wanna try?
You ready to swim?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.469
Go.

19:00.973 --> 19:06.221
Yeah, man!

19:06.346 --> 19:07.780
Yeah!

19:29.702 --> 19:31.379
Let me tell you something, man.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.473
There are black people
everywhere.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.376
You remember that, okay?

19:37.244 --> 19:39.221
No place you can go in the world
ain't got no black people.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.248
We was the first ones
on this planet.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.119
I been here a long time...

19:48.688 --> 19:50.223
but I'm from Cuba.

19:51.758 --> 19:55.662
Lotta black folks in Cuba, but you
wouldn't know it from being here, though.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.906
I was a wild li'l shorty, man.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.442
Just like you.

20:00.567 --> 20:04.070
Runnin' around with no shoes on
when the moon was out.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.574
This one time...

20:08.575 --> 20:12.187
I run by this old...
this old lady.

20:12.312 --> 20:16.683
I was runnin', hollerin'...
and cuttin' a fool, boy.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.528
This old lady, she stopped me.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.021
She said...

20:24.557 --> 20:28.661
"Running around...
catching up all that light.

20:30.730 --> 20:34.501
In moonlight...
black boys look blue.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.437
You blue.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.308
That's what I gon' call you.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.010
Blue."

20:47.079 --> 20:48.715
So your name Blue?

20:51.784 --> 20:52.952
Nah.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.629
At some point you gotta decide
for yourself who you gonna be.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.700
Can't let nobody make
that decision for you.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.551
How you like swimming, man?

21:25.718 --> 21:26.853
Hmm?

21:27.687 --> 21:29.589
That much, huh?

21:32.024 --> 21:33.493
Hey, hold up, hold up.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.767
Pick one.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.739
Aah...

21:47.974 --> 21:49.909
Ha ha. Good choice.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.278
Put it in your pocket.

22:04.357 --> 22:05.358
Hey.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.928
Yo, hold up.
Whoa, whoa, hey...

22:17.404 --> 22:18.871
Come on.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.178
What's going on, Little Man?

22:27.514 --> 22:28.781
Come on!

23:24.504 --> 23:28.149
Man, they're all the same

23:28.274 --> 23:30.652
At least mine don't look
like Freddy Kruger.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.687
Yours ugly as hell.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.122
Mine don't look like no peanut.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.625
Telling you, mine does not
look like no peanut.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.318
Who let his ass in?

23:46.659 --> 23:47.994
Somebody with you?

23:50.029 --> 23:52.364
Man, I swear it was locked.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.167
Man, ain't no foul. Ain't no foul.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.327
S'up?!

24:22.529 --> 24:24.497
You're dead, baby!
Right in your face!

26:23.349 --> 26:26.127
It's what I paid for.
It ain't what I bought.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.495
Man, that's Grade A quality.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.963
What else you want me to do?

26:29.088 --> 26:31.298
Nigga, this shit look more like Grade C.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.700
Man, look.
I ain't goin' with that, man!

26:32.825 --> 26:33.835
I want my money back.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.302
What?!
Ain't no refund, man.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.896
Just stuff it, man.
Keep movin'. Go on.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.802
Yo what's up?
You all right?

26:45.838 --> 26:47.381

Your boyfriend's here.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.274
Boy.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.978
You talking to me today?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.480
Huh?

31:24.150 --> 31:25.284
Okay.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.628
That's alright.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.421
I don't wanna talk to you,
anyway.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.696
You know she got
a crush on you, right?

31:41.400 --> 31:42.701
You all right?

31:46.872 --> 31:48.474
You walk all the way here?

31:52.311 --> 31:54.188
All right.

31:54.313 --> 31:57.316
First things first.
You can't sit at my table like that.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.353
You can't sit with your back
to the door, come on.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.624
Ain't gonna know if somebody
creepin' up on you.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.203
All right, see that?

32:09.328 --> 32:11.197
Now you can see everything.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.049
What's over there?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.427
I saw your mama last night.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.232
I hate her.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.367
Hmm.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.403
Yeah, I bet you do.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.440
I hated my mom, too.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.878
I miss her like hell now though.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.585
That's all I'm gon' say
about that.

33:15.261 --> 33:16.428
Thank you.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.707
What's a faggot?

33:39.218 --> 33:41.087
A faggot is...

33:46.058 --> 33:49.295
a word used
to make gay people feel bad.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.779
- Am I a faggot?
- No.

33:58.904 --> 34:00.206
No.

34:01.673 --> 34:05.111
You can be gay, but you gotta
let nobody call you no faggot.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.681
I mean, unless...

34:17.755 --> 34:19.190
How do I know?

34:20.926 --> 34:22.360
You just do.

34:23.661 --> 34:24.963
I think.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.135
You'll know when you know.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.004
Hey...

34:35.373 --> 34:38.476
You ain't gotta know right now,
all right?

34:40.478 --> 34:42.013
Not yet.

34:53.958 --> 34:55.893
Do you sell drugs?

35:08.307 --> 35:09.375
Yeah.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.581
And my mama...

35:16.548 --> 35:18.350

35:22.821 --> 35:23.989
Yeah.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.914
Okay, deoxyribonucleic acid.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.048
Long word, right?

36:15.173 --> 36:16.617
All right, it's basically genes.

36:16.742 --> 36:20.621
I know y'all don't know what that means
but just hang with me for a second.

36:20.746 --> 36:26.460
So it's basically this long...
Chiron, you need something?

36:26.585 --> 36:29.087
Hey yo, that nigga forgot
to change his tampon.

36:30.489 --> 36:31.732
I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.467
He just having
woman problems today.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.736
Ain't that right, Little?
- All right, Terrel, that's enough.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.571
Nah, can't be enough for Little..

36:37.696 --> 36:38.972
How much you need, Little?

36:39.097 --> 36:40.974
- Don't call me that!
- All right Terrel, that's it.

36:41.099 --> 36:45.479
Hey, what you gonna do, Chiron?
I'll fuck you up.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.573
Hey yo, Terrel, out!

36:49.308 --> 36:50.942
Come on, man.
What's wrong with you?

36:58.550 --> 36:59.526
Where were we?

36:59.651 --> 37:05.357
DNA is basically
this long model...

37:15.801 --> 37:18.136
Im'ma be waitin'
for your ass, Little.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.022
Come on, Chiron.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.862
Chiron, what's up, man?

37:45.096 --> 37:48.209
Damn, nigga.
You straight spaced, dawg.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.502
Yo, school been out.
You ain't going home?

37:51.637 --> 37:54.080
Uh... What you doin' here?

37:54.205 --> 37:55.449
Detention, man.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.651
Aimes caught me with this trick
in the stairway.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.520
- Damn.
- Yeah.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.021
With who?

38:01.146 --> 38:02.848
Damn, you nosey, nigga.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.025
- My bad...
- No, I'm playing, yo.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.893
Look, I wanted
some quick head you know,

38:07.018 --> 38:09.363
but this chick all like
"Hit that shit, Kevin.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.964
Hit it with that big dick."

38:11.089 --> 38:13.200
Why she got to
compliment a nigga for?

38:13.325 --> 38:16.237
So I'm like "A'ight. Shit.
We can do this", you know?

38:16.362 --> 38:17.871
So I started
banging her back out, dawg.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.674
I'm talking
I'm banging her back out.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.776
She went and made
all this fucking noise though.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.713
So Aimes come in, acted all five-O and
shit, almost had my ass suspended, dawg.

38:26.838 --> 38:27.981
I talked it out, though.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.883
I told him we was like
childhood sweethearts and all of that,

38:30.008 --> 38:32.243
so I just got detention,
it's cool.

38:33.178 --> 38:36.056
- Cool.

38:36.181 --> 38:37.048
Yeah.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.718
I know you can
keep a secret, dawg.

38:41.820 --> 38:45.023
Real talk though, I gotta go, a'ight,
before this fool change his mind.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.393
All right, Kev.

38:48.527 --> 38:49.895
See you, Black.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.982
- Hey, mama.
- Uh-uh. You cannot be here tonight.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.376
I got company coming.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.914
Find somewhere for you to be.

39:45.951 --> 39:48.153
Find somewhere for you to be.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.862
All right...

39:57.829 --> 40:02.067

and a little gin for you.

40:03.569 --> 40:04.878
Boy please.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.780
I know Juan used to
give you that gin.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.174
But we ain't doing that
up in here, Shorty.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.778
You don't think
my joke was funny?

40:20.251 --> 40:21.853
What's wrong?

40:23.121 --> 40:24.523
Nothing.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.400
I'm good.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.001
No.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.962
I've seen good and you ain't it.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.808
Stop putting your head down
in my house.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.042
You know my rule.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.312
It's all love
and all pride in this house.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.906
You feel me?

40:46.612 --> 40:48.154
I can't hear you.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.656
Do you feel me?

40:49.781 --> 40:50.849
Yeah.

40:51.483 --> 40:53.326
- Okay.
- I feel you.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.086
All right.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.203
Thank you for this.

41:03.328 --> 41:08.274
Boy, please, you know you can stay
here any time you need to, okay?

41:08.399 --> 41:09.735
Any time.

41:10.235 --> 41:11.503
Yeah.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.874
Thank you, Teresa.
I mean it.

41:16.975 --> 41:21.455
Now, if you gon' stay here, though, you
gonna have to learn how to make a bed

41:21.580 --> 41:23.181
better than this, boy.

41:23.949 --> 41:26.326
- What?
- What you mean, "what"?

41:26.451 --> 41:28.687
Give me that.
That ain't how you make up no bed.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.500
You think you slick, too.

41:33.625 --> 41:37.370
You know, do it all wrong so Teresa
can come over here and do it right.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.739
Mm-hmm.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.373
I know what you doing.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.734
Oof, you and Juan.

41:43.468 --> 41:46.146
Y'all two, thick as thieves.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.438
Give me that.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.922
All right.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.826
Do you need anything else
from me, sweetheart?

42:09.394 --> 42:10.904
Uh, no, I'm good.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.430
Okay.

42:13.799 --> 42:16.401
All right, I'm gonna
wake you up in the morning.

43:11.522 --> 43:12.991
You good, Black?

43:34.279 --> 43:35.989
Chiron!

43:36.114 --> 43:39.125
- Hey! Hey, baby!
- Hey, Mama.

43:39.250 --> 43:41.662
Where'd you go last night?

43:41.787 --> 43:43.054
What?

43:44.455 --> 43:45.365
Why?

43:45.490 --> 43:47.492
I'm yo' mama, ain't I?

43:49.294 --> 43:52.238
Why you ain't just
come home later, boy?

43:52.363 --> 43:54.232
You had me worried about you.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.936
I guess you getting grown.

43:59.237 --> 44:02.073
I can't be keeping up with you
all the time.

44:03.975 --> 44:07.821
Anyway baby, how Teresa doing?

44:07.946 --> 44:10.415
I ain't seen her
since the funeral.

44:11.516 --> 44:14.160
Listen, Mama locked herself
out the door, yeah?

44:14.285 --> 44:16.187
Can you come let her in?

44:21.359 --> 44:22.761
Come on, baby.

44:23.528 --> 44:24.930
Let me in, baby.

44:26.497 --> 44:27.866
Baby, come on.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.538
I thought you said...

44:34.639 --> 44:36.374
Mama, I thought you...

44:37.042 --> 44:38.910
Wait, Mama... Mama!

44:57.796 --> 44:59.397
I need some money.

45:00.932 --> 45:02.208
For what?

45:02.333 --> 45:03.677
That's my business.

45:03.802 --> 45:06.271
Don't you ask me
no shit like that.

45:07.773 --> 45:10.150
- I don't have no money...
- No, no. Don't lie to me, boy.

45:10.275 --> 45:11.652
I'm your mama.

45:11.777 --> 45:13.620
That bitch over there
ain't no kin of you.

45:13.745 --> 45:16.156
I'm your blood, remember?

45:16.281 --> 45:18.324
Now I ain't feeling good.

45:18.449 --> 45:21.019
I need something to help me out.

45:21.787 --> 45:23.254
Come on, baby.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.490
Come on, baby.

45:26.992 --> 45:29.069
Where I'm supposed
to get money from?

45:29.194 --> 45:30.161
What?

45:31.229 --> 45:34.808
Teresa ain't give you nothing,
huh?

45:34.933 --> 45:39.145
Your li'l play-play mama ain't
put something in your hand?

45:39.270 --> 45:41.447
Give me that damn money, Chiron.

45:41.572 --> 45:44.184
Give me the damn money!
Give me the damn money!

45:44.309 --> 45:46.352
I don't have no money!

45:46.477 --> 45:48.121
- Mama, come on...
- Give me the damn money!

45:48.246 --> 45:49.622
- Mama, come on...
- Give me the damn money!

45:49.747 --> 45:51.524
All right! All right!

45:51.649 --> 45:53.051
Give me the damn money.

45:56.387 --> 45:57.864
Here, man.

45:57.989 --> 46:00.959
Yes.
That is what I thought.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.671
I know that bitch like a hooker
know her trick.

46:04.796 --> 46:06.272
You my child, okay?

46:06.397 --> 46:09.375
And tell that bitch
she better not forget it.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.236
Go on to school.

46:12.137 --> 46:13.471
Ain't you late?

46:23.681 --> 46:25.992
So you can see how a lack
of white blood cells

46:26.117 --> 46:28.887
can be dangerous
to the human body, right?

46:32.457 --> 46:35.736
Okay, can anybody explain
what will happen to the body

46:35.861 --> 46:38.029
if there's not enough
white blood cells?

46:39.965 --> 46:42.809
Ain't nobody's leaving this
classroom until I get a response.

46:42.934 --> 46:46.437
This is more important for you
than it is for me, trust me.

46:54.145 --> 46:55.580
Hey yo, Little!

46:56.514 --> 46:57.623

47:17.702 --> 47:20.146
Talkin' like a rock

47:20.271 --> 47:21.506
Nigga, what was that?!

47:23.074 --> 47:24.184

47:45.463 --> 47:48.308
Yo, why your jeans so tight?

47:48.433 --> 47:49.976
Yo, Pizzo, you see

Well, nice to see you too.

49:52.590 --> 49:54.434
What you doing out here?

49:54.559 --> 49:57.028
This is my smoker habitat,
nigga.

49:58.663 --> 50:00.465
Oh what, you smoke out here too?

50:02.433 --> 50:03.901
Something like that...

50:04.535 --> 50:06.546
Nah, you don't smoke.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.139
Why you pretending?

50:09.640 --> 50:11.709
Trying to put on a show
for me, Black?

50:14.212 --> 50:15.813
Why you always calling me that?

50:16.714 --> 50:18.583
- What, Black?
- Yeah, Black.

50:19.717 --> 50:21.786
That's my nickname for you.
You don't like it?

50:23.954 --> 50:29.460
No, it's just... what kind of dude goes
around giving other dudes nicknames?

50:30.595 --> 50:32.038
The kind of dude
what just sat down

50:32.163 --> 50:34.665
and is about to put you
onto this blunt, nigga.

50:36.101 --> 50:37.310
Yeah.

50:37.435 --> 50:39.145
You like the water?

50:39.270 --> 50:41.339
I can introduce you
to some "fiyah."

51:04.962 --> 51:07.098
Come on, nigga.
It ain't gonna bite you.

51:36.627 --> 51:38.696
Damn, I didn't know
you smoked like that.

51:41.266 --> 51:43.634
My mom leaves
all types of shit around.

52:02.687 --> 52:04.622
That breeze
feel good as hell man.

52:06.457 --> 52:07.892
Yeah, it do.

52:09.660 --> 52:14.599
Sometimes round the way, where we live...
you can catch that same breeze.

52:16.867 --> 52:20.371
It just come through the hood and it's
like everything stop for a second...

52:21.339 --> 52:23.883
'cause everyone
just wanna feel it.

52:24.008 --> 52:26.344
Everything just gets quiet,
you know?

52:28.379 --> 52:32.092
And it's like all you can hear
is your own heartbeat.

52:32.217 --> 52:33.618
Right?

52:35.320 --> 52:36.754
Yeah...

52:38.155 --> 52:39.199

52:42.493 --> 52:45.930
Hell, shit make you wanna cry,

You cry?

52:53.271 --> 52:54.705

52:55.606 --> 52:57.242
Makes me want to.

53:01.246 --> 53:02.980
What you cry about?

53:06.651 --> 53:11.322
Shit, I cry so much sometimes I feel
like I'm gon' just turn into drops.

53:16.193 --> 53:18.396
Think you can roll out
into the water, right?

53:20.097 --> 53:22.108
Roll out into the water like
all these other motherfuckers

53:22.233 --> 53:24.402
around here
trying to drown they sorrows.

53:26.904 --> 53:28.205
Why you say that?

53:29.073 --> 53:31.075

nigga.

53:33.043 --> 53:35.179
Sound like something

53:37.548 --> 53:40.285
I wanna do a lot of things
that don't make sense.

53:43.921 --> 53:45.856
I didn't say
it don't make sense.

53:50.995 --> 53:54.207
But tell me, like-like what?

53:54.332 --> 53:56.267

56:27.485 --> 56:29.920
You ain't never done nothing

56:46.403 --> 56:48.072
Thanks for the ride, man.

56:49.073 --> 56:50.541

58:04.481 --> 58:05.950
Hmm?

58:07.151 --> 58:09.353
You don't love me no more...

58:12.690 --> 58:14.458
You're my only.

58:16.260 --> 58:18.028
I'm your only.

58:21.699 --> 58:23.534
You're my only...

58:45.923 --> 58:48.559

58:49.860 --> 58:51.937
Hey, you know a nigga

58:52.062 --> 58:53.731
No, I hear you, man.

58:54.599 --> 58:57.276
Lunch used to be the shit,
though.

58:57.401 --> 58:59.612
Nah, the food wasn't never good.

58:59.737 --> 59:01.647
Man, I ain't talkin'
'bout the food.

59:01.772 --> 59:04.784
But that Friday pizza
was the shit.

59:04.909 --> 59:06.151
Yeah, I feel you.

59:06.276 --> 59:10.255
Nah, but you remember in middle
school, that game we used to play?

59:10.380 --> 59:12.349

59:13.417 --> 59:16.195
Yeah yo, my crazy ass

59:16.320 --> 59:17.463
Yeah I remember. Yo!

59:17.588 --> 59:19.331
You remember that white kid

59:22.292 --> 59:24.870
Oh yeah! Yo, you fucked

Yeah.

59:29.867 --> 59:33.646
Yo, but, uh... niggas don't

59:33.771 --> 59:36.340
I mean... you know...

59:39.243 --> 59:40.110
What you sayin'?

59:41.145 --> 59:46.583
I'm sayin' is, if I point a nigga out...
is you gonna knock his ass down?

59:50.621 --> 59:52.832
That's the game, ain't it?

59:52.957 --> 59:55.367
You dare me to swing on him
and if I do, it's on you.

59:55.492 --> 59:58.128
A'ight.
A'ight Kev.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:01.165
Let me see who ass

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:04.176
Don't be drinking
none of this gummy juice.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.036
Shit'll kill you.

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:56.453
Yo, Kev.

01:00:59.924 --> 01:01:01.391
Hit that nigga.

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:03.769
Hit that nigga, Kev.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.863
Yeah, hit his faggot ass!

01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:10.467
The fuck you waitin' on?
Do it! Come on.

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:13.337
Let's go.

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:20.577
How you like that, Chiron?

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.789
Yo, I think he want another.

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:25.457
Another one. Do it.

01:01:25.582 --> 01:01:27.151
Give it to him.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:32.765
Don't you get up, bruh.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:33.966
You stay down!

01:01:34.091 --> 01:01:36.602
Yeah if he get back up,
knock his faggot ass back down.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:39.396
- Chiron, stay down!
- He got up.

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:42.274
Come on, man.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:43.275
Stay down.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.835
Do it again.

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.438
Do it! Do it!

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:19.269
Listen, son...

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:27.219
If you don't press charges...
I can't stop this from happening.

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:28.712
Understand?

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:34.626
You don't even know.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.154
- Oh I don't?
- Nu-uh.

01:02:38.022 --> 01:02:39.799
You think all this
just started, boy?

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.492
- I ain't no boy.
- The hell you ain't.

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:48.698
If you were a man there'd be four other
knuckleheads sittin' right next to you.

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:58.442
You don't even know.

01:02:59.944 --> 01:03:02.287
Listen, son, listen.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:03.889
Listen.

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:07.651
I'm not blaming you...
I'm not.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.864
I know it's hard.

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:13.557
Believe me.

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.995
I'm not trying to disrespect
your struggle.

01:03:19.864 --> 01:03:22.399
I just need you to know...

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.162
All right, all right.
Stay focused.

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.436
Hey... Hey, Chiron!

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:14.844
Get the fuck off me, niggas!

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.219
Get the fuck off me!

01:06:27.384 --> 01:06:28.385
Don't look at me!

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:37.454

- Yo, what's good with you, B?

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:40.599

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:56.601
I told you to count what's off
and you said it wasn't.

01:09:56.726 --> 01:09:58.937
That's you calling me a liar.

01:09:59.062 --> 01:10:02.899

01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:16.065
Man, I had to ask Teresa
for your number, and...

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:22.439
Hold on, man.
You do-you do remember me, right?

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.944
Yeah, I do.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.423

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:34.083
Yeah. Yeah, it has, man.

01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:38.422
So, uh, where you at now, man?

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.825

01:12:42.426 --> 01:12:43.927
Atlanta.

01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:49.741
I've been up here ever since... Yeah.
Yeah, man, that's what I heard.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.435
Yeah.

01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:08.360
Hey, man, I'm sorry about all that... All
that... shit what went down... Chiron.

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:10.487
Real shit, dawg, I am.

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:23.366
So, uh...

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.302

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:28.938
Not much. Just...

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:31.307
just trouble.

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:36.388
Chiron and trouble
always found a way.

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:38.782
Yeah... something like that.

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.597
What about you?

01:13:45.722 --> 01:13:46.956
Me?

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.659
I'm a cook, man.

01:13:52.496 --> 01:13:54.506
Y-y-you a cook?

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:56.332
Yeah, buddy.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.444
Man, I got sent up
for some stupid shit-

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:02.080
the same stupid shit
we always get sent up for.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:06.309
They put me on the kitchen line,
man, and I kinda took to it.

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:11.390
Anyway, man, I just... I just
thought about you, man. I...

01:14:11.515 --> 01:14:15.794
We got this jukebox in here and, uh...
and folks come by and play they songs,

01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:17.921
that's the music
we get in here...

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.890
This dude, man...

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.862

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:30.333
So, uh...

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:36.080
Hey man, if you ever come to town, man,
you come holla at me.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:37.841
I'll cook you somethin'.

01:14:38.575 --> 01:14:39.776
Maybe...

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.378
Maybe play that song for you.

01:14:44.548 --> 01:14:47.350

01:16:39.796 --> 01:16:41.330

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:43.875
I'm all right.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.309
I ain't sleepin'.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.803
Why not?

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:50.314
- Right. If you knew you'd...
- Bad dreamin'.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.908
Still?

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:57.313
You ever thought about talking
about it with somebody?

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:01.092
Maybe not even a counsellor.

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:03.552
Maybe somebody like your mama?

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:11.594
Yeah... Yeah, it sound
funny to me too.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.166
You talk to Teresa?

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:19.869
Yeah.

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:22.071

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:24.749

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:26.442
"Good."

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:33.116
When you go home, Ma?

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:35.719
Home?

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:41.900
This is home. You know... I mean,
they allowing me to stay and work

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:47.596
as long as I like. I figure...
might as well help other folks.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.533
Keep myself out of trouble.

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:56.380
That's good, Mama.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.082
Yeah.

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:00.418
Yeah, I think it is too.

01:18:00.543 --> 01:18:02.245
I really do.

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:09.352
So, you still in them streets?

01:18:13.957 --> 01:18:15.667
Didn't come all the way

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:18.269
to have you fallin' in the same shit, Chiron.
- Im'ma go. Im'ma go...

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:20.171
No, no, no, no, you gon' listen!

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:22.540
To who, Ma? Huh?

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.008
To you?

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:25.835
Really, though?

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.738
Please...

01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:30.639
Please...

01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:44.320
I messed up.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:49.826
I fucked it all the way up.

01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:53.329
I know that.

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:58.467
But yo' heart ain't gotta be
black like mine, baby.

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.375
I love you, Chiron.

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:09.779
I do.

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:14.617
I love you, baby.

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:18.797
But you ain't gotta love me.

01:19:18.922 --> 01:19:23.326
Lord knows I did not have love for
you when you needed it, I know that.

01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:27.130
So you ain't gotta love me...

01:19:28.397 --> 01:19:31.567
but you gon' know
that I love you.

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:35.704
You hear?

01:19:38.207 --> 01:19:40.076
You hear me, Chiron?

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:44.814
I hear you, Mama.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.928

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:40.436
I'm so sorry.

01:20:51.414 --> 01:20:53.082
Come here, Mama.

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.345
Be right with you.

01:23:58.934 --> 01:24:00.378

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:01.779

01:24:05.108 --> 01:24:06.442
I'll be right back

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:14.650
Be right with you, boss, just

01:24:28.697 --> 01:24:30.333

01:24:58.261 --> 01:24:59.995

Damn, bother, I thought

01:29:08.911 --> 01:29:09.987
Chill out, bruh.

Hey, eat your dinner, man.

01:29:19.388 --> 01:29:21.089

01:30:18.614 --> 01:30:22.217
We had him young, too young.

01:30:25.821 --> 01:30:28.932
Man, when I got locked up,
man, that shit was hard.

01:30:29.057 --> 01:30:30.634
Wasn't no way I could
go back the streets, man.

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:32.360

01:30:58.854 --> 01:31:00.489
I mean, what you doin'?

01:31:01.557 --> 01:31:03.526
Who you doin'?

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:07.571
Man, come on now.

01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:08.972
I've been back there

01:31:09.097 --> 01:31:13.511

man, hey, these grandma rules, man.

01:31:13.636 --> 01:31:14.912
You know the deal.

01:31:15.037 --> 01:31:17.740
Your ass eat, your ass speak.

01:31:24.379 --> 01:31:26.356
All right, straight up?

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.083

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:39.662

01:31:40.362 --> 01:31:45.443
When they sent me to Atlanta, put me
straight into juvie for beatin' the old boy.

01:31:45.568 --> 01:31:47.402
Met this dude in there.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:50.948
When I come out,
he put me on the block.

01:31:51.073 --> 01:31:53.208
Did good at it and rose up.

01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:56.712
It is what it is.

01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:00.983
Bullshit, man.

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:03.919
That ain't what it is.

01:32:04.687 --> 01:32:06.955
That ain't you, Chiron.

01:32:08.991 --> 01:32:10.826
Nigga, you don't know me.

01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:16.865
I don't know you?

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:35.350
There you are.

01:32:39.054 --> 01:32:40.689

01:33:58.701 --> 01:34:00.402
Why'd you call me?

01:34:01.403 --> 01:34:02.738
What?

01:34:04.907 --> 01:34:06.875
Why did you call me?

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:15.884
I told you, man... dude came in...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:34:23.692 --> 01:34:25.794
He played this song, man...

01:36:39.862 --> 01:36:41.229
This you?

01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:47.702
You wasn't playin'

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.121
Ride dirty, huh?

01:37:07.455 --> 01:37:08.723
Something like that.

01:37:15.297 --> 01:37:17.099
So how you be in to work?

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:19.877

01:37:22.104 --> 01:37:25.540
Sometimes Samantha shoot me out

01:37:27.542 --> 01:37:31.221
I can't picture bein' in Miami
with no car.

01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:34.591
- Man, it's real out here.
- Yeah, I bet.

01:37:34.716 --> 01:37:39.797
Real hot, real slow,
and real busted.

01:37:39.922 --> 01:37:42.265
Shot me like a duck
out here, man.

01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:44.935
This nigga said "a duck."

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:48.038
- Yeah, you on one.
- You know what I'm doin'.

You was pouring it.

01:40:45.407 --> 01:40:47.617

Hey, hey, hey, I ain't tryin'

01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:02.584
I ain't seen you
in a minute and...

01:42:03.485 --> 01:42:05.320
it's not what I expected.

01:42:07.689 --> 01:42:09.424
Well what did you expect?

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:19.534
You remember...

01:42:21.836 --> 01:42:23.838
You remember the last time
I saw you?

01:42:30.312 --> 01:42:32.680
For a long time,
tried not to remember.

01:42:34.282 --> 01:42:36.384
Tried to forget all those times.

01:42:41.523 --> 01:42:42.857
Yeah.

01:42:44.459 --> 01:42:46.428
When we got to Atlanta...

01:42:47.429 --> 01:42:49.406
I started over.

01:42:49.531 --> 01:42:51.941
Built myself from the ground up.

01:42:52.066 --> 01:42:53.701
Built myself hard.

01:43:00.242 --> 01:43:02.910
- What about you? You...
- Me?

01:43:07.615 --> 01:43:09.817
I wasn't never really
worth shit.

01:43:11.719 --> 01:43:13.755
Just kept on, man.

01:43:16.658 --> 01:43:19.494
Never really did anything
I actually wanted to do.

01:43:20.995 --> 01:43:24.907
It was all I could do was to do what folks
thought I should be doing.

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.901
I wasn't never really myself.

01:43:29.871 --> 01:43:31.181
And now?

01:43:31.306 --> 01:43:32.740
Now?

01:43:35.577 --> 01:43:40.157
Now, man... now I got li'l Kev.

01:43:40.282 --> 01:43:42.049
Got this job.

01:43:42.784 --> 01:43:44.952
Another 18 months of probation.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:47.830
That's some real shit, man.

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:50.592
Nah, man.
It's a life.

01:43:51.293 --> 01:43:52.660
You know?

01:43:53.428 --> 01:43:55.838
I ain't never had that before.

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:57.465

01:43:58.466 --> 01:44:00.177

01:44:00.302 --> 01:44:03.271

than shoe money, but...

01:44:04.706 --> 01:44:07.049
I ain't got no worries, man.

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:09.477
Not them kind what I had before.

01:44:10.612 --> 01:44:12.347
That's that real shit.

01:44:13.781 --> 01:44:15.950
That's that Bob Marley shit,
nigga.

01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:36.203
You the only man
that's ever touched me.

01:44:45.179 --> 01:44:46.848
You're the only one.

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.757
I haven't really
touched anyone, since.
