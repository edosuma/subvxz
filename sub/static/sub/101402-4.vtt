01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
[exhales]

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
[cell phone vibrates]

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Here you go, sunshine.

01:47.000 --> 01:47.980
[exhales]

01:48.020 --> 01:50.000
I'm all ears.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Okay, first,

01:53.000 --> 01:53.508
I need to know that

01:53.548 --> 01:53.980
me and my brother

01:54.020 --> 01:54.700
won't get in any trouble,

01:54.740 --> 01:54.980
all right?

01:55.020 --> 01:56.054
He's a bit of a dickhead

01:56.094 --> 01:56.980
but he's my dickhead,

01:57.020 --> 01:58.460
do you know what I mean?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
[clears throat]

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Hey, Thompson.

02:08.000 --> 02:08.958
Can I get one of those

02:08.998 --> 02:10.378
immunity forms, please?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Excuse me, sir?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
The, um, code 274 document.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.980
Oh, an immunity form?

02:20.020 --> 02:21.980
[Brooks] That's the badger.

02:22.020 --> 02:22.980
So...

02:23.020 --> 02:24.485
Rest assured you

02:24.525 --> 02:25.980
and your brother

02:26.020 --> 02:26.980
will receive full immunity

02:27.020 --> 02:28.018
if you provide me

02:28.058 --> 02:28.980
with information

02:29.020 --> 02:29.390
that leads to

02:29.430 --> 02:30.570
the real criminals.

02:36.000 --> 02:36.980
Okay. Cool.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.980
Because we had no idea

02:39.020 --> 02:39.538
what the hell she was

02:39.578 --> 02:39.980
going to do, bro.

02:40.020 --> 02:40.722
-"She"?

02:40.762 --> 02:41.980
-Yeah, yeah.

02:42.020 --> 02:42.867
This girl, man,

02:42.907 --> 02:43.980
and her mental mum.

02:44.020 --> 02:45.456
But they're not psychos,

02:45.496 --> 02:46.980
they just wanted revenge.

02:47.020 --> 02:47.910
-Revenge, you think?

02:47.950 --> 02:49.330
-That's what they said.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.253
So, how old is this girl,

02:52.293 --> 02:53.000
exactly?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.402
I ain't saying another word

02:58.442 --> 03:00.242
till I get my immunity, innit?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Isn't it.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
d

03:08.000 --> 03:08.980
[Tina] There you are.

03:09.020 --> 03:09.980
Come on. Pack your stuff.

03:10.020 --> 03:11.430
I want to get back to the cabin

03:11.470 --> 03:12.190
before dark.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.980
I thought we agreed about this.

03:16.020 --> 03:17.980
I know... I just thought,

03:18.020 --> 03:18.665
maybe if I could have

03:18.705 --> 03:18.980
one day...

03:19.020 --> 03:20.980
You know what annoys me?

03:21.020 --> 03:21.517
Is if we'd killed

03:21.557 --> 03:22.457
Jimmy together,

03:23.000 --> 03:23.544
none of this would

03:23.584 --> 03:23.980
have happened.

03:24.020 --> 03:24.980
God, Mum, it was my revenge.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.039
I could do whatever

03:26.079 --> 03:26.980
I wanted with it.

03:27.020 --> 03:28.517
Yes, I know, I just think

03:28.557 --> 03:29.980
it might have been nice.

03:30.020 --> 03:30.700
We could have made a trip

03:30.740 --> 03:31.340
out of it.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Who's Jo?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.331
When he was dying,

03:41.371 --> 03:43.000
Jimmy said, "Tell Jo."

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Mum?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
d

03:49.000 --> 03:50.537
[Nicky] I didn't know whether

03:50.577 --> 03:51.980
you wanted toast or cereal,

03:52.020 --> 03:52.980
so I made both.

03:53.020 --> 03:54.980
Let's give it up for the man

03:55.020 --> 03:55.665
who knows how to work

03:55.705 --> 03:55.980
a toaster.

03:56.020 --> 03:57.081
[Kim] Looks nice,

03:57.121 --> 03:57.980
thanks, Nicky.

03:58.020 --> 03:58.910
[Nicky] There's also

03:58.950 --> 03:59.980
a selection of spreads.

04:00.020 --> 04:00.609
So, whatever tickles

04:00.649 --> 04:00.980
your pickle.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.378
This is exactly what

04:02.418 --> 04:03.980
I'm talking about, Kim.

04:04.020 --> 04:05.195
Toast that comes out

04:05.235 --> 04:05.980
of a machine.

04:06.020 --> 04:07.980
A single portion of jam

04:08.020 --> 04:08.980
wrapped in so much plastic

04:09.020 --> 04:09.980
it could kill a small whale.

04:10.020 --> 04:12.000
Oh, and this...

04:14.000 --> 04:15.980
Save water, drink Prosecco.

04:16.020 --> 04:16.685
What the fuck does this

04:16.725 --> 04:16.980
even mean?

04:17.020 --> 04:18.165
Back at home everything

04:18.205 --> 04:19.165
means something.

04:20.000 --> 04:20.980
I mean, what were you hoping

04:21.020 --> 04:21.980
to achieve with all of this?

04:22.020 --> 04:24.000
This, Mum! My list!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.440
All the things you've never

04:26.480 --> 04:26.980
let me do.

04:27.020 --> 04:28.143
Killing Jimmy was only

04:28.183 --> 04:28.980
one thing on it.

04:29.020 --> 04:29.670
I'm not even sure I would have

04:29.710 --> 04:29.980
even done that

04:30.020 --> 04:31.760
if it wasn't for the whole...

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Again, I'm so sorry about that.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Okay, how about this?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.980
You pick one thing at random,

04:41.020 --> 04:42.000
we go and do it

04:43.000 --> 04:43.980
and then we go home.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.000
Deal?

04:46.000 --> 04:46.980
What, like anything?

04:47.020 --> 04:49.000
Yeah, from your book. Go on.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
[exhales]

04:57.000 --> 04:57.980
What is it?

04:58.020 --> 04:59.336
I have to spend the day

04:59.376 --> 04:59.980
with Dad...

05:00.020 --> 05:01.000
at the fair.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.033
Because that's my last

05:03.073 --> 05:03.980
happy memory of him.

05:04.020 --> 05:06.980
[sighs] A whole day?

05:07.020 --> 05:08.677
I thought you might have picked

05:08.717 --> 05:09.980
something a bit smaller.

05:10.020 --> 05:11.187
How much pollution medicine

05:11.227 --> 05:11.980
have you got left?

05:12.020 --> 05:13.980
I'm sorry, can I just--

05:14.020 --> 05:16.000
Okay, okay. Just forget it.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.980
[screaming]

05:23.020 --> 05:25.000
[laughing]

05:27.000 --> 05:28.980
Isn't this fun?

05:29.020 --> 05:30.000
Yeah!

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
This is the best day ever!

05:40.000 --> 05:41.980
And then it was like...

05:42.020 --> 05:43.980
Arrow right in the chest, like,

05:44.020 --> 05:45.043
some kind of

05:45.083 --> 05:47.000
Katniss Everdeen shit.

05:48.000 --> 05:48.448
It was actually

05:48.488 --> 05:48.980
quite impressive.

05:49.020 --> 05:52.000
But Tina is quite like that.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.569
But bro, I thought you said

05:55.609 --> 05:57.049
that this was a 274 doc?

05:58.000 --> 05:58.980
This here says 374.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.980
[Brooks] So, this Tina woman,

06:01.020 --> 06:01.394
she's got, like,

06:01.434 --> 06:01.980
a crazed look about her

06:02.020 --> 06:03.485
which is at once

06:03.525 --> 06:04.980
both terrifying,

06:05.020 --> 06:05.980
yet oddly alluring?

06:06.020 --> 06:07.000
Yes!

06:08.000 --> 06:09.677
But she only killed Ian because

06:09.717 --> 06:11.157
he was going to kill us.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.641
-It was self-defense, really.

06:13.681 --> 06:14.181
-Sure.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.740
Take anything from the house?

06:18.000 --> 06:18.980
Like what?

06:19.020 --> 06:22.319
I don't know, valuables,

06:22.359 --> 06:24.000
money maybe?

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
Nope... No, no, uh, money.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
[coughing]

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Give us a sec.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.146
Shouldn't I get, like, a copy

06:40.186 --> 06:41.446
of that or something?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.089
So, apparently, Ian didn't

06:51.129 --> 06:52.000
kill Jimmy.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.711
I did think at the time,

06:54.751 --> 06:54.980
actually,

06:55.020 --> 06:56.414
that his wife was telling

06:56.454 --> 06:56.980
the truth.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.317
So why the fuck didn't you

06:58.357 --> 06:58.980
say something

06:59.020 --> 07:00.580
before we killed her then?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.260
It looked like you had it

07:02.300 --> 07:02.980
under control.

07:03.020 --> 07:03.493
Yeah, well, I did have it

07:03.533 --> 07:03.980
under control, actually.

07:04.020 --> 07:04.989
I was just a bit

07:05.029 --> 07:05.980
discombobulated,

07:06.020 --> 07:07.040
what with your little chat with

07:07.080 --> 07:07.980
your new best friend, Terri,

07:08.020 --> 07:09.100
before we went in.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.712
Shit, we killed that hiker

07:14.752 --> 07:16.000
as well, didn't we?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Oh, yeah.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.320
[cell phone vibrating]

07:22.000 --> 07:22.647
-It's Terri.

07:22.687 --> 07:23.187
-Shit.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.231
Just tell her we made a mistake

07:26.271 --> 07:28.000
and we'll get it sorted.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
What a pen-arse.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
[cell phone vibrating]

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Terri.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
[Kim whooping]

07:43.000 --> 07:43.980
Creep.

07:44.020 --> 07:44.736
I'm just trying to give her

07:44.776 --> 07:45.316
something

07:46.000 --> 07:46.980
to remember this day by.

07:47.020 --> 07:48.635
Please, I know exactly

07:48.675 --> 07:49.980
what you're up to.

07:50.020 --> 07:50.902
I'm trying to be

07:50.942 --> 07:51.980
a friend, actually.

07:52.020 --> 07:52.980
d

07:53.020 --> 07:54.980
Oh, my God, that's worse.

07:55.020 --> 07:55.434
I'm not scared

07:55.474 --> 07:56.494
of you, you know?

07:58.000 --> 07:58.980
Okay, I'm a bit scared of you.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.341
You can tell her I lied

08:00.381 --> 08:01.980
about the pills if you want.

08:02.020 --> 08:03.379
Shatter her perceptions

08:03.419 --> 08:03.980
of reality

08:04.020 --> 08:04.849
on the same day that

08:04.889 --> 08:05.980
she's remembering her dad,

08:06.020 --> 08:06.371
if you think

08:06.411 --> 08:07.551
that's a good idea.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.317
Don't you think instead of

08:11.357 --> 08:11.980
lying to her,

08:12.020 --> 08:12.741
you should just let her live

08:12.781 --> 08:12.980
a little?

08:13.020 --> 08:14.980
Look, no hands! Yeah!

08:15.020 --> 08:16.860
Or are you really just worried

08:16.900 --> 08:18.000
about being alone?

08:22.000 --> 08:22.623
Sorry, I didn't mean

08:22.663 --> 08:22.980
to be rude.

08:23.020 --> 08:24.456
I just think you might be

08:24.496 --> 08:25.036
surprised

08:26.000 --> 08:27.800
by how fine she'd be out here.

08:33.000 --> 08:33.980
[Kim] Look!

08:34.020 --> 08:35.360
-[thudding]

08:35.400 --> 08:35.980
-Kim!

08:36.020 --> 08:37.980
[Kim] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

08:38.020 --> 08:40.000
[Tina] You're bleeding.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.980
Oh no, don't worry,

08:43.020 --> 08:44.092
this is from a knife fight

08:44.132 --> 08:44.980
a couple of days ago.

08:45.020 --> 08:45.810
-[Nicky] What?

08:45.850 --> 08:46.980
-Oh no, don't worry.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.378
The guy who did it is dead now

08:48.418 --> 08:48.980
anyway, so...

08:49.020 --> 08:49.634
She's delirious, from losing

08:49.674 --> 08:49.980
all that blood.

08:50.020 --> 08:52.000
Nothing to worry about.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.507
[Nicky] We need to get

08:54.547 --> 08:54.980
her out of here now.

08:55.020 --> 08:56.980
Yeah, back home.

08:57.020 --> 08:57.980
[Nicky] Lethal, that ride,

08:58.020 --> 08:59.520
look how fast it's going.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.482
[Tina] Your dad would be

09:09.522 --> 09:09.980
so proud

09:10.020 --> 09:10.980
of the woman you've become.

09:11.020 --> 09:13.980
Independent, resilient.

09:14.020 --> 09:14.716
I mean, you're basically

09:14.756 --> 09:14.980
a badass,

09:15.020 --> 09:16.980
which is super inspiring.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.562
Do you remember when I ran away

09:18.602 --> 09:19.980
from the cabin when I was 12

09:20.020 --> 09:21.261
and you tracked me down

09:21.301 --> 09:21.980
in the forest

09:22.020 --> 09:22.980
and shot me with a tranquilizer

09:23.020 --> 09:24.083
because I was about to cross

09:24.123 --> 09:25.503
the border into Russia?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.531
I'd heard rumors

09:28.571 --> 09:29.980
of an invasion.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.580
I couldn't take any risks.

-So you weren't lying then?

09:33.778 --> 09:35.000
-No! Of course not!

09:37.000 --> 09:38.647
I was wrong, as it turned out,

09:38.687 --> 09:40.127
but, no, I wasn't lying.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.057

09:42.097 --> 09:43.237
I need to tell you.

-Well, the thing is...

Ow! Mum!

09:49.020 --> 09:50.127
-Sit still then.

09:50.167 --> 09:52.000
-[Kim] I am sitting still.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.389
-What is it, Nicky?

09:54.429 --> 09:55.000
-Well...

09:56.000 --> 09:56.947
Oh, gosh, that's

09:56.987 --> 09:57.980

09:58.020 --> 09:59.165
Are you hot? Is it hot?

09:59.205 --> 10:00.165
It's really hot.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.980
Are you okay?

10:02.020 --> 10:04.041

There we go. All done.

10:15.020 --> 10:16.320
Thanks. I'll just go and see

10:18.000 --> 10:19.980
Oh, yeah! I'll come with you.

10:20.020 --> 10:20.946
We could do with some food

10:20.986 --> 10:22.666

10:52.000 --> 10:53.744
I've just never seen

10:53.784 --> 10:55.000
so much stuff.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.336
I don't even understand

10:58.376 --> 10:58.980
half of it.

Fish don't even have fingers!

How do you ever choose

11:15.855 --> 11:16.980

11:17.020 --> 11:18.184
How do you make space

11:18.224 --> 11:18.980

11:19.020 --> 11:19.980
I know, it's depressing.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.000
No, I mean, literally how?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.344
My mum never told me

11:24.384 --> 11:25.980
about any of this stuff.

11:26.020 --> 11:28.000
Yeah, about that...

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
What? What is it?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh, God, I've missed you.

11:47.000 --> 11:47.905
Your mum lies to you

11:47.945 --> 11:48.980
about everything, okay?

There's no fish measles

11:50.633 --> 11:52.000
or killer pollution.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.266
Okay, so she bent the truth

11:54.306 --> 11:54.980
on a few things

11:55.020 --> 11:55.578
but she's hardly going to

11:55.618 --> 11:55.980
make up something

11:56.020 --> 11:57.160
as serious as that.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.980
I mean, why would she?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.075
To keep me trapped

12:01.115 --> 12:01.980

Well, then don't you think

I'm being a little dramatic?

12:19.020 --> 12:19.432
Sorry, do I think

12:19.472 --> 12:19.980
you're being dramatic

Yep, okay, bye.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Doughnut?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.420
You know I don't do carbs.

21:14.460 --> 21:15.000
Idiot.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Right.

21:19.000 --> 21:19.980
That was Terri on the phone.

21:20.020 --> 21:20.933
She says we've got

21:20.973 --> 21:22.173
two days to deliver.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Or what?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.980
What the fuck?

21:30.020 --> 21:31.013
Sorry, I was trying

21:31.053 --> 21:32.133
to offer a visual.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.080
Well, clean it up!

21:40.000 --> 21:40.619
[Brooks] What did Terri

21:40.659 --> 21:41.439
actually say?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.156
She said we've got

21:43.196 --> 21:44.980
two days to deliver or else.

21:45.020 --> 21:45.980
"Or else."

21:46.020 --> 21:48.176
She actually used the words

21:48.216 --> 21:48.980
"Or else."

21:49.020 --> 21:50.980
Yeah.

21:51.020 --> 21:52.980
Jesus Christ.

21:53.020 --> 21:53.907
That's the trouble

21:53.947 --> 21:54.980
with you millennials.

21:55.020 --> 21:57.000
No originality.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.320
Tracker's on the move.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
[engine revving]

22:18.000 --> 22:18.508
Maybe it's a secret

22:18.548 --> 22:19.568
message from Dad.

22:20.000 --> 22:20.637
Or, no, maybe he made

22:20.677 --> 22:20.980
films of us

22:21.020 --> 22:22.980
when I was a little kid!

22:23.020 --> 22:23.980
Maybe he...

22:24.020 --> 22:26.000
[music playing]

22:32.000 --> 22:32.980
[Tina] So this is cricket.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.111
I'm sorry. How did you

22:34.151 --> 22:34.980
get in the house?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.049
It was your dad's

22:36.089 --> 22:36.980
favorite sport.

22:37.020 --> 22:37.827
No, seriously, though,

22:37.867 --> 22:38.980
did you have a spare key or...

22:39.020 --> 22:40.000
Not now, fucko.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.077
We left the night

22:45.117 --> 22:45.980
your dad died.

22:46.020 --> 22:46.980
We had to.

22:47.020 --> 22:48.334
But when we stopped at

22:48.374 --> 22:49.980
a service station for food,

22:50.020 --> 22:52.176
I saw this DVD on the shelf

22:52.216 --> 22:53.000
and, um...

22:54.000 --> 22:55.330
I broke down, right there

22:55.370 --> 22:56.090
in the shop.

22:57.000 --> 22:57.980
Because,

22:58.020 --> 22:59.980
well, this particular match

23:00.020 --> 23:01.986
in this particular sport

23:02.026 --> 23:03.000
is called...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
The Ashes.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.980
And your dad loved it

23:11.020 --> 23:12.460
more than anything else.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I know it isn't perfect

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
but it was the best I could do.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
[sighs] I'm really sorry.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
The thing is, Mum...

23:29.000 --> 23:30.572
I have no idea what's true

23:30.612 --> 23:32.000
and what's not anymore.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
All you've done is lie to me.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.980
And some of it

23:38.020 --> 23:38.980
I can understand,

23:39.020 --> 23:40.582
but I have been speaking

23:40.622 --> 23:41.980
to a piece of plastic

23:42.020 --> 23:42.980
my whole life,

23:43.020 --> 23:45.000
thinking that it's my dad.

23:47.000 --> 23:47.888
How do you expect me

23:47.928 --> 23:49.368
to forgive you for that?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
d

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
[Jay] Right.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
So, listen...

24:04.000 --> 24:05.980
The thing is...

24:06.020 --> 24:07.378
I think I might have fucked up

24:07.418 --> 24:08.198
a little bit.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.140
What have you done?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.980
Jay, what the fuck?

24:23.020 --> 24:23.501
Who did you speak to?

24:23.541 --> 24:23.980
What was their name?

24:24.020 --> 24:26.141
-D.I. Brooks I think.

24:26.181 --> 24:27.980
-Oh, he's crooked.

24:28.020 --> 24:28.980
He's one of Jimmy's inside men.

24:29.020 --> 24:29.980
How do you know that?

24:30.020 --> 24:31.195
He's one of the cops

24:31.235 --> 24:31.980
who let Jimmy

24:32.020 --> 24:32.404
get away with

24:32.444 --> 24:33.524
your dad's murder.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.980
And if he gets half a chance,

24:35.020 --> 24:35.955
he'll kill every

24:35.995 --> 24:37.015
single one of us.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.980
And you've led him right to us.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.000
Good one, Jay.

24:42.000 --> 24:42.980
Okay then. So, let's go.

24:43.020 --> 24:45.000
