00:00.620 --> 00:01.370
Carl?

00:01.777 --> 00:03.256
I heard about the young woman.

00:03.416 --> 00:05.091
Were you able to correct her condition?

00:05.251 --> 00:06.301
Do you know her?

00:06.811 --> 00:08.889
I'd like to be kept up-to-date
on her progress.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.430
Yeah, you and who else?

00:10.590 --> 00:12.474
When did you start working for Roth?

00:16.532 --> 00:17.979
Take your hand off me.

00:18.375 --> 00:20.990
If humans follow the same timeline
as the monkeys,

00:21.110 --> 00:22.692
in a week, possibly two,

00:22.853 --> 00:25.334
Nina may begin to experience
the same violent tendencies.

00:25.454 --> 00:28.216
We need to destroy the stem cells
that activated Nina's Jacobson's organ.

00:28.336 --> 00:31.137
Pressurized oxygen
gets into Bob's brain,

00:31.257 --> 00:32.744
could cause oxidative stress,

00:32.904 --> 00:35.121
that could make the Herpes virus
pop out of the DNA.

00:35.281 --> 00:36.831
We can kill it with the antivirals.

00:36.991 --> 00:37.991
It's gone.

00:39.536 --> 00:40.536
I'm sorry.

00:40.870 --> 00:42.671
Nina's three months pregnant.

00:44.623 --> 00:47.008
When I was a kid, I got sick.

00:48.038 --> 00:48.885
David,

00:49.046 --> 00:50.387
what happened to me...

00:50.961 --> 00:52.011
the baby...

00:53.085 --> 00:54.435
It can't be mine.

01:02.717 --> 01:05.967
When I was nine,
they thought I had testicular cancer.

01:07.129 --> 01:09.229
But what I really had was cysts.

01:10.516 --> 01:12.616
- Okay...
- During the surgery,

01:13.470 --> 01:15.920
they figured out that it wasn't cancer.

01:16.483 --> 01:18.433
But there were complications.

01:18.994 --> 01:19.894
How bad?

01:20.256 --> 01:22.838
My semen contains very few sperm.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.530
I never knew how few
until Dr. Bruen checked.

01:27.846 --> 01:29.134
What was the count?

01:30.362 --> 01:31.112
Zero.

01:32.666 --> 01:34.316
I'm completely sterile.

01:36.409 --> 01:37.684
I'm sorry, Bob.

01:40.083 --> 01:40.983
David...

01:43.782 --> 01:46.232
This pregnancy is very, very confusing.

01:47.129 --> 01:47.879
Here.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.743
Thank you.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.212
You're welcome.

01:52.332 --> 01:53.482
Look, it's...

01:54.663 --> 01:57.163
It's really not that big a mystery, Bob.

01:58.088 --> 02:00.938
I mean, you were gone a long time
and maybe...

02:01.200 --> 02:04.711
Nina probably thought she was never
gonna see you again, she got lonely.

02:05.052 --> 02:07.881
- Along comes another guy...
- She would never cheat on me, David.

02:10.370 --> 02:11.470
Okay then...

02:11.765 --> 02:13.765
Maybe somebody made a mistake.

02:13.885 --> 02:14.971
That happens.

02:15.268 --> 02:18.297
We'll get Carlos to get a genetic sample
of the fetus from Dr. Bruen.

02:18.417 --> 02:20.211
We'll compare it to your DNA.

02:20.547 --> 02:22.745
Find out for sure if you're the father.

02:23.804 --> 02:25.302
The baby is mine.

02:27.692 --> 02:28.942
Of course, Bob.

Did you get the test results
for the CDC back yet?

02:45.454 --> 02:48.505
- Oh, sorry.
- Do you remember my friend Jack Bowden?

02:48.666 --> 02:50.403
- Africa, right?
<i>- That's right.</i>

02:50.523 --> 02:52.509
<i>David, greetings from Moldova.</i>

02:52.669 --> 02:55.586
- You're kidding.
- WHO was called in on a mystery illness

02:55.706 --> 02:58.440
- in a city called Birku.
- Over 200 dead.

02:58.842 --> 03:01.592
They sent me
with a team of 4 doctors but...

03:01.854 --> 03:04.354
- we're getting absolutely nowhere.
- Symptoms?

03:04.515 --> 03:07.202
Healthy people are suddenly
bleeding from their mouth and

03:07.322 --> 03:09.901
<i>their nose. They're feverish,</i>

03:10.062 --> 03:11.945
<i>having difficulty breathing, then come</i>

03:12.106 --> 03:15.147
<i>convulsions, paralysis, coma and death.</i>

03:15.267 --> 03:16.367
How quickly?

03:16.812 --> 03:17.812
<i>Couple of days.</i>

03:18.186 --> 03:19.494
Jesus. Any guesses?

03:19.655 --> 03:21.791
<i>We've been going round in circles
on this one.</i>

03:21.911 --> 03:25.162
<i>Now we're wondering if the equipment
and lab techs here are so substandard.</i>

03:25.282 --> 03:27.043
<i>And you guys are the best.</i>

03:27.203 --> 03:28.703
Riddlemeyer would have an aneurysm

03:28.823 --> 03:30.797
if he caught us
working outside our jurisdiction.

03:31.662 --> 03:32.892
He'll be fine with it.

03:33.012 --> 03:35.969
Everyone wants to keep Moldova
away from Russia, so...

03:36.130 --> 03:37.926
<i>Got to show them
we can help our friends.</i>

03:38.046 --> 03:40.974
Okay, send us samples. Blood, urine,
all you got, we'll see what we can do.

03:41.261 --> 03:43.832
That would be great, David.
Carlos, take care of yourself, okay?

03:43.952 --> 03:45.728
- Alright. Bye, Jack.
<i>- Thanks, guys.</i>

03:46.516 --> 03:48.716
- Thank you, David.
- No problem.

03:49.374 --> 03:51.174
Any news? Am I the father?

03:51.730 --> 03:53.630
We'll get results soon, Bob.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.558
Come on, Bob.
Let's give Carlos some space.

03:56.678 --> 03:57.578
Come on.

04:05.001 --> 04:06.583
- You okay?
- Sure.

04:08.342 --> 04:09.092
Sure.

04:12.694 --> 04:14.239
It's taking him long time.

04:14.359 --> 04:17.343
- He's just being thorough.
- It's just a routine test!

04:17.504 --> 04:19.764
Nothing is routine for Carlos.

04:25.636 --> 04:27.270
So, am I the father?

04:27.593 --> 04:29.693
More complicated than that, Bob.

04:32.537 --> 04:34.444
- What I'm trying to say is...
- Just say it.

04:36.683 --> 04:37.906
Your baby's a clone.

04:39.801 --> 04:40.909
Say again.

04:41.069 --> 04:42.368
A clone of you, Bob.

Guthrie BioLab
do more paternity tests

06:23.332 --> 06:25.841
than anyone else in Canada.
They got the same results I did.

06:25.961 --> 06:27.331
I don't believe this.

06:27.451 --> 06:30.338
A team in Oregon was successful
cloning primate cells.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.974
But they implanted 100 embryos
into 50 macaque monkeys,

06:33.094 --> 06:35.462
- they didn't get one birth.
- David, you've always said

06:35.582 --> 06:38.205
whoever succeeded at human cloning
would do it under the radar.

06:38.325 --> 06:40.971
Under the radar,
not right under our noses.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.096
There's only one person
who could have done this.

06:55.929 --> 06:57.079
Olivier Roth.

07:04.777 --> 07:07.077
- I have to go now.
- Are you okay?

07:07.391 --> 07:08.091
Bob?

07:08.936 --> 07:10.236
I need some air.

07:13.897 --> 07:14.847
Hey, Bob.

07:18.789 --> 07:20.193
What's wrong with Bob?

07:20.772 --> 07:22.245
We need to find Roth.

07:22.365 --> 07:24.794
I've been in touch
with all the US Intelligence agencies.

07:24.914 --> 07:27.062
Three words: Osama Bin Laden.

07:27.374 --> 07:29.024
I want you to find him.

07:29.429 --> 07:30.245
Sure.

07:31.267 --> 07:33.417
Can I take off my coat off first?

07:49.827 --> 07:50.577
Nina?

07:51.913 --> 07:52.863
You home?

08:01.057 --> 08:02.617
Hey, here you are...

08:06.833 --> 08:09.700
I went to the hospital, why didn't you
call me? I would have picked you up.

08:22.684 --> 08:23.756
It's gone.

08:26.628 --> 08:28.386
My Jacobson's Organ.

08:29.886 --> 08:32.056
But that's what we wanted.

08:32.770 --> 08:34.974
But you can't have
a functioning Jacobson's organ

08:35.094 --> 08:36.530
and your sanity.

08:37.085 --> 08:37.985
You did.

08:39.081 --> 08:40.649
My Asperger's somehow...

08:40.769 --> 08:42.081
It filtered...

08:43.852 --> 08:44.931
I don't know...

08:45.051 --> 08:47.445
The monkeys couldn't, you couldn't...

08:47.565 --> 08:50.126
Anyway, I don't have it now either.

08:51.217 --> 08:52.618
Don't you miss it?

08:55.824 --> 08:56.574
Yeah.

08:57.472 --> 08:59.792
All my life, I've felt isolated.

09:01.295 --> 09:05.293
Well Asperger's,
by definition, is isolation.

09:05.413 --> 09:07.057
Then you know the feeling

09:07.177 --> 09:10.752
of finally realizing
people are communicating all the time.

09:11.190 --> 09:13.240
There's this whole conversation

09:13.586 --> 09:15.058
of pure emotion.

09:16.194 --> 09:17.810
And I was in on it.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.522
For the first time,
I understood other people.

09:23.069 --> 09:24.442
And now it's gone.

09:26.419 --> 09:28.784
- Our son will have it.
- Genetically that's not...

09:28.904 --> 09:30.865
Our son will have it because...

09:32.934 --> 09:33.786
Our son

09:34.457 --> 09:36.413
is my clone.

09:38.537 --> 09:39.373
Clone?

09:41.421 --> 09:42.171
When?

09:43.301 --> 09:44.170
How?!

09:44.330 --> 09:47.930
Roth must've done it
when he activated your Jacobson's organ.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.558
Nina, did you know anything about this?

09:50.678 --> 09:53.763
No. Of course not.
If I did, I would have told you.

09:58.886 --> 10:01.312
I knew you wouldn't be involved
in something like this.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.694
Will our baby be okay?

10:03.814 --> 10:07.647
- There's so much that can go wrong...
- I promise I will do everything I can.

10:12.309 --> 10:14.509
I never thought I'd have a baby...

10:15.541 --> 10:17.441
I was hoping you'd say that.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.065
Hey Carlos.

10:33.495 --> 10:35.894
- What's all that?
- Samples from Moldova.

10:36.674 --> 10:37.870
Where's David?

10:38.104 --> 10:39.837
I think he's in his office.

10:39.957 --> 10:41.245
Are you okay, Bob?

10:51.092 --> 10:52.381
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:53.318 --> 10:54.699
I got your message.

10:54.959 --> 10:56.342
Yeah, come on in.

10:57.654 --> 10:59.576
How you doing? How's Nina?

11:01.100 --> 11:02.136
She's good.

11:02.592 --> 11:03.791
Everything's alright.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.441
Good.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.759
Bob we have to talk about...

11:16.654 --> 11:18.472
We have to talk about your clone.

11:19.159 --> 11:20.433
You mean my son.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.146
No, I mean your clone, Bob.

11:26.414 --> 11:27.273
Come on.

11:27.433 --> 11:30.951
A son is where two people mix their DNA
and create something genetically unique,

11:31.071 --> 11:33.321
to evolve the species.
A clone is static.

11:33.697 --> 11:36.449
No. He'll have
his Jacobson's organ awakened.

11:37.540 --> 11:38.701
It's evolution, David.

11:38.861 --> 11:41.787
Radical, but it's still
quintessentially Darwinian.

11:41.947 --> 11:45.291
The first human clone.
A million mistakes could've been made.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.793
- Except Roth's team got it right.
- Yeah,

11:48.111 --> 11:50.046
he and his team
have a great track record.

11:50.675 --> 11:52.418
All the tests on the baby are normal.

11:52.538 --> 11:54.748
Do you want a list
of the things that can go wrong

11:54.868 --> 11:58.346
- for which there is no test?
- You have to have faith, David.

11:58.781 --> 12:01.181
- Faith in science.
- "Faith in science"?

12:02.259 --> 12:04.691
Science has nothing to do with faith.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.416
Science is about facts.

12:06.536 --> 12:09.865
Okay, so, fact:
clones are more prone to disease.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.393
Fact: it's been shown
that clones have tendency to age faster.

12:13.513 --> 12:16.072
So even if he's healthy,
he could just end up dying young.

12:16.232 --> 12:17.421
Bottom line is...

12:18.065 --> 12:20.850
what's in Nina is nothing more than a...

12:21.389 --> 12:24.366
spin the wheel,
freak show, science experiment.

12:25.022 --> 12:28.092
Don't do this to yourself.
Don't do this to Nina.

12:31.386 --> 12:33.589
You have to consider termination.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.593
Nina and I have already discussed it.

12:42.198 --> 12:44.469
And what Mr. Roth did
was a horrible thing.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.503
Not asking us was inexcusable.

12:46.623 --> 12:49.616
But to improve the species permanently,

12:50.273 --> 12:53.905
he needed to do this.
So in a funny way, I thank him.

12:54.361 --> 12:56.390
For impregnating your girlfriend?

12:56.510 --> 12:59.073
Most guys would be
a little pissed off at that!

13:01.096 --> 13:03.580
Did Nina really have no idea about this?

13:04.061 --> 13:06.914
So Roth just... what?
He knocked her out and knocked her up?

13:07.585 --> 13:10.257
There's a word for that, Bob,
you think about it.

13:13.046 --> 13:16.132
- I promised Nina I'd be right home.
- I want to talk to her.

13:17.288 --> 13:19.884
Why don't the two of you
come over for dinner tonight?

13:20.004 --> 13:23.973
- No, she doesn't want to talk about it.
- I just want to ask her some questions.

13:25.623 --> 13:26.983
Neither do I.

13:29.081 --> 13:29.988
Bob.

13:30.318 --> 13:31.987
David. I have something.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.235
Took you long enough.

13:38.124 --> 13:39.976
How's Bob handling things?

13:41.044 --> 13:43.727
Sometimes I think the human species
is genetically programmed

13:43.847 --> 13:45.748
to look at the bright side
of any disaster.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.344
You never met my grandmother.

13:47.932 --> 13:51.011
Okay, so Roth. I've discovered
that he has this corporate jet

13:51.131 --> 13:53.092
that he uses
to fly down to the Turks & Caicos.

13:53.212 --> 13:55.025
- He's got a place there?
- An island.

13:55.145 --> 13:56.720
- Is he there now?
- I don't know.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.757
- Well, Mayko.
- Okay, hold on second.

13:58.877 --> 14:01.879
Look. Whenever he comes or goes,
he has to file a flight plan

14:01.999 --> 14:04.453
- with customs and immigration.
- Good. Get that information.

14:04.573 --> 14:06.724
- I got that information.
- Is he there?

14:06.884 --> 14:09.518
It's more complicated than that.
Here, look at this.

14:10.908 --> 14:12.819
US satellite photos of the island.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.401
They're taken
every time KH-13 flies over.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.512
- K-what?
- Keyhole-13,

14:17.708 --> 14:21.308
- a spy satellite over Cuba.
- The US spies on Roth?

14:21.709 --> 14:22.849
Wouldn't you?

14:23.293 --> 14:25.784
Anyway, Turks & Caicos
are on the same trajectory

14:26.457 --> 14:28.412
as Cuba, so every time they pass over.

14:29.831 --> 14:32.480
US spies on the guy,
and Riddlemeyer can't find him.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.270
I knew that fucking vampire
was full of shit.

14:35.622 --> 14:37.649
Riddlemeyer works for Riddlemeyer.

14:37.769 --> 14:41.258
Okay, photos. Is he there?
'Cause I can be down there in 3 hours.

14:41.542 --> 14:42.928
 It's definitely his jet.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.804
It's going to take me another day
to confirm that's him beside it.

14:46.770 --> 14:47.708
Fuck...

14:54.905 --> 14:55.866
What?

14:56.546 --> 14:58.467
Lilith! Hey, how are you?

14:59.311 --> 15:00.671
Everything alright?

15:01.913 --> 15:03.272
That's amazing.

15:04.139 --> 15:07.819
What are you gonna study?
Molecular biology or molecular biology?

15:09.858 --> 15:12.788
Hang on, there's somebody at the door.
Come on in! The door's open.

15:12.908 --> 15:16.867
Listen, I want to talk to you more
about this. So, I'll call you back.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.448
I'm really proud of you.

15:22.159 --> 15:23.213
I love you.

15:28.276 --> 15:30.057
Nina. Where's...

15:30.901 --> 15:32.073
Where's Bob?

15:32.283 --> 15:33.464
He's at home.

15:34.908 --> 15:37.158
You're putting a lot of pressure on him.

15:37.533 --> 15:41.133
Well, a good friend asks
the tough questions nobody else will.

15:41.806 --> 15:44.313
A good friend respects
the answers he hears.

15:45.462 --> 15:47.687
Bob is trying to come to terms
with all of this.

15:47.807 --> 15:51.203
David, what he needs is your help.
And what we need is your support.

15:51.363 --> 15:53.372
- I'm the one carrying the baby.
- No, Nina,

15:53.532 --> 15:55.666
you're the one carrying the clone.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.754
Bob's clone that Roth put inside you.

15:59.012 --> 16:02.131
- I didn't know about the clone.
- Yeah? You and how many other women?

16:02.808 --> 16:05.360
What, you think
you're carrying the only clone?

16:05.480 --> 16:06.844
Here's what I think...

16:07.743 --> 16:11.720
I think after Roth realized
that his dream of spreading empathy

16:11.840 --> 16:15.681
by waking up people's Jacobson's organs
turned out to be a fucking nightmare,

16:16.009 --> 16:17.880
he gave up on it. Just dropped it.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.158
But not before coming up
with another plan.

16:20.278 --> 16:22.607
If he couldn't give us
empathy individually,

16:22.801 --> 16:25.189
he was gonna just change
the entire human species

16:25.309 --> 16:28.033
by breeding empathy into us
using Bob's clones.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.452
Why play street craps, when you can buy
the whole fucking casino, right?

16:31.951 --> 16:34.496
- How many women had this procedure?
- I don't know what he's done.

16:34.706 --> 16:37.927
- You haven't been in touch with him?
- Look, I don't know what Roth is up to.

16:38.047 --> 16:41.034
All I know is, I'm having a baby,
that's what I'm concerned about.

16:41.154 --> 16:43.232
I hope we never see Roth again!

16:43.438 --> 16:44.882
And if this keeps up,

16:45.369 --> 16:47.548
I'm gonna start hoping we don't see you.

17:10.617 --> 17:13.464
So, preliminary samples from Moldova
all came back negative.

17:13.585 --> 17:16.054
No signs of a known infectious agents:
viral or bacterial.

17:16.174 --> 17:18.073
- What's in the charts?
- Like Jack said,

17:18.193 --> 17:20.930
fever, difficulty breathing,
convulsions, paralysis.

17:21.050 --> 17:22.308
That could be anything.

17:22.428 --> 17:24.800
I checked for Japanese encephalitis,
diphtheria.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.303
- Poisonous plants? Spider bites?
- All negative.

17:27.423 --> 17:30.177
- Parasites?
- I tested for the ones I think of.

17:30.337 --> 17:32.595
Maybe something in the environment.
A poison?

17:32.775 --> 17:34.605
The mass spec didn't show anything.

17:34.725 --> 17:37.315
But the sudden onset of symptoms
would suggest it's viral.

17:37.435 --> 17:39.936
Jack said there was some bleeding,
maybe hemorrhagic fever?

17:40.056 --> 17:41.202
All negative.

17:42.182 --> 17:45.109
This is very difficult to do
10,000 kilometers away.

17:45.391 --> 17:46.680
No argument here.

17:47.688 --> 17:49.610
I'll see if I can't get us
some more data.

17:49.730 --> 17:50.571
Okay.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.907
- You get my message?
- Yeah, what's up?

17:55.027 --> 17:57.026
Okay, good news is,
Roth was on his island.

17:57.146 --> 18:00.024
Bad news is, he left it 24 hours ago
and landed in New York.

18:01.058 --> 18:02.722
That narrows it down.

18:03.097 --> 18:06.004
And here's the interesting thing.
Over the last three months

18:06.164 --> 18:08.698
he's had this revolving door
of people visiting him.

18:08.818 --> 18:11.601
- Like, five, ten at a time.
- Mostly women?

18:11.825 --> 18:12.971
No, mostly suits.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.619
I've identified
some predominantly politicians.

18:15.739 --> 18:16.906
Big shots, eh?

18:18.303 --> 18:19.809
So what are they up to?

18:19.929 --> 18:23.021
I don't know, David,
but I know who you can ask.

18:26.801 --> 18:27.710
Nina...

18:28.097 --> 18:29.368
Sure looks like her.

18:29.572 --> 18:30.387
Yeah.

18:31.092 --> 18:34.408
What about that flight plan Roth's got
to file with customs and immigration?

18:34.573 --> 18:36.723
- We know for sure?
- All the names are aliases,

18:36.843 --> 18:38.722
- we have to rely on the photos.
- Ah, shit...

18:38.842 --> 18:41.669
Now Roth's plane picks
people up in Miami, okay?

18:41.789 --> 18:43.050
Look at the date.

18:45.689 --> 18:46.726
It's the...

18:48.101 --> 18:50.318
It's the weekend that the terrorists...

18:52.477 --> 18:55.095
She told Bob she was going
to visit her father in Michigan.

18:55.339 --> 18:58.140
And I found her
on an Air Canada flight to Miami.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.550
And I'm pretty sure
the woman next to her is Sheila Woo.

19:01.671 --> 19:03.133
Why is that name familiar?

19:03.253 --> 19:06.819
She was on the team that did
the primate cloning in Oregon.

19:07.293 --> 19:10.197
Last night, Nina told me
she had no idea what Roth was up to.

19:10.317 --> 19:14.486
Here she is three a a half weeks ago,
next to a cloning expert in Miami.

19:14.606 --> 19:17.297
Find Woo,
ask her what the hell she's doing.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.261
David.

19:18.905 --> 19:19.737
What?

19:19.857 --> 19:21.111
It's important.

19:21.231 --> 19:22.652
Jack just sent this.

19:23.047 --> 19:25.581
<i>Carlos, David,
I wanted to thank you for helping.</i>

19:25.701 --> 19:28.629
<i>We finally figured it all out.
It's Japanese encephalitis.</i>

19:28.789 --> 19:31.844
<i>We've already started treatments
and are seeing results. So,</i>

19:32.264 --> 19:33.425
<i>thanks again, guys.</i>

19:34.353 --> 19:35.552
Okay, so what?

19:35.672 --> 19:38.925
It can't be Japanese encephalitis. First
of all, there's no treatment for it.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.391
And I tested for the virus.
It came back negative.

19:41.566 --> 19:44.523
- What are you telling me for, tell him.
- That's my point, David.

19:44.643 --> 19:46.214
Jack would know that.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.064
I think he's trying to send us
some kind of message.

19:49.184 --> 19:49.980
What?

19:50.220 --> 19:52.098
I don't know,
but he's not answering his phone.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.291
And no one's heard from him or any
of the other doctors in over 24 hours.

19:55.411 --> 19:56.981
What do you want to do?

19:57.611 --> 19:59.394
- I wanna go.
- To Moldova?!

20:00.106 --> 20:01.703
Something's not right here.

20:02.471 --> 20:04.289
I think Jack's in some kind of trouble.

20:05.855 --> 20:06.780
Make it quick!

20:07.495 --> 20:09.670
- And keep in touch!
- Thank you.

20:38.212 --> 20:38.965
Yes?

20:39.543 --> 20:40.284
Nina.

20:41.276 --> 20:42.578
Carlton Riddlemeyer.

20:43.104 --> 20:45.296
Perhaps Olivier Roth has mentioned me?

20:47.005 --> 20:49.042
I think it's best if you invite me in.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.431
Have you spoken to Olivier recently?

21:00.116 --> 21:00.816
No.

21:01.944 --> 21:03.626
Have you tried to call him?

21:04.215 --> 21:05.576
He's hard to reach.

21:07.273 --> 21:10.145
You're about to have
the world's first human clone,

21:10.265 --> 21:11.481
and he's hard to reach?

21:13.626 --> 21:16.486
Nina, you're going to be the most
controversial woman on this planet.

21:18.014 --> 21:20.198
Who's gonna be there to help you?
To protect you?

21:21.771 --> 21:23.201
Bob and I will be fine.

21:24.318 --> 21:25.018
Bob?

21:26.401 --> 21:28.540
You have absolutely no idea
what's coming, do you?

21:30.416 --> 21:32.592
The legal, ethical, political battles?

21:33.255 --> 21:34.588
I can help you, Nina.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.965
Mr. Roth is gonna do that.

21:39.605 --> 21:40.427
Is he?

21:41.668 --> 21:44.131
We should take a little trip
to see Mr. Roth.

21:44.674 --> 21:47.434
Afterwards, I think you might
just change your position.

21:53.791 --> 21:55.729
- I don't know...
- Bob.

21:56.854 --> 21:59.186
- It's a funny angle.
- It's her.

21:59.477 --> 22:00.419
Maybe.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.238
We have proof
that she flew from Toronto to Miami

22:03.358 --> 22:05.079
when she said
she was flying to Michigan,

22:05.199 --> 22:08.222
and we have proof that Roth's plane
flew to Miami the same day.

22:08.342 --> 22:10.041
Presumably to pick her up.

22:13.133 --> 22:15.073
Even if she met with Mr. Roth...

22:15.356 --> 22:16.056
So?

22:16.729 --> 22:19.257
So she lied to you, Bob.
What else has she been lying about?

22:19.417 --> 22:21.677
Maybe she knew she was
carrying your clone all along.

22:23.355 --> 22:26.898
All I ever wanted was to have a child
and never thought I could have one.

22:27.018 --> 22:29.970
This is the best thing ever.
And don't say it's not a real child.

22:30.090 --> 22:32.093
Fine, but we need to talk to her.

22:32.968 --> 22:34.672
She should tell us everything she knows.

22:34.792 --> 22:37.734
Yeah, she should bring us to Roth
so we can find out what he's up to.

22:37.894 --> 22:38.698
Right?

22:40.084 --> 22:40.784
Bob?

22:42.730 --> 22:44.461
I love her so much, David.

22:48.917 --> 22:49.781
Alright.

22:50.653 --> 22:53.080
We'll talk to her. But please...

22:53.429 --> 22:54.334
be civil.

22:57.165 --> 22:58.050
Please?

23:19.567 --> 23:22.012
Let me do the talking.
Sometimes you come on a bit strong.

23:22.132 --> 23:22.928
Fine.

23:26.757 --> 23:27.469
Nina?

23:29.440 --> 23:30.140
Nina?

23:36.009 --> 23:37.496
She's not here, David.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.458
This isn't like her.
She wouldn't just leave.

23:39.578 --> 23:41.792
Maybe she went out to buy some pickles.

23:43.133 --> 23:44.887
She's gone. She's gone.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.758
Don't panic.
Call her cell.

24:05.506 --> 24:07.362
She'd never leave without this.

24:07.912 --> 24:11.006
Unless she went somewhere
where she didn't wanna be reached.

25:19.366 --> 25:20.633
Dr. Serrano.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.441
- Emil Lupu.
- Thank you for seeing me, Sir.

25:23.601 --> 25:26.305
- How may I help you?
- Jack Bowden is an old friend of mine.

25:26.425 --> 25:29.569
He's asked NorBAC to assist
in a disease outbreak in Birku.

25:30.413 --> 25:33.137
News must travel slowly.
It's been solved.

25:33.257 --> 25:36.699
I heard. The thing is, I can't seem to
find Jack or any of the other doctors.

25:36.819 --> 25:39.087
They're not at the hotel,
have not returned home.

25:39.207 --> 25:41.143
No one seems to know where they are.

25:41.263 --> 25:43.313
On another project, perhaps?

25:43.755 --> 25:46.639
I was wondering
if perhaps they had returned to Birku?

25:47.191 --> 25:47.909
No.

25:48.366 --> 25:50.258
I would like to go there.

25:50.518 --> 25:52.425
Monitor how things are going.

25:53.531 --> 25:56.000
Look. There's 412 people dead.

25:56.651 --> 25:57.976
A thousand people sick.

25:58.226 --> 25:59.884
The town has been sealed

26:00.004 --> 26:02.433
until we are sure that the outbreak
has been extinguished.

26:02.553 --> 26:05.869
The problem I'm having is that
I cannot find Japanese encephalitis

26:05.989 --> 26:08.546
in any of the blood or tissue samples
that were sent to me.

26:08.666 --> 26:11.448
The problem has been dealt with.
We're done.

26:12.190 --> 26:14.409
The symptoms do not match the disease.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.511
Our doctors assure us
that it's Japanese encephalitis.

26:17.631 --> 26:19.879
And I have full confidence
in their assessment.

26:19.999 --> 26:22.375
Sir, NorBAC is respected
throughout the world.

26:23.267 --> 26:24.421
So is Moldova.

26:44.879 --> 26:46.576
Well, did he let you in?

26:47.131 --> 26:49.096
- Yeah.
- So you see the problem.

26:50.973 --> 26:52.784
I told him we could help him.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.943
- He wouldn't listen.
- It's too late for Roth.

26:56.334 --> 26:58.675
- It's not too late for us.
- What do you mean?

26:58.795 --> 27:02.040
You're carrying a human clone that
will have its Jacobson's organ intact.

27:02.690 --> 27:05.901
The research and methodology
of such an accomplishment, well,

27:06.827 --> 27:07.827
is invaluable.

27:08.066 --> 27:10.131
- We didn't do it for the money.
- Of course not.

27:11.815 --> 27:14.363
You do know where the research is,
don't you?

27:15.066 --> 27:17.264
Even if I did, why would I tell you?

27:19.852 --> 27:21.486
We both want a new future.

27:34.002 --> 27:36.120
Aren't you supposed
to be working on Roth?

27:36.240 --> 27:39.009
- I'm working on it right now. Look.
- Hey, what's this?

27:39.129 --> 27:42.154
You won't like it,
it's organic and vegetarian.

27:42.692 --> 27:43.955
You're right.

27:44.756 --> 27:47.377
- Hey, Sheila Woo, the cloning expert.
- Yeah.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.713
She was killed in a car accident.

27:51.411 --> 27:52.612
How convenient.

28:06.824 --> 28:08.506
Come on in, Bob, it's open.

28:15.005 --> 28:15.827
Nina,

28:17.106 --> 28:17.956
come in.

28:18.393 --> 28:19.730
I'm just looking for Bob.

28:19.850 --> 28:22.245
He's been looking for you everywhere.
Where you been?

28:22.405 --> 28:24.622
I needed some time
to think things out...

28:25.142 --> 28:27.384
You were right, David, about everything.

28:28.498 --> 28:31.321
It was all a horrible, terrible mistake.
Roth...

28:31.441 --> 28:32.797
the stem cells, the clone.

28:34.162 --> 28:34.962
I had...

28:35.846 --> 28:37.183
I had an abortion.

28:43.768 --> 28:47.368
Look, I'm sorry.
But you did the right thing.

28:51.202 --> 28:53.122
I worry about how he's gonna take it.

28:54.312 --> 28:56.105
He'll be happy to see you.

28:58.273 --> 29:00.033
Will you be happy to see him?

29:01.107 --> 29:02.334
I love him, David.

29:04.574 --> 29:05.374
Sure.

29:06.805 --> 29:07.900
I saw Roth.

29:08.907 --> 29:11.044
- What? Where?
- He needs help.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.628
This is the address of the hotel.
In Hoboken. Under the name Hughes.

29:15.748 --> 29:16.984
Cute. Hang on.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.518
Shit. I gotta take this.

29:20.225 --> 29:21.585
Don't go anywhere.

29:31.572 --> 29:32.821
- What?
- It's me.

29:32.941 --> 29:34.506
<i>- Hey, did you find Jack?</i>
- No.

29:34.626 --> 29:36.660
The police claim
he's a sex tourist on a bender,

29:36.780 --> 29:39.363
that he's gonna show up
in a few days. It's complete bullshit.

29:39.485 --> 29:40.719
What  are you certain of?

29:40.839 --> 29:42.929
I went back
and retested the original samples

29:43.049 --> 29:45.028
- and I noticed something weird.
- What?

29:45.148 --> 29:47.705
The results from all
the different patients were identical.

29:47.865 --> 29:49.985
Don't tell me
you're dealing with clones too.

29:50.105 --> 29:52.987
So I did some genetic testing
and confirmed that all blood,

29:53.107 --> 29:56.216
tissue and urine samples
came from one individual.

29:56.578 --> 29:58.549
- It's a snow job.
- Exactly.

29:58.766 --> 30:01.970
Troops shut down all the roads
into Birku. Telephone lines are down.

30:02.130 --> 30:03.383
Get the fuck out of there.

30:03.503 --> 30:05.187
Don't worry. The embassy knows I'm here.

30:05.307 --> 30:08.101
- Carlos!
- I can't leave until I find Jack.

30:08.416 --> 30:10.271
Okay, I'll keep you posted.

30:11.055 --> 30:12.650
Hello? Carlos!

30:20.830 --> 30:24.453
This is the address of the hotel.
In Hoboken. Under the name Hughes.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.795
Cute. Hang on.

30:26.540 --> 30:28.202
Shit. I gotta take this.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.274
Don't go anywhere.

30:40.428 --> 30:42.096
David, I'm sorry I'm...

30:42.366 --> 30:43.166
Bob!

30:43.673 --> 30:44.473
Nina.

30:44.593 --> 30:45.563
I'm sorry.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.402
I left without saying goodbye.

30:49.522 --> 30:51.603
- It's okay. You're here now.
- We have to go.

30:52.220 --> 30:54.389
- Go? Why?
- I'll explain on the way.

30:54.509 --> 30:56.941
- Nina, what's going on?
- You have to trust me.

30:58.874 --> 31:00.719
- You lied to me before.
- Bob!

31:06.956 --> 31:07.888
Listen.

31:08.439 --> 31:10.508
I worked at one of Roth's labs.

31:10.808 --> 31:13.106
He wanted to make the world
a better place.

31:13.226 --> 31:15.043
So I agreed to have a clone. Your clone.

31:15.435 --> 31:17.514
But that was before I ever met you.

31:17.634 --> 31:20.465
- You should have told me.
- You're right. I should have.

31:20.940 --> 31:24.162
We need to find David.
He'll know what to do. Where is he?

31:25.196 --> 31:26.888
I told David I had an abortion.

31:29.118 --> 31:30.115
I didn't.

31:30.857 --> 31:33.676
He'll never appreciate what's been done.

31:34.150 --> 31:36.414
A child who can feel another's pain.

31:38.778 --> 31:41.520
- And happiness.
- You had it, I had it.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.640
We both know how important it is.

31:45.812 --> 31:47.400
I just don't know, Nina.

31:47.641 --> 31:49.869
This child inside me has two parents.

31:50.069 --> 31:52.080
We're the only ones who truly love him.

31:53.659 --> 31:54.459
So,

31:54.992 --> 31:56.360
where are we going?

31:57.507 --> 31:59.773
Somewhere where no one can find us.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.383
And have our baby,

32:03.941 --> 32:07.404
and who knows,
maybe we can live happily ever after.

32:17.770 --> 32:18.635
Come on.

32:24.725 --> 32:25.525
Okay.

32:27.101 --> 32:27.901
Nina?

32:40.521 --> 32:42.805
- Carlos?
- It's Mayko. I got something for you.

32:42.925 --> 32:44.330
- What?
- You better come in.

32:44.450 --> 32:47.210
No, I gotta get to the airport
to catch the 1st flight to Newark.

32:47.330 --> 32:50.142
- I found Roth.
- You'll wanna see this, believe me.

32:50.667 --> 32:51.646
On my way.

32:56.889 --> 32:57.729
Hello.

32:57.992 --> 33:01.160
Mayko, I don't have much time.
I need you to do me a huge favour.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.080
Speak.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.452
That KH-13 satellite you were telling me
about, does one go over Moldova?

33:05.572 --> 33:07.464
Or nearby.
There're old Soviet military sites

33:07.584 --> 33:09.950
all over that region
that NATO still monitors, why?

33:10.070 --> 33:11.868
I need sat photos of Birku.

33:12.028 --> 33:13.559
I can't get anyone to take me.

33:13.679 --> 33:16.914
There are rumors of something
going on up there. People are scared.

33:17.074 --> 33:19.831
What is going on over there?
Does David know about this?

33:19.951 --> 33:21.252
Please do it.

33:34.955 --> 33:36.842
I just heard from Carlos in Moldova.

33:36.962 --> 33:39.033
I told him to get out of there.
What's he doing?

33:39.153 --> 33:40.999
- Dunno, being Carlos.
- What about Roth?

33:41.119 --> 33:42.721
OK, Roth's visitors. Politicians.

33:42.841 --> 33:45.055
Top 20 are the ones
I can identify with certainty.

33:45.175 --> 33:47.162
The Palestinian PM Pakistani General.

33:47.282 --> 33:49.585
The Venezuelan Foreign Minister.
Russian Defense Minister.

33:49.705 --> 33:51.395
Congolese rebel leader?

33:51.515 --> 33:54.050
He's got all the world's hotspots
covered. What the hell is he up to?

33:54.170 --> 33:57.163
I'm assuming he's not impregnating
their wives with Bob's clone.

33:57.323 --> 34:00.625
If this helps: the visits began
right after we found Bob.

34:03.897 --> 34:04.699
Fuck...

34:05.079 --> 34:05.879
What?

34:05.999 --> 34:08.036
Son of bitch! What did you do to him?

34:09.335 --> 34:12.094
I have enormous respect for Dr. Melnikov
and his accomplishments.

34:12.255 --> 34:13.837
You mean his Jacobson's organ.

34:13.956 --> 34:16.599
- You harvested his stem cells, right?
- At his insistence.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.475
He was a mess,
you took advantage of him.

34:18.703 --> 34:20.366
Unfortunately, his work to awaken

34:20.485 --> 34:23.231
the Jacobson organ in others
was unsuccessful.

34:23.391 --> 34:25.400
- No shit.
- When I heard he was injured...

34:25.561 --> 34:27.973
- Because of a hole you cut in his head.
- I wanted to make sure

34:28.092 --> 34:29.826
he had everything he needed.

34:30.139 --> 34:31.614
I'm telling you the truth.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.982
I am not the enemy here, Dr. Sandström.

34:37.454 --> 34:39.690
He didn't give up. He didn't drop it.

34:41.194 --> 34:44.264
This isn't about clones. This son
of a bitch has gone ahead and activated

34:44.385 --> 34:47.181
- these people's Jacobson's organ.
- My God.

34:48.246 --> 34:50.818
So the Russian Defense Minister
whose finger's on the button

34:50.938 --> 34:54.839
of the world's second largest arsenal
of nukes may be about to go insane?

34:54.958 --> 34:57.306
How the fuck are we gonna get him
in a hyperbaric chamber?

34:57.466 --> 34:59.290
Roth knows him. Maybe he can do it.

34:59.410 --> 35:01.644
After the first 20,
there're 82 more names of people

35:01.764 --> 35:03.677
I think were there
but I can't say for certain.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.901
You know what? Screw it.
I'll get the real list from Roth.

35:24.757 --> 35:26.546
- Carlos Serrano.
<i>- Hey, Carlos,</i>

35:26.786 --> 35:28.844
I sent you some photos an hour ago.

35:29.678 --> 35:31.166
Yeah, I just got them.

35:31.286 --> 35:32.962
I'm looking at them now.

35:34.570 --> 35:37.117
- It's unbelievable.
- Look, I'm no expert,

35:37.237 --> 35:39.600
- but it sure looks like...
- They were massacred.

35:40.977 --> 35:43.687
Certainly not
a Japanese encephalitis outbreak.

35:43.928 --> 35:44.728
No.

35:45.604 --> 35:48.631
It's dangerous knowledge, Carlos.
How are you gonna play it?

35:49.184 --> 35:51.393
I don't know. I have to think about it.

35:52.084 --> 35:54.202
- Let me call you back.
- Okay.

36:00.214 --> 36:01.702
What the hell are you doing?

36:01.822 --> 36:04.745
I have news.
We found your friends. The doctors.

36:04.865 --> 36:05.978
Where are they?

36:06.330 --> 36:07.218
In jail.

36:07.810 --> 36:10.003
- Why?
- They were found guilty.

36:10.371 --> 36:12.206
Of what?! When was the trial?

36:13.028 --> 36:15.155
- They will be executed in three days.
- This is crazy!

36:15.275 --> 36:18.125
Those are WHO doctors
investigating an outbreak!

36:18.245 --> 36:19.196
Doctors.

36:20.075 --> 36:24.227
Agitators. Interfering in the internal
affairs of the Republic of Moldova.

36:25.389 --> 36:26.339
Like you.

36:27.463 --> 36:28.787
Are you a doctor

36:29.344 --> 36:30.191
or a spy?

36:31.185 --> 36:32.673
And here's the answer.

36:32.793 --> 36:36.334
Just trying to figure out
what happened in Birku. That's all.

36:36.592 --> 36:40.034
- Simply a reminder to my people.
- Reminder of what?

36:43.013 --> 36:45.738
That my benevolence
cannot be questioned.

37:33.344 --> 37:34.177
Roth.

37:35.202 --> 37:36.923
Come in, David. Come in.

37:41.501 --> 37:42.874
The stem cells.

37:44.472 --> 37:47.296
The empathy. Nothing worked.
It's all a mess.

37:48.925 --> 37:51.314
How many world leaders
got Bob's stem cells?

37:51.619 --> 37:52.779
176.

37:56.552 --> 37:59.113
What about Bob's clones.
How many of those are out there?

38:00.091 --> 38:01.041
Just one.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.436
I tried to make
the world a better place.

38:13.251 --> 38:13.961
Roth?

38:15.923 --> 38:19.423
Roth! We can still stop this.
The world leaders. What are their names?

38:19.543 --> 38:21.552
Everything I do turns to shit.

38:22.399 --> 38:25.556
Everyone I touch, dies.
My son-in-law...

38:27.352 --> 38:29.060
I lost my own daughter.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.916
We can save everyone
who got the stem cells.

38:33.012 --> 38:34.392
- Too late.
- No.

38:34.512 --> 38:36.440
We put them in the hyperbaric chamber.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.570
- Treat them. You too. Just like Nina.
- Then my friend will be gone.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.155
Where'd he go?

38:43.524 --> 38:45.891
Roth. Stay with me.
Roth!

38:46.695 --> 38:48.715
- The names!
- It's too late.

38:49.709 --> 38:52.917
- What do you mean?
- The storage facilities... The labs...

38:54.136 --> 38:55.795
Head office.
Everything.

38:56.872 --> 38:57.964
I had it all burned.

38:59.316 --> 39:01.291
- Why?!
- Riddlemeyer.

39:02.943 --> 39:04.285
I had to stop him!

39:05.099 --> 39:06.775
I had to destroy it all.

39:08.574 --> 39:10.601
He was trying to steal my research.

39:12.013 --> 39:13.521
Whoa! Hey! Roth! Take it easy!

39:14.574 --> 39:16.148
Take it easy, alright? Please.

39:16.809 --> 39:18.985
Just put that down. Alright?
Put it down.

39:19.145 --> 39:20.194
No!
Wait!

39:55.714 --> 39:58.161
- What are you doing here, man?
- Hey Jack.

39:58.698 --> 40:00.198
- You okay?
- Yeah.

40:00.433 --> 40:01.622
Not really.

40:03.831 --> 40:04.991
Come sit down.

40:06.420 --> 40:07.717
Watch your head.

40:10.448 --> 40:13.789
- What the fuck is going on, Carlos?
- Emil Lupu.

40:14.567 --> 40:16.078
Minister of Health,

40:18.047 --> 40:19.489
he cleansed Birku.

40:21.018 --> 40:22.957
What do you mean "cleansed"?

40:23.795 --> 40:24.534
Gas.

40:25.366 --> 40:26.784
Sarin gas, I think.

40:28.084 --> 40:29.972
There are 10,000 people in that city.

40:31.489 --> 40:32.489
Not anymore.

40:34.152 --> 40:37.439
He was supposed to be progressive.
Western educated...

40:39.665 --> 40:41.023
What the hell happened?

40:42.195 --> 40:43.308
I don't know.

40:44.609 --> 40:45.963
I don't know, Jack.

41:03.979 --> 41:06.125
Where you going?
You aren't gonna believe what happened.

41:06.245 --> 41:07.461
You didn't hear the news?{\
- Roth.}

41:07.581 --> 41:09.804
- No, Carlos. He was arrested.
- What?!

41:09.924 --> 41:12.362
I'm on my way to a meeting
with FA and the Mexican Ambassador.

41:12.482 --> 41:13.639
Maybe you should come.

41:13.759 --> 41:16.060
- Did you call Riddlemeyer?
- He's upstairs. Waiting for you.

41:16.220 --> 41:19.021
The list of world leaders.
I'm up to 91.

41:19.527 --> 41:20.612
Check out number 89.

41:22.291 --> 41:24.819
- Who's Emil Lupu?
- Moldovan Health Minister.

41:25.869 --> 41:26.737
Shit.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.720
- Where the hell have you been, Carl?

41:34.436 --> 41:37.949
- Trying to get answers for you.
- Like fuck you have. I found Roth.

41:38.069 --> 41:39.464
- Bad?
- Dead.

41:40.895 --> 41:42.982
- Bob and Nina, where are they?
- I have no idea.

41:43.102 --> 41:46.365
- This cloning research up in smoke...
- We've important things to worry about.

41:46.485 --> 41:50.220
176 world leaders all underwent
the same procedure as Nina and Roth.

41:50.529 --> 41:52.444
Roth reactivated
all the Jacobson's organs.

41:52.564 --> 41:55.624
We don't keep them from going insane,
who knows what they'll do to the planet.

41:55.744 --> 41:58.265
Alright, I'll get my people on it.
But first, you'll help me, right?

41:58.385 --> 42:00.611
Bob and Nina are carrying
the most important breakthrough

42:00.731 --> 42:02.926
in the evolution of mankind.
I need that information.

42:03.046 --> 42:04.516
This is about money for you?

42:04.636 --> 42:07.419
- Jesus, the world is on the brink here!
- I'm trying to strike a bargain.

42:07.539 --> 42:09.549
There's Nothing to bargain with,
nothing's left!

42:09.669 --> 42:11.486
There's Bob and Nina. I want them.

42:13.066 --> 42:14.097
Fuck you.

42:14.390 --> 42:15.090
No.

42:16.088 --> 42:18.350
Fuck you.
How are you gonna get

42:18.470 --> 42:20.821
to these world leaders without me?
I put you on a No Fly List

42:20.941 --> 42:24.176
and you're not able to leave Toronto.
You need me.

42:28.188 --> 42:29.048
David!

42:30.704 --> 42:31.759
Sandström!

43:25.623 --> 43:27.747
- Hello, David.
- Hello, Bob.

43:28.465 --> 43:30.102
What are you doing here?

43:30.648 --> 43:31.946
Nice to see you too, Nina.

43:32.373 --> 43:33.656
Still pregnant, eh?

43:34.118 --> 43:35.865
- We need to get going.
- Hang on a sec,

43:35.985 --> 43:37.785
just cut me some slack, alright?

43:38.069 --> 43:40.537
You're not the easiest people to find.

43:41.795 --> 43:43.290
You look tired, David.

43:44.159 --> 43:45.542
Bob, let's take a walk.

43:46.011 --> 43:47.878
We really have to get going, David.

43:48.714 --> 43:49.755
- Bob?
- No!

43:51.819 --> 43:52.674
It's okay.

43:54.086 --> 43:55.354
I won't be long.

43:58.523 --> 44:00.433
Human cloning is illegal.

44:01.189 --> 44:03.017
In some parts of the world.

44:03.139 --> 44:05.594
- So is abortion.
- You know what you're doing is wrong.

44:05.714 --> 44:07.363
Both morally and ethically.

44:07.827 --> 44:10.839
- I'm coming to terms with it.
- Coming to terms with what?

44:11.478 --> 44:13.909
The whole notion of an empathic
human race is nothing more

44:14.029 --> 44:16.646
- than a bad science fiction movie.
- No, it's not.

44:16.881 --> 44:18.909
You ever read a little book
called Frankenstein?

44:19.069 --> 44:20.148
Nina and I,

44:20.593 --> 44:23.444
we're not giving up on this.
When our boy grows up,

44:23.564 --> 44:25.535
he'll have within him the power
to spreading gifts

44:25.655 --> 44:28.015
- throughout the world...
- You've already got Johnny Appleseed

44:28.135 --> 44:30.113
knocking up the entire planet.

44:30.233 --> 44:33.148
Don't be crude, David.
You're talking about my son.

44:33.268 --> 44:36.260
At least come back with me, okay?
Come back to the lab.

44:39.393 --> 44:40.867
I have to go, David.

44:42.977 --> 44:45.159
Bob, I am not gonna let you do this.

44:45.463 --> 44:46.740
Yes, you are!

44:54.956 --> 44:56.196
What have you done?

44:57.305 --> 45:03.234
