WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:07.841
>> IN THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.875 --> 00:11.312
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.581
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.614 --> 00:15.649
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.683 --> 00:17.085
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.118 --> 00:19.187
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.356
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.826
>> AND THE CHILDREN WERE
SLEEPING ALL SNUG IN THEIR BEDS,

00:25.859 --> 00:30.531
WHILE VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS
DANCED IN THEIR HEAD.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.634
WHAT THE HELL'S
A SUGAR PLUM?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.836
YOU EVER SEEN ONE?

00:35.869 --> 00:38.672
WHAT'S WRONG?
CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE?

00:38.706 --> 00:41.075
FINE. BE LIKE THAT.

00:41.109 --> 00:44.312
ONE THING'S FOR SURE.
MY SUGAR PLUMS AREN'T DANCIN'.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.779
THEY'RE ABOUT TO FREEZE OFF!

00:45.813 --> 00:47.515
[cat meows]

00:47.548 --> 00:53.421
PEOPLE LIVE LIKE PIGS
NOWADAYS.

00:53.454 --> 00:58.259
EXPECTIN' SOMEONE'LL
PICK UP AFTER 'EM.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.094
GOOD LORD!

01:00.128 --> 01:03.364
OH...SOMEBODY...

01:03.397 --> 01:06.200
>> [whispering] HELP ME.

01:06.234 --> 01:09.103
>> HOMELESS GUY FOUND HER
IN AN ALLEY.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.571
HER TRACHEA WAS NEARLY SEVERED

01:10.604 --> 01:11.672
WITH SOMETHING
LIKE A BOX CUTTER.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.542
>> SHE DIDN'T BLEED OUT?
>> IT'S 11 DEGREES OUTSIDE.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.577
EXPOSURE CAUSED HYPOTHERMIA,
WHICH SLOWED HER HEART

01:16.610 --> 01:18.112
AND THE BLOOD LOSS.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.148
>> SO NEARLY FREEZING
TO DEATH SAVED HER LIFE.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.183
THAT'S A HELL
OF A LUCKY BREAK.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.584
>> MAYBE HER FIRST ONE.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.753
ON EXAM, I FOUND EVIDENCE
OF CHRONIC SEXUAL ABUSE,

01:25.786 --> 01:28.322
OLD SCARS FROM BEATINGS,
AND SEVERAL HEALED FRACTURES.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.491
>> ANY IDEA HOW OLD SHE IS?

01:30.524 --> 01:33.461
>> SHE'S PREPUBESCENT,
MAYBE 10, 11.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.229
>> WHEN WILL SHE BE ABLE
TO TALK TO US?

01:35.263 --> 01:37.231
>> SHE'LL REGAIN HER SPEECH
AS THE INCISION HEALS,

01:37.265 --> 01:42.503
BUT WHEN I ASKED WHO HURT HER,
SHE DID DRAW THIS.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.406
>> THE DEVIL?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.509
>> WELCOME TO HELL.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.262
>> HE GOES BY MANY NAMES--

02:41.295 --> 02:44.232
SATAN, LUCIFER, MEPHISTOPHELES,
BEELZEBUB, OLD NICK.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.267
>> LET'S NOT FORGET
RYAN SEACREST.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.335
>> I WISH I COULD.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.303
THE REPORTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE
BY DEVIL WORSHIPPERS

02:49.337 --> 02:51.939
HAS BEEN AROUND FOR CENTURIES,
MOST RECENTLY THE 1980s.

02:51.972 --> 02:52.840
>> YEAH, WHEN WE FINALLY
FIGURED OUT

02:52.873 --> 02:54.808
THAT SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE
WAS A SHAM.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.009
>> IT DOESN'T STOP
SOME SICK BASTARD

02:56.043 --> 02:58.846
FROM USING THE DEVIL TO SCARE
HIS VICTIMS INTO SILENCE.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.948
>> WELL, SPEAKING OF
THE DEVIL AND HIS VICTIMS,

03:00.981 --> 03:03.451
WHERE ARE WE ON IDENTIFYING
JANIE DOE?

03:03.484 --> 03:05.753
>> NOWHERE. FIN SAYS
MISSING PERSONS HAS NO REPORTS

03:05.786 --> 03:06.954
MATCHING HER DESCRIPTION.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.456
>> SO WHEN CAN YOU
INTERVIEW HER?

03:08.489 --> 03:09.923
>> HOSPITAL SAYS
THIS AFTERNOON.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.460
>> OLIVIA, HEAD OVER
TO THE HOSPITAL, STAY WITH HER.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.828
ANY PERSONAL EFFECTS ON HER?
>> HER POCKETS WERE EMPTY.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.565
IF SHE HAD A BAG OR A PURSE,
I THINK THE PERP TOOK IT.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.733
>> AND THE HOMELESS GUY
WHO FOUND HER IS IN THE WIND.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.302
>> HE LEFT AS SOON AS EMS
GOT TO THE SCENE,

03:21.335 --> 03:22.803
SO WE GOT PATROL OUT
LOOKING FOR HIM.

03:22.836 --> 03:26.507
>> OUR FIRST PRIORITY'S
GOTTA BE TO I.D. OUR VICTIM.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.376
>> JOHN, RUN DOWN ANY RECENT
POLICE REPORTS

03:28.409 --> 03:31.812
OR 911 JOBS ON ANYTHING
THAT REFERENCES THE DEVIL.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.581
>> I HEAR AND OBEY,
O LORD OF DARKNESS.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.516
>> I MAY HAVE SOMETHING
FROM THE CANVASS.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.286
>> THEY FIND THE CAN MAN?
>> NO, ANOTHER WITNESS.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.588
A GUY FROM A BODEGA
REMEMBERS A KID LAST NIGHT

03:40.621 --> 03:42.490
MATCHING JANIE DOE'S
DESCRIPTION.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.261
>> YEAH, SHE WAS IN HERE
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.462
ALONE.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.331
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS STRANGE,

03:50.364 --> 03:52.333
A LITTLE GIRL ALL BY HERSELF
THAT TIME OF NIGHT?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.402
>> I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE
OR WHAT TIME YOU SHOP

03:54.435 --> 03:56.504
AS LONG AS YOU SPEND
YOUR MONEY HERE.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.372
>> YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE BOUGHT?
>> NOTHING.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.809
I CAN SPOT A BOOSTER
FROM A MILE AWAY.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.778
I THREW HER OUT BEFORE
SHE COULD RIP ME OFF.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.648
CHECK HER PANDA ON THE WAY OUT
TO MAKE SURE.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.285
>> YOU DID WHAT?
HER PANDA?

04:11.319 --> 04:13.887
>> A BACKPACK.
YOU KNOW, STUFFED ANIMAL.

04:13.921 --> 04:18.359
THE ARMS GO AROUND
LIKE STRAPS.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.329
>> WELL, TWO DEAD RATS,
BUT NO PANDA.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.831
[trash cans clattering]

04:23.864 --> 04:26.667
>> HEY, CHECK THIS OUT, EL.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.802
SOMEBODY'S GOT
A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.539
>> "THE MAJESTY AND BURNING
OF THE CHILD'S DEATH.

04:31.572 --> 04:35.876
I SHALL NOT MURDER."
>> HEY, MAN, DON'T TOUCH THAT!

04:35.909 --> 04:37.645
HEY, WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:37.678 --> 04:40.013
>> NYPD.

04:40.047 --> 04:43.317
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO FOUND
THE LITTLE GIRL, AREN'T YOU?

04:43.351 --> 04:44.284
>> ME A-AND JAKE.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.787
UH, WE BUILT THAT SHRINE
FOR THE LITTLE ONE.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.623
>> GOOD SAMARITANS
DON'T USUALLY BUILD SHRINES.

04:49.657 --> 04:53.026
>> WELL, YOU DIDN'T SEE HER
LYIN' THERE, SLIPPING AWAY.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.962
>> THEN WHY WOULD YOU RUN AWAY
WHEN EMS GOT HERE?

04:54.995 --> 04:57.531
GUILTY CONSCIENCE?
>> NO. I CALLED 'EM.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.967
JAKE JUST DOESN'T LIKE CROWDS.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.336
>> WHY'D YOU WRITE,
"I SHALL NOT MURDER"?

05:02.370 --> 05:04.905
>> THAT WAS THOMAS.
>> WHO'S THAT, ANOTHER CAT?

05:04.938 --> 05:06.774
>> NO, DYLAN THOMAS, THE POET.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.443
DRANK HIMSELF TO DEATH
AT THE WHITE HORSE.

05:09.477 --> 05:13.046
THAT'S NOT A CONFESSION.
I JUST STEAL FROM THE BEST.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.384
>> STEP AWAY FROM THE CART.
>> THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.552
YOU CAN'T SEARCH MY HOME
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.087
>> WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.823
>> DUMPSTER,
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AWAY.

05:22.856 --> 05:27.094
THERE'S NO I.D. OR MONEY.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.730
A MAN'S GOTTA EAT.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.700
>> AND A LITTLE GIRL'S
GOTTA GET AROUND.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.669
MORALES PULLED THE DATA
FROM JANIE DOE'S METROCARD.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.438
SHE BOUGHT IT TWO WEEKS AGO.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.107
MOST OF THE FARES WERE BUS RIDES
AROUND STATEN ISLAND,

05:40.140 --> 05:42.476
COUPLE OF SUBWAY TRIPS
TO MANHATTAN AND BROOKLYN.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.645
>> ANY TRIPS LAST NIGHT?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.114
>> SHE SWIPED IT AT 10:34
ON A STATEN ISLAND BUS,

05:47.147 --> 05:50.484
THEN AN HOUR LATER IN MANHATTAN
TO TAKE THE 1 TRAIN.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.086
>> SO SHE RODE THE FERRY
FROM STATEN ISLAND,

05:53.120 --> 05:55.956
THEN TOOK THE SUBWAY UPTOWN
AT 11:40 P.M.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.791
SHE WAS IN THE BODEGA
BY MIDNIGHT,

05:57.825 --> 05:59.527
SO SHE MUST HAVE
GONE STRAIGHT THERE.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.828
>> WELL, SHE DIDN'T TAKE
A 2-HOUR TRIP

06:00.861 --> 06:02.463
TO GET SODA AND CHIPS.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.164
>> IT'S A SAFE BET SHE LIVES
ON STATEN ISLAND,

06:04.197 --> 06:05.499
PROBABLY IN STAPLETON.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.402
METROCARD USAGE
IS CONCENTRATED THERE.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.704
START RINGING DOORBELLS.
SEE IF SOMEBODY CAN I.D. HER.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.506
>> THAT'S A LARGE AREA
TO CANVASS.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.608
>> THEN LET ME NARROW
YOUR SEARCH.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.076
IN MY JOURNEY

06:16.109 --> 06:17.545
THROUGH THE PARANOID UNDERWORLD
OF THE SATANIC,

06:17.578 --> 06:19.112
I PULLED A BUNCH OF REPORTS

06:19.146 --> 06:21.181
ABOUT DEMONIC ACTIVITY
IN STAPLETON.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.150
>> IT'S THE SECRET PORTAL
TO HELL.

06:23.183 --> 06:26.420
>> THAT WOULD BE TOLEDO, BUT
STAPLETON RUNS A CLOSE SECOND,

06:26.454 --> 06:28.422
ACCORDING TO
A MRS. DORIS DiNUZIO.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.191
>> AND SHE IS...
>> A CONCERNED CITIZEN.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.026
SHE LIVES ACROSS THE STREET
FROM ST. ADRIAN'S CHURCH.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.429
SHE MADE 39 REPORTS
TO HER LOCAL PRECINCT

06:35.463 --> 06:38.832
THAT HER PRIEST IS A DEVIL
WORSHIPPER ON THE DOWN LOW.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.437
>> AMERICA'S GOT A MILLION
SECRET SATANISTS.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.473
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
ASK MAURY POVICH.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.041
>> WHAT'S THE PRIEST'S NAME?
>> FATHER THEO BURDETT.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.511
FAKER. HE'S SHACKING UP
WITH A WOMAN.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.513
>> IT MAY BE A SIN,
BUT IT'S NOT DEVIL WORSHIP.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.114
>> I'M JUST GETTIN' STARTED.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.116
I MEAN, THERE'S THE DRUMMING,
SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT LONG,

06:56.149 --> 06:58.986
AND THERE'S CHANTING
IN SOME WEIRD LANGUAGE.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.521
>> COULD THEY BE SPEAKING
IN TONGUES?

07:00.554 --> 07:01.955
>> NO. I GOT A SISTER IN FLORIDA

07:01.989 --> 07:04.458
MARRIED TO A PENTECOSTAL
SNAKE HANDLER.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.726
I KNOW TONGUE TALK.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.094
>> IN ONE OF YOUR COMPLAINTS,

07:07.127 --> 07:08.862
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT
ANIMAL SACRIFICES?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.097
>> ONE DAY HE'S GOT
CHICKENS AND GOATS

07:10.130 --> 07:13.501
RUNNING AROUND THE PARISH HOUSE,
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY--SSST!

07:13.534 --> 07:16.236
I SAW HIM WITH THE MACHETE.
IT WAS ALL COVERED WITH BLOOD.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.839
>> YOU EVER SEE THIS LITTLE GIRL
WITH FATHER THEO?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.941
>> OF COURSE I HAVE.
SHE LIVES WITH HIM.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.810
SHOWED UP ONE DAY
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.112
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
AROUND LATELY.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.680
YOU THINK HE SACRIFICED HER?

07:26.714 --> 07:29.149
YOU KNOW, I GOT MARRIED
OVER AT ST. ADRIAN'S,

07:29.182 --> 07:32.052
AND NOW I'M TOO SCARED TO SET
FOOT IN THAT HAUNTED HOUSE.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.521
>> I DON'T SEE ANY GHOSTS.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.556
>> YOU NEVER WENT
TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.224
I STILL GOT NIGHTMARES
ABOUT SISTER MARY MARGARET

07:37.257 --> 07:38.325
AND HER MOUSTACHE.

07:38.358 --> 07:41.995
>> 'SCUSE ME, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR FATHER THEO BURDETT.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.064
>> HAS HE DONE SOMETHING WRONG?

07:44.097 --> 07:45.599
>> WE'VE JUST HAD
SOME COMPLAINTS

07:45.633 --> 07:46.867
ABOUT STRANGE ACTIVITIES
HERE AT THE CHURCH.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.868
>> "THOU HYPOCRITE!

07:47.901 --> 07:51.572
CAST OUT FIRST THE BEAM
OUT OF THINE OWN EYE."

07:51.605 --> 07:54.241
>> FATHER BURDETT?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.810
>> YES. WHAT'S SHE SAID
THIS TIME?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.546
AM I SKIMMING FROM THE BINGO

07:58.579 --> 08:00.013
OR DIPPING
IN THE COMMUNION WINE?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.782
>> YOU'RE SLAUGHTERING ANIMALS
AND VIRGINS.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.852
>> [laughs] THIS PARISH
HAS CHANGED, DETECTIVES.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.253
IT'S NO LONGER
IRISH AND ITALIAN.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.387
IT'S AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS,

08:07.420 --> 08:10.558
AND THEY BRING THEIR OWN
WORSHIP PRACTICES TO THE CHURCH.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.593
>> SO THE DRUMMING
AND THE CHANTING...

08:12.626 --> 08:13.694
>> IT'S ALL PART
OF THEIR CATHOLIC FAITH.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.296
AND AS FOR THE ANIMALS,
I RAISE CHICKENS AND GOATS,

08:16.329 --> 08:17.297
MY OTHER FLOCK.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.167
AND WE HAVE TRADITIONAL
GATHERINGS WHERE, YES,

08:20.200 --> 08:21.769
THE ANIMALS ARE HUMANELY
SLAUGHTERED

08:21.802 --> 08:23.771
AND COOKED
FOR A COMMUNITY MEAL.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.006
I'M SIMPLY HONORING
THEIR CULTURAL HERITAGES.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.109
>> IS HAVING A WIFE
PART OF THAT?

08:29.142 --> 08:30.544
>> I WAS AN EPISCOPAL PRIEST

08:30.578 --> 08:32.880
BEFORE I WAS ORDAINED
IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.215
VATICAN LAW ALLOWS ME
TO REMAIN MARRIED.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.551
THERE'S EVEN A PRIEST DOWN
IN ALABAMA GETTING A DIVORCE.

08:37.585 --> 08:38.552
>> WHO KNEW?

08:38.586 --> 08:40.120
>> NOW, IF YOU EXCUSE ME,

08:40.153 --> 08:43.056
I THINK I'VE WASTED ENOUGH TIME
ON MS. DiNUZIO'S BIGOTRY.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.692
>> OH, JUST ONE MORE
THING, FATHER.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.895
THIS GIRL,
DOES SHE LIVE HERE?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.830
>> THAT'S MIRIAM!

08:49.863 --> 08:51.932
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

08:51.965 --> 08:54.568
>> SHE WAS ASSAULTED.
SHE'S IN A HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.104
>> OH, DEAR GOD.
TAKE ME TO HER.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.139
>> W-WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP
TO HER?

08:59.172 --> 09:02.810
>> SHE'S OUR DAUGHTER!

09:02.843 --> 09:06.880
ONDINE AND I MET MIRIAM
WHEN WE WERE DOING RELIEF WORK

09:06.914 --> 09:08.949
AT THE KAKUMA REFUGEE CAMP
IN KENYA.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.317
>> WHERE'S SHE FROM?

09:10.350 --> 09:12.620
>> SUDAN, UGANDA, MAYBE CONGO.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.122
SHE SPEAKS DINKA, ACHIOLI,
SWAHILI,

09:15.155 --> 09:17.891
BUT SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHICH IS HER NATIVE LANGUAGE.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.360
SHE REMEMBERS NOTHING
ABOUT HER PAST LIFE

09:20.393 --> 09:21.361
BEFORE THE CAMP.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.330
>> TRAUMATIC AMNESIA?

09:23.363 --> 09:25.232
>> THAT'S WHAT THOSE
DOCTORS AT KAKUMA THOUGHT.

09:25.265 --> 09:29.102
SHE WAS EIGHT OR NINE
WHEN STRANGERS BROUGHT HER IN.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.639
>> THEY FOUND HER ON THE SIDE
OF THE ROAD, HALF-DEAD.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.642
PROBABLY SOME SEX SLAVE
TO A REBEL GROUP.

09:34.675 --> 09:39.079
SHE ENDURED REPEATED BEATINGS
AND RAPES.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.714
>> WE'VE SEEN
THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.115
>> SO YOU KNOW
SHE SURVIVED HELL.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.985
>> WE ADOPTED HER BECAUSE
WE THOUGHT THAT IN AMERICA

09:45.018 --> 09:46.954
SHE WOULD HAVE
THE KIND OF LIFE SHE DESERVED.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.722
>> AND YET, WHEN SHE
DISAPPEARED LAST NIGHT,

09:48.756 --> 09:50.357
YOU DIDN'T FILE
A MISSING PERSONS REPORT.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.660
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS MISSING.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.361
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AT A YOUTH CAMP RETREAT

09:54.394 --> 09:55.996
IN SPRING LAKE.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.965
>> WE FOUND HER IN HARLEM.

09:57.998 --> 10:02.069
ANY REASON SHE'D BE THERE?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.805
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.675
>> SHE ASKED FOR PERMISSION
TO SEE HIM YESTERDAY.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.977
>> WHAT? WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.144
>> BECAUSE YOU OVERREACT!

10:11.178 --> 10:13.113
>> I TOLD YOU NOT
TO LET THEM BE ALONE!

10:13.146 --> 10:15.749
>> THEY ARE GOOD FOR EACH OTHER!
>> SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL!

10:15.783 --> 10:19.052
HE'S ALMOST 30!
>> FOLKS, TELL US WHO HE IS.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.822
>> THEY BOTH WALKED
THROUGH JUNGLES

10:21.855 --> 10:25.125
AND ACROSS LANDMINES
TO FREEDOM.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.226
NOW, DO YOU THINK

10:26.259 --> 10:28.328
THAT I COULD REALLY STOP THEM
FROM BEING TOGETHER?

10:28.361 --> 10:29.730
>> HE'S THE ONE
THAT ATTACKED MIRIAM.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.700
>> COULDN'T HAVE!
HE'S A GENTLE SOUL.

10:32.733 --> 10:37.705
>> OH, GENTLE, MY ASS!
>> WHO, REVEREND?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.306
>> ELIJAH OKELLO.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.943
>> AND WHY DO YOU SUSPECT HIM?

10:42.976 --> 10:46.113
>> HE'S KILLED BEFORE.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.655
>> DO YOU WANNA EXPLAIN

10:55.689 --> 10:57.991
HOW YOU LET A MURDERER HANG
AROUND WITH YOUR LITTLE GIRL?

10:58.025 --> 10:59.392
>> ELIJAH WASN'T REALLY
A MURDERER.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.328
>> WELL, YOU SAID
THAT HE'S KILLED BEFORE.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.330
>> ELIJAH'S FROM
NORTHERN UGANDA.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.799
WHEN HE WAS SEVEN,
THE LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY

11:05.833 --> 11:08.769
BURNED HIS VILLAGE,
KIDNAPPED THE KIDS,

11:08.802 --> 11:10.437
AND FORCED THE BOYS
TO BECOME SOLDIERS.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.073
>> SO HE SPENT HIS CHILDHOOD
AS A KILLER.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.775
>> UNTIL HE WAS 19,
AND THEN HE ESCAPED

11:14.808 --> 11:16.810
AND EVENTUALLY
RESETTLED IN THE STATES.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.378
>> HOW DID YOU MEET HIM?

11:18.411 --> 11:21.882
>> HE SHOWED UP AT ST. ADRIAN'S
ONE DAY LAST FALL.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.151
A LOT OF REFUGEES
FIND THEIR WAY TO US.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.920
HE SINGS IN OUR CHOIR
WITH MIRIAM,

11:26.954 --> 11:28.822
AND HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.
IT'S CLEAR AND PURE.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.291
>> HIS SOUL
ISN'T SO SPOTLESS.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.293
>> HE WAS FORCED TO SIN.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.329
ELIJAH WAS A KILLER,
BUT HE WAS ALSO A VICTIM.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.332
>> STILL, HE WAS BROUGHT UP
IN BLOODSHED AND VIOLENCE.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.035
OLD HABITS DIE HARD.
WHERE DOES HE LIVE?

11:42.069 --> 11:45.739
>> HE SHARES AN APARTMENT
WITH OTHER UGANDAN REFUGEES.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.911
[loud knocking]

11:53.380 --> 11:55.282
>> HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.751
>> LOOKING FOR ELIJAH OKELLO.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.253
>> PLEASE COME IN.
HE'S IN THE KITCHEN.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.056
SHALL I GET HIM FOR--
>> SHH. SURPRISE.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.495
ELIJAH?

12:08.528 --> 12:11.264
>> N-NO, I-I'M NATHANIEL.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.768
DIDN'T ELIJAH LET YOU IN?

12:14.802 --> 12:19.239
>> REQUESTING BACKUP
AT 445 WEST 121.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.809
IN FOOT PURSUIT OF SUSPECT
ELIJAH OKELLO.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.877
>> HE'S GONE.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.082
>> YOU DOOR-KNOCKED A SUSPECT
WITHOUT HAVING HIS PHOTO?

12:29.116 --> 12:31.118
>> ELIJAH'S NOT IN THE SYSTEM.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.420
FATHER THEO DIDN'T HAVE A
PICTURE OF HIM AT THE HOSPITAL.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.522
NO DRIVER'S LICENSE,
NO MUG SHOT.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.890
>> WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE TRIED FACEBOOK.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.491
>> WE SCREWED UP.
WE'LL FIND HIM.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.928
>> PREFERABLY BEFORE
HE SLITS SOMEBODY ELSE'S THROAT.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.830
ANY LEADS?

12:42.863 --> 12:45.332
>> WE TOSSED HIS ROOM.
DIDN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING.

12:45.365 --> 12:48.168
HIS HOUSEMATE SAYS HE'S GOT
NO CREDIT CARD, NO CELL PHONE.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.502
>> SO YOU'RE NOWHERE.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.071
>> WELL, MIRIAM SHOULD BE
ABLE TO TALK BY NOW,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.106
SO LIV AND I ARE GONNA
GO DOWN TO THE HOSPITAL.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.142
>> TRY ST. ADRIAN'S.
DR. BERESFORD CALLED.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.211
SAID SHE'S AWAKE AND ALERT.
THE BURDETTS TOOK HER HOME.

13:01.448 --> 13:05.485
>> MY NAME'S OLIVIA,
AND I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

13:05.518 --> 13:10.824
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.060
I KNOW YOU CAN'T TALK, SO...

13:13.093 --> 13:15.195
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD WRITE.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.230
>> OH, SHE NEVER LEARNED TO.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.567
WE JUST STARTED LESSONS.
BUT SHE CAN SIGN.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.836
>> ASL?
>> NO, NO, NO.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.337
IT'S A PANTOMIME
WE USED IN KAKUMA

13:24.371 --> 13:27.107
BEFORE SHE LEARNED ENGLISH.

13:27.140 --> 13:31.511
>> SO YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

13:31.544 --> 13:34.214
WHEN YOU LEFT YOUR HOUSE,
WHERE DID YOU GO?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.216
>> TO THE BOAT.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.151
>> THE STATEN ISLAND FERRY.

13:38.185 --> 13:42.856
AND THEN WHERE DID YOU GO?

13:42.890 --> 13:45.926
TO SEE ELIJAH.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.961
>> AT HIS HOUSE.

13:47.995 --> 13:52.165
>> AND DID HE GO WITH YOU
TO THE STORE?

13:52.199 --> 13:56.069
SO MIRIAM, WHAT'S THE LAST
THING YOU DO REMEMBER?

13:56.103 --> 13:59.940
>> BEING WITH ELIJAH.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.010
>> SHE SAYS
HE WOULD NEVER HURT HER.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.278
HE LOVES HER.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.882
>> MIRIAM, ARE THERE
ANY SPECIAL PLACES

14:08.916 --> 14:09.649
THAT ELIJAH LIKES TO GO?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.985
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM,

14:12.019 --> 14:15.956
AND MAYBE HE CAN HELP ME
FIGURE OUT WHO HURT YOU.

14:15.989 --> 14:20.060
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN TELL HER.

14:22.129 --> 14:26.133
CHURCH.
NOT A CHURCH.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.402
BUT LIKE A CHURCH--
MOSQUE.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.639
TEMPLE?
TEMPLE OF BOOKS.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.543
>> THE LIBRARY?
>> YES.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.012
ELIJAH WAS TAKING
SOME COURSES

14:39.046 --> 14:41.281
AT HUDSON UNIVERSITY.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.050
>> THE LIBRARY
STAYS OPEN ALL NIGHT,

14:43.083 --> 14:44.517
SO IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO HIDE

14:44.551 --> 14:46.186
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE RUN
WITH NO MONEY.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.121
>> I PRAY THAT I'M WRONG
AND ELIJAH DIDN'T DO THIS.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.689
>> WE'LL KNOW
WHEN WE TALK WITH HIM.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.124
>> YOU'LL CALL ME
WHEN YOU HAVE NEWS?

14:51.158 --> 14:52.259
>> WE WILL.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.140
SON OF A BITCH.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.209
>> I'D EXPECT A FIRE BOMBING
IN--IN AFRICA,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.978
BUT ON STATEN ISLAND?

15:11.011 --> 15:13.146
I NEVER EXPECTED THIS TO HAPPEN
IN AMERICA TODAY.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.547
>> YOU CAN'T EXPECT
CHILD SOLDIERS

15:14.581 --> 15:16.216
TO FORGET
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.551
>> YOU THINK ELIJAH DID THIS?

15:18.585 --> 15:19.987
>> OR ONE OF HIS OLD FRIENDS

15:20.020 --> 15:22.222
TRYING TO SCARE MIRIAM
INTO SILENCE.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.191
>> WELL...IT WORKED.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.060
SHE'S CUDDLED UP
LIKE A MOUSE UNDER THE COVERS.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.728
YOUR PARTNER'S
TRYING TO TALK TO HER.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.263
SHE WON'T COME OUT.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.632
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.035
>> ONDINE,
DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.670
>> I THOUGHT ELIJAH'S
FRIENDSHIP WOULD HELP HER HEAL.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.074
NOW LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE.

15:41.108 --> 15:45.078
FIND ELIJAH.
MAKE MY DAUGHTER SAFE.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.383
>> HOBBES' LEVIATHAN.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.720
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO READ THAT.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.323
>> NOT THIS TIME.
>> I'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG!

15:56.356 --> 15:58.525
>> PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.093
GASOLINE.
HIS CLOTHES REEK OF IT.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.029
>> THIS SHIRT BELONGS
TO MY ROOMMATE.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.563
HE WORKS
AT A PETROL STATION.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.066
>> DID HE GIVE YOU
AN EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT

16:06.099 --> 16:06.733
FOR MOLOTOV COCKTAILS?

16:06.766 --> 16:09.402
LET'S GO.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.639
>> YES, I WAS A SOLDIER
MANY YEARS AGO.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.774
IT WAS ANOTHER LIFE.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.210
>> I WAS A MARINE.

16:17.244 --> 16:20.480
I'LL NEVER FORGET
WHAT I LEARNED IN BOOT CAMP.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.017
STILL USE MY SKILLS
ON OCCASION.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.419
>> YOU DON'T SCARE ME,
DETECTIVE.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.055
TO GET ME TO JOIN THE LRA,

16:28.088 --> 16:32.459
THEY SHOT MY MOTHER
IN THE HEART IN FRONT OF ME.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.461
>> HOW MANY MOTHERS YOU SHOOT?

16:34.494 --> 16:35.795
>> I DON'T KNOW.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.031
MOSTLY I JUST FIRED MY WEAPON
INTO THE BUSH.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.500
>> BUT YOU HAVE KILLED BEFORE.
>> YES, YES.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.802
IN THE PAST.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRESENT.

16:42.835 --> 16:47.374
NOW, YOUR FRIEND, MIRIAM.
WERE YOU WITH HER LAST NIGHT?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.142
>> YES.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.111
WE TOOK A WALK.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.346
>> THEN WHAT?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.148
>> I HAD TO GO SEE SOMEONE.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.350
I TOLD HER TO WAIT
IN THE STORE,

16:57.384 --> 16:59.152
BUT WHEN I RETURNED,
SHE WAS GONE.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.354
>> WELL, THAT'S CONVENIENT.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.323
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MIRIAM?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.292
>> THAT'S GOOD.
YOU ALMOST SOUND SINCERE.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.694
>> I AM SINCERE!
SHE'S MY SPECIAL FRIEND!

17:07.727 --> 17:10.097
>> DID YOU WANT A LITTLE
SPECIAL FRIENDSHIP LAST NIGHT,

17:10.130 --> 17:11.698
BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT?

17:11.731 --> 17:12.765
>> SHE'S A CHILD.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.235
>> YOU WERE MURDERING PEOPLE
AT HER AGE--SO WHAT?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.170
>> IT WASN'T MY CHOICE.
THEY MADE ME TO IT.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.705
>> THEY MAKE YOU RAPE TOO?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.707
'CAUSE I KNOW THE LRA
USES RAPE AS A WEAPON.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.276
>> YES, SOME DID IT.
I WOULD NEVER FORCE A WOMAN.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.778
MIRIAM HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH
ALREADY!

17:25.812 --> 17:27.847
I HAVE SWORN
THAT SHE WOULD NOT CRY AGAIN.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.152
>> THEN HOW DID SHE GO
FROM TAKING A WALK WITH YOU...

17:32.185 --> 17:36.189
TO DYING IN A DIRTY ALLEY
WITH HER THROAT CUT?

17:36.223 --> 17:40.360
>> MIRIAM'S DEAD?

17:40.393 --> 17:44.097
>> NO. BUT IT'S A MIRACLE
SHE'S ALIVE.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.402
>> IT'S MY FAULT.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.139
EVERYTHING...I TOUCH,

17:52.172 --> 17:57.610
EVERYONE I LOVE I CORRUPT.

17:57.644 --> 18:01.114
HAVE MERCY ON ME.

18:03.850 --> 18:08.621
>> MY GOD, I AM MOST HEARTILY
SORRY FOR HAVING OFFENDED THEE.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.358
AND I DETEST MY SINS,

18:11.391 --> 18:14.494
FOR I FEAR THE LOSS OF HEAVEN
AND THE PAINS OF HELL.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.163
>> YES.

18:16.196 --> 18:21.401
>> AND MOST OF ALL, FOR HAVING
OFFENDED THEE, MY GOD...

18:21.434 --> 18:23.203
[whispering]
WHO ARE ALL GOOD

18:23.236 --> 18:27.274
AND MOST DESERVING
OF ALL MY LOVE.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.710
>> [together]
I FIRMLY RESOLVE...

18:30.743 --> 18:33.646
>> TO CONFESS MY SINS...

18:33.680 --> 18:35.248
TO DO PENANCE...

18:35.282 --> 18:36.883
>> [whispering]
DO PENANCE...

18:36.916 --> 18:40.187
>> [together]
AND TO AMEND MY LIFE.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.456
>> AMEN.
>> AMEN. [sobs]

18:43.490 --> 18:45.392
[whispering]
>> ELIJAH, CONFESS TO ME.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.195
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE YOUR SOUL.

18:48.228 --> 18:52.265
JUST CONFESS.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.435
>> I'VE KILLED SO MANY.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.908
>> GO ON.
>> I STABBED THEM!

19:01.941 --> 19:05.212
I SHOT THEM, I BURNED THEM!

19:05.245 --> 19:10.750
I CAN STILL SEE THE BODIES.
SO MUCH BLOOD!

19:10.783 --> 19:13.386
THEY COME TO ME AT NIGHT.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.356
THEY ASK ME,
"WHY DID YOU KILL ME, ELIJAH?"

19:16.389 --> 19:19.226
[breathing heavily]

19:19.259 --> 19:24.264
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER.

19:24.297 --> 19:28.201
I DREAM OF MY MOTHER
BEGGING ME TO SAVE HER LIFE...

19:28.235 --> 19:29.469
AND I DO NOTHING!

19:29.502 --> 19:35.475
I SEE HER DIE, EVERY NIGHT!

19:35.508 --> 19:38.445
I AM A COWARD.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.780
AND A MURDERER.

19:40.813 --> 19:44.751
GOD HAVE MERCY ON ME,
I CAN'T BEAR THIS PAIN!

19:44.784 --> 19:46.819
>> TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.456
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.425
>> I WENT TO TAKE A LIFE.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.662
>> MIRIAM'S.
>> NO!

19:55.695 --> 20:01.000
>> THEN WHOSE?
>> I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.271
MIRIAM JUST CALLS HIM
THE DEVIL.

20:07.039 --> 20:11.644
FOR THREE YEARS,
SHE WAS HIS SEX SLAVE.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.489
>> MIRIAM SPOTTED THE MAN
THAT SHE CALLS THE DEVIL

20:22.522 --> 20:23.856
AT A WEDDING TWO WEEKS AGO.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.858
SHE FOLLOWS HIM
TO AN APARTMENT IN HARLEM,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.026
AND THEN SHE TELLS ELIJAH.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.995
>> AND ASKED HIM
TO KILL HER RAPIST.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.398
>> YES. HE LIVES AROUND
THE CORNER FROM THE BODEGA.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.999
MIRIAM IS SUPPOSED
TO SIGNAL ELIJAH

20:33.032 --> 20:35.001
WHEN SHE SEES HER ABUSER
COMING HOME FROM WORK.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.036
>> BUT WHEN SHE GETS KICKED
OUT OF THE BODEGA,

20:37.069 --> 20:38.871
SHE MUST HAVE RUN INTO HIM,
HE RECOGNIZED HER,

20:38.905 --> 20:39.939
TRIED TO SHUT HER UP.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.041
>> BUT I THOUGHT MIRIAM
COULDN'T REMEMBER HER LIFE

20:42.074 --> 20:43.976
BEFORE THE REFUGEE CAMP.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.445
>> RIGHT. ACCORDING TO ELIJAH,

20:45.478 --> 20:47.280
HER MEMORY RETURNED
WHEN SHE SAW HER ATTACKER.

20:47.314 --> 20:48.815
>> WELL, THAT'S
A CONVENIENT STORY.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.016
BLAMES IT ALL
ON THE MYSTERY WARLORD.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.352
>> I BELIEVE HIM.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.488
>> WHY?
BECAUSE HE PRAYED WITH YOU?

20:55.522 --> 20:59.326
>> I KNOW WHAT ELIJAH'S DONE.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.694
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
THAT HE WOULD HURT MIRIAM.

21:01.728 --> 21:05.998
>> YOU BELIEVE HIM TOO?
>> HE LOST HIS ENTIRE FAMILY.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.634
MIRIAM'S ALL HE'S GOT.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.002
>> AND ALL YOU GOT IS YOUR GUT.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.071
>> AND A LEAD
ON A POSSIBLE BAD GUY.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.906
THE BUILDING THAT MIRIAM
TRACKED HIM TO

21:13.940 --> 21:15.408
HAD THREE APARTMENTS IN IT.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.709
TWO ARE REGISTERED TO WOMEN.

21:16.743 --> 21:20.447
THE THIRD IS REGISTERED
TO A SAMUEL MBAZZI.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.482
>> ACCORDING TO HIS
IMMIGRATION FILE...

21:22.515 --> 21:24.384
HE'S ORIGINALLY FROM UGANDA.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.953
>> MBAZZI CLAIMED
POLITICAL ASYLUM IN 2004,

21:26.986 --> 21:28.888
GOT HIS GREEN CARD
TWO YEARS AGO.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.657
JUST APPLIED FOR CITIZENSHIP.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.958
>> IS HE A WORKING MAN?

21:31.991 --> 21:33.793
>> HE LISTS HIS PROFESSION
AS JANITOR.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.894
>> WELL, I GUESS THEY DIDN'T
HAVE A BOX FOR WARLORD.

21:34.927 --> 21:37.764
I'LL GO PICK HIM UP.
>> NOT WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.432
MIRIAM'S NOT TALKING,

21:39.466 --> 21:42.435
AND ELIJAH CAN'T I.D. A MAN
THAT HE'S NEVER SEEN.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.371
NOT TO MENTION THAT MBAZZI
GOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH

21:44.404 --> 21:45.572
FROM IMMIGRATION.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.739
>> YOU MEAN THE SAME GUYS

21:46.773 --> 21:48.408
WHO GAVE VISAS
TO A BUNCH OF JIHADISTS

21:48.441 --> 21:49.576
SO THEY COULD GO
TO FLIGHT SCHOOL?

21:49.609 --> 21:52.445
>> CAPTAIN, JUST LET ME
TALK TO THE GUY.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.847
>> SAY HELLO.
NOTHING MORE.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.886
>> MR. MBAZZI,
WE'RE FROM IMMIGRATION.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.087
>> IS THERE A PROBLEM?

22:01.120 --> 22:02.955
>> WE HAVE
SOME FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS

22:02.989 --> 22:04.624
ON YOUR APPLICATION
FOR CITIZENSHIP.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.459
>> ASK ME ANYTHING.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.461
>> YOU'RE ORIGINALLY
FROM UGANDA?

22:08.495 --> 22:10.530
>> CERTAINLY,
THAT IS IN MY FILE.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.865
>> JUST BEING THOROUGH.
WHAT WAS YOUR PROFESSION?

22:12.899 --> 22:14.867
>> TEACHER.
>> AND NOW YOU WORK...

22:14.901 --> 22:16.936
>> AT THE LAW FIRM
OF PEHLKE AND ZIMMER.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.406
>> YOU'RE AN ATTORNEY.
>> A CLEANER.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.107
>> YOU TAKE TODAY OFF?

22:21.140 --> 22:22.942
>> I WORK NIGHTS.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.077
>> YOU WORK LAST NIGHT?
>> I STAYED HOME IN BED.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.714
>> I WAS ILL
WITH A TOUCH OF A FLU.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.849
>> YEAH, A LOT OF VIRUSES
GOING AROUND NOW.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.984
UH...CAN ANYONE VOUCH
FOR YOUR WHEREABOUTS?

22:32.018 --> 22:35.855
>> I LIVE ALONE.
IN FACT, I STILL FEEL WEAK.

22:35.888 --> 22:40.993
PERHAPS WE CAN CONTINUE
THIS CONVERSATION ANOTHER DAY.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.398
>> HE'S OUR GUY,
AND WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.566
>> UNLESS WE CAN PROVE
HE'S A WARLORD

22:46.599 --> 22:48.067
AND NOT A SCHOOLTEACHER.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.536
>> I DON'T THINK ONE PP
IS GONNA AUTHORIZE

22:49.569 --> 22:51.704
A FACT-FINDING TRIP
TO KAMPALA.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.873
>> MAYBE WE DON'T NEED ONE.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.917
>> ALEXANDRA CABOT.
>> THANKS FOR MEETING ME, RAJIV.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.486
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.455
FIRST THE CRIMSON
RUNS YOUR OBITUARY,

23:08.488 --> 23:09.689
THEN YOUR RETURN FROM THE DEAD

23:09.722 --> 23:11.157
IS THE TALK
OF OUR TEN-YEAR REUNION.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.060
>> AND YOU'RE WITH THE U.N.
HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.463
>> LONG WAY FROM LATE NIGHTS
AT CHARLIE'S KITCHEN

23:16.496 --> 23:17.664
ARGUING CON LAW
OVER BURGERS.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.632
>> MAYBE NOT.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.801
I AM INVESTIGATING
A UGANDAN MAN

23:21.834 --> 23:23.770
WHO MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED
IN WAR CRIMES.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.439
>> THIS MAN,
HE'S HERE IN THE STATES?

23:26.473 --> 23:28.441
>> YES. POTENTIALLY
UNDER A FALSE NAME.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.042
I NEED TO ESTABLISH
HIS REAL IDENTITY.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.712
>> THE U.N. IS NOT
A LAW ENFORCEMENT BODY, ALEX.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.981
WE DON'T INVESTIGATE
INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS,

23:35.014 --> 23:36.949
AND EVEN IF WE HAD FILES,

23:36.983 --> 23:39.185
YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE
A REQUEST THROUGH CHANNELS.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.052
>> RAJIV, HE SLIT THE THROAT

23:40.086 --> 23:42.522
OF A LITTLE GIRL
WHO COULD IDENTIFY HIM,

23:42.555 --> 23:44.056
AND THAT IS THE VERY LEAST

23:44.090 --> 23:47.560
OF WHAT HE HAS ALREADY
DONE TO HER.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.028
>> THE INTERNATIONAL
CRIMINAL COURT

23:49.061 --> 23:50.997
HAS BEEN PROSECUTING
WAR CRIMES IN UGANDA.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.500
>> THE ICC HAS
SURVIVOR TESTIMONY?

23:53.533 --> 23:56.102
>> AND A PHOTO ARCHIVE
ALL OPEN TO THE PUBLIC

23:56.135 --> 23:57.970
AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS
IN THE HAGUE.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.172
>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE
THOSE FILES

24:00.206 --> 24:03.442
COULD MAGICALLY GET TO ME?

24:04.611 --> 24:06.646
>> PICTURE QUALITY'S TERRIBLE.

24:06.679 --> 24:10.583
>> YEAH. MY CONTACT AT THE ICC
EMAILED THEM LOW RES.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.819
I CAN SEE ENOUGH
TO BREAK MY HEART, THOUGH.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.654
THE RIFLES
ARE BIGGER THAN THEY ARE.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.556
>> YOU KNOW WHERE WE GOT
THE TERM INFANTRY?

24:16.589 --> 24:17.757
>> HUH?

24:17.790 --> 24:21.694
>> ROMANS, WHO PUT THE YOUNGEST
SOLDIERS ON THE FRONT LINE

24:21.728 --> 24:23.730
TO BE THE FIRST TO DIE.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.198
>> 2,000 YEARS LATER, WE'VE
SEQUENCED THE HUMAN GENOME,

24:26.232 --> 24:28.768
BUT WE STILL CAN'T FIND A WAY
TO KEEP OUR KIDS SAFE.

24:35.675 --> 24:38.010
>> THAT COULD BE MBAZZI.

24:38.044 --> 24:41.514
>> I'LL PULL UP THE ORIGINAL.

24:45.552 --> 24:46.753
>> OH, THAT'S HIM.

24:46.786 --> 24:50.590
>> EXCEPT HIS REAL NAME
IS JOSEPH SERUMAGA.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.626
A REBEL COMMANDER WANTED
FOR WAR CRIMES BY THE ICC.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.562
HE WAS ABOUT TO BE INDICTED
WHEN HE DISAPPEARED.

24:55.595 --> 24:56.563
>> AND HE'S GOT
SOME TRACK RECORD.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.198
HE ONCE LOCKED AN ENTIRE
VILLAGE INSIDE A CHURCH

24:59.231 --> 25:00.733
AND SET IT ON FIRE?

25:00.767 --> 25:03.570
>> WHICH EARNED HIM THE NICKNAME
"THE DEVIL OF GULU."

25:03.603 --> 25:08.207
>> MIRIAM WAS RIGHT.
DEVIL REALLY DID DO IT.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.944
>> [humming]

25:11.978 --> 25:15.014
>> I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.016
>> MORE QUESTIONS?

25:17.049 --> 25:20.286
>> YEAH, I FORGOT TO ASK YOU
WHAT YOU TAUGHT IN UGANDA.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.022
>> MATHEMATICS.

25:23.055 --> 25:27.126
>> AS IN YOU PLUS A CHURCH
FULL OF TERRIFIED CIVILIANS

25:27.159 --> 25:29.762
EQUALS MASSACRE?

25:29.796 --> 25:31.964
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.333
>> JOSEPH SERUMAGA.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.336
>> YOU HAVE THE WRONG MAN.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.205
MY NAME IS--

25:39.238 --> 25:41.641
>> THE DEVIL OF GULU.

25:47.647 --> 25:52.184
>> GIVE ME AN EXCUSE.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.687
GIVE ME AN EXCUSE!

25:56.756 --> 25:58.324
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.793
>> I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.
I WANT AN ATTORNEY.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.795
>> YEAH. THEY'LL JUST BE
DYING TO REPRESENT

26:02.829 --> 26:05.698
THE WAR CRIMINAL
WHO CLEANS THEIR TOILETS.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.903
>> SERUMAGA HASN'T SAID
A WORD SINCE WE BROUGHT HIM IN.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.773
>> WE DON'T NEED A CONFESSION.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.842
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRIAL.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.645
>> THE SEARCH WARRANT TURNED UP
MOLOTOV COCKTAILS

26:18.678 --> 26:20.379
AND A BOX CUTTER.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.882
TRACES OF BLOOD ON IT
WILL MATCH MIRIAM'S DNA.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.685
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED?
>> IT'S NOT MY CASE.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.987
IMMIGRATION IS TAKING CUSTODY
OF SERUMAGA,

26:28.020 --> 26:30.189
AND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM
TO THE HAGUE FOR TRIAL.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.791
>> WHAT ABOUT JUSTICE
FOR MIRIAM?

26:31.824 --> 26:35.728
>> ICC IS GOING TO GET JUSTICE
FOR 10,000 MIRIAMS.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.866
[light knocking]

26:39.899 --> 26:42.835
>> MIRIAM?

26:42.869 --> 26:45.204
MIRIAM.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.741
WE HAVE GOOD NEWS.
>> WE FOUND ELIJAH.

26:48.775 --> 26:52.078
AND WE KNOW
THAT HE DIDN'T HURT YOU.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.948
MIRIAM, BUT HE TOLD US
ABOUT THE DEVIL...

26:55.982 --> 26:57.183
JOSEPH SERUMAGA.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.118
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.854
HE WILL NEVER,
EVER HURT YOU AGAIN.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.389
>> MIRIAM...

27:03.422 --> 27:07.827
THAT MAN WILL SPEND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON.

27:10.462 --> 27:14.100
>> NO, NO!
ABSOLUTELY NOT, MIRIAM.

27:14.133 --> 27:18.404
>> WHAT--WHAT IS SHE SAYING?
>> SHE WANTS TO GO SEE HIM.

27:18.437 --> 27:21.974
>> ARE YOU SURE?

27:24.076 --> 27:26.779
>> I STILL THINK
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.715
>> IT'S HER CHOICE, ONDINE.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.986
>> ARE YOU READY?

28:31.410 --> 28:35.114
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.757
>> THERE'S SOMEONE IN
THE SQUAD ROOM WAITIN' FOR YOU.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.962
>> MY LITTLE SISTER.

28:49.996 --> 28:54.300
I'M SORRY I WASN'T THERE
TO PROTECT YOU.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.002
I LOVE YOU TOO.

28:56.035 --> 28:59.872
>> MIRIAM.
I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.808
>> OF COURSE HE'S COMING
WITH US.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.876
YOU TWO HAVE CHOIR PRACTICE
THIS AFTERNOON.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.847
NO EXCUSES.
YOU CAN STILL LEARN THE MUSIC.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.552
>> THANK YOU.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.455
>> ELLIOT.

29:16.488 --> 29:19.025
THIS IS REGIONAL DIRECTOR
BRETT TRASK

29:19.058 --> 29:21.127
OF IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS
ENFORCEMENT.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.395
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
FINE WORK, DETECTIVE.

29:23.429 --> 29:26.132
CATCHING SERUMAGA
WAS A HUGE COUP.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.433
>> GLAD WE COULD HELP YOU OUT.

29:27.466 --> 29:28.868
>> JUST MAKE SURE
THAT DIRECTOR TRASK

29:28.901 --> 29:30.837
GETS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS.

29:30.870 --> 29:31.938
>> NO, NO, WE'RE ALL SET.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.439
I'VE GOT THE TRANSFER
OF CUSTODY,

29:33.472 --> 29:35.407
AND ADA CABOT TURNED OVER
YOUR DD-FIVES,

29:35.441 --> 29:37.276
SO...WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.079
NEXT STOP FOR MR. SERUMAGA,
THE HAGUE.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.347
OH...

29:41.380 --> 29:45.017
BY THE WAY, IS ELIJAH OKELLO
STILL IN CUSTODY?

29:45.051 --> 29:47.419
>> HE'S BEEN CLEARED.
WE RELEASED HIM.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.856
>> OH, THAT'S OKAY.
WE'LL PICK HIM UP.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.223
>> PICK HIM UP?
WHY?

29:51.257 --> 29:53.259
>> WELL, HIS ASYLUM CLAIM
WAS DENIED LAST YEAR.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.562
WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR HIS DEPORTATION.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.398
>> YOU'RE SENDING HIM BACK
TO UGANDA?

29:59.431 --> 30:02.268
>> HE'S A WAR CRIMINAL,
SAME AS SERUMAGA.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.470
BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT,
ELIJAH DIDN'T FLEE THE LRA

30:04.503 --> 30:06.873
UNTIL AFTER HIS 18th BIRTHDAY.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.375
HE WAS AN ADULT, AND THAT MAKES
HIM ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS ACTIONS.

30:09.408 --> 30:12.544
>> HE WAS A CHILD.
HE WAS FORCED TO DO WHAT HE DID.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.580
>> YOU'RE A NEW YORK CITY COP.
STICK TO YOUR BEAT.

30:14.613 --> 30:17.383
LEAVE THE WAR CRIMES TO ME.

30:22.621 --> 30:23.856
>> THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, ELLIOT.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.157
THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE RULED

30:25.191 --> 30:26.458
THAT ELIJAH'S LEGALLY
BARRED FROM ASYLUM.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.027
HE WAS STILL FIGHTING
WITH THE LRA AS AN ADULT.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.628
>> THEY ABDUCTED HIM
WHEN HE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD!

30:29.661 --> 30:31.630
>> AND HE SPENT THE NEXT DECADE
MURDERING CIVILIANS

30:31.663 --> 30:32.598
AND TORCHING VILLAGES.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.266
>> ELIJAH NEVER LIED
ABOUT WHAT HE'D DONE.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.968
IF HE HAD REFUSED,
THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.236
>> IF HE'D LEFT SOONER,

30:37.269 --> 30:38.470
HE'D BE ABLE TO STAY
IN THE UNITED STATES.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.206
>> YOU THINK THEY THREW HIM
A BIRTHDAY PARTY IN THE JUNGLE?

30:40.239 --> 30:42.008
DO YOU THINK HE EVEN KNEW
HE WAS 18 YEARS OLD?

30:42.041 --> 30:45.244
ALEX, THIS ISN'T ABOUT AGE...
THIS IS ABOUT A LITTLE BOY

30:45.277 --> 30:47.113
WHO SAW HIS MOTHER BUTCHERED
IN FRONT OF HIS EYES.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.614
IT'S ABOUT A BOY
WHO WAS ABDUCTED,

30:48.647 --> 30:52.151
HE WAS BRAINWASHED, HE WAS
FORCED TO COMMIT ATROCITIES.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.854
NOW, IF ELIJAH'S NOT A SPECIAL
VICTIM, YOU TELL ME WHO IS.

30:58.925 --> 31:01.393
>> THE SUPREME COURT SAYS THAT
U.N. GUIDELINES SHOULD BE USED

31:01.427 --> 31:03.195
TO DETERMINE REFUGEE STATUS.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.463
>> SO BY YOUR STANDARDS,

31:04.496 --> 31:05.564
IS ELIJAH A PERPETRATOR
OR A VICTIM?

31:05.597 --> 31:08.567
>> A VICTIM. HIS ACTIONS
WERE COMMITTED UNDER DURESS.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.537
HE WAS STILL A CAPTIVE
OF THE LRA WHEN HE TURNED 18.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.539
>> SO HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIS ACTIONS

31:13.572 --> 31:15.341
FROM THE TIME HE WAS
ABDUCTED AS A CHILD

31:15.374 --> 31:18.044
UNTIL HE REACHED SAFETY
AT THE KAKUMA REFUGEE CAMP.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.678
>> WHICH IS WHY THE
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT

31:19.711 --> 31:21.547
WOULDN'T PROSECUTE ELIJAH
ON WAR CRIMES.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.415
>> BUT THE UNITED STATES
IS TRYING TO DEPORT HIM.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.684
CAN'T YOU INTERCEDE
ON HIS BEHALF?

31:25.717 --> 31:28.654
>> THE U.N. RESPECTS THE LAWS
OF SOVEREIGN NATIONS.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.289
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T TRUMP
A U.S. COURT.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.091
>> BUT THEY'LL LISTEN TO YOU.
>> IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

31:32.124 --> 31:35.227
THE U.S. HASN'T EVEN RATIFIED
THE ROME TREATY ON WAR CRIMES.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.396
>> AS SOON AS IMMIGRATION
FINDS HIM,

31:37.429 --> 31:39.999
THEY ARE GOING
TO DEPORT HIM.

31:40.032 --> 31:43.335
>> UNLESS HE'S SOMEWHERE
THEY CAN'T TOUCH HIM.

31:43.369 --> 31:44.536
>> SANCTUARY?

31:44.570 --> 31:46.038
>> IT'S HAPPENING
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.573
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS
IN FEAR OF DEPORTATION

31:47.606 --> 31:49.075
SEEK SANCTUARY IN A CHURCH.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.576
THE FEDS AREN'T GOING
TO DRAG THEM OUT.

31:50.609 --> 31:51.577
YOU'VE GOT
A SYMPATHETIC PRIEST--

31:51.610 --> 31:54.146
>> SO INSTEAD OF SITTING
IN AN IMMIGRATION JAIL,

31:54.180 --> 31:55.982
ELIJAH'S A PRISONER
AT ST. ADRIAN'S.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.583
>> WELL, IT GIVES US TIME
TO FILE AN APPEAL.
[cell phone rings]

31:57.616 --> 31:59.285
AND IT BEATS BEING
SENT BACK TO UGANDA.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.687
FRANKLY, IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY,
I DON'T SEE IT.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.056
FIN, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

32:04.090 --> 32:06.358
YEAH.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.196
MEET YOU AT ST. ADRIAN'S.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.663
>> YOU GONNA BREAK THE NEWS
TO ELIJAH?

32:11.697 --> 32:13.032
>> IT'S ALREADY BEEN BROKEN.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.566
THE FEDS TRACKED HIM DOWN
TO ST. ADRIAN'S,

32:14.600 --> 32:16.602
AND THEY SERVED HIM
THE DEPORTATION NOTICE.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.070
>> AND HE FLIPPED OUT.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.438
>> HE GRABBED
AN I.C.E. AGENT'S GUN.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.640
HE'S HOLDING HOSTAGES.

32:21.673 --> 32:25.311
[sirens]

32:33.485 --> 32:36.388
LOOKS LIKE MY PAL AGENT TRASK
IS RUNNIN' THE SHOW.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.557
>> I'M SURPRISED HE HASN'T
NUKED THE CHURCH ALREADY.

32:38.590 --> 32:39.725
>> YEAH, ROGER THAT.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.727
YOUR BOY REALLY
SCREWED THE POOCH.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.096
>> MY BOY? HOW 'BOUT
YOUR AGENT WHO LET ELIJAH

32:44.130 --> 32:45.597
SNATCH HIS SERVICE WEAPON?

32:45.631 --> 32:47.733
>> YEAH, HE'LL BE DISCIPLINED.
AFTER WE CONTAIN THE SITUATION.

32:47.766 --> 32:48.834
>> RUN IT DOWN.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.037
>> INSIDE THE CHURCH YOU GOT
THE TAKER, THE PRIEST,

32:51.070 --> 32:53.405
AND 13 KIDS
FROM THE YOUTH CHOIR.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.773
REPORTERS ARE LOVIN' THIS.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.243
>> ANY COMMUNICATION?
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE A CELL PHONE.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.445
HE'S NOT RESPONDING
TO THE LOUD HAIL.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.579
>> LET US TALK TO HIM.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.780
>> SWAT ALREADY
HAS AN ATTACK PLAN.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.649
IT DOESN'T INCLUDE YOU.

33:03.682 --> 33:04.716
>> HEY, HEY, LISTEN TO ME.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.086
YOU'RE GONNA THROW
A FLASH BANG INSIDE A CHURCH,

33:07.119 --> 33:09.088
HOPING YOU DON'T KILL
A BUNCH OF KIDS ON LIVE TV?

33:09.121 --> 33:11.290
>> WHERE'S YOUR NEGOTIATOR?
>> HE'S EN ROUTE.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.092
>> LET US TALK HIM DOWN.
>> NEGATIVE, DETECTIVE.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.427
THIS IS A FEDERAL OPERATION!
>> GIVE US A CHANCE!

33:15.461 --> 33:18.097
20 MINUTES.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.066
20 MINUTES.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.400
>> I'LL GIVE YOU 10.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.636
THEN I'M LETTING MY DOGS
OFF THE LEASH.

33:30.109 --> 33:33.445
>> ELIJAH, IT'S DETECTIVES
STABLER AND TUTUOLA!

33:33.479 --> 33:35.481
>> GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR!

33:35.514 --> 33:39.185
>> WE'RE UNARMED.
WE JUST WANNA TALK.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.796
>> ELIJAH, THIS ISN'T THE WAY.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.165
>> WHEN IMMIGRATION CAME,

33:53.199 --> 33:55.534
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD
CALL ME A HERO

33:55.567 --> 33:58.337
FOR BRINGING THE DEVIL OF GULU
TO JUSTICE!

33:58.370 --> 33:59.505
I WAS A FOOL!

33:59.538 --> 34:01.373
>> ONLY IF YOU DON'T
END THIS NOW.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.742
>> IT'S ALREADY ENDING.
READ THEIR PAPERS.

34:03.775 --> 34:07.313
THEY CALL ME UNDESIRABLE
FOR RESIDENCY IN THE U.S.,

34:07.346 --> 34:08.814
A WAR CRIMINAL
WHO CHOSE TO KILL...

34:08.847 --> 34:10.216
LIKE SERUMAGA!

34:10.249 --> 34:12.851
>> SHOW THEM
THAT THEY'RE WRONG, SON.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.121
>> NO. NO!
THEY CALL ME A MONSTER!

34:15.154 --> 34:18.257
I WILL SHOW THEM A MONSTER!

34:18.290 --> 34:22.328
>> LET THE CHILDREN GO.

34:22.361 --> 34:23.729
THEY'RE INNOCENT.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.198
YOU KNOW THAT BETTER
THAN ANYBODY.

34:29.501 --> 34:34.140
>> TAKE THEM OUTSIDE!
>> COME WITH ME.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.307
>> GO!

34:35.341 --> 34:37.109
OH, DON'T--
>> NO, NO.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.644
LITTLE SISTER, GO.
GO.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.447
>> LISTEN TO HIM.
WE'LL BE FINE.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.150
NOW, GO...GO.
[coughing]

34:46.652 --> 34:49.521
>> HOLD YOUR POSITIONS!
HOLD YOUR POSITIONS!

34:49.555 --> 34:51.823
DETECTIVE TUTUOLA
AND 13 FRIENDLIES EXITING.

34:51.857 --> 34:55.661
COME ON!

34:55.694 --> 34:57.563
COME ON, COME ON.
BE CAREFUL, COME ON!

35:04.770 --> 35:07.206
>> MIRIAM!

35:07.239 --> 35:08.507
AND MY HUSBAND.

35:08.540 --> 35:12.478
>> ELIJAH'S NOT READY YET.
COME ON.

35:12.511 --> 35:16.248
>> ELIJAH, GIMME THE GUN.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.649
>> I NEED IT.
>> FOR WHAT?

35:17.683 --> 35:19.551
YOU GONNA KILL FATHER THEO?
YOU GONNA KILL ME?

35:19.585 --> 35:22.254
>> FOR MYSELF.
>> SUICIDE IS A MORTAL SIN.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.722
YOU RISK YOUR SOUL.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.892
>> I HAVE NO SOUL!
>> YOU DO.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.660
YEAH, YOU DO.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.662
>> WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

35:30.696 --> 35:34.333
>> HOPE BROUGHT YOU TO AMERICA.
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.468
>> AT KAKUMA, THEY PROMISED ME

35:36.502 --> 35:39.271
THAT IF I WENT TO SCHOOL
AND STUDIED HARD

35:39.305 --> 35:42.474
AND LEARNED TO BE A GOOD MAN,

35:42.508 --> 35:43.909
THERE WAS A LIFE FOR ME.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.512
I HAD IT...
AND IT IS GONE NOW!

35:46.545 --> 35:50.482
THEY'RE GOING TO SEND ME BACK
TO THE MURDER AND THE DEATH

35:50.516 --> 35:51.883
AND THE HUNGER.

35:51.917 --> 35:55.921
THE LRA WILL HUNT ME DOWN
AND KILL ME!

35:59.458 --> 36:01.427
I DESERVE TO DIE
FOR WHAT I'VE DONE.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.761
>> YOU WERE A CHILD THEN.
YOU WERE A CHILD.

36:02.794 --> 36:03.962
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER!

36:03.995 --> 36:06.965
THEY HAVE JUDGED ME
FOR WHAT A CHILD DID!

36:06.998 --> 36:08.934
>> NO, MAN'S JUDGMENT
DOES NOT MATTER, ONLY GOD'S!

36:08.967 --> 36:10.469
>> GOD HAS FORSAKEN ME!

36:10.502 --> 36:12.771
>> NEVER.
>> THEN WHERE IS HE, HUH?

36:12.804 --> 36:14.840
CAN HE HEAR THE SCREAMS
OF HIS CHILDREN?

36:14.873 --> 36:16.708
IS HE DEAF TO OUR SUFFERING?

36:16.742 --> 36:19.845
I HEAR IT AT NIGHT WHEN I SLEEP,

36:19.878 --> 36:21.813
EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES!

36:21.847 --> 36:27.286
>> NO, HIS SON
WAS IMPRISONED, TORTURED,

36:27.319 --> 36:31.223
AND KILLED.

36:31.257 --> 36:35.327
DO YOU NOT THINK
HE FEELS YOUR PAIN?

36:39.565 --> 36:43.802
>> OH...

36:43.835 --> 36:46.905
>> ALL RIGHT, JUST SIT BACK.
RELAX. HE NEEDS A DOCTOR.

36:49.575 --> 36:52.344
ELIJAH!

36:54.012 --> 36:55.781
TAKE HIM OUT.
>> NO!

36:55.814 --> 36:57.616
I'M NOT LEAVING.
>> YES, YOU ARE.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.951
LISTEN TO ME.

36:59.985 --> 37:04.222
WE DON'T GET HIM OUTTA HERE,
HE'S GONNA DIE.

37:07.359 --> 37:11.430
>> NOW, GIVE ME THE GUN.

37:22.308 --> 37:26.312
>> THEY SAID THE GUN
WAS OUR ONLY FRIEND...

37:26.345 --> 37:29.815
OUR MOTHER AND OUR FATHER.

37:29.848 --> 37:33.752
THAT IT WOULD MAKE US
FEEL STRONG.

37:33.785 --> 37:37.456
>> HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU
FEEL NOW?

37:41.460 --> 37:45.464
>> DIRTY.

37:49.801 --> 37:53.972
>> OKAY. OKAY.

37:56.041 --> 37:59.311
LET'S GO.

37:59.345 --> 38:02.381
COME ON.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.916
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO!

38:17.429 --> 38:20.699
>> IT'S DETECTIVE STABLER!
WE'RE COMIN' OUT!

38:20.732 --> 38:24.403
SUSPECT'S UNARMED.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.943
WE NEED EMS OVER HERE NOW!

38:48.427 --> 38:49.461
>> DON'T SHOOT!
>> NO, NO!

38:49.495 --> 38:51.830
>> DON'T SHOOT!
>> NO!

39:01.673 --> 39:04.710
>> LITTLE SISTER...

39:06.144 --> 39:10.015
[speaking faintly]

39:31.770 --> 39:33.805
>> THROUGH HIS HOLY ANOINTING,
MAY THE LORD

39:33.839 --> 39:37.476
IN HIS LOVE AND MERCY....

39:37.509 --> 39:40.078
>> MIRIAM, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HE SAID TO YOU?

39:42.514 --> 39:44.950
>> HE HAD TO DIE...

39:44.983 --> 39:48.754
TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE
ALL THE CHILD SOLDIERS.

40:15.481 --> 40:18.416
>> SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN.

40:27.225 --> 40:31.196
>> WHAT'S THE ANSWER, FATHER?

40:31.229 --> 40:36.234
>> TELL ELIJAH'S STORY.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.471
PRAY SOMEONE WILL LISTEN.
