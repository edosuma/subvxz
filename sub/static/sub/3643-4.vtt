00:02.469 --> 00:05.349
What to do when a bunch
of data you want to destroy

00:05.350 --> 00:07.140
is completely off the grid?

00:08.320 --> 00:11.620
Hello, Evil Corp. We are FSociety.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.129
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

00:15.130 --> 00:16.010
Dark Army?

00:16.011 --> 00:17.719
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

00:17.720 --> 00:19.589
Terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia...

00:19.590 --> 00:21.609
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

00:21.610 --> 00:22.760
Please buy my CD.

00:22.770 --> 00:24.389
He has my bank account, Ollie.

00:24.390 --> 00:27.965
We cannot just infect Allsafe's
network because of this.

00:28.017 --> 00:29.906
Can we please hear the plan?

00:29.940 --> 00:31.874
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

00:31.909 --> 00:33.209
I know how to take out the backups

00:33.243 --> 00:35.122
without blowing up the pipeline.

00:36.914 --> 00:39.148
What do normal people do
when they get this sad?

00:39.182 --> 00:42.118
They reach out to friends or family.

00:42.152 --> 00:43.352
I do morphine.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.315 --> 01:12.648
There it is.

01:12.683 --> 01:15.251
After all the searching, scraping, dusting,

01:15.285 --> 01:17.019
that's all that's left.

01:17.054 --> 01:20.323
One line. The last line.

01:20.357 --> 01:23.192
The consequences of busting
Vera and meeting Mr. Robot,

01:23.226 --> 01:27.129
creating you... everything
till now, this moment.

01:27.164 --> 01:30.366
I chose this. I chose all this.

01:34.171 --> 01:36.772
Data storage facilities
like Steel Mountain...

01:36.807 --> 01:40.176
it's linear-tape open standard 9.

01:40.210 --> 01:42.945
Temp value between 61 and 95.

01:42.980 --> 01:44.647
Iron oxide in mag tape...

01:44.681 --> 01:47.717
it sticks to polyurethane with a binder.

01:54.558 --> 01:58.894
If HVAC conditions surpass
the ceiling 95 degrees,

01:58.929 --> 02:02.598
polyurethane adhesive mollifies
and tape data is unreadable.

02:24.054 --> 02:25.821
This is what we're doing.

02:25.856 --> 02:29.225
This circuit board, if
installed behind a thermostat,

02:29.259 --> 02:31.694
it lets us plant an asymmetric back door

02:31.728 --> 02:35.498
then create a VPN in the
Steel Mountain intranet.

02:35.532 --> 02:38.334
Okay, we all know what a Raspberry Pi is.

02:38.368 --> 02:39.902
What's your point?

02:42.072 --> 02:43.773
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's

02:43.807 --> 02:45.074
climate control system,

02:45.108 --> 02:47.243
raise the facility's heat high enough

02:47.277 --> 02:50.112
to destroy all the tapes.

02:50.147 --> 02:52.181
And you think sticking
this behind the thermostat

02:52.215 --> 02:55.117
will do all that?

02:55.152 --> 02:57.686
With the right software
specifically designed.

02:57.721 --> 02:59.555
I'll pull up my research on the facility,

02:59.589 --> 03:00.923
start targeting which thermostats

03:00.957 --> 03:02.391
are the most accessible.

03:02.426 --> 03:03.793
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,

03:03.827 --> 03:05.961
but we still gotta get in the damn joint.

03:07.798 --> 03:10.433
There. Deep in the Adirondacks.

03:10.467 --> 03:13.769
In 145-plus acre former limestone mine.

03:13.804 --> 03:18.307
3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards,

03:18.341 --> 03:21.710
closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing.

03:21.745 --> 03:24.113
Sure you don't want to just blow it up?

03:29.486 --> 03:32.755
All we need is one security flaw.

03:32.789 --> 03:36.258
Look at this place, man. It
was built not to have any.

03:38.095 --> 03:41.664
I see about... six walking around.

03:49.306 --> 03:52.441
You okay, man?

03:55.445 --> 03:57.012
What the hell?

03:57.047 --> 03:59.181
Where you going?

03:59.216 --> 04:02.084
We're done, aren't we?

04:02.119 --> 04:04.854
That was about the time
the withdrawal started.

04:04.888 --> 04:06.155
Remember?

04:10.327 --> 04:12.995
I know... I broke my own rule.

04:13.029 --> 04:14.930
But I have no Suboxone.

04:14.965 --> 04:18.834
What I do have... clinical
depression, social anxiety.

04:18.869 --> 04:22.371
A day job, a night job,
confusing relationships.

04:22.405 --> 04:24.473
Others depending on me.

04:24.508 --> 04:27.843
Taking down the largest
corporation in the world.

04:27.878 --> 04:29.011
And I chose it all.

04:30.714 --> 04:33.616
This line has wanted
to own me my whole life.

04:33.650 --> 04:37.286
Biosynthesized in some lab
in Mexico, packed into a pill,

04:37.320 --> 04:39.288
shipped to the States where it was packaged

04:39.322 --> 04:41.624
with a logo and taxed by the government,

04:41.658 --> 04:44.493
stolen by a bribed guard,
sold to a Vera henchman,

04:44.528 --> 04:47.663
oversold to Shayla, and then to me.

04:47.697 --> 04:51.133
It needs me just as much as I need it.

04:51.168 --> 04:53.502
The moment was destined,
every choice bringing me

04:53.537 --> 04:55.708
closer to this one line.

04:55.742 --> 04:58.844
This line. This last line.

04:59.778 --> 05:01.179
I promise.

05:03.071 --> 05:05.940
- Synced and corrected by skøad -
www.addic7ed.com

05:10.156 --> 05:12.057
Today will be the worst of it.

05:12.092 --> 05:15.394
Get through the next couple
days, and then I'll be clean.

05:34.314 --> 05:36.648
What do you want?

05:41.588 --> 05:43.255
Huh?

06:09.556 --> 06:13.106
It's me. Open up.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.259
I would have saved you the trip to the door

06:17.293 --> 06:20.295
but you're all, like, against
me breaking in or whatever.

06:24.333 --> 06:25.834
Why are you here?

06:25.868 --> 06:27.803
Romero got some clarity on your little plan

06:27.837 --> 06:29.337
that's gonna need your undivided.

06:30.773 --> 06:34.109
- Okay, let's go.
- What's going on with you?

06:34.143 --> 06:35.544
You look like shit.

06:36.846 --> 06:38.647
I'm fine.

06:47.590 --> 06:51.793
Look, man. This plan's not gonna work.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.629
Why? Why is that?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.164
I was doing recon on Steel Mountain.

06:56.199 --> 06:57.666
Came up with a problem. A big, fat one.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.836
Evil Corp's upping their security protocol.

07:00.870 --> 07:04.473
If you ask me, it's
overkill, but it's legit.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.741
I already told you, they
have their vulnerabilities.

07:06.776 --> 07:09.644
So what happens after we
hack the New York facility?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.480
Then we have to take a trip to Nashville,

07:11.514 --> 07:13.949
then Colorado, then San Jose,

07:13.983 --> 07:16.318
then goddamn Tallahassee.

07:18.254 --> 07:20.889
Ugh, this looks real bad. Real bad.

07:20.923 --> 07:22.958
They are physically copying then shipping

07:22.992 --> 07:24.726
all the analog backups.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.729
Five big-ass fortress-like
redundancies across the country.

07:27.763 --> 07:30.632
Now maybe... and it was
always a big maybe...

07:30.666 --> 07:32.801
we get into one, but no
way we get into all of them.

07:32.835 --> 07:35.237
The minute we fry one facility,

07:35.271 --> 07:38.473
they'll patch every climate
control system they own.

07:38.508 --> 07:40.842
No matter how you slice
it, the plan is DOA.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.711
Where'd you get this?

07:42.745 --> 07:44.045
What the hell do you mean?

07:44.080 --> 07:47.549
We're still in Evil Corp's network.

07:47.583 --> 07:50.318
Shit.

07:50.353 --> 07:52.754
This is what Tyrell was talking about.

07:52.788 --> 07:55.590
What'd you just say? Tyrell?

07:55.625 --> 07:58.426
As in Tyrell Wellick?

07:58.461 --> 08:00.996
Yeah.

08:01.030 --> 08:03.331
Since when did you and the goddamn CTO

08:03.366 --> 08:06.935
of Evil Corp become, what, chums?

08:06.969 --> 08:10.171
Says this isn't happening till April 1st.

08:10.206 --> 08:13.575
It's only the 29th.

08:13.609 --> 08:15.710
We still got a few days.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.846
We have time.

08:17.880 --> 08:21.049
All their tapes are still
in the New York facility.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.486
Just means we go up today.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.292
We're nowhere close to being ready.

08:30.326 --> 08:32.961
Well, I've already downloaded
all the necessary PDFs

08:32.995 --> 08:35.630
of the floor plans to
target the thermostats.

08:35.664 --> 08:36.865
It will require some planning,

08:36.899 --> 08:38.400
but nothing I can't do in the car.

08:39.215 --> 08:40.309
It shouldn't take me long to own

08:40.311 --> 08:41.570
the facility's SCADA network.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.972
Especially with some help.

08:44.006 --> 08:45.240
You guys hit the road

08:45.274 --> 08:47.709
while Trenton helps me finish the distro.

08:47.743 --> 08:49.411
We'll double-time it.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.446
You can get it off the FTP
server as soon as you get there.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.981
What about China?

08:53.015 --> 08:54.749
We'd have to execute
the hack before Tuesday.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.585
Don't worry about China.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.487
I'll it up my Dark Army
contact as soon as you take off.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.256
Oh, you just gonna hit up

09:01.290 --> 09:05.126
the world's most dangerous hacker crew?

09:05.161 --> 09:09.664
Pssh, ya'll have gone and
misplaced your collective minds.

09:09.699 --> 09:11.833
We've been planning this for months.

09:11.867 --> 09:14.235
Now we're gonna go up on a
lark just 'cause he said so?

09:14.270 --> 09:17.339
This plan is shit.

09:17.373 --> 09:19.140
The plan will work.

09:19.175 --> 09:21.476
And once we're actually
there, I still need to prep

09:21.510 --> 09:23.845
the social engineering,
plus we have no idea

09:23.879 --> 09:26.181
who physically's gonna go in.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.822
It's my plan. I'll go in.

09:33.856 --> 09:36.925
Look, man, you...

09:36.959 --> 09:38.526
you might be able to
hide it from these nerds,

09:38.561 --> 09:41.096
but I know a junkie when I see one.

09:41.130 --> 09:43.198
In your condition, you
ain't gonna do Jack or Jill

09:43.232 --> 09:44.766
except puke your brains out

09:44.800 --> 09:46.701
or give hand jobs for another high.

09:46.736 --> 09:50.305
Like you said, in three days,
one Steel Mountain becomes five.

09:50.339 --> 09:53.341
That's no good for any plan.

09:55.811 --> 09:57.879
Something ain't right about this guy.

09:57.913 --> 10:01.383
Yeah, well. He's gotten us this far.

10:01.417 --> 10:03.351
Still, I don't trust him.

10:03.386 --> 10:07.422
Well, it's not about trust, remember?

10:11.727 --> 10:13.561
Thank you, Mom.

10:18.601 --> 10:22.404
- There it is.
- All right.

10:22.438 --> 10:24.139
Come to Daddy.

10:31.213 --> 10:35.116
Yeah. Ha ha ha.

10:56.138 --> 10:59.207
Yo, man.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.910
You gonna say anything about this?

11:01.944 --> 11:03.211
What's there to say?

11:03.245 --> 11:05.680
You seem to have everything under control.

11:05.715 --> 11:07.982
Yeah. Okay.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.722
This isn't my operation.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.035
I told you before.

11:27.069 --> 11:29.104
You're the key to the whole thing.

11:29.138 --> 11:31.906
You're the only force
of nature at play here.

11:44.153 --> 11:46.921
There's a saying.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.723
The devil's at his strongest

11:48.758 --> 11:50.759
while we're looking the other way,

11:50.793 --> 11:53.928
like a program running in
the background silently,

11:53.963 --> 11:57.632
while we're busy doing other shit.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.601
Daemons, they call them.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.837
They perform action
without user interaction.

12:02.872 --> 12:07.308
Monitoring, logging, notifications.

12:07.343 --> 12:12.113
Primal urges, repressed
memories, unconscious habits.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.650
They're always there, always active.

12:15.684 --> 12:18.987
We can try to be right,
we can try to be good.

12:19.021 --> 12:20.922
We can try to make a difference,

12:20.956 --> 12:22.857
but it's all bullshit.

12:22.892 --> 12:25.026
'Cause intentions are irrelevant.

12:25.060 --> 12:28.263
They don't drive us. Daemons do.

12:28.297 --> 12:30.899
And me? I've got more than most.

12:34.961 --> 12:37.830
I just need to rest a
minute, okay? I'll be fine.

12:37.864 --> 12:39.531
Bullshit... a couple hours,

12:39.566 --> 12:41.690
you'll wish you felt as
shitty as you do right now.

12:41.691 --> 12:43.622
Wait till the convulsions start.

12:43.623 --> 12:47.155
Full body pains, leaking
from everywhere, then...

12:47.156 --> 12:48.940
Hypersensitivity to brightness and sound.

12:48.974 --> 12:50.908
After that, overwhelming paranoia

12:50.943 --> 12:52.977
followed by the darkest of depressions.

12:53.011 --> 12:55.146
Symptoms may persist for two weeks,

12:55.180 --> 12:58.416
assuming I last that long.

12:58.450 --> 13:00.084
Yeah, I know what's in store.

13:00.119 --> 13:01.753
Romero may have a point.

13:01.787 --> 13:04.956
You're not gonna be good for
anything till you kick this.

13:06.992 --> 13:09.927
I... it burns.

13:11.497 --> 13:13.164
Don't be mad at me.

13:13.198 --> 13:16.067
I know I slipped, but I'm
about to change the world.

13:16.901 --> 13:20.004
I'm about to change the world.

13:44.630 --> 13:46.430
Shit.

13:47.900 --> 13:52.470
Mm, that is the way I like
to get up in the morning.

13:52.504 --> 13:55.773
Screw coffee or breakfast in bed.

13:55.808 --> 13:57.508
The first thing I could see every day

13:57.543 --> 13:59.110
is that sweet butt of yours.

13:59.144 --> 14:02.113
I'd be the happiest dude in the city.

14:02.147 --> 14:04.282
Are you going somewhere, babe?

14:04.316 --> 14:06.851
Yeah, um, I'm gonna meet my dad for brunch.

14:06.885 --> 14:08.152
What? No, babe.

14:08.187 --> 14:10.488
I was gonna take you to brunch.

14:10.522 --> 14:13.825
I mean, I know that things are, like, okay

14:13.859 --> 14:15.860
between us right now, but I'm... I'm not

14:15.894 --> 14:18.329
gonna let myself off easy, all right?

14:18.363 --> 14:21.132
You will be wined, and you will be dined

14:21.166 --> 14:24.735
until I feel I've gotten
myself out of the doghouse.

14:24.770 --> 14:27.405
Well, we can do something tonight, then.

14:27.439 --> 14:29.140
Perfect.

14:29.174 --> 14:30.842
- Okay.
- No.

14:33.712 --> 14:36.214
Oh, hey.

14:36.248 --> 14:38.649
Is Elliot around? I tried texting him.

14:38.684 --> 14:40.318
Uh, he didn't text me back.

14:40.352 --> 14:41.652
Yeah, he's gone for the day,

14:41.687 --> 14:44.589
which is why I'm on Flipper duty.

14:44.623 --> 14:46.257
Where is he?

14:46.291 --> 14:47.658
Shit if I know.

14:47.693 --> 14:49.360
I mean, I don't ask details,

14:49.394 --> 14:53.064
but he only ever tells me
what he wants anyway, right?

14:53.098 --> 14:55.233
And I'll tell him you stopped by.

14:59.705 --> 15:03.107
Do you want to walk with us?

15:03.141 --> 15:06.244
Flipper loves an audience when she pees.

15:09.648 --> 15:12.283
Sure. Yeah. I gotta...

15:12.317 --> 15:14.051
head back towards the subway anyway.

15:14.086 --> 15:15.953
Oh, we don't plan our path.

15:15.988 --> 15:18.022
I mean, we just kind of wing it

15:18.056 --> 15:20.591
and see where the moment takes us.

15:20.626 --> 15:21.959
Come on.

15:21.994 --> 15:24.495
Come on, before she bursts.

15:28.901 --> 15:31.602
Maybe this was all intentional.

15:31.637 --> 15:33.971
My subconscious, running in the background,

15:34.006 --> 15:37.475
making me doubt what I got
everyone else to believe in.

15:37.509 --> 15:40.144
Turning me into the physical
manifestation of my fear

15:40.178 --> 15:41.312
of being a...

15:41.346 --> 15:42.947
Goddamn waste.

15:42.981 --> 15:44.749
Just give him a night to recover, okay?

15:44.783 --> 15:46.717
- We still have tomorrow.
- This shit'll last a week.

15:46.752 --> 15:48.819
And I refuse to waste
my time playing nurse.

15:48.854 --> 15:52.156
We gotta get back, regroup,
start devising a plan B.

15:53.992 --> 15:55.326
The rabbit is in the administration system.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.728
- Send a flu shot.
- Rabbit, flu shot...

15:57.763 --> 16:00.097
- Someone talk to me.
- A rabbit replicates

16:00.132 --> 16:03.000
till it overloads a file,
then it spreads like cancer.

16:03.035 --> 16:04.302
Cancer?

16:04.336 --> 16:05.670
Hollywood hacker bullshit.

16:05.704 --> 16:07.438
I been in this game 27 years.

16:07.472 --> 16:10.474
Not once have I ever come
across an animated singing virus.

16:10.509 --> 16:13.911
I have yet to fly through a
Tron City directory structure.

16:13.946 --> 16:16.147
I bet you right now some
writer's working hard

16:16.181 --> 16:19.452
on a TV show that'll mess
up this generation's idea

16:19.453 --> 16:22.971
of hacker culture.

16:55.470 --> 16:58.405
All you had to do is ask, klepto.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.499
I've updated the FTP.

17:01.508 --> 17:02.676
All the files are ready.

17:02.677 --> 17:05.144
- I've created...
- Any word from the road?

17:06.512 --> 17:08.815
Jesus, it's been a full 24 hours.

17:08.848 --> 17:10.750
Where the hell could they be?

17:12.252 --> 17:14.186
Got any Advil?

17:17.424 --> 17:19.992
I'm guessing you didn't make contact.

17:20.027 --> 17:21.724
Nope.

17:21.729 --> 17:24.097
Perhaps this plan was
a little too ambitious.

17:24.132 --> 17:26.532
We'll wait until the rest of them get back

17:26.568 --> 17:28.101
and then reevaluate.

17:28.136 --> 17:30.204
Sitting here helpless
while we crash and burn?

17:30.238 --> 17:31.505
Not my speed.

17:31.539 --> 17:33.240
Even if they hack into Steel Mountain,

17:33.274 --> 17:35.542
we need to hit China's
data centers simultaneously.

17:35.577 --> 17:37.010
If the Dark Army isn't compliant,

17:37.045 --> 17:39.713
then there's not much we can do.

17:41.982 --> 17:44.451
God... shit!

17:44.485 --> 17:46.553
I got so wasted, I forgot it's Sunday.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.121
I know where my guy will be.

17:48.155 --> 17:50.023
Is that wise?

17:50.057 --> 17:53.426
Those guys aren't known for
being the most understanding.

17:53.461 --> 17:54.861
I'm assuming if he wanted contact...

17:54.895 --> 17:57.130
What about what I want?

17:59.266 --> 18:00.633
I'm coming with you.

18:00.668 --> 18:02.235
No, thank you.

18:02.269 --> 18:05.071
You stick around, wait
for the boys to FTP it.

18:12.313 --> 18:13.913
Hey, Trenton.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.433
Here.

18:35.703 --> 18:38.338
- What is this?
- Come on, they're my last two.

18:40.474 --> 18:41.741
Is this ecstasy?

18:41.776 --> 18:43.576
No, it's clarity.

18:43.911 --> 18:47.180
It'll help you see past
whatever's bringing you down.

18:48.749 --> 18:50.249
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude.

18:50.284 --> 18:52.485
I... don't do drugs.

18:52.519 --> 18:54.712
- I mean, I... I smoke weed...
- Well, sorry,

18:54.713 --> 18:56.736
but there's no take-backs, so...

18:56.757 --> 18:59.125
Besides, don't you want
to figure your shit out?

19:00.962 --> 19:04.064
For me, sometimes when I'm
going through something,

19:04.098 --> 19:06.266
just gotta... I don't know.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.436
Forget about it for a little while.

19:48.309 --> 19:49.643
Are you seriously drinking

19:49.677 --> 19:51.778
a goddamn sparkling water right now?

19:51.812 --> 19:55.048
If you weren't wearing my
scarf, I'd kick your ass.

19:58.853 --> 20:00.854
I think we should go.

20:00.888 --> 20:04.858
Trust me... he's here every Sunday, okay?

20:04.892 --> 20:06.426
He'll show.

20:13.401 --> 20:15.235
Jesus Christ, Romero. What are we gonna do?

20:15.269 --> 20:17.003
We dump him at a hospital,

20:17.038 --> 20:18.905
come up with an alternative
course of action.

20:18.939 --> 20:21.675
- That's our only option.
- No. No hospital.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.543
Then we split. Screw it.

20:23.577 --> 20:25.345
I mean, you say it all the time yourself,

20:25.379 --> 20:27.080
there's casualties in every revolution.

20:27.114 --> 20:29.416
All that matters is the end result.

20:29.450 --> 20:31.084
We got no time to haul dead weight.

20:31.118 --> 20:33.119
Fine! You wanna leave, leave.

20:35.589 --> 20:37.524
Screw this, man.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.508
I need a hit.

20:55.543 --> 20:57.377
I'll be better.

20:57.411 --> 20:58.678
Just to get me through this.

20:58.713 --> 21:01.247
I can't let you do that.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.217
One hit.

21:04.251 --> 21:06.453
You know, just to get me back on the road.

21:06.487 --> 21:09.422
We don't have time. This...

21:09.457 --> 21:11.791
needs to happen now.

21:13.828 --> 21:14.828
One hit.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.728
Come on.

21:28.430 --> 21:30.298
Let's go.

21:33.769 --> 21:35.493
'Scuse me, fella.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.738
You lookin' for something?

21:37.739 --> 21:40.541
He could really use a helping hand.

21:40.576 --> 21:43.177
Yeah, okay, he can go in. But only him.

21:43.212 --> 21:46.013
Uh, no can do. I gotta come with.

21:46.048 --> 21:49.784
Only if you're partaking,
otherwise he goes it alone.

21:53.922 --> 21:55.923
Here you go.

21:55.958 --> 21:57.225
30.

21:57.259 --> 21:59.293
30.

22:01.296 --> 22:04.198
The guy in the house will set you up right.

22:04.233 --> 22:06.060
Long as he doesn't kill you.

22:10.005 --> 22:12.907
All right, look, the minute you're done...

22:12.941 --> 22:14.742
you leave.

22:14.777 --> 22:17.378
You don't look at anyone.
You don't talk to anyone.

22:17.412 --> 22:20.281
You take care of business and you get out.

22:20.315 --> 22:23.952
Hey. Nod if you understand.

22:54.449 --> 22:55.449
You want?

22:57.986 --> 22:59.787
Hey.

22:59.822 --> 23:02.190
Big eyes.

23:04.793 --> 23:07.128
It's all good, man. Go on.

23:07.162 --> 23:08.629
I just...

23:08.664 --> 23:10.865
I need morphine. Pills.

23:10.899 --> 23:12.300
No, man.

23:12.334 --> 23:14.936
This is all we got right here.

23:14.970 --> 23:17.638
It's better.

23:17.673 --> 23:19.807
Trust me.

23:22.978 --> 23:24.846
Go on.

23:24.848 --> 23:27.481
There you go. There you go.

23:27.516 --> 23:30.618
I'll help.

23:30.652 --> 23:34.155
It'll be okay. I'll help.

23:40.596 --> 23:42.864
Have I sunk this low?

23:42.898 --> 23:44.632
What must you think of me?

23:44.666 --> 23:47.168
Is it spring? Election year?

23:47.202 --> 23:49.170
Shall I hibernate?

23:49.204 --> 23:53.174
Did we meet? In money we trust.

23:53.208 --> 23:57.211
No, I created... stop.

23:57.246 --> 24:00.381
I can't control thoughts. I need this.

24:00.415 --> 24:03.517
I know I promised my last line, but...

24:16.531 --> 24:19.767
Greedy bitch!

24:30.245 --> 24:31.879
Aah!

24:31.914 --> 24:34.548
Shit, man...

24:38.887 --> 24:40.254
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

24:40.289 --> 24:43.357
here's that seven-day forecast
for the tri-state area.

24:43.392 --> 24:45.359
Lots of clouds today, but mostly sunny

24:45.394 --> 24:46.727
through Thursday with temperatures

24:46.762 --> 24:48.496
in the mid to the upper 80s.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.997
And you will notice that the humidity

24:50.032 --> 24:51.232
will be a tad uncomfortable.

24:52.901 --> 24:54.835
Dear brothers and sisters,

24:54.870 --> 24:56.938
now is the time to open your eyes.

24:56.972 --> 24:59.573
If you have not yet woken up to the reality

24:59.608 --> 25:02.443
of profiteering and enslavement
we've been warning you about,

25:02.477 --> 25:05.613
I hope you realize we are
fast running out of time.

25:05.647 --> 25:08.616
The governments of the world
and their corporate masters

25:08.650 --> 25:10.451
do not want us to speak.

25:10.485 --> 25:13.120
Why? Because we unlock truths.

25:13.155 --> 25:16.223
We expose villains. We exorcize demons.

25:16.258 --> 25:18.592
Citizens of the world, we are here to help.

25:18.627 --> 25:21.562
If you have any interest
in waking from your slumber,

25:21.596 --> 25:24.565
in retrieving lost,
damaged, or stolen memory,

25:24.599 --> 25:26.434
we are here for you.

25:26.468 --> 25:29.236
We have your back. We are FSociety.

25:58.633 --> 26:00.801
What's it open?

26:03.672 --> 26:05.840
It belongs to you now.

26:05.874 --> 26:07.942
Made in the Orient.

26:07.976 --> 26:10.478
Made just for your head.

26:15.484 --> 26:18.652
Now, find your monster, then turn the key.

26:18.687 --> 26:20.187
But first...

26:20.222 --> 26:22.656
a word from our corporate overlords!

26:24.287 --> 26:27.222
If you see our logo, that
means you can rest assured

26:27.256 --> 26:28.840
that you're buying the best food,

26:28.841 --> 26:30.191
clothing, shelter,

26:30.226 --> 26:32.724
transportation, hygiene, electronics,

26:32.761 --> 26:35.062
and life's necessities that money can buy.

27:23.778 --> 27:25.879
Hello.

27:25.913 --> 27:27.747
Hello, friend.

27:29.350 --> 27:31.418
But we're not friends.

27:33.421 --> 27:37.357
Can you tell me what
happened to that house?

27:39.427 --> 27:41.761
First can you tell me? What's your monster?

27:48.236 --> 27:50.871
I think you dropped this.

28:06.821 --> 28:08.688
♪ Ding dong ding ♪

28:08.723 --> 28:11.658
♪ Ding dong ding ♪

28:20.568 --> 28:23.603
Don't be shy now.

28:23.638 --> 28:26.973
You can come closer.

28:32.780 --> 28:35.248
Unsettling, I know.

28:35.283 --> 28:38.084
Your pet beta fish chatting you up.

28:38.119 --> 28:40.754
But time's money, Elliot.

28:40.788 --> 28:43.456
You need something?

28:43.491 --> 28:45.759
Your water... does it need changing?

28:45.793 --> 28:49.729
When you live in a fishbowl,
ain't no such thing as change.

28:49.764 --> 28:52.165
My entire life's been spent in this thing.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.768
My whole world's on your side table.

28:54.802 --> 28:58.572
I look around... same shit, different day.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.173
The lighting, the furniture.

29:00.208 --> 29:02.676
Even the sounds... always the same.

29:02.710 --> 29:04.110
I'm on a loop,

29:04.145 --> 29:06.746
and it won't stop unless my life does.

29:06.781 --> 29:10.650
I'm exhausted with this world.

29:10.685 --> 29:12.852
What can I do? I wanna help.

29:12.887 --> 29:14.821
I think it's pretty obvious.

29:14.855 --> 29:17.157
There's really only one thing you can do

29:17.191 --> 29:19.759
for a brother in a fishbowl.

29:19.794 --> 29:20.994
What is it?

29:21.028 --> 29:25.365
Move him to a goddamn window!

29:38.913 --> 29:42.649
Angela, he's my friend.

29:42.683 --> 29:44.851
Yes.

29:44.885 --> 29:47.554
And he's delicious.

29:49.824 --> 29:51.358
Here.

30:00.168 --> 30:01.435
- Eat this.
- Mm-mm.

30:01.569 --> 30:02.703
Open.

30:13.948 --> 30:17.384
It's piping hot, so consume with caution.

30:17.418 --> 30:19.419
Pop's famous raspberry pie.

30:19.453 --> 30:20.787
Enjoy.

30:33.067 --> 30:34.267
Mm...

30:39.273 --> 30:40.907
Yes.

30:40.941 --> 30:42.509
Yes!

30:42.543 --> 30:45.578
Yes, Elliot, I do.

30:47.915 --> 30:49.916
Elliot, I do!

30:49.950 --> 30:52.519
I do!

31:41.269 --> 31:43.781
Those people in there...

31:46.140 --> 31:48.608
I just told them what they wanted to hear.

31:52.346 --> 31:54.714
You're not gonna do it, are you?

31:56.650 --> 31:59.486
Change the world.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.756
Figures. You were only born a month ago.

32:04.458 --> 32:08.261
You're afraid.

32:08.295 --> 32:10.997
Afraid of your monster.

32:11.031 --> 32:13.166
Do you even know what it is?

32:18.139 --> 32:21.141
It doesn't fit.

32:26.247 --> 32:29.449
Why not?

32:29.483 --> 32:31.418
Isn't it obvious?

32:32.920 --> 32:36.289
You're not Elliot.

32:36.323 --> 32:37.290
You're the...

32:42.029 --> 32:44.397
Hello?

32:45.499 --> 32:46.699
Hello?

33:06.954 --> 33:08.922
Am I still alone?

33:08.956 --> 33:11.491
Is this the face of my only friend?

33:11.525 --> 33:13.293
Are you my monster?

33:16.797 --> 33:20.266
I am here. You are alone.

33:33.481 --> 33:36.716
They all left.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.952
They all left.

33:41.622 --> 33:43.790
They all left.

33:46.093 --> 33:48.061
I'm alone.

33:51.065 --> 33:52.532
I'm alone.

33:54.335 --> 33:56.903
I'm alone.

33:57.437 --> 33:59.338
No, you're not.

34:05.746 --> 34:08.335
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

34:08.735 --> 34:11.951
We're in this to the end.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.417
Maybe you should just walk. Ballet seems

34:25.418 --> 34:26.824
out of your skill set.

34:26.826 --> 34:29.054
What? Screw you, young'un!

34:29.056 --> 34:31.329
This bitch can plié with the best of 'em.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.664
You know, when I'm not
bangin' on a keyboard,

34:33.699 --> 34:36.033
I'm schooling classmates
with moves like this!

34:38.337 --> 34:39.603
Ooh!

34:39.638 --> 34:41.739
Good lookin' out.

34:53.552 --> 34:55.985
I'm sorry he never came.

35:00.692 --> 35:02.159
Let's... let's just go.

35:02.594 --> 35:06.497
I am a menace to society!

35:10.568 --> 35:12.269
What?

35:12.303 --> 35:14.471
- Wait, where are you going?
- It's him.

35:51.543 --> 35:53.977
Phone. Now!

35:54.012 --> 35:55.979
Come on.

36:21.471 --> 36:24.440
Why am I still out?

36:24.474 --> 36:25.942
I have to be at work

36:25.976 --> 36:28.511
in four hours!

36:28.545 --> 36:32.515
There's a lot I'm gonna
miss about this gig.

36:32.549 --> 36:35.551
What are you gonna do for money now?

36:35.585 --> 36:38.788
Oh, you know. Just be a hottie waitress.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.057
I'm, uh... Oh, thank you.

36:41.091 --> 36:42.491
Glad you liked it.

36:42.526 --> 36:43.993
Thanks.

36:44.027 --> 36:46.395
Although I am glad I got in one last hurrah

36:46.430 --> 36:47.964
before going all corporate.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.666
You're not worried?

36:50.701 --> 36:53.169
Worried about what?

36:53.203 --> 36:54.704
I don't know.

36:54.738 --> 36:57.406
I always get worried
before starting a new job.

36:57.441 --> 37:01.143
No. I am definitely not worried.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.912
Worry's a waste of time.

37:02.946 --> 37:06.045
I mean, shit didn't work out
at one job, so I got another.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.480
That's all!

37:09.383 --> 37:10.984
You worry a lot, don't you?

37:14.889 --> 37:15.889
Yeah.

37:41.349 --> 37:43.350
Look in the mirror.

37:48.690 --> 37:49.990
See that badass bitch?

37:52.193 --> 37:55.696
That's the only person you
should ever worry about.

38:27.094 --> 38:29.580
Do you know how hard it's
been for me to find you?

38:33.601 --> 38:35.301
Come here.

38:35.336 --> 38:37.804
Yo, you need to chill.

38:37.838 --> 38:40.306
Go to hell, asshole!

38:41.375 --> 38:43.443
There she is.

38:43.477 --> 38:46.646
A ray of sunshine in the
dark void of my existence.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.348
Oh, poetic.

38:48.382 --> 38:49.749
But not an apology.

38:49.783 --> 38:52.485
I ain't apologizing for shit.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.687
Oh, this is because I dumped your ass.

38:54.722 --> 38:57.324
For real? You're gonna
start pissing me off.

38:57.426 --> 38:58.911
Sorry I wanted to spend my life with you.

38:58.912 --> 38:59.993
What a monster I am.

39:00.228 --> 39:02.562
Things are happening, Cisco.

39:02.597 --> 39:04.631
We need to go tomorrow.

39:04.665 --> 39:05.799
It's our only shot.

39:05.833 --> 39:08.168
Then you never had one.

39:08.202 --> 39:10.237
Look, I'm serious, Darlene.

39:10.271 --> 39:12.172
These guys don't mess around.

39:12.206 --> 39:14.007
Now, whatever it is you
think you're doing...

39:14.041 --> 39:15.508
freeing the world, freeing the masses...

39:15.543 --> 39:17.010
the guys I work for,

39:17.044 --> 39:19.212
they ain't motivated by
kumbaya shit like that.

39:19.247 --> 39:22.148
All right? Now, I'm warning you...

39:22.183 --> 39:23.950
for the last time.

39:28.789 --> 39:31.024
Oh, come on.

39:48.576 --> 39:53.013
You know how much this means to me.

39:53.047 --> 39:55.915
Please...

39:55.950 --> 39:58.451
just talk to them.

40:05.159 --> 40:08.528
My Aunt Esther cured all
her habits with this...

40:08.562 --> 40:11.531
liquid anti-diarrheal
for the... well, you know.

40:11.565 --> 40:14.367
Lemon and salt for the electrolytes,

40:14.402 --> 40:16.536
decongestant for the runny nose.

40:16.570 --> 40:18.371
This is the third one.

40:18.406 --> 40:20.106
Seven more, you'll be good as new.

40:26.614 --> 40:28.548
I'ma go pull the van around.

40:28.582 --> 40:30.417
Make sure he keeps chugging those.

40:31.786 --> 40:33.920
Thanks.

40:35.256 --> 40:36.289
Cool.

40:38.292 --> 40:39.659
Hello again.

40:39.694 --> 40:41.494
Long time no...

40:41.529 --> 40:43.763
whatever it is we do.

40:43.798 --> 40:46.800
I missed you. Where did you go?

40:46.834 --> 40:49.436
Did you leave, or did I?

40:59.814 --> 41:01.481
Maybe it was both.

41:01.515 --> 41:04.751
Or neither. Doesn't matter.

41:21.068 --> 41:24.003
Do those hopeful moments scare me?

41:24.038 --> 41:27.207
Of course. Daemons, remember?

41:34.014 --> 41:37.050
At some point an "action
without user interaction"

41:37.084 --> 41:40.453
will come along and sweep my legs.

41:40.488 --> 41:43.223
This spinning wheel of
false highs and true lows

41:43.257 --> 41:45.058
will continue.

41:45.092 --> 41:46.693
That much I know.

43:49.479 --> 43:52.181
Daemons... they don't stop working.

43:52.215 --> 43:53.682
They're always active.

43:57.021 --> 43:59.756
They seduce. They manipulate.

43:59.790 --> 44:01.891
They own us.

44:05.630 --> 44:08.031
And even though you're with me,

44:08.065 --> 44:11.201
even though I created you,
it makes no difference.

44:11.235 --> 44:12.936
We all must deal with them alone.

44:12.970 --> 44:15.005
The best we can hope for...

44:15.039 --> 44:17.540
the only silver lining in all of this...

44:17.575 --> 44:19.376
is that when we break through,

44:19.610 --> 44:22.212
we find a few familiar faces

44:22.246 --> 44:25.448
waiting on the other side.
