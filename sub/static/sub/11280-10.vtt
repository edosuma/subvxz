CHRIS ROCK:
Christmas in Bed-Stuy
was a magical time.

00:13.714 --> 00:17.151
There was snow, there were
twinkling lights.

00:17.185 --> 00:21.122
Something about the holidays
brought out the best in people.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.691
People in the neighborhood
were more generous...

00:23.724 --> 00:25.626
Merry Christmas,
here's your scarf.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.161
I threw in a free
gift wrapping.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.729
Here's your insulation.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.233
Watch your step.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.667
Happy holidays.
Thank you.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.070
They seemed more concerned
about the needy...

00:36.104 --> 00:38.772
I know you lost
your man, Mrs. Roberts.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.774
But with a body like that,

00:40.808 --> 00:44.212
I know Santa's going
to bring you another one.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.181
And everyone had
that Christmas spirit.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.118
This Christmas tree-- $5.00.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.354
Hey, hey, hey!
Give me that money!

00:53.387 --> 00:55.356
Even if it belonged
to somebody else.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.826
Holiday cheer
was going all around.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.694
But there was something else
going around the city--

01:00.728 --> 01:02.730
the flu.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.698
Ma, do we have to
wear all this stuff?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.100
Yes.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.102
There's a bad strain
of the flu going around

01:08.136 --> 01:10.104
and I don't need
anybody getting sick.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.839
Feel like my throat
is a little scratchy.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.807
But we already
got our flu shots.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.209
You did, but Chris didn't.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.777
Chris, I want you
to meet me after school

01:16.810 --> 01:17.645
so you can get yours.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.512
But in the meantime,

01:18.546 --> 01:20.214
I want you to stay away
from other kids.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.382
Don't touch anything,

01:21.415 --> 01:22.516
don't even breathe
unless you have to.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.851
Now go.
Go, go, go.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.419
If it was up to my mother,

01:25.453 --> 01:27.455
she would've sent me
to school like this.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.559
Looks like I should be
selling subway tokens.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.728
For me, this was going to be
the best Christmas ever.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.796
Because I was working at Doc's,

01:35.829 --> 01:38.532
I could afford actual presents
for my family,

01:38.566 --> 01:40.434
not the crappy kind kids make.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.870
A Play-Doh skillet.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.473
You shouldn't have.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.841
Papier-mÃ¢chÃ© work boots.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.810
I love it.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.679
What's this,
a fruitcake?

01:51.712 --> 01:53.814
No, it's a vegetable cake.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.416
I ain't eating that.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.587
In my neighborhood,
we had layaway,

01:59.620 --> 02:02.856
where you paid off $5.00 a week
until you owned something.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.426
It was like having a credit
card and a hostage situation,

02:05.459 --> 02:07.895
all rolled into one.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.863
I was getting presents
on layaway

02:09.897 --> 02:11.765
and a shot to keep
the flu away.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.505
God, I hope they hurry up,
so we can get inside

02:17.538 --> 02:19.807
before they start
reusing the needles.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.378
Sorry about that.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.680
You getting a
flu shot, too?

02:26.714 --> 02:29.183
Yeah.
Make mine a double.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.418
:
* Silent night

03:04.452 --> 03:07.255
At school, the holiday brought
out the school choir.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.790
* Holy night

03:09.823 --> 03:11.925
* All is calm...

03:13.494 --> 03:14.495
Ow.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.863
Pull it together, Smokey.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.265
I don't want to be here all day.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.799
Okay, okay.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.702
This time, sing it with feeling.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.871
You're singing about
an impoverished family,

03:23.904 --> 03:25.806
living in the ghetto,

03:25.839 --> 03:29.743
who gave birth to their
firstborn child in a manger.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.712
Chris, you can relate

03:31.745 --> 03:33.847
to this, can't you?

03:33.881 --> 03:34.782
Not really.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.817
All right, give me a minute

03:36.850 --> 03:39.520
and then we'll try it again.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.556
You don't look so good.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.891
Are you getting sick?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.959
'Cause you've got
to be careful.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.895
The flu's going around
and it's no joke.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.697
My father has it,
and last night,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.965
it sounded like
he coughed up a lung.
I can't get sick.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.502
I need to work, so I can get
my presents out of layaway.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.803
This year,
I went all out.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.971
I got everybody something
that they really wanted.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.440
Like what?

03:59.473 --> 04:02.042
A Billy Ocean tea set!
Thanks, Chris.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.346
A Wayne Gretzky hockey game!
Thanks, Chris.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.415
The Young and the Restless
soundtrack

04:07.448 --> 04:08.882
featuring "Nadia's Theme"?!

04:08.916 --> 04:10.784
Thanks, Chris.

04:10.818 --> 04:14.388
Patti Labelle's
"New Attitude" perfume?!

04:14.422 --> 04:16.390
Thank you, Chris.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.994
Wow, that's a lot of stuff.

04:21.028 --> 04:21.829
Sounds expensive.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.597
It is; I got it
from Goldstein's.

04:23.631 --> 04:24.632
What?

04:24.665 --> 04:25.733
Are you crazy?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.835
I don't even shop there
and I'm white.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.837
Okay...

04:29.870 --> 04:31.905
Well, I need to pay $35
before Christmas Eve

04:31.939 --> 04:34.508
or else they're
gonna sell it.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.078
I'm warning you.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.780
TEACHER:
Bless you.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.815
Oh, poor Chris.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.318
Winters can be so tough
when you can't afford heat.

04:44.352 --> 04:47.020
I've got heat.

04:47.054 --> 04:47.721
Okay, let's try it again.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.491
Greg, would you start us off?

04:50.524 --> 04:54.395
* Silent night...

04:54.428 --> 04:56.497
Rochelle!

04:56.530 --> 04:57.965
Whenever Christmas came around,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.933
my father always
picked up extra work,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.802
so he could afford presents.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.973
Christmas tree?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.074
No, thank you.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.009
Hanukkah bush?
No, thanks.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.411
Kwanzaa stump?

05:10.444 --> 05:11.379
What'd you call me, man?!

05:11.412 --> 05:12.913
Hey, uh, free trees, man.

05:12.946 --> 05:13.981
They didn't always work out,

05:14.014 --> 05:15.616
but he never stopped trying.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.984
You're looking at
Goldstein's

05:17.017 --> 05:17.951
newest Santa Claus.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.888
New Santa?!
What happened to the old Santa?

05:20.921 --> 05:22.756
They just keep coming.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.592
Lines and lines of children.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.659
Thousands of them.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.727
Where are they
coming from?!

05:26.760 --> 05:27.795
Let me go!

05:27.828 --> 05:29.029
All these kids.
Mommy!

05:29.062 --> 05:30.364
Look at the line!
Let me go!

05:30.398 --> 05:33.667
So, a black Santa, huh?
Yeah!

05:33.701 --> 05:36.770
He could tell them
he's from the South Pole.

05:36.804 --> 05:40.007
Drew and Tanya hadn't been on
their best behavior all year,

05:40.040 --> 05:42.042
so they decided to try
to make up for it

05:42.075 --> 05:43.977
by helping my mother
during the holidays.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.680
It was kind of like campaigning
for gifts.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.816
They helped with cleaning...

05:49.450 --> 05:51.084
Move, boy.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.889
They helped with cooking.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.025
After this, I can
take out the trash.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.960
And I can help you
with the dishes.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.495
Okay.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.464
They even tried to help
with things

06:03.497 --> 06:05.032
my mother didn't want
help with.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.534
BOTH:
You need any help?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.068
No.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.037
You sure?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.138
No, boy!

06:11.171 --> 06:12.873
Get away from
the damn door.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.709
Ooh, I want this.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.910
Ooh, and I want this.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.045
Hey.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.082
What are you guys doing?

06:22.115 --> 06:23.417
Nothing.
Nothing.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.918
You need any help?

06:24.952 --> 06:26.520
No, I'm fine.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.989
Well, if you need anything,
just let us know.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.559
She needs you to
act like this in March.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.999
So, Doc, what are you
doing for the holidays?

06:39.032 --> 06:41.134
Well, I'm not falling
into that Christmas trap,

06:41.168 --> 06:43.437
that's for sure.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.105
What Christmas trap?

06:45.138 --> 06:46.974
Commercializing Christmas.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.977
People buyin' things
they can't afford...

06:50.010 --> 06:52.012
bein' broke before
the year come in.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.148
Uh-uh, not me.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.183
So you don't celebrate
Christmas?

06:56.216 --> 06:57.217
Oh, I celebrate
Christmas.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.719
I love me some Christmas.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.688
It's supposed to be
Jesus' birthday.

07:00.721 --> 07:04.091
So I say a prayer.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.993
Happy birthday, Jesus.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.061
And I have a piece of cake.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.198
This year is seven-layer
chocolate cake.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.001
Boy, cover your mouth.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.869
Stop sneezing on Jesus.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.170
What's the matter, you sick?

07:17.204 --> 07:18.071
No, I'm fine.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.139
All right, then.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.210
Here's your Christmas bonus.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.578
Whoa, thanks, Doc.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.113
There must be, like,
$50 in here.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.681
No, it's $75.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.050
Now you can play video games
till the cows come home.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.119
Yeah, but what are these?

07:32.152 --> 07:34.187
What, they're
game tokens.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.857
You didn't think I was
giving you quarters, did you?

07:36.890 --> 07:37.958
Yes.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.960
No.
Thanks, Doc.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.695
Doc took the expression

07:41.729 --> 07:43.597
"a token of my appreciation"
literally.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.802
Hey, Dad,
you want some coffee?

07:48.836 --> 07:49.837
Sure.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.539
And some cream?

07:51.572 --> 07:53.206
Just a little.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.575
Wow, you guys are really

07:54.608 --> 07:55.743
helping out
a lot lately.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.545
No problem.
No problem.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.080
Since I was strapped for cash,

08:00.113 --> 08:02.282
I knew there was one thing
I could ask my father for--

08:02.315 --> 08:03.984
a J-O-B.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.819
Oh, you look so cute.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.020
I got him a job

08:07.054 --> 08:09.122
taking pictures of me and
the kids down at Goldstein's.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.592
Oh!
You look stupid.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.060
You look stupid.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.795
You look like an elf and you're
not even wearing a costume.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.630
Hey...

08:18.666 --> 08:19.833
ROCHELLE:
Mm!

08:19.867 --> 08:21.101
You're not getting sick,
are you?

08:21.134 --> 08:22.102
Yes.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.604
No.
Just in case,

08:23.637 --> 08:25.639
take some of that cough
syrup before we leave.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.640
Okay.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.108
Ma, is there any more bacon?

08:28.141 --> 08:29.109
Here.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.678
Take that.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.045
Hey, I was going
to eat that.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.147
When you get a job,
I'll give it back.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.784
That's called slave justice.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.285
My mother thought Tanya and
Drew's behavior

08:38.318 --> 08:39.920
was too good to be true.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.921
And she was right.

08:40.954 --> 08:41.989
I knew it.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.090
Knew what?

08:43.123 --> 08:45.626
Drew and Tanya trying
to pull something.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.094
Look at this.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.899
"Malibu Barbie
dream house,

08:51.932 --> 08:53.066
"Easy Bake Oven,
Mm-hmm.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.569
an electric train,
samurai sword..."

08:55.603 --> 08:57.638
They must think I'm
Santa Claus for real.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.673
That's what's wrong
with kids nowadays.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.308
Christmas comes, they
don't think about giving.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.976
All they can think
about is getting.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.845
Well, we can't afford this.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.146
What are we going to do?

09:06.179 --> 09:08.181
I'm going to ask Santa
for some new kids.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.883
He asked for that last year.

09:09.917 --> 09:10.918
Chris!

09:10.951 --> 09:11.952
Come on.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.153
Okay.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.288
I had to make sure
I didn't get sick,

09:15.322 --> 09:17.157
even if I had to drink
cough syrup

09:17.190 --> 09:18.759
like a rapper from Houston.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.732
While my dad was trying to
figure out what he could give,

09:24.765 --> 09:26.734
the kids at Goldstein's
were trying to figure out

09:26.767 --> 09:28.135
what they could get.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.171
So, what can Santa give
you for Christmas?

09:31.204 --> 09:34.341
A Malibu Barbie with
a pink, remote-control Corvette,

09:34.374 --> 09:36.143
the Barbie townhouse,

09:36.176 --> 09:37.778
and the Barbie
swimming pool.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.815
Whoo! Do you know how much
all that stuff costs?

09:41.849 --> 09:43.283
No.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.786
Well, Santa's going to tell you.

09:45.819 --> 09:50.390
It costs $137.16.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.392
Do you have that
kind of money?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.694
No.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.963
Well, neither does Santa.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.398
Welcome to my world, kid.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.933
CHRIS:
Merry Christmas.

10:04.672 --> 10:07.240
Who's next?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.109
All right.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.243
Oh, look at
this big guy!

10:10.277 --> 10:11.311
Oh! There you go!

10:11.344 --> 10:13.180
Now, what would
you like Santa

10:13.213 --> 10:14.682
to get you for Christmas?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.349
I want an Easy Bake oven.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.785
An electric train set.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.286
I would like Hot Wheels.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.320
A puppy.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.388
Eyesight?

10:21.421 --> 10:23.156
Hmm. That sounds
expensive.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.892
Do you know how
much a puppy costs?

10:24.925 --> 10:27.060
Does that come with a
easy

10:27.094 --> 10:29.129
Do you know they cost
as much as a real car?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.397
Now, how you going to
pay for this eyesight?

10:30.430 --> 10:33.366
Do you really want your parents
to work themselves to the bone

10:33.400 --> 10:35.035
just to get you
a train set

10:35.068 --> 10:36.670
you're going to quit
playing with after a week?

10:36.704 --> 10:37.805
What if this
puppy grows up,

10:37.838 --> 10:39.807
gets rabies,
bites somebody...?

10:39.840 --> 10:40.808
And you ain't going
to be satisfied

10:40.841 --> 10:42.209
with just one Hot Wheel.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.978
No, you going to want the
whole collection of 'em.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.313
Can you afford
a lawsuit?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.448
Do you really want your
daddy to take out a loan,

10:48.481 --> 10:50.450
just so you can get
some Hot Wheels?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.252
You going to bankrupt
your whole family

10:52.285 --> 10:53.386
just so you can
get a puppy?

10:53.420 --> 10:54.955
If you're good,

10:54.988 --> 10:56.824
Santa will send you
a train token,

10:56.857 --> 10:58.926
and you can take
the subway downtown

10:58.959 --> 11:00.227
and get a job
for Christmas.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.262
Mommy!

11:02.295 --> 11:04.965
Merry Christmas.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.403
Black Santa Claus
caused more tears

11:10.437 --> 11:12.940
than the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.274
Remember what
I told you.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.243
Ho-ho-ho.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.414
Chris, you okay?

11:21.448 --> 11:23.350
Yeah. It's just 'cause this
costume is really hot.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.786
I'm starting to feel dizzy.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.221
Julius, we
got a problem.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.390
You mean besides the fact
that you got a black Santa

11:30.423 --> 11:32.092
working in a white
department store

11:32.125 --> 11:33.460
called Goldstein's?

11:33.493 --> 11:34.795
What's wrong?

11:34.828 --> 11:37.330
You're not presenting the image

11:37.364 --> 11:38.832
of Christmas that
we're trying to promote,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.000
here at Goldstein's.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.969
Image

11:42.002 --> 11:43.403
You're Santa Claus.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.205
You're not supposed to
make the children cry.

11:45.238 --> 11:48.275
These kids need to learn
the truth about life.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.077
Uh... Dad?

11:50.110 --> 11:51.244
Not now, Chris.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.980
I'm sorry, uh... I just

11:53.013 --> 11:54.381
don't feel like
Goldstein's

11:54.414 --> 11:56.249
is the right
fit for you.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.417
Dad, I really
don't feel that well.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.387
You're firing me
at Christmastime?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.322
That's the only time
you can fire Santa.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.159
Yes.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.394
Fine.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.863
Chris, come on.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.364
Chris!

12:11.398 --> 12:13.100
I don't know
if he was more concerned

12:13.133 --> 12:14.334
because I lost consciousness

12:14.367 --> 12:17.004
or because
I lost a half day's pay.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.343
I checked out at the store
and checked in to the hospital.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.012
Walking pneumonia?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.313
That doesn't sound that bad.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.015
Well, it started
as walking pneumonia.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.417
Now, is this correct?
The boy has two jobs?

12:30.450 --> 12:33.053
Well... yeah,
I mean...

12:33.086 --> 12:34.221
Well, that's
the problem.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.222
He needs some rest.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.390
Well, what should we do
when we get him home?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.792
Well, you should
pick up the phone,

12:38.826 --> 12:39.793
call an ambulance,
and get them

12:39.827 --> 12:40.393
to bring him back
over here.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.962
He's got a fever of 103,

12:41.995 --> 12:43.563
he overdosed
on cough syrup,

12:43.596 --> 12:44.932
and he's delirious.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.967
Delirious?
Yes.

12:47.000 --> 12:47.968
He keeps mumbling something

12:48.001 --> 12:49.502
about getting the
president out of layaway.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.405
I'll be back to
check on him.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.507
Baby, well, you get
some rest, okay?

12:54.541 --> 12:57.577
Mommy's going to come back
and check on you later. Okay?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.080
All right, man...

13:00.113 --> 13:02.883
Whoa! That's my 72 cents
worth of sandwich!

13:02.916 --> 13:03.884
He ain't going to eat it.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.318
Put it back...

13:05.352 --> 13:07.988
He's delirious.
Put it back!

13:08.021 --> 13:10.323
When they found out
I was in the hospital,

13:10.357 --> 13:12.159
Tonya and Drew were devastated.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.360
Chris got sick.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.462
Now we can't get anything
for Christmas.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.530
Man, we were good for nothing.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.500
No, you were good
because you were
supposed to be good.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.502
I mean, what if
there were
no Christmas?

13:22.535 --> 13:24.171
Would you be running
around here

13:24.204 --> 13:25.538
starting forest fires?

13:25.572 --> 13:26.206
No.
No.

13:26.239 --> 13:29.009
We can't even have one gift?

13:29.042 --> 13:31.511
You live your whole
life here for free.
Mm-hmm.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.214
Tonya, you get
gifts every day.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.550
Food is a gift.
The heat is a gift.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.152
Your shoes are a gift.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.221
This house
is a gift.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.856
Those frames on the walls
are a gift.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.391
The magazines
are a gift.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.559
That ashtray is a gift.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.029
This lampshade is a gift.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.397
That chair
is a gift.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.099
This pillow
is a gift.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.500
The remote control
is a gift.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.568
The TV is a gift.
This carpet

13:55.602 --> 13:57.370
is a gift.
The pink carpet

13:57.404 --> 13:58.438
in your room
is a gift.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.909
Being able to cut out
of this scene is a gift.

14:05.112 --> 14:08.515
: Ho-ho-ho.
Merry Christmas.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.221
Hey, what's
wrong with you?

14:14.254 --> 14:16.523
What?!

14:16.556 --> 14:18.225
Hey, who are you?

14:18.258 --> 14:20.527
I'm Kris.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.562
I'm Chris.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.631
Wow. What a small world, huh?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.633
So what happened to you?

14:26.666 --> 14:30.003
Well, I don't really know.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.139
Last thing
I remember, I was

14:32.172 --> 14:34.607
in Goldstein's
dressed as an elf.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.443
Next thing I know, I'm in here.

14:36.476 --> 14:42.549
Hey, that makes you
one of Santa's helpers, huh?

14:42.582 --> 14:47.420
Yeah. My dad was working
as Santa, but he got fired.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.457
Oh, that's too bad. Sorry.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.526
But it really could
be a lot worse.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.562
And how's that?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.464
He could be me.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.267
I have rheumatoid
arthritis.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.634
I had a really
nasty flareup.

15:01.668 --> 15:05.005
Cold weather really kills me.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.707
But, you know,
stuff happens
in life, you know.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.678
Hey, you know,
I was watching your family,

15:11.711 --> 15:14.647
and you should know
it's really a beautiful thing

15:14.681 --> 15:16.349
how much they care about you.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.517
You shouldn't forget that.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.586
Well, I guess you're right.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.989
I know I'm right.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.591
Listen, why don't
you get some sleep, kid, huh?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.659
And merry Christmas.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.727
Thanks.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.963
* 'Cause he knows...

15:29.997 --> 15:31.231
You, too.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.667
* It's past bedtime

15:34.701 --> 15:38.405
* For toys.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.510
Merry Christmas.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.646
Hey, man, what are
you doing here?

15:46.679 --> 15:47.447
Well, since it's Christmas Eve,

15:47.480 --> 15:48.548
I wanted
to give you your present.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.484
But when I called your dad,
he said you were here.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.553
Here's your gift.
It's baseball cards.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.422
Baseball cards?!
Where did you
get baseball cards

15:55.455 --> 15:56.656
in the middle of winter?

15:56.689 --> 15:58.325
The Venezuelan League.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.726
It took a lot of doing.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.562
By the way, if I were you,
I wouldn't eat the gum.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.298
Well, I don't
have your gift.
It's cool.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.067
You can just double up
on my birthday.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.701
Deal! Two socks, it is!

16:08.735 --> 16:10.370
Well, I got to go.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.638
Go? But you just got here.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.273
I got to go down
to Rockefeller Center

16:13.306 --> 16:14.707
and see the Christmas tree.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.576
Then my mom's taking me
ice skating with her boyfriend.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.279
All right, well, have fun.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.381
Yeah. Get well.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.116
Thanks. Catch you later.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.620
Well, this sucks.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.389
Hey, what's your
problem, man, huh?

16:29.422 --> 16:32.359
Well, I hate being
in this hospital!

16:32.392 --> 16:33.793
I hate the fact
that I'm sitting here,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.262
and I'm sick!

16:35.295 --> 16:36.796
And I also hate that
I put some presents

16:36.829 --> 16:38.598
on layaway to give to my family,

16:38.631 --> 16:39.699
and now I can't give them
to them.

16:39.732 --> 16:43.803
Layaway?! Layaway
is your problem?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.605
Are you kidding me?

16:45.638 --> 16:47.607
You're thinking
about layaway
when there's

16:47.640 --> 16:49.342
300 patients in this hospital,

16:49.376 --> 16:51.744
and four nurses,
and three are out sick,

16:51.778 --> 16:52.612
and one's out at lunch?

16:52.645 --> 16:55.348
Layaway! You didn't
see that family

16:55.382 --> 16:57.584
that was attacked
by 1,200 beavers, did you?

16:57.617 --> 16:59.252
And that poor mother,

16:59.286 --> 17:01.621
she came in here,
they thought it was a fur coat,

17:01.654 --> 17:03.656
and they kicked her out.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.758
She had 1,200 beavers
sucking her skin!

17:05.792 --> 17:07.094
And you're worried
about layaway?

17:07.127 --> 17:09.362
What about the kid
in the gang war?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.731
He got shot.
Nine toes got shot off!

17:11.764 --> 17:15.068
Nine! He has one toe! One toe!

17:15.102 --> 17:18.171
And they wouldn't even give him
nail polish for the one toe.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.540
Sad. There's a poor
guy down there,

17:20.573 --> 17:22.375
he lost both his legs.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.776
They won't even
give him any crutches,

17:23.810 --> 17:25.512
'cause he can't afford it
and he has no insurance.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.780
So you know what they gave him?
A pogo stick.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.250
You're worried
about layaway.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.119
See that kid downstairs?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.354
They're going to make a movie
of the week about this guy.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.855
He got bit by 400 rats,

17:35.888 --> 17:37.724
and they won't even
give him a rabies shot.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.626
They gave him
a coloring book.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.594
Let me tell you
something, Chris.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.730
I bet every patient
in this hospital

17:43.763 --> 17:45.665
would give their left arm
if their only problem

17:45.698 --> 17:48.168
was getting their gifts
out of layaway.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.739
After he said that,
I started to think

17:52.772 --> 17:55.208
about things you couldn't
put on layaway.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.210
You took out my kidney?

17:57.244 --> 18:00.880
Yeah, but we got you
a new kidney
out of layaway!

18:00.913 --> 18:03.650
Merry Christmas.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.652
What happened to my leg?!

18:05.685 --> 18:07.687
We had to cut it off.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.856
But we got you one
out of layaway!

18:09.889 --> 18:12.192
Merry Christmas!

18:12.225 --> 18:15.695
Doctor, is my boy
going to make it?

18:15.728 --> 18:18.265
No. But we've got
another one on layaway!

18:18.298 --> 18:19.666
Bobby!

18:19.699 --> 18:21.268
Merry Christmas!

18:21.301 --> 18:22.502
Thank you.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.672
The only thing worse than
Christmas without my family

18:25.705 --> 18:27.907
is having green Jell-O
for breakfast.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.176
Here you go.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.178
Merry Christmas.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.745
I hate green Jell-O.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.881
Well, it's either
this or ice chips,

18:34.914 --> 18:37.284
so take your pick.
Fine.

18:37.317 --> 18:41.254
Hey, where's Kris?

18:41.288 --> 18:42.489
Who?

18:42.522 --> 18:44.357
The old white guy.
He was in the bed.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.825
There was no one in that bed.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.794
Yes, there was.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.429
I sat there, and I talked
to him for two days.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.763
I even played
checkers with him.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.599
Did you break into the pharmacy?

18:52.632 --> 18:53.733
'Cause if you're stealing drugs,

18:53.766 --> 18:54.667
we'll kick you
right out of here.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.835
I didn't steal any drugs.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.606
You're delirious.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.808
Eat your Jell-O.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.344
Hi, baby!
Merry Christmas!

19:04.377 --> 19:06.613
Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.215
It's Christmas, stupid.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.749
Well, you didn't think
we'd want to leave you here

19:09.782 --> 19:10.717
by yourself, did you?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.652
Well, I didn't think
you'd want to be here.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.721
Without you, there would
be no Christmas.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.356
It'd just be a "s'mas."

19:16.389 --> 19:17.490
It's okay, baby.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.626
Ho-ho-ho!
Merry Christmas!

19:19.659 --> 19:21.828
Wow!

19:21.861 --> 19:23.963
Hey! Where did you
get all this stuff?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.798
Yeah!
I thought you got fired.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.766
I did.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.801
Well, baby, how did
you pay for all of this?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.470
Chris bought it.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.839
He had it in layaway
before he got sick.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.507
I got it
out for him.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.444
Thank you, baby.
That's so sweet.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.711
Well, merry Christmas, y'all!

19:38.745 --> 19:40.380
I thought this Christmas

19:40.413 --> 19:42.349
was going to be
one of the worst,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.917
but it turned out
to be one of the best,

19:44.951 --> 19:48.388
'cause I learned that
you can't put love on layaway.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.789
This is for you.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.291
What's this?

19:51.324 --> 19:54.794
A receipt.
You owe me $35.

19:54.827 --> 19:55.928
He's serious.

20:00.733 --> 20:04.337
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.240
