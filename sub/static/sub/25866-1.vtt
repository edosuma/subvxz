01:09.560 --> 01:11.143
- How much further?

01:12.019 --> 01:13.975
- How much further?

01:13.976 --> 01:15.596
- We're here.

01:15.597 --> 01:16.597
- Here?

01:18.317 --> 01:22.567
- Not to call you a liar,
but not seeing any ruins.

01:41.855 --> 01:44.438
Yeah, I'm not going down there.

02:51.219 --> 02:52.469
- What is that?

02:59.677 --> 03:03.177
- The Aztecs, they
believed the human soul

03:04.995 --> 03:08.328
is comprised of five
parts, five pieces.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.661
In order for the devil
to take a soul,

03:21.656 --> 03:23.989
he needs to obtain all five.

03:27.232 --> 03:28.982
We shouldn't be here.

03:30.433 --> 03:32.935
We, we gotta go, now.

03:32.936 --> 03:35.519
- No, we're not going anywhere.

04:04.565 --> 04:05.565
Wow.

04:12.547 --> 04:14.464
- We shouldn't be here.

04:17.803 --> 04:19.053
- Check it out.

04:33.805 --> 04:35.548
- We gotta get out of here.

04:35.549 --> 04:36.549
- No.

04:54.008 --> 04:55.008
- Leave it.

05:17.328 --> 05:19.229
- Welcome.

05:31.768 --> 05:33.935
- That's a hell of a face.

06:55.214 --> 06:56.297
- We're here.

07:30.264 --> 07:33.783
- Oh balls.

07:33.784 --> 07:35.284
- Well holy, holy.

07:40.403 --> 07:41.903
Welcome home, sis.

07:49.897 --> 07:51.543
- Thought he'd outlive us all.

07:51.544 --> 07:54.743
- He never stopped
asking about you.

07:54.744 --> 07:56.359
- I'm sure.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.402
- You know just
last week he was...

07:58.403 --> 08:00.903
- Can I have a second, please?

08:01.880 --> 08:03.213
- Sure, fuck it.

08:19.399 --> 08:22.279
- You know what's
on the other side?

08:22.280 --> 08:23.280
The devil.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.947
When he comes, and he will come,

08:31.828 --> 08:34.245
that's where he'll come from.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.717
He will take you, one
piece at a time.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.833
- Morgan, thought that was you.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.166
I ain't seen you since, what?

09:01.167 --> 09:02.250
- Graduation.

09:03.348 --> 09:06.931
- Heard you was living
in the Rotten Apple.

09:07.951 --> 09:08.951
- I was.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.006
- Hold on.
- Sure.

09:17.972 --> 09:19.869
- Hey, where are you going?

09:19.870 --> 09:21.390
- I gotta flight.

09:21.391 --> 09:23.433
- Is that a fucking joke?

09:23.434 --> 09:24.431
I can't believe you.

09:24.432 --> 09:26.710
I haven't seen you
since graduation.

09:26.711 --> 09:29.369
- He didn't give me much
of a choice, Natalie.

09:29.370 --> 09:30.927
- Bullshit.
- Whatever.

09:30.928 --> 09:33.048
- What now you just breeze
in here, pay your respects,

09:33.072 --> 09:35.950
and split, just like that?

09:35.951 --> 09:37.951
Poof, taillights. - Yeah.

09:40.074 --> 09:41.326
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:41.327 --> 09:44.077
This shit is not
flying, come on.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.645
- What's your problem?

09:49.646 --> 09:52.883
- Like it or not, we're
all that's left.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.326
Look, I know you two
had your issues,

09:55.327 --> 09:58.660
but you have got to
let go of your hate.

09:59.727 --> 10:02.644
- He disowned me,
I wasn't even 18.

10:06.884 --> 10:08.802
- What are you doing?

10:14.266 --> 10:16.283
- Looks just the
same, doesn't it?

10:16.284 --> 10:17.617
- I guess, yeah.

10:21.524 --> 10:23.523
- I remember when we
played The Floor is Lava

10:23.524 --> 10:26.691
and I hung from that
water pipe there.

10:28.084 --> 10:31.323
- Yeah, you kicked off one
of Pop's track lights

10:31.324 --> 10:36.074
that set off the sprinkler
system and cost him a fortune.

10:41.107 --> 10:42.745
- I have to go.

10:42.746 --> 10:45.413
- He never got over you leaving.

10:48.502 --> 10:51.385
- I didn't leave, Natalie.

10:51.386 --> 10:53.465
- You just can't keep
rolling through life

10:53.466 --> 10:55.705
blaming your crap
on everybody else.

10:55.706 --> 10:57.145
- What do you want from me?

10:57.146 --> 10:59.646
- I want you to own your shit.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.167
- Noted.

11:06.068 --> 11:07.068
- Oh my God.

11:10.287 --> 11:11.287
- Morgan.

11:13.188 --> 11:15.105
I can take your burden.

11:16.548 --> 11:17.548
- Piss off.

11:18.964 --> 11:19.964
Freak show.

11:27.044 --> 11:28.044
Bingo.

11:33.087 --> 11:34.087
- Hey girl.

11:35.566 --> 11:37.733
I've been looking for you.

12:03.084 --> 12:04.843
My place work for you?

12:04.844 --> 12:06.075
- Where do you live?

12:06.076 --> 12:07.909
- Close, man, no home.

12:11.042 --> 12:14.542
- That works, I got
somewhere to be later.

13:23.223 --> 13:24.640
Shit, it's stuck.

13:26.380 --> 13:27.380
Come on.

13:35.260 --> 13:36.260
Oh man.

14:14.709 --> 14:15.792
Welcome home.

14:46.604 --> 14:47.687
- Okay, okay.

14:59.244 --> 15:00.661
I can't, I can't.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.426
You got me.

15:43.482 --> 15:47.303
I'm gonna get ya, I'm gonna
get ya, here I come.

16:09.122 --> 16:10.205
- Here we go.

16:50.479 --> 16:51.479
I'm rich?

17:03.804 --> 17:04.971
What the hell?

18:55.627 --> 18:56.960
Creepy ass shit.

19:05.483 --> 19:07.483
Time to make the donuts.

19:34.384 --> 19:37.078
- Morgan, go play
somewhere else.

19:37.079 --> 19:38.746
Go find your sister.

19:45.023 --> 19:49.546
- Robert, I wanted to revisit
our earlier conversation,

19:49.547 --> 19:51.282
about my place here.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.762
- Oh that is not right.

20:29.243 --> 20:31.482
- I can help more.
- No.

20:31.483 --> 20:32.566
- I can.
- No!

21:07.824 --> 21:08.824
- Shit.

21:30.405 --> 21:32.655
Okay, okay you guys got me.

21:33.925 --> 21:35.925
Now why don't we just...

21:45.467 --> 21:47.634
Shatterproof you assholes.

21:48.688 --> 21:49.688
Fuck you.

22:00.227 --> 22:01.227
What?

22:09.669 --> 22:10.669
Shit.

22:34.315 --> 22:37.565
Wait, will you please
hold on a second?

22:38.528 --> 22:39.528
Please.

22:47.624 --> 22:49.707
Bitch, I'm from Glendale.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.847
Where'd you guys go, huh?

23:10.848 --> 23:13.147
We were just getting started.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.150
Shit.

24:18.345 --> 24:19.345
Shit.

24:21.081 --> 24:22.081
Come on.

25:43.725 --> 25:44.907
You messed

25:44.908 --> 25:46.075
with the wrong

25:47.165 --> 25:48.165
girl.

26:19.423 --> 26:20.590
What the fuck?

26:27.822 --> 26:28.822
Ow.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.200
Shit.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.144
God dammit.

26:48.504 --> 26:49.504
Help, help.

26:56.381 --> 26:57.381
Hello?

27:19.236 --> 27:20.403
What the hell?

27:57.752 --> 28:00.669
- I'll take your
burden, I want to.

28:02.696 --> 28:06.363
- Trust me, there's
nothing that you can do.

28:10.141 --> 28:11.682
- I want my piece.

28:31.842 --> 28:32.842
Oh shit.

28:34.322 --> 28:35.322
Shit.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.774
What do I do now?

28:48.312 --> 28:49.979
Think, think, think.

29:05.917 --> 29:06.917
Help.

29:13.238 --> 29:14.238
Help me!

29:17.160 --> 29:18.160
Anyone?

29:29.559 --> 29:31.642
What the hell's going on?

31:17.757 --> 31:19.057
- Hey Pumpkin.

31:19.058 --> 31:21.891
So I guess if you're
hearing this,

31:23.319 --> 31:25.652
I guess that means I'm dead.

31:26.978 --> 31:28.145
I think it's...

31:59.037 --> 32:00.037
- Shit.

32:45.837 --> 32:46.837
No.

33:36.033 --> 33:37.700
That is not awesome.

34:30.192 --> 34:33.088
- That's where it's coming from.

34:33.089 --> 34:36.172
It will take you one
piece at a time.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.250
- I need a drink.

35:38.250 --> 35:40.083
Please make this stop.

35:49.487 --> 35:51.820
Why is this happening to me?

36:08.047 --> 36:09.047
My eye.

38:16.620 --> 38:17.620
Not again.

39:23.690 --> 39:25.273
It's all backwards.

39:32.330 --> 39:35.997
- You should go
backwards from here.

39:37.690 --> 39:39.273
- I don't think so.

39:49.303 --> 39:50.386
Hello, hello?

40:02.503 --> 40:03.836
Cruel, isn't it?

41:26.548 --> 41:27.548
Backwards.

41:38.896 --> 41:39.896
Backwards.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.773
Can't catch a break.

42:53.420 --> 42:54.420
Natalie?

42:56.299 --> 42:59.549
- If you go in there,
I can't help you.

44:21.115 --> 44:22.198
- This bitch.

44:26.827 --> 44:28.660
Two down, three to go.

44:54.969 --> 44:58.039
- We can live together
in here forever,

44:58.040 --> 45:01.123
just the two of us,
forever and ever.

45:41.618 --> 45:42.618
- Fuck this.

47:05.277 --> 47:07.194
What the hell was that?

47:22.120 --> 47:24.759
- I was there with you.

47:24.760 --> 47:27.093
I've always been behind you.

48:14.356 --> 48:15.556
- What is it?

48:15.557 --> 48:16.557
- Open it.

48:43.815 --> 48:45.175
- Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

48:45.176 --> 48:47.734
A hundred thank
yous and a million.

48:47.735 --> 48:49.568
I love you, thank you.

48:51.091 --> 48:52.091
- You're welcome honey.

48:52.092 --> 48:54.213
And we can live here together,
just the two of us.

48:54.214 --> 48:55.631
Forever and ever.

49:21.735 --> 49:22.735
- Stop it.

49:54.722 --> 49:56.139
- Morgan.

50:00.822 --> 50:02.405
- What do you want?

51:01.243 --> 51:02.243
The keys!

51:20.082 --> 51:23.582
- The firstborn has
been promised.

51:24.922 --> 51:26.589
I'm here to collect.

52:37.905 --> 52:38.905
- I'm sorry.

52:40.646 --> 52:42.979
- Where am I supposed to go?

52:44.566 --> 52:46.649
- Your birthday's Monday.

52:50.086 --> 52:53.003
You need to be gone
by the weekend.

53:13.585 --> 53:16.752
- You can end the cycle.

53:43.521 --> 53:47.438
- Do you know what's on
the other side of that?

54:15.261 --> 54:17.761
- Morgan!
- How do I stop this?

54:49.126 --> 54:50.876
- There's no way out.

55:02.565 --> 55:03.565
- Fuck me.

55:16.203 --> 55:17.203
Here we go.

56:20.474 --> 56:23.807
Okay the arrow, I gotta
get to the safe.

56:26.117 --> 56:29.450
How the hell am I gonna
get to the safe?

56:51.294 --> 56:52.711
Yeah, this'll do.

58:11.833 --> 58:13.833
Let's go get that arrow.

01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:42.966
My leg.

01:01:55.982 --> 01:01:57.399
This can't be it.

01:04:45.358 --> 01:04:46.358
Eat this.

01:05:13.156 --> 01:05:14.573
How do I stop it?

01:05:46.137 --> 01:05:47.137
You fucker.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.100
I beat it.

01:06:13.938 --> 01:06:14.938
I beat it.

01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:23.170
That's it.

01:07:24.501 --> 01:07:27.418
I'm done, I'm not
playing any more.

01:08:01.205 --> 01:08:02.205
Thanks, Dad.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:01.636
I'm not afraid of you.

01:10:15.105 --> 01:10:16.105
Last one.

01:10:21.809 --> 01:10:22.809
So what now?

01:11:01.044 --> 01:11:02.044
- Morgan.

01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:08.082
One by one the pieces
are being swallowed.

01:11:09.585 --> 01:11:10.585
All mine.

01:11:16.865 --> 01:11:17.865
Yes.

01:11:19.719 --> 01:11:20.719
Come.

01:13:18.043 --> 01:13:19.043
I am wrath.

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:24.189
No other can save you, only me.

01:13:31.985 --> 01:13:35.985
Your father ran, and now
he's he's gonna repent.

01:13:45.644 --> 01:13:46.644
- In there?

01:14:48.806 --> 01:14:49.813
- Dad?

01:14:49.814 --> 01:14:52.140
- Hey pumpkin.
- What are you?

01:14:52.141 --> 01:14:54.058
- So I guess if you're,

01:14:54.963 --> 01:14:59.296
if you're hearing this, I
guess that means I'm dead.

01:15:00.188 --> 01:15:01.271
I think it's,

01:15:04.342 --> 01:15:06.587
it's only fair that you know

01:15:06.588 --> 01:15:09.838
that this is all,
everything, my fault.

01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:17.157
I never wanted to send you away.

01:15:21.029 --> 01:15:24.112
When I was a young
man I made a deal.

01:15:25.007 --> 01:15:27.128
I made a deal to sacrifice
something that I never

01:15:27.129 --> 01:15:29.712
thought that I'd actually have.

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:36.700
But once I did I knew
I couldn't do it.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:43.442
I couldn't hurt you, I couldn't
let anything hurt you.

01:15:43.466 --> 01:15:45.216
So I pushed you away.

01:15:49.146 --> 01:15:51.806
I'm not asking you for
your forgiveness,

01:15:51.807 --> 01:15:56.089
I know there's none to be
had, not after what I did.

01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.840
I just hope you
can let go of it,

01:15:59.828 --> 01:16:01.911
the hatred in your heart.

01:16:06.549 --> 01:16:09.049
I love you, Morgan, know that.

01:16:11.803 --> 01:16:14.220
I do love you, I always have.

01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:28.982
- The firstborn has
been promised.

01:22:05.164 --> 01:22:06.164
- I'm rich.

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.781
Wait, wait, wait.

01:24:33.782 --> 01:24:35.032
How many times?

01:24:36.918 --> 01:24:38.779
- Five times.

01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:41.556
- The Devil killed
you five times?

01:24:41.557 --> 01:24:42.557
- Oh, four.

01:24:50.259 --> 01:24:51.819
- If you don't wanna
give me the raise,

01:24:51.843 --> 01:24:53.759
you should just say so.
