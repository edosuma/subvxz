anybody even if--

35:24.348 --> 35:25.530
- And then on top of that--

- Even if they're ugly,
you'll kiss them.

- Come on, now.
- Some guys will.

35:29.353 --> 35:32.278

I'm actually attracted to.

- And then on top of that,
we're married.

You're entitled

35:45.477 --> 35:46.810
But my opinion is that

35:47.037 --> 35:50.939
I would have kissed you
on the lips.

35:52.726 --> 35:55.152
- I've never kissed anyone

35:55.379 --> 35:56.611
On the first, second,

<i> Then we need</i>
<i> to clear some things up.</i>

36:12.078 --> 36:14.171

36:19.827 --> 36:23.905

36:23.924 --> 36:27.184
- Four serious relationships.
Got you.

36:27.411 --> 36:28.576
What have you learned
from those four?

36:28.670 --> 36:30.002
Like the most recent one,
I guess you could say?

36:30.096 --> 36:33.356

solidified in what I want.

Something that's
important for me,

36:34.418 --> 36:36.267
Definitely in a relationship,

36:36.361 --> 36:39.103
Is, like, I want someone
who can spend time with me.

36:39.256 --> 36:41.180
I want someone
who can do things with me.

36:41.274 --> 36:42.866
I want someone who is reliable.

I'm just a touchy person.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.215

you've been touchy with me?

36:58.366 --> 37:00.291
- I am not like that

37:00.444 --> 37:02.293
On day one with people.

37:02.446 --> 37:03.795
It doesn't matter if I'm dating

37:03.947 --> 37:05.705
Or, like, if I just met you
as, like, a friend.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.633
For me, that comes with time.

37:08.785 --> 37:10.227
- Do you see that
ever happening?

37:12.789 --> 37:14.289
- For me, it's gonna take time.

37:14.307 --> 37:17.642

for me in the past.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.565
<i> Like really getting to know</i>
<i> each other deeply.</i>

37:32.584 --> 37:34.809

that's much more important

37:34.828 --> 37:38.922

is something that

1:08:29.848 --> 1:08:31.255
Grows with time

1:08:31.274 --> 1:08:34.000
Because I need, like,
a personal, emotional feeling.

In my girl mind, I'm like,
"am I moving too slow?

Like, for you?"

1:08:46.197 --> 1:08:48.957

I could feed you.

You--

1:10:12.209 --> 1:10:14.617
I'm down to get a dog.
- So I kind of want like a--

1:10:14.769 --> 1:10:17.027
Like, I foresee a boxer.

1:10:17.047 --> 1:10:19.047
One, 'cause when they're like
little baby puppies

1:10:19.198 --> 1:10:20.623
They're so cute

1:10:20.775 --> 1:10:21.607

- [laughs]

1:12:27.344 --> 1:12:31.346

1:12:31.573 --> 1:12:35.683
I cannot wait

1:12:35.835 --> 1:12:37.668
I'm not trying to be out here

- He has three lashes.

1:12:43.418 --> 1:12:45.193
- I didn't know that.

1:12:47.513 --> 1:12:48.863
Do you naturally have
three lashes on your eyes?

1:12:49.014 --> 1:12:51.090
- No.
- Okay.

1:12:51.183 --> 1:12:52.592

Eventually, I'm going to have
three lashes sticking out.

You're gonna have to

1:14:29.114 --> 1:14:31.874
- This is so bad.
- Okay, hold on.

1:14:32.026 --> 1:14:35.878

For just being cool and, like,
rolling with the punches

Just as far as
this whole experience

1:15:39.761 --> 1:15:41.018
And getting married.

1:15:41.112 --> 1:15:42.111
I know that was, like,
a big moment.

1:15:44.265 --> 1:15:46.282

your best and so am I.

1:15:51.272 --> 1:15:54.440
