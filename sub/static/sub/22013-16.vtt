WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.675
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.243 --> 00:12.012
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.987
-Previously on Empire...
-Andre is grown, Cookie.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.656
You can't talk to him
like he's a child. (shrieks)

00:22.690 --> 00:25.993
A 360-degree sensory
experience--

00:26.026 --> 00:27.061
"House Empire."

00:27.095 --> 00:29.330
The Empire streaming numbers
will rocket

00:29.363 --> 00:30.698
into the stratosphere.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.567
The Lyon family coerced
Eddie's resignation.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.569
I need Eddie Barker back.
So does Empire.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.605
THIRSTY:
It was Shine.
He had Giuliana killed

00:37.638 --> 00:38.506
to cover his tracks.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.007
I was always better than you.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.742
(gunshots)

00:41.775 --> 00:44.278
-You do not get
to be my mother now.
-Listen.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.614
-I don't ever want
to see you again.
-Loretha.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.050
Hey, Mama.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.087
(gasps)
Oh.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.789
(laughing):
Just c-come in.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.459
(Renee sighs)

00:58.492 --> 01:00.928
Do you need a kidney?

01:03.331 --> 01:05.299
This is probably a mistake.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.635
Lolo.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.906
I have missed you, pumpkin.

01:12.940 --> 01:16.344
(sighs)

01:27.755 --> 01:30.224
-(tea kettle whistling)
-Oh. Want some tea?

01:30.258 --> 01:32.226
-Mm-hmm, sure.
-I'll make you some tea.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.761
Okay.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.839
(sighs)

01:45.873 --> 01:48.008
You got anything stronger?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.444
(Renee laughs)

01:56.784 --> 01:59.653
Look, we need to distribute
the body parts throughout

01:59.687 --> 02:01.121
the four boroughs.
And do me a favor.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.823
Put his head in Staten Island.
(laughs)

02:02.856 --> 02:04.792
-Shiny Boots would hate that.
-Yo, this ain't what you

02:04.825 --> 02:07.328
promised us when you said you
were going legit with Lucious.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.796
Okay, first of all,
the only thing I promised you

02:08.829 --> 02:10.164
was to get your sister
in rehab, remember that?

02:10.198 --> 02:11.365
And, secondly,
Lucious helped keep

02:11.399 --> 02:13.267
men like me
from ending up men like him.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.369
What other fixers you know
with a 401K plan?

02:15.403 --> 02:16.304
All right? So shut up and get

02:16.337 --> 02:17.671
your ungrateful ass
back to work.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.173
-All right.
-(mocking): All right.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.111
* Come get what you wanted

02:24.144 --> 02:26.113
* Don't you stop
before you start it *

02:26.146 --> 02:30.551
* I'll give you every reason
not to stop after we started *

02:30.584 --> 02:32.186
* Come get what you wanted

02:32.220 --> 02:33.887
* Don't you stop
before you start it *

02:33.921 --> 02:35.523
* I'll give you every reason

02:35.556 --> 02:38.726
* Not to stop after we started,
come get *

02:38.759 --> 02:41.729
* What you wanted, don't you
stop before you start it... *

02:41.762 --> 02:44.031
-Yo, why don't you pass
the Cheetos, bro?
-I got you.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.499
* Not to stop after we started

02:45.533 --> 02:47.000
-Cheeto police.
-Here you go. All right.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.470
Yo, we need to be done,
and we're uploading this damn

02:49.503 --> 02:51.171
-song right now. I'm sorry. Yes.
-Word?
-Shut up.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.140
-About time.
-Let's go.
-Well, we better do it before

02:53.173 --> 02:55.175
-we change our minds.
-Literally. All right.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.645
-So...
-Let's go. Come on.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.880
-Come on...
-Yo, shut up. Damn.
-Go.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.550
All right.
No publicity, no money.

03:02.583 --> 03:05.319
-No money.
-Upload, upload, upload, upload.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.154
Upload, and...

03:07.187 --> 03:08.556
-uh, done.
-Yeah!

03:08.589 --> 03:11.158
-(whoops)
-Ain't no turning back now, yo.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.328
So, Poundcake died,
and Maya broke down.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.730
I mean, she was grieving
really hard,

03:16.764 --> 03:20.501
crying big tears,

03:20.534 --> 03:22.870
even though she didn't know her.

03:22.903 --> 03:27.107
When your mama goes,
it leaves a hole in your spirit.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.842
Didn't matter
that she didn't know her.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.712
Been living with that hole
inside of me

03:31.745 --> 03:34.081
most of my life.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.783
That hole...

03:35.816 --> 03:37.818
that hole goes both ways.

03:41.088 --> 03:44.224
I should not be smoking
around your heart.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.226
Candace told me.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.762
Yeah.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.098
Just like my daddy.
(chuckles)

03:51.131 --> 03:53.467
I'm hungry. You hungry?

03:53.501 --> 03:55.569
Okay, let me see.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.104
I've been juicing.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.473
-Oh. (chuckles)
-I haven't been to the market.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.475
I don't know what I've got.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.448
RENEE:
Hmm.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.950
These pictures are really nice.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.919
Very professional.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.121
Yeah. I teach, too.

04:14.154 --> 04:19.226
I can make you some toast.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.463
A lot of toast.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.064
You still take it with the...

04:24.097 --> 04:26.099
with the crust cut off the ends?

04:26.133 --> 04:29.236
This is a picture of me,
Candace, and Carol

04:29.269 --> 04:31.305
when we started that new school.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.240
How did you get...
these pictures?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.075
You weren't there.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.111
I-I mean, I remember this.
I-I remember this.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.581
I remember when we lived here.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.282
How did you get this?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.418
I have seen you all.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.154
After your daddy put
his hit out,

04:47.187 --> 04:48.822
the only way
that I could get close

04:48.856 --> 04:51.191
was with
a Leica telescopic lens.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.960
I didn't make every event,

04:52.993 --> 04:54.595
but when-when I could,

04:54.628 --> 04:57.598
I'd just find a little
hidey-hole to shoot from.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.534
It was the best I could do.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.970
Lolo?

05:03.003 --> 05:05.606
No one calls me that, you know.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.140
(Renee scoffs)

05:07.174 --> 05:09.710
I've been calling you that
since you were two.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.879
(sets picture down)

05:11.912 --> 05:13.381
(sighs)

05:13.414 --> 05:16.016
(laughs)

05:16.049 --> 05:19.286
I've been walking around
all my life...

05:19.319 --> 05:22.022
with this idea of who you were

05:22.055 --> 05:23.724
in my head, you know?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.025
(sighs)

05:26.694 --> 05:28.496
But I don't know you at all.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.031
I remember every step you took
up until second grade.

05:31.064 --> 05:35.403
And what your nosy sisters
been telling me recently.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.004
(chuckles)

05:37.037 --> 05:39.206
Well...
(clears throat)

05:39.239 --> 05:42.242
Carol is a mess,
I'm sure you know that by now.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.078
And Candace is...

05:45.112 --> 05:47.247
well, she's as...

05:47.280 --> 05:49.917
she's tight
as a padlocked Bible.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.284
(both laughing)

05:54.555 --> 05:57.925
And I'm on parole.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.261
So do you still think, um,

06:01.294 --> 06:03.063
I'm the one
that's most like you?

06:03.096 --> 06:06.734
I would like to find out,
grown girl.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.335
Woman.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.704
Come here.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.175
We cannot fix this quick.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.244
Hell, maybe never.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.279
That's a lot of lost time.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.515
-(softly): Yeah.
-Loretha, if...

06:21.549 --> 06:25.285
if there's any chance that...

06:25.318 --> 06:29.723
we could j-just have something,
anything...

06:29.757 --> 06:31.759
I want to try.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.093
-Me, too.
-Yeah?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.261
-Yeah.
-(laughs)

06:34.294 --> 06:35.963
(chuckles)

06:35.996 --> 06:37.431
Hmm.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.199
Oh.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.735
-My girl.
-(chuckles)

06:41.769 --> 06:43.571
THIRSTY:
So they scattered what was left

06:43.604 --> 06:45.706
of Little Big Man all over,

06:45.739 --> 06:47.775
wider than the A-train
can track.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.877
And the murder weapon
beyond that.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.146
That sounds like
a really good movie, man.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.882
I hope it ends well.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.383
It was fantastic.
I mean, it had everything.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.384
It'd make you laugh, make...

06:57.417 --> 06:59.419
(Thirsty clears throat)

07:01.288 --> 07:02.790
I've been calling you all night.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.224
Yeah, well, unfortunately,

07:04.257 --> 07:06.827
I've been
a little bit busy tonight.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.796
-(Lucious chuckles)
-Anika's been meeting

07:08.829 --> 07:10.397
with Empire's
most powerful board members.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.067
God, she's like
some reoccurring infection

07:14.101 --> 07:16.103
that just pops up
at the worst time.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.439
She's convincing them
to reject Eddie's resignation,

07:19.473 --> 07:20.474
and they're listening, Pop.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.843
We need to shore up our support

07:22.876 --> 07:25.412
right now, or Eddie will
be back, he will be untouchable.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.014
THIRSTY: If he sticks around,
he's gonna push

07:27.047 --> 07:29.249
the Patel deal through,
take Empire.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.918
ANDRE: That's right.
Now, I did a quick tally,

07:30.951 --> 07:33.654
and we should be safe, so long
as we have Shine's backing.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.523
(clears throat)

07:35.556 --> 07:37.290
Now, that's gonna be a problem.

07:37.324 --> 07:41.028
Shine has decided to take
a permanent vacation.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.897
And I think you know why.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.167
Do me a favor, son.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.937
When you enter into my room,
please shut the door.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.305
You didn't have to do that--

07:52.339 --> 07:54.374
I made sure
he wasn't a threat anymore.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.510
Really?

07:56.544 --> 08:00.113
Look, Andre, you got one
of the best minds around,

08:00.147 --> 08:02.315
and I know
that Ivy League education

08:02.349 --> 08:05.986
got you overconfident
about how you plan things out.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.388
But the school
that me and Shine came from,

08:08.421 --> 08:11.191
you don't start nothing
unless you plan to finish it--

08:11.224 --> 08:14.227
otherwise it will come back
and it will finish you.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.495
THIRSTY:
So...

08:15.529 --> 08:17.397
if we don't have Shine's vote,

08:17.430 --> 08:19.466
are we safe with him abstaining?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.535
It's as good
as a vote against us.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.904
The board seat will stay
within Shine's Nice-T division.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.874
His replacement
now controls the swing vote.

08:26.907 --> 08:30.744
Well, in that case, we just have
to control that replacement.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.245
We-we can't control anything

08:32.279 --> 08:34.247
until Shine
is declared dead, Pop.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.917
THIRSTY:
Kidding me.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.352
Um...

08:39.386 --> 08:41.722
Thirst, um...

08:41.755 --> 08:44.191
about that movie--
was there any way

08:44.224 --> 08:46.226
that they were able to put

08:46.259 --> 08:49.997
Humpty Dumpty
back together again?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.032
*

08:58.872 --> 09:01.008
No, Ma, I haven't read that one.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.210
Uh, "Black Women
and Heart Attacks."

09:03.243 --> 09:04.612
Okay, why don't you
send it to me.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.847
-Car's ready.
-Oh. Ma, we got to go.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.882
But I'll see you tomorrow. What?

09:08.916 --> 09:11.785
Why does Candace and Carol
have to c...

09:11.819 --> 09:14.221
Okay. I'll see you
tomorrow at lunch.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.423
Okay, bye-bye.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.626
-Which one?
-I already took

09:18.659 --> 09:20.728
the ACE inhibitor--
give me the aspirin.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.196
You know what I find
really cute?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.599
The fact that you and your mama
barely talked

09:25.633 --> 09:28.035
in over a quarter of a century,
and now y'all are on the phone

09:28.068 --> 09:29.236
-every five minutes.
-Mm.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.238
You know,
you can call your mother, too.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.540
They have phones
in the crazy house.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.775
-That ain't even funny.
-(chuckles)

09:34.808 --> 09:36.576
Come on, let's go.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.245
Are we okay, Lucious?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.614
The police still have
Shine's body.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.816
Look, we're headed
to his memorial.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.484
The police, they don't even know
where to start,

09:44.517 --> 09:46.253
'cause he had
so many doggone enemies.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.789
I mean, I promise you
our hands, my hands,

09:48.822 --> 09:51.759
are categorically... clean.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.927
Hmm. Well, that last song

09:53.961 --> 09:56.630
y'all did together makes you
seem like you're buddy-buddy.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.766
That was genius,
I'll give you that.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.333
Thank you.
Oh, don't forget,

10:00.367 --> 10:03.804
you've got to buddy up
with, uh, Tiffany.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.273
That's his baby mama,
the one that he married.

10:06.306 --> 10:10.177
Um, that way, we will have
a vote against Eddie.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.179
Right. Then we got
enough votes to bury

10:12.212 --> 10:14.081
any kind of reinstatement
of his ass,

10:14.114 --> 10:15.282
-that's right?
-Yes, indeed.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.817
Great. I know the plan, Lucious.

10:16.850 --> 10:17.985
I helped make it.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.352
Good. Well, come on.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.823
Mm.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.392
Come on, let's go.

10:30.563 --> 10:31.865
NESSA:
* Oh, oh

10:31.899 --> 10:33.934
* Oh, oh, oh

10:33.967 --> 10:35.669
* Yeah, yeah

10:35.703 --> 10:37.470
I'm so sorry.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.872
Thank you.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.041
He would have loved this.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.810
*

10:42.843 --> 10:45.512
* Mm, mm, mm, mm

10:45.545 --> 10:49.516
* I'll keep my head up high

10:49.549 --> 10:54.287
* Dry off these weeping eyes

10:54.321 --> 10:55.989
-* 'Cause I know
-Nessa was Shine's favorite.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.859
-* You're way up high
-He loved her voice.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.393
* Perfection

11:00.427 --> 11:02.495
-Hey, sweetheart.
-Hey.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.197
This is Tiffany,
the love of his life.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.733
Oh, hi.

11:05.766 --> 11:09.236
-I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.205
Those are his baby mamas
over there.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.074
He took care of all of 'em.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.710
-He was good like that.
-Hmm.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.678
* Lord knows we need

11:18.712 --> 11:20.814
* Some shine

11:20.848 --> 11:22.515
* Oh, oh, oh

11:22.549 --> 11:24.885
* But you've got your

11:24.918 --> 11:27.320
* Freedom...

11:27.354 --> 11:29.322
* Love was emergency

11:29.356 --> 11:31.424
* Now, love is eternity

11:31.458 --> 11:33.660
* But you've got your

11:33.693 --> 11:35.996
* Freedom...

11:36.029 --> 11:38.231
Poor Nessa.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.200
* But you're just the first
to see *

11:40.233 --> 11:43.336
So how's it feel to be
the Lone Ranger?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.939
What does that mean?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.440
Anonymous my ass.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.242
Becky, you better not snitch.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.780
You know I'm not gonna snitch.
This is a vault, but...

11:52.813 --> 11:54.347
it's just a matter of time until

11:54.381 --> 11:56.283
Cookie and Lucious find out,
and you know that.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.085
* Yeah, yeah

11:58.118 --> 12:02.756
(vocalizing)

12:02.790 --> 12:05.458
* Freedom

12:05.492 --> 12:09.429
* Ooh...

12:12.732 --> 12:14.134
I love you, Shine.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.604
This was beautiful.

12:17.637 --> 12:21.108
Uh, are we supposed to clap
at a memorial?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.243
LUCIOUS:
I mean, she was really good.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.445
I don't know.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.780
(crying)

12:29.917 --> 12:32.319
She better turn
her big-head ass around.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.154
I can't stand that heifer.

12:34.187 --> 12:38.158
You made that relatively clear
when you rearranged her face.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.727
-Mm. She deserved it.
-Mm-hmm.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.796
(sniffles)

12:52.372 --> 12:54.574
LUCIOUS: I don't know
if y'all knew this, but, um,

12:54.607 --> 12:57.911
Shine was
my oldest living friend.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.180
He was my colleague,

13:00.213 --> 13:02.515
a partner at Empire,

13:02.549 --> 13:05.118
and a genius
at spotting new talent.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.119
-WOMAN: That's right.
-MAN: For real.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.189
To everybody else, Blake...

13:09.222 --> 13:11.491
was a crazy little white boy
with a bad haircut.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.327
But he saw
the diamond in the rough,

13:14.361 --> 13:18.832
and he polished that diamond
with his last drop of blood.

13:18.866 --> 13:22.602
He made his last record
with that diamond.

13:22.635 --> 13:27.941
I was proud of his genius,
and I'm gonna miss my friend.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.642
-WOMAN: Rest in peace.
-We love you.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.279
ANIKA: And can you imagine
just how wonderful

13:32.312 --> 13:34.314
Tiana's been doing?
Honestly,

13:34.347 --> 13:37.851
I was the one that did discover
and sign her, but Eddie...

13:37.885 --> 13:42.222
Wow, he instinctively knew
what to do next.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.557
* If I had to play God
for a day *

13:44.591 --> 13:46.894
* I would open up the gates,
let the world see my face *

13:46.927 --> 13:50.463
I really should've let Shine
hit it when I had the chance to.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.499
I should've just let him
have it.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.833
* A safe place

13:53.867 --> 13:56.836
Okay.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.372
* I'd let their mamas know
that they okay *

13:59.406 --> 14:01.808
* And when y'all pray,
I'll respond so that *

14:01.841 --> 14:03.676
* You all can see a sign

14:03.710 --> 14:05.078
* And answer every prayer
one at a time *

14:05.112 --> 14:07.014
* If I'm God, huh

14:07.047 --> 14:08.681
* All the stabbings, all the war
would come to cease *

14:08.715 --> 14:11.751
Dre, I can't imagine
how you feel, man. I...

14:11.784 --> 14:13.653
I know, you and Shine,
y'all worked together.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.022
Y'all were friends.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.556
It was something like that.

14:16.589 --> 14:17.857
* Screams of people
being smoked *

14:17.891 --> 14:19.092
* No more dope,
you don't need it *

14:19.126 --> 14:20.527
All death is bad news

14:20.560 --> 14:22.662
to somebody somewhere, man,
you know?

14:22.695 --> 14:27.100
I wondered if Rhonda's death
would ever get... easier.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.601
* Laughed at the picture

14:28.635 --> 14:30.537
It doesn't.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.906
We weren't there for you,
were we?

14:32.940 --> 14:35.842
* Who pulls the strings
of the world *

14:35.875 --> 14:39.012
* As we struggle today

14:39.046 --> 14:40.880
Dre, I miss you.

14:40.914 --> 14:44.084
* I don't want to wait,
wait, wait till I die *

14:44.117 --> 14:45.218
Love you, Dre.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.088
* Wait, wait, wait for my eyes

14:48.121 --> 14:50.123
I love you, too, man.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.524
* Smile on your child
so he knows *

14:51.558 --> 14:53.526
I love you, too.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.362
* God has a face

14:55.395 --> 14:57.064
* Just imagine
if the devil had a day *

14:57.097 --> 14:59.232
* And God had took a break
and walked away... *

14:59.266 --> 15:01.368
-Hey, Keem.
-Another one.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.603
I know that this might be
a really hard time,

15:03.636 --> 15:05.638
but I actually have
some good news for you.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.407
What's up?

15:07.440 --> 15:10.077
So, there's this movie,
Down By Day,

15:10.110 --> 15:11.244
it's shooting downtown.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.080
And Big Fade-- he had, like,

15:13.113 --> 15:15.882
a small
but really important role in it.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.952
And, as you know,
he got his ass locked up again.

15:18.986 --> 15:22.455
So the producers
reached out to me

15:22.489 --> 15:24.257
so that I can reach out to you

15:24.291 --> 15:27.127
to see if you want to take over
the role for him.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.232
Mm'kay. Did I mention that

15:32.265 --> 15:34.067
Haven Wynn is starring in it?

15:34.101 --> 15:36.403
The chick from Star Worlds?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.905
Yeah, and number three
on my girl-crush list.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.640
Tell 'em hell yeah, I'm in.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.809
Okay, great.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.577
Uh, just want to make sure,

15:44.611 --> 15:46.346
because they need you this week,

15:46.379 --> 15:49.449
and you have House Empire,
and so it's a lot.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.783
I can do both.

15:50.817 --> 15:55.255
You're in. All right.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.390
Let me get another one.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.461
Thank you for having
Shine's memorial here.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.196
It means a lot.

16:03.230 --> 16:07.434
I know the two of you
got into it sometimes, but...

16:07.467 --> 16:09.502
Yeah, but we were brothers,
and, like brothers,

16:09.536 --> 16:11.838
sometimes we disagreed,
but there was nothing

16:11.871 --> 16:13.873
I wouldn't do for him
or for you and your family.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.942
-How are you all?
-We're doing all right.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.644
You know Shine took care of me.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.513
It's these other baby mamas
I'm worried about.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.682
Now they all got their hands
out, looking to get paid.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.651
I'm really sorry for your loss.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.885
Oh, thank you.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.020
I'm Eddie Barker.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.655
I worked with your husband.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.224
He was a real force of nature
around here at Empire.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.525
I appreciate that.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.694
And I think that there's
an emergency fund

16:34.727 --> 16:38.231
that we can dip into
to help calm those ladies down

16:38.265 --> 16:39.566
during their hours of grief.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.335
Only one of us represents
Empire, and that's me.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.337
I'll take care of that
if need be.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.972
I'm offering to help.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.707
WOMAN:
Tiffany, we need you.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.309
Jade and Sierra are ramping up

16:49.342 --> 16:51.678
about their kids, and it's...
it's about to get ugly.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.846
-I'll be right back.
-Mm-hmm.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.356
It's not too late
to fix this thing.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.693
Let's just say we take
the Kelly Patel deal,

17:06.726 --> 17:09.696
and then we can all go off
and chill in Turks and Caicos.

17:09.729 --> 17:13.032
My family and I trusted you,

17:13.066 --> 17:15.768
and still you're trying
to sell our company

17:15.802 --> 17:17.770
like it's a slave at an auction.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.339
There's no slave at an auction
that's worth

17:19.372 --> 17:21.040
hundreds of millions of dollars,
my man.

17:21.074 --> 17:24.677
Stay away fr...
If I see you at House Empire...

17:24.711 --> 17:28.047
Look, you mean the little show
to celebrate the 20 For 20

17:28.081 --> 17:30.950
that you wouldn't have
if it wasn't for me?

17:30.983 --> 17:33.520
TIFFANY:
I'm sorry about that.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.888
Oh, no problem.
I'll talk to you later and see

17:35.922 --> 17:37.224
if I can work
those things out for you.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.925
Thank you.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.630
Forgive me

17:43.663 --> 17:45.432
for this moment,
I know it must seem rude,

17:45.465 --> 17:47.200
but we got to talk
about business.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.737
We need to discuss you filling
Shine's seat at the board.

17:50.770 --> 17:55.608
Me? Oh, no, uh,
business ain't my thing.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.278
Shine always said that if
anything ever happened to him,

17:58.311 --> 18:00.547
that his board seat
and all of his business

18:00.580 --> 18:02.014
be taken over by Nessa.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.785
Nessa?

18:08.688 --> 18:11.057
Chicken, I'm tellin' you,
they gave me my own P.A.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.625
They treatin' me right.
I got my own trailer...

18:12.659 --> 18:13.726
Uh, this is the director,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.562
-Mr. Lyon.
-I got to go.

18:15.595 --> 18:19.065
Oh, keep it, sir. It's my job.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.468
Mr. Lyon, welcome.
I'm Beekman Poser.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.969
I'm the director
of this picture,

18:23.002 --> 18:25.505
and we're very glad
that you are in it.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.608
Thanks so much for responding
on such short notice.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.009
Of course,
you know our star, Haven?

18:31.511 --> 18:33.313
And, oh, listen, Hakeesh...

18:33.346 --> 18:35.848
-It's Hakeem.
-You two get acquainted.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.116
We're shooting
a love scene later today.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.219
It's all about chemistry, right?

18:41.188 --> 18:44.791
I seen your last movie.
It was a'ight.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.994
A'ight? Thanks a lot.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.662
Look, I was just trying to...

18:49.696 --> 18:50.963
Trying to be friendly?

18:50.997 --> 18:52.465
(scoffs)
You're here for one day.

18:52.499 --> 18:53.800
We're not gonna be friends.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.768
Cool.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.705
Oh, and as for the love scene,

18:58.738 --> 19:00.707
no tongue whatsoever,

19:00.740 --> 19:02.542
and keep your hands
in the PG zones.

19:02.575 --> 19:07.280
I'm not one of your video hos.
A'ight?

19:07.314 --> 19:09.048
It was lovely to meet you.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.892
(Andre sighs)

19:19.926 --> 19:23.162
All my life, I've-I've had
to compartmentalize.

19:23.196 --> 19:27.934
It was the only way to survive
the swings in my mind.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.870
When I see Anika,

19:30.903 --> 19:34.140
when I see her-her face,

19:34.173 --> 19:36.876
everything goes out the window.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.846
All I feel is pure hatred.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.682
I want to be well.

19:42.715 --> 19:46.519
I feel like my hate for her
is gonna destroy me.

19:46.553 --> 19:50.423
The only thing I know
more powerful than hate

19:50.457 --> 19:52.191
is the power to forgive.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.961
She doesn't deserve it.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.699
Forgiveness
is about the forgiver, Andre.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.235
Your brother forgave you,
didn't he?

20:02.269 --> 20:05.004
Hmm?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.873
Did you deserve it?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.943
You have the power to forgive.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.280
It's in you.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.921
You know what,
let's just go ahead and run this

20:21.954 --> 20:23.256
while the crew sets up.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.692
Hakeem, you enter, gun drawn,
to find Haven

20:25.725 --> 20:27.460
tied up in the warehouse.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.562
-All right.
-Okay? Start over there.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.631
-Let's do it.
-Great.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.070
Brandi,
we got to get out of here.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.606
Thank God.
There's a bomb.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.073
-Yeah, we got to go. Come on.
-Cut!

20:41.107 --> 20:42.975
I had two more lines.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.545
Yes, yes.

20:45.578 --> 20:49.248
Um... Hey, Hakeem,
have you ever acted before?

20:49.282 --> 20:50.717
Not really.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.952
-Okay. Well, relax.
-(scoffs)

20:52.985 --> 20:54.554
Make it sound natural.
You know?

20:54.587 --> 20:57.624
Like, say the lines
like you would in real life.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.326
Let's try it again.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.638
Damn! We got to get out of here.
Come on, Brandi. Let's go!

21:11.671 --> 21:13.105
Cut!

21:13.139 --> 21:15.908
What, Beekman? You want me
more scared or less scared?

21:15.942 --> 21:18.144
That just wasn't natural.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.278
The character's a rapper.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.414
I need you to sound
like a rapper. Okay?

21:21.448 --> 21:22.815
-I am a rapper.
-Mm, uh,

21:22.849 --> 21:24.283
mess up some of the words.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.018
Slur a few of them, like you're
probably high on something.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.920
Also, the Glock.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.188
Turn it on its side, pinkie up,

21:29.221 --> 21:31.624
like a rapper does, you know?

21:31.658 --> 21:33.460
Uh-huh.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.761
Don't nobody do that.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.496
Who cares?
Just do what he says.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.930
I don't want to be here
all night.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.799
Great.
Let's try it again.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.339
-Can we get this room, please?
-Mm-hmm.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.611
Well, this ought to be good.

21:51.644 --> 21:52.945
You know why we're here.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.114
Yes, Anika reached out already.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.650
And, apparently, everybody needs
a piece of my vote,

21:57.684 --> 21:59.452
and she was very convincing.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.987
And she didn't lay hands on me.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.456
Well, that's because
she lacks follow-through,

22:03.490 --> 22:05.257
and you should be concerned
about that.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.028
Okay. What-what is it?

22:09.061 --> 22:10.229
You need an apology?

22:10.262 --> 22:11.864
No, I don't.

22:11.898 --> 22:12.999
So you can save your breath

22:13.032 --> 22:14.200
for your concession speech
to the board.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.302
Look, N-Nessa, I'm the one

22:16.335 --> 22:17.570
that should be apologizing,
okay?

22:17.604 --> 22:18.871
(whispers indistinctly)

22:19.872 --> 22:21.974
(Andre sighs)

22:22.008 --> 22:23.576
I was a mess
while we were together.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.579
I wanted so badly to be ready
to move on after Rhonda's death

22:26.613 --> 22:30.049
that I never took the time
to actually grieve it.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.719
And you suffered for that.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.522
You didn't deserve it.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.524
I'm sorry.

22:37.557 --> 22:41.561
Don't make my family suffer
for what I did. Please.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.530
Because you need me now.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.433
Don't you think you're a little
too late for this speech?

22:46.466 --> 22:47.700
Huh, Dre?

22:47.734 --> 22:49.235
All right, all right.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.437
Nessa, listen.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.604
We didn't do right by you,

22:51.638 --> 22:53.573
none of us did.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.241
But I can fix that, right now.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.044
We'll extend your contract
for two more albums,

22:58.077 --> 23:01.247
plus a huge signing bonus.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.216
All you have to say is yes.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.718
And how do I know
you all are gonna

23:05.752 --> 23:07.554
put anything behind me
this time?

23:07.587 --> 23:10.056
-Tell her.
-Because we're going
to offer you

23:10.089 --> 23:13.926
the final spot
in our House Empire showcase.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.228
Wait, that's Jamal's spot.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.130
Yeah, well,
Jamal is not here right now.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.900
I mean, is that enough
of a commitment for you?

23:20.933 --> 23:22.769
I-It's something that'll make
the entire industry

23:22.802 --> 23:25.772
sit up and take notice.

23:26.839 --> 23:30.242
Nessa, I've known Shine
my entire life.

23:30.276 --> 23:32.545
But when I watched him walk
inside that booth

23:32.579 --> 23:36.282
and release
all those years of emotion

23:36.315 --> 23:38.918
and pent up anger,

23:38.951 --> 23:42.021
it was like meeting him
for the very first time, and...

23:43.656 --> 23:46.826
...it was beautiful.

23:46.859 --> 23:50.563
And what devastated me was
the thought that maybe I'm...

23:50.597 --> 23:53.566
I'm never gonna see that again.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.802
But I know I can, with you.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.772
Do you know who killed Shine,
Lucious?

23:59.806 --> 24:02.241
LUCIOUS: My brother had
a whole lot of enemies.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.743
But I promise you,

24:03.776 --> 24:07.179
I will use every resource I have

24:07.213 --> 24:09.782
to find out who hurt him,

24:09.816 --> 24:12.985
and I will make them pay,
the way Shine would.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.222
I hope so.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.761
All right, I will help you,

24:21.794 --> 24:24.497
because I feel like that's
what Shine would want me to do.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.965
Thank you.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.535
We're gonna make this right,
I promise you.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.303
I'm gonna make this right.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.942
-Thanks, Regina.
-Mm-hmm.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.511
-May I help you?
-Hi. Can I have moo shu
chicken fried rice?

24:38.545 --> 24:40.479
They got the best egg rolls
in town.

24:40.513 --> 24:43.883
I can't believe
she listened to his lying ass.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.285
We are screwed without Nessa.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.521
A coup is not a coup
without a majority.

24:48.555 --> 24:52.959
Why are we plotting a bloodless
coup under cover of darkness?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.795
The key is to wage war
out in the daylight.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.830
Yeah, but, see, there's
so much dirt out in public

24:57.864 --> 24:59.666
on the Lyons already

24:59.699 --> 25:01.167
that the press
doesn't get shocked anymore.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.368
Not with the artists.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.136
I want you to find me

25:04.170 --> 25:06.739
the sins committed by
every single 20 For 20 artist.

25:06.773 --> 25:09.475
The Lyons' House Empire?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.277
I'm gonna destroy that.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.651
(helicopter whirring)

25:18.685 --> 25:20.987
(siren wailing)

25:21.020 --> 25:22.655
HAKEEM:
Hey, yo.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.691
I told you I'd be back.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.062
-POSER: Cut! Cut.
-(bell rings)

25:30.096 --> 25:31.530
What'd I do wrong?

25:31.564 --> 25:33.766
It's-it's not, uh, about doing,

25:33.800 --> 25:35.267
it's about acting.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.703
And being bold enough

25:36.736 --> 25:40.006
to share that ugly essence
with the world.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.674
Let's see your walk.
Can we see your walk?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.209
Just back up, right there.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.212
Let's see your walk.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.747
Great. Mm-hmm.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.249
And-- yes, yeah. Right.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.619
But more. More, more passion,

25:52.652 --> 25:53.720
more rage.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.054
Bring all your black into it.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.523
Let your guard down, H.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.527
Look, I know you've been taught
to keep the beast in check,

26:01.560 --> 26:04.897
but, on my set,
Black Lives Matter.

26:04.931 --> 26:07.033
-What?
-Do what I do, okay?

26:07.066 --> 26:10.269
You know, hang a hand down low,

26:10.302 --> 26:12.705
just slide right in there,
knees bent,

26:12.739 --> 26:15.642
and just bounce like you got
Snoop Dogg playing in your head.

26:15.675 --> 26:16.709
-Snoop Dogg?
-Mm-hmm.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.410
-Cut.
-You cut?

26:18.444 --> 26:21.147
No. You don't cut.
I'm the director.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.382
I don't care who you are,
I'm not doing that.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.252
Don't no black man act like that
except for inside your head.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.754
Well, there's no need
to get hostile, Hakkum.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.956
It's Hakeem. Get it right.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.591
Um, would you please escort
Mr. Lyon to his trailer?

26:32.625 --> 26:33.860
HAKEEM:
I know where it is.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.964
Uh, Hikkeem Lyon?

26:37.997 --> 26:39.365
You are fired.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.971
Let's see
if we can get Jaden Smith.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.438
(scoffs)

26:46.472 --> 26:48.908
These rappers.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.910
RENEE:
I just want to make sure

26:50.943 --> 26:53.079
that you girls know
you got to be

26:53.112 --> 26:54.681
in charge of your own money...

26:54.714 --> 26:57.249
-Mm-hmm.
-...and your own orgasms.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.185
-Ooh! Oh!
-(laughter)

26:59.218 --> 27:01.654
You bad, you bad.

27:01.688 --> 27:04.290
-Mom, you are crazy.
-You are.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.925
Ah, this is heaven.

27:05.958 --> 27:10.162
This is heaven, being here
with... with my girls.

27:10.196 --> 27:13.265
You pretty girls,
together again.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.466
-Amen.
-CAROL: Ah.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.035
Amen, Mama.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.037
-And this food is so delicious.
-Mmm!

27:18.070 --> 27:19.872
And healthy.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.640
Yeah, Juanita wasn't having it
when Lucious brought

27:21.674 --> 27:24.043
all those chefs up in here,
cooking all these vegan meals

27:24.076 --> 27:25.845
all up in her kitchen.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.446
-(laughter)
-And you know it.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.282
You know, this food reminds me
of that restaurant

27:30.316 --> 27:31.784
that we went to, in Charleston?

27:31.818 --> 27:34.020
-Lowcountry.
-When you had
your photo exhibit.

27:34.053 --> 27:37.456
Oh, those photos
of the Gullah islands, amazing.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.557
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.626
You-you had an exhibit?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.461
-Mm-hmm.
-And y'all went?

27:42.494 --> 27:43.696
-Yeah.
-CAROL: Yeah.

27:43.730 --> 27:44.997
Next time, we'll all go,

27:45.031 --> 27:46.999
-since we all talking.
-Yes, we will.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.201
However, now I am focused
mainly on my teaching.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.304
Oh. But you'll still travel,
won't you, Mom?

27:52.338 --> 27:53.840
I wouldn't give that part up.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.175
Right. How many more countries
you got on your list, Mama?

27:56.208 --> 28:00.379
I don't know, but I'm-I'm pretty
well into my second passport.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.014
CANDACE (fading):
Ooh, well, la-dee-da.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.250
I tried to see you.
I tried to stay in your lives.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.484
You tried?
You tried really hard.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.853
Your daddy, your daddy wouldn't

28:06.886 --> 28:08.520
-let me see you.
-You tried?

28:08.554 --> 28:12.158
You chose high yellow trash
over your boys.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.659
Shut up!

28:13.692 --> 28:16.495
So you think
what you did was hard,

28:16.528 --> 28:18.064
and you think this is easy?

28:18.097 --> 28:21.734
-(laughter)
-I guess being away from us

28:21.768 --> 28:23.235
gave you a lot of freedom, huh?

28:23.269 --> 28:24.837
Being kept from the three of you

28:24.871 --> 28:27.406
gave me a lot of alone time.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.540
Mm-hmm.

28:28.574 --> 28:31.110
I discovered
life should be lived.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.611
Apparently.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.250
I remember when you were six--
I don't know if you do--

28:38.284 --> 28:41.353
you had this big map
of the world on the wall,

28:41.387 --> 28:44.523
above your bed,
and she used to stick pins in it

28:44.556 --> 28:47.626
to all the places that she was
gonna go, when you got a bike.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.896
-Oh.
-I remember that. (laughs)

28:49.929 --> 28:52.899
And I guess
the only places I went

28:52.932 --> 28:54.033
was from cell block
to cell block.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.101
Huh? Is that your point?

28:55.134 --> 28:57.369
No. That's not the point.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.305
That's not
what she meant, Loretha.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.306
CAROL:
Why don't you hush up, Cook?

29:00.339 --> 29:01.540
Ease up a little bit.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.875
All right? Why do you have to...

29:02.909 --> 29:04.276
Hey.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.779
You and Lucious
should take a grand tour.

29:06.813 --> 29:09.381
-I could help you plan
something.
-That's an excellent idea, Mom.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.983
COOKIE:
Excellent idea. And I think

29:11.017 --> 29:14.286
you should come along as
the in-house photographer. Yeah?

29:16.755 --> 29:17.957
I have real work to do.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.959
Why don't y'all finish up?

29:19.992 --> 29:21.794
Mom, I'm sorry.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.562
That's okay. Don't worry.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.597
-I'll be back, I'll be back.
-I'm sorry, Mom.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.168
RENEE:
Hey. Hey, hussy.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.571
You getting hot
for nothing, Lolo.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.840
Stop calling me that.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.641
And since when did you know
or care

29:35.674 --> 29:37.443
about what I get mad about?

29:37.476 --> 29:39.245
Huh? All you care about
is Carol, Candace,

29:39.278 --> 29:42.248
-taking pictures, and traveling.
-(laughs)

29:42.281 --> 29:44.750
The hell is so funny?

29:44.783 --> 29:47.619
You been on a tear
since you were five years old.

29:47.653 --> 29:50.789
My dear, jealous heart.

29:50.823 --> 29:54.693
You said, that day in prison,
that you wouldn't give up on me.

29:54.726 --> 29:55.962
Well, you lied.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.596
I did not.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.797
That was your choice.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.199
I was in prison. Okay?

30:00.232 --> 30:02.501
Daddy was dead,
Carol was on drugs,

30:02.534 --> 30:06.038
and Candace, well,
Candace is just a bitch!

30:06.072 --> 30:08.540
A-And you, you just took off
globetrotting.

30:08.574 --> 30:09.909
I came to you.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.145
You said no.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.614
You left a hole in my heart.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.149
I found something to fill it.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.651
You don't get to blame me
for that.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.955
(sighs)

30:22.989 --> 30:24.556
I'm here.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.960
I'm here right now, Loretha,

30:27.994 --> 30:30.696
wanting to know you.

30:30.729 --> 30:32.965
I-I'm willing to step

30:32.999 --> 30:35.401
on a few landmines,
if that's what it takes.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.470
But I need to know
that you are in this with me.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.941
Maybe I'm tired
of stepping on landmines.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.021
(knocks)

30:55.054 --> 30:56.688
I just told y'all
to back off, man.

30:56.722 --> 30:58.624
-I need some time.
-Can I come up?

31:03.529 --> 31:04.997
Why?

31:05.031 --> 31:06.698
So you can laugh at me up close?

31:07.766 --> 31:08.867
Steal my snacks?

31:08.901 --> 31:09.969
Here, take 'em.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.674
You know, it was brave,
what you did back there.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.010
-Yeah, whatever.
-No, seriously.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.346
I meet directors like Poser
all of the time.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.950
They're just whitesplaining this
and that, and, after a point,

31:23.983 --> 31:27.419
I just tune them out,
get the job done, get paid.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.255
But you didn't sell out.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.857
And I admire that.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.592
I've been fired a lot lately.

31:33.625 --> 31:34.927
Fired by Poser,

31:34.961 --> 31:36.728
fired by my girl.

31:36.762 --> 31:39.398
I wouldn't fire you.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.601
Well, if you like
what you've seen today,

31:42.634 --> 31:44.303
come see what I really do.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.939
I might like that.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.313
COOKIE: When I first announced
20 For 20,

31:54.346 --> 31:57.816
a lot of people, uh,
doubted the possibility.

31:57.849 --> 32:01.920
Yeah, it was a big risk,
but I had to.

32:01.954 --> 32:04.890
And, um, I did it without
Lucious standing beside me.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.826
-To the Empire.
-ALL: To the Empire.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.828
I believed then,
just like I believe now,

32:09.861 --> 32:13.899
that Empire's legacy is-is worth
that kind of celebration.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.268
-(cheering, applause)
-You know, it's a legacy

32:16.302 --> 32:20.339
that could have only been built
by the blood, sweat,

32:20.372 --> 32:23.242
and a hell of a lot of tears
of a strong family.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.677
Hmm. So how did we do?

32:25.711 --> 32:29.681
Well, you've got to keep in mind
that Empire has managed

32:29.715 --> 32:33.519
to avoid all
of the downward industry trends.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.422
-You know, over 20 albums?
-Hmm.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.490
And, uh, to celebrate it
all under one roof,

32:38.524 --> 32:43.362
we're launching
one huge, spectacular event.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.131
It's the culmination
of our 20 For 20,

32:45.164 --> 32:48.534
and it's
a signature Lyon creation:

32:48.567 --> 32:50.036
House Empire.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.337
INTERVIEWER:
So you're tying this event

32:51.370 --> 32:53.339
specifically to the Lyon family?

32:53.372 --> 32:54.773
Well... well, I mean,

32:54.806 --> 32:58.044
without the Lyon family,
there is no Empire.

32:58.077 --> 33:01.213
INTERVIEWER: But Jamal's
not listed as having a room.

33:01.247 --> 33:02.481
Where's his 20 For 20 album?

33:02.514 --> 33:04.783
COOKIE: Well, Jamal had
one hell of a year...

33:04.816 --> 33:06.685
-(gunshot)
-...so, he's, uh...

33:06.718 --> 33:07.986
taking a break.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.888
You know, at Empire,

33:09.921 --> 33:13.059
the artist's-- and, certainly,
my child's-- health comes first.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.961
Yep. But in his absence
and with his blessing,

33:15.994 --> 33:18.830
we are using
this opportunity to, uh,

33:18.864 --> 33:21.633
introduce the next generation
of talent

33:21.667 --> 33:23.069
into the world.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.836
-(cheering)
-Well,

33:24.870 --> 33:28.240
at House Empire, you're going
to be able to experience that

33:28.274 --> 33:33.045
in a way that no one's
ever experienced music before.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.081
That's great.
Give me a minute.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.749
-We just need
to change the battery.
-Okay.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.987
(whispers):
This is gonna work, right?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.922
Yeah. You're doing great, babe.

33:43.955 --> 33:46.792
HAKEEM: * Empire, we came from
the bottom on to the top! *

33:49.628 --> 33:53.031
* Whoo,
20 years never looked better *

33:53.065 --> 33:55.401
-(roaring)
-* Bought a brand-new panorama,
sold my soul to the devil *

33:55.434 --> 33:57.603
* You can call me Mr. Greatest

33:57.636 --> 33:59.105
* On a whole nother level...

33:59.138 --> 34:00.872
Uh, no.
Your entrance is that way.

34:00.906 --> 34:03.575
-Beat it. Bye.
-Are you serious? We're supposed
to be on the list.

34:03.609 --> 34:04.843
MAN:
Look, it's Cookie and Lucious!

34:04.876 --> 34:06.745
COOKIE:
Hey, everybody. Don't worry.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.080
You will get pictures
on the inside.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.781
-(lively chatter)
-WOMAN: Love you, Lucious!

34:09.815 --> 34:10.782
(laughs)

34:12.784 --> 34:14.453
Y'all, this is amazing.

34:14.486 --> 34:17.423
-Mm, I'm so proud of you.
-What would be amazing
is if you were

34:17.456 --> 34:20.392
-participating in this thing.
-Uh, look, we ain't got time
for that drama in here.

34:20.426 --> 34:23.229
-It's all right.
-Hello! Welcome to House Empire.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.697
-(roaring)
-Uh, little advice:
be careful of those lions.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.266
You know, they bite.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.967
-Really hard.
-MAN: All right, y'all,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.637
Tiana's room
is about to go live!

34:31.670 --> 34:34.072
(percussive beat playing)

34:34.106 --> 34:35.407
(cheering)

34:42.481 --> 34:44.216
* Ah, ah

34:44.250 --> 34:46.252
* Can't you look at me
and see that I love ya *

34:46.285 --> 34:47.319
* Ah

34:47.353 --> 34:48.820
* And I'll do anything for ya

34:48.854 --> 34:51.757
* Jump into the mouth
of a volcano *

34:51.790 --> 34:54.059
* Race into the wind
beside an eagle *

34:54.092 --> 34:56.262
-MAN: You the man, Hakeem!
-Yeah! You already know!

34:56.295 --> 34:57.796
WOMAN:
We love you, Haven!

34:57.829 --> 35:00.499
MAN: Hey, Haven Wynn!
What's up, girl?

35:00.532 --> 35:02.268
* Without a rope,
dive into the Bermuda *

35:02.301 --> 35:03.969
-(roaring)
-* Without a boat

35:04.002 --> 35:05.271
Welcome to my world, baby.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.105
It looks a lot like mine.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.175
Is that the girlfriend
who fired you?

35:09.208 --> 35:10.776
* Can't you see that I love ya

35:10.809 --> 35:12.444
* Look at me
and see that I love ya *

35:12.478 --> 35:14.280
Maybe.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.914
* And lightning

35:15.947 --> 35:17.849
* We were meant to be

35:17.883 --> 35:19.418
"Maybe" my ass.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.952
Look at the way
you're watching her.

35:20.986 --> 35:22.454
* Where I belong

35:22.488 --> 35:23.922
You're hooked.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.791
* Lightning

35:25.824 --> 35:27.626
* You're a part of me

35:27.659 --> 35:29.195
* Wrapped up inside your arms

35:29.228 --> 35:31.163
* That's right where I belong

35:31.197 --> 35:32.864
* And I ain't goin' nowhere

35:32.898 --> 35:36.468
* Said I ain't goin' nowhere

35:36.502 --> 35:37.936
* 'Cause I'm-a be right here,
right here *

35:37.969 --> 35:40.005
* Right here, right here,
right here *

35:40.038 --> 35:41.873
* Right here,
right here, right here, hey *

35:41.907 --> 35:44.710
* Can't you look at me
and see that I love ya *

35:44.743 --> 35:47.679
-What is this?
-Oh!

35:47.713 --> 35:50.148
* The king of the jungle

35:50.182 --> 35:52.551
* Anything for my baby,
that's how I roll *

35:52.584 --> 35:54.620
* Can't you see that I need ya

35:54.653 --> 35:56.555
* Ooh, do anything
to please ya *

35:56.588 --> 35:57.889
Don't worry about them, boo.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.058
Show him what he missing, girl.
Show him what he missing.

36:00.091 --> 36:01.893
Yes, give me Janet, honey,
give me Janet.

36:01.927 --> 36:02.961
* Joke

36:02.994 --> 36:04.963
* Joke...

36:04.996 --> 36:06.798
* Oh, oh

36:06.832 --> 36:08.800
* Can't you see that I love ya

36:08.834 --> 36:11.470
* Look at me
and see that I love ya *

36:11.503 --> 36:14.473
* Like thunder and lightning

36:14.506 --> 36:16.708
* We were meant to be...

36:16.742 --> 36:18.310
RENEE: But what you're wearing
is better.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.878
It's very Peter Max

36:19.911 --> 36:21.813
-and kind of Pucci.
-Who is that?

36:21.847 --> 36:23.315
-What's your name?
-Who? Porsha, I'm Porsha.

36:23.349 --> 36:25.517
-(roaring)
-(screams)

36:25.551 --> 36:27.319
It's okay. It's fake.

36:27.353 --> 36:30.756
Now, what you need to be worried
about is the people around here.

36:30.789 --> 36:33.692
Speaking of, hey, girl,
here's Cookie now. Good luck.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.561
COOKIE: I need you to go get
those papers for me. Okay.

36:35.594 --> 36:36.595
You, with me.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.564
RENEE:
Hey.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.031
Thanks for inviting me.

36:40.065 --> 36:41.767
Well, I figured
if you wanted to get to know me,

36:41.800 --> 36:43.769
this would be
a good place to start.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.538
Oh, that'd be wonderful.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.073
Okay, follow me.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.941
You see this?

36:49.975 --> 36:52.378
You hear this? You feel this?

36:52.411 --> 36:54.713
This is all me--
every note, every song

36:54.746 --> 36:56.882
is Cookie Lyon.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.050
You always had fire, Lolo.

36:59.084 --> 37:01.620
Yeah, well,
Lolo put the pins in the map,

37:01.653 --> 37:03.955
but it was Cookie's blood,
sweat, and tears

37:03.989 --> 37:05.924
that built this.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.959
Yeah, me and Lucious.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.895
* I just want you to...

37:09.928 --> 37:12.598
You know, I always thought
I was who I was

37:12.631 --> 37:14.933
in spite of the fact
that you weren't there,

37:14.966 --> 37:16.935
but now I think
it's the opposite.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.304
I'm strong,

37:18.337 --> 37:21.039
smart, successful,

37:21.072 --> 37:22.908
fierce.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.911
I love hard, and I'm hungry.

37:25.944 --> 37:29.281
And that hunger came
from not having a mother.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.983
But that hunger...

37:32.017 --> 37:33.552
kept me alive.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.754
So I should thank you,

37:35.787 --> 37:37.723
because this...

37:37.756 --> 37:39.658
(sighs):
this...

37:39.691 --> 37:43.895
is how I fill
the hole you left in my heart.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.399
* Why do I even bother

37:47.433 --> 37:49.301
Oh. Boys.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.770
Come here and meet your G-ma.

37:51.803 --> 37:52.971
* You call yourself...

37:57.108 --> 37:58.944
I am so proud of you...

37:58.977 --> 38:01.279
Cookie.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.585
Well, why y'all standing there
looking stupid?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.354
Come over here,
introduce yourselves.

38:08.387 --> 38:11.056
(chuckles)
I got work to do.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.703
(sobbing):
My name is Renee.

38:25.471 --> 38:28.039
(stammers, kisses)

38:30.241 --> 38:32.277
* You're so...

38:32.310 --> 38:34.880
Thank you for being here.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.382
What you all need
to understand is,

38:36.415 --> 38:38.183
after the attack on my life,

38:38.216 --> 38:41.553
I thought that I would
never be able to appreciate

38:41.587 --> 38:44.055
or-- no, no, no,
let 'em through, please--

38:44.089 --> 38:46.224
-appreciate music again.
-That's where Hakeem

38:46.257 --> 38:48.560
will be performing later.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.829
-And then we have Tiana.
-LUCIOUS: It all disappeared,
and it was just a...

38:50.862 --> 38:52.731
cornucopia of chaos to me.

38:52.764 --> 38:56.568
-Oh, my gosh,
this is really gorgeous.
-Yeah, it's kind of amazing.

38:56.602 --> 38:58.336
I had no idea
that synesthesia...

38:58.370 --> 39:01.507
-It's amazing, right?
-...would open up an opportunity
for me to create

39:01.540 --> 39:04.175
a world brand-new, and that's
what I want to show everybody.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.711
I mean, for everyone,
for everything...

39:05.744 --> 39:08.213
So, we've been trending
ever since we launched.

39:08.246 --> 39:11.016
LEONARD:
This is very impressive, Cookie.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.151
Okay, look, I know why you
were caught up with Eddie.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.920
You know, he's a charmer,

39:14.953 --> 39:17.423
and he can speechify
with the best of them, but, see,

39:17.456 --> 39:19.558
the core of Empire
comes from the artists.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.560
That's where the soul lies.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.161
And that's what
we're gonna show you tonight.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.330
That's the company I love.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.099
*

39:28.133 --> 39:29.935
MAN:
Oh, snap, look!

39:29.968 --> 39:31.937
(people jeering)

39:31.970 --> 39:33.872
-MAN 2: Blake a Nazi?! For real?
-Look!

39:35.474 --> 39:37.175
-What's that?
-Uh, they must be piggybacking

39:37.208 --> 39:38.577
off the hashtag.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.546
It'll disappear soon.
Don't-don't worry.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.347
(jeering continues)

39:42.380 --> 39:43.715
Did you know about this?

39:43.749 --> 39:45.751
-(jeering continues)
-Is that Blake?

39:45.784 --> 39:47.018
I have no idea, that's who.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.120
Is this some kind of sick joke?

39:49.154 --> 39:50.922
That's the future of Empire?

39:50.956 --> 39:53.391
Wait, wait. No, no.
I have never seen this before

39:53.425 --> 39:55.260
-in my life.
-It's a computer glitch.

39:55.293 --> 39:57.763
-Take that down!
-(booing, jeering)

40:01.900 --> 40:03.602
Yo, listen, man.
Y'all got to listen to me.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.937
That photo
is not what you think.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.372
You telling me

40:07.405 --> 40:09.307
that's not your face
on the screen?

40:09.340 --> 40:11.276
-Nah, man, it is me, but...
-Look, can you just...

40:11.309 --> 40:12.744
-chill.
-Thank you.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.312
-Thank you for hearing me out.
-I don't hear nothin'

40:14.345 --> 40:15.380
but banjo music, colonizer.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.148
I'm just trying to make sure

40:17.182 --> 40:20.218
that you don't make
my A&R nightmare worse.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.054
(sighs)
Listen, man...

40:23.088 --> 40:25.957
my father forced me
to take that photo.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.959
And I hardly ever saw him
in my whole life,

40:27.993 --> 40:29.595
so I just did
what he asked, man.

40:29.628 --> 40:30.929
I was, like, ten years old.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.464
I didn't know what I was doing.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.666
Trust me, bro,
you're like a brother to me.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.234
HAKEEM:
Don't "brother" me!

40:36.267 --> 40:37.569
Get out.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.738
-You serious?
-Get out!

40:39.771 --> 40:41.973
Yeah, you should go.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.109
*

40:44.142 --> 40:46.111
(grunts)

40:46.144 --> 40:48.947
-Look, this is Eddie's doing.
-There's always an excuse.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.949
How could you allow this
to happen?

40:50.982 --> 40:52.684
You assured us
that everything in this event

40:52.718 --> 40:54.986
-would go off without a hitch.
-"Always an excuse"?

40:55.020 --> 40:56.588
Who do you think
you're talking to?

40:56.622 --> 40:58.089
Y'all need to calm down.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.659
You think I meant
for that to happen over there?

41:00.692 --> 41:02.861
Look, Blake is history for now.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.796
I'm gonna talk to him
and work this thing out.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.198
But the rest
of this glorious night can go on

41:07.232 --> 41:08.967
without a hitch.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.102
COOKIE: All we have to do
is get the rest of our artists

41:11.136 --> 41:13.471
to distract the press,
and we can get through

41:13.505 --> 41:16.441
-the rest of this opening.
-You're not gonna use
this artist.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.477
-Excuse me?
-I can't afford to get caught up
in all of this mess.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.613
Word is out
that Empire is making bank

41:21.647 --> 41:23.481
off of a racist artist.

41:23.515 --> 41:25.116
Listen, little lady,

41:25.150 --> 41:27.318
I don't know
what kind of big ideas

41:27.352 --> 41:30.055
Eddie's been filling up
in your little-biddy head,

41:30.088 --> 41:33.491
but ain't nobody here
that's not replaceable.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.861
Well, you can't replace us all,
Lucious.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.963
-(chuckles)
-Your artists are united.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.065
And we're not performing
until y'all fix this.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.633
Can I help?

41:41.667 --> 41:43.301
Help? You did this.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.236
You know, I'm sure you got it
all under control.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.005
Eddie, please don't go.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.140
In my opinion...

41:49.174 --> 41:50.408
We don't want your opinion.

41:50.441 --> 41:52.177
Actually, Cookie, we do.

41:55.413 --> 41:57.515
EDDIE: Everyone. Everyone,
we're about to get started.

41:57.549 --> 41:58.750
WOMAN:
Where's Lucious?

41:58.784 --> 42:00.351
And what is he gonna do
about Blake?

42:00.385 --> 42:02.353
I'm gonna be speaking
for all of Empire.

42:02.387 --> 42:06.558
The views captured in that image
are highly offensive,

42:06.592 --> 42:09.094
in direct opposition to the...

42:09.127 --> 42:11.597
principles of inclusion

42:11.630 --> 42:15.100
and respect
which Empire embraces.

42:15.133 --> 42:17.168
So, effective immediately,

42:17.202 --> 42:19.838
I am banning Blake Sterling

42:19.871 --> 42:23.241
from any association
with Empire Entertainment.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.110
His contract...

42:25.143 --> 42:27.613
is now null and void.

42:27.646 --> 42:29.915
And I'm grateful

42:29.948 --> 42:32.517
to Empire's board

42:32.550 --> 42:34.285
for granting me the...

42:34.319 --> 42:36.287
the... the power

42:36.321 --> 42:38.857
to be able to make sure that...

42:38.890 --> 42:41.326
that this never happens again.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.635
(people gasping)

42:49.668 --> 42:51.937
(grunting)

42:57.008 --> 42:58.677
(whispers):
This is who you are.

42:59.845 --> 43:02.648
This is all you will ever be.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.457
Lucious Lyon, everybody.

43:12.490 --> 43:14.059
(indistinct chatter)

43:14.092 --> 43:15.627
REPORTER: Lucious,
did you approve this?

43:15.661 --> 43:17.262
REPORTER 2: Lucious, is Blake
officially off the roster?

43:17.295 --> 43:19.264
-REPORTER 3: Comment over here!
-Care to comment, sir?

43:19.297 --> 43:20.932
Yo, what's going on at Empire?

43:20.966 --> 43:23.368
(clamoring)

44:02.874 --> 44:04.876
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:07.245 --> 44:09.314
Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:09.347 --> 44:11.850
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.453
You know what time it is?
It's time for the--

44:15.486 --> 44:19.524
ANNOUNCER: Epic return of last
year's sensation, Beat Shazam.

44:19.557 --> 44:20.692
Ding-ding.

Identify hit songs,

44:23.261 --> 44:25.563

44:25.596 --> 44:27.198

-(audience cheering)

44:27.232 --> 44:29.000
and a brand-new DJ.

44:29.034 --> 44:32.337
She's talented.
She's incredible.
She's my daughter Corinne.

44:32.370 --> 44:35.506
Finally, someone
who can keep Jamie in check.

44:35.540 --> 44:37.542
Dad, Dad.

44:37.575 --> 44:39.044
