WEBVTT

00:09.400 --> 00:10.700
- LIFE: IT'S LITERALLY
ALL WE HAVE.

00:10.733 --> 00:12.167
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:12.200 --> 00:13.700
I'M A REVIEWER,
BUT I DON'T REVIEW

00:13.733 --> 00:15.533
FOOD, BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:15.567 --> 00:17.967
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.900
VIVATHE REVOLUTION!

00:19.933 --> 00:21.467
[crowd cheering]

00:21.500 --> 00:23.133
[triumphant music]

00:23.167 --> 00:25.367
AAH!

00:25.400 --> 00:33.133
*

00:33.167 --> 00:35.700
HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO REVIEW.

00:35.733 --> 00:37.233
I'M FORREST MACNEIL.

00:37.267 --> 00:39.833
WHATEVER LIFE EXPERIENCE
YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT,

00:39.867 --> 00:42.967
I WILL DO IT,
AND THEN I WILL REVIEW IT.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.667
AND HERE TO FIELD
YOUR INQUIRIES

00:44.700 --> 00:47.500
FROM THE REVIEW COMMAND CENTER
IS A.J. GIBBS.

00:47.533 --> 00:50.233
A.J., IF WE DO THIS RIGHT,

00:50.267 --> 00:53.400
WE'LL SHED NEW LIGHT
ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE.

00:53.433 --> 00:55.400
- WE'D BETTER DO IT RIGHT.

00:55.433 --> 00:56.667
- YES, WE'D BETTER.

00:56.700 --> 00:59.000
MY FIRST REVIEW.
WHAT IS IT, PLEASE?

00:59.033 --> 01:01.367
- YOUR FIRST REVIEW
COMES TO US FROM MORK

01:01.400 --> 01:02.600
IN LINCOLN, NEBRASKA.

01:02.633 --> 01:04.100
- MORK?
- YEAH.

01:04.133 --> 01:05.367
- WELL, YOU DON'T
HEAR THAT VERY OFTEN.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.967
- NO.
- HI, I'M MARK.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.733
- OH.

01:08.767 --> 01:10.733
- FORREST, I'M THINKING
ABOUT STEALING MY MOM'S TV,

01:10.767 --> 01:12.700
BUT I WONDER WHAT
IT WOULD FEEL LIKE.

01:12.733 --> 01:14.900
WOULD THE GUILT DEVOUR ME
FROM THE INSIDE OUT,

01:14.933 --> 01:17.200
OR WOULD I LIKE IT SO MUCH
THAT I LOSE INTEREST

01:17.233 --> 01:19.800
IN EVERYTHING ELSE IN LIFE?

01:19.833 --> 01:21.567
- STEALING.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.600
WHAT'S IT LIKE TO TAKE THINGS
THAT AREN'T YOURS?

01:27.767 --> 01:29.200
I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

01:29.233 --> 01:32.400
AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW, MARK.
- GOOD LUCK.

01:36.933 --> 01:39.267
- MY OLD FRIEND
MALTED MILK BALLS.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.733
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK,
I COME HERE

01:40.767 --> 01:43.533
AND SCOOP A FEW
OF THESE FELLAS INTO A BAG,

01:43.567 --> 01:44.967
BRING IT UP
TO THE REGISTER,

01:45.067 --> 01:46.600
AND TRADE MY MONEY
FOR MY BALLS.

01:46.633 --> 01:48.533
BUT TODAY--
OH, HELLO.

01:48.567 --> 01:51.733
[chuckles]

01:51.767 --> 01:52.967
TODAY I'M SKIPPING
THAT LAST PART.

01:53.067 --> 01:55.600
COME ON. OKAY.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.800
OH, BOY.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.200
OH, WOW.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.867
WHAT AM I DOING?
WHAT AM I DOING?

02:00.900 --> 02:02.500
WHAT AM I DOING?

02:02.533 --> 02:04.600
DIDN'T REALLY FIND ANYTHING
TO BUY TODAY, SO--

02:04.633 --> 02:05.867
- OKAY.
- JUST ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.133
[thud]
OH, OH.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.467
- YOU ALL RIGHT, DOG?

02:08.500 --> 02:10.167
- I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.467
I'M REALLY DOING THIS.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.700
[deep breath]
OKAY.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.267
THESE PEOPLE TRUST ME.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.833
I CAN GO TO JAIL
FOR THIS.

02:16.867 --> 02:20.067
AAH.

02:20.067 --> 02:21.967
[growls]

02:22.067 --> 02:25.700
OH, WOW.
THAT WAS EXCITING.

02:25.733 --> 02:28.467
I MEAN, IT WAS SCARY,
BUT IT WAS KIND OF SCARY

02:28.500 --> 02:30.333
LIKE A ROLLER COASTER,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

02:30.367 --> 02:32.767
AND I-I CAN'T SAY

02:32.800 --> 02:35.833
I FEEL ANY GUILT
ABOUT IT, REALLY.

02:35.867 --> 02:37.200
AND LOOK AT THESE.

02:37.233 --> 02:38.467
I MEAN, THESE
ARE MY FAVORITES.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.500
[chuckles]

02:40.533 --> 02:44.267
I WONDER IF MY THEFT
WAS TOO IMPERSONAL.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.733
HMM.

02:49.067 --> 02:50.467
HEY, PARDON ME.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.100
CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND
WITH THOSE?

02:52.133 --> 02:53.633
- OH, THANK YOU.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.667
- OH, SURE.
OH, GOOD, YEAH.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.100
- IT'S SO HARD TO GET--

02:57.133 --> 02:59.067
- OH, I KNOW, YES.

02:59.067 --> 03:00.733
WELL, MY PLEASURE.

03:00.767 --> 03:03.600
[clears throat]

03:03.633 --> 03:05.200
SORRY.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.433
OH, YEAH.

03:06.467 --> 03:07.900
- HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

03:07.933 --> 03:09.900
- AH, THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

03:09.933 --> 03:12.700
FEELS BAD.
THAT FEELS REALLY BAD.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.233
BUT STEALING BEGAN TO LOOK
QUITE DIFFERENT TO ME

03:15.267 --> 03:17.067
WHEN I BROUGHT
THE GROCERIES HOME

03:17.100 --> 03:19.567
AND SHARED THEM WITH MY WIFE
SUZANNE AND SON ERIC.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.833
- CAKE!
- OH, MY GOD.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.067
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

03:22.100 --> 03:24.333
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY...LORRAINE"?

03:24.367 --> 03:25.733
- YEAH. WELL, I GUESS

03:25.767 --> 03:27.067
THEY JUST HAD
SOME EXTRA CAKES AND--

03:27.067 --> 03:28.267
- OH. COME HERE, YOU.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.667
both: MWAH.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.233
- VERY GOOD.
- I LOVE THESE SURPRISES.

03:31.267 --> 03:32.900
- YES.

03:32.933 --> 03:34.533
- A LOT OF SHREDDED WHEAT
IN HERE, HUH?

03:34.567 --> 03:36.600
- YEAH.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.367
TO TRULY EXPERIENCE
LIFE AS A THIEF,

03:39.400 --> 03:41.267
I REALIZED I WOULD
HAVE TO PUT MYSELF

03:41.300 --> 03:45.367
AT GREATER AND GREATER RISK
OF LEGAL CONSEQUENCES.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.900
MY CRIMES COULD
NO LONGER BE EASY

03:47.933 --> 03:51.533
OR SIMPLY VICTIMIZE
THE OLD AND THE SLOW.

03:51.567 --> 03:53.100
- EXCUSE ME.
- OH.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.067
- DID YOU JUST TAKE MY HAT?

03:55.067 --> 03:56.333
- NO.

03:56.367 --> 03:57.567
HEY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:57.600 --> 04:00.467
IF SOMEBODY DID
TAKE YOUR HAT,

04:00.500 --> 04:02.500
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO HAVE MINE.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.933
COME ON.

04:03.967 --> 04:05.933
[laughs]
YEAH, WHY NOT?

04:05.967 --> 04:07.300
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND

04:07.333 --> 04:08.800
THAT I WAS
INCREDIBLY TALENTED

04:08.833 --> 04:10.933
AT SEPARATING PEOPLE
FROM THEIR BELONGINGS.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.800
MY GOODNESS.
HEY, IS THAT JUSTIN BIEBER,

04:12.833 --> 04:14.567
OR DOES SHE JUST
LOOK LIKE HIM?

04:14.600 --> 04:15.833
NO, THAT'S HIM.

04:15.867 --> 04:18.067
WHAT AN ANGELIC FACE
HE'S GOT.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.500
THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD NOT HAVE...

04:20.533 --> 04:22.133
FOR FREE.

04:22.167 --> 04:23.800
[siren wails]

04:31.833 --> 04:33.800
[police radio chatter]

04:33.833 --> 04:36.800
[light classical music]

04:36.833 --> 04:40.733
*

04:40.767 --> 04:42.233
- GO!

04:42.267 --> 04:44.233
- INSPIRED BY MY SUCCESSES
WITH PETTY CRIME,

04:44.267 --> 04:46.933
I CONVERTED THE REVIEW OFFICES
INTO A STAGING GROUND

04:46.967 --> 04:48.600
FOR MY MOST AMBITIOUS HEIST YET.

04:48.633 --> 04:49.967
WE ARE NOT HERE
FOR YOUR MONEY.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.267
WE ARE HERE
FOR THE BANK'S MONEY,

04:51.300 --> 04:52.933
WHICH IS FEDERALLY INSURED.

04:52.967 --> 04:55.233
I ENLISTED THE AID OF
MY EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT LUCILLE

04:55.267 --> 04:57.067
AND OUR OFFICE INTERN JOSH.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.467
WE WOULD NOT
GO UNPREPARED.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.133
AS WE SAW DURING
THE FISCAL CRISIS OF 2008,

05:01.167 --> 05:03.167
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
WILL NOT HESITATE

05:03.200 --> 05:05.067
TO STEP IN AND BAIL OUT
THE BANKS...

05:05.100 --> 05:06.500
- 30 SECONDS!
- WITH TAXPAYER MONEY, AND--

05:06.533 --> 05:08.067
WHEN WE DO IT,
I'LL MAKE IT SHORTER.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.633
IT'S TOO LONG. OKAY.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.200
- IF YOU'RE THE HEAD TELLER,
RAISE YOUR HAND!

05:11.233 --> 05:12.733
- WILL YOU PLEASE
BE THE HEAD TELLER, LUCILLE?

05:12.767 --> 05:14.833
PLEASE. GOOD. OKAY.
- GREAT.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.067
OKAY. TAKE ME INTO THE VAULT,
RIGHT NOW!

05:17.067 --> 05:18.633
NO FUNNY BUSINESS.
- GREAT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

05:18.667 --> 05:21.667
WHERE'S THE VAULT?
- OH, IT'S OVER HERE.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.300
- THANK YOU.

05:35.333 --> 05:38.333
- GRACIAS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.300
- GOOD. SO YOU'RE HEADED
TO THE VAULT.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.067
- RIGHT.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.400
- LUCILLE, DO YOU
HAVE THE STOCKINGS?

05:49.433 --> 05:52.333
- YES, I DO.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.367
- OH.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.667
- THERE'S THE GUARD,
MR. MACNEIL.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.100
- OKAY.

06:02.133 --> 06:03.567
LET'S DO THIS.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.700
- THANK YOU.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.267
- MM-HMM.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.767
- THEY CERTAINLY ARE WARM.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.900
- IT'S NICE.

06:10.933 --> 06:12.533
- ALL RIGHT.

06:12.567 --> 06:13.767
HEAD TELLER.
- YEAH.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.367
- STRAIGHT TO THE VAULT, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.733
- AND I'M CROWD CONTROL.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.900
YOU READY?
- YEAH.

06:18.933 --> 06:21.567
- LET'S GO.
- [laughs]

06:25.767 --> 06:27.300
[laughs]

06:27.333 --> 06:30.933
- PLEASE DON'T SKIP.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

06:30.967 --> 06:32.867
LET'S GET IT.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.933
- DROP YOUR WEAPON!
- OH, NO, NO, NO!

06:34.967 --> 06:36.200
[gunshots]

06:36.233 --> 06:38.533
OH, GOD! OH, MY GOD! OH!

06:38.567 --> 06:40.300
[all screaming]
LET'S GO! LET'S GO! GET OUT!

06:40.333 --> 06:41.567
OH, LOOK AT THAT!

06:41.600 --> 06:44.367
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.767
- OH, MY--OH, MAN--

06:45.800 --> 06:47.533
- OH, YOU ARE GONNA DIE.
- NO!

06:47.567 --> 06:49.200
- YES, YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.
- SHUT UP!

06:49.233 --> 06:50.767
- START THE CAR, LUCILLE!

06:50.800 --> 06:52.533
- WHAT?
- THERE WAS ANOTHER GUARD!

06:52.567 --> 06:54.600
START THE CAR!
START THE CAR!

06:54.633 --> 06:56.767
OPEN THE DOORS!
- HOLD ON.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.300
- REACH THROUGH
AND OPEN THE HANDLE.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.800
MANUALLY OPEN IT.
- THERE!

06:59.833 --> 07:02.133
- THANK YOU.
WHY WAS THAT SO HARD?

07:02.167 --> 07:03.633
COME ON, JOSH!

07:03.667 --> 07:05.467
- HE'S BLEEDING.
- YES, I KNOW HE'S--

07:05.500 --> 07:06.767
- [screams]
- GO, GO, GO!

07:06.800 --> 07:08.500
DRIVE, DRIVE, DRIVE!
- AAH!

07:08.533 --> 07:10.467
- OH, WHAT A POINTLESS
WAY TO DIE!

07:10.500 --> 07:12.433
- YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT I'M DYING!

07:12.467 --> 07:13.933
- YOU DON'T SEE THE BLOOD!

07:13.967 --> 07:15.533
THIS IS A LOT OF BLOOD!
- I'M GONNA BE FINE!

07:15.567 --> 07:16.800
- IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT US

07:16.833 --> 07:18.067
TO SAY TO YOUR FAMILY?

07:18.067 --> 07:19.767
- [bleep] YOU!
I TRUSTED YOU.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.300
- OH, DON'T SAY THAT--

07:21.333 --> 07:22.700
ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT
LEAVE THE BANK

07:22.733 --> 07:25.067
WITH A GARBAGE BAG
FULL OF CASH,

07:25.067 --> 07:27.967
I TOOK AWAY SOMETHING
FAR MORE VALUABLE:

07:28.067 --> 07:31.167
A NEWFOUND RESPECT
FOR AMERICA'S UNPAID INTERNS.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.133
JOSH'S SCREAMS
WILL HAUNT ME FOREVER.

07:33.167 --> 07:35.467
- AAH! OH, GOD!

07:35.500 --> 07:38.433
- MY ONLY CONSOLATION,
IF THERE EVEN IS A CONSOLATION,

07:38.467 --> 07:40.200
IS THAT HE WILL NOW
CARRY AROUND WITH HIM,

07:40.233 --> 07:41.667
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,

07:41.700 --> 07:44.933
A REMINDER ABOUT THE FOLLIES
OF STEALING...

07:44.967 --> 07:47.700
ON HIS BUTTOCKS.
THAT'S WHERE THE REMINDER IS.

07:47.733 --> 07:50.733
STEALING: TWO STARS.

07:58.667 --> 08:01.900
- LET'S SEE WHAT
MY NEXT REVIEW IS, A.J.

08:01.933 --> 08:05.767
- PATTY IN
PARK CITY, UTAH, TEXTS:

08:15.500 --> 08:17.433
- WELL, THE ONLY THING
I'VE EVER BEEN ADDICTED TO

08:17.467 --> 08:19.867
IS A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.300
I GUESS THAT
DOESN'T COUNT, THOUGH.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.200
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

08:23.233 --> 08:25.700
I AM ABOUT TO GO
AND GET MYSELF ADDICTED

08:25.733 --> 08:27.567
TO SOMETHING STRONGER

08:27.600 --> 08:30.433
AND MORE POWERFUL
THAN KNOWLEDGE.

08:30.467 --> 08:31.700
AHA.

08:31.733 --> 08:35.600
THOSE ARE NICELY MADE LINES.

08:35.633 --> 08:37.133
WELL, I HAVE NEVER
DONE COCAINE BEFORE,

08:37.167 --> 08:38.867
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW EASY OR HARD IT IS

08:38.900 --> 08:40.400
TO GET ADDICTED TO IT.

08:40.433 --> 08:43.967
I CONFESS I AM QUITE NERVOUS
ABOUT THIS, BUT--

08:44.067 --> 08:47.367
THANK YOU.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.133
BON VOYAGE.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.433
- HAPPY SAILING.

08:50.467 --> 08:51.933
- [snorts]

08:51.967 --> 08:53.400
[grunts]

08:53.433 --> 08:55.467
AAH. OH!

08:55.500 --> 08:57.433
THAT'S LIKE BLEACH
IN MY SINUSES.

08:57.467 --> 08:58.700
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

08:58.733 --> 09:01.633
[coughs, hacks]

09:01.667 --> 09:04.333
NO. THAT'S A TERRIBLE FEELING.

09:04.367 --> 09:05.600
GOOD-BYE, COCAINE.

09:05.633 --> 09:07.367
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
MISTER--

09:07.400 --> 09:09.700
AAH.
- WHAT?

09:09.733 --> 09:11.500
YOU WOULD'VE LIKED
TO HAVE DONE THAT COCAINE?

09:11.533 --> 09:13.100
- NO.
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.700
THAT'S ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

09:15.733 --> 09:17.767
I FEEL LIKE GOING FOR A WALK.
YOU WANNA GO FOR A WALK?

09:17.800 --> 09:19.333
- YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE OUT YOUR TRASH REAL QUICK.

09:19.367 --> 09:20.833
- THAT'S FINE.

09:20.867 --> 09:22.933
SOME PEOPLE SIMPLY
CAN'T GET ADDICTED.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.933
THEIR BRAINS ARE TOO STURDY.

09:24.967 --> 09:26.433
COULD THIS BE MY PROBLEM?

09:26.467 --> 09:28.800
I TESTED THAT HYPOTHESIS
WITH TWO OTHER

09:28.833 --> 09:30.867
FAMOUSLY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES:

09:30.900 --> 09:32.533
CIGARETTES FILLED
WITH TOBACCO...

09:32.567 --> 09:34.333
[coughing]

09:34.367 --> 09:35.600
OH, NO, NO, NO.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.133
AND ALCOHOLIC WINE.

09:37.167 --> 09:40.267
BUT I COULD NOT GET
THOSE MONKEYS ON MY BACK.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.200
ALL THIS DOES
IS MAKE ME SLEEPY.

09:43.233 --> 09:46.300
I THINK I'LL, UH,
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.067
[exhales]

09:50.067 --> 09:52.200
SO YOU CAN ADD ALCOHOL
TO THE LIST

09:52.233 --> 09:53.867
OF [bleep]
I'M NOT ADDICTED TO.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.800
I MEAN, MAYBE I'M JUST
INVULNERABLE TO ADDICTION.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.633
LIKE, WHAT AM I,
A SUPERHERO?

09:57.667 --> 09:59.300
IT'S MR. INVULNERABLE!

09:59.333 --> 10:00.833
[laughs]

10:00.867 --> 10:02.433
OKAY, SO I HAVE TRIED

10:02.467 --> 10:04.100
COCAINE, CIGARETTES, ALCOHOL.

10:04.133 --> 10:05.600
DIDN'T GET ADDICTED
TO ANY OF THOSE.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.267
BUT THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I NEED TO TRY.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.600
COCAINE!
[chuckles]

10:09.633 --> 10:12.500
JUST LIKE MY WIFE SUZANNE,
WHO FOR YEARS

10:12.533 --> 10:15.700
HAD ENJOYED TAKING POT
FROM TIME TO TIME,

10:15.733 --> 10:17.667
MY OCCASIONAL RECREATIONAL USE
OF COCAINE

10:17.700 --> 10:19.500
HAD IMPROVED MY LIFE.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.200
I WAS MORE PRODUCTIVE...

10:21.233 --> 10:22.833
RED ONES AND YELLOW ONES.
I GOT A LOT OF RED BOOKS--

10:22.867 --> 10:24.100
I MADE MORE SCARVES...

10:24.133 --> 10:26.100
I'M MAKING YOU ONE.

10:26.133 --> 10:27.300
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL WEAR IT
OR NOT--I DON'T EVEN CARE.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.600
I WAS A BETTER FATHER.

10:28.633 --> 10:29.867
CHICKEN LITTLE GOES UP
TO HENNY PENNY.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.500
"HENNY PENNY,
THE SKY IS FALLING!"

10:31.533 --> 10:32.867
AND OF COURSE HENNY PENNY
DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.267
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THE SKY IS FALLING?"

10:34.300 --> 10:35.767
THE SKY IS FALLING!

10:35.800 --> 10:37.500
[snores]

10:37.533 --> 10:39.633
[sniffs]
OKAY.

10:39.667 --> 10:40.867
ALL RIGHT.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.267
- HEY, FORREST.
- [grunts]

10:42.300 --> 10:43.700
- DID YOU MAKE
14 ATM WITHDRAW--

10:43.733 --> 10:45.167
WHOA.
- YEAH, SORRY.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.700
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
- NOTHING, IT BROKE.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.967
IT JUST BROKE.
IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.333
NO. WHAT? WHAT?
- OKAY.

10:49.367 --> 10:51.533
SOMEBODY MADE 14 ATM WITHDRAWALS
THIS WEEK.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.800
- WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME
THAT IT WOULD BE ME?

10:52.833 --> 10:54.033
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER MAYBE

10:54.067 --> 10:55.467
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME IS DOING IT?

10:55.500 --> 10:56.700
IT COULD BE
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.

10:56.733 --> 10:57.967
- WHO'S WHAT'S-HIS-NAME?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.600
- YOU KNOW, UPSTAIRS.

10:59.633 --> 11:01.500
THE KID.
[clears throat]

11:01.533 --> 11:02.833
ALL RIGHT, HOT SHOT,
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

11:02.867 --> 11:04.600
- ERIC?

11:04.633 --> 11:06.700
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YES, YOU WIN THAT ONE.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.067
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

11:08.067 --> 11:09.333
- NOTHING'S WRONG.
I'M FINE.

11:09.367 --> 11:12.500
I'M JUST TRYING
TO EAT SOMETHING.

11:12.533 --> 11:13.833
- [sighs]

11:13.867 --> 11:15.433
- SHOW ME WHAT I DID WRONG.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.400
- I'M PRETTY SURE
THESE GRAY ONES GO IN HERE.

11:17.433 --> 11:18.733
- I VOLUNTEERED
TO CHAPERONE ERIC

11:18.767 --> 11:20.667
AND HIS FRIENDS
ON A CAMPING TRIP

11:20.700 --> 11:22.167
AND MADE
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

11:22.200 --> 11:25.267
ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP
TO COCAINE.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.233
WAIT A MINUTE.
HEY, ERIC.

11:27.267 --> 11:30.500
HAVE YOU SEEN, UH,
THAT BAG THAT I HAD,

11:30.533 --> 11:34.667
THAT LITTLE PLASTIC BAG
OF, UH, CAMPING POWDER?

11:34.700 --> 11:36.167
- NO.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.267
- BEING SEPARATED
FROM COCAINE FOR SIX HOURS

11:38.300 --> 11:40.367
MADE ME REALIZE
I HAD A PROBLEM,

11:40.400 --> 11:41.600
AND I NEEDED HELP...

11:41.633 --> 11:43.367
IN THE FORM
OF MORE COCAINE.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.067
- HEY, MR. MACNEIL.
- DO YOU HAVE IT?

11:45.100 --> 11:47.067
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.833
GOD.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.367
ALL RIGHT, MEN, WE'RE GONNA DO
EVERYTHING THIS WEEKEND.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.767
WE'RE GONNA GET OUR
BIRD-WATCHING BADGES.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.400
WHO WANTS THEIR BIRD-WATCH--
ANYBODY WANT

11:53.433 --> 11:55.367
THEIR BIRD-WATCHING BADGE,
WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.233
WE'RE GONNA FIND SOME BIRDS,
AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH THEM,

11:57.267 --> 11:58.733
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET OUR
ORIENTEERING BADGES, YOU GUYS.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.800
- YOUR NOSE IS BLEEDING.
- OH.

12:00.833 --> 12:02.400
THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M HAVING
A HEART ATTACK, YOU GUYS.

12:02.433 --> 12:03.900
- DAD?
- I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

12:03.933 --> 12:05.500
- DO YOU HAVE SHOOTING PAIN
DOWN YOUR ARM?

12:05.533 --> 12:06.967
- YEAH, I GOT SHOOTING PAINS
EVERYWHERE.

12:07.067 --> 12:08.233
OH, MY GOD,
I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

12:08.267 --> 12:09.633
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA DIE.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.400
I AM DEFINITELY GONNA DIE!

12:11.433 --> 12:12.633
OH, GOD! OH!
- DAD?

12:12.667 --> 12:13.900
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

12:13.933 --> 12:15.333
SHUT UP.
HOW DO YOU KNOW CPR?

12:15.367 --> 12:17.067
WHY DO YOU KNOW CPR?
THIS KID'S A COP!

12:17.100 --> 12:18.767
- DAD?
- THIS KID IS A COP!

12:18.800 --> 12:20.567
[birds chirping]

12:20.600 --> 12:22.267
- WE DON'T KNOW
HOW HE'LL REACT,

12:22.300 --> 12:24.967
BUT REMEMBER, YOU LITERALLY
COULD BE SAVING HIS LIFE.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.600
SO IT'S IMPORTANT
EVERYONE IS HERE AND--

12:26.633 --> 12:27.833
- OH, MY--OKAY.
- OH, WHAT IS THIS?

12:27.867 --> 12:29.500
OH, IS THIS AN INTERVENTION?

12:29.533 --> 12:32.333
ALWAYS A FAST LEARNER,
I WAS PROUD TO SEE

12:32.367 --> 12:34.500
I HAD GONE FROM FUMBLED SNORTING
TO OVERDOSE

12:34.533 --> 12:36.800
TO FAMILY INTERVENTION
IN RECORD TIME.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.167
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
PUT YOUR LETTERS AWAY.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.433
I CAN SAVE YOU SOME TIME.
NO, NO, NO.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.800
I'VE BEEN A MONSTER, RIGHT?

12:40.833 --> 12:42.400
EVERYBODY'S GONNA SAY THAT,
RIGHT?

12:42.433 --> 12:43.933
I'VE BEEN A REAL TERRIBLE DAD.
I LET YOU DOWN.

12:43.967 --> 12:45.767
I'VE BEEN A HORRIBLE
SON-IN-LAW.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.167
I'VE BEEN A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT
AS A DOG OWNER.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.400
I'VE BEEN SUCH A BAD NEIGHBOR.

12:50.433 --> 12:51.800
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I DID
TO THESE GUYS.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.733
WHO CARES?
LET'S GO TO REHAB!

12:53.767 --> 12:55.067
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO
TO REHAB!

12:55.067 --> 12:56.567
COME ON, TOM, HURRY UP!

12:56.600 --> 12:57.900
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.900
LET'S JUST GO!
LET'S JUST GO!

13:00.067 --> 13:03.867
- I-I GUESS I SHOULD GO TOO.
- OKAY.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.300
- SORRY.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.200
- WELL, I'M GONNA READ
MY SPEECH.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.067
I WORKED HARD ON IT.

13:11.067 --> 13:13.833
"IN THE WORDS
OF GRANDMASTER FLASH,

13:13.867 --> 13:16.233
"YOU GOING HIGH
ON THAT COCAINE.

13:16.267 --> 13:19.700
YOU GOING CRAZY
LIKE A COCAINE TRAIN."

13:19.733 --> 13:21.167
- WHEN I GET BACK FROM REHAB,

13:21.200 --> 13:22.867
I'LL PROBABLY SAY COCAINE
IS TERRIBLE,

13:22.900 --> 13:25.700
BUT DON'T BELIEVE ME.
COCAINE IS AMAZING!

13:25.733 --> 13:28.167
I GIVE IT A MILLION STARS!

13:28.200 --> 13:30.300
DO NOT BELIEVE THE GUY
IN THE STUDIO

13:30.333 --> 13:32.200
WHO TRIES TO TELL YOU
IT'S TERRIBLE.

13:32.233 --> 13:35.233
- [sobbing]
- THAT GUY IS A LIAR!

13:37.900 --> 13:39.967
NO. I AM NOT A LIAR.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.233
HE IS.

13:41.267 --> 13:42.533
I AM A RECOVERING ADDICT

13:42.567 --> 13:43.967
WHO WENT TO REHAB
AND GOT CLEAN.

13:44.067 --> 13:46.867
HE IS A DRUG-ADDLED MANIAC

13:46.900 --> 13:49.133
WHO NEARLY DESTROYED HIS FAMILY
AND HIS FINANCIAL SECURITY

13:49.167 --> 13:50.867
AND HIS HEART AND HIS BRAIN.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.900
ADDICTION:
HALF A STAR.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.667
- A.J., MAY I HAVE
MY NEXT REVIEW, PLEASE?

14:07.700 --> 14:09.700
- @KELLYóOFóVT TWEETS:

14:16.100 --> 14:17.500
- GOING TO THE SENIOR PROM.

14:17.533 --> 14:19.667
IT WON'T BE EASY
FOR AN ADULT LIKE ME,

14:19.700 --> 14:22.767
BUT I WILL FIND A WAY
TO DO IT.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.767
PROM SEASON
WAS IN FULL SWING,

14:24.800 --> 14:26.733
BUT TO GAIN ENTRY
TO THIS EXCLUSIVE EVENT,

14:26.767 --> 14:29.367
I'D NEED
AN AGE-APPROPRIATE ESCORT.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.500
I DON'T HAVE A DATE MYSELF.

14:31.533 --> 14:33.167
NO DATE TO THE PROM.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.333
BUT JUST LIKE
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

14:35.367 --> 14:38.100
EVERY TEENAGE GIRL I ASKED
ALREADY HAD PLANS.

14:38.133 --> 14:40.433
THAT'S QUITE HURTFUL,
BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.733
EXCUSE ME, I DON'T HAVE
A VISITOR'S PASS,

14:42.767 --> 14:44.767
SO I NEED TO MAKE THIS
REALLY QUICK.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.200
HEY, I'M LOOKING FOR A DATE
TO YOUR SENIOR PROM,

14:46.233 --> 14:47.533
AND I DON'T CARE
WHO I GO WITH.

14:47.567 --> 14:49.167
HANG ON, NOW.
ALL RIGHT.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.700
OOP, THERE'S THAT
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

14:50.733 --> 14:52.100
WHO WAS GIVING ME GRIEF
BEFORE.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.267
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE BUILDING.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.833
EVENTUALLY, MY SEARCH
FOR A HUMAN PROM TICKET

14:58.867 --> 15:01.267
LED ME TO MY OWN LIVING ROOM.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.300
I SEE YOU FOUND
THE SANDWICHES.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.933
MEG CARMICHAEL, A SENIOR
AT NEARBY FRANKLIN HIGH,

15:06.967 --> 15:09.400
WAS OUR SITTER.

15:09.433 --> 15:12.400
[classical music playing]

15:12.433 --> 15:14.167
*

15:14.200 --> 15:16.400
[music stops]

15:16.433 --> 15:19.767
MEG, THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.800
YOU'RE A SENIOR
IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW, YES?

15:22.833 --> 15:24.400
- Y-YEAH.

15:24.433 --> 15:27.433
- AND YOU'VE GOT A PROM
COMING UP, RIGHT?

15:27.467 --> 15:29.067
- YEAH.

15:29.067 --> 15:32.067
- HAS ANYONE ASKED YOU
TO YOUR SENIOR PROM YET?

15:35.133 --> 15:36.667
- NO.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.800
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO YOUR PROM WITH ME?

15:45.333 --> 15:47.567
- OKAY.
- YES!

15:47.600 --> 15:49.967
OH, GOODY!
I'M--I'M GLAD. I'M GLAD.

15:50.067 --> 15:54.067
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A VERY GOOD TIME.

15:54.067 --> 15:56.833
NOW I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.933
I ARRIVED AT 6:00 SHARP

15:58.967 --> 16:01.867
TO FIND MY DATE LOOKING
ELEGANT AND LADYLIKE.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.633
[chuckles]
LOOK AT THAT DRESS.

16:03.667 --> 16:07.200
OH, MY GOODNESS, IT MATCHES
YOUR WHOLE PERSONALITY.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.533
AFTER A BRIEF PHOTO SHOOT
ON THE FRONT LAWN...

16:09.567 --> 16:10.967
THIS IS SORT OF AN EXCITING
MILESTONE

16:11.067 --> 16:12.467
FOR PARENTS, ISN'T IT?

16:12.500 --> 16:15.233
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S IN STORE
FOR US TONIGHT?

16:15.267 --> 16:16.533
- WE WERE ON OUR WAY.

16:16.567 --> 16:19.533
[dance music]

16:19.567 --> 16:20.967
*

16:21.067 --> 16:22.467
WHOO!

16:22.500 --> 16:25.733
PAGING MEG CARMICHAEL
TO THE DANCE FLOOR!

16:25.767 --> 16:27.667
*

16:27.700 --> 16:29.300
MEG WAS A SWEET ENOUGH GIRL,

16:29.333 --> 16:31.833
BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED
THE RESULTS OF MY EXPERIMENT

16:31.867 --> 16:34.900
WERE BEING SKEWED BY HER
SEEMINGLY GENETIC INABILITY

16:34.933 --> 16:36.167
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.467
HUH?
- I'M NOT DANCING.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.967
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA DANCE?
COME ON.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.333
PUT THAT DOWN.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.633
THERE'S BETTER FOOD
THAN THAT HERE.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.900
DID YOU BRING THIS FROM HOME?

16:42.933 --> 16:44.233
YOU BROUGHT
YOUR OWN SANDWICH?

16:44.267 --> 16:45.867
LET'S GO HAVE US SOME PROM.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.200
HEY, HOW'S EVERYBODY OVER HERE?
HOW'S IT GOING?

16:48.233 --> 16:50.200
MEG AND I WERE JUST CIRCULATING
ABOUT, MEETING SOME FOLK.

16:50.233 --> 16:51.533
ARE YOU A FRIEND OF MEG'S?

16:51.567 --> 16:53.367
- UM...
- OH, NO.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.200
LOOK AT THAT REACTION.
THAT'S INTERESTING.

16:55.233 --> 16:57.333
HAVE WE SIDLED
UP TO A TABLE FULL

16:57.367 --> 16:58.733
OF POPULAR KIDS?

16:58.767 --> 17:01.100

17:11.100 --> 17:12.733
69 IS MY FAVORITE TEMPERATURE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.233
- YES, IT IS. 69.
IT'S LIKE A PERFECT SPRING DAY.

17:15.267 --> 17:16.700
- NO, MR. MACNEIL IT IS NOT--

17:16.733 --> 17:18.133
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.867
I LIKE 69.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.567
- IT'S OUR ONE AND ONLY
PROM NIGHT.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.533
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND IF WE GET

17:35.567 --> 17:36.967
[romantic music]

17:37.067 --> 17:38.767
ALTHOUGH DEPRESSED MYSELF
AT THIS POINT,

17:38.800 --> 17:40.933
I DECIDED TO RALLY MEG
WITH A PEP TALK.

17:40.967 --> 17:42.800
ONE DAY, EVERYONE HERE

17:42.833 --> 17:44.900
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MEAN,
THEY WILL REGRET

17:44.933 --> 17:46.200
HOW INSENSITIVE THEY WERE.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.633

17:47.667 --> 17:49.067

THE SAME QUESTION.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.600
- I'M THE WRESTLING COACH HERE.

18:04.633 --> 18:06.200

18:06.233 --> 18:07.667

JUST SAME AS EVERYBODY,
I GUESS.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.067
THIS IS A GREAT PROM.

18:11.067 --> 18:12.700
THIS IS A PROM.
- YEAH.

18:12.733 --> 18:13.967
- IT'S NOT LIKE OUR PROM,
YOU KNOW.

18:14.067 --> 18:15.800
WE HAD THIS HORRIBLE PROM

18:15.833 --> 18:17.667
IN THIS ABANDONED
FISH FACTORY, AND, YOU KNOW,

18:17.700 --> 18:20.367
NOBODY--I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF YOU WERE THERE FOR THAT.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.633
- I WASN'T, BECAUSE WE SENT YOU
TO DECOY PROM.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.067
[laughs]
YES.

18:25.067 --> 18:26.433
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

18:26.467 --> 18:28.333
WE HAD A SEPARATE PROM
FOR THE NERDS,

18:28.367 --> 18:30.100
AND HE FELL FOR IT.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.600
- OH, THAT WAS A S--
OH, OKAY.

18:31.633 --> 18:33.100

18:33.133 --> 18:34.833
- YEAH, AND DID YOU HAVE
ANY OF THE PUNCH THERE?

18:34.867 --> 18:36.133

18:37.833 --> 18:39.700

18:39.733 --> 18:41.100
[laughing]

18:41.133 --> 18:42.633
- THAT IS ELABORATE.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.633
- DECOY PROM.
- OH, MAN.

18:44.667 --> 18:45.867
SOMETHING ELSE.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.667
- YEAH.
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:47.700 --> 18:50.167
UH, I FORGIVE YOU,

18:50.200 --> 18:52.267
AND I THINK
WE SHOULD HUG ON IT.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.100
- OH. ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.300
- WE'RE GONNA HUG IT OUT.
- YEAH, YEAH, I THINK SO.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.167
I THINK, AFTER ALL THIS TIME,
WHY NOT?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.200
- WELL, IT WAS REALLY GREAT
TO RUN INTO YOU.

19:00.233 --> 19:01.433
- FANTASTIC.
- ENJOY A REAL PROM.

19:01.467 --> 19:02.833

[both chuckling]

19:04.233 --> 19:06.400
INCREDIBLE. OKAY.

19:06.433 --> 19:09.067
THIS PROM IS ABOUT TO GET FUN.
COME WITH ME.

19:09.067 --> 19:11.067
LET'S GO.

19:11.100 --> 19:14.067
PERHAPS I HAD ALSO GONE
TO DECOY REHAB,

19:14.067 --> 19:16.100
BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE
TO WITHSTAND THE PRESSURES

19:16.133 --> 19:17.833
OF THIS PROM.

19:17.867 --> 19:20.367
I'M NOT PROUD THAT I STOLE
TODD SCHUSTER'S WALLET,

19:20.400 --> 19:21.867
AND I'M NOT PROUD THAT I SPENT

19:21.900 --> 19:24.300
HIS WRESTLING COACH MONEY
ON COCAINE.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.600
- WHEN YOU GO TO A PROM,

19:29.633 --> 19:31.867
YOU WEAR A COSTUME AND PRETEND
TO BE ALL GROWN UP.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.700
LET'S BLOW.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.067
MEN'S ROOM, RIGHT NOW,
ALL OF YOU.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.400
COME ON, LET'S GO.

19:36.433 --> 19:38.400
BUT IT WAS CLEAR TO ME
THAT DEEP DOWN,

19:38.433 --> 19:40.833
NONE OF US WERE READY
FOR THE ADULT WORLD AT ALL.

19:40.867 --> 19:42.833
[sniffs]
AH, YEAH!

19:42.867 --> 19:44.867

IMMEDIATELY, IT'S LIKE, BANG!
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, MEG.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.567

19:48.600 --> 19:50.900
- MEG. MEG.
- I-I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.367
all: MEG, MEG, MEG, MEG.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.700
- NO.
all: MEG!

19:53.733 --> 19:55.067
PEER PRESSURE, PEER PRESSURE,

19:55.100 --> 19:56.400
PEER PRESSURE, PEER PRESSURE,

19:56.433 --> 19:57.667
PEER PRESSURE, PEER--

19:57.700 --> 19:59.167

19:59.200 --> 20:02.433
[cheers, claps]
IT WORKS!

20:02.467 --> 20:05.433
[energetic dance music]

20:13.467 --> 20:15.833
MEG, MEG, MEG, MEG, MEG!

20:15.867 --> 20:17.333
[cheering]

20:17.367 --> 20:18.667
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

20:18.700 --> 20:20.567
DID YOU SEE THAT?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.100
- THIS IS ME!

20:22.133 --> 20:23.867
THIS IS WHO I REALLY AM!

20:23.900 --> 20:25.833
THIS IS WHO I AM!

20:25.867 --> 20:27.500
- WHOO!

20:27.533 --> 20:31.333
[all cheering, shouting]

20:31.367 --> 20:33.067
[police radio chatter]

20:33.100 --> 20:35.533
OH, GOD, I'M GONNA DIE!

20:35.567 --> 20:37.400
- NO!
- I'M GONNA DIE HERE!

20:37.433 --> 20:39.767
[sobbing]

20:39.800 --> 20:43.100
LEAVE ME ALONE!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

20:43.133 --> 20:46.767
YOU GUYS ARE RUINING
THE PROM!

20:46.800 --> 20:49.033
MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO GO TO THE PROM

20:49.067 --> 20:50.667
WITH A DATE
WHO'S NOT A SOCIAL OUTCAST

20:50.700 --> 20:52.700
WITH AN UNDIAGNOSED
MOOD DISORDER,

20:52.733 --> 20:55.400
AND YOU WILL HAVE THE NIGHT
OF YOUR LIFE.

20:55.433 --> 20:58.033
BUT FEW PEOPLE
ARE EVER THAT LUCKY,

20:58.067 --> 21:00.267
AND IT IS NOT WORTH
THE RISK.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.100
GOING TO THE PROM:
HALF A STAR.

21:11.633 --> 21:14.400
- [crying]

21:14.433 --> 21:16.067
[mutters]

21:16.067 --> 21:18.500
[sobs]

21:18.533 --> 21:20.533
- BACK TO REHAB.
