01:22.782 --> 01:27.458
There is one kidnapping every 60 minutes
in Latin America.

01:27.542 --> 01:31.455
70°%° of the victims do not survive.

02:20.382 --> 02:21.258
?Si? ?Bueno?

02:21.342 --> 02:24.971
Family is everything, no?

02:25.062 --> 02:28.213
Now, do you love your son?

02:29.622 --> 02:31.101
Si.

02:39.302 --> 02:42.772
Now, do you understand?

02:43.822 --> 02:48.054
You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.

02:48.582 --> 02:49.981
Follow these instructions

02:50.222 --> 02:52.611
or God be with your child.

02:53.102 --> 02:54.421
You will remove your shirt

02:54.502 --> 02:56.538
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

02:57.462 --> 02:59.373
Be professional.

03:00.422 --> 03:01.298
Come alone.

03:10.542 --> 03:13.181
!Porfavor!!Ayùdenme!

03:20.702 --> 03:23.375
!Ayùdenme, porfavor!

03:52.662 --> 03:55.654
EL PASO, TEXAS
US / MEXICO BORDER

04:52.262 --> 04:57.541
Georgina! Obey me.
I will love you. Come on.

04:58.222 --> 05:00.690
- That's how it works, huh?
- That's right.

05:08.302 --> 05:10.657
She got a sister?

05:11.542 --> 05:13.533
How's business?

05:14.742 --> 05:17.575
The Japanese are here in a big way.

05:18.582 --> 05:25.260
Cheap labour, factory space, but they feel
a lot safer living over the border in El Paso.

05:25.342 --> 05:30.211
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

05:34.462 --> 05:37.613
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

05:41.022 --> 05:44.173
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

05:44.262 --> 05:48.733
No. I've been movin' around. You know.
Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.

05:48.822 --> 05:51.973
Nothin' catches my fancy.

05:54.982 --> 05:58.338
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

05:58.422 --> 06:00.538
- No.
- You don't?

06:00.622 --> 06:01.896
Me either.

06:04.062 --> 06:08.817
- How long you stayin'?
- I don't know, I just... you know.

06:08.902 --> 06:12.736
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

06:12.822 --> 06:15.290
I just came by on impulse.

06:15.382 --> 06:17.816
I could do with some impulse.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.253
What happened?

06:31.382 --> 06:37.537
Family paid the ransom, then they
sent the kid home after a couple of days.

06:37.622 --> 06:39.692
Minus an ear, of course.

06:39.782 --> 06:43.331
Now every mother in Mexico City
with money wants bigger bodyguards.

06:43.422 --> 06:47.540
- My own wife included.
- I hate to break it to you, but she's right.

06:47.622 --> 06:49.931
She's right.

06:50.022 --> 06:54.254
Look, Sammy, all my clients
have kidnap and ransom insurance.

06:54.342 --> 06:57.459
I have a policy.
AIG. My dad gave it to me.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.295
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.

07:00.382 --> 07:04.853
But what'll you do in 60 days when you can't
renew it because you have no bodyguard?

07:04.942 --> 07:07.695
I know. I had to let Emilio go.

07:07.782 --> 07:12.697
Well, you gotta please Lisa.
I mean, ass like that's hard to find.

07:13.702 --> 07:15.693
Look.

07:15.782 --> 07:20.902
A bodyguard's like anything else.
You get what you pay for, OK?

07:20.982 --> 07:23.815
You could do this.
Get one that's got a decent résumé.

07:23.902 --> 07:27.861
We're not lookin' for goddamn Superman,
right? Get someone cheap.

07:27.942 --> 07:34.290
So you renew the policy, and then
fire the prick for whatever - incompetence.

07:34.382 --> 07:38.853
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school,

07:38.942 --> 07:41.775
and that your wife gets to save face.

07:41.862 --> 07:48.097
This way you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighbourhood.

07:57.942 --> 08:01.935
That's right, a bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.

08:02.022 --> 08:04.980
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

08:05.062 --> 08:06.973
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.

08:07.062 --> 08:10.896
It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show. Nothing's gonna happen.

08:10.982 --> 08:15.294
Yeah? You think they'd
hire a drunk, a has-been?

08:16.622 --> 08:18.772
You have to keep it under control.

08:20.102 --> 08:24.732
What ifthere was, you know... just, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

08:24.822 --> 08:29.498
You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.

08:29.582 --> 08:33.813
It's not exactly a scam, Crease.
Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.

08:33.902 --> 08:37.496
Yeah. A bodyguard's gotta
be close to people, though.

08:37.582 --> 08:40.494
They talk all the time.
You know I'm no good at that.

08:40.582 --> 08:44.461
You'll be the silent type.
They're gonna appreciate that.

08:51.702 --> 08:53.897
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

08:53.982 --> 08:56.655
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

08:56.742 --> 09:00.860
- He owns one ofthe plants in Juàrez.
- Yeah?

09:00.942 --> 09:03.297
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

09:03.382 --> 09:06.658
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

09:06.742 --> 09:10.417
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

09:10.502 --> 09:14.290
He asked me if I knew anybody he could trust.

09:14.382 --> 09:17.260
- And you thought of me?
- Yeah.

09:17.342 --> 09:20.732
Take ajob, Crease. Breathe some air.

09:20.822 --> 09:22.972
Then decide ifyou want to stick around.

09:23.062 --> 09:27.180
Besides, I'm glad to see you, you know?
I got nobody to talk to down here.

09:34.462 --> 09:39.252
Listen, my wife wants
someone presentable and polite.

09:39.342 --> 09:42.732
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

09:42.822 --> 09:44.494
Your résumé's quite impressive.

09:44.582 --> 09:48.939
16 years of military experience,
extensive counter-terrorism work.

09:49.022 --> 09:52.298
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

09:52.382 --> 09:54.498
I drink.

09:54.582 --> 09:56.573
How does that affect you?

09:59.062 --> 10:01.098
Coordination, reaction time.

10:01.182 --> 10:04.572
Iftop professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can,

10:04.662 --> 10:07.051
but the service will be on a par with the pay.

10:08.982 --> 10:10.893
What if amateurs try it?

10:10.982 --> 10:14.179
I'd probably kill 'em. Is that likely?

10:14.262 --> 10:16.059
No.

10:16.142 --> 10:21.170
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

10:45.462 --> 10:47.453
Lisa!

10:49.382 --> 10:51.373
Lisa!

11:02.822 --> 11:05.859
My wife Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

11:11.582 --> 11:13.777
- You're an American.
- So are you.

11:15.102 --> 11:16.501
It's all in there.

11:21.262 --> 11:24.937
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes. Jack and water would be good.

11:26.222 --> 11:28.577
Have you done much of
this kind ofwork before?

11:28.662 --> 11:29.777
No, ma'am.

11:29.862 --> 11:33.537
But he has a lot of experience
in related fields.

11:35.822 --> 11:38.541
- Do you have a family, Mr Creasy?
- No.

11:39.062 --> 11:41.451
Pita? Pita.

11:45.102 --> 11:47.935
- Yes, Mom?
- Honey, this is Mr Creasy.

11:50.022 --> 11:52.775
Buenas tardes, señor Creasy.
Mucho gusto en conocerle.

11:52.862 --> 11:57.652
It's English, honey. Do you wanna
show Mr Creasy to his room?

11:57.742 --> 12:00.097
- This way, Mr Creasy.
- OK.

12:09.422 --> 12:11.538
Thank you.

12:18.142 --> 12:19.461
Just like that?

12:20.862 --> 12:25.697
I think it's nice that he's an American.

12:25.782 --> 12:29.855
I think it's terrific. Are you sure?

12:32.382 --> 12:34.179
Thank you.

12:34.502 --> 12:36.060
Thank you.

12:37.062 --> 12:39.053
I feel better now.

12:41.502 --> 12:44.096
- !Hola, Bruno!
- Buenas tardes.

12:44.182 --> 12:48.653
That's Bruno, the gardener.
And that's Maria, the cook.

12:48.742 --> 12:51.495
- !Hola, Maria!
- Hola, Pita.

12:53.622 --> 12:57.535
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

13:00.462 --> 13:04.250
You've got a TV and a CD player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr Creasy?

13:04.342 --> 13:07.857
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

13:07.942 --> 13:10.695
I don't know.

13:10.782 --> 13:15.173
That's Bird. Emilio forgot
to take him when he left.

13:16.182 --> 13:18.457
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

13:20.342 --> 13:24.415
Have you protected
a lot of children before, Mr Creasy?

13:24.502 --> 13:28.097
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.934
Creasy.

13:30.022 --> 13:32.217
Bye, Creasy.

13:34.662 --> 13:36.459
Bye, Bird.

13:45.782 --> 13:50.617
- School tomorrow, Peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

13:50.702 --> 13:53.057
Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.

13:53.142 --> 13:55.212
Yeah, we'll see.

13:55.302 --> 14:00.092
Ifyou get a dog, will you give up your bear?
You're getting too old for him.

14:02.822 --> 14:08.340
- How did you like Mr Creasy?
- Creasy. He said to call him just Creasy.

14:08.422 --> 14:12.301
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?
- No, not if he asked you.

14:12.382 --> 14:15.180
Here. There you go.

14:22.742 --> 14:24.698
He's like a bear, too.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.658
- Yeah?
- A big, sad bear.

14:29.942 --> 14:33.696
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

14:37.982 --> 14:39.973
Good night, honey.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.496
Can you get me some floss in the morning?

14:44.582 --> 14:46.459
- Floss?
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.

14:46.542 --> 14:48.294
Sure.

14:51.222 --> 14:53.213
Good night, Bear.

14:54.222 --> 14:56.213
Creasy Bear.

15:28.182 --> 15:32.494
- What's that one for?
- La Virgen de Guadalupe.

15:32.582 --> 15:36.257
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

15:36.342 --> 15:41.621
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one. I don't know.

15:43.822 --> 15:45.813
She likes him.

15:46.742 --> 15:49.654
- What are you talkin' about?
- Creasy.

15:51.102 --> 15:53.093
Pita likes him.

15:54.542 --> 16:00.651
Pita loves school. Pita would love Count
Dracula if he took her back there, honey.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.539
OK?

16:04.342 --> 16:06.936
Hey. Are you OK?

16:07.022 --> 16:09.377
- I don't know.
- OK?

16:11.622 --> 16:15.137
I don't know, Lisa. I'm trying.

17:09.142 --> 17:10.939
Come on, Bird.

17:11.021 --> 17:13.855
That's right, that's right. Come on.

17:13.942 --> 17:15.614
All right.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.532
Home to Emilio.

17:18.462 --> 17:20.373
You're home free, baby.

17:39.622 --> 17:42.295
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The US.

17:42.382 --> 17:45.215
- I know, but which state?
- No state in particular.

17:45.302 --> 17:52.652
- You can drive and talk at the same time.
- No, I can't, Pita, so please let me do myjob.

17:52.742 --> 17:54.380
Are you going to stay?

17:55.742 --> 18:00.372
My last bodyguard left. Somebody
gave him more money than we could.

18:00.462 --> 18:04.250
I guess that makes me a bargain, then, huh?

18:04.342 --> 18:09.291
Being black. Is that a positive or a negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?

18:09.382 --> 18:11.498
Time will tell.

18:13.942 --> 18:17.901
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City
in the last six days.

18:17.982 --> 18:20.450
- Four a day.
- Yeah? 24?

18:20.542 --> 18:24.171
- 24. What do you think about that?
- I think you know more than you should.

18:24.262 --> 18:26.014
Well, thank you.

18:53.102 --> 18:55.821
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

18:55.902 --> 18:59.133
- What?
- You have to sign in. Show them your ID.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.213
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

19:01.302 --> 19:02.576
Come on.

19:03.782 --> 19:05.454
Right there.

19:05.542 --> 19:08.136
- Hola, Manuel.
- Hola, Pita.

19:17.742 --> 19:20.302
- !Hola, Pita!
- !Hola!

19:20.742 --> 19:24.018
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

19:24.102 --> 19:27.299
Sister Anna,
this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.

19:27.382 --> 19:31.295
- Sister Anna, the headmistress.
- Señor Creasy.

19:32.502 --> 19:36.700
- Hurry. Class is about to begin. Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

19:36.782 --> 19:37.851
Madre.

19:37.942 --> 19:41.378
You must look after our Pita.
It is not good that she is late today.

19:41.462 --> 19:45.740
I'm very sorry. I have to get used to
the routes. It won't happen again.

19:45.822 --> 19:49.417
No offence, but I regret that
your profession needs to exist.

19:49.502 --> 19:52.460
So do I, Madre, so do I.

19:52.542 --> 19:56.137
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

19:57.742 --> 19:59.733
No, not for a long time.

19:59.822 --> 20:02.575
The Bible says, "Be not overcome of evil..."

20:02.662 --> 20:06.701
"But overcome evil with good."

20:06.782 --> 20:09.535
That's Romans Chapter 12 Verse 21.

20:12.382 --> 20:15.294
I am the sheep that got lost, Madre.

21:16.062 --> 21:20.260
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

21:20.342 --> 21:22.617
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

21:22.702 --> 21:26.456
No, I don't remember.
No, I didn't like it.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.737
Why not?

21:28.822 --> 21:33.134
Because it wasn't a school like yours, Pita.
There was no Sister Anna.

21:35.702 --> 21:37.977
Were you unhappy?

21:40.022 --> 21:43.332
Being unhappy, that's a state of mind.
I really don't remember.

21:52.342 --> 21:54.617
What happened to your hand?

21:55.942 --> 21:57.660
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

21:57.742 --> 21:59.175
Look, no more questions, OK?

22:01.942 --> 22:05.651
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question to me.

22:06.902 --> 22:09.052
No, gracias. Gracias, no, no.

22:09.142 --> 22:11.417
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you.

22:11.502 --> 22:12.491
No, no, no.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.972
I'm being paid to be your bodyguard.
Look at me.

22:16.502 --> 22:22.577
I'm not being paid to be your friend, but
to protect you. So no more questions, period.

22:24.462 --> 22:25.975
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

22:28.662 --> 22:31.176
- No crying.
- I'm not crying.

22:32.182 --> 22:34.218
Well, don't start.

22:34.302 --> 22:37.658
You gotta understand, this is ajob.
In order for me to do myjob...

22:40.222 --> 22:42.417
Wait a minute.

23:28.742 --> 23:30.733
Yeah, come in.

23:36.102 --> 23:38.093
Mr Creasy.

23:38.782 --> 23:41.615
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

23:41.702 --> 23:43.101
I'm fine, thanks.

23:44.662 --> 23:48.974
Is the food all right?
Because Maria told me you didn't eat.

23:50.502 --> 23:55.053
Yeah, the food is great.
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

23:57.422 --> 23:59.982
So you read the Bible?

24:00.782 --> 24:03.421
Yeah, sometimes.

24:03.502 --> 24:05.538
Does it help?

24:05.622 --> 24:07.260
Yeah, sometimes.

24:09.422 --> 24:12.494
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

24:14.422 --> 24:17.255
How are you doing with Pita?

24:17.342 --> 24:18.855
Fine.

24:18.942 --> 24:22.332
As soon as she figures out that
I'm not her new toy, it'll be fine.

24:22.422 --> 24:24.811
- She told me about that.
- OK.

24:26.302 --> 24:29.533
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

24:29.622 --> 24:32.455
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

24:32.542 --> 24:35.056
And Pitajust wants to be friends.

24:35.142 --> 24:36.734
OK.

24:36.822 --> 24:42.101
But you're paying me to protect her,
not to be her friend, right?

24:43.542 --> 24:45.533
So...

24:46.782 --> 24:49.171
Look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.

24:49.262 --> 24:54.256
Maybe your husband should find
somebody that's a little more sociable.

24:56.542 --> 24:57.861
No, you're right.

25:00.302 --> 25:02.941
You're being paid to protect her.

25:03.022 --> 25:06.412
And I'm confident that you'll do that.

25:10.702 --> 25:15.492
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

25:43.382 --> 25:46.499
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

26:11.102 --> 26:14.890
I'm tired of killin', Ray.
I'm tired of killin', Ray.

26:17.742 --> 26:22.020
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

26:22.102 --> 26:24.218
In my state, I couldn't...

26:24.302 --> 26:26.338
I couldn't guard a corpse.

26:26.422 --> 26:28.333
They talk all the time.

26:28.422 --> 26:31.141
You know I'm no good at that.

26:31.502 --> 26:34.221
You know I'm no good at that.

26:35.382 --> 26:37.134
You know how they say...

26:38.862 --> 26:41.740
a bullet always tells the truth?

27:21.262 --> 27:22.980
Yeah?

27:23.062 --> 27:25.212
- Hey.
- Crease.

27:25.302 --> 27:26.894
What's wrong?

27:26.982 --> 27:32.818
Hey, listen, you ever have
a 9mm round that didn't go off?

27:32.902 --> 27:35.416
Yeah. Failure to fire.

27:35.502 --> 27:38.539
I know, failure to fire and...

27:38.622 --> 27:43.457
You know, I pulled the trigger
and click - nothing.

27:43.542 --> 27:47.820
- You're talkin' about a bad primer.
- Yeah, yeah, but I...

27:47.902 --> 27:52.453
Yeah, right. Dimple on the primer.
That may be...

27:52.542 --> 27:54.817
Well, like we used to say...

27:56.102 --> 27:58.775
a bullet always tells the truth.

28:05.582 --> 28:08.335
Crease? You all right?

28:08.422 --> 28:10.094
Yeah.

28:11.102 --> 28:13.411
What were you shootin' at?

28:13.502 --> 28:15.697
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray. I'm sorry I woke you.

28:15.782 --> 28:19.661
No, it's OK, it's nothin'. I was watchin' TV.

28:21.462 --> 28:23.453
OK.

29:39.822 --> 29:42.336
Pita, you have a pencil?

29:46.622 --> 29:48.214
Thank you.

30:20.542 --> 30:25.252
- It's hard to get used to the traffic down here.
- Yeah. I'm very sorry.

30:45.062 --> 30:47.098
- See you, baby.
- See you later.

30:47.182 --> 30:51.334
- Hey, don't forget your towel.
- Thank you.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.419
Bye.

32:01.382 --> 32:04.215
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

32:09.902 --> 32:11.699
Thanks.

32:14.862 --> 32:17.456
So, what do I do?

32:17.542 --> 32:20.898
You're the fastest in the water,
the slowest offthe blocks.

32:20.982 --> 32:23.257
What do you think that means?
What you gotta do?

32:23.342 --> 32:26.334
- Get faster offthe blocks?
- Get faster offthe blocks.

32:27.302 --> 32:29.611
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

32:29.702 --> 32:35.220
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- You'll be fine. You'll be OK.

32:36.862 --> 32:39.137
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

32:39.222 --> 32:44.216
- I never finish better than third.
- Then maybe you are slow.

32:46.782 --> 32:49.933
With us this evening we have
Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper

32:50.022 --> 32:52.297
to speak with us about the kidnappings.

32:53.382 --> 32:56.499
Who are the ones responsible
for the kidnappings in Mexico?

32:56.582 --> 33:00.177
It is an activity of organised crime.
It's not a random kidnapping.

33:00.262 --> 33:02.378
They are not political kidnappings
like in Colombia.

33:02.462 --> 33:04.612
!Vamos, Bird!

33:04.702 --> 33:06.693
!Vamos!

33:12.182 --> 33:14.776
How do you think he got out?

33:16.342 --> 33:17.661
I let him go.

33:17.742 --> 33:21.257
- It's better to be free, right?
- It's better for him.

33:22.902 --> 33:25.735
Actually, he was driving me crazy.

33:29.182 --> 33:31.013
Good night.

33:35.942 --> 33:37.694
Good night.

33:52.302 --> 33:55.100
- See you in a couple of days, OK? I love you.
- Love you.

33:55.182 --> 33:56.979
Be good. Come on, Lise.

33:57.062 --> 34:00.418
All right, sweetheart,
so we'll call you from Detroit, OK?

34:01.222 --> 34:03.292
- I love you.
- Love you.

34:03.382 --> 34:05.418
- OK, bye.
- Señora, su café.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.413
Gracias.

34:07.502 --> 34:11.699
- OK, bye, honey. I love you!
- Love you.

34:16.542 --> 34:18.293
I hate leaving her.

34:31.302 --> 34:33.452
Concentrating?

34:33.542 --> 34:35.533
Eyes are closed?

34:39.621 --> 34:41.340
- What happened?
- I flinched.

34:41.422 --> 34:43.731
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

34:43.822 --> 34:47.098
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- The gunshot holds no fear! Say it!

34:47.181 --> 34:48.820
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

34:48.902 --> 34:51.052
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

34:51.141 --> 34:54.612
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good. You welcome the sound.

34:54.702 --> 34:56.737
In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.

34:56.822 --> 35:01.020
You are a prisoner on this block until
that sound sets you free. Are you ready?

35:01.102 --> 35:03.696
- Yes.
- Are you ready? Are you set?

35:11.422 --> 35:13.413
Creasy?

35:13.502 --> 35:15.732
What's a concubine?

35:15.822 --> 35:18.973
- Why do you ask?
- It's in my history book.

35:19.982 --> 35:23.611
- It's like a wife, right?
- Yeah, yeah, it's...

35:23.702 --> 35:25.977
Can I see that? It's kind of a wife.

35:26.062 --> 35:27.381
Right there.

35:27.462 --> 35:30.613
But the Emperor of China had 1,000 ofthem.

35:32.342 --> 35:36.130
OK, like nowadays, in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

35:36.222 --> 35:42.695
But in the olden-time cultures they had,
you know, different... different rules.

35:44.422 --> 35:46.413
Why? You feel sorry for the husband?

35:46.502 --> 35:50.575
Yeah. Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

35:52.022 --> 35:54.377
Creasy.

35:54.462 --> 35:56.976
- You're smiling.
- What?

35:57.062 --> 35:59.212
- You were smiling.
- No, I'm not.

35:59.302 --> 36:00.496
- You were.
- No, I was not.

36:00.582 --> 36:03.221
- You're not now, but you were.
- Youwere smiling. I wasn't.

36:03.302 --> 36:04.655
- You were.
- When?

36:04.742 --> 36:07.176
- Five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

36:07.262 --> 36:11.778
- Well, a second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

36:11.862 --> 36:13.978
- Ten seconds ago.
- Ten seconds ago I was smiling.

36:14.062 --> 36:17.975
OK, in the next ten seconds,
we'll see who smiles first.

36:21.302 --> 36:23.691
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- You.

36:23.782 --> 36:26.171
No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.

36:26.262 --> 36:31.734
That's not a smile. A smirk is different. They
both start with S, but they're not the same...

36:31.822 --> 36:34.495
- Do your homework.
- You were.

36:37.422 --> 36:39.219
Bang!

36:40.142 --> 36:42.702
Stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

36:42.782 --> 36:44.010
Bang!

36:45.582 --> 36:47.413
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

36:47.502 --> 36:50.778
Come here. Hurry up, hurry up.

36:50.862 --> 36:52.454
Set.

36:52.542 --> 36:54.931
Bang! Bang!

36:57.982 --> 37:02.180
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

37:02.262 --> 37:07.256
Listen for the sound. You don't anticipate.
Concentrate on the sound. Understand me?

37:07.342 --> 37:09.333
They're gaining on you. Go, go, go, go!

37:09.422 --> 37:13.620
Stop, stop! Come on, get out. Let's go again.

37:28.702 --> 37:32.092
?Yqué? ?Todo bien?
Las maletas, porfavor.

37:32.182 --> 37:33.615
- Daddy!
- Come here, girl.

37:35.062 --> 37:38.054
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

37:38.142 --> 37:41.214
I got a surprise for you. Are you ready?

37:41.742 --> 37:43.733
You got me a dog! You got me a dog!

37:44.382 --> 37:47.180
- You bought me a dog! Oh, my gosh!
- What do you think?

37:47.262 --> 37:50.618
Oh, my gosh.
Just what I wanted. What's his name?

37:50.702 --> 37:53.580
- Sam. Like Dad.
- Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam!

37:55.142 --> 37:57.133
State...

37:59.502 --> 38:02.255
Bhutan. It's a Himalayan kingdom.

38:02.342 --> 38:05.778
They were having some problems
with the royal family not long ago.

38:05.862 --> 38:07.500
OK.

38:09.302 --> 38:11.657
Any more questions?

38:11.742 --> 38:16.816
- Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
- What? No. What kind of question is that?

38:16.902 --> 38:20.053
- You're supposed to be studying history.
- It's Creasy history.

38:20.142 --> 38:22.940
- No, ancient history.
- Who was your very first girlfriend?

38:23.022 --> 38:24.091
- Nonya.
- Nonya?

38:24.182 --> 38:27.492
Nonya business, that's who. OK?

38:28.182 --> 38:30.059
Hi.

38:30.142 --> 38:33.691
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

38:33.782 --> 38:35.773
Yes, ma'am.

38:35.862 --> 38:38.740
All right. Well, I'll...

38:38.822 --> 38:41.416
I'll leave you to your history.

38:41.502 --> 38:44.300
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

38:46.542 --> 38:49.010
- OK, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

38:55.142 --> 38:58.100
Go, Pita! Go, go, go, go, go!

38:58.182 --> 39:00.093
!Ràpido!!Ràpido!

39:00.182 --> 39:02.571
Go, go, go, go, go!

39:02.662 --> 39:04.937
!Bravo, Pita!

39:06.142 --> 39:08.292
- 10.99.
- Yes!

39:11.462 --> 39:13.930
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

39:14.022 --> 39:17.253
There's trained and there's untrained.
Now, which are you?

39:17.342 --> 39:20.652
- Trained.
- Trained. OK, we'll go again.

39:28.662 --> 39:30.653
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

39:30.742 --> 39:32.300
OK. Hey.

39:32.382 --> 39:35.454
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

39:35.542 --> 39:39.296
That's right. Don't smile, don't fool around
ifyou wanna win. Trained or untrained?

39:39.382 --> 39:40.974
- Trained.
- Go.

39:41.982 --> 39:46.498
- Señor Creasy, nice to see you.
- Good to see you, Madre.

39:46.582 --> 39:49.142
Pita's parents are away on business in Juàrez.

39:49.222 --> 39:51.782
Today, you are her father.

41:11.142 --> 41:13.610
!Yla ganadora es Pita Ramos!

41:19.062 --> 41:22.099
I won, Creasy! I won!

41:22.182 --> 41:24.571
- OK.
- I won!

41:34.462 --> 41:38.774
- Once upon a time, when we were young...
- When lwas young.

41:38.862 --> 41:41.740
Well, when we were young
and he was younger,

41:41.822 --> 41:44.575
and all heads turned our way,

41:44.662 --> 41:47.176
we made a deal to take the world together.

41:47.262 --> 41:51.050
Yeah, then one day I got a call,
and you said...

41:51.142 --> 41:54.418
"I'm in love, I'm in love!"

41:54.502 --> 41:56.857
"And I'm movin' to Mexico!"

41:56.942 --> 41:59.376
And I said, "Huh?"

41:59.462 --> 42:02.852
I said, "What happened to the plan?
What happened to it?"

42:02.942 --> 42:07.572
- I said, "The plan's right here!"
- Yeah, yeah. And what'd I do?

42:07.662 --> 42:09.892
I hung up. And then I met Alicia.

42:09.982 --> 42:14.100
And then I went, "Now I got ya. I got ya."

42:14.182 --> 42:16.855
I got it. Can I kiss her?

42:16.942 --> 42:18.853
Absolutely.

42:18.942 --> 42:21.581
Hey, what are you doin'?

42:25.862 --> 42:30.378
- You got me.
- OK, I think now's as good a time as any.

42:33.102 --> 42:35.741
I bought it with my own money.

42:37.582 --> 42:39.573
Thank you.

42:41.102 --> 42:43.093
Open it.

42:47.262 --> 42:51.653
It's Saint Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.

42:55.302 --> 42:57.213
Well deserved.

43:01.102 --> 43:03.775
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

43:05.182 --> 43:07.173
You're welcome.

43:54.502 --> 43:56.458
- Dad?
- Yes, sweetie?

43:56.542 --> 43:59.010
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes.

44:00.582 --> 44:03.494
I don't wanna play piano, I wanna swim.

44:03.582 --> 44:07.734
It's not open for discussion, honey, OK?
Mr Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher.

44:07.822 --> 44:11.974
If he accepts you as a student,
you're gonna play the piano. Sorry.

44:12.062 --> 44:13.939
- Whatever.
- Baby.

44:16.382 --> 44:18.896
- I love you.
- Love you.

44:18.982 --> 44:22.099
- I just want what's best for you, you know?
- OK.

44:22.182 --> 44:24.332
OK, honey.

44:34.102 --> 44:36.775
Ifyou broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together,

44:36.862 --> 44:39.615
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

44:39.702 --> 44:41.897
Sam, get back.

44:41.982 --> 44:44.860
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

44:44.942 --> 44:46.933
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.496
Remember the day you wanted the pencil?

44:52.582 --> 44:55.619
- Yeah.
- I know why.

44:55.702 --> 44:57.181
Yeah?

44:57.262 --> 45:01.733
You wanted the licence number off ofthat car.
I wrote it down in my notebook.

45:01.822 --> 45:04.382
I got it all but the last number.

45:04.462 --> 45:07.579
I'll get it from you later. Can you belch?

45:07.662 --> 45:09.812
Like burp. Can you burp?

45:13.902 --> 45:18.339
- That's good. That's very good.
- I just had a Coke.

45:18.422 --> 45:20.697
Listen to me. This famous teacher...

45:20.782 --> 45:24.695
He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays
for the symphonies and all that, right?

45:24.782 --> 45:27.342
Belch every few minutes
while you're practising.

45:27.422 --> 45:32.052
You apologise to him, but you keep belching.
You'll offend every sensibility he has.

45:32.142 --> 45:35.691
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

45:35.782 --> 45:37.773
Right, Sam?

45:42.942 --> 45:46.537
- Hola.
- Lupita Ramos.

45:49.582 --> 45:51.652
For you, Creasy.

45:54.782 --> 45:56.579
Thank you.

45:59.742 --> 46:02.939
- How does this look?
- Good. Good.

46:05.342 --> 46:07.014
- Hola, Pita.
- Hola.

46:07.502 --> 46:08.139
Come on in.

46:08.222 --> 46:09.211
Bye.

46:09.302 --> 46:11.293
- How long?
- One hour.

46:11.382 --> 46:13.179
Gracias.

46:39.942 --> 46:41.534
Pita...

46:49.662 --> 46:52.734
!Pita! Porfavor, concéntrate.

48:11.782 --> 48:12.817
Pita!

48:15.462 --> 48:16.292
Pita!

48:23.262 --> 48:24.934
No te vas a callar.

48:25.982 --> 48:27.938
Pita!

48:36.542 --> 48:38.134
Run!

49:53.622 --> 49:55.977
Creasy!

49:56.062 --> 49:57.973
Creasy!

50:00.022 --> 50:02.172
Creasy. Creasy!

50:03.022 --> 50:05.058
Creasy!

50:16.942 --> 50:18.421
I can't...

50:40.582 --> 50:45.098
John W Creasy is under arrest for the murder
oftwo officers ofthe Judicial Police.

50:45.182 --> 50:47.776
Creasy!

50:56.022 --> 50:59.537
This man, John W Creasy,

50:59.622 --> 51:01.180
an American citizen,

51:01.262 --> 51:02.980
is under arrest for the murder

51:03.222 --> 51:05.577
oftwo officers ofthe Judicial Police

51:08.142 --> 51:10.702
and is suspected of possible involvement

51:10.782 --> 51:13.421
in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.

51:15.502 --> 51:18.062
Chief Ramirez...

51:20.142 --> 51:22.576
The two officers who were killed.

51:22.662 --> 51:24.937
Records show they were off duty at the time.

51:25.622 --> 51:28.011
So why were they in uniform

51:28.302 --> 51:29.212
and in a patrol car?

51:29.302 --> 51:32.897
All I know is that they died bravely.

51:33.822 --> 51:35.016
Of course,

51:35.102 --> 51:37.696
but what exactly were they doing

51:37.782 --> 51:39.135
at the scene ofthe kidnapping?

51:39.822 --> 51:42.814
Or were they known
for their exceptional good luck?

51:42.902 --> 51:44.813
They were known for being corrupt

51:44.902 --> 51:47.257
and now are celebrated for being dead.

52:41.902 --> 52:44.257
Excuse me.

52:49.742 --> 52:51.812
Relax, OK? Relax, Sammy.

52:57.062 --> 53:00.418
I know she's your little girl. When I
tell you everything's gonna be all right,

53:00.502 --> 53:03.062
everything's gonna be all right.

53:04.662 --> 53:06.937
Señor Ramos.

53:14.622 --> 53:17.090
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

53:17.182 --> 53:20.811
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division,
Policia Judicial.

53:20.902 --> 53:24.372
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus.
I'm the family attorney.

53:24.462 --> 53:29.616
Speak slower, please.
My Russian is better than my English.

53:29.702 --> 53:34.332
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and we
neither need nor want any police assistance.

53:34.422 --> 53:37.971
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

53:38.702 --> 53:44.937
Señor Ramos, two police officers were killed
during your daughter's abduction.

53:45.022 --> 53:47.820
I have a written order from...

53:47.982 --> 53:49.859
the Public Minister...

53:50.102 --> 53:52.013
authorising our participation...

53:52.102 --> 53:54.616
..."unofficially".

53:55.622 --> 54:00.218
Ifyou want to speak to
Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

54:02.262 --> 54:03.900
OK.

54:03.982 --> 54:08.214
The kidnapper will tell you
to deliver the money alone.

54:08.902 --> 54:10.779
Porfavor, don't do that.

54:10.862 --> 54:16.334
Or you will find yourself in a real
Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila...

54:16.422 --> 54:18.413
and no Pita.

54:56.022 --> 54:57.011
Crease?

54:59.022 --> 55:00.011
Crease.

55:02.782 --> 55:06.377
When I heard it was this hospital,
I was so pleased.

55:06.462 --> 55:09.898
There is a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's.

55:09.982 --> 55:14.021
They have the best pastries in Mexico.

55:14.102 --> 55:17.890
Miguel Manzano. Director ofthe AFl.

55:17.982 --> 55:23.852
And a former director of Interpol, in Rome.

55:24.942 --> 55:28.173
- And you are?
- A friend of his. Rayburn.

55:28.262 --> 55:30.014
Rayburn.

55:43.302 --> 55:44.735
?Hola?

55:44.862 --> 55:47.456
Do you love your daughter, señor Ramos?

55:47.542 --> 55:49.578
Yes. Yes.

55:49.662 --> 55:52.734
- Do you want to see her again?
- Yes, I do.

55:52.822 --> 55:54.096
Señor...

55:55.062 --> 55:59.772
Ifyour daughter's life is
as important to you as it is to me,

55:59.862 --> 56:02.092
you will do as I say.

56:02.182 --> 56:04.138
Yes?

56:04.222 --> 56:05.701
OK, yes.

56:06.342 --> 56:08.378
Crease. You hear me?

56:11.742 --> 56:13.892
You got four of 'em, all dead.

56:15.622 --> 56:18.580
- Pita?
- It's...

56:20.382 --> 56:22.896
It's been two days.

56:22.982 --> 56:25.701
They're negotiating a ransom.

56:27.102 --> 56:30.572
These things take time, Mr Creasy.

56:34.982 --> 56:36.540
Crease.

56:38.662 --> 56:41.460
Don't fuck with me, all right?

56:46.782 --> 56:50.058
You have the ten million?
Do you have the money?

56:50.142 --> 56:53.771
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now, ifyou do as I say,

56:53.862 --> 56:58.060
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

56:58.142 --> 57:02.101
But ifyou deviate
from the process in any way...

57:02.662 --> 57:04.573
By the Virgin of Guadeloupe,

57:04.662 --> 57:07.051
I swear you will never see her again.

57:07.142 --> 57:10.134
I understand. Listen, I too
worship la Virgen de Guadalupe...

57:10.222 --> 57:12.178
I ask ifyou understand.

57:14.902 --> 57:18.019
Hello, sir. This is Mr Ramos's attorney.

57:18.102 --> 57:20.935
He's going through a very difficult time,
but he understands.

57:21.022 --> 57:24.253
Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.

57:24.342 --> 57:29.291
OK, the money, ten million US, will be divided
into two 15-gallon black canvas bags,

57:29.382 --> 57:33.534
each containing five million, which
will be checked at the bank by the KR agent,

57:33.622 --> 57:38.059
then driven to the house in an armoured car,
where it will be transferred to the delivery car.

57:38.862 --> 57:41.535
You got a flat tyre here.

57:41.622 --> 57:43.613
This is for you.

57:44.662 --> 57:46.937
Hello. Yeah.

57:47.022 --> 57:49.490
Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.

57:49.582 --> 57:51.732
No. Why?

57:51.822 --> 57:55.497
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

57:55.582 --> 57:58.654
Look, he's a nervous kid.
He doesn't respond well to stress.

58:00.702 --> 58:05.173
All right, but the car will not be powerful.

58:05.262 --> 58:10.131
Remove the trunk lid.
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

58:10.862 --> 58:14.537
You will arrive at La Diana fountain at 1am.

58:14.622 --> 58:18.615
You will drive around the circle two times.

58:18.702 --> 58:23.412
Samuel will remove his shirt
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

58:23.502 --> 58:26.335
to ID the car.

58:27.382 --> 58:30.977
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.

58:31.062 --> 58:36.659
The phone will ring.
You will answer and wait for instructions.

58:36.742 --> 58:41.452
There is a map on the top
ofthe phone. Follow it.

58:43.382 --> 58:45.213
Perfecto.

58:45.302 --> 58:47.691
Tranquilo. Si.

58:49.062 --> 58:51.940
- What are you doing? He said no phones.
- Relax, relax.

58:52.022 --> 58:55.697
I'm just trying to protect your daughter, OK?

59:00.422 --> 59:01.537
What's goin' on?

59:01.862 --> 59:04.581
Hospitals can be very dangerous places,

59:04.662 --> 59:08.450
especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

59:20.342 --> 59:24.130
Leave the money in the trunk ofthe white car

59:24.222 --> 59:26.213
and return to your car.

59:27.942 --> 59:31.139
Do not look back.

59:39.622 --> 59:41.214
What's going on, guys?

59:41.302 --> 59:42.815
Ambush!

59:48.662 --> 59:52.337
Remember... I'm a professional.

59:52.622 --> 59:59.937
If you keep your word, I will keep mine.

01:00:08.902 --> 01:00:10.972
- Hello?
- Mr Ramos.

01:00:11.062 --> 01:00:14.452
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.

01:00:15.062 --> 01:00:16.620
You took my money.

01:00:16.702 --> 01:00:18.613
Señor Ramos...

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:21.535
God be with your child.

01:00:23.382 --> 01:00:28.058
All right. Get outta here, all ofyou.
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:00:28.142 --> 01:00:30.337
OK, this is Lisa...

01:00:31.182 --> 01:00:33.855
Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.

01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:39.978
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

01:00:40.062 --> 01:00:43.020
Please don't harm my daughter.

01:00:44.662 --> 01:00:47.415
This conversation is not being recorded.

01:00:47.502 --> 01:00:49.777
You're negotiating directly with me.

01:00:49.862 --> 01:00:55.255
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, señora.

01:00:55.342 --> 01:00:57.936
I'm really sorry.

01:00:58.622 --> 01:01:00.613
Now it is too late.

01:01:09.942 --> 01:01:14.333
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house! Now!

01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:17.981
Get out! Get out!

01:02:04.385 --> 01:02:07.218
Hey, Ray. How are you...?

01:02:09.465 --> 01:02:13.094
- Where am l?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

01:02:17.265 --> 01:02:20.655
Manzano was afraid
the cops were gonna kill ya.

01:02:21.665 --> 01:02:23.656
How you doin', doc?

01:02:28.505 --> 01:02:30.496
What's the matter?

01:02:33.585 --> 01:02:35.780
She's dead, Crease.

01:02:38.025 --> 01:02:42.541
It's a mess. Somebody
hijacked the drop and...

01:02:46.225 --> 01:02:50.537
The kidnapper's nephew was killed,
so he killed Pita.

01:03:02.465 --> 01:03:05.935
He has gunshot wounds
to the chest and the abdomen.

01:03:06.305 --> 01:03:08.216
He has a collapsed lung
which we've re-inflated.

01:03:08.305 --> 01:03:12.344
He's lucky to be alive.
If he doesn't rest, he will die.

01:03:14.985 --> 01:03:16.498
How long will he be hospitalised?

01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:18.416
Approximately a month.

01:03:20.825 --> 01:03:22.656
No.

01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:31.982
No.

01:03:36.825 --> 01:03:39.897
Did you recognise any ofthese men?

01:03:41.065 --> 01:03:45.422
No. Does that make me a suspect?

01:03:46.145 --> 01:03:48.022
No.

01:03:48.105 --> 01:03:50.096
It would be convenient, but no.

01:03:51.345 --> 01:03:55.258
Maybe you should show me pictures of some
Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere.

01:03:55.345 --> 01:03:57.654
Those were all policemen.

01:03:57.745 --> 01:04:00.703
Bad Judicial cops,

01:04:00.785 --> 01:04:04.937
protected, by a brotherhood.

01:04:05.025 --> 01:04:06.856
A brotherhood?

01:04:08.385 --> 01:04:11.980
A brotherhood, called...

01:04:27.305 --> 01:04:29.819
You all set?

01:04:29.905 --> 01:04:31.497
- Right arm.
- Yeah.

01:04:34.465 --> 01:04:36.854
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:04:36.945 --> 01:04:38.981
Let's go.

01:05:14.145 --> 01:05:16.215
- Somebody's on us.
- Yeah.

01:05:17.145 --> 01:05:18.737
Lois Lane.

01:05:19.465 --> 01:05:22.582
Mariana something, works for Reforma.

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:25.779
Newspaperjournalist.

01:05:25.865 --> 01:05:28.982
I guess she thinks you're a scoop.

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:32.183
I'll get you up to the border.

01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:35.575
A friend will take you to San Diego,
drop you at the Naval Hospital.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:37.974
I'm not goin', Ray.

01:05:38.065 --> 01:05:40.454
What are you gonna do?

01:05:40.545 --> 01:05:44.060
Let's take a ride by the crime scene.
She can follow us.

01:05:52.825 --> 01:05:54.816
Buenos dias.

01:06:52.345 --> 01:06:54.575
Mr Creasy?

01:06:54.665 --> 01:06:57.304
A lot of people are looking for you.

01:06:58.345 --> 01:07:00.813
I'm Mariana Garcia Guerrero.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:03.980
Reporter, for Reforma.

01:07:06.545 --> 01:07:08.820
Nice to meet you.

01:07:08.905 --> 01:07:10.782
I found this across the street.

01:07:14.305 --> 01:07:15.863
Open it.

01:07:19.385 --> 01:07:21.979
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

01:07:25.785 --> 01:07:29.175
- They've put a curse on you.
- A little late.

01:07:33.025 --> 01:07:37.177
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.

01:07:40.225 --> 01:07:42.500
I can help you.

01:07:44.305 --> 01:07:48.344
There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.

01:07:48.425 --> 01:07:52.134
It protects government officials,
corrupt police and organised crime

01:07:52.225 --> 01:07:56.537
at a level that is too difficult for me to reach.

01:07:56.625 --> 01:07:58.104
OK.

01:07:58.185 --> 01:08:03.657
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos
are victims ofthis organisation.

01:08:03.745 --> 01:08:10.014
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give me
your story, and then I can help you. Please.

01:08:14.385 --> 01:08:16.580
Help me do what?

01:08:17.505 --> 01:08:20.497
You're gonna help me do what?

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:24.694
- You're a stranger here, no?
- That's right.

01:08:24.785 --> 01:08:28.983
You're going to need friends
that know their way around.

01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:31.055
OK.

01:08:31.145 --> 01:08:33.578
OK, friend that's gonna help me.

01:08:35.865 --> 01:08:37.901
Pleasure to meet you.

01:08:37.984 --> 01:08:42.263
Tell your driver to keep his distance
next time. All right, friend?

01:08:45.385 --> 01:08:47.296
Si.

01:09:03.185 --> 01:09:07.462
- You'll be Stateside by supper time.
- I'm gonna need some help first, though.

01:09:07.545 --> 01:09:10.502
You don't stop bleeding,
you won't last a day in your shape.

01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:14.544
- Is that a yes or is that a no?
- Yeah! But...

01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:16.661
- I'm done killing. I told you that.
- OK.

01:09:16.745 --> 01:09:18.622
Anything else is yours.

01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:29.176
- You're talkin' about war, Crease.
- Exactly. Can you help me?

01:09:31.944 --> 01:09:33.742
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:47.536
Creasy?

01:11:39.745 --> 01:11:42.213
What are you doin' here?

01:11:49.425 --> 01:11:51.734
I came to get my stuff.

01:11:51.825 --> 01:11:55.135
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

01:11:55.225 --> 01:11:58.615
- I borrowed it.
- OK.

01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:01.942
It's crazy, huh?

01:12:02.825 --> 01:12:07.182
One week we're figuring out which
nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm...

01:12:07.265 --> 01:12:09.301
readin' the Bible.

01:12:09.385 --> 01:12:11.945
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.

01:12:16.305 --> 01:12:20.935
I keep thinkin' if only we hadn't...

01:12:23.745 --> 01:12:25.736
It's like...

01:12:27.785 --> 01:12:33.974
My whole life all I've ever thought about
was what I could get for myself.

01:12:34.065 --> 01:12:36.863
Not my own baby.

01:12:39.145 --> 01:12:46.415
She needed me so much, and sometimes
I felt like I had nothin' to give her.

01:12:46.505 --> 01:12:49.383
Just... I don't know what to do.

01:12:51.865 --> 01:12:55.301
- What are you gonna do?
- What I do best.

01:12:55.385 --> 01:12:57.376
I'm gonna kill 'em.

01:12:58.345 --> 01:13:04.784
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

01:13:04.865 --> 01:13:06.696
You kill 'em all.

01:13:34.745 --> 01:13:36.736
Yla Browning.

?Puedo usarsu teléfono?

01:14:18.145 --> 01:14:20.864
- ?Hola?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:14:21.545 --> 01:14:25.174
- Mr Creasy.
- I need the licence... No, excuse me.

01:14:25.265 --> 01:14:30.134
I need the name and address of someone
whose licence number is C5TK8.

01:14:30.225 --> 01:14:33.900
That's C5TK8.

01:14:33.985 --> 01:14:37.898
I got everything but the last digit,
so I need ten possible matches.

01:14:37.985 --> 01:14:40.215
And when do I find out which ofthe ten it is?

01:14:40.305 --> 01:14:42.978
- Eventually.
- But where do I reach you?

01:14:43.065 --> 01:14:45.056
I'll call you.

01:14:50.225 --> 01:14:54.855
AGENCY FOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION
MEXICO CITY

01:14:55.705 --> 01:14:57.184
Do you know who he is?

01:14:57.265 --> 01:15:00.018
Do you know what he's been doing
the last 16 years?

01:15:00.825 --> 01:15:02.338
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand,

01:15:02.425 --> 01:15:03.574
Pakistan...

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:06.259
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon.
Yes, I know all ofthat.

01:15:06.345 --> 01:15:07.573
He's an assassin...

01:15:07.665 --> 01:15:11.704
and you want to help him identify
the owner of a car for him?

01:15:12.305 --> 01:15:15.502
He can go places we can't.

01:15:16.505 --> 01:15:19.303
Ifyou don't want to use him... I will.

01:15:21.825 --> 01:15:23.975
- Mariana...
- ?Si?

01:15:24.065 --> 01:15:26.260
When do I get to sleep with you again?

01:15:26.345 --> 01:15:27.858
We never sleep. We fuck.

01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:29.583
Give it to me.

01:15:30.545 --> 01:15:32.615
Give it to me.

01:15:32.705 --> 01:15:34.980
Gracias.

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:38.258
Ciao.

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:11.454
Maneja.

01:16:11.545 --> 01:16:13.217
Jorge Gonzàlez.

01:16:14.745 --> 01:16:16.303
I'm a Judicial Policeman.

01:16:16.745 --> 01:16:19.703
Drive.

01:16:19.785 --> 01:16:22.060
OK. Maneja.

01:16:46.145 --> 01:16:48.340
What are you gonna do?

01:16:48.425 --> 01:16:50.734
What I do best.

01:16:52.385 --> 01:16:56.378
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

01:16:56.465 --> 01:16:58.456
I'm gonna kill 'em.

01:17:40.345 --> 01:17:41.255
Can you hear me?

01:17:41.585 --> 01:17:42.654
My head hurts.

01:17:46.505 --> 01:17:48.223
I am going to ask questions.

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:52.621
Ifyou don't answer fully and truthfully,

01:17:52.705 --> 01:17:55.014
you will suffer much more than you have to.

01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:57.980
I'm going to cut your fingers off.

01:18:03.585 --> 01:18:06.179
One by one, if I have to.

01:18:07.185 --> 01:18:09.255
This is to stop the bleeding.

01:18:10.545 --> 01:18:12.581
OK? Ahora.

01:18:12.665 --> 01:18:14.895
Don't mess with me.

01:18:14.985 --> 01:18:17.101
?Sabes quién soyyo?

01:18:17.185 --> 01:18:19.858
You know who I am?

01:18:21.225 --> 01:18:23.693
A member of La Hermandad.

01:18:24.905 --> 01:18:27.544
- ?Correcto?
- Correct.

01:18:28.025 --> 01:18:29.253
OK.

01:18:38.825 --> 01:18:42.784
!No mames!
!No me quemes, pendejo de mierda!

01:18:42.865 --> 01:18:43.980
!Suelta!

01:18:51.665 --> 01:18:56.056
- Chinga a tu madre, pinche pendejo.
- Yeah. Ytù. Ytù.

01:18:59.385 --> 01:19:04.413
What do you want to know?

01:19:05.225 --> 01:19:06.544
The Ramos kidnapping...

01:19:08.265 --> 01:19:11.575
What went wrong at the drop?

01:19:12.945 --> 01:19:14.697
No sé nada.

01:19:14.785 --> 01:19:17.458
We were just ordered to take her.

01:19:18.185 --> 01:19:19.937
That's all we did.

01:19:20.985 --> 01:19:21.861
Ordered by who?

01:19:22.185 --> 01:19:23.413
I don't know.

01:19:23.745 --> 01:19:25.975
You don't know?

01:19:26.065 --> 01:19:29.182
!No sé!!No sé!

01:19:31.385 --> 01:19:32.613
!No sé!!No sé!

01:19:32.705 --> 01:19:33.979
We work in separate groups.

01:19:34.065 --> 01:19:35.100
A voice calls.

01:19:35.185 --> 01:19:36.254
We grab the target

01:19:36.345 --> 01:19:39.303
and deliver it to the guardians.

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:44.617
The bosses never see the target,

01:19:44.945 --> 01:19:46.458
theyjust make the deal.

01:19:46.545 --> 01:19:48.615
!Eso es todo!

01:19:48.705 --> 01:19:50.900
Who ordered it?

01:19:55.705 --> 01:19:56.740
We call him "The Voice".

01:19:57.265 --> 01:19:58.744
"The Voice." OK.

01:19:59.305 --> 01:20:00.420
"The Voice", si.

01:20:01.745 --> 01:20:03.064
The Voice.

01:20:04.585 --> 01:20:05.859
The Voice. How do I find him?

01:20:12.025 --> 01:20:14.061
You don't know?

01:20:15.105 --> 01:20:16.902
Are you sure?

01:20:22.865 --> 01:20:24.583
OK.

01:20:25.585 --> 01:20:27.576
OK.

01:20:29.665 --> 01:20:32.737
I believe you.

01:20:44.065 --> 01:20:45.737
Tell me about the guardians.

01:20:49.705 --> 01:20:51.297
I'm a professional.

01:20:52.465 --> 01:20:55.025
I'm a professional. I just do myjob.

01:20:58.065 --> 01:21:01.102
Tell me about the guardians.

01:21:04.185 --> 01:21:07.063
- Guardianes.
- Guardianes, OK. Guardianes.

01:21:11.345 --> 01:21:12.778
You don't know?

01:21:12.865 --> 01:21:14.856
I don't know.

01:21:17.785 --> 01:21:19.855
!No me mates, cabron!

01:21:19.945 --> 01:21:22.698
!Ya déjame en paz, cabron!

01:21:27.425 --> 01:21:29.814
He works the door at a rave in Neza.

01:21:29.905 --> 01:21:30.894
He has a mark

01:21:30.985 --> 01:21:32.862
on the left side of his face.

01:21:32.945 --> 01:21:35.220
They call him "The Butcher".

01:21:36.385 --> 01:21:37.420
Is he La Hermandad?

01:21:37.825 --> 01:21:40.020
Yes, La Hermandad.

01:21:43.185 --> 01:21:44.459
OK.

01:21:44.545 --> 01:21:47.013
Wait, wait, wait.

01:21:48.185 --> 01:21:50.221
Give me one cigarette, please, eh?

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:52.535
Si.

01:21:53.545 --> 01:21:55.740
OK.

01:21:57.665 --> 01:21:59.781
?Bueno?

01:22:01.305 --> 01:22:02.738
OK, my friend.

01:22:03.865 --> 01:22:06.538
It's offto the next life for you.

01:22:07.865 --> 01:22:10.857
I guarantee you won't be lonely.

01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:37.540
Revenge is a meal best served cold.

01:23:21.865 --> 01:23:24.584
The Rave - Neza

01:24:09.305 --> 01:24:11.375
Tell me about the girl.

01:24:11.465 --> 01:24:12.659
I don't know her.

01:24:12.745 --> 01:24:14.781
- !La niña!
- No.

01:24:16.225 --> 01:24:17.021
!Vamos!

01:24:49.065 --> 01:24:50.214
?Qué hay?

01:24:59.505 --> 01:25:01.894
OK, OK. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:25:06.465 --> 01:25:08.023
Tell me about the girl.

01:25:12.865 --> 01:25:13.820
Do you know her?

01:25:17.825 --> 01:25:19.497
No?

01:25:33.665 --> 01:25:37.783
Hey, man, I heard you speaking Spanish
over there. You're American, right?

01:25:37.865 --> 01:25:39.662
- And so are you.
- Yeah.

01:25:39.745 --> 01:25:42.134
- Get outta here. Where you from?
- New Jersey.

01:25:42.225 --> 01:25:44.341
New Jersey? I'm from New Jersey.

01:25:44.425 --> 01:25:45.858
All right, listen to me.

01:25:45.945 --> 01:25:48.778
Tell me how it works. The whole thing.
Tell me how it works.

01:25:48.865 --> 01:25:51.299
All right, everything is done by cellphone.

01:25:51.385 --> 01:25:54.741
You just wait around for calls.
We don't even have a fuckin' number.

01:25:54.825 --> 01:25:56.816
- Who pays you?
- We got an ATM card.

01:25:56.905 --> 01:26:01.774
We take out 200 fuckin' measly dollars
every two weeks.

01:26:03.385 --> 01:26:04.659
- 200 dollars?
- Yeah.

01:26:04.745 --> 01:26:07.578
- OK. What's the PIN number?

01:26:07.665 --> 01:26:10.941
- The PIN number, code number.

01:26:13.025 --> 01:26:14.140
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:26:14.225 --> 01:26:16.022
- You wouldn't lie to me?
- I'm not lyin'.

01:26:16.105 --> 01:26:18.061
- You didn't kill her, did you?
- No.

01:26:21.465 --> 01:26:22.420
Don't lie to me!

01:26:22.505 --> 01:26:26.293
- Don't lie to me! Did you kill her?
- You're makin' me fuckin' nervous.

01:26:26.385 --> 01:26:29.183
- Did you kill her?
- No! The fuckin' boss did, or his brother.

01:26:29.305 --> 01:26:31.296
Who's the boss?

01:26:32.025 --> 01:26:34.380
- We never see his face.
- You're lyin' to me.

01:26:35.145 --> 01:26:36.624
I'm tellin' you the truth!

01:26:36.705 --> 01:26:38.263
Who? You never seen whose face?

01:26:38.345 --> 01:26:40.654
Well, we were in the other room.

01:26:41.545 --> 01:26:47.097
And he was yellin' at the girl cos his nephew
got killed and the money got stolen.

01:26:47.185 --> 01:26:50.655
- Wait. Somebody stole what money?
- The ransom money at the drop.

01:26:50.745 --> 01:26:53.543
- Who stole it?
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:55.263
- Who?
- Fuentes.

01:26:55.345 --> 01:26:57.381
- Fuentes?
- Yeah, that's him.

01:26:58.545 --> 01:27:00.342
All right?

01:27:00.425 --> 01:27:02.893
- Jersey boy?
- Yeah.

01:27:06.105 --> 01:27:07.777
- This Fuentes guy...
- Yeah?

01:27:08.785 --> 01:27:11.094
He's a lieutenant
for the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

01:27:11.185 --> 01:27:12.095
- Fuentes is?
- Yeah.

01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:14.540
- What'd you do?
- Oh, man.

01:27:14.625 --> 01:27:17.503
Tell me about the girl. What did you do?

01:27:17.585 --> 01:27:20.145
- I just do what they tell me.
- You do what they tell you to do?

01:27:20.225 --> 01:27:23.103
Did you say goodbye to her?
Answer. Did you say goodbye to her?

01:27:23.185 --> 01:27:24.618
- No!
- You didn't?

01:27:24.705 --> 01:27:26.855
- Here's your chance. Say goodbye.
- Oh, shit.

01:27:26.945 --> 01:27:29.698
Say goodbye to her. Say goodbye to her.

01:27:29.785 --> 01:27:31.662
Motherfucker, let me go!

01:27:34.465 --> 01:27:35.784
?Hijo?

01:27:51.385 --> 01:27:53.535
They threw the little girl against the wall.

01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:57.743
She wasn't moving.

01:27:58.865 --> 01:28:02.141
They threw her body in the trunk ofthe car,

01:28:03.265 --> 01:28:05.301
and then they drove away.

01:28:05.385 --> 01:28:08.104
Who? Who? Who's they?

01:28:09.425 --> 01:28:11.017
The boss's brother.

01:28:12.545 --> 01:28:14.740
I recognised his voice.

01:28:15.265 --> 01:28:17.460
OK. OK.

01:28:20.665 --> 01:28:21.814
Now listen to me.

01:28:21.905 --> 01:28:25.056
Ifyou tell me where to find the boss,

01:28:27.625 --> 01:28:28.944
I'll let you live.

01:28:30.665 --> 01:28:32.656
But I don't know.

01:28:36.585 --> 01:28:38.257
I'll give you the girl.

01:28:39.905 --> 01:28:41.657
I'll give you the girl.

01:28:42.665 --> 01:28:43.814
What girl?

01:28:44.305 --> 01:28:45.021
The girl...

01:28:45.585 --> 01:28:47.337
Do you want the girl?

01:28:47.985 --> 01:28:51.102
Yes, yes, but what girl?
What are you saying?

01:28:51.185 --> 01:28:52.584
- The girl.
- Here?

01:28:52.665 --> 01:28:53.541
Si.

01:28:56.225 --> 01:28:57.021
You sure?

01:28:57.105 --> 01:28:58.254
Si.

01:29:00.385 --> 01:29:01.738
Show me.

01:30:30.465 --> 01:30:32.535
- Si. Guerrero.
- Listen, it's me.

01:30:32.625 --> 01:30:36.618
Do you know about a young girl being
kidnapped recently, about 12 years old?

01:30:36.705 --> 01:30:40.539
- Yes, last night. Do you know something?
- What's her name?

01:30:40.625 --> 01:30:42.536
Camila. Camila Valencias.

01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:46.662
- ?Camila? ?Se Ilama Camila?
- Si.

01:30:46.745 --> 01:30:49.054
- I got her.
- Where are you?

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:22.417
- Creasy, what happened?
- It's OK. Sit down, relax.

01:31:22.505 --> 01:31:25.178
- Camila, ?estàs bien?
- She's OK, she's OK.

01:31:25.265 --> 01:31:27.733
You got banking connections?

01:31:27.825 --> 01:31:29.736
Yes, I have connections.

01:31:32.305 --> 01:31:37.902
PIN number's 4747. I wanna find out
who's puttin' money in that account.

01:31:37.985 --> 01:31:40.215
4747.

01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:44.255
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

01:31:44.345 --> 01:31:48.543
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.
He drove Samuel Ramos to the drop.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:51.662
- Fuentes?
- Who is she?

01:31:51.745 --> 01:31:54.054
You can ask her later.
She'll tell you anything.

01:31:54.145 --> 01:31:56.579
What do you know about Fuentes?

01:31:56.665 --> 01:32:00.658
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

01:32:00.745 --> 01:32:06.377
Never charged. The arresting officer
couldn't testify cos he was dead.

01:32:06.465 --> 01:32:08.615
Was he La Hermandad?

01:32:08.705 --> 01:32:13.859
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a Judicial compound.

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:16.778
He travels by motorcade.

01:32:19.465 --> 01:32:22.025
He's better protected
than the president of Mexico.

01:32:22.105 --> 01:32:24.221
He's gonna need it.
Can you take care of her?

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:27.103
- Yes, but how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

01:32:53.665 --> 01:32:55.735
This is myjurisdiction.

01:32:57.425 --> 01:33:00.701
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

01:33:01.785 --> 01:33:06.222
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than ten years ofyour courts and tribunals.

01:33:06.305 --> 01:33:08.375
Just stay out of his way.

01:33:08.465 --> 01:33:10.057
I plan to.

01:33:17.305 --> 01:33:19.694
I will even help him, if I can.

01:33:20.865 --> 01:33:24.619
But... I'd like to understand him.

01:33:27.025 --> 01:33:29.175
Give me that.

01:33:29.265 --> 01:33:31.256
Pita Ramos...

01:33:32.705 --> 01:33:34.980
is a number to you.

01:33:35.065 --> 01:33:38.774
One more dead, but a number.

01:33:39.545 --> 01:33:44.175
- What was she to Creasy, then?
- She showed him it was all right to live again.

01:33:47.025 --> 01:33:50.222
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?

01:33:51.145 --> 01:33:56.424
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

01:33:56.985 --> 01:33:59.579
A man can be an artist...

01:34:02.305 --> 01:34:04.944
at anything - food, whatever.

01:34:05.025 --> 01:34:09.382
It depends on how good he is at it.

01:34:12.345 --> 01:34:14.336
Creasy's art is death.

01:34:16.985 --> 01:34:19.863
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

01:34:27.625 --> 01:34:30.423
I don't have anything else to say.

01:34:54.985 --> 01:34:59.342
I need the accounts linked to this card.

01:35:04.225 --> 01:35:08.935
PIN number is 4747.

01:35:09.625 --> 01:35:12.935
On one condition.

01:35:56.385 --> 01:36:00.014
I'm not here to hurt you.

01:36:13.105 --> 01:36:15.494
In the church, they say to forgive.

01:36:15.585 --> 01:36:17.860
Forgiveness is between them and God.

01:36:17.945 --> 01:36:20.743
It's myjob to arrange the meeting.

01:38:13.185 --> 01:38:14.903
Don't move. Put your hands down.

01:38:24.425 --> 01:38:26.734
Señor John W Creasy is under arrest

01:38:26.825 --> 01:38:29.498
for the murder oftwo officers
ofthe Judicial Police...

01:38:29.585 --> 01:38:32.577
Creasy!

01:38:32.665 --> 01:38:34.223
Creasy!

01:39:06.425 --> 01:39:08.700
Can you hear me? Huh?

01:39:10.545 --> 01:39:12.615
You know where we are?

01:39:13.665 --> 01:39:15.895
We're under the bridge

01:39:15.985 --> 01:39:20.695
where the deal went bad
and the ransom got stolen.

01:39:20.785 --> 01:39:22.662
You wanna tell me what happened?

01:39:22.745 --> 01:39:25.179
- You've heard of La Hermandad?
- Yes, I have.

01:39:25.265 --> 01:39:27.256
- You know what it is?
- Yes.

01:39:27.385 --> 01:39:29.580
I'm the president of La Hermandad.

01:39:29.665 --> 01:39:30.984
- You're the president?
- Yes.

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:33.215
The president? Wow.

01:39:34.385 --> 01:39:36.376
Look at me.

01:39:36.465 --> 01:39:39.775
Oh, you can't. I'm sorry. How's that?

01:39:49.425 --> 01:39:51.575
I'll show you what I got here.

01:39:51.665 --> 01:39:53.940
See this? This is a charger.

01:39:54.025 --> 01:39:56.823
It's used by convicts
to hide money and drugs.

01:39:56.905 --> 01:40:01.615
They stick it in their body, they tuck it
up their rectum. You familiar with that?

01:40:01.705 --> 01:40:04.503
This... Look at me. Pencil detonator.

01:40:04.585 --> 01:40:08.544
Timer. Used as a receiver, a transmitter.

01:40:09.545 --> 01:40:12.457
C4. Highly explosive.

01:40:12.545 --> 01:40:14.695
You put 'em all together, you got a bomb.

01:40:14.785 --> 01:40:19.097
Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.

01:40:19.185 --> 01:40:21.858
That's what you have in your ass right now.

01:40:21.945 --> 01:40:24.061
Don't move. Don't move.

01:40:24.145 --> 01:40:25.260
Don't move.

01:40:29.305 --> 01:40:31.421
Cheap watch, pager watch,

01:40:31.505 --> 01:40:37.341
used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

01:40:37.425 --> 01:40:38.540
So...

01:40:38.625 --> 01:40:42.334
I'm gonna send you a page
which you will receive...

01:40:44.265 --> 01:40:46.779
in five minutes.

01:40:48.345 --> 01:40:50.017
Now...

01:40:54.145 --> 01:40:56.943
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down

01:40:57.025 --> 01:40:59.255
between your men and the kidnapper.

01:40:59.345 --> 01:41:01.495
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

01:41:01.585 --> 01:41:04.657
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

01:41:04.745 --> 01:41:08.181
You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.

01:41:10.185 --> 01:41:13.939
Four minutes and 20 seconds. Are you sure?

01:41:14.905 --> 01:41:16.577
OK.

01:41:17.585 --> 01:41:20.782
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

01:41:20.865 --> 01:41:23.538
- Relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

01:41:23.625 --> 01:41:25.980
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

01:41:26.065 --> 01:41:30.695
- I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky.
- And?

01:41:30.785 --> 01:41:33.743
And I had my men ready,
as we got instructions where to go.

01:41:33.825 --> 01:41:38.023
You had your men ready to steal the drop,
ready to kill one ofthe kidnappers, yeah?

01:41:38.105 --> 01:41:39.060
You've done this many times.

01:41:39.465 --> 01:41:40.136
What's going on, guys?

01:41:42.465 --> 01:41:45.662
- One ofthe nephews ofthe head kidnapper.
- Bingo, bingo, yeah.

01:41:45.745 --> 01:41:47.656
You've done this many times.

01:41:47.745 --> 01:41:48.700
Many times, yes.

01:41:48.785 --> 01:41:51.982
Yeah. You've killed
many victims too, haven't you?

01:41:52.065 --> 01:41:56.058
- We just make out as best we can.
- "As best we could"?

01:41:57.705 --> 01:41:59.775
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

01:42:02.225 --> 01:42:04.341
Wait a minute.

01:42:04.425 --> 01:42:07.542
- Come on, I have a little gift for you.
- For me?

01:42:07.625 --> 01:42:10.776
- Yeah, come on.
- What have you got?

01:42:10.865 --> 01:42:14.494
There was no $10 million.
There was two and a half in the bags.

01:42:14.585 --> 01:42:18.339
The ransom was $10 million.
They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag.

01:42:18.425 --> 01:42:22.577
Two bags, true, but one has half paper,

01:42:22.665 --> 01:42:25.020
the other only paper.

01:42:26.025 --> 01:42:28.175
Maybe your men stole it.

01:42:28.265 --> 01:42:32.304
No, no. Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

01:42:34.225 --> 01:42:35.624
OK.

01:42:35.705 --> 01:42:39.141
At the Ramos house, before the exchange,

01:42:39.225 --> 01:42:42.023
who put the bags into the car?

01:42:42.105 --> 01:42:43.982
- Guess what.
- What?

01:42:44.065 --> 01:42:47.137
Ramos' lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.

01:43:03.985 --> 01:43:06.624
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for the girl.

01:43:06.705 --> 01:43:08.502
It was just business, you know?

01:43:13.865 --> 01:43:16.379
Everybody keeps saying that to me.

01:43:16.465 --> 01:43:20.856
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it.
Do you understand me?

01:43:23.545 --> 01:43:25.695
What are you going to do now?

01:43:25.785 --> 01:43:27.776
What am I gonna do? Leave. I gotta go.

01:43:27.865 --> 01:43:30.902
Go? Hey, come on, come on.
What about me?

01:43:30.985 --> 01:43:33.340
What about you? You got 40 seconds.

01:43:33.425 --> 01:43:34.904
- Come on.
- 35!

01:43:34.985 --> 01:43:37.453
Give me a last wish, please, please.

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:40.298
Last wish? I wish...

01:43:40.385 --> 01:43:43.297
you had more time.

01:44:31.065 --> 01:44:34.455
JORDAN KALFUS RESIDENCE

01:45:47.145 --> 01:45:48.373
?Hola?

01:45:48.465 --> 01:45:51.104
- Mariana, it's me.
- Creasy, where are you?

01:45:51.185 --> 01:45:55.019
I got something like banking codes
from Bankcoast in the Cayman lslands.

01:45:55.105 --> 01:45:58.336
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

01:45:58.425 --> 01:45:59.938
Jordan Kalfus.

01:46:00.025 --> 01:46:06.624
It looks like US deposits and withdrawals.
Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.

01:46:06.705 --> 01:46:08.297
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:46:09.425 --> 01:46:10.062
OK.

01:46:35.385 --> 01:46:37.376
Poraqui, porfavor.

01:46:54.025 --> 01:46:56.380
Creasy.

01:46:56.465 --> 01:46:58.262
- Samuel.
- Honey?

01:47:03.865 --> 01:47:06.095
What's goin' on?

01:47:06.185 --> 01:47:08.255
That's what I wanna know.

01:47:09.305 --> 01:47:10.624
What is goin' on?

01:47:12.545 --> 01:47:14.536
Sam?

01:47:15.785 --> 01:47:20.734
I'm gonna ask your wife
a couple of questions, OK? You move...

01:47:20.825 --> 01:47:23.020
You make one sound...

01:47:23.945 --> 01:47:28.814
and I'll snatch the life right out ofyou,
you understand?

01:47:32.745 --> 01:47:34.815
What happened, Lisa?

01:47:36.305 --> 01:47:40.457
Were you in on this,
or was itjust your husband?

01:47:40.545 --> 01:47:42.422
- Am I in on what?
- You know what.

01:47:42.505 --> 01:47:45.065
Pita's kidnapping, her death.
Were you a part of it?

01:47:45.145 --> 01:47:48.376
- Pita got killed because the ransom...
- Shut up!

01:47:49.585 --> 01:47:51.974
Yeah, the money was stolen, you're right.

01:47:52.065 --> 01:47:57.503
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen? $2.5 million, right?

01:47:57.585 --> 01:48:00.497
- What are you talkin' about?
- He knows what I'm talkin' about.

01:48:00.585 --> 01:48:03.179
- That's what Victor got.
- What are you talkin' about?

01:48:03.265 --> 01:48:06.940
2.5 million.
2.5 million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

01:48:07.025 --> 01:48:13.180
He put it in an account in the Cayman lslands,
but he won't get a chance to spend it.

01:48:13.865 --> 01:48:16.060
What happened to the other five, Sam?

01:48:16.145 --> 01:48:17.737
That's 2.5, 2.5.

01:48:17.825 --> 01:48:20.897
What is five from ten? Five.
What happened to the other five?

01:48:20.985 --> 01:48:22.737
Tell your wife. This is your chance.

01:48:22.825 --> 01:48:24.736
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't.

01:48:24.825 --> 01:48:27.498
You'll never know how hard it is
to tell your wife the truth.

01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:30.383
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

01:48:30.465 --> 01:48:34.583
- It was in this room that my father...
- I don't give a fuck about your father!

01:48:34.665 --> 01:48:38.419
He prayed for his gambling debts
and his infidelities to be forgiven.

01:48:38.505 --> 01:48:39.824
- Samuel!
- What?

01:48:39.905 --> 01:48:44.501
- I love you! Tell me the truth!
- I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!

01:48:44.585 --> 01:48:47.736
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess!

01:48:47.825 --> 01:48:50.658
- Tell me what happened to my baby!
- I inherited his lawyer!

01:48:50.745 --> 01:48:53.179
Say it! Say it! Say it!

01:48:53.265 --> 01:48:55.825
Say it! Be a fuckin' man!

01:48:59.265 --> 01:49:03.543
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room
and watch cartoons all day.

01:49:03.625 --> 01:49:05.934
And she'd eat ice cream.

01:49:06.025 --> 01:49:09.620
And we'd have her back in two days.
He lied to me!

01:49:09.705 --> 01:49:12.503
That's why he's fucking dead. I did it!

01:49:12.585 --> 01:49:14.576
I did it, Lisa!

01:49:15.145 --> 01:49:17.261
I agreed to the kidnapping.

01:49:17.345 --> 01:49:20.701
I did it for us. For the three of us.

01:49:28.425 --> 01:49:30.416
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

01:49:36.545 --> 01:49:38.536
You kill him.

01:49:39.945 --> 01:49:41.663
You kill him, or I will.

01:50:11.585 --> 01:50:13.701
You know how they say a...

01:50:15.025 --> 01:50:17.983
bullet always tells the truth.

01:50:26.585 --> 01:50:28.576
It never lies.

01:50:40.825 --> 01:50:43.703
It didn't work for me, Samuel,

01:50:43.785 --> 01:50:45.776
but maybe...

01:50:48.825 --> 01:50:51.703
maybe it'll work for you.

01:50:59.985 --> 01:51:01.384
I'll pray for you.

01:52:34.025 --> 01:52:37.222
This is definitely the address
from the ATM card.

01:52:38.745 --> 01:52:42.135
The PIN number was a great locator.

01:52:42.225 --> 01:52:46.696
But there's no one that sounds
anything like The Voice.

01:52:48.625 --> 01:52:51.093
Who's that?

01:52:51.905 --> 01:52:53.179
He's the man,

01:52:53.265 --> 01:52:54.664
The Voice.

01:52:55.265 --> 01:52:57.415
My guys got into the house...

01:52:58.825 --> 01:53:01.498
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.

01:53:04.105 --> 01:53:06.300
We had to inject the whole barrio.

01:53:08.825 --> 01:53:12.864
We bugged the house
and stole the picture of him.

01:53:21.025 --> 01:53:23.937
Now it's time to pursue him.

01:53:24.945 --> 01:53:28.221
We have to put his photo in
tomorrow's newspaper.

01:54:02.225 --> 01:54:05.103
Ifyou value your life,

01:54:05.225 --> 01:54:08.262
you won't publish those photos.

01:54:21.745 --> 01:54:23.258
- ?Hola?
- Hola.

01:54:23.345 --> 01:54:26.143
- Mr Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:54:26.225 --> 01:54:29.297
I traced the PIN for you and I have an address.

01:54:29.385 --> 01:54:30.135
Yeah?

01:54:30.225 --> 01:54:33.581
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,
the wife of "The Voice".

01:54:33.665 --> 01:54:37.783
She lives in Los Arcos,
apartment 26D, via Appia.

01:54:37.865 --> 01:54:40.220
- Good.
- And another thing.

01:54:40.305 --> 01:54:42.535
In today's paper is a picture of The Voice.

01:54:42.625 --> 01:54:44.024
"FEAR HAS A VOICE."

01:54:44.105 --> 01:54:45.663
Good. Thank you.

01:55:56.665 --> 01:55:57.495
He's in.

01:55:57.585 --> 01:55:59.223
What do we do?

01:55:59.785 --> 01:56:00.854
Nothing... Nothing.

01:56:49.305 --> 01:56:51.216
José, ?qué te pasa?

01:56:52.105 --> 01:56:53.299
Alto, alto, alto...

01:56:53.825 --> 01:56:55.178
Out of my house, you son of a bitch!

01:56:55.265 --> 01:56:56.618
Stop there!

01:57:43.105 --> 01:57:44.743
Get out. The kids out. Now!

01:57:46.905 --> 01:57:49.817
!Salgan, ahora!

01:57:53.665 --> 01:57:54.859
Sit down.

01:57:57.865 --> 01:57:59.298
Sit down!

01:58:01.545 --> 01:58:02.739
Reina Rosas, yes?

01:58:04.345 --> 01:58:06.905
- Si.
- OK.

01:58:11.025 --> 01:58:14.142
Who is this? Who is this?

01:58:16.985 --> 01:58:18.543
?Quién es éste?

01:58:25.625 --> 01:58:27.456
?Quién es éste?

01:58:27.745 --> 01:58:28.222
Daniel.

01:58:28.425 --> 01:58:29.301
Daniel what?

01:58:29.825 --> 01:58:30.940
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.

01:58:32.785 --> 01:58:35.379
The Voice?

01:58:35.465 --> 01:58:38.059
- Si.
- OK.

01:58:38.865 --> 01:58:40.503
And this is his brother?

01:58:42.105 --> 01:58:43.936
- ?Si?
- Si.

01:58:44.105 --> 01:58:45.015
What is his name?

01:58:48.225 --> 01:58:49.214
What is his name?

01:58:50.265 --> 01:58:50.856
Aurelio.

01:58:50.945 --> 01:58:53.539
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez, OK.

01:58:57.945 --> 01:58:59.981
OK.

01:59:06.425 --> 01:59:09.098
And you are Daniel's woman, right?

01:59:09.265 --> 01:59:10.983
- Si.
- ?Si?

01:59:11.065 --> 01:59:12.293
How do you contact him?

01:59:14.945 --> 01:59:16.856
How do you contact him?

01:59:17.145 --> 01:59:19.215
We page him,

01:59:22.585 --> 01:59:24.382
and he calls back on his cellphone.

01:59:27.025 --> 01:59:28.538
Call him.

01:59:39.785 --> 01:59:41.741
There's no signal in here.

01:59:41.825 --> 01:59:44.134
We have to go on the roof.

01:59:46.665 --> 01:59:47.654
Let's go outside.

01:59:56.465 --> 01:59:58.217
Outside.

02:00:08.785 --> 02:00:09.934
Momento.

02:00:10.025 --> 02:00:11.140
They're going to get a call.

02:00:12.505 --> 02:00:14.143
Be ready to track him.

02:00:15.065 --> 02:00:18.535
Ifwe're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.

02:00:39.825 --> 02:00:40.974
Hola, Daniel.

02:00:41.065 --> 02:00:44.375
- Señor Creasy.
- Yeah.

02:00:44.465 --> 02:00:46.854
Yeah, I got your family here.

02:00:46.945 --> 02:00:49.664
Your brother doesn't look too good.

02:00:49.745 --> 02:00:53.658
Yeah, Reina, she's what,
about eight months? Yeah?

02:00:54.545 --> 02:00:57.013
You wanna negotiate?

02:00:59.345 --> 02:01:05.500
The most important thing in life is family.
Do you agree?

02:01:07.145 --> 02:01:08.464
I agree.

02:01:10.105 --> 02:01:12.573
There you are, you have my family.

02:01:12.665 --> 02:01:15.418
Well, most of my family.

02:01:16.025 --> 02:01:19.495
My wife and I are separated.
You know how that is.

02:01:19.585 --> 02:01:23.214
Now, tell me seriously,
how much do you want?

02:01:27.265 --> 02:01:30.621
Your brother wants to speak to you.
Here, hold on.

02:01:35.705 --> 02:01:36.899
What the hell do you want?

02:01:38.425 --> 02:01:40.381
Listen to me! Listen!

02:01:40.465 --> 02:01:43.457
I'll take your family apart
piece by piece. You understand me?

02:01:43.545 --> 02:01:45.581
Piece by piece! Shut up!

02:01:46.705 --> 02:01:49.378
I don't want your money.

02:01:49.465 --> 02:01:52.218
You understand me? You understand me?

02:01:52.305 --> 02:01:54.773
I want you!

02:02:26.145 --> 02:02:27.942
I'm listening.

02:02:28.025 --> 02:02:31.495
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.

02:02:37.025 --> 02:02:40.540
All right. I will give you a life for a life.

02:02:42.065 --> 02:02:44.499
Whose life? What are you talkin' about?

02:02:44.585 --> 02:02:47.304
Whose life, Daniel? I want you!

02:02:47.905 --> 02:02:50.783
I will give you her life. For your life.

02:02:50.865 --> 02:02:55.097
And in exchange, I will get my life back.

02:02:55.185 --> 02:03:00.100
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

02:03:02.745 --> 02:03:05.578
- Pita's dead!
- Creasy!

02:03:06.705 --> 02:03:10.937
I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing.

02:03:11.025 --> 02:03:12.014
She's alive.

02:03:15.945 --> 02:03:17.936
All right.

02:03:19.745 --> 02:03:24.899
I want proof of life, you hear me?
I want proof of life. I want...

02:03:24.985 --> 02:03:28.216
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

02:03:28.305 --> 02:03:32.696
You tell her to tell you to tell me
what she calls her bear.

02:03:43.345 --> 02:03:45.222
Little one...

02:03:45.305 --> 02:03:47.500
What do you call your teddy bear?

02:04:00.865 --> 02:04:02.457
Yeah?

02:04:02.545 --> 02:04:06.015
Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.

02:04:11.105 --> 02:04:12.379
Remember...

02:04:12.465 --> 02:04:14.535
I will give you her life

02:04:14.625 --> 02:04:16.536
for your life

02:04:17.025 --> 02:04:19.300
and the life of my brother.

02:04:21.625 --> 02:04:23.616
OK.

02:04:25.265 --> 02:04:26.857
OK.

02:04:27.865 --> 02:04:31.653
I give you your brother, you give me the girl.

02:04:31.745 --> 02:04:34.464
- All right.
- Where?

02:04:48.545 --> 02:04:52.743
He left the roof. We lost the signal.

02:04:52.825 --> 02:04:54.304
We got cut off.

02:04:56.145 --> 02:04:57.897
We lost him. We lost him.

02:05:00.105 --> 02:05:01.015
Damn.

02:05:17.465 --> 02:05:20.775
- Hello?
- Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

02:05:20.865 --> 02:05:22.856
I think Pita's alive.

02:05:24.705 --> 02:05:26.900
I can't take this any more.

02:05:26.985 --> 02:05:31.661
Take the road to Puebla.
Get offjunction 34, south side.

02:05:31.745 --> 02:05:33.736
I'll meet you there in two hours.

02:06:17.785 --> 02:06:20.015
So where is she?

02:06:21.425 --> 02:06:25.623
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

02:06:30.705 --> 02:06:32.696
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

02:06:33.865 --> 02:06:35.981
Here's his brother.

02:06:37.785 --> 02:06:39.343
Here.

02:06:40.345 --> 02:06:42.984
I'm goin' up on the bridge to get Pita.

02:06:43.065 --> 02:06:47.183
Anything goes wrong, you put it to his head,

02:06:47.265 --> 02:06:50.223
you pull the trigger, all right?

02:06:50.305 --> 02:06:52.739
You understand?

02:06:55.505 --> 02:06:59.942
You don't let him loose

02:07:00.025 --> 02:07:02.698
until she's with you, you got it?

02:07:05.505 --> 02:07:08.144
And you don't wait for me, OK?

02:07:11.385 --> 02:07:14.422
- Yeah.
- You'll be all right. You OK?

02:07:14.505 --> 02:07:15.938
Yeah.

02:08:56.945 --> 02:08:58.617
Creasy!

02:09:00.145 --> 02:09:02.136
Creasy!

02:09:03.265 --> 02:09:05.699
Creasy!

02:09:22.105 --> 02:09:23.584
- You all right?
- Yeah.

02:09:23.665 --> 02:09:26.304
They didn't hurt you?

02:09:27.745 --> 02:09:29.736
Hi.

02:09:31.225 --> 02:09:35.377
All right, your mother's waiting for you.
She's at the end the bridge.

02:09:35.465 --> 02:09:38.935
- OK, you go home.
- OK.

02:09:39.025 --> 02:09:41.823
- All right.
- Where are you going?

02:09:45.145 --> 02:09:47.136
I'm goin' home too.

02:09:49.065 --> 02:09:50.578
I'm goin' to Blue Bayou.

02:09:57.505 --> 02:09:59.496
I got something for you.

02:10:02.345 --> 02:10:04.415
I got the last number too.

02:10:05.745 --> 02:10:07.224
I love you, Creasy.

02:10:10.625 --> 02:10:12.855
And you love me, don't you?

02:10:12.945 --> 02:10:15.220
Yes, I do.

02:10:15.305 --> 02:10:17.375
Now, come on, Pita, go.

02:10:18.385 --> 02:10:20.376
- Go. Run.
- Bye.

02:10:33.305 --> 02:10:35.182
!Vamos!

02:10:35.265 --> 02:10:36.539
Pita!

02:10:36.625 --> 02:10:38.422
- Mom!
- Baby, come here! It's OK!

02:10:38.505 --> 02:10:40.223
- Mom!
- Come on.

02:10:40.305 --> 02:10:42.865
OK, I'll let you go now.

02:10:42.945 --> 02:10:45.459
Mom!

02:14:00.625 --> 02:14:08.020
