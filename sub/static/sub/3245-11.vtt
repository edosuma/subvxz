WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:08.763
There's still no word
from inside Downing Street.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.357
Though we are getting
even more new arrivals.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.146
We are the Slitheen.

00:21.438 --> 00:24.567
Reduce the Earth to
molten slag then sell it.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.785
Leave this planet
or I'll stop you.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.665
The world is in your hands.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.895
I've checked the figures.
I've checked them again and again.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.013
Always the same result.

00:55.847 --> 01:00.023
The design is not safe.
It could result in the death of millions.

01:01.061 --> 01:05.988
I beg of you, stop the project right now
before it's too late.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.945
Well, goodness me!

01:11.154 --> 01:14.078
Obviously, Mr Cleaver,
you're the expert.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.418
Then, you'll stop it?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.747
It seems I have no choice.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.003
Oh, do excuse me.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.010
Civic duties leave little time
for a sandwich.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.183
But you promise
you'll stop it today?

01:31.800 --> 01:33.473
Well, of course!

01:33.594 --> 01:36.347
Nothing is more
important than human life.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.522
What do you take me for?
Some sort of maniac?

01:42.311 --> 01:43.403
Why, no.

01:43.478 --> 01:47.449
Am I right in thinking
you've shown your results only to me?

01:47.858 --> 01:51.112
- Just to you, no one else.
- Wise move.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.365
I can't tell you, Mrs Blaine,
this is such a weight off my mind.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.789
I've barely slept.
I couldn't believe my own readings.

01:57.868 --> 02:02.669
The scale of it. Destruction like
the British Isles has never seen before.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.459
If I didn't know better,

02:05.542 --> 02:08.261
I'd almost think that someone
wanted this project to go wrong.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.342
As though they intended this city
should be wiped off the map.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.473
Thank goodness we've got you,
our esteemed leader.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.102
Who the hell are you?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.648
What do you mean, who the hell am I?
Who the hell are you?

03:42.764 --> 03:45.392
Captain jack Harkness.
Whatever you're selling, we're not buying.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.609
Get out of my way!

03:47.811 --> 03:49.779
Don't tell me,
this must be Mickey.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.819
Here comes trouble.
How you doing, Ricky boy?

03:51.898 --> 03:54.526
- It's Mickey.
- Don't listen to him, he's winding you up.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.407
You look fantastic.

03:56.653 --> 04:00.203
Aw, sweet. Look at these two.
How come I never get any of that?

04:00.282 --> 04:02.455
- Buy me a drink first.
- You're such hard work.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.751
But worth it.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.955
Did you manage to find it?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.835
- There you go.
- I can go anywhere now.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.632
I've told you,
you don't need a passport.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.678
It's all very well
going to Platform One and Justicia

04:12.753 --> 04:16.132
and the Glass Pyramid of San Kaloon,
but what if we end up in Brazil?

04:16.214 --> 04:19.387
I might need it.
You see, I'm prepared for anything.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.470
Sounds like you're staying, then.

04:26.850 --> 04:30.070
So, what are you doing in Cardiff?
And who the hell's jumping jack Flash?

04:30.145 --> 04:32.185
I don't mind you hanging out
with Big Ears up there.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.857
- Oi!
- Look in the mirror.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.319
- But this guy, I don't know, he's kind of...
- Handsome?

04:37.402 --> 04:38.619
More like cheesy.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.949
Early 21st century slang.
Is cheesy good or bad?

04:42.032 --> 04:44.660
- It's bad.
- But bad means good, isn't that right?

04:44.743 --> 04:45.960
You saying I'm not handsome?

04:46.036 --> 04:48.334
We've just stopped off,
we need to refuel.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.883
The thing is, Cardiff's got this rift
running through the middle of the city.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.462
It's invisible, but it's like an earthquake
fault between different dimensions.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.047
The rift was healed back in 1869...

04:57.130 --> 04:59.930
Thanks to a girl named Gwyneth
because these creatures called the Gelth

05:00.008 --> 05:03.137
were using the rift as a gateway,
but she saved the world and closed it.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.099
But closing a rift always leaves a scar
and that scar generates energy,

05:06.181 --> 05:07.433
harmless to the human race...

05:07.516 --> 05:08.608
But perfect for the Tardis.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.527
Just park here for a couple of days,
right on top of the scar and...

05:11.603 --> 05:13.731
Open up the engines,
soak up the radiation...

05:13.814 --> 05:15.908
Like filling her up
with petrol and off we go.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.076
- Into time.
- And space.

05:18.860 --> 05:22.034
My God, have you seen yourselves?
You all think you're so clever, don't you?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.239
- Yea h.
- Yea h.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.370
Yeah.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.329
Should take another 24 hours
which means we've got time to kill.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.209
That old lady's staring.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.963
Probably wondering what four people can do
inside a small wooden box.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.591
What are you captain of?
The Innuendo Squad?

05:38.421 --> 05:41.846
Wait, the Tardis, you can't just leave it.
Doesn't it get noticed?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.144
Yeah, what's with the police box?
Why does it look like that?

05:44.219 --> 05:46.768
- It's a cloaking device.
- It's called a chameleon circuit.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.088
The Tardis is meant to disguise itself
wherever it lands.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.194
Like, if this was ancient Rome,
it'd be a statue on a plinth or something.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.068
But I landed in the 1960s,
it disguised itself as a police box

05:55.188 --> 05:56.735
and the circuit got stuck.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.238
So, it copied a real thing?
There actually was police boxes?

05:59.317 --> 06:00.443
Yeah, on street corners.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.621
You could phone for help
before they had radios and mobiles.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.661
If they arrested somebody, they could
shove them inside till help came.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.710
- Like a little prison cell.
- Why don't you just fix the circuit?

06:08.827 --> 06:10.500
- I like it, don't you?
- I love it.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.082
But that's what I meant,
there's no police boxes anymore

06:13.164 --> 06:14.882
so doesn't it get noticed?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.837
Ricky, let me tell you something
about the human race.

06:17.919 --> 06:22.265
You put a mysterious blue box slap-bang
in the middle of town, what do they do?

06:22.340 --> 06:24.843
Walk past it. Now, stop your
nagging, let's go and explore.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.303
- What's the plan?
- I don't know.

06:26.428 --> 06:30.228
Cardiff, early 21st century,
and the wind's coming from the... east.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.730
Trust me.
Safest place in the universe.

06:32.809 --> 06:36.484
This nuclear power station
right in the heart of Cardiff city

06:36.563 --> 06:38.611
will bring jobs for all.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.658
As you can see, as Lord Mayor,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.866
I've had to sanction
some radical redevelopments.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.952
No photographs!
What did I say?

06:50.035 --> 06:54.006
Take pictures of the project,
by all means, but not me, thank you.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.427
So, Cardiff Castle will be demolished,

06:58.501 --> 07:02.631
allowing the Blaidd Drwg project
to rise up, tall and proud.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.759
A monument to Welsh industry.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.470
And, yes,
some of you might shiver.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.940
The words "nuclear power station"
and "major population centre"

07:12.015 --> 07:15.064
aren't exactly
the happiest of bedfellows.

07:15.143 --> 07:20.445
But I give you my personal guarantee
that as long as I walk upon this Earth,

07:20.523 --> 07:23.402
no harm will come to any of my citizens.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.699
Now, drink up!

07:25.820 --> 07:28.414
A toast, to the future.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.204
To the future.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.832
And believe me...

07:32.911 --> 07:34.709
it will glow.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.054
Mrs Blaine, my name's Cathy Salt.
I represent the Cardiff Gazette.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.757
I'm sorry, I'm not doing interviews.
I can't bear self-publicity.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.515
- But are you aware of the curse?
- Whatever do you mean?

07:50.178 --> 07:51.930
- Cathy, wasn't it?
- Cathy Salt.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.936
That's what some
of your engineers are saying,

07:54.015 --> 07:55.813
that the Blaidd Drwg project is cursed.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.189
Sounds rather silly to me.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.984
That's what I thought,
I was just chasing a bit of local colour.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.543
But the funny thing is,
when you start piecing it all together,

08:02.607 --> 08:03.904
it does begin to look a bit odd.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.777
- In what way?
- The deaths.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.988
The number of deaths associated
with this project.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.541
First of all, there was the entire team
of the European Safety Inspectors.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.038
But they were French.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.962
It's not my fault if "Danger Explosives"
was only written in Welsh.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.665
And there was that accident
with the Cardiff Heritage Committee.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.469
The electrocution of that swimming pool
was put down to natural wear and tear.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.672
And then the architect?

08:24.879 --> 08:28.349
It was raining, visibility was low,
my car simply couldn't stop.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.725
And then just recently, Mr Cleaver,
the government's nuclear adviser.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.395
Slipped on an icy patch.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.475
- He was decapitated.
- It was a very icy patch.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.982
I'm afraid these stories are nothing more
than typical small-town thinking.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.155
I really haven't got time.
If you'll excuse me.

08:42.230 --> 08:46.485
Except before he died, Mr Cleaver
posted some of his findings online.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.445
- Did he now?
- If you know where to look.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.247
- He was concerned about the reactor.
- All that technical stuff.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.825
Specifically, that the design
of the suppression pool

08:53.908 --> 08:55.831
would cause the hydrogen
recombiners to fail,

08:55.910 --> 08:58.789
precipitating in the collapse
of the containment isolation system

08:58.872 --> 09:00.124
and resulting in a meltdown.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.297
- Who's been doing her homework?
- That's my job.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.550
I think... Cathy Salt...

09:07.714 --> 09:10.593
I think you and I
should have a word in private.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.564
Oh! My little tummy is complaining.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.062
I think we might have to
make a detour to the ladies'.

09:19.142 --> 09:22.692
- I'll wait here.
- Come on. All girls together.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.947
So, you were saying?
These outlandish theories of yours.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.788
- Sounds like we got herejust in time.
- Continue.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.379
Well, I don't know much about
nuclear physics,

09:39.496 --> 09:41.214
but from what I could make out,

09:41.289 --> 09:45.920
Cleaver was saying that the whole project
could go up, worse than Chernobyl.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.178
Is there something wrong with the lights?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.055
They're always on the blink.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.978
I can't tell you how many memos I've sent.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.227
So, Chernobyl?

09:58.306 --> 10:01.401
Apparently,
but a thousand times worse.

10:01.518 --> 10:05.193
I mean, it sounds absurd,
there must be so many safety regulations.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.992
But Cleaver seemed to be talking about
a nuclear holocaust.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.866
He almost made it sound deliberate.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.034
I mean, we're hardly the Sunday Time;

10:14.114 --> 10:15.366
we're only the Cardiff Gazette,

10:15.448 --> 10:18.042
but we still have a duty
to report the facts.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.917
And you're going to
print this information?

10:21.037 --> 10:22.710
Are you all right?
You sound a bit...

10:22.789 --> 10:24.257
Sore throat.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.177
Just a little tickle.

10:28.253 --> 10:32.008
But tell me, do you intend to make
this information public?

10:32.090 --> 10:33.467
I have to.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.891
So be it.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.603
Mind you,
my boyfriend thinks I'm mad.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.397
We're getting married next month

10:43.476 --> 10:46.104
and he says if I cause a fuss,
I could lose my job,

10:46.187 --> 10:48.189
just when we need the money.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.861
- Boyfriend?
- Jeffrey.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.953
Civil servant.
He's nothing exciting, but he's mine.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.740
- When's the wedding?
- The 19th.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.121
It's really just to stop my mother
from nagging,

10:59.200 --> 11:02.374
but the baby sort of
clinched it, I suppose.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.583
You're with child?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.505
Three months,
it's not showing yet.

11:12.964 --> 11:16.844
Wasn't planned, it was an accident.
Nice accident, though.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.596
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.354
- How about you?
- No.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.979
- Is there a Mr Blaine?
- Not anymore.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.439
I'm all on my own.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.159
I had quite a sizeable family
once upon a time.

11:33.234 --> 11:36.363
Wonderful brothers.
Oh, they were bold.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.708
But all of them gone, now.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.579
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm cursed.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.215
No, I don't think so, not really.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.050
You're very kind.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.971
If you don't mind,
I might be a while.

11:54.172 --> 11:57.642
You run along.
Perhaps we could do this another day.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.429
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

12:00.511 --> 12:04.516
Okay, I tell you what,
I'll leave my details with your office.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.897
Thanks for talking.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.229
Thank you.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.508
- I swear!
- You're lying through your teeth!

12:30.583 --> 12:34.258
It turns out the white things are tusks,
and I mean, tusks!

12:34.337 --> 12:35.839
And it's woken and it's not happy.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.219
How could you not know
it was there?

12:37.298 --> 12:39.471
We're standing there,
15 of us, naked.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.053
And I'm like,
"No, it's got nothing to do with me."

12:42.136 --> 12:45.060
And then it roars, and we're running.
My God, we are running.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.525
And Brakovitch falls
so I turn to him and I say...

12:47.600 --> 12:50.444
- I knew we should have turned left!
- That's my line!

12:51.479 --> 12:55.325
I don't believe you, I don't believe a word
you say, ever. That is so brilliant!

12:55.400 --> 12:56.993
Did you ever get
your clothes back?

12:57.068 --> 12:59.321
No, I just picked him up
and went right for the ship.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.949
Full throttle, didn't stop
till I hit the space lanes. I was shaking!

13:03.116 --> 13:06.290
It was unbelievable! Freaked me out.
And by the time I got there,

13:06.369 --> 13:09.794
I was 15 light years away
and I realised I'm like this...

13:09.872 --> 13:12.421
And I was having
such a nice day.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.556
According to Intelligence,

13:26.639 --> 13:29.267
the target is the last surviving member
of the Slitheen family.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.103
A criminal sect from the planet
Rexicoricophalvitorius

13:32.186 --> 13:34.939
masquerading as a human being,
zipped inside a skin suit.

13:35.023 --> 13:38.072
Okay, plan of attack.
We assume a basic 57-56 strategy,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.620
covering all available exits
on the ground ﬂoor.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.494
Doctor, you go face to face,
that'll designate Exit 1.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.292
I'll cover Exit 2.
Rose, you Exit 3,

13:46.367 --> 13:48.995
Mickey Smith, you take Exit 4.
Have you got that?

13:49.078 --> 13:51.331
Excuse me, who's in charge?

13:52.123 --> 13:54.967
Sorry, awaiting orders, sir.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.462
Right, here's the plan.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.553
Like he said.
Nice plan. Anything else?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.597
- Present arms.
- Ready.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.973
- Ready.
- Ready.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.478
- Speed dial?
- Yeah.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.601
- Ready.
- Check.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.523
See you in hell.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.901
Hello, I've come to
see the Lord Mayor.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.531
Have you got an appointment?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.239
No, just an old friend passing by,
bit of a surprise.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.824
Can't wait to see her face.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.251
Well, she's just
having a cup of tea.

14:28.326 --> 14:31.580
Just go in there and tell her
the Doctor would like to see her.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.879
Doctor who?

14:32.955 --> 14:36.585
Just the Doctor.
Tell her exactly that, the Doctor.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.470
Hang on a tick.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.694
The Lord Mayor says thank you
for popping by.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.276
She'd love to have a chat

15:01.359 --> 15:03.361
but she's up to her eyes in paperwork.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.072
Perhaps if you could make an appointment
for next week?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.374
She's climbing out of
the window, isn't she?

15:08.449 --> 15:09.871
Yes, she is.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.091
- Slitheen heading north.
- On my way.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.638
Over and out.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.092
Oh, my God!

15:25.758 --> 15:27.305
Leave the Mayor alone!

16:01.169 --> 16:02.921
Margaret!

16:09.552 --> 16:12.226
- Who's on Exit 4?
- That was Mickey!

16:12.388 --> 16:14.186
- Here I am.
- Mickey the idiot.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.690
Be fair, she's not exactly
gonna outrun us, is she?

16:20.438 --> 16:23.567
She's got a teleport! That's cheating.
Now, we're never gonna get her!

16:23.649 --> 16:26.277
The Doctor's very good at teleports.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.638
I could do this all day.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.183
This is persecution.
Why can't you leave me alone?

16:49.258 --> 16:50.601
What did I ever do to you?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.645
You tried to kill me
and destroy this entire planet.

16:53.721 --> 16:54.847
Apart from that.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.184
So, you're a Slitheen,
you're on Earth, you're trapped.

16:58.267 --> 17:02.147
Your family get killed, but you
teleport out, just in the nick of time.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.444
You have no means of escape,
what do you do?

17:04.523 --> 17:07.493
You build a nuclear power station.
But what for?

17:08.069 --> 17:11.289
A philanthropic gesture.
I've learned the error of my ways.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.958
And it just so happens to be
right on top of the rift.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.752
- What rift would that be?
- A rift in space and time.

17:16.827 --> 17:20.377
If this power station went into meltdown,
the entire planet would go...

17:20.455 --> 17:24.176
This station is designed to explode
the minute it reaches capacity.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.753
Didn't anyone notice?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.305
Isn't there someone in London
checking this sort of stuff?

17:28.381 --> 17:31.180
We're in Cardiff.
London doesn't care.

17:31.259 --> 17:34.559
The South Wales coast could
fall into the sea and they wouldn't notice.

17:34.887 --> 17:39.893
Oh! I sound like a Welshman.
God help me, I've gone native.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.398
But why would she do that?

17:41.477 --> 17:43.718
A great big explosion,
she'd only end up killing herself.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.321
- She's got a name, you know.
- She's not even a she, she's a thing.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.118
Oh, but she's clever.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.917
Fantastic!

17:56.993 --> 18:00.213
Is that a tribophysical waveform
macro-kinetic extrapolator?

18:00.288 --> 18:02.290
Couldn't have put it better myself.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.297
Genius! You didn't build this?

18:05.376 --> 18:07.253
I have my hobbies,
a little tinkering.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.886
No, I mean, you really didn't build this.
Way beyond you.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.639
- I bet she stole it.
- It fell into my hands.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.141
- Is it a weapon?
- It's transport.

18:17.013 --> 18:21.940
You see, if the reactor blows, the rift opens.
Phenomenal cosmic disaster.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.942
But this thing shrouds
you in a force-field.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.070
You have this energy bubble...
So you're safe.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.527
Then you feed it coordinates,
stand on top

18:30.610 --> 18:33.614
and ride the concussion
all the way out of the solar system.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.575
- It's a surfboard.
- A pan-dimensional surfboard, yeah.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.874
And it would've worked.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.625
I'd have surfed away from this dead-end
dump and back to civilisation.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.672
You'd blow up a whole planet
just to get a lift?

18:43.748 --> 18:46.001
Like stepping on an ant hill.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.260
How did you think of the name?

18:48.336 --> 18:51.465
What? Blaidd Drwg? It's Welsh.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.720
I know,
but how did you think of it?

18:53.799 --> 18:58.270
I chose it at random, that's all, I don't know.
Just sounded good.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.105
Does it matter?

19:03.392 --> 19:04.860
Blaidd Drwg.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.439
- What's it mean?
- "Bad Wolf."

19:08.105 --> 19:13.032
But I've heard that before. Bad Wolf.
I've heard that lots of times.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.080
Everywhere we go,
two words, following us.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.325
Bad Wolf.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.705
How can they be following us?

19:23.537 --> 19:24.959
No, just a coincidence.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.293
Like hearing a word on the radio
then hearing it all day. Never mind.

19:28.376 --> 19:31.050
Things to do. Margaret,
we're gonna take you home.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.506
Hold on, isn't that the easy option?
Like letting her go?

19:33.589 --> 19:36.593
I don't believe it,
we actually get to go to Rexi...

19:36.676 --> 19:39.600
Wait a minute, Rexicor...

19:39.679 --> 19:41.226
Rexicoricophalvitorius.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.558
- Rexicorico...
- Phalvitorius.

19:43.641 --> 19:46.565
- Rexicoricophalvitorius!
- That's it!

19:47.311 --> 19:48.483
I did it!

19:48.562 --> 19:50.815
They have the death penalty.

19:55.403 --> 19:59.328
The family Slitheen was tried
in its absence many years ago

19:59.407 --> 20:01.125
and found guilty.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.461
With no chance of appeal.

20:04.495 --> 20:08.500
According to the statutes of government,
the moment I return, I'm to be executed.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.669
What do you make of that, Doctor?

20:13.421 --> 20:16.345
Take me home and you
take me to my death.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.142
Not my problem.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.401
This ship is impossible!

20:28.602 --> 20:30.070
It's superb!

20:30.187 --> 20:32.736
How do you get the outside
around the inside?

20:32.857 --> 20:35.451
Like I'd give you the secret, yeah.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.488
I almost feel better
about being defeated.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.289
I never stood a chance.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.992
This is the technology of the gods.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.419
Don't worship me,
I'd make a very bad god.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.838
You wouldn't get
a day off, for starters.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.836
Jack, how we doing, big fella?

20:49.915 --> 20:53.795
This extrapolattor's top of the range.
Where did you get it?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.881
I don't know,
some airlock sale.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.977
Must've been a great, big heist.
It's stacked with power.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.100
- But we can use it for fuel?
- It's not compatible.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.808
But it should knock
off about 12 hours.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.188
We'll be ready to go
by morning.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.066
Then we're stuck here, overnight.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.567
I'm in no hurry.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.273
We've got a prisoner.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.610
The police box is really a police box.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.742
You're not just police, though.

21:21.405 --> 21:25.706
Since you're taking me to my death,
that makes you my executioners.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.205
Each and every one of you.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.999
You deserve it.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.548
You're very quick to say so.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.847
And you're very quick
to soak your hands in my blood.

21:38.923 --> 21:42.052
Which makes you
better than me how, exactly?

21:44.178 --> 21:45.930
Long night ahead.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.286
Let's see who can
look me in the eye.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.271
It's freezing out here.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.858
Better than in there.

22:41.652 --> 22:45.122
She does deserve it,
she's a Slitheen, I don't care.

22:45.322 --> 22:48.576
It's just weird in that box.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.538
I didn't really need my passport.

23:01.088 --> 23:05.434
I've been thinking, you know,
we could go have a drink.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.643
Have a pizza or something,
just you and me.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.690
That'd be nice.

23:11.765 --> 23:15.440
And, I mean, if the Tardis
can't leave until morning...

23:18.731 --> 23:21.701
We could go to a hotel.
Spend the night.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.578
I mean, if you want to.
I've got some money.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.075
Okay, yeah.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.290
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

23:31.118 --> 23:35.419
Cool, there's a couple of bars round here,
we should give them a go.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.459
Do you have to go and tell him?

23:38.626 --> 23:40.754
It's none of his business.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.762
So, what's on?

23:47.301 --> 23:49.224
Nothing, just...

23:53.557 --> 23:56.151
I gather it's not always like this.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.313
Having to wait.

24:05.319 --> 24:08.289
I bet you're always
the first to leave, Doctor.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.249
Never mind the consequences,
off you go.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.546
You butchered my family and then
ran for the stars, am I right?

24:16.080 --> 24:18.583
But not this time.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.044
At last, you have consequences.

24:23.504 --> 24:26.383
- How does it feel?
- I didn't butcher them.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.559
Don't answer back,
that's what she wants.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.557
I didn't. What about you?

24:30.636 --> 24:34.857
You had an emergency teleport,
you didn't zap them to safety, did you?

24:34.932 --> 24:36.809
It only carries one.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.144
I had to fly without coordinates.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.152
I ended up in a skip
on the Isle of Dogs.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.364
- It wasn't funny.
- Sorry.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.116
It is a bit funny.

24:57.079 --> 24:59.127
Do I get a last request?

25:00.124 --> 25:01.967
Depends what it is.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.171
I grew quite fond of
my little human life.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.006
All those rituals.

25:07.256 --> 25:11.227
The brushing of the teeth
and the complicated way they cook things.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.597
There's a little restaurant,
just round the Bay.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.308
It became quite a favourite of mine.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.782
- Is that what you want? A last meal?
- Don't I have rights?

25:25.858 --> 25:27.952
Like she's not gonna try to escape.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.998
Except I can never escape the Doctor
so where's the danger?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.333
I wonder if you could do it.

25:40.289 --> 25:44.260
To sit with a creature you're about to kill
and take supper.

25:47.129 --> 25:50.679
- How strong is your stomach?
- Strong enough.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.351
I wonder.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.930
I've seen you fight your enemies.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.190
Now dine with them.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.437
- You won't change my mind.
- Prove it.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.368
There are people out there.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.492
If you slip away just for one second,
they'll be in danger.

26:12.613 --> 26:15.207
Except, I've got these.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.868
You both wear one.

26:17.951 --> 26:20.750
If she moves more
than ten feet away...

26:22.790 --> 26:25.464
She gets zapped
by 10,000 volts.

26:26.752 --> 26:30.552
Margaret, would you like to come out
to dinner? My treat.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.635
Dinner in bondage.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.517
Works for me.

27:16.802 --> 27:20.477
Here we are, out on a date,
and you haven't even asked my proper name.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.270
It's not a date.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.444
- What's your name?
- Blon.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.566
I'm Blon Fel Fotch
Passameer-Day Slitheen.

27:31.275 --> 27:34.074
That's what it'll say
on my death certificate.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.785
- Nice to meet you, Blon.
- I'm sure.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.460
Look, that's where I
was living as Margaret.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.421
Nice little flat,
over there on the top.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.124
Next to the one with the light on.

27:47.249 --> 27:51.470
Two bedrooms, Bayside view.
I was rather content.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.465
Don't suppose I'll see it again.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.145
Suppose not.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.774
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

28:06.143 --> 28:09.738
Tell me, then, Doctor,
what do you know of our species?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.823
Only what I've seen.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.867
Did you know, for example,

28:14.026 --> 28:16.199
in extreme cases,

28:16.361 --> 28:19.331
when her life is in danger,

28:19.406 --> 28:22.706
a female Rexicoricophalvitorian
can manufacture a poison dart

28:22.784 --> 28:24.707
within her own finger.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.380
Yes, I did.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.632
Just checking.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.506
And one more thing.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.591
Between you and me...

28:40.594 --> 28:45.600
As a final resort, the excess
poison can be exhaled through the lungs.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.191
That's better.
Now then, what do you think?

28:50.270 --> 28:52.364
Steak looks nice.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.154
Steak and chips!

28:59.071 --> 29:01.540
The Doctor took me
to this planet a while back.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.492
It was much colder than this.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.790
They called it Woman Wept.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.209
The planet was
actually called Woman Wept

29:08.288 --> 29:10.757
because if you looked at it,
right, from above,

29:10.832 --> 29:14.507
it was like this huge continent,
like, all curved round.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.760
It sort of looked like a woman,
you know, lamenting.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.967
Oh, my God,
and we went to this beach, right.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.269
No people, no buildings,

29:22.511 --> 29:25.390
just this beach,
like, 1,000 miles across.

29:25.889 --> 29:29.189
And something happened,
something to do with the sun, I don't know,

29:29.268 --> 29:31.737
but the sea had just frozen.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.359
In a split second.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.942
In the middle of a storm, right,
waves and foam, just frozen,

29:37.025 --> 29:38.868
all the way out to the horizon.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.868
Midnight, right, we walk
underneath these waves,

29:41.989 --> 29:44.742
100 feet tall and made of ice.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.374
I'm going out
with Trisha Delaney.

29:50.372 --> 29:51.749
Oh, right.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.468
That's nice.

29:55.711 --> 29:59.215
- Trisha from the shop?
- Yeah, Rob Delaney's sister.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.341
Well, she's nice.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.428
- She's a bit big.
- She lost weight.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.524
You've been away.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.068
Well, good for you.
She's nice.

30:13.895 --> 30:17.900
- So, tell us more about this planet, then.
- That was it, really.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.908
Public execution is a slow death.

30:27.409 --> 30:32.131
They prepare a thin acetic acid,
lower me into the cauldron...

30:32.205 --> 30:33.707
and boil me.

30:34.624 --> 30:38.299
The acidity is perfectly gauged
to strip away the skin.

30:38.879 --> 30:43.009
Internal organs fall out into the liquid
and I become soup.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.849
And still alive.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.889
Still screaming.

30:49.139 --> 30:52.109
- I don't make the law.
- But you deliver it.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.978
Will you stay to watch?

30:55.937 --> 30:57.439
What else can I do?

30:57.564 --> 30:59.692
The Slitheen family's huge.

31:00.067 --> 31:03.697
There's a lot more of us,
all scattered off-world. Take me to them.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.572
Take me somewhere safe.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.450
- But then you’ll just start again.
- I promise I won't.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.627
You've been in that skin suit too long.

31:10.702 --> 31:14.332
You've forgotten.
There used to be a real Margaret Blaine.

31:14.414 --> 31:17.042
You killed her and stripped her
and used the skin.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.174
You're pleading for mercy
out of a dead woman's lips.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.472
Perhaps I have got used to it.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.970
A human life, an ordinary life.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.474
That's all I'm asking.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.608
Give me a chance, Doctor.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.062
- I can change.
- I don't believe you.

31:39.523 --> 31:42.527
- So, what do you want to do now?
- Don't mind.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.408
We could ask about hotels.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.832
What would Trisha Delaney say?

31:48.990 --> 31:50.287
I suppose.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.796
There's a bar down there
with a Spanish name...

31:54.871 --> 31:56.293
You don't even
like Trisha Delaney!

31:56.373 --> 31:58.375
Is that right?
What the hell do you know?

31:58.458 --> 32:00.677
I know you and I know her

32:00.752 --> 32:02.675
and I know that's
never gonna happen.

32:02.796 --> 32:06.642
- So, who do you think you're kidding?
- At least I know where she is!

32:08.051 --> 32:09.803
There we are, then.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.932
It's got nothing to do with Trisha.
This is all about me, isn't it?

32:13.014 --> 32:14.436
You left me!

32:17.144 --> 32:19.442
We were nice, we were happy.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.821
And then what?
You give me a kiss and run off with him

32:22.941 --> 32:25.865
and you make me feel like nothing, Rose.
I was nothing!

32:25.944 --> 32:28.367
I can't even go out
with a stupid girl from a shop

32:28.447 --> 32:31.826
because you pick up the phone
and I comes running.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.709
I mean, is that what I am, Rose, standby?

32:35.787 --> 32:38.961
Am I just supposed to sit here
for the rest of my life waiting for you?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.259
- Because I will.
- I'm sorry.

32:50.886 --> 32:54.436
I promise you I've changed
since we last met, Doctor.

32:55.182 --> 32:57.605
There was this girl, just today.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.024
Young thing.

33:01.146 --> 33:04.650
And something of a danger.
She was getting too close.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.611
I felt the blood lust rising,
just as the family taught me.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.664
I was going to kill her without a thought.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.624
And then...

33:14.201 --> 33:15.669
I stopped.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.464
She's alive somewhere,
right now.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.509
She's walking round this city
because I can change.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.803
I did change.

33:24.878 --> 33:27.631
- I know I can't prove it.
- I believe you.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.551
Then you know I'm capable of better.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.393
It doesn't mean anything.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.688
I spared her life.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.733
You let one of them go.
But that's nothing new.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.227
Every now and then
a little victim's spared.

33:40.310 --> 33:43.439
Because she smiled.
Because he's got freckles.

33:43.897 --> 33:45.695
Because they begged.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.903
And that's how you live with yourself.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.534
That's how you slaughter millions.

33:51.988 --> 33:57.586
Because once in a while, on a whim,
if the Wind's in the right direction...

33:57.702 --> 33:59.249
you happen to be kind.

33:59.329 --> 34:01.832
Only a killer would know that.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.425
Is that right?

34:03.500 --> 34:04.877
From what I've seen,

34:04.960 --> 34:08.840
your funny little happy-go-lucky life
leaves devastation in its wake.

34:08.922 --> 34:12.222
Always moving on
because you dare not go back.

34:12.300 --> 34:16.396
Playing with so many people's lives,
you might as well be a god.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.400
And you're right, Doctor.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.610
You're absolutely right.

34:22.768 --> 34:26.114
Sometimes, you let one go.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.784
Let me go.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.670
I'm not asking you to leave him
because I know that's not fair.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.378
But I just need something,
yeah, some sort of promise

34:43.456 --> 34:46.005
that when you do come back,
you're coming back for me.

34:47.668 --> 34:50.422
- Is that thunder?
- Does it matter?

34:50.505 --> 34:52.348
That's not thunder.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.848
In the family Slitheen,
we had no choice.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.688
I was made to carry out
my first kill at 13.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.937
If I'd refused, my father would have fed me
to the Venom Grubs.

35:02.017 --> 35:05.317
If I'm a killer, it's because I was
born to kill. It's all I know.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.529
Doctor, are you even listening to me?

35:09.608 --> 35:12.111
- Can you hear that?
- I'm begging for my life.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.953
No, listen, shush.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.799
Go on, then, run.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.711
It's him again, isn't it? It's the Doctor.
It's always the Doctor.

35:29.836 --> 35:33.056
It's always gonna be the Doctor.
It's never me!

35:34.090 --> 35:35.592
The handcuffs!

35:40.180 --> 35:43.980
- Don't think you're running away.
- I'm sticking with you.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.523
Some date this
turned out to be!

36:00.158 --> 36:02.752
It's the rift.
The rift's opening.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.773
- What the hell are you doing?
- It just went crazy!

36:27.852 --> 36:30.981
It's the rift. Time and
space are ripping apart.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.650
The whole city's
going to disappear.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.028
It's the extrapolator.

37:10.103 --> 37:13.482
I've disconnected it,
but it's still feeding off the engine.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.988
It's using the Tardis,
I can't stop it.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.490
Never mind Cardiff,
it's gonna rip open the planet!

37:18.570 --> 37:20.618
What is it? What's happening?

37:20.697 --> 37:22.791
Just little me.

37:25.535 --> 37:28.789
One wrong move
and she snaps like a promise.

37:28.872 --> 37:30.294
I might have known.

37:30.373 --> 37:34.423
I've had you bleating
all night, poor baby.

37:34.627 --> 37:35.844
Now, shut it.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.260
You, fly boy.

37:38.339 --> 37:40.842
Put the extrapolator at my feet.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.157
Thank you.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.444
Just as I planned.

37:59.736 --> 38:02.615
I thought you needed to blow up
the nuclear power station.

38:02.697 --> 38:06.372
Failing that,
if I were to be arrested,

38:06.451 --> 38:08.749
then anyone capable
of tracking me down

38:08.870 --> 38:11.840
would have considerable technology
of their own.

38:11.915 --> 38:16.887
Therefore, they would be
captivated by the extrapolator.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.136
Especially a magpie-mind
like yours, Doctor.

38:21.883 --> 38:25.979
So, the extrapolator was programmed
to go to Plan B.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.432
To lock on to the nearest
alien power source

38:29.516 --> 38:31.644
and open the rift.

38:32.769 --> 38:35.818
And what a power source it found.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.316
I'm back on schedule.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.778
Thanks to you.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.660
The rift's gonna convulse,
you'll destroy the whole planet.

38:44.781 --> 38:46.454
And you with it.

38:48.076 --> 38:52.923
While I ride this board
over the crest of the inferno,

38:52.997 --> 38:55.125
all the way to freedom.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.129
Stand back, boys.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.556
Surf's up.

39:15.144 --> 39:18.318
Of course, opening the rift
means you'll pull this ship apart.

39:18.398 --> 39:19.991
So sue me.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.402
It's not just any old power source.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.905
It's the Tardis, my Tardis.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.532
The best ship in the universe.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.743
It'll make wonderful scrap.

39:30.118 --> 39:33.292
- What's that light?
- The heart of the Tardis.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.544
This ship's alive.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.792
You've opened its soul.

39:42.672 --> 39:46.848
It's... so bright.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.096
Look at it, Margaret.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.352
Beautiful.

39:52.765 --> 39:55.234
Look inside, Blon Fel Fotch.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.150
Look at the light.

40:28.343 --> 40:29.890
Thank you.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.151
Don't look,
stay there, close your eyes!

40:45.818 --> 40:48.321
Now, jack, come on, shut it all down.
Shut down.

40:48.404 --> 40:52.375
Rose, that panel over there,
turn all switches to the right.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.430
Nicely done.
Thank you, all.

41:11.052 --> 41:12.895
What happened to Margaret?

41:12.971 --> 41:15.394
Must've got burned up.
Carried out her own death sentence.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.771
No, I don't think she's dead.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.444
Then where'd she go?

41:19.560 --> 41:23.315
She looked into the heart of the Tardis.
Even I don't know how strong that is.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.446
And the ship's telepathic,
like I told you, Rose.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.904
Gets inside your head,
translates alien languages.

41:29.904 --> 41:33.659
Maybe the raw energy can translate
all sorts of thoughts.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.833
- Here she is.
- She's an egg?

41:41.916 --> 41:44.840
- Regressed to her childhood.
- She's an egg?

41:45.044 --> 41:47.513
She can start again.
Live her life from scratch.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.682
If we take her home,
give her to a different family,

41:49.799 --> 41:52.302
tell them to bring her up properly,
she might be all right.

41:52.385 --> 41:54.433
- Or she might be worse.
- That's her choice.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.765
- She's an egg.
- She's an egg.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.109
Oh, my God, Mickey.

42:52.820 --> 42:56.415
We're all powered up, we can leave.
Opening the rift filled us up with energy.

42:56.532 --> 42:59.411
- We can go. If that's all right.
- Yeah, fine.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.541
- How's Mickey?
- He's okay. He's gone.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.923
Do you want to go and find him? We'll wait.

43:08.127 --> 43:10.425
No need. He deserves better.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.308
Off we go, then.
Always moving on.

43:14.634 --> 43:17.308
Next stop, Rexicoricophalvitorius.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.389
Now, you don't often get to say that.

43:19.472 --> 43:21.474
We'll stop by and pop her in the hatchery.

43:21.557 --> 43:25.653
Margaret the Slitheen can live her life again.
A second chance.

43:26.187 --> 43:27.860
That'd be nice.

43:45.039 --> 43:47.087
You got chosen, you're a housemate.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.885
You're in the house,
isn't that brilliant?

43:50.002 --> 43:52.425
Welcome to the Weakest Link.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.637
We are giving you
a brand-new image.

43:55.716 --> 43:58.060
Why? Is there something wrong
with what I'm wearing?

43:59.262 --> 44:01.014
- What was that?
- She's been evicted.

44:03.850 --> 44:04.897
This isn’t just a game.

44:04.976 --> 44:08.150
I need to find the Doctor,
he's here somewhere, he's always here!

44:08.271 --> 44:09.614
There's something else going on.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.903
