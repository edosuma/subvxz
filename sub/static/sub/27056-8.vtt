WEBVTT

00:21.563 --> 00:24.566
Tessia!

00:29.612 --> 00:31.281
Tessia!

00:32.866 --> 00:34.409
Tessia!

00:34.492 --> 00:35.952
My baby.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.122
I can't get to you!

00:39.205 --> 00:40.540
Please! Please!

00:42.625 --> 00:43.877
Fucking do something!

00:46.087 --> 00:47.464
You're wasting your time!

00:48.757 --> 00:50.258
Open the fucking door!

00:50.341 --> 00:51.342
Rowan! No!

00:51.426 --> 00:53.386
-Open the fucking door!
-I can't!

00:57.557 --> 00:58.808
We might be infected.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.685
Please.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.271
Please.

01:08.526 --> 01:09.527
Okay.

01:11.946 --> 01:12.864
Please.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.953
Sir,

02:00.036 --> 02:02.330
the infection from the baby
seems to be airborne.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.166
Yes, I know.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.545
We can't let the ship become infected.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.672
I know, Tobis. We all know.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.011
I love you.

02:19.931 --> 02:20.932
I love you.

02:25.603 --> 02:26.688
How did this happen?

02:29.482 --> 02:32.152
-This is an attack on us, on this ship!
-We don't know that.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.655
We do know! My fucking child
just dissolved into a cloud of spores!

02:35.738 --> 02:38.908
That's why we need to study it
and find a solution before it spreads.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.621
We can use our medical systems
to analyze the spores and create a serum.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.749
We'll work together.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.918
All of our resources at once,
that's why we're here.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.090
We'll link the systems from in here,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.467
to send data samples.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.637
I'll get our equipment from the lab,
everything we've got.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.015
We'll set up in here.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.851
-Well, we'll get you out of there.
-I know you will, Row.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.229
So, we need to get started.

03:09.063 --> 03:11.274
I need the spectrometer,

03:11.357 --> 03:13.568
-and both readers, and the RNA modules.
-Got it.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.570
And find Lommie. I need her help

03:15.653 --> 03:17.864
-to integrate our systems.
-Okay.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.115
We're going to solve this.

03:19.198 --> 03:21.618
-We'll get them out of there.
-Thank you. Thank you. Go! Hurry.

03:27.790 --> 03:28.958
Sweetheart?

03:29.626 --> 03:30.501
Sweetheart?

03:31.669 --> 03:33.046
We need a cell sample.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.050
We...

03:39.302 --> 03:40.428
We need it from...

03:45.725 --> 03:46.643
I'll do it.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.480
Thank you.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.444
Have your systems
break down the contaminant.

03:56.527 --> 03:59.113
I will analyze and get set up out here

03:59.197 --> 04:01.157
to try and construct an antidote.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.041
We're well within the range
of our scanners.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.335
We should be picking up
visual data any minute.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.796
But there's something else.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.927
I think our proximity to the Volcryn
is affecting Thale.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.096
He's getting far more powerful.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.514
And I think it's hurting him.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.393
Have you been observing Agatha?

05:14.522 --> 05:15.356
You should.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.112
She's an L?

05:21.738 --> 05:22.697
L-3.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.242
But she's getting stronger
as we're approaching, so...

05:27.285 --> 05:28.328
Almost L-2.

05:32.623 --> 05:33.833
How long have you known?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.962
On some level, I've always known...

05:41.758 --> 05:42.717
The wavelengths.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.887
You predicted that the energy
coming off the Volcryn

05:45.970 --> 05:48.306
-would match that of L telepaths.
-Teke.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.432
You were right.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.978
And we're right in the middle of it.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.941
A billion times what comes off Thale.

05:59.025 --> 05:59.942
Or more.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.903
The material of the probe,

06:02.570 --> 06:04.238
this is why the sphere's working.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.239
Teke...

06:11.746 --> 06:13.414
Did you see something in there?

06:15.416 --> 06:16.501
I saw my daughter.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.128
Mel, she came back.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.258
No, Karl, those are memories,
that is not some message

06:24.342 --> 06:26.094
-from the Volcryn.
-No, Mel, it's different.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.429
This Skye never got sick.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.181
This one never died.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.059
Look, we know that the Volcryn have
the ability to manipulate time,

06:33.142 --> 06:34.352
space, matter.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.978
And what if they're implanting
those images?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.106
Changing you like they changed the probe?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.691
-We need that gear to fight the spores.
-No, I can't. I won't. I can't!

06:40.775 --> 06:42.026
Our friends are dying!

06:43.152 --> 06:45.113
And if they die,
the mission dies with them.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.198
-No, I can't.
-I'm not asking you, Karl.

06:47.281 --> 06:50.159
Get that gear and get it to the lab,
or I'll do it for you.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.112
Skye.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.240
Baby.

08:53.282 --> 08:54.158
It's Daddy.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.626
-Go away.
-Lommie, I'm coming in there.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.711
You can open the door,
or I can get a pulse rifle

09:05.795 --> 09:06.921
and open it for you.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.298
Open.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.349
-What?

09:18.432 --> 09:19.308
What's wrong?

09:26.774 --> 09:28.776
Rowan and Tessia lost their baby.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.490
We need you in the Med Lab
to help link the systems.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.410
What happened?

09:42.707 --> 09:43.791
We don't know.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.512
Lommie, if you know something...

10:01.475 --> 10:02.602
No, I...

10:05.688 --> 10:06.731
Henry Eris.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.109
Cynthia Eris' father, he was, um.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.112
A horrible man.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.281
Abusive.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.534
That's how I...

10:19.285 --> 10:21.579
I took her power away in the Crystal.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.913
That's how I locked her up.

10:24.874 --> 10:25.708
Well, not...

10:28.836 --> 10:30.046
...not all of her.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.091
Cynthia was fragmented

10:34.175 --> 10:36.385
and there was one part of her,
a little girl...

10:40.056 --> 10:42.058
After everything I've been through,
all the abuse.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.768
I couldn't put a kid in there.

10:44.852 --> 10:48.439
So, I left her free in Greywing Manor.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.733
Behind the firewalls.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.068
When I found you there,

10:53.027 --> 10:54.153
you said you made a big mistake.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.863
That was her

10:57.907 --> 10:58.783
I thought

10:59.575 --> 11:01.160
she was the innocent part of Cynthia.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.873
Now I'm wondering
if there is such a thing.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.463
Didn't know you had experience
in the medical field.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.806
I grew up in my mother's lab.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.184
All my teachers were renowned scientists.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.560
That was my school.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.604
My passion.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.456
Structure analysis
should be coming through.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.217
You're set.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.053
The goggles are connected
to the monitor.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.139
Thanks, Lommie.

12:09.854 --> 12:10.855
What?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.401
Nothing.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.989
I just...

12:23.367 --> 12:26.287
I'm sorry, Rowan.

12:32.001 --> 12:32.960
Sorry?

12:33.836 --> 12:34.962
Sorry for what?

12:36.255 --> 12:37.548
You know who did this?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.885
Tell me! You can tell me.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.472
It was fucking Cynthia, was it?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.557
Row, look at the feed.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.750
Shit.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.172
-What is it?
-It's like some black mold.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.383
It's everywhere.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.262
I've never seen anything like it.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.603
Well, we know how molds work.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.239
The baby...

13:44.365 --> 13:45.616
Did she suffer?

13:50.412 --> 13:53.082
So, the collapse...

13:55.042 --> 13:56.377
That was germination.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.131
And the start of a new growth cycle.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.763
Run a scan on everyone's lungs.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.725
That's the first place
that airborne spores aggregate.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.898
Keep the thruster steady, please.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.910
I heard what happened.

15:52.993 --> 15:53.994
He's down?

15:54.578 --> 15:56.497
He's stable in the Med Lab now, but...

15:57.456 --> 15:59.875
he's not the only one I'm concerned about.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.502
That was just one person.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.920
My crew are prepared for anything.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.756
I don't think any of us are prepared
for what's happening.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.512
I need to know what happens
if Roy doesn't make it.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.764
Is this coming from D'Branin?

16:13.847 --> 16:15.641
-He's worried about his mission?
-No.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.185
I am.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.188
If Captain Eris wants to make contact,

16:21.271 --> 16:24.233
it's my duty to complete that mission.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.068
With or without him.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.917
Oh, man.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.177
Okay, you need to lie down.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.513
Okay. Steady.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.439
Look at me.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.524
Okay.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.525
Look at me.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.696
That's it.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.031
That's it, look at the synth.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.699
I'm sending you something now.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.576
-Well, what is it?
-An antidote!

17:18.704 --> 17:19.788
Here it comes!

17:25.669 --> 17:27.046
She's getting worse.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.089
We should test it first.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.425
Culture a spore sample, expose the colony.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.509
We don't have time.

17:33.886 --> 17:34.887
Look here.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.514
Relax.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.104
Okay.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.189
Okay.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.567
I'll run a scan on her.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.453
What about you?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.330
How are you holding up?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.250
I suppose I should be weeping or wailing.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.796
Isn't that what mothers usually do
when they lose a child?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.130
We'll do that later,

18:12.049 --> 18:13.550
once we get you out of here.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.471
Remember when we first met?

18:19.515 --> 18:21.725
I figured you just flew in with the bees.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.646
I never understood
why you chose to show yourself

18:25.729 --> 18:27.314
as a projection for all those years.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.485
Kind of sad for everyone who never got
to know you as a real person.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.211
Door open.

18:52.798 --> 18:53.799
Agatha.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.051
The sound.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.511
I can't make it stop.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.389
-What sound?
-It's like a scratching.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.642
Like something trying
to bore into my skull.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.020
How long has it been this bad?

19:07.771 --> 19:09.481
Ever since the baby came,

19:10.107 --> 19:11.316
it seems to be worse.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.819
It keeps getting louder.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.864
-What about Thale?
-It's worse for him.

19:16.947 --> 19:20.784
Every time we get near each other,
it's like a psychic feedback loop.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.620
That's... it's agonizing.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.621
It's the Volcryn.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.958
We're getting closer to them.
And the Teke energy they're giving off,

19:28.041 --> 19:29.543
it's affecting things.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.337
Karl predicted that
the waveforms would be similar.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.971
The Volcryn are a reservoir
of Teke energy.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.432
More than we ever imagined
could have been possible.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.104
Agatha.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.150
I need you to talk to Thale.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.527
Find out what he's getting from them.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.906
If I get too close to him,

19:58.989 --> 20:01.742
-it could very dangerous for both of us.
-I know.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.828
I know. And I'm sorry.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.039
But we need to find out
what we're flying into,

20:07.122 --> 20:10.000
and he's the first one who could know.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.340
Okay.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.260
I'll try.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.650
They're shrinking.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.152
You did it.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.371
Row, something doesn't feel right.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.667
The spores are dormant,
but they're not receding.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.001
Give it time.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.461
It's not that. I...

20:55.837 --> 20:57.965
I think it might be a cycle of gestation.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.593
No, that's too fast.
The spores can't bloom again this quick.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.640
Tobis?

21:09.142 --> 21:10.310
Help.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.399
Get back!

21:15.482 --> 21:16.900
Get back, don't breathe!

21:49.266 --> 21:50.809
I know you're alive in the ship.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.813
I know you can hear me.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.442
Why won't you speak?

21:59.943 --> 22:01.111
Please, Cyn.

22:01.903 --> 22:02.863
Talk to me.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.036
Roy can't come between us anymore.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.873
I have control of the ship.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.585
Find a way back to me,

22:17.544 --> 22:21.298
and I can return the Flyer
to your capable hands.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.302
You came to play with me?

23:53.473 --> 23:55.016
You took my family away.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.312
-They didn't mean anything to you.
-But you did.

24:00.897 --> 24:02.190
What else did you do?

24:07.779 --> 24:09.614
Have you been hurting my friends?

24:30.177 --> 24:31.845
I gave you this whole house.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.140
I let you be free.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.602
Why take them away from me?

24:40.061 --> 24:41.688
Because I need you.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.194
And I wanted to play.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.621
Cynthia.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.043
Come out.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.004
I like it
when you're scared.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.464
This isn't a game.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.306
Cynthia!

25:21.478 --> 25:22.771
I won't let you die.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.232
I have plans for us.

25:43.792 --> 25:44.876
Single organism.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.381
Sweetheart.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.341
Honey! Honey.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.304
I'm okay.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.391
It comes in waves.

26:03.311 --> 26:04.396
No, you're not.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.191
-You're not okay.
-Row.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.319
I need you to stay strong.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.155
Okay? We'll get out of this.

26:16.157 --> 26:19.327
God, your sad eyes are going to kill me
before these spores.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.581
I just need the spectrometer.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.711
Where the fuck is D'Branin?

26:27.794 --> 26:29.087
I'll go see what's keeping him.

26:45.562 --> 26:48.064
Roy, I need your help.

27:03.621 --> 27:05.498
Intercom volume, zero.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.294
What if...

27:10.628 --> 27:11.880
he can't solve this?

27:13.465 --> 27:14.758
Let him keep trying.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.428
If he doesn't,
he'll never forgive himself.

27:20.388 --> 27:24.434
If the spores make it out into the ship,
everyone dies.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.064
You have to be ready.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.025
For what?

27:33.860 --> 27:35.695
The decontamination cycle.

27:39.074 --> 27:42.577
That would kill every living organism
in this room.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.206
I know.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.423
Skye.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.843
Skye?

28:03.765 --> 28:04.849
Skye?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.311
Skye?

28:13.483 --> 28:14.692
Skye, you still here?

28:15.527 --> 28:16.569
Daddy.

28:18.863 --> 28:19.989
You came back.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.410
Yeah, baby.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.578
I told you I would.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.879
Skye, I need to understand where you are.

28:36.631 --> 28:37.757
I'm here.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.384
With you.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.428
No, baby, I mean,

28:41.511 --> 28:42.929
when you're not in this place.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.265
Where do you go?

28:46.015 --> 28:47.726
I'm at our house. With Mommy.

28:50.603 --> 28:51.813
Okay, good.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.107
Is Mommy happy?

28:55.692 --> 28:58.570
Yes, but she misses you.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.077
Skye,

29:07.662 --> 29:10.123
when I left on the Nightflyer,

29:12.959 --> 29:14.335
do you remember what happened that day?

29:16.379 --> 29:18.339
Huh, of course, I remember.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.594
We all went to the launch,
my whole school.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.555
And you were on the news feeds that night.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.938
-Daddy.
-It's really you.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.607
Daddy, is something wrong?

29:38.485 --> 29:40.862
No. No, baby.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.864
No, nothing's wrong. You're perfect.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.202
Can you take my hand?

29:56.586 --> 29:58.129
I can touch you, you're real.

30:02.884 --> 30:06.721
Oh. Oh, Skye, I'm never going
to let you go again.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.557
I'm never going to lose you again.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.185
-Daddy?
-Yeah.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.313
I can't...

30:16.189 --> 30:17.190
hold on.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.775
No, Skye.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.235
No, hold on. Don't let go.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.654
-I'm trying, Daddy, but...
-Please, Skye, try...

30:22.737 --> 30:24.072
I'm really trying...

30:25.490 --> 30:26.741
Skye!

30:44.259 --> 30:45.385
Mel, stop!

30:46.469 --> 30:48.680
-I said stop!
-Rowan's been waiting for you!

30:48.763 --> 30:49.681
We need this equipment!

30:49.764 --> 30:51.349
This machine, everything I've built,

30:51.432 --> 30:55.353
this, here,
is everything that I came out here for.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.438
And it's working.

30:58.439 --> 31:01.568
I've been using it
to speak with my daughter.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.194
You don't even know if that's real

31:03.903 --> 31:05.405
or just some visual garbage

31:05.488 --> 31:07.615
that the memory sphere's
pulling out of your head.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.367
No, it's more than that.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.535
I touched her hand.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.913
Real physical contact.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.374
Karl, it's not her.

31:17.625 --> 31:18.710
Skye is dead.

31:20.086 --> 31:23.381
And our team is dying right now
in this world.

31:24.757 --> 31:27.093
Not in some alternate reality.

31:27.176 --> 31:29.137
Not in some Volcryn fantasy!

31:30.221 --> 31:31.222
Right now!

31:33.933 --> 31:34.976
And they need you.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.064
I need you.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.651
Mm-mm-mm.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.903
Look what the cat dragged in.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.657
You did very good.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.717
Now, taste my hell!

32:50.468 --> 32:53.096
Can't wait to kiss
that girlfriend of yours.

32:53.179 --> 32:54.931
-No.
-I'll tell her you said hi.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.312
No! Don't leave me here!

33:02.188 --> 33:04.232
-Don't leave me here!
-Cynthia!

33:04.315 --> 33:05.650
Don't leave me here!

33:37.306 --> 33:38.391
Thale?

33:46.941 --> 33:48.192
Thale!

34:00.830 --> 34:01.914
Listen...

34:07.712 --> 34:08.838
Agatha?

34:11.966 --> 34:14.343
Agatha! Are you up here?

34:16.804 --> 34:18.514
-Hey, hey.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.849
Oh, my god.

34:19.932 --> 34:21.517
You're amplifying each other.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.478
You can't be this close,
you're killing each other.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.356
I can't make it stop!

34:29.442 --> 34:31.694
They're breaking into our visual spectrum.

34:31.778 --> 34:33.321
Tessia, look at me.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.989
It's going to be fine, I promise you.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.491
-Please stay with me.
-Tessia!

34:36.574 --> 34:37.992
-She can't talk!
-Hey, hey.

34:39.035 --> 34:41.579
-Where have you been? So does Tessia!
-Agatha needs help.

34:41.662 --> 34:44.332
-Where the fuck have you been?
-Agatha needs help. Help me suppress--

34:44.415 --> 34:45.958
-What's going on--

35:04.560 --> 35:05.728
This is it.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.067
This is the sound.

35:13.027 --> 35:16.197
-What sound?
-They're trying to eat through the glass.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.081
She's going.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.710
They're blooming inside of her.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.716
They're going to chew their way out.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.404
She's trying to say something.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.200
"Row?"

36:03.578 --> 36:04.745
"Rowan."

36:07.206 --> 36:08.708
Yes, darling?

36:08.791 --> 36:10.543
"Don't let it poison your heart."

36:12.378 --> 36:13.588
"Remember love,

36:14.547 --> 36:16.257
how happy we made each other."

36:18.342 --> 36:19.844
"Live in that place."

36:38.362 --> 36:39.363
What?

36:40.531 --> 36:41.699
What is she saying? Tell me!

36:42.700 --> 36:44.118
She wants you to do it now.

36:44.577 --> 36:45.578
Do what?

36:47.872 --> 36:49.373
Do what now, Agatha?

36:52.752 --> 36:55.004
-They're breaking through the glass!
-What?

36:55.087 --> 36:56.255
She wants you to do it now!

36:56.339 --> 36:57.840
-Do what?
-Look, I don't understand!

36:57.924 --> 36:59.800
-You have to do it now!
-Do what now?

36:59.884 --> 37:02.011
They're going
to break through the glass!

37:02.720 --> 37:05.097
-This is Captain Roy Eris.
-Identity confirmed.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.683
-Initiate decontamination sequence.
-Don't you fucking dare!

37:07.767 --> 37:08.976
Don't press! No!

37:09.060 --> 37:10.478
-Press the button.
-Don't!

37:10.561 --> 37:12.021
-Now!
-No!

37:12.104 --> 37:14.398
-Decontamination initiated.
-No! Tessia!

37:14.482 --> 37:15.650
Warning.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.945
Tessia!

37:19.946 --> 37:21.530
Tessia!

37:34.585 --> 37:36.254
Decontamination complete.

37:40.424 --> 37:43.427
Room purged. No organics detected.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.846
Decontamination complete.

39:18.314 --> 39:20.524
Auggie, I need your help.

39:20.608 --> 39:21.692
Deactivate.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.904
Roy, where are you?

39:27.323 --> 39:28.824
The medical lab is sterile.

39:29.784 --> 39:30.743
The others?

39:31.619 --> 39:32.745
They're gone.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.414
Tessia and Tobis.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.834
I'm on my way, sir.
