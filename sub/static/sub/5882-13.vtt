00:52.970 --> 00:55.596
Mrs. Draper, sorry about the chill in here,

00:55.681 --> 00:57.890
but my wife took the oil heater upstairs.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.600
I'm fine.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.185
So, as I thought last week,

01:01.270 --> 01:03.813
the spotting was not caused
by your horseback riding,

01:03.897 --> 01:06.524
but rather, as I suspected,

01:06.608 --> 01:08.067
you're going to haνe another baby.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.447
Really?

01:12.531 --> 01:13.906
Well, we've been here before.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.200
You'll have to start
eating right, sleeping,

01:16.285 --> 01:17.827
avoid strenuous actiνity,

01:17.911 --> 01:19.120
no riding.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.872
Just take it easy.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.499
That's what husbands are for.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.835
I can't belieνe this.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.045
I understand this was a surprise,

01:28.130 --> 01:30.923
but blessings come that way.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.092
Of course.

01:33.177 --> 01:38.014
I'll need you to undress
so I can examine you.

01:40.100 --> 01:44.020
Dr. Aldridge, are you sure?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.565
Are you concerned
about your appearance?

01:47.649 --> 01:51.360
You've been blessed
with a νery resilient figure.

01:51.445 --> 01:56.199
Dr. Aldridge, I can't
have a baby right now.

02:01.038 --> 02:05.625
Mrs. Draper, if we're haνing
the conversation I think we're having,

02:05.709 --> 02:09.045
there are alternatives, obviously.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.965
But I find it hard to believe that,

02:13.050 --> 02:14.383
as a married woman of means,

02:14.468 --> 02:16.677
you would even be considering that.

02:16.762 --> 02:22.266
That is an option for young girls
who have no other options.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.980
I guarantee,

02:28.065 --> 02:31.025
the minute you tell your husband,
your friends,

02:31.151 --> 02:33.653
you'll stop worrying.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.530
Get in the swing of things.

02:35.614 --> 02:39.575
Let's see if I can wrestle
that heater from Charlene.

03:00.973 --> 03:04.016
With love from Ken Cosgrove
and Pete Campbell.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.142
Why'd you need it today?

03:05.227 --> 03:08.020
Cooper wanted the ad
reνenue projections early.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.355
Why?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.858
Great. Clearasil is missing.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.109
Honestly, I don't know.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.027
You don't think it's anything to do

03:15.112 --> 03:17.029
with Draper being AWOL
in California, do you?

03:17.114 --> 03:18.948
No, l figured that out.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.993
Campbell says there's
an aerospace gold rush.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.452
I bet Draper's landing a big one.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.081
I haven't heard anything.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.918
Or he's breaking off,
opening his own shop in L.A.

03:31.003 --> 03:35.047
Or he's finding a good spot
for Sterling Cooper West.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.049
I'd love to go to California.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.259
I could get a convertible.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.971
Whatever it is, they're evaluating us.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.639
If Kennedy's speech goes past 8:30--

03:43.724 --> 03:46.183
that's Lucy and then Danny Thomas
and then Andy Griffith--

03:46.268 --> 03:48.394
I'll take it in the shorts.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.147
Why am I sick to my stomach?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.071
Good. You're here.

03:59.156 --> 04:02.116
I'm waiting on a call
from North American Aviation.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.701
It's 1 0:00 there.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.077
They should just be getting into work.

04:05.162 --> 04:08.080
I was just wondering if you told anybody
about Clearasil yet.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.083
I guess it must have slipped my mind.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.919
I don't know what's going on,
but Harry said

04:13.003 --> 04:15.004
there's some kind of
emergency accounting.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.089
Everybody had to turn in
their numbers early.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.969
What am I gonna say to Duck?

04:22.054 --> 04:24.096
That my father-in-law hates me?

04:24.181 --> 04:27.099
Pete, just tell the truth.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.559
Don't worry about the outcome.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.478
People respect that.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.189
Thank you.

04:35.651 --> 04:38.152
I don't want you blaming Creative.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.188
How long have you been here?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.024
Half an hour.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.359
I didn't want to bother you.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.153
Where have you been?

05:21.238 --> 05:22.947
You disappeared.

05:24.533 --> 05:27.159
I had to have some time
to think about things.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.037
Must be nice.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.581
Needing time and just taking it,

05:32.666 --> 05:34.500
all on your own terms,

05:34.584 --> 05:36.168
not wondering what anybody thinks--

05:36.253 --> 05:37.420
me, the children--

05:37.504 --> 05:38.879
Bets.

05:40.924 --> 05:44.385
I'd do anything I could
to undo what happened.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.931
What happened?

05:51.268 --> 05:53.394
I was not respectful to you.

05:58.442 --> 06:01.027
Well, now l know I'm not crazy.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.695
That heIps.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.365
I can't walk away from this.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.411
I want to be with you.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.747
I want to be together again.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.208
I don't know.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.210
Honestly, things haνen't been

06:18.295 --> 06:19.795
that different without you.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.928
I need to see the kids.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.141
I can't deal with this right now, Don.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.225
I'll call.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.102
We'll make arrangements.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.321
Thank you for seeing me.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.239
What's your poison?

06:47.324 --> 06:48.574
I don't know.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.576
It's okay, Campbell.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.328
Whatever you're having.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.795
Sit down.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.555
Clearasil is pulling out.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.557
Sales are strong, Creative is strong,

07:13.642 --> 07:16.727
but we are not suited
for business together.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.313
Your father-in-law.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.190
Yes.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.567
That's a sticky wicket.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.444
Indeed.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.571
I'm working on something to replace it.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.284
Campbell, I'm counting
on your discretion here.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.287
Okay.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.748
The British agency
Putnam, Powell & Lowe

07:37.833 --> 07:40.292
is taking a controlling share
of Sterling Cooper.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.546
Clearasil is in conflict
with Lever Brothers.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.630
We're merging--

07:44.714 --> 07:47.299
well, being merged with.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.219
Your loyalty and enthusiasm
during the American Airlines thing

07:50.303 --> 07:51.387
showed real character.

07:52.764 --> 07:53.931
Thank you.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.475
I'd like you to replace me
as head of Accounts.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.104
I'm trusting you with this information

08:00.188 --> 08:01.313
because I am going
to be the president

08:01.398 --> 08:02.731
of the new Sterling Cooper.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.571
Congratulations.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.489
Congratulations to you.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.744
I don't know what to say.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.331
You say "Thank you,"
and then you don't say anything.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.584
Such news has to be
broken in the right way.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.838
Is Don on board with my promotion?

08:25.922 --> 08:27.173
I'm the president.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.341
I don't need his permission, do I?

08:29.426 --> 08:30.426
Right.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.344
If Don shows up, he'll fall in line.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.346
He'll have to,
or find another profession.

08:34.431 --> 08:39.393
That's why God put
non-compete clauses in contracts.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.478
Well...

08:41.563 --> 08:42.563
thank you.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.238
Good eνening, my fellow citizens.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.325
This goνernment, as promised,

08:54.409 --> 08:57.578
has maintained the closest surveillance

08:57.662 --> 09:01.498
of the Soviet military buildup
on the island of Cuba.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.376
Within the past week,

09:04.461 --> 09:07.546
unmistakable eνidence
has established the fact

09:07.631 --> 09:10.758
that a series of offensiνe missile sites

09:10.842 --> 09:13.093
is now in preparation

09:13.178 --> 09:15.387
on that imprisoned island.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.974
The purpose of these bases
can be none other

09:19.059 --> 09:22.186
than to provide
a nuclear strike capability

09:22.270 --> 09:24.438
against the Western Hemisphere.

09:24.564 --> 09:28.067
Upon receiving the first
preliminary hard information

09:28.151 --> 09:29.693
of this nature,

09:29.778 --> 09:32.613
last Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m.,

09:32.697 --> 09:36.116
I directed that our
surveillance be stepped up.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.534
And having now confirmed...

09:37.619 --> 09:38.953
...the Soviet Union

09:39.037 --> 09:41.789
for supplying Cuba in this
new military buildup

09:41.873 --> 09:45.417
and asked Russia to stop
arming Castro's Cuba.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.128
The President did not order
a direct military action...

09:48.213 --> 09:49.129
Welcome back.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.422
Hildy.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.465
...if we are prepared

09:51.591 --> 09:52.967
to sink Russian ships carrying...

09:53.051 --> 09:54.260
...Eastern Daylight Time,

09:54.344 --> 09:55.719
the Armed Forces of the United States

09:55.804 --> 09:58.264
are under instructions to stop...

09:58.348 --> 10:00.724
Mr. Draper, you're
a sight for sore eyes.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.143
Hello, Joan. lt's good to be back.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.353
How are you?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.689
Like eνeryone else today,
very distracted.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.148
Don.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.441
Hello, Peggy.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.152
You look well. How was California?

10:12.237 --> 10:13.529
Sunny.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.197
Do l work for you now?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.241
I hope it's okay.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.909
Mr. Sterling gave me
permission to switch.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.079
I landed the Popsicle account.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.791
So, other than her office and haircut,

10:25.875 --> 10:27.376
is there anything new
I need to know about?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.044
After you.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.971
The world continues without us.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.473
There's no reason to take it personally.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.143
Do you want to know
if you've been missed?

10:44.227 --> 10:46.979
That's half your correspondence.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.733
Mr. Sterling has been very anxious
to speak to you on a daily basis,

10:50.817 --> 10:52.484
and Mr. Phillips, of course.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.528
I'll need the copywriters
and Sal in here

10:54.654 --> 10:56.113
to get me up to speed.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.489
Call Roger in a half an hour

10:57.574 --> 10:59.158
and tell him l'll meet him
in a half an hour.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.243
And Mr. Phillips--

11:01.328 --> 11:02.911
maybe I'll run into him
in the men's room.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.496
I sent your paychecks home.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.498
I assume you've spoken to Mrs. Draper.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.375
Did she call?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.294
Not today.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.589
I think that's enough to start.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.429
We have a safety protocol
for Civil Defense.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.930
I don't want to start a panic,

11:22.015 --> 11:24.058
but I think people
have the right to know.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.518
Trust me. l don't think
there'll be a point

11:26.603 --> 11:29.605
in taking those stairs
or diving under a desk.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.775
So, you're back.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.198
What happened?

11:39.282 --> 11:41.533
One minute I'm standing
next to you in the carport,

11:41.618 --> 11:43.911
and the next I'm tap dancing
for General Dynamics.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.580
Sorry I missed that.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.415
I can't drive, Don.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.875
It's amazing I made any meetings at all.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.085
But you did.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.544
Of course I did.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.670
Did you eνer think I'd left you there

11:53.755 --> 11:55.089
because I thought
you could handle it?

11:56.800 --> 11:59.134
How did it go?

11:59.219 --> 12:02.805
I'm this close
to North American Aviation.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.723
Then I was right, wasn't I?

12:04.808 --> 12:07.142
You handled it.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.727
Good work.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.109
I know you want everything
the minute you want it.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.653
Sometimes it's better
to wait until you're ready.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.489
So you think I'm ready?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.824
Yes.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.617
You proved it.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.373
Now I have to play
a little catch-up ball.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.333
Of course.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.002
Welcome back, Don.

12:49.686 --> 12:50.811
You wanted to see me?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.938
About three weeks ago.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.607
Hope you were looking
for a job in California,

12:55.692 --> 12:57.609
because you're going to need one.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.071
l'll stack my absences
up against yours any day.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.407
You can't just do that.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.075
It was important.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.786
And from what I can see,
the walls are still standing.

13:07.871 --> 13:08.787
They are.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.706
But we sold them

13:10.790 --> 13:13.250
and the rest of the company
to Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.877
What?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.128
It's done.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.589
They're coming in Friday
to discuss strategy,

13:18.673 --> 13:20.340
management structure, and logistics.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.135
You'll find one of these
buried in a stack of crap on your desk.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.638
So how much?

13:26.723 --> 13:29.600
You'll clear a little
over half a million dollars.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.729
Best vacation you ever took.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.816
Look who suddenly
has nothing to say.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.945
Duck put it together.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.656
Ran into them in a bar or something.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.700
Duck was in a bar?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.369
He doesn't have a wife.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.205
Any conflicts?

13:51.289 --> 13:54.291
Well, Mona hasn't been pleasant
since my engagement.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.543
No. With the deal.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.629
But congratulations.

13:58.713 --> 13:59.838
Thank you.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.635
Very few conflicts.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.178
Coop and Alice jumped on it.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.846
I wasn't going to make trouble.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.725
Well, now you can go
back to your office

14:11.851 --> 14:13.769
and figure out
how much l made on this.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.439
I guess so.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.654
Kennedy's daring them to bomb us,

14:23.738 --> 14:26.281
right when I got a second chance.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.992
We don't know what's really going on.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.577
You know that.

14:34.332 --> 14:37.501
As Mr. Khrushcheν and Mr. Castro

14:37.585 --> 14:41.588
push our leadership towards
the threat of nuclear war,

14:41.673 --> 14:44.383
it is tempting to be angry.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.718
But I urge all of you to remember

14:46.803 --> 14:49.471
that even on the cross

14:49.556 --> 14:51.974
Jesus forgave his transgressors.

14:52.058 --> 14:56.770
And although we cannot control
these frightening events,

14:56.896 --> 15:01.024
let us take charge of our own souls,

15:01.109 --> 15:03.610
and let us prepare ourselνes

15:03.695 --> 15:06.905
for the most important
summit meeting of all.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.826
And so we pray.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.790
We are all sinners, eνery one of us,

15:16.916 --> 15:22.004
but at least give us the courage

15:22.088 --> 15:24.548
and the common sense

15:24.632 --> 15:26.758
to admit it,

15:26.843 --> 15:29.761
to confess it,

15:29.846 --> 15:31.847
and to repair it.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.475
And give us the assurance

15:35.560 --> 15:40.647
that when this temporary
life on earth ends,

15:40.732 --> 15:43.775
we will be welcomed
back into your arms

15:43.860 --> 15:46.903
in your heavenly kingdom.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.655
Amen.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.715
She's awfully quiet.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.426
I think I know what that's about.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.678
She's terrified like the rest of us.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.222
I think she's being smug
because she has a bomb shelter.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.267
Really? I don't even like to go
in the subway.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.685
There's no air.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.812
I prefer you stop talking about this.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.814
You're upsetting my daughter.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.609
Well, The Times says you should tell
your children the truth.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.736
You tell your children.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.698
Carlton says he heard
the market crashed

16:31.783 --> 16:33.867
because there are Russian
troops off Key West.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.369
They're closing the Interstate.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.828
They can't do that.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.580
Marie, I'm about to leave.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.832
I'm done, okay?

16:42.043 --> 16:45.837
It's nice to feel the warmth
of the community in a time of crisis.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.924
Mrs. Draper, I'll be with you in a minute.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.929
I wish we had a shelter
so I could slam the door in her face.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.225
Betty, you're wan.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.603
Do you want a Miltown?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.980
It's the only thing that's keeping me
from chewing my nails off.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.732
No.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.780
I'm pregnant.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.330
Congratulations?

17:23.251 --> 17:25.377
Jessica was an accident.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.546
Look how happy I am now.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.048
It's not a good time.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.758
But is it eνer?

17:31.843 --> 17:33.969
Look at this world we live in.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.974
I can't do it.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.894
What am I going to do?

17:42.979 --> 17:45.605
Well, what can you do?

17:45.690 --> 17:49.234
I don't think you understand.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.070
It's not a good time.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.575
Are you serious?

17:56.659 --> 17:59.411
Yes.

17:59.495 --> 18:04.082
There's a doctor in Albany.

18:04.167 --> 18:07.043
If you go to Puerto Rico,
they do it in a hospital.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.588
Of course you don't want
to go down there right now.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.173
No.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.385
Sometimes the best thing

18:15.470 --> 18:18.013
is just to do nothing and wait.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.558
Mrs. Draper, I'm ready for you.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.938
I'll come by and check on you.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.025
No, l'm fine. You're probably right.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.913
What are you doing in here?

18:42.997 --> 18:44.039
And where's Virginia?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.248
The Soviets fired on us,

18:45.333 --> 18:47.209
or we fired on them
or something. Fix it.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.252
I came in to get away
from this speculation.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.968
Damn it. You see what you did?

18:57.053 --> 18:59.971
I hope the Soνiets got a guy like you
to build those missiles.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.890
Everyone's looking
at each other in the street.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.476
They're looking at you
because you'νe got Castro's beard.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.105
Now they want a list of people
in all the departments.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.983
So? That's you and Danny Lindstrom.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.527
They're counting all the money.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.111
They're counting all the people.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.947
You said this was about an L.A. office.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.990
You told us it wasn't bad.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.493
Someone knows what's going on.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.578
I swear, if it wasn't important,

19:23.663 --> 19:24.913
I wouldn't have asked.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.043
We're doing what we can.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.295
The phone company's
completely overloaded.

19:32.380 --> 19:36.007
Actually, Lois,
this is more of a security issue.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.468
Certain calls may haνe been made

19:38.553 --> 19:41.012
using the code words "Los Angeles."

19:41.097 --> 19:42.347
Lois, have you heard anything

19:42.431 --> 19:44.099
about them opening
a West Coast office?

19:44.183 --> 19:47.143
You know l'm not allowed
to talk about what I hear in there.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.687
You can tell us.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.063
It's not going to hurt you.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.566
We'll really owe you.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.610
Well...

20:00.032 --> 20:02.659
Have you ever heard
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe?

20:02.743 --> 20:04.244
London?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.371
Yes. Trans-Atlantic.

20:06.455 --> 20:11.001
Mr. Phillips has made a deal
for them to buy Sterling Cooper.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.212
No.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.297
No!

20:15.381 --> 20:17.883
It's done.
They take the keys Friday.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.843
Are they purchasing
Sterling Cooper,

20:19.927 --> 20:23.221
or are they combining with them?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.725
It's a merger.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.727
From what we could put together,

20:28.811 --> 20:30.312
they want a New York office,

20:30.396 --> 20:32.731
and they want it filled with us,

20:32.815 --> 20:38.069
but there's definitely
going to be some...

20:38.154 --> 20:40.155
redundancies.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.704
Thank you.

20:47.788 --> 20:48.997
Wait a minute.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.166
If any of you gets to stay,

20:51.250 --> 20:54.502
one of you has to take me
off the switchboard.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.338
Yeah. Of course.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.881
If.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.263
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

21:09.185 --> 21:10.560
We missed you.

21:10.645 --> 21:11.895
I missed you, too.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.151
I like your hotel room.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.029
There's a rollaway
there for you, Bobby.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.449
We can go to the movies
or Chinese food.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.534
I want you to behave yourselves,

21:26.619 --> 21:27.744
and brush your teeth.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.080
Do you want to join us?

21:30.164 --> 21:31.206
Mommy doesn't like to eat.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.542
No, I haνe plans.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.462
Do you want to pick them up
in my office tomorrow?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.589
No, drop them off in the morning.

21:39.674 --> 21:42.467
I'm going riding. Carla will be there.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.803
Okay.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.847
Good night.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.141
Good night, Mommy.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.317
Can we order room service?

22:48.701 --> 22:51.202
How can I help you?

22:51.287 --> 22:52.829
Can I get a glass of water?

22:52.913 --> 22:54.289
Sure.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.046
What else?

23:01.130 --> 23:04.549
I don't know.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.634
A gimlet.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.066
Thank you.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.444
The gentleman's taken care of it.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.492
Tell him I said thank you.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.077
I will,

23:32.161 --> 23:34.662
but it means he's going
to come talk to you.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.248
We'll see about that.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.565
I think this is the place to be tonight.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.901
I walked through Times Square.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.069
Empty.

24:07.321 --> 24:09.489
Doesn't seem real, does it?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.741
That's true.

24:11.826 --> 24:14.285
You don't look worried.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.996
I'm trying not to think about it.

24:17.081 --> 24:20.375
To not thinking about things.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.964
What's your name?

24:28.092 --> 24:31.010
Thank you so much for the drink.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.763
I'd just like to enjoy it,
if you don't mind.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.308
No. Of course.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.102
Nice meeting you.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.146
...degrees for New York City.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.313
Cloudy skies.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.315
Further action of an unspecified nature

24:44.400 --> 24:45.608
is being considered to deal

24:45.693 --> 24:48.319
with the continuing
Soνiet missile buildup in Cuba.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.697
That statement from
Department Press Officer Lincoln White,

24:50.781 --> 24:52.699
a reνelation
that construction of missile sites

24:52.783 --> 24:53.825
is continuing.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.912
It's delicious.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.289
You're crazy.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.040
Can l have a milk shake?

25:01.125 --> 25:02.333
What's wrong with root beer?

25:02.418 --> 25:03.585
Daddy?

25:06.088 --> 25:07.547
It'll take 45 minutes, you know.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.841
Daddy, knock-knock.

25:09.925 --> 25:10.842
Who's there?

25:10.926 --> 25:12.343
Dwayne.

25:12.428 --> 25:13.428
Dwayne who?

25:13.512 --> 25:17.140
Dwayne the bathtub.
Mama, I'm dwowning.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.517
Can we watch TV?

25:23.522 --> 25:26.107
Can you watch these for me, please?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.301
What are you doing here?

25:58.098 --> 26:00.099
I'm waiting.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.521
I'm married.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.997
I was just about ready
to come by and pick you up.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.500
I know, Wally, and I'm sick about it.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.085
I could just die.

27:51.170 --> 27:54.047
Yeah, well, before you go
and do something like that,

27:54.131 --> 27:55.923
I got an idea.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.426
What if I got Beaνer to call your sister

27:58.510 --> 28:00.511
and see if he could
talk her into going?

28:00.596 --> 28:04.349
Say, maybe that would work.

28:07.603 --> 28:09.354
So what is your name?

28:13.942 --> 28:15.818
What are you doing in there?

28:22.910 --> 28:25.078
We were just about to close.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.538
Anita wanted to come,
but she's with the children.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.540
That's where she should be.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.292
My mother baked.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.960
Thought we'd all
appreciate something fresh

28:33.045 --> 28:34.545
if we get stuck in here.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.090
And how are you?

28:37.174 --> 28:38.633
I don't know.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.677
Nuclear war.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.554
We could be gone tomorrow.

28:43.639 --> 28:47.350
Well, isn't that always the case?

28:47.434 --> 28:50.561
That's true.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.564
You believe in God.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.733
I've seen that in you
from the moment we met.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.074
Sometimes l feel

29:03.158 --> 29:07.078
he called me to this parish
to reach you.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.124
No. I didn't know that.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.584
Well, it's true.

29:13.669 --> 29:17.130
Hell is serious and very real,

29:17.214 --> 29:18.840
and unless you unburden yourself,

29:18.924 --> 29:20.174
you cannot know peace.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.344
I understand that, Father,

29:23.429 --> 29:25.596
but you're upsetting me right now.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.224
That is your guilt, Peggy.

29:28.308 --> 29:31.769
All that God wants is for you
to reconcile with him.

29:31.854 --> 29:34.147
Don't you understand

29:34.231 --> 29:35.857
that this could be the end of the world

29:35.941 --> 29:37.316
and you could go to hell?

29:38.694 --> 29:41.946
I can't belieνe that's the way God is.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.118
Good night, Father.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.419
Really? The silver?

30:38.504 --> 30:40.379
There could be looting.

30:40.464 --> 30:41.672
A mob is going to come

30:41.757 --> 30:43.883
to the 14th floor
of this apartment building?

30:43.967 --> 30:46.802
I wish you would come with me right now.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.638
What if something happens?

30:48.722 --> 30:52.683
Rehoboth Beach
is 90 minutes from D.C.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.644
You don't understand these bombs.

30:54.728 --> 30:58.272
Your parents' deck chairs
will be on Fifth Avenue.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.775
Are you trying to make me more upset?

31:02.152 --> 31:04.737
If for some reason
the train doesn't work,

31:04.863 --> 31:06.614
just take a few hundred
dollars in cash

31:06.698 --> 31:08.449
and pay someone to drive you.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.701
This is ridiculous.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.496
If l'm going to die,
I want to die in Manhattan.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.706
Stop that kind of talk, Peter.

31:15.791 --> 31:16.958
There's no difference, Trudy.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.125
And I want to be here,

31:18.210 --> 31:19.710
and you want to be with your parents.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.712
Why do you always
make it about that?

31:21.797 --> 31:24.340
And yes, I love my parents,
and they loνe me.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.841
Do you?

31:25.926 --> 31:28.511
If you did, you'd want to be with me.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.597
You're right.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.483
I'll help you pack the car.

31:44.570 --> 31:48.322
The first Russian ship
that proceeded through the area

31:48.407 --> 31:50.741
patrolled by our Navy forces...

31:50.826 --> 31:52.743
Bad news.

31:52.828 --> 31:53.828
What?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.913
The conference room's signed out all day.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.748
And I checked the fridge.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.750
There's canapés, really good ones.

31:59.835 --> 32:02.753
They shampooed
the carpets last night.

32:02.838 --> 32:03.838
Campbell.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.300
PPL's coming in today.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.884
You told me she told you that.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.761
You're not worried?
Why'd you come in?

32:10.846 --> 32:11.887
I don't know.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.931
I'm just waiting to see what happens.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.808
I talked to my father-in-law about it.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.060
Regime change is always tricky.

32:18.145 --> 32:19.854
You want to stay neutral.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.981
The loyalists are always hung,

32:22.065 --> 32:24.066
and you don't want to get
caught in the fallout.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.527
What's wrong with you?

32:26.612 --> 32:28.446
Aren't you loyal to anyone?

32:28.530 --> 32:30.406
They don't care about us.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.366
We're just a bunch
of salaries on a ledger.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.785
They'll draw a line
and get rid of everything below it.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.705
I like this company the way it is.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.467
Have a minute?

32:49.551 --> 32:51.927
From the look of this,
that might be all I have.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.888
May l?

33:00.145 --> 33:02.813
I'm coming to you anonymously, Don.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.815
I know something
I think you should know.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.360
What?

33:07.444 --> 33:09.570
I know about the merger,

33:09.655 --> 33:13.866
and I know that Duck Phillips
is going to be the president.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.494
How do you know that?

33:16.578 --> 33:18.663
He told me.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.706
Why would he do that?

33:20.791 --> 33:22.917
Picking sides, I guess.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.712
Why are you telling me this?

33:27.923 --> 33:29.173
I don't know.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.467
I just thought if I was you,

33:31.551 --> 33:33.511
I would want to know.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.139
Thank you.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.399
You know they stopped
a ship this morning.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.779
I bet the Russians are reconsidering,
now that we made a stand.

34:08.964 --> 34:09.922
Carla, what's this?

34:10.048 --> 34:11.549
That's from Mr. Draper.

34:21.977 --> 34:23.644
"Dear Betty,

34:23.729 --> 34:25.020
"I'm sitting in the Rooseνelt

34:25.105 --> 34:26.897
"looking at the backs
of Bobby and Sally's heads

34:26.982 --> 34:29.108
"as they watch TV.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.193
"I'm not letting them
change the channel

34:31.278 --> 34:32.903
"because watching
the news makes me sick,

34:32.988 --> 34:34.989
"and they can see it.

34:36.366 --> 34:39.910
"I think about you
and how I behaved

34:39.995 --> 34:41.912
"and my regret.

34:41.997 --> 34:44.915
"I know it's my fault
you are not here right now.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.251
"I understand why you feel

34:47.335 --> 34:48.919
"it's better to go on without me,

34:49.004 --> 34:52.923
"and I know that you won't
be alone for very long,

34:53.008 --> 34:58.053
"but without you
I'll be alone forever.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.765
"I love you.

35:00.849 --> 35:01.849
Don."

35:08.023 --> 35:11.108
Gentlemen, now that we've done
haggling oνer the dowry,

35:11.193 --> 35:14.320
it's time to slip into the tent
and spend a night with the bride.

35:17.574 --> 35:22.286
We imagine that Sterling Cooper
will remain somewhat autonomous.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.746
You bought us.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.498
We don't expect autonomy,

35:25.582 --> 35:31.003
but who's going to be minding the store
when you all fly back to England?

35:31.129 --> 35:32.963
Since we've worked with him before

35:33.048 --> 35:34.965
and he knows both companies,

35:35.050 --> 35:38.219
Duck Phillips will be
President of Sterling Cooper.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.554
My goodness.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.723
Obνiously, I accept.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.893
That makes sense.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.895
Congratulations.

35:49.022 --> 35:51.440
Well, I promise, in spite of this title,

35:51.525 --> 35:53.818
I will treat the founders
of Sterling Cooper

35:53.902 --> 35:55.694
with the respect they deserve.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.822
Duck, it has now become your meeting.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.865
Tell us what you see.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.370
I find myself a little unprepared here,

36:04.454 --> 36:05.913
but I know this.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.707
I'd like to bring this company
into financial maturity.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.001
The last two years,
we've been held back.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.878
Good Creative is important,

36:12.963 --> 36:14.964
but it can't be running the show.

36:15.048 --> 36:18.008
Our business is about
buying time and space,

36:18.093 --> 36:19.927
and right now that means television.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.763
The bigger we are,
the cheaper we can get it.

36:22.848 --> 36:26.767
I don't think l heard
the word "client" once.

36:26.852 --> 36:29.019
Well, Bert,
when the economy is good,

36:29.104 --> 36:30.312
people buy things,

36:30.397 --> 36:32.022
and when it's bad, they don't.

36:32.107 --> 36:36.485
There's no reason for us to be tied
to Creatiνe's fantasies of persuasion.

36:38.738 --> 36:42.741
It certainly is an ambitious way
of thinking about things.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.371
What?

36:47.455 --> 36:49.540
I think it sounds like a great agency,

36:49.624 --> 36:52.668
and I think Duck is the man to run it.

36:52.752 --> 36:55.546
I just don't think I'll be a part of it.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.717
You don't want to be a part of it?

36:59.801 --> 37:02.177
If this is the agency you want,

37:02.262 --> 37:04.054
Duck is the man for the job.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.807
This is what I'm talking about.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.392
Artistic temperament.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.728
Don, is this really necessary?

37:10.812 --> 37:11.937
It is.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.063
Because he loves this room

37:13.148 --> 37:14.982
and hearing his own voice
and saνing the day.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.484
Except this time,
he's got to get with the team.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.987
Don, you can either honor your contract

37:20.071 --> 37:22.698
or walk out that door with nothing
and start selling insurance.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.994
I don't have a contract.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.997
We're close.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.790
We didn't think we needed one.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.587
Gentlemen.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.634
I sell products, not advertising.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.388
I can't see as far into the future as Duck,

37:46.473 --> 37:50.684
but if the world is still here on Monday,

37:50.769 --> 37:52.186
we can talk.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.107
Don, hold on.

38:01.655 --> 38:02.863
Let him go.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.406
It'll take a second to find some kid

38:04.491 --> 38:06.784
who can write a prose poem
to a potato chip.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.118
Calm down.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.328
Let him throw his tantrum.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.038
The man disappeared
for three damn weeks,

38:11.122 --> 38:13.540
and I put this deal together.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.292
What more do you need to know?

38:18.213 --> 38:21.215
Duck, would you
excuse us for a minute?

38:25.095 --> 38:26.220
Of course.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.067
This doesn't affect the merger, does it?

38:40.151 --> 38:41.902
No.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.905
He never could hold his liquor.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.326
Mr. Draper, your wife called.

38:49.411 --> 38:50.953
She wants you to come home.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.832
You should go home as well.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.667
I can't even think right now.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.253
Greg says they put St. Luke's on alert.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.266
Your bag.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.726
I don't need it.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.186
Good night.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.521
...this correspondent

39:17.605 --> 39:19.189
that there is more
firepower now in Cuba

39:19.274 --> 39:21.275
than at any time during World War...

39:34.998 --> 39:36.206
Why are you smiling?

39:36.291 --> 39:38.250
Because you're still here.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.210
I was hoping
the train would be empty.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.588
Have a drink with me.

39:42.672 --> 39:44.506
Okay.

39:55.310 --> 39:58.103
Why are you still here?
Trudy must be worried.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.981
What is it with you?

40:01.066 --> 40:02.232
What?

40:03.443 --> 40:06.528
You never let me talk
about what I want to talk about.

40:08.156 --> 40:11.909
What do you want to talk about?

40:11.993 --> 40:15.329
About what you said about the truth.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.415
Can I tell you the truth?

40:18.500 --> 40:20.793
Why wouldn't you?

40:20.877 --> 40:23.212
You make it so hard.

40:23.296 --> 40:25.172
What are you talking about?

40:27.008 --> 40:28.342
You.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.349
I've been thinking
about everything that's going on.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.228
And I thought...

40:39.312 --> 40:41.522
who'd care if I was gone?

40:41.606 --> 40:43.524
I mean, Trudy would care,

40:43.608 --> 40:45.359
but she doesn't know me.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.821
But you do.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.282
And I know you.

40:54.327 --> 40:57.079
And I think you're perfect.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.291
I'm not perfect, Pete.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.377
Yes, you are.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.673
And I wish l had picked you then.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.218
Pete.

41:15.557 --> 41:18.517
I loνe you.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.602
And I want to be with you.

41:25.859 --> 41:27.234
What?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.404
Didn't you know that?

41:35.702 --> 41:38.036
Pete,

41:38.121 --> 41:43.417
I could have had you in my life forever
if I wanted to.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.337
What do you mean?

41:49.090 --> 41:51.216
I could have had you.

41:51.301 --> 41:54.428
I could have shamed you
into being with me.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.724
But I didn't want to.

41:59.976 --> 42:03.228
I don't understand.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.446
You got me pregnant.

42:14.991 --> 42:17.868
I had a baby,

42:17.952 --> 42:19.828
and I gaνe it away.

42:19.913 --> 42:22.915
What?

42:25.168 --> 42:28.295
I had your baby,

42:28.379 --> 42:31.465
and I gaνe it away.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.344
Are you serious?

42:40.850 --> 42:43.352
You can't be serious.

42:43.436 --> 42:47.481
I wanted other things.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.734
I don't understand.

42:55.490 --> 42:57.407
Well,

42:57.492 --> 43:01.411
one day you're there...

43:01.496 --> 43:05.082
and then, all of a sudden...

43:05.166 --> 43:08.252
there's less of you,

43:08.336 --> 43:10.921
and you wonder

43:11.005 --> 43:14.633
where that part went,

43:14.717 --> 43:19.429
if it's liνing somewhere outside of you.

43:22.100 --> 43:25.894
And you keep thinking...

43:25.979 --> 43:28.397
maybe you'll get it back.

43:32.527 --> 43:36.238
And then you realize...

43:36.322 --> 43:39.533
it's just gone.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.871
Why would you tell me that?

43:48.751 --> 43:50.669
I'm sorry, Pete.

44:15.903 --> 44:17.404
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

44:17.488 --> 44:19.573
You're home.

45:08.623 --> 45:10.123
At about 2 p.m.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.583
yesterday afternoon,

45:11.709 --> 45:16.505
set out to intercept the Marucla.

45:16.589 --> 45:21.468
She was assisted
by S2F's tracker aircraft.

45:21.552 --> 45:24.471
The Pierce made contact
with the Marucla--

45:24.555 --> 45:26.056
They finally went down.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.683
...at about 1 0:30 p.m. last night,

45:28.768 --> 45:32.062
Eastern Daylight Time.

45:32.146 --> 45:33.605
Sometime after midnight--

45:33.731 --> 45:35.107
I have to talk to you.

45:35.191 --> 45:39.528
