00:13.079 --> 00:14.746
Paging daughtery
296 to dispatch.

00:14.779 --> 00:15.580
Go ahead, 296.

00:15.614 --> 00:18.217
Requesting air
support and back up.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.551
Oh, vehicle just spun out.

00:19.585 --> 00:20.695
Wrapped around a light pole.

00:20.719 --> 00:21.653
Suspect's on foot!

00:21.687 --> 00:23.623
I repeat, the suspect's on foot.

00:23.655 --> 00:26.192
Roger that.

00:26.225 --> 00:28.560
Paging dodge PC meyers for..

00:28.594 --> 00:29.128
Roger that.

00:29.161 --> 00:31.130
Show them how it's done.

00:31.163 --> 00:31.996
You hear that?

00:32.030 --> 00:33.533
You've got to show
me how it's done.

00:33.566 --> 00:36.269
Just stay close and
keep an eye on my six.

00:36.301 --> 00:40.305
Oh, don't you worry, d.
I see everything, even

00:40.338 --> 00:42.174
that condescending reaction.

00:42.207 --> 00:44.409
Do us both a favor
and watch my back.

00:44.442 --> 00:46.278
Listen to me, there's
no way out back there.

00:46.311 --> 00:47.622
Three seconds from
now, he's going

00:47.646 --> 00:49.548
to come running out the
same way he went in.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.185
3, 2, 1.

00:55.621 --> 00:56.856
For Christ sakes, Myers.

01:00.192 --> 01:01.194
Ok, maybe you were right.

01:01.226 --> 01:02.466
I'm going to check around back.

01:02.494 --> 01:03.494
Myers!

01:16.441 --> 01:16.942
It's over!

01:16.975 --> 01:18.411
Show me your hands!

01:18.444 --> 01:19.478
Don't be stupid, buddy!

01:19.512 --> 01:21.713
Put your hands in the air!

01:21.746 --> 01:24.316
Now!

01:24.349 --> 01:26.318
Back up toward me slowly!

01:32.158 --> 01:36.429
Get down on your knees and lace
your fingers behind your head!

01:47.939 --> 01:50.308
PC daughtery 296 to dispatch.

01:50.341 --> 01:52.578
We have the suspect cornered
behind dock auto on depot.

01:52.611 --> 01:55.148
He's injured badly,
possible head trauma.

01:55.180 --> 01:56.816
Requesting medical.

02:07.659 --> 02:10.629
It began early this
morning around 4:00 am

02:10.663 --> 02:13.499
when police received
an anonymous phone call

02:13.532 --> 02:16.868
reporting an assault
at this very residence.

02:16.901 --> 02:19.871
Soon after, calls
reporting an erratic driver

02:19.905 --> 02:21.640
came flooding in.

02:21.674 --> 02:25.278
And after what appeared to be
a near fatal head-on collision

02:25.311 --> 02:29.682
off of depot street, the driver
exited the stolen vehicle

02:29.715 --> 02:32.551
where he was confronted
by two officers.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.854
Now, we understand that
one of those officers

02:34.887 --> 02:38.524
was involved in some sort of
confrontation with the suspect.

02:38.556 --> 02:41.293
What followed is still unclear.

02:41.326 --> 02:44.896
But be advised, there
is a dangerous criminal

02:44.930 --> 02:46.265
on the loose.

02:46.298 --> 02:48.367
Stay tuned for updates.

03:13.758 --> 03:19.397
It was so nice spending
this time with you.

03:19.431 --> 03:25.737
It was so nice spending
this time with you.

03:26.739 --> 03:31.277
It was so nice spending
this time with you.

03:31.310 --> 03:34.514
She should shun the shining sun.

03:37.682 --> 03:40.885
A proper copper coffee pot.

03:40.919 --> 03:44.590
It was so nice spending
this time with you.

03:45.890 --> 03:51.463
It was so nice spending
this time with you.

03:51.497 --> 03:54.400
She should shun the shining sun.

03:54.432 --> 03:57.036
I thought a thought, but
the thought I thought

03:57.068 --> 04:00.805
was not the thought I thought.

04:00.838 --> 04:06.612
It was so nice spending
this time with you.

04:54.425 --> 04:56.762
And after attack a
head-on collision,

04:56.795 --> 04:58.298
police officers followed...

05:06.471 --> 05:09.375
Help!

05:26.959 --> 05:27.959
No!

05:38.937 --> 05:40.105
Are we good?

05:43.875 --> 05:45.745
Go in there.

05:45.778 --> 05:48.447
What do you want?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.415
Go in there.

05:49.447 --> 05:50.447
Ok, ok.

05:54.019 --> 05:55.019
Where are we going?

05:57.488 --> 05:59.891
Sit down.

06:32.757 --> 06:34.726
Why are you all
dressed up like that?

06:34.759 --> 06:35.759
I'm a whore.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.566
Don't move.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.569
Is there anybody else
here in the house?

06:43.601 --> 06:45.069
Not at the moment.

06:45.103 --> 06:46.972
How much company
are you expecting?

06:47.004 --> 06:48.673
Just one guy.

06:48.706 --> 06:50.810
Stand up.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.444
Stand up.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.913
Call him and tell
him he's not coming.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.048
You want me to go
back into the kitchen?

06:57.081 --> 06:58.081
Yes, now.

07:17.702 --> 07:19.938
What makes you think
he'll listen to me?

07:19.971 --> 07:21.774
Why wouldn't he?

07:21.807 --> 07:24.143
Just call them and tell
them you're occupied.

07:24.175 --> 07:26.711
I charge five grand an
hour, and he's already

07:26.745 --> 07:28.014
paid the first one up front.

07:30.882 --> 07:32.050
Did you think I was joking?

07:32.084 --> 07:34.620
Just call him and tell him
you'll give him his money back.

07:34.653 --> 07:36.021
This isn't a retail store.

07:36.053 --> 07:37.589
I can't just offer him a refund.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.726
Look, I'll do what you say.

07:41.759 --> 07:43.238
I'll call him and
tell him not to come.

07:43.262 --> 07:46.598
But you need to know that this
guy... he isn't just anybody.

07:46.632 --> 07:47.600
He knows people.

07:47.632 --> 07:48.834
And he is dangerous.

07:48.867 --> 07:49.935
One wrong word...

07:49.968 --> 07:50.968
Just make the call!

08:12.089 --> 08:13.089
Stop.

08:17.129 --> 08:18.129
Who are you calling?

08:20.699 --> 08:21.667
Are you listening to me?

08:21.699 --> 08:22.735
Who were calling?

08:22.767 --> 08:23.301
My client.

08:23.334 --> 08:23.935
Bullshit.

08:23.968 --> 08:24.937
You were calling the cops.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.939
Last I checked, their
number starts with 9.

08:26.971 --> 08:28.774
And what would I have
said to them exactly?

08:35.046 --> 08:37.083
Those helicopters are
for you, aren't they?

08:40.818 --> 08:41.818
What's your name?

08:44.822 --> 08:47.192
Well, whoever you
are, I can help you.

08:47.225 --> 08:49.628
Just please don't hurt me.

08:49.660 --> 08:50.828
How are you going to help me?

08:50.861 --> 08:53.932
For starters, it looks like
you need medical attention.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.301
You probably have a concussion.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.168
So now you have a
medical degree too?

08:57.201 --> 08:59.672
Some of my clients like to
get smacked around a bit.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.274
In fact, they pay
a premium for it.

09:02.307 --> 09:03.418
It's my job to
know their limits.

09:03.442 --> 09:07.613
And I have successfully
resuscitated so many perverts.

09:07.645 --> 09:09.180
I know what I'm doing, ok?

09:09.214 --> 09:10.349
Are you asking my opinion?

09:10.381 --> 09:12.025
Because no, I don't think
you know what you're doing.

09:12.049 --> 09:13.851
I think you're
scared and confused.

09:13.884 --> 09:14.995
At the very least, I know...

09:15.019 --> 09:16.163
Jesus Christ, what do you do?

09:16.187 --> 09:18.624
You talk guys into getting off?

09:18.657 --> 09:20.692
I'm just trying to help.

09:20.725 --> 09:23.128
I don't give a shit about
you or what you think.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.063
I need money, and I
need a place to hide.

09:25.096 --> 09:26.631
If you do anything
to mess with me,

09:26.664 --> 09:28.634
I swear to god i'm
going to kill you.

09:28.667 --> 09:29.667
You got that?

09:32.037 --> 09:35.040
There's a safe downstairs
in the dungeon.

09:35.072 --> 09:37.009
It's everything I've
earned all year.

09:37.042 --> 09:39.244
Just take it and hide
here as long as you want.

09:39.277 --> 09:40.346
Just please don't hurt me.

09:43.347 --> 09:45.617
Dungeon?

09:45.650 --> 09:46.930
What do you call it, the cellar?

09:49.321 --> 09:50.288
What about your company?

09:50.322 --> 09:51.756
It's a big house.

09:51.789 --> 09:53.229
I'll do what he paid
me for upstairs.

09:53.258 --> 09:54.660
You can hide in the guest room.

09:54.692 --> 09:55.293
I'm not hiding.

09:55.326 --> 09:57.796
Aren't you?

09:57.828 --> 09:59.664
Look, just take the
money and leave.

09:59.697 --> 10:01.174
My neighbor... she's
got to be about 80.

10:01.198 --> 10:02.099
She doesn't lock the door.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.836
You could stay there
as long as you want.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.806
You got any tape or
rope or something?

10:07.839 --> 10:09.074
What for?

10:09.106 --> 10:11.776
What do you think?

10:11.809 --> 10:12.809
Top drawer.

10:20.418 --> 10:21.720
This is yarn.

10:21.753 --> 10:23.193
There ought to be
tape in there, too.

10:29.927 --> 10:30.862
This is scotch tape.

10:30.895 --> 10:32.664
Is there a particular
brand you'd prefer?

10:36.400 --> 10:37.368
You're making fun of me?

10:37.402 --> 10:38.336
No.

10:38.370 --> 10:39.270
You think I'm stupid?

10:39.303 --> 10:40.204
I'm not making fun of you.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.074
And no, it's just
hard to think straight

10:42.106 --> 10:43.241
under all this pressure.

10:43.274 --> 10:44.976
I'm only trying to help.

10:45.009 --> 10:46.979
And I have been nothing
but cooperative.

11:05.764 --> 11:07.132
You hear that?

11:07.164 --> 11:09.168
Hear what?

11:09.201 --> 11:10.936
Ringing in the ears?

11:10.969 --> 11:12.371
Nausea?

11:12.403 --> 11:13.004
Dizziness?

11:13.038 --> 11:14.038
I was right.

11:14.072 --> 11:15.340
Concussion.

11:15.373 --> 11:17.410
You should really
drink something.

11:24.048 --> 11:25.083
Take me to the safe.

11:25.116 --> 11:27.819
You're going to tie me up?

11:27.852 --> 11:30.188
I'm good.

11:30.221 --> 11:31.221
This way.

11:52.943 --> 11:55.046
Go on.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.080
After you.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.100
This way.

12:53.437 --> 12:56.207
Can I answer the door?

12:56.240 --> 12:57.842
Open the safe first.

12:57.875 --> 12:59.211
I'll be right back.

12:59.244 --> 13:00.112
You have my word.

13:00.144 --> 13:03.481
I just don't want
to keep him waiting.

13:03.514 --> 13:05.918
I'm only trying to help when
I say this, but this man...

13:05.951 --> 13:07.385
He's very dangerous, I know.

13:07.418 --> 13:09.520
If anything should happen,
people will come looking.

13:09.553 --> 13:14.025
Nobody is going to care
about a missing whore.

13:14.058 --> 13:15.226
You raise a good point.

13:19.865 --> 13:20.999
Answer the door.

13:21.032 --> 13:23.134
Do whatever you got to do.

13:23.168 --> 13:25.104
If anything's off,
I will end you both.

14:04.042 --> 14:08.413
There he is, my loyal
knight in shining armor.

14:08.446 --> 14:10.349
Why do I keep coming back here?

14:10.381 --> 14:11.449
You sound angry.

14:11.482 --> 14:12.950
What is there to be happy about?

14:12.984 --> 14:15.320
Well, for one, you're
still standing.

14:15.352 --> 14:18.322
And two, you're about to be
pampered like the little lapdog

14:18.355 --> 14:19.323
you are.

14:19.356 --> 14:20.925
I'm a big dog.

14:20.958 --> 14:24.562
I'm like a pit bull
or a rottweiler.

14:24.596 --> 14:27.164
How about a Saint Bernard?

14:27.197 --> 14:30.235
I always thought there was
a sweetness to your soul.

14:30.268 --> 14:33.538
After all, that's
why I chose you.

14:33.571 --> 14:34.505
You chose me?

14:34.538 --> 14:35.908
Sure.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.581
All the other girls
wanted a piece of you,

14:37.609 --> 14:39.945
but I raised my hand
and snapped my fingers

14:39.977 --> 14:43.447
and they scurried
away like insects.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.149
Something just
doesn't feel right.

14:45.182 --> 14:47.552
I don't think I should be here.

14:47.585 --> 14:49.687
You say that you have a choice.

14:49.721 --> 14:51.956
Remember where you are.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.057
I'm with you.

14:53.091 --> 14:56.028
That's right.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.663
And you're my good
boy, aren't you?

14:58.697 --> 15:00.532
Yes, ma'am.

15:00.565 --> 15:03.268
And have you been a good boy?

15:03.301 --> 15:04.369
No.

15:04.402 --> 15:06.705
Does that mean you're
going to pee on the carpet?

15:06.738 --> 15:07.539
No.

15:07.572 --> 15:08.472
Good.

15:08.506 --> 15:12.076
Because if you do,
I'll have to spank you.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.079
Yes, ma'am.

15:14.111 --> 15:15.423
You want to go in
that other room?

15:15.447 --> 15:16.581
Would you like that?

15:16.614 --> 15:17.282
Yes.

15:17.315 --> 15:18.283
Yes, what?

15:18.316 --> 15:20.052
Yes, ma'am.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.320
Good boy.

15:24.489 --> 15:27.059
Don't let the door
hit you in the tail.

17:06.223 --> 17:07.291
Who was that?

17:11.261 --> 17:11.895
Quiet.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.466
There's someone downstairs.

17:14.499 --> 17:17.068
Someone's being a naughty boy.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.170
What are you doing?

17:18.202 --> 17:19.136
Are you recording this?

17:19.170 --> 17:20.105
Remember where you are.

17:20.137 --> 17:22.473
You know what my people do to??

17:22.507 --> 17:24.043
There's nobody here.

17:26.478 --> 17:27.079
Quiet.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.180
Stay there.

17:28.212 --> 17:29.013
Is this vomit?

17:29.047 --> 17:30.248
You little liar.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.849
There must be another dog here.

17:31.883 --> 17:33.351
What do you mean another dog?

17:33.384 --> 17:36.421
You're still my number one.

17:36.453 --> 17:38.557
Freddy, did you do this?

17:38.589 --> 17:39.290
Enough.

17:39.324 --> 17:40.292
Enough of that.

17:40.325 --> 17:41.325
Freddy.

17:43.728 --> 17:45.363
I'm done with you.

17:45.395 --> 17:48.232
You must have
forgotten who I am.

17:48.266 --> 17:50.669
Freddy, please.

17:50.701 --> 17:52.403
You know how much I need you.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.543
You're right.

17:58.576 --> 18:02.581
There is somebody here,
somewhere very dangerous.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.415
And he's in this room.

18:10.788 --> 18:12.758
Big dog's coming for you.

18:20.397 --> 18:22.900
Oh!

18:22.933 --> 18:26.303
You little shit!

18:50.627 --> 18:52.696
You could have just
told him to heel.

18:52.730 --> 18:53.765
Open the safe.

18:53.798 --> 18:54.665
Please don't hurt me.

18:54.699 --> 18:57.169
I was trying to warn you.

18:57.201 --> 18:58.103
Open the safe.

18:58.136 --> 18:58.769
There's only a matter
of time before he

18:58.804 --> 18:59.604
checked behind the boiler...

18:59.636 --> 19:00.636
Now!

19:31.903 --> 19:33.404
You going to kill me now?

19:36.507 --> 19:39.211
I swear I'm not
expecting anyone else.

19:42.747 --> 19:44.316
Shall we?

19:44.348 --> 19:45.348
Shall we, what?

19:47.518 --> 19:48.518
Someone's at the door.

20:18.316 --> 20:19.316
Stop.

20:22.953 --> 20:24.455
Did you call the cops?

20:24.489 --> 20:26.857
When would I have had
time to do that exactly?

20:26.891 --> 20:28.692
I'm sure you know the
police don't exactly

20:28.726 --> 20:30.462
support my line of work.

20:30.494 --> 20:32.463
And now there's a
guy in a room where

20:32.497 --> 20:34.298
I keep stacks of dirty money.

20:34.332 --> 20:35.300
If you gave them any...

20:35.333 --> 20:36.032
Yes!

20:36.034 --> 20:36.868
I know!

20:36.901 --> 20:38.436
Coming!

20:46.443 --> 20:48.747
Sorry, big house.

20:48.779 --> 20:50.749
That's ok.

20:50.781 --> 20:52.049
I don't want to bother you.

20:52.083 --> 20:55.954
We don't want to bother
you for too long.

20:55.987 --> 20:58.790
Should we come inside?

20:58.823 --> 21:00.825
Can I just help
here from in here?

21:00.857 --> 21:03.360
I just got out of the shower
and I left the water running.

21:03.394 --> 21:06.364
You just got out of the shower?

21:06.396 --> 21:08.832
Again, ma'am, sorry
to bother you.

21:08.865 --> 21:11.068
I'm not sure if you've
seen the news today,

21:11.102 --> 21:15.807
but there's been a pretty large
scale manhunt for a guy who...

21:15.839 --> 21:18.842
Let's just say you probably
don't want him near your house.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.378
We believe he's hiding
out in the neighborhood.

21:21.412 --> 21:22.713
What did he do?

21:22.747 --> 21:25.350
Listen, ma'am, I'm not
looking to scare anyone.

21:25.383 --> 21:27.585
He shot me.

21:27.617 --> 21:28.552
You look fine.

21:28.586 --> 21:29.953
I got lucky.

21:29.987 --> 21:32.590
We just want to make sure he
does not hurt anyone else.

21:32.623 --> 21:33.790
That's right.

21:33.824 --> 21:35.601
So we're going door to door
asking everybody if they've

21:35.625 --> 21:37.862
seen anything, heard anything.

21:37.894 --> 21:39.663
I've been here all day.

21:39.696 --> 21:40.831
Ok.

21:40.865 --> 21:44.368
Well, he's a Caucasian male,
long dark hair, big nose.

21:44.402 --> 21:45.170
It's pronounces.

21:45.202 --> 21:47.739
I haven't seen or
heard anything.

21:47.771 --> 21:48.772
Are you ok?

21:48.806 --> 21:50.107
You seem to be a bit flustered.

21:50.141 --> 21:52.444
Sorry, this is just
my default state.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.447
It's been a soul crushing
couple of months for me.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.582
Oh, tell me about it.

21:58.816 --> 22:00.552
You don't seem to
be hurting too bad.

22:06.423 --> 22:08.926
Well, you know the drill.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.528
Anything suspicious, you go
ahead and give us a holler.

22:11.561 --> 22:12.796
Of course.

22:12.829 --> 22:13.897
Good luck on your search.

22:13.931 --> 22:15.667
Thank you for your service.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.937
Hey, thank you for yours.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.538
You have a good afternoon.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.677
Are you ok?

22:26.711 --> 22:29.146
You mentioned that you
were in the shower?

22:29.180 --> 22:30.815
How come your hair is not wet?

22:30.847 --> 22:31.915
Hm?

22:31.949 --> 22:34.552
You said you were in the
shower, but your hair is dry

22:34.585 --> 22:36.520
and you have a full
face of makeup.

22:36.554 --> 22:39.791
I wear a shower cap
for the bouffant.

22:39.824 --> 22:42.961
And the makeup, ma'am.

22:42.993 --> 22:44.695
What's a bouffant?

22:44.729 --> 22:46.698
It's a bit dated, I know.

22:46.730 --> 22:47.932
Is it like a hairstyle?

22:47.964 --> 22:50.968
Yeah, it's this
sort of poofy hair.

22:51.001 --> 22:51.935
Before your time.

22:51.969 --> 22:52.803
Yes.

22:52.836 --> 22:54.905
Yes, my mother had
something similar.

22:54.939 --> 22:56.740
You know what?

22:56.773 --> 22:58.175
You wear it better.

22:58.209 --> 23:00.111
Thank you.

23:00.144 --> 23:00.778
Ok.

23:00.811 --> 23:02.980
Well, sorry again to bother.

23:03.013 --> 23:04.748
You have a great afternoon.

23:04.781 --> 23:06.717
Come on, let's go.

23:06.750 --> 23:07.750
Take care, now.

23:11.588 --> 23:13.825
So you're dangerous, huh?

23:13.857 --> 23:14.857
You kill someone?

23:18.663 --> 23:19.497
Don't do that.

23:19.529 --> 23:20.529
I have a right to know.

23:36.847 --> 23:37.847
Murderer!

23:44.855 --> 23:47.959
Does that feel nice?

23:47.991 --> 23:50.060
You really shouldn't be
under all this stress,

23:50.094 --> 23:53.465
not in your condition.

23:53.498 --> 23:54.599
What condition?

23:54.632 --> 23:56.935
Your head, silly.

23:56.968 --> 23:58.903
You cracked it open in...

23:58.935 --> 24:00.204
What is it?

24:00.238 --> 24:01.972
A car crash?

24:02.006 --> 24:03.807
Now, just for my
own edification,

24:03.840 --> 24:06.644
was this before or after
you killed someone?

24:06.676 --> 24:08.178
Stop saying that.

24:08.211 --> 24:10.181
What, that you killed someone?

24:10.213 --> 24:11.213
You did, didn't you?

24:14.818 --> 24:16.186
How did I get here?

24:16.220 --> 24:18.990
David byrne asked
that same question.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.826
And no, this is not
your beautiful house.

24:21.858 --> 24:25.797
And no, I am not
your beautiful wife.

24:25.829 --> 24:27.064
What happened to my arm?

24:27.097 --> 24:28.232
Oh, yeah.

24:28.266 --> 24:29.401
That's new.

24:29.433 --> 24:32.803
You fell on your knife, tore
right through the tendon.

24:32.836 --> 24:35.240
Technically it's my knife,
but you can have it.

24:35.272 --> 24:36.307
It's pure silver.

24:36.340 --> 24:38.275
Dates all the way back
to the holy Roman empire.

24:38.308 --> 24:39.308
True story.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.548
Where are my clothes?

24:44.582 --> 24:45.250
I get it.

24:45.282 --> 24:46.427
You've got a lot on your mind.

24:46.451 --> 24:50.020
But any other situation and
you would care about that.

24:50.054 --> 24:51.054
Why are you doing this?

24:55.893 --> 24:59.596
You've heard of the
Siegel crime syndicate?

24:59.630 --> 25:05.270
Well, that guy you killed is
the grandson nephew somebody

25:05.303 --> 25:06.971
something of the founder.

25:07.003 --> 25:09.907
Anyway, he's a bad guy who
made some bad decisions.

25:09.941 --> 25:12.710
And now he's dead.

25:12.742 --> 25:15.579
I don't have to
describe crime to you

25:15.613 --> 25:17.882
because you're a
criminal, but it's

25:17.914 --> 25:20.884
a highly emotional occupation.

25:20.917 --> 25:23.887
Anyway, sometime
tonight, maybe tomorrow

25:23.921 --> 25:28.125
I guess there are going to be
some bad guys with big bad guns

25:28.159 --> 25:30.762
that are going to
come and kill us both.

25:30.795 --> 25:31.930
I don't stand a chance.

25:31.962 --> 25:34.965
But if I keep you
alive, you could

25:34.999 --> 25:38.603
use that holy Roman knife
you stabbed yourself with

25:38.635 --> 25:41.705
to, I don't know,
save our lives.

25:44.642 --> 25:47.679
Why are you looking
at me like that?

25:47.711 --> 25:49.113
Do you not believe me?

25:49.145 --> 25:51.950
Please, stop talking.

25:51.982 --> 25:53.884
I don't care.

25:53.917 --> 25:55.319
You do believe me, don't you?

25:55.353 --> 25:57.689
Who gives a shit what I think?

25:57.721 --> 26:02.693
Given the situation, I'd say you
are in a pretty good situation.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.063
Not everyone who
winds up on air 7 news

26:05.096 --> 26:07.699
ends up in a steamy bath
with a private escort

26:07.731 --> 26:09.701
later that night.

26:09.733 --> 26:12.971
I'm not buying any of your time.

26:13.003 --> 26:17.608
And I'm not some plaything to
some bored whatever you are.

26:17.642 --> 26:22.113
And I'm really not in the
mood for whatever this is.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.615
Well said.

26:24.648 --> 26:26.083
What time is it?

26:26.116 --> 26:27.184
Some place you got to be?

26:27.218 --> 26:32.789
Jesus Christ, is every
answer a question with you?

26:32.823 --> 26:33.858
Is this your plan?

26:33.891 --> 26:37.862
Are you just going to act
all calm and funny and...

26:37.894 --> 26:41.965
What, I'm just supposed
to sit back and trust you?

26:41.999 --> 26:44.902
You think I'm funny?

26:44.934 --> 26:47.038
I'm comfortable with you.

26:47.070 --> 26:49.272
I think we have a lot in common.

26:49.306 --> 26:50.708
Whatever.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.276
We're both criminals.

26:52.308 --> 26:53.978
Whores aren't criminals.

26:54.010 --> 26:57.382
Progressive idea, but
highly inaccurate.

26:57.414 --> 26:59.783
Why didn't you kill me
when you had the chance?

26:59.817 --> 27:00.884
Who says I'm not going to?

27:04.288 --> 27:07.258
You like that, don't
you, being dangerous?

27:07.290 --> 27:09.226
Why would I like that?

27:09.259 --> 27:10.127
Fear gives you power.

27:10.161 --> 27:12.663
Power feels good, no?

27:12.696 --> 27:14.731
I'd listen to those cops.

27:14.765 --> 27:16.334
I am dangerous.

27:16.366 --> 27:18.403
And I did kill someone.

27:18.435 --> 27:20.203
Oh, I saw.

27:20.237 --> 27:24.409
You killed Freddy
with a dog collar.

27:24.442 --> 27:28.078
And I think you liked it.

27:28.112 --> 27:29.413
What about that other guy?

27:29.446 --> 27:30.748
What'd you do to him?

27:37.354 --> 27:40.158
I don't believe you.

27:40.191 --> 27:42.994
Nobody's coming.

27:43.027 --> 27:44.895
You see, I've been
where you are before,

27:44.929 --> 27:46.163
at the mercy of somebody else.

27:46.196 --> 27:47.196
You'll say anything.

27:51.969 --> 27:55.373
I appreciate this and
for not killing me

27:55.405 --> 27:59.777
when you had the chance,
but I don't owe you shit.

27:59.809 --> 28:01.712
Now, I'm going to hide
out here until whoever

28:01.746 --> 28:03.848
is in charge of finding me
either gives up or dies.

28:03.881 --> 28:07.951
And when this all blows
over, I will disappear.

28:10.954 --> 28:12.156
What's in it for me?

28:15.392 --> 28:18.229
You can sleep with
your eyes closed,

28:18.261 --> 28:19.963
live the rest of your
life not wondering

28:19.997 --> 28:22.167
when I'm going to come
and slit your throat.

28:41.919 --> 28:44.255
Where are my clothes?

28:44.288 --> 28:48.092
In the wash, obviously.

28:48.125 --> 28:49.426
You can borrow
something of mine.

29:00.336 --> 29:01.204
Where's my knife?

29:01.238 --> 29:02.273
In the dishwasher.

29:15.219 --> 29:17.788
Here, walkie talkie.

29:17.821 --> 29:18.821
Hey.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.360
Hey.

29:23.394 --> 29:24.394
Asshole.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.502
Stay with me.

29:34.505 --> 29:35.439
Steve!

29:35.471 --> 29:36.507
Stop him!

29:36.539 --> 29:39.442
Steve, he's coming outside!

29:54.858 --> 29:55.926
Who was that?

29:55.960 --> 29:58.095
At the door, who was knocking?

29:58.127 --> 30:00.364
You believe me now?

30:00.396 --> 30:01.566
How many of them are there?

30:01.598 --> 30:02.066
Could be one.

30:02.099 --> 30:03.166
Could be an army.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.302
An army?

30:04.335 --> 30:05.937
Who is this guy?

30:05.970 --> 30:08.005
Oh, now you want to listen?

30:08.038 --> 30:11.875
Did you set this up when I
was knocked out unconscious?

30:11.909 --> 30:14.545
You think I told Freddy to
beat his head against a wall

30:14.577 --> 30:16.279
while I called the
Siegel family and had

30:16.313 --> 30:18.049
them open my front door?

30:18.082 --> 30:19.383
He wasn't breathing.

30:19.415 --> 30:20.417
He was dead.

30:20.451 --> 30:21.618
You suffocated him.

30:21.652 --> 30:24.188
He probably suffered
severe brain damage.

30:24.221 --> 30:26.391
But he's still alive, but
now he's getting away.

30:40.371 --> 30:44.041
You going to take them
all out with that knife?

30:44.074 --> 30:45.276
I'm not taking anyone out.

30:45.308 --> 30:46.176
I'm leaving.

30:46.210 --> 30:47.979
That seems unwise.

30:48.011 --> 30:48.613
How's that?

30:48.645 --> 30:51.414
Where are you going to go?

30:51.448 --> 30:53.217
I don't know.

30:53.250 --> 30:55.586
Your 80-year-old neighbor's
house who never locks the door.

30:55.618 --> 30:58.121
As if they haven't
questioned her yet?

30:58.154 --> 30:59.322
Well, I'll get rid of her.

30:59.355 --> 31:01.192
Right.

31:01.224 --> 31:03.026
And when her son calls
to check up on her

31:03.059 --> 31:04.536
or she doesn't show
up for bridge which

31:04.560 --> 31:07.664
he attends every Friday
at tenderheart, what then?

31:07.698 --> 31:09.901
You're going to have quite
the bloodbath on your hands.

31:09.933 --> 31:10.535
Ok.

31:10.567 --> 31:11.335
The window was your idea.

31:11.367 --> 31:12.001
I was scared.

31:12.036 --> 31:12.403
I would have said anything.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.370
You said so.

31:13.403 --> 31:16.073
So what's changed?

31:16.105 --> 31:18.375
Time.

31:18.409 --> 31:20.311
I spent my life around
truly bad people.

31:24.248 --> 31:27.985
You're different.

31:28.018 --> 31:30.153
I don't know what
you're trying to do,

31:30.186 --> 31:31.955
but you're wrong about that.

31:31.989 --> 31:33.958
Why'd you kill him?

31:33.990 --> 31:34.858
Who?

31:34.892 --> 31:37.428
The police are after
you for something.

31:37.461 --> 31:38.461
Why'd you do it?

31:42.132 --> 31:43.132
Get me a bag.

31:46.269 --> 31:47.269
Bottom drawer.

32:08.592 --> 32:09.592
You're smart.

32:26.777 --> 32:27.777
Where'd you go?

32:33.750 --> 32:35.019
Where'd you put the money?

32:39.355 --> 32:41.125
Oh, we're going to run?

32:52.603 --> 32:53.336
Where you at?

32:53.369 --> 32:53.971
Oh.

32:54.003 --> 32:55.005
You're alone, aren't you?

33:06.482 --> 33:07.482
Where are you?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.423
Where's the money?

33:51.595 --> 33:52.596
What the...

34:34.204 --> 34:36.707
Can you help me with the door?

34:36.739 --> 34:39.476
I could use a hand.

34:39.510 --> 34:40.510
Never mind.

35:01.331 --> 35:05.236
Look, if I was going to
poison you, I would...

35:05.268 --> 35:06.369
Good.

35:06.402 --> 35:07.402
To survival.

35:12.509 --> 35:15.278
I'm sorry.

35:15.311 --> 35:17.914
Either I was wrong about
the whole army thing

35:17.947 --> 35:21.851
or they're closing in on us
now and this is our last drink.

35:21.885 --> 35:25.890
Either way, I'm sorry, truly.

35:25.922 --> 35:29.592
I know what you're doing.

35:29.626 --> 35:32.763
Do you now?

35:32.795 --> 35:35.498
There's no one else here.

35:35.532 --> 35:36.701
There's no one else coming.

35:39.835 --> 35:42.539
You hid the money
when I was out cold.

35:42.572 --> 35:45.710
And you set this whole thing
up just to mess with me.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.950
Do you know how stars die?

35:52.983 --> 35:55.619
Their internal engines
run out, and then

35:55.652 --> 36:01.224
the crushing weight of gravity
causes them to explode.

36:01.257 --> 36:04.227
Or they do reality television.

36:04.260 --> 36:06.697
Do you think that's
how we'll die?

36:06.730 --> 36:09.432
The crushing guilt of
everything we've ever done

36:09.465 --> 36:11.701
will just overtake us?

36:11.735 --> 36:12.937
We are nothing alike.

36:16.005 --> 36:17.005
I'm not offended.

36:19.610 --> 36:23.881
I don't actually think you blame
me for anything that happened.

36:23.914 --> 36:27.384
I don't think you exactly
blame yourself either.

36:27.416 --> 36:30.621
Can I venture a guess
as to what's going on?

36:30.653 --> 36:31.956
I'd really rather you didn't.

36:31.989 --> 36:34.992
I think you don't
know who to blame.

36:35.025 --> 36:38.494
That must be very confusing
because if no one's

36:38.527 --> 36:41.297
to blame for your life not
going according to plan,

36:41.331 --> 36:44.434
then what happened?

36:44.467 --> 36:46.636
Maybe you're cursed.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.672
But you're not superstitious.

36:48.704 --> 36:50.840
Maybe god turned
his back on you,

36:50.873 --> 36:57.347
but I'm guessing you wear
that tattoo ironically.

36:57.380 --> 37:01.384
Maybe it's all a cruel
joke, a vendetta?

37:01.418 --> 37:02.952
You consider yourself
a good person.

37:02.985 --> 37:09.859
But at the end of the
day, you're a murderer.

37:09.893 --> 37:13.530
You remind me of voyager
1, playing the same record

37:13.563 --> 37:15.766
over and over again
to nothing but space.

37:15.798 --> 37:17.835
And even though it's
Mozart, how much Mozart can

37:17.867 --> 37:19.603
you really listen to
before you want to...

37:22.539 --> 37:27.578
Who cares if nobody's listening?

37:27.610 --> 37:28.878
Maybe that's it.

37:28.911 --> 37:30.647
Nobody's giving you the time.

37:30.681 --> 37:33.684
You've been used and
ignored for decades.

37:33.717 --> 37:37.320
And now here you sit,
a face full of blood.

37:37.353 --> 37:41.491
And you ask yourself, how
much more can my good soul

37:41.525 --> 37:45.695
endure before it turns
bad, before my Mozart

37:45.728 --> 37:46.864
turns to vanilla ice?

40:03.065 --> 40:05.501
What began as a home invasion

40:05.534 --> 40:08.605
quickly escalated to
a full blown manhunt.

40:08.637 --> 40:13.543
Our victim, Brian foley, ceo
of foley sandhog's labor force,

40:13.577 --> 40:16.647
was attacked in his
home early this morning

40:16.679 --> 40:18.714
by suspect Finn rossi.

40:18.748 --> 40:21.452
Rossi then fled the
scene in foley's vehicle.

40:21.485 --> 40:24.054
And after a head-on
collision, officers

40:24.086 --> 40:26.889
followed a trail of
blood from the wreckage

40:26.922 --> 40:30.092
to the entrance of a
nearby auto body shop.

40:30.126 --> 40:33.797
Now, while his exact
location is still unknown,

40:33.829 --> 40:37.934
officers have been successful
in triangulating his location

40:37.967 --> 40:39.936
to the surrounding neighborhood.

40:39.969 --> 40:42.605
Officers say it is
only a matter of time

40:42.639 --> 40:47.110
before this criminal is
caught and brought to justice.

40:47.143 --> 40:49.880
Now, sir, I understand you
live in the nearby area...

40:51.748 --> 40:53.851
I hid the body in
case you're concerned.

40:53.884 --> 40:56.019
Not exactly something I
want my neighbors to see.

40:58.788 --> 41:00.858
Indeed, I am
stronger than I look.

41:05.528 --> 41:06.838
When I heard the
tires screeching,

41:06.862 --> 41:10.567
I just woke up and
looked out the window...

41:10.599 --> 41:14.770
Most people watching this must
think it's so cut and dry.

41:14.804 --> 41:15.739
You're just a bad dude.

41:15.771 --> 41:17.940
And foley, he must be
a real angel, right?

41:17.974 --> 41:19.076
Please just stop.

41:22.913 --> 41:25.014
I don't see either of us
leaving any time soon.

41:25.047 --> 41:26.883
So why don't you just
tell me what happened?

41:26.916 --> 41:29.085
Why?

41:29.119 --> 41:30.586
Why would that matter to you?

41:30.619 --> 41:32.922
I'm curious.

41:32.956 --> 41:34.692
Well, you should be
scared, not curious.

41:40.230 --> 41:41.063
Please just stop.

41:41.097 --> 41:42.766
Stop what exactly?

41:42.798 --> 41:43.699
Look, we're not friends.

41:43.733 --> 41:45.668
No matter how many
little stories you tell

41:45.702 --> 41:47.312
or how much bullshit
conversation we have,

41:47.336 --> 41:48.938
what I did is none
of your business.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.800
Stop.

42:54.637 --> 42:55.637
Stop.

42:57.373 --> 42:58.373
Stop.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.061
Why don't you have any food?

43:18.094 --> 43:19.862
I don't cook.

43:40.083 --> 43:42.885
You still don't trust me.

43:42.918 --> 43:43.918
I'm hungry.

43:46.088 --> 43:47.088
Take whatever you want.

44:11.081 --> 44:12.716
You going to clean
this up, or are you

44:12.748 --> 44:15.051
just going to leave it
there with the milk?

44:15.085 --> 44:17.320
What do you eat around here?

44:17.353 --> 44:18.954
There's a Mexican
place up the street.

44:18.987 --> 44:19.987
They deliver.

44:25.461 --> 44:26.797
So I take it you're staying?

44:32.936 --> 44:34.237
Where are you going?

44:34.269 --> 44:36.206
To take a shower.

44:36.239 --> 44:37.474
Uh-uh.

44:37.507 --> 44:38.909
Sit down.

44:38.942 --> 44:40.218
You want to keep
your eyes on me?

44:40.242 --> 44:41.010
Fine.

44:41.043 --> 44:42.045
I get it.

44:42.077 --> 44:43.179
Guess you'll have to watch.

45:03.132 --> 45:05.034
Please, make
yourself comfortable.

45:05.068 --> 45:06.437
I'm not going anywhere.

45:19.215 --> 45:21.485
You're really just
going to watch?

45:21.518 --> 45:24.855
Sure I can't tempt
you to join me?

45:24.887 --> 45:27.356
Join me.

45:27.389 --> 45:30.059
Finn, join me.

45:30.092 --> 45:31.161
Join me.

45:31.193 --> 45:34.029
Finn, think about it.

45:34.063 --> 45:38.335
$639,000 stashed
up in that house.

45:38.367 --> 45:41.971
We're the only ones
who know about it.

45:42.005 --> 45:42.939
Don't be stupid.

45:42.972 --> 45:44.274
I'm not.

45:44.306 --> 45:46.108
I'm not stupid.

45:46.141 --> 45:48.444
I hear them talking
about you at work.

45:48.478 --> 45:50.079
They say you would
work for nothing

45:50.112 --> 45:52.381
and not even realize it.

45:52.414 --> 45:55.117
He's always been
real nice to me, Jen.

45:55.150 --> 45:57.086
Trust me, he's the
farthest thing from.

45:59.489 --> 46:00.356
What if you're wrong?

46:00.389 --> 46:01.857
What if he report us?

46:01.891 --> 46:04.360
He's not going to
report his own daughter.

46:04.393 --> 46:06.495
Besides, if he did,
he might as well just

46:06.528 --> 46:09.266
turn own self something.

46:09.298 --> 46:12.168
Besides the IRS, you're
the one paying for it.

46:12.202 --> 46:15.539
You and the sandhogs.

46:15.572 --> 46:16.940
Show me a smile.

46:21.277 --> 46:23.413
What is that?

46:23.445 --> 46:24.581
I'm not good at it.

46:24.614 --> 46:27.150
You're constipated.

46:27.182 --> 46:29.286
I'm just a little nervous, Jen.

46:29.318 --> 46:31.320
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

46:31.353 --> 46:32.489
I got a question for you.

46:32.521 --> 46:34.891
If you can go anywhere in
the world, anywhere at all,

46:34.923 --> 46:36.259
where would it be?

46:36.291 --> 46:37.527
I don't know.

46:37.559 --> 46:38.327
Come on.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.563
You're going to be
a rich man soon.

46:40.597 --> 46:42.833
Half a mill's not
going to make me rich.

46:42.865 --> 46:45.201
He's embezzled so much more.

46:45.235 --> 46:49.972
Besides, it's
639,000 to be exact.

46:50.005 --> 46:54.277
Money like that, a
place like Brazil...

46:54.309 --> 46:56.179
You're rich.

46:56.211 --> 46:57.356
Is that where you want to go?

46:57.380 --> 46:58.548
You want to go to Brazil?

46:58.581 --> 47:01.952
Well, everyone's got a dream.

47:01.985 --> 47:03.019
I've already found mine.

47:11.894 --> 47:12.894
After.

48:33.009 --> 48:34.978
Take whatever you want!

48:35.010 --> 48:36.378
Where's the money?

48:36.411 --> 48:38.180
My wallet's in the
drawer over there.

48:38.213 --> 48:39.047
Not your wallet.

48:39.081 --> 48:40.549
There's plenty of
jewelry upstairs.

48:40.583 --> 48:42.018
I don't want any of that.

48:42.050 --> 48:43.353
You stole from your employees.

48:43.385 --> 48:44.729
I want to know
where that money is.

48:44.753 --> 48:45.422
What?

48:45.454 --> 48:47.056
I've never stolen from anyone.

48:47.090 --> 48:47.724
That's ridiculous.

48:47.757 --> 48:48.358
Bullshit.

48:48.391 --> 48:50.126
639 grand.

48:50.159 --> 48:51.369
I know you've got it somewhere.

48:51.393 --> 48:53.028
And I know it isn't
in a bank account.

48:53.061 --> 48:54.396
I swear to god, I have no idea...

48:55.431 --> 48:57.733
Ok, ok, ok.

48:57.766 --> 49:02.471
One of our administrators found
some sketchy activity going on,

49:02.505 --> 49:05.008
millions of dollars
missing from our accounts.

49:05.041 --> 49:08.378
But I swear on my
children I'm the one that

49:08.411 --> 49:10.713
started the investigation.

49:10.746 --> 49:13.415
I had nothing to do with it!

49:13.449 --> 49:15.018
One of the administrators?

49:15.050 --> 49:17.453
Yeah.

49:17.487 --> 49:20.255
My daughter.

49:20.289 --> 49:21.257
What?

49:21.289 --> 49:22.090
What?

49:22.123 --> 49:24.593
Why would she
report that to you?

49:26.396 --> 49:27.263
Why are you laughing?

49:27.295 --> 49:28.197
What's so funny?

49:28.231 --> 49:29.231
She wouldn't.

49:32.768 --> 49:36.472
It looks like she
stole from me, found

49:36.505 --> 49:40.210
some jackass to pin it on.

49:40.242 --> 49:44.380
I'm happy she's using her brain.

49:44.414 --> 49:47.150
Can't say the same for you.

49:57.226 --> 49:59.496
Shit.

49:59.528 --> 50:01.231
Shit!

50:04.599 --> 50:05.201
Wait.

50:05.233 --> 50:06.233
Stop, stop!

50:17.346 --> 50:21.150
Mr. Foley, do you take
meds or something?

50:21.184 --> 50:22.184
Talk to me.

50:24.454 --> 50:25.121
Wake up!

50:25.153 --> 50:26.153
Wake up!

50:32.228 --> 50:34.431
Finn?

50:34.463 --> 50:36.666
Finn?

50:36.699 --> 50:39.269
Can you hand me a towel?

50:39.302 --> 50:40.769
What about that one?

50:40.802 --> 50:44.706
I want a fresh one.

50:44.739 --> 50:46.275
You can reuse a towel.

50:46.309 --> 50:49.379
I know you can, I
just prefer not to.

50:49.411 --> 50:50.413
So can you just...

50:50.445 --> 50:51.681
Where are they?

50:51.713 --> 50:54.683
In the closet?

50:54.717 --> 50:55.717
Where's the closet?

50:58.721 --> 50:59.721
Never mind.

51:02.358 --> 51:06.563
Someone's a sour sandhog.

51:06.596 --> 51:09.331
What'd you call me?

51:09.364 --> 51:11.500
Why'd you call me a sandhog?

51:11.534 --> 51:13.536
Isn't that what you
do for a living?

51:13.568 --> 51:14.436
Dig?

51:14.469 --> 51:17.506
You dig tunnels?

51:17.539 --> 51:19.476
Who told you that?

51:19.509 --> 51:24.614
Finn, it's really
starting to wear thin.

51:24.646 --> 51:26.181
So what's the plan?

51:26.215 --> 51:28.818
Where do we go from here?

51:28.851 --> 51:30.720
I didn't have a plan.

51:30.753 --> 51:31.788
Really?

51:31.820 --> 51:35.357
You seem like the type
of guy that plans things,

51:35.391 --> 51:37.860
thinks with your head.

51:37.893 --> 51:39.294
Fuck you.

51:39.327 --> 51:41.831
That's the first f bomb
you dropped all night.

51:41.864 --> 51:43.298
I hope it was worth it.

51:43.331 --> 51:46.268
You only get one.

51:46.302 --> 51:47.470
Where are you going?

51:47.503 --> 51:49.905
It's my bedtime.

51:49.938 --> 51:53.175
I didn't say you
can go in there.

51:53.208 --> 51:56.278
Oh, you handsome fool.

51:56.311 --> 52:02.551
Haven't you noticed I've been
doing anything I want all day?

52:02.585 --> 52:06.289
You think you control me?

52:06.322 --> 52:08.590
You're the type of guy
that looks at a sculpture

52:08.623 --> 52:10.926
and feels sorry for the Clay.

52:10.960 --> 52:13.663
What you should be
doing is thanking her

52:13.695 --> 52:17.866
for sculpting you
into something useful.

52:17.900 --> 52:20.470
Good night, voyager 1.

52:41.824 --> 52:47.197
So just because I didn't walk
in here, kill you, I'm soft?

52:47.230 --> 52:48.264
I'm Clay?

52:48.297 --> 52:49.432
If the killing fits.

53:00.409 --> 53:04.881
It's not ironic... my tattoo.

53:04.914 --> 53:05.949
It was my mom's initials.

53:08.583 --> 53:10.219
And I happen to
like vanilla ice.

53:13.289 --> 53:15.458
Then, I guess you're right.

53:15.490 --> 53:17.759
I don't know you at all.

53:17.793 --> 53:22.199
And I bet foley got
what he deserved, right?

53:25.768 --> 53:28.771
What is it you want?

53:28.804 --> 53:30.440
In life?

53:30.472 --> 53:31.574
Let's start with foley.

53:34.043 --> 53:34.978
Money.

53:35.010 --> 53:36.010
And in life?

53:38.780 --> 53:40.416
Money.

53:40.449 --> 53:43.385
What would you spend it on?

53:43.418 --> 53:44.019
Travel.

53:44.052 --> 53:45.922
Travel?

53:45.954 --> 53:47.523
Yeah, travel.

53:47.556 --> 53:48.556
Where would you go?

53:50.992 --> 53:51.860
I don't know.

53:51.893 --> 53:52.661
Why?

53:52.695 --> 53:54.931
You must have some
place in mind.

53:54.963 --> 53:55.963
I don't know.

53:59.402 --> 54:00.869
Maybe Brazil.

54:00.902 --> 54:01.971
Brazil's nice.

54:02.003 --> 54:02.804
You been?

54:02.838 --> 54:03.906
No.

54:03.938 --> 54:05.741
Why do you want to go?

54:05.775 --> 54:06.443
I don't know.

54:06.476 --> 54:07.143
Isn't that the point of travel?

54:07.177 --> 54:08.678
You go places you've never been?

54:11.746 --> 54:12.147
I don't know.

54:12.181 --> 54:13.782
The food's good.

54:13.815 --> 54:15.584
The scenery is pretty.

54:15.617 --> 54:17.786
And I want to see machu picchu.

54:21.791 --> 54:24.027
Might not find that in Brazil.

54:26.829 --> 54:27.897
What's your point?

54:27.929 --> 54:31.867
Aren't you curious how much
money was in that safe?

54:31.900 --> 54:33.635
You mean the money
that just disappeared?

54:33.668 --> 54:37.806
The money I
earned and you nearly stole.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.942
It didn't just disappear.

54:39.974 --> 54:40.876
I have it.

54:40.909 --> 54:43.645
Yeah, no shit.

54:43.679 --> 54:46.883
Do you know how many men
I had to treat like dogs

54:46.916 --> 54:48.818
to earn that?

54:48.851 --> 54:51.521
Actually, the majority of
it came from a client who...

54:51.554 --> 54:53.856
This is a true story...

54:53.889 --> 54:58.795
Had me crush bugs
with my stilettos.

54:58.827 --> 55:04.032
He brought a cardboard box full
of cockroaches to my house.

55:04.065 --> 55:05.734
Now, if you ask
me the psychology

55:05.768 --> 55:08.471
behind that at the time, I
wouldn't know where to begin.

55:08.503 --> 55:10.772
But now that I've had some
time to think about it,

55:10.806 --> 55:15.610
I think he was
turned on by the idea

55:15.643 --> 55:22.117
of a powerful, murderous woman
so strong she could squash

55:22.150 --> 55:26.388
a life with just her shoe.

55:26.422 --> 55:28.490
Oddly enough, the more I
think about it, the sexier

55:28.523 --> 55:31.094
it becomes.

55:31.126 --> 55:35.898
The idea of something so weak
at the mercy of something

55:35.931 --> 55:36.931
so powerful.

55:42.637 --> 55:45.875
Thank you for letting me talk.

55:45.907 --> 55:48.944
You could've squashed me
like a bug, but you didn't.

55:52.047 --> 55:53.782
Night's not over.

55:53.815 --> 55:56.084
You're right about that.

55:56.117 --> 56:00.856
639,000.

56:00.889 --> 56:02.958
That's how much money
was in the safe.

56:02.992 --> 56:07.897
639,000.

56:07.929 --> 56:10.065
You look shocked.

56:10.099 --> 56:11.634
How did you know that?

56:11.666 --> 56:13.936
I'm a good bookkeeper, I guess?

56:16.771 --> 56:19.107
How's your head?

56:19.141 --> 56:21.844
Still dizzy?

56:21.876 --> 56:24.179
Confused?

56:24.213 --> 56:28.584
No doubt that concussion is
getting worse every second.

56:28.617 --> 56:30.687
Without professional
help, you might die.

56:36.125 --> 56:38.527
I'm guessing you want
more than just money.

56:38.561 --> 56:39.561
What the...

56:40.929 --> 56:44.065
Just imagine if it had all
gone according to plan.

56:44.099 --> 56:46.536
Foley was just some bad guy.

56:46.568 --> 56:49.070
Jenny was the love of your life.

56:49.103 --> 56:52.641
Two of you stuck it to the man,
took off like Bonnie and Clyde,

56:52.675 --> 56:55.510
purveyors of justice?

56:55.543 --> 56:57.045
How do you know her name?

56:57.079 --> 57:00.182
First confusion,
then hallucinations.

57:02.918 --> 57:04.153
Yeah.

57:04.186 --> 57:07.824
You definitely need
some professional help.

57:07.856 --> 57:10.759
You put something in my drink.

57:10.793 --> 57:16.666
I'm guessing what you
really want is independence.

57:16.699 --> 57:21.003
If I were you, i'd
be so tired of people

57:21.036 --> 57:25.740
bossing me around, telling me
what to do, manipulating me.

57:25.773 --> 57:27.742
I'm guessing you
just want to make

57:27.775 --> 57:30.045
your own decisions for once.

57:34.884 --> 57:35.884
Finn?

57:37.952 --> 57:40.188
You still with me?

57:43.092 --> 57:45.260
Finn.

57:45.293 --> 57:48.063
I thought I lost you
there for a second.

57:51.266 --> 57:53.268
Did someone knock?

57:53.302 --> 57:55.171
I guess so.

57:55.204 --> 57:57.073
I'd find some place to
hide if I were you.

58:17.992 --> 58:20.596
You guys just can't
stay away, can you?

58:20.628 --> 58:22.297
Sorry to bother again.

58:22.331 --> 58:23.966
But I am...

58:23.998 --> 58:24.666
Are you ok?

58:24.699 --> 58:26.801
Yes, I just feel lightheaded.

58:26.835 --> 58:27.936
You've been here before.

58:27.969 --> 58:29.304
You have, just hours ago.

58:29.338 --> 58:30.139
Do you mind if we...

58:30.172 --> 58:30.972
Come in?

58:31.005 --> 58:31.773
If you don't mind.

58:31.806 --> 58:33.174
Not at all.

58:33.208 --> 58:35.711
Who needs warrants
nowadays anyway?

58:35.744 --> 58:39.215
Certainly not when violent
evil criminals like Finn rossi

58:39.248 --> 58:40.248
are around.

58:47.789 --> 58:49.558
Thank you for cooperating.

58:49.592 --> 58:52.193
Honey, I'm the
only one operating.

58:52.226 --> 58:56.632
Why don't you check out back,
look for signs of forced entry?

58:56.664 --> 58:57.664
Yes, ma'am.

1:00:35.097 --> 1:00:37.133
I won't shoot you.

1:00:37.166 --> 1:00:39.869
Can I stand?

1:00:39.902 --> 1:00:41.403
No.

1:00:41.436 --> 1:00:44.739
What's your name?

1:00:44.773 --> 1:00:47.108
You know my name.

1:00:47.141 --> 1:00:49.144
You're scared.

1:00:49.177 --> 1:00:51.012
Just think this through.

1:00:51.045 --> 1:00:52.045
Can you do that for me?

1:00:56.085 --> 1:00:58.287
Listen, mist.

1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:00.456
Just get the hell out of here.

1:01:00.489 --> 1:01:01.923
Turn yourself in.

1:01:01.956 --> 1:01:06.094
Serve your sentence for
assault. You kill me?

1:01:06.128 --> 1:01:09.231
And you will most certainly
spend the rest of your life

1:01:09.264 --> 1:01:10.264
in prison.

1:01:13.202 --> 1:01:16.472
Murder gets you life.

1:01:16.505 --> 1:01:17.773
I'm not an idiot.

1:01:17.806 --> 1:01:21.043
I'm going to turn around now.

1:01:21.076 --> 1:01:24.079
That's not a good idea
with a gun to your head.

1:01:24.112 --> 1:01:26.347
Take my chances.

1:01:26.380 --> 1:01:27.380
Don't.

1:01:36.324 --> 1:01:38.126
Who's this person you
think you murdered?

1:01:43.030 --> 1:01:45.900
I just wanted to scare him.

1:01:45.934 --> 1:01:48.269
And he had a heart
attack or something.

1:01:48.302 --> 1:01:51.373
Brian foley.

1:01:51.405 --> 1:01:54.844
Brian foley's alive.

1:01:54.876 --> 1:01:56.478
He was rushed to
the er this morning.

1:01:56.512 --> 1:01:58.815
Critical condition, but
he's going to pull through.

1:02:02.016 --> 1:02:04.753
I didn't kill him?

1:02:04.786 --> 1:02:05.786
No.

1:02:09.992 --> 1:02:11.472
I'm going to put
these on you now, ok?

1:02:16.297 --> 1:02:17.297
Turn around slowly.

1:02:28.210 --> 1:02:30.412
Place your hands on your...

1:02:30.445 --> 1:02:32.981
Behind your head.

1:02:33.014 --> 1:02:35.217
Now.

1:02:35.250 --> 1:02:36.250
Get on your knees.

1:02:48.831 --> 1:02:51.333
You pathetic little bug.

1:02:51.365 --> 1:02:53.835
You should have crushed me
when you had the chance.

1:02:56.572 --> 1:02:58.140
Boo!

1:02:58.172 --> 1:02:59.541
You're still a killer, Finn.

1:02:59.574 --> 1:03:01.309
And we both know it.

1:03:01.342 --> 1:03:02.811
What did you do to her?

1:03:02.844 --> 1:03:03.511
Suddenly you care?

1:03:03.545 --> 1:03:06.282
She was about to arrest you.

1:03:06.315 --> 1:03:08.050
You knew about foley.

1:03:08.083 --> 1:03:09.518
I know what the news tells me.

1:03:09.550 --> 1:03:12.253
What does that mean, really?

1:03:12.286 --> 1:03:14.923
Do you even remember
how you got here?

1:03:14.956 --> 1:03:16.257
I ran.

1:03:16.291 --> 1:03:17.291
And then what?

1:03:20.295 --> 1:03:21.230
I broke in.

1:03:21.262 --> 1:03:22.130
Ah, yes.

1:03:22.164 --> 1:03:24.166
And after a serious
blow to the brain,

1:03:24.199 --> 1:03:26.969
you managed to evade
helicopters and slipped

1:03:27.001 --> 1:03:29.337
into my decadent palace
through a back door which

1:03:29.371 --> 1:03:31.974
was conveniently unlocked.

1:03:32.007 --> 1:03:35.878
Finn, if it were entirely
up to me, I'd say screw it.

1:03:35.911 --> 1:03:37.179
Let me ravage you.

1:03:37.211 --> 1:03:39.480
But I can't do that.

1:03:39.514 --> 1:03:42.885
Everyone's got a boss.

1:03:42.918 --> 1:03:44.053
Help!

1:03:44.085 --> 1:03:50.225
There is a rule book I am
trying so hard not to break.

1:03:50.259 --> 1:03:52.894
Unfortunately, I
am not the author.

1:03:52.927 --> 1:03:56.397
Believe it or not, there are
higher beings than myself.

1:03:56.431 --> 1:03:59.869
Now, your world states that
no mass can move faster

1:03:59.902 --> 1:04:01.070
than the speed of light.

1:04:01.103 --> 1:04:04.005
It can come close, but that's
just a law of physics that

1:04:04.039 --> 1:04:05.341
cannot be broken.

1:04:05.373 --> 1:04:07.342
Well, the heavens and hell...

1:04:07.376 --> 1:04:11.914
We have our own laws for
life, death, and everything

1:04:11.947 --> 1:04:14.215
in between, like marriage.

1:04:14.248 --> 1:04:19.587
Rule number one,
the choice is yours.

1:04:19.621 --> 1:04:23.224
In other words, I can't
decide what happens to you.

1:04:23.257 --> 1:04:27.328
And actually, that
is the only rule.

1:04:27.362 --> 1:04:28.364
See?

1:04:28.396 --> 1:04:30.965
Blank page.

1:04:30.998 --> 1:04:35.471
So now I'm required,
unfortunately,

1:04:35.503 --> 1:04:37.338
to give you something
you probably

1:04:37.371 --> 1:04:40.675
feel you've never had before.

1:04:40.708 --> 1:04:43.444
Can you guess what that is?

1:04:43.478 --> 1:04:45.914
Going once.

1:04:45.947 --> 1:04:48.216
I said it just a moment ago.

1:04:48.250 --> 1:04:50.985
The answer is choice.

1:04:51.018 --> 1:04:54.088
So in case you are worried
about free will, do you have it?

1:04:54.121 --> 1:04:56.157
Is everything predetermined?

1:04:56.190 --> 1:05:00.161
Congratulations, you have it.

1:05:00.195 --> 1:05:03.432
It's really the only
thing you do have.

1:05:03.465 --> 1:05:08.704
And you've made some
terrible decisions.

1:05:08.737 --> 1:05:13.575
You're in this little
world of mine together.

1:05:13.608 --> 1:05:17.211
The only difference is
it's your soul that's

1:05:17.244 --> 1:05:19.280
being judged here today.

1:05:19.313 --> 1:05:22.717
And you've shown
some great potential.

1:05:22.751 --> 1:05:26.722
You could be so much more, Finn.

1:05:26.755 --> 1:05:27.289
This is a dream.

1:05:27.322 --> 1:05:29.157
This is not happening.

1:05:29.190 --> 1:05:30.692
No.

1:05:30.726 --> 1:05:31.360
Yes.

1:05:31.393 --> 1:05:32.061
It is.

1:05:32.094 --> 1:05:34.396
I mean, you can call it a dream.

1:05:34.429 --> 1:05:36.597
That's a weird way
of looking at it.

1:05:36.630 --> 1:05:41.170
I keep telling you you need
serious medical attention.

1:05:41.202 --> 1:05:43.972
With a car crash and the
firefight with the police,

1:05:44.005 --> 1:05:48.376
your brain is bruised and you've
got one foot out the door.

1:05:48.409 --> 1:05:52.748
So if you want to call a dream
anything out of the ordinary,

1:05:52.780 --> 1:05:55.650
fine, let's call it a dream.

1:05:55.684 --> 1:05:59.121
But real talk, this is
a million times closer

1:05:59.153 --> 1:06:01.422
to how things really are.

1:06:01.456 --> 1:06:04.760
This is where you either
find your will to live

1:06:04.793 --> 1:06:08.030
or you choose to
leave it all behind.

1:06:08.063 --> 1:06:12.233
Finn, just because I have this
whole free will spiel down,

1:06:12.266 --> 1:06:18.306
I don't want you to think that
I am some whore for souls.

1:06:18.340 --> 1:06:21.610
You are my favorite.

1:06:21.643 --> 1:06:25.380
Stay here with me, and I'll
guarantee that no one will ever

1:06:25.414 --> 1:06:28.684
control you again.

1:06:28.717 --> 1:06:30.987
I'll give you
everything you desire.

1:06:33.454 --> 1:06:34.454
Hey!

1:06:38.427 --> 1:06:40.362
Look familiar?

1:06:40.394 --> 1:06:42.163
Now, this over here...

1:06:42.197 --> 1:06:43.798
That's, where you broke in.

1:06:43.831 --> 1:06:50.438
And this is where you scared
that poor man to death.

1:06:50.472 --> 1:06:52.074
Hey!

1:06:52.106 --> 1:06:54.108
You still with me?

1:06:54.141 --> 1:06:56.811
Look, nobody arrives
at death's door

1:06:56.844 --> 1:06:59.380
with a completely open mind.

1:06:59.414 --> 1:07:01.583
It takes some adjusting.

1:07:01.615 --> 1:07:03.251
I do my best to ease you in.

1:07:03.284 --> 1:07:07.489
But at the end of the
day, it's still wonky.

1:07:07.521 --> 1:07:08.757
All this?

1:07:08.789 --> 1:07:11.559
Well, this is all you...

1:07:11.592 --> 1:07:16.731
Your memories, your
fears, just like a dream.

1:07:16.764 --> 1:07:18.666
Guess you have a thing
for insidious redheads.

1:07:18.699 --> 1:07:22.770
Finn rossi, suspect
of this morning's manhunt,

1:07:22.804 --> 1:07:26.075
was found alive,
although unconscious,

1:07:26.108 --> 1:07:28.443
along with officer
daughtery, veteran

1:07:28.476 --> 1:07:31.179
on the force, proud
mother of two.

1:07:31.213 --> 1:07:34.750
Our reps on the scene report
a struggle between daughtery

1:07:34.782 --> 1:07:37.286
and the suspect in
what can only be

1:07:37.318 --> 1:07:41.590
described as some sort of
standoff which ended poorly

1:07:41.623 --> 1:07:43.125
for them both.

1:07:43.157 --> 1:07:46.394
Our thoughts and prayers
are with officer daughtery,

1:07:46.427 --> 1:07:50.199
as we understand she is
in critical condition.

1:07:50.231 --> 1:07:55.269
But hey, let's face it,
she probably deserved it.

1:07:55.302 --> 1:07:59.307
I'm sure she'll burn in hell.

1:07:59.340 --> 1:08:02.577
Right, Finn?

1:08:02.610 --> 1:08:07.583
In case you're wondering,
you're not dead, yet.

1:08:07.615 --> 1:08:09.485
You're somewhere in between.

1:08:12.621 --> 1:08:14.289
That's for you to decide.

1:08:14.322 --> 1:08:17.426
She's here with you
somewhere in between.

1:08:17.458 --> 1:08:20.295
You shot her, she shot
you, it was a whole thing.

1:08:20.328 --> 1:08:22.231
And now every
second that goes by,

1:08:22.264 --> 1:08:26.168
you just get weaker
and weaker until...

1:08:26.201 --> 1:08:28.436
Bye bye.

1:08:28.470 --> 1:08:29.671
What do you want?

1:08:29.703 --> 1:08:33.474
Haven't you been listening?

1:08:33.507 --> 1:08:36.345
Or are you what
everyone says you are...

1:08:36.377 --> 1:08:41.215
A simple minded
albeit handsome fool?

1:08:41.248 --> 1:08:46.255
I want you to stay
here with us forever.

1:08:49.658 --> 1:08:52.194
Us?

1:08:52.226 --> 1:08:54.328
My girls.

1:08:54.362 --> 1:09:02.362
Ishtar, mania, sekhmet,
naiama, and yours truly,

1:09:07.341 --> 1:09:10.878
valavar, duchess
of the underworld,

1:09:10.912 --> 1:09:14.783
friend to the wayward,
lover of a good time.

1:09:14.815 --> 1:09:16.818
You can call me val.

1:09:16.850 --> 1:09:18.886
I'm not having a good time.

1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:23.324
You're not listening!

1:09:23.358 --> 1:09:25.827
We will take care of you.

1:09:25.859 --> 1:09:28.663
We'll give you everything
that Jenny wouldn't.

1:09:33.768 --> 1:09:35.971
I don't know where you
think you're going.

1:09:36.003 --> 1:09:37.939
Finn!

1:09:37.972 --> 1:09:39.541
Join the club!

1:09:42.344 --> 1:09:43.511
Touch me, Finn.

1:09:43.545 --> 1:09:44.680
Run your fingers through me.

1:09:44.712 --> 1:09:47.481
Do you even remember what's
waiting out there for you,

1:09:47.515 --> 1:09:48.317
Finn?

1:09:48.350 --> 1:09:49.318
God!

1:09:49.350 --> 1:09:50.152
When you arrived, you
were in so much pain.

1:09:50.185 --> 1:09:53.422
You were just a
scared little baby.

1:09:53.454 --> 1:09:55.323
Do you remember the last
time you were happy?

1:09:55.356 --> 1:09:58.359
Do you even remember what
that is, Finn, happiness?

1:09:58.393 --> 1:10:01.430
Well, it only gets
worse for you out there.

1:10:01.462 --> 1:10:04.766
You never have to go back!

1:10:57.652 --> 1:10:58.686
Hey, hey, hey.

1:11:01.789 --> 1:11:04.025
You're probably just nervous.

1:11:04.059 --> 1:11:05.394
The plan?

1:11:05.426 --> 1:11:06.862
Tonight?

1:11:06.895 --> 1:11:09.364
You're still good for it, right?

1:11:09.396 --> 1:11:10.731
Yeah?

1:11:10.765 --> 1:11:12.567
See?

1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:15.304
Coming back here wouldn't
change a damn thing.

1:11:15.337 --> 1:11:16.872
Cockroach!

1:11:22.944 --> 1:11:24.913
You never have to be like them.

1:11:24.945 --> 1:11:26.515
The ones outside?

1:11:26.547 --> 1:11:28.349
They never had a choice.

1:11:28.382 --> 1:11:29.318
Why me?

1:11:29.350 --> 1:11:32.820
You have demonstrated
complete commitment

1:11:32.854 --> 1:11:34.655
to the woman you love.

1:11:34.689 --> 1:11:37.826
For Jenny you are
willing to kill, steal,

1:11:37.859 --> 1:11:39.328
god knows what else.

1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:41.962
And that is the
type of commitment

1:11:41.996 --> 1:11:45.533
I have been searching for.

1:11:45.567 --> 1:11:47.601
Promise your soul to me, Finn.

1:11:47.635 --> 1:11:51.105
Commit yourself to me,
and you will be free.

1:11:51.139 --> 1:11:54.842
Things you don't even know
you want, I can give you.

1:11:54.876 --> 1:11:59.514
You'll never feel foolish
again, used, or manipulated.

1:11:59.546 --> 1:12:00.581
Now, come on.

1:12:00.614 --> 1:12:02.050
That's a hell of a proposal.

1:12:02.082 --> 1:12:04.685
You're out of your mind.

1:12:04.719 --> 1:12:06.887
Just say yes, man.

1:12:06.921 --> 1:12:08.623
I could use the company.

1:12:08.655 --> 1:12:12.094
Or say no and get 25 to life.

1:12:12.127 --> 1:12:14.129
Why the deliberation?

1:12:14.162 --> 1:12:17.099
I can give you
anything you want.

1:12:17.131 --> 1:12:19.634
I can summon anyone
from your life.

1:12:19.667 --> 1:12:22.137
Look who made it to the wedding.

1:12:22.170 --> 1:12:23.637
Finn.

1:12:23.671 --> 1:12:24.671
Mom?

1:12:27.542 --> 1:12:30.078
What are you doing here?

1:12:30.110 --> 1:12:31.546
Look down, Finn.

1:12:31.578 --> 1:12:34.515
You've got a lot on your plate.

1:12:34.548 --> 1:12:36.150
Ah...

1:12:36.184 --> 1:12:38.119
Where am I?

1:12:38.153 --> 1:12:39.153
Where's my body?

1:12:41.922 --> 1:12:43.759
You're under arrest!

1:12:43.792 --> 1:12:45.494
You're going to rot
in a cell, buddy.

1:12:45.527 --> 1:12:46.795
I'll make sure of it!

1:12:50.965 --> 1:12:52.934
She's in my head.

1:12:52.966 --> 1:12:53.467
It hurts.

1:12:53.501 --> 1:12:55.070
Please get her out.

1:12:55.103 --> 1:12:56.471
Please get her out of my head.

1:12:56.503 --> 1:12:57.706
Stop this.

1:12:57.738 --> 1:12:58.973
Cure me, Finn.

1:12:59.006 --> 1:13:00.841
Put me out of my misery.

1:13:00.875 --> 1:13:02.911
You'll never have
to go to prison.

1:13:02.944 --> 1:13:05.814
You'll never have to
face your old life again!

1:13:05.846 --> 1:13:08.416
Finn, look at this place.

1:13:08.449 --> 1:13:11.452
Isn't this what
you'd call luxury?

1:13:11.485 --> 1:13:14.655
You could stay here with us.

1:13:14.689 --> 1:13:18.593
Sure, it would feel new
and strange at first,

1:13:18.626 --> 1:13:19.961
but you'd adjust.

1:13:19.993 --> 1:13:24.064
Here, you'd be a god.

1:13:24.097 --> 1:13:25.833
You'd never age.

1:13:25.867 --> 1:13:28.837
You can have anything you want.

1:13:28.869 --> 1:13:30.771
Just the snap of your fingers.

1:13:32.506 --> 1:13:36.076
All you have to do is
take that holy Roman knife

1:13:36.109 --> 1:13:40.648
and drive it through her skull.

1:13:40.681 --> 1:13:45.653
Take her soul, and
I'll have yours.

1:13:45.686 --> 1:13:46.587
Please help me.

1:13:46.621 --> 1:13:48.489
Please help me!

1:13:48.523 --> 1:13:49.190
Come on, Finn.

1:13:49.224 --> 1:13:51.726
She's practically begging you.

1:13:51.759 --> 1:13:53.595
Finn!

1:13:53.627 --> 1:13:55.563
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

1:13:55.596 --> 1:13:56.364
Come on, Finn.

1:13:56.398 --> 1:13:58.567
She doesn't have
very much longer.

1:13:58.600 --> 1:13:59.601
Please, what's happening?

1:13:59.634 --> 1:14:00.935
It's me.

1:14:00.969 --> 1:14:01.569
Please.

1:14:01.603 --> 1:14:03.471
Please.

1:14:03.505 --> 1:14:05.239
No.

1:14:05.273 --> 1:14:06.775
I'm sorry?

1:14:06.807 --> 1:14:07.242
Kill me.

1:14:07.274 --> 1:14:08.076
Send me to hell.

1:14:08.109 --> 1:14:09.144
I don't give a shit.

1:14:09.176 --> 1:14:10.545
I'm not hurting anyone else.

1:14:10.578 --> 1:14:12.714
Don't be a fool, Finn!

1:14:12.747 --> 1:14:16.184
You're talking about a
head on a plate here.

1:14:16.216 --> 1:14:18.752
Out there you had no problem
shooting her in the gut.

1:14:18.786 --> 1:14:19.855
Now look at her.

1:14:19.887 --> 1:14:21.523
She's suffering.

1:14:21.555 --> 1:14:24.792
Finish what you started.

1:14:24.826 --> 1:14:29.997
If I kill her here, then
she's dead like forever, ever?

1:14:30.030 --> 1:14:30.798
That's how it works?

1:14:30.832 --> 1:14:33.101
I shot you, Finn!

1:14:33.134 --> 1:14:36.538
You ran, and I shot you
right through the arm!

1:14:36.570 --> 1:14:38.806
I'm not your pal.

1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:41.109
She was aiming for your chest.

1:14:41.141 --> 1:14:45.746
She wants to lock you
up, put you away forever.

1:14:45.779 --> 1:14:48.716
Because of her, you'll
never have a life again.

1:14:48.750 --> 1:14:50.886
Don't be a little bitch.

1:14:50.918 --> 1:14:52.287
Kill me.

1:14:52.319 --> 1:14:53.921
Kill...

1:14:53.954 --> 1:14:55.789
Please help me, please.

1:14:55.823 --> 1:14:56.356
Please.

1:14:56.390 --> 1:14:57.726
Don't... please help me.

1:14:57.759 --> 1:14:58.827
Do it.

1:14:58.859 --> 1:15:02.530
Do as I say, and no one
will ever control you again.

1:15:02.564 --> 1:15:05.734
Commit to me, and we
will rule together.

1:15:08.670 --> 1:15:10.739
Send me back.

1:15:10.771 --> 1:15:12.239
Oh, Finn.

1:15:12.273 --> 1:15:16.144
You have a history of
making some bad decisions.

1:15:16.176 --> 1:15:17.177
Send me back!

1:15:19.079 --> 1:15:20.314
Do this, Finn.

1:15:20.347 --> 1:15:21.850
Send me back!

1:15:21.882 --> 1:15:25.052
Send me back!

1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:43.571
Oh, Finn.

1:15:43.604 --> 1:15:49.977
It was so nice spending
this time with you.

1:15:55.917 --> 1:15:58.887
PC daughtery, 296 to dispatch.

1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:01.855
We have that suspect cornered
behind dock auto on depot.

1:16:01.889 --> 1:16:03.792
He's badly injured,
possible head trauma.

1:16:03.824 --> 1:16:04.658
Requesting medical.

1:16:04.692 --> 1:16:07.261
Over.

1:16:07.295 --> 1:16:07.828
Hey, hey!

1:16:07.862 --> 1:16:09.264
Hands behind your back.

1:16:09.296 --> 1:16:10.296
Now!

1:16:14.368 --> 1:16:14.969
All right.

1:16:15.002 --> 1:16:16.002
Stand up.

1:16:16.170 --> 1:16:17.005
D, you good?

1:16:17.037 --> 1:16:18.037
Yeah.

1:16:20.742 --> 1:16:23.211
You seen this guy before.

1:16:23.243 --> 1:16:23.944
I don't know.

1:16:23.978 --> 1:16:31.219
