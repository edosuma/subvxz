I-I know.
I'm not.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.100
My dad sent me down
to his car

00:13.143 --> 00:14.710
to get the coffees
he bought for us.

00:14.753 --> 00:15.972
Oh.
Who's your dad?

00:16.016 --> 00:17.321
- Steve Miller.
- Property Crimes?

00:17.365 --> 00:19.323
Yeah.
T-That's him.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.064
We don't, uh, get to see
each other too often

00:21.108 --> 00:22.196
since the divorce.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.111
Mom got full custody.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.896
So he makes me stop by
the station

00:26.939 --> 00:29.681
for some "father-son"
coffee time before school.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.074
Oh. That's nice.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.425
After you.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.427

00:42.172 --> 00:45.088
Uh, yeah. Yeah.
Thanks.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.613
Yeah.
Divorce is tough.

00:48.657 --> 00:51.660
I have a son a few years older
than you.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.010
I remember when his mom and I
split up,

00:54.054 --> 00:56.360
I wanted to do everything
I could just to show him

00:56.404 --> 00:58.884
that I would still
be there for him.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.452
You know, still be Dad.

01:01.496 --> 01:04.455
I'm sure your father's just
trying to do the same for you.

01:04.499 --> 01:05.891
Yeah.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.763
And this is my stop.

01:07.806 --> 01:09.504
Nice to meet you.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.332
Uh, you, too.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.942
Oh.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.205
Just wanted to say
thank you for the pep talk.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.164
I -- I needed it.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.904
No problem.

01:27.739 --> 01:30.046
We need to figure out
how he got access to the roof.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.961
Okay.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.789
Hey.
What's happening?

01:33.832 --> 01:35.443
Someone stole
a police helicopter.

01:35.486 --> 01:36.835
What?
Nolan.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.402
Sir, I just heard about
the airship.

01:38.446 --> 01:39.882
Do you know
- who took it?
- No.

Sir, in Nolan's defense,
a teenager stealing

02:01.382 --> 02:04.298
a police helicopter --
it's highly unexpected behavior.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.734
We're cops.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.953
"Highly unexpected"
is what we do before breakfast.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.433
Hey, kid,
I know you can hear me.

02:09.477 --> 02:12.132
See, right now I have the FBI,
Homeland Security,

02:12.175 --> 02:14.525
and the DOD
blowing up my phone,

02:14.569 --> 02:16.136
and they're all saying
the same thing --

02:16.179 --> 02:18.877
we should launch fighter jets
and blow you out of the sky.

good as new.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.074
Listen here, boy, I --If I may.

02:45.252 --> 02:48.385
Hey. This is John Nolan,
from the elevator.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.126
Hey! Yeah, yeah.
The divorced dad.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.911

02:55.827 --> 02:57.699
Yes. Thank you.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.919
Listen, we know Steve Miller's
not really your father,

03:00.963 --> 03:02.225
so why don't you tell us
who you really are

03:02.269 --> 03:03.879
and what you want?

03:03.922 --> 03:07.187
<i>Who I really am</i> <i>
is the hero of my own story.</i>

03:07.230 --> 03:10.494

03:10.538 --> 03:11.930
<i>Whoa!</i>

03:11.974 --> 03:13.410
What is it?
What happened?

03:15.934 --> 03:19.373

03:19.416 --> 03:21.592

03:30.297 --> 03:32.386
No, no, wait,
wait, wait.

03:32.429 --> 03:33.691
Hero?

03:33.735 --> 03:36.041
Okay, uh,
do we believe him?

03:36.085 --> 03:38.827
I mean, he seemed like
a sweet kid on the elevator.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.263
He's not talking like
he's planning on

03:40.307 --> 03:41.612
doing anything violent.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.310
And he's right.
They won't shoot him down

03:43.353 --> 03:44.876
unless he poses
an imminent threat.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.705
So, how do we get him down
with no casualties?

03:47.749 --> 03:49.446
We got four hours
to figure that out.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.318
That's how much fuel
he's got left.

03:51.361 --> 03:54.451
Nolan, get out there and
shadow him the best you can.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.714
Can I take Lucy with me?
She'll help me get in his head.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.455
Okay. Good idea.

03:58.499 --> 04:01.632
And, Nolan, get him to land
before gravity does it for him.

04:01.676 --> 04:03.504
Yes, sir.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.335
Hey. You ready to roll?

04:08.378 --> 04:10.902
Oh. Actually, Grey assigned me
to ride with Nolan

04:10.946 --> 04:12.208
to trail helicopter kid.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.470
Alright. Let me know
if you need anything.

04:13.514 --> 04:14.993
Mm-hmm.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.867
Hey. Guess who's sitting
in a holding cell right now?

04:18.910 --> 04:20.216
Yeah.
I don't do guessing games.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.870
Your old friend,
Dez Robinson.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.872
What'd he do?
Cabot and Lodge
pulled him over

04:23.915 --> 04:25.352
for a traffic violation.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.223
They found a diamond bracelet
in his car that was taken

04:27.267 --> 04:29.356
during a home invasion
that left a family dead.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.748
That triple murder
in Larchmont Village?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.533
Yeah. I'm about to go
question him. You want in?

04:32.576 --> 04:34.230
Bet your ass I do.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.058
I'm surprised you've stayed out
of prison for this long,

04:36.101 --> 04:37.799
given that you're dumb enough
to drive around

04:37.842 --> 04:40.454
with stolen property
when you're still on probation.

04:40.497 --> 04:44.022
The bracelet was stolen?
I had no idea.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.502
I-I bought it
from a pawnshop

04:45.546 --> 04:47.461
to give to my mother
for her -- her birthday.

04:47.504 --> 04:50.986
- Yeah, which pawnshop?
- Man, I don't remember that.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.467
I went to like nine of them
you know,

04:53.510 --> 04:55.817
looking for
the perfect gift.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.906
- I love my mom.
- Do you have the receipt?

04:57.949 --> 04:59.516
No.
I don't believe in them.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.693
Thing is, Dez, that bracelet
wasn't just stolen.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.739
It was taken from
a home invasion two nights ago,

05:04.782 --> 05:06.306
where three people
were killed.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.524
And we believe the same crew
is responsible

05:07.568 --> 05:09.352
for two other home invasion
murders.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.875
Oh, wow.
You guys really
don't like

05:10.919 --> 05:12.181
to leave any witnesses,
do you?

05:12.224 --> 05:13.748
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.359
Really. I-I was at work
two nights ago.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.361
Just check with my boss.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.494
Oh, I will.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.670
Look, Dez...

05:22.713 --> 05:26.630
you and I --
we go way back, right?

05:26.674 --> 05:28.197
The joy of recidivism.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.765
And while you've never been
afraid of a little violence,

05:30.808 --> 05:32.462
you're not a killer.

05:32.506 --> 05:35.422
So I don't think you'd shoot
that family in cold blood.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.380
No. I think you hooked up
with this crew

05:37.424 --> 05:39.817
not knowing they were killers,
and now you're tied to them.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.080
If you tell us who they are,
we can make a deal.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.344
If not, we hang the murders
around your neck

05:44.387 --> 05:46.520
with the rest of your crew,
and you'll die in prison.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.043
All we need is a name.

05:52.264 --> 05:53.744
Adrienne Mount.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.094
Adrienne Mount
committed the murders?

05:56.138 --> 05:58.227
No.
She's my lawyer.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.490
I'd like to
talk to her, please.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.970
Are you wearing makeup?

06:02.013 --> 06:05.495
What?
No.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.192
Okay, yeah.

06:07.236 --> 06:10.152
Um... I thought that
I got that off.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.197
Hmm.
Yeah. We had
a late-night shoot

06:12.241 --> 06:16.027
at Club Avalon
for my reality show pilot.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.639
How exactly does partying
at a nightclub

06:18.682 --> 06:20.423
reset the world's image
of you?

06:20.467 --> 06:21.685
Well, no.
We were, like, you know,

06:21.729 --> 06:23.208
shooting the reenactments
of, like,

06:23.252 --> 06:24.993
what my life was like
before the murder.

06:25.036 --> 06:26.690
Which, actually,
was pretty cool.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.300
Listen, Hollywood,

06:28.344 --> 06:30.041
I will put up with
this reality show

06:30.085 --> 06:32.348
as long as it helps
to clear your name.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.133
But if it starts to affect
your performance --

06:35.177 --> 06:36.526
It won't, okay?
I swear.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.833
And, look, I couldn't be
any less "Hollywood."

06:38.876 --> 06:40.965
Mr. Thorsen.
Good morning, sir.

06:41.009 --> 06:42.402
I got you
your breakfast.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.055
Who are you?

06:44.099 --> 06:45.666
Kenton Scott,
Mr. Thorsen's assistant.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.842
Uh, no.

06:47.885 --> 06:50.192
I mean, yes, but he's only
supposed to be assisting me

06:50.235 --> 06:51.367
when I'm working on
the show.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.021
And right now,
I'm at my real job.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.370
And I'm still
on probation,

06:54.414 --> 06:56.459
so I need you to go now,
okay?

06:56.503 --> 06:58.156
No.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.506
W-What do you mean, no?
You work for me.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.203
Uh, technically,
I work for your mother.

07:01.246 --> 07:04.119
And she...scares the hell
outta me.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.295
I-In the best way.
She's amazing. I love her.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.558
But if I make a mistake, she'll
catapult me into the sun,

07:08.602 --> 07:10.865
so I'm here for you
24/7.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.433
So should I ride with you,
or just follow in my car?

07:13.476 --> 07:14.782
Probably my car,
so I can run errands if you --

07:14.825 --> 07:17.698
Kenton, Kenton, Kenton,
take a breath.

07:17.741 --> 07:20.527
Okay? Uh, assistants
get lunch, right?

07:20.570 --> 07:21.919
Yes. Absolutely.

07:21.963 --> 07:25.053
Okay. I'm having
this wild pregnancy craving

07:25.096 --> 07:26.881
for some, uh,
bulgogi tacos.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.230
Great, I'm sure I can find that
around here --

07:28.273 --> 07:30.188
Yeah. But not just
any bulgogi tacos.

07:30.232 --> 07:33.191
They have to be from
Apollo Yang's food truck,

07:33.235 --> 07:35.542
which is parked at
a different location every day.

07:35.585 --> 07:38.022
And the only way
to obtain that location

07:38.066 --> 07:40.198
is to text
a secret password

07:40.242 --> 07:44.246
to a specific short code,
which... I don't have.

07:45.639 --> 07:46.944
On it.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.556
Yeah.
That'll keep him busy.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.427
I'm so sorry. That --
That won't happen again.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.733
I'mma talk to my mom
about that, okay?

07:52.776 --> 07:54.256
Mm-hmm.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.040
You alright?
Yeah. I think so.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.869
I just got uncomfortable
all of a sudden.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.392
It's the baby?
I don't know.

08:00.436 --> 08:03.744
Um, maybe we should,
um, stop by my OB's office

08:03.787 --> 08:06.050
at the hospital,
just to make sure.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.443
Okay.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.141
Alright.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.673
Oh. They ID'd 'copter kid.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.718
Leo Thomas, age 17.

08:21.762 --> 08:22.850
No priors.

08:22.893 --> 08:23.894
Grey's reaching out
to the family.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.679
Clearly,
there's trouble there.

08:25.722 --> 08:28.246
Well-adjusted kids don't steal
police helicopters.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.552
I mean, it could
be classic

08:29.596 --> 08:31.380
teenage attention-seeking
behavior.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.469
You know, trying to stand out,
establish their identity.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.079
The whole thing's gotten
exponentially worse

08:35.123 --> 08:36.559
since social media.

08:36.603 --> 08:39.214
Dying your hair is classic
attention seeking.

08:39.257 --> 08:42.391
Stealing a police helicopter
is extremely dangerous.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.959
Teenagers don't have
fully formed brains.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.309
They don't perceive risk
in the same ways that we do.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.615
You remember that age.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.051
I remember working
two part-time jobs

08:50.094 --> 08:52.357
- to save up for college.
- You never acted out?

08:52.401 --> 08:54.142
Not in
any substantial way.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.752
Well --

08:55.796 --> 08:57.667
You know, I don't know why
I'm surprised.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.451
Oh, like you were
such a rebel.

08:59.495 --> 09:03.194
I'm --
You have no idea.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.418
- Hello?
- How's Harper doing?

09:09.461 --> 09:10.680
Still waiting to hear,
sir,

09:10.724 --> 09:12.029
but the doctor
didn't seem worried.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.336
Good.
Keep me updated.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.381
In the meantime, I have
an assignment for you.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.992
Yes, sir.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.733
A riot broke out at
Men's Correctional this morning.

09:19.776 --> 09:22.518
<i>There were dozens injured and</i> <i>
one prisoner airlifted to Shaw</i>

09:22.562 --> 09:25.695
for emergency surgery --
Langston Bryant.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.089
So I need you to relieve
the sheriff's deputy

09:28.132 --> 09:29.220
that accompanied him.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.700
<i>And, Thorsen --</i>
Sir?

09:30.744 --> 09:33.398
Langston's 18 years into
a life sentence

09:33.442 --> 09:34.661
for killing a cop

09:34.704 --> 09:36.358
<i>for a routine</i> <i>
traffic stop.</i>

09:36.401 --> 09:38.534
<i>He did it once, he could</i> <i>
certainly do it again.</i>

09:38.578 --> 09:39.796
Watch yourself.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.189
Yes, sir.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.147
Nurse Howard to 2 West, please.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.846
Hey, I'm here
to relieve you.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.065
Great. I gotta get back
to the prison.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.024
Damn, man,
are you okay?

09:50.067 --> 09:52.722
Not even close.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.682
The prisoner in there --
he's as dangerous as they come,

09:55.725 --> 09:58.380
so be smart.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.556
Yes, sir.
I've been briefed.

10:09.086 --> 10:12.699
Good morning, Los Angeles!

10:12.742 --> 10:16.398
This is Airship Three coming to
you live and in the sky.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.574
Looks like there's gonna be
traffic on...

10:18.618 --> 10:20.010
all of the roads.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.359
And I'm actually taking a poll

10:21.403 --> 10:23.361
about where I should go
patrol next.

10:23.405 --> 10:26.016
Um, you know, I-I could take
a trip over to Santa Monica,

10:26.060 --> 10:28.323
maybe see what'll be underwater
when all the glaciers melt.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.020
Hey, there, Leo.
Divorced Dad here.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.153
- How's it going up there?
- Me? Can't complain.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.850
You know where the bathroom is
in this thing?

10:33.894 --> 10:37.854
Listen, Leo -- what you are
doing is really dangerous.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.335
Your family is worried sick
about you.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.206
Yeah,
that's not gonna work

10:42.250 --> 10:43.860
and I'm disappointed
you thought it would.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.209
<i>So, see ya.</i>

10:45.253 --> 10:47.864
Look. Wait. Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on. Just --

10:47.908 --> 10:50.171
Did you really learn to fly
from video games?

10:50.214 --> 10:53.174
And a few
ClipTalk tutorials.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.438
Ugh.
Wow. That's --

10:56.481 --> 10:58.048
Hats off, man. Wow.
I mean, I --

10:58.092 --> 11:00.834
I love me some video games,
but that's --

11:00.877 --> 11:02.400
You know, uh,
"Breath of the Wild"

11:02.444 --> 11:04.838
consumed my life
for about four months.

11:04.881 --> 11:08.102
I beat Ganon -- twice. <i>Impressive.</i>

11:08.145 --> 11:10.365
I-I bet you're feeling a little
bit like Link and his glider,

11:10.408 --> 11:12.062
flying around up there,
don't you?

11:12.106 --> 11:13.542
A little, yeah.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.849
But even Link couldn't fly
forever, right?

11:15.892 --> 11:18.460
He had to land sometime,
save Zelda, right?

11:18.503 --> 11:21.550
That's right.
The hero always has a purpose.

11:21.593 --> 11:24.509
Great. We're gonna find you
a nice, open place to land.

11:24.553 --> 11:27.425
<i>And he can also use help</i> <i>
from his allies.</i>

11:27.469 --> 11:29.079
Are you an ally,
Mr. Nolan?

11:31.778 --> 11:32.996
Yes, I am.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.389
<i>Great.</i> <i>
So here's the deal.</i>

11:34.432 --> 11:38.523
In order to help me complete
my hero's journey...

11:38.567 --> 11:40.308
I need you to complete
three quests.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.399
If you succeed,
I'll give myself up.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.449
This is not
a video game, Leo.

11:51.493 --> 11:52.842
No.
It's something deeper.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.192
Games, fantasy novels,
they're all built on

11:55.236 --> 11:58.718
the same architecture --
the hero's journey.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.590
<i>A universal story</i> <i>
so central to our identities,</i>

12:01.633 --> 12:03.287
<i>it's as if it's written</i> <i>
in our DNA.</i>

12:03.331 --> 12:05.246
He's been reading
Joseph Campbell.
Ah.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.031
You're the mentor --
an older, wiser figure

12:08.075 --> 12:10.555
like an Obi-Wan
or a Dumbledore.

12:10.599 --> 12:13.602
They usually die towards
the end...

12:13.645 --> 12:15.473
...to signify the hero's true
coming into himself.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.040
Who knows?
Maybe you'll pull through.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.650
Leo, this isn't a myth.

12:18.694 --> 12:22.611
This is real life,
and you are in real danger.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.005
I can't play along with
this quest nonsense.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.354
Why not?

12:26.397 --> 12:27.834
Why not slay dragons
for a kid

12:27.877 --> 12:30.924
I think is
increasingly delusional?

12:30.967 --> 12:33.317
Look, often the best way --
the only way

12:33.361 --> 12:36.625
to deal with people
who are in a crisis situation

12:36.668 --> 12:38.845
is to accept
their reality.

12:38.888 --> 12:41.021
I mean, it's either this
or we drive around all day,

12:41.064 --> 12:42.544
looking up.

12:45.547 --> 12:48.202
Alright.
What are the quests?

12:48.245 --> 12:50.030
I'm not gonna give you
all of them up front.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.335
It doesn't work that way.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.686
What do we have
to lose?

12:54.730 --> 12:56.776
Lives?
A helicopter?

12:59.169 --> 13:01.693
Fine. What is
the first quest?

13:06.394 --> 13:08.178
Okay. 9412 Orange.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.701
It's been empty
for over a year.

13:09.745 --> 13:13.836
Persistent 911 calls
about drug activity.

<i>This is a quest</i> <i>

a market and they moved in.

13:30.113 --> 13:33.377
<i>They started selling</i> <i>
some hardcore drugs,</i>

13:33.421 --> 13:38.208
and a raven-haired girl
OD'd.

13:38.252 --> 13:42.778
A young princess the hero
liked from afar.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.258
<i>You can't save the princess,</i>

13:44.301 --> 13:46.216

- For now.

16:04.267 --> 16:07.053
We're just trying to make sure
he doesn't hurt himself,

16:07.096 --> 16:08.968
or others.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.361
So he hasn't
contacted you?

16:11.405 --> 16:15.017
No. He wasn't there this morning
when I got home.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.193
I work graveyard.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.587
I called and texted,
but he never responded.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.067
Is that typical
for your son?

16:21.110 --> 16:24.244
Things have been tough for him
ever since...

16:25.245 --> 16:27.725
Go on.
You can say it.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.991
Since his father passed.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.080
Guy was a deadbeat
while he was alive.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.516

he's a superhero.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.998
Brian --No, I'm sorry.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.217
I try to do right
by that kid.

16:41.261 --> 16:44.090
We both do,
but he makes it impossible.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.656
He barely talks to us.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.050
He spends all of his time
reading these fantasy books,

16:48.094 --> 16:50.052
playing video games.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.447
Did manage to get himself
kicked out of school.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.710
Leo's not in school?

16:55.753 --> 16:58.887
I teach him at home.

16:58.930 --> 17:04.066
It's -- It's just hard,
uh, with my hours.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.158
I'm always tired.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.728
I can't lose him.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.991
And then after my conviction,
I found out

17:16.035 --> 17:17.514
that there were
two eyewitnesses,

17:17.558 --> 17:19.516
both who said the killer
was a short bald guy

17:19.560 --> 17:20.996
who looked
nothing like me.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.519
Okay. So, where was your lawyer
on all this?

17:22.563 --> 17:24.304
Drunk off his ass.

17:24.347 --> 17:27.089
Court appointed,
and he couldn't give a damn.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.351
Now you see
what I'm saying?

17:28.395 --> 17:29.831
Look, you need to file
for a retrial.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.398
I mean,
that's what I did.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.095
I don't have
your kind of money, my brother,

17:33.139 --> 17:36.359
and I can't get a lawyer
to take me on pro bono.

17:36.403 --> 17:37.839
I'm sorry.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.884
I don't need your sorry,

17:39.928 --> 17:43.366
but I could use
your help.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.977
You did two years for
a crime you didn't commit --

17:46.021 --> 17:48.328
I'm going on 18.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.025
Officer,
you have to wait out here.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.767
Surgery should take an hour.
There's no other exits.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.861
Hey.
Hey.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.341
Is everything okay?
Uh, yeah.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.169
Ultrasound came back clear.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.996
Doctor thinks that it was
just some heartburn.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.695
So, they're gonna run some
blood tests just to be safe.

18:07.738 --> 18:10.176
He getting his shattered arm
set?

18:10.219 --> 18:12.091
Yeah.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.222
What's wrong?

18:16.225 --> 18:17.792
I think
he could be innocent.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.359
Don't even go there.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.795
Look, he talked to me about
his case, and I think --

18:20.838 --> 18:22.449
Who told you to talk to him?
That's not your job.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.146
He is a cop killer, okay?

18:24.190 --> 18:27.236
So just shut up
and guard him, okay?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.064
Bulgogi tacos.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.719
I didn't know what style
you liked, so I got two of each.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.721
Kenton, how did
you find these?

18:33.764 --> 18:35.940
I tapped into
the LA assistant hive mind.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.899
The truck was on location
in Santa Clarita

18:37.942 --> 18:39.161
serving a movie crew.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.424
I drove over,
put on my headset,

18:41.468 --> 18:43.339
and walked right up
like I was part of the crew.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.254
So your tacos are courtesy
of the director

18:45.298 --> 18:47.343
of "
Part Three".

18:47.387 --> 18:48.910
- Damn, you are good.
- Mm-hmm.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.086
No. I'm the best.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.435
Oh.
Ooh!

18:52.479 --> 18:54.698
Hmm. Cocky, too.
Alright. I like that.

18:54.742 --> 18:59.616
But what I have for you now
is -- it's next level.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.444
Are you up for it?

19:01.488 --> 19:03.185
Bring it, Detective.

19:03.229 --> 19:07.189
Alright, um, I have been looking
for this doll

19:07.233 --> 19:09.148
that I had when
I was a little girl,

19:09.191 --> 19:10.671
to give to my daughter.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.368
But I can't remember
what it was called,

19:12.412 --> 19:14.718
and I haven't been able to
find it anywhere.

19:14.762 --> 19:17.591
But she was the first doll
that I ever saw

19:17.634 --> 19:20.942
that had hair and skin tone
that was just like mine.

19:20.985 --> 19:24.467
And she had this, um,
French-sounding name

19:24.511 --> 19:28.993
with a pink parasol --
or was it yellow?

19:29.907 --> 19:32.388
I'm on it.
Watch me do my thing.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.129
What?

19:36.262 --> 19:38.089
Here.
I-I can't have these.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.143
Hey.
So, Grey talked to Leo's mom.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.189
His home life
sounds like a real mess.

19:50.232 --> 19:53.453
His parents aren't divorced.
His father died two years ago.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.672
That's rough.
Hey. Here's
the weird thing --

19:55.716 --> 19:58.066
he's been homeschooled
for over a year.

19:58.109 --> 19:59.589
So he was making up
that whole story

19:59.633 --> 20:01.635
about the princess classmate
who OD'd?

20:01.678 --> 20:03.767
I don't know.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.510
Okay, Leo.
Quest one complete.

20:07.554 --> 20:10.296
How about we call this a victory
and you land?

20:10.339 --> 20:13.603
The hero's journey never ends
after the first quest.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.606
I was afraid you'd say that.
What's next?

20:16.650 --> 20:19.348
You're a gamer. You know
it's not all easy stuff.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.045
Eventually you get to
a boss battle.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.178
<i>A great beast you will struggle</i> <i>
to defeat.</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:25.049
Leo, how about we cut out
the windup

20:25.093 --> 20:26.834
and you just go straight
for the pitch?

20:26.877 --> 20:28.923
How do you feel about
alligators?

20:33.014 --> 20:34.494
Hey.
- Thanks for coming in.
- Yeah.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.147
I just want to verify
- a few things.
- Mm-hmm.

20:36.191 --> 20:39.281
Uh, Dez Robinson -- he works
for you, is that correct?

20:39.325 --> 20:40.804
From time to time.
Yeah.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.503
Okay. He said he worked
two nights ago.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.331
Yeah,
sounds about right.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.247
We had a construction job
down in Hawthorne.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.205
Picked up the night shift
for a few extra bucks.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.295
Any chance he checked
in and then maybe ducked
out for a few hours?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.863
Nah, I was there.
I would've seen that.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.778
You sure?

20:57.821 --> 21:01.825
Because, uh, Dez is suspected
in a triple murder

21:01.869 --> 21:04.045
that happened that night,
so anyone who helps him

21:04.088 --> 21:05.916
would be considered
an accessory.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.092
Hey. Hold on.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.268
I had no idea about that.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.052
I want no parts of that,
alright?

21:11.095 --> 21:12.575
I thought he was just out here
cheating on his girlfriend.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.273
I didn't know he was out here
killing people.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.752
Does that mean you want to
amend your statement?

21:15.796 --> 21:18.233
Hell yeah.
I'm gonna amend my statement.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.062
Dez paid me 500 bucks
to clock him in

21:21.105 --> 21:22.759
on the nights
that he needed an alibi.

21:22.803 --> 21:25.284
Okay. So, to be clear,
Dez did <i>not</i> show up to work

21:25.327 --> 21:26.850
- two nights ago?
- Right.

21:26.894 --> 21:30.854
Oh, and...
he paid me yesterday

21:30.898 --> 21:32.639
to clock him in
for tonight.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.338
Hey. Dez's alibi
fell apart.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.861
Nice work.
So when his lawyer lands,

21:37.905 --> 21:39.515
here's the plan --We don't have time
for a plan.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.212
The crew has another target
lined up for tonight.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.388
If we don't figure out
where they're hitting,

21:42.431 --> 21:43.563
they're gonna drop
more bodies.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.353
Let's never
do that again.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.963
You're gonna need
a much bigger leash than that.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.792
And tranquilizers, lot --
lots of tranquilizers.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.446
Cupcake is a sweetheart.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.275
Cupcake ate my Taser.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.190
Thank you.
Okay, Leo.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.366
Quest two is complete.
Funny coincidence --

22:04.410 --> 22:08.196
aside from a reptile
straight out of "Jurassic Park",

22:08.239 --> 22:10.372
we found a bunch of fentanyl
in the house.

22:10.416 --> 22:13.157
Two quests.
Two drug arrests.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.681
We're starting to sense
a pattern here.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.770
Alligator guy had drugs?

22:16.813 --> 22:18.511
It's a good thing
you caught him.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.904
Do you wanna tell us what these
quests are really about?

22:20.948 --> 22:22.471
- Not right now.
- Leo --

22:22.515 --> 22:24.473
Relax. You'll get
your third quest soon enough.

22:34.091 --> 22:36.659
Officer Webb.
Find anything?

22:36.703 --> 22:38.574
The stuff of nightmares.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.184
Man lives like a pig.

22:40.228 --> 22:41.534
So no gun?

22:41.577 --> 22:42.839
Nah.

22:42.883 --> 22:44.232
We need more leverage.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.494
Something that ties this guy

22:45.538 --> 22:47.061
definitively to the home
invasions.

22:47.104 --> 22:50.369
The only way we stop this crew
in time is if Dez flips.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.413
What have you searched
so far?

22:51.457 --> 22:52.980
We're going full
DEAR system.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.634
You're off
to a good start.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.636
Eliminating things
we don't have to search again.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.420
What's next?

22:58.464 --> 22:59.682
You know
what F.S.T.s are?

22:59.726 --> 23:01.249
Yeah,
Field Sobriety Tests.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.685
Yeah,
and when searching a house,

23:02.729 --> 23:04.339
F.S.T. stands for
something else.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.167
First, you get all the guys
from the outside

23:06.210 --> 23:08.343
to come search inside,
and vice versa.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.997
Fresh set of eyes.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.215
Alright?

23:11.259 --> 23:13.000
L-100, I need all units
from the outside

23:13.043 --> 23:15.089
to come inside
for a sec.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.786
Then you do
a Systematic grid search.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.658
Ah. So Systematic search
is the "S."

23:18.701 --> 23:21.225
What's the "T"?

23:21.269 --> 23:22.575
Alright, everyone,
listen up.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.315
I want everyone
who was searching outside

23:24.359 --> 23:26.143
to swap with people
on the inside.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.797
Then I want
a three-foot search grid.

23:27.841 --> 23:29.625
And there's
a $100 gift card

23:29.669 --> 23:31.410
for the first officer
who finds evidence

23:31.453 --> 23:32.933
linking this guy to
our 2-11.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.717
Got it?
Alright, let's go!

23:36.719 --> 23:38.678
The "T" is for
Treat it like a contest.

23:38.721 --> 23:41.158
Cops love to compete,
and they'll push themselves

23:41.202 --> 23:42.943
even harder if they know
there's something to win.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.646
What are you doing here?

23:50.690 --> 23:53.693
Um, why didn't you tell me
you were seeing your OB?

23:53.736 --> 23:56.347
I-I didn't want to worry you
if it was nothing,

23:56.391 --> 23:57.566
and -- and it was.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.220
It was just a little
aggressive heartburn.

23:59.263 --> 24:00.482
I don't care.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.441
If you burp funny,
I wanna know.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.489
He called you here,
didn't he?

24:07.533 --> 24:08.925
And it wasn't about me.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.711
Yes, ma'am. I, um --
I called them about Langston.

24:13.452 --> 24:18.761
Are you trying to get everyone
in the LAPD to hate you?

24:18.805 --> 24:20.589
Because that is
what is gonna happen

24:20.633 --> 24:23.505
if you advocate
for a convicted cop killer.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.681
I told you to drop this.

24:25.725 --> 24:28.684
All due respect, if there is
even a sliver of a chance

24:28.728 --> 24:30.599
that he is innocent,
it needs to be investigated.

24:30.643 --> 24:33.123
Yeah, look.
That hardcore dude in there

24:33.167 --> 24:36.039
is unrecognizable from the guy
that went in 18 years ago.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.781
He's been institutionalized.
I've seen it a thousand times.

24:40.914 --> 24:44.134
A nice haircut and a cute smile
does not mean he is innocent.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.310
Yeah, and a conviction doesn't
mean that he's guilty, either.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.399
I mean, I'm proof of that.

24:48.443 --> 24:49.531
If I'd have stayed
in prison,

24:49.575 --> 24:51.011
that's how
I would've ended up.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.491
And now that I have
a platform

24:52.534 --> 24:53.883
to help people
who are wrongfully accused,

24:53.927 --> 24:55.232
I mean, I have to use it.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.800
I thought you were trying to
"rebrand" yourself.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.846
To -- To reclaim
your identity

24:59.889 --> 25:01.804
separate from
your conviction.

25:01.848 --> 25:04.851
If you tie yourself to Langston,
you will undo all of that.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.766
Alright, look,
there is no reason

25:06.809 --> 25:08.463
to go right to
the worst-case scenario.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.465
Let James and I
talk to him,

25:10.509 --> 25:12.554
just see what kind of
impression we get.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.730
Just to see
if there's any merit.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.215
Alright.
You got 15 minutes.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.651
Okay.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.224
Still waiting on
that third quest, Leo.

25:30.267 --> 25:33.923
Unless you want to just skip it
and land?

25:33.967 --> 25:35.490
You still up there, Leo?

25:35.534 --> 25:38.667
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here,
just enjoying the view.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.190
It's peaceful up here.

25:40.234 --> 25:41.278
You know, we did
a little digging

25:41.322 --> 25:42.932
after our last conversation.

25:42.976 --> 25:44.673
Turns out Murray,
the guy with the alligator,

25:44.717 --> 25:47.720
one of his known associates
is Brian Johst,

25:47.763 --> 25:49.286
your mom's boyfriend.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.592
<i>I'm guessing they have</i> <i>
a little</i>

25:50.636 --> 25:52.289
distribution racket
running?

25:52.333 --> 25:53.769
Yeah, and we'd bet money

25:53.813 --> 25:55.379
that one of the dealers
they sell to

25:55.423 --> 25:58.252
is the guy we arrested
in Quest One.

25:58.295 --> 26:00.471
That's quite an epic tale.

26:00.515 --> 26:04.258
Let's cut out this fantasy crap,
shall we, Leo?

26:04.301 --> 26:06.390
We know you didn't send us
to that house

26:06.434 --> 26:08.436
to avenge a classmate.
There is no classmate.

26:08.479 --> 26:12.135
But I think there is a princess
you need us to save.

26:12.179 --> 26:15.530
Your mom -- she has
a history of drug abuse,

26:15.574 --> 26:17.663
but it seems like
she'd been clean for a while?

26:19.578 --> 26:22.450
She relapsed
after my dad died.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.974
Then she rallied,
got herself clean.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.673
It was good,
like before.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.677
Then she met Brian.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.723
You have to get her
away from him.

26:34.767 --> 26:37.987
He's killing her.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.424
That's your third quest.
Leo out.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.428
We have no evidence
tying Brian to the fentanyl.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.865
We can't arrest him.

26:45.908 --> 26:48.084
And Leo's got 40 minutes
before he runs out of fuel.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.484
Yeah.

26:56.527 --> 26:58.094
Tell me
you found something.

26:58.138 --> 27:00.575
Some old gloves, possible
burglary tools, impact weapons.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.185
Nothing that's gonna help us.
What's going on?

27:02.229 --> 27:03.839
Dez is about to walk out of here
with his lawyer.

27:03.883 --> 27:05.101
Right now,
all I can charge him with

27:05.145 --> 27:06.842
is possession
of stolen property.

27:06.886 --> 27:09.366
Can you stall them?20 minutes.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.803
Sorry, Sarge.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.195
We've turned this place
upside down.

27:12.239 --> 27:14.676
These tools here
are all we could find.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.026
- 'Cause you're only human.
- Excuse me?

27:17.070 --> 27:20.073
L-100, I need 8706
at my location, Code 3.

27:20.116 --> 27:21.552
<i>Copy that.</i> 8706?

27:21.596 --> 27:22.728
Uh, why the hell
do we need him here?

27:22.771 --> 27:24.164
You'll see.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.209
Okay, taking your statement
into consideration...

27:26.253 --> 27:29.560
And the few online articles that
we read about your case --

27:29.604 --> 27:33.042
Come on, just -- you can just
tell me straight.

27:33.086 --> 27:36.045
- Can you get me outta here?
- Way too early to tell.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.743
But what I've read has
definitely triggered

27:37.786 --> 27:38.874
some alarms.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.354
I mean, it's clear
there were several

27:40.397 --> 27:42.051
investigative discrepancies,
and clearly,

27:42.095 --> 27:44.010
you were not given
adequate counsel.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.708
So what do I do?
Let me make some calls.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.015
There are a few lawyers I would
trust to take your case.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.538
- Pro bono?
- Pro bono.

27:50.581 --> 27:53.584
That's great.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.717
But there are
no guarantees here, okay?

27:55.761 --> 27:58.894
There's no promises,
just a little hope.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.374
That's all I can handle.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.724
This will be the hardest fight
of your life.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.248
I'm ready.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.773
I appreciate you both.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.080
You.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.825
You listened.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.482
It's been a long time since
anybody's done that.

28:23.353 --> 28:24.093
Thank you.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.316
See, bomb sniffing dogs
don't look for bombs,

28:29.359 --> 28:30.447
they look for bomb ingredients,

28:30.491 --> 28:32.188
like gunpowder
from an illegal firearm.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.454
Come on, boy, you got this.

28:39.674 --> 28:40.980
Are you kidding me?

28:41.023 --> 28:42.982
Did you really just get
distracted by a squirrel?

28:43.025 --> 28:45.767
Do you realize
how clichéd that is?

28:51.077 --> 28:52.905
He found something.

29:01.348 --> 29:02.088
Okay.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.785
Got him.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.529
Oh, hey,
you just missed James.

29:08.572 --> 29:09.791
He and Wesley went down
to the cafeteria

29:09.835 --> 29:11.010
to make some calls.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.534
They're gonna get Langston
an attorney.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.623
I'll text them
and tell them

29:15.666 --> 29:17.625
not to waste their time,
'cause a retrial

29:17.668 --> 29:19.627
isn't gonna matter.
Why?

29:19.670 --> 29:21.803
Sheriff's Department combed
through security footage

29:21.847 --> 29:23.152
from the prison riot.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.851
Your innocent man here
stomped a guard.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.202
Is he okay?
No.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.986
He is paralyzed
from the waist down.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.553
They are charging Langston

29:32.596 --> 29:34.642
with attempted murder
of a peace officer.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.035
That's a 20-to-life
sentence.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.733
Which is why a retrial
is pointless.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.170
He's not getting out
of prison.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.653
Yo, this system is a joke.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.829
I mean, if Langston wasn't
wrongfully convicted

29:47.873 --> 29:49.352
in the first place,
he wouldn't have spent

29:49.396 --> 29:51.093
half his life stuck in prison,
wouldn't have been caught up

29:51.137 --> 29:53.574
in that riot, thinking
the only way to survive
was to stomp a guard.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.839
What are you doing?

29:59.885 --> 30:02.539
I'm gonna tell him
that it's over.

30:11.418 --> 30:14.116
How's Cupcake?

30:14.160 --> 30:16.858
The alligator?
Yeah.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.164
Fine.

30:18.207 --> 30:21.820
You, on the other hand,
are screwed, my friend.

30:21.863 --> 30:24.387
My officers found a stockpile of
fentanyl in your house.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.650
- Where'd you get it?
- H-Has she seen a vet yet?

30:26.694 --> 30:28.870
They --
She swallowed a Taser.

30:28.914 --> 30:32.352
Hey, you are in a lot of
trouble, Murray.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.441
You need to focus
on the drugs.

30:34.484 --> 30:37.357
Now, we know you've been selling
to high school kids.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.185
- Who are you working with?
- No one, man.

30:39.228 --> 30:41.361
Look, this is
important, okay?

30:41.404 --> 30:43.450
Cupcake has
a very specific diet.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.582
I-I can write it down
for you.

30:48.585 --> 30:51.023
Okay, I'll do you
one better.

30:51.066 --> 30:54.330
I'll let you talk to the people
taking care of Cupcake

30:54.374 --> 30:55.679
and make sure
she's all right.

30:55.723 --> 30:58.987
But first, you need to
name your accomplices.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.902
Deal.

31:02.730 --> 31:03.687
Okay.

31:03.731 --> 31:04.732
Murray flipped.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.125
<i>We got a warrant</i> <i>
on Brian Johst.</i>

31:06.168 --> 31:07.953
<i>You want to serve it?</i> Yes, sir.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.432
Thank you very much.

31:11.391 --> 31:16.222
Attention, Airship Three,
I have a quest for <i>you.</i>

31:18.615 --> 31:19.703
What is it?

31:19.747 --> 31:21.183
Can you see your house
from up there?

31:21.227 --> 31:22.924
Hold on.

31:29.017 --> 31:30.932
- Thank you very much.
- Come on, let's go.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.894
Hey, Young Hero,
are you seeing this?

31:35.937 --> 31:37.025
Every second.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.461
Great.
The quest is over.

31:38.505 --> 31:39.767
I think it's time
to come down now.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.943
Oh, thank God,
'cause I have been air-sick

31:41.987 --> 31:43.553
for the past three hours,
and I --

31:44.685 --> 31:46.905
Uh-oh.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.080
What? What's wrong?

31:48.123 --> 31:49.385
I'm out of gas.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.275
Come on, come on.

32:09.318 --> 32:10.624
Yes.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.156
That was -- Oh, wow.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.115
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.334
Hey.
That was, uh...

32:25.378 --> 32:27.380
- That was intense.
- Never do that again.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.208
Yeah, the, um,

32:29.251 --> 32:32.385
hero's journey is over.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.126
Oh.
Not yet.

32:36.824 --> 32:40.523
What?
You stole
a police helicopter, Leo.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.221
You're under arrest.

32:52.318 --> 32:53.449
- What'd he give us?
- Everything.

32:53.493 --> 32:54.885
Every job, every guy
on his crew.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.104
And the location
of tonight's robbery?

32:56.148 --> 32:57.149
Yeah, and they're supposed to
hit the house

32:57.192 --> 32:58.498
within the hour.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.732
Give me the keys
and phone.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.519
You know, nobody takes pride
in their work anymore.

33:19.562 --> 33:20.868
Used to be
a getaway driver

33:20.911 --> 33:22.391
was hyper-alert
during a robbery.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.045
I blame social media.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.394
Look, I don't know
what this is about,

33:25.438 --> 33:26.700
but you got
the wrong guy.

33:26.743 --> 33:28.049
No, we don't.
Dez told us

33:28.093 --> 33:29.920
you'd be parked right here,
keeping a look-out.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.358
He also said there's three guys
inside robbing the place.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.229
Is he right?
Is there three men inside?

33:36.101 --> 33:37.624
Answer quick, because if they
start killing people,

33:37.667 --> 33:39.930
those murders are on you.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.497
Yeah.

33:41.541 --> 33:45.197
It's three guys, supposed to be
in and out in 30 minutes,

33:45.240 --> 33:46.502
and they're 28 minutes in.

33:46.546 --> 33:47.764
So, what was
the plan going in?

33:47.808 --> 33:49.897
Where are
we gonna find 'em?

33:49.940 --> 33:51.377
Master bedroom's upstairs.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.727
That's where the safe is.
Don cracks the safe

33:53.770 --> 33:56.077
while Terry loots
the rest of the bedrooms.

33:56.121 --> 33:59.602
Stosh's job is to keep a gun on
the family downstairs.

33:59.646 --> 34:00.516
Get out.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.520
Come on.
Go that way.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.179
We can't go in hot
with a guy hovering

34:11.223 --> 34:13.181
over the family
with a weapon.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.966
So we go in
a different way.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.194
Alpha team set.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.214
Someone's here.

34:56.877 --> 34:59.184
Delivery guy.
I'll get rid of him.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.709
We didn't order anything!
Go away!

35:06.321 --> 35:08.628
- Get down! Get down!
- Get down on the ground!

35:08.671 --> 35:10.195
Don't move.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.284
Man #Clear!

35:12.327 --> 35:13.546
- All clear!
- Clear!

35:13.589 --> 35:15.548
Hostages secure.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.125
Ugh!

35:28.343 --> 35:29.562
Give me a bang!

35:32.695 --> 35:34.349
Ugh!

36:11.299 --> 36:12.561
You okay?

36:12.605 --> 36:14.607
You know it.

36:19.394 --> 36:20.700
Hey.
Sheriff Department's here

36:20.743 --> 36:22.223
to transport Langston
back to prison.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.572
So we're free to go,
if you're ready.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.444
I am.
Bloodwork came back clear.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.446
That's great news.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.361
No way!

36:29.404 --> 36:30.884
Told you
I was no joke.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.234
What?! I have not seen one of
these since I was 10.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.062
Wh-Where did you
find this?

36:35.105 --> 36:36.455
You can get anything
on the dark web.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.239
Wow. Thank you.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.893
You really are
the best assistant ever.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.243
You don't lose him.

36:42.287 --> 36:45.551
Actually, I have to
tender my resignation.

36:45.594 --> 36:46.987
Hulu just bought
my pilot!

36:47.030 --> 36:49.119
What? That's great.
Congratulations.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.164
Thanks.
Yeah.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.600
Guess I need
my own assistant now.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.733
Good luck
with the show.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.300
And your baby.
Thank you.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.521
Hmm.
Hmm.

36:59.565 --> 37:00.740
Don't touch it.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.132
Hey.

37:02.176 --> 37:05.353
I'll go pull
the shop around.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.399
So everything is fine.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.270
Best bloodwork
she's ever seen.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.229
I knew it would be.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.187
Listen, I-I am sorry.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.841
I should've
called you earlier.

37:14.884 --> 37:18.279
But to tell you the truth,
I was terrified.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.194
And I needed to pretend
that it was nothing

37:20.238 --> 37:23.284
and if I called you,
I would have to admit

37:23.328 --> 37:25.765
that it could be something.

37:25.808 --> 37:27.506
And I-I get that,

37:27.549 --> 37:31.292
but you shouldn't deal
with these things alone.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.990
Look, trust me,
fear is the worst thing

37:34.034 --> 37:35.688
to have to go through
by yourself.

37:35.731 --> 37:36.950
Uh...

37:36.993 --> 37:39.779
There's, uh, something
I haven't told you.

37:39.822 --> 37:44.000
Um... I was diagnosed
with placenta previa

37:44.044 --> 37:47.917
when I had Lila,
and I started hemorrhaging

37:47.961 --> 37:49.832
late in the pregnancy.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.139
Which is why you freaked out
about a little heartburn.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.707
I should be happy,
you know,

37:54.750 --> 37:57.710
planning her nursery
and buying clothes,

37:57.753 --> 38:00.539
but I'm just terrified
something's gonna happen.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.977
Maybe we can take this
one day at a time.

38:04.020 --> 38:08.242
You know, whatever, we'll --
we'll -- we'll deal with it...

38:08.286 --> 38:09.591
together.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.071
I'm good with that.

38:12.464 --> 38:15.205
So, what is the deal
with the creepy old doll?

38:15.249 --> 38:16.424
She's not creepy.

38:16.468 --> 38:18.818
Oh, no. All dolls
are inherently creepy.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.473
Spoken like the father
of two boys.

38:21.516 --> 38:22.648
Here, hold her.

38:22.691 --> 38:25.825
- Oh, I-I really don't want to.
- Hold her!

38:29.089 --> 38:31.657
Look at how cute
this is.

38:31.700 --> 38:32.745
Come on.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.703
- Got all your stuff?
- Yeah.

38:34.747 --> 38:36.879
- And your court summons?
- Yeah.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.012
But they took my police ID,
though.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.883
The one you stole
to access the roof?

38:40.927 --> 38:43.103
Not surprised.
Where did you get that, anyway?

38:43.146 --> 38:44.844
I lifted it off some cop.

38:44.887 --> 38:48.021
Uh, S-S-Smith? Schmitt?

38:48.064 --> 38:49.239
Smitty?

38:49.283 --> 38:50.850
Yeah.
You know him?

38:50.893 --> 38:52.373
Yeah.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.507
Well, look, thank you.

38:55.550 --> 38:56.638
Not a problem.

38:56.682 --> 39:00.250
Listen, if ever
you have a problem,

39:00.294 --> 39:04.037
before you go stealing
any aircraft, just call me.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.691
Just aircrafts?
Any vessel.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.084
Any wheeled vehicle.
Or animal --

39:08.128 --> 39:10.565
Basically, anything
you could ride in or on.

39:10.609 --> 39:14.047
Deal. What if I have another
epic quest to go on?

39:14.090 --> 39:15.048
Try the bus.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.702
Okay, yeah.
That makes sense.

39:16.745 --> 39:17.920
♪ Stay strong for me
and I'll stay strong for you ♪

39:17.964 --> 39:20.923
♪ Summer is here
but it's slipping away ♪

39:20.967 --> 39:23.317
♪ Why would we want
to waste a good day? ♪

39:23.361 --> 39:24.884
Okay, I got it.
Yeah.

39:24.927 --> 39:27.060
Yeah, look, so, um,
just give me some time,

39:27.103 --> 39:29.279
and I'll get everything you need
over to you.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.194
Yeah. Hey, look, man,
I-I really appreciate this,

39:31.238 --> 39:33.283
and so does Mr. Bryant.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.025
- Alright. Bye.
- What are you doing?

39:36.069 --> 39:38.811
Wesley gave me a name
of a lawyer

39:38.854 --> 39:40.421
willing to take
Langston's case.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.468
Why? I thought we agreed
that it was over for that guy.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.165
He -- He paralyzed a guard.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.820
Right. And he should
be punished for that.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.475
But he may not have killed
that cop 18 years ago,

39:50.518 --> 39:53.782
and we owe it to that officer's
family to find the truth.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.262
Because if Langston's innocent,
then that means

39:55.305 --> 39:56.872
there's someone out there
right now

39:56.916 --> 39:59.353
who got away with murder.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.182
Who gets to sleep in his bed
every night,

40:02.225 --> 40:06.447
gets to walk out of his front
door a free man every morning.

40:06.491 --> 40:10.582
I can't imagine how hard
it must have been for you.

40:10.625 --> 40:14.716
I was locked in a cell
for 541 days,

40:14.760 --> 40:17.240
in a prison that was built
in the 1800s --

40:17.284 --> 40:20.113
and, trust me, it hadn't
gotten nicer with age.

40:20.156 --> 40:22.811
My best friend was dead.
I thought my life was over.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.466
But you know what?
I got lucky, I got out,

40:25.510 --> 40:27.076
and I got a second chance.

40:27.120 --> 40:30.297
But the person
who murdered Patrick --

40:30.340 --> 40:32.255
he's still out there.

40:32.299 --> 40:35.781
And -- And no one
is looking for him,

40:35.824 --> 40:37.304
because they still think
that I did it.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.306
♪ And I'll stay strong for you

40:46.356 --> 40:48.402
You need a little help?

40:48.446 --> 40:50.448
No.
I need lots of help.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.537
I don't -- I don't know
what I'm doing.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.800
Okay.
Show me what you got.

40:54.843 --> 40:57.498
♪ It's one way how to deal

40:57.542 --> 41:00.240
Hey. Ready to go?

41:00.283 --> 41:02.068
Yeah. Can't wait
to get horizontal.

41:02.111 --> 41:05.158
It's been a long day.

41:05.201 --> 41:06.855
I've been doing
some thinking --

41:06.899 --> 41:08.378
I've warned you
about that.

41:08.422 --> 41:11.207
I helped Aaron out today,
just looking at a case.

41:11.251 --> 41:12.600
I heard.

41:12.644 --> 41:13.775
You think he's innocent?

41:13.819 --> 41:15.211
Maybe.

41:15.255 --> 41:17.039
I don't know for sure.

41:17.083 --> 41:20.521
You know, what I <i>do</i> know
is he had a terrible lawyer.

41:20.565 --> 41:23.045
I think when I get my license
back, I might want to --

41:23.089 --> 41:27.049
You want to do even more
pro bono work.

41:27.093 --> 41:28.181
Am I that predictable?

41:28.224 --> 41:29.574
Yes, you are.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.227
I always know you're gonna do
the selfless thing

41:31.271 --> 41:33.403
because that's
the kind of man you are.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.753
And you're okay with that?

41:34.796 --> 41:36.232
Why? Because you're gonna make
even less money?

41:36.276 --> 41:38.017
Why would I have
a problem with that?

41:38.060 --> 41:39.975
Yeah.

41:43.196 --> 41:45.546
Hey. You walked Leo out?

41:45.590 --> 41:47.026
Yeah, just left him
with his mom.

41:47.069 --> 41:48.941
What you got there?

41:48.984 --> 41:50.464
It's for
completing your quests.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.683
Hey!

41:51.726 --> 41:53.119
But you completed them
with me.

41:53.162 --> 41:55.338
I know. I made a trophy
for myself, too.

41:55.382 --> 41:57.515
Anyone else
have a crazy day?

41:57.558 --> 41:59.778
- You have no idea.
- You know what?

41:59.821 --> 42:01.344
Let's get changed,
- grab a drink.
- Yes.

42:01.388 --> 42:02.737
- On Nolan.
- Whoa.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.609
We're good for one. Then we need
to spring the nanny.

42:06.785 --> 42:07.829
Sorry, hold up.

42:07.873 --> 42:09.614
I'm authorizing
all overtime.

42:09.657 --> 42:12.225
There was an accident
at Animal Control,

42:12.268 --> 42:13.705
and they need
all the help they can get.

42:13.748 --> 42:15.402
What's going on?

42:15.445 --> 42:16.751
Cupcake broke free.

42:17.839 --> 42:18.927
Who's Cupcake?
