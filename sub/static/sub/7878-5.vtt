Francine, you okay?

01:10.339 --> 01:12.574
My father turned
68 today.

01:12.642 --> 01:14.209
He's not getting
any younger.

01:14.277 --> 01:17.212
I tried to talk to Stan about
moving my parents to town,

01:17.280 --> 01:19.014
but he refuses to
even discuss it.

01:19.081 --> 01:21.950
That must be tough, you two having
the same argument every year.

01:22.018 --> 01:23.518
What? No, we don't.

This is the first time
I've ever brought it up.

Francine, I want you
to come home right now.

01:30.192 --> 01:32.761
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

01:32.828 --> 01:34.596
Oh, this is a
private discussion.

01:34.664 --> 01:35.997
We'll leave you two alone.

01:43.272 --> 01:45.907
I'm sorry, okay?

01:45.975 --> 01:49.544
You're just saying you're sorry because
you want this conversation to be over.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.914
You're right.
You're right.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.449
We need some help
communicating.

01:54.517 --> 01:55.950
I think we should
see a therapist.

01:56.018 --> 01:58.053
Really? You would
do that for me?

01:58.120 --> 01:59.321
For us.

01:59.388 --> 02:00.488
Oh, Stan.

02:00.556 --> 02:02.290
I'll find someone
for us to talk to.

Aah, I saw it.

02:15.438 --> 02:17.439
Look what I won
at the carnival.

02:17.506 --> 02:19.441
She's beautiful.

02:19.508 --> 02:21.776
Yeah, the good Lord used
every crayon in the box

02:21.844 --> 02:23.712
when he made this gal.

02:23.779 --> 02:26.147
I'm gonna stick an M80 in her
and blow her to bits.

02:26.215 --> 02:28.616
Wait. Why don't you
drop her in my bowl?

02:28.684 --> 02:30.585
I'd be happy for
the companionship

02:30.653 --> 02:32.821
even if it is with a
normal non-speaking fish.

02:32.888 --> 02:35.056
Wow, look at you.

What's your sign?

02:40.096 --> 02:41.329
Pisces?

02:46.569 --> 02:49.304
My husband never
wants to hear me out.

02:49.372 --> 02:52.607
Instead of talking things
through, he just pushes me off.

02:52.675 --> 02:55.310
Don't worry,
I'll fix everything.

02:55.378 --> 02:57.011
Let's start with
you, Francine.

02:57.079 --> 02:59.114
I want you to feel
completely relaxed.

02:59.181 --> 03:01.516
Imagine warm liquid
filling your body--

03:01.584 --> 03:04.152
starting at your feet and
rising slowly to your head.

03:04.220 --> 03:07.389
When I snap my fingers, you are going
to fall into a deep, dream-like state.

03:08.991 --> 03:11.526
So, Stan, want me to
give her the regular?

03:11.594 --> 03:13.828
Yup, Sal, time
for her annual tune-up.

03:13.896 --> 03:15.430
Ooh, mixed nuts

03:15.498 --> 03:18.166
There's quite a few things
I'd like you to make her forget.

03:18.234 --> 03:20.118
She wants to move her
parents to town again, huh?

03:20.186 --> 03:23.855
Every year
on her dad's birthday.

03:23.923 --> 03:26.458
There we go.
There's the winner.

03:26.525 --> 03:29.878
Here's a list of some other things
I'd like repressed this year.

03:29.945 --> 03:32.881
She talked about getting a puppy
again-- let's get rid of that.

03:32.948 --> 03:35.083
She wanted to get
a subway map shower curtain--

03:35.151 --> 03:36.751
need to nip that in the bud.

03:36.819 --> 03:39.788
She wants me to start picking
my shoes up off the floor.

03:39.855 --> 03:41.923
She's also been grousing about
the night I sleep-punched her.

03:41.991 --> 03:43.992
And there's plenty more.

03:44.059 --> 03:45.760
Oh, and while you're
knocking around in there,

03:45.828 --> 03:47.762
get her to love the films
of Emilio Estevez.

03:47.830 --> 03:49.464
How great is that guy?

03:49.532 --> 03:51.733
He's a Sheen,
he's from an acting dynasty,

03:51.801 --> 03:53.034
yet he chooses to be Mexican.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.469
Makes it huge.

03:54.537 --> 03:55.837
Realizes people have
had enough of him,

03:55.905 --> 03:58.440
and is decent enough to fall off
the face of the Earth.

03:58.507 --> 04:01.643
Emi-lio-ooo!
No problem.

04:01.710 --> 04:04.095
Do your magic. I'm going to get
a sandwich across the street.

04:04.180 --> 04:06.181
Oh, I'll take a...

04:06.248 --> 04:08.216

of cut-up tuna can lids.

10:22.295 --> 10:23.762
Now about your career...

10:23.830 --> 10:27.366
I'm flattered, but this
all happened 20 years ago.

10:27.433 --> 10:29.167
I might not be
good anymore.

10:29.235 --> 10:31.436
Nonsense. Once you've got it,
you never lose it.

10:31.504 --> 10:33.105
You have talent herpes.

10:33.172 --> 10:34.706
I have regular herpes.
Thank you, Mindy Cohn.

10:34.774 --> 10:36.341
So what do you say, you in?

10:36.409 --> 10:40.112
I can't believe
Stan made me forget all this.

10:40.179 --> 10:41.613
Hell, yes, I'm in.

10:41.681 --> 10:43.115
Good. We'll start with

10:43.182 --> 10:45.817
with the standup-slash-topless
bar circuit and work our way up.

10:45.885 --> 10:47.552
I have to perform topless?

10:47.620 --> 10:48.687
You're not topless.

10:48.755 --> 10:49.921
The staff is topless.

10:49.989 --> 10:51.590
You want to get noticed?

10:51.657 --> 10:53.992
Your ha-has have to be bigger
than their ta-tas.

10:56.963 --> 10:58.930
Are you sure
about all this?

10:58.998 --> 11:00.999
Remember when Rudy
from <i>The Cosby Show</i>

11:01.067 --> 11:02.701
got old and stopped
being cute?

11:02.769 --> 11:04.770
I brought them Raven-Symone.

11:04.837 --> 11:06.405
Saw her on a Philadelphia
playground

11:06.472 --> 11:07.639
and knew she was a star.

11:07.707 --> 11:09.374
Snatched her right up.

11:09.442 --> 11:11.276
Six months later, her
parents saw her on TV

11:11.344 --> 11:12.644
and realized
she was still alive.

11:12.712 --> 11:14.279
Did some time for that.

11:14.347 --> 11:16.782
So, you ask,
am I sure about this?

11:16.849 --> 11:17.816
I don't know.

11:22.055 --> 11:23.472
She's a terrible wife.

11:23.539 --> 11:25.323
She has no maternal instincts.

11:25.391 --> 11:26.691
She can't be that bad.

11:26.759 --> 11:29.127
She ate three of the children!

11:29.195 --> 11:32.531
And poor little Susan,
she only ate half of her.

11:32.598 --> 11:33.732
She wasn't even hungry.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.301
She was just eating to eat!

11:39.005 --> 11:40.672
Coming from an Asian family,

11:40.740 --> 11:43.275
my parents had never seen boobs.

11:43.342 --> 11:45.243
No cup size was
bigger than an A.

11:45.311 --> 11:46.511
And that was my dad's.

11:55.922 --> 11:57.823
You know why Chinese couples

11:57.890 --> 11:59.691
can't have their own
Caucasian babies?

11:59.759 --> 12:02.928
Because two Wongs
don't make a white.

12:09.836 --> 12:11.803
I called in a bunch of favors

12:11.871 --> 12:13.705
and put together
a talent showcase

12:13.773 --> 12:16.374
at the mother of all
stripper-slash-comedy clubs.

12:16.442 --> 12:18.176
Hilareola's?

12:18.227 --> 12:19.878
You got me booked
at Hilareola's?!

12:19.946 --> 12:22.214
A bunch of TV execs
are gonna be there.

12:22.281 --> 12:24.149
You're my ticket
back to the bigs.

12:24.217 --> 12:26.918
No. This is exactly what
I was trying to avoid.

12:26.986 --> 12:29.087
My whole world is changing.

12:29.155 --> 12:31.523
Dinner's not on the table,
I'm wearing dirty shirts,

12:31.591 --> 12:33.458
there's no one taking
my shoes upstairs.

12:33.526 --> 12:35.494
We'll talk
about it later.

12:35.561 --> 12:37.295
How does that feel?

12:39.632 --> 12:42.033
By the look on his face,
not good.

12:48.541 --> 12:50.709
You boys are going
to eat her up.

12:53.412 --> 12:54.412
What?

12:54.480 --> 12:55.981
TV people don't
do this anymore?

12:56.048 --> 12:57.015
No.

12:58.751 --> 13:01.153
Stan, what are you
doing here?

13:01.220 --> 13:02.921
I just came to wish you luck.

13:02.989 --> 13:05.357
This is a big night. <i>Huge</i> night.

13:05.424 --> 13:07.125
Now, I don't want
to scare you,

13:07.193 --> 13:09.161
but the place is packed
with TV executives.

13:09.228 --> 13:10.562
Lot of pressure.

13:10.630 --> 13:13.198
If you're trying to rattle me,
it won't work.

13:13.266 --> 13:15.767
Welcome to Hilareola's.

13:15.835 --> 13:17.602
Tonight we have Langley Falls'

13:17.670 --> 13:20.872
blossoming new comedienne,
Francine Ling.

13:20.940 --> 13:23.975
Don't blow it. Your material's
as tired as your face.

13:30.950 --> 13:33.001
How's everyone do...?

13:43.846 --> 13:45.497
Well, you tried, Francine.

13:45.565 --> 13:49.467
FOX ordered six episodes for a
sitcom based on my stand-up.

13:49.535 --> 13:51.703
What?!
I'm leaving for Hollywood.

13:51.771 --> 13:53.772
But I saw you
throw up onstage.

13:53.839 --> 13:55.240
You shouldn't
have left.

13:55.308 --> 13:56.608
She riffed
for 20 minutes

13:56.676 --> 13:58.710
on how Chinese food
looks like vomit.

13:58.778 --> 14:00.412
"Mongolian barf-ecue."

14:00.479 --> 14:01.580
Hilarious!

14:02.748 --> 14:05.217
I'll send for my things.

14:05.284 --> 14:06.585
You can't just leave.

14:06.652 --> 14:08.787
Stan, you don't
control me anymore.

14:08.854 --> 14:11.456
I'm going to live my life,
and you can't stop me.

14:11.524 --> 14:12.724
I'm going, too.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.226
I'm a non-writing producer,

14:14.293 --> 14:16.061
which means I get
paid to do nothing.

14:16.128 --> 14:17.712
I might even
be a hindrance.

14:17.780 --> 14:20.498
I'm gonna call everyone to tell
them Sweeps is coming to town.

14:20.566 --> 14:23.568
I'm gonna get off the plane and
go right to Dana Plato's grave.

14:23.636 --> 14:24.736
I owe it to her.

14:24.804 --> 14:25.937
I killed her.

14:51.570 --> 14:52.495
And that's the news.

14:52.744 --> 14:54.528
We'll be back with sports.

14:54.596 --> 14:57.030
<i>What happens</i>
<i>when an adopted white girl</i>

14:57.098 --> 14:58.832
<i>is raised by a Chinese family?</i>

14:58.900 --> 15:00.684
<i>This fall on Fox.</i>

15:00.752 --> 15:04.755
<i>Francine Ling and P.D. Wang</i>
<i>star in</i> White Rice.

15:04.823 --> 15:06.190
<i>Chopstick around.</i>

15:06.257 --> 15:08.926
<i>It's egg foo fun</i>
<i>for the whole family.</i>

15:08.993 --> 15:10.294
I miss her, Klaus.

15:10.361 --> 15:12.362
Really? I couldn't tell.

15:12.430 --> 15:13.764
What am I gonna do?

15:13.832 --> 15:15.265
Change.
Huh?

15:15.333 --> 15:18.969
If you want her back, then
you're going to have to change.

15:19.037 --> 15:21.371
Don't let your marriage
fall apart like mine did.

15:21.439 --> 15:26.009
I hate your face so much.

15:30.882 --> 15:32.783
I love show night
rehearsal.

15:32.851 --> 15:34.718
It's a chance
to fine-tune the show

15:34.786 --> 15:36.520
before they bring
the audience in.

15:36.588 --> 15:39.323
It's also my chance to pick out
one of the extras to pork.

15:39.390 --> 15:41.258
Hey, Toots, you want
a part on the show?

15:41.326 --> 15:42.259
Let's see 'em.

15:42.327 --> 15:43.994
Sir, that is sexual harassment.

15:44.062 --> 15:45.963
Not if I don't
have a boner.

15:46.030 --> 15:46.930
Know the law.

15:50.568 --> 15:52.469
Okay, Francine,
you're getting ready

15:52.537 --> 15:55.806
for your father's 70th
birthday party, and... action.

15:55.874 --> 15:59.142
Uncle Fung is bringing dessert
and Dan will be home any minute.

15:59.210 --> 16:01.144
Does he have to come
to my birthday?

16:01.212 --> 16:02.579
He's my husband.

16:02.647 --> 16:04.648
We know, but
he is white.

16:04.716 --> 16:05.916
I'm white.

16:05.984 --> 16:08.252
You are a
reverse banana.

16:08.319 --> 16:11.588
You are white on outside,
yellow on inside.

16:11.656 --> 16:14.391
Laugh, laugh, laugh...
You two exit to the kitchen.

16:14.459 --> 16:16.226
Dan, you enter
and cross to Francine.

16:16.294 --> 16:19.396
Dan, I need to talk to you
about something.

16:19.464 --> 16:21.231
My father's turning 70,

16:21.299 --> 16:22.983
and he's not getting
any younger.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.868
I've got dessert.

16:24.936 --> 16:26.570
You're amazing, P.D.

16:26.638 --> 16:27.671
Let's break for dinner.

16:27.739 --> 16:28.939
We shoot in one hour.

16:30.341 --> 16:32.009
We're hitting our
stride, Frannie.

16:32.076 --> 16:33.277
Shooting our sixth episode.

16:33.344 --> 16:35.212
Premiering next week.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.647
I can't believe
my husband

16:36.714 --> 16:38.882
didn't want me to
have all of this.

16:38.950 --> 16:41.218
Well, I can tell you
this...

16:41.286 --> 16:43.186
I need some money
for more coke.

16:47.792 --> 16:49.843
I'm coming, baby.

17:00.738 --> 17:03.206
Do you have a drive-on?

17:03.274 --> 17:05.008
I'm Kristen Johnston.

17:05.076 --> 17:07.310
Oh, yes, of course,
Ms. Johnston.

17:09.012 --> 17:10.747
He's my
husband.

17:10.815 --> 17:13.083
We know, but he is white.

17:13.151 --> 17:14.017
I'm white.

17:14.085 --> 17:16.319
You are a reverse banana.

17:16.387 --> 17:17.654
What?

17:17.722 --> 17:20.290
You are white on outside,
yellow on inside.

17:22.426 --> 17:24.861
Is this where
Francine Ling lives?

17:24.929 --> 17:26.597
Uh, this is a set.

17:26.664 --> 17:28.515
And this is a fist.

17:30.034 --> 17:31.835
Francine, we need to talk.

17:31.903 --> 17:33.604
Stan, what are
you doing here?

17:33.671 --> 17:35.572
I'm not afraid
of change. I...

17:37.141 --> 17:39.109
Oh, I didn't realize
you had people over.

17:40.545 --> 17:41.845
Who is that guy?

17:41.913 --> 17:43.380
It's Kristen Johnston.
Just keep rolling.

17:43.448 --> 17:46.550
Look, I got that gold chain
you wanted to talk about.

17:46.618 --> 17:48.919
I'm also wearing cargo
shorts, like you wanted.

17:48.987 --> 17:50.954
Ten years ago you wanted to
paint the kitchen purple.

17:51.022 --> 17:52.055
I painted it.

17:52.123 --> 17:54.124
I have 20 dogs in the car.

17:54.192 --> 17:56.226
One for every year
you asked for one.

17:56.294 --> 17:58.629
All the things you
ever wanted, I did.

17:58.696 --> 18:00.631
I've changed for you.

18:00.698 --> 18:04.635
It turns out the only change I
can't live with is losing you.

18:04.702 --> 18:06.336
Aw...!

18:06.404 --> 18:07.571
I've got dessert.

18:07.639 --> 18:08.905
Get out
or I'll shoot you.

18:10.842 --> 18:14.711
Stan, I'm touched that
you made all these changes,

18:14.779 --> 18:16.680
but that's not what I wanted.

18:16.748 --> 18:18.682
It-it isn't?

18:18.750 --> 18:19.916
No.

18:19.984 --> 18:22.586
I just wanted to talk
those things through.

18:22.654 --> 18:24.521
I wasn't sure about them.

18:24.589 --> 18:27.257
That's why I needed
to discuss them with you.

18:27.325 --> 18:30.394
Now that I see the kitchen
purple, it looks terrible.

18:30.461 --> 18:33.296
And those shorts
make you look boxy.

18:33.364 --> 18:36.333
And who knows, maybe I wouldn't
like getting off.

18:36.401 --> 18:37.367
Phew.

18:39.637 --> 18:42.539
And as for my stand-up career,

18:42.607 --> 18:44.641
if we had just
talked it through,

18:44.709 --> 18:47.711
you would've realized it didn't
mean I would leave you.

18:47.779 --> 18:49.146
You could have come with me.

18:49.213 --> 18:52.315
There's a CIA office
out here in Los Angeles.

18:52.383 --> 18:54.084
Oh, yeah, I never
thought of that.

18:54.152 --> 18:55.852
This is incredibly
unprofessional.

19:01.025 --> 19:03.160
I'm really sorry, Francine.

19:03.227 --> 19:07.497
This time, I can tell
you really are sorry.

19:07.565 --> 19:10.367
So, I accept your apology.

19:10.435 --> 19:12.335
Aw...

19:12.403 --> 19:14.337
Cut! Lightning in a bottle.

19:15.573 --> 19:16.606
Yes!

19:16.674 --> 19:19.943
Oh, there is no downside
to this drug.

19:20.011 --> 19:23.213
So, you guys want to go get
some steaks at the Brown Derby?

19:26.117 --> 19:30.821
I'd like to make a toast to Francine and to
tonight's premiere of <i>White Rice.</i>

19:30.888 --> 19:32.289
It is going the distance.

19:32.356 --> 19:34.224
That's what I told
Meredith Baxter-Birney

19:34.292 --> 19:35.926
on the set of
<i>Family Ties.</i>

19:35.993 --> 19:38.645
That's when she was still
a fan of the meat rod.

19:41.999 --> 19:44.835
I can't wait to tell the kids
about moving to California.

19:44.902 --> 19:46.470
It's like a dream come true.

19:46.537 --> 19:48.238
You deserve it, baby.

19:48.306 --> 19:49.306
Quiet. The show's
coming on.

19:50.508 --> 19:53.610
Hi, Mah Mah,
what's for dinner?

19:53.678 --> 19:55.212
Eel in cow
eyeball sauce.

19:55.279 --> 19:57.214
It called the guck nu.

19:57.281 --> 20:00.183
Sounds more like
guck ewww.

20:00.251 --> 20:04.721
<i>It's an all-new episode</i>
<i>of Fits In The Hole.</i>

20:04.789 --> 20:06.590
Oh, my God.

20:06.657 --> 20:08.959
Look how fat she is
in that silver suit.

20:09.026 --> 20:10.460
I don't think
she's gonna make it.

20:10.528 --> 20:12.095
Roger, what happened
to <i>White Rice?</i>

20:12.163 --> 20:14.898
Right. It's probably
just a programming mistake.

20:14.966 --> 20:16.199
Yeah, this is Sweeps.

20:16.267 --> 20:17.601
Uh-huh.

20:17.668 --> 20:18.702
Uh-huh!

20:18.770 --> 20:20.070
Okay, thanks!

20:20.138 --> 20:21.504
We've been cancelled.

20:24.008 --> 20:25.742
After one joke?

20:25.810 --> 20:27.811
Apparently, the Asian
community is in an uproar.

20:27.879 --> 20:29.045
Oh. well.

20:29.113 --> 20:29.946
Can I borrow
your belt?

20:30.014 --> 20:31.214
And this chair?

20:33.284 --> 20:34.651
Sweeps is dead!

20:34.719 --> 20:36.753
He hung himself! No!

20:36.821 --> 20:38.388
I never gave you my belt.

20:38.456 --> 20:40.223
You didn't?
Give it to me.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.259
Sweeps is dead!

20:45.429 --> 20:48.598
Okay, Bah Bah, bye.
