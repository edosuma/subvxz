01:38.940 --> 01:40.351
How is everything,
Mr. Sabian?

01:40.420 --> 01:41.865
Great, as always.
Good.

01:41.940 --> 01:44.022
You get home now, Eva.
It's getting late.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.190
Stay safe.

01:46.260 --> 01:48.661
Yeah. You, too,
Mr. Sabian.

01:48.740 --> 01:50.504
<i>Traffic is
building rapidly downtown,</i>

01:50.580 --> 01:53.424
<i>as citizens rush to get home
before commencement.</i>

01:53.500 --> 01:55.389
<i>If you're not Purging,
we advise you</i>

01:55.460 --> 01:57.260
<i>to get off the streets
as quickly as possible.</i>

01:57.300 --> 01:59.029
<i>It'll soon be
a war out there.</i>

01:59.260 --> 02:01.308
<i>Prognosticators estimate
that more people</i>

02:01.380 --> 02:02.461
<i>will partake in
this year's Purge...</i>

02:02.620 --> 02:04.384
Sabian's gone.
That's it.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.668
What is she waiting for? Why
doesn't this bitch let us go?

02:06.820 --> 02:09.265
Hey, calm down.
We got plenty of time.

02:09.340 --> 02:11.183
You girls up to
anything fun tonight?

02:11.300 --> 02:13.302
I might kidnap Eva
this year.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.070
Hope that's okay
with you, mami.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.345
It's getting late.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.980
Hope to see you all tomorrow.
Stay safe.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.266
Okay, stay safe.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.423
Finally.
Stay safe, Mrs. Crawley.

02:30.820 --> 02:32.709
Eva.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.270
Need a ride home?

02:34.420 --> 02:35.945
I'm fine, Carlos.

02:36.100 --> 02:40.264
Stay safe.

02:40.340 --> 02:42.502
Bye, Carlito.
Stay safe.

02:44.140 --> 02:46.950
If he asked to take me home,
I'd accept that ride, girl.

02:47.020 --> 02:48.146
He's a dog.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.344
Oh, I like that dog. I would
walk the shit out of that dog.

02:51.540 --> 02:53.460
But that dog doesn't want
anything to do with me,

02:53.500 --> 02:54.786
he wants to sniff
your ass.

02:54.860 --> 02:55.980
You're disgusting.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.385
It's true.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.023
You're really gonna
ask her tonight?

03:01.340 --> 03:02.785
I have to.

03:02.940 --> 03:05.386
I can't afford his
medicine much longer.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.868
All right, good luck.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.226
Stay safe.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.070
Stay safe, sweetie.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.911
Okay.

04:10.140 --> 04:12.820
<i>Both the people and
the government wanted the Purge.</i>

04:12.860 --> 04:14.703
<i>The New Founding
Fathers came into office...</i>

04:14.780 --> 04:17.101
<i>Were voted into office
by a country who wanted change...</i>

04:17.180 --> 04:19.945
<i>This new regime took
advantage of the nation's fear.</i>

04:28.700 --> 04:30.862
I'm glad we took
the back roads.

04:30.940 --> 04:33.910
The highways are probably
a mess right now.

04:34.380 --> 04:37.065
Yeah.
We'll be there in no time.

04:37.220 --> 04:38.426
Yeah.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.346
What are you looking at?

04:51.420 --> 04:54.310
Nothing.
Just, you know, stuff.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.746
Are you okay?

05:01.980 --> 05:04.586
Yeah. I'm fine.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.870
You sure?

05:08.300 --> 05:10.348
You don't need
to keep asking me.

05:17.660 --> 05:19.742
<i>My name is Donald Talbot.</i>

05:19.820 --> 05:23.108
<i>Our regime was voted into
office nine years ago.</i>

05:23.180 --> 05:24.909
<i>And the first
order of business</i>

05:24.980 --> 05:27.062
<i>was to deal with
the epidemic of crime</i>

05:27.140 --> 05:28.983
<i>that was plaguing
this nation.</i>

05:29.220 --> 05:32.110
<i>The answer was the Purge.</i>

05:37.140 --> 05:38.869
You need some protection tonight?
You need something?

05:38.940 --> 05:40.226
Hey, man,
we running out of...

05:40.300 --> 05:41.950
Hey, that Purge tonight,
y'all know what time it is.

05:42.020 --> 05:43.670
Hitting them in the face
ain't gonna work no more.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.151
You need
something powerful.

05:46.020 --> 05:47.101
How you doing, buddy?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.786
Use your hands, man. Just use your hands.
Don't even worry about it.

05:49.860 --> 05:51.430
Hey, sweetheart, how you doing?
How you doing?

05:51.500 --> 05:52.581
You gonna need something
for protection tonight?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.145
No. No, I'm good. I'm good.
UZI? Beretta?

05:54.220 --> 05:55.790
Look, on the cheap-cheap.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.301
Or a blade to cut your man's throat?
Whatever you need.

05:58.780 --> 06:00.862
We take any kind
of payment.

06:09.540 --> 06:10.541
Eva!

06:10.660 --> 06:12.583
Hey, Diego. What's up, girl?
How you doing?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.350
Good. How you doing?
Yeah? Everything's great?

06:14.500 --> 06:15.740
No, it's not great.
I'm tired...

06:15.820 --> 06:16.946
Oh, it could be better.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.749
Take me up there with you tonight.
Get a little protection.

06:18.820 --> 06:19.820
You know what I'm saying?

06:19.900 --> 06:20.981
Come on, now. I'm cool, Diego.
I'm good.

06:21.060 --> 06:22.061
You sure you don't
want no protection?

06:22.140 --> 06:23.141
Huh?
No, thanks, Diego.

06:23.220 --> 06:25.020
I'm the man for the job.
You know what I mean?

06:25.060 --> 06:28.746
<i>We've lost our
souls to attain this peace.</i>

06:29.580 --> 06:32.424
<i>We no longer worship
at the altar of Christ,</i>

06:32.700 --> 06:35.590
<i>Muhammad, Yahweh.</i>

06:35.740 --> 06:39.347
<i>We worship at the altar
of Smith & Wesson.</i>

06:39.420 --> 06:42.424
<i>We, the people,
know not what we do.</i>

06:42.580 --> 06:45.789
Horseshit. Where'd
you find this lunatic?

06:45.900 --> 06:47.664
I saw his protest posters
all around the neighborhood.

06:47.860 --> 06:49.430
He lives here, Papa.
He's just like us.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.868
Now, shush. Please listen. He's
not a lunatic.

06:52.940 --> 06:55.341
<i>The Purge is not about
containing crime to one night,</i>

06:55.420 --> 06:58.424
<i>and cleansing our souls
by releasing aggression.</i>

06:58.500 --> 07:01.629
<i>It's about one thing.
Money.</i>

07:02.420 --> 07:06.061
<i>Who dies tonight? The poor.</i>

07:06.580 --> 07:09.265
<i>We can't afford to
protect ourselves.</i>

07:09.460 --> 07:11.189
That's enough.
I can't listen to this crap.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.580
He's as full of shit
as they are.

07:12.620 --> 07:15.305
No, he's right. Come on. They're
keeping the population down

07:15.380 --> 07:17.621
by getting rid of people
like us to save money.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.862
Talk is cheap, Cali.
Mmm-hmm.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.420
He may be right, but he
won't do anything about it.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.544
Home.

07:29.780 --> 07:30.827
Hey, Daddy.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.466
Don't "hey, Daddy" me.
Where have you been?

07:33.540 --> 07:35.349
We're less than two hours
until commencement,

07:35.460 --> 07:36.746
and you're out gallivanting.

07:36.820 --> 07:38.310
Gallivanting? I was
picking up your medicine.

07:38.460 --> 07:41.464
Even worse.
A waste of time and money.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.788
Christ, Eva, I told you
not to get this stuff.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.464
I'm tired of listening
to this every day.

07:45.540 --> 07:46.871
It does nothing...
I'm not taking it!

07:46.980 --> 07:48.823
You're taking your medicine. I'm
not taking it! No, I'm not!

07:48.900 --> 07:51.141
Yes, you are! I'm not taking it.
You're taking it back.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.790
Oh, my God, really?

07:52.860 --> 07:53.861
Can we stop?

07:56.780 --> 08:00.182
Look, Papa, maybe it doesn't do
anything, but can you just take it?

08:00.620 --> 08:02.190
For me?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.185
Okay-

08:08.340 --> 08:11.742
We'll lockdown and then
we'll eat after commencement.

08:11.860 --> 08:12.986
Count me out.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.784
I'm gonna take a long nap,
and don't bother me.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.343
I'm gonna try to sleep through
this godforsaken holiday.

08:24.140 --> 08:27.861
Look, I'm sorry
I'm so grumpy, girls.

08:28.460 --> 08:30.667
I hate this night.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.865
Please, forgive me.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.587
You drive me crazy.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.106
Uh...

08:47.540 --> 08:49.781
Make sure you
lockdown everything.

08:51.180 --> 08:53.387
I'll take care of my room.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.824
I love you both.

08:57.540 --> 08:59.224
Very much.

09:01.220 --> 09:02.745
I know.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.229
That was weird.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.070
It must be the night.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.341
Yeah.

09:17.740 --> 09:20.220
I'm gonna take a quick shower,
and then we'll lockdown.

09:20.380 --> 09:23.190
Okay, wait. How did things go with Mrs.
Crawley?

09:23.700 --> 09:25.589
Did you get the raise?

09:28.060 --> 09:30.108
God, what a bitch.

09:30.260 --> 09:31.591
Well, did you at least
make a good argument?

09:31.660 --> 09:34.186
Did you say everything
that we practiced?

09:36.780 --> 09:38.430
I'm sorry, baby.

09:40.260 --> 09:41.705
Yeah.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.349
I want to tell her, Shane.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.461
Hey, did you hear me?

10:09.780 --> 10:11.191
I said I wanna tell
your sister...

10:11.260 --> 10:12.625
Yeah, I heard you.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.749
I just don't feel
like telling her.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.620
Why?

10:19.460 --> 10:22.384
Because as soon as you say it
out loud to another person,

10:23.220 --> 10:25.063
then it's irreversible.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.062
Do you have the keys?

10:29.220 --> 10:30.426
Yeah.

10:30.660 --> 10:31.946
Handy?

10:32.300 --> 10:33.426
Right here.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.586
Can you unlock
the car, please?

10:35.660 --> 10:36.821
It's unlocked.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.460
No, it's not.

10:38.820 --> 10:39.981
There.

11:31.340 --> 11:32.865
Let's just get
in the car.

11:37.220 --> 11:38.585
What the fuck
was that all about?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.868
I don't know.
He didn't tell me.

11:40.940 --> 11:43.307
You know, we don't have a whole lot
of time before commencement, Shane.

11:43.380 --> 11:46.509
All right.
We'll be fine, I promise.

12:02.900 --> 12:03.901
Yeah.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.743
I've been calling.
Why didn't you pick up?

12:10.260 --> 12:11.750
What do you want?

12:20.620 --> 12:22.668
You can't go out there. You
know how dangerous it is...

12:22.740 --> 12:24.265
You need to go.
You need to leave.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.110
It's late.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.503
Don't do this.

12:33.260 --> 12:36.025
It won't make you
feel any better.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.263
Go with your new husband,

12:40.940 --> 12:43.227
and your new family.

12:44.660 --> 12:46.264
Leave.

12:53.660 --> 12:55.424
Just stay safe.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.224
You, too.

13:22.140 --> 13:24.507
<i>Whatever happened
to "Give me your needy,</i>

13:25.700 --> 13:27.907
<i>"your tired,</i>

13:27.980 --> 13:32.269
<i>"your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free"?</i>

13:32.980 --> 13:35.711
<i>The redistribution
of wealth upward</i>

13:35.780 --> 13:37.669
<i>through killing

13:38.780 --> 13:40.589
<i>We must pick up arms.</i>

13:42.820 --> 13:45.664
<i>This year,
we will fight back!</i>

14:37.380 --> 14:39.587
Jeez, that guy
freaked me out.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.902
Did not
see him coming.

14:42.060 --> 14:44.870
I thought we decided
it was irreversible.

14:47.340 --> 14:49.946
No, you often decide
things on your own,

14:50.020 --> 14:52.148
and then pretend that they
were a joint decision.

14:52.260 --> 14:53.625
You often agree with me,

14:53.700 --> 14:54.826
and then
a week later say,

14:54.900 --> 14:56.420
"I don't remember
doing that."

14:56.500 --> 14:57.740
So, you're calling
me a liar?

14:57.900 --> 14:59.823
And you're calling
me a bully.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.064
Just say you changed
your mind,

15:02.140 --> 15:04.586
not that we didn't come
to a joint decision.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.104
This is the exact...

15:14.780 --> 15:17.863
See, this is exactly why we
need to tell your sister

15:17.940 --> 15:19.351
that we're separating.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.862
You're right,
it'll make it real,

15:21.940 --> 15:24.102
but I think we need
to make it real.

15:24.260 --> 15:26.501
Maybe I don't wanna
make it real.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.621
What the hell is that?

15:33.700 --> 15:34.861
The power steering's gone.

15:34.940 --> 15:36.385
What do you mean
"the power steering's gone"?

15:36.460 --> 15:38.269
I don't know. There's
something wrong with the car.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.422
Can you pull over?
I'm trying.

15:50.860 --> 15:51.986
Shit.

15:52.060 --> 15:53.505
Try it again.

15:58.380 --> 16:00.030
It's dead.

16:23.300 --> 16:27.066
<i>The sixth Annual
Purge will begin in 45 minutes.</i>

16:45.820 --> 16:46.901
Just in case.

16:47.060 --> 16:48.107
Yeah.

16:51.460 --> 16:52.541
Hey-

16:53.420 --> 16:55.149
We're gonna be fine.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.504
Just like every year.

16:58.780 --> 17:00.191
Yeah.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.061
I'll pay three times as much
if you just come out here...

17:04.220 --> 17:06.507
No, no, no. I don't care about the car.
We just need a ride.

17:06.579 --> 17:07.780
It's... Hello?
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

17:08.780 --> 17:10.669
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:13.380 --> 17:15.064
Stop!
Shit.

17:15.220 --> 17:16.585
Please!

17:19.060 --> 17:21.540
Shane, we can't be stuck outside.
I know. I know.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.141
We're downtown. Everyone
comes downtown to Purge.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.869
Hey, hey.
Don't worry.

17:26.020 --> 17:28.500
We'll figure something
out, I promise.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.182
Is that coming
from our car?

17:37.620 --> 17:39.224
Oh, shit.

18:12.260 --> 18:14.388
He cut
those wires, Shane.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.507
Yeah.

18:22.340 --> 18:23.751
We need to run.

18:23.820 --> 18:24.821
Yeah, go, go.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.104

He hates this.

22:24.420 --> 22:25.910
I have no idea.
Okay.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.909
Let's just get out of here.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.469
Oh, God! Let's get out of here.
Go!

22:36.900 --> 22:38.390
Here, get in this.
Get in this!

22:38.540 --> 22:40.907
We'll just hide in here.
Come on.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.540
- Go.
- Oh, God!

22:47.900 --> 22:49.186
Let's just get
out of here.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.711
Come on, come on.
You're good.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.111
Fuck, it's them.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.221
We gotta move, we gotta move.
We gotta move.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.863
I'm gonna go get
Papa for dinner.

23:36.020 --> 23:37.351
He said don't bother him.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.787
Yeah. I just wanna see
if he's awake.

23:45.620 --> 23:46.860
Mom!

23:47.780 --> 23:49.669
What? What is it?
Mom, come here!

23:50.780 --> 23:51.827
What's wrong?

23:52.380 --> 23:53.381
Where's Papa?

23:53.540 --> 23:54.780
Look at this.

23:56.780 --> 23:59.147
<i>"Dearest Eva and Cali,</i>

23:59.300 --> 24:02.463
<i>"my greatest heartache is seeing
the two girls I love so much</i>

24:02.540 --> 24:04.508
<i>"struggling in this world.</i>

24:05.260 --> 24:08.343
<i>"I am dying, you know this.</i>

24:09.540 --> 24:13.181

<i>"Survive the night and live a safe life.</i>

24:28.780 --> 24:30.191
<i>"I love you."</i>

24:32.260 --> 24:36.788
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.023
I don't understand.

24:57.580 --> 25:00.424
It's how the wealthy Purge, baby.

25:01.380 --> 25:04.031
They buy poor
and sick people,

25:04.100 --> 25:05.829
and they take them
in their homes

25:05.900 --> 25:08.551
and they kill them
where they're safe.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.870
Oh, my God.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.906
It's just
like Carmelo said.

25:14.820 --> 25:17.340
Why would Papa do that? I don't
understand why he would do that.

25:18.940 --> 25:20.101
Okay, he must have
left something

25:20.220 --> 25:21.381
that could tell us
where he went.

25:21.460 --> 25:23.580
Cali. Cali. Like his phone.
We should call his phone.

25:23.660 --> 25:24.900
We could stop him.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.540
- Cali...
- Okay, that's fine.

25:26.580 --> 25:28.230
We can do something about this.
I don't know what,

25:28.340 --> 25:29.671
but we can still do something about it.
Cali, stop.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.071
Just stop. He's gone.

25:32.100 --> 25:33.545
He's gone.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.908
What is this?

26:18.580 --> 26:20.025
Who are they?
It looks like an army.

26:20.180 --> 26:22.262
I have no idea.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.704
It's them.
No, it can't be them.

26:26.860 --> 26:27.941
They haven't even
come inside yet.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.182
That was right in the other room.

26:36.740 --> 26:37.946
Eva!

26:38.900 --> 26:40.709
I'm here to protect you.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.588
Protect you from me.

26:43.660 --> 26:46.311
Mom, where's the gun?

26:48.900 --> 26:50.664
It's in the kitchen.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.989
Where you hiding, bitch?

27:18.540 --> 27:21.828
Don't you know that you gotta be
polite to people in this society?

27:22.860 --> 27:24.510
Because if not,

27:25.660 --> 27:27.822
this is what
happens tonight!

27:28.180 --> 27:31.901
Diego, don't come back here. We
have guns and we will shoot you.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.265
Cali?

27:35.020 --> 27:36.670
<i>That you?</i>

27:38.460 --> 27:40.622
Oh, I got a little bonus.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.590
Got a little package deal.

27:44.300 --> 27:48.350
But I'll tell you what, tonight
I'm gonna release the beast,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.980
on the both of you
fucking lame bitches!

27:51.980 --> 27:53.789
It's my right,

27:53.860 --> 27:56.989
granted to me by
the New Found Fathers!

28:08.300 --> 28:09.904
You thought your little
weak-ass protection

28:09.980 --> 28:11.948
was gonna keep me
out or what, huh?

28:12.340 --> 28:13.387
Let me tell you something.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.303
Not with the
barricade buster.

28:16.460 --> 28:18.741
Saved up a lot of pennies for
this bitch, let me tell you.

28:18.900 --> 28:20.425
Diego, don't you hear those
people in our building?

28:20.580 --> 28:22.230
Now you shut
the fuck up!

28:24.540 --> 28:27.220
The only thing you gotta be concerned
with is who wants to go first.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.540
Huh?

28:28.820 --> 28:29.821
Who?

28:29.980 --> 28:31.061
Leave my daughter alone.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.141
Mom, don't.

28:32.300 --> 28:33.904
You can do what you want to me, Diego.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.586
I will. Trust me
when I tell you, I will.

28:36.740 --> 28:38.344
You better prepare
yourself tonight,

28:38.460 --> 28:40.861
'cause tonight, it's
motherfucking on, bitch.

28:40.940 --> 28:42.669
That's right, because
it's Diego's night!

28:42.740 --> 28:45.266
It's my night to
motherfucking Purge!

28:46.020 --> 28:47.749
My fucking time!

29:14.220 --> 29:17.269
Every fucking day, you
pass me by in the hallway,

29:17.340 --> 29:18.865
like I ain't shit!

29:19.580 --> 29:23.710
Well, now, that shit fucking changes!
I change shit!

29:24.620 --> 29:25.985
I beg you, please!

29:26.260 --> 29:28.228
Oh, fucking beg, bitch!
Please...

29:28.380 --> 29:30.348
You fucking beg! Beg!

29:30.500 --> 29:32.946
Please! I'm saying please!

29:33.140 --> 29:34.301
Beg, yeah.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.910
Don't touch my daughter, please.

29:35.980 --> 29:37.266
Please,
leave her alone.

29:37.380 --> 29:39.303
Let me hear you say please. She's
got nothing to do with it.

29:39.380 --> 29:40.745
Please.

29:43.220 --> 29:44.824
What's that? Huh?

29:45.420 --> 29:46.945
Is it your father?
I don't know.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.029
- Is that your father?
- Please, please.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.065
I like that.

29:55.580 --> 29:58.550
Come on, motherfucker!
You want some, too?

29:58.700 --> 30:00.031
Come and get it!

30:00.380 --> 30:01.427
Where you at?

30:29.340 --> 30:30.671
Is it him?

30:45.500 --> 30:47.060
This is what
he was looking for tonight.

30:47.100 --> 30:48.864
Let's bring these
two downstairs.

30:49.020 --> 30:51.705
<i>Big Daddy, we have
two for your personal Purge.</i>

30:51.780 --> 30:53.384
<i>Bringing them down now.</i>

30:56.820 --> 30:57.867
Get off me!

31:08.180 --> 31:09.386
Cali!

31:42.220 --> 31:43.267
No! No!

31:43.340 --> 31:44.341
Cali!

31:45.340 --> 31:47.342
Oh, God, no! Let go!

31:47.500 --> 31:49.025
No!

31:49.180 --> 31:51.547
Get the fuck off me!

31:51.700 --> 31:53.225
Please!

31:53.340 --> 31:54.387
Leave my daughter alone!

32:02.060 --> 32:04.028
Please, don't.
Please, please, please.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.908
Just drive. Just drive.
Just drive.

32:23.260 --> 32:24.830
Get off of me!

32:24.900 --> 32:25.901
Mom!

32:31.340 --> 32:33.547
Just fucking drive.

32:33.700 --> 32:36.180
Please!
Let my daughter go!

32:36.340 --> 32:37.501
Cali!

32:37.580 --> 32:38.911
No, fucking...

32:39.660 --> 32:40.946
Mom!

32:41.580 --> 32:42.741
Mom!

33:25.220 --> 33:27.348
I don't know.
They were right behind us.

33:28.780 --> 33:29.781
What the fuck is that?

33:31.340 --> 33:33.024
Shit.
What do we do?

33:34.220 --> 33:36.382
Here, get in.
It's open.

33:43.820 --> 33:45.060
No!

33:50.180 --> 33:51.545
Get off!

34:12.940 --> 34:14.146
What is going on
out there?

34:14.300 --> 34:16.260
We're safe, we're safe. We're in here.
We're good.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.109
Let's go.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.264
- Hey! Out of the car!
- No, no, no!

35:09.420 --> 35:10.660
Please! Please, don't!

35:10.820 --> 35:12.470
Get out of the car,
or I will shoot!

35:12.620 --> 35:14.224
We're not Purging! We don't
have any weapons! Please.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.064
- I will shoot you!
- Please don't shoot!

35:16.220 --> 35:17.381
Move out
of the car now!

35:17.460 --> 35:18.541
No,
we're not armed!

35:18.740 --> 35:19.901
Get out of the car!

35:19.980 --> 35:21.061
We can't!
They're after us!

35:21.220 --> 35:23.746
Wait, wait, wait. We have to go!
We have to go, please!

35:24.340 --> 35:26.024
We don't wanna
hurt anybody!

35:26.340 --> 35:28.308
Please, don't...
Shut up! Shut up!

35:28.460 --> 35:29.621
Hands up,
and shut your mouth!

35:30.300 --> 35:31.381
- Please. Please.
- Hands are up!

35:31.460 --> 35:32.540
Thank you,
thank you.

35:32.660 --> 35:33.980
Get in, get in, get in.

35:39.660 --> 35:41.742
Shane?
What?

35:44.420 --> 35:46.024
They're coming.
We gotta go!

35:46.700 --> 35:47.701
Over there, too!

35:47.780 --> 35:50.220
There's people over here, too!
You gotta move, you gotta move!

35:50.380 --> 35:51.381
Please, go! Please.

35:53.340 --> 35:54.421
Shut up!

35:54.500 --> 35:55.501
Drive!

36:15.340 --> 36:17.580
He's shooting at the motorcycles.
They're turning!

36:30.260 --> 36:31.307
They're not following us.

36:31.380 --> 36:32.905
They're gone, they're gone.
They're all gone.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.261
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:34.340 --> 36:35.341
Yeah, there's no one there!

36:35.420 --> 36:36.467
Are you okay, baby?

36:36.540 --> 36:37.871
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you?

36:38.300 --> 36:39.347
Yeah.

36:40.020 --> 36:41.545
Sir, are you okay?

36:43.700 --> 36:45.862
You. What was that army
doing in your building?

36:45.980 --> 36:46.981
Why were they afier you?
I don't know.

36:47.060 --> 36:48.060
Why were
they after you?

36:48.100 --> 36:49.147
I don't know!
I don't know.

36:50.020 --> 36:51.943
Why are you in the streets?
Our car just broke down.

36:52.020 --> 36:54.261
We're not out to Purge. We
don't wanna hurt anybody.

36:54.340 --> 36:56.707
Are you armed?
No! No!

36:56.900 --> 36:59.585
What about you? What
were you doing outside?

37:25.300 --> 37:26.745
Oh, God.

37:27.140 --> 37:30.110
Look, Mom... Mom, it's okay.
We're safe now.

37:30.260 --> 37:31.785
No, we're not.

37:32.940 --> 37:35.147
Sir, where are we going?

37:35.900 --> 37:38.904
Honestly, anywhere but here
is fine with me. Just...

37:40.860 --> 37:42.624
God damn it.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.742
Maybe nowhere.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.301
Whoever's in that truck was
using armor piercing bullets.

38:20.380 --> 38:21.586
The car is dead.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.310
So, that's it. We're stuck
outside on Purge Night.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.501
What are we gonna do?

38:24.740 --> 38:28.506
Can we just hide in here? We
have seven hours until morning.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.544
There's hunters
out there with dogs.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.827
Sooner or later,
they're gonna find you.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.461
But you do what you want.

38:36.340 --> 38:37.705
You're on your own now.
Huh?

38:38.140 --> 38:39.266
What?
Whoa!

38:39.860 --> 38:41.460
Whoa, what do you mean,
we're on our own?

38:41.500 --> 38:43.628
I should never have gotten involved.
It's none of my business.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.782
Okay, but you did, so it is
your business now, all right?

38:45.900 --> 38:46.947
So, what are
we all going to do?

38:47.020 --> 38:49.591
Take this.
It's loaded. Take it.

38:50.860 --> 38:53.067
Take it. You're just
giving us guns?

38:56.740 --> 38:57.821
Where are you going?

38:57.940 --> 38:59.430
I got somewhere to be
before the sun comes up.

38:59.620 --> 39:01.110
I can't take you with me,
you'll slow me down.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.228
So, you're really just
gonna leave us here?

39:05.740 --> 39:08.789
Stay off the streets.
Find somewhere to go.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.021
Please, take us
with you.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.023
We are not the kind of people
who will survive tonight.

39:12.220 --> 39:13.506
Let him go, all right?
He doesn't wanna help.

39:13.580 --> 39:14.866
- Shane, shut up!
- Let him...

39:15.020 --> 39:18.149
Why did you save us if you were
just gonna leave us here to die?

39:18.300 --> 39:19.540
Please, help us!

39:19.700 --> 39:21.429
Wait!
I can get you a car.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.980
I have a friend in the city
not far from here.

39:26.340 --> 39:28.229
I've worked
with her for years.

39:28.380 --> 39:30.189
If you get us
there safely,

39:30.340 --> 39:33.628
you can take her car
and do what you have to do.

39:34.260 --> 39:35.750
Where does she live?

39:36.700 --> 39:38.145
Third and Bryant.

39:38.300 --> 39:40.029
Will she give me her car?
Mmm-hmm.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.301
Are you sure?

39:41.860 --> 39:42.907
Mmm-hmm.

39:43.780 --> 39:44.986
Make sure.

39:47.420 --> 39:48.581
Okay-

39:54.540 --> 39:56.508
Hey, it's Eva.

39:56.980 --> 39:58.391
Listen,
we're in trouble.

39:58.540 --> 40:00.668
That was a real
dick move, you know?

40:00.740 --> 40:02.105
Walking away
and then coming back.

40:02.260 --> 40:05.230
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Okay, we'll be there really soon.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.951
And listen,
I need your car as well.

40:09.300 --> 40:11.826
I'll explain when I get
there, is that okay?

40:11.980 --> 40:13.391
What are you looking for?

40:14.140 --> 40:15.426
Snipers.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.662
Thank you
so much. Okay.

40:23.700 --> 40:26.101
Uh, she lives with her parents.
They're happy to have us.

40:26.580 --> 40:30.346
If you can get us to her place
safely, the car is yours.

40:30.420 --> 40:31.785
Can she help us, too?

40:32.340 --> 40:33.466
Yeah.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.226
Thank you.

40:36.580 --> 40:37.786
She'll give me the car?

40:41.100 --> 40:43.671
All right, I'm gonna help you get to
your friend's, but I want that car.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.140
I know.

40:46.180 --> 40:48.103
All right, you listen to what I say.
You stay close.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.786
You slow me down, I cut you
all loose, you understand?

40:50.900 --> 40:52.140
Yeah. Yeah.

40:55.900 --> 40:58.949
Okay. Let's go.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.304
<i>I'm doing God's work.</i>

41:25.220 --> 41:28.269
<i>He uses an earthquake,
a virus.</i>

41:29.780 --> 41:31.703
<i>Population under control.</i>

41:31.780 --> 41:33.862
<i>The masses nourish
and flourish.</i>

41:35.100 --> 41:37.387
<i>I am that virus tonight.</i>

41:38.140 --> 41:41.428
<i>I am a one-woman
fucking plague</i>

41:41.500 --> 41:43.070
<i>and you're all in my path!</i>

41:44.620 --> 41:46.941
<i>I am the Holy Trinity.
Oh, I am the Holy Trinity.</i>

41:47.020 --> 41:48.306
<i>I am the Holy Trinity.</i>

41:48.380 --> 41:51.987
<i>I am the Father Fucker, Son
of a Bitch, and Holy Shit!</i>

41:52.060 --> 41:55.860
When I move, you move, understand?
Stay close, don't stray.

41:56.420 --> 41:57.421
Okay?
Yeah.

41:57.500 --> 42:02.631
<i>And my MP-9 silver-tipped
Auto Magnum.</i>

42:02.700 --> 42:06.500
<i>The right arm of the free world
and the left hand of God!</i>

42:06.660 --> 42:07.866
Go!

42:09.860 --> 42:15.310
<i>In flaming fire, I take the heads
of them that know not God.</i>

42:15.660 --> 42:18.186
We're gonna go down Fifth. Your
friend's building is close.

42:18.380 --> 42:19.506
Go through
the business district,

42:19.580 --> 42:21.867
stay away from
the gangs downtown.

42:25.580 --> 42:27.230
Wait a minute.

42:38.580 --> 42:40.742
Stay back, stay back.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.791
No! Please, don't!

42:46.700 --> 42:49.704
No! No!

42:50.380 --> 42:51.541
What are they doing?
Where are they taking him?

42:51.700 --> 42:52.701
It's not our business.

42:52.780 --> 42:55.067
Those are the guys
that were after us.

42:55.180 --> 42:56.820
It's okay.
It's not our problem.

42:57.180 --> 42:58.545
We're gonna have
people in front of us,

42:58.620 --> 43:00.100
and we're gonna have
people behind us.

43:00.180 --> 43:01.909
As long as we move,
we'll be fine.

43:02.060 --> 43:03.266
We're gonna cross Banks.

43:03.340 --> 43:04.580
No, no, no,
that's the long way.

43:04.660 --> 43:06.460
It's gonna be much quicker
if we go down here.

43:12.580 --> 43:13.627
What is this?

43:14.020 --> 43:15.590
Get it off of me,
I'm stuck!

43:15.740 --> 43:16.901
It's a trap. It's a trap.
We don't have time.

43:17.060 --> 43:18.380
Move away, I gotta shoot it.
What?

43:18.460 --> 43:19.460
What?
You're gonna what?

43:19.500 --> 43:20.501
I'm gonna shoot it. Move!

43:20.620 --> 43:21.667
What?
Okay.

43:24.420 --> 43:25.546
Shoot it! Shoot the cable!

43:29.140 --> 43:30.221
Shoot it!

43:32.460 --> 43:34.064
Shane, hurry up!

43:34.580 --> 43:35.741
Get up, get up!

43:45.580 --> 43:47.184
- Move!
- Okay, let's go!

43:58.580 --> 44:00.742
<i>There are six
hours remaining in this year's...</i>

44:02.660 --> 44:06.301
<i>The NFFA pigs are wrong.
They're fucking wrong!</i>

44:07.420 --> 44:10.742
<i>Profit-making is not
the essence of democracy.</i>

44:11.260 --> 44:15.231
<i>Wake up, people. Wake up!
It's time to take a stand.</i>

44:16.100 --> 44:19.104
<i>Tonight, we write
our message in blood.</i>

44:19.540 --> 44:21.349
<i>Their blood!</i>

44:27.420 --> 44:29.229
It's so quiet here.

44:29.540 --> 44:31.383
The business district's
always quiet on Purge Night.

44:31.460 --> 44:34.270
The banks move their money,
so no one's ever down here.

44:34.540 --> 44:35.905
Let's go.

44:45.580 --> 44:46.706
Stop.

44:52.020 --> 44:53.943
We don't even
know your names.

44:54.060 --> 44:55.550
I'm Liz, and this is Shane.

44:55.700 --> 44:56.747
Hi.

44:56.820 --> 44:58.709
Eva. My daughter, Cali.

44:58.900 --> 45:01.983
It's nice to officially meet
you on this shitty night.

45:02.060 --> 45:03.061
Yeah.

45:05.340 --> 45:07.866
Is anyone else kind of
curious about this guy?

45:08.340 --> 45:10.024
I'm just glad that
he's out here with us.

45:10.220 --> 45:11.221
Yeah, me, too.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.746
But we all got stuck out
here, and he chose to be.

45:13.820 --> 45:14.981
That means
he's Purging.

45:15.140 --> 45:17.029
Hey. Let's go.

45:17.580 --> 45:20.345
Are you saying that
we shouldn't trust him?

45:20.460 --> 45:21.905
He saved our lives.

45:21.980 --> 45:23.903
All I'm saying is
that he's out here

45:23.980 --> 45:26.870
armed to the teeth, on
Purge Night, voluntarily.

45:27.020 --> 45:28.590
That means he's trying
to do something nasty.

45:28.660 --> 45:30.185
I can hear you.

45:32.300 --> 45:34.906
Sorry. Just go.

45:41.380 --> 45:43.542
Hey, are you
doing okay?

45:45.620 --> 45:48.544
Yeah. Yeah.
It's gonna be fine.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.945
I'm gonna go talk to him.

45:52.100 --> 45:53.261
Cali.

45:54.340 --> 45:55.341
Cali...

45:55.540 --> 45:57.429
What's your name?
Shh.

46:00.660 --> 46:02.901
You're good with guns.

46:02.980 --> 46:05.142
I'm guessing you're either
a cop or a criminal, huh?

46:05.340 --> 46:09.743
And I'm guessing you're either a
pain in my ass or a pain in my ass.

46:12.500 --> 46:14.628
You're out here
to do it, aren't you?

46:14.980 --> 46:18.826
To Purge? That's what you
have to do later on, right?

46:18.900 --> 46:19.901
What are you gonna do?

46:20.020 --> 46:21.260
Stop.

46:21.340 --> 46:24.344
New rules. You shut up.

46:25.180 --> 46:28.343
All of you, shut up.

46:28.420 --> 46:30.707
I'm gonna stop talking because
you're being an asshole, okay?

46:30.780 --> 46:31.906
Not because you
told me to shut up.

46:31.980 --> 46:33.141
Cali.

46:34.180 --> 46:35.511
Hey, hey, hey-

46:37.580 --> 46:38.911
Okay-

46:47.140 --> 46:48.426
Oh, my God.

46:48.500 --> 46:53.062
"Here hangs stockbroker David
Neustadter. He stole our pensions.

46:53.260 --> 46:55.262
"Now, he's gone."

46:58.260 --> 46:59.864
Maybe David deserved it.

47:02.260 --> 47:04.183
Just a bad joke.

47:20.460 --> 47:22.383
What the hell is that?

47:26.420 --> 47:27.990
Is that tear gas?

47:28.140 --> 47:30.142
Smoke canister.

47:30.340 --> 47:32.991
Stay close,
stay close, stay close.

47:38.500 --> 47:39.740
Help me!

47:39.980 --> 47:41.789
Grab him! Get off her!

47:41.940 --> 47:42.987
Get off her!

47:46.700 --> 47:48.668
We were just
doing our duty.

47:48.860 --> 47:49.861
Is she okay?

47:50.020 --> 47:51.021
He scared
the shit out of me.

47:51.100 --> 47:52.300
All right.
You're okay, though.

47:53.260 --> 47:55.380
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Just take a breath.

47:57.020 --> 47:58.351
Look at his uniform.

48:00.060 --> 48:02.586
This is one of the bastards
who came into our building.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.144
And that looks
like their truck.

48:06.020 --> 48:08.261
All right, stay here.
Stay here.

48:10.100 --> 48:11.864
<i>Truck 3, come in.</i>

48:17.580 --> 48:18.741
<i>Come in, please.</i>

48:18.780 --> 48:20.464
Come on. Come on,
let's go, let's go.

48:20.620 --> 48:22.827
Just stay together.
Let's go.

48:23.020 --> 48:24.351
Oh, Jesus.

48:25.100 --> 48:28.104
<i>Truck 3, please respond!</i>

48:28.620 --> 48:31.351
Go check the cab,
see if this thing's working.

48:31.500 --> 48:33.180
Stay alert. Stay alert.

48:35.540 --> 48:37.542
Go ahead.
Go. Go, go, go.

48:37.740 --> 48:39.424
This is some
high-tech shit.

48:41.180 --> 48:42.545
Yo, somebody spent
a lot of money

48:42.620 --> 48:44.748
trying to do some
heavy-duty Purging.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.420
Look at this. They're accessing
the city's traffic cams.

48:48.860 --> 48:50.430
Looking for targets,
l guess.

48:50.580 --> 48:52.628
Traffic cams are controlled
by the government.

48:52.780 --> 48:54.270
How did they
get into these?

48:54.420 --> 48:55.910
I mean,
who are these people?

48:55.980 --> 48:58.187
Maybe you just answered
your own question.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.787
Look at this.
Seventh Street.

49:00.940 --> 49:02.271
Is that your building?

49:02.420 --> 49:03.910
Yeah, but why
is it all red?

49:03.980 --> 49:05.220
You're being targeted
for something,

49:05.300 --> 49:06.426
along with all
these other buildings.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.309
Here, here.
All over the city.

49:08.380 --> 49:09.620
All around
the projects.

49:10.220 --> 49:11.551
Maybe you
were right, Cali.

49:11.700 --> 49:14.101
Look, I'm telling you, this
is the New Founding Fathers.

49:14.180 --> 49:15.341
- The government...
- The truck is fucked.

49:15.420 --> 49:18.469
No good? No, the engine's
all blown out or something.

49:20.060 --> 49:21.221
Hey, look at this.

49:22.940 --> 49:24.430
That's Carmelo's mark, Mom.

49:26.580 --> 49:28.070
I told Papa
he was the real deal.

49:28.140 --> 49:29.585
His group took
these fuckers out.

49:29.660 --> 49:30.980
Everybody got a weapon?

49:33.500 --> 49:36.583
Hey, grab this. Take the weapon.
Go. Go!

49:37.380 --> 49:38.791
Go! Oh, shit, there's
another one.

49:38.940 --> 49:40.305
Looks like an army.
Come on.

49:40.460 --> 49:42.303
Get down, let's go.

50:34.260 --> 50:35.421
Take this.

50:38.700 --> 50:39.747
Shh.

51:33.180 --> 51:34.784
Come on.

52:01.340 --> 52:02.501
Hey-

52:02.580 --> 52:05.311
Why did you stop
at our building?

52:05.380 --> 52:07.348
Why did you help us?

52:08.980 --> 52:11.426
Didn't we establish
a no-talking rule?

52:12.220 --> 52:14.871
People are getting
killed all over the city.

52:14.940 --> 52:16.908
Why did you stop for us?

52:19.100 --> 52:22.900
I saw you. You were putting
up a hell of a fight.

52:24.060 --> 52:26.028
You reminded me
of someone.

52:26.980 --> 52:28.141
Who?

52:31.980 --> 52:36.588
Look, Purging, no matter
what the reason, is wrong.

52:37.060 --> 52:38.949
Killing doesn't
help anything.

52:39.020 --> 52:40.067
It doesn't heal someone.

52:40.220 --> 52:42.461
Enough. Enough.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.821
Go back with
your mommy.

52:47.900 --> 52:49.311
Go.

53:08.340 --> 53:10.502
There's no air in here.

53:18.580 --> 53:20.582
Come over here.
Put this on.

53:20.740 --> 53:22.185
I don't need that.
Put it on, I said.

53:22.260 --> 53:24.069
I said I don't need it.
Put it on.

53:28.460 --> 53:30.383
Put your arm
through here.

53:34.100 --> 53:36.228
Now, hopefully,
you won't need it.

53:37.740 --> 53:39.344
Let's move.

53:47.700 --> 53:49.065
- What was that?
- Shh.

53:58.260 --> 53:59.750
There's no threat.

53:59.940 --> 54:02.386
They're just trying to
make it through the night.

54:03.180 --> 54:04.864
Keep moving.

54:12.100 --> 54:13.750
Hey, are you okay?

54:13.900 --> 54:15.823
I just wanna
get out of here.

54:33.900 --> 54:35.106
Oh, shit!

54:36.380 --> 54:37.461
Move!

54:37.780 --> 54:39.145
Go! Come on!

54:46.980 --> 54:48.345
Run! Move!

55:00.740 --> 55:01.866
Move!

55:07.500 --> 55:09.662
Get up! Get up!
Come on!

55:09.820 --> 55:11.060
Get up, get up, get up!

55:11.260 --> 55:13.501
Mom, we have
to go right now!

55:13.900 --> 55:15.743
Move it,
move it! Move!

55:21.340 --> 55:22.865
Go, go!

55:26.660 --> 55:27.741
Up. up, up!

55:36.060 --> 55:39.143
We're not gonna make it.
Fuck it.

55:43.100 --> 55:44.261
Shane!

55:45.220 --> 55:46.790
- What are you doing?
- Get down!

55:46.940 --> 55:48.942
What do we do?
Just shoot! Just shoot!

55:58.940 --> 56:00.146
Shane!

56:06.260 --> 56:08.308
Oh, my God. I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine!

56:08.460 --> 56:10.462
Just keep shooting. Just
keep shooting. Go! Go!

56:28.300 --> 56:30.985
All right. You're okay.

56:31.860 --> 56:33.021
Stay here.
Give me this.

56:33.180 --> 56:36.707
I'm so sorry. I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

56:37.460 --> 56:39.303
I was just so scared.

56:41.580 --> 56:42.866
You're bleeding.

56:42.940 --> 56:44.340
I cut it on the platform.
It's fine.

56:44.380 --> 56:45.506
We'll help you.
Just tell us...

56:45.580 --> 56:46.627
I said, it's fine!

56:48.660 --> 56:49.786
Get up. Get up.

56:54.460 --> 56:56.269
What's taking
them so long?

57:07.820 --> 57:10.630
Help! He's been shot!
I have no idea how bad.

57:13.500 --> 57:15.309
Open up.
We're gonna be fine, okay?

57:15.460 --> 57:18.703
Call your friend. Tell her we're close.
We're gonna get him up.

57:18.860 --> 57:21.147
Okay. Look at me.
Look at me, Shane. Yeah?

57:21.300 --> 57:23.541
One, two, three.
Get him up.

57:23.620 --> 57:25.031
Let's go!

57:32.540 --> 57:34.827
<i>There are
four hours and 30 minutes</i>

57:34.900 --> 57:37.301
<i>remaining in
this year's Purge.</i>

57:37.460 --> 57:40.942
Go! Just don't worry! Go!
Come on, come on!

57:45.300 --> 57:46.506
Keep moving!

57:46.660 --> 57:49.664
Go! Don't slow down!
Keep moving!

57:50.060 --> 57:51.107
It's right up ahead.

57:51.180 --> 57:52.670
Come on!

57:52.820 --> 57:54.822
Cali! Slow down!

58:04.020 --> 58:05.909
Hey, look,
that's her building!

58:05.980 --> 58:07.823
She said to meet
around the back.

58:18.500 --> 58:20.309
<i>We have a
target match on the civilians</i>

58:20.380 --> 58:23.111
<i>who attacked Truck 2.</i>

58:31.420 --> 58:34.026
She said,
"Meet us around the back."

58:36.300 --> 58:37.631
Tanya! Let us in!

58:38.180 --> 58:39.864
It's Eva and Cali!

58:43.300 --> 58:45.348
Holy shit!
You guys look like hell.

58:45.500 --> 58:47.582
Come on, come on, hurry up.
Get in here. Hurry up!

58:47.740 --> 58:49.902
Thank you. I don't like
being out here. Come on.

58:55.460 --> 58:56.666
All right.

58:58.580 --> 59:00.230
Bullet went right through.

59:03.420 --> 59:05.184
I can't believe you guys
went through all that stuff.

59:05.340 --> 59:06.990
It's just insane!

59:08.180 --> 59:10.626
Get him to the hospital first
thing after this is over.

59:10.700 --> 59:12.623
Yeah.
You'll be okay.

59:12.700 --> 59:14.623
It's gonna hurt like a son of a
bitch, but you're gonna be okay.

59:14.700 --> 59:17.021
Thanks.
I can't thank you enough.

59:17.180 --> 59:19.023
That's what you get
for being a hero.

59:28.220 --> 59:30.029
I need the car.
I know.

59:30.180 --> 59:31.545
Come on, everybody.
Eat, drink!

59:31.620 --> 59:33.349
Yes,
I recommend drinking.

59:33.420 --> 59:35.180
It's the best way to get
through the evening.

59:35.460 --> 59:36.621
And the food
is delicious.

59:36.700 --> 59:37.820
My mother's
a wonderful cook.

59:37.980 --> 59:39.584
My sister's
a testament to that.

59:39.780 --> 59:41.384
What the hell
does that mean?

59:41.460 --> 59:43.462
That she's
a good cook!

59:43.540 --> 59:44.985
You know, you didn't
have to go this far.

59:45.060 --> 59:46.824
Just having us here
was really enough.

59:46.900 --> 59:48.902
You guys have had
a terrible night.

59:49.060 --> 59:50.346
Get some food
in your system,

59:50.420 --> 59:52.024
and we'll get through
this together.

59:52.180 --> 59:53.306
Excuse me.

59:54.740 --> 59:56.105
Cali?

59:56.180 --> 59:58.911
I can't believe
nobody's drinking with me.

59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.186
What about you, tough guy?

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.347
Want a drink?

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.701
No, thanks.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.269
Okay-

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:06.830
You're really going
back out there?

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.821
Mmm!

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.700
Relax! It's my father and my
brother-in-law. He's the super.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.306
They were just checking the building.
It's all good.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.903
Everyone, please don't mind
my husband's clothes.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:23.580
He's not Purging.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.788
He just thought
it was a crazy idea

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:28.147
to go out and see
what's happening tonight.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.460
Yeah, I chickened out.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.788
No way
I was going out there.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.942
I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.501
Thank God he came to his senses.
I mean, look at him.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:39.550
He would've been the laughingstock
of the neighborhood.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.062
That's not very nice,
Lorraine.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.911
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for it to be mean.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.903
It's not mean,
it's just true.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.386
How's everything, Daddy?

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.541
It's all good, baby.

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.828
The building's
locked down and good.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.146
It's quiet.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:58.065
I see you had a rough
go of it, my friend.

01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.505
- Oh, yeah.
- Relax.

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.981
Make yourself at home.
You're safe here.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.108
We are anti-Purge
in this household.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.342
Speak for yourself, Daddy.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.271
What does that mean?

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.820
I could think of
a couple situations

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.703
where Purging
could be the answer.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.743
- Like when?
- I'm not telling.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.380
I'm just saying,
don't piss me off, bitch.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.542
- Uh, please excuse my daughter.
- No, it's fine.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.425
And, please, if there's anything
else you need, just ask.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.184
I could use a clean shirt.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.462
Down the hall,
second door on the left.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.271
Top drawer of the bureau.
What's mine is yours.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.421
Okay. Excuse me, too.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.030
I'm gonna go to
the little girl's room

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.780
'cause this wine is
going right through me.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.551
Come on, everyone,
please eat and drink.

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.543
Come on. Honey?

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.702
<i>This is News 10 reporting on a
lively Purge Night across the country.</i>

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:26.308
<i>We have riots in
East Los Angeles,</i>

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.826
<i>as well as record
participation in Pittsburgh.</i>

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.745
He wasn't lying.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.267
This shit hurts.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.910
Aw, I'm sorry.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.142
You scared
the shit out of me.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.469
I thought
I was losing you.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:55.984
But I still think we
should tell your sister.

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.346
You're an asshole.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.104
I'm sorry.
That's not funny.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.262
I'm sorry.
No, l got shot.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.940
Oh, are you gonna use this excuse
for the rest of our lives?

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.226
Well, at least
the rest of the night.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.870
Okay.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.784
All right, people, let's change
the atmosphere up in here.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.069
No more Purge news.
No more nothing depressing.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:25.020
Let's put on some music, and let's
just liven it up a little bit, right?

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.780
Come
on, you want to dance?

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.671
Why not?

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.663
Liven up the party,
come on.

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.184
Let's dance.
Let's dance!

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.189
Okay, I gotta go.
I need the car.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.944
I know.
You trust these people?

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.268
Because your friend
likes to drink,

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.910
and she's taking
pills back there.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.546
Yeah, she's pretty wild.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.271
But we'll be okay.
She's a good friend.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.582
What? You don't
wanna do it? What?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.344
Lorraine, do you care
if we dance?

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.229
She doesn't even care. She's
not even paying attention.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.426
Now he's...
Look at him.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.025
He's asleep. He is.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.308
I don't know
how to thank you.

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.587
Okay, if you can just tell her
I need the car right now,

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.629
that would be
really great.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.987
I know what
you're doing tonight.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.184
You're going out there to
kill someone who wronged you.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.666
You believe in this night,
don't you?

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.820
I think you should just
take care of your daughter.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.984
She's special,
and you're very lucky.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.507
And I need the car.

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.624
There is no car.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.865
What?

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.224
I'm sorry,
they don't have a car.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.988
But we needed you.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.265
And I needed the car.

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.866
I did what I had to.
I did it for my daughter.

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.182
I was doing this
for my son.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.503
And I trusted you.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.668
You have no idea what you might
have taken away from me tonight.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.107
Hey-
Hey-

01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.984
Look, I know you're
angry with my mother,

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.909
but I really think you
should just stay here.

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.751
Just wait out
the night with us, okay?

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.150
Look, I heard you say that
you're doing it for your son.

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.020
Now, I don't know him,

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.511
but I'm sure he would
not want you to do

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.100
whatever it is
that you're going to do.

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.023
Bye, Cali. Please, come
on, you're safe here.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:19.670
Get out of my way.
Please, just...

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:20.901
I gotta go. Goodbye.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.300
Stay here. It's fine.
Get out of the way.

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.661
Get back!

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.911
No!

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.027
Lorraine!

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.340
What are you doing?

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.822
Tanya! Tanya!

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.467
Lorraine!

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.141
What've you done? What
are you doing, Lorraine?

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.904
Jesus Christ,
she's dead.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.501
You killed your sister!
She's your sister!

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.866
Lorraine!
What are you doing?

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.141
You know
what I'm doing.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:51.421
I read all your emails,
you cheating motherfuckers.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.230
You both deserve to die!

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.068
Okay, Lorraine!
Lorraine, stop!

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.789
No! Get back, get back.
Back up, back up!

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.021
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.660
What the fuck are you doing?
Lorraine.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.027
If you shoot me,
you shoot this woman.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.261
Just let her go!

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:07.991
You don't
wanna do that!

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.142
Lorraine, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.144
I didn't mean it. She hasn't
done anything to you.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.870
Okay? So, cut this out!

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.384
Fuck you! This is my right,
granted to me by my government.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.505
Leave him alone!
He's mine!

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.190
Door, now. Go.

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.984
Door! Go!

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:35.111
Door, door, door!

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.386
Now!

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.586
Move, move, move!

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.545
Go, go!

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.868
I can't believe
Tanya's dead.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.023
What do we do now?
Where do we go?

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.391
Are you gonna
leave us now?

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:31.821
What?

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.351
Are you gonna
leave us now?

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.110
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.506
Shh!
How did they find us?

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:54.341
Stay here.

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.581
Don't move!

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:16.029
Do you think
he's gonna come back?

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.751
What do we do
if he doesn't?

01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:22.982
Come on, guys.
Let's go, okay?

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.064
We don't have all night. I
want this building surrounded.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:28.621
He's here.

01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:32.421
I know it, and I want him.
Understood?

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.627
He shot me.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.899
He shot half my team.
I want him dead.

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.381
Come on,
come on, come on.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.265
And I want
the two women he saved.

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.785
They're mine.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.828
I want them alive.

01:08:57.899 --> 01:08:59.788
Please come back.

01:09:02.819 --> 01:09:05.426
They found us. Move fast, now.
Come on.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:10.501
Move now.
We have 30 seconds.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.106
Over the fence, fast.
Now. Go!

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.145
Next. Come on,
come on, come on.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.782
Look at me. You go, you get
over that fence, you run.

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:26.100
You don't stop.
You run for your life.

01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.988
Do you understand? You
don't fucking wait for me.

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.188
Go. Go, go, go!

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:35.506
Fuck!

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.829
How did you find us?

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.744
No, Cali, no.

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:33.744
We got lucky.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.380
I mean, we was roaming
around out there all night.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:39.942
Just picking up the people who got
away from those badass trucks.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.791
We get their scraps.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.468
Why haven't you
just killed us already?

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.385
We're not Purging tonight.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:50.791
We don't need
to kill anyone.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.870
We just need money.
Right, bro?

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.545
Money!

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:04.551
Whoa!

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.505
All right, let's go.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.310
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.144
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go!

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.621
No, no, no!

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.466
Who the fuck are they?

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:18.501
What the fuck are
you doing to us?

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:21.101
I need my money, man.
Let's go, let's do this.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:23.228
What are they doing?

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:26.462
It's all there.
Yeah!

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.861
Let's go! Let's go, move!

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.504
- Get in there!
- No!

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:46.669
Cali?
Mom!

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:47.981
Get up the stairs, now.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.989
Get up! Get up!

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.663
Get on your knees.
Get down! Get down!

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.224
Get on your knees.

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.025
On your knees!

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.830
Where are we? What is this? Shh.

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.061
If you move or speak,

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.466
you will be shot.

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:19.707
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
next batch has just arrived.</i>

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.188
<i>Let's take a look,
shall we?</i>

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.987
Quite an impressive lot,
isn't it?

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:56.149
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, since this
is the last Purge of the evening,</i>

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.345
<i>the entry price
will be $200,000.</i>

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.224
<i>Mr. Lockhart!</i>

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.747
<i>And his wonderful wife,
Lauren.</i>

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.830
<i>Fantastic.</i>

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:13.706
<i>The Hanover sisters!</i>

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:14.981
<i>Ah!</i>

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.860
<i>I've been waiting all evening
for your participation.</i>

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.351
<i>Fantastic.</i>

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:23.704
<i>And I assume you brought
your signature blades.</i>

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.587
<i>All right, one spot left.
Anyone else?</i>

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.705
<i>Mr. Hearst!
Oh, wonderful!</i>

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.067
<i>And will your handsome
sons be joining you?</i>

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.340
What do you say, guys?
Yeah, let's do it.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.830
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this will
be Charles and Tom's first.</i>

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:44.628
<i>I am so happy that you have
this to share together.</i>

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.622
<i>Oh, and one last reminder.</i>

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.991
<i>The weapons rack is stocked with
the latest and the greatest.</i>

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.229
<i>And my personal favorite</i>

01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:01.386
<i>is the Mauser Elite
SSX Double Barrel.</i>

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.271
<i>It has a delicate trigger,</i>

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.661
<i>and smoothest discharge.</i>

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:09.870
<i>It is so precise,</i>

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.786
<i>it's as if God handcrafted it himself.</i>

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:16.464
<i>Well, that will do it.</i>

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.783
<i>Purgers, please suit up.</i>

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:21.461
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:25.187
<i>Good luck. We'll see you shortly
on the hunting grounds.</i>

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:29.069
Get up. Come on!
Get up! Get up! Get up!

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.750
Quit stalling!

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.421
Come on!

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.988
- Move your ass!
- Okay!

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.660
Move it! Go!

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.181
Move it!
Get in there!

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:50.783
Stay close to me.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.983
Follow me. Move.

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.630
Get down.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.626
Get down, get down.

01:15:58.780 --> 01:15:59.906
Wait.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.791
What is this?

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.305
We're being hunted.

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.905
What?

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:36.831
Blessed be
the New Founding Fathers

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.346
for letting us Purge
and cleanse our souls.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:43.391
Blessed be America,
a nation reborn.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.950
All right, they're here.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:09.704
They're coming,
and they got night vision.

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.747
I gotta take
one of them down.

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:11.900
If we can't see,
we're dead.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.146
We should
come with you.

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:14.540
No, no, no.
I need you to stay here.

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:15.866
Don't go. I'm scared.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.830
I'm coming back, I'm coming back.
Stay here.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.300
No!

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:20.460
Are you okay?
Fine.

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:23.590
We only get two sets of eyes now, okay?
Put those on.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.583
I took out four
of these fuckers.

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:26.821
There's three left.

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.671
It's loaded.
You point and you shoot.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.826
Someone's coming right at us.

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:32.901
Light him up.

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:46.101
They're going.

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:47.706
They're all gone.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:51.140
They're leaving.
Get down, get down.

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:52.700
Is it over?

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.829
Stay down.

01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:01.110
We need help right now.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.104
They've killed five people.
They've killed five of us.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.990
They're gone.

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.431
What the fuck?

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.264
What was that?

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.186
There's a whole
fucking army.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.826
I don't have
any more bullets.

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.983
Just hold my hand, baby.

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.587
They're not
gonna let us out of here.

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.750
You make them earn it.

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.382
I'm sorry for everything.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.740
I love you. I need you to know that.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:08.947
No!

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:12.263
No. Okay. Come on.

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:16.666
Come on.

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.785
Okay-

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:25.581
It's gonna be okay.

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.826
You're okay.

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.864
Okay, Okay-

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:47.620
What is that?

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.741
Oh, my God.

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.186
<i>The use of explosives</i>

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:54.742
<i>higher than Class 4
is prohibited on Purge Night.</i>

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.140
<i>You will be prosecuted.</i>

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.868
<i>The use of explosives higher
than Class 4 is prohibited...</i>

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.827
<i>The use of explosives higher than
Class 4 is prohibited on Purge Night.</i>

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.061
<i>You will be prosecuted.</i>

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:19.185
<i>The use of explosives higher than
Class 4 is prohibited on Purge Night.</i>

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:20.981
<i>You will be prosecuted.</i>

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.630
Do not fire!
We're here to help you!

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:23.787
Take positions
over there.

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:25.948
We need a firing line.
Let's go!

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.065
Who the fuck are you?

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.711
Nobody special.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.780
Just some people who don't necessarily
agree with the Purge is all.

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.701
You're with Carmelo Johns.

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:49.666
Yes.

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:51.424
Fuck the
New Founding Fathers!

01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:56.190
FUCK you!

01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:59.981
Fuck your money!
And motherfuck the Purge!

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.380
Carmelo!

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.101
We're over here.

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.941
I know you.

01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:11.627
You once said that

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.986
the market mentality
would no longer keep

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:14.710
the American
people stunted.

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:17.507
"We are outraged and
we're fighting back."

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:21.028
Nice to meet you,
too, young lady.

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.950
There's a lot
of them out here.

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.509
Yeah, well,
there's more of us.

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:27.581
We're more pissed off.

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.627
It's time for them to
feel what it's like.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.629
Change only comes
when their blood spills.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:39.942
You might wanna get out of here.
It's about to get nasty.

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.141
Hey.

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.101
We gotta go.

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.264
Look at me.

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:50.747
He's gone.

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.821
Come on.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:54.311
I wanna Purge.

01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.111
Look, we'll take
care of her.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:02.940
Are you sure?

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.709
Go. We got it.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:09.425
Come on.

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:12.465
I'm sorry.

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.904
Here, take it.

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:36.506
Get ready to bleed, rich bitches!
This is our time now!

01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.781
Get out of the car.

01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:04.029
Leave the keys and get out of the car.
Get out of the car!

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:08.305
Oh! Oh, God, no!

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.348
- No, don't shoot me. No. No, don't shoot me.
- Look at me!

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:13.828
Please, don't shoot me. You don't
deserve to live, you piece of shit.

01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.262
You remember me, okay?
You remember me.

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:18.501
No!

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.064
Now, run.

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.983
Run! Run!

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.065
Faster!

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.151
Look,
it's almost over.

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:35.906
No, there's
still time. I can make it.

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.190
I can make it.

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:45.146
<i>There isn't much
time left in this year's Purge.</i>

01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:49.623
<i>Get out there and make
yourself better citizens.</i>

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.223
<i>God be with you all.</i>

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.620
You want to tell us
what we're doing here?

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:01.741
Do you see that
house on the corner?

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:11.509
The owner of that house
killed my son 12 months ago.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.184
Nicholas

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:19.704
was coming home
from school,

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.942
and he swerved
off the road.

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.710
That bastard's
blood alcohol level

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.060
was three times
the legal limit,

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:33.742
but, you know, he got off
on a technicality, so...

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.269
Him and his wife and
his two little kids,

01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:37.580
well, they live
in that house,

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:40.222
happily ever after.

01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.225
Two weeks ago,
I came here

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.665
and I disabled
his back barricade.

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.027
That's what
we're doing here.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.823
I want you both to stay in this
car, do you understand me?

01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:59.109
I don't want you to move.
You'll be safe.

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.625
It's almost over.
Don't, please.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.107
Let go of my arm.

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.420
You can just
stay here with us.

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.861
And we can drive away and it'll be fine.
Let go of my arm.

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:07.381
Let go of my arm.

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.940
No, please.
I know. I'm so sorry.

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.785
I'm so sorry about what
happened to your son.

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:14.829
Let go of my arm!

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.109
Stay in this car.

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:47.789
<i>There are five minutes
remaining in this year's Purge.</i>

01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:09.270
Hey-

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.625
No! Don't talk.

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.386
Shut your mouth. I'm not
here for your kids.

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.224
- I'm here for you.
- Okay.

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:18.387
Get up.

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.303
No, no, no.

01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:25.422
Come on, come on, come on. Get up,
get up, get up.

01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:26.621
No, please don't...

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.543
Shut up, or I'll
shoot you in the face!

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:30.668
- Shut up! Get down!
- Okay! Okay, okay!

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.347
You get on your stomach.
Lay down, flat.

01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:36.831
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Okay, okay.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.271
Look at my face.
Okay.

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.190
Do you remember me? Look at my face!
Okay.

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:42.980
Do you know what you took from me?
I know.

01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.824
Do you know what you took from me?
I know.

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:49.304
You took my boy! You took my boy!
You took my fucking boy!

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.542
I am so sorry.
You took my son.

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.668
You killed my son,
you son of a bitch!

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.830
Please!
Please don't do this.

01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.664
Look at me.
Look at my face.

01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:02.591
Did you see him when you hit him?
Did you see him?

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:03.747
Tell me what
he looks like.

01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:04.821
Tell me what
he looked like!

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:06.868
Tell me what he looks like.
I'm so sorry for what I did.

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.385
Tell me you saw his face!

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:11.541
Tell me you saw his face!
I saw him.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.748
You're gonna pay for
what you did to me.

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:16.428
For what you did to my boy.
No, please.

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:17.627
Please!

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:09.830
We found your
car, Sergeant.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:13.345
Your plates told
us who you were.

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:18.068
It was easy to see where
you were headed tonight.

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:22.751
Hell, I would've
done the same thing.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:30.787
There's an unwritten
Purge rule, Sergeant.

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.589
Don't save lives.

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.028
Tonight, we take lives.

01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:41.104
We make things
manageable for us.

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:46.263
Unfortunately, the citizens
aren't killing enough.

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:52.548
So, we supplement it all
to keep things balanced.

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:57.350
It's important
work the NFFA does,

01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:59.900
and we can't have
any interference.

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:02.624
We can't have heroes.

01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:05.229
Oh, no, sir.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.864
No heroes.

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.588
I hope you feel cleansed.

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.542
Blessed be America,

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:31.108
a nation reborn.

01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.549
Oh, no. Oh, God.

01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:28.630
Oh, my God.

01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.981
Oh.

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.186
You got a car?

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:33.667
Uh... Uh, yes.
You got a fucking car?

01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.390
Go get it now!
Yes, okay. Okay!

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:36.586
Okay!

01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:38.670
Okay. Come on, Cali.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.546
Come here and
help me now, okay?

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:43.304
Look at me! Do you
want him to survive?

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:46.743
Then it's up to us. We gotta
help him now, okay? Okay?

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:48.470
On three,
we're gonna pick him up.

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:51.862
One, two, three!

01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:53.908
Come on!

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.550
Come on!

01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:59.109
Hurry up and
get that car!

01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:12.261
Okay-

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:18.667
Hospital's not far. We'll be there
in minutes.

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.869
Come on, just hit it!
Go, go, go!

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.587
You did it.

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.708
You saved us.

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:36.431
So, please, just let us
take care of you, okay?

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:12.664
It's over. It's over.

01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:19.226
<i>Just
after 7:00 a.m., March 22nd,</i>

01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:21.507
<i>and The Annual Purge
has just concluded.</i>

01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:24.151
<i>This is your American
morning news program.</i>

01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:27.064
<i>Reports are coming in
