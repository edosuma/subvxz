WEBVTT

00:06.293 --> 00:07.316
It's my boy.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.531
- Your son?
- Daniel.

00:09.556 --> 00:12.891
He takes an interest in a boat
called The Silver Darling.

00:12.916 --> 00:15.195
That boat belongs to Calum Dunwoody.

00:15.196 --> 00:16.875
I don't know who that young guy was,

00:16.876 --> 00:18.875
and my wife can vouch for my whereabouts

00:18.876 --> 00:20.675
every single night before I left.

00:20.676 --> 00:23.515
Bad business,
this body found up by the inlet?

00:23.516 --> 00:25.515
- Who are you?
- Paul Kiernan.

00:25.516 --> 00:26.675
I run this place.

00:26.676 --> 00:29.115
He was here last week,
looking for a girl.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.075
Prentice told us
not to say anything about him.

00:31.076 --> 00:33.195
You thinking Prentice Hayes has
something to do with this?

00:33.196 --> 00:36.435
That's him with Calum Dunwoody
at Up Helly Aa two years ago.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.315
We need to have a chin-wag.
Don't make me wait too long.

00:39.316 --> 00:40.595
You laughing at me?!

00:40.596 --> 00:43.515
Olivia! Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

00:43.516 --> 00:44.936
Daniel...

00:45.796 --> 00:47.636
...give them what they want, please!

00:49.156 --> 00:52.475
Just give them what they want!
They'll kill me!

00:52.476 --> 00:54.195
Please find a way!

00:54.196 --> 00:58.195
Why don't you imagine that is
your girl, and you go and find her?

01:01.996 --> 01:03.795
This isn't about drugs.

01:03.796 --> 01:06.256
It's people, Tosh,
they're selling people.

01:52.756 --> 01:55.316
Carla Hayes. Prentice, too.

01:58.316 --> 02:00.035
What about Jamie?

02:00.036 --> 02:01.276
We can't find him.

02:04.356 --> 02:05.676
Right, come on.

02:09.916 --> 02:11.195
Who called it in?

02:11.196 --> 02:12.475
Postman.

02:12.476 --> 02:15.555
Turned up at eight this morning,
saw the door had been forced.

02:15.556 --> 02:17.356
When he saw Prentice, he called us.

02:19.076 --> 02:20.716
He see anybody else around? No.

02:24.076 --> 02:25.915
No sign of a struggle.

02:25.916 --> 02:27.796
He didn't put up a fight.

02:29.876 --> 02:32.956
I think that might be
because he was sleeping.

02:35.276 --> 02:36.356
Where's Carla?

02:58.996 --> 03:00.875
We've searched the house
and the outbuildings.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.036
No sign of Jamie.

03:03.276 --> 03:05.035
Well, keep looking. He can't be far.

03:05.036 --> 03:06.235
He might be if he's running.

03:06.236 --> 03:08.256
He could be off the isles
for all we know.

03:10.996 --> 03:12.636
Jamie didnae do this.

03:14.156 --> 03:15.836
Not to his mum.

03:36.836 --> 03:38.195
You OK?

03:38.196 --> 03:39.596
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:42.196 --> 03:43.836
Are you sure? Mm.

03:49.436 --> 03:51.755
I need to ask you some questions.

03:51.756 --> 03:54.315
Can it wait?
Cos my phone is out of credit.

03:54.316 --> 03:55.876
I need to go get a top-up.

04:01.316 --> 04:02.915
Olivia...

04:02.916 --> 04:04.516
...is that your blood?

04:35.556 --> 04:37.315
Olivia.

04:37.316 --> 04:41.196
I need to know if you went back
to the Hayes' yard last night.

04:44.356 --> 04:45.676
I went to find Zezi.

04:47.489 --> 04:48.809
OK.

04:50.569 --> 04:51.769
So, what happened?

04:54.796 --> 04:56.084
- She wasn't there.
- No, I mean,

04:56.109 --> 04:57.780
what happened with the Hayes?

04:59.116 --> 05:02.356
They were... already dead when,
when I got there.

05:03.956 --> 05:07.435
I even tried to help,
but... it was no use.

05:07.436 --> 05:10.355
That's-that's how I got the blood
on my-my sleeve.

05:10.356 --> 05:12.336
Well, then why didn't you call us?

05:13.036 --> 05:14.555
I was out of credit.

05:14.556 --> 05:16.355
Well, then why didn't you
come to the station,

05:16.356 --> 05:17.635
or why didn't you come and find me?

05:17.636 --> 05:19.436
I don't know! I...

05:22.036 --> 05:23.596
I was in shock.

05:31.316 --> 05:33.196
What time did you get there?

05:34.636 --> 05:35.976
I left the...

05:36.996 --> 05:38.835
...the guest house at ten.

05:38.836 --> 05:40.315
So, erm...

05:40.316 --> 05:41.556
...around midnight.

05:42.996 --> 05:44.716
And how long did you stay?

05:45.716 --> 05:46.896
Not long.

05:49.316 --> 05:53.436
Once I realised it was... hopeless,
I, erm...

05:56.276 --> 05:57.796
...I started back.

06:00.996 --> 06:03.195
OK, I'm going to keep you in here,

06:03.196 --> 06:05.834
just until I get a little bit more
information.

06:05.835 --> 06:08.176
You think I could do something like that?

06:10.996 --> 06:12.515
My Daniel will be forgotten.

06:12.516 --> 06:13.915
Not true.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.396
Place like this.

06:17.236 --> 06:18.434
Local family killed.

06:18.435 --> 06:21.436
No-one will care about my Daniel
and Zezi.

06:21.437 --> 06:22.557
I will.

06:25.077 --> 06:26.757
I will.

06:54.077 --> 06:56.516
- That's Cora getting started.
- OK, good.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.717
Uniforms are checking the
neighbouring properties for Jamie.

07:01.837 --> 07:03.197
Did you search that?

07:04.957 --> 07:06.397
The windows are misted.

07:13.837 --> 07:15.076
Jamie?!

07:15.077 --> 07:17.196
I need some help here!

07:21.397 --> 07:23.236
What's this about the Hayes?

07:23.237 --> 07:25.156
Prentice and Carla are both dead.

07:25.157 --> 07:26.876
We're still looking for Jamie.

07:26.877 --> 07:28.696
Oh, bloody hell.

07:29.477 --> 07:31.597
We've got Olivia Lennox in custody.

07:32.917 --> 07:35.556
She went up to the Hayes' last
night looking for her daughter.

07:35.557 --> 07:37.236
She says they were dead
when she got there.

07:37.237 --> 07:38.397
You believe her?

07:39.517 --> 07:40.917
I don't know.

07:41.917 --> 07:44.136
I mean, I don't think it's beyond her.

07:44.877 --> 07:47.357
And she did have a run in with
Prentice yesterday.

07:48.397 --> 07:51.237
But then I-I can't see her
killing Daniel.

07:52.917 --> 07:56.236
Hang on, you think the Hayes
and Daniel Ugara are connected?

07:56.237 --> 07:58.156
Oh, I really hope so.

07:58.157 --> 08:00.956
Cos otherwise we've got two
homicidal maniacs

08:00.957 --> 08:02.316
running around Shetland.

08:02.317 --> 08:03.616
Boss!

08:03.917 --> 08:05.557
They found Jamie Hayes.

08:15.557 --> 08:16.876
Is he alive?

08:16.877 --> 08:18.716
Just. Lost a lot of blood.

08:18.717 --> 08:19.956
Has he said anything?

08:19.957 --> 08:22.016
Unconscious when we found him.

08:22.957 --> 08:25.916
Right, Sandy, I want you to go to
the hospital.

08:25.917 --> 08:27.596
Call me as soon as he wakes up.

08:27.597 --> 08:29.196
And get some uniforms guarding him,

08:29.197 --> 08:30.625
cos I don't want whoever did this

08:30.650 --> 08:31.876
to come back and try to finish the job.

08:31.877 --> 08:33.356
- Got it.
- Where was he?

08:33.357 --> 08:34.716
Lying in the back of that wreck.

08:34.717 --> 08:36.316
He must have been
hiding in there all night.

08:36.317 --> 08:37.836
It's a miracle he didn't freeze.

08:42.797 --> 08:45.916
Three bodies in three days, Jimmy?

08:45.917 --> 08:47.796
Yeah, I know.

08:47.797 --> 08:49.036
What can you tell us?

08:49.037 --> 08:51.036
Prentice was quick, controlled.

08:51.037 --> 08:52.556
Three stabs to the heart.

08:52.557 --> 08:54.256
Clean and precise.

08:54.837 --> 08:57.996
But Carla, on the other hand,
that was a mess.

08:57.997 --> 09:00.196
Multiple injuries.

09:00.197 --> 09:01.997
Your killer lost control.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.836
Right, so, what about time of death?

09:05.837 --> 09:08.557
I'd say they've both been
dead for 12 hours at least.

09:09.597 --> 09:12.476
Which places time of death around 9pm.

09:12.477 --> 09:14.356
OK, thanks, Cora.

09:14.357 --> 09:15.596
Tosh.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.196
I'm going to need you to confirm
with Denise at the guest house

09:18.197 --> 09:21.276
that Olivia Lennox left
there at ten o'clock last night.

09:21.277 --> 09:24.196
And then I'm going to need you to
track down Paul Kiernan,

09:24.197 --> 09:28.476
because I want to know where he took
those Macbay Hotel people yesterday.

09:28.477 --> 09:29.797
I'll see you later.

09:35.877 --> 09:39.076
I came across a few people
who'd been trafficked

09:39.077 --> 09:40.956
when I did my work at Shelter but,
to be honest,

09:40.957 --> 09:43.156
it's not really my area.

09:43.157 --> 09:45.356
What is it you wanted to know?

09:45.357 --> 09:46.876
Well, let's just start with,

09:47.296 --> 09:49.876
how likely is it to be happening
somewhere like Shetland?

09:49.877 --> 09:51.736
Ah, as likely as anywhere else.

09:52.637 --> 09:55.656
You think a trafficking gang
is working on the island?

09:56.157 --> 09:57.416
Maybe.

09:58.397 --> 09:59.996
I came across a hotel.

09:59.997 --> 10:01.396
I mean...

10:01.397 --> 10:03.148
...it's a dump in the middle of nowhere.

10:03.149 --> 10:05.796
- Mm-hmm.
- Shut down in 2005,

10:05.797 --> 10:09.116
and then it opened up about
six months ago.

10:09.117 --> 10:13.076
And, up until yesterday,
there were a bunch of people there.

10:13.077 --> 10:16.356
And then suddenly over night,
they just disappeared.

10:16.357 --> 10:18.476
- Well, did you speak to any of them?
- Yeah, barmaid.

10:18.477 --> 10:22.436
But, you know, she just... looked
like any other seasonal worker.

10:22.437 --> 10:24.576
It can be hard to tell the difference.

10:25.357 --> 10:28.736
Anyway, she'd know better than to
give anything away to the police.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.370
I mean, you talk to the cops,
you end up dead.

10:33.237 --> 10:34.597
What?

10:37.837 --> 10:39.276
I just find it hard to believe.

10:39.277 --> 10:41.197
- People trafficking?
- No.

10:43.157 --> 10:45.076
That it's here.

10:45.077 --> 10:47.556
On Shetland. Oh, come on, Jimmy.

10:47.557 --> 10:49.656
Take a look around you.

10:50.077 --> 10:52.556
Well, then why aren't
we all talking about that?

10:52.557 --> 10:54.317
Because we don't want to.

10:56.717 --> 10:59.036
As long as our toilets are clean,
our cars are washed,

10:59.037 --> 11:01.236
our food comes on time.

11:01.237 --> 11:03.396
And as long as it's all kept far
enough away,

11:03.397 --> 11:04.717
we're happy to ignore it.

11:07.197 --> 11:10.116
I mean, God forbid anything
as trivial as the exploitation

11:10.117 --> 11:12.517
of vulnerable people should
affect our lives.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.037
What's so funny?

11:20.637 --> 11:22.956
Nothing, I just forgot
that you get like this.

11:22.957 --> 11:24.476
Like what?

11:24.477 --> 11:26.477
Ardent.

11:27.597 --> 11:30.477
- Sorry.
- No, no, don't be, I missed it.

11:34.837 --> 11:37.336
Give them what they want, please!

11:37.837 --> 11:39.716
Just give them what they want!

11:39.717 --> 11:41.156
They'll kill me!

11:41.157 --> 11:42.797
Please find a way!

11:47.477 --> 11:48.516
What have you got?

11:48.517 --> 11:52.196
Denise confirmed Olivia Lennox left
the guest house at ten last night.

11:52.197 --> 11:54.316
- And what about the room?
- Search team have been over it

11:54.317 --> 11:55.836
but they haven't found anything.

11:55.837 --> 11:57.036
Got a taxi driver,

11:57.037 --> 12:00.236
says he drove by the Hayes'
yard about nine last night.

12:00.237 --> 12:01.516
Saw a van on the road.

12:01.517 --> 12:05.037
- Did he tell you what sort of van?
- No, but he's checking his dash-cam.

12:07.757 --> 12:10.836
- What about Paul Kiernan?
- He doesn't exist.

12:10.837 --> 12:12.916
Looks like he must have been
using a false identity.

12:12.917 --> 12:15.996
The Macbay Hotel, get forensics up there.

12:15.997 --> 12:18.916
- Maybe they can find his prints.
- Forensics are still at the Hayes'.

12:18.917 --> 12:22.157
Well, then, split the teams, because
we have to find out who he is.

12:28.877 --> 12:31.216
So, the news is out about the Hayes.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.196
People are scared there's someone
going around butchering families.

12:35.197 --> 12:38.116
Still, at least we can tell them
we've got someone in custody.

12:38.117 --> 12:41.996
Oh, no, we don't have
anything on Olivia Lennox.

12:41.997 --> 12:45.016
- We can put her at the scene.
- No, that's ALL we can do.

12:45.477 --> 12:47.356
We don't have any physical evidence.

12:47.357 --> 12:49.016
We don't have a weapon.

12:49.637 --> 12:52.256
And she couldn't have been
there at the time of death.

12:52.757 --> 12:56.836
Plus... I think there's something
much bigger behind this.

12:56.837 --> 12:58.436
Something organised.

12:58.437 --> 12:59.796
Like what?

12:59.797 --> 13:01.176
People traffickers.

13:01.797 --> 13:04.036
- Are you sure about this?
- No.

13:04.037 --> 13:07.677
But it makes more sense than
Olivia Lennox killing three people.

13:48.557 --> 13:49.896
Come on.

13:50.637 --> 13:52.576
I'll drive you back to your B&B.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.517
This way.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.116
Why don't you go in and get some sleep

14:08.117 --> 14:09.696
and I'll come and see you later?

14:11.517 --> 14:14.770
- I'm going to find Zezi.
- No, I can't let you do that.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.011
Why not?

14:16.036 --> 14:18.416
Because I don't want you
ending up like Daniel.

14:18.917 --> 14:21.236
Zezi's already lost her brother.

14:21.237 --> 14:23.037
You're all she's got left.

14:29.037 --> 14:31.117
You're going to have to trust me, Olivia.

14:33.597 --> 14:35.677
Let me do my job.

15:04.117 --> 15:05.276
Billy?

15:05.277 --> 15:07.836
Taxi driver came back to me about
the van he saw up at the Hayes'.

15:07.837 --> 15:10.116
We got a registration?

15:10.117 --> 15:11.396
Aye.

15:11.397 --> 15:12.756
It's a company vehicle.

15:12.757 --> 15:13.837
Which company?

15:19.997 --> 15:21.716
Aye, heard about that this morning.

15:21.717 --> 15:23.596
Such a terrible thing to happen.

15:23.597 --> 15:25.796
I had a lot of time for Carla.

15:25.797 --> 15:28.876
I've got a witness who saw one of
your vans

15:28.877 --> 15:31.116
up near her yard last night.

15:31.117 --> 15:32.417
That right?

15:32.442 --> 15:34.175
Aye, so I'm going to
need to speak to whoever

15:34.176 --> 15:35.556
was driving the van.

15:35.557 --> 15:38.236
Ah, the thing is, uh...
I was talking to my lawyer,

15:38.237 --> 15:41.197
and unless I'm under arrest, I'm
under no obligation to cooperate.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.816
Hey, where are you going?

15:46.677 --> 15:48.036
Hey!

15:48.037 --> 15:50.716
I'm going to go and find
your inspectors and give them

15:50.717 --> 15:53.516
a wee heads up about your other pipeline.

15:53.517 --> 15:54.557
All right!

15:55.597 --> 15:57.077
I was driving the van.

15:58.213 --> 15:59.227
You?

15:59.252 --> 16:01.676
Aye, I pass the Hayes'
place on my way home.

16:01.677 --> 16:03.676
And what time was that?

16:03.677 --> 16:05.156
Och, I'm no' sure.

16:05.157 --> 16:07.276
I left here... at...

16:07.277 --> 16:08.677
...about half eight.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.117
Thanks... for your cooperation.

16:15.157 --> 16:16.237
Perez.

16:17.997 --> 16:20.077
Perez, wait. Just, just hold on.

16:21.517 --> 16:23.876
I don't want any... friction here.

16:23.877 --> 16:25.656
I'm just trying to run a business.

16:26.317 --> 16:28.956
If you do have other information,
then you better tell me

16:28.957 --> 16:30.997
- or there will be friction.
- All right.

16:33.957 --> 16:36.836
Look, I-I did see something
up at Voxter Roe last night.

16:36.837 --> 16:38.437
- You know it?
- I know it.

16:39.917 --> 16:43.197
Silver Darling was up there.
Calum Dunwoody's boat.

16:44.157 --> 16:45.836
There's no harbour at Voxter Roe.

16:45.837 --> 16:48.117
Exactly. So, what was he doing?

16:50.077 --> 16:51.397
We're not done yet.

17:59.277 --> 18:01.456
What the hell are you doing calling me?

18:03.277 --> 18:06.917
I don't give a shit! I told you not
to contact me on this number!

18:10.517 --> 18:12.036
Nah!

18:12.037 --> 18:14.736
No, no, no, that's-that's no' my problem.

18:15.517 --> 18:17.676
Look, I did my job.

18:17.677 --> 18:19.757
You sort it out yourself.

18:21.717 --> 18:23.956
I don't care what you do...

18:23.957 --> 18:26.477
...long as you keep me out of it,
all right?!

18:30.397 --> 18:31.637
Stop calling me on...

18:33.197 --> 18:34.676
Oh, hi, pet!

18:34.677 --> 18:37.296
No, no, I just... I thought it was
somebody else.

18:39.157 --> 18:40.856
Aye, aye, I'm on my way.

18:42.597 --> 18:43.717
Aye!

18:45.103 --> 18:46.463
I love you too.

18:47.477 --> 18:49.037
Right.

21:04.957 --> 21:06.771
Don't just stand there, eh?

21:06.796 --> 21:08.181
Give us a hand.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.676
She'll need to sleep.

21:15.677 --> 21:17.996
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

21:17.997 --> 21:19.797
- She's fine.
- Are you sure?

21:28.477 --> 21:30.496
Are we going to have a problem?

21:31.117 --> 21:32.476
Hmm?

21:34.797 --> 21:36.856
Are we going to have a problem?

21:37.397 --> 21:38.637
No.

21:52.037 --> 21:53.456
Good.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.996
I thought you were dead!

22:11.997 --> 22:13.597
Do you know where we are?

22:17.717 --> 22:19.117
It's OK.

22:29.157 --> 22:31.356
I can't be sure,

22:31.357 --> 22:33.356
but I reckon the hold of
the Silver Darling was

22:33.357 --> 22:35.157
full of people last night.

22:36.717 --> 22:40.116
And could be, this is how
Kiernan does it.

22:40.117 --> 22:42.836
He smuggles people onto the isles,

22:42.837 --> 22:46.236
and then holds them here until he can...

22:46.237 --> 22:47.676
...move them on to the mainland.

22:47.677 --> 22:50.156
- And Calum Dunwoody's involved?
- Makes sense.

22:50.157 --> 22:52.116
If you're looking to move people
around the North Sea,

22:52.117 --> 22:53.976
then a trawler's the perfect cover.

22:54.477 --> 22:56.376
So do you know where Calum took them?

22:56.597 --> 22:58.156
Not yet.

22:58.157 --> 22:59.877
But we're working on it.

23:05.757 --> 23:07.076
Who is it?

23:07.077 --> 23:09.277
It's DI Perez, Shetland Police.

23:17.557 --> 23:19.236
I'm looking for Calum.

23:19.237 --> 23:21.196
He's not here, he's out at sea.

23:21.197 --> 23:22.496
Is he?

23:25.517 --> 23:27.496
His boat's in the harbour.

23:31.117 --> 23:32.896
Mind if I come in?

23:51.197 --> 23:52.557
Do you know where Calum is?

23:53.957 --> 23:55.317
Er, no. Sorry.

23:56.637 --> 23:58.776
Did he not come home last night?

24:05.037 --> 24:06.636
It's Morag, isn't it?

24:06.637 --> 24:07.896
Aye.

24:11.476 --> 24:12.956
Is he causing you trouble?

24:14.477 --> 24:15.716
What?

24:17.157 --> 24:18.477
Your peerie boy.

24:19.437 --> 24:21.157
He's, uh...

24:22.157 --> 24:23.837
...he's not one for sleeping.

24:28.477 --> 24:31.516
- Well, I better leave you to it, then.
- Right, sure.

24:31.517 --> 24:34.517
See when you see Calum, you tell him
I need to talk to him, OK?

25:39.277 --> 25:40.597
Thank you.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.156
- Tosh!
- Oh, hey, Donnie! How's it going?

25:47.157 --> 25:49.237
Good! You getting some coffee?

25:51.197 --> 25:54.516
Ah! Stupid question, right enough!

25:54.517 --> 25:55.916
How's work?

25:55.917 --> 25:57.596
Oh, dull. Yours?

25:57.597 --> 25:59.117
Definitely not dull.

26:01.437 --> 26:03.436
Look, I should probably... get going.

26:03.437 --> 26:06.117
Oh, of course! Sorry, I... See you later.

26:07.437 --> 26:09.416
Do you want to go out one night?

26:10.717 --> 26:13.036
Oh, uh...

26:13.037 --> 26:15.576
Probably came out a wee bit
louder than I meant it to.

26:16.397 --> 26:17.936
Why don't you give me a call?

26:18.557 --> 26:19.957
I'll do that.

26:23.077 --> 26:25.876
Oh, wait, I don't have your number!

26:27.717 --> 26:30.197
- Prentice's call records came in.
- Ah...

26:33.837 --> 26:35.376
Everything OK?

26:35.957 --> 26:40.156
How many calls do you think Prentice
Hayes made in the last seven days?

26:40.157 --> 26:42.116
I don't know. A lot?

26:42.117 --> 26:44.556
Three, according to this.

26:44.557 --> 26:46.037
All of them to his mum.

26:47.077 --> 26:48.736
Guess how many he received?

26:49.437 --> 26:50.636
Five.

26:50.637 --> 26:53.556
Two from his mum and three
from some dodgy cold caller.

26:53.557 --> 26:55.676
- That seems a bit low.
- A bit low?!

26:55.677 --> 26:57.836
This is Prentice Hayes
we're talking about,

26:57.837 --> 26:59.956
all the dodgy schemes he was running!

26:59.957 --> 27:01.636
You telling me he could manage
all of them

27:01.637 --> 27:02.876
by making three calls a week?

27:02.877 --> 27:06.036
- So there's another phone?
- I'd be willing to bet on it.

27:06.037 --> 27:07.877
I'll call the search team.

27:35.197 --> 27:38.676
Calum? Calum, I need to talk to you!

27:38.677 --> 27:40.636
I've got nothing to say to you.

27:40.637 --> 27:42.036
- Calum...
- Get in the house, Morag!

27:42.061 --> 27:43.756
Don't make me arrest you.

27:43.757 --> 27:45.957
Calum!

27:49.477 --> 27:51.357
Well, that was just stupid.

27:57.077 --> 27:59.456
If you're going to charge me, charge me.

28:00.117 --> 28:01.716
I need to get out of here.

28:01.717 --> 28:03.996
Why don't you sit down, Calum?

28:03.997 --> 28:05.036
I want to go.

28:05.037 --> 28:07.596
OK, you can go, after we've talked.

28:07.597 --> 28:08.996
About what?

28:08.997 --> 28:13.437
About the people you took on your
boat at Voxter Roe two nights ago.

28:14.557 --> 28:17.136
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Your boat.

28:18.117 --> 28:20.037
It was seen anchored there.

28:21.037 --> 28:25.357
Did you take the people from the
Macbay Hotel on board that night?

28:28.877 --> 28:31.576
I was on your boat, Calum.

28:33.037 --> 28:35.556
And I saw the fish hold that
you kept them in.

28:35.557 --> 28:37.437
Where did you sail to, Calum?

28:39.517 --> 28:42.776
OK, you don't want to talk,
that's fine. Get Morag in here.

28:43.237 --> 28:45.576
- You can't do that.
- Oh, really? Says who?

28:46.837 --> 28:48.676
She doesn't know anything.

28:48.677 --> 28:50.916
Well, you see, in my experience,
the people that we love

28:50.917 --> 28:53.077
tend to know a lot more than they let on.

29:02.117 --> 29:04.356
I landed them off Scrabster.

29:04.357 --> 29:05.916
Why take them there?

29:05.917 --> 29:08.196
- Because that's what I was told to do.
- By who?

29:08.197 --> 29:09.756
Was it Paul Kiernan?

29:09.757 --> 29:10.976
Look, you...

29:11.717 --> 29:12.996
You just do what you're told.

29:12.997 --> 29:15.677
You don't ask these guys any questions.

29:20.637 --> 29:21.936
This girl.

29:22.317 --> 29:23.717
Zezi Ugara.

29:24.837 --> 29:26.037
Was she on your boat?

29:27.317 --> 29:28.997
Did you see her?

29:31.717 --> 29:34.476
Another Asian woman, young.

29:34.477 --> 29:36.856
Tattoo of a butterfly on her wrist.

29:37.917 --> 29:40.077
I make sure I don't see anyone.

29:45.557 --> 29:47.736
Did you hear about what
happened to the Hayes?

29:49.477 --> 29:51.076
Aye, I heard.

29:51.077 --> 29:54.596
Right, so, do you think that the
people you're dealing with

29:54.597 --> 29:56.216
had anything to do with that?

29:58.237 --> 29:59.397
Come on, Calum.

30:01.397 --> 30:02.736
Help us out here.

30:03.317 --> 30:04.696
These people...

30:05.837 --> 30:07.456
You know what they do?

30:08.077 --> 30:10.637
Kidnap, torture, trafficking.

30:12.717 --> 30:15.077
You could help us put a stop to that.

30:18.637 --> 30:20.357
A stop to it?

30:22.157 --> 30:26.197
Have you got any idea who you're
dealing with here?

30:27.717 --> 30:30.796
These people could have me killed in
a heartbeat.

30:30.797 --> 30:33.416
- Yeah, we can protect you from that...
- No.

30:34.197 --> 30:36.376
No, you can't. See...

30:37.437 --> 30:39.896
...this thing is huge.

30:41.437 --> 30:43.477
These people are everywhere.

30:44.637 --> 30:46.277
You?

30:47.357 --> 30:50.677
You're just some guy standing
on a rock in the middle of the sea.

30:58.917 --> 31:01.596
We contacted the police at Scrabster.

31:01.597 --> 31:05.336
They've said they're going to try
and find out where Kiernan's hiding.

31:06.397 --> 31:07.716
And what about Calum?

31:07.717 --> 31:09.996
Well, I think we should keep him in.

31:09.997 --> 31:12.516
He might feel
more like talking in the morning.

31:12.517 --> 31:13.756
Has he asked for a solicitor?

31:13.757 --> 31:15.556
We offered but he declined.

31:15.557 --> 31:18.156
We think Calum doesn't want the
traffickers

31:18.157 --> 31:20.016
to find out that he's here.

31:20.277 --> 31:21.636
Jesus, he's that frightened?

31:21.637 --> 31:22.757
Aye, his wife, too.

31:23.997 --> 31:26.436
Well, if she's at risk,
shouldn't we have bodies up there?

31:26.437 --> 31:29.356
We've already got people at the
hospital watching over Jamie...

31:29.357 --> 31:32.677
Aye, well, maybe you should go up
there tonight and see if she's OK.

31:33.957 --> 31:37.636
In the meantime, we need to find out
who Paul Kiernan is.

31:37.637 --> 31:38.996
Forensics have processed the hotel.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.516
We'll find out tomorrow if they've
got anything that can identify him.

31:41.517 --> 31:46.036
OK, good. Also, I need you to get in
touch with DS Sam Boyd.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.356
She runs the trafficking unit in Glasgow.

31:48.357 --> 31:51.736
See if she knows about any smuggling
units working up here.

31:52.237 --> 31:53.397
Jimmy, can I have a word?

31:59.757 --> 32:02.756
You seem to have settled on Kiernan
pretty quickly, don't you think?

32:02.757 --> 32:04.156
Well...

32:04.157 --> 32:07.076
...Paul Kiernan's a person of
interest in the Daniel Ugara murder.

32:07.077 --> 32:09.676
It's also likely he's holding Zezi Ugara.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.356
And what about the Hayes?

32:11.357 --> 32:14.476
We don't have any evidence
linking them to people trafficking.

32:14.477 --> 32:16.276
Well, maybe we just haven't found it yet.

32:16.277 --> 32:18.716
Or maybe they were
killed for another reason.

32:18.717 --> 32:19.916
Prentice wasn't short of enemies.

32:19.917 --> 32:21.836
He was dealing with all
sorts of low life.

32:21.837 --> 32:23.916
Including Paul Kiernan.

32:23.917 --> 32:26.616
Sir? Jamie Hayes is ready to talk.

32:40.357 --> 32:41.477
How you doing, Jamie?

32:42.517 --> 32:43.597
Where's Mum?

32:45.717 --> 32:47.176
They won't tell me anything.

32:49.797 --> 32:52.856
Jamie, I'm sorry, but your mum
didn't make it.

32:53.397 --> 32:54.957
And neither did Prentice.

32:56.050 --> 32:57.210
Nah.

32:59.077 --> 33:00.656
I'm really sorry.

33:08.157 --> 33:10.456
I know this is hard, son.

33:11.037 --> 33:14.336
But I'm going to have to ask you to
tell me what happened.

33:28.837 --> 33:29.997
You all right?

33:31.477 --> 33:33.136
When can I get out of here?

33:33.797 --> 33:35.837
Well, that all depends on you.

33:37.437 --> 33:40.416
Look, I'm heading up to your place now.

33:40.837 --> 33:43.277
Make sure Morag and the bairns are OK.

33:45.196 --> 33:46.996
Can you give her a message?

33:48.197 --> 33:50.276
Doesn't really work like that, Calum.

33:50.277 --> 33:51.936
Well, tell her to go.

33:52.357 --> 33:55.376
Tell her to take the kids
and get off the island.

33:56.277 --> 33:58.077
Go to her mother's. Anywhere.

33:59.797 --> 34:01.357
Just get off Shetland.

34:02.437 --> 34:04.216
I'll pass on your message...

34:04.997 --> 34:06.957
...if you tell me who you were
working for.

34:14.197 --> 34:16.036
Calum.

34:16.036 --> 34:17.917
You need to think about saving yourself.

34:20.237 --> 34:21.397
And your family.

34:37.036 --> 34:38.717
There you go, son.

34:40.357 --> 34:42.117
We'd been in Lerwick.

34:43.197 --> 34:44.775
Mum and me.

34:45.597 --> 34:48.295
Er... We came back home.

34:49.277 --> 34:51.976
Mum went into the house
while I parked the car.

34:54.117 --> 34:55.516
And I heard her scream.

34:57.677 --> 34:59.436
I ran in, er...

34:59.437 --> 35:01.957
...saw the front door had been kicked in.

35:03.177 --> 35:05.497
I saw... Prentice on the couch.

35:06.783 --> 35:08.183
And his eyes were...

35:11.437 --> 35:14.276
Er, then I heard my mum shouting again,

35:14.277 --> 35:15.896
er, from the kitchen.

35:16.357 --> 35:18.196
I went through.

35:18.197 --> 35:21.236
Er... Er, she was on the floor.

35:21.237 --> 35:24.016
Her hand up in front of her face.

35:26.877 --> 35:28.757
She had this look, like...

35:30.617 --> 35:31.857
...wild.

35:35.157 --> 35:36.936
And then I just...

35:37.623 --> 35:39.782
...felt this pain in my back.

35:40.010 --> 35:41.410
I turned round and...

35:42.757 --> 35:44.236
...they were behind me.

35:44.237 --> 35:46.016
Who was behind you?

35:46.397 --> 35:48.276
They had a mask on. Er...

35:48.277 --> 35:49.597
A ski-mask thing.

35:51.957 --> 35:55.556
I felt them... stabbing at me
with a knife.

35:56.456 --> 35:58.797
I felt it going in and...

36:00.597 --> 36:02.976
...I, er, thought, I was a dead man.

36:06.997 --> 36:08.597
And then...

36:09.917 --> 36:14.256
...and then my mum comes
flying past me, screaming.

36:14.917 --> 36:16.396
She knocks me over.

36:16.397 --> 36:17.797
I fall.

36:20.397 --> 36:21.796
But I...

36:21.797 --> 36:24.136
...I-I must've got back up again.

36:25.037 --> 36:26.997
I-I must've ran out the door.

36:28.117 --> 36:30.176
Did this attacker say anything?

36:31.197 --> 36:32.616
Never said a word.

36:33.237 --> 36:35.716
What about build? Was it a man?

36:35.717 --> 36:38.696
A woman? Big? Small? Did they seem young?

36:39.317 --> 36:41.396
I think it was a man.

36:41.397 --> 36:42.677
Well-built.

36:44.957 --> 36:46.037
She saved me.

36:47.397 --> 36:48.437
Mum.

36:49.597 --> 36:50.837
In the kitchen.

36:53.517 --> 36:54.936
I shou...

36:55.477 --> 36:57.576
I should've helped her.

36:58.997 --> 37:00.757
Instead, I just ran.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.856
When did she leave? About an hour ago.

37:15.517 --> 37:17.476
Did she say where she was going?

37:17.477 --> 37:18.517
For a walk.

37:21.517 --> 37:22.837
I needed some air.

37:24.117 --> 37:25.376
Thanks.

37:36.037 --> 37:37.877
So, I have updates.

37:39.637 --> 37:42.276
We found Jamie Hayes, alive.

37:42.277 --> 37:43.717
What's he saying?

37:45.837 --> 37:49.416
That he was there when his mother
and brother were killed.

37:49.797 --> 37:51.516
That he was attacked also,

37:52.456 --> 37:54.536
but that he managed to get away.

37:55.517 --> 37:56.916
So, who was it?

37:56.917 --> 37:58.237
We don't know.

37:59.557 --> 38:00.957
And what about Zezi?

38:04.957 --> 38:06.477
Olivia...

38:09.077 --> 38:14.056
...we think that Zezi is being
held by people traffickers.

38:15.397 --> 38:19.036
We don't know who they are, but we
think they're working on Shetland.

38:19.037 --> 38:20.077
Oh, God.

38:21.277 --> 38:26.156
It could be... that Daniel was here...

38:26.157 --> 38:27.997
...looking for his sister.

38:32.357 --> 38:34.596
Now, I know it's a lot to ask,

38:34.597 --> 38:37.797
but I'm going to need you to
sit on your hands for a while. Oh!

38:41.317 --> 38:42.357
OK?

38:44.957 --> 38:46.157
OK.

39:05.597 --> 39:07.676
- You off somewhere nice?
- Aye.

39:07.677 --> 39:09.336
Me and Mary are having dinner.

39:09.797 --> 39:11.396
That a reconciliation?

39:11.397 --> 39:12.996
More of a negotiation.

39:12.997 --> 39:15.836
I want my half of the money
from the house.

39:15.837 --> 39:17.776
- Alice dropped by to see you.
- Right.

39:20.437 --> 39:21.877
You two have fun.

39:26.477 --> 39:28.416
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:30.117 --> 39:33.036
So, I rang the Shelter people
I used to work for.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.716
Got them to send me through some
recent stats and reports.

39:35.717 --> 39:38.836
- I thought they might be useful.
- Oh, thanks. I appreciate that.

39:38.837 --> 39:41.557
Word of warning, it's not exactly
cheery reading.

39:44.637 --> 39:46.576
What are your plans for tonight?

39:47.317 --> 39:48.436
Nothing, really.

39:48.437 --> 39:50.876
Chris has gone over to see
the house again.

39:50.877 --> 39:52.597
Look, I could make us some dinner.

39:54.117 --> 39:56.256
I'm never one to turn down a free meal.

39:57.197 --> 39:58.317
OK.

40:22.077 --> 40:23.317
Plenty of sugar in it.

41:34.117 --> 41:36.516
- Tosh?
- Hey, Billy. Do me a favour,

41:36.517 --> 41:39.236
check if the Hayes have any
other properties, will you?

41:39.237 --> 41:40.717
- Will do.
- Thanks.

42:17.557 --> 42:20.237
Niki? Niki!

42:24.677 --> 42:25.956
We need help!

42:25.957 --> 42:28.036
We need help in here, please!

42:28.037 --> 42:29.676
Please, we need help!

42:32.677 --> 42:34.356
What did I tell you?

42:34.357 --> 42:35.736
She has a fever!

42:37.157 --> 42:38.397
Oh, shit.

42:43.237 --> 42:44.556
Come here!

42:44.557 --> 42:46.156
No! Wait!

42:46.157 --> 42:48.436
Where are you taking her?!

42:48.437 --> 42:50.156
No!

42:54.397 --> 42:57.357
Please! Please don't hurt her!

43:10.757 --> 43:15.356
I can't believe that I was in the
place where they were being held.

43:15.357 --> 43:17.157
And there's another girl.

43:18.877 --> 43:20.496
Her name is Zezi.

43:21.397 --> 43:25.676
And she was in this
video that we were sent,

43:25.677 --> 43:28.496
and she's pleading for...

43:29.237 --> 43:31.197
...well, she's pleading for her life.

43:32.837 --> 43:35.296
And she's got this look in her eyes,

43:35.757 --> 43:37.556
and it isn't just fear.

43:37.557 --> 43:39.556
There's something else there.

43:39.557 --> 43:42.196
And so I watched it again and
again and again

43:42.197 --> 43:45.557
and again, and I just
I couldn't put my finger on it.

43:46.997 --> 43:50.376
Until I realised that it's...

43:51.317 --> 43:52.717
...bewilderment.

43:56.277 --> 44:01.037
This girl is utterly bewildered.

44:03.437 --> 44:06.477
She has no idea why this is
happening to her.

44:11.237 --> 44:14.196
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to bore you with work.

44:14.197 --> 44:15.237
It's not boring.

44:16.717 --> 44:20.316
It's good to be reminded there are
people with worse problems than me.

44:20.317 --> 44:21.557
Is everything OK?

44:22.637 --> 44:24.037
Everything's fine.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.536
Talk about it if you like.

44:28.997 --> 44:30.356
Well, don't take this the wrong way,

44:30.357 --> 44:33.196
but you're in no position to sort
anybody's head out, Jimmy Perez.

44:33.197 --> 44:37.036
Oh, I'll have you know I'm a very
stable and well-rounded individual.

44:37.037 --> 44:40.037
Who has decided to spend the rest
of his days mourning his dead wife.

44:49.757 --> 44:51.756
I might've had a little
bit too much wine.

44:51.757 --> 44:52.917
Yeah, you think?

44:54.037 --> 44:57.176
Aren't you getting a bit tired
of playing the grieving husband?

44:58.077 --> 44:59.916
Been a long time, Jimmy.

44:59.917 --> 45:01.397
Oh, yeah, I know that.

45:02.357 --> 45:07.296
Well, don't you think it's time to
let Fran go and start living again?

45:08.317 --> 45:10.636
I'm not trying to piss you off.

45:10.637 --> 45:12.556
I'm your friend. I care about you.

45:12.557 --> 45:13.954
Really, honestly, Alice,

45:13.979 --> 45:15.676
- I'd rather not.
- You loved her!

45:15.677 --> 45:17.117
We all loved her!

45:18.277 --> 45:20.836
And I understand why you want to
hold on to her memory.

45:20.837 --> 45:23.476
And, if I'm honest, the grieving
widower thing?

45:23.477 --> 45:25.037
Looks good on you.

45:27.637 --> 45:29.376
But Fran would've hated it.

45:30.397 --> 45:32.916
She'd be mortified if she knew that
you were wasting your life

45:32.917 --> 45:34.477
because of her.

45:52.677 --> 45:53.876
I'm going to have to go.

45:53.877 --> 45:55.716
Jimmy, I really didn't mean it...

45:55.717 --> 45:58.116
You can see yourself out, OK?

46:17.197 --> 46:18.536
What's this about?

46:19.157 --> 46:20.916
It's what it says.

46:20.917 --> 46:23.476
I'm going to pay the ransom
in exchange for Zezi.

46:23.477 --> 46:24.896
OK.

46:25.277 --> 46:29.476
For a start, you and I both know
you don't have that kind of money.

46:29.477 --> 46:30.716
No, I'll get it.

46:30.717 --> 46:32.116
Somehow.

46:32.117 --> 46:34.236
Just contact them and tell them I'll pay.

46:34.237 --> 46:38.116
Olivia, don't you think that if
I had any way of getting in touch

46:38.117 --> 46:41.316
with these people,
that I would've done it by now?

46:41.317 --> 46:42.996
They talked to Daniel.

46:42.997 --> 46:45.876
Yeah, through encrypted messaging
services. Oh, OK.

46:45.877 --> 46:47.776
We can't trace them.

46:49.157 --> 46:52.476
Even if we could, even if you pay,

46:52.477 --> 46:54.156
they still won't let Zezi go.

46:54.157 --> 46:57.076
In fact, if you pay that
gives them all the more reason to

46:57.077 --> 46:58.776
hold on to her.

46:59.517 --> 47:00.556
What else can I do?

47:00.557 --> 47:01.996
You can let us handle this.

47:01.997 --> 47:04.317
But you are not handling this.

47:07.437 --> 47:09.176
Look, it's like you said.

47:09.917 --> 47:11.197
Daniel is dead.

47:12.557 --> 47:15.156
Zezi is all I've got left.

47:15.157 --> 47:17.237
I'm going to do everything
I can to help her.

47:19.877 --> 47:20.917
You're a dad.

47:22.117 --> 47:23.597
You've got a daughter.

47:25.197 --> 47:27.517
You know I have to do something.

47:29.077 --> 47:30.117
You know.

49:19.456 --> 49:21.056
What happened to you last night?

49:22.677 --> 49:24.757
Me and Mary had another argument.

49:26.117 --> 49:29.556
So I went to the pub to lick my wounds.

49:29.557 --> 49:31.156
All right for some.

49:31.157 --> 49:32.356
I thought you'd be happy.

49:32.357 --> 49:35.176
A chance to get more time alone
with Alice.

49:35.517 --> 49:37.836
Alice and I are just friends.

49:37.837 --> 49:39.356
Right.

49:39.357 --> 49:40.877
Does she know that?

49:42.317 --> 49:43.796
Oh, come on.

49:43.797 --> 49:46.316
She totally fancies you.

49:46.317 --> 49:47.996
What age are you?

49:47.997 --> 49:51.957
Old enough to know when a woman's
got the hots for my housemate.

49:54.997 --> 49:57.496
We are not housemates.

50:07.917 --> 50:11.816
Looks like we've found another part
of Prentice Hayes' business empire.

50:17.957 --> 50:20.036
You can't say he wasn't industrious.

50:20.037 --> 50:22.117
How did you find it? Luck.

50:23.077 --> 50:25.476
Anybody else here when you turned up? No.

50:25.477 --> 50:27.037
But come and see this.

50:32.877 --> 50:36.536
Been more than one person up here,
and probably working for Prentice.

50:37.157 --> 50:40.357
What makes you so sure it's
Prentice? That wall behind you.

50:43.757 --> 50:46.396
Prentice Hayes. Leave a message.

50:49.397 --> 50:51.237
Told you he had a second phone.

51:05.877 --> 51:08.136
Did you speak to Morag?

51:09.929 --> 51:11.129
She's fine.

51:12.717 --> 51:14.116
But she's worried.

51:14.117 --> 51:15.757
And did you give her the message?

51:18.157 --> 51:19.757
I'm going to need the names.

51:26.783 --> 51:27.823
Calum...

51:31.263 --> 51:33.383
...you can't help Morag from a cell.

51:38.717 --> 51:40.157
Get me paper and a pen.

51:43.837 --> 51:45.357
You want the names or not?

51:54.997 --> 51:56.157
So start writing.

51:58.997 --> 52:00.576
Give me 20 minutes.

52:02.637 --> 52:03.677
OK.

52:18.517 --> 52:20.837
- Tosh, can you give me a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

52:22.197 --> 52:25.316
Jimmy, I'm sorry about last night.

52:25.317 --> 52:26.716
I didn't mean to get so...

52:26.717 --> 52:27.757
Brutal?

52:29.210 --> 52:31.090
I was going to say ardent.

52:37.917 --> 52:41.676
I'm not mad at you for what you said.

52:41.677 --> 52:43.036
And I don't think you were wrong.

52:43.037 --> 52:44.516
Good.

52:44.517 --> 52:45.877
Because I wasn't.

52:49.997 --> 52:51.837
I'm glad you cared enough to say it.

52:54.357 --> 52:55.597
You're a good friend.

52:57.637 --> 53:00.736
And good friends are allowed to
analyse the shit out of each other.

53:04.477 --> 53:05.996
See you soon?

53:06.250 --> 53:07.410
Definitely.

53:16.317 --> 53:17.357
Hey, Billy.

53:19.037 --> 53:22.556
Sir? The prints the forensic team
found at the Macbay Hotel,

53:22.557 --> 53:25.076
they went through the database
and up popped this guy.

53:25.077 --> 53:27.156
- Recognise him?
- Paul Kiernan.

53:27.157 --> 53:30.036
Real name, Aaron McGuire.
Originally from Glasgow.

53:30.037 --> 53:32.516
Got some convictions for fraud
and an assault charge.

53:32.517 --> 53:33.716
Any history of trafficking?

53:33.717 --> 53:34.756
None that I can see.

53:34.757 --> 53:36.356
OK. Good work.

53:36.357 --> 53:38.196
What's, er, what's this about
a drug farm?

53:38.197 --> 53:39.316
Tosh found it last night.

53:39.317 --> 53:41.037
Looks like Prentice was running it.

53:42.477 --> 53:43.956
Tosh, phone Sam Boyd.

53:43.957 --> 53:45.780
See if you can set up a meeting tomorrow.

53:45.805 --> 53:46.851
We're going to Glasgow?

53:46.852 --> 53:48.036
On the next flight if we can.

53:48.037 --> 53:49.996
Hang on, why are you going to Glasgow?

53:49.997 --> 53:52.356
Paul Kiernan is our main suspect.

53:52.357 --> 53:54.716
We just found out that his real name
is Aaron McGuire,

53:54.717 --> 53:56.356
and he's based in Glasgow.

53:56.357 --> 53:59.436
So we go to Glasgow, we find
McGuire, and we bring back the man

53:59.437 --> 54:02.036
responsible for the murder of
Daniel and the Hayes.

54:02.037 --> 54:03.436
And what about the drug farm?

54:03.437 --> 54:05.836
I don't think that's a big enough
operation to get you

54:05.837 --> 54:07.276
slaughtered in your own home.

54:07.277 --> 54:10.516
Well, who's to say that was the
only operation that he was running?

54:10.517 --> 54:12.236
I mean, maybe Prentice has other farms.

54:12.237 --> 54:14.036
Maybe it's not just cannabis.

54:14.037 --> 54:15.516
I mean, have you thought about that?

54:15.517 --> 54:16.756
Rhona, this is about McGuire.

54:16.757 --> 54:18.236
This is about the girl,

54:18.237 --> 54:19.877
and you wanting to save her.

54:23.477 --> 54:24.596
Her name's Zezi.

54:24.597 --> 54:25.676
I know.

54:25.677 --> 54:27.236
And I want to save her too.

54:27.237 --> 54:30.476
But I also want justice for the
murder of Carla and Prentice Hayes.

54:30.477 --> 54:31.876
Because they're more important?

54:31.877 --> 54:34.077
Because they're just as important.

54:40.237 --> 54:41.997
Get packed. We're going today.

55:01.757 --> 55:03.036
Where is everyone?

55:03.037 --> 55:04.516
Don't ask me, Billy.

55:04.517 --> 55:07.296
I'm the last person anyone
keeps in the loop around here.

55:18.637 --> 55:19.797
Calum?

55:20.797 --> 55:22.237
Calum!

55:24.237 --> 55:26.756
Billy! Billy!

55:27.957 --> 55:29.637
Billy!
