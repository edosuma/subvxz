00:04.637 --> 00:06.605
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.607 --> 00:10.642
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:12.678
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:15.280
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.282 --> 00:17.716
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.718 --> 00:20.119
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:21.587
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:23.022
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.024 --> 00:24.757
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.759 --> 00:26.592
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.761
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:28.763 --> 00:31.296
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.298 --> 00:33.465
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.803 --> 00:38.504
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.472
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:54.053
(engine revs)

00:56.589 --> 00:59.124
(serbian accent):
We're clear on the prize?

00:59.126 --> 01:01.660
Winner goes home with two cars.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.063
That have the latest nav system?

01:04.065 --> 01:07.099
For a guy who's never done this,
you're awful cocky.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.234
Have you calculated
your tire traction coefficients?

01:09.236 --> 01:11.837
Specific to barometric pressure?
'cause I have.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.505
And about 50 other variables.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.774
Statistically,
you have no chance.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.577
Green means go.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.285
(engines rev)

01:27.554 --> 01:29.588
(engines revving)

01:44.871 --> 01:47.372
(tires screeching)

01:50.543 --> 01:53.846
We never agreed on a course,
just the finish line.

01:56.182 --> 01:58.283
(engine revving)

02:16.136 --> 02:17.269
Oh!

02:17.271 --> 02:20.205
(tires screeching)

02:24.310 --> 02:27.346
(groans)

02:28.481 --> 02:31.884
That truck was obviously not
in my research.

02:31.886 --> 02:34.186
I'll take those keys.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.288
I actually can't give you
this car.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.756
It's a...

02:37.758 --> 02:39.791
It's a rental.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.828
Paige:
<i>Awful risky there, pal.</i>

02:42.830 --> 02:47.633
It's at nearly
a perfect 45-degree angle.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.302
How 'bout
you just drink it?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.470
Your dad...

02:51.472 --> 02:54.473
Drew's gonna... Be here soon.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.841
You excited
for the baseball game?

02:55.843 --> 02:59.178
I'm very... Excited.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.849
Yeah, you seem like it.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.818
Sylvester:
Oh...

03:06.820 --> 03:10.689
So now you owe a lamborghini
to a man named slavomir?

03:10.691 --> 03:13.292
With a serbian
gang tattoo.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.294
Great guy to owe a debt.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.962
No, no, no.
The question is

03:16.964 --> 03:21.700
How to face the same obstacle
and still manage to win.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.869
You accelerate toward the
driver's back fender,

03:23.871 --> 03:26.838
He passes your plane,
and you won't lose speed.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.373
But the better
question might be,

03:28.375 --> 03:30.709
Why the hell
were you doing this?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.511
It's a hobby.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.614
Or you're trying
to distract yourself.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.949
Question is, from what?

03:36.951 --> 03:38.984
(knocking)

03:38.986 --> 03:41.386
Hey.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.388
Uh, they're in the kitchen.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.457
Thanks.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.393
Gentlemen.
Paige: Hey, just a sec--

03:48.395 --> 03:49.628
Ralph's still
finishing breakfast.

03:49.630 --> 03:53.865
That this behavior syncs
with drew showing up last week?

03:53.867 --> 03:56.535
Pure coincidence. Pure.

03:56.537 --> 04:00.539
I found this stuffed
in ralph's backpack.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.873
Algebra quiz, d-minus.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.508
He said
he just...

04:03.510 --> 04:04.977
Forgot to study.

04:04.979 --> 04:08.013
He could have nailed this
dead asleep.
Yeah.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.015
Walter:
Is everything all right
with ralph and drew?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.683
I thought so.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.951
Drew's trying. He's taking him

04:12.953 --> 04:14.286
To a minor league baseball game
today.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.721
But then I see this.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.990
Maybe you can talk to ralph?

04:17.992 --> 04:19.992
Give him a little pep talk?

04:19.994 --> 04:21.426
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.894
Okay.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.596
Paige:
Ralph.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.265
Why don't you come
here for a second.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.567
Walter wants to
talk to you.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.904
Hey.

04:33.973 --> 04:36.341
So...

04:38.278 --> 04:39.978
Are you frustrated?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.913
Are you
distracted?

04:41.915 --> 04:44.049
You angry?

04:44.051 --> 04:47.052
Because this...

04:47.054 --> 04:50.322
This is not you.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.395
Maybe that's a good thing.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.630
(phone ringing)

04:58.632 --> 05:00.565
I need to go.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.468
Sylvester dodd.
Oh, hi, cabe.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.970
Okay, have fun.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.072
Sylvester:
What do you mean by that?
Let me get walter.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.707
I couldn't get anywhere.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.809
Thanks for trying.

05:10.811 --> 05:15.447
Okay, so cabe gave me
a bit of a rundown.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.782
Okay.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.417
Hey, cabe.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.026
(siren whoops)

05:30.330 --> 05:33.465
I just don't know if I can
handle seeing a murder victim.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.966
This is not
gonna be good.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.568
None of us are excited
about it.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.037
If you're all mentally prepared,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.772
Inside.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.609
Sylvester:
Oh, no, no.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.346
Oh... Ah.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.348
Ooh.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.050
Oh, that man is very dead.
Take it easy,

05:52.052 --> 05:54.019
Sylvester.
Look anywhere but the body.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.687
Cabe:
Detective jim archer.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.022
Robbery homicide.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.124
So you're the geniuses.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.059
Word got to
my lieutenant

06:01.061 --> 06:02.761
About you. I mean,
he's why you're here.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.763
But I'm running this.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.098
Mm-hmm. It's a pleasure
to be here.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.133
Does the dead man
have a name?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.768
Harold reid, 25 years old.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.938
Look, the reason
you're here is...

06:12.940 --> 06:15.040
He obviously had a tremendous
appreciation for music.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.043
Yeah, he was
a music industry blogger.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.078
He had a site called
sweetsound express.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.616
How could someone cut short
a life in its prime?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.818
Unless he was involved in
some nefarious activity
and he deserved it.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.154
Devil's advocate.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.156
We're thinking window entry.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.425
No. Door.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.093
The lock's undamaged,
but there's a little something

06:35.095 --> 06:39.131
Like if the perp knocked,
the kid answered and, bam,

06:39.133 --> 06:42.033
The bad guy hit him on the head
with the door and moved in.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.169
You were gonna tell us
the reason why we're here?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.171
Right behind you.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.639
Looks like some
math equation.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.508
Oh. I think I can fill this in.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.610
The place was picked clean.

06:51.612 --> 06:55.614
Desktop and laptop gone.
But there was this whiteboard.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.149
It appears to be
wiped down in a hurry.

06:57.151 --> 07:01.119
Maybe what was erased is similar
to these scraps?

07:01.121 --> 07:04.890
But we have no idea
what it means.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.626
It's an algorithm,
an optimizer.

07:10.530 --> 07:14.065
Plug in a collection
of variables-- say, uh...

07:14.067 --> 07:16.635
Player statistics
for a baseball team.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.170
That was fast.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.539
What would a music
blogger want with it?

07:20.541 --> 07:23.175
It's specific
to a certain product.

07:23.177 --> 07:24.743
I'm not sure what.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.078
Okay, more importantly,
does it have anything to do

07:27.080 --> 07:29.481
With who killed reid?

07:34.554 --> 07:38.490
There's redundant code.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.495
It's a programmer's way
of ensuring authorship.

07:43.497 --> 07:47.599
So, it's, um, like a painter
signing a canvas.

07:49.035 --> 07:52.003
He's using ascii. It's american
standard code. It's how, uh,

07:52.005 --> 07:53.472
A computer stores the alphabet.

07:53.474 --> 07:57.742
80 stands for p,
84 stands for t.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.211
P, pt, pt.

07:59.213 --> 08:00.178
Pt repeated.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.713
It's got
to be initials.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.081
Peyton temple.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.718
Peyton temple was a name found
on reid's phone records.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.154
Well, if he wrote this,
I'd like to ask him

08:09.156 --> 08:11.223
What he was using the equation
to optimize.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.191
You... <i>You'd</i>
<i>like to ask him?</i>

08:13.193 --> 08:14.559
Mm-hmm.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.027
This could be the killer.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.863
This could be anyone.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.232
How's your handle
on frame invocation theory?

08:20.234 --> 08:21.233
Because he used it

08:21.235 --> 08:22.667
In this equation,

08:22.669 --> 08:24.503
And it might be helpful
to understand it fully.

08:26.272 --> 08:30.275
I'll look up an address
on peyton temple, and...

08:30.277 --> 08:31.676
Let's go for a ride.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.879
(phone ringing)

08:33.881 --> 08:36.248
Sylvester:
I'm almost past the firewall

08:36.250 --> 08:39.217
On sweetsound express.
That's reid's music blog.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.785
There are numerous references

08:40.787 --> 08:43.021
To an upcoming post
on something called

08:43.023 --> 08:44.589
"the hit wizard."

08:44.591 --> 08:46.057
Uh, there's no
explanation past that.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.692
Toby, anything
on peyton temple?

08:47.694 --> 08:48.960
It's an old article

08:48.962 --> 08:50.762
About him being
a child music prodigy.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.131
Synthesizer, electronic sound.
There's not much past that.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.966
But I did find this, though.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.069
No answer, so
we'll circle back.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.539
Okay, what if, uh,
reid's cell phone gps

09:00.541 --> 09:02.274
Indicated that he was here
at temple's house

09:02.276 --> 09:03.675
For about three hours
last night?

09:03.677 --> 09:05.143
Would that validate
entering the premises?

09:05.145 --> 09:08.113
How did you get
that information?

09:08.115 --> 09:10.282
It's not like
we hacked his account.

09:10.284 --> 09:14.219
Interesting, but not enough
for a warrant,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.655
So we'll circle back.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.325
See you at
the garage.

09:22.194 --> 09:23.762
Paige:
Where's walter going?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.163
Um...

09:25.165 --> 09:27.265
Walter, is your mind
on the homicide,

09:27.267 --> 09:29.601
Or is this the same
agitation from earlier?

09:29.603 --> 09:32.237
Oh, I think you've overshot
your analysis of me for today.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.005
You are hunting big
adrenaline game

09:34.007 --> 09:35.173
Because of your
high intelligence.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.309
You will keep
stalking bigger thrills

09:37.311 --> 09:39.644
Unless you deal
with your issues.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.750
High-risk activities aren't
an emotional distraction.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.152
They are relaxing.

09:47.154 --> 09:50.822
When risk is involved,
it occupies my entire brain,

09:50.824 --> 09:53.959
Freeing me from other thoughts.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.027
It's meditative.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.832
He's practicing
freudian displacement.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.267
It's when you pursue one thing,

10:02.269 --> 10:05.070
But you're really
thinking about another.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.871
So, him jumping the fence?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.206
He's meditating.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.809
Paige:
Walter? Walter?

10:10.811 --> 10:11.977
What are you doing?

10:11.979 --> 10:14.946
With reid just before
he wound up dead.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.048
Either he killed reid,
or he knows something about it.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.117
Worth some effort.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.894
(electrical hissing, groaning)

10:42.675 --> 10:45.143
(groans)

10:45.145 --> 10:47.012
(barking)

10:47.014 --> 10:48.079
Oh!

10:49.248 --> 10:50.248
Okay, okay...

10:50.250 --> 10:53.852
You're pretty stupid
to show up unarmed.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.353
Actually, I have a 197 iq,

10:55.355 --> 10:56.721
But I will grant you

10:56.723 --> 10:57.989
I've been
engaging in some,

10:57.991 --> 11:00.392
Uh, risky behavior.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.761
Now, I like...
I like dogs,

11:02.763 --> 11:04.362
But, uh, if you
call yours off

11:04.364 --> 11:06.164
We could talk
about a murder...
(barking)

11:06.166 --> 11:08.033
...You're involved in.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.335
Come on, bubba.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.141
For real, you think
I had something to do

11:16.143 --> 11:17.175
With reid getting killed?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.277
He was my friend.
You're insane.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.179
Especially you.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.114
Hard to argue
at the moment, mr. Temple.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.683
Walter: You still
haven't given us

11:24.685 --> 11:25.784
An explanation for
your whereabouts

11:25.786 --> 11:26.851
During the time
of the murder.

11:26.853 --> 11:27.952
Because I don't know you.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.354
My friend is dead,

11:29.356 --> 11:31.423
You're the second person
to invade my house today,

11:31.425 --> 11:34.292
And no idea why
I should trust you people.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.128
I am law enforcement,
on lapd order.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.463
And if this happened earlier,

11:38.465 --> 11:40.031
Why didn't you call police?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.166
I was going to,

11:41.168 --> 11:43.134
But to be honest, I was scared.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.136
And last night, I was working

11:45.138 --> 11:46.304
At a studio
in burbank.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.338
There's ten people
who'll confirm.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.873
We're gonna need those names.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.775
But let's, maybe, start over.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.077
Take a breath.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.344
We're here to help.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.479
Octave cat?

11:54.481 --> 11:55.980
The ultimate synthesizer.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.282
It's dusty.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.483
I have one
just like it.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.484
I built it
from parts.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.785
It's the perfect
synthesis

12:00.787 --> 12:01.786
Of sound and
engineering.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.221
I'm sorry. It
may not look it,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.422
But there's an order here
I don't want disturbed.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.423
Thank you.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.726
Sound and engineering.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.427
You're a
music prodigy.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.730
The algorithm you wrote
was a music program.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.264
Reid was a music blogger.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.766
But what is it being used for?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.068
What does it calculate
the perfect version of?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.837
If it was what reid was calling
"the hit wizard,"

12:18.839 --> 12:19.904
We may have the answer.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.109
I invented a program
to aggregate data

12:24.111 --> 12:25.477
From every hit pop song

12:25.479 --> 12:27.145
From the last
50 years.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.780
With minor variations in input--

12:28.782 --> 12:30.749
Gender of artist,
time signature--

12:30.751 --> 12:33.084
Crank out a mathematically
"perfect" pop tune.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.986
And this is being used today?

12:34.988 --> 12:36.154
Macklemore!

12:36.156 --> 12:37.288
That's the only explanation.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.157
Or not, toby.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.159
Two weeks ago, some employees
were listening to the radio

12:41.161 --> 12:43.428
And I heard some songs
I'm certain used the technology.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.796
Someone copied you?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.197
It was taken off a hard drive

12:46.199 --> 12:48.333
That was stolen
from this house ten months ago.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.467
Hence the dog.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.236
Do you suspect anyone?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.471
I only talked about it
with other like minds.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.873
Mathematical types.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.341
But... Can't
trust anyone.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.976
But you heard the song,
you told reid

12:57.978 --> 12:59.310
And he wanted to write about it?

12:59.312 --> 13:00.912
Yeah, I heard that song
and six others.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.047
All hits, major artists,
playing now.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.415
You should be, like,
a zillionaire.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.151
I'd rather just
have my friend back

13:06.153 --> 13:07.385
And get on with my life.

13:09.388 --> 13:10.989
Well, any credible
artist would be shredded

13:10.991 --> 13:12.457
If their hits were
revealed to have been

13:12.459 --> 13:13.992
Written by a machine.
It is good motive.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.460
Temple:
It could be an artist,

13:15.462 --> 13:18.263
Record company, management...
I have no idea.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.165
You let us help.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.167
We'll help compile
a list of suspects.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.201
Look.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.003
I'm not trying to open this up

13:25.005 --> 13:26.371
To potentially threaten
more people.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.273
You understand?
This is my fault.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.441
My friend is dead,
all right?

13:30.443 --> 13:32.076
All in secret, then.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.945
You'll only reveal
the list to me.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.246
Cabe:
And if someone's after you,

13:35.248 --> 13:37.448
You're gonna
need protection.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.950
I'll run it all
through lapd.

13:41.387 --> 13:42.554
Come on.

13:42.556 --> 13:43.955
I'll show you my octave.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.164
That sounded dirty.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.499
Maybe it was
supposed to.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.234
He's cute.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.509
Temple:
These songs,

14:04.511 --> 14:05.844
These artists.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.445
Almost certain they used
the technology.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.514
Okay, so the question is not
only who had the most to lose

14:09.516 --> 14:10.615
From it being exposed,

14:10.617 --> 14:12.183
But who would kill
to keep it quiet?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.852
Well, it's not gonna
be a short list.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.553
The music business
is disgusting, so heads up.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.258
Is that why you
left it all behind?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.493
I believed in
what I was playing

14:22.495 --> 14:26.631
Didn't get much of a
response from the media

14:26.633 --> 14:28.466
Or the labels.
So...

14:28.468 --> 14:29.567
I gave it up.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.203
Decided to put it in a box.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.038
So you invented
a smart algorithm,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.240
Which is also very cynical.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.574
It's bubble-gum pop.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.544
I could make
a couple extra bucks.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.547
Why didn't you rewrite the
program after it was stolen?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.349
Reid wanted me to.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.618
He was always saying,
"fight back," and...

14:46.620 --> 14:48.887
I would have,
if he were still, um...

14:54.360 --> 14:57.095
I mean, how many times
do I need to get screwed

14:57.097 --> 14:59.063
Before I learn my lesson,
you know?

14:59.065 --> 15:02.200
Guess I'm just not meant to be
in the music business.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.104
Artist who hates his own art.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.505
How certain are we

15:07.507 --> 15:09.307
That ke$ha is on this list?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.308
Not at all.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.542
And who cares?

15:11.544 --> 15:13.411
Why are you so fascinated

15:13.413 --> 15:15.680
By who's making fake music?

15:15.682 --> 15:17.682
I am an indefatigable
seeker of the truth.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.050
I have a visceral
reaction

15:19.052 --> 15:20.652
When the world tries
to sell me caca,

15:20.654 --> 15:23.588
And this list is gonna
confirm my instincts.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.323
You're real fun.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.692
What a hoot of a boyfriend
you'd make.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.329
Did you hear that?

15:31.331 --> 15:34.198
Yeah, she just laid you out.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.566
She just referenced me

15:35.568 --> 15:38.269
In the same sentence
as "boyfriend."

15:38.271 --> 15:42.707
I have the world's
most perfect instincts.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.676
I saw this coming.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.210
Monster trucks?

15:46.212 --> 15:47.512
A legit first date.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.515
Just need to find
the right time to ask.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.283
What about now?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.651
Eh...

15:53.653 --> 15:55.620
She was showing
this vague interest

15:55.622 --> 15:57.455
In our new friend earlier.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.557
I need her mind clear.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.060
Is what you're doing
also freudian displacement?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.696
Because you're afraid
of being rejected?

16:04.698 --> 16:06.097
Maybe for
someone else?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.132
Music is sexy.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.202
Ah. Were you, like,
a groupie or something?

16:11.204 --> 16:12.737
Absolutely not.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.372
Toby:
Interesting
body language.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.541
It's defensive,
turning away,

16:16.543 --> 16:17.675
Yet eyes begging for follow-up.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.744
I was thinking
about drew and ralph

16:19.746 --> 16:20.712
At the baseball game.

16:20.714 --> 16:21.713
Just confess.

16:21.715 --> 16:23.381
There may have been a time

16:23.383 --> 16:24.649
I gave singing a shot.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.317
Well, let's
hear it.
No.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.152
It's private now.
For me to listen to

16:28.154 --> 16:29.487
When I'm feeling
nostalgic.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.322
Walter:
Hey, guys?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.324
Temple pointed us
to a suspect.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.127
I think we
have someone.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.430
Lucky the king.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.765
Manages hard-core
hip hop artists.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.667
Has two songs
on the list,

16:42.669 --> 16:44.035
His only
top 40 hits.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.303
Goes to logic.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.171
Guy whose roster is all about

16:47.173 --> 16:49.240
Street credibility--
he would lose a fortune

16:49.242 --> 16:50.641
If it came out that
his artists were using

16:50.643 --> 16:52.176
A machine to generate hits.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.644
Oh, yeah.
His company would collapse.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.246
And he's psycho,
so there's that.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.348
He's been shot three
separate times.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.650
Four bullets are still
in his body.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.219
Cabe said that there
were several calls

17:01.221 --> 17:03.521
To lucky's management,
so they were in contact.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.724
Yeah. And there's no way
lucky's talking to the cops

17:06.726 --> 17:07.725
If they walk through the door.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.427
You know what I'd do?

17:09.429 --> 17:10.661
Get in this guy's face

17:10.663 --> 17:12.530
And just accuse him
of being involved.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.698
Brilliant.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.566
Toby:
It is. Because
I'd have planted

17:15.568 --> 17:17.802
A listening device
in his office.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.771
Yeah, if he was involved,

17:19.773 --> 17:21.773
His next conversation
would be to his accomplice

17:21.775 --> 17:24.442
Or-- if he farmed
it out-- the killer.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.110
Yeah, that's a good idea,
gettin' in his face.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.079
You heard me just say
he was psycho, right?

17:28.081 --> 17:29.113
I got no problem with that.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.114
I'm gonna go with you

17:30.116 --> 17:31.349
And help you
plant the bug.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.184
Whoa, whoa...
Go with me?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.452
Why do I have to go?

17:34.454 --> 17:35.820
Well, he used your technology.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.088
He'll talk to you.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.690
You can pretend
I'm your security.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.527
Or I'm a friend looking
for an audition.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.829
I do have a history
as a battle rapper.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.698
Please do not subject us
to an example.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.201
Hey.
You could be his lawyer.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.070
I've done that before.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.338
â™ª

17:54.340 --> 17:55.606
Sylvester:
<i>My research said</i>

17:55.608 --> 17:57.608
The basement entrance
is around the side.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.110
We'll go set up down there.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.146
Toby:
Lucky the king has a lambo.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.148
Reminds me of a debt
someone owes.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.819
We doing this or what, man?

18:07.821 --> 18:11.789
Yeah, uh, you're just gonna have
a little conversation.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.858
Toby will pick out
the bug.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.260
Really?
Because I'm freaking out, too,

18:16.262 --> 18:19.197
Or are you just saying that
because you feel no fear?

18:19.199 --> 18:20.398
You don't
feel fear?
No.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.533
That's really great
to hear right now.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.402
Don't worry.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.870
With you in the room,

18:25.872 --> 18:28.139
There's very little chance
he'll resort to violence.

18:32.311 --> 18:35.546
Look... Whoever you guys are,

18:35.548 --> 18:36.747
Whatever firm you're with...

18:36.749 --> 18:38.316
Melvoy
and grant.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.718
Yeah.
Whatever.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.754
I have no idea what theft
you're talking about, okay?

18:43.756 --> 18:45.857
These songs were written
by professionals

18:45.859 --> 18:47.558
And overseen by me.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.160
We both know that's not true.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.729
Those songs
were written by

18:51.731 --> 18:52.797
My client's
stolen software.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.699
I don't got no clue

18:54.701 --> 18:55.900
What you're talking about.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.435
Rest assured,
if we wanted to prove

18:57.437 --> 18:58.736
Theft and usage, we could.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.738
Our client just wants a
few minutes of your time

19:00.740 --> 19:02.340
In front of
witnesses.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.774
Or we could file
a lawsuit.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.476
In which case, you might want to

19:05.478 --> 19:07.411
Change the name of the company
to temple management,

19:07.413 --> 19:08.846
Because he will
own this office

19:08.848 --> 19:11.149
And your cars
and every asset

19:11.151 --> 19:12.783
You've ever
possessed.
Temple:
Okay.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.619
Before we start
serving papers here,

19:14.621 --> 19:16.687
Can I just talk
to you privately?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.723
I mean, I hate the
idea of a lawsuit.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.662
Yeah.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.707
I don't know who you are

19:36.709 --> 19:38.543
Or what the hell you want...

19:38.545 --> 19:39.944
Okay, look, I don't
want your money.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.679
I called this guy out
of a yellow pages,

19:41.681 --> 19:42.780
'cause I knew
I couldn't get in

19:42.782 --> 19:44.649
Without
a lawyer.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.884
Lucky:
Well, you and your lawyers are
about to get tossed out of here.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.619
Temple:
Just hear me out, okay?

19:48.621 --> 19:49.854
Do you know
harold reid?

19:49.856 --> 19:52.323
I don't know who
you're talking about, man.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.658
Come on, man,
you know him.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.227
He called you asking about
the same program I am.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.228
Lucky:
All right, I hear you...

20:01.867 --> 20:04.702
Mr.... Uh,
mr. Curtis...

20:05.704 --> 20:06.671
Do you have the time?

20:06.673 --> 20:09.240
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.474
Okay.

20:14.646 --> 20:15.880
(quietly):
I couldn't do it.

20:15.882 --> 20:16.981
He got killed.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.950
Policeman called me
asking about it,

20:18.952 --> 20:20.818
Using your name.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.987
Now, I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.655
You can keep
the money,

20:24.657 --> 20:25.990
You can keep
the program.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.892
Plant it under
your seat.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.860
It's got to be closer
to the phone.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.762
(whispers):
Give it to me.

20:39.004 --> 20:40.705
(clears throat)

20:40.707 --> 20:42.373
I just don't want my
life threatened again.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.942
I had nothing to do with
a threat on your life.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.944
Because if I was
going to threaten you,

20:46.946 --> 20:48.946
I'd have your little ass
curled up in a corner,

20:48.948 --> 20:50.381
Weeping like a child.

20:52.951 --> 20:53.951
Okay.

20:53.953 --> 20:54.986
Think we're
good here, guys.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.254
We should
probably leave.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.990
You all want to sue me?

20:58.992 --> 21:00.591
Sue me.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.293
Just get the hell
out of my office.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.034
Toby:
Walter, anything?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.936
(dial tone, dialing)

21:11.938 --> 21:14.572
He's dialing the phone
from the line in his office.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.974
Must be something
he wants kept private.

21:16.976 --> 21:17.975
We may be on
to something.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.043
You're kidding.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.279
This actually worked?

21:21.281 --> 21:23.447
Man: Hello, this is ocean west
I.T. Services for business...

21:23.449 --> 21:25.616
Sylvester: Doesn't sound like
he's calling an assassin.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.518
Maybe it's code.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.521
Or maybe he does
have internet problems.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.990
What kind of hip-hop mogul deals
with his own web service issues?

21:32.992 --> 21:34.592
A control freak?

21:35.495 --> 21:37.762
Walter: So, we'll
keep monitoring him,

21:37.764 --> 21:39.397
But maybe he is
a control freak.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.666
Sylvester: Either way,
the killer is still out there.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.834
The hell was that?

21:43.836 --> 21:45.503
Something not normal.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.605
Let's discuss it
outside the van.

21:59.785 --> 22:02.453
Maybe a short in the ac?

22:02.455 --> 22:03.587
(explosion)

22:03.589 --> 22:04.588
Whoa!

22:18.804 --> 22:22.473
Paige: I'm completely shocked.
My-my hands are still shaking.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.841
Van's blown to hell,

22:23.843 --> 22:27.445
That he had no clue
about the car bomb.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.380
I could swear
to be the queen of England,

22:29.382 --> 22:30.548
It doesn't make it true.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.817
His alibi for reid's murder--

22:32.819 --> 22:34.819
He was at his daughter's
fourth-grade adaptation

22:34.821 --> 22:38.556
Said we could confirm it
with his head of security

22:38.558 --> 22:40.391
And every parent
that was in the audience.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.560
That doesn't mean
he didn't hire it out.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.495
Well, if he did, he's not
telling us about it.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.697
He named a very powerful
attorney, he's done talking.

22:46.699 --> 22:50.368
All right, we'll need
area surveillance footage,

22:50.370 --> 22:52.536
Anything that shows the van,
whoever planted that bomb.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.506
Someone's trying to
wipe this kid out,

22:55.508 --> 22:57.608
And doesn't care
who he wipes out with him.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.044
This might be more
than you can chew.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.818
(crowd cheering)

23:12.991 --> 23:16.060
Peanuts?

23:20.866 --> 23:22.933
You feeling okay?

23:35.680 --> 23:38.549
Okay, whoever bombed us, they've
probably been following us

23:38.551 --> 23:40.184
Since the first time
we went to temple's house.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.887
You say that like people
go around bombing other people.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.089
Uh, empathy's not
his strong suit.

23:45.091 --> 23:48.459
Aftermath photos show they wired
right into the ignition switch.

23:48.461 --> 23:51.162
The bomber wasn't adept enough
to tighten everything,

23:51.164 --> 23:53.063
Or we wouldn't have gotten
that ten second warning.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.598
You know, the more
I think about it,

23:54.600 --> 23:56.133
The less I want to see that list

23:56.135 --> 23:57.668
Of the artists
who used the hit wizard.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.637
Not what we're
talking about, toby.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.705
I mean, what if
jack white is on that list.

24:01.707 --> 24:02.940
I can't handle that.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.608
He's not.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.677
(cell phone rings)

24:09.181 --> 24:10.848
Drew?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.716
Is everything all right?

24:12.718 --> 24:15.619
No, maybe this was a bad idea.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.621
It's ralph, he-he's, uh...

24:17.623 --> 24:18.589
Not having a good time.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.224
He hasn't said a word all day.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.759
I told you he can be quiet.

24:21.761 --> 24:25.196
I-I know, but maybe baseball
wasn't the right call.

24:25.198 --> 24:28.699
Well, you're his dad, so...

24:29.868 --> 24:31.202
...Find some
common ground.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.671
You ready for another
professional assessment?

24:33.673 --> 24:35.606
You gonna deny
ralph your help?

24:42.113 --> 24:44.181
Can I, um... Can I speak
to him for a second?

24:44.183 --> 24:45.549
Oh, uh...

24:45.551 --> 24:46.717
Walter wants to get on.

24:46.719 --> 24:47.718
Okay.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.187
You may consider
buying a program

24:50.189 --> 24:54.859
Then asking him if he can try
to improve fielder placement

24:54.861 --> 24:56.060
And the batting order,
he may enjoy that.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.495
Thanks.

24:59.030 --> 25:01.098
Thank you.

25:02.567 --> 25:03.734
I got something.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.871
Guy walks like military,
cop or both.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.172
He's packing.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.707
Under his shirt
and on his ankle.

25:09.709 --> 25:10.975
Security.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.577
He's gonna be
a security guy.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.881
Lucky had that security thug
in the office.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.750
His alibi witness was
his head of protection.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.619
So, whoever planted that bomb,
like I said,

25:21.621 --> 25:22.887
They could have been hired out.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.822
Show me getting
out of his car.

25:27.726 --> 25:30.227
Stop, he didn't account
for that camera angle.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.929
That placard says
night ridge security.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.797
Heavy in the
music business.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.233
Everybody in law enforcement
knows these guys.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.068
It's big money.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.137
If a rich music biz dude
wanted to get rid

25:40.139 --> 25:41.605
Of reid and our friend temple,

25:41.607 --> 25:42.640
They could hire the job out.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.807
Toby:
This guy's I.D. Would

25:43.809 --> 25:45.776
Most certainly be
in night ridge's files.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.745
Warrant'll take days.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.580
But I may have a work around.

25:49.582 --> 25:50.881
Skirt the law a little.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.750
Cabe? Skirting the law?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.752
Walter is rubbing off on him.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.953
I take it personally

25:55.955 --> 25:57.821
When someone goes after
one of our own.

25:57.823 --> 25:59.089
I'll explain in the car.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.224
This may be a little...

26:00.226 --> 26:01.825
I'm in! I'm past
night ridge's security.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.694
You are?

26:03.696 --> 26:05.095
Not surprising.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.997
Security firms, not so tough.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.799
Scanning the face
from the surveillance video

26:08.801 --> 26:10.801
Against night ridge
personnel files.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.703
Got him.

26:12.705 --> 26:15.306
The guy in the surveillance
video is dustin mcbride.

26:15.308 --> 26:17.608
Ex-military, ex-cop.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.909
Here's his home address.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.712
I'll get this to archer
in robbery homicide.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.347
If this guy, mcbride,
tried to kill you,

26:23.349 --> 26:25.015
It's likely he killed reid.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.618
We'll let lapd handle
grabbing him up.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.254
Okay, so, what do we do now?

26:30.256 --> 26:31.855
Go ahead and make
the arrest, or...?

26:31.857 --> 26:33.791
It's in lapd's hands now.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.760
We need to stay here and
find out who hired mcbride.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.095
Why don't I
show you my octave.

26:38.097 --> 26:41.765
Here's the one I rebuilt.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.134
Honestly, I don't know much
about how it plays, but...

26:44.136 --> 26:46.670
It's a beautiful
machine.

26:46.672 --> 26:50.841
Cars, tractors, elevators,
I love machines.

26:50.843 --> 26:54.912
Analog amplifiers,
pristine socket chips.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.247
(sighs)
perfect transistors.

26:57.249 --> 27:00.150
I'll bet the sound is as warm
as a cat in the sun, huh?

27:00.152 --> 27:01.352
Fire it up.

27:01.354 --> 27:03.854
Nah, I haven't played
in so long,

27:03.856 --> 27:06.890
I'm definitely rusty.

27:06.892 --> 27:10.327
I put all this away
a long time ago.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.998
But I should get going home.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.635
Just want to call and check in
on reid's folks, if that's okay.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.273
You know, uh, I'll
give you a ride.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.776
You shouldn't be alone before
this is all wrapped up.

27:25.778 --> 27:26.777
You've already
done enough, man,

27:26.779 --> 27:29.146
Helping me out
with all this, so...

27:29.148 --> 27:33.083
You know, there are
similarities between you and us.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.918
Come on, man,
there are no similarities.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.919
I'm not one of you.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.688
I barely ever
leave my house.

27:37.690 --> 27:38.856
Well, we have support.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.792
That's the difference.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.061
Makes me miss my friend.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.263
I wish I had advice for you,

27:46.265 --> 27:49.099
But I'm bad with emotional
conversations.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.301
My advice for you--

27:51.303 --> 27:52.970
Don't hide.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.071
From anything.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.006
Nothing good
comes from it.

27:58.843 --> 27:59.943
Whoa!

28:01.279 --> 28:03.180
Toby:
Hey, walt, you here?

28:03.182 --> 28:04.948
(groaning)

28:07.052 --> 28:08.852
Hey, walter.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.854
Walter!

28:21.132 --> 28:23.267
Toby:
<i>Electrocuted twice in one day.</i>

28:23.269 --> 28:24.468
That has to be
a record.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.103
Cabe:
You got a look at his face?

28:26.105 --> 28:28.372
Yeah, I'm certain
it was dustin mcbride.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.807
Could've just killed temple.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.041
They must want him
for something.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.777
We know that mcbride
is security,

28:33.779 --> 28:35.179
The question is-- for who?

28:35.181 --> 28:36.814
Mcbride's file
at night ridge has a list

28:36.816 --> 28:38.449
Of 20 regular clients.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.417
Get what you can
on all 20 names.

28:40.419 --> 28:44.221
But that list of the artists
who used the hit wizard program,

28:44.223 --> 28:48.392
Maybe you needed a behaviorist
going over that list.

28:50.361 --> 28:52.463
In the loft.

28:52.465 --> 28:54.431
Oh, my god...

28:54.433 --> 28:56.433
"anywhere but here" was written
by a computer?

28:56.435 --> 29:00.738
And "hold on." walter, I don't
think I can handle this.

29:00.740 --> 29:03.140
Hey, numbnuts, buckle down.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.374
We got a man to save.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.443
Legitimate acts,
singer-songwriters.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.079
Careers built on
a foundation of credibility.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.380
Stray silence.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.049
(chuckles)

29:12.051 --> 29:13.484
Sean redclay...
Fraud would torpedo them.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.385
That would be like

29:15.387 --> 29:17.421
If you heard springsteen
was on this list.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.124
He's not, thank god.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.526
They're all managed
by an owen sugar.

29:22.528 --> 29:26.063
He's on the night ridge list,
a client of dustin mcbride.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.998
One guy managing three clients

29:28.000 --> 29:31.235
That would have been ruined
at the reveal of the hit wizard.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.337
That's a fortune
in lost revenue.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.872
We need to find out
where he lives.

29:34.874 --> 29:38.108
Paige: Oh, pantheon villas
in west hollywood.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.244
Huge parties, furious neighbors.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.880
Owen sugar's in the tabloids
all the time.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.783
Happy, get
your laptop.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.384
And every surveillance
tool you have.

29:47.386 --> 29:51.321
We'll do the research of the
building layout in the car.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.423
And we're not calling
cabe because...

29:53.425 --> 29:55.526
Why involve authorities
when confronting a killer?

29:55.528 --> 29:57.494
We're not confronting him,
we'll be next door.

29:57.496 --> 29:58.428
Then we may confront him.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.496
Happy:
Let's go, move!

30:07.338 --> 30:09.406
I see mcbride.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.442
Here.

30:14.345 --> 30:16.146
Yeah, that's owen sugar.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.281
The one on the left.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.316
Happy, any sign
of temple?

30:19.318 --> 30:20.484
I see a body.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.451
Is he alive?

30:21.453 --> 30:22.986
Heat signature says yes.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.988
But he's not moving.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.957
Guys.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.458
Man: We didn't snatch him
to watch him sleep,

30:28.460 --> 30:30.561
We need to know who him and his
friend, harold reid, talked to.

30:30.563 --> 30:31.829
Until we find out
how wide this went,

30:31.831 --> 30:34.398
We can't start
cleaning it up.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.500
I'll rouse him.

30:36.502 --> 30:40.504
All right, get him talking,
then, hey, put him down.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.939
Make him
go away, okay?

30:41.941 --> 30:43.307
Uh, we can't let that happen.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.575
There's the back staircase.

30:44.577 --> 30:46.043
It's like a fire escape.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.511
It leads to sugar's
service entrance.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.979
Can you get past the lock?

30:48.981 --> 30:50.547
Walter, please.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.082
Okay, before we do anything,

30:52.084 --> 30:53.517
We'll need to get temple
out of there.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.453
Now, toby, I'll need help
hauling him if he can't walk.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.121
Paige, sylvester,
you watch from here.

30:58.123 --> 31:00.457
Warn us if mcbride goes
anywhere near that back room.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.592
And call cabe.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.339
Paige:
Sugwhat did I say?Ne.

31:15.341 --> 31:16.506
I can't see mcbride.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.575
Sugar:
Yeah, nothing to it.

31:18.577 --> 31:21.445
Uh-huh.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.513
No, we're here.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.349
Just do what I told you to do.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.617
Thank you.

31:26.619 --> 31:29.119
And call me immediately.
I want to hear.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.455
It's him! It's temple!

31:31.457 --> 31:34.625
Temple, wake up.

31:34.627 --> 31:36.093
(sighs)
poor guy.

31:38.129 --> 31:39.162
We need to move fast.

31:39.164 --> 31:41.365
Sylvester:
Uh, uh, guys?

31:41.367 --> 31:45.969
Where's he grabbing garbage bags
and duct tape.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.604
Are we clear to go?

31:50.074 --> 31:51.608
Oh, he's coming towards you.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.144
Wait, he-he's stopped.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.946
He's talking to sugar.
I'd say you got

31:55.948 --> 31:57.281
Five seconds to get
out of there.
Plan b.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.049
No, no, no, no!
We can go right now!

31:59.051 --> 32:01.051
We go, mcbride comes back
wondering where temple is.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.653
And the first place he's gonna
look is the back stairway.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.554
So plan b. Happy, you're
prepared just in case?
I'm prepared.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.657
You're paying attention
to this heroism, correct?

32:06.659 --> 32:08.492
Oh, you crazy shrink!

32:12.130 --> 32:14.431
Toby:
Mr. Sugar, a million apologies

32:14.433 --> 32:16.667
For barging in, but I tried
your office 20 times.

32:16.669 --> 32:18.568
And I knew if you
just heard one song,

32:18.570 --> 32:21.138
You'd know what kind of gold
mine you were talking to.

32:22.607 --> 32:25.475
(beat-boxing)

32:25.477 --> 32:27.010
He's a dead man.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.111
...Your boy toby curtis.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.479
Right?

32:29.481 --> 32:32.616
(whimpering )

32:37.455 --> 32:40.991
Guys, we're all intelligent
adults, business people.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.292
I am well aware
of the age-old struggle

32:42.294 --> 32:44.127
Between artist and management.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.162
Paige:
Walter!

32:45.164 --> 32:46.463
It's toby! He's in trouble!

32:46.465 --> 32:48.532
Happy, keep going,
keep going.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.536
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

32:52.538 --> 32:54.171
We have peyton temple.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.639
You pull him up,
we'll take you to temple.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.708
He's who you want.

32:57.710 --> 32:58.976
Not us.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.377
What the hell?
Get him up.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.313
(grunting)

33:03.315 --> 33:06.249
Happy, they've
got them at gunpoint.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.521
Temple's at our
headquarters downtown.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.190
No police, no protection.

33:13.192 --> 33:14.257
Why are you bending
over for them?

33:14.259 --> 33:15.292
What choice do we have?

33:15.294 --> 33:16.493
They're gonna kill us, too.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.528
No, they're businessmen, right?

33:18.530 --> 33:20.731
Let's go.

33:20.733 --> 33:22.499
Come on, move.

33:26.771 --> 33:29.306
There's no muzak.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.041
Just saying.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.311
It's really worth killing over?

33:34.313 --> 33:36.046
Pop songs?

33:36.048 --> 33:38.015
Stop talking.

33:39.283 --> 33:41.151
The artistry,
you know?

33:41.153 --> 33:43.587
Touching people's souls?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.324
Hey, what are you doing
with your hands?

33:50.561 --> 33:52.229
(loud bang)

33:52.231 --> 33:53.263
What the hell was that?!

33:53.265 --> 33:56.133
I love machines.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.135
(whirring)

34:06.511 --> 34:08.779
(grunting)

34:08.781 --> 34:10.347
(elevator bell dings)

34:14.585 --> 34:16.653
Come on out, fellas.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.528
Geez, walt.

34:24.530 --> 34:27.697
You know, it's like everyone
in l.A. Has a lambo but you.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.669
The lapd extends their thanks
and asks a favor.

34:32.671 --> 34:35.272
Found this in sugar's condo.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.406
Figure out what's on it.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.507
It may belong to your friend.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.277
So, if we could prove

34:40.279 --> 34:42.145
That owen sugar used stolen

34:42.147 --> 34:47.284
Would it be confiscated?
Auctioned for cheap?

34:47.286 --> 34:49.286
By... Tonight?

34:49.288 --> 34:51.755
Try, like, three years.

34:53.691 --> 34:56.193
That's it. That's my algorithm.

34:56.195 --> 35:01.198
Oh. Here's a log
of who hired sugar to use it.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.600
Matches your
artist list exactly.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.769
Millions in revenue.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.471
Give us five minutes
to log everything

35:07.473 --> 35:09.306
On the hard drive for cabe

35:09.308 --> 35:11.374
And then we'll give it
back to you again.
Cool.

35:13.244 --> 35:15.112
I was

35:15.114 --> 35:17.781
Pleased to hear you didn't
drop off that roof.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.250
You appreciated my heroism?

35:20.252 --> 35:22.185
It was idiotic.

35:22.187 --> 35:23.220
But ballsy.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.589
(gentle music playing)
um...

35:25.591 --> 35:27.457
Happy?

35:28.893 --> 35:32.329
Just curious,
what are your plans for...?

35:39.237 --> 35:42.272
What I've missed the most in all
the years since I gave it up

35:42.274 --> 35:44.207
Is the perfection of harmony.

35:44.209 --> 35:47.344
See, a machine can only
copy it, can't make it

35:47.346 --> 35:49.679
Because the perfection

35:49.681 --> 35:51.481
Is in the tiny mistakes.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.184
Which makes it human.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.253
(gentle melody plays)

35:59.824 --> 36:02.359
(paige humming along)

36:02.361 --> 36:03.727
Oh, you know it?

36:03.729 --> 36:05.162
(laughs)

36:05.164 --> 36:07.597
â™ª can't take my eyes
off of you â™ª

36:07.599 --> 36:08.732
Come on in.

36:08.734 --> 36:12.302
â™ª you'd be like
heaven to touch â™ª

36:12.304 --> 36:15.205
â™ª I want to hold you so much

36:15.207 --> 36:18.208
â™ª at long last,
love has arrived â™ª

36:18.210 --> 36:21.845
â™ª and I thank god I'm alive

36:21.847 --> 36:24.247
â™ª you're just
too good to be true â™ª

36:24.249 --> 36:27.384
â™ª can't take my eyes
off of you. â™ª

36:27.386 --> 36:29.486
(music stops)

36:32.723 --> 36:34.824
Paige:
Uh, oh.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.693
Oh, ralph.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.261
How was your day? Good?

36:38.263 --> 36:41.331
Hi.
Mm-hmm.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.300
Hey.
Thank you

36:43.302 --> 36:44.968
For your <i>moneyball</i> idea.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.870
Ralph really engaged.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.872
He loved it.
Mm-hmm.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.274
Um...

36:51.276 --> 36:54.311
You seem to have
something more on your mind.

36:54.313 --> 36:56.713
Well, I know baseball.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.416
And when I tried to
talk to ralph about it

36:59.418 --> 37:00.850
From my perspective,
he didn't get it.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.852
And then I gave him
the idea, your idea.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.354
And he's talking to me

37:04.356 --> 37:05.755
About statistics
and probabilities.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.991
And then I didn't get it.

37:07.993 --> 37:11.795
I just wish there was a way
for us speak the same baseball.

37:11.797 --> 37:14.898
You wait here.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.505
Okay, batter up.

37:27.545 --> 37:29.846
Yowzah!

37:31.449 --> 37:32.649
When it spins,

37:32.651 --> 37:34.251
Air passes faster

37:34.253 --> 37:35.385
Over one side of the ball,

37:35.387 --> 37:36.987
Reducing air pressure.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.288
That's bernoulli's principle.

37:38.290 --> 37:39.656
Now, when the ball
gets dragged down

37:39.658 --> 37:41.291
That's the magnus effect.

37:41.293 --> 37:42.826
Okay, drew?

37:42.828 --> 37:45.428
That ralph is high heat.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.830
Comes at the top of the order.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.431
Shows them you mean business.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.332
Cool.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.001
Now, drew?

37:51.003 --> 37:52.636
Try to release

37:52.638 --> 37:54.371
A quarter second later.

37:55.906 --> 37:58.041
Okay.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.582
(drew laughs)

38:06.917 --> 38:09.519
That was major league style.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.055
Okay, so, with that in mind,

38:12.057 --> 38:14.391
Go tell your dad
he's doing a good job.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.464
This is working.
Mm.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.633
You know, I-I think

38:23.635 --> 38:26.436
Ralph failed his test
to better fit in with drew.

38:29.340 --> 38:33.410
He doesn't want him
to go away again.

38:33.412 --> 38:36.079
Yeah, but he can't
deny his genius.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.647
That's who he is.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.716
That's who drew needs
to get to know.

38:44.422 --> 38:46.489
You know, I'll help.

38:53.931 --> 38:56.433
Can I ask you
something... Crazy?

38:57.702 --> 38:58.935
You got plans tonight?

39:00.538 --> 39:02.072
All right,
that was inappropriate.

39:03.341 --> 39:06.476
Are you into drag races?

39:06.478 --> 39:07.944
I actually built
a funny car once.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.479
Great.

39:09.481 --> 39:12.048
There's a rally in pomona.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.783
You know what? I am.

39:13.785 --> 39:14.951
You want to go?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.586
Yeah. Why not?

39:16.588 --> 39:17.654
Nice.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.389
Okay, well...

39:19.391 --> 39:21.458
Enjoy your billions.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.829
I was angry
when I wrote this program.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.831
And I didn't want
anything to do with music.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.667
But now I think
I just don't want anything

39:30.669 --> 39:32.068
To do with bad music.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.003
I don't want to be a fake.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.672
Reid didn't want me
living scared.

39:37.475 --> 39:39.442
All these years, I could've
been doing something great.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.378
It's better late than never.

39:43.514 --> 39:44.781
You're right.

39:44.783 --> 39:48.585
You are so... Right,

39:48.587 --> 39:50.153
Happy.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.888
So right!

39:56.994 --> 39:58.862
Hey.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.098
How can I repay you, man?

40:02.100 --> 40:05.935
Whoa, well, I got you,
um, drugged,

40:05.937 --> 40:07.470
Kidnapped, almost blown up.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.706
So I-I think we're even. Yeah.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.875
Unless you got a spare
lambo lying around.

40:11.877 --> 40:15.178
Well, you're gonna need
lucky the king money for that.

40:17.515 --> 40:18.815
Thanks, man.
Yeah, sure.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.884
You, too.

40:23.487 --> 40:25.088
Think I can borrow
lucky the king's car?

40:25.090 --> 40:28.691
Sylvester:
Not unless you've got
something he wants.

40:30.728 --> 40:32.862
Router speed is ten
times what it was.

40:46.211 --> 40:49.979
