01:07.035 --> 01:11.713
Shoot. I am ordering you to shoot!

01:26.785 --> 01:29.842
You missed!

01:34.078 --> 01:36.728
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

01:43.527 --> 01:46.844
_

02:04.602 --> 02:08.151
We have all night, so brace yourselves.

02:10.084 --> 02:14.140
Nice!

02:21.917 --> 02:24.377
Wooh!

02:40.573 --> 02:43.165
Hard to believe that
they elected that bugger.

02:43.407 --> 02:45.552
- Sir?
- Frank Williams.

02:45.672 --> 02:48.232
Not the most honorable
man from what I hear.

02:48.233 --> 02:50.452
I wouldn't trust him as
far as I could throw him.

02:50.765 --> 02:52.459
In fact I did throw him once,

02:52.466 --> 02:54.491
many years ago when I
was still a constable.

02:54.520 --> 02:57.832
- Nearly lost my bloody job over it.
- What happened?

02:57.862 --> 03:00.518
He robbed a shop. His
father made it go away.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.728
Twenty years later, he's
running City Council.

03:04.379 --> 03:06.784
- We shall persevere.
- Indeed.

03:06.904 --> 03:09.218
And now onto more pressing matters.

03:09.338 --> 03:10.776
Any news on Mr. Dobbs?

03:10.806 --> 03:14.297
Well, sir, at this point Mr. Dobbs
has been missing for three days.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.224
Ugh. Bloody socialist.

03:16.427 --> 03:18.456
Likely planning sedition somewhere.

03:19.017 --> 03:20.568
As far as I know, sir,

03:20.622 --> 03:23.051
he was merely asking for
fair working conditions.

03:23.057 --> 03:25.635
I know that, Murdoch. I can
hardly say that I blame him.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.605
Not the way these bloody developers

03:27.629 --> 03:29.162
are stiffing the working man.

03:29.497 --> 03:31.968
Oh, Murdoch, are you and
the missus free for dinner?

03:31.997 --> 03:35.297
- Margaret was wondering.
- Sir, Julia is in Chicago for the next few days.

03:35.339 --> 03:36.938
But upon her return...

03:37.027 --> 03:39.855
Ah, so you're on your own
tomcatting around! Ha ha!

03:39.855 --> 03:41.562
Make sure you stay out of bother.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.134
Sir, telephone call for you.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.099
- She says it's important.
- Right. Sir.

03:51.652 --> 03:55.209
Remind me again who you work for?

03:57.915 --> 04:00.649
You work for the City of Toronto.

04:00.882 --> 04:03.018
I also work for law and order.

04:03.317 --> 04:04.761
One and the same.

04:05.137 --> 04:06.778
And even if you disagree,

04:06.790 --> 04:09.404
that does little to change
the fact that a policeman,

04:09.410 --> 04:12.659
in your employ, is wanted for murder.

04:12.779 --> 04:15.114
And you're doing
nothing to apprehend him.

04:15.234 --> 04:17.805
Murdoch didn't kill
anyone. It's just absurd.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.927
It is what the evidence says.

04:21.047 --> 04:24.545
Evidence can easily be manipulated
to make it look how you want.

04:26.159 --> 04:28.155
I don't like what you're suggesting.

04:28.165 --> 04:29.707
I know William Murdoch.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.004
I know what he was looking into.

04:32.625 --> 04:33.957
Baseless rumour.

04:34.601 --> 04:35.513
But...

04:36.005 --> 04:38.983
I don't begrudge you your feelings
of loyalty toward your men.

04:39.489 --> 04:40.892
Even I've been willing to

04:40.954 --> 04:43.747
look the other way to help
out a friend from time to time.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.145
Davis.

04:45.265 --> 04:47.446
Good to see you as well, Tom.

04:47.470 --> 04:50.368
And it's Chief Constable Davis again.

04:50.378 --> 04:52.087
Get out of my station, Davis.

04:52.140 --> 04:53.644
I'm the one who's in charge around here.

04:53.644 --> 04:55.453
From this moment heretofore,

04:55.573 --> 04:58.771
Chief Constable Davis will be
leading the manhunt for your...

04:58.891 --> 05:01.392
Detective Murdoch.

05:01.512 --> 05:03.531
Chief Constable Davis. She's here.

05:03.545 --> 05:06.506
- Who's she, Higgins?
- He was talking to me, Tom.

05:06.912 --> 05:09.313
Oh Tom, I'll be using
your interview room.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.399
I trust you won't interrupt.

05:14.224 --> 05:15.585
Where is your husband?

05:17.361 --> 05:18.736
I don't know.

05:19.347 --> 05:21.795
Oh come on now, he is your husband.

05:21.819 --> 05:23.667
You must keep tabs on him.

05:24.670 --> 05:27.319
I certainly don't "keep
tabs" on my husband.

05:27.539 --> 05:32.338
Well, considering the
circumstances of his disappearance,

05:32.458 --> 05:34.039
perhaps you should.

05:35.507 --> 05:36.581
Where is he?

05:37.410 --> 05:38.873
I don't know.

05:39.416 --> 05:42.561
I was in Chicago at a
conference when he went missing.

05:43.015 --> 05:45.020
This would be the same time

05:45.140 --> 05:47.931
the dead woman was found
in your husband's bed.

05:49.727 --> 05:52.114
And I'm sure there's
an explanation for that.

05:52.526 --> 05:53.892
Of course there is.

05:54.238 --> 05:56.691
A burlesque dancer found
dead in a man's bed?

05:56.697 --> 05:58.266
I can think of a few.

05:59.287 --> 06:01.698
I doubt my husband
would ever be unfaithful.

06:02.545 --> 06:04.681
Actually I... I know
that he would never...

06:04.705 --> 06:06.836
What was his connection with her?

06:08.195 --> 06:09.742
I wasn't aware of any.

06:10.356 --> 06:13.041
You're not aware of much, are you?

06:13.728 --> 06:16.783
But I suppose that should
come as no surprise.

06:17.923 --> 06:20.883
It's been my experience
that very few wives

06:20.918 --> 06:24.869
are aware of what their husbands
play at when they are away.

06:26.875 --> 06:30.120
_

06:30.371 --> 06:31.880
This is absurd.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.770
- We should be home in our beds.
- Henry's right.

06:34.836 --> 06:38.196
But instead we're out here
looking for Detective Murdoch.

06:38.261 --> 06:40.976
- He's no murderer.
- You don't think I know that, Jackson?

06:41.024 --> 06:42.724
Then what are we doing
out here looking for him?

06:42.748 --> 06:43.894
Orders.

06:43.983 --> 06:46.363
You mean to tell me that, if
you found Detective Murdoch,

06:46.375 --> 06:47.704
George, you'd arrest him?

08:07.304 --> 08:09.485
_

08:09.605 --> 08:10.917
What did you see?

08:13.019 --> 08:15.429
It was shortly after my performance.

08:15.697 --> 08:17.606
Enjoying your party?

08:18.852 --> 08:20.146
Very much so.

08:20.356 --> 08:22.055
Just remember who put you here.

08:23.435 --> 08:25.478
- I remember.
- Good.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.316
Is it done?

08:29.591 --> 08:30.771
Melinda Street?

08:30.999 --> 08:32.986
I filed the applications this morning.

08:33.172 --> 08:35.486
So, most of the street is mine.

08:35.539 --> 08:37.964
And you are now a rich man.

08:38.599 --> 08:40.289
A good day all around.

08:40.609 --> 08:41.994
And jail time...

08:42.114 --> 08:43.698
if we're both found out.

08:43.938 --> 08:47.567
There is little reward...
without risk, Franklin.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.322
- Well, I should get back to the party.
- One more thing.

08:53.379 --> 08:55.217
I need you to take care of Dobbs.

08:56.964 --> 08:58.229
Who's that?!

09:19.864 --> 09:20.766
Gents.

09:20.886 --> 09:22.981
He says there's an intruder
inside the building.

09:23.177 --> 09:24.432
He'll have to call somebody else.

09:24.447 --> 09:25.860
We're looking for
Detective Murdoch right now.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.321
That's the thing of it, George.

09:27.469 --> 09:29.717
He says the intruder
is Detective Murdoch.

09:31.197 --> 09:32.743
Oh God.

09:50.217 --> 09:52.165
- Sir.
- George.

09:53.411 --> 09:55.115
You're not supposed to be in here, sir.

09:57.384 --> 09:58.701
I can leave.

09:58.887 --> 10:00.387
I can't let you do that.

10:01.389 --> 10:02.559
George, no.

10:02.617 --> 10:04.154
Sir, it's for the best.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.227
- I can't.
- Sir, you're wanted for murder.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.736
You don't really
believe that to be true,

10:09.760 --> 10:11.626
- do you?
- No, of course not, but come in with us.

10:11.664 --> 10:13.760
We'll work together,
we'll clear your name.

10:13.922 --> 10:15.312
You won't be able to.

10:15.432 --> 10:17.398
I won't be able to, not behind bars.

10:17.436 --> 10:20.988
- Sir, I can't let you leave.
- George. Please.

10:21.164 --> 10:24.061
Tell Julia that you saw
me and that I'm fine.

10:25.131 --> 10:27.086
You can tell her yourself. Lads.

10:27.122 --> 10:29.409
I'm sorry, George.

10:31.752 --> 10:34.727
- George! Are you alright, George?
- Where is he?

10:37.497 --> 10:38.867
WHERE IS HE?!

10:42.771 --> 10:43.889
He got away.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.966
Damn it, we're supposed to bring him in!

10:46.086 --> 10:47.800
- George.
- Higgins, he's safer

10:47.824 --> 10:49.361
with us than without us.

10:54.916 --> 10:57.552
- This doesn't help us, Crabtree, none of it.
- Sir.

10:58.416 --> 11:01.071
I didn't let him go. He escaped.

11:01.839 --> 11:03.429
I'm sorry, Doctor Ogden.

11:03.486 --> 11:05.997
That may be, but no one else
is going to see it that way.

11:06.016 --> 11:07.830
As far as the Board of
Control are concerned,

11:07.849 --> 11:10.604
- we're aiding and abetting a criminal.
- A criminal?

11:10.639 --> 11:12.699
Do you realize how ridiculous you sound?

11:12.737 --> 11:14.404
The fact of the matter
is that right now,

11:14.413 --> 11:16.476
your husband has no friends except us.

11:16.524 --> 11:18.524
And the only friends that
we have are each other.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.523
Right, then. If they're
after the Detective

11:21.537 --> 11:23.274
it's because they think
he knows something.

11:23.547 --> 11:25.872
And they want him to
go to the grave with it.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.303
That's the truth of it, isn't it?

11:31.092 --> 11:33.362
They'd rather see him dead than alive.

11:34.623 --> 11:36.585
If he does get in contact you, Doctor...

11:36.614 --> 11:37.969
You'll know!

11:38.027 --> 11:40.366
No harm will come to
him, Doctor, I promise.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.404
Thank you, George.

11:44.686 --> 11:47.192
Inspector. What was he
doing with that woman?

11:47.312 --> 11:49.909
- I don't know.
- And why was she in our home?

11:49.990 --> 11:52.105
All Murdoch would say is
that she was a witness.

11:52.124 --> 11:53.613
A witness to what?

11:54.243 --> 11:55.380
I don't know.

12:03.528 --> 12:04.640
Nina.

12:14.521 --> 12:16.407
Tell me about Lydia and William.

12:17.123 --> 12:18.684
I don't know anything.

12:20.547 --> 12:21.998
I'm a grown woman.

12:22.292 --> 12:24.505
My husband is in danger, so tell me.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.607
I saw them together.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.692
Together?

12:32.110 --> 12:33.584
What do you mean, "together"?

12:40.615 --> 12:42.344
They were just talking.

12:43.002 --> 12:44.343
About what?

12:44.935 --> 12:46.189
I don't know.

12:47.236 --> 12:49.256
I heard that Lydia was
a witness to something.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.009
- What did she see?
- I don't know.

12:51.854 --> 12:55.464
- She wouldn't tell me.
- Nina, you must know something.

12:57.535 --> 12:59.688
Lydia was at a private party.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.985
Sometimes we're called to attend them.

13:03.031 --> 13:04.486
Some of the girls go.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.171
Who was there?

13:06.525 --> 13:10.069
Construction bigwigs,
politicians, those sorts of people.

13:12.043 --> 13:14.284
All she would tell me is
that she heard something

13:14.293 --> 13:15.790
that she never should have heard.

13:17.544 --> 13:20.444
- But you have no clue...
- Nothing at all.

13:21.322 --> 13:24.353
But it must have been something...

13:25.856 --> 13:29.593
'cause a couple of days later,
two men came here looking for her.

13:30.053 --> 13:31.641
But she was gone.

13:32.074 --> 13:34.725
I never saw her again.

13:38.002 --> 13:39.655
I'm sorry.

13:40.976 --> 13:42.479
I know.

13:43.013 --> 13:45.624
I do hope you find your husband.

13:45.675 --> 13:48.259
He's a good and decent man.

13:48.925 --> 13:50.561
I know.

13:50.859 --> 13:52.817
I will.

13:54.389 --> 13:56.536
She was my friend.

13:58.830 --> 14:01.627
She was so funny.

14:06.288 --> 14:09.336
And the city of Toronto
is indeed fortunate

14:09.646 --> 14:12.418
to have the talents and acumen

14:12.613 --> 14:14.502
of Mr. Robert Graham.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.842
Whose new development on this very site

14:17.906 --> 14:21.190
- will be this city's shining jewel.
- Hear! Hear!

14:21.310 --> 14:23.977
Bravo! Well said!

14:24.907 --> 14:28.006
Now Robert, would you
care to say a few words?

14:33.774 --> 14:36.145
Thank you, Counselor Williams.

14:36.782 --> 14:39.009
I am honoured to be entrusted with

14:39.043 --> 14:42.318
rebuilding this small
part of our beloved city.

14:42.806 --> 14:46.968
The Great Fire was a tragedy
that has left an ugly scar.

14:47.209 --> 14:51.319
But with destruction we
have a chance at rebirth.

14:51.686 --> 14:55.073
This city will rise from the ashes

14:55.285 --> 14:58.930
and turn into something more
beautiful than she ever was.

14:59.050 --> 15:03.859
And, as I have assured my good
friend, Counselor Williams,

15:03.979 --> 15:06.838
this flight will be on time

15:06.901 --> 15:10.603
and under budget.

15:11.194 --> 15:13.117
Thank you.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.192
My life is in danger.

15:18.139 --> 15:20.969
I just want to get out of
here, out of town, anywhere.

15:21.876 --> 15:23.205
Who's after you?

15:24.166 --> 15:25.348
Two men.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.478
I've seen them, and they've seen me.

15:27.598 --> 15:29.400
Why are they after you?

15:32.259 --> 15:35.517
I can't help you if you
don't tell me anything.

15:36.513 --> 15:38.820
I was working a party,

15:39.378 --> 15:41.966
and I overheard two men speaking.

15:41.978 --> 15:43.763
It sounded like they were up to no good.

15:44.285 --> 15:45.858
What were they talking about?

15:45.978 --> 15:49.209
Some building on Melinda Street,
how they were going to get rich.

15:49.422 --> 15:51.069
And who were the two men?

15:51.901 --> 15:54.295
One of them was Mr. Williams,

15:54.507 --> 15:56.321
the man in the paper.

15:57.763 --> 15:59.048
And the other?

16:00.541 --> 16:02.395
A man named Graham.

16:05.088 --> 16:06.748
Did you hear anything else?

16:08.055 --> 16:09.417
Um...

16:11.787 --> 16:14.282
They mentioned a man named Dobbs.

16:14.402 --> 16:17.032
- Edward Dobbs?
- I don't know.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.890
I think so.

16:24.493 --> 16:26.516
This beautiful dress...

16:27.890 --> 16:29.838
I had it made just for the party.

16:31.807 --> 16:33.997
And now it's ruined.

16:35.191 --> 16:38.113
It's alright, Miss Hall, it's alright.

16:46.655 --> 16:48.246
Williams was one of them, sir.

16:48.286 --> 16:50.209
Our new boss! Well isn't
that bloody wonderful!

16:50.226 --> 16:53.073
- I'm going to investigate.
- Investigate what?

16:53.130 --> 16:54.978
It's a crooked land deal.
What's to investigate?

16:55.018 --> 16:56.898
Are you suggesting I look the other way?

16:57.143 --> 17:00.032
I'm suggesting that if you look
into all the deals the city makes,

17:00.041 --> 17:02.233
you're going to find hundreds
of similar arrangements.

17:02.353 --> 17:04.586
- There's one more thing, sir.
- Of course there is.

17:04.603 --> 17:06.371
- Edward Dobbs.
- Oh, bullocks.

17:06.382 --> 17:08.317
The man has been missing for three days.

17:08.339 --> 17:11.479
This could be more than politics
as usual. This could be murder.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.522
No one will believe a word of it.

17:13.643 --> 17:15.790
Your only source is nothing
more than a dance hall girl.

17:15.808 --> 17:18.064
- No one's gonna take her seriously.
- I am.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.209
You're not the average man, Murdoch.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.223
I'm going to speak to Dobbs' wife.

17:22.258 --> 17:25.041
I doubt she'll add much
to the mix, but go ahead!

17:33.194 --> 17:35.402
- Mrs. Dobbs...
- Just get away from me.

17:35.412 --> 17:38.153
I have nothing to say to you.
Or any police, for that matter.

17:38.166 --> 17:41.468
- I just have a couple of questions.
- I don't know where he is.

17:41.588 --> 17:43.667
That's exactly what I'd
like to help you with.

17:43.713 --> 17:45.233
Help... me.

17:45.605 --> 17:47.038
I doubt that.

17:47.442 --> 17:50.352
Your type never helps people
like us. You're just lackeys.

17:50.386 --> 17:52.268
I can assure you that I am not.

17:52.388 --> 17:54.356
- Now if your husband is missing...
- If?

17:54.739 --> 17:57.043
He hasn't been here in three days.

17:57.099 --> 17:58.860
There is no "if" about it.

17:59.524 --> 18:01.695
Someone has killed him.

18:02.609 --> 18:03.738
Or taken him.

18:04.703 --> 18:08.763
They tarred and feathered a union
man in Colorado, not long ago.

18:08.786 --> 18:10.650
They'll do worse to Edward.

18:10.677 --> 18:13.001
Who would do worse to him?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.014
Robert Graham.

18:16.817 --> 18:19.783
Edward had called for a
strike against his company.

18:19.783 --> 18:21.707
He was having some success.

18:22.070 --> 18:24.172
If someone has hurt Edward...

18:24.292 --> 18:26.495
... Graham had something to do with it.

18:31.648 --> 18:33.495
I'd like to question Mr. Graham.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.597
- No.
- No?

18:35.631 --> 18:36.998
Graham's an untouchable.

18:37.118 --> 18:38.578
He holds the secrets of almost

18:38.592 --> 18:40.470
every elected city
official in his hands.

18:40.493 --> 18:43.313
Sir, he may be responsible
for a man's disappearance.

18:43.433 --> 18:46.477
A man no one cares about. A
socialist and a rabble rouser.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.077
A man nevertheless!

18:49.111 --> 18:51.266
If you want to go after
Williams and Graham,

18:51.280 --> 18:53.310
you're going to need more than
the words of a dance-hall girl

18:53.319 --> 18:55.491
and a socialist's wife.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.663
Detective Murdoch.

18:59.725 --> 19:01.061
I'll be right there.

19:02.861 --> 19:04.292
Edward Dobbs.

19:04.326 --> 19:06.327
They pulled him out
of the lake yesterday.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.051
He'd been in there three days.

19:08.764 --> 19:10.543
But, take a look at this.

19:10.874 --> 19:12.600
He was obviously strangled.

19:13.289 --> 19:14.951
His wife's worst fear.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.105
And nothing I can use.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.613
Let me know if you find anything else.

19:23.847 --> 19:24.981
Chicago.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.891
You do remember?

19:27.011 --> 19:28.526
I'm off this evening.

19:29.123 --> 19:31.396
Ah yes, yes, right.

19:31.626 --> 19:33.384
- Right, of course.
- I'm so happy

19:33.416 --> 19:36.047
that my comings and goings still
leave such an impression on you.

19:48.456 --> 19:50.753
Mr. Graham. Have a seat.

19:50.822 --> 19:53.517
- I'd prefer to stand.
- Very well.

19:54.298 --> 19:57.979
A man in your employ is
lying dead in our morgue.

19:58.325 --> 19:59.363
That's a shame.

19:59.836 --> 20:01.907
It's an Edward Dobbs...

20:01.934 --> 20:03.027
do you know him?

20:03.257 --> 20:06.374
I have over a thousand men
working for me at present.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.142
Yes.

20:08.368 --> 20:11.472
But only one man who was
leading a potential strike action

20:11.486 --> 20:14.292
- against your company.
- It's a democracy,

20:14.412 --> 20:15.862
that's within his right.

20:16.432 --> 20:18.047
I believe he was murdered.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.125
And since I'm in here
I suppose you believe

20:21.148 --> 20:22.833
I had something to do with it?

20:23.871 --> 20:25.955
Would you like to clear your conscience?

20:26.365 --> 20:27.977
I have no need to.

20:28.835 --> 20:30.190
Are you sure?

20:31.861 --> 20:34.295
So now that you've put me on notice,

20:34.332 --> 20:35.994
am I free to go?

20:37.849 --> 20:39.351
For now, Mr. Graham.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.077
For now.

20:41.739 --> 20:43.218
Thank you.

20:54.771 --> 20:57.558
I just want to go out of town.

20:57.678 --> 20:59.533
You can't leave yet. I still need you.

20:59.547 --> 21:00.668
For what?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.818
If what you told me is true,

21:02.822 --> 21:04.921
I need your help to take down Williams.

21:07.005 --> 21:09.182
- Why bother?
- You can't...

21:09.187 --> 21:12.157
- They are going to kill me!
- They won't.

21:13.044 --> 21:15.537
They won't. I'll protect you.

21:16.230 --> 21:18.761
- Please.
- I doubt that.

21:20.395 --> 21:22.540
Especially after what I saw.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.265
You told me you just
saw two men arguing.

21:29.015 --> 21:30.371
Yes, that's right.

21:32.738 --> 21:34.543
- You're lying.
- I am not!

21:34.616 --> 21:36.191
You saw something more.

21:36.678 --> 21:39.512
You saw something that
scared you. What was it?

21:40.347 --> 21:43.048
- What was it?!
- I don't want to end up like Mr. Dobbs!

21:45.184 --> 21:46.921
What happened to Mr. Dobbs?

21:50.251 --> 21:52.030
I saw more than I said.

21:55.464 --> 21:57.559
Well, I should get back to the party.

21:57.593 --> 21:59.292
One more thing.

22:06.288 --> 22:08.643
I need you to take care of Dobbs.

22:17.263 --> 22:18.681
So do it.

22:20.036 --> 22:22.481
- Are you crazy?
- Far from it.

22:24.713 --> 22:26.768
I... I... I can't.

22:28.054 --> 22:31.218
This man here... he's our new enemy.

22:31.338 --> 22:34.135
A worker who thinks
he is more than he is.

22:34.380 --> 22:38.387
A member of the rabble who
thinks he is above politics.

22:41.039 --> 22:42.153
But I...

22:42.205 --> 22:45.614
I say the word and the
world knows you're a crook.

22:46.377 --> 22:49.867
You do this for me and
you're rich forever.

23:22.384 --> 23:24.121
I didn't help.

23:25.378 --> 23:27.803
I didn't do anything, I just...

23:28.104 --> 23:30.313
I just watched that man die

23:30.326 --> 23:32.776
- before my eyes.
- Alright...

23:32.804 --> 23:35.674
NO!!

23:50.412 --> 23:52.939
Toronto Constabulary!

23:52.962 --> 23:54.213
Open up!

23:56.664 --> 23:58.184
Open up, Murdoch!

23:58.202 --> 24:00.779
- (more knocking)
- I SAID OPEN THE DOOR!!

24:02.787 --> 24:04.592
GET AFTER HIM!!

24:12.207 --> 24:14.769
Chief Constable Davis,
what in God's name is this?

24:14.803 --> 24:17.872
You can't read? On your feet, Constable.

24:18.245 --> 24:21.206
- Detective Murdoch could nev...
- A young woman

24:21.229 --> 24:23.697
was found dead in your
Detective Murdoch's bed.

24:23.732 --> 24:25.511
He ran from the Constabulary.

24:25.528 --> 24:28.282
- He certainly could...
- Davis, I think this is ludicrous.

24:28.317 --> 24:29.799
I don't want you to think.

24:29.857 --> 24:32.623
I want you to do your job and
bring Detective Murdoch in.

24:32.646 --> 24:35.947
Alive, preferably, but
I'll accept the other.

24:36.067 --> 24:38.909
If Murdoch ran, it's
because he had good reason.

24:38.926 --> 24:40.516
He certainly did.

24:40.636 --> 24:42.433
Guilt!

24:44.878 --> 24:46.531
Arm yourself, Inspector.

24:46.583 --> 24:48.460
We're going out looking for your man.

25:46.056 --> 25:47.520
Sir.

25:48.220 --> 25:49.506
George.

25:52.042 --> 25:53.976
You're not going to
hit me again, are you?

25:54.327 --> 25:56.018
No, George, I'm not.

25:56.456 --> 25:59.739
The only reason you connected is
because I truly wasn't expecting it.

26:00.042 --> 26:01.496
Of course.

26:02.044 --> 26:03.998
What do you need me for, sir?

26:04.847 --> 26:06.862
George you must know I had nothing to do

26:06.885 --> 26:08.871
- with Lydia Hall's murder.
- Of course not.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.272
You hardly need mention it.

26:10.743 --> 26:13.635
But the fact of the matter is Chief
Constable Davis is out for blood.

26:13.659 --> 26:16.110
- Don't you think you're better off coming with us?
- No, I don't.

26:17.114 --> 26:19.341
But there is something that
you could do for me, George.

26:19.605 --> 26:21.534
I need you to find out all you can

26:21.563 --> 26:23.600
about Frank Williams and Robert Graham.

26:23.652 --> 26:25.287
They're the ones after you?

26:25.683 --> 26:29.030
- It would appear so.
- Sir, that's not...

26:29.277 --> 26:31.905
- that's not good news.
- I'm aware of that, George.

26:31.928 --> 26:35.113
I also need you to speak
with your... reporter friend.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.462
- Sir?
- At this point

26:36.473 --> 26:38.637
I don't think anyone
in the Constabulary,

26:38.706 --> 26:41.237
or City Hall for that
matter, can help me.

26:41.759 --> 26:44.682
See needs to find where
the skeletons are buried.

26:46.995 --> 26:48.756
I'll see what I can do.

26:49.056 --> 26:52.403
If you find anything, leave
it here. I'll check back.

26:53.149 --> 26:54.369
Sir, I think we should be doing this

26:54.372 --> 26:55.933
- through the normal channels.
- George,

26:56.404 --> 26:59.348
there are no normal channels anymore.

27:02.850 --> 27:04.186
Sir.

27:04.306 --> 27:06.466
You get out of here.
I'll take care of them.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.579
No sign of him, lads.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.961
What Station House are you boys from?

27:15.024 --> 27:16.565
I see you're looking for...

27:16.585 --> 27:19.230
Get your... HEY!! HEY!!

27:29.189 --> 27:30.779
Get out.

27:33.684 --> 27:35.802
I won't say it twice.

27:46.576 --> 27:51.243
First, let me say I understand
the chain of command.

27:51.974 --> 27:56.291
I understand loyalty to a superior
officer and, most importantly,

27:56.302 --> 27:59.551
I understand loyalty to a friend.

28:00.481 --> 28:03.155
Your Detective Murdoch is a lucky man.

28:04.608 --> 28:07.259
I don't see much lucky
about his situation.

28:07.793 --> 28:10.026
Ah, well, he put himself there.

28:10.595 --> 28:12.368
I highly doubt that.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.601
Well, I'm not interested
in your opinion.

28:16.456 --> 28:19.305
What you need be concerned
with is your record.

28:19.837 --> 28:21.943
You have spent time in jail,

28:21.984 --> 28:25.921
your career is limited as it is.
If you don't cooperate with me,

28:26.041 --> 28:28.309
your career is over.

28:31.017 --> 28:32.734
I don't give a damn.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.231
Well I do.

28:35.426 --> 28:37.561
And I want answers.

28:40.448 --> 28:43.462
Now I know you two have
been staying in contact

28:43.463 --> 28:45.831
and I want you to bring him in.

28:46.486 --> 28:49.015
I won't do it.

28:49.064 --> 28:51.715
- AAH!!
- Answer me!

28:52.005 --> 28:53.972
- Give me the right answer!
- GET OFF HIM, DAVIS!!

28:53.974 --> 28:55.808
- BACK OFF!!
- Stay away from my man.

28:55.842 --> 28:58.994
- I'm your superior.
- I don't give a toss. Crabtree, get out.

28:59.057 --> 29:00.212
NOW!

29:02.449 --> 29:04.693
I've handled better
than you with a hangover.

29:04.985 --> 29:06.863
Don't even think about it.

29:11.989 --> 29:13.940
Get used to it, Davis.

29:14.130 --> 29:16.586
You'll be back in here soon enough.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.542
Here, get that down ya.

29:25.506 --> 29:27.840
What did Murdoch say?
Has he gotten anywhere?

29:27.874 --> 29:29.808
He wants me to look into Robert Graham.

29:29.843 --> 29:31.475
You won't find anything.

29:32.060 --> 29:34.271
- Does he know who killed Lydia?
- No. But it's clear

29:34.294 --> 29:35.671
they're trying to make it look like him.

29:35.976 --> 29:38.892
Surely sir, there's not a judge
in the city who would believe that?

29:39.138 --> 29:41.141
I mean, it's William Murdoch.

29:41.548 --> 29:44.402
They'll take him into custody,
he won't even stand trial.

29:44.941 --> 29:46.938
Murdoch will end up a
Catholic wracked with guilt

29:46.938 --> 29:49.097
searching for salvation
at the end of a noose.

29:50.072 --> 29:51.634
My God.

29:52.489 --> 29:53.982
So what do we do?

29:54.102 --> 29:56.769
We help him without
being seen to help him.

29:57.477 --> 29:58.637
Constable.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.454
You're back on active duty.

30:00.479 --> 30:01.925
But watch yourself.

30:02.557 --> 30:04.830
You best tell Murdoch to surrender,

30:05.011 --> 30:07.493
or there truly will be hell to pay.

30:46.294 --> 30:48.988
Louise. I need you to get me something.

30:49.022 --> 30:50.651
A new suit.

30:51.466 --> 30:54.260
No. I need you to get me
any information you can

30:54.484 --> 30:57.096
on Franklin Williams and Robert Graham.

30:57.526 --> 31:00.466
They're public figures.
They're well known.

31:00.665 --> 31:03.569
I need to know what they get up
to when they're not in public.

31:05.894 --> 31:08.902
- I'm not sure.
- Louise, Detective Murdoch is my friend,

31:09.160 --> 31:10.709
he needs my help.

31:10.963 --> 31:13.970
- They're powerful men, George.
- And Detective Murdoch is a good man

31:13.976 --> 31:15.948
who's been accused of a
crime he didn't commit.

31:17.403 --> 31:18.851
I'll look into it.

31:22.494 --> 31:25.312
Thank you. George, I have to go.

31:44.351 --> 31:47.163
_

31:50.607 --> 31:52.184
Thank you for coming, George.

31:52.218 --> 31:53.976
I wasn't sure you'd be here, sir.

31:54.045 --> 31:56.828
They'd never expect us to
meet in the same place twice.

31:56.856 --> 32:00.002
- Any news on Julia?
- Only that she's been taken.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.385
They're trying to force me out.

32:02.729 --> 32:04.363
It might be the best thing to do, sir.

32:05.031 --> 32:06.483
Not yet.

32:07.803 --> 32:09.435
Meet me here again tomorrow.

32:09.669 --> 32:11.144
Alright.

32:34.373 --> 32:36.353
You said you would keep me safe.

32:36.362 --> 32:38.345
You should have protected me.

32:41.868 --> 32:44.440
William Murdoch,

32:44.503 --> 32:46.414
you are under arrest.

33:00.994 --> 33:02.463
Go and put the kettle on.

33:04.415 --> 33:06.759
If you'd have asked for
help, you wouldn't be here.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.863
You really believe that?

33:09.763 --> 33:11.583
Does this looks like it?

33:14.798 --> 33:17.984
- Go on, get out.
- They'll know you did this.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.739
Go get what you need
on whoever's framing ya.

33:20.774 --> 33:22.443
I'll find your wife.

33:25.845 --> 33:27.592
Thank you, sir.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.772
COME ON, THEN! (groans and grunts)

33:46.752 --> 33:49.650
Ah! Ah!

34:04.390 --> 34:06.300
I'll expect you out now.

34:07.006 --> 34:09.083
You can't say that you weren't warned.

34:09.498 --> 34:11.701
Cat got your tongue, Brackenreid?

34:11.735 --> 34:13.882
I've been on the job
twenty years, Davis.

34:14.002 --> 34:15.610
There's nothing you can do to stop me.

34:15.634 --> 34:17.826
You heard him. You're finished.

34:18.802 --> 34:20.610
I may be finished with the job.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.641
Doesn't mean I'm finished with you.

34:24.047 --> 34:25.632
Leave it, Davis.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.949
Station Four is done.

34:29.237 --> 34:31.166
The only person that
Murdoch has on his side

34:31.206 --> 34:33.094
is that little imbecile.

34:33.428 --> 34:36.292
I've got men on him, but
I doubt he's good for much.

34:37.032 --> 34:39.994
Listen, you know the two
that are glued to Williams.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.280
- Right.
- Well, I'm on to them.

34:41.326 --> 34:43.708
And I'm not in uniform.
If Williams is involved

34:43.719 --> 34:45.120
in Dr. Ogden's disappearance,

34:45.166 --> 34:48.081
- then they've got something to do with it.
- Watch yourself, sir.

34:48.799 --> 34:51.755
I've lost my job and my best
man, it's too late for that.

34:52.134 --> 34:55.004
It's up to us to make this
right, Crabtree. You and me.

34:58.182 --> 35:00.624
Paper!

35:03.006 --> 35:04.854
I asked you to look into those two.

35:04.877 --> 35:06.576
- I was, but...
- Instead you wrote an article

35:06.605 --> 35:08.981
all but accusing Detective
Murdoch of murdering a woman and...

35:09.004 --> 35:12.396
- abducting his wife. Why?
- Because that was the story.

35:12.568 --> 35:14.445
Who told you Doctor
Ogden had been taken?

35:14.565 --> 35:16.661
I received my report from
Chief Constable Davis.

35:16.696 --> 35:18.819
Davis. And what do you
know that's not in here?

35:18.819 --> 35:20.805
- Is she still alive?
- I don't know that, George.

35:20.822 --> 35:23.032
You don't know. You know Davis
is a part of this, don't you?

35:23.044 --> 35:24.949
- George, you're being ridicu...
- Davis is a part of it,

35:24.990 --> 35:26.907
and so is Williams, and so is Graham.

35:26.919 --> 35:30.759
- They're civic-minded men. Good citizens.
- That is a lie and you know it.

35:31.017 --> 35:32.762
Get your hand off me.

35:33.830 --> 35:35.454
I don't see much of a future for us

35:35.488 --> 35:37.107
if you continue to act this way.

35:37.405 --> 35:39.264
Now, I know you're fond
of Detective Murdoch

35:39.287 --> 35:41.681
but, it's clear that he's not
the man you thought he was.

35:41.721 --> 35:44.184
Well, it's clear that you're
not the woman I thought you were.

35:46.663 --> 35:48.564
I was just doing my job.

35:51.853 --> 35:53.208
HELP!

35:53.833 --> 35:55.498
LET ME OUT!

35:55.957 --> 35:57.628
Somebody!

36:08.130 --> 36:10.059
I don't know anything.

36:10.581 --> 36:13.422
I told the Detective and
his wife all that I know.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.216
I can't help you. I would if I could.

36:18.347 --> 36:19.649
I know.

36:21.337 --> 36:23.707
I think I just wanted to see you.

36:32.461 --> 36:34.482
Well, here I am.

36:38.213 --> 36:41.203
I'm so sorry. I never
should have let you go.

36:44.107 --> 36:46.022
You deserve better than me.

36:47.064 --> 36:50.278
I'm only realizing now that
there is no better than you.

36:51.762 --> 36:54.030
But I don't know what to do.

36:54.410 --> 36:56.899
With the Detective and Dr. Ogden gone...

36:58.451 --> 36:59.984
You'll find them.

37:01.338 --> 37:03.382
It's gonna be alright.

37:09.110 --> 37:11.355
That's so touching.

37:12.347 --> 37:13.696
Get out of here.

37:13.816 --> 37:16.130
I would have thought
you'd be out looking.

37:16.888 --> 37:18.834
Or is it that you'd rather spend time

37:18.857 --> 37:20.820
with painted ladies than
look for your Detective?

37:20.940 --> 37:23.506
- Or his missing wife?
- I said get out.

37:23.547 --> 37:25.395
Strike me and you end up in a cell

37:25.418 --> 37:28.207
where you will be even more
useless than you currently are.

37:28.764 --> 37:31.233
But Constable, think about this...

37:31.405 --> 37:33.856
you are at a crossroads in your life.

37:34.413 --> 37:35.865
If you help me,

37:35.985 --> 37:39.010
you will have an
unimpeded rise to the top.

37:39.492 --> 37:41.341
Your Inspector is gone.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.239
Your immediate superior is a murderer.

37:44.779 --> 37:47.591
Things are looking up for
Constable George Crabtree

37:47.935 --> 37:51.139
and all you have to do is look away.

37:52.711 --> 37:54.462
I won't be doing that.

37:56.023 --> 37:58.899
Sounds to me like you
wish to add another item

37:58.968 --> 38:01.913
to your long list of mistakes.

38:05.506 --> 38:07.532
Enjoy your time with your whore.

38:07.768 --> 38:09.460
No.

38:09.638 --> 38:11.096
Don't.

38:13.145 --> 38:15.154
Don't worry, George,

38:15.625 --> 38:17.895
nothing he says will bother me.

38:19.133 --> 38:21.423
The way you just stood up to him...

38:22.066 --> 38:24.517
makes me so proud of you.

38:31.220 --> 38:33.223
Once you have her,
have Fergus and McFadden

38:33.241 --> 38:34.543
take her to the other location.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.138
Davis will be here in half
an hour to clean up the mess.

38:39.767 --> 38:41.793
(grunting) AH!

38:45.983 --> 38:47.918
This would have worked
out a lot better for you

38:47.935 --> 38:49.846
if you hadn't of seen my face.

38:49.909 --> 38:51.327
Get rid of her!

38:51.379 --> 38:54.163
- OUT THE BACK, YOU IDIOT!!
- (muffled screams)

38:56.855 --> 38:59.363
- So you didn't see who left the note?
- No. Why?

38:59.483 --> 39:01.774
- It's from Detective Murdoch.
- What's it say?

39:01.894 --> 39:03.743
He needs our help.

39:13.024 --> 39:14.537
Let's go.

39:22.651 --> 39:25.429
Oh! Motorbike.

39:35.979 --> 39:37.426
Dr. Ogden?!

39:39.555 --> 39:41.105
Doctor?!

39:51.236 --> 39:53.468
You should have stayed retired.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.580
If you've hurt her...

39:55.988 --> 39:57.733
You'll what?

39:59.288 --> 40:00.901
I'll kill you.

40:02.370 --> 40:04.156
I doubt that.

40:11.629 --> 40:13.178
You sure this is the place?

40:13.351 --> 40:15.296
This is where we met last time.

40:15.709 --> 40:18.768
- Then where is he, George?
- I don't know, Jackson.

40:19.044 --> 40:21.696
- (sound of running footsteps)
- DETECTIVE?!

40:24.095 --> 40:26.121
AH!!

40:26.522 --> 40:28.543
- (more shots)
- AH!!

40:28.612 --> 40:32.664
- (more shots)
- AAH!!

40:49.689 --> 40:52.168
No.

40:52.863 --> 40:54.614
No!

40:55.071 --> 40:57.306
Oh my God. George!

40:57.782 --> 41:00.515
No! No!

41:07.856 --> 41:10.840
HELP! HELP! SOMEONE HELP!!

41:12.063 --> 41:14.757
HELP! Out of the way!

41:23.634 --> 41:26.469
Help! Help! Yes! YES!!

41:26.767 --> 41:30.550
This is an emergency! This
is Detective William Murdoch.

41:30.596 --> 41:32.599
Three constables are down.

41:32.662 --> 41:36.376
I need an ambulance at the
church at Yonge and Heath.

41:36.496 --> 41:39.704
Right away! Yes, right away!

41:39.963 --> 41:42.161
You there! I need your assistance.

41:42.281 --> 41:44.222
We'll send someone. You stay with me.

41:44.251 --> 41:47.510
No! No! They need your help!

41:56.390 --> 41:58.095
Where's my wife?

41:59.059 --> 42:01.080
- If you've hurt her...
- You'll what?

42:01.108 --> 42:03.611
Reach through those
bars and throttle me?

42:04.167 --> 42:06.176
And who says I have her?

42:06.245 --> 42:09.051
Or know anything about
what's happened to her?

42:09.104 --> 42:12.707
- WHERE IS SHE?!
- I'll make you a deal.

42:13.106 --> 42:16.458
You sign a confession that
you murdered that strumpet

42:16.493 --> 42:18.854
and I will endeavour to find your wife.

42:19.758 --> 42:21.057
No.

42:21.083 --> 42:25.586
You do not have a lot of
bargaining power, Detective.

42:25.620 --> 42:28.224
Your Inspector is not here for you.

42:28.690 --> 42:31.079
In fact, he may be dead.

42:31.199 --> 42:34.659
Your wife is gone, and if
she is not dead already,

42:34.696 --> 42:37.041
she soon will be.

42:37.371 --> 42:41.245
And I've heard at least one of
your loyal constables is dead.

42:41.636 --> 42:44.953
So, will you sign that confession?

42:45.613 --> 42:47.909
No.

42:51.669 --> 42:55.128
I'm sorry... for you.

43:08.265 --> 43:10.209
Detective Murdoch.

43:10.826 --> 43:13.962
it appears you are
going to need some help.
