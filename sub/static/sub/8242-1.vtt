01:24.200 --> 01:26.931
Haapsalu, comrades! We're arriving!

03:06.840 --> 03:11.289
Many young people would do
anything to Live in a big city.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.751
Like Leningrad.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.390
You didn't like it there?
- No, I didn't.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.077
Why is that?

03:23.240 --> 03:25.880
I've... always preferred
smaller places.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.717
Charming.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.918
You should enjoy
working here then.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.568
Political Economy...

03:40.280 --> 03:42.203
Fencing?

03:43.920 --> 03:47.436
You're still training?
- No. Not anymore.

03:51.560 --> 03:56.248
Not really an activity for the
working man, wouldn't you agree?

04:55.440 --> 04:57.511
Next, please.
- To Leningrad.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.231
Where?
- Leningrad.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.642
Booth number three.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.929
How many minutes?
- Three.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.648
Hello?- Endel?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.757
Endel? Is that you?- Yes.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.883
How've you been?

05:32.040 --> 05:36.432
It's not exactly
what we trained for.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.641
They came looking for you again.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.921
What did you tell them?- That you're training in Saratov.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.640
Listen. Whatever you do, don't stick out.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.235
Do everything as you're told.You hear me?

05:52.280 --> 05:54.681
I hear you.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.710
So how's the job?- School. Kids. What do you think?

05:59.880 --> 06:02.679
You need to focus on
something, otherwise...

06:02.840 --> 06:06.925
On what? There's nothing here!
A dull village. - One minute left.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.289
Endel, listen... Endel!

06:10.440 --> 06:15.913
Time's up. I'll call you later.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.249
Take off with both legs.
Like him.

06:42.400 --> 06:47.156
What was that?
You need to jump!

06:55.360 --> 06:57.317
Comrade Nelis!

06:58.920 --> 07:01.924
I have to remind you
of your additional duties.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.050
You have not started yet?
- I'm sorry, l...

07:05.200 --> 07:08.955
I'd hate to report
that you are coming short.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.350
We don't want that,
do we?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.552
I wish you a pleasant weekend,
Comrade Nelis.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.917
Goodbye, teacher!

08:17.120 --> 08:19.077
Good morning, teacher!
- Hello!

08:21.560 --> 08:24.564
Sports Club.
Skiing on Saturdays.

08:39.480 --> 08:44.600
I hope there'll be some snow, too.
- Yeah...

08:45.880 --> 08:47.803
Me too...

08:49.320 --> 08:51.482
I just wanted to say that...

08:51.640 --> 08:55.281
I'm really glad
you're taking them skiing.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.081
It's a small place,
not that much going on here.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.874
Yeah, of course...
l have to go now.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.710
I'm Kadri, by the way...

09:09.520 --> 09:11.477
Endel.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.407
Good morning!
- Morning, teacher!

10:15.360 --> 10:17.522
Excuse me, could you tell...

10:17.680 --> 10:22.129
Good morning, Comrade Nelis.
What can I do for you?

10:22.280 --> 10:24.681
We are missing
some equipment.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.130
Our skis. I can't find them.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.233
Oh yes! We share
our sports equipment

10:34.400 --> 10:37.643
with the Military Airbase.
Didn't I mention that?

10:39.240 --> 10:44.360
No, you didn't...
- Well, I do now.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.836
Was that everything?
- Yes.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.351
Good!

11:02.200 --> 11:06.171
With all due respect,
how can I run a sports club

11:06.320 --> 11:08.368
without any equipment?

11:08.520 --> 11:13.151
I really don't know.
I couldn't say.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.036
You have the degree
from Leningrad, not me.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.403
Goodbye!

12:54.320 --> 12:56.368
What are you doing?

13:00.640 --> 13:02.950
Practicing.
- What are you practicing?

13:03.160 --> 13:05.470
Fencing.

13:05.640 --> 13:09.611
Is it difficult?
- Yes, it is quite difficult.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.728
Could you teach me, maybe?

13:12.880 --> 13:17.363
I wanted to go to ballet school,
but we don't have one here.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.682
What's your name?
- Marta.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.158
I can't teach you, Marta.
- Why not?

13:27.160 --> 13:29.959
Because there's no point
in fencing alone!

13:37.960 --> 13:41.328
Wait, little girl...
Marta?

13:46.680 --> 13:48.728
Come here for a second.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.362
Take it. It's yours.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.763
Thank you, teacher.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.208
Hello.

14:39.240 --> 14:44.326
All right, let's break it up!
No hanging around in the corridor!

15:07.160 --> 15:09.925
Sports Club.
Fencing on Saturdays.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.041
I want you all to come over here.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.489
Form three... four lines.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.314
Make sure you have
space around you.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.949
Just form four lines.
One behind the other.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.805
My name is Endel Nelis.
Some of you know me already.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.952
Be quiet when I'm talking.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.563
Hands out of your pockets.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.070
I will try to teach you
how to fence.

16:58.240 --> 17:03.838
People usually think it's all
about thrusting and getting hits.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.951
It's not.

17:06.160 --> 17:10.438
The most important thing in fencing
is a precise sense of distance.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.726
This is a foil.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.760
In the old days it was
a deadly weapon used in duels.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.719
One hit and you were dead.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.167
So unless you want
to get killed,

17:30.320 --> 17:34.598
you need to know exactly
where your opponent is.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.969
And you need to move fast.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.282
When I'm talking, you look at me!

17:48.720 --> 17:52.361
I want you to do exactly as I do,
to follow me exactly.

17:52.520 --> 17:56.366
When I move towards you,
you step away.

17:56.520 --> 18:00.798
When I step away, you move
toward me. Understood? - Yes.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.271
On guard!

18:09.880 --> 18:12.190
Right foot forward, left foot back.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.078
And keep your knees bent.
Like this.

18:17.240 --> 18:21.086
As if you were sitting.
Not like this.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.800
And no giggling!

18:23.960 --> 18:27.806
Your right hand in front of you,
this is your weapon hand.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.031
And your left hand like this.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.114
And not like this.
Don't Scratch your ear!

18:44.560 --> 18:48.110
Attention!
All your attention is focused on me.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.637
You're lagging-

19:01.720 --> 19:03.950
And I don't want to hear any noise.

19:04.160 --> 19:08.404
You don't need to rattle.
You move easily and quietly.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.408
Quicker! Move it!

19:22.120 --> 19:25.090
Teacher! Will these do?

19:28.360 --> 19:31.671
Can't make them any longer, can
we?

20:10.280 --> 20:12.749
Do you need any help?
- No.

20:39.320 --> 20:43.166
Keep your distance!
Shoulders down!

20:59.560 --> 21:01.847
Halt!

21:01.960 --> 21:05.396
I don't want to hear any noise
when you move. Look.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.231
Like this.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.834
I'm lifting my feet,
but I'm not stamping.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.635
Got it?
On guard! Go!

21:21.880 --> 21:24.952
Keep your distance!
And where's your hand?

21:31.120 --> 21:33.043
Distance!

21:40.400 --> 21:42.357
Easy! There's no hurry!

21:51.760 --> 21:53.888
...hoping to hear from you soon.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.763
Leningrad...

22:16.640 --> 22:21.931
Come, young man! Good sour cream!
Pickles! - No, thanks.

22:22.080 --> 22:26.711
Good sauerkraut! Made it myself!
Try it! It's vitamins.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.808
And how is it?
- Delicious.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.917
Delicious? Splendid.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.875
So, will you take some?
- No, thanks.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.408
Take some for your girl, too.
- No need. Thank you.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.517
What do you mean, no need?

22:44.280 --> 22:46.351
Hello.
- Hello.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.791
Do you... come here often?

22:52.960 --> 22:56.510
Well, it is the way to...
- School. Yes, of course.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.043
Can I buy you
a cup of hot chocolate?

23:05.600 --> 23:07.762
Hot chocolate?

23:15.200 --> 23:17.874
Sorry, they didn't have
any hot chocolate.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.509
That's all right. Tea is fine.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.484
How do you like the school?
- Fine. Just fine.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.911
I don't like it.

23:43.920 --> 23:48.642
Quite frankly,
I'm not good with children.

23:49.680 --> 23:53.287
I can't get things explained
to them, don't know why...

23:58.600 --> 24:00.967
You just have to be really patient.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.649
And repeat things
over and over again.

24:05.800 --> 24:10.795
They really try, you know,
they're so proud of the fencing.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.363
It's good to have them
focus on something,

24:15.520 --> 24:19.491
keep them occupied.
It takes their mind off things...

24:25.040 --> 24:27.714
If you want to become a fencer...

24:27.880 --> 24:30.315
If you at least want to fence,

24:30.480 --> 24:33.723
you have to try harder,
you have to want it more.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.478
We need to go over
some basics one more time,

24:38.640 --> 24:42.645
because quite a few of you
are not really getting this yet.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.884
This branch is your weapon,

24:47.040 --> 24:50.954
so you need to hold it
as if you were holding a real foil.

24:51.800 --> 24:55.475
You take a firm grip.
But don't squeeze.

24:55.640 --> 25:02.114
Your elbow has to be in line
with the tip of your weapon.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.087
What's your name again?
- Jaan.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.168
Come here, Jaan.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.877
On guard!

25:20.040 --> 25:23.954
Now point at me.
I'm here!

25:24.160 --> 25:27.289
Think of your weapon
as an extension of your arm.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.363
Turn your elbow in.

25:29.520 --> 25:33.070
Turn your elbow in!
Why aren't you getting it?

25:34.120 --> 25:37.272
Is it really
too complicated or what?

25:37.440 --> 25:39.363
Again! On guard!

25:40.960 --> 25:45.591
Bend your knees! More!
Look where your back foot is!

25:45.760 --> 25:49.970
It has to be in line with your
front foot! Where's your left hand?

25:50.120 --> 25:52.407
You're standing there like a stick!

25:52.560 --> 25:55.632
You'll never learn
if you don't pay attention!

25:55.800 --> 26:00.522
On guard! Back foot
has to be in line with front foot!

26:00.680 --> 26:02.637
Teacher...

26:03.400 --> 26:05.391
What's an extension?

26:11.120 --> 26:14.272
Jaan!
Where are you going? Come back.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.073
Come on. Let's go back.
- I'm not going!

26:21.240 --> 26:25.962
It's no use, I'll never learn!
- Calm down. I'll teach you.

26:26.120 --> 26:31.411
How could you, you're
no good yourself! - What?

26:31.560 --> 26:35.599
You wouldn't be here with us,
if you were any good.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.591
Look at me!

26:57.520 --> 27:02.845
I give you my word I'll make
a fencer out of you. Right?

27:08.760 --> 27:12.970
Comrade Nelis,
someone's here to see you!

27:35.360 --> 27:41.800
Are you the school's new
sports instructor? - I am.

27:41.960 --> 27:47.353
I believe you teach my grandson,
Jaan, fencing. Is that right?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.523
Yes...

27:50.680 --> 27:53.809
I might have something
for you...

28:04.960 --> 28:09.511
I had the honour to attend
the University of Leipzig

28:09.680 --> 28:13.890
before the First World War.
Received my doctoral degree there.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.791
Here you go.
- Thank you.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.961
And this, Jaan, is for you.
- Thanks.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.117
Put it on.

28:46.040 --> 28:48.031
Can you breathe?
- Yes, I can.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.607
Marta, come here...

29:17.560 --> 29:19.551
Who won?
- I did.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.519
Jaan goes to Tiiu,
and Marta will fence Lea.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.083
Be careful with that.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.911
Good boy.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.273
Marta!
- Wait! Hold your horses!

29:57.240 --> 30:01.791
You remember the parents"
meeting on Friday? - Of course.

30:05.520 --> 30:09.195
You might reconsider the fencing.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.793
Excuse me?
- I was just hoping to inform

30:14.960 --> 30:19.170
the City Educational Department
that the fencing was temporary.

30:19.320 --> 30:25.282
And we're going back
to more traditional sports. - I see.

30:25.440 --> 30:28.080
That would be best
for everybody.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.111
I gave you my permission,

30:32.280 --> 30:36.490
but it was for a sports club,
not for fencing.

30:36.640 --> 30:40.190
I don't think the parents
will approve, either.

30:41.320 --> 30:45.325
But we don't know that
before the meeting, do we?

30:45.480 --> 30:50.202
No, we don't. But then again,
this is not Leningrad.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.091
We're not at some
prestigious college.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.671
Things are different here.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.954
You'll see that eventually.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.511
We have one more item to cover.

31:14.680 --> 31:18.355
It has to do with the new
sports club here at our school.

31:19.560 --> 31:22.120
Comrade Nelis. Please.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.277
Thank you.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.650
We started at the end of this Winter

31:29.800 --> 31:33.168
and have been practicing
for some time now.

31:33.320 --> 31:37.405
Would you mind telling us
what you are practicing?

31:40.360 --> 31:44.752
Fencing.
We practice fencing.

31:46.840 --> 31:50.925
At the moment, I have some
two dozen boys and girls in the club,

31:51.080 --> 31:53.310
not all of them attend regularly,

31:53.480 --> 31:58.441
but considering the short time,
we've made good progress.

31:58.600 --> 32:03.231
So, with your permission,
I'd like to continue teaching them...

32:03.400 --> 32:05.323
Thank you, Comrade Nelis.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.563
Comments?

32:24.480 --> 32:27.689
Am I the only one
who feels that this...

32:27.840 --> 32:29.888
relic of the feudal times...

32:30.040 --> 32:33.954
is not quite suitable
for our children?

32:34.120 --> 32:37.670
I agree. The club
is not solely for sports.

32:37.840 --> 32:41.925
Everything we teach at our
schools has a political meaning.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.960
The choice of this particular
sport might be misunderstood.

32:47.040 --> 32:51.432
Our son really likes it...
- That's not the issue here.

32:51.600 --> 32:57.881
I suggest that we let
the sports club continue,

32:58.040 --> 32:59.963
but that in the future

33:00.120 --> 33:02.680
Comrade Nelis will
concentrate on sports

33:02.840 --> 33:05.605
that are better suited
for the proletariat.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.195
Since nobody else
wishes to comment..

33:13.120 --> 33:15.043
Yes?

33:18.920 --> 33:24.040
May l...
- Please.

33:28.120 --> 33:34.401
There's nothing particularly
feudal about fencing.

33:35.880 --> 33:40.636
People have always fenced,
with sticks and spears and swords.

33:41.840 --> 33:46.801
Did you know that as a young man,
Karl Marx was a fencer?

33:46.960 --> 33:50.931
Thank you for sharing
this information with us,

33:51.080 --> 33:53.640
but I strongly
suspect its authenticity.

33:53.800 --> 33:57.805
If I'm not mistaken,
we have two competing stands.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.917
I suggest we take a vote.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.717
Very Well...

34:13.400 --> 34:16.370
I don't have to remind you

34:16.520 --> 34:19.672
that whatever stand
we take here today,

34:19.840 --> 34:25.165
our decision will be made known
to the City Educational Department.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.802
I suggest you all
consider the options with care.

34:33.760 --> 34:37.799
So, those in favor of the fencing,
please raise your hands!

36:49.160 --> 36:51.766
Touche!

36:51.920 --> 36:54.810
Where's your reaction?
You're out of shape.

37:06.720 --> 37:10.122
Where's this?
- Trudovye Resen/y.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.442
You don't recognise it?
- Oh yeah.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.328
Here. Take it.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.277
What's this?

37:22.200 --> 37:25.090
They need a sparring partner
for somebody,

37:25.240 --> 37:28.392
you wouldn't get to compete.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.233
But maybe later you could...

37:36.800 --> 37:38.757
Novosibirsk?

37:38.920 --> 37:41.389
The farther from Leningrad
the better.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.726
Here. You'll leave with me
tomorrow morning.

37:45.880 --> 37:50.397
As soon as we get to Leningrad,
you'll travel on to Novosibirsk.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.197
I can't.

37:57.360 --> 38:00.034
Someone's been making
inqiuries about you.

38:05.960 --> 38:10.682
Who? The Secret Police?
- No, it's not them this time.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.888
What is it?

38:40.040 --> 38:42.953
I've got a favor to ask of you.
- Yeah?

38:44.480 --> 38:46.881
I teach the kids fencing
at school

38:47.040 --> 38:49.930
and the equipment we have
is next to nothing.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.151
So I've been thinking...

38:53.240 --> 38:56.915
If we could join the Spartak,
we would get funding...

38:57.080 --> 38:59.242
An all-Soviet
sports organization?

38:59.400 --> 39:03.246
They'll want to see documents,
ask questions! Are you crazy?

39:03.400 --> 39:06.711
Your life is at stake
and you worry about some kids!

39:06.880 --> 39:10.487
But what should I do?
I just want to live a normal life!

39:10.640 --> 39:12.631
Oh, Endel, you are naive!

39:13.680 --> 39:17.833
Someone's after you,
and you want to live a normal life.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.271
Dear passengers,
we leave in two minutes!

39:21.440 --> 39:23.363
Alexey!

40:10.600 --> 40:13.035
I'm listening.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.191
Goodbye, teacher.
- Goodbye.

40:16.160 --> 40:20.074
Teacher, someone's asking for you!
- Who?

40:20.240 --> 40:22.163
Some men.

40:23.280 --> 40:26.716
I'm calling from Haapsalu
Secondary School Number Two,

40:28.320 --> 40:32.405
I sent you a letter earlier
asking about one of your athletes...

40:32.560 --> 40:36.804
Yes, very impressive,
we can be proud of him...

40:40.800 --> 40:43.872
Is that Secondary School No. 2?
- Yes.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.288
You Comrade Nelis?

40:51.440 --> 40:53.431
Endel Nelis?

40:54.880 --> 40:57.554
Go upstairs,
I'll be there in a moment.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.192
There seems to be some confusion,

41:02.360 --> 41:04.727
or maybe
I misunderstood something...

41:07.840 --> 41:12.596
Thank you. Goodbye.

41:31.160 --> 41:33.231
What's the matter?

41:35.240 --> 41:37.231
We have a delivery for you.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.368
Watch out!

41:49.480 --> 41:51.528
Thank you.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.633
What's in them, teacher?
- How would he know?

41:54.800 --> 41:57.565
Are we gonna open them?
- Of course we are.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.191
Give me a crowbar.

42:15.320 --> 42:17.311
It's heavy.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.083
There are masks here!

42:31.400 --> 42:33.767
Teacher, a letter for you...

42:42.960 --> 42:45.270
"Dear friend,"

42:45.440 --> 42:49.411
"It's all second-hand,
but I thought you wouldn't mind."

42:49.560 --> 42:52.632
"I wish you the best of luck!
Alexey."

42:56.200 --> 42:59.090
What is it?
- Just a letter.

43:54.960 --> 43:57.759
That's correct. Good grip.

45:39.160 --> 45:43.165
Margit, would you put the kettle on?
- Right now?

45:44.160 --> 45:46.151
We have a guest.

45:47.440 --> 45:50.683
Well, can I get you anything?

45:52.400 --> 45:57.122
Vodka, or Georgian Cognac?

45:58.920 --> 46:01.082
No, thank you, I don't drink.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.128
Margit. If you please...

46:15.560 --> 46:19.349
I'd like you to go and see

46:19.520 --> 46:23.639
what you can find out
about Comrade Nelis.

46:25.480 --> 46:31.112
I've written down a list of
places where he used to live,

46:31.280 --> 46:33.806
before he moved to Leningrad...

46:34.960 --> 46:37.566
Keller?
- Oh yes.

46:39.440 --> 46:44.970
Comrade Nelis has changed his name.
He was originally Endel Keller.

46:45.600 --> 46:49.446
Your right leg starts moving.
See how I'm doing it.

46:50.440 --> 46:53.239
Hand, leg...

47:03.880 --> 47:05.837
One more time.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.969
Lower your shoulder.

47:41.040 --> 47:43.111
Hand up. Very good.

47:54.560 --> 47:59.680
"Announce-ment...
All-Soviet..."

48:02.480 --> 48:07.873
Teacher, guess what Jaan found!
- My grandfather did.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.953
Where is it?
- Where'd you put it, Marta?

48:11.120 --> 48:14.363
I just looked at it,
I gave it back to you.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.409
You didn't.
- Tiiu's got it.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.393
Tiiu, come on, bring it here!

48:19.560 --> 48:24.851
See! A tournament!
- Where?

48:24.960 --> 48:26.951
In Leningrad!

48:31.880 --> 48:35.885
Teacher, what's Nelingrad?
- Leningrad!

48:41.960 --> 48:44.486
It is an all-Soviet tournament.

48:44.640 --> 48:48.611
There are teams from big cities,
Moscow, Leningrad...

48:48.760 --> 48:54.961
They have a lot more people,
facilities, equipment, everything...

48:55.120 --> 48:58.636
They can pick and choose
their teams.

49:01.440 --> 49:03.511
And they will choose their best.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.477
We're not going then?

49:07.240 --> 49:09.641
Goodbye.

49:16.920 --> 49:19.924
There'll be other competitions.

49:20.080 --> 49:23.801
In a couple of years time,
you'll be much more prepared...

49:41.920 --> 49:43.968
What is it?
You forgot something?

49:44.680 --> 49:47.684
You won't even let us try!

49:47.840 --> 49:50.446
It's not that simple, Marta.
- It is!

49:50.600 --> 49:56.642
We wanna go, but you won't let us!
- Look, Marta...

49:56.800 --> 49:59.838
You think we're no good?
- No, that's not it...

49:59.960 --> 50:02.691
Why then?
- It's not that you're not good.

50:02.840 --> 50:04.763
You are good.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.968
But it will be tough out there.

50:09.120 --> 50:12.488
And we've only been practicing
for a very short time.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.950
And you're not
quite ready yet for...

50:22.080 --> 50:27.769
As grandpa had heard
from his grandpa,

50:27.920 --> 50:32.676
many a king's sons had tried

50:32.840 --> 50:37.926
to get through the slubbery...
- Shrubbery.

50:38.840 --> 50:41.912
...of rose.

51:11.960 --> 51:13.883
Good.

52:11.480 --> 52:14.120
Are you Jaan Kask?
- Yes.

52:15.080 --> 52:18.209
Are you part of that fencing club?

52:19.760 --> 52:21.751
Is your grandfather in?

52:25.160 --> 52:28.073
You listening? Is he in or not?

52:35.840 --> 52:37.797
Don't go;

52:46.120 --> 52:50.205
Listen to me.
You're a man now.

52:50.360 --> 52:54.331
Support your mother
and don't worry about me.

52:54.480 --> 52:57.848
Become a good fencer,

52:57.960 --> 53:00.964
then everything will be alright.
Got it?

55:13.160 --> 55:17.950
It's me, Endel! There's
a tournament in Leningrad and l...

55:18.160 --> 55:20.151
Who do you want?

55:22.440 --> 55:26.047
Could I speak to Alexey Petrovich?- He's not in.

55:26.200 --> 55:31.229
Who's asking?- Just tell him it's a friend...

55:31.400 --> 55:34.768
Do you have a message for him?- No, that's all right.

55:37.920 --> 55:42.676
I don't know... One moment...

55:43.600 --> 55:47.207
It's long distance from Leningrad
to Comrade Nelis!

55:48.240 --> 55:50.311
He's not here yet...
- I know!

55:50.480 --> 55:52.710
But someone's gotta
take this call!

55:52.880 --> 55:55.884
He just keeps calling and calling!
- I can't...

55:56.040 --> 55:59.169
One moment! His very
good friend is here now.

55:59.320 --> 56:01.277
Please.

56:08.440 --> 56:12.525
Hello? Who is this?

56:22.680 --> 56:24.728
What are you doing here?

56:28.040 --> 56:33.433
I talked to your coach...
- Alexey?

56:34.720 --> 56:36.677
He called from Leningrad.

56:39.920 --> 56:41.877
What did he have to say?

56:43.200 --> 56:47.831
He said that under no circumstances
should you go to Leningrad!

56:50.920 --> 56:52.877
What did he mean by that?

56:57.560 --> 57:02.407
Why can't you go there?
What's there in Leningrad?

57:16.720 --> 57:18.791
It Was...

57:24.280 --> 57:30.049
It was during the war,
I'd just turned eighteen.

57:32.040 --> 57:36.887
I got drafted.
- By the Germans?

57:38.240 --> 57:42.518
We all were. All my friends
and schoolmates.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.930
We were all in the same unit.

57:50.360 --> 57:53.967
Later on, we ran away
and hid in the woods.

57:58.720 --> 58:03.203
In fact, we were lucky...
Well, I was.

58:05.480 --> 58:09.030
At the end of the war,
when the Russians started coming,

58:09.200 --> 58:11.157
I managed to sneak out.

58:14.320 --> 58:17.961
I got to Leningrad and started
using my mother's name...

58:20.640 --> 58:24.611
You can't go there!
It's too dangerous!

58:30.720 --> 58:36.409
I feel as if I've been running
all my life and I'm tired of it.

58:36.560 --> 58:39.689
So instead you want
to be sent to Siberia to die?

58:39.840 --> 58:44.710
What should I say to the children?
What should I tell them?

58:46.640 --> 58:50.247
I can't let them down!
They trust me.

58:51.360 --> 58:54.876
They trust me like a...
- A father?

58:59.640 --> 59:02.075
Yes, like a father.

59:06.240 --> 59:09.517
Do you know how many of them
have fathers?

59:10.520 --> 59:12.955
Have you asked?
- Yes, I have!

59:13.120 --> 59:16.556
Toomas' father is dead,
and so is Marta's!

59:16.720 --> 59:20.600
She looks after two little ones,
while her mother works two shifts!

59:20.760 --> 59:24.515
Jaan's father is missing and
now they took his grandfather!

59:24.680 --> 59:27.570
But I saw their faces
when they heard

59:27.720 --> 59:30.610
that their fathers will not
come back, ever.

59:30.760 --> 59:35.243
And that wasn't even the worst part.
It was the endless, useless waiting!

59:35.400 --> 59:38.233
You can't go!

59:47.880 --> 59:49.951
Maybe that's why I need to go...

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.151
Kadri, wait...

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.031
What are you doing here?

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.473
What are you doing here?
- Practicing.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.910
You shouldn't stay here this late.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.710
Does your mother know
where you are?

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.088
She's at work.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.157
What do you find the hardest?

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.566
What do you have
to practice the most?

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.046
I think... The circular quarte.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.391
Get your mask.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.917
Go get your mask!

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.400
Very good. Again.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.150
I've got something to tell you.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.680
I've chosen the team
for the tournament.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.725
But we thought we weren't going.
- That's what I thought, too.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.637
But we are.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.791
You deserve it.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.883
So who's going?
- You.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.391
And you too, Jaan.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.431
And...

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.317
And Lea.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:33.170
The team will have
three members and an alternate.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.048
That's what the rules say.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.316
And the alternate...

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.917
...is Marta.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.956
I told you! I knew it!

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.601
All right, let's get to work,
we've still got lots to do.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.956
Step forward and thrust.
Those by the window will begin.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.969
Go!

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.471
Endel Keller

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.688
German Military Passport

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.151
Endel!

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.566
So, everything ready?
Thank you. Let's go.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:10.082

What should I do? I'm leaving
your team out. - No, don't!

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:46.050

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.309
Thrust by the fencer on the right.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.359
I'm just doing
what is expected of me.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.151
It's a sound principle
and it has put me where I am in life.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.150
What about the children?
- You needn't worry about them.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.277
That's why I'm here.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:41.470
As for you, you can still
just walk away.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.611
It's the Soviet Union,
a big country.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.071
They might fund you,
but then again, they might not.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.751
You're not my problem anymore.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.591

Where've you been?
It's the final match!

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.560
We're fencing for gold!
- Jaan just evened out the score!

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.471
Don't go away anymore!

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:10.749
Promise?
We don't want to fence alone.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.913
Halt! Off target!

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.871
Kask, put your mask on.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:52.911
Very good, Jaan!

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.211
That's right, tie him down!

Attack - touch - point!
Kask, 4-3!

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.843
Doctor, please.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.930
What happened?
- I think he twisted his ankle.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.288
This hurts, too?

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.568
Your turn, Marta.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.966
Why me?
- Cause you're the alternate.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.966
Look what he did to Lea.
I don't stand a chance!

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.953
We're winning!
You'll just have to keep score!

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.629
I can't do it.
- It's just 15 seconds.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.486
Just don't let him
control the distance!

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.957
Now go! Go and fence!
That's what you came here for!

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.601
Romanov, Moscow -
Mikk, Haapsalu, Estonia.

Fence!

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.357
Don't fall back too much!

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.231
Over the line.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.470
You fell back over the line.
You can't do that anymore.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.631
Time?
- 4 seconds left.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.962
Four seconds to go.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.671
Ready?

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.951
Fence.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.592
Attack - touch - point!

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.191
4- 4!

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.034

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.122
Three seconds to the end, Marta!

Time!
- Time's up.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.848
We're drawing priority.

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.046
Romanov, Moscow gets priority.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.839
What does it mean?
- They have priority.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:56.194
If you don't score
within a minute, they'll win!

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:58.670
Don't worry, everything's alright.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.270
Extra time, one minute.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.951
Your masks.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.111
Ready?

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.117
Fence!

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.391
Don't rush! Defend!

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.271
Mind the rear line!

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.796
Attack - touch - point!

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.630
