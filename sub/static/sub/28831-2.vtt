00:00.585 --> 00:03.003
You know, in fact,
I was kinda hoping that,

00:03.028 --> 00:04.835
maybe, you'd want to join my team?

00:04.860 --> 00:08.141
We're just so excited for the
first all-female team at Speckulate!

00:12.221 --> 00:13.955
Don't use me because
you don't want to deal

00:13.979 --> 00:15.119
with whatever's bothering you.

00:15.143 --> 00:16.242
It's not fair.

00:17.608 --> 00:18.608
I love you.

00:20.356 --> 00:22.673
I am not moving back to Wisconsin.

00:22.698 --> 00:23.698
I left Lily.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.655
Promise me that if you
ever feel suicidal again,

00:27.680 --> 00:28.872
you'll just come to me.

00:29.038 --> 00:31.213
The jury finds the defendants

00:31.946 --> 00:33.129
not liable.

00:33.154 --> 00:34.437
You were a good son.

00:37.227 --> 00:40.144
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

00:40.169 --> 00:41.343
Jamal's life mattered!

00:41.368 --> 00:43.768
Do you have you federal
court security card on you?

01:10.771 --> 01:13.422
Our goal is to bridge
the access-to-justice gap

01:13.447 --> 01:14.876
for the indigent and under-privileged,

01:14.900 --> 01:16.866
and we're currently suing
the city for not making enough

01:16.890 --> 01:19.834
publicly funded housing accessible
to people with disabilities.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.609
We work with the Innocence Project.

01:24.634 --> 01:27.695
As well as overturning
wrongful convictions of youth.

01:32.999 --> 01:36.477
At the A.C.L.U., you'll have
eight project areas to choose from:

01:36.502 --> 01:40.396
policing, jails,
immigration, education...

01:40.421 --> 01:42.645
Domestic abuse, child
rights and services,

01:42.670 --> 01:43.994
shelters for abused women...

01:44.019 --> 01:46.995
First Amendment, LGBTQ,
reproductive rights...

01:47.020 --> 01:49.619
We're currently appealing
three death row cases.

01:49.644 --> 01:51.172
And that sounds amazing. Amazing.

01:51.197 --> 01:52.889
And exactly... Exactly... Exactly...

01:52.914 --> 01:54.130
... what I want to do.

01:56.376 --> 01:58.000
Now, that's a power suit.

01:58.025 --> 02:00.276
You are going to blow
them away at your new job.

02:03.143 --> 02:05.179
It's my dream to work for the A.C.L.U.

02:05.704 --> 02:07.027
Once you pass the bar,

02:07.052 --> 02:09.496
I don't see why we can't
make that dream come true.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.903
Working on the weekend?

02:20.571 --> 02:23.106
Yeah, so much to do now
that I'm a team leader.

02:24.079 --> 02:26.242
Can I... uh, help?

02:27.138 --> 02:30.715
Um, sure. I'm kind of
just stuck on this code.

02:38.979 --> 02:40.279

03:12.531 --> 03:14.531

03:16.640 --> 03:19.052
Mariana.

03:19.077 --> 03:20.193
What?

03:20.706 --> 03:21.739
Wake up.

03:24.862 --> 03:26.562
- What?
- Wake up.

03:27.737 --> 03:29.156
Wake up.

03:29.867 --> 03:32.187
Your alarm's been going
off for like ten minutes.

03:58.676 --> 04:02.070
You know, it's normal to have
a sex dream about your boss.

04:02.095 --> 04:03.536
It doesn't mean you're attracted to him.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.184
I'm not, at all.

04:05.209 --> 04:06.967
I mean, I just... I feel icky, like,

04:06.992 --> 04:08.308
like I cheated on Raj.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.509
Oh, how's it going
with the hooded warrior?

04:10.769 --> 04:12.251
- Amazing.
- Hmm!

04:12.276 --> 04:15.061
I thought it'd be too much dating
and working together on my app,

04:15.086 --> 04:16.444
but it's been great.

04:16.874 --> 04:18.940
So, everyone at work knows
that you're hitting it?

04:18.966 --> 04:20.999
- Oh, no.
- You know, that's hot.

04:21.204 --> 04:22.895
So, you guys are, like, sneaking around,

04:22.920 --> 04:24.949
- doing it in the supply closet?
- No.

04:24.974 --> 04:27.001
Oh, come on, everyone smashes at work.

04:27.026 --> 04:28.834
- They do?
- No.

04:36.519 --> 04:37.609
Oh, my God.

04:37.859 --> 04:39.711
You hooked up in Wilson's office?

04:39.736 --> 04:41.764
With Jamie or Gael?

04:41.789 --> 04:43.180
I would rather not say.

04:43.205 --> 04:44.300
You know, actually, come to think of it,

04:44.324 --> 04:46.284
I haven't seen a lot
of Jamie around lately.

04:51.486 --> 04:53.817
Okay, after everything
that happened today,

04:54.845 --> 04:56.645
I, I don't know what I'm doing.

04:58.663 --> 05:02.122
I'm not saying that I
don't want to be with you.

05:03.635 --> 05:05.994
I just, I need some time and space to...

05:06.533 --> 05:07.933
to get my shit together.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.870
But I understand if you
can't give that to me.

05:14.321 --> 05:16.407
Is this your way of making
me break up with you

05:16.432 --> 05:17.592
so you don't have to do it?

05:19.410 --> 05:20.410
No.

05:24.054 --> 05:25.579
No, it's not.

05:26.423 --> 05:27.423
I promise.

05:32.305 --> 05:34.105
Then take the time you need.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.767
Yeah, Jamie and
I are on a break.

05:40.899 --> 05:42.139
Okay, Ross.

05:45.014 --> 05:46.256
Oh, oops.

05:47.015 --> 05:49.300
Got your mocks for the app ready.

05:49.325 --> 05:50.820
Great. Can't wait to see them.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.047
How is it working with Gael?

05:56.806 --> 05:58.907
It's great. He super talented.

05:58.932 --> 06:00.296
I'm super happy he's on my team.

06:00.733 --> 06:02.683
Do you guys ever talk about me?

06:02.876 --> 06:04.650
Oh, constantly.

06:04.675 --> 06:06.533
You know, even though we
have a ton of work to do,

06:06.557 --> 06:08.757
we spend almost all of
our time talking about you.

06:09.571 --> 06:12.998
No, I just like wonder
where his head's at.

06:13.169 --> 06:15.761
You mean, if he's waiting around for you

06:15.786 --> 06:17.147
to decide who you want to be with?

06:17.172 --> 06:18.549
I don't expect him to wait for me.

06:19.094 --> 06:20.329
- You don't?
- No.

06:20.886 --> 06:23.297
Why don't you just
make up your mind already?

06:23.322 --> 06:27.024
No, I am not dating
anyone until I get a job,

06:27.049 --> 06:29.253
and I can't get a job
until I've passed the bar.

06:29.458 --> 06:30.912
Which I will hopefully know about soon.

06:30.936 --> 06:31.950
Well, in the meantime,

06:31.975 --> 06:34.040
there's really no temporary
position you can fill?

06:35.384 --> 06:39.403
No. No, there aren't any other
positions I'm qualified for, so...

06:41.281 --> 06:43.749
I guess I could get a retail job.

06:43.868 --> 06:45.409
No, don't be ridiculous.

06:45.635 --> 06:48.107
I'll keep paying the bills until
you find out your bar results.

06:48.131 --> 06:49.690
Oh, speaking of which, um,

06:49.715 --> 06:52.655
I got a notice that I've
almost used up my data plan?

06:53.575 --> 06:56.966
Oh, uh, yeah, I took
you off of unlimited.

06:57.385 --> 07:00.036
With you not working, how
much data do you really need?

07:00.509 --> 07:03.103
Hey, by the way, do you mind
picking up my dry cleaning?

07:03.128 --> 07:04.637
- Sure.
- Thank you.

07:05.105 --> 07:08.472
Oh, and, uh, I need
toothpaste and shampoo.

07:08.775 --> 07:10.135
- Okay.
- Thank you.

07:12.144 --> 07:14.862
You don't think you're,
like, blackballed, do you?

07:16.354 --> 07:17.874
Like in the legal world?

07:25.437 --> 07:27.830
So, it isn't on your resume,

07:27.855 --> 07:30.723
but I did a little
asking around about you

07:31.100 --> 07:34.793
and I found out that you were
clerking for Judge Curtis Wilson

07:34.818 --> 07:36.668
for just a, a few months?

07:37.293 --> 07:38.717
What happened there?

07:42.958 --> 07:45.770
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

07:45.795 --> 07:46.978
Jamal's life mattered!

07:47.003 --> 07:48.714
Does this look like a gun to you?

07:48.739 --> 07:51.007
- Objection. Testifying.
- Sustained.

07:51.032 --> 07:53.867
- Objection. Objection.
- Sustained. Sustained.

07:53.892 --> 07:55.360
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Overruled.

07:55.385 --> 07:57.672
In your deliberations,
you may give consideration

07:57.697 --> 08:00.380
to the relevance of comments
made by Chief Kelley,

08:00.405 --> 08:03.040
to determine the state of
mind of Officer Griffin,

08:03.065 --> 08:06.834
as there's no way to know what
impact, if any, they had on him.

08:07.172 --> 08:10.099
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

08:10.124 --> 08:12.925
Jamal's life mattered!
Jamal's life mattered!

08:12.950 --> 08:14.994
- Jamal's life mattered!
- Where is he?

08:15.019 --> 08:16.436
- Oh!
- Where's Judge Wilson?

08:16.461 --> 08:17.764
- No, you need to leave. Miss!
- Judge Wilson!

08:17.788 --> 08:18.868
I need to speak to you.

08:20.897 --> 08:22.387
You call yourself a judge?

08:22.412 --> 08:23.904
- Isn't it your job to make sure...
- I need security.

08:23.928 --> 08:25.256
that everyone gets a fair trial?

08:25.281 --> 08:27.598
- That the jury decides and not you!
- The jury did decide.

08:27.622 --> 08:30.273
No, because you let them get
away with seating one black juror!

08:30.298 --> 08:32.072
You sustained every defense objection.

08:32.097 --> 08:34.511
You told the jury that
they didn't have to consider

08:34.537 --> 08:37.562
a Chief of Police telling
officers to let people die!

08:37.572 --> 08:39.657
You are proof that the system
is rigged against people

08:39.681 --> 08:41.164
- who cannot pay for justice!
- Ma'am?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.639
A mother lost her son!

08:42.664 --> 08:44.305
- Ma'am!
- Her only child!

08:44.330 --> 08:46.130
Have you no heart Judge Wilson?

08:46.669 --> 08:48.749
Have you no humanity! Shame on you!

08:49.607 --> 08:50.807
Shame on you!

09:13.073 --> 09:14.073
Callie?

09:26.086 --> 09:27.137
I'm going to assume

09:27.162 --> 09:29.470
you didn't give your security
card to Malika Williams?

09:30.062 --> 09:31.113
No, Your Honor.

09:31.978 --> 09:34.428
But she doesn't just
live in your building.

09:34.888 --> 09:35.946
She's your friend?

09:36.780 --> 09:38.088
We have become friends,

09:39.265 --> 09:42.876
but I never shared any information
with her about the case

09:42.901 --> 09:46.310
and I was very careful not
to cross any ethical lines.

09:48.162 --> 09:50.439
But you could have easily given her

09:50.464 --> 09:52.056
Officer Griffin's personnel files,

09:52.081 --> 09:53.480
just slipped them under her door?

09:53.505 --> 09:55.865
I already told you, I didn't
give them to her or anyone.

09:57.259 --> 09:59.379
And I know I should
have given them to you.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.368
And yet...

10:04.663 --> 10:05.663
but you didn't.

10:08.710 --> 10:11.535
- Your friend is in a lot of trouble.
- She's a good person.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.821
- Who stole your credentials.
- In the heat of the moment.

10:13.845 --> 10:16.250
Everyone has to be held accountable
for their actions, Callie.

10:16.274 --> 10:17.274
But not your son?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.959
My son is being held accountable, by me!

10:20.984 --> 10:22.760
Well, Malika doesn't have a wealthy,

10:22.785 --> 10:25.009
connected father to
advocate for her, sir.

10:25.034 --> 10:26.167
And what about you?

10:27.163 --> 10:28.716
What should I do about you, Callie?

10:28.741 --> 10:31.381
- How should I hold you accountable?
- You should probably fire me.

11:04.225 --> 11:06.391
I know you'll buy your
parents a beautiful house.

11:11.518 --> 11:12.725
Thank you for everything.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.265
You take good care.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.351
Naomi?

11:32.743 --> 11:34.467
Will you let the U.S. attorney know

11:34.492 --> 11:36.872
I wish to press charges
against Malika Williams?

11:54.345 --> 11:56.570
I have worked for you
going on ten years,

11:57.985 --> 12:00.553
and though I didn't always agree
with some of your decisions,

12:00.578 --> 12:01.970
I kept my mouth shut

12:02.889 --> 12:06.349
because I wasn't hired
to give my opinion.

12:07.512 --> 12:09.478
But today I'm going to.

12:11.845 --> 12:13.121
That young woman

12:14.553 --> 12:18.130
was overcome by a lifetime
of anger and frustration,

12:18.155 --> 12:20.339
of not being seen or heard,

12:20.961 --> 12:23.838
and being treated by some as less than

12:24.234 --> 12:26.474
and there wasn't a damn
thing she could do about it.

12:28.465 --> 12:31.216
I know this is hard
for you to understand.

12:31.241 --> 12:33.135
But I'm not asking you to understand.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.279
I am asking you not to ruin
this young woman's life.

12:37.304 --> 12:38.838
She made a mistake,

12:38.863 --> 12:40.946
and you know the consequences of that

12:40.971 --> 12:42.491
are far greater for her.

12:45.825 --> 12:48.392
I have never asked a favor of you,

12:49.032 --> 12:51.083
but I'm asking you, please

12:51.627 --> 12:54.167
do not punish this woman for just...

12:56.030 --> 12:57.990
living while black in this country.

13:07.981 --> 13:09.014
What's going on?

13:09.646 --> 13:11.121
It's a surprise.

13:11.146 --> 13:13.240
Yeah, my parents'
divorce was a surprise.

13:13.265 --> 13:15.081
So was my appendicitis.

13:15.106 --> 13:16.546
Hello.

13:17.534 --> 13:18.534
Good morning.

13:21.054 --> 13:24.372
In an effort to show
our female colleagues

13:24.397 --> 13:28.950
how much we appreciate them,
and that we hear your concerns,

13:28.975 --> 13:34.871
today is the first annual
Women's Day at Speckulate.

13:34.896 --> 13:36.512
I had nothing to do with this.

13:38.921 --> 13:41.412
We have donuts,

13:42.198 --> 13:43.198
and balloons.

13:44.234 --> 13:47.168
And manicure and pedicure stations.

13:47.193 --> 13:50.645
So, women, enjoy!

13:54.687 --> 13:55.927
Is this a joke?

13:56.750 --> 13:58.224
Pink lemonade mimosa?

13:58.553 --> 14:00.136
Is there a raise in there?

14:17.598 --> 14:18.838
Oh, hey.

14:20.103 --> 14:21.143
Hey.

14:24.295 --> 14:26.870
"Facing the death of a child
may be the hardest thing

14:26.895 --> 14:29.194
a person can experience."

14:29.219 --> 14:33.046
Some ways to care for
yourself include exercising.

14:33.071 --> 14:36.129
See? This isn't so bad.

14:38.387 --> 14:41.572
No, no, Dennis. Come
on. Come on. Come on.

14:42.075 --> 14:43.595
Diet.

14:44.955 --> 14:46.346
What's all this?

14:46.559 --> 14:48.091
Mood enhancing foods.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.460
What is this coconut
oil doing in the trash?

14:57.461 --> 14:58.685
We got this.

14:59.002 --> 15:00.583
Twenty more and we're done.

15:02.678 --> 15:03.735
Nine...

15:07.610 --> 15:10.337
No. Okay, it's not, it's not funny!

15:10.585 --> 15:13.613
Get off! Dennis! Get off! Dennis!

15:14.375 --> 15:18.169
Mediation or alternative therapies.

15:21.094 --> 15:24.046
- ... article about the President...
- Dennis!

15:24.071 --> 15:26.863
There's nothing more depressing
than political podcasts!

15:33.681 --> 15:35.481
I am trying to help you

15:35.506 --> 15:37.131
every way that I know how,

15:37.156 --> 15:39.932
but if you won't help me
help you, what is the point?

15:39.957 --> 15:42.809
Look, I appreciate
everything you're doing,

15:42.834 --> 15:44.917
- but...
- I know, I, I don't get it.

15:44.942 --> 15:47.017
I never lost a child.

15:48.054 --> 15:51.275
Which is why you need to go to
a grief group support meeting

15:51.300 --> 15:53.740
and talk to people who know
what you're going through.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.660
Please?

15:58.058 --> 15:59.382
Okay, I'll go.

15:59.407 --> 16:04.636
If you stop making me eat salmon
and listen to binaural beats.

16:04.661 --> 16:08.913
Fine, and I will just
cancel the cryotherapy.

16:09.505 --> 16:10.530
What's that?

16:10.555 --> 16:12.618
It's where you stand in an
ice-cold chamber for three minutes

16:12.642 --> 16:14.324
and it's supposed to produce endorphins.

16:15.773 --> 16:17.933
What? I got it on Groupon. Thank you.

16:21.719 --> 16:25.770
Mm. You know, I got to admit,
unemployment isn't all bad.

16:25.795 --> 16:26.861
I'm sorry.

16:26.886 --> 16:30.238
- Mm, you already said you're sorry.
- It's not good enough.

16:30.263 --> 16:32.825
- It's my fault you lost your job.
- No, it's not your fault.

16:33.173 --> 16:34.855
I'm happy to be out of there,

16:34.880 --> 16:38.181
and I'm excited to start making
a real difference somewhere.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.607
Is this gonna follow you?

16:41.486 --> 16:42.561
I don't think so.

16:43.245 --> 16:45.848
Okay, so why aren't you spending
your day off in bed with Isaac?

16:46.067 --> 16:47.852
Well, girl, he has his own business.

16:47.877 --> 16:49.797
It's not like he can call in sick.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.834
Are you guys, like, official?

16:54.153 --> 16:55.353
I want you to meet my family.

16:58.281 --> 17:00.307
- Get out.
- I'm serious.

17:01.172 --> 17:02.412
I'm serious.

17:04.869 --> 17:07.140
Uh, both my brothers
and my sister, we...

17:07.477 --> 17:10.086
we go to our parents' house
every Sunday and have dinner.

17:10.741 --> 17:12.421
You sure they're ready
for this hot mess?

17:14.560 --> 17:16.150
I mean, you're hot, for sure,

17:16.175 --> 17:18.122
but you're not a mess.

17:19.281 --> 17:22.481
Although, I wouldn't mind if you
just, just took a little break

17:22.880 --> 17:25.280
from all this activism stuff.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.430
- Oh.
- At least, on the front lines.

17:27.454 --> 17:29.455
So, you don't have to
bail me out of jail again?

17:31.034 --> 17:33.714
I mean, you don't always have
to live in the pain of struggle.

17:35.514 --> 17:39.048
You know, us thriving
is a form of protest.

17:39.073 --> 17:40.873
- I know.
- You do?

17:45.062 --> 17:46.863
Maybe a couple of Sundays from now.

17:48.047 --> 17:50.339
After all, it's not like
we're official, you know?

17:51.024 --> 17:52.264
Are we not official?

17:54.308 --> 17:55.577
Hmm?

17:55.602 --> 17:57.544
Oh, it is so on!

17:57.569 --> 18:01.186
- Okay, that's what he says.
- No, you love it! You're so into him.

18:02.357 --> 18:03.598
What's up with your love life?

18:03.623 --> 18:04.973
You still on a break with Jamie?

18:05.605 --> 18:07.405
I'm just figuring stuff out.

18:08.310 --> 18:10.227
Stuff like Gael?

18:11.898 --> 18:13.407
Jamie told me he loves me.

18:13.978 --> 18:16.778
- Girl.
- Like they're so different.

18:16.966 --> 18:20.809
Jamie is sweet and dependable,

18:20.834 --> 18:22.509
and we have the law in common.

18:23.165 --> 18:26.741
And Gael is, also, sweet
and, like, sensitive,

18:26.766 --> 18:31.961
and an artist, and just the kind
of guy you can lose yourself in.

18:32.775 --> 18:35.185
Well, girl, you are strong
enough to get lost in love

18:35.210 --> 18:36.963
and still keep your
wits about you in life.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.640
You just got to trust your instincts.

18:40.429 --> 18:42.871
I mean, at your most vulnerable moments,

18:42.896 --> 18:44.462
who do you want to call?

18:44.937 --> 18:46.677
Whose arms do you want around you?

18:52.801 --> 18:53.801
Hi.

18:56.025 --> 18:57.683
Uh, are you looking for someone?

18:58.260 --> 19:00.494
Hey, uh, sorry about that. Uh...

19:01.345 --> 19:05.548
- No, actually.
- This is Malika and Callie.

19:06.108 --> 19:08.291
Hey. I'm Elijah.

19:11.322 --> 19:12.402
Have you ever been in love?

19:13.998 --> 19:15.106
Once.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.099
Who was she, or he?

19:23.624 --> 19:25.124
His name is Elijah.

19:26.796 --> 19:28.036
What happened?

19:29.110 --> 19:30.670
Just weren't ready for each other.

19:37.345 --> 19:39.265
- You want to come up?
- Yeah.

19:42.377 --> 19:44.077
Any idea who that might be?

19:52.161 --> 19:53.645
Sorry I missed the show.

19:54.019 --> 19:56.787
I love your work, but I always have.

19:57.918 --> 19:59.218
Not always.

19:59.885 --> 20:01.412
One piece I didn't like.

20:02.725 --> 20:06.219
You said it looked like a
donkey scribbled on a wall

20:06.244 --> 20:07.702
with a crayon in its ass.

20:07.727 --> 20:10.112
I said that? Are you sure?

20:10.338 --> 20:12.513
It's not a critique one easily forgets.

20:16.821 --> 20:19.054
This is sexy.

20:21.244 --> 20:23.244
Sure, would look great in my showroom.

20:24.574 --> 20:28.125
Can I buy it from you, or do
I need to talk to your dealer?

20:30.492 --> 20:32.192
I feel weird making you pay for it.

20:32.479 --> 20:33.959
I don't mind paying for it.

20:37.899 --> 20:39.182
You can have it.

20:39.207 --> 20:40.907
You can't just give your work away.

20:41.205 --> 20:42.205
It's not for sale.

20:44.315 --> 20:45.315
Fair enough.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.520
You'll just have to invite
me to your next show.

20:48.544 --> 20:51.136
That way I can buy from
your gallery anonymously.

20:51.986 --> 20:54.026
Somebody just did that.

20:55.251 --> 20:58.352
- It wasn't...
- No! I wasn't invited, remember?

21:03.600 --> 21:04.908
How's business?

21:04.933 --> 21:06.801
Good.

21:07.648 --> 21:09.640
I've just been doing
a lot of red carpet.

21:09.953 --> 21:12.553
I just dressed Emily
Blunt and Emma Stone.

21:13.014 --> 21:15.054
Yeah, I saw that. Congratulations.

21:21.419 --> 21:22.579
I'm sorry.

21:25.396 --> 21:26.505
For what?

21:27.287 --> 21:30.367
For hurting you. I was an asshole.

21:33.039 --> 21:35.050
Everyone in college is an asshole.

21:35.731 --> 21:36.764
You weren't.

21:39.861 --> 21:43.361
But you did have that
man bun thing going on.

21:44.204 --> 21:46.745
Yeah, what about that
poncho you never took off?

21:51.792 --> 21:52.912
So...

21:53.651 --> 21:56.131
are you seeing anyone special?

22:11.494 --> 22:13.573
Have you seen Alice? Is she here?

22:13.598 --> 22:14.606
Nope.

22:17.359 --> 22:19.668
- Where's Malika?
- She went out.

22:20.362 --> 22:21.995
- Kelly?
- Nope.

22:23.373 --> 22:25.001
Okay, listen, I have to talk to someone,

22:25.026 --> 22:26.323
so you're going to have to do.

22:26.817 --> 22:30.528
I, I haven't exactly
broken up with Jeff yet.

22:31.124 --> 22:33.182
You know, he left his wife
before I could tell him

22:33.207 --> 22:35.231
that I am not moving
back home to be with him,

22:36.166 --> 22:38.986
and now I feel terrible because
he ruined his life for me

22:39.008 --> 22:40.443
and he's having a really tough time

22:40.468 --> 22:41.996
and I just, I don't know what to do.

22:43.477 --> 22:44.610
Okay.

22:45.508 --> 22:49.467
So, is moving back to Wisconsin
the issue, or is Jeff the issue?

22:49.492 --> 22:50.609
Both.

22:51.151 --> 22:53.576
No, I love him. I really do.

22:54.044 --> 22:55.545
But things have changed.

22:55.762 --> 22:57.861
You know, my feelings have changed,

22:57.886 --> 23:00.021
but I feel like a total
shit for dumping him now.

23:00.609 --> 23:01.969
What if you get him to dump you?

23:02.780 --> 23:03.842
How?

23:03.867 --> 23:06.463
Just tell him that you don't
want to move back to Wisconsin,

23:06.628 --> 23:08.128
and that your life is here now.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.393
Make it his choice.

23:11.326 --> 23:13.052
You know, I actually
hadn't thought of that.

23:13.077 --> 23:14.512
He loves his life in Fitchburg.

23:14.537 --> 23:15.912
That might work. Thanks.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.536
Yeah, happy to help.

23:17.561 --> 23:19.201
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah.

23:20.866 --> 23:22.426
I like you better this way.

23:24.578 --> 23:25.818
Thank you?

23:34.036 --> 23:36.421
So, how was Women's Day received?

23:37.166 --> 23:39.175
Um, fine.

23:41.349 --> 23:44.136
I was surprised more women
didn't get manicures or pedicures.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.481
I thought they'd appreciate that.

23:48.568 --> 23:52.745
Uh, look, what they'd
appreciate is a raise.

23:52.987 --> 23:54.837
To get paid what the men are paid.

23:54.925 --> 23:55.925
How's that going?

23:57.190 --> 23:58.232
I'm working on it.

23:58.369 --> 24:00.179
I have to answer to my
Board of Directors...

24:00.204 --> 24:02.084
Who, let me guess, are all men?

24:03.490 --> 24:04.610
I'm working on that too.

24:06.660 --> 24:10.811
Do you know that 93%
of boardroom members

24:10.836 --> 24:13.345
at all private tech firms are men?

24:13.678 --> 24:15.520
That's 7% left for the women.

24:15.545 --> 24:18.013
Even the Fortune 500s are up 17%

24:18.038 --> 24:21.398
of women in the boardroom,
which is still lame.

24:23.254 --> 24:24.804
Hmm. I love that.

24:25.358 --> 24:27.561
You love that women are
left out of the boardroom?

24:28.007 --> 24:31.843
No. No, I love that
you're a statistics person.

24:32.192 --> 24:35.251
- Look, Women's Day was...
- It was lame.

24:36.979 --> 24:38.528
A nice gesture.

24:39.834 --> 24:42.594
Women want more than
pink donuts and manicures.

24:44.489 --> 24:46.575
I'm trying to close
the gender pay gap...

24:46.600 --> 24:47.933
And race pay gap.

24:48.165 --> 24:52.024
Yes, but what can I do in the meantime?

24:52.049 --> 24:55.167
I don't know. Why don't you form
an employee grievance committee

24:55.192 --> 24:57.152
to make suggestions to management?

24:59.393 --> 25:01.577
Yes. Great. Do that.

25:04.305 --> 25:05.388
Who do that?

25:05.898 --> 25:07.039
You do that.

25:07.516 --> 25:09.399
M-me do that? I mean, me?

25:12.637 --> 25:14.863
I think, uh, this is it. Shall we?

25:15.346 --> 25:16.913
Are you, you coming in?

25:17.434 --> 25:19.752
Oh, well, I mean, I thought I would.

25:20.039 --> 25:21.638
You know, for support.

25:21.663 --> 25:24.798
Hmm, that's what the people
in the support group are for.

25:26.236 --> 25:27.710
Look, you got me here.

25:28.808 --> 25:31.891
Okay, but I think I
need to do this alone.

25:34.289 --> 25:37.364
Okay. I'll check in
with you later tonight.

25:58.844 --> 26:00.260
I am so happy to see you.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.308
You didn't have to drive
all the way out here.

26:10.333 --> 26:11.543
I would have come to you.

26:11.567 --> 26:12.982
I know.

26:12.983 --> 26:16.360
Things at the Coterie have
been really hectic lately.

26:19.083 --> 26:20.083
You okay?

26:22.038 --> 26:24.888
I applied for a third
year of Teach For America,

26:25.404 --> 26:26.937
like you told me to do

26:27.506 --> 26:30.215
when you said that I should stay in L.A.

26:32.732 --> 26:35.192
And I don't, I don't
want to move back home.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.300
My life is here. It's...

26:39.756 --> 26:41.256
It's not in Fitchburg.

26:45.859 --> 26:46.892
I'm so sorry,

26:46.917 --> 26:49.157
but I never thought that
you would leave Lily.

26:59.403 --> 27:00.403
It's okay.

27:02.286 --> 27:03.526
I understand.

27:10.734 --> 27:12.034
She lost a lot of stuff

27:13.119 --> 27:14.919
moving around, over the years.

27:16.771 --> 27:18.971
I mean, you can have, you
know, whatever you want.

27:25.847 --> 27:27.241
She never lost this.

27:29.799 --> 27:31.852
You remember her dragging
us to church every Sunday,

27:31.877 --> 27:34.158
no matter what shape she was in?

27:35.172 --> 27:37.092
Hey, at least she gave us something:

27:37.451 --> 27:39.951
God and Jesus.

27:45.139 --> 27:46.379
You took the poster down?

27:51.135 --> 27:53.435
What if they press charges against you?

27:55.758 --> 27:59.300
I know how strongly you feel, but...

28:00.083 --> 28:03.434
all this is not worth
another life destroyed.

28:03.458 --> 28:04.458
_

28:05.982 --> 28:07.324
I can't fight anymore.

28:08.947 --> 28:11.188
It's time to heal.

28:12.239 --> 28:13.879
Don't live your life in rage.

28:15.454 --> 28:16.454
Focus on...

28:17.252 --> 28:19.327
family and friends,

28:20.034 --> 28:21.034
and love.

28:22.542 --> 28:24.225
So, wherever you can find it...

28:33.558 --> 28:35.798
Yeah, I'm taking a little
break from all that.

28:37.452 --> 28:38.452
I get it.

28:46.774 --> 28:47.774
What's that?

28:49.752 --> 28:51.292
- A letter from our father.
- _

28:52.242 --> 28:53.482
From Folsom?

28:55.254 --> 28:56.771
Did you know he was in prison?

28:57.064 --> 28:58.547
- No.
- Mom never told you?

28:58.572 --> 28:59.852
No, never talked about him.

29:03.187 --> 29:04.770
I mean, why didn't she tell us?

29:04.795 --> 29:06.311
Maybe she was ashamed.

29:06.336 --> 29:07.961
Didn't want us to know.

29:08.462 --> 29:10.187
I mean, I wonder where he is?

29:10.212 --> 29:11.754
If he's still inside?

29:11.779 --> 29:13.229
Yo, who cares?

29:13.964 --> 29:15.517
He didn't ever write us any letters.

29:15.542 --> 29:16.564
That we know of.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.381
No, why you got to be
so suspicious of Mom?

29:19.415 --> 29:21.075
Obviously, he did something wrong.

29:21.404 --> 29:23.640
Okay, not every black man in
prison did something wrong.

29:23.665 --> 29:25.745
Yeah, I thought you was
taking a break from all that?

29:26.317 --> 29:29.017
Bottom line is we don't know him,

29:29.042 --> 29:30.492
and he doesn't want to know us.

29:31.178 --> 29:34.130
We don't need to go looking for
more pain and disappointment.

29:34.155 --> 29:36.115
Let's just deal with what we got to.

29:43.470 --> 29:44.946
She was so helpful.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.379
Do you wanna exchange numbers?

29:54.846 --> 29:57.247
Hi. Excuse me. Um...

29:57.272 --> 29:59.876
I was waiting for a guy who was
supposed to be in this meeting.

30:00.404 --> 30:04.905
He's, uh, tall, gaunt in the face,
but still relatively handsome.

30:05.459 --> 30:08.653
Oh, yeah, he left as soon
as the meeting started.

30:09.112 --> 30:10.403
Is he okay?

30:12.913 --> 30:13.913
Um...

30:15.428 --> 30:18.539
I already have this huge job
and now I have another one,

30:18.564 --> 30:20.138
which I'm not getting paid for.

30:20.472 --> 30:21.573
Just say no.

30:21.598 --> 30:23.673
Look, I can't. It's important.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.571
And now that I'm getting
my app developed,

30:25.596 --> 30:27.717
I can't make it look like
I'm out for just myself.

30:28.780 --> 30:32.532
Besides, if I ask the fight
club girls to join the committee,

30:32.557 --> 30:35.475
maybe they won't be so mad that
I asked two men to be on my team.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.323
Nice angle.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.780
Hey, have you ever
had sex at work before?

30:40.917 --> 30:42.457
Apparently, it's a thing.

30:43.316 --> 30:44.316
Really?

30:46.078 --> 30:47.598
I think we're the only ones here.

30:48.757 --> 30:50.397
Yeah, and I saw Evan leave.

31:07.016 --> 31:09.599
Dennis? Dennis!

31:11.252 --> 31:13.037
You scared the crap out of me! Again.

31:13.062 --> 31:15.138
I am sorry. I did not
know you were coming back.

31:15.163 --> 31:16.441
Yeah, well, you're an ass!

31:16.466 --> 31:18.577
Davia, I appreciate everything
you are trying to do,

31:18.602 --> 31:20.236
but you are suffocating me.

31:20.775 --> 31:22.409
You can't save me.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.980
I'm not trying to save you.

31:26.170 --> 31:28.451
I'm trying to get you
to want to save yourself!

31:29.841 --> 31:32.675
You know, and you're right.
I, I can't do that either.

31:32.700 --> 31:36.370
But no matter what you think,
you cannot do this all alone.

31:37.116 --> 31:38.507
And it doesn't have to be me,

31:38.639 --> 31:41.048
but you need to find
somebody who will help you.

31:42.499 --> 31:44.832
You know, maybe that's why
your marriage fell apart.

31:44.857 --> 31:47.397
You know, maybe you shut your
wife out? I don't, I don't know,

31:48.349 --> 31:51.869
but it is so messed up to think
your life only matters to you.

32:06.904 --> 32:09.964
You're a shitty husband!
And a shitty father!

32:10.550 --> 32:12.380
You know, maybe that's
why your marriage fell apart.

32:12.404 --> 32:14.444
Daddy, will you come lie down with me?

32:14.469 --> 32:15.693
I can't. I'm working.

32:15.718 --> 32:16.963
Jacob had to get cancer

32:16.987 --> 32:18.594
for you to pay any attention to him.

32:18.619 --> 32:21.831
- Daddy, please.
- Jacob, dammit! I said go back to bed.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.198
It is so messed up

32:23.541 --> 32:26.421
to think that your life
only matters to you.

32:32.721 --> 32:35.146
Hey, did you have a chance to
get that stuff for me today?

32:35.171 --> 32:36.755
Actually, I never made it out.

32:37.476 --> 32:38.792
I'll do it tomorrow. Sorry.

32:39.752 --> 32:41.702
Too busy day-drinking with Malika.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.965
I'm not your personal assistant.

32:44.990 --> 32:47.370
Okay, well, have you been
getting your unemployment checks?

32:48.550 --> 32:50.092
- No.
- Why not?

32:52.149 --> 32:56.009
Because I'm not eligible
for unemployment.

32:56.735 --> 32:57.975
And what about you?

32:58.488 --> 32:59.854
What should I do about you, Callie?

32:59.878 --> 33:00.991
How should I hold you accountable?

33:01.015 --> 33:02.295
You should probably fire me.

33:07.877 --> 33:09.117
I probably should.

33:14.442 --> 33:15.442
I'm not going to.

33:19.448 --> 33:21.723
I believe in your character, Callie.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.762
However, it is well for
the heart to be naive

33:25.787 --> 33:27.381
and for the mind not to be.

33:28.232 --> 33:30.575
You need to learn that, before
you leave this clerkship.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.920
My job is to prepare
you for the real world.

33:37.467 --> 33:41.577
If it's naive to believe
that social justice

33:41.602 --> 33:45.578
is more than an ideal,
that it's attainable,

33:46.097 --> 33:49.314
then I would rather be naive
in heart and mind, Your Honor.

33:51.554 --> 33:53.447
I'm grateful that you hired me

33:54.347 --> 33:57.040
and that you believe in my character,

33:57.758 --> 34:00.958
but this was out of character for me.

34:02.148 --> 34:05.858
To apply for a clerkship with any judge,

34:05.883 --> 34:08.558
cause I am not interested
in interpreting the law,

34:08.583 --> 34:12.275
I want to work to change
it and make it better.

34:12.301 --> 34:14.341
Now. Not nine months from now.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.487
Thank you for this opportunity.

34:22.167 --> 34:24.327
But with all due respect,
Your Honor, I have to quit.

34:40.195 --> 34:41.594
Wait, you quit?

34:41.620 --> 34:43.998
I couldn't work as a clerk anymore.

34:44.023 --> 34:45.498
Not in that environment.

34:45.695 --> 34:48.246
Okay, well, my work environment
isn't great, but I didn't quit.

34:48.272 --> 34:49.893
No, cause you're
passionate about your app,

34:49.917 --> 34:51.288
and you're doing
something you believe in.

34:51.312 --> 34:53.687
Yeah, and because I
thought you were fired,

34:53.712 --> 34:55.187
and someone has to pay the rent.

34:55.358 --> 34:56.458
You don't have to worry.

34:56.483 --> 34:57.584
Okay, I'm going to get a great job

34:57.608 --> 34:59.611
and I will pay you back every penny.

34:59.636 --> 35:03.196
Will anyone hire you if they find
out that you quit your clerkship?

35:03.823 --> 35:06.303
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth.

35:09.109 --> 35:10.962
But I know I did the right thing.

35:11.829 --> 35:13.069
I believe in myself.

35:16.639 --> 35:17.679
I believe in you too,

35:20.255 --> 35:22.824
and it's okay. You don't
have to pay me back.

35:23.252 --> 35:26.353
We're family and I know that
you would do the same for me.

35:27.729 --> 35:28.969
Yeah, I don't know about that.

35:30.437 --> 35:33.996
Mm-mm, no, no, no...
Truce, truce, truce.

35:40.124 --> 35:41.140
What're you doing?

35:42.128 --> 35:43.394
Paying our bills.

35:44.418 --> 35:45.510
Thank you!

36:02.119 --> 36:03.319
Can I stay with you tonight?

36:05.422 --> 36:06.422
Yeah.

36:20.292 --> 36:21.884
I am so sorry,

36:22.988 --> 36:25.188
but I never thought
you would leave Lily.

36:31.974 --> 36:33.214
It's okay.

36:35.699 --> 36:36.939
I understand.

36:41.011 --> 36:42.119
I'll move to L.A.

36:42.745 --> 36:44.745
I can get work to transfer me here.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.647
But you love Fitchburg.

36:47.824 --> 36:50.650
I... I love you more.

37:35.598 --> 37:38.290
- Angela, can I speak with you?
- Yeah.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.035
- In private?
- Sure.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.952
How about an implicit bias workshop?

37:46.977 --> 37:48.635
Ooh, uh, and sexual harassment.

37:48.854 --> 37:51.722
And an effort to put more
women in leadership positions.

37:51.747 --> 37:54.072
You know, and as to the
sexual harassment concerns,

37:54.097 --> 37:56.474
I think we should implement
a rule that supervisors

37:56.499 --> 37:58.777
cannot date anyone who works under them,

37:58.901 --> 38:00.261
or on their team.

38:00.286 --> 38:01.395
Agreed.

38:01.420 --> 38:03.441
It'd be good for the guys to
know that's not on the table.

38:03.465 --> 38:05.465
Avoid a lot of awkward situations.

38:06.723 --> 38:07.723
Mariana?

38:11.099 --> 38:12.819
Yeah, of course. Agreed.

38:18.099 --> 38:21.099
_

38:30.623 --> 38:32.623
_

38:33.006 --> 38:34.486
It's open!

38:42.728 --> 38:43.968
Do I know you?

38:47.206 --> 38:48.366
I think I'm your daughter.

39:00.390 --> 39:03.890
_

39:07.195 --> 39:09.395
_

39:14.555 --> 39:16.830
So, it's not on your resume,

39:16.855 --> 39:19.257
but I, I did a little
asking around about you

39:19.282 --> 39:23.434
and I found out that you were
clerking for Judge Curtis Wilson

39:23.459 --> 39:25.375
for just a few months?

39:25.400 --> 39:26.400
What happened there?

39:28.123 --> 39:30.728
I thought I might have
a progressive influence

39:30.753 --> 39:32.299
on a conservative judge,

39:32.324 --> 39:35.885
and when I realized that
wasn't possible, I quit.

39:35.910 --> 39:37.480
See, I want to change the system,

39:37.505 --> 39:40.689
and I didn't see any reason
to waste another nine months

39:40.714 --> 39:43.034
just for the cachet on my resume.

39:46.740 --> 39:47.938
I think that's bad ass.

39:49.501 --> 39:51.681
I think you'd fit in perfectly here.

39:56.106 --> 39:58.632
Now, that is a power suit.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.817
You are going to blow
them away at your new job.

40:04.839 --> 40:06.639
I haven't gotten the job yet,

40:07.522 --> 40:09.442
but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get it.

40:17.109 --> 40:21.109
_

40:21.134 --> 40:22.804
In those most vulnerable moments,

40:22.829 --> 40:23.949
who do you want to call?

40:32.850 --> 40:33.850
Come in.

40:47.317 --> 40:48.625
I didn't pass the bar.
