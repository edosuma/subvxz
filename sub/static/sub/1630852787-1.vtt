01:00.810 --> 01:06.608
<i>Rain clouds from the west brought rain</i>
<i>or snow overnight.</i>

01:06.941 --> 01:08.443
<i>But from the morning...</i>

01:08.526 --> 01:12.113
<i>Shouldn't we solve the problem?</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:18.787
<i>Watch the traffic and drive safely.</i>

01:18.870 --> 01:22.957
<i>Here's a story we've received.</i>
<i>"I dream of flying in space..."</i>

01:36.888 --> 01:37.847
Mommy!

01:42.101 --> 01:43.102
Mommy!

02:00.787 --> 02:01.996
Hello.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.501
How may I help you?

02:11.005 --> 02:17.345
Well, it's not me but my wife...

02:18.012 --> 02:20.348
Then she has to come herself.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.395
I'd like more information first.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.363
<i>A-yeong.</i>

02:36.239 --> 02:37.490
<i>What are you doing, babe?</i>

02:38.449 --> 02:40.577
He's stressing me out.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.955
-Maybe he likes you.
-Isn't he divorced?

02:44.289 --> 02:46.875
-He has a kid.
-What a nightmare.

02:47.542 --> 02:51.296
What a comfortable life.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.172
She'll hear you.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.842
I'm just jealous.

02:55.925 --> 02:59.137
I wish I could drink coffee and rest
on my husband's paycheck.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.472
Then find a husband.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.808
That's insane.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.437
I hate work. Should I get married?

03:07.520 --> 03:08.605
How about Mr. Kim?

03:12.775 --> 03:15.361
Mommy!

03:16.070 --> 03:17.947
A-yeong, Mommy's coming.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.492
Mommy!

03:21.576 --> 03:22.994
-A-yeong!
-Mommy!

03:23.995 --> 03:26.372
-Mommy!
-Say "ah"!

03:27.248 --> 03:30.501
Swallow. That's it. Good girl!

03:31.210 --> 03:32.253
Daddy's here!

03:32.337 --> 03:33.838
-Daddy?
-Yes!

03:33.922 --> 03:36.132
-Let's wash up quickly.
-Okay.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.720
I came home early to do it.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.722
Thanks. You must be hungry.

03:43.389 --> 03:46.226
-I'll do it.
-Thanks.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.186
Daddy's here!

03:49.562 --> 03:51.105
-Want me to bathe you?
-Okay.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.537
-I forgot your soup.
-It's okay. Just eat.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.957
Hands together.

04:09.999 --> 04:10.875
There.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.005
Your wrist hasn't feeling any better?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.882
It's because I use it a lot.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.593
Know what's upsetting?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.595
The doctor asked

04:22.679 --> 04:26.808
why it hurts when machines
make rice and do the laundry.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.351
What?

04:28.434 --> 04:31.354
Work didn't get easier
with electronic approvals.

04:31.938 --> 04:32.939
Exactly.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.316
I get upset about everything these days.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.276
It's weird.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.820
That's not weird.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.739
How can you ask
a sick person why she's sick?

04:51.749 --> 04:52.917
At New Year's...

04:54.168 --> 04:55.044
How about traveling?

04:56.421 --> 04:57.922
Let's not go to our families.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.757
Or how about just resting at home?

05:00.341 --> 05:01.634
I'm really tired these days.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.594
Your mother would be furious.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.097
And I do all the work, not you.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.474
We can go next time.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.728
I'm too tired to drive
all the way to Busan.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.146
The traffic will be nuts.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.275
You're too late.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.569
-What?
-When we first got married,

05:20.486 --> 05:22.905
I said going down
for your parents' birthdays

05:22.989 --> 05:24.574
and major holidays was tough.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.786
But you said that's only a few times
a year and we should go.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.330
Why change now?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.956
I went down even at full term.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.419
If we don't go, who'll be blamed?

05:37.253 --> 05:39.630
Not their precious son, but me.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.806
Good girl!

05:49.474 --> 05:51.601
<i>It's the first day</i>
<i>of the New Year holiday.</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:56.230
<i>There are less gridlocks</i>
<i>compared to other years.</i>

05:56.314 --> 06:00.485
<i>As the holiday is five days long,</i>
<i>traffic appears to be dispersed.</i>

06:00.818 --> 06:04.655
<i>Highway tolls are waived</i>
<i>this year as well.</i>

06:04.739 --> 06:06.866
Finish up and let's start
making dumplings.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.409
Yes, Mother.

06:08.951 --> 06:12.121
Why so much? Are we selling dumplings?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.956
Who'll eat all that?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.917
What's wrong with you?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.628
They have great take-out food these days.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.129
I heard it's delicious.

06:20.713 --> 06:25.051
Why order food for your family
to eat together like this once a year?

06:25.384 --> 06:27.261
Well, it's a lot of work.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.013
Be honest.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.515
Are you worrying about me?

06:36.020 --> 06:37.522
Look at all the dishes!

06:43.778 --> 06:45.988
-It's okay, I'll do it.
-Just go.

06:46.072 --> 06:50.493
My son is a modern husband.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.787
I do it all at home, Mother.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.039
I didn't say anything.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.500
Why question me complimenting my son?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.502
That's not what I meant.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.548
If you had another son,
you could've worked less.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.676
Why didn't you try harder with Dad?

07:08.136 --> 07:11.264
Go at it day and night, you know?

07:12.557 --> 07:13.724
Are you crazy?

07:15.893 --> 07:17.019
A-yeong.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.688
Want an uncle?

07:20.731 --> 07:21.941
Cut it out!

07:22.567 --> 07:24.152
What's with you two?

07:55.057 --> 07:56.142
Mother?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.644
Why not sleep more?

08:00.229 --> 08:01.272
I'm wide awake.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.655
Do you want all this spinach to be boiled?

08:09.739 --> 08:10.573
-Yes.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.368
Wait! I have something for you.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.500
I hope you like it.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.084
What's this, Mother?

08:22.960 --> 08:25.087
BUSAN BANK

08:32.178 --> 08:34.597
Mother, it's so pretty!

08:35.139 --> 08:36.682
-Isn't it?
-Yes.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.058
You like flowers, right?

08:38.392 --> 08:40.227
-Yes.
-I stood in line for hours

08:40.311 --> 08:41.145
to get it for you.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.730
Thank you.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.589
It's your friend, Pororo!

09:21.018 --> 09:22.478
Don't like it? Okay.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.690
You don't like it?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.984
See this, Grandpa?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.403
I packed everything.
Let's go once you're done.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.612
Okay. I'll hurry.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.036
Mother! We're here!

09:39.120 --> 09:40.162
Let's go inside.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.831
-My son-in-law!
-Grandma!

09:42.540 --> 09:43.916
Don't run.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.545
We bought this on the way. Isn't it cool?

09:47.628 --> 09:49.630
-It's very cool!
-Hi, you're here.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.300
Still here, Ji-young?
I was worried you'd be gone.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.094
Of course, they're still here!

09:55.177 --> 09:58.306
What's New Year's without seeing family?

09:58.389 --> 10:01.642
A-yeong! My niece!

10:02.101 --> 10:07.148
Ta-da! Isn't it pretty? Look!

10:07.481 --> 10:08.774
When did you buy that?

10:09.317 --> 10:15.239
Anything for my little niece.
I bought this, too!

10:15.823 --> 10:18.868
-Isn't it cute?
-So pretty!

10:18.993 --> 10:20.620
-Daughters are the best!
-Right.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.913
She's so pretty!

10:22.997 --> 10:28.085
Lucky you, A-yeong.
Auntie bought you pretty dresses!

10:28.169 --> 10:29.503
Right!

10:31.088 --> 10:33.299
-Yes, Mother!
-My granddaughter is the best!

10:33.382 --> 10:37.553
-So pretty.
-She's so cute.

10:37.637 --> 10:42.099
-That's great.
-It's good to be home.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.809
It was hard in my in-laws'.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.103
Right. Poor thing.

10:46.562 --> 10:50.566
Will you bring some food and dessert over?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.777
I can get it myself, Mom.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.112
Don't bother. You worked at your in-laws'.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.449
Ji-young! Go rest if you're tired, too!

11:01.869 --> 11:03.788
-Isn't it cute?
-It's perfect!

11:05.331 --> 11:07.083
She's a princess!

11:09.794 --> 11:11.712
The pin is pretty, too.

11:14.298 --> 11:18.386
-So pretty.
-Of course!

11:19.220 --> 11:21.472
Mom, be honest. Is it me or Dae-hyeon?

11:21.555 --> 11:22.681
Don't ask that.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.561
-Buy me some clothes, too.
-Really?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.271
Mrs. Jeong.

11:33.776 --> 11:37.488
If you want Ji-young to rest,
send her home.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.199
Think about it.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.327
You're happy to see your daughter.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.831
I miss my daughter, too.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.543
What's she saying?

11:51.127 --> 11:55.840
My daughter should've left
before yours came.

11:57.508 --> 12:01.971
Why make Ji-young serve
your daughter, too?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.391
Ji-young? What's wrong with you?

12:06.308 --> 12:07.143
Mr. Jeong.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.479
My daughter means the world to me.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.693
She's not feeling well.
I'll explain later.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.587
I need to use the bathroom.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.630
Is the rest stop far away?

12:38.757 --> 12:40.426
I'll stop at the next one.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.890
Sis, Ji-young is a bit...

12:48.893 --> 12:50.311
No, she's not well at all.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.023
Make sure Mom doesn't call Ji-young.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.274
<i>Okay.</i>

12:56.984 --> 12:59.653
<i>How can this happen?</i>

13:00.404 --> 13:01.739
<i>Anything I can do to help?</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:03.491
No.

13:05.242 --> 13:07.036
Just don't let Mom call her.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.163
<i>Okay, I'll make sure.</i>

13:10.122 --> 13:14.585
<i>We should've paid</i>
<i>more attention to Ji-young.</i>

13:14.668 --> 13:17.213
It's okay. I gotta go.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.380
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

13:24.220 --> 13:25.804
How much longer?

13:26.430 --> 13:27.890
Mom must be waiting.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.395
You must be tired. Should we go next time?

13:34.063 --> 13:35.564
No. I want to see Mom.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.540
Good girl, A-yeong.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.250
Did you miss Granny?

13:57.086 --> 14:00.130
Eun-yeong? Bring Dae-hyeon a drink.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.674
Ji-seok.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.926
What? Mom told you to do it.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.678
I'll get it myself.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.179
It's okay. I'll get it.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.639
Ji-seok!

14:08.722 --> 14:10.432
Kim Eun-yeong!

14:12.518 --> 14:16.105
Dae-hyeon? Do you know how hard it is
to live as a man in this house?

14:16.188 --> 14:21.318
Hey! Think of all the benefits
you got since the '80s.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.363
Right. I raised my precious son well.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.448
Please stay out of it, Dad.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.830
By the way, why isn't Ji-young waking up?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.333
-She must be tired.
-Really?

14:36.417 --> 14:37.626
Again, A-yeong.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.559
Sis! Our country is so small!

14:54.226 --> 14:56.770
The world is really big, huh?

14:56.854 --> 14:59.523
-Wanna mark off where we want to visit?
-Sure.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.358
-Get the stickers.
-Okay!

15:03.402 --> 15:04.945
What color do you want?

15:05.029 --> 15:07.948
-I'll take green.
-Then I'll take purple.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.743
I choose America!

15:10.826 --> 15:12.953
-And you?
-Me?

15:13.662 --> 15:14.580
Sweden.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.790
Denmark.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.626
Finland.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.045
Why go to such unfamiliar countries?

15:21.670 --> 15:23.547
Because not many Koreans are there.

15:23.672 --> 15:24.757
What do you mean?

15:25.799 --> 15:27.009
Forget it!

15:27.968 --> 15:29.011
Stop it!

15:29.803 --> 15:30.763
-Stop it!
-Hey!

15:31.639 --> 15:32.890
Cut the racket!

15:33.682 --> 15:37.227
Why are you girls acting up
when we just moved here?

15:37.311 --> 15:40.731
Girls must always be
quiet and calm, you know?

15:41.190 --> 15:44.693
Come out and help your mom set the table.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.537
Grandma!

15:55.621 --> 16:00.084
She ate my candy and put germs on it!

16:03.587 --> 16:04.421
So?

16:05.089 --> 16:06.715
How was the wedding?

16:07.841 --> 16:11.804
The usual, I guess.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.474
He was sad you couldn't come.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.644
You'll see your brother, right?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.483
If everyone's living well, it's all good.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.277
Mi-suk.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.572
When you worked hard
to support your brothers' studies--

16:30.656 --> 16:31.615
Stop!

16:34.118 --> 16:35.327
That's enough, Mom.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.291
Have lunch and go back.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.044
Ji-young! Eun-yeong!

16:44.128 --> 16:46.338
-Set the table!
-Okay!

16:49.675 --> 16:50.968
Mrs. Kim.

16:51.051 --> 16:54.805
Congratulations on the new house.
I enjoyed my stay for a few days.

16:54.888 --> 16:59.643
I'm living well thanks to my second son.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.729
I'm proud of my son-in-law, too.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.191
Please have some. Let's eat!

17:06.608 --> 17:11.780
There should be at least
four sons in a family.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.992
I wish Mi-suk could have another son.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.871
I'm saying it for your own good.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.665
Just having Ji-seok...

17:23.666 --> 17:25.169
It's not enough.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.252
Grandma?

17:26.336 --> 17:30.132
Your other sons won't see you.
Why insist on sons?

17:30.549 --> 17:33.510
Watch what you say.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.388
Who does she get her feistiness from?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.766
I'm going to treat Mom well.

17:39.016 --> 17:43.479
Listen to the girls speak their minds.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.732
When you grow up and get married,

17:46.815 --> 17:48.358
you'll forget about us.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.778
No, I won't.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.989
Ji-young. Eat lots.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.837
Are you ready to go to Germany
as an exchange teacher?

18:08.921 --> 18:13.634
Worrying about Kim Eun-yeong
is a waste of time.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.677
Everyone's here?

18:18.138 --> 18:19.306
Is today a special day?

18:20.516 --> 18:23.811
Ji-young must still be sleepy.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.313
-She must've been tired.
-Yeah.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.440
Ji-seok? This pen...

18:29.441 --> 18:30.734
Where'd you find that?

18:30.818 --> 18:31.944
Under your desk.

18:32.528 --> 18:38.534
Isn't that the pen Dad only bought
for Ji-seok during his trip to London?

18:38.617 --> 18:42.496
You just gave us sketchbooks.
Remember, Dad?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.623
Not that again.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.340
Dae-hyeon.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.675
Watch out for Kim Ji-young.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.844
She's persistent.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.138
She begged me for over 10 years
for that pen.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.015
You're even worse
for not giving it to her.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.315
-Honey, isn't it weird?
-What?

19:11.441 --> 19:15.362
Why didn't your mother
pack us any food this time?

19:19.366 --> 19:21.994
I said I wouldn't take any. I had enough.

19:22.619 --> 19:23.620
Really?

19:24.288 --> 19:25.497
I don't remember that.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.417
I'm so forgetful these days.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.879
You can become forgetful
after giving birth.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.593
Someone on our team had a baby recently.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.679
His wife has postpartum depression.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.597
Really?

19:41.680 --> 19:42.890
I heard it's serious.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.350
It shouldn't be overlooked.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.853
It sounds scary. I saw it on the news.

19:51.815 --> 19:52.816
Are you all right?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.277
Me? Well...

19:56.195 --> 19:57.196
I'm fine.

20:00.324 --> 20:03.202
Sometimes, I think about the past

20:03.285 --> 20:05.829
and get a sinking feeling at sundown.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.456
But it's not often.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.253
Do you want to see a psychiatrist, too?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.339
Why? You think I'm crazy?

20:15.422 --> 20:18.050
Who says that these days?

20:18.133 --> 20:20.636
Many of my co-workers
seek psychological care.

20:20.719 --> 20:26.141
Maybe talking to a psychiatrist
can stop potential depression.

20:29.937 --> 20:30.938
Should I try going?

20:32.564 --> 20:34.358
And ask why I get sinking feelings?

20:35.317 --> 20:36.610
Right.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.780
I heard of a good psychiatrist.
Try seeing her.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.782
I'll give you her number. Okay?

20:53.585 --> 20:56.213
I can't breathe.
What's with you these days?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.298
Mommy!

21:42.301 --> 21:43.635
Mommy!

21:43.719 --> 21:45.053
-Good morning!
-Hi!

21:45.595 --> 21:47.306
I'm not the first customer, right?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.766
Who cares about that these days?

21:49.850 --> 21:52.019
Women are always the first customers here.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.770
Right.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.772
-Dad? I'll take this.
-Okay.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.524
-Take care.
-Bye!

21:58.400 --> 22:01.945
-I heard she got a job.
-Yes. I'm so proud.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.840
DAEHAN PLANNING TEAM SELECTION

22:36.480 --> 22:37.939
The planning team has been selected.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.816
-Did you see it?
-Yes.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.946
Good morning.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.241
-Congratulations.
-Pardon?

22:48.366 --> 22:51.119
-You made the planning team.
-Congratulations.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.122
I don't want to go there.

22:54.289 --> 22:57.667
You should be thankful
Chief Kim chose you.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.419
She only picked guys.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.005
But Chief Kim is tough.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.633
She's tough as nails.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.843
She returned to work
a month after giving birth.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.261
Who watches her kid?

23:08.345 --> 23:10.055
Her mother lives with her.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.642
Isn't her husband amazing?

23:14.309 --> 23:15.227
Hold on.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.688
Her mother raises her kid.
What's amazing about her husband?

23:18.772 --> 23:21.399
Living with the wife's parents
is worse than the husband's parents.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.692
-What?
-What?

23:25.070 --> 23:26.696
Get ready for the meeting.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.406
Yes, ma'am.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.331
All done? Director Yang is here.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.208
Already?

23:38.291 --> 23:39.709
He's talking with Chief Kim.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.294
Take this.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.305
Why not play off the Beijing Olympics?

23:52.722 --> 23:54.933
How about a sports star
like Park Tae-hwan?

23:56.518 --> 23:58.728
Too expensive, right?

24:02.023 --> 24:04.484
Chief Kim, isn't your son his age?

24:05.026 --> 24:06.862
No, he's in middle school.

24:07.070 --> 24:07.988
Middle school?

24:08.446 --> 24:10.782
What a headache!

24:10.866 --> 24:13.118
It'll hit you soon.

24:13.827 --> 24:17.622
Kids who aren't raised by their moms
tend to be more rebellious.

24:17.706 --> 24:21.251
My mom takes good care of him.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.211
Grandmothers are not the same.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.755
Kids need their moms at home.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.550
Or something is bound
to go wrong later on.

24:29.342 --> 24:32.512
Who cares about success
if you fail at raising your kid?

24:33.263 --> 24:34.264
I'm so worried.

24:38.059 --> 24:40.687
Why not use that in the advertisement?

24:40.770 --> 24:44.357
Vitamins for children
not raised by their mothers.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.651
Prepared with a motherly heart.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.155
Then we'll get hit by working mothers.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.407
Then you should be hit by me, too.

24:56.703 --> 25:00.582
Chief? Isn't that a bit much?

25:06.004 --> 25:09.507
What did I say, Chief Kim?

25:12.385 --> 25:13.929
You scared me.

25:15.472 --> 25:18.225
This is how Chief Kim
has survived this far.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.061
It's too bad.

25:21.978 --> 25:24.064
You should've been born a man, right?

25:26.691 --> 25:27.859
Director...

25:30.612 --> 25:33.114
-Shall we start the meeting?
-Sure!

25:36.660 --> 25:43.416
Our campaign strategy is to heighten
digital media exposure.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.878
Currently, digital media advertising
is around 10 percent.

25:46.962 --> 25:51.841
We plan to increase it to 30 percent
and promote more participation.

25:54.177 --> 25:57.055
Did you see Chief Kim
against Director Yang?

25:57.138 --> 25:58.223
She's so tough.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.892
She's too strong. You're so dead.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.520
I was worried Director Yang would flip.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.981
Then you should be hit by me, too.

26:07.315 --> 26:09.609
Shall we start the meeting?

26:09.693 --> 26:11.027
-Sure!
-Sure!

26:17.492 --> 26:19.995
Ms. Kim Ji-young?
Could you come to my room?

26:20.829 --> 26:21.871
Sure.

26:32.549 --> 26:33.508
Here.

26:34.592 --> 26:37.637
Great selection of articles
and appropriate comments.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.015
I sent it to reporters
without making any changes.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.516
Keep up the good work.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.019
-Thank you.
-You may go.

26:45.937 --> 26:49.065
Anything I can improve upon?

26:49.149 --> 26:51.192
No. I called to compliment you.

27:02.912 --> 27:03.747
What?

27:04.539 --> 27:07.042
I thought you didn't like me.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.379
Because of the planning team?

27:12.213 --> 27:13.048
Yes.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.842
Why didn't you take me on your team?

27:20.722 --> 27:22.432
It's not because you're lacking
in some way.

27:23.016 --> 27:26.144
The company wants
a long-term team of over five years.

27:26.603 --> 27:30.648
It's hard for female workers
with marriage and parenting.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.735
Even if I took you on,
it would've been hard on you.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.987
I know I can do the job well.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.741
Ji-young? Do I look happy?

27:40.658 --> 27:41.493
Yes.

27:43.119 --> 27:44.287
You think so?

27:45.205 --> 27:47.916
I fall short on being a good mom.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.752
And I gave up on being
a good wife or daughter long ago.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.003
Still, you're amazing.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.882
I can work well even after marriage
and having a kid like you.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.719
-Shoes off.
-There you go.

27:59.844 --> 28:00.887
Bye-bye!

28:01.971 --> 28:03.139
Bye-bye!

28:03.807 --> 28:05.225
-Wanna come over?
-Really?

28:05.308 --> 28:07.685
Then let's invite
Eun-su and Su-bin's moms, too.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.150
Ji-young?

28:15.110 --> 28:18.947
We're having tea at my house.
You should come with us.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.242
But I have something to do.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.619
Are you working?

28:27.288 --> 28:29.499
-Yeong-ho is so good!
-Oh, please.

28:29.582 --> 28:32.627
-Make him a teen idol.
-No way!

28:32.710 --> 28:33.837
What are you doing?

28:34.546 --> 28:35.672
Come and have a seat.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.216
-You have an older child?
-Pardon?

28:40.343 --> 28:42.303
That book is mine.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.430
I see.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.557
-Come and sit here.
-Join us.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.059
You solve them for hours?

28:48.143 --> 28:53.773
It's strange, but I feel at ease
when I solve math problems.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.316
Oh my.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.278
She majored in engineering
at Seoul National University.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.779
Wow!

29:00.530 --> 29:02.490
I don't know why I studied so hard.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.492
To teach multiplication to Yeong-ho?

29:05.744 --> 29:06.786
-That's why!
-Yes!

29:06.870 --> 29:09.038
-Now, I get it.
-Good!

29:09.330 --> 29:11.541
What did you major in?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.419
-Korean literature.
-Wow.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.296
-Wow.
-Are you an author?

29:16.379 --> 29:21.342
No. I dreamed of it once,
but I worked at a marketing company.

29:22.051 --> 29:23.219
I see.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.388
What did you major in again?

29:25.472 --> 29:29.768
I majored in acting
to read books to Bo-ram.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.060
Right.

29:31.603 --> 29:35.857
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all?

29:35.940 --> 29:37.650
Snow White?

29:37.734 --> 29:39.235
I'll kill her!

29:39.319 --> 29:42.280
-How does Bo-ram respond to that?
-She cries.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.825
But that actually felt good.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.874
PART-TIME CASHIER WANTED

30:05.261 --> 30:08.431
It's good to work in the mornings
while the kids are at school.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.643
I'd keep working here
if I didn't have to move.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.853
It's easy to watch the counter.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.439
I see.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.074
Hi, Hye-su.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.953
Sure! Come over.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.539
A-yeong is so cute!

30:32.622 --> 30:34.123
She speaks well now.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.668
Already? Is she gifted?

30:36.751 --> 30:38.503
No, she's not.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.673
I think she takes after Dae-hyeon's
good language skills.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.509
Right. He talks a lot.

30:48.596 --> 30:51.391
She's so cute.

30:55.019 --> 30:59.065
Why does Dae-hyeon look so good
when you're withering?

30:59.399 --> 31:02.861
It's hard on him, too. He helps out a lot.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.737
Of course he should help!

31:06.364 --> 31:07.615
Right.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.910
Wait! Big news.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.371
Chief Kim is quitting.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.207
-Why?
-She's done with the company.

31:16.457 --> 31:19.335
Who cares if she's good?
She can't go any higher.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.713
She's setting up her own company.

31:22.005 --> 31:25.341
She rounded up the marketing team.
Mi-jeong is joining her.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.384
What about you?

31:27.594 --> 31:29.178
I got promoted recently.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.180
So I'll stay for a bit.

31:31.264 --> 31:33.766
Congratulations!

31:33.850 --> 31:35.852
No need.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.771
The men who started out with me
were all promoted last year.

31:39.188 --> 31:41.107
Thinking about it makes me so mad!

31:42.984 --> 31:44.152
Still, I'm jealous.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.869
Give Chief Kim a call.

31:53.703 --> 31:55.413
-Me?
-Yes!

31:55.830 --> 31:56.706
Go back to work.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.666
I can't.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.795
I can do part-time jobs,
but not a full-time career.

32:04.005 --> 32:08.259
Fine. Don't. Raise A-yeong well.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.094
That's an amazing job, too.

32:11.137 --> 32:16.517
You're like a queen, and I'm a maid.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.312
I'll work all my life and then die.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.233
Not funny? I said I'm a maid.

32:24.984 --> 32:25.902
It's funny.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.654
Then laugh, will you?

32:28.363 --> 32:30.531
You're funny!

32:34.953 --> 32:37.080
JOB SEARCH KOREA

32:37.163 --> 32:39.999
NO JOB MATCH

33:02.021 --> 33:03.481
Bye!

33:04.816 --> 33:06.275
Ms. Kim...

33:08.486 --> 33:09.737
Are you all right?

33:10.446 --> 33:13.950
-I thought I was late and ran.
-I see.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.160
A-yeong!

33:20.081 --> 33:22.166
POSSESSED

33:22.959 --> 33:25.128
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION

33:30.049 --> 33:32.260
I SOMETIMES GET DAZED
FROM POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION

33:34.971 --> 33:37.015
I GOT OVER IT WITH EXERCISE

33:42.145 --> 33:43.438
POSSESSED

33:45.398 --> 33:47.734
MY WIFE SEEMS TO BE POSSESSED

33:54.657 --> 33:57.410
HUSBANDS MUST PRAY MORE

34:06.836 --> 34:08.755
Everything tastes bad.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.007
Isn't it hot?

34:11.090 --> 34:12.007
What's that?

34:14.135 --> 34:15.094
Look.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.179
What are you watching?

34:19.348 --> 34:20.266
It's nothing.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.228
Bye.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.402
What was it?

34:32.487 --> 34:33.780
It's obvious.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.616
They make chat rooms
and share dirty pictures.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.824
They're animals.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.661
-So pathetic.
-I'm jealous.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.539
What?

34:43.915 --> 34:49.212
I mean I'm jealous they have time
to do pathetic things.

34:49.962 --> 34:55.009
When I go home my kids want to play,
my wife is stressed out.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.677
I'm losing my mind.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.847
I'm so depressed.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.683
I think I should see a shrink.

35:05.436 --> 35:09.065
Seeing a psychiatrist
would help with depression, right?

35:09.649 --> 35:12.944
Life's hard for you, too?
Let's go together.

35:13.027 --> 35:16.656
You should try it.
You don't look good these days.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.950
No, it's not me.

35:20.618 --> 35:25.790
My friend's wife sometimes talks
as if she's someone else.

35:25.873 --> 35:28.918
What? Is she possessed?

35:29.001 --> 35:30.586
I don't think so.

35:30.670 --> 35:31.879
Then she's crazy.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.675
Does she know she's like that?

35:36.759 --> 35:39.804
-I don't think he told her.
-Why not?

35:43.182 --> 35:44.517
He's scared.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.310
Of course.

35:46.394 --> 35:50.064
-She could get worse if she knows.
-Right.

35:50.439 --> 35:52.358
Living with her must be a horror.

35:52.775 --> 35:57.113
What if she turns into a shaman
and runs around with a knife?

35:57.196 --> 35:59.991
-He's bound to get stabbed.
-That's freaky.

36:00.408 --> 36:04.829
Crazy women like her should be isolated.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.584
Sorry. I thought I finished it.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.503
What's with him?

36:51.292 --> 36:52.376
What?

36:56.547 --> 36:59.217
Wanna work out at a gym?

37:01.135 --> 37:02.845
I donâ€™t have time for that.

37:03.262 --> 37:06.432
Exercise makes you
feel healthier and better.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.187
Honey.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.149
Should I work at a bakery?
The one down the street?

37:17.735 --> 37:18.736
Is that what you want?

37:18.945 --> 37:20.488
-Huh?
-Ji-young.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.657
Not when you're...

37:24.200 --> 37:27.411
It's hard enough raising A-yeong.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.789
-It would just be in the morning.
-Don't do it.

37:29.872 --> 37:32.416
-It doesn't sound hard.
-Who told you to work part-time?

37:48.766 --> 37:49.934
Ji-young...

37:52.853 --> 37:53.688
Ji-young.

37:54.563 --> 37:56.691
I hate that you can't do what you want.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.567
I can't watch you work
where you don't want to.

37:58.859 --> 38:00.528
I know things are hard for you.

38:01.737 --> 38:02.613
I just--

38:02.697 --> 38:07.285
Thanks a lot for knowing things are hard.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.520
You're drinking?

38:50.119 --> 38:51.495
Are you mad?

38:53.873 --> 38:55.583
You hate drinking.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.717
Are you that angry?

39:05.593 --> 39:06.761
I'm sorry.

39:06.844 --> 39:07.845
Jeong Dae-hyeon.

39:12.141 --> 39:14.185
It must be hard for Ji-young these days.

39:15.436 --> 39:19.023
She may be comfortable,
but she's also worried and impatient.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.526
Please say "You're doing great,"
"You're working hard,"

39:22.610 --> 39:24.653
and "Thank you" to her often.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.908
-Ji-young...
-I know you love your wife.

39:28.991 --> 39:30.701
Stop saying her name.

39:31.660 --> 39:32.828
Don't do this.

39:35.039 --> 39:39.085
Still think I'm the 20-year-old
Cha Seung-yeon who had a crush on you?

39:40.669 --> 39:42.254
Stupid.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.350
<i>Seung-yeon was my college classmate.</i>

39:55.976 --> 39:58.604
She was in Ji-young's climbing club.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.483
Ji-young was really close with her.

40:03.359 --> 40:05.694
She died while giving birth.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.697
Ji-young took it hard.

40:09.949 --> 40:14.703
She was devastated...
Could that be the reason?

40:15.496 --> 40:17.581
I need to meet her directly.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.312
Really, honey?

40:40.855 --> 40:42.815
You sure I didn't drink?

40:43.566 --> 40:44.525
Yes.

40:44.733 --> 40:45.860
Really?

40:46.527 --> 40:49.071
There was a beer can by my head.

40:49.196 --> 40:50.948
I tasted it in my mouth.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.992
Why can't I remember?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.953
So go see the psychiatrist today. Okay?

40:57.413 --> 40:58.581
Fine. I will.

40:58.664 --> 41:01.250
-Promise?
-Yes. You'll be late.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.796
-Promise!
-Okay!

41:18.767 --> 41:21.562
PSYCHIATRIST

41:44.835 --> 41:45.961
Hi, Ji-young.

41:46.587 --> 41:49.340
-Are you at the shop?
<i>-Of course.</i>

41:49.673 --> 41:52.301
-Is A-yeong at daycare?
<i>-Yes.</i>

41:52.801 --> 41:54.929
-But--
<i>-25,000 won, please.</i>

41:55.012 --> 41:56.180
<i>Would you like a receipt?</i>

41:56.514 --> 41:58.265
Hold on a second.

41:58.557 --> 42:00.017
<i>Thank you.</i>

42:01.477 --> 42:05.481
I'm busy right now.
Let's talk later, okay?

42:05.564 --> 42:06.482
Wait.

42:06.982 --> 42:08.275
<i>Are you coming this weekend?</i>

42:08.609 --> 42:11.987
Of course I am,
but Dae-hyeon has a workshop.

42:12.404 --> 42:13.614
I heard.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.366
Welcome.

42:15.699 --> 42:17.034
I'd better go.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.225
-Fill out all this?
-Yes.

42:42.851 --> 42:43.894
I see.

42:44.853 --> 42:48.065
How much does the examination cost?

42:48.691 --> 42:51.485
We'll run three tests.

42:51.819 --> 42:54.613
They'll cost 350,000 won in total.

43:00.035 --> 43:01.161
So I just left.

43:04.707 --> 43:05.791
What?

43:08.002 --> 43:10.921
Why? You registered to see her.

43:11.005 --> 43:14.758
The examinations cost way too much.
I'm not that bad.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.051
Ji-young, you're...

43:22.224 --> 43:23.100
Honey.

43:24.476 --> 43:25.811
Do I talk in my sleep?

43:26.228 --> 43:28.188
Why do you insist
that I see a psychiatrist?

43:28.939 --> 43:33.360
Well, you say you forget things

43:33.694 --> 43:34.737
and have a sinking feeling.

43:35.529 --> 43:38.949
Women become forgetful after giving birth.

43:39.033 --> 43:42.286
And the sinking feeling is nothing.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.330
Don't worry. I'm fine.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.780
CHIEF KIM

44:22.493 --> 44:23.410
Hi, Ji-young.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.913
Can I ask you something?

44:26.288 --> 44:27.456
What is it?

44:27.539 --> 44:29.708
Is Chief Kim's number the same?

44:29.792 --> 44:30.834
Yes.

44:32.836 --> 44:35.839
-She's here. Wanna talk to her?
-I can't.

44:35.923 --> 44:37.883
No, it's okay. Talk to you later.

44:38.717 --> 44:40.052
-Okay, bye.
-Fine.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.680
Wait a minute. I'm coming.

44:51.563 --> 44:54.066
Don't use the third floor bathroom.

44:54.149 --> 44:56.360
Why not? Tell me.

44:56.443 --> 44:58.278
Just listen and don't go!

44:58.362 --> 45:02.449
You have to tell me why.
If not, I'm going.

45:03.242 --> 45:06.120
Damn it...

45:13.001 --> 45:14.086
Excuse me.

45:19.383 --> 45:20.884
-What?
-Got any pads?

45:21.510 --> 45:22.428
Yes.

45:24.847 --> 45:27.683
Third floor is out of order.
Go somewhere else.

45:28.225 --> 45:31.353
What? I was just there.

45:32.020 --> 45:36.984
-Wait.
-What's wrong? Are you sick?

46:06.054 --> 46:07.097
Girls!

46:14.688 --> 46:16.648
A security guard set up a hidden camera?

46:16.899 --> 46:19.109
-Yes.
-What happened to him?

46:19.193 --> 46:21.445
He'll be indicted no matter what.

46:21.987 --> 46:23.489
But Manager Oh makes me so mad.

46:24.364 --> 46:27.117
If he saw the pictures online
and knew it was our company,

46:27.201 --> 46:28.744
he should've reported it.

46:28.827 --> 46:32.998
How can he share it
with other male co-workers?

46:34.166 --> 46:35.250
That's crazy.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.419
I only used the third floor bathroom.

46:39.213 --> 46:43.967
I dread going to the police tomorrow
to verify the pictures.

46:44.801 --> 46:47.221
They try to console us,

46:48.222 --> 46:52.309
but I wonder if they saw my butt, too,
and get so mad.

46:52.392 --> 46:54.144
I don't believe this.

46:54.436 --> 46:58.273
Make sure you check
all bathrooms from now on.

46:58.565 --> 47:00.234
Look for any holes.

47:01.235 --> 47:03.111
What if I'm in a rush?

47:04.821 --> 47:07.866
-A bedpan?
-We can't carry that around!

47:08.575 --> 47:10.786
Got any of A-yeong's diapers on you?

48:10.512 --> 48:12.806
Are you all right?

48:13.432 --> 48:14.766
Would you like to sit?

48:15.892 --> 48:17.102
No, thank you.

48:33.452 --> 48:37.706
DAD, IT'S JI-YOUNG.
COME TO THE BUS STOP. HURRY!

48:46.506 --> 48:47.549
Hey!

48:53.513 --> 48:56.391
Didn't you hear me?

48:59.061 --> 49:00.145
Excuse me!

49:00.646 --> 49:01.980
Young lady!

49:02.981 --> 49:05.651
-You left this on the bus!
-Damn it.

49:09.488 --> 49:10.989
Oh dear.

49:11.490 --> 49:13.575
You must've been scared.

49:13.950 --> 49:15.702
It's okay now.

49:20.082 --> 49:23.627
-Ji-young!
-Dad!

49:23.710 --> 49:27.130
-What's wrong?
-It's okay now.

49:31.968 --> 49:35.555
Why go to a tutoring school so far away?

49:37.140 --> 49:38.350
Look for a new school.

49:42.979 --> 49:46.441
Dress properly. Your skirt is too short.

49:47.526 --> 49:50.070
And don't just smile at anyone.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.989
I didn't! I don't even remember.

49:54.116 --> 49:57.994
Why don't you remember?
You should be careful.

49:58.078 --> 49:59.830
Stay alert and avoid problems.

50:00.247 --> 50:02.874
If a rock rolls toward you,
will you stand still?

50:02.958 --> 50:05.377
If you don't avoid it, it's your fault.

50:06.336 --> 50:07.379
Understood?

50:17.764 --> 50:19.099
Are you all right?

50:22.477 --> 50:23.645
Yes.

50:47.794 --> 50:48.670
Ji-young?

51:01.141 --> 51:02.642
It's you, isn't it?

51:06.396 --> 51:07.564
What do you mean?

51:14.905 --> 51:15.864
What's with you?

51:16.615 --> 51:17.616
Are you okay?

51:24.498 --> 51:25.332
Mom!

51:33.882 --> 51:38.303
I don't get it.
How can you just leave like that?

51:46.228 --> 51:47.646
What in the world?

51:49.898 --> 51:51.566
She has what?

51:54.194 --> 51:55.403
I'm sorry.

51:56.279 --> 51:59.950
Why in the world would you be sorry?

52:06.665 --> 52:08.625
I gotta go back to work.

52:10.377 --> 52:12.337
I'm going back home, too.

52:13.046 --> 52:16.174
Stop by my house.
Just don't say anything to Ji-young.

52:16.758 --> 52:19.010
How can I pretend I don't know?

52:20.762 --> 52:22.597
I can't lie like that.

52:24.891 --> 52:25.976
Are you all right?

52:26.935 --> 52:28.061
I'm okay.

52:29.145 --> 52:33.733
So peculiar. Why can't she...

52:36.486 --> 52:38.154
Oh my...

52:51.251 --> 52:52.335
Hello, Mother.

52:52.419 --> 52:54.880
<i>I'm in Seoul right now.</i>

52:54.963 --> 52:55.922
You are?

52:56.006 --> 52:58.884
I came to see someone,
and now I have to go back.

53:00.051 --> 53:02.387
<i>Why didn't you stop by here?</i>

53:03.013 --> 53:05.432
I have an appointment back home.

53:05.515 --> 53:09.978
Anyway, I know a great oriental clinic.

53:10.061 --> 53:12.647
I'll send some herbal tonics.
Make sure you drink them.

53:13.189 --> 53:15.567
I should get it for you.

53:16.151 --> 53:17.819
Eat well.

53:17.903 --> 53:21.031
If you don't, your body will grow weak.

53:21.114 --> 53:24.200
-I will.
<i>-I'd better go. Bye.</i>

53:24.284 --> 53:25.410
Bye.

53:34.127 --> 53:36.129
Where's the blue T-shirt?

53:36.630 --> 53:38.173
It's hanging in the closet.

53:39.215 --> 53:40.300
To the left.

53:48.433 --> 53:50.060
Too bad your workshop is today.

53:51.311 --> 53:52.395
Should I skip it?

53:52.479 --> 53:53.438
No.

54:00.028 --> 54:02.072
Take a cab there. Promise me you will.

54:03.031 --> 54:05.116
If you get tired, call me.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.910
Then will you come to help?

54:08.787 --> 54:10.872
Just go. You'll be late.

54:14.542 --> 54:15.543
Bye.

54:16.795 --> 54:19.965
A-yeong? Daddy has to go.
Bye-bye! Kiss-kiss! Blow a kiss!

54:47.450 --> 54:49.828
Looks like she pooped.

54:55.333 --> 54:56.793
I'm sorry.

54:58.712 --> 54:59.587
A-yeong!

55:00.338 --> 55:05.510
I'm almost done. Hold on.

55:07.637 --> 55:11.558
There! Let's go to Granny's.

55:14.769 --> 55:17.897
Wait. Mommy has to pee.

55:57.103 --> 55:58.730
Mommy peed, too.

56:03.151 --> 56:04.360
Close the lid.

56:36.267 --> 56:38.394
Your teacher writes neatly.

56:39.479 --> 56:41.898
I wanted to be a teacher, too.

56:46.319 --> 56:47.654
It's true.

56:48.238 --> 56:52.659
I studied the best out of all my siblings.

56:53.034 --> 56:54.953
Even better than your first uncle.

56:58.540 --> 57:01.459
Then why didn't you become a teacher?

57:04.087 --> 57:07.090
Because I had to earn money
for my brothers to go to school.

57:07.715 --> 57:09.634
How did you earn money?

57:12.512 --> 57:16.558
I made clothes at a factory.

57:22.105 --> 57:27.652
It's okay.
Women lived like that back then.

57:29.404 --> 57:32.449
Then why not become a teacher now?

57:32.824 --> 57:38.246
I'm your mother now.
I have to raise you kids.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.957
You can't because of me?

57:51.843 --> 57:52.844
Mom.

57:53.761 --> 57:54.804
Did you sleep well?

57:58.391 --> 57:59.726
Has your birthday soup been made?

58:00.185 --> 58:01.144
I can make it.

58:01.227 --> 58:02.687
No, it's okay.

58:03.271 --> 58:05.482
Go to Mommy, A-yeong.

58:06.691 --> 58:10.778
Eun-yeong insisted
that I don't do anything.

58:11.696 --> 58:13.656
As if she can cook...

58:14.157 --> 58:16.242
She'll probably buy all the food.

58:17.243 --> 58:20.205
She called Ji-seok to go out and help her.

58:20.288 --> 58:21.498
Where's Dad?

58:21.831 --> 58:24.250
He went to pick up his sisters.

58:27.253 --> 58:29.672
It must've been hard
coming here by yourself.

58:30.173 --> 58:31.466
She pooped on the way.

58:32.967 --> 58:36.971
You did, A-yeong?

58:39.933 --> 58:40.975
That's enough now.

58:42.352 --> 58:46.481
"I just tapped your butt
because you're like my daughter."

58:46.981 --> 58:48.024
Or

58:48.107 --> 58:53.154
"I touched your six-pack
because you're like my brother."

58:53.238 --> 58:54.989
"What's the big deal?"

58:57.283 --> 59:04.165
They're not your daughter or brother.
It's sexual harassment.

59:04.249 --> 59:08.962
You could end up in handcuffs.

59:16.511 --> 59:19.889
Why do they give lectures like that?

59:19.973 --> 59:21.891
What's the use?

59:21.975 --> 59:24.561
It's for you to listen to.

59:24.644 --> 59:28.856
Watch how you treat female staff members.
Times have changed.

59:28.940 --> 59:30.191
Why you!

59:32.151 --> 59:34.070
I should've been born
in the Joseon dynasty.

59:35.863 --> 59:37.323
Come at once!

59:37.699 --> 59:39.158
Leave at once!

59:40.868 --> 59:43.371
There's so much to worry about.

59:43.496 --> 59:46.291
Let's go with the flow.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.752
I thought of my wife and got sad.

59:51.337 --> 59:56.342
Should I just take paternity leave
like she wants?

59:56.426 --> 59:57.719
Paternity leave?

59:57.802 --> 01:00:01.472
My wife asked me to look into it.

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:06.227
Or she'll go and work even if
all her salary goes to a babysitter.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.688
Try it if you want.

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.524
But you could end up like
Park in marketing.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.694
When you return, your desk will be gone.

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:16.487
He got fired?

01:00:17.071 --> 01:00:18.448
They won't say that.

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:22.910
But those who go on paternity leave
are promoted later

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:26.080
and struggle to settle back
in the company.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:31.002
What the hell am I supposed to do?

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:37.091
Wow!

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:40.178
It's beautiful!

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:44.724
Thank you.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.809
-How is it?
-It's pretty.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:50.813
We should wear elegant things like this.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.857
-You're right.
-Yes!

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.151
It should be more colorful.

01:00:55.234 --> 01:00:58.154
-I love it.
-Whatever.

01:00:58.237 --> 01:00:59.572
Ji-young?

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:03.785
Though it's hard raising a kid,
you should dress up and stuff.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:05.953
Beauty is key to women.

01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.165
-I'm pretty as is.
-Whatever.

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:10.917
You look washed-out.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.669
Isn't Ji-seok home?

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:15.963
Right. Where did he go?

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.840
Here he comes.

01:01:18.883 --> 01:01:19.926
Here.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:22.470
Hello.

01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:25.056
-What's all this?
-Hi.

01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:28.226
You made all that food, Eun-yeong?

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.562
I can't cook.
I ordered it from a good restaurant.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.231
For what?

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:36.359
Your mom could've just
whipped up a few dishes.

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:40.154
Mom always cooks a feast
on Dad's birthday.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:44.075
Wouldn't it suck for Mom
to cook for her own birthday party?

01:01:44.158 --> 01:01:46.452
Right! You're the best.

01:01:48.913 --> 01:01:50.289
Ji-seok! Come here.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.878
Your daughters are peculiar.

01:01:55.962 --> 01:02:00.925
Why make your young brother
carry all the food?

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.596
He's not young! He's over 30.

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:10.768
He'll always be your younger brother.
Treat him well.

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:16.232
-But Auntie--
-I wish I had a daughter, too!

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:18.818
They care more for their family.

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.194
Good girl!

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.532
Thanks.

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:28.244
Aren't you getting married?

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:30.121
Auntie! Stop it.

01:02:32.039 --> 01:02:35.168
Must seem nice now, but what about later?

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:38.838
If she's able to live alone, why not?

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:42.675
Able or not, I'll be fine on my own.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:46.471
You are so different!

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.973
That's true.

01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:50.141
Mom!

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:56.355
I just mean that you're extra special.

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:00.985
-Take out the tables.
-Okay.

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:06.908
-Ji-seok!
-What?

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.413
-What?
-Use your head.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:14.373
I am!

01:03:15.249 --> 01:03:18.252
-Why you!
-Silly kids.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:26.886
It's always exhilarating
to see our eldest aunt, huh?

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:30.932
Why did Dad invite them?

01:03:31.015 --> 01:03:34.268
You didn't lose once to her.
Aren't you tired?

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:35.645
Is that coffee?

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:40.441
Iâ€™m exhausted. Still, I have to fight.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:44.862
Is there a game character
that gains more energy as it's hit?

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:48.407
I'll tell them to make
a character like you.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:53.830
It'd be cool to have people
hit you like this.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:56.499
-Ouch!
-Why you!

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.629
Look at Ji-seok's face.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:03.840
He looks so funny.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.967
What? I look cute.

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:10.012
I miss Grandma.

01:04:10.721 --> 01:04:13.432
Grandma spoiled you big time.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:16.185
She favored Ji-seok.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.856
Still, he grew up to be a decent guy.

01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:21.566
You're popular, right?

01:04:22.066 --> 01:04:23.401
A little.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:26.821
-Bow down.
-What?

01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:30.324
I practically raised you, so bow.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:31.993
Bow!

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:33.744
Why you!

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.498
That hurts, Kim Eun-yeong!

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.376
-Kids! Your aunts are leaving!
-Look at this.

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:42.628
-Coming!
-Okay.

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:47.133
-Hey!
-Oh no!

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:50.803
I kicked him hard,
and he dropped to his knees.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.889
-Sis...
-Please, Kim Eun-yeong.

01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:55.808
Watch it. You could get hurt.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.103
I don't want to see you on the news.

01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:01.272
Are you worried about me?

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:04.567
No need to worry.

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:06.736
I can hold my own against jerks like that.

01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:10.865
True. Back in high school,
you and your friends caught a flasher.

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:12.992
Right!

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:15.912
I caught him and turned him over
to the police.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:19.916
But my teachers yelled at me
and called us shameless girls.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:26.213
I cursed those teachers back then,
but I became one.

01:05:26.797 --> 01:05:28.633
You didn't want to be a teacher?

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:29.592
What?

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:34.347
Mom said you chose teachers college
because of us and cried.

01:05:34.472 --> 01:05:35.348
Really?

01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:43.898
Dad lost his job in the recession,
and you guys were young.

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:46.108
It was the right choice.

01:05:46.692 --> 01:05:48.653
Sorry, because of Ji-seok and I...

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.489
What's with you?

01:05:53.407 --> 01:05:57.036
You wanted to be an author,
but got a marketing job instead.

01:05:57.703 --> 01:05:59.789
We can make little concessions.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:02.416
You have matured.

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:06.796
Nope. I have rice cake.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:09.256
-How childish!
-How childish!

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.182
Your students hate you, right?

01:06:18.265 --> 01:06:21.268
No! I'm totally popular.

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:24.271
Who is it?

01:06:28.192 --> 01:06:29.652
What's that look?

01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:31.153
Got a boyfriend?

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.864
Sis! Stop it!

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.119
How have you been?

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.704
Good. How about you?

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:24.749
-Fine.
-How's everything?

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.376
Isn't your daughter
about two years old now?

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.503
She's 26 months old.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:33.424
Though it's hard to raise kids,
they're cute, huh?

01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:35.092
Yes.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.471
-Chief.
-Hmm?

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.766
Were you surprised when I texted you?

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:55.696
Join us.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:07:59.366
-Me?
-Yes.

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:01.494
It's the same as
working at Daehan Planning.

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:04.705
But I can only pay you 80 percent
of what you were making before.

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:07.083
Still, I'll make sure you get incentives.

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:12.922
Do you think I can do a good job?
I haven't worked for a few years.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.258
Since when did you become a worrywart?

01:08:18.844 --> 01:08:21.013
Do you not like our company
because it's small?

01:08:21.846 --> 01:08:25.267
No way! I'm just thankful
you still want me.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.228
Let's work together.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.688
Great. Thank you.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.234
I'll do my best.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.737
For Ji-young's graduation,

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:42.827
should I close the shop
or just open at night?

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:44.495
Whatever.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:47.540
I'm not going. I didn't even get a job.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:52.419
You'll regret not having
a graduation picture later.

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.630
Forget it. I won't regret it!

01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:56.381
-Ji-young!
-Enough!

01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:58.551
Then stop everything!

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:02.595
Just stay home till you get married.
That suits you!

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:15.609
What in the world do you mean?

01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:19.654
How can you say something so archaic!

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:22.116
Don't stay still, Ji-young!

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:24.493
Act up! Do what you want!

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:25.618
Okay?

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:27.872
Got that?

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.130
Jeez.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:39.300
-Why you...
-Water!

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:42.136
-That's gross!
-That's gross!

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.430
Oh dear!

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:45.639
I'm not eating.

01:09:45.805 --> 01:09:47.892
Just pick it off.

01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:57.443
Hello?

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:00.988
Daehan Planning?

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:03.240
Yes.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:06.744
I see.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:08.621
Bye.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.213
Mom! I got the job!

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:18.756
-Really?
-Yes!

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.635
Way to go!

01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:25.846
Sis! I got the job!

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.516
Way to go!

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.644
-Dad.
-Well done!

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:33.270
Let's eat.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:34.980
Keep eating.

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:37.608
Have some meat.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:40.736
Eat up.

01:10:41.695 --> 01:10:45.491
I met Chief Kim and talked about
going back to work.

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:47.868
<i>Good! But is it possible for you?</i>

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:49.245
I'll make it possible.

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:51.538
<i>Of course! Good luck!</i>

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:52.998
Thanks.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.903
It's not my birthday today.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:23.904
What is it?

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.156
Honey, I got a job!

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:44.883
So we'll have to send A-yeong
to daycare all day?

01:11:45.092 --> 01:11:48.429
It'll be too hard on her
to stay till the evening at daycare.

01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:50.055
I asked other moms.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:54.059
It's good to find a babysitter
for 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. instead.

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:55.477
I see.

01:11:56.270 --> 01:12:00.149
I also put her on a waiting list
for a babysitting service.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.234
Good.

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:07.614
Honey.

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:11.827
Do you not want me to work again?

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.039
It's not that.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.208
I'm just worried it'll be hard
on you and A-yeong.

01:12:19.793 --> 01:12:21.003
Then should I not do it?

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.131
No.

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:26.592
I'm happy if you're happy.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:39.146
Ji-young.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.566
Honey!

01:12:43.942 --> 01:12:45.277
Knock, knock.

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:53.786
Are you mad?

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.162
Yes, I am.

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:57.790
Don't mind what they said.

01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:02.711
I'm hungry. Feed me, baby!

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:04.129
Stop it!

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:08.634
Why must we talk about having kids
in front of your parents like that?

01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:12.012
Parents just say things like that
in passing.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.223
They nag at you to get married,

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:15.974
and when you do,
they tell you to have kids.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:18.102
If we have a son,
they'll say to have a daughter.

01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:20.437
If we have a daughter,
they'll say to have a son.

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:23.857
I have a great idea.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.401
What is it?

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:26.735
First, let's eat.

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.070
Tell me. What is it?

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.076
Instead of being nagged by my parents,

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.536
let's have a baby.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:36.787
What?

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:39.665
Let's just have one. I'll be good.

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:43.669
We're not talking about buying
watermelons or oranges here!

01:13:44.711 --> 01:13:48.048
We're going to have one anyway,
so let's just have one soon.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:50.801
Having a baby won't change things
that much.

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:53.262
You really think so?

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:57.266
I'll do my best to help!

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.685
Jeez.

01:14:00.185 --> 01:14:02.354
I'll change the diapers and feed the baby.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.190
Everything will change for me.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:06.692
But what about you?

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:07.609
Me?

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.779
It'll change for me, too.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.282
I'll have to come home earlier.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.409
I won't be able to drink or meet friends.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.334
If the baby looked like you,
it would be so cute.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.837
Stop! I'm depressed.

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:28.964
It's because you're hungry.

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:31.008
Make me food, please?

01:14:31.508 --> 01:14:33.469
I'm seriously depressed!

01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:40.642
Want me to make you happy?

01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:44.062
Cut it out!

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.357
Honey! Are you okay?

01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:51.778
-How's your back?
-Let's test it out!

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:55.449
Have my baby, please!

01:14:56.116 --> 01:14:59.286
-Let's do it!
-Stop it!

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.833
Damn it.

01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:07.836
She's still not here?

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:09.963
It appears that way, sir.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:13.509
She used to do everything perfectly.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.637
She's been a wreck since she's been back.

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:19.389
Here she comes.

01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:26.647
I'm sorry.
He's too sick for daycare today.

01:15:28.148 --> 01:15:31.818
Bring me the industry trend report
I asked for yesterday.

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:33.320
Yes, sir.

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:35.405
What's this?

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:39.243
Mommy told you to be quiet.

01:16:00.472 --> 01:16:04.226
BABYSITTER NEEDED URGENTLY

01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:10.148
You have to learn to pee
in the potty, okay?

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.149
Watch this.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.693
Bye-bye, diapers!

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:14.695
Try it, A-yeong.

01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:17.406
Bye-bye, diapers!

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:18.615
Bye!

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:20.409
BABYSITTER NEEDED URGENTLY

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:23.412
HOPE YOU FIND ONE

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:25.581
WHAT'S THE RATE FOR
BABYSITTERS THESE DAYS?

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.045
I didn't get any calls.

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.798
Really? Not even one?

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:38.385
No. I don't think it'll work.

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.848
No replies from job sites, either.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.812
Let's get dressed, A-yeong.

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:58.447
Should I take paternity leave?

01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:01.783
What?

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:05.579
I could watch her for a year,
then go back.

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:09.791
Maybe she'll be okay to stay
all day at daycare next year.

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:13.837
We'll find a way till she goes to school.

01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:16.131
Your company is okay with it?

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:18.425
It's available to request.

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:21.928
Don't worry and do what you want.

01:17:22.846 --> 01:17:25.891
I'll read books and study while I'm at it.

01:17:27.267 --> 01:17:28.226
Honey!

01:17:28.852 --> 01:17:30.187
Baby!

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:32.105
You love me more now, don't you?

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:34.441
I'm more dashing by the day, huh?

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:38.654
A-yeong! Mommy's going back to work!

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:42.115
-Give me a high-five!
-High-five!

01:17:42.199 --> 01:17:43.617
Good girl!

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:56.046
<i>WRITING GOOD REPORTS</i>

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:07.099
PACKAGE LEFT AT DOOR

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.479
Black goat?

01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:18.944
Keep playing. I'm calling Grandma.

01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:23.073
Hi.

01:18:23.573 --> 01:18:25.200
<i>The herbal tonic came today.</i>

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:26.618
Good.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:29.663
<i>I'll drink it and work hard at my company.</i>

01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:32.624
What company?

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.626
You're going back to work?

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.629
My former boss called me to work for her.

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:40.882
What do you mean?

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:44.344
Paternity leave?

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:45.637
Yes.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:48.890
<i>How could you do this to him?</i>

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:53.061
-I can explain--
-Don't hinder his career! Use your head!

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:56.314
<i>-Mother--</i>
-I don't want to hear it. I'm hanging up!

01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:11.663
Hello, Mrs. Jeong.

01:19:12.497 --> 01:19:15.751
<i>How much would a child's mother make?</i>

01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:21.923
<i>If she wants to work,</i>
<i>why not get a part-time job?</i>

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:23.717
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:29.639
How can she tell her husband
to take paternity leave?

01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:30.932
Mrs. Jeong.

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:36.521
<i>Ji-young studied a lot</i>
<i>and had a good career, too.</i>

01:19:37.397 --> 01:19:40.901
<i>She's the one who gave birth</i>
<i>and is raising A-yeong.</i>

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.361
They should take turns helping out.

01:19:43.528 --> 01:19:45.864
If she's not well, she shouldn't work!

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.200
What do you mean she's not well?

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:55.081
You must not know.
Your daughter isn't normal.

01:19:59.544 --> 01:20:01.838
<i>Didn't you hear</i>
<i>what happened on New Year's?</i>

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:21.316
Why did you tell her, Mom!

01:20:21.399 --> 01:20:26.947
<i>It's because I was frustrated</i>
<i>and worried about you.</i>

01:20:27.405 --> 01:20:29.282
<i>You can't hide it forever.</i>

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.326
Would you do that
if it were your daughter?

01:20:31.409 --> 01:20:34.120
<i>How can you say that?</i>

01:20:34.746 --> 01:20:38.834
<i>So you'll make Ji-young work</i>
<i>when she's sick?</i>

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:43.171
<i>What if she gets worse</i>
<i>while she's at work?</i>

01:20:55.767 --> 01:20:56.685
Mom.

01:20:57.477 --> 01:20:58.854
Why are you going to see Ji-young?

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:00.814
Close up shop for me.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.024
Your phone.

01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:17.539
Mother!

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.437
Ji-young.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.573
I was just thinking about you.

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:54.951
It's not true, is it?

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:56.828
What?

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:04.169
Mom? Is something wrong?

01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:09.174
It's nothing.

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:14.179
I just dropped by to see you.

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:20.435
Ji-young, be sure to eat well.

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:22.437
You have to be strong.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:28.401
I'll move near you
and watch A-yeong for you.

01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:30.278
So work.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.367
I'll help you.

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.496
Do whatever you want.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:44.834
I'll see you soon.

01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:49.506
Take care.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:52.634
Mi-suk.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.478
Don't do that.

01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:17.617
You worked to support your brothers
from a young age.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:23.581
Whenever you gave me your paychecks

01:23:24.457 --> 01:23:27.043
looking so tired and weak,

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.796
it broke Mom's heart.

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:42.726
My angelic daughter...

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.030
When you hurt your hand at work,

01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:00.201
I was devastated.

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:08.376
I'm sorry I didn't console you

01:24:09.794 --> 01:24:12.213
or thank you back then, Mi-suk.

01:24:14.924 --> 01:24:16.384
I'm so sorry.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:24.768
Ji-young will be fine on her own.

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:26.853
You raised her to be strong.

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:44.079
My poor girl.

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.419
My precious daughter...

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:55.507
My dear daughter...

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:04.933
Dae-hyeon?

01:25:05.391 --> 01:25:07.519
What happened to her?

01:25:08.853 --> 01:25:12.690
How did Ji-young get like this?

01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:18.780
Ji-young!

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:24.577
No, Ji-young! Please...

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.919
No...

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:06.619
Mom?

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.125
Is something wrong?

01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:19.007
Ji-seok got worried and called
to say something's wrong with you.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:22.468
Did something happen at Ji-young's?

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:27.182
Ji-seok!

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:37.692
-Is it medicine for Mom?
-No way. She has a different one.

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:38.693
Take it.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.989
Men should take good stuff like this.
It's yours.

01:26:54.667 --> 01:26:56.294
What's this!

01:26:57.003 --> 01:26:58.796
What the hell is this!

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.841
Is your son the only one you care about?

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.679
Ji-young is wasting away
not being able to do what she wants!

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:11.059
But you buy medicine
for your healthy son only?

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.978
-And you call yourself a father?
-What's with you?

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:17.899
Jeon's son opened a clinic,
so I bought a batch to help.

01:27:18.107 --> 01:27:19.984
Exactly!

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:27.075
Why not buy some for your daughters, too!

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:31.079
She's sick because she grew up like this!

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:40.838
My poor baby!

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.217
My poor girl!

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:51.224
Ji-young! No!

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:11.786
Hi, Jeon.

01:28:12.578 --> 01:28:16.833
I need to order another batch.

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:20.003
For my daughter.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.174
It's Sunday. Got time to meet me?

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:28.469
Of course. You're the busy one.

01:28:31.055 --> 01:28:32.432
Ji-young, are you sick?

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.143
Do I look sick?

01:28:35.518 --> 01:28:37.270
You look down.

01:28:37.687 --> 01:28:39.272
I guess I am.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.404
Hye-su.

01:28:47.238 --> 01:28:49.699
I don't think I can work
at Chief Kim's company.

01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:51.951
-Why? Because of A-yeong?
-Yes.

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:53.870
There's no one to watch her.

01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:54.996
What did Dae-hyeon say?

01:28:55.288 --> 01:28:56.998
He said he'd take paternity leave.

01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:59.083
Then you're set!

01:28:59.542 --> 01:29:01.794
But his mother is totally against it.

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:06.299
Ji-young. Isn't that unfair?

01:29:07.216 --> 01:29:10.386
You studied and worked
as much as your husband.

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:14.724
You're the one who had to give birth,
but you can share the load in raising her.

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:17.518
It's not as easy as it sounds.

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:20.313
His mother is not completely wrong.

01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:23.066
I can't earn as much as my husband.

01:29:23.649 --> 01:29:29.655
What I make may not be enough
to send A-yeong to daycare and stuff.

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:35.953
How frustrating.

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:55.223
Let's go.

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:36.722
She's asleep?

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:38.641
Yes.

01:30:39.475 --> 01:30:41.102
She's getting fussier at bedtime.

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.821
I'll meet Chief Kim and tell her

01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:55.533
that I won't be able to work.

01:30:59.036 --> 01:31:01.747
Let's keep looking for a way.

01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:03.374
There isn't a way.

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.630
I'm tired even before going back.

01:31:16.053 --> 01:31:17.638
Fine. Rest a bit more.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.641
You should rest.

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:23.269
When A-yeong is older, it'll get better.

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:26.189
Is raising kids resting?

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:30.651
I mean...

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:36.782
I know I shouldn't,
but I keep having doubts.

01:31:38.284 --> 01:31:41.829
Maybe you don't want me to work,
like your mother.

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:45.458
Maybe you regret saying
you'd take paternity leave.

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:55.718
Ji-young. That's not true.

01:31:55.801 --> 01:31:57.762
I don't mind taking paternity leave.

01:31:58.262 --> 01:31:59.764
I said it for your own good.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.350
Stop saying it's for my own good!

01:32:04.143 --> 01:32:05.895
Honestly, I don't believe it.

01:32:07.396 --> 01:32:10.942
You, Mother, and my family
are all the same!

01:32:11.317 --> 01:32:13.027
It's just war to me!

01:32:15.404 --> 01:32:19.408
Please calm down and listen carefully.

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:23.621
I told you to try going to a psychiatrist.

01:32:27.917 --> 01:32:29.043
You are...

01:32:33.589 --> 01:32:35.091
somewhat sick now.

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:41.097
What are you talking about?

01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:51.857
Does it make you feel better to say that?

01:32:55.611 --> 01:32:56.988
Where and how am I sick?

01:33:03.452 --> 01:33:05.121
Sometimes...

01:33:08.499 --> 01:33:11.085
you become someone else.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.021
<i>A-yeong!</i>

01:33:30.479 --> 01:33:31.647
<i>What are you doing, babe?</i>

01:33:31.731 --> 01:33:35.234
<i>Dae-hyeon. It's cold today.</i>

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:39.655
<i>The wind will be cold out.</i>

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:41.949
<i>Be sure to dress warmly.</i>

01:33:45.661 --> 01:33:47.580
<i>You sound exactly like your mom.</i>

01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:51.500
<i>A-yeong! Come to Granny.</i>

01:33:51.834 --> 01:33:53.085
<i>Stop joking around.</i>

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:00.486
What can I do?

01:35:03.614 --> 01:35:05.282
Can I get treated?

01:35:12.248 --> 01:35:14.875
It's good that A-yeong is still young.

01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:18.003
Or she'd know that I'm weird.

01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:22.883
You don't do it often.

01:35:24.844 --> 01:35:25.845
Just once in a while.

01:35:31.642 --> 01:35:33.477
This must've been hard for you.

01:35:35.688 --> 01:35:37.022
I was so worried...

01:35:40.526 --> 01:35:42.069
That I might lose you...

01:35:47.741 --> 01:35:53.914
That you got sick like this
because you married me.

01:36:16.061 --> 01:36:18.856
Tell her to put it
in the fridge right away.

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:20.107
-Okay.
-Here.

01:36:21.192 --> 01:36:24.236
-Make sure it doesn't spill.
-Okay.

01:36:29.533 --> 01:36:31.535
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, Ji-seok.</i>

01:36:31.744 --> 01:36:32.703
Dad?

01:36:33.579 --> 01:36:36.665
I'm going to Ji-young's
to deliver some food.

01:36:36.749 --> 01:36:37.875
Do you know...

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.836
What she likes?

01:36:41.086 --> 01:36:44.089
<i>Ji-young? Sweet red-bean bread.</i>

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:46.675
-Really?
<i>-Yes.</i>

01:36:49.345 --> 01:36:50.346
What's all this?

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:52.598
It's for you to eat.

01:36:52.765 --> 01:36:54.016
This is unexpected!

01:36:54.099 --> 01:36:56.310
You never brought anything for me before.

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:18.374
Mommy?

01:37:20.918 --> 01:37:22.127
Want some bread?

01:37:22.586 --> 01:37:23.837
She doesn't like red-bean bread.

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.506
She takes after me.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:27.967
You don't like red-bean bread?

01:37:29.051 --> 01:37:31.262
I can eat it with the red-bean out.

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:35.766
What? Dad said you like this.

01:37:35.849 --> 01:37:38.811
You like it. I like cream bread.

01:37:57.997 --> 01:37:59.164
What's this?

01:37:59.582 --> 01:38:00.624
Take it.

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:08.090
Can I really have it?

01:38:10.175 --> 01:38:12.428
Buy me a better one next time.

01:38:19.852 --> 01:38:21.520
It shows, you know.

01:38:26.275 --> 01:38:27.276
I gotta go.

01:38:29.612 --> 01:38:30.696
Bye, A-yeong.

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:36.827
-Stay for dinner!
-I can't.

01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:45.294
Don't be sick, Sis.

01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:48.922
I get to hear you call me "Sis"
because I'm sick.

01:38:55.971 --> 01:38:57.097
Thanks, Ji-seok.

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.767
I'll buy you cream bread next time.

01:39:07.524 --> 01:39:13.489
KIM JI-YOUNG

01:39:32.091 --> 01:39:34.968
-We finally meet.
-Yes.

01:39:35.511 --> 01:39:39.598
I'm the one who's sick,
but I was the last to find out.

01:39:40.015 --> 01:39:42.893
How did you feel when you heard?
Surprised?

01:39:45.854 --> 01:39:47.022
I'm scared.

01:39:47.106 --> 01:39:50.859
Know what the hardest part is
for the patients?

01:39:51.777 --> 01:39:54.530
To take the first step
and sit with me like this.

01:39:55.656 --> 01:40:01.704
Sitting here is a sign
that your treatments will be successful.

01:40:01.787 --> 01:40:05.207
I'm glad to hear that.

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:30.816
Hi, it's me.

01:40:31.775 --> 01:40:32.609
Are you at work?

01:40:33.068 --> 01:40:35.446
Yes, I just got here.

01:40:35.612 --> 01:40:39.491
-Did you have breakfast?
<i>-Yes.</i>

01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:43.287
I ate as I fed A-yeong. How about you?

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.789
<i>Your dad never misses breakfast.</i>

01:40:45.956 --> 01:40:47.875
Of course, I ate.

01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:56.675
Mom?

01:40:56.759 --> 01:40:58.010
Yes?

01:40:58.844 --> 01:41:02.347
Remember when I was born?

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.979
Of course, I do. Like it was yesterday.

01:41:10.522 --> 01:41:15.360
Cherry blossoms fell all around
on the day you were born.

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:18.906
On the way to the hospital
after my water broke,

01:41:19.198 --> 01:41:21.241
<i>it was so beautiful.</i>

01:41:21.450 --> 01:41:23.452
It looked like snow.

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:28.540
I must take after you.

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:34.838
It snowed on the day A-yeong was born.

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:37.841
And a beautiful daughter was born.

01:42:14.753 --> 01:42:16.630
CONGRATULATIONS

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:30.102
It doesn't suit her.

01:42:46.743 --> 01:42:47.786
Here.

01:42:49.454 --> 01:42:52.332
Like our company name? Spring Breeze.

01:42:52.416 --> 01:42:54.376
-Doesn't it suit me?
-Totally.

01:42:54.626 --> 01:42:56.503
You're lying. It shows.

01:42:57.504 --> 01:42:58.338
What's this for?

01:42:58.964 --> 01:43:00.132
To congratulate you.

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.342
Thank you.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.436
Why are you acting like a guest?

01:43:14.062 --> 01:43:15.522
There's no fooling you.

01:43:16.273 --> 01:43:18.358
What is it? Tell me.

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:21.361
I don't think I can work here.

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:23.238
Couldn't find a babysitter?

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:24.948
No.

01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:32.623
Then how about working part-time?

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.875
I can't do that either.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:41.048
I'm seeing a psychiatrist.

01:43:44.134 --> 01:43:48.639
Who doesn't need to seek counseling
these days?

01:43:48.972 --> 01:43:51.642
It would be risky for me to meet clients.

01:43:53.143 --> 01:43:55.520
What if I say crazy things
during meetings?

01:43:59.191 --> 01:44:02.903
When I'm well enough to work,
I'll be back.

01:44:17.501 --> 01:44:18.794
<i>Doctor?</i>

01:44:19.628 --> 01:44:22.089
<i>I don't think it's so bad</i>
<i>living like this.</i>

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:26.677
<i>As someone's mom and wife.</i>

01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:30.514
<i>Sometimes, I'm happy.</i>

01:44:31.807 --> 01:44:33.225
<i>But sometimes,</i>

01:44:34.893 --> 01:44:36.979
it feels like I'm trapped.

01:44:42.693 --> 01:44:48.281
I go around a wall to find an exit,
but there's another wall.

01:44:50.325 --> 01:44:51.994
Then another one...

01:44:55.831 --> 01:45:01.503
I think maybe there was no exit
from the start and get angry.

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.255
I see.

01:45:04.965 --> 01:45:06.466
Then I realize

01:45:10.429 --> 01:45:12.055
that it's actually all my fault.

01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:19.688
Others found the way out,
but I don't have the skills to.

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:24.985
So I fell behind.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.903
It's not your fault, Ji-young.

01:45:27.696 --> 01:45:29.781
Then why am I the only one
who's a mess like this?

01:45:33.702 --> 01:45:36.580
What did you do
when you were angry before?

01:45:59.102 --> 01:46:05.776
KIM JI-YOUNG

01:46:12.491 --> 01:46:15.202
Why are there so many women
with kids here?

01:46:15.994 --> 01:46:17.162
It's crazy.

01:46:17.245 --> 01:46:19.164
Let's go to no kids zones.

01:46:19.247 --> 01:46:21.792
There are kids everywhere.
This place is the best.

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:23.627
It sucks.

01:46:24.461 --> 01:46:26.379
-A-yeong.
-Right.

01:46:29.007 --> 01:46:30.967
-A-yeong, wait.
-What's taking so long?

01:46:31.301 --> 01:46:32.177
A-yeong!

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:34.179
Oh no.

01:46:37.182 --> 01:46:38.850
-Stay.
-What a mess.

01:46:40.352 --> 01:46:42.354
What a nuisance.

01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:43.897
Why not drink coffee at home?

01:46:45.065 --> 01:46:46.983
How can she clean that?

01:46:47.776 --> 01:46:48.902
What a vermin-like mom.

01:46:49.611 --> 01:46:50.612
She can hear you.

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:52.948
But she is shameless.

01:46:53.156 --> 01:46:55.200
What a pity.

01:46:56.868 --> 01:46:57.994
Let's drink at the park.

01:46:58.453 --> 01:47:00.247
-Isn't it cold out?
-It's better than here.

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:09.214
-It's too noisy here.
-Right.

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:10.757
Excuse me.

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.636
Do you know me?

01:47:14.803 --> 01:47:16.888
-Pardon?
-Why am I a vermin-like mom?

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:20.142
Let's just go.

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:22.269
Don't treat me like an insect.

01:47:22.686 --> 01:47:24.229
I wasn't talking about you.

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:26.022
Who were you talking about?

01:47:26.731 --> 01:47:28.817
I came to order coffee here.

01:47:29.317 --> 01:47:32.028
You saw me for less than 10 minutes.

01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:36.366
What do you know about me to insult me?

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:42.414
Do you know what I've been through,
who I know,

01:47:43.957 --> 01:47:45.917
and what I'm thinking to judge me?

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:52.716
How would you like it
if I judged you at a single glance?

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:55.468
What is she saying?

01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.554
We were just talking!

01:47:57.846 --> 01:48:00.599
Then don't let others hear you.

01:48:02.017 --> 01:48:04.561
Why are you trying so hard to hurt others?

01:48:05.478 --> 01:48:07.856
-Let's go. Just drop it.
-Hurry.

01:48:07.939 --> 01:48:11.151
-Come on.
-Let's go.

01:48:21.578 --> 01:48:24.039
Mommy!

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:30.503
Mommy!

01:48:30.587 --> 01:48:33.048
It's okay, A-yeong.

01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:34.925
I'm not crying.

01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:36.384
Mommy's strong.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.428
So don't cry, A-yeong.

01:48:39.221 --> 01:48:41.348
No more tears!

01:48:42.807 --> 01:48:43.934
Good! Let's go.

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:55.528
Did it feel satisfying?

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:57.030
No.

01:48:57.656 --> 01:48:59.991
I didn't feel satisfied or embarrassed.

01:49:01.868 --> 01:49:03.078
But...

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:11.878
It wasn't bad.

01:49:23.473 --> 01:49:25.100
Honey, it's spring.

01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:29.271
See the buds there?

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.862
Not again. What a crybaby.

01:49:40.282 --> 01:49:41.616
I'm okay.

01:49:59.843 --> 01:50:00.844
Let's go!

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:43.720
Daddy! Let's go!

01:50:45.555 --> 01:50:47.057
-Did you have fun?
-Yes!

01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:49.476
-Wanna go home?
-Okay!

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:56.441
-Are you hungry?
-Yes!

01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:58.026
What do you want?

01:50:58.151 --> 01:50:59.944
-Ice cream!
-We should eat rice.

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.863
Then rice cookies.

01:51:21.925 --> 01:51:24.719
