        - [Danny] Joni,
       I need my scrubs!

02:12.233 --> 02:14.600
      - Look on my floor.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.135
 - [Danny] They're all wrinkly.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.836
      Where are my pants?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.238
        - Oh, down here.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.511
   - [Danny] Can't you sleep
      in your own clothes?

02:25.513 --> 02:28.213
     - Everything's dirty.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.414
        - [Danny] Great.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.318
        (pager beeping)

02:33.320 --> 02:36.922
      Why are they paging
         me this early?

02:36.924 --> 02:37.756
            - Ready?

02:37.758 --> 02:38.657
            - Yeah.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.461
   She'll be here around six.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.595
         - [Joni] Yup.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.764
        - Don't be late.

02:50.437 --> 02:51.336
              Bye.

03:18.933 --> 03:19.910
    - [Crosby] Hello, Joni.

03:19.911 --> 03:20.888
         - Hey, Crosby.
        - I'm in a play

03:20.889 --> 03:21.866
 that's opening tomorrow night.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.235
  It has eight acts, each with

03:23.237 --> 03:24.336
       a different animal
          - I'm sorry.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.436
          - and theme.
    - Crosby, I'm late to--

03:25.439 --> 03:27.306
  - I get to play a dinosaur.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.407
           - Oh wow.
     - I hope you can come.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.975
       - [Joni] I'll try.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.225
        (Sumana giggles)

03:46.227 --> 03:46.925
           - Beat ya.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.328
             Joni!

03:49.330 --> 03:50.629
         Let's do this!

03:50.631 --> 03:52.464
       Monday my fun day.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.498
      - [Sumana] Why don't
    you stop having fun days

03:53.500 --> 03:54.900
   and start doing some work.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.569
        - Oh, we finally
   changin' out the turtles?

03:57.571 --> 04:01.273
     All right, all right,
    I was just testin' you.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.975
Seriously though, how you doin'?

04:02.977 --> 04:03.875
            Come on.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.644
              Mm!

04:05.646 --> 04:07.980
     ¶ Makin' me a latte ¶

04:07.982 --> 04:10.716
      I'm feelin' the love
  today, Joni, and I like it.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.485
    - Did you clean out the
 bathroom last night, Michael?

04:13.487 --> 04:15.420
       (machine whirring)

04:15.422 --> 04:16.387
          - Uh, what?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.291
       - [Joni] Nothing.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.304
  - [Michael] All right, just
   the chest, just the chest.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.006
       Mm, one more time.

04:34.008 --> 04:37.509
  Mm, all right, now a little
  harder, a little harder, mm.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.578
 All right, now jump this time.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.614
              Mm!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.649
      Yes, Jun Taek, your
       mother'd be proud.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.419
       ("Not a Sad Song")

05:12.813 --> 05:13.812
    (Danny screams happily)

05:13.814 --> 05:15.781
         (Allie laughs)

05:15.783 --> 05:18.817
        - Come here, you
     squashed cabbage leaf!

05:18.819 --> 05:19.651
         - [Allie] Hi!

05:21.989 --> 05:22.855
             - Oh!

05:22.856 --> 05:23.722
 Joni will be here any minute.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.623
            - Okay.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.334
        (phone ringing)

05:36.370 --> 05:37.069
         - Saints Rest.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.103
    - [Danny] Where are you?

05:38.105 --> 05:39.488
          She's here.

05:39.489 --> 05:40.872
      - Yeah, I just have
       a few stragglers.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.442
       - [Danny] Joni, no
      more fiddling, come.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.010
       - Yeah, okay, bye.

05:57.891 --> 05:58.790
            - Okay.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.426
       Sorry about Joni.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.761
 I guess she got stuck at work.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.497
        (phone jingling)

06:05.499 --> 06:06.765
            My mom.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.100
      (speaking in Hebrew)

06:08.102 --> 06:10.001
    You sure you don't wanna
      come sleep upstairs?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.737
      - No, no, I'm fine.

06:11.739 --> 06:12.871
       - It's your room.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.407
  - Danny, I love this couch.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.676
    - Okay, come upstairs if
  you change your mind, okay?

06:17.678 --> 06:18.694
       - [Allie] I will.

06:18.695 --> 06:19.711
          - Laila Tov
          - Laila Tov

06:19.713 --> 06:21.012
      Thanks for the cake.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.814
     - [Danny] Yeah, sure.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.538
         (Allie sighs)

08:12.726 --> 08:15.827
 - Stealing my clothes already?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.496
       - This was Mom's.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.935
  - Sorry I'm late, I just got
   caught up with something.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.003
          - It's okay.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.074
          (Joni sighs)

08:29.076 --> 08:30.709
    - How long you here for?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.111
- Um, I was hoping a few weeks.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.846
  My lease starts on the 15th.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.746
            - Right.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.984
      That should be fine.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.121
    - It's good to see you.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.023
           - You too.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.949
  - [Danny] No, put it inside

08:53.950 --> 08:56.267
   and then drink through it
    like it's a straw, see?

08:56.270 --> 08:57.650
             - Mm!
           - Uh huh.

08:57.651 --> 08:59.031
             - Mm!
      - Yeah, that's what

08:59.032 --> 09:00.412
       I'm talking about.
          - Oh my god.

09:00.413 --> 09:01.793
   (Danny and Allie laughing)

09:01.794 --> 09:03.174
   - Hey, Joni, did you know
    that Allie has an agent?

09:03.176 --> 09:04.843
     She's already getting
        other auditions.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.928
         - [Joni] Wow.

09:05.929 --> 09:07.012
         - It's mostly
      off-Broadway stuff.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.580
          - [Joni] Did
     somebody see my keys.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.981
     - Check your pockets.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.117
    You're gonna be famous,
  Allie, I know these things.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.136
   - Okay, I'm going to work,

09:14.137 --> 09:16.154
       so just call me if
       you need anything.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.606
     - Good morning, Kelly.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.575
    - [Kelly] Good morning.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.982
   - There you are, darling.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.150
          - How much?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.151
            - $3.25.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.920
      (patrons chattering)

09:48.922 --> 09:50.121
       That's fine, Mary.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.623
      - No, no, I have it.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.924
- No, this is perfect, perfect.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.225
       - Okay, thank you.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.060
            - Okay.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.661
      - You've seen this?

09:56.663 --> 09:57.762
           For real?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.265
- [Joni] Here you go, lovebirds.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.232
   - [Danny] Thank you. Okay.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.300
     - [Andrew] Thank you.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.048
 - [Jaysen] Can I get a little,

10:33.049 --> 10:34.866
   there's gonna be a little
   red barn in the background

10:34.868 --> 10:37.168
    and throw in some chicks
      and ducks and geese.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.403
             Yeah?

10:38.405 --> 10:40.739
     Really let 'em scurry.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.974
  And everybody else, I'll see
   ya tomorrow at five, okay?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.526
            - Okay.
          - Thank you.

10:44.527 --> 10:46.077
      - See you tomorrow,
     I'll see you tomorrow.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.247
      (singers chattering)

10:51.385 --> 10:51.950
       - [Man] Thank you

10:56.690 --> 10:59.958
        - Uh, what, what
      are you doing here?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.761
        (Allie chuckles)

11:05.298 --> 11:08.667
      I'm liking it, there
        are good things.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.736
      But I miss the city.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.171
      I mean, there are no
     cute boys here at all.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.974
        (Allie laughing)

11:17.310 --> 11:20.712
     - I just can't believe
     we're both back here.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.814
        We always talked
       about getting out.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.149
           - No joke.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.785
   - They still say no joke?

11:26.787 --> 11:28.286
       - Oh, absolutely.

11:31.958 --> 11:35.093
  Is being back weird for you?

11:35.095 --> 11:38.830
     - Yeah, feels like I'm
     in the Twilight Zone.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.966
     Everything is smaller.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.871
    - [Joni] So deserve it.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.874
        (Danny laughing)

11:50.777 --> 11:54.879
     - [Danny] Do you think
     Allie has a boyfriend?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.748
     - I can't even imagine
        her with a guy.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.785
      I mean, what do they
    do, sing Sondheim duets?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.390
- You should give her a chance.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.192
     She's kinda cool now.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.296
        You just haven't
      seen her in a while.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.198
     - Whose fault is that?

12:15.135 --> 12:18.269
      Spare me the guilt,
       I'm immune to it.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.375
        (Danny laughing)

12:24.377 --> 12:27.445
        (Joni chuckles)

12:27.447 --> 12:30.014
         (Danny sighs)

12:39.960 --> 12:41.526
             - Hey.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.861
         - [Joni] Hey.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.429
   - [Allie] You almost done?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.864
         - [Joni] Yeah.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.134
  - [Allie] Place looks good.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.436
      You got new chairs.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.505
       - Three years ago.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.876
 - What happened to the stage?

12:57.878 --> 12:59.010
        - People like to
      sit near the window,

12:59.012 --> 13:01.112
  watch the bustling streets.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.948
       Can you turn that
        sign to closed?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.224
   - Hey, why don't you take
     down Mom's sea turtles

13:13.226 --> 13:15.827
       and find something
         new to put up.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.395
    Make the place your own.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.396
          - Yeah, no.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.033
It's turtles all the way around.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.510
So, I have some errands to run.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.763
           I can just

13:34.764 --> 13:35.947
        - Oh, yeah, okay
       - see you at home.

13:35.949 --> 13:36.848
            - Yeah.

13:41.188 --> 13:44.088
        - [Joni] Sorry,
       I'm late, ringers.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.831
 Everyone has their gloves on?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.532
         - I hear your
     sister's back in town.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.134
      - [Joni] Yeah, just
      for a little while.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.502
    - [Mary] Oh, wonderful.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.869
      I'll bet she's glad
        to be back home.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.972
       - She is thrilled.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.208
      - [Mary] She's such
       a talented singer.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.610
    - Okay, let's start with
   This Little Light of Mine.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.146
   Everyone grab your bells.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.081
          (Joni sigh)

14:10.083 --> 14:12.483
  Okay, one, two, ready, play.

14:13.887 --> 14:17.021
      (gentle piano music)

14:40.280 --> 14:41.946
          (door slams)

14:44.317 --> 14:45.650
        - What was that?

14:45.652 --> 14:47.786
         (Allie sighs)

14:47.787 --> 14:49.921
      - It's nothing, I'm
     just trying to write.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.522
   - Will you play it for me?

14:51.524 --> 14:52.557
        (pager beeping)

14:52.559 --> 14:53.458
           Oh, sorry.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.429
        Shit, one of my
      patients is coding.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.532
    Rain check on the song?

15:01.534 --> 15:02.967
      Sorry, cabbage leaf.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.602
           Laila Tov!

15:07.440 --> 15:09.574
            ("Mask")

15:14.414 --> 15:19.484
        ¶ I wanna wear a
      mask and hide away ¶

15:20.253 --> 15:25.323
  ¶ I wanna wear a mask, just
  be someone else for a day ¶

15:28.061 --> 15:30.428
  ¶ I gotta dance all night ¶

15:30.430 --> 15:33.631
        ¶ Gotta, gotta,
      gotta move my way ¶

15:33.633 --> 15:36.701
    ¶ With the spotlight on
    me fillin' up my body ¶

15:36.703 --> 15:41.472
  ¶ Breathin' deep as I sway ¶

15:41.474 --> 15:46.544
    ¶ I lie awake tonight ¶

15:47.981 --> 15:53.051
   ¶ I'll lie awake tonight ¶

15:54.220 --> 15:56.421
 ¶ I don't want it to be done ¶

15:56.423 --> 16:00.525
      ¶ Done, done, done,
        done, and over ¶

16:00.527 --> 16:02.961
 ¶ I don't want it to be done ¶

16:02.963 --> 16:07.098
      ¶ Done, done, done,
        done, and over ¶

16:14.240 --> 16:19.310
        ¶ I wanna wear a
      mask and hide away ¶

16:20.613 --> 16:25.683
 ¶ I wanna wear a mask and dumb
   out the noise of the day ¶

16:28.121 --> 16:33.191
     ¶ And just to give you
     all the space to be ¶

16:34.094 --> 16:36.995
    ¶ I'll build you a dream
    and float you upstream ¶

16:36.997 --> 16:41.466
     ¶ And maybe you could
        finally see me ¶

16:55.115 --> 16:58.516
      (patrons chattering)

16:58.518 --> 16:59.501
             - Hey.

16:59.502 --> 17:00.485
       - Thank god you're
    here, can you take this?

17:00.487 --> 17:02.320
     Take this, take this!

17:04.057 --> 17:05.022
            - Danny!

17:05.025 --> 17:06.089
   I've been waitin' for you.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.290
  - Hey, Michael, how are you?

17:07.292 --> 17:09.761
     - I'm good, I'm good,

17:09.762 --> 17:12.230
   but your roommate's being
     a little bitch today.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.433
      - Want some coffee?

17:15.435 --> 17:16.768
        - [Danny] Yeah.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.106
       - [Michael] Allie!

17:22.108 --> 17:23.141
             - Hey!

17:23.143 --> 17:23.775
        - [Michael] Hey.

17:23.777 --> 17:24.642
          - Oh my god!
             - Wow!

17:24.644 --> 17:25.742
          Look at you.
             - Oh!

17:25.744 --> 17:27.078
            Oh, hi!

17:27.079 --> 17:28.412
  - [Michael] Joni, you didn't
 say Allie was comin' in today.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.715
             - Oh!
    - Cool Stanford apparel.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.616
           - Be nice.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.453
  - [Sumana] How the hell did
  you get a part on Broadway?

17:35.455 --> 17:36.371
       - Oh, it's just a
        supporting role.

17:36.372 --> 17:37.288
- [Sumana] Can I come with you?

17:37.290 --> 17:38.189
  Who do I have to sleep with?

17:38.191 --> 17:40.191
    - Hey, Allie, come sit.

17:42.128 --> 17:42.794
           Want some?

17:45.732 --> 17:46.781
             - No.

17:46.782 --> 17:47.831
 The place really looks great.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.802
 - [Joni] You keep saying that.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.237
- Um, I was wondering, actually,

17:53.239 --> 17:56.140
  if you have any open shifts?

17:56.142 --> 17:57.108
         - [Joni] Why?

17:57.110 --> 18:00.078
      - Well, I just have
      a lot of free time,

18:00.080 --> 18:02.580
     and I could really use
    the money for New York.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.083
 - Oh, is Manhattan expensive?

18:06.586 --> 18:09.187
      I mean, we get like
     one customer an hour.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.657
      I really don't need
        any extra help.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.392
       - It could be fun.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.227
       I mean, I haven't
       worked here since,

18:16.229 --> 18:18.796
like junior year of high school.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.632
   - I can't just create paid
    shifts out of thin air.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.602
  - [Danny] But you do have to
   fire Michael occasionally.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.237
     - I heard that, Danny.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.238
           - I know.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.139
            - Okay.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.541
        We'll see, okay?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.810
        - Morning, Joni.

18:48.811 --> 18:50.261
         - Hey, Crosby.
         - Wasn't that

18:50.262 --> 18:51.712
     some storm last night.
        - Running late.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.163
            - Yeah.
  - There was a driving wind.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.600
         (horn honking)

19:10.517 --> 19:11.482
         - Here you go.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.550
    - [Customer] Thank you.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.885
         - [Allie] Bye.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.387
  - [Danny] Allie, come here.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.162
     Do you remember this?

19:24.164 --> 19:25.547
        - [Allie] Yeah.

19:25.548 --> 19:26.931
   - [Joni] What are you guys
    getting into over there?

19:26.933 --> 19:28.599
       - Nothing, relax.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.835
     - Do you wanna try it?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.654
        - [Danny] Yeah.

19:32.655 --> 19:34.472
   - [Allie] Hey, Joni, does
     the piano still work.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.175
 - I don't know, it's a piano.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.278
      - [Allie] You play.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.379
        - [Danny] Okay.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.683
         ("Right Now")

19:49.189 --> 19:54.258
  ¶ Come and tell me a tale ¶

19:54.627 --> 19:57.528
   ¶ Of our childhood days ¶

19:57.530 --> 20:00.464
       ¶ Simple, clean ¶

20:00.466 --> 20:03.501
      ¶ Do you remember ¶

20:03.503 --> 20:05.303
     ¶ When we were kids ¶

20:05.305 --> 20:08.539
  ¶ We used to pick berries ¶

20:08.541 --> 20:12.210
¶ In the woods along the hill ¶

20:12.212 --> 20:13.444
          - Left hand.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.746
         ¶ The smell ¶

20:15.748 --> 20:19.250
 ¶ Does it remind you as well ¶

20:19.252 --> 20:24.322
    ¶ Of the times we played
    together by the stream ¶

20:24.991 --> 20:28.326
      ¶ Do you remember ¶

20:28.328 --> 20:31.495
        ¶ When we had no
       where else to go ¶

20:31.497 --> 20:33.698
  ¶ And so we took the time ¶

20:33.700 --> 20:38.769
  ¶ To sing and to daydream ¶

20:39.405 --> 20:42.473
      ¶ Running, running ¶

20:42.475 --> 20:45.409
         ¶ Through the
     never-ending fields ¶

20:45.411 --> 20:50.481
  ¶ Unaware that time exists ¶

20:51.784 --> 20:54.518
      ¶ We're not afraid ¶

20:54.520 --> 20:57.822
     ¶ To stain our clothes
      with mud and sand ¶

20:57.824 --> 21:02.260
      ¶ The present moment
        is right here ¶

21:02.262 --> 21:04.662
         ¶ Right now ¶

21:08.301 --> 21:08.966
        (both laughing)

21:08.968 --> 21:14.038
         ¶ Right now ¶

21:16.342 --> 21:21.412
  ¶ Come and tell me a tale ¶

21:21.881 --> 21:24.949
     ¶ Of the simple days ¶

21:24.951 --> 21:27.518
        ¶ By the hills ¶

21:27.520 --> 21:30.688
    ¶ I wish you knew that ¶

21:30.690 --> 21:33.991
       ¶ All your dreams
       can be fulfilled ¶

21:33.993 --> 21:39.063
   ¶ If you just follow those
  that really make you feel ¶

21:41.901 --> 21:44.769
      ¶ Running, running ¶

21:44.771 --> 21:47.872
         ¶ Through the
     never-ending fields ¶

21:47.874 --> 21:52.943
  ¶ Unaware that time exists ¶

21:54.380 --> 21:56.981
      ¶ We're not afraid ¶

21:56.983 --> 22:02.053
     ¶ To stain our clothes
      with mud and sand ¶

22:06.359 --> 22:11.429
      ¶ Running, running ¶

22:12.765 --> 22:17.835
  ¶ Unaware that time exists ¶

22:18.538 --> 22:23.607
      ¶ We're not afraid ¶

22:24.844 --> 22:29.380
      ¶ The present moment
        is right here ¶

22:29.382 --> 22:34.452
         ¶ Right now ¶

22:35.588 --> 22:37.988
         ¶ Right now ¶

22:42.362 --> 22:43.594
        (Allie laughing)

22:43.596 --> 22:45.062
    (Danny screams happily)

22:45.063 --> 22:46.529
   - Joni, did you hear that?

22:46.532 --> 22:48.699
       - Thanks for that
        rendition, guys.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.667
        (Allie laughing)

22:49.669 --> 22:50.568
      Can we go to lunch?

22:50.570 --> 22:53.404
  - Yeah, we can go to lunch.

22:53.406 --> 22:56.807
    Joni, you wrote so much
     good stuff in college.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.008
         ¶ Right now ¶

22:58.010 --> 23:00.444
   - [Joni] Shut up, shut up.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.924
 - [Allie] Joni's not back yet?

23:13.926 --> 23:16.560
     - [Danny] No, she's at
      bell choir practice.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.162
     - [Allie] She's where?

23:18.164 --> 23:19.897
      - Yeah, it's Monday.

23:21.667 --> 23:25.536
   (bells chiming peacefully)

24:33.806 --> 24:35.573
       - Wonderful, okay.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.645
    I will see you guys all
     next week, same time.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.615
              Yup.

24:44.616 --> 24:47.584
    Tyson, try not to break
   anything else. (chuckles)

24:47.587 --> 24:52.590
 - [Choir Member] I'm starved,
  let's get something to eat.

25:13.779 --> 25:16.614
- That was Mom's favorite hymn.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.521
       How long have you
        been doing this?

25:23.523 --> 25:26.257
    - They asked me to take
      over after she died.

25:26.259 --> 25:28.092
      Nepotism gone awry.

25:31.564 --> 25:34.999
   Didn't think I'd still be
  doing it three years later.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.568
    - But you always refused
    to go to church with us.

25:37.570 --> 25:41.839
   - I still get the willies
    being in here. (scoffs)

25:41.841 --> 25:43.774
  - Yeah, well, you definitely
       got the head start

25:43.776 --> 25:45.776
    railing against it all.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.214
      - Why, did you stop
        going to church?

25:50.216 --> 25:51.649
         - Pretty much.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.984
       - I feel kinda bad
      about it sometimes,

25:53.986 --> 25:57.321
      but probably not for
       the right reasons.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.192
    My therapist enjoyed it.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.661
    - You have a therapist?

26:03.663 --> 26:07.164
       - (chuckles) I had
    one, yeah, for a while.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.065
             - Why?

26:10.570 --> 26:13.304
         - That's what
     happens when everyone

26:13.305 --> 26:16.039
   pretends things are stable
    and then your mom dies.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.741
       - She didn't want
       you to see things.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.209
       - I know, I know.

26:20.079 --> 26:24.048
      You two put on quite
       covert operation.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.850
        - She wanted to
       let you get away.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.789
      - So that you could
    resent me for it later?

26:36.295 --> 26:41.332
     I wish I could've been
  there you, be sad with you.

26:42.868 --> 26:45.336
 - Yeah, you would've loved it.

26:45.338 --> 26:47.338
         (Joni laughs)

26:47.340 --> 26:48.739
Instead of going off to college,

26:48.740 --> 26:50.139
      you could've stayed
       home with me and,

26:50.142 --> 26:55.112
     eh, giving her enemas
     and shoving catheters

26:59.952 --> 27:01.852
     It's been three years.

27:04.123 --> 27:09.193
 You had three years to be sad
 with me, but you weren't here.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.201
   - Well, can I be here now?

27:23.109 --> 27:24.708
  - [Jaysen] One, two, three.

27:24.710 --> 27:27.411
     ¶ If you lived here ¶

27:27.413 --> 27:29.713
     ¶ You'd be home now ¶

27:29.715 --> 27:33.250
    ¶ And you wouldn't have
    to face the road ahead ¶

27:33.252 --> 27:34.685
         - [Jaysen] Put
       your scripts down.

     ¶ If you lived here ¶

27:36.989 --> 27:39.256
     ¶ You'd be home now ¶

27:39.258 --> 27:44.328
  ¶ With your favorite pillow
     waiting on your bed ¶

  ¶ With your favorite pillow
     waiting on your bed ¶

27:49.769 --> 27:50.551
        - [Jaysen] Woo!

27:50.552 --> 27:51.334
             - Yes!
       (singers clapping)

27:51.337 --> 27:53.704
    - Great job, great job.

27:53.706 --> 27:54.772
 That's what I'm talkin' about.

27:54.773 --> 27:55.839
        How long are we
     staying at this thing?

27:55.840 --> 27:56.906
- [Allie] You cannot abandon me.

27:56.909 --> 27:57.908
      - [Jaysen] I'm just
       here for the wine.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.376
        - And Jon's art.

27:59.377 --> 28:00.843
      - Oh, please, Jon's
     not much of an artist.

28:00.846 --> 28:01.879
             - Hey!
          - Hey, Jon!

28:01.881 --> 28:03.847
- Get over here, give me a hug!

28:03.849 --> 28:04.682
        Let's get drunk!

28:04.684 --> 28:05.749
       - Oh, how are you?

28:05.751 --> 28:06.717
         - How are you?

28:06.719 --> 28:07.752
     How the hell are you?

28:07.753 --> 28:08.786
         - [Allie] I'm
      great, how are you?

28:08.788 --> 28:09.870
     - I'm good, I'm good.

28:09.871 --> 28:10.953
 Apart from living in shit box

28:10.956 --> 28:13.290
         and working at
    Walmart, I'm fantastic.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.425
        - Jon, you don't
        work at Walmart.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.143
          - Yes, I do.

28:16.144 --> 28:17.860
   You need a drink, and you
 need to take your glasses off.

28:17.863 --> 28:18.996
       No nerds allowed.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.264
        This is America.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.732
    - Okay, let's go inside.
        - Also, are you

28:21.734 --> 28:23.233
      fully aware of what
        you're wearing.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.524
           - Shut up.
         - You can wear

28:24.525 --> 28:25.814
     something that I have.
        - Just shut up.

28:25.815 --> 28:27.104
       - Because none of
        that works here.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.440
     Don't listen to Jason.

28:29.442 --> 28:33.711
   He thinks that he's happy
     here, but look at him.

28:33.713 --> 28:35.746
     This moment right now

28:36.782 --> 28:41.185
      is the happiest that
    he's been in five years.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.220
       - [Allie] Are you
      still painting, Jon?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.722
            - I am.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.825
     I might follow you to
      New York, actually.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.226
 - Ooh, we could be roommates.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.428
     - We could, we could!

28:51.430 --> 28:53.497
    Probably not, but maybe.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.999
    - Sumana will come too.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.167
         - Come where?

28:58.738 --> 28:59.837
    - Let's go find a train.

28:59.839 --> 29:00.871
         (Sumana sighs)

29:00.872 --> 29:01.904
        ¶ Train's comin'
        down the track ¶

29:01.907 --> 29:04.074

29:04.076 --> 29:05.843
¶ It's comin' down really fast ¶

29:05.845 --> 29:07.511

     ¶ But not this train,
      it runs on dreams ¶

29:16.822 --> 29:17.821
          ¶ Ooh ooh ¶

29:19.057 --> 29:20.290
      ¶ No, no, not steam,
      it runs on dreams ¶

29:20.292 --> 29:22.192
          ¶ Ooh ooh ¶

29:22.194 --> 29:24.812
       ¶ Ooh, just ooh ¶
   - Chugga, chugga, chugga,

29:24.813 --> 29:27.431
    chugga, chugga, chugga,
chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga,

29:27.433 --> 29:28.432
        chugga, chugga.
     - You missed all this,

29:28.434 --> 29:30.618
           didn't ya?

29:30.619 --> 29:32.803
     - Yeah, I guess I did
     grow up a little bit.

29:32.805 --> 29:37.341
     - Allie, Allie, Allie,
   Allie, you are so amazing!

29:37.343 --> 29:40.110
       You're so amazing
     for going to New York

29:40.112 --> 29:41.812
   and being a Broadway star.

29:41.814 --> 29:44.281
Jaysen, you're even more amazing

29:44.283 --> 29:46.350
for directing community theater

29:46.352 --> 29:48.552
and dressing like an accountant.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.920
      - Okay, thanks, Jon.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.856
        (all chuckling)

29:53.559 --> 29:55.993
        - It's a magical
        world, you guys.

29:56.796 --> 29:57.427
       (Sumana laughing)

29:57.429 --> 29:58.962
       Did you just spit,

29:58.963 --> 30:00.496
   what did you do, ruining?
       (Jaysen laughing)

30:00.499 --> 30:03.834
     (gentle country music)

30:05.237 --> 30:07.838
  - I don't know what I want.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.523
         - [Andrew] You
       want one of these?

30:09.524 --> 30:11.207
  - No, definitely not, gross.

30:22.221 --> 30:26.123
 If we were in Israel, we would
   never be eating this crap.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.826
       - Don't you have a
    McDonald's in Tel Aviv?

30:28.828 --> 30:30.928
    - (chuckles) Yeah, sure.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.897
     It's popular American
         tourist spot.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.268
   You and I should go there.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.837
            - Sure.

30:39.839 --> 30:41.205
       I love McDonald's.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.943
         - No, I mean,

30:48.080 --> 30:49.246
         like, to live.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.616
       For a year, maybe.

30:53.886 --> 30:56.587
    - What would I do there?

30:56.589 --> 31:00.324
   - There's plenty of rehab
   centers you could work at.

31:00.326 --> 31:04.461
   We could rent an apartment
  on the beach near my sister.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.497
      You could just have
        a part-time job

31:07.499 --> 31:10.901
         and enjoy good
      weather for a year.

31:10.903 --> 31:13.203
  - And when the year's over?

31:13.205 --> 31:16.607
    - When the year's over,
       we'll do whatever.

31:16.609 --> 31:19.293
      We'll come back here

31:19.294 --> 31:21.978
   or we'll stay in Tel Aviv
     if you like it there.

31:21.981 --> 31:22.880
           Whatever.

  at her recital this weekend.

32:03.222 --> 32:04.154
  - [Dan] That would be great.

32:04.156 --> 32:04.988
   - All right, there you go.

32:04.990 --> 32:06.023
    - [Dan] Thanks so much.

32:06.025 --> 32:09.226
- [Joni] Have a great day, Dan!

32:09.228 --> 32:10.661
        How's it goin'?

32:10.663 --> 32:11.962
   - Uh, this time next year,

32:11.964 --> 32:14.932
        I'll be serving
     coffee all by myself.

32:14.934 --> 32:17.367
        - [Joni] There's
       a learning curve.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.703
  - Guys, I've been thinkin'.

32:20.639 --> 32:24.508
    I think we need a Saints
    Rest pet, like a mascot.

32:24.510 --> 32:27.311
  - Oh, I thought you already
   filled that role, Michael.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.012
         - I'm serious.

32:29.014 --> 32:30.981
    Joni, what do you think?

32:30.982 --> 32:32.949
     - This all sounds like
 something I don't care about.

32:32.952 --> 32:34.618
       - No, no, no, like
      we should get a dog,

32:34.620 --> 32:35.686
 and then when people come in,

32:35.688 --> 32:37.421
        they'll know the
       dog would be here,

32:37.423 --> 32:39.723
      and they'll pet the
    dog, play with the dog.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.492
  You know, like one of those
 big dogs with the deep voices.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.962
        (Allie laughing)
    (Michael mimics barking)

32:44.964 --> 32:47.631
     Like, bark when people
   come in. (mimics barking)

32:47.633 --> 32:49.433
   Then we'd make tee shirts.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.068
       That's marketing.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.203
     You think on it, boss.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.973
         (Allie laughs)

32:55.975 --> 32:57.975
     - Hey, I was thinking.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.677
    Maybe this weekend, you
    and I could do something

33:00.679 --> 33:03.747
      just the two of us,
        try to catch up.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.150
      - Yeah, yeah, okay.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.588
 - [Allie] Great, it's a date.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.460
         - It's a date.

        (Allie laughing)

33:31.643 --> 33:33.276
        Sorry, I'm late.

33:33.278 --> 33:34.344
          - It's okay.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.349
     - I can't believe this
   is what you wanted to do.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.351
      I haven't been here
    since I was like seven.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.070
           - Really?

33:43.071 --> 33:44.788
       I was here all the
      time in high school.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.056
 Probably shouldn't admit that.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.157
             - No.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.092
             Ready?

33:49.094 --> 33:51.161
       - You set 'em up,
      I'll knock 'em down.

33:51.163 --> 33:51.795
            - Uh oh.
             - Uh,

33:51.797 --> 33:54.731
    bowling for two, please.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.266
     - [Attendant] I'll put
     you guys on lane six.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.401
        What size shoes?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.069
         - I'm a 7 1/2.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.170
           - Me too.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.407
       - You want a beer?

34:03.409 --> 34:04.741
          - You drink?

34:04.743 --> 34:06.410
       - Sure, sometimes.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.277
       - You want me to?

34:07.279 --> 34:08.277
          - I got it.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.449
             Here.

34:15.521 --> 34:19.188
     So, tell me about this
      guy Danny's seeing.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.558
   - (chuckles) Andrew, yes.

34:21.560 --> 34:25.395
He romances her with his guitar.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.463
         (Allie laughs)

34:26.465 --> 34:27.531
     - Well, is it working?

34:27.533 --> 34:29.833
 - Oh, hell yeah, it's working.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.235
     Can't sleep at night,
     it's working so well.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.538
        (Allie laughing)

34:34.540 --> 34:36.540
    - Are you seeing anyone?

34:36.542 --> 34:37.541
          - Yeah, no.

34:39.545 --> 34:43.080
    Do you have any leftover
   boyfriends from Stanford?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.414
             - No.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.484
      I got kind of tired
        of college boys.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.420
     I think I'm just ready
   for something more mature.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.723
    - You mean, like a man?

34:53.725 --> 34:54.591
           - Exactly.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.727
        - Good luck with
        that. (chuckles)

34:57.729 --> 35:01.631
  They're all just little boys
   pretending to be Han Solo.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.200
        - [Allie] Right.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.335
     - How 'bout that guy?

35:05.337 --> 35:07.838
    - Oh, he's just my type.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.207
  - You want a man, don't you?

35:10.209 --> 35:11.808
  That's what they look like.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.293
        I mean, he's one
       of the good ones.

35:13.294 --> 35:14.777
      He's probably out of
      your league, Allie.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.346
       - Okay, just bowl.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.891
         Off to a great
       start. (chuckling)

35:27.893 --> 35:29.693
     - [Joni] Yeah, watch.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.163
   - Well, you should try the
   special flavor sometimes.

35:33.165 --> 35:34.464
       - I'll try yours.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.168
              Mm.

35:39.204 --> 35:40.437
         Mine's better.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.806

35:42.808 --> 35:43.874
         (Danny groans)

35:43.876 --> 35:46.176
     God, I need to shower.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.924
- So, I was thinking about this,

36:01.693 --> 36:06.196
  and I couldn't come up with
    a better way to say it,

        - [Andrew] Okay.

36:58.850 --> 37:02.886
     - [Danny] How much did
  that thing cost you anyway?

37:02.888 --> 37:03.987
       - [Andrew] It was
        like five bucks.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.622
         - [Danny] Oh.

37:05.623 --> 37:07.256

38:56.412 --> 38:57.389
       and she got tall.
    - When I was like three.

38:57.390 --> 38:58.367

46:46.938 --> 46:48.070
         - Wait, Allie.

46:48.072 --> 46:49.138
        - [Allie] Yeah?

46:49.139 --> 46:50.205
 - You're not leavin', are you?

46:50.206 --> 46:51.272
        - [Allie] Yeah,
       I just said that.

46:51.276 --> 46:54.443
        - But you're not
     headin' out, are you?

46:54.445 --> 46:55.945
            - Yeah.

46:55.947 --> 46:58.414
      - Whoa, whoa, whoa,
       whoa! Whoa, Allie!

46:58.416 --> 46:59.582
            - What?

46:59.584 --> 47:02.151
 - You're not leavin', are you?

47:02.153 --> 47:03.286
        (Allie laughing)

47:03.288 --> 47:05.071
     Wait, where you goin'?

47:05.072 --> 47:06.855
  - [Allie] Goodbye, Michael.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.157
       - Psh, all right.

47:14.098 --> 47:16.499
      - [Allie] This place
   reminds me of being a kid.

47:16.501 --> 47:18.467
    - [Joni] You are a kid.

47:19.504 --> 47:22.238
    - [Allie] Mom never let
   me hang out here with you.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.006
     - You were, like, ten.

47:24.008 --> 47:25.308
       I didn't want you
      hangin' around here.

47:25.310 --> 47:27.977
       I was tryin' to be
      a cool college kid.

47:27.979 --> 47:30.112
    - Hey, I was crazy cool
      for a ten year-old.

47:30.114 --> 47:32.915
        (Joni laughing)

47:32.917 --> 47:34.667
- Of course, it didn't stop her

47:34.668 --> 47:36.418
  from coming to every single
    one of my performances.

47:36.421 --> 47:38.988
 - God, that's so embarrassing.

47:40.592 --> 47:42.425
     She loved your music.

47:45.163 --> 47:49.365
   I forget how quiet it gets
 here, even on Saturday night.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.467
 Sometimes you forget to think.

47:51.469 --> 47:53.970
    - I can't stop thinking.

47:53.972 --> 47:55.204
             - Hey!

47:55.206 --> 47:57.106
       You guys goin' to
       the Loggia party?

47:57.108 --> 47:58.007
     - [Allie] You know it!

47:58.009 --> 47:59.609
     - Well get goin', son!

47:59.611 --> 48:01.077
         (men yelling)

48:01.079 --> 48:02.612
          - Oh my god.

48:02.614 --> 48:05.348
   - You gonna miss college?

48:05.350 --> 48:06.616
        - That depends.

48:06.618 --> 48:07.917
           - On what?

48:08.553 --> 48:10.386
        - If I like the
      next part. (laughs)

48:10.388 --> 48:12.154
         (Joni laughs)

48:12.156 --> 48:14.590
    - Ask your pal, Jaysen.

48:14.592 --> 48:16.926
  - I know, he's mastered it.

48:17.662 --> 48:20.263
        (Joni chuckles)

48:24.402 --> 48:27.203
        (Allie laughing)

48:32.110 --> 48:36.012
   - What I noticed most was
    that at a certain point,

48:36.014 --> 48:39.148
         you just stop
      meeting new people,

48:39.150 --> 48:40.650
        and I don't know
    exactly when it happens,

48:40.652 --> 48:43.519
       but you'll see, at
        a certain point,

48:43.521 --> 48:46.923
     you just, you just see
   the same people every day

48:46.925 --> 48:50.927
       and have the same
 interactions again and again.

48:52.263 --> 48:54.030
       - That sounds bad.

48:54.966 --> 48:56.666
     - No, not necessarily.

48:59.437 --> 49:01.704
    - Well, I'm sure I'll be
  meeting a ton of new people

49:01.706 --> 49:03.306
    when I move to the city.

49:03.308 --> 49:05.041
            - Yeah.

49:05.043 --> 49:09.512
  Yeah, then they'll move away
  or get married or have kids

49:09.514 --> 49:10.546
 and then they won't have time,

49:10.548 --> 49:13.282
and that's just, you know, life.

49:17.689 --> 49:20.623
You love something, you lose it.

49:25.496 --> 49:27.997
      You remember it, you
    smile thinking about it,

49:27.999 --> 49:31.133
      and then slowly, it
      starts fading away.

49:38.009 --> 49:41.177
      (train horn blowing)

50:00.164 --> 50:02.198
       I went all night.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.366
      I don't know, Allie.

50:03.368 --> 50:04.200
       - Morning, Crosby.

50:04.202 --> 50:05.401
            - Don't.
           - Morning.

50:05.403 --> 50:07.370
    - What are you reading?

50:09.073 --> 50:10.573
             - Al--
          - Oh, nice.

50:12.010 --> 50:15.711
   - Your mom used to tell me
 this joke, you wanna hear it?

50:15.713 --> 50:16.746
            - Yeah.

50:16.748 --> 50:19.115
       - How do you catch
        a unique rabbit?

50:19.117 --> 50:20.082
             - How?

50:20.084 --> 50:21.550
       - Unique up on it.

50:21.552 --> 50:22.918
         (Allie laughs)

50:22.919 --> 50:24.285
     - Yeah, but how do you
      catch a tame rabbit?

50:24.288 --> 50:25.454
             - How?

50:25.456 --> 50:27.089
          - Tame way.

50:27.091 --> 50:29.492
        Come on, let's.
         (Allie laughs)

50:29.494 --> 50:32.661
      (patrons chattering)

50:59.157 --> 51:01.290
    - One, two, three, look.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.092
     One, two, three, look.

51:03.094 --> 51:03.926
          Oh, come on.

51:03.927 --> 51:04.759
           - Come on.
      - Okay, okay, okay.

51:04.762 --> 51:05.672
             Okay.
            - Hurry.

51:05.673 --> 51:06.583
        - I'm in there.
           - Michael.

51:06.584 --> 51:07.494
      - We have to give--
           - Michael,

51:07.495 --> 51:08.405
      you want to help me?
      - One, two, three--

51:08.406 --> 51:09.316
         - Wa, wa, wa--
             - Oh!

51:09.317 --> 51:10.227
       - One, two, three.
         - Wait, wait!

51:10.234 --> 51:11.350
           We can't--
        - Thanks, Joni.

51:11.351 --> 51:12.467
        - Guys, come on.
         - Okay, okay.

51:12.470 --> 51:13.369
             - One.
             - Two.

51:13.371 --> 51:14.637
            - Three.
            - Look!

51:14.639 --> 51:16.439
            - Yeah!
        (Sumana cheers)

51:16.441 --> 51:17.339
           Yes, yes!

51:19.143 --> 51:20.810
       - Andrew proposed.

51:20.812 --> 51:21.777
       - [Michael] Okay,
       okay, okay, okay!

51:21.779 --> 51:23.145
           - Really?

51:23.147 --> 51:24.380
            - Yeah.

51:24.382 --> 51:26.549
         (Allie laughs)
    - I wasn't expecting it.

51:26.551 --> 51:28.184
      - What did you say?

51:29.087 --> 51:32.154
     - I think I just said
     yes to talking about.

51:32.156 --> 51:34.156
      - [Michael] Come on!

51:34.158 --> 51:36.292
  - Did you tell your family?

51:36.294 --> 51:38.360
        - Of course not.

51:38.362 --> 51:40.196
      - Did you tell Joni?

51:40.198 --> 51:41.697
        - Are you crazy?

51:41.699 --> 51:43.732
         - Later, guys.

51:43.734 --> 51:45.167
         - [Danny] Bye!

51:46.704 --> 51:47.603
            Finally.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.842
        - You wanna try
       this one together?

51:52.844 --> 51:54.510
      - You remember that?

51:54.512 --> 51:55.678
         - I think so.

51:57.215 --> 51:58.380
         Andrew, here.

51:59.150 --> 52:00.716
       - Let me see that.

52:02.887 --> 52:05.488
          (Joni sighs)

52:05.490 --> 52:06.388

      don't listen to him.

     - Uh, close your eyes.

56:54.678 --> 56:55.511
        - Close my eyes?

56:55.513 --> 56:56.779
       - Close your ears.

56:56.781 --> 56:58.414
          Get out now!

       it's not that bad.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.483
    - Listen, Grinnell, Iowa

57:01.485 --> 57:04.586
      is about as specific
        as this ketchup,

57:04.588 --> 57:06.054
  and if you don't leave now,

57:06.056 --> 57:08.457
      you're gonna end up
     just like this bottle,

57:08.459 --> 57:13.529
     uninteresting, alone,
     and always half empty.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.831
    - Well, then why are you
 still here annoying everyone?

57:15.833 --> 57:17.733
 - I don't know, your boyfriend
   was busy, so I wasn't able

57:17.735 --> 57:18.593
      to go out with him.
        - Busy with me.

57:18.594 --> 57:19.452
     - Oh, well, that was--
       - We were Skyping.

57:19.453 --> 57:20.311
      We had a Skype date.
         - None of you

57:20.312 --> 57:21.170
       are dating anyone.

             - Hey.

57:47.097 --> 57:48.197
             - Hey.
       - Where'd you go?

57:48.199 --> 57:49.598
          - No where.

57:51.535 --> 57:53.168
    - Jon is so ridiculous.

57:53.170 --> 57:55.804
  Tonight was too big a dose.

57:55.806 --> 57:57.206
- [Joni] How much is your rent?

57:57.208 --> 57:59.108
         - [Allie] Hmm?

57:59.109 --> 58:01.009
       - In New York, how
    much will your rent be?

58:01.011 --> 58:03.078
 - [Allie] I don't know, a lot.

58:03.080 --> 58:05.164
   - Bet it's like five times

58:05.165 --> 58:07.249
    what you'd pay here for
      a quarter the space.

58:07.251 --> 58:08.734
   - [Allie] Yeah, probably.

58:08.735 --> 58:10.218
    - Of course, you're not
  paying for the space, right?

58:10.221 --> 58:13.239
You're paying for the location,

58:13.240 --> 58:16.258
       all the shops and
      the restaurants and

58:16.694 --> 58:18.461
        - What's wrong?

58:18.462 --> 58:20.229
    - (sighs) Just probably
 won't have time to come home.

58:20.231 --> 58:22.264
       Wheres the remote?

58:22.266 --> 58:24.533
    - Joni, I'll come visit.

58:25.603 --> 58:28.003
   - Like you did in college.

58:28.005 --> 58:31.773
        - I was working,
       I was in shows, I,

58:31.775 --> 58:33.775
   I was building my career.

58:33.777 --> 58:36.512
     - What career exactly
     are you talking about?

58:36.514 --> 58:39.815
  You got one tiny supporting
role like a thousand other girls

58:39.817 --> 58:43.252
      that are now waiting
      tables in Manhattan.

58:43.254 --> 58:47.122
    - As opposed to waiting
   tables in Grinnell, Iowa?

58:47.124 --> 58:49.892
      At least I'm trying
      to do something and

58:53.564 --> 58:56.064
   - Hey, I don't blame you.

58:56.066 --> 58:58.000
        Mom's dead, your
     friends are assholes,

58:58.002 --> 59:01.637
    and God-forbid, you end
   up like Jaysen or like me,

59:01.639 --> 59:04.873
 stuck in a dead place without
  a trace of fucking culture.

59:04.875 --> 59:06.241
      - [Allie] This isn't
      about Jaysen, okay?

59:06.243 --> 59:07.676
        Nobody's forcing
       you to stay here.

59:07.678 --> 59:10.078
     If you don't wanna be
      here, you can leave.

59:10.080 --> 59:13.649
  - It never occurs to anyone
   that maybe I like it here?

59:13.651 --> 59:15.183
  Maybe I consider this home?

59:15.185 --> 59:17.553
       - [Allie] Do you?

59:17.555 --> 59:19.255
            - Maybe.

59:19.256 --> 59:20.956
   - Okay, then that's great.

59:20.957 --> 59:22.657
 That's just fucking fantastic,
  but I'm not like you, okay?

59:22.660 --> 59:24.343
 I can't have a singing career

59:24.344 --> 59:26.027
       in the middle of a
       fucking cornfield.

59:26.030 --> 59:28.964
 I'm not okay with just waking
  up and going to Saints Rest

59:28.966 --> 59:30.666
  and then going to Lonnski's
      and then going home,

59:30.668 --> 59:32.301
     and then that's it for
      the rest of my life.

59:32.303 --> 59:33.869
       I don't want that.

59:33.871 --> 59:35.571
 - [Joni] Do you hear yourself?

59:35.573 --> 59:38.740
  - [Allie] I wish you'd just
say what your fucking issue is.

59:38.742 --> 59:40.876
     - My fucking issue is
    that you don't even care

59:40.878 --> 59:42.177
        that we're only
      gonna see each other

59:42.179 --> 59:44.179
    maybe 20 more times for
     the rest of our lives.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.314
      - That's ridiculous.

59:45.316 --> 59:46.615
 I'm a three-hour flight away.

59:46.617 --> 59:48.584
        I can come home
     multiple times a year.

59:48.586 --> 59:49.685
      - [Joni] Fantastic!

59:49.687 --> 59:51.453
        I used to have a
       sister every day.

59:51.454 --> 59:53.220
      I didn't realize it
      was a childhood fad.

59:53.223 --> 59:55.257
   - [Allie] It's not a fad,

59:55.258 --> 59:57.292
  but you can't keep everybody
    static around you, okay?

59:57.294 --> 59:58.660
    Even Danny's gonna leave

59:58.662 --> 59:59.695
          eventually.
      - Oh okay, whatever.

59:59.697 --> 01:00:01.230
   - [Allie] No, she told me.

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:02.764
   Andrew proposed, but she's
     too afraid to tell you

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:07.669
 because you're such a fucking
  psycho about people leaving.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:12.674
      Where are you going?

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:14.343
     - Apparently, nowhere.

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:17.146
  Have fun singing Moon River

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:19.948
    to a bunch of rich white
   people nine times a week.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.651
          (door slams)

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:27.356
         ("My Friend")

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:38.767
         ¶ My friend ¶

01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:42.170
           ¶ Mm mm ¶

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:47.242
           ¶ Mm mm ¶

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:52.681
            ¶ Why ¶

01:00:52.683 --> 01:00:57.753
            ¶ Why ¶

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:02.224
          ¶ Mm mm mm ¶

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:07.295
          ¶ Mm mm mm ¶

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:14.369
       ¶ Mm mm mm mm mm ¶

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:19.708
          ¶ Ooh ooh ¶

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:23.311
      ¶ And I asked why ¶

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:28.083
            ¶ Why ¶

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:31.720
     ¶ And then she said ¶

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:36.792
     ¶ Da da da da da da ¶

01:01:40.898 --> 01:01:45.967
     ¶ Mm mm mm mm mm mm ¶

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.337
        ¶ Ooh ooh ooh ¶

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:15.430
        - Think I should
    repaint the coffee shop?

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:16.331
            - Sure.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.735
      Could use an update.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:22.170
  - Michael keeps egging me to
   take down the sea turtles,

01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:24.840
       says he feels like
      they're judging him.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.475
      - They probably are.

01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:28.043
       They're very wise.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:35.984
   You won't be able to stay
     mad at her, will you?

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:38.320
      - You know I keep a
     death grip on grudges.

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:41.056
      - She's just a short
        plane ride away.

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:45.761
   It's not like you need to
  fly 15 hours to go see her.

01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:49.831
   - Anyway, it'll all pass.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:50.932
            - What?

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:55.537
     - This whole Broadway
  thing, it's not gonna last.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:56.905
          - It's not?

01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.975
  - Not like me, not forever.

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:04.212
 I'm the motherfucking diamond.

01:03:05.983 --> 01:03:07.015
 - Come on, it's not Broadway.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:09.518
       It's only open mic
        night, let's go.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.386
      - Okay, one minute.

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:16.958
        - Go ask Joni if
       she wants to come.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:26.334
             - Hey.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:32.207
Uh, Danny's taking me out since
  it's my last night and all.

01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:36.111
It'd be great if you could join
  us, if you're not too tired.

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:37.579
         - Yeah, fine.

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:40.081
 - And just so I don't forget.

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:45.120
   Finally get your car back.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.193
 - [Danny] We went to the mall.

01:03:51.195 --> 01:03:55.230
        (Allie and Danny
       speaking faintly)

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:58.567
      - That's impressive,
       that's like a lot.

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:01.536
            - Cool.

01:04:01.538 --> 01:04:02.871
        (Joni laughing)

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:03.505
           Hey, Joni.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:04.906
            - Scott.

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:06.474
  - It's been a while, right?

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:09.544
        - I thought you
       were in the city.

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:12.613
 - I was, I moved back a couple
  weeks ago, been layin' low.

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:14.316
   - You didn't like Chicago?

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:17.152
- Nah, it's not really my speed.

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:21.607
            - Yeah.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.058
Well, sorry it didn't work out.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.611
       - Nah, it's cool.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:28.163
   It's been good to see some
familiar faces around, ya know?

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:29.064
            - Yeah.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.933
            - Joni!

01:04:31.935 --> 01:04:32.934
    Hold on, I got you guys.

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:34.302
        Here, take one.

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:35.904
All right, all right, all right.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:37.572
   To my favorite threesome.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:39.374
           - Cheers.
         (Allie laughs)

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.610
      (patrons chattering)

01:04:41.612 --> 01:04:43.078
        - [Michael] Mm!

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.246
        (Michael groans)

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:45.413
 - I'm gonna miss you, Michael.

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:46.581
      - What do you mean?

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.950
       - I mean I'm gonna
     miss you when I leave.

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:50.552
       - You're leaving?

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.487
     - Yeah, like tomorrow.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:53.689
            - What?

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:54.890
         (Danny laughs)
     When did this happen?

01:04:54.892 --> 01:04:56.224
   Are you kidding me, Joni?

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.626
    - You didn't know that?

01:04:57.628 --> 01:05:01.029
        She got a gig on
       Broadway, stupid.

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.098
     - So, you're leavin'?

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.966
 Whoa, that changes everything.

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:06.635
  Kevin, can I get four more.

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:08.203
         (Danny laughs)
          - Hey, guys.

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:09.571
          - Yo, baby.
             - Hey.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:12.073
 - [Danny] Let's grab a table.

01:05:14.544 --> 01:05:17.913
  - I'm so jealous you get to
  work with Michael every day.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.419
 I'm really gonna miss it here.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.922
 - I get it, Allie, it's fine.

01:05:32.663 --> 01:05:35.297
   - So, this is only to keep
   me from leaving next year.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:40.719
             - No.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.936
 - [Danny] But only if I stay.

01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:47.008
 - Well, you came to the States
 because you wanted to, right?

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:51.212
      - Sure, I mean, for
    college, for med school,

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:56.318
     but I was always gonna
    go back home eventually.

01:05:57.387 --> 01:05:59.354
    - Can't I be your home?

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:07.062
      (speaking in Hebrew)

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:08.730
             What?

01:06:14.338 --> 01:06:16.104
       - That's my point.

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:19.574
        (crowd cheering)

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:24.112
 - All right, thank you, Raven,
  for that lovely performance.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:25.680
       Up next, we have?

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:26.514
            - Allie.

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:27.382
            - Allie.

01:06:27.384 --> 01:06:28.984
        (crowd cheering)

01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:30.051
          - Thank you.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:36.558
  Uh, this is a song I wrote.

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:39.494
      I hope you like it.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.198
         ("My Friend")

01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:54.776
      ¶ My friend told me
     life was in the city ¶

01:06:54.778 --> 01:07:00.048
      ¶ The lights burned
        brighter there ¶

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:05.186
      ¶ My friend told me
     life would be a pity ¶

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:10.158
 ¶ Without settling out there ¶

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.528
      ¶ And I asked why ¶

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:18.400
            ¶ Why ¶

01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:22.771
    ¶ My friend told me that
   the darkness ruled here ¶

01:07:22.773 --> 01:07:27.575
     ¶ There is no point to
      raising our voices ¶

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:32.647
  ¶ She said we're wasting all
   our summers in this town ¶

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:38.053
        ¶ We shout, hey,
       but no one cares ¶

01:07:38.055 --> 01:07:41.389
      ¶ And I asked why ¶

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:45.593
            ¶ Why ¶

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:50.665
      ¶ And then she said,
   there's no freedom here ¶

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:55.537
¶ To live the life she dreamed ¶

01:07:55.539 --> 01:08:00.608
     ¶ And when she's here,
     the music disappears ¶

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:07.449
       ¶ So she's flying
       to free her mind ¶

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:29.470
      ¶ My friend tells me
     life is not the city ¶

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:34.408
      ¶ That bright lights
    lead us the wrong way ¶

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:39.279
      ¶ My friend tells me
    life here isn't pretty ¶

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:44.219
¶ And yet she chooses to stay ¶

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:48.890
      ¶ And I asked why ¶

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:53.228
            ¶ Why ¶

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:58.299
            ¶ Why ¶

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:06.640
         ¶ I wish she'd
       find the freedom ¶

01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:13.214
¶ To live the life she dreamed ¶

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:18.286

         There you are.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.952
             - Hey.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:51.853
             - Hey.

01:09:54.758 --> 01:09:57.659
        - That was, that
       was great, Allie.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:00.528
           - Thanks.

01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:06.634
      - Okay, you can go.

        that's awesome.

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:41.603
           - Thanks.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.870
       Probably very dark
     and a little strange.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:44.872
      - A little bit, but
    it's still a great city.

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:48.243
      (patrons chattering)

01:10:49.346 --> 01:10:52.714
   (upbeat electronic music)

01:10:58.822 --> 01:11:01.289
       - All right, Joni.

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:02.357
          - [Joni] Mm.

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:03.524
     - We'll take 'em all.

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:04.359
            Come on.

     Michael, put me down.

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:08.263
     Put me down, Michael!

        (crowd cheering)

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:07.088
   Do you have orange balls?

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:08.323
      - [Michael] Uh huh.

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:09.324
       - (laughs) Do you?

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.324
        - [Michael] No,
     they're usually blue.

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:11.693
         (Joni laughs)

01:12:11.695 --> 01:12:13.561
     - That's good, that's
      the way I like you.

        (Michael laughs)

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:17.515
         Okay, shut up.

01:12:17.516 --> 01:12:19.966
 If I make this shot, no one's
 allowed to move anywhere ever.

01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:20.835
             Deal?

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:21.736
            - Deal.

01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:24.038
    Don't worry, she sucks.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:24.972

          - Whoospies.

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:27.675
            Whoopsy!
      - Watch it, Michael!

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.949
   - Hey, hey, hey, you guys
    aren't leavin', are you?

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:36.351
             - No!
     - What's it look like?

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:37.752
     - But you guys aren't
     headin' out, are you?

01:12:37.754 --> 01:12:39.053
       - Just ignore him.

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:41.356
       - Hey, you're not
       takin' off, right?

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.458
    But seriously, you guys
 aren't leavin' though, right?

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.727
     - [Danny] No, Michael,
       we're not leaving.

01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:47.362
      - [Joni] Oh my god.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:49.931
          - All right.

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.868
         - [Joni] Oh my
       god, what a night.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:57.405
        I haven't danced
     like that since 1979.

01:12:57.407 --> 01:13:00.375
         (all laughing)

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:02.410
 - [Allie] Danny, make me food.

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:04.145
     - [Danny] Why doesn't
   anybody ever make me food.

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:05.613
       - [Allie] Because
      you're the grownup.

01:13:05.615 --> 01:13:06.881
       - [Joni] What does
       that make me then?

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:10.785
       - [Allie] (laughs)
       The other grownup.

01:13:10.787 --> 01:13:13.121
     - [Joni] You're lucky
      you're a cute drunk.

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:17.492
       - [Allie] Will you
      carry me? (laughing)

01:13:17.494 --> 01:13:18.126
             - Ow.
          - Good god,

01:13:18.128 --> 01:13:19.761
         I have to pee.

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:22.997
      - I'm seriously too
       old for this shit.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:26.467
    (Joni and Danny sighing)

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:28.603
       Oh, this is nice.

01:13:28.605 --> 01:13:29.670
          - Oh my god.

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:38.946
       - You know you can
       talk to me, right?

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:42.450
      I don't have to hear
       things from Allie.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:47.655
   - It just didn't feel like
  something you'd wanna hear.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:50.158
 - [Joni] I don't, but I will.

01:13:52.495 --> 01:13:54.595
     What are you gonna do?

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:00.501
- I feel like I need to go home.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:07.542
            - Okay.

01:14:10.647 --> 01:14:12.980
  - [Danny] What will you do?

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.451
   - I'm gonna die of hunger
   in that corner over there.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:17.785
        (Danny laughing)

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.804
       - [Danny] Shut up.

01:14:19.805 --> 01:14:21.822
    - What are you laughing
        about? (laughs)

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:22.957
         I'll be fine.

01:14:23.726 --> 01:14:25.159
       I've got Michael.

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:26.961
     - [Allie] I'm hungry.

01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:32.934
        - That's all we
      have, eat it slowly.

01:14:35.205 --> 01:14:36.037
         - Oh, heaven.

01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:37.538

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:52.854
   - You don't remember this?

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:56.991
