00:04.091 --> 00:06.006
- Previously,
on "Good Girls"...

00:06.049 --> 00:07.268
- It's a serial number.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.312
- She keeps records
of her cash?

00:08.356 --> 00:09.618
- They're counterfeiters.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.315
- You said you needed
a retainer,

00:11.359 --> 00:13.230
so this should cover it.

00:13.274 --> 00:15.754
- I'm a D-bag,
so I know when I see one.

00:17.191 --> 00:20.803
- Noah is FBI.
I told him stuff.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.675
He's not my boyfriend anymore.
- Maybe he should be.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.548
It would get him off our trail.
- With my vagina?

00:26.591 --> 00:29.029
- I want to make it as easy
as possible for the kids.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.900
I need to protect my family.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.771
- I would have made you
so happy.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.517
What are you doing?
- It was an accident.

00:39.561 --> 00:42.042
- Yeah, I mean, he--
he ran behind the car.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.347
- Yeah.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.349
- She murdered him, Beth.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.830
- We were about to do
the same thing.

00:47.873 --> 00:50.572
- Yeah, but we didn't.
- We made her call him.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.356
- What are we supposed
to do with this?

00:52.400 --> 00:55.490
all: One--
- Oh, God, whoa!

00:55.533 --> 00:58.580
all: Two, three!

01:02.714 --> 01:06.370
- It's Boomer.
I mean, it has to be, right?

01:06.414 --> 01:08.546
- Yeah, I figured
I'd hold onto it for a bit.

01:08.590 --> 01:13.073
You know, just to be safe.
One man's trash...

01:13.116 --> 01:16.554
- If he didn't have that body,
he couldn't hold it over us.

01:18.513 --> 01:21.124
- Cooper's dog is eating
your new flowers.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.087
- What color was Boomer's hair?

01:28.262 --> 01:30.220
- You'll never get me!

01:46.323 --> 01:48.151
You'll never take me alive!

01:51.198 --> 01:52.329
You want some?
You want some?

01:52.373 --> 01:55.593
How about you?
You want some?

01:55.637 --> 01:57.073
You can't get me!

03:19.590 --> 03:22.202
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, wash up, boys.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.682
- What's for dinner?
- Macaroni.

03:24.726 --> 03:27.119
Where's Daddy?
- Sleeping.

03:27.163 --> 03:30.688
- Where?
- On the grass.

03:42.352 --> 03:45.137
- Oh, my God!

03:45.181 --> 03:47.009
Oh, my God, Jeff!

03:51.361 --> 03:54.973
Okay, okay.

03:55.017 --> 03:58.281
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Um, it's my husband.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.371
He--
- Yes, ma'am?

04:04.156 --> 04:06.463
Ma'am, are you there?

04:06.507 --> 04:09.423
Ma'am, are you okay?
What happened?

04:09.466 --> 04:11.468
- Nothing, sorry.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.845
- Huh.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.552
- Hi, it's me again.

04:51.595 --> 04:54.337
So I'm just going to say this
because I don't know

04:54.381 --> 04:56.992
if you're, like,
in a meeting or something,

04:57.035 --> 05:00.169
but, um--we have
a little bit of a problem.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.649
I mean, it's not a problem yet,

05:01.692 --> 05:04.086
but it is definitely
a situation.

05:04.129 --> 05:07.437
Um, so...

05:07.481 --> 05:12.747
you know that jacket you wanted
us to get rid of a while back?

05:12.790 --> 05:16.881
We may have thrown away
the wrong jacket,

05:16.925 --> 05:19.623
and we obviously
need to find the right one

05:19.667 --> 05:23.453
before someone else does,
so if you could call me back

05:23.497 --> 05:27.501
so we could discuss this matter
in more detail, that would--

05:27.544 --> 05:29.111
- Hey, sorry.
- Hi.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.026
- Uh, they're all ready
when you are.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.767
- Okay, one second.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.775
Okay, thank you.

05:45.693 --> 05:50.611
The most important thing
is it is not your fault.

05:50.654 --> 05:54.876
- You are allowed
to feel sad, okay?

05:54.919 --> 05:56.312
Or angry.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.924
- We love you
more than anything.

05:59.968 --> 06:03.363
- And we are going to
get through this as a family.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.890
- Does anyone
have any questions?

06:12.894 --> 06:16.593
- Do we get two Christmases?

06:16.637 --> 06:18.943
- Uh--
- Um--

06:18.987 --> 06:22.469
- It's--
- What about birthdays?

06:24.645 --> 06:26.211
- Presents come from
both of you, right?

06:26.255 --> 06:29.432
So if you're not married,
then we should get double.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.086
- And two parties!
- Yeah!

06:31.129 --> 06:32.566
- Yay!

06:32.609 --> 06:37.222
- These-these are all
smart questions.

06:37.266 --> 06:42.402
- Does anyone have a question
that doesn't involve presents?

06:50.105 --> 06:52.150
Okay.

06:52.194 --> 06:55.153
- If anything comes to mind--
- Who's moving out?

07:03.466 --> 07:05.076
- No one yet.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.557
- Are you mad at Daddy
because he got a new job?

07:07.601 --> 07:10.691
- No!
Don't be silly.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.476
- Do you still love each other?
- Oh, buddy, yes.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.782
Of course we do.

07:14.825 --> 07:17.088
- Then why can't you just
say you're sorry?

07:17.132 --> 07:19.177
- That's what you
tell us to do.

07:19.221 --> 07:23.268
- It's...

07:23.312 --> 07:25.096
complicated.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.750
- No, it's not.

07:28.926 --> 07:33.888
- Sometimes, grown-ups...

07:33.931 --> 07:37.108
realize they want
different things.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.110
- So what do you want?

08:06.790 --> 08:10.838
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.713
- So we meet.

08:16.757 --> 08:21.283
You seduce me
on top of some produce.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.850
You break up with me.

08:22.893 --> 08:27.811
Then you get me drunk,
have your way with me.

08:27.855 --> 08:33.774
- And you're complaining?
- I'm just confused.

08:39.388 --> 08:42.347
- I date a lot of guys

08:42.391 --> 08:46.308
who pretend to be something
that they're not.

08:48.876 --> 08:52.836
- Here's the thing with me.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.970
What you see is what you get.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.845
- Romans, 7:15.

09:01.889 --> 09:05.370
"I do not understand
my own actions,

09:05.414 --> 09:11.202
"for I do not do what I want,
but I do the very thing I hate.

09:11.246 --> 09:15.555
"So now, it is no longer
I who do it,

09:15.598 --> 09:19.776
but the sin
that dwells within me."

09:19.820 --> 09:24.128
We are all sinners.
all: Amen.

09:24.172 --> 09:27.218
- But continuing to do it,
whatever it is we're doing,

09:27.262 --> 09:32.180
day after day, week after week,
when we know better.

09:32.223 --> 09:35.183
Come on now, hm?

09:35.226 --> 09:41.102
That, my brothers and sisters,
may be the biggest sin of all.

09:41.145 --> 09:44.540
Who's with me?
all: Amen.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.021
- Let us pray.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.545
- But I want juice and cookies!
- We'll have some at home.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.720
- All right,
let's hustle up, team.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.113
- We don't have cookies
at home.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.723
- We'll make some.
- We're out of flour.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.333
- We'll get some.
- We're out of butter too.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.466
- Hey, would you please go get
your damn coats, please?

09:57.509 --> 10:01.165
- I'll buy you a cookie, okay?
- It's a great sermon, huh?

10:01.209 --> 10:04.429
Oh, I love it when a reverend
tells it like it is.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.129
Is it usually that raunchy?
- Yes.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.826
- Is he going to take
Daddy again?

10:09.870 --> 10:11.262
- No, everything's fine.

10:11.306 --> 10:13.134
- I'm still hoping
we can work it out.

10:13.177 --> 10:16.006
You know what?
These cookies, they're on me.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.747
- Hey, man, we don't
want your money.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.836
- Good, because this ain't
real money.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.623
You know what this is?
- Stan.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.930
- Uh-oh, she knows.
- Let's go.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.977
Let's just go, baby.
- This here is motive.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.674
The grocery store manager
figured out your hustle,

10:31.718 --> 10:34.808
so he had to go, right?
- What are you talking about?

10:34.851 --> 10:36.897
- I'm saying
when there's motive,

10:36.940 --> 10:38.855
you don't really
need a body anymore.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.291
- What do you want from us?

10:40.335 --> 10:41.771
- I want you home
making cookies with your kids,

10:41.815 --> 10:44.905
but you only get that
if you take my deal.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.647
- It's Sunday, man.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.126
- The train is leaving
the station.

10:49.170 --> 10:52.260
I'm trying to save you guys
a couple of seats.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.479
- Talk to our lawyer.

11:04.272 --> 11:06.056
- You play Monopoly?

11:06.100 --> 11:08.755
Because this here
is Monopoly money.

11:12.454 --> 11:15.805
- American...
all: Wheel Deal!

11:15.849 --> 11:17.851
- Hey, you got that guarantee?

11:17.894 --> 11:19.940
all: Upfront pricing
can't be beat!

11:19.983 --> 11:22.203
- Do you have a car for me?

11:22.246 --> 11:25.554
all: Yes, we do.
We guarantee!

11:27.904 --> 11:29.732
- I'm ready to go.
Are you guys ready to go?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.038
- Yes!
- Get out there!

11:31.081 --> 11:35.042
- Hey, yeah, all right.
- All right.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.739
Hey, don't worry.
You'll--you'll get it.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.219
- It's so clever.
- Hm.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.090
Hey, what gets you
out of bed, man?

11:40.134 --> 11:42.484
- Usually my kids.
- Walk with me.

11:42.527 --> 11:43.877
- Or I've got this app
on my phone that plays,

11:43.920 --> 11:45.748
like, sounds of,
like, the forest.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.228
- No, no, I'm saying, what--

11:47.271 --> 11:48.751
what puts your feet
on the ground

11:48.795 --> 11:50.579
and gets that heart pumping?

11:50.622 --> 11:51.928
- Making deals?

11:51.972 --> 11:53.321
- That's what
I'm talking about.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.193
- Yeah, I'm a closer, dog.
- Ooh, yeah!

11:56.237 --> 11:57.760
- I've been moving cars longer

11:57.804 --> 11:59.283
than some of these kids
have been alive.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.591
- Sing it, sister.
- I can sell snow to an Eskimo!

12:02.634 --> 12:04.636
- Now, we don't do that here.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.161
- What do you mean?

12:08.640 --> 12:14.081
I know it says that, but--
- It's--it's our promise.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.647
- Oh.

12:17.040 --> 12:21.001
Well, where's the fun in that?

12:21.044 --> 12:23.264
- Hey, you got that guarantee?

12:23.307 --> 12:25.788
all: Upfront pricing
can't be beat!

12:25.832 --> 12:27.790
- Do you have a car for me?

12:27.834 --> 12:30.401
all: Yes, we do.
We guarantee!

12:33.753 --> 12:36.103
- Welcome aboard.

12:42.022 --> 12:45.373
- Mary Pat!
Open up!

12:45.416 --> 12:47.201
- It's real dark
in this hellhole.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.942
- There are no diapers
in her trash.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.945
Just a bunch of coupons.
- When did they expire?

12:51.988 --> 12:55.426
- Like, two months ago.
- No!

12:55.470 --> 12:58.125
- Where is this bitch?
- I don't know.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.909
But she is going
to go down for this,

12:59.953 --> 13:01.432
because at this point,
the only murder

13:01.476 --> 13:04.348
that I would willingly
do time for is hers.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.220
- And then he'd have us
on three bodies.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.439
- Two of them
we have nothing to do with!

13:08.483 --> 13:11.442
She kills Boomer and then
gives us some rando?

13:11.486 --> 13:13.227
I mean, how many bodies
does she have in there?

13:13.270 --> 13:16.665
- Turner doesn't care.
You should have seen his face.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.581
Okay, bye.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.453
- Thinks she's got it all
wrapped up with a little bow.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.194
- What are you doing?

13:30.766 --> 13:32.463
Oh.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.379
- What the hell?
What is she doing?

13:44.693 --> 13:46.913
Oh. Smart.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.441
- Jesus.

14:07.716 --> 14:11.546

but I wasn't actually talking
about a jacket.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.777
Hel--hello?

15:08.820 --> 15:10.387
- This mailbox is full.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.867
- It's doing that thing again!

15:11.911 --> 15:14.087
- Okay.
- What?

15:14.130 --> 15:15.175
- Dude, you've gone full
Favreau.

15:15.218 --> 15:16.437
- You got to chill.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.352
- It's on him, too.
- All right.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.615
- He needs to know.
- I think he probably knows.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.660
- You left him 30 messages.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.664
- Can I please
have my phone back?

15:26.708 --> 15:29.580
I am totally chill!
I am allowed to be not chill.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.800
I'm about to be arrested
for murder.

15:31.843 --> 15:36.283
- And if homie gave two craps,
you would have heard something.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.985
Come on, who doesn't love

15:43.029 --> 15:45.335
- With Jesus, no less.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.383
- Yo, check it.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.432
- I don't know, you guys.
I'm not sure.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.043
You're going to have
to ask him yourself,

15:57.086 --> 15:59.175
because I don't know
if Jesus eats sausage.

15:59.219 --> 16:02.831
But I do know
that he drinks red wine,

16:02.874 --> 16:06.487
and those things go together
great, so probably...

16:15.191 --> 16:17.498
- Not on my watch!

16:22.372 --> 16:24.722
- That bitch moves
like a gazelle.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.691
- Hi, guys.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.046
- How's school?

16:46.831 --> 16:48.877
- Okay, one at a time.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.884
Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.451
- Thank you.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.547
- You don't want
juice and crackers?

17:08.766 --> 17:10.942
We have a tree house out back.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.609
Start talking.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.841
- Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

17:41.147 --> 17:43.540
What's that?
- Ice cream.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.847
- Yeah, other--other freezer.

17:51.679 --> 17:55.509
- Is Daddy with Santa Claus?
- Yep.

17:55.552 --> 17:58.120
And I bet he's met
the tooth fairy, too.

17:58.164 --> 18:01.558
- No way.
- Way.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.778
- Why can't I tell my class?

18:09.610 --> 18:13.527
- Well, because even though
Daddy is in heaven,

18:13.570 --> 18:15.920
he's still helping us.
- How?

18:15.964 --> 18:19.924
- He pays for this house
and your toys.

18:19.968 --> 18:22.579
The ice cream.

18:22.623 --> 18:25.408
And if people knew
that he was gone,

18:25.452 --> 18:28.629
then he couldn't
help us anymore.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.848
Does that make sense?

18:32.850 --> 18:36.637
- Can I have sprinkles?
- Yeah!

18:36.680 --> 18:40.249
I mean, it wouldn't be ice
cream without sprinkles, right?

18:40.293 --> 18:42.425
- Hey, little man.
Where's my sundae?

18:42.469 --> 18:45.341
- Is he my new Daddy?

18:47.822 --> 18:51.782
- No one's ever going
to replace your daddy, okay?

18:51.826 --> 18:53.480
- Who is he, then?

18:54.829 --> 18:57.440
- He's just a special friend.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.921
- Hey, open up!

18:59.964 --> 19:01.792
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

19:03.446 --> 19:05.144
Stupid bitch,
open the damn door!

19:05.187 --> 19:07.755
Let's go!
What the hell?

19:10.453 --> 19:13.456
- ♪ I'll be the hero

20:50.901 --> 20:52.729
Sure.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.080
Thank you, I--

20:56.124 --> 20:58.648
yeah, I just didn't know
who else to call, so...

20:58.692 --> 21:02.348
All right, I'll--
I'll see you soon, then.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.741
Okay.

21:04.785 --> 21:08.049
- Mom, we're hungry.
- Oh.

21:08.092 --> 21:11.052
Well, what are we waiting for,
right?

21:45.129 --> 21:47.523
- Let's get you out of here,
get inside.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.830
Okay, can you get the door?

21:53.834 --> 21:55.923
Hey, here.
Take--take that.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.446
Okay.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.492
Hold on, now.
Wait for me.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.732
I didn't want it to smell.

22:22.776 --> 22:25.866
- Okay.
- And, um...

22:25.909 --> 22:29.391
Jeff used--used to hunt,
so we have--

22:29.435 --> 22:32.655
um, we have a--a meat freezer.

22:32.699 --> 22:36.050
- Well, that
still makes sense.

22:36.093 --> 22:40.359
- Yeah, except he just
got so bloated.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.186
I think that's because, um--

22:42.230 --> 22:46.887
you know, all the gasses that
get, like, trapped inside.

22:46.930 --> 22:52.327
So, then he--
then he wouldn't fit.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.024
- What do you mean?

22:54.068 --> 22:56.026
- I mean,
there was just, like--

22:56.070 --> 22:59.029
like too much
of him to--you know.

22:59.073 --> 23:03.382
At first.
- Oh, no, no, no.

23:03.425 --> 23:06.428
- You know those, um--
those electric knives

23:06.472 --> 23:09.388
like you use at--
like, at Thanksgiving?

23:18.745 --> 23:20.790
Any questions?

23:23.271 --> 23:25.142
- So we call the cops.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.622
- We do?
- Yeah.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.233
- You want to explain that
we dumped the wrong body?

23:29.277 --> 23:31.714
- You'd rather get put away for
murdering a guy who's not dead?

23:31.758 --> 23:33.412
- I don't want to go away
for anything.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.544
- She chopped up her husband
into tiny little pieces

23:35.588 --> 23:37.241
and stored him like
a TV dinner,

23:37.285 --> 23:40.723
then ran over her boyfriend.
She's a "Dateline" story.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.246
She is crazy.
She is, like--

23:42.290 --> 23:44.945
- She's a victim.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.690
Boomer raped her.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.744
- Where are you going?

24:01.788 --> 24:05.661
- He's out there, living it up,
while we take the fall.

24:06.836 --> 24:09.317
He's going to
get us out of this.

24:16.977 --> 24:20.981
- Excuse me.
I want my mommy.

24:27.422 --> 24:30.512
- Okay.
I'll go get her.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.906
You stay here.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.662
- She got a little tied up.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.796
- Hey, Jonathan.
Hey, what's up, Sasha?

24:53.840 --> 24:56.538
Hey, yay yay!
- Hey.

24:56.582 --> 24:57.974
- Hey.
- Heard you made a sale.

24:58.018 --> 25:02.022
- Put an extra three grand
in your pocket.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.851
- What does "no haggle"
mean to you, Dean?

25:04.894 --> 25:06.896
- Oh, believe me,
there was no haggling.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.550
Guy didn't know what hit him.

25:09.769 --> 25:12.119
It-it's not what we do.

25:12.162 --> 25:15.339
Our customers trust us
because when they come in,

25:15.383 --> 25:16.906
they get the listed price.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.518
And what do you do?
You--you go and sell for more.

25:19.561 --> 25:20.519
You're going to
call the guy back.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.694
- The hell I am.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.523
- You're going to give him
a refund.

25:26.220 --> 25:29.310
- How old are you, Calvin?
- I'm 26.

25:29.353 --> 25:32.008
- Let me paint you a picture
of the next 26.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.706
You're going to wake up
with a house full of kids

25:33.749 --> 25:36.186
you have to feed
and a wife who hates you.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.753
And what's the one thing
that's going to

25:37.797 --> 25:40.060
get you out of bed
every single morning?

25:40.103 --> 25:42.845
It won't be toeing the company
line with these other sheep.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.978
- Why don't you take five
in the Wheel Deal lounge?

25:45.021 --> 25:47.154
- People pay
for what they love,

25:47.197 --> 25:49.460
and it's my job
to make them love it.

25:49.504 --> 25:51.767
That's the art.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.510
I can't sell cars
from a vending machine.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.904
- Okay, you won't.
- Thank you.

25:57.947 --> 26:00.341
- Because you don't
work here anymore.

26:03.953 --> 26:06.521
- There's a charge
on my credit card bill

26:06.565 --> 26:08.218
that I don't recognize.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.524
Can you call again?

26:09.568 --> 26:12.701
- Marion, I think
you should sit down.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.269
- Industrial Power something.

26:15.312 --> 26:18.751
Yeah, but that's not
the people I use.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.842
- Leslie's alive.

26:24.800 --> 26:28.108
- This cook top
is driving me crazy.

26:29.283 --> 26:31.590
I can never
get this thing clean.

26:32.678 --> 26:33.983
It's caked in grease.

26:34.027 --> 26:37.813
- Listen, I--I really
need to find him.

26:37.857 --> 26:41.687
- Maybe if--if you really
go at it with the steel wool

26:41.730 --> 26:43.384
like you did the last time.

26:43.427 --> 26:47.997
- Have you seen him?
- Maybe even a sharp knife.

26:48.041 --> 26:50.434
Harold used a chopstick once.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.394
- Marion, did you hear
what I said?

26:57.180 --> 26:59.182
- How do you know?

27:00.793 --> 27:03.578
- I just know.
- That can't be true.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.319
- It is, Marion.

27:05.362 --> 27:08.888
- So he would let me cry myself
to sleep for months

27:08.931 --> 27:12.239
without even so much
as a phone call?

27:14.284 --> 27:16.417
- I'm sorry.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.902
- There's oatmeal raisin
in the icebox.

27:22.945 --> 27:25.644
Take some for your son.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.742
- You know, and now, he's
coming to our place of worship.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.091
You know, when our kids
are there.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.701
I mean, this man
is out of control.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.311
- Is Tara sick or something?

27:41.355 --> 27:42.835
We haven't gotten
our coffee yet.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.837
- He needs to be
put in his place.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.317
- She's usually taken
our order by now, so...

27:47.361 --> 27:48.579
- Yo, can we sue him?

27:48.623 --> 27:49.929
Yeah, for, like,
harassment or something?

27:49.972 --> 27:51.495
There--there were
witnesses there, right?

27:51.539 --> 27:54.194
- Oh, I'm going to have a chat
with him in the morning.

27:54.237 --> 27:56.979
- Yes, see, now,
that's what I'm talking about.

27:57.023 --> 27:59.852
- I'm going in
to be deposed.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.683
- Um, hold on.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.772
What--what about
attorney/client privilege?

28:06.815 --> 28:08.164
- Can they just do that?

28:08.208 --> 28:10.427
- Oh, they can do it
when a firm deposits

28:10.471 --> 28:13.343
30 grand in counterfeit cash.

28:13.387 --> 28:16.042
You're going to need
a good lawyer.

28:35.801 --> 28:39.195
- Can I have another meatball?

28:39.239 --> 28:41.067
- Of course.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.946
- So is this where
we're going to eat?

28:50.990 --> 28:52.731
- What do you mean?

28:52.774 --> 28:56.038
- Like, now that
you're divorced.

29:03.132 --> 29:05.918
- I just thought
it would be nice.

29:19.888 --> 29:23.239
So how was everybody's day?

29:23.283 --> 29:25.154
- Uh...

29:26.765 --> 29:29.071
- Oh, no.
No, no, don't--don't rub it in.

29:29.115 --> 29:32.118
It'll make it worse.
Kenny, go get some club soda.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.853
- How was your day, dear?

30:34.354 --> 30:37.052
- I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.255
- What's up?

31:06.299 --> 31:09.215
- Did you get my messages?
- Yeah, I'm here, right?

31:09.258 --> 31:10.520
- I left 15.

31:10.564 --> 31:13.436
- And a few with
the emoji's eyes crossed out.

31:13.480 --> 31:17.397
- Where were you?
- I was at Legoland.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.702
- Are you serious?

31:18.746 --> 31:20.182
- Yeah, it's
a really nice place.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.358
- You went on vacation?
- Yeah, with my kid.

31:22.402 --> 31:24.491
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah, yeah, it's real dope.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.188
You know,
everything is Lego there.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.408
They got a Lego Vegas Strip,
Golden Gate Bridge.

31:28.451 --> 31:31.367
- I'm about to be
arrested for murder.

31:31.411 --> 31:35.197
That sucks.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.286
- And you couldn't
return a text?

31:37.330 --> 31:40.072
- Hey, I don't work
while on vacation.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.033
- That's what I am?
Work?

31:46.600 --> 31:49.342
- Pretty much, yeah.

31:53.999 --> 31:57.176
- That's it?
- That's it.

31:59.569 --> 32:03.530
- Oh, one thing
you should know.

32:03.573 --> 32:08.404
Your money's cooked.
The feds know everything.

32:08.448 --> 32:11.712
Welcome back, boss.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.291
- Did you see that combo?

32:25.334 --> 32:27.989
- Oh, this is just
way harder sober.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.252
Come on, get in on this!

32:35.518 --> 32:38.086
What are you doing?

32:38.130 --> 32:41.133
- How do you know
if a melon is ripe?

32:41.176 --> 32:43.439
- What?
- Just tell me.

32:45.746 --> 32:47.313
- You smell the rind.

32:47.356 --> 32:51.578
- And how long is milk good
after its sell-by date?

32:51.621 --> 32:53.101
- What--what is this?
- Just tell me.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.060
How many days?
- I don't know.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.713
- You know why that is?

32:58.367 --> 33:02.023
Because you are a terrible
grocery store manager.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.982
- You had to turn the shower on
to tell me that?

33:04.025 --> 33:07.028
- And you're FBI!

33:30.008 --> 33:33.750
I'm going to need you
to say it.

33:39.974 --> 33:42.368
- I love you.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.248
- So what happens next?

33:53.292 --> 33:58.340
- Your friend paid her lawyer
in counterfeit.

33:58.384 --> 34:01.343
And that's going to link you
to the murder.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.130
- I meant with us.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.221
- We'll figure something out.

34:10.744 --> 34:14.704
- If by "figure something out,"

34:14.748 --> 34:18.099
you mean "turn on my sister..."

34:25.976 --> 34:28.457
- We'll figure
something else out.

34:37.771 --> 34:41.688
- Are you guys taking a shower?

34:41.731 --> 34:45.953
- Uh, yeah.
- No, no.

34:45.996 --> 34:49.087
There was a weird bug
in the tub,

34:49.130 --> 34:51.089
and it wouldn't
go down the drain.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.265
- Yeah, we--we almost got him.

34:53.308 --> 34:56.920
- Okay, that's also weird.

35:30.084 --> 35:32.217
- I can do that.

35:35.394 --> 35:38.223
- I put your, uh,
plate in the oven.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.491
The kids are already up in bed.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.107
- Are you okay?

35:57.590 --> 36:00.158
- I don't want to work
for anyone else.

36:01.855 --> 36:04.162
- Me neither.

36:13.649 --> 36:16.174
- So...

36:16.217 --> 36:19.916
what do you want?

36:19.960 --> 36:22.180
- I want to keep my kids.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.184
- I--I found this thing online.

36:26.227 --> 36:29.665
It's called, I don't know,
223, or something.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.494
Anyways, we would rent a place,
and the kids would stay here.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.627
And then you and I
would switch off

36:34.670 --> 36:37.543
every couple of days,
and, you know,

36:37.586 --> 36:40.415
split weekends
and holidays and stuff.

36:42.548 --> 36:43.810
- Okay.

36:43.853 --> 36:47.074
- But we would have to figure
some stuff out.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.773
- Thank you.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.561
- I got fired.

37:00.392 --> 37:03.090
- Those shirts
are stupid, anyway.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.077
- He asleep?

37:34.121 --> 37:35.775
- He's doing that
fake snoring thing,

37:35.818 --> 37:38.430
and I definitely felt action
figures under the pillow.

37:38.473 --> 37:39.822
- Oh, yeah,
them things came out

37:39.866 --> 37:41.302
as soon as you shut the door.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.652
So what do you want to do here?

37:43.696 --> 37:46.089
- When was the last time
we checked these things?

37:46.133 --> 37:47.874
- Um, never.
- Okay.

37:47.917 --> 37:50.180
I'm doing the kids' rooms, too.

37:50.224 --> 37:51.834
- There are other lawyers,
right?

37:51.878 --> 37:54.576
- Oh, um--I also swapped out
the outside lights for LEDs,

37:54.620 --> 37:56.448
so those'll be good for, like,
another five years.

37:56.491 --> 37:59.755
- We got to get one.
- I already got one, babe.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.410
I called the court-appointed
guy back.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.327
- He wants you to plead guilty.
- Hear me out.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.373
- No.
- It's--it's five years max.

38:08.416 --> 38:09.678
If I go in before Christmas,

38:09.722 --> 38:12.202
I'll be out before Sara
graduates.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.379
- Absolutely not.
- I'll still be here in time

38:14.422 --> 38:15.771
enough to teach Little Money
how to drive.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.599
You know that's going to be
an ordeal,

38:17.643 --> 38:19.340
because my man can't even
ride his bike straight, so...

38:19.384 --> 38:21.429
- Can I sleep in your bed?

38:21.473 --> 38:23.562
- No.
- Sure.

38:26.129 --> 38:28.436
But if I get kicked
in the head,

38:28.480 --> 38:29.959
you get kicked to the curb.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.570
- Deal.

I pick up your dry cleaning.

You spend more time
at the doctor--

39:58.526 --> 40:01.181
and who even goes to
the post office anymore?

40:01.224 --> 40:03.052
You know you can just
do it all online.

40:03.096 --> 40:05.925
- Well, I like to visit.
- Thank you, I'm aware of that.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.275

- And you know the worst part?

40:15.064 --> 40:17.415
I was happy to do it.

40:17.458 --> 40:20.287
Because I thought
we were friends.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.550
- We are friends.

40:26.162 --> 40:28.513
- Where is he?
- Who?

40:28.556 --> 40:33.082
- I am so sick of everyone
lying to me.

40:33.126 --> 40:34.910
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:34.954 --> 40:40.263
- Okay, okay, so the--
the Fleshlight is yours?

40:40.307 --> 40:42.831
- What flashlight?
- Not flash.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.617
Flesh, with an E.

40:45.660 --> 40:49.272
- I don't even know--
- Boomer bought it!

40:49.316 --> 40:52.014
There is literally
no other explanation!

40:55.496 --> 41:00.109
- My credit card was stolen
at the salon.

41:00.153 --> 41:03.417
They fired the girl in front.

41:09.815 --> 41:12.034
- Besides that.

41:20.086 --> 41:24.438
I'm sorry.
- I--I think you should leave.

41:58.341 --> 42:02.868
Marion, I thought you might
want your key back.

42:10.658 --> 42:12.878
