01:44.505 --> 01:46.472
         I don't answer
      my phone very often,

01:46.474 --> 01:49.541
  because I am enjoying life,
     so leave me a message,

01:49.543 --> 01:52.144
and I'll probably call you back.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.879
            -Maybe.

   it's your little brother.

 Um, I'm just calling to remind
   you that I'm coming today,

02:01.722 --> 02:04.490
       because, you know,
       dorms are closed.

   I know you don't normally
     check your voicemail,

02:08.262 --> 02:13.332

  to call me back or anything.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.400

04:28.402 --> 04:29.935
You want to hike into the park,

04:29.937 --> 04:32.337
     or go to a sound bath?

04:34.275 --> 04:35.941
 What the hell is a sound bath?

   the sound waves resonate,

04:42.716 --> 04:45.684
   you feel totally fucked up
          afterward...

    you came out here, man.

05:02.903 --> 05:07.039

as partying it up in the dorms.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.341

       over break, so...

05:10.044 --> 05:11.777
         Ah, of course.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.615
     How your grades doing?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.985
   Here comes the Dad phase.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.388

05:37.637 --> 05:38.770

   with the Mom phases, here.

   [Bryan] It all looks good.
 They all look the same to me.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.741
         Wait. Is that
      a race car lighter?

09:36.743 --> 09:39.878
      Yeah. I promise you
       I'm not a redneck.

           -and, uh,

09:42.950 --> 09:44.133
         he was really
        into race cars.

09:44.134 --> 09:45.317
       -Your brother was?
   -When we were kids, yeah.

09:45.319 --> 09:46.318

09:46.320 --> 09:47.852
     -I promise. I promise.
             -Yeah.

09:47.854 --> 09:48.987
      I stole it from him

09:48.989 --> 09:51.590
  when I was, like, 11 or 12.

09:51.592 --> 09:54.125
           He just--
       He let me keep it.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.794
             Sure.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.796
  -After the bet on the race.
        -[Zoe chuckles]

        Yeah, he's fine.
           He just--

10:08.642 --> 10:10.008
     He doesn't like drugs.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.943
        Ooh. [chuckles]

10:13.213 --> 10:14.913
         That's funny.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.681
 He looks like the kind of guy
        I buy shit from.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.684
           [laughing]
      Yeah. Yes, he does.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.687
   I don't know. He's, uh...

10:24.725 --> 10:29.961
 He's just, like, high on life
    or something like that.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.633
         Must be nice.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.836
             Yeah.

10:40.874 --> 10:44.376
   -[Evan] ...but of lenses.

   have anymore weed? Ah.

        Guys, it's late.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.351
Let's get the hell out of here.

 [zippers closing on backpacks]

10:56.323 --> 10:59.090
       [Zoe] Um... yeah.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.993
           [Camille]
     Bryan. Bryan, come on.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.230
        [Nico] How do I
      jump down this rock?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.133
          [Evan] Whoa!

11:09.703 --> 11:11.369
             [Zoe]
      Here, I'll help you.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.272
          -Ready, bud?
          -One second.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.143
So what are you guys doing now?

11:18.145 --> 11:20.812
  Uh, headed back to the place
 where we're staying, I guess.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.180
   It's getting kind of late.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.150
      [Camille] Zoe! Zoe.

11:25.152 --> 11:28.687
     Hey! Did Zoe tell you
     we're renting a house?

11:28.689 --> 11:31.356
          She didn't.
       That sounds sick.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.792
           [Camille]
 You should come back with us.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.827
          -Excuse me?
         -Oh, come on!

11:35.829 --> 11:37.262
     We have a spare couch.

11:37.264 --> 11:40.832
         It'll be fun.
   Peyton, you can come, too.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.300
    We're going to barbecue

11:42.302 --> 11:44.703
         and maybe play
      some drinking games.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.404
            Thanks,
   but I don't drink, either.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.206
         [scoffs] Sick.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.745
       Yeah, I shouldn't.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.414
  My brother and I have plans.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.882
         [Camille] Oh.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.350
             -Yeah.
             -Okay.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.186
          Cool. Cool.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.222
    [Evan] Well, it was nice
          to meet you.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.791
        Yeah. You, too.

         Well, I tried.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.332
     [Max] If you're going
    to invite a stranger...

12:14.334 --> 12:16.935
 [Peyton] I gotta introduce you
     to my biking buddies.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.840
I think you'd really like them.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.042
       We'll take you out
     on the trails one day.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.745

12:31.918 --> 12:34.886
   -Shit, dude. You gotta go.
             -What?

12:34.888 --> 12:37.288
        For fuck's sake,
        run back there.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.824
     I'm not going to stand
 in the way of you and a girl.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.794
     Yeah, but I... I mean,
     this is the only time
     I get to see you.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.929
     We have the whole rest
        of the weekend.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.064
           Go, dude.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.299
      Before you lose 'em.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.270
        Thanks, Peyton.
    I'll, uh, see you later.

  [to himself] Biking buddies.
        Fucking dumbass.

12:58.945 --> 13:03.281
   [Zoe] You and Peyton have
  some unresolved issues, huh?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.150
       What gave it away?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.851
    [chuckles] I don't know.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.319
 Maybe the fact that you chose

13:08.321 --> 13:11.055
         this group of
 fucked-up strangers over him?

13:11.057 --> 13:12.524
             [Evan]
        I took a gamble.

13:15.495 --> 13:19.964
    Ah, thank God.
    We are almost there.
    My legs are killing me.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.533
             [Evan]
      Wow, looks awesome.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.501
     [Bryan] Yeah, it's got
      an interesting vibe.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.903
        Kind of sixties.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.437
 Anyone feeling tequila shots?

       [Evan] All right.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.281
           [Camille]
     Evan, stand over here.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.582
             [Evan]
  So do you only have tequila?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.184
          [Zoe] Yeah.
      Do you like tequila?

13:39.186 --> 13:41.419
   -No, I love it, obviously.
         -Right. Right.

[Sam] And the flight attendant,
     she just stared at me.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.955
         And she said,
 "I think you must be confused.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.191
There was no passenger in 23A."

  That's good. So good. Okay.

           All right.
      New kid, you're up.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.116

   I don't know this website,

14:54.661 --> 14:57.629
      so I'll just choose
         a random one.

       that right though.

             [Zoe]
         Yeah, awesome.

           -[Max] Uh,

21:18.778 --> 21:21.479
       what the fuck were
    you two doing out there?

21:21.481 --> 21:23.581
           [Vanessa]
        Max, your turn.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.783
     -[rock music playing

     -[Nico] Come on, Max.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.786
           [Max] Hey.
  Hey, you guys good or what?

21:33.326 --> 21:34.592
             [Max]
      Where are you going?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.661
           [Camille]
   Sam, turn the music down.

21:36.663 --> 21:39.330
         What happened?
         What happened?

21:39.332 --> 21:42.500
  -Nothing. We thought
  we saw somebody. It's fine.
  -[door locks]

21:44.637 --> 21:47.738
   Did your lame-ass brother
        decide he wanted

21:47.740 --> 21:49.040
 -to join the party after all?
             -Max!

21:49.042 --> 21:51.776
         What the fuck
      are you saying, man?

21:51.778 --> 21:54.578
  I'm just saying he sat there
    and watched us all day,

21:54.580 --> 21:57.081
        and then you see
   somebody creeping outside?

21:57.083 --> 22:00.851
      It was nothing, Max.
  We were just seeing things.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.620
        [Zoe] Sam, turn
       the music back up.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.623
     Guys, just drink more.
  You'll forget all about it.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.792
        -[Nico] Oh, yes!
-[Bryan] Definitely drink more.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.393

             Lame!

22:18.938 --> 22:22.473
          [Zoe] Evan!
   Come take a shot with me.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.741

23:10.990 --> 23:12.390
             Yeah.

23:14.794 --> 23:17.161
         Mm. [coughing]

23:18.931 --> 23:21.732
     I have better tequila
          in my room.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.437

24:48.988 --> 24:50.054
       [to himself] Okay.

24:50.056 --> 24:52.990
         Um, Sam, Tori.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.192
        Bryan, Camille.

          -[rattling]

27:21.674 --> 27:24.675
             -Fuck!
     -Sorry, sorry, sorry.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.410
       Jesus! You scared
      the shit out of me!

27:26.412 --> 27:28.012
           I'm sorry.

27:28.014 --> 27:30.681
         What the hell
    are you doing out here?

27:30.683 --> 27:34.118
      -What's that thing?
 -I don't even know. Just, uh--

27:34.120 --> 27:35.653
          Let's, uh...

27:37.089 --> 27:38.989
     Let's go back inside.

27:38.991 --> 27:43.160
         [Zoe chuckles]
        Okay. All right.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.030
          [Evan sighs]

27:55.341 --> 27:57.241
           [chuckles]

27:57.243 --> 27:58.409
      How are you feeling?

28:00.046 --> 28:02.880
      Like, uh, somebody's
      excavating my skull.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.214
          [Zoe laughs]

28:04.216 --> 28:06.016
         How about you?

28:06.018 --> 28:08.419
          Not too bad,
    all things considering.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.858
   So, back to Peyton today?

28:15.695 --> 28:16.860
              Nah.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.228
  I can't ditch you guys now.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.765
 I had too much fun last night.

28:21.767 --> 28:24.068
    Well, good. I did, too.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.407
      [moody song playing
         in background]

28:30.409 --> 28:32.309
    Are those cooked enough?

28:35.081 --> 28:38.315
       [Zoe] Are you sure
    you had fun last night?

28:38.317 --> 28:40.884
    [Evan] Yeah, of course,
       I had so much fun.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.886
          I got, like,
      no sleep last night.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.159
              Wow.
    You guys waste no time.

28:49.161 --> 28:52.463
      Not all of us start
     the party at 9:00 a.m.

28:52.465 --> 28:54.498
           [Nico] Yo!

28:54.500 --> 28:56.200
       Anyone want to do
    shrooms with breakfast?

28:56.202 --> 28:58.802
       [Tori] Oh, my God!
        Not again, Nico.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.037
             Fine.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.739
             [Zoe]
     Good morning, Camille.

29:01.741 --> 29:04.308
         Mmm! Morning.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.444
         [Zoe] Morning.

29:07.446 --> 29:11.014
   Good morning, love birds.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.517
    -[smacks Evan's bottom]
          -[Zoe] Ooh!

29:13.519 --> 29:15.986
  [whispering] 'Cause somebody
   needed a quick one, right?

29:15.988 --> 29:17.321
     [whispering] Camille!

29:19.125 --> 29:21.225
        [Max] All right,
       finish up, people.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.294
   Try and get to this place.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.029
      Where are we going?

29:26.031 --> 29:27.998
[Vanessa] This really cool spot
         in the hills.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
      You can see,
      like, the whole park
      from this one peak.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.902
             Sweet.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.403
          [Max] Anyone
     who's riding in my car

29:33.405 --> 29:36.106
       has to be outside
        in ten minutes.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.283
        -So, how was it?
          -[chuckles]

29:46.285 --> 29:49.386
      -Come on, let's go.
           -No, Zoe.

29:49.388 --> 29:53.090
  -Got to give me some deets.
        -Camille, stop!

29:53.092 --> 29:55.425
      -[car engine starts]
             -Ugh!

29:57.196 --> 29:58.529
    [Max] Guys, I don't care
   what car you're taking...

29:58.531 --> 30:00.330
       -Seriously, Bryan?
       -...get in a car.

30:00.332 --> 30:03.534
   Five eggs and a whole pack
    of bacon wasn't enough?

30:03.536 --> 30:05.135
    -[Max] Where's Camille?
    -We're going to be late.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.470
       -[car horn honks]
           -Come on!

30:14.914 --> 30:16.513
        [Max] All right,
        we got everyone?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.315
-Let's get the fuck outta here.
      -[Vanessa] Finally.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.284
           Wait. No.
    You're missing somebody.

30:20.286 --> 30:23.153
   It's Bryan. He's in there
       stuffing his face.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.022
         [Bryan] What?

30:25.024 --> 30:26.557
      No, babe, I'm here.

30:26.559 --> 30:27.991
     [Evan] No, the, uh...

30:29.328 --> 30:31.829
  The-- the-- that other girl.

30:31.831 --> 30:34.832
        Um, blond hair.
      She was-- She was--

30:34.834 --> 30:36.300
            [Bryan]
  Camille's the token blonde.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.901
             [Max]
    New guy's a lightweight.

30:37.903 --> 30:39.336
        Has a few hits,
    he starts hallucinating.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.972
         [Sam] I mean,
    it's strong shit, dude.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.108
            I mean,
    your first time, you...

30:45.110 --> 30:46.376
        [Camille] Whoo!

30:46.378 --> 30:47.411
        Ooh, that step.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.847
        [engine revving]

30:54.019 --> 30:56.119
         [Zoe chuckles]

30:56.121 --> 30:57.387
        [engine starts]

30:57.389 --> 30:59.189
        [Max] All right.
      Thank you, friends.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.158
Seatbelts. Everyone, seatbelts.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.926
   Haley, you too. Seatbelt.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.918
         [crow cawing]

31:27.920 --> 31:29.920
            [Bryan]
    That's a jumping cholla.

31:29.922 --> 31:32.656
     [Camille] Why do they
 call it jumping? Does it jump?

31:32.658 --> 31:34.157
            [Bryan]
     The spikes come closer

31:34.159 --> 31:35.459
 toward the heat at the bottom.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.395
             [Zoe]
  Careful of the pointy ones.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.930
            [Bryan]
         Like this one?

31:39.932 --> 31:41.932
        Yes. Oh my God!
    Bryan, don't touch that!

31:41.934 --> 31:43.934
             -Why?
  -Because it will stick you.

31:43.936 --> 31:45.469
           Stick me?

31:45.471 --> 31:47.237
     [Evan] Yeah, I thought
   I warned you about those.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.040
 [Zoe] One time I touched one,
    and it did not end well.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.208
             [Max]
        You touched one?

31:51.210 --> 31:53.110
             [Zoe]
      Oy, that was a day.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.379
      [suspenseful music]

31:55.381 --> 31:57.381
       But, like, that's
   the boring side of things.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.949
        Can we go here?

31:58.951 --> 32:01.385
      I mean, the ratings
       say that that's--

32:01.387 --> 32:03.287
   I know what you're saying,
     but look at that one.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.256
  You're a natural. I'm going
    to go in for a close-up.

32:06.258 --> 32:10.093
     -It's all in the eyes.
     -[Tori] If you hold it
     up to the light--

32:10.095 --> 32:11.995
        You hold it up,
    you can see through it.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.597
       [Camille] I know.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.133
  -I studied rocks in college.
           -Come on.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.135
             [Max]
        Guys, let's go.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.636
        Bryan, let's go.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.438
            [Bryan]
   Shouldn't we go with them?

32:21.440 --> 32:22.606
         [Vanessa] No.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.615
             [Evan]
    It's so quiet out here.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.450
       [Zoe] Yeah, it is.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.454
     It's great for photos.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.960
        [shutter clicks]

32:42.962 --> 32:44.995
   [Evan] Do you think it was
    a good idea to split up?

32:44.997 --> 32:47.331
        [Zoe] Uh, yeah,
    they'll catch up to us.

32:50.536 --> 32:53.270
   My brother tried to get me
 to hike this peak once before.

32:53.272 --> 32:57.307
          Yeah? Well,
   it's famous for the views.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.981
        -[shotgun blast]
        -[Haley] Jesus!

33:03.983 --> 33:06.483
 [Nico] Gotta be from the rodeo
  crowd we saw on the way in.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.285
        [Haley] 'Merica!

33:08.287 --> 33:10.687
 [Evan] What the hell is there
   to shoot out here anyway?

33:10.689 --> 33:12.556
            [Haley]
    Unsuspecting teenagers.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.191
           [Zoe] It's
   not fucking funny, Haley.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.525
             [Nico]
       It's pretty funny.

33:15.527 --> 33:16.593
   [Haley] It's pretty funny.

33:16.595 --> 33:17.761
       [Nico] No, it is.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.399
        -[shotgun blast]
     -[Sam] What the fuck?

33:22.401 --> 33:24.668
     [Zoe] I'm just waiting
 for someone's head to explode.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.604
 [Haley] It's a shotgun, babe,
      not a sniper rifle.

33:27.606 --> 33:30.240
          [Nico] Also,
     like, let's be honest.

33:30.242 --> 33:33.176
They're not going to go for us.
     They would go for Max.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.712
         Sniper's dream
     with that head of his.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.219
         [Sam] I think
      they'd go for Evan,

33:42.221 --> 33:43.720
  seeing as he's the new kid.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.089
             [Nico]
     Oh, shit. Shots fired.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.158
     [louder shotgun blast]

33:48.160 --> 33:49.760
           Literally?

33:49.762 --> 33:53.063
    [Zoe] Don't worry, Evan.
  They wouldn't go after you.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.698
     They'd shoot Vanessa.

33:54.700 --> 33:58.301
       She'd for sure be
the first one to die. [chuckles]

34:01.073 --> 34:03.807
             [Nico]
   We have summited Everest.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.543
            Oh, God!
       I'm out of breath!

34:06.545 --> 34:08.277
         Oh! [panting]

34:10.215 --> 34:13.083
     -[Haley] Intense view.
     -[Sam] Yeah, that is--

34:13.085 --> 34:14.451
        Wow. Tremendous.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.822
            Not bad.
            Not bad.

34:21.693 --> 34:24.226
            [Haley]
       This is beautiful.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.462
    Look, honey, you see it?

34:36.475 --> 34:38.375
    [Nico] So you must come
     out here all the time

34:38.377 --> 34:40.610
thanks to your big brother, huh?

34:40.612 --> 34:42.245
          Not so much.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.514
   I actually try to avoid it
       as much as I can.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.083
          Damn, dude.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.485
   If I had family out here,
        I'd never leave.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.187
          Yeah, well,
    the rocks and the trees

34:50.188 --> 34:52.289
 get kind of old after a while.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.492
       That, and sleeping
   on the floor of a trailer.

34:55.494 --> 34:58.228
           Okay. See,
       what you got to do

34:58.230 --> 35:00.363
is you got to take psychedelics.

35:00.365 --> 35:03.467
   You take, like, a new one
  each time you come out here

35:03.469 --> 35:06.169
          so it's like
  a new experience each time.

35:06.171 --> 35:08.738
      Yeah, I'm not trying
    to fry my brain, though.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.808
  Yeah, ship's kind of sailed
      for me on that one.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.376
       Shit. Sorry, man.
          I'm a dick.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.378
          Your brain's
     probably totally fine,

35:15.380 --> 35:17.147
   lightly toasted at worst.

35:17.149 --> 35:20.617
         You don't know
    how much 2C-E I've done.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.185
          [Haley] Zoe!

35:22.187 --> 35:24.454
     [Nico] What the hell?!

35:24.456 --> 35:26.323
        [ominous music]

35:26.325 --> 35:27.624
       [Nico] Oh, my God.

35:30.662 --> 35:34.231
     [urgent conversations]

35:41.807 --> 35:43.473
           [gasping]

35:51.517 --> 35:52.849
            My leg.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.891
           You okay?

36:00.893 --> 36:02.626
     Christ! Is it broken?

36:02.628 --> 36:05.328
       Max! Where's Max?!

36:05.330 --> 36:06.830
  Zoe, what the hell happened?

36:06.832 --> 36:08.798
   -You just fell. You fell.
            -No. No.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.734
     I didn't-- Wait. Tori.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.903
       [Max] Okay, guys.
     We need to get her up.

36:12.905 --> 36:14.271
    All right. Sam, camera.

36:14.273 --> 36:17.274
     [Zoe] Fuck! My camera!

36:17.276 --> 36:19.910
       [Max] Okay, guys.
    What the fuck happened?

36:19.912 --> 36:24.581
[Camille] You were probably just
 so wrapped up taking a photo,

36:24.583 --> 36:26.483
-you forgot where the edge was.
            -No! No.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.852
 No, I took it standing still.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.688
   One second I was up there,
     and now I'm down here.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.657
   I-- I didn't do anything.

36:33.659 --> 36:35.692
 -We have to get her up, okay?
         -[Nico] Yeah.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.494
          -You ready?
       -Yeah, I'm there.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.963
 [Nico] Okay. Three, two, one.
           Let's go.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.765
          -[Zoe] Aah!
    -Lift, lift, lift, lift!

36:41.767 --> 36:44.534
        -[Zoe groaning]
      -[Nico] Okay. Okay.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.602
   You're okay, you're okay.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.504
      All right. Let's go.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.643
           [Camille]
        It's not broken.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.913
             [Zoe]
   I told you guys I'm fine.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.516
      It's really swollen.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.518
   You gotta stay off of it.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.620
    [Camille] I still think
 we should go to the hospital.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.722
 No. I don't need the hospital.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.425
    If we're going anywhere,
we're going to the camera shop.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.660
    [shotgun blast echoing]

37:10.662 --> 37:12.462
      Fuck! Jesus Christ.

37:12.464 --> 37:16.600
   Okay, so you didn't fall,
    and you didn't walk off.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.001
        So did somebody
       fucking push you?

37:18.003 --> 37:20.637
No. I don't know what happened.

37:22.274 --> 37:23.974
      I... can't remember.

37:27.579 --> 37:31.581
 Okay. Well, I say we go home.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.450
    There's really no sense
      in staying out here.

37:33.452 --> 37:36.019
      Especially not with
  the NRA fan boys over there.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.821
             [Nico]
         Yeah, I agree.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.423
   [indistinct conversations
           continue]

37:42.694 --> 37:44.361
         My car's full.

37:49.801 --> 37:53.870
 [wind building to low rumble]

37:55.574 --> 37:57.941
          [owl hoots]

37:58.977 --> 38:02.345
    [soft rap song playing]

38:14.526 --> 38:16.026
         [Sam whispers]
            Oh, man.

38:19.031 --> 38:22.332
    How do you not remember
        falling at all?

38:23.035 --> 38:24.668
       That's the thing.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.369
      I remember it fine.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.507
  Okay, so if you remember it,

38:30.509 --> 38:34.878
    why do you say you don't
      know what happened?

38:34.880 --> 38:38.848
     It's just-- It doesn't
     make any sense to me.

38:38.850 --> 38:43.720
       It was like I lost
 complete control over myself.

38:43.722 --> 38:49.592
     It was like I was a--
  a passenger in my own body.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.096
          Okay. Um...

38:54.099 --> 38:56.833
   have you been feeling off

38:56.835 --> 39:00.704
      or different lately,
       like, before this?

39:02.040 --> 39:03.673
      What are you asking?

39:05.911 --> 39:07.010
         I don't know.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.012
            Just...

39:12.451 --> 39:13.917
            All set.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.686
   Want to go back in there?

39:18.357 --> 39:19.889
          [Evan] Shit.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.124
     [Zoe] You're limping.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.426
           [Camille]
    I'm not limping. Bryan?

39:23.428 --> 39:24.694
      Oh, my God, you two.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.363
           [Camille]
   Come on, better take her!

39:26.365 --> 39:28.031
        [Zoe screaming]

39:28.033 --> 39:29.599
           [Camille]
     Your foot! Your foot!

39:29.601 --> 39:30.934
    -[Bryan] You all right?
          -[Zoe] Yeah.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.969
     [Camille] Did it hurt?
          Did it hurt?

39:32.971 --> 39:34.738
            [Bryan]
     Jesus, come on, babe.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.506
         You're crazy.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.708
  -I'm going to go get a beer.
          -All right.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.677
           -You okay?
       -Yeah. [chuckles]

39:40.679 --> 39:44.714
      Camille wrapped it,
      and then sat on it.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.962
   [Max] Bryan, are you sure
  you know how to pack a bowl?

39:58.964 --> 40:00.730
         Are you sure?

40:02.901 --> 40:05.802
   Oh, wow, dude, you are...

40:05.804 --> 40:07.404
      You're unbelievable.

40:07.406 --> 40:09.539
           [laughter]

40:09.541 --> 40:12.742
        -[ominous music]
   -Kind of a little massage.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.644
     Ah! Okay, little less.
          Little less.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.813
         -Little less?
         -Yeah, thanks.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.449
            [Haley]
     Try not to tighten up.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.618
             [Nico]
    I try not to tighten up.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.787
        I know. I know.

40:23.789 --> 40:26.756
   [Evan] There's definitely
something strange going on here,

40:26.758 --> 40:28.158
        something to do
      with that guy we saw

40:28.160 --> 40:30.059
   by the Jacuzzi last night.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.861
     [Zoe] Thought you said
        it was nothing.

40:33.064 --> 40:34.964
       [Evan] It wasn't.

40:34.966 --> 40:39.002
  There was definitely someone
  standing there watching us.

40:39.004 --> 40:42.505
    Yeah, your perv brother.
     We've been over this.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.041
 It wasn't my fucking brother,

40:45.043 --> 40:46.776
and please don't call him that.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.215
     I'm having a hard time
         believing you,

40:52.217 --> 40:56.953
   but, so you stop bitching,
  I'll lock some doors for ya.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.858
       [Max sighs deeply]

41:03.595 --> 41:05.562
   This is all for you, Evan.

41:07.966 --> 41:12.735
  Oh, the door is now locked,
      so is the deadbolt.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.538
             Jesus.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.575
            [sighs]

41:19.511 --> 41:21.144
        Door number two.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.545
     [loud banging on door]

41:22.547 --> 41:23.646
             Fuck!

41:23.648 --> 41:25.748
         -Who is that?!
             -Shit!

41:25.750 --> 41:27.650
           [Vanessa]
        Max, who is it?

41:27.652 --> 41:29.219
    [lighter knock on door]

41:32.090 --> 41:35.158
           [Vanessa]
         Max? Open it.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.562
       Come on, open it.

41:39.564 --> 41:40.830
      Just open the door.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.504
           [creaking]

41:51.743 --> 41:53.510
             [Max]
      Speak of the devil.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.612
          Hey, there.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.013
         [Max] Oh, God.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.616
     Peyton, what the hell
         are you doing?

41:59.618 --> 42:02.952
         Hey, everyone.
      Sorry to interrupt.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.855
   Evan, what the hell, man?

42:05.857 --> 42:08.124
I-- I thought something terrible
        happened to you.

42:08.126 --> 42:11.127
     I-- I just-- I'm fine.

42:11.129 --> 42:13.029
   I'm not ready to go home.

42:13.031 --> 42:17.000
   Well, you just-- You spent
 a whole 'nother day here, man.

42:17.002 --> 42:20.703
        I know. I just--
    I can't leave right now.

42:20.705 --> 42:22.071
    We're figuring shit out,

42:22.073 --> 42:24.841
          and I gotta
     make sure Zoey's okay.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.744
     What happened? A fall?

42:27.746 --> 42:29.212
              -No.
  -[Evan] We're fine, Peyton.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.881
      We just-- We got it.

42:32.984 --> 42:34.984
           Hey, um...
        [clears throat]

42:36.588 --> 42:38.121
   were you here last night?

42:39.024 --> 42:40.590
     You know, watching us?

42:41.927 --> 42:43.159
             What?

42:43.161 --> 42:45.194
       No, of course not.

42:45.196 --> 42:46.829
      Of course not. Okay.

42:46.831 --> 42:51.768
      So, um, how the fuck
    did you find this house?

43:02.914 --> 43:05.248
              -Oh!
         -Whoa, relax.

43:07.018 --> 43:08.918
    I have the TeenSafe app.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.722
     It's hooked up to GPS,
so I always know where Evan is.

43:13.625 --> 43:17.160
           [laughter]

43:17.162 --> 43:19.762
             [Max]
         Wait. [laughs]

43:19.764 --> 43:24.200
 Oh! So you track your brother
     like the goddamn NSA.

43:24.202 --> 43:26.235
   Yeah, well, I've had to be
  more than a brother to Evan

43:26.237 --> 43:29.872
  'cause our parents are dead,
          so... yeah,

43:29.874 --> 43:31.341
     I was just checking up
         on my brother

43:31.343 --> 43:32.809
    to make sure he's okay,

43:32.811 --> 43:35.211
      if that's all right
        with all of you.

43:35.213 --> 43:37.981
     Of course. Of course.

43:37.983 --> 43:39.882
   You should bring him home.

43:39.884 --> 43:42.819
      Who knows what kind
 of shenanigans he'll get into

43:42.821 --> 43:45.655
     -with us, right, guys?
         -Max, shut up!

43:45.657 --> 43:48.925
        Evan, you can do
 whatever you want to do. Okay?

44:00.305 --> 44:04.941
          I'm staying.
     Peyton, you should go.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.049
          Okay, uh...

44:16.321 --> 44:19.022
 Call me if you need anything.

44:20.692 --> 44:21.824
            [sighs]

44:24.929 --> 44:26.396
          [door opens]

44:31.369 --> 44:32.835
         [door closes]

44:39.144 --> 44:41.344
         Come on, guys.
       We're on vacation.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.779
     Who's down for shots?

44:42.781 --> 44:44.881
           -Oh, amen!
          -Amen! Whoo!

44:44.883 --> 44:46.082
              Me!

44:46.084 --> 44:47.750
           [Camille]
      Gonna be a rematch.

44:47.752 --> 44:49.752
  [Bryan] Don't have to ask me
        twice for shots!

44:49.754 --> 44:51.120
             [Nico]
    Has anyone seen my hat?

44:51.122 --> 44:52.755
           [Camille]
Let's play some drinking games.

44:52.757 --> 44:54.023
       [Nico] Beer pong.
         Pong this up!

44:54.025 --> 44:55.992
    [Camille] You like some?
            Come on.

44:55.994 --> 44:58.061
           All right.

44:58.063 --> 44:59.796
             [Nico]
        Any hat will do.

44:59.798 --> 45:01.431
           [Camille]
       Get some red cups.

45:01.433 --> 45:03.066
         [Evan] So what
    are we drinking tonight?

45:03.068 --> 45:05.868
             [Zoe]
      Tequila. Obviously.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.370
      [suspenseful music]

45:08.440 --> 45:10.807
             [Nico]
       Okay, okay, okay.

45:10.809 --> 45:14.911
      Vanessa, you are up.

45:14.913 --> 45:18.414
    [Vanessa] Okay, I never
   remember the rules, so...

45:18.416 --> 45:21.217
     God damn it, Vanessa!

45:21.219 --> 45:22.351
   I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

45:22.353 --> 45:25.188
      Um, five, five is...

45:26.791 --> 45:28.391
              -No!
      -Thanks for playing.

45:28.393 --> 45:30.093
         Five is jive.

45:30.095 --> 45:32.128
              -No!
      -Yes. Five is jive.

45:32.130 --> 45:33.396
     You get up and dance.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.298
        [girls chanting]
      Dance, dance, dance!

45:35.300 --> 45:37.033
  Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance!

45:37.035 --> 45:41.037
       Okay. Okay, that--
     That could be a dance.

45:41.039 --> 45:45.007
        All right, okay.
 Zoe, I'm very impatient today.

45:45.009 --> 45:46.743
           You're up.

45:46.745 --> 45:48.778
       -I picked a jack.
      -[Camille] Yes! Yes!

45:48.780 --> 45:52.181
       Never have I ever.
    Put 'em up! Put 'em up!

45:52.183 --> 45:55.051
           All right,
      never have I ever...

45:56.087 --> 45:57.453
        Oh, I have one.

45:57.455 --> 45:59.155
         ...jerked off
     in a public restroom.

45:59.157 --> 46:01.324
           Eww! Eww!

46:01.326 --> 46:03.993
 [Nico] Sam, you fuckin' liar.
     Put your finger down.

46:03.995 --> 46:07.930
      -That's okay, baby.
    -Every guy has done it.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.999
           [Camille]
    Next! Next! Next! Next!

46:10.001 --> 46:12.168
             [Evan]
     Okay, all right, uh...

46:12.170 --> 46:14.270
      never have I ever...

46:15.273 --> 46:17.073
        uh, worn makeup.

46:17.075 --> 46:20.910
     -Oh, come on. Really?
 -[Camille] That one's stupid.

46:22.080 --> 46:24.380
    You are just killing me
           over here.

46:24.382 --> 46:25.948
      Okay, uh, let's see.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.817
      -[Tori] This sucks.
         -Snooze fest.

46:27.819 --> 46:30.520
      Never have I ever...

46:32.157 --> 46:34.090
     -gone down on a girl.
             -Ohh!

46:34.092 --> 46:35.992
     Everybody, down, down,
       down, down, down.

46:35.994 --> 46:38.961
[Nico] Oh, sure, that's the one
   that you own up to. Okay.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.329
          -Miss Tori.
          -Okay, um...

46:40.331 --> 46:42.365
          -Miss Tori.
          -Miss Tori.

46:42.367 --> 46:46.102
             [Tori]
  Uh, never have I ever, um...

46:46.104 --> 46:47.904
         Oh! Never have
   I ever had my dick sucked.

46:47.906 --> 46:49.172
              Ooh!

46:49.174 --> 46:50.940
        [Nico] You don't
       even have a dick!

46:50.942 --> 46:52.542
    It just wouldn't count!

46:52.544 --> 46:54.310
   -How would you know, Nico?
     -She has a huge dick.

46:54.312 --> 46:56.379
             -Yeah.
         -Rando dicks.

46:56.381 --> 46:58.080
           [laughter]

46:58.082 --> 46:59.415
             [Nico]
     Yeah, I'm sure you do.

46:59.417 --> 47:01.217
           [Camille]
        Love you, Bryan.

47:01.219 --> 47:05.922
        All right. Sam,
 master of bullshit, you're up.

47:05.924 --> 47:07.056
             What?

47:07.058 --> 47:08.191
           -[buzzing]
          -Whoa! Hey!

47:08.193 --> 47:10.193
           -Aw shit.
          -Oh, my God!

47:10.195 --> 47:12.929
       -[Camille] Bryan?
 -[Max] What the hell was that?

47:12.931 --> 47:14.564
             [Nico]
   Uh, power outage, I think.

47:14.566 --> 47:16.199
       [Sam] Yeah, scared
       the shit outta me.

47:16.201 --> 47:18.000
          -[Max] Yeah.
      -[Tori] Wait, wait.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.836
       [Max] Okay, well,
       where's the vodka?

47:19.838 --> 47:22.238
  -[Tori] Sam, what the fuck?
             -What?

47:22.240 --> 47:23.940
         You were just
      right fucking here.

47:23.942 --> 47:25.308
       You were literally
        just next to me.

47:25.310 --> 47:26.609
 How the hell did you do that?

47:26.611 --> 47:29.378
          What are you
      talking about, babe?

47:29.380 --> 47:30.947
          -[Max] Ugh!
        -[Tori] What-- ?

47:30.949 --> 47:32.548
     [Nico] Uh, has someone
       got a flashlight?

47:32.550 --> 47:34.584
-[Evan] There's one right here.
          -[Max] Shit.

47:34.586 --> 47:36.085
          Thanks, man.

47:40.158 --> 47:41.958
     I don't see anything.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.359
  Guys, this-- this is stupid.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.494
         Let's just go
   to the front of the house.

47:45.496 --> 47:48.097
-I've been here the whole time.
 -[Tori] Fucking haven't, Sam.

47:48.099 --> 47:49.532
    You were in another room
        playing a game.

47:49.534 --> 47:52.001
   -[Max] He was my partner.
          -[Nico] No.

47:52.003 --> 47:54.403
Well, the breakers are all good,
so I don't know what's going on.

47:54.405 --> 47:56.606
        -You okay, babe?
       -No, I'm not okay.

47:56.608 --> 47:58.507
             [Nico]
 Uh, Sam, little confused here.

47:58.509 --> 48:00.243
        How did you get
   over here so fucking fast?

48:00.245 --> 48:01.911
         What the fuck
     are you talking about?

48:01.913 --> 48:03.546
         I've been here
      for, like, an hour.

48:03.548 --> 48:06.082
   You fucking liar! You were
   sitting right next to me!

48:06.084 --> 48:09.285
         Did Nico spike
    your shit with shrooms?

48:09.287 --> 48:12.054
       We've been in here
       playing two on two

48:12.056 --> 48:13.322
    for the last 20 minutes.

48:13.324 --> 48:17.159
           Me and Sam
    against Haley and Bryan.

48:17.161 --> 48:20.263
 I-I don't know. Did you, Nico?

48:20.265 --> 48:22.098
       What the fuck! No!

48:22.100 --> 48:23.532
I didn't-- Why would I do that?

48:23.534 --> 48:25.301
        -That's not me!
     -Totally would, Nico.

48:25.303 --> 48:26.602
    No, I fucking wouldn't!

48:26.604 --> 48:28.504
         Guys, come on.
      This is ridiculous!

48:28.506 --> 48:30.406
          Okay, wait.
Everybody just shut the fuck up.

48:30.408 --> 48:32.942
        Oh, here we go.

48:35.179 --> 48:37.246
       There was somebody
         sitting there.

48:38.917 --> 48:40.416
     What if it wasn't Sam?

48:42.353 --> 48:43.519
          But it was.

48:43.521 --> 48:45.187
        How do you know?

48:45.189 --> 48:47.123
           We're all
  pretty fucked up right now,

48:47.125 --> 48:49.659
but we're with it enough to know
  somebody was sitting there.

48:50.628 --> 48:51.627
          Nope, nope.

48:51.629 --> 48:53.329
       Oh, babe, come on!

48:53.331 --> 48:55.298
           [Vanessa]
      No. No, no, no, no.

48:55.300 --> 48:58.968
      [suspenseful music]

49:00.605 --> 49:01.971
             [Evan]
     I don't see anything.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.240
         What the fuck?

49:04.242 --> 49:05.641
 No, seriously. What the fuck?

49:05.643 --> 49:07.343
         Someone needs
     to explain this shit.

49:07.345 --> 49:09.145
     I'm getting pissed off
         at all of you.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.446
         -Haley, baby.
           -No, Nico.

49:10.448 --> 49:11.647
  -Should we call the police?
             -Yes.

49:11.649 --> 49:14.450
        -[Max] No! Nooo!
             -Yes!

49:14.452 --> 49:16.619
      No! No. Relax, okay?

49:16.621 --> 49:18.621
    We've all been drinking.

49:18.623 --> 49:20.056
 We're probably just confused.

49:20.058 --> 49:21.490
         -[Vanessa] No!
        -[Haley] What?!

49:21.492 --> 49:23.559
      What if that person
     is still in the house?

49:23.561 --> 49:25.394
           [Vanessa]
    Oh, my God. Can you not?

49:25.396 --> 49:27.229
        For fuck's sake!

49:27.231 --> 49:28.364
            Max, no!

49:28.366 --> 49:30.633
 Sam, you go. Grab that knife.

49:30.635 --> 49:32.168
       Sam, what the fuck
         are you doing?

49:32.170 --> 49:33.469
         I don't know!
        Vanessa told me!

49:33.471 --> 49:35.137
          -[Tori] Ugh!
     -I'm going with them.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.039
             [Zoe]
  I'll stay here with Camille.

        [switch clicks]

49:46.584 --> 49:48.250
      [Sam] That's weird.

          [footsteps]

49:52.223 --> 49:54.724
  [Sam] Yeah, we should check
           the, um...

    [object softly clatters]

49:56.694 --> 49:58.260
             [Max]
         What was that?

50:01.232 --> 50:02.365
          Kick a cup?

50:02.367 --> 50:04.333
 Try not to kick cups, please.

50:07.472 --> 50:09.271
     Okay, this one works.

50:10.675 --> 50:12.174
          [Evan] Okay.

50:13.478 --> 50:15.011
       [cups clattering]

50:17.148 --> 50:18.314
             Uh...

50:18.316 --> 50:19.715
             -Huh!
         -[Sam] Jesus.

50:24.155 --> 50:25.388
          [Sam] Okay.

50:29.127 --> 50:30.326
       [Max] Sam, go on.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.642
     [Sam] Is the power out
         in here, too?

              Oh!

51:14.238 --> 51:15.604
         What the fuck?

        [ominous music]

51:33.324 --> 51:34.723
             Okay.

        -[door creaking]
     -That's fucking weird.

         [Max chuckles]
            Nobody.

52:39.590 --> 52:42.758
I swear there was someone else.

          Oh, my God!

52:46.597 --> 52:48.497

              So?

52:57.708 --> 52:59.508
     There was nobody else
         in the house.

53:02.480 --> 53:05.447
     Jesus, we must be high
         off our asses.

53:05.449 --> 53:08.217
    What the hell are we
    supposed to do in there
    with the lights out?

53:08.219 --> 53:10.886
  We'll stay here. It's fine.

53:10.888 --> 53:13.589
         Not Kings Cup.
    Something else, please.

53:13.591 --> 53:15.824
       Look. Fuck games.

53:15.826 --> 53:18.561
Let's just stick to what we know
        and just drink.

53:20.531 --> 53:21.864
           Ooh. Ooh.

53:23.267 --> 53:24.667
           And smoke.

53:24.669 --> 53:27.670
Have ourselves a little doobie.

53:27.672 --> 53:30.906
         [wind blowing]

53:36.280 --> 53:38.647
      [crickets chirping]

53:48.226 --> 53:50.292
 [wind building to low rumble]

53:50.294 --> 53:51.894
           [rattling]

54:23.361 --> 54:25.261
           [rattling]

54:25.263 --> 54:27.363
           [buzzing]

54:27.365 --> 54:28.697
       [lights clicking]

54:30.268 --> 54:32.401
    [approaching footsteps]

        -[ominous tone]

54:55.459 --> 54:56.925

55:22.520 --> 55:23.752
            [groans]

55:30.961 --> 55:32.728
        [water running]

56:16.107 --> 56:18.440
  [Nico] I swear I didn't put
  anything in anyone's drink.

56:18.442 --> 56:19.942
      Stop bringing it up.

56:19.944 --> 56:21.744
      [Bryan] Yeah, sure.
     Okay, dude, whatever.

56:21.746 --> 56:23.846
             [Nico]
        What's up, dude?

56:23.848 --> 56:25.614
            Morning.
      Made you a bracelet.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.550
         -Thanks, man.
          -Yeah, dude.

56:28.552 --> 56:31.153
           Oh, shit.
   Lights are back on. Nice.

56:31.155 --> 56:32.721
        [Bryan] Oh, God.

56:35.826 --> 56:38.560
         You guys were
  pretty fucked up last night.

56:38.562 --> 56:40.396
Is Zoe's ankle doing any better?

56:41.399 --> 56:42.965
         Didn't check.

56:42.967 --> 56:46.502
      She seemed to sleep
       all right though.

56:46.504 --> 56:47.770
          That's good.

56:49.106 --> 56:50.472
             What?

56:51.976 --> 56:54.009
      Just making sure Max
        isn't listening.

56:56.881 --> 56:58.714
   They were together before?

56:58.716 --> 57:00.816
             -Yeah.
        -She dumped him.

57:02.853 --> 57:05.754
       Then she picks up
 some rando on a weekend trip.

57:06.690 --> 57:08.791
             -Yep.
             -Yeah.

57:08.793 --> 57:11.894
             [Evan]
   Guess I'd be pissed, too.

57:11.896 --> 57:15.631
   I mean, Max does not have
      your insane ability

57:15.633 --> 57:18.500
 to tell scary stories though.
 So you got that going for you.

57:18.502 --> 57:20.002
        [Bryan laughing]
         That's right.

57:20.004 --> 57:22.671
      That was an instant
   panty-dropper, wasn't it?

57:22.673 --> 57:25.474
     Wh-what was it called,
     um, the Five Monster?

57:25.476 --> 57:27.709
   -[Nico] No, no, no. Uh...
      -[snapping fingers]

57:27.711 --> 57:30.446
 -Hissky. It was called Hissky.
     -That's right, Hissky.

57:30.448 --> 57:31.914
     Yo, you got a lighter?

57:31.916 --> 57:35.050
        [Bryan] Hissky.
  Hissky, that's right, yeah.

57:36.020 --> 57:37.786
             [Nico]
        Hissky, whiskey.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.922
       -[eerie music]
       -Do we have
       any whiskey left?

57:44.462 --> 57:45.861
       [lighter clicking]

57:55.105 --> 57:57.973
        [Evan] "Hisji."
     It was called "Hisji."

58:00.811 --> 58:02.110
            Uh-huh.

58:04.648 --> 58:06.248
   I'll be right back, guys.

58:07.718 --> 58:09.117
  You want your lighter back?

58:09.119 --> 58:10.986
    -Yeah, thanks for that.
             -Yep.

58:10.988 --> 58:13.989
      Thank you very much.

58:34.245 --> 58:35.911
         [deep breath]

58:37.248 --> 58:39.748
           [whispers]
  What the fuck are you doing?

58:39.750 --> 58:42.217
      [keyboard clicking]

58:42.219 --> 58:45.554
        [ominous music]

59:30.568 --> 59:33.068
       [glitches buzzing]

59:44.815 --> 59:46.782
      [music intensifying]

59:50.688 --> 59:52.321

59:57.294 --> 01:00:00.329

      [suspenseful music]

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.130
           Fuck, no.

01:01:47.337 --> 01:01:48.470
             Evan?

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.373
             Zoey.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:57.145
     Hey, um, look, so I...

01:01:57.147 --> 01:02:00.315
    I think that I should be
 getting back to Peyton today.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:01.883
        I just think...

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:05.987
           You okay?

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:14.496
      Did you get out here
          by yourself?

01:02:14.498 --> 01:02:18.467
          Yeah. It's--
       It's better today.

01:02:18.469 --> 01:02:20.202
       Right, okay. Um...

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:22.471
          So, I just--
      I really think that

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:26.908
    I should spend at least
   some time with my brother.

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:35.851
        Don't leave me.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.386
            -Zoey...
            -Just...

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:41.757
    don't leave me, please.

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:46.428
         Okay. I won't.

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:52.434
   The boys are leaving soon.

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.772
  They're going to the mines.

01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:59.407
     You go in Nico's car.

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:00.842
      I'll ride with Max.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:02.210
       He's already mad.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:05.914
         Yeah, I know.

01:03:07.184 --> 01:03:09.951
        Um, mind if I go
     get ready real quick?

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:13.822
   Go. I'll probably already
be out there when you get back.

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:16.391
             Okay.

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:28.303
      [suspenseful music]

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:34.476
Hey, can you pack this? Thanks.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.845
        [opening bottle]

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.046

        -[Camille] Evan?
        -[knock on door]

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.458
        -We're leaving.
            -[spits]

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.239
            Come on.

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:06.975
       [Evan] One second.

01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:08.310
          [Nico] Whoo!

01:04:15.586 --> 01:04:17.085
 You picked a hell of a weekend

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:19.421
          to tag along
      with the crew, Evan.

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:21.256
             -Nico?
             -Yeah.

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:23.458
        -Tell the truth.
             -Okay.

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:27.395
     Did you spike our shit
          last night?

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.631
         You dick! No!

01:04:29.633 --> 01:04:33.902
  I didn't! Honest, swear to--
   hand on God, like, Bible!

01:04:33.904 --> 01:04:35.470
           I didn't!

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:36.605
             Jeez!

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:41.042
    Well, then I have to say
        I'm disappointed

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.911
    that we hallucinated Sam
            and not

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:44.913
       -Anderson Cooper.
       -Anderson Cooper.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:47.215
      I do not understand
your fascination with that man.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:48.984
           [whispers]
    God, 'cause he's a god.

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.652
         I don't think
      we hallucinated him.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:52.120
          And I think
     he might be an alien.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:53.922
    -Wait. What did you say?
             -What?

01:04:55.092 --> 01:04:57.392
            [gasps]
      Nico, stop the car!

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:58.560
             Fuck!

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:02.264
             [Nico]
    We're okay. We're okay.

01:05:02.266 --> 01:05:03.999
        Everyone's okay.

01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:05.267
          We're fine.

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:08.203
          We're fine.

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:09.371
       [Camille] I guess.

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:10.505
         [Nico] Hello.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.240
              Ugh.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:17.145
       All right. I heard
  the coolest one's up there.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:21.283
       [Nico] It's fine!
          No one died!

01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:28.924
        [ominous music]

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:30.258
    Where the fuck is Zoey?

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.160
          [Nico] What?

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:34.529
     Where's Zoey? She said
  that she was going with Max.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:37.999
         What the fuck
      is he talking about?

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:39.234
   Yeah, Zoey couldn't come.

01:05:39.236 --> 01:05:41.136
       She couldn't even
        get out of bed.

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:43.371
      No. No, no, no, no.

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:45.240
     She-- I talked to her.

01:05:45.242 --> 01:05:47.976
    She was sitting on the--
         on the porch.

01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:50.679
    She specifically told me
  she was going in Max's car.

01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:53.214
         Okay. [sighs]

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:55.984
       This fool's crazy.
           Confirmed.

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:58.453
     I'm just gonna pretend
     like he doesn't exist,

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.089
    so I can actually enjoy
  the last day of my vacation.

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:02.490
    -[Camille] Max, hold on.
             -What?

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:05.427
        Evan, I saw Zoey
     right before we left.

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:06.995
      She was in her room
         with everyone.

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:08.596
        She was in bed.

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:11.366
  No, she said that her ankle
    was doing a lot better.

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:13.601
           No, dude.
      It was a lot worse.

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:15.403
        That's why Haley
     and them stayed behind

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:17.072
       so they could keep
         an eye on her.

01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:33.221
   How many of them are there
       back at the house?

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:38.593
             Five?

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:43.098
        We've got to go
     back there right now!

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:47.702
          -Evan, wait!
      -Hey, that's my car!

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:49.437
     [Camille] Wait, Evan,
     where are you going?!

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:51.006
        [engine starts]

01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:52.741
            -What--
  -[Camille] Wait! Let me in.

01:06:52.743 --> 01:06:54.642
       What is happening?

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:57.012
    [Evan] Come on! Come on!
    Come on! Come on!
    Close the door!

01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:59.647
       -[engine revving]
      -[tires screeching]

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:03.718
             -Evan!
-That--That story I was reading,

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.687
         -"The Hisji"?
            -What?!

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.790
  -I think it fucked us, okay?
 -You need to start explaining.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.692
       I know this sounds
        fucking insane,

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:13.495
but I think I started something,
      summoned something.

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:15.430
       Okay, can you just
