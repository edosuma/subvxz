00:01.896 --> 00:05.931
.>>PREVIOUSLY ON
"BIG BROTHER": THE SECRET

00:05.965 --> 00:09.310
COOKOUT ALLIANCE WAS SIZZLING,
AND EACH MEMBER WAS SAUTEING

00:09.344 --> 00:13.034
WITH A SIDE DISH.

00:13.068 --> 00:16.965
YOU HAVE DEREK X., I HAVE
CLAIRE.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.241
"X" HAS CHRISTIAN, KY MARY BETH.

00:23.275 --> 00:25.689
BIG "D" DOESN'T NEED ANYBODY.

00:25.724 --> 00:31.034
WITH ONLY 11
PLAYERS LEFT IN THE BATTLE FOR

00:31.068 --> 00:33.758
THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILLION
DOLLARS, I CALL-OUT COMP HAD THE

00:33.793 --> 00:37.241
COOKOUT AT ODDS.

00:37.275 --> 00:41.586
IN THE END, KYLAND GOT HIS
SECOND H.O.H. OF THE SUMMER.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.103
KYLAND, YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD.

00:44.137 --> 00:46.206
CONGRATULATIONS!

00:46.241 --> 00:49.137
WANTING TO KEEP
THE COOKOUT, ALONG WITH HIS

00:49.172 --> 00:53.482
CLOSE ALLIES SARAH BETH AND
DEREK X. SAFE, KYLAND HAD

00:53.517 --> 00:55.896
LIMITED NOMINEE OPTIONS.

00:55.931 --> 01:00.000
NUMBER ONE, CLAIRE...

01:00.034 --> 01:03.137
DIG "D" OFFERED
TO BE A PAWN TO PROTECT HIS

01:03.172 --> 01:03.586
FRIEND BRITINI.

01:03.620 --> 01:04.586
I'LL DO IT.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.206
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH
ME.

01:06.241 --> 01:09.931
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE I
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SLEEP BUT I'LL

01:09.965 --> 01:11.724
PUT MYSELF AS A PAWN.

01:11.758 --> 01:15.103
AND AFTER CLAIRE
INDICATED MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT

01:15.137 --> 01:16.655
WERE ON HER RADAR...

01:16.689 --> 01:18.103
WHAT DO YOU FEEL?

01:18.137 --> 01:21.379
JOKER AND THEN "X."

01:21.413 --> 01:22.482
YEAH.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.965
...SHE
INADVERTENTLY MADE HERSELF KY'S

01:24.000 --> 01:25.034
TOP TARGET.

01:25.068 --> 01:28.379
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, CLAIRE,
AND YOU, DEREK X.

01:28.413 --> 01:32.689
I NOMINATED CLAIRE BECAUSE SHE
TOLD ME ALMOST ALL OF HER

01:32.724 --> 01:34.000
TARGETS ARE MEMBERS OF THE
COOKOUT.

01:34.034 --> 01:38.241
AND I NOMINATED DEREK F. BECAUSE
HE OFFERED TO BE A PAWN.

01:38.275 --> 01:42.379
A NEW TWIST
CALLEDLET HIGH ROLLER'S ROOM WAS

01:42.413 --> 01:43.448
OPEN.

01:43.482 --> 01:47.103
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
TRANSPORTED TO THE BYE-BYE

01:47.137 --> 01:48.413
CASINO.

01:48.448 --> 01:52.413
AND AMERICA GAVE HOUSEGUESTS
50, 75, OR 100 BYE-BYE BUCKS TO

01:52.448 --> 01:53.827
GAMBLE FOR POWERS.

01:53.862 --> 01:55.862
I WOULD LIKE TO SAVE MY B.B.

01:55.896 --> 01:57.241
BUCKS FOR NEXT WEEK.

01:57.275 --> 02:02.689
WITH A CHANCE TO
BET ON A VETO PLAYER AND

02:02.724 --> 02:05.379
POSSIBLY WIN A SECOND VETO ON
THE LINE...

02:05.413 --> 02:08.206
SLOW DOWN <i>
[ BELL RINGS ].</i>

02:08.241 --> 02:14.482
...KYLAND, SARAH
BETH, BIG "D," AND CLAIRE ALL

02:14.517 --> 02:20.172
PLAYED THE VETO DERBY, EACH
EARNING A CHANCE TO PLACE A BIG

02:20.206 --> 02:21.413
BET FOR POWER.

02:21.448 --> 02:23.103
ANYONE WHO PLACES ON THE
BOARD WILL EARN THE POWER TO BET

02:23.137 --> 02:25.931
ON WHO THEY THINK WILL WIN THE
VETO COMPETITION.

02:25.965 --> 02:29.482
IF SOMEONE CORRECTLY BETS ON THE
WINNER, THEY WILL EARN A SECOND

02:29.517 --> 02:31.310
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

02:31.344 --> 02:34.344
TONIGHT, WILL A
SECOND VETO BE UNLEASHED ON THE

02:34.379 --> 02:35.206
GAME?

02:35.241 --> 02:39.068
PLUS, OTEV IS BACK, AND HE'S
JACKED.

02:39.103 --> 02:42.344
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE
JELLYFISH AS JACKED AS ME.

02:42.379 --> 02:46.551
ALL THIS RIGHT
NOW ON "BIG BROTHER"!

02:46.586 --> 02:56.310
OH, AMERICA DOESN'T LIKE ME.

02:57.758 --> 03:01.551
ONLY MYSELF, DEREK F.,

03:01.586 --> 03:06.551
CLAIRE, AND SARAH BETH WILL
PLACE A BET IN THE VETO DERBY.

03:06.586 --> 03:09.586
WE'LL BE ABLE TO PLACE OUR BETS
AFTER PLAYERS HAVE BEEN PICKED

03:09.620 --> 03:10.827
FOR THE VETO COMPETITION.

03:10.862 --> 03:11.758
GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.

03:11.793 --> 03:13.310
YEAH!

03:13.344 --> 03:15.137
GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

03:15.172 --> 03:16.310
GOOD JOB.

03:16.344 --> 03:17.758
GOOD JOB, PLAYERS.

03:17.793 --> 03:21.103
THIS VETO DERBY TWIST IS
HUGE.

03:21.137 --> 03:22.965
THERE COULD BE TWO VETOES IN
PLAY THIS WEEK.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.034
THAT MEANS THAT BOTH OF MY
NOMINEES COULD GET PULLED OFF

03:26.068 --> 03:27.310
THE BLOCK.

03:27.344 --> 03:30.793
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN
WIN AT LEAST ONE OF THESE VETOES

03:30.827 --> 03:33.000
SO THAT MY H.O.H. WEEK DOESN'T
GET SCREWED UP.

03:33.034 --> 03:34.586
GOOD JOB, GOOD JOB.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.206
COME ON, COME ON, GET IN HERE.

03:36.241 --> 03:39.896
I'M ON THE BLOCK THIS WEEK,
BUT THANKFULLY, THERE IS THE

03:39.931 --> 03:41.172
VETO DERBY!

03:41.206 --> 03:45.551
AND SO I'M GOING TO GET A CHANCE
TO BET ON ANOTHER PLAYER, AND IF

03:45.586 --> 03:49.379
THEY WIN THE COMPETITION, THEN I
ALSO GET A SECOND VETO.

03:49.413 --> 03:52.034
SO BASICALLY, I'M DOUBLING MY
CHANCES HERE.

03:52.068 --> 03:53.172
THANK YOU, SIR.

03:53.206 --> 03:55.068
GOOD JOB.

03:55.103 --> 03:56.344
WELL DONE.

03:56.379 --> 03:58.620
EVEN THOUGH I VOLUNTEERED TO
BE THE PAWN, I AM ACTING LIKE

03:58.655 --> 04:02.551
I'M THE TARGET, BECAUSE I WANT
TO GIVE KYLAND TIME TO FIGURE

04:02.586 --> 04:04.862
OUT WHO HE WANTS TO MAKE THE
REAL TARGET.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.896
BOTTOM LINE, THOUGH, I
DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO BE ON

04:06.931 --> 04:08.310
THE BLOCK COMING THURSDAY.

04:08.344 --> 04:11.517
AND THAT'S WHY I PLAYED IN THE
VETO DERBY.

04:11.551 --> 04:15.482
IF I BET ON THE RIGHT PERSON, I
COULD DEFINITELY WIN ME A SECOND

04:15.517 --> 04:16.172
VETO.

04:16.206 --> 04:17.344
BIG "D"!

04:17.379 --> 04:19.931
I DIDN'T PLAY IN THE VETO
DERBY THIS WEEK BECAUSE I DO

04:19.965 --> 04:21.724
FEEL SAFE WITH KYLAND AS THE
H.O.H.

04:21.758 --> 04:25.620
WE MADE A DEAL SECURING MY
SAFETY FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK.

04:25.655 --> 04:27.517
YOU'RE NOT A TARGET OF MINE.

04:27.551 --> 04:29.896
MY END OF IT WOULD BE I'M NOT
THE TARGET OF YOURS.

04:29.931 --> 04:34.620
YOU'RE OFFERING THE NEXT TWO
WEEKS SHOULD YOU WIN EITHER OF

04:34.655 --> 04:34.931
THEM.

04:34.965 --> 04:35.448
YES.

04:35.482 --> 04:36.482
GOT IT.

04:36.517 --> 04:39.862
IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT WE SAY
SAFETY, NO BLOCK.

04:39.896 --> 04:42.896
THOSE ARE TERMS THAT FEEL
GOOD TO ME.

04:42.931 --> 04:47.275
I DEFINITELY AM HOPING TO FIGURE
OUT BOTH LONG-TERM AND

04:47.310 --> 04:48.379
SHORT-TERM FOR YOU AND I.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.379
DEFINITELY.

04:50.413 --> 04:55.034
I DEFINITELY WANT TO SAVE BY
B.B. BUCKS SO I CAN PLAY IN THE

04:55.068 --> 05:02.034
HIGH ROLLERS ROOM IN THE
UPCOMING WEEKS.

05:02.068 --> 05:06.241
SIR, SIR?

05:06.275 --> 05:08.206
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN KEEP
THIS UP.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.931
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE
KNOWS I DON'T LIKE YOU.

05:10.965 --> 05:12.275
I GET IT.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.724
I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

05:14.758 --> 05:17.068
WHY DID YOU PLAY, KY?

05:17.103 --> 05:18.344
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PLAY.

05:18.379 --> 05:22.517
NO, I NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS
POWER 100% GETS USED WHILE ONE

05:22.551 --> 05:26.551
OF US IS H.O.H.

05:26.586 --> 05:31.310
WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THE POWER
NEXT WEEK IF IT'S NOT ONE OF US

05:31.344 --> 05:32.517
AS H.O.H.

05:32.551 --> 05:34.137
SOMEONE ELSE WOULD HAVE CONTROL
OVER THE REPLACEMENT NOMS.

05:34.172 --> 05:35.689
I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

05:35.724 --> 05:36.931
THAT'S THE SMART PLAY.

05:36.965 --> 05:40.034
YOU KNOW, HAVE YOU MADE YOUR
DECISION ON WHO YOU'RE TRYING TO

05:40.068 --> 05:41.000
SEND HOME?

05:41.034 --> 05:46.620
HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO DO THAT.

05:46.655 --> 05:48.931
THERE COULD BE TWO VETOES IN
PLAY THIS WEEK, AND I STILL WANT

05:48.965 --> 05:51.034
TO KEEP MY OPTIONS OPEN.

05:51.068 --> 05:54.310
OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT TARGETING ANY
MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT, AND I'M

05:54.344 --> 05:56.931
NOT TARGETING SARAH BETH OR
DEREK X. BECAUSE I'M WORKING

05:56.965 --> 05:58.103
WITH THEM.

05:58.137 --> 05:59.758
CURRENTLY, CLAIRE IS IN PLACE AS
MY TARGET.

05:59.793 --> 06:03.206
BUT I'M ALSO ANSWERING ALYSSA
AND BRITINI.

06:03.241 --> 06:07.034
I'M NOT REALLY WORKING WITH
THEM, SO THEY COULD BE SOME GOOD

06:07.068 --> 06:08.275
OPTIONS.

06:08.310 --> 06:10.172
THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO
IS NOT GO IN WITH A PLAN AND

06:10.206 --> 06:12.034
THEN I REALLY DO END UP GOING
HOME.

06:12.068 --> 06:15.034
NO, OF COURSE, WE'LL FIGURE
IT OUT.

06:15.068 --> 06:18.172
KY IS LIKE BATMAN.

06:18.206 --> 06:21.344
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S ON HIS
MIND.

06:21.379 --> 06:23.896
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHO THE
TARGET IS, BUT I HAVE TO HOPE

06:23.931 --> 06:26.758
IT'S NOT ME OR ANY OF THE FORMER
JOKERS.

06:26.793 --> 06:29.310
HOPEFULLY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO
BACKDOOR ME AND DO SOMETHING

06:29.344 --> 06:30.137
CRAZY.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.793
I CAN'T BACKDOOR YOU ON THE
BLOCK.

06:32.827 --> 06:38.413
DOESN'T MATTER.

06:38.448 --> 06:44.241
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, THE WAY I
LOOK AT IT, I'M THE TARGET.

06:44.275 --> 06:45.896
CLAIRE IS NOT THE TARGET.

06:45.931 --> 06:49.172
CLAIRE IS HIS FORMER TEAMMATE.

06:49.206 --> 06:51.000
SHE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.

06:51.034 --> 06:53.172
I'M HIS TARGET.

06:53.206 --> 06:56.344
I'M TOO MUCH OF A SOCIAL THREAT
FOR HIM.

06:56.379 --> 07:03.482
IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP UP THIS
ACT AND KEEP LYING TO AZAH AND

07:03.517 --> 07:07.517
BRITINI, BUT I NEED TO MAKE THEM
THINK I'M THE TARGET SO THEY'LL

07:07.551 --> 07:10.586
ACT WORRIED AND EMOTIONAL AND NO
ONE WILL FIGURE OUT I'M ACTUALLY

07:10.620 --> 07:11.379
JUST A PAWN.

07:11.413 --> 07:14.068
THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TWO TO
DO.

07:14.103 --> 07:21.275
IF YOU WIN,.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.758
KY IS CRAZY.

07:22.793 --> 07:27.172
WHEN KYLAND FIRST WON H.O.H.,
I THOUGHT BRITINI WOULD BE HIS

07:27.206 --> 07:28.344
TARGET.

07:28.379 --> 07:29.275
AND AFTER EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED IN THE H.O.H. COMP, I

07:29.310 --> 07:30.793
THOUGHT I WOULD BE UP THERE WITH
HER.

07:30.827 --> 07:34.068
AND NOW BIG "D" IS SAYING HE'S
THE TARGET.

07:34.103 --> 07:35.068
I'M REALLY CONFUSED.

07:35.103 --> 07:39.172
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE.

07:39.206 --> 07:43.000
EVEN THOUGH KYLAND IS IN THE
COOKOUT, I CAN'T SAY I 100%

07:43.034 --> 07:47.724
TRUST HIM RIGHT NOW, AND I'M NOT
CERTAIN IF ANY OF THE JOKERS ARE

07:47.758 --> 07:48.137
SAFE.

07:48.172 --> 07:48.551
WE'LL SEE.

07:48.586 --> 07:49.172
I TOOK A RISK.

07:49.206 --> 07:50.275
I PLAYED.

07:50.310 --> 07:54.517
THE RISK PART IS GOING TO BE WHO
DO I PUT MY BET ON?

07:54.551 --> 07:57.931
SAY, FOR INSTANCE, IF I GET
PICKED TO PLAY IN VETO.

07:57.965 --> 07:59.172
YES.

07:59.206 --> 08:02.241
IF I WERE TO PLAY IN IT AND
YOU BET ON ME, YOU GET TO TAKE

08:02.275 --> 08:03.275
YOURSELF OFF FIRST.

08:03.310 --> 08:08.034
I CAN'T BE NOMINATED, AND THEN
TAKE YOU OFF.

08:08.068 --> 08:12.000
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY SCENARIO
THAT WORKS.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.758
IF NONE OF US GETS PICKED YOU
NEED TO BET ON THAT PERSON.

08:14.793 --> 08:19.034
PICKING PLAYERS FOR THE VETO
COMPETITION IS ABSOLUTELY

08:19.068 --> 08:23.034
INTEGRAL FOR OUR PLAN TO KEEP
ALL SAFE.

08:23.068 --> 08:26.275
BIG "D" WILL BET ON EITHER ONE
OF US, THAT WAY WE WOULD HAVE

08:26.310 --> 08:28.793
TWO VETOES BETWEEN THE THREE OF
US IF THAT PERSON WINS AND THEN

08:28.827 --> 08:30.862
ALL THE FORMER JOKERS STAY SAFE.

08:30.896 --> 08:33.862
BUT IT ALL HINGES ON THIS VETO
PICK.

08:33.896 --> 08:35.241
COME ON, B.B., GOD!

08:35.275 --> 08:36.724
PLEASE MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR US.

08:36.758 --> 08:37.931
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST-CASE
SCENARIO.

08:37.965 --> 08:39.758
I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE THIS
FEELING, BUT I HAVE A REALLY

08:39.793 --> 08:41.413
GOOD FEELING WE'RE BOTH GOING TO
GET PICKED.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.827
FOR THIS COMING VETO, HOW DO
YOU FEEL?

08:53.862 --> 08:55.137
I FEEL GOOD.

08:55.172 --> 08:57.206
CLAIRE IS ON THE BLOCK RIGHT
NOW, AND EVEN THOUGH SHE IS NOT

08:57.241 --> 09:00.620
A PART OF THE COOKOUT, I AM NOT
READY TO LOSE HER.

09:00.655 --> 09:04.034
SO NOW I NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF
THERE IS ANY WAY FOR ME TO GET

09:04.068 --> 09:07.758
CLAIRE OUT OF DANGER.

09:07.793 --> 09:10.310
WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS OF ANYBODY
COMING DOWN?

09:10.344 --> 09:13.379
IS YOUR BEST THING FOR THE
NOMINATIONS TO STAY THE SAME?

09:13.413 --> 09:21.000
HERE'S THE ISSUE.

09:21.034 --> 09:24.448
I'M... CLAIRE AND BRITINI-- ANY
OF THE THREE OF THEM, REALLY.

09:24.482 --> 09:25.758
WHO KNOWS?

09:25.793 --> 09:28.586
BUT CLAIRE IS THE TARGET.

09:28.620 --> 09:31.000
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH CLAIRE'S
TARGETS?

09:31.034 --> 09:32.068
TELL ME WHAT SHE TOLD YOU.

09:32.103 --> 09:36.827
SHE TOLD ME BIG "D," "X."

09:36.862 --> 09:37.448
WHAT DO YOU FEEL?

09:37.482 --> 09:39.862
JOKER.

09:39.896 --> 09:44.551
AND THEN "X."

09:44.586 --> 09:45.172
YEAH.

09:45.206 --> 09:46.448
OKAY, WHO DO YOU THINK?

09:46.482 --> 09:50.137
I THINK SHE WAS TELLING YOU--
I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO KEEP

09:50.172 --> 09:50.758
HER CARDS CLOSER.

09:50.793 --> 09:52.655
CLAIRE!

09:52.689 --> 09:54.034
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:54.068 --> 09:59.068
YOU DO NOT TELL PEOPLE WHO YOUR
TARGETS ARE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHO

09:59.103 --> 10:01.137
THEY'RE ALIGNED WITH.

10:01.172 --> 10:06.344
NOW I'VE GOT TO DIG YOU OUT OF
THIS HOLE AND CONVINCE KYLAND

10:06.379 --> 10:11.586
WHAT YOU SAID WAS NOT ACTUALLY
WHAT YOU MEANT.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.793
CLAIRE TALKS TO ME ABOUT
EVERYTHING, AND SHE LISTENS TO

10:13.827 --> 10:14.137
ME, TOO.

10:14.172 --> 10:15.241
YEAH.

10:15.275 --> 10:26.206
SO IF CLAIRE EVER WANTED TO
SEEK A NOM THAT IS NOT

10:26.241 --> 10:28.724
BENEFICIAL, I WOULD DIVERT HER
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

10:28.758 --> 10:34.448
AND I DON'T KNOW IF BRITINI IS
AS ABSOLUTE AS SHE'S PLAYING US.

10:34.482 --> 10:38.827
SHE KEEPS SO MUCH CHAOS GOING
BETWEEN THE THREE JOKERS.

10:38.862 --> 10:40.827
UH-HUH.

10:40.862 --> 10:46.758
I FEEL LIKE BECAUSE THEY ARE
SO FOCUSED ON HER, THEY'RE NOT

10:46.793 --> 10:48.896
FULLY WITH US BECAUSE THEY'RE
PARTIALLY WITH HER.

10:48.931 --> 10:51.172
AND GOING FORWARD IT'S GOING TO
BE A BIGGER PROBLEM.

10:51.206 --> 10:54.034
BRITINI, NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW
WHO HER TARGETS ARE.

10:54.068 --> 10:56.448
YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH HER.

10:56.482 --> 10:58.275
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH
HER.

10:58.310 --> 11:01.103
TIFFANY FEELS PRETTY
CONFIDENT KNOWING WHAT CLAIRE IS

11:01.137 --> 11:02.275
GOING TO DO.

11:02.310 --> 11:04.206
THIS MAKES ME MORE CONFIDENT
ABOUT KEEPING CLAIRE IN THE

11:04.241 --> 11:05.413
HOUSE ANOTHER WEEK.

11:05.448 --> 11:09.551
SO NOW I'VE NARROWED DOWN MY
TARGETS TO BRITINI OR ALYSSA.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.965
BRITINI IS THE MOST
UNPREDICTABLE PERSON IN THE

11:12.000 --> 11:14.448
HOUSE, AND ALYSSA AND I DON'T
HAVE THE TIGHTEST OR MOST

11:14.482 --> 11:15.724
TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP.

11:15.758 --> 11:22.827
SO I HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS VETO
GOES BEFORE I CAN LOCK IN ON MY

11:22.862 --> 11:24.206
TARGET.

11:24.241 --> 11:27.413
HEY, EVERYONE!

11:27.448 --> 11:29.931
IT'S TIME TO PICK PLAYERS FOR
THE VETO COMPETITION!

11:29.965 --> 11:39.137
YEAH!

11:39.172 --> 11:42.620
ONLY SIX PEOPLE PAYMENT IN
THE HEAD

11:42.655 --> 11:46.310
OF HOUSEHOLD, THE TWO NOMINEES
AND THREE OTHER PLAYERS SELECTED

11:46.344 --> 11:47.724
BY RANDOM DRAW.

11:47.758 --> 11:55.310
WILL THE NOMINEES PLEASE JOIN ME
UP HERE?

11:55.344 --> 11:59.827
AS H.O.H., I WILL PICK FIRST.

11:59.862 --> 12:02.344
RIGHT NOW, I DON'T HAVE A SET
TARGET.

12:02.379 --> 12:05.206
AND, HONESTLY, I CAN'T EVEN
REALLY PICK ONE UNTIL WE FIGURE

12:05.241 --> 12:09.000
OUT HOW THE BETS FROM THE VETO
DERBY CAN IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF

12:09.034 --> 12:11.862
VETOES IN PLAY AND WHO MAY
POTENTIALLY WIN THEM.

12:11.896 --> 12:15.517
SO I WANT TO BIG DEREK X. TO
PLAY BECAUSE HE'S SOMEONE THAT I

12:15.551 --> 12:20.103
DEFINITELY TRUST.

12:20.137 --> 12:20.758
ALYSSA!

12:20.793 --> 12:22.724
YAY!

12:22.758 --> 12:24.034
GO AHEAD, GIRL.

12:24.068 --> 12:25.310
GO AHEAD.

12:25.344 --> 12:28.137
I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT I'M
COMPETING THIS WEEK, ESPECIALLY

12:28.172 --> 12:32.413
BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL 100% SAFE
SINCE CHRISTIAN JUST LEFT.

12:32.448 --> 12:35.517
THIS IS MY FOURTH TIME COMPETING
IN A VETO COMPETITION, SO I

12:35.551 --> 12:37.896
WOULD LOVE TO JUST FINALLY WIN
SOMETHING.

12:37.931 --> 12:41.172
I WOULD LOVE TO PICK TIFFANY
FOR THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT SHE

12:41.206 --> 12:45.068
WOULD USE WANT VETO ON ME.

12:45.103 --> 12:46.827
AZAH.

12:47.862 --> 12:51.862
YAY!

12:51.896 --> 12:56.137
NOW THAT AZAH GOT PICKED, I
AM REALLY HOPING THAT I CAN PICK

12:56.172 --> 12:57.379
BRITINI.

12:57.413 --> 12:59.793
IF I PICK BRITINI, THAT MEANS
ALL THREE OF THE FORMER JOKERS

12:59.827 --> 13:04.103
WILL BE IN THIS VETO, AND THAT
WILL ALSO INCREASE MY CHANCES OF

13:04.137 --> 13:09.482
TAKING MY ASS OFF THE BLOCK.

13:09.517 --> 13:10.172
HOUSEGUEST CHOICE.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.275
HEY!

13:11.310 --> 13:15.103
I AM GOING TO PICK BRITINI.

13:15.137 --> 13:16.379
YAY!

13:16.413 --> 13:21.034
OH, MY GOODNESS.

13:21.068 --> 13:24.758
THIS IS ABSOLUTE BEST-CASE
SCENARIO.

13:24.793 --> 13:27.482
AZAH, MYSELF, AND DEREK F. ARE
ALL GOING TO BE WORKING TOGETHER

13:27.517 --> 13:30.793
IN THIS VETO TO KEEP BIG "D"
SAFE THIS WEEK.

13:30.827 --> 13:33.793
NOW THAT WE KNOW WHO IS
COMPETING IN THE VETO

13:33.827 --> 13:36.827
COMPETITION, IT'S TIME FOR ME,
DEREK F., CLAIRE, AND SARAH

13:36.862 --> 13:41.034
BETH, THE WINNERS OF THE VETO
DERBY, TO PLACE OUR BETS ON WHO

13:41.068 --> 13:43.103
WE THINK WILL WIN THE VETO
COMPETITION.

13:43.137 --> 13:47.275
IF SOMEONE CORRECTLY BETS ON THE
WINNER, THEY WILL ARCHBISHOP A

13:47.310 --> 13:48.551
SECOND GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

13:48.586 --> 13:53.482
BEFORE WE PLACE OUR BETS, HERE'S
A CLUE ABOUT THE UPCOMING VETO

13:53.517 --> 13:55.689
COMPETITION.

13:55.724 --> 13:59.862
OH... MY... GOD.

13:59.896 --> 14:05.344
THE ONE VETO I DON'T GET
PICKED!

14:05.379 --> 14:07.000
IMMEDIATELY, I KNOW THIS IS
OTEV.

14:07.034 --> 14:10.896
OTEV IS A QUINTESSENTIAL "BIG
BROTHER" COMP THAT COMBINES

14:10.931 --> 14:12.344
MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SKILL.

14:12.379 --> 14:14.862
AND ON TOP OF THAT, IT LOOKS FUN
AS HECK.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.793
SO I'M PISSED THAT I'M NOT
PLAYING IN THIS VETO.

14:17.827 --> 14:21.448
SINCE I FINISHED FIRST, I'LL
PLACE MY BET ON WHO I THINK WILL

14:21.482 --> 14:24.517
WIN THE VETO COMPETITION.

14:24.551 --> 14:27.620
I KNOW I WANT TO PLACE MY BET ON
ONE OF MY POTENTIAL TARGETS.

14:27.655 --> 14:31.965
THAT WAY, IF I THAT WIN THE
VETO, I WIN THE SECOND VETO.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.758
BETWEEN BRITINI AND ALYSSA, I
THINK ALYSSA IS THE ONE MOST

14:34.793 --> 14:37.137
LIKELY TO WIN OTEV.

14:37.172 --> 14:37.517
ALYSSA.

14:37.551 --> 14:38.482
OH, WOW.

14:38.517 --> 14:39.758
I DID NOT EXPECT THAT.

14:39.793 --> 14:43.137
DEREK F., SINCE YOU FINISHED

14:43.172 --> 14:47.448
SECOND, NOW YOU GET TO PICK WHO
YOU THINK WILL WIN THE VETO.

14:47.482 --> 14:48.344
CHIP, SIR.

14:48.379 --> 14:51.689
THANK YOU, SIR.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.586
MY, MY, MY.

14:52.620 --> 15:00.310
I AM GOING TO PICK BRITINI.

15:00.344 --> 15:03.931
I BET ON BRITINI BECAUSE IF SHE
WINS A VETO, THAT MEANS I ALSO

15:03.965 --> 15:05.206
GET A VETO.

15:05.241 --> 15:08.413
AND THAT WAY WE CAN KEEP ALL
THREE JOKERS SAFE THIS WEEK.

15:08.448 --> 15:11.172
CLAIRE, SINCE YOU FINISHED
THIRD, IT'S NOW YOUR TURN TO

15:11.206 --> 15:15.620
PICK WHO YOU THINK WILL WIN THE
VETO.

15:15.655 --> 15:18.000
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THIS.

15:18.034 --> 15:19.206
OTEV'S TRICKY.

15:19.241 --> 15:22.034
I AM GOING TO BET ON KYLAND.

15:22.068 --> 15:23.379
ARE.

15:23.413 --> 15:24.379
OKAY.

15:24.413 --> 15:26.517
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KYLAND'S UP
TO THIS WEEK.

15:26.551 --> 15:30.896
IF KYLAND WINS VETO, I'M NOT
SURE WHAT HE WOULD DO WITH IT.

15:30.931 --> 15:36.137
AND SO I BET ON HIM SO THAT IF
HE WINS, I AT LEAST HAVE A VETO

15:36.172 --> 15:39.000
AND I CAN PLUCK MYSELF OFF THE
BLOCK.

15:39.034 --> 15:43.034
SARAH BETH, SINCE YOU
FINISHED FOURTH, YOU NOW PLACE

15:43.068 --> 15:45.137
YOUR CHIP ON WHO YOU THINK WILL
BE THE VETO WINNER.

15:45.172 --> 15:49.551
I'M THE LAST PERSON TO PICK

15:49.586 --> 15:51.379
WHO I'M BETTING ON.

15:51.413 --> 15:55.448
AND MY OPTIONS TO BET ON ARE BIG
"D," CLAIRE, OR AZAH.

15:55.482 --> 15:59.034
I WANT TO BET ON THE PERSON WHO
I THINK IS MOST LIKELY TO

15:59.068 --> 16:01.551
ACTUALLY WIN THIS VETO
COMPETITION.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.931
THEN THE POWER GETS PUT INTO
PLAY, AND I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

16:03.965 --> 16:05.344
ABOUT IT NEXT WEEK.

16:05.379 --> 16:10.034
I WILL PLACE MY BET ON AZAH.

16:10.068 --> 16:12.931
PLACE A BET ON AZAH.

16:12.965 --> 16:15.275
MAN, NO ONE HAD FAITH IN ME
OR YOU.

16:15.310 --> 16:16.137
I KNOW.

16:16.172 --> 16:16.689
LOOK AT US.

16:16.724 --> 16:17.344
WHAT THE HECK!

16:17.379 --> 16:18.793
THE BETS ARE LOCKED.

16:18.827 --> 16:22.068
"BIG BROTHER" WILL LET US KNOW
WHEN THE COMPETITION IS READY TO

16:22.103 --> 16:22.827
BEGIN.

16:22.862 --> 16:24.413
GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.

16:24.448 --> 16:24.965
<i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i>

16:25.000 --> 16:27.517
OTEV, I LOVE YOU!

16:27.551 --> 16:33.103
WITH THIS VETO DERBY, IT'S
ABOUT TO BE INTENSE.

16:33.137 --> 16:38.551
THERE ARE SIX PLAYERS, FOUR
BETS, TWO VETOES UP FOR GRABS IN

16:38.586 --> 16:43.000
THE ONE, THE ONLY OTEV!

16:43.034 --> 16:45.724
IT IS ABOUT TO BE ON!

16:45.758 --> 16:47.344
LET'S GO.

16:58.206 --> 16:59.034
OH, MY GOD!

16:59.068 --> 17:05.862
OTEV!

17:05.896 --> 17:08.931
HEY, LOOK WHO SHOWED UP YOU
LITTLE LAMB LOSERS.

17:08.965 --> 17:12.034
YOU NEVER HAVE SEEN THE
JELLYFISHES AS JACKED AS ME.

17:12.068 --> 17:12.758
ME.

17:12.793 --> 17:13.689
I'M SO JACKED!

17:13.724 --> 17:14.758
LET'S DO THIS!

17:14.793 --> 17:16.620
OH, MY GOD!

17:16.655 --> 17:21.827
SO I WALK OUT INTO THE BACKYARD,
AND THE FIRST THING I SEE IS A

17:21.862 --> 17:23.620
JELLYFISH, AND IT'S OTEV!

17:23.655 --> 17:28.655
CHECK OUT MY MUSCLES, DAMN
IT!

17:28.689 --> 17:33.620
HOW LUCKIY ARE YOU TO BE IN THE
PRESENCE OF SUCH PHYSICAL

17:33.655 --> 17:34.068
PERFECTION.

17:34.103 --> 17:34.586
OTEV IS JACK.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.793
HE'S LOOKING GOOD.

17:35.827 --> 17:38.655
THIS IS PROBABLY THE HOTTEST
OTEV IN "BIG BROTHER" HISTORY.

17:38.689 --> 17:41.379
DO ME A FAVOR, SHOW ME A
PUMP.

17:41.413 --> 17:41.931
COME ON.

17:41.965 --> 17:42.758
FLEX IT.

17:42.793 --> 17:44.241
SHOW ME YOUR TRICEPS.

17:44.275 --> 17:46.034
PUMP UP YOUR QUADS.

17:46.068 --> 17:47.793
NICE TRY, YOU BEACH BUMS.

17:47.827 --> 17:50.448
YOU'LL NEVER BE AS BIG AS ME.

17:50.482 --> 17:53.793
MOVE YOUR WEAK, PATHETIC BODIES
AND GET UP HERE.

17:53.827 --> 17:56.275
HERE.

17:56.310 --> 18:00.482
HEY WHEN I HEARD YOU PLAYED IN
TEAMS, THE ACES, KINGS, QUEENS,

18:00.517 --> 18:04.034
AND JOKERS, WHAT ABOUT THE
JACKS?

18:04.068 --> 18:04.862
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S ME.

18:04.896 --> 18:06.862
I'M SO JACKED!

18:06.896 --> 18:08.896
<i>[ CHEERING ].</i>

18:08.931 --> 18:10.137
OKAY, LANGUAGE.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.620
HE'S SAUCY.

18:11.655 --> 18:16.068
HEY, I'VE BEEN GETTING A
GREAT PUMP HERE AT THE B.B.

18:16.103 --> 18:17.310
BEACH CLUB.

18:17.344 --> 18:21.137
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM, I NEED
MY SPECIAL JELLY TO GET EVEN

18:21.172 --> 18:22.689
MORE JACKED!

18:22.724 --> 18:27.034
YOU PATHETIC WEAK LINGS ARE
GOING TO MAKE YOURSELVES USEFUL

18:27.068 --> 18:28.620
AND BRING ME MY JELLY.

18:28.655 --> 18:32.862
LISTEN UP YOU PUKES, IN EACH
ROUND, I'M ASK FOR THE JELLY

18:32.896 --> 18:36.241
THAT COB TAINS THE NAMES OF TWO
EVICTED HOUSEGUESTS.

18:36.275 --> 18:39.068
YOU SLIDE DOWN THE RAMP AND
SEARCH THE YARD FOR THE JELLY

18:39.103 --> 18:40.310
YOU NEED.

18:40.344 --> 18:43.172
ONCE YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE
CORRECT JELLY, MAKE YOUR WAY UP

18:43.206 --> 18:46.827
THE RAMP, KNEEL ON THE STONE,
AND PRESENT ME WITH THE JELLY

18:46.862 --> 18:48.103
YOU FOUND.

18:48.137 --> 18:53.068
IF YOU'RE THE LAST ONE TO BRING
ME THE JELLY THAT I ASKED FOR,

18:53.103 --> 18:55.241
OR YOU BRING BACK THE WRONG ONE,
YOUR SCRAWNY ASS WILL BE

18:55.275 --> 18:56.413
ELIMINATED.

18:56.448 --> 19:03.310
IN EACH ROUND THERE WILL BE ONE
LESS STONE THAN PLAYERS.

19:03.344 --> 19:07.034
IN THE END, THE LAST ONE
REMAINING AND THE HOUSEGUEST WHO

19:07.068 --> 19:11.689
BET ON THAT PLAYER WILL BOTH
RECEIVE A GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

19:11.724 --> 19:15.931
ARE YOU READY TO MOVE YOUR ASSES
AND BRING ME MY JELLY?

19:15.965 --> 19:22.551
WHO IS READY TO PLAY, "OTEV, THE
JACKED JELLYFISH "?

19:22.586 --> 19:23.793
<i>[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ].</i>

19:23.827 --> 19:25.689
I DEFINITELY WANT TO WIN VETO
TODAY, BUT IT WOULD BE EVEN

19:25.724 --> 19:28.931
BETTER IF BRITINI WINS VETO
TODAY, BECAUSE THEN WE GET TWO

19:28.965 --> 19:31.689
VETOES TO KEEP THE WHOLE JOKERS
TEAM SAFE THIS WEEK.

19:31.724 --> 19:36.689
IN THE VETO DERBY, I BET ON
KYLAND, AND SO THAT MEANS IF

19:36.724 --> 19:39.103
KYLAND WINS, I ALSO WIN A SECOND
VETO.

19:39.137 --> 19:43.931
SO I WOULD LOVE IF I CAN'T WIN
THIS FOR KYLAND TO WIN THIS

19:43.965 --> 19:45.206
COMP.

19:45.241 --> 19:47.206
ALL I KNOW RIGHT NOW IS THAT
I WANT TO TAKE CLAIRE OFF THE

19:47.241 --> 19:50.482
BLOCK AND REPLACE HER WITH
EITHER BRITINI OR ALYSSA.

19:50.517 --> 19:54.931
SO IN THIS COMPETITION, I'M
GOING TO BE SAVAGE TO MAKE SURE

19:54.965 --> 19:59.793
I HAVE A VETO HANGING AROUND MY
NECK BY THE END OF IT.

19:59.827 --> 20:03.655
I'M SO DAMN JACKED!

20:03.689 --> 20:04.931
AAHH!

20:04.965 --> 20:11.310
ROUND ONE, I NEED THE JELLY OF
THE HOUSEGUESTS WHO WAS EVICTED

20:11.344 --> 20:13.275
DURING THE WEEK THE POWER OF
VETO WAS USED.

20:13.310 --> 20:15.724
BRING ME THAT JELLY!

20:15.758 --> 20:17.551
COME ON, GUYS.

20:17.586 --> 20:20.793
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

20:20.827 --> 20:22.724
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

20:22.758 --> 20:27.862
FIND THE TWO EVICTED HOUSEGUESTS

20:27.896 --> 20:30.413
THAT WERE EVICTED IN A WEEK THAT
VETO WAS USED.

20:30.448 --> 20:33.931
I KNOW THAT TRAVIS AND CHRISTIAN
WERE BOTH REPLACEMENT NOMINEES

20:33.965 --> 20:35.241
AND THEY WENT HOME.

20:35.275 --> 20:38.241
SO I JUST HAVE TO FIND THE JELLY
JAR WITH THEIR TWO NAMES ON IT.

20:38.275 --> 20:40.655
COME ON, BIG "D"!

20:40.689 --> 20:41.448
NICE, NICE!

20:41.482 --> 20:43.689
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

20:43.724 --> 20:47.724
MY SECRET, NOT-SO-SECRET
SHOWMANCE JUST GOT BACKDOORED

20:47.758 --> 20:50.793
LAST WEEK, SO I WANT TO WIN THE
POWER OF VETO THIS WEEK TO MAKE

20:50.827 --> 20:52.241
SURE I'M NOT BACKDOORED NEXT.

20:52.275 --> 20:55.137
THE THING ABOUT OTEV IS IT'S NOT
JUST ABOUT GETTING THE RIGHT

20:55.172 --> 20:56.310
ANSWER.

20:56.344 --> 20:59.344
IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE RIGHT
ANSWER AND GETTING IT FAST.

20:59.379 --> 21:01.793
BECAUSE IF EVERYONE GETS THE
RIGHT ANSWER, THE LAST PERSON UP

21:01.827 --> 21:03.620
THE RAMP IS ELIMINATED.

21:03.655 --> 21:10.620
COME ON,s ALYSSA!

21:10.655 --> 21:12.517
KEEP SEARCHING, BRITINI!

21:12.551 --> 21:14.103
KEEP SEARCHING.

21:14.137 --> 21:22.034
BIG "D" HAS PLACED HIS BET ON
ME, IF I WIN THE VETO WE BOTH

21:22.068 --> 21:26.793
GET A GOLDEN POWER OF VETO,s
AND WE HAVE TWO BETWEEN US AND

21:26.827 --> 21:29.724
ALL THE FORMER JOKERS CAN STAY
SAFE THIS WEEK.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.172
DON'T GIVE UP.

21:43.206 --> 21:44.310
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

21:44.344 --> 21:47.482
DROP IT IN YOUR SHIRT IF YOU
NEED BOTH HANDS.

21:47.517 --> 21:48.896
TWO HANDS TWO HANDS.

21:48.931 --> 21:50.586

21:59.724 --> 22:02.551
CLAIRE AND I GET TO THE RAMP
AT THE SAME TIME, AND I CAN'T

22:02.586 --> 22:03.758
LET HER BEAT ME.

22:03.793 --> 22:09.724
SO I KNOW I'VE GOT TO GET UP
THIS RAMP FASTER THAN CLAIRE.

22:09.758 --> 22:10.827
I JUST FALL.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.965
AND I FALL HARD.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.517
I AM TRYING MY HARDEST.

22:14.551 --> 22:17.448
I AM GIVING IT MY ALL.

22:17.482 --> 22:24.241
BUT NO MATTER WHAT, I'M GOING TO
KEEP ON FIGHTING AND GETTING UP

22:24.275 --> 22:25.862

QUIT.

22:25.896 --> 22:26.413

22:43.310 --> 22:54.758

THE CORRECT JELLY IS HONEY
CHRISTIAN AND MINT TRAVIS JELLY.

22:57.862 --> 23:02.206
SORRY, DEREK F., YOU HAVE BEEN
ELIMINATED.

23:02.241 --> 23:03.172
GET OFF MY RAMP.

23:03.206 --> 23:04.758
YOU ARE SO NOT JACKED.

23:04.793 --> 23:08.931
I'M ELIMINATED AND IT SUCKS,
BUT ALL I CAN DO IS PRAY THAT

23:08.965 --> 23:11.137
BRITINI WINS SO I CAN GET A
VETO, TOO.

23:11.172 --> 23:16.344
I NEED THE JELLY
OF THE EVICTED HOUSEGUESTS WHO

23:16.379 --> 23:17.689
WERE ON A TEAM TOGETHER.

23:27.896 --> 23:32.586
OTEV ASKED US TO BRING HIM
THE JELLY JAR OF THE CONVICTED

23:32.620 --> 23:35.379
HOUSEGUESTS WHO WERE ON A TEAM
TOGETHER.

23:35.413 --> 23:40.068
I INSTANTLY KNOW THIS WAS
WHITNEY AND BRENT.

23:40.103 --> 23:44.551
THEY WERE BOTH ON TEAM ACES AND
THEY BOTH WENT HOME ONE AFTER

23:44.586 --> 23:45.137
THE OTHER.

23:45.172 --> 23:47.655
GREAT JOB, EVERYONE!

23:47.689 --> 23:52.206
GREAT JOB!

23:52.241 --> 23:54.310
THERE YOU GO, GIRL.

23:54.344 --> 23:59.965
SINCE BIG "D" PLACED A BET ON
BRITINI, IF SHE WINS, DEREK AND

24:00.000 --> 24:01.241
BRITINI WILL BOTH HAVE VETOES.

24:01.275 --> 24:09.931
THAT IS THE BEST OPTION NEEDED
TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR THE JOKERS.

24:09.965 --> 24:14.137
I FIND THE CORRECT ANSWER BUT
BRITINI IS STILL SEARCHING FOR

24:14.172 --> 24:15.413
HERS.

24:15.448 --> 24:17.896
I HAD IT IN MY PANTS AND HOPE
BRITINI FINDS THE RIGHT ANSWER.

24:17.931 --> 24:27.517
ONE MORE!

24:27.551 --> 24:31.344
AT THIS POINT, EVERYONE HAS
GONE UP THE RAMP, BRITINI IS

24:31.379 --> 24:33.413
STILL SEARCHING FOR HER JELLY
JAR.

24:33.448 --> 24:39.517
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND THROW
THE JELLY JAR IN BRITINI'S

24:39.551 --> 24:47.448
DIRECTION, IN HOPES THAT SHE'LL
FIND IT AND GET UP.

24:47.482 --> 25:05.448
OUT OF THE CORNER
OF MY EYE, I

25:05.482 --> 25:06.724
SEE AZAH TAKE A JELLY OUT OF HER
PANTS AND THROW IT INTO THE PINK

25:06.758 --> 25:07.172

25:07.206 --> 25:07.689
THANK YOU, AZAH.

25:07.724 --> 25:08.172

25:08.206 --> 25:09.310

25:09.344 --> 25:10.275
I AM OVER BEING BOTHERED OF
AZAH'S OVERPROTECTION OF

25:10.310 --> 25:10.965
BRITINI, WHO IS NOT EVEN
INCLUDED IN THE SIX.

25:11.000 --> 25:11.655
AZAH'S OBVIOUSLY THROWING THE
COMP.

25:11.689 --> 25:12.310
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL.

THERE'S MORE DOWN THERE.

30:06.310 --> 30:09.586
I NEED TO WORK ON GETTING SO
JACKED!

30:09.620 --> 30:11.103
I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN
MYSELF.

30:11.137 --> 30:14.620
I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO WIN AND
TAKE MYSELF OFF THE BLOCK.

30:14.655 --> 30:17.034
BUT KYLAND IS STILL IN THIS
COMPETITION.

30:17.068 --> 30:19.310
IF KYLAND WINS, THEN I GET THE
SECOND VETO.

30:19.344 --> 30:21.034
I WOULD RATHER HAVE IT.

30:21.068 --> 30:22.689
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO
DO WITH IT.

30:22.724 --> 30:28.241
I NEED THE JELLY

IF ALYSSA WINS I GET A VETO
BECAUSE I BET ON HER.

30:38.413 --> 30:41.827
BUT IF I WIN, CLAIRE GETS A
VETO, BECAUSE SHE BET ON ME.

30:41.862 --> 30:43.448
I DON'T WANT CLAIRE TAKING
HERSELF OFF THE BLOCK.

30:43.482 --> 30:45.275
I WANT TO ACTUALLY SAVE HER.

30:45.310 --> 30:48.379
SO HOPEFULLY, THAT CAN BUILD
MORE TRUST BETWEEN HER AND I.

30:48.413 --> 30:52.103
SO I DECIDE THAT I'M GOING TO
THROW THIS COMPETITION TO

30:52.137 --> 30:52.620
ALYSSA.

30:52.655 --> 30:54.000

FRENCHIE WAS EVICTED DAY 16.

AND I THINK WHITNEY WAS EVICTED
ON DAY 30.

31:01.586 --> 31:05.103

31:13.448 --> 31:17.448

IT'S THROWING THIS COMPETITION.

31:21.241 --> 31:26.655
I KNOW THAT KYLAND IS OUT OF HIS
DONKEY SUIT, BUT HE IS LOOKING

SAFETY, THIS LOCKS IN BRITINI AS

32:47.172 --> 32:52.827
MY TARGET FOR THIS WEEK.

32:52.862 --> 32:54.827
YAY... I AM NOT HAPPY.

32:54.862 --> 32:58.413
I WANTED ALL THE JOKERS TO BE
SAFE THIS WEEK.

32:58.448 --> 33:00.482
OH, I'M SO UPSET!

33:00.517 --> 33:08.827
NOW I HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO
TAKE MYSELF OFF THE BLOCK.

33:08.862 --> 33:09.793
TO LOSE THE GOLDEN POWER OF
VETO AT SUCH A CRUCIAL TIME

33:09.827 --> 33:11.689
SUCKS BECAUSE NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS.

33:11.724 --> 33:13.758
AT THIS POINT, I'M A LITTLE
NERVOUS.

33:13.793 --> 33:15.689
I'M SO JACKED!

33:37.827 --> 33:39.965
ABOUT THIS HOW, WE LITERALLY
VOTE PEOPLE OUT, AND EVERYONE

33:40.000 --> 33:41.689
HAS TO LIVE TOGETHER.

33:41.724 --> 33:48.275
CLAIRE, YOUR DUKE OF THE DECK
PUNISHMENT IS OVER!

33:48.310 --> 33:49.241
<i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i>

33:49.275 --> 33:55.689
YAY!

33:55.724 --> 33:57.965
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

33:58.000 --> 33:59.206
ONE MORE TIME.

33:59.241 --> 34:00.241
DO IT ONE MORE TIME.

34:00.275 --> 34:02.000
I MISS BRENT.

34:02.034 --> 34:03.448
IT'S A JOKE.

34:03.482 --> 34:09.931
NOBODY EVERY MENTIONS
WHITNEY.

34:09.965 --> 34:15.068
JACKASS, YOUR PUNISHMENT IS
OVER.

34:15.103 --> 34:15.448
YAY!

34:15.482 --> 34:17.034
I'M FREE!

34:17.068 --> 34:18.275
NO MORE SANDWICHES!

34:18.310 --> 34:20.241
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT
MEANS.

34:29.620 --> 34:30.448
HOW YOU DOING?

34:30.482 --> 34:37.206
TIRED BUT PRETTY GOOD.

34:37.241 --> 34:40.758
NOMINATIONS STAY THE SAME,
WHO WOULD YOU VOTE OUT?

34:40.793 --> 34:41.482
BIG "D."

34:41.517 --> 34:42.931
OKAY.

34:42.965 --> 34:45.413
AND NOMINATIONS CHANGE?

34:45.448 --> 34:49.344
I WOULD VOTE OUT BRITINI.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.586
OKAY

34:51.620 --> 34:54.310
THANKS.

34:54.344 --> 34:55.413
I AGREE.

34:55.448 --> 34:58.275
I'M RELIEVED THAT KYLAND
WANTS TO PUT BRITINI UP.

34:58.310 --> 35:03.103
DURING THE H.O.H. COMPETITION,
"NAME THAT CROON," SHE

35:03.137 --> 35:04.862
IMMEDIATELY TARGETED KYLAND AND
ME.

35:04.896 --> 35:07.586
BRITINI, YOU'RE ADVANCING,
PLEASE PICK THE NEXT TWO PLAYERS

35:07.620 --> 35:08.206
TO FACE OFF.

35:08.241 --> 35:10.137
SARAH BETH AND KYLAND.

35:10.172 --> 35:13.586
AND THEN AFTERWARDS SHE NEVER
APPROACHED ME ABOUT IT AT ALL,

35:13.620 --> 35:14.827
SO SHE NEEDS TO GO.

35:14.862 --> 35:18.965
BRITINI IS COMING AFTER YOU,
WHICH IS GOOD FOR YOUR GAME.

35:19.000 --> 35:25.413
SHE'S DEFINITELY TARGETING
US.

35:25.448 --> 35:26.068
OKAY.

35:26.103 --> 35:28.931
ALL RIGHT.

35:28.965 --> 35:30.206
NO, GAME'S ON.

35:30.241 --> 35:31.103
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

35:31.137 --> 35:39.965
AS OF RIGHT NOW, IT WOULD BE
BRITINI.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.103
AND I AM OPEN.

35:42.137 --> 35:46.896
WHEN KYLAND TELLS ME HE'S
BACKDOING BRITINI, I'M TRYING TO

35:46.931 --> 35:50.724
STAY CALM, BUT IN MY HEAD I'M
LIKE AAAAHHH!

35:50.758 --> 35:52.724
MAY DAY, MAY LAY!

35:52.758 --> 35:53.758
ALERT, ALERT.

35:53.793 --> 35:56.241
THIS IS NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP
FOR.

35:56.275 --> 35:59.655
I HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME TYPE
OF PLAN TO GET HER OUT OF THIS.

35:59.689 --> 36:03.275
I WISH SHE WASN'T SITTING-- IT
WOULD BE BETTER IF SHE WAS

36:03.310 --> 36:05.517
SITTING NEXT TO SOMEBODY ELSE,
OF COURSE.

36:05.551 --> 36:06.724
YEAH.

36:06.758 --> 36:09.241
BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING TO
BREAK HER HEART.

36:09.275 --> 36:10.448
IT'S GOING TO HURT HER THE MOST
TO SIT NEXT TO ME.

36:10.482 --> 36:11.655
WE'RE-- WHEN I GET IT.

36:11.689 --> 36:14.724
I THINK IT'S BETTER THEN,
BECAUSE THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO

36:14.758 --> 36:15.103
REALLY CAMPAIGN.

36:15.137 --> 36:16.482
NO, NO.

36:16.517 --> 36:18.689
.KY, YOU'RE A SWEETHEART.

36:18.724 --> 36:20.310
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL, YOU'RE SMART.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.413
STOP.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.862
I'M COOL WITH EVERYTHING.

36:23.896 --> 36:26.793
I THINK WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME
PANG OF PAGE.

36:26.827 --> 36:31.310
, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, I KNOW
DEREK X. IS YOUR BOY.

36:31.344 --> 36:32.586
AND COOL AND ALL.

36:32.620 --> 36:34.379
SO I GET THAT.

36:34.413 --> 36:39.034
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE I JUST GET SCARED THAT IF

36:39.068 --> 36:42.103
HE'S STILL HERE, NEXT WEEK HE
HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIN H.O.H.

36:42.137 --> 36:48.758
AND HE'S SOMEBODY WHO I FEEL
LIKE CAN FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW,

36:48.793 --> 36:49.068
EVERYTHING.

36:49.103 --> 36:50.275
YEAH.

36:50.310 --> 36:53.068
THERE ARE PLENTY OF STRATEGIC
REASONS TO GO AFTER DEREK X.

36:53.103 --> 36:53.965
THIS WEEK.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.413
HE'S A GREAT COMPETITOR AND
STRATEGIST.

36:56.448 --> 37:00.758
JUST INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT AND
COULD POTENTIALLY SEE THE

37:00.793 --> 37:04.448
ALIGNMENT OF THE SIX.

37:04.482 --> 37:08.965
AND RIGHT NOW, HE IS COMPLETELY
VULNERABLE TO A BACKDOOR.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.344
HE'S ALSO MY FRIEND AND SOMEONE
THAT I DO TRUST.

37:11.379 --> 37:14.413
BUT I STILL HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M NOT LETTING MY EMOTIONS

37:14.448 --> 37:16.034
CLOUD MY STRATEGIC JUDGMENT.

37:16.068 --> 37:22.965
I JUST GET WORRIED BECAUSE IF
HE DOESN'T--

37:23.000 --> 37:25.827
I MEAN, AT THIS STAGE IT'S
BETWEEN BASICALLY D.X. AND

37:25.862 --> 37:26.344
BRITINI.

37:40.206 --> 37:41.172
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO

37:41.206 --> 37:43.206
HAPPEN, BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO
BE SURPRISED.

37:43.241 --> 37:44.655
YOU WANT ME TO TELL HER?

37:44.689 --> 37:46.517
DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE
TELLING HER?

37:46.551 --> 37:48.241
I CAN DO THAT.

37:48.275 --> 37:50.241
THANK YOU.

37:50.275 --> 37:55.344
KYLAND ASKS IF I'LL GIVE A
HEADS-UP TO BRITINI REALLY CLOSE

37:55.379 --> 37:59.379
TO THE VETO MEETING THAT SHE'S
GOING TO BE THE REPLACEMENT

37:59.413 --> 38:00.379
NOMINEE.

38:00.413 --> 38:02.310
HEY, BRIT, CAN I SIT BESIDE YOU
FOR A SECOND?

38:02.344 --> 38:03.137
YEAH.

38:03.172 --> 38:05.034
AND I'M TOTALLY DOWN TO DO
THAT.

38:05.068 --> 38:08.344
I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
TO SHOW BRITINI THAT I AM TRYING

38:08.379 --> 38:12.034
TO LOOK OUT FOR HER GAME IN THE
EVENT BRITINI DOES BECOME THE

38:12.068 --> 38:13.827
FIRST MEMBER OF THE JURY.

38:13.862 --> 38:17.931
IF I END UP IN THE FINAL TWO,
MAYBE SHE'LL GIVE ME HER VOTE.

38:17.965 --> 38:20.448
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
SURPRISED.

38:20.482 --> 38:29.413
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE GOING UP.

38:33.896 --> 38:36.620
KYLAND IS A LIAR!

38:36.655 --> 38:37.793
OH, MY GOD.

38:37.827 --> 38:39.482
I FREAKING KNEW IT.

38:39.517 --> 38:45.000
THIS IS ANOTHER LEVEL OF NOT
OKAY.

38:45.034 --> 38:47.689
HEY, KY.

38:47.724 --> 38:48.482
OH, MY GOD.

38:48.517 --> 38:51.413
WHERE IS HE?

38:51.448 --> 38:54.655
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO THAT
AND NOT EVEN TALK TO ME?

38:54.689 --> 38:55.793
APPARENTLY IT'S ME.

38:55.827 --> 38:59.034
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT.

38:59.068 --> 39:01.034
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

39:01.068 --> 39:01.517
I WOULDN'T PANIC.

39:01.551 --> 39:06.206
DON'T PANIC.

39:06.241 --> 39:10.965
OH, MY GOD!

39:11.000 --> 39:15.103
IF I GO UP AS A REPLACEMENT,
HE'S A LIAR.

39:15.137 --> 39:16.655
OKAY, I'M GOOD.

39:16.689 --> 39:18.000
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

39:18.034 --> 39:23.931
YEAH, DEFINITELY.

39:23.965 --> 39:27.379
I WAS JUST TOLD TO COME TALK
TO YOU.

39:27.413 --> 39:32.068
I WOULD SAY THAT WITHOUT
BEING ABLE TO SAY WHAT'S

39:32.103 --> 39:33.034
HAPPENING.

39:33.068 --> 39:37.827
I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE
REASONS FOR THAT.

39:37.862 --> 39:41.482
KY WHAT-- WHAT REASONS HAVE I
SHOWN YOU?

39:41.517 --> 39:43.068
I'VE ONLY BEEN HONEST WITH YOU,
KY?

39:43.103 --> 39:45.862
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING.

39:45.896 --> 39:49.586
WE'RE ALL LOOKING TO-- WE'RE ALL
LOOKING TO GET IN THE GAME AS

39:49.620 --> 39:50.758
FAR AS POSSIBLE.

39:50.793 --> 39:53.758
AND YOU THINK GETTING YOUR
GAME AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IS

39:53.793 --> 39:55.275
GETTING ME OUT OF THE HOUSE?

39:55.310 --> 39:58.275
I THINK THERE'S STILL A VOTE
TO BE HAD, REGARDLESS OF WHO IS

39:58.310 --> 39:58.689
UP?

39:58.724 --> 39:59.620
OH, MY GOD.

39:59.655 --> 40:02.034
WHO AM I SITTING NEXT TO?

40:02.068 --> 40:10.172
THAT IS UP TO WHETHER OR NOT
THE SECOND VETO IS USED.

40:10.206 --> 40:12.275
OH, MY GOD.

40:12.310 --> 40:16.241
KY, I DON'T-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU ON AT THIS

40:16.275 --> 40:17.241
POINT.

40:17.275 --> 40:18.793
YOU'RE GOING TO GO BACK ON THE
DEAL RIGHT NOW?

40:18.827 --> 40:22.965
MY BASIC STRATEGY FOR THE
GAME IS REMOVE ANY VARIABLE THAT

40:23.000 --> 40:24.103
IS UNPREDICTABLE.

40:24.137 --> 40:27.517
YOU'RE CALLING ME AN
UNPREDICTABLE VARIABLE IN THE

40:27.551 --> 40:28.689
GAME.

40:28.724 --> 40:31.758
LET PEE ME TALK TO YOU--
IN THIS GAMES I HAVE BEEN

40:31.793 --> 40:34.758
FORCED TO-- I'VE BEEN ON THE
BLOCK THREE TIMES AND IT'S ABOUT

40:34.793 --> 40:35.931
TO BE FOUR.

40:35.965 --> 40:37.517
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING, BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M

40:37.551 --> 40:39.862
SAYING IS THE UNPREDICTABILITY
SIDE FOR ME.

40:39.896 --> 40:43.793
KY, LIKE... I COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN MORE HONEST WITH YOU, KY.

40:43.827 --> 40:47.482
HOW DOES SOMEBODY KNOW THAT
IN THIS GAME?

40:47.517 --> 40:50.068
I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT THE DEAL
THAT WE MADE.

40:50.103 --> 40:52.620
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOU, KY.

40:52.655 --> 40:53.655
BUT IT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME.

40:53.689 --> 40:54.896
NO, I UNDERSTAND.

40:54.931 --> 40:57.551
ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS THE SAME
THING THAT EVERYONE IN THIS

40:57.586 --> 41:01.758
HOUSE, INCLUDING YOU, IS TRYING
TO DO AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO GO

41:01.793 --> 41:05.068
FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

41:05.103 --> 41:08.103
OH, MY GOD.

41:08.137 --> 41:11.034
WE HAD A DEAL!

41:11.068 --> 41:12.862
ON NOT BEING TOUCHED!

41:12.896 --> 41:16.724
AND THEN YOU GET BACK ON IT LIKE
AN ARROGANT LITTLE BITCH!

41:16.758 --> 41:19.482
NO, I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT!

41:19.517 --> 41:27.758
I AM SORRY, BRITINI.

41:27.793 --> 41:32.000
THE HEARTACHE I FEEL FOR
BRITINI, SEEING HER IN SUCH

41:32.034 --> 41:37.137
ANGUISH DOES MAKE ME WONDER IF
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.

41:37.172 --> 41:40.137
I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF
PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAYBE

41:40.172 --> 41:45.275
SEE ME BACKDOOR DEREK X. INSTEAD
OF BRITINI.

41:45.310 --> 41:47.413
IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING I
HAVE THOUGHT OF.

41:47.448 --> 41:48.172
IT'S TOUGH.

41:48.206 --> 41:53.034
GIVEE MOO A SECOND.

41:53.068 --> 41:56.724
I KNOW I'M GOING TO FIGHT
LIKE HELL TO STAY IN THIS HOUSE

41:56.758 --> 41:58.758
BECAUSE I KNOW WHO I AM AS A
PERSON!

41:58.793 --> 42:01.931
AND NONE OF THEM KNOW HOW MANY
BLACK BELTS I HAVE, BUT THEY ARE

42:01.965 --> 42:05.034
ABOUT TO SEE THE FOURTH DEGREE
BLACK BELT COME OUT.

42:05.068 --> 42:09.655
I SWEAR TO GOD, I WILL MAKE HELL
BREAK LOSE IN THIS HOUSE BEFORE

42:09.689 --> 42:10.310
I LEAVE.

42:10.344 --> 42:12.137
NO WAY I'M GOING OUT SILENT.

42:12.172 --> 42:13.068
IS BRITINI'S
FATE SEALED OR WILL THE TWO

42:13.103 --> 42:16.310
VETOES SHAKE UP THE GAME IN
UNEXPECT WAYS?

42:16.344 --> 42:22.344
FIND OUT TOMORROW NIGHT ON "BIG
BROTHER"!
