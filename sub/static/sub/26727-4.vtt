00:02.627 --> 00:03.461
I like you...

00:32.365 --> 00:33.575
I like you.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.619
Wait, Mr. Anzai!

00:40.123 --> 00:42.333
Hey! What's the matter, Anzai?

00:42.667 --> 00:43.585
Let's go, Yanagi.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.713
-Jill, wait here.
-What? Why?

00:48.214 --> 00:49.966
Your kind are the murderers!

00:53.052 --> 00:55.305
My mother died because of you!

00:55.513 --> 00:57.891
If vampires didn't exist,
she would still be alive!

00:59.059 --> 00:59.976
Shit!

01:06.483 --> 01:08.193
You're unexpectedly weak.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.278
Are you an ordinary human?

01:11.279 --> 01:13.531
Wow, I think she blew your lungs out!

01:14.991 --> 01:16.951
If I leave you like this, you'll die.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.537
You're losing so much blood,
we have to fix your lungs now.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.372
I'll give you this, for now.

01:21.998 --> 01:25.376
About 200ml should be enough
to restore your internal organs.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.923
Nothing can heal better
than human blood, after all.

01:30.632 --> 01:31.966
Stop it!

01:32.509 --> 01:36.221
I don't need it.

01:49.984 --> 01:50.902
Where am I?

01:51.611 --> 01:52.695
This is...

01:54.114 --> 01:56.783
a place I've been to before.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.207
Hey, you! Are you friends with that guy?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.375
Not really.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.752
Just a passerby who saved his life.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.796
I only gave him some human blood.

02:10.046 --> 02:12.257
Human blood? Another vampire?

02:14.050 --> 02:16.052
Don't get me wrong, I bought it.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.720
From the owner, even.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.181
You think I would believe
the words of a vampire?

02:20.640 --> 02:23.184
That man, that vampire,

02:23.935 --> 02:26.437
he acted like he loved my mother.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.774
Then he drank her blood,

02:30.150 --> 02:31.234
while violating her!

02:34.654 --> 02:37.574
You know, I think you're looking
at this the wrong way.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.161
Basically, your mother's boyfriend
was a scumbag

02:41.578 --> 02:44.414
who just happened to be
a vampire, that's all.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.460
It's not just a single factor
that leads people to crime.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.797
It's the environment they are raised in,
the things that interest them,

02:52.881 --> 02:55.133
even the people they're surrounded with.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.845
There are many contributing factors
that caused his actions.

02:59.512 --> 03:04.100
In other words, seeing all of us
as criminals without a basis

03:04.183 --> 03:05.852
is just hasty.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.370
Are you scared? They're vampires.
Just like you.

03:24.579 --> 03:29.167
I'm not. I'm only a half-vampire.
I'm not anything like...

03:31.044 --> 03:33.296
Not another word, filthy vampire!

03:34.005 --> 03:37.508
If you weren't a vampire,
you wouldn't have done something horrible.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.848
Blood!

03:44.140 --> 03:47.560
-Blood!
-Blood!

03:47.727 --> 03:50.313
-Give me blood!
-I want blood!

03:50.647 --> 03:53.900
I'm not like them!

03:58.988 --> 04:02.242
People are cruel, too, you know.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.058
So, Anzai ran off by himself?

05:50.475 --> 05:51.350
Yes, sir.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.144
He must be after the sniper.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.065
Or he ran because I was bleeding.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.317
He was crying.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.861
What should I do? It's all my fault.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.156
I have to do something.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.200
What is this all of a sudden?

06:08.367 --> 06:09.243
No way!

06:09.952 --> 06:11.204
Sawazaki, hurry!

06:11.287 --> 06:12.914
We need to find Anzai quickly!

06:14.540 --> 06:17.168
Please, wait! I'm coming, too!

06:48.908 --> 06:51.244
Anzai didn't lick your blood, right?

06:51.828 --> 06:52.912
No, he didn't.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.831
He restrained himself.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.458
Really? Then there's still hope.

06:58.751 --> 07:02.380
Maybe if he sees me,
he'll come to his senses.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.091
Hey, what's that sound?

07:06.342 --> 07:07.802
Did you see his ring?

07:08.010 --> 07:11.472
I've been using it to monitor
his temperature, in case of emergencies.

07:11.973 --> 07:15.518
The sound is a warning that Anzai's
temperature is over 39 degrees Celsius.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.564
It's ordinarily 27 degrees Celsius,
and now it's 39?

07:20.231 --> 07:23.484
There's only one explanation for this.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.071
He must have consumed
a lot of human blood.

07:28.322 --> 07:31.075
If this continues and his body temperature
keeps rising,

07:31.701 --> 07:34.745
his brain and internal organs
will suffer permanent damage.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.373
Worst case scenario, he may even die.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.001
Die? Anzai?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.252
Oh, no.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.172
We have to find him before that happens.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.966
I've never seen this happen before.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.681
Hey, calm down a little.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.643
Still no good?

07:57.852 --> 08:01.189
After healing your wounds,
the blood really went to your head.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.112
Monsters!

08:13.451 --> 08:14.952
This is only a theory,

08:15.203 --> 08:18.289
but the culprit may be identifying
vampires by their body temperature.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.334
With thermography, it's pretty obvious.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.046
Are you sure Anzai drank human blood?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.507
I also thought it was impossible.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.218
But because he kept himself
from drinking Ms. Taira's blood,

08:30.301 --> 08:32.637
it's possible that his desire
for blood increased.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.223
I knew it. It's my fault.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.101
If that's really the case,
we have to use tranquilizers.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.354
Why tranquilizers and not a sedative?

08:41.646 --> 08:44.482
Sedative is a medicine,
tranquilizer is a weapon.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.860
Only the police are permitted to use it
on violent vampire suspects.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.403
What do you mean by suspects?

08:49.779 --> 08:52.532
It can't be helped. Even a partner
who has drunk blood can be dangerous.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.326
Many vampires target young women.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.290
What was that just now?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.126
That pain I felt?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.744
Are you okay, Zero-Seven?

09:38.953 --> 09:39.870
Fifteen!

09:44.250 --> 09:45.167
Monster.

09:48.462 --> 09:49.422
Get out of here!

09:53.259 --> 09:55.553
We're arriving! It's right there!

09:56.137 --> 09:57.138
The next corner!

10:13.029 --> 10:15.031
Don't drink her blood, Mr. Anzai!

10:37.845 --> 10:38.763
Mr. Anzai...

10:41.641 --> 10:42.725
Hey, stop!

10:47.063 --> 10:48.147
Requesting backup.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.315
We're under fire.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.234
It's the shooter we were looking for
and what appears to be her accomplice.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.486
They have a rifle and a pistol!

10:54.779 --> 10:55.946
Hey, look!

11:04.664 --> 11:05.581
Jill!

11:06.791 --> 11:07.875
What happened to you?

11:08.459 --> 11:10.878
-Hey, I told you to wait--
-Don't give me that crap!

11:11.379 --> 11:13.964
You expect me to sit around
and wait for my colleague to die?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.509
Sorry, but I heard it all.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.803
Only a vampire can fight another vampire.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.930
If you don't dispatch me
in times like these,

11:21.055 --> 11:22.723
what's the point
of having vampire officers?

11:24.225 --> 11:25.851
Snap out of it, Yuki!

11:30.689 --> 11:33.150
So much for backup.
She can't even get close to him.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.903
Is she the one who shot Anzai?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.531
But it doesn't look
like he drank her blood.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.158
Then whose blood did Anzai drink?

11:42.827 --> 11:45.413
I fed him some human blood.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.706
He got shot in the chest. He almost died.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.292
Because of him, I don't have any left.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.837
He only has one red eye?

11:53.421 --> 11:55.798
Who are you? Also, what's with your eye?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.759
Lee Hans. I'm half-human, half-vampire.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.804
-What?
-Half-vampire? Like Mr. Anzai?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.640
Anzai, the guy with black hair?

12:04.932 --> 12:07.393
He isn't from Hokkaido, is he?

12:07.476 --> 12:08.811
What? How did you know?

12:10.271 --> 12:13.524
I never thought I would meet
another half-vampire in the outside world.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.031
Jill!

12:21.115 --> 12:22.783
Even another vampire can't stop him.

12:23.159 --> 12:27.663
Vampires who have just fed
are stronger than those who haven't.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.747
Hey!

12:31.876 --> 12:36.213
I just wanted to heal his wounds,
but it somehow came to this.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.632
I really didn't expect this.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.468
But I guess it can't be helped.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.971
He doesn't have
a high tolerance for blood.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.851
What should I do?
If we don't do anything, Anzai will...

12:59.361 --> 13:01.447
No, stop.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.240
Don't!

13:08.621 --> 13:10.206
Mr. Anzai!

13:22.635 --> 13:25.054
I guess I'm going to...

13:31.810 --> 13:33.395
We could have...

13:40.903 --> 13:42.571
What are you doing?

13:44.532 --> 13:45.699
You know you'll die, right?

13:47.660 --> 13:48.577
Get back!

13:55.793 --> 13:56.669
Shit!

14:00.464 --> 14:01.465
Isn't that him?

14:01.882 --> 14:02.925
We have arrived at the scene.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.761
It's one of the suspects
from the witness reports.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.263
Wait, he's not...

14:07.638 --> 14:10.307
I don't really want to get mixed up
with the police.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.583
Zero-Seven has failed.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.003
We're proceeding to Plan B.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.764
It's been two weeks since that day.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.936
Mr. Anzai doesn't visit me anymore.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.191
MIWAKO TODA

15:01.275 --> 15:03.235
HEY! HOW ARE YOU?
HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOUR LOVER?

15:04.445 --> 15:06.196
Of course, he won't contact me.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.117
We didn't exchange numbers or anything.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.163
IT'S LATE, BUT MERRY CHRISTMAS

15:17.583 --> 15:19.418
Will he ever come back?

15:22.087 --> 15:23.172
CLOSED FOR TODAY

15:28.385 --> 15:29.428
MIKUSA BUILDING

15:34.516 --> 15:35.851
Why won't he come back?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.315
This is the last place I saw Mr. Anzai.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.820
This is the only place I know
I can look for him.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.628
You're that guy from before.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.005
Hey, that's right.
It's nice to see you here.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.383
So, hey, have you seen my cross?

16:07.758 --> 16:09.843
I think I dropped it around here that day.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.555
So, what are you up to?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.733
He hasn't come to see me since then.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.735
And I don't know how to contact him.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.989
Well, I don't blame him.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.492
You jumped in front of a vampire.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.911
Try putting yourself in his shoes.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.540
You would be surprised by the number
of vampires who have lost control,

16:39.832 --> 16:41.667
killed their loved ones,

16:41.750 --> 16:44.253
and, in despair, ended up
killing themselves.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.755
That's a good point.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.800
I've only been thinking about myself.

16:51.677 --> 16:57.516
When it comes to Mr. Anzai and vampires,
I really don't know anything.

17:01.437 --> 17:05.107
But if I ask him,
maybe I could learn a few things.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.609
Hey,

17:08.318 --> 17:09.903
can I see your left eye?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.116
Why is it only your left eye?

17:14.408 --> 17:16.368
What a geeky reaction.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.162
This eye doesn't scare you?

17:21.457 --> 17:23.333
The guy I like is a vampire, so...

17:25.669 --> 17:28.338
The guy you like? You mean Anzai?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.675
Bull's-eye! Are you dating?

17:31.884 --> 17:34.553
No, it's not like that.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.015
I like you.

17:39.308 --> 17:43.228
If I tell him I like him too,
maybe we could start dating.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.190
Wait, so he's just waiting
to hear how you feel?

17:46.356 --> 17:47.483
When will you tell him?

17:48.150 --> 17:50.736
Oh, right. You can't get a hold of him.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.572
It's just like what you said.

17:54.364 --> 17:57.576
Maybe what happened
two weeks ago is bothering him.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.412
That was the worst I've seen him.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.207
He also almost attacked me.

18:06.376 --> 18:09.588
Hey, Anzai, how long are you going
to coop yourself up in there?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.884
Your suspension ends tomorrow.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.428
We're catching up at the bar downstairs
at around 6:00 p.m.

18:16.845 --> 18:17.721
Don't be late.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.599
If you're that worried, use this.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.059
I'll leave your gift here.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.227
Gift?

18:23.560 --> 18:26.355
He's afraid to lose himself again
and hurt someone.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.857
It's a tool to relieve anxiety.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.822
Anzai, who are you?

18:35.823 --> 18:36.740
A vampire?

18:38.534 --> 18:39.785
No, you're a cop.

18:43.413 --> 18:46.291
Come to think of it,
doesn't it bother you?

18:46.625 --> 18:47.793
What should be bothering me?

18:48.752 --> 18:51.880
You were almost killed.
Most people would be scared.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.008
I mean, it was Mr. Anzai...

18:58.470 --> 18:59.555
You like him that much?

18:59.847 --> 19:01.974
Then, why not train him
to have better tolerance?

19:02.307 --> 19:03.142
Train him?

19:03.308 --> 19:06.395
You see, I have a little bit
of human blood every day.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.272
You drink blood?

19:08.605 --> 19:10.858
Is it really okay to do that?

19:11.108 --> 19:14.695
As I said, I only have a little each day
to get a tolerance.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.573
That way, it's easier for me
to resist the urge to feed.

19:18.115 --> 19:21.201
So even if I see or taste blood,
I'll still be in control.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.120
It also heals wounds.

19:24.121 --> 19:27.457
So that's the reason Mr. Anzai
was okay after being shot?

19:28.292 --> 19:30.502
But whose blood is that?

19:30.836 --> 19:33.589
I ask several people
to share a little with me.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.758
That way, it's not too hard
on anyone, you know?

19:37.968 --> 19:39.928
I would have never thought of that.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.390
Do you want me to help you look for Anzai?

19:43.682 --> 19:46.435
There aren't many halves like us,
so I want to talk to him.

19:47.060 --> 19:50.731
Also, I may be able to help him
get a tolerance for blood.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.119
She's smiling and crying.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.290
I've never seen that before.

20:11.084 --> 20:15.005
Mr. Anzai, you can have
a tolerance for blood.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.927
Once you do,
things will be a little easier.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.643
Could we be together again?

20:32.439 --> 20:33.357
I have to say it.

20:34.942 --> 20:35.859
I will say it!

20:37.027 --> 20:38.612
This time, I will be the one

20:39.529 --> 20:40.697
to tell him I like him.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.293
Good evening, everyone.
I'm here at the Fountain Plaza.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.712
It rained on and off today.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.048
Tomorrow, it will snow
for the first time in a while.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.425
Let's have a look
at the whole country's weather.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.804
I'll look for you. I will see you again.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.182
Wait for me, Mr. Anzai.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.988
It has been freezing all day.
We may even have colder weather.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.994
So, have a good night, everyone,
and please stay warm!

21:34.418 --> 21:35.335
A street slasher!

21:35.419 --> 21:36.753
Are we still live?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.797
Hey! What the hell?

23:28.031 --> 23:29.282
Devil's Line.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.700
Line 5.

23:31.409 --> 23:32.494
Plan B.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.871
