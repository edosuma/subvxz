00:03.742 --> 00:04.091
.

00:04.134 --> 00:05.483
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

00:05.527 --> 00:06.832
What are you doing, Barnes?

00:08.095 --> 00:09.357
- I'm about to lose it
on this guy.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.054
- Go do what you got to do.

00:11.098 --> 00:14.884
- I am transferring you
out of 51.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.842
Now I'm a man down.

00:16.886 --> 00:17.930
- I can help with that.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.584
- Yeah.

00:19.628 --> 00:20.672
- Yeah, I'm in.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.848
- Welcome to 51, Ritter.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.111
- This is Tyler.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.287
This is my best friend
from high school.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.289
What is this with you
and Tyler?

00:28.332 --> 00:30.073
You didn't even try
to get to know him.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.727
- He's in love with you.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.424
I'm right about this.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.690
- Oh, wow, you're in a hurry to
get to work.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.997
- Yeah, Herrmann asked me
to get in early.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.086
He's in a panic about
some Molly's thing.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.870
- Herrmann's always in a panic.

00:44.914 --> 00:46.785
Hey, you and Severide weren't
at the bar last night.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.483
What's up?

00:48.526 --> 00:50.528
- We haven't hung out
the last few nights.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.358
- He got weird about
my friend Tyler,

00:54.402 --> 00:57.013
and then I got weird
because I didn't like that,

00:57.057 --> 00:59.320
jealousy being my least
favorite quality in a man.

00:59.363 --> 01:01.626
- Oh, I hear you.
Well, it's just a blip, right?

01:01.670 --> 01:03.759
You guys'll get past all that.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.109
- I think so.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.763
God, I hope so.

01:07.806 --> 01:09.156
- Stella.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.853
- I have known Severide
for a long time now.

01:10.896 --> 01:14.683
I've never seen him act
the way he does with you.

01:14.726 --> 01:18.295
- Never.

01:18.339 --> 01:19.775
- Stella Kidd,

01:19.818 --> 01:21.385
as your landlord and your boss,
I'm warning you.

01:21.429 --> 01:22.908
You better get inside right now

01:22.952 --> 01:25.259
or you're gonna end up homeless
and on the go.

01:28.914 --> 01:31.265
- One of those little airbags,
but they're, like, 200 bucks.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.396
Richie from first shift said

01:32.440 --> 01:34.094
they must have left it
on a call.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.096
- Okay, I'll report it,
but we got to be more careful.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.924
- All right. At least Gorsch
isn't around to hear about it.

01:38.968 --> 01:41.101
Think Grissom'll finally decide
to take the boot of our necks?

01:41.144 --> 01:42.754
- I highly doubt it.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.505
Can I help you find something?

01:54.549 --> 01:57.552
- Just trying to see what
I missed while I was gone.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.206
I had to accompany
the Commissioner

01:59.249 --> 02:01.599
to a first responder's
summit in San Diego last week.

02:01.643 --> 02:05.125
He has concerns about
the situation in 51.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.389
- Well, I'm starting to suspect

02:08.432 --> 02:11.043
that it's a failure
of leadership, Wallace.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.784
I see here that
Lieutenant Herrmann

02:12.828 --> 02:15.047
in his very first shift
running a company

02:15.091 --> 02:18.442
bounced a long-term member
of engine 51.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.444
Why wasn't I consulted
about that?

02:20.488 --> 02:22.446
- Company-level personnel
decisions don't typically

02:22.490 --> 02:26.624
require approval
from the commissioner's office.

02:26.668 --> 02:30.585
- Maybe you should worry less
about what's typically required

02:30.628 --> 02:32.413
and start asking yourself why

02:32.456 --> 02:34.937
Commissioner Grissom's faith
in your firehouse

02:34.980 --> 02:37.418
continues to deteriorate.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.076
- It's worse than I thought.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.601
- Well,
for two months in a row now

02:46.644 --> 02:48.298
profits at Molly's have
been sinking.

02:48.342 --> 02:49.647
- Well,
now that you mention that

02:49.691 --> 02:51.432
it has been a little
quieter lately.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.303
- All right,
I got some theories about

02:53.347 --> 02:54.913
why we're bleeding money.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.177
You get real generous
with the pours

02:57.220 --> 02:59.179
when you think
that I'm not watching.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.310
And you.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.920
You keep telling all
the customers

03:01.964 --> 03:03.487
how great Molly's North is.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.446
- There's no way that's
affecting the bottom line.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.838
It's gotta be something else.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.537
- Well, your Yelp rating
isn't helping.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.322
- Yeah.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.281
I was surfing for
a good date spot last week,

03:14.324 --> 03:15.499
saw Molly's Yelp page.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.372
Man, that first one, ouch.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.679
- Bring the page up now.
- It can't be that bad.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.377
What's not to like about
Molly's?

03:23.420 --> 03:25.205
- "Bottom line this bar should
be torn down."

03:25.248 --> 03:26.641
- Oh, jeeze.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.991
- "From the ho-hum decor
and tired cocktails..."

03:29.034 --> 03:31.211
- There's nothing tired about
my 7&7. I use ginger ale.

03:31.254 --> 03:35.432
- "To the slovenly and often
intoxicated crowd of regulars,"

03:35.476 --> 03:37.260
- There may be a little truth
to that review,

03:37.304 --> 03:38.783
but you should come by
tomorrow night.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.959
- "This place is long past it's
expiration date.

03:41.003 --> 03:44.572
My advice, find another bar.
Any other bar."

03:47.183 --> 03:51.056
- What kind of human being
would write a review like that?

03:51.100 --> 03:53.711
- Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3...

03:53.755 --> 03:55.887
- I've been saying this
for a long time.

03:55.931 --> 03:58.063
No good comes out of
the internet.

another way in.

victim down here.

and the door.

Need to get a line there,
Herrmann.

the fire, chief.

instantly.

Ritter, take this.

Gimme a 6-inch hole right about

Cruz, grab a K12
and a pike pole.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.354

He hasn't violated
any guidelines,

a response to this troll

07:40.416 --> 07:42.766

My bad.

I meant to straighten them up,
but, you know.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.880

What's your name?

08:09.924 --> 08:12.056

- Oh, right,
you're the new guy.

off a minute ago.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.455

for you?

08:23.590 --> 08:26.897
I tell you what's good enough
for me.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.421
A smoke eater I can count on.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.554
We just made a grab of
an injured victim

08:31.598 --> 08:33.251
over at the fire,

08:33.295 --> 08:36.559
and when I gave this kid
a direct order,

08:36.603 --> 08:38.300
he got it done.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.260
So if this victim survives...

08:44.175 --> 08:46.613
it'll be because of him.

write him up for the pants.

I'm sorry about that.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.192
Don't sweat it, Ritter.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.630
This has nothing
to do with you.

09:14.336 --> 09:17.165
I-I don't get it.
I mean...

09:17.208 --> 09:18.862
what is Grissom accomplishing

09:18.906 --> 09:22.257
by sending his toady in to
nitpick everything that we do?

09:22.300 --> 09:23.824
- This isn't about Ritter's
bunker pants.

09:23.867 --> 09:27.349
Grissom installed Gorsch here
at 51 to harass Boden,

09:27.392 --> 09:29.569
provoke him,
try to get him to snap

09:29.612 --> 09:30.961
and do something stupid.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.398
- So Grissom'll have
the grounds to dismiss him.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.618
- Well,
it's a pretty dumb plan.

09:35.662 --> 09:36.793
Boden's a rock.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.230
He'll outlast Gorsch
no problem.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.842
- But the rest of us have
to outlast him too.

09:41.885 --> 09:45.454
You start squaring off against
Gorsch like you did out there,

09:45.497 --> 09:47.543
that puts more pressure on
the chief.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.893
- Casey's right, we're all just
gonna have to suck it up

09:49.937 --> 09:52.156
and take whatever Gorsch
dishes out.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.072
- Captain Casey,
you have a visitor.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.432
- I'm Matt Casey.
Were you looking for me?

10:07.476 --> 10:10.044
- Yes, hi.
My name is Naomi Graham.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.699
I'm a reporter and
I heard your company responded

10:12.742 --> 10:14.657
to the Harris Trailer Park fire
this morning.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.877
- That's right.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.182
- Yeah.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.837
- Do you know--
how did the fire start?

10:20.881 --> 10:24.101
- It was in the kitchen.
Seemed to be a stove fire.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.499
- Captain Casey, innocent
people are being killed

10:30.542 --> 10:33.415
and you might be the only
person who can help me stop it.

10:40.857 --> 10:41.031
.

10:41.075 --> 10:44.252
- I write investigative pieces
on a wide range of topics.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.602
But this one hits
close to home.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.082
Little over a year ago,
there was fire in

10:48.125 --> 10:51.085
a trailer park near
my mom's home in Janesville.

10:51.128 --> 10:54.175
I knew some of the families
who lived there.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.655
One, the Hoyts,

10:55.698 --> 10:58.701
had a 10-year-old
with cerebral palsy.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.530
He didn't make it out of there.
- I'm sorry.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.488
- That one started in
the kitchen too.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.229
Fire department called it
an accident.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.667
I didn't question at the time,
had no reason to,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.146
but, being a reporter,

11:09.190 --> 11:11.714
I read tons of local papers
from across the country,

11:11.758 --> 11:14.108
and I started
to notice something.

11:14.151 --> 11:17.807
Trailer fires, seven of them
over the course of the year,

11:17.851 --> 11:21.506
across Wisconsin, Indiana,
and Illinois.

11:21.550 --> 11:25.685
- Seven doesn't seem like
a lot over such a wide area.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.513
Trailer fires are as common
as any home fire

11:28.557 --> 11:31.168
and the kitchen is the most
likely point of origin.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.170
- Yes, but these all happen

11:33.214 --> 11:35.738
in the same exact make
and model trailer

11:35.782 --> 11:37.958
from a builder called
Grandbrook.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.350
- I've heard the name.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.874
- These fires have been
so destructive

11:40.917 --> 11:43.877
there's not enough evidence
to determine cause,

11:43.920 --> 11:46.009
and because they all start
in the kitchen there hasn't

11:46.053 --> 11:48.664
been reason to suspect
anything more than an accident,

11:48.708 --> 11:49.883
but there's something wrong.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.276
Same exact make,
same type of fire,

11:52.320 --> 11:55.149
and the company refuses to even
have a conversation with me.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.760
Why aren't they concerned?

11:57.804 --> 11:59.806
- I don't know.
There are plenty of reasons

11:59.849 --> 12:02.025
they wouldn't want
to talk to a reporter.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.157
No offense.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.549
- None taken.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.116
I'm proud to be called
a pain in the ass,

12:06.160 --> 12:08.118
and I'm not gonna let this go.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.555
I'd like to take a look inside
the trailer from this morning.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.862
Is that something you can help
me with?

12:15.082 --> 12:17.171
- I'll see what I can do.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.567
- Herrmann's really stressed
about it,

12:22.611 --> 12:23.917
so, you know, the more of us

12:23.960 --> 12:26.267
that we can get to Molly's
the better.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.486
- I'm happy to go.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.010
- Great.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.535
Hey, it feels like we haven't

12:33.578 --> 12:35.493
seen enough of each other
these past couple weeks.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.539
So what do you say
we sneak out early?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.108
- Yeah, sounds good.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.588
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.469
- I'll gonna give you a call
as soon as we get off shift.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.340
- Great. My cell number's
on here,

12:56.384 --> 12:58.125
and thank you, Matt.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.866
- Happy to help.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.524
- She's a journalist.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.744
Had some questions about
the trailer park fire

13:08.788 --> 13:10.267
we responded to this morning.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.966
- So refer her to the public
relations department.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.274
- It's not a PR issue.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.624
It's a public safety concern.
She thinks the--

13:19.668 --> 13:22.497
- Captain, I said send her
to Chief Huffhines.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.716
Let him handle it.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.808
- What's her interest
in that fire?

13:28.851 --> 13:31.245
- Just some theories she's got.

13:32.681 --> 13:33.987
I don't want to cross Gorsch.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.553
I can tell her to go through
Huffhines.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.818
- She's noticed a pattern
of trailer fires,

13:38.861 --> 13:40.732
thinks ours might fit
the profile.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.473
She wants me to show her around
the scene,

13:42.517 --> 13:44.127
but I can back out of it--

13:44.171 --> 13:46.129
- No, you go ahead.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.005
- Maybe.
It's the right the thing to do,

13:52.048 --> 13:53.963
so that's how
we're gonna proceed.

13:55.922 --> 13:59.403
Anyway, he is not the real
problem here.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.231
Grissom is.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.842
And I think it's time

14:02.885 --> 14:05.670
I went to see our commissioner
and try to patch things up.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.891
You know, bend the knee,
kiss the ring.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.591
- You think Grissom will
respond to that?

14:13.635 --> 14:16.029
- Maybe, but...

14:16.072 --> 14:17.857
I'm not sure you can
stomach it.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.206
- Yeah.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.557
Let me worry about that.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.914
- Hey,
the angry Yelper responded.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.568
"Sorry, buddy,
but Molly's is done.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.004
"Little things like snacks
at the bar

14:35.048 --> 14:36.701
"or getting the latest three
Floyd's on tap

14:36.745 --> 14:38.138
"doesn't change that.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.923
You've got to overhaul
the whole kit and caboodle."

14:40.967 --> 14:43.839
He just slammed us again.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.886
- We just got that three
Floyd's on tap the other night.

14:46.929 --> 14:50.106
He's still coming to the bar.
We can sniff him out.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.935
- Yeah, first clue,
kit and caboodle,

14:52.979 --> 14:54.719
so he's no spring chicken.

14:54.763 --> 14:57.374
- If this guy doesn't like
the place

14:57.418 --> 14:58.723
why does he keep coming back?

14:58.767 --> 15:00.595
- He's a hater.
Plain and simple.

15:00.638 --> 15:01.988
It's like those guys
that go see

15:02.031 --> 15:03.946
every superhero movie
and then they shred them.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.688
- Okay, hypothetically
speaking, he comes back.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.909
We figure out who it is.
Then what?

15:09.952 --> 15:13.042
- We kick him out.
- Well, that'll show him.

15:13.086 --> 15:15.218
- Maybe you can convince him
to write a good review.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.393
- Or pay him to.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.395
- I'm not spending a dime.

15:18.439 --> 15:22.182
You love my crummy bar or
you get your ass to the curb.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.101
- That's the right attitude
for a bar.

15:28.144 --> 15:31.452
- Aw, don't listen to him.
It's a really fun place.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.888
- Sounds like I should have

15:32.932 --> 15:34.411
brought my date there
last week.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.935
I might have had
a better ending.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.154
- I got dumped.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.983
Ghosted, actually.
Can't even get a call back.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.376
- I hate it when people
don't have

15:42.419 --> 15:44.204
the common decency
to make a phone call.

15:44.247 --> 15:47.424
- Me too.
The night ended up okay though.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.383
Called the hottest hook-up
on my contacts

15:49.426 --> 15:51.951
and we went to every
whiskey bar in Chicago.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.050
- Battalion Chief
Wallace Boden.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.921
I was hoping to get a moment
with Commissioner Grissom.

16:05.965 --> 16:10.230
The earliest I can fit you
in...

16:10.273 --> 16:12.232
looks like...

16:12.275 --> 16:13.798
week after Thanksgiving.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.670
- I don't really need much of
his time.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.541
I thought I could just wait,

16:17.585 --> 16:19.543
you know,
till he has a second.

16:19.587 --> 16:22.111
- He's in back to back meetings
this afternoon.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.808
I can let him know you're
here--

16:23.852 --> 16:25.201
- Thank you.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.029
I'll just...

16:27.073 --> 16:28.683
Thank you.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.741
- It's probably why
I do what I do.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.570
Growing up an army brat
you get that wanderlust.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.181
I love the constant travel.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.878
- Where's this piece gonna be
published?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.314
Nowhere,

16:51.358 --> 16:54.143
unless I can come up
with some hard evidence.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.579
It's a tough one.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.581
Authorities haven't been able
to find any wrong-doing

16:57.625 --> 16:59.061
and I haven't been able
to examine

16:59.105 --> 17:01.063
any of the fire scenes myself.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.674
It's why I've been so eager
to get a look at this one.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.372
Plus, it involves
another fatality

17:05.415 --> 17:07.374
so the stakes are pretty high.

17:09.985 --> 17:13.032
- Yeah,
the woman you pulled out.

17:14.207 --> 17:16.861
I'm sorry.
I assumed you already knew.

17:16.905 --> 17:20.735
- We don't always hear what
happens after our part is done.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.999
- Must be hard to get bad news
like that.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.176
- Trailer's right here.

17:40.581 --> 17:40.798
.

17:40.842 --> 17:43.540
- Nobody told me about any
Office of Fire Investigation

17:43.584 --> 17:45.020
or that I needed to keep
the trailer on site.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.501
- At the time, we had no reason
to be suspicious

17:47.544 --> 17:49.677
of the fire's origins,
but now we do.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.853
So we need to find out where
that trailer went.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.159
- This is all I got.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.682
It shows they got a lien
on the trailer,

17:54.725 --> 17:56.292
so why would I keep them
from hauling it away?

17:56.336 --> 17:57.902
The thing was destroyed.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.600
- GBR Holdings, LLC.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.472
I'll bet you 100 bucks that's
a Grandbrook subsidiary.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.431
a shell company so they can
hide their tracks.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.173
- Without the trailer,

18:07.216 --> 18:08.739
OFI can't rule out
a stove fire.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.612
- Why would a stove fire cause
an explosion?

18:13.614 --> 18:15.746
- Yeah, a bunch of us did.

18:15.790 --> 18:20.534
It was like a loud pop and then
the thing went up like a torch.

18:20.577 --> 18:23.754
- I don't know.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.061
Are there any other trailers
of that type around here?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.410
What's the model number?

18:27.454 --> 18:29.020
- The Grandbrook S11
single-wide.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.806
- Sure, we got a bunch of 'em.
There's one right there.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.552
- I'm gonna take a look inside.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.597
See if I can reverse engineer
what happened.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.338
Thanks.
- Sure.

18:42.382 --> 18:43.905
- In my experience,
people don't like it

18:43.948 --> 18:46.255
when journalists
just show up at their door.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.653
- Sir, my name's Matt Casey,

18:52.696 --> 18:55.177
I'm one of the firefighters who
responded to the fire

18:55.221 --> 18:56.613
at your neighbor's
home yesterday.

18:56.657 --> 18:57.832
- Oh, yeah.

18:57.875 --> 19:01.052
Poor Cathy, and I heard what
happened to her.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.445
It's just awful.

19:02.489 --> 19:05.100
- We're trying to figure out
how the fire started.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.667
Do you mind if we come inside?

19:06.710 --> 19:07.624
- Oh.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.758
Course not, no.
Please.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.803
- Should bring you
with me more often.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.114
- This is gas absorption
refrigerator.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.770
- It uses heat to drive
the cooling process.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.947
They're pretty common
in trailers, boats, RVs.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.862
You know if Cathy had
the same fridge?

19:27.905 --> 19:30.647
- I assume so.
It comes built in.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.129
- She had the same kitchen
layout, right?

19:34.173 --> 19:35.565
Up next to the fridge.

19:35.609 --> 19:38.002
- Yeah, they'll all pretty
much identical.

19:40.570 --> 19:41.963
- I want try an experiment,

19:42.006 --> 19:46.620
but I'd need this exact model
of refrigerator.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.362
- Terry, how much do you want
for your fridge?

20:04.681 --> 20:06.466
- Ma'am.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.250
Is commissioner gonna see me
or not?

20:08.294 --> 20:10.165
- I'm sorry,
he left a few minutes ago.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.645
Dinner with the mayor.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.953
He left out a back way.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.654
- Oh, I can see how this is
gonna work.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.264
- Would you like to make
an appointment?

20:22.308 --> 20:24.527
- No...
thanks.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.278
- Your mission,
should you choose--

20:36.322 --> 20:37.671
- Find out who the Yelper is.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.238
We're looking for
a possible regular,

20:39.281 --> 20:41.675
50 years old or up.
We know.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.590
- I'm not sure I'm gonna be
very good at this.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.897
- If we find him,
do we win a free beer?

20:48.377 --> 20:50.597
- You win Molly's not
shutting down

20:50.640 --> 20:53.382
is what you win.
Now, go.

20:56.385 --> 21:00.215
- You know, it's a miracle you
have any friends at all.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.349
- I might be a little on edge.

21:03.392 --> 21:07.091
Things are going south at 51,
this place is falling apart.

21:07.135 --> 21:10.921
I sunk a lot into Molly's,
and I'm not just talking money.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.490
I don't want to lose
this place.

21:17.406 --> 21:20.191
- Just don't scare
our customers, okay?

21:20.235 --> 21:21.889
Okay. All right.

21:21.932 --> 21:23.151
- All right.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.722
- I seen you here a lot.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.637
- I come by when I can.
Why?

21:32.116 --> 21:34.989
- Sure. Found my carpet
cleaners that way.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.557
- Hey, I need
a good carpet cleaner.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.733
This girl that I'm seeing,
Chloe,

21:39.776 --> 21:41.996
she's got this dog,
just destroys rugs.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.694
His name's Rizzo.
Funny thing, I assumed that

21:44.738 --> 21:46.827
he was named after
the Cubs player.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.351
Turns out he's actually named
after the character in Greece.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.397
That's 'cause Chloe's
into musicals.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.007
She's very, very creative.

21:53.050 --> 21:56.706
- Wow, great table.
Perfect view of the TV.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.360
You come here often?

21:58.404 --> 22:01.102
- Once in a while.
How about you?

22:03.365 --> 22:05.585
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

22:05.628 --> 22:09.589
Was just wondering
if you guys are into Yelp.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.939
- What is that supposed
to mean?

22:11.982 --> 22:15.464
- Never mind, I'm really
looking for someone older.

22:17.901 --> 22:22.558
- Severide, did you write that
lousy review of Molly's online?

22:22.602 --> 22:25.431
- Course not.
- My job here is done.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.823
You're out?

22:26.867 --> 22:28.695
- Yep, time to join Ritter
at the bar.

22:28.738 --> 22:31.524
- Oh, he came, that's so great.
I wish Foster would.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.047
I think she can really
use a night out.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.875
- I invited Ritter.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.530
- Oh, well, I didn't
specifically ask Foster.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.097
I'm sure she knows I would be
glad to see her,

22:40.141 --> 22:41.838
or maybe she doesn't.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.892
- Hey, chief.
- Hey.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.851
You okay?

22:54.895 --> 22:57.767
- I'll feel better when I've
had a drink.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.683
Thanks.

23:03.773 --> 23:06.036
- Gorsch isn't going anywhere.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.867
He's dug in
and he's coming for us.

23:22.270 --> 23:25.882
You moving into a college dorm?

23:25.926 --> 23:27.536
- Hope you don't mind.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.408
Dropped your name over
at the academy.

23:29.451 --> 23:33.281
Let me use the training area
to run a few tests.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.419
- Boden never got to talk
to Grissom.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.159
Couldn't get past the lobby.

23:50.516 --> 23:53.475
- Wallace,
I just learned that Casey

23:53.519 --> 23:55.216
is working with that reporter
after all,

23:55.259 --> 23:58.349
despite my direct order
to stand down.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.395
- Deputy Gorsch, would you mind
closing the door?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.397
- You know how I feel about
closed doors.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.400
Fine.

24:05.444 --> 24:09.143
Then I will say this for
the whole world to hear.

24:09.186 --> 24:14.931
Jerry, Assistant Deputy
Commissioner Gorsch,

24:14.975 --> 24:17.673
if Grissom wants you to park it
here in my firehouse

24:17.717 --> 24:19.109
just waiting to catch us
in a mistake,

24:19.153 --> 24:21.068
I can't do anything about that.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.679
But this is still my firehouse.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.899
These people answer to me.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.596
You start telling people
what to do

24:27.640 --> 24:29.772
you disrupt
the chain of command

24:29.816 --> 24:31.948
opening the door
to chaos and confusion

24:31.992 --> 24:35.648
in a job where there are lives
on the line...

24:37.998 --> 24:40.261
And I will not let that happen.

24:43.482 --> 24:48.051
- You know, Wallace, things
don't need to be so difficult.

24:48.095 --> 24:51.751
There's a very simple way for
you to get out of this mess.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.625
- Relinquish your command
of 51.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.888
Step down and take
an administrative post.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.456
You'll keep your rank,
your salary, you pension--

25:02.936 --> 25:04.807
Ride a desk all the way
to my retirement?

25:04.851 --> 25:06.548
- You'll be performing
important work with

25:06.592 --> 25:09.943
the new CFD Efficiency Task
Force, which I am overseeing.

25:09.986 --> 25:12.162
You will report directly to me.

25:15.862 --> 25:20.127
- You have no cause
to strip me of my command.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.651
- I'm making you an offer.
If you don't take it,

25:22.695 --> 25:24.610
I'll just keeping looking
over your shoulder

25:24.653 --> 25:26.568
until you give me cause.

25:26.612 --> 25:30.659
You remember what you wrote in
my review all those years ago?

25:30.703 --> 25:33.140
I do.
Every word.

25:33.183 --> 25:36.012
"Candidate Gorsch shows a keen
interest in the fire service,

25:36.056 --> 25:39.320
but I'm afraid his talents
lie elsewhere."

25:39.363 --> 25:42.758
You were right, Wallace,
I wasn't much of a firefighter,

25:42.802 --> 25:44.978
but turns out I'm very good

25:45.021 --> 25:47.807
at giving the Commissioner
what he wants.

25:57.468 --> 25:57.599
.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.254
- Guys, Boden is tearing Gorsch
a new one.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.038
It is ugly in there.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.040
- All started out with
that reporter,

26:04.084 --> 26:05.738
the one you were supposed
to take to the PR office,

26:05.781 --> 26:07.696
and then they just started
yelling at each other.

26:07.740 --> 26:10.656
Threats are flying.
It's crazy in there.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.266
- This is on me.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.573
I should have done a better job
at keeping it under the radar.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.618
- Boden gave you the go ahead.
He's the chief.

26:16.662 --> 26:19.273
- For now.

26:19.316 --> 26:21.231
- Maybe if I talk to Gorsch
about it?

26:21.275 --> 26:23.451
- You saw what happened when
I tried that.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.368
- We need to get to Grissom.

26:27.411 --> 26:28.761
- Well, didn't Boden try
that already?

26:28.804 --> 26:31.154
- Boden not close with
the commissioner...

26:32.286 --> 26:34.418
but Benny is.

26:34.462 --> 26:35.898
- You wanna ask your dad
for help?

26:35.942 --> 26:37.421
- He's the one person

26:37.465 --> 26:38.814
who might be able
to get through to Grissom.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.642
- I thought things weren't too
good with you guys.

26:40.686 --> 26:44.211
- They're not,
but it's nothing new.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.866
- Are you sure
that's a good idea?

26:50.434 --> 26:54.613
- Ambulance 61, injured
person, O'Hare Airport.

26:57.224 --> 26:58.704
- They're in the TSA office.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.488
- Well, what's going on,
do you know?

27:00.531 --> 27:02.316
- Not really. I mean,
I saw something on her,

27:02.359 --> 27:03.752
but I'm not sure
what I saw was right,

27:03.796 --> 27:05.449
if you know what I mean.
- I don't think I do.

27:05.493 --> 27:06.799
- She was on her way back
from Russia.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.104
I mean,
guess it started on the plane,

27:08.148 --> 27:09.453
and customs stopped her

27:09.497 --> 27:11.630
because you can't bring
that here.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.458
- Careful there.

27:14.502 --> 27:17.505
- Are you hurt ma'am.
- It's right here, please.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.028
- Did you get knocked
in the face?

27:19.072 --> 27:20.377
- Mm-mm.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.293
- Whoa.

27:23.337 --> 27:25.687
- Okay, so it's moving.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.297
- When did this start
happening, ma'am?

27:27.341 --> 27:29.473
- It was swollen yesterday.
I thought it was

27:29.517 --> 27:31.693
an allergic reaction from
my mosquito bites,

27:31.737 --> 27:34.304
but once we got in the air
it started moving.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.784
- She's coming from
St. Petersburg.

27:35.828 --> 27:37.612
Said she spent some time in
a cabin outside the city.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.266
- It used to be down here.

27:39.309 --> 27:40.397
- So it's migrating
to your nose?

27:40.441 --> 27:41.703
- I guess so.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.183
- Okay, we need to get you
to the hospital.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.575
- That's a living creature
in there.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.490
She needs to be quarantined.
She can't leave.

27:46.534 --> 27:47.840
- We need to get her
to an operating room

27:47.883 --> 27:50.146
so surgeons can remove
and isolate it.

27:50.190 --> 27:54.237
It's moving again, please!

27:56.326 --> 27:57.719
- All right, ice may be able
to immobilize it.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.503
Least give us enough time
to get to the hospital.

27:59.547 --> 28:00.809
- We've got to go now.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.463
- Okay. Okay,
but I'm coming with you.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.204
I need to make sure that things
properly disposed of.

28:04.247 --> 28:05.684
- We'll get you to the hospital

28:05.727 --> 28:07.163
and the doctor's will remove
it right away.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.295
Okay?
- Okay.

28:08.338 --> 28:09.688
- I'll help you up.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.826
- So what's the deal with
Severide and his dad?

28:17.870 --> 28:19.828
- Benny's a retired
CFD Battalion Chief.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.395
Larger than life.

28:21.438 --> 28:24.180
Him and Severide is
one complicated relationship.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.268
- I hear that.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.358
- They got the parasite out,
destroyed it.

28:28.402 --> 28:29.751
She's doing fine.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.362
The thing was a lot longer
than I expected.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.540
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.325
What's wrong?

28:38.368 --> 28:41.763
- The--the date that didn't
call back.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.809
- Well, you're not the one who
should hide.

28:43.852 --> 28:46.637
Hey, excuse me.
You know, it is not that hard

28:46.681 --> 28:48.422
to man up and make
a phone call.

28:48.465 --> 28:50.163
That is the respectful thing
to do

28:50.206 --> 28:52.861
and you know what else?
She is way too good for you.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.298
- I'm not sure I--

28:56.038 --> 28:58.954
do we know each other?
- No, we don't.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.652
He's not the date.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.306
She is.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.618
- Oh.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.319
Whoops.

29:21.629 --> 29:24.632
- It's the thought that counts.
Thank you.

29:33.946 --> 29:36.035
- Chief.

29:36.078 --> 29:40.387
Heard you had a little dust up.
Everything okay?

29:41.954 --> 29:43.477
- I don't know.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.437
Gorsch is set on ruining me

29:47.481 --> 29:49.178
with Grissom's blessing.

29:49.222 --> 29:51.920
My only options are fight
him with all that I got

29:51.964 --> 29:54.967
making our lives a whole lot
harder, or...

29:57.273 --> 29:59.493
I just let him win.

30:05.455 --> 30:08.110
- It's like you said, chief.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.330
If it's the right thing to do,

30:10.373 --> 30:12.201
that's how we proceed.

30:13.159 --> 30:16.466
Can't see how letting them win
is the right thing.

30:23.212 --> 30:24.692
- Yeah.

30:41.187 --> 30:42.971
- This thing with your dad.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.104
- I'm gonna stop by his place,
try and talk to him.

30:45.147 --> 30:48.455
- I get why you want to do
this, but I care about you

30:48.498 --> 30:50.413
so I just have to point out

30:50.457 --> 30:52.589
that things don't
normally go well

30:52.633 --> 30:54.809
when you ask him for things.
- I know that.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.245
- You come away from it
in pain.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.594
- I used to.

30:57.638 --> 30:58.813
- Well, you think it's
different now?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.380
You haven't talked to him since

31:00.423 --> 31:03.513
that fight that you had
months ago.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.037
- I guess we'll see.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.868
- Hey.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.047
I love you.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.093
You know that?

31:23.403 --> 31:24.970
- I love you too.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.163
- Yeah.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.036
So talk me through this.
What are we doing?

31:48.080 --> 31:50.778
- We are trying to recreate
the conditions

31:50.821 --> 31:53.172
inside the kitchen
of a Grandbrook trailer.

31:53.215 --> 31:56.044
See if we can get this
refrigerator to fail.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.134
- A gas absorption fridge

31:59.178 --> 32:00.788
runs on hydrogen and ammonia,

32:00.831 --> 32:02.311
but this third-rate appliance

32:02.355 --> 32:04.444
has no heat shielding
around the tank.

32:04.487 --> 32:05.967
And then the geniuses
at Grandbrook

32:06.011 --> 32:07.577
install it right next
to a stove.

32:07.621 --> 32:10.841
If the tank heats up enough
it gets overpressured,

32:10.885 --> 32:12.669
which triggers
the blowoff valve,

32:12.713 --> 32:15.411
releasing a volatile mixture
of fuel and oxidizer

32:15.455 --> 32:17.196
right next to the hot stove.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.067
Kablooey.

32:19.111 --> 32:22.244
I never would have
figured that out on my own.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.725
I don't know how to thank you
for all you're doing.

32:31.645 --> 32:32.907
You were right.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.741
- Now you have your proof.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.119
- Need to talk to you.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.125
- Then you better come in.

33:25.046 --> 33:25.177
.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.048
- Last time I saw you

33:27.092 --> 33:28.354
you were calling me
a scared old man.

33:28.397 --> 33:30.965
Then you ignored me
for six months.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.969
Now you want my help.
- That's right.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.450
- Nerves of steel.
- Runs in the blood.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.062
Well, I know all about

33:41.106 --> 33:43.282
the friction between Boden
and Commissioner Grissom.

33:43.325 --> 33:45.110
- So you needs he trying
to beat Boden down,

33:45.153 --> 33:46.459
strip him of his command.

33:46.502 --> 33:48.026
- Well...

33:48.069 --> 33:50.985
your holier-than-thou chief
brought this on himself.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.466
Tried to undercut
the rising commissioner.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.076
What'd he think was
gonna happen?

33:55.120 --> 33:57.383
A handshake and a promotion?

34:01.343 --> 34:02.910
- Look...

34:05.478 --> 34:07.175
I don't ask you for much.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.874
Kay, Dad, I'm asking you
to help Boden.

34:12.354 --> 34:15.444
- Because Boden's the only
reason I'm still around.

34:15.488 --> 34:17.098
He's the only one who always
had my back.

34:17.142 --> 34:19.361
- I had your back too, Kelly.

34:19.405 --> 34:20.884
Might not have been ways you
always wanted,

34:20.928 --> 34:22.190
but I've been here.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.672
'Cause from my end you were
MIA plenty.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.195
Especially when things
got tough.

34:27.239 --> 34:30.285
Boden was the only one who
picked me back up.

34:30.329 --> 34:33.027
- That's right.

34:36.074 --> 34:43.298

34:44.212 --> 34:47.607
Look, Pop, I didn't come
here to fight.

34:49.435 --> 34:52.220
I just came to ask for
your help. That's all.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.966
- I don't know
there's much I can do.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.534
I think that

35:01.577 --> 35:05.451
the threshold might have been
crossed on this one...

35:05.494 --> 35:06.930
but...

35:09.019 --> 35:10.934
I'll think it over.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.073

♪

35:54.630 --> 35:56.806
- In Captain Casey's estimation
it's surprising

more of Grandbrook's trailers
haven't burned down.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.421
"They need to stop using

You are a great interview,
Matt.

You'd be surprised
how rare that is.

- That's the idea.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.491
I just hope your involvement

36:29.535 --> 36:31.232
doesn't cause trouble
for your chief.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.016
- The story'll save lives.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.105
That's what he cares about.

36:39.327 --> 36:40.676
- Ah!

36:40.720 --> 36:43.201
The New York Times Magazine is
interested.

36:43.244 --> 36:45.333
- Congratulations.

36:48.380 --> 36:51.034
So what now?

36:52.384 --> 36:53.820
- I just have to proof
the draft

36:53.863 --> 36:56.344
and get it to them
by tomorrow.

36:56.388 --> 36:59.608
Guess I'm done monopolizing
your time.

36:59.652 --> 37:01.393
- Okay.

37:02.959 --> 37:05.005
Well...

37:05.048 --> 37:06.354
yeah.

37:11.577 --> 37:14.057
Let me know if you need
anything else.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.725
- Otis, I'll take another
Seven&Seven.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.553
- You got it Jake.

37:31.597 --> 37:33.207
- Hey, man--

37:33.251 --> 37:34.774
- Don't you know how to order
from a bar?

37:34.817 --> 37:36.297
- I'm sorry, man.
- You find an empty space.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.385
You don't go banging
into people.

37:37.429 --> 37:38.734
- I'll get you more peanuts.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.301
- Wasn't just the peanuts.
It was the drink,

37:40.345 --> 37:42.303
it was the water,
the whole kit and caboodle.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.874
- What are you looking
at me for?

37:48.701 --> 37:51.051
- How could you one star us,
Jake?

37:51.094 --> 37:52.487
Why?

37:52.531 --> 37:54.533
- Maybe we should go online

37:54.576 --> 37:57.405
and one star
your auto parts store, huh?

37:57.449 --> 37:59.189
- It was getting too crowded
in here.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.670
My regular seat at the bar
is always taken.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.542
- You got to take down
that review, Jake.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.761
- Then it'll just get
crowded again.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.939
- I'll tell you what.

38:10.810 --> 38:13.726
You change that review,
and we'll make sure

38:13.769 --> 38:16.990
that your seat
is here whenever you are.

38:20.863 --> 38:23.518
Wow, hell yeah, it's a deal.

38:23.562 --> 38:25.433
- Yay.

38:25.477 --> 38:30.090
- Okay. One Seven&Seven
coming right up.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.266
- You handled that very well.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.356
- The guy's loves the place.
I can appreciate that.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.011
Real short pours for
this guy from now on.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.752
- Oh, yeah.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.755
- That was really cool of you
having my back at the hospital.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.757
- Sorry about the gender
mix-up thing.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.237
I swear I heard you mention
boyfriends.

38:47.281 --> 38:50.284
- I've had boyfriends
and girlfriends.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.069
There's no point in limiting
yourself, right?

38:53.113 --> 38:55.681
- You are full of surprises,
you know that.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.857
- Hey, you are too.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.468
It's gonna be fun getting
to know each other.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.216
- Have a good night, Chief.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.187
- The answer's no.

39:25.145 --> 39:27.321
I will not accept your offer.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.627
I have no interest

39:28.670 --> 39:31.020
in working for you
or your sham task force.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.326
I am going to stay right here

39:32.370 --> 39:35.677
with my people doing work
that matters,

39:35.721 --> 39:38.463
and if that means that you are
coming for me, Gorsch...

39:40.726 --> 39:41.857
Bring it.

39:43.946 --> 39:46.732
I have faced tougher
adversaries than you...

39:47.863 --> 39:51.171
and there wasn't one
could go the distance.

39:51.214 --> 39:52.477
So...

39:58.787 --> 40:00.615
Let's see what you got.
