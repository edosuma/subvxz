00:08.426 --> 00:09.427
Stop!

00:18.144 --> 00:19.521
I said stop!

01:36.556 --> 01:37.557
Stop him.

01:53.907 --> 01:55.950
Yeah!

01:56.034 --> 01:57.035
- Hell yeah!
- Smoked him!

01:59.120 --> 02:00.497
What can't guns do?

02:03.541 --> 02:05.460
Another problem solved by guns.

02:05.877 --> 02:07.545
- All right!
- Yeah.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.671
Look!

02:29.067 --> 02:30.235
Run!

02:38.910 --> 02:39.911
No!

02:40.203 --> 02:41.246
Run!

02:46.459 --> 02:47.669
Jess, we gotta go.

02:47.752 --> 02:48.837
Son of a bitch, he's killing them all!

02:48.920 --> 02:52.799
Wait, no, no, no!
He'll kill us too if we don't go now.

02:52.924 --> 02:54.467
Where's Tulip?

02:58.847 --> 03:00.557
You hear that? We gotta go!

03:01.933 --> 03:02.851
Look.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.352
<i>The death toll continues to climb</i>

03:04.435 --> 03:06.312
<i>at a small West Texas town</i>

03:06.396 --> 03:09.732
<i>where a large methane
leak caused a devastation explosion.</i>

03:09.816 --> 03:12.902
<i>Grim new details are emerging
as local authorities are reporting</i>

03:12.986 --> 03:15.572
<i>that survivors are highly unlikely.</i>

03:15.655 --> 03:16.865
<i>Authorities are compiling...</i>

03:16.948 --> 03:20.451
We gotta go! We gotta go!
What? What? What is it?

03:21.119 --> 03:22.745
Look.

03:25.623 --> 03:26.916
Let's go.

03:46.853 --> 03:48.062
No! Don't shoot!

03:48.313 --> 03:51.524
Jesse. Now would be
a really good time for Genesis.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.818
I tried. It doesn't work.

03:54.319 --> 03:56.487
The window is painted shut.

03:56.571 --> 03:59.198
Climb up on me shoulders
and see if you can pry it open.

04:06.164 --> 04:07.165
Please, don't!

04:23.014 --> 04:25.266
Hey, wait a minute. I pressed "root beer."

04:28.853 --> 04:29.896
Have any quarters?

04:29.979 --> 04:32.190
Shh! Shut up. Mass murderer.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.026
I pressed "root beer,"
not "ginger ale." It's not fair!

04:35.109 --> 04:37.028
What's wrong with ginger ale?

04:37.111 --> 04:38.571
It's good for blood loss, do you know that?

04:40.531 --> 04:42.533
- I want root beer!
- Hey! Shh!

04:45.703 --> 04:46.704
Be quiet.

04:50.708 --> 04:51.751
I want root beer.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.853
Do you have any quarters?

05:43.094 --> 05:44.429
All right.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.432
Three possible explanations
here for all of this.

05:47.557 --> 05:49.851
Number one, <i>Terminator.</i>

05:50.226 --> 05:53.229
Machine sent from the future
to kill one of us.

05:53.312 --> 05:56.065
Number two, <i>Terminator 2.</i>

05:56.149 --> 05:58.192
Machine sent from the future
to kill all three of us.

05:58.276 --> 06:01.446
Or number three, he's Nazgul. Fell Rider.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.655
<i>Lord of the Rings</i>. Brilliant film.

06:02.739 --> 06:03.781
Come on, Cass.

06:03.865 --> 06:05.616
Well, what do you think? Who the hell is he?

06:05.700 --> 06:07.243
How does he keep finding us like that?

06:07.326 --> 06:08.327
I don't know.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.163
Well, what about Mike?

06:10.246 --> 06:12.498
Still not answering the phone.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.428
I'm sorry about your town, Padre.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.682
Do you think that guy back
there had something to do with it?

06:29.766 --> 06:31.476
I don't know, Cass.

06:31.768 --> 06:33.811
It's another thing God's gonna
need to explain.

06:33.895 --> 06:36.773
But we're never gonna find him
with that damn cowboy on our asses.

06:36.898 --> 06:39.025
And I don't know how to stop him.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.905
<i>The Amazing Ganesh.</i>

06:43.988 --> 06:48.159
<i>A performance to remember from
a performer you will never forget.</i>

06:48.242 --> 06:52.747
Hey. I almost forgot to tell you.
I was watching TV last night.

06:52.830 --> 06:55.041
You will never guess
who come on this commercial.

06:55.124 --> 06:57.001
Someone who actually
might be able to help us here.

06:57.085 --> 06:58.169
Someone who actually might know

06:58.252 --> 06:59.337
what to do with this bloody cowboy.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.255
If you say Gandalf, I'm gonna hit you.

07:01.339 --> 07:05.259
No, I mean, really be able to help us out here.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.472
<i>That's life</i>

07:51.556 --> 07:53.891
<i>That's life</i>

07:54.058 --> 07:56.519

07:57.687 --> 08:00.606

<i>Don't let it get me down</i>

09:00.750 --> 09:07.298
<i>I just pick myself up

10:38.889 --> 10:42.852

10:44.854 --> 10:49.900

11:07.084 --> 11:09.754
<i>Laying flat out on my face</i>

11:52.338 --> 11:56.926
<i>Bye-bye</i>

12:07.144 --> 12:09.271
Aw. Someone's been
bloody busy, haven't they?

12:09.355 --> 12:11.148
He's doing really well.

12:11.315 --> 12:13.818
Fiore and his partner
are the angels that came to Annville.

12:13.943 --> 12:15.611
They're the ones
that first told me about Genesis.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.906
No, I thought
this one was Deblanc.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.282
No, that's Fiore.

12:20.366 --> 12:21.867
Oh, maybe you're right. I have no idea.

12:21.951 --> 12:23.077
Where you going?

12:23.160 --> 12:25.663
Drink. You guys got this.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.458
She all right?

12:30.960 --> 12:32.211
Let's go.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.671
Listen. These angels?

12:33.754 --> 12:36.048
How did we leave things with them?

12:36.173 --> 12:37.341
Uh...

12:37.716 --> 12:39.718
You know, good.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.349
You're still mad.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.227
I tried to give it back, I really did. Remember?

12:49.437 --> 12:51.605
Genesis wouldn't leave.
It wanted to stay with me, so...

12:51.689 --> 12:54.692
Excuse me, um, I'm sorry.
Um, Mr. Ganesh...

12:55.526 --> 12:57.027
Come on. Again?

12:59.613 --> 13:01.532
- Go on. Just get it over with.
- Okay.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.992
Sorry.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.703
Jesus. Fucking endless.

13:07.371 --> 13:12.126
Anyway. You and your friend.
Where is he, by the way?

13:12.209 --> 13:13.335
Dead.

13:13.419 --> 13:14.628
No, I thought angels couldn't die.

13:14.712 --> 13:15.713
He's dead.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.047
All right.

13:18.007 --> 13:19.383
Anyway, you guys were right.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.427
You said word would get out about Genesis,

13:21.510 --> 13:23.137
and the bad men would want
it for themselves.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.055
Well, that's happened. Someone's after us.

13:25.139 --> 13:27.099
- The cowboy.
- We don't know how to get rid of him.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.101
We thought maybe
you could help us, Deblanc.

13:30.728 --> 13:32.062
Tell us what you know.

13:34.523 --> 13:39.653
The cowboy isn't a man at all. Not anymore.

13:39.737 --> 13:42.573
His name's the Saint Of Killers.

13:44.909 --> 13:47.036
I thought that was a ghost story.

13:47.119 --> 13:50.706
He's real. He's a beast straight out of hell.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.459
But he doesn't want Genesis for himself,

13:53.542 --> 13:55.920
he wants to kill it, and you.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.839
And there's nothing
anyone can do to stop him.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.551
Except me, 'cause I'm the one that hired him.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.305
There. That's what I know.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.890
Hey!

14:07.973 --> 14:09.767
Hey! There he is!

14:09.850 --> 14:10.935
Hi, Ganesh!

14:12.436 --> 14:13.938
This is for you.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.233
Take a pic.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.195
How do you do it, Ganesh?

14:21.278 --> 14:23.822
How do you die, then come back to life?

14:23.906 --> 14:28.452
Give away my secret?
Nice try, kid. Nice try. Okay.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.458
Two minutes till show time.

14:34.542 --> 14:36.043
Anyway.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.628
You hired this Saint?

14:38.003 --> 14:39.755
Genesis is too dangerous.

14:39.838 --> 14:41.382
Once we saw it wouldn't go back with us,

14:41.465 --> 14:42.716
we told him it had to be destroyed.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.927
In exchange for what?

14:45.052 --> 14:47.638
What are you offering in return?

14:49.390 --> 14:51.850
I could make you un-hire him.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.938
Go on then. Make me. Use it.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.606
Watch what happens.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.402
That's how he's finding us, isn't it?

15:02.194 --> 15:03.696
He's tracking the Word.

15:04.989 --> 15:06.198
That's right.

15:08.659 --> 15:09.785
We called Heaven, you know.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.246
Right. On our phone, which you stole.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.790
And it's a good thing I did,
'cause you know what we found out?

15:14.873 --> 15:16.667
God's gone missing.

15:18.002 --> 15:19.336
He's gone.

15:19.670 --> 15:21.422
Gone? Gone where?

15:22.923 --> 15:24.508
You don't know?

15:25.509 --> 15:26.594
No.

15:28.012 --> 15:29.388
Right.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.976
No one seems to.

15:37.146 --> 15:39.773
I understand why you did what you did,

15:40.858 --> 15:42.860
but things have changed.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.195
We're on the same side now.

15:46.405 --> 15:50.367
If this Saint isn't stopped,
if Genesis is destroyed,

15:51.035 --> 15:53.704
chances are, we're never gonna find God.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.000
I understand.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.753
This is serious.

16:04.715 --> 16:07.176
I don't know what happened to me.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.511
I used to be happy.

16:11.889 --> 16:14.558
Till I come to this place, this earth,

16:15.392 --> 16:17.227
all I knew was peace.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.063
But now?

16:21.690 --> 16:24.485
And this is my only hesitation
at helping you, Preacher,

16:24.568 --> 16:27.988
my only hesitation whatsoever and that is,

16:29.239 --> 16:30.949
I really don't

16:32.534 --> 16:34.286
give a shit.

16:35.871 --> 16:39.166
If you'll excuse me. Frank, hat.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.752
Ah, yes, sir. Coming, sir.

16:43.754 --> 16:44.922
Get off.

16:54.723 --> 16:55.849
Oh, uh...

16:55.933 --> 16:58.227
By the way, I'm Fiore.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.396
Deblanc was the other one.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.818
What now?

17:05.901 --> 17:07.861
Now I'm gonna walk out there
and kick the shit out of him.

17:07.945 --> 17:11.907
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
All right. Calm down. I mean, after that.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.283
Use the Word.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.494
Bring the Saint here.
Then make the angel call him off.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.663
If he can, if he can
even get close enough to him.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.124
After the Saint shoots up
half the bloody casino.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.210
- It's very good. Surgical. I like it.
- What do you suggest?

17:23.293 --> 17:26.338
Well, me and Fiore have a bit of history,

17:26.422 --> 17:28.132
so let me have a crack at him.

17:29.133 --> 17:31.009
- I don't know, Cass...
- No, no, no. Look, I know.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.095
I know I screwed up. All right?

17:33.178 --> 17:35.264
But you gotta let me make it up.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.474
I have a skill set, too, all right. I can help.

17:37.558 --> 17:38.684
And if my way doesn't work,

17:38.767 --> 17:40.853
then we go with
your bloodbath version, how's that?

17:41.854 --> 17:43.981
How long is this "crack" gonna take?

17:44.398 --> 17:46.483
Two hours, forty-five minutes.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.824
What are you gonna do?

17:54.908 --> 17:57.244
Like I said. I have a skill set.

18:08.589 --> 18:09.882
You okay?

18:13.343 --> 18:15.721
I know Walter wasn't much,

18:18.849 --> 18:20.976
but he was my only family left.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.228
I know.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.901
Remember when he came to my "Bring Daddy

18:28.984 --> 18:30.903
- "To First Grade Day?"
- Mmm-hmm.

18:31.069 --> 18:34.823
Showed up so drunk
he kept fallin' off the little kids' desk.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.909
Then he threw up by the swing sets.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.370
And I wasn't that mad, you know?

18:40.871 --> 18:44.208
He was always throwing up
and falling off of things.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.213
I wasn't that mad 'cause

18:50.714 --> 18:52.716
he wore a suit and tie.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.887
I don't know where it came from,

18:56.970 --> 19:00.182
and Lord knows
I never saw it again after, but...

19:03.227 --> 19:04.520
That day,

19:06.438 --> 19:10.692
he wore a suit and tie for me.

19:13.695 --> 19:17.074
So, your angel gonna help us?

19:17.241 --> 19:19.535
Cassidy's working on it.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.496
We'll see. I trust him.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.167
Got a few hours. You wanna hit the tables?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.295
Our whole entire town just blew up, Jesse.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.882
Okay. What then?

19:36.844 --> 19:38.262
Let's get a room.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.436
What next?

19:49.439 --> 19:51.733
Bathtub seems like a good size.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.902
Maybe we'll give that a shot.

19:53.986 --> 19:55.279
I meant about God.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.406
We still doing that?

19:59.283 --> 20:03.078
Assuming Cassidy
can get this Saint character off our backs...

20:03.996 --> 20:05.539
We keep going.

20:07.124 --> 20:10.419
We keep looking for Him.
That's the plan, right?

20:10.502 --> 20:12.462
That's what we agreed.

20:12.588 --> 20:13.797
I know.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.718
But you don't have a church anymore, Jesse.

20:18.802 --> 20:22.139
And Annville's gone.
I mean, what does it matter?

20:22.264 --> 20:23.807
It matters more.

20:25.684 --> 20:29.146
Our hometown blows up
in a mushroom cloud of cow shit?

20:30.230 --> 20:33.442
The things He has to answer
for are piling up by the minute.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.821
Okay. Where do we look?

20:41.074 --> 20:42.534
I don't know.

20:44.578 --> 20:46.288
I just don't know.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.665
Don't fret.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.960
You'll figure it out.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.713
You're good at that.

20:54.796 --> 20:58.216
You're one of the best
figure-it-out-ers I know, Jesse Custer.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.053
Thanks, babe.

21:02.179 --> 21:03.472
Now what?

21:03.931 --> 21:05.349
Bathtub or closet?

21:11.855 --> 21:12.856
Let's get married.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.318
Excuse me?

21:17.444 --> 21:20.280
Well, I was thinking about what you said

21:20.364 --> 21:22.658
about Walter being your last and only family.

21:24.284 --> 21:27.829
Well, Annville's gone, but we're still here.

21:29.414 --> 21:32.376
I spotted a wedding chapel in the lobby.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.170
Let's get married.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.386
There you are.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.639
Let's talk.

21:56.233 --> 21:57.526
You hate marriage.

21:57.609 --> 21:58.610
When did I say that?

21:58.694 --> 22:00.487
You always said it was stupid and pointless.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.531
I'm pretty sure that was you.

22:03.532 --> 22:05.742
I just thought after
everything that's gone wrong,

22:05.826 --> 22:07.995
it might be nice for us
to have something go right.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.539
Maybe it is stupid.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.708
It's not as if we come
from families with great marriages.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.795
Whatever. I don't know. It's just a thought.

22:19.464 --> 22:23.510
Jesse Custer, that was
the worst marriage proposal

22:23.593 --> 22:25.137
I ever heard.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.768
Your basic ingredients here.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.895
Heroin. Rock cocaine.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.940
Lemon juice. Mineral water.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.650
Tap water these days.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.235
Who knows what's in it?
You know what I mean?

22:40.318 --> 22:41.445
I know what you're doing.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.571
What, have you done this before?

22:42.654 --> 22:45.032
No. You want me to change my mind

22:45.115 --> 22:46.825
about helping you, and I'm not going to.

22:46.908 --> 22:48.368
Hang on a minute.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.164
I am not here to change
anybody's mind about anything, all right?

22:52.330 --> 22:53.498
Now, look, we're mates.

22:53.749 --> 22:55.208
And I noticed you were looking down.

22:55.292 --> 22:56.626
I thought to myself, I thought,

22:57.085 --> 23:00.464
"My mate Fiore looks down.
I should go and cheer him up.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.049
"It's what I should do."

23:02.132 --> 23:03.508
And there's nothing like a bit of speedball,

23:03.592 --> 23:05.093
turn your whole day around.

23:08.013 --> 23:09.097
Come on.

23:09.181 --> 23:10.807
I have a 6:00 curtain.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.643
And you'll be there with bells on. All right?

23:16.772 --> 23:20.150
No, no, no. My friend,
first time means mainline, all right?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.527
Just keep your head still like that. That's it.

23:23.487 --> 23:25.447
All right. Hold still.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.828
There it is, mate.

23:34.664 --> 23:35.999
Nice, eh?

23:41.588 --> 23:43.673
Okay. Less heroin.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.768
<i>Well, my pad is very messy</i>

23:54.851 --> 23:56.603
<i>I got whiskers on my chin</i>

23:56.686 --> 23:58.480
<i>And I'm all hung up on music</i>

23:58.563 --> 24:00.232
<i>But I always play to win</i>

24:00.315 --> 24:02.150
<i>I ain't got no time for lovin'</i>

24:02.234 --> 24:03.944
<i>Cause my time is all used up</i>

24:04.027 --> 24:06.738
<i>I sit at my piano
All that groovy kind of stuff...</i>

24:07.030 --> 24:09.616
Deblanc and I had a legendary friendship.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.202
Legendary. He'd scream
at me sometimes, sure.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.537
But I'd scream right back at him.

24:13.662 --> 24:15.831
It was just that kind of thing, you know?

24:16.039 --> 24:17.791
He'd do something,
and then I'd do something

24:17.874 --> 24:19.126
in response and so on.

24:19.209 --> 24:22.087
A friendship like that?
I don't know how to describe it.

24:22.212 --> 24:23.296
Was it legendary?

24:23.380 --> 24:24.881
Yes. Exactly. Legendary.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.217
- How was the sex?
- What do you mean?

24:27.384 --> 24:28.385
You shared a room, right?

24:28.718 --> 24:30.595
- We shared everything.
- And you slept together?

24:30.887 --> 24:32.389
Course. We were best friends.

24:34.057 --> 24:35.183
More speedball?

24:36.476 --> 24:38.436
<i>If I had my choice of matter</i>

24:38.520 --> 24:40.313
<i>I would rather be with cats</i>

24:40.397 --> 24:42.023
<i>All engrossed in mental chatter</i>

24:42.107 --> 24:43.692
<i>Moving where our minds are at</i>

24:43.775 --> 24:45.485
<i>And relating to each other</i>

24:45.569 --> 24:47.404
<i>Just how strong our wills can be</i>

24:47.487 --> 24:49.322
<i>I'm resisting all involvement</i>

24:49.406 --> 24:51.575
<i>With each groovy chick we see...</i>

24:51.658 --> 24:54.619
So, the Saint
can kill angels, right?

24:54.995 --> 24:56.997
He can kill anyone. He killed Deblanc.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.250
All right. But, if angels, if they live in Heaven,

25:00.333 --> 25:02.002
where do dead angels go?

25:04.421 --> 25:06.256
That's the question. Isn't it?

25:08.341 --> 25:09.342
Yes, it is.

25:10.302 --> 25:12.721
<i>Well, I'm a man
Yes I am</i>

25:12.804 --> 25:14.639
<i>And I can't help
But love you so</i>

25:17.517 --> 25:20.520
<i>Well, I'm a man
Yes I am</i>

25:20.604 --> 25:22.606
<i>And I can't help
But love you so</i>

25:31.615 --> 25:34.492
Good God.
That Betty's a sly one, isn't she?

25:34.576 --> 25:38.288
With Veronica swishing about
all the time, she has to be.

25:57.349 --> 25:58.934
I mean, that's a lot of foreskins.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.185
Mmm.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.356
What do you think they're doing with 'em?

26:04.439 --> 26:05.899
Making money,

26:07.108 --> 26:09.569
putting 'em into whatever-ever they feel like.

26:11.696 --> 26:12.822
Like what?

26:12.906 --> 26:13.949
I don't know.

26:15.742 --> 26:19.329
Like bed linens, and lawn furniture, food.

26:19.704 --> 26:20.914
Could be a shite-load of foreskin

26:20.997 --> 26:22.666
in this here ice cream for all we know.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.337
Well, that would explain the creamy.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.680
Oh.

26:36.846 --> 26:40.350
"The creamy." Gross.

26:48.858 --> 26:52.362
Thanks. It'll be a wait.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.532
Love is in the air.

26:56.866 --> 26:59.869
Day cap at the bar? No fun doing this sober.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.374
Thanks. This is crazy.

27:04.499 --> 27:07.252
I know, right? We're getting married.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.379
Yeah. We all are.

27:10.380 --> 27:11.881
Good crazy though, right?

27:12.173 --> 27:13.508
Awesome crazy.

27:31.651 --> 27:32.861
I'm gonna go change my shirt.

27:33.236 --> 27:34.696
What's wrong with your shirt?

27:34.779 --> 27:36.197
Needs changing.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.312
It'll be fine. It's all gonna be fine.

28:10.523 --> 28:11.733
Hey, Tulip.

28:12.484 --> 28:14.402
Hey, Gary.

28:15.445 --> 28:16.696
Nice shirt.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.788
I remember
the first time I heard his voice.

28:27.624 --> 28:29.125
<i>Summer Wind</i>

28:29.959 --> 28:32.379
coming over the radio
at the Bangalore Bistro.

28:33.171 --> 28:34.631
Mmm-hmm.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.592
It's like velvet honey.

28:38.551 --> 28:39.928
Yep, Sinatra was...

28:40.011 --> 28:41.179
Like honey!

28:45.141 --> 28:47.435
Now what? This shit?

28:49.771 --> 28:52.774
Cannons and saws
and blowing your brains out?

28:56.111 --> 28:57.404
Savages.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.281
Animals.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.951
People like violence.

29:03.910 --> 29:06.496
Yeah. No, I get it. I get it.

29:06.579 --> 29:09.707
I like a good stabbing myself, now and again.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.838
But don't forget the music.

29:14.963 --> 29:17.799
Whatever it is, no matter the question,

29:19.008 --> 29:20.802
music's your answer.

29:22.345 --> 29:25.181
Maim and kill till you're blue in the face,
for all I care.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.808
But in the end,

29:27.851 --> 29:29.769
you gotta remember the music.

29:31.521 --> 29:33.857
"He came for the jazz."

29:34.023 --> 29:35.567
Holy shit, it's Ganesh!

29:36.025 --> 29:37.026
All right.

29:39.821 --> 29:44.200
Hey. Hey, I figured out where to go.
Where to look next.

29:44.284 --> 29:45.660
Great.

29:46.536 --> 29:48.538
- You talk to him?
- Yeah, it's taken care of.

29:49.247 --> 29:51.541
Seriously? He's gonna call off the Saint?

29:51.666 --> 29:54.002
Yeah. I think he needed someone to talk to.

29:56.504 --> 30:00.758
Hmm, great. Tulip and I'll get married,
then we'll hit the road.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.345
You're getting married?

30:04.429 --> 30:06.097
Kind of a spur of the moment kind of thing.

30:06.639 --> 30:09.976
- Crazy, huh?
- Uh, no, no. Not at all.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.062
- It was meant to be.
- Hmm.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.314
Actually.

30:15.773 --> 30:16.941
So, where is she now?

30:17.734 --> 30:19.527
I thought that was you at the bar.

30:20.278 --> 30:22.655
You were right.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.408
How are you, Gary?

30:25.492 --> 30:27.202
I'm extremely well. Everything's good.

30:27.285 --> 30:28.328
Good.

30:30.121 --> 30:31.247
You wanna come in?

30:32.790 --> 30:35.460
- You're not busy?
- Not at all. Come on in.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.717
Long way from Louisiana.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.802
Yeah, yeah.

30:44.928 --> 30:48.348
The boss sends me on the road
time to time to look in on things.

30:48.431 --> 30:51.309
Check the machines,
check the skim. You know,

30:52.644 --> 30:53.853
annoy the shit out of people.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.148
That's right.

30:57.232 --> 30:58.816
Viktor's got slots in Texas now.

31:01.319 --> 31:02.362
I forgot.

31:02.445 --> 31:04.322
- What about you?
- What you been up to?

31:04.405 --> 31:05.406
Good.

31:05.949 --> 31:07.075
Mmm.

31:07.659 --> 31:10.328
Hey, what's up with that priest from the bar?

31:10.537 --> 31:12.121
Oh, he's just someone I'm working with.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.415
Hmm.

31:15.458 --> 31:16.543
Looks like hard work.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.255
- Gary...
- Viktor's been looking for you.

31:20.338 --> 31:22.298
- I know.
- You should get in touch with him.

31:22.590 --> 31:25.051
He's been looking a long, long time now.

31:25.176 --> 31:26.719
I'm an asshole.

31:27.470 --> 31:29.347
I've been meaning to, and I will.

31:33.434 --> 31:34.477
How about now?

31:35.562 --> 31:36.646
- Now, now?
- Yeah.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.107
Well, I can't now. I have...

31:41.317 --> 31:42.527
- A thing.
- What is the thing?

31:42.610 --> 31:44.737
- Tulip, what is the thing?
- I have a thing!

31:46.281 --> 31:49.742
I just... I have a thing.

31:52.495 --> 31:53.955
Give me a break on this one, Gar.

31:55.164 --> 31:58.418
Okay? Say you didn't see me.

32:00.920 --> 32:05.508
Tulip, if it was me, maybe.

32:06.718 --> 32:07.927
Old times' sake.

32:08.595 --> 32:11.598
But Viktor's a different situation.
He wouldn't understand.

32:13.266 --> 32:14.309
Make the call.

32:16.185 --> 32:17.228
No.

32:18.479 --> 32:19.689
Then I will.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.193
Don't do that again.

32:32.410 --> 32:33.620
No reception. Damn!

32:36.039 --> 32:37.415
Come on.

32:38.875 --> 32:39.917
Damn it, come on.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.712
Come on. Give me some bars.

32:44.213 --> 32:45.882
Where's that signal?

33:03.066 --> 33:04.359
Come on.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.617
I can't do this now, Gary.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.578
Please. Not today.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.748
Bitch, I'm gonna kill you.

33:40.937 --> 33:42.230
Oh, man.

33:43.356 --> 33:44.732
My shirt.

33:45.316 --> 33:46.442
Jesus.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.070
What happened?

33:50.154 --> 33:53.074
Don't tell Jesse.

34:09.716 --> 34:12.009
May you remember the Lord.

34:12.093 --> 34:15.722
May this pious feeling
pervade all your activities.

34:15.805 --> 34:18.307
May you be righteous in your deeds.

34:18.766 --> 34:19.767
Amen.

34:28.985 --> 34:29.986
Women.

34:31.654 --> 34:33.197
The Saint?

34:33.281 --> 34:34.323
You can call him off?

34:34.407 --> 34:35.533
We hired him.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.661
His contract was with us. He'll do what I say.

34:38.995 --> 34:40.371
Then I can use the Word again?

34:40.663 --> 34:42.331
For the last time, no.

34:42.665 --> 34:44.125
Genesis isn't a toy.

34:44.208 --> 34:47.503
You, of all people,
have seen how dangerous it is.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.339
And so has the boy you sent to hell.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.344
- Eugene.
- Can I...

34:58.514 --> 35:00.141
You said once you can get him out for me.

35:00.224 --> 35:01.851
Yeah, well, that's not gonna work.
Not anymore.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.478
Besides, I'm never going back down there.

35:03.561 --> 35:04.771
We can't just leave him there.

35:04.854 --> 35:06.814
I'm never going back there.

35:07.523 --> 35:10.234
It's that bad? Hell?

35:15.907 --> 35:18.826
- Where is she?
- Relax. She'll be here.

35:23.039 --> 35:25.583
You were right. Genesis is not a toy.

35:26.459 --> 35:28.294
- I was wrong about that.
- Incredibly wrong.

35:28.586 --> 35:30.630
Unbelievably wrong. Stupendously...

35:30.713 --> 35:33.466
But, if the situation arises?

35:33.549 --> 35:35.343
If there is a time I think using the Word

35:35.426 --> 35:37.762
will bring me a step closer to finding God?

35:37.845 --> 35:38.846
I'm gonna use it.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.556
That'd be a big mistake.

35:40.640 --> 35:44.310
Yeah, you guys said that a lot.
"Genesis is a mistake."

35:44.393 --> 35:45.812
But I think it was meant for something.

35:46.354 --> 35:47.355
Like what?

35:47.438 --> 35:49.816
I said it before. Told you back in Annville.

35:50.483 --> 35:51.526
It was meant for me.

35:53.277 --> 35:54.362
Here she comes!

35:55.488 --> 35:56.781
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.950
- Where's Cassidy?
- He had to do something.

35:59.408 --> 36:01.327
Well, I don't wanna start without him.

36:01.410 --> 36:04.247
I thought you were gonna change your shirt?

36:04.330 --> 36:05.873
Jesse, I changed my mind.

36:06.415 --> 36:07.416
I like that shirt.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.210
I meant about getting married.

36:09.293 --> 36:10.711
No, thank you.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.674
Uh, guys?

36:15.800 --> 36:18.553
Guys! We're good.

36:19.762 --> 36:21.264
Cancellation, I repeat, cancellation.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.891
I need the Uribe and Hernandez parties
at their places now.

36:25.101 --> 36:27.728
You know what?
You were right about marriage. It's stupid.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.023
But you're the one that said that.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.609
Well, then I'm right.

36:33.860 --> 36:37.864
Look, I love you, you love me,
in the end, that's all that matters.

36:40.449 --> 36:41.617
Right.

36:44.453 --> 36:45.454
What do we do now?

36:45.580 --> 36:48.207
We do the keep looking
for God thing, like you said.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.628
Hey, you the, uh, angel that's gonna help us?

36:54.463 --> 36:56.716
Okay, cool. Thank you.

36:56.799 --> 36:59.468
Okay, that's done. Uh, I'll get Cassidy,

36:59.552 --> 37:03.306
and then we can go
and, you know, keep going.

37:08.144 --> 37:09.437
Thanks for this, mate.

37:11.606 --> 37:13.399
Oh, come here.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.946
Oh. All right. All right.

37:19.989 --> 37:21.824
That's enough of you now.

37:22.992 --> 37:24.076
Goodbye.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.954
Right, let's go.

37:27.038 --> 37:28.998
Heard about the wedding.

37:29.081 --> 37:33.002
It's fine. We agreed. Bad idea.

37:36.005 --> 37:37.840
Did something happen?

37:38.174 --> 37:39.216
When?

37:39.926 --> 37:43.930
Upstairs. With Tulip.
Feels like something happened.

37:45.681 --> 37:46.849
No.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.233
Good luck with your search.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.818
I never met God myself,

37:57.902 --> 37:59.862
but I hear good things.

38:00.363 --> 38:01.364
Mostly.

38:03.407 --> 38:05.409
Where will you go next?

38:06.327 --> 38:07.828
We're gonna follow the music.

38:09.288 --> 38:12.166
So far, we don't know much about God.

38:12.249 --> 38:16.045
What He looks like,
who He knows, and why He left.

38:16.545 --> 38:19.131
All we really know is He likes jazz.

38:19.215 --> 38:21.717
So stupid I didn't think of it before.

38:23.427 --> 38:26.847
If God likes jazz,
what better place to look for Him than...

38:26.931 --> 38:28.349
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans.

38:32.186 --> 38:33.187
Shit.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.321
Ready?

38:45.741 --> 38:47.118
What should I say?

38:51.080 --> 38:52.206
Find peace.

38:57.545 --> 38:58.754
Find peace.

39:24.947 --> 39:26.115
Find peace.

39:43.674 --> 39:46.719
Five minutes to curtain. Curtain in five.

39:53.309 --> 39:56.771
Our deal still holds?

39:58.814 --> 40:02.777
Kill Genesis and you'll see your family again.

40:09.158 --> 40:10.785
Tell me.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.335
He can't be trusted. I...

40:20.461 --> 40:21.879
I told him.

40:22.797 --> 40:25.257
But he's just gonna keep using it.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.389
New Orleans.

40:34.850 --> 40:36.477
That's where they're headed.

40:39.939 --> 40:41.107
Before you go,

40:43.734 --> 40:45.820
I've another job for you.

40:52.243 --> 40:54.453
I have to get out of here.

41:42.084 --> 41:43.627
That sucked!

41:45.421 --> 41:46.463
Fuck magic!

41:46.547 --> 41:47.798
I want my money back!
