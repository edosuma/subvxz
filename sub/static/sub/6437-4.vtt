WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.290
( laughter)

00:06.465 --> 00:09.172
Glaber: I did not care
for Varinius' hand upon you.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.423
Nor |.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.135
The girl, Naevia.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.342
- What did he say?
- Dead.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.098
The slaver told
not of her death,

00:18.268 --> 00:20.259
but of her suffering
in the mines!

00:20.437 --> 00:22.974
I stand with Crixus and will
see Naevia from bondage.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.263
I move for Vesuvius.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.352
Those that would live,
join me.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.313
Noble Varinius!

00:28.487 --> 00:29.476
I offer apologies.

00:29.655 --> 00:33.443
My soldiers have been set
to higher purpose!

00:33.617 --> 00:35.448
- Into the mines.
- Quickly!

00:35.619 --> 00:40.283
At this very moment,
they close on Spartacus!

00:40.457 --> 00:41.663
( cheering )

00:41.833 --> 00:43.164
You're safe.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.871
You're safe now.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.034
Crixus?

00:46.213 --> 00:48.545
- ( chuckles )
- See Naevia to safety.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.087
-(blade '
rIn s
-No! Q )

00:53.345 --> 00:55.336
(theme music playing )

01:03.897 --> 01:06.388
(birds chirping)

01:12.239 --> 01:13.729
( croaks )

01:58.243 --> 02:00.734
- ( whimpers)
- Shh.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.047
Shh.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.171
( screams )

03:02.349 --> 03:04.180
- Mira: Naevia!
- Halt!

03:05.352 --> 03:08.139
- Swing around to the left!
- ( yelling )

03:08.313 --> 03:09.689
Soldier: I've got her!

03:13.527 --> 03:17.941
(yells)

03:27.624 --> 03:29.535
(yelling)

03:41.555 --> 03:43.716
( panting )

03:44.808 --> 03:47.174
- You made me run.
- ( sobbing )

03:47.352 --> 03:49.308
I fucking hate running.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.219
(Mira screaming)

03:58.071 --> 03:59.572
- ( men grunting)
- ( metal clanging )

04:11.209 --> 04:13.996
- ( flesh squelches )
- ( bone cracks )

04:38.862 --> 04:40.944
I would see Tychos to ground,

04:41.114 --> 04:43.105
far from Roman hands.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.274
More come.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.115
- Soldier: For Rome!
-( horn sounds)

04:49.289 --> 04:51.780
(soldier yelling orders)

04:51.958 --> 04:53.243
Right.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.955
- There is no time for it.
- It does not fucking matter.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.245
We shall all join him soon.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.767
Spartacus shall fall.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.771
Is that not the reason
for my presence in Capua?

05:15.941 --> 05:17.397
To shit with reason.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.023
The absence of your troops
from the games

05:19.194 --> 05:20.855
was an insult to good Varinius.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.111
The Republic would bear
far greater slight

05:23.281 --> 05:25.272
were I to turn from purpose.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.442
Seppius has been searching
for the Thracian for months.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.360
How came you to divine
he would make attempt

05:30.539 --> 05:31.779
on the mines at Lucania?

05:31.957 --> 05:36.121
Because the gods
themselves presented it

05:36.294 --> 05:38.376
through voice
of humble servant.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.418
- Lucretia?
- Her counsel moved my hand.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.343
Perhaps your course
was justified then.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.346
I pray it true.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.177
Otherwise offense has been made

05:51.351 --> 05:52.932
upon the ramblings
of a madwoman.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.343
We have moved
past this, llithyia.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.761
ln spirit, at least.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.308
Let us make it a thing
of the flesh with celebration

06:01.486 --> 06:03.067
here within these walls

06:03.238 --> 06:04.728
to pay tribute owed.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.607
An excellent notion.
Well received, yes?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.276
It would stand the more
grievous insult to refuse.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.069
( chuckles )

06:14.541 --> 06:16.202
You honor me.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.037
The honor is mine.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.914
| only thought to help.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.594
By plying that preening shit

06:26.761 --> 06:28.467
with celebration
in our own house?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.048
Our house is in Rome, Gaius,

06:30.223 --> 06:32.885
and lwould speed return.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.471
With Varinius' support,
you will have Seppius' men.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.556
Now worth their weight in piss.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.223
When Marcus returns with
Spartacus as Lucretia fore--

06:41.401 --> 06:42.982
You place
too high a value on her.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.520
She will drag us to ruin
when it plummets.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.282
Lucretia continues
to prove herself

06:51.453 --> 06:54.069
worthy of such estimation.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.614
Would that my own wife
held the same.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.631
-(gaspS)
- Spartacus!

07:15.060 --> 07:17.221
- She needs a moment.
- She needs to fucking move.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.010
How quickly
would your feet carry

07:19.189 --> 07:20.520
after months
condemned to that place?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.555
She is not alone
in needing rest.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.100
The lack of it
sets nerve to edge.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.738
We will find higher ground,

07:30.909 --> 07:32.365
better defended if set upon.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.366
Can you walk but a little more?

07:34.537 --> 07:36.744
She will make it.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.826
Come on.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.245
The weight of her increases
with each step.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.254
Perhaps it is time
to lighten burden.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.461
I swore a promise to Crixus.
She is the man's heart.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.126
Would you again
tear it from his chest?

07:51.304 --> 07:52.840
Crixus is dead,

07:53.014 --> 07:54.470
and lwould be freed
of his woman

07:54.641 --> 07:56.973
before we fucking share
the same fate.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.304
We move for Vesuvius
to rejoin Agron,

07:59.479 --> 08:01.219
all of us.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.854
Speak of this again,
and the Romans

08:03.024 --> 08:04.525
will be the least
of your concerns.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.326
Ashur: Tychos,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.033
one of the lesser men.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.743
Let him serve as a warning

08:20.917 --> 08:24.580
that Rome is not
so easily defied.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.624
Their numbers dwindle.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.918
Yet ours follow
at more rapid pace.

08:34.097 --> 08:37.009
- Up!
- We still hold the greater sum.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.469
Spartacus and his men
are gladiators.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.682
A handful of your men

08:43.857 --> 08:45.097
would stand a pale shadow
against one--

08:45.275 --> 08:46.811
Roman soldiers
know something of death

08:46.985 --> 08:47.974
and the dealing of it.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.940
Do not measure their worth
against common slaves.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.696
Slaves, true,
but far from common.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.198
Move absent proper force,

08:55.368 --> 08:58.656
and see the rank
of the dead swell.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.037
Your men...

09:02.208 --> 09:04.585
are spread too thin
throughout the forest.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.994
A single man
carried by a swift purpose

09:07.172 --> 09:08.582
could return
with reinforcements--

09:08.757 --> 09:11.123
Carry word to the other squads.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.711
- We do not rest.
-Tﬁbunen

09:12.886 --> 09:14.592
See this to its end

09:14.763 --> 09:17.425
in the name
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.889
Turn from your charge,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.267
and I'll put a sword
in your fucking back.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.311
Varinius is a man
of the highest regard.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.230
See his cup always full

09:35.408 --> 09:37.569
and all desires met.
Am I understood?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.075
- Domina.
- Yes, domina.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.861
- ( laughs )
- It's true.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.746
Promise.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.249
Bathe and prepare yourselves.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.410
-( laughs)
- Seppia.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.705
Apologies. l was not
told of your arrival.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.590
None required.
I came seeking Lucretia's counsel.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.254
A thing desired by many,
it would seem.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.933
Your words set her to path.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.432
Mine?

10:02.602 --> 10:05.139
You are forever extolling
the virtues of marriage.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.644
Wisdom of years

10:06.815 --> 10:09.272
has finally proven
master over fatuous youth.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.103
You've found a husband
so quickly?

10:11.277 --> 10:13.768
If the gods bless such a union.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.778
I shall entreat them
on your behalf.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.486
With their favor,
Varinius shall be yours.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.534
Varinius?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.740
Is he not handsome
and tall and strong

10:23.915 --> 10:25.200
and of means?

10:25.375 --> 10:29.709
The form of a man every woman
longs to call her own.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.961
He would make a husband
to rival all others.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.542
(Seppia giggles)

10:33.716 --> 10:35.126
I must prepare myself
for his celebration.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.802
lwould catch his eye

10:36.970 --> 10:39.461
and, with it, see the rest
of him swiftly follow.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.761
You have made
impression upon her.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.231
As have you.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.986
No longer is pilgrimage
needed to Delphi.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.989
Those seeking
the consideration of the gods

10:59.159 --> 11:02.276
need only bow
to the oracle of Capua.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.663
lam but humble vessel

11:07.834 --> 11:10.246
offering a mere taste
of their will.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.036
Then Seppia shall find tonight
a bitter draft.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.715
Varinius is a praetor.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.673
As is your husband.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.051
Yet Varinius
rises more quickly

11:20.221 --> 11:22.007
and one day shall
hold title of consul.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.800
The wife of such a man must
possess refinement and poise,

11:25.977 --> 11:29.185
traits yet lacking
in a spoiled little girl.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.059
Perhaps you would have me

11:32.233 --> 11:33.734
petition the gods
for a different union...

11:35.278 --> 11:37.064
one closer to heart.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.109
The morning cock
has better chance

11:40.283 --> 11:41.614
of crowing
to such heights.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.366
Your husband believes otherwise,
as does your father.

11:47.081 --> 11:50.369
When Marcus returns
absent Spartacus,

11:50.543 --> 11:52.283
you shall be revealed
as what you are,

11:52.462 --> 11:54.043
an empty vessel,

11:54.214 --> 11:58.127
barren of life and prophecy.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.300
See yourself
dressed for tonight.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.551
l have no doubt my husband

12:02.722 --> 12:05.555
will wish to parade you about
as favored pet.

12:05.725 --> 12:10.344
Your husband's trust
is valued gift.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.934
Yet yours would prove
the greater treasure.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.808
Soldier:
Open the gates!

12:16.986 --> 12:18.692
Packers, tend to your horses!

12:18.863 --> 12:21.320
( overlapping chatter)

12:31.042 --> 12:32.532
( chuckles )

12:32.710 --> 12:34.416
Soldier: Line them up!

12:37.340 --> 12:40.173
The faith placed in me
is not mislaid.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.005
Spartacus proves
where I predicted.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.510
Praeto r.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.421
This is all that stand captured?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.385
Many more lay dead
in the mines.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.961
Your Gaul returns
to you at least.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.463
Where is Spartacus?

13:25.638 --> 13:28.971
He fled into the woods
with a clutch of slaves.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.598
Marcus gives chase.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.135
Alert me the moment
he is sighted upon road.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.275
- To the cells.
- Move!

13:41.446 --> 13:45.485
Even aided
by your divine guidance,

13:45.658 --> 13:47.990
he stands with empty hands.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.494
He will yet find
Spartacus between them.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.824
The gods--

13:52.999 --> 13:54.660
Your tongue writhes
absent their purpose.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.166
Was Naevia not found
in the mines as l foretold?

13:57.337 --> 14:00.170
And who so condemned her
to such a place?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.205
Juno...

14:02.383 --> 14:04.465
or a lanista's wife,

14:04.635 --> 14:06.842
more earthly bound?

14:07.013 --> 14:09.846
Your prophecies bear
the stench of opportunity.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.347
Oenomaus--

14:11.517 --> 14:13.018
Was delivered
by your dead husband's man,

14:13.186 --> 14:16.644
a toad who has seen
his share of wounds.

14:19.567 --> 14:23.936
I wonder if he
could mend them as well.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.119
Do not think me the fool

14:33.289 --> 14:35.575
as my husband and father.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.205
You and l have
unfinished affairs...

14:41.214 --> 14:43.830
and I would see them
draw to a close.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.514
Get in!

14:50.681 --> 14:52.012
( laughs)

14:52.183 --> 14:54.799
Again to this house
of piss and shit.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.558
A fate I alone should bear.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.060
The risk was known to us all.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.938
Fuck risk,
and fuck the fucking Romans.

15:01.109 --> 15:04.067
I stand with you
in this life and the next.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.977
As do |.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.235
The bonds of brotherhood.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.652
They have always run deep
within these walls.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.909
Oenomaus.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.258
How did you come here?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.919
lwas a fool...

15:33.349 --> 15:34.930
that now stands
in fellow company.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.432
Their fault lies

15:36.602 --> 15:38.638
only in following me
on impossiblejourney.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.719
Naevia lives.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.979
We liberated her from the mines.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.603
Love.

15:50.241 --> 15:53.108
You fall to ruin for love.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.487
She is my heart.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.448
She is a woman...

16:01.794 --> 16:04.376
a delicate creature
at the best of times.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.460
They are moved by desires

16:08.634 --> 16:11.467
unknown by the men
that place trust in them.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.389
That is all that matters.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.610
(gasping )

16:36.120 --> 16:38.202
Mira: Shh.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.953
You're safe now.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.407
You are safe.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.368
You do not rest?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.323
I would not see
another of us fall.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.953
Not even the gods could have
done more to prevent it.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.128
A thought holding
no comfort to the dead.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.548
( Naevia screams )

17:32.718 --> 17:34.219
- Naevia.
- ( men shout )

17:36.722 --> 17:39.259
- ( Naevia screams )
- Liscus!

19:02.975 --> 19:05.682
- ( wails )
- Nasir.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.720
He risked life to save my own.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.690
And I am forever in his debt.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.442
( yells )
You were right.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.146
My sword becomes lighter

19:19.325 --> 19:20.986
with each Roman l have taken.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.445
(gasping )

19:32.213 --> 19:34.374
- ( music playing)
- J‘ Aphrodita J‘

19:34.548 --> 19:36.880
J‘ Aphrodita J‘

19:37.051 --> 19:39.133
J‘ Aphrodita J‘

19:39.303 --> 19:42.511
- J‘ Aphrodita J‘
- J‘ Aphrodita J‘

19:42.682 --> 19:44.673
(singing in Latin)

20:04.995 --> 20:06.860
Most impressive showing.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.655
Staggers to think
this house so recently a tomb.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.370
J‘ Aphrodita... J‘

20:11.544 --> 20:13.375
These walls truly present

20:13.546 --> 20:15.502
no evidence
of witnessed horrors.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.755
J‘ Aphrodita, Aphrodita. J‘

20:17.925 --> 20:20.086
- ( yells )
- ( screams )

20:22.346 --> 20:24.803
Such memories shall soon
be cleansed from thought,

20:24.974 --> 20:26.384
never again to darken mind.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.220
I long for such a day.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.305
Let us hasten it
with ample libation.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.058
I fear Mercato
may lose himself

20:33.232 --> 20:34.312
in the bottom of a cup

20:34.483 --> 20:36.519
and forget that
we are of position.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.525
I would never
make spectacle of myself.

20:38.696 --> 20:39.685
(giggles)

20:39.864 --> 20:41.070
Gallienus:
Come then.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.534
and my own as well!

20:46.704 --> 20:48.945
l have never
beheld sour Gallienus

20:49.123 --> 20:51.239
in such high spirits.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.408
This celebration already
proves clever suggestion.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.577
To be made brilliant

20:55.755 --> 20:57.711
if Spartacus's capture
were to be announced.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.425
The gods may yet bless us this night
with unexpected gifts.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.716
Let us entreat them
with wine and song,

21:06.891 --> 21:09.257
our voices to carry
to Olympus itself.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.019
This house once sat
perched within its reach.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.727
l have worshiped here
myself upon occasion.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.391
(Varinius laughs)

21:19.862 --> 21:21.602
Good Cossutius.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.237
I had not heard
you were in Capua.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.943
He comes for my games.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.450
And to remove himself
from the prudish eyes of Rome.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.952
Ah! Both just cause.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.784
llithyia: Come.
Let us enjoy spectacle.

22:07.201 --> 22:09.533
Truly a feast for the senses.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.115
Even I stand speechless.

22:12.289 --> 22:15.076
Then I shall seize
upon rare moment...

22:16.836 --> 22:19.168
to honor noble guest.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.088
Good citizens of Capua,

22:23.259 --> 22:25.250
your presence

22:25.427 --> 22:28.169
here in this house
once stood cursed

22:28.347 --> 22:31.180
is testament
to your courage and faith,

22:31.350 --> 22:32.681
faith not only in me,

22:32.852 --> 22:35.264
but in the body
of the Senate as well,

22:35.437 --> 22:38.645
represented
by beloved Albinius...

22:38.816 --> 22:41.353
- Good Albinius!
- ...and noble Varinius.

22:41.527 --> 22:44.860
( applause )

22:45.030 --> 22:47.772
A man worthy of celebration

22:47.950 --> 22:51.534
for his generosity in providing
distraction with games

22:54.832 --> 22:56.663
( applause )

22:58.210 --> 23:00.201
Man:
Praise Praetor Varinius.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.289
- ( overlapping chatter)
- To the Republic!

23:04.466 --> 23:06.002
See how they admire you.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.379
Man:
Good Varinius.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.261
(applause continues)

23:15.728 --> 23:17.719
The girl takes
your counsel to heart.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.559
And | repay
your kind attendance

23:20.733 --> 23:24.066
with welcome news
of retribution.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.646
(crowd murmurs)

23:25.821 --> 23:27.231
My soldiers return

23:27.406 --> 23:30.739
with news of Spartacus'
imminent capture...

23:30.910 --> 23:32.901
- ( crowd
gaspi
- Yes! ”Q )

23:33.078 --> 23:35.239
( cheering )

23:36.332 --> 23:38.744
And offer in advance

23:38.918 --> 23:42.752
the lives of the few
surviving remnants

23:42.922 --> 23:45.914
of his most trusted men.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.823
These gladiators...

24:15.120 --> 24:18.612
these slaves,
were responsible

24:18.791 --> 24:22.750
for the deaths
of many of your noble kin...

24:24.213 --> 24:25.919
and they will pay...

24:27.299 --> 24:28.584
with blood.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.875
(crowd yelling )

24:33.305 --> 24:35.387
Praetor Varinius.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.806
Pressing concerns
forced hand

24:37.977 --> 24:40.639
in preventing my men
from presenting at your games.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.597
I offer you the lives
of these enemies of Rome

24:44.775 --> 24:47.357
to balm unintentional wounds.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.447
Man: Cut the pig!

24:53.617 --> 24:55.528
( crowd cheering )

24:57.663 --> 24:59.403
Man:
Come on, we want blood!

25:15.681 --> 25:18.013
Gratitude for this honor

25:18.183 --> 25:21.971
and for your tireless pursuit
of the villain Spartacus.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.521
- Yet I cannot accept.
- ( crowd gasping )

25:29.028 --> 25:30.768
I cannot accept,
because to do so

25:30.946 --> 25:34.404
would rob the people of this
city of deserved pleasures.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.149
Let these men
not fall here tonight

25:37.327 --> 25:39.113
in the honor of a single man,

25:39.288 --> 25:42.530
but in the arena
before all of Capua!

25:42.708 --> 25:45.040
( cheering )

25:45.210 --> 25:47.041
Man:
Justice be had!

25:47.212 --> 25:49.373
- Great Varinius!
- ( applause)

25:56.722 --> 25:58.713
(water splashing )

26:00.934 --> 26:02.435
Water!

26:10.569 --> 26:12.105
(gasping )

26:16.492 --> 26:18.107
Drink.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.739
The boy fought well.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.154
Would this were wine to send him
properly on his way.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.699
You speak of him
as if already gone.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.788
Then he speaks the truth.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.372
Naevia is burden enough.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.753
We have settled this.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.380
Come to reason.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.415
There is more blood upon
the ground than within him.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.835
Even if we carry him,
he will not survive.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.253
But he will leave a trail,

26:39.431 --> 26:40.511
one that the Romans
shall follow.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.388
We cannotjust leave him.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.850
No, we cannot.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.143
You would take his life?

26:51.401 --> 26:53.266
I would but sever
dangling thread.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.527
It would be a kindness.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.688
You will not touch him.

26:57.866 --> 27:00.027
Then do it yourself.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.818
Put him from misery,
as you did Varro.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.541
Crixus.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.291
He survived worse

27:17.469 --> 27:19.425
against Theokoles.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.221
The boy too will live

27:23.392 --> 27:25.929
if his wound
is sealed with fire.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.554
Fire would call
the Romans down upon us.

27:30.732 --> 27:31.983
Then we must be quick

27:32.151 --> 27:34.733
and be gone before they arrive.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.484
And if we are not?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.987
We do not have enough men.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.648
No, we do not.

27:44.454 --> 27:47.617
Find Agron
and bring all to purpose.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.496
We will follow as swiftly
as we are able.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.335
I fear it will not
be swift enough.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.505
(music playing )

28:30.250 --> 28:32.241
( laughter)

28:34.713 --> 28:37.329
(no audible dialogue)

28:44.056 --> 28:46.547
Trussed as game
awaiting slaughter,

28:46.725 --> 28:49.432
yet the man
still eyes us as prey.

28:49.603 --> 28:52.845
The fire will soon be put
from rebellious eyes.

28:53.023 --> 28:54.388
A fitting end
to your games, Varinius.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.147
It shall be a day
etched in memory.

28:56.318 --> 28:58.684
I cannot wait to see their blood
spill upon the sands.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.239
- ( giggles)
- Nor l.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.239
Yet should they not fall here,
in the very place

29:04.409 --> 29:07.742
they robbed our beloved
cousin Sextus of his life?

29:09.081 --> 29:11.914
A man dearly missed.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.918
It is a pity he shall
not be honored this night.

29:16.088 --> 29:19.205
Would the greater honor
not be before all of Capua?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.421
(Varinius chuckles)

29:23.595 --> 29:25.381
We are politicians, are we not?

29:25.555 --> 29:28.092
Let us come to middle ground
and see everyone satisfied.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.098
Choose a single man,

29:30.269 --> 29:33.056
and let us make sport of him
in memory of your cousin.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.854
A most judicious compromise.

29:37.025 --> 29:41.439
Seppius is not the only one
who stands injured.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.228
The gods themselves took note

29:43.407 --> 29:44.772
of the horrors
inflicted upon Lucretia

29:44.950 --> 29:48.317
and pluck her from
the shores of the afterlife

29:48.495 --> 29:50.031
to voice their desires.

29:50.205 --> 29:53.447
Should she not choose
what blood is shed

29:53.625 --> 29:56.913
beneath roof
she once claimed her own?

30:02.092 --> 30:06.461
She has been
most sorely grieved.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.550
If there are no objections...

30:10.559 --> 30:12.891
What mortal
dares defy the gods?

30:13.061 --> 30:15.268
Only one who would draw
their wrath.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.067
Varinius has seen fit

30:29.244 --> 30:32.077
to allow us a taste
of the blood to come,

30:32.247 --> 30:35.330
a single man to be sacrificed
to this house

30:35.500 --> 30:37.752
where so many lives
were stolen

30:37.919 --> 30:40.661
by Spartacus
and his jackals,

30:40.839 --> 30:43.831
to be chosen
by its former domina,

30:44.009 --> 30:47.467
the gods themselves
guiding her hand.

30:47.637 --> 30:50.424
( applause )

31:18.960 --> 31:20.621
The gods have chosen.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.211
This one.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.748
( cheering )

31:29.888 --> 31:31.719
We shall draw lots

31:31.890 --> 31:33.721
and cut but shallow
to prolong the game.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.554
Seppius to stand first,
in honor of fallen cousin.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.765
Fuck the lot of you Roman cunts!

31:41.233 --> 31:42.222
( laughs)

31:42.401 --> 31:44.733
( overlapping chatter)

32:04.047 --> 32:07.585
Do not think that the gods
have shown you mercy.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.841
l but delay your passing

32:10.011 --> 32:12.002
so that I may savor it.

32:12.180 --> 32:16.594
My life is gladly given

32:16.768 --> 32:18.554
for Naevia's.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.102
She lives?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.264
( chuckles )

32:23.442 --> 32:26.184
Far from your fucking grasp.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.735
News greeted with joy.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.942
I would have her hear
of your final moments

32:32.117 --> 32:35.359
in the arena
you held so dear

32:35.537 --> 32:37.823
and the crowd
which once cheered your name

32:37.998 --> 32:40.159
spitting upon you.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.658
And when you fall,

32:42.836 --> 32:44.918
it will not be as champion,

32:45.088 --> 32:46.624
but as a common slave,

32:46.798 --> 32:49.210
absent honor
and absent glory

32:49.384 --> 32:52.342
and your name
forever lost to history.

32:54.764 --> 32:58.097
( muffled grunting )

33:00.145 --> 33:02.636
- ( yelling)
-( laughter)

33:04.316 --> 33:07.399
Let this shit speak now
of Romans!

33:07.569 --> 33:09.184
( cheering )

33:10.822 --> 33:13.108
(groaning continues)

33:15.118 --> 33:17.404
First blood has been drawn!

33:17.579 --> 33:19.615
Who stands next?

33:23.293 --> 33:26.000
Remember, do not cut too deep.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.833
I would not deprive
everyone fair turn.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.918
( laughter)

33:31.092 --> 33:33.708
Varinius in town
but a handful of days,

33:33.887 --> 33:36.674
and already
outshines your husband.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.930
The man does exude...

33:39.100 --> 33:41.136
presence.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.176
- The breast!
- ( yelling )

33:45.565 --> 33:48.181
-( laughs)
- ( applause)

33:50.862 --> 33:53.854
But your heart was
always set upon Gaius.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.614
It is a deceitful thing
that has led many astray.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.197
Well, the fault
stands equally shared,

33:59.371 --> 34:01.157
for succumbing
to your teary-eyed pleas

34:01.331 --> 34:03.538
in defense
of misplaced affections.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.039
(grunting continues)

34:05.210 --> 34:07.872
Years have proven them so.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.332
Yet mistakes of youth

34:10.507 --> 34:12.498
need not forever
haunt maturity.

34:12.676 --> 34:15.008
( laughter)

34:18.306 --> 34:20.171
You would see
marriage dissolved?

34:20.350 --> 34:22.136
I do not hold such power.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.937
That decision lies
in trusted father.

34:29.109 --> 34:32.067
Well, Gaius is not without
considerable fault.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.694
Yet it would not lend
favorably upon your name.

34:34.864 --> 34:38.231
You carry his child,

34:38.410 --> 34:40.196
and he yet holds position
of praetor.

34:40.370 --> 34:44.238
He is not the only one
with such title.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.405
( screams )

34:45.584 --> 34:48.872
Let him bleed.
Let him bleed.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.629
It would seem the gods favor
less mature schemes.

34:53.883 --> 34:55.384
Strike it
from your thoughts,

34:55.552 --> 34:57.588
as l have from mine.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.377
Don't be greedy, Gallienus.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.512
- Leave us some.
- I'm trying.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.183
(screaming )

35:13.361 --> 35:15.443
(laughing)

35:19.701 --> 35:20.690
Mira: He is fading.

35:20.869 --> 35:23.281
Fetch something for him
to clutch between teeth.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.250
When it is done,

35:31.421 --> 35:33.252
we must smother fire
and move quickly.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.040
I've seen that look

35:37.218 --> 35:39.709
and the blame
it inflicts inward.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.379
None other deserve it.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.969
We chose to do this,

35:45.143 --> 35:47.634
even fucking Liscus.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.303
Glaber does not send
his men against Liscus.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.973
He sends them against me,
and all suffer because of it.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.561
Yes.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.647
It is because of you

35:56.821 --> 35:58.812
that we are free.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.107
(grunts)
What are you doing?

36:02.285 --> 36:04.662
We must close your wound.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.492
I am to be branded with fire,

36:08.667 --> 36:10.658
as a true gladiator would.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.247
You have earned your place
amongst the brotherhood.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.051
Hold him down.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.551
Do not cry out.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.553
( muffled gasping )

36:32.565 --> 36:34.066
The fire, quickly.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.783
Soldier:
Smoke sighted!

36:48.957 --> 36:50.913
Take my sword. Go.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.629
( laughter)

36:58.800 --> 37:00.586
The man fades.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.136
As do I...

37:02.303 --> 37:05.045
from prying eyes.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.679
( laughs)

37:08.893 --> 37:11.179
I do not care for the way
he looks at me.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.685
Few women do.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.392
Come, it is your turn.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.729
( chuckles )
l have never held one before.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.359
My brother would not allow it.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.859
( chuckles )
Well, then it falls

37:24.033 --> 37:26.115
to more experienced hands
to guide you. Come.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.657
(Seppia giggling)

37:37.213 --> 37:40.046
You do not care
for your master's affections?

37:40.216 --> 37:41.956
lam slave to no man.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.751
Yet you bow and scrape
toward Varinius' purpose.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.181
If it aids me in pursuit
of Spartacus.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.131
I would have done so as well,

37:50.310 --> 37:52.892
absent attempt
to fuck your sister.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.927
Magistrate, a word.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.896
(giggling)

38:05.283 --> 38:07.490
Varinius: Now place
the tip against flesh...

38:09.120 --> 38:11.156
...and feel it part
at your desire.

38:11.331 --> 38:14.118
(giggling)

38:30.600 --> 38:31.965
Uh...

38:32.143 --> 38:34.634
lcannot

38:36.606 --> 38:38.096
Apologies.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.859
Our honored guest

38:47.033 --> 38:49.445
asks too much
of inexperienced hands.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.742
( crowd gasping )

39:05.093 --> 39:08.961
Your wife does not shy
from taking life.

39:10.056 --> 39:12.263
| only regret
she moves prematurely,

39:12.433 --> 39:14.890
robbing deed
from more deserving hands.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.108
That is how you sate desire,

39:24.279 --> 39:28.067
for love or vengeance,

39:28.241 --> 39:30.448
without hesitation.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.412
( chuckles )

39:37.041 --> 39:38.872
- ( applause )
- Yeah!

39:46.551 --> 39:48.837
( revelry echoing )

39:55.435 --> 39:58.222
It is a sight, is it not,

39:58.396 --> 40:00.728
all of Capua laid at your feet?

40:00.899 --> 40:02.639
It is not the view,

40:02.817 --> 40:05.809
but quiet respite
from celebration that draws me.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.740
l have shattered it
with prattling tongue.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.239
Apologies.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.569
Linger.

40:12.744 --> 40:16.032
I would not sweep you
from perch once your own.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.540
It seems a lifetime ago
I called it so.

40:20.710 --> 40:23.417
Time flees from us all,

40:23.588 --> 40:26.921
leaving regret for what might
have been churning in our wake.

40:27.091 --> 40:30.504
I fear we share much
in such regard.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.930
A husband lost.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.428
A wife...

40:34.599 --> 40:36.260
Dearly missed.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.428
Let us turn to common joy

40:41.606 --> 40:44.268
of friend and daughter.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.184
llithyia. Hmm.

40:47.362 --> 40:50.320
The name fails to lighten
troubled thoughts.

40:52.784 --> 40:57.118
Give them voice,
and see them fly to the heavens.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.574
I've not the lungs
to shout so loud.

41:01.626 --> 41:04.413
Then whisper desire to me,

41:04.587 --> 41:08.171
and I shall entreat the gods
to see them satisfied.

41:13.388 --> 41:16.221
YOurcounsel
would be much appreciated.

41:40.707 --> 41:41.992
(twig crunches )

41:47.839 --> 41:49.124
Where's Fortis?

41:49.298 --> 41:51.459
We avoided one squad of Romans.
A second, we could not.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.295
I lost Fortis
in the woods as we fled.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.676
- Which direction?
- The one which you travel in.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.428
We shall break west

41:57.598 --> 41:59.384
and hope to miss them
before righting course.

41:59.559 --> 42:00.799
And if we do not?

42:02.186 --> 42:03.175
Then they shall learn

42:03.354 --> 42:05.185
that a wounded animal
may yet bare teeth.

42:33.176 --> 42:34.416
But of course we can.

42:34.594 --> 42:36.630
(women giggle)

42:38.598 --> 42:40.463
You overreach,

42:40.641 --> 42:43.132
and hot tears burn in result.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.141
Turn from him...

42:49.400 --> 42:51.311
and dry your eyes.

42:54.906 --> 42:58.069
Let us leave this fucking house

42:58.242 --> 43:02.406
and see memory of this night
fade in warm embrace.

43:05.291 --> 43:06.827
Yes, brother.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.257
(Varinius laughs)

43:17.428 --> 43:19.259
Crassus, yes.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.593
Yes, l have dined and bathed
with him on many occasion.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.600
A man large of coin,
small of cock.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.385
( laughter)

43:27.563 --> 43:30.225
His wife has often
spoken of it...

43:31.442 --> 43:33.433
in far grander terms.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.110
Seek more wine.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.941
I shall join you presently.

43:40.618 --> 43:44.452
Your eye flits from young
to younger still.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.032
lf celebration stretches,

43:46.207 --> 43:49.574
I fear to discover you
with a newborn clutched in hand.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.127
llithyia, lwould not see

43:53.297 --> 43:55.379
my jest towards Crassus
reach his ear.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.919
And what do you offer
to purchase my silence?

44:03.099 --> 44:05.260
What is it you seek?

44:05.434 --> 44:07.425
Favor for your husband?

44:08.729 --> 44:11.471
l have secured many
for him over the years.

44:13.568 --> 44:19.359
Perhaps it is time to place
myself higher in concern.

44:19.532 --> 44:22.365
It would be well deserved.

44:22.535 --> 44:25.368
Why do you chase
after simple little girls,

44:25.538 --> 44:27.574
barely formed of breast?

44:27.748 --> 44:29.955
They are unencumbered

44:30.126 --> 44:31.662
of marriage...

44:33.087 --> 44:34.748
and obligation.

44:39.886 --> 44:44.129
And if a woman your equal
stood removed from such?

44:47.351 --> 44:50.843
We speak
in ever-tightening circles.

44:55.109 --> 44:57.475
I would see them
come to a point.

45:10.082 --> 45:12.209
My father never favored Gaius.

45:16.631 --> 45:21.375
If a more suitable husband

45:21.552 --> 45:24.715
with equal title

45:24.889 --> 45:26.379
and greater promise

45:26.557 --> 45:29.139
were to make
his intentions known...

45:30.686 --> 45:32.722
You play a dangerous game.

45:41.656 --> 45:45.240
With stakes worth the risk.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.491
Your name...

45:47.662 --> 45:49.698
wed to my father's--

45:50.706 --> 45:53.118
power and wealth

45:53.292 --> 45:56.876
to rival Crassus himself.

46:00.049 --> 46:02.711
Gain your father's approval
to dissolve your marriage...

46:04.053 --> 46:08.046
and find me as wet
with desire as you now stand.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.269
(music playing )

47:11.203 --> 47:13.694
( panting )

47:51.744 --> 47:53.609
Fuck the gods.

47:58.042 --> 47:59.703
Fortis.

48:02.380 --> 48:03.916
Back the way we came.

48:06.801 --> 48:10.259
Soldier: ...to the northwest,
General.

48:11.764 --> 48:14.255
(soldiers yelling )

48:15.434 --> 48:17.220
Soldier: One, two, three, four.

48:17.395 --> 48:18.760
Go!

48:18.938 --> 48:21.680
(all yelling)

48:43.921 --> 48:45.206
( blade rings)

48:46.924 --> 48:48.915
- Liscus!
-( Roman yells)

50:07.254 --> 50:09.040
( metal clanging )

50:09.215 --> 50:10.705
( groans )

50:10.883 --> 50:13.044
Did I not fucking warn you?

50:35.324 --> 50:36.609
A serious wound,

50:36.784 --> 50:38.695
- but you should live--
- Call the remaining squad.

50:38.869 --> 50:41.485
It will not make a difference.

50:41.664 --> 50:43.950
Spartacus is possessed
by the gods themselves--

50:44.124 --> 50:45.580
Spartacus is here!
Bear arms!

50:45.751 --> 50:47.036
You will draw them to us.

50:47.211 --> 50:49.998
And we will fight until
the last drop of Roman blood--

50:50.172 --> 50:52.959
lam not a Roman.

50:54.301 --> 50:56.087
And I will not
fucking die this night.

50:57.263 --> 50:58.844
( blade squelches )

50:59.014 --> 51:01.300
( gasps )

51:04.770 --> 51:06.635
( Spartacus yells )

51:06.814 --> 51:08.805
(coughing)

51:10.192 --> 51:12.103
We must move before more come.

51:13.612 --> 51:15.853
lam done running.

51:21.078 --> 51:23.194
Do not fucking
let this be for nothing.

51:24.790 --> 51:26.030
Live...

51:27.960 --> 51:30.042
and see many Romans fall.

52:01.118 --> 52:03.200
You really believe
this will save you?

52:04.455 --> 52:06.912
Maneuvering my father's cock
inside you?

52:07.082 --> 52:08.333
You mistake intent--

52:08.500 --> 52:10.877
Do not attempt to twist
fucking word to advantage.

52:11.045 --> 52:12.876
I will not be placed
beneath your heel again,

52:13.047 --> 52:14.708
you withered cunt.

52:16.133 --> 52:19.091
You think so low of me?

52:19.261 --> 52:22.048
Based upon lasting memory
of blood and betrayal.

52:23.182 --> 52:26.424
I've done many things
to hurt you,

52:26.602 --> 52:29.309
because I was jealous

52:29.480 --> 52:32.313
of your position,
your beauty,

52:32.483 --> 52:34.849
your youth,

52:35.027 --> 52:36.517
moved by base passions

52:36.695 --> 52:40.529
which served only
to wound my own heart.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.985
lwould do anything, llithyia,

52:43.160 --> 52:47.244
to erase injury
my actions have caused.

52:47.414 --> 52:49.666
You remember
what happened between us?

52:51.752 --> 52:53.367
I remember everything.

52:55.339 --> 52:58.172
Do not think I will be
so easily threatened.

52:58.342 --> 53:01.129
Again, you mistake intent--

53:05.391 --> 53:07.302
Mistake is yours.

53:11.647 --> 53:14.138
I will dash your head
against the stones

53:14.316 --> 53:15.647
- as I did Licinia...
- Wait.

53:15.818 --> 53:18.104
...with tales of how
you lost wits and came to me.

53:18.278 --> 53:19.609
- Your father--
- Will not mourn

53:19.780 --> 53:21.236
the passing of a faded whore.

53:21.407 --> 53:23.898
He will dissolve your marriage!

53:24.076 --> 53:27.159
That is the reason
I took him to my thighs...

53:28.747 --> 53:31.204
to sway him to your cause
of wedding Varinius.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.831
That is what you desire,
is it not?

53:33.001 --> 53:34.787
Even if it were,

53:34.962 --> 53:38.079
why would my father be moved
by serpent's tongue?

53:38.257 --> 53:40.543
The gods speak through me.

53:41.760 --> 53:45.127
He sees wisdom
in their counsel.

53:46.432 --> 53:47.922
I did it for you, llithyia...

53:49.309 --> 53:52.096
to secure future
for you and your child.

53:55.816 --> 53:58.102
lwould mend rift between us...

54:00.112 --> 54:03.024
one torn by my own
foolish hands.

54:12.374 --> 54:15.787
Perhaps it is I
that have been foolish...

54:20.299 --> 54:23.837
to ever doubt such dear friend

54:24.011 --> 54:26.468
was blessed by the gods.

54:38.859 --> 54:40.190
Laughter and drink

54:40.360 --> 54:41.861
have done much
to dispel darkening gloom.

54:42.029 --> 54:43.394
Good.

54:44.531 --> 54:47.147
But yet I fear shall
see split head come morning.

54:47.326 --> 54:48.862
( laughter)

54:49.036 --> 54:50.492
