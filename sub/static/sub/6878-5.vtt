05:02.343 --> 05:03.637
I could have come to get it.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.555
Really not

05:03.678 --> 05:05.555
a big deal. Lilly?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.348
You look nice.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.226
-Uh...

05:07.390 --> 05:09.226
-Thank you.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.228
You been busy, huh?

05:11.270 --> 05:12.353
Back in the saddle?

05:12.395 --> 05:14.773
What does that mean,

05:12.395 --> 05:14.773
the saddle?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.858
That means you Twittered

05:14.815 --> 05:16.858
and, you know,

05:16.900 --> 05:18.485
date with Dr. Harris.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.446
-And that is for work.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.364
My bad.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.741
Miss Forgetful,

05:24.783 --> 05:27.368
I will be charging you

05:24.783 --> 05:27.368
for miles.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.246
Thanks, daddy.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.246
Sorry.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.371
Did you talk

05:29.288 --> 05:30.371
to your mom yet?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.332
-About what?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.332
-It's not--it's nothing.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.374
It's fine.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.374
Can we leave soon?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.626
I'm gonna be late

05:33.416 --> 05:34.626
for algebra.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.212
Yeah, just go see

05:34.668 --> 05:37.212
if your brother's almost ready.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.215
What is that about?

[whispering] I think

05:40.257 --> 05:41.382
she's having a hard time.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.342
She got her hopes up,

05:41.424 --> 05:43.342
but, uh...

05:43.384 --> 05:44.636
Did she say

05:43.384 --> 05:44.636
something to you?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.763
She needs to speak

05:44.678 --> 05:46.763
to you, okay?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.849
-Okay, I will get on that.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.849
-All right, great.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.476
I just haven't found

05:48.890 --> 05:51.476

Are you okay?

to grace us with his--

Hey, Jo.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.248
Who the hell are you,

06:11.621 --> 06:13.248
and what have you done

06:13.290 --> 06:14.415
with my fat dirtbag of an ex?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.293
-Mom, be nice.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.293
-Honey, it's okay.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.544
It's a fair statement.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.879
Okay, well, wow.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.463
Uh, so what kind of business

06:18.920 --> 06:20.463
brings you out here?

06:20.505 --> 06:21.923
You on a nationwide search

06:20.505 --> 06:21.923
for a third family?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.466
Mom.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.926
It's good to see L.A.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.926
hasn't softened your edge, Jo.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.427
Oh, no, it hasn't.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.430
No, look, I just

06:26.469 --> 06:29.430
wanted to pop in and say hi.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.308
-Uh-huh. Hi.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.308
-Hi.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.809
I'm on my way

06:31.350 --> 06:32.809
to some investor meetings.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.435
You know, they shouldn't

06:32.851 --> 06:34.435
take too long.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.855
Maybe you and I could sit down

06:34.477 --> 06:36.855
while I'm here, catch up.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.439
Yeah, maybe you're high.

Yeah, no.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.900
That's not gonna happen,

06:39.941 --> 06:43.444
but the kid's excited to see you

06:39.941 --> 06:43.444
and spend some time with you.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.322
Yeah, dad, there's

-Yeah.

You don't make friends

Dad's changed.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.930
He really has.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.434
And then maybe

07:12.391 --> 07:14.434
we could decorate the place

07:14.475 --> 07:18.313
with some fun prom themes

07:14.475 --> 07:18.313
like Under the Sea.
