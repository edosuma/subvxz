This is my friend, Jamie.

Hey, how are you?

02:48.736 --> 02:49.768
Man, I feel at home.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.070
You want to have it?

02:51.072 --> 02:52.606
Yeah, yeah, whatever you're having.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.083
- You guys wanna smoke some weed?
- Yeah.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.243
Yeah, it's just Chilean weed, man.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.941
I hear that it lasts,
like, eight hours,

03:05.976 --> 03:08.808
and that the peak of it is
really like four hours into it.

03:08.843 --> 03:10.952
Yeah, that's true but one
thing you wanna make sure...

03:10.958 --> 03:12.659
Yeah, yeah, well, I read the
doors of perception, you know.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.794
He describes it basically as like
we have a reducing valve in

03:15.796 --> 03:20.699
our consciousness and like, this kind
of like opens up your, you know...

03:20.701 --> 03:22.034
...your valve, your reducing valve?

03:22.136 --> 03:23.735
Huxley?
Yeah, I've heard of that book.

03:23.737 --> 03:24.903
I've actually never read it.

03:27.942 --> 03:28.740
Hi!

03:28.742 --> 03:31.176
These are my friends...
This is Jamie...

03:31.178 --> 03:33.645
It's really important that
you fast if you take it...

03:33.647 --> 03:35.347
- You have to fast?
- 12 hours before or something?

03:35.349 --> 03:37.082
Yeah, you should...
Don't exaggerate , but...

03:37.084 --> 03:40.052
- Want some?
- No, uh, I'm tired of that.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.119
Whatever knocks you out.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.221

03:45.593 --> 03:47.192
- You have experienced...
- Jamie: Yeah.

03:47.194 --> 03:50.112
I'm not afraid of like ... stuff.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.967
- Is that Chilean cocaine?
- Yeah, it's Chilean cocaine, you like that?

03:55.969 --> 03:58.203
Can I get some of this, because I
haven't had very good cocaine in Chile?

03:58.205 --> 03:59.404
Yeah, manu, come we get you some...

03:59.506 --> 04:01.006
- Can I buy some?
- Do you have more?

04:01.108 --> 04:03.909
Yeah, I mean...
I can ask a friend.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.144
Yeah, I know, it's like really...
This is actually really good.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.147
You know, and the weed is nice,
too, that you have because

04:09.149 --> 04:11.950
the other weeds I've had here have
been, you know, a little heady,

04:11.952 --> 04:14.719
like, you can feel a pressure
on your face and like, you can't

04:14.721 --> 04:16.988
think through a clear thought...
But this one was really nice.

04:16.991 --> 04:20.225
Yeah, it sounds like you've done
a lot of drugs here and stuff.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.728
Not life, though, you know,
I don't get high on life every day.

04:22.730 --> 04:26.532
God, I would probably drop dead.

04:26.734 --> 04:30.235
You wanna get out of this room?
It's like really uncomfortable in here.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.103
Hey, thank you.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.740
- What was her problem?
- Why?

04:34.742 --> 04:37.376
She's like, "I'm high on life," and
then she's like doing cocaine?

04:37.378 --> 04:39.678
- Ah, forget it.
- I find that shit so annoying.

04:39.980 --> 04:44.483
I have to take a shit, that's like
crazy, poisonous, Chilean drugs.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.618
I'll see you.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.153
Hello, is someone in here?

04:48.155 --> 04:50.558
I'm sorry!

05:46.813 --> 05:50.482
- Hey, who's she?
- Yeah, she's an old friend, man.

05:50.484 --> 05:53.107
- Isn't she amazing?
- I love her!

05:55.255 --> 05:56.655
Shall I go out with
the other one then?

05:56.657 --> 05:58.990
The other one is like, a dark cloud.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.625
What the fuck is she doing, man?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.928
Oh, poor thing!
She's like a lonely tornado.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.563
Let's go dance with her?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.631
Well, she's embarrassing
herself, right?

06:06.633 --> 06:07.632
Yeah.  Me also.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.869
The other one's being nice to her,
she's not like kicking her out.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.804
Somebody save her!
I'm gonna try.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.006
Oh, really?
Good luck, man...

06:14.008 --> 06:16.010
In case she needs it!

06:18.612 --> 06:21.513
- Hola!
- Hola!

06:21.515 --> 06:23.014

06:26.253 --> 06:28.019

06:28.021 --> 06:30.689

- Hi!

06:30.691 --> 06:32.124
- Listen to me.
- Yeah.

06:32.126 --> 06:34.525
You're embarrassing yourself.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.596
Am I embarrassing yourself, you mean?

06:37.598 --> 06:41.733
- We're all one self, man.
- Yeah!

06:41.735 --> 06:43.768
One giant consciousness.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.838
What, what's your religion?
Are you religious or something?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.274
That's like doors of perception
shit you're saying, you know?

06:49.276 --> 06:51.276
You ever read that book?
You know that book?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.844
- Aldous Huxley?
- The Doors of Perception...

06:52.846 --> 06:54.681
- Yes!
- Yeah!

06:55.783 --> 06:58.350
- Champa!
- Hola, amigo.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.118
- How are you, man?
- Hey, good, how are you doing?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.154
- Fine.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.055
- Maca? Jamie.
- Jamie, my friend.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.393
- This is Crystal Fairy.
- Sorry?

07:07.795 --> 07:10.128
And this is Champa.  I live
with him, we live together.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.630
- Champa...
- Your name again, sorry?

07:11.632 --> 07:12.630
Crystal Fairy.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.366
She's gonna come with
us to the north tomorrow.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.435
She's gonna come in the Suburban,
and we'll all drive together,

07:16.437 --> 07:19.037
and there'll be a female
presence now on the trip.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.438
- Is that cool?
- Uh...

07:20.440 --> 07:21.606
She wants to drink San Pedro.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.576
But... are you coming
in the car or in the...

07:24.578 --> 07:26.244
She'll come in the Suburban.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.647
Uh, hey, it's a problem because
the Suburban is kind of

07:29.649 --> 07:31.876
full because I'm taking my
little brothers, you remember?

07:31.911 --> 07:34.018
- You don't think we can all fit?
- Oh, I don't want to be an imposition.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.388
- Maybe take a bus then, meet us there.
- Yeah, I'll take a bus!

07:37.024 --> 07:39.157
And then call me when you
get there and we will find you.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.326
I took the bus all over Argentina,
have you done that?

07:41.328 --> 07:43.395
That'll be fun.  You
just take a bus and go...

07:43.697 --> 07:45.263
Perfecto, perfecto.

07:45.265 --> 07:51.285
Hey, if I give you my
phone number... 9-5-0-3-0.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.275
- You have to come.
- ...You have the bus?

07:57.277 --> 07:58.577
- Copiapo.
- Copiapo, that's it.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.847
Just go on Google and type in boose or
just type in bus, it's like the same word.

08:01.849 --> 08:05.450
I'm going to go and
look at the moon now.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.184
Wow...

08:06.186 --> 08:08.887
- This is such a good omen.
- That's amazing.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.189
We should get going soon,
because I think we're

08:11.191 --> 08:13.191
gonna... we going to get up
like really early and go?

08:13.193 --> 08:16.227
- Yeah, yeah. I'm kind of tired, man.
- Yeah, me too.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.829
I might do a little more of that
blow, I have a little more left.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.665
- You wanna do some?
- No, thank you man.  No, no.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.633
- Okay, I'm going to do it.
- See you later.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.669
Then we'll go soon.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.669
Yo, Jamie, dude.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.488
- Hola, amigo.
- We need to go, man.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.658
- Yeah, I'm just making one drink.
- It's too late. No more drinks, man.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.927
No, no.
I'm going man, sorry.

08:48.929 --> 08:53.165
- If you wanna stay, okay, but...
- Hey, I've got a little more blow.

09:05.121 --> 09:08.580
Bye.  I'll call you
tomorrow, okay?

09:08.782 --> 09:12.051
- Get home safe.
- Yeah, you too.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.499
- Hi.
- Hi! Fucking me.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.802
Hi, what?
I can't afford it.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.906
- Tell her I can't afford it.
- Good night.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.741
- What's she saying?
- She wants apple.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.376
No, I'm not giving you my apple!

10:11.378 --> 10:16.881
How many dicks have
you sucked tonight?

10:16.883 --> 10:19.150
A lot.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.786
What are their names?
What are your names?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.622
- My name is Hannah.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.889
And Botota.

We'll cook you dinner.

I'll cook you dinner.
Come... a la casa!

10:31.531 --> 10:33.653

10:47.681 --> 10:49.414
I'm going to bed, I'm so tired.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.249
Yeah, I'm so tired too.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.486
I'm just going to cook this and eat this
with them, I think, and go to bed too.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.954
Yeah, the girls are waiting, man.

10:55.956 --> 11:00.525

11:07.267 --> 11:09.435
Hey...

11:10.037 --> 11:12.304
What's the situation?

11:16.810 --> 11:21.047
Are you going to sleep after this,
or are you gonna be working?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.750
Oh, no.

11:25.052 --> 11:25.984
Working!

11:25.986 --> 11:27.552
Working, working.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.120
Yeah, I got it.
You've been...

11:29.122 --> 11:31.656
How long have you been
doing that kind of work?

11:31.658 --> 11:37.095
No, no, eh...
Hmm... Aburrida.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.564
- Perfect.
- But you don't enjoy it.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.466
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.401
Oh, you gotta go work right now.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.204
Yes, yes.
Want have the dollar.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.541
- Okay, okay.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.817

Yo, Jamie!</i>

- Hola... hola...

13:11.491 --> 13:14.392
What's wrong?  You were supposed
to be waiting down here with the stuff.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.593
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.296
Yeah, please hurry up, man.
My little brothers are waiting.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.231
Um, can you give me 10 minutes?

13:20.233 --> 13:22.200
We're kind of late, man.
Please hurry up.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.036
- Come up.
- Okay.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.638
We don't have to shout like this.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.612
I'll be waiting in the car, man.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.973
Okay, Lady Botota.
I'll be five minutes.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.659
- Wow...
- Yo, man.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.561
Great car.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.063
Yeah, the only problem
is, it's so expensive.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.598
It spends too much gas.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.133
I'll cover gas, man.
I'll cover gas.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.936
- Really? Cool, thanks.
- No worries.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.807
I'm sorry those women
were scaring you last night.

14:02.909 --> 14:05.977
- So crazy.
- They were fun.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.745
I liked Botota.. yeah, like,
I liked Botota because

14:07.747 --> 14:10.849
she was kind of quiet but Hannah
kept like, getting aggressive with me.

14:10.851 --> 14:14.419
This is the perfect thing in my
life right now, to do mescaline.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.221
I'm just getting into all this,
really getting heavy in to all

14:17.223 --> 14:21.392
this phenomenology stuff and it's
all related, you know, it's like...

14:21.394 --> 14:23.695
So your brothers
are gonna take it too?

14:23.697 --> 14:25.797
Did they decide they want to?

14:25.799 --> 14:27.765
Yeah, I think so.
That's what they tell me, yeah.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.201
So I have to get
enough because, uh...

14:30.203 --> 14:34.172
I don't wanna take, like, you know,
less than the recommended dosage.

14:34.174 --> 14:34.939
We should all...

14:34.941 --> 14:38.009
We should make sure there's enough
for us to all do the right amount.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.445
If not, maybe they'll
just hang out or something.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.696
<i>- Yo!
- Pilo.</i>

14:58.698 --> 15:00.331
- How are you, man?
- Good, how are you doing?

15:00.333 --> 15:03.034
- Fine, you?
- I'm dead, man.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.909
Exhausted, man, we did
so much cocaine last night.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.172
We could hardly sleep.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.174
I did more than him, but...

15:10.876 --> 15:13.077
Somebody put some like
Klonopin in it or something.

15:14.117 --> 15:15.474
Yeah, bring those.

15:26.019 --> 15:28.010
<i>Hey, Lel.</i>

15:28.512 --> 15:31.195
Hey, are you going to drink
this San Pedro with us?

15:31.197 --> 15:32.397
- San Pedro?
- Yeah.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.465
We'll have a psychoactive
voyage, you know?

15:34.467 --> 15:38.436
Oh... Yeah, yeah.
It's true.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.240
It's just a plant, you know, I mean,
it's just the San Pedro cactus.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.541
It's been an ancient tradition.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.009
They've been doing it
for hundreds of years.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.312
It's like... it's really traditional.

15:55.717 --> 15:59.257
- What are you saying?
- I'm trying to translate what you said.

15:59.259 --> 16:02.727
It's, it's safe.
Don't worry!

16:02.729 --> 16:05.697
Uh, Jamie?
My knees... it's like...

16:05.699 --> 16:07.665
- Sorry, man, I'm tired.
- Yeah, but please...

16:07.667 --> 16:11.169
- Is that better?
- Yeah, yeah. Great man. Thank you.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.605
<i>â™ª ...I'm the king of</i>

16:14.607 --> 16:15.807
<i>bungle, baby, I'm the king</i>

16:15.809 --> 16:17.008
<i>bungle... [indistinct] â™ª</i>

16:17.010 --> 16:18.576
<i> â™ª King of the bungle,</i>

16:18.578 --> 16:21.446
<i>King of the bungle â™ª</i>

16:21.448 --> 16:23.381
<i>â™ª Hear me when I come, baby</i>

16:23.383 --> 16:24.949
<i>â™ª King of the bungle,</i>

16:24.951 --> 16:27.085
<i>King of the bungle â™ª</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:15.933
<i>Jamie, you want an empanada?
Cheese?</i>

17:15.935 --> 17:18.469
- No, meat empanada?
- No, no, I don't think...

17:18.471 --> 17:19.871
Does he have coffee or something?

17:19.873 --> 17:21.137
- Do you have coffee?
- Cafe..?

17:21.339 --> 17:24.492
Is it... real coffee or is it...?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.843
- Instant coffee.
- Yeah.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.987
Are you not hungry, man?
You haven't eaten all day.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.455
Oh, you don't know
what they put in them.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.191
When they make them
in these places, you know.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.859
I had that bad experience,
you know, I ate...

17:41.861 --> 17:43.061
Oh, yeah, I remember.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.763
An empanada and I... got really sick.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.632
I had to lie in bed all day.

17:55.711 --> 18:00.511
Yeah, I threw up on the
driveway...  Gracias.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.839
- Hello?
Hey, Jamie, it's me, Crystal.

19:40.796 --> 19:41.916
<i>Yo, Jamie, your phone.</i>

19:45.842 --> 19:46.986
Hello?

19:47.353 --> 19:52.790
<i>Oh, my God, it's me, Crystal!
Jamie!  Can you hear me?</i>

19:52.792 --> 19:55.593
<i>I'm on a bus, I'm on
my way to Copiapo...</i>

19:55.595 --> 19:57.195
<i>I hope you're on your way there.</i>

19:57.197 --> 19:59.431
<i>Listen, let's meet
at the main square.</i>

20:00.433 --> 20:02.831
- That was Crystal Fairy.
- What?

20:02.866 --> 20:05.803
- Crystal fairy, from last night.
- The crazy dancing girl?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.238
- Wow, yeah.
- Yeah, so?

20:07.240 --> 20:10.074
She just called me.  She says
she's on a bus to Copiapo.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.910
She's gonna meet us in
the square, she says.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.980
- Are you serious, man?
- How did she get my phone number?

20:15.982 --> 20:18.616
Fuck, you gave it to her, man.
Don't you remember?

20:18.618 --> 20:21.619
Ah, I gave it to her
and she memorized it.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.015
This girl we met last
night at the party...

20:26.326 --> 20:27.825
Oh, that wasn't an invitation.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.360
I just told her what our plan was.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.862
- Yeah, it was an invitation, man.
- What is her problem?

20:31.864 --> 20:33.564
Why did she think I was inviting her?

20:33.566 --> 20:37.368
Because you gave her your
cell phone and you told her to go.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.970
- That is an invitation.
- That's not...

20:38.972 --> 20:42.106
- That was not an invitation.
- Well, I knew it, man, fuck.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.004
Why do you want to go
to the Plaza?

20:56.122 --> 20:57.941
We don't have to
adopt this fairy just 'cause

20:57.980 --> 20:59.920
we talked to her for
five minutes at a party.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.660
Nobody wants to adopt the fairy, man.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.986
But anyway, you invited
her, so, you know like,

21:06.021 --> 21:09.230
since if she's there at least and...
I don't know.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.902
- You are...
- Well, you're the one driving,

21:11.904 --> 21:14.605
you know, if you want to go,
we can go check it out.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.681
Yeah, let's do it, man.

21:20.491 --> 21:21.912
<i>Oh, great.</i>

21:24.176 --> 21:28.122
- Who's this guy?
- This guy helps people, like, park.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.056
Okay, look for a white girl.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.292
- A white girl?
- She's a gringa.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.495
Do you have any other reference?
I don't... like, her hair or something?

21:37.497 --> 21:38.730
I don't know what
else to say about her.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.798
I don't remember that
much else about her.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.032
What are these guys doing?

22:00.396 --> 22:02.119
That over there, that group of women.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.355
It's like a whole group
of fairies over there.

22:11.834 --> 22:13.664
This isn't mine, this isn't mine...

22:13.666 --> 22:17.435
Pink shirt there, I think.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.938
Oh, this is nice, right
in the middle of a park.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.507
No, no!

22:23.509 --> 22:26.344
I think that...
Hey...

22:28.081 --> 22:30.715
Oh my God, oh my God!

22:30.717 --> 22:32.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:33.686 --> 22:35.052
Hey, hey, hey!

22:46.733 --> 22:48.399
The drawing, I gave them a drawing.

22:48.401 --> 22:51.035
I gave them two fairy drawings.

22:55.876 --> 22:59.372
What are they saying?
Ow!

23:00.346 --> 23:01.579
Very bad karma!

23:02.982 --> 23:04.782
They're going to have very bad karma.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.355
I'll take my drawing back.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.024
Why are you even
talking to them, you know?

23:18.961 --> 23:20.498
They're really going
to have bad karma.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.969
I mean, they're just
drowning in evil and hate.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.804
I feel so sorry for them, I really do.

23:26.806 --> 23:27.805
What did you say to them?

23:27.807 --> 23:30.768
I... they wanted them, they wanted...

23:35.197 --> 23:38.749
Man, I'm so sorry, God.
That was insane.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.117
Yeah, absolutely insane.

23:40.119 --> 23:42.219
They, like, were pulling
my hair out, you know?

23:42.221 --> 23:44.588
My shirt. That woman ripped
my shirt for no reason.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.056
Yeah, whatever.
It's over, man.

23:46.058 --> 23:49.693
Let's get out of here.
As soon as possible.

23:56.275 --> 24:00.838
<i>Welcome to the group,
Crystal Fairy.</i>

24:25.504 --> 24:29.166
Hey boys, chicos?
Do you think they have...

24:29.168 --> 24:30.468
Do you have any fresher lettuce?

24:30.470 --> 24:34.104
Can you ask her that?

24:34.106 --> 24:36.440
Wait a minute, is this
what you guys are buying?

24:36.442 --> 24:39.877
Oh, boys, boys.
This is a nightmare.  No.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.412
We're going to have fun with this.

24:41.414 --> 24:43.514
All sugar.  This is all,
let me see this.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.616
- Chito pake?
- You don't eat sugar?

24:45.618 --> 24:48.018
What is this puppy?
This is how you poison?

24:48.020 --> 24:51.055
It's not funny. You're very
cute, but it's not funny.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.691
Pure poison, basically, for your body.

24:53.693 --> 24:57.394
Your pretty faces are
going to be destroyed.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.730
Oh.  What am I
going to do with you?

24:59.732 --> 25:02.766
Hey, Crystal, they like, they just
eat like this in Chile, you know?

25:02.768 --> 25:04.668
You're not going to change
the way these guys eat.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.905
Jamie, do you know what's going on
in America with this sugar epidemic?

25:07.907 --> 25:10.241
- You've seen that it's destroying...
- Yeah, they don't really

25:10.243 --> 25:11.841
get that here, you know?
It's like not the same.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.512
We've gotta spread the word!
It is the same thing as Adenol...

25:14.514 --> 25:15.696
You should just get
your vegetables and

25:15.697 --> 25:17.342
they'll get whatever
they want and you know...

25:17.377 --> 25:19.416
I'm going to share the
cheese pops with you.

25:19.418 --> 25:22.853
You share your cheese pop with me, I'm
gonna share my vegetables with you.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.188
- Champa versus Crystal.
- I dare you.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.358
Sugar, vegetable food off!

25:29.662 --> 25:32.397
It's gonna be fun.

25:33.699 --> 25:37.101
- She's kind of exhausting, huh?
- Nah, it was fun, yeah.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.733
Man, what if we
honestly just find a hostel

25:39.734 --> 25:41.442
and drop her off at
a hostel or something?

25:41.477 --> 25:43.374
No, man, you can't be serious.
You want to leave her alone?

25:43.376 --> 25:45.610
Is she really going to come all the
way to Pan De Azucar with us?

25:45.612 --> 25:47.878
I mean, can you imagine
having her around?

25:48.548 --> 25:51.448
Leave her at a bus stop, you know?
It's like, we've done our job.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.817
But she's, like,
part of us, you know?

25:53.819 --> 25:56.960
She's not part of me, man.
I hardly know her.

26:01.674 --> 26:06.463
- Jamie!
- Amigo.  Yeah.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.893
Yeah, we're probably going
to need some tampons now

26:08.894 --> 26:10.761
that we're dragging
this woman around.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.337
Get her some deodorant too.

26:16.867 --> 26:19.663
Yeah, that's great.
Get one of those.

26:20.379 --> 26:25.516
Man, do you think this is going to be
crazy to have her with us the whole time?

26:25.518 --> 26:27.017
Like, who she is?

26:27.119 --> 26:29.453
If you guys are cool with it,
though, I mean, you know.

26:29.455 --> 26:30.654
You guys are patient.

26:30.656 --> 26:32.523
I just don't want it to ruin your trip.

26:32.525 --> 26:35.659
- She's not for me.
- Yeah, she'll be... no, it'll be cool.

26:35.661 --> 26:40.398
If she gets weird, we'll
figure it out or get rid of her.

26:43.102 --> 26:47.893
Okay, guys, there's room.
Let's get going.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.441
Cool.

26:52.063 --> 26:53.944
- That's mine.
- Okay.

27:06.305 --> 27:10.394
- What did she say, Champa?
- The room is only for four persons, but...

27:10.396 --> 27:12.931
- There's four of us.
- There are five.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.188
No problem.

27:22.641 --> 27:26.948
- Jamie, I've been here before.
- When?

27:27.613 --> 27:29.613
Exactly.

27:35.509 --> 27:37.249
That's creepy.

27:55.608 --> 28:00.911
I'm telling Pilo to give
his bed to Crystal Fairy.

28:00.913 --> 28:01.779
- Oh, no.
- What?

28:01.781 --> 28:03.380
- No, no.
- Why?

28:03.382 --> 28:05.750
- I'm happy on the floor.
- I don't mind sleeping on the floor.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.678
- No, no, I don't.
- She's a woman, come on.

28:07.713 --> 28:09.187
She's a woman?
What difference does it make?

28:09.189 --> 28:11.889
- Don't be sexist.
- He's right, we're all the same.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.291
Come on, I can sleep
on the floor, really.

28:14.293 --> 28:15.959
- Yeah, you're okay with it.
- Yeah.

28:15.961 --> 28:18.800
- Yeah, you should have a bed.
- No, really, I don't mind.

28:18.801 --> 28:21.465
- No last minutes.
- Yeah, you should have a rest.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.334
- Pilo, are you sure?
- Yeah, it's fine.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.036
Ah! Thank you.

28:26.038 --> 28:29.540
Oh, you boys are so
sweet and wonderful.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.708
Oh.

28:30.710 --> 28:33.744
God, what was going on in that
park today before you got there?

28:33.746 --> 28:39.450
Those women, that was just, nuts, they
were like, the true expression of Kali.

28:39.452 --> 28:43.026
I mean, they had all the
incredible goodness and

28:43.027 --> 28:47.698
the love in them and then all the
darkness and evil and it just... bam!

28:47.699 --> 28:51.530
It came together and it
just was unleashed upon me

28:51.533 --> 28:54.970
in such a moment of wild humanity

28:54.975 --> 28:58.836
and then out of nowhere,
you guys were just... there.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.071
- Yeah, that was crazy.
- It was amazing.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.573
Okay, I think I need a beer.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.475
You want to go buy a beer with me?

29:04.477 --> 29:05.976
- That's a good idea.
- Bring some beer back.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.945
I would like some beer.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.414
Would you like
anything, Crystal Fairy?

29:10.416 --> 29:12.984
Um...

29:13.786 --> 29:16.153
You know, no, no.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.254
- I'm okay.
- You're good?

29:17.256 --> 29:18.422
Thanks.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.711
Thank you, sweet boys.

29:23.662 --> 29:25.262
Okay, what would rather do?

29:25.264 --> 29:27.230
Stick your nose into
Crystal Fairy's armpit

29:27.231 --> 29:29.330
and breathe in through
your nose for two hours

29:29.335 --> 29:31.980
or make out with your
father for two hours?

29:33.205 --> 29:35.873
Really try and imagine both.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.408
Um...

29:38.410 --> 29:41.512
I think I'll pick my father.

29:41.514 --> 29:42.913
- And you too.
- I don't blame you.  Yeah.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.482
I would have picked your father too.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.661
No, honestly, man, if
she gets on your nerves,

29:47.662 --> 29:50.854
which I'm pretty sure
will happen, tell me.

29:50.856 --> 29:54.453
Don't hold it in. Like, tell
me and I'll deal with her.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.960
Okay, thank you.
Seriously.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.094
What happened to the fairy?
Did she fly away?

30:31.596 --> 30:34.909
No, she's taking a shower, man.
Will be cool.

30:34.944 --> 30:36.834
That sounds good.
She could use that.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.349
We were playing this
game on the street,

30:38.350 --> 30:40.145
would you rather, or
what would you rather.

30:40.180 --> 30:41.505
You know this game?

30:41.507 --> 30:44.308
What about a horse, you walk
into a room, there's a horse.

30:44.310 --> 30:47.544
You have to eat the entire horse
before you can leave the room or

30:47.546 --> 30:50.914
you shave your father's pubic hairs
every Sunday and eat them.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.716
10 horses before that, man.

30:52.718 --> 30:59.056
Or run backwards for 40
kilometers with this in your ass?

30:59.058 --> 30:59.857
I have a question.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.764
If you don't eat your
grandfather in two hours,

31:01.765 --> 31:05.150
if the two hours go by and he's
not entirely eaten, what happens?

31:05.364 --> 31:11.132
An endless stream of human shit coming
out of your ears for the rest of your life

31:11.133 --> 31:13.927
and it's like, just part of your life.
It's like, liquid shit.

31:16.075 --> 31:19.977
Or a small man who's this tall...

31:19.979 --> 31:22.144
Living with you for the rest of
your life and he follows you around

31:22.145 --> 31:23.863
and just watches your every move.

31:28.543 --> 31:31.355
- Welcome back.
- Hey.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.457
Would you like a beer?
Yes, please.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.525
I highly recommend the
showers for everybody.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.193
- Beer.
- Oh, yeah.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.863
Yeah, a shower sounds fantastic.

31:39.865 --> 31:40.677
Oh.

31:46.005 --> 31:48.138
Yeah.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.375
Ah, mm.
Can I have that?

31:51.377 --> 31:53.704
- Yeah, of course.
- Gracias.

31:55.214 --> 31:58.010
Mmm, mmm.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.952
Oh, my God, yes.

32:01.954 --> 32:04.855
I'm so glad I remembered.
You guys.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.458
- Okay, let's see.
- Oh, those uglies...

32:08.761 --> 32:13.230
Okay, I've been saving these for months,
I didn't know why and now I know why.

32:13.232 --> 32:18.265
They're blessed with the ability
to open up all your chakras

32:18.266 --> 32:20.065
to receive positive energies,

32:20.066 --> 32:21.979
which we all need to do for
the San Pedro, you know,

32:21.980 --> 32:24.228
so that we're in that good frame
of mind we were talking about.

32:24.263 --> 32:28.138
We're supposed to ingest
their essence with liquid,

32:28.139 --> 32:29.839
so let's have them
in our beers, yeah?

32:29.848 --> 32:32.182
- That's cool.
- It's okay with beer, or it has to be with...

32:32.184 --> 32:34.818
- No, no, it's good with beer. Yes.
- That's cool shit.

32:34.820 --> 32:39.182
You have to keep this, okay?
You drink it and then you keep it.

32:43.828 --> 32:46.108
Thank you, Crystal Fairy.

32:47.833 --> 32:50.734
I'm okay.
I don't like shit in my drinks.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.870
No, no, no, it's important that
you ingest the essence of this.

32:53.872 --> 32:58.502
I like just ingesting beer by itself.
It's like a weird thing I do.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.749
So, um, Crystal Hairy,
why are you naked?

33:08.687 --> 33:11.655
You like that, Pilo?
You like Crystal Hairy?

33:11.657 --> 33:13.557
I like Crystal Hairy, that's good.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.993
It's fine, I mean...  Sorry, I just
thought we should talk about it.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.128
'Cause you're like...
your pussy's hanging out,

33:18.130 --> 33:20.659
it's like you wanna
talk about it or something?

33:20.799 --> 33:23.467
Am I making you
uncomfortable, Jamie?

33:23.469 --> 33:27.771
Honestly, it's like... kind of hard to be
comfortable and just act like it's normal.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.173
Okay, well, I'll put some clothes on.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.409
It's cool for me, Crystal Fairy.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.715
- Yeah, whatever, I mean.
- I'm okay with your nudity.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.848
What's the plan for tomorrow?

33:37.850 --> 33:39.950
Tomorrow, we're going
to get to San Pedro.

33:39.952 --> 33:46.832
Lobo told me Tierra Amarilla and you
have to look at the yards of the houses

33:46.833 --> 33:52.167
and you find, and you like,
ask the people and offer them to,

33:52.168 --> 33:55.248
I don't know,
an exchange or to buy it.

34:13.710 --> 34:17.828
Champa!
Champa!

34:20.092 --> 34:24.628
Your bag!

34:24.630 --> 34:26.710
Hey, we're going.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.400
Jamie.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.469
I feel a lot of aggression
coming from you.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.036
Is there something
you want to talk about?

34:34.039 --> 34:37.373
- Have I upset you?
- What?  No.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.275
No, we really are just going.

34:39.476 --> 34:42.446
Sorry, I didn't mean
to rush you or anything.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.547
'Cause I'm open to
talking about anything.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.818
There's nothing.  It's like, that's
just how I act in the morning.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.972
I'm sorry, we're just all ready to go
and we have this big day ahead of us,

34:50.973 --> 34:52.520
so, we should probably
get going soon.

34:52.524 --> 34:57.049
- But finish your thing and you know...
- Okay.

35:03.102 --> 35:06.703
Okay, guys.
Hairy Fairy is getting ready.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.699
She'll be ready in a minute.
Champa!

35:09.274 --> 35:11.908
- Hey, are you ready?
- Asking for some directions.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.277
- Okay, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.278
- You know how to get there?
- Yeah, it's very close.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.579
Don't forget your bag in the
room, we're not coming back.

35:56.891 --> 36:02.292
Okay everyone, roll down your windows
and let's start looking for the San Pedro.

36:02.294 --> 36:08.432
You know, it's like a huge cactus,
with huge, like, long arms.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.134
What about this one?
Yeah, that one!

36:11.136 --> 36:13.757
Pilo: Donde, weon?
Champa: Pilo, Pilo, that's not it.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.674
Yeah, there's one
that looks a lot like it.

36:17.676 --> 36:21.077
Champa: There, stop the car,
stop the car.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.946
It's not a big one, but we can ask.

36:22.948 --> 36:26.116
- I'm okay to park here?
- Yeah, it's okay.

36:32.951 --> 36:36.793
- Yes, that is it.
- Yeah.

36:36.795 --> 36:40.430
Hola!

36:40.432 --> 36:42.999
Hola!

36:43.001 --> 36:45.725
Hola.
Hola you pulpa.

37:03.077 --> 37:06.572
What did he say?
Tell him we'll pay him.

37:07.159 --> 37:09.001
He's going to take you
with some friends.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.397
Yeah, how much does he
want?   It doesn't matter.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.830
So then let's go, what the fuck
are we wasting our time for?

37:14.833 --> 37:17.262
Okay, thanks.  Whatever.
It doesn't matter.

37:17.263 --> 37:18.941
We'll find another one.
Whatever.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.306
Did he not understand that
we were going to pay him?

37:23.308 --> 37:24.107
I don't know.

37:24.108 --> 37:25.434
Some people don't care
about money, Jamie.

37:25.544 --> 37:26.810
Some people have...

37:48.215 --> 37:49.766
That's one in the back, right?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.301
That's... a big one.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.071
She's got to sell us some of
that, whoever lives here.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.773
Oh my God, that's the biggest
San Pedro I've ever seen.

37:56.775 --> 37:57.841
Man, you've seen two.

37:57.843 --> 38:00.377
They have to give us some of
that, right?  They've got so much.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.378
Hola!

38:06.740 --> 38:09.485
Senora, we want to
buy your cactus plant.

38:09.487 --> 38:10.788
We want to give you money.

38:20.812 --> 38:22.705
Ask her why she won't
even  think about it.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.069
You have so much. You're
never going to use all that.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.900
Come on, man, take it easy.
She's not going to sell.

38:27.907 --> 38:30.307
Look how much you have.

38:43.224 --> 38:47.590
Let's go, man, she's
not gonna sell it.  Yah.

38:49.127 --> 38:53.296
So close.
Champa, get it.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.800
You wanna jump the fence, man?

38:56.802 --> 38:59.502
No, it's kind of criminal, isn't it?

39:00.582 --> 39:02.739
Hey, you guys, I was just
going to say, we can't wait in

39:02.741 --> 39:04.207
front of this poor
man's house all day.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.510
- We've gotta just let it go.
- Yeah, you're right.

39:05.512 --> 39:07.482
Jamie, Jamie,
come on.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.248
Let's go get a drink.

39:22.817 --> 39:28.565
I think we should spend a
little more time looking.

39:28.567 --> 39:32.473
'Cause honestly, I expected
us to spend a lot more time

39:32.474 --> 39:35.400
than what we've spent so far looking.

39:35.474 --> 39:38.641
Yeah, but it's getting late and
we've spent so much time.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.343
I don't know if it's enough.

39:40.345 --> 39:41.711
Do you guys feel like
it's been a long time?

39:41.713 --> 39:43.646
I feel like it's, you know, only been a...

39:43.648 --> 39:46.182
I thought we would be looking
for a lot longer than this.

39:46.184 --> 39:50.390
How long is the drive to,
to Pan de Azúcar?

39:50.392 --> 39:55.125
Um, at least three hours or
something like that.

39:55.127 --> 39:57.660
Yeah, I think we should hit the
road before the sun goes down.

39:57.662 --> 39:59.306
No, hey, Crystal, you
need to stay out of it.

39:59.341 --> 40:02.399
We made this plan a long time ago.

40:02.401 --> 40:06.436
The whole part of the plan was for
us to drink San Pedro on the beach.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.772
That's really what
started this whole trip.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.607
It's kind of weird to
show up without it.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.941
Doesn't make any sense.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.612
Who here wants to go and do it?

40:15.614 --> 40:16.911
I mean...

40:23.625 --> 40:27.845
Okay, yeah, sure.
It's too bad.

40:30.535 --> 40:33.963
- We'll make another trip.
- Yeah, I'd like to, man.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.665
And, you know, if it's just the
two of us, we can search all day,

40:36.666 --> 40:39.075
we won't get tired of it...
I know you don't get tired of it.

40:51.127 --> 40:57.721
Hey, you guys.
There's a San Pedro cactus here.

40:58.590 --> 41:00.356
Oh, it is, yeah, it is.

41:00.358 --> 41:02.826
That definitely is.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.495
Wow, Crystal!
Thank you.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.163
Okay, we have to ask.
We have to ask.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.232
- You want to ask?
- Yeah, I mean, it'll take five minutes.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.500
We're here.  Come on.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.168
Hola.
Not like that, no, no, no.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.504
Yeah, I know, you're right.
Sorry, Crystal.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.738
- Hola.
- Tell her, um...

41:20.879 --> 41:24.656
We'd like to buy your cactus.  Pay
you money for your cactus.  Money.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.620
- Hola.
- Como estas, how are you...

41:30.822 --> 41:33.280
We'd love to give you some
money for your cactus.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.798
Tell her how many, like, tell her
how many people we've asked...

41:41.800 --> 41:45.223
About our day, and...
We'd be very happy.

41:45.870 --> 41:48.284
She'll have to think about it.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.009
Well, yeah.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.088
She said yes.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.448
She knows we want the plant, right?

42:04.322 --> 42:06.791
Oh, she's got so much.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.594
Hey, we won't be long here.

42:15.431 --> 42:18.601
Champa, hey, would you
just translate what I say?

42:18.603 --> 42:21.370
Tell her... you have to tell her we
just want to pay for the cactus.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.837
We don't really want to, like, hang
out here for a long time or anything.

42:23.975 --> 42:27.977
Just tell her, yeah.
Yeah, good.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.626
I don't think she
understands that, yeah,

42:29.627 --> 42:31.868
'cause the kids are impatient, just
tell her we want to buy the cactus.

42:32.851 --> 42:43.628
- Cactus...
- Um, bien.

44:21.132 --> 44:23.726
Hey, guys, let's get going.  It's
getting late.  We have to go now.

44:23.728 --> 44:24.927
Just give us a moment, Jamie.

44:24.929 --> 44:25.828
Just give us a moment, Jamie.
Jamie, settle down.

44:25.830 --> 44:26.696
Jamie, settle down.
We're in the middle of a

44:26.698 --> 44:27.363
we're in the middle of a
conversation with...

44:27.365 --> 44:29.132
Yeah, senora Pichita,
I'm very sorry...

44:29.134 --> 44:31.934
- Chelita, it's senora Chelita.
- No, come on, man.

44:32.036 --> 44:34.303
No, it's time to go.
It's just time to go, you know?

44:34.305 --> 44:35.972
I have a surprise that
I think you're gonna like.

44:35.974 --> 44:38.358
Guys, let's move fast.

44:42.547 --> 44:45.116
Hey, I think you guys
wanna see something.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.718
Take a look in the back.

44:51.590 --> 44:53.489
You're a son of a bitch, man.

44:57.395 --> 45:01.597
You crazy fucking chicken!
You're wild!

45:01.599 --> 45:03.699
- All right.
- Okay, let's get out of here.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.535
Hey, Crystal, I want you to
sit in the passenger seat.

45:05.537 --> 45:07.236
- You need to be the co-pilot.
- Oh, my God!

45:07.238 --> 45:08.786
'Cause you're the
one who saw it first.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.270
- Be the co-pilot.
- All right.

45:10.809 --> 45:13.677
Come on, guys.

45:17.382 --> 45:22.385
Ah, oh yeah.  You know, I'm thinking
we should do a little karmic cleansing.

45:22.387 --> 45:26.110
Man, I like having this
big boy between my legs.

45:28.293 --> 45:31.060
Crystal, why don't you pass
it back, you know?  Don't...

45:31.262 --> 45:33.029
It's getting me too
excited having it up here.

45:33.031 --> 45:35.943
Okay, okay, let me
just finish my blessing.

45:39.604 --> 45:41.668
Yeah, and then pass it back.

45:44.709 --> 45:47.443
Maybe we'll cook it as soon
as we get there 'cause it'll...

45:47.445 --> 45:51.047
We need to give about nine hours
to cook it, so if we do it

45:51.049 --> 45:52.815
as soon as we get there,
we can drink it tonight.

45:52.817 --> 45:55.985
Oh, I think we should cook it
today and take it tomorrow.

45:55.987 --> 45:58.721
Yeah, but it would be so nice
with the stars and the nighttime.

45:58.723 --> 46:02.024
I'm not sure if I'm taking
the San Pedro anymore.

46:02.026 --> 46:04.026
- Yeah?
- I don't feel very well...

46:04.028 --> 46:06.129
- What? Why not?
- Since I slept on the floor.

46:06.131 --> 46:07.797
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

46:07.799 --> 46:10.900
When we get there, we'll do some,
we'll do some healing work, okay?

46:10.902 --> 46:12.250
- I'll fix you right up.
- Hey, that's a good idea.

46:12.370 --> 46:14.937
You guys should
definitely do that together.

46:21.656 --> 46:26.149
Incredible.  I've never seen
anything like it, it is so beautiful.

46:26.151 --> 46:27.850
We've gotta stop and get out.

46:27.852 --> 46:29.257
I'd rather not stop right now.

46:29.292 --> 46:32.707
The only thing is we're making really
good time, and it would be nice to start

46:32.724 --> 46:34.891
cooking it before the sun goes down.

46:34.893 --> 46:37.693
We're just zooming through
this gorgeous landscape.

46:37.695 --> 46:40.497
Yeah, we're making such good time is the
only thing and we can get to the beach.

46:40.499 --> 46:42.080
No, please, just a few
minutes, plus I've gotta pee.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.133
We're gonna have to
stop anyway, I've gotta pee.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.938
I mean, there is pee literally
coming out of my vagina.

46:59.790 --> 47:04.036
- All right, guys.
- What?

47:04.323 --> 47:06.797
Let's get going now.
What are we doing?

47:09.561 --> 47:13.110
We're in this beautiful place.
Here, this is chamomile.

47:13.130 --> 47:15.914
Sniff it, this will relax you.
Wow, that's really nice.

47:15.967 --> 47:17.389
- Isn't that pretty?
- Yeah, bring it.

47:17.502 --> 47:19.247
Yeah, it kind of smells like...

47:20.505 --> 47:26.184
Boys, smell this chamomile.
Chamomile.

47:29.247 --> 47:32.612
Aye-yai-yai, that pollo loco
is driving me loco.

47:32.684 --> 47:33.883
Come on, asshole.

47:35.320 --> 47:36.686
Shut up, asshole.

47:36.688 --> 47:37.920
â™ª Pollo loco,

47:37.922 --> 47:40.723
â™ª I made a song for you. â™ª

47:40.725 --> 47:42.225
This I would watch.

47:42.227 --> 47:45.928
â™ª Oh, my pollo loco. â™ª

47:45.930 --> 47:46.629
Okay

47:46.631 --> 47:49.131
â™ª You need to leave your soul

47:49.133 --> 47:53.336
on this desert floor. â™ª

48:04.787 --> 48:09.485
â™ª The voices in my head
are shadows, shadows â™ª

48:09.487 --> 48:11.921
â™ª She comes to me to tell me

48:11.923 --> 48:13.789
â™ª what they're after â™ª

48:13.791 --> 48:15.825
â™ª says, "it ain't the end, boy,

48:15.827 --> 48:18.361
â™ª but you'd best be careful,

48:18.363 --> 48:20.263
careful â™ª

48:20.265 --> 48:21.898
â™ª might catch your tail end

48:21.900 --> 48:24.467
in a circle, circle... â™ª

48:33.179 --> 48:36.446
Yo, Jamie.
Can you help us, please?

48:51.926 --> 48:55.396
Look!  This is perfect over here.
Pilo, come over here.

48:55.399 --> 48:57.763
Guys!
Bring all the stuff over here.

48:57.769 --> 49:01.142
- It is beautiful.
- Yeah, this place is fucking perfect, man.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.802
- Let's put up the tent.
- It's beautiful here!

49:05.209 --> 49:07.357
Thank you for bringing me here.

49:07.392 --> 49:09.096
I'm gonna grab the tiny kitchen, ciao.

49:09.097 --> 49:10.842
Yeah, okay, we're gonna set up the tents.

49:13.318 --> 49:18.487
â™ª Look to the sea...

49:20.458 --> 49:21.490
Hey...

49:21.492 --> 49:25.594
- Hey...
- Hey-ya, whoo!

49:28.699 --> 49:31.921
Okay, I'm a little disappointed!

49:34.172 --> 49:35.571
â™ª Black, loving eyes,

49:35.573 --> 49:37.206
â™ª and a stare that sees

49:37.208 --> 49:38.274
for miles â™ª

49:38.276 --> 49:39.775
â™ª says she wants to,

49:39.777 --> 49:44.013
â™ª Oh, wants to stay a child... â™ª

49:54.835 --> 49:58.027
- Take this one.
- Yeah.

49:58.029 --> 49:59.994
Okay, I'm gonna go hunting, man, okay?

49:59.998 --> 50:01.263
Oh, good, yeah, okay, good.

50:01.265 --> 50:03.467
- I'll catch you some fish.
- Catch something for dinner.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.859
Okay, I'm gonna try.
See you later.

50:06.104 --> 50:07.370
Thank you.

50:11.476 --> 50:12.955
- Yo, Crystal.
- Yeah.

50:12.990 --> 50:14.639
We got a tarot reading pending, okay?

50:14.674 --> 50:17.247
- I know, I'm excited.
- Cool.

50:17.348 --> 50:19.132
I'll be waiting.

50:27.469 --> 50:30.593
- Jamie, can I help?
- Oh, that's okay.

50:30.595 --> 50:32.495
Oh, I'd like to.

50:32.497 --> 50:34.855
That's okay, I'm just taking
the thorns out right now

50:34.856 --> 50:36.483
and now I'm just
using this little knife.

50:36.518 --> 50:37.800
Yeah, look, I even have my own knife.

50:37.802 --> 50:40.386
- I'm gonna remove the skin and...
- Wonderful.

50:40.421 --> 50:42.305
I can kind of... it's kind
of a one-person job.

50:42.306 --> 50:44.862
No, look, if we move it just like this.

50:45.043 --> 50:48.063
- Now it's a two-person job.
- Yeah, perfectly.

50:48.320 --> 50:49.648
It's okay.

51:06.396 --> 51:10.066
The outer layer of it in little chunks.
That'll... that's what you want.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.977
- Like this, yeah?
- And there's still a little green left here,

51:11.978 --> 51:13.716
- so get all of that, get all of that.
- Okay, okay

51:17.675 --> 51:21.885
So, once we get this cooking, I think
we should all sit around the pot, right?

51:21.912 --> 51:23.374
We're gonna cook it in that little stove?

51:23.614 --> 51:26.804
- Yeah.
- And just have a gathering, you know,

51:26.839 --> 51:29.303
and talk about maybe
our fears, you know?

51:29.353 --> 51:30.896
- We can just sort of...
- You think that's important?

51:30.955 --> 51:32.503
Yeah, I do, I think it would be nice

51:32.504 --> 51:35.028
to have a little ceremony,
you know, in preparation.

51:35.259 --> 51:38.773
It's very important before
taking drugs as a group that

51:38.808 --> 51:41.030
everybody sort of commune
with one another, you know?

51:41.032 --> 51:42.231
- Yeah, I agree.
- Yeah.

51:42.233 --> 51:43.852
I mean, it's either that or an orgy,

51:43.853 --> 51:46.159
and I don't think you boys
are ready for that.

52:42.801 --> 52:46.580
What else do I have to show you?
Oh, this guy... I never finished her.

52:47.165 --> 52:48.321
Lel, lel!

52:51.502 --> 52:56.139
There was... my lady.
There she is.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.275
Uh, I'm gonna play futbol.

53:00.578 --> 53:03.142
Ey, oh.
Pilo.

53:10.521 --> 53:13.941
Yo, Jamie, come on.

53:22.755 --> 53:24.632
- Hola, amigo.
- Hola.

53:26.304 --> 53:29.643
- He can really play.
- Thank you.

53:58.069 --> 54:00.663
Yeah, I'm gonna check on the
San Pedro, it's almost ready.

54:01.439 --> 54:03.263
- Okay, man.
- Yeah.

54:06.277 --> 54:07.920
- Hi.
- Hey.

54:08.879 --> 54:12.083
Welcome.
Lie down, breathe.

54:20.963 --> 54:24.326
â™ª I don't want to stay
and then... â™ª

54:24.328 --> 54:28.330
So, maybe we should break
the ice with talking about,

54:28.332 --> 54:30.929
you know, maybe what
we're afraid of a little bit.

54:30.935 --> 54:35.170
I know that you're... you've got a lot of
fear surrounding taking the San Pedro.

54:35.172 --> 54:36.872
What's your biggest fear?

54:36.874 --> 54:39.842
In life, not... just in life.

54:39.844 --> 54:43.788
Really, anything, and just,
and just throw it in that fire.

54:43.881 --> 54:45.614
Extinguish it.

54:45.616 --> 54:52.218
Um, I think my main fears
are, uh, madness and,

54:52.253 --> 54:56.849
hopelessness, and then
I could say, like, cops.

54:57.995 --> 55:01.263
Cops, that's a serious one.

55:01.265 --> 55:03.933
- And Lel?
- But no English.

55:03.934 --> 55:06.860
That's okay
Speak your language.

55:15.409 --> 55:18.180
- People with bad intentions?
- Yeah.

55:18.182 --> 55:21.284
Interesting.
Okay, Champa.

55:21.385 --> 55:24.487
I just want to say thank you
guys for being so honest

55:24.488 --> 55:26.835
and vulnerable and it's beautiful.

55:27.023 --> 55:28.356
Okay, Champa.

55:28.358 --> 55:35.297
Um, I really don't, don't think
about a huge fear that I have,

55:35.298 --> 55:40.873
but if you ask me, I would
say, like, uncertainty.

55:44.238 --> 55:45.070
Pollo.

55:49.976 --> 55:53.627
So, is there any... anything
at all that the big bad pollo

55:53.628 --> 55:55.837
is afraid of that he wants to share?

55:59.051 --> 56:01.948
Yeah, I don't know, the
ocean and, like, sharks.

56:04.322 --> 56:07.486
It seems like maybe you're
just afraid of being honest,

56:07.487 --> 56:10.968
you know, and vulnerable
and, and, and opening up...

56:11.963 --> 56:15.497
Like these boys have.

56:15.499 --> 56:18.182
Yeah, I really am, actually,
just afraid of sharks, though.

56:18.535 --> 56:23.138
Like, they... I hate the idea that they
could be swimming underneath you,

56:23.139 --> 56:27.787
and you don't know, and then you're
just like, I don't know, it's really...

56:28.310 --> 56:30.334
I actually am really afraid of sharks.

56:33.415 --> 56:37.256
Crystal Fairy, so why don't
you share your fears with us?

56:38.552 --> 56:45.242
Well... You know, I guess my
biggest fear is that, that this

56:45.243 --> 56:49.700
incarnation of humans is not
gonna realize its freedom, you know?

56:49.724 --> 56:52.529
Freedom... freedom from time,

56:52.531 --> 56:57.700
from this mechanized world that
we live in.  From ego, you know?

56:57.703 --> 57:04.128
We, we have to awaken to, to our
own nature, to ourselves, you know,

57:04.129 --> 57:08.710
so we can cast aside our ego and, and,
and reconcile with the divine, you know,

57:08.712 --> 57:11.040
with earth, and, and
now is the time to do it.

57:11.047 --> 57:14.217
We've gotta, oh, we've
gotta work hard and unleash

57:14.218 --> 57:18.780
that ancient voice of consciousness
that, that now only belongs to the,

57:18.787 --> 57:21.736
to the angels and to
the fairies, you know?

57:21.924 --> 57:24.488
And it's, it's difficult,
you know, it's destructive.

57:24.592 --> 57:27.760
It's a darkness that each of us
have to pass through, you know,

57:27.762 --> 57:31.238
that the world is passing through,
the world, it's suffering so much

57:31.239 --> 57:35.900
the way that we are, but at the end,
this world will end, and it will transform

57:35.902 --> 57:40.145
and we'll be in a new world, in
or around December 21st, 2012,

57:40.146 --> 57:42.005
which is the end of the
Mayan calendar, you know,

57:42.074 --> 57:45.111
and then we will be living in a
transformed, beautiful world

57:45.112 --> 57:47.576
that is surrounded by the new sphere.

57:48.279 --> 57:51.149
I'm gonna try to
translate a little bit to Lel.

58:08.233 --> 58:10.165
Are you sure you're
translating correctly?

58:10.265 --> 58:12.336
Yeah, because you talk too much,

58:12.337 --> 58:15.805
I'm getting, like, a little
bit of what you said, but...

58:15.840 --> 58:18.104
- I just... 'cause he's laughing.
- Si, yeah.

58:18.139 --> 58:20.644
Are you laughing at me?
You're laughing at me?

58:21.175 --> 58:22.881
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

58:23.010 --> 58:23.776
No.

58:23.778 --> 58:26.240
Crystal, I have to say
you're, you are hilarious.

58:26.246 --> 58:29.127
You're such a character, I love you.

58:30.216 --> 58:34.700
You guys, this is serious.
It's up to us.  This is serious.

58:34.701 --> 58:38.504
It's... 2012 is around the corner!

01:00:15.018 --> 01:00:18.442
<i>Pollo!
Good morning.</i>

01:00:18.444 --> 01:00:19.543
Morning.

01:00:19.545 --> 01:00:23.161
- Come do my magical passes with me!
- Okay.

01:00:24.616 --> 01:00:26.883
Oh, my God, look at your face.
You look like a crab.

01:00:26.885 --> 01:00:29.436
Yeah, I got a little sunburn.
Here, you don't want that.

01:00:33.301 --> 01:00:37.524
So we're gonna start with right
arm up, left leg up.

01:00:37.526 --> 01:00:39.193
Okay, and vigorous breath.

01:00:39.195 --> 01:00:40.661
And...

01:00:44.299 --> 01:00:47.608
Ideally, you have snot pouring
out of your nose, you know?

01:00:48.136 --> 01:00:50.880
That's good.
Put a little force into it.

01:00:51.873 --> 01:00:55.300
Kind of like yoga?
Or something?

01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:57.238
Similar, similar.

01:00:58.646 --> 01:01:00.244
Hey, crystal.

01:01:00.246 --> 01:01:03.276
Maybe you just finish your magical
passes and I'll wake the guys up.

01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:06.717
Jamie, remember yesterday
how we talked about just letting

01:01:06.719 --> 01:01:09.853
things unfold in their own time
and not rushing or forcing them?

01:01:09.855 --> 01:01:11.288
Yeah, Crystal, I'm
not rushing anything.

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:13.323
Don't be so patronizing, you know?
I'm just...

01:01:13.325 --> 01:01:14.858
I'm not rushing it.
We didn't do it last night,

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.826
we're doing it today,
so it's not really rushing it.

01:01:16.828 --> 01:01:18.691
I think you should just let
the boys get their rest.

01:01:18.696 --> 01:01:21.785
Well, I think we should do it first
thing in the morning, you know?

01:01:21.966 --> 01:01:24.879
Maybe you should put
some sunblock on today.

01:01:43.523 --> 01:01:45.590
Yeah, more, more, more.

01:01:58.736 --> 01:02:01.228
Oh, yeah, it looks good.

01:02:01.267 --> 01:02:03.099
This is good.

01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:08.941
- Boys, your breakfast is ready!
- No, we're not supposed to eat!

01:02:08.974 --> 01:02:11.771
Hey, Champa, your brother
said it is better to fast.

01:02:13.044 --> 01:02:14.775
We're supposed to be fasting.

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:16.278
Guys.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.979
Don't eat that!

01:02:17.981 --> 01:02:19.142
Come on!

01:02:19.415 --> 01:02:20.944
We're supposed to
have empty stomachs.

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:22.760
- It's easier to digest...
- They are hungry.

01:02:22.852 --> 01:02:26.279
I had a nice big plate of food
this morning.  I feel great.

01:02:30.192 --> 01:02:32.525
Okay, I'm not eating and

01:02:32.527 --> 01:02:34.298
I'm gonna go and
drink over there because

01:02:34.299 --> 01:02:37.490
I don't think we should be near the kitchen
stuff in case people start throwing up,

01:02:37.498 --> 01:02:40.875
which now you guys
are probably going to.

01:02:41.034 --> 01:02:42.567
Come over here when you're ready.

01:02:55.741 --> 01:02:57.380
You boys, you don't worry about him.

01:02:57.382 --> 01:02:59.181
You just enjoy your breakfast, yeah?

01:03:19.033 --> 01:03:20.734
Well, guys, I just want to
say I'm really happy we're all...

01:03:20.736 --> 01:03:22.496
Oh, we need our magical pebbles!

01:03:22.504 --> 01:03:24.338
We need our good energy
pebbles, our crystals.

01:03:24.339 --> 01:03:25.933
Does everybody have them?

01:03:27.941 --> 01:03:28.707
Yeah?

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:30.880
I didn't keep mine.

01:03:31.345 --> 01:03:34.630
Okay, well, I will find
you another one.

01:03:42.972 --> 01:03:45.482
- Cheers, my friend.
- Cheers, amigo.

01:03:52.107 --> 01:03:54.377
- Strong flavor.
- Strong.

01:03:57.335 --> 01:03:58.468
I think I'm going to wait for the...

01:03:58.469 --> 01:03:59.950
Hey, wait, what are you doing?

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:02.015
- You started drinking it without us?
- Mmm.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.685
Yeah, it's got a really interesting...

01:04:08.577 --> 01:04:11.000
Yeah, I don't think
I really need this, Crystal.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:12.580
I don't think I need it.

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:14.511
Yah, Jamie, Pilo.
Cheers.

01:04:31.306 --> 01:04:34.948
- Very bad?
- Here you go, Crystal.

01:04:34.983 --> 01:04:36.510
Gracias.

01:04:44.304 --> 01:04:45.184
Whoo!

01:04:49.279 --> 01:04:50.112
Pilo.

01:04:53.017 --> 01:04:58.550
Yeah, no, I still have, like,
a headache, I'm not sure.

01:04:58.554 --> 01:04:59.420
Ya po loco, go!

01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:02.003
Oh, the headache won't be
a problem.  This will probably...

01:05:03.972 --> 01:05:06.820
Why don't we do a little healing
together as you take it?

01:05:06.828 --> 01:05:09.527
That will help.
That will soothe you.

01:05:10.564 --> 01:05:12.173
Yeah, do like, a healing thing.

01:05:12.567 --> 01:05:16.265
Okay, uh, yeah, I want you
to actually sit facing the east.

01:05:16.437 --> 01:05:18.632
- Okay.
- I don't think it has anything...

01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:23.486
We're going to do a little energy work,
yeah, just to get ourselves straight here.

01:05:23.676 --> 01:05:26.886
And breathe in...

01:05:29.181 --> 01:05:30.728
And that's right.

01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:33.961
It's a good time to start drinking it...

01:05:35.653 --> 01:05:36.681
Mmm.

01:05:38.489 --> 01:05:39.989
Very good.

01:05:40.424 --> 01:05:42.080
Okay

01:05:44.328 --> 01:05:45.894
It's very toxic...

01:05:45.896 --> 01:05:46.595
Hey.

01:05:46.597 --> 01:05:47.612
What did you think?

01:06:15.825 --> 01:06:17.582
- What, her?
- Yeah.

01:06:17.657 --> 01:06:18.861
San Pedro?

01:06:19.291 --> 01:06:23.633
It's definitely not, no.
The onset is like, 120 minutes.

01:06:24.796 --> 01:06:28.641
Do you guys see those faces in
those rocks?  Those smiling faces?

01:06:30.234 --> 01:06:31.400
What faces?

01:06:31.435 --> 01:06:35.354
There's a family of smiling
faces right up on that Ridge.

01:06:35.371 --> 01:06:36.895
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.173 --> 01:06:39.005
Where exactly, where
specifically are they?

01:06:39.008 --> 01:06:41.246
- Right up at the, starting at the...
- Are you kidding?

01:06:41.277 --> 01:06:42.847
There are no faces in the mountains.

01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:45.045
No, I think I see some.

01:06:45.047 --> 01:06:47.315
No, it hasn't hit yet.
You're just pretending.

01:06:47.316 --> 01:06:48.813
You don't need to like... Crystal.

01:06:49.151 --> 01:06:51.685
Like, just enjoy the beauty of it,
you know.  They're just mountains.

01:06:51.686 --> 01:06:53.185
Like, just enjoy what they are.

01:06:53.187 --> 01:06:56.599
You don't have to like, imagine
that there's something there,
because there isn't, you know.

01:06:56.624 --> 01:06:59.643
Like, I don't need a rock in my cup
when I'm drinking this stuff either.

01:06:59.693 --> 01:07:01.669
- Like, all of this stuff...
- All right, Jamie, okay, it's fine.

01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:04.950
...Not really necessary.
Be real, you know?

01:07:04.965 --> 01:07:07.763
- I mean, it hasn't hit you yet.
- Seems like...

01:07:08.867 --> 01:07:13.015
Maybe, you need to be alone
or something.  I don't know.

01:07:13.072 --> 01:07:18.061
I'm gonna go hang out with those rocks.
I'll see you guys later.

01:07:19.844 --> 01:07:21.410
Come on, don't be an asshole, man.
You know it's...

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.970
I'm not being... I'm being an
asshole now? I'm just saying like...

01:07:24.014 --> 01:07:26.680
Yeah, it's Crystal Fairy, man.
You know her, you know that's...

01:07:26.683 --> 01:07:27.682
I'm not being an asshole.

01:07:27.684 --> 01:07:31.319
I'm just saying she doesn't have to do
all that stuff that she's constantly doing.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.217
Yeah, but maybe you
were too honest, you know?

01:07:34.223 --> 01:07:36.429
Besides, it's not necessary to
say that to her in that way...

01:07:36.464 --> 01:07:37.850
Somebody needs to say that to her.

01:07:37.859 --> 01:07:39.826
She's obviously never
heard that in her whole life.

01:07:39.961 --> 01:07:42.923
I'm, you know, I'm just
trying to tell her how it is.

01:07:42.998 --> 01:07:44.028
Okay.

01:07:44.932 --> 01:07:49.282
What do you think if we go to
explore the area?  Over these rocks?

01:07:49.336 --> 01:07:51.425
It's an amazing place.

01:07:52.205 --> 01:07:53.265
Yeah.

01:08:33.198 --> 01:08:38.542
You guys, you think I was
really an asshole... to Crystal?

01:08:39.613 --> 01:08:41.089
I don't know, you made me feel... ah!

01:08:41.515 --> 01:08:44.822
You gave me so much grief
after we had that weird moment.

01:08:44.984 --> 01:08:48.274
Like you gave me so much grief about it.
Do you think she's okay?

01:08:48.354 --> 01:08:49.662
Just forget about it, man.

01:08:49.721 --> 01:08:51.828
Just relax, it was nothing, okay?

01:08:51.857 --> 01:08:55.158
I can't stop thinking of it because
you gave me so much grief, you know.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.651
I just... I feel like it was
too much or something.

01:08:59.296 --> 01:09:03.116
- No, just relax, man.
- I am. What do you mean?

01:09:03.466 --> 01:09:04.566
I am.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:13.626
- I don't think...
-  What's wrong, man?

01:09:18.913 --> 01:09:19.796
Yo.

01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:23.171
- I don't think it's hitting me very well.
- What?

01:09:23.184 --> 01:09:24.800
- Wait, wait.
- What's wrong, man?

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:26.518
Wait, wait.

01:09:32.474 --> 01:09:35.246
- Okay, I'm a little better.
- Yeah, you are, man.

01:09:35.281 --> 01:09:36.304
Yeah.

01:09:39.432 --> 01:09:42.229
Huh?  What'd you say?
You said something about me?

01:09:42.868 --> 01:09:44.368
- No, don't worry.
- Just tell me!

01:09:44.837 --> 01:09:48.100
- I need to know.
- Lel thinks you are little bit pale.

01:09:49.107 --> 01:09:52.316
Don't laugh right now!
Don't laugh right now.

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:54.139
Don't laugh at me.

01:09:55.747 --> 01:09:56.931
Come on.

01:10:00.717 --> 01:10:01.679
Ahh.

01:10:02.452 --> 01:10:04.709
Oh, my voice sounds so weird.

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:10.419
Okay, man, just relax.
Breathe. Breathe slowly.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.692
Okay?

01:10:25.545 --> 01:10:26.637
Wait for me!
Wait, wait.

01:10:27.608 --> 01:10:28.941
Ahh!

01:10:29.242 --> 01:10:30.844
Oh, my voice sounds weird, right?

01:10:31.077 --> 01:10:32.289
Ahh!

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:34.228
Ahm!

01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:35.801
Mahm!

01:10:38.817 --> 01:10:39.701
Ahh!

01:10:42.053 --> 01:10:43.101
Oh!

01:10:43.388 --> 01:10:44.895
Oh, mah!

01:10:46.957 --> 01:10:48.090
It's weird.

01:10:48.092 --> 01:10:49.224
It's really...

01:10:49.226 --> 01:10:50.195
Ahh.

01:10:52.629 --> 01:10:55.814
Yo, Jamie, what the situation, Jamie?

01:10:56.233 --> 01:10:58.075
Yeah, that's right, man.

01:10:58.601 --> 01:10:59.766
Um!

01:10:59.768 --> 01:11:02.251
Come on.
What the situation, man?

01:11:02.638 --> 01:11:04.571
Why are you acting like that?

01:11:04.807 --> 01:11:07.600
Why are you being so strange?
You're acting so strange.

01:11:07.609 --> 01:11:10.289
Everything is fine, man.
Everything is so fine, it's all right.

01:11:10.611 --> 01:11:13.780
My little brothers is nice
people.  Me too. Okay.

01:11:13.781 --> 01:11:15.980
Why are you being so strange?

01:11:15.982 --> 01:11:18.492
What the situation, man, come on.

01:11:19.119 --> 01:11:22.444
Come here, man.
Come here, hey.

01:11:23.956 --> 01:11:26.123
Let's go to the sea, man.
You want to go to the sea?

01:11:26.192 --> 01:11:27.057
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:11:27.092 --> 01:11:29.061
Let's go in the water, yeah.
Let's go in the water.

01:11:29.862 --> 01:11:31.040
No, let's go in the water right now.

01:11:31.096 --> 01:11:33.131
- Come on, lazy wog.
- Let's go right now.

01:11:33.198 --> 01:11:35.090
- Come on, botota.
- Botota!

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.600
Botota, man!
Oh, what's the situation?

01:11:37.602 --> 01:11:39.872
- Such a fucking baby.
- Oh, it's so hot.

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:41.508
Oh, please, let's go in the water.

01:11:41.939 --> 01:11:44.589
Yes.
I like that idea.

01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:55.408
<i>â™ª if you're feeling fancy free â™ª</i>

01:11:56.251 --> 01:12:01.125
â™ª come wander through the world with me â™ª

01:12:01.555 --> 01:12:11.894
â™ª And any place we chance to be

â™ª Two for the road,

01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:23.573
â™ª collecting precious memories â™ª

01:12:23.575 --> 01:12:28.925
â™ª Selecting souvenirs

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:07.105
â™ª Long... Long while â™ª

01:14:07.198 --> 01:14:11.335
Hey, guys, I think I'm...
starting to feel the mescaline!

01:14:13.104 --> 01:14:16.044
Are you guys feeling it?

01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:42.160
Oh, my God, where did you
come from?

01:14:42.162 --> 01:14:45.262
Oh.

01:14:45.264 --> 01:14:48.733
Oh.

01:15:29.417 --> 01:15:31.554
You guys all look so much alike.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:38.167
Genes are so weird.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:04.325
It's a monster.

01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:06.672
Monster.

01:18:28.286 --> 01:18:31.625
Fossiled whales in the desert
from seven million years ago.

01:18:31.628 --> 01:18:35.216
- What kind of whales?
- Rorquals.  Orca whales.

01:18:35.899 --> 01:18:36.998
For the most part.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.002
- Sir, this is my brother Pilo.
- Pilo.

01:18:40.536 --> 01:18:41.468
Hola, Pilo.

01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:44.784
They are whale experts.
They're researching whales here.

01:18:44.841 --> 01:18:46.114
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:18:46.209 --> 01:18:47.640
What are you guys doing here?

01:18:47.642 --> 01:18:52.799
We are studying the ancient life
from seven million years ago.

01:18:53.148 --> 01:18:56.232
They get preserved in the
desert and we find them.

01:19:04.837 --> 01:19:06.906
Champa!

01:19:09.295 --> 01:19:10.994
Why does that look so weird?

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:13.006
It's really creeping
me out right now.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:15.297
Let's go look at those pelicans.

01:19:17.501 --> 01:19:21.539
- What were you doing?
- I was talking to these guys.

01:19:22.039 --> 01:19:23.806
...They leave a record.

01:19:23.808 --> 01:19:26.508
And that's what we do,
is find that record and figure...

01:19:53.403 --> 01:19:54.794
Come on.

01:20:28.342 --> 01:20:31.537
No, I like the one with his neck
like... he's got his neck back there.

01:20:31.566 --> 01:20:32.766
Yeah, it's like this.

01:20:32.768 --> 01:20:35.334
What is this stuff that
I'm sitting beside?

01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:36.435
That?

01:20:36.437 --> 01:20:37.970
A net...

01:20:38.472 --> 01:20:40.370
There's little knots in here, huh?

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:42.772
- Oh, I'm stuck in it.
- Jamie...

01:20:44.177 --> 01:20:45.443
No, no, no, don't, don't.

01:20:45.445 --> 01:20:47.051
Jamie a fish.

01:20:47.714 --> 01:20:49.764
- A fucking fish.
- What is this place?

01:20:51.417 --> 01:20:54.825
Like, there's a sock there.
Whose sock is that?

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.830
Look at that fish.
That is really weird.

01:20:56.855 --> 01:21:00.107
What do they do here?  Do they, like,
catch fish here or what do they do?

01:21:00.258 --> 01:21:02.461
That's the grave of Tom Jones, look.

01:21:02.794 --> 01:21:04.560
- Creeping me out.
- Tom Jones's grave.

01:21:04.562 --> 01:21:07.496
Where is, uh, the
Hairy Fairy right now?

01:21:07.531 --> 01:21:08.563
Oh, I don't have no idea.

01:21:08.665 --> 01:21:10.548
I kind of actually want
to see her right now.

01:21:11.435 --> 01:21:13.447
I really want to look
in her eyes right now.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:17.230
- Yeah?
- Sad, sad.

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:18.600
- Sad?
- Yeah.

01:21:18.635 --> 01:21:20.257
I guess I should apologize to her.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:22.987
- That would be nice.
- I didn't wanna make her sad.

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:24.846
I'm gonna go find her.

01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:27.683
I'll go find her and then
I'll come find you guys.

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:29.182
- Yeah.
- Okay

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.979
- Okay, I'll see you later, man.
- See you.

01:21:31.084 --> 01:21:32.618
Good luck.

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:40.964
Crystal?

01:22:16.987 --> 01:22:21.747
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

01:22:26.912 --> 01:22:28.896
Oh, Crystal.

01:22:40.199 --> 01:22:42.048
Are you kidding me?

01:22:45.238 --> 01:22:47.314
Oh...
What?

01:22:49.211 --> 01:22:50.501
What?

01:23:31.357 --> 01:23:34.220
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:23:52.888 --> 01:23:54.041
- Yo.
- Lel.

01:24:05.236 --> 01:24:09.746
Jamie!
Jamie!

01:24:11.291 --> 01:24:12.757
Get out of there!

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.940
Hey.

01:24:29.554 --> 01:24:30.572
Jamie.

01:24:30.874 --> 01:24:32.900
Pilo, I was looking
for Crystal Fairy.

01:24:32.906 --> 01:24:34.097
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:24:34.132 --> 01:24:36.837
I was looking for her because
I haven't seen her all morning.

01:24:37.047 --> 01:24:39.147
You cannot drive, man.

01:25:38.803 --> 01:25:43.881
- Hola.
- Hola.

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:50.654
Hi.  I guess you're American, too.

01:25:50.811 --> 01:25:56.755
Well, uh, I don't know how I got a
shirt, but... I think you might need it.

01:25:57.450 --> 01:25:59.550
- Yeah, I lost my clothes!
- And I don't wanna look at you

01:25:59.552 --> 01:26:01.964
- because this is insane.
- I don't know when.

01:26:04.723 --> 01:26:06.189
What are you doing here?

01:26:06.191 --> 01:26:08.883
I'm, I'm trying to
get back to the beach.

01:26:08.994 --> 01:26:12.232
I'll give you a lift.
I've got room.

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:14.930
That'd be great, thank you.

01:26:14.932 --> 01:26:18.074
That'd be really nice of you.

01:26:20.837 --> 01:26:25.036
- So, what is your name?
- Isabel.

01:26:25.342 --> 01:26:28.242
Nice to meet you, Isabel.

01:26:28.244 --> 01:26:31.190
Have you seen Crystal or...  she
hasn't been around here, right?

01:26:31.247 --> 01:26:32.346
No.

01:26:32.348 --> 01:26:36.215
No, 'cause I, like, the last time
I saw her was this morning.

01:26:36.217 --> 01:26:39.340
Yeah, we too, but there's
no problem, I think she was...

01:26:39.353 --> 01:26:40.541
- It's okay?
- Yeah.

01:26:40.576 --> 01:26:43.280
I just want to make sure she knows how
to get back here 'cause it's cold and...

01:26:43.290 --> 01:26:43.955
Yeah, it's kind of cold.

01:26:43.957 --> 01:26:45.523
It's starting to... sun's
starting to go down.

01:26:45.525 --> 01:26:47.411
Yeah, but take it easy, man.
Stay calm, sit down.

01:26:47.694 --> 01:26:50.423
I feel good.  I think it's
starting to come down a bit.

01:26:50.429 --> 01:26:54.803
- Yeah, we're landing.
- We're landing. Yeah.

01:26:57.435 --> 01:26:59.663
- From a famous artist.
- Oh, yeah?

01:27:06.677 --> 01:27:08.760
There she is!
Crystal!

01:27:09.413 --> 01:27:13.615
Oh, wow.  Whoa.  Oh, my God,
what happened to your clothes?

01:27:13.616 --> 01:27:15.815
- I was so worried about you.
- You were?

01:27:15.818 --> 01:27:18.920
I was looking all over.  Crystal,
I really need to say I'm sorry.

01:27:19.955 --> 01:27:20.687
I'm sorry.

01:27:22.824 --> 01:27:24.624
â™ª Everybody wants

01:27:24.626 --> 01:27:28.327
â™ª safety (Safety and love)

01:27:28.329 --> 01:27:30.529
â™ª we all do.

01:27:30.531 --> 01:27:31.196
Boys.

01:27:31.198 --> 01:27:32.998
- How are you?
- Hi.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.566
- Are you cold?
- Fine... yes, I'm freezing.

01:27:35.568 --> 01:27:37.568
- We're really sorry.
- I'm okay

01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:39.846
I'm sorry, I'm sorry for being...

01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:44.941
- Are you hungry?
- I'm starving.

01:27:44.943 --> 01:27:47.311
Oh...
Where's the bonfire?

01:27:47.313 --> 01:27:49.613
What are you guys doing?

01:27:49.615 --> 01:27:53.115
- Cookies, I want cookies.
- They're so good.

01:27:56.454 --> 01:28:00.287
Yeah, Crystal was
my accomplice today.

01:28:00.924 --> 01:28:01.623
<i>Accomplice today.
She helped me.</i>

01:28:01.625 --> 01:28:05.302
- Really, you...
- No! You're giving me away?

01:28:05.561 --> 01:28:08.313
I look at here, at his eyes, and...

01:28:09.332 --> 01:28:12.330
Oh, you know, that's okay, man,
you gotta be ready for it.

01:28:12.334 --> 01:28:13.960
You can't take it if
you're not ready for it.

01:28:13.969 --> 01:28:16.996
- It was so obvious.
- Yeah, but you are...

01:28:18.939 --> 01:28:20.908
You had a good time.

01:28:22.077 --> 01:28:27.214
I remember when I was 12 years old,
I was obsessed with a girl, and I called

01:28:27.247 --> 01:28:30.810
her house, like, eight times in
one day, and they had call I.D.

01:28:30.818 --> 01:28:32.914
And her mother saw that
I called that many times.

01:28:32.949 --> 01:28:33.984
And call the police.

01:28:33.986 --> 01:28:37.026
No, she answered the phone
one time when I called,

01:28:37.061 --> 01:28:39.677
and she went, "Jamie, how many
times did you call here today?"

01:28:40.325 --> 01:28:43.660
And I was so scared in the moment,
I didn't expect her to answer

01:28:43.661 --> 01:28:46.931
or for her to be mad at me about it, and I made up this lie,

01:28:47.097 --> 01:28:51.847
I made up a lie in one second, so
I said, "oh, hey, um, hey, Donna.

01:28:51.882 --> 01:28:56.208
My, uh, the problem was
that my Internet connection

01:28:56.243 --> 01:28:57.470
had the wrong phone number in it.

01:28:57.473 --> 01:28:59.590
It accidentally had your phone
number, and I was trying to

01:28:59.598 --> 01:29:02.138
connect to the internet all day.
I kept hitting connect,

01:29:02.139 --> 01:29:05.380
and it kept calling your house.
It was a stupid mistake.

01:29:05.981 --> 01:29:08.991
When I was 17, I went to
this Halloween party.

01:29:11.152 --> 01:29:13.533
I was dressed as a mechanic.

01:29:16.857 --> 01:29:20.323
I went with this guy.
I barely knew him.

01:29:20.694 --> 01:29:25.260
We'd gone on, like, one date.
I didn't even really like him.

01:29:25.864 --> 01:29:30.630
But I was bored and I was
lonely, so I went with him,

01:29:30.636 --> 01:29:33.557
and it was at, it was
at this girl's house.

01:29:34.305 --> 01:29:39.439
She is really rich.
It was this huge pool party.

01:29:41.578 --> 01:29:44.379
And we drank a lot.
I drank a lot.

01:29:45.949 --> 01:29:49.171
And at some point I took a pill.
I thought it was ecstasy.

01:29:49.184 --> 01:29:51.493
I didn't even really
know what that was.

01:29:54.624 --> 01:29:57.457
And then...

01:29:57.559 --> 01:30:00.026
This guy who had invited me was,

01:30:00.028 --> 01:30:03.873
he wanted to take
me to the pool house.

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:08.000
I didn't really understand
what was going on.

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:10.136
I remember...

01:30:11.038 --> 01:30:15.863
Being pressed up against this window
and seeing the whole party kind of...

01:30:15.978 --> 01:30:26.528
happening, and feeling
really... scared.

01:30:27.185 --> 01:30:34.428
And then there were... two more guys
in there, and I was completely naked.

01:30:37.127 --> 01:30:42.447
And they were...
having sex with me.

01:30:43.065 --> 01:30:45.585
I mean, they were raping me.

01:30:51.231 --> 01:30:55.527
I could see this whole party happening
on the other side of the window.

01:30:57.145 --> 01:30:58.841
And...

01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:10.203
Anyway, the next thing I remembered
was that I was in this... bathtub.

01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:22.688
Waking up in this awful, warm pool of
water and the sun was rising, and it was...

01:31:41.913 --> 01:31:45.332
But I had never...
I...

01:31:48.755 --> 01:31:53.024
I know it's kind of crazy, but I
haven't actually told this story

01:31:53.026 --> 01:31:56.027
and I've never told this story.

01:31:56.029 --> 01:32:00.083
Okay, easy.
You're with us now, you're okay.

01:32:02.334 --> 01:32:08.870
You have all our support and... okay?
We love you.

01:32:08.873 --> 01:32:11.668
Thank you.
I love you.

01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:14.538
Thank you, I love you guys.

01:32:17.714 --> 01:32:21.226
Oh, my God, we made the...
Wait a minute.

01:32:22.252 --> 01:32:24.752
We made the pollo cry.

01:32:26.756 --> 01:32:29.089
My friend.

01:32:32.027 --> 01:32:36.523
Oh, my... we made the pollo cry.

01:32:38.433 --> 01:32:40.198
My friend.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.221
Come on, this is
Crystal Fairy's time, man.

01:32:44.371 --> 01:32:46.829
Don't take her opportunity, man.

01:32:47.941 --> 01:32:49.847
What the fuck?

01:32:51.711 --> 01:32:53.659
- Nah, it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:32:59.151 --> 01:33:01.615
It's okay.
We're getting emotional.

01:33:03.754 --> 01:33:06.137
It's okay

01:33:07.091 --> 01:33:08.557
It's actually...

01:33:08.559 --> 01:33:10.681
Do you have any more secrets?

01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:15.330
Oh, yeah, I do.

01:33:15.332 --> 01:33:20.796
Actually...
I'm a dominatrix.

01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:27.183
I'm a dominatrix.

01:33:30.078 --> 01:33:32.188
What is a dominatrix?

01:33:34.448 --> 01:33:39.650
Dominatrix is a woman who,
uh, straps on a black dildo and

01:33:39.653 --> 01:33:42.752
has sex with a man
who's sitting in a swing.

01:33:43.289 --> 01:33:44.254
Oh, my...

01:33:45.057 --> 01:33:46.456
Oh, my God, you saw my...?

01:33:47.326 --> 01:33:49.390
- You saw my pictures?
- I'm sorry.

01:33:49.394 --> 01:33:50.760
Oh, my God, did you see the...

01:33:50.762 --> 01:33:52.927
I had a surprise for you in there?

01:33:52.964 --> 01:33:55.499
No, I didn't see anything.
I didn't see any surprise.

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.599
What surprise?

01:33:59.836 --> 01:34:03.400
- Can we see?
- No, no, no.  No.

01:34:03.407 --> 01:34:05.905
I love you guys.

01:34:07.977 --> 01:34:09.310
- I'm gonna go to bed.
- We love you, too.

01:34:10.313 --> 01:34:11.345
We love you, too.

01:34:11.347 --> 01:34:16.257
- Can I sleep in your tent?
- Please.  Please do.

01:34:16.284 --> 01:34:19.386
Thank you.

01:34:33.975 --> 01:34:36.597
She didn't see any faces in
the Mountain.

01:34:37.673 --> 01:34:39.773
â™ª Maybe reaching for

01:34:39.775 --> 01:34:42.976
â™ª heaven and stuck on the earth

01:34:42.978 --> 01:34:46.054
â™ª will do.

01:35:47.507 --> 01:35:49.188
Crystal!

01:36:49.718 --> 01:36:53.907
â™ª And as you eat
â™ª don't think of the

01:36:53.909 --> 01:36:56.309
â™ª one you love â™ª

01:36:56.311 --> 01:36:59.679
â™ª and on the street

01:36:59.681 --> 01:37:02.816
â™ª don't look at the sky above

01:37:02.818 --> 01:37:05.285
â™ª if there's no one home,

01:37:05.287 --> 01:37:08.688
â™ª don't expect nothing â™ª

01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:12.392
â™ª 'cause nobody wants a lonely

01:37:12.394 --> 01:37:16.029
â™ª heart. â™ª
