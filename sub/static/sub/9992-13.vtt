WEBVTT

00:10.586 --> 00:11.484
Are you all right?

00:14.178 --> 00:15.929
I'm kind of a nervous flier.

00:17.373 --> 00:18.458
I sensed that.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.611
Can I tell you a few things?

00:21.954 --> 00:23.087
Might calm you down a bit.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.623
I used to be a flight attendant.

00:26.128 --> 00:28.713
When you're up here-- 35,000 feet--

00:28.985 --> 00:32.328
it's, like, the safest place you can be.

00:32.794 --> 00:34.147
It's safer than in your car.

00:34.652 --> 00:36.123
Safer than in your bathroom.

00:37.002 --> 00:38.811
Yeah, I know that.

00:39.890 --> 00:40.894
You're talking logic.

00:41.853 --> 00:44.929
And what's in my head has nothing to do with logic.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.627
- It's nothing.
- I hate that.

00:51.278 --> 00:53.976
It's air. It's like a bump in the air.

00:54.289 --> 00:56.387
Like a boat going over a small wave.

00:56.617 --> 00:57.581
You want that.

00:57.842 --> 00:59.342
You want air under the wings.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.755
There's that logic again.

01:01.251 --> 01:03.828
Folks, I've just been informed by air traffic control

01:03.883 --> 01:07.520
that we're flying into some nasty weather and to expect some pretty good chop,

01:07.769 --> 01:11.153
so I'm flipping on the fasten seat belt sign and

01:11.430 --> 01:14.405
at this time, I'd like to ask our flight attendants to take their seats as well.

01:14.462 --> 01:15.137
Oh, boy.

01:20.237 --> 01:23.053
It's going to be okay. I promise you.

01:27.476 --> 01:31.450
I don't understand. Why can't he fly around it, or above it?

01:32.604 --> 01:33.392
Oh, God!

01:34.707 --> 01:36.585
Now I'm going to tell you a secret.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.593
Nothing's going to happen.

01:38.876 --> 01:40.379
Nothing can happen.

01:40.652 --> 01:41.654
I know it.

01:41.885 --> 01:43.078
I'm certain of it.

01:43.154 --> 01:44.158
What are you talking about?

01:44.368 --> 01:47.087
- How do you know that?
- I'm four months pregnant.

01:47.736 --> 01:51.055
I can't be hurt. I'm invulnerable.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074

02:02.008 --> 02:05.539
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.511
Wow. I can hear your heart beating from over here.

02:11.345 --> 02:13.404
So what's playing tonight, World War III?

02:13.523 --> 02:14.284
No.

02:14.920 --> 02:19.992
Unstoppable microbes spreading disease throughout the world and killing entire populations?

02:20.137 --> 02:20.889
No.

02:21.124 --> 02:22.999
The Yankees back in the pennant race?

02:24.125 --> 02:26.373
It was an airplane crash. It was horrible.

02:26.973 --> 02:27.872
Sorry.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.501
Did you actually see it go down?

02:30.699 --> 02:32.849
No, I woke up just before it.

02:34.048 --> 02:35.281
Well then, maybe...

02:36.419 --> 02:37.370
Maybe.

02:38.983 --> 02:41.404
Do you think you can sleep some more, or do you want to get up?

02:41.486 --> 02:42.388
I don't know.

02:43.104 --> 02:46.582
Just... I don't know, hold me for a second.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.598
Can I tell you something that might calm you down?

02:57.876 --> 03:01.076
When you're up there-- 35,000 feet-- it's, like, the safest place you can be.

03:01.281 --> 03:04.215
It's safer than in your car, safer than in your bathroom.

03:05.566 --> 03:09.002
Don't take this personally, but could you maybe not say anything?

03:11.281 --> 03:12.269
Okay.

03:57.109 --> 03:59.164
Up and at 'em. Rise and shine.

03:59.496 --> 04:01.808
I smell delicious cold cereal.

04:02.229 --> 04:04.043
Boy, you don't want to be late for that.

04:07.550 --> 04:08.350
Where's Mommy?

04:09.420 --> 04:11.533
Oh, the D.A. called. Something's going on.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.791
He needed Mommy to come into work early this morning.

04:15.093 --> 04:16.709
Do you want me to wake up Marie?

04:16.815 --> 04:18.426
No, no, no, you let her sleep.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.446
So what'll it be? I'm cooking Pebbles, Loops or Puffs.

04:21.507 --> 04:22.249
Puffs.

04:22.490 --> 04:25.091
You're in luck. I got a batch coming out of the oven right now.

04:25.696 --> 04:27.463
- Morning Daddy!
- Morning, Bridge.

04:30.094 --> 04:32.291
So, uh, what's that you got on your head there?

04:32.725 --> 04:35.977
That's her new bicycle helmet. Mommy bought it for her yesterday.

04:36.059 --> 04:37.262
She slept in it.

04:37.539 --> 04:39.673
- Pebbles, Loops or Puffs?
- Loops.

04:39.744 --> 04:42.991
- Don't I look cool?
- Yeah, absolutely. The coolest.

04:43.309 --> 04:46.546
But, you know, normally, we don't eat, or for that matter, sleep

04:46.575 --> 04:49.947
with our hats, and especially our bicycle helmets on.

04:50.304 --> 04:52.034
You want me to help you get it off?

04:52.186 --> 04:54.833
- Daddy...
- Okay. Got it. Fine.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.682
Keep the helmet on for breakfast.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.621
But I mean, it's not like you're going to go to school in it.

05:03.017 --> 05:04.792
You want milk on those Loops?

05:07.065 --> 05:09.564
His wife's been missing going on 72 hours.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.898
Comes home from work, no note.

05:12.457 --> 05:15.053
Her car's not there, but nothing from the home seems to be missing.

05:15.099 --> 05:19.558
No luggage, no clothing. Her toiletries and medications are where she always keeps them.

05:19.604 --> 05:21.437
It's not like she packed for a trip or anything.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.505
I think I heard him on the radio just now, driving over here.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.343
He was pleading for her to come home.

05:26.399 --> 05:29.071
- He... He sounded frantic.
- I think he is.

05:29.436 --> 05:30.495
We  think he is.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.631
His alibi is airtight.

05:32.824 --> 05:34.644
He left the house for work at 4:00.

05:34.939 --> 05:39.184
Two separate neighbors have come forward to say they saw the wife leave the house around 5:15.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.500
So what am I doing here?

05:40.730 --> 05:42.260
What can I say? I'm an old dog.

05:42.536 --> 05:44.760
Whenever one of these disappearing wife situations comes up,

05:44.806 --> 05:47.355
I feel like a fool if I don't suspect the husband.

05:47.453 --> 05:48.180
But...?

05:49.132 --> 05:52.040
But, frankly, I can't find a single reason to doubt this guy's story.

05:52.763 --> 05:54.456
But you were hoping maybe I would?

05:55.655 --> 05:57.625
Well, we were hoping that you would sit with him.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.945
Give us the benefit of your opinion.

06:00.099 --> 06:01.999
It's not like we have a whole lot else to go on.

06:02.066 --> 06:04.319
No crime scene, no body.

06:04.391 --> 06:06.095
We're already doing everything we can.

06:06.192 --> 06:09.003
We've alerted the police departments to be on the lookout for her car.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.481
The bank is standing by, waiting for any credit card activity.

06:11.553 --> 06:14.969
We've even got the cell phone provider to alert us if she makes a phone call.

06:15.111 --> 06:18.193
I told him you work with me, that these kind of situations are your specialty.

06:20.539 --> 06:24.533
Those are sort of boiler plate things we say to people in missing persons cases.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.913
Things to get the conversation started.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.591
Does he know he's a suspect?

06:30.482 --> 06:31.485
But he's not.

06:32.234 --> 06:33.877
Does he know we're suspicious?

06:35.584 --> 06:37.477
He doesn't strike me as a stupid man.

06:40.830 --> 06:43.508
Well, obviously, any current pictures would be helpful.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.128
And if she has a phone book or a PDA, we could start calling everyone.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.806
We could see if she's reached out to anyone.

06:50.185 --> 06:53.282
Who knows? Maybe she's just visiting a friend, or...

06:53.348 --> 06:54.301
Are you married?

06:54.727 --> 06:55.433
Yes.

06:57.245 --> 06:58.361
You  ever do that?

06:59.007 --> 07:01.408
Just go off and visit a friend--

07:01.566 --> 07:03.676
not tell your husband, not tell anyone?

07:05.212 --> 07:08.325
I'm sure you've been asked this a hundred times, but

07:08.453 --> 07:10.300
do you mind telling me what happened?

07:12.825 --> 07:15.867
But I don't know what happened.

07:16.051 --> 07:17.355
That's why I'm here.

07:17.607 --> 07:20.403
No, I... I mean, from your perspective.

07:20.536 --> 07:22.344
How did you discover she was gone?

07:27.628 --> 07:29.256
Can you not just read this somewhere?

07:30.540 --> 07:33.397
16 different people have taken my statement already.

07:33.628 --> 07:36.455
I... I feel like we're wasting time.

07:36.562 --> 07:38.589
She's out there somewhere. She could be hurt.

07:39.075 --> 07:43.490
- She could be...
- It would really be helpful if I could hear it from you.

07:45.204 --> 07:48.912
Yes, of course it would. I knew that.

07:49.059 --> 07:50.160
- I know that.
- Mr. Call...

07:50.232 --> 07:53.929
The sooner you... The sooner you rule me out, the sooner--

07:54.011 --> 07:56.355
- Mr. Call... 
- No-- the sooner you can move this along.

07:57.022 --> 07:57.727
I get it.

07:58.348 --> 08:00.602
This bird's not moving until you run it, so let's run it.

08:01.097 --> 08:01.855
Excuse me?

08:03.314 --> 08:05.224
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's...

08:06.428 --> 08:09.478
It's just sky jockey talk. It's something that we say at work.

08:09.552 --> 08:10.291
You're a pilot?

08:10.910 --> 08:12.584
Yes, ma'am. Sunbeam Air.

08:13.523 --> 08:14.599
They didn't tell you?

08:16.027 --> 08:17.046
Sunbeam, huh?

08:17.758 --> 08:19.022
You fly out of Phoenix?

08:19.448 --> 08:22.141
Yes, round trip to Cleveland three times a week.

08:23.404 --> 08:28.183
Folks, I've just been informed by air traffic control that we're flying into some nasty weather,

08:28.233 --> 08:31.840
and to expect some pretty good chop, so I'm flipping on the fasten seat belt sign

08:31.900 --> 08:35.546
I'd like to ask our flight attendants to have a seat at this time, too. Thank you.

08:43.505 --> 08:44.705
I can't be hurt.

08:45.294 --> 08:46.768
I'm invulnerable.

08:54.529 --> 08:59.266
Oh, no, no, man, no. Not today. Not on my anniversary.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.752
Pull back on that yoke!

09:01.145 --> 09:03.373
I'm pulling, there's just nothing there!

09:07.459 --> 09:10.557
Checklist says to just keep pulling back on that yoke.

09:15.958 --> 09:16.966
What the hell are you doing?

09:17.039 --> 09:18.113
Shutting it all down.

09:18.650 --> 09:19.952
Then we'll fire it back up again.

09:20.005 --> 09:22.871
God, what did you do?! You're gonna drive us right into the earth!

09:28.604 --> 09:30.274
- We're dead!
- I don't think so.

09:30.366 --> 09:31.477
Oh, my God!

09:42.859 --> 09:43.663
Okay.

09:48.962 --> 09:50.072
I told you so.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.203
Ma'am?

09:53.023 --> 09:54.420
Ma'am, are you okay?

09:55.459 --> 09:57.609
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you okay?

09:58.898 --> 10:01.951
- You all right?
- Oh. I'm fine, I'm sorry.

10:02.457 --> 10:03.247
Okay.

10:03.477 --> 10:07.434
What can tell you? How can I help? How can I help move this along?

10:07.496 --> 10:11.741
Can I ask you a question... about flying?

10:12.361 --> 10:13.211
Excuse me?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.750
About flying. About being a pilot.

10:16.425 --> 10:20.271
Would you mind if I ask you-- Have you ever had any close calls up there?

10:21.222 --> 10:23.475
Ma'am, what does this have to do with my wife?

10:23.649 --> 10:24.629
I'm not sure.

10:34.746 --> 10:35.411
No.

10:37.593 --> 10:38.718
I mean, no.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.649
No, I... I blew out a tire on a landing in Salt Lake City one time,

10:43.711 --> 10:46.121
but that's about as bad as it's ever gotten for me.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.541
Do you mind if I ask you, when is your anniversary? Your wedding anniversary?

10:51.924 --> 10:52.860
Are you serious?

10:53.393 --> 10:55.348
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:56.105 --> 10:57.708
I didn't mean to pry.

10:58.184 --> 11:00.361
- I can look it up.
- It's next week, actually.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.499
March 31.

11:05.271 --> 11:07.596
31st... of March.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.025
Thank you.

11:13.212 --> 11:14.907
This has been very helpful.

11:18.476 --> 11:20.037
You're a very odd woman.

11:24.174 --> 11:25.849
I'm afraid that I don't understand.

11:27.191 --> 11:29.949
I had a dream last night about a plane crash.

11:30.036 --> 11:31.957
At least, it looked like it was about to crash.

11:32.186 --> 11:34.339
But  it didn't, and now I know it never will.

11:34.541 --> 11:36.626
Because it turns out Mr. Call in there--

11:36.733 --> 11:37.875
Captain Call--

11:38.525 --> 11:39.785
he's the pilot.

11:40.041 --> 11:43.790
And he pulls the plane out of a dive before it goes down.

11:44.069 --> 11:45.781
I see. And when does this happen?

11:45.848 --> 11:47.875
Could be in a week. Could be a year from next week.

11:47.936 --> 11:50.968
- All I know is it hasn't happened yet.
- And how do you know that?

11:51.172 --> 11:53.779
'Cause  he told me-- not directly--

11:53.881 --> 11:57.254
but I asked him if he ever had a close call as a pilot, and he said "no."

11:57.752 --> 12:00.101
Okay, I must be the slowest guy in the room.

12:00.936 --> 12:04.592
So tell me again, one more time, how this dream you had proves that fellow didn't kill his wife?

12:04.664 --> 12:05.678
Think about it.

12:05.989 --> 12:09.175
He can't be sitting in the cockpit of a jet, ready to save a plane,

12:09.240 --> 12:11.177
if he's in jail for murdering his wife.

12:11.299 --> 12:12.328
That doesn't prove anything.

12:12.421 --> 12:13.471
Right, not directly.

12:13.674 --> 12:17.336
But the fact that I see him do this, the fact that it hasn't happened yet,

12:17.669 --> 12:20.587
means that it's something that's going to happen in the future.

12:20.797 --> 12:24.698
And in order for it to happen in the future means he doesn't go to jail.

12:24.770 --> 12:28.103
And that would suggest that he didn't do anything.

12:30.136 --> 12:31.345
Help me out here, Manny.

12:32.530 --> 12:34.468
Don't ask me. I don't have a clue.

12:34.528 --> 12:37.918
Well, I do, and I'm telling you this man had nothing to do with his wife going missing.

12:37.985 --> 12:38.563
Fine.

12:38.906 --> 12:42.141
Neither one of us necessarily disagrees with your conclusion...

12:42.214 --> 12:46.340
Another thing. Wherever she is, she's still alive, and she's going to stay that way.

12:47.626 --> 12:48.788
Well, that's great news.

12:49.506 --> 12:50.216
Are you sure?

12:50.299 --> 12:53.272
All I can tell you is... whenever that plane starts going down,

12:53.355 --> 12:55.639
they're still celebrating wedding anniversaries.

12:57.312 --> 12:59.514
Looks like you and I have a missing wife to find.

13:13.129 --> 13:14.168
Oh, my God.

13:15.146 --> 13:17.384
This time, it's me having a scary dream.

13:17.507 --> 13:19.626
- What do you mean?
- Well, look at you. It's morning.

13:19.713 --> 13:23.420
You're not waking up from some apocalyptic vision with your heart pounding.

13:23.604 --> 13:24.838
And you're smiling.

13:26.446 --> 13:28.131
It's got to be a dream.

13:28.227 --> 13:29.733
Actually, I slept through the night.

13:30.373 --> 13:31.683
I'm getting chills.

13:31.781 --> 13:35.688
I think the only possible explanation is for the first time in a long time...

13:36.579 --> 13:37.629
I'm content.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.746
Hmm. "First time in a long time"?

13:41.192 --> 13:43.957
Does that mean up to now, our marriage has been a fraud?

13:44.069 --> 13:46.071
No, I'm not talking about us. I mean in here.

13:48.053 --> 13:50.934
I feel like I, like I accomplished something.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.967
Like I... I contributed something.

13:55.882 --> 14:00.045
I helped redirect everyone's attention on where it needed to be.

14:00.193 --> 14:04.938
Finding that woman and bringing her home so that she and her airline pilot husband

14:05.042 --> 14:09.007
could live happily ever after, and he could fulfill his destiny

14:09.048 --> 14:12.855
by helping that plane and those passengers through that horrible calamity.

14:12.930 --> 14:15.153
Boy, it doesn't take much to make you content.

14:15.245 --> 14:19.526
Avert one minor disaster, and there's no getting that goofy grin off your face.

14:25.004 --> 14:28.767
Now, listen, I don't mean to burst your "all's right with the world" bubble,

14:28.859 --> 14:30.985
but did you happen to notice anything unusual last night

14:31.046 --> 14:32.337
when you kissed Bridgette good night?

14:32.409 --> 14:33.493
No, not really.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.981
She didn't look a little like a crash test dummy to you?

14:36.616 --> 14:37.759
What are you talking about?

14:38.512 --> 14:40.937
Did you not notice the bicycle helmet on her head?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.114
She's been wearing it for two days straight now.

14:43.365 --> 14:45.433
- And...?
- Morning, Mommy. Morning, Daddy.

14:45.722 --> 14:47.031
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

14:47.543 --> 14:49.008
Good morning, sweeties.

14:50.743 --> 14:53.591
I really sleep good in this new bike helmet.

14:53.708 --> 14:54.414
All  right.

14:57.813 --> 15:00.497
Don't you think it's a little strange? Don't you think it's a little peculiar?

15:01.009 --> 15:04.322
Don't you think when you have a child who's unique and doesn't make friends easily...?

15:04.387 --> 15:05.192
And...?

15:05.756 --> 15:09.012
Don't you think we should discourage anything that appears overly... eccentric?

15:09.109 --> 15:10.209
This is a bad dream.

15:10.819 --> 15:12.919
It's okay; she's okay. It's normal.

15:13.020 --> 15:14.674
She does this all the time.

15:14.803 --> 15:15.862
You're just not aware of it.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.510
Last time, it was the SpongeBob underwear.

15:18.571 --> 15:21.935
I had to wash them every night so she could wear it the next day for, like, a week and a half.

15:22.002 --> 15:24.050
And before that, it was her ballet slippers.

15:24.142 --> 15:27.659
She insisted on wearing them to school, in bed, in the bath.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.770
I mean, trust me. Leave it alone; it will pass.

15:32.161 --> 15:33.911
Well, I'm sorry, I'm not sure we should leave it alone.

15:33.952 --> 15:36.190
I'm not sure we shouldn't sit down and talk with her.

15:38.156 --> 15:38.852
Morning.

15:40.117 --> 15:40.976
Yeah, she's right here.

15:41.166 --> 15:41.899
It's your boss.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.197
Hello.

15:46.108 --> 15:47.663
Wow, that is good news.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.834
Um, I'd love to meet you there,

15:49.890 --> 15:53.709
but I have to see if I can get someone to take the kids to school this morning,

15:53.760 --> 15:55.037
and I can.

15:55.605 --> 15:57.437
Okay, so I'll see you in 45 minutes.

16:04.550 --> 16:05.347
Trust me.

16:07.961 --> 16:10.120
This was exactly the break I was hoping for.

16:10.202 --> 16:12.359
As soon as we went public with the fact that she was missing

16:12.409 --> 16:16.705
and started to publicize her license plate number, I knew it was only a matter of time.

16:16.827 --> 16:18.886
Once this shopping mall parking lot emptied out last night,

16:18.953 --> 16:22.082
somebody realized this car had been sitting here in the same spot a couple of days.

16:22.301 --> 16:24.690
Then they compared the license plate with the one in the paper.

16:28.608 --> 16:29.582
Hey, we're out of here.

16:29.679 --> 16:32.218
The seats, the steering wheel, the dash-- everything's wrapped in plastic.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.153
We'll keep working on the car when it gets to the impound.

16:34.231 --> 16:36.012
- It's all yours, Mr. District Attorney.
- Thanks.

16:36.565 --> 16:39.290
No purse, no cell phone, no signs of a struggle.

16:39.371 --> 16:42.766
Whoever took her knew her, and wasn't leaving anything behind.

16:42.852 --> 16:45.601
If there were no signs of a struggle, how do you know someone took her?

16:47.968 --> 16:48.710
Have a seat.

16:53.718 --> 16:54.941
Mrs. Call is five-two.

16:55.494 --> 16:56.324
So am I.

16:56.666 --> 16:57.993
How we doing with the pedals over there?

16:58.765 --> 17:00.527
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

17:00.711 --> 17:01.863
Now check your mirrors.

17:04.433 --> 17:07.972
Well, I can't see anything but the ceiling in the rearview mirror...

17:08.892 --> 17:11.423
and the passenger side view is no help, either.

17:11.483 --> 17:12.446
Do you know why?

17:13.143 --> 17:15.031
Whoever drove the car was taller than Mrs. Call,

17:15.083 --> 17:17.397
but smart enough to put the seat back to her original position.

17:17.473 --> 17:18.810
Just forgot about the mirrors.

17:18.964 --> 17:23.102
Let's close the driver's door again so I can check the side view mirror, just to be sure.

17:32.653 --> 17:35.334
What do you see? It's screwed up, right-- the mirror?

18:00.205 --> 18:02.296
Allison, hey, you're not even looking at the mirror.

18:02.997 --> 18:04.923
Three-three-one-two...

18:05.282 --> 18:06.845
zero-zero-three.

18:07.308 --> 18:09.764
One-one-two-three-

18:10.068 --> 18:11.604
one-eight-nine-three.

18:11.685 --> 18:12.634
Open the door!

18:13.418 --> 18:15.092
- Write this down.
- Write what down?

18:15.306 --> 18:19.100
Three-three-one-two-zero-zero-three.

18:20.139 --> 18:22.459
One-one-two-three...

18:23.027 --> 18:24.901
one-eight-nine-three.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.343
- One-one-two-three...
- ...one-eight-nine-three.

18:27.415 --> 18:29.168
What the hell is that, the next winning lotto numbers?

18:29.254 --> 18:32.546
That's where he took her. That's the latitude and the longitude of where he took her.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.309
Joe?

18:44.968 --> 18:45.780
Hey, what's up?

18:46.324 --> 18:47.456
God, where are you calling from?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.058
It sounds like you're coming from the moon.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.712
Actually, I'm in the middle of the desert.

18:51.116 --> 18:54.106
I started to get a good fix on where Call's wife might be,

18:54.168 --> 18:56.461
so the DA, Detective Scanlon and I,

18:56.627 --> 18:59.074
and a couple of state troopers are headed out there.

18:59.165 --> 19:01.141
Well, that's great news, isn't it?

19:01.802 --> 19:02.995
Yeah, I don't know.

19:04.008 --> 19:05.171
She's dead, Joe.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.560
Does her husband know?

19:09.067 --> 19:12.251
No,  not yet. Nobody knows. I didn't tell anybody.

19:12.528 --> 19:13.998
What do you mean? Why?

19:14.357 --> 19:17.702
Why? 'Cause yesterday, I was sure that she was alive.

19:17.761 --> 19:21.449
Yesterday, I was sure that her husband was innocent.

19:21.929 --> 19:24.453
Now I'm starting to think I was wrong about all of it.

19:24.546 --> 19:26.142
Uh, hold on a second, Allison.

19:26.302 --> 19:27.771
Aren't you putting the cart before the horse?

19:27.837 --> 19:30.403
Why don't you just wait and see what you find out there in the desert.

19:30.489 --> 19:32.608
Maybe she's fine; maybe everything's fine.

19:33.403 --> 19:34.156
Yeah.

19:34.708 --> 19:35.502
Right.

19:36.418 --> 19:37.156
Maybe.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.089
I guess I'm not sure I know what we're looking for.

20:03.764 --> 20:05.597
A shack? A car?

20:10.375 --> 20:12.756
Do we maybe want to rethink this? Double-check our numbers?

20:15.557 --> 20:16.415
Allison.

21:13.828 --> 21:15.718
Allison, you okay? Everything all right?

21:16.095 --> 21:16.847
Yeah.

21:17.780 --> 21:18.590
No!

21:20.572 --> 21:21.584
She's here.

21:22.608 --> 21:24.299
She's buried right here.

21:33.384 --> 21:37.036
Folks, I'm going to ask the flight attendants to take their seats for a couple of minutes here.

21:37.089 --> 21:38.724
We're heading into some rough weather,

21:38.935 --> 21:40.978
but I guarantee you we'll get you through it.

21:41.071 --> 21:44.665
And we'll let you folks know just as soon as we get through this turbulence here, okay?

21:47.702 --> 21:49.109
Damn. It's getting rough up here.

21:53.055 --> 21:54.182
What the...?

22:00.797 --> 22:02.652
Pull back on the yoke.

22:03.978 --> 22:05.535
Elevators aren't responding.

22:10.189 --> 22:11.925
Oh, my God. Oh, my god.

22:12.610 --> 22:13.456
Mayday!

22:15.672 --> 22:17.304
Mayday! Mayday!

22:22.630 --> 22:24.203
A little cold over here.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.690
I'm sorry.

22:30.633 --> 22:32.369
I was in the middle of a plane crash.

22:33.450 --> 22:35.789
It was that same flight.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.177
Cleveland to Phoenix, but this time,

22:39.913 --> 22:42.511
Call wasn't the pilot. It was this other guy, and...

22:44.456 --> 22:46.269
that guy did the wrong thing, and...

22:47.130 --> 22:48.415
the plane went down.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.518
All the people died.

22:52.475 --> 22:53.864
It was a dream, Al.

22:54.528 --> 22:56.004
But what does it mean?

22:56.484 --> 22:58.267
I don't know, babe, 

22:58.687 --> 23:00.349
but it's the middle of the night.

23:07.861 --> 23:13.242
I want to thank everyone in the community for their support and their prayers.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.319
What went through your mind when you first got the call that she'd been found?

23:16.401 --> 23:19.566
You know... I-I don't want to answer that.

23:20.645 --> 23:22.309
But you know what I do want?

23:23.617 --> 23:28.403
I want her to be remembered for the wonderful person that she was.

23:28.931 --> 23:31.220
I want her to be remembered for her life.

23:31.352 --> 23:34.860
It would be an unspeakable tragedy if the only thing that people remembered,

23:34.921 --> 23:38.279
the only thing people that spoke of, was the fact...

23:38.833 --> 23:43.195
that this... monster snatched her from us.

23:44.203 --> 23:47.286
Um, obviously, this is a very difficult time for all of us.

23:48.115 --> 23:50.670
My wife's parents both passed away last year...

23:52.078 --> 23:52.800
and now this.

23:53.469 --> 23:55.033
Are there plans for a memorial?

23:55.099 --> 23:57.637
If people want to send flowers and condolences?

23:57.982 --> 24:02.015
Instead of sending flowers, what would be really wonderful is

24:02.073 --> 24:06.869
if they could make donations to the Youth Outreach Project of Downtown Phoenix.

24:08.396 --> 24:11.309
My wife was very committed to her volunteer work there.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.242
And, uh, as for the service, uh...

24:15.901 --> 24:18.406
there's no date set as of yet.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.746
Actually, I just...

24:22.026 --> 24:24.458
want a little... time to go by.

24:25.921 --> 24:28.262
Our wedding anniversary is next week.

24:29.762 --> 24:31.722
It would've been next week.

24:32.725 --> 24:33.991
March 31st.

24:35.347 --> 24:37.089
We would've been married two years.

24:42.869 --> 24:46.335
I just want a little... little time to go by.

25:48.661 --> 25:52.891
Oh, uh, hello, Mrs. Dubois, from the District Attorney's office.

25:53.054 --> 25:56.142
I'm sorry to show up so early in the morning on such a difficult day.

25:56.204 --> 25:57.565
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.

25:57.852 --> 25:59.603
It's good. It's... actually, it's good.

25:59.992 --> 26:06.658
I... I, uh, overslept, and I'm expecting a delivery here any minute, so it's, uh... it's good.

26:08.655 --> 26:11.579
Um, anyway, I, uh, I-I wanted to thank you.

26:12.049 --> 26:15.387
I heard from the police that you were somehow involved in...

26:15.521 --> 26:19.689
in finding Marcia-- my-my wife's... body.

26:21.165 --> 26:25.060
When I think about where she was, I mean... we might never have found her.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.468
It might've been months.

26:28.327 --> 26:30.672
So, um... anyway, thank you.

26:30.748 --> 26:34.076
That's the reason I drove over here. I-I couldn't sleep last night,

26:34.132 --> 26:36.259
and I was watching you on television,

26:36.426 --> 26:39.800
and you were talking about how it would've been your anniversary next week.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.036
And I noticed the most peculiar thing...

26:43.129 --> 26:44.732
The latitudinal coordinates.

26:44.930 --> 26:46.384
Do you know what I mean by that?

26:48.797 --> 26:51.408
Yeah. I'm a pilot. Yes.

26:53.154 --> 26:57.413
Well, the latitudinal coordinates of where we found you wife's body...

26:58.048 --> 27:03.307
Three-three, dot, one-two, zero, zero, three.

27:04.244 --> 27:07.168
Those are the exact same numbers in the exact same order

27:07.786 --> 27:09.768
as the date of your anniversary,

27:10.151 --> 27:12.533
if you were to express that date numerically.

27:12.682 --> 27:16.218
March 31, 2003.

27:17.930 --> 27:22.594
Three, 31, two, zero, zero, three.

27:24.631 --> 27:26.962
Mr. Call? Okay if we bring these in?

27:29.076 --> 27:31.881
Excuse me. People will be coming over.

27:32.236 --> 27:33.741
They'll be paying their respects.

27:33.987 --> 27:35.553
- Oh, oh, I...
- Yes, come on in.

27:35.625 --> 27:37.354
- By all means...
- Just do it. Why don't you just...?

27:38.154 --> 27:41.301
Set those up in the, uh, living room, please. Thank you.

27:46.955 --> 27:49.402
I'm not sure I know where you're going with this.

27:49.530 --> 27:53.130
I'm not necessarily going anywhere. I just thought it was peculiar.

27:53.207 --> 27:54.563
I thought it was interesting.

27:54.880 --> 27:58.240
Well, forgive me, but I think you're peculiar.

28:00.626 --> 28:04.926
My wife is dead. And I just think it is just completely odd for you

28:04.972 --> 28:07.533
to come driving all the way over here at the crack of dawn

28:07.620 --> 28:11.358
to point out some weird numeric coincidence to me.

28:11.480 --> 28:15.561
Okay? I mean, are you one of these people that thinks there's some relationship

28:15.612 --> 28:18.782
between 9/11 and dialing 911 to call the police?

28:18.869 --> 28:22.079
Mr. Call, I'm going to need you to come out and count some chairs

28:22.140 --> 28:24.719
and tables and glass and china and then sign the inventory list.

28:24.808 --> 28:25.597
Okay.

28:27.092 --> 28:28.356
I'll be right back.

29:14.654 --> 29:15.813
Thank you, Mr. Call.

29:15.978 --> 29:18.252
We'll be back in a couple days to pick up everything.

29:18.671 --> 29:21.994
And by the way, we're all really sorry about everything.

29:22.287 --> 29:24.088
Thank you. I appreciate you saying that.

29:26.713 --> 29:27.586
Is there anything else?

29:27.891 --> 29:30.262
Have you, uh, discovered any other odd factoids

29:30.323 --> 29:33.974
that might further diminish my wife's memory and trivialize her death?

29:34.046 --> 29:37.159
No. I'm terribly sorry if I upset you.

29:38.300 --> 29:39.314
I'm sure you are.

29:39.949 --> 29:41.848
If you don't mind, I have to get ready.

29:42.309 --> 29:43.707
People will be coming over.

29:56.226 --> 29:58.110
Girls, come on! Time's a-wastin'!

30:01.147 --> 30:03.129
Wow! Look at you.

30:03.415 --> 30:04.505
What's the occasion?

30:04.751 --> 30:06.410
It's Picture Day, Daddy.

30:06.563 --> 30:08.991
Everybody in school is getting their picture taken.

30:09.145 --> 30:11.873
Picture Day. Cool. I love Picture Day.

30:12.094 --> 30:12.959
Ready!

30:19.089 --> 30:22.062
What's the problem? Why are we all standing here?

30:22.475 --> 30:23.813
It's Picture Day.

30:23.967 --> 30:25.395
We don't want to be late.

30:29.030 --> 30:32.938
Bridge, come on. You and I need to have a little talk.

30:37.501 --> 30:39.561
Are you going to cancel Christmas?

30:41.359 --> 30:42.353
Bridge, honey.

30:43.085 --> 30:45.603
It's March. Christmas is a long way...

30:46.521 --> 30:48.265
Nobody can cancel Christmas.

30:48.354 --> 30:49.982
I don't want to talk about Christmas.

30:50.565 --> 30:52.506
I want to talk about Picture Day.

30:52.696 --> 30:53.458
Okay.

30:54.401 --> 30:57.389
Well, you know, Picture Day is really important.

30:57.549 --> 30:59.920
Every year, you get these pictures taken,

31:00.048 --> 31:04.995
and that's your picture for that grade, for that year, for all time.

31:05.787 --> 31:06.657
Okay.

31:07.338 --> 31:10.575
And that's the picture we're gonna send to friends at Christmas

31:10.646 --> 31:14.645
and Grandma in Florida and hang on the refrigerator.

31:14.829 --> 31:15.659
Okay.

31:16.007 --> 31:19.607
And I want everyone to see your pretty face and your beautiful eyes

31:19.724 --> 31:21.383
and your wavy hair, you know?

31:22.842 --> 31:25.699
So what do you say maybe you leave the bike helmet at home today?

31:30.716 --> 31:34.178
You know, Daddy, you can cancel Christmas, if you want.

31:34.281 --> 31:35.565
It's okay with me.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.088
What are you doing here?

31:42.207 --> 31:43.917
I thought Daddy was taking you to school.

31:44.086 --> 31:47.409
He's talking to Bridgette about her h-e-l-m-e-t.

31:47.486 --> 31:48.121
Oh, no.

31:48.321 --> 31:49.221
Oh, yes.

31:50.383 --> 31:51.751
Hey, I remember you.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.981
You left me a note in the middle of the night?

31:55.197 --> 31:56.369
It's good to see you again.

31:56.830 --> 31:57.633
Hi, Mommy!

31:59.053 --> 32:00.957
Hi, Lambchop.

32:01.039 --> 32:02.329
You look beautiful.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.081
You both look beautiful.

32:04.478 --> 32:07.053
Hey, guys, do me a favor. Go wait in the car.

32:07.530 --> 32:08.672
I'll be out in a second.

32:13.482 --> 32:15.635
- One morning I ask you to cover me.
- One?!

32:15.702 --> 32:17.065
- One morning!
- Second time this week!

32:17.156 --> 32:18.979
- After years of "I've got to work late."
- I have a job, too.

32:19.045 --> 32:21.145
- "I got to work this weekend, babe."
- Maybe I'm not out there saving the world

32:21.202 --> 32:23.321
- from bad dreams and bogeymen, but you know what?
- And I would think, I would hope, you would assume

32:23.378 --> 32:25.042
- what I was doing is pretty damn important.
- I have a job, too,

32:25.194 --> 32:27.385
and one of those jobs is to be Bridgette's father.

32:27.458 --> 32:30.949
I am entitled to an opinion on things like how she looks.

32:31.047 --> 32:33.238
It's her class picture, for goodness sake.

32:33.378 --> 32:36.019
I would have thought, out of deference to me, out of some sort of consideration

32:36.074 --> 32:38.794
for the fact that we're all going to have to look at this for the next 50 years,

32:38.860 --> 32:44.182
that maybe, maybe you could stop indulging her eccentricities and take a stand!

32:44.256 --> 32:45.618
Except, I think you like it!

32:45.693 --> 32:47.698
Well, you know what, I do like it.

32:47.881 --> 32:49.987
I do like it, and you want to know why?

32:50.067 --> 32:53.775
Because those pictures are supposed to capture how they really look,

32:53.877 --> 32:57.604
who they really are, before they change, before they're gone.

32:57.968 --> 33:01.019
And today, who she really is is a little girl

33:01.076 --> 33:04.252
who's in love with the way that a red helmet looks on her head.

33:04.318 --> 33:07.251
And that's great. 'Cause that's who she is!

33:07.317 --> 33:08.265
Today!

33:09.597 --> 33:11.930
Just relax! She's not getting married in it.

33:13.493 --> 33:14.583
What am I doing?

33:15.039 --> 33:17.062
I haven't slept. I haven't had any coffee.

33:17.112 --> 33:19.933
The kids are sitting in the car. I got to get the baby, take everyone to school...!

33:20.000 --> 33:21.875
Hey, hey, hey, I'll do that.

33:21.941 --> 33:23.871
Oh, no, no, no. Please, I wouldn't want to interrupt you.

33:23.921 --> 33:26.293
You're very busy "woe is Joeing."

33:28.867 --> 33:30.404
You want to hear something funny?

33:31.013 --> 33:34.163
I was racing back home hoping that you would still be here,

33:34.244 --> 33:38.427
'cause I had this crazy idea that I needed to talk to you.

33:38.816 --> 33:41.398
That you would help me sort this all out.

33:41.576 --> 33:44.714
That you could help me figure out my-- what did you call it?

33:45.092 --> 33:48.627
My bogeyman and my... bad dreams?

33:49.917 --> 33:51.750
All right, it was a bad choice of words.

33:52.762 --> 33:53.586
I'm sorry.

33:55.757 --> 33:57.811
What do you want to talk about? What do you want to sort out?

34:00.750 --> 34:04.534
If you knew that 200 people were going to die, and you could prevent it...

34:05.912 --> 34:07.740
So far, this is not a tough question.

34:07.856 --> 34:13.377
No, but it meant that you had to compromise everything that you believe in,

34:13.623 --> 34:18.418
and that you would have to let a guy go who committed an unspeakable act...

34:20.329 --> 34:21.779
...what would you do?

34:22.909 --> 34:25.418
I'll get the baby. We'll drive the kids together.

34:26.109 --> 34:28.766
You can drop me off at work and explain this to me on the way.

34:33.453 --> 34:36.257
Well, if you're convinced he's guilty, you have to go to Devalos.

34:36.344 --> 34:37.440
I'm not sure I should.

34:37.554 --> 34:38.556
What-What are you talking about?

34:39.626 --> 34:41.940
My dream last night. I think I know what it means.

34:43.045 --> 34:45.438
That plane crashed when Call wasn't flying it.

34:45.489 --> 34:48.167
If Call goes to prison, he won't be the pilot.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.614
And hundreds of people will die? Is that what you're saying?

34:52.074 --> 34:54.996
You realize that's an absurd assertion, don't you?

34:55.935 --> 34:57.530
You can't control the future.

34:57.838 --> 35:00.834
The future is subject to hundreds and billions of variables,

35:00.911 --> 35:02.887
almost none of which are in your control.

35:03.328 --> 35:05.721
- I know what I saw.
- What you dreamt, darling.

35:05.902 --> 35:08.181
And how many times have you thought a dream means one thing,

35:08.222 --> 35:10.633
only to discover that it meant something completely different?

35:10.854 --> 35:12.840
I mean, isn't that how we got here in the first place?

35:12.980 --> 35:15.106
- This time I know.
- No, this time, again, you assume.

35:15.202 --> 35:17.190
Just like the last time, when you assumed,

35:17.252 --> 35:20.169
because you saw him fly the plane, that he must innocent.

35:20.251 --> 35:24.596
Just like you assumed that when he mentioned an anniversary, that his wife must be alive.

35:24.674 --> 35:27.649
And now you're assuming that because you dreamed this plane crash,

35:27.731 --> 35:30.787
that somehow it's your responsibility-- --no, your duty--

35:30.879 --> 35:33.910
to turn your back on the one thing that does seem reasonably certain:

35:34.079 --> 35:35.779
That this man killed his wife.

35:35.845 --> 35:37.782
But what about all those people? What about that plane?

35:37.843 --> 35:40.213
What about that woman he buried in the desert?

35:40.387 --> 35:44.468
What about the way he used the date of their anniversary to choose a place to dump her?

35:44.945 --> 35:47.694
What about her family and their grief?

35:47.882 --> 35:49.342
And what about justice?

35:49.751 --> 35:54.073
You're willing to turn your back on all of that for something you're afraid might happen?

35:54.524 --> 35:56.895
I'm sorry, honey, that doesn't sound like justice to me.

35:56.976 --> 35:58.517
That sounds like cowardice.

36:08.005 --> 36:12.137
So he had the means, and he had the motive.

36:12.357 --> 36:15.527
What we need is a piece of physical evidence that ties him to...

36:15.889 --> 36:16.945
Well, hello, stranger.

36:17.779 --> 36:20.461
We were just comparing notes on your friend Captain Call. You all right?

36:22.006 --> 36:22.827
Do you need me?

36:24.023 --> 36:25.705
Folks, could you give us five minutes?

36:25.863 --> 36:26.642
Thanks.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.669
Not withstanding your conviction that the man had absolutely nothing to do

36:31.715 --> 36:36.897
with his wife's abduction, we've discovered a couple of very interesting omissions in his story.

36:36.963 --> 36:40.849
Remember how two of his neighbors testified they saw Captain Call leave for work at 4:00,

36:40.911 --> 36:43.179
and then his wife leave the house at around 5:15,

36:43.256 --> 36:45.678
thus providing him with what should have been an airtight alibi?

36:45.729 --> 36:50.107
Turns out, his flight that normally leaves at 6:00 p.m. was delayed for four hours.

36:50.173 --> 36:53.486
And it turns out, Mrs. Call's parents both died last year in a boating accident,

36:53.562 --> 36:55.990
leaving a rather considerable fortune to their only daughter.

36:56.051 --> 37:00.311
Which, obviously, the husband would inherit, should she pass first.

37:04.109 --> 37:05.108
Allison...

37:08.283 --> 37:09.634
...you look like you're going to cry.

37:12.031 --> 37:13.736
Everybody's wrong once in a while.

37:14.084 --> 37:15.476
You did lead us to the victim's body.

37:15.548 --> 37:16.505
No, it's not that.

37:17.218 --> 37:20.300
In fact, I'm fairly certain that he did kill his wife.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.458
In fact, I think I have the physical evidence to prove it.

37:26.281 --> 37:27.631
This is Captain Call's.

37:28.180 --> 37:31.021
This is his security badge from the airport.

37:32.716 --> 37:36.341
If you'll look inside the plastic protector, you'll see grains of sand.

37:36.663 --> 37:38.660
I'm pretty sure, if you have it tested,

37:39.069 --> 37:42.295
you'll find it's from the desert where we discovered the body.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.996
Wait a second. Where are you going?

37:44.533 --> 37:46.208
I have to get to the airport. I-I...

37:47.256 --> 37:49.002
What's going on? You got people coming in?

37:50.818 --> 37:52.254
I guess you could say that.

37:54.276 --> 37:59.996
When you see Captain Call, wish him a happy anniversary for me.

38:13.114 --> 38:14.489
Going to work?

38:16.221 --> 38:17.613
You're probably gonna need this.

38:19.935 --> 38:21.448
You hear that sand?

38:22.192 --> 38:24.787
Turns out it's from the desert where your wife's body was found.

38:24.956 --> 38:29.022
Hmm. Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't.

38:29.255 --> 38:33.009
One thing's for certain: You didn't obtain that security pass with a search warrant.

38:33.208 --> 38:35.506
That means it's not admissible in court.

38:36.015 --> 38:39.004
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get ready for work.

38:39.045 --> 38:40.188
I have a plane to fly.

38:41.257 --> 38:43.199
You might want to call in sick, cowboy.

38:44.156 --> 38:45.498
I have a search warrant.

38:45.589 --> 38:49.593
I intend to vacuum every room, every rug, and every drape in this house to find more sand.

38:49.670 --> 38:52.999
I'll even vacuum between your toes, up your nose and in your ass, if I have to.

38:59.919 --> 39:04.324
Mrs. Dubois, at this point, its still circling over Cleveland.

39:04.457 --> 39:07.047
We're estimating it'll land about six minutes from now--

39:07.139 --> 39:08.599
a little late, due to weather.

39:08.809 --> 39:10.581
That's okay. I'll wait.

39:10.650 --> 39:14.113
Mrs. Dubois, I'm happy to tell you as soon as the plane has landed,

39:14.236 --> 39:17.693
but standing here and waiting like this-- it's just not necessary.

39:17.917 --> 39:19.258
You can call on your phone.

39:19.356 --> 39:21.455
You can monitor the flight on your computer at home.

39:21.522 --> 39:22.894
But you'll know first, right?

39:23.122 --> 39:25.556
I mean, you'll know the second that they actually land.

39:27.180 --> 39:29.279
That's okay. I'll wait.

39:42.905 --> 39:43.866
This seat taken?

39:44.537 --> 39:45.284
Hey.

39:47.440 --> 39:51.055
I want you to know, you're making our baby-sitter the richest 16-year-old in Phoenix.

39:53.114 --> 39:55.677
I took a cab. I thought you might want some company on the ride home.

40:00.383 --> 40:01.463
No word yet?

40:01.858 --> 40:03.961
Well, they took him into custody.

40:04.817 --> 40:08.591
As soon as they took the death penalty off the table, he confessed to everything.

40:08.959 --> 40:10.388
He'd been planning it for months.

40:10.469 --> 40:13.854
Waiting for a day when he knew in advance there'd be a long flight delay.

40:15.308 --> 40:18.283
Went to work on time, deliberately left his security pass,

40:18.380 --> 40:20.627
called his wife, asked her to bring it to the airport.

40:20.890 --> 40:22.610
When she arrived, he met her at curbside.

40:23.700 --> 40:26.748
Told her he had some extra time, invited her out to eat.

40:26.966 --> 40:30.520
Pulled into an alley, leaned across as if he was going to kiss her.

40:32.061 --> 40:34.676
He suffocated her with a plastic bag.

40:35.686 --> 40:38.189
Drove her out to the desert, buried her.

40:39.946 --> 40:44.922
Left her car at a shopping mall and still got back in time to fly that plane to Cleveland.

40:44.990 --> 40:45.926
Mrs. Dubois?

40:46.704 --> 40:49.562
Just wanted to let you know, the flight landed in Cleveland.

40:49.623 --> 40:51.721
They're taxiing to the arrival gate right now.

40:51.968 --> 40:52.812
Thank you.

40:55.163 --> 40:55.966
Let's go home.

40:56.604 --> 40:57.446
Hallelujah.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.437
March 31 has come and gone.

40:59.612 --> 41:02.422
Nothing crashed, no one died. All is right with the world.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.659
Well, this year, anyway.

41:24.760 --> 41:25.659
Hi, Daddy.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.259
Morning, Bridge.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.859
Where's your helmet?

41:33.180 --> 41:35.059
Hey, what's going on?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.959
Bridget's here, she's helmet free.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.459
No more helmet, really?

41:40.760 --> 41:42.999
I don't know, maybe when I ride my bike...

41:43.100 --> 41:45.109
Anyways... Here're the pictures.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.159
You guys weren't home before I went to bed.

41:47.260 --> 41:50.009
You guys have to decide which one is the one.
