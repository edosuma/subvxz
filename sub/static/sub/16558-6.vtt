who got second chances.

April Kepner,
Meredith Grey.

39:44.172 --> 39:47.175
And I wondered,
why did they need chances?

39:47.175 --> 39:49.177
Why did they screw up
in the first place?

39:49.177 --> 39:51.269
I'm sorry.
I don't see what you're --

39:51.269 --> 39:53.061
We used to be the leading
education program

39:53.061 --> 39:54.643
on the whole West Coast.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.645
So why would
a Leah Murphy fail here

39:56.645 --> 39:58.607
only to thrive
somewhere else?

40:00.018 --> 40:01.610
It's how we're teaching.

40:01.610 --> 40:03.822
There is a fundamental flaw

40:03.822 --> 40:06.525
in how we are teaching
our residents.

40:06.525 --> 40:08.737
And we have
got to fix this.

40:08.737 --> 40:09.868
You and me.

40:09.868 --> 40:11.289
And Dr. Webber.

40:18.587 --> 40:21.209
But sometimes
the threat isn't physical.

40:21.209 --> 40:23.712
Sometimes it goes deeper.

40:26.004 --> 40:30.759
In which case,
no instincts can save you.

40:30.759 --> 40:34.473

No adrenaline rush.

come home early.

40:45.524 --> 40:47.656
I had to check
