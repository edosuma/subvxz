<i>All the great philanthropists
of our time are businessmen.</i>

00:57.080 --> 00:59.367
<i>They are entrepreneurs, innovators.</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:02.927
<i>My Safe Haven project for refugees,</i>

01:03.000 --> 01:05.048

01:20.120 --> 01:22.487
<i>I thank you all for your time. Thank you.</i>

02:39.560 --> 02:40.686
I thought you might need some help.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.728
- How did you get here?
- I walked.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.529
- You walked? Through that?
- Yes.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.887
- Yes, I've seen worse.
- OK, you are crazy.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.360
I can assure you, madam,
we're doing everything we can.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.761
The British government
has chartered a plane

02:56.840 --> 02:58.763
- which will arrive in three days' time.
- Hey! Hello!

02:58.840 --> 03:00.251
- Hello.
- One moment, please.

03:00.320 --> 03:01.765
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm just dealing...

03:01.840 --> 03:03.569
You have to get us out now, do you hear?

03:03.640 --> 03:06.086
Madam, I can assure you,
the hotel is absolutely

03:06.160 --> 03:07.685
the safest place for you to be at the moment.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.171
Trust me.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.041
Madam, perhaps...

03:14.120 --> 03:15.849
You'd like to wait in the bar.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.207
The cocktails are... Complimentary.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.725
Thank you.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.206
Get them away from the windows. Away!

03:23.800 --> 03:26.371
Yes, this is Pine of the Nefertiti Hotel
in the Corniche.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.442
We have tear gas grenades
going off in the street

03:28.520 --> 03:30.090
fifty yards west of here.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.766
And I have several guests
extremely keen to leave.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.767
As soon as you can, please. Thank you.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.487
To the airport as fast as you can, please.
Thank you.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.881
Busy day for you.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.968
Well, we're doing the best that we can.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.447
Is there anything I can do for you, madam?

05:03.040 --> 05:04.849
Make me a coffee.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.604
Would you, Mr Pine?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.241
Sit with me.

05:19.720 --> 05:23.884
I'm afraid I can't, madam.
I have to arrange taxis for various guests.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.724
Oh, of course.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.090
Everyone must escape.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.083
Run, run, run.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.085
When are you leaving, Mr Pine?

05:34.040 --> 05:36.486
- I'm not.
- You don't want to escape?

05:40.440 --> 05:42.090
Then sit.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.811
Please, sit.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.163
What do you know of me?

05:51.240 --> 05:53.891
I know that your name is Ms Sophie Alekan.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.725
I know that you're staying
in the Hatshepsut suite.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.887
And do you know who is footing my bill?

06:08.760 --> 06:11.240
Freddie Hamid is everything
the protesters hate.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.608
Incredibly wealthy.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.011
Corrupt to the core.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.245
The Hamid family owns half the city, and...

06:21.080 --> 06:22.730
Freddie Hamid owns me.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.047
Before this all started,

06:27.120 --> 06:29.600
I saw you sailing at the Cairo Yacht Club.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.250
Did you?

06:32.280 --> 06:34.487
Well... It's only when I'm invited,

06:34.560 --> 06:36.767
which isn't often, to be honest.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.365
Who invites you?

06:38.440 --> 06:40.488
The second man at the British Embassy.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.881
- Name?
- His name's Ogilvey.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.004
Simon Ogilvey.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.770
And he's a friend of yours?

06:47.960 --> 06:50.008
Well, I know him from my army days.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.285
But you trust him?

06:52.720 --> 06:55.041
I trust him not to capsize a boat.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.087
I'd like you to copy some
personal documents for me, please.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.926
Well, we have an executive services
bureau just across the lobby.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.809
The documents are confidential.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.370
I can assure you Mr Ahmadi
is perfectly dependable.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.571
I would prefer to use your office.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.886
Do it for me, please.

07:34.840 --> 07:35.887
Yes, ma' am.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.890
just one copy, madam?

08:07.640 --> 08:08.971
Yes.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.645
Will that be all, madam?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.202
- Do you have an envelope?
- Yes.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.362
Seal it and put it in your safe.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.809
And, Mr Pine...

08:48.840 --> 08:50.968
If an accident was to happen to me

08:51.040 --> 08:54.761
as accidents do happen
more and more these days...

08:55.640 --> 08:58.849
You should feel free to take it
to your friend Mr Ogilvey.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.606
Why should an accident happen, madam?

09:01.680 --> 09:03.523
Are you concerned for your safety?

09:03.600 --> 09:04.840
No.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.010
But I see that you are.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.766
Thank you.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.248
Have you always been the night manager?

09:17.320 --> 09:19.561
It's my profession, yes.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.291
- You chose it?
- I think it chose me.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.407
It's a shame.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.764
You look fine by daylight.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.926
Youssef.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.088
How are you?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.000
- Perfect.
- OK.

09:55.080 --> 09:58.243
Listen, Youssef, do you know
a man called Freddie Hamid?

09:59.320 --> 10:01.129
He's a playboy and a gambler.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.123
There's some kind of deal going on.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.449
And Freddie Hamid is involved

10:05.520 --> 10:07.966
and I have to find out
when it's happening and where.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.451
Is there anyone you know?

10:09.520 --> 10:11.761
Friends in local kitchens where he's staying?

10:11.840 --> 10:14.047
OK. But be careful, Jonathan.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.202
You don't want to get
on the wrong side of the Hamids.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.244
Youssef. Youssef.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.771
President Mubarak resigned.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.330
I think I understood that.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.446
<i>Across Egypt,
millions were on the streets</i>

10:49.520 --> 10:51.363
<i>erupting in excitement.</i>

10:51.440 --> 10:54.250
<i>"He's gone. After 30 years, gone."</i>

10:55.240 --> 10:56.969
<i>Cars honk their horns.</i>

10:57.040 --> 10:59.850
<i>It was a moment like no other in their lives.</i>

11:14.720 --> 11:16.370
<i>Ramses Hilton.</i>

11:16.440 --> 11:18.568
Yes, Corniche Bar, please.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.481
<i>- Corniche Bar, hello.</i>
- Oh, hi.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.528
Yeah. This is George Watts.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.080
I'm a mate of Freddie Hamid's.

11:27.160 --> 11:30.084
I was supposed to meet him
for cocktails in the bar tonight,

11:30.160 --> 11:31.286
but I've got held up.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.124
Do you happen to know where he is?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.680
<i>- They have already left, sir.</i>
- What a shame.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.842
Do you know where they've gone?

11:37.920 --> 11:42.050
<i>I believe Mr Roper took Mr Hamid
to dinner on his yacht, sir.</i>

11:42.120 --> 11:45.203
I'm sorry. There's a bit of a big party
going on here.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.726
I couldn't quite hear you.
Could you repeat that, please?

11:47.800 --> 11:50.644
<i>- Mr Hamid is with Mr Roper.</i>
- Mr Roper?

11:50.720 --> 11:51.926
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

11:52.680 --> 11:54.409
Thank you so much.

12:37.200 --> 12:41.888
<i>My Safe Haven project for refugees,

13:36.080 --> 13:37.605
Morning, Jonathan.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.685
Simon, I know it's early, but
I need to talk to you about something.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.330
I've been calling the embassy all morning.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.606
Come through. What is this?

13:59.920 --> 14:01.445
Bloody hell.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.084
There are enough toys here to start a war.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.528
Or crush a popular uprising.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.562
- Where did you get this?
- I found it.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.370
You found it?

14:23.440 --> 14:26.603
Say they arrived by post. Don't mention me.

14:26.680 --> 14:28.091
Anonymous sender.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.766
Jesus Christ, Jonathan.
There's bloody napalm on here.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.649
Send it today.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.407
These people aren't wasting any time.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.290
Yes.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.041
- Thank you.
- OK.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.245
Three flights up.
Lift's broken, but it keeps you fit.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.721
Yes, chicken sounds great, love.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.724
Well, a couple of days out of date
is fine if you cook it well.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.406
Yeah. All right.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.002
Yeah, see you later. Bye.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.810
They were supposed to come
yesterday to fix this.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.850
- Rob.
- Yes.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.242
Rob, come here.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.881
Rex Mayhew just sent that.
Cairo station, anonymous sender.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.131
- Ironlast?
- Yeah. He's back.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.487
Get me all the files you
can on Richard Roper.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.291
Defence, FCO, Bank of England, Treasury.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.044
HMRC. We'll need the River files, too.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.451
Red flags will fly.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.841
So bury the requests in a pile of slurry.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.400
Do a random sweep
on all Brits living offshore.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.050
Throw River House off the scent.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.327
Make us look like amateurs
looking for a needle in a haystack.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.402
- Do you think you can you do that?
- Yes.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.805
Go on, then.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.285
Good evening, Ms Alekan.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.521
Mr Pine,

17:00.600 --> 17:03.604
I would like you to bring
a scotch and soda to my room, please.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.446
I can ask room service

17:06.520 --> 17:09.364
or there should be a mini bar
just under the main wardrobe.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.442
I know where the mini bar is.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.721
I want you.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.842
Madam... Your scotch and soda.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.890
Just here on the table, madam?

17:56.320 --> 17:58.322
Who did you show the papers to?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.961
Please, just tell me, I would understand.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.004
I just need to know.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.882
Freddie Hamid was just here.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.570
He said he has just spoken
to the man from Ironlast.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.201
Which man?

18:18.360 --> 18:21.011
Richard Roper, the worst man in the world.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.806
Roper told Freddie that the deal was off.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.486
Apparently, Roper had been warned.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.480
Who by?

18:37.920 --> 18:40.446
You tell me, Mr Pine.

18:58.560 --> 19:01.564
I've left your dog with the concierge.
She'll be fine.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.281
Ms Alekan... I'm so sorry.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.445
I had no idea this would happen.

19:23.520 --> 19:27.241
Don't apologise.
You were right to do what you did.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.405
If I'd been brave enough,
I would have done it myself.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.566
But Freddie has a temper as you can see.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.171
And he may come back.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.050
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.727
Would that be you and the Queen... Mr Pine?

19:46.680 --> 19:47.761
Madam.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.402
Simon, this is Jonathan Pine.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.805
Could you give me a ring
as soon as you get this please?

20:03.880 --> 20:05.405
It's urgent. Thank you.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.926
Hey, you.
I have a friend in the Hatshepsut Suite.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.809
She's not answering. Can you try the room?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.482
Certainly, sir.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.851
I'm afraid there is no answer, sir.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.207
- Just give me the key.
- I can't do that, sir.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.681
Just give me the damn key.
Do you know who I am?

20:30.760 --> 20:32.683
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Then you know who my family are.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.683
Open the room. Open the room.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.728
- Which one?
- Sir, it is this one.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.529
Open the room, go.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.090
We go, open the room.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.331
Sir.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.527
Where is she? When did you last see her?

20:50.600 --> 20:52.921
Last night. I can ask the day staff.

20:54.400 --> 20:55.845
Shit!

21:12.000 --> 21:13.570
Excuse me, sir?

21:17.200 --> 21:18.565
Ah.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.570
Mr Roper. Yes, sir.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.008
I'm dealing with it. I have it all in hand.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.040
Yes, sir.

21:35.200 --> 21:38.044
The minute she appears, you call this number.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.927
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.331
Sir, certainly, sir.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.171
It belongs to
an archaeologist friend of mine.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.730
It's an hour outside the city.

22:12.800 --> 22:15.087
He's gone back to London tonight.
It will be empty for two weeks

22:15.160 --> 22:17.049
and I really think it's the safest option.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.086
Come with me.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.926
Please.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.688
Youssef, tell no one we are here,
not even your family.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.444
- OK.
- Thank you, brother.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.921
No worries. Let me know if you
need anything else, OK?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.081
- OK.
- All right.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.084
It's not much, but...

23:39.360 --> 23:40.885
It will do.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.689
Why do you sit so far away?

24:11.920 --> 24:13.649
Out of respect, I suppose.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.529
Is that why you came all the way here?

24:16.360 --> 24:17.771
To respect me?

24:19.680 --> 24:22.524
You have many different voices, Mr Pine.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.162
You say one thing and...

24:25.960 --> 24:27.689
That person touches me.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.845
And that person is called away
and somebody quite different takes his place.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.328
We have a changing of the guard.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.128
Are you like this with all your women?

24:41.200 --> 24:43.009
Hmm...

24:43.080 --> 24:46.163
You're not...
You're not one of my women, Miss Sophie.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.204
So why are you here?

24:57.160 --> 25:00.687
I want one of your many selves...

25:01.800 --> 25:03.802
to sleep with me tonight.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.805
You can choose which one.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.440
Sophie is the name you
gave yourself, isn't it?

25:54.520 --> 25:57.364
Yes. In Paris.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.403
I wanted to be more western.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.605
What's your real name?

26:10.080 --> 26:11.730
Samira.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.411
Samira.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.444
What more do you want?
You sent me those papers.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.409
There isn't another RM in the Foreign Office

26:31.480 --> 26:34.006
sending me top-secret files
with private courier.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.242
I sent them to you as information

26:36.320 --> 26:37.731
as I do to everyone in Arms and Intelligence.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.882
- I was transparent.
- Yeah, and while you're at it,

26:40.960 --> 26:43.327
you set me up in a transparent
shoe box in Victoria

26:43.400 --> 26:45.004
with no cash and no heating.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.287
- Angela...
- Rex...

26:47.360 --> 26:49.124
Richard Roper is selling arms

26:49.200 --> 26:51.521
to the youngest Hamid brother
in the heart of Cairo

26:51.600 --> 26:53.682
in the middle of what we hope
is the Arab Spring.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.485
- Isn't that exactly what we are looking for?
- Keep your voice down.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.811
The Permanent Secretary has a view,
which I share,

26:59.880 --> 27:02.281
that if you are allowed to continue unchecked

27:02.360 --> 27:04.442
in your usual headstrong fashion

27:04.520 --> 27:06.568
against Richard Onslow Roper,

27:06.640 --> 27:08.847
without so much as a nod to our friends
across the river...

27:08.920 --> 27:10.922
Yeah, something might actually get done.
That's it, isn't it?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.082
There is another point of view on all this.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.481
- Which is what?
- That arming certain key players

27:15.560 --> 27:17.608
whose mobile phone numbers
we happen to have in our address book

27:17.680 --> 27:21.162
might be preferable to indulging
a whole new bunch

27:21.240 --> 27:23.049
of religious lunatics
about whom we know nothing.

27:23.120 --> 27:25.043
Oh, yeah. So instead of putting
handcuffs on him,

27:25.120 --> 27:26.963
we give him a seat in the House of Lords.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.045
The joint Intelligence Committee
will meet next week.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.249
We'll have a full and frank discussion.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.722
We will share our intelligence
like brothers and sisters.

27:39.360 --> 27:43.251
And we will pursue,
not our hopes and dreams, alas,

27:43.320 --> 27:45.766
but the art of the possible.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.525
Now, I have to be at my club in 15 minutes.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.284
I would invite you, but...

27:50.360 --> 27:52.806
I'm obliged to observe club rules.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.484
I urge you to do the same.

27:54.560 --> 27:57.564
Can't believe you're still a member of a club
that won't allow women.

27:57.800 --> 28:00.929
Have a lovely time.
Apparently, the food's shit.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.085
Did you ever meet Richard Roper?

28:11.400 --> 28:13.641
I saw him at a few parties. Why?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.321
What's he like?

28:17.800 --> 28:19.165
Very charming.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.202
Why do you call him
"the worst man in the world"?

28:27.000 --> 28:30.641
Because he sells destruction,
pain and death and...

28:31.680 --> 28:32.806
He laughs.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.531
What is it?

28:54.680 --> 28:55.841
Urn...

28:55.920 --> 28:57.809
I think you have to leave the country.

28:59.160 --> 29:00.491
I have nowhere to go.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.485
You could go to England.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.365
Will you help me?

29:12.200 --> 29:13.565
Of course I will.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.768
- There you are.
- Thanks for coming.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.763
- Drink?
- Not here.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.080
OK.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.047
You know, Jonathan, they are...

30:06.880 --> 30:08.848
They are very pleased with what you found.

30:08.920 --> 30:12.208
Well, if they are so pleased,
how come they tipped off Richard Roper?

30:12.920 --> 30:15.491
- What are you talking about?
- Someone in London tipped off Roper.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.322
My source had her face smashed up
in a hotel room by Freddie Hamid.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.965
Are you telling me your source
is Freddie Hamid's whore?

30:28.800 --> 30:30.040
Where is she now?

30:31.440 --> 30:32.601
She's somewhere safe.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.490
OK. Well, wherever you've hidden her,
that's a temporary solution. Yes?

30:35.560 --> 30:37.164
- Yes. Of course.
- So, what are you planning?

30:38.160 --> 30:40.003
I'm planning to get her out of the country.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.809
- Uh-huh, where to?
- Where do you think, Simon?

30:41.920 --> 30:45.845
Jonathan, if you think the British government
is gonna give safe haven to Hamid's tart,

30:45.920 --> 30:47.001
think again.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.127
Excuse me?

30:48.840 --> 30:51.127
The British government
have a responsibility...

30:51.200 --> 30:53.362
The Hamid family have invested
over a billion dollars in Britain

30:53.440 --> 30:54.885
in the last five years.

30:54.960 --> 30:57.281
They're having hotels built in London,
Manchester.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.204
They fund political parties,
they're at every top table you can name.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.681
You think your girl is safe in London?

31:03.120 --> 31:06.681
Freddie Hamid has more friends in London
than you and I put together, she has none.

31:06.760 --> 31:11.084
She gave us vital intelligence
that can save lives.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.730
This wasn't a business transaction.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.406
This was a humanitarian act.
We have a duty of care.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.010
I'm advising you, Jonathan...

31:19.040 --> 31:20.804
You fly that girl out,

31:20.880 --> 31:23.201
it is a confession of her guilt.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.923
Freddie Hamid will know it was her.
So will Richard Roper.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.208
And no one will lift a finger to stop them.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.810
She needs to convince Hamid
she knows nothing.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.484
That is her only chance.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.330
Yes?

32:04.760 --> 32:06.364
<i>Sophie, it's me.</i>

32:06.440 --> 32:08.488
Oh, Jonathan.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.166
I miss you so much.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.800
<i>Jonathan?</i>

32:19.120 --> 32:20.565
Yes. Um...

32:22.920 --> 32:23.967
Look...

32:25.400 --> 32:26.640
Yes?

32:27.880 --> 32:30.087
London is not an option.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.600
<i>It's all gonna be fine.</i>

32:33.680 --> 32:36.445
<i>You just have to give me some more time.
That's all.</i>

32:37.800 --> 32:41.361
There we have it. The changing of the guards.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.046
No, no, no. Nothing has changed.
It's all still the same.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.531
It's... I'll find a way.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.090
<i>I promise.</i>

33:12.480 --> 33:13.686
Thank you.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.724
MY key, please.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.169
Ms Alekan, if Mr Hamid...

33:35.240 --> 33:36.651
just my key. Thank you.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.526
And tell the concierge
to bring my dog to my room.

34:02.240 --> 34:04.527
- What have you got?
- Not a lot.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.729
Roper's careful who he talks to.
GCHQ have nothing but dross.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.130
It's always the same.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.884
His name is not on a single thing.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.882
There's not a single register
at Companies House.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.803
Not one email. Not even a text.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.848
I bet his fingers don't have prints.

34:19.320 --> 34:20.731
Rob Singh, IEA.

34:24.320 --> 34:27.244
I see. Would you want to
speak to her yourself?

34:27.320 --> 34:28.525
Yeah, yeah.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.246
I can tell her.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.928
The JIC meeting has been cancelled.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.764
Cancelled? What do you mean cancelled?

34:38.840 --> 34:40.808
Apparently there are political reasons

34:40.880 --> 34:42.962
why an inquiry into the Cairo papers

34:43.040 --> 34:45.088
will not be productive at this time.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.565
- Get Mayhew's office on the phone.
- That was Mayhew's office.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.726
Roper.

34:54.400 --> 34:58.121
- Who sent the Cairo papers?
- Station officer, name of...

34:58.200 --> 35:00.202
- Ogilvey.
- Simon Ogilvey?

35:00.280 --> 35:01.327
Yes.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.771
He was my leg man in Kiev, 2004.
Get him on the phone.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.889
Nefertiti Hotel, Cairo.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.450
<i>Is that the night manager?</i>

35:22.520 --> 35:24.204
Yes. Who's speaking, please?

35:24.280 --> 35:26.521
<i>You have a guest in the Hatshepsut Suite.</i>

35:26.600 --> 35:28.284
<i>She needs to leave the hotel immediately.</i>

35:28.360 --> 35:30.044
<i>Call me when she is safe.</i>

35:30.120 --> 35:32.691
<i>44-700-70-70-70.</i>

35:32.760 --> 35:35.411
- Who is this, please?
<i>- My name is Angela Burr.</i>

35:35.480 --> 35:37.642
<i>- I'm a friend.</i>
- What do you mean, "a friend"?

35:37.760 --> 35:40.286
Just get her out, Mr Pine.
Her life is at risk.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.885
Oh, God.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.406
Sophie?

36:29.320 --> 36:30.446
No!

37:22.800 --> 37:24.290
She was a guest at the hotel.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.681
I think she was connected to Freddie Hamid.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.244
- Who?
- Freddie Hamid.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.281
Freddie Hamid.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.609
You must know him, the Hamids?

37:35.200 --> 37:37.521
- I don't know him.
- How can you not know him?

37:37.600 --> 37:39.364
They're one of the most famous
families in the city.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.442
No. Was burglar.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.049
- Crazy burglar.
- What are you talking about?

37:44.120 --> 37:45.804
- Why would a burglar do that?
- What do you care?

37:47.080 --> 37:48.491
Maybe you know her better than you say?

37:50.120 --> 37:51.531
Maybe you kill her.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.370
- Good evening, Herr Strippli.
- Mr Pine.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.531
Good evening, Fräulein Vipp.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.886
<i>Guten abend,</i> Herr Pine.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.689
Herr Strippli, you should have gone by now.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.328
A late booking came in.
I had to arrange their requirements.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.607
Private jet landing in Dubendorf.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.445
- I'm sending a helicopter to pick them up.
- Hmm.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.886
You know of him?

40:04.200 --> 40:08.205
He used to come every year,
but that was long before your time.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.690
And this parcel came for them.

40:10.760 --> 40:13.445
Please give it to them when they arrive.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.411
Good night, Mr Pine.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.205
<i>Gute nacht.</i>

40:46.240 --> 40:47.401
Thank you!

40:52.520 --> 40:55.285
- Very nicely clone, may I say.
- Thank you.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.850
That was very elegant.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.800
So pleasing to wake up the fucking Germans.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.010
Welcome to Zermatt, sir.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.930
I'm Dickie Roper.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.287
My chaps have booked some rooms here.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.521
Quite a lot of them, actually.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.329
Very good to see you, Mr Roper.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.131
My name's Pine. I'm the night manager.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.885
I do hope your journey wasn't too ghastly.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.762
So... Where's old Meister?

41:34.840 --> 41:36.001
Freezing.

41:36.120 --> 41:39.647
Tucked up in bed, is he, with an Ovaltine or...
German porn?

41:41.760 --> 41:44.331
How are you getting on with those magazines,
Jed, darling?

41:44.400 --> 41:45.561
Just fine, darling.

41:46.280 --> 41:50.126
Herr Meister is
unavoidably tied up tonight, I'm afraid.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.770
He asked me to show you the rooms.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.810
But he does enormously look forward
to seeing you in the morning

41:54.880 --> 41:57.087
when you are rested from the journey.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.811
- You English, Pine?
- To the core, sir.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.680
Wise man.

42:02.160 --> 42:05.369
Corky, you proposing marriage to
that young lady?

42:05.440 --> 42:07.044
Highly bloody unlikely.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.451
Nearly there, chief.

42:08.520 --> 42:11.763
I'm terribly sorry about that.
It's the new security, I'm afraid.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.844
The Swiss police insist.
There seems to be nothing we can do.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.160
Have you been here long?

42:16.840 --> 42:18.968
Weren't here last time we came,
was he, Frisky?

42:19.040 --> 42:20.451
No, he wasn't.

42:20.520 --> 42:23.046
I've been here for two-and-a-half years, sir.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.565
Before that?

42:26.200 --> 42:29.170
I was in Italy, and before that, Tangier.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.280
- All done.
- About bloody time.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.089
Whatever happened to your signing hand?

42:36.160 --> 42:39.130
- Wanker's colic, chief.
- Limp wrist, more like.

42:39.200 --> 42:40.440
Your key, sir.

42:40.520 --> 42:43.171
This is one of Herr
Meister's new innovations.

42:43.240 --> 42:44.969
It's a little <i>outré</i>, I confess,

42:45.040 --> 42:47.566
but our less sophisticated guests adore it.

42:47.640 --> 42:50.530
Well, I adore it, and I'm
bloody sophisticated.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.284
"Taiwan."

42:52.800 --> 42:54.404
Tabby.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.047
- How was the ride in, sir?
- Noisy.

43:01.640 --> 43:04.883
It can be terribly bumpy up there
even on a clear night.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.166
Heroic of you to venture aloft at all,
if you ask me.

43:09.720 --> 43:12.087
And you, ma'am?
Are you feeling all right, ma'am?

43:12.160 --> 43:13.446
Fine, thank you.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.568
You're made of sterner stuff than I am.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.806
- Champagne, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.531
Gregory, listen to me.
All we need is delivery by Tuesday.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.602
So, tell your friends by the Vltava

43:36.680 --> 43:39.763
that they need to start driving
tomorrow morning.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.844
This room is probably exactly as
you remember it, sir.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.526
Although, the bathrooms have been
completely refurbished.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.329
There is a new free-standing tub,

43:47.400 --> 43:49.641
mini spa facilities, and a jacuzzi.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.529
- I'm gonna take a bath, baby.
- All right.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.086
Pretty, isn't she?

44:12.920 --> 44:15.685
I went to New York to buy a painting.
Came back with her.

44:15.760 --> 44:17.922
Liar. You said you were buying a horse.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.684
It's a painting of a horse.

44:27.880 --> 44:30.042
Sandy, you coming to bed?

44:30.120 --> 44:33.010
This is Lady Langbourne,
best skier within 100 miles.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.127
I guarantee it.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.680
- Once upon a time.
- Knees gone, poor old thing.

44:36.760 --> 44:37.807
Completely worn out.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.129
Good night, my beloved.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.328
Soldier Boris says,
"OK, Monday lunchtime."

44:44.400 --> 44:45.686
OK, Monday lunchtime?

44:45.760 --> 44:48.525
Fix. Aren't we getting rid of these?

44:48.600 --> 44:50.090
They were supposed to be here by 6:00.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.606
Did anything come, Pine? Package for us?

44:52.680 --> 44:54.921
Nothing that I've seen, sir.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.525
I'll chase it for you.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.365
Your friend Apostol says he can meet you
in town tomorrow night.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.124
Too public. Make it here.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.490
Play golf, do we, sweetheart?

45:06.560 --> 45:08.847
- No, sir, I don't.
- Me neither.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.763
Just the 19th hole.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.362
Darling, some more shampoo, please?

45:14.440 --> 45:16.283
She means the...

45:17.320 --> 45:19.687
Take it in to her, will you, old boy?

45:28.640 --> 45:30.802
- Certainly, sir.
- Only joking.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.521
Although...

45:34.600 --> 45:36.967
I think we might need
another couple of bottles of this stuff.

45:38.520 --> 45:40.488
Of course, sir, absolutely. Right away.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.291
And find out what happened
to that bloody parcel, will you?

45:43.360 --> 45:45.567
Yes, sir. I'll have it sent up
as soon as it arrives.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.841
Can I see tonight's late arrivals, please?

46:10.920 --> 46:12.570
Yes.

46:12.640 --> 46:15.769
- Just a second. Here they are.
- Thank you.

46:24.680 --> 46:27.490
Could you do photocopies of these,
please, for me, Fräulein?

46:27.560 --> 46:29.847
We're doing a marketing survey
of the Tower Suite guests.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.968
- Yes, of course, Mr Pine.
- Thank you.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.650
Ah, Alfred, could you deliver this
to Mr Roper?

47:17.080 --> 47:18.127
Also, one more thing.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.680
Please don't forget to empty the rubbish
from their bins right away.

47:20.760 --> 47:22.046
- Mr Roper hates mess.
- Of course.

47:22.120 --> 47:23.167
Thanks.

47:44.520 --> 47:45.726
Can I help you, madam?

47:47.600 --> 47:49.523
Do you really stay awake all night?

47:51.160 --> 47:52.525
Yes, madam.

47:53.200 --> 47:54.247
It's my job.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.080
Is the pool open?

48:01.040 --> 48:02.565
Give me one moment, please.

49:12.600 --> 49:14.090
Can I help you, gentlemen?

49:14.640 --> 49:17.120
- Is the bar still open?
- Yes, of course, sir.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.931
- Ah, perfect.
- Allow me to escort you.

49:26.160 --> 49:27.286
Thank you.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.450
Yes, hello, could I speak
to Angela Burr, please?

51:10.640 --> 51:12.529
<i>My name is Jonathan Pine.</i>

51:31.400 --> 51:33.482
- Hi. How are you?
- Good evening.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.005
- Good to see you.
- Me, too.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.048
Are you well? Hi, I'm Jed.

51:37.120 --> 51:40.408
- Nice to meet you.
- Apo. How are you? You look well.

51:40.480 --> 51:41.811
- You, too.
- Thank you.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.850
- This is Mercedes.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

51:44.920 --> 51:46.570
- She has never been to Zermatt before.
- Uh-huh.

51:46.640 --> 51:49.371
And I said, "You have to come."

51:49.440 --> 51:52.046
The air, the beauty.
And what does she do?

51:52.120 --> 51:55.124
Moans all the way,
the whole way up the mountain!

51:55.200 --> 51:57.521
I hate the cold.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.442
- How's school?
- Fine.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.366
I know what you're thinking.

52:03.440 --> 52:05.329
Which is the daughter
and which is the mistress?

52:05.400 --> 52:07.846
The young beauties will
be leaving us in a moment.

52:07.920 --> 52:10.207
Make sure they are
well serviced in the lounge.

52:10.280 --> 52:12.408
Trust that won't be too painful for you.

52:15.320 --> 52:16.321
Ladies...

52:18.880 --> 52:20.086
Come.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.050
- Apo?
- Yes.

52:27.120 --> 52:30.169
I have received an offer. Combine harvesters.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.049
Sometime in the next six months.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.485
Looking for interested buyers.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.850
Glimpse of the infinite.

52:57.840 --> 53:01.049
- Yes, it's reassuring.
- Up to a point.

53:02.800 --> 53:05.485
- You work here all year?
- Indeed, sir.

53:06.640 --> 53:08.244
I don't think I could do that.

53:08.320 --> 53:09.970
Too bloody quiet for me.

53:10.160 --> 53:12.083
Get used to it eventually.

53:13.840 --> 53:16.491
Keeping away from the world, are we?
Got a girl?

53:17.880 --> 53:19.882
- No, sir.
- All alone.

53:21.240 --> 53:22.571
I suppose we all are in the end, aren't we?

53:26.680 --> 53:30.002
You know, a lot of people would
have tossed that cigarette away

53:30.080 --> 53:32.082
when a paying customer turned up.

53:33.240 --> 53:34.571
Good for you.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.410
We leave tomorrow, so until the next time...

53:40.800 --> 53:42.848
<i>- Adios!</i>
- Good night, sir.

54:34.880 --> 54:36.609
- Angela Burr?
- Yes.

54:36.680 --> 54:38.762
- Jonathan Pine.
- Nice to meet you.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.246
<i>Danke.</i>

54:44.720 --> 54:46.210
Thank you for coming all this way.

54:46.280 --> 54:47.611
- I appreciate it.
- Pleasure.

54:56.280 --> 54:57.441
These are for you.

55:04.080 --> 55:06.765
Richard Roper was recently a guest
at the Meisters Hotel.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.842
Do whatever you want with those.
I don't want to be involved.

55:18.920 --> 55:20.331
Thank you.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.129
So, why did you do it?

55:25.320 --> 55:28.130
Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier,

55:28.200 --> 55:30.601
risk his career by snitching on his guests?

55:30.680 --> 55:31.886
First in Cairo, and then here.

55:33.400 --> 55:36.051
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

55:40.040 --> 55:42.441
- Something stirred, I suppose.
- What stirred?

55:42.520 --> 55:47.048
Listen. If there's a man selling
a private arsenal to an Egyptian crook,

55:47.120 --> 55:50.203
and he is English, and you're English,

55:50.320 --> 55:53.847
and those weapons can cause a lot of pain
to a lot of people...

55:54.640 --> 55:56.165
Then you just do it.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.090
Anyone would do it.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.481
Plenty wouldn't.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.089
You were a soldier yourself, of course.

56:08.840 --> 56:12.606
- Yes, I was.
- Iraq. Two tours.

56:14.080 --> 56:15.969
You know what those weapons
can do to a body.

56:18.880 --> 56:20.803
I saw things in Iraq that didn't line up

56:20.880 --> 56:22.769
with my idea of what it
means to be a soldier.

56:24.920 --> 56:27.685
And then there's Sophie Alekan, your Sophie.

56:28.520 --> 56:29.965
She wasn't my Sophie.

56:33.360 --> 56:34.407
Mr Pine...

56:36.240 --> 56:38.971
What happened to Sophie Alekan
makes us all involved.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.760
What happened in Cairo

56:45.840 --> 56:47.808
shames me to the bottom of my soul.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.331
I know you can't forgive
the man who did that.

56:51.400 --> 56:54.768
The question is,
what are you prepared to do about it?

56:57.500 --> 57:05.500
