00:14.927 --> 00:16.628
No more, mom.
Come on, come on.

00:16.696 --> 00:18.463
I mean, that is like
your third memory card.

00:18.531 --> 00:20.766
Sorry. It's just
that I remember my prom.

00:20.833 --> 00:23.802
So much joy, so much passion.

00:23.870 --> 00:26.104
The best night of our lives,
remember, dear?

00:26.172 --> 00:28.840
You didn't go with me!

00:28.908 --> 00:31.076
Oh. Right.

00:32.712 --> 00:34.746
Ok, I'm late.
Now I gotta go!

00:41.954 --> 00:44.022
Thanks for coming
with me, Randy.

00:44.090 --> 00:45.824
Can I make a little confession?

00:45.892 --> 00:48.026
This isn't my first prom.

00:48.094 --> 00:49.594
Well,
what do you mean?

00:49.662 --> 00:50.962
Were you held back?

00:51.030 --> 00:55.801
No. At my other schools, I
went to prom with other boys.

00:55.868 --> 00:59.905
Look, I just want to party Hardy,
get my swerve on, you know.

00:59.972 --> 01:02.774
I just want you to know
that I think you're the one.

01:02.842 --> 01:04.775
Are you, Randy?

01:06.145 --> 01:07.946
Are you the one?

01:09.315 --> 01:11.083
What?!

01:11.150 --> 01:13.351
Be my boyfriend, Randy.

01:13.419 --> 01:17.155
Forever and ever and ever!

01:52.091 --> 01:54.726
Scooby Dooby Doo!

02:04.837 --> 02:06.571
Suck on that, suckers.

02:08.174 --> 02:12.544
But don't forget that this weekend
is our annual Van-Ghoulathon.

02:12.612 --> 02:17.783
405 Vincent Van Gogh classics
without commercials.

02:17.850 --> 02:19.384
Oh, boy, oh, boy, Scoob!

02:19.452 --> 02:21.353
Like, this year's Van-Ghoulathon
sounds great!

02:21.420 --> 02:22.921
Yeah!

02:22.989 --> 02:26.191
Just eating and Van Gogh,
eating and Van Gogh!

02:26.259 --> 02:28.760
For a whole week, yippee!

02:28.828 --> 02:31.630
Yeah, yippee.

02:32.665 --> 02:34.266
Ah, like, hey, Scoob.

02:34.333 --> 02:37.035
All this marathon talk
is getting me kinda hungry.

02:37.103 --> 02:38.670
Mmm, I'm on it.

02:38.738 --> 02:40.639
Scooby Dooby Doo!

02:42.675 --> 02:44.776
Like, what gives, Velm?
You love the marathon.

02:44.844 --> 02:46.411
That was last year.

02:46.479 --> 02:49.414
This year, the marathon falls
on our one month anniversary,

02:49.482 --> 02:51.550
and the prom.

02:51.617 --> 02:53.718
Fortunately, I think I have
the perfect solution.

02:53.786 --> 02:56.421
Gulp! Like,
am I going to like it?

02:56.489 --> 02:58.924
We'll have our official coming
out as a couple at the prom.

02:58.991 --> 03:03.128
Then celebrate by watching the marathon...
alone. Just us.

03:03.196 --> 03:05.397
Oh, boy.

03:11.037 --> 03:12.804
Gee, look at that.

03:12.872 --> 03:15.507
I guess prom is coming up.
Any plans?

03:15.575 --> 03:17.442
I'll probably do the same
thing I do every year...

03:17.510 --> 03:19.611
monitor my police scanner
and patrol the sewers.

03:19.679 --> 03:20.946
You gonna go?

03:21.013 --> 03:23.782
I don't know.
I guess if someone asks me.

03:23.850 --> 03:25.784
Gotcha. Well,
good luck with that!

03:25.852 --> 03:27.118
Huh?!

03:28.387 --> 03:29.855
Oh, buttercups.

03:29.922 --> 03:31.623
Come on, open.

03:31.691 --> 03:34.526
Let me try. These are
series s geyser tumblers.

03:34.594 --> 03:36.361
Sometimes they stick.

03:37.430 --> 03:39.497
Wow! That's amazing.

03:39.565 --> 03:42.100
Thank you so much.

03:42.168 --> 03:43.168
My name's Alice.

03:43.236 --> 03:45.871
Alice May. I'm new.

03:45.938 --> 03:47.439
Fred Jones. And this is, uh...

03:47.506 --> 03:49.808
New, huh? Well, good luck.
Come on, Fred, let's go.

03:49.876 --> 03:52.477
You know, this school
can be like a maze.

03:52.545 --> 03:54.779
I've actually made several
models of it in my spare time

03:54.847 --> 03:56.314
to chart my class route.

03:56.382 --> 03:57.883
Oh, how sweet!

03:57.950 --> 03:59.317
Thanks, Fred.

03:59.385 --> 04:02.354
Well, I think I'm going
to like it here.

04:08.294 --> 04:09.694
Just a few nights away.

04:09.762 --> 04:11.196
Don't forget to call
the limo guy.

04:11.264 --> 04:13.798
Yeah! You got it, Velm.

04:13.866 --> 04:16.935
Like, help.

04:17.003 --> 04:19.437
Where's Fred?
He said he would be here.

04:19.505 --> 04:21.673
Oh, no, he didn't!

04:21.741 --> 04:23.108
Hey, gang. This is Alice.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.410
She's new. I've been
kind of showing her around.

04:25.478 --> 04:28.346
Fred's like my white knight.

04:28.414 --> 04:31.583
- What a sweetie.
- And now, if you could all quiet down,

04:31.651 --> 04:33.351
sheriff Stone has a few words.

04:33.419 --> 04:34.853
Sheriff?
Thank you, Mayor.

04:34.921 --> 04:36.221
Thank you, thank you. Prom!

04:36.289 --> 04:37.656
Yes.

04:37.723 --> 04:41.459
Obviously, we want a safe,
enjoyable evening.

04:41.527 --> 04:43.094
As some of you might be aware,

04:43.162 --> 04:44.596
there have been several
recent reports

04:44.664 --> 04:47.565
of a phantom limousine
with a ghost girl inside,

04:47.633 --> 04:50.435
stealing young men away
into the night.

04:50.503 --> 04:52.570
It probably is part of some
arcane ritual.

04:52.638 --> 04:55.240
Because of this,
we are advising all students

04:55.308 --> 04:58.443
not to get into phantom limousines
on prom night if at all possible.

04:58.511 --> 05:00.512
That's all I've got.

05:00.579 --> 05:03.048
Jinkies.
Talk about a bad date.

05:03.115 --> 05:06.217
I'll say. Gang, I think
we've got a new mystery

05:06.285 --> 05:07.619
on our hands.

05:07.687 --> 05:09.621
Well, I'd better get going.

05:09.689 --> 05:12.257
Still a lot of unpacking
to do at my house.

05:12.325 --> 05:13.959
- Need a lift?
- That's ok.

05:14.026 --> 05:15.393
I like walking.

05:15.461 --> 05:17.028
It was nice meeting all of you.

05:17.096 --> 05:18.897
- Bye.
- Bye, see you.

05:18.965 --> 05:20.498
Hey, Daph, are you coming?

05:20.566 --> 05:22.133
I'm going to walk, too.

05:22.201 --> 05:24.536
Besides, I want to do some
more research on those kids

05:24.603 --> 05:26.438
who disappeared
in the Crystal Cove caves.

05:26.505 --> 05:28.273
The ones Mr. E warned us about.

05:28.341 --> 05:31.776
I hate going home...
Clueless!

05:31.844 --> 05:33.244
Hmmph!

05:46.525 --> 05:48.893
Hmm.

05:48.961 --> 05:51.029
Hmm?

05:55.968 --> 05:57.435
Weird.

05:57.503 --> 06:01.139
It's like someone has erased
everything about the missing kids.

06:04.543 --> 06:06.778
Who doesn't want you found?

06:06.846 --> 06:09.547
Huh?!

06:09.615 --> 06:10.815
Hello?

06:10.883 --> 06:13.284
Someone there?

06:13.352 --> 06:15.286
I'm still working.

06:25.765 --> 06:27.465
Oh! Who's there?

06:27.533 --> 06:29.801
Velma? Fred?

06:52.792 --> 06:55.193
Huh?!

07:02.234 --> 07:04.602
Hello?

07:07.273 --> 07:10.542
Maybe it's just
my imagination.

07:19.852 --> 07:22.053
Daphne, it's just me.

07:22.121 --> 07:24.656
I... What are you doing in here?

07:24.723 --> 07:26.057
I was using the showers.

07:26.125 --> 07:28.593
They haven't turned the water on
at my house yet.

07:28.661 --> 07:30.195
I didn't think anyone
was still at school.

07:30.262 --> 07:33.131
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

07:33.199 --> 07:34.632
No, I'm sorry.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.401
I thought I was alone, too.

07:36.469 --> 07:38.670
You must think
I'm pretty silly.

07:38.737 --> 07:41.906
What's silly about
being scared?

07:43.776 --> 07:45.577
Well, it's getting late.
I should be going home.

07:45.644 --> 07:47.679
Coming?
No, thanks.

07:47.746 --> 07:50.081
Still got some
cleaning up to do.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.660
I'm telling you,
she's up to something.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.362
Come on, Daph.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.663
So Alice was using the shower

08:17.731 --> 08:19.765
and hanging out in the school
basement late at night.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.767
Haven't we all?

08:21.835 --> 08:24.003
What if Alice is the ghost
girl the sheriff mentioned?

08:24.071 --> 08:25.204
You could be in danger, Fred.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.707
Don't you think I'd know
if she were a ghost girl?

08:27.774 --> 08:29.275
I'd be willing to bet no.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.776
Yeah, me, too!

08:30.844 --> 08:33.044
Like, what do we really know
about Alice?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.880
Besides the fact
that she's super nice,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.782
and her hair
smells like peaches,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.985
and sometimes I get lost
in her eyes, and...

08:39.052 --> 08:41.821
Fred Jones!
Do you like this girl?

08:41.888 --> 08:44.256
Wow, look at the time.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.993
You're not wearing
a watch, Freddy.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.062
Oh. Well, I better
go find one, then.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.231
You guys should
take a look at this.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.167
That boy your ghost girl grabbed
a couple of towns over?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.570
Baby, he wasn't the first.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.672
These attacks go back
to the turn of the century.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.376
Looks like your ghost girl's
building herself a man posse.

09:03.443 --> 09:04.543
Zoinks!

09:04.611 --> 09:07.713
Like, what if Fred's
her latest possum?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.615
Not on my watch.

09:09.683 --> 09:13.786
Exactly how did you get
Alice May's address again?

09:13.854 --> 09:16.122
I found it in her locker.
I noticed the combination

09:16.189 --> 09:18.257
while Fred was helping her.
Lucky, huh?

09:25.132 --> 09:27.133
Like, tell me she moved.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.368
Well, what about Freddy?

09:29.436 --> 09:30.503
I left him a message.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.605
Every minute we wait,
he could be in danger.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.076
We should split up, cover more ground.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.511
I don't think that's such a...

09:38.578 --> 09:40.112
I'll go with Scooby.
Velma, you go with Shaggy.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.049
Sounds good to me.

09:47.954 --> 09:50.456
So how's it going
with the prom tickets?

09:50.524 --> 09:51.857
Prom tickets, ha ha.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.461
Like, yeah. Um, I gotta do that.

09:55.529 --> 09:57.596
What about the limo?
And my corsage.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.331
Your tux?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.068
Do you not want to go
to the prom with me?

10:02.135 --> 10:03.502
If you don't want to go,
just tell me.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.071
I'll understand.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.305
Oh, ha ha.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.973
What a relief!

10:08.041 --> 10:11.243
Because I don't...
What? Why?!

10:11.311 --> 10:12.745
I don't believe this!

10:12.813 --> 10:15.247
I knew it, I knew it,
I knew it!

10:15.315 --> 10:16.882
Velma, stop breaking
the cemetery!

10:16.950 --> 10:18.584
I was just kidding!

10:18.652 --> 10:20.419
Of course I want to go.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.621
You do?

10:22.689 --> 10:23.689
- Oh!
- Shaggy!

10:23.757 --> 10:26.025
We're going to have such
a wonderful evening!

10:29.162 --> 10:32.465
Keep your eyes peeled
for anything suspicious, Scooby.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.200
Ok.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.308
- Did you hear something?
- Uh-uh.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.981
That time I heard it. Uh-oh.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.723
That scream sounded like
Scooby Doo!

10:57.791 --> 10:59.792
And Daphne! Come on.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.628
Daphne, what...
Why did you scream?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.430
That's why!

11:16.510 --> 11:18.410
In there!

11:22.349 --> 11:26.552
Like, if that was Alice May, she
needs some serious moisturizer!

11:26.620 --> 11:27.720
Where are we?

11:27.787 --> 11:29.121
"Carlswell."

11:29.189 --> 11:30.489
Carlswell?

11:30.557 --> 11:33.526
That's the creeper!
The creeper?

11:33.593 --> 11:36.262
Deacon Carlswell,
alias "the creeper."

11:36.329 --> 11:37.897
I remember him.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.866
He was robbing banks
disguised as a phantom.

11:42.035 --> 11:46.372
But in reality, he was
actually the bank manager.

11:48.275 --> 11:52.478
Hold on. Isn't Carlswell still in jail...
Alive?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.981
Hmm?

11:58.318 --> 12:01.220
This is part of the creeper's
old costume.

12:01.288 --> 12:05.324
And look at this...
a transfer slip from Crystal Cove High.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.992
Ah, zoinks!

12:07.060 --> 12:08.727
Oh! She's back!

12:10.297 --> 12:11.730
We are doomed!

12:11.798 --> 12:14.567
Hey, gang.
What are you doing in here?

12:14.634 --> 12:15.734
Fred!

12:15.802 --> 12:17.469
Wow. This is a neat mausoleum.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.438
Fred! You're safe!

12:19.506 --> 12:23.209
I'm not sure how to say this,
but Alice May is a ghost.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.911
She wants to put you in her...
Man posse!

12:25.979 --> 12:27.313
What are you talking about?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.215
Gang, tell him!

12:30.717 --> 12:32.718
Why aren't you saying anything?

12:32.786 --> 12:35.955
Um, like, it's hard to say
who attacked us.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.523
It could have been Alice May's

12:37.591 --> 12:39.625
really sundried
great grandmother.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.594
Velma, Scooby?

12:41.661 --> 12:44.129
I'm sorry, Daph,
I'm just not sure.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.431
Me, neither!

12:45.498 --> 12:47.700
I think I know
what this is about.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.934
You do?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.970
You found out Alice
has asked me to the prom,

12:51.037 --> 12:53.872
and you think it's going
to affect our friendship.

12:53.940 --> 12:58.911
You...You're going to the prom...
With Alice?

13:40.098 --> 13:43.501
This was supposed to be the
greatest night of our lives.

13:43.569 --> 13:45.370
Hey, baby sis.

13:45.437 --> 13:46.804
Something got you down?

13:46.872 --> 13:49.841
Hey, Delilah.
It's ok, I'm fine.

13:49.908 --> 13:51.743
No. Now, I can tell.

13:51.810 --> 13:53.344
The same way I can tell
when I look into the eyes

13:53.412 --> 13:55.279
of the enemy and see
their cold, gray heart.

13:55.347 --> 13:57.915
No, it's either me or them.

13:57.983 --> 13:59.684
Uh, ok.

13:59.752 --> 14:01.252
Ah, boy trouble.

14:01.320 --> 14:04.022
I've been
fear's bunkmate before.

14:04.089 --> 14:05.189
Let me tell you a story.

14:05.257 --> 14:07.892
There was a beach.
Enemy dug in along the shore.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.060
They picked us up one by one,

14:09.128 --> 14:10.795
but I knew I had to get
my men through.

14:10.863 --> 14:13.031
Understand?
No.

14:13.098 --> 14:16.067
All right, here's another story...
delilah, really, don't worry.

14:16.135 --> 14:17.969
I'm gonna figure this out.

14:18.037 --> 14:19.037
I hear ya.

14:19.104 --> 14:20.738
Call if you need me.

14:20.806 --> 14:22.473
Hooyah!

14:22.541 --> 14:24.409
Wait a second.

14:24.476 --> 14:26.911
Was she trying to tell me
that Alice May is the enemy,

14:26.979 --> 14:28.813
and that Fred is pinned down
on the beach,

14:28.881 --> 14:30.415
and that I can't get up
until he's safe?

14:30.482 --> 14:33.084
Or is Fred the beach,
and I'm the one pinned down?!

14:33.152 --> 14:34.452
Or are we both the beach?

14:34.520 --> 14:35.887
It doesn't matter.

14:35.954 --> 14:37.855
Because I understand!

14:37.923 --> 14:40.591
I think.

14:41.894 --> 14:43.795
Hmm.

14:43.862 --> 14:45.963
Fred, Fred!

14:46.031 --> 14:49.267
Daphne! What are you...
you can't go to the prom with Alice May.

14:49.334 --> 14:51.402
It's too late.
I've already plotted our route.

14:51.470 --> 14:54.272
Listen to me. I've dreamt
of this night my whole life.

14:54.339 --> 14:58.576
And every time I've had
that dream, you're in it.

15:03.382 --> 15:05.083
Fred!

15:05.150 --> 15:09.120
All set? Um...
Please, Fred, this is your last chance.

15:10.189 --> 15:12.156
Ah, what the heck.

15:12.224 --> 15:13.357
Going to the prom with a friend

15:13.425 --> 15:15.259
will be more fun than a date
anyway, right?

15:15.327 --> 15:17.862
Ah, I'll take what I can get.

15:17.930 --> 15:19.730
Hmm! Hmm.

15:19.798 --> 15:21.766
Hey, Alice.
I hope you don't mind,

15:21.834 --> 15:23.134
but I can't go
to the prom with you.

15:23.202 --> 15:25.770
It's nothing personal,
but Daphne and I...

15:28.107 --> 15:29.807
Ok, then.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.576
Thanks for understanding.

15:31.643 --> 15:33.311
Oh, I understand.

15:33.378 --> 15:34.946
And you will, too.

15:35.013 --> 15:36.914
Soon enough.

15:36.982 --> 15:40.618
Time to slice up
some fresh bacon.

15:46.992 --> 15:48.693
This is great!

15:48.760 --> 15:52.029
Hey, what's wrong?
Not hungry?

15:52.097 --> 15:54.799
Gee, not right now,
Scoob. Ahh!

15:54.867 --> 15:57.235
What am I saying? I'm starved.
Oh, look, we're out of sardines.

15:57.302 --> 15:59.303
I'll just run to the store
and get some!

15:59.371 --> 16:01.139
Huh?

16:01.206 --> 16:02.273
Huh.

16:02.341 --> 16:03.774
Huh!

16:03.842 --> 16:05.543
Raggy, wait!

16:05.611 --> 16:07.211
Shaggy, is that you?

16:07.279 --> 16:09.647
Yep! Let's go!
I'm in my pants.

16:09.715 --> 16:11.215
Whoa!

16:15.187 --> 16:16.387
Huh?

16:16.455 --> 16:18.322
Oh, no, there's the ghost girl!

16:18.390 --> 16:20.124
She's got Raggy!

16:20.192 --> 16:22.059
Raggy!

16:25.898 --> 16:27.999
Jinkies. There's no parking.

16:28.066 --> 16:30.501
Driver, try around back.

16:39.444 --> 16:41.412
Raggy!

16:45.284 --> 16:48.653
Hey, Daph,
what's with your face?

16:48.720 --> 16:50.354
You ok? You look like
you're gonna hork.

16:50.422 --> 16:52.256
This is exactly like my dream.

16:52.324 --> 16:54.492
Us, dancing.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.727
Then after, we take a walk
in the moonlight,

16:56.795 --> 16:58.663
and you whisper in my ear.

16:58.730 --> 17:01.299
- Scooby!
- Yeah. What?!

17:01.366 --> 17:03.501
No!
Danger!

17:03.569 --> 17:05.736
- Ghost girl!
- Ghost girl?

17:07.406 --> 17:10.907
I hope you saved a
dance for me, Fred!

17:14.846 --> 17:16.814
Let's get out of here!

17:20.419 --> 17:21.719
Like, wow. Ha!

17:21.787 --> 17:25.589
I didn't know this year's prom
theme was terror and pandemonium.

17:25.656 --> 17:26.857
What's going on?

17:26.925 --> 17:28.926
Somebody's mom is trying
to kill Fred.

17:28.994 --> 17:32.230
Yeah, thanks, mystery geeks,
for wrecking our prom!

17:32.297 --> 17:34.899
Shaggy, you're all right!

17:36.868 --> 17:37.969
What are you wearing?

17:38.036 --> 17:40.104
Like, um...

17:40.172 --> 17:42.440
Explain later! Run!

17:45.444 --> 17:46.911
Like, they're all locked!

17:46.979 --> 17:48.512
Hold on. I got an idea.

17:48.580 --> 17:51.048
Hey, isn't that Alice's locker?

17:51.116 --> 17:54.318
Yep. And this is the key
to the basement.

17:59.725 --> 18:02.293
Whew, she's gone.

18:02.361 --> 18:04.528
Hey, you guys, look at this.

18:04.596 --> 18:07.598
That's the same backpack
from the Carlswell crypt.

18:07.666 --> 18:08.966
Those are Alice's clothes.

18:09.034 --> 18:12.136
Along with Carlswell's
creeper costume.

18:12.204 --> 18:13.571
Like, man, I don't get it.

18:13.639 --> 18:16.240
Why would a ghost girl
need to change clothes?

18:16.308 --> 18:19.744
She wouldn't.
Unless she's not a real ghost.

18:19.811 --> 18:22.480
Gang, I think we're getting
close to solving this mystery.

18:22.547 --> 18:25.149
Only one thing left to do.

18:40.132 --> 18:41.265
What is this?

18:41.333 --> 18:45.169
What you wanted...
Come, one last dance.

18:45.237 --> 18:47.838
I'll destroy you all!

18:47.906 --> 18:50.107
Ahhh!
Now!

18:56.915 --> 18:58.449
Let me go!

18:58.517 --> 19:00.718
Hazy fantasie, Fred.

19:00.786 --> 19:03.187
Didn't you hear me when I said,
"if you see a ghost girl,

19:03.255 --> 19:05.923
do not go to the prom with her."

19:05.991 --> 19:08.526
Don't worry, dad.
She may look like a ghost girl,

19:08.593 --> 19:13.164
but in reality she's... Alice May.
Or she's also known as...

19:13.231 --> 19:15.066
Alice Carlswell.

19:15.133 --> 19:18.336
Carlswell? As in
Deacon Carlswell?

19:18.403 --> 19:19.570
The creeper?

19:19.638 --> 19:21.739
That's right.
He was my father.

19:21.807 --> 19:24.208
When daddy was imprisoned,
I vowed revenge

19:24.276 --> 19:25.676
on those who put him there.

19:25.744 --> 19:29.046
I used his old costume
to construct my own.

19:29.114 --> 19:31.315
When I found the legend
of the ghost girl online,

19:31.383 --> 19:33.384
I was ready to spring my trap.

19:33.452 --> 19:36.454
I grabbed that fool Randy
to throw you all off the track.

19:36.521 --> 19:38.289
And I kept him hidden and fed
in my father's crypt

19:38.357 --> 19:40.558
until I could let him go.
After that,

19:40.625 --> 19:42.259
it was just a matter
of getting rid of

19:42.327 --> 19:44.095
your precious leader, Fred.

19:44.162 --> 19:47.798
I wanted to destroy your gang the
way you destroyed my father.

19:47.866 --> 19:49.433
And I would have succeeded, too,

19:49.501 --> 19:53.437
if it weren't for you meddling...
Schoolmates...Of mine.

19:58.210 --> 20:00.644
Ah, Scooby Doo,
you gotta believe me.

20:00.712 --> 20:03.581
I wanted to watch the marathon
with you, but, like...

20:03.648 --> 20:06.317
- Uh-uh. Don't touch me.

20:06.385 --> 20:08.853
Remind me again why anyone
would want to go to the prom.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.321
Gee, I don't know.

20:10.389 --> 20:12.590
It wasn't all bad.
Right, Fred?

20:12.657 --> 20:14.859
Are you kidding?
It was awesome!

20:14.926 --> 20:16.494
- Really?
- Yeah!

20:16.561 --> 20:18.596
I mean, I came up
with that trap on the fly.

20:18.663 --> 20:20.364
Did you see how well it worked?

20:20.432 --> 20:21.665
Oh, no.

20:21.733 --> 20:24.502
The sheriff forgot to take
Alice's backpack for evidence.

20:24.569 --> 20:27.171
Sheriff!

20:27.239 --> 20:30.708
This is one of the old
Crystal Cove yearbooks.

20:30.776 --> 20:31.642
Hey, look.

20:31.710 --> 20:33.644
There's a page marked.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.848
It's them, the kids
who disappeared.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.754
Check out the caption...

20:43.822 --> 20:46.757
Brad chiles, Ricky Owens,
Cassidy Williams,

20:46.825 --> 20:49.560
Judy Reeves, and mascot
Professor Pericles,

20:49.628 --> 20:52.229
Crystal Cove High's
mystery solvers club.

20:52.297 --> 20:54.231
Mystery Incorporated.

20:54.299 --> 20:55.966
Wow. I like that name.

20:56.034 --> 20:59.069
Like, these kids were
just like us.

20:59.137 --> 21:02.306
Question is,
why did they disappear?

21:06.845 --> 21:08.479
Took you long enough.

21:08.547 --> 21:09.980
Is it taken care of?

21:10.048 --> 21:11.182
They bought the story.

21:11.249 --> 21:12.850
It'll be a couple of days
before they realize

21:12.918 --> 21:14.652
Deacon Carlswell
never had a daughter.

21:14.719 --> 21:16.787
By then, you'll be long gone.

21:16.855 --> 21:18.389
And the yearbook?

21:18.457 --> 21:20.691
In the backpack,
just like you said.

21:21.693 --> 21:23.194
Someone went to a lot of trouble

21:23.261 --> 21:25.896
to hide that yearbook before
I found it in the basement.

21:25.964 --> 21:27.364
You ever going to tell me
why you cooked up

21:27.432 --> 21:28.866
this whole Alice May scheme,

21:28.934 --> 21:32.136
just so I could then hand it over
to a bunch of kids and their dog?

21:32.204 --> 21:35.473
You were paid for a job
by my employer Mr. E.

21:35.540 --> 21:37.475
And that job is over.

21:37.542 --> 21:40.644
You don't need to know
his motives.

21:40.712 --> 21:43.247
Let's just say he needed them
to start looking into

21:43.315 --> 21:46.484
the real mystery hiding beneath
Crystal Cove;

21:46.551 --> 21:50.955
a mystery that led to the
disappearance of 4 youths.

21:51.022 --> 21:55.426
A mystery whose time
has come to be solved.
