to Nick, they're gonna do it soon,

They have money, protection.
We wouldn't stand a chance.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.803
It still doesn't mean we just
let 'em get away with it.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.480
I mean, if Nick doesn't do what
they want, they're gonna kill him.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.851
They're never just
gonna let him go.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.366

get there, the better.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.560

that really matters.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.451
Remember what I told you

24:11.520 --> 24:13.522
about the different ways
this treatment can be given?

24:13.600 --> 24:16.888
Yeah. Orally,
ointmentally...

24:16.960 --> 24:18.371
Or by shot.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.565
What about an inhalant?

24:20.640 --> 24:22.369
You mean we get 'em to smoke it?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.286
No, breathe it.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.481
That could be done.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.607
How?

24:28.800 --> 24:31.280
With the Williamson
ether synthesis.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.170
It turns a liquid into a gas.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.810
Basically,
it's an organic reaction

24:35.880 --> 24:38.611
Which forms an ether from an
organohalide and alcohol.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.811
We got the alcohol.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.803
So we just need to get them
to inhale the antidote,

24:42.880 --> 24:44.530
like nitrous oxide.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.204
We need to contain
the gas in glass bottles.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.489
Yeah, or jars or anything we
can break to release the gas.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.289
Oh! So basically,
we just create,

24:51.360 --> 24:54.250
like, a Molotov cocktail,
except it doesn't explode...

24:54.320 --> 24:55.560

this will have?

thought of that

34:13.800 --> 34:15.609
but he's had way too much of it.

34:18.679 --> 34:20.284
(INAUDIBLE WHISPERING)

34:25.560 --> 34:26.641
You're in my way.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.771
I said, "You're in my..."

34:31.639 --> 34:32.641
(MAN GRUNTS)

34:39.080 --> 34:40.320

(GLASS SHATTERING)

34:51.920 --> 34:53.524

What is your emergency?

34:53.600 --> 34:54.601
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

35:20.920 --> 35:22.046
Son of a bitch!

36:04.840 --> 36:06.569
Oh, my God. OFFICER: No one's
allowed into the area.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.523
No, you don't understand! We
know someone on the plane.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.682
I'm sorry.
No unauthorized personnel.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.160
No, it's all right.
They're with me.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.565
Where's Nick?
He's not here.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.210
We think he may have
survived the crash.

36:15.280 --> 36:18.011
Look, he might be infected.
He may not be himself.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.764
So you need to prepare yourselves.
Griffin.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.684
You said if he got infected, a
Grimm might react differently.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.842
I'd say he reacted
a lot differently.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.410
911 call just came in.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.881
A fight broke out at a bar
about two miles from here.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.167
Apparently, a lot of
people are getting hurt.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.163
RENARD: I say we
start there. Come on.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.005

36:59.800 --> 37:00.801
(NICK GRUNTING)

37:03.520 --> 37:07.206
Please, take whatever you want.
Please, just don't hurt me.

37:09.080 --> 37:10.081
(INAUDIBLE WHISPERING)

37:29.480 --> 37:32.086
Don't go in there! He's crazy!
He's got a gun!

37:32.160 --> 37:33.764
There's people hurt.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.320
You're a cop.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.250
Good! Go kill
that son of bitch!

37:38.360 --> 37:39.725
RENARD: Just stay here.
MONROE: I should go with you.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.040
It may not be Nick.
(SNIFFING)

37:41.120 --> 37:44.090
No, no, trust me.
That's Nick.

37:44.160 --> 37:48.051
He was living with me for, you know, a
while, so I know what he smells like.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.605
There's something
different about it now.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.489
What?
ROSALEE: I can't explain it.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.164
It's... It's just
different.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.251
If it's Nick, I can help.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.402
All right, let's just figure out
what we're dealing with, okay?

37:57.480 --> 37:59.960
ROSALEE: I'm telling you,
he's not the same.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.371
Be careful.

38:08.360 --> 38:09.361
(MAN GROANING)

38:13.400 --> 38:16.165
It's gonna be all right.
Just stay down.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.244
Help's on the way.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.770
Back here.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.921
Can you follow him?

38:28.640 --> 38:30.483
I can try.
Good.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.451
We've got to stop him because
it's only gonna get worse.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.006
Go.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.005
That's deep enough.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.411
Thank God.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.651
I wouldn't.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.285
Put them in.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.161
Ugh.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.282
Put the box in the earth.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.687
It must be buried
with your hands.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.603
Of course it must.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.401
(SIGHS)

39:36.480 --> 39:38.482
Now what?
Stand up.

39:40.680 --> 39:44.082
If you have been accepted,
we will soon see.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.570
Nothing's happening.
Shh.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.047

been accepted.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.524
Now, you have to
gather the dead flowers.

Really?

40:59.320 --> 41:00.526
OFFICER: Are you all right?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.200
Did you call 911?

41:03.280 --> 41:05.044
We searched the bar.
Subject has fled the scene.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.770
We need to cordon off the area.

41:06.840 --> 41:07.921
We need some ambulances.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.001
OFFICER: Yes, sir.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.366
Where is he?

41:10.680 --> 41:11.806
He's gone.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.484
We need to find him
before he kills somebody,

41:13.560 --> 41:16.211
because there's no
coming back from that.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.161
(SNIFFING)

41:26.360 --> 41:27.566
Lost him.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.051
Damn.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.243
Found him. This way.
