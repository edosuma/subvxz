WEBVTT

00:09.800 --> 00:11.800
( Thunder crashes )

00:26.400 --> 00:27.260
( Gasps )

00:27.360 --> 00:28.500
Pops,
are you okay?!

00:28.600 --> 00:29.580
Yes.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.100
Just a peculiar dream
is all.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.200
Oh, yeah. I've been having
weird dreams, too, Pops.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.080
Like this one
where Eileen shows up,

00:35.400 --> 00:37.180
and she's wearing...

00:37.280 --> 00:39.300
It's not important.
Everybody has weird dreams.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.900
I suppose.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Well, we've got something
that'll cheer you up.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.660
Come have a look.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.020
( Gasps )

00:46.120 --> 00:48.380
It's you, old friend!

00:48.480 --> 00:51.580
All these years watching you
through my telescope,

00:51.680 --> 00:54.700
and I had no idea
you were my home.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.800
No wonder
it's your favorite planet.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.340
So beautiful up close.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.180
Isn't she marvelous?

01:00.280 --> 01:03.180
Under normal circumstances,
I'd agree.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.280
Eileen: Yeah, don't forget
what we're here for.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.200
We have to battle AntiâPops,
whose whole thing is, like,

01:07.280 --> 01:09.420
erasing the universe
as we know it!

01:09.520 --> 01:10.380
No big deal!

01:10.480 --> 01:13.920
All the more reason to be ready.
Let's get down there!

01:23.040 --> 01:25.340
This is where Pops
came from?

01:25.440 --> 01:27.220
I can't believe it.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.320
I thought it'd be
a little cleaner.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.700
( Groans )

01:30.800 --> 01:32.800
( Groaning )

01:34.960 --> 01:37.500
( All whimpering )

01:37.600 --> 01:38.660
Jolly good!

01:38.760 --> 01:39.660
By Jove!

01:39.760 --> 01:40.820
Dadâsizzle!

01:40.920 --> 01:42.580
Yeah, this is
definitely Pops' planet.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.060
Oh, my!
They're all so welcoming!

01:46.160 --> 01:48.780
You're here!
You're finally here!

01:48.880 --> 01:51.300
We've been waiting eons
for this moment!

01:51.400 --> 01:53.700
Allow us
to introduce ourselves.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.460
I'm FrivolaâKranus!

01:56.560 --> 01:58.620
I'm
QuadraviâKranus!

01:58.720 --> 02:01.460
And I'm
Weird Mushroom Guy!

02:01.560 --> 02:04.460
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet all of you!

02:04.560 --> 02:06.060
Hate to interrupt
the moment,

02:06.160 --> 02:08.500
but don't we have a battle
to prepare for or something?

02:08.600 --> 02:11.400
Together: Oh, very true!
Come along.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.820
Uh, no offense, bros,

02:16.920 --> 02:18.740
but why's your planet
all busted?

02:18.840 --> 02:21.900
This is evidence
of many battles past.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.580
No fight of such a grand scale
is free of collateral damage.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.400
But the Guardian
can tell you all about that.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.500
Uh...

02:32.600 --> 02:35.980
Guardian: My eyes are up here.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.620
I am the Guardian of Lolliland.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.940
I exist to witness
the titans battle

02:42.040 --> 02:45.020
every 14 billion years.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.220
Excuse me, ma'am!

02:48.320 --> 02:51.540
Might you know
how I can defeat AntiâPops?!

02:51.640 --> 02:54.500
I do not. I have never seen
the battle end in victory ââ

02:54.600 --> 02:57.060
only mutually assured
destruction,

02:57.160 --> 02:59.060
followed by a reset
of the universe.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.420
Only this planet survives
in order to record

03:01.520 --> 03:03.860
the outcome
of each encounter.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.140
Chosen one, if you wish
to know more,

03:06.240 --> 03:07.900
study the ancient tapestries.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.860
Do we even
have time for that?

03:09.960 --> 03:12.580
Isn't AntiâPops
supposed to be here soon?!

03:12.680 --> 03:15.740
There is no sign yet
of the one you call AntiâPops,

03:15.840 --> 03:16.700
which is odd.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.180
He's usually on time.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.220
( Beeping )

03:19.320 --> 03:21.480
He's already at Lolliland?!

03:23.400 --> 03:25.980
You ââ why aren't
we moving?!

03:26.080 --> 03:28.500
Uh, well, you erased
half the engine, so...

03:28.600 --> 03:30.420
we're sort of
stalled out, sir.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.820
Then I'll take one
of the smaller ships.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.420
Computer: <i>Coordinates set.</i>
<i>Destination ââ Lolliland.</i>

03:36.520 --> 03:38.520
Warp speed at 10!

03:41.600 --> 03:43.600
Huh?

03:44.200 --> 03:46.200
( Screaming )

03:47.320 --> 03:50.180
This is why I want to end
this stupid universe!

03:50.280 --> 03:52.180
Over a space deer?

03:52.280 --> 03:53.620
I hit
a space deer once.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.500
They're way stronger
than you'd think.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.660
Quiet!

03:57.760 --> 03:59.420
Oh, my chips.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.540
I need to find another way.

04:02.640 --> 04:05.180
Welcome to
the Hall of Tapestries.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.900
Anything you want to know
about the previous battles

04:08.000 --> 04:10.420
exists in these creations.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.660
They "weave"
a very detailed history.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.700
( Laughter )

04:14.800 --> 04:16.780
He says that one
every time.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.780
Still funny.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.780
It is funny!

04:19.880 --> 04:23.420
Here, you can see how you came
into existence.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.520
Different versions of us
were born

04:25.160 --> 04:28.060
over billions of years,
never quite right.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.180
Until you, MegaâKranus.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.220
That's my name?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.180
Both: ( Chuckling ) MegaâKranus.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.260
Yes, you are
the ultimate creation.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.620
However, when you
were created,

04:39.720 --> 04:41.980
the universe had
to balance itself.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.380
Hence,
MalumâKranus was born.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.740
Oh, MalumâKranus.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.140
"Malum" means
"bad," right?

04:49.240 --> 04:50.660
Here, you'll see tapestries

04:50.760 --> 04:53.860
that depict every clash
over the millennia.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.960
Kind of looks like
they're fighting

04:55.040 --> 04:56.460
with pool noodles
in this one.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.660
Oh, yes.
That was a fun one.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.760
Wait, guys, look!

05:02.080 --> 05:04.100
Does that
kind of look like us?

05:04.200 --> 05:06.500
Yes, everything
that's happening now

05:06.600 --> 05:07.660
has happened before.

05:07.760 --> 05:08.580
Everything?

05:08.680 --> 05:11.140
Everything.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.500
Each battle ends in a draw,
with two fists colliding,

05:14.600 --> 05:17.580
resetting the universe,
and ending in rebirth.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.780
Uh, hate to be a downer,
but this sounds kind of...

05:20.880 --> 05:21.940
Futile?

05:22.040 --> 05:23.700
I mean, this has
been happening

05:23.800 --> 05:25.900
for billions
and billions of years.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.860
How are we gonna
buck the odds?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.960
Skips: This doesn't
look good.

05:34.480 --> 05:37.340
( Gasps )

05:37.440 --> 05:38.460
Dude, you got an idea?

05:38.560 --> 05:40.140
Yes.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.860
Mordecai: Okay, every battle
starts in this coliseum

05:42.960 --> 05:45.780
with Pops on this side
and AntiâPops on that side.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.300
We know where he's gonna be.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.700
We can catch him off guard
with some traps.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.820
If we want to win,
the only choice we have

05:51.920 --> 05:52.980
is to change things up.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.420
That's not
a terrible idea.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.340
This is like pranking
the most evil guy ever.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.060
Consider the
master prankster in!

06:01.160 --> 06:05.340
Oh, a sneak attack?
That doesn't seem very sporting.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.300
It's true, this plan
doesn't seem fair,

06:07.400 --> 06:08.940
but I think
it's our best bet.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.940
You too, Eileen?

06:11.040 --> 06:13.660
I know how it sounds,
but everyone and everything

06:13.760 --> 06:15.780
we know and love
is on the line here.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.940
It's up to you, Pops.
If you want to keep doing this

06:18.040 --> 06:20.040
how it's always been done,
that's your choice.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.920
You're the chosen one.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.260
Okay.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.020
Let's do it.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.020
Traps, traps,
traps, traps!

06:29.120 --> 06:30.340
He already
said we'd do it!

07:03.720 --> 07:05.580
( Beeping )

07:05.680 --> 07:07.380
( Horn honks )

07:07.480 --> 07:10.360
( Techno music plays )
'Sup? You MalumâKranus?

07:10.440 --> 07:13.220
Took you long enough.
What is this?

07:13.320 --> 07:14.380
There's not enough room!

07:14.480 --> 07:15.900
Always room
in the front.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.340
Come sit up here
with me, bro.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.820
I'm not doing that.
Gruff, you sit up front.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.100
Aw, man!
I don't want to!

07:23.200 --> 07:25.240
â( Growls )
âYes, sir!

07:26.760 --> 07:27.820
Floor it!

07:27.920 --> 07:29.940
I hate to tell ya,
traffic's backed

07:30.040 --> 07:31.900
all up and down
the 405 galaxy.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.820
Oh, hey, do you want
waters or snacks?

07:33.920 --> 07:35.660
They're in the side door
back there.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.760
I don't want to hear it!
Just go!

07:38.920 --> 07:41.380
Hey, how's the music?
The, uh, volume okay?

07:41.480 --> 07:42.940
Silence!

07:43.040 --> 07:45.260
Yeah, I don't really like
this music, either.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.780
( Music stops )

07:46.880 --> 07:48.880
Yeah, I've been doing this
about six years,

07:48.640 --> 07:50.380
but this isn't, like,
my main gig.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.460
Deejaying's what gets me
out of bed.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.660
Oh, hey, if you ever need
someone to spin at a party...

07:54.760 --> 07:57.360
( AntiâPops screams )

07:59.440 --> 08:01.560
AntiâPops draws near.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.580
AntiâPops: And in
this corner of the ring,

08:11.680 --> 08:14.700
the ferocious fighter,
the erratic eraser,

08:14.800 --> 08:17.580
you love him,
you love to hate him ââ

08:17.680 --> 08:20.760
MalumâKranus!

08:27.040 --> 08:29.980
Pops, I'm surprised
you're still standing

08:30.080 --> 08:32.060
after our last showdown.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.740
But don't worry.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.740
I'll make sure that
doesn't happen this time.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.980
It's doesn't have
to end this way.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.660
Please, can't we
settle this peacefully?

08:41.760 --> 08:42.700
Peacefully?

08:42.800 --> 08:44.780
( Laughs )

08:44.880 --> 08:46.540
Peace doesn't
interest me!

08:46.640 --> 08:49.020
I won't be satisfied
until the universe

08:49.120 --> 08:50.940
has come to an end
by my hand!

08:51.040 --> 08:53.260
Now, let's get
on with it.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.620
It is time.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.740
The titans have gathered
in the coliseum.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.140
And now, as is tradition,

08:58.240 --> 09:01.440
the ancient Lolliland anthem
will be performed.

09:02.160 --> 09:06.140
This year, sung by local boy
EggumâKranus!

09:06.240 --> 09:07.340
( Feedback )
Ahem!

09:07.440 --> 09:09.980
Oh, Lolliland,
oh, Lolliland

09:10.080 --> 09:12.180
Our ball of beautiful dust

09:12.280 --> 09:14.900
Her people strong,
tall ââ nine miles long

09:15.000 --> 09:17.140
With hearts
that you can trust

09:17.240 --> 09:19.740
Despite the titan battles

09:19.840 --> 09:22.500
She stands
through thick and thin

09:22.600 --> 09:25.060
Oh, Lolliland,
oh, Lolliland

09:25.160 --> 09:27.820
May good or evil win

09:27.920 --> 09:29.620
( Upbeat bigâband music plays )

09:29.720 --> 09:32.220
Oh, Lolliland

09:32.320 --> 09:35.720
Mama, take me
to the promised land

09:37.280 --> 09:38.300
( Music stops )
Enough!

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
This battle starts now!

09:45.120 --> 09:46.700
Oh, no.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.800
Now!

09:56.600 --> 09:58.600
( Beeps )

10:00.280 --> 10:02.280
( Grunts )

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
( Horn blares )

10:10.800 --> 10:12.940
I think...we did it.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.420
Wait.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.100
Universe is still here!

10:18.200 --> 10:19.740
( All cheering )

10:19.840 --> 10:22.500
Put <i>that</i>
in a tapestry, son!

10:22.600 --> 10:24.460
Right away, sir.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.820
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!

10:25.920 --> 10:27.920
( Evil laughter )

10:31.680 --> 10:32.780
That tickled.

10:32.880 --> 10:33.700
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
