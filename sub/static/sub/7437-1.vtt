02:58.400 --> 02:59.500
Please!

03:14.500 --> 03:17.500
Aziz. Aziz.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.800
Aziz, light!

03:23.400 --> 03:24.400
Aziz...

03:24.600 --> 03:25.500
light.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.500
Good.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.400
We start again.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.100
"When the three planets
are in eclipse...

03:34.200 --> 03:36.400
the black hole,
like a door, is open.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.400
Evil comes...

03:38.600 --> 03:40.900
spreading terror and chaos."

03:41.100 --> 03:44.600
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.600
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I've got your snakes.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.300
I got all the snakes.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.700
When is the snake act
supposed to occur?

03:53.500 --> 03:55.200
If this is the five...

03:55.500 --> 03:57.600
and this is the one...

04:02.500 --> 04:04.100
every 5,000 years.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.800
So, I've got some time then.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.800
You bring them water.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.800
Good boy.
I'll take it to them.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.800
Go with God.
Be safe from evil.

04:24.500 --> 04:28.200
You see here these different peoples,
or symbols of people...

04:28.400 --> 04:30.400
gathering the four elements
of life...

04:30.600 --> 04:33.500
water, fire, earth, air...

04:33.700 --> 04:35.500
around a fifth one.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.000
A fifth...

04:38.000 --> 04:39.200
element.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.400
Forgive me, Lord.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
They already know
too much.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.300
Father.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.900
How are you?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.100
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.

04:56.200 --> 05:00.100
I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.700
It's the greatest find
in history.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.200
You must be parched.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.200
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.700
It's like a battle plan.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.500
Here the good.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.900
Here the evil.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.300
And here, a weapon...

05:17.500 --> 05:19.600
against evil.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.400
I'm going
to be famous.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.500
Then let us toast
to your fame.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.000
To fame.

05:29.700 --> 05:30.900
Salute.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.700
You can't toast
with water.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.100
Billy, in my sack,
the grappa.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.600
This I don't understand.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.300
This could be something...

05:54.800 --> 05:56.500
prehistoric.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.100
I don't know.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.100
But, wait.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.800
Here.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.100
Look, look.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.600
They're here.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.800
This man...

06:32.300 --> 06:34.400
this perfect being.

06:34.900 --> 06:37.100
I know this is the key.
I know it.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.500
This divine light
they talk about.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.600
What is divine light?

06:49.100 --> 06:50.300
Aziz, light!

06:52.300 --> 06:54.300
Much better.
Thank you.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.400
My Lord.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.700
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I've ever seen.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.100
Don't you think?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.900
Are you German?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.100
Lord...

08:11.200 --> 08:13.200
I know he was about
to discover everything.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.500
But, no worry.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.500
I was there in time.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.000
Priest...

08:18.100 --> 08:19.800
you and those before you...

08:20.000 --> 08:22.900
have served us well.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.300
But war is coming.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.600
Stones not safe
on Earth anymore.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.400
This...

08:46.800 --> 08:48.600
is really amazing.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.800
The fifth element.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.600
Take the stones.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.500
My Lord...

10:07.500 --> 10:09.900
if you take the weapon,
we'll be defenseless...

10:10.100 --> 10:11.400
when evil returns.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.700
In 300 years...

10:13.900 --> 10:16.100
when evil returns...

10:16.300 --> 10:18.300
so shall we.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.700
Oh, Professor.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
Professor.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.400
Don't move!

10:39.200 --> 10:40.600
I have a gun!

10:40.800 --> 10:44.200
Please, understand.
They're our friends.

10:44.300 --> 10:45.500
Friends?

10:45.600 --> 10:49.200
Father, they've killed the Professor!
They're monsters!

10:49.300 --> 10:50.900
I'll explain everything.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.600
- You're with them?
- Look at me.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.000
I am your friend.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.600
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!

10:57.700 --> 10:59.500
Please, put...

10:59.600 --> 11:01.800
the gun down.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.100
Billy, no!

11:11.600 --> 11:12.600
Hurry!

11:12.800 --> 11:14.000
The wall is closing!

11:14.200 --> 11:16.000
Here is your mission:

11:16.200 --> 11:18.300
Pass your knowledge
to the next priest...

11:18.400 --> 11:20.100
as it was passed to you.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.000
I will do as
you command, but...

11:22.200 --> 11:24.000
hurry, you still
have time.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.900
Time not important.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.600
Only life...

11:27.700 --> 11:28.800
important.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.900
I will fulfill
my mission!

11:45.100 --> 11:46.600
You can count on me!

11:50.500 --> 11:53.300
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.600
Anything yet?

12:23.700 --> 12:26.000
- Not even a temperature?
- The analyzers have jammed.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.700
One shows a million degrees,
the others minus 5,000.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.900
Let's see it.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.200
It's taking shape.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.400
Send out a probe.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.400
Ladies and gentlemen...

13:12.400 --> 13:15.700
the President of
the Federated Territories.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.200
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.400
I saved this seat
for you, Father.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.800
President on the line.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.200
We're in position.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.400
I have to address the Supreme Council.
Just the facts.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.100
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis yet.

13:41.100 --> 13:43.000
All the calibers are overshot.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.900
We're initiating
thermonucleatic imaging.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.800
What you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.500
All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.600
Recommendation?

13:51.700 --> 13:54.800
My philosophy is
shoot first and ask questions later.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.400
I don't like uninvited guests.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.700
All right, then.

13:58.900 --> 13:59.900
Mr. President?

14:02.500 --> 14:06.100
Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.100
I...

14:08.300 --> 14:11.000
have a different theory
to offer you, sir.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.900
You have 20 seconds.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.100
Imagine that this...

14:21.200 --> 14:24.400
thing is not anything
that can be identified...

14:24.600 --> 14:26.800
because it prefers not to be.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.600
Wherever there is life...

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
it brings death...

14:31.800 --> 14:32.800
because it's evil.

14:33.000 --> 14:33.900
Absolute evil.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.600
One more reason
to shoot first.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.500
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.200
Shooting will only
make it stronger.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.700
Probe will obtain objective
in five seconds.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.100
Growth rate is at 27%.

14:54.300 --> 14:57.200
Your theory is interesting,
but we don't have time to go into it.

14:57.300 --> 15:00.800
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.500
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.700
We'll protect the life of 200 billion
of my fellow citizens.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.500
You may fire when ready.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.800
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.700
Its structure solidified
on the surface.

15:19.900 --> 15:23.500
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.000
The most...

15:25.200 --> 15:27.800
terrible intelligence imaginable.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.000
120's loaded.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.800
The ship is
in combat formation.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.900
Missiles are loaded.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.200
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.900
I have a doubt.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.000
I don't, Mr. President.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.900
What happened?
Can you hear me?

15:56.800 --> 15:57.800
What happened?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.600
- Did you destroy it?
- I'm about to.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.200
The planet has increased
diameter by 200%.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.800
It's moving toward the ship.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.400
What do we have
that's bigger than 240?

16:18.600 --> 16:19.900
Nothing, sir.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.900
Staedert, do you hear me?

16:23.200 --> 16:24.500
Get out of there.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.900
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?

16:28.100 --> 16:31.300
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?

16:31.400 --> 16:33.400
Do you understand?
Listen.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.200
That's an order.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.500
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.700
Get out of there!

16:42.800 --> 16:44.700
Good God!

17:08.000 --> 17:09.700
Four a day.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.700
I'm tryin'.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.300
To quit is my goal.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.400
I'm up.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.500
All right, I'm up.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.900
God.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.000
Hey, dog brain,
Finger here.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Hi, sweetie.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.400
I love you too.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.100
You haven't called me that
since basic training.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.300
I was talking
to the cat.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.000
I forgot...

17:53.000 --> 17:55.600
you prefer your cat
to the real thing.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.300
At least the cat
comes back.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.600
Still pining
for that two-timing slut?

17:59.800 --> 18:01.100
There's millions
out there.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.900
I don't want
a million.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.000
I just want one.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.100
The perfect one.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.000
It don't exist, Major.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, I know.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
What?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Picture of you.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.600
- How do I look?
- Like shit.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.200
Must be an old picture.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.600
Bring me your hack
for a six-month overhaul.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.000
- Negative.
- A.S.A.P.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
I don't need one.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.600
Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions?
I know how you drive.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.500
Finger, I drive
a cab now...

18:30.700 --> 18:32.300
not a space fighter.

18:32.500 --> 18:36.200
Tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?

18:36.400 --> 18:38.600
Major, how many points?

18:38.700 --> 18:40.200
At least 50.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.800
Know what?
You gotta learn to lie better.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.200
See you tonight.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.400
Welcome to Paradise.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.300
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.300
It's Ruby Rhod,
and I'll tell you live at five...

18:56.500 --> 18:59.700
the winner of the super green
Gemini Croquette Contest!

18:59.900 --> 19:03.200
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.000
Tune in to Radio Cosmos.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.300
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.800
For a perfect world.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.800
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?

19:16.900 --> 19:19.400
Long enough.
Give me the cash.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.300
Is that a Z-140?

19:21.400 --> 19:22.700
Alleviated titanium.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.300
Neurocharged assault model.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.500
Good thing for me
it's not loaded.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.900
It's not loaded?

19:31.300 --> 19:32.600
You have to...

19:33.100 --> 19:35.700
push that yellow button
to load it.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.100
Take your time.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.400
Want me to--

19:48.700 --> 19:50.100
There you go.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.300
Give me the cash!

19:58.400 --> 20:00.200
That's a very
dangerous gun.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.600
Maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.500
You don't mind, do you?
You sure?

20:06.600 --> 20:09.800
No. Take it.
I don't need it.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.700
That's a nice hat.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.200
You like it?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.100
God!

20:26.200 --> 20:28.000
Please enter your license.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.200
Yes, just a minute.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.100
Welcome, Mr. Dallas.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.500
Good morning.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.200
Sleep well? Me too.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.200
I had a horrible nightmare.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.400
Propulsion 2-X-4.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.400
You have five points left
on your license.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.100
Yeah, thank you
for reminding me.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.300
Have a nice day.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.700
Why not?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.600
You have 48 hours.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.700
That's the time it needs to adapt
itself to our living conditions.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.900
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.

21:11.100 --> 21:14.500
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

21:16.400 --> 21:18.100
but to exterminate life.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.800
All forms of life.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.900
You're telling me
there's nothing that can stop this.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.400
There is only one thing.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.900
The Mondoshawan have in their
possession the weapon to defeat evil.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.100
Four elements...

21:36.700 --> 21:38.700
gathered around a fifth...

21:39.000 --> 21:41.600
supreme being,
the ultimate warrior...

21:41.800 --> 21:43.600
created to protect life.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.900
Together they produce
"The Light of Creation."

21:47.000 --> 21:50.200
Able to bring life to the farthest
reaches of the universe.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.900
But, if...

21:53.100 --> 21:55.200
evil stands there...

21:56.800 --> 21:58.000
Then what?

21:58.300 --> 22:00.400
Then light turns to dark.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.100
Life to death...

22:02.300 --> 22:03.500
forever.

22:05.800 --> 22:10.800
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests
permission to enter our territory.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.700
Give it permission to enter
with our warmest regards.

22:15.900 --> 22:16.800
Thank you.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.000
Permission to enter granted.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.300
Show time.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.400
We are lost.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.400
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.800
Mr. Zorg's office.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.200
It's Aknot.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.800
I'm so glad
to hear you, Aknot.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.400
The mission is accomplished.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.000
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.900
Good.
I'll meet you at my factory.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.500
The attack was by
two unregistered warships.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.300
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.400
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.

23:53.700 --> 23:57.000
Three hundred years
of waiting for nothing.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.300
Go get some rest.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.700
No.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.900
The Mondoshawan...

24:03.600 --> 24:04.700
I am their contact.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.300
They will come for me.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.100
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.600
The rescue team has reported
from the crash site.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.100
Any survivors?

24:16.300 --> 24:17.600
Only one.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.400
You call that a survivor?

24:22.500 --> 24:24.700
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.200
Have you identified it?

24:26.400 --> 24:27.900
The computer went
off the charts.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.900
Normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

24:31.100 --> 24:33.600
which is enough
for any species to perpetuate.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.800
This has 200,000 memo groups.

24:41.300 --> 24:42.800
Sounds like
a freak of nature.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.000
Yeah, can't wait
to meet him.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.400
You okay?
Over here.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.800
Excuse me.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.300
General, I want
to show you something.

25:05.900 --> 25:08.700
This is a normal
human DNA chain.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.000
You, me, anybody, right?

25:11.100 --> 25:12.500
Watch this.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.800
The compositional elements
of his DNA chain are like ours.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.200
There's simply more of them,
with infinite genetic knowledge.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.100
Almost like this being
was engineered.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.500
Is there any danger?

25:28.700 --> 25:30.800
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.000
The cell is,
for lack of a better word...

25:33.600 --> 25:35.000
perfect.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.200
Go ahead.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.100
Mr. Perfect better be polite.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.400
Otherwise, I turn him
into cat food.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.200
Activate it.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.100
Tissue processing.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.900
Ten seconds to
ultraviolet protection.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.400
This is the last phase.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.700
The cells are bombarded by atoms
which forces the body to react.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.400
That means
growing skin.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.000
Wonderful.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.600
Reconstruction complete.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.600
Remove the shield.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.500
I told you.
Perfect.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.300
Thermal bandages.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.200
I'd...

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
like to take
a few pictures...

27:31.900 --> 27:33.300
for the archives.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.500
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.200
Activate the phonic detector.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.100
Is that thing solid?

28:52.200 --> 28:53.700
- Unbreakable.
- Good.

29:03.900 --> 29:05.300
If you want out...

29:05.700 --> 29:09.400
you'll have to develop
those communication skills.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.800
General alert.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.900
Perfect.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.200
Ladder on 18.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.500
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.900
This way.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.200
Lady, stay calm.

31:04.300 --> 31:05.900
This is the police.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.200
There's nowhere
else to go.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.300
Slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.100
Do you understand?

31:17.500 --> 31:18.800
She doesn't.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.400
I think we need
a flying unit.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.800
This is the police.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.200
This is the police.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.500
We are processing
your identification.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.100
Put your arms up
and follow our instructions.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.500
She has no file.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.100
She dove off.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.500
You just had an accident.

32:34.700 --> 32:37.700
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard!

32:39.200 --> 32:41.400
You have one point left
on your license.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.100
Look out!

32:43.200 --> 32:44.500
Left!

32:49.200 --> 32:51.100
I can't believe it.
Shit.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.400
Any survivors?

33:04.500 --> 33:05.500
Hi.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.300
Are you okay?

33:37.700 --> 33:39.100
Boom.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.700
Boom. Yeah,
I understand "boom."

33:41.900 --> 33:43.900
Bada boom.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.800
Big.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.500
Big bada boom.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.600
Big...

33:48.900 --> 33:50.500
bada big boom.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.000
Big boom.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.600
Yeah, big bada boom.

33:53.700 --> 33:54.900
Bada boom.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.500
Big boom.
Big bada boom.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.300
You're lucky you're not dead.

34:05.900 --> 34:08.000
This is a police control.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.000
Please keep your hands
on the wheel.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.199
You have an unauthorized passenger
in your vehicle.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.300
We are going
to arrest her.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.100
Thank you for cooperating.

34:18.300 --> 34:19.699
Sorry, honey.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.800
Looks like
this is your ride.

34:21.900 --> 34:23.000
Open the door.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.100
Do what they say.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.400
Sorry.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.199
"Please...

34:55.500 --> 34:57.500
help."

34:57.600 --> 34:59.300
I only have one point
left on my license.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.200
I need it to get back to the garage
and get the cab a six-month overhaul.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.700
You understand?

35:06.600 --> 35:09.000
Can you please
open the passenger door?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.100
Please...

35:14.600 --> 35:16.500
help.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.700
I can't.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.800
I repeat...

35:25.800 --> 35:27.600
open the passenger door.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.400
Yeah, yeah, sure.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.900
Why not?

35:46.100 --> 35:47.900
Thank you
for your cooperation.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.400
Help.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.900
Finger's going
to kill me.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.500
Emergency!
Emergency!

36:05.600 --> 36:07.300
One point has
been removed.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.500
Yes, I know!

36:14.800 --> 36:16.700
This is so stupid.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.200
Assist in pursuit
of yellow cab.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.400
Unit 47,
we're on the way...

36:22.600 --> 36:23.900
after we finish lunch.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.800
Two golden menus.

36:29.900 --> 36:34.600
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.000
Thank you so much.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.900
And I'm definitely
too thirsty.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.200
Look out!

36:50.500 --> 36:52.000
We got lucky.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.900
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.

37:03.100 --> 37:04.500
Maybe two miles.

37:05.800 --> 37:06.800
Hang on.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.900
Look, lady...

37:17.000 --> 37:19.700
I only speak English
and bad English!

37:22.100 --> 37:23.100
Run an ID.

37:25.900 --> 37:30.100
I'm all for conversation, but maybe
you can just shut up for a minute!

37:31.600 --> 37:33.400
He's got a scan blocker.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.300
Means he's a car thief.
Blast him.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.300
I don't know
what you did...

37:44.600 --> 37:46.100
but they are pissed off!

37:46.200 --> 37:47.200
Hold on!

38:04.700 --> 38:06.500
We're safe for a while.

38:31.300 --> 38:33.900
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.

38:34.100 --> 38:37.500
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.

38:47.900 --> 38:50.200
If we get to the fog,
we'll be okay.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.400
If we make the fog.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.300
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?

39:20.900 --> 39:24.900
We're just going to wait here until
things quiet down if you don't mind.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.900
Shit.

39:49.300 --> 39:50.600
You okay?

39:52.600 --> 39:53.900
Priest.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.600
You don't need a priest,
just a doctor.

39:56.900 --> 40:00.000
Vito Cornelius.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.200
What?

40:01.500 --> 40:03.200
Priest.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.500
Yes?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.400
I'm looking
for a priest.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.300
The weddings are downstairs, my son.
Congratulations.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.600
She's not my bride.
She's my fare.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.700
She's looking for
Vito Cornelius.

40:19.700 --> 40:21.700
The phone book
said he lived here.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.900
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.700
Nobody does.
No file, no ID, nothing.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.900
She's got a tattoo
on this arm.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.800
Tattoo?

40:42.600 --> 40:44.100
Fifth...

40:44.600 --> 40:45.800
element.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.100
Finger's going
to kill me.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.900
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?

40:56.100 --> 40:58.400
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.000
She just dropped in on me.

41:02.100 --> 41:04.600
Started speaking
a bizarre language.

41:04.700 --> 41:07.100
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.

41:07.300 --> 41:09.100
It's the ancient language...

41:09.200 --> 41:12.300
spoken throughout the universe
before time was time.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.300
He's a she.

41:15.300 --> 41:16.800
You noticed that.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.000
Yes.

41:24.300 --> 41:26.600
- It's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.

41:26.700 --> 41:28.500
Not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.400
But gently,
because this woman is...

41:31.500 --> 41:34.000
mankind's most precious possession.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.800
She is perfect.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.800
Perfect.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.200
More dignified.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.900
Hey, lady...

41:52.000 --> 41:53.300
wake up.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.500
I shouldn't
have done that.

42:06.600 --> 42:09.000
It was wrong
to kiss you.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.800
He said
to wake you gently.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.400
You're right.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.800
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.500
Remember?

42:19.900 --> 42:20.900
"Bada boom?"

42:22.000 --> 42:23.600
"Big bada boom?"

42:24.000 --> 42:26.700
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.300
I drive a cab.
This is me.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.100
Korben Dallas.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.400
Korben.
You understand?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Here.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.200
Take it.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.200
You can call me
when you learn English.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.200
Just kidding.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.100
What is your name?

42:49.500 --> 42:50.800
You.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.500
Korben.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.200
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.

42:59.300 --> 43:00.300
Good.

43:01.600 --> 43:03.300
All that's your name?

43:04.200 --> 43:05.200
Do you have...

43:07.300 --> 43:08.500
a shorter name?

43:11.500 --> 43:12.800
Short.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.200
Korben Dallas.

43:19.400 --> 43:20.600
Leeloo.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.000
Leeloo.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.500
Korben, Leeloo.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.500
Leeloo, Korben.

43:46.300 --> 43:48.200
You're sure
she's a Supreme Being?

43:48.400 --> 43:50.100
Absolutely sure.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.700
Old friends.

43:52.900 --> 43:54.200
Yeah, you're right.

43:54.500 --> 43:57.200
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?

43:57.500 --> 43:58.700
Korben Dallas.

43:59.900 --> 44:01.700
Thank you for your help.

44:01.900 --> 44:04.700
You've been kind,
but now the girl needs to rest.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.900
She's been on
a long trip.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.300
I know.
I was there when she landed.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.800
Wait, wait, Father.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.400
She said something
I didn't understand.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.900
What does
"ekto gamat" mean?

44:17.900 --> 44:19.400
"Never without my permission."

44:20.100 --> 44:21.600
That's what I thought.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.600
I shouldn't have
kissed her.

44:37.100 --> 44:40.800
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.700
How about some
nice Thai food?

44:44.900 --> 44:46.900
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

44:47.100 --> 44:49.500
Buddy, I'm waiting
all day here.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.400
- Finger.
- Where's the cab?

44:51.600 --> 44:53.500
Car's running fine.

44:53.600 --> 44:55.400
Fine. What "fine"?

44:55.600 --> 44:58.400
I know you.
"Fine" ain't in your vocabulary.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.900
You can tell your old buddy Finger
what happened.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.300
What? You save the planet?

45:03.300 --> 45:07.100
You dinged the fender again.
That's it, right?

45:07.500 --> 45:10.900
I was on my way to see you,
and a fare fell in my lap.

45:11.100 --> 45:14.300
One of these big fares
you can't resist.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.300
How big?

45:24.800 --> 45:26.600
Five-nine...

45:27.200 --> 45:28.400
blue eyes...

45:28.600 --> 45:30.600
long legs, great skin.

45:30.900 --> 45:32.700
You know?
Perfect.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.500
I see.

45:34.700 --> 45:38.500
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.200
Leeloo.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.000
What's she doing?

45:51.100 --> 45:54.100
Learning our history,
the last 5,000 years that she missed.

45:54.300 --> 45:56.000
She's been asleep
for a while.

46:08.100 --> 46:11.400
I know she's been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

46:11.500 --> 46:12.600
You're right.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.600
Chicken.

46:16.700 --> 46:18.000
Good.

46:21.400 --> 46:22.900
Chicken.

46:27.700 --> 46:31.000
I'm really sorry
to interrupt you, but...

46:31.200 --> 46:32.600
the case...

46:33.100 --> 46:34.700
with the stones...

46:35.900 --> 46:36.900
where is it?

46:39.200 --> 46:40.500
Stolen?

46:43.100 --> 46:45.700
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?

46:50.700 --> 46:51.700
Excuse me, sir.

46:51.800 --> 46:54.000
The council is worried
about the economy heating up.

46:54.100 --> 46:56.800
Is it possible
to fire 500,000?

46:56.900 --> 47:01.400
I thought from a smaller company,
like one of the cab companies.

47:01.500 --> 47:03.400
Fire one million.

47:03.500 --> 47:05.600
But 500,000--

47:10.400 --> 47:11.700
One million.

47:11.900 --> 47:12.900
Fine, sir.

47:13.300 --> 47:15.000
Sorry to have
disturbed you.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.100
It's for the Supreme...

47:29.900 --> 47:31.600
Sorry.

47:32.400 --> 47:36.000
I didn't know your size,
and I found you this makeup box.

47:36.900 --> 47:38.900
You just put it like that.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.400
Yes, there was
a man with a limp...

47:43.100 --> 47:46.200
came here a month ago
asking about the stones.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.900
Said he was an art dealer.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.600
What was his name?

47:54.600 --> 47:56.300
I'm bad with names.

48:02.600 --> 48:06.100
- They really make her--
- Perfect, I know.

48:10.300 --> 48:11.900
What'd she say?

48:13.500 --> 48:16.000
She says she knows
exactly where they are.

48:19.600 --> 48:23.400
My dear Aknot, how about
those two planes you borrowed?

48:24.300 --> 48:25.600
Aknot, is that you?

48:25.700 --> 48:27.400
What an ugly face.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.000
It doesn't suit you.

48:30.200 --> 48:31.300
Take it off.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.800
That's better.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.600
Never be ashamed
of who you are.

48:36.900 --> 48:38.300
You're warriors.
Be proud.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
So what if the federal government
scattered you to the wind.

48:42.200 --> 48:45.200
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

48:45.400 --> 48:48.200
Your time for revenge
is at hand.

48:49.300 --> 48:50.900
The ZF-1.

48:53.600 --> 48:57.100
It's light. The handle's adjustable
for easy carrying.

48:57.300 --> 49:00.700
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.

49:00.900 --> 49:02.900
A word on fire power:

49:03.100 --> 49:06.700
Titanium recharger, 3,000-round clip,
with bursts of 3 to 300.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.700
With the replay button,
a Zorg invention, it's even easier.

49:10.800 --> 49:11.900
One shot...

49:13.000 --> 49:15.800
and replay sends every following shot
to the same location.

49:22.800 --> 49:26.300
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Rocket launcher.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.300
Arrow launcher...

49:31.700 --> 49:33.300
with exploding
or poisonous heads.

49:34.700 --> 49:36.000
Very practical.

49:36.100 --> 49:37.400
Net launcher.

49:38.900 --> 49:40.300
The flamethrower.

49:44.800 --> 49:45.800
My favorite.

49:46.300 --> 49:48.300
And for the grand finale...

49:48.500 --> 49:50.900
the new Ice Cube System.

49:59.500 --> 50:01.200
Four full crates...

50:01.400 --> 50:02.900
delivered right on time.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
And what about you,
dear Aknot?

50:06.200 --> 50:07.700
Did you bring
what I asked?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.700
Yes.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.700
Magnificent.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.100
This--

50:24.700 --> 50:27.000
This case is empty.

50:28.500 --> 50:29.700
Empty?

50:29.800 --> 50:30.700
Empty...

50:30.900 --> 50:32.600
the opposite of full.

50:33.100 --> 50:36.100
This case
is supposed to be full!

50:38.700 --> 50:40.200
Anyone care to explain?

50:42.400 --> 50:46.500
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.

50:49.700 --> 50:51.800
Who took another route.

50:53.200 --> 50:56.000
She's supposed
to contact this person...

50:56.200 --> 50:57.800
in a hotel.

51:01.900 --> 51:03.700
And she's looking
for the address.

51:03.900 --> 51:04.900
Easy.

51:06.900 --> 51:08.100
Dot.

51:12.500 --> 51:15.400
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.600
We're saved.

51:18.700 --> 51:19.900
I'm screwed.

51:20.100 --> 51:22.400
You asked for a case.
We brought one.

51:22.600 --> 51:25.000
A case with four stones
in it!

51:25.100 --> 51:27.400
Not one or two or three,
but four!

51:27.600 --> 51:28.800
Four stones!

51:29.000 --> 51:31.800
But what the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.100
We are warriors,
not merchants.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.500
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.100
Four stones, four crates.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.100
Zero stones, zero crates!

51:43.000 --> 51:45.200
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!

51:47.800 --> 51:49.900
We risked our lives.

51:50.200 --> 51:54.000
I believe a little compensation
is in order.

51:55.400 --> 51:58.300
So you are merchants
after all.

51:59.700 --> 52:02.300
Leave him one crate
for the cause.

52:05.300 --> 52:06.700
I don't like warriors.

52:06.800 --> 52:08.100
Narrow-minded,
no subtlety...

52:08.200 --> 52:11.500
and they fight
for hopeless causes, honor.

52:11.600 --> 52:14.500
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.

52:14.700 --> 52:17.100
I'll tell you what I do like:
a killer.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.800
A dyed-in-the-wool killer,
cold-blooded, clean and methodical.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.900
A real killer
picking up the ZF-1...

52:23.100 --> 52:26.600
would've asked about the red button
on the bottom of the gun.

52:45.100 --> 52:46.500
Bring me the priest.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.500
I got everything we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise...

52:51.700 --> 52:53.200
and a blueprint
of the hotel.

52:53.500 --> 52:56.600
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.

52:56.900 --> 52:59.400
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.900
Flights are full,
and the hotel will be guarded.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.500
There must be a way.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
I'll get it.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
Weddings?

53:17.700 --> 53:18.700
Not really.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.700
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Who?

53:21.800 --> 53:23.500
Mr. Zorg.

53:24.100 --> 53:25.100
Jean-Baptiste...

53:25.500 --> 53:26.400
Emmanuel...

53:26.600 --> 53:27.600
Zorg.

53:31.200 --> 53:33.400
It's nice to see
you again, Father.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.900
I remember you now.

53:36.400 --> 53:39.000
The so-called art dealer.

53:39.300 --> 53:41.300
I'm glad you got
your memory back.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.300
Because you'll need it.

53:45.400 --> 53:46.900
Where are the stones?

53:47.700 --> 53:48.500
I don't know.

53:48.700 --> 53:51.000
If I did, I wouldn't tell
someone like you.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.500
Why?

53:53.200 --> 53:54.600
What's wrong with me?

53:54.800 --> 53:56.400
I try to serve life.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.400
But you only...

53:59.800 --> 54:01.200
want to destroy it.

54:01.900 --> 54:03.500
Father...

54:04.400 --> 54:06.300
you're so wrong.

54:06.500 --> 54:07.600
Let me explain.

54:12.400 --> 54:16.600
Life, which you so nobly serve,
comes from destruction and chaos.

54:16.800 --> 54:18.200
Take this empty glass.

54:18.400 --> 54:20.200
Here it is, peaceful...

54:20.400 --> 54:21.300
boring.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.300
But if it is...

54:24.100 --> 54:25.600
destroyed.

54:29.600 --> 54:32.700
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.

54:32.900 --> 54:34.600
Notice how each is useful.

54:37.600 --> 54:39.600
What a lovely ballet ensues...

54:39.800 --> 54:41.400
so full of form and color.

54:41.600 --> 54:45.000
Now think of all those people
that created them.

54:45.900 --> 54:49.600
Technicians, engineers. People who
can feed their children tonight...

54:49.800 --> 54:53.700
so those children can grow up
and have children...

54:53.800 --> 54:55.200
and so on.

54:55.300 --> 54:58.300
Thus adding
to the great chain...

54:58.800 --> 55:00.300
of life.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.500
Water. Fruit.

55:04.600 --> 55:08.300
You see, Father,
by creating a little destruction...

55:08.800 --> 55:10.700
I'm encouraging life.

55:11.200 --> 55:14.100
In reality,
you and I are in the same business.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Cheers.

55:33.300 --> 55:35.400
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?

55:37.000 --> 55:38.100
Or the engineer?

55:43.500 --> 55:46.200
Or their children, maybe?

55:55.200 --> 55:59.300
There, you see how all your
so-called power counts for nothing?

56:00.000 --> 56:03.100
How your entire empire
of destruction comes...

56:03.200 --> 56:04.600
crashing down...

56:04.700 --> 56:07.100
all because of one, little...

56:07.600 --> 56:08.900
cherry.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.900
You saved my life...

56:24.000 --> 56:26.300
and in return,
I'll spare yours...

56:26.900 --> 56:28.000
for now.

56:28.700 --> 56:30.000
You're a monster, Zorg.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.100
I know.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.000
Torture who you have to,
the President, I don't care.

56:40.100 --> 56:42.200
Just bring me the stones.

56:42.800 --> 56:44.000
You have one hour.

56:59.200 --> 57:02.300
It's gobbling up
all the satellites in the galaxy.

57:02.500 --> 57:05.100
Why is it eating up
all the satellites?

57:05.300 --> 57:07.100
We're working on it.

57:18.800 --> 57:22.900
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident
but accept our apologies.

57:23.100 --> 57:25.400
And the stones?
Did you find them?

57:25.600 --> 57:26.600
They weren't on board.

57:26.700 --> 57:27.900
What?

57:28.100 --> 57:30.900
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.

57:31.100 --> 57:32.900
They gave them
to someone they do trust.

57:33.800 --> 57:36.800
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.300
She's singing at a charity ball
in Fhloston Paradise.

57:40.500 --> 57:42.300
She has the stones.

57:43.300 --> 57:44.800
The Mondoshawans will help.

57:44.900 --> 57:46.600
We must send someone...

57:46.800 --> 57:48.100
to get the stones.

57:48.300 --> 57:49.300
Excellent.

57:52.200 --> 57:54.500
I want this operation to be
as discreet as possible.

57:54.900 --> 57:56.900
No troops.
No big operation.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.700
I want your best man
to go undercover.

57:59.900 --> 58:01.700
I have the perfect one.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.300
You've got a message.

58:08.100 --> 58:09.800
Not opening it?
Could be important.

58:11.300 --> 58:13.300
Like the last two
were important.

58:13.800 --> 58:17.100
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.

58:17.400 --> 58:21.200
The second was from my lawyer
telling me he was leaving with my wife.

58:21.900 --> 58:23.300
That is bad luck.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.700
Grandfather say...

58:24.900 --> 58:28.300
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.

58:29.500 --> 58:30.500
I bet you lunch.

58:31.700 --> 58:33.000
Okay.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.200
Come on.

58:39.700 --> 58:40.900
"You are fired."

58:42.300 --> 58:44.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

58:50.300 --> 58:51.600
At least I won lunch.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.100
Good philosophy.

58:53.300 --> 58:56.000
See good in bad.
I like.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.900
- Hello.
- Korben, sweetheart.

58:58.500 --> 59:00.500
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?

59:00.600 --> 59:01.600
Hi, Mom.

59:01.700 --> 59:02.800
Seventeen messages.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.400
Don't say your machine is broken again.
They last 1,000 years.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.100
Mr. Kim,
you should go.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.100
This'll take a minute.

59:10.200 --> 59:13.100
You don't feed your cat a croquette,
who you love more than me.

59:13.200 --> 59:15.600
She didn't breast-feed you.
I did.

59:17.200 --> 59:18.700
Good fortune for you.

59:18.900 --> 59:21.800
You don't have a girl.
I'll never be a grandmother.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.700
It bring you good luck!

59:31.400 --> 59:34.300
My body's failing.
Take me on this trip.

59:34.400 --> 59:35.800
What are you
talking about?

59:35.900 --> 59:37.700
You want to make me beg?

59:37.900 --> 59:40.400
No, all I want
is an explanation.

59:40.500 --> 59:41.700
I just got in.

59:41.800 --> 59:44.700
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.

59:44.800 --> 59:46.300
Besides that,
everything's peachy.

59:46.800 --> 59:48.100
Thanks for asking.

59:48.700 --> 59:51.200
Now settle down
and explain this to me.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.400
You don't know
you won a trip...

59:53.600 --> 59:56.600
to Fhloston Paradise for two
for ten days?

59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.400
I suppose you'll just leave me
on the lunar surface?

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.400
If I'd won a trip,
I'd know.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.600
I would've been notified.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.100
They've been blaring your name out
on the radio for an hour.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.800
I'll call you back.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.700
General, how nice to see you
in the 5000 block.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.100
Nice apartment.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.400
You've settled
into a wonderful life.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.100
Heard you lost your job.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.900
You heard that?

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.600
Don't worry.
I'll get another job.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.800
Don't bother.
We have one for you.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.400
"Major Dallas...

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.100
you've been selected
for a mission."

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.400
- What mission?
- To save the world.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.100
"You leave
for Fhloston Paradise.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.100
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.300
Any questions?

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.700
Why me? I retired
six months ago. Remember?

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.100
Three reasons.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.500
One:

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.400
As a member
of the Elite Special Forces Unit...

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.800
you are an expert in the use of
all necessary weapons and spacecraft.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:09.500
Two: You're the most highly
decorated member of your unit.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.700
The third?

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.800
Of all the members of your unit,
you're the only one left alive.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.000
Check your messages?

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.700
I've had enough good news.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.400
Might be important.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.200
You're a winner!

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.600
You've won the Gemini Contest
and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.200
Here are your tickets.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.400
You rigged the contest?

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.200
Congratulations.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.500
You couldn't
be more discreet?

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.900
Old tricks are the best tricks.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.800
Major Iceborg will
accompany you as your wife.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.100
I am not going.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.600
Why not?

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.300
Excuse me, General.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:07.600
Who is it?

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.700
Who is it?

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.500
My wife.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.700
You remarried?

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.300
Yes... no. I just met this girl,
but I'm going to marry her.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.300
I love her,
but she hates the military.

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
She knows the military
ruined my last marriage.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.800
She can't have anything
to do with it.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.300
If she sees you,
she'll kill me.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.200
- Major--
- You gotta hide somewhere.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.800
You've gotta help me.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.100
We'd love to,
but where can we hide?

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.800
We don't
have time for this.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.400
It's just for one minute.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.700
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.900
No idea--
You have no idea.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.400
- I'm going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.800
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.600
Major!

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.300
You're on my foot.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.800
Major! Major!

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.800
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace--

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800
Dallas.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.900
We heard about your good luck
and need your tickets for Fhloston.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.000
Is this the way
priests vacation?

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.800
We're on a mission.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.200
What kind?

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.100
We have to save
the world, my son.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.200
You're gonna
save the world?

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.100
Yes!

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.700
Down there.
Down there.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.200
This is a police control.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.000
This is not an exercise.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.700
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.800
Just stay here
for one minute.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.900
- This is a police control.
- Don't touch anything.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.700
This is not an exercise.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.400
Can you please spread your legs...

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.400
and place your hands
in the yellow circles.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.900
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.300
Yeah, but I--

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.300
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.600
Let's see it.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.000
Are you classified
as human?

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.900
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.800
I found him.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.900
Mr. Korben Dallas?

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.300
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.200
Smoke you!

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.800
Wrong answer.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.300
The police control
is now terminated.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.700
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.700
We got the guy.
Wasn't easy but we bagged him.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.200
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.600
The guy's been arrested
for uranium smuggling.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:58.000
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place...

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.700
and I'll be in Fhloston
in four hours.

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.400
Don't come back
without the stones.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.400
We got Korben Dallas.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.700
Perfect.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.900
Akanit, take command.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.000
Go to Fhloston
and get the stones.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.000
If Zorg really wants them...

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.400
he'll have to negotiate.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.100
Revenge is at hand.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.700
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.800
I forgot
about the autowash.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.200
There's an autowash
in that shower.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.800
I'm so sorry.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.300
Autowash.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.300
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:02.500
It's funny.
I've met you twice today.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.600
Both times
you've ended up in my arms.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.100
It's my lucky day.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.900
Lucky day.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.800
Did you hear something?

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.200
Cornelius.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.500
Autowash.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.300
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't need your help.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.800
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.800
Autowash.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.800
Coffee's not my specialty.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.300
But you must drink a lot
of coffee being a priest.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.000
I know. I'm not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.900
I'll take the mission.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.700
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.000
Good.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.600
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.500
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.500
I can't be your husband.
I'm too old.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.400
Now David is...

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.200
in great shape.
he'll protect you.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:56.500
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect
the stones and meet me at the temple.

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.100
Now. Yes.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.700
Okay.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.700
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.600
The tickets.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.300
- ID, please.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.700
- There.
- In here?

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.200
Mr. Dallas?

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.399
Congratulations on the contest.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.399
Oh, right. Okay.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.100
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.399
The garbage.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.700
Made it!

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.399
I was afraid
I wouldn't make it...

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.800
so I sent David
to pick up my boarding pass.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Now David must go.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.000
Thank you. Bye.

01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:49.899
I am Korben Dallas.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.600
Please report infractions
immediately to the spaceport.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.100
And this is?

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.500
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi-pass.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.500
Multi-pass.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.399
She knows
it's a multi-pass.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:05.500
My wife.
We're newlyweds. Just met.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.300
Bump into each other, sparks happen--
She knows.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.000
Anyway, we're in love.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.300
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.800
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.300
- You want more?
- Yeah.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800
Make that two.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.800
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:35.300
What!

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:37.000
I didn't know
what to do.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:39.800
But this is not possible.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:41.899
This is not possible.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.399
You want some more?

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.899
This is all my fault.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.399
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.600
I know.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.399
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.400
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.700
I don't want
to go to Egypt.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.600
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:09.900
That's me.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.100
Just a minute, please.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.100
It will just take
one more minute.

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.100
We'll be right back.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.300
Mr. Dallas...

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.200
we really need you now.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.600
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and needs to interview you.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.000
Multi-pass.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.600
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.800
Backup unit, zone 18.

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:22.000
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honor to be on his talk show.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.100
He's so green.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.500
I'm sure you're excited.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.700
I'm on vacation
and don't want to be bothered.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.800
I prefer to remain anonymous.

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.100
Korben Dallas!

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:39.500
Here he is! The winner of
the Gemini Croquette Contest.

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:43.500
This boy is fuelled like fire,
so start melting, ladies...

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.200
'cause he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:52.100
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.600
Right on.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.800
And he's got
something to say...

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.400
to those 50 billion pairs of ears
out there.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.200
Pop it, D-man.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.200
Hi.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.700
Unbelievable.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.800
Quiver, ladies.
He's going to set the world on fire.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.300
Right here
from five to seven.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:18.100
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.700
His dreams...

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.200
his desires...

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.100
his most intimates of intimates.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.100
And from what I'm looking at,
intimate is his middle name.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.100
So tell me, my man...

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:30.700
you nervous in the service?

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.200
Not really.

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:39.500
Freeze those knees 'cause Korben's
in the place and he's on the case.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:43.600
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's Prince...

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.000
of Fhloston Paradise!

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.400
The hotel of a thousand and one
follies and lollies.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.000
A magic fountain flowing
with nonstop wine, women and...

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.900
hootchie-kootchie-koo...

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.700
all night long.

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.000
All night long
All night

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:09.600
Start licking stamps, girls, because
he'll have you writing home to Mama.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.800
Here from five to seven,
I'll be your voice, your tongue.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.200
On the trail of the sexiest
man of the year: D-man, your man...

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:20.700
my man.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.700
End of transmission.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.600
See you tomorrow at five.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:28.900
How was it?

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.800
It was just absolutely green.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.400
Green like what?

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.700
Crystal green.

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.800
Any kind of green
you want...

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.900
tree green, emerald,
pond green.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.900
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.600
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.200
It must pop, pop, pop!

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:06.800
So tomorrow, from five to seven...

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.200
please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.300
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.600
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.000
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.100
Tomorrow, from five to seven,
you'll give yourself a hand.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.500
Green?

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.000
Super green.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.600
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.000
That's me.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.400
I only have one Korben Dallas
on my list, and he's checked in.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.600
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.500
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.400
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.500
I need to talk
to someone!

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.400
I don't believe this!

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.700
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.000
I'm sorry. I'm calm.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.300
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.000
To make your flight short...

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.300
flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator...

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.400
which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:15.900
Thank you.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.300
Hi.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.100
- You speak English.
- Yes. I learn.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.400
Good.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.100
We are not on vacation.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.700
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.900
If I hadn't come to get you,
you'd be in trouble.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.100
Understand?

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.400
Yes.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.600
But you, no trouble.

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.800
Me, Fifth Element.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.500
Supreme Being.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.400
Me protect you.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:51.900
Sleep.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.900
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Dallas.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.500
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.700
Thank you.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.000
Are you operative?

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:07.900
Zone two?

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.300
Everything's ready, Captain.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400
What?

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.700
Assume your
individual position.

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.700
But I want all positions!

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.300
Mr. Rhod--

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.600
Parasites in landing gear.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.700
Ground, copy?

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.400
Got it.
Front gear.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.300
Hey, man,
give me some heat, man!

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:31.100
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.500
Some heat over here, man!

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.800
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.000
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.200
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.700
Take that.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.200
Mr. Rhod!

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.200
You can call me Ruby.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.400
Fueled and ready to go.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.900
I'll buy you one.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:20.800
Taken off already?

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.200
I'm not on the plane.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:24.700
What?

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:26.600
The real Dallas
took my place.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.200
I don't understand.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.900
Are you making fun of me?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.200
No, no, no!
I swear! I swear!

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.400
I never felt this way before
with a human.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.600
Really?

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.600
I've tried everything.
There's no way to get on the plane.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:51.800
Ground is clear.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.500
Ready for liftoff?

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:54.900
Confirmed.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:03.600
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.500
- Power pressure?
- Primed.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.600
- Protection?
- Confirmed.

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.800
Power increase.

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.100
Ten seconds.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.700
I am...

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.600
a little...

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.700
disappointed.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:21.600
5...

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:24.300
If there is one thing
I do not like...

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:25.100
3...

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.900
it is to be...

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:27.700
2...

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:29.900
disappointed.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:30.700
1...

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.900
Sorry, it will
never happen again.

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.300
I know.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.400
Liftoff.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.500
We're finally
getting something.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.000
It's sending
radio wavelengths.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.900
What does it want
with radio waves?

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.100
Maybe it wants
to make a call.

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.000
Zorg's office.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.400
I told you I did not
want to be disturbed.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.600
You don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow...

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.600
and Mr. Shadow's
on the line.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500
It's Shadow again.

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.400
Zorg here.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.900
Am I disturbing you?

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.300
No, no, I was just--

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.900
Where are you?

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.800
Not far now.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.400
Good.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.500
Good, good.

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:14.100
How are the stones?

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.900
Fine. Fine.
Just fine.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.000
I'll have the four stones
you asked for any time now...

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.900
but it wasn't easy.

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.500
My costs have tripled.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.500
Money is of no...

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.200
importance.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I...

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:36.500
want...

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.800
the stones.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.300
The stones...

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.400
will be here.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.100
I'll see to it
personally.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:52.700
I will be among you...

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.700
soon.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:58.600
We lost it.

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.300
We lost the signal.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.500
Damn!

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.700
We've begun our descent
toward Fhloston Paradise.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.800
The local time
is 3:20 p.m.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.800
Auto-temperature is currently
85 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:32.800
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and hope to see you again soon.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to paradise.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.400
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.900
Parasites in the main ventilation.

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:46.800
Again?
I'll get it.

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.500
Have we arrived yet?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.500
Oh, good.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
We have twelve swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:07.200
All the restaurants
are between levels two and ten.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.500
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches,
all accessible until 5 p.m...

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.400
then the airship goes higher...

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.100
to offer you a better view.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.600
Is the Diva here?

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.000
Not yet.

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.700
Any tickets left
for the opera?

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:22.600
You have a seat reserved,
front row...

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.900
next to Ruby Rhod!

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.100
He's so talented.
I love him. He's so sexy.

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.700
He has your ticket,
and he'll be here in 20 minutes.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.200
Where can I get
something to wear?

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.500
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.700
You miserable bastard,
I never should've pushed you out.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.700
I was in labor for days,
and this is how you repay me?

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.500
I should've gotten
a robot.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.300
Come on, Ma.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.700
I should be there, not you.
I need a tan.

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.500
I need a cocktail.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:27.500
Get the case in.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.300
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I'm Fog.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.800
Welcome to the--
I'm security.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.800
Welcome to the--

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:40.300
Tall.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.800
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.900
- What's your name?
- Fog.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.400
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad
that you are here.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.600
She'll give you what you've come
to get after the concert.

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:12.700
Stay here.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:19.200
You're listening to Radio Cosmos.
It is 5 p.m.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.400
Helm to 108.

01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:25.400
Helm 108!

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.700
Helm to 108.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.400
Time to join Ruby Rhod...

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:33.400
and Korben Dallas,
the lucky winner...

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.000
of the Gemini Croquette contest.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.400
Coming at you live
from Fhloston...

01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.900
Paradise!

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:46.000
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben
and the manager of this hotel...

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:49.000
and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person...

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.200
and 8,000 other lucksters here...

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.200
to enjoy the privilege of
the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.900
Now we enter what must be...

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:04.700
the most beautiful concert hall
of all the universe!

01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:09.000
A perfect replica
of an old opera house...

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.100
but who cares?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.900
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:18.600
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.600
He's not going to get much
out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:23.900
To who?

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.900
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.700
The Emperor of Kodar Japhet
and his lovely daughter.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.000
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.500
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:42.500
I'll play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time...

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.400
for Korben to say
the word of the day.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:50.000
Tell me, my man, you happy
here in the big world?

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.900
Thrilled.

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.700
And now...

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800
champagne!

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.200
Commercial!
Commercial!

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.000
Break for 30 seconds.

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:26.000
Show time.

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:21.900
I have a ship in trouble
requesting permission to dock.

01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:24.900
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.300
- Permission granted for one hour.
- More than I need.

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.500
Champagne for the Diva.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.300
I'll take it.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.500
I found it.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.400
Get her!

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.000
It was an ambush.

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.500
If it's war they want...

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.800
it's war they'll get!

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.700
Bravo! Bravo!

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.000
Bravo! Bravo!

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.800
My compliments, little lady.

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.400
Thank you for doing
the dirty work.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.400
I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.300
Hand over the stones.

01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:40.900
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.400
Hands up!

01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:56.800
I know this music.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.300
Let's change the beat.

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:09.900
I think we're
being attacked.

01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:11.400
They're everywhere.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.700
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.

01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:18.100
They got big teeth, and they got
big foreheads, and they stink.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.200
Mangalores.

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.400
The government
sent me to help you.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.200
If somebody hears this,
come and get me.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.800
I'm in the first row.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.400
You must give her the stones.

01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:33.500
Who?

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.300
The Fifth Element.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.900
The Supreme Being sent to Earth
to save the universe.

01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.000
Leeloo?

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:46.800
But she's more fragile
than she seems.

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.400
She needs your help...

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.400
and your love...

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:53.300
or...

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.800
she will die.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.100
Stay with me.

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.500
Help!

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.800
If you want
something done...

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.900
do it yourself.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.600
Come on, honey.
You can't die.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.000
Wake up!
Where are the stones?

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.500
Where are the stones?

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.800
The stones.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.400
They're not here.

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.800
The stones,
where are they?

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.500
In me.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.800
What?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.400
Oh, my God, Korben.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.200
Korben, another one coming.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:00.100
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:01.100
Hey, you!

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200
I said you.

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.100
- I'm not with him.
- Where's the other?

01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.600
I said, "one minute."

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.400
Ruby, hold this gun.

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:14.000
What do you
want me to do?

01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:15.100
Come on.

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.700
Put your hand
on it.

01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.200
- What do I do?
- If he moves, squeeze the trigger.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.800
I don't feel right.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.300
- I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."

01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.200
I got a headache.
This ain't me.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.900
Sorry.

01:37:58.300 --> 01:37:59.300
Think he'll be okay?

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.400
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.800
Shit. Three coming.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.800
You guard this
with your life...

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.900
or you'll look like him.
You green?

01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:22.100
Green.

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:23.500
Super green?

01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:26.100
Is that your idea
of a discreet operation?

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:30.100
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.000
Move! Move!

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.200
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.400
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.100
this is amazing.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.700
Let me do it.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.100
Oh, my God.

01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:19.300
Korben Dallas, my man,
is in trouble.

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.200
The gun!

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.900
Give me the gun.

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:32.300
I'm going to go...

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:36.700
and try to see if I can see
something a little closer.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.000
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:05.300
Thanks, Ray.

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.000
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.100
Get up!

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.700
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.200
I'm not armed.

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:19.900
Oh, my God.

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:21.700
I'm on vacation.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.200
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.300
I won a...

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.200
contest.

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.400
Gemini Croquette's to...

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:32.000
Fhloston Paradise.

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.200
Down.

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:38.900
Wait a minute.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.300
Get down!

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.500
He's trying
to say something.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.600
Down!

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.300
Sorry, my man.

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:10.900
Where are you?

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.600
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.300
They're coming.
They're coming.

01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:22.400
Don't move.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:34.700
What you doing?

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:36.500
Count to ten.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.200
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.700
3! 4! 5!

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.000
6...

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.100
7, 8...

01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:54.700
9...

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.100
10.

01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:27.500
I am...

01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:30.000
very disappointed.

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.900
Korben, what are you
looking for?

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.200
Control room.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.700
- This is it.
- I'll be here.

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.200
Let's go.

01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.200
Quiet! Quiet!

01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:47.000
You in charge?

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.700
How many
are out there?

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.500
- I don't know.
- Let's count.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.500
Four on the right.
Two on the left.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:10.500
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.500
One more shot and we start
killing hostages.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.700
That's the leader.

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.700
Send someone to negotiate.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.200
I've never negotiated.

01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:24.400
You mind if I try?

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.000
We're sending
somebody to negotiate.

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:40.000
Anybody else
want to negotiate?

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.900
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.700
I wonder.

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:50.600
Where's Ruby?

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.000
I thought he was dead.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:54.200
Master!

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:57.400
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.400
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.100
still alive.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.100
What's wrong with you?

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.400
It hurt!

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:15.200
I realize that you must be
pretty mad at me...

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.800
but I'm fighting
for a noble cause.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.800
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:23.300
Right now,
I'm trying to save Leeloo.

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:24.600
Leeloo's in trouble?

01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:26.800
When is Leeloo
not in trouble?

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:28.800
- Where's that?
- The Diva's suite.

01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:35.300
Hang on.

01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:39.900
Here, come on.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
How do you get yourself
into these positions?

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.400
Come on.

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:50.700
I'm here. It's all right.
Everything's okay now.

01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:52.200
Listen.

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:57.800
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.300
My man, my man, what's this thing
with all these numbers?

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:16.000
If it was a bomb...

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.500
the alarms would go off because
all these hotels have bomb detectors.

01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.100
This is a type "A" alert.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.300
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.

01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.200
Proceed calmly
to the lifeboats...

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:32.900
Stay calm!

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.500
...located in the main hallways.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.900
Stay calm!

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:44.200
You know how to stop this,
right?

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:53.200
Two minutes
to complete evacuation.

01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.200
Get back!

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.100
Evacuation!
Evacuation!

01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:01.600
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.700
I know.

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:24.100
I don't want to die.

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.400
Please, my son.

01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:27.400
Get in.

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.000
One minute to total evacuation.

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:40.700
This one.

01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.000
45 seconds.

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:50.800
Get her strapped in.

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.600
You know how to fly this?

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.000
Like driving a cab.

01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:06.600
How will we
get out the door?

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.900
15 seconds.

01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:27.900
10...

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.500
9, 8...

01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:31.900
7...

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.600
6...

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:34.900
5.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.500
For the honor.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:00.500
Hold on.

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:24.200
Like driving a cab.

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:28.800
It is now 7 p.m.,
time for the news.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.900
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:33.000
End of transmission.

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.900
That's the best show
I ever did.

01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:41.600
Major Dallas has
the five elements on board...

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.500
and the priest is guiding them
to the temple.

01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:50.400
We're saved.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:09.300
The Diva said
I should take care of you.

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:13.000
Humans act so strange.

01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:14.300
What do you mean?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.100
Everything you created...

01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:19.800
is used to destroy.

01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:23.600
We call it human nature.

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:25.700
You learn that
on your screen?

01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:28.700
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to "V."

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.900
"V" is good.

01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:33.200
Some good words in "V."

01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:34.600
Like what?

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.300
"Valiant."

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.200
"Vulnerable."

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.300
"Very beautiful."

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.500
Oh, of course, Munro!

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:00.900
Mr. President?

01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.300
Now what?

01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:07.100
We have a problem.

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.000
It's advancing?

01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:17.700
It's not only advancing,
it's moving at incredible speed.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:25.500
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.300
Korben, there's
a general on the phone.

01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.700
I'll give you
the President.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.900
Major Dallas, I first
would like to salute a warrior.

01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:44.500
You're a shining example
of this army.

01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:46.400
In the name
of the Federation--

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.500
Any idea when you'll
get to the point?

01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:55.700
A ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
heading straight for earth...

01:50:55.900 --> 01:50:59.200
and we have no idea how to stop it.
That's the problem.

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.100
How much time do we have?

01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:08.600
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:11.700
I'll call you back
in two hours.

01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:13.000
Hello?

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:26.400
They just landed
in the desert.

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.400
Good job, David.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.300
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.800
You got it figured out, Father?

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:46.500
This one should be fire.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.900
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.

01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:52.300
The four stones
should go around.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.500
The Fifth Element should be
in the middle...

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.500
and then the weapon
against evil should work.

01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:00.200
You've never seen this work?

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:01.400
Give me that.

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:05.100
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.600
That's it.
That's it.

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.200
Match up the symbols.
Go! Go!

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:18.900
Wind.

01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:22.800
My man, what you doing?

01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.900
- What?
- What you doing?

01:53:26.100 --> 01:53:27.900
Trying to keep you
in the D.J. business.

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:32.600
Fire.

01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:35.300
Done.

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.500
What happens?

01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:39.300
So, now,
we have to open them.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.400
And you know how to do that.
Right?

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:43.800
Theoretically...

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:46.600
No.

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.100
Leeloo, honey, wake up.

01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:54.500
You have to help us.

01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:57.200
How do you open the stones?

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.300
Wind blows.

01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.400
Fire burns.

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:07.000
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.500
Rain...

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.400
falls.

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.200
What does it mean?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.400
I think that--

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:25.700
Maybe it's a charade.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.400
A game or something.

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:30.300
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're dead.

01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:32.000
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.

01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:46.000
Too late.

01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.400
We've lost contact with them.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:50.900
Three minutes.

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:53.700
I think mine is broken.

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:55.400
Why I gotta get
the broke one?

01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:05.600
We're never gonna make it.

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.100
It moved.

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:16.700
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.

01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:18.400
Shut up, shut up!

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:21.600
Show me what you did,
step-by-step.

01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:24.000
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.

01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:28.400
I put my hands on the top
like this, and I said...

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.900
"We're not going to make it."

01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:34.200
And that's it?

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.300
Korben, my man.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:45.900
Wind.

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:49.100
She said, "Wind blows."

01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.600
Everyone take a stone.

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:01.800
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!

01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.400
Earth.

01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.100
Open the other one.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.400
Korben, my man,
I have no fire.

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.800
I have no matches.
Do you have any?

01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:30.300
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:33.200
Got some matches?
We need some fire.

01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:36.200
We're going to die.

01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.800
Don't breathe.

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:05.200
Fire.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
One minute.

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:08.800
Let's go, Leeloo.

01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:12.000
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.

01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:14.200
Protect life...

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:16.700
until death.

01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:18.000
Listen to me!

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:19.700
Listen to me.

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:22.500
Listen,
I know you're very tired.

01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:26.400
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.

01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:28.300
But if you don't
do something right now...

01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.000
we'll all die.

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.900
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.900
It'll enter the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:39.900
You're right.
You're right.

01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:42.200
There are some things...

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:44.700
very nice things worth saving;
beautiful things.

01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.000
Beautiful things.

01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:49.600
Like love?

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:51.800
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.

01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:54.200
That's a good example.
Love is worth saving.

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:56.900
I don't know love.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.300
I don't know love.

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.800
I was built to protect,
not love.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.800
So there's no use for me
other than this.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:10.300
I need you.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.100
I need you,
very much.

01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:15.000
Why?

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.300
Because...

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.000
because...

01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:23.000
Tell her, Korben.

01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.300
Tell me.

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:27.500
Please.

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.500
Why you need me?

01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:31.500
Because...

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:33.200
Tell me.

01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:36.800
- Tell me.
- Because I--

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.500
Because I love you.

01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:41.100
I love you.

01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:45.900
10...

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
9...

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.200
8...

01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:49.200
7...

01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:51.000
6, 5...

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.200
4, 3...

01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:54.600
2...

01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:55.900
1.

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:38.100
Scanner imaging has confirmed
the dark planet dead.

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:41.600
The planet seems to have stopped
at 62 miles from impact.

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.600
What's wrong?
What you screaming for?

01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.300
Every five minutes
it's a bomb or something.

01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.800
I'm leaving.

02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:16.700
Mr. President.

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:19.600
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh
who runs the center.

02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:21.600
It's an honor, Mr. President.

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:23.400
Where are my two heroes?

02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:27.300
They were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor.

02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:29.400
I have 19 meetings after this.

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:32.000
Let me see
if they're revived.

02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.200
Thank you.

02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:35.800
We go live in one minute.

02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:45.000
They're...

02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:47.900
not ready.

02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:50.000
They need...

02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.400
five more minutes.

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.900
You have 20 seconds.

02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:55.300
No, ma'am, I tried.
No, ma'am.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:56.400
Who's that?

02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:58.300
Some woman.
Claims to be Korben's mother.

02:00:58.400 --> 02:00:59.600
Give it here.

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:03.400
Mrs. Dallas,
this is the President.

02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.400
On behalf
of the Federation--

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:07.400
That doesn't
even sound like him.

02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:10.000
The President's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.

02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:11.700
If you don't want to talk
to your mother...

02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:13.400
just avoid me as usual.

02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:17.300
I'll throw myself in traffic.
I'll Saran Wrap myself to the bed.

02:01:18.305 --> 02:01:24.538
