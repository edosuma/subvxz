00:00.585 --> 00:02.451
<i>This season on</i>
"Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:02.453 --> 00:03.163
I've assembled you all

00:03.165 --> 00:04.782
because I need your help.

00:04.784 --> 00:06.318
<i>The future of the world
is in peril</i>

00:06.320 --> 00:08.531
<i>because of Vandal Savage.</i>

00:08.533 --> 00:11.164
<i>You've turned your back
on the very institution</i>

00:11.166 --> 00:12.840
you were meant to serve.

00:12.842 --> 00:14.742
<i>The Time Masters,
they refuse</i>

00:14.744 --> 00:16.309
<i>to take action
against Savage</i>

00:16.312 --> 00:18.245
because he didn't pose a threat
to the timeline.

00:18.247 --> 00:21.015
The Oculus not only
gives us a window into time,

00:21.017 --> 00:23.217
- but the ability to shape it.
- <i>If the Oculus</i>

00:23.219 --> 00:24.852
<i>is what they're using
to control us,</i>

00:24.854 --> 00:26.787
then we need to destroy it.

00:26.789 --> 00:28.589
Shut it down!

00:28.591 --> 00:31.192
There are no strings on me.

00:32.662 --> 00:35.296
He traded his life for ours.
He was a hero.

00:35.298 --> 00:37.798
<i>Unfortunately, Vandal Savage
has already succeeded</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:40.034
<i>in murdering
Miranda and Jonas.</i>

00:40.036 --> 00:42.236
<i>Savage still has
Carter and Kendra.</i>

00:42.238 --> 00:43.571
This is a timeship.

00:43.573 --> 00:45.339
A little gift
from our friends.

00:45.341 --> 00:47.441
I no longer need
to rule the world.

00:47.443 --> 00:50.644
I now have the ability
to change it.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.958 --> 01:04.658
What are we doing
back here?

01:04.660 --> 01:07.828
Savage has a timeship,
courtesy of the Time Masters.

01:07.830 --> 01:09.997
The timeline is unclear,
due to our destruction

01:09.999 --> 01:13.534
of the Oculus, meaning
Savage is lost to history.

01:13.536 --> 01:15.836
Which is why
I brought you all home.

01:15.838 --> 01:18.239
- Mission's not over, man.
- Jax is right.

01:18.241 --> 01:20.474
We've lost Savage before.
We'll find him again.

01:20.476 --> 01:21.876
And then what?
We have no way

01:21.878 --> 01:23.344
of killing Savage,
particularly now

01:23.346 --> 01:24.812
that Kendra and Carter
are in his possession,

01:24.814 --> 01:26.280
assuming that
they're still alive,

01:26.282 --> 01:28.616
- which is highly unlikely.
- So that's it?

01:28.618 --> 01:30.684
- We're... we're just giving up?
- I'm on my way

01:30.686 --> 01:32.620
to the refuge
to retrieve our younger selves

01:32.622 --> 01:34.655
and return them
to the timeline.

01:34.657 --> 01:36.190
It will be as if
you never left.

01:36.192 --> 01:37.491
What, you think
that we can just

01:37.493 --> 01:39.460
return to our old lives,
and then pretend

01:39.462 --> 01:42.062
like none of this
ever happened?

01:42.064 --> 01:44.165
Mm, that might be
a tad difficult.

01:44.167 --> 01:48.435
So I had to bring you back to
May 2016, not January 2016.

01:48.437 --> 01:51.338
Great, so what you're saying
is for the last five months,

01:51.340 --> 01:53.440
my mom probably thinks
that I'm dead.

01:53.442 --> 01:56.744
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Okay, wait, why?

01:56.746 --> 02:00.347
Why the change of plans, Rip?

02:00.349 --> 02:02.149
If you're getting back
on that ship,

02:02.151 --> 02:04.185
we get back on that ship.

02:04.187 --> 02:07.621
In truth,
I never left it.

02:11.660 --> 02:13.561
I'm sorry for all
that I've asked of you,

02:13.563 --> 02:17.865
and that it all
came to nothing.

02:17.867 --> 02:20.501
I wish you all well.

02:26.074 --> 02:27.908
I never liked that guy.

02:35.717 --> 02:40.955
Hello?
Hello?

02:40.957 --> 02:43.557
Dad.

02:43.559 --> 02:45.426
Hey.

02:45.428 --> 02:47.595
- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

02:47.597 --> 02:50.364
- When'd you get back?
- I just got back.

02:50.366 --> 02:52.600
I tried calling,
but nobody was answering.

02:52.602 --> 02:54.768
I was at Laurel's,
but she wasn't there.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.403
Where is everyone?

02:56.405 --> 02:59.540
This, uh, Damien Darhk,

02:59.542 --> 03:01.442
- he's causing problems.
- Well, good to know

03:01.444 --> 03:05.546
nothing's changed
in five months.

03:05.548 --> 03:07.848
Dad?

03:07.850 --> 03:09.083
What's wrong?

03:09.085 --> 03:13.654
Is everything okay?

03:13.656 --> 03:15.322
No, baby.

03:15.324 --> 03:17.057
You're starting
to scare me.

03:21.630 --> 03:26.333
Damien Darhk was in prison,
and he escaped,

03:26.335 --> 03:30.304
and everyone tried to...

03:30.306 --> 03:31.872
stop him.

03:31.874 --> 03:34.708
But your sister, honey,

03:34.710 --> 03:36.944
she, um...

03:36.946 --> 03:39.413
No, Dad.
No.

03:39.415 --> 03:41.849
- I'm sorry, baby.
- No, Dad.

03:41.851 --> 03:44.318
No.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.821
I got you.

03:55.164 --> 03:58.098
You idiot.
We're in the clear.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.266
He was going after us.

03:59.268 --> 04:02.202
On foot.
You shot him,

04:02.204 --> 04:04.772
- and wasted ammo.
- Cops are coming.

04:04.774 --> 04:06.006
You want to
yell at me some more,

04:06.008 --> 04:08.509
or should we both
get out of here?

04:08.511 --> 04:12.146
Neither.

04:14.951 --> 04:16.416
Hey, Mick.

04:16.418 --> 04:17.817
Oh, it... it's me.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.754
It's Ray.

04:20.755 --> 04:23.624
I-I thought
we should talk.

04:23.626 --> 04:25.225
Drive.

04:29.165 --> 04:30.364
Well you didn't
waste any time

04:30.366 --> 04:31.799
getting back
to your old habits.

04:31.801 --> 04:35.536
I like stealing stuff.
It makes me feel good.

04:35.538 --> 04:36.904
Did you ever think
that maybe you weren't meant

04:36.906 --> 04:40.040
to do this anymore?

04:40.042 --> 04:43.644
What do you want,
haircut?

04:43.646 --> 04:47.982
To apologize, sort of.

04:47.984 --> 04:50.517
For Snart.

04:50.519 --> 04:52.353
I was the one who
was supposed to die,

04:52.355 --> 04:55.189
- and I can't help feeling that...
- It wasn't your fault.

04:55.191 --> 04:57.024
It was his.

04:57.026 --> 05:01.095
Son of a bitch never did
anything without a plan.

05:01.097 --> 05:02.563
Maybe you're right.

05:02.565 --> 05:04.331
Maybe he wanted this.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.367
What are you doing
with your hand?

05:06.369 --> 05:09.470
Maybe he wanted us to,
you know,

05:09.472 --> 05:12.039
be partners.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.907
Think I'm going
to be sick.

05:13.909 --> 05:15.209
I think Snart knew.

05:15.211 --> 05:17.111
He knew that
I'd keep an eye out for you,

05:17.113 --> 05:19.380
and you'd keep
an eye out for me.

05:19.382 --> 05:22.116
While doing what?

05:22.118 --> 05:24.385
What we haven't
finished doing.

05:27.923 --> 05:33.660
What was H.G. Wells'
childhood nickname?

05:33.662 --> 05:36.130
- Bertie.
- Incredible.

05:36.132 --> 05:38.332
You've gotten every answer
correct tonight.

05:38.334 --> 05:40.567
Since when did you become
such a history buff?

05:40.569 --> 05:43.704
I guess I developed
a passion for it recently.

05:43.706 --> 05:47.174
During your sabbatical?

05:47.176 --> 05:49.810
You hardly ever
talk about it.

05:49.812 --> 05:53.213
Martin?

05:53.215 --> 05:55.682
I know,
I'm sorry.

05:55.684 --> 06:00.320
My sabbatical was, um...

06:00.322 --> 06:05.926
I left some very important
work unfinished.

06:05.928 --> 06:08.529
Ship's not
going to be here, Gray.

06:08.531 --> 06:10.597
We saw it take off,
remember?

06:10.599 --> 06:15.869
Yes, and in doing so,
it would have left...

06:15.871 --> 06:17.604
Quantum signature.

06:17.606 --> 06:20.407
That's what I've been
trying to tell Mick.

06:20.409 --> 06:22.743
- Radio beacon.
- Quantum entangler.

06:22.745 --> 06:24.545
Boring.

06:24.547 --> 06:27.448
When do we get
in contact with Hunter?

06:29.952 --> 06:31.885
Ms. Lance,
are you all right?

06:31.887 --> 06:34.688
How do we get the Waverider
back here?

06:37.993 --> 06:41.495
- Hi, Daddy, we miss you.
- And love you.

06:41.497 --> 06:44.565
- And love you.
- <i>Captain,</i>

06:44.567 --> 06:46.800
<i>I'm sorry to interrupt.</i>

06:46.802 --> 06:48.635
Tell me
you've located Savage.

06:48.637 --> 06:51.605
<i>No, but we have received
a transmission</i>

06:51.607 --> 06:53.707
<i>from 2016 Star City.</i>

06:56.311 --> 06:58.445
I don't understand.
This should have worked.

06:58.447 --> 07:00.414
Did you account
for subspace interference?

07:00.416 --> 07:02.182
It's the first thing
I thought of.

07:02.184 --> 07:03.851
Did you adjust
for temporal polarity?

07:03.853 --> 07:05.252
Oh, Raymond,
you insult me.

07:05.254 --> 07:07.354
Can you reach
the Waverider or not?

07:07.356 --> 07:10.057
We're working on it.

07:10.059 --> 07:13.894
Actually, guys,
I think it just worked.

07:29.077 --> 07:31.712
I thought I made my intentions
perfectly clear.

07:31.714 --> 07:35.482
And we wish to be
equally clear about ours.

07:35.484 --> 07:37.251
- Do you mind?
- Just checking to see

07:37.253 --> 07:38.452
if you're real this time.

07:38.454 --> 07:40.420
You're not
ditching us again.

07:40.422 --> 07:42.322
When the mission's over,
then we can all go

07:42.324 --> 07:43.991
- our separate ways.
- And this mission

07:43.993 --> 07:45.459
is not over.

07:45.461 --> 07:46.927
Yeah, just curious
how much headway you've had

07:46.929 --> 07:48.929
tracking Savage
without all of us.

07:48.931 --> 07:50.464
None.

07:50.466 --> 07:51.899
But neither
have I got myself

07:51.901 --> 07:53.667
into bar fights
in 1975 and the Old West,

07:53.669 --> 07:56.003
put dwarf star technology
into the hands of terrorists,

07:56.005 --> 07:58.772
or got myself turned into
a scary bird monster.

07:58.774 --> 08:00.707
We get your point.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.142
Now get ours.

08:02.144 --> 08:05.212
That ship's not taking off
without us.

08:05.214 --> 08:08.315
You got that?

08:24.266 --> 08:26.033
- Halt!
- Oh, please don't shoot!

08:26.035 --> 08:27.467
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell are you doing

08:27.469 --> 08:29.803
- out here, lady?
- I was being held captive.

08:29.805 --> 08:31.672
By Nazis?

08:31.674 --> 08:35.609
No, worse.

08:35.611 --> 08:37.010
- Your helmet.
- What about it?

08:37.011 --> 08:39.011
I've seen it before.

08:39.014 --> 08:40.547
Paper, do you have paper?
Something to write with.

08:40.549 --> 08:41.615
Lady, I think
you're in shock.

08:41.616 --> 08:42.916
Please!

08:42.918 --> 08:45.285
Yeah.

08:48.524 --> 08:51.058
So if it wasn't Nazis,
who were you running from?

08:51.060 --> 08:53.393
I need your helmet.

08:53.395 --> 08:55.262
Now!

09:13.882 --> 09:15.649
I'm sorry, my love,

09:15.651 --> 09:19.353
but this game
is not over yet.

09:31.882 --> 09:34.212
Despite my wishes
to pursue Savage alone,

09:34.214 --> 09:35.747
it seems that
you're all intent

09:35.749 --> 09:37.716
on seeing this thing through
till the bitter...

09:37.718 --> 09:40.919
Oh!
Speaking of bitter.

09:40.921 --> 09:42.187
You knew.

09:42.189 --> 09:44.222
You dropped us off
five months later

09:44.224 --> 09:47.092
- because you knew.
- Knew what?

09:47.094 --> 09:50.328
You knew that Laurel
was going to die,

09:50.330 --> 09:53.164
and now you're going
to take me back,

09:53.166 --> 09:56.234
and I'm going to
save my sister.

09:56.236 --> 10:00.305
- I'm afraid that that...
- You should be afraid.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.910
I can't allow you...

10:05.912 --> 10:07.779
I don't care
about the timeline.

10:07.781 --> 10:10.248
You're taking me back now.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.449
Look, Sara,
I'm sure there's

10:11.451 --> 10:12.617
a valid reason
why Rip didn't...

10:12.619 --> 10:13.785
Stay out of this!

10:17.357 --> 10:19.224
What the hell, Rip?

10:19.226 --> 10:22.794
Mr. Rory, take Ms. Lance
to sleep it off.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.562
Not to dismiss
what just happened,

10:24.564 --> 10:26.698
but we do have to
find Savage,

10:26.700 --> 10:28.666
assuming that Kendra and Carter
are still on his timeship.

10:28.668 --> 10:30.568
- He could...
- Be anywhere in time and space.

10:30.570 --> 10:32.704
Oh, well that
narrows it down a lot.

10:35.508 --> 10:40.812
Sorry.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.313
Was this always over here?

10:42.315 --> 10:44.749
No, it lives over...

10:44.751 --> 10:47.752
- Did you put it there?
- Nah, man.

10:47.754 --> 10:52.290
- Did you?
- Dude, it's just a helmet.

10:52.292 --> 10:54.659
- Chronometric repositioning.
- What?

10:54.661 --> 10:56.928
Temporal changes can,
on occasion,

10:56.930 --> 10:58.663
reverberate
through the timeline,

10:58.665 --> 10:59.798
physically moving
an object

10:59.800 --> 11:03.234
from one place
to another.

11:11.912 --> 11:13.645
- Gideon?
- <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

11:13.647 --> 11:18.116
Plot a course
for Saint-Lô, France, 1944.

11:18.118 --> 11:19.417
Why then?

11:19.419 --> 11:22.187
Because that's where
Kendra is.

11:22.189 --> 11:23.455
How is that possible?

11:23.457 --> 11:25.423
She sent us
a message through time.

11:25.425 --> 11:27.425
Go ahead, say it.

11:27.427 --> 11:28.927
Astonishing.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.502
Oh.

11:37.504 --> 11:40.538
I brought you some company.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.540
Oh, he might be
a little disoriented,

11:42.542 --> 11:44.909
after the way
he came out of stasis.

11:44.911 --> 11:48.613
- I know you.
- Oh, you remember her?

11:48.615 --> 11:50.949
Well, his mind
isn't fully gone.

11:50.951 --> 11:53.384
Hey!
Stay away from him!

11:53.386 --> 11:56.221
I'm going to kill you.

11:56.223 --> 11:58.823
You've had 4,000 years
to do so,

11:58.825 --> 12:02.393
with no success.

12:02.395 --> 12:03.595
What are you doing?

12:03.597 --> 12:05.864
Your blood is the key
to unlocking

12:05.866 --> 12:07.899
the Thanagarian technology.

12:07.901 --> 12:11.436
- Thanagarian?
- The alien species which gave

12:11.438 --> 12:14.772
the three of us our powers.

12:14.774 --> 12:16.474
<i>They sent three meteorites</i>

12:16.476 --> 12:20.078
<i>containing technology
beyond human understanding.</i>

12:20.080 --> 12:22.247
<i>When they are activated
by your blood,</i>

12:22.249 --> 12:24.315
I will be able
to erase time itself,

12:24.317 --> 12:26.851
and travel us back
to 1700 B.C.

12:26.853 --> 12:28.820
- No. No!
- I will begin

12:28.822 --> 12:31.589
my immortal life anew,
only this time

12:31.591 --> 12:35.026
I won't be content to whisper in
the ears of powerful men.

12:35.028 --> 12:38.296
This time I will be the one
with the power.

12:38.298 --> 12:40.231
I will be a god.

12:49.809 --> 12:53.011
Please try very hard
not to kill me.

12:54.613 --> 12:57.549
Rip.

12:57.551 --> 13:00.151
Please take me back.

13:00.153 --> 13:01.819
I need your help.

13:01.821 --> 13:03.788
I need to save my sister.

13:03.790 --> 13:06.324
And you know that I would
do this for you, Sara,

13:06.326 --> 13:07.792
but I just can't.

13:07.794 --> 13:11.262
I've not asked you
for anything.

13:11.264 --> 13:13.898
And you of all people
should understand.

13:13.900 --> 13:17.268
You have tried everything.
We... we have tried everything

13:17.270 --> 13:18.870
- to save your family.
- And I would not wish

13:18.872 --> 13:21.873
the pain of that failure
upon anyone.

13:21.875 --> 13:24.275
I would rather live
with that pain than this.

13:24.277 --> 13:25.910
And that's just the thing,
Sara.

13:25.912 --> 13:28.947
Look, if you were able
to try to save Laurel,

13:28.949 --> 13:30.481
then you wouldn't
be alive at all.

13:30.483 --> 13:32.917
Then fine.
I don't care.

13:32.919 --> 13:35.887
When we left,
when I recruited you,

13:35.889 --> 13:38.289
we... we... we altered
the timeline.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.959
Now had it remained the same,
then Damien Darhk would have...

13:40.961 --> 13:42.694
He would have killed

13:42.696 --> 13:46.764
not only you and...
and your sister,

13:46.766 --> 13:49.701
but your father as well.

13:49.703 --> 13:54.005
But, Rip, if... if we go back,

13:54.007 --> 13:55.406
and we take the team...

13:55.408 --> 13:57.408
The outcome would be
exactly the same.

13:57.410 --> 13:59.010
You don't know that.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.878
- I'm afraid that I do.
- No.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.714
I...

14:02.716 --> 14:04.649
There's got to be a way.

14:04.651 --> 14:07.418
Rip, I have to be able
to do something.

14:07.420 --> 14:10.054
I'm so sorry.

14:16.830 --> 14:19.330
Look, I can't.

14:19.332 --> 14:21.232
Can't do this
without my sister.

14:21.234 --> 14:23.401
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

14:23.403 --> 14:28.506
You are one of the strongest
people I have ever met, Sara.

14:30.276 --> 14:34.712
Laurel... Laurel may be
beyond your saving,

14:34.714 --> 14:38.716
but Kendra and Carter,

14:38.718 --> 14:40.451
they might not be.

14:40.453 --> 14:45.556
<i>Captain, we are prepared
to make the time jump to 1944.</i>

14:47.961 --> 14:50.294
We're on our way, Gideon.

15:01.908 --> 15:03.441
<i>We've arrived in Saint-Lô.</i>

15:03.443 --> 15:05.743
<i>No sign of Kendra yet,
but I have located</i>

15:05.745 --> 15:07.412
<i>Vandal Savage,
and he does not</i>

15:07.414 --> 15:09.647
<i>seem to be alone.</i>

15:11.207 --> 15:12.457
_

15:12.967 --> 15:14.777
_

15:15.013 --> 15:18.377
_

15:18.679 --> 15:19.745
_

15:19.816 --> 15:21.851
_

15:33.540 --> 15:36.507
Aah!

15:41.047 --> 15:43.281
Get them!

15:43.283 --> 15:46.718
Aah!

15:46.720 --> 15:49.253
Keep Savage
and our Nazi friends occupied.

15:49.255 --> 15:51.122
Gideon has detected
a temporal signature

15:51.124 --> 15:52.256
consistent with a timeship.

15:52.258 --> 15:53.791
If Kendra and Carter
are alive,

15:53.793 --> 15:56.027
<i>that is where
they're going to be.</i>

15:56.029 --> 15:57.929
Yeah, I see it.

16:08.908 --> 16:11.576
- Jax.
- You miss me?

16:15.248 --> 16:17.548
Is he still nuts?

16:17.550 --> 16:20.785
No, he's okay.

16:20.787 --> 16:23.654
Take this to the ship.

16:34.134 --> 16:37.668
What the hell was that?

16:37.670 --> 16:40.404
<i>You transmuted the molecular
properties of the rifle.</i>

16:40.406 --> 16:42.306
What does that even mean?

16:42.308 --> 16:44.609
Okay, let's get out of here.

16:53.418 --> 16:57.088
Kendra's down.

16:57.090 --> 16:58.956
Rip, we're kind of
outnumbered here.

16:58.958 --> 17:01.025
Fall back.
Staying here to fight Nazis

17:01.027 --> 17:03.427
<i>is exacerbating the damage
that we have already</i>

17:03.429 --> 17:04.628
done to the timeline.

17:04.631 --> 17:06.998
- But Kendra...
- <i>Is alive,</i>

17:07.000 --> 17:08.332
thankfully,
and we will rescue her

17:08.334 --> 17:10.401
in due course.

17:10.403 --> 17:12.136
I hope.

17:23.025 --> 17:26.194
- So this is a spaceship?
- It's a timeship,

17:26.195 --> 17:28.863
but yes, it does also travel
through space.

17:28.865 --> 17:31.032
You... you've seen it before,
Mr. Hall.

17:31.034 --> 17:34.535
That used to be my name.
Carter Hall.

17:34.537 --> 17:36.104
There really is rather a lot
to fill you in on,

17:36.106 --> 17:38.139
and we really do not
have the time.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.240
- What about...
- Kendra, yes,

17:39.242 --> 17:40.341
we need your assistance

17:40.343 --> 17:41.743
in locating her
and Savage.

17:41.745 --> 17:43.278
Perhaps we can start
with what Savage

17:43.280 --> 17:45.380
was doing in 1944.

17:45.382 --> 17:49.851
He said something about, um...
Thanagarian technology.

17:49.853 --> 17:52.086
- Thanagarian...
- The Thanagarians

17:52.088 --> 17:54.656
were race
of extraterrestrials.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.124
He also said
that this technology

17:56.126 --> 17:58.693
was actually
three meteors.

17:58.695 --> 18:00.795
<i>Captain,
I have surveillance footage</i>

18:00.797 --> 18:02.297
<i>which might be relevant.</i>

18:02.299 --> 18:04.932
Thank you, Gideon.

18:04.934 --> 18:07.602
I've seen
that rock before.

18:07.604 --> 18:09.537
Savage had one of those
in 1958.

18:09.539 --> 18:11.739
He took our blood.
He said he would use it

18:11.741 --> 18:13.675
in a ritual to erase time,

18:13.677 --> 18:16.711
take the blood
back to 1700 B.C.

18:22.451 --> 18:23.518
- What are you doing?
- Come on, man.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.786
We got to try it again.

18:24.788 --> 18:26.287
That thing that we did
in World War II.

18:26.289 --> 18:28.956
- It's called transmutation.
- Yeah.

18:28.958 --> 18:30.325
It's a similar process
by which

18:30.327 --> 18:33.094
our uniform materializes
when we merge,

18:33.096 --> 18:34.529
but at the moment,
we need to focus

18:34.531 --> 18:37.131
on figuring out
what Savage is planning.

18:37.133 --> 18:40.668
Come on, just the once.

18:40.670 --> 18:43.571
Is that Raymond and Kendra's
lucky vase?

18:43.573 --> 18:46.507
I don't know, I just found
this junk lying around.

18:46.509 --> 18:48.109
Oh, come on.
Don't you think that

18:48.111 --> 18:49.677
turning something
into something else

18:49.679 --> 18:52.547
might come in handy?

18:52.549 --> 18:55.049
All right, one time only.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.784
Okay, just the once.

18:59.823 --> 19:03.224
All right.

19:07.030 --> 19:08.730
You need to focus, Jefferson.

19:08.732 --> 19:11.032
Why do you always say it
like I'm not focusing?

19:11.034 --> 19:12.934
<i>Just do
what you did before.</i>

19:12.936 --> 19:15.336
Ah, before we had a Nazi
trying to kill us.

19:15.338 --> 19:17.405
This is just a vase.

19:23.079 --> 19:27.582
Come on.

19:29.352 --> 19:31.052
I never thought
I'd utter these words,

19:31.054 --> 19:32.754
but I think
we need a Nazi.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.422
- Not funny.
- Look, the reason I keep

19:34.424 --> 19:36.023
telling you to focus
is because

19:36.025 --> 19:39.160
transmutation is a literal
function of mind over matter.

19:39.162 --> 19:41.429
Dude, this sucks.
Why do I always got to

19:41.431 --> 19:43.364
- be in the driver's seat?
- Oh, don't despair, Jefferson.

19:43.366 --> 19:45.400
This is only
our second attempt

19:45.402 --> 19:46.768
at transmutation,
and, you know,

19:46.770 --> 19:50.872
they always say,
"The third time's a charm."

19:52.207 --> 19:53.741
What?

19:53.743 --> 19:56.944
Third time.
Three rituals.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.747
I-I think I know
what Savage is planning to do.

20:04.053 --> 20:06.921
I figured out how Savage
plans to erase time.

20:06.923 --> 20:09.824
I believe he intends to detonate
each of these meteors

20:09.826 --> 20:11.626
in a different time period.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.994
How can you
destroy the world

20:12.996 --> 20:15.696
three times
in three different times?

20:15.698 --> 20:18.199
You can't, it would create
a temporal paradox.

20:18.201 --> 20:19.567
Which would result
in a timequake

20:19.569 --> 20:21.135
that would return
the Earth to the point

20:21.137 --> 20:23.237
of the first
chronothermic reaction,

20:23.239 --> 20:26.040
- Ancient Egypt.
- Okay, it's official.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.875
This is the craziest
bad guy plan

20:27.877 --> 20:29.477
in the history
of bad guy plans.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.245
I don't think that sanity
is a yardstick

20:31.247 --> 20:33.714
by which Vandal Savage can
be measured.

20:33.716 --> 20:35.383
Okay, so which time periods
are we talking here?

20:35.385 --> 20:37.051
You said Savage
was in possession

20:37.053 --> 20:39.620
of one of these meteorites
in 1958.

20:39.622 --> 20:41.556
That was a year
of a rare alignment,

20:41.558 --> 20:43.224
with the Earth
and Thanagar.

20:43.226 --> 20:45.927
Evidently he got hold of
a second meteorite in 1944.

20:45.929 --> 20:47.895
Which would be
useless to him in a year

20:47.897 --> 20:49.764
where Earth and Thanagar
weren't in alignment.

20:49.766 --> 20:53.034
Now, if my math is correct,
and trust me, it is,

20:53.036 --> 20:55.436
the next two years
that Earth and Thanagar

20:55.438 --> 21:00.241
are in sync
are 1975 and 2021.

21:00.243 --> 21:01.742
But Savage
still has to do this

21:01.744 --> 21:03.911
in three different
time periods.

21:03.913 --> 21:08.049
That's the beauty of
immortality, Jefferson: he can.

21:08.051 --> 21:11.986
<i>He can literally be
in three places at once.</i>

21:27.436 --> 21:30.938
- Can't be.
- Can.

21:30.940 --> 21:34.208
Thanks to time travel,
and it's because of time travel

21:34.210 --> 21:35.810
that I know you're here.

21:35.812 --> 21:38.145
You're out here tonight,
because you have felt

21:38.147 --> 21:40.815
an immanent presence of...

21:40.817 --> 21:42.884
something.

21:42.886 --> 21:45.186
- A... a meteorite?
- And I'm going to give you

21:45.188 --> 21:47.321
a use for it
which will give us the power

21:47.323 --> 21:50.157
to rewrite destiny itself.

21:50.159 --> 21:52.460
Change the course
of the entire world.

22:08.251 --> 22:10.687
So if Savage plans on blowing
up the world three times,

22:10.689 --> 22:12.889
- how do we stop him?
- We don't.

22:12.891 --> 22:14.424
- We kill him.
- How?

22:14.426 --> 22:15.925
We've always known
that only you

22:15.927 --> 22:17.293
or Kendra could kill Savage

22:17.295 --> 22:18.895
using items exposed,
as you were,

22:18.897 --> 22:20.463
to the meteor's radiation.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.865
Now,
the radiation works both ways.

22:21.867 --> 22:23.867
It gave Savage
his immortality, but...

22:23.869 --> 22:25.668
It also makes him
vulnerable.

22:25.670 --> 22:27.437
And Savage
is about to unleash

22:27.439 --> 22:29.472
the radiation
from three meteorites

22:29.474 --> 22:32.041
in three different
time periods.

22:32.043 --> 22:34.244
- Triple the exposure.
- Yes.

22:34.246 --> 22:38.781
Which should be sufficient
to render Savage mortal.

22:38.783 --> 22:41.317
And then all we got to do
is kill Savage three times.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.952
Indeed.
Gideon can navigate

22:42.954 --> 22:43.987
the Waverider,
and we can split

22:43.989 --> 22:45.355
into teams of two.

22:45.357 --> 22:48.424
One in 1958,
one in 1975,

22:48.426 --> 22:51.261
and one in 2021.

22:53.130 --> 22:56.866
Open it.

22:56.868 --> 22:59.569
Did you know that this is one of
the original meteorites

22:59.571 --> 23:02.071
which fell upon
the Middle Kingdom?

23:02.073 --> 23:04.374
Drawn from the ground
after a millennia,

23:04.376 --> 23:07.343
straight into Nazi hands.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.078
The object that has bound
the two of us together

23:09.080 --> 23:11.181
for 4,000 years
has the power

23:11.183 --> 23:15.151
to take us back
to where it all began.

23:15.153 --> 23:18.788
But this time,
I will be the pharaoh,

23:18.790 --> 23:20.990
- and you...
- Will hate you,

23:20.992 --> 23:24.027
like I've always hated you.

23:26.431 --> 23:28.598
Patience, Mr. Hall.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.201
<i>All our teams need to act
simultaneously.</i>

23:36.874 --> 23:38.675
I think that's a comet
or something.

23:38.677 --> 23:42.245
It's a meteorite,
in point of fact.

23:42.247 --> 23:44.614
I was drawn to it as well.

23:47.017 --> 23:48.651
- When can I kill him?
- We have to wait

23:48.653 --> 23:50.954
- for the meteor to go critical.
- When's that?

23:50.956 --> 23:53.556
When he starts the ritual
in all three time periods.

23:55.694 --> 23:58.261
Um, we got
a nuclear bomb, here.

23:58.263 --> 24:00.496
Professor, Jax,
we need you.

24:03.001 --> 24:05.969
Oh, man, I forgot how much
of a badass I was.

24:07.806 --> 24:09.939
Look.

24:13.812 --> 24:15.678
What do you mean
you don't have the money?

24:15.680 --> 24:17.513
I was going to sell
a nuclear warhead

24:17.515 --> 24:20.883
and pay you
out of the profit.

24:20.885 --> 24:22.318
- Things changed.
- You expect me

24:22.320 --> 24:24.320
to just hand
the meteor over for free?

24:36.368 --> 24:41.304
No, I expected
to take it from you by force.

24:47.412 --> 24:48.845
Ah.

25:00.458 --> 25:03.293
Well...
I think that's our cue.

25:05.930 --> 25:07.897
Really?
These guys again?

25:10.535 --> 25:12.735
Now.

25:16.441 --> 25:17.807
Keep them occupied.

25:17.809 --> 25:18.908
You ready to show
these fools

25:18.910 --> 25:20.009
what's really good?

25:20.011 --> 25:22.111
You have no idea.

25:25.817 --> 25:29.719
Glad we're past the point
of worrying about the timeline.

25:39.798 --> 25:41.364
Carter!

25:42.866 --> 25:44.834
Aah!

25:50.809 --> 25:53.142
Ah.

25:57.916 --> 25:59.916
Oh, you're too late.

25:59.918 --> 26:03.252
Time Master's never late.

26:17.602 --> 26:18.601
Rip!

26:18.603 --> 26:20.636
Aah!

27:30.341 --> 27:32.275
You can't kill me.

27:32.277 --> 27:33.910
I'm immortal.

27:33.912 --> 27:36.279
Guess you haven't
heard the news.

27:37.949 --> 27:41.884
Good-bye,
my love.

27:49.727 --> 27:51.360
Aah!

27:53.398 --> 27:56.799
Aah!
Oh!

27:56.801 --> 27:58.835
Ah, you can feel it,
can't you?

27:58.837 --> 28:00.403
Things are different
this time.

28:02.474 --> 28:05.775
- You're mortal.
- But yet, my death

28:05.777 --> 28:09.912
does not save the lives
of your family.

28:09.914 --> 28:12.482
I may die,
but you'll live

28:12.484 --> 28:16.252
knowing that you failed
to save the lives of...

28:16.254 --> 28:17.320
Aah!

28:23.494 --> 28:26.195
Never speak
their names again.

28:53.258 --> 28:54.857
Do something, RoboCop.

28:54.859 --> 28:56.025
I'm on it.
Got a little trick

28:56.027 --> 28:57.026
I've been working on.

29:06.771 --> 29:08.938
Ooh.

29:08.940 --> 29:10.806
<i>It's up to you now,
Jefferson.</i>

29:10.808 --> 29:13.009
Gray, listen.
If we're going to do this,

29:13.011 --> 29:14.544
we got to do it together.

29:14.546 --> 29:16.112
It's going to take
the two of us, all right?

29:16.114 --> 29:19.849
- <i>You're right.</i>
- Okay.

29:21.052 --> 29:23.586
Come on, Gray!

29:31.462 --> 29:34.764
Oh, man.
You got my boots wet.

29:34.766 --> 29:36.032
<i>Jefferson, you did it!</i>

29:36.034 --> 29:37.934
We did it, man.

29:37.936 --> 29:40.703
Gideon,
take us back to Rip.

29:52.650 --> 29:53.783
Damn it!

29:53.785 --> 29:56.218
I wanted to be
the one to kill him.

29:56.220 --> 29:57.820
Again, I mean.

30:00.291 --> 30:02.058
Um...

30:02.060 --> 30:04.126
I don't think
our problems are over yet.

30:10.068 --> 30:11.968
I'm on it.

30:14.639 --> 30:17.607
On what?

30:17.609 --> 30:19.041
It's not working.

30:19.043 --> 30:20.943
<i>The radiation buildup
is too progressive.</i>

30:20.945 --> 30:22.511
I got this.

30:27.585 --> 30:29.785
I don't understand.

30:29.787 --> 30:31.153
I must be all out of power.

30:31.155 --> 30:33.522
What happens if only one of
these goes off?

30:33.524 --> 30:36.509
Uh...
time will remain intact.

30:36.511 --> 30:38.569
The world?

30:38.571 --> 30:40.036
Not so much.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.728
Okay, guys, let's fly
this thing out of here.

30:47.730 --> 30:49.329
To where?
We would never

30:49.331 --> 30:51.165
get it far enough away.

30:51.167 --> 30:52.833
Maybe the Waverider can.

30:52.835 --> 30:54.668
Rip, we need...

30:54.670 --> 30:56.036
Rip?

31:05.280 --> 31:07.381
Rip!
What are you doing?

31:07.383 --> 31:10.117
I'm flying the Waverider
into the sun,

31:10.119 --> 31:13.353
- with the meteor on board.
- <i>And you on it.</i>

31:19.328 --> 31:20.961
I guess this is good-bye.

31:23.999 --> 31:25.532
It's been a pleasure,
Captain.

31:25.534 --> 31:27.100
Likewise, Dr. Palmer.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.902
<i>But you brought us
all into this, man.</i>

31:28.904 --> 31:31.672
Which is why I'm doing this
alone, Mr. Jackson.

31:31.674 --> 31:34.308
I'll have no one else
die for my choices.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.910
This isn't going
to bring Snart back.

31:36.912 --> 31:39.813
I don't want to lose
another friend.

31:39.815 --> 31:42.416
I appreciate that,
Mr. Rory.

31:44.887 --> 31:47.754
<i>I must say, it's been an honor
to serve as your cap...</i>

32:24.292 --> 32:25.826
Rip.

32:29.330 --> 32:30.931
Daddy?

32:48.284 --> 32:50.784
Miranda.

33:43.669 --> 33:44.903
I...

33:44.905 --> 33:46.204
Where...

33:46.206 --> 33:49.708
<i>I'm still here, Captain.</i>

33:49.710 --> 33:51.143
I know you are, Gideon.

33:51.145 --> 33:53.845
<i>May I share something
with you?</i>

33:53.847 --> 33:56.081
<i>I'm not ready to die.</i>

33:57.917 --> 34:00.619
Me neither.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.020
Which reminds me...

34:02.022 --> 34:03.588
Is our solar ray
still functional?

34:03.590 --> 34:05.057
<i>In fact,
it's operating</i>

34:05.059 --> 34:07.893
<i>at an efficiency rate
of 12,000%.</i>

34:07.895 --> 34:11.029
Transfer all available power
to the time drive.

34:11.031 --> 34:12.664
Get ready
to eject the meteor,

34:12.666 --> 34:15.734
and pray that we have enough
power for one

34:15.735 --> 34:17.702
last jump.

34:19.273 --> 34:22.373
What happens if only one of
these goes off?

34:22.376 --> 34:24.909
Our time
will remain intact.

34:24.911 --> 34:28.246
The world, not so much.

34:28.248 --> 34:30.382
Okay, guys, let's fly
this thing out of here.

34:30.384 --> 34:31.949
To where?
We'd never get it

34:31.952 --> 34:35.053
- far enough away.
- Maybe the Waverider can.

34:35.054 --> 34:37.255
Rip, we need...
where's Rip?

34:37.257 --> 34:39.891
And the meteorite?

34:45.531 --> 34:48.132
Will somebody please tell me
what just happened?

34:49.635 --> 34:50.902
Rip?

34:50.904 --> 34:53.538
Sorry if I gave you all
a fright.

34:53.540 --> 34:55.005
What happened
to the meteor?

34:55.007 --> 34:57.542
Uh, I flew it into
the heart of the sun.

34:57.544 --> 35:00.579
Well, I angled the ship
to eject the meteorite

35:00.581 --> 35:02.747
before impact,
and then, uh...

35:02.749 --> 35:04.282
time jumped away.

35:04.284 --> 35:06.551
- You could have been killed.
- Should have been.

35:06.553 --> 35:08.954
You're a moron.

35:08.956 --> 35:12.858
Now, who fancies
a return trip to 2016?

35:16.896 --> 35:19.731
- I can't believe it's over.
- Well, for some of you, yes.

35:19.733 --> 35:23.635
My journey, it seems,
is only just beginning.

35:23.637 --> 35:26.938
How does that work?
Savage is three times dead.

35:26.940 --> 35:29.074
The Time Masters are no longer
of growing concern,

35:29.076 --> 35:31.476
due to our destruction
of the Oculus.

35:31.478 --> 35:34.613
Someone needs to be responsible
for protecting the timeline.

35:34.615 --> 35:36.748
Who better than
a former Time Master?

35:36.750 --> 35:40.185
And any of you
who'd like to join me.

36:00.374 --> 36:04.509
I should stay
and help you with Darhk.

36:04.511 --> 36:08.580
And get justice for Laurel.

36:08.582 --> 36:11.016
That's happening, honey,
with or with out you.

36:11.018 --> 36:12.551
I promise.

36:12.553 --> 36:13.818
Uh, listen,
I-I can't pretend

36:13.820 --> 36:16.521
to understand this
time travel thing,

36:16.523 --> 36:20.025
but it sounds important.

36:20.027 --> 36:22.427
So is family.

36:32.739 --> 36:37.442
I wasn't going to go
the first time.

36:37.444 --> 36:40.111
Then Laurel convinced me.

36:44.151 --> 36:48.053
And now I'm going
to do this for her.

36:50.424 --> 36:52.390
Well, she'd be proud of you.

36:52.392 --> 36:54.159
How do you know?

36:54.161 --> 36:56.094
'Cause I am.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.468
What German lone word
literally means

37:03.470 --> 37:06.571
- "the desire to hike"?
- Wanderlust.

37:06.573 --> 37:08.240
A word which could
also be used

37:08.242 --> 37:11.409
to describe that look
in your eye.

37:11.411 --> 37:13.945
- What look in my eye?
- Martin, we've been married

37:13.947 --> 37:15.847
for 28 years,
and you're still

37:15.849 --> 37:17.415
a lousy liar.

37:17.417 --> 37:19.484
Now about
this new sabbatical.

37:19.486 --> 37:23.989
I decided to decline
the invitation.

37:23.991 --> 37:27.459
But... I think you should.

37:27.461 --> 37:29.327
I-I think... I think
it's important...

37:29.329 --> 37:30.528
Clarissa,
I'm not leaving you.

37:30.530 --> 37:33.898
That's final.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.767
- Hey, Gray.
- What are you...

37:35.769 --> 37:37.869
I'm so glad
that you could make it, Jax.

37:37.871 --> 37:39.104
What are you up to?

37:39.106 --> 37:40.972
Well,
we had a nice, long talk

37:40.974 --> 37:43.475
- this afternoon, didn't we?
- Yeah.

37:43.477 --> 37:45.944
Oh, my God,
this is an intervention!

37:45.946 --> 37:48.246
Yeah, you could
kind of call it that.

37:48.248 --> 37:50.215
Listen, Gray,
you're meant for more

37:50.217 --> 37:54.119
than sitting around answering
trivia questions about history.

37:54.121 --> 37:56.955
Me, you, Firestorm.

37:56.957 --> 37:59.324
We're made for
changing history.

37:59.326 --> 38:01.626
- This is my life.
- And your life

38:01.628 --> 38:04.929
will be waiting for you
when you get back.

38:04.931 --> 38:06.531
You really want me
to do this?

38:06.533 --> 38:10.502
I could never forgive myself
if I kept you from it,

38:10.504 --> 38:13.405
my husband the superhero.

38:42.368 --> 38:45.403
Why are you
looking at me like that?

38:45.405 --> 38:46.905
Wasn't sure you'd make it.

38:46.907 --> 38:49.374
You left me a message,
I came.

38:49.376 --> 38:50.775
What of it?

38:50.777 --> 38:54.546
I just wanted to talk.

38:56.415 --> 39:00.285
You and I,
we've done a lot of thieving,

39:00.287 --> 39:02.620
a lot of cool stuff,
a lot of fun.

39:04.223 --> 39:07.692
Anyway, I, uh...

39:07.694 --> 39:08.760
I just wanted
to make sure

39:08.762 --> 39:10.061
I said something important

39:10.063 --> 39:14.032
that wasn't left unsaid.

39:14.034 --> 39:17.068
Mick, I don't do
touchy-feely.

39:17.070 --> 39:21.106
If you got something to say,
say it.

39:22.074 --> 39:24.275
This wasn't a good idea.

39:29.883 --> 39:32.484
You're the best guy
I ever knew.

39:32.486 --> 39:33.818
You may not think
you're a hero,

39:33.820 --> 39:37.822
but you're a hero to me.

39:41.762 --> 39:44.129
You got that?

39:44.131 --> 39:47.265
Yeah, I got it.

39:47.267 --> 39:49.367
See you around.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.851
You okay?

40:06.853 --> 40:08.353
Fine.

40:08.355 --> 40:10.555
- So did you tell him?
- That he killed himself

40:10.557 --> 40:12.190
to save our destinies?

40:12.192 --> 40:13.892
If it's any consolation,

40:13.894 --> 40:15.126
I can always
bring you back

40:15.128 --> 40:17.896
to this particular time
and place.

40:17.898 --> 40:22.100
I'm fine.
Just let it be.

40:35.247 --> 40:37.081
A full compliment.

40:37.083 --> 40:38.516
To be honest,
I had my doubts

40:38.518 --> 40:39.751
that all of you
would be willing

40:39.753 --> 40:42.053
to throw in with me
for a second go.

40:42.055 --> 40:46.090
- Well, actually...
- We're not coming with you.

40:46.092 --> 40:49.027
With Savage gone,
we want to start fresh,

40:49.029 --> 40:50.128
see what happens.

40:50.130 --> 40:53.331
I give it three months, tops.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.000
Look, I just...

40:56.002 --> 41:00.572
I want to say thank you.
To all of you.

41:00.574 --> 41:02.807
- Ray, I...
- No.

41:02.809 --> 41:05.276
This is...
it's meant to be.

41:05.278 --> 41:08.446
I wish both of you
nothing but the best.

41:15.989 --> 41:18.556
Be safe.

41:18.558 --> 41:21.226
See you guys around.

41:29.336 --> 41:31.836
Every time they do that,

41:31.838 --> 41:35.507
I get hungry for chicken.

41:35.509 --> 41:39.444
So, shall we?

41:45.284 --> 41:47.318
- Is that...
- The Waverider.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.587
Another Waverider?

41:49.589 --> 41:52.724
Whatever it is,
it's not slowing down.

41:52.726 --> 41:55.994
Get down!

41:59.632 --> 42:01.199
What the hell's going on?

42:01.201 --> 42:05.236
To be honest, Mr. Jackson,
I have absolutely no idea.

42:11.710 --> 42:15.079
Is this 2016?

42:15.081 --> 42:18.283
Is this May, 2016?

42:18.285 --> 42:19.817
Yeah.

42:19.819 --> 42:23.588
You're exactly where
you said you'd be.

42:23.590 --> 42:27.725
Do not get on that ship.

42:27.727 --> 42:30.895
If you do,
you're all dead.

42:30.897 --> 42:32.263
Says who?

42:32.265 --> 42:34.532
Says you, Mr. Rory.

42:34.534 --> 42:36.601
You sent me.

42:36.603 --> 42:38.469
I'm sorry.

42:38.471 --> 42:40.772
Who exactly are you?

42:44.077 --> 42:46.177
My name is Rex Tyler.
