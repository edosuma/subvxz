00:02.027 --> 00:03.343
(crying)
Emma, stop, stop, stop.

00:06.915 --> 00:09.900
Emma's left the building.

00:12.070 --> 00:14.688
She say anything about me?

00:14.706 --> 00:17.708
No, why would she?
Because I kissed her.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.879
(school bell ringing)
ARTIE: Mr. Shue, Finn,

00:21.913 --> 00:24.365
thank you for agreeing
to this sit-down.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.201
We've all noticed the tension
between you ever since Finn

00:27.235 --> 00:29.503
admitted he kissed
Miss Pillsbury.

00:29.537 --> 00:31.055
Sorry I'm late.
Huge line up at the Lima Bean,

00:31.089 --> 00:34.374
but here are the lattes that
Mr. Shue made me get everybody.

00:34.393 --> 00:37.678
Um, I asked for two pumps
of mocha, Finn.

00:37.712 --> 00:40.314
I taste three. Take 'em back.

00:40.348 --> 00:43.017
All of them.

00:43.051 --> 00:45.385
I'm sorry, Mr. Shue, but all
I did was pick up the vests.

00:45.404 --> 00:47.321
I didn't... What's most
upsetting is you actually think

00:47.355 --> 00:48.722
these vests are clean,

00:48.740 --> 00:52.660
that it's okay
to turn in subpar work.

00:52.694 --> 00:54.361
No surprise.
Finn has been acting

00:54.396 --> 00:56.063
like he's losing his mind.

00:56.081 --> 00:57.731
Great job, Ryder!
See that, guys?

00:57.749 --> 01:00.234
Prowess on the football field
<i>and</i> a terrific singing voice

01:00.252 --> 01:03.170
are not mutually exclusive.
I can't take it anymore!

01:03.205 --> 01:05.673
Okay, it's bad enough you're
treating me like your lackey,

01:05.707 --> 01:08.092
but I'm not gonna sit here
while you fake-compliment Ryder

01:08.126 --> 01:10.127
just to hurt me!

01:13.748 --> 01:16.750
(school bell ringing) You're feuding.
And it needs to stop.

01:16.768 --> 01:19.019
Seriously. It's like
Hatfields and McCoys in here.

01:19.054 --> 01:21.439
So epic musical feuds
is our theme.

01:21.473 --> 01:23.858
And for the first time in Glee
Club history, we are giving you

01:23.892 --> 01:25.526
our fearless leaders,
an assignment.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.862
You two will explore
and resolve your differences

01:27.896 --> 01:29.429
by performing a song together

01:29.448 --> 01:32.550
inspired
by a classic musical rivalry.

01:32.584 --> 01:34.368
Guys...
Regionals are coming up,

01:34.402 --> 01:36.570
Mr. Shue, and if we're gonna
have any chance of winning,

01:36.605 --> 01:37.472
we need both of you.

01:37.499 --> 01:40.008
On the same page and
on the same team.

(sighs)

01:52.304 --> 01:53.754
False alarm.

01:53.788 --> 01:55.756
Thank God. I'm so happy.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.424
I'm so glad
this is all over with.

01:57.458 --> 02:00.761
Thank you
for taking me here today.

02:00.795 --> 02:02.462
All right,
I'm gonna go to class.

02:02.481 --> 02:05.232
Whoa, hey. That's it?

02:05.267 --> 02:07.234
That's all you have
to say about this?

02:07.269 --> 02:10.137
Well, the doctor gave me the
all-clear. What else is there?

02:10.155 --> 02:13.324
Rachel, you can't just blow past
this like nothing ever happened.

02:14.826 --> 02:16.810
This is a wake-up call.
This is an opportunity

02:16.828 --> 02:18.812
for you to take a hard look
at the choices

02:18.830 --> 02:20.831
that you're making,
where your life is heading.

02:22.284 --> 02:24.668
Starting with Donkey Face.

02:32.627 --> 02:35.763
Hey, I'm Dallas.
What's your name?

02:35.797 --> 02:37.932
Uh, Gunnar.

02:37.966 --> 02:38.933
(chuckles) Dude, relax.

02:38.967 --> 02:41.268
I've seen you here
the past few weeks.

02:41.303 --> 02:44.605
Look around.
We're not exactly alone.

02:44.639 --> 02:47.858
Look, this isn't a
real thing for me, okay?

02:47.893 --> 02:51.779
It's... I need it
for my tuition, you know?

02:51.813 --> 02:55.950
Hey, man, I'm sure everyone
has a legit reason to be here.

02:55.984 --> 02:57.851
Speaking of.
We'll talk about it.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.477
(bell ringing)

05:36.511 --> 05:38.862
Young Burt Reynolds,
may I gently remind you

05:38.897 --> 05:42.449
that on Wednesday, December 5,
you joined the Cheerios!

05:42.484 --> 05:44.868
But you've been conspicuously
absent from practice

05:44.903 --> 05:47.454
since Thursday, December 6.

05:47.489 --> 05:49.840
We've told you,
we only joined for a day

05:49.874 --> 05:51.625
when we thought
Glee Club was disbanding.

05:51.659 --> 05:54.461
And yet you signed
this legally binding contract

05:54.496 --> 05:59.967
that clearly states
on page 43, paragraph 7C-9:

06:00.001 --> 06:03.137
"Blaine Devon Anderson will
provide said Cheerios! Duty

06:03.171 --> 06:05.789
"at any and all pep rallies,
assemblies, town meetings,

06:05.824 --> 06:08.475
"state fairs, concerts,
television programs,

06:08.510 --> 06:10.177
"motion pictures, video games,

06:10.211 --> 06:11.462
Republican national
conventions..."

06:11.496 --> 06:13.147
I never signed that.

06:13.181 --> 06:16.850
Well, that's funny, because
your signature says you did.

06:17.902 --> 06:19.737
That's a forgery.
And you can't prove that.

06:19.771 --> 06:20.821
I probably could.

06:20.855 --> 06:23.157
Cheerios! Regionals
is fast approaching,

06:23.191 --> 06:25.325
and I need a shiny,
sexually non-threatening gay

06:25.360 --> 06:26.994
to hoist up some
of the most gorgeous girls

06:27.028 --> 06:28.529
in America over his head,

06:28.563 --> 06:31.331
have a bird's-eye view
of their baby oven,

06:31.366 --> 06:33.333
and not be even remotely
interested.

06:33.368 --> 06:34.835
And that would be you.

06:34.869 --> 06:37.904
Thank you, but I'm just
too busy with Glee Club

06:37.922 --> 06:39.506
and Student Council.

06:39.541 --> 06:41.842
If you need me back,
I guess I could do it.

06:41.876 --> 06:43.610
Why are you even here?

06:43.645 --> 06:45.162
You called me out of class.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.163
You're dismissed.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.331
Go find a new boyfriend.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.766
Maybe Lance Bass is available.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.185
Or RuPaul.

06:51.219 --> 06:52.186
Suit up, soldier.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.687
I'll help you put it on.

06:53.721 --> 06:56.356
No, thank you, Becky. I'm-I'm
not rejoining the Cheerios!

06:56.391 --> 06:57.674
Oh, you most certainly are.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.244
Or something very unfortunate
will most likely

07:00.278 --> 07:03.263
be happening to you
extremely soon.

07:03.281 --> 07:05.182
Are you threatening me?

07:05.216 --> 07:06.450
Uh, yeah!

07:06.484 --> 07:08.285
Get moving, beeyatch!

07:12.824 --> 07:16.877
<i>Last questions:</i>
<i>Bear versus shark?</i>

07:16.911 --> 07:18.695
KATIE:
<i>Bear.</i>

07:18.730 --> 07:20.380
<i>Onion rings versus</i>
<i>French fries?</i>

07:20.415 --> 07:22.616
KATIE: <i>French fries are
the world's best food.</i>

07:22.650 --> 07:24.485
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>you could put up</i>

07:24.519 --> 07:26.186
<i>against French fries</i>
<i>that could win.</i>

07:33.144 --> 07:34.261
<i>I swear those are all</i>

07:34.295 --> 07:36.096
<i>the exact same answers</i>
<i>I would have given.</i>

07:36.130 --> 07:37.314
KATIE:
<i>Soul mates!</i>

07:37.348 --> 07:39.633
<i>I can't believe we've only</i>
<i>known each other for a week.</i>

07:41.269 --> 07:44.655
<i>And I'm so glad you can look</i>
<i>beyond my spelling mistakes.</i>

07:44.689 --> 07:45.772
(both chuckle)

07:45.806 --> 07:47.741
<i>It feels like so much more</i>
<i>than that, though.</i>

07:47.775 --> 07:50.143
<i>I mean, in a week,</i>
<i>I feel like I've told you</i>

07:50.161 --> 07:52.513
<i>more than I've told to anyone</i>
<i>else in my entire life.</i>

07:52.547 --> 07:54.481
<i>Uh, yeah. No. Me, too.</i>

07:54.499 --> 07:56.650
<i>You even know</i>
<i>about my</i> Star Wars <i>sheets.</i>

07:56.668 --> 07:58.235
(Katie laughs)

07:58.269 --> 08:00.270
<i>Anything interesting</i>
<i>happening at school today?</i>

08:02.123 --> 08:03.841
<i>You could say that...</i>

08:03.875 --> 08:04.875
Hello, poser.

08:06.494 --> 08:07.761
Say what?

08:07.795 --> 08:09.829
Say what a jerk-knuckle you are
for messing with my girl

08:09.848 --> 08:12.099
and putting that big old
square head in her face.

08:12.133 --> 08:14.184
Marley likes Jake.

08:14.219 --> 08:16.603
And we in Glee Club
like that two-for-one combo.

08:16.638 --> 08:18.372
This is kind of none
of your business.

08:18.406 --> 08:20.190
Did you not notice that I'm
sitting on different sides

08:20.225 --> 08:21.841
of the choir room.
He won't speak to her.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.277
Dude, back off.

08:23.311 --> 08:25.362
Who are you calling a dude?
I am no dude.

08:25.396 --> 08:28.649
So what are you then?
I am a proud black woman.

08:30.318 --> 08:31.902
No, you're a dude.

08:33.488 --> 08:35.272
<i>He was way out of line.</i>

08:35.306 --> 08:37.791
KATIE: <i>Didn't you tell me it
was Feud Week in Glee Club?</i>

08:37.825 --> 08:39.793
<i>Well, get your aggression</i>
<i>out through song.</i>

08:39.827 --> 08:41.128
<i>Challenge him to a duel.</i>

08:41.162 --> 08:44.298
<i>Has anyone ever told you</i>
<i>you're kind of a genius?</i>

08:44.332 --> 08:47.367
KATIE (chuckles):
Later, baby.

08:49.604 --> 08:50.554
(bell ringing)

08:50.588 --> 08:51.838
(Will claps hands once)

08:51.872 --> 08:53.540
We need
to do something muscular,

08:53.558 --> 08:56.143
like Biggie versus Tupac.
Now, we know how that ended.

08:56.177 --> 09:00.647
Look, we don't need to do this
stupid assignment, Mr. Shue.

09:00.682 --> 09:02.649
Don't act like you're above
these kids, Finn.

09:02.684 --> 09:04.685
Not that long ago,
you were one of them.

09:04.719 --> 09:06.303
We can just talk.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.690
(chuckles) Unless you have
some stunning new revelation

09:09.724 --> 09:12.075
about why you kissed
my bride-to-be,

09:12.110 --> 09:15.362
I've already heard everything
you have to say.

09:15.396 --> 09:18.615
Besides, I don't think
you could take it.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.402
I can take it.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.737
Okay.

09:28.126 --> 09:30.594
I put you in charge
of the Glee Club, Finn...

09:30.628 --> 09:33.547
not because you were
a national champion

09:33.581 --> 09:35.182
and not because
you were qualified

09:35.216 --> 09:36.750
with something
like a teaching degree,

09:36.768 --> 09:38.585
or even a single college credit,

09:38.603 --> 09:39.853
for that matter.

09:39.887 --> 09:41.755
I gave you the Glee Club
because you were lost;

09:41.773 --> 09:43.757
You just got dumped
by your girlfriend;

09:43.775 --> 09:45.192
You flunked out of the army;

09:45.226 --> 09:48.261
And the real truth is
I just took pity on you.

09:48.279 --> 09:50.297
Wow.

09:50.331 --> 09:52.599
Yeah. You wanted to talk.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.267
Yeah, I did,
but I didn't think...

09:54.285 --> 09:56.403
So I put all this trust in you

09:56.437 --> 09:58.772
so that you can get back
on your feet,

09:58.790 --> 09:59.906
and what do you do?

09:59.940 --> 10:02.776
You betray me
in the worst way possible.

10:03.795 --> 10:05.862
You broke the code
of a brother, Finn.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.799
I know that.
And I'm so sorry.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.550
Sorry's not gonna cut it.

10:10.585 --> 10:14.137
So start thinking of some
of the nastiest music feuds

10:14.172 --> 10:15.589
you can come up with

10:15.623 --> 10:18.158
because we are doing
this assignment.

10:18.192 --> 10:20.844
And I'm gonna kick your ass.

10:31.437 --> 10:33.571
Well, well, well, I see

10:33.606 --> 10:35.490
that of Donkey Face's crap
is still here.

10:35.524 --> 10:37.075
And if Donkey Face's crap
is here,

10:37.109 --> 10:38.910
then that means that
he must be as well.

10:38.944 --> 10:40.361
Lay off of it,
Santana, all right?

10:40.395 --> 10:42.897
I told you, he said
that he got a job

10:42.915 --> 10:44.499
as a cater waiter on the side,

10:44.533 --> 10:46.567
and he was embarrassed about it,
so he kept it a secret.

10:46.585 --> 10:48.586
Why? I mean, if he can
make that much cash

10:48.621 --> 10:50.905
slinging sweaty cold cuts

10:50.923 --> 10:53.574
and room temp champagne,
then we should all apply there.

10:53.592 --> 10:55.543
Hey, look, he's just trying
to make it in New York

10:55.577 --> 10:57.411
the same way that you and I are.

10:57.429 --> 10:59.430
I don't why that is so hard
for you to understand.

10:59.465 --> 11:01.299
You keep trying
to bring him down.

11:03.418 --> 11:06.387
Look, at this point it's less
about him than it is about you.

11:06.421 --> 11:08.056
I went to school
with Rachel Berry.

11:08.090 --> 11:11.059
Not the soggy mess of a woman
that stands before me today,

11:11.093 --> 11:13.611
going back and forth between
your flop high school ex

11:13.646 --> 11:16.597
and that terrifying
"waiter with a pager."

11:18.984 --> 11:21.035
You need to stop
and focus, Berry.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.403
I think you're wrong about him.

11:22.437 --> 11:25.707
My psychic Mexican third eye
is never wrong.

11:25.741 --> 11:27.742
Am I wrong about you?

11:32.631 --> 11:35.616
BRODY:

11:35.634 --> 11:38.586
♪ I'm the type

(school bell rings)

11:47.680 --> 11:49.480
(knocks on window) You!

11:49.515 --> 11:50.982
I know you're behind this.

11:51.016 --> 11:54.485
Sorry I yelled,
Gay Blaine, here.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.155
Oh, Cover Boy hair gel.

11:57.189 --> 11:58.306
This is really expensive.

11:58.324 --> 11:59.607
Thanks, Becky.

11:59.641 --> 12:01.442
It's cement.

12:01.476 --> 12:02.577
(thuds)

12:02.611 --> 12:04.245
And someone took out
30 credit cards

12:04.280 --> 12:06.080
and a house loan in my name.

12:06.115 --> 12:09.117
My identity's been stolen.
My parents' credit is ruined.

12:09.151 --> 12:10.668
Only for seven years.

12:10.703 --> 12:12.620
But that sign.

12:12.654 --> 12:13.955
That sign!

12:13.989 --> 12:15.990
(laughter)

12:19.328 --> 12:21.095
Come on.

12:21.130 --> 12:23.464
That's completely inexcusable.

12:23.498 --> 12:25.016
And it's not true.

12:25.050 --> 12:27.635
Not really... this officially
a feud between you and me.

12:27.669 --> 12:29.187
And there's only one way
to solve it.

12:29.221 --> 12:32.307
A sing-off featuring the music
of two feuding superstars?

12:32.341 --> 12:34.192
Oh, I read all about it

12:34.226 --> 12:36.110
in WhoGivesACrap.biz.

12:36.145 --> 12:38.980
Fine. Nicki Minaj
versus Mariah Carey.

12:39.014 --> 12:40.315
I will sing Nicki,

12:40.349 --> 12:41.983
due to my Trinidad roots.

12:42.017 --> 12:43.451
And if you win the challenge,

12:43.485 --> 12:45.436
I'll tear up your
Cheerios! Contract.

12:45.471 --> 12:46.621
Fine, perfect.

12:46.655 --> 12:48.640
But that will never,
ever happen

12:48.691 --> 12:50.608
because you are looking
into the face of...

12:50.643 --> 12:52.259
Evil.

12:52.278 --> 12:53.995
I was going to say
high school cheerleading

12:54.029 --> 12:56.698
national champion,
but thank you.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.032
(school bell rings)

12:59.702 --> 13:01.619
(sighs)

13:01.654 --> 13:03.955
I don't think it's fair that
you're pissed at me about this.

13:03.989 --> 13:06.607
I didn't do anything.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.126
You let him kiss you.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.211
What was I supposed to do?

13:10.245 --> 13:12.279
It's not like he took
a running start.

13:12.298 --> 13:13.464
You're supposed
to not let him think

13:13.499 --> 13:14.949
that it was even a possibility.

13:14.967 --> 13:17.585
Fine, I'll own that.

13:19.004 --> 13:20.338
I haven't minded the fact

13:20.389 --> 13:21.639
that both of you are into me.

13:21.674 --> 13:23.474
And I certainly
didn't discourage him,

13:23.509 --> 13:24.642
which wasn't fair to him

13:24.677 --> 13:26.177
or to you.

13:27.680 --> 13:28.980
But are you telling me
that you've

13:29.014 --> 13:31.465
completely stopped flirting
with other girls?

13:31.483 --> 13:32.967
I would never do anything.

13:32.985 --> 13:35.236
So if some Cheerio you're
uncontrollably flirting with

13:35.270 --> 13:36.971
suddenly decides to kiss you,
you're just gonna

13:36.989 --> 13:39.324
backflip out of the way
before her lips

13:39.358 --> 13:41.576
touch yours?

13:41.610 --> 13:43.144
(both laugh)

13:43.162 --> 13:45.663
So what are we even
talking about here?

13:45.698 --> 13:48.583
Are you seriously worried that
I'm gonna leave you for Ryder?

13:49.618 --> 13:51.986
I don't know.
I mean, he kicked butt

13:52.004 --> 13:53.204
with all this
Valentine's Day stuff

13:53.255 --> 13:55.173
and he's like two inches taller
than what I am.

13:55.207 --> 13:56.424
(laughs):
I'm not.

13:56.458 --> 13:57.542
I won't.

13:58.711 --> 14:01.512
I love you
and that means something to me.

14:01.547 --> 14:03.348
It's not just words.

14:03.382 --> 14:06.601
Well, are you afraid that
I'm gonna leave you for someone?

14:06.635 --> 14:08.519
Not as much anymore.

14:08.554 --> 14:10.888
Good.

14:10.939 --> 14:13.391
Because it's me and you
against the world.

14:14.643 --> 14:15.860
Especially Ryder.

14:15.894 --> 14:18.112
I mean, I thought he was
a good dude, but...

14:18.147 --> 14:19.447
he's not a friend.

14:19.481 --> 14:20.948
You need to ice him out.

14:20.983 --> 14:22.283
I can't do that.

14:23.152 --> 14:25.036
I mean, you can stay mad at him

14:25.070 --> 14:27.622
if you want, but I have
to be more forgiving.

14:27.656 --> 14:28.906
How can you do that to me?

14:28.957 --> 14:30.691
It's gonna tick me off
every time I see you

14:30.709 --> 14:32.577
talking to him.
Do you trust me?

14:32.628 --> 14:34.629
Do you believe that I love you?

14:34.663 --> 14:36.964
Yes, but...

14:36.999 --> 14:38.633
Then it doesn't matter
who I talk to.

14:38.667 --> 14:41.052
Because no matter
where I am or what I'm doing,

14:41.086 --> 14:43.554
I'm with you.

14:48.594 --> 14:51.229

17:00.392 --> 17:02.009
What inspired that mashup?

17:02.027 --> 17:03.510
I mean, the thing was feuds
so we just...

17:03.529 --> 17:05.512
So Unique demanded mediation.

17:05.531 --> 17:08.616
Might I suggest doing an
Elton John/Madonna mashup?

17:08.650 --> 17:10.401
Madonna finally forgave
Elton John for calling her

17:10.452 --> 17:11.452
"a fairground stripper"

17:11.486 --> 17:13.354
and saying that
her career was over,

17:13.372 --> 17:15.623
but their decade-long
feud was epic.

17:15.656 --> 17:18.291
Unique is, was, and ever
shall be Madonna.

17:18.327 --> 17:19.292
(laughs)

17:19.328 --> 17:21.546
He can try
to be Sir Elton, but...

17:21.579 --> 17:23.013
you ain't got it.

17:23.048 --> 17:25.465
Well, the awesome things
about feuds is

17:25.500 --> 17:27.551
that once all the anger
has gotten out,

17:27.586 --> 17:30.054
you can shake on it and
let bygones be bygones.

17:30.088 --> 17:33.040
Unique would happily shake
Ryder's hand, but first...

17:33.058 --> 17:34.559
say I'm a girl.

17:35.594 --> 17:37.595
(quiet laugh)

17:37.646 --> 17:40.264
Look, I'm just
so confused, okay?

17:40.315 --> 17:42.233
Yesterday you're dressed
as a boy; today you're a girl.

17:42.267 --> 17:43.651
What-what bathroom
do you use?

17:43.685 --> 17:44.986
I mean, make up your mind.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.404
It doesn't matter what you see.

17:46.438 --> 17:48.606
You don't get to decide for me.

17:51.693 --> 17:54.561
You are a douchebag, dude.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.998
I mean, in this room we can
be whatever we want to be.

17:59.952 --> 18:02.236
(school bell rings)

18:02.254 --> 18:03.504
SUE:
Becky, it's no secret

18:03.538 --> 18:06.591
(sniffs) you are
Nicki Minaj's biggest fan.

18:06.625 --> 18:07.942
Minaj!

18:07.976 --> 18:09.510
Inside voice, Becky.

18:09.544 --> 18:11.128
I need your expert advice.

18:11.163 --> 18:12.263
Now I've got wigs in every shade

18:12.297 --> 18:13.514
of Jell-O,

18:13.548 --> 18:15.516
and costumes
from Lima's Circus Museum,

18:15.550 --> 18:17.902
but if I am going
to win this feud...

18:17.936 --> 18:20.304
and I must win this feud...

18:20.355 --> 18:24.108
I can't just be a mere mirage
of Minaj, no.

18:24.142 --> 18:26.611
I must become her.

18:26.645 --> 18:29.280
Easy, Coach.
Practice your Minaj face.

18:29.314 --> 18:31.598
I think you said,
"Practice your Minaj face."

18:31.617 --> 18:33.200
Excellent.

18:41.493 --> 18:44.111
Great, moving on.
Most important...

18:44.129 --> 18:45.630
I'm one step ahead
of you, Becky.

18:45.664 --> 18:48.466
It's time to perfect my Nicki-
Minaj-where-the-hell-did-that...

18:48.500 --> 18:50.384
come-from-cuckoo-
for-Cocoa-Puffs...

18:50.419 --> 18:52.553
crazy-pants threat.

18:52.587 --> 18:53.554
(school bell rings)

18:53.588 --> 18:55.589
I'm not putting up
with Your Highness.

18:58.560 --> 18:59.977
It's off with your head.

19:00.012 --> 19:01.896
Don't you call me a gangster.
What?

19:01.930 --> 19:03.630
Every time you patronize me,

19:03.649 --> 19:06.067
I will take it back.

19:06.101 --> 19:06.901
Leave me alone.

19:06.935 --> 19:08.569
I will knock you out.

19:10.439 --> 19:11.856
Getting there, Coach.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.651
BRODY: Five, six,
seven, eight.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.977
Two, four,

19:18.995 --> 19:20.979
six...

19:20.997 --> 19:23.281
Come on, guys, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, please.

19:23.315 --> 19:25.667
This is not gonna cut it
with Cassie, okay?

19:25.701 --> 19:27.285
Let's do it from the top.

19:27.319 --> 19:28.820
Just don't get
too close, girls.

19:28.838 --> 19:29.754
Unless you're immune

19:29.789 --> 19:31.756
to the herps.

19:31.791 --> 19:34.317
Take five.

19:34.362 --> 19:36.196
How did you get in here?

19:36.230 --> 19:37.814
Don't apply logic to Lopez.

19:37.865 --> 19:39.199
And if what I just saw
is any indication,

19:39.233 --> 19:40.984
I can get in here
any time I want.

19:41.035 --> 19:43.119
I've got moves your
mannequin ass couldn't handle.

19:43.154 --> 19:45.071
Do you know what
your problem is, Santana?

19:45.105 --> 19:46.990
You're loud and you're rude,

19:47.041 --> 19:49.159

your sketchiness from here.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.050
So let me tell you
how it's gonna be.

19:57.084 --> 19:59.386
You're gonna move out
of our apartment tonight

19:59.420 --> 20:02.756
or I can dig a little deeper
and destroy you.

20:02.790 --> 20:03.790
You're all talk and no proof.

20:03.808 --> 20:04.791
Don't need proof.

20:04.809 --> 20:06.426
I know exactly what you are.

20:06.460 --> 20:09.012
Yo, fly girls, can
I get some backup?

20:09.063 --> 20:10.847

this one should be

20:10.898 --> 20:12.899
in your bones.

for me

Santana, if you'd just take
a seat, please

26:19.371 --> 26:21.606
and join us for a little
family loft conversation.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.191
Creepy,

26:23.225 --> 26:25.143
but okay.

26:25.177 --> 26:27.311
We just got off the phone

26:27.345 --> 26:28.696
with Brody.

26:28.731 --> 26:30.631
Did you confront him

26:30.666 --> 26:33.284
at NYADA with a
Paula Abdul song?

26:33.318 --> 26:34.202
You can't just

26:34.236 --> 26:35.686
march on in there

26:35.704 --> 26:37.288
and like, act all crazy, okay?

26:37.322 --> 26:38.706
We go to school there.

26:38.741 --> 26:41.392
That was the best performance
that place has seen in years.

26:44.246 --> 26:46.364
We want you to move out.

26:46.398 --> 26:49.133
You're joking.

26:49.168 --> 26:50.118
We're not.

26:50.152 --> 26:51.335
(sirens wailing in distance)

26:51.370 --> 26:53.337
Olsen twins,
let me tell you something.

26:53.371 --> 26:55.223
I have known you both
for years,

26:55.257 --> 26:57.308
and I don't like either of you
90% of the time.

26:57.342 --> 27:00.044
In fact, your wide-eyed,
Keane painting approach of life

27:00.062 --> 27:03.848
makes my teeth hurt
and my breasts ache with rage,

27:03.882 --> 27:06.234
but you know what,
I have love for you.

27:07.219 --> 27:08.719
You're my family,

27:08.737 --> 27:10.188
and I haven't lied to you
in months.

27:10.222 --> 27:12.023
I'm smarter about other people
than the both of you.

27:12.057 --> 27:13.324
You have to trust me.

27:13.358 --> 27:15.860
Santana, you're making Brody
feel uncomfortable, okay?

27:15.894 --> 27:18.329
And he was here first,
so you either lay off of it

27:18.363 --> 27:19.396
or you move out.

27:21.617 --> 27:23.668
Fine.

27:23.702 --> 27:25.036
That's fine.

27:25.070 --> 27:26.904
You know what, I don't...
I don't mind going.

27:26.922 --> 27:29.006
I ran into Lena Dunham

27:29.041 --> 27:30.708
at Barney's,

27:30.742 --> 27:33.094
and she told me
that I could crash with her

27:33.128 --> 27:35.096
if I ever needed to,
so that's cool

27:35.130 --> 27:36.848
'cause she has
two Golden Globes.

27:36.882 --> 27:39.250
Oh, you know what,
and another thing.

27:39.268 --> 27:42.120

calls street smarts.

27:43.772 --> 27:45.422
I'm right about plastic man.

27:57.386 --> 27:59.220

she just stole my comforter.

and in-betweeners,

31:52.638 --> 31:53.521
and hag for life,

31:53.556 --> 31:54.839
is how it's done.

31:54.857 --> 31:56.274
Impressive, Sue, both of you.

31:56.308 --> 31:58.142
But Coach Sylvester used like,

31:58.176 --> 31:59.844
feathers and a black light,

31:59.879 --> 32:02.113
and she brought in the Cheerios.
Yeah, that's not fair.

32:02.147 --> 32:04.315
Yes, but nobody ever said
life is fair, Tina.

32:04.349 --> 32:05.867
So, William,

32:05.901 --> 32:07.936
though it's shockingly clear
who the winner is,

32:07.970 --> 32:09.520
would you do the honors,

32:09.538 --> 32:11.372
and unlike that interminably
long voting montage

32:11.407 --> 32:12.790
at the end of <i>Lincoln,</i>

32:12.825 --> 32:14.125
let's make this fast.

32:14.159 --> 32:17.212
Show of hands for
Blaine as Mariah.

32:17.246 --> 32:18.379
Thank you, Tina.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.530
Come on.

32:19.548 --> 32:20.364
Noted.

32:20.382 --> 32:23.034
All in favor of Sue as Nicki?

32:23.052 --> 32:24.802
(chuckles)

32:24.837 --> 32:27.805
Well, I hope you're ready
for some form-fitting polyester,

32:27.840 --> 32:29.007
gay Clark Kent

32:29.041 --> 32:30.475
from season one of <i>Smallville,</i>

32:30.509 --> 32:32.477
because it looks like
you're going to be the bottom

32:32.511 --> 32:36.397
of my Cheerios pyramid
after all.

32:39.518 --> 32:41.519
(school bell ringing)

32:53.565 --> 32:55.950
So you really are leaving?

32:57.069 --> 32:58.336
(sighs)

32:58.370 --> 32:59.454
Yeah.

33:02.407 --> 33:04.842
I just wanted to thank you
for everything

33:04.877 --> 33:06.761
you did for me.

33:12.417 --> 33:13.584
Thank you.

33:16.254 --> 33:17.221
So...

33:17.255 --> 33:18.523
what's next for you?

33:18.557 --> 33:20.108
I don't know.

33:20.142 --> 33:21.425
Probably a lot of long hours

33:21.443 --> 33:22.927
of figuring out
what's next for me.

33:28.450 --> 33:29.450
MARLEY:
Um...

33:30.986 --> 33:32.287
Can I speak freely?

33:32.321 --> 33:35.773
Yeah, sure, I'm not your
commanding officer or anything.

33:35.791 --> 33:37.075
Say whatever you want.

33:37.109 --> 33:40.378
Dude, you really need
to grow a pair.

33:40.412 --> 33:43.131
Maybe you should go back
to not speaking so freely.

33:43.165 --> 33:44.299
I know that

33:44.333 --> 33:46.134
you're feeling bad about
yourself right now.

33:46.168 --> 33:48.252
And I also know
how just one kiss

33:48.286 --> 33:50.221
can get you into
a whole lot of trouble.

33:50.255 --> 33:51.556
Believe me.

33:51.590 --> 33:55.259
But if Mr. Shue doesn't want you
around anymore, forget him.

33:55.293 --> 33:57.428
Don't let him define you.

33:57.462 --> 33:59.814
Problem is, he does define me.

33:59.848 --> 34:03.267
The four years I spent
in this Glee Club

34:03.301 --> 34:04.936
defines me.

34:04.970 --> 34:06.738
This whole freakin' school
defines me,

34:06.772 --> 34:08.156
and without it, I am...

34:08.190 --> 34:10.440
I just feel... lost.

34:10.475 --> 34:11.492
So...

34:11.527 --> 34:13.761
After we lost Sectionals, I was

34:13.795 --> 34:15.079
terrified

34:15.114 --> 34:16.898
that everything was
just going to fall apart,

34:16.931 --> 34:18.315
but you fought

34:18.333 --> 34:20.001
to keep us together.

34:20.034 --> 34:21.452
You're a natural leader, Finn.

34:21.485 --> 34:23.788
A teacher.

34:23.822 --> 34:26.090
You don't need
Mr. Shue's approval to be that.

34:26.125 --> 34:27.091
Yeah,

34:27.126 --> 34:28.159
but I do need a little thing

34:28.193 --> 34:29.159
called a teaching degree.

34:29.178 --> 34:30.962
So...

34:31.964 --> 34:33.496
...go get one.

34:43.766 --> 34:45.768
(school bell ringing)

34:47.071 --> 34:48.487
(sighs)

34:48.522 --> 34:49.972
You gonna challenge
all three of us to a feud now?

34:49.989 --> 34:52.108
Look, I asked you guys here
for a truce.

34:53.494 --> 34:54.476
Okay, sometimes

34:54.495 --> 34:55.862
I don't know how to fit in here.

34:57.047 --> 34:58.981
But kissing you, Marley...

34:58.999 --> 35:00.650
that was so out of line,
and I'm sorry.

35:00.684 --> 35:01.984
It's okay.

35:02.002 --> 35:04.954
It's not, but...
I'll never do it again.

35:06.924 --> 35:09.208
Look, friendship is about trust.

35:09.259 --> 35:10.993
Okay? It's like
when we're playing football.

35:11.011 --> 35:13.346
Look, I fumbled
the ball this time,

35:13.380 --> 35:15.548
but you know I have good hands.

35:15.599 --> 35:16.683
I just made a mistake.

35:16.717 --> 35:18.017
You know

35:18.052 --> 35:19.385
if you give me the ball again,

35:19.436 --> 35:20.553
I won't let you down.

35:25.275 --> 35:27.343
Yeah, but it might take
a little while.

35:27.361 --> 35:28.344
I take that.

35:28.362 --> 35:29.729
Thank you.

35:29.780 --> 35:30.730
(sighs)

35:30.781 --> 35:32.365
Unique...

35:32.399 --> 35:34.683
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
like I understand everything

35:34.702 --> 35:35.785
that's going on with you.

35:35.819 --> 35:37.236
(sighs)

35:37.271 --> 35:39.021
But you have a truth,

35:39.039 --> 35:40.356
and as your friend,

35:40.391 --> 35:41.941
I need to support
that truth, so...

35:41.975 --> 35:43.493
you're a girl, dude.

35:44.945 --> 35:47.063
Holy crap, did I mess that up?

35:47.097 --> 35:48.130
No, it's just...

35:49.516 --> 35:51.434
That day, after we sang...

35:51.468 --> 35:54.771
I decided to walk home
in all my Leslie Uggams glory,

35:54.805 --> 35:57.824
<i>and a group of popular girls</i>
<i>came after me.</i>

35:57.858 --> 35:58.941
GIRL 1: ...serious?
Look at this.

35:58.975 --> 36:00.993
Are you a boy or a girl?

36:01.028 --> 36:03.279
Hey! Freak!

36:03.313 --> 36:05.147
Lady Freak!

36:05.165 --> 36:06.949
I got home before
they caught up to me,

36:06.983 --> 36:08.985
but I was so scared.

36:09.019 --> 36:10.653
I'm walking you home
from now on.

36:10.671 --> 36:11.671
Yeah. Me, too.

36:11.705 --> 36:13.339
Me, three. KITTY: Me, four.

36:13.373 --> 36:15.324
And P.S., do those bitches
go to this school?

36:15.342 --> 36:16.826
'Cause if so,
I want their names

36:16.844 --> 36:18.327
so I can put Nair
in their shampoo bottles.

36:18.345 --> 36:20.329
Wait a minute. We're friends?
Look,

36:20.347 --> 36:22.014
I don't know if it's 'cause
I've been dating Puckerman,

36:22.049 --> 36:24.434
which makes it really hard
to judge anyone...

36:24.468 --> 36:26.753
and I will deny it
outside in the real world...

36:26.787 --> 36:28.087
but, yes.

36:28.122 --> 36:29.088
We're friends.

36:29.123 --> 36:30.423
And we're in this together.

36:30.457 --> 36:31.507
I'm a winner,

36:31.542 --> 36:32.642
and I want to win Regionals.

36:32.676 --> 36:34.009
So we need to cut the crap

36:34.027 --> 36:35.111
and the fighting

36:35.145 --> 36:36.512
and tighten up
so we can win this.

36:36.530 --> 36:39.031
Friendships are tested
like this all the time.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.366
And the ones that are real

36:40.400 --> 36:41.868
are the ones
that pass the test.

36:41.902 --> 36:43.786
Artie and Tina and Sam
and probably Brittany

36:43.821 --> 36:45.455
are all going to be gone
next year,

36:45.489 --> 36:46.773
and it's going to be up to us

36:46.807 --> 36:48.441
to keep up the Glee Club torch.

36:48.475 --> 36:50.710
Not just winning
competitions, but...

36:50.744 --> 36:53.796
the legacy of being
the only place at this school...

36:53.831 --> 36:55.465
at any school...

36:55.499 --> 36:56.999
where the most special thing
you can be is yourself.

36:57.033 --> 36:58.801
Think we're up for it?

36:58.836 --> 36:59.869
Are you kidding?

36:59.887 --> 37:01.838
This place ain't seen
nothing yet.

37:01.872 --> 37:03.306
Yeah!
Oh, yeah...

37:03.340 --> 37:06.041
(laughing)

37:06.059 --> 37:08.060
(school bell ringing)

37:08.095 --> 37:11.013
SUE:
You look absolutely

37:11.047 --> 37:12.047
adorable.

37:12.065 --> 37:13.349
And just to show there's

37:13.383 --> 37:14.684
no animosity between us,

37:14.718 --> 37:16.051
I've decided to make
you and Becky

37:16.069 --> 37:17.987
my Cheerios!
Co-captains.

37:18.021 --> 37:19.405
Yes!

37:20.407 --> 37:22.057
I love you.

37:22.075 --> 37:23.359
Thank you.
(Sue whistles)

37:23.393 --> 37:25.912
Let this be a life
lesson to you...

37:25.946 --> 37:28.397
one that you'll remember
20 years from now,

37:28.415 --> 37:29.899
when you're playing
"Uncle Nubbins"

37:29.933 --> 37:32.001
on <i>The Suite Life of</i>
<i>Zack and Cody</i> reboot...

37:32.035 --> 37:34.337
that the real world is nothing
like the Glee Club,

37:34.371 --> 37:36.405
where you can join and rejoin,

37:36.423 --> 37:38.007
quit and requit

37:38.041 --> 37:39.675
whenever you're not crying

37:39.710 --> 37:41.377
or throwing confetti
at each other.

37:41.411 --> 37:43.830
Because in the real world,
there are commitments...

37:43.864 --> 37:46.065
and you're only as good
as your word.

37:50.053 --> 37:51.938
Blaine Devon Anderson,

37:51.972 --> 37:54.557
do I have your word
that you are

37:54.591 --> 37:56.692
fully committed to my team?

37:56.727 --> 37:57.894
What? She can't hear you!

37:57.928 --> 38:00.112
Yes, Coach Sylvester.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.565
All right.

38:02.599 --> 38:04.433
Gymnasium, 3:05.

38:04.451 --> 38:06.769
Oh, a little trick
of the trade...

38:06.787 --> 38:08.571
from now on, wear a thong

38:08.605 --> 38:10.656
to avoid visible panty lines.

38:12.993 --> 38:14.961
(sighs)

38:29.476 --> 38:30.643
How'd it go?

38:30.677 --> 38:31.928
Exactly as planned.

38:31.962 --> 38:33.062
I'm gonna work from the inside

38:33.096 --> 38:34.597
and bring her down.

38:34.631 --> 38:35.731
By the time we graduate,

38:35.766 --> 38:36.933
Sue Sylvester's reign of terror

38:36.967 --> 38:38.100
will finally be over.

38:38.135 --> 38:40.019
Excellent!

38:54.001 --> 38:56.035
Good evening, Vicky.

39:00.007 --> 39:01.357
Santana. How did you...

39:01.391 --> 39:02.992
I told you.
This is what I do.

39:03.010 --> 39:04.293
You can't tell Rachel.

39:04.327 --> 39:06.345
Please, I'm not proud of this.

39:06.380 --> 39:07.496
Save it.

39:07.514 --> 39:08.864
I think there's someone
more important

39:08.899 --> 39:10.016
that you should convince
tonight.

39:15.672 --> 39:16.772
Okay.

39:16.807 --> 39:19.025
Well, I am going
to leave you two alone

39:19.059 --> 39:20.443
for a little girl talk.

39:20.477 --> 39:21.477
Have fun.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.727
Listen, I can explain this.
Shut your mouth.

39:31.761 --> 39:33.228
After tonight...

39:33.263 --> 39:34.713
you're a ghost.

39:34.731 --> 39:37.215
You disappear
from her life forever.

39:37.233 --> 39:39.017
No good-byes, nothing.

39:39.051 --> 39:40.319
I love her.

39:43.740 --> 39:45.908
But she doesn't really even know
who you are.

39:47.443 --> 39:48.443
Yet.

39:50.747 --> 39:51.947
You can't tell her.
