00:05.798 --> 00:07.914
JENNIFER: lwant
to tell you a story.

00:11.053 --> 00:13.385
About how the world ends.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.558
And the man from the future
sent back through time

00:20.146 --> 00:21.511
to stop it.

00:22.732 --> 00:26.020
Here, in the present day,
he uncovered a conspiracy.

00:27.570 --> 00:31.563
Men in the shadows
who sought to release
a plague upon the world.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.481
They call themselves

00:33.659 --> 00:36.446
the Army of
the Twelve Monkeys.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.239
But in the darkness,
the man found hope.

00:42.168 --> 00:43.374
A woman.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.125
A partner.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.703
Together, they fought
to stop the plague.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.881
But fate was
not on their side.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.878
For you see, the man also
forged a bond with another,

00:56.307 --> 00:58.639
someone he
considered a brother.

00:58.851 --> 01:02.014
If the man were to succeed
and change the future,

01:02.939 --> 01:05.555
the brother’s son
would never be born.

01:07.526 --> 01:11.439
So the brother turned
his back on the man
andjoined the enemy.

01:11.781 --> 01:12.770
(GUNSHOTS)

01:12.865 --> 01:15.948
The woman was wounded,
dying in her time.

01:17.203 --> 01:20.616
So to save her,
the man sent her to his.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.156
And in the end,
because the woman
had taught him to love,

01:25.461 --> 01:28.077
the man could not
let his brother die.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.797
Even though it was written.

01:32.009 --> 01:36.127
The man broke that
fate and changed time.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.594
Now, the time of
the plague is upon us.

01:41.727 --> 01:45.185
And the man and woman
are separated by
oceans oftime.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.731
Destined to never
see one another again.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.064
I told you, this is the story

01:52.154 --> 01:53.485
of how the world ends.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.189
One that begins at the end,

01:56.284 --> 01:58.275
and ends at the beginning.

01:59.495 --> 02:03.864
A story that, like time
itself, can be changed.

Hello, Traveler.

03:36.842 --> 03:39.094
You almost
had me in Shanghai.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.298

03:42.431 --> 03:44.092
You cannot run from fate.

03:44.517 --> 03:47.099

you kept poking
your head above ground.

(BEEPING)

03:51.273 --> 03:52.433
RAMSE: Let me ask you,

03:53.150 --> 03:56.358
why is the Army of
the Twelve Monkeys
trying to kill me?

03:56.445 --> 03:58.777
Because your
death is preordained.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.604
You served your purpose.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.200
And now,
the plague is imminent.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.950
It was your guidance
that led us to the virus.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.698
And for this,
we're grateful.

04:07.123 --> 04:09.455
But now
your cycle is complete.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.203
So long, Traveler.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.706

That was cutting it close.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.432
What are you talking about?
Timing was perfect.

04:36.527 --> 04:37.983
They already had
their guns drawn.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.810
Relax, you're alive.

04:46.245 --> 04:49.237

are once again
unified in purpose.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.325
Nah.
Not really.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.157
We just don't
like you.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.664
How we all feel about
each other is irrelevant
in this moment,

04:55.754 --> 04:58.996
because neither you
nor your friend
will leave this bridge alive.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.212
You're outnumbered.

Don't do that!

06:25.469 --> 06:27.084
There's no sign of 'em.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.420
None of this
was foreseen.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.218
We need to
protect the virus.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.392
Jennifer's taking too long.
I want you to shadow her.
Personally.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.889
That is not the will
of the Witness.

06:36.981 --> 06:38.141

old man?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.006

At least you got
a close of Jones'

that's going be,
like, a running theme?

07:21.150 --> 07:22.481
lthink so.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.941
I like it.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.022
I'm low on ammo.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.733

ifyour friends
show up again.

my friends.

make it much better.

You know they're
never gonna stop, right?

07:36.206 --> 07:38.197
Witness knows
the future.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.700
He's always gonna
be a step ahead.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.626
You wanna be
running your whole life?

07:42.713 --> 07:44.624
It's not about running.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.497
Cassie's gone.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.545
Maybe she made it to

to stop the virus.

my son.

Why don't you
stop me, then, huh?

Can't keep underground
forever.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.756
It's like she said,

08:30.219 --> 08:32.505
the minute we
poke our head up,

08:32.763 --> 08:34.594
they're gonna find us.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.393
They never found us in Berlin.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.356
We were in the tunnels
the whole time there.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.354
We were underground.

might be able to
tell the future,

they're finding us.

08:56.787 --> 08:59.244
They must've put
a tracker in me.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.539
We gotta find someone
who can find it
and cut it out.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.537

back-alley surgeon.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.960

across the Danube.

Worked with him at Markridge.

09:10.134 --> 09:12.716

You stay here underground.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.339

has always been...

quite difficult for you,

It wasn't.

You're gonna keep on trying.
And you're gonna
get yourself killed.

So, you know, I got a boat.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.394
Okay. But I'm
doing all the talking.

31:39.482 --> 31:42.690
Why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

31:42.985 --> 31:46.978
What, uh, brings you
to the world of speed dating?

But I'm probably
just gonna go find
somebody else to talk to.

32:29.323 --> 32:31.359
But no...
I got cases of this stuff.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.611
And, quite frankly,
I mean, if I'm being frank,

32:33.702 --> 32:34.953
far too many reasons
to use it.
