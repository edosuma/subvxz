CHORUS:
* Going barefoot
in the park

00:44.561 --> 00:47.564
* Where it says,
"Keep off the grass"

00:48.599 --> 00:52.836
* Isn't recommended
for the very old

00:56.840 --> 01:00.811
* But when you're young
and you're in love

01:00.844 --> 01:03.547
* The world is beautiful

01:05.015 --> 01:08.985
* And I'm not a bit afraid
of you catching cold

01:12.689 --> 01:15.392
* Running barefoot
through the park

01:16.560 --> 01:19.396
* Searching bareheaded
in the rain

01:20.431 --> 01:23.133
* For a midwinter daisy

01:23.166 --> 01:25.636
* Seems kind of crazy to do

01:28.271 --> 01:31.274

My barefoot love

* To the fields
that shine with spring

in daisies with you

This is the Plaza Hotel, please.

02:31.301 --> 02:33.136
Plaza. Corie, it's the Plaza.

02:33.169 --> 02:35.005
Wait a minute.
I'm not finished.

02:36.106 --> 02:37.508
Corie, the man is waiting. Wait.

02:37.541 --> 02:39.275
Give him a big tip.

02:39.309 --> 02:41.978
Paul, tell me
you're not sorry
we got married.

02:42.012 --> 02:44.023
After 40 minutes?
Let's give it a couple
of hours first.

02:44.047 --> 02:45.749

doesn't work out,
let's not get divorced.

Let's kill each other.

And is Mrs. Bratter
staying with you?

Six days.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.957

04:00.991 --> 04:02.693
It's a pleasure
to have you

04:22.077 --> 04:23.647

04:27.383 --> 04:28.585
This way, please.

Oh, ex...excuse me.
Excuse us, please.

I'm only 15 years old.

what life is going
to be like

04:41.464 --> 04:43.634
for the next 50 years?

04:43.667 --> 04:46.002
Is that all we're going
to be married, 50 years?

04:46.036 --> 04:47.137
That's not very long.

04:47.170 --> 04:50.140
No, wait. Don't make
rash judgments.

04:50.173 --> 04:52.509
Paul, I think
I'm going to be
a lousy wife.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.310
But don't be angry with me.

04:54.344 --> 04:56.346
I love you very much,

04:56.379 --> 04:58.181
and I'm very sexy.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.482
Then let's go inside.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.952
I'm paying $30 a day.

05:01.985 --> 05:04.220
Okay, Paul, let's
start the marriage.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.189
Good luck, Paul.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.559
Good luck, Corie.

05:34.985 --> 05:36.587
Forget it.
They're never
coming out.

05:36.620 --> 05:37.487
How long has it been now?

05:37.520 --> 05:38.889
Five days.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.891
(WHISTLES) That must be
a hotel record.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.525
For a political convention.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.628
A honeymoon record is nine days.

Wait a minute, Paul!
Where are you going?

05:58.575 --> 06:00.510
Work. I have to go to work.

06:00.543 --> 06:01.954
I don't do this
for a living,
you know.

06:01.978 --> 06:03.756
Can't you call them
and tell them you can't
come in today?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.048
Tell them you're sick.

06:05.081 --> 06:06.583
I am sick,
but I have
to go in today.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.327
Last night you promised
you'd never leave me.

06:08.351 --> 06:11.187
But it's just
till 5:30.
Just until 5:30.

06:11.221 --> 06:14.157
Corie, if it's
a good marriage,
it'll last until 5:30.

06:15.391 --> 06:16.893
See you.
Tonight, hey?

06:20.063 --> 06:21.397
What was that?

06:21.431 --> 06:22.565
A kiss?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.680
Dear, would you
get inside?
This is a nice hotel.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.371
Was that a kiss?

'Cause, boy, if that's what
kisses are going to be like
from now on,

06:30.506 --> 06:32.442
don't bother
to come back at 5:30.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.310
Corie, I can't kiss you anymore.

06:34.344 --> 06:36.625
My lips are numb.
Now will you
(WHISPERS) please go inside?

If you don't give me
a real kiss,

give you back

17:55.858 --> 17:58.461
He won't notice
the place is empty
till June.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.864
So long,
Gramercy 59971.
Have a nice marriage.

18:01.897 --> 18:03.132
Oh. Thank you.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.468
And may you soon
have many extensions.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.239
Frank, he's on his way up.

18:10.272 --> 18:12.007
Can you hang on
for five more flights?

18:12.842 --> 18:13.842
Paul?

18:14.844 --> 18:16.379
Hurry up, darling!

18:18.247 --> 18:20.516
Now, don't expect too much,

18:21.617 --> 18:24.887
'cause the furniture
hasn't gotten here yet!

18:24.920 --> 18:28.023
And, Paul, the paint
didn't turn out exactly right,

18:29.459 --> 18:31.794
but I think it's
going to be beautiful!

18:34.864 --> 18:35.864
Paul?

18:37.166 --> 18:39.335
Paul, are you all right?

18:39.369 --> 18:41.003
(PANTING) I'm coming.
I'm coming.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.372
What?

18:42.405 --> 18:44.039
He's coming.
He's coming.

18:50.012 --> 18:51.714
He's coming.
He's coming.

19:08.163 --> 19:09.465
(GRUNTS)

19:10.833 --> 19:12.101
Hi, sweetheart!

19:12.134 --> 19:13.403
(PANTING)

19:14.003 --> 19:15.003
Oh, darling!

19:16.739 --> 19:18.340
(GASPING)
(MOANS)

19:20.543 --> 19:22.545
Oh! Say something.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.848
(GASPING) It's six...
It's six flights.
Did you...

19:28.884 --> 19:30.620
Did you know it's six flights?

19:30.653 --> 19:32.688
Well, it isn't.
It's only five.

19:33.322 --> 19:34.424
What about that big thing

19:34.457 --> 19:36.492
hanging outside the building?

19:36.526 --> 19:38.628
That's not a flight.
It's a stoop.

19:39.462 --> 19:41.163
It may look like a stoop.

19:41.196 --> 19:42.832
But it climbs like a flight.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.902
Is that all you have to say?

19:46.936 --> 19:48.904
I didn't think
I'd get that much out.

19:48.938 --> 19:49.938
Oh.

19:52.174 --> 19:53.643
But it didn't...

19:54.777 --> 19:56.546
It didn't seem like six flights

19:56.579 --> 19:57.480
when I first saw the apartment.

19:57.513 --> 19:59.815
Why... Why is that?

19:59.849 --> 20:01.383
You didn't see
this apartment, Paul.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.453
Don't you remember?
The woman wasn't home.

20:03.486 --> 20:05.855
You... You saw
the apartment
on the third floor.

20:05.888 --> 20:07.022
Then that's why.

20:07.056 --> 20:08.524
You don't like it!
No, I...

20:08.558 --> 20:11.126
Boy, you really
don't like it!
I do like it, dear.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.838
I'm just waiting
for my eyes
to clear first.

20:12.862 --> 20:15.631
I... I thought you
were gonna come in here
and say, "Wow!"

20:15.665 --> 20:17.132
I will.

20:17.166 --> 20:18.634
I will.
I'm just...

20:19.769 --> 20:20.769
Yes.

20:35.184 --> 20:36.184
Wow.

20:37.352 --> 20:39.421
Paul, it's going
to be beautiful!

20:40.289 --> 20:41.691
I promise you!

20:44.460 --> 20:46.061
Do you know what?
What?

20:46.095 --> 20:48.397
I missed you.
Did you really?

20:48.430 --> 20:49.808
In the middle of the
Monday morning conference,

20:49.832 --> 20:51.967
I, you know...
I began to...

20:56.205 --> 20:57.673
Let's go back
to The Plaza.
What?

20:57.707 --> 20:59.441
Oh, we still
have an hour
till checkout time.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.976
We can't.
Why?

21:01.010 --> 21:03.713
We stole a towel
and three ashtrays.
We're hot.

21:16.158 --> 21:19.028
You know, for...
For a lawyer,
you're some good kisser.

21:20.329 --> 21:21.531
Hey!

21:22.297 --> 21:23.666
What?

21:23.699 --> 21:25.768
For a kisser,
I'm some good lawyer.

21:25.801 --> 21:27.603
Something's happened.
Mmm-hmm.

21:27.637 --> 21:30.405
Something has
happened, Paul!
Well, tell me what?

21:30.439 --> 21:32.942
It's not positive,
but the office is gonna
call and let me know.

21:32.975 --> 21:35.277
They called.
I mean, I called.

21:35.310 --> 21:36.612
When?
Now.

21:36.646 --> 21:38.781
Where? Where?
Over there.
Over there.

21:38.814 --> 21:40.425
Right over there.
They're on the phone,
right now.

21:40.449 --> 21:42.552
You didn't tell me, Corie.
I forgot.

21:42.585 --> 21:44.186
You kissed me
and got me all crazy.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.522
Frank. Yes, Frank. Tell...

21:49.925 --> 21:52.494
That's very funny, Frank.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.830
For a lawyer,
I'm some good kisser.

21:54.864 --> 21:56.808
Listen. Paul, I'd love
to listen for
the rest of the night,

21:56.832 --> 21:58.934
but I've got work to do,
and you do, too.

21:58.968 --> 22:00.448
You've a got a case
in court tomorrow.

22:02.137 --> 22:04.006
Frank, are you kidding?

22:04.039 --> 22:06.208
Do you mean this?
The whole thing?

22:06.776 --> 22:08.611
Birnbaum versus Gump.

22:08.644 --> 22:10.155
Marshall just came in
and dumped the whole case

22:10.179 --> 22:12.514
in our eager,
and inexperienced
little hands.

22:12.548 --> 22:16.051
This is it, Paul. This is
our chance to get the key
to the executive washroom.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.853
Well, we're a cinch.
Listen, Frank,

22:17.887 --> 22:20.289
I'll go over the briefs
here tonight.

22:20.322 --> 22:21.967
And I'll meet you
at the office, say,
8:00 in the morning.

22:21.991 --> 22:23.626
We'll go over
everything together.

22:23.659 --> 22:26.596
Yes... Frank, you
think I have time
to grow a mustache?

22:27.797 --> 22:31.200
Did you hear?
Did you hear?
It's my first case!

22:31.233 --> 22:32.602
I'm going to be a lawyer!

22:32.635 --> 22:34.236
That's great, Paul.

22:39.675 --> 22:40.819
You're going to have
to work tonight?

22:40.843 --> 22:42.353
Yeah. I'm going to go
over the affidavits.

22:42.377 --> 22:44.546
This furrier's suing
a woman for nonpayment
of bills.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.881
I've got the furrier.

22:45.915 --> 22:47.282
I have a black lace nightgown.

22:47.316 --> 22:48.994
It seems he made
these four specially
tailored coats

22:49.018 --> 22:50.886
for this woman on Park Avenue.

22:50.920 --> 22:53.122
Now she doesn't want the coats.

22:53.155 --> 22:55.891
She's only 4'8".
He'd have to sell them
to a rich midget.

22:55.925 --> 22:57.893
You know,
I thought I'd...
I'd put on a record

22:57.927 --> 23:00.062
and do an original
Cambodian fertility dance.

23:00.095 --> 23:01.396
It's...

23:01.430 --> 23:03.032
There's no signed contract.

23:03.065 --> 23:05.868
What's happening here?
What is this?
What are you doing?

23:05.901 --> 23:07.545
I'm trying to get you
all hot and bothered,

23:07.569 --> 23:09.805
and you're...summing up
for the jury!

23:10.973 --> 23:12.307
I mean,
the whole marriage
is over.

23:12.341 --> 23:14.009
Corie, honey, I'm sorry.

23:14.877 --> 23:16.712
I guess I'm excited, that's all.

23:16.746 --> 23:18.489
You want me to be
rich and famous,
now, don't you, really?

23:18.513 --> 23:19.982
During the day.

23:20.015 --> 23:21.416
At night I want you
here and sexy.

23:21.450 --> 23:23.819
Oh, I will.

23:23.853 --> 23:25.764
Look, I tell you what,
now tomorrow night,
your night.

23:25.788 --> 23:27.232
We'll do whatever
you like, all right?

23:27.256 --> 23:29.124
Something wild,
and crazy, and insane?

23:29.158 --> 23:30.592
Fine.
Like what?

23:31.293 --> 23:32.394
I... I'll come home early.

23:32.427 --> 23:33.929
We'll wallpaper each other.

23:33.963 --> 23:35.931
But tonight, dear,
I've got to work.

23:35.965 --> 23:37.166
Please, okay?

23:37.900 --> 23:39.334
Okay? Okay.
Okay.

23:40.435 --> 23:42.705
So where do I sit?

23:42.738 --> 23:44.582
Oh, the furniture
will be here
in a minute, Paul.

23:44.606 --> 23:45.784
They probably
got stuck
in the traffic.

23:45.808 --> 23:46.942
Fine, but what about tonight?

23:46.976 --> 23:48.978
I've got a case
in court in the morning.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.681
Maybe we ought to
check into a hotel.

23:51.714 --> 23:55.017
Paul, we just checked
out of a hotel! (SIGHS)

23:55.050 --> 23:56.561
I'm gonna sleep
in my own
apartment tonight.

23:56.585 --> 23:58.988
Where, dear, where?

23:59.021 --> 24:01.356
There's only room
for one in the bathtub.

24:08.263 --> 24:09.431
Where's the bathtub?

24:09.464 --> 24:11.633
There's no bathtub.
There's a shower.
No bathtub.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.068
How am I going to take a bath?

24:13.102 --> 24:14.646
You're not
gonna take a bath.
You'll take a shower.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.081
I don't like
showers, Corie.
I like baths.

24:16.105 --> 24:18.373
How am I gonna take a bath?

24:18.407 --> 24:21.176
You lie down in the shower
and hang your feet
over the sink.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.244
(SCOFFS)

24:24.146 --> 24:26.281
You know, it's freezing in here.

24:26.315 --> 24:27.917
Isn't there any heat? Hmm?

24:27.950 --> 24:30.019
Of course.
There's a radiator.

24:39.594 --> 24:42.531
That's... The radiator's
the coldest thing
in the room.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.099
Does the building
have a janitor?

24:44.133 --> 24:46.001
Only Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.

24:48.370 --> 24:51.106
Oh, Paul, it's going
to warm up a lot
when the furniture gets here.

24:51.140 --> 24:53.719
What about tonight, Corie?
I've got a case in court
in the morning.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.903
Well, stop saying it
like you have a case
every morning!

24:56.378 --> 24:57.980
This is your first one.

24:58.013 --> 24:59.214
Well, how...

25:04.586 --> 25:06.021
What are you doing?

25:06.055 --> 25:08.223
I'm trying to see
if these windows
are closed.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.225
They're closed
and bolted.
Why is it windy in here?

25:10.259 --> 25:11.560
I don't feel a draft.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.462
No, I didn't say draft,
I said wind.

25:13.495 --> 25:15.606
There's a brisk
northeasterly wind
blowing in this room.

25:15.630 --> 25:17.132
You don't have to get sarcastic.

25:17.166 --> 25:19.769
I'm not getting sarcastic.
I'm getting chapped lips.

25:19.802 --> 25:21.904
How can there be wind
in a closed room?
A-ha!

25:23.005 --> 25:24.173
How's this for an answer?

25:24.206 --> 25:25.908
There's a hole in the skylight.

25:28.443 --> 25:29.711
Oh, Paul.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.182
Paul, don't get excited.

25:33.215 --> 25:35.017
Listen, we'll plug
it up for tonight.

25:35.050 --> 25:37.652
How? How?
That's 20 feet high!

25:37.686 --> 25:40.122
I should have to fly
over in a plane
and drop something in.

25:40.155 --> 25:42.035
It's only for one night.
And it's not that cold.

25:42.591 --> 25:44.126
In February?

25:44.159 --> 25:45.804
Do you know what
it's like in February
at 3:00 in the morning?

25:45.828 --> 25:47.662
It's ice-cold freezing.

25:47.696 --> 25:49.407
It's not going
to be freezing.
I called the weather bureau.

25:49.431 --> 25:51.801
It's going to be cloudy
with a light snow...

25:57.406 --> 25:58.673
What? What? What?

25:58.707 --> 26:00.109
Light what?
Snow.

26:01.176 --> 26:02.176
Snow?

26:03.045 --> 26:05.080
It's going to snow
tonight? Hmm?

26:05.547 --> 26:07.082
In here?

26:07.116 --> 26:08.894
They're wrong as often
as they're right.
Right. (CHUCKLES)

26:08.918 --> 26:12.054
I see, I'm going to be
shoveling snow
in my own living room.

26:12.087 --> 26:15.390
Well, in the first place,
Paul, it's just a little hole.

26:15.424 --> 26:17.102
And in the second place,
what do you want me to do?

26:17.126 --> 26:18.994
Go to pieces!
Like me.

26:19.761 --> 26:21.163
It's natural.

26:21.196 --> 26:22.397
Paul.
Hmm?

26:23.532 --> 26:25.134
I have a better idea.

26:30.039 --> 26:32.607
I'm going to keep you warm.
Hmm?

26:32.641 --> 26:34.376
And there's no charge
for electricity.

26:34.409 --> 26:35.409
All right.

26:41.316 --> 26:42.852
Corie, I can't do this.

26:52.995 --> 26:54.596
Do you think Corie'd be upset

26:54.629 --> 26:56.598
if I just popped up
and said hello?

26:56.631 --> 26:58.433
Upset with her own mother? Why?

26:59.068 --> 27:00.735
I do it all the time.

27:00.769 --> 27:02.247
But the children
are hardly set up yet.

27:02.271 --> 27:04.273
They're still practically
on their honeymoon.

27:04.306 --> 27:07.309
Oh, she's probably
dying for your advice.
You know young brides.

27:07.342 --> 27:09.544
Not Corie.
She gives her own advice.

27:10.779 --> 27:12.381
All right, let's go home.

27:12.414 --> 27:14.183
I'll just be 10 minutes.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.018
Uh, no longer.
I'll be circling
the block.

27:26.461 --> 27:29.598
I can see I haven't
got much of a law career
ahead of me.

27:29.631 --> 27:31.600
Good. I hope we starve.

27:32.935 --> 27:35.470
I hope they find us dead
in each other's arms.

27:35.504 --> 27:38.173
"Frozen skinny lovers
found on 10th Street."

27:45.080 --> 27:46.581
Then we are in love again?

27:46.615 --> 27:47.615
Yes, we're in love again.

27:50.719 --> 27:52.187
(DOORBELL RINGS)

27:52.787 --> 27:54.223
It's the bed.

27:55.390 --> 27:56.892
(WHISPERS)
It's the bed.
Yes.

28:02.064 --> 28:03.198
I hope it's the bed.

28:04.967 --> 28:06.068
Bloomingdale's?

28:06.801 --> 28:08.904
Surprise!

28:08.938 --> 28:10.705
Oh, no.
She couldn't wait.
What?

28:10.739 --> 28:12.841
Your mother?
I invited her
for Tuesday.

28:12.874 --> 28:14.252
Corie, I can't entertain
your mother now.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.836
I've got a case
in court in the morning.

28:21.850 --> 28:23.552
She's gonna hate it.

28:23.585 --> 28:26.488
She's going to think
we're gypsies
living in an empty store.

28:26.521 --> 28:28.866
I don't get you, Corie.
Five minutes ago,
this place was paradise.

28:28.890 --> 28:31.126
Now suddenly, it's Cannery Row.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.827
She doesn't understand, Paul.

28:32.861 --> 28:34.229
She has a different
set of values.

28:34.263 --> 28:36.265
She's practical,
not young like us.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.333
Well, I'm 26 and cold as hell.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.235
(PANTING)

28:41.436 --> 28:42.537
(CLANGING)

28:49.644 --> 28:50.946
Oh, sorry.

28:57.586 --> 28:59.754
Paul. I want you
to promise me one thing.
What?

28:59.788 --> 29:01.623
Don't tell her
about the rent.
All right.

29:01.656 --> 29:03.725
If she asks you, tell her
you're not sure yet.

29:03.758 --> 29:05.227
"Not sure yet"?

29:05.260 --> 29:07.596
I have to know
what my rent is.
I'm a college graduate.

29:07.629 --> 29:09.198
Can't you lie a little for me?

29:09.231 --> 29:11.266
I mean,
you don't have
to tell her it's $125.

29:11.300 --> 29:13.002
Well, all right.
How much is it, then?

29:13.035 --> 29:14.436
$60.
(STUTTERS)

29:14.469 --> 29:16.038
$65.
What?

29:16.071 --> 29:18.073
$75, all right?

29:18.107 --> 29:20.375
$75.63 a month.
All right, Corie.

29:20.409 --> 29:22.377
Including gas
and electricity.
Yes.

29:22.411 --> 29:23.678
Paul, will she believe that?

29:23.712 --> 29:25.114
Anybody would believe that.

29:25.147 --> 29:26.848
It's the $125
that's hard to swallow.

29:26.881 --> 29:28.283
(PHONE RINGS)

29:32.554 --> 29:33.688
Yes? Hello.

29:34.656 --> 29:35.991
Yes, it is.

29:37.392 --> 29:38.460
You what?

29:39.861 --> 29:41.830
Thank you.
Thank you very much
for calling.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.265
That's fine.
That's just great.

29:43.298 --> 29:44.933
The furniture's not
coming till tomorrow.

29:44.966 --> 29:47.145
But they're sending up
a mattress and
some blankets for tonight.

29:47.169 --> 29:49.038
Won't that be cozy?
It'll be
all right, Paul.

29:49.071 --> 29:50.972
Just please
promise me one thing,

29:51.006 --> 29:52.517
don't let her
stay here too long
because I've got...

29:52.541 --> 29:55.177
A case in court
in the morning.
I know.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.046
(PANTING)
Hello, Mother.

29:57.846 --> 30:00.215
Hello, Mom.
I can't breathe.

30:00.249 --> 30:02.417
Take it easy, Mother.
I can't catch
my breath.

30:02.451 --> 30:03.918
You should have rested, Mom.

30:03.952 --> 30:06.555
I did, but there were
always more stairs.

30:06.588 --> 30:07.856
Oh, Paul, help her.

30:07.889 --> 30:08.990
Here, watch this step.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.459
Oh, more stairs?

30:13.562 --> 30:15.073
Mother, would you
like a glass of water?

30:15.097 --> 30:17.866
No, thank you, dear.
I can't swallow yet.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.468
Here, sit down, Mom.
Oh, my!

30:22.637 --> 30:24.173
It's not that high, Mother.

30:24.206 --> 30:26.475
I know dear,
it's not bad, really.

30:26.508 --> 30:28.643
What is it, nine flights?

30:28.677 --> 30:30.279
It's five.
We don't count
the front stoop.

30:30.312 --> 30:32.447
I didn't think I'd make it.

30:32.481 --> 30:33.924
If I had known
the people
on the third floor,

30:33.948 --> 30:35.717
I'd have gone to visit them.

30:37.052 --> 30:39.588
Oh, gee, Mother,
what a pleasant surprise.

30:39.621 --> 30:41.290
I'm not staying.

30:41.323 --> 30:43.592
Aunt Harriet's honking
the horn for me
in 10 minutes.

30:43.625 --> 30:46.661
Just one good look
around, that's all.

30:46.695 --> 30:49.131
I'm not sure I'm coming back.

30:49.164 --> 30:51.266
You can't tell anything yet.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.502
I... I wish
you'd arrived after
the furniture had come.

30:53.535 --> 30:56.238
Don't worry. I have
a marvelous imagination.

31:01.543 --> 31:02.543
Hmm.

31:03.912 --> 31:05.046
Well?

31:06.981 --> 31:08.517
Corie, baby, it's beautiful.

31:08.883 --> 31:09.883
You hate it.

31:10.685 --> 31:13.622
No, no, I love it.
It's a charming
apartment.

31:14.389 --> 31:15.957
I love it.

31:15.990 --> 31:18.369
Oh, it's not your kind
of apartment. I knew
you wouldn't like it!

31:18.393 --> 31:19.894
I love it!

31:19.928 --> 31:21.796
Paul, didn't I say I loved it?

31:21.830 --> 31:23.998
She said
she loved it.
I knew I said it.

31:24.032 --> 31:25.334
Oh, do you really, Mother?

31:25.367 --> 31:27.836
I mean, are...
Are you absolutely crazy
in love with it?

31:27.869 --> 31:30.071
Yes. It's very cute.

31:30.105 --> 31:32.341
And there's so much
you can do with it.

31:32.374 --> 31:34.343
I told you she hated it.

31:34.376 --> 31:36.411
Corie, you don't give
a person a chance.
(SIGHS)

31:36.445 --> 31:38.513
At least let me see
the whole apartment.

31:38.547 --> 31:39.748
This is the whole apartment.

31:39.781 --> 31:40.982
It's a nice, large room.

31:41.015 --> 31:42.784
There's a bedroom!
Where?

31:42.817 --> 31:44.319
One flight up.

31:44.353 --> 31:47.856
It's just two little steps.
See, one, two...three.

31:47.889 --> 31:49.424
Oh, split level.

31:51.260 --> 31:53.995
Where's the bedroom?
Through here?

31:54.028 --> 31:56.898
No, in here.
This is the bedroom.

31:56.931 --> 31:58.209
No, it's really
just a dressing room,

31:58.233 --> 31:59.577
but I'm going to use it
as a bedroom.

31:59.601 --> 32:01.069
Oh, that's a wonderful idea.

32:01.102 --> 32:02.937
And you can just
put a bed in here.

32:02.971 --> 32:05.140
That's right.
How?

32:05.174 --> 32:06.617
Oh, it'll fit. I...
I measured the room.

32:06.641 --> 32:08.377
A double bed?

32:08.410 --> 32:10.912
No, a large single.
Oh. Very nice.

32:10.945 --> 32:12.614
Where will Paul sleep?

32:13.248 --> 32:14.849
With me.
Large single?

32:16.185 --> 32:18.119
But you won't be able
to get to the closet.

32:18.153 --> 32:19.454
Yes, you will.

32:19.488 --> 32:21.523
Without climbing over the bed?

32:21.556 --> 32:22.933
Well, you have
to climb over the bed.

32:22.957 --> 32:24.826
Oh! That's a good idea.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.797
And you can just
hang your clothes
from the pipe.

32:28.830 --> 32:30.232
That's right.

32:32.401 --> 32:34.803
I mean, everything
is just temporary, Mother.

32:34.836 --> 32:36.347
What is it they say
in Harper's Bazaar?

32:36.371 --> 32:37.806
"It won't take shape

32:37.839 --> 32:40.909
"until the bride's
own personality
becomes clearly defined."

32:40.942 --> 32:43.345
I don't know.
I think it's you
right now.

32:44.513 --> 32:45.780
What's in here?

32:47.982 --> 32:49.684
Oh, the bathroom.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.422
No bathtub.

32:54.789 --> 32:56.358
This is the kitchen!

32:57.125 --> 32:58.493
It's very cozy.

32:59.794 --> 33:02.597
It's chilly in here.
Do you feel a draft?

33:02.631 --> 33:04.466
Here, stand
over here, Mom.
It's warmer.

33:04.499 --> 33:06.235
Mother, what
you need is a drink.

33:06.268 --> 33:08.179
Hey, Paul, would you
run down and get
a bottle of scotch?

33:08.203 --> 33:09.538
Now?
Yeah.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.341
Well, you certainly have
lots of wall space.

33:12.374 --> 33:13.814
What color are you
going to paint it?

33:13.975 --> 33:14.975
It's painted.

33:15.877 --> 33:17.379
Very attractive.

33:18.780 --> 33:19.780
Oh.

33:20.849 --> 33:22.551
I've got to go.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.553
No, Mother.
Not until you
have a drink.

33:24.586 --> 33:25.596
Paul, aren't you going
to get the scotch?

33:25.620 --> 33:27.222
I'll stay for just one drink.

33:27.256 --> 33:28.490
Sure. And I'll get the Scotch.

33:28.523 --> 33:30.301
Button up, dear.
It's cold.
Yes, I've noticed that.

33:30.325 --> 33:31.660
Get some cheese.
Cheese?

33:31.693 --> 33:32.693
Paul!

33:35.163 --> 33:36.698
I just want to give
my fella a kiss

33:36.731 --> 33:38.199
and wish him luck.
Thanks, Mom.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.535
Your new home is beautiful.
Yes.

33:40.569 --> 33:42.671
It's a perfect
little apartment.
It is, thank you.

33:42.704 --> 33:44.072
Then you do like it?

33:44.105 --> 33:45.440
Like it? Why?

33:45.474 --> 33:46.684
Where else
can you get
anything like this

33:46.708 --> 33:48.477
for 75.63 a month?

33:48.510 --> 33:50.078
Are you sure, Paul?

33:50.111 --> 33:51.913
Six flights of stairs again.

33:53.181 --> 33:54.783
It's the only way to travel.

33:58.152 --> 33:59.521
Well...

33:59.554 --> 34:02.324
Corie, baby,
I'm so excited for you.

34:02.357 --> 34:03.592
Mmm-hmm.
(SIGHS)

34:05.827 --> 34:07.438
Mother, it's not
exactly the way
you pictured, is it?

34:07.462 --> 34:09.764
Well, it's unusual.

34:10.699 --> 34:12.801
Like you.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.335
I remember
when you were
a little girl,

34:14.369 --> 34:17.205
you said you wanted
to live on the moon.

34:17.237 --> 34:18.973
I thought you were joking.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.275
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:25.914 --> 34:27.716
Well, drunk again, huh?

34:28.650 --> 34:30.585
Okay, I'll take care of him.

34:39.793 --> 34:41.862
I know what let's do.
(CLEARS THROAT)

34:41.896 --> 34:43.797
Let's open my presents
and see what you sent me.

34:43.831 --> 34:44.933
(SIGHS)

34:48.670 --> 34:50.103
Hey.

34:50.138 --> 34:52.873
What's in here?
That sounds expensive.

34:52.907 --> 34:54.943
Now I think it's a broken clock.

35:03.117 --> 35:04.486
Ah!

35:04.519 --> 35:06.755
Aunt Harriet
helped me pick it out.

35:08.557 --> 35:11.159
She thinks I should move
into New York City now.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.127
Hey, that's an idea.

35:13.161 --> 35:15.296
I said, "Why, Harriet?
Just because I'm alone?"

35:15.330 --> 35:18.633
I said, "I'm not
afraid to live alone."

35:18.667 --> 35:21.536
"In some ways, it's better
to live alone," I said.

35:23.805 --> 35:25.306
Does this pot
come with directions?

35:25.340 --> 35:26.708
If I had known
about this kitchen,

35:26.741 --> 35:28.101
it would have come
with hot coffee.

35:30.612 --> 35:33.348
Mother. Oh, I love everything.

35:35.950 --> 35:39.020
You've got to stop
sending me presents.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.965
You know, you should
start spending
your money on yourself.

35:40.989 --> 35:42.457
Well, myself?

35:43.858 --> 35:45.536
What does a woman
like me need,
living all alone,

35:45.560 --> 35:47.462
way out in New Jersey?

35:47.496 --> 35:48.730
You could travel.

35:48.763 --> 35:49.864
Oh, travel.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.068
Alone? At my age?

35:56.270 --> 35:58.206
I read a story in The Times.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.108
A middle-aged woman
traveling alone,

36:00.141 --> 36:02.677
fell off the deck of a ship.

36:02.711 --> 36:05.580
They never discovered it
till they got to France.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.218
Mother...

36:10.251 --> 36:12.363
I promise you,
if you ever fell off
the deck of a ship,

36:12.387 --> 36:14.423
somebody would know about it.

36:15.824 --> 36:17.424
Do you know what I think
you really need?

36:18.059 --> 36:19.761
Yes. I don't want to hear it.

36:19.794 --> 36:21.305
Yes, 'cause
you're afraid
to hear the truth.

36:21.329 --> 36:22.673
It's not the truth
I'm afraid to hear.

36:22.697 --> 36:24.165
It's the word
you're going to use.

36:24.198 --> 36:26.901
You're darn right I'm going
to use it, it's love.
Oh.

36:26.935 --> 36:29.471
A week ago,
I didn't even know
what it meant.

36:29.504 --> 36:32.607
And then I checked into
to the Plaza Hotel
for six wonderful days.

36:32.641 --> 36:33.784
And you know
what happened
to me there?

36:33.808 --> 36:35.810
I promised myself
I wouldn't ask.

36:35.844 --> 36:37.278
I found love.

36:37.311 --> 36:39.781
Spiritual, physical,
and emotional love.

36:39.814 --> 36:41.559
And I don't think
anyone on Earth
should be without it.

36:41.583 --> 36:44.152
I'm not, darling.
I have you.

36:44.185 --> 36:45.996
I'm not talking
about that kind
of love, Mother.

36:46.020 --> 36:47.598
I mean...
I know what
you're talking about.

36:47.622 --> 36:48.923
And you don't want
to discuss it?

36:48.957 --> 36:50.425
Not with you
in the room. (SIGHS)

36:51.292 --> 36:52.594
(HONKS)

36:53.662 --> 36:55.564
That must be Aunt Harriet.

36:57.966 --> 36:58.966
I've got to go.

36:59.133 --> 37:00.368
Some visit.

37:00.401 --> 37:01.903
Just a sneak preview.

37:01.936 --> 37:05.774
I'll see you both on Tuesday
for the world premiere.

37:05.807 --> 37:08.209
Oh. You shouldn't
have run just for me.

37:08.242 --> 37:09.611
Goodbye, love.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.446
I love your new apartment.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.482
I'll see you both on Tuesday.

37:15.183 --> 37:16.485
Geronimo!

37:29.564 --> 37:30.565
Paul, what's the matter?

37:33.602 --> 37:34.803
I just had an interesting talk

37:34.836 --> 37:37.171
with the man down
in the liquor store.

37:37.205 --> 37:39.584
Do you know that we have
some of the greatest
weirdos in the country

37:39.608 --> 37:40.509
living right here
in this building?

37:40.542 --> 37:42.410
No kidding! Like who?

37:42.443 --> 37:44.846
Well, like, to begin with,
in apartment 1C
are the Boscos,

37:44.879 --> 37:46.981
Mr. and Mrs. J. Bosco.
Who are they?

37:47.015 --> 37:48.855
Mr. and Mrs. J. Bosco
are a lovely young couple

37:48.883 --> 37:50.785
who just happen to be
of the same sex.

37:50.819 --> 37:52.721
And no one knows
which one that is.
Crazy!

37:52.754 --> 37:54.889
And in apartment 3C
are Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales.
So...

37:54.923 --> 37:56.734
No, I have not finished.
Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales,

37:56.758 --> 37:59.794
Mr. and Mrs. Armandariz,
and Mr. Calhoun,
who must be the umpire.

37:59.828 --> 38:01.329
Who do you think lives in 4D?

38:01.362 --> 38:03.097
I don't know.
Nobody else does, either.

38:03.131 --> 38:05.175
Nobody's been seen
going in or coming out
in three years!

38:05.199 --> 38:06.635
Except every morning,

38:06.668 --> 38:08.813
there are nine
empty cans of tuna fish
outside the door.

38:08.837 --> 38:10.572
Who do you suppose lives there?

38:10.605 --> 38:13.274
Sounds like a big cat
with a can opener.

38:13.307 --> 38:16.377
Oh, I forgot, Mr. Velasco,
Victor Velasco,
he lives in 6A.

38:16.410 --> 38:17.512
Where's that, on the roof?

38:17.546 --> 38:19.548
The attic.
He lives in the attic!

38:19.581 --> 38:21.550
He's 58 years old.
He skis,
he climbs mountains,

38:21.583 --> 38:22.751
he's been married four times.

38:22.784 --> 38:24.361
He's known as
the Bluebeard
of 10th Street.

38:24.385 --> 38:25.820
What does that mean?

38:25.854 --> 38:27.765
I don't know. It either
means that he attacks
girls on 10th Street

38:27.789 --> 38:29.591
or he's got a blue beard.

38:29.624 --> 38:31.359
Where are you going?

38:31.392 --> 38:33.003
I'm gonna go stand
in the bedroom and work.

38:33.027 --> 38:36.698
If anything comes up,
like the bed or the heat,
just let me know, huh?

38:37.599 --> 38:38.800
(DOOR CLOSING)

38:40.869 --> 38:42.203
(WIND BLOWING)

39:02.256 --> 39:03.792
(WHISPERS) Paul?
Hmm?

39:05.526 --> 39:06.961
Are you asleep?

39:07.896 --> 39:09.764
Just my hands and my feet.

39:13.568 --> 39:14.645
Paul, do you know
what the trouble is?

39:14.669 --> 39:17.471
We're wearing too much clothing.

39:17.505 --> 39:19.841
You know how
the Eskimos keep warm?

39:19.874 --> 39:21.743
They check into a motel.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.118
Paul, do you hate me?

39:30.151 --> 39:31.219
Yes.

39:31.252 --> 39:32.654
Then say it.

39:33.154 --> 39:34.322
I hate you.

39:35.356 --> 39:36.991
Then I hate you.

39:37.025 --> 39:38.226
(SOFT RATTLING)

39:40.695 --> 39:41.806
There's somebody at the door.

39:41.830 --> 39:44.232
If it's the Red Cross,
let them in.

39:44.265 --> 39:46.534
Aren't you going to answer it?

39:46.567 --> 39:48.770
You found the apartment.
You answer it.

40:04.285 --> 40:05.754
(WHISPERS) Paul.

40:12.661 --> 40:13.962
Who are you?

40:13.995 --> 40:15.029
Who are you?

40:15.063 --> 40:16.030
I live here.

40:16.064 --> 40:17.198
So do I.

40:17.231 --> 40:18.833
How delightful!

40:18.867 --> 40:20.835
I hope I didn't disturb you.

40:20.869 --> 40:23.071
My name is Velasco,
Victor Velasco.

40:23.905 --> 40:25.807
The Blue...
From the attic?

40:27.909 --> 40:30.011
I was wondering
if I could use
your bedroom.

40:30.544 --> 40:32.246
The bedroom? No.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.615
Well, I can't get
into my apartment.

40:34.649 --> 40:37.986
I wanted to use
your window and just
crawl out along the ledge.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.487
Oh, did you lose your key?

40:39.520 --> 40:42.590
Oh, no, no. I have
my key, but it no longer
fits the lock.

40:42.623 --> 40:45.393
The penalty
of being four months
behind in the rent.

40:48.629 --> 40:50.331
So, you say you live here?

40:51.833 --> 40:53.201
Just moved in today.

40:53.234 --> 40:56.070
Really?
And what are you,
a folk singer?

40:57.238 --> 40:58.707
No, a wife!
Uh-huh.

40:59.708 --> 41:02.176
You know, of course,
you're unbearably pretty.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.113
All indications
point to my falling
in love with you.

41:08.516 --> 41:11.753
Ah, I see our ratfink landlord

41:11.786 --> 41:13.554
has left a hole in the skylight.

41:13.587 --> 41:14.799
Yeah. Well, he's going
to fix it, won't he?

41:14.823 --> 41:16.725
Oh, I wouldn't count on it.

41:16.758 --> 41:19.260
My bathtub has been
leaking since 1949.
(SIGHS)

41:21.329 --> 41:24.833
Tell me,
does your husband, uh,
work during the day?

41:25.266 --> 41:26.400
Yes.

41:26.434 --> 41:27.836
In an office?

41:28.302 --> 41:29.570
Yes.
Good.

41:29.603 --> 41:31.239
I work at home during the day.

41:31.272 --> 41:34.208
Oh, I predict
interesting complications.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.543
Am I making you nervous?

41:35.576 --> 41:36.444
Very nervous.
(CHUCKLES)

41:36.477 --> 41:38.346
Wonderful!

41:38.379 --> 41:42.016
Once a month
I try to make
pretty young girls nervous

41:42.050 --> 41:44.152
just to keep my ego
from going out.

41:44.185 --> 41:46.587
But I'll save you
a lot of anguish.

41:46.620 --> 41:48.422
I'm six...
I'm 58 years old,

41:49.490 --> 41:50.610
and a thoroughly nice fellow.

41:51.726 --> 41:52.994
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

41:53.027 --> 41:55.663
I'm not!
I wish I were
10 years older.

41:55.696 --> 41:57.531
Older?
Yes.

41:57.565 --> 42:00.601
Why, dirty old men
seem to get away
with a lot more.

42:00.634 --> 42:03.905
You see, I'm still
at the awkward age.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.908
Well, now when do I get
invited down for dinner?

42:06.941 --> 42:10.278
Dinner? Oh, we'd...
We'd love to have you
for dinner

42:10.311 --> 42:11.846
as soon as we get set up.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.882
With newlyweds,
I could starve to death.

42:13.915 --> 42:15.649
Shall we say next Tuesday night?

42:15.683 --> 42:17.819
Tuesday night?
No, my mother's...

42:19.587 --> 42:20.721
Tuesday night's fine.

42:20.755 --> 42:22.290
It's a date.

42:22.323 --> 42:24.468
I'll bring the wine.
You can pay me for it
when I get here.

42:24.492 --> 42:26.027
Oh, which reminds me,

42:26.060 --> 42:29.363
you're invited
to my cocktail party
tomorrow night, 10:00.

42:29.397 --> 42:31.599
You do drink,
don't you?
Yes, of course.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.902
Good. Bring liquor.
Until tomorrow then.

42:33.935 --> 42:36.037
Yeah, if we don't
freeze first.
(CHUCKLES)

42:36.070 --> 42:38.206
You don't know
about the plumbing,
do you?

42:38.239 --> 42:41.275
Everything in this museum
works backwards.

42:41.309 --> 42:44.145
For example, on the steam,
it says, "Turn right,"

42:44.645 --> 42:45.914
so you turn left.

42:45.947 --> 42:48.282
Except I can't reach it.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.784
Will you help me up, please?

42:49.818 --> 42:52.520
Oh! With the greatest
of physical pleasure.

42:52.553 --> 42:54.322
One, two, three, up!

42:54.355 --> 42:55.355
Whoo!

42:59.027 --> 43:00.962
Corie, was there anyone...

43:03.898 --> 43:05.338
We were just
warming up
the apartment.

43:07.301 --> 43:08.502
Uh, Paul...

43:10.438 --> 43:11.906
Whoo!

43:11.940 --> 43:15.076
This is Mr. Velasco
from upstairs.

43:15.109 --> 43:16.753
He was just telling me
that all our plumbing
works backwards.

43:16.777 --> 43:18.246
That's right.

43:18.279 --> 43:20.281
An important thing
to remember is

43:20.314 --> 43:23.517
you have to flush up.
Until tomorrow night then.

43:23.551 --> 43:25.295
What's tomorrow night?
Where's... Where's he going?

43:25.319 --> 43:27.155
Don't forget Tuesday!

43:27.188 --> 43:29.958
What about Tuesday?
What's he doing
in the bedroom?

43:30.391 --> 43:31.860
(WIND BLOWING)

43:51.212 --> 43:53.181
That nut went out the window.

43:53.647 --> 43:54.883
(RINGS)

43:59.653 --> 44:01.022
Hello.

44:01.055 --> 44:02.223
Hello, Mother?
It's me.

44:02.256 --> 44:03.657
Corie, did you hear what I said?

44:03.691 --> 44:05.359
There's an old nut
out on our ledge!

44:05.393 --> 44:07.461
No, nothing's wrong.

44:07.495 --> 44:10.064
Listen, I just want
to confirm our Tuesday
night dinner date.

44:10.098 --> 44:12.366
At 2:00 in the morning?

44:12.400 --> 44:13.944
Well, I just
I want to be sure
you're gonna come.

44:13.968 --> 44:16.237
At 2:00
in the morning?

44:16.270 --> 44:19.874
And, Mother, listen,
wear something, uh,
gay and frivolous.

44:19.908 --> 44:21.348
As a matter of fact,
buy a new dress.

44:21.709 --> 44:23.711
At 2:00 in the morning?

44:23.744 --> 44:25.546
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

44:27.949 --> 44:29.483
Who are you waving at?

44:29.750 --> 44:30.919
Him.

45:04.452 --> 45:07.055
I decided
to meet you here
every day.

45:07.088 --> 45:08.232
It takes you so long
to climb the stairs,

45:08.256 --> 45:09.823
and I can't wait for you.

45:09.857 --> 45:11.168
You will not meet me
here every day.

45:11.192 --> 45:13.627
The bus driver will
think you're my mother.

45:23.437 --> 45:25.206
Hey, do you have
an Aunt Fern?
Yeah.

45:25.239 --> 45:27.341
She sent us
a check today.
Did she?

45:27.375 --> 45:29.043
Boy, do you have
a cheap Aunt Fern!

45:29.077 --> 45:31.179
I'll write and tell her.

45:31.212 --> 45:32.981
Oh, and your mother
called from Philly.

45:33.014 --> 45:36.150
She and your father
are coming up
a week from Sunday.

45:36.184 --> 45:37.261
And your sister
has a new boyfriend!

45:37.285 --> 45:38.619
Huh? Really?
From Rutgers.

45:38.652 --> 45:41.055
Yeah, he has acne,
and they all hate him.
Swell.

45:41.089 --> 45:42.991
Including your sister.
(BOTH LAUGHING)

45:44.025 --> 45:45.026
Did you miss me today?

45:45.059 --> 45:46.961
No.
Why not?

45:46.995 --> 45:49.230
Because you called me
eight times.

45:49.263 --> 45:51.599
I... I don't talk to you
that much when I'm home.

45:51.632 --> 45:53.834
What a grouch!
Hey, how'd it go
in court today?

45:53.867 --> 45:55.103
Well, I was going to...

45:55.136 --> 45:56.604
Gump or Birnbaum?
Birnbaum.

45:56.637 --> 45:57.671
You won?
Yes.

45:57.705 --> 45:58.939
Oh, Paul!

46:00.108 --> 46:01.609
Oh, I'm so proud.

46:03.844 --> 46:05.246
Aren't you happy?

46:05.279 --> 46:06.923
Birnbaum
won the protection
of his good name.

46:06.947 --> 46:08.682
But no damages.
We were awarded 6 cents.

46:08.716 --> 46:10.418
6 cents!
It's the law.

46:10.451 --> 46:12.829
You have to be awarded
something, so the court
made it 6 cents.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.388
Well, how much
of that do you get?

46:14.422 --> 46:16.357
Nothing. Birnbaum gets
the whole 6 cents.

46:16.390 --> 46:18.392
And I get it going
the office tomorrow.

46:18.426 --> 46:22.130
From here on in,
I get all the cases that
come in for a dime or under.

46:25.533 --> 46:28.102
Grouch, grouch, grouch.

46:28.136 --> 46:30.938
You weren't that grouchy
at 6:00 this morning
under the covers.

46:30.971 --> 46:34.342
Do you have to carry on
a personal conversation
with me on the stairs?

46:34.375 --> 46:37.011
Why, what's wrong with it?
(MUMBLES)

46:37.045 --> 46:39.747
Everybody knows
the intimate details
of our life.

46:39.780 --> 46:42.716
Geez, I ring the bell,
and suddenly
we're on the air!

46:42.750 --> 46:44.594
You know, I think I better
make you a drink.
Yeah, that's...

46:44.618 --> 46:46.787
You're supposed to be
charming tonight.

46:46.820 --> 46:48.456
Listen, I've got news for us.

46:48.489 --> 46:50.134
This little dinner
you have planned
for tonight

46:50.158 --> 46:52.126
has got fiasco
written all over it.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.563
Why? You know,
it just may be they have
a lot in common.

46:55.596 --> 46:58.832
(CHUCKLES)
Are you kidding?
Your mother?

46:58.866 --> 47:00.977
You mean that quiet,
dainty little woman
from New Jersey

47:01.001 --> 47:02.046
and the Count of Monte Cristo?

47:02.070 --> 47:04.038
You must be kidding.
Why?

47:04.072 --> 47:05.282
Well, you've seen his apartment.

47:05.306 --> 47:07.741
He wears
Japanese kimonos,
he sleeps on rugs.

47:09.610 --> 47:12.480
Your mother
wears a hair net
and sleeps on a board.

47:13.081 --> 47:14.482
Boof.
(LAUGHS)

47:23.991 --> 47:26.294
Well, maybe we could help her.

47:26.327 --> 47:27.437
I mean, we don't have
to introduce her

47:27.461 --> 47:30.631
as my dull, 52-year-old,
housewife mother.

47:30.664 --> 47:32.342
That wasn't
the exact wording
I had planned here.

47:32.366 --> 47:34.302
But what did you have in mind?

47:34.335 --> 47:36.170
I don't know,
something more glamorous.

47:36.204 --> 47:37.305
A former actress.

47:40.141 --> 47:42.676
You know, of course,
that she was in The Man
Who Came to Dinner.

47:42.710 --> 47:45.679
Your mother? Where?
The East Orange
Women's Club?

47:45.713 --> 47:47.481
I don't know, on Broadway.

47:47.515 --> 47:49.593
And she was in
the original company
of Strange Interlude,

47:49.617 --> 47:52.653
and she had
a small singing part
in Knickerbocker Holiday.

47:54.021 --> 47:55.523
Are you serious?

47:56.590 --> 47:57.791
Cross my heart.

47:59.927 --> 48:01.329
Your mother, an actress?

48:01.362 --> 48:02.362
Yeah.

48:03.697 --> 48:06.367
What? You never
told me this.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.769
Why didn't you ever tell me?

48:08.802 --> 48:11.639
(SIGHS) I don't know.
I didn't think
you'd be interested.

48:11.672 --> 48:12.940
God, that's fascinating!

48:12.973 --> 48:15.075
I can't...
I can't get over that.

48:16.510 --> 48:18.379
You see?
Now you're interested.

48:18.412 --> 48:20.013
It's a lie.
Every bit of it.

48:20.047 --> 48:21.815
I'm going to control myself.

48:24.585 --> 48:25.686
(PANTING)

48:41.001 --> 48:42.236
(CLANGS)

48:47.508 --> 48:49.277
Hello, Mom.
Are you
all right, Mother?

48:49.310 --> 48:50.611
Paul...
Yes, Mom.

48:50.644 --> 48:53.281
In my handbag...
Are some pink pills.

48:53.314 --> 48:55.383
Pink pills?
All right.

48:55.416 --> 48:57.918
I'll be all right
in a minute. I'm just
a little out of breath.

48:57.951 --> 48:59.796
Mother, sit right there.
I'll get you
something to drink.

48:59.820 --> 49:02.923
I had to park the car
three blocks away.

49:02.956 --> 49:06.394
Then it started
to rain, so I ran
the last two blocks.

49:06.427 --> 49:09.497
Then my heel got caught
in the subway grating.

49:09.530 --> 49:12.433
When I pulled
my foot out,
I stepped in a puddle.

49:12.466 --> 49:15.336
Then a cab went by
and splashed
my stockings.

49:15.369 --> 49:17.405
If the hardware store
downstairs was open,

49:17.438 --> 49:19.407
I was going
to buy a knife
and kill myself.

49:19.440 --> 49:20.674
Here, Mother, drink this.

49:20.708 --> 49:22.343
Here's your pill, Mom.

49:26.980 --> 49:28.982
A martini to wash down a pill.

49:29.016 --> 49:30.651
It'll make you feel better.

49:30.684 --> 49:32.653
I had a martini at home.
It made me sick.

49:32.686 --> 49:35.022
That's why I'm taking the pill.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.458

It's just sour cream

49:42.663 --> 49:44.398
I wish you hadn't said that.

49:44.432 --> 49:46.600
Uh, maybe you'd like
to lie down?

49:46.634 --> 49:49.537
No, thank you, dear.
I can't lie down
without my board.

49:50.571 --> 49:53.507
Right now,
all I want to do is
see the apartment.

Oh, yes. Corie had me

Did you know that
he's been married
four times, Mom?

My what?

01:09:35.555 --> 01:09:37.288
Your hand.
There is ice
on the stoop.

01:09:37.323 --> 01:09:39.626
Oh, don't worry about me.
I can manage.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:41.093
(GASPS)

01:09:46.633 --> 01:09:48.968
Ethel.
Are you all right?

01:09:49.001 --> 01:09:50.636
Uh... Oh.

01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:52.738
Well.

01:10:05.217 --> 01:10:06.886
I just can't understand

01:10:06.919 --> 01:10:09.021
how you can be
so unconcerned
about all this.

01:10:09.055 --> 01:10:10.122
I really...
Unconcerned?

01:10:11.524 --> 01:10:12.935
Do you think
I'm gonna get
one wink of sleep

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:15.528
until that phone rings tomorrow?

01:10:15.562 --> 01:10:18.197
I'm scared to death
for my mother.

01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:21.400
And I'm grateful
there's finally something
to be scared about.

01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:24.604
What I'm really
concerned about
is you.

01:10:26.839 --> 01:10:28.107
Me? Me?

01:10:29.842 --> 01:10:33.580
Yeah. I'm beginning
to wonder if you're capable
of having a good time.

01:10:33.613 --> 01:10:35.848
Why? Because I like
to wear my gloves
in winter?

01:10:35.882 --> 01:10:38.117
No.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.521
Because there
isn't the least bit
of adventure in you.

01:10:41.554 --> 01:10:44.657
You know what
you are, Paul?
You're a watcher.

01:10:44.691 --> 01:10:46.368
You're a watcher.
There are watchers
in this world,

01:10:46.392 --> 01:10:47.894
and there are doers.

01:10:47.927 --> 01:10:50.196
And the watchers
sit around watching
the doers do.

01:10:51.564 --> 01:10:54.233
Well, tonight
you watched,
and I did.

01:10:54.266 --> 01:10:56.044
Yeah, well, it was
a little bit harder
to watch what you did

01:10:56.068 --> 01:10:57.813
than it was for you
to do what I was watching.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:00.072
You can't even relax
for one evening.

01:11:02.041 --> 01:11:03.786
I don't know, Paul,
sometimes you act
like a...

01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:05.578
What? Hmm?

01:11:05.612 --> 01:11:07.580
A stuffed shirt?
Is that it?

01:11:07.614 --> 01:11:09.357
I didn't say that.
No, that's what
you were implying.

01:11:09.381 --> 01:11:10.593
Ah, no. That's what
you're anticipating.

01:11:10.617 --> 01:11:12.552
I didn't say
stuffed shirt.
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:15.087 --> 01:11:16.727
But you're extremely
proper and dignified.

01:11:21.828 --> 01:11:24.263
Proper and dignified?
When was I proper
and dignified?

01:11:24.296 --> 01:11:26.041
The other night
at Delfino's, you
were drunk, right?

01:11:26.065 --> 01:11:27.500
Right. I was stoned.

01:11:27.534 --> 01:11:29.435
Exactly.
I didn't even know it

01:11:29.468 --> 01:11:31.170
until you told me
in the morning.

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:36.108
I mean,
you're a funny kind
of drunk, Paul.

01:11:36.142 --> 01:11:38.811
You just sat around
looking unhappy,
watching your coat.

01:11:39.445 --> 01:11:40.780
I was watching my coat

01:11:40.813 --> 01:11:43.550
because I saw
someone else
watching my coat.

01:11:43.583 --> 01:11:45.293
Look, if you want,
I'll get drunk
for you sometime,

01:11:45.317 --> 01:11:46.452
make your hair stand on end.

01:11:46.485 --> 01:11:47.987
(WHILE BRUSHING)
It isn't necessary.

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.431
Do you know
that in Harry's bar
last New Year's Eve,

01:11:49.455 --> 01:11:51.090
I punched an old woman?

01:11:51.123 --> 01:11:52.224
Don't tell me about drunk.

01:11:56.829 --> 01:11:58.669
When else?
When else was I
proper and dignified?

01:11:59.866 --> 01:12:01.801
All the time.

01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:03.712
You're always
dressed right.
You always look right.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.504
You always say the right thing.

01:12:06.505 --> 01:12:07.907
You're very nearly perfect.

01:12:09.308 --> 01:12:11.744
That's a rotten thing to say.

01:12:11.778 --> 01:12:13.589
Before we were married,
I thought you slept
with a tie.

01:12:13.613 --> 01:12:15.281
No, just for very formal sleeps.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:19.619
Boy, you have
absolutely no sense
of the ridiculous.

01:12:19.652 --> 01:12:21.087
Like last Thursday night,

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.723
you wouldn't walk
barefoot with me in
Washington Square Park.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.300
Why not?
Simple answer.
It was 17 degrees.

01:12:25.324 --> 01:12:26.893
Exactly.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.527
It's very logical,
it's very sensible,

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:30.029
and it's no fun.

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:32.364
Maybe you're right.

01:12:32.398 --> 01:12:35.067
Maybe I am
a little bit too proper
and dignified for you.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.703
Maybe you would've been happier

01:12:36.736 --> 01:12:38.480
with somebody
a little bit more
colorful and flamboyant.

01:12:38.504 --> 01:12:39.939
Like the geek.

01:12:39.972 --> 01:12:42.441
Well, it'd be a lot
more laughs than
a stuffed shirt.

01:12:42.474 --> 01:12:43.442
I thought you said I wasn't.

01:12:43.475 --> 01:12:44.744
Well, you are now.

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:48.047
I'm not going to listen to this.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.458
I'm not gonna listen
to this, I have a case
in court in the morning.

01:12:50.482 --> 01:12:51.784
Where are you going?
To sleep.

01:12:51.818 --> 01:12:53.820
Now? How can you
go to sleep now?

01:12:53.853 --> 01:12:56.789
I'm gonna close my eyes
and count knichis.
Good night, dear.

01:12:56.823 --> 01:12:59.191
You cannot
go to sleep now, Paul.
We're having a fight.

01:12:59.225 --> 01:13:00.736
Well, you have the fight.
When you're through,

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.528
would you turn off
these lights, please?

01:13:02.561 --> 01:13:04.563
Oh, that gets me
absolutely insane!

01:13:04.597 --> 01:13:06.465
You can even control
your emotions!

01:13:06.498 --> 01:13:09.201
No, no, now.
I'm just as upset
as you are.

01:13:09.235 --> 01:13:11.804
But when I get hungry,
I eat.
When I get tired, I sleep.

01:13:11.838 --> 01:13:14.173
And you eat and sleep too.
Don't deny it, I've seen you.

01:13:14.206 --> 01:13:15.942
Not in middle of a crisis.

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.044
What crisis?
We're just yelling.

01:13:18.077 --> 01:13:20.046
You don't consider
this a crisis?

01:13:20.079 --> 01:13:21.914
Our whole marriage
is hanging
in the balance.

01:13:22.849 --> 01:13:25.384
It is?
When did this happen?

01:13:25.417 --> 01:13:27.787
Just now.
It has suddenly become
very clear to me

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.256
that you and I have
absolutely nothing
in common.

01:13:30.289 --> 01:13:32.992
Why, because
I won't go walking
barefoot in the park?

01:13:33.025 --> 01:13:35.337
You don't have a case,
Corie. Adultery, yes,
but cold feet, no.

01:13:35.361 --> 01:13:36.729
Don't you oversimplify this.

01:13:36.763 --> 01:13:38.631
I am angry, Paul.
Can't you see that?

01:13:39.065 --> 01:13:42.601
It's 2:15.

01:13:42.635 --> 01:13:45.471
If I can get to sleep
in half an hour, I can get
about five hours sleep.

01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:47.816
I'll call you from court
tomorrow, and we'll fight
over the phone. Hmm?

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.241
You will not go to sleep, Paul.

01:13:49.275 --> 01:13:52.544
You will stay here
and fight to save
our marriage!

01:13:52.578 --> 01:13:55.181
If our marriage hinges
on those fishbowls
and pelmenchki,

01:13:55.214 --> 01:13:56.415
it is not worth saving.

01:13:56.448 --> 01:13:59.318
Now, dear, I'm crawling into
our tiny little single bed.

01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:01.797
If you care to join me,
we're sleeping from
left to right tonight.

01:14:01.821 --> 01:14:04.556
You won't discuss it!
You're afraid
to discuss it!

01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:06.726
I married a coward!

01:14:06.759 --> 01:14:09.561
Would you bring in a pail?
The closet's dripping.

01:14:09.595 --> 01:14:11.898
Oh, I hate you!
I really, really hate you!

01:14:11.931 --> 01:14:14.667
Listen! All right,
wait a minute, Corie.

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:15.911
There's one thing
I've learned in court.

01:14:15.935 --> 01:14:17.603
Be careful when you're
tired and angry.

01:14:17.636 --> 01:14:19.181
You may say something
you will soon regret.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.339
I am now tired and angry.

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:21.808
And a coward!

01:14:22.775 --> 01:14:24.210
Listen, maybe you're right then.

01:14:24.243 --> 01:14:26.679
Maybe we don't have
anything in common.

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.415
Maybe two people should
have more than just
a blood test first.

01:14:29.448 --> 01:14:31.884
Maybe they should
be checked first for
a little common sense,

01:14:31.918 --> 01:14:34.020
understanding,
and emotional maturity!

01:14:35.254 --> 01:14:37.289
All right.

01:14:37.323 --> 01:14:40.092
Why don't
you get it passed
by the Supreme Court?

01:14:40.126 --> 01:14:42.537
Only those couples
bearing a certificate
from their psychiatrist

01:14:42.561 --> 01:14:45.397
proving that they're
emotionally mature
can be married.

01:14:47.033 --> 01:14:48.835
Oh, listen...
Don't touch me!

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:54.140
Don't you lay a finger on me!
I can't stand
having you near me!

01:14:54.173 --> 01:14:55.884
What?
I don't even want to be
in the same room with you!

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:57.609
What's going on here?
You're hysterical.

01:14:57.643 --> 01:14:59.645
I am not hysterical!

01:14:59.678 --> 01:15:01.413
I know exactly
what I'm saying, Paul.

01:15:01.447 --> 01:15:03.215
It's all over between us.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.785
And it's never going
to be any good anymore.

01:15:05.818 --> 01:15:07.586
(MUTTERING)
I'm sorry.
I don't want to cry.

01:15:07.619 --> 01:15:09.155
Cry, please. Go ahead.

01:15:09.188 --> 01:15:11.323
Don't you tell me when to cry!

01:15:11.357 --> 01:15:14.326
I'm gonna cry when
I feel like crying.
(SNIFFLES)

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.096
And I'm not gonna have
my cry until you are out
of this apartment.

01:15:17.129 --> 01:15:18.729
What do you mean
"out of this apartment"?

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.567
Well, you certainly don't think

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.111
we're going to live
here anymore, do you?

01:15:23.135 --> 01:15:24.135
After this?

01:15:24.804 --> 01:15:26.105
Are you serious?

01:15:26.138 --> 01:15:28.474
Of course
I'm serious, Paul!
I want a divorce!

01:15:29.175 --> 01:15:30.709
Divorce!

01:15:30.743 --> 01:15:32.320
I'm sorry, Paul.
I can't discuss it anymore.

01:15:32.344 --> 01:15:33.379
Where are you going?

01:15:33.412 --> 01:15:34.881
To bed.

01:15:34.914 --> 01:15:37.116
You can't, not now.
You did before.

01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:40.286
In the middle of a fight,
this is in the middle
of a divorce.

01:15:40.319 --> 01:15:42.530
I'm sorry, Paul.
I can't talk to you
when you are hysterical.

01:15:42.554 --> 01:15:44.356
I want to know
why you want a divorce.

01:15:47.493 --> 01:15:48.493
Huh?

01:15:50.729 --> 01:15:51.898
Why?

01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:56.803
Because you and I
have absolutely
nothing in common.

01:15:56.836 --> 01:15:58.370
Nothing in common?

01:16:00.039 --> 01:16:02.141
What about the six days
at The Plaza, Corie?

01:16:03.175 --> 01:16:04.977
Six days does not a week make.

01:16:07.346 --> 01:16:08.948
What does that mean?

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.185
I don't know!

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.122
I don't know what it means.

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:21.360
All I know is that
I want a divorce.

01:16:26.065 --> 01:16:27.834
You know, I think you mean it.

01:16:27.867 --> 01:16:29.301
You mean this?

01:16:29.635 --> 01:16:30.803
I do.

01:16:32.104 --> 01:16:33.239
I really do.

I thought you
weren't going to cry.
Well, I am!

I'm gonna cry,
I'm going to have
the biggest cry

01:16:52.825 --> 01:16:54.793
I've ever had in my whole life,

01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:56.528
and I'm going to enjoy it!

01:16:57.596 --> 01:16:59.165
Because I'm gonna cry so hard

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:01.033
I'm gonna keep you
awake all night.

No, thank you.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:16.102
(SNEEZES)

01:19:18.004 --> 01:19:19.405
God bless him.

01:19:22.474 --> 01:19:24.452
If that's for tonight,
you needn't bother.
I have my own dinner.

01:19:24.476 --> 01:19:26.312
I thought you were moving out.

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:28.747
I haven't had a chance
to look for a room yet.

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.916
I work during the day, you know.

01:19:30.949 --> 01:19:32.918
You'll look tonight.

01:19:32.951 --> 01:19:34.953
I happen to be
coming down with a cold.

01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:36.722
That's why I'm home early.

01:19:36.755 --> 01:19:39.691
I just thought I'd take
a couple of aspirins and
get right into the sofa.

01:19:43.262 --> 01:19:45.797
I'm sure you can find someplace.

01:19:45.831 --> 01:19:47.266
You could stay at your club.

01:19:47.299 --> 01:19:49.335
It's not that kind of a club.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:52.138
It's a locker room
and a handball court.

01:19:52.171 --> 01:19:54.606
To sleep over, I'd have
to keep winning the serve.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:58.044
Hello, Mrs. Bratter,
Mr. Bratter.

01:19:58.077 --> 01:19:59.078
How's every little thing?

01:19:59.745 --> 01:20:01.247
The little things are fine.

01:20:02.081 --> 01:20:03.582
Shall I charge it, Mr. Bratter?

01:20:03.615 --> 01:20:06.052
Charge it to Mrs. Bratter.
It's a new account.

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:08.154
The grapes are his.

01:20:15.161 --> 01:20:17.063

It's open!

01:20:28.774 --> 01:20:30.242
Hi.
(PANTING) Hello again.

01:20:31.143 --> 01:20:32.711
Phone's out of order.

01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:34.780
Yeah. I know.

01:20:34.813 --> 01:20:36.648
I wouldn't be up here
on a social call.

01:20:37.783 --> 01:20:40.452
Hey, you did a real nice job.

01:20:40.486 --> 01:20:41.887
Thank you.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.031
Know anybody that
might want to rent it?

01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:45.424
Rent it?
You moving already?

01:20:45.457 --> 01:20:47.259
Yeah, I'm looking
for a smaller place.

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:50.896
Smaller than this,
they're not easy to find.
(CHUCKLES)

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.664
So, how do you
like married life?

01:20:54.032 --> 01:20:55.501
Very interesting.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.938
Hello.
I'm the telephone man.

01:20:59.971 --> 01:21:01.507
I'm the husband.

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:06.778
Well, let's see what's
wrong with the phone.

01:21:26.832 --> 01:21:27.832
It's dead.

01:21:28.967 --> 01:21:30.802
I know.
It was murdered
last night.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:39.044
I'll be out of here
as fast as I can.

01:21:39.077 --> 01:21:41.347
Take your time.
Nobody's rushing you.

01:21:48.587 --> 01:21:50.722
Is there any beer
in the house?
(SNIFFLES)

01:21:57.696 --> 01:22:00.166
I said,
"Is there any beer
in the house?"

01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:05.671
Would you like me to look?

01:22:07.072 --> 01:22:08.307
There's no beer in the house.

01:22:08.907 --> 01:22:10.442
There is no beer.

01:22:17.048 --> 01:22:18.350
(HARRY GASPS)

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.622
That's my trouble, beer.

01:22:23.655 --> 01:22:26.124
I can drink 10 cans
in a night of beer.

01:22:28.627 --> 01:22:29.728
(HUMMING)

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.168

My laundry come back today?

01:22:56.087 --> 01:22:57.889
Yes, your laundry
came back today.

01:22:59.258 --> 01:23:00.759
They stuffed your shirts
beautifully.

Yeah.

Just a moment.
It's Aunt Harriet.

01:23:48.039 --> 01:23:49.159
I don't have an Aunt Harriet.

01:23:54.546 --> 01:23:57.215
I guess you won't
be needing me anymore.
Goodbye.

01:23:57.249 --> 01:23:59.318
Aunt Harriet, can you
hang on a second?

01:24:01.687 --> 01:24:03.221
When do I get it?

01:24:03.255 --> 01:24:04.690
Get what?

01:24:04.723 --> 01:24:07.058
My divorce,
when do I get my divorce?

01:24:07.092 --> 01:24:09.571
How should I know?
They didn't even send
the marriage license yet.

01:24:09.595 --> 01:24:10.896
I want you out of here tonight.

01:24:10.929 --> 01:24:12.998
Right now.
Fine. Just great.
I'll get my bag.

01:24:13.031 --> 01:24:14.433
I'll pack my wet suits.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:17.235
Hi, Aunt Harriet.
Yeah, what's wrong?

01:24:18.304 --> 01:24:20.339
I'll go sleep
in the park, where
it's dry and warm.

01:24:20.372 --> 01:24:22.441
No, mother's not with me.

01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:24.543
Uh-uh, she left about
2:00 this morning.

01:24:25.076 --> 01:24:26.578
Yeah? What happened?

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:28.479
What?

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:30.816
Mother?

01:24:31.717 --> 01:24:33.652
My mother?

01:24:33.685 --> 01:24:35.887
Are you sure?
What's the matter?
What happened?

01:24:35.921 --> 01:24:38.324
No. My phone's been
out of order all day.

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.259
Aunt Harriet, listen.
Don't get excited.

01:24:41.293 --> 01:24:44.129
I'll call you back
as soon as I find out
anything. Yeah, goodbye.

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:45.239
What's the matter
with your mother?

01:24:45.263 --> 01:24:46.632
Mother didn't
come home last night.

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:48.033
God, her bed
hasn't been slept in.

01:24:48.066 --> 01:24:49.635
I'm gonna call the police.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:52.037
Take it easy.
Just take it easy.
There's nothing to be...

01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:55.073
Don't you understand?
Mother wasn't in her
bedroom this morning.

01:24:55.106 --> 01:24:56.408
Maybe her back
was bothering her,

01:24:56.442 --> 01:24:57.585
and she fell asleep
on the ironing board.

01:24:57.609 --> 01:24:59.711
Oh, would you
just go away?
Just go away.

01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:03.958
Where are you going?
Upstairs to find out
what happened to my mother.

01:25:03.982 --> 01:25:05.351
And you better not come back

01:25:05.384 --> 01:25:07.185
'cause I'm buying
a big dog tomorrow.

01:25:07.218 --> 01:25:09.020
That's fine, just fine.

01:25:09.054 --> 01:25:11.299
Now you'll have somebody
to walk barefoot
in the park with.

01:25:11.323 --> 01:25:14.092
(LAUGHS)
A dog. That's a laugh.

01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:16.362
Wait till she tries
to take him out for a walk,

01:25:16.395 --> 01:25:18.835
he'll get one look
at those stairs and go
right for her throat.

Mr. Velasco,
can I see you
for a minute?

01:25:25.471 --> 01:25:28.206
Here is a dog.
A little doggie.

01:25:28.239 --> 01:25:30.909
Fortunately,
I don't need anybody
to protect me, sweetheart,

01:25:30.942 --> 01:25:35.246
because I am a man,
independent, mature,

What? Is it your mother?

01:26:41.847 --> 01:26:43.615
Corie, what is it, an accident?

01:26:43.649 --> 01:26:45.984
Corie, for Pete's sake,
what's it about?

01:26:46.017 --> 01:26:48.253
Daughter, listen,
it's not the way
it looks at all.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:49.455
Good God.

01:26:50.822 --> 01:26:52.958
Corie, you've got to believe me.

01:26:52.991 --> 01:26:54.493
Somebody believe me.

01:26:58.296 --> 01:26:59.598
I warned her.

01:27:01.266 --> 01:27:03.334
I warned her, and I was right.

01:27:03.368 --> 01:27:05.737
He warned me, and he was right.

01:27:05.771 --> 01:27:07.405
It must have been
the drinks, Corie.

01:27:07.439 --> 01:27:09.274
I had a great deal
to drink last night.

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:12.578
I had martinis, vodka,
coffee, black bean soup,
and Ouzo.

01:27:16.448 --> 01:27:17.983
That's not my problem.

01:27:18.016 --> 01:27:19.618
I'm well out of it now.

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:23.655
Ah!

01:27:35.734 --> 01:27:38.937
And after I fell,
Victor picked me up
and carried me inside.

01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:41.907
I couldn't walk
because my shoes
fell down the sewer.

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.341
You don't have
to explain, Mother.

01:27:43.374 --> 01:27:44.743
He started to carry me up here,

01:27:44.776 --> 01:27:46.778
but his hat fell over his eyes,

01:27:46.812 --> 01:27:49.648
and we fell
down the stairs,
into apartment 3C.

01:27:50.215 --> 01:27:52.117
I fell on his foot.

01:27:52.150 --> 01:27:54.028
I thought we were gonna
have a nice sociable evening.

01:27:54.052 --> 01:27:56.321
Then Mr. Gonzales,
Mr. Armandariz,
and Mr. Calhoun

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:57.789
carried us both up there

01:27:57.823 --> 01:28:00.158
and put us down on the rugs.

01:28:00.191 --> 01:28:01.936
When I woke up
in the morning
Victor was gone,

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.962
and I was there in his bathrobe.

01:28:03.995 --> 01:28:05.396
Oh, Mother!

01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:07.232
I swear that's the truth, Corie!

you got there.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:31.055
What?

01:28:32.323 --> 01:28:33.825
Huh?
Your coat.

01:28:35.794 --> 01:28:37.863
I'll make you a trade.
What have you got?

01:28:38.496 --> 01:28:39.731
Nothing.

01:28:40.532 --> 01:28:41.967
It's a deal!

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:47.505
You must believe me.
I've told you everything.

01:28:47.539 --> 01:28:49.340
Then where are your clothes?

01:28:49.374 --> 01:28:51.376
That I can't tell you.
Why not?

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:52.486
You won't believe me.
I'll believe you.

No, you won't.
I will.

I don't believe you.

you wouldn't believe me?

been so humiliated
in all my life.

I kept having
the most horrible
nightmares.

I kept dreaming
my fingers
were falling off

01:29:11.863 --> 01:29:13.765
because I couldn't make a fist.

Mr. Velasco, are you all right?

01:29:26.011 --> 01:29:28.446
If a broken toe
is all right, I'm fine.

Mr. Victor.
Mr. Velasco.

I couldn't get up
the ladder again.

01:29:33.518 --> 01:29:35.362
Ethel, did you tell Corie
what happened last night?

01:29:35.386 --> 01:29:36.655
Why? What happened last night?

01:29:36.688 --> 01:29:37.923
Ooh, last night.
Yes.

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:40.358
Yes.
Take his arm, Mother.

01:29:40.391 --> 01:29:43.662
I knew I would come to this,
being helped by women.

01:29:43.695 --> 01:29:45.764
(GROANS)
Oh, dear, does
your foot hurt?

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:47.666
Compared to my stomach, no.

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:50.636
I think I have a new ailment

01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:53.171
which I shall call
"intestinal volcano".

01:29:54.005 --> 01:29:55.540
Are there little men in there

01:29:55.573 --> 01:29:57.508
running around in spiked shoes?

01:29:57.542 --> 01:29:59.277
And pointy steel helmets,

01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:01.546
and they keep
jumping up and down,
up and down.

01:30:01.579 --> 01:30:03.715
How long has this been going on?

01:30:03.749 --> 01:30:06.785
It hardly ever happens,
except after every meal.

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.754
I knew it.
Welcome to my club.

01:30:08.787 --> 01:30:10.388
I think you have an ulcer.

01:30:10.421 --> 01:30:12.490
An ulcer? Me?
From what?

01:30:12.523 --> 01:30:15.060
Too many spicy foods.

01:30:15.093 --> 01:30:17.495
You'll have to get used
to taking little pink pills.

01:30:17.528 --> 01:30:19.097
Oh, I'd rather die,

01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:20.866
but first I must get rid
of this headache.

01:30:20.899 --> 01:30:23.034
Corie, do you have
about 300 aspirins?

01:30:25.804 --> 01:30:28.674
You know, Ethel, I don't think
I'm as young as I think I am.

01:30:28.707 --> 01:30:31.009
Why do you say that?
Well, isn't that obvious?

01:30:31.042 --> 01:30:33.444
Last night, I couldn't
carry you up the stairs.

01:30:33.478 --> 01:30:35.113
I can't eat rich food anymore.

01:30:35.814 --> 01:30:37.115
And I dye my hair, my...

01:30:37.148 --> 01:30:38.817
Well, it's very nice.
Thank you.

01:30:40.551 --> 01:30:42.353
So are you.

01:30:42.387 --> 01:30:45.757
You know, Ethel,
you are
a very unusual woman.

01:30:45.791 --> 01:30:47.358
Unusual? In what way?

01:30:47.392 --> 01:30:49.695
VICTOR: I took
a long look
at you last night.

01:30:49.728 --> 01:30:51.138
Do you know what
you are, Ethel?
What?

01:30:51.162 --> 01:30:52.297
A good sport.

01:30:52.330 --> 01:30:53.799
Oh, a good sport.

01:30:53.832 --> 01:30:55.600
To have gone all through
you did last night.

01:30:55.633 --> 01:30:58.169
The trip to Staten Island,
the strange food,

01:30:58.203 --> 01:31:00.371
being carried up
to my apartment like that.

01:31:00.739 --> 01:31:02.307
(CHUCKLING)

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.242
If you remember, eh?

01:31:04.275 --> 01:31:06.244
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:31:11.917 --> 01:31:15.520
Mr. Velasco,
where are my clothes?

01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:17.823
Oh, your clothes. Here.

01:31:17.856 --> 01:31:20.291
I'm sure I wore more than that.

01:31:20.325 --> 01:31:21.993
It's a cleaning ticket.

01:31:22.027 --> 01:31:23.862
They're sending
them up at 4:00.

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.430
Oh, they're at the cleaners.

01:31:26.898 --> 01:31:28.700
When did I take them off?

01:31:28.734 --> 01:31:31.536
You didn't. You were
drenched and out cold.

01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:33.271
Gonzales took them off.

01:31:33.304 --> 01:31:35.907
Mr. Gonzales?
Not Mister...
Dr. Gonzales.

01:31:35.941 --> 01:31:37.909
Oh, the doctor.
Dr. Gonzales.

01:31:37.943 --> 01:31:39.144
I guess that's all right, then.

01:31:39.177 --> 01:31:41.546
How convenient to have
an M.D. in the building.

01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.082
He is not an M.D.
He's a doctor
of philosophy.

01:31:44.115 --> 01:31:46.084
(LAUGHING)

01:31:50.555 --> 01:31:52.657
Here. Aspirin.

01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:54.301
No, thank you.
I'm feeling
much better now.

01:31:54.325 --> 01:31:55.827
I'll take them.

01:31:56.427 --> 01:31:58.363
Well, I must go.

01:31:58.396 --> 01:32:01.032
Someone is calling
about renting
my apartment.

01:32:01.967 --> 01:32:04.302
From now on,
I take elevators.
(GROANS)

01:32:05.871 --> 01:32:07.591
Oh, dear,
is there anything
I can do for you?

01:32:09.741 --> 01:32:11.977
Yes, there is.

01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:14.412
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?
Me?

01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:16.381
That is
if you don't mind
eating plain food.

01:32:18.016 --> 01:32:20.919
I love plain food.
Good.

01:32:20.952 --> 01:32:23.421
I'll call the New York
hospital for a reservation.

01:32:23.454 --> 01:32:25.056
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

01:32:25.090 --> 01:32:26.792
Whatever you say, Victor.

01:32:28.259 --> 01:32:30.796
Now, that's funny.
I was getting
used to Walter.

01:32:35.233 --> 01:32:37.335
You know what
I could use
right now?

01:32:38.469 --> 01:32:39.737
A double Ouzo.

01:32:43.541 --> 01:32:45.443
What I really could use
is a new outfit.

01:32:47.378 --> 01:32:48.980
Mother, can I talk to you?

01:32:49.014 --> 01:32:51.783
Do you realize
I slept without
a board last night?

01:32:51.817 --> 01:32:53.518
For the first time in years,

01:32:53.551 --> 01:32:55.420
I slept without a board!

01:32:55.453 --> 01:32:57.188
Mother...

01:32:57.222 --> 01:33:00.258
You don't suppose Ouzo
is some kind of a Greek
miracle drug, do you?

01:33:03.094 --> 01:33:05.072
Mother, there's something
I've got to talk
to you about.

01:33:05.096 --> 01:33:06.941
Oh, Corie, how sweet of you.
You're worried about me.

01:33:06.965 --> 01:33:08.499
I'm not worried about you.

01:33:09.734 --> 01:33:11.069
Oh, my hair.

01:33:11.102 --> 01:33:13.071
I wonder what I
could do with my hair?

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.420
Paul and I are
getting a divorce.

01:33:18.509 --> 01:33:20.011
A divorce?
That's right.

01:33:21.346 --> 01:33:23.781
Paul and I are
splitting up for good.

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:25.383
You and Paul?

01:33:26.417 --> 01:33:28.586
I don't believe you.

01:33:28.619 --> 01:33:30.264
You saw him leaving
the apartment
with his suitcase.

01:33:30.288 --> 01:33:32.257
What did you think
he had in there?

01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:34.059
I don't know,
I know how neat he is.

01:33:34.092 --> 01:33:35.894
I thought maybe the garbage.

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:39.464
Mother, I believe you.
Why don't you believe me?

01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:42.067
Because in my entire life,

01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:44.340
I've never seen
two people more in love
than you and Paul.

01:33:49.274 --> 01:33:51.142
Well, maybe that
was true yesterday,

01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:54.579
but it sure
isn't true today.
(SNIFFLES)

01:33:56.982 --> 01:34:00.318
It couldn't have
been all your fault.

01:34:00.351 --> 01:34:05.423
No? Because of me,
you were running around
without your clothes

01:34:05.456 --> 01:34:07.392
and Paul is out there
in the streets
with a cold,

01:34:07.425 --> 01:34:09.494
looking for a place to sleep.

01:34:09.527 --> 01:34:11.096
Whose fault is that?

01:34:11.796 --> 01:34:13.031
Yours.

01:34:14.332 --> 01:34:16.902
You want
to know something
that may shock you?

01:34:16.935 --> 01:34:18.403
I still love you.

01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:21.172
And Paul loves you, too.

01:34:22.307 --> 01:34:23.508
And I love him.

01:34:24.642 --> 01:34:26.677
I don't know what he wants.

01:34:26.711 --> 01:34:28.579
I don't know how
to make him happy.

01:34:31.883 --> 01:34:34.452
What am I going to do, Mother?

01:34:34.485 --> 01:34:37.355
That's the first time
you've asked my advice
since you were 10.

01:34:41.859 --> 01:34:43.561
It's really very simple.

01:34:45.296 --> 01:34:48.533
All you have to do
is give up a little bit
of you for him.

01:34:49.901 --> 01:34:51.970
Don't make everything a game,

01:34:52.003 --> 01:34:54.973
just late at night
in that little room
upstairs.

01:34:55.907 --> 01:34:57.642
Take care of him.

01:34:57.675 --> 01:35:00.145
Make him feel important.

01:35:01.947 --> 01:35:05.483
If you can do that,
you'll have a happy
and wonderful marriage,

01:35:05.516 --> 01:35:07.485
like two out of
every 10 couples.

01:35:08.987 --> 01:35:10.922
You'll be one of the two, baby.

01:35:14.825 --> 01:35:16.928
Now get out of here
and go find him.

01:35:17.695 --> 01:35:19.197
I've got a date.

01:35:21.566 --> 01:35:23.566
Aunt Harriet isn't going
to believe a word of this.

01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:26.313
If you don't hear
from me tomorrow,

01:35:26.337 --> 01:35:28.639
I'll be in
the National Hotel
in Mexico City,

01:35:28.673 --> 01:35:30.508
room 703.

"This is crazy.

How about that?

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.749
You're going to get pneumonia.

If that's what you want,
that's what I'll get.

01:40:08.453 --> 01:40:10.688
Paul, would you
get these shoes off?
They're soaking wet.

01:40:10.721 --> 01:40:12.857
I can't. My feet
have swellened.

01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:14.935

let you out of here.

get into bed?

Not that sick.

01:40:31.242 --> 01:40:32.710
No, Paul, stop it!

01:40:33.678 --> 01:40:34.879
Stop it.

01:40:34.912 --> 01:40:36.414
I mean it. Stop it.

01:40:40.418 --> 01:40:42.353
Ha! Come here, cutie.
Come on, Paul, stop it.

01:40:43.187 --> 01:40:45.456
No! I'm warning you.

01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:47.725
Hey, you're pretty when
you're mean and rotten.

01:40:47.758 --> 01:40:49.694
Paul, keep away from me!
I'm gonna scream!

01:40:49.727 --> 01:40:51.696
Shh!

01:40:51.729 --> 01:40:53.607
There's snow on the roof.
We'll have an avalanche.

01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:56.267
You're not supposed
to be walking around.
You've got a fever.

01:40:56.301 --> 01:40:57.781
Stand still,
the both of you.
(SHRIEKS)

01:41:07.945 --> 01:41:10.348
Hey...
Open this door.

01:41:10.381 --> 01:41:11.982
I can't. I'm scared.

01:41:12.417 --> 01:41:13.851
Of me?
Yes.

01:41:13.884 --> 01:41:15.686
Why?

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.189
'Cause it's not you anymore.
I want the old Paul back.

01:41:19.223 --> 01:41:21.959
(SCOFFS) That fuddy-duddy?

01:41:21.992 --> 01:41:24.295
He's not a fuddy-duddy.
He's strong
and dependable.

01:41:24.329 --> 01:41:25.830
And he takes care of me

01:41:25.863 --> 01:41:27.398
and protects me
from people like you.

01:41:28.866 --> 01:41:31.702
I just want him to know
how much I love him.

01:41:31.736 --> 01:41:34.539
And I'm gonna make
everything here exactly
the way he wants it.

01:41:34.572 --> 01:41:36.106
I'll fix the hole
in the skylight

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:38.208
and the leak in the closet.

01:41:38.242 --> 01:41:40.144
And I'll put in a bathtub.

01:41:40.177 --> 01:41:41.822
And I'll even carry him
upstairs every night,

01:41:41.846 --> 01:41:43.748
'cause that's
how much I love him.

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:50.355
Paul?

01:41:55.225 --> 01:41:56.394
Paul?

01:42:00.665 --> 01:42:01.665
Hey.

01:42:05.169 --> 01:42:06.303
Paul?

01:42:10.174 --> 01:42:11.275
Paul!

01:42:11.308 --> 01:42:13.478
(YELPS)

01:42:13.511 --> 01:42:15.413
My God, you idiot,
you're gonna kill yourself!

01:42:15.446 --> 01:42:16.981
Come down from there.
No.

01:42:18.349 --> 01:42:20.485
I want to be a nut,

01:42:20.518 --> 01:42:22.653
just like everybody else
in this building!

01:42:22.687 --> 01:42:24.989
(SCREAMS) No.

01:42:25.022 --> 01:42:27.625
No, Paul, I don't want
you to be a nut.
Come down, please.

01:42:27.958 --> 01:42:28.958
No.

01:42:30.695 --> 01:42:35.132
Not until you've
said it again,
loud and clear.

01:42:35.165 --> 01:42:36.434
Anything, Paul, anything.

01:42:37.902 --> 01:42:38.969
My husband...

01:42:39.003 --> 01:42:40.337
My husband...

01:42:40.938 --> 01:42:41.972
(SNEEZING)

01:42:42.807 --> 01:42:43.941
Paul Bratter...

01:42:43.974 --> 01:42:45.109
Paul Bratter...

01:42:46.377 --> 01:42:48.278
Rising young attorney...

01:42:48.312 --> 01:42:50.047
(SCREAMING)
Rising young...

01:42:51.916 --> 01:42:53.451
Rising young attorney...

01:42:56.153 --> 01:42:58.556
Is a lousy, stinking drunk.

01:42:59.356 --> 01:43:01.058
Is a lousy, stinking drunk.

01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:03.093
And I love him.

01:43:05.329 --> 01:43:07.432
I love you, too, Corie.

01:43:08.933 --> 01:43:11.802
Even when
I didn't like you,
I loved you.

01:43:11.836 --> 01:43:13.804
Then, Paul, would
you please come
down from there?

01:43:19.176 --> 01:43:20.678
I can't, not now.

01:43:20.711 --> 01:43:21.711
Why?

01:43:22.713 --> 01:43:24.148
'Cause I'm going to be sick.

01:43:24.181 --> 01:43:25.616
Oh, no!
Oh, yes.

01:43:27.485 --> 01:43:29.685
Don't move, Paul.
I'm gonna be right up
there to get you.

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:32.857
Would you do that?
Because I'm getting
panicky.

01:43:33.558 --> 01:43:35.493
Paul, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

01:43:37.127 --> 01:43:39.129
Corie? Co... Corie!

01:43:39.163 --> 01:43:40.397
Corie!
What?

01:43:40.431 --> 01:43:42.132
What, Paul, what?

01:43:42.166 --> 01:43:43.534
Don't leave me.

01:43:43.568 --> 01:43:45.470
Paul, listen,
you're gonna be all right.

01:43:45.503 --> 01:43:47.438
Just hold on tight
and try to be calm.

01:43:48.606 --> 01:43:50.608
How? (STAMMERING)
What should I do?

01:43:52.009 --> 01:43:54.211
What should he do?
What should he do?

01:43:54.244 --> 01:43:55.312
Sing.

01:43:55.345 --> 01:43:56.747
Sing?

01:43:56.781 --> 01:43:58.683
Sing, Paul.
Sing as loud as you can.

01:43:58.716 --> 01:44:00.785
And don't stop till I get there.

01:44:00.818 --> 01:44:02.095
You promise me
you'll keep singing.

01:44:02.119 --> 01:44:03.921
I promise.
I'll keep singing.

01:44:03.954 --> 01:44:05.331
Okay, now don't stop
until I get there, Paul.

01:44:05.355 --> 01:44:07.492
I love you, darling.
Keep singing, Paul.

01:44:08.225 --> 01:44:09.225
Corie? Corie, Corie!

01:44:10.194 --> 01:44:11.496
Corie!
What, Paul?

01:44:12.597 --> 01:44:13.631
What song should I sing?

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:16.601
Shama, shama.

01:44:19.103 --> 01:44:20.638
Shama?
Sing it, Paul.

01:44:20.671 --> 01:44:23.440
(SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:27.010
Shama, shama.

01:44:28.012 --> 01:44:29.914
(PAUL SINGING DRUNKENLY)

01:44:37.354 --> 01:44:39.123
(CONTINUES SINGING)

01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.175
What's happening?
I don't know.

01:44:58.208 --> 01:44:59.944
They're looking up
at this house.

01:45:12.857 --> 01:45:13.991
Oh, Paul.

01:45:22.232 --> 01:45:23.701
Oh, good.
They made up.

01:45:33.243 --> 01:45:35.680
* La la la...

01:45:40.718 --> 01:45:44.855
* So come along My barefoot love

01:45:44.889 --> 01:45:48.058
* To the fields
that shine with spring

01:45:48.993 --> 01:45:52.730
* Though it's 10 below Let me go

01:45:54.765 --> 01:45:57.234
* Knee-deep in daisies
with you *
