00:03.253 --> 00:06.290
3-bedroom, 2-bath,
landscaped backyard,

00:06.340 --> 00:08.422
a little gazebo thing.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.081
It's beautiful.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.511
On sale, half-price.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.002
Double homicide will do that
to your property value.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.968
Uhh. See, even this
is more interesting than that movie.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.006
- What?
- Come on.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.517
Yeah, okay, you're right.
You can pick next time.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.519
So what happened in there?

00:22.564 --> 00:25.146
I mean, two houses down from me--
I had no idea.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.602
It's pretty straightfonNard.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.564
Guy comes home, finds his wife in bed
with someone else...

00:29.613 --> 00:31.649
Ooh, crime of passion, huh?

00:31.698 --> 00:33.609
Love--l'd be out of work without it.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.987
So, what, did the guyjust confess?

00:36.036 --> 00:39.199
Well, no, not right away.
Took a little more convincing than that.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.660
ljust told him he'd feel a lot better
if he let it all out.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.744
Hmm.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.087
Seemed kind of relieved when he told me.
They usually are.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.583
lt's strangely like being a therapist.

00:48.632 --> 00:53.251
And here I thought Homicide
was all sunglasses and shiny suits,

00:53.303 --> 00:56.136
writing on glass, walking on water...

00:56.682 --> 00:57.797
(Andy chuckles)

00:59.309 --> 01:00.924
You're something else, you know that?

01:00.978 --> 01:02.093
Thank you.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.471
And you have no idea how amazing you are.

01:05.524 --> 01:09.984
(Holiday Parade)
.l‘ Everybody longs for something, I J‘

01:10.028 --> 01:14.146
J‘ I'd give it all again to feel it .l‘

01:14.199 --> 01:15.188
You cold?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.076
No.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.487
l'm perfect.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.620
(Traci) Homicide loot's
got some smooth moves.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.332
(Andy) No, it was perfect--

01:29.381 --> 01:30.871
I mean, the whole date.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.301
Romantic and honest and...

01:33.760 --> 01:35.216
actually, a little bit weird for me.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.929
You know what's weird is you guys making out
in front of a murder house.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.428
Would it ever strike you that Luke's
a little obsessed with death?

01:42.477 --> 01:44.854
Well, he's a homicide detective.
It's sort of his job.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.887
I'm just saying he's not perfect,
which is good

01:46.940 --> 01:48.316
because perfect is boring.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.768
Yeah, perfect would really suck.

01:49.818 --> 01:50.898
(both laugh)

01:52.070 --> 01:53.401
(engine sputters)
Eww.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.562
(Traci mutters, frustrated)

01:58.952 --> 02:01.113
(Andy) Afternoon, boys. You all set?

02:01.163 --> 02:03.996
Oh, yeah. Major undercover op.
This shift is gonna rock.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.656
Hanging on a little tight there, Dov.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.916
I don't think a john sweep
qualifies as an "op."

02:07.961 --> 02:09.371
Is it an operation? Yes, it is.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.127
Will we be dressed in uniform?
No, we will not.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.834
- We will be--
- Dressed as hookers.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.589
Yeah, I know it's no big deal to you.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.876
You're used to being dressed
like a hooker, but to me...

02:18.138 --> 02:20.720
Okay, whose cologne
is making my eyes water? (sniffs)

02:20.766 --> 02:25.055
J‘ I'd give it all again to feel it .l‘

02:26.438 --> 02:28.349
You guys are here... and here.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.555
Cover team is here.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.938
Backup here, here and here.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.021
You will not be wired,
but you will have earpieces

02:37.074 --> 02:39.736
so we can talk you through.
Peck, run the drill.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.868
Well, we need the john to offer money
for a sex-related act,

02:42.913 --> 02:45.029
and then he is arrestable,
so we give the signal,

02:45.082 --> 02:47.118
cover team moves in
and makes the collar.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.373
Good.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.660
Do not let anyone touch you.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.090
Do not get in any vehicle.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.839
Do not go anywhere
your cover team can't see you.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.716
And no matter what happens,
you stick to your story.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.378
You're drug addicts. You're supporting a habit.
It's nothing fancy.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.217
(Sam) All right.
You guys are the fresh faces.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.053
That's why you're out there,
so this one's all on you.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.434
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.271
(indistinct conversations)

03:11.316 --> 03:12.647
Too much?

03:12.943 --> 03:14.353
Uh, too little.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.649
(scoffs) Please. You're the one
who brought in the porno boots.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.938
(laughing) Would you shut up?
(knock on door)

03:18.990 --> 03:21.276
Nash, uh, got a request from the D's office.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.567
They want a rook to help
with a murder investigation.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.826
Murder, sir?

03:24.871 --> 03:28.614
Yeah. Kempton University student
got sliced up in High Park last night.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.079
Be a good opportunity to see
a homicide case close up.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.118
And you want me?

03:33.171 --> 03:36.254
O-or you, McNally.
Uh, you're welcome to opt out

03:36.299 --> 03:37.379
and work with Callaghan, if you want.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.089
Um... All yours.

03:41.138 --> 03:44.255
Right, then you should check in with Callaghan
and tell him to wait up.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.592
Wait up? Why? Where am I going?

03:45.642 --> 03:46.631
The morgue.

03:46.685 --> 03:47.925
Oh.

03:47.978 --> 03:51.186
- Um... here.
- Thanks.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.109
You, uh, always take this long
figuring out what to wear?

03:58.155 --> 04:00.612
(scoffs) You always hang around
women's locker rooms?

04:00.657 --> 04:01.817
Hey, you started it.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.449
(door squeaks)

04:05.495 --> 04:06.951
Oh, who's this?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.453
None of your business.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.454
Right. (clears throat)

04:11.334 --> 04:12.323
Magnetic, huh?

04:12.377 --> 04:13.617
That's cool. Good idea.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.750
Sir.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.955
- You're ready for this, right?
- For what?

04:18.008 --> 04:21.045
- Tonight.
- Yeah. Of course.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.297
Good.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.472
- I like the leopard print one.
- Oh, good.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.973
Good, 'cause I'm wearing the green one.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.099
Good.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.352
Just go wherever you want,
and you do that, eh? Go.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.488
ls--uh, is this the--
about the cologne?

04:40.530 --> 04:42.031
Uh...

04:42.866 --> 04:45.152
'cause |--| think there might be
some sort of confusion.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.320
Look, I'd do anything, sir.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.200
You know that.

04:51.541 --> 04:55.875
But if you want me to be a...
You know.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.663
Hey, what's to know? Diaz, you're a hustler
looking for some action.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.830
Yeah, but...

04:59.883 --> 05:01.669
(lowers voice)
but, like, a gay hustler?

05:01.718 --> 05:03.379
You got a problem with it?

05:03.428 --> 05:06.215
Well... no, it's just--

05:06.598 --> 05:09.055
Well, it'sjust I don't--
I don't think anyone's gonna buy it.

05:10.519 --> 05:11.508
You know...

05:11.561 --> 05:13.517
I'm actually very, very straight.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.349
Learn to bend.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.184
Uh,|bend.

05:17.234 --> 05:20.021
Not literally, but I would
if it meant bringing in the bad guys.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.435
Sorry, Epstein.
You're on the "N" case.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.561
The "N" case?

05:23.657 --> 05:26.114
Yeah, you sit in your squad,
on the radio.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.275
You pay attention
"n-case" we need you.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.693
(Noelle laughs)

05:29.746 --> 05:30.735
You know, Dov's right.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.030
He's actually much more believable
a-as a gay dude.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.448
- lt--it's true. | shave my chest.
- So...

05:34.501 --> 05:35.490
- (Frank) Hey, McNally.
- Yeah?

05:35.544 --> 05:37.080
Come here.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.743
- (Oliver) Hey.
- (Andy) Hey.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.539
Settle something.
Who's gonna make a better rentboy--

05:41.591 --> 05:42.797
Epstein or Diaz?

05:43.301 --> 05:46.088
Uh... Well, um... I'm not a guy, but--

05:46.137 --> 05:48.594
- Simple question, McNally.
- Yeah. Chris, definitely.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.005
(Oliver) Settled.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.470
All right, Epstein, you're backup.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.263
Diaz, you're the decoy boy.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.309
(Oliver) Work it.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.275
(Gail scoffs) Those boots are ridiculous.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.695
You know we're supposed to be
low-rent prostitutes, right?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.355
Yeah, well, they're not
exactly high-end.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.570
Who's gonna pay to have sex with you
looking like that?

06:09.619 --> 06:12.076
(scoffs) You'd be surprised.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.117
(Sam on radio)
All right. Can you hear me?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.617
Do you remember the signal?

06:20.630 --> 06:23.497
Good. Now we got backup
surrounding you, okay?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.335
Jay, can you hear me?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.000
(siren wailing in distance)

06:27.971 --> 06:30.804
Okay. Anything goes wrong,
we're here. Got it?

06:31.141 --> 06:33.006
(woman)
.l‘ l was dancing on my knees .l‘

06:34.895 --> 06:36.726
J‘ Looking like a prayer .l‘

06:38.148 --> 06:39.137
.l‘ Dancing on... J‘

06:39.190 --> 06:40.805
(Frank) Looking good, Diaz. (laughs)

06:40.859 --> 06:43.066
(Noelle) No kiddin'.
Check out his "mameltoe."

06:43.111 --> 06:45.773
(Noelle laughs)

06:45.822 --> 06:47.687
Uh, there's a lump in your pants, lady.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.902
(both laugh)

06:49.951 --> 06:51.532
Now that's just not nice.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.160
(Frank laughing) Now look-—
look at that stud. That's all man_

06:54.205 --> 06:56.992
(Noelle laughing) Oh, yeah.
Boys are gonna go crazy.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.955
lt's days like this I love myjob.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.414
Uh-huh, I hear ya.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.251
This?
Damn, I'd come in for free.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.761
What is he doing?

07:08.803 --> 07:11.294
Four stab wounds,
some obvious defense wounds.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.260
Looks like a 6- to 8-inch blade.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.765
Those always make a mess.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.311
Yes, sir.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.844
Only one weapon,

07:18.897 --> 07:21.058
no other marks or bruising,
so we're probablyjust looking for one guy.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.395
Um, it says here, "No |.D., no wallet."

07:24.444 --> 07:25.980
So... what? A mugging?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.940
Well, could be.
We'll know more once we ID. the body.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.152
Looks to be in his early 20s.
Student, probably.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.658
Wearing a Kempton Universityjacket--
Engineering Department.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.239
Good enough place to start.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.530
You okay?

07:40.543 --> 07:41.532
Yeah.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.249
Yeah, |--| think, uh, maybe it was
just the smell in the morgue.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.084
Just formaldehyde, blood.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.670
- It's funny. I don't even smell it anymore.
- Hmm.

07:49.719 --> 07:50.754
You wanna pin these up?

07:51.388 --> 07:52.548
Sure.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.090
J‘ Dancing on my knees, on my knees .l‘

07:58.228 --> 07:59.593
J‘ Looking like a prayer .l‘

08:01.439 --> 08:04.397

J‘ Dancing on my knees
and trying to reach... J‘

08:35.223 --> 08:39.717
Dispatch, 1505 still standing by,
corner of Gerrard and Pembroke.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.431
(woman on radio)
Uh, thank you once again, 1505.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.014
Still have your position.
Same as it was two minutes ago.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.891
Just making sure.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.102
(hangs up radio)

08:52.615 --> 08:53.604
(sighs)

09:01.833 --> 09:04.119
Dispatch, this is 1505 again.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.501
l'm witnessing a suspicious-looking male--

09:06.546 --> 09:09.253
Caucasian,
approximately 25 years of age.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.962
He appears to be
picking the lock of a residence.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.134
I'm gonna take a closer look.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.466
(woman on radio) 10-4.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.630
(siren wailing in distance)

09:18.683 --> 09:21.470
Oh, sorry. (laughs) Hey.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.636
Disregard. Disregard.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.678
False alarm.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.940
His key was just stuck.
Looks like he might actually live there.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.442
Unbelievable. Man, what is with that kid?

09:31.488 --> 09:32.568
(Dov on radio) Just trying to help.

09:32.614 --> 09:33.899
Tell me we were never that stupid.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.281
- Thank you.
- (man on radio) Let's clear this channel.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.784
(man) J‘ Money must be funny
in a rich man's world .l‘

09:39.829 --> 09:41.945
.l‘ I might crack a smile
when the bottle froze .l‘

09:41.998 --> 09:44.660
.l‘ It's still one for the money,
two for the show J‘

09:44.709 --> 09:46.950
For 50 bucks,
I'd do just about anything.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.127
- (Oliver on radio) Takedown.
- ("john") Come on. Get in the car.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.788
(Sam on radio) Peck, good work.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.297
All right, Jay. He's all yours, buddy.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.708
That sounds pretty good.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.839
(Jay) Good evening, sir.
I'm a police officer.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.675
- You understand me?
- No way.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.807
(woman)
.l‘ Your house was not a home .l‘

10:08.316 --> 10:10.181
(keystrokes, beep)

10:13.780 --> 10:14.769
(beep)

10:16.366 --> 10:17.355
(beep)
Any luck?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.658
Uh, gone through
the last four yearbooks.

10:20.703 --> 10:21.863
Nojoy.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.987
Maybe he was a part-time student.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.826
No one at the university
recognized his photo?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.035
Uh-uh.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.918
Not a single Engineering prof,
and no one in the Engineering Club.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.503
Time of death is about 11:30.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.086
He was probably taking a shortcut
through the park on his way home.

10:36.219 --> 10:39.586
Let's narrow it down to students with addresses
within a 4-block radius of the park.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.173
Meantime, why don't you organize
these autopsy photos

10:43.226 --> 10:44.432
so we can keep everything straight?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.718
I'm like a chef.
I like to clean as | go.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.432
- Sir.
- Mm?

10:49.691 --> 10:53.309
Please, l'd... I'd be happy
to work on the addresses.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.653
Anything.
Anything that doesn't involve more photos.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.438
Traci, you're a cop.
You're gonna see dead bodies.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.573
I know. lt's--it'sjust...

11:00.618 --> 11:01.653
Okay.

11:04.455 --> 11:07.367
You know, I've never seen this
as a particularly positive thing,

11:07.417 --> 11:09.703
but apparently men are more visual.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.583
Okay...

11:11.629 --> 11:14.587
Male investigators. We need more pictures
to put it all together.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.712
And what about women?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.089
They tend to focus more on the story.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.333
What does the evidence
say about the victim?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.920
Who was he? What happened?
What doesn't add up?

11:23.474 --> 11:25.430
Neither one's better, just different.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.137
McNally, you're being eyeballed again.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.102
Black pickup coming from the south.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.437
Third time around for him. Get ready.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.533
(whispers) Hey.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.747
Haven't seen you before.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.280
(normal voice)
Yeah, well, I'm new.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.996
Yeah, you're new. (scoffs)

11:53.713 --> 11:56.546
- I like dogs.
- What?

11:58.509 --> 11:59.965
I like dogs.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.920
Your face. (laughs)

12:03.973 --> 12:05.759
You're not my type. Get lost.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.675
Are you looking for somethin', honey?

12:10.647 --> 12:11.636
"Honey"?

12:15.109 --> 12:17.145
You're a dog. You don't even know it.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.816
Come here, little doggy.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.526
Daddy'll give you a treat.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.366
You afraid you can't take it?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.152
Get in.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.790
No, ljust...

12:29.832 --> 12:31.618
Got the signal. Jay, move in.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.249
- Get in.
- Yeah, |--

12:33.294 --> 12:35.956
- Not interested. Thanks.
- Not interested?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.711
- Disregard.
- (Sam on radio) McNally, what's going on?

12:37.757 --> 12:38.917
Bitch!

12:43.805 --> 12:46.922
White male eyeing you. Mid 40s.
Blue shirt. Beige slacks.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.846
Look alive, Diaz. He's coming over.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.140
Great. Awesome.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.024
ls $20 enough?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.605
Maybe. Maybe not.
What do you want?

13:00.655 --> 13:03.613
Somewhere more private, all right?
Back there, maybe.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.903
Diaz, what's going on?
Give me the signal.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.659
Well, how about $40? Or $60?
I'll give you whatever you want,

13:08.705 --> 13:09.865
just not out here in the open.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.246
What are you looking for? Specifically.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.873
My son.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.203
Look, he's only 17. ljust--

13:19.590 --> 13:21.091
I can't go home until I find him.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.091
Okay.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.131
Yeah, all right.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.718
- What--
- Not good.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.756
(scoffs)

13:30.810 --> 13:33.893
If he didn't communicate a price,
then why the hell did you signal?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.519
It was just a mistake.
The guy freaked me out.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.771
lt--it just threw me off.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.273
What?
You're not expecting Prince Charming?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.400
It won't happen again.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.728
You okay?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.863
- Yeah. Fine.
- Yeah?

13:49.037 --> 13:50.823
She hasn't made a bust yet, Sam.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.284
(door opens and closes)
She'll be fine.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.499
- Did you contact the police?
- Well, sure.

14:00.548 --> 14:04.132
And if he was 8 or 9,
maybe it'd make a difference, but Josh is 17.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.758
He's not a big priority for the cops.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.836
Uh, how do you know he was here?

14:07.889 --> 14:10.676
One of our neighbors thought he saw him
downtown a few days ago.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.218
He's got no money.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.725
ljust--
I figured, 'cause...

14:16.439 --> 14:17.519
Well, he's like you.

14:18.941 --> 14:19.976
What do you mean, like me?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.482
You know...

14:22.153 --> 14:23.142
queer

14:25.990 --> 14:27.571
You got a picture or somethin'?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.199
Yeah. Uh...

14:30.953 --> 14:34.241
We had a fight. (sighs)

14:34.290 --> 14:35.791
He told me he was gay,

14:36.959 --> 14:37.994
and I hit him.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.794
(sighs) I thought he was gonna
hit me back, but he didn't.

14:41.839 --> 14:42.828
He just...

14:42.882 --> 14:44.292
He just left.

14:45.093 --> 14:49.132
God, I'm... so sorry.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.384
You can tell him when you see him.

14:53.476 --> 14:54.807
I'll keep my eyes open, all right?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.097
Thank you.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.102
(siren wailing in distance)

14:59.148 --> 15:00.399
Thanks.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.521
(indistinct police radio chatter)

15:07.782 --> 15:11.024
Hey, my car.
Some chick's stealing my car.

15:11.494 --> 15:12.574
Yes.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.326
(starts engine)

15:14.372 --> 15:16.328
(siren whoops)

15:16.374 --> 15:20.538
Dispatch, this is 1505 again.
I got someone stealing a car.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.328
In pursuit of the vehicle.
Driver refuses to pull over.

15:23.381 --> 15:27.294
Marker is Alpha-Yankee-Yankee-Lima-8-0-5.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.208
Looks like-- No, wait.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.377
Car has stopped.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.048
(engine revs)
No--okay, it's not stopped. It's going.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.806
(tires screech, siren whoops)

15:36.853 --> 15:38.184
Suspect is not stopping.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.719
Continuing to pursue.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.554
Pursuing on foot.
(turns off siren)

15:41.607 --> 15:44.565
(engine sputtering, gears grinding)

15:44.610 --> 15:46.316
(woman on radio)
1523, are you free to assist?

15:46.362 --> 15:48.102
Ma'am, pull over!

15:48.990 --> 15:50.355
Out--out of the c--

15:50.408 --> 15:52.615
Uh, suspect is traveling
southbound on Pembroke.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.652
Ma'am! Stop the car right now.
Hey! That is it.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.742
Stop the car right now!
Stop the car right now.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.031
Roll down the window.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.038
(woman) 1505, please report.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.289
Sadie!

16:05.214 --> 16:06.750
(man on radio)
Epstein, are you 10-4?

16:08.885 --> 16:10.341
(vehicle approaching)

16:10.386 --> 16:11.375
(Andy) I got it. I got it.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.428
Hey, looking for a date?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.386
Careful, McNally. Don't overdo it.
Just let it happen.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.677
You a cop?
(scoffs) Yeah. I'm a cop.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.391
You figured me out. (laughs)

16:23.524 --> 16:24.900
Reach in. Grab my crotch.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.478
(laughs nervously)

16:27.320 --> 16:30.983
(laughs) Teeth out of a magazine.
No track marks.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.522
I think you're a cop.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.908
Well, you think wrong.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.911
If you're not a cop, get in the car.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.162
Andy, just give me the signal.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.199
l, uh, I can't.

16:42.585 --> 16:46.043
I knew it. You're a cop, huh?

16:46.088 --> 16:48.044
- No. N-n-no, I'm not--
- (loudly) Cop! She's a cop!

16:48.090 --> 16:50.046
(man on street) Hey, she's a cop.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.297
(groans)

16:53.346 --> 16:54.426
(indistinct shouting)

16:54.472 --> 16:56.258
(Andy whispers) What?
(Gail mouths word)

16:58.142 --> 16:59.222
I'm not.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.348
(man) They're the cops!

17:03.272 --> 17:06.230
He told me to grab his crotch.
What was I supposed to say?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.857
You wing it. You say, uh,
"We're not giving out freebies."

17:08.903 --> 17:09.892
We went over this.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.482
Okay, well, it's early,
so I'll just make it up.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.271
(Gail) No, it's pointless.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.313
(cell phone ringing)
- (Andy) Why?

17:14.450 --> 17:16.566
Because you practically
announced that you were a cop

17:16.619 --> 17:18.280
to every car that came near you.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.365
You know, we should do a unit move.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.325
There's still a lot of action
happening at Parkdale.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.912
Maybe we could get the girls
over there to beat it,

17:24.961 --> 17:26.451
but that's a serious pain in the ass.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.086
- Well, I'll move.
- (Sam) Not you. You're done.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.089
Epstein, I need you to take McNally
back with you to the barn.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.385
- (Dov) Roger that, sir.
- What?

17:33.427 --> 17:36.339
Oh, come on. I know what to expect now.
Just give me another chance.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.971
It's not up to me. That was Boyko.
He wants to see you. Now.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.769
What can I say, McNally?
I'm sorry.

17:48.818 --> 17:49.933
Maybe if you had my back earlier...

17:49.986 --> 17:53.649
I had a senior guy ask me an honest question.
I gave him an honest answer.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.030
(Sadie) Hey, hey! You know what, guys?
I wasn't hooking,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.191
and, uh, that guy lent me his car.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.609
You knew I wanted a chance out there.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.368
Working U.C. could have been my niche.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.621
- Diaz didn't even want to do it.
- How am I supposed to--

18:03.666 --> 18:06.578
O-okay. You know what? (laughs)
I was hooking. That's true.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.869
But I didn't steal anything!
I didn't steal anything. He lent it to me.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.629
- I certainly would've been better at it than you.
- Pfft.

18:12.675 --> 18:14.381
Man, Boyko is gonna flip.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.965
Yeah, it's really easy to stay out of trouble
when you're sitting in a car doing nothing.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.552
Okay. I'm sorry. I did steal it.
I did steal it,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.011
but you know what? He deserved it.

18:23.060 --> 18:27.429
Please, please. Okay?
I got things to offer, you know.

18:27.481 --> 18:31.941
Okay? |--| know guys
that are holding drugs and weapons.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.478
Okay? I g--l got great tips.
You know, I can make a deal.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.147
Oh, thank you, Sadie,
but unlike my colleague here,

18:38.200 --> 18:41.488
- I'm doing just fine without anybody's tips.
- Pfft.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.493
- You Epstein?
- Yes.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.154
Boyko wants to see you in his office.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.869
Now.
(door buzzes, beeps)

18:50.129 --> 18:52.085
No, | get it. Every rookie
screws up now and then,

18:52.131 --> 18:54.747
makes mistakes, but this...

18:55.134 --> 18:58.297
McNally, your training officer told me
you were ready for this.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.211
I guess I should have him in here instead?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.004
No, no. I screwed up.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.548
Well, you weren't the only one.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.842
Isn't that right, officer?

19:05.895 --> 19:07.180
Sir?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.641
When you were yakking nonstop
over the air,

19:09.690 --> 19:13.524
Dispatch was trying
to send cars out to a 911

19:13.569 --> 19:15.230
for a multi-vehicle accident.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.733
You guys were assigned to 15

19:17.782 --> 19:20.444
because we were told
you're the best rookies in the city,

19:20.493 --> 19:23.576
but, you know, right now
I am just not seeing that.

19:23.621 --> 19:24.736
I mean, are you?

19:25.581 --> 19:26.696
(both) No, sir.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.206
Probation doesn't just mean
"don't screw up."

19:29.251 --> 19:31.742
It also means "surprise me."

19:32.088 --> 19:33.203
Impress me.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.420
Show a little initiative.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.091
Just go.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.723
Those boots are really something.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.231
(snickers) Yeah, well,
they look better than they feel.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.732
Thought you were working
the street tonight?

19:55.778 --> 19:56.893
(sighs) l was,

19:56.946 --> 19:59.403
but a john called me out, and l froze.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.608
I burned a whole corner.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.614
Boyko is seriously disappointed.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.441
No.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.115
God, lam, like,
the worst liar in the world.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.324
ljust--| don't know
how to do it.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.287
You ever heard the saying,
"Show me a man's flaw,

20:12.336 --> 20:14.167
and I will show you
the kernel of his brilliance"?

20:15.756 --> 20:17.621
So my brilliance is that I'm a terrible liar?

20:18.342 --> 20:21.129
Andy, you can't think of it that way, all right?
You're not a bad liar.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.588
- You're an--
- Idiot?

20:22.638 --> 20:24.174
Honest person.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.552
You have an open face, straight up.
You know how to listen.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.977
Just reframe it.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.438
Use all that stuff
to your advantage. Don't...

20:31.772 --> 20:34.149
Don't think of it as a weakness.
Play to your strengths.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.812
Here.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.772
I've already had too many.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.817
Who are you?

20:43.993 --> 20:45.654
You perfect or something, huh?

20:45.953 --> 20:47.159
Is that your flaw?

20:49.999 --> 20:51.660
More important question--

20:51.709 --> 20:53.791
How you gonna make it up to Boyko?

20:58.215 --> 20:59.671
(door beeps)

20:59.717 --> 21:00.832
(whispers) Dov.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.133
Hey, you process her yet?

21:03.179 --> 21:05.010
- Just getting started. Why?
- Come here.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.965
Okay, we screwed up tonight, right?

21:09.018 --> 21:10.849
Where does that leave us?
I mean, what've we even got?

21:10.895 --> 21:13.853
Uh, we've got Boyko on our ass,
you've got sore feet...

21:13.898 --> 21:16.184
and we've got a girl who stole a car
in the lamest possible way.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.849
Or we have an informant
who claims to have a decent tip.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.729
Look, Boyko wants us to show initiative.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.280
Maybe we deal her out for a bigger tip.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.527
Sadie.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.535
Earlier you mentioned
you might have a good tip.

21:34.877 --> 21:35.912
How good we talking?

21:38.214 --> 21:40.830
So this guy has illegal guns?
How many?

21:40.925 --> 21:43.291
She says she's seen
at least five, maybe ten,

21:43.385 --> 21:44.841
and he told her they were unregistered.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.173
Okay. That could be
considered trafficking.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.841
Look, if it pans out, I'd say, yeah,
it's worth making the deal.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.508
(cell phone rings)

21:52.561 --> 21:55.519
Oh, great. (clears throat)
Can you hold?

21:56.065 --> 21:58.181
Uh, who's your witness?
She reliable?

21:58.234 --> 21:59.815
Uh... l don't--| don't--

21:59.860 --> 22:04.024
Guys, you need a reliable source
if you're gonna get a warrant.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.733
What if she's got proof?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.648
Witness has got proof,
you're good to go.

22:07.701 --> 22:08.861
(beep)

22:08.911 --> 22:10.367
Yeah, go for Jerry.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.572
Uh-huh.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.534
Sorry. Goodbye.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.914
No, n-not you.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.789
This is gonna be great, right?

22:19.255 --> 22:21.541
Yeah, are you kidding me?
If Sadie's tip pans out,

22:21.590 --> 22:23.376
we dig ourselves right out of this hole.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.631
Okay. And if it doesn't?

22:24.677 --> 22:27.464
Well, she goes right back to booking.
No harm, no foul.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.504
(unzips boot)
Okay, I don't want to do anything stupid tonight.

22:29.557 --> 22:30.672
I've done enough damage.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.885
It's not stupid.
lt's taking initiative.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.015
(unzips boot)

22:34.061 --> 22:36.552
Besides, Boyko said if we don't prove
we deserve to be here,

22:36.605 --> 22:37.594
we're not gonna be.

22:37.648 --> 22:38.763
Yeah, you're right.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.898
Simple, all right?
We check it out. No big deal.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.400
- Serve, protect...
- Save our own asses.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.605
Let's do it to it.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.986
(dog barking in distance)

22:54.290 --> 22:56.576
(Sadie) I'm telling you, that guy's got
at least five guns in there,

22:56.625 --> 22:57.614
maybe more. I've seen them.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.909
(Andy) Yeah, well, we can't go in there,
not without grounds.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.953
Look, I thought we were gonna be
able to get a little closer.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.086
You know, maybe see in.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.965
Okay, well, I'm saying they're in there.
What else do you need?

23:06.010 --> 23:08.296
Uh, proof. Maybe that way
we could get a warrant.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.961
Come on, Sadie.
You're not the most reliable source.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.927
What if they moved the guns?
What if they're gone?

23:13.976 --> 23:15.466
Okay.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.931
Okay, you want me to go in
and make sure?

23:17.980 --> 23:19.641
- No.
- 'Cause |--| can.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.100
I'll be in and out in five minutes.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.606
No way. It's too risky.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.313
Come on. I know this guy.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.648
I mean, every Saturday's
a party night with him.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.654
Right now he's gonna be
with one of the new girls

23:29.700 --> 23:31.986
in some cheap-ass room
at a motor lodge.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.367
You know, he's not gonna
be back till morning.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.401
Sadie.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.491
Look, | just got off probation, okay?

23:37.207 --> 23:40.074
If I go back tojail again, it's over.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.084
Please.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.870
You guys need this.

23:45.841 --> 23:46.830
I need this.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.796
We need proof the guns
are in there, like a picture.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.131
- You have a cell phone?
- I got a pager.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.296
They still make those?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.556
Fine. Take this.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.058
In and out in five minutes.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.269
All right, no sweat.
Thank you, guys.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.270
I'll be back in five. Okay.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.524
My stomach is churning.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.279
That's called "the thrill of the job."

24:30.344 --> 24:32.630
What about the newspapers
under his clothes?

24:33.389 --> 24:34.424
What about 'em?

24:34.765 --> 24:36.471
Well, if he had them stuffed
under his clothes,

24:36.517 --> 24:38.053
they must have been
important to him.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.553
Under his clothes, I don't think
he was reading the paper.

24:42.690 --> 24:43.679
lnsulation.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.353
He was using them to keep warm.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.233
I already contacted the university

24:48.278 --> 24:50.940
to see if any of the engineering students
were having financial difficulties.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.071
Poor kid was probably homeless.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.824
He wasn't homeless long.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.236
He was wearing $200 jeans.
He had brand-new shoes.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.076
The only thing old that he was wearing
was his jacket.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.710
How do you know his jacket's old?

25:03.752 --> 25:06.129
Creases in the arms,
a few moth holes,

25:06.171 --> 25:07.707
and it was big.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.463
If it was new,
you'd think it would at least fit him.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.924
Could be his dad's or his brother's.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.087
Well, he's probably not even a student.
We're barking up the wrong tree.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.217
(sighs) That would explain
why nobody at the university

25:22.271 --> 25:23.556
recognized his photo,

25:23.939 --> 25:25.520
'cause he's not even a student.

25:26.316 --> 25:27.567
(Andy) She's been in there way too long.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.940
(Dov) Maybe she can't find the guns.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.271
Or maybe there are no guns.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.443
Maybe she just bailed
and walked out the back door

25:32.489 --> 25:33.899
and is stealing another car.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.540
- Oh, my God.
- Ow.

25:55.471 --> 25:56.460
(engine turns off)

26:01.643 --> 26:02.632
Let's hope she did bail.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.972
- What if she's still in there?
- I don't know.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.106
- I'm going in.
- No, no! On what cause?

26:10.152 --> 26:12.768
I don't know. I'll make up
a noise complaint or something.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.437
Augh. That's not really gonna fly, okay?
Who's gonna make a noise complaint right now?

26:15.491 --> 26:17.447
There's nobody else
within a mile of this place.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.073
- Okay, I'll go in.
- No way.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.623
Yeah. I'm not even in uniform, okay?

26:23.665 --> 26:25.405
I'm just gonna go in there.
I'll take a look around.

26:25.459 --> 26:28.496
It's no big deal.
l'll just--|'|| wing it.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.456
(clatter)
(quietly) Ow.

26:30.506 --> 26:31.495
Wing it?

26:33.008 --> 26:36.000
(hip-hop music playing)

26:45.187 --> 26:46.677
(knocks on door)

26:46.730 --> 26:48.812
Hey, sorry to bother you guys.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.643
Um, crappy car, okay?

26:50.692 --> 26:53.434
Super crappy,
and it's sputtering all the time,

26:53.487 --> 26:57.071
backfires, and it actually stalls
every time I try to pick up speed.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.824
Anyway, the point is--
is that it's stalled out there,

27:00.869 --> 27:02.655
and I kind of have no idea what to do.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.832
Probably the fuel filter
or maybe the pump.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.581
No, no. If it was the pump,
it wouldn't start at all.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.243
Oh. Okay, so then
it's probably the filter.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.957
Yeah, I guess.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.463
Great. Um, can I get one?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.260
Sorry, lady. The place is closed.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.214
Oh, come on. Guys, I...

27:20.722 --> 27:22.303
l'm--l'm a little desperate here, okay?

27:22.349 --> 27:24.761
Do you think that maybe I could
at least use the phone?

27:25.561 --> 27:27.426
It's just that my car is practically
in the middle of the road,

27:27.479 --> 27:29.185
and I don't want the cops taking it.

27:29.731 --> 27:34.270
I guess I could sit on the steps
until, you know, I get a tow truck.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.935
Pete, just grab her a filter.
I'll meet you around back.

27:36.989 --> 27:42.029
Really? Thank you so much.
I really... You're awesome.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.568
- Wait here. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.752
(man) Trevor McKenzie.

27:54.756 --> 27:58.248
Uh, business number
416-555-...

27:58.302 --> 27:59.291
(door beeps)

28:02.848 --> 28:05.510
Pretty impressive.
You really racked 'em up tonight.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.550
Please, folks,
|--| didn't do anything, okay?

28:07.603 --> 28:08.592
I didn't even touch him.

28:08.645 --> 28:11.637
No, but you did offer 10 bucks
for me to touch you.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.889
- 10 bucks?
- Mm.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.433
Really sold yourself short there, Diaz.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.192
Have a little pride.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.401
(door buzzes, beeps)

28:25.329 --> 28:26.364
You seen this kid?

28:26.622 --> 28:28.783
- No.
- Hmm? Anyone?

28:30.459 --> 28:33.622
Okay. Well, if any one of you
came across him tonight,

28:34.963 --> 28:39.127
you'd be doing yourself a real favor
if you could tell me what you know.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.849
(whispers) Sadie!
What are you doing?

28:49.895 --> 28:51.851
I told you to wait back there.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.182
(man) What's she doing here?

29:00.322 --> 29:01.311
You?

29:03.992 --> 29:04.981
I know you.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.865
Yeah, you're that whore
that blew me off.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.154
Her car broke down.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.497
Yeah. Um, lwasjust driving home, and--

29:12.542 --> 29:14.043
You let her in?

29:14.544 --> 29:16.535
You better start unloading,
you want to get it done.

29:18.674 --> 29:19.663
You know--

29:20.842 --> 29:22.707
We're just--we're gonna leave.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.126
So...

29:24.513 --> 29:26.003
You know the snake.

29:26.056 --> 29:28.513
Look, Dean, we're just working together.

29:28.558 --> 29:31.800
I went looking for my snake.
No snake.

29:31.853 --> 29:34.344
Tried to get me a dog.

29:34.398 --> 29:37.890
Well, the dog took off.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.150
I come back here, mm,

29:40.195 --> 29:43.358
all by myself, sad and lonely.

29:43.407 --> 29:46.444
Knock, knock, knock.
Guess who's at my door?

29:46.493 --> 29:48.324
Yeah. We were really
looking for car parts.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.826
No. Don't lie.

29:54.584 --> 29:57.747
Looks like my Saturday night
just turned around.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.557
There you go, honey.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.437
- Get undressed.
- I don't give away freebies.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.863
Free? Just gave you a beer.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.362
Yeah. Take a hell of a lot more than that.
I can tell you that much.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.148
Ahh.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.401
You're like the snake.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.485
(sets down bottle)

30:33.999 --> 30:35.364
Need to get flattened first?

30:36.418 --> 30:37.658
Okay.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.753
- What does that mean?
- It means you want the hard stuff.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.089
Sadie, what happened?

30:52.142 --> 30:53.632
(voice breaking)
Get me out of here now!

30:53.685 --> 30:56.301
- What happened?
- I don't know.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.595
He was here. I couldn't find the guns.
I didn't know what to do.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.226
What am I supposed to do?
The guy's a psycho! Please!

31:00.275 --> 31:01.435
All right, fine, whatever.
Just give me the phone.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.232
Okay. Tell him you're a cop.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.519
Yeah, I can't tell him I'm a cop.
I don't have my gun on me.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.937
- Oh, God!
- I'm calling Dov.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.697
Hey! Stop! Gimme that.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.113
Gimme that.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.242
(cell phone smashes)

31:17.084 --> 31:18.915
(velcro rips)

31:21.630 --> 31:23.211
(speed-dial beeps)

31:23.256 --> 31:24.632
(ringing)

31:24.841 --> 31:28.254
Hey, this is Andy.
Leave a message. (beep)

31:32.432 --> 31:33.467
Get on all fours.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.058
(Sadie whimpers)

31:38.980 --> 31:41.813
I said get on your hands and knees.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.939
I'm gonna poke holes in both of you.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.073
Dean, you don't get who she is.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.154
Sadie, stop.

31:53.203 --> 31:54.192
Dean...

31:56.123 --> 31:57.112
Spit it out, snake.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.871
- She--
- Okay, just...

31:58.917 --> 32:00.453
The truth is...

32:02.462 --> 32:04.794
l'm not--l'm not really a hooker, okay?

32:04.840 --> 32:06.296
l was just trying something new tonight,

32:06.341 --> 32:08.798
and it turns out I'm really bad at it.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.630
That's--that's it.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.758
(crying)

32:13.807 --> 32:16.890
- She's a--she's a...
- Sadie. Sadie.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.434
- Speak.
- (whimpers)

32:19.479 --> 32:20.468
Speak.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.022
Dean, she's a cop.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.523
Ohh.

32:25.569 --> 32:27.400
And I'm sorry.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.078
- (Sadie crying)
- Look at me! What are you thinking?!

32:39.124 --> 32:40.830
You stupid...

32:41.460 --> 32:42.745
bitch!

32:42.794 --> 32:44.500
Yeah, bringing a cop in here?

32:44.546 --> 32:45.911
Just leave her alone.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.548
That why you wouldn't
get in my car tonight?

32:50.051 --> 32:51.040
What are you looking for?

32:51.094 --> 32:52.595
Nothing. I just came back for Sadie.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.673
- You watching me? That it?
- No.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.505
- Turn around.
- Just let us go right now.

32:56.558 --> 32:57.673
Turn...around!

32:57.726 --> 32:59.808
- Snake, get over there.
- (whimpering) Okay.

32:59.853 --> 33:00.842
Turn around.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.271
Unh! Listen, Sadie's just scared, okay?

33:12.324 --> 33:13.359
She doesn't know what she's talking about,

33:13.408 --> 33:15.490
'cause if I was really a cop,
I would have a badge and a gun,

33:15.535 --> 33:17.366
and l don't--| don't have either.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.868
Unless...

33:18.914 --> 33:20.370
- Oh!
- You wearing a wire?

33:20.415 --> 33:21.621
- No. Please don't.
- Huh?

33:22.959 --> 33:25.211
Yeah. No wire.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.164
Hey!

33:27.839 --> 33:29.079
Anyone else in here?

33:29.132 --> 33:31.464
No. There's nobody. I swear.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.252
There's nobody else but us, okay?
There's nobody else.

33:34.304 --> 33:35.384
Good.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.182
Okay. Okay.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.722
(man speaking, indistinct)

33:46.775 --> 33:48.015
(second man) Check.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.648
Check.

33:49.736 --> 33:50.816
(first man continues, indistinct)

33:50.862 --> 33:52.477
Yeah, Tec-9.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.771
Check.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.566
Police, don't move!
Hands up now!

33:57.619 --> 33:59.450
In the air where I can see 'em!

34:05.293 --> 34:07.579
You ought to think about this, okay?
You don't want to do this.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.119
What? Shoot a couple of whores?

34:09.172 --> 34:12.585
- She's not a whore. She's a cop.
- Really?

34:12.634 --> 34:16.843
'Cause I don't see a uniform.
No badge. No gun.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.096
All | see is a piece of strange
trespassing on my property.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.757
I got no option but to shoot.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.769
Okay, whatever you do to me,
just let Sadie go first.

34:25.814 --> 34:27.600
It's a shame about you, honey.

34:28.650 --> 34:29.685
Ohh!
(Gun fires)

34:31.820 --> 34:36.154
Dispatch, 1505. Shots fired.
Please send backup. 1745 Eastern.

34:43.832 --> 34:44.992
Don't move!

34:45.875 --> 34:47.285
Put the gun down.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.077
Now!

34:50.714 --> 34:51.749
(gun clatters)
- Get off me.

34:51.798 --> 34:53.004
(gasping)

34:55.719 --> 34:56.799
Face the car.

34:57.554 --> 34:58.543
Hands on the hood.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.842
What kind of cops are you?!

35:02.517 --> 35:04.974
You should've never let me in here!

35:05.020 --> 35:07.227
(crying)

35:11.735 --> 35:13.600
(indistinct police radio chatter)

35:17.282 --> 35:19.273
(siren wails)

35:20.410 --> 35:22.196
- Waiting for Swarek?
- Yeah.

35:22.871 --> 35:26.204
Matthew, do you want to look after,
uh, Sadie, please? Thank you.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.239
Sir.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.455
Congratulations, Epstein.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.291
Those guys you cuffed upstairs,
quick guesstimate,

35:34.341 --> 35:37.048
I'd say they were unloading at least,
uh, 40 unregistered weapons.

35:37.719 --> 35:39.050
Someone's making the news.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.837
Let's just hope they leave out
the part where, uh,

35:41.890 --> 35:43.130
two rookies from 15

35:43.183 --> 35:45.549
put a civilian's life in danger
to make the bust.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.177
- Sir, we thought it was--
- Sadie said it was safe.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.435
Of course she said it was safe.

35:49.939 --> 35:52.021
The girl would have said anything
not to go back to jail.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.557
The thing is, it's yourjob

35:53.610 --> 35:56.602
to know why people are saying
what they're saying.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.567
You want to be a cop,
learn to read the signs.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.025
The two of you
put a desperate woman's life in danger

36:03.078 --> 36:04.568
to make yourselves look good.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.745
And you nearly got yourself killed
in the process.

36:07.791 --> 36:08.906
Nice work.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.414
Hey, guys.

36:14.631 --> 36:17.293
- These two did good, sir.
- So I hear.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.958
Between the two of you,
almost two dozen arrests.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.878
Thank you.
It was a really rewarding experience.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.595
Oh, come on.
Was it really that painful?

36:28.645 --> 36:30.601
(chuckles)

36:31.106 --> 36:32.846
You smell good.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.566
We thought there might have been
five or six illegal weapons,

36:40.615 --> 36:43.277
but as soon as I stepped
into that building,

36:43.660 --> 36:44.740
I could smell there were more.

36:44.786 --> 36:49.280
I mean, I was operating on instinct--
pure, raw instinct. It was...

36:50.250 --> 36:53.037
Yeah, okay, mom.
Um, I gotta go.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.129
I'm sorry I woke you.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.287
I love you, too. Bye.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.258
(beep, flips cell phone shut)

37:00.301 --> 37:02.087
Huh. Long night, huh?

37:02.137 --> 37:04.173
Yeah, yeah.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.632
Turned out all right.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.761
I don't get it. (chuckles)

37:10.228 --> 37:11.843
Really, I don't, Epstein.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.603
You're, um, a smart guy, right?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.765
You're, uh, probably could
have gone to law school

37:16.818 --> 37:18.433
or be working finance.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.812
You're playing the funny guy.

37:23.658 --> 37:24.864
Why are you here?

37:25.952 --> 37:27.533
This is all I've ever wanted to do.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.115
Okay.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.120
So...

37:31.166 --> 37:33.782
then why don't you quit playing this
like it's a game,

37:34.669 --> 37:36.125
like it's something
that you can win?

37:36.171 --> 37:39.880
Okay, 'cause you--
you are smart, and you're fast.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.836
And--and you think outside the box,
and those are all really good things.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.502
So maybe you just...

37:46.681 --> 37:48.546
You slow it down a bit, and, uh,

37:48.975 --> 37:50.806
and you--and--and you be that for a while.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.348
(closes locker)
Night.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.947
(Chris) Hey.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.699
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

38:09.788 --> 38:11.870
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.534
Oh, man.
My bed is gonna feel so good.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.916
- Yeah. It was a long night.
- No kidding.

38:17.587 --> 38:19.578
Well, uh, well, have a good sleep.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.246
- You, too.
- Huh.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.625
(indistinct police radio chatter)

39:07.095 --> 39:11.088
(somber music plays)

39:20.316 --> 39:21.852
Darren.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.865
(music, no dialogue audio)

39:56.144 --> 39:57.304
(Sam) Hey.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.477
Need a ride?

39:59.522 --> 40:02.264
No, thanks.
Actually, I'm just gonna walk.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.399
Sorry about tonight.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.150
You'll get better.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.856
Ha. Sure, lwill.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.443
Look, it's myjob, all right?

40:10.491 --> 40:12.527
Something happens to you, it's on me.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.784
It's okay, sir. I completely get it.

40:14.829 --> 40:17.070
All right. I don't want anything
to happen to you.

40:27.675 --> 40:32.544

.l‘ Maybe we'll come back someday .l‘

40:32.597 --> 40:36.181
.l‘ To see how we've grown J‘

40:36.225 --> 40:38.386
(Luke) You want to buy
the house now, don't you?

40:39.062 --> 40:41.678
Maybe. It's got great windows.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.854
Lots of light, lots of room.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.687
The bloodstain on the floor
can be part of a mosaic.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.977
Hey, I thought we were trying
to play to its strengths.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.146
What are you doing here?

40:51.699 --> 40:53.030
Waiting for you.

40:54.035 --> 40:55.195
I hear you had a long night.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.609
Yeah.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.494
And I guess you don't need
another coffee.

40:58.539 --> 41:00.621
(gasps) Yes, I do.
This one's cold.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.372
Thank you.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.121
Mmm. Lots of milk,
no sugar, extra hot.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.539
You really are perfect.

41:09.592 --> 41:12.834
(chuckles) No, I'm really not.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.299
Mm. | just love that you remember.
