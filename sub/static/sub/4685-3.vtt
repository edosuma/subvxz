does like me,

05:44.303 --> 05:47.598
I'm not going to date him.

05:47.723 --> 05:48.913

never to date someone

your heart broken

05:50.226 --> 05:53.145
by a rodeo clown?

05:54.939 --> 05:56.023
Actually, yes.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.943
- I was referring
- to last summer,

05:59.068 --> 06:01.445
When I was working at

06:01.446 --> 06:03.822
Senor Cluck's Chickateria.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.846
Everything was just fine

06:05.847 --> 06:07.743
until I broke up with the

06:03.948 --> 06:07.743
assistant manager, Buck Cluck.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.726
That's when he assigned me

06:11.727 --> 06:13.874
to the plucking pit.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.960
- You had to pluck
- chicken eyebrows?

06:18.003 --> 06:19.130
No.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.905
I spent the rest of the summer

06:22.906 --> 06:24.635
knee-deep in beaks, claws,

06:21.173 --> 06:24.635
and chicken guts.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.638
Which, by the way,

06:27.639 --> 06:28.806
was our 99 cent combo.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.174
O-M-G!

06:42.175 --> 06:43.487
Tony's in the lobby!

06:43.570 --> 06:44.781
F-Y-I.

06:44.782 --> 06:45.990
That's his job!

06:47.241 --> 06:49.743
Wait! Wait!

06:49.868 --> 06:51.016
There's a chart in here

06:51.017 --> 06:52.163
to show how much

06:49.868 --> 06:52.163
a boy likes you.

06:52.288 --> 06:54.895
Another way to tell is if

06:54.896 --> 06:57.501
he gives you his toy from

06:52.288 --> 06:57.501
his extra value meal.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.024
It says in here

06:59.025 --> 07:00.504
if he touches you from

06:57.542 --> 07:00.504
shoulder to elbow,

07:00.629 --> 07:02.214
- you're in
- the friend zone.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.759
Elbow to wrist,

07:03.760 --> 07:05.176
the transitional zone.

07:05.301 --> 07:06.448
And wrist to fingertips

07:06.449 --> 07:07.594
means he's about to

07:05.301 --> 07:07.594
hold your hand,

07:07.719 --> 07:08.992
which is

07:08.993 --> 07:10.264
the romance zone!

07:10.389 --> 07:12.308
- As long as he - doesn't touch
- My end zone.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.062
Yo, Jessie!

07:17.188 --> 07:18.814
- Check out the addition
- to my uniform.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.649
I got epaulets!

07:23.402 --> 07:25.196

surefire sign number four

07:25.321 --> 07:28.615
that he's crushing on you.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.369
- I wouldn't call
- that an upgrade.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.455
- He looks like he's
- guarding the Wizard of Oz.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.581
- So, what do you
- got there?

07:36.707 --> 07:37.917
We're organizing

07:39.251 --> 07:41.586
Again.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.234
We got shoe boxes,

07:43.235 --> 07:44.756
sweater boxes, hat boxes,

07:41.712 --> 07:44.756
jewelry boxes,

07:44.882 --> 07:46.217
- and a box
- for my socks.

Thank you.

08:04.402 --> 08:05.569
Did you see that?

08:05.652 --> 08:06.933
- He went right
- for your hands!

08:07.029 --> 08:08.197
He skipped two zones!

08:08.198 --> 08:09.365
He's a zone skipper!

08:09.573 --> 08:10.824
Oh, my gosh!

08:11.616 --> 08:12.868
Emma, relax.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.140
It's not like

08:14.141 --> 08:15.287
he's asking me out

08:12.993 --> 08:15.287
or anything.

08:15.413 --> 08:16.622
Hey, Jessie,

08:16.623 --> 08:17.831
wanna have lunch in

08:15.413 --> 08:17.831
the park tomorrow?

08:18.832 --> 08:19.833
Well...

08:19.834 --> 08:20.834
She'd love to!

08:20.959 --> 08:22.086
Right, Jessie?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.588
I would love to,

08:24.671 --> 08:26.299
but I can't miss

08:26.300 --> 08:27.925
hanger day.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.095
You're excused.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.179
Awesome.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.847
- See you tomorrow.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.813
I'm thinking of

08:39.813 --> 08:41.438
a lobby-themed wedding.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.065
- What are
- you thinking?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.191
You don't want

08:44.192 --> 08:45.192
to know what I'm

08:43.190 --> 08:45.192
thinking.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.494
Jessie! You're gonna

08:54.495 --> 08:56.287
be late for your date

08:52.699 --> 08:56.287
with Tony!

08:57.329 --> 08:59.623
So, how do I look?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.127
Like Cinderella...

09:11.718 --> 09:12.865
and then he'll

09:12.866 --> 09:14.012
never ask me for

09:11.718 --> 09:14.012
another date.

09:14.138 --> 09:15.660
Look, Jessie,

09:15.661 --> 09:17.182
no matter how badly

09:14.138 --> 09:17.182
you dress,

09:17.308 --> 09:18.725
- or how dorky
- your hair looks...

09:18.850 --> 09:20.211
- My hair always
- looks like this.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.188
Oops.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.066
Tony's still going

09:26.067 --> 09:27.067
to try to kiss you.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.735
- And then you'll
- start dating...

09:28.860 --> 09:30.404
And knowing my history,

09:30.405 --> 09:31.947
we'll have a hideous breakup,

09:32.072 --> 09:33.841
- and I'll have to walk up
- 30 flights of stairs

09:33.865 --> 09:35.666
- So I don't have to pass
- Tony in the lobby!

09:37.744 --> 09:38.975
So you don't like

09:38.976 --> 09:40.205
Tony at all?

09:40.331 --> 09:41.395
Have you seen

09:41.396 --> 09:42.458
his new epaulets?

09:44.168 --> 09:46.044
- Yes, Zuri,
- and they're lovely,

09:46.170 --> 09:47.359
But I'm not getting

09:47.360 --> 09:48.547
involved with him.

09:48.672 --> 09:49.694
Or his sparkling

09:49.695 --> 09:50.715
blue eyes,

09:51.883 --> 09:52.906
or those

09:52.907 --> 09:53.927

just happened to me!

I was in the park

16:59.269 --> 17:01.145
- why did you invite
- me out to the park?

new in town and you

17:01.271 --> 17:04.107
don't have any friends.

clothes, okay?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.597
Luke!

18:18.598 --> 18:20.934
Here is your GameBuddy.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.936
- It's all right, man.
- You can keep it.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.688
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.002
I mean, after all,

18:26.003 --> 18:27.190
you helped me out

18:24.813 --> 18:27.190
with my karma problem

18:27.273 --> 18:28.984
- even though
- I pranked you.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.735
- You're a really
- good brother.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.309
Ravi, what have you

18:41.310 --> 18:42.831
been up to?

18:42.956 --> 18:44.248
Nothing.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.169
Stop!

18:48.170 --> 18:49.754
Your eyes bore

18:46.584 --> 18:49.754
into my soul

18:49.880 --> 18:51.319
like the merciless gaze

18:51.320 --> 18:52.757
of all-knowing Kali!

18:55.760 --> 18:57.554
- I've been working
- on that look.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.306
Now spill!

19:01.558 --> 19:03.226
Okay.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.353
Luke played a bunch

19:04.354 --> 19:05.395
of mean tricks on me

19:03.309 --> 19:05.395
so I got him back

19:05.520 --> 19:06.521
by telling him

19:06.522 --> 19:07.522
unless he cleaned up

19:05.520 --> 19:07.522
his karma,

19:07.647 --> 19:08.732
the universe would

19:08.733 --> 19:09.816
give him a total

19:07.647 --> 19:09.816
smackdown.

19:11.568 --> 19:12.610
And did it?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.071
Oh, yes,

19:14.072 --> 19:15.405
with a little help

19:12.736 --> 19:15.405
from me!

19:15.530 --> 19:17.178
I sprinkled high

19:17.179 --> 19:18.825
fiber bread crumbs

19:15.530 --> 19:18.825
on the terrace

19:18.950 --> 19:20.244
so the pigeons

19:20.245 --> 19:21.536
would poop on him,

19:21.661 --> 19:22.829
and then,

19:22.830 --> 19:23.997
I smeared peanut butter

19:21.661 --> 19:23.997
on his clothes

19:24.122 --> 19:25.290
so the squirrels

19:25.291 --> 19:26.457
would attack him.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.794
I can be quite impish.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.935
- But how did you know
- it was gonna rain?

19:34.007 --> 19:37.510
Oh, that really was karma.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.512
- You think
- I make this stuff up?

19:42.265 --> 19:43.454
Look, Ravi,

19:43.455 --> 19:44.642
in the future,

19:44.768 --> 19:46.228
if you have trouble with

19:46.229 --> 19:47.687
your brothers and sisters,

19:44.768 --> 19:47.687
just come to me.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.065
And you will

19:50.066 --> 19:52.316
come down on them

19:47.812 --> 19:52.316
like the rains of Ranchipur?

19:52.442 --> 19:54.945
Or we'll talk through it

19:54.946 --> 19:57.447
and work it through

19:52.442 --> 19:57.447
together as a family.

19:57.572 --> 19:58.823
Promise?

19:58.949 --> 20:00.117
Promise.

20:00.118 --> 20:01.284
Good.

20:01.409 --> 20:02.849
That said, peanut

20:02.850 --> 20:04.287
butter in the pants?

20:01.409 --> 20:04.287
Well played!

20:05.789 --> 20:07.124
- What!
- What!

20:09.417 --> 20:11.044
So, how'd your

20:11.045 --> 20:12.670
date with Tony go?

20:12.796 --> 20:14.048
I think I

20:14.049 --> 20:15.298
smell romance.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.634
That's sauerkraut.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.241
There is no romance

20:20.242 --> 20:21.471
with Tony.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.932
And there never will be.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.080
I can't believe

20:25.081 --> 20:26.101
Leopard Beat

20:24.057 --> 20:26.101
was wrong.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.352
I'm never reading again.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.815
- That's what
- you've learned?

20:38.529 --> 20:39.948
Oh, hello, Taylor!

20:40.865 --> 20:42.200
Off, on.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.369
Off, on.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.726
Off, on.

20:46.727 --> 20:47.956
Off...

20:48.081 --> 20:50.292
So, the whole day,

20:50.293 --> 20:52.502
I was just trying to

20:48.081 --> 20:52.502
be friends, you know?

20:52.627 --> 20:54.775
But then Jessie looked

20:54.776 --> 20:56.923
so pretty with the raindrops

20:52.627 --> 20:56.923
in her hair,

20:57.048 --> 20:58.363
I went in for a kiss,

20:58.364 --> 20:59.676
and then, bam!

20:59.801 --> 21:03.096
She pepper sprayed me!

21:03.221 --> 21:04.410
I tried to play it off

21:04.411 --> 21:05.598
like I was just reaching

21:03.221 --> 21:05.598
for my jacket,

21:05.723 --> 21:07.600
- but it was
- really awkward.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.353
- So what should
- I do now?

21:11.479 --> 21:12.836
I don't know

21:12.837 --> 21:14.191
and I don't care.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.734
I just came down

21:15.735 --> 21:17.110
for the mail.
