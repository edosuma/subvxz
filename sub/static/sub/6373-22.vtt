00:02.602 --> 00:05.036
Bradford thinks his wife
isn't really a monster.

00:05.105 --> 00:06.970
<i>Let's show him what she's capable of.</i>

00:07.040 --> 00:08.974
I can't believe
she had this done to you.

00:09.042 --> 00:12.842
- It was just so horrible.
- I'm divorcing Claire.

00:12.912 --> 00:16.177
I heard you might be able to help me
with a problem. I need it eliminated.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.342
- I'm so sorry.
- I love you.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.318
He's my boyfriend.

00:20.387 --> 00:23.550
You sleep with women
to distract yourself from your life.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.488
Little something I found overseas.

00:25.558 --> 00:28.721
- Where did you get that jacket?
- A new up-and-coming designer.

00:28.795 --> 00:32.356
Tavares. When we're alone
you're straight and I'm naked.

00:32.432 --> 00:35.663
My father is being sent back
to Mexico to wait for his visa.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.401
OK, everybody, they just called!

00:42.475 --> 00:45.603
The taxi's going to be here
in five minutes!

00:45.678 --> 00:47.168
[Crash]

00:49.349 --> 00:50.338
I'm OK!

00:52.052 --> 00:54.987
This trip could not be
happening at a worse time.

00:55.055 --> 00:59.321
<i>Doesn't anyone care I am understudy
in the lead in West Side Story?</i>

00:59.392 --> 01:01.223
God forbid Joey Colano takes ill

01:01.294 --> 01:04.024
and I don't know my finger snaps
for the rumble.

01:04.096 --> 01:06.998
We're only going long enough
for Grandpa to get his visa.

01:07.067 --> 01:10.901
You'll hardly miss anything,
we get to meet all our family members,

01:10.970 --> 01:12.335
and practice our Spanish.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.896
[Speaks broken Spanish]

01:14.974 --> 01:17.101
You just said, "I ate your niece."

01:17.177 --> 01:19.771
Justin, help me, please.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.748
<i>Hilda! Vamonos!</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:26.343
Don't forget to ask your cousin
about the reception hall.

01:26.419 --> 01:30.719
No, Santos, we talked about this.
You're in charge of that.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.781
Look, I got to go, OK? I love you.

01:32.859 --> 01:34.258
OK, bye.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.322
That man. I give him one job,
he tries to pawn it off on me.

01:38.398 --> 01:41.231
Hey, maybe we could find you
a wedding dress in Mexico?

01:41.301 --> 01:44.134
The dress!
When am I gonna find a dress?!

01:44.204 --> 01:47.537
When am I gonna find the time
to do all this stuff?

01:47.607 --> 01:50.701
- Oh, maybe it's about the cake.
- No more calls. We're late.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.039
<i>- Hi, Betty.
- Henry.</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:53.477
<i>- It's Henry.
- It's Henry.</i>

01:53.546 --> 01:57.243
<i>- I know you're nervous about flying.
- Pick it up.</i>

01:57.317 --> 01:58.716
No!

01:58.785 --> 02:02.050
<i>... you're at far greater risk driving
than being on a plane.</i>

02:02.122 --> 02:05.649
<i>If you're hearing this, you haven't
driven to the airport yet,</i>

02:05.725 --> 02:09.422
<i>so never mind, have a great trip.</i>

02:09.496 --> 02:11.930
That is so sweet.

02:11.998 --> 02:14.432
So geeky. Why didn't you pick up?

02:14.501 --> 02:17.800
Because, Hilda... I'm done with Henry.

02:17.871 --> 02:22.137
He has a girlfriend. If it was meant
to be, it wouldn't be this hard.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.436
Whatever.

02:37.257 --> 02:41.387
OK, what's the one market
we're still not tapping into yet?

02:41.461 --> 02:43.861
Anyone? Single, young men.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.591
Well, we are a fashion magazine.

02:45.665 --> 02:49.123
Guys don't give a damn about clothes,
what do they care about?

02:49.202 --> 02:51.193
Beer, girls. Right?

02:51.271 --> 02:54.263
Guys want girls,
girls that are accessible.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.467
Girls they think they can get.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.137
We need to get those kind of girls
in this magazine.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.544
And, listen, they don't have to be ugly.

03:01.614 --> 03:04.481
Or fat, they should be
really good looking, hot.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.315
And wear really nice clothes.
You know what I mean?

03:07.387 --> 03:10.356
What you're saying is
we should put thin, pretty women

03:10.423 --> 03:14.189
wearing nice outfits
in this fashion magazine?

03:14.260 --> 03:16.820
Exactly! Oh, no.
There was something else.

03:16.896 --> 03:20.127
OK, while Daniel tries to remember
what he's talking about,

03:20.200 --> 03:21.565
let's move on to...

03:21.634 --> 03:24.626
Don't do that to me.
You're not the only one in charge.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.229
I am the one with pupils
not the size of quarters.

03:27.307 --> 03:30.936
OK, girls, tuck them back in.
You're both big.

03:31.010 --> 03:34.343
Now, let's talk about
the fearless women feature.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.577
We've managed to secure Jordan Dunn.

03:37.650 --> 03:41.347
Jordan Dunn? No. No, no, no.
That's not a very good idea

03:41.421 --> 03:44.948
It's a fabulous idea.
She hang glides, she ice climbs.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.755
She swam the English Channel
in a leather bikini. We have the title,

03:48.828 --> 03:50.420
"The Daredevil Wears Prada."

03:50.496 --> 03:52.589
I said no!

03:54.400 --> 03:56.868
You know what? This meeting's done.

03:57.503 --> 04:00.438
Thanks to Daniel, we've gone way over.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.610
That was... a little bizarre.

04:04.677 --> 04:08.511
That was amazing.
See, Jordan was Alex's girlfriend

04:08.581 --> 04:11.914
before he became a she.
They haven't seen each other since.

04:11.985 --> 04:16.285
Your boyfriend fakes his death
and comes back as a very big girl.

04:16.356 --> 04:18.551
There really isn't a card for that.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.652
Do not cancel that meeting.
It's going to be awesome. Yes!

04:22.729 --> 04:25.163
High five. Come on.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.364
We did not just high five him.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.131
Willie, you're smiling. Laugh lines.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.470
Oh, I don't care. Today is a good day.

04:35.541 --> 04:39.739
The brothers are fighting and Bradford
put the divorce papers in the mail.

04:39.812 --> 04:44.112
I'm that much closer
to becoming the next Mrs. Meade.

04:44.183 --> 04:46.549
You really can't see those lines,
can you?

04:46.619 --> 04:50.146
Nope. You're as dead on the outside
as you are on the inside.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.815
Oh.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.697
[Ringing]

05:01.367 --> 05:03.631
[Betty] Daniel. I'm on the plane.

05:03.703 --> 05:06.604
Thank you so much for the tickets.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.005
First class totally rocks.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.908
<i>I tried lobster and I watched Wild Hogs.</i>

05:11.978 --> 05:14.811
I think John Travolta's
better on a plane.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.314
How's the temp working out?

05:16.382 --> 05:19.180
Fine. I guess Amber
wasn't available, huh?

05:19.252 --> 05:21.220
Daniel, Amber couldn't type.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.915
Or use a pen
and she got lost on an elevator.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.651
Yeah, but she was hot.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.626
Ellen was Miss Subway, 1949.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.424
So how are you? Is everything OK?

05:30.496 --> 05:32.521
- Betty, I'm good.
- Are you sure?

05:32.598 --> 05:35.567
You know this call
costs like ten bucks a minute?

05:42.141 --> 05:44.803
Yes, yes, no.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.540
Burn it. Burn it and bury it.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.249
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Is that good or bad?

05:51.317 --> 05:53.615
I don't know.
She never used the triple "oh."

05:53.686 --> 05:55.153
- It's bad.
- Tavares,

05:55.221 --> 05:59.715
I'm sure you thought coconut shell
buttons were adventurous,

05:59.792 --> 06:02.852
- but you just murdered a blazer.
- Murderer!

06:02.929 --> 06:04.988
I was going for something new but...

06:05.064 --> 06:08.556
Well, don't. We don't want any
embarrassments. It's your debut.

06:08.634 --> 06:11.432
- Fix it by tomorrow night.
- Coconut shell buttons?

06:11.504 --> 06:14.234
You might as well have
punched her in the stomach.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.534
OK, did that go well?
Or does she hate me?

06:17.610 --> 06:19.168
Are you kidding me?

06:19.245 --> 06:22.373
She's bringing the New York buyers
to your studio tomorrow.

06:22.448 --> 06:25.212
You're going to be
a Wilhelmina Slater discovery.

06:25.284 --> 06:28.879
Because I hooked you up, you have
to make out with me in the ladies room.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.547
I'm supposed to be a big 'mo.

06:30.623 --> 06:33.091
Being straight in this business
doesn't work.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.992
So unfair.

06:36.062 --> 06:41.022
I finally got a hot boyfriend. I can't
use it to make the other sluts feel bad.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.001
Guess I'll just
make that up to you later, then.

06:44.404 --> 06:49.205
Hey, hey, that top is love.
Massani or Cavalli?

06:49.275 --> 06:51.800
Yeah, I'm not doing that with you.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.376
Keep the champlane coming.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.722
Thank you. Oh!

07:03.790 --> 07:07.226
Papi! Tell them you didn't get
your complimentary travel kit.

07:07.293 --> 07:10.023
If I get enough, I can use them
as bridesmaid's gifts.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.656
- Here, you can have mine.
- Oh, no. You keep yours.

07:12.732 --> 07:15.394
- You're my maid of honor.
- Oh, thank you.

07:16.235 --> 07:20.365
OK, so, Fernando, your cousin,
married Natalia.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.204
Their three kids are
Luis, Armando and Teresa.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.141
- That's right.
- Yes. OK.

07:25.211 --> 07:29.739
God, I just hate it that there's no one
on Mom's side of the chart.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.216
I can't help you there, sweetheart.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.083
I never really knew
about anybody except her mother.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.554
Well, what year did Grandma die?

07:37.623 --> 07:40.387
I don't know, Betty.
Sometime after Hilda was born.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.826
Mom never even talked about her.

07:42.895 --> 07:46.888
- I mean there must be...
- Concentrate on the people we do know.

07:48.701 --> 07:52.330
OK, I just...

07:52.405 --> 07:54.236
Dad, are you OK?

07:54.707 --> 07:56.572
<i>I'm sorry, mija.</i>

07:56.976 --> 07:59.706
I guess I might be
a little nervous about going home.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.179
I didn't leave under the best
circumstances.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.411
So they don't know
you killed mom's husband?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.477
What are you, crazy?
Somebody's going to hear you.

08:08.554 --> 08:12.320
Nobody knows anything except
you girls and my sister Mirta.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.256
Can we stop talking about this?

08:14.327 --> 08:17.455
- Betty, you're missing an earring.
- What?

08:17.930 --> 08:19.261
Oh, no!

08:19.332 --> 08:21.596
My "Dias" from
my "Buenos Dias" earrings.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.135
I knew I shouldn't have
brought my good jewelry.

08:24.470 --> 08:28.304
I know this is the worst thing to mix
with your cholesterol medication,

08:28.374 --> 08:31.309
I think a celebration is in order.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.971
Willie, I have a confession to make.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.212
You didn't sign the papers?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.945
You forgot she hired thugs
to beat me?

08:42.020 --> 08:44.182
- That she's a murderer?
- Wilhelmina.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.385
[Groans] Oh, sorry, it's just...

08:48.027 --> 08:51.485
...this injury. They say I'll have
to learn to live with it.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.898
Willie, I have been married to Claire
for so many years,

08:55.968 --> 08:58.630
how do you just start your life over?

08:58.704 --> 09:00.569
Claire was a toxic woman,

09:00.640 --> 09:03.473
I can understand
how you feel a bit drained.

09:03.543 --> 09:08.242
When I met Claire, I was "Brad Meade."

09:08.314 --> 09:11.374
Young, ambitious,
felt I could do anything.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.419
You still can. You just have
to get out in the world again.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.115
I'm going to take you
to a party tomorrow downtown.

09:17.189 --> 09:18.713
Party? I don't know.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.157
You just need
to shake things up a bit.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.321
Buy a new car. Get a new look.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.763
Oh, trust me.

09:26.832 --> 09:28.891
I can help you find Brad again.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.971
[Dance music playing]

09:41.714 --> 09:46.048
<i>Luis y Natalia y... Armando?</i>

09:47.253 --> 09:48.584

- No.</i>

09:49.622 --> 09:52.352
<i>Yo soy muy embarazada.</i>

09:52.425 --> 09:55.223
<i>- You just told them you're pregnant.
- Fantastico.</i>

09:55.294 --> 09:56.989
No, baby, no.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.732
I know exactly what I want my dress
to look like in my head,

10:00.800 --> 10:02.324
but I can't find it anywhere!

10:02.401 --> 10:04.926
And you feel like
you're running out of time.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.472
It's crazy, right?
There's plenty of time.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.007
No, there isn't.

10:09.075 --> 10:12.442
It's gonna go by like that and
you're gonna end up with nothing.

10:13.579 --> 10:15.638
Don't cry, Mirta.

10:15.715 --> 10:17.910
[Mirta] Why shouldn't I cry?

10:17.984 --> 10:21.545
I haven't seen my little brother
in 30 years.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.386
I would like to say
that you look the same.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.618
But you look like an old man.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.626
Oh, that means I'm old, too.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.996
- Is that why you're crying?
- Yeah.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.864
Oh, look at my son,
isn't he handsome?

10:35.935 --> 10:38.301
- Did you meet his wife?
- Oh, yes.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.931
She cannot have a baby.

10:41.007 --> 10:44.875
A cyst on one of her ovaries.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.139
Now, Mirta, go easy. You know how you
talk too much when you drink.

10:51.217 --> 10:54.380
Don't you worry.
I've never told anyone your secret.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.320
My, God! You are gray!

10:58.324 --> 11:00.451
How gray am I? Don't tell me.

11:00.526 --> 11:03.290
Look at you, you're so skinny.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.694
You're the third person
who's told me that.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.289
I love it here.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.667
OK, who's that old woman
who keeps staring at us?

11:11.737 --> 11:15.332
Oh, Isabella.
I forgot who she's related to,

11:15.408 --> 11:18.468
<i>- but she's a curandera.
- What's a curandera?</i>

11:18.544 --> 11:21.274
She's a healer. Very powerful.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.372
That woman knows things.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.212
And she can do things.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.718
My husband, Miguel,

11:27.787 --> 11:29.982
she touched it,
the next day it was gone.

11:30.056 --> 11:33.321
Wow. Well, maybe she could
help you with your ovaries.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.621
Why, when that Mirta drinks,
she'll tell anybody anything. Mirta!

11:38.798 --> 11:39.787
Oops.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.695
Hello.

11:43.769 --> 11:47.330
<i>Tu seras infeliz para el resto
de tu vida.</i>

11:47.406 --> 11:51.740
- Did she just say I'm gonna be unhappy?
- Yeah, for the rest of your life.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.974
<i>- Por que?
- Nunca conoceras felicidad</i>

11:55.047 --> 11:56.344
<i>porque estas estancada.</i>

11:56.415 --> 11:59.282
<i>- I'm sorry...
- Es muy triste, pero...</i>

11:59.351 --> 12:00.409
<i>Mas rapido.</i>

12:00.486 --> 12:02.886
- You just told her to talk faster.
- [Betty] No!

12:02.955 --> 12:05.048
<i>No mas rapido!</i>

12:05.124 --> 12:06.557
Hilda, what is she saying?

12:06.625 --> 12:08.490
She's saying that you're stuck.

12:08.561 --> 12:12.327
And that you can't move forward
until you look back.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.629
Oh, but there's hope. She sees a tree.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.766
- A tree?
- Yeah, a tree with missing branches.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.172
<i>La solucion es detras del arbol.</i>

12:23.242 --> 12:26.905
<i>Debe buscar detras del arbol.</i>

12:26.979 --> 12:29.311
And the answer is behind the tree.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.177
- What does that mean?
- The woman's nuts.

12:33.252 --> 12:37.985
<i>A minute ago she was eating a candle.
OK, thank you. Gracias.</i>

12:38.057 --> 12:40.617
Goodbye, Mrs. Crazy.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.842
<i>Hilda, I know what the curandera meant.</i>

13:38.918 --> 13:40.909
The tree. It's the family tree.

13:40.986 --> 13:45.082
And the empty branches,
that's Mom's side of the family.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.284
It's, like, so obvious.

13:47.359 --> 13:51.819
She wants me to fill in
Mom's side of the tree.

13:51.897 --> 13:54.365
You could climb it with those toenails.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.797
Good morning, Betty.

14:00.239 --> 14:03.003
That's... that's a lot of metal.

14:03.075 --> 14:06.272
- You want some coffee?
- Aunt Mirta?

14:07.313 --> 14:11.943
- You knew my mother, right?
- Oh, and you look so much like her.

14:13.586 --> 14:17.613
She and I were very close.
She used to call me from New York City.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.385
We would talk about everything.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.585
Then you must know about her family?

14:21.660 --> 14:25.357
Do you think you could help me fill out
her side of the family tree?

14:25.431 --> 14:27.524
Oh, no. I don't know
anything about that.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.592
She never talked about them.
I'll get your coffee.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.428
[Knock at door]

14:34.506 --> 14:36.997
Nick, I'm busy.
Whatever it is, it can wait.

14:37.743 --> 14:40.041
I've already waited two years.

14:41.413 --> 14:44.143
- Hello, Alex.
- Jordan.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.810
You look different.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.286
New haircut?

14:51.323 --> 14:52.449
Oh, hey, sugar burger.

14:52.524 --> 14:55.516
We'll go to my place right after work,
that will give us...

14:55.594 --> 14:58.563
<i>Don't tell me you forgot
we were gonna rent 3OO and enjoy</i>

14:58.631 --> 15:01.498
the mildly homophobic-slash-
homoerotic content?

15:01.567 --> 15:05.867
- I'm sorry. It's Tavares' party.
- Of course. Tavares.

15:05.938 --> 15:08.771
Clearly you've replaced me
with that African queen.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.173
- Looks like I'm yester-gay's news.
- OK.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.803
You're hurt. I am hearing that.

15:13.879 --> 15:16.643
- Want to go to the party?
- Why would I want to do that?

15:16.715 --> 15:19.548
- There'll be cute boys there.
- A little interested.

15:19.618 --> 15:21.518
- Work harder.
- You have to come.

15:21.587 --> 15:26.547
This is not just for me.
You are having the best hair day ever.

15:26.625 --> 15:32.086
Well played. But, just so you know,
I'll be bringing my own hag.

15:32.164 --> 15:34.064
Or should I say "haggis"?

15:34.133 --> 15:37.432
Polish up your best kilt, "C,"
we're going to a party.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.130
Sod off.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.139
Still finding our rhythm.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.972
If you think this is awkward,
I almost wore the same outfit.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.910
Wow.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.083
That really is you in there.

15:56.155 --> 15:59.591
- Jordan, I know you must hate me.
- I did.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.626
I'm a tough girl.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.821
I got over it.

16:03.896 --> 16:08.333
And I guess this explains a lot
about our relationship.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.995
Like, why you never
left the toilet seat up.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.505
- I wanted to tell you.
- I know.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.337
But, that would mean
you would have to say goodbye and,

16:17.409 --> 16:19.604
that was never
one of your talents, Alex.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.270
I'm so sorry.

16:22.514 --> 16:25.847
It's OK. This is who
you're supposed to be.

16:27.086 --> 16:30.817
By the way, the boobs are amazing.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.516
Thanks.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.355
They're yours. I took a picture of you
to the surgeon.

16:35.427 --> 16:38.760
- The nose is Kate Winslet's.
- Oh, yeah.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.632
Wow.

16:43.402 --> 16:47.498
- You really got married in this?
- And I felt like a fairy princess.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.803
What color was left for the bridesmaids?

16:49.875 --> 16:52.366
There was no way
she could wear white.

16:52.444 --> 16:53.809
You're on thin ice, lady.

16:54.713 --> 16:58.706
Wow. That's... fancy.

16:59.284 --> 17:03.516
You know, I was thinking I would go
a little more traditional.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.990
- Like, um... one or two colors.
- OK.

17:07.059 --> 17:09.152
But it's a wedding. Not a funeral.

17:09.928 --> 17:14.330
- Come on, I have two more.
- Two more. Fabulous.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.703
<i>- Let's have some of your ponche.
- Oh, no.</i>

17:18.771 --> 17:21.637
- Betty, I had too much last night.
- But it's so good.

17:21.707 --> 17:26.644
<i>- And we're still celebrating.
- That's true. Salud.</i>

17:26.712 --> 17:28.406
Drink up.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.679
Jordan!

17:33.419 --> 17:35.546
- Hey, beautiful!
- Hey, Daniel.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.849
Energy.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.552
You look amazing.
Wait till Alexis sees you.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.653
He... she already has.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.097
- That's hard to get used to.
- Oh, it was bad. How bad was it?

17:48.167 --> 17:51.603
It was weird,
but I think it's gonna be OK.

17:51.670 --> 17:55.162
Oh. Good. Great.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.199
I haven't seen you in forever. I wish we
could hang out but I'm doing a shoot.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.678
Bungee jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.772
- Right.
- I want to see you later.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.477
OK. Yeah.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.043
Hey.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.351
I want to come.
I want to jump with you.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.059
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.753
I thought your sport was women.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.388
I like to get my kicks
in other ways, too.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.994
OK. Come.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.294
But, I know you and Alex.

18:22.367 --> 18:25.461
Do you think this
is gonna bother him... her?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.540
Probably.

18:32.478 --> 18:35.242
All right then, Mr. Meade,
time to sell it.

18:35.314 --> 18:38.841
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
I made a suit? I have a charcoal...

18:38.917 --> 18:43.047
No suits. And remember,
we love anything the old fart puts...

18:43.122 --> 18:46.751
Ring-a-ding-ding.
Who is that hottie?

18:46.825 --> 18:50.261
I didn't think I could wear leather,
but... maybe I can.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.695
Of course you can. It's just... fun.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.896
Can I just do one thing?

19:00.172 --> 19:02.504
- Perfect.
- Good.

19:02.574 --> 19:06.066
Now, I gotta run,
but I will see you tonight.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.873
You look terrific, Brad.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.915
So, Mr. Meade,
are we happy with our outfit?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.420
Yes, very.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.548
Maybe it could be a little more fun?

19:22.661 --> 19:26.392
Your Auntie Teresa,
a widow for two weeks,

19:26.465 --> 19:29.161
and she's already
got a boyfriend half her age.

19:29.234 --> 19:32.169
Well, half her real age.

19:33.438 --> 19:34.962
Goodness. Oh!

19:35.040 --> 19:37.304
Your cousin, Marisol, her chi chis:

19:37.376 --> 19:39.173
Fake!

19:39.244 --> 19:41.804
Really? That's so surprising.

19:42.414 --> 19:45.850
Aunt Mirta? What about my mother's
side of the family?

19:45.918 --> 19:48.648
Well, I only know Rosa's mother,

19:48.720 --> 19:51.917
Yolanda, and forgive me for saying this,

19:51.990 --> 19:53.958
but that woman is a bitch.

19:54.026 --> 19:58.122
- Wait, did you just say "is?"
- Well, I haven't seen her in years.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.223
- But I hear...
- You're saying my grandma's alive?

20:02.734 --> 20:04.099
Crap.

20:08.307 --> 20:11.970
- [Betty] Grandma's alive?
- Yes.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.012
Dad, you lied to us.

20:14.079 --> 20:18.573
Why would you keep the one connection
we have to Mom away from us?

20:18.650 --> 20:21.346
That was your mother's idea, Betty.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.815
- Your grandmother hated me.
- Why?

20:24.890 --> 20:26.824
I was a cook.

20:26.892 --> 20:31.295
It was better her daughter stay with
a husband who beat her than be with me.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.728
The night we left

20:32.798 --> 20:36.427
your grandmother said
if Rosa walked out the door with me...

20:37.703 --> 20:39.466
...she was dead to her.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.598
So, they just never
spoke to each other again?

20:42.674 --> 20:44.437
Your mother tried.

20:44.509 --> 20:47.535
She sent letters,
pictures of you girls.

20:47.613 --> 20:51.208
They'd always come back, unopened.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.081
<i>Tio...</i>

20:55.153 --> 20:57.485
We're going to be late
for your appointment.

20:57.556 --> 21:00.525
Go, go, it's about your visa.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.394
We'll talk about this later.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.091
OK?

21:13.705 --> 21:14.899
I wanna meet her.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.642
I don't. She sounds like a monster.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.473
Hilda, she's our grandmother.

21:20.545 --> 21:23.514
Why do you wanna meet someone
who doesn't wanna meet you?

21:29.655 --> 21:32.123
You were amazing,
you weren't even scared.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.283
First time I bungeed,
I threw up in my hair.

21:34.359 --> 21:37.123
I know. I want to do something else.

21:37.195 --> 21:39.629
Let's base jump
off this building or skydive.

21:39.698 --> 21:43.600
You are such a freak. I can't believe
how much like Alex you've become.

21:43.669 --> 21:47.366
I am much better than Alex.

21:47.439 --> 21:50.738
In fact, I have a confession to make.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.902
The whole time you were dating Alex,

21:52.978 --> 21:55.970
I had a little crush on you.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.606
You don't think I knew?

22:01.853 --> 22:05.653
The best part...
you already met my parents.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.860
Tavares, this is Sebastian.

22:14.933 --> 22:16.662
He's the buyer for Barneys.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.635
And this is his boyfriend, Kenneth.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.264
This is Keith.
Kenneth and I broke up last spring.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.707
I caught him making out with a waiter
at the Ready-to-Wear show.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.573
Pret-a-poor taste.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.245
Well, this is fun.

22:35.487 --> 22:38.456
Well, so far, I'm very impressed.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.151
We're showing Tavares'
best designs later,

22:41.226 --> 22:43.490
they are, like, so good.

22:43.562 --> 22:46.087
And the greasy paws are on the Prada.

22:46.164 --> 22:48.496
Hey, you know what would be fun?
Get me a drink.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.229
Sure.

22:55.340 --> 22:59.037
You were just dismissed.
Turns out he's a mean gay.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.136
So what? You're a mean gay, too.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.544
Yes, but not to you.

23:02.614 --> 23:05.811
Yesterday, you told me
my head was too big for my neck.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.614
- Constructive criticism.
- What am I supposed to do?

23:08.687 --> 23:13.215
I don't know. As a friend,
it is my job to point things out...

23:13.291 --> 23:16.988
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.825
Oh, my God.

23:27.305 --> 23:30.900
Wow. It just... wow.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.536
It looks like Brad is back.

23:42.220 --> 23:45.383
Any preference for how we make
your old man disappear?

23:45.457 --> 23:47.891
Your mother was fond
of cutting brake lines.

23:47.959 --> 23:50.985
I don't want to know any details,
I just want him gone.

23:51.062 --> 23:55.055
Good, because once you get off this
elevator, you never see me again.

23:55.133 --> 23:56.623
[Elevator chimes]

24:05.177 --> 24:06.974
I won't see you after the lobby.

24:11.349 --> 24:14.341
So how far to this outlet mall?

24:14.419 --> 24:17.047
Clara said it's about two miles north.

24:17.122 --> 24:21.252
I'd better find a wedding dress there.
Because so far, I have nothing.

24:21.326 --> 24:25.319
Why is everything with this wedding so
hard? Sometimes I'm like, why bother?

24:25.397 --> 24:28.195
Hilda, everything's gonna be OK.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.667
- Where did you get a quesadilla?
- That guy in back.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.727
<i>Delicioso, Ramon. Muy bueno.</i>

24:35.273 --> 24:37.366
- I've had better.
- On a bus?

24:37.442 --> 24:39.069
You've got a point.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.809
Henry?

24:49.321 --> 24:51.846
Henry. What do you mean Henry?

24:51.923 --> 24:54.983
- It's nothing. I was seeing things.
- OK.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.995
I know that stuff
with mom and her mother upset you.

24:58.063 --> 25:01.760
Honestly, that's why when you
said let's go shopping I said "OK."

25:03.168 --> 25:07.127
Oh, my God. We're going to
that woman's house, aren't we?

25:07.205 --> 25:10.368
You were a lot smarter
before you got engaged.

25:10.442 --> 25:11.932
Owww!

25:12.511 --> 25:15.571
Baby, they love my stuff.

25:15.647 --> 25:18.946
Well, I'd hug you, but my
greasy paws might ruin your shirt.

25:19.017 --> 25:24.182
I'm sorry about that. It's just that
it's such a big night for me, baby.

25:24.256 --> 25:28.989
Then lose this jacket.
What is this still doing here?

25:29.060 --> 25:33.156
Well, I like it. It's my best.
Coconut shells are the next big thing.

25:33.231 --> 25:36.462
But Wilhelmina hates them.
They make her eyes bleed.

25:36.535 --> 25:40.631
If you want to get ahead
in this business, you do not cross her.

25:40.705 --> 25:43.833
What would I do without you, huh?
Come here.

25:56.922 --> 25:58.219
I think we're close.

25:58.290 --> 26:02.351
Aunt Mirta said she lived outside
Villanueva in a blue house.

26:02.427 --> 26:03.894
Well, I just want to go home.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.692
To be honest, that quesadilla
is not sitting so well.

26:06.765 --> 26:09.632
Usually when you buy cheese
cooked on a bus it's good.

26:09.701 --> 26:12.067
What are you hoping to get out of this?

26:12.137 --> 26:14.037
Hilda, I don't know.

26:14.105 --> 26:18.166
<i>But after what the curandera said,
and finding out about Grandma,</i>

26:18.243 --> 26:22.179
- I feel like I'm supposed to meet her.
- Well, good luck.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.306
'Cause I don't think
she wants to meet us.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.247
- It is him.
- What?

26:30.322 --> 26:31.880
Henry!

26:31.957 --> 26:34.926
Betty! Ow! Wait!

26:34.993 --> 26:37.860
Wait, Henry! Henry, wait!

26:37.929 --> 26:41.194
Betty, what the hell is going on?

26:41.266 --> 26:43.791
It was him, Hilda, it was Henry!

26:43.868 --> 26:48.362
[Hilda] Henry? Out here?
Honey, you are hallucinating!

26:48.440 --> 26:52.240
- No! No!
- Stop, stop!

26:53.912 --> 26:57.780
Wait! Betty, what are we
gonna do now?

26:57.849 --> 26:59.544
I don't know!

27:01.853 --> 27:05.812
I think that there was a town,
back that way just a few miles.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.017
- Miles!
- Oww!

27:11.296 --> 27:13.560
We may need this.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.267
I want my bridesmaid gift back.

27:17.335 --> 27:21.829
And I hope you know that I am not
throwing my bouquet anywhere near you.

27:21.906 --> 27:26.605
I hope Gina Gambarro gets it and if she
gets married before you, you'll be sad.

27:29.614 --> 27:31.741
[Music playing]

27:31.816 --> 27:34.148
Excuse us, Mr. Gossett Jr.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.849
I saw you kissing Tavares.

27:37.922 --> 27:40.948
You're in love with a gay man,
it's you and me all over again.

27:41.026 --> 27:43.859
- I was never in love with you.
- Are you kidding?

27:43.928 --> 27:46.294
When we met,
you couldn't keep your eyes off of me.

27:46.364 --> 27:48.298
That was before you got your veneers.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.766
You had that dark tooth,
I couldn't look away.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.668
- Big head! Nicole Bitchie.
- Dark tooth! Nelly Ripa.

27:53.738 --> 27:57.037
It's sad and pathetic, Mandy.
He's gay.

28:02.247 --> 28:05.910
- No, he's not.
- What?

28:05.984 --> 28:08.714
He's pretending,
to get ahead in the fashion world.

28:08.787 --> 28:12.587
He's straight and we are totally
seeing each other.

28:12.657 --> 28:15.888
OMG! He's pretending to be gay?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.757
A new twist on an old standard.

28:17.829 --> 28:22.198
Marc, you cannot tell anyone.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.527
Mandy.

28:24.602 --> 28:28.732
You're with another guy who's keeping
you a secret. It's like Daniel again.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.104
No, this is not Daniel.

28:30.175 --> 28:33.144
You are fabulous, Amanda.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.009
Why do you think
you don't deserve a relationship?

28:36.081 --> 28:38.276
Come out of the closet, sweetie.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.010
I promise it's better.

28:40.085 --> 28:42.519
It's OK.

28:42.587 --> 28:45.147
I know what I'm doing.

28:47.525 --> 28:49.390
What are you doing with Jordan?

28:49.461 --> 28:52.521
So far just making out,
but by later tonight I hope...

28:52.597 --> 28:55.498
- Stay away from her.
- Oh, I love this.

28:55.867 --> 28:56.925
You're jealous.

28:57.001 --> 28:59.731
Finally, I get the one thing
you can't have.

29:01.439 --> 29:06.069
I guess you should've thought of that
before you gave away the family jewels.

29:06.144 --> 29:07.941
Daniel... Daniel!

29:09.247 --> 29:13.377
- What is going on with you?
- You've never seen me win before.

29:13.451 --> 29:15.942
Alex, this is me winning.

29:19.557 --> 29:22.583
I can't believe you made me
walk all this way in these shoes.

29:22.660 --> 29:25.629
- My feet hurt, Betty.
- There's gotta be a bus soon.

29:25.697 --> 29:28.291
Well, let's just forget it,
let's just live here.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.960
Get jobs, watch our asses grow.

29:31.035 --> 29:32.935
I think we're still near Villanueva.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.528
<i>Excusa mi. Hablas ingles?</i>

29:37.175 --> 29:39.871
- Yes?
- Do you know of a small blue house?

29:39.944 --> 29:43.710
Around here? A woman lives in it,
Yolanda Salazar?

29:43.782 --> 29:47.479
- Sorry.
- Betty, just give it up!

29:49.554 --> 29:51.784
I'm gonna ask that man
selling dirty fruit.

29:51.856 --> 29:55.087
- You want some fruit?
- No! Yes.

29:55.160 --> 29:57.890
You look like you could use
a shot of tequila.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.486
Or two.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.129
[Speaking Spanish]

30:13.011 --> 30:15.104
Excuse me.

30:15.180 --> 30:18.013
- Henry! Henry, wait!
- Betty, where are you going?

30:18.750 --> 30:21.310
Hey, handsome.
I'm giving you a ticket

30:21.386 --> 30:24.549
because you are smoking indoors.

30:24.622 --> 30:27.614
Oh, my God. Mr. Meade.
I'm so sorry.

30:27.692 --> 30:30.024
- I had no idea.
- It's fine, Marc. Thank you.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.697
You owe me.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.961
Think of it as
taking a bullet for the team.

30:37.035 --> 30:40.027
If he doesn't feel good about himself,
he doesn't move on.

30:40.104 --> 30:42.072
If he doesn't move on,
I don't move up.

30:48.279 --> 30:50.941
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.809
I think your ear is oozing.

30:54.886 --> 30:56.410
Oh.

30:57.088 --> 30:58.316
Thank you.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.858

31:45.270 --> 31:47.568
Hello?

31:53.077 --> 31:54.305
Hi...

31:55.647 --> 31:57.444
...Yolanda Salazar?

32:00.585 --> 32:04.385
<i>Hola. Yo soy Betty.</i>

32:12.597 --> 32:16.363
You have no idea
how much I've wanted to meet you.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.423
<i>Mucho.</i>

32:18.336 --> 32:20.065
[Betty] Can you understand me?

32:21.739 --> 32:23.570
<i>[Betty] Oh... Bueno.</i>

32:23.641 --> 32:25.233
She won't talk to you.

32:26.010 --> 32:28.604
Her mind is no longer...

32:29.447 --> 32:31.210
I'm sorry.

32:37.055 --> 32:38.579
He stepped out.

32:39.257 --> 32:41.589
I was going through the proofs
from the shoot.

32:41.659 --> 32:44.958
I know what's going on
with you and Daniel.

32:45.029 --> 32:48.294
Well, that was fast.
I don't even know what's going on yet.

32:48.366 --> 32:52.029
You're gonna get hurt. Daniel's
not in this for the right reasons.

32:52.103 --> 32:55.800
He's angry and he's trying to
get back at me. This is all about me.

32:55.873 --> 32:58.808
Of course it's about you.

32:59.944 --> 33:02.936
It has always been about you.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.778
It's probably why
I'm attracted to Daniel.

33:05.850 --> 33:08.819
He's the closest I'll get
to being with you.

33:11.289 --> 33:12.847
What do you want me to do?

33:12.924 --> 33:15.552
Do what you should've done
two years ago.

33:17.195 --> 33:19.129
Have the guts to say goodbye.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.465
Goodbye, Jordan.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.287
Hey, I think I'm gonna go.

33:47.358 --> 33:51.158
What do you want me to do, walk you
to the door? Good night, Girlina.

33:52.597 --> 33:55.623
I think she's got a thing for you.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.726
Yeah. She'd sleep at
the foot of my bed if I let her.

33:58.803 --> 34:01.897
Sad little hags
always want what they can't have.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.907
Oh, really?

34:03.975 --> 34:07.672
Apparently, that sad little hag
can have it and has.

34:07.745 --> 34:10.737
In ways that are too disgusting
to even think about.

34:11.815 --> 34:15.809
You could've had a real relationship
with that woman and you'd be lucky.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.219
Because she's one of the nicest,
easiest girls around.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.224
- Marc?
- OK, maybe she's not nice.

34:21.292 --> 34:24.022
- Shut up.
- What's the lesbian talking about?

34:24.094 --> 34:27.690
Open your eyes, people. He's straight.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.699
Straight as the crease
on an old man's jeans.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.967
Well, this is my
very first public "inning."

34:36.040 --> 34:39.373
And while it's interesting,
I don't see how it's relevant.

34:39.444 --> 34:43.107
It isn't. The one thing we are
in the fashion industry is tolerant.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.775
If you look like that, you're in.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.784
The only important thing is the design.

Well, then, should we start
with some of his favorites?

35:56.053 --> 35:57.611
What is she doing?

35:58.189 --> 36:00.817
She says you left
some things behind.

36:21.279 --> 36:25.306
Mirta told me you were here.

36:25.383 --> 36:27.510
Did you understand what she said?

36:40.932 --> 36:43.196
I will.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.442
You should've stayed longer
at the party.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.274
It did get a little interesting.

36:55.346 --> 36:57.507
I'm sorry, Willie. Couldn't do it.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.310
I was a fool to think
I could ever be "Brad Meade" again.

37:01.385 --> 37:04.877
You know, I remember Brad.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.891
He ran this place when I started.

37:08.759 --> 37:10.852
The women in the building wanted him.

37:10.928 --> 37:14.728
However, there was one woman
who wasn't interested.

37:14.799 --> 37:16.323
Me.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.564
I thought Brad was a fool.

37:20.638 --> 37:25.905
But Brad grew into Bradford.

37:25.977 --> 37:30.437
A strong, wise, sexy man.

37:30.514 --> 37:34.507
A man who's ruined all other men for me.

37:51.068 --> 37:53.434
Here's to starting over.

37:59.443 --> 38:01.308
That feels good.

38:01.379 --> 38:04.041
You are gonna wash your hands?
You do touch food.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.813
This is the specialty of the house.

38:08.886 --> 38:10.217
You seem so stressed.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.985
I don't know why I wouldn't be.
I'm getting married in, like, a minute.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.390
And everything's so freaking hard.

38:16.460 --> 38:19.088
I got no hall booked,
I can't find a wedding dress.

38:19.163 --> 38:22.257
Seems like all the signs
are telling you to not get married.

38:22.333 --> 38:25.131
Well, I'm not really a girl
who believes in signs.

38:25.202 --> 38:29.002
Too bad. Because there is a reason
you cannot find that dress.

38:29.073 --> 38:32.042
There is a reason why you
were brought here... to me.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.780
I know what you're doing, Antonio.

38:36.847 --> 38:38.439
What?

38:38.516 --> 38:40.541
Who can blame me?

38:40.618 --> 38:43.746
But, am I right? Tell me, Hilda,

38:43.821 --> 38:45.914
why is everything so hard?

38:47.058 --> 38:49.788
Hilda! I found the house!

- Grandma gave me this.

- It was Mom's.
- Oh, my God!

It's beautiful.

38:58.569 --> 39:00.298
It's the dress.

but tell me in the car.

was with old man Meade.

worth something in a rare silk.

41:20.678 --> 41:23.442
- They denied my visa.
- So, what does that mean?

41:23.514 --> 41:28.008
It means that I have to stay here
for I don't know how long.

41:29.119 --> 41:31.280
OK, fine. Then we'll all stay.

41:31.355 --> 41:33.414
And we'll wait and we'll figure it out.

41:33.491 --> 41:37.825
- Dad, I'm not going home without you.
- No. You are going home, Betty.

41:37.895 --> 41:40.125
This is your future.

41:40.197 --> 41:44.099
I left my family once, too.

41:44.168 --> 41:47.137
Don't be afraid.

41:47.204 --> 41:51.231
<i>You're strong, mija.</i>

41:51.308 --> 41:53.242
Just like your mother.

41:54.305 --> 42:00.483
