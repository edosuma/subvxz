I can handle it.

11:32.089 --> 11:33.457
- Mom.
- Hey!

11:33.491 --> 11:35.192
Look who I ran into.

11:35.426 --> 11:36.994
Hello, Aria.

11:37.228 --> 11:38.162
Hi.

11:38.396 --> 11:40.431
I just dropped by
to see Mr. Ellis.

11:41.465 --> 11:43.100
Oh, the guidance
counselor?

11:43.134 --> 11:47.304
Jason offered to talk to some
of our at-risk students.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.107
Stoners in training,
like I was.

11:50.341 --> 11:53.477
I'm gonna tell them that
there is life after high school.

11:55.947 --> 11:58.082
Well, I'd better
get going.

11:58.616 --> 12:00.351
And thanks again for the note
you sent my mom.

12:00.385 --> 12:02.186
It really meant
a lot to her.

12:02.220 --> 12:04.355
Really? I'm so glad.

12:04.389 --> 12:06.056
So, can I bring
anything tomorrow?

12:06.091 --> 12:09.159
- No, please. Just yourself.
- Tomorrow?

12:09.194 --> 12:11.095
Yeah, I invited
Jason to dinner.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.232
See you tomorrow night.

12:21.439 --> 12:23.974
Why did you invite
him to dinner?

12:24.008 --> 12:26.110
What do you mean?
Is there a problem?

12:26.144 --> 12:29.380
No, just a little surprised,
I guess.

12:29.414 --> 12:31.348
You sent Mrs.
Dilaurentis a note?

12:31.383 --> 12:33.984
Yes, after the fashion show.

12:34.018 --> 12:37.154
That's why you invited him,
because of what happened?

12:37.188 --> 12:39.289
I suppose that was
partly the reason,

12:39.324 --> 12:41.458
but, you know, his family's
been through a lot,

12:41.493 --> 12:44.461
and I thought he could use
some human companionship.

12:44.496 --> 12:46.330
Don't you?

12:46.364 --> 12:48.332
I guess so.

12:48.366 --> 12:50.467
- Aria, the fashion show --
- I told you!

12:50.802 --> 12:52.436
Mom, it wasn't any of us.

12:52.470 --> 12:55.239
And I believe you,
but it was somebody,

12:55.273 --> 12:59.243
and I don't like the idea
of anybody terrorizing my kids,

12:59.277 --> 13:02.646
so if there's somebody at school that
your father and I need to know about --

13:02.681 --> 13:05.182
No, it's just a stupid prank.
It didn't mean anything.

13:08.153 --> 13:12.423
Okay, well, if you think
of something, anything,

13:12.957 --> 13:14.158
let me know.

13:14.192 --> 13:15.292
Okay.

13:17.428 --> 13:20.297
Oh, and your dad said
Mr. Fitz can come.

13:21.131 --> 13:22.232
Terrific.

13:22.767 --> 13:25.202
You probably want to get used
to calling him Ezra.

13:25.236 --> 13:27.171
Yeah.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.378

13:33.412 --> 13:35.447

13:52.131 --> 13:54.265
Hey, okay, my earbuds were in.
You couldn't even hear my music.

13:54.299 --> 13:56.067
That didn't stop you
from singing.

13:57.101 --> 13:58.236
How'd I sound?

13:58.270 --> 14:00.037
Loud.

14:02.173 --> 14:03.007
You know, we should do

14:03.041 --> 14:04.976
a video together,
like all of us.

14:08.547 --> 14:09.180
Not tonight.

14:10.214 --> 14:12.282
Are you okay?

14:12.316 --> 14:15.218
It's nothing.

14:15.253 --> 14:17.354
What was going on
with Caleb this morning?

14:18.356 --> 14:19.956
Business.

14:21.926 --> 14:23.326
He still has business?

14:23.361 --> 14:26.329
Yeah, he does.

14:26.364 --> 14:28.331
How do you feel
about that?

14:28.366 --> 14:30.934
You sound like Dr. Sullivan.

14:30.968 --> 14:33.136
And you didn't
answer my question.

14:46.284 --> 14:48.852
So, you having fun
at Hanna's?

14:49.887 --> 14:52.556
Every night's a sleepover,
even school nights.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.758
- Uh-oh.
- No uh-oh.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.528
I'm lucky it worked out
the way it did.

14:57.562 --> 15:00.798
Very lucky.
Seriously.

15:00.832 --> 15:02.433
- Morning.
- Morning.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.635
Hey, did you talk
to Garrett yet?

15:05.669 --> 15:08.639
Not yet. I've been slammed with
practice and the new workout.

15:09.173 --> 15:12.343
Okay, uh, well,
do you want me to try?

15:12.377 --> 15:14.678
Yes. You're better at getting
people to talk, anyway.

15:14.713 --> 15:16.680
- I am?
- You are.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.682
Yeah. Tag up
later, okay?

15:18.717 --> 15:20.584
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

15:20.618 --> 15:22.786
Will you come with me
to talk to Garrett?

15:23.821 --> 15:26.724
I can't. I told my mom I'd go
home and help her with dinner.

15:27.258 --> 15:28.659
Oh! That's right.

15:29.193 --> 15:30.694
It's "guess who's coming
to dinner" night.

15:30.729 --> 15:31.795
You're so
not helping.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.398
No, it's gonna go
better than you think.

15:34.432 --> 15:36.567
Trust me, Mr. Fitz
will knock 'em dead.

15:36.601 --> 15:38.602
It's not just Ezra.

15:38.636 --> 15:39.737
My mom invited Jason.

15:39.771 --> 15:41.472
Wait, she did what?

15:41.506 --> 15:44.608
Yeah, he was here at school,
and she was talking to him,

15:44.642 --> 15:46.677
and invited him
to dinner.

15:46.711 --> 15:49.446
She invited him
into your house?

15:49.481 --> 15:50.547
Yeah.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.516
She said she feels
sorry for him.

15:54.686 --> 15:56.520
But I guess
I understand.

16:00.657 --> 16:01.558
I'm late.

16:07.765 --> 16:09.433
Logan Reed quit his job
at the messenger service

16:09.467 --> 16:10.734
after Emily talked to him.

16:11.269 --> 16:12.403
She scared him.

16:13.437 --> 16:14.772
She scared him plenty.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.608
He's registered
at Hollis college,

16:17.642 --> 16:20.511
but no one's seen him
in class for a week.

16:20.545 --> 16:22.479
He's been crashing
with a buddy,

16:22.514 --> 16:25.349
but, uh, buddy
says he's gone.

16:25.383 --> 16:26.750
Gone.

16:27.285 --> 16:29.453
This guy can't stay
underwater for long.

16:29.487 --> 16:30.788
We'll find him.

16:31.322 --> 16:32.823
If I hear anything,
I'll call you, okay?

16:32.857 --> 16:34.458
Okay.

16:35.493 --> 16:36.727
But, uh, Spencer,

16:36.761 --> 16:40.664
don't expect to find
any surprises here.

16:40.698 --> 16:42.466
All these loose ends,

16:42.500 --> 16:44.635
they're all gonna lead
back to the same place.

16:45.169 --> 16:46.437
Ian.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.318
Ashley: <i>I had a feeling</i>
<i>you would call.</i>

17:01.352 --> 17:02.686
Did Hanna say anything

17:02.720 --> 17:05.422
about what happened
at the fashion show?

17:05.957 --> 17:07.657
I didn't press her on it.

17:08.692 --> 17:10.493
What do you
think that was?

17:12.363 --> 17:13.763
Well, you know
about mean girls.

17:14.798 --> 17:16.333
They had 'em
when we were in school.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.801
Not like this,
we didn't.

17:18.837 --> 17:21.505
No, not like this.

17:22.773 --> 17:25.541
And I don't think
this just started.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.743
I think it's been
going on for a while,

17:27.779 --> 17:29.646
and we're just now
noticing it.

17:30.681 --> 17:32.416
I think you're right.

17:32.450 --> 17:34.518
- You do?
- Alison?

17:35.052 --> 17:36.420
Hanna being hit
by that car?

17:36.454 --> 17:38.689
Ian in the bell tower,
everything else?

17:38.723 --> 17:40.557
It's easy
to get paranoid,

17:40.992 --> 17:43.594
start seeing connections where
there aren't any connections.

17:43.628 --> 17:45.496
I just knew
if I didn't speak

17:45.530 --> 17:46.697
to another parent
about this,

17:46.731 --> 17:48.532
my head was going
to explode.

17:48.566 --> 17:49.766
Who else have
you talked to?

17:50.301 --> 17:52.369
Well, Emily's mom
is in Texas,

17:52.403 --> 17:54.838
and I didn't really want
to do this over the phone.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.640
The Hastings?

17:57.775 --> 17:59.676
I'll tell you
one thing.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.379
I think we rolled over
way too quickly

18:02.413 --> 18:05.382
on that therapist deal,
separating the girls?

18:05.416 --> 18:07.384
I am not gonna do
that again.

18:07.418 --> 18:09.453
It seemed to make sense
at the time.

18:09.487 --> 18:10.787
That was about
helping anyone.

18:10.822 --> 18:13.390
That was about
Peter Hastings.

18:13.924 --> 18:16.326
Never met a problem
he couldn't buy off,

18:16.361 --> 18:17.828
one way or the other.

18:47.425 --> 18:49.493
What have you got there?

18:49.527 --> 18:53.664
Oh, I was just
clearing the Ivy, and...

18:56.033 --> 18:57.634
Where was this?

18:57.969 --> 19:01.572
Right here, about half a foot
down on the property line.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.643
I'll take care of it.

19:07.178 --> 19:08.645
What is it?

19:08.680 --> 19:11.415
Nothing to worry about.

19:11.449 --> 19:12.683
Why would
somebody bury it?

19:12.717 --> 19:15.519
It's all right, Toby.

19:15.553 --> 19:18.589
- I said I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

19:26.553 --> 19:27.599
Elliot:
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

19:27.753 --> 19:29.199
Has he noticed
we're gone?

19:29.299 --> 19:30.466
Does he...
looks anxious at all?

19:33.167 --> 19:35.400
- Thanks, Byron.
- Thought you were kidding.

19:35.434 --> 19:36.534
No kidding.

19:36.568 --> 19:38.069
I may have carried
the baby for nine months,

19:38.103 --> 19:41.103
but Elliott's planning to carry
him straight through college.

19:41.137 --> 19:42.571
If you ever need a sitter,
you should call me.

19:42.605 --> 19:44.473
- I'd love to do it.
- That'd be great!

19:44.507 --> 19:46.442
Just stop by the house
with a blood sample.

19:46.476 --> 19:49.144
The background check
won't take more than an hour.

19:49.179 --> 19:50.512
Hey, where's Mike?

19:50.547 --> 19:53.148
Well, he promised
he'd be here, so...

19:53.183 --> 19:54.616
Uh, yeah, he's
on his own clock.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.552
You'll find out
about that soon enough.

19:57.086 --> 19:59.288
( Doorbell ringing )

20:01.490 --> 20:02.157
Hello.

20:02.192 --> 20:03.492
So glad you could make it.

20:03.526 --> 20:05.160
Thank you
for inviting me.

20:05.195 --> 20:07.329
- Thank you.
- For you.

20:07.363 --> 20:08.330
Aria.

20:08.964 --> 20:09.598
Hi, Ezra.

20:10.257 --> 20:12.158
I'll put these
in some water.

20:12.193 --> 20:14.227
Ezra! Hey.

20:14.261 --> 20:17.197
Byron. A gift
for the host.

20:17.231 --> 20:19.265
Whoa, this is
serious scotch.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.134
Well, always
works for me.

20:21.168 --> 20:23.838
- Uh, Byron? Help?
- Excuse me.

20:23.872 --> 20:25.239
Isn't that the scotch
you said tasted

20:25.273 --> 20:26.974
like diet cola
and iodine?

20:27.008 --> 20:30.211
Yes, until I asked the guy at the
liquor store what your dad liked.

20:30.745 --> 20:32.813
This is Nancy Partha.
This is Ezra.

20:33.348 --> 20:34.548
Hi, Ezra Fitz.

20:34.582 --> 20:35.682
Nice to meet you.

20:35.717 --> 20:37.351
Good to see
you, Elliott.

20:37.385 --> 20:39.720
( Doorbell ringing )

20:44.459 --> 20:46.693
Hey. Come in.

20:47.728 --> 20:49.195
Sorry I'm late.

20:49.230 --> 20:52.232
Uh, no, it's fine.

20:52.266 --> 20:54.100
Thanks.

20:59.273 --> 21:01.941
- A hockey stick?
- Part of one.

21:02.226 --> 21:04.210
It was snapped off
at the handle,

21:04.245 --> 21:06.146
and the blade
was splintered,

21:06.180 --> 21:08.248
like somebody used it
to hit something hard.

21:08.482 --> 21:09.683
And it was buried?

21:09.717 --> 21:11.718
I thought it was
some old junk,

21:11.753 --> 21:14.421
- until your dad saw it.
- What did he say?

21:14.455 --> 21:16.636
At first, I thought
he was angry.

21:16.641 --> 21:18.860
Now I think he
might've been scared.

21:26.584 --> 21:27.984
It was white
and blue.

21:28.019 --> 21:29.953
Those are rosewood colors.

21:29.987 --> 21:33.823
There was a piece of tape
on what was left of the handle.

21:33.858 --> 21:36.560
It had "Hastings"
written on it.

21:36.594 --> 21:38.895
Was that yours
or Melissa's?

21:41.732 --> 21:43.967
It's just an old practice stick
I use sometimes.

21:44.001 --> 21:47.571
- It was Melissa's.
- It'll do.

21:47.605 --> 21:49.873
No, it's like this.

21:51.609 --> 21:52.709
Oh.

21:54.511 --> 21:57.981
Ali, when did you become
so interested in field hockey?

21:58.515 --> 21:59.716
I'm not.

22:01.552 --> 22:02.719
Yet.

22:02.753 --> 22:05.555
I'm just considering
my options.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.958
Oh! Maybe you're
interested in someone

22:07.992 --> 22:10.560
who's interested
in field hockey?

22:10.595 --> 22:11.995
Boys don't play
field hockey.

22:12.029 --> 22:14.030
You don't have to play the game
to be interested.

22:16.934 --> 22:20.003
That's the same stick that Toby
found buried behind my house.

22:20.037 --> 22:22.806
- Are you sure?
- <i>Absolutely the same one.</i>

22:29.981 --> 22:32.649
How did it get
in your backyard?

22:32.683 --> 22:35.585
<i>Well, you don't bury</i>
<i>old sporting equipment, but...</i>

22:35.620 --> 22:37.854
you do bury
murder weapons.

22:38.388 --> 22:39.689
Are you serious?

22:39.724 --> 22:41.024
<i>It was in Ali's bedroom</i>

22:41.058 --> 22:42.692
the summer she was killed.

22:42.727 --> 22:43.893
Anybody could've used it.

22:43.928 --> 22:45.996
Anybody?

22:46.030 --> 22:47.631
Jason: Alison.

22:48.933 --> 22:50.634
Mom wants you.

22:50.668 --> 22:52.136
- Why?
- I don't know.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.803
She didn't say why,
okay? Just go.

22:53.838 --> 22:55.705
I got better things
to do than hunt you down.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.707
- Like what?
- What's this for?

22:57.742 --> 22:58.875
- It's for me.
- Oh, yeah?

22:58.909 --> 23:00.844
- Give it back.
- Oh, yeah?

23:00.878 --> 23:03.546
- Give it back, Jason.
- Or what?

23:04.682 --> 23:05.849
( Gasps ) Be careful!

23:10.988 --> 23:13.590
Ooh!

23:13.624 --> 23:15.592
Too bad.

23:15.626 --> 23:17.761
You're not gonna get
a second chance, Ali.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.567
<i>Jason was in the house</i>
<i>that summer.</i>

23:24.602 --> 23:26.803
- But so was Ian.
- <i>Yeah, but Jason is the one</i>

23:26.837 --> 23:28.838
who says he can't remember
the night Ali disappeared,

23:28.873 --> 23:31.541
<i>and I'm starting to think</i>
<i>that is awfully convenient.</i>

23:31.575 --> 23:32.642
Spencer, look,

23:32.677 --> 23:34.577
this could just be
"A" playing with us again.

23:34.612 --> 23:35.779
<i>Except that we</i>
<i>didn't find this.</i>

23:35.813 --> 23:38.615
Somebody else did, and if
my dad hadn't stopped Jason

23:38.649 --> 23:40.950
from building that fence,
no one ever would've found it.

23:40.985 --> 23:42.852
What's your dad
saying about this?

23:42.887 --> 23:44.020
I haven't spoken
to him yet.

23:44.555 --> 23:46.556
He's in a meeting.
He won't be home till late.

23:46.590 --> 23:47.891
Ella: Aria!

23:48.725 --> 23:49.793
Hey, I gotta go.

23:49.827 --> 23:51.628
<i>Aria, think</i>
<i>about this.</i>

23:51.662 --> 23:52.996
Think about what
this means.

23:54.030 --> 23:56.599
I'll think about it. Bye.

24:00.504 --> 24:01.938
Em, you don't have
to go to the library.

24:01.972 --> 24:03.773
It won't bother me
if you study here.

24:04.808 --> 24:05.842
All due respect,
studying here

24:05.876 --> 24:07.844
is like studying
at the mall.

24:08.678 --> 24:10.580
I study at the mall
all the time.

24:10.614 --> 24:12.582
Yeah, well,
I'm different.

24:13.116 --> 24:14.584
Is this a gay thing?

24:14.618 --> 24:16.586
No, it's a brain thing.

24:18.120 --> 24:18.888
Hello.

24:18.923 --> 24:20.757
Hello. Good-bye.

24:24.460 --> 24:25.494
Was it something
I said?

24:25.779 --> 24:29.348
She's just so studious,
that's all.

24:32.786 --> 24:34.520
Your mom home?

24:34.554 --> 24:37.523
No, she's out to dinner
with my dad.

24:37.557 --> 24:39.625
Oh.

24:39.659 --> 24:41.527
What's that mean?

24:41.561 --> 24:45.631
It means... "Oh."

24:54.541 --> 24:57.710
Ezra: I was either going
to Japan or Europe.

24:57.744 --> 24:59.779
I ended up biking
through Connor Pass

24:59.813 --> 25:01.000
on my way to Kerry.

25:01.015 --> 25:03.216
So, why did you
pick Ireland?

25:03.250 --> 25:04.651
I love Joyce
and Beckett.

25:04.685 --> 25:07.319
I wanted to see
where they started.

25:07.354 --> 25:10.490
Byron: And you did it
by bike? That's great.

25:10.525 --> 25:12.459
I've got a bike
in my garage.

25:12.493 --> 25:14.727
Every morning
it mocks me.

25:14.761 --> 25:16.695
Oh, you'll get
back on it.

25:16.730 --> 25:18.798
Just have to add
a baby seat.

25:18.832 --> 25:20.500
- You cycle?
- Uh, some, yeah.

25:20.535 --> 25:23.569
When I first took off from
college, I did the Kona coast.

25:23.603 --> 25:25.704
That's where they have
the triathlon, right?

25:26.539 --> 25:27.974
Yeah, I wanted
to clear my head

25:28.008 --> 25:31.010
before I came back here.
Riding those lava fields

25:31.045 --> 25:33.280
is like being
on the moon, you know?

25:34.314 --> 25:35.581
That's intense.

25:35.615 --> 25:36.416
Yeah, it's
what I needed.

25:36.950 --> 25:39.451
( Doorbell ringing )

25:44.107 --> 25:46.142
- Aria.
- Hi.

25:46.176 --> 25:48.344
Are your parents home?

25:48.378 --> 25:50.546
Mom? Dad?

25:53.050 --> 25:55.284
- Hi, Barry.
- Sorry to interrupt,

25:55.319 --> 25:57.119
but it's about Mike.

25:57.154 --> 25:59.388
He's okay, but we have
a situation.

25:59.423 --> 26:01.057
What kind
of situation?

26:01.091 --> 26:02.992
Looks like he broke
into a house.

26:03.026 --> 26:05.094
- Byron: He what?
- Over on Morrison.

26:05.128 --> 26:07.163
Ella: There's gotta be
some kind of mistake.

26:07.197 --> 26:08.397
I'm afraid not.
It's Mike.

26:08.432 --> 26:10.132
He must've thought
the place was empty.

26:10.167 --> 26:11.334
Homeowner grabbed him
and called us.

26:11.368 --> 26:12.468
He's at the station now.

26:12.502 --> 26:15.037
If I could get you
to come down there...

26:15.072 --> 26:17.073
Yes, of course.
Do you want to stay here?

26:17.107 --> 26:18.174
No, no,
we'll both go.

26:21.511 --> 26:23.379
Aria. Aria,
please stay here.

26:23.413 --> 26:24.513
Yeah.

26:51.233 --> 26:52.233
Peter: Toby.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.872
Hey. Glad
I caught you.

26:57.907 --> 27:00.441
I wanted to talk to you
about today.

27:01.474 --> 27:03.343
Is this about
the hockey stick?

27:03.378 --> 27:06.414
I thought it was junk
from the DiLaurentis's yard.

27:06.447 --> 27:08.548
I have a real problem
with them.

27:08.782 --> 27:11.152
It said "Hastings"
on the stick.

27:11.185 --> 27:14.155
Yeah, I realized that.
I also realized

27:14.188 --> 27:16.224
it might've looked a little
strange, my taking it that way.

27:16.258 --> 27:20.260
I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.
It was nothing.

27:20.294 --> 27:24.331
Um, you know, in fact,
if you talk with Spencer,

27:24.365 --> 27:27.068
don't bother mentioning
it to her, okay?

27:28.102 --> 27:30.370
Too late.

27:31.423 --> 27:32.523
You told her.

27:32.557 --> 27:34.825
Didn't know
I shouldn't.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.544
What'd she say?

27:38.646 --> 27:41.749
It didn't seem to mean
anything to her.

27:44.017 --> 27:46.119
There's no point in telling her
about this conversation, is there?

27:47.755 --> 27:49.122
No, sir.

27:53.827 --> 27:54.796
Good night, Toby.

27:55.829 --> 27:57.731
Thanks for all
the hard work.

27:59.501 --> 28:01.068
Good night,
Mr. Hastings.

28:09.778 --> 28:11.713
- Hey, I got this.
- No, no.

28:11.747 --> 28:13.814
I kind of just want
to keep moving.

28:13.849 --> 28:14.916
Okay.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.485
The Parthas took
that salad, right?

28:17.519 --> 28:18.952
Yeah, they just
wanted to go home.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.655
Separation anxiety.

28:22.489 --> 28:24.659
Not the anticipated
evening, was it?

28:24.693 --> 28:26.192
No.

28:26.193 --> 28:27.729
You were doing
really well.

28:27.762 --> 28:29.630
I was, wasn't I?

28:29.664 --> 28:31.932
Yeah. Do you practice
much at home?

28:31.966 --> 28:34.901
Oh, just the initial
hellos and smile.

28:37.872 --> 28:39.974
So, uh, who's Jason?

28:40.008 --> 28:42.943
- He's Ali's brother.
- No, I know that.

28:42.977 --> 28:45.747
I just didn't know he was
friends of the family.

28:45.780 --> 28:47.914
Yeah, my mom
and his mom are friends.

28:47.950 --> 28:49.684
Oh.

28:49.717 --> 28:51.852
I'm gonna go see
if he wants more coffee.

28:51.887 --> 28:53.687
Great, I'll run
the dishwasher.

28:53.722 --> 28:54.789
Okay.

28:57.959 --> 28:58.992
You want some more?

28:59.828 --> 29:01.896
Sure, a little.

29:04.599 --> 29:06.867
Mike promised me
he wouldn't do this anymore.

29:07.401 --> 29:08.802
He probably meant it
when he said it.

29:11.539 --> 29:13.640
Give me that.
Sit down.

29:16.978 --> 29:18.780
Take a breath.

29:18.813 --> 29:20.747
He must be so angry at me.

29:20.782 --> 29:22.050
Why would Mike
be angry at you?

29:22.784 --> 29:23.885
Because...

29:24.418 --> 29:27.655
We're in the middle of this
mess with Ian and mom and dad.

29:28.888 --> 29:31.325
If it weren't for me, he probably would've
gotten more attention from my parents.

29:31.659 --> 29:32.659
No, no, no.
Trust me,

29:32.693 --> 29:34.695
you're not the reason
Mike is doing this.

29:34.979 --> 29:36.297
How do you know that?

29:36.331 --> 29:38.032
I know a lot about
misplaced guilt.

29:38.666 --> 29:40.668
Look, the amount
of trouble Mike's in

29:40.702 --> 29:42.836
depends on how many times
he's done this.

29:42.870 --> 29:45.872
Do you have any idea how many
places he's broken into?

29:48.744 --> 29:50.778
( Indistinct )

29:55.015 --> 29:55.884
Mike.

29:55.917 --> 29:57.684
- Mike!
- Mike, wait.

29:57.718 --> 29:59.753
I don't want
to talk about it.

30:03.891 --> 30:04.825
You don't want
to talk about it,

30:04.860 --> 30:06.760
but you are going
to talk about it.

30:10.398 --> 30:11.666
How was
the dinner party?

30:11.700 --> 30:13.934
It was fine, till the cops
showed up to let us know

30:13.968 --> 30:16.037
that our son had been arrested
for breaking and entering.

30:16.570 --> 30:17.104
Byron.

30:19.206 --> 30:20.807
Get in the car.

30:26.914 --> 30:28.749
You're angry.

30:29.784 --> 30:30.818
And you're not?

30:30.852 --> 30:33.053
Oh, no, I'm angry,
but more importantly,

30:33.088 --> 30:34.755
how did we miss this?

30:34.789 --> 30:36.691
I don't even know
what "this" is.

30:36.724 --> 30:39.726
Well, he's not a criminal, so it's
gotta be about something else.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.896
What? What could he possibly
be walking around with

30:41.930 --> 30:43.898
that he couldn't
talk to us about?

30:43.932 --> 30:46.733
I don't know, but maybe we need
to do a better job asking.

30:46.767 --> 30:47.968
( Sighs )

30:55.711 --> 30:57.110
( Sighs )

31:03.251 --> 31:04.784
So, you teach
at Hollis.

31:05.620 --> 31:06.819
Yes.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.724
Is that how you know
Professor Montgomery?

31:10.258 --> 31:14.095
Yes, and I taught with Ella
at Rosewood High this year.

31:19.466 --> 31:20.700
Did you have Aria?

31:23.070 --> 31:24.937
In any of your classes.

31:25.472 --> 31:26.941
Yes, I did.

32:14.721 --> 32:16.657
I was just thinking
you should go now.

32:18.459 --> 32:20.093
What, the both
of us?

32:21.128 --> 32:21.796
Yes, please.

32:22.329 --> 32:23.430
Are you sure?

32:23.464 --> 32:25.166
My parents are going to be home
with Mike any second,

32:25.200 --> 32:26.868
and it's probably a good idea
that he doesn't have

32:26.901 --> 32:28.836
to deal with anyone
but family right now.

32:29.369 --> 32:29.970
Okay.

32:37.144 --> 32:38.878
Do you want us to help
finish cleaning up?

32:38.914 --> 32:40.648
No, I'm good, really.

32:40.682 --> 32:42.983
- Let me know how your brother's doing.
- I'll call.

32:43.517 --> 32:44.784
We'll talk tomorrow?

32:44.820 --> 32:47.120
Yes, absolutely.
Thanks. I'm sorry.

33:01.401 --> 33:04.037
- Good night.
- Good night.

33:06.072 --> 33:08.008
Buy it now
and save some money.

33:08.041 --> 33:11.646
You're gonna want it next week,
and I can't guarantee that price.

33:12.680 --> 33:13.680
Done.

33:19.587 --> 33:20.154
Don't start.

33:20.488 --> 33:21.789
I'm not trying
to change you.

33:21.822 --> 33:22.889
Then you shouldn't
push me on this stuff.

33:22.923 --> 33:24.892
I'm not pushing,
I'm suggesting.

33:24.925 --> 33:27.628
What, that I should be frying
burgers for minimum wage?

33:27.662 --> 33:29.963
I'm just saying I see you
doing this sketchy stuff

33:29.997 --> 33:32.899
and I worry about you.

33:32.934 --> 33:35.568
What I'm doing now is legit
compared to other stuff.

33:36.002 --> 33:36.970
What's that supposed to mean?

33:37.505 --> 33:40.707
It means you already know more
about me than anybody else,

33:40.742 --> 33:43.811
so why can't we just
keep it where it is?

33:44.345 --> 33:46.180
All right.

33:47.381 --> 33:49.649
So, where do you come down
on the whole natural

33:49.684 --> 33:51.385
versus synthetic
extensions debate?

33:51.618 --> 33:53.988
I mean, does affordability
and easy maintenance

33:54.021 --> 33:56.490
really outweigh the look
and feel of real human hair?

33:56.925 --> 33:59.126
Okay.

34:00.159 --> 34:01.561
( Sighs )

34:04.565 --> 34:07.200
Two years ago, I was
living in Allentown,

34:07.235 --> 34:09.503
and there were
these guys...

34:10.237 --> 34:12.170
Actual bad guys.

34:13.005 --> 34:15.208
They stole cars
on order.

34:17.945 --> 34:19.579
I did some work
for them...

34:20.612 --> 34:22.148
Hacking into the DMV,

34:22.181 --> 34:25.284
laundering VIN numbers.

34:25.719 --> 34:26.552
Nobody got hurt,

34:26.588 --> 34:29.289
but it was just
a matter of time,

34:29.322 --> 34:31.591
so I got out.

34:33.159 --> 34:36.161
And these guys were
really not happy about it.

34:36.697 --> 34:39.465
Before they could figure out
what to do, I was gone.

34:40.498 --> 34:42.501
So, trust me,
I know the difference

34:42.536 --> 34:47.206
between sketchy
and criminal.

34:51.245 --> 34:53.313
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

34:53.347 --> 34:55.380
Maybe you should
tell the cops.

34:56.116 --> 34:58.151
There's a difference
between being honest

34:58.186 --> 34:59.485
and being suicidal.

35:01.821 --> 35:04.224
You've never told
anyone this, have you?

35:05.558 --> 35:07.193
No.

35:07.861 --> 35:10.363
I haven't.

35:10.598 --> 35:13.466
And I'd appreciate you
keeping it to yourself.

35:13.701 --> 35:15.434
Cross my heart.

35:29.349 --> 35:32.251
- No.
- Spencer, go upstairs.

35:33.287 --> 35:35.122
- Please.
- Spencer...

35:35.155 --> 35:36.356
- Please.
- Let go!

35:36.890 --> 35:39.559
Stop. Let go!
Stop it.

35:41.296 --> 35:43.363
You can't burn that.

35:43.898 --> 35:46.166
I can do whatever I want
with junk I find on my property.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.301
But it could
be evidence.

35:47.334 --> 35:48.535
We don't need more evidence

35:48.569 --> 35:51.204
now that Ian Thomas is
in a grave I paid for.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.608
Please, try
to understand.

35:55.142 --> 35:56.510
I'm tired, Spencer.

35:57.043 --> 35:58.611
Your mother
is tired.

35:59.446 --> 36:02.115
And I'm not taking
the chance of more questions

36:02.149 --> 36:04.217
over some damn piece
of wood.

36:05.253 --> 36:07.387
This is over.

36:07.421 --> 36:09.289
No more questions.

36:09.323 --> 36:12.224
It could be important.

36:12.260 --> 36:14.160
Important?

36:16.331 --> 36:18.398
Like the trophy
you found?

36:22.169 --> 36:24.570
I-I didn't put that
in the yard.

36:25.104 --> 36:30.177
It doesn't matter
who put it there or why.

36:31.278 --> 36:32.579
It doesn't mean anything.

36:34.432 --> 36:35.631
It's nothing.

36:37.867 --> 36:40.436
It doesn't exist.

36:54.753 --> 36:57.856
I told him it didn't
mean anything to you.

36:57.890 --> 37:00.025
I'm sorry
you had to lie.

37:00.059 --> 37:02.594
No, it doesn't matter.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.816
When I came
down the stairs

37:07.851 --> 37:10.052
and I saw what he
was doing, I thought,

37:10.986 --> 37:13.055
"Oh, my God,
he thinks I killed her."

37:13.089 --> 37:15.958
No, he couldn't think that.
Nobody could.

37:15.992 --> 37:17.993
He didn't.

37:18.027 --> 37:20.062
He thought it was a prop.

37:20.096 --> 37:23.031
He thought it was something that
I just made up just to cause trouble

37:23.066 --> 37:25.100
and be the center of attention.

37:25.635 --> 37:28.671
That's all he sees
when he looks at me.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.105
That's all
he's ever gonna see

37:30.140 --> 37:31.540
until we find out
what happened.

37:31.575 --> 37:34.977
Well, then, we'll
have to find out.

37:36.263 --> 37:38.948
Ali got up
and walked away.

37:38.982 --> 37:40.583
And then somewhere
between the kissing rock

37:40.617 --> 37:42.618
and her backyard,
somebody hit her.

37:42.702 --> 37:44.887
Now you're thinking they hit
her with your hockey stick?

37:44.921 --> 37:46.622
The paper said
that it was blunt force trauma,

37:46.657 --> 37:48.391
but they don't say
what was used.

37:48.425 --> 37:50.326
That's the stuff they never
give you in newspapers.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.527
The police hold back details

37:51.561 --> 37:54.363
so they won't have to deal
with a lot of crackpots.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.299
You think they know
what was used?

37:56.333 --> 37:58.601
Cops always know more
than they tell.

38:03.507 --> 38:05.608
He's never told anyone,
but he told me.

38:06.642 --> 38:07.543
Because he trusts you.

38:08.577 --> 38:09.545
You think so?

38:10.579 --> 38:11.547
Yes.

38:13.481 --> 38:16.385
So, you don't mind that I
tell you he told me this thing,

38:16.420 --> 38:18.454
but I can't tell
you what it is?

38:18.488 --> 38:22.291
I don't mind. I've got all
the secrets I need right now.

38:25.295 --> 38:26.562
Look, it'll be okay, Em.

38:26.896 --> 38:28.364
You'll do great
this year,

38:28.398 --> 38:30.299
and Danby will offer
you a scholarship,

38:30.334 --> 38:31.634
and your folks
will never find out.

38:32.168 --> 38:33.336
We'll make sure of it.

38:36.556 --> 38:37.573
I'm glad I'm here.

38:38.007 --> 38:39.575
So am I.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.610
And I'm glad Caleb
came back for you.

38:42.645 --> 38:46.549
Yeah. He came back for me.

38:46.583 --> 38:48.584
( Door opens )

38:48.618 --> 38:50.386
( Ashley and Tom giggling )

38:51.420 --> 38:52.521
Shh!

38:52.556 --> 38:54.523
( Whispering )

38:54.558 --> 38:56.559
( Giggling )

39:32.362 --> 39:34.363
Shh.

39:46.075 --> 39:47.610
Is your dad getting
back with your mom?

39:48.644 --> 39:49.578
( Sighs )

39:53.983 --> 39:54.983
You promised.

39:55.018 --> 39:56.318
Stay out of my room.

39:56.353 --> 39:57.521
Uhh!

39:57.823 --> 39:58.721
You took things
from Emily.

39:58.805 --> 40:01.390
You broke
into Spencer's house.

40:01.675 --> 40:03.509
You stole
from a blind girl!

40:03.543 --> 40:04.610
No, I didn't.

40:05.144 --> 40:07.513
This is from Jenna Marshall's.
She makes these.

40:07.547 --> 40:08.814
I don't care
what she makes.

40:09.348 --> 40:10.683
I didn't break
into that house.

40:11.417 --> 40:12.618
That candle thing
comes from

40:12.652 --> 40:14.586
an apartment over a
garage on Willoughby.

40:14.621 --> 40:17.556
- Whose apartment?
- Officer "mcfriendly".

40:18.590 --> 40:19.758
Garrett Reynolds?

40:20.793 --> 40:22.795
I was looking for maybe a gun
or something I could use

40:22.829 --> 40:24.530
to get away
from here.

40:24.564 --> 40:25.831
He's a cop,
and he's got

40:25.865 --> 40:27.009
crap like that
in his place.

40:27.134 --> 40:28.934
No, you're wrong.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.537
I thought it might be worth a
couple of bucks, so I took it.

40:31.571 --> 40:33.806
And a camera
and a GPS.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.510
This has to be
from Jenna Marshall's.

40:39.545 --> 40:40.713
I know what I stole,

40:41.247 --> 40:42.815
and I know where
I stole it from.

40:43.849 --> 40:45.818
I got that from Garrett
Reynolds' apartment.

40:50.790 --> 40:53.559
( Radio chatter )

40:53.593 --> 40:54.827
There you go.

40:54.861 --> 40:56.729
Thanks for letting
me see you.

40:56.763 --> 40:58.831
It sounded important
when you called.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.501
I have to ask
you something.

41:05.004 --> 41:07.139
Do the police know
what kind of weapon

41:07.173 --> 41:09.575
the killer used
on Alison?

41:09.909 --> 41:12.778
They never found the murder
weapon, Spencer, you know that.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.547
But do they know
what it might've been?

41:15.582 --> 41:17.750
It would all be
in the coroner's report.

41:18.084 --> 41:19.818
They can tell a lot
about a weapon

41:19.853 --> 41:21.787
by the kind of wound
it leaves.

41:22.621 --> 41:25.524
So, in the report it would say
what she was hit with,

41:25.558 --> 41:28.694
like, how big,
how hard, how sharp,

41:28.728 --> 41:30.002
if it was a man
or a woman that used it.

41:30.096 --> 41:33.365
Spencer, slow down.
It's like I said before.

41:33.399 --> 41:35.634
All of these loose ends,
they're not gonna change

41:35.668 --> 41:36.802
the main fact:

41:36.836 --> 41:38.804
It was Ian,
and he's gone.

41:39.838 --> 41:40.639
( Sighs )

41:40.673 --> 41:42.508
You need
to take that in.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.576
Ali's killer
is dead.

41:45.745 --> 41:47.846
I'm not so sure.

41:49.581 --> 41:50.516
Why not?

41:52.151 --> 41:54.720
