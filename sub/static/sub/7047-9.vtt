WEBVTT

00:02.044 --> 00:03.711
Previously on Justified...

00:03.796 --> 00:05.380
I need you to run some names.

00:05.464 --> 00:08.257
You know it's against the law for me
to run names for a civilian?

00:09.301 --> 00:10.510
My name is Wynn Duffy.

00:10.594 --> 00:13.471
I could call the police right now
if you don't get out of my house!

00:13.555 --> 00:15.682
Mrs. Hawkins, you haven't asked me
to get out of your house.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.642
You know why I didn't call the cops?

00:17.726 --> 00:19.435
'Cause I know you're into something
with some bad people,

00:19.520 --> 00:22.021
and I know that this Duffy guy,
he's one of them.

00:22.106 --> 00:23.898
How do you know something that isn't true?

00:23.982 --> 00:25.775
Because I read your emails,
and I found some names.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.694
I wasn't ever thinking of shooting you...

00:27.778 --> 00:32.490
But you drag her down into any of the shit
you've got going on now, different story.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.534
You shot somebody else? At her house?

00:34.618 --> 00:37.495
Well, Vasquez is gonna have a field day
with this one, isn't he?

00:42.292 --> 00:46.129
- Here's to getting laid off!
- That's what she said.

00:46.672 --> 00:50.717
- I'm assuming you're not gonna stop now.
- I don't see one good reason why I should.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.677
'Cause she's a worthless whore!

00:53.053 --> 00:54.387
Don't think I seen you in here before.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.432
Normally, my work keeps me busy,

00:57.516 --> 01:01.227
but I am on what I've been told
is a well-earned vacation.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.104
Nurse! Little help!

01:03.814 --> 01:08.443
Come on. My latest side dish,
she ain't no more than a lonely housewife.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.653
I show up, I make her squeal!

01:12.531 --> 01:14.949
- She's the one with them kids, right?
- Hell, yeah.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.993
How do you think I knew she liked to screw?

01:17.202 --> 01:19.203
I mean, and the thing is,
when you're done with her,

01:19.455 --> 01:20.997
you can always play with them!

01:22.332 --> 01:26.335
Gentlemen? Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.506
Could you just keep it down a little bit?

01:33.510 --> 01:35.011
Why would we do that?

01:36.180 --> 01:38.890
Because I didn't order assholes
with my whiskey.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.519
What did you say?

01:44.188 --> 01:48.191
Any woman who is merciful enough
to allow you into her bed

01:48.358 --> 01:51.402
deserves better than to be
insulted behind her back.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.947
So why don't you stop trying so hard
to impress your friend,

01:55.532 --> 01:58.701
drink your drink, and we'll be just fine?

01:59.536 --> 02:02.371
You seem to be harboring
a bit of hostility there, brother.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.541
So I've been told.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.215
Last I checked, it was a free country.

02:13.050 --> 02:16.052
- I'm meeting someone here.
- I really don't give a shit.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.431
- Well, then I guess we're at an impasse.
- Then I guess I suppose we are.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.809
Hey, hey, hey. There's no need for this.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.603
Now, why don't everybody
just take a calm breath?

02:25.771 --> 02:28.731
Come on.
Let's all have a round on the house.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.567
There's two of us and one of you.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.821
Do you like them odds?

02:35.614 --> 02:37.114
I'm good if you are.

02:45.916 --> 02:49.168
You better not call the law
after we tune you up.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.171
That's not what I'd be worried about
if I were you.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.997
I think that'll about do it.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.959
I don't want no hard feelings,
you boys are good customers,

03:30.294 --> 03:33.045
and that's why I ain't pointing this
at nobody in particular,

03:33.297 --> 03:36.841
but I can't let you beat a man
to death out back of my place.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.635
Wasn't gonna kill him.
Just give him what's coming.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.138
Looks to me like
he's already had that and more.

03:43.891 --> 03:48.227
You, don't come back here again.
You hear me, faggot?

03:56.820 --> 03:59.906
Oh, yeah! Sweet.

04:03.660 --> 04:08.372
Raylan? Raylan!
Raylan, what in God's name did you do?

04:08.874 --> 04:09.916
You're late.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.335
Get up. Come on.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.829
Yeah, but you couldn't keep your mouth
shut for two more minutes, could you?

04:48.914 --> 04:52.083
They were insulting
the honor of a young lady.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.047
Your maid refusing to clean up after you?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.051
Maybe she's on vacation, too.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.762
Yeah, I ran into Art at the courthouse,
and he told me

05:04.888 --> 05:07.932
that he not so subtly suggested
you take the week off.

05:08.058 --> 05:12.061
Apparently, Internal Affairs
wants to roast me on a spit!

05:13.730 --> 05:15.898
Well, he's concerned about you.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.317
He said that?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.069
I intuited it.

05:22.072 --> 05:26.993
Is that why you wanted to meet with me?
Because you're concerned as well?

05:29.621 --> 05:30.913
Wynn Duffy came to see me.

05:31.915 --> 05:36.085
- Wynn Duffy. How do I know that name?
- He was on that list I gave you.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.422
I came home, and he was
just sitting at my kitchen table.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.426
- He broke in?
- Well, he came in.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.678
- I can't say as I saw anything broken.
- He threaten you?

05:45.762 --> 05:49.348
Not directly. He said he was a security
consultant, that Gary had hired him.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.599
Well, what did Gary say?

05:51.226 --> 05:54.979
Well, Gary played dumb
and he accused me of being a snoop.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.481
He also mentioned
that you came by to see him,

05:58.066 --> 05:59.650
put some fear into him.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.278
Why did you go and see him, Raylan?

06:02.487 --> 06:04.572
If the names on that list were clean,
why did you go see Gary?

06:05.449 --> 06:06.615
We've been...

06:07.451 --> 06:11.120
We were married six years, Winona,

06:11.413 --> 06:15.124
and in that time,
your instincts were not often wrong.

06:15.292 --> 06:19.712
So, if you tell me there's a problem,
then I figure there's a problem.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.174
And you just assumed that problem
had to do with my new husband.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.135
Well, I intuited it.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.804
Oh, my God.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.975
Why don't you just tell me why you think
Wynn Duffy was in your house?

06:33.268 --> 06:34.351
I don't know.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.645
I don't know. I mean,
Gary has this development deal

06:36.980 --> 06:40.191
with some land he bought a while back,
so my guess is if he's in trouble,

06:40.817 --> 06:42.818
it's got to have something
to do with that, right?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.321
Tough time to be developing.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.991
If you're thinking about going
back to talk to Gary, please, don't.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.201
My home life is strange enough

06:50.327 --> 06:52.203
without my ex-husband going
and badgering my new husband.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.163
Good, I wasn't gonna.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.124
The thing to do now
is go to Wynn Duffy's place.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.835
Just have a peaceful chat.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.670
You think you're capable of that?

07:02.380 --> 07:05.716
Right now, I think that's all I'm capable of.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.387
You're a little old to be fighting, aren't you?

07:11.389 --> 07:13.182
Certainly too old to be losing.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.400
All right.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.361
Thank you, Raylan.

07:27.739 --> 07:28.823
You're a good man.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.200
Not good enough.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.720
- Sweetie?
- I like the taste of that.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.389
- Baby.
- Hey.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.890
Look who I found.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.519
- I'll be damned.
- How are you, Toby?

07:58.603 --> 08:03.357
- Hey, baby. What's happening, huh?
- Not too much. Not too much.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.775
- You look like a million bucks.
- Yeah, you, too.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.444
Hey, ladies, ladies, ladies.
Say hello to Mr. Gary.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.656
- Hello, girls. So big.
- Yeah, they getting big.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.117
I'm about to put some pads on them,
send them out there on the field.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.702
Our girls are not playing
football on my watch.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.454
I'm gonna have to put my wife
in some pads and tackle her.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.248
Why don't you two go inside and catch up?

08:19.374 --> 08:20.958
There's wine and cheese
in the fridge, if you'd like.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.418
Don't drink all the tea, now.

08:23.753 --> 08:27.590
We're gonna save that wine and cheese
for Amanda's book club, yep.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.801
I still can't get over this place.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.929
I think back to U. K.,
when you were T-Bone Griffin,

08:34.054 --> 08:37.933
and I never thought I'd see the day
when you had the wife, the kids, the yard.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.059
We all got to grow up some time, right?

08:42.230 --> 08:44.899
- Let me look at that thing again.
- What, this right here?

08:44.983 --> 08:47.151
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.321
- Don't hurt yourself, now.
- Look at that. Goodness. Look at that.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.615
Worst day of my life, too.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.202
Sitting on the sidelines in my street clothes
when they won that thing.

08:56.286 --> 09:00.623
- Yeah. Hey, how is the knee?
- Knee's fine for playing with the girls.

09:00.916 --> 09:04.960
I had a good run.
Got the house, got the ring.

09:05.587 --> 09:09.131
- You got wine and cheese in the fridge.
- Wine and cheese in the fridge.

09:12.302 --> 09:16.639
Well, listen, Toby, good as it is to see you,
this isn't just a social call.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.474
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.143
So, you a Jehovah Witness now?

09:21.353 --> 09:25.105
No, no. No. Actually, I got
an investment opportunity for you.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.273
Is that right?

09:26.358 --> 09:29.151
Shopping center we're gonna be
breaking ground on in the fall.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.070
Looking for additional financing.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.323
So if you haven't blown all that NFL money
on strippers and blow,

09:34.407 --> 09:37.576
I got some plans outside
in the car I'd love to show you.

09:37.661 --> 09:41.622
Gary, do you remember when you slept
with Debbie Reynolds in my bed?

09:42.290 --> 09:46.502
I came home from practice, and you had
that look you have on your face right now,

09:46.795 --> 09:48.003
knowing you messed up.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.839
Now, whose bed you sleeping in?

09:54.094 --> 09:57.179
I mean, everything was booming, okay?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.765
Through the roof. I mean,
you couldn't sell houses fast enough.

09:59.849 --> 10:03.852
And this land came up,
and I did my homework.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.354
I mean, the numbers looked good.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.189
And the bottom fell out.

10:07.691 --> 10:12.695
Yeah, I got overextended and took some
money from people I shouldn't have,

10:12.821 --> 10:14.697
and I'm in a tough spot.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.784
- Talking about a bank?
- No, it's a private investor.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.287
How much money you talking?

10:22.664 --> 10:24.456
- A lot.
- Six figures?

10:24.541 --> 10:25.708
Almost seven.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.129
Now, you know I can't do nothing for you.

10:30.213 --> 10:33.507
Not with this mortgage,
my ex-wife, this wife, the kids.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.384
You know I got to take care of mine.

10:35.510 --> 10:39.388
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I hear you. It's okay,
you know? I'll figure something out.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.562
What kind of pressure they putting on you?

10:47.564 --> 10:52.026
They came by the house when I wasn't home
and threatened my wife.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.362
I mean, I just...
I don't know what they're capable of.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.367
Well, I tell you what.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.828
This is what I could do for you.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.915
I can go down to that office with you,
push them back a little bit,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.167
and buy you some time.

11:11.588 --> 11:15.007
Well, I appreciate the offer, Toby,
but that's not why I came over here.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.094
Come on, now.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.349
You know I miss being the baddest guy
on the field sometimes.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.601
And when else I get to be T-Bone?

11:27.437 --> 11:28.562
Book club?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.627
Gentlemen, afternoon.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.087
Afternoon. Can we help you?

11:53.380 --> 11:54.755
I sure hope so.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.800
I understand you two
are in the security business,

11:57.926 --> 12:00.719
and as you can see, I sure could use some.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.724
We can talk about that,
but first I need to know who you are

12:05.809 --> 12:07.142
and who referred you.

12:07.602 --> 12:11.480
I'm Raylan. And I was referred to you
by a friend of mine,

12:12.065 --> 12:13.816
guy name of Gary Hawkins.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.446
Well, I'm afraid you've been misinformed,
but thank you for your interest, Mr. Raylan.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.158
That's not much of a sales pitch.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.743
Well...

12:29.082 --> 12:30.999
Well, what do you guys do here, then?

12:32.669 --> 12:36.505
It's hard to tell, looking around.
All I really see is lead paint and dust mites.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.675
Man asked you to leave.
I suggest that's what you do.

12:41.010 --> 12:45.514
Oh, I see. You guys can go into
people's homes and threaten them,

12:45.598 --> 12:47.599
but we can't have a peaceful conversation.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.477
All right, take it easy.
I already got one ass-kicking.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.354
I'm not looking for another.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.691
I just want to know
how you two are involved with Gary.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.527
Well, if you're so curious,
why don't you just go ask Gary?

12:58.695 --> 13:01.113
Yeah, I did that.
He was reluctant to talk about it.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.032
Well, then, maybe that's an answer
in itself, huh, Mr. Raylan?

13:06.161 --> 13:07.202
Maybe it is.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.704
It's time to go now.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.374
Yeah. I suppose you're right.

13:16.546 --> 13:21.967
I'm just gonna say one last thing, and then
hopefully we'll never see each other again.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.804
It's gonna take me a day, maybe two,
to figure this whole thing out.

13:25.889 --> 13:30.058
In the meantime, either of you go near
Gary or his wife, I'll come back here

13:30.185 --> 13:33.187
and upend your entire existence.
Is that understood?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.898
Thank you, Mr. Raylan.
Your point is well stated.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.358
Perfect.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.282
Follow him. Find out who he is and how
he's connected with Gary and Winona,

13:45.366 --> 13:46.825
and then put him in the ground.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.210
These aren't the old days, Duffy.
These contracts are legitimate.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.837
I agree, Mr. Arnett. You know
I have your best interest at heart,

13:58.922 --> 14:02.257
but a Federal Marshal walked
into my office and threatened me.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.301
Hold on, Duffy. Yeah?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.347
Baby, baby, come on over here.
We'll take care of that.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.558
- Duffy, you still there?
- Yeah. What would you like me to do, sir?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.479
Well, go to Gary, remind him clearly
and simply of his obligations.

14:16.439 --> 14:19.608
Goddamn. Easy, girl. It ain't a contest.
You know what I mean?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.360
Sorry, Duffy. What was I saying?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.362
- Remind Gary of his obligations.
- Right.

14:23.571 --> 14:26.448
Remind him, and I'm sure
he'll see things our way.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.995
- Mr. Arnett, could I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.457
Are you getting a blowjob
in your office right now?

14:38.753 --> 14:40.170
I'm gonna call you back.

14:42.632 --> 14:47.177
Mr. Hawkins, I was just talking about you.
And you've brought a friend.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.097
- Duffy, how are you?
- I'm okay.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.474
I'm okay. It's been a busy day.

14:52.642 --> 14:56.186
Yeah, your...
A friend of yours stopped by, a Mr. Raylan.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.314
Seemed very concerned about you
and your lovely wife.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.817
- Raylan came by?
- Yeah! Came right by the office.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.654
Fancies himself a bit of
a tough guy, doesn't he?

15:07.657 --> 15:09.866
Hey, Gary? I got to tell you,

15:10.451 --> 15:13.328
all I really care about is getting the money.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.873
All these little visits to the office,
they're getting pretty tiresome.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.960
- Yeah, well, that's what I came by to discuss.
- Great.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.838
Okay. You know,
I appreciate our arrangement,

15:23.089 --> 15:27.092
and I fully intend to uphold my end of it,

15:27.760 --> 15:30.804
but Arnett made an investment,
and an investment,

15:30.888 --> 15:34.016
I don't have to tell you,
comes with certain risks.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.977
You look so familiar. Have we met?

15:37.353 --> 15:39.563
Don't even worry about me.
Pay attention to the man.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.232
Okay. Sure.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.277
Gary, you were saying?

15:45.445 --> 15:49.072
Yeah, I was just saying that all of your
boss's money is tied up in this property,

15:49.157 --> 15:52.326
and the property isn't worth
half of what it once was.

15:53.494 --> 15:57.706
So you're saying selling the property now
would be a poor business decision.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.375
Yes! Yes, that's exactly it, you know?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.961
And the market is starting
to turn around, okay?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.922
So we wait a few years,
get this construction underway,

16:06.507 --> 16:07.716
we are gonna be rolling.

16:11.846 --> 16:15.182
This is driving me crazy.
Are you sure we haven't met?

16:15.266 --> 16:16.475
You don't want to know me.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.101
- Now, look, I...
- So familiar.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.646
Gary, Gary, Gary, I got this.
I got this one. Gary, I got this one.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.272
Now, let me tell you something.

16:22.357 --> 16:26.276
You tell your boss his money's
not available at this time, okay?

16:27.028 --> 16:30.781
If he needs to talk to Gary,
you tell him to pick up the phone and call.

16:31.366 --> 16:36.203
In the meantime, do not harass this man,
and you leave his wife alone.

16:36.287 --> 16:39.414
Do you understand?

16:39.791 --> 16:42.876
Well, that hardly seems fair.
I was very nice to Gary's wife.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.337
Yes, and all I'm saying is

16:45.421 --> 16:47.464
that I could probably get
your boss's money for him tomorrow...

16:47.548 --> 16:49.508
Gary, you can't do that. You can't do that...

16:49.592 --> 16:54.721
Or I can get him double his money
in 24 months.

17:02.355 --> 17:06.316
Listen, I don't know how you're associated
with Mr. Hawkins, or why,

17:06.401 --> 17:10.362
but I'm gonna give you this opportunity
to extricate yourself from his predicament

17:10.445 --> 17:12.698
before you get involved in something that,

17:13.532 --> 17:16.076
quite frankly,
you don't want to be involved in.

17:16.243 --> 17:19.788
And I'm gonna give you a minute
to extricate yourself up out my face

17:20.832 --> 17:23.333
before I have to paint your office
with your shit.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.510
Okay. I'll go to Mr. Arnett,
and I'll tell him everything you just told me.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.137
That's exactly what you're gonna do.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.514
Okay. All right.
Well, just ask him to think about it.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.641
Ain't nothing to think about, Gary. Come on.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.770
- Go on, now.
- All right.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.378
That's a good one.

18:08.629 --> 18:12.215
Hey. Glad to see you up and around, man.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.052
- Wasn't sure how bad those guys got to you.
- Nothing that won't heal.

18:17.430 --> 18:21.183
All the same, it might be best
if you didn't saddle up here today.

18:21.392 --> 18:25.312
Listen, I ain't looking for more trouble.
Don't even want to get back at those men.

18:25.396 --> 18:29.483
Lord knows I was asking for it,
but I had a hat on

18:29.567 --> 18:31.943
that I've grown pretty fond of.
I'd like to get it back.

18:32.570 --> 18:33.653
I didn't find your hat.

18:33.738 --> 18:37.699
Yeah, well, if those guys show up
or if it just turns up,

18:37.825 --> 18:39.534
I'd appreciate you giving me a call.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.543
Well, Marshal, I don't mean to be rude,

18:48.628 --> 18:52.631
but wouldn't it be easier
just to go and buy yourself a new hat?

18:52.882 --> 18:53.924
Probably.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.967
But it ain't easier I'm after.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.929
I appreciate it.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.858
Damn, Raylan. How'd the other girl look?

19:12.568 --> 19:17.322
- Better. What happened with Tahiti?
- It ain't like the postcard.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.116
Mosquitoes eating at you,
everyone's talking French.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.619
There's only one movie theater.
I'm better off here.

19:24.038 --> 19:29.793
Lovely Gale! Meet my friend, Ray... Ray.
Ray Ray, the lovely Gale.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.046
It's nice to meet you, Ray Ray.
Can I get you anything?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.674
- I'm fine. Thank you.
- Just the check, sweetheart.

19:37.218 --> 19:41.304
I tell you what. That girl needs
to be ridden hard and put away wet.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.934
Well, I'm sure an ex-con-turned-informant
is just what she's looking for.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.770
- You, Raylan, are a hater.
- Why am I here, Pinter?

19:49.063 --> 19:51.398
I asked around about
your Wynn Duffy. Guy's crazy.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.567
He's too mercurial to run his own show.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.485
Basically, he ends up
working as a middle man.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.405
"Mercurial." Someone's been
reading the dictionary.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.074
- Bite me.
- Any idea who he's working for?

20:01.284 --> 20:04.327
Word has it that he's backing
Emmitt Arnett. You know him?

20:04.537 --> 20:07.080
By reputation. Your sources are reliable?

20:07.373 --> 20:08.874
As a Kentucky greyhound.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.421
Arnett's a street hustler.
What's he doing handing out bridge loans?

20:14.839 --> 20:16.172
When the economy turned,

20:16.257 --> 20:18.425
he realized that he could be taking
people's money legitimately.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.511
Cash loans, high interest, no questions.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.806
Plenty of people these days
looking for a lifeboat.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.726
Anyway, in the end,
when they can't pay it back,

20:27.810 --> 20:29.185
he'll take all their money and more.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.314
- Yeah, I know the scam.
- Listen, Arnett's no picnic,

20:32.565 --> 20:34.983
but this guy Duffy and Billy Mac,

20:35.902 --> 20:37.444
they're your real wild cards.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.281
I heard last year, guy wouldn't pay,
they found his brother,

20:41.365 --> 20:43.116
cut his face off, sewed it onto a soccer ball.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.119
- You're joking.
- That's what I heard!

20:46.495 --> 20:48.330
There you go, boys. No rush, now.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.082
Thank you so much, sweetheart.

20:52.835 --> 20:56.212
Tip her well, would you?
No man ever got laid being stingy.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.633
Best tip I could give her, stay away from you.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.343
Hater, through and through.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.512
Hey, don't you usually wear an
obnoxious hat of some sort?

21:25.409 --> 21:27.410
Hey, baby, y'all finished early, huh?

21:29.914 --> 21:31.456
You should lock your doors, Toby.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.711
It was driving me crazy,
trying to figure out how I knew you.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.130
Then it hit me.

21:39.382 --> 21:44.469
Toby Griffin, U. K.'s all-time lead tackler
and a Super Bowl champion.

21:45.721 --> 21:49.766
Listen, now, I was just trying to
help out a friend, okay?

21:51.060 --> 21:53.269
Now, y'all go on
and leave my family out of this.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.439
Well, you had your chance
to walk away, Toby.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.108
You should have taken it.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.153
So, what, y'all gonna shoot me
in my own kitchen?

22:02.238 --> 22:04.155
Actually, Billy Mac here has
been itching to have a go.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.908
See, Billy, here

22:07.952 --> 22:11.079
was quite a promising featherweight
in his day, but he got hurt, too.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.288
Not unlike you did.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.917
So you want a piece of Toby Griffin, huh?

22:17.253 --> 22:18.920
You want a story to tell your friends?

22:20.089 --> 22:22.132
You know what my favorite part
of boxing was?

22:23.092 --> 22:25.301
Getting paid to beat up
on all the colored boys.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.445
Looks like Billy's still got it.

22:46.198 --> 22:51.828
No pads here, Toby.
No referee to blow that whistle for you.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.308
- You working late?
- Yes, that's right. You talk to Arnett?

23:13.476 --> 23:15.310
- I did.
- And?

23:17.855 --> 23:22.233
I would describe his attitude
towards your suggestions as unreceptive.

23:22.693 --> 23:25.820
For a supposedly smart guy, Gary,
you're making some bad decisions.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.655
Bringing Toby into this, for example.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.992
- Toby?
- Yeah, it took me a minute,

23:31.077 --> 23:32.994
but I finally figured out how I knew him.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.164
Hell of a player. Shame about his knee.

23:39.710 --> 23:42.670
Did you honestly think that
Arnett would just lay down?

23:43.756 --> 23:47.092
Get the money by tomorrow morning
at 9:00 a.m., including interest.

23:49.178 --> 23:52.597
Find a way,
or the next ring will be your wife's.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.589
It's a nice place.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.633
What do you want?

24:28.968 --> 24:30.593
What is that smell?

24:31.554 --> 24:34.222
You got a dead cat in here or something?

24:34.557 --> 24:36.432
You ain't gonna be smiling
when I knock your teeth out.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.769
You gonna bob and weave
out of the path of a bullet?

24:39.895 --> 24:42.105
'Cause that I'd like to see. Sit down.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.482
How'd you find out where I live?

24:44.650 --> 24:47.068
Well, that was easy.
I just asked everyone I saw

24:47.153 --> 24:50.155
where the dumbest broken-down,
never-was boxer in all of Kentucky lived,

24:50.239 --> 24:53.408
- and they all told me to come here.
- Okay, what the hell do you want?

24:53.576 --> 24:55.785
I want you to tell me
what Duffy has planned for Gary.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.412
Well, why don't you go ask Duffy?
I just take orders.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.082
If I wanted to ask Duffy,
I'd have his gun pointed at him.

25:03.419 --> 25:07.297
All right. You want to know what
we're gonna do to Gary and your ex-wife?

25:09.258 --> 25:12.343
Yeah. We's not so stupid
as you thought, huh?

25:12.928 --> 25:14.512
I know why you care about that dumb bitch.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.973
Disrespect her again,
I'll put a hole in your leg.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.934
From what I understand, she filed
for divorce, which means she left you.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.813
Someone said they were gonna whoop
on my ex-wife, I'd probably thank them.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.773
Well, that's awfully compassionate
of you, Billy Mac.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.942
Why'd yours leave you, lawman?

25:28.444 --> 25:29.861
Sight of your gun not turn her on anymore?

25:30.362 --> 25:32.280
I don't know. You'd have to ask her.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.865
I just might do that.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.619
Tell me what Duffy has planned.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.123
- Jesus Christ!
- Now.

25:42.791 --> 25:43.958
We was gonna take her.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.376
What do you mean?

25:45.461 --> 25:48.004
In case Gary didn't show with the money,
we was gonna kidnap the missus,

25:48.130 --> 25:49.172
use her to force Gary's hand.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.798
When?

25:51.300 --> 25:55.053
- Son of a...
- Billy, the next one is for you.

25:57.973 --> 26:02.018
Tonight. I was supposed to have her
over at Duffy's in an hour,

26:02.144 --> 26:04.395
but he said he wanted me to stop off
and pick up some trash bags.

26:04.647 --> 26:06.481
Trash bags? What the hell for?

26:08.525 --> 26:09.651
Duffy's crazy.

26:12.655 --> 26:13.738
You know what, Billy Mac?

26:13.822 --> 26:16.991
Just because you can't box and you're
stupid don't mean you got to end up dead.

26:19.203 --> 26:22.747
Doesn't matter if I'm dead or alive.
You're not gonna stop Duffy.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.043
Hey, this is Gary. I'm not in right now.
Please leave me a message,

26:27.169 --> 26:29.087
- and I'll call you right back.
- Gary...

26:36.220 --> 26:39.055
- Raylan?
- Winona, I've been calling you. You all right?

26:39.181 --> 26:41.182
- Yeah, I'm fine. What's going on?
- Where are you?

26:41.392 --> 26:43.059
- I'm at home.
- Gary with you?

26:43.519 --> 26:44.894
No. I don't... I don't know where he is.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.022
All right, listen to me. You need to get
your gun and get out of that house.

26:48.274 --> 26:51.276
- Raylan, what is going on?
- Okay, you're not safe there.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.237
Take the gun and come and meet me,
and I'll explain everything.

26:54.530 --> 26:55.571
I can't do that.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.657
- Why not?
- Because the gun's not here.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.033
Gary must have taken it with him.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.952
Okay, you're not safe there.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.329
I need you to meet me
at that café on Route 29.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.373
- I can be there in about...
- No, I'm not gonna do that.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.042
Winona, this is not a joke.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.419
God damn it, Raylan!

27:09.545 --> 27:12.922
I am not leaving this house until somebody
tells me what the hell is going on!

27:13.215 --> 27:16.592
All right, well, just lock the doors,
and I'll be there as soon as I can.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.094
Fine!

27:31.400 --> 27:32.984
You have got a lot of nerve
coming back to this house.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.235
I'm so sorry.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.237
Damn right you're sorry.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.156
Now, I want you to turn
your sorry butt around

27:38.407 --> 27:39.782
and do whatever you have to do
to make this right.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.909
- You understand me, Gary?
- Baby. Baby, come on, now.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.163
- It's cool.
- Jesus, Toby.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.248
Come on, now, baby, give us a minute.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.962
- I'm so sorry. Are the girls all right?
- Everybody's okay.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.424
- Except you.
- I'm gonna be fine.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.469
- Obviously they came after you, too, huh?
- Yeah.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.430
I don't know what you're gonna do, Gary,
but you're on your own now.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.768
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know, either,

28:08.145 --> 28:11.939
but those men will never be back here again.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.276
Go on, now.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.111
Right. Toby,

28:21.992 --> 28:24.327
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.045
Go on, now.

28:50.521 --> 28:52.480
Tell me what's going on, right now!

28:53.023 --> 28:55.858
It's old Dixie Mafia.
They primarily operate out of Frankfurt.

28:55.984 --> 28:59.487
They're very dangerous people
and Gary is deep underwater with them.

28:59.822 --> 29:01.864
I can't believe this is happening.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.992
He's a realtor, for Christ's sake!

29:06.161 --> 29:07.829
Is he still not answering his cell phone?

29:07.913 --> 29:10.289
No, it's going straight to voicemail.
Can't you... I don't know.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.709
- Can't you track the signal or something?
- Not if he doesn't answer.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.881
Okay, look,

29:21.718 --> 29:24.178
I got to get you out of this house.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.685
You really think that these men might...

29:32.104 --> 29:33.688
Might kill him?

29:34.356 --> 29:36.023
Not just him.

29:37.860 --> 29:40.194
Okay. Oh, God.

29:43.532 --> 29:46.534
Okay, I am begging you, Raylan.
I am begging you.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.871
If you care about me at all,
just, please, just go help him.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.709
Winona, you know me.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.004
Honestly, you think I'm gonna
let you stay in this house

29:58.088 --> 30:00.214
if I go out there looking for Gary?

30:00.716 --> 30:01.924
No.

30:02.050 --> 30:05.386
Then come with me.
Let me take you someplace safe,

30:05.721 --> 30:08.222
and then I will go find him.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.228
Deal?

30:18.442 --> 30:19.567
Deal.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.662
Now, assuming he's not
foolish enough to go see Duffy,

30:31.747 --> 30:33.831
I need you to think about where he might be.

30:36.126 --> 30:40.588
This must make you feel so good,
Gary screwing up like this.

30:42.633 --> 30:43.966
No, I ain't here to gloat.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.094
Gary.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.806
He's always been such a dreamer.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.352
He's always had these grand plans.

30:55.103 --> 30:58.439
Well, he made his choice.
I can't do anything about that.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.609
All I can do now is make sure
his bad choices don't get you hurt.

31:07.616 --> 31:11.786
Raylan, you asked me once, "Why him?"

31:13.789 --> 31:15.039
That's why.

31:15.791 --> 31:20.628
It's not that I liked him more
or thought he was smarter or better-looking.

31:20.712 --> 31:24.340
It's that he wants things.

31:25.676 --> 31:30.972
And he's genuinely excited about life
and about its prospects.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.057
Yeah. How's that working out for you?

31:33.392 --> 31:35.643
Oh, God, I thought you said
you weren't gonna gloat.

31:36.812 --> 31:39.480
And I thought you were a smart,
pragmatic woman.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.818
You know what, Raylan?
Your grind is exhausting.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.156
I don't know how you shoulder it,
'cause I sure couldn't do it anymore.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.034
I needed a little hope in my life.

31:55.497 --> 31:58.541
And as ridiculous as this might
sound to you right now, I love him.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.420
We built a life together,

32:02.504 --> 32:05.506
and it's a really good life
that I would like to continue.

32:09.386 --> 32:11.012
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get him back.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.014
Okay. Thank you.

32:27.696 --> 32:28.946
Who's there?

32:31.033 --> 32:32.617
It's Raylan, Gary!

32:33.201 --> 32:36.621
Raylan? You're not wearing your hat.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.957
Will you put the gun away?

32:41.585 --> 32:43.210
Well, I can't do that, Marshal.

32:44.212 --> 32:47.214
I don't see how killing me
is gonna solve your problems,

32:48.216 --> 32:50.885
- and I'm the only one out here.
- No, you're not.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.392
You're really gonna do that?

32:58.769 --> 33:02.146
Well, I thought you knew, Marshal Givens,
I'm worth more dead than alive.

33:02.564 --> 33:03.814
How you figure that?

33:04.483 --> 33:07.234
I figure I kill myself,
at least Winona gets the insurance.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.945
Oh, my God, Gary.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.156
If that's what you're after,
you best give me the gun.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.075
I'll do it myself.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.244
Now you're gonna shoot me?
On my vacation?

33:19.581 --> 33:20.831
What happened to your face?

33:23.418 --> 33:24.710
Nothing. Don't worry about that.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.462
Well, what, they do that because of me, too?

33:26.630 --> 33:29.298
No, Gary. This is my doing.

33:30.092 --> 33:34.929
Now you listen to me.
Any asshole knows that you kill yourself,

33:35.013 --> 33:38.683
you negate the coverage. Winona will be
worse off than she already is.

33:39.601 --> 33:42.603
So you tell me, is that what you want?

33:45.440 --> 33:46.524
God damn it!

33:47.859 --> 33:51.028
All I tried to do is make this better,
and I just keep making it worse and worse!

33:51.113 --> 33:53.280
I'm such a freaking loser!

33:53.699 --> 33:54.782
What, is that funny?

33:56.702 --> 33:58.327
No, it's not. It's just...

34:00.163 --> 34:01.789
Can you put that away?

34:02.290 --> 34:03.791
Sorry.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.961
It was gonna be a mall, was it?

34:09.339 --> 34:11.340
A shopping destination.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.134
Tell me about it.

34:14.511 --> 34:17.972
- What, now?
- Yeah! We're here, aren't we?

34:20.851 --> 34:24.353
Gary, pitch it to me
before one of us kills you.

34:28.483 --> 34:32.152
Shopping and restaurants.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.739
A 10-screen movie theater.
We got horse stables for the kids.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.868
I mean, it was... It was true Kentucky,
through and through.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.202
Nothing like it anywhere.

34:40.579 --> 34:46.375
And this whole layout is Feng Shui.
It's designed to encourage spending.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.043
- So it'd be outdoors.
- Yeah.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.339
Well, what do you do during winter?

34:52.882 --> 34:54.675
That's gonna be the best part.

34:55.010 --> 34:58.637
Yeah, we're gonna tent the walkways,
use hanging space heaters,

34:58.722 --> 35:01.682
and then we're gonna string lights
all through those trees.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.811
And we've got horse-drawn carriage rides
through the main drag, here.

35:05.896 --> 35:07.396
And at Christmastime,

35:07.522 --> 35:10.566
we got Santa's workshop
right up there on the north end.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.361
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

35:14.696 --> 35:17.948
Thank you. Thank you, Raylan.
I do appreciate that.

35:19.910 --> 35:21.368
But it ain't worth dying over.

35:22.204 --> 35:23.370
Yeah.

35:29.711 --> 35:32.213
I'll go with you, if you want me to.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.262
This what you do on your vacation?

35:40.722 --> 35:42.056
Apparently Tahiti sucks.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.105
Right there in the office?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.150
And you pay her?

35:53.235 --> 35:56.445
Well, not for the head so much
as to leave when she's done.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.282
Now, if you were gonna place
some odds on our boy Gary

36:00.408 --> 36:02.660
showing up here,
what would you set them at?

36:02.744 --> 36:05.579
- I'd probably put that at 3-to-1.
- I think I'll take that bet.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.582
Odds he shows up
with what you want, 7-to-1.

36:09.876 --> 36:13.254
Disappointing odds.
Guy's got his pride, huh?

36:13.797 --> 36:15.422
Not only that, he thinks
he's smarter than we are.

36:15.549 --> 36:18.133
- But he's not, is he?
- No, he's not.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.971
- How about the odds he shows up alone?
- Zero.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.104
You two are quite a pair.

36:30.272 --> 36:33.566
- Gonna have to search you, gentlemen.
- Disappointed to see you here, Billy Mac.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.110
- Did you find that cat?
- You owe me a gun.

36:36.444 --> 36:39.613
Yeah, well, you find one on me,
you're welcome to it.

36:39.739 --> 36:43.409
- You must be Emmitt Arnett.
- That's correct. Nice to meet you, Marshal.

36:43.493 --> 36:44.785
Gary,

36:46.329 --> 36:47.955
I was kind of hoping
you were gonna bring cash with you,

36:48.081 --> 36:53.127
seeing how that's what I gave you,
but I suppose a cashier's check will suffice.

36:53.628 --> 36:54.962
I don't have the money, Mr. Arnett.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.674
What do you suggest we do about that?

37:03.847 --> 37:06.640
Inside is a notary-signed letter
forfeiting the property to you.

37:07.475 --> 37:11.103
It's currently appraised at
right around what I owe you,

37:11.354 --> 37:14.815
but you wait a few years,
it'll be worth a lot more.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.652
You contact my broker,
he'll set the escrow in motion.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.822
You're not seriously considering this.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.616
It's all I have, Mr. Arnett.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.118
I mean, if you don't want this land,
you might as well kill me now.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.455
- Careful what you wish for, Gary.
- It's all right. I think he is gonna take it.

37:29.664 --> 37:32.416
In fact, I think that's what
he's wanted all along.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.210
And killing us just leaves
blood for him to clean up

37:35.337 --> 37:36.503
and cops sniffing around.

37:36.963 --> 37:40.674
You don't want that
if you're a legitimate businessman.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.015
I will take the land.

37:48.308 --> 37:51.518
What are you doing?
What are you, a developer now?

37:51.686 --> 37:53.354
Well, just maybe I am.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.357
- Actually, I hear now is a good time to buy.
- What are you, his realtor?

37:56.524 --> 37:59.026
- No, he's right. I mean, now is a great time...
- Shut up, Gary!

38:01.863 --> 38:03.155
We have been laboring
under the impression

38:03.239 --> 38:06.408
that you were gonna pay us
with a portion of the recovered money.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.826
- And I will.
- So pay me.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.537
Anyway, if we're good here,
Gary and I are gonna go ahead and take off.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.915
- Don't you two move.
- Jesus!

38:13.041 --> 38:14.750
Come on, Emmitt! Come on!

38:14.876 --> 38:17.252
Show me the Benjamins
the homeys are always rapping about!

38:17.420 --> 38:19.004
Emmitt, I assume
you're gonna take care of that.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.757
How the hell was I supposed to know
he was gonna show up without any cash?

38:21.883 --> 38:23.342
Right, but eventually...

38:23.426 --> 38:25.803
Duffy's right. What happens to our cut
if you pocket that deed?

38:25.887 --> 38:27.221
Just get control of yourself, boy. Just relax.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.306
- You're gonna get your portion.
- Of what? The land?

38:29.391 --> 38:31.016
What am I, a farmer?

38:31.226 --> 38:32.601
Show me the cash, Emmitt,

38:32.727 --> 38:36.313
or I swear to God
I'm gonna get a machete and a blowtorch,

38:36.398 --> 38:38.691
and I'm gonna make your body
as small as I possibly can.

38:38.775 --> 38:39.984
Duffy? Duffy, you got to get

38:40.068 --> 38:42.319
- control of yourself right now.
- Give me the goddamn money, Emmitt!

38:42.404 --> 38:44.613
- Lower that gun!
- Give me the goddamn money!

39:03.967 --> 39:05.092
Hey.

39:05.635 --> 39:08.095
I've shot people I like more for less.

39:11.599 --> 39:15.269
Yeah, this is Deputy U.S.
Marshal Raylan Givens.

39:15.478 --> 39:18.313
I'm gonna need some squad cars
and an ambulance.

40:23.505 --> 40:24.630
Givens.

40:28.843 --> 40:32.012
Joe, set us up again.
My friend here will be paying.

40:32.806 --> 40:35.140
Joe, let me take care of this one.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.814
Thought I told you not to come back in here.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.398
Just here for the hat.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.903
Well, I've kind of taken a liking to it.
Fits pretty good.

40:48.696 --> 40:52.741
Mister, that's a 10-gallon hat
on a 20-gallon head.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.581
We were just trying to have some fun.
You were the one out of line.

41:02.043 --> 41:06.046
Be that as it may,
I ain't leaving without the hat.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.885
And I'd be sober this time.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.777
Hell, man, I was always planning
on giving you back the hat.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.737
Why do you think I wore it in here?

41:33.074 --> 41:34.283
Thank you, Joe.
