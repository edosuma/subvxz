02:06.075 --> 02:07.360
Thank you so much for having us.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.440
Well, thank you for stopping by.

02:10.995 --> 02:13.315
I'm looking forward to getting
to know you better, Kevin.

02:13.365 --> 02:15.650
Yeah, me, too.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.250
Bye.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.995
Hey.

02:26.045 --> 02:27.745
Are you the new neighbors?

02:27.795 --> 02:28.995
Uh-huh.

02:29.045 --> 02:31.050
Welcome to Miracle.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.050
Thanks.

02:34.885 --> 02:36.755
Don't open it till I'm gone, okay?

02:36.805 --> 02:39.005
Why not?

02:39.055 --> 02:40.590
Because it's the greatest
present you ever got

02:40.640 --> 02:42.310
and I don't want you to make a scene.

02:44.310 --> 02:45.765
Happy birthday, Daddy.

02:45.815 --> 02:48.185
- Back by 11:00.
- Yeah.

02:57.075 --> 02:58.445
Bye, sweetheart.

02:58.495 --> 02:59.945
Bye.

02:59.995 --> 03:01.995
Seat belt.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.950
_

07:01.485 --> 07:03.705
Holy shit.

07:22.255 --> 07:24.340
How long?

07:25.595 --> 07:26.725
Were you dead?

07:28.265 --> 07:30.345
Eight hours.

07:32.315 --> 07:34.050
Is she still with you?

07:34.100 --> 07:35.555
Patti?

07:35.605 --> 07:38.605
No. She's gone.

07:42.995 --> 07:45.025
Then it worked.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.150
Did you bury me?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.920
My grandfather told me to.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.090
He's gone, too.

08:00.710 --> 08:02.510
I'm sorry.

08:05.765 --> 08:07.800
Where you went...

08:10.220 --> 08:12.105
did he help you?

08:13.275 --> 08:16.560
Yeah. He helped me a lot.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.230
What was it like?

08:22.865 --> 08:25.185
It was like a--

08:25.235 --> 08:27.320
a hotel.

08:27.370 --> 08:29.525
A hotel?

08:29.575 --> 08:31.575
Yeah.

08:34.745 --> 08:37.130
Did you see my sister there?

08:38.549 --> 08:40.414
No.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.180
I saw her somewhere else.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.185
I've got to talk to your father.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.415
How long you been up?

09:14.955 --> 09:17.740
A while.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.210
No coffee in the coffeepot.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.290
What are you drinking?

09:32.435 --> 09:34.140
You going to church?

09:36.055 --> 09:38.595
Now why would I do that?

09:38.645 --> 09:40.980
It's October 14th.

09:41.030 --> 09:42.680
We go to remember.

09:42.730 --> 09:45.145
I don't want to remember.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.790
John, open it.

09:55.660 --> 09:57.780
Open it or I will.

09:57.830 --> 10:01.450
It's my birthday present and
I'll open it when I'm ready.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.635
Wait!

10:22.155 --> 10:24.435
What-- what is it?

10:50.215 --> 10:52.380
She found it.

10:57.555 --> 10:59.520
No, she didn't.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.525
What?

11:04.060 --> 11:06.180
The night she disappeared, I was here

11:06.230 --> 11:08.850
when you and Michael
went to find her.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.615
Chirped the whole time.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.790
She must have caught another
one and put it in the box.

11:19.575 --> 11:22.495
And why would she do that?

11:24.300 --> 11:27.335
Because you wouldn't let it go.

11:35.975 --> 11:38.560
Fuck you, Erika.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.920
John.

12:06.625 --> 12:07.910
What happened?

12:07.960 --> 12:10.880
The print on the car
that Evie disappeared from...

12:10.930 --> 12:11.980
Yeah?

12:12.030 --> 12:13.550
You know how we told you
you'd waste your time

12:13.600 --> 12:16.000
trying to match it
with folks in town?

12:16.050 --> 12:18.385
You weren't.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.025
Hi.

12:43.075 --> 12:45.745
Uh, hey.

12:45.795 --> 12:47.615
Who are you?

12:47.665 --> 12:50.000
I'm Laurie.

12:50.050 --> 12:52.255
Garvey. Who are you?

12:52.305 --> 12:56.455
I'm John. I live next door.
Is Kevin home?

12:56.505 --> 12:58.340
Uh, no, he's--

12:58.390 --> 13:00.345
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, Jill.

13:00.395 --> 13:03.465
- I'm looking for your dad.
- Why? What's happening?

13:03.515 --> 13:04.930
I just need to talk to him.

13:04.980 --> 13:06.135
You know where he is?

13:06.185 --> 13:08.805
No, but I'm sure he'll be back.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.690
Are you?

13:10.740 --> 13:12.390
What?

13:12.440 --> 13:15.275
Sure he'll come back.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.745
Oh, he's definitely coming back.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.550
Print matched?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.515
Indeed it did.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.670
You want to talk,
we should go inside.

13:43.720 --> 13:47.105
No, we probably should
talk somewhere neutral.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.810
- Okay.
- Yeah, we'll give you a ride.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.735
Everything's okay.

13:59.785 --> 14:01.655
Stay here.

14:01.705 --> 14:02.990
Everything's fine.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.250
What are you doing with him?

14:13.300 --> 14:16.050
Just listen to what he has to say.

14:19.505 --> 14:22.140
I'll be all right. Stay here.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.915
Where have you been?

15:00.965 --> 15:02.800
Your dad's.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.005
I thought I told you not
to go over there anymore.

15:07.055 --> 15:09.270
I won't.

15:13.195 --> 15:14.975
You going to church?

15:20.200 --> 15:22.535
Go inside and get changed.

15:42.340 --> 15:43.960
Jill.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.340
You're gonna have
to talk to me eventually.

15:49.765 --> 15:51.515
What did you just say?

15:52.685 --> 15:55.385
I said you're gonna
have to talk to me.

15:55.435 --> 15:57.470
- I have to talk to you?
- I know.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.355
I know I deserve that and
I know that you're angry.

15:59.405 --> 16:00.990
No!

16:02.860 --> 16:04.695
You don't know shit.

16:04.745 --> 16:08.985
I know that your father's not
doing very well right now.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.650
He's got--

16:10.700 --> 16:12.785
he's got some serious problems, Jill,

16:12.835 --> 16:15.575
and I'm sure you know that, too.

16:15.625 --> 16:19.045
I came back here looking
for your brother, okay?

16:19.095 --> 16:20.410
And your father asked me to stay.

16:20.460 --> 16:22.710
He asked for my help.

16:24.515 --> 16:27.180
I'm not asking for anything.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.260
Jill, this is your house

16:37.310 --> 16:39.095
and if you want me to, I will leave.

16:39.145 --> 16:41.815
I will leave right now.

16:47.905 --> 16:49.870
He said that we should stay.

17:34.670 --> 17:36.705
Oh, sorry.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.370
Okay.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.990
All right. Okay, sit tight.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.790
I'm gonna find that feeding tube
and we'll get out of here, okay?

17:45.845 --> 17:48.835
Bingo! Right where Matt said it was.

17:48.885 --> 17:52.305
I'm just gonna change her
real quick, okay?

17:52.355 --> 17:53.970
Okay. Okay.

17:54.020 --> 17:56.890
How about some music?
You want some music?

17:56.940 --> 17:58.760
Let's try this. Okay.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.400
I know. I don't like that, either.

18:06.815 --> 18:09.070
- Oh, that's better.
- She's staying at her sister's.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.855
- That's better.
- She's not coming back.

18:11.905 --> 18:17.610
October, it's always,
you know, hard for her.

18:17.660 --> 18:20.410
I can't believe it's been four years.

18:22.550 --> 18:24.120
Did you lose someone?

18:24.170 --> 18:27.370
Our little girl, Emily.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.955
How old was she?

18:29.005 --> 18:30.675
14 months.

18:30.725 --> 18:33.295
She was talking real sentences.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.515
Before any of our friends' kids.

18:35.565 --> 18:36.965
I bragged about it.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.900
Well, that's what proud fathers do.

18:41.735 --> 18:45.435
Can I ask what happened?
Why your wife left?

18:47.025 --> 18:50.690
I want to have another baby.

18:51.745 --> 18:54.115
And your wife?

18:54.165 --> 18:56.200
She says it would hurt too much.

18:56.250 --> 18:59.155
Now, I told her we could start over.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.740
It's a new life.

19:00.790 --> 19:04.375
It'll help us, you know, forget.

19:06.210 --> 19:07.830
You know what, Andy?

19:07.880 --> 19:11.000
I'm gonna have to side
with your wife on this one.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.300
She's not ready.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.000
That thing inside all of us,

19:14.050 --> 19:17.255
that mechanism
that allows us to love,

19:17.305 --> 19:19.805
your wife's, it's broken.

19:19.855 --> 19:22.475
And a new baby's
not going to fix that.

19:22.525 --> 19:24.560
But you know what can?

19:26.115 --> 19:28.065
Jesus.

19:29.735 --> 19:34.405
After all, he was
the original Departure, right?

19:34.455 --> 19:36.405
Fix that, Jesus.

19:36.455 --> 19:38.410
Yeah, it's okay.

20:07.820 --> 20:09.305
Shh, shh, shh.

20:09.355 --> 20:11.355
Nora.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.245
What are you doing here?

20:23.455 --> 20:25.420
Where's Matt?

20:35.465 --> 20:37.765
Oh, my God.

20:40.770 --> 20:42.520
Hi.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.855
Hi.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.410
Matt.

21:23.230 --> 21:24.930
Is this real?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.800
This is real?

21:28.850 --> 21:30.940
It's real.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.190
Oh, God!

21:33.240 --> 21:34.825
Oh, thank God.

21:42.615 --> 21:45.485
Oh!

21:45.535 --> 21:47.320
Are you all right?

21:47.370 --> 21:49.870
I'm a little confused, but okay.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.045
You have to take her back right now.

21:55.095 --> 21:57.965
- What?
- Mary, listen.

21:58.015 --> 22:01.250
You can't be out here. It's not--

22:01.300 --> 22:03.555
you have to go back
to town right now.

22:03.605 --> 22:05.170
Okay, let's go, then.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.805
No, I can't.

22:06.855 --> 22:08.260
You have to take her back right now.

22:08.310 --> 22:10.140
It's not safe out here. The baby.

22:13.115 --> 22:14.865
The what?

22:17.235 --> 22:20.120
- You didn't tell her?
- I thought you would want to.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.875
I'm pregnant?

22:35.135 --> 22:38.205
Now, Mary, do you remember

22:38.255 --> 22:41.290
the night you woke up, we, um--

22:41.340 --> 22:43.045
- Had sex?
- Yes.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.810
Of course I remember.

22:46.395 --> 22:50.885
Well, you waking up, that happened.

22:50.935 --> 22:52.635
This baby happened

22:52.685 --> 22:55.805
because you were across
that bridge in that town.

22:55.855 --> 22:58.775
Now, I'll get there soon enough,
but you've got to go now.

22:58.825 --> 23:01.195
Tell you what-- I'm gonna feed Lily
and I'll come back in 10 minutes.

23:01.245 --> 23:02.980
- Hey, Nora--
- 10 minutes, Matt.

23:03.030 --> 23:05.150
And then I'll take her
back in, I promise.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.700
- Okay, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

23:21.715 --> 23:25.465
Hey, where'd you steal her from?

23:27.155 --> 23:31.425
That's not your baby.
That's not your baby.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.965
That's not her baby.

23:35.015 --> 23:36.670
_

23:49.460 --> 23:51.375
You know her?

23:52.995 --> 23:55.495
She's your dad's girlfriend, right?

23:57.165 --> 23:59.955
She sprayed me with a hose once.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.335
I liked her.

24:05.310 --> 24:09.010
Are you scared for them?
For your family?

24:10.680 --> 24:12.515
There is no family.

24:12.565 --> 24:15.315
Where'd you hear that?

24:16.685 --> 24:19.390
I thought that's the point.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.975
No, Tom.

24:21.025 --> 24:23.360
That's not the point at all.

24:27.830 --> 24:30.530
Family is everything.

24:35.590 --> 24:37.505
Here we go.

24:56.145 --> 24:58.845
Sorry, ma'am. Park's closed today.

24:58.895 --> 25:00.095
Really? Why?

25:00.145 --> 25:01.615
It's October 14th.

25:02.985 --> 25:04.650
It's the anniversary
of the Departure.

25:04.700 --> 25:08.905
It's a time for the townfolks
to be with themselves, reflect.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.995
Reflect on what?

25:13.045 --> 25:14.610
I'm sorry?

25:14.660 --> 25:17.915
Well, nothing happened
here to the townsfolk.

25:17.965 --> 25:21.670
It's kind of like a temple
closing down on Christmas.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.470
Not really your holiday,
don't you think?

25:26.975 --> 25:29.295
I'm sorry, ma'am, but
unless you have a wristband

25:29.345 --> 25:32.675
or a dispensation form, I'm gonna
have to ask you to turn around.

25:36.900 --> 25:40.605
I have 35 pounds
of plastic explosive.

25:40.655 --> 25:42.820
Will that work?

25:43.475 --> 25:44.475
What?

25:45.550 --> 25:46.550
Whoa!

25:46.595 --> 25:48.495
Stop! Someone-- Hey!

26:05.725 --> 26:07.165
We have a runner on the bridge.

26:07.215 --> 26:09.165
- We have a runner on the bridge.
- Go, let's go!

26:09.215 --> 26:10.920
Let's go!

26:19.140 --> 26:21.260
Stop!

26:21.310 --> 26:23.395
Get down on the ground now!

26:24.980 --> 26:27.450
I said get down!

26:29.120 --> 26:31.320
Get on the ground now!

26:39.465 --> 26:40.995
Get in there, cuff her.

26:44.165 --> 26:46.205
We got an unauthorized
vehicle on the bridge.

26:46.255 --> 26:49.170
Possible code blue.
I repeat, possible code blue.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.955
Which one is yours?

27:20.005 --> 27:21.655
What?

27:21.705 --> 27:24.660
Well, they took your dog
when you got here, right?

27:24.710 --> 27:27.160
Which one is he?

27:27.210 --> 27:29.715
I know we're not here
to talk about my dog, John.

27:29.765 --> 27:32.330
No, that's exactly
why we're here, Kevin.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.670
You tell me where my daughter is

27:34.720 --> 27:36.685
and I'll let you take your dog home.

27:38.055 --> 27:40.675
I don't know where your daughter is,

27:40.725 --> 27:43.260
but I know she didn't depart.

27:43.310 --> 27:47.145
No? Well, what did she do?

27:48.565 --> 27:50.980
She staged it.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.320
She and her friends,
to make it look like--

27:55.370 --> 27:57.040
And you know this how?

28:00.795 --> 28:02.575
I saw her do it.

28:05.215 --> 28:07.835
You saw her do it

28:07.885 --> 28:09.670
and you waited all
this time to tell me?

28:09.720 --> 28:12.205
I didn't remember until this morning.

28:12.255 --> 28:15.090
What sparked it, this memory?

28:15.140 --> 28:16.460
What do you want me
to tell you, John?

28:16.510 --> 28:18.795
I want you to tell me the truth.

28:18.845 --> 28:20.980
What made you remember?

28:25.320 --> 28:27.400
I died.

28:31.940 --> 28:35.660
I had a-- a problem.

28:36.830 --> 28:39.785
Michael took me to his grandfather's.

28:39.835 --> 28:42.870
He said he could help.
He gave me, like, a--

28:42.920 --> 28:44.235
My son took you
to meet his grandfather?

28:44.285 --> 28:46.155
Yeah, Virgil. He helped me.

28:46.205 --> 28:47.655
No, Michael wouldn't do that.

28:47.705 --> 28:49.410
Listen, man, he did.
I swear, man, he did.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.210
Prove it.

28:56.435 --> 28:59.135
The old man told me
what he did to you.

29:06.310 --> 29:08.695
I'm so sorry.

29:09.730 --> 29:10.930
I'm sorry. No one should ever--

29:10.980 --> 29:12.400
Man, shut the fuck up. That's a lie.

29:12.450 --> 29:16.315
He didn't do nothing to me.
You don't know shit.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.905
All right, now--

29:18.955 --> 29:22.025
look, let's stay focused, man,

29:22.075 --> 29:24.695
because, see, I want
to make sure I get this.

29:24.745 --> 29:26.325
Yeah.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.615
You saw my daughter

29:30.665 --> 29:33.835
pretend to disappear

29:33.885 --> 29:36.125
and the only reason
you remember that today

29:36.175 --> 29:38.225
is because you came
back from the dead?

29:40.395 --> 29:44.345
I know you don't think
it can happen here, John,

29:44.395 --> 29:46.015
but it did.

29:47.235 --> 29:50.685
You're right, Kevin.
That can't happen here.

29:50.735 --> 29:54.105
But I need you to explain me this.

29:56.025 --> 29:58.310
Evie loved her mother.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.830
She loved her brother.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.450
And she loved me.

30:06.670 --> 30:09.155
So why in God's name

30:09.205 --> 30:11.705
would she do this to us?

30:13.295 --> 30:14.745
I don't know.

30:14.795 --> 30:19.215
Okay, well, take a fucking guess.

30:21.270 --> 30:24.005
Maybe she didn't.

30:24.055 --> 30:25.970
What?

30:28.225 --> 30:30.225
Love you.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.065
Who knows what goes
through people's heads?

30:37.115 --> 30:39.605
You know, your daughter--

31:05.145 --> 31:07.680
Hey!

31:07.730 --> 31:10.550
- What's going on?
- John, it's Evie. Follow us.

31:12.820 --> 31:14.805
What?

32:04.620 --> 32:06.655
- Evie!
- John, you gotta get back.

32:06.705 --> 32:08.525
No, you have got to let me through.

32:08.575 --> 32:10.495
We can't. There's a
bomb in the trailer.

32:10.545 --> 32:12.160
- What?
- Buddy, you gotta go back.

32:12.210 --> 32:14.615
John, you gotta get back. The
trailer is rigged with explosives.

32:14.665 --> 32:18.035
Why-- why would anybody do-- Evie!

32:18.085 --> 32:19.835
What happened?

32:26.895 --> 32:28.975
Can I borrow those?

32:37.855 --> 32:40.070
It's the three girls.

32:41.990 --> 32:43.860
What three girls?

32:45.910 --> 32:48.245
The ones who departed.

32:52.645 --> 32:54.930
_

32:57.125 --> 32:58.740
No, no, no, no.

32:58.790 --> 33:00.910
We won't be able to get back in.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.080
They're gonna blow up the bridge!

33:03.130 --> 33:05.500
There's a bomb!

33:15.475 --> 33:17.980
Blow it up! Blow it up!

33:18.030 --> 33:20.895
Blow it up! Blow it up!

33:20.945 --> 33:24.985
Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!

33:42.750 --> 33:45.505
♪ Our hearts were
pure, we knew for sure ♪

33:45.555 --> 33:47.875
♪ A miracle ♪

33:47.925 --> 33:53.630
♪ That God had spared our town ♪

34:04.605 --> 34:08.530
October 14th.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.580
Four years ago.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.034
Everywhere else in the world,

34:14.085 --> 34:17.155
they knew something had happened.

34:17.205 --> 34:18.989
Yeah.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.239
But we didn't.

34:21.290 --> 34:23.460
No.

34:23.510 --> 34:26.625
Not until the phones started ringing.

34:28.179 --> 34:30.715
Till we turned on our televisions.

34:32.135 --> 34:36.425
And we ran out onto the streets.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.060
Found each other.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.510
Yes, we did.

34:39.560 --> 34:44.179
And everyone asked
the same question--

34:44.230 --> 34:46.195
is everyone okay?

34:48.400 --> 34:50.405
Is everyone still here?

34:50.455 --> 34:52.605
Yes.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.940
- And we were.
- Amen.

34:54.989 --> 34:58.160
We were still here.

34:58.210 --> 35:00.495
Amen.

35:00.545 --> 35:02.415
We were--

35:15.345 --> 35:18.180
Michael has asked to say a few words.

35:26.575 --> 35:29.110
My mom tells a story.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.310
A lot of you have probably heard it.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.980
She says that there was water

35:35.030 --> 35:38.150
trickling down
the stairs in our house.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.370
And when she followed it up, she saw
that it was coming from the bathroom.

35:44.090 --> 35:48.160
She opened the door and she swears
a wave just washed past her.

35:50.930 --> 35:53.715
And there were me and Evie,

35:53.765 --> 35:56.850
five years old
and an overflowing tub.

35:58.270 --> 36:02.025
My mom says she asked
Evie why she did it.

36:03.775 --> 36:07.765
And my sister said, "I just
wanted to see what would happen."

36:10.785 --> 36:12.735
That's the story that you always tell

36:12.785 --> 36:15.905
and everyone laughs,
even me and Evie.

36:18.410 --> 36:21.025
She laughed to protect you, Mom,

36:21.075 --> 36:23.210
because it's not the truth.

36:27.585 --> 36:30.335
I'm the one who turned the water on.

36:33.975 --> 36:37.875
I turned it on all the way
because Evie was crying so loud

36:37.925 --> 36:40.295
and she didn't want you to hear.

36:40.345 --> 36:44.435
She was crying because we didn't
know why our father was gone.

36:44.485 --> 36:47.600
Or why he did what he did.

36:48.770 --> 36:51.320
But she was crying so loud.

36:55.195 --> 36:57.860
So I turned the water on
and I drowned her out.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.000
Until she could pretend she was okay.

37:05.005 --> 37:08.590
Nobody disappeared from here on
October 14th four years ago.

37:09.875 --> 37:11.925
But they did before.

37:13.430 --> 37:15.630
And after.

37:20.055 --> 37:23.135
We are the 9,261.

37:25.225 --> 37:27.390
We are not spared.

39:21.675 --> 39:23.875
That's not your baby.

39:23.925 --> 39:26.560
That's not your baby.

39:29.350 --> 39:31.850
- She doesn't belong to you.
- Shut the fuck up!

39:38.775 --> 39:41.980
It's okay.

39:42.030 --> 39:44.195
It's okay.

39:48.870 --> 39:52.255
That clock, what is that?

39:53.590 --> 39:55.910
What's inside here?

39:55.960 --> 39:59.095
Y'all just gonna blow yourselves up?

40:19.700 --> 40:22.270
Whoo!

41:01.775 --> 41:03.110
Y'all need to move back now.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.475
Everybody move back.

41:04.525 --> 41:07.280
- Back up. Ma'am, back up, please.
- Dad.

41:07.330 --> 41:08.780
Sir, I want you to step back.

41:08.830 --> 41:10.365
- Back up.
- Step back.

41:10.415 --> 41:12.700
- Back up.
- Erika!

41:12.750 --> 41:13.985
Everybody, back up.

41:14.035 --> 41:16.570
Get off the bridge!

41:16.620 --> 41:18.590
Erika!

41:20.875 --> 41:23.460
Are you just gonna blow yourself up?

41:24.630 --> 41:25.915
'Cause if that's what it is,

41:25.965 --> 41:28.550
I'm not leaving
this bridge, Evangeline.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.350
I'm not.

41:31.605 --> 41:34.270
You're just gonna
have to blow me up, too.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.570
Get out of my way!

41:58.915 --> 42:00.750
It's empty!

42:00.800 --> 42:04.550
It's empty! It's empty!

42:05.505 --> 42:07.470
It's empty!

42:13.765 --> 42:15.215
Oh, Lord!

42:15.265 --> 42:18.015
Nothing. It's zero.

42:57.975 --> 42:59.675
Okay, rangers, hold that gate.

42:59.725 --> 43:02.145
Get away from the fence.
Everybody, back off.

43:02.195 --> 43:04.680
Hold the fence. Hold the--

43:04.730 --> 43:06.350
- Back off!
- Back off!

43:06.400 --> 43:08.435
- Everyone, back off!
- Pull back!

43:08.485 --> 43:10.100
- Right there.
- Pull back!

43:10.150 --> 43:12.490
There's too many of them.
Let them go.

43:12.540 --> 43:14.540
Let them go!

43:18.660 --> 43:22.030
Why are you doing this?

43:22.080 --> 43:24.000
I don't understand.

43:37.310 --> 43:40.330
_

44:37.005 --> 44:38.480
We need to go now.

44:38.530 --> 44:39.990
Okay, my car's over there.
We can pack--

44:40.040 --> 44:41.860
- No, we're going in.
- Matt.

44:41.910 --> 44:43.780
Mary, I need you to trust me.

44:43.830 --> 44:45.530
We need to get you
and the baby back in.

44:45.580 --> 44:47.380
Now is our chance. Do you trust me?

44:49.500 --> 44:52.505
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go.

44:52.555 --> 44:54.755
Matt, wait.

44:55.890 --> 44:57.810
Wait!

44:59.230 --> 45:01.515
She's not yours.

45:01.565 --> 45:04.350
Hey! Hey!

45:11.655 --> 45:13.490
Hey!

45:36.765 --> 45:39.350
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Hurry up.

46:20.975 --> 46:23.095
Nora.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.950
It's okay. You're safe.

46:47.535 --> 46:49.205
Okay. Hey.

46:49.255 --> 46:51.625
It's okay. You're okay.

46:51.675 --> 46:54.125
Yeah, I know. I know.

46:54.175 --> 46:57.710
I know. I know. I know.

48:25.935 --> 48:28.890
Motherfucker.

48:28.940 --> 48:31.520
Motherfucker!

48:41.450 --> 48:43.365
Dad?

48:45.370 --> 48:47.155
Dad?

48:48.325 --> 48:49.525
Can you hear me?

48:49.575 --> 48:51.445
I'm not fucking doing this again.

48:51.495 --> 48:53.160
Where are you?

49:00.250 --> 49:02.050
Fuck!

49:45.715 --> 49:48.050
- Hello?
- Mr. Garvey?

49:48.100 --> 49:49.500
Yeah?

49:49.550 --> 49:51.670
We're aware this isn't
your jurisdiction.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.470
You're a police officer, right?

49:54.890 --> 49:56.340
Uh, that's right.

49:56.390 --> 49:58.760
Something terrible
is happening in the lobby bar.

49:58.810 --> 50:01.015
Another officer, he's being attacked.

50:01.065 --> 50:02.765
I think they're gonna kill him.

50:02.815 --> 50:04.730
I'll be right there.

50:32.175 --> 50:33.880
Yeah.

50:33.930 --> 50:36.380
- - Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

50:36.430 --> 50:38.600
You're all lovely people.

50:38.650 --> 50:40.685
Who's next? Who wants to sing a song?

50:40.735 --> 50:43.220
Who wants to spin the wheel?

50:43.270 --> 50:44.525
An officer of the law.

50:44.575 --> 50:47.825
Will you regale us
with a tune, Officer?

50:52.700 --> 50:55.200
- No.
- I will. I want to.

50:55.250 --> 50:57.120
All right, darling. Come on up.

50:57.170 --> 50:59.535
The stage is yours.

51:09.630 --> 51:11.915
♪ Just call me angel ♪

51:11.965 --> 51:15.670
♪ Of the morning, angel ♪

51:15.720 --> 51:17.005
♪ Just touch my cheek... ♪

51:17.055 --> 51:18.090
What is this?

51:18.140 --> 51:20.260
Sorry, do I know you, mate?

51:20.310 --> 51:22.175
Of course you fucking know me.

51:22.225 --> 51:25.095
We met on the bridge. You
tied a noose around my neck.

51:25.145 --> 51:27.600
Oh, sure. I remember.

51:27.650 --> 51:29.100
The uniform threw me off.

51:29.150 --> 51:32.070
- Did you call me?
- Call you?

51:32.120 --> 51:34.825
I got a call. There was a cop
getting attacked down here.

51:34.875 --> 51:38.910
Huh. Only cop I see around
here is you, Officer.

51:38.960 --> 51:42.450
Suppose this crowd could turn on
anyone if they can't sing for shit.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.365
Just tell me what I
need to do to get back.

51:44.415 --> 51:46.620
Why do you want to go back?

51:46.670 --> 51:49.255
Because I have a family.
Because I love them and I--

51:49.305 --> 51:52.760
Yes, you love your family.
It's not your time.

51:52.810 --> 51:55.590
Still got so much to live for.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.630
Oh, come on, be original, mate.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.965
Why should you go back
and the rest of us--
