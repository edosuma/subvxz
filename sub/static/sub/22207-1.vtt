04:57.840 --> 05:00.633
Halt!
Attaque touche.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.595
Touche reer.
Two-Zero.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.806
En garde.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.433
Ready?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.643
Fence!

05:17.526 --> 05:18.736
Halt!

05:19.528 --> 05:20.653
Halt!

05:20.654 --> 05:22.030
Attaque, touche.

05:22.031 --> 05:23.990
Touche Heydrich.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.533
Two-One.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.536
En garde.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.083
Ready?

05:33.625 --> 05:35.169
Fence.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.131
Halt, halt, halt!

05:56.440 --> 05:58.442
Christina!

05:59.610 --> 06:02.570
I'm so happy
you asked me to come.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.280
Let me take that.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.532
- Thanks
- Good trip?

06:55.207 --> 06:57.708
Birgitta,
give me my dance card.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.336
Sorry.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.548
It's already full, darling.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.390
No, it's not.

07:12.808 --> 07:16.352
Not him, Lina.
He's weird.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.731
Steer clear if you
want to stay intact.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.276
Maybe I don't.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.791
My name is Heydrich.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.836
Reinhard.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.755
Write it down.

09:38.579 --> 09:43.417
It's so sad. Our
country has become so weak.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.920
Yes, well it's not gonna
change any time soon.

09:47.921 --> 09:48.879
Don't be so sure.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.009
There is one man who
could change everything.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.486
If we are to take
this any further,

10:12.487 --> 10:15.198
I'd rather you knew my beliefs.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.202
Does it bother you?

10:19.911 --> 10:20.578
No.

10:20.579 --> 10:24.499
Reinhard, you absolutely
have to read Hitler's book.

10:25.000 --> 10:25.417
Which book?

10:25.418 --> 10:29.378
Mein Kampf of c-- Reinhard,
you have so much to learn!

10:29.379 --> 10:31.797
Okay. Okay, okay. Yes I do.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.343
A lot.
A lot to learn.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.598
You like the picture?

10:40.349 --> 10:42.768
I love the picture.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.313
You look...

10:47.314 --> 10:48.356
What?

10:48.357 --> 10:50.025
...beautiful.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.901
Thank you.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.658
When I was a little girl, I
would imagine that each of these

10:58.659 --> 11:03.412
trees was a century watching
over me as I passed by.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.167
I wish you could have
seen it in those days.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.460
We had a party every weekend.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.546
There were vast buffets,
flowers everywhere.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.883
There would be an orchestra
who would play all night...

11:15.884 --> 11:18.177
And when it was
time to go to bed...

11:18.178 --> 11:22.265
I would hide under the piano
so my mother couldn't find me.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.686
I wish you could have
seen it in those times.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.270
You have seen my parents.

11:28.271 --> 11:32.358
Well, no one escapes the crisis.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.944
And they're proud so they
keep their heads held high.

11:34.945 --> 11:39.866
But I know it grieves them to
think of those lost years.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.412
What I want more
than anything...

11:44.413 --> 11:47.916
is to live that time again.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.837
And one day I will.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.569
Shoulder!

12:16.570 --> 12:18.071
Arms!

12:20.449 --> 12:24.828
To the color- present arms!

12:38.341 --> 12:40.926
I've never seen that
woman before, sir.

12:40.927 --> 12:44.555
Her name is Christina
Wegel, she lives in Berlin.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.141
She says she met you at a
dance eighteen months ago

12:47.142 --> 12:49.643
and that you have conducted
intimate relations since.

12:49.644 --> 12:53.189
She says she has visited you
here several times where you

12:53.190 --> 12:55.733
have taken advantage
of her virtue.

12:55.734 --> 12:56.400
I haven't.

12:56.401 --> 13:00.613
And it was her clear assumption
that you were betrothed to her.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.406
Well, she's a lying bitch, sir.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.324
Calm down, Reinhard.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.408
Sh-- How can I calm down sir?

13:04.409 --> 13:09.163
This woman, this woman is
trying to ruin my reputation.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.375
You've been summoned
to appear in court-

13:13.877 --> 13:16.004
with immediate effect.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.012
A court martial, sir?

13:25.013 --> 13:26.848
Yes.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.562
You're a good soldier Reinhard.

13:33.563 --> 13:37.067
But there is nothing more I
can do to help you on this.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.110
This young woman's father
is best friends with

13:40.111 --> 13:42.697
Admiral Raeder in Berlin.

13:43.949 --> 13:50.497
Your Honors, this scurrilous
accusation is nothing but lies.

13:52.707 --> 13:57.212
Yet this is
your signature, is it not?

14:01.758 --> 14:06.930
This young lady did come and
visit you at your request?

14:07.514 --> 14:10.391
But it was never a serious
relationship, sir.

14:10.392 --> 14:14.521
And Miss Wegel was
always aware of that.

14:14.604 --> 14:21.194
So you did have sexual
relations with this young woman?

14:23.154 --> 14:28.367
I ask you again: did you,
or did you not have

14:28.368 --> 14:31.913
sexual relations
with Miss Wegel?

14:36.543 --> 14:40.963
She was the one that
insisted upon seeing me.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.967
And now, out of nothing
but pure jealousy

14:44.968 --> 14:48.388
is trying to ruin
my future marriage.

14:49.139 --> 14:52.099
I know you know what I mean.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.767
I know you all know what I mean.
None of you.

14:53.768 --> 14:57.063
None of you men would
marry a woman like this.

14:59.357 --> 15:04.278
This court does not consider
such behavior befitting an

15:04.279 --> 15:07.782
officer of the German Navy.

15:12.746 --> 15:17.000
And I pity the man who
has to call you a son.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.548
You may leave.

16:02.837 --> 16:07.925
No visitors!
I said no visitors!

16:07.926 --> 16:09.510
None, none, none!

16:09.511 --> 16:12.138
Open the door!

16:39.791 --> 16:42.377
We need to speak
about our future.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.837
She meant nothing to me.

16:44.838 --> 16:45.754
What?

16:45.755 --> 16:48.716
She meant nothing to me.
Nothing!

16:48.717 --> 16:52.886
You'll never, ever
speak about her again.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.556
Ever!

16:55.807 --> 16:58.101
Then be a man.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.439
Don't cry.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.277
Pull yourself together.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.991
If you want to be my husband...

17:13.366 --> 17:15.827
You'll be my husband.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.038
And I mean it.

17:19.039 --> 17:23.334
We will never, ever
talk about this again.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.936
Put some clothes on.

18:12.383 --> 18:16.595
Your future father-
in-law told me a lot about you.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.389
How long have you
been a party member?

18:19.390 --> 18:21.809
Two months,
Herr Himmler.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.977
Not long.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.730
I was in the Navy
before that sir.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.065
I know.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.651
You were disgraced.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.239
Yes.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.537
That's of little concern to me.

18:43.665 --> 18:48.168
I'm looking for someone to run
the new SS intelligence unit.

18:48.169 --> 18:51.004
Its objective is to
gain information on

18:51.005 --> 18:53.257
our political enemies.

18:53.258 --> 18:56.593
And expose infiltration
by government agencies

18:56.594 --> 18:58.596
and foreign powers.

18:59.222 --> 18:59.805
Tell me-

18:59.806 --> 19:03.475
what is your philosophy on
intelligence gathering?

19:03.476 --> 19:09.023
Intelligence is a marriage of
instinct and information, sir.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.358
Go on.

19:11.359 --> 19:15.571
Intelligence requires
organization and industry.

19:15.572 --> 19:18.490
No one, Herr Himmler, will
work harder than me and no

19:18.491 --> 19:20.702
one will be more organized.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.913
Can you prove this?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.665
Your chicken farm.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.917
It makes no money, am I correct?

19:28.918 --> 19:30.544
It's not your
fault Herr Himmler.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.754
You have six sheds,
seventy chickens in each,

19:32.755 --> 19:35.340
but you have foxes...
getting inside.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.551
I noticed the holes along
the fence as I arrived.

19:37.552 --> 19:40.262
You're not here enough to ensure
adequate maintenance and your

19:40.263 --> 19:44.516
farmhand is overweight and
unable to perform physically

19:44.517 --> 19:46.644
demanding work.

19:47.061 --> 19:51.190
For an efficient farm you need
proper upkeep and economies of

19:51.191 --> 19:53.817
scale vastly in excess
of what you have now.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.445
See, I could run the farm for
you and I guarantee within six

19:56.446 --> 19:59.573
months I would give you a
tenfold increase in profit,

19:59.574 --> 20:03.578
and a complete
eradication of fox attacks.

20:05.580 --> 20:09.417
Or I could run your new
SS intelligence division.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.714
You could.

20:20.929 --> 20:25.098
So you're saying he's
married to a Nazi party member

20:25.099 --> 20:26.767
but he's actually a communist.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.101
Absolutely, sir.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.353
And you can prove this?

20:29.354 --> 20:32.814
It's confirmed by
different sources, sir.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.358
Excellent, alright.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.859
Thank you very much.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.695
Aye, sir.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.575
Heil Hitler.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.578
Heil Hitler.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.579
You are Müller, yes?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.956
Yes, Commandant.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.416
I have been assigned
to you by Herr Hitler.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.835
I know. Heydrich. Welcome.

20:53.836 --> 20:57.589
Our first objective, Herr
Müller, is to put an end to

20:57.590 --> 20:59.968
these Communist criminals.

21:00.969 --> 21:04.846
I no longer want
to see their posters

21:04.847 --> 21:07.808
on our streets or
on our nation's walls.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.602
No German should have
to read this filth.

21:17.652 --> 21:23.616
The Communist Party is the only
party that protects the workers!

21:24.325 --> 21:25.284
Huh?

21:25.285 --> 21:28.204
Lies and filth!

21:30.123 --> 21:30.999
Huh?

21:31.124 --> 21:35.085
All power
needs men, in the shadows...

21:35.086 --> 21:39.089
taking care of the most
important secrets.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.132
You agree Rohm?

21:40.133 --> 21:44.177
You tell your
comrades there is one party,

21:44.178 --> 21:49.100
one people,
one Germany, one Führer!

21:50.602 --> 21:53.103
I've heard a lot about you...

21:53.104 --> 21:55.605
a lot about your methods.

21:55.606 --> 22:00.403
They say you have spies and
informers all over the capital,

22:00.486 --> 22:05.033
and enemies of the party
are in terror of you.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.786
You should join
the SA, in fact.

22:08.911 --> 22:09.911
Oh, come!

22:09.912 --> 22:12.497
You have 40,000
soldiers already.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.791
Is that not enough for you?

22:14.792 --> 22:16.877
Jealous, are you?

22:16.878 --> 22:21.674
Just because your little SS is
operating out of a shoebox?

22:22.717 --> 22:25.135
I've known Adolf for
a very long time.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.387
Yes, you are
important to him now.

22:27.388 --> 22:32.352
At least until he gets
the party into power...

22:32.935 --> 22:35.646
Well, we will see about that.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.859
This wine is really delicious.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.779
Yes, it is.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.529
To Germany!

22:44.530 --> 22:46.532
To Germany!

22:50.036 --> 22:50.744
...a shoebox.

22:50.745 --> 22:53.497
Yes, you're the
man with a shoebox.

22:53.498 --> 22:53.956
Huh.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.583
Yes, it's funny, is it, girl?
Mm.

22:56.584 --> 22:59.127
Yeah, gonna mop
the insurgent, huh?

23:26.572 --> 23:27.948
Heil Hitler!

23:27.949 --> 23:29.658
Heil Hitler!

23:58.479 --> 23:59.980
Heil Hitler!

23:59.981 --> 24:02.066
Heil Hitler!

24:02.316 --> 24:03.984
You know who Hitler is?

24:03.985 --> 24:04.734
Yeah.

24:04.735 --> 24:07.654
That's him.
See that man in the picture?

24:07.655 --> 24:08.280
That's our leader.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.907
He has just been named
Chancellor of Germany.

24:10.908 --> 24:11.658
Do you know what that means?

24:11.659 --> 24:14.744
It means that he will be
able to save our country.

24:14.745 --> 24:18.583
That's why mommy and
daddy are so happy today.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.345
Mein Führer,

24:32.346 --> 24:36.350
I stand by the principle that
only the best of our people-

24:36.559 --> 24:38.935
the racially most
carefully selected,

24:38.936 --> 24:42.814
of excellent character
and pure spirit are capable

24:42.815 --> 24:45.734
of providing a service to
combat all that is negative

24:45.735 --> 24:48.863
and returning our
nation to greatness.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.324
I am German mein Führer.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.744
And I love my country.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.581
Commandant Heydrich
has assembled elements

24:59.582 --> 25:03.210
confirming the Führer's
doubts about Rohm and his men.

25:03.211 --> 25:09.049
It is our duty as members of the
SS to eliminate anybody that

25:09.050 --> 25:13.095
stands in the way of the
Führer and his great plan.

25:13.262 --> 25:17.307
Our time has come to purify
the party and eliminate all

25:17.308 --> 25:19.935
dissident members.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.492
Heil Hitler.

26:13.614 --> 26:16.909
Never leave dirty
glasses on the table.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.077
- Lina.
- Yes?

26:19.078 --> 26:22.622
Stop running around like
a headless chicken. Come.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.874
Sit next to me for a moment.

26:24.875 --> 26:25.834
Oh.

26:27.211 --> 26:31.132
We are so happy that you made
the time to see us today.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.217
Of course.

26:34.802 --> 26:35.552
Ah.

26:35.553 --> 26:37.220
You must be very proud.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.890
Oh, two boys, it's wonderful.

26:40.391 --> 26:41.182
No.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.561
I mean about Heydrich.

26:44.645 --> 26:48.899
You were the one who put him on
the right path to the Party.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.069
He will go far.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.155
I knew he would.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.867
Reinhard is special.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.541
He's very special.

27:07.043 --> 27:10.379
You know what the
Führer calls him?

27:12.173 --> 27:15.676
'The man with the iron heart'.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.994
This is Heydrich.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.372
Boy or a girl?

29:08.873 --> 29:10.833
You are the elite.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.795
The new political warrior.

29:16.088 --> 29:21.301
Chosen because of your racial
quality, your ideological

29:21.302 --> 29:24.555
commitment, your competence.

29:25.306 --> 29:29.476
The Führer has tasked us with
the most important of missions.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.356
The Germanisation
of the new Reich.

29:35.107 --> 29:39.569
As the Wehrmacht
conquers we must cleanse.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.740
All aliens, all sick,

29:43.741 --> 29:48.954
all hostiles to the
nation will be eliminated.

30:04.845 --> 30:09.517
This is too much for an
individual, but as the SS,

30:09.975 --> 30:14.104
the Einzatsgruppen,
we'll be strong.

30:15.231 --> 30:18.400
And remind you
of your sacred oath:

30:18.818 --> 30:22.071
spare neither your own blood...

30:22.321 --> 30:23.571
nor the blood of others,

30:23.572 --> 30:26.867
when the fate of the
Nation depends upon it.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.244
Future generations
will thank us...

30:29.245 --> 30:32.372
when they realize what
we have undertaken.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.030
Heil Hitler.

32:32.493 --> 32:34.619
I've kept
you waiting, General.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.287
Not at all, sir.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.956
You've had a long journey?

32:37.957 --> 32:39.332
Enjoyable.

32:39.333 --> 32:42.835
You move quickly, general.
The war goes well.

32:42.836 --> 32:46.339
It appears your
troops have no equal.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.676
They sweep all before them.

32:49.009 --> 32:52.095
I know you're busy, so
come straight to the point.

32:52.096 --> 32:55.223
My Einsatzgruppen cannot
perform as expected without the

32:55.224 --> 32:59.018
proper support and cooperation
of the Wehrmacht, sir.

32:59.019 --> 33:03.064
I run a regular army,
General Heydrich.

33:03.065 --> 33:04.440
We fight other armies.

33:04.441 --> 33:05.817
Your men are thugs.

33:05.818 --> 33:09.946
The Führer, sir, is fighting
a war unlike any other.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.865
A war?

33:12.282 --> 33:13.408
I am General of the Wehrmacht.

33:13.409 --> 33:17.203
I was fighting at Verdun before
you even reached puberty.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.122
Don't try to tell me about wars.

33:19.123 --> 33:20.123
You're right.

33:20.124 --> 33:23.126
You do your job,
and I will do mine.

33:23.127 --> 33:28.382
And my job, general, is
policing and intelligence.

33:28.799 --> 33:34.096
Yes, I watch, I take
notes, and I inform.

33:35.389 --> 33:37.890
And I will be informing the
Führer's office of your

33:37.891 --> 33:40.477
predilection for young whores.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.354
I beg your pardon?

33:43.355 --> 33:43.896
Berlin brothel.

33:43.897 --> 33:47.942
22nd of August, Ilena
Mandel, 21 years of age.

33:47.943 --> 33:52.572
22nd of November, Katarina
Werke, 17 years of age.

33:52.573 --> 33:53.614
February 9th...

33:53.615 --> 33:54.365
Enough!

33:54.366 --> 33:57.869
You are a high-ranking officer
of the German Wehrmacht

33:57.870 --> 34:00.663
and fucking impure women
and bringing disgrace

34:00.664 --> 34:02.457
upon your family.

34:02.458 --> 34:06.128
I doubt any Court Martial
will look kindly upon you.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.922
You'd know all about
that, wouldn't you?

34:17.264 --> 34:18.514
So?

34:20.684 --> 34:24.645
I will send you all information
gathered by the Wehrmacht on the

34:24.646 --> 34:27.690
opponents of the regime.

34:28.734 --> 34:34.072
But you can only begin your...
cleansing after we have left.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.241
Excellent.

34:48.795 --> 34:49.795
Ready!

34:49.797 --> 34:50.630
Fire!

35:02.392 --> 35:04.061
Step forward.

35:06.855 --> 35:07.522
What is the problem?

35:07.523 --> 35:11.860
The guns are
jamming in the heat, General.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.716
Again.

35:55.404 --> 35:58.782
Yeah.
G, H minor.

36:01.118 --> 36:02.577
OK, from the beginning.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.579
It's so nice to spend
a little time together.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.998
Well, we're gonna be
spending more time together

36:06.999 --> 36:08.792
once we get to Prague.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.588
Prague?

36:13.589 --> 36:15.340
Yes.

36:16.592 --> 36:17.925
Klaus.

36:17.926 --> 36:21.888
The Führer has made
your father ReichProtektor

36:21.889 --> 36:24.600
of Bohemia and Moravia.

36:25.309 --> 36:26.893
From the beginning.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.313
Reinhard! That's...

36:45.537 --> 36:46.287
No.

36:46.288 --> 36:47.455
Watch your pedal.

36:47.456 --> 36:48.581
- Yes.
- Yeah?

36:48.582 --> 36:51.667
- How long have you known?
- Again, again, again. A month.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.502
Just pick it up again. Again.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.590
Concentrate, Klaus.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.050
A month?

36:59.051 --> 37:00.676
Why didn't you tell me?

37:00.677 --> 37:01.177
Klaus.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.261
Because it's confidential.

37:02.262 --> 37:05.265
Come on, you can do
better than this. Okay?

37:13.774 --> 37:16.360
Yes.

38:15.377 --> 38:20.257
We stand at a unique
moment in history.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.510
Prague,

38:24.511 --> 38:28.598
alongside Berlin and Vienna,

38:29.182 --> 38:31.309
has been chosen
to become the first

38:31.310 --> 38:35.105
city free of Jewry
in the new Reich.

38:36.523 --> 38:39.775
My predecessor's
policy of tolerance

38:39.776 --> 38:43.739
is no longer enough to
achieve this objective.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.575
All Jews will be required to
immediately report to the

38:47.576 --> 38:51.871
nearest police station and
required to wear a distinctive

38:51.872 --> 38:56.793
symbol testifying to their race.

38:58.795 --> 39:02.089
All Czech
resistance organizations

39:02.090 --> 39:08.472
will be destroyed and
dismantled without mercy.

39:09.598 --> 39:13.642
At the same time, we will
increase the salaries of all

39:13.643 --> 39:17.022
Czechs working in the
armaments factories.

39:18.190 --> 39:21.150
The Czech people must know

39:21.151 --> 39:24.237
that so long as
they are our friends,

39:25.697 --> 39:27.740
we will be theirs!

39:32.996 --> 39:34.706
Smile.

39:42.964 --> 39:43.964
Heil Hitler!

39:43.965 --> 39:47.386
Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

40:16.957 --> 40:18.834
You're leaving?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.502
Yes.

40:20.794 --> 40:22.671
Where are you going?

40:23.004 --> 40:24.213
Berlin.

40:24.214 --> 40:27.050
- Berlin?
- Yes.

40:27.759 --> 40:28.467
Why?

40:28.468 --> 40:29.301
Because it's Berlin.

40:29.302 --> 40:33.098
Because, I have a very
important meeting.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.268
- I see.
- Yes.

40:39.771 --> 40:40.312
Okay...

40:40.313 --> 40:42.941
Were you going to
tell me about it?

40:44.526 --> 40:48.028
Reinhardt the only reason
I know you are going is when

40:48.029 --> 40:50.282
I see your cases in the hall.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.619
I can't take it anymore.

40:55.162 --> 40:57.122
Take what?

40:57.289 --> 40:59.582
I feel you've
abandoned me here.

40:59.583 --> 41:03.837
I don't know who I am,
and I don't know who you are.

41:05.464 --> 41:06.547
Yes, well...

41:06.548 --> 41:08.215
You're doing
brilliantly, I know.

41:08.216 --> 41:12.303
But I go out in the streets
and everybody knows who I am,

41:12.304 --> 41:14.972
and I feel like some
sort of strange animal.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.765
What is it that you want?
Did you want me to--

41:16.766 --> 41:20.019
Did you, did you want to go
back to Germany, is that it?

41:20.020 --> 41:21.480
No.

41:22.022 --> 41:24.191
I want to be with you.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.233
You are with me.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.569
But I want to be with you.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.739
Yes?

41:30.947 --> 41:32.823
Thirty minutes.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.827
Thirty minutes,
is that all I get?

41:42.042 --> 41:45.419
Reinhard, you wouldn't even
be here if it wasn't for me.

41:45.420 --> 41:48.840
Have you forgotten
about our past?

41:48.965 --> 41:49.757
Who saved you?

41:49.758 --> 41:52.468
Enough! OK, enough!

41:52.469 --> 41:54.554
You are my wife.

41:58.058 --> 42:01.728
One more word and you
won't be much longer.

42:13.114 --> 42:15.367
I'm sorry.

44:24.496 --> 44:28.415
In addition to the
wider issues of methodology

44:28.416 --> 44:31.585
and timescale of the cleansing,

44:31.586 --> 44:34.421
there are important
clerical and legal

44:34.422 --> 44:37.258
decisions to be made
at this meeting.

44:37.467 --> 44:40.387
I have itemized them as follows.

44:40.512 --> 44:42.596
Please hand them around.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.475
Jews with military decoration.

44:45.558 --> 44:47.226
Half-Jews. Quarter-Jews.

44:47.227 --> 44:48.769
Jews in mixed marriages.

44:48.770 --> 44:51.480
We shall review
them all one by one.

44:51.481 --> 44:53.065
Will you please turn
to page five, gentlemen?

44:53.066 --> 44:55.401
This will give you some
idea of the task at hand.

44:55.402 --> 44:57.569
The figures from our
most recent census,

44:57.570 --> 45:00.782
dated the 1st of January 1942.

45:00.907 --> 45:04.660
Germany: 700,000,
Poland: 2 million.

45:04.661 --> 45:08.789
Latvia: 300,000,
Lithuania: 150,000.

45:08.790 --> 45:10.499
Estonia: already cleansed.

45:10.500 --> 45:14.378
Satellite countries - Slovakia:
88,000, Croatia: 40,000.

45:14.379 --> 45:17.548
Allies - Italy, including
Sardinia: 58,000.

45:17.549 --> 45:20.008
Neutral countries - 18,000.

45:20.009 --> 45:23.053
Sweden: 8,000. Turkey: 55,000.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.096
And so on down the page.

45:24.097 --> 45:29.143
The Einsatzgruppen are already
working at maximum efficiency.

45:29.144 --> 45:31.353
The elimination of between
eleven and twelve million

45:31.354 --> 45:34.398
individuals requires a
more systematic approach,

45:34.399 --> 45:37.484
requires more
advanced technology.

45:37.485 --> 45:39.695
There is much work to be done.

45:39.696 --> 45:43.949
The final solution aims to group
our Jews in concentration camps.

45:43.950 --> 45:46.994
Separated by sex, those that can
work will build roads, etcetera

45:46.995 --> 45:50.372
in these territories which
should result in a natural

45:50.373 --> 45:52.291
reduction in their
numbers. For the rest,

45:52.292 --> 45:56.962
we should apply treatment more
conducive to mass extermination.

47:07.492 --> 47:08.952
First!

47:09.369 --> 47:11.704
And in the head, look!

47:12.247 --> 47:14.874
Accept defeat, Private Gabcik.

47:38.231 --> 47:40.065
Shoot. Shoot.

47:40.066 --> 47:42.235
Yes, finish.

47:47.073 --> 47:50.909
You can come over here,
and just whisper in my ear.

47:51.452 --> 47:53.412
I can tell you Valcik,
but it's above your paygrade.

47:53.413 --> 47:56.915
Slovak to Slovak, you
tell me: you're going to go,

47:56.916 --> 47:59.084
right? You're going to go
and join The Three Kings?

47:59.085 --> 48:00.460
You're wasting
your breath Valcik.

48:00.461 --> 48:03.171
What? Why am I wasting
my breath? Jan, Jan.

48:03.172 --> 48:05.090
- Yes, what?
- Come, come.

48:05.091 --> 48:08.760
Soldier to soldier, you're going
to go, and you're going to join

48:08.761 --> 48:11.263
the resistance, you're
going to fight with Moravec.

48:11.264 --> 48:12.723
- Yes?
- Who knows?

48:12.724 --> 48:14.434
Alright Valcik.

48:14.809 --> 48:17.102
If you have to know that badly.

48:17.103 --> 48:19.980
We have been given a
mission for Valcik.

48:19.981 --> 48:23.942
We've been asked to go in,
rescue and safely bring back

48:23.943 --> 48:26.696
all of the president's suits.

48:30.116 --> 48:31.950
Fake! Fake!

48:31.951 --> 48:32.576
It's true!

48:32.577 --> 48:34.077
- You're lying, Josef.
- It's true!

48:34.078 --> 48:37.039
President Benes had to leave
the country empty handed.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.499
Now I understand.
Now I understand.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.543
Don't mock the mission, Valcik.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.254
Silence!

49:53.491 --> 49:57.786
We're about to fly
over Pilsen. Get ready!

49:57.787 --> 49:59.705
Jan and Jozef jump here.

49:59.706 --> 50:02.834
The others in 5 minutes.

50:14.137 --> 50:15.638
OK?

50:17.348 --> 50:19.434
Go! Go! Go!

51:39.965 --> 51:43.724
No, it's too tangled, Jan.

51:44.060 --> 51:47.396
Damn it!

52:48.624 --> 52:52.252
You realize the Resistance
dropped two parachutists just

52:52.253 --> 52:53.670
outside of the city last night.

52:53.671 --> 52:57.716
Yes, Obergruppenführer.
We are working on it.

52:57.717 --> 52:59.843
And where are you
with the Three Kings?

52:59.844 --> 53:02.346
Oh, we're still looking.

53:04.807 --> 53:06.308
Do you need my help?

53:06.309 --> 53:07.475
No, Obergruppenführer.

53:07.476 --> 53:10.646
Good. Let me know
when it's done.

53:11.105 --> 53:12.230
Of course.

53:46.933 --> 53:49.017
I really
thought we'd lost you.

53:49.018 --> 53:51.729
Security checks are
getting tighter.

53:52.605 --> 53:55.066
Especially going into Prague.

53:55.983 --> 54:00.071
You'll have to split up...
blend into the crowd.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.324
Now.

54:03.866 --> 54:06.202
Work certificates.

54:08.913 --> 54:09.829
Here.

54:09.830 --> 54:11.790
Wear this when you arrive.

54:11.791 --> 54:14.209
Your contact will know you.
Here.

54:14.210 --> 54:15.670
Okay.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.873
Daniel?

54:57.837 --> 54:59.505
You.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.424
Your papers.

55:07.263 --> 55:09.389
Which plumber do you work for?

55:09.390 --> 55:11.267
Lipanska.

56:14.455 --> 56:16.624
This is my family.

56:18.376 --> 56:20.335
Say hello to your cousin.

56:20.336 --> 56:22.462
Hello. Josef.

56:22.463 --> 56:24.882
- Hello.
- Hello.

56:39.230 --> 56:41.690
We don't talk in front of them.

56:43.192 --> 56:44.984
Actually, don't talk at all.

56:44.985 --> 56:47.278
Everyone is a potential enemy.

56:47.279 --> 56:49.197
The Nazis starved us.

56:49.198 --> 56:52.784
Then they told us
information was priceless.

56:52.785 --> 56:56.038
That's how they turn
people against each other.

56:56.622 --> 56:58.374
Thank you.

57:03.462 --> 57:06.048
Your friend is safe.

57:16.684 --> 57:19.686
Tonight you will sleep here,
but tomorrow,

57:19.687 --> 57:22.147
both of you will
join a new family.

57:28.404 --> 57:31.322
Since they spotted the airplane,
the Nazis have been

57:31.323 --> 57:33.868
tailing us constantly.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.454
Heydrich wants the heads
of the Three Kings.

57:37.455 --> 57:38.329
I still need to meet them.

57:38.330 --> 57:42.250
Yes of course.
I will tell you where and when.

57:42.251 --> 57:46.464
First, a contact from your
new family will meet you.

57:50.176 --> 57:51.509
Sorry, we are closed.

57:51.510 --> 57:54.346
Oh, I just
want a quick shampoo.

57:55.014 --> 57:58.516
Don't worry. I'll take
care of him, close up after.

57:58.517 --> 58:00.352
Suit yourself.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.113
I've been waiting for you.

58:13.866 --> 58:17.411
Please, sit there.
We will do the shampoo.

59:10.422 --> 59:13.050
You can come in now.

59:16.178 --> 59:19.682
If you need anything
else, just ask.

59:20.432 --> 59:23.852
My wife's left some
clothes on the bed for you.

59:24.395 --> 59:27.939
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you, Mr. Novak.

59:27.940 --> 59:30.234
Good night.

59:42.371 --> 59:44.415
Go to your room!

59:51.630 --> 59:53.173
Pillows.

59:59.138 --> 01:00:01.014
Normally this is my room,

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:04.059
but I'm going to
sleep with my sister.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:13.109
It's a good cover if we walk
through the city together.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.279
This is true, yes.

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:28.042
Don't tell father.

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:20.843
Where is he?

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:25.140
Talk to me! Huh?
Where is he? Where?

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:29.728
Reichprotektor.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:35.024
Josef Masin, he
can hear me, yes?

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.652
Yes, he can.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.780
Josef.

01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:44.702
It is Heydrich,
the Reichprotektor.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:49.206
Yes.

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:54.878
Vaclav Moravec, where is he?

01:01:58.382 --> 01:01:59.633
No.

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:03.428
Stand up.

01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:05.430
- He's paralyzed.
- He's what?

01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:06.055
He's paralyzed.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:08.308
Then get him up!

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:15.357
Josef.

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:18.109
Where are the parachutists?

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.320
What do they want?

01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:22.822
What does England want, Josef?

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:25.868
Vaclav Moravec, where is he?

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.998
Long live Czechoslovakia!

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:38.756
Long live Czechoslovakia!

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:44.344
There are THREE Kings,
gentlemen.

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:48.848
Find Moravec.

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:28.138
Jan!

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:33.267
- I'm glad to see you my friend.
- Oh yeah?

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:36.229
- How are you?
- I'm good. And you?

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:39.732
Yeah? I'm OK.
I've been reading books.

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:41.692
- You've been reading?
- Yes.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:42.860
I don't believe it.

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.070
Oh. These old people,

01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:45.947
they just drink tea
and play bridge all day.

01:03:45.948 --> 01:03:49.784
I'm going out of my mind.
I'm starting to miss England.

01:03:49.785 --> 01:03:52.037
You poor thing.

01:03:53.956 --> 01:03:56.123
- What's that face?
- Huh?

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:58.876
- What's that face?
- What face? It's my face.

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:01.420
You've seen some action
already, haven't you?

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:04.131
- No.
- Hm-hm.

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:06.384
Don't lie to me, Jan.

01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:08.637
Smell this.
Smell.

01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:13.224
- You smell like lavender.
- Lavender!

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:14.559
Did you know there's a war on?

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.395
Where are you getting
lavender shampoo?

01:04:17.396 --> 01:04:18.814
Hey.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.611
That's Moravec.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.214
Please, sit down.

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:51.013
Something serious has happened.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:53.973
The SS found our hideout.

01:04:53.974 --> 01:04:58.854
They killed Balaban, and Masin
must be dead by now, too.

01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:02.316
I'm the last of The
Three Kings left.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:06.904
And apparently, Heydrich has
heard about your operation.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:10.323
He's desperately trying to
find out why you're here.

01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:12.617
He'll know soon enough, sir.

01:05:12.618 --> 01:05:14.369
Listen to me.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:20.042
This is not just any old mission
London has entrusted you with.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:22.544
Understand me?

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.297
Yes, sir.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:30.093
Do you have one of these?

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:41.145
I know someone who can
fill you in about Heydrich.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:43.230
When can we meet him?

01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:45.025
Tomorrow.

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:47.778
Prepare the operation.

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:53.784
As soon as you're ready, I'll
tell you about your escape plan.

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.497
You can leave now.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:02.124
Sir.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.710
What do you
do at the chateau?

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:07.089
I take care of the house.

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:08.547
And you work there all week?

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:12.343
Yes. From dawn until,
Mrs. Heydrich tells me to leave.

01:06:12.344 --> 01:06:12.969
Usually quite late.

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.347
I want you to make a note
of the time that he leaves,

01:06:16.348 --> 01:06:19.475
and the time that he comes back.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:23.521
You'll add a tick, depending
if he has an escort or not.

01:06:23.522 --> 01:06:28.526
You will pass on the information
to a contact of your own choice.

01:06:28.527 --> 01:06:31.028
Think of someone in the suburbs
in the north of the city, where

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:35.324
the soldiers never go for fear
of getting their boots dirty.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:38.327
Josef will come in person to
pick up the information every

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:43.250
afternoon at 5:00 at the
tram stop on Tolska street.

01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:55.970
I want to know
every move he makes.

01:06:55.971 --> 01:06:59.015
I want to know all
his little habits.

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:33.049
You look good today.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:49.441
Your leaving yourself open.

01:07:52.194 --> 01:07:54.446
So I found a place.

01:07:55.447 --> 01:07:58.657
It will be on the bend
on a road on the outskirts of

01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:01.577
town where he passes every day.
Ten o'clock.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.621
Every day, you'll see,
it's like clockwork.

01:08:03.622 --> 01:08:07.124
Ideally we would make a
triangle, so somebody could

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:09.502
stand on the top of
the bend as a lookout.

01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:12.213
We'll need three to make a
triangle, though, don't we?

01:08:12.214 --> 01:08:14.757
Yes, well I'll ask
Moravec for another man.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.634
Moravec?
Have you heard from him?

01:08:16.635 --> 01:08:18.344
- No, but we will.
- I hope so, Jan,

01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:22.224
because without him, we're not
going to get out of Prague.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.645
Dance with me!

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.563
Dance? No, no.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.033
Josef's Slovakian, isn't he?

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:43.993
How did you two meet?

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:47.249
In Poland, two years ago.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:52.754
I'd just escaped across the
border to join the Free Army.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:57.758
I hitched a ride in the
back of a farm truck.

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.343
Josef was in the back.

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:02.430
He talked all the
bloody way to Krakow.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.523
Promise me you'll get out alive.

01:09:49.728 --> 01:09:52.645
Moravec's inside.
There's no way out.

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:54.649
Good. Get him.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.985
Go in!

01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:50.914
Your Three Kings are dead.

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:53.749
The resistance is finished.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:58.213
Go home, tell your families,
tell your friends, it's over.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.983
Valcik!

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.486
Valcik!

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.031
What?

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:08.908
Read this.

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:13.412
Jesus!

01:12:13.413 --> 01:12:15.372
We had a
message from London.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:20.711
We are all Czech here, so
this concerns all of us.

01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:24.798
If you kill Heydrich, you're
not only putting your own lives

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:28.887
in danger, but the lives
of everyone in this room.

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:31.930
And think about the people.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.892
You know what the reprisals
will be if you succeed.

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:37.811
Forget about
orders from London.

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:40.314
This is about our futures.

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:42.566
He's right, Jan.

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:45.069
Think about your loved ones.

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:48.114
Think about what
they will go through.

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:52.577
Think about my loved ones?

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:54.787
I do.

01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:57.457
I do think about my loved ones.

01:12:57.916 --> 01:13:02.337
Sometimes I wish they even
chose somebody else to do this.

01:13:04.255 --> 01:13:07.717
So, give up the mission, Jan.

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:11.178
Heydrich must die.

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:12.930
At any... At any price?

01:13:12.931 --> 01:13:16.393
You talk about the resistance.
We talk about the...

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:17.935
all the people in this room.

01:13:17.936 --> 01:13:19.228
What do you think
we're here for, Opalka?

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:22.147
You don't think about everybody
else who has to live here too?

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:23.607
Curda,
we are fighting a war.

01:13:23.608 --> 01:13:25.359
I know what we
are fighting, Jan.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.403
But this won't change the war.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:28.737
This won't change anything.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:29.655
Curda, you are wrong.

01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:31.615
Not one high-ranking Nazi
official has ever been

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:35.744
assassinated by any
Resistance across Europe.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.496
- This is crazy.
- It is our job,

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.332
our duty as men,
as soldiers to do something.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:43.210
The world has to see
that they are not invincible.

01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:44.044
OK, I agree.

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:44.711
For what end?

01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:47.881
And the world has to see
that Czechoslovakia will fight.

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:48.799
We did not fight.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.927
And this is a suicide
mission, there is no way out.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:56.141
This is why I'm asking,
if you do this,

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:59.978
that you understand,
that you are sure.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:03.355
I think the talk is over.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:05.983
Jan and I are going
to kill Heydrich.

01:14:05.984 --> 01:14:08.444
Valcik is going to help us.

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:12.323
Are you going to help us,
or are you going to sit by?

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.579
I will not sit by.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:24.085
I'll help you succeed.

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.884
For Czechoslovakia.

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.928
Good luck to all of you.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:37.885
Amen.

01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:08.322
Ugh!

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:20.459
Ugh!

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.055
Ooohh!

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:41.832
Damn it!

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:43.416
Argh!

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.808
Argh! Argh!

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:19.369
The bike, the bike.
I left the bike.

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:22.205
- Oh my god. You need a doctor.
- ... halfway down on street.

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:23.415
- Halfway down.
- You need a doctor!

01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:25.792
The bike cannot stay there,
please Anna, please.

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:27.503
Okay, okay, okay.

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:39.305
How could you let this happen?

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:39.931
How?

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:40.807
I assure you we're doing...

01:23:40.808 --> 01:23:44.520
You were supposed to
protect him! Nothing else.

01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:48.816
Where is he?

01:24:55.633 --> 01:24:57.050
They are coming.

01:24:57.051 --> 01:24:57.634
What?

01:24:57.635 --> 01:24:59.595
They are coming!

01:25:12.358 --> 01:25:13.650
What are you doing?

01:25:13.651 --> 01:25:15.193
What is the meaning of this?

01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:16.111
He is my doctor.

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:18.321
This young woman is asthmatic.
She needs...

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:19.948
With injured papers?

01:25:19.949 --> 01:25:22.827
She needs daily attention.

01:25:35.673 --> 01:25:38.509
They're not here!

01:25:46.851 --> 01:25:48.059
Anna!

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.561
- Did they go?
- Yes.

01:25:49.562 --> 01:25:52.105
- Definitely?
- Yes! Are you alright?

01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:54.274
- Yes and you?
- Fine.

01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:15.211
They're everywhere!

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:16.838
- You're alright?
- Yes.

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:18.132
Okay.

01:26:41.572 --> 01:26:44.825
I'll come back for you.

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:53.268
So close.

01:27:53.269 --> 01:27:56.063
Yeah.
Okay, okay. Yeah?

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.114
Yeah.

01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:17.750
Mum?

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:19.753
Yeah.

01:28:23.007 --> 01:28:24.632
What is it?

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:27.553
What happened to the cousins?

01:28:30.848 --> 01:28:33.559
Never talk about them.

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:35.728
Do you hear me?

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:37.896
Never!

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.648
Okay.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:48.949
I'll come back in an hour.

01:28:49.867 --> 01:28:52.453
I'm going to the church.

01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:58.333
When we get out of here,
you know what I'm going to do?

01:28:58.334 --> 01:28:59.542
What?

01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:04.464
I'm going to win the war, marry
Libiana and take her to America.

01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:08.844
Whoa! But, I thought
that was just a cover story.

01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:13.223
Well, I change my mind.

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:17.853
What about you, what
you'll going to do?

01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:20.355
Come to America?

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:21.690
No.

01:29:22.066 --> 01:29:24.526
I want to live here.

01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:26.862
In a free country.

01:29:29.615 --> 01:29:31.866
In a free country.

01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:53.429
You'll have to leave
the country in these coffins.

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:56.015
So? How do you feel?

01:29:56.016 --> 01:29:58.351
This will work.

01:29:58.352 --> 01:30:00.311
Good.

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:02.230
OK, give me a hand, will you?

01:30:02.231 --> 01:30:05.692
We have to move them
down to the crypt.

01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:13.534
Our chi--

01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:16.619
Our children...

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.622
Tell me.

01:30:19.123 --> 01:30:21.041
Raise...

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:24.503
raise our children...

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.923
as...

01:30:29.299 --> 01:30:31.885
good Aryans...

01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:36.390
worthy of the name.

01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:39.476
Yes. Yes.

01:30:40.727 --> 01:30:43.480
Good Germans...

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:49.862
How will I live without you?

01:30:53.824 --> 01:30:58.077
Just believe in the Führer.

01:31:01.832 --> 01:31:04.209
Himmler is here.

01:31:28.609 --> 01:31:30.068
Thank you.

01:31:46.585 --> 01:31:48.587
For the Führer...

01:32:06.605 --> 01:32:10.859
My father wrote an opera...

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:20.369
There is a line
that I remember...

01:32:20.911 --> 01:32:25.290
'The world is a barrel organ.

01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:31.004
God turns the wheel.

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:36.426
And we all dance to his music.'

01:32:45.602 --> 01:32:48.146
Make them dance.

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:14.673
No.

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:56.733
Names.

01:34:58.819 --> 01:35:01.154
Names now!

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:03.824
Kralova.

01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:06.284
Mucha.

01:35:06.743 --> 01:35:08.578
Gross.

01:35:09.162 --> 01:35:11.498
Velezy.

01:35:12.874 --> 01:35:15.293
Jan Guzira.

01:35:16.086 --> 01:35:18.171
Jan Mikalas.

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.756
Fire!

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:26.680
There is a village
outside Prague called Lidice.

01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:29.765
Some families there have
sons in the Czech army

01:35:29.766 --> 01:35:32.853
who escaped to
join England in '38.

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:36.605
But we aren't sure if
any of them were involved

01:35:36.606 --> 01:35:38.734
in the assassination.

01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:43.029
Does it really matter?

01:35:53.457 --> 01:35:55.625
Attention.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:58.586
Fire!

01:36:00.130 --> 01:36:01.381
Fire!

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:02.924
Fire!

01:36:07.596 --> 01:36:11.223
This is a message to
the people of Bohemia-Moravia.

01:36:11.224 --> 01:36:14.977
Anyone with any information
concerning the murder of the

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:19.565
Reichprotektor who does
not come forward at once

01:36:19.566 --> 01:36:20.858
will be executed.

01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:26.323
And the entire village of
Lidice has paid for these acts.

01:36:26.490 --> 01:36:28.157
The men have been shot.

01:36:28.158 --> 01:36:31.076
The women and children
are in prison.

01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:34.914
This is a message to the
people of Bohemia-Moravia.

01:36:34.915 --> 01:36:39.043
Anyone with any information
concerning the murder of the

01:36:39.044 --> 01:36:43.547
Reichprotektor who does
not come forward at once

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:46.008
will be executed.

01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:49.929
Anyone who helps the
regime will be rewarded.

01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:53.641
This is a message to the
people of Bohemia-Moravia.

01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:57.520
It won't stop.

01:36:57.521 --> 01:37:01.107
We have to hand ourselves in.

01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:05.862
And they will kill us all.

01:37:06.321 --> 01:37:07.739
Yes.

01:37:08.698 --> 01:37:10.408
No.

01:37:37.394 --> 01:37:39.020
Halt!

01:37:39.813 --> 01:37:41.397
My name is Karel Curda.

01:37:41.398 --> 01:37:44.733
I have information
concerning the parachutists

01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:46.987
who killed the Protector.

01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:26.396
Now, you can make it stop.

01:40:30.734 --> 01:40:32.943
- Burn his eyes!
- No!

01:40:32.944 --> 01:40:34.903
Now!
Burn them!

01:40:34.904 --> 01:40:37.740
No! Please, no! No!

01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:39.283
You will talk now!

01:40:39.284 --> 01:40:41.452
- No! No!
- Tell me!

01:40:41.453 --> 01:40:43.579
You're telling me now!

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:46.166
You are going to talk to me!

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:49.252
Answer me.

01:40:50.253 --> 01:40:52.004
You want it to stop?

01:40:52.005 --> 01:40:55.050
You want this to stop?

01:40:55.592 --> 01:40:58.261
You want this to stop?

01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:05.143
For the last time,
tell me where they are.

01:41:07.437 --> 01:41:09.147
Tell me!

01:41:10.774 --> 01:41:12.817
The church.

01:43:03.052 --> 01:43:04.721
Go!

01:48:32.632 --> 01:48:35.051
There's two missing.

01:48:44.936 --> 01:48:47.146
I want them alive!

01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:18.761
Give yourselves up!

01:49:19.762 --> 01:49:22.347
Josef! What are you doing?

01:49:22.348 --> 01:49:24.641
There has to be a sewer.

01:49:24.642 --> 01:49:28.395
Under the street. We just
have to dig our way through.

01:49:28.396 --> 01:49:30.898
I think there's one here.
Come on!

01:50:47.683 --> 01:50:49.685
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:50:54.899 --> 01:50:56.400
Grenade!

01:51:08.663 --> 01:51:10.873
Josef? Josef?

01:51:16.045 --> 01:51:17.880
Josef!

01:51:19.298 --> 01:51:21.549
You're good? Good?
You're okay?

01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:23.635
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.472
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:51:40.027 --> 01:51:42.905
The hole's bigger!
Come on!

01:51:57.878 --> 01:51:59.296
Come on!

01:52:11.267 --> 01:52:13.560
Come on!
what are you doing?

01:52:13.561 --> 01:52:16.939
Josef...
Josef. Stop!

01:52:20.901 --> 01:52:22.361
Jan!

01:52:27.867 --> 01:52:30.077
What are you doing?

01:52:30.828 --> 01:52:32.371
Look.

01:52:34.582 --> 01:52:37.292
It's rising too fast, Josef.

01:52:38.753 --> 01:52:41.672
And we have six bullets.

01:52:43.174 --> 01:52:45.634
What about America?

01:52:45.885 --> 01:52:50.055
There's a sewer, right there!
There's a fucking sewer, Jan!

01:52:50.973 --> 01:52:52.975
Come on!

01:53:50.908 --> 01:53:52.408
Hey! Hey.

01:53:52.409 --> 01:53:55.996
I'll see you on the
other side, my friend.

01:54:00.876 --> 01:54:03.044
Listen to me, OK?

01:54:03.045 --> 01:54:08.175
With me, with me...
We'll follow the sun. Okay?

01:54:08.467 --> 01:54:10.718
With me. With me.

01:55:15.951 --> 01:55:19.204
To Krakov?
May I?

01:55:26.795 --> 01:55:28.463
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:55:28.464 --> 01:55:30.965
- You going to Krakow?
- Yes.

01:55:30.966 --> 01:55:33.051
- Josef Gabcik.
- Jan Kubis.

01:55:33.052 --> 01:55:36.387
Pleased to meet you Jan Kubis.
Do you smoke?

01:55:36.388 --> 01:55:38.306
Yes I do.
Lots and lots.

01:55:38.307 --> 01:55:40.351
Lots and lots and lots.
