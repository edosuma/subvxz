00:17.278 --> 00:18.545
Selina:
<i>Andrew, you know what?</i>

00:18.580 --> 00:21.482
<i>You resented my success</i>
<i>when we were married, okay?</i>

00:21.516 --> 00:24.319
But now it is
absolutely eating you raw.

00:24.354 --> 00:25.921
You were the best thing to ever
happen to him and he threw it away.

00:25.956 --> 00:27.690
Yeah, you were the best thing--
I was the best thing

00:27.725 --> 00:29.727
that ever happened to you
and you just threw it away.

00:29.761 --> 00:32.029
Ma'am, we have to go now if you want
to catch Kent for a hostages meeting.

00:32.064 --> 00:34.633
Okay, listen,
I will not have you

00:34.668 --> 00:36.403
undermine me with Catherine.

00:36.438 --> 00:38.673
- Will you be wanting a clutch?
- I will.

00:38.707 --> 00:40.575
- Okay.
- I will not.

00:40.610 --> 00:42.911
- Oh, you don't?
- No, no, I will. I want the bag.

00:42.945 --> 00:45.481
No, I want Catherine
to spend Thanksgiving with me,

00:45.516 --> 00:47.116
not some random boyfriend.

00:47.151 --> 00:50.822
And what about poor Memaw, who's
guaranteed to be dead by March?

00:50.856 --> 00:52.424
( quietly ) With any luck.

00:52.458 --> 00:53.692
Well, congratulations.

00:53.727 --> 00:56.496
You have successfully learned
how to manipulate Catherine.

00:56.531 --> 00:59.501
How is that insulting to her?

00:59.535 --> 01:01.837
God, you just turn it
all around-- okay.

01:01.871 --> 01:04.272
- Just hanging up on him.
- Shall we go?

01:04.307 --> 01:05.541
- Yeah, let's just get out.
- There's some Advil in the bag.

01:05.575 --> 01:07.677
Yeah, I hope we have a number
for a contract killer, too.

01:07.711 --> 01:09.179
( laughs ) I'll do it.

01:10.314 --> 01:13.550
Nice wheels, Mike.
This new?

01:13.585 --> 01:15.152
Not quite.
Like your mother,

01:15.186 --> 01:18.455
it's been previously loved and
paid for by a couple of guys.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.190
I guess this means
you cleared your debts, huh?

01:20.225 --> 01:22.659
No, I've added this to my debt.

01:22.694 --> 01:25.797
Oh, the old "drink your way
out of alcoholism" approach.

01:25.831 --> 01:29.335
- I like it.
- No, this isn't like when I drank.

01:29.369 --> 01:31.604
You had a drinking problem?

01:31.638 --> 01:34.007
Not a problem.
Uh, an issue.

01:34.041 --> 01:36.176
Not even an issue.
A hitch.

01:36.210 --> 01:37.845
You had a drinking hitch?

01:37.879 --> 01:39.947
Dan, I owe 100 grand.

01:39.981 --> 01:42.250
Nothing I can do
will change that.

01:42.284 --> 01:44.820
So, I've accepted
what I cannot change.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.622
A few extra grand
doesn't matter.

01:46.656 --> 01:48.657
Are you drunk right now?

01:48.692 --> 01:50.827
Morning, Mr. Egan. Have you
read the regionality paper?

01:50.861 --> 01:52.662
- No.
- Okay.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.765
Have a great day.

01:54.832 --> 01:57.168
- I get that all the time.
- No, you don't.

01:57.202 --> 01:58.703
Selina:
<i>But I need to talk</i>

01:58.738 --> 02:01.406
to that autistic lumberjack
son of a bitch.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.141
Oh, there he is.
Hi, Kent.

02:03.176 --> 02:05.945
- Madam Vice President.
- Hey, I heard you were doing Pilates.

02:05.979 --> 02:07.580
I didn't know you had a core.
( laughs )

02:07.648 --> 02:09.247
I do and it's like steel.

02:09.282 --> 02:11.985
So are we really
not doing anything

02:12.020 --> 02:13.654
about the hostages now?

02:13.688 --> 02:16.724
- Nothing at all?
- We are doing something.

02:16.758 --> 02:18.359
- Yeah? What are we doing?
- Nothing.

02:18.393 --> 02:20.227
Until the numbers
support intervention,

02:20.262 --> 02:22.630
doing nothing is the most
positive thing we can do.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.066
You know, it's just so great
talking to you, Kent.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.968
I love being close
to the inaction.

02:27.002 --> 02:29.104
The national security meeting this
afternoon is still happening, right?

02:29.138 --> 02:33.309
Yes, 4:30. Hostages and the SM-17
missile defense system sale

02:33.343 --> 02:35.245
to Israel will both
be discussed.

02:35.279 --> 02:37.347
SM-17d.
There's a lower case D.

02:37.381 --> 02:39.116
- Apologies, sir.
- Details are important.

02:39.150 --> 02:42.553
- A misplaced decimal point
can kill a diabetic. - Yes, sir.

02:42.587 --> 02:44.889
I look forward to attending
the meeting as per our deal.

02:44.923 --> 02:46.891
POTUS would love to have
you there, as would I.

02:46.925 --> 02:49.594
That's if you can
possibly be back in time.

02:49.662 --> 02:52.097
- Back in time from what?
- I'm sorry, I have an 8:45.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.432
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yes, sir.

02:53.466 --> 02:56.035
- What? Kent?
- Uh, ma'am.

02:56.069 --> 02:58.270
- Yes?
- The Listen to Rural America program

02:58.304 --> 03:00.706
that you okayed with POTUS after
the midterms is looking--

03:00.740 --> 03:03.075
You know what? Why don't you
put on your running shoes

03:03.109 --> 03:05.311
and get to the fucking
point, Jonah?

03:05.345 --> 03:07.665
The North Carolina Pork Board
is having a pig picking today.

03:07.682 --> 03:09.816
Sounds classy. Will Kate
Middleton be there?

03:09.850 --> 03:11.351
POTUS would like
to get you down there

03:11.385 --> 03:14.521
and utilize your people skills
to kick off "U.S., Hey."

03:14.556 --> 03:16.457
- That's what they're gonna call it?
- Yeah.

03:16.491 --> 03:18.326
Who came up with that
incredibly shitty name?

03:18.360 --> 03:19.861
That would be me, ma'am.

03:19.895 --> 03:22.430
Okay, so they want me
to go to a pig roast

03:22.465 --> 03:25.467
to meet a bunch of men
who probably took turns

03:25.501 --> 03:28.203
to fuck the pig
before they roasted it?

03:28.238 --> 03:29.705
I wouldn't presume
they took turns.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.981
Let me tell you something.
I'm going to that 4:30 meeting

03:32.009 --> 03:34.411
even if I have to get Sue
to fly around the world

03:34.445 --> 03:36.479
the wrong way like Superman
and reverse time.

03:36.514 --> 03:38.248
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, ma'am.

03:38.282 --> 03:39.783
Okay.

03:39.817 --> 03:43.420
Ma'am, my dad has taken
a turn for the worse.

03:43.455 --> 03:45.589
I'm thinking this pig picking
is a good opportunity--

03:45.623 --> 03:47.024
Oh, yeah, skip it.
Skip it. Go to him.

03:47.058 --> 03:49.793
I'll bring you back a sandwich
and a six-toed husband.

03:49.828 --> 03:52.830
- Maybe if she landed at a different base--
- Gary.

03:52.864 --> 03:55.232
This is not your area
of expertise.

03:55.266 --> 03:57.701
It's just typing
into a calendar.

03:57.735 --> 04:00.270
I'm sorry, Sue. Your job
is really difficult.

04:00.304 --> 04:02.438
- Excuse me?
- You do it very efficiently.

04:02.472 --> 04:04.407
- Selina: <i>Gary.</i>
- Oh, thank you, Jesus.

04:04.441 --> 04:06.809
We got to go. We're gonna
go mix with the hicks.

04:06.843 --> 04:09.378
Congressman Furlong called and
he'd like some face time.

04:09.412 --> 04:12.514
Okay, well, let's see, I'd
rather set fire to my vulva.

04:12.549 --> 04:15.618
- So that's a no.
- Amy: He's in town trying to play nice

04:15.652 --> 04:18.254
- for a possible Senate run in the next year or so.
- Seriously?

04:18.289 --> 04:20.890
Roger Furlong trying to play nice is
like Brando trying to play Annie.

04:20.925 --> 04:22.258
- That's a good one, Mike.
- <i>( phone chimes )</i>

04:22.293 --> 04:24.560
- Thanks, ma'am.
- Wait. Ma'am?

04:24.595 --> 04:26.662
I just got a message here.
Something about a paper

04:26.697 --> 04:28.664
that your daughter wrote that
ended up on some guy's blog.

04:28.698 --> 04:32.001
See, this is why China regulates their Internet.
What does it say?

04:32.036 --> 04:34.404
I don't know. Some film studies course.
A paper she wrote.

04:34.438 --> 04:36.705
Did you know that I'm paying 65
grand a year to that school?

04:36.740 --> 04:39.608
They had better be putting gold on
that popcorn instead of butter, right?

04:39.642 --> 04:42.244
- Jonah: <i>Oh, ma'am!</i>
- What? Oh, no.

04:42.278 --> 04:44.546
- I'm out of here.
- I'm coming with you.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.682
- What?
- POTUS wants me to monitor U.S. Hey

04:47.717 --> 04:50.152
- as kind of my pet project.
- Oh, for fuck's sakes.

04:50.186 --> 04:52.020
This must be the first
pet project of yours

04:52.054 --> 04:54.022
that didn't involve
resorting to chloroform.

04:54.056 --> 04:56.258
Yeah, well,
it's early days, Mike.

04:56.292 --> 04:57.692
Can you take care
of this Catherine business?

04:57.726 --> 04:59.861
- I've got someplace I've got to be.
- Where?

04:59.895 --> 05:03.198
Well, I think I might have found
a way to get to Kent Davison.

05:03.232 --> 05:06.635
If you kill his mother and then dress in
her skin, that's technically illegal.

05:06.669 --> 05:08.537
Technically.

05:10.173 --> 05:12.241
The veep's office is pumped

05:12.275 --> 05:14.443
about the new foreign
policy portfolio, sir.

05:17.081 --> 05:18.982
And I read this really
interesting paper

05:19.016 --> 05:21.318
on how regionality

05:21.386 --> 05:24.988
is actually a more significant
political prism than nationality.

05:25.023 --> 05:28.258
Did you just join this
Pilates studio, Mr. Egan?

05:28.292 --> 05:30.794
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
it's convenient.

05:30.829 --> 05:33.430
- Where do you live?
- Nearby.

05:33.464 --> 05:36.500
Local to here.

05:39.704 --> 05:43.072
I hear the hostage situation
is really heating up.

05:43.107 --> 05:44.541
I hope you've done
Pilates before.

05:44.575 --> 05:47.511
People think they can just
get on one of these machines.

05:47.545 --> 05:50.948
No. Six months I did
before I got on this.

05:50.982 --> 05:55.319
Yeah, well, I'm all about
the long-term goals.

06:00.759 --> 06:02.393
Mike, look at this.

06:04.029 --> 06:05.896
Look at this, Mike.

06:08.266 --> 06:09.900
Just sipping some coffee.
Air Force Two.

06:09.935 --> 06:12.937
Real good. Take a picture of
me looking out the window.

06:12.971 --> 06:14.505
Jonah.
Jonah, calm down.

06:14.539 --> 06:17.041
It's a plane with a logo.
It's not Space Mountain.

06:17.075 --> 06:19.944
What the hell do you do on Air Force
One, rub your dick on the seats?

06:21.581 --> 06:23.482
I haven't actually
been on Air Force One.

06:23.516 --> 06:24.917
- What?
- I haven't been--

06:24.951 --> 06:26.818
<i>Oh!</i>

06:26.853 --> 06:28.787
- Ma'am.
- Ugh.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.290
- How you doing, Mike?
- I'm doing great, ma'am.

06:32.324 --> 06:34.559
Heard about your
financial situation.

06:34.593 --> 06:36.327
You know, the boat
and everything.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.628
It's fine.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.463
I've changed
the only thing I can--

06:39.498 --> 06:40.998
my reaction to things.

06:41.032 --> 06:43.266
Oh. And your boxers
occasionally, I hope.

06:43.301 --> 06:44.634
I have a fresh pair
every day now.

06:44.669 --> 06:46.169
Oh, good for you, Mike.

06:46.204 --> 06:48.772
- ( laughs )
- Hey, ma'am?

06:48.807 --> 06:50.541
What, Gary?
What's wrong?

06:50.575 --> 06:53.076
I know you think
I'm melodramatic, ma'am.

06:53.111 --> 06:54.945
I know you're melodramatic.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.681
Uh-huh.
Our world has just ended.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.990
Mike!

07:06.826 --> 07:08.694
Read this.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.763
What is this?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.868
Mike: <i>"Revealed: Selina's
secret stash of signals.</i>

07:16.936 --> 07:19.037
When the VP rubs her right
ear, an aide will tell her

07:19.072 --> 07:21.073
she has an important call
that she must take.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.976
In an unwanted conversation,
this is her exit strategy."

07:24.010 --> 07:27.746
All right, well, somebody
WikiLeaked the code.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.148
So we can't use those.
We need new signals.

07:30.182 --> 07:31.716
Those signals took years.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.485
I can't just tear up
the gestictionary

07:33.519 --> 07:35.220
- and come up with new codes like that.
- ( snaps fingers )

07:35.254 --> 07:37.222
Okay, that could be a signal.
Kind of a silent click.

07:37.256 --> 07:38.857
Would you please--
okay, could you just--

07:38.858 --> 07:40.338
I just need something
basic for today.

07:40.359 --> 07:42.427
I don't want to get
stuck talking pig shit

07:42.461 --> 07:44.328
with people who use
hay as furniture.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.364
<i>I need an exit strategy</i>

07:46.398 --> 07:48.332
to be in DC by 4:30,
so start thinking.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.568
Okay, but we have to make
these new signals subtle

07:50.603 --> 07:53.337
so they don't kind of
look like signals.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.406
You do realize that
that was the point

07:55.441 --> 07:58.276
- of the old signals, right, Mike?
- I realize that.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.112
Oh! You slap
your hands together.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.747
Kind of give it
a little thumbs up.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.215
No, that's like
I squished a bug

08:03.250 --> 08:05.017
and then I said, "Oh, it's
so cool I squished a bug."

08:05.051 --> 08:07.720
What if you scratched your head
with your phone in your hand?

08:07.755 --> 08:09.956
What about this?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.424
Gary:
<i>Oh. No...</i>

08:11.458 --> 08:13.559
- Mike: You don't look pretty.
- Oh, forget it.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.161
I got it. You can
rub your eyebrow.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.862
No one will see that.
It's subtle.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.130
Mike:
<i>It looks natural.</i>

08:18.164 --> 08:20.132
What if people think
I have crabs in my eyebrows?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.601
How can you have crabs
in your eyebrow?

08:22.636 --> 08:24.470
Okay, Gary, when a man
and a woman

08:24.505 --> 08:27.073
love each other very much
and it's the man's birthday--

08:27.107 --> 08:29.676
- Mike: <i>Crap in a hat.</i>
- What?

08:29.743 --> 08:31.944
- It's your daughter.
- What? What is it?

08:31.979 --> 08:35.280
She's fine, but she's done something
that'll make you want to kill her.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.352
Christ, it's everywhere.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.488
Well, if it's just
a film studies essay--

08:41.523 --> 08:43.390
No, Catherine's essay is about

08:43.424 --> 08:45.927
Emad Burnat's movie
"5 Broken Cameras."

08:45.961 --> 08:47.628
If Owen Wilson's not in it,
I probably don't know it.

08:47.663 --> 08:49.697
It's about nonviolent
Palestinian resistance

08:49.731 --> 08:51.365
to Israeli settlement
on the West Bank.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.967
That doesn't sound
like one of Owen's.

08:53.001 --> 08:54.435
She talks about
the masterly portrayal

08:54.469 --> 08:56.971
of brutal, illegal
Israeli aggression.

08:57.005 --> 08:59.774
- Ouch.
- We have to issue a statement.

08:59.808 --> 09:02.476
All right, well,
standard issue pro-Israeli,

09:02.510 --> 09:05.212
pro-Palestinian, but subtly
more pro-Israeli statement.

09:05.279 --> 09:06.880
I mean, hit F9 and print
that fucker out.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.482
No, this needs
to be top-notch.

09:08.550 --> 09:09.783
This needs to be
the Gettysburg Address

09:09.818 --> 09:11.685
of tightrope-walking,
say-nothing bullshit.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.854
My time has come.

09:13.888 --> 09:17.958
All right, well, next election
I guess we lose Florida, then.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.559
We got wheels down in 15.

09:19.594 --> 09:20.754
All right, I've got to change.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.861
All right, I'll text Amy.

09:21.896 --> 09:24.030
Gary, what am I
supposed to wear today?

09:24.065 --> 09:25.932
( gasps ) At least that's good.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.167
Well, howdy, y'all.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.901
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>

09:29.936 --> 09:31.837
Walking the walk,
talking the pork.

09:31.871 --> 09:34.239
Look at you, a grown
woman with cotton candy.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.674
Pink like your cheeks. I'm
gonna give you both a hug.

09:36.708 --> 09:39.176
Oh, gosh, that looks
like finger-licking fun.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.412
That's a term I just coined today.
Do you like it?

09:41.446 --> 09:43.681
Everybody's having such a good time.
But this young man

09:43.715 --> 09:45.949
doesn't have anything to eat.
Now why would that be?

09:45.984 --> 09:48.484
I hope you're not just
starving to death, sweetheart.

09:48.519 --> 09:50.760
What's going on? We've got to
get some meat on your bones.

09:50.787 --> 09:52.488
And there you go.

09:52.522 --> 09:54.589
Ask and you shall receive.

09:54.624 --> 09:57.192
Why am I the only one
wearing a cowboy hat?

09:57.226 --> 09:58.893
I'm gonna take this hat off.

09:58.928 --> 10:00.695
No. Hat hair, hat hair.
Please don't.

10:00.729 --> 10:03.263
Yes, she's pressing
the flesh very well, sir.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.133
And these people
have a lot of flesh.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.667
Two things in politics
to avoid--

10:07.701 --> 10:09.936
Middle East and family strife.
And we're combining both?

10:09.970 --> 10:12.338
<i>Now you get the daughter</i>
<i>to apologize.</i>

10:12.372 --> 10:14.006
You have my authority.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.508
Ergo, you have
POTUS's authority.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.243
- <i>Understood?</i>
- Yes, sir.

10:18.277 --> 10:20.478
( sighs )
If this were the '60s,

10:20.513 --> 10:22.881
we could just have the National
Guard shoot the daughter.

10:22.915 --> 10:24.850
West Wing, West Wing.
Pardon me. Coming through.

10:24.884 --> 10:27.452
- Oh, hi there.
- Pardon me, West Wing. Pardon me. Excuse me.

10:27.487 --> 10:29.822
Oh, hello, little girl.
Office of the president.

10:29.856 --> 10:32.124
Please step off to the side.
Thank you.

10:32.159 --> 10:35.394
Ma'am, I have been charged
with informing you

10:35.429 --> 10:37.697
that you need to get
your daughter Catherine

10:37.731 --> 10:41.234
to apologize unequivocally
and immediately.

10:41.268 --> 10:44.504
Yeah? Well, go shit
yourself, Long Tall Sally,

10:44.538 --> 10:46.606
because I will deal
with my daughter

10:46.640 --> 10:49.575
in my own way on my own terms.

10:49.610 --> 10:51.044
Yes, ma'am.

10:51.078 --> 10:53.379
- Oh, here's your ma.
- Selina: <i>Hey, you got her?</i>

10:53.413 --> 10:55.648
Hi, Catherine.
How are you?

10:55.682 --> 10:58.817
- Hi, Mom.
- Stop it. Stop it. You're freaking me out.

10:58.851 --> 11:00.652
- Stop it.
- Freaking you out?

11:00.719 --> 11:02.353
No, honey.
Not you, Catherine.

11:02.388 --> 11:05.256
It was Mike. He had you
on top of his body.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.491
No, that came out wrong.

11:07.525 --> 11:09.360
- Listen, how are you doing?
- I'm okay.

11:09.394 --> 11:11.262
I'm getting a lot of attention.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.397
- Yeah.
- Why are you wearing a cowboy hat?

11:13.432 --> 11:15.266
I'm at a pork event.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.435
Listen, you can't talk
to anybody about this essay.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.304
No media, no journalists
or anything.

11:20.338 --> 11:22.172
You have somebody there, sweetie?
Who is that?

11:22.239 --> 11:23.907
( kissing sounds )

11:23.941 --> 11:26.376
Yeah, actually,
it's my boyfriend.

11:26.410 --> 11:29.013
You're kidding.
That's exciting.

11:29.047 --> 11:31.415
His name is Rahim.
He's Dilka's brother.

11:31.449 --> 11:33.283
Dilka's brother?

11:33.318 --> 11:35.485
What? Do you have a problem
with him being Iranian?

11:35.553 --> 11:37.254
Okay, Catherine, you know

11:37.288 --> 11:39.890
that I am not a racist, okay?

11:39.924 --> 11:42.393
My boyfriend in college
was a quarter Cherokee.

11:42.427 --> 11:45.563
Mom, I'm sorry, but I'm
not gonna say sorry.

11:45.597 --> 11:47.564
- <i>Okay?</i>
- No, Cath--

11:47.599 --> 11:49.099
Catherine, don't--
all right.

11:49.134 --> 11:51.535
- Well, that worked perfectly.
- Good talk with Catherine?

11:51.569 --> 11:54.138
Well, we've had
happier conversations.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.906
Like when I told her
her grandpa had died.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.374
Oh, she didn't like him, huh?

11:57.409 --> 11:59.109
No, that's not what I meant.

11:59.143 --> 12:01.545
Oh, sorry. It's just my
grampy, he was a real prick.

12:01.579 --> 12:03.280
- Okay, Mike.
- I mean he was--

12:03.314 --> 12:04.815
You need to get a chopper.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.216
I want you to go
to Catherine's college.

12:06.250 --> 12:09.186
No. You pick her up, bring her
to the air base. All right?

12:09.220 --> 12:11.288
Get some towels. I may need
to daughter board her.

12:11.322 --> 12:13.423
Okay?

12:13.458 --> 12:16.326
- You hate choppers, Mike.
- I know.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.595
I'm always afraid I'm gonna
get my head cut off.

12:18.630 --> 12:20.397
Yeah, it happens.

12:26.305 --> 12:29.207
While Israel's military
non-occupation--

12:29.241 --> 12:30.675
No, no, presence.

12:30.710 --> 12:32.944
While Israel's military
presence-- words, words, words.

12:32.978 --> 12:35.914
Furlong: Oh, this whole being
pleasant is fucking exhausting.

12:35.948 --> 12:37.382
Yes, sir.
It's very tiring.

12:37.416 --> 12:39.517
I'm running out of nice juice to
spray at these shit munchers.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.985
Hi there.
Good to see you.

12:41.019 --> 12:44.055
We also desire a settled homeland
for the Palestinian people.

12:44.090 --> 12:46.291
Furlong:
<i>Oh, look who we have here.</i>

12:46.358 --> 12:48.960
Not only Ginger Rogers,
but also Ginger Rogers.

12:48.994 --> 12:50.528
Nice joke construction, sir.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.331
Stop trying to polish my dick,
you fucking four-eyed failure.

12:53.365 --> 12:55.066
- Okay.
- And--

12:55.101 --> 12:58.103
Greetings, friends. We were just
in the building, so we stopped by.

12:58.137 --> 13:00.873
In the building? Okay. What, are you
guys washing the windows today?

13:00.907 --> 13:02.942
- Working on the bathrooms?
- You're quite the wit, Dan.

13:02.976 --> 13:04.543
Yeah, I am quite the wit.
And you're quite--

13:04.578 --> 13:05.945
<i>We were just heading</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

13:05.979 --> 13:09.248
My father's breathing
has become very bad.

13:09.282 --> 13:11.517
They think he might not
last through the night.

13:11.551 --> 13:15.487
And Dan needs to come with me so
we can continue the statement.

13:15.522 --> 13:17.723
- Apologies.
- Oh, no, not at all. I'm sorry about your dad.

13:17.757 --> 13:19.658
- Okay, we should be going.
- We'll talk another time, then.

13:19.693 --> 13:21.193
I got all the time
in the world.

13:21.228 --> 13:23.462
We do actually have to be
out of DC by tomorrow.

13:23.530 --> 13:26.098
- It's a metaphor.
- I don't think it strictly is, sir.

13:26.133 --> 13:27.666
As a figure of speech--

13:27.701 --> 13:29.869
You know, you're about as annoying
as a condom filled with fire ants.

13:29.903 --> 13:31.437
How's that for
a fucking metaphor?

13:31.471 --> 13:33.205
- That's a simile, sir.
- Shut your mouth, you fat girl.

13:33.239 --> 13:36.108
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

13:36.142 --> 13:38.944
So what hospital
is your dad in?

13:38.979 --> 13:40.679
George Washington.

13:40.714 --> 13:42.481
Oh, that's a good one.

13:45.151 --> 13:47.352
They got a big Starbucks there.

13:47.387 --> 13:49.354
It's nice. You know, people
go in there that aren't--

13:49.388 --> 13:51.589
- You don't have to speak.
- Thank you.

13:51.624 --> 13:54.158
There you go, ma'am.
You taste that.

13:54.193 --> 13:55.873
- That's heaven right there.
- This is big.

13:55.894 --> 13:57.127
But I bet I can finish it.

13:57.162 --> 13:59.363
Kent: <i>I want to smash
the I-4 corridor--</i>

13:59.431 --> 14:02.866
and I mean smash it-- all the while
focusing on the inside game.

14:02.901 --> 14:05.969
Then what-- holy cow.

14:06.004 --> 14:08.038
<i>A pig.</i>

14:08.072 --> 14:10.941
Mike: <i>It's not being
in the helicopter.</i>

14:10.975 --> 14:13.110
<i>That's fine. I can
ride in a helicopter.</i>

14:13.145 --> 14:16.047
It's just getting in.
I'm afraid it's gonna wobble.

14:16.081 --> 14:17.982
Like, you know, it'd chop
the top of my head off

14:18.017 --> 14:19.717
like a soft-boiled egg
and then I'm, like,

14:19.752 --> 14:21.653
running around trying
to put my head back on.

14:21.687 --> 14:24.922
This is crazy, Mike. All I did
was write a review of a movie.

14:24.990 --> 14:29.093
I know, Catherine, but the whole
Middle East thing is very confusing.

14:29.127 --> 14:30.662
Right, Rahim?

14:30.696 --> 14:32.864
No, sometimes it can seem
pretty clear-cut to me.

14:32.898 --> 14:36.468
- Yeah, well-- excuse me.
- ( cell phone chiming )

14:36.502 --> 14:38.303
Mike, where are you?

14:38.338 --> 14:40.705
I'm at the hog roast.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.874
And are you paralyzed
from the neck down?

14:42.909 --> 14:46.077
- Why aren't you stopping this?
- Stopping...

14:46.145 --> 14:48.580
Has the position of this
administration changed

14:48.648 --> 14:50.950
toward Israel and Palestine?

14:50.984 --> 14:54.587
We support the state
of Israel, of course...

14:54.622 --> 14:57.390
Mike, the VP
is voicing solidarity

14:57.424 --> 15:00.994
with the Jewish people
in front of rotating pork.

15:01.029 --> 15:04.064
- ...for the Jewish people.
- Change the visual.

15:04.099 --> 15:06.400
- Deport the visual.
- Yes, sir.

15:06.435 --> 15:08.669
- ( cell phone rings )
- J-1-1.

15:08.737 --> 15:10.504
What's your Jonah emergency?

15:10.538 --> 15:12.706
Jonah, move the veep
away from the pig.

15:12.741 --> 15:14.742
<i>Think about</i>
<i>the sensitivities here.</i>

15:14.776 --> 15:18.346
What, pork? Mike, most Jews in
this country are fine with pork.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.814
Pork schmork, they often say.

15:19.848 --> 15:22.083
Most Jews in this country

15:22.117 --> 15:24.719
are fine with pork, Mr. Davison.
Pork schmork, really.

15:24.753 --> 15:26.387
You ever hear of
the Old Testament, Mike?

15:26.421 --> 15:27.989
Israel, Europe.

15:28.023 --> 15:29.524
Jonah, Israel, Europe.

15:29.558 --> 15:31.759
Okay. Fuck.
Fine, Mike.

15:31.793 --> 15:34.262
But you fucking owe me for this.
Excuse me.

15:36.231 --> 15:38.466
Amy: These pork folks won't ask Selina
about Middle East politics, right?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.502
Oh, no. Those fuckers
probably think

15:40.569 --> 15:42.503
the Middle East means Kansas.

15:42.538 --> 15:45.673
Hey, you know what? I'm not
really great with illness

15:45.707 --> 15:48.643
or death or basic empathy,

15:48.677 --> 15:50.344
but I just want to say
I'm sorry about your dad

15:50.378 --> 15:52.079
and I think you're
being really brave.

15:52.113 --> 15:53.580
What?
Why are we stopping here?

15:53.614 --> 15:55.182
That's my dad.

15:55.216 --> 15:57.350
Jesus, he doesn't look
like he's dying.

15:57.385 --> 15:59.552
My family was guilt-tripping
the shit out of me

15:59.586 --> 16:01.454
and so I exaggerated
to come visit.

16:01.488 --> 16:03.989
Besides, a dying dad can be
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

16:04.024 --> 16:06.025
- Like with Furlong.
- Wow.

16:06.059 --> 16:08.194
That is cold.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.262
Also kind of hot.

16:10.297 --> 16:13.966
...and as a homeland
for the Jewish people

16:14.000 --> 16:15.935
while at the same time
we support

16:15.969 --> 16:18.037
a settled homeland
for the Palestinians.

16:18.104 --> 16:19.638
I can still see the pig's ass.

16:19.673 --> 16:21.473
You're not blocking it.
Bend down.

16:21.508 --> 16:23.008
Tie your shoe, whatever.

16:23.043 --> 16:25.978
That's a circle
that's tricky to square.

16:26.013 --> 16:27.847
And the president and I...

16:27.881 --> 16:31.050
We really need a bulkier man
in this situation.

16:31.084 --> 16:34.187
- Am I there?
- Mike: <i>Get closer towards it.</i>

16:34.221 --> 16:36.322
Okay, Mike, it's right
next to the coals.

16:36.356 --> 16:37.490
The coals are hot.

16:37.524 --> 16:39.926
Hey, quit touching the pig.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.294
It's not a fucking petting zoo.

16:41.328 --> 16:43.496
Ma'am, this is a matter
of security, okay?

16:43.530 --> 16:45.431
You think this pig
is gonna attack her?

16:45.465 --> 16:47.900
Son, that fucker
is skinned and roasted.

16:47.934 --> 16:49.301
He's at a huge disadvantage.

16:49.336 --> 16:52.138
Okay, look, office of the president.
So I'm staying.

16:52.205 --> 16:54.406
I don't care if there is a funeral
procession due to use that street.

16:54.441 --> 16:56.876
<i>It is to be closed</i>
<i>by 4:00 today.</i>

16:56.910 --> 16:59.745
It'll cheer the family up, sir.
Everyone loves a motorcade.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.514
Hello.
What do you want?

17:01.548 --> 17:03.082
You can't have it.
Good-bye.

17:03.116 --> 17:04.916
The congressman
would like to have

17:04.952 --> 17:07.854
a very polite chat in the next few
days with the vice president.

17:07.887 --> 17:08.921
No, he cannot.

17:08.955 --> 17:10.789
I need you to let the veep know

17:10.824 --> 17:13.459
that I just wanted to apologize
for any erratic behavior

17:13.492 --> 17:16.162
she might have witnessed
from me in the past.

17:16.195 --> 17:18.329
Does erratic behavior include
you storming into this office

17:18.365 --> 17:20.398
and violently yelling
at everyone?

17:20.434 --> 17:22.535
Yes.
I wasn't myself.

17:22.569 --> 17:24.569
I was having a bit
of a rough go.

17:24.604 --> 17:27.773
My wife-- and I'm not looking
for sympathy for this--

17:27.808 --> 17:30.877
but she was very ill
with kidney disease.

17:30.911 --> 17:33.213
Your wife is perfectly fine.
She ran the Seattle Marathon.

17:33.247 --> 17:34.648
All right, don't fuck
with me, honey.

17:34.682 --> 17:37.284
Just put my fucking name
in your stupid fucking schedule

17:37.318 --> 17:39.252
and get me a face-to-face
with the veep now!

17:39.287 --> 17:41.921
Excuse me. You need to leave
this office now, sir.

17:41.989 --> 17:43.390
- We do need to leave.
- Oh, really?

17:43.424 --> 17:46.059
Okay, I've got boxes
and boxes on Selina Meyer.

17:46.094 --> 17:47.861
You understand me?

17:47.895 --> 17:49.897
I've got Pandora's
fucking boxes on her.

17:49.931 --> 17:53.167
But we're fighting the lies
from many people in your party

17:53.201 --> 17:55.603
about the environmental
impact of what we do.

17:55.637 --> 17:58.706
You can't raise pigs
without excrement, ma'am.

17:58.741 --> 18:00.241
- Uh-huh.
- It just can't be done.

18:00.275 --> 18:02.644
- I see. Yes.
- They defecate.

18:02.678 --> 18:04.813
And they defecate with speed.

18:04.847 --> 18:06.982
- Oh, Lord. Oh, goodness.
- And volume.

18:07.016 --> 18:08.650
Well, I hear that.
They're pigs.

18:08.718 --> 18:11.753
Why wouldn't they? And I'm interested
to hear a few other folks.

18:11.787 --> 18:15.023
- I thank you for your time. Hello, Miss America?
- Yeah.

18:15.057 --> 18:18.459
I've been scratching my eyebrow for
three and a half fucking hours.

18:18.494 --> 18:20.828
- Where have you been?
- I thought we weren't doing the eyebrow thing.

18:20.862 --> 18:23.942
- You said about the crabs.
- Okay, from now on, we're doing the eyebrow thing.

18:23.965 --> 18:26.033
Okay? And we've got
to get out of here.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.935
Did I tell you my girlfriend
came up with the eyebrow thing?

18:27.969 --> 18:29.836
Oh, well, good for her.
We've got to go, right?

18:36.210 --> 18:38.411
Since the midterms,
it's been really apocalyptic.

18:38.446 --> 18:40.113
- We know you're busy, hon.
- It's fine.

18:40.148 --> 18:43.050
But right now I am focused
on you, Daddy.

18:49.357 --> 18:51.091
Is that Dan Egan?

18:51.126 --> 18:53.160
( sirens blaring )

18:53.194 --> 18:55.896
So you discussed our signals
with your girlfriend?

18:55.930 --> 18:57.397
Yeah, she's really creative.

18:57.432 --> 18:59.533
I thought she could come
up with some good ones.

18:59.567 --> 19:02.202
And is she the only civilian
that you shared them with?

19:02.236 --> 19:04.137
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

19:04.172 --> 19:06.306
Well, no-- oh, no.
Dana would not leak.

19:06.341 --> 19:09.443
- Classic first-stage denial.
- Quiet.

19:09.477 --> 19:12.913
I mean, it must be.
Gary, think about it.

19:12.947 --> 19:15.683
It must be Dana.

19:15.717 --> 19:17.618
Oh, my God.

19:17.653 --> 19:19.754
She's getting her leak on.

19:19.788 --> 19:22.757
What in the living fuck is
that god-awful smell, Jonah?

19:22.825 --> 19:25.560
Oh, my jacket is partially
soaked in pork fat, ma'am.

19:25.594 --> 19:27.161
Oh.

19:28.397 --> 19:31.465
So you two aren't
back together, then?

19:31.499 --> 19:34.001
No, no.
Just colleagues.

19:34.035 --> 19:36.603
- You broke her heart. You know that?
- No.

19:36.637 --> 19:39.172
- Yeah. Yes.
- No. He--

19:39.239 --> 19:42.241
he didn't even graze it.
We went on three dates.

19:42.276 --> 19:44.978
Oh, dang, Amy.
You put out quick.

19:45.012 --> 19:46.713
Amy and I just weren't
compatible.

19:46.747 --> 19:49.917
Right. It turns out I can't mate
with anyone outside of my species.

19:49.951 --> 19:51.785
We all know what you need, Amy.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.120
I mean besides a big, fat slap.

19:53.154 --> 19:55.423
I do not want children, okay?

19:55.457 --> 19:56.791
Why can nobody accept this?

19:56.826 --> 19:58.660
Sweetie, you do not
have to decide right now.

19:58.694 --> 20:00.061
You still have plenty of time.

20:00.096 --> 20:02.965
- I remained fertile till I was 56.
- Terrific.

20:02.999 --> 20:06.201
- Just because I have a vagina...
- For God's sake, Amy.

20:06.236 --> 20:07.903
We just want you
to be happy, sweetie.

20:07.937 --> 20:11.039
I am happy without kids.

20:11.074 --> 20:12.941
- I am-- right?
- Oh, she's deliriously happy.

20:12.976 --> 20:14.643
At work we actually
call her Amiable Amy.

20:14.678 --> 20:17.812
I think I'm gonna go get a coffee.
Anyone else?

20:17.847 --> 20:22.383
- Father: <i>No, thank you.</i>
- I will help you carry that second coffee.

20:23.585 --> 20:26.587
I wrote an essay about
a very important film.

20:26.621 --> 20:27.988
Okay? You should
be proud of me.

20:28.023 --> 20:29.490
It's not
"Debbie Does Damascus."

20:29.525 --> 20:31.392
No, I am proud of you.
But, sweetheart,

20:31.426 --> 20:33.661
if we lose
the pro-Israel vote,

20:33.695 --> 20:35.997
then we lose Florida
in two years

20:36.031 --> 20:37.765
and that's 29 electoral votes.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.267
And then Mommy's out of a job.

20:39.301 --> 20:41.769
Okay, I'm still
not going to apologize.

20:41.803 --> 20:44.338
Have you even seen the movie
that I'm talking about?

20:44.373 --> 20:45.673
When would I have time
to see a film?

20:45.707 --> 20:47.741
I haven't even been able to see

20:47.776 --> 20:50.177
that wonderful movie
with the blue people in it.

20:50.212 --> 20:52.346
- "Avatar."
- "Avatar." Exactly.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.315
So you graduate
in what, a year?

20:54.349 --> 20:56.283
Yeah, hopefully, if I can
get the money together

20:56.318 --> 20:58.152
for the last two semesters.

20:58.186 --> 20:59.687
Ah, money's tight, huh?

20:59.754 --> 21:01.489
You know, my attitude
to money is--

21:01.523 --> 21:04.492
I'll be 22 when I graduate,
I'll owe 60 grand.

21:04.526 --> 21:06.761
And I did the math.
I'll chase my student debt

21:06.795 --> 21:08.596
for the next 27 years
of my life.

21:08.631 --> 21:10.832
Hey, fresh coffee back here
if you guys want some.

21:10.866 --> 21:12.667
Oh, great.
Yeah.

21:12.701 --> 21:14.469
Coffee.

21:16.172 --> 21:18.873
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

21:18.908 --> 21:21.142
I owe 100 grand.

21:22.845 --> 21:26.280
Sweet Jesus Christ.

21:26.314 --> 21:28.248
I want to see the film
and I will see the film.

21:28.316 --> 21:30.050
Gary, we need to get it.
It's "Five Easy Pieces."

21:30.085 --> 21:31.952
It's "5 Broken Cameras."

21:31.986 --> 21:33.720
- Okay, it's "Broken Cameras."
- Mom, don't even bother.

21:33.755 --> 21:36.223
This is gonna be like "Super
Size Me" all over again.

21:36.258 --> 21:38.492
Why don't you guys just
go see "Mamma Mia!" again

21:38.527 --> 21:40.328
for the 10th fucking time?

21:40.362 --> 21:43.564
Do not swear at me, Catherine.
Don't.

21:43.599 --> 21:46.634
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

21:46.669 --> 21:49.237
I understand that you
are feeling attacked, babe.

21:49.305 --> 21:52.140
And that's why I'm here
with you right now.

21:52.174 --> 21:54.676
I'm supposed to be
at a national security meeting,

21:54.710 --> 21:57.979
- but you are my priority, okay?
- Okay.

21:58.013 --> 22:00.615
- You hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I'll apologize.

22:00.649 --> 22:04.218
- Good girl.
- If I can spend Thanksgiving with Rahim and his family.

22:04.253 --> 22:07.489
No, darling.
We've got Grandma coming.

22:07.523 --> 22:09.224
We got to smile at her
and cut her Jell-O.

22:10.393 --> 22:13.228
( cell phone chiming )

22:13.263 --> 22:14.663
Yeah, Sue?

22:14.697 --> 22:16.899
Mike, if she's in the can,
haul her out.

22:16.933 --> 22:18.434
I don't care
if she's trailing paper.

22:18.468 --> 22:20.769
She can make this if she
leaves right this second.

22:20.804 --> 22:22.571
She's currently
with her daughter.

22:22.606 --> 22:25.007
Look, Mike, man up
and prioritize, okay?

22:25.042 --> 22:27.510
I do it every day.
Prioritize, that is.

22:27.545 --> 22:29.279
Okay.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.482
- What about Wednesday?
- Ahem.

22:32.516 --> 22:35.351
Ma'am, you need to make like a
snake and get on that airplane.

22:35.385 --> 22:37.019
Okay, but I'm in the middle

22:37.053 --> 22:39.588
of an important conversation
with my daughter.

22:39.623 --> 22:41.857
- So everything can be put on hold, okay?
- Okay.

22:41.892 --> 22:44.460
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:44.494 --> 22:47.430
So I have to spend Thanksgiving
with you and Memaw.

22:47.464 --> 22:48.797
- Yes.
- Wednesday.

22:48.832 --> 22:50.132
Wednesday you're with your dad.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.834
Thursday you're
with me and Grandma.

22:51.868 --> 22:54.603
Friday you can be with
the new boyfriend, okay?

22:54.638 --> 22:56.505
And Saturday.

22:56.539 --> 22:58.941
If you come home
on Saturday night.

23:00.310 --> 23:02.977
Yeah, I'll check that
over with Rahim.

23:06.649 --> 23:08.549
Okay, let's get going.

23:08.584 --> 23:10.918
- You are a great negotiator.
- I know I am.

23:11.754 --> 23:13.821
Hey.
So Sue called.

23:13.889 --> 23:15.289
Apparently she
bitch-slapped Furlong.

23:15.324 --> 23:16.824
He usually has to pay for that.

23:16.859 --> 23:18.226
And we need that
Catherine apology ASAP.

23:18.260 --> 23:19.928
Okay? I can do it,
you can stay here.

23:19.962 --> 23:21.329
We'll liaise
via e-mail.

23:21.363 --> 23:23.498
Um, yeah.
I really--

23:23.532 --> 23:26.735
Actually, you know what?
I would prefer it

23:26.769 --> 23:28.370
if you were physically there.

23:28.404 --> 23:30.405
It's, you know,
an important statement.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.642
You're right. It needs to happen.
Let's go.

23:34.345 --> 23:37.714
You're welcome.

23:37.748 --> 23:40.250
Amiable Amy? That is the
best you could come up with?

23:40.284 --> 23:43.086
Yeah, you know, I knew I should
have gone with Amy Whitehouse.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.621
It's very nice meeting you...

23:44.655 --> 23:46.289
- It's so nice to meet you, too.
- Madam Vice President.

23:46.323 --> 23:49.358
Sure. What are you
studying at school?

23:49.393 --> 23:50.960
Computer science.
Math minor.

23:50.995 --> 23:52.462
<i>Where are you headed</i>
<i>with all that?</i>

23:52.496 --> 23:54.631
Hopefully, actually,
get into a government branch.

23:54.665 --> 23:57.834
- Defense or FBI, maybe.
- Uh-huh.

23:57.868 --> 23:59.736
- Well, I speak Farsi--
- You speak Farsi?

23:59.770 --> 24:01.871
- Yeah.
- But you were born here?

24:01.906 --> 24:03.807
- Yes, I was born here.
- Uh-huh, great.

24:03.841 --> 24:05.976
<i>And your parents</i>
<i>were born here?</i>

24:06.010 --> 24:07.978
They were actually
born in Iran in Tehran.

24:08.012 --> 24:09.446
Yeah, that's where we're from.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.714
- Oh, I see. Tehran.
- Yeah. Yep.

24:11.749 --> 24:14.584
Ma'am, General Mercer from the
Pentagon is on the phone.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.487
Oh, I don't need to talk
to General Mercer right now.

24:16.521 --> 24:19.823
- He's pretty insistent.
- I don't need a General Mercer call right now.

24:19.858 --> 24:21.658
( whispers )
He's really on the phone.

24:21.692 --> 24:23.793
- Oh, General Mercer's on the phone.
- Mm-hmm.

24:23.828 --> 24:26.930
Can you hang tight
two seconds, Rahim?

24:26.964 --> 24:29.524
- General Mercer.
- <i>I'm sorry to be calling, Madam Vice President,</i>

24:29.533 --> 24:31.000
but we are going
to be discussing

24:31.035 --> 24:33.636
the hostage situation
in around 25 minutes.

24:33.671 --> 24:36.606
Do you think you can get here or
should we go ahead without you?

24:36.641 --> 24:38.842
No, no, no. Don't go
ahead without me.

24:38.876 --> 24:41.811
- We can set up a video link from the plane.
- I'm on it. I got it.

24:41.846 --> 24:44.047
Selina: <i>So that would
work out perfectly.</i>

24:44.082 --> 24:46.584
And I want Rahim to stay.
I've got to-- mm-hmm.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.453
- Rahim, stay. You, too, Catherine.
- Yeah, okay.

24:49.521 --> 24:51.655
- Thank you, Madam Vice President.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

24:51.690 --> 24:54.525
We should actually probably go.

24:54.559 --> 24:56.660
I have to get back
to study for a midterm.

24:56.694 --> 24:58.963
Yeah, yeah. What are
your parents' names?

24:58.997 --> 25:02.966
- That Rahim turns out to be a nice boy.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.003
Let's run a security check
on him and his entire family.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.370
Yes, ma'am.

25:07.405 --> 25:09.773
- And investigate their finances.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:09.807 --> 25:12.543
I was actually reconsidering
my financial situation.

25:12.577 --> 25:14.611
Oh, are you about to ask me
for money, Mike?

25:14.645 --> 25:16.646
- I don't want to.
- No, no, no.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.982
I thought you would and I
want to give you money.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.052
- ( exhales )
- And I have the money, so why not?

25:22.087 --> 25:23.254
Exactly.
And it's not a big--

25:23.288 --> 25:25.990
Giving cash to my director
of communications--

25:26.024 --> 25:28.125
do you think that that
would play well, Mike?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.561
- Yeah.
- No. No, it wouldn't.

25:30.595 --> 25:32.396
No, ma'am.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

25:44.376 --> 25:46.944
I can't videoconference
like this.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.146
I can't get
the dent out at all.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.782
- I look like Bozo.
- Do you want me to fix it?

25:51.817 --> 25:54.118
- Oh, do you have a blow-dryer?
- <i>I don't.</i>

25:54.153 --> 25:57.389
No. Whose idea
was this hat?

25:57.423 --> 25:59.558
- Was that Dana's idea, too?
- Mm-mm.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.793
- Did you talk to her?
- We texted.

26:01.828 --> 26:04.229
- And?
- She--

26:04.264 --> 26:05.531
she may have mentioned
the signals

26:05.565 --> 26:08.267
- to one of her girlfriends.
- ( sighs )

26:08.301 --> 26:10.469
The link to your video
conference is up, ma'am.

26:13.206 --> 26:15.808
Gary...

26:15.842 --> 26:18.811
I do not like to say this,

26:18.845 --> 26:22.582
but you have truly
disappointed me today.

26:24.184 --> 26:27.219
Do you have any idea how
foolish you have made me look?

26:27.254 --> 26:29.355
I do.

26:35.830 --> 26:37.497
I am having the best day.

26:37.532 --> 26:40.433
This is such a great time.

26:40.468 --> 26:43.236
We're on Air Force Two.
U.S. Hey is getting started.

26:43.271 --> 26:45.772
Guys, we saved
the Florida vote.

26:45.807 --> 26:47.741
You guys want to play
iPad Scrabble?

26:47.775 --> 26:50.711
Jonah, please.
Just shut up.

26:50.745 --> 26:53.013
Mike, you want to...

26:53.047 --> 26:55.582
suck some of the pork fat
out of my jacket?

26:55.617 --> 26:57.651
Come on, it's a free meal.

26:59.053 --> 27:01.655
Hey, Lori. Does Kent
Davison still come here?

27:01.689 --> 27:03.056
No, he left.

27:03.091 --> 27:05.859
He said it was too full
of DC people or something.

27:05.893 --> 27:07.994
I see you got a mention
in "Playbook" yesterday.

27:08.029 --> 27:09.996
- Yep.
- Awesome.

27:10.031 --> 27:12.866
I have a Google alert
set up for your name.

27:12.900 --> 27:15.636
- Wow.
- Hey, did you catch Krauthammer

27:15.670 --> 27:17.337
in the "Post" about
the hostage situation?

27:17.371 --> 27:19.172
Are you the guy that always
says hi to me in the garage?

27:19.207 --> 27:20.607
Yeah.

27:20.642 --> 27:22.609
Yeah, I got to do
some fucking weights.

27:22.644 --> 27:24.845
This is for rubber idiots.

27:25.148 --> 27:29.600
