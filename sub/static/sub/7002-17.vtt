00:10.076 --> 00:12.711
When cutting the shelving
for your entertainment center,

00:12.712 --> 00:15.046
You want to remember
the old carpenters' adage,

00:15.047 --> 00:16.848
"measure twice, cut once."

00:16.849 --> 00:19.550
Yeah, but what about
the other adage
by the carpenters?

00:19.551 --> 00:23.989
<i>♪ why do birds</i>
<i>suddenly appear</i>

00:23.990 --> 00:25.724
<i>♪ when you're near...? ♪</i>

00:25.725 --> 00:28.326
If you'd like plans
for our entertainment center,

00:28.327 --> 00:29.928
Write to us, <i>tool time,</i>

00:29.929 --> 00:32.330
And ask for
<i>tool time</i> plan a340.

00:32.331 --> 00:35.634
But a340 won't include
the little adjustment I made.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.869
And what little adjustment
would that be, tim?

00:37.870 --> 00:41.840
I installed a little
swing-out drawer for the vcr.

00:41.841 --> 00:44.843
Well, plan a340
does not require
a pull-out drawer

00:44.844 --> 00:47.045
And will not be
in the blueprints.

00:47.046 --> 00:50.682
<i>Al, al, al.</i>

00:50.683 --> 00:53.818
<i>Let's not get hung up</i>
<i>on blueprints, shall we, al?</i>

00:53.819 --> 00:55.820
<i>Let's think about</i>
<i>the many things in life</i>

00:55.821 --> 00:59.257
<i>That have been built</i>
<i>just on the old noggin</i>
<i>using the imagination.</i>

00:59.258 --> 01:01.660
<i>Like the seven wonders</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

01:01.661 --> 01:04.863
I believe the sphinx
required extensive
blueprints, tim.

01:04.864 --> 01:09.768
<i>Al, al, al.</i>

01:09.769 --> 01:13.504
<i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>the seven wonders</i>
<i>of the manly world.</i>

01:13.505 --> 01:15.674
Wing nuts.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.075
Oh-ho-ho.

01:17.076 --> 01:21.046
The athletic cup.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:21.047 --> 01:23.181
<i>Gatorade.</i>

01:23.182 --> 01:25.616
You're comparing gatorade
to the sphinx?

01:25.617 --> 01:28.887
Has the sphinx ever replaced
your electrolytes?

01:28.888 --> 01:31.122
I don't think so, al.

01:31.123 --> 01:33.825
Tim, can we stop
this nonsense

01:33.826 --> 01:36.761
And please get back
to our project at hand?

01:36.762 --> 01:39.831
As you can see,
I've added a new roller
on the drawer here

01:39.832 --> 01:41.966
Using binford's
new easy-glide system.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.435
It's teflon coated, so it's
just like fluid movements.

01:44.436 --> 01:47.739
Well, I hope you put stops
on the front of the track, tim.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.742
Gosh, I hope I did.
Otherwise, think,
it would fall right out.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.211
<i>(laughing)</i>

01:53.212 --> 01:55.546
It worked. I apologize.

01:55.547 --> 01:58.783
It is fluid-like movement,
'cause you can move your vcr
in and out just like that.

03:15.294 --> 03:18.229
Well, what do you think?
Can we put the kids
in the middle?

03:22.068 --> 03:24.069
Come on, isiah.
Here he goes. There he...

03:24.070 --> 03:26.838
Drives a lane,
he shoots, he scores!

03:26.839 --> 03:28.340
All right!

03:28.341 --> 03:30.342
Dad, what game
are you watching?

03:30.343 --> 03:32.610
I taped
the piston-bulls game
from last night.

03:32.611 --> 03:35.413
Oh, great game.
The pistons...
N-n-no. Quiet!

03:35.414 --> 03:38.049
I don't wanna know the score.
I didn't see it last night.
That's why I taped it.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.517
I didn't look at the paper.

03:39.518 --> 03:42.120
So you don't want us
to ruin the surprise
for you.

03:42.121 --> 03:44.122
Yeah, brainiac.
That's the idea.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.391
Aren't there some ants
you can burn somewhere

03:46.392 --> 03:48.226
Or something like that?

03:48.227 --> 03:50.495
Brad, this has gotta be
worth something.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.031
I mean, at least
a couple of bucks.

03:53.032 --> 03:55.533
It's not worth any bucks.
Nothing. You're getting
no money, ok?

03:55.534 --> 03:58.536
Ok, but, you know,
we wouldn't want the score
to accidentally...

03:58.537 --> 03:59.770
Quiet. Quiet!

03:59.771 --> 04:01.873
Like 98...
All right!

04:01.874 --> 04:04.842
Boy, oh, boy,
you guys.

04:04.843 --> 04:06.378
Here.
Take all I got.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.413
Dad, we meant
two bucks each.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.850
Come on.
Don't mess up my suit.
Go, go, go. Get out.

04:12.851 --> 04:15.686
Tim, will you sign
this card for sheila?

04:15.687 --> 04:18.289
Not now. I'm watching
this piston-bulls game
I taped.

04:18.290 --> 04:20.925
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
The bulls. That's, uh...

04:20.926 --> 04:23.194
Marvin jordan, right?

04:23.195 --> 04:25.796
Yeah, marvin...
<i>Michael</i> jordan.
Michael jordan.

04:25.797 --> 04:28.133
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
Don't get too involved in it.

04:28.134 --> 04:31.403
When karen gets here, we gotta
go to sheila's wedding.
What's the hurry?

04:31.404 --> 04:33.405
The groom probably
won't even show up.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.407
Don't say that,
don't say that!
It's bad luck.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.409
How much worse luck
can the woman have?

04:37.410 --> 04:39.411
She's been jilted at the altar,
like, three times.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.978
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
I know.

04:40.979 --> 04:44.249
I'm in the wedding this time.
I'm going to bring her luck.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.485
You were in our wedding.
It didn't bring us
that much luck.

04:47.486 --> 04:50.855
Very funny!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Come in.

04:50.856 --> 04:51.956
Hi.
Hi.

04:51.957 --> 04:54.459
Thank you so much
for baby-sitting for us.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.161
It's my pleasure.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.862
Hi, karen.
Hey, mark.

04:57.863 --> 04:59.997
Ready for a hot hand
of go fish?

04:59.998 --> 05:02.467
Sure, I'll run
and get the cards.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.468
Hey, tim.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.237
Oh, don't bother
to get up.

05:06.238 --> 05:08.706
Wasn't even thinking about it.

05:08.707 --> 05:11.776
Tim, it is so noisy.
Can you turn it down, please?

05:11.777 --> 05:16.448
Ok, tell me everything.
Is it a big wedding,
he spending a fortune?

05:16.449 --> 05:19.750
Yes, I really -
I can't believe it.
I mean...

05:19.751 --> 05:24.021
Her father keeps...
It's not working, hon.

05:24.022 --> 05:26.691
He's gonna be spending,
like, $4,000

05:26.692 --> 05:27.792
On the flowers alone.

05:27.793 --> 05:30.195
$4,000?
Yeah.

05:30.196 --> 05:31.862
That's right. She's 38.

05:31.863 --> 05:34.765
He'd pay anything
to get her out of the house now.

05:34.766 --> 05:38.103
All right, where's the slam
about me being 36 and single?

05:38.104 --> 05:40.205
That was last year.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.940
Now you're 37
and desperate.

05:44.176 --> 05:45.543
Not true.

05:45.544 --> 05:48.613
Just so happens
I'm dating a very nice attorney.

05:48.614 --> 05:50.648
He took me
to the pistons' game last night.

05:50.649 --> 05:53.050
Oh, that's the game
that tim is watching
right now.

05:53.051 --> 05:56.321
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that great
when the pistons won it
right at the buzzer?

05:59.925 --> 06:03.595
Oh, come on, tim.
You weren't gonna see
the whole game anyway.

06:06.064 --> 06:09.300
What did you do with
that list of instructions
that sheila gave us?

06:09.301 --> 06:11.969
I tossed 'em out.
Oh, no! Why?

06:11.970 --> 06:14.805
We have been to north adams
a hundred times.
I need those.

06:14.806 --> 06:17.642
They're very specific
to get to that church.
Here they are.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.877
I know the church. She's almost
been married there three times.

06:19.878 --> 06:23.114
You just follow the teardrops
right up to the door.

06:23.115 --> 06:26.151
I can't take any chances.
I have to be there
a couple of hours early.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.053
I think you're forgetting
who has the radarlike sense
of direction around here.

06:29.054 --> 06:30.221
Tim?
Yeah?

06:30.222 --> 06:32.357
Car is out front.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.795
Well, the radar
doesn't really kick in
till you get in the car.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.282
Tim, I don't think we're
on the right road.

06:57.283 --> 07:00.285
We're fine. We followed
all the signs for the detour.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.287
Sheila said
that after 45 minutes

07:02.288 --> 07:05.122
We should pass a 20-foot guy
holding a huge doughnut.

07:06.358 --> 07:08.125
Well, we missed him.

07:08.126 --> 07:11.128
Maybe he's out looking
for a 40-foot cup of coffee
to dunk it in.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.567
Tim, what road are we on?

07:15.568 --> 07:18.969
127, heading south.
127.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.971
Sheila said that
we would see a place

07:20.972 --> 07:23.774
Called rhonda's
discount hair outlet.

07:23.775 --> 07:26.277
Does sheila know the roads
actually have numbers?

07:26.278 --> 07:27.978
94, 127?

07:27.979 --> 07:30.582
There's no interstate big guy
with a doughnut.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.916
Honey, we're fine.

07:31.917 --> 07:35.186
We took 94 west,
just past ann arbor,
south on 127,

07:35.187 --> 07:38.823
Looking for county line road,
right into north adams.

07:38.824 --> 07:41.593
Tim, that sign.
It just said 223.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.494
It can't be.
I haven't turned off 127.

07:43.495 --> 07:45.430
Well, maybe we should stop
and ask for directions.

07:45.431 --> 07:48.966
Honey, I know
where we're going.
I know where we are.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.168
There's a sign.
Adrian, 6 miles.

07:51.169 --> 07:52.704
Ok, adrian.

07:52.705 --> 07:55.273
Adrian is on 223.
We're down and right.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.275
We're supposed to be
up and left.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.410
Thank you, rand mcnally.
Do you mean north and west?

07:59.411 --> 08:01.912
We have gone
way out of the way. Way out.

08:01.913 --> 08:04.115
No, we haven't.
We're only an inch or so.

08:04.116 --> 08:07.151
I see.
So when we hit ecuador,

08:07.152 --> 08:10.288
You'll just say we're off
by about a foot and a half?

08:10.289 --> 08:12.490
Honey, we're fine.
Ask for directions.

08:12.491 --> 08:15.627
By the time I stop and ask
for directions, we're gonna
be where we're going.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.629
Not if you drive around
in circles.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.130
Watch the map, please.
What?

08:19.131 --> 08:21.165
You're folding it wrong.
Folding it wrong?

08:21.166 --> 08:23.834
Who died and made you
the map police?
Honey!

08:23.835 --> 08:26.638
<i>(car horn)</i>

08:33.645 --> 08:36.113
Tim, my feet are freezing.
I'm starving.

08:36.114 --> 08:38.515
Eat your feet.

08:38.517 --> 08:41.452
Fine. But I'm not
giving you any.

08:41.453 --> 08:42.820
Oh, come on.

08:42.821 --> 08:44.822
I got some life savers.
That'll hold you over.

08:44.823 --> 08:48.893
Thank you. Why can't we
just stop and ask
for directions?

08:48.894 --> 08:50.961
Because we're almost there.

08:50.962 --> 08:52.963
Tim, I have to be there
early enough

08:52.964 --> 08:54.965
To be able
to put my dress on.

08:54.966 --> 08:58.503
We're close.
Next sign you see
will be north adams.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.772
Right there.
What's that say?

09:02.374 --> 09:05.042
"welcome to ohio."

09:13.218 --> 09:16.321
Well, we won't be needing
that michigan map now,
will we?

09:16.322 --> 09:20.692
If we hit kentucky,
I'm filing for divorce.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.093
All right, all right.
I'll pull it over.

09:23.094 --> 09:27.565
You know, seeing that sign
was a good thing,

09:27.566 --> 09:30.468
'cause now we know

09:30.469 --> 09:33.037
That we are finally
in the right direction.

09:33.038 --> 09:35.673
Oh, good. Pull up to
that minimart over there.

09:35.674 --> 09:38.976
You can find out
how to get to north adams.
I don't need directions now.

09:38.977 --> 09:41.979
Stop and ask for directions,
or I will get up early
every morning

09:41.980 --> 09:44.682
And burn
your sports section.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.899
Whoo, boy!

10:01.900 --> 10:04.068
Cold out there.

10:04.069 --> 10:06.704
Officer.
Hi, there.
What can I do for you?

10:06.705 --> 10:09.674
I'm on my way to a wedding.
I gotta find 127.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.709
127? That's pretty far.
Yeah.

10:11.710 --> 10:14.078
You're really lost.

10:14.079 --> 10:15.747
Way lost.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.322
Well, I was letting my wife
do the navigating.

10:25.323 --> 10:27.558
You know how that is.

10:27.559 --> 10:30.595
Ok. You're on county road 6.

10:30.596 --> 10:33.998
You wanna follow that north
2/10 of a mile to 20.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.000
20. Is north right
or left?
It's left.

10:36.001 --> 10:37.368
Thanks a lot, you guys.
All right.

10:37.369 --> 10:40.471
No, you can't go
that way.
Sure he can, marty.

10:40.472 --> 10:44.074
Nah, radio says county road 6
closed near 20, john.

10:44.075 --> 10:45.142
Fallen tree.

10:45.143 --> 10:47.177
Oh, yeah.

10:47.178 --> 10:50.247
You can take county road 6,
turn west on elmwood.

10:50.248 --> 10:53.183
Which is right before oakwood,
so you hit oakwood,
you've gone too far.

10:53.184 --> 10:55.986
Ok. What's before elmwood?

10:55.987 --> 10:58.923
Edgewood, but what do you care?
You're going to elmwood.

11:01.493 --> 11:03.327
Thanks, guys.

11:03.328 --> 11:06.397
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What am I talking about?

11:06.398 --> 11:08.966
Elmwood's closed.
Fallen tree?

11:08.967 --> 11:12.603
No. A dead cow.

11:12.604 --> 11:15.372
Yeah, frozen to the highway.

11:15.373 --> 11:18.810
What?
Happens a lot.

11:18.811 --> 11:20.912
Go north. That's left.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.580
All right.
Ok?

11:22.581 --> 11:24.949
Now, at beechwood
you turn east. That's right.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.784
Now, beechwood
becomes route 2,

11:26.785 --> 11:29.086
But you won't know that,
'cause it's called evelyn.

11:29.087 --> 11:32.156
But it doesn't matter,
'cause the sign blew down.
Sign's down.

11:32.157 --> 11:34.592
Ok. Now, continue
going east on evelyn,

11:34.593 --> 11:36.928
Also known as beechwood,
a.K.A. Route 2,

11:36.929 --> 11:38.395
Till the fork in the road.

11:38.396 --> 11:41.699
Now, north/left is carmelita,
right/south is maple.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.702
You want right/south maple.
Got that?

11:44.703 --> 11:47.237
Cows freeze to the highway
a lot?

11:55.881 --> 11:59.183
This is insane.

11:59.184 --> 12:03.387
Getting dressed
in the backseat of a car.

12:03.388 --> 12:05.322
I cannot believe it.

12:05.323 --> 12:07.992
You look terrific.
Look...

12:07.993 --> 12:11.496
Why are we not there yet?

12:11.497 --> 12:14.499
I mean, didn't we get
those directions,
like, an hour ago?

12:14.500 --> 12:18.903
No, no. It wasn't that long,
and we're almost there, honey.
We're close.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.874
Boy, it's been a long time
since you've been undressed
in the back of this car.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.976
Please just keep driving.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.512
You know, sometimes I forget
just how sexy you are.

12:27.513 --> 12:28.846
Well, keep forgetting.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.717
<i>(car horn)</i>

12:32.718 --> 12:37.054
Will you keep your eyes
on the road?!
I can't.

12:37.055 --> 12:39.624
This storm is getting worse.
I can barely see anything.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.626
Oh, look.
There's some lights up there.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.161
Just pull up into that place
and find out where we are.

12:44.162 --> 12:47.131
We're in north adams.
I can feel it.

12:47.132 --> 12:50.267
Oh, just pull in and see.

12:50.268 --> 12:51.536
Stay here.

12:58.076 --> 13:00.110
Oh, boy.

13:00.111 --> 13:01.746
Killer night.

13:01.747 --> 13:02.947
Oh, no.

13:07.352 --> 13:09.587
Hey! How's it going?

13:09.588 --> 13:12.790
I'm in hell.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.224
How was the wedding?

13:14.225 --> 13:16.627
Terrific.
Oh, what a great time.

13:16.628 --> 13:18.596
Now, if I gotta head back
to that wedding,

13:18.597 --> 13:20.831
What would be the best way
to get back there now?

13:20.832 --> 13:22.099
Why would you wanna go back?

13:22.100 --> 13:24.501
My wife
left her purse there.

13:24.502 --> 13:26.503
Just like a woman, huh?

13:26.504 --> 13:27.939
You're lost again, huh?

13:29.608 --> 13:32.443
Tim, do you know
where we are now?

13:32.444 --> 13:35.980
Yeah, I know exactly
where we are.
Oh, that's good. Hi.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.383
I think I'd better call
the church and tell 'em
that we're gonna be late.

13:47.392 --> 13:51.161
So, this must be
your lovely wife, huh?

13:51.162 --> 13:54.298
Ye...

13:54.299 --> 13:57.001
Jill?

13:57.002 --> 13:59.070
Do you feel a draft
at all?

14:03.241 --> 14:06.176
Area code 419?

14:06.177 --> 14:08.212
Are we still in ohio?

14:08.213 --> 14:11.916
Yes, ma'am.
The buckeye state.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.952
Didn't you tell me
that we were in north adams?

14:14.953 --> 14:17.454
I said I know exactly
where north adams is.

14:17.455 --> 14:20.190
Sure does. We gave him
directions over an hour ago.

14:20.191 --> 14:21.859
You gave him directions?
Oh, no.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.694
Is this the place
that we stopped before?

14:23.695 --> 14:25.796
Sure. We haven't moved.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.001
How did you do this?

14:30.002 --> 14:32.003
Well, I was a little confused
with the blizzard.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.005
You were naked
in the backseat.

14:34.006 --> 14:38.109
Oh, hey, hey. Come on, now.
This is ohio. We have laws.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.111
I think you're just happy
about this.

14:40.112 --> 14:43.413
Oh, yeah. Thrilled.
Look at me. Ha-ha-ha.

14:43.414 --> 14:46.416
This is how I planned it, man.
Drive around three hours.
Blizzard. Get lost.

14:46.417 --> 14:49.386
End up in marty's minimart
here in ohio.

14:54.292 --> 14:57.928
You folks own that
red station wagon out there?
Yes, we do.

14:57.929 --> 14:59.764
It's rolling backwards
down elmwood.

14:59.765 --> 15:02.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

15:04.369 --> 15:06.436
Does anybody
have any...

15:06.437 --> 15:07.938
Karen.
What?

15:07.939 --> 15:11.075
Don't cheat.
Cheating?
I wasn't cheating.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.944
I was just checking to see
if mark needed some more
hot chocolate.

15:13.945 --> 15:15.880
I'll get some.
Ok.

15:15.881 --> 15:20.417
Does anybody have
any... Fours?

15:20.418 --> 15:23.487
Darn it!
You guys always win.

15:25.724 --> 15:29.093
Hi, everybody.
Whoa, dad.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.562
Who are you -
frosty the mudman?

15:31.563 --> 15:33.898
I really don't need
to hear this now, ok?

15:33.899 --> 15:36.067
You obviously got the car
dug out of the ditch.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.069
We got the car
out of the ditch.

15:38.070 --> 15:41.205
Mom must have been mad
when you got lost
in ohio.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.507
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

15:43.508 --> 15:45.609
No, she loved it.
It was the best night
of her life.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.845
<i>(brad and randy)</i>
yeah, right.

15:47.846 --> 15:51.182
I guess that's why
you didn't come home
with your wife.

15:53.085 --> 15:56.020
Over the edge?
Way over the edge.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.224
Uncle bill
took her to the wedding.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.826
He's gonna drop her off
a little later.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.327
Why didn't you go?

16:03.328 --> 16:05.062
Go like this?

16:05.063 --> 16:07.331
Mudman?

16:07.332 --> 16:10.901
I think it's time
you guys went to bed.
And wash up before you go.

16:10.902 --> 16:12.837
Look who's talking.
I heard that.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.806
Thanks for watching
these guys.

16:15.807 --> 16:18.342
How were they?
Oh, they were great.

16:18.343 --> 16:20.177
Did somebody get
the red wings game

16:20.178 --> 16:22.847
On videotape
like I wanted?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.015
It was a great game.
The red wings won 3 to 2 -

16:29.955 --> 16:32.422
Guess you didn't
wanna hear that, did you?

16:32.423 --> 16:33.357
Night.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.429
Hi-ho, tim.

16:39.430 --> 16:41.465
Hi, wilson. You're up late.
What are you doing?

16:41.466 --> 16:45.102
I'm just packing some snow
to send to my cousin ernie
in pango pango.

16:45.103 --> 16:47.238
He really misses the winter.

16:47.239 --> 16:50.207
He does?
Of course,
he pays me for it.

16:50.208 --> 16:53.477
And let me tell you,
there's no business
like snow business.

16:53.478 --> 16:54.979
<i>(laughs)</i>

16:54.980 --> 16:57.181
Oh, I'm on a roll.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.987
You won't believe
the night I've had.

17:02.988 --> 17:06.490
Well, from the looks of you,
I would say that you pushed
a car out of a ditch,

17:06.491 --> 17:08.525
And from the nature
and texture of your clothes,

17:08.526 --> 17:12.262
I would say you were
somewhere in... Ohio?

17:12.263 --> 17:13.864
From the sound of that,

17:13.865 --> 17:16.233
I'd say you were
talking to karen.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.769
I can't fool you,
neighbor tim.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.771
Did you hear the whole story?

17:20.771 --> 17:22.873
Spent half the night
driving around in circles.

17:22.874 --> 17:26.042
Mm-hmm. Through a couple
of states, I believe.

17:26.044 --> 17:28.779
All jill wanted me to do
was stop and ask directions.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.515
I didn't do it because I hate
asking for directions.

17:31.516 --> 17:34.118
Well, all men do.
It makes them feel subservient.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.720
I really was sure
that I knew where I was going.

17:36.721 --> 17:38.222
I sensed it, you know?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.224
That's because men navigate
by instincts

17:40.225 --> 17:42.193
And women navigate
by landmarks.

17:42.194 --> 17:45.930
Yeah, she kept talking about
some huge man with a doughnut.

17:45.931 --> 17:50.067
Oh, sure. That's the sign
for bill's big bun bonanza.

17:50.068 --> 17:55.206
It's the turnoff
to north adams.
<i>(grunts)</i>

17:55.207 --> 17:57.708
Huh. I should have
just done what she said.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.344
Got directions and forget
my stupid instincts.

18:00.345 --> 18:03.948
Oh, tim, don't sell
your stupid instincts short.

18:03.949 --> 18:06.917
Do you realize that people
have a tiny compass
in their nose?

18:06.918 --> 18:09.887
I was never aware
of that, no.

18:09.888 --> 18:11.588
Yes, it's true.

18:11.589 --> 18:14.291
People have
a tiny iron deposit
in their nose.

18:14.292 --> 18:17.494
It's... <i>(nasally)</i> right up here
near the ethmoid bone.

18:17.495 --> 18:19.763
<i>(normal voice)</i>
and that gives them directions
to magnetic north,

18:19.764 --> 18:22.399
And since men have more iron
in their bodies than women,

18:22.400 --> 18:25.669
It only follows
that they would make
a better compass.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.671
<i>(nasally)</i>
if I have such good instincts,

18:27.672 --> 18:30.174
How come I couldn't
find the wedding?
Pardon me, tim?

18:30.175 --> 18:32.176
If I have
such good instincts...

18:32.177 --> 18:34.178
...How come I couldn't
find the wedding?

18:34.179 --> 18:36.480
A map is a little more accurate
than your nose.

18:36.481 --> 18:39.583
Plus it's a heck of a lot
easier to fold.

18:40.785 --> 18:43.287
Oh, here comes
your beautiful bride, tim.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.222
Good night, wilson.

18:47.058 --> 18:48.225
Hi.

18:48.226 --> 18:49.526
Hi.

18:49.527 --> 18:50.928
How'd the wedding go?

18:50.929 --> 18:55.232
There wasn't one.
She got stood up again.

18:56.701 --> 18:57.868
Not again?

18:57.869 --> 18:59.370
I couldn't believe it.

18:59.371 --> 19:02.973
The guy called the caterer
and canceled the dinner.

19:02.974 --> 19:05.976
The caterer broke it to sheila
in kind of a mean way, too.

19:05.977 --> 19:07.978
Walked over
to the wedding cake

19:07.979 --> 19:10.247
And just ripped the groom
right off the top.

19:17.088 --> 19:20.224
Just left a shin
and a knee bone there, huh?

19:20.225 --> 19:22.726
Sheila told everybody
to go home.

19:22.727 --> 19:25.796
You should have seen
aunt merle trying to stuff
all the jumbo shrimp

19:25.797 --> 19:27.798
In her purse before she left.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.800
This was too big
to fit in the purse?

19:29.801 --> 19:31.635
She got
the bottom three layers.

19:31.636 --> 19:35.005
When I left, sheila was crying
into her double bourbon,

19:35.006 --> 19:38.675
Having to listen to that nephew
of hers - you know, todd -

19:38.676 --> 19:41.412
Play "you light up my life"
on the accordion.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.915
Some night, huh? You know
my direction's usually
better than that.

19:44.916 --> 19:49.453
I just got all disoriented,
even though my nose is filled
with iron boogers.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.860
What?
Don't worry.
You got 'em too.

19:56.861 --> 20:00.730
No. Don't explain,
don't explain.

20:00.731 --> 20:03.533
I've already decided
that this whole night
is poor sheila's fault.

20:03.534 --> 20:05.135
I mean, the woman is cursed.

20:05.136 --> 20:07.137
Did you get anything
to eat?
Mnh-mnh.

20:07.138 --> 20:08.638
You want some cake?
Sure.

20:08.639 --> 20:10.941
Would you get some forks
and knives?

20:15.213 --> 20:18.082
Let's see.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.417
You know what this
reminds me of?

20:20.418 --> 20:22.987
Yes.
Our wedding.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.223
Our wedding
was so beautiful.

20:26.224 --> 20:28.993
I am so glad
that I didn't let anybody

20:28.994 --> 20:31.895
Talk me out of marrying you.

20:34.899 --> 20:37.401
Who tried to talk you
out of marrying me?

20:37.402 --> 20:40.070
Oh, no one.
You know, just...

20:40.071 --> 20:43.773
My mom, my dad,
my sisters, my friends.

20:43.774 --> 20:46.377
The minister.

20:46.378 --> 20:50.314
The postman.
Some guy down at the mailbox.

20:50.315 --> 20:53.217
You know. Oh, and sheila...
Yeah.

20:53.218 --> 20:54.718
...Who said to me,

20:54.719 --> 20:58.288
"don't marry him.
I know a loser when I see one."

20:59.624 --> 21:01.625
Well, good thing
she was wrong.

21:01.626 --> 21:03.593
Who said she was wrong?

21:13.405 --> 21:16.907
This is the best cake
sheila's ever had.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.544
I'm never getting married.

21:20.545 --> 21:24.281
You and sheila
have a lot in common.

21:24.282 --> 21:27.151
Dad, what was
your wedding like?

21:27.152 --> 21:28.919
Your mom really loved it.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.721
But I gotta be honest.
Weddings aren't really for men.

21:31.722 --> 21:33.690
What do you mean?

21:33.691 --> 21:36.693
I mean women,
they invent weddings
for other women.

21:36.694 --> 21:39.196
Flower girls tossing
little petals around.

21:39.197 --> 21:41.698
All the bridesmaids look
like big swollen daffodils

21:41.699 --> 21:45.069
In these little taffeta gowns.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.771
Well, then why
get married?

21:47.772 --> 21:51.875
Well, 'cause one day you meet
a real wonderful girl...

21:51.876 --> 21:54.878
Who'll badger you
into thinking it's a great idea.

21:56.714 --> 21:58.982
Is that right?
Hey.

22:00.885 --> 22:03.187
Did you see her
over there?

22:03.188 --> 22:07.023
So, tell me,
mr. Wedding genius expert,

22:07.024 --> 22:09.193
How would you plan
a wedding?

22:09.194 --> 22:11.695
Oh, easy. I'd go
with that football theme.

22:11.696 --> 22:13.263
The old gridiron wedding.

22:13.264 --> 22:15.566
Have the minister
stand up there,
and where he stands,

22:15.567 --> 22:18.068
You put one of those
wide-screen tvs
right behind him

22:18.069 --> 22:20.104
So you can catch
the play-offs.

22:20.105 --> 22:22.672
Then right at the right moment,
the minister would say,

22:22.673 --> 22:26.176
"you may raise the helmet
and kiss the bride."

22:26.177 --> 22:28.979
Then you'd spike the ball
and carry her off.

22:32.783 --> 22:35.252
So I don't hear any complaints
about the honeymoon.

22:35.253 --> 22:37.221
You wouldn't do anything
to change that?

22:37.222 --> 22:39.289
Oh, yeah, yeah.
After the wedding,

22:39.290 --> 22:41.291
You take the bride back
to the honeymoon suite...
Yeah.

22:41.292 --> 22:43.494
...Lower the lights,
turn on some music...
Yeah.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.129
...Play some air hockey.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.397
Well, I like that.
Ok.

22:47.398 --> 22:50.167
So, how many games
would you be up for?

22:50.168 --> 22:52.302
How many quarters you got,
little lady?

22:52.303 --> 22:54.638
I got a whole new roll.

22:54.639 --> 22:57.073
Oh, no.

23:01.746 --> 23:04.348
Why can't we just stop
and ask for directions?

23:04.349 --> 23:06.683
Because we're almost there.

23:06.684 --> 23:08.185
No, it's 6:30.

23:08.186 --> 23:10.887

23:17.395 --> 23:19.463

Yummy.

23:19.464 --> 23:22.566
Yummy.
Yeah. Really good
