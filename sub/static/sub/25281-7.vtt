WEBVTT

00:05.123 --> 00:07.289
Let me ask you a question.
How long do you look

00:07.330 --> 00:10.010
at your cards before
you tell me how many you want?

00:10.052 --> 00:12.138
I mean, I'm-I'm not
trying to be an asshole.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.764
I'm just asking.

00:13.806 --> 00:16.100
- You got someplace to be?
- No, no.

00:16.142 --> 00:18.728
Chief, I'm-I'm here for you.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.941
But, you know, those cards
aren't gonna change.

00:23.983 --> 00:26.944
They're gonna stay the same till
you tell me how many you want.

00:26.986 --> 00:29.321
Just like to think things over,
that's all.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.282
- Good. Good.
- To ruminate.

00:33.284 --> 00:36.203
Okay. You ruminate, chief.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.748
I'm very good.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.750
People make, like,
hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:40.791 --> 00:42.126
from playing this.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.326
You're so st... You're so dumb.

00:46.367 --> 00:47.908
Nah. This is, like, a competitive sport.

00:47.933 --> 00:48.978
Oh, yeah.

00:49.020 --> 00:50.236
Mm-hmm. High IQ.

00:50.261 --> 00:52.136
You ever overhear these
people talk about dying?

00:52.178 --> 00:54.013
Like, they were dead for a minute

00:54.054 --> 00:55.598
or five minutes or whatever.

00:55.639 --> 00:58.726
For every one of them, there's
six others that have a wreck...

00:58.768 --> 01:02.521
motorcycle or whatever...

01:02.563 --> 01:06.192
they're in a coma
for a month or six months.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.985
They wake up, they don't remember shit.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.820
They just remember
they cranked up their bike,

01:09.862 --> 01:12.031
next thing, nothing.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.074
Just some nurse cleaning up their shit,

01:14.116 --> 01:15.409
poking them all over.

01:15.451 --> 01:17.411
"Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith,

01:17.453 --> 01:18.704
"you're in the hospital.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.831
"You had an accident.

01:20.873 --> 01:24.210
Tell me how many fucking fingers
I'm holding up."

01:26.879 --> 01:29.089
- Give me two.
- You got it.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.052
Two for the chief.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.680
One for the dealer.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.766
Let's see. Let's see what you got.

01:38.808 --> 01:40.059
Three cowboys.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.186
Jesus Christ.

01:42.228 --> 01:45.631
You waited that long,
and you're holding three kings?

01:46.482 --> 01:47.716
Fuck.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.944
I got shit.

01:51.946 --> 01:55.699
Anyway, it's obvious the brain
runs the whole operation.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.535
It's got a fucking switch, you know?

01:57.576 --> 01:58.953
Come to papa.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.705
It's off, you're dead.
You don't exist anymore.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.916
Some doctors go in
and fool around a little bit,

02:03.958 --> 02:05.793
you're back.

02:05.835 --> 02:07.419
Mickey! Shut it!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.255
Hey, man, don't you get tired

02:09.295 --> 02:11.389
of hearing yourself talk about stuff

02:11.431 --> 02:13.133
that nobody's interested in?

02:13.175 --> 02:15.553
I'm tired of being
the only smart guy in the room.

02:15.594 --> 02:16.720
- All right?
- Oh, God!

02:16.762 --> 02:18.138
Everywhere I go, nobody wants to listen.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.849
Listen, are you gonna be a baby

02:19.890 --> 02:22.518
if I try to fuck the Chinese chick? Huh?

02:22.560 --> 02:24.854
- Shut up.
- What? Are you? Huh?

02:24.895 --> 02:27.439
Gonna make a difference if I am?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.858
No.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.693
But I want you on board, you know.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.862
I want you supporting me, you know.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.261
- Be nice.
- I don't give a shit.

02:35.303 --> 02:36.782
That's the way it is, with the brain.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.826
Once it's off, you're out. No more.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.100
No more Frankie and Susie,
you know? Gone.

02:41.142 --> 02:43.247
Hey, man, you're playing cards, right?

02:43.289 --> 02:45.416
Why don't you stick
to talking about cards?

02:45.457 --> 02:47.585
As long as you got
pussy and a cheeseburger,

02:47.626 --> 02:48.752
you're good, right, Willie?

02:48.794 --> 02:50.737
Yeah, man, I got mine.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.299
Oh, I want a cheeseburger.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.217
I want a cheeseburger!

02:55.259 --> 02:57.344
There's no cheeseburgers
in Mexico. I told you already.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.929
- Go find...
- Stop that. Stop that.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.514
You're driving me nuts with that.

03:00.556 --> 03:01.974
See what you did?

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.455 --> 03:26.540
They won't let you take me to Applebee's.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.376
- What?
- They said you can't take me.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.921
But then they said they don't
even have Applebee's here.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.126
Isn't that funny?

03:33.167 --> 03:34.924
- Who?
- What?

03:34.965 --> 03:36.383
Who said that?

03:36.425 --> 03:39.703
Those people. The-the people in the room.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.360
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.780
I'm gonna go find out
who the hell you are

03:57.821 --> 03:59.823
and what's going on.

04:05.788 --> 04:08.415
Oh. Oh, boy.
Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.042
Yeah, always calm, you know.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.294
- Wow, you're so fucking limber.
- Collected.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.214
So, that's yours.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.091
- You are so... Fuck.
- Right?

04:17.132 --> 04:19.718
That is so fucking nuts.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.222
Way so fucking fle-flexible.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.291
Hey. Hey.

04:24.316 --> 04:26.194
- Double down.
- Double down?

04:26.236 --> 04:27.559
My friend, here we go.

04:27.601 --> 04:32.481
- Hi, guys.
- Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.441
That's me, hello.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.318
- Take it home for grandma.
- There you go.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.071
- A new pair of shoes, baby.
- New pair of shoes.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.114
That's it.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.282
Guys, um, I must've been

04:42.324 --> 04:44.326
really shit-faced
last night or something,

04:44.368 --> 04:46.745
'cause I got no memory
of how this deal went down.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.914
So if you could fill me in,
I'd appreciate it.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.666
- One second. One sec. Go ahead.
- Geez.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.230
- Hey, man.
- Fucking pay attention.

04:52.271 --> 04:56.697
That-that Chinese girlfriend you
had, did she go back to sleep?

04:57.381 --> 04:58.882
If you're talking about
the girl back there,

04:58.924 --> 05:00.342
she ain't my girlfriend, no.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.261
- What...?
- I got no fucking clue who she is.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.596
So that's kind of what
I'm getting at here, you know.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.265
Oh, you had a clue last night, man.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.599
You definitely did.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.435
Yeah, well, I don't know about that.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.978
Yeah. What?

05:11.020 --> 05:12.354
Shut up.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.189
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.066
- Don't fucking cheat me, man.
- Hey, dude.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.568
- I'm not trying to make trouble.
- Excuse me.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.445
I'm not trying to make you upset.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.447
- What's going on, man?
- Yeah, we don't know.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.749
We don't know. Do we know anything?

05:23.791 --> 05:25.784
- I swear.
- That's yours.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.953
So, wait, she's not your girlfriend?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.164
No, like I said, no.
No, I don't know the girl.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.310
You see?

05:31.351 --> 05:33.959
Look, guys, no disrespect intended,

05:34.001 --> 05:36.587
but who the fuck are you
and why am I here?

05:36.628 --> 05:38.756
- We're government.
- What government?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.090
Valkenvania.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.800
Valkenvania.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.677
- Okay.
- We're here to protect you.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.456
- All right.
- All the information you got,

05:45.481 --> 05:46.597
you got from us.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.765
Now you know too much.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.766
Valkenvania.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.434
The Russians, the Americans,

05:50.476 --> 05:52.269
- everybody's looking for you.
- Are they?

05:52.311 --> 05:53.687
Yeah. Okay.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.272
All right, then.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.899
Read you loud and clear. Mm-hmm.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.317
Come on, guys. Cut the shit.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.302
Seriously, wh-what's going on?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.322
Is that an attitude
that I heard just then?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.531
No, he just doesn't remember shit.

06:04.573 --> 06:05.866
I think I heard a little attitude.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.666
I-I... Look, man, what kind of attitude

06:07.708 --> 06:09.703
would you have if you didn't
know where the fuck you were?

06:09.745 --> 06:11.205
I frankly don't give a fuck.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.332
You're gonna be here a while,
so just dig yourself,

06:13.373 --> 06:14.750
make yourself comfortable.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.424
Everybody's being very nice
to you right now.

06:16.465 --> 06:18.128
- Okay.
- Play the game.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.135
Why are you being like this? Why? Huh?

06:25.177 --> 06:28.931
- So, that one's mine.
- That's yours.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.849
- Thank you so much.
- You're not going anywhere.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.226
You're gonna be here a while, all right?

06:32.267 --> 06:33.894
So just, uh, you know, settle in.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.688
That's all, relax. Settle in.
Everybody settle in.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.357
All right. If you want to... you...

06:38.398 --> 06:39.399
I'll give you this game.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.400
- If you want it, you got it.
- Yeah.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.569
So, your friend's out front there?

06:42.611 --> 06:44.446
There's bars on the windows,
people outside.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.698
- You're not going anywhere, pal.
- Uh-huh.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.951
All right? Just settle in.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.452
We'll let you know when your time's up.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.454
We'll let you know when you can step out.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.582
All right? Unless you want us
to tie you up.

06:55.624 --> 06:56.875
Yeah.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.377
No, I'm not big on being tied up.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.003
All right,

07:00.045 --> 07:01.964
then just go back to your chick
in there or whatever.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.340
Be comfortable. Take it easy.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.300
Yeah, yeah, and stop asking questions.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.927
So, that's 460, right?

07:06.969 --> 07:08.637
This-this guy here, Mickey,

07:08.679 --> 07:10.055
he'll answer all your questions,

07:10.097 --> 07:12.015
and you really don't want to hear that.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.433
Hey, fuck off, Willie.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.810
We're just playing cards, all right?

07:14.852 --> 07:15.978
Let's go another round, all right?

07:16.019 --> 07:18.564
All right. Okay.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.649
So, I had a... had a phone on me

07:20.691 --> 07:23.026
and a pack of smokes.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.403
You guys know anything about that?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.280
You shouldn't smoke.
It's bad for you health.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.656
You should quit.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.449
Yeah, well, I-I do smoke, so...

07:31.493 --> 07:33.620
You better just, you know, walk away

07:33.662 --> 07:36.123
before your medical condition
has a change of status.

07:36.165 --> 07:37.833
Don't do that.

07:38.903 --> 07:40.034
It's you.

07:40.076 --> 07:41.461
That blows it for you.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.422
What? I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.424
- Fair and square, right?
- Shut up.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.050
The Chinese chick. Come on, what?

07:47.092 --> 07:48.552
I don't give a shit. I already told you.

08:07.429 --> 08:09.072
So, what's your name, anyway?

08:09.114 --> 08:11.241
Janet. I don't look like a Janet.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.243
What's your name?

08:13.285 --> 08:14.578
That's not important.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.038
Start laughing.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.956
- What?
- Just start laughing.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.416
Why?

08:19.458 --> 08:22.461
'Cause we're having fun,
just hanging out, okay?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.171
- Okay.
- Just do it.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.173
No, no. Don't like you're
a fucking lunatic.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.550
Like we're having fun,
just a casual conversation.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.135
Oh, okay.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.078
No, no. Okay, forget it.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.433
Okay, I-I need you

08:37.476 --> 08:39.019
to tell me what happened
and how we got here.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.313
I don't know.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.215
I mean, you know as much as I do.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.613
We were in a bar,

08:49.655 --> 08:51.031
and you were asking me

08:51.073 --> 08:53.033
for a ride to the border. That's right.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.036
But the guy that I was with,
who brought me there,

08:56.078 --> 08:58.664
he just... he got pissed off
for some reason,

08:58.705 --> 09:00.040
he just left.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.667
Oh, no, wait.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.585
You were not very nice to him.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.796
And he said he was gonna kick your ass.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.215
And then you said,
"Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna cut

09:08.257 --> 09:10.467
- your fucking throat."
- Shh.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.719
You were really drunk.
I mean, really drunk.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.973
Yeah, okay. All right, enough.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.767
Shut up. I said you don't
have to do that anymore, okay?

09:18.809 --> 09:20.811
- Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

09:21.853 --> 09:23.588
So, what else?

09:23.939 --> 09:25.232
I don't know. I just...

09:25.274 --> 09:27.317
I woke up on this bed next to you.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.195
I-I tried to wake you up,
but you were, like, dead.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.406
Except for the weird-ass noises you make.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.241
Do you have any idea? Like, it's just...

09:34.283 --> 09:35.492
Yeah, okay, okay. Come on.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.952
Tell me the rest.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.746
Then I went in there,
and, uh, they weren't...

09:39.788 --> 09:41.623
they weren't very talkative.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.083
Except for the guy and the girl.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.835
That's right. Willie was his name.

09:45.402 --> 09:47.337
He wants me... he wants me
to give him a blow job.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.172
Right in front of her he's saying that.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.008
Right... so creepy.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.092
Pipe down.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.761
Then one of them said...

09:54.803 --> 09:57.330
Yeah, they said... one of them said...

09:57.973 --> 09:59.933
they're waiting for the word.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.102
"So stop fucking asking me."

10:02.144 --> 10:04.980
I've got to ask you 'cause I got
to figure this shit out, okay?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.356
Oh, no. Not-not you. One of them said,

10:06.398 --> 10:07.858
"So stop fucking asking me."

10:07.899 --> 10:09.901
Okay.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.363
So, what word?

10:13.405 --> 10:15.032
I don't know.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.869
You know what,
I don't like blowjobs so much.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.120
I mean, I guess they're okay,

10:20.162 --> 10:21.621
but not really.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.707
And cum smells like poppies.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.334
No, no, no, not poppies.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.753
Tulips. Next time
you're in a flower garden,

10:27.794 --> 10:28.837
smell the tulips.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.088
Anything else?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.298
Nope, just tulips.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.884
No, anything else
about what they said in there?

10:33.925 --> 10:35.677
Don't know. I-I don't...

10:35.719 --> 10:37.596
They just sit around playing cards

10:37.637 --> 10:39.181
and argue about stuff.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.224
And you swear to God
you don't know these people?

10:41.266 --> 10:42.684
You've never seen them
in your life, right?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.770
No. Excuse me?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.772
I don't... Why would I? Do you know them?

10:46.813 --> 10:49.232
Uh, no. It's just
that you seem to remember a lot

10:49.274 --> 10:50.692
about what went on at the bar.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.943
I don't remember a fucking thing.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.403
Well, maybe I'm a little...

10:53.445 --> 10:55.096
I won't say it.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.449
Maybe I'm brighter than you.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.575
I don't know.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.160
Probably not.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.037
- Anyway... Shh.
- Look at me.

11:04.689 --> 11:06.666
Anyway, listen to me.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.047
Anything I tell you to do, just do it.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.882
- Okay.
- Every now and then,

11:13.924 --> 11:15.967
go in there,
just hang out with them. Okay?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.918
- Okay.
- Just act natural.

11:18.507 --> 11:19.763
Kind of play dumb,

11:19.805 --> 11:21.973
- you know.
- I think I can do that.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.583
All right.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.979
Anything they say, tell me about it.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.357
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.280
- Look, look, look.
- Hey, now. Hey, now.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.786
Ay, ay, ay. Ooh.

11:42.828 --> 11:46.206
These aren't, you know... That's not...

11:46.248 --> 11:49.366
Just, you know,
there are no purple horses.

11:49.407 --> 11:51.753
That's just 'cause you've never seen one.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.089
Because you're, uh,
like, you're-you're creative?

11:54.131 --> 11:55.715
No.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.509
'Cause there's definitely
fucking purple horses.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.303
Oh, yeah, right.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.579
What are you doing?

12:03.140 --> 12:04.683
Don't even think about it.

12:07.297 --> 12:08.441
I got that.

12:08.483 --> 12:10.272
Check it out first, man.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.943
All right.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.991
God bless America.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.409
- Gracias.
- All right.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.079
- What do you got?
- Here's lunch.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.331
- Nice. Ooh, still warm...
- Tamales.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.749
That's so interesting.

12:29.791 --> 12:33.003
That is so cool that, you know, like,

12:33.044 --> 12:36.173
you're really, like, you're Oriental.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.008
But I can't really tell

12:38.049 --> 12:40.051
if you're, like, Chinese or Japanese.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.512
Okay, Orientals are rugs.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.514
- Uh-huh.
- I'm Chinese. But not really.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.433
I'm this girl from Lemon Grove.

12:46.475 --> 12:49.478
- Lemon Grove? In San Diego?
- Yeah.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.772
I got a tattoo once
from a famous tattoo artist.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.566
Uh, hey, I'm gonna show you.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.234
- Oh, no, that's o... No.
- Hang on. No, I want to show you.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.491
- I'll show you. It's not...
- Okay.

12:57.533 --> 12:59.488
- It's not scary or anything.
- Hey.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.698
Don't be a fucking idiot.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.700
Wait, is this your business?

13:03.742 --> 13:04.993
Yeah, it is.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.329
Okay.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.955
All right.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.499
You know, you know what?

13:10.540 --> 13:13.460
We can go in the back room,

13:13.502 --> 13:16.630
and you can tell me, like... stories.

13:16.671 --> 13:17.839
I'm a good listener.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.758
W-What is it like to grow up Chinese?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.885
- That must have been really tough.
- You know what, I don't...

13:21.927 --> 13:24.176
I don't even speak Chinese. It's just...

13:24.218 --> 13:26.014
- You don't?
- ...shit is too hard, so...

13:26.056 --> 13:27.516
- You don't speak...?
- Don't say ni hao

13:27.557 --> 13:28.725
to me, please.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.227
That is so weird.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.270
Why don't you stop fucking talking?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.898
Two seconds. Eat.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.025
- She said it's okay.
- Eat.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.695
- Do you like it?
- I don't understand this movie.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.489
You don't speak Spanish, do you?

13:42.531 --> 13:44.407
I don't speak Spanish, either.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.703
You can learn Spanish.
It's not that hard.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.288
- Right?
- I don't think so.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.790
Even I... even I know a little Spanish.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.250
- Hey.
- Mickey?

13:53.291 --> 13:55.293
- You want something to eat?
- No, I'm good, bud.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.295
- You play cards?
- Yeah, sometimes.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.797
Yeah? Hey, maybe we play later.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.840
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- All right.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.162
So, uh...

14:06.763 --> 14:08.265
I'm just kind of wondering, you know,

14:08.306 --> 14:09.849
how long we're gonna play this game

14:09.891 --> 14:11.893
before you guys let me in on the joke.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.104
Is it money you want?
'Cause if it's money...

14:14.145 --> 14:16.189
- Money? Money?
- I understand, but...

14:16.231 --> 14:17.651
- You got money?
- No, that's the point.

14:17.676 --> 14:18.801
I don't have any money.

14:18.842 --> 14:22.028
- So, I have to make a phone call, see?
- We don't want your money, man.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.322
We just babysit you until we
ain't babysittin' you anymore.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.076
- Will you just stop talking!
- I don't need any babysittin'.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.453
What good is he?

14:32.330 --> 14:36.001
I'm sorry. Listen, you know
what happened to me once?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.360
I actually...

14:38.086 --> 14:40.338
broke my dick in-inside a chick.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.173
- Did you know that could happen?
- That's... No.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.383
- Yeah, I broke it.
- Interesting.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.218
Completely. All right? But it healed.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.928
- You can do that?
- And now...

14:46.970 --> 14:49.973
I have, like, this, like,
like, perfect little curve...

14:50.015 --> 14:52.350
- Oh. Congratulations.
- Rub my feet.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.602
Will you... Come on!

14:53.643 --> 14:55.284
- Rub them.
- Babe, babe.

14:55.326 --> 14:56.326
Babe, you're...

14:56.351 --> 14:57.525
- you're pushing your luck.
- Rub them.

14:57.566 --> 14:58.898
You fucking jealous or something?

14:58.940 --> 15:01.401
- No. I don't give a fuck.
- Do me a favor, just... just put

15:01.443 --> 15:03.862
- your hand right here and rub her...
- Oh, no, that's okay. Thank you.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.572
What do you mean, no?!

15:05.614 --> 15:07.657
Will you fuckin' rub her feet?

15:07.699 --> 15:10.076
God! Uh, no... like...

15:10.118 --> 15:11.703
I'm good.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.288
Can I help you?

15:13.330 --> 15:14.789
Sick puppy.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.374
Look...

15:19.502 --> 15:22.380
If I'm gonna be here, um...

15:23.031 --> 15:25.241
for however long it is, um...

15:26.117 --> 15:28.261
I got kind of problems with the pipes,

15:28.303 --> 15:31.122
so I'll need some tea
or something, you know?

15:32.057 --> 15:33.600
Hey. Psst. Hey. Psst.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.560
Boiling water and a lemon, anything.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.646
You got any tea for him in the kitchen?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.814
- Uh, it's in the drawer.
- Go.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.025
By the stove on the right.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.860
- All right.
- Whoa, whoa, not you. Not you.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.362
- What?
- Come here. Mickey, make him some tea.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.072
- I don't know how to make tea.
- You sit right here.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.698
- Do me a favor.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.700
- You don't know how to make tea?
- Goddamn it.

15:50.742 --> 15:54.829
You boil the fucking water
and you put the tea bag in it.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.081
- I'm watching you.
- Can you fucking handle that?!

15:56.122 --> 15:58.083
All right, all right, I gotcha. I gotcha.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.293
Someone's a little on edge.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.879
Oh, you're laughing now?

16:02.921 --> 16:05.298
Stop asking everybody questions
and squirreling around here.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.634
- I don't like it.
- So fucking nuts. You know that?

16:07.676 --> 16:10.887
- Yeah, that's right.
- And you, too.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.681
- What?
- Fuckin' waste of sperm, you.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.015

16:14.057 --> 16:15.850

16:17.894 --> 16:19.020
Hey.

16:26.778 --> 16:30.365

16:30.407 --> 16:32.325
So, Mickey, where you from originally?

16:32.367 --> 16:33.702
- Me?
- Yeah.

16:33.743 --> 16:34.869
- East Coast.
- Yeah?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.037
Where are you from?

16:36.079 --> 16:38.751
Was born in Alabama.
Went to school in Indiana.

16:38.793 --> 16:40.500
Ended up in L.A. Been there ever since.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.961
- L.A.'s nice.
- Yeah, it is. Good town.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.088
Hey, I got a question for you.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.048
- Yeah?
- You're a lawyer, right?

16:47.090 --> 16:48.633
Who said that?
I didn't say I was a lawyer.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.052
No, you said it, uh,
when you were shit-faced.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.422
No.

16:52.463 --> 16:54.247
Let me ask you a question.

16:55.832 --> 16:58.017
Where exactly was I shit-faced?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.687
It was in, uh, you know...

17:00.729 --> 17:02.981
that place...

17:03.022 --> 17:04.983
before y... you came here.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.943
You don't remember anything, do ya?

17:06.984 --> 17:08.778
No, I don't.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.865
- Well.
- Well...

17:12.606 --> 17:14.492
Listen, I got something
I wanted to talk to you about.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.535
Okay.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.203
I-I wrote this book.

17:17.244 --> 17:21.207
Uh, except it's in my head, you know?

17:21.249 --> 17:24.002
And it could just knock
the world on its ass.

17:24.527 --> 17:26.003
It's deep shit.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.423
- Okay.
- And I wrote this music, too.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.367
The world... the world needs to hear it.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.679
You ever feel like, you know,
you're the smartest guy

17:34.721 --> 17:36.306
in the room but nobody will listen?

17:36.347 --> 17:39.392
Yeah. Yeah, I usually feel
like the dumbest guy in the room

17:39.434 --> 17:41.019
and nobody'll listen to me.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.896
Exactly. Yeah.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.898
Anyway, do you... How do you copyright?

17:44.939 --> 17:46.818
Do you copyright ideas?

17:46.860 --> 17:50.361
Or, uh... would...
Like, I have music on a tape.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.923
- Right.
- So it's on a tape.

17:51.965 --> 17:52.962
- Right.
- Right?

17:52.987 --> 17:54.532
You know a lot about copyrighting.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.755
- 'Cause you're a lawyer. Right?
- I didn't say...

17:56.797 --> 17:57.737
No, I didn't...

17:57.762 --> 17:58.828
No, if you could just
give me some pointers.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.168
I don't really know much

18:00.210 --> 18:01.206
- about copyrighting,
- Shit.

18:01.247 --> 18:05.710
But, uh, I'll check it out,
see if I know anybody.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.091
- So, what kind of book is it, anyways?
- I think we should end

18:12.133 --> 18:14.052
this little tête-à-tête
we got going here.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.136
Vis à vis your conversation.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.763
Yeah, just waiting for that tea, bud.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.473
So, sorry.

18:18.873 --> 18:20.725
- Don't forget your tea.
- Yeah.

18:22.293 --> 18:24.145
Hey, I'll think
about that copyright thing.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.106
- Maybe I'll know somebody, right?
- Yeah, you got your tea. Friend.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.674
Come on.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.110
It's chamomile tea.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.862
It'll put him right to sleep.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.826
Listen,

18:37.867 --> 18:40.286
just give me a little peck on the mouth.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.080
A little peck on the mouth.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.666
- Uh...
- No, no. Ugh.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.971
Can I lay on you?

19:01.266 --> 19:03.434
Sure. Why not?

19:13.678 --> 19:16.364
Will you put your arm around me?
I'm kind of cold.

19:29.569 --> 19:33.214
So, is the playboy
still hitting on you out there?

19:33.256 --> 19:34.574
Yeah.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.386
He wants me to see his "perfect curve."

19:38.428 --> 19:40.305
- Jesus.
- I know.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.849
I told him I wasn't dying to see it.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.101
Yeah, I don't blame you.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.948
Listen.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.243
I want you to keep it up with him, okay?

20:02.285 --> 20:04.937
I mean, keep shutting him down, but...

20:05.938 --> 20:08.458
just flirt with him
a little bit, just enough.

20:08.499 --> 20:11.002
Just enough to keep him semi-interested.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.378
All right?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.630
What?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.465
Why? Why?

20:16.674 --> 20:19.135
Trust me.

20:22.478 --> 20:23.896
Okay.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.046
How about the rest of them,
what are they doing?

20:32.173 --> 20:34.717
Um, bald guy's reading a magazine.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.612
And the girl's just sitting there.

20:38.220 --> 20:41.265
I think she's playing a game
on her phone.

20:42.391 --> 20:45.019
The creep is on the couch next to her.

20:46.395 --> 20:48.606
But I didn't see the crazy guy.

20:49.815 --> 20:53.336
I did hear some snoring
in the other room, though, so...

20:53.378 --> 20:55.630
I guess that's him.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.090
Yeah.

21:06.474 --> 21:10.127
Did you hear any more details
about what they're up to?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.480
No.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.691
Nobody's talking.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.283
You should get some sleep, okay?

21:24.325 --> 21:26.160
You may need it.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.329
Okay.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.462
Where are you going?

21:36.504 --> 21:39.465
I just need to go in there
for a minute, okay?

21:39.507 --> 21:40.842
It's all right.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.593
- Okay.
- You just go to sleep.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.095
Okay.

21:53.024 --> 21:54.317
Hey.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.671
Yeah?

21:56.713 --> 21:59.569
Promise me you won't leave me here.

22:00.094 --> 22:01.446
I promise.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.264
Whatcha reading there, bud?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.477
A book.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.896
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.859
You remember Mad magazine?

22:39.901 --> 22:41.819
- You ever read that?
- Alfred E. Neuman.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.321
"What, me worry?"

22:43.362 --> 22:46.240
You're pushing it, buddy,
let me tell you somethin'.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.661
You Puerto Rican?

22:50.703 --> 22:53.052
- Pushing it.
- No, I was just asking.

22:53.094 --> 22:54.707
I mean, you guys are down here in Mexico.

22:54.749 --> 22:57.376
I don't know, you guys
all seem to be, uh...

22:57.418 --> 22:59.837
you seem like a New Yorker kind to me.

23:01.655 --> 23:03.758
You're pushing for an injury, my friend.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.427
Look, I'm gonna... I want
to make some tea, all right?

23:06.469 --> 23:07.845
Hey. Psst.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.347
I'm not going anywhere.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.140
Hold it. Ho-ho-ho-ho.

23:12.183 --> 23:13.476
Get him a tea, will you?

23:13.518 --> 23:15.686
Do it. What's your problem?

23:15.728 --> 23:18.272
- What are you, English?
- Actually, I did that, uh,

23:18.314 --> 23:19.732
DNA test.

23:20.424 --> 23:22.860
You know, you spit in a tube,
figure out who you are and shit.

23:22.902 --> 23:26.280
73% fuckin' full-on teabag.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.241
- Imagine that.
- Yeah. Family told me

23:28.282 --> 23:30.868
I was Irish, but... I guess I am, partly.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.834
Cup. No sense washing another one, right?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.944
I don't care what cup you use.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.506
Appreciate you doing this.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.925
Did it look like I had a choice?

23:46.408 --> 23:48.052
I'm not doing you a fuckin' favor.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.720
All right.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.306
So, how'd you wind up in Mexico?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.143
I don't know.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.186
Yeah, me, neither.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.731
You seem like a girl
that would be from, like,

24:00.773 --> 24:04.402
Grand Rapids, Michigan,
or, like, Port Huron.

24:05.261 --> 24:06.654
That's random.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.448
Yeah, people say that about me sometimes.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.534
Hmm.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.227
Where are you from?

24:14.728 --> 24:16.747
Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.833
No shit, huh?

24:18.875 --> 24:20.835
- Yeah, shit.
- Iowa.

24:21.652 --> 24:23.379
I dated a girl from Iowa.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.590
Sucks for her.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.425
She was a basketball player.

24:27.783 --> 24:29.886
Probably a basket case, too.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.514
Middle America.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.516
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.143
Hey, listen, um,

24:37.185 --> 24:39.979
not to be a pain in the ass...
I know I already am,

24:40.021 --> 24:42.460
but it ain't easy
being a hostage, you see...

24:42.502 --> 24:45.301
could I get one of those lemons
cut up in my tea?

24:48.696 --> 24:50.323
Great.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.452
Lemons... we got.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.495
- Huh.
- They're everywhere.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.539
Fucking place.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.402
Thank you.

25:06.780 --> 25:09.175
You don't eat, you just, like, drink tea?

25:09.217 --> 25:10.593
I eat sometimes.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.678
I forget to a lot of times.

25:13.662 --> 25:15.223
Mm. Probably shouldn't do that.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.099
Yeah, I know.

25:19.627 --> 25:22.188
Don't look like you eat much.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.714
Were you ever a model?

25:24.774 --> 25:27.151
What are you talking about?

25:27.193 --> 25:28.444
No, seriously.

25:28.486 --> 25:30.780
I mean, you seem like it.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.493
No.

25:35.851 --> 25:38.955
- That's really stupid.
- Well, they missed out on it, then.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.624
You could have fooled me.

25:41.666 --> 25:44.418
All right, knock it off,
lovebirds, all right?

25:44.460 --> 25:46.504
Give him the tea already. Knock it off.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.464
Yeah, okay.

25:48.506 --> 25:49.924
Here.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.093
Your little girlfriend's an idiot.

25:52.134 --> 25:55.888
Like I said, she isn't my girlfriend.

25:56.205 --> 25:58.808
Hey, lovebirds, knock it off!

25:58.849 --> 26:00.814
- Yeah. Sorry.
- That's it. Fun's over.

26:00.856 --> 26:03.688
Had a little problem with the tea.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.234
So, uh, yeah.

26:08.759 --> 26:12.576
You look like my buddy Gabriel's
sister a little bit.

26:12.618 --> 26:14.657
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah. Pretty skinny.

26:14.699 --> 26:16.784
You got a model's body,
sorry to tell you.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.203
- Shut up.
- You do, honey.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.648
Just curious.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.543
It's like a Bible name, right?

26:25.584 --> 26:26.902
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.631
- Well, maybe we...
- All right, party's over, you two.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.300
Yeah, you got it. You got it, buddy.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.719
- Maybe we can talk later, okay?
- Yeah, um...

26:34.760 --> 26:37.138
So anyway, thanks a lot
for this. Appreciate it.

26:37.179 --> 26:40.891
Yeah. You're a sweet girl.
I really appreciate this.

26:45.980 --> 26:48.232
- What, are you on a date?
- What is your fucking problem?

26:48.274 --> 26:49.383
Did you give him your number?

26:50.985 --> 26:52.486
Oh, God.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.698
- Move your fucking head.
- Oh, God. What happened?

27:56.217 --> 27:59.095
Oh, great. I didn't want to wake you up,

27:59.136 --> 28:01.138
but I'm glad you woke up, though.

28:01.180 --> 28:05.142
- I heard something.
- What?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.769
I went in the hallway last night.

28:06.811 --> 28:09.146
You were asleep,

28:09.188 --> 28:11.857
and I heard them talking,
but it wasn't too loud,

28:11.899 --> 28:15.653
so I snuck in and I was against the wall,

28:15.694 --> 28:17.763
like, really flat like this.

28:18.656 --> 28:21.784
And Mickey, he said, "Where
are they dropping them off?"

28:21.826 --> 28:24.620
No, no, wait, I'm sorry. The, um, wait.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.372
It's the bald guy, the bald guy.

28:26.414 --> 28:31.335
They still haven't said his
name. He said he got the call.

28:32.809 --> 28:35.172
And then Mickey
said that about, you know,

28:35.214 --> 28:36.841
"Where are they dropping them off?"

28:36.882 --> 28:39.927
Then the other guy said,
"No, it's changed.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.471
We're supposed to finish the deal."

28:43.372 --> 28:45.641
Then this morning, they-they,

28:45.683 --> 28:48.561
they started getting, like, really busy

28:48.602 --> 28:51.355
and-and-and taking things outside

28:51.397 --> 28:54.483
and they were coming in and out,
and I saw Mickey.

28:54.525 --> 28:57.695
He was talking to three guys
in a black car

28:57.736 --> 28:59.864
because I saw through-through the door

28:59.905 --> 29:01.949
when they opened it just for a minute.

29:01.991 --> 29:06.203
And then, um, I saw
through that door that, uh,

29:06.245 --> 29:09.331
Mickey was loading
some bags into a truck.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.333
They were really busy,

29:11.375 --> 29:14.503
and-and they were
kind of intense and-and arguing.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.797
Mickey and the bald guy.

29:16.839 --> 29:21.218
And they said, "When it
gets dark..." something.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.262
- What?
- I couldn't hear what...

29:25.998 --> 29:27.766
Uh-huh.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.938
What's up?

29:32.980 --> 29:36.150
Not much. Too early to tell yet.
How 'bout you?

29:42.781 --> 29:45.017
Chinese chicks.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.792
- So what do you...
- Close the door.

29:55.878 --> 29:57.463
Quietly.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.970
So what do you think?

30:05.012 --> 30:07.122
What do you think that means?

30:11.810 --> 30:15.898
Okay. I want you to listen
to me very carefully, all right?

30:15.940 --> 30:17.525
- Okay.
- All right.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.778
In a little while,
I want you to go in there,

30:20.819 --> 30:22.947
and I want you to sit down with
him just like usual, all right?

30:22.988 --> 30:24.198
Okay.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.035
You know, resist that creep
and everything, but...

30:28.077 --> 30:29.620
you know, be a little flirtatious

30:29.662 --> 30:31.247
- with him, you know.
- Okay, okay.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.165
- Just keep flirting with him.
- Okay.

30:33.207 --> 30:35.292
- Until I get in there.
- Okay.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.653
- I'm gonna come in there.
- Yeah.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.674
And I'm gonna ask the girl
to make me some tea.

30:41.715 --> 30:42.800
Okay.

30:42.841 --> 30:43.968
- When she does,
- Mm-hmm.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.803
- And hopefully she will...
- Yeah.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.971
...look over at me.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.516
- Okay.
- And if I give you the nod...

30:50.558 --> 30:52.351
Uh-huh.

30:52.393 --> 30:54.853
...you tell him you want to see
that dick thing of his,

30:54.895 --> 30:56.897
whatever it is, the curve or whatever.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.441
- Okay... Yeah.
- Got me?

30:59.483 --> 31:02.027
And then I want you
to bring him back here.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.835
- Here?
- Bring him back... yes.

31:03.877 --> 31:04.932
- Bring him back here
- In this, this room?

31:04.957 --> 31:06.615
- And get him on the bed.
- Okay.

31:06.657 --> 31:08.701
Now, once you get his pants down...

31:08.742 --> 31:10.619
Oh, no, I can't blow this guy.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.580
Hey, listen to me, goddamn it.
Listen to me.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.249
Do you want to fucking die,
or you want to blow that creep?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.167
- No, okay-okay.
- Huh? I'd blow him myself,

31:17.209 --> 31:18.586
but I don't think he'd be interested.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.113
Okay, okay. I got it. Okay.

31:22.698 --> 31:24.800
So anyway, you get him relaxed,

31:24.842 --> 31:26.844
you fuck around with him and everything.

31:26.885 --> 31:30.222
When you get him all readied up
and he's all into it

31:30.264 --> 31:33.350
and all this kind of thing,
right under that blanket

31:33.392 --> 31:35.102
wedged in the mattress right there,

31:35.144 --> 31:37.963
there's a knife, okay?

31:38.356 --> 31:42.276
A long knife. Now I want you...

31:42.318 --> 31:44.153
Don't fuck with it.
I've got it just right.

31:44.194 --> 31:46.447
I know. I'm just gonna look at it.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.200
Oh, shit.

31:50.242 --> 31:53.162
God, it's huge. Okay.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.247
Just find an opportunity, okay?

31:55.289 --> 31:57.625
- Okay.
- When you get the opportunity,

31:57.666 --> 31:59.376
I want you to take the knife,

31:59.418 --> 32:02.254
I want you to jam it
right up through his balls...

32:02.296 --> 32:04.882
- No. No.
- Listen to me.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.717
As hard as you can,

32:06.759 --> 32:08.886
- right up into him.
- Oh, my God.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.888
I want you to bury it in him,
do you understand me?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.390
Bury it in him and, immediately,

32:13.432 --> 32:14.475
pull it out.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.783
- Don't forget that part.
- You do that part.

32:16.825 --> 32:18.729
You do that part.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.230
I'm not gonna be here, honey.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.107
- You don't understand. I...
- You... Listen.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.401
These fucking people are gonna
kill us, do you understand me?

32:24.443 --> 32:27.905
I... What if it goes wrong?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.740
If it goes wrong, they fucking kill us.

32:29.782 --> 32:32.493
It's the only chance we got.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.995
Okay. Okay.

32:35.037 --> 32:37.790
Jam it up in him all the way,

32:37.831 --> 32:40.042
and then when you pull it out,

32:40.084 --> 32:43.504
I want you to get up and run
toward that back door out there,

32:43.545 --> 32:46.465
screaming bloody murder. Hear me?

32:46.507 --> 32:48.050
At the top of your lungs.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.010
And I'll meet you at the back door.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.888
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

32:53.806 --> 32:55.474
- Sure.
- Hey.

32:55.516 --> 32:57.351
- You got to get going.
- Where's my fucking toothbrush?

32:57.393 --> 32:59.937
- I know, I know, I know. I know!
- Where's my fucking toothbrush?

32:59.978 --> 33:02.940
- Where's my fucking toothbrush?
- You know what, you know what?

33:02.981 --> 33:05.567
- I don't know you.
- Shit. Fucking used

33:05.609 --> 33:08.320
- my toothbrush again.
- Fuck, the green thing?

33:08.362 --> 33:09.863
The green toothbrush.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.157
- Where is it?
- I don't know, babe.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.660
- I'll get you a new one.
- I want that one!

33:14.702 --> 33:17.121
What's all the hubbub, guys?

33:18.831 --> 33:21.291
Um... nothing.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.710
Hey, listen.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.128
I know you're in the middle of it,

33:24.169 --> 33:25.348
but I-I need another tea
and I'm afraid...

33:25.390 --> 33:27.673
Goddamn it! I'm busy.

33:27.715 --> 33:29.091
I'm not your fucking room service.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.759
I understand.
Look, I'll go ask the boss...

33:30.801 --> 33:32.511
No, no, no, no, no. I-I...

33:32.553 --> 33:33.929
No, don't be a dick.

33:33.971 --> 33:35.764
I'll make you your fucking tea.

33:44.857 --> 33:47.109
- So what was happening?
- I don't know.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.111
I don't know. You really want to?

33:49.153 --> 33:50.904
- You really want to?
- I do. I do.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.270
- Come on.
- So,

33:52.295 --> 33:53.782
seriously, wh-where you guys headed?

33:53.824 --> 33:55.617
And why you packing up so quick?

33:55.659 --> 33:57.975
Are you guys leaving out of here?

33:58.017 --> 34:00.164
- Are we going?
- Come on.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.565
Or is it just you?

34:03.942 --> 34:06.086
Oh. Okay.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.505
I mean, and-and look at them.
Jesus Christ.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.799
- No, this bedroom.
- No, no, this is my room here.

34:10.841 --> 34:11.925
- No, no, th-this bedroom.
- No.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.011
I'm not going in there
with all that jizz.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.554
- That's his shit. Right here.
- No, I like this bedroom.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.097
- No, right here. No, right here.
- No, this bedroom's much...

34:17.139 --> 34:19.391
- Right here, right here.
- Hey! Hey!

34:19.433 --> 34:21.018
Hey, what? Hey, what? I'm just...

34:21.059 --> 34:22.686
Is that how easy it is for you?

34:22.728 --> 34:25.188
I sit here and put on a
fucking act to protect your ass,

34:25.230 --> 34:26.297
and this is what I get?

34:26.322 --> 34:27.815
- The first fucking time.
- No, no, I'll be right back.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.652
- And you grab him by the fucking hand?
- What are you doing?

34:30.694 --> 34:32.737
Listen, you have to get
your shit together. Go, go.

34:32.780 --> 34:33.889
No, no, go with him.

34:33.915 --> 34:35.657
- I don't give a shit, go with him.
- I'll be right back.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.618
- This is ridiculous.
- Okay, I'll be right back. It's okay.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.119
- You're ridiculous.
- It's okay, honey.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.411
What do we do? What do I do?

34:40.454 --> 34:42.623
Pull your dress up, pull your dress up.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.500
Fucking married.

34:44.541 --> 34:47.210
- Oh, okay.
- Hey, hey, come on.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.337
- Yes, I'm here.
- You know what? Take her.

34:48.378 --> 34:49.670
I don't give a shit.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.799
- Just fucking take her.
- Yeah, I will.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.426
- It's here. I'm...
- Do whatever you want at this point.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.469
- I could give a fuck less.
- Come on, China.

34:56.512 --> 34:58.180
I don't know how you take this stuff.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.723
Is that his M.O.? Is that what he does

34:59.765 --> 35:01.683
- all the fucking time?
- I don't know.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.480
- We got to get going.
- Goddamn it.

35:06.522 --> 35:08.173
Let's go.

35:09.615 --> 35:12.236
I know. More tea. Sorry.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.388
Hate to break up the meeting,
missy. We got work to do.

35:18.575 --> 35:19.993
Could you tell me

35:20.035 --> 35:21.037
about what's been

35:21.062 --> 35:22.246

- Stop.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.228
You don't even seem

35:23.253 --> 35:24.289
- to fit with these guys.
- Stop.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.250
You seem like a good guy, all right?

35:26.291 --> 35:27.709
So can you just talk to me?

35:27.751 --> 35:29.253
What's with all the weaponry and shit?

35:29.294 --> 35:30.504
You guys gonna do something to us?

35:30.546 --> 35:33.423
Seriously, could you tell me?
Tell me anything.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.158
I can help you.

35:35.717 --> 35:38.387
God!

35:38.428 --> 35:41.014
What the fuck?

35:43.141 --> 35:45.435
Willie!

35:45.477 --> 35:47.729
Willy? Oh, God.

35:47.771 --> 35:48.939
What happened?

35:48.981 --> 35:51.400
- Jesus!
- Come on, come on, come on.

35:51.441 --> 35:55.195
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go.

35:55.237 --> 35:56.822
Open the door, open the door,
open the door.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.073
I can't see!

35:58.115 --> 36:00.409
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.245
Run.

36:03.287 --> 36:04.663
Come on, honey, run.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.126
All right. Goddamn it.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.795
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.297
Go.

36:17.634 --> 36:18.802
Where you going?

36:18.844 --> 36:20.262
Why did you throw the fucking knife?

36:20.304 --> 36:23.640
- Come on. Come on.
- I didn't want it!

36:31.106 --> 36:32.608
Go, go, go.

36:44.286 --> 36:46.288
Go, go, go. Come on.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.169
Hold this. Hold this.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.593
Give me the gun. Come here.
Put your leg over.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.053
Come on.

37:05.933 --> 37:07.976
- What, what?
- Come on.

37:08.018 --> 37:09.186
Come on, come on.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.993
They're coming! They're coming!

37:42.970 --> 37:44.346
What's gonna happen?

37:44.388 --> 37:46.139
- Where do we go?
- Goddamn.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.349
Where are we going?

37:47.391 --> 37:49.601
- Just keep your fingers crossed.
- Did we lose those guys?

37:49.643 --> 37:51.311
What happened? What's gonna happen?

37:51.353 --> 37:54.523
Is this it? Is this where
we're gonna die? Oh, my God.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.149
Come on.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.651
Which way? Which way?

37:57.693 --> 38:00.529
- Go, go, go, go, go. Just run.
- Which way?

38:09.997 --> 38:12.916
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Okay, okay.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.127
Hi. Which way is town? Pueblo?

38:15.168 --> 38:17.045
Donde?

38:17.087 --> 38:19.381
This way? Stay back, back, back, back.

38:19.423 --> 38:22.217
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

38:25.762 --> 38:26.972
- Go, run. Back.
- Okay.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.392
You're a deadman.

39:28.658 --> 39:31.036
Coming through, coming through!

39:31.078 --> 39:32.788
- You see him?
- I don't see him.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.498
Step aside.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.299
Watch yourself.

39:44.341 --> 39:45.825
Can you see him?

39:46.676 --> 39:48.512
Hey, buddy, come here, come here.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.889
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Andale.

39:50.931 --> 39:52.140
Estoy peligro, okay?

39:52.182 --> 39:54.059
So you need to help her,
you need to take her away.

39:54.101 --> 39:55.060
Proteccion, okay?

39:55.102 --> 39:56.895
Listen, my name's Billy McBride.

39:56.937 --> 39:58.605
I'm from Santa Monica, California.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.107
I'm easy to find. You saved my life.

40:00.148 --> 40:01.233
- Now go. Take her away.
- No, no.

40:01.274 --> 40:02.275
- Go, go, go.
- No, no, no.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.485
- I-I want to come with you.
- Go, go, go.

40:03.527 --> 40:04.528
No, no, no.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.321
Billy, no, don't leave me.

40:30.637 --> 40:31.805
Hey, buddy.

40:31.847 --> 40:33.640
San Diego. Where's San Diego?

40:33.682 --> 40:35.058
Which direction, San Diego?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.810
I don't understand that!

40:36.852 --> 40:38.979
San Diego. English?

40:39.020 --> 40:40.463
Follow the orange line.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.568
Why didn't you say so? Goddamn it.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.451
- Hey, buddy.
- Sir, we're out of ears.

40:53.493 --> 40:54.911
- I know it's a problem.
- No, no, no, listen.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.164
It's not that. Hold on. Which
way is the border and how far?

40:57.205 --> 40:58.331
30 miles. Maps are on

40:58.373 --> 40:59.624
- the rack by the door.
- Okay, you got a phone?

40:59.666 --> 41:00.792
Local calls only.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.377
- Goddamn it.
- There he is, there he is.

41:02.419 --> 41:05.005
Hey, employees only back there!

41:16.349 --> 41:18.643
Got you, you little pussy.

41:19.561 --> 41:22.939
Hey, asshole! You're a deadman.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.983
Yeah, screw your mother!

41:25.025 --> 41:27.444
You're target practice, baby.

41:29.571 --> 41:30.947
See, where you going? Bull's-eye.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.449
Put your gun away.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.992
Hey!

41:34.034 --> 41:36.161
How you doing?

41:36.203 --> 41:37.370
Oh, wow.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.538
- Huh?
- Hey.

41:38.580 --> 41:39.873
- You look like my sister.
- All right,

41:39.915 --> 41:41.791
let's get out of here.

41:57.766 --> 41:59.267
Are you awake?

42:02.062 --> 42:06.024
Yeah. Yeah.

42:06.066 --> 42:07.634
Are you?

42:08.509 --> 42:12.739
Uh, yeah, I just spoke, so I'm awake.

42:13.848 --> 42:15.784
How you doing?

42:15.825 --> 42:17.268
Um...

42:18.328 --> 42:20.580
I don't know, I feel
a little weird, but I'm okay.

42:21.397 --> 42:22.832
Weird like how?

42:22.874 --> 42:25.252
Like, weird weird. Like I feel weird.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.296
What do you feel weird about?

42:28.338 --> 42:30.840
Everything, I don't know.
You don't feel weird at all?

42:30.882 --> 42:32.509
- No.
- Really?

42:32.550 --> 42:34.160
- Mm-mm.
- That's weird.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.747
Oh, shit.

42:38.473 --> 42:39.808
- Do you want me to... okay.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

42:39.849 --> 42:41.601
Nope. That's fine.

42:41.643 --> 42:42.919
Yeah?

42:44.604 --> 42:46.214
Okay, yeah. When?

42:47.399 --> 42:49.526
Uh, yeah, look, just tell Cassidy

42:49.567 --> 42:52.112
that I'll meet him at the
donut place in an hour, okay?

42:52.153 --> 42:53.405
All right.

42:53.446 --> 42:56.574
Was that about Julio?

42:56.616 --> 42:57.993
No. No, no, no. It was...

42:58.034 --> 43:00.036
You're still gonna look
into it though, right?

43:00.078 --> 43:02.163
Yeah. I promise you.

43:02.205 --> 43:03.707
Okay, because he didn't kill himself.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.483
- I know.
- Okay.

43:12.824 --> 43:14.384
- I promise you.
- Okay.

43:16.636 --> 43:17.804
What?

43:18.621 --> 43:19.973
You want to have coffee with me?

43:20.540 --> 43:21.725
Yes.

43:22.208 --> 43:23.226
Yeah?

43:23.835 --> 43:25.603
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:25.645 --> 43:27.647
I'm just gonna hop in the shower
so give me a couple minutes.

43:27.689 --> 43:28.690
Okay.

43:33.136 --> 43:34.696
Do you want me to put your phone back?

43:34.738 --> 43:37.532
- Uh, yeah, sure. That's fine.
- Yes.

43:46.916 --> 43:48.251
- Oh, hey.
- Yes.

43:49.652 --> 43:51.379
You look beautiful in the morning.

43:51.421 --> 43:54.132
- No, you know I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

45:32.147 --> 45:34.315
Hi. Yep.

45:37.860 --> 45:39.153
- Hi.
- Hey.

45:40.638 --> 45:41.990
No coffee?

45:42.031 --> 45:43.992
No, I had to go and I didn't
want to bother you

45:44.033 --> 45:45.160
when you were in the shower.

45:45.807 --> 45:48.268
Right. Right.

45:49.414 --> 45:51.082
Well, I'm really glad that you came over.

45:51.124 --> 45:52.542
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

45:52.584 --> 45:54.318
Me, too. I'm also glad.

45:55.361 --> 45:57.505
- All right.
- Okay.

45:57.547 --> 45:58.715
I'll call you later.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.425
I'd like that.

46:00.467 --> 46:02.093
- Okay.
- Drive safe.

46:02.135 --> 46:03.619
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Yep.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.849
Oh, now you fucking work. Okay.

46:14.147 --> 46:15.815
I'm-I'm gonna make my comments

46:15.857 --> 46:17.609
in the near future, so I'm sorry,

46:17.650 --> 46:21.112
I can't comment any...

46:21.154 --> 46:23.281
There's nothing I can tell
right now, I'm so sorry.

46:26.201 --> 46:28.453
There's nothing I can say right now.

46:33.291 --> 46:36.211
I wasn't prepared for any of this.

46:43.618 --> 46:45.220
Did your dad get home okay?

46:46.596 --> 46:48.640
I was gonna ask you the same question.

46:48.681 --> 46:49.933
He didn't come home with you?

46:51.167 --> 46:54.229
When he heard about Julio,
he started drinking.

46:54.879 --> 46:57.899
He felt very self-destructive
and I couldn't help him.

46:57.941 --> 47:00.276
He just took a bottle and left.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.595
I don't know where he went.

47:04.239 --> 47:06.176
I'm sure he's okay.

47:06.217 --> 47:10.078
Just... let me know
if you hear anything from him.

47:10.645 --> 47:12.872
Sure.

47:13.439 --> 47:14.749
Thank you.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.934
Well, hello.

47:32.976 --> 47:34.227
Hi.

47:35.812 --> 47:38.398
Did you speak to Senator Briggs
about your new job?

47:38.439 --> 47:39.649
Yeah.

47:39.691 --> 47:41.192
Good.

47:43.620 --> 47:45.372
What's on your mind?

47:46.239 --> 47:48.199
These, um,

47:48.241 --> 47:50.618
past few weeks, it's...

47:51.018 --> 47:52.912
it's like you've become
a different person.

47:52.954 --> 47:55.707
The meetings, the weird phone calls,

47:55.748 --> 47:56.958
- the guy with the hook.
- Well, Elena,

47:57.000 --> 47:58.793
you have to play the game to win.

47:58.835 --> 48:00.420
Oh, I know you're gonna win.

48:00.461 --> 48:02.196
There's no doubt.

48:03.172 --> 48:04.882
But I know you're a fraud.

48:05.658 --> 48:08.803
Look, I understand
you're upset about being let go.

48:08.845 --> 48:10.805
I spoke to your old
elementary school teacher.

48:10.847 --> 48:11.806
Mm.

48:11.848 --> 48:13.308
In your hometown.

48:13.349 --> 48:14.934
Sister Maria Isabella?

48:14.976 --> 48:17.061
The sister knew you by a different name.

48:17.670 --> 48:19.188
Claudia Quintero.

48:19.880 --> 48:23.026
- That name means nothing to me.
- Right.

48:23.067 --> 48:26.029
Because Claudia Quintero doesn't
exist in any public record.

48:26.470 --> 48:28.306
It's like she's a ghost.

48:29.348 --> 48:32.493
You're very nosy, Elena.

48:35.354 --> 48:37.165
Do you want money?

48:37.206 --> 48:39.042
No.

48:39.083 --> 48:40.627
So why are you doing this?

48:40.668 --> 48:42.945
Because I believed in you.

48:44.071 --> 48:45.381
You were gonna do great things.

48:45.423 --> 48:47.091
I am gonna do great things.

48:47.133 --> 48:50.720
No. Because you don't give
a shit about your community.

48:50.762 --> 48:53.222
How dare you say that to me.

48:54.265 --> 48:55.433
Who are you?

49:01.380 --> 49:03.799
My name is Marisol Silva.

49:04.901 --> 49:07.153
Now get the fuck out of my office.

49:32.053 --> 49:33.012
What happened?

49:33.054 --> 49:35.264
I was fired. Good luck.

49:51.030 --> 49:52.323
Hey, Frankie.

49:52.365 --> 49:54.409
Um, it's Denise again. Sorry.

49:54.450 --> 49:56.244
I just...

49:56.285 --> 50:00.748
Are you sure you haven't seen
my dad at the bar?

50:00.790 --> 50:02.166
Hey.

50:02.208 --> 50:03.459
- Hey.
- Did you hear from Billy yet?

50:03.501 --> 50:04.460
No.

50:04.502 --> 50:05.837
Yeah, he's not answering his phone.

50:05.878 --> 50:07.588
I'm sure he's upset about Julio.

50:07.630 --> 50:10.007
- It's so sad. That poor kid.
- Yeah.

50:10.049 --> 50:11.676
Listen, I need you
to go through all the incoming

50:11.718 --> 50:13.261
and outgoing numbers,
and I want you to keep calling

50:13.302 --> 50:14.262
until you get someone.

50:14.303 --> 50:15.972
- Okay?
- Okay. Whose phone is this?

50:16.013 --> 50:18.558
- That is Keith Roman's burner phone.
- Why do you have this?

50:18.599 --> 50:19.982
- Because I borrowed it.
- Because I borrowed it.

50:20.007 --> 50:21.018
- Okay?
- Borrowed?

50:21.060 --> 50:22.562
- That's right. That's what I did.
- Okay.

50:22.603 --> 50:24.363
So please do that. What is on my desk?

50:24.405 --> 50:26.566
Oh. Those are for Brittany.

50:26.607 --> 50:28.385
- She has a secret admirer.
- Mm-hmm?

50:28.426 --> 50:29.569
I read the card.

50:29.610 --> 50:31.154
Tom Wyatt.

50:31.887 --> 50:33.990
How is it a secret
if his name's on the card?

50:34.031 --> 50:35.992
- You know who that is, right?
- Don't give a fuck.

50:36.033 --> 50:37.910
- He's a billionaire.
- Get that shit off my desk.

50:37.952 --> 50:39.328
Not too shabby.

50:57.037 --> 50:58.931
I'm sorry I'm such a bummer today.

50:58.973 --> 51:01.017
Just...

51:01.058 --> 51:04.604
this whole thing about Julio.

51:04.645 --> 51:06.964
You don't have to apologize.

51:08.215 --> 51:10.485
I just can't believe he killed himself.

51:10.526 --> 51:12.178
He was about to get out.

51:14.054 --> 51:16.515
You never know what people are thinking.

51:19.869 --> 51:21.996
I just keep thinking about
how desperate he must've felt.

51:24.899 --> 51:27.460
'Cause I've had those thoughts.

51:29.003 --> 51:32.323
Like, I've wanted to do
bad things to myself.

51:34.158 --> 51:36.135
And-and I don't mean, like, abuse myself.

51:36.177 --> 51:37.786
I mean, like...

51:38.913 --> 51:40.706
end myself.

51:43.226 --> 51:44.602
Yeah.

51:44.644 --> 51:46.587
I've felt that loneliness.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.912
Hey.

52:06.440 --> 52:07.708
What's wrong?

52:07.750 --> 52:09.544
Mm.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.587
- Uh, no.
- Come on.

52:13.422 --> 52:15.216
It's okay.

52:15.258 --> 52:17.218
- Uh-uh. Mm-mm.
- It's okay.

52:17.260 --> 52:20.805
It's okay.

52:20.847 --> 52:22.348
It's okay, it's okay.

52:22.390 --> 52:24.083
Come here.

52:24.851 --> 52:26.686
Come here.

52:26.727 --> 52:29.188
It's all right.

52:34.026 --> 52:36.362
- Oh, I can't breathe.
- You're all right.

53:06.517 --> 53:08.394
Jesus.

53:08.436 --> 53:09.812
Wait, I know you.

53:13.065 --> 53:14.859
Leave town.

53:14.901 --> 53:16.819
Tell Senator Briggs you tripped.

53:23.826 --> 53:24.994
Hey, this is Billy.

53:25.036 --> 53:26.078
Leave a message.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.122
Hey, Dad. Um...

53:28.164 --> 53:29.624
I haven't heard from you,

53:29.665 --> 53:32.710
and I'm starting to get kind of worried.

53:32.752 --> 53:35.504
So, uh, just give me a call back.

53:35.546 --> 53:36.947
Love you.

54:00.947 --> 54:02.823
Okay.

54:04.784 --> 54:06.035
Okay.

54:06.077 --> 54:07.703
Goddamn it.

54:07.745 --> 54:09.355
That's not enough.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.375
Fuck. Fuck.

54:22.301 --> 54:24.053
Hey, this is Billy. Leave a message.

54:25.262 --> 54:26.889
Dad...

54:26.931 --> 54:29.642
Look, I know you, like,
fucking do this, or whatever,

54:29.684 --> 54:31.852
and you disappear, but...

54:31.894 --> 54:33.938
it's getting pretty messed up,
even for you.

54:33.980 --> 54:35.648
So...

54:35.690 --> 54:38.442
...just fucking call me.

54:38.484 --> 54:40.636
This is your daughter, Denise.

55:20.026 --> 55:20.985
Hey, this is Billy.

55:21.027 --> 55:22.403
Leave a message.

55:22.445 --> 55:24.363
And you know what?
Like, I fucking asked you.

55:24.405 --> 55:26.365
It was the one fucking thing I asked you.

55:26.407 --> 55:29.035
I said, "Please don't
screw it up with Marisol."

55:29.076 --> 55:33.456
I said please. That was
the one fucking thing, dude.

55:33.497 --> 55:35.416
And you just pushed her away.

55:35.458 --> 55:38.210
You fucking pushed her away,
just like you push me away.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.672
Just like you fucking push everyone away

55:41.714 --> 55:43.841
who cares about you.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.937
Danny!

55:56.979 --> 55:59.899
Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny.

55:59.940 --> 56:04.361
It appears as if you're trying
to make a run for it.

56:04.403 --> 56:06.572
Tom sent you.

56:06.614 --> 56:09.784
Well, we were hoping it wouldn't
come to this, Danny.

56:09.825 --> 56:11.327
He sent you 'cause he's a fucking coward.

56:11.368 --> 56:14.830
Well, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.

56:14.872 --> 56:16.290
Don't you think?

56:16.332 --> 56:18.334
And I debated, 'cause
I was thinking of using

56:18.375 --> 56:19.710
"people who live in glass houses

56:19.752 --> 56:21.337
shouldn't throw stones." I thought...

56:21.378 --> 56:23.631
Fuck you. Keith was my best friend.

56:23.672 --> 56:26.342
Well, there's your problem right there.

56:26.383 --> 56:29.095
You can't get emotionally
attached to these people, Danny.

56:29.136 --> 56:30.596
Stop fucking saying "Danny."

56:30.638 --> 56:33.849
Sorry... Daniel.

56:33.891 --> 56:36.352
I'm just, uh... just gonna miss you.

56:37.127 --> 56:38.938
Me, too.

56:46.070 --> 56:47.530
Fuck! Fuck!

56:47.571 --> 56:50.950
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

56:50.991 --> 56:52.868
Fuck! Fuck!

56:52.910 --> 56:54.954
You should have listened.

58:13.282 --> 58:14.850
Fuck.

58:15.534 --> 58:17.620
Jesus, this guy's car smells.

58:17.661 --> 58:19.288
Looks like he ate
every meal behind the wheel.

58:19.330 --> 58:21.373
It still smells better than your car.

58:21.415 --> 58:23.667
Fuck you.

58:33.636 --> 58:35.846
- Hello?
- Oh, hello!

58:35.888 --> 58:37.890
This is Marva Jefferson.

58:37.932 --> 58:40.935
I-I'm just so happy that
somebody finally answered.

58:40.976 --> 58:42.478
Who is this?

58:42.519 --> 58:44.605
Yeah, they found his ear
in the swimming pool.

58:44.647 --> 58:46.273
The rest of him on the sidewalk.

58:46.315 --> 58:47.900
- What?
- I know, right?

58:47.942 --> 58:49.068
It's messed up.

58:49.109 --> 58:50.653
What was his name?

58:50.694 --> 58:52.446
Daniel Loomis.

58:52.488 --> 58:53.948
He was a member here.

58:53.989 --> 58:55.491
You know anything about him?

58:55.532 --> 58:58.035
Nah. But he was a good tipper.

58:58.077 --> 59:00.871
It's too bad it wasn't
his friend who got killed.

59:00.913 --> 59:02.373
That guy was such a prick.

59:02.414 --> 59:03.958
Who was his friend?

59:03.999 --> 59:05.542
I don't know.

59:05.584 --> 59:07.152
But he's outside on the bench.

59:11.799 --> 59:14.718
Hey. Uh, do you know a Roman?

59:14.760 --> 59:16.845
I'm so glad you asked.

59:17.329 --> 59:20.057
I know many Romans...

59:20.099 --> 59:22.042
and Greeks...

59:23.352 --> 59:27.481
and Turks, and Genghis fucking Khan

59:27.523 --> 59:29.984
was my best fucking friend.

59:30.025 --> 59:31.527
Thank you.

59:37.616 --> 59:40.119
Huh.

59:44.707 --> 59:48.043
No. I can't. No.

59:50.462 --> 59:53.257
Goddamn it.

59:55.134 --> 59:57.594
Yes.

59:57.636 --> 59:59.722
Oh, hi.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.084
So where is he?

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:06.895
What?!

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:23.829
All right, that's him.

01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.664
You stay here.

01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:42.681
Fernando Venezuela.

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:44.350
That wasn't...

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:45.893
Um...

01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:49.646
Va-Vasquez. Fernando Vasquez.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:51.398
Fuck.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.567
Fernan... Vacuum. Fernando Vac...

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:54.943
I don't fucking know. Um...

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.653
JT told me to give you this.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:57.946
- That's close enough.
- Okay.

01:01:00.682 --> 01:01:02.659
It's Fernando Valenzuela.

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.203
Fuck. Thank you. That's...

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:06.580
That makes sense.

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:19.968
Goddamn, son of a bitch.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.637
Damn it.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.180
Little help, man?

01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:25.599
Jesus.

01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:28.251
All right. Thanks, bud.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.837
Oh, fuck.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:34.608
- Dad.
- Oh, hey, honey.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.318
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.779
Oh, don't-don't-don't worry about it.

01:01:38.821 --> 01:01:40.697
- Everything's okay, sweetie.
- Are you okay?

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.991
Yeah. It looks worse than it is.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.410
Jesus.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.746
Shit.

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:49.456
Please give me a fucking cigarette.

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:51.108
Yeah. Okay.

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:54.420
- What the hell happened?
- I'll tell you

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:55.712
the whole thing on our way, all right?

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.297
Okay.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:59.550
I'll light it. I'll light it.

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:02.447
Shit. My hands are shaking. I can't...

01:02:02.496 --> 01:02:04.167
Let's just get in the fucking car.
Come on.

01:02:04.209 --> 01:02:05.889
Oh, you know what? Let me drive.

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:07.391
No, no. I got it. I can drive.

01:02:07.433 --> 01:02:08.851
No, no. We need to get somewhere.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.352
Wh... That wasn't nice.

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.688
That wasn't a nice thing to say.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.857
How do you crank this fucking thing up?

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.567
With the key. You do it with the key.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.820
- Okay.
- Smart-ass.

01:02:19.862 --> 01:02:22.156
In. Then you press that.

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:24.158
Put your seat belt on.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.243
Put your seat belt on.

01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:28.036
Lights on. You have to put the lights on.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.288
I'm trying, I'm trying.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.331
Put the... put your lights on!
