00:03.006 --> 00:05.070
- Fuck!
- Oh, gross!

00:05.164 --> 00:06.851
Alena, Laura.

00:06.976 --> 00:08.890
Oh, you're Casey's girlfriend. Hi.

00:09.031 --> 00:10.072
Her wife.

00:10.148 --> 00:11.533
How is this gonna work?

00:11.703 --> 00:15.429
We're waiting, 'cause I want...
I want the sex to be about us.

00:15.609 --> 00:18.757
Hello, why are you giving
my nine-year-old a music sermon?

00:18.914 --> 00:20.961
We're trying to find
Alex's sister's dad.

00:21.156 --> 00:22.334
Good news and bad news.

00:22.461 --> 00:25.137
Bad news: your biological dad
is no longer with us.

00:25.211 --> 00:27.484
Good news: I found your half-brother.

00:27.609 --> 00:28.895
And he's in Fresno.

00:29.140 --> 00:30.812
This is my thing!

00:30.929 --> 00:34.828
Mine, and you can't just
fucking insert yourself.

00:35.101 --> 00:36.260
I was like you.

00:36.351 --> 00:37.914
And then I meet this woman

00:37.978 --> 00:40.523
who suddenly treats me
like I have something to offer.

00:40.617 --> 00:42.625
And then like the sun, she sets on you,

00:42.709 --> 00:44.476
shines on someone else.

00:45.218 --> 00:46.471
Wow.

00:46.573 --> 00:49.160
If you just had feelings for her,
you should have told me.

00:49.318 --> 00:50.904
I don't have feelings for Valerie.

00:51.023 --> 00:53.742
You can never be anyone's second choice.

00:53.867 --> 00:55.867
I just wasn't sure
if I could be your first choice.

00:55.984 --> 00:59.398
But you could. I mean, you are.

- Hi.
- Hi.

01:28.669 --> 01:30.630
- Come in.
- Sure.

01:32.151 --> 01:33.328
Well, this is it.

01:33.422 --> 01:34.819
- This is it.

01:41.513 --> 01:42.974
Chris Christie?

01:43.747 --> 01:46.521
Um, that guy is at least 50,

01:46.669 --> 01:48.982
and fat don't crack.

01:49.169 --> 01:50.265
And John Wayne.

01:50.357 --> 01:53.482
Nah, it's not... not Mom's type.

01:56.023 --> 01:57.249
Oh.

01:59.857 --> 02:01.325
Whew.

02:01.809 --> 02:02.927
Thank Christ.

02:03.091 --> 02:04.938
My first reaction was illegal,

02:05.024 --> 02:06.543
technically, in most states.

02:06.630 --> 02:08.247
Uh, Valerie?

02:09.348 --> 02:10.466
Rich.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.054
- That's me.
- Yeah.

02:12.224 --> 02:13.357
Uh...

02:13.479 --> 02:16.647
- Hi, I'm Jack.
- Oh, hey.

02:16.695 --> 02:17.821
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:17.943 --> 02:20.310
Jack. Okay.

02:24.108 --> 02:25.943
Take you long to get here from LA?

02:26.302 --> 02:27.825
- Um...
- Oh, three hours.

02:27.935 --> 02:29.710
- Yeah.
- Oh, fast.

02:29.927 --> 02:31.271
What kind of car you drive?

02:31.349 --> 02:32.511
- A Prius.
- An Audi SUV.

02:32.613 --> 02:34.879
- Her...
- Uh, Jack drove.

02:35.935 --> 02:37.736
I had a Honda SUV once.

02:37.974 --> 02:40.489
It was great for going to the drive-in.
You remember drive-ins?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.677
Yeah, I sure do.

02:43.903 --> 02:47.672
I saw "X-Men: Days of Future Past"
at the Madera drive-in.

02:48.071 --> 02:49.333
You see that one?

02:49.591 --> 02:50.991
Um, they...

02:51.069 --> 02:53.036
they go back in time or something?

02:53.255 --> 02:55.384
Back and forward.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.919
Right. Wow.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.860
Sounds confusing,
but it makes sense when you see it.

03:01.071 --> 03:03.560
All the science is based on real stuff.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.403
Mm.

03:07.691 --> 03:09.179
Man.

03:09.743 --> 03:11.092
You go your whole life and never knowing

03:11.139 --> 03:13.514
your dad had an affair
and had another kid.

03:14.489 --> 03:16.247
What a trip.

03:16.635 --> 03:18.263
Yeah.

03:21.161 --> 03:23.833
- You guys hungry?
- Yeah.

03:23.949 --> 03:25.996
What's... what's good here?

03:29.900 --> 03:31.614
He's been listening to my mix.

03:31.743 --> 03:34.107
You couldn't have
introduced him to jazz?

03:34.302 --> 03:36.755
He's too young to fall on that sword.

03:37.110 --> 03:39.255
Oh, no, is that your lunch?

03:39.559 --> 03:41.040
- Yes.
- No.

03:41.097 --> 03:42.517
It was also my dinner

03:42.629 --> 03:44.278
and then a lunch before that.

03:44.366 --> 03:45.513
No.

03:45.678 --> 03:47.183
Here.

03:48.724 --> 03:49.963
- Really?
- Yes.

03:50.060 --> 03:51.419
That looks really good.

03:51.513 --> 03:52.896
- It is.
- Thank you.

03:52.988 --> 03:55.825
You know, if you ever wanted
a regionally specific meal

03:56.073 --> 03:58.672
prepared by a trained professional chef

03:58.744 --> 04:01.997
or even a whole sandwich,
I could take you out.

04:03.018 --> 04:04.903
That would make for good office gossip.

04:05.028 --> 04:07.822
I could cook too,
if you want something more private.

04:09.504 --> 04:10.784
Oh.

04:11.766 --> 04:14.802
That's thoughtful, but no, right?

04:14.918 --> 04:17.528
HR would rake me over the coals.

04:17.886 --> 04:20.536
- Aren't you HR?
- Oh.

04:21.824 --> 04:23.661
Thanks for lunch.

04:28.192 --> 04:31.365
So Kitty Pride has to keep the link up

04:31.475 --> 04:33.452
while mutants die in the future,

04:33.552 --> 04:36.476
fighting to give Wolverine
a chance to save the past.

04:36.937 --> 04:39.958
Wolverine, that's Hugh Jackman, right?

04:40.076 --> 04:41.031
Uh-huh.

04:41.088 --> 04:43.688
Yeah, I like him.
He can sing. He's Australian.

04:43.899 --> 04:45.317
But not racist Australian.

04:45.381 --> 04:47.593
- Mel Gibson Australian. Yeah.
- Exactly.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.521
Anyway, then the Sentinels show up,

04:52.690 --> 04:54.359
and it is not pretty.

04:54.542 --> 04:57.333
They say robots are gonna
take over the world one day,

04:58.091 --> 05:00.029
but I hope it's not these robots.

05:01.133 --> 05:02.841
Yeah, me too.

05:02.946 --> 05:04.493
Oh, you'd be safe.

05:04.587 --> 05:07.062
They could never take the place
of a psychiatrist.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.606
Oh, I don't know about that.

05:08.710 --> 05:11.794
"Siri, why do I want to kill my mother
and fuck my father?"

05:14.232 --> 05:16.263
I'm sorry. That was...

05:16.364 --> 05:18.083
- No, it's a...
- Sorry about that.

05:18.140 --> 05:20.427
I... I'd be safe too.

05:20.747 --> 05:22.560
Butchering, that's an art form.

05:22.700 --> 05:25.168
- Yeah.
- Yeah, slaughtering, bleeding, skinning...

05:25.216 --> 05:26.930
you know, it's all in the feel.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.130
They have robots
that can debone a chicken,

05:29.184 --> 05:32.427
but... a chicken
is not a cow.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.586
No, it is not.

05:34.657 --> 05:37.724
- It's really not even close, yeah.
- Thank you.

05:39.388 --> 05:41.370
Well, Rich,

05:41.529 --> 05:43.880
this has been, um...

05:44.216 --> 05:46.943
so just really good meeting you.

05:47.090 --> 05:48.271
Really good.

05:48.396 --> 05:50.567
But I think we need to be heading back.

05:50.614 --> 05:53.302
I have a class tonight,
and Jack has to work.

05:53.373 --> 05:54.959
But this has just been really nice.

05:55.108 --> 05:56.526
You're leaving?

05:56.919 --> 05:58.708
I took the early shift tomorrow.

05:58.777 --> 06:01.623
I thought maybe you could
come over for dinner,

06:02.155 --> 06:03.670
meet the family,

06:03.936 --> 06:05.528
maybe hear a little bit about Dad.

06:06.164 --> 06:08.193
Oh, yeah, no, I...

06:08.310 --> 06:10.232
Yeah, yeah,
we can make that work, right?

06:10.497 --> 06:11.802
I'd love it.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.276
Really.

06:15.604 --> 06:16.772
Oh, of course.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.614
Yeah, of course.

06:18.902 --> 06:20.613
I would love it too.

06:25.981 --> 06:28.986
What's a five-letter word
for "redolence"?

06:29.159 --> 06:30.542
Starts with "A"?

06:30.661 --> 06:32.286
Uh...

06:33.877 --> 06:35.341
"Aroma."

06:35.961 --> 06:38.653
Ah! That's it!

06:38.859 --> 06:41.318
My first Thursday puzzle.

06:41.523 --> 06:43.208
Glass of wine to celebrate?

06:43.452 --> 06:45.404
Day drinking makes me sleepy.

06:45.544 --> 06:48.749
Hmm, well, then sleep...

06:49.325 --> 06:51.079
we shall.

06:56.441 --> 06:58.066
You didn't have to cook for me.

06:58.194 --> 06:59.433
I know.

06:59.558 --> 07:01.894
But your kitchen is so much
better than the co-op.

07:02.176 --> 07:03.800
Here, chop that.

07:07.345 --> 07:10.238
So where'd you learn the culinary arts?

07:10.407 --> 07:11.878
Howard Dean campaign.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.454
I was your age, actually.

07:13.455 --> 07:15.430
Freezing in New Hampshire.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.373
You learn quick when you're desperate.

07:17.589 --> 07:19.320
Sounds fun.

07:19.729 --> 07:21.393
Until the scream.

07:21.527 --> 07:24.100
After that, I quit party politics
and went grassroots.

07:24.183 --> 07:26.667
- Ah, yes, the small-time.
- Yeah.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.818
Federal government's fucked,

07:29.191 --> 07:31.321
and low expectations is all we got.

07:31.495 --> 07:35.326
Okay, so you're cautiously pessimistic
about the council meeting?

07:35.495 --> 07:36.660
I don't know.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.277
I mean, Beverly Hills did it.

07:38.387 --> 07:40.223
Permanent moratorium,
no more oil drilling.

07:40.367 --> 07:43.862
Yeah, if only we had a better argument
than community health.

07:43.975 --> 07:47.866
Yeah, health does not finance
re-election campaigns.

07:48.649 --> 07:50.612
So you're going to speak at the meeting?

07:52.093 --> 07:53.263
Should I?

07:53.344 --> 07:55.287
Maybe. Isn't that why you took this job?

07:56.917 --> 07:58.795
Well, I took it 'cause you asked.

07:59.748 --> 08:01.753
Well, don't say that.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.546
Hey, can I talk to you?

08:21.105 --> 08:23.066
If we just... if we let it go,

08:23.152 --> 08:24.833
it'll shock you
how much it never happened.

08:24.973 --> 08:27.435
No, don't quote "Mad Men" to me.

08:27.679 --> 08:29.272
And this isn't about you.

08:31.355 --> 08:32.683
Is something wrong with me?

08:32.784 --> 08:34.885
- Yes.
- No, seriously.

08:35.089 --> 08:36.701
I just got turned down for a date.

08:37.145 --> 08:38.741
You really want to know?

08:38.947 --> 08:40.207
Hit me.

08:40.455 --> 08:42.274
You're selfish, man.

08:42.416 --> 08:44.712
Like, epically selfish.

08:44.895 --> 08:47.788
You're like textbook example
of a narcissist.

08:48.019 --> 08:51.469
And you're a man-child.
You're manipulative.

08:51.692 --> 08:53.226
And you want to be good, right?

08:53.423 --> 08:56.157
That ideal appeals to you.
It feels good.

08:56.243 --> 08:58.454
But in practice, it's too much work.

08:58.685 --> 09:00.805
You know what? You should
just play to your strengths.

09:00.927 --> 09:03.423
You got a kind of creepy charm.

09:03.548 --> 09:05.553
You know, you have
this full head of hair,

09:05.657 --> 09:07.837
- got a great house.
- It is pretty great.

09:07.997 --> 09:10.224
You've got symmetrical facial features.

09:10.314 --> 09:12.485
- You're 6 feet tall.
- I'm 6'1".

09:12.562 --> 09:13.814
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.380
Oh.

09:16.168 --> 09:18.255
Okay, anything else?

09:18.601 --> 09:20.177
You'll be fine.

09:21.813 --> 09:23.220
- Oh.
- What?

09:23.431 --> 09:24.757
Good news.

09:24.915 --> 09:26.303
I bought some toenail clippers.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.462
I'm going. I'm gone.

09:31.173 --> 09:33.758
So your mom lets you
stay here by yourself?

09:34.110 --> 09:36.445
I mean, I could hang out
at my dad's, but...

09:36.751 --> 09:38.650
Mae-Yi tried giving me dating advice,

09:38.745 --> 09:40.587
and I thought she was kidding,
so I laughed,

09:40.673 --> 09:44.312
but it turns out she was serious,
and now things are strained.

09:44.799 --> 09:46.259
Who's Mae-Yi?

09:46.664 --> 09:49.775
The 23-year-old I walked in
on my dad having sex with.

09:51.735 --> 09:53.496
And you're the one
that had to tell your mom?

09:53.665 --> 09:57.400
After a week of careful deliberation.

09:58.048 --> 09:59.702
Not an easy conversation.

09:59.703 --> 10:01.577
Nope.

10:01.931 --> 10:03.501
And she's still sad.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.814
They both are.

10:06.290 --> 10:07.876
Could have saved a lot in lawyer fees

10:07.939 --> 10:09.807
if they'd just accepted their fate.

10:10.668 --> 10:12.605
You believe in fate?

10:13.532 --> 10:16.762
Well, we're the products
of the people who raised us, right?

10:17.641 --> 10:19.398
My people are fucked.

10:19.576 --> 10:21.017
QED.

10:21.831 --> 10:24.042
In a year, you're gonna leave home

10:24.169 --> 10:26.172
and make so many mistakes

10:26.476 --> 10:28.368
that have nothing to do
with your parents.

10:28.599 --> 10:30.197
So don't fall back on that shit,

10:30.362 --> 10:32.743
'cause it's easy, and it's obvious.

10:49.584 --> 10:50.927
I know.

10:51.642 --> 10:53.418
I'm thinking about it too.

10:53.997 --> 10:58.669
How did the X-Men go backwards
and forwards in time?

10:58.966 --> 11:01.709
Look, that science
is all based on real stuff.

11:01.943 --> 11:03.318
I get the feeling that

11:03.374 --> 11:05.461
first impressions aren't his specialty.

11:05.621 --> 11:08.794
Well, he's a butcher who works at Vons

11:08.842 --> 11:10.762
and lives vicariously
through superheroes.

11:10.841 --> 11:12.287
What else is there to say?

11:12.427 --> 11:14.294
Come on. This is exciting.

11:14.498 --> 11:15.640
The Big Tomato.

11:15.688 --> 11:17.227
Oh, well, that's Sacramento.

11:17.275 --> 11:18.332
- Really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

11:18.380 --> 11:19.702
- We're not in the Big Tomato right now?
<i>- No.</i>

11:19.749 --> 11:21.377
Oh, fuck it, then.

11:21.696 --> 11:23.336
We should bring something
tomorrow, right?

11:23.397 --> 11:25.471
Like a cake or a pie?

11:25.559 --> 11:27.232
Pie. Pie is good.

11:27.662 --> 11:30.101
Yeah, pie's really great.

11:31.452 --> 11:32.966
You okay?

11:34.428 --> 11:37.499
It's just not
what I thought it would be.

11:37.761 --> 11:40.232
It's just one dinner. Don't sweat it.

11:40.326 --> 11:42.802
I'm gonna be there
right next to you the whole time.

11:43.336 --> 11:46.713
Yeah, that's not what I...
what I'm talking about.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.513
This'll be good. You'll see.

11:50.968 --> 11:52.164
Yeah.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.063
Right. Okay.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.630
Um, good night, Jack.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.693
Good night.

12:20.776 --> 12:22.120
Casey?

12:24.099 --> 12:25.361
Yeah?

12:25.620 --> 12:27.353
Um, I don't...

12:27.768 --> 12:29.893
I don't want to speak
at the council meeting.

12:30.658 --> 12:34.130
I don't have anything
important enough to say.

12:34.552 --> 12:35.834
That's fine.

12:35.945 --> 12:37.529
You don't have to.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.079
You won't be disappointed?

12:41.229 --> 12:42.709
It's not about me.

12:42.916 --> 12:44.415
It's about you.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.952
You want to sleep here?

13:16.762 --> 13:17.950
- Saya...
- I'm sorry.

13:18.015 --> 13:20.372
She refuses to photograph
in a Spanish-style house

13:20.504 --> 13:22.161
until the Catalan situation is resolved.

13:22.247 --> 13:24.020
The house we rented is Mediterranean.

13:24.112 --> 13:26.562
- She says it's the same thing.
- Motherfucking Gia.

13:26.742 --> 13:28.328
Who's Gia?

13:28.472 --> 13:30.099
She's a YouTuber.

13:30.195 --> 13:32.711
She's massively popular and awful.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.766
She's from Spain?

13:35.024 --> 13:37.348
- Long Beach.
- Right.

13:37.514 --> 13:39.225
We're launching her lifestyle brand...

13:39.273 --> 13:40.938
adult dinner party, adult house.

13:41.105 --> 13:42.775
She's very particular.

13:44.467 --> 13:46.051
Use my house.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.801
You own a house?

13:48.545 --> 13:50.543
Da bones are great.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.100
Light's fantastic.

13:54.614 --> 13:56.153
This place was made to be shot.

13:56.323 --> 13:59.121
You are a freaking lifesaver. I owe you.

13:59.363 --> 14:00.676
Yeah, no problem.

14:00.785 --> 14:03.153
So what do we do now,
just hang around till Gia shows up?

14:03.230 --> 14:05.301
Sadly, I have to get back to the office.

14:05.402 --> 14:08.074
But Saya will be here to troubleshoot.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.428
Yay.

14:23.355 --> 14:25.357
Oh, my God, Leon.

14:25.578 --> 14:27.846
The inside is like custard.

14:28.073 --> 14:29.637
And the syrup...

14:29.952 --> 14:33.371
Well, it's just leftover wine,
blueberries, and sugar.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.096
Wait. You made this?

14:36.346 --> 14:37.824
Well, yeah, you...

14:37.983 --> 14:39.721
you said you like blueberries.

14:41.861 --> 14:44.557
What did I do to deserve you?

14:45.936 --> 14:47.555
I... I should get going.

14:48.151 --> 14:50.409
I hear the siren's call of the cafe.

14:50.573 --> 14:53.206
Oh, you're still working
at the coffee shop?

14:53.432 --> 14:57.120
Um, until they finish
construction at my flat,

14:57.346 --> 15:00.409
which, at this rate, will be never.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.448
Um, well, Val's still away. Why don't...

15:05.084 --> 15:08.498
you stay and do some work here?

15:08.570 --> 15:11.761
Or other things.

15:12.948 --> 15:14.643
Friday crossword?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.417
Maybe later.

15:22.330 --> 15:26.042
I can't tell if these cornflakes
are stale or just cornflakes.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.745
It looks like a big bowl of scabs.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.979
Sorry.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.714
Why do people sentimentalize
small towns? Why?

15:36.822 --> 15:39.362
I mean, is uniformity so endearing?

15:39.507 --> 15:42.220
Like, "Oh, I don't have to hear
other points of view.

15:42.307 --> 15:43.767
How great."

15:43.846 --> 15:45.088
Fresno's not that small, miss.

15:45.190 --> 15:47.110
It's the almond capital of the world.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.768
That's Sacramento.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.737
- That's Sacramento? Shit. Damn it.
- Yeah.

15:53.819 --> 15:57.206
All right, I got to take this.
I'm sorry. One second.

15:58.273 --> 16:00.068
Yeah.

16:11.321 --> 16:13.173
Okay, so this is terrible timing,

16:13.221 --> 16:14.449
but this work thing just came up.

16:14.496 --> 16:16.706
I have to take this. Couple hours.

16:17.034 --> 16:18.321
What?

16:18.370 --> 16:19.784
- A couple hours?
- At the most.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.370
- I think it'll be... it'll be less, no.
- What I am supposed to do?

16:23.455 --> 16:24.956
Here, get the pie.

16:25.039 --> 16:26.581
And I'll be as fast as I can; I promise.

16:26.628 --> 16:28.005
Sorry.

16:30.898 --> 16:32.518
Yeah.

16:39.426 --> 16:41.691
You know, eye contact. Keep it personal.

16:41.816 --> 16:43.886
Short and sweet. They will cut you off.

16:44.426 --> 16:46.370
And just hey, no pressure.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.699
Say what you have to say.
It's on them to listen.

16:48.894 --> 16:50.296
Hello?

16:50.355 --> 16:52.738
<i>Hey, you ever heard
of the YouTube star Gia?</i>

16:52.840 --> 16:54.444
The one who flashed
her tits at the Broad?

16:54.491 --> 16:57.253
Yeah, and she has
terrible taste in art, for one.

16:57.332 --> 16:58.496
<i>Stop the presses.</i>

16:58.582 --> 17:00.882
Hey, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

17:01.003 --> 17:03.550
She just mixes random black textiles.

17:03.636 --> 17:05.300
That's not design;
that's an affront to good taste.

17:05.348 --> 17:06.829
Excuse me.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.847
Do you care about anything important?

17:09.257 --> 17:11.152
Have you not heard my tone?

17:14.394 --> 17:16.282
Do you think our family's poisoned?

17:16.432 --> 17:18.527
What do you mean? In what way?

17:18.723 --> 17:21.798
Like, in our blood?

17:22.454 --> 17:25.207
Because there's something wrong with us
that can never be fixed?

17:25.587 --> 17:28.525
Yes. I mean, I can only speak for myself.

17:28.642 --> 17:29.726
Maybe ask your mom?

17:30.306 --> 17:32.035
She's in Fresno.

17:34.892 --> 17:36.176
Oh.

17:36.809 --> 17:39.247
I got to go. Good luck with Gia.

17:41.683 --> 17:44.042
I'll call him and see
if he can take the hit.

17:44.299 --> 17:46.302
And I'll also call Suarez.

17:46.652 --> 17:49.143
He said he'd help
with gap financing, and we...

17:49.651 --> 17:50.746
Right.

17:50.933 --> 17:54.402
Yeah, no, we have options.
Just tell me what you need.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.478
Hey, Logan.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.127
<i>Are you okay?</i>

18:01.906 --> 18:03.463
<i>You're here.</i>

18:04.192 --> 18:06.177
<i>Where else would I be?</i>

18:11.726 --> 18:14.116
I've lived in West Adams for 20 years,

18:14.382 --> 18:16.788
and because I hope to do so
for another 20,

18:17.280 --> 18:21.061
I ask that the council vote yes
on the moratorium.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.603
Thank you.

18:22.714 --> 18:24.882
I believe we have one more speaker.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.154
Excuse me.

18:30.566 --> 18:31.968
Thank you.

18:35.062 --> 18:36.618
Hello.

18:37.096 --> 18:39.432
So I'm only 17 now,

18:39.575 --> 18:43.210
but I will be able to vote
in the next election...

18:44.396 --> 18:46.227
or, since I don't see
any women up there,

18:46.280 --> 18:47.757
maybe even run.

18:49.945 --> 18:51.484
Um...

18:51.954 --> 18:53.847
Okay, so...

18:54.732 --> 18:57.404
there are active oil and gas wells

18:57.467 --> 18:58.803
all over the city,

18:58.892 --> 19:03.138
most within 2,000 feet
of homes and schools

19:03.267 --> 19:05.064
and hospitals.

19:05.470 --> 19:08.990
Only drilling companies
cover them up with buildings

19:09.111 --> 19:12.571
so people don't know what's happening
right next to them.

19:13.273 --> 19:14.890
But you do.

19:15.349 --> 19:20.966
There are 400 cases of
nosebleeds and other symptoms,

19:21.045 --> 19:23.974
and there's something toxic in the air

19:24.515 --> 19:26.809
that no one wants to talk about,

19:27.763 --> 19:32.054
I guess 'cause it's hard.

19:33.208 --> 19:36.044
But shouldn't we talk
about the hard things the most

19:36.468 --> 19:39.427
instead of just sweeping them
under the rug

19:39.487 --> 19:43.573
and letting the poison seep inside us?

19:45.183 --> 19:47.222
You know, 'cause once it's there,

19:47.892 --> 19:49.471
it affects everyone.

19:49.861 --> 19:52.148
And maybe you can never get it out.

19:53.763 --> 19:57.100
I just think you're making
my generation pay the price,

19:57.888 --> 19:59.416
and you look the other way,

19:59.464 --> 20:02.459
hoping that everything's
going to be okay.

20:03.451 --> 20:05.289
But it won't be okay.

20:06.729 --> 20:08.558
And that's...

20:09.910 --> 20:11.589
really, really sad

20:12.137 --> 20:13.532
and unfair.

20:15.017 --> 20:17.158
Please vote yes on the moratorium.

20:17.446 --> 20:19.326
Thank you.

20:21.115 --> 20:23.263
Excuse me. Thank you.

20:24.568 --> 20:26.849
- This one?
- I guess so.

20:27.263 --> 20:28.960
What happened to our pie idea?

20:29.263 --> 20:32.935
Oh, they were... totally out of pie.

20:34.933 --> 20:37.236
- Get in here.
- Hi.

20:37.698 --> 20:39.040
We brought champagne.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.276
Ooh.

20:40.468 --> 20:43.019
- This is my wife, Wendy. She's a nurse.
- Hi.

20:43.270 --> 20:44.409
And my son, Jamey.

20:44.457 --> 20:46.175
- He's at UC Davis.
- Oh, cool.

20:46.292 --> 20:49.433
This is my... Jack.

20:51.179 --> 20:53.117
Would you like something to drink?

20:54.026 --> 20:55.445
Champagne?

20:56.632 --> 20:58.901
- Yeah.
- Okay. Thank you.

21:01.314 --> 21:04.118
In the cut-off jean shorts,

21:04.301 --> 21:06.048
that's our Great Uncle Virgil.

21:06.290 --> 21:08.610
He was a bit of a ladies' man
back in his day.

21:08.692 --> 21:10.595
Uh-oh. He looks the part.

21:11.891 --> 21:15.282
So what are you studying at UC Davis?

21:15.532 --> 21:16.970
Animal sciences.

21:17.154 --> 21:18.769
Yeah, Dad taught me a lot
about livestock,

21:18.816 --> 21:22.209
and I'd like to see sustainable
farming embraced by the big players.

21:22.681 --> 21:24.321
This is a picture of me and Dad

21:24.496 --> 21:26.746
on a fishing trip when I was ten.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.415
He was a big fly fisherman,
made all his own flies.

21:31.770 --> 21:33.095
He tried to teach me,

21:33.210 --> 21:35.755
but no one was ever as good
at it as he was.

21:36.071 --> 21:38.265
He was never happier
than when he was fishing.

21:39.318 --> 21:42.196
- Do you like baseball?
- I do. What you got?

21:42.962 --> 21:45.294
- This bad boy...
- Oh, wow.

22:08.154 --> 22:09.341
Hey.

22:11.465 --> 22:13.154
My God.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.247
You know, it's actually kind of funny,

22:16.295 --> 22:19.263
because your identity
is so tied to this house,

22:19.364 --> 22:21.232
and it's, like, basically
getting torn apart,

22:21.310 --> 22:24.278
which is probably how you feel
after getting rejected again.

22:24.771 --> 22:26.654
Don't let them touch my shit.

22:49.544 --> 22:51.340
Enough!

22:59.213 --> 23:01.253
Do you want to talk about it?

23:01.755 --> 23:03.595
It's fine. I'm fine.

23:04.495 --> 23:06.525
I'll buy you a new waffle iron.

23:06.877 --> 23:08.385
I liked that one.

23:10.995 --> 23:13.158
I'm disappointed you didn't
want to go out with me.

23:13.399 --> 23:15.869
I mean, I respect your decision, but...

23:17.089 --> 23:18.425
I thought we vibed.

23:19.285 --> 23:20.572
Oh.

23:20.736 --> 23:23.955
I clearly misunderstood the situation,
and it's frustrating.

23:24.314 --> 23:26.554
I mean, you know
I'm still married, right?

23:27.494 --> 23:29.064
I mean, separated.

23:29.147 --> 23:32.702
But technically, yeah.

23:35.999 --> 23:39.252
Can we maybe not have
this conversation here?

23:44.405 --> 23:46.037
Fine.

23:49.877 --> 23:52.095
- Thank you. This is a great pie.
- Um hm.

23:52.189 --> 23:54.381
It was my mom's recipe,
and she passed it down.

23:54.546 --> 23:56.602
Wow, that's so nice.

23:56.827 --> 23:59.633
I can't imagine the horrors
that my mom passed down to me.

23:59.752 --> 24:01.462
I mean, genetically speaking.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.119
She didn't... she didn't bake
too many pies.

24:05.518 --> 24:06.932
But yeah.

24:07.158 --> 24:08.720
Does anybody else want...

24:08.776 --> 24:10.236
Really? Nobody?

24:10.330 --> 24:11.947
Want some? Anybody?

24:12.075 --> 24:14.572
- Jamey?
- I'm 20.

24:14.853 --> 24:17.931
Okay, well, don't say I didn't offer.

24:18.422 --> 24:21.119
- Is it okay if I head to Josh's now?
- Yeah, it's fine.

24:21.228 --> 24:22.370
It was nice to meet you guys.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.447
- Oh.
- You too.

24:23.495 --> 24:24.618
Good night, then.

24:29.421 --> 24:32.713
So... UC Davis.

24:32.861 --> 24:34.236
We could never afford it,

24:34.284 --> 24:38.053
but... he knew what he wanted,
and he hit the books,

24:38.292 --> 24:39.837
got himself a scholarship.

24:39.975 --> 24:41.310
Awesome.

24:42.111 --> 24:43.845
Rich tells me you have a daughter.

24:43.966 --> 24:47.779
Yeah, Laura.
She's 17. She's homeschooled.

24:48.146 --> 24:51.522
Not by me, by qualified people.

24:52.006 --> 24:53.374
She's very smart.

24:54.241 --> 24:56.035
You must be so proud.

24:56.295 --> 24:58.077
What's that? Oh.

24:58.772 --> 25:00.393
I'm not her father.

25:00.502 --> 25:01.881
Yeah, I'm divorced.

25:02.525 --> 25:04.182
Oh.

25:04.612 --> 25:06.240
I'm so sorry.

25:06.830 --> 25:08.791
No, it's good.

25:09.587 --> 25:11.299
It's an improvement.

25:12.166 --> 25:13.487
Was it hard on Laura?

25:13.695 --> 25:15.491
Actually, she thrived.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.914
Is she in LA with her dad?

25:18.122 --> 25:20.728
Um, yeah. Sure. Or she's at home.

25:20.791 --> 25:23.494
You know, she's very...
she's very independent.

25:26.300 --> 25:27.978
And there's a landlady next door,

25:28.106 --> 25:30.767
so, you know... just in case.

25:32.128 --> 25:34.073
Well...

25:34.463 --> 25:36.223
If that's what works for you.

25:36.791 --> 25:38.291
Yeah, it does.

25:38.987 --> 25:40.415
Man.

25:40.575 --> 25:42.549
Sounds tough, life in the big city.

25:42.657 --> 25:46.322
- I don't know how you do it.
- Well, you know...

25:46.564 --> 25:48.205
it could be worse.

25:48.477 --> 25:50.213
Could be in Fresno, right?

25:52.978 --> 25:54.193
I'm...

25:54.454 --> 25:56.587
I'm kidding. It's great.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.992
Mostly, I just feel stupid.

26:07.257 --> 26:09.890
I know I should move on. He did.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.317
It's hard.

26:13.686 --> 26:15.904
You have a person who's your stability,

26:16.011 --> 26:17.961
and then suddenly they just leave.

26:18.105 --> 26:19.710
You can't lean on them anymore.

26:19.831 --> 26:22.618
And then you think
you've moved on and you're fine,

26:22.666 --> 26:24.050
but then you see a picture of them

26:24.129 --> 26:26.358
or have some memory, and you realize

26:26.383 --> 26:28.253
you're not fine at all.

26:30.935 --> 26:32.820
Gia's not coming.

26:33.312 --> 26:35.101
Motherfucking Gia.

26:37.990 --> 26:39.920
What a waste of food.

26:51.387 --> 26:52.830
Good work up there.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.673
Oh, stop.

26:56.117 --> 26:57.432
You're not poison.

26:57.508 --> 26:58.924
You know that, right?

27:02.562 --> 27:03.950
Casey.

27:04.105 --> 27:06.219
Pete Nako has office space
in Sacramento.

27:06.361 --> 27:07.561
Can you take a look on Friday?

27:07.615 --> 27:09.629
Awesome, yeah.
No, I'm driving up Thursday anyway,

27:09.677 --> 27:11.211
so it's perfect.

27:13.028 --> 27:15.752
- What's in Sacramento?
- The next battle.

27:16.299 --> 27:17.713
But what about here?

27:18.002 --> 27:20.032
I mean, we have the support
of the city council now,

27:20.033 --> 27:21.174
and you'll be here.

27:21.319 --> 27:23.182
You can help lead the resistance.

27:23.479 --> 27:25.112
Ask Nako what he wants us to bring.

27:25.191 --> 27:27.338
Like, is the printer here
rental, or do we own it?

27:27.429 --> 27:29.260
- Will do.
- Thanks, Katrina.

27:29.666 --> 27:31.179
Oh, shit, he's calling me now.

27:31.322 --> 27:33.643
Hold on. Yeah.

27:48.370 --> 27:49.778
Can we talk?

27:49.920 --> 27:52.105
Yeah, why don't you go
to your hotel room

27:52.153 --> 27:53.777
and give me a call?

27:55.534 --> 27:57.401
Look, I know the dinner
wasn't what you wanted.

27:57.457 --> 28:01.417
- I just am worried that you're...
- You're supposed to be by my side.

28:01.870 --> 28:03.863
But every time I try to reach for you,

28:03.911 --> 28:06.613
to grab you, it's like
my hand just goes right through.

28:06.661 --> 28:08.215
I can't
do it.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.761
I want to, but I can't.

28:10.824 --> 28:14.292
It's just... it's too much,
and... and I'm too alone,

28:14.386 --> 28:17.378
and when somebody says
they're gonna be there for you,

28:17.535 --> 28:19.800
they have to actually show up.

28:22.106 --> 28:23.591
I'm here now.

28:26.114 --> 28:27.722
You can't do this.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.136
I can.

29:02.003 --> 29:04.651
So the spring rolls were terrible.

29:04.741 --> 29:05.838
Mm-hmm.

29:05.905 --> 29:08.663
- But I thought the lobster was great.
- Yeah.

29:09.618 --> 29:10.931
Give the rest to Clark.

29:10.987 --> 29:12.174
No way.

29:12.225 --> 29:14.167
I'm keeping this for myself.

29:14.465 --> 29:16.401
But you're very thoughtful.

29:16.686 --> 29:18.245
People always say that.

29:19.637 --> 29:21.208
They don't always.

29:21.533 --> 29:25.503
- No one's ever said that about you.
- Never, not one time.

29:39.302 --> 29:41.387
That was a good date.

30:09.639 --> 30:10.905
<i>Hi, this is Valerie.</i>

30:10.953 --> 30:13.647
<i>I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message.</i>

30:33.548 --> 30:35.333
Wait, wait, wait.

30:35.381 --> 30:36.674
What?

30:36.799 --> 30:38.970
Come here.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.999
"Not false or fake."

31:14.394 --> 31:16.206
- F... not...
- "Real."

31:16.355 --> 31:17.784
63.

31:18.534 --> 31:19.929
Real?

31:20.620 --> 31:22.917
Well, that's a good question.

31:25.538 --> 31:28.402
We should do this every day, right?

31:28.620 --> 31:30.839
What, the... the crossword?

31:34.921 --> 31:37.667
At least until the construction stops.

31:41.431 --> 31:43.542
Did you have these made
before I got here?

31:43.648 --> 31:44.982
Nope.

31:45.808 --> 31:48.485
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

31:48.566 --> 31:50.487
- You did.
- No.

31:50.614 --> 31:51.964
- No, I didn't.
- You did!

31:52.012 --> 31:55.245
- You did. You did. You did.
- I did! I did!
