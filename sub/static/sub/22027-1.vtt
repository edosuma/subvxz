00:02.270 --> 00:03.204
- Mayday, Mayday.
Mouchie's having a heart attack.

00:05.073 --> 00:07.275
- They're suspending you
for 60 days without pay.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.443
I tried.
- You are so out of touch.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.778
I'm not what
I used to be.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.513
I'm retiring.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.048
This is my last shift.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.783
- We gotta get
out of here now.

00:15.816 --> 00:19.653
- Mouch, I'm so sorry, Mouch.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.291
- Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.792
- This situation with
my dad isn't ideal.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.294
- I want a date
when he's gone.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.528
- That is not how
marriage works.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.297
We talk things out.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.731
- I understand you wanting
to help out your dad, but--

00:30.764 --> 00:32.400
- Oh, you do?

00:32.433 --> 00:34.702
Because you're really,
really not showing it.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.705
[suspenseful music]

00:37.738 --> 00:38.806
*

00:38.839 --> 00:40.441
- Entrance is blocked.

00:40.474 --> 00:43.144
Evacuate that building
any way you can.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.545
- Is Gabby there?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.480
- Yeah, yeah, baby.
I'm here, I'm here.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.282
- Gabby.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.851
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.687
I love you.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.822
Bye, Gabby.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.225
- No.
No.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.670

Squad 3.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.341
Truck 81, Engine 51,

01:13.374 --> 01:15.443
if you can hear me,

01:15.476 --> 01:18.179
take cover anywhere
that you can.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.214
We're about to open up
the water cannons.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.817
- Chief, you'll
boil them alive.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.154
- What choice do I have?

01:26.187 --> 01:28.189
*

01:28.222 --> 01:30.591
It may not be much,
but it's all we got.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.726
*

01:32.760 --> 01:35.229
Cover yourselves.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.498
- Kannell, this way.
Let's move.

01:37.531 --> 01:41.235
Squad's headed to
the east stairwell, Chief.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.737
- Water cannons
go up in ten...

01:43.771 --> 01:45.739
*

01:45.773 --> 01:48.576
nine...

01:48.609 --> 01:51.512
- Hit it! Hit it!
- Eight...

01:51.545 --> 01:54.448
- Seven...

01:54.482 --> 01:56.450
six...

01:56.484 --> 01:58.452
- Cover yourself, baby.
- Five...

01:58.486 --> 02:00.688
- Come on, baby.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.757
- Four...

02:03.791 --> 02:06.794
three...

02:06.827 --> 02:08.796
two...

02:08.829 --> 02:10.898

02:10.931 --> 02:12.200
one.

02:12.233 --> 02:16.370
*

02:16.404 --> 02:18.639
That's it.
Open up the water cannons.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.409
Herrmann!

03:30.678 --> 03:32.480
Mouch!

03:32.513 --> 03:34.548
Herrmann!

03:38.352 --> 03:41.555
Herrmann.
Herrmann.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.591
Herrmann.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.459
- [panting]

04:00.574 --> 04:02.510
- Casey.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.612
Severide, Kannell, call out!

04:04.645 --> 04:07.681
- Kannell and I are safe, Chief.
We're headed out.

04:07.715 --> 04:11.819
- Do you have
eyes on Casey?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.053
- Negative, Chief.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.489
[alarm ringing faintly]

04:28.669 --> 04:30.671
- [grunts]

04:32.673 --> 04:34.775
Casey.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.649
Casey.
Casey!

04:41.682 --> 04:48.722
*

05:00.033 --> 05:03.804
As I think of the life
of Matthew Casey,

05:03.837 --> 05:07.941
certain words come
to the top of my mind.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.812
Honesty, integrity,

05:11.845 --> 05:15.082
bravery, sure.

05:15.115 --> 05:18.652
But there are other words
right there, too.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.921
Like...

05:20.954 --> 05:23.957
brother.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.926
Son.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.400
Husband.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.737
And I am lucky enough
to call him a friend.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.806
Matthew Casey...

05:43.877 --> 05:46.847
[gentle music]

05:46.880 --> 05:48.416
*

05:48.449 --> 05:52.620
I proudly bestow this
Medal of Valor upon you,

05:52.653 --> 05:54.955
not only because of
the bravery that you showed

05:54.988 --> 05:56.590
at the South Bishop fire,

05:56.624 --> 05:59.860
but also because of the valor
that you show

05:59.893 --> 06:04.698
on the streets of Chicago
every single day.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.535
Order arms.

06:07.568 --> 06:14.775
*

06:23.216 --> 06:25.619
[cheers and applause]

06:30.157 --> 06:32.025
- Good looking chest, boy.

06:32.059 --> 06:38.799
*

06:44.738 --> 06:46.774
- Listen, I--
- There's something I wanted--

06:46.807 --> 06:50.511
[both laugh]

06:53.080 --> 06:54.948
Dad, what's going on?

06:54.982 --> 06:56.784
- Uh, well, uh...

06:56.817 --> 06:59.186
What's going on is that
I am officially

06:59.219 --> 07:01.689
getting out of your hair.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.524
- What are you
talking about?

07:03.557 --> 07:06.093
- I cannot thank you two
enough for, uh,

07:06.126 --> 07:09.563
helping me right this ship
for the last couple of months.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.932
I've got three great
job leads, I'm--

07:11.965 --> 07:14.702
- Dad, we are happy
to have you stay with us.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.072
- Yeah, yeah.
More than happy.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.642
- I know,
and I appreciate it.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.512
But I've been imposing on you
for way too long.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.547
So there's nothing
more to be said.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.216
I love you so much, mija.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.619
- I love you, too.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.891
- Matt, congratulations
on the medal,

07:37.925 --> 07:39.793
and thank you sincerely.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.762
- Anytime.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.733
- Well, I'm on the move
to the next chapter

07:45.766 --> 07:48.536
on this adventure known
as the life of RamÃ³n Dawsona.

07:48.569 --> 07:49.570
- You know, if it
doesn't work out--

07:49.603 --> 07:50.871
- No, nope, nope, uh-uh.

07:50.904 --> 07:54.575
From now on,
it's nothing but up.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.578
Te amo mucho.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.781
- That was abrupt.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.618
- Yep.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.958
- You know, this is
the first time in months

08:10.991 --> 08:13.661
we've had the whole place
to ourselves.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.765
- Yep.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.743
- You'd better take
that uniform off.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.511
- Yep.

08:38.085 --> 08:41.054
[gentle music]

08:41.088 --> 08:48.128
*

09:22.896 --> 09:24.832
- Ah, Trudy.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.601
- Mouchie!
- Hey.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.070
- [laughs]
He's back.

09:31.939 --> 09:35.008
You look incredible.
Doesn't he look incredible?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.343
- Incredible.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.945
- It's good
to have you back, Mouch.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.112
- Thanks.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.681
- It's almost like
you didn't go visit him

09:40.714 --> 09:41.915
every single day
he was laid up.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.284
- I was on suspension
for 60 days.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.687
I had to keep
busy somehow, huh?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.722
Hey, come here.
Come on.

09:48.756 --> 09:51.124
I got something for you.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.393
- Hey, Mouch.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.995
- Keep them closed, okay?
- Yep, yep.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.097
- Okay, just turn here.
- Uh-huh.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.266
- All right.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.702
Ta-da!

10:01.735 --> 10:03.136
It's perfect, right?

10:03.170 --> 10:05.072
It marks your spot,

10:05.105 --> 10:07.775
and it provides
much-needed lumbar support.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.710
- That's really sweet
of you, Joe,

10:09.743 --> 10:12.913
but, uh, prolonged
sitting is linked

10:12.946 --> 10:15.983
to cardiovascular disease,
it turns out.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.086
- Of course.
So stupid.

10:19.119 --> 10:23.023
Ah! I know a fantastic
recipe for a power smoothie.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.225
- Ooh.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.728
- Hey.
[laughs]

10:27.761 --> 10:30.097
Hey, so, uh, is
he still trying to make up

10:30.130 --> 10:31.999
for how he jumped you
over that suspension?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.767
- Nah, it's water
under the bridge.

10:33.801 --> 10:37.070
- Not for him.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.006
- So hey, oh, boom-boom!

10:39.039 --> 10:40.741
How you feeling,
Dead Mouch?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.943
- I'm not dead, Herrmann.
- You flatlined!

10:42.976 --> 10:45.746
I have seen bodies in
the morgue move more than you.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.247
- Rearview mirror.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.917
I've got a whole new fitness
and nutrition regimen.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.720
I'm eating chia seeds
and all kinds of good stuff.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.155
- You look great, Mouch.
You really do.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.190
But the nickname Dead Mouch
is here to stay.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.892
- Yeah.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.229
- And I'm warning everyone
that if you persist

11:02.262 --> 11:04.331
in calling me that--
- Otis, Herrmann.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.999
Dead Mouch.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.768
- Okay, come on, you guys.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.837
Lay off Mouch, all right?
He's been through a lot.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.205
Here you go, buddy.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.306
- Mmm.
- Eh?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.942
- Mmm!
- Could I just--

11:14.975 --> 11:17.878
- Chia later.
- [laughs]

11:24.985 --> 11:26.219
- Can I help you, bud?

11:26.253 --> 11:30.157
- I'm looking for someone.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.092
Hey, bitch.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.194
What, you talk smack on me,
you don't think there's

11:34.227 --> 11:36.797
gonna be consequences?

11:36.830 --> 11:39.800
[dramatic music]

11:39.833 --> 11:42.502
*

11:42.535 --> 11:44.271
- This is where I work.
- Yeah.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.373
And my Angie's List page
is where I conduct my business.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.776
You neg-rep me online,
I can't fill the building.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.010
- Be a better landlord,

11:50.043 --> 11:51.478
and I'd be happy
to delete it.

11:51.511 --> 11:52.946
- Every day,
it's something with you.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.948
Leaky faucet, new paint.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.417
I've had more calls from you
than any tenant in 15 years.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.953
- Because you bully them the way
you're trying to bully me.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.289
The only difference is I'm not
gonna let you call me names

12:02.322 --> 12:03.523
and kick sand in my face.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.958
- I want your rent.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.760
- Fix the fridge,
and you'll get it.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.228
- Your check,
my mail box, Friday,

12:08.261 --> 12:09.396
or so help me God--

12:09.429 --> 12:11.131
- Renters' rights.
Look them up.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.066
- So help me God.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.108
- Hey, everything all right?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.276
- Yeah.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.246
Tucker messed
with the wrong tenant.

12:32.519 --> 12:32.853
.

12:32.886 --> 12:33.420
- Well, Lieutenant Casey,

12:35.088 --> 12:36.223
word churning
around headquarters

12:36.256 --> 12:37.891
is that you have
eyes on you now.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.359
- Uh-oh.
- In a good way.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.294
Title of captain
in your future.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.263
- Ooh, Lord help us all.
- [laughs]

12:43.296 --> 12:45.365
- Hey, I'm just glad
not to be an alderman.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.835
Told Gabby it's high time
I focus on the job

12:47.868 --> 12:49.369
I'm actually good at.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.971
- Hear, hear to that.

12:51.004 --> 12:54.808
So, regarding Jason Kannell.
- What's this?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.509
- Oh, we got denied
an extra man on squad,

12:56.543 --> 12:57.978
so Chief here--

12:58.011 --> 13:01.048
- I found him a permanent
spot on first shift.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.249
- Oh, that's great.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.518
I'll call him to celebrate.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.054
- Donna.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.588
To what do we
owe the pleasure?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.590
You know what?
To hell with what I owe.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.960
I am just pleased
to see you.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.262
- Aww, that's why
I married you.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.064
Boys, no matter how
many women say

13:17.097 --> 13:18.298
they don't like
to be sweet-talked,

13:18.331 --> 13:20.167
let me tell you, they do.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.468
- I'll keep that in mind.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.170
- Yeah,
you write that down.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.405
Get out.
[laughter]

13:25.438 --> 13:26.539
So?

13:26.573 --> 13:29.042
- Um, so I was coming
to remind you that

13:29.076 --> 13:30.243
tomorrow night is my first

13:30.277 --> 13:31.544
parent-teacher night
of the year,

13:31.578 --> 13:33.446
and you're gonna need
this carpool sign

13:33.480 --> 13:35.282
to pick up Terrence
from day care.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.384
- Right.
Consider it taken care of.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.452
- And, uh,
just remind me

13:39.486 --> 13:41.488
why I wanted to move
from 4th grade to high school.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.891
- Well, if words
serve me correctly,

13:43.924 --> 13:46.093
you said you need
more of a challenge.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.228
- Did I say that?
- You did.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.430
- Okay.
Oh, I gotta go.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.965
There's an assembly
this morning,

13:51.999 --> 13:53.200
so all hands on deck.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.168
- Okay, go get them.
- Okay.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.404
- Thanks for stopping by.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.374
- So I have great news.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.510
My friend, Hope Jacquinot,
is in town.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.879
She just texted me,
and she's on her way over here.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.447
- Go on.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.516
- Well, we used to call her
"Shock-and-Awe" in high school.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.584
I mean, because of her name,
but also because she was always

14:11.618 --> 14:13.453
just doing crazy stuff.
- Keep going.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.122
- You guys
are gonna love her.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.191
She was the Hog Queen of
Fowlerton four years running.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.927
- Okay, you can stop now.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.561
- No, that's a big deal.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.197
- I wanna party with this girl.
- It's an open invitation.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.033
I'm gonna take her
to Molly's tomorrow night.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.634
- Yeah, I'm gonna be needing
tomorrow night off, Herrmann.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.602
- Yeah, fat chance.
[laughter]

14:29.636 --> 14:32.072
- Fowlerton in the house.
- Oh, my God!

14:32.105 --> 14:34.074
Were your ears burning?
I was just talking about you.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.344
- All good, I take it.
- Oh, yeah. You look amazing.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.479
- She was actually
raving about you.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.348
Hi, Brian Zvonecek.
- Oh.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.951
- Joe Cruz. Nice to meet you.
- Oh.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.220
- Look at you, get to work
with a bunch of firemen.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.490
- Firefighters.
That's what we say.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.192
- How long are
you in town?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.394
- Just a couple of weeks.
I got an Airbnb.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.096
I'm free to hang.
- Amazing.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.998
- That is amazing,
'cause I actually own a bar.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.399
- Co-own.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.001
- I am a managing
part of the bar, so--

15:01.034 --> 15:03.503
- Okay, so I'm gonna go
check on lunch.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.505
Hope, it was
lovely to meet you.

15:05.538 --> 15:09.242
Don't worry about these two.
They're harmless.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.211
- Not too harmless,
I hope, hmm?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.912
[laughter]

15:14.647 --> 15:17.450
You, however--
[indistinct chatter]

15:17.484 --> 15:19.619
- Kelly, quick question.
- Yeah?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.554
- When you're working
on your core,

15:21.588 --> 15:24.591
do you concentrate on
fast-twitch isometric training,

15:24.624 --> 15:27.027
or do you go with
more low-intensity,

15:27.060 --> 15:29.396
high-impact repetition?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.264
- What?
- It's just, I've been doing

15:31.298 --> 15:32.699
some concentric CrossFit,
you know,

15:32.732 --> 15:35.068
since I have more of
a mesomorph physique.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.304
- I just lift weights, man.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.172
- Of course.
I mean, yeah, me too.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.541
Also I throw in
some Power Fit, X-Fit,

15:41.574 --> 15:43.743
you know, core balance
type thing.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.013
- Well, you look
absolutely great, brother.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.547
- Thank you.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.183
- Also, I have two tickets
to this week's Bears game.

15:50.217 --> 15:54.154
And they're yours.
50 yard line, 20 rows up.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.590
- Whoa.
Thank you, Joe.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.460
[laughs]

16:00.493 --> 16:03.130
- I will admit,
I like the sound

16:03.163 --> 16:04.564
of Captain Casey.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.299
Which would make me
Mrs. Captain Casey.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.567
- I gotta shut down
the speculation

16:07.600 --> 16:09.436
before it gets out of hand.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.071
- Which is just a temporary
step on the ladder

16:11.104 --> 16:12.372
to Chief Casey.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.041
- You're worse than
the rest of them.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.243
- You look good in white,
is all I'm saying.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.778
- Making Chief's
all about the politics.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.348
I've had enough of that
to last me a lifetime.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.550
From now on,
just give me an axe

16:23.583 --> 16:26.253
and a halligan,
point me toward a fire.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.488
- [chuckles]

16:38.698 --> 16:42.169
- I'm not gonna be too happy
when you outrank me.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.336
- Huh.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.072
- Just putting you
on notice.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.706
- Fair warning, then.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.442
- Well, Dawson says that
you gave her old man the boot.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.810
- She said what?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.612
- Well, she actually
said he just left,

16:52.645 --> 16:54.614
but I figured you--
- My hands are clean.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.416
He's gone of
his own accord.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.086
- Nice.
How'd that feel?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.088
- You have no idea.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.290
- Help!

17:03.323 --> 17:05.092
Help!

17:05.125 --> 17:07.594
Help, my girl!
My little girl!

17:07.627 --> 17:09.762
[tense music]

17:09.796 --> 17:11.431
Help me!

17:11.464 --> 17:13.166
- Gabby.
- Brett.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.235
- Come on.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.237
Here.
Set her down here.

17:17.270 --> 17:24.477
*

17:29.849 --> 17:30.217
.

17:30.250 --> 17:30.550
- Her eyes.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.520
She was eating,
and then her eyes--

17:33.553 --> 17:34.687
- All right. Come on.
Give them some room.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.156
- She's choking.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.790
- She was probably
trying to cough,

17:37.824 --> 17:40.160
and she busted some
blood vessels in her eyes.

17:40.193 --> 17:43.763
- Nothing.
- I'll get the forceps.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.298
- Will she be blind?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.834
- Let's try to
get her breathing first.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.536
What was she eating?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.304
- Hot dogs.
- Hey, hey, hey.

17:51.338 --> 17:54.307
[tense music]

17:54.341 --> 18:01.314
*

18:07.754 --> 18:09.422
- Damn it.
One more push.

18:13.693 --> 18:14.694
Got it.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.762
- [sighs]

18:15.795 --> 18:17.664
- [coughs]

18:17.697 --> 18:20.767
- Let's get her to Med.
- Yeah.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.304
- Honey, how do you feel?
- It hurts.

18:24.337 --> 18:28.308
- I see you guys race out
onto the street every day.

18:28.341 --> 18:31.678
I will never complain
about the sirens again.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.180
Hey, baby.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.348
- Happy we could help.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.322
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.557
- Okay, come with us.
- Yes, ma'am.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.163
[alarm blares]

18:52.632 --> 18:55.302
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:55.335 --> 18:58.638
- Oh, Hope.
I'm so glad you made it.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.341
- I mean, I've never been
to a firefighter bar before.

19:01.374 --> 19:05.745
- Oh, yeah, we've got cops,
doctors, lawyers--

19:05.778 --> 19:07.747
Well, not so many
lawyers, anyway.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.416
Anyway, what can I
get you to drink?

19:09.449 --> 19:11.551
- Um, can you make
a Moscow Mule?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.320
- You got it.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.491
- Oh, uh, yeah,
I should warn you.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.360
Kelly Severide's
probably not the best guy

19:20.393 --> 19:22.362
for you to set
your sights on.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.630
- What's that?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.333
- Uh, Hope was
staring at Kelly.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.369
- I don't know about staring.
I mean, look at him, though.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.905
- Well, he recently lost
his girlfriend to cancer.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.508
- Oh.
- Yeah. It was awful.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.510
And before you think you can be
the shoulder that he cries on,

19:37.544 --> 19:39.812
just know that he's
already been comforted

19:39.846 --> 19:41.914
by half the women in Chicago,
so...

19:41.948 --> 19:45.218
[mellow rock music]

19:45.252 --> 19:46.719
- * Doesn't matter...

19:46.753 --> 19:48.788
*

19:48.821 --> 19:50.657
- Oh, hey.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.792
Can you switch with me tomorrow
night and close the shop?

19:52.825 --> 19:54.527
I got a thing.
- What thing?

19:54.561 --> 19:57.930
- Uh, it's, uh...

19:57.964 --> 19:59.766
escape room design class.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.968
- Oh.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.637
Well, can't.
Looking at apartments.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.606
- Well, then why'd you make me
say what I was doing then?

20:06.639 --> 20:09.809
- I just wanted to see what you
had planned on a Saturday night.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.578
- Looking for apartments?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.413
I thought you had
a three-year lease.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.681
- Oh, yeah.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.850
Apparently I violated
the tenant-renter agreement.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.719
- No.
- Yeah.

20:19.752 --> 20:20.920
He evicted me.

20:20.953 --> 20:24.324
- Oh. I'm so sorry.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.293
Well, there's a fold-up cot
in the corner.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.860
Herrmann likes to use it
when he has early deliveries

20:27.894 --> 20:29.329
and he doesn't want to
drive across town.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.298
- I wondered what that
was doing here.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.932
- Yeah, just, you know,
use it as long as you need,

20:32.965 --> 20:35.001
and shower at the firehouse.

20:35.034 --> 20:38.438
And don't tell anybody
about the design class.

20:53.453 --> 20:57.390
- Hi. I'm Hope.
Sylvie's friend

20:57.424 --> 21:01.027
- Ah. Kelly.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.863
- You, um, left your
phone at the bar.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.998
- Ah, no, I was just
keeping my spot.

21:06.032 --> 21:10.703
- Well, I might've
put my number in it.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.005
- You did, did you?

21:13.039 --> 21:15.342
- [laughs]
Yeah.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.478
I just wanted you to know
that you can text me anytime.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.547
- Okay.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.024
- Boo.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.059
- Dad.
- Hey.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.628
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.929
- It's good to see you.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.765
- I thought I'd pop in.
Say hello.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.099
I'm sorry I haven't called.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.868
I've been on
the job hunt, just--

21:41.901 --> 21:44.504
- Yeah, how's that going?
- Okay.

21:44.537 --> 21:48.007
I got a second interview
at one place, so we'll see.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.610
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.646
- Well, uh, keep us posted, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.749
- Good to see you, Pops.
- Good to see you.

22:06.693 --> 22:10.863
Um, I talked to
Chaplain Orlovsky.

22:10.897 --> 22:14.534
And, uh, he said that, uh,
you haven't been by to see him.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.605
- Been busy.

22:23.075 --> 22:26.413
- Kitten, you told me

22:26.446 --> 22:29.115
that when Matt
said good-bye in that fire

22:29.148 --> 22:32.351
that it almost broke
everything inside of you.

22:35.988 --> 22:39.091
Look, uh, I'm not
a counselor, baby girl,

22:39.125 --> 22:44.631
but maybe that moment
was a little crack.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.667
Maybe it widened
some other cracks

22:47.700 --> 22:49.736
that were already there.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.671
I don't know.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.039
But this is true,

22:53.072 --> 22:55.475
and you need to
listen to me, hija.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.445
If you don't
repair these cracks,

22:58.478 --> 23:02.515
then the whole foundation
comes crumbling down.

23:02.549 --> 23:07.086
So if it's not the chaplain,
just talk to someone.

23:10.457 --> 23:13.460
- I was upset,
and I'm good now.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.995
Okay?
Just needed some time.

23:16.028 --> 23:19.131
Which I got.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.200
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.036
- Glad to hear that.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.105
Okay.

23:26.138 --> 23:29.108
[somber music]

23:32.645 --> 23:34.614
[sighs]

23:37.917 --> 23:38.050
.

23:38.084 --> 23:38.785
- So I don't know
what anybody did.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.055
What's she
showering here for?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.724
- She got the boot
from her apartment.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.693
She's a bad tenant.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.160
- Aw.
- Yeah.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.729
I'd offer her a spot with us,

23:49.762 --> 23:51.097
but we're stuffed
to the rafters.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.099
She said she's out
looking for a new place.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.835
- I had that mother-in-law suite
that we fixed up for Dawson.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.970
But then Henry
decided to move in

23:58.004 --> 24:01.173
because he says that
he's mostly an adult now.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.476
- Oh, mostly.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.712
[shower running]

24:19.526 --> 24:21.794
- Herrmann,
will you hold my feet

24:21.828 --> 24:24.030
while I get in
some crunches?

24:24.063 --> 24:26.899
Oh.
Okay.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.501
[grunts]

24:28.535 --> 24:30.770
- There you go, buddy.
Nice.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.240
- [grunting]
- Almost there.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.743
There you go.
Stay strong.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.779
- And ten.
Thanks, Joe.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.081
- Pleasure's all mine.
- Whoo.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.916
Whoo.

24:46.185 --> 24:49.922
What?

24:49.956 --> 24:51.824
- How long are you
gonna keep this going?

24:51.858 --> 24:54.661
- I am committed
to my fitness regime.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.829
- No, I'm not
talking about fitness.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.731
I'm talking
about Joe Cruz

24:58.765 --> 25:00.299
turning into your
personal valet.

25:00.332 --> 25:04.070
You're letting him put
lipstick on and kiss your ass

25:04.103 --> 25:05.838
like it's your birthday.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.940
- Uh, I think you're being
a little exaggerated

25:07.974 --> 25:09.175
in your description.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.777
- Enough's enough.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.912
Tell the guy that
you forgive him,

25:12.945 --> 25:15.548
and let him get on
with his life.

25:15.582 --> 25:18.818
- Here you go, Mouchie.
Nice hot towel.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.987
- Ooh. Oh.
- Yeah.

25:21.020 --> 25:24.857
Helps get out the toxins.
- Why thank you, Joe.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.127
- Okay.
- So good.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.261
- Yeah.

25:29.295 --> 25:32.565
- Oh. Ooh.
Ah.

25:32.599 --> 25:35.167
- Christopher.
- Hey, Chaplain Orlovsky.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.736
Great to see you, Padre.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.838
- Yeah, always good
to stop by 51.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.708
- So, you just visiting,
or does the big man upstairs

25:41.741 --> 25:43.209
got some
urgent business?

25:43.242 --> 25:44.877
- Is Gabby Dawson around?

25:44.911 --> 25:48.147
- Oh, I saw her--
she's probably--

25:48.180 --> 25:50.116
I don't know.

25:50.149 --> 25:53.853
- Anyway, I'll, uh, be around
for a bit if anyone wants to,

25:53.886 --> 25:55.888
you know, download on me.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.691
- Weird how you tend
to visit around lunch.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.126
Funny.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.728
- Divine guidance.

you and Kidd together.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.986
Mouch, how you feeling?

27:00.019 --> 27:01.921
- Like riding a bike,
Lieutenant.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.122
- You're with Otis.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.924
- What about you,
Lieutenant?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.292
- I'm sure Chief is
going in on this one,

27:06.325 --> 27:08.127
so I'll stay close to him.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.862
- I'll cover the chief.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.798
That means I want the three
of you on a controlled sweep

27:11.831 --> 27:13.099
of wherever
the fire's the hottest.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.967
These kids are
gonna be panicked,

27:15.001 --> 27:16.769
so point them
toward the exits.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.337
Make sure you don't stop
except for anyone down.

27:18.370 --> 27:19.939
- You got it, Lieutenant.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.808
- Hit the ground
running, boys.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.209
Here we go.

27:23.242 --> 27:30.282

let's make our lines.

Come on.
We drilled for this.

27:35.054 --> 27:40.159
Don't panic.
Come on, everybody out.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.061
- Get two hose lines in there.
- Copy that.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.363
- Truck, Squad,
search and evacuate.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.364
Let's go.

[screaming]

27:51.003 --> 27:52.772
You seen Donna Boden?

27:52.805 --> 27:55.207
- I saw her running
toward the fire.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.909
It started in
the chemistry lab.

27:56.943 --> 27:59.045
- Make a path.
Keep moving.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.080
This way.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.715
Be careful.

28:02.749 --> 28:04.984
- If you have trouble breathing,
I want you to sit down.

on the way, guys.

Clear out.

Come on.

28:28.474 --> 28:31.010
Handle that!

Let's go.

Hey. Move, move!

28:53.866 --> 28:56.368
- Hey!
Get out now!

Go, kid.

the right to get out.

Donna.

Ms. Wagner,
the chemistry teacher.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.159
She's still inside
the classroom.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.393
I had to get
the kids out.

- Got it.

I got you.

Fire's out.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.042
- What's the count?

31:16.075 --> 31:19.045
- Everyone's
accounted for, Chief.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.483
- You're in.
Let's get her out of here.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.322
- Hey.
Can I go with you?

31:30.356 --> 31:34.093
- Yeah, of course.

31:34.126 --> 31:37.063
- I'll finish up here.
Meet you at Med.

31:47.373 --> 31:50.943
- Too soon, Herrmann.
- Too soon.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.245
- I just got off
the phone with command.

31:53.279 --> 31:58.417
And I have successfully signed
up Firehouse 51's second shift

31:58.450 --> 32:02.021
for the Firefighter Muster.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.090
- What the--

32:04.123 --> 32:06.125
- It's like an Olympics
for firefighters.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.659
There's the bucket
brigade challenge,

32:07.693 --> 32:09.428
the two-man carry,
the ladder--

32:09.461 --> 32:12.664
- I know what a Muster is.
But you signed us up?

32:12.698 --> 32:16.202
- That's right.
And I'm the coach.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.504
[groaning and murmuring]

32:18.537 --> 32:21.073
- Sounds horrible.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.409
- Yeah, I don't know.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.080
- I need this.

32:38.024 --> 32:41.127
No one but Herrmann
knows this,

32:41.160 --> 32:46.032
but I came this close
to walking off this job.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.668
And I'm not--
I'm not talking

32:49.701 --> 32:51.503
about my heart stopping.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.272
Before that.

32:53.305 --> 32:58.144
I almost gave up the second
greatest thing in my life

32:58.177 --> 33:02.081
because I was feeling
a little run down.

33:02.114 --> 33:06.385
And when I was lying
on the ground

33:06.418 --> 33:08.787
in that burning factory,

33:08.820 --> 33:11.557
the one thing I thought about

33:11.590 --> 33:14.060
was it wasn't enough.

33:16.062 --> 33:19.465
Not enough
time with Trudy.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.034
Not enough time at 51.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.103
Not enough time
with you guys.

33:24.136 --> 33:27.406
My brothers and sisters.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.342
So...

33:30.376 --> 33:33.045
yeah.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.281
I signed us up,

33:35.314 --> 33:39.151
because, man,

33:39.185 --> 33:41.287
I treasure these moments

33:41.320 --> 33:43.189
when we're together.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.557
And I don't wanna be
looking down the dark end

33:45.591 --> 33:50.262
of that tunnel ever again,

33:50.296 --> 33:52.464
thinking it wasn't enough.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.467
[gentle music]

33:55.501 --> 34:02.708
*

34:10.116 --> 34:12.318
- Of course
we'll be there.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.486
- Come here.
Thanks, buddy.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.423
- This event is mandatory.

34:17.456 --> 34:20.759
- Yeah!
Yeah!

34:20.792 --> 34:22.361
This is a great idea.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.796
- Thank you, buddy.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.223
- So you all
just moved in together?

34:51.257 --> 34:53.392
- Yeah.
Worked out perfectly.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.362
They needed a bigger place,
and I didn't like living

34:56.395 --> 34:58.764
by myself,
so opportunity came knocking,

34:58.797 --> 35:00.399
and I answered.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.467
- So cool.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.801
- Yeah, they're great.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.637
Like big brothers, really.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.339
- If you lived with
two men in Fowlerton,

35:07.373 --> 35:09.875
you'd get run out on a rail.
- Oh, God, I know.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.411
Well, you are gonna love
this place we're going dancing.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.845
It's called Primary.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.182
It's a total scene,
but it's a lot of fun.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.684
Actually, I met this
Canadian guy there once

35:18.717 --> 35:20.652
who asked me to marry him,

35:20.686 --> 35:22.688
which I don't
really remember.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.690
I think I had a little
too much to drink.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.426
But Dawson talked me
out of matrimony.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.429
Thank God that didn't happen.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.697
Who are you texting?

35:31.730 --> 35:34.566
- My mom.
- Oh.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.768
[phone chimes]

35:38.537 --> 35:40.739
[knocking]

35:48.480 --> 35:50.549
- Aww.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.652
You look like
a lost little puppy.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.521
- Look, if you're just
gonna make fun of me,

35:55.554 --> 35:59.325
I'm gonna go back to--

35:59.358 --> 36:02.561
I guess I don't really have
anywhere to go back to.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.564
- Come on in.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.434
- Thank you.

36:08.467 --> 36:11.703
[sighs]

36:11.737 --> 36:16.675
Thank you for offering
to let me crash here.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.577
- You're welcome.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.779
And there's no way I'm gonna
stop making fun of you.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.349
- Guess I brought
it on myself.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.750
- Yeah.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.652
"He messed with
the wrong tenant."

36:26.685 --> 36:28.320
- Look, how was
I supposed to know

36:28.354 --> 36:31.223
I overstepped
the rental agreement?

36:31.257 --> 36:32.358
- Common sense?

36:32.391 --> 36:34.960
- Fine.
Deserved.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.930
And, I mean, this is
just for a few weeks.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.999
I'm still looking
for my own place.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.234
- I get it.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.635
- Okay.

36:43.669 --> 36:48.974
And, you know, uh, feel free
to do whatever you need to do.

36:49.007 --> 36:53.745
With whomever
you need to do it with.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.981
- I will.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.690
There's beer in the fridge.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.992
- Say no more.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.835
- They just opened.
Otis was telling me about it.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.837
Supposed to be
great crab legs.

37:18.870 --> 37:22.641
We should go
before there's a line.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.276
- Yeah, sounds good.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.645
- Did you hear
from your dad?

37:26.678 --> 37:28.580
- He got the job.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.816
- That's great.
- Yeah.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.451
Second interview,
they hit it off.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.685
He starts Monday.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.654
- See?
Sometimes--

37:35.687 --> 37:37.923
- Don't ever say
good-bye to me again.

37:42.861 --> 37:45.831
[gentle music]

37:45.864 --> 37:53.271
*

37:54.806 --> 37:58.043
- I'd been meaning
to say something, but--

37:58.076 --> 38:02.348
just didn't know how,
or what.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.585
- I know that you'll never stop
running into burning buildings

38:06.618 --> 38:08.754
any more than I'll stop
putting my life on the line

38:08.787 --> 38:10.922
every time
the ambo rolls out.

38:15.361 --> 38:20.532
But just tell me right now that
you'll always come back to me.

38:20.566 --> 38:22.768
And I'll believe you.

38:34.846 --> 38:37.449
- I'll always
come back to you.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.662
- So thank you.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.598
Just go tell
everyone you know.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.800
- Okay.

38:58.804 --> 39:03.509
Okay, uh...

39:03.542 --> 39:05.411
Okay, they said that
Mrs. Wagner went in

39:05.444 --> 39:09.948
for a second surgery,
and it is still critical.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.484
So we just need
to wait and see,

39:12.518 --> 39:14.720
and keep praying.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.088
Okay?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.694
It's gonna be okay, honey.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.696
All right?

39:24.730 --> 39:27.699
[tense music]

39:27.733 --> 39:31.670
*

39:31.703 --> 39:32.938
Wallace, uh--

39:32.971 --> 39:35.541
- What is it?

39:37.743 --> 39:40.546
- The fire
wasn't an accident.

39:40.579 --> 39:45.383
*

40:22.621 --> 40:24.656
