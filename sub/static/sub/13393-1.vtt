00:26.534 --> 00:30.338
- I think this thing is broken!
- Did you take off the lens cap?

00:31.273 --> 00:34.676
Proof that I.Q. and breast size
clearly aren't related.

00:34.776 --> 00:36.686
Hello!

01:03.871 --> 01:08.243
Welcome to this year's Sigma
Cappa Delta Slut Cam Games.

01:08.343 --> 01:09.845
Did you check the focus
on the camera outside?

01:09.945 --> 01:13.582
Yep. Yesterday. You shuffled
the hay around in the barn scene?

01:13.682 --> 01:17.686
I sure did, Pa.
Want to go for a roll in it?

01:17.786 --> 01:22.324
- Kaitlin, whose camera is that?
- It is Katrina's dad's camera.

01:22.424 --> 01:25.394
You don't even want to know
the sick shit we found on here.

01:25.494 --> 01:29.395
Kat, your mom's going to have
to fire the babysitter!

01:30.465 --> 01:33.402
- Everybody was invited?
- Triple checked, captain!

01:33.502 --> 01:36.427
All right, I think we're in good shape.

01:37.071 --> 01:39.708
You built us a beautiful house.

01:39.808 --> 01:44.579
Tonight Corey Peters and Elaina Forrester

01:44.679 --> 01:47.482
undergo their final challenge

01:47.582 --> 01:52.257
and we'll see who gets to be crowned
our next sorority sister!

01:52.357 --> 01:56.391
I cannot wait to see
the looks on their faces.

01:56.491 --> 02:00.495
- We should make them play truth or dare.
- Oh, my God. What are you, 12?

02:01.395 --> 02:04.166
- You think they'll show up?
- Really?

02:04.266 --> 02:06.468
I know it's Saturday
and it's Devil's Night.

02:06.568 --> 02:10.239
- What else are they supposed to do.
- They'll come. They'll flock like lemmings.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.925
There hasn't been a haunted house
this close to campus before.

02:13.025 --> 02:16.158
Lookie what I found!

02:19.013 --> 02:22.451
It takes a lot more dick
than this to satisfy me!

02:22.551 --> 02:25.020
That's disgusting.
Now I want to bleach my imagination.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.823
- Are you getting the jitters?
- I'm fine. It's just...

02:27.923 --> 02:30.993
- Mental checklist leads to over-thinking.
- Well, stop it.

02:31.093 --> 02:34.051
You're making me nervous
and I don't want to be nervous.

02:35.997 --> 02:38.600
- Now you have me thinking.
- Don't.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.792
No one could have planned this
better than you.

02:45.022 --> 02:46.091
Here's hoping...

02:46.191 --> 02:50.145
Congratulations finding the only outfit on
the planet to make you look any skinnier.

02:50.245 --> 02:51.910
Shut...

02:55.149 --> 02:57.170
Little higher.

02:57.684 --> 02:59.922
Perfect. Use the knot I taught you.

03:00.022 --> 03:02.824
I'm glad having you
as my foreman is over tonight.

03:02.924 --> 03:05.761
- Shut up. You'll miss me.
- I was a model for a bit.

03:05.861 --> 03:09.853
No, sweetheart,
you were in a PSA about Hep C.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.800
Bitch.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.368
Do you want me to get the blood bucket?

03:13.468 --> 03:16.304
The lighting and shock effect
should be enough on their own.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.830
I'm going to the monitors.
Time to power up.

03:27.283 --> 03:29.784
As president,
I'd just like to say it's been...

03:29.884 --> 03:33.048
fun getting to know you both
these past couple weeks.

03:33.288 --> 03:35.590
Welcome to The Scarehouse!

03:35.690 --> 03:39.016
- That's impressive!
- Wait for it.

03:39.895 --> 03:44.049
- Enter if you dare.
- You evil genius!

03:44.149 --> 03:46.902
It's set to open every three
or four minutes to let a few more in.

03:47.002 --> 03:48.570
That way we don't get overwhelmed.

03:48.670 --> 03:52.474
This year's challenge
will require... balls.

03:53.274 --> 03:56.300
I'd love to say more
but I have to get ready!

03:56.645 --> 04:00.799
- Get out! It's my turn!
- It's my fucking house!

04:00.899 --> 04:04.830
- Jesus Christ, Jackie!
- Don't say that!

04:04.930 --> 04:08.245
Sorry. Not on Devil's night.

04:10.324 --> 04:13.895
Oh, my God!
Now I have Katrina's cooch on my lips!

04:16.231 --> 04:18.533
- The rooms are ready?
- Check.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.325
All right, let's shit some pants!

04:26.273 --> 04:29.644
<i>Dear sisters, you are cordially
invited to this year's</i>

04:29.744 --> 04:33.148
<i>Sigma Cappa Delta Halloween V.I.P. Bash.</i>

04:33.248 --> 04:36.645
<i>In order to reach this private event,
you will have to face your deepest</i>

04:36.745 --> 04:40.789
<i>and darkest fears inside the Scarehouse.</i>

04:40.889 --> 04:43.358
<i>1635 Ellis Drive.</i>

04:43.458 --> 04:46.060
<i>See you there, bitches.</i>

04:46.160 --> 04:48.900
I don't know if my Grandma would approve
of the way I invested the money

04:49.000 --> 04:53.125
- she set me up with.
- Invite her down, let her watch.

04:54.302 --> 04:56.804
Hi, Grandma, what are you doing?

04:56.904 --> 05:01.443
Knitting me another labia pink scarf
I will never wear. How wonderful!

05:01.543 --> 05:04.846
Hey, I know you've already had bridge
and aqua fit this week,

05:04.946 --> 05:07.616
but how would you like to come down
to an old textile plant

05:07.716 --> 05:10.085
and watch Elaina and I...

05:10.185 --> 05:13.343
- Oh, for...
- Don't wet yourself.

05:22.430 --> 05:23.721
Fucker!

05:26.384 --> 05:28.875
This isn't funny!

05:37.778 --> 05:40.637
Hot damn, this is going to be good.

05:51.359 --> 05:53.950
It's so weird seeing her.

05:54.261 --> 05:56.820
She looks almost the same.

06:02.169 --> 06:06.041
Emily Lewis, are you here for the party?

06:06.141 --> 06:08.042
Yes.

06:08.142 --> 06:11.746
Did you come alone
as per your instructions?

06:11.846 --> 06:13.482
I did.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.284
Are you ready to face your fears?

06:16.384 --> 06:18.853
And possibly regrets.

06:18.953 --> 06:21.056
Let's get this party started!

06:21.156 --> 06:22.361
Indeed.

06:23.091 --> 06:26.817
Enter if you dare.

06:28.863 --> 06:31.533
They've already got enough skeletons
in there, you skinny bitch!

06:31.633 --> 06:34.826
You'll never make it out alive!

06:49.251 --> 06:52.044
You're going to let me through, right?

07:00.995 --> 07:02.887
Hello?

07:04.766 --> 07:08.025
Fine. Eat me then!

07:13.942 --> 07:16.268
Who planned this?

07:18.178 --> 07:21.049
Why would you hit me!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.707
No!

07:26.855 --> 07:29.657
This isn't the party, is it?

07:31.058 --> 07:32.916
Okay.

07:35.094 --> 07:37.051
Please don't rape me.

07:37.151 --> 07:42.459
I think you'll find we lack
an essential tool to fulfill that fantasy.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.541
You guys are girls?

07:46.641 --> 07:48.510
Disappointed?

07:48.610 --> 07:50.168
Corey?

07:54.482 --> 07:57.902
- Corey, please! What are you...
- Relax!

07:58.002 --> 08:01.557
We're here to make things
a little bit... tighter.

08:01.657 --> 08:03.697
If anything.

08:11.781 --> 08:14.836
You're still doing
the big sweater thing, aren't you.

08:14.936 --> 08:17.761
All bun, no meat.

08:19.056 --> 08:21.818
Do you think we could help her
with that, Elaina?

08:23.428 --> 08:26.186
I might have just the thing.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.827
How many letters did I write you?

08:33.636 --> 08:35.707
Can you believe that, Elaina?

08:35.807 --> 08:39.578
63 letters I write Miss Ripe Peach

08:39.678 --> 08:41.996
and not a single response.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.583
How rude.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.314
What are you going to do?

08:46.414 --> 08:50.921
What is the point in not eating...

08:51.021 --> 08:53.538
if you're not going to flaunt your figure?

08:53.638 --> 08:59.386
I was afraid that we would be reunited
tonight and you'd be a fat train wreck.

09:01.199 --> 09:03.902
What is it you always told me?

09:04.902 --> 09:08.162
A girl should always want to be thinner?

09:10.975 --> 09:13.467
Do you like party games, Emily?

09:16.848 --> 09:19.417
I don't want to play.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.288
If I recall, you love this game.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.723
Truth...

09:24.823 --> 09:27.792
You answer all our questions honestly.

09:27.992 --> 09:29.561
Dare...

09:29.661 --> 09:31.096
Well...

09:31.196 --> 09:35.133
we dare you to do something
and you will comply.

09:35.233 --> 09:37.193
What kind of dares?

09:39.270 --> 09:41.396
Truth...

09:41.496 --> 09:44.576
- or dare?
- Dare.

09:44.676 --> 09:49.047
- What should it be?
- I know. It's perfect for you.

09:49.147 --> 09:53.240
I dare you... to be skinnier!

09:57.287 --> 10:00.281
- It's too tight!
- Said no guy ever.

10:01.326 --> 10:05.464
- Next round, Em!
- Truth... or dare?

10:05.564 --> 10:07.033
Truth!

10:08.733 --> 10:12.462
Where were you on October 30th,
two years ago?

10:13.805 --> 10:16.841
Oh, come on.
You guys already know where I was.

10:16.941 --> 10:20.836
- A half truth.
- More like a dodged truth, really.

10:21.479 --> 10:23.114
What should we give her for that?

10:23.214 --> 10:27.541
I'd say free dinner somewhere nice
but she wouldn't eat it.

10:27.686 --> 10:30.689
You know what, you get
this round. Truth or dare?

10:30.789 --> 10:35.059
Look, I know what you two are up to
and I will not be a part of it.

10:35.159 --> 10:40.204
I'm afraid you already are and you
made that choice a long time ago.

10:55.145 --> 10:57.035
Emily...

10:57.135 --> 11:00.999
- truth or dare?
- Dare.

11:06.323 --> 11:09.193
I can still see some fat.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.552
Corey, would you help her with that?

11:20.437 --> 11:22.229
No, no.

11:36.454 --> 11:39.124
You're not wimping out on me, are you?

11:39.724 --> 11:42.182
You almost look as bad as she does.

11:46.930 --> 11:49.067
Emily, you heard her...

11:49.167 --> 11:52.572
- truth or dare?
- Truth.

11:55.143 --> 11:58.013
Unnecessary boob shot.

11:59.498 --> 12:03.235
- Look at that cleavage.
- That bitch is an emotional terrorist.

12:03.335 --> 12:06.972
She better not be going to this thing
tonight, I can't stand her.

12:07.072 --> 12:10.108
How's that $30 spray tan
working out for you?

12:10.208 --> 12:12.728
I don't know, you tell me!

12:12.828 --> 12:14.813
Fuck off!

12:14.913 --> 12:18.817
If I had tits like that, it would not have
taken me till I was 18 to get some dick.

12:18.917 --> 12:21.153
Shelby, did you bring my black shoes?

12:21.253 --> 12:23.222
- I don't have them.
- Yes, you do.

12:23.322 --> 12:24.790
No, I don't.

12:24.890 --> 12:28.977
You borrowed them from me
two days ago, liar!

12:31.962 --> 12:33.848
Bitch!

12:35.299 --> 12:38.102
Is she taking a bath?

12:38.902 --> 12:41.640
It doesn't count if you try
to baptize yourself.

12:41.740 --> 12:44.007
Stupid cunt!

13:04.277 --> 13:06.990
How much longer?

13:20.359 --> 13:24.080
Shelby Hickman,
are you here to attended the party?

13:24.180 --> 13:25.963
Yes, sir.

13:28.833 --> 13:32.137
Did you come alone
as per your instructions?

13:32.237 --> 13:34.474
Just me.

13:34.774 --> 13:37.696
Are you ready to face your fears?

13:38.427 --> 13:40.177
Yeah, I'm ready.

13:43.482 --> 13:47.020
Enter if you dare.

13:47.620 --> 13:50.556
Hey, does the carpet match the drapes?

13:51.556 --> 13:54.407
You'll never make it out alive!

13:59.565 --> 14:01.369
Shelby!

14:02.601 --> 14:05.287
You guys don't look very scary.

14:12.779 --> 14:17.130
You forgot your corset, but I'm sure
you can liven up the room a little.

14:18.717 --> 14:22.016
Are we scary now, cunt?

14:28.761 --> 14:31.164
Already? Stack 'em up!

14:33.064 --> 14:34.801
Is that dress sprayed on?

14:34.901 --> 14:39.138
I can't tell. We should bring her in
so we can judge her better.

14:39.238 --> 14:42.975
Katrina Larson, welcome to the party.

14:43.075 --> 14:45.512
Thanks. How do I open this?

14:45.612 --> 14:48.662
Did you come alone
as per your instructions?

14:50.448 --> 14:53.399
Do you see anyone else with me?

14:55.520 --> 14:57.957
Are you ready to face your fears?

14:58.057 --> 15:01.094
Okay, sure, whatever, Jackie.
It's cold out here.

15:01.194 --> 15:03.663
Try more clothes!

15:04.663 --> 15:06.966
Enter if you dare!

15:07.066 --> 15:10.303
- What, do sluts get in for free?
- Slut discount!

15:10.403 --> 15:13.353
You'll never make it out alive!

15:28.922 --> 15:31.946
I'll eat your soul!

15:45.037 --> 15:48.788
See the freak show. One night only!

16:14.996 --> 16:17.470
What kind of cunt jumps someone
in a haunted house?

16:17.570 --> 16:19.019
This kind!

16:23.942 --> 16:28.348
Who knew a whore like you
could take a good choking?

16:28.848 --> 16:31.070
Slut!

16:38.923 --> 16:40.751
Slut.

16:42.694 --> 16:45.545
Let's get wonder whore out of here.

16:47.065 --> 16:50.970
- We want to see your holy hole!
- Get out of here, you perverts!

16:51.070 --> 16:53.353
Close the door!

16:56.175 --> 16:58.895
Don't worry,
she's not always this controlling.

16:58.995 --> 17:02.582
One, yes, she is.
Two, the only reason why I put with her

17:02.682 --> 17:05.684
is so I know I'm not
the biggest cunt out there.

17:05.784 --> 17:08.954
- Stop saying that word!
- I don't say it that much.

17:09.055 --> 17:11.723
- Bullshit!
- She's a cuntasaurus.

17:11.824 --> 17:14.292
She's such a cunt! Cunt! Fucking cunt!

17:14.393 --> 17:18.060
Cunt hear you! Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!

17:18.364 --> 17:22.381
It's the final cuntdown!

17:38.350 --> 17:42.602
Daddy, they made me have it here,
I told them that it wasn't allowed.

17:56.202 --> 17:58.671
Who picked out your outfits?

17:58.771 --> 18:00.806
Twinsies!

18:00.906 --> 18:03.210
- Geoff just sent me a dick pic.
- That's nasty.

18:03.310 --> 18:08.495
Emily, if and when you do start fucking,
I bet you fuck like an accountant.

18:10.015 --> 18:12.751
Corey and Elaina.

18:12.851 --> 18:15.167
One row for each of you.

18:15.587 --> 18:18.257
Thrown 'em back before we go!

18:18.557 --> 18:21.026
Whorey-Corey in the lead!

18:21.126 --> 18:24.614
Trust me, you're going to want
to be socially lubricated.

18:24.714 --> 18:27.717
- We all had to do it.
- One more!

18:27.817 --> 18:29.702
Good girl!

18:29.802 --> 18:32.371
Elaina, how do you feel?

18:32.471 --> 18:34.554
I'm fine.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.682
Well engineered, winner.

18:43.782 --> 18:47.467
I think somebody needs a costume change.

18:49.637 --> 18:51.461
I think the limo's here!

19:07.472 --> 19:11.444
Waking up naked in a strange room
isn't much of a new thing for you?

19:11.544 --> 19:13.507
Nice one!

19:13.607 --> 19:16.863
- How'd you get out?
- Good behaviour.

19:18.984 --> 19:22.045
You know what I missed
the most on the inside?

19:22.145 --> 19:24.323
A nail file.

19:24.423 --> 19:26.359
Good quality shampoo.

19:26.459 --> 19:29.028
- My vibrator.
- Yes.

19:29.128 --> 19:32.331
Yes. Exactly.

19:32.831 --> 19:37.082
Elaina, do you think Katrina here
has been missing any of that?

19:44.542 --> 19:48.114
Short of a good waxing,
I don't see what else she's missing.

19:48.214 --> 19:51.514
You know what? She looks even more fake
than the last time we saw her.

19:51.614 --> 19:54.687
Fake? How can that be?

19:54.787 --> 19:56.822
She's all natural.

19:56.922 --> 19:59.458
She prides herself on it.

19:59.558 --> 20:01.829
Don't you, Kat?

20:03.529 --> 20:06.313
Is this party your idea then?

20:09.867 --> 20:14.339
This is what? You're trying to embarrass me
for doing what was right for the sorority?

20:14.439 --> 20:16.023
Right?

20:22.514 --> 20:24.850
Told ya!

20:24.950 --> 20:27.420
It's just as fake as her story.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.321
I'm sorry...

20:30.421 --> 20:32.540
- what was right?
- You don't know how hard it was to...

20:32.640 --> 20:35.173
...and I think that somewhere
along the way you lost touch

20:35.283 --> 20:39.197
with one of the founding ideals
of our little sisterhood:

20:39.297 --> 20:42.680
finding strength in your inner beauty.

20:45.001 --> 20:49.374
I wanted to visit.
I did, I wanted to talk.

20:49.474 --> 20:52.310
You've spent so much time
Frankenstein-ing yourself

20:52.410 --> 20:57.362
that I think it's time for the good
doctor and I to kill the monster.

20:59.584 --> 21:02.287
Elaina, since we're all sharing here...

21:02.387 --> 21:05.190
what did you miss most on the inside?

21:05.290 --> 21:07.091
Getting my nails done.

21:07.191 --> 21:09.844
There's just no good way
to sneak in an Asian lady,

21:09.944 --> 21:12.339
no matter how small they are.

21:15.327 --> 21:18.009
Prison changes you.

21:18.959 --> 21:20.776
Stop!

21:21.462 --> 21:24.300
Nobody asked you, slut,

21:24.400 --> 21:29.051
so save your breath
for the next time that your mouth is full.

21:29.504 --> 21:33.242
Corey, why don't you tell us
what you missed inside?

21:33.542 --> 21:37.079
When you have nothing to do but think...

21:37.779 --> 21:40.383
I thought a lot about you, Katrina.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.448
All sorts of things, as you can imagine.

21:45.688 --> 21:50.215
But what I really wanted to know was...

21:50.315 --> 21:54.230
what it would feel like
to have these long...

21:54.330 --> 21:57.754
natural... eyelashes.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.657
Take a big, deep breath.

22:08.373 --> 22:11.095
- Are those real?
- They are real.

22:11.195 --> 22:12.997
Verbatim.

22:13.997 --> 22:18.135
Let's see if you are a grand prize winner.

22:27.898 --> 22:33.586
So, like, what is this?
Some sort of sex party? Need a dude?

22:38.377 --> 22:40.214
Well...

22:40.714 --> 22:44.217
- we just might.
- Seriously?

22:44.317 --> 22:46.435
If you can handle it.

22:46.535 --> 22:49.370
Let me show you something special.

22:51.456 --> 22:53.394
What was that?

22:53.494 --> 22:57.819
That's what a female orgasm
sounds like. Unfamiliar?

23:08.275 --> 23:12.779
Okay, we are just going
to finish up our girl fun,

23:12.879 --> 23:15.315
so you just try not
to blow your load, okay?

23:15.415 --> 23:17.298
Okay.

23:23.123 --> 23:24.972
Right.

23:30.531 --> 23:32.746
Be right back, big boy.

23:33.265 --> 23:36.103
What the fuck? We have to get rid of him.

23:36.203 --> 23:39.806
No, we don't.
We have a plan and we stick to it.

23:40.406 --> 23:43.910
How far are we going to get
if he wanders out of there?

23:44.010 --> 23:46.747
He's piss drunk,
he probably won't even remember!

23:46.847 --> 23:48.882
Oh, probably?

23:48.982 --> 23:51.885
This is your fault. You were supposed
to make this place idiot proof!

23:51.985 --> 23:56.456
This is applied engineering.
It's a fourth year class.

23:56.556 --> 23:59.960
You know I only had textbook theory
for half a semester.

24:00.060 --> 24:03.984
- It's the same thing.
- No, it's not!

24:04.084 --> 24:08.035
I built this place on a lot of theory
and this is a test run.

24:08.135 --> 24:11.905
So give me a fricken break
on a few minor flaws.

24:12.005 --> 24:13.840
Minor flaws?

24:13.940 --> 24:19.220
Forgetting to put out chips and dip
is a minor flaw. A witness is major!

24:19.320 --> 24:23.458
Everyone's going to know we did this,
Corey! Why do you even care?

24:23.558 --> 24:27.520
He's not leaving here alive.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.056
You're going to lock him in that closet

24:30.156 --> 24:33.507
and someone's going
to find him when we're done.

24:34.626 --> 24:37.044
Do you understand?

24:40.900 --> 24:44.337
Fine, but I'm knocking him out.

24:44.437 --> 24:46.272
Whatever.

24:46.372 --> 24:48.188
Go.

25:02.355 --> 25:05.873
Grab his phone. Go!

25:08.360 --> 25:10.797
Oh, my God.

25:11.297 --> 25:15.019
Oh, my God, you guys,
please help me! Please!

25:15.269 --> 25:17.204
Please help me!

25:17.304 --> 25:19.119
Hey!

25:20.239 --> 25:23.624
Shut up, bitch!

25:23.910 --> 25:25.545
Your acting sucks balls.

25:25.645 --> 25:28.031
- She's really hot, though.
- Yeah, in a mousey way.

25:28.131 --> 25:32.934
No! No! Oh, my God, you guys!
Stop! Please!

25:50.202 --> 25:52.705
Please, no more.

25:52.805 --> 25:54.942
We'll go to the police together.

25:55.042 --> 25:57.744
You don't get to enter a plea deal.

25:57.844 --> 26:01.161
It didn't work for Elaina and I in court.

26:03.232 --> 26:05.318
Please stop.

26:05.418 --> 26:08.469
You're lucky you only had
one night of torment.

26:10.222 --> 26:15.259
The cards fell exactly as they should've.
Two people in jail instead of all of us.

26:16.028 --> 26:18.432
So we didn't matter?

26:19.332 --> 26:23.820
Swept under the rug.
Brandon's family hating us.

26:24.170 --> 26:27.007
People throwing rocks
through my mom's window.

26:27.107 --> 26:30.678
No chance at a normal life,
and all for what?

26:31.278 --> 26:36.140
So you could keep whoring your way through
the student body trying to not feel alone?

26:37.217 --> 26:39.820
Katrina, look at me!

26:39.920 --> 26:42.656
I lost everything!

26:42.756 --> 26:46.760
My family says they know it was a mistake,
but I can see it in their faces.

26:46.860 --> 26:51.078
In all their faces!
I'm a fucking disgrace!

26:53.999 --> 26:58.123
Go on, Katrina, bargain with that.

26:59.905 --> 27:05.035
You want money? 'Cause if you let me call
my dad, he'll give you anything you want.

27:05.635 --> 27:07.347
Oh, that's rich.

27:07.447 --> 27:13.166
That way you can see us go back to jail
while you cover your scars with more money?

27:23.261 --> 27:25.913
You think this is funny?

27:35.007 --> 27:40.227
Elaina, you know how Matt kept
visiting you in jail those first few months?

27:45.484 --> 27:49.039
Yeah, I fucked him every night
when he got back.

27:49.139 --> 27:51.625
Told him everything was going to be okay.

27:53.025 --> 27:55.496
He confided in me.

27:55.796 --> 27:58.599
Why do you think he stopped visiting?

27:59.399 --> 28:02.502
I helped him get over you,
like the rest of us did.

28:02.602 --> 28:05.452
People move on. I think you should too.

28:06.672 --> 28:10.310
But now, instead,
you're going back to jail

28:10.410 --> 28:12.612
where you belong!

28:12.912 --> 28:18.265
No, I won't be. See you in hell,
you arrogant, diseased twat.

28:27.511 --> 28:30.182
Well, that was unscripted.

28:30.282 --> 28:33.655
I... I told you, I...

28:33.755 --> 28:36.402
I only have the theory down.

28:42.159 --> 28:44.963
Why does everyone think I'm a lesbian?

28:45.063 --> 28:48.467
I spent two years in a women's
correctional facility,

28:48.567 --> 28:52.237
I think I would know if I was gay or not.

28:52.337 --> 28:57.386
Same reason my shrink and my mom both
think I need anger management therapy.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.776
I think there's some truth in it.

29:19.529 --> 29:23.167
What the fuck are you looking at, Emily?

29:25.336 --> 29:26.438
God.

29:26.538 --> 29:29.421
Make me a drink, cunt!

29:39.851 --> 29:42.287
You might want to stick to water.

29:42.387 --> 29:44.423
You don't want to do anything you regret.

29:44.523 --> 29:48.593
So we're still a few hours away from
finding out who our new sister will be...

29:48.693 --> 29:52.711
but first we have to find our victim.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.486
You'll see.

29:59.304 --> 30:03.341
Kaitlin, put the fucking camera down
and join us! Get drunk!

30:03.441 --> 30:05.290
Okay.

30:08.846 --> 30:11.783
Can... can I get some water or something?

30:11.883 --> 30:13.699
Nope.

30:14.951 --> 30:17.522
Oh, my God!

30:17.622 --> 30:20.105
Is that Katrina?

30:21.792 --> 30:26.354
You know, without her boobs
she's almost impossible to recognize.

30:28.532 --> 30:32.037
Elaina, I know you're upset.

30:32.137 --> 30:34.773
I know this is revenge
for Brandon's death,

30:34.873 --> 30:37.943
but come on!

30:38.043 --> 30:42.488
You are already wrong about two
of the three things you just said. Sit tight.

30:47.886 --> 30:50.536
Here, catch!

30:54.291 --> 30:56.995
And to clarify those two inaccuracies:

30:57.095 --> 31:01.547
I'm not upset
and Brandon's death is your fault.

31:40.805 --> 31:42.842
Fuck me.

31:43.742 --> 31:47.012
It's a hard scale to rate by tonight's
events, but you're hitting a new level

31:47.112 --> 31:50.182
I don't even think there's a word for yet.

31:50.482 --> 31:53.451
Everybody gets the same advice
when they turn 13:

31:53.551 --> 31:57.803
if it burns too much,
you're screwing the wrong people.

31:59.557 --> 32:02.727
How many years do you think
they'd throw at us for all this?

32:02.827 --> 32:05.931
I don't care. It's worth it.

32:06.831 --> 32:09.007
Think Lisa will like this?

32:10.402 --> 32:13.620
I call it... prison sex.

32:15.740 --> 32:18.357
Let's just hope this dries in time.

32:20.011 --> 32:22.828
I don't think I can watch this one.

32:24.115 --> 32:27.018
Are you ready to face your fears?

32:27.468 --> 32:29.127
You betcha.

32:30.989 --> 32:33.391
It's really too bad about this one.

32:33.491 --> 32:37.693
- I thought she was cool.
- You'll never make it out alive!

32:55.380 --> 32:59.275
This is what you look like behind
that camera not having any fun!

32:59.375 --> 33:01.820
You have it the wrong way...

33:01.920 --> 33:03.769
cunt!

33:19.938 --> 33:22.107
Hey, you know what?
You think you're so good, Jenner.

33:22.207 --> 33:25.243
You're not... you're not so good.
I know you.

33:25.343 --> 33:29.783
I could have you down on your knees
if I wanted to, you little slut.

33:31.283 --> 33:34.408
Why don't you suck my dick?

33:44.830 --> 33:48.733
Oh, let me guess. Leatherface is next?

33:48.833 --> 33:53.905
I am going to punch her in the box
for insulting our hard work.

33:54.005 --> 33:57.074
This is a good goddamned haunted house,

33:57.174 --> 33:59.992
not some Orlando theme park.

34:02.914 --> 34:05.031
Let me get her. I hate her more.

34:14.759 --> 34:16.409
Nice costume.

34:16.510 --> 34:18.244
What the fuck?

34:27.021 --> 34:30.705
- I think we're in trouble.
- I'm going to eat that bitch for breakfast!

34:37.065 --> 34:38.933
Lisa!

34:39.873 --> 34:42.117
Oh, Lisa!

34:56.484 --> 35:00.588
- Shelby? Shelby!
- Lisa, you've got to get me out of here!

35:00.688 --> 35:04.025
They're dead! You got to help me!
They're going to kill us!

35:04.125 --> 35:07.128
- Shelby can you hear me?
- Lisa, run!

35:07.228 --> 35:09.404
Behind you!

35:16.470 --> 35:18.740
Call 9-1-1!

35:19.090 --> 35:21.907
- Shelby, don't worry!
- Please help me!

35:23.126 --> 35:24.710
No!

35:26.863 --> 35:29.448
Thought you had the upper hand?

35:31.636 --> 35:34.102
Run! Get help!

35:38.042 --> 35:41.179
- She'd heading for the basement!
- There's no way out of there, just...

35:41.279 --> 35:42.962
bolt the door!

36:09.105 --> 36:12.525
Damned technology, makes it almost
impossible to get away with murder.

36:30.294 --> 36:32.730
Sluts and liars they are,

36:32.830 --> 36:35.266
but tardy they are not.

36:35.766 --> 36:37.602
Let's go.

36:38.402 --> 36:40.555
Come on, we'll deal with Lisa later.

36:41.105 --> 36:44.609
Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee,
gotta pee, gotta pee!

36:45.509 --> 36:47.846
What do we have here?

36:49.246 --> 36:51.316
This is so going on the internet!

36:51.416 --> 36:55.019
- I slept with that guy freshman week.
- Was it good?

36:55.119 --> 36:56.988
No, ma'am.

36:57.188 --> 36:59.758
Who's that, your boyfriend?
You can't go one night without him?

36:59.858 --> 37:02.960
How long's Emily been... you know...

37:03.660 --> 37:06.364
Around the time that the rest
of us all lost our virginity,

37:06.464 --> 37:08.466
she lost a bunch of weight to compensate.

37:08.566 --> 37:12.570
And Jacqueline, really and truly,
she believes in that fire and brimstone shit?

37:12.670 --> 37:15.840
100% on the Jesus train.

37:16.340 --> 37:18.976
What about Shelby? She seems nice.

37:19.076 --> 37:22.547
I don't know. She hasn't told the truth long
enough for me to know what to make of her.

37:22.647 --> 37:25.817
I feel like that time
that I took too much molly

37:25.917 --> 37:29.067
and tried to make love to my cousin.

37:40.764 --> 37:42.848
Kaitlin Bowden?

37:45.035 --> 37:47.052
Have you come for tonight's party?

37:49.272 --> 37:52.898
Do you even know what
Halloween is, you dumb slut?

38:12.262 --> 38:14.479
Where is she?

38:41.091 --> 38:45.163
Guys, you know I don't like the dark!

38:45.263 --> 38:48.066
And being alone.

38:49.266 --> 38:53.251
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I think I heard a spider!

38:55.939 --> 38:58.943
- Sounds like she's near the entrance.
- Oh, God.

38:59.043 --> 39:01.746
- Should we go get her?
- I don't like funhouses!

39:01.846 --> 39:03.714
I have to hit the washroom.
Can you grab her?

39:03.814 --> 39:06.084
- Again?
- Does no one care about me?

39:06.184 --> 39:09.722
If you must know,
this is not a number one trip.

39:09.822 --> 39:11.923
And you have to go right now?

39:12.023 --> 39:16.175
- Yes, who plans these things?
- Oh, disgusting.

39:18.261 --> 39:21.312
Hey, just be glad
you weren't my cell mate.

39:24.969 --> 39:29.501
I feel like something is watching me and I
don't think that I can handle any of this!

39:39.482 --> 39:41.186
- Hi, Kaitlin.
- I know I'm a complete pussy

39:41.286 --> 39:44.013
but I can't even watch scary movies.
That freaking clown thing from IT

39:44.113 --> 39:46.924
did it to me when I was 6
and my brother was watching the DVD.

39:47.024 --> 39:50.132
Please, take me to the party
and I'll take whatever humiliation

39:50.232 --> 39:53.464
- her highness has cooked up.
- I don't think you'll like tonight's punishment.

39:53.564 --> 39:57.335
I will chug the hot sauce,
I will show the guys my taut-tauts,

39:57.435 --> 40:00.261
I will eat the worm
and/or wear a dunce cap. I just...

40:00.361 --> 40:04.856
I cannot and will not
walk through this thing alone.

40:07.845 --> 40:09.707
Okay then.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.430
Right this way.

40:14.217 --> 40:16.003
Thank you.

40:16.103 --> 40:18.820
Pleasure is all mine, I'm afraid.

40:22.159 --> 40:25.978
Once you check in,
you may never check out!

40:36.307 --> 40:39.191
Ready to join us, big boy?

40:40.844 --> 40:42.661
Again?

40:43.980 --> 40:46.151
Yes... again.

40:46.551 --> 40:49.320
Round two, bitches!

40:49.420 --> 40:51.427
So charming.

41:18.252 --> 41:21.085
This way, this way, this way.

41:21.185 --> 41:23.487
Here? Okay.

41:25.154 --> 41:27.071
Drop 'em.

41:27.390 --> 41:28.759
Why?

41:28.859 --> 41:31.829
Typically, blowjobs work better
without them.

41:31.929 --> 41:33.745
Right.

41:40.004 --> 41:42.907
First penis I see in two years
and this is what I get?

41:43.007 --> 41:45.433
Honey, there's not much in there.

41:46.143 --> 41:50.548
Come on, baby, you know you're wet for me.

41:50.648 --> 41:53.231
Wrap your lips around me.

41:53.884 --> 41:57.788
Hey, you know, if you broke your neck

41:57.888 --> 42:00.424
you could probably suck your own dick.

42:00.524 --> 42:02.440
What?

42:06.329 --> 42:08.366
Hey, Lisa!

42:08.466 --> 42:11.169
Don't think I forgot about you!

42:11.269 --> 42:15.086
You're due for your annual physical!

42:45.902 --> 42:48.239
...and I just... I pray for his family.

42:48.339 --> 42:51.089
Now, these girls were pledges...

42:53.477 --> 42:57.014
Is it just vodka tonight
or did we splurge on champagne?

42:57.114 --> 42:59.471
I did vodka last night
a little too hard and...

42:59.571 --> 43:01.853
I don't think we're going
to be friends for a while.

43:01.953 --> 43:05.991
We've got you covered for life.
This way, we're almost there.

43:07.557 --> 43:09.844
Four vodka crans!

43:09.944 --> 43:13.330
Hey! Why don't we go back to your place

43:13.430 --> 43:17.368
and we open a bottle of wine,
we light a fire, unwrap a condom.

43:17.468 --> 43:21.239
Brandon, you're drunk,
you want to fuck, we get it!

43:21.339 --> 43:24.008
But it's my birthday and I...
want to celebrate...

43:24.108 --> 43:26.144
with her... yeah!

43:26.244 --> 43:29.547
Well, birthday boy, she'll never
love you as much as she hates herself,

43:29.647 --> 43:31.916
so beat it!

43:32.616 --> 43:36.020
- I like most of myself!
- Move!

43:36.120 --> 43:39.724
All right, wait, wait, wait... no condom?

43:39.824 --> 43:42.360
Birthday douchebag, Brandon Philips,

43:42.460 --> 43:46.331
practically volunteered himself!

43:46.881 --> 43:50.685
As sisters we need to stick together.

43:50.835 --> 43:55.073
Brandon needs to be... shamed.

43:55.173 --> 44:00.244
You and Elaina are going to take
a little photo of Brandon...

44:00.344 --> 44:04.195
wearing... this!

44:05.366 --> 44:09.837
Whichever one of you ladies
posts the photo that gets the most likes

44:09.937 --> 44:13.741
has a place amongst us at noon tomorrow.

44:14.291 --> 44:16.193
We like you...

44:16.293 --> 44:18.596
so this is a little bonus

44:18.696 --> 44:22.933
in case he has problems
finding his inner drag queen.

44:23.033 --> 44:26.236
Pop a few of these in his drink and...

44:26.336 --> 44:29.674
voilà. Party time!

44:31.242 --> 44:35.445
You have to bring the camera though.
We want to see everything.

44:40.483 --> 44:45.122
Now that, as they say ladies
and gentlemen, is taking a load off.

44:45.222 --> 44:47.528
I feel so much better.

44:47.628 --> 44:50.007
They invited you?

44:51.227 --> 44:53.598
That was you?

44:54.531 --> 44:57.602
My mom saw you guys on TV
when they let you out.

44:58.102 --> 45:00.952
You look really good.

45:05.074 --> 45:09.346
This isn't... isn't a party, is it?

45:09.446 --> 45:13.784
Well, fatty, it is, but it's our party.

45:13.884 --> 45:16.587
By the way, don't they have treadmills
on the outside anymore?

45:16.687 --> 45:20.290
Corey, party's a strong word.

45:23.993 --> 45:25.810
Shelby?

45:28.097 --> 45:30.301
Are they dead?

45:30.401 --> 45:32.984
They're going to kill us too!

45:34.105 --> 45:38.476
We're not going to kill anyone.
We just want answers.

45:38.576 --> 45:42.312
These girls jerked us around, so, really,
it would be to your advantage to...

45:42.412 --> 45:44.633
just tell us all kinds of truth tonight.

45:48.852 --> 45:53.939
What are you doing to do? Scrape me?
Put poor Emily's rib down.

45:59.929 --> 46:02.333
Whose idea was it?

46:02.433 --> 46:04.969
Will you let us go?

46:05.069 --> 46:09.073
We deserve to ask you
these questions, don't you think?

46:09.173 --> 46:14.443
They wanted us to do interviews about you
and we said no, we didn't take any of them.

46:14.578 --> 46:16.847
How noble.

46:17.047 --> 46:19.280
Was it your idea then?

46:20.450 --> 46:22.403
- Are you lying to us, Shelby?
- No!

46:22.503 --> 46:26.240
Bullshit, if it wasn't your idea,
then you would tell us.

46:26.590 --> 46:28.960
The plan was already in motion.

46:29.060 --> 46:31.429
None of us wanted you to go to jail.

46:31.529 --> 46:35.700
What happened to Brandon was
unfortunate but it was an accident.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.736
I know it was an accident. I was there.

46:38.836 --> 46:43.474
But it's still an accident that I lost my
scholarship over and two years of my life.

46:43.574 --> 46:47.225
It was your idea to roofie Brandon!

46:49.813 --> 46:52.317
- Elaina, think this through, this is fucked up.
- Come on, Corey!

46:52.417 --> 46:55.596
No, have you ever been roofied?
This is like rape! Okay?

46:55.696 --> 46:58.409
Come on, you think Brandon's
going to run to the police with a story

46:58.509 --> 47:00.458
- that a girl tried to rape him?
- I don't know!

47:00.558 --> 47:03.360
Really? Brandon! Of all guys?

47:03.460 --> 47:05.220
Elaina!

47:06.330 --> 47:08.699
This is such a bad idea.

47:09.099 --> 47:11.936
- Elaina, listen...
- No, you listen to me.

47:12.036 --> 47:14.738
If you don't want to do this,
that's fine, I don't care.

47:14.838 --> 47:17.856
You can go out there and tell them
who their new sister is.

47:19.842 --> 47:21.959
I'll miss you.

47:26.582 --> 47:29.488
What's done is done.

47:29.588 --> 47:32.256
I'm afraid we're all in this together.

47:32.356 --> 47:36.994
We went along with it.
Seemed too good to be true.

47:37.094 --> 47:40.002
You were the only ones that took the pictures,
maybe it was easy to plead

47:40.102 --> 47:41.966
that you acted alone.

47:42.066 --> 47:45.436
Corey, be a darling
and get me the gun, please.

47:45.536 --> 47:48.803
- I'm tired of this drivel.
- No no, wait! It was...

47:49.773 --> 47:55.626
If you touch me again, I swear to God
I will kick the shit out of you!

47:56.779 --> 48:00.150
Do not take what she says as my word.

48:00.250 --> 48:02.853
I want to know whose idea this was...

48:03.153 --> 48:07.424
and if you guys tell us,
we're going to get a lot friendlier.

48:07.524 --> 48:11.208
- Absolutely!
- It was Katrina!

48:12.362 --> 48:17.865
So you two are telling me that you
had no choice in this whatsoever?

48:18.535 --> 48:21.005
It was the wrong place
at the wrong time for all of us.

48:21.105 --> 48:24.642
Do you think she made mine
or Kaitlin's life easy?

48:24.742 --> 48:28.895
But Katrina's dead now.
You have had your revenge.

48:28.995 --> 48:30.936
Just let us go.

48:32.266 --> 48:36.677
We were never here.
We're good at keeping secrets.

48:40.256 --> 48:43.541
Lisa almost had a nervous breakdown!

48:46.896 --> 48:52.598
I would gladly take Lisa's breakdown
over a single day in prison.

48:55.071 --> 48:57.958
Under the table, there's a garbage bag.

48:58.608 --> 49:00.624
Open it.

49:04.564 --> 49:07.248
Take one and give it to Kaitlin.

49:10.019 --> 49:12.603
Take the other one for yourself.

49:14.557 --> 49:18.009
Kaitlin, hit Shelby with it.

49:21.431 --> 49:26.953
There may or may not be a form
of powered acid in those pillows.

49:27.053 --> 49:31.942
Elaina cooked up some
Walter White shit especially for you.

49:32.042 --> 49:36.213
Now give us an old-fashioned gladiator
showdown sorority-sleepover style.

49:36.313 --> 49:39.096
Last one alive wins.

49:41.467 --> 49:43.785
No! No, wait!

49:56.700 --> 49:59.803
- Shit.
- What's the plan?

50:00.403 --> 50:02.506
I don't have a plan.

50:02.606 --> 50:04.975
Well engineered. Take this! Okay?

50:05.075 --> 50:09.349
You take care of those...
and I'll take care of him.

50:09.449 --> 50:12.316
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

50:12.416 --> 50:14.251
Awesome!

50:14.651 --> 50:18.255
Come here. Is that your room?

50:18.755 --> 50:22.993
- Elaina, make us drinks or something!
- She should come too! Yeah.

50:23.993 --> 50:27.631
We need a dirtier song
for this! Let's see...

50:32.502 --> 50:34.304
Perfect!

50:35.504 --> 50:39.023
- Elaina!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

51:14.577 --> 51:19.296
- Help, get us out of here!
- They think we're part of the attraction!

51:20.916 --> 51:24.138
You. This is all your fault!

51:24.238 --> 51:26.607
You and your string of lies!

51:26.757 --> 51:28.570
You fat...

51:33.362 --> 51:35.213
liar!

51:37.133 --> 51:40.351
How long do you think
it's going to take them to die?

51:43.372 --> 51:45.589
Let's just go.

51:47.376 --> 51:50.881
- We're not done.
- But we are, Corey!

51:51.481 --> 51:55.219
Don't you feel this satisfaction?
It's practically pumping through my veins.

51:55.319 --> 51:57.621
We're not done.

51:58.121 --> 52:02.359
- But the girls are victims too.
- Well, they didn't have to stay silent.

52:02.459 --> 52:04.822
Scared or not. They wronged us.

52:04.922 --> 52:09.036
- But it was Katrina.
- I don't care about Katrina!

52:11.801 --> 52:15.172
Why can't we just call it
what it is and end it?

52:15.272 --> 52:18.609
You can do whatever you want,
but I'm finishing this.

52:18.709 --> 52:22.026
They deserve it. All of them.

52:24.071 --> 52:27.038
What if their families don't deserve it?

52:29.292 --> 52:31.362
My mother died because of them.

52:31.462 --> 52:35.083
Your mother died
of a heart attack last June!

52:37.800 --> 52:39.851
Did she?

52:48.231 --> 52:50.649
My mom took pills.

52:53.537 --> 52:55.955
Corey, I didn't...

52:57.275 --> 52:59.766
You want to guess why?

53:02.780 --> 53:06.278
'Cause of... what we...

53:08.953 --> 53:10.784
Jesus.

53:23.635 --> 53:26.505
You can end this now...

53:26.605 --> 53:30.747
but don't take this away from me.
I need this.

53:33.778 --> 53:36.361
Fuck these girls.

53:38.816 --> 53:41.434
No, fuck this!

54:06.912 --> 54:09.496
No, Elaina, no!

54:24.596 --> 54:27.079
I need this too.

54:31.268 --> 54:34.419
I'm glad you won't miss
the surprise I have for you.

54:36.974 --> 54:39.278
I just hope you like it.

54:41.412 --> 54:45.450
<i>Elaina Forrester and Corey Peters
have been found guilty of manslaughter.</i>

54:45.550 --> 54:47.853
<i>Last fall, the two girls
staged a practical joke</i>

54:47.953 --> 54:50.789
<i>aimed at shaming fellow student,
Brandon Philips.</i>

54:50.889 --> 54:53.375
<i>Lewd photos were taken of
the unconscious 19-year-old</i>

54:53.475 --> 54:56.111
<i>after the slipped Rohypnol into his drink.</i>

54:56.211 --> 54:58.980
<i>Later that night Philips asphyxiated
on his own vomit,</i>

54:59.080 --> 55:01.233
<i>resulting in his untimely death.</i>

55:01.333 --> 55:04.670
<i>Both Forrester and Peters maintain
that there were others involved</i>

55:04.770 --> 55:08.706
- <i>in this prank turned nightmare.</i>
- <i>I can't say for certain...</i>

55:08.806 --> 55:11.710
<i>but from what I've been hearing
around campus</i>

55:11.810 --> 55:15.080
<i>one of the girls did have a...</i>

55:15.180 --> 55:19.660
<i>a torrid affair with Brandon.
And this was supposed to be...</i>

55:20.752 --> 55:23.088
<i>some sort of way to get back at him.</i>

55:24.288 --> 55:27.792
<i>I believe in... in God's great mercy</i>

55:27.892 --> 55:32.465
<i>and I believe in the law enforcement
of our community.</i>

55:32.765 --> 55:36.012
<i>I know that justice will be found.</i>

55:36.112 --> 55:39.852
- <i>And I trust in the Lord...</i>
- Holy shit!

55:41.238 --> 55:43.655
How long has she been here?

55:44.675 --> 55:47.731
- Five days.
- Fuck off!

55:49.296 --> 55:51.721
Isn't anyone looking for her?

55:55.252 --> 55:58.156
Thank God nobody calls anyone anymore?

55:58.256 --> 56:02.694
I've been texting loser guys all week...
which is kind of fun actually.

56:02.794 --> 56:07.099
By the way, Jackie, I told Brian
that you were seeing Professor Anston,

56:07.199 --> 56:09.835
who apparently loves anal.

56:09.935 --> 56:11.536
You naughty girl!

56:11.636 --> 56:15.266
I would advise you not to talk
to either of them, ever again.

56:15.366 --> 56:18.677
And... I've already had sex with Jessie.

56:18.777 --> 56:21.780
It really wasn't very good
so I'll save you the disappointment.

56:21.880 --> 56:26.317
I told him that you had herpes and that
you're shy about it. What are friends for?

56:26.417 --> 56:30.155
Elaina... she's been texting Richard.

56:30.755 --> 56:32.782
My brother?

56:37.328 --> 56:40.079
Wait till the trial starts.

56:44.435 --> 56:46.705
Good evening, ghouls and goblins.

56:46.805 --> 56:50.308
I regret to inform you but that
will be all for tonight's Scarehouse.

56:50.408 --> 56:55.761
Please hurry towards the nearest exit
before we let the real monsters out.

56:58.215 --> 56:59.651
That's that.

56:59.751 --> 57:04.236
<i>Now, Jacqueline, how did you feel personally
about these two girls when you met them?</i>

57:06.123 --> 57:08.731
<i>I try to approach...</i>

57:08.831 --> 57:12.531
<i>every person that I meet with the fullness
of God's love in my heart.</i>

57:12.631 --> 57:15.567
<i>I can speak with absolute accuracy</i>

57:15.667 --> 57:18.286
<i>that not one of our members</i>

57:18.386 --> 57:23.175
<i>participates in any sort of...
sort of hazing or...</i>

57:23.275 --> 57:27.212
<i>initiation rituals that involve
illegal activity of any kind.</i>

57:27.412 --> 57:29.548
I haven't even seen any of this.

57:29.648 --> 57:31.683
My dad DVR'd everything.

57:31.883 --> 57:37.002
I was looking for a slip-up,
something the lawyers could use.

57:38.922 --> 57:41.199
Oscar-worthy!

57:43.161 --> 57:46.311
<i>No mother should have
to lose a little boy.</i>

57:48.732 --> 57:51.603
- This is sick.
- Wait until you see the one where...

57:51.703 --> 57:56.675
she talks about how she believes you were
on drugs when you attacked Brandon.

57:56.775 --> 58:01.479
Or the one where she's crying
while she's singing Jesus songs

58:01.579 --> 58:04.315
at Brandon's candle vigil.

58:04.415 --> 58:07.853
- And she actually believes herself.
- I thought she'd be easier to break

58:07.953 --> 58:11.804
if we gave her a little taste
of solitary confinement.

58:23.200 --> 58:25.385
How you holding up?

58:26.371 --> 58:28.454
Want some?

58:32.609 --> 58:35.547
Taking Emily's advice to heart?

58:35.647 --> 58:38.931
I've never seen her with nothing to say.

58:40.984 --> 58:43.535
You can't break my spirit.

58:46.156 --> 58:49.792
On the contrary, I'd count on it.

59:08.345 --> 59:10.963
You know what we want, right?

59:15.786 --> 59:18.991
He gives strength to the weary...

59:19.591 --> 59:22.861
and increases the power of the weak.

59:22.961 --> 59:25.764
Those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength

59:25.864 --> 59:30.148
and will soar on wings like eagles...

59:30.952 --> 59:33.046
and not be faint.

59:40.644 --> 59:43.615
Someone brushed up on their Christianity.

59:43.715 --> 59:45.216
Oh, right.

59:45.316 --> 59:49.128
Jackie, the uber-moraled
Pastor's daughter.

59:49.537 --> 59:53.355
It's an act. It was always an act.

59:54.058 --> 59:56.341
I don't know.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.414
Go get the weight.

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:09.588
You might want to keep your hands up.

01:00:11.843 --> 01:00:15.091
Jacqueline Gill, you are here today
to answer for your crimes

01:00:15.191 --> 01:00:18.324
against Elaina Forrester and Corey Peters.

01:00:18.424 --> 01:00:21.786
I saved five people.

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:26.157
Objection. You didn't save anyone.
You endangered them.

01:00:26.257 --> 01:00:28.293
And now...

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:31.262
they're dead.

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:33.832
That's a lie.

01:00:33.932 --> 01:00:37.102
They've all answered for their crimes
and now it's your turn.

01:00:37.202 --> 01:00:39.471
My judgment won't come from you.

01:00:39.571 --> 01:00:43.074
You are wicked.
You've brought harm unto your fellow man.

01:00:43.174 --> 01:00:46.945
You're not right with God.
You mustn't this.

01:00:47.045 --> 01:00:50.148
If we confess our sins, he is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins

01:00:50.248 --> 01:00:52.350
and to cleanse us
from all unrighteousness.

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:55.453
Repent, then, and turn to God,

01:00:55.553 --> 01:00:57.789
so that your sins may be wiped out!

01:00:57.889 --> 01:01:01.893
- Slow down, Red State!
- ...dominion of darkness

01:01:01.993 --> 01:01:04.963
- Jesus!
- Jackie!

01:01:05.063 --> 01:01:07.801
They told us everything.

01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:17.123
They all had a choice to take the money.

01:01:35.159 --> 01:01:38.296
Jackie, what money?

01:01:38.396 --> 01:01:42.133
- I've made my peace.
- Well, we haven't made ours.

01:01:42.233 --> 01:01:46.738
Don't be afraid, for I am with you.
Don't be discouraged, for I am your God.

01:01:46.838 --> 01:01:51.343
See all your enemies lie there,
confused and humiliated!

01:01:51.443 --> 01:01:54.846
I don't think solitary confinement
had the effect you were looking for.

01:01:54.946 --> 01:01:57.048
<i>I feel that...</i>

01:01:57.148 --> 01:01:59.715
<i>that these ladies have been tainted.</i>

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:34.600
Are you listening to me, you cunt?

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.402
Who did they get money from?

01:02:51.502 --> 01:02:53.768
I helped them!

01:02:55.906 --> 01:02:58.243
- Let her go!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:02:58.343 --> 01:03:03.562
- Lisa, don't say anything!
- Look who decides to speak up?

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:08.820
Jackie just told us
that you chose to take the money.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.221
That's what this is about?
You want our money?

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:16.409
If I tell you,
will you unplug the blow dryer?

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:20.946
Scout's honor.

01:03:22.782 --> 01:03:25.620
Jacqueline's family gave us each

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.457
$40,000 to go with the story.

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:31.926
And you took it?

01:03:32.026 --> 01:03:33.962
We voted.

01:03:34.062 --> 01:03:37.145
We sat and we voted.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:40.852
The money was insurance
to make sure that our vote stuck.

01:03:40.952 --> 01:03:42.887
Lisa, no!

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:46.691
Jacqueline concocted this whole story.

01:03:46.791 --> 01:03:49.927
Her father was there, checkbook in hand.

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:51.930
Shelby was lying.

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:54.899
Some bible thumper you are,

01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:59.671
you manipulative piece of shit!

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:03.908
My family prayed on it.

01:04:04.008 --> 01:04:07.645
We were just trying to make
a bad situation a little bit better.

01:04:07.745 --> 01:04:10.047
You can't die soon enough.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.817
I'm absolved of my sins.

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:15.320
I'm ready to meet my maker.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.989
Shut up! Shut up!

01:04:18.389 --> 01:04:23.375
I hate her just as much as you do
but she does not deserve to die!

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:27.245
I couldn't go to jail!

01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:38.223
Corey, unplug the blow dryer right now!

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:55.073
Look at those big titties.

01:04:55.526 --> 01:04:59.611
I'm Brandon. I'm a douchebag!

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.102
That's nice.

01:05:04.202 --> 01:05:07.285
Vibrant red because you're worth it.

01:05:08.772 --> 01:05:13.592
Slut! I know you like sluts, Brandon,
but how does it feel to be one?

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:17.296
Here.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.453
You think you're going to make
the news again, Jackie?

01:05:22.553 --> 01:05:25.490
- Which one of you has my cell phone?
- We smashed it!

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:27.998
Corey has mine.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:30.494
Call the police.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.411
Dial!

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:38.836
If I call the police, I'm going to have
to tell them about your daddy, Jackie.

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:41.172
My father's a good man.

01:05:41.272 --> 01:05:45.109
I'm not so sure your Christian convincing
will be seen the same by the public.

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:49.013
They'll see it more as a guilty girl's dad
who bought the silence of five other girls;

01:05:49.113 --> 01:05:51.816
framing us in order to save
his precious little daughter.

01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:54.419
How holy! Praise the Lord!

01:05:54.519 --> 01:05:56.887
The church will stand true.

01:05:56.987 --> 01:06:00.678
Or they'll turn on him when they learn
how dishonest he is.

01:06:00.778 --> 01:06:03.427
"What else is he hiding?" they'll whisper.

01:06:03.527 --> 01:06:06.931
Are there little boys
in the church basement after dark?

01:06:07.031 --> 01:06:10.435
Where did all this payoff money
come from on a pastor's salary?

01:06:10.535 --> 01:06:13.938
Has the collection plate
been a little bit light?

01:06:14.038 --> 01:06:17.575
- Think about it, Jackie.
- Stop talking and call the police!

01:06:17.675 --> 01:06:20.154
- Maybe we shouldn't call.
- What else are we going to do?

01:06:20.254 --> 01:06:22.794
But my father!

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:26.750
Dial.

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:31.037
Please don't!
I'll give you anything you want!

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:37.099
I'm having trouble remembering.
It's nine, one...

01:06:37.895 --> 01:06:41.299
- then what?
- This is my final warning.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:46.618
Bitch!

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:53.391
Jackie! I just want to let you
know that I forgive you.

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.227
Really?

01:07:00.024 --> 01:07:01.725
Corey!

01:07:01.825 --> 01:07:03.675
Fuck!

01:07:05.529 --> 01:07:07.050
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:10.507
Don't worry, the sting starts
to wear off after two years.

01:07:14.606 --> 01:07:18.143
- What the fuck?
- She broke my foot!

01:07:18.643 --> 01:07:21.112
Monitor room, red button now!

01:07:21.212 --> 01:07:23.363
It seals the entrance,
it's the only way out!

01:07:48.005 --> 01:07:51.022
Red button. Red button.

01:07:52.075 --> 01:07:53.692
Fuck!

01:07:58.116 --> 01:07:59.965
Come on!

01:08:02.786 --> 01:08:05.637
Red button, where the fuck is it?

01:08:10.362 --> 01:08:13.573
Goddamn it, Elaina! Fuck!

01:08:16.501 --> 01:08:18.350
Fuck!

01:08:22.957 --> 01:08:25.532
Help me! Help me!

01:08:27.577 --> 01:08:30.095
She's trying to kill me!

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.930
Stay away from me!

01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:09.121
Stay away!

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.737
Please!

01:09:13.057 --> 01:09:15.840
I'm sorry. I'm sorr...

01:09:34.243 --> 01:09:36.461
Red button.

01:09:37.314 --> 01:09:39.131
Whatever.

01:10:00.972 --> 01:10:02.588
All right.

01:10:06.978 --> 01:10:10.982
We're not getting sentimental. We agreed.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:13.098
Screw it!

01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:16.835
Thank you so much for being my friend.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:49.146
I couldn't have pulled this off
without you.

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:57.927
I'm ready.

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:51.215
- May the best slut win.
- Loser first.

01:11:51.315 --> 01:11:53.832
I never lose, bitch.

01:11:59.222 --> 01:12:01.407
Bye-bye, Brandon. See you on the internet.

01:12:42.366 --> 01:12:44.516
I'll miss you.

01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:16.341
Help!
