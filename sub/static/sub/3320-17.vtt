WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:05.701
Mom, you'’re going
to college now, right?

00:05.788 --> 00:07.311
Yes, I am, sweetie.

00:07.398 --> 00:09.139
Can you take
cooking classes there?

00:11.576 --> 00:14.318
I thought you liked
my tuna casserole.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.625
It was better
when you made it drunk.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.934
Roscoe, I made it
when she was drunk.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.806
Oh.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.242
Mystery solved.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.072
Sorry... [grunts]

00:29.159 --> 00:31.074
You would not believe

00:31.161 --> 00:33.859
what I snaked out of old lady
Gorman'’s shower drain.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.035
Mom, please.
We'’re eating dinner.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.037
And it'’s hard enough.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.039
Fine.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.477
A hairball
with a human tooth in it.

00:45.654 --> 00:46.829
I'’m gonna go do my homework.

00:46.916 --> 00:49.049
Congratulations.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.747
You managed to gross out a boy
who keeps his boogers in a jar.

00:53.575 --> 00:54.706
I need to get going, too.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.882
Where you headed?

00:56.969 --> 00:59.537
I'’m going to a birthday party
with Gregory.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.974
Oh, Gregory... again.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.019
Wow, that'’s been going on
a little while now, huh?

01:04.107 --> 01:05.194
I guess.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.892
When do we get to meet him?

01:06.979 --> 01:08.851
Yeah, I'’d like to
meet young Gregory.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.549
Yeah, I just don'’t see
any reason for that.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.638
Oh, come on!

01:13.725 --> 01:15.901
There'’s nothing to hide.

01:15.988 --> 01:18.034
Your last boyfriend was
a burger-flipping stoner

01:18.121 --> 01:21.385
who got you pregnant--
the bar is very low.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.605
Why are you so interested
in my life?

01:23.692 --> 01:25.389
Are your own lives that boring?

01:25.476 --> 01:27.348
Yes. The most exciting thing
that happened to me today

01:27.435 --> 01:29.263
was a hairball with an overbite.

01:30.786 --> 01:31.874
Come on!

01:31.961 --> 01:32.875
Tell me about him.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.181
I'’m a cool mom.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.444
I'’m hip, I'’m happening.

01:36.531 --> 01:39.055
I got it going on.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.970
How were you ever a stripper?

01:43.842 --> 01:47.150
Some men enjoyed my awkwardness.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.587
Come on, what'’s
the deal with this guy?

01:49.674 --> 01:51.285
Does he have, like,
a misshapen head?

01:51.372 --> 01:53.852
Little tiny legs?
Lazy eye? Canadian...?

01:53.939 --> 01:56.159
"Canadian"?

01:56.246 --> 01:58.205
That'’s the border
we should be watching.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.251
He'’s just a guy.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.035
Where'’d you meet him?At school.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.298
So, he'’s a student.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.560
God! What is with you guys?

02:05.647 --> 02:07.083
Just... leave it alone.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.824
He'’s not a student.

02:08.911 --> 02:10.217
Violet, you know
the kind of men

02:10.304 --> 02:11.914
your grandmother
and I have dated.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.959
We are the last people
in the world to judge.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.265
Am I right?Mm, absolutely.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.267
You cannot shock us.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.660
All right.

02:18.747 --> 02:20.705
He'’s a professor at my school.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.055
And he'’s 42 years old.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.932
I'’m calling the police.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.213
Mom, I'’m 19.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.345
No one'’s doing anything wrong.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.911
Hang up the phone.

02:52.998 --> 02:56.045
Then why were you
hiding this from us?

02:56.132 --> 02:58.395
Because I was afraid
you might not handle it well.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.571
Why would you think that?
My little girl is dating

03:00.658 --> 03:02.704
a man who'’s old enough
to be her father.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.793
Why would that upset me?
It'’s just Jim friggin'’ Dandy!

03:06.142 --> 03:07.274
Pssst!

03:07.361 --> 03:08.884
You'’re not handling it well.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.757
I'’m out of here.

03:12.844 --> 03:14.237
I don'’t believe it.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.196
42 years old?

03:16.283 --> 03:19.416
It'’d be less weird if
youwere dating him.

03:19.503 --> 03:20.939
Look, I haven'’t seen him,
but if you want me

03:21.026 --> 03:22.898
to take a run at him, I will.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.816
Really not in the mood, Mom.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.340
It could be a lot worse.
Could be one of the losers

03:30.427 --> 03:33.038
you dragged home
when you were a teenager.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.606
He'’s old enough to be one of
the losers I dragged home.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.260
Yeah.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.044
Look, the more a mother
fights a daughter

03:39.131 --> 03:40.524
on who she chooses
for a boyfriend,

03:40.611 --> 03:41.786
the more she'’ll run to him.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.266
How do you know that?

03:43.353 --> 03:46.922
I point to your two children.

03:47.009 --> 03:49.838
And in the spirit of fairness,
I point to you, too.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.672
[sighs]
Oh, God.

04:00.022 --> 04:03.460
Relax. I just wanted
to apologize.

04:03.547 --> 04:04.461
Really?

04:04.548 --> 04:06.333
Come here, sit down.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.812
Can we just do this
in the morning?

04:07.899 --> 04:09.510
Damn it, Violet, sit down!

04:10.728 --> 04:13.949
Please...?

04:15.733 --> 04:17.168
Listen,

04:17.257 --> 04:20.041
it'’s natural that I worry

04:20.129 --> 04:23.001
some guy might be taking
advantage of you.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.481
Where'’s the apology?

04:24.568 --> 04:26.440
It'’s coming.

04:26.527 --> 04:27.615
Better come soon.

04:27.702 --> 04:30.139
One sec.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.362
[glass shattering]

04:35.449 --> 04:38.147
Anyway...

04:40.062 --> 04:43.021
...you and I both know

04:43.108 --> 04:45.067
that I wasn'’t
always there for you,

04:45.154 --> 04:47.199
so you got to forgive me

04:47.287 --> 04:50.202
for being a little
overprotective now.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.379
I get it.You do?

04:52.466 --> 04:54.119
Gregory explained
all this to me.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.078
He'’s a psychology
professor.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.602
He actually did his doctoral
thesis on the damaging effects

04:58.689 --> 05:00.430
of alcoholism on families,

05:00.517 --> 05:03.172
so he gets that part, too.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.481
Well, isn'’t that just super.

05:07.568 --> 05:11.398
Oh, hey, what
are you guys doing up?

05:11.485 --> 05:14.226
Oh, give me a break.
I heard you breathing up there.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.707
Great, then I can
jump right in.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.927
Why don'’t we invite Gregory
over for dinner?

05:19.014 --> 05:20.885
Oh, no. He knows
I grew up in the circus,

05:20.972 --> 05:22.887
he doesn'’t need
to meet the clowns.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.759
Honey, I promise,

05:24.846 --> 05:26.848
your mom and I will
be on our best behavior.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.459
We'’ll make him
feel really welcome.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.896
Well, he did say
he'’d like to meet you.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.594
That'’s a good sign.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.552
You'’ll see.
He'’s a terrific guy

05:35.639 --> 05:37.728
and I think he really
cares for me.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.513
I'’m sure he does.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.430
Which brings up
the question:

05:43.517 --> 05:45.954
Where are you
in the relationship?

05:46.041 --> 05:49.087
What'’s that supposed to mean?Are you plankin'’ him?

05:49.174 --> 05:51.438
I'’m not talking
about this with you.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.744
They'’re plankin'’.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.572
I'’m going to bed now.

05:55.659 --> 05:58.053
Okay, but we'’re gonna
do the dinner, right?

05:58.140 --> 05:59.446
Depends. Who'’s cooking?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.926
She'’ll cook.I'’ll cook.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.799
All right, I'’ll set it up.
Night.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.235
Night.Night.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.932
I still never
got my apology.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.891
Sorry.Too late.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.765
Shall we?Ugh.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.767
I can'’t go to bed after that.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.290
The second I close my eyes

06:18.378 --> 06:19.770
I'’ll be picturing
Richard Dreyfuss

06:19.857 --> 06:22.207
showering with my daughter.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.122
Thanks.

06:24.209 --> 06:26.081
Now I'’m not sleeping either.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.040
Ugh.
Ooh.

06:31.260 --> 06:34.481
Wow, so he'’s
older than me?Yup.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.614
Man, I don'’t know whether to
be disgusted or impressed.

06:37.701 --> 06:38.963
You'’re disgusted.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.618
I can be both.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.794
Do we have four
matching dinner plates?

06:43.881 --> 06:45.405
That'’s what
you'’re worried about?

06:45.492 --> 06:47.407
Your kids don'’t
have matching fathers.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.411
Mind if I stick around
and meet him?

06:51.498 --> 06:52.934
Yeah, actually, I do.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.588
Take the kid
that is yours and go.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.503
Whatever.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.635
All right, let'’s hit it.

06:58.722 --> 06:59.984
[laughing]

07:00.071 --> 07:01.203
Oh...

07:02.378 --> 07:04.424
Hey!

07:06.077 --> 07:08.123
Hey, Baxter.
This is Gregory.

07:08.210 --> 07:11.953
Gregory, this is my little
brother Roscoe and Roscoe'’s dad.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.303
Hi.Hi, nice to meet you.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.914
Nice to meet you, too.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.006
Okay.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.182
We'’ll be on our way.

07:24.269 --> 07:27.316
Oh, just a heads up--
as Violet'’s former stepfather,

07:27.403 --> 07:28.578
I'’m keeping my eye on you.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.146
But as a bystanding dude,

07:31.233 --> 07:33.104
I tip my cap.

07:35.672 --> 07:39.154
Let'’s go.You'’re not
wearing a cap.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.199
Not her usual type.

07:41.286 --> 07:44.855
Looks like her usual type'’s
parole officer.

07:44.942 --> 07:47.641
It'’s still not too late to run.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.469
[laughs]
I'’m fine.

07:49.556 --> 07:50.687
Where can I hang this?

07:50.774 --> 07:52.428
The closet'’s back there,

07:52.515 --> 07:53.995
but that'’s where
my little brother sleeps.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.345
What?

07:56.432 --> 07:58.695
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

07:58.782 --> 08:01.655
Welcome.Welcome.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.657
Yeah, okay.

08:03.744 --> 08:07.095
Mom, Grandma, this is Gregory.

08:07.182 --> 08:09.010
Oh, it is so nice
to meet you.

08:09.097 --> 08:10.272
Nice to meet you, too.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.752
Please, sit down.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.884
Thanks.Would you like a glass of wine?

08:13.971 --> 08:16.365
Really? You keep wine
in the house?

08:16.452 --> 08:18.889
We don'’t drink, but we got
a nice Chardonnay for you.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.108
Thanks, I'’ll have a glass.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.892
Me, too.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.503
Oh, honey, you'’re not
old enough to drink.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.374
She'’s not old
enough to drink.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.551
Why don'’t I get the booze?

08:28.638 --> 08:30.901
So, uh,

08:30.988 --> 08:33.687
Violet tells us you teach
at the junior college.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.905
Yes, I do. Psychology.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.952
Well, then we have
something in common.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.780
I'’m a certified life coach.

08:39.866 --> 08:42.652
C... Certified?
Oh, that'’s fabulous,

08:42.739 --> 08:44.261
because, you know,
there are so many

08:44.349 --> 08:47.570
fly-by-night life coaches.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.093
Hey, Gregory?
You didn'’t happen

08:49.180 --> 08:51.531
to bring your own
corkscrew, did you?

08:55.360 --> 08:58.102
So after my mom
had the stroke,

08:58.189 --> 09:00.888
I took a year off of grad school
to take care of her,

09:00.975 --> 09:03.586
which I thought
was gonna be hard,

09:03.673 --> 09:05.109
uh, but it turned
into this

09:05.196 --> 09:07.634
wonderful experience, because

09:07.721 --> 09:10.027
we got to know each other
as adults.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.899
And that was

09:11.986 --> 09:13.770
a priceless gift.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.598
That'’s beautiful.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.558
She would never
do that for me.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.082
She'’s right.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.605
Well, this was fun.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.259
I'’m gonna grab our coats.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.957
Oh, so soon?

09:27.044 --> 09:29.264
You wanted to meet him,
you met him, now say good-bye.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.267
Uh, be right there.

09:32.354 --> 09:35.487
Listen, I just want to say...

09:35.575 --> 09:37.925
I get that you have your
misgivings about me.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.883
If I was in your
position, I would feel

09:39.970 --> 09:41.798
the exact same way.

09:41.885 --> 09:44.409
But you have to know
I wasn'’t looking for this.

09:44.496 --> 09:45.672
I'’m not the guy

09:45.759 --> 09:47.021
who dates younger women.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.153
But we just...

09:49.240 --> 09:51.373
made a connection.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.941
And I want to reassure you

09:54.028 --> 09:57.379
that I care deeply
about Violet.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.904
Okay, well,
thank you.Yeah, okay.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.125
You ready?

10:04.212 --> 10:06.127
Yeah.Oh, uh,

10:06.214 --> 10:07.911
why don'’t you
take the wine,

10:07.998 --> 10:10.958
since we can'’t drink it.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.047
Or open it.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.658
Thanks again,
this was really great.

10:15.745 --> 10:16.833
Good night.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.879
CHRISTY:
Bye.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.839
[door closes]

10:22.926 --> 10:25.363
I have a terrible
confession to make.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.061
What?[sighs]

10:27.148 --> 10:30.325
I like him better
than I like her.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.632
I like him better
than I like you.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.381
Seriously?
You left me a to-do list?

10:43.468 --> 10:45.122
I'’ve got an hour
to do my homework

10:45.209 --> 10:47.081
before I run to the restaurant.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.692
Who else is gonna vacuum, clean
the bathroom, sort the laundry?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.041
Hey, I'’m not your wife.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.217
You sure about that?

10:53.304 --> 10:55.176
I go out there
and earn a living,

10:55.263 --> 10:57.526
we sleep in the same bed
and don'’t have sex.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.660
Maybe I am your wife.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.751
I'’m not staying.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.143
What do you mean
you'’re not staying?

11:06.230 --> 11:07.754
I haven'’t seen you for a week.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.756
Yeah, well,
after I grab a few of my things,

11:09.843 --> 11:11.148
you won'’t see me
for another week.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.760
[sighs]

11:16.197 --> 11:17.720
You'’re just gonna stand there?

11:17.807 --> 11:19.461
You'’re not gonna say anything?

11:19.548 --> 11:21.811
Hey, you'’re the man
of the house.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.078
So, what'’s the deal?

11:28.165 --> 11:29.906
You living with
Professor Higgins now?

11:29.993 --> 11:31.386
His last name is Munchnik.

11:31.473 --> 11:32.604
[with British accent]:
By George,

11:32.692 --> 11:34.389
she doesn'’t get the reference.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.608
Violet, I just want to
know what'’s going on.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.437
You'’ve been spending a
lot of time over there.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.439
Why wouldn'’t I?
His condo'’s great.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.398
Plus, he'’s got a gym
in the building

11:43.485 --> 11:45.095
and underground parking.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.097
Oh, and he has a housekeeper.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.926
We have a housekeeper.

11:50.013 --> 11:53.843
Careful or you'’re sleeping
on the couch tonight.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.106
And you also
really like him, right?

11:56.193 --> 11:57.368
Um,

11:57.455 --> 11:59.327
yeah, he'’s cool.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.633
Honey, you don'’t live
with a guy because he'’s cool.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.984
You live with him because
you have feelings for him.

12:04.071 --> 12:06.595
Is that what you guys did
when you were my age?

12:06.682 --> 12:08.379
She always goes to that.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.468
It is the smart play.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.949
Sweetheart, I'’m...

12:13.036 --> 12:14.255
I'’m just
a little worried that...

12:14.342 --> 12:16.300
Mom, relax.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.781
We'’re just having fun,
and Gregory is crazy about me.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.652
I know heis,

12:20.740 --> 12:22.959
but I want to hear that
you'’re crazy about him, too,

12:23.046 --> 12:25.092
that you'’re not settling.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.442
Fine. I'’m crazy about him.
He'’s the man of my dreams.

12:27.529 --> 12:28.704
See you later.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.188
[sighs]

12:34.275 --> 12:37.452
Wow. You and I are more
in love than they are.

12:40.411 --> 12:43.545
I gotta tell ya...
I miss Violet being here,

12:43.632 --> 12:47.201
but I swear I'’ve gotten taller
since she moved out.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.029
That'’s because you'’re
not hunched over.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.074
You'’re not walking scared.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.511
You know what I noticed?
Ever since she left,

12:53.598 --> 12:55.644
my bowels have gone
from irritable to delightful.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.083
Just so nice to have a
break from her sneering mug

13:00.170 --> 13:02.520
looking at me across
the dinner table.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.696
All because
you committed the terrible sin

13:04.784 --> 13:07.047
of asking how her day was.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.005
It'’s kind of like this, right?

13:11.878 --> 13:13.880
That'’s good.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.621
She always looks like
she smells something bad.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.843
[laughs]

13:20.930 --> 13:22.366
Don'’t get me wrong.
I love her.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.847
Oh, I love her, too.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.807
But it feels like
some sort of demonic spirit

13:27.894 --> 13:30.070
has been exorcised
from the apartment.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.941
And we didn'’t even need
a Catholic priest.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.814
Turns out we needed
a Jewish psychology professor.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.511
L'’chaim.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.605
[sighs contentedly]

13:43.692 --> 13:46.695
You know, it just occurred to me
that her bedroom'’s empty.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.392
That'’s true.

13:48.479 --> 13:51.526
So, what are we doing here?

13:51.613 --> 13:54.007
You'’re right. Get down there.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.356
You get down there.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.661
I like having my own bathroom.

13:56.748 --> 13:57.793
I'’ll flip you for it.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.972
I don'’t trust
that commemorative coin.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.979
[quietly]:
Oh, damn it.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.118
Move over.
What happened?

14:18.205 --> 14:20.033
Roscoe'’s smarter
than both of us.

14:23.340 --> 14:26.039
He didn'’t give any hints
over the phone?

14:26.126 --> 14:28.563
No, just said
it was important,

14:28.650 --> 14:32.088
and he wanted to
talk to us in person.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.961
You don'’t think he wants
to return Violet, do you?

14:35.048 --> 14:37.615
Doesn'’t matter.
He'’s had her for 30 days.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.574
We don'’t have
to take her back.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.754
All right, well, let'’s go
hear what he has to say.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.582
Stand up straight.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.196
Here we go.
[gentle laugh]

14:53.283 --> 14:54.937
This really wasn'’t necessary.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.418
Don'’t be silly.
You'’re Violet'’s boyfriend.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.768
Right?

14:59.855 --> 15:01.726
Right.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.511
[clears throat]

15:05.556 --> 15:08.646
So, what did you want
to talk about?

15:08.733 --> 15:12.259
Well, you both know
how amazing Violet is.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.440
Sure.
Okay.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.572
So it'’ll come
as no surprise to you

15:21.659 --> 15:25.011
when I tell you
how much I love her.

15:25.098 --> 15:27.491
We love her, too.Yeah, we love her.

15:27.578 --> 15:31.104
And the reason I wanted
to speak with you guys was

15:31.191 --> 15:33.497
to get your blessing.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.456
I'’d like to marry your daughter.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.808
BOTH:
Is she pregnant?

15:39.895 --> 15:42.158
No!

15:42.245 --> 15:44.856
Then why do you want
to marry her?

15:44.944 --> 15:45.945
Mom!

15:46.032 --> 15:47.685
[clears her throat]

15:47.772 --> 15:49.687
Sorry. You kind of
caught us off guard.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.907
It'’s okay.
I know it'’s sudden.

15:51.994 --> 15:55.389
Um, before we
give our blessing,

15:55.476 --> 15:57.260
I just have
one question.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.306
Really? I have eight.

16:01.743 --> 16:05.834
Do you understand what it means
to be a 19-year-old girl?

16:05.921 --> 16:09.577
How... unformed her thinking is?

16:09.664 --> 16:12.406
That'’s one of the things
I love about her.

16:12.493 --> 16:15.626
She'’s not jaded, she sees
the world with fresh eyes.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.673
Wait'’ll you see those eyes when
you drink the last Diet Snapple.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.416
Don'’t worry.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.418
I'’ll never do anything
to upset her.

16:24.505 --> 16:28.248
Oh, if only that
were possible.

16:28.335 --> 16:32.382
So, do I take that as a "yes,"
I have your permission?

16:32.469 --> 16:35.255
Gregory, I appreciate
you coming to us,

16:35.342 --> 16:37.300
but it'’s really
not our call.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.564
Yeah, Violet might not be as
ready to settle down as you are.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.393
I hear you.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.353
I just can'’t help
the way I feel.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.051
I'’m desperately in love.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.401
Oh, you poor bastard.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.360
Bring it in.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.669
ROSCOE:
No, I got here first.
It'’s myroom.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.281
CHRISTY:
Okay, here'’s a fun idea.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.892
What if we put a tent
in the living room,

17:03.979 --> 17:06.155
and you could pretend
you'’re camping every night?

17:06.242 --> 17:08.114
ROSCOE:
What am I, seven?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.685
[chuckling]:
That was pathetic.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.602
What'’s pathetic is I
have to return a tent.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.039
[laughing]

17:21.692 --> 17:22.911
Hey.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.565
Hey.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.262
What brings you by?

17:26.348 --> 17:28.263
I needed to talk to you guys.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.571
About?

17:30.658 --> 17:33.791
Last night at dinner,
Gregory proposed to me.

17:33.878 --> 17:37.404
Yeah, he mentioned
he might do that.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.188
What did you say?

17:39.275 --> 17:40.668
Did you let
him down easy?

17:40.755 --> 17:43.932
Well, I was going to...

17:44.019 --> 17:47.066
but then he showed me this
awesome ring, and I said "yes!"

17:51.200 --> 17:55.248
I am going be
Mrs. Gregory Munchnik.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.775
Hello?

18:02.211 --> 18:03.517
Your daughter just got engaged.

18:03.604 --> 18:04.953
This is good news.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.607
Yeah, sure, it'’s good...

18:06.694 --> 18:07.782
[clears her throat]

18:07.869 --> 18:09.131
...if this is what you want.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.612
Why wouldn'’t it be?

18:11.699 --> 18:14.789
God, my housekeeper was happier
for me than you two are.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.704
Honey, this
is a big step.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.272
We just want to know that
you'’ve thought this through.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.491
Yeah, is this the guy
you'’re gonna be with forever?

18:21.578 --> 18:23.580
Well, I doubt it'’ll be forever,

18:23.667 --> 18:26.714
but for a first marriage,
he'’s pretty perfect.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.545
Come here.
[clears her throat]

18:31.632 --> 18:33.851
I'’m just worried

18:33.938 --> 18:37.028
you'’re marrying a man
you'’re not really in love with.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.466
Were you in love
with Baxter or my dad?

18:39.553 --> 18:41.032
Yes.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.904
And how did that
work out for you?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.127
Sometimes I just
hate this kid.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.696
Violet, marriage
is hard enough

18:52.783 --> 18:54.655
when you'’re desperately
in love with each other

18:54.742 --> 18:56.961
and you think it'’s
never gonna end,

18:57.048 --> 19:00.182
but going into it knowing
it'’s doomed is just so...

19:00.269 --> 19:01.401
Realistic?

19:01.488 --> 19:04.012
I was gonna say "sad."

19:04.099 --> 19:06.275
What is so bad about this?

19:06.362 --> 19:10.279
I have someone who loves me
and wants to take care of me,

19:10.366 --> 19:11.976
and it'’s good for you guys

19:12.063 --> 19:14.370
because I'’m no longer
a problem for you anymore.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.198
Violet, you were never
a problem.

19:16.285 --> 19:19.897
Yeah, we say all the time
how much we love you.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.899
There'’s the face.
There'’s the face.

19:24.598 --> 19:27.296
Trust me, I know
what I'’m doing.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.085
[sighs]

19:34.173 --> 19:36.131
Oh, God.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.089
You have to let
her live her life.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.874
She'’s a grown woman.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.397
VIOLET:
Mom!

19:41.484 --> 19:45.793
Roscoe threw out
all my teddy bears!

19:45.880 --> 19:48.361
Now we know what to get her
as a wedding gift.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.198
Whatcha doin'’?

19:59.285 --> 20:01.156
Working on my
dating profile.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.636
eHarmony? Match?

20:02.723 --> 20:04.203
Senior-Mingle.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.509
You'’re kidding.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.076
Maybe Violet'’s on to something.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.078
Oh, God,
you can'’t be that desperate.

20:10.165 --> 20:11.775
Check out some
of these old dudes.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.342
This one'’s 82 years old.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.039
He'’s got a beach house
in Hawaii,

20:15.126 --> 20:16.998
a brownstone in San
Francisco, and look here--

20:17.085 --> 20:18.695
under special skills:

20:18.782 --> 20:20.306
"Can drive at night."

20:20.393 --> 20:21.698
[laughs]

20:21.785 --> 20:23.526
Slide over.

20:23.613 --> 20:24.962
I'’m gonna give him a poke.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.835
Careful you don'’t
break his hip.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.880
Ooh! Take a look
at this silver fox.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.404
Mm.

20:31.491 --> 20:33.884
22,000 square foot
home in Carmel.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.365
"Enjoys short walks
on the beach."
[laughs]

20:38.846 --> 20:41.457
Ah, just so we'’re clear,
you'’re giving up on love?

20:41.544 --> 20:43.938
I'’ve had love.
I want a housekeeper.
