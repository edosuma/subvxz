WEBVTT

00:04.238 --> 00:06.474
Previously on E.R.:

00:06.474 --> 00:07.808
I saw Charlie Pratt
at Ceasefire.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.577
He said he stopped
by here last week.

00:09.577 --> 00:10.611
How'd it go?

00:10.611 --> 00:11.712
Quick.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.814
Did the oncologist
you spoke with

00:13.814 --> 00:16.184
mention anything about
prophylactic surgery?

00:16.184 --> 00:17.785
You mean having
my breasts removed?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.053
There have been
a lot of advances

00:19.053 --> 00:20.154
in reconstructive surgery

00:20.154 --> 00:21.789
and you need
to protect yourself.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.058
Can you promise me that giving
up my breasts would protect me?

00:24.058 --> 00:25.459
I had my annual
PSA screening.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.128
Needle biopsy showed

00:27.128 --> 00:28.429
a moderately differentiated
prostate cancer.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.797
I'm so sorry.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.633
Does this hurt, Blaire?
She's in a coma, Inez.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.402
Not anymore.
What's the last thing
you remember?

00:34.402 --> 00:36.270
Were we in an accident?

00:41.609 --> 00:43.677
WEAVER:
...The reason I'm calling,
Dr. Clemente,

00:43.677 --> 00:44.845
is that, according to my notes,

00:44.845 --> 00:46.547
you were supposed
to start today.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.582
So unless your plane went down
or you got hit by a bus,

00:48.582 --> 00:51.119
you'd better get in here
as soon as you get this message.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.120
Hey...

00:52.120 --> 00:53.187
Luka, I need you to wait.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.288
Pratt's running behind;

00:54.288 --> 00:55.256
the new attending's
a no-show.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.857
It's his first day.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.426
You'd think he'd want to make
a good impression.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.460
WEAVER:
You never did.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.561
KOVACS:
I have to go.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.230
Page me
if he doesn't show up.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.664
??

01:03.664 --> 01:05.633
See if we can find
someone to come in.

01:05.633 --> 01:06.667
LOCKHART:
Whoa!

01:06.667 --> 01:07.835
Where are you
rushing off to?

01:07.835 --> 01:09.137
I have to go upstairs.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.339
Why?
Uh, never mind.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.840
Last time
I reached out to someone,

01:12.840 --> 01:14.808
Dubenko tried to make me
his concubine.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.845
Ah, hello, my people.

01:17.845 --> 01:18.846
You're late.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.548
Not according to me.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.550
Yeah, according to me--
I got 20 patients on the rack.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.585
Chest pain,
I need a monitored bed!

01:24.585 --> 01:25.853
LOCKHART:
We don't have one.
Do a 12-lead in the hallway.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.355
Is Dr. Lewis coming in?

01:27.355 --> 01:29.523
Dr. Lewis is never
coming in again.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.495
She took a tenure track
position in Iowa City.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.496
Just like that?

01:35.496 --> 01:37.231
Just like that.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.666
That's why Dr. Clemente
is supposed to be here now.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.368
Who's this
Clemente guy, anyway?

01:40.368 --> 01:42.636
He was Residency Director
at Jacobi in the Bronx,

01:42.636 --> 01:44.638
then did a stint
in Newark.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.307
Is he gonna be the
new department chief?

01:46.307 --> 01:47.708
We're forming
a search committee.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.243
The guy wouldn't be here

01:49.243 --> 01:50.544
if he wasn't angling for it,
right?

01:50.544 --> 01:52.580
WEAVER:
Abby, vomiting blood.
My favorite.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.814
Ray, nosebleed...

01:53.814 --> 01:55.483
Sorry, I'm on
my tox elective.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.750
I was just
rolling down here

01:56.750 --> 01:59.453
to remind everybody
about my gig tonight.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.521
The Pogo Lounge?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.556
Isn't that a strip club?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.925
It's behind the Lava Lounge,
which used to be called
the Aqua Lounge.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.427
Roomie, you gonna come?

02:06.427 --> 02:08.461
It's why I wake up
in the morning.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.198
MORRIS:
Okay, med students.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.732
Burning urination.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.933
Seafood allergy.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.202
We're not really doctors.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.269
That never
stopped Morris.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.604
Roswell and Marshall
are pre-med.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.406
They're collecting data
for my grant,

02:18.406 --> 02:19.907
tracking patient through-put
time.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.575
Well, if we don't start
moving the meat,

02:21.575 --> 02:22.776
they're gonna be unemployed.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.545
You want me to supervise
everyone else

02:24.545 --> 02:25.713
and take on three
new patients?

02:25.713 --> 02:27.415
You're an R-4,
stop whining.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.716
And where you going?

02:28.716 --> 02:31.252
The Weaver Lounge,
to work on my presentation.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.654
Anything short of a meteor
crash, don't bug me.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.224
TAGGART:
I need a doctor now!

02:36.224 --> 02:37.625
EKG looks good.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.261
All right.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.662
Where's your pain, sir?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.464
It's not a pain.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.466
I... I just feel
something right here.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.700
BP 124 over 78.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.236
What's it feel like?

02:48.236 --> 02:49.637
Just feels really heavy,
like a boulder.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.671
I can't breathe, Doc.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.240
Say no more.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.941
Sir, would you do me a favor
and open up?

02:53.941 --> 02:57.578
Yo... yo, I did two lines
of coke last night.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.680
What?!
And a bottle of tequila.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.251
You did?!
Not to mention three Viagra.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.852
Why didn't you
say something?

03:04.852 --> 03:07.321
Aren't you supposed to take
my history?

03:07.321 --> 03:08.689
Who are you?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.758
Victor Clemente.
Your new attending.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.494
And congratulations, Doc,
you just killed me.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.812 --> 04:06.780
Usually, Dr. Pratt
is very thorough.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.416
Look, we're
getting slammed.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.950
It's okay;
death becomes me.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.452
I've got a Q-and-A upstairs,

04:11.452 --> 04:12.553
but maybe I should
stay down here.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.322
No, no, go ahead.
Take it.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.723
Dr. Kevorkian and I--
we'll hold down the fort.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.757
Hey, Jerry, you know
where to find me, right?

04:17.757 --> 04:18.892
JERRY:
Mm-hmm.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.531
You know, you sure know
how to make an entrance.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.399
Just trying to get the
lay of the land, that's all.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.834
Yeah, but I think you
took it too far.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.469
You should've seen
me at St. Mary's,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.037
I took it all the
way to a rectal.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.072
She was cuter
than you, though.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.741
Oh, look at that.
Look at that.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.376
You guys still
using X-ray film?

04:35.376 --> 04:37.345
I thought everybody
was digital by now.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.779
Yeah...

04:38.779 --> 04:40.514
Oh, hey, nice job
shaving my chest hair.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.949
No problem.

04:41.949 --> 04:46.487
Now, it took 24 minutes
to get my vitals-- 24 minutes!

04:46.487 --> 04:48.422
Now, come on, I know we can
all do better than that.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.857
MORRIS:
Yes, we can.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.725
Yes, we can.
That's totally what I think.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.561
Archie Morris, chief resident.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.028
You know, usually, it takes me

04:55.028 --> 04:57.865
about ten minutes to figure out
who the kiss-ass is,

04:57.865 --> 04:59.700
but, hey, at least
we're breaking records
somewhere, huh?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.502
Now, the EKG was prompt

05:01.502 --> 05:03.771
but the resident's evaluation
was sloppy.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.439
Come on, you know
we were busy.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.540
It's always busy,
it's always chaos,

05:06.540 --> 05:07.941
it's always out of control.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.677
Look, I know you people
don't have enough hours

05:09.677 --> 05:10.911
to spend with every patient,

05:10.911 --> 05:13.847
but our job is efficiency
and excellence.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.449
We're marksmen--
we hone in

05:15.449 --> 05:16.750
on what's important,

05:16.750 --> 05:18.719
we hit our target with
one shot and we move on.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.789
We should call psych
on this guy.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.559
And who are you?

05:26.527 --> 05:28.128
Abby Lockhart. R-2.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.931
Oh, yeah; Weaver was talking
to me about you.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.468
I'd like to say it was all good,
but it wasn't.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.671
Can we start by
clearing this stuff?

05:37.671 --> 05:40.040
MORRIS:
Okay, in Trauma One,
we have...

05:40.040 --> 05:42.843
A grease board! God,
I haven't seen one of
these since the '80s.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.512
That's pretty cool.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.013
Look, unless anybody
has any objections,

05:46.013 --> 05:48.682
I prefer walking rounds.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.584
We all learn, okay?
Let's go.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.085
He's kinda hot.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.621
I thought you
had a boyfriend.

05:53.621 --> 05:56.056
He's at war
and so are my hormones.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.858
( knocking )

05:57.858 --> 05:58.892
( spits )

05:58.892 --> 06:01.028
Come in.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.796
How are you?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.432
( swallows )

06:04.432 --> 06:06.734
This toothbrush feels like
a hundred-pound weight.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.437
Well, it's normal,
after such prolonged bed rest.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.904
Please tell me

06:10.904 --> 06:12.973
you brought some Rocky Road
and a cheeseburger.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.476
Just came by to test
your muscle tone again.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.910
So, no fries?

06:16.910 --> 06:19.146
Well, at least you're
not Dr. Shulansky.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.616
He brings tours in here
like I'm some freak at
the Wild Animal Park.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.851
He's excited
that you're awake.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.454
She's alive.
She's alive.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.788
Squeeze my hand.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.126
Okay, that feels a little
stronger than last week.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.963
Try to lift up your leg.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.931
That's good.
Very good.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.505
Well, it's more than
you could do the last time.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.140
That's thanks to
three hours a day with Helga,

06:47.140 --> 06:48.942
the therapist
from hell.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.479
Oh, I see you had
some visitors.

06:51.479 --> 06:54.014
Yeah, that was my best
friend from college.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.916
I haven't seen her
since graduation.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.719
I asked her for a joint and
she brought me a teddy bear.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.787
Well, that's good
for her.

06:59.787 --> 07:00.988
The last thing you need

07:00.988 --> 07:02.523
is to take anything
that will interfere

07:02.523 --> 07:04.057
with your recovery.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.828
I need... ( chuckles )
to take the edge off.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.930
Waking up and finding out
that your mom's dead

07:09.930 --> 07:12.966
and your fiance's MIA
and you've literally

07:12.966 --> 07:15.936
slept through your 20s
is just a little stressful.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.709
( heavy sigh )

07:21.709 --> 07:24.712
Has Dr. Shulansky said anything
about the accident?

07:24.712 --> 07:27.014
All I know is you and your mom
were driving,

07:27.014 --> 07:29.683
and it was some kind of
traffic collision.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.185
Yeah, that much I remember.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.921
We were on our way
for my final fitting

07:33.921 --> 07:36.524
for my wedding dress.

07:36.524 --> 07:40.060
It was strapless...
with a tulle skirt.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.762
( giggles )

07:41.762 --> 07:44.632
I wouldn't even let
Jason see it.

07:44.632 --> 07:45.999
Your fiance?

07:45.999 --> 07:47.935
Mm-hmm.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.037
You spoken to him?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.940
Oh, that would fall
under the heading of

07:52.940 --> 07:55.576
"Scared as hell,
don't know how to do that one."

07:55.576 --> 07:57.978
( laughs )

07:57.978 --> 08:00.614
A lowered tidal volume
of six cc's per kilo

08:00.614 --> 08:03.751
decreased mortality
from 40% to 31%.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.920
You twirl a knob,
you're gonna save a life.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.222
Okay?
All right, let's go.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.891
Gracias, Doctor.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.292
Di nada, mami.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.862
Those a cool shoes, man.
Adidas?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.564
Get laid, Morris.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.165
( clearing throat ):
Boris Nadinovitz,

08:18.165 --> 08:19.967
presenting with fever,
lymphadenopathy

08:19.967 --> 08:21.935
and night sweats--
no obvious source.

08:21.935 --> 08:25.138
( speaking Russian )

08:25.138 --> 08:26.640
( Boris coughing )

08:26.640 --> 08:28.075
( replies in Russian )

08:28.075 --> 08:31.745
( speaking Russian )

08:33.013 --> 08:35.182
So what's your
diagnostic approach?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.585
Uh, skin test for TB
and Cocci, histo.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.687
CLEMENTE:
Good, good, good.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.789
( Clemente
speaks Russian )

08:42.789 --> 08:45.225
( Boris coughing )

08:45.225 --> 08:46.994
Dorsey Watson.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.662
Greg Pratt!

08:48.662 --> 08:49.897
What's up, man?
What's up?

08:49.897 --> 08:51.765
Man, what's it been,
like, five years?

08:51.765 --> 08:54.001
Uh, six. I was a second-year
when you graduated.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.603
Wow. So what are
you doing here?

08:55.603 --> 08:57.237
I work here.
What's your excuse?

08:57.237 --> 08:58.872
You know, last I heard,
you were in Winnetka,

08:58.872 --> 09:00.140
doing lipo on rich chicks.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.875
Still am, man.
Still am.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.744
One of my patients just
got a half-price tummy tuck

09:03.744 --> 09:04.812
from some hack,
landed upstairs.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.113
Ah.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.781
Hey, killer, killer,
come on, come on!

09:07.781 --> 09:10.083
We got patients to clear!
Let's go!

09:10.083 --> 09:11.151
I gotta roll, man.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.285
Hey, do your thing.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.353
I'll holla at you
before I go.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.955
Definitely.
All right.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.893
Okay, be relaxed,
try to sound calm.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.328
It'll be weird
for him at first.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.796
You think?

09:24.197 --> 09:25.666
It's ringing.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.234
Okay, take
a deep breath.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.069
( anxious laugh )

09:29.069 --> 09:30.170
What's going on?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.640
( anxious laugh )

09:32.640 --> 09:33.774
Oh... hi, uh...

09:33.774 --> 09:36.043
Is this Jason Clark's house?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.745
She's calling
her fiance.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.246
Um, Blaire Collins.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.014
I'm an old friend of his
from the Art Institute.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.149
She's doing great.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.917
I'm amazed by her progress.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.886
I been trying to help her
for over four years

09:45.886 --> 09:46.920
and, all of a sudden, this.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.289
BLAIRE:
Hi...

09:49.289 --> 09:50.991
Yeah, it's really me.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.793
What were you
treating her with?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.862
Most recently,
an experimental cocktail:

09:54.862 --> 09:57.330
Fluoxitine, sinemet
and dextroamphetamine.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.331
She still on them?

09:58.331 --> 10:00.934
Not anymore.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.936
She's asked me
about what happened.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.672
You know, how she got hurt.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.944
Um...

10:10.944 --> 10:13.747
I think it's better
not to talk to her
about it yet.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.348
Is there something
she should know?

10:15.348 --> 10:18.886
The accident was violent,
to say the least.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.922
Blaire and her mother
were carjacked;

10:21.922 --> 10:23.824
her mom was raped.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.325
And shot?

10:25.325 --> 10:27.861
Blaire tried to fight them off
and was pistol-whipped.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.130
They would've killed her, too,
but someone pulled up.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.933
But still, uh,
she has a right to know.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.234
She's in a fragile state.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.036
Telling her
could set her back.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.905
Let's get her healthy
first.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.106
She needs to hear this
at the right time,

10:39.106 --> 10:40.407
from someone close to her.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.042
She has no family.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.712
She'll be told, Doctor.
All in good time.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.682
LOCKHART:
22-year-old female,

10:48.682 --> 10:50.017
presenting with
recurring headaches.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.184
No history of migraine...

10:51.184 --> 10:52.886
Right, right--
but there is a history

10:52.886 --> 10:54.922
of ideopathic
intracranial hypertension.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.056
When I get headaches,
they usually just

10:56.056 --> 10:57.324
take out
a bunch of spinal fluid.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.358
Yeah, well, we don't
do that anymore.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.893
We don't?
No.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.929
Now that we know
that IIH is caused

11:01.929 --> 11:03.263
by sagittal sinus
thrombosis,

11:03.263 --> 11:05.032
resulting in a
decreased CSF

11:05.032 --> 11:07.034
reabsoroption at
the arachnoid sinuses.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.268
I didn't know that.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.469
Heparin is the
treatment of choice.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.438
Here you go, Doc.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.974
I'm just going to place a drop
in your eye, all right?
Lean back.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.876
Well, she still needs
an LP for diagnosis.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.778
Hey, hey, not so fast,
no so fast.

11:17.778 --> 11:21.381
Annals of Emergency Medicine,
May 2000...

11:21.381 --> 11:23.784
2000...
Five?

11:23.784 --> 11:25.485
Nope.
Three?

11:25.485 --> 11:27.420
Nope.
Four?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.156
Ten points for
the winner.

11:29.156 --> 11:32.192
Intraocular pressure correlates
with intracranial pressure.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.929
54, diagnosis made,
and you don't get a spinal tap.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.865
Abby,
Oncology's on the phone.

11:37.865 --> 11:41.068
You say he's hot again,
I'll knee-cap you.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.970
Some patient of yours
is freaking out.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.104
In Oncology?

11:44.104 --> 11:45.205
Mm-hmm.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.507
Who is it?

11:47.507 --> 11:49.777
Stephanie Lowenstein.
Double mastectomy.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.144
She's upset because
we couldn't do the
reconstruction.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.245
Why not?

11:52.245 --> 11:54.314
They found an
enlarged lymph node.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.949
We told her pathology
isn't back, but she
won't listen.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.051
She's says
it's all your fault.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.152
Stephanie...

11:59.152 --> 12:00.453
I don't want you here.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.489
I just want to help.
You call this helping?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.024
This is not helping.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.025
Okay, I understand...

12:05.025 --> 12:06.093
how you feel.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.494
You have no idea
how I feel!

12:07.494 --> 12:09.997
Please wait,
Ms. Lowenstein-- wait.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.231
We'll just have
to let the doctors

12:11.231 --> 12:12.933
get the results
back from the tests,

12:12.933 --> 12:14.034
and then we'll figure out
how to proceed.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.135
To do what?
To do what?

12:15.135 --> 12:16.269
To cut me up some more?

12:16.269 --> 12:17.504
To hell with
your damn tests!

12:17.504 --> 12:18.972
Okay, Stephanie,
listen to me, please.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.007
Just listen.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.041
You ruined me!

12:21.041 --> 12:21.975
I know you're scared.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.911
Is that what I am?

12:23.911 --> 12:26.914
Just because they found a node
doesn't mean you have cancer.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.082
I need a cab! Where's a cab?!

12:29.082 --> 12:31.551
You need to come inside
and let us treat you,
Stephanie.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.821
I had money.
Where's my stupid money?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.422
Ow!

12:35.422 --> 12:37.490
Listen to me: everything
you're feeling right
now is normal.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.926
It's just gonna take some time.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.360
I don't have time.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.829
That's not true.

12:41.829 --> 12:42.863
( stammering )

12:42.863 --> 12:44.197
Who's going to marry someone

12:44.197 --> 12:45.933
who could need chemo
for the next ten years?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.367
Who's gonna have a kid
with someone who could die

12:47.367 --> 12:49.169
before the kid
goes to high school?

12:49.169 --> 12:52.105
If they had trouble making a
diagnosis, it may not be cancer,

12:52.105 --> 12:53.841
and if it is,

12:53.841 --> 12:55.008
if it is,
because you had the surgery,

12:55.008 --> 12:56.276
they caught
it earlier.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.211
I don't believe you!
It's the truth.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.013
You did what you
had to do, and it
was incredibly brave.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.414
Then why do
I feel like this?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.250
Because it's scary.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.952
It's scary and
it's unexpected.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.319
But you don't have
to go through this alone.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.487
Get the hell away from me.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.056
Stephanie, please, please.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.390
Just-just let me take
care of those cuts.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.026
Just come inside with me
and...

13:13.026 --> 13:15.562
Stephanie, please...

13:17.865 --> 13:19.032
( sighs )

13:20.333 --> 13:23.203
I tried all
the Internet dating sites.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.138
I rewrote my profile
so many times,

13:25.138 --> 13:28.141
you would have thought
it was my thesis.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.148
Uh, what happened to Lou?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.616
I liked Lou.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.385
Ah...

13:38.385 --> 13:41.321
I don't think
he could handle this.

13:41.321 --> 13:45.058
He said he would come back
after the surgery,

13:45.058 --> 13:46.493
but...

13:48.061 --> 13:49.930
I never liked Lou.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.164
Guy's a jerk.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.133
It's a good thing
you found out early.

13:55.535 --> 13:59.539
I don't want to freeze my eggs
or buy milk on the Internet.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.209
I wanted to breast feed.

14:03.510 --> 14:08.015
This is a little
bit of Neosporin.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.384
Aren't you afraid you'll
wind up the auntie?

14:11.384 --> 14:14.554
Be forced to adopt
some kid from Cambodia?

14:14.554 --> 14:18.091
I think Cambodian
kids are cute.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.993
You know what I meant.

14:19.993 --> 14:24.231
Stephanie, if all goes well,
you'll get the reconstruction,

14:24.231 --> 14:25.465
you'll have an
uneventful recovery

14:25.465 --> 14:27.334
and lead a perfectly
normal life.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.202
That's doctor talk.
You don't get it.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.011
My mother's sister died
of breast cancer.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.213
So did my grandmother.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.384
And you?

14:45.685 --> 14:47.955
And I...

14:47.955 --> 14:51.091
have never even had a mammogram.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.160
Tony DeJesus, single stab wound
to the neck.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.561
Vitals stable.
Good airway.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.129
Hey, Tony, you having
any trouble breathing?

14:56.129 --> 14:58.098
Nah.
Time of arrival-- 14:42.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.233
Was this gang-related?
No, my old lady
stabbed me.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.401
Why'd she do that?!

15:01.401 --> 15:03.303
'Cause she's a psycho bitch.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.671
Where are my residents?
Where are my residents...?

15:04.671 --> 15:06.339
Time in treatment
room 14:43.
Got it!

15:06.339 --> 15:07.674
Who are these clowns?
You're not coming in.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.509
We're not putting
on a show for you.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.511
What the hell's wrong with you?
Get the hell out of here.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.595
The woman who answered
Jason's phone was his wife.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.165
Eh, six years is a long time.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.302
You know the thing that's
so hard about all of this

15:35.302 --> 15:37.304
is that everything
has just gone on,

15:37.304 --> 15:40.173
and I still feel like
Jason had I were just

15:40.173 --> 15:42.375
finalizing our wedding
list yesterday.

15:42.375 --> 15:46.479
I'm sure he stayed by you
as long as he could.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.381
He came by twice.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.217
Shulansky told me.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.022
No wonder he wanted us
to write our own vows.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.423
He probably planned on omitting

15:56.423 --> 15:58.358
the whole "in sickness
and in health" part.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.530
Did you want him to spend
the rest of his life

16:03.530 --> 16:06.366
hoping for something everyone
said wouldn't happen?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.479
Maybe I can be his mistress.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.647
( both chuckling )

16:25.618 --> 16:28.721
Which anatomic landmarks define
zone two of the neck?

16:28.721 --> 16:31.058
The cricoid cartilage to
the angle of the mandible.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.226
Very, very, very good.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.163
Because management of zone two
injuries is very controversial.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.330
Actually,
some people advocate

16:37.330 --> 16:39.199
surgical exploration
for everything.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.568
I'm pretty sure our surgeons
would not want to explore

16:41.568 --> 16:44.071
an asymptomatic patient
with a superficial wound.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.272
DeJESUS:
Could you
guys hurry up?

16:45.272 --> 16:46.773
My old lady's going
to burn my truck.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.408
Well, homes, maybe next time

16:48.408 --> 16:50.177
you won't double dip
with your moms-in-law.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.278
You see my wife's mother?

16:52.745 --> 16:55.215
Then don't criticize.
My bad.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.717
Now, I'm sure you guys are aware
of all the indications

16:57.717 --> 17:00.153
for immediate exploration,
right, Dr. Morris?

17:00.153 --> 17:02.089
Uh... airway compromise,
severe hemorrhage

17:02.089 --> 17:03.156
or expanding hematoma.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.790
But he has none of those.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.095
Good, so then let me go.
Right, but we can
always learn

17:08.095 --> 17:10.597
from every case.
Dr. Pratt...

17:10.597 --> 17:12.799
talk to me about selective
management with neck injuries.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.467
What?
Brother,
keep it short.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.137
Don't go Al Sharpton
on his ass.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.172
Duplex scan endoscopy
and gastrograffin swallow.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.273
Which you would only
do if he had symptoms.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.776
Well, slow your roll, bro,
because what proportion

17:23.776 --> 17:26.313
of zone two vascular
injuries are asymptomatic...

17:26.313 --> 17:28.615
Dr. Rasgotra?

17:28.615 --> 17:30.550
With a significant injury,

17:30.550 --> 17:32.652
he might have signs of
bleeding or hematoma.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.154
The guy is stable.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.323
Maybe. Maybe, but nine
out of a hundred times,

17:36.323 --> 17:38.225
asymptomatic patients
have lesions

17:38.225 --> 17:39.826
that require
surgical repair.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.261
How about that, Dr. Pratt?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.629
How about that?
Talk to me now.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.364
You know what?
How about I go

17:44.364 --> 17:46.766
check on my asthma patient
in Curtain Two?

17:46.766 --> 17:49.369
There's no
asthma patient
in Curtain Two.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.139
Yeah, well, uh, maybe
he went out for a smoke.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.308
I'll go find him.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.743
TAGGART:
Yes, Eve.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.745
I did. I put up
the sanitizers.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.213
( sighs )

18:00.213 --> 18:03.283
No, I didn't hand
out the pins.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.252
I am putting up the
poster as we speak.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.886
Yes.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.622
That special tape that
won't ruin the walls.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.525
Okay, bye-bye.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.394
Don't tell me-- Eve.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.364
It's her day off,
and she still calls in.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.499
Here. She wants everyone's
hands to be sanitized

18:19.499 --> 18:21.568
before they
touch a patient.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.735
"Scrub or Rub"?

18:22.735 --> 18:24.537
Yep.
Sounds kinky.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.739
We should be so lucky.
( chuckling )

18:26.739 --> 18:29.242
No, I was thinking we could get
something to eat.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.444
You know, maybe catch a movie
or something.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.313
Nah, I haven't seen
that one yet.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.483
All right, cool.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.451
I'll meet you out front.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.786
Hey...

18:39.786 --> 18:41.821
how you doing, Greg?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.224
What? You stalking me now?

18:44.224 --> 18:47.327
No, I'm here for...

18:47.327 --> 18:50.330
a sick friend.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.665
You sure you don't have
another illegitimate
kid up in there?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.467
We need to talk.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.735
What are you doing
after work?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.204
I've got a date.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.771
With Olivia Evans?
Nice girl.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.341
I've known her since
she was in high school.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.542
Oh, that's great.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.211
What about tomorrow?

19:04.211 --> 19:07.247
Maybe we could have dinner.
You like gumbo?

19:07.247 --> 19:08.948
I know a great place
over at King Drive.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.484
Then down the street,
there's a cat with
a pool hall, and...

19:11.484 --> 19:13.520
Listen, we're not eating
any gumbo together

19:13.520 --> 19:16.856
or playing pool,
all right?

19:16.856 --> 19:18.891
Then what would
you like to do?

19:18.891 --> 19:21.261
I would like for you
to leave me alone.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.895
For real.
We're done.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.365
Okay. You don't want to have
anything to do with me.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.833
What about your
little brother?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.235
Whoa, don't use him like that.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.669
He'd like to get
to know you, Greg.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.271
He just met me.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.273
I don't know what your mother
told you about me.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.442
But I have an idea
it wasn't everything.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.809
Come on, man.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.412
I could explain, but only
if you give me the time.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.414
I do not have the time.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.385
I'm trying here.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.523
Then stop.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.559
Fine.

19:52.559 --> 19:56.596
If you want to drop it
forever, that's your call.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.966
But you'll have
to live with it.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.534
Your choice.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.916
( sighs )

20:16.916 --> 20:20.553
BLAIRE:
I never got the whole marriage
talk from my mom.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.555
But you know what?
The moment that I told her

20:22.555 --> 20:25.024
that Jason proposed,
she pulled out this trunk.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.294
She had every detail
of my wedding planned.

20:27.294 --> 20:28.961
It was crazy.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.963
Oh, my God. Stop. Stop.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.032
KOVAC:
She wasn't going to
pressure you, huh?

20:33.032 --> 20:34.534
Yeah.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.406
She wanted it

20:39.406 --> 20:41.974
to be special.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.543
Which way is Lake Michigan?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.278
That way.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.447
You can see it from the
other side of the hospital.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.317
Can we go?
I shouldn't even have
you out of your room.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.384
Please?

20:51.384 --> 20:52.685
No.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.354
Come on.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.956
What does a girl have to do
to get a break with you?

20:59.892 --> 21:01.861
Hope this Clemente
doesn't become chief
of the department.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.430
I thought you liked him.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.398
I did, until I
had to present to him.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.334
"Sure, the patient
doesn't have flesh-eating
bacteria right now,

21:07.334 --> 21:09.336
but if he did, what
signs or symptoms
might he have?"

21:09.336 --> 21:11.604
"Is that muscle spasm
in the jaw any chance it
could be acute tetanus?"

21:11.604 --> 21:12.939
You know,
I'm all for teaching,

21:12.939 --> 21:14.341
but this guy doesn't
know when to stop.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.508
Yeah, he's annoying.
You just said

21:15.508 --> 21:17.577
you liked his bloody
shoes, you wanker.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.046
Just because he's
annoying doesn't mean I
can't like his shoes.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.382
You going to
Ray's gig tonight?

21:22.382 --> 21:24.684
Oh, the hell with Ray.
He's probably upstairs
having a blast.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.687
Jerry, it's Ray.
Save me. I'm bored stiff.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.756
Try picturing every
woman up there naked.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.391
That always works for me.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.426
Come on! Are there any drug
cases down there?

21:33.426 --> 21:35.362
Couple of traumas rolling in.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.096
BARDELLI:
Lola Simon, seven-year-old
with crush injury.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.498
B.P. 70 palp.
RAGOSTRA:
What crushed her?

21:38.498 --> 21:39.732
Your next patient.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.668
PRATT:
Lola, move your legs for me.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.603
Seven-year-old girl.
No sign of drugs.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.037
MAN:
Yeah, I'm king of the world!

21:45.037 --> 21:47.374
Whoo-hoo!

21:47.374 --> 21:48.841
King of the world.
Looks like you forgot
how to fly, King.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.710
Tommy Bonetti, stood up
on the tilt-a-whirl

21:50.710 --> 21:52.011
at the Saint
Ignatius Fair.
( cackling )

21:52.011 --> 21:53.480
Is he on drugs?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.014
Aw, he might have
just hit his head.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.916
Sounds like drugs.
I'm on my way down.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.651
Move away from the light!

21:58.651 --> 22:00.487
Okay, we're trying
to take care of you, man!

22:00.487 --> 22:02.855
You-You look like an alien!
Don't probe me!

22:02.855 --> 22:04.524
Please sedate him!

22:04.524 --> 22:06.659
I have to assess
his neuro status first.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.960
( grunting )

22:07.960 --> 22:09.662
Taking the hemocue.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.464
( garbled yell )

22:11.464 --> 22:12.665
PRATT:
Process the spinal films

22:12.665 --> 22:15.101
before you
take the rest.
Here you go.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.969
Hey, I'm rolling out, man.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.405
What, you scared
of a little blood?

22:18.405 --> 22:20.106
Hey, squeeze my hand.
Systolic's 65.

22:20.106 --> 22:24.544
All right, no fluid in the
abdomen, pericardium is clear.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.112
Looks like spinal shock

22:26.112 --> 22:27.547
with a high
thoracic injury.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.881
Am I right?

22:28.881 --> 22:31.618
I'm way out of
my league, man.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.487
Don't you remember Bartlett's
lecture on blunt trauma?

22:34.487 --> 22:36.456
All right, sweetie, listen up.
I'm gonna poke you, okay?

22:36.456 --> 22:37.790
Tell me when you feel this.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.125
ROGOSTRA:
Okay, start dopamine
at five mikes.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.827
900 of methylprednisolone.

22:40.827 --> 22:41.994
Ow!

22:41.994 --> 22:43.896
Sensory level at T-four.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.433
How you doing, Lola?

22:49.469 --> 22:50.903
That's a big bug.
Man, you just killed
our mascot.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.439
( retches )
Oh, here she goes.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.441
Log roll.
Keep her on the backboard.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.575
PRATT:
Come on.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.143
Suction.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.111
Look, uh, you know,
some of the older

22:59.111 --> 23:01.180
U of I crews are hooking
up at Cherry Red tonight.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.482
You got plans?

23:02.482 --> 23:03.483
( Bonetti groaning )

23:03.483 --> 23:04.584
Pratt, we need you in here.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.185
Yeah, I'll try
to roll through.

23:06.185 --> 23:09.121
Pratt, now!
Go see what's up.
I'll intubate.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.892
( yelling continues )
Dude, I swear,

23:12.892 --> 23:14.594
if you don't stay still,
I'm going to put

23:14.594 --> 23:16.028
this needle
through your heart.
Morris...

23:16.028 --> 23:17.196
( cackling )

23:17.196 --> 23:18.698
Shouldn't we sedate
and paralyze?

23:18.698 --> 23:20.500
I would if I had a line.
He took his I.V. out.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.469
Since when did Alfred E.
Newman become a doctor?
Ha-ha-ha!

23:22.469 --> 23:23.703
What about
I.M. versed?

23:23.703 --> 23:25.004
Gave five.
It's not touching him.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.639
Okay, what did he take?

23:26.639 --> 23:28.641
Maybe ice, coke.
Tachy at 140.
Pupils are dilated.

23:28.641 --> 23:29.809
Dude, what the hell are you on?

23:29.809 --> 23:30.777
Her in a minute.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.878
I can't find the vein.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.112
Her in a minute.
How about Haldol?

23:33.112 --> 23:34.481
No, he could seize.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.015
Morris, let me try the line.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.817
( Bonetti grunting )
HALEH:
Dr. Pratt!

23:37.817 --> 23:39.886
Go ahead and push the sux.
This guy's
unstable as hell,

23:39.886 --> 23:41.554
and we can't get a line.
I'm tied up.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.722
We need help.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.990
You got to get Clemente.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.024
( groaning )

23:45.024 --> 23:46.058
Is there another
attending on?

23:46.058 --> 23:47.560
Clemente's the only one.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.096
We're never gonna handle
this ourselves.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.498
I'm gonna do a femoral cutdown.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.164
Are you serious?

23:52.164 --> 23:53.666
He needs access.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.067
Pulse keeps going up.
( laughing )

23:55.067 --> 23:56.769
Mix up esmolol.
We need to slow down his rate.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.171
Ten blade.
Hey, we got
sugar in here?

23:59.171 --> 24:01.874
Oh, wow, we got a trauma.
I didn't know.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.810
Pager's probably
not working.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.177
No, my pager's working.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.714
20-foot fall complicated
by unknown intoxication.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.081
What? What are
you guys doing?

24:09.081 --> 24:10.683
A femoral cutdown.

24:10.683 --> 24:11.884
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:11.884 --> 24:12.952
Everybody take a deep breath.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.186
Take a deep breath.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.221
( Bonetti cackling )

24:15.221 --> 24:17.089
Get my briefcase under admit.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.125
Banana cheese!
CLEMENTE:
Yeah, banana cheese.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.060
What'd he take?
BARNETT:
Won't say.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.163
Tachy with mydriasis.
My guess is a sympathomimetic.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.197
( grunting )

24:25.197 --> 24:26.733
Bad, bad guess.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.034
Skin and membranes are dry.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.602
It's an anticholinergic.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.103
Electrolytes are back yet?

24:31.103 --> 24:32.572
Uh, right here.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.074
( Bonetti grunting )

24:35.074 --> 24:37.677
Hyperchloremia,
anion gap is minus four.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.145
How could that be?

24:41.614 --> 24:43.583
Skittles, people.
Skittles.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.618
Very popular
with the kids these days.

24:45.618 --> 24:48.888
It's cold pills
with dextromethorphan
hydrogen bromide.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.123
The lab analyzer thinks
bromide is chloride,

24:51.123 --> 24:52.559
you get a reversal
of the gap.

24:52.559 --> 24:53.660
( yelling )

24:53.660 --> 24:54.727
Anything to calm him down?

24:54.727 --> 24:56.028
Two migs of I.M. physostigmine.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.229
He still needs access.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.197
Here you go.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.899
I'm Rick James, bitch!

24:59.899 --> 25:01.033
Close your eyes.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.802
Go to your happy place, son.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.871
Now, what time did
the chem panel come back?

25:04.871 --> 25:06.839
He's got weird anatomy.
We couldn't find
the subclavian.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.649
There it is, right there.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.918
See, the probe allows
us to cannulate the vein

25:18.918 --> 25:20.853
under direct
visualization.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.892
That's... very cool.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.827
You carry that around with you
all the time?

25:27.827 --> 25:28.861
It's just a demo.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.797
I ran the phase three trials.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.266
Beautiful, beautiful.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.868
It's like shooting
fish in a barrel.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.705
Heart rate's down to 80.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.040
I guess we didn't need
the beta-blockers, did we?

25:43.710 --> 25:45.111
I trust you guys

25:45.111 --> 25:46.613
can finish without me?

25:46.613 --> 25:48.247
MORRIS:
No problem, boss.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.622
Hey, even if you think
I'm a pain in the ass,

25:55.622 --> 25:57.657
it should never get in the way
of the patient care.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.258
You with me?

26:00.960 --> 26:03.630
Good.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.167
Dr. Lockhart.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.837
Hey.

26:10.837 --> 26:12.004
What's up?

26:12.004 --> 26:13.172
Well, everything.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.941
And almost
twice a day.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.209
Congratulations.
Hear you're getting out
of here today.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.244
You thought it
stunk to work here.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.012
Try being a patient.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.914
By the way,
thanks for the date.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.084
She told you.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.318
Someone had to pay her.

26:26.318 --> 26:27.353
Well, it was supposed
to be a freebee.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.088
It was the
first time.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.057
Look, initially, it kind
of turned me off

26:31.057 --> 26:32.659
when I learned that
she was a professional.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.893
Then when I thought
about it,

26:33.893 --> 26:35.928
it, uh,
it turned me on.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.697
We're both
professionals.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.766
So you didn't need me,
after all.

26:39.766 --> 26:43.235
Well, I guess not.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.972
Hey, I don't remember
your name.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.007
Abby. And, uh, you're
a little late, Lou.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.676
I came to see
how Stephanie
was doing.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.177
She had her breasts removed.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.812
Why don't you pick up
a pink ribbon on
your way out?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.080
What? She did?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.682
Yeah, she did.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.416
What are you
talking about?

26:57.416 --> 26:59.852
Stephanie says
you disappeared on her.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.320
She told the nurse
not to let me in.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.255
And every time I called,

27:03.255 --> 27:06.258
she wouldn't say
why she was here
and kept going on

27:06.258 --> 27:10.930
about how she
couldn't handle dating
anyone right now.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.198
Why would she
do that?

27:12.198 --> 27:14.200
I don't know.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.435
All I know is I can't
stop thinking about her

27:16.435 --> 27:18.270
and I'm a little worried.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.373
Come on. Come on.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.875
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.044
Oh, Dr. Clemente.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.046
Aw, damn it!
Do you have
a moment?

27:27.046 --> 27:30.116
You know, you should really
consider getting one of these.

27:30.116 --> 27:33.185
It might keep you
from hacking up
the patients.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.087
I'm sorry I didn't call
you in earlier.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.989
Bonetti's gone up
to the ICU.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.458
We got to really
consider preemptive orders.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.960
That was really
unprofessional of me.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.194
Nurses transporting
patients;

27:42.194 --> 27:43.362
what a waste
of resources.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.931
Dr. Clemente,
are you listening to me?

27:44.931 --> 27:46.265
Actually, no.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.301
I lost.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.738
Okay, look,
a femoral cutdown has

27:51.738 --> 27:54.440
to be a last-ditch effort
in a peri-arrest patient.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.975
Okay, and Skittles boy
wasn't quite there yet.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.176
Well, I thought he was.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.979
Oh, you thought he was.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.949
Look, look, I know, I know.
I was a resident, too,

28:02.949 --> 28:04.884
and I thought I had
the keys to the kingdom,

28:04.884 --> 28:07.019
but the great thing is
that we can always learn.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.254
That's why I'm here.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.089
Sometimes you want
to do it yourself.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.958
Sometimes your ego does,

28:11.958 --> 28:15.361
but the patient would rather
that I do it, believe me.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.029
You're right.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.765
No, it's not about
being right.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.867
It's... Okay, look.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.302
I consider you, Pratt,
Morris, every resident

28:23.302 --> 28:24.503
and every student here
an investment in the future.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.405
My dividend comes

28:26.405 --> 28:28.107
when something that
I've taught you
saves a life.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.876
That's it.

28:29.876 --> 28:32.411
And you should really consider
surgery as an elective.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.146
Well, why do you say that?

28:34.146 --> 28:35.882
Because you're quick to cut

28:35.882 --> 28:38.785
and you like to use a scalpel
more than your brain.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.790
STEPHANIE:
Come in.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.026
Hi.
Hey.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.095
I brought you
some company.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.401
Hello.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.904
I heard what
happened.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.173
Hi.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.975
Come in. Sit down.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.821
Chocolate.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.533
Hi.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.902
I'd like to schedule
an outpatient mammogram.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.538
Sure. Patient's name?

29:32.538 --> 29:34.941
Abby Lockhart.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.378
First, you miss
morning rounds,

29:39.378 --> 29:42.281
and now they tell me
you're avoiding
Poison Control.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.516
No, I got stuck
with a consult.

29:44.516 --> 29:48.888
Look, a bunch of Zen monks
made tea from this plant
in their garden.

29:48.888 --> 29:49.989
Now they have vomiting,
diarrhea.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.257
Some are tachycardic,

29:51.257 --> 29:52.458
some bradycardic,
some hypotensive,

29:52.458 --> 29:53.492
some hypertensive.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.327
Not a clear-cut toxidrome.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.063
I haven't been able
to identify this plant
on the Internet.

29:57.063 --> 30:00.199
I even sent digital photos
to the botany department, but...

30:00.199 --> 30:02.034
It's not jimson weed,

30:02.034 --> 30:05.437
not foxglove,
not oleander.

30:07.339 --> 30:12.511
Well, maybe, uh,
it's tabaco gigante.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.613
You know something?
You may be right.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.415
I saw this once
in Mexico.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.284
It's a tobacco plant.

30:18.284 --> 30:21.353
Your patients have
nicotine toxicity.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.022
Good call.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.126
( mouthing )

30:29.929 --> 30:31.530
Dr. Clemente,

30:31.530 --> 30:34.333
why are my research
assistants sitting
in the waiting area?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.502
I don't know.
Parking garage
was too cold?

30:36.502 --> 30:37.569
They're collecting
data for me.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.338
Okay, all right.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.173
The looky-loos were getting
in the way of the work.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.608
Then you just tell
them to step back.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.210
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want to overstep.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.577
I thought maybe
it should just come from you.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.014
Overstep? You pulled
the plug on my study.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.582
Look, I meant that more
as a time-out kind of thing.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.219
You told them
that my study
was useless.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.621
Look, I know
what happened in Newark,

30:55.621 --> 30:57.957
and I really do not want
a repeat here, okay?

31:02.294 --> 31:05.097
All right, look,
bottom line:

31:05.097 --> 31:06.933
You hired me to make
this place more efficient,

31:06.933 --> 31:08.234
and that's what
I'm trying to do.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.937
And if and when
we start bedside registration,

31:10.937 --> 31:12.371
it's going to make
your study, I don't know,

31:12.371 --> 31:14.306
not so relevant?

31:14.306 --> 31:16.508
Yeah, I've got a $100,000
grant that says that it won't.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.610
You got $100,000?
Why don't we just go digital?

31:18.610 --> 31:21.080
Listen, I run
this hospital!

31:21.080 --> 31:24.083
We start bedside registration,
that goes through me.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.417
If you put my students

31:25.417 --> 31:27.019
on a time-out, that
goes through me.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.955
If you want to wash
the floors differently,

31:28.955 --> 31:30.556
that goes through me.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.624
Do I make myself clear?

31:32.624 --> 31:34.360
Yeah, I got
one more question for you.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.462
Does my answer
go through you?

31:42.334 --> 31:46.238
My mom loved
seeing the lake.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.240
Look at the water.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.578
At least some things
stay the same.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.416
We should
really get back.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.586
You always been
such a worrier?

32:00.586 --> 32:03.990
I've always had things
to worry about.

32:13.565 --> 32:16.002
Do you think this was God?

32:16.002 --> 32:18.004
What?

32:18.004 --> 32:19.705
Me waking up.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.242
I don't know.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.411
You think it was science,
don't you?

32:28.314 --> 32:32.018
I've seen deeply religious
people come to the hospital.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.220
Prayer did nothing for them.

32:34.220 --> 32:39.058
And then I've seen plenty
of skeptics

32:39.058 --> 32:43.029
experience miraculous
recoveries.

32:43.029 --> 32:46.165
So you think it was fate?

32:49.235 --> 32:51.537
I think...

32:51.537 --> 32:56.075
I'm glad we're both here,
able to wonder about it.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.147
Yeah.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.187
Man, how you gonna
punk me like that?

33:08.187 --> 33:10.289
Hey, what's up, little man?
You know where Olivia is?

33:10.289 --> 33:11.357
Yeah, she's down the hall.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.524
Thanks.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.360
( sighs )

33:14.360 --> 33:17.396
CHARLIE:
I hear you fellas.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.765
But you sound like a
bunch of knuckleheads.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.467
BOY:
Hey, all I'm saying is,

33:21.467 --> 33:23.669
you can't feel nothin'
with no jimmy on.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.605
Get used to 'em.
There's no alternative.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.307
Getting a girl pregnant

33:28.307 --> 33:31.410
is 18 years of lock-down.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.079
Half your check
going to Uncle Sam,

33:33.079 --> 33:34.713
the other half going
to your kids and...

33:34.713 --> 33:36.382
The baby mama.

33:36.382 --> 33:39.118
And what happen if you miss
a child-support payment?

33:39.118 --> 33:41.587
Who's going to be
blowing up your pager?

33:41.587 --> 33:43.189
My baby mama.

33:43.189 --> 33:46.392
Having a kid at your age

33:46.392 --> 33:49.695
ain't what you want to do.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.098
Trust me.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.604
BLAIRE:
Do you miss Croatia?

33:58.604 --> 34:00.306
I have family there...

34:00.306 --> 34:01.707
but there are more
opportunites

34:01.707 --> 34:04.176
for me here.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.345
I like Chicago.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.847
Except the winter sucks.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.717
Yeah. You can always go
inside and warm up.

34:16.755 --> 34:22.793
You know how I keep asking you
about the, um... accident?

34:28.134 --> 34:31.870
It's because I keep having these
flashes that don't add up.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.405
What kind of flashes?

34:33.405 --> 34:35.440
I remember being scared.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.844
We'd had just gotten coffee

34:39.844 --> 34:42.714
and I remember seeing
my mom's face...

34:46.284 --> 34:49.288
Her eyes were petrified.

34:51.357 --> 34:55.661
And I hear her screams, but her
screams are muffled by the radio

34:55.661 --> 34:58.664
and there's blood
and laughter...

34:58.664 --> 35:02.734
there's... lots of laughter.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.836
And at first I thought
it was just a dream,

35:04.836 --> 35:11.243
but the images are so vivid...
they're so clear...

35:11.243 --> 35:12.678
Come and sit down.

35:12.678 --> 35:13.645
( crying )

35:13.645 --> 35:14.813
Sit down.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.486
Something else happened
that night

35:20.486 --> 35:23.189
and not knowing what it is,
is killing me.

35:27.193 --> 35:30.829
( sobbing )

35:30.829 --> 35:35.767
But I... need the t-truth.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.436
Blaire.
I want to be...

35:37.436 --> 35:40.339
out...

35:40.339 --> 35:41.807
figure it...

35:41.807 --> 35:43.942
Blaire!

35:43.942 --> 35:46.512
Come on, Blaire, stay with me.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.846
Hey, I need a monitored bed.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.248
Trauma One.
What's going on?

35:49.248 --> 35:50.682
Page Shulansky in Neurology!

35:50.682 --> 35:52.918
Hey, I'm Dr. Clemente.

35:52.918 --> 35:53.852
So, what's the problem?

35:53.852 --> 35:55.254
She's not talking.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.488
All right, get me
an accu-check,

35:56.488 --> 35:57.623
a hemocue and
a pulse ox.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.291
She doesn't need that.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.726
And can we have her friend
wait outside, please?

36:00.726 --> 36:01.793
I'm not her friend!

36:01.793 --> 36:03.229
Uh, this is Dr. Kovac.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.496
He's one of
our attendings.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.432
CLEMENTE:
Hey, Doc, sorry.
I had no clue.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.667
Ma'am?

36:08.667 --> 36:09.668
Can you hear me?

36:09.668 --> 36:10.602
Her name's Blaire.

36:10.602 --> 36:11.770
Can you hear me?

36:11.770 --> 36:12.838
MAlIK:
Shulansky's at the V.A.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.640
Damn it.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.741
Gaze is fixed to the right.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.243
Need a CBC,

36:17.243 --> 36:18.777
chem panel, and a head CT.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.879
No. She need fluoxitine, sinemet
and dextro-amphetamine.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.249
Excuse me, Doc, but I
don't know what the hell

36:23.249 --> 36:25.384
you're talking about.
Abby, run to the pharmacy
and get the meds.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.985
There is a
standardized approach

36:26.985 --> 36:28.587
to dealing with a patient
with altered mental status.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.422
This not a standard patient.

36:30.422 --> 36:31.890
She's been on
an experimental cocktail.
Hey...

36:31.890 --> 36:34.426
Abby, Fluoxitine, sinement
and dextroamphetamine.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.628
Abby, please go!

36:42.968 --> 36:44.536
Hey!

36:44.536 --> 36:46.572
Hey, need some help!

36:46.572 --> 36:48.807
Hey!

36:48.807 --> 36:50.876
What's up?

36:50.876 --> 36:54.346
Fluoxitine, sinement,
dextro-amphetamine.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.814
Write it up.
( groans )

36:55.814 --> 36:57.316
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

36:57.316 --> 36:59.285
Are you crazy?
You can't go back here!

36:59.285 --> 37:01.420
CLEMENTE:
Crit's fine.
Sodium, potassium are normal.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.454
Told you that.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.855
CT is ready.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.324
CLEMENTE:
Okay, let's move her now.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.492
She needs the meds.

37:06.492 --> 37:07.993
Dr. Weaver, we
could be missing

37:07.993 --> 37:09.895
a brain bleed,
a mass effect.
I know.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.697
So we don't have
time to screw around.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.499
The meds woke her up
from a coma.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.401
If they did, we'd have
coma patients waking up

37:15.401 --> 37:17.436
all over the country.
All I know is they
worked for her.

37:17.436 --> 37:18.904
Got 'em.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.339
CLEMENTE:
You're not gonna
actually let him

37:20.339 --> 37:21.607
go through
this, are you?

37:21.607 --> 37:23.775
Are you confident these meds
are gonna work?

37:27.813 --> 37:30.482
Because, if not, there's going
to be a tall guy in a cheap suit

37:30.482 --> 37:32.451
from the state asking questions.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.555
It's worth a try, Kerry.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.728
All right,
hold this scanner.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.630
I'll give him five minutes.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.500
You know what?
Don't sweat it.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.868
Dr. Kovac, you're
the physician

37:49.868 --> 37:51.537
of record now,
cause I'm not gonna be

37:51.537 --> 37:53.038
on the chart
when the family sues.

37:53.038 --> 37:57.008
Well, I'm in luck--
there is no family.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.378
And fluoxitine in at 20:19.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.012
Let's get up to CT.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.981
As soon as I get
a portable monitor.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.551
Blaire.

38:05.551 --> 38:06.952
Blaire.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.754
Eyes opening to pain.

38:10.422 --> 38:11.490
( groaning softly )

38:11.490 --> 38:12.891
Incomprehensible
verbal activity.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.793
I got a GCS of 2-2-4.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.628
Check her gag.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.529
WEAVER:
Whoa!

38:17.529 --> 38:19.365
Two of Ativan, now.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.366
100% oxygen,

38:20.366 --> 38:21.733
non-rebreather.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.802
Does she have a
history of seizures?
No!

38:23.802 --> 38:26.672
Well, any of the meds you pushed
could have caused this.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.607
So could falling
drug levels.

38:28.607 --> 38:31.777
So could withdrawal.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.412
( grunts )
Another round of Ativan.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.481
( grunting )

38:35.481 --> 38:38.083
ZOE ( laughing ):
I really liked that last one.
Is it new?

38:38.083 --> 38:40.419
Yeah, it's call "Blood Wine."

38:40.419 --> 38:41.520
Oh, Blood Wine.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.821
How'd you think of that?

38:42.821 --> 38:45.557
I cut my finger
opening a bottle of merlot.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.459
( chuckles )

38:47.459 --> 38:49.761
So, um, you and your friend
headed home?

38:49.761 --> 38:52.130
Uh... I don't know
what she's doing.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.799
Do you know
what you're doing?

38:53.799 --> 38:56.067
Yeah, I know what
I'd like to do.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.969
Hold that thought.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.572
I'm gonna to settle up with the
boys, and I'll be right back.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.441
Hey, you guys are late.
We were the opening act.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.443
Clemente had us pull
current journal articles

39:04.443 --> 39:06.011
to justify the treatment
of every patient.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.013
You want to
get something to eat?

39:09.815 --> 39:11.450
I have plans.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.419
Your plans
have friends?

39:14.653 --> 39:17.088
Let's see.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.624
Zoe.
Yes?

39:18.624 --> 39:20.025
That's my boy, Archie.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.428
What up, ladies?
You guys hungry?

39:22.428 --> 39:24.129
We want to
meet the band.

39:24.996 --> 39:28.734
I play drums.

39:28.734 --> 39:29.935
Yeah, no, I'm serious.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.803
Like...
( mimics drum playing )

39:31.803 --> 39:32.971
It's my marching band.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.740
We won the nationals.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.842
( mimics drum playing )

39:36.842 --> 39:38.109
Turning and the--

39:38.109 --> 39:39.578
boom, boom, and then the boom.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.447
And then we did like a...

39:41.447 --> 39:43.915
Guys?

39:43.915 --> 39:45.016
Ray!

39:45.951 --> 39:48.654
KOVAC:
Blaire?

39:48.654 --> 39:51.022
Blaire, open your eyes.

39:51.022 --> 39:54.760
Maybe she's post-ictal.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.962
Or the Ativan didn't wear off.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.000
I shouldn't have
pushed the meds.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.604
You don't know why
she had a seizure.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.839
Maybe we overloaded
her synapses.

40:10.842 --> 40:14.546
Luka, there is no way to know
why she fell back into this.

40:17.483 --> 40:20.886
Yeah.

40:24.790 --> 40:25.991
I have to go.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.026
Are you okay?

40:32.998 --> 40:34.733
The state conservator agreed

40:34.733 --> 40:37.135
to admit Blaire
to the hospital for two days

40:37.135 --> 40:38.904
to see if there's
any improvement.

40:38.904 --> 40:42.974
If not, she'll go back
to the nursing home.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.085
I could have been a doctor,
but why poetry?
( vocalizing )

40:54.085 --> 40:55.654
Why I?

40:55.654 --> 40:57.689
Why me? Why I?
I could have been a lawyer,

40:57.689 --> 40:59.991
but why poetry? Poetry.

40:59.991 --> 41:03.662
Why... poetry?

41:03.662 --> 41:04.963
Thank you.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.236
Where's the waitress?

41:11.236 --> 41:12.971
You know, to hell with her.
What do you want?

41:12.971 --> 41:14.873
Uh... light beer.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.808
Don't tell me the lipo doctor's
scared of getting handles.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.844
Don't hate...
I look good.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.045
( both chuckle )

41:20.045 --> 41:21.847
I'll be back.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.584
Hey, what's up, bro?

41:25.584 --> 41:27.653
Can I get two beers, one light?

41:27.653 --> 41:28.687
What, you want something?

41:28.687 --> 41:29.988
A conversation would be cool.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.723
You haven't said anything
to me all night.

41:31.723 --> 41:32.824
Can barely hear
in this place.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.626
You could hear everyone
just fine.

41:34.626 --> 41:37.228
What did I do, Greg?
Just tell me what I did.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.764
You should have told
me he was in there.

41:38.764 --> 41:39.765
You want me
to survey the building

41:39.765 --> 41:41.633
every time you come?
Yes!

41:41.633 --> 41:43.635
Look, he's the one down there
helping those kids.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.170
Who sews up
those kids once

41:45.170 --> 41:46.938
they leave
your place?
Well, your father tries

41:46.938 --> 41:48.840
to help them
before they get to you.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.009
Listen, Charlie Pratt
may be a lot of things,

41:51.009 --> 41:53.579
but he's not my father,
my dad, or my pops.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.581
He's just some guy who
got my mom pregnant.

41:55.581 --> 41:57.583
So, basically, he
made the same mistake

41:57.583 --> 41:58.684
he's warning
those kids about.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.118
Greg, wait...

42:03.254 --> 42:05.023
You want to hate him,
I can't stop you,

42:05.023 --> 42:06.825
but Charlie's a good guy.

42:06.825 --> 42:09.595
20 hours a week with the kids,
runs a basketball league,

42:09.595 --> 42:10.896
rehab houses
or poor people!

42:10.896 --> 42:12.698
Yeah, see,
that's the problem.

42:12.698 --> 42:14.933
I've waited my whole life
to spit in my old man's face.

42:14.933 --> 42:17.235
And not only is he not laying
face down in the gutter...

42:17.235 --> 42:19.938
People change...
...but he's building houses
for people for free!

42:22.841 --> 42:26.211
No. No.
Greg.

42:26.211 --> 42:30.148
( rail car passing )

42:44.830 --> 42:47.633
( sighs )

42:52.704 --> 42:55.206
( device whirring )

43:05.884 --> 43:10.121
KOVAC:
Blaire, I hope
you can hear me.

43:10.121 --> 43:14.926
On that night you and
your mom were driving,

43:14.926 --> 43:16.995
you stopped at
the red light.

43:16.995 --> 43:20.766
Another car pulled
up next to you.

43:23.168 --> 43:25.270
There were three men inside.

43:25.270 --> 43:31.309
They, uh... pulled a gun.

43:31.309 --> 43:34.946
They dragged your mom
outside of the car.
