- Damn.
What you got

00:15.833 --> 00:17.200
going on today, girl?

00:17.267 --> 00:19.067
- Oh, nothing.
I'm just, uh...you know,

00:19.133 --> 00:21.133
working in the studio.
- Well, I'd like to stay

00:21.200 --> 00:23.033
and get to know you better,
but I got to get to work.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.333
- Get out of here, perv.
That's for Montana.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.933
- Oh.
- She's just here

00:27.000 --> 00:28.667
going through
some of my old paintings

00:28.733 --> 00:31.700
to see if anything's worth
including in my next show.

00:31.767 --> 00:33.867
You know,
not every boss

00:33.933 --> 00:36.867
wants to sleep
with their assistant.

00:36.933 --> 00:39.700
Besides, she's straight.
I tried.

00:39.767 --> 00:41.300
- Sure you're not still trying?

00:42.733 --> 00:44.800
- Montana,
this is my roommate Liza.

00:44.867 --> 00:46.933
- Oh, hi.
So nice to meet you.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.333
- It's nice to meet you
too, Montana.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.367
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:52.433 --> 00:53.767
- Why don't you sit down,
take a break.

00:53.833 --> 00:56.200
I made us some delicious
avocado toast.

00:56.267 --> 00:57.700
- Oh, thank you,

00:57.767 --> 00:58.867
but I'm actually gluten free.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.100
- Oh.

01:00.167 --> 01:01.967

Of course you are.

01:12.067 --> 01:14.300
- Marketing research I did
on influencers.

01:14.367 --> 01:17.533
- I'm not sure that's going
to come up today, but thank you.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.133
- Morning, everyone.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.533
I'd like to jump right in,
if we could.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.667
- Oh, I have some news.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.200
But it can wait.

01:23.267 --> 01:25.267
- Invitations went out
for Bonfire,

01:25.333 --> 01:26.533
the top-secret
Achilles retreat

01:26.600 --> 01:28.200
for leaders in publishing.

01:28.267 --> 01:31.767
Regrettably, Empirical
did not get invited.

01:33.367 --> 01:34.933
But...

01:35.067 --> 01:36.167
Millennial did.

01:36.233 --> 01:37.767
- Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

01:37.833 --> 01:39.067
- What?
- See for yourself.

01:39.067 --> 01:40.500
- Oh, my God.
[gasps]

01:40.567 --> 01:42.333
This is huge.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.300
- Rod Stewart sat next to me
at Sushi Nakazawa last night.

01:44.367 --> 01:45.933
- What does it mean?

01:46.067 --> 01:47.400
- I assume it means
he lives in the Village.

01:47.467 --> 01:48.667
- No, I mean,
is this something

01:48.733 --> 01:49.800
that we need
to prepare for?

01:49.867 --> 01:51.333
- You have been asked to be

01:51.400 --> 01:53.433
on the
"Future of Publishing" panel,

01:53.500 --> 01:55.267
so prepare some thoughts
for that.

01:55.333 --> 01:58.067
Otherwise, have a good time.

01:58.133 --> 02:01.567
- [squealing softly]

02:01.633 --> 02:03.733
- Moving on.
Congratulations.

- * Shoop, yeah, shoop *

02:06.633 --> 02:08.533
- Kelsey, Diana.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.733
Can I see you both
in my office?

02:10.800 --> 02:12.667
- Is something wrong?
- It's about Liza.

02:17.333 --> 02:18.600
What do you two think

02:18.667 --> 02:20.067
about giving Liza
a promotion?

02:21.533 --> 02:23.467
- What would that
look like for me?

02:23.533 --> 02:25.400
- [inhales]
I don't plan on

02:25.467 --> 02:28.067
leaving you without
an assistant, but...

02:28.100 --> 02:30.567
I think she could handle

02:30.633 --> 02:32.733
more responsibility
with Millennial.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.567
- Actually, I think that

02:34.633 --> 02:37.200
Millennial could use someone
a step above Liza.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.500
We are... [chuckles]
Growing really fast.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.667
- Well, in my opinion,

02:43.733 --> 02:46.667
Liza is up to the task...

02:46.733 --> 02:49.667
but I'm open to exploring
other options.

02:49.733 --> 02:55.333
* *

02:55.400 --> 02:56.733
- Make a reservation.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.200
We need to have lunch.

02:58.267 --> 03:01.067

03:02.300 --> 03:03.767
- Thank you.
- That's enough for her.

03:06.267 --> 03:07.933
- This is nice.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.300
What's the occasion?

03:09.367 --> 03:10.400
- Liza,
we have a heavy afternoon,

03:10.467 --> 03:11.867
so I'll cut to the chase.

03:11.933 --> 03:13.533
I know that Kelsey
stole your boyfriend.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.900
- She absolutely did not.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.767
- But she's living with him.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.533
- Yes, they are roommates.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.200
But Kelsey hasn't done
anything wrong.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.233
- Then...you must have.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.267
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
Just fix it.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.900
Kelsey is in a position now
to make decisions,

03:28.967 --> 03:30.900
and I would hate
to see you let personal drama

03:30.967 --> 03:34.333
get in the way of...
a promising career.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.067
- Of course.
You're right.

03:37.133 --> 03:41.200
- If you care to talk about it,
I'm a pretty good listener.

03:41.267 --> 03:45.133
- Well, the truth is...

03:45.200 --> 03:46.800
the reason Josh and I ended

03:46.867 --> 03:48.333
had absolutely nothing
to do with Kelsey--

03:48.400 --> 03:49.567
- Shh! Richard's ex-wife
just walked in.

03:49.633 --> 03:51.067
- What?
- Don't, don't--

03:51.067 --> 03:53.533
- How do you know?

03:53.600 --> 03:56.100
- Because I Facebook stalk her.
Is that what you want to hear?

03:56.167 --> 03:57.433
Her name is Winnie.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.067
She also happens
to be a therapist.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.267
Her best friend Cindy
lives in Nyack.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.267
- Uh...
well, we can leave if you--

04:04.333 --> 04:06.500
- Don't be ridiculous.
We are not in high school.

04:06.567 --> 04:08.200
Hi.

04:08.267 --> 04:10.300
- Thank you.

04:10.367 --> 04:11.400
- Should I introduce myself
to her?

04:11.467 --> 04:12.933
- No, I don't think so.

04:13.067 --> 04:14.433
- I feel like I know her.
- You don't.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.933
Diana.
- I'm fine.

04:21.767 --> 04:23.333
Hello, Winnie?

04:23.400 --> 04:25.867
I'm Diana Trout.
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

04:25.933 --> 04:28.167
- No, no,
but we have a...

04:28.233 --> 04:31.467
mutual acquaintance.
Richard Caldwell?

04:31.533 --> 04:34.700
- How do you know Richard?

04:34.767 --> 04:36.300
- We're dating.

04:36.367 --> 04:37.767
- You're Richard's
new girlfriend?

04:41.267 --> 04:44.300

04:47.200 --> 04:50.067
I'm sorry--
I'm sorry, you seem very nice.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.867

04:52.933 --> 04:55.133
- Hi.
We'll take these to go.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.067
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.200
- I found a bunch of stats

05:03.267 --> 05:04.767
on publishing trends.

05:04.833 --> 05:05.900
"Wall Street Journal"
did an article.

05:05.967 --> 05:07.667
So did "Publisher's Weekly."

05:07.733 --> 05:09.333
I thought those might be useful
for the panel.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.433
- Yeah, what I really need
is for you

05:11.500 --> 05:14.667
to book a rental car
from the Burlington airport.

05:14.733 --> 05:16.867
I'll send you a PDF
of my driver's license--

05:16.933 --> 05:18.600
I'm assuming you don't want
to be in the system.

05:18.667 --> 05:20.400
- No, it's okay.
I figured out

05:20.467 --> 05:23.533
all the ID tricks
a while ago.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.933
- Of course you did.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.433
- Mm-hmm.
Sounds like an excuse

05:49.500 --> 05:51.867
to hook up.
- Oh, yeah, that too.

05:51.933 --> 05:53.767
- I need to go on
a little retreat.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.867

I'm telling ya...

05:55.933 --> 05:59.267

Hello, beautiful strangers.

- What?

06:01.367 --> 06:03.533
Do you have
a better suggestion here?

06:03.600 --> 06:04.633
- No.
- All right.

I found some camping gear

06:30.067 --> 06:31.767
that some old girlfriends
left behind.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.400
I thought you could use it
for your adventure in the woods.

06:33.467 --> 06:35.067
- Uh, thanks,
but I think this is going

06:35.067 --> 06:36.667
to be more like "glamping"
than camping.

06:36.733 --> 06:38.300
- What's this?

06:38.367 --> 06:41.400
- Oh, it's a bunch
of stuff that Josh left.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.633
I feel like I should
get it back to him.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.333

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
if you're looking
for an excuse to see him.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.933

06:48.067 --> 06:49.133

No.

Jeez, I'm a lesbian archive.

I'll get his stuff
back to him.

in the Achilles Forest.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.067
It's a chance to unplug,

talk to each other.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.133
I have no problem
being honest about who I am.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.133
So go ahead, don't hold back.
Say what you were gonna say.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.133
- Your tit's out.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.967
* *

09:41.367 --> 09:44.300
[upbeat music]

09:44.367 --> 09:47.100
* *

09:47.167 --> 09:49.300
- You feeling okay?
- Mm-hmm.

09:49.367 --> 09:51.200
Great.

09:51.267 --> 09:52.667
- Good morning,
and welcome to

09:52.733 --> 09:54.200
"The Future of Publishing"
panel.

09:54.267 --> 09:56.067
My first question
is for Millennial.

09:56.067 --> 09:58.100
What was your most innovative
marketing campaign

09:58.167 --> 09:59.600
of the past year?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.633
- Well, we did
an Instagram campaign,

10:01.700 --> 10:03.500
with influencers
posting "shelfies."

10:03.567 --> 10:05.667
That was quite successful.

10:05.733 --> 10:07.833
- "Shelfies"?
- People posting photos

10:07.900 --> 10:10.467
of their bookshelves,
because they want you to see

10:10.533 --> 10:11.967
what they're reading.
- Or at least pretending to.

10:12.033 --> 10:13.400
[scattered laughter]

10:13.467 --> 10:14.933
- Is there a book this year
you wish

10:15.000 --> 10:16.700
you'd gotten to publish,
but didn't?

10:16.767 --> 10:19.200
- Absolutely. Colin McNichol's
"The Algonquins"

10:19.267 --> 10:20.533
could've been a huge hit

10:20.600 --> 10:22.133
if they published
with Millennial,

10:22.200 --> 10:24.333
but instead,
they went with some big,

10:24.400 --> 10:26.867
mainstream publishing house
that fumbled the ball.

10:26.933 --> 10:28.533
- [chuckles]
Perhaps that's why no one

10:28.600 --> 10:30.333
from the aforementioned
publishing house

10:30.400 --> 10:31.967
is here at Bonfire.

10:32.033 --> 10:33.400
[crowd chuckles]

10:35.767 --> 10:38.700
[people conversing quietly]

10:38.767 --> 10:39.800
- Oh, excuse me.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.233
Ah--
Liza Miller?

10:41.300 --> 10:42.333
Right?
- Uh, yeah.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.800
- Hi.
Jay Mallick.

10:43.867 --> 10:45.967
I'm with Macmillan.
I saw the panel.

10:46.033 --> 10:48.133
Millennial's killing it.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.400
- Yeah, Kelsey's doing
an amazing job.

10:50.467 --> 10:53.400
- Mm-hmm, well...
she's not doing it alone.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.467
- Well, it is her baby.
- Right.

10:55.533 --> 10:57.667
And that's why
I wanted to talk to you.

10:57.733 --> 11:00.167
Look, Macmillan is launching
its own Gen-Y imprint,

11:00.233 --> 11:02.667
and we are looking
for someone to head it up.

11:02.733 --> 11:06.200
I don't mean to be too forward,
but would you be interested?

11:06.267 --> 11:07.700
- Me?

11:07.767 --> 11:10.067
- Okay, that was entirely
too forward.

11:10.067 --> 11:12.067
I'm sorry.
Um, let me just back up.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.800
[laughs]
Can I get you a drink?

11:14.867 --> 11:16.733
- Sure.
A drink sounds

11:16.800 --> 11:18.800
much more manageable.
- Oh, look, there's a bar.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.200
[both laugh]

11:20.267 --> 11:21.767
* *

11:21.833 --> 11:23.300
- * Front and center *

11:23.367 --> 11:25.067
* I represent her *

11:25.133 --> 11:26.433
* On the surface,
on the cover *

11:26.500 --> 11:28.067
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

11:28.133 --> 11:29.267
Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.067
- How's it going?
All right?

11:31.100 --> 11:32.800
- Good.
Thanks for bringing my stuff.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.433
- Yeah.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.067
- That's not mine, though.
- No, no, no.

11:36.067 --> 11:38.700
That's a gift.
There's a couple of flares

11:38.767 --> 11:41.100
in there, a pair
of women's long johns...

11:41.167 --> 11:43.067
- [laughs] Canteen?
- Yeah, knock yourself out.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.700
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

11:44.767 --> 11:45.867
- Thank you.
- [exhales]

11:45.933 --> 11:47.067
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.667
- Can I get you something?

11:48.733 --> 11:50.200
You get the friends-of-Maggie
discount.

11:50.267 --> 11:52.733
- Mm.
Yeah, I'll take an Americano.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.533
- Okay.
- Thanks.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.067
Damn.

11:58.133 --> 11:59.867
I see why you wanted
to get coffee here.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.067
- Yeah, she works
for me part time.

12:02.133 --> 12:03.767
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:03.833 --> 12:05.967
- She's hot.
- If you like straight girls

12:06.067 --> 12:07.833
with sexy hair.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.667
- That's kind of my thing.
- [inhales deeply]

12:09.733 --> 12:11.933
I'm sorry how it went down
with Liza.

12:12.067 --> 12:14.100
- Yeah.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.967
You mean how I caught her
cheating on me?

12:17.067 --> 12:18.500
- Yeah.
She messed up.

12:18.567 --> 12:20.100
But it wasn't that night.

12:20.167 --> 12:21.600
It was the night
that she met you at that bar

12:21.667 --> 12:23.267
and thought it was
just gonna be fun.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.333
I mean, you were way more
than she bargained for.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.100
- Well, she definitely
taught me a lot...

12:28.167 --> 12:31.100
like if someone tells you
they're a liar...

12:31.167 --> 12:33.067
you should believe them.

12:33.067 --> 12:35.200
- Yeah, well,
I'm exactly the same age

12:35.267 --> 12:36.667
that I told you that I was,

12:36.733 --> 12:38.667
so I hope we can
still be friends.

12:38.733 --> 12:40.600
- What are you talking about?
You never mentioned anything

12:40.667 --> 12:42.433
about your age.
- Yeah, let's keep it that way.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.900
- [chuckles]
All right.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.600
[birds chirping]

12:46.667 --> 12:48.433
- [laughing]
- Okay, okay--

12:48.500 --> 12:50.767
Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte,
and Virginia Woolf.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.133
Go.
- [groans]

12:52.200 --> 12:53.967
That is tough.
All right.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.733
Virginia would not be happy
either way, so...

12:55.800 --> 12:56.800
[slicing sound] She's gone.
- Mm.

12:56.867 --> 12:59.333
- And...I guess I am

12:59.400 --> 13:02.333
gonna marry Charlotte
and give it to Jane.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
- Nice.
- Yeah?

13:03.467 --> 13:04.700
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.067
- Excuse me.
- Okay, uh--

13:08.067 --> 13:09.533
- You've been talking
to that guy for over an hour.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.367
Move on.
- I've talked to other people.

13:11.433 --> 13:13.567
I talked to that independent
publisher from Indiana.

13:13.633 --> 13:16.467
- The nun?
- Her name's Sister Angela.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.367
She's got a really great story.

13:18.433 --> 13:21.233
- We got invited to Bonfire
because we're millennials,

13:21.300 --> 13:23.800
and our brand is young and fun.
So I'm gonna need you

13:23.867 --> 13:25.833
to be a little more
on-brand, okay?

13:25.900 --> 13:27.700
* *

13:27.767 --> 13:30.233
Keep up.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.467
- [sighs]
- Move.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.267
- [mumbling with mouth full]

13:33.333 --> 13:37.867
* *

13:37.933 --> 13:39.700
[knocking at door]

13:39.767 --> 13:41.633
[buzzer sounds]

13:44.300 --> 13:46.233
- You're my 7:00?
- Hi.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.600
I just thought since we work
in the same neighborhood...

13:48.667 --> 13:50.233
and we have
similar tastes in...

13:50.300 --> 13:52.400
- Men?
- Restaurants...

13:52.467 --> 13:54.200
we might bump into each other
from time to time,

13:54.267 --> 13:56.900
so I wanted to come in and clear
the air about something.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.900
- I'm listening.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.867
- When I told you
I was dating Richard,

14:03.933 --> 14:05.267
why did you laugh?

14:05.333 --> 14:07.633
- You weren't what
I was expecting.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.067
- How so?

14:09.067 --> 14:10.233
- When Richard left me

14:10.300 --> 14:12.433
after 18 years of marriage,

14:12.500 --> 14:15.233
he said he wanted
to recapture his youth.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.100
According to him,
that meant buying a truck,

14:17.167 --> 14:20.933
which is impractical
in the city, and...

14:21.067 --> 14:23.067
dating models.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.567
- Oh.
- So you can see why I laughed.

14:29.467 --> 14:31.233
[quirky music]

14:31.300 --> 14:32.733
- Thank you
for clearing that up.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.467
- That'll be $300.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.233
And I don't take insurance.

14:36.300 --> 14:41.300
* *

14:41.367 --> 14:43.733
- Some big, mainstream
publishing house

14:43.800 --> 14:45.400
just fumbled the ball!
- Hmm.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.800
- Right, Liza?
- Right, mm-hmm.

14:47.867 --> 14:50.267
- Oh!
- I'm gonna cut myself off.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.600
I've had four--already.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.267
I'm feeling a little
"whoo-whoo."

14:55.333 --> 14:56.800
- I've had six.

14:56.867 --> 15:00.367
And he has had six,
and Hat...

15:00.433 --> 15:02.733
has had, like,
seven or eight.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.067
Glass, please?
- All right,

15:06.067 --> 15:08.500
maybe I just need
something to eat.

15:08.567 --> 15:10.833
Okay, maybe not.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.933
- As I was saying...
- [retches, coughs]

15:13.067 --> 15:14.733
- Some big, mainstream company
fumbled it!

15:14.800 --> 15:15.967
- Ah...

15:17.600 --> 15:19.633
Uh...hey.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.600
- Hey.
Where's your glass?

15:21.667 --> 15:23.467
- I'm done.
- What--we're having

15:23.533 --> 15:25.300
a great time.
- I barfed, Kelsey.

15:25.367 --> 15:28.800
- Well, boot and rally.
- No, boot and go home.

15:28.867 --> 15:30.633
- [sighs]

15:30.700 --> 15:32.400
- [groans softly]

15:32.467 --> 15:34.800
- What is the problem, Liza?
Isn't this part of the fun?

15:34.867 --> 15:36.267
You get to relive
your glory years.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.733
You get to pretend
to be 27 again.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.367
- When I was 27,
I was married with a kid.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.067
I was boring.

15:43.100 --> 15:46.200
This is the drunkest
I've been in my entire life.

15:46.267 --> 15:48.133
I love my job,

15:48.200 --> 15:51.967
and I think
I'm pretty good at it.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.200
And if that isn't good enough
for you,

15:54.267 --> 15:55.967
then maybe
this isn't working.

15:56.067 --> 15:57.633
- Maybe it's not.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.700
[dance music]

16:00.767 --> 16:03.667

16:03.733 --> 16:06.767
- You can't--
that's crazy, right?

16:06.833 --> 16:08.233
You get--
- I'm interested.

[sassy music]

16:10.433 --> 16:12.433

16:12.500 --> 16:13.867
- I'll call you.

16:13.933 --> 16:15.667
- Oh, my God,
there's barf in here.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.600
[upbeat music]

16:21.667 --> 16:25.200
* *

16:25.267 --> 16:26.867
- Hey.

16:26.933 --> 16:29.700
Can, uh...can I still
get a drink, or...

16:29.767 --> 16:32.433
- We close in two minutes,
so can you drink fast?

16:32.500 --> 16:33.867
- Well, is there
any other place around here

16:33.933 --> 16:36.433
that stays open any later?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.067
- [laughing]
Yeah, I'm sure there are a lot--

16:38.133 --> 16:39.800
- [laughs]
- Lot of places.

16:39.867 --> 16:41.067
- Yeah.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.933
Will you be at any of them?

16:45.067 --> 16:46.900
- [laughs]

16:46.967 --> 16:49.367
- * Sitting, watching,
waiting, wishing *

16:49.433 --> 16:51.700

you never knew it *

16:51.767 --> 16:55.067
* At the back of the bus
there is so much to give *

16:55.133 --> 16:56.900
- We can, uh...

16:56.967 --> 16:59.267
we can skip the tour, right?
- Yeah.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.867
[giggles]

17:00.933 --> 17:02.633
* *

17:06.233 --> 17:09.500
- [breathes deeply]

17:18.133 --> 17:20.600
- I almost finished
an entire "New Yorker" article

17:20.667 --> 17:22.633
while you were in there.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.333
Is everything okay?

17:25.400 --> 17:26.700
- I met your ex-wife.

17:28.167 --> 17:29.500
- Winnie?

17:29.567 --> 17:31.633
- Is there more than one,
Richard?

17:31.700 --> 17:33.100
- No, uh...

17:34.933 --> 17:38.067
What happened?
- I introduced myself,

17:38.067 --> 17:41.667
and she proceeded
to laugh in my face.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.500
- Ah, well,
she was probably

17:43.567 --> 17:45.500
just flight-testing
some new meds.

17:45.567 --> 17:47.600
- She said it was because
when you left,

17:47.667 --> 17:51.800
you did so to pursue
the fantasy of dating...

17:51.867 --> 17:53.967
models.
[chuckles]

17:54.067 --> 17:56.200
- I said a lot
of ridiculous things

17:56.267 --> 17:57.767
when I left her.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.133
But then again,

18:02.200 --> 18:04.233
I did end up meeting
someone beautiful...

* *

18:06.967 --> 18:08.733
Inside and out.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.133
- I only care about out.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.700
- [chuckles]

18:11.767 --> 18:15.067
* *

18:15.133 --> 18:16.667
- [giggling]

18:16.733 --> 18:23.767

18:32.133 --> 18:34.367
- If I didn't know
your real age already,

18:34.433 --> 18:36.367
I would today.

18:36.433 --> 18:37.733
- I don't feel like talking.

18:49.667 --> 18:50.900
- [sighs]

18:53.200 --> 18:54.867
[phone chiming continuously]

18:54.933 --> 18:57.400
- Ah!
My God, we finally have service.

18:57.467 --> 19:00.567
[phone chiming]

19:06.200 --> 19:08.800
[phone chiming continuously]

19:08.867 --> 19:10.300
What's going on?

19:10.367 --> 19:12.200
- I'm sorry,
it's my daughter...

19:12.267 --> 19:14.200
[tense music]

19:14.267 --> 19:16.633
* *

19:16.700 --> 19:20.900
- What?
- She's in the hospital.

19:20.967 --> 19:23.267
[line ringing]

19:23.333 --> 19:25.267
Come on, answer, answer.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.267
- It's Caitlin--
holla at your girl.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.900
- Caitlin, it's your mom.
I'm on my way, okay?

19:29.967 --> 19:32.667
- Hey, what's going on?
- I think her appendix burst.

19:32.733 --> 19:34.533
- Oh, my God.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.533
[gentle music]

19:37.600 --> 19:42.533
* *

19:42.600 --> 19:44.067
- Here.
- Hey.

19:44.067 --> 19:45.567
I just spoke to Rose,
Caitlin's roommate.

19:45.633 --> 19:47.233
She's out of surgery.
- Is she okay?

19:47.300 --> 19:48.600
- [exhales]
I don't know.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.200
I think so.
She's gonna call me

19:50.267 --> 19:52.300
when she wakes up.
- So what happened?

19:52.367 --> 19:54.067
- [sighs]
Well, apparently,

19:54.067 --> 19:56.100
she didn't go to the doctor
when she first started

19:56.167 --> 19:57.767
having pain,
because she was afraid

19:57.833 --> 20:00.000
she wouldn't have enough money
for the deductible.

20:00.067 --> 20:02.900
God, I have been feeling
like a [bleep] person lately,

20:02.967 --> 20:04.867
and now I feel like
a really [bleep] mom.

20:04.933 --> 20:06.967
- No, Liza, there's nothing
that you could've done.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.200
She got sick.

20:08.267 --> 20:09.467
- I could've answered the phone

20:09.533 --> 20:10.867
and told her
to go to the doctor,

20:10.933 --> 20:12.433
but I was in the woods
getting drunk.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.767
- What about her dad?

20:16.833 --> 20:18.633
- He's not the one you contact
when you have a crisis.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.900
It's me.
It's always been me.

20:20.967 --> 20:22.567
- I'm really sorry.

20:25.467 --> 20:27.100
I wish there was
something I could do.

20:28.933 --> 20:32.067
[phone chiming]
- Oh, my God, it's her.

20:32.133 --> 20:34.767
Caitlin, hey.
- Hi, Mom.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.800
- Hey, hi!
You okay?

20:37.867 --> 20:39.600
- I've been better.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.567
- Ah, I am so sorry
I didn't get your call.

20:42.633 --> 20:44.433
- It's okay.
Are you coming?

20:44.500 --> 20:47.800
- I am on my way.
I promise.

20:47.867 --> 20:50.733
And, honey, just so you know,
when it comes to your health,

20:50.800 --> 20:52.400
money is not an issue.

20:52.467 --> 20:55.200
I am so, so sorry
you had to go through this.

20:55.267 --> 21:00.300
* *

21:03.600 --> 21:06.533
[dance music]

21:06.600 --> 21:09.133
* *

21:09.200 --> 21:11.200
- Hey.
Liza went hard at Bonfire,

21:11.267 --> 21:12.700
so I told her
to take the day off.

21:12.767 --> 21:17.067
- Oh, thanks so much
for thinking of me.

21:17.133 --> 21:18.967
- You would've been
so proud of her--

21:19.067 --> 21:20.933
she partied
with all the right people.

21:21.067 --> 21:23.833
- Oh.
I'm surprised.

21:23.900 --> 21:27.133
My bet was on you
for being queen of camp.

21:32.067 --> 21:34.133
[knocking at door]
- Hey, Charles?

21:34.200 --> 21:35.233
- Good morning.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.133
- You were right.
Liza definitely deserves

21:42.200 --> 21:43.433
that promotion.

21:46.767 --> 21:48.933
- What do you think about
bumping her title up

21:49.067 --> 21:50.600
to "associate editor"?

21:50.667 --> 21:52.600
- Yeah, that's great,
but she...

21:52.667 --> 21:54.400
also needs a raise.
- Ah.

21:54.467 --> 21:55.967
- You can take it out
of my salary if you need to.

21:56.067 --> 21:59.600
I could not do this job
without her.

21:59.667 --> 22:02.467
- That won't be necessary.
I'll find the money.

22:02.533 --> 22:06.267
[upbeat music]

22:06.333 --> 22:08.233
- She was lucky she got
to the hospital when she did.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.667
- Yeah, they had to irrigate
my abdomen, Maggie.

22:10.733 --> 22:13.567
- Ooh, that should keep you out
of classes for at least a week.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.533
- [chuckles]
- Oh, yeah.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.900
- How are you holding up?
- I am so lucky she had Rose.

22:20.967 --> 22:23.533
- A good roommate is key.
- Absolutely.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.533
- Hey, did you happen
to get Josh's stuff back?

22:26.600 --> 22:29.067
- Uh...

22:29.133 --> 22:30.267
- * Your love makes me *

22:30.333 --> 22:31.467
- I did.

22:31.533 --> 22:34.067
- * Someone else *

22:34.067 --> 22:35.700
* Whoa-oh *

22:35.767 --> 22:39.133
* Someone else,
oh, oh-oh *
