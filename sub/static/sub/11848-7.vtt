01:33.119 --> 01:34.460
All right!

01:35.544 --> 01:37.552
I'm gonna go drain a snake.

01:37.976 --> 01:41.073
Wally? Watch my beer.

01:41.159 --> 01:44.935
Why, you gonna have use the woods,
man, because the toilet's  broken!

01:47.563 --> 01:49.333
Bull shit!

01:58.504 --> 01:59.987
Howdy buddy?

02:57.956 --> 02:59.378
Hello!

03:00.556 --> 03:01.994
Hello there!

03:03.581 --> 03:05.167
Hello?

05:26.498 --> 05:27.887
Shut up!

05:27.888 --> 05:29.711
God damn it!

05:40.070 --> 05:42.330
Son of a bitch!

06:58.768 --> 07:00.260
Faraday?

07:01.462 --> 07:03.610
- Yeah?
- We're going out on a call.

07:04.335 --> 07:06.000
Why am I going out on a call?

07:06.001 --> 07:10.758
Einhron said to take you.
Said the call was a little... weird!

07:11.130 --> 07:13.360
So now I'm the weird call guy, huh?

07:13.361 --> 07:15.498
Yeah, cause you know you've
been so busy, he figured...

07:15.499 --> 07:16.597
Alright, alright.

07:16.632 --> 07:18.791
Alright.
Alright, alright, I'm coming.

07:19.497 --> 07:21.586
Okay.
What's so weird about this?

07:21.746 --> 07:23.865
- Possible dead body?
- Possible?

07:23.866 --> 07:24.844
Yeah, possible.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.656
Well, is there a dead guy
or isn't there a dead guy?

07:26.691 --> 07:30.049
- Caller said he didn't know what it was.
- Hooo... Spooky.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.015
And why couldn't
another uniform do this?

07:32.177 --> 07:35.253
It's out of our county.
Our patrols don't usually go that far

07:35.254 --> 07:37.523
- unless we get a call.
- And we got a call.

07:37.770 --> 07:42.084
- We got a call...
- Yeah, and we're the weird call guy, huh!

08:10.093 --> 08:12.438
I'm Detective Faraday.
This is the Officer Reed.

08:12.439 --> 08:13.911
I'm glad you came.

08:13.912 --> 08:16.172
- We've been waiting all morning.
- Right...

08:17.372 --> 08:18.910
Where is it?

08:18.911 --> 08:21.089
Where is what?

08:21.606 --> 08:25.143
- The Thing!
- Sure... Come on.

08:40.491 --> 08:43.561
Someone kicked the door in
or some kind of device.

08:43.562 --> 08:45.579
- Maybe a car crash.
- No, I don't think so.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.784
Looks like somebody broke
the door from the inside

08:47.785 --> 08:50.290
and then picked it up and tried
to put it back on, you know?

08:50.762 --> 08:52.843
What the hell could do that?

08:53.071 --> 08:55.760
- I don't know.
- Look.  The door ain't the problem.

08:55.761 --> 08:57.270
The problem's inside.

08:57.271 --> 09:00.370
Here!  Look for yourself.
I'll go around!

09:05.060 --> 09:06.427
Come on.

09:09.053 --> 09:10.494
Fine.

09:16.301 --> 09:18.118
Oh Jesus!

09:18.687 --> 09:20.895
Now tell me honestly buddy,

09:20.896 --> 09:22.532
what the fuck is that?

09:23.356 --> 09:27.611
I was thinking at first it
maybe a dead animal, but...

09:27.612 --> 09:29.995
but now I...

09:31.073 --> 09:32.466
What are you doing?

09:33.088 --> 09:35.270
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

09:36.399 --> 09:39.211
- Has anyone touched this or anything?
- No, no, no...

09:39.212 --> 09:42.257
- I made sure nobody fooled with it!
- Right.

09:56.193 --> 09:58.168
Holy shit!

10:04.503 --> 10:07.640
I think that was about 11:40
that he left with her and...

10:07.641 --> 10:10.188
- he looked out of it.
- Define "out of it".

10:10.189 --> 10:12.100
Drunk... He looked drunk.

10:12.667 --> 10:14.982
What more can you tell
me about this woman?

10:14.983 --> 10:16.887
Well, let me think...

10:17.186 --> 10:19.565
- Indian, I think.
- Indian?

10:19.566 --> 10:22.629
You know... American Indian like...
Native American.

10:22.896 --> 10:25.058
Right, I got it.
Go ahead.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.592
Long black hair.

10:26.708 --> 10:29.704
She had... sharp features.

10:29.705 --> 10:31.949
Like she was perfectly carved.

10:31.950 --> 10:34.273
Like someone really
took time making her.

10:34.424 --> 10:37.485
- Can I get her height?
- Well, she's maybe...

10:37.486 --> 10:40.863
5 foot 5, maybe 6...

10:40.864 --> 10:42.369
... and

10:42.911 --> 10:46.469
She was just... real sexy, you know?

10:47.207 --> 10:53.023
One of those where you look at it and all
you could think was "Man I got to hit that!"

10:54.146 --> 10:57.256
- I got to hit it!
- Pardon me, hit that?

10:57.628 --> 10:59.321
Fuck her!

10:59.822 --> 11:02.340
- Oh!
- Yeah.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.643
She had these eyes like a...

11:04.644 --> 11:06.813
Well, maybe they were contacts, but...

11:06.814 --> 11:09.115
maybe like yellow eyes, you know?

11:09.116 --> 11:13.215
- Okay, so. What?  Light brown?
- No, man!  Yellow.

11:13.471 --> 11:18.135
Like a... like a deer
caught in the headlights of your car.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.714
Right!

11:20.490 --> 11:23.324
- Who's in charge of the scene?
- That'll be me!

11:24.721 --> 11:26.256
Great!

11:27.826 --> 11:29.265
Well ...

11:29.266 --> 11:32.433
I hope you didn't manage to
lose the body or something.

11:32.434 --> 11:34.210
Nope.  Everything's copacetic.

11:34.423 --> 11:36.778
- Copacetic!
- Yeah, everything's cool.

11:36.781 --> 11:38.157
Whatever.

11:38.158 --> 11:41.019
- Just give me your notes.
- I thought Einhron was giving me this one.

11:41.888 --> 11:44.762
In your dreams, Dwight.
This one's on me.

11:44.763 --> 11:48.356
You see, I'd say this falls under the violent crimes category

11:48.357 --> 11:50.733
not insurance fraud or incest, or

11:50.734 --> 11:52.705
whatever bullshit they
got you up to these days.

11:52.706 --> 11:56.841
- Animal attacks.
- Right, sure.  Animal attacks...

11:57.286 --> 12:00.110
So tell me.  Does this look like
an animal attack to you?

12:00.111 --> 12:02.942
Actually they are telling me they
saw some deer over by the truck.

12:02.943 --> 12:06.229
Right, right.  So a deer
rips this guys truck door off,

12:06.230 --> 12:09.974
beats him with a sledgehammer till it
looks like surrealist art and then what?

12:10.075 --> 12:13.372
Retires to his chateau in the
woods to plan his next attack?

12:13.473 --> 12:14.738
I didn't ask for this, Carl.

12:14.839 --> 12:18.321
Whatever.  I came in begging for
a reason to get out of the station.

12:19.201 --> 12:21.954
Detective Patterson will
be taking over from me.

12:23.892 --> 12:25.542
Have a nice day.

12:30.905 --> 12:33.935
- I just got a call from the central...
- I know!  I know!  We're off the case.

12:34.036 --> 12:38.130
Yeah!  They want me back patrolling
Greenwood and you on an animal attack.

12:38.131 --> 12:39.525
What is it?

12:39.526 --> 12:42.610
Some old man's pet monkey
bit some old lady's dog!

12:42.611 --> 12:45.432
Now there's a royal rumble going down.

12:45.696 --> 12:47.824
They want you back at the station.

12:47.825 --> 12:49.727
Wonderful.

13:08.109 --> 13:10.224
Of course that was before
we moved to Seattle,

13:10.225 --> 13:12.261
and I'd never seen anyone
own a monkey there!

13:12.262 --> 13:14.936
I didn't even think owning
a monkey was legal, in fact!

13:14.937 --> 13:17.227
I think you'd better check that out.

13:17.410 --> 13:18.921
Yes, ma'am!

13:22.014 --> 13:25.088
Did you make a note of that?
If owning a monkey is illegal?

13:25.089 --> 13:27.432
Yes, ma'am.  I made a note
to check it out.  Yes, I did.

13:29.822 --> 13:31.824
Of course he's always
a vicious little thing!

13:31.825 --> 13:34.155
In fact he nearly
killed my neighbor's cat.

13:34.156 --> 13:37.937
He just picked it up and twirled it around
and around and round and hit that wall...

13:37.938 --> 13:39.485
That poor cat...

13:41.335 --> 13:44.185
I can't have 5 husbands
looking after this.

13:45.035 --> 13:46.452
Excuse me?

13:46.494 --> 13:49.973
- Excuse me!
- It started at the groin!

13:50.776 --> 13:52.785
What did you just say?

13:53.248 --> 13:54.902
The trampling!

13:54.903 --> 13:57.448
It was a trampling.  It started at
the groin and worked its way up

13:57.449 --> 14:00.468
and then back down the body,
maybe 15... 16 times!

14:00.469 --> 14:02.706
That's why it didn't
look like a body at first!

14:02.973 --> 14:05.804
The torso was shattered
and caved inwards.

14:05.805 --> 14:07.299
What?

14:08.371 --> 14:10.184
It's nice talking to you, ma'am.

14:15.010 --> 14:16.846
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.753
Did the morgue get in that
body from Red County yet?

14:22.754 --> 14:24.566
Yes, sir.
It's already on the table.

14:24.567 --> 14:27.112
The family has requested it but, we
just gonna keep it for a little longer.

14:27.113 --> 14:29.217
- See if we can dredge something up.
- What name is it under?

14:29.218 --> 14:31.421
The guy's name was Moltoy...

14:32.927 --> 14:34.963
Yeah! Henry Moltoy.

14:34.964 --> 14:36.797
Sign me in so I can take
a look at it, will you?

14:36.798 --> 14:39.122
They actually in the middle
of checking it out right now.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.855
Who is the...

14:40.856 --> 14:42.224
Dana!

14:42.629 --> 14:44.002
Great.

15:05.751 --> 15:07.325
Hey, Dana.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.146
Dana?

15:09.610 --> 15:11.028
Dana?

15:14.486 --> 15:15.919
Dana?

15:16.169 --> 15:17.873
Christ...

15:19.738 --> 15:23.056
I thought they stop letting
you wear your... face thing.

15:23.057 --> 15:26.444
Yeah, but no one else would take
this guy, so I figured... fuck 'em right?

15:26.674 --> 15:28.513
What do you mean,
no one else would take him?

15:28.514 --> 15:31.588
Just that. No one would stop look and look
at it for more than a couple of seconds.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.277
Aren't you people trained to
handle this kind of stuff?

15:34.486 --> 15:37.247
Yeah.
That's what I said.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.188
I should probably get that.

15:54.855 --> 15:56.501
Do you have the cause of death, yet?

15:56.502 --> 16:00.183
Well, massive blunt force trauma
would be sort of an obvious guess.

16:00.617 --> 16:03.458
This guy got levelled.
Well, it looks like a truck ran over him,

16:03.459 --> 16:06.333
- then backed over him and ran over him...
- I get it.

16:06.342 --> 16:08.118
- But it wasn't a truck.
- No.

16:08.119 --> 16:09.516
Have any clue what it was?

16:09.517 --> 16:13.424
Not the slightest, *** got
one thing for sure, so far.

16:13.425 --> 16:14.826
What's that?

16:14.827 --> 16:16.531
He died with a...

16:18.896 --> 16:21.017
He died in a state of arousal.

16:22.310 --> 16:24.040
How can you tell that?

16:26.436 --> 16:28.871
You see this?
That was his penis.

16:30.917 --> 16:33.542
You see these lines here?
These are stress fractures.

16:33.572 --> 16:35.537
You wouldn't see
those if he was flaccid.

16:35.565 --> 16:37.978
Something snapped his penis.

16:40.020 --> 16:42.802
- What do you mean "snapped"?
- I mean "snapped".

16:42.803 --> 16:45.410
- Kill that kind of thought.
- Here's Patterson's case?

16:45.415 --> 16:47.551
Yes, but I was first on the scene.

16:47.552 --> 16:49.776
And I have a... an interest.

16:49.777 --> 16:51.846
- So you're off homicides?
- I am.

16:51.847 --> 16:54.356
But there's a chance
this is an animal attack.

16:55.602 --> 16:57.372
Really?

16:58.340 --> 17:00.325
Yeah look!

17:00.326 --> 17:02.897
- What are you looking at?
- Now... just look.

17:06.271 --> 17:08.931
- Hoof prints!
- Hoof prints!

17:34.430 --> 17:36.990
I couldn't get a flight out
until tomorrow morning so...

17:36.991 --> 17:39.205
I'll have an early dinner
and call it a night.

17:39.635 --> 17:41.038
What?

17:41.095 --> 17:44.895
Well, right now I'm having
a scotch to celebrate the deal.

17:45.868 --> 17:47.239
Good.

17:47.644 --> 17:50.526
Alright.  Okay, I'll  see you
in the office on Thursday.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.797
Fine.  Goodbye.

17:57.146 --> 17:58.507
Hi!

18:00.920 --> 18:02.981
Can I buy you a drink?

18:08.140 --> 18:09.787
I bet I know what you want.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.880
A "Cosmopolitan".

18:13.761 --> 18:15.342
Am I right?

18:17.969 --> 18:20.683
Bartender?
A "Cosmopolitan" for the lady.

18:26.170 --> 18:30.909
I'm only here for one night.  Can you
recommend a good restaurant for dinner?

18:31.703 --> 18:33.613
Thank you, my good man.

18:35.350 --> 18:37.109
Cheers!

18:42.929 --> 18:44.999
So... are you...

18:45.000 --> 18:46.900
here all by yourself?

18:48.446 --> 18:51.737
Well this is... my lucky day.

18:53.429 --> 18:56.046
Would you care to join me for dinner?

19:03.026 --> 19:05.150
I can't believe how well this day is going.

19:09.876 --> 19:12.327
You want to go?

19:43.914 --> 19:47.783
Are you hungry...
Should we call room service?

20:04.784 --> 20:07.229
You don't fool around, do you?

20:20.264 --> 20:24.254
This is definitely my lucky day!

20:25.069 --> 20:27.979
So this man lures
a woman into the truck.

20:27.980 --> 20:31.949
He tries to have sex with her.
She gets mad and leaves...

20:33.074 --> 20:37.232
Then a deer comes and
stomps the man to death.

20:42.390 --> 20:44.454
Okay. Problems.
One:

20:44.455 --> 20:46.392
There's not a deer in the world
that could do that kind of damage.

20:46.393 --> 20:48.929
Two: There's something kicked
the door out from the inside.

20:48.930 --> 20:50.590
And three:
What happened to the girl?

20:50.597 --> 20:52.587
- She went home?
- How did she get home?

20:52.588 --> 20:55.998
She disappeared...
And where did the deer come from?

20:56.287 --> 20:59.318
Maybe the girl went cold she and
he had a deer hand as a replacement!

20:59.319 --> 21:02.795
It would be a lot easier to think of this
objectively if it wasn't so damn stupid.

21:02.796 --> 21:06.076
Maybe it was something else. You know,
I mean other animals have hooves.

21:06.094 --> 21:08.405
No.  Trust me.
Those are deer hooves.

21:08.406 --> 21:11.140
Maybe the girl beat him
to death with a deer leg.

21:13.513 --> 21:14.936
What's wrong?

21:14.937 --> 21:18.171
This is one of those sentences
that you never expect to hear.

21:18.172 --> 21:21.057
Well, I was just saying here.

21:21.371 --> 21:23.440
Okay, look it's 1 am.
We've been at this for hours,

21:23.441 --> 21:25.672
and the best we had
was murder by taxidermy.

21:25.673 --> 21:28.352
Okay. I'm...
I should be home in bed.

21:28.353 --> 21:31.384
- And I should be out partying!
- Right.

21:31.731 --> 21:34.168
- Thanks for your time, Dana.
- Not a problem.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.552
So...

21:35.553 --> 21:38.374
- Are you going to ask to be reassigned or...?
- No.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.821
No, it's just a hunch.

21:40.891 --> 21:44.709
No, tomorrow's back to
dog bites and lost cats.

22:52.860 --> 22:54.596
Ah, it's right here.

22:54.615 --> 22:56.515
You see this little lady right here?

22:58.374 --> 22:59.740
After you.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.071
Stupid!

24:12.789 --> 24:14.288
Did you hear something?

24:17.977 --> 24:19.614
No!

24:25.149 --> 24:27.557
No, wait.
I definitely heard something.

24:30.805 --> 24:34.056
No, you didn't. Come on.
Let's get in the truck.

24:36.357 --> 24:37.756
There you go.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.837
Here it is again.

24:51.334 --> 24:53.344
It's over there.

25:03.147 --> 25:05.238
Retarded...

25:08.182 --> 25:09.815
Come here.

25:18.688 --> 25:20.123
Wait!

25:21.061 --> 25:23.051
Did you hear something?

25:24.225 --> 25:25.900
No...

25:25.901 --> 25:27.998
- Go...
- Okay.

25:30.604 --> 25:33.576
- Hey.
- What?

25:33.611 --> 25:35.752
I didn't leave the door unlock.

26:43.085 --> 26:44.985
Fuck!

27:21.313 --> 27:23.580
Can I help you?

27:45.253 --> 27:48.335
-  Yo Dwight?
- Yeah... yes... What?

27:48.559 --> 27:49.796
What is it?

27:49.797 --> 27:52.779
I just thought you should know they
found another one of those things.

27:52.780 --> 27:54.390
Pardon me, what things?

27:54.391 --> 27:57.686
Another one of those "hamburger"
things, you know?  Trampled to death.

27:58.007 --> 27:59.970
They just brought in
the body this morning.

27:59.971 --> 28:04.460
I only know because Patterson was having a
hissy fit about you playing with his corpse.

28:04.461 --> 28:07.618
- Hey, I didn't play with it.
- Hey, whatever, man.

28:10.447 --> 28:13.735
Tell me honestly.  Why aren't
you ever doing anything?

28:13.736 --> 28:16.657
- Excuse me?
- I've been here for five months.

28:16.856 --> 28:20.306
Up until yesterday,
I talked to you twice.

28:20.831 --> 28:22.570
But I see you every day.

28:22.571 --> 28:26.316
You're always sitting right there
and your eyes always right about...

28:26.317 --> 28:28.322
... there.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.213
What's your point, Reed?

28:30.657 --> 28:35.822
Well, I've never heard of a detective that
was assigned exclusively to animal attacks.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.967
- What happened?
- A lot happened.

28:40.105 --> 28:42.802
- May we delve?
- No.

28:42.803 --> 28:44.717
Oh man, you're no fun...

28:48.926 --> 28:52.354
- Is that your wife?
- We are separated, actually.

28:52.795 --> 28:57.255
- Shit!  I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it, man.

28:57.290 --> 29:01.111
- What are you doing right now?
- Me...?

29:01.815 --> 29:03.884
Bothering you, I guess.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.449
I was supposed to go down to the firing
range but... I don't have much to do...

29:07.450 --> 29:10.242
You want  go down to the morgue
and take a look at the new cadaver?

29:11.711 --> 29:16.242
That's not the sort
of stuff I do for fun.

29:21.437 --> 29:22.674
Christ!

29:22.675 --> 29:24.317
Start working the highway, Reed!

29:24.318 --> 29:26.664
It will toughen you up a
little bit to stuff like this.

29:26.699 --> 29:29.812
Same MO...
Basically massive blunt force trauma,

29:29.813 --> 29:32.184
died in a state of arousal,
you know the deal...

29:32.185 --> 29:33.767
But then...

29:35.067 --> 29:37.304
I found this.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.671
Under his fingernails.

29:43.823 --> 29:47.002
- That can't be human hair!
- Yeah!  It's deer hair!

29:47.003 --> 29:48.384
Deer hair!

29:48.385 --> 29:51.287
Yeah, looks like it got
pulled out during a struggle.

29:51.781 --> 29:52.842
Hmm.

29:52.897 --> 29:54.152
Hmm?

29:54.387 --> 29:58.041
Someone gets sliced and diced in a
struggle with a deer in a hotel room,

29:58.042 --> 30:00.280
and your response is "hmm"?

30:00.733 --> 30:03.493
- He was in a hotel?
- That's what it said in the file.

30:03.494 --> 30:05.640
So we must have witnesses
saying they saw him there right?

30:05.641 --> 30:07.679
- Yeah, with a girl.
- You have a description?

30:07.680 --> 30:09.469
We have three...

30:10.922 --> 30:13.249
- Dark skin, long dark hair?
- You got it.

30:13.250 --> 30:14.812
Well, that's about all
they have in common,

30:14.813 --> 30:17.359
We got 3 different heights,
3 different weights,

30:17.360 --> 30:20.597
although they all agree
she was gorgeous.

30:20.939 --> 30:25.354
Hey, I'm starting to see what
you say about those hooves.

30:25.355 --> 30:28.424
Some big animal did
a tap dance on this guy.

30:28.425 --> 30:30.576
Is there any way we can
tell how big the deer was?

30:30.577 --> 30:33.826
Alright, so we're definitely
calling the perp a deer now?

30:35.102 --> 30:37.570
A deer or a...
deer type animal.

30:37.571 --> 30:38.940
Well, what about the woman?

30:38.941 --> 30:41.781
I don't know about the woman yet.
I'm still thinking about the woman.

30:41.821 --> 30:44.855
There's no real way to call
the size, at least as I know of...

30:44.856 --> 30:48.653
But the hairs were short, which probably
mean she was either young or small.

30:48.654 --> 30:53.042
Oh no, no. There's no way anything
under 300 lbs did this to him!

30:53.043 --> 30:55.371
I mean... This was a big guy.

30:55.372 --> 30:57.776
- You know it's not like he was...
- Maybe it's strong.

30:57.777 --> 31:01.195
Really strong.  It kicked the
door clean off that 18 wheeler.

31:01.196 --> 31:04.650
So wait!  The girl smuggles a deer
in the room under her coat...

31:04.651 --> 31:07.313
Stop with the girl.  We're not
thinking about the girl yet.

31:07.314 --> 31:09.323
- We're still on the weapon.
- Weapon?

31:09.358 --> 31:12.824
Man, I thought we agreed
on an animal attack?

31:12.920 --> 31:14.677
Yeah... buddy.

31:19.291 --> 31:21.771
We got another one of
those messy ones, Dana.

31:24.533 --> 31:27.314
- Hello, Faraday.
- So soon?

31:27.739 --> 31:30.859
It's just in.  I brought it into Room 1,
but they said you were handling this.

31:30.860 --> 31:32.223
Great.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.039
Don't feel bad.
I'm still the weird calls guy.

31:35.611 --> 31:38.740
What?  So, you're not
going to say hello to me?

31:39.342 --> 31:42.942
I said "Hello"!   You
should say "Hello" back..

31:43.390 --> 31:45.378
I don't even know your name.

31:46.145 --> 31:48.061
I'm Bill!

31:49.737 --> 31:51.909
And you still should
have said "Hello"!

31:52.275 --> 31:55.455
- But I didn't know...
- When did this one arrive?

31:55.456 --> 31:57.396
About 15 minutes ago.

31:57.397 --> 32:01.145
Now there are still officers on the scene
but Patterson, had the coroner

32:01.146 --> 32:04.209
take the body away because
there was a crowd there...

32:04.375 --> 32:07.235
Still having trouble
finding one of his arms.

32:07.236 --> 32:08.734
That's creepy!

32:09.254 --> 32:10.716
You're driving.

32:37.776 --> 32:39.609
What the fuck!

32:44.609 --> 32:46.958
At least we found the arm.

32:49.216 --> 32:51.210
Oh boys?

32:54.737 --> 32:56.529
Fuches? What's up?

32:56.530 --> 32:58.784
What are you doing here?
This is me and Patterson's case.

32:58.785 --> 33:02.253
- Calm down.  We're just checking it out.
- No you're not!  Go on, get out of here.

33:02.783 --> 33:04.286
Where did they find the body?

33:04.287 --> 33:07.066
I'm not telling you.
Find your own way around.

33:07.067 --> 33:08.877
Dwight!

33:09.391 --> 33:10.480
On the roof.

33:10.481 --> 33:12.817
Whoo, first names!

33:18.412 --> 33:20.695
Faraday?  What the hell
are you doing here?

33:20.696 --> 33:24.080
- I'm just looking around.
- We just one of them crime scene,
a crime scene these days.

33:24.081 --> 33:28.113
- Hey, calm down, man.
- Calm down?  He just ambles in
here, I'm suppose to calm...

33:28.114 --> 33:29.774
Come to think of it,
who the hell are you?

33:29.775 --> 33:32.188
- Excuse me...
- I'm Officer Reed.

33:32.354 --> 33:35.088
Reed?  Didn't I seen your
name on street beat?

33:35.089 --> 33:36.478
What are you doing
loitering around my...

33:36.479 --> 33:39.641
Detective Faraday has just as
much of a right to be here as you.

33:39.825 --> 33:42.038
He had the first one of these...

33:42.442 --> 33:44.384
- These things!
- Murders!

33:44.669 --> 33:47.855
Have you seen the bodies?
You think a human did that?

33:47.856 --> 33:50.479
Or would you prefer me to ...

33:55.542 --> 33:58.049
Faraday, what the fuck are you doing?

33:58.344 --> 34:00.122
Get off my roof!

34:02.730 --> 34:06.614
- Good night ladies!  Drive safely!
- Shut up Fuches!

34:07.673 --> 34:10.108
I can drop you off
before I turn the car in.

34:10.109 --> 34:12.927
No, no thanks.  I live about a mile
from here, you know.  I'll walk.

34:12.928 --> 34:15.143
- You sure.
- Yeah, it'll do me good to clear my head.

34:15.174 --> 34:17.120
Okay.  Get some sleep.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.641
You too.

34:58.246 --> 35:01.505
Now, now I'm... definitely losing it.

35:17.151 --> 35:19.669
Give me your wallet, asshole,
or I will cut you!

35:19.670 --> 35:21.638
Okay! Okay, okay...

35:23.742 --> 35:27.469
You motherfucker!  You almost
gave me a goddamn heart attack.

35:27.470 --> 35:29.237
- Listen.  Don't shoot me.
- Don't shoot you?

35:29.238 --> 35:31.468
Don't you know better
than to mug a policeman?

35:31.469 --> 35:33.674
You don't look like a cop.

35:33.826 --> 35:36.502
You know, I was going to call backup and
have you booked, but you know what?

35:36.503 --> 35:37.830
What?

35:39.850 --> 35:43.066
- You fucking stabbed me!
- Don't pull it out!

35:43.190 --> 35:46.910
There's a hospital about 4 blocks from
here.  Have the doctors remove it.

35:46.911 --> 35:51.043
When that arm heals up, get a job
and stay off the goddamn street.

35:56.924 --> 35:59.157
What the fuck was that!

36:01.790 --> 36:04.692
All I'm saying is that we
cannot rule out an animal attack.

36:04.693 --> 36:07.623
Weren't you just saying that
this was a sexual assault homicide?

36:07.624 --> 36:11.054
Yes, well that's true too.  Maybe
some sort of an animal sexual assault.

36:11.055 --> 36:12.275
Oh boy! Here we go...

36:12.276 --> 36:16.475
I think your private fantasy life is beginning
to interfere with your work, Faraday!

36:16.476 --> 36:18.165
Shut up, Fuches!

36:18.301 --> 36:21.838
Look, I'm being serious.  Dana down at
forensics says the blows are hoof shape.

36:21.839 --> 36:24.449
Oh, right.  Dana...
That pillar of sanity!

36:24.450 --> 36:28.587
The blows are circular,
the hooves are oval...

36:28.588 --> 36:30.608
- And I don't think that...
- Shut up, Fuches!

36:32.105 --> 36:34.795
The murder weapon is hoof shaped.
I'll give you that one.

36:34.796 --> 36:38.492
But the blows hit these guys with a
tremendous amount of force behind them.

36:38.493 --> 36:42.061
For an animal of that size and strength
to be hiding in a major metropolitan area

36:42.262 --> 36:45.176
for any extended amount of
time is frankly impossible.

36:45.177 --> 36:48.646
It is possible! It's very possible!
This could be an unknown animal.

36:48.647 --> 36:51.501
Some kind of a mutant
hoofed quadruped.

36:51.502 --> 36:53.760
Oh great!  We got killer moose
man roaming the streets.

36:53.861 --> 36:56.865
- A new animal! A new kind of animal.
One that we haven't seen before.
- Alright.

36:56.983 --> 36:59.519
- That's enough.
- In London in 1981,

36:59.520 --> 37:02.649
a series of brutal animal attacks
were directly linked to a  freak wolf

37:02.650 --> 37:06.059
- that was gunned down in Piccadilly Circus.
- I'm familiar with the case.

37:06.060 --> 37:07.619
Then what makes this so different?

37:07.620 --> 37:10.251
Because this is not 1981.
This is not London.

37:10.252 --> 37:12.793
These men weren't bitten,
or clawed or even scratched.

37:12.794 --> 37:15.436
They were pounded
into fucking mince meat!

37:15.437 --> 37:18.197
Then how do you explain the bloody hoof
prints that were found at the scene?

37:18.494 --> 37:19.374
I don't know.

37:19.375 --> 37:22.514
They were way too far apart for anything
that I know with hoofs to have made them.

37:22.549 --> 37:25.209
My bet is, they're from the perp
dragging the weapon on the ground.

37:25.210 --> 37:28.244
That is ridiculous. The distance
between the hoof print, suggests

37:28.245 --> 37:29.922
an animal that was moving on two legs.

37:29.923 --> 37:33.621
A biped that was leaping
or... jumping like a deer.

37:33.622 --> 37:37.234
And I can't believe you're taking this
dragged weapon theory seriously, come on.

37:37.235 --> 37:39.150
As opposed to your Minotaur theory?

37:39.830 --> 37:41.235
Minotaur! That's funny.

37:41.236 --> 37:43.674
Look chief.  All I'm asking is
the next time it happens,

37:43.675 --> 37:45.770
let me be first on the scene.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.597
- Are you calling Dips?
- Yeah, I'm calling Dips.

37:48.598 --> 37:50.771
What makes you sure
there'll be a next time?

37:51.537 --> 37:54.274
Two days, 3 bodies.  I seriously
doubt that the killer this brutal

37:54.275 --> 37:56.013
is gonna stop without
having being caught.

37:56.014 --> 37:58.216
Oh... and you're the one
to catch him, right?

37:58.920 --> 38:01.315
- Christ! Can you have your push-up?
- Or shave?

38:01.687 --> 38:03.020
Shut up, Fuches!

38:03.021 --> 38:04.409
Right.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.629
Because I remember you
being a half decent detective

38:08.630 --> 38:11.001
at one time, you've got it.

38:12.014 --> 38:14.996
- Come on!  This is a bullshit!
- You're shit!

38:14.997 --> 38:16.709
Faraday, please watch your back!

38:16.710 --> 38:19.147
That's enough.
It's Faraday's case.

38:20.155 --> 38:21.489
Yes, sir...

38:21.776 --> 38:23.137
I can't hear you.

38:23.644 --> 38:24.964
Yes, sir.

38:24.968 --> 38:26.308
Now...

38:26.320 --> 38:28.397
Do either of you know
anything about this guy

38:28.398 --> 38:31.489
who claims he was
attacked by a cop with a knife?

38:50.620 --> 38:54.104
Dana has the results from the
autopsy of the body on the roof.

38:54.105 --> 38:55.839
Guess what she found.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.461
- What?
- Guess.

38:57.462 --> 39:00.752
- How the hell am I supposed to guess?
- Deer DNA.

39:01.212 --> 39:02.944
Deer DNA?

39:03.429 --> 39:05.426
Deer DNA.

39:05.668 --> 39:08.954
- What does that mean?
- You're Sherlock, man. I'm just Watson!

39:11.030 --> 39:13.723
It's pretty quiet around here.
You want to catch some lunch?

39:13.724 --> 39:16.679
The new Indian Casino
feeds officers free.

39:16.680 --> 39:19.154
You mean the new Native
American Casino, right?

39:19.155 --> 39:23.611
They make enough money off the slots
to feed a couple of brothers in blue, right?

39:24.826 --> 39:26.136
Let's go.

39:26.137 --> 39:30.369
Howdy and welcome
to River Rock Casino.

39:30.370 --> 39:34.415
I'm Steve, your official greeter
here in River Rock.

39:34.416 --> 39:39.915
Say, did you hear the one about the
Indian brave who went to a psychiatrist?

39:39.916 --> 39:44.585
He said: Doctor, I don't know if
I'm a wigwam or a teepee.

39:44.586 --> 39:50.097
The psychiatrist replied:
My son, you're Two Tense!

39:54.476 --> 39:58.043
Say, why not try our
steak and lobster buffet?

39:58.228 --> 40:01.583
Or dance your troubles away to music,

40:01.584 --> 40:03.861
mirth and magic tones.

40:03.862 --> 40:09.613
Now performing 3 shows nightly in the
River Rock spectacular Pow-Wow Room.

40:30.256 --> 40:31.700
Please.

40:34.294 --> 40:35.683
Thank you.

40:40.626 --> 40:42.046
Okay. Here's the story.

40:42.833 --> 40:47.757
Back when I was still in homicide, I was
partnered with a guy named Ted Niman.

40:47.758 --> 40:51.228
A sweet guy... smart, you know.
He's really going places.

40:51.229 --> 40:53.387
He started criminal justice
classes because he wanted to be

40:53.388 --> 40:54.766
a crime fiction writer.

40:54.767 --> 40:57.134
Just sort of fall in love with it.

40:57.735 --> 41:00.898
Anyway we were following up lead on
this murder gang. And it's no big deal...

41:00.899 --> 41:03.433
You know it's just a little
drug deal thing... you know.

41:08.013 --> 41:11.639
Anyway, we found an address
on this guy named Dykon Barlow.

41:12.096 --> 41:14.017
When we got there, we...

41:14.018 --> 41:15.909
We should have radioed for
backup, but we didn't.

41:15.922 --> 41:18.324
Ted went round the back,
I went on the front and...

41:18.929 --> 41:20.883
Trouble started right away
and it was crazy.

41:20.884 --> 41:23.085
Crack got is running every which way.

41:23.724 --> 41:25.712
And of course, one of them decides
he's not afraid of the cops, right.

41:25.713 --> 41:29.693
So he runs on me with a pistol.  A little
white guy, bright red hair, you know?

41:29.694 --> 41:32.489
Must have been about 95 pounds...

41:33.883 --> 41:35.756
And I don't have my gun out.

41:35.968 --> 41:37.491
Like, so I'm basically...

41:37.492 --> 41:39.890
running away a couple of seconds
so I can pull the Glock

41:39.891 --> 41:42.453
and by then he chased me into
this narrow hallway and I just...

41:42.454 --> 41:44.974
I turned and I fired
my gun three times.

41:45.512 --> 41:48.451
One shot missed, the other
two hit him here and... here.

41:48.452 --> 41:50.561
I'm still rushing off the adrenaline,

41:51.215 --> 41:54.642
and was scared to death of some junky's
gonna jump out at me out of nowhere and then

41:54.643 --> 41:58.095
I... I saw Ted.
My partner, Ted.

42:00.148 --> 42:02.629
He was lying on the floor
and back of the junky.

42:05.172 --> 42:08.786
Bullets went through the
guy and they... both hit Ted.

42:11.910 --> 42:14.350
So there was this big
investigation, you know, and...

42:15.072 --> 42:17.954
For a while, a few people
said that I planned it, right.

42:18.164 --> 42:20.475
That I meant to shoot Ted.

42:20.814 --> 42:23.064
You know, eventually the whole
thing was dismissed as an accident,

42:23.065 --> 42:25.349
and people don't forget so easily.

42:26.704 --> 42:29.833
Einhron took me off active duty and
by the time he let me come back,

42:30.079 --> 42:32.262
I was on animal attacks.

42:33.689 --> 42:35.641
So I was pretty fucked up
and was sick of it... you know...

42:35.642 --> 42:39.217
and I was always out of it and doped
on anti-depressants.  My wife left me,

42:39.218 --> 42:41.590
and I lost touch with
most of my friends and...

42:41.828 --> 42:45.209
And then I had this...
This kind of a...

42:45.407 --> 42:48.319
- realization.
- An epiphany.

42:50.246 --> 42:54.111
I just realized that we all have our time
to make our mark on this planet, you know?

42:54.641 --> 42:57.645
And all that I'd done
with my time was...

42:58.533 --> 43:01.044
get a decent man killed.

43:01.712 --> 43:04.050
That's the mark I made on the Earth.

43:04.337 --> 43:06.261
That's dark!

43:06.922 --> 43:08.493
Yeah, well...

43:09.843 --> 43:11.349
Shit!

43:11.773 --> 43:13.937
Oh, now we got our
special sharing time.

43:13.949 --> 43:17.210
Let's figure out what the deer
monster has against horny men.

43:17.530 --> 43:19.442
Now this girl...

43:19.443 --> 43:20.920
This girl bothers me.

43:20.921 --> 43:23.669
Whatever is happening to these men,
it's happened because of her.

43:23.786 --> 43:25.220
Right.

43:27.646 --> 43:31.162
- Maybe it's not a woman.
- What?

43:31.263 --> 43:33.525
There's this type of spider
looks just like an ant.

43:33.526 --> 43:35.837
Okay, builds this fake
ant-holes and hides in them,

43:35.838 --> 43:37.599
waits for the real ants
to follow them down...

43:37.716 --> 43:39.366
And then chomp!

43:39.367 --> 43:40.681
Right.

43:40.720 --> 43:44.047
So you're saying the deer monster
pretends to be a beautiful woman,

43:44.048 --> 43:48.076
lures guys to somewhere secluded
and then stomps the shit out of them?

43:48.579 --> 43:51.701
- I don't know...
- Alright!  Deer woman!

43:51.761 --> 43:54.065
Woh woh what?... You know
the Deer woman?

43:54.066 --> 43:56.974
- How you guys listen to stuff like that?
- And to stuff like what?

43:56.975 --> 43:59.588
You know, Native American mythology.
You know, the Deer Woman.

43:59.589 --> 44:03.041
the Piasa Thunderbirds, the Olgoya,
you know, stuff like that!

44:03.471 --> 44:04.903
Seat down.

44:04.904 --> 44:06.800
- I got to...
- No no no! It's okay, please.

44:06.801 --> 44:09.198
- Sit down.
- Yeah, I guess I got a minute.

44:16.340 --> 44:19.880
What you heard us talking about isn't
a legend.  It's a case we're working on.

44:20.372 --> 44:23.854
Okay, somebody is killing people in
the city, trampling them to death.

44:23.855 --> 44:26.125
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I saw that on the news.

44:28.447 --> 44:33.313
- You guys think that's the Deer Woman?
- What is a Women Deer exactly?

44:33.314 --> 44:36.499
Okay.  Here is the story
how my dad used to tell it.

44:36.500 --> 44:39.591
When the Pohonkians would get together,
you know, for a big social gathering,

44:39.592 --> 44:43.372
the Deer Woman would come out of the
woods and slip unnoticed into the party.

44:43.732 --> 44:46.514
She's like the most beautiful
woman in the world.

44:46.515 --> 44:49.236
Really sexy, built like a
goddess from the waist up.

44:49.237 --> 44:51.388
But from the waist down
she's like a deer.

44:51.389 --> 44:54.654
- A deer?
- Well, you know, she has deer legs...

44:56.260 --> 45:00.162
- Four legs or two?
- You guys can't be serious!

45:00.163 --> 45:01.942
We're very serious.

45:02.767 --> 45:06.509
Two legs.  Anyway, she comes in
to the party, she finds a guy.

45:06.945 --> 45:10.604
She lures him out somewhere secluded,
bangs him, and then tramples him to death.

45:10.605 --> 45:12.905
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

45:13.252 --> 45:15.375
Hey, it's just a story...

45:15.376 --> 45:17.599
How come no one notices
she has deer legs?

45:17.600 --> 45:20.140
- She keeps them covered up.
- Why? Why does she do it?

45:20.141 --> 45:21.443
What's her motive?

45:21.444 --> 45:24.156
Why does everything have to
have a why with you people?

45:24.157 --> 45:27.734
You know, it's a woman with deer legs.
Murder really isn't an issue here.

45:27.775 --> 45:29.171
Okay.

45:29.172 --> 45:31.582
- How do they catch her?
- What do you mean "catch her"?

45:31.583 --> 45:34.517
Well you know, how does the legend end.
How do they kill the deer woman?

45:34.518 --> 45:36.646
They don't!

45:39.619 --> 45:44.327
She just kills everyone who she seduces and
then she disappears back into the forest.

45:45.197 --> 45:46.508
Right.

45:46.551 --> 45:50.245
This is just some silly ** in this
Pohonkin legend and you two

45:50.246 --> 45:53.030
are acting like this is a serious
theory in a criminal case.

45:53.708 --> 45:55.690
Actually, it's our only
theory at the moment.

46:04.319 --> 46:08.266
I'm going home, shower and change
and get completely drunk!

46:08.267 --> 46:10.085
What's the matter?
This case is getting to you?

46:10.086 --> 46:12.795
Look.
Every legend is based in fact.

46:12.796 --> 46:14.946
Every legend is not based in fact.

46:14.947 --> 46:18.188
If you take that attitude, we're
never going to get anywhere.

46:22.675 --> 46:25.509
Look, I get off soon.  I'm
thinking about coming back.

46:25.522 --> 46:26.966
Maybe hitting the slots...

46:26.967 --> 46:29.699
You want to come?
A little drinking, a little gambling...

46:29.700 --> 46:33.562
- I don't gamble?.
- Didn't you see how they
were paying off in there?

46:33.563 --> 46:35.237
You saw one person win.

46:35.238 --> 46:36.729
So now you're going to
come back and play,

46:36.730 --> 46:39.225
thinking you're going to win
like the one person you saw win!

46:39.260 --> 46:41.108
Out of the hundreds of
people who are doing there?

46:41.109 --> 46:42.009
That's correct!

46:42.010 --> 46:44.383
It's people like you that
make America great.

46:44.953 --> 46:47.166
Want to bet?

47:06.728 --> 47:08.683
Working nights now, Faraday?

47:08.684 --> 47:13.047
- Not now, Fuches!
- Fuck, I'm sorry for being such
an asshole to you earlier.

47:13.048 --> 47:16.378
The more I look at this case,
the more it seems bizarre.

47:16.773 --> 47:18.703
Yeah, to say the least...

47:20.917 --> 47:23.561
- Have a good night.
- You too.

47:24.270 --> 47:25.692
Asshole!

47:37.959 --> 47:39.339
Shit!

47:54.269 --> 47:55.711
Excuse me, ma'am?

47:58.379 --> 48:02.729
- Can I get a "7 and 7" please?
- Well, I don't see why not.

48:03.450 --> 48:05.503
50 dollars worth of chips, please.

48:05.504 --> 48:07.326
Here we go, new shooter coming out.

48:07.508 --> 48:10.285
Any ** last chance.

48:15.290 --> 48:16.760
Here we go.

48:19.360 --> 48:20.923
Shit!

48:22.562 --> 48:24.234
Okay, here we go.

48:25.269 --> 48:27.614
- Thank you.
- Ah, thank you!

48:34.487 --> 48:37.093
Should I play the 7?

48:39.207 --> 48:40.910
Lady, you're the boss.

48:40.911 --> 48:42.351
Here we go.

48:46.889 --> 48:48.449
How about that?

48:53.297 --> 48:54.760
Here we go.

48:57.353 --> 48:59.625
That's what I'm talking about!

49:03.448 --> 49:05.083
You want me to let it run?

49:10.643 --> 49:11.962
Okay.

49:11.963 --> 49:14.088
The lady said let it run.

49:17.577 --> 49:21.440
Alright lady!  Where have
you been all my life?

49:23.940 --> 49:25.543
Yes! Yes!

49:29.051 --> 49:32.758
- Hey lucky? How about another round?
- Yeah!  For everybody...

49:53.900 --> 49:56.348
Oh, man!
You are beautiful!

50:01.245 --> 50:03.965
Dammit!  I've got to get that.

50:04.611 --> 50:07.696
I know, baby, but it's my job,
I got to get to the phone...

50:09.520 --> 50:12.420
Hold on, baby.
I'm not going anywhere!

50:20.076 --> 50:22.305
- Hello?
- Are you Reed?

50:22.475 --> 50:23.966
Dwight?

50:23.967 --> 50:25.867
Look, I've been doing some research.

50:26.816 --> 50:28.568
That's good, Dwight.
I'll see you tomorrow.

50:28.569 --> 50:30.022
<i>This has happened here before.</i>

50:30.023 --> 50:33.422
<i>Okay, about a hundred years ago,
11 workers were found pulverized.</i>

50:33.423 --> 50:35.072
They had all been seen
with a pretty woman.

50:35.073 --> 50:36.505
Dwight?

50:36.585 --> 50:39.004
I'm a little drunk and
something's came up.

50:40.336 --> 50:42.693
<i>No, I'm thinking we should put
some officers in clubs and bars</i>

50:42.694 --> 50:44.481
<i>and on the streets, you know?</i>

50:45.285 --> 50:47.307
I'm a little busy now.

50:48.496 --> 50:53.343
I've got a girl in here, man!
I will call you tomorrow!

50:54.129 --> 50:55.869
Have you seen her feet?

50:56.261 --> 50:57.612
Say what?

50:57.984 --> 51:00.579
Do you know her?
Have you seen her feet?

51:03.947 --> 51:06.268
Reed?
Are you there?

51:06.895 --> 51:10.206
- I'm a fucking idiot, Dwight!
- Where's your gun?

51:11.019 --> 51:12.800
Call backup!

51:12.801 --> 51:15.316
Reed.  Reed!

51:21.932 --> 51:24.937
Request backup in
35-81 Minery.

51:24.938 --> 51:26.410
Copy that.

51:35.496 --> 51:37.142
Fuck me!

51:59.832 --> 52:01.177
Reed?

52:02.462 --> 52:03.825
Reed?

52:05.684 --> 52:07.092
Reed?

52:14.151 --> 52:15.685
Oh, my God!

52:19.816 --> 52:23.905
Officer down.  Repeat,
officer down at  35-81 Minery.

52:24.302 --> 52:25.619
... Apartment 406

52:35.254 --> 52:37.068
What have I done?

53:20.707 --> 53:22.149
Damn it!

53:35.260 --> 53:37.452
Police!  Police!
Don't you move!

53:47.815 --> 53:49.609
Jesus Christ!

55:33.224 --> 55:35.480
I know all it's ass...
