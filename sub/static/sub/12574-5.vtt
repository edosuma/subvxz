00:01.070 --> 00:04.670
Richard Cypher,
you are the true seeker.

00:05.368 --> 00:08.704
( heroic theme playing )

00:21.336 --> 00:23.569
It's holding steady
at north-northeast.

00:23.637 --> 00:26.070
Which should bring us within
a league of Winterhaven by noon.

00:26.137 --> 00:27.904
We could stop there
for a hot meal.

00:27.971 --> 00:30.039
I thought the compass
was supposed to point the way

00:30.107 --> 00:31.940
to the Stone of Tears,
not the nearest tavern.

00:32.008 --> 00:33.107
To reach the Stone of Tears,

00:33.175 --> 00:35.110
we need all the sustenance
we can get.

00:35.178 --> 00:36.811
Zedd.

00:36.879 --> 00:39.716
Look.

00:39.784 --> 00:41.320
Somebody's favorite fruit.

00:41.387 --> 00:47.368
The persimmon is far more
than my favorite fruit.

00:47.435 --> 00:49.203
It's the pinnacle
of creation.

00:49.271 --> 00:51.441
One doesn't often see
such a perfect specimen

00:51.509 --> 00:54.578
this late in the season.

00:54.646 --> 00:57.115
I hope none of you
are expecting a slice

00:57.183 --> 00:59.652
of the last persimmon
of the year.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.221
Wouldn't think of it.

01:01.289 --> 01:03.960
That's very generous of you.

01:05.862 --> 01:10.335
Mm. Mm. Mm.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.904
Any persimmon you can eat

01:11.972 --> 01:14.039
without getting juice
on your chin...

01:14.107 --> 01:17.244
Mm. --isn't worth eating
in the first place.

01:19.348 --> 01:21.117
Can I have a, um...?

01:21.185 --> 01:23.220
A drink of, uh...?
Argh.

01:23.288 --> 01:25.190
(Cara)- Water?
(Zedd)- Yes. Water.

01:25.257 --> 01:27.425
Thank you, Kahlan.
My name is Cara.

01:27.493 --> 01:29.894
I know that.
You called me Kahlan.

01:29.962 --> 01:31.530
I absolutely did not.

01:31.597 --> 01:33.499
Zedd, you did.

01:33.566 --> 01:34.733
I did?

01:34.801 --> 01:36.101
Are you all right?

01:36.169 --> 01:38.204
No, I'm not all right.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.873
It's not indignity enough that
I have more aches in my joints

01:40.941 --> 01:42.275
than joints in my body,

01:42.343 --> 01:44.143
that I stumble to the privy
six times a night.

01:44.211 --> 01:46.012
Now I'm forgetting
the word for water,

01:46.079 --> 01:48.047
and calling people
by the wrong name.

01:48.115 --> 01:49.916
I must be older
than I thought.

01:49.983 --> 01:52.117
You? Old?
Zedd, I'd be lucky

01:52.185 --> 01:54.019
to be half as sharp as you are
when I'm your age.

01:54.087 --> 01:55.821
( sighs )

02:00.494 --> 02:03.531
Where's Tarralyn?

02:03.599 --> 02:05.099
Tarralyn?
Yes, Tarralyn, my daughter.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.234
Where is she?

02:08.270 --> 02:13.274
Zedd, Tarralyn
isn't with us anymore.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.077
She died last summer.

02:15.145 --> 02:19.015
My daughter's dead?

02:19.083 --> 02:20.717
How can that be?

02:25.055 --> 02:27.123
You've known about Tarralyn
for a long time.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.557
This is not like you.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.593
You have the best memory
of anybody I've ever met.

02:31.661 --> 02:33.362
Zedd, something
is happening to you.

02:33.429 --> 02:35.497
Happening. Yes.

02:35.565 --> 02:36.865
Something's happening.

02:36.933 --> 02:38.234
The persimmon.

02:38.302 --> 02:39.902
Zedd's the only one who ate it.

02:39.970 --> 02:41.371
Maybe it was poisoned.

02:41.439 --> 02:44.275
Not poisoned. Spelled.

02:44.343 --> 02:46.877
A spell of f-f-forgetting.

02:46.946 --> 02:48.213
Is there a way to undo it?

02:48.281 --> 02:50.949
Yes.

02:51.017 --> 02:53.285
- A potion.
- A potion of what?

02:54.654 --> 02:58.490
Elderberry blossoms, mandragora,

02:58.558 --> 03:00.026
and the dust
of a Shadrin's horn.

03:00.094 --> 03:01.361
We'll find them.

03:01.428 --> 03:03.162
Zedd, who would have
done this to you?

03:03.230 --> 03:05.431
There's only one person
powerful enough

03:05.499 --> 03:07.300
to spell a Wizard
of the First Order.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.702
Who knows exactly what fruit
I wouldn't be able to resist.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.537
Who?

03:11.605 --> 03:13.973
Zedd, who?

03:14.040 --> 03:15.474
Shota.

03:17.644 --> 03:19.211
Why would Shota
want to do this to you?

03:19.279 --> 03:20.746
Why would who want to do what?

03:20.814 --> 03:22.148
Take away your memory.

03:22.215 --> 03:25.818
- Let go of me.
- Zedd.

03:27.355 --> 03:31.125
Why are you all looking at me
like that? Who are you people?

03:31.193 --> 03:32.727
Find elderberry blossoms.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.429
I'll get the mandragora.

03:34.497 --> 03:36.698
For the Shadrin, we'll have to
go into the caves we passed.

03:36.766 --> 03:39.268
Keep Zedd calm.
Zedd. Zedd, it's all right.

03:39.335 --> 03:41.236
Get away from me!
Don't let him get away.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.006
No!
( Richard grunts )

03:47.844 --> 03:49.645
No!

03:55.753 --> 03:57.621
Richard.

03:57.689 --> 03:59.790
( panting )

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

04:17.377 --> 04:19.812
(Kahlan)
Richard, are you all right?

04:19.880 --> 04:21.247
Unh. Where's Zedd?

04:21.315 --> 04:23.516
He ran off.

04:23.584 --> 04:25.551
You and I will go up to the
caves and try to find a Shadrin.

04:25.619 --> 04:27.253
You follow Zedd.

04:27.321 --> 04:28.888
He can't use his magic
against you.

04:28.956 --> 04:30.289
When you find him,
bring him back here.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.658
He's a very big Wizard.

04:32.726 --> 04:34.627
I may have to do it my way.

04:34.695 --> 04:37.430
Just don't kill him. Go. Unh.

04:37.497 --> 04:39.498
( chickens clucking )

04:42.936 --> 04:45.738
(Man)
Do you think I like having to
come down here personally?

04:45.806 --> 04:47.573
Third week running
we've only gotten

04:47.641 --> 04:50.176
four gold pieces
from you.

04:50.243 --> 04:51.911
Didn't we agree
your fair share

04:51.979 --> 04:54.581
of maintaining the beauty
of our great city was eight?

04:58.219 --> 04:59.619
( man grunting )

04:59.687 --> 05:01.221
Stop that.

05:03.424 --> 05:05.358
You're hurting him.

05:05.426 --> 05:07.727
What are you gonna do
about it, old man?

05:09.396 --> 05:11.063
( chuckles )

05:11.131 --> 05:14.700
( men laughing )
( man grunts )

05:39.660 --> 05:41.060
Excuse me.

05:41.128 --> 05:42.962
Yes?

05:45.232 --> 05:47.266
You're very beautiful.

05:48.736 --> 05:51.237
So I've heard.

05:55.475 --> 05:56.809
( crowd laughing )

06:07.655 --> 06:10.758
Payment upfront.
Payment?

06:10.825 --> 06:13.427
You didn't think you could
partake of my wares for free,

06:13.495 --> 06:16.029
did you?
( giggles )

06:16.097 --> 06:18.264
Coins, old man. Those little
round, shiny things

06:18.332 --> 06:20.233
you keep in that purse
on your belt.

06:20.301 --> 06:22.168
Purse.

06:22.236 --> 06:24.237
Oh, yes.

06:24.305 --> 06:27.574
Coins.

06:27.642 --> 06:29.543
I'm afraid
you'll need ten of those.

06:29.610 --> 06:31.244
The price has gone up.

06:31.312 --> 06:34.081
Now that half of every farthing
I earn goes to Drago.

06:35.416 --> 06:38.284
I wish I had ten.

06:38.352 --> 06:40.687
( magic chimes )

06:42.890 --> 06:44.758
Do that again.

06:46.127 --> 06:48.027
I'll try.

06:50.130 --> 06:51.831
( magic chimes )

06:53.234 --> 06:55.768
( crowd gasps )

06:58.939 --> 07:01.207
Girls, uh, take this
gentleman upstairs

07:01.275 --> 07:03.643
and see that he has
the best night of his life.

07:03.711 --> 07:05.479
( women giggling )

07:05.547 --> 07:08.082
What about her?

07:08.150 --> 07:09.817
(Inkeeper)
Well, that would be
up to Salindra,

07:09.885 --> 07:11.386
and Salindra's very choosy.

07:11.453 --> 07:13.989
But if you ask her nicely,
she might go upstairs with you.

07:20.530 --> 07:23.065
Salindra.

07:23.132 --> 07:25.367
Will you come upstairs with me?

07:26.703 --> 07:28.170
Sorry.

07:28.237 --> 07:30.472
You remind me too much
of my grandfather.

07:30.540 --> 07:31.739
( both laugh )

07:35.611 --> 07:37.679
Come along, handsome.

07:37.746 --> 07:40.781
Who needs her
when you've got us?

07:40.849 --> 07:42.984
( giggling )
( loud bang )

07:43.051 --> 07:45.019
( crowd gasps )

07:45.087 --> 07:46.687
Why is it that when
I'm hunting down a man,

07:46.755 --> 07:48.122
I never have to look further

07:48.190 --> 07:50.758
than the first brothel
past the city gates?

07:50.826 --> 07:52.560
- Keep away from me.
(Cara)- Sorry.

07:52.628 --> 07:55.863
Your little adventure is over.

07:55.931 --> 07:57.698
I'm taking you back
to Richard and Kahlan.

07:57.766 --> 07:59.566
I'm not going anywhere with you.

07:59.634 --> 08:02.168
I think you'll reconsider.

08:06.439 --> 08:07.773
( bird calling )

08:09.375 --> 08:11.376
(Shota)
Thank the Spirits you're safe.

08:13.679 --> 08:15.781
Who are you?

08:15.848 --> 08:17.082
How did I get here?

08:17.150 --> 08:18.818
I'm Shota.

08:18.885 --> 08:21.254
I brought you here.

08:21.321 --> 08:22.822
I'm your friend.

08:22.890 --> 08:26.293
If you're my friend, then
send me back to where I was.

08:26.361 --> 08:27.561
Oh, I can't.

08:27.629 --> 08:29.096
That woman in red
would have killed you.

08:29.164 --> 08:31.132
I saved your life.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.332
( chuckles )

08:32.400 --> 08:33.702
I'm not gonna hurt you.

08:35.572 --> 08:37.206
I love you.

08:39.241 --> 08:40.876
I don't even know you.

08:40.943 --> 08:44.413
Have the years taken that much
from you, Zeddicus?

08:44.481 --> 08:47.650
Have you forgotten even me?

08:47.717 --> 08:49.084
Zeddicus?

08:49.152 --> 08:52.387
Oh, my love.

08:52.455 --> 08:55.457
You don't know that you are
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander,

08:55.524 --> 08:58.459
the greatest and most powerful
Wizard the world has known

08:58.527 --> 09:00.528
in 3,000 years.

09:00.596 --> 09:02.697
- I am?
- Yes.

09:02.765 --> 09:07.035
There is so much to say, but we
don't have very much time.

09:07.103 --> 09:09.371
The world is in terrible
trouble, and only we can help.

09:09.439 --> 09:11.540
A rift has been torn
in the veil

09:11.608 --> 09:13.509
between the Underworld
and the Land of the Living.

09:13.577 --> 09:17.012
If the Seeker of Truth does not
find the Stone of Tears,

09:17.080 --> 09:19.481
the Keeper will put an end
to all life.

09:19.549 --> 09:22.784
The Seeker of Truth?

09:22.851 --> 09:24.285
Who's that?

09:24.353 --> 09:26.620
A great hero,
one that can only be named

09:26.688 --> 09:28.389
by a Wizard of the First Order,

09:28.456 --> 09:31.792
and you, you are the only
Wizard of the First Order alive.

09:31.860 --> 09:33.894
- The only one?
- Yes.

09:33.962 --> 09:35.896
But as you got older
and began to lose your memories,

09:35.964 --> 09:37.165
you made a mistake.

09:37.232 --> 09:40.602
You named the wrong Seeker.

09:40.670 --> 09:42.204
A Seeker prophesied to fail.

09:42.272 --> 09:44.407
That's terrible.

09:44.475 --> 09:47.510
Yes, but fortunately,
I've found a new one,

09:47.578 --> 09:50.714
a young man of great courage.

09:50.782 --> 09:52.783
And once you name him,

09:52.851 --> 09:54.986
and he is able
to fulfill his quest,

09:55.053 --> 09:57.955
then not only
will the world be saved,

09:58.023 --> 09:59.690
but then you and I will be free
to live together,

09:59.758 --> 10:02.192
as we did long ago, in bliss.

10:02.259 --> 10:05.895
And with our combined powers,
Zeddicus,

10:05.962 --> 10:08.731
we will master the world
and protect it from evil.

10:08.799 --> 10:11.267
But how can I help?

10:11.334 --> 10:13.802
An old man, who doesn't remember
his own name?

10:13.870 --> 10:16.605
Oh...

10:16.673 --> 10:19.609
I can restore
what you have lost.

10:21.045 --> 10:25.382
Your youth and the mastery
of all the spells and magic

10:25.450 --> 10:29.087
that were yours
in that golden time long ago,

10:29.154 --> 10:32.124
back when you were at the height
of your powers.

10:32.191 --> 10:34.493
( inhales )

10:34.561 --> 10:36.328
( suspenseful theme playing )

10:42.101 --> 10:43.468
( exhales )

10:45.772 --> 10:47.172
Come.

10:57.518 --> 11:00.254
You are the great love
of my life, Zeddicus.

11:03.725 --> 11:06.727
I'm not surprised.

11:09.258 --> 11:11.626
The Keeper isn't resting,
and neither can we.

11:11.694 --> 11:14.329
In order to name a new Seeker
and send him off on his quest,

11:14.397 --> 11:16.465
we need two things.

11:16.533 --> 11:19.969
First,
the Sword of Truth.

11:22.573 --> 11:24.340
(Zedd)- I know them.
(Shota)- Yes.

11:24.408 --> 11:26.276
The man you wrongly named
the Seeker,

11:26.344 --> 11:28.611
and the misguided Confessor
who protects him.

11:28.679 --> 11:30.446
They tried to attack me.

11:30.514 --> 11:31.915
Of course they did.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.549
To prevent you from naming
the new Seeker.

11:39.055 --> 11:41.155
Shadrin.

11:41.223 --> 11:43.858
( growling )

11:46.761 --> 11:47.961
( roars )

12:00.677 --> 12:02.645
(Man)
Halt and drop your weapons.

12:04.748 --> 12:08.017
Poaching on the personal reserve
of Drago,

12:08.085 --> 12:10.186
High Lord and Master
of Winterhaven,

12:10.254 --> 12:12.755
is a crime
punishable by death.

12:12.823 --> 12:15.791
We didn't know we were on
anyone's personal reserve.

12:15.859 --> 12:19.295
Lord Drago was a great friend
of Lord Rahl's.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.163
He'll be more than happy to see
the Seeker and the Confessor

12:22.231 --> 12:23.832
hanging from his gallows.

12:23.899 --> 12:26.067
Take them.
But don't let her touch you.

12:26.135 --> 12:28.469
She's deadlier
than a poison dart.

12:28.537 --> 12:31.106
( Richard yells )

12:31.174 --> 12:33.475
( all grunting )

12:38.681 --> 12:40.782
For what I am going to do,

12:40.850 --> 12:42.951
I need to join my magic
with yours.

12:43.019 --> 12:45.086
Give me your hand.

12:48.858 --> 12:51.493
Think, Zeddicus.

12:51.561 --> 12:53.127
You know the words
to the Spell of Taking.

12:53.195 --> 12:55.497
I've restored them to you.

12:55.564 --> 12:56.931
Yes.

12:56.999 --> 12:58.700
Yes, I remember them.

12:58.767 --> 12:59.734
Say them with me.

12:59.802 --> 13:01.002
( grunting )

13:01.070 --> 13:03.337
( chanting in ancient tongue )

13:07.777 --> 13:09.478
( panting )

13:13.883 --> 13:15.084
Astounding.

13:15.151 --> 13:17.553
Not for us, Zeddicus.

13:17.621 --> 13:19.455
For us, it's barely more
than a parlor trick.

13:21.459 --> 13:23.627
( all grunting )

13:26.798 --> 13:28.032
Richard!

13:31.169 --> 13:34.738
The new Seeker needs one more
thing to complete his quest.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.642
Stop! Unh!

13:38.709 --> 13:40.877
( Richard grunting )

13:42.713 --> 13:45.048
What's this?

13:45.115 --> 13:46.282
Witchcraft.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.418
( all grunting )

14:10.911 --> 14:13.679
( grunts )

14:13.746 --> 14:16.114
( panting )

14:17.549 --> 14:19.483
- What is it?
- A compass.

14:19.551 --> 14:22.286
In the hands of the Seeker named
by a Wizard of the First Order,

14:22.353 --> 14:24.688
it will illuminate and light
the way to the Stone of Tears

14:24.755 --> 14:27.157
and the salvation of the world.

14:27.224 --> 14:28.958
But the province where we will
find the new Seeker

14:29.025 --> 14:30.392
is many leagues from here.

14:30.460 --> 14:31.860
We must leave immediately.

14:31.928 --> 14:34.764
- Leave?
- Yes.

14:34.831 --> 14:38.867
- Right now.
- I don't want to leave.

14:38.935 --> 14:40.903
I like it here.

14:40.971 --> 14:43.338
Is it Winterhaven that you like,

14:43.406 --> 14:46.175
or one of the harlots?

14:46.243 --> 14:48.478
I should have known that by
giving you a beautiful face

14:48.546 --> 14:50.113
it wouldn't make you
any less of an old fool.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.683
Fool, am I?

14:52.750 --> 14:56.053
Many thanks for the beautiful
young face.

14:56.121 --> 14:58.089
And the wonderful spells.

14:58.157 --> 14:59.824
But I'm not going anywhere
with you.

14:59.892 --> 15:00.892
( chants in ancient tongue )

15:05.398 --> 15:08.166
( chants in ancient tongue )

15:09.669 --> 15:10.635
( sighs )

15:10.703 --> 15:11.703
( crowd chattering )

15:11.771 --> 15:14.339
(Zedd)
Hello, Salindra.

15:14.407 --> 15:15.974
Do I know you?

15:16.042 --> 15:20.179
Well, I guess I don't look like
your grandfather anymore.

15:21.881 --> 15:25.016
Oh. It's you.

15:25.084 --> 15:28.119
Well, you certainly have a lot
of tricks up your sleeve. Heh.

15:28.187 --> 15:31.055
What are you wasting your time
on a mouse like this for?

15:31.123 --> 15:33.858
Oh, he is hardly a mouse.

15:42.935 --> 15:44.936
Are you trying to impress me?

15:47.206 --> 15:48.439
What is it?

15:48.507 --> 15:51.508
Why are you looking at me
that way?

15:52.911 --> 15:55.612
When I first saw you,

15:55.680 --> 15:57.982
I thought you might be
the princess

15:58.050 --> 16:00.285
I was looking for.

16:00.352 --> 16:03.621
But I don't know,
dressed like that.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.395
( crowd gasps )

16:10.463 --> 16:13.164
(Zedd)
And what
self-respecting princess

16:13.232 --> 16:15.566
goes around without a footman...

16:16.468 --> 16:17.802
( crowd gasps )

16:17.870 --> 16:19.704
(Zedd)
...and ladies in waiting?

16:21.407 --> 16:22.974
( crowd gasps )

16:29.481 --> 16:32.282
Well, the real question is,

16:32.350 --> 16:35.119
what kind of princess

16:35.186 --> 16:37.788
goes around without a prince?

16:44.610 --> 16:46.010
<i>( majestic theme playing )</i>

16:48.747 --> 16:50.280
Do you like the view?

16:52.383 --> 16:54.151
(Salindra)
Very much.

16:54.218 --> 16:56.753
Then allow me to welcome you
to your new palace.

16:56.821 --> 16:58.788
I don't see a palace.

16:58.856 --> 17:00.523
Not yet.

17:05.561 --> 17:07.128
Girls?

17:07.196 --> 17:08.364
Mm. Half a dozen of them.

17:08.431 --> 17:09.665
Hanging all over him.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.800
And then he disappeared.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.767
I've been searching for him
all night.

17:13.835 --> 17:15.068
Look.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.971
I guess we know
where Zedd is.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.307
Let's go.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.344
Does this meet
with Your Majesty's approval?

17:26.412 --> 17:28.046
I think it will do.

17:36.888 --> 17:40.123
Once we get there, how do we get
Zedd to drink the potion?

17:40.190 --> 17:42.424
(Shota)
You won't be able
to get near him.

17:42.492 --> 17:45.760
Shota.

17:45.828 --> 17:47.929
He thinks you're his enemies.
He'll obliterate you.

17:47.996 --> 17:51.030
I don't know
what you did to him, or why,

17:51.098 --> 17:53.366
but I'm gonna stop him before
he hurts somebody or himself.

17:53.434 --> 17:57.103
Oh, just because you have
flowers and roots

17:57.171 --> 17:58.338
and a Shadrin's horn,

17:58.406 --> 18:00.373
that doesn't mean
you can reverse my spell.

18:00.441 --> 18:02.175
No, what I have done,
only I can undo.

18:02.243 --> 18:03.410
Then do it.

18:03.478 --> 18:06.880
Oh, heh, I will.

18:06.947 --> 18:09.517
After he has named a new Seeker.

18:09.584 --> 18:11.318
What?

18:11.386 --> 18:13.387
( laughs ):
Oh.

18:13.455 --> 18:15.724
He hasn't told you about
the Prophecy.

18:15.791 --> 18:17.792
What Prophecy?

18:17.860 --> 18:19.694
A month ago I told him
that it was written

18:19.762 --> 18:22.530
in the Halls of Prophecy
that Richard Cypher will fail

18:22.598 --> 18:24.598
in his quest to defeat
the Keeper.

18:24.666 --> 18:26.833
Fail how? What do you mean?

18:26.901 --> 18:28.935
I don't care about Prophecy,

18:29.003 --> 18:31.604
and I don't have time
for your riddles and tricks.

18:31.672 --> 18:34.773
None of my prophecies
have ever proved false.

18:34.841 --> 18:36.775
I begged Zedd
to name a new Seeker,

18:36.843 --> 18:39.979
but he was too blinded
by his sentimental attachment

18:40.046 --> 18:41.247
to his grandson.

18:41.314 --> 18:43.849
I hoped that if I stripped him
of his memories,

18:43.917 --> 18:45.851
I might convince him to do
what had to be done.

18:45.919 --> 18:47.486
Richard is the Seeker.

18:47.554 --> 18:50.657
Of course you'd say that
about the man who you love.

18:50.724 --> 18:53.527
But I didn't come here
expecting your help.

18:55.697 --> 18:57.565
I came hoping for yours.

19:01.503 --> 19:02.870
Why would I help you?

19:02.938 --> 19:05.807
Because you don't care
who bears the name of Seeker,

19:05.874 --> 19:07.842
you only care about
protecting Richard Rahl.

19:07.910 --> 19:10.344
But if he continues
on this doomed quest,

19:10.412 --> 19:12.180
the Keeper will win,
and he will die

19:12.247 --> 19:15.416
along with everyone else
in the world.

19:15.484 --> 19:17.217
Now, Zedd can't use his magic
against you.

19:17.285 --> 19:19.386
If you subdue him,

19:19.453 --> 19:21.121
then I can force him to do
what must be done.

19:22.657 --> 19:25.925
Funny, how people always curse
the Mord-Sith,

19:25.993 --> 19:27.827
until they need one.

19:27.894 --> 19:30.930
Do you want Richard to live
or don't you?

19:30.998 --> 19:34.033
You're right.

19:34.101 --> 19:38.003
Wizards can't use their magic
against a Mord-Sith.

19:38.071 --> 19:40.439
And neither can witches.

19:40.506 --> 19:42.941
( screaming )
( Agiel whining )

19:43.008 --> 19:45.243
There's only one way to
stop that from happening again:

19:45.311 --> 19:47.545
Undo the spell you put on Zedd.

19:50.182 --> 19:52.116
(Man)
No matter how much we give them,
Great Wizard,

19:52.183 --> 19:53.817
Drago always wants more.

19:53.885 --> 19:55.352
(Zedd)
I swear to you, sir,

19:55.420 --> 19:58.323
and to all citizens
of Winterhaven,

19:58.390 --> 20:01.295
such cruelty will never again
be tolerated in this city.

20:03.565 --> 20:06.834
They've destroyed all my wares,
my children will go hungry.

20:06.902 --> 20:09.703
If there's something
you can do to help...

20:11.939 --> 20:14.875
( laughing )

20:14.943 --> 20:17.344
Ha-ha! Thank you, thank you,
Great Wizard.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.314
(Zedd)
Monica.

20:20.381 --> 20:22.148
Will you accept this trifle,

20:22.216 --> 20:23.650
in thanks for befriending me

20:23.718 --> 20:26.720
when I was a ragged old man
with no castle to my name?

20:26.787 --> 20:28.855
(Monica)
It's very beautiful,
Great Wizard.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.490
But there's trouble
in Winterhaven

20:30.558 --> 20:32.925
that all the jewels
of Athanasia can't fix.

20:32.993 --> 20:37.096
The dead coming back to life,
murdering people in their homes.

20:37.163 --> 20:38.797
The Keeper's work,
people say.

20:38.865 --> 20:42.635
Same for the cracks in the
ground, opening up all over.

20:42.703 --> 20:46.040
A tear in the veil
between the Underworld

20:46.107 --> 20:48.209
and the Land of the Living.

20:48.277 --> 20:50.111
There's a rift just outside
the walls of the city.

20:50.179 --> 20:51.846
A monster crawled
out of it last week,

20:51.914 --> 20:53.648
slaughtered two
of my best customers,

20:53.716 --> 20:54.982
on their way back
to their village.

20:55.050 --> 20:58.420
You have to help us.

20:59.889 --> 21:03.725
To help you seal the rift,
and defeat the Keeper,

21:03.793 --> 21:05.661
we need to find
the Stone of Tears.

21:05.728 --> 21:09.063
And to find the Stone of Tears,
we need a Seeker.

21:09.131 --> 21:11.599
Yes. Richard Cypher.

21:11.667 --> 21:15.204
Hm, I'm afraid we can't rely
on Richard Cypher.

21:15.272 --> 21:17.506
There's a Prophecy that says
he's destined to fail.

21:17.574 --> 21:21.544
Don't worry,
we'll have a new Seeker.

21:21.612 --> 21:25.047
Only a Wizard of the First Order
can name one,

21:25.115 --> 21:27.917
and fortunately,
I am such a Wizard.

21:27.984 --> 21:29.218
Who will you name?

21:32.222 --> 21:35.625
As Wizard of the First Order,

21:35.692 --> 21:39.829
I hereby name as Seeker of Truth

21:39.897 --> 21:43.833
and Bearer of the Sword...

21:45.035 --> 21:48.337
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander!

21:48.405 --> 21:50.473
( all cheer )

21:54.557 --> 21:56.591
( dramatic theme playing )

21:56.659 --> 21:58.360
Yes.

21:58.428 --> 22:01.296
The compass points
the Seeker's way.

22:01.364 --> 22:03.932
My princess and I
will depart at once

22:03.999 --> 22:05.733
on the quest
for the Stone of Tears.

22:05.801 --> 22:08.636
( all cheer )

22:08.704 --> 22:09.804
Secure horses
and provisions

22:09.872 --> 22:11.739
for all those who wish
to accompany us.

22:11.807 --> 22:13.974
Yes, My Lord.

22:14.042 --> 22:17.278
What sorcerer dares to raise
a castle in my city?

22:18.613 --> 22:21.014
I'm no sorcerer.

22:21.082 --> 22:24.251
I am Zeddicus,
greatest of all Wizards,

22:24.318 --> 22:26.153
Seeker of Truth,

22:26.220 --> 22:29.489
and high lord
and master of Winterhaven.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.224
This man will die.

22:31.292 --> 22:32.493
And let it be known

22:32.560 --> 22:34.595
that any friend of his
is an enemy of mine.

22:34.662 --> 22:36.730
( giggles )

22:36.798 --> 22:38.332
Oh, Drago,

22:38.400 --> 22:40.601
you always were
a man who overestimated

22:40.669 --> 22:42.202
what he had in his quiver.

22:42.270 --> 22:45.773
I'm afraid this time you've
met more than your match.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.476
Kill her first.

22:48.544 --> 22:50.211
( screams )

22:56.285 --> 22:57.451
The choice is yours.

22:57.519 --> 22:59.420
You can join me on my quest,

22:59.488 --> 23:01.255
or you can suffer the same fate.

23:01.322 --> 23:03.657
Which is it going to be?

23:09.363 --> 23:10.997
A wise choice.

23:11.064 --> 23:12.965
( all cheering )

23:13.032 --> 23:15.200
( chuckles )

23:18.403 --> 23:20.237
( men screaming )

23:25.477 --> 23:26.643
Drago.

23:26.711 --> 23:28.512
My Lord.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.351
You're alive?

23:33.418 --> 23:35.386
No.

23:35.454 --> 23:36.554
And neither are you.

23:38.890 --> 23:40.024
Then this place--

23:40.092 --> 23:40.858
(Rahl)
The Underworld.

23:42.227 --> 23:44.194
You served me well
in life, Drago.

23:44.262 --> 23:46.096
I did my best, Lord Rahl.

23:46.164 --> 23:50.968
And I will reward you with
an offer from the Keeper:

23:51.035 --> 23:53.570
Kill and live.

23:53.638 --> 23:55.371
My Lord?

23:55.439 --> 23:58.074
One more day of life

23:58.142 --> 24:00.843
for every soul
you deliver to the Keeper.

24:00.911 --> 24:04.114
I gratefully accept,
Lord Rahl.

24:04.182 --> 24:06.383
And I will begin
by ripping out the heart

24:06.451 --> 24:08.853
of Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander
and feeding it to my dogs.

24:08.921 --> 24:11.990
Zorander the Wizard?

24:12.058 --> 24:15.494
Yes, Wizard,
and now Seeker of Truth.

24:15.562 --> 24:16.696
Seeker of Truth?

24:16.764 --> 24:18.498
Yes, My Lord.

24:18.565 --> 24:19.832
He named himself.

24:19.900 --> 24:23.069
The former Seeker,
and the Mother Confessor,

24:23.137 --> 24:24.938
are they with him?
Not that I saw.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.807
But when I send
the Wizard to the Keeper,

24:26.874 --> 24:28.609
you can ask him yourself.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.510
Unfortunately,
a Wizard of the First Order

24:30.578 --> 24:32.912
is not so easy to kill,

24:32.980 --> 24:34.747
as you yourself discovered.

24:36.283 --> 24:41.020
But don't worry,
your death will be avenged.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.855
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

24:48.296 --> 24:50.230
( trumpet plays fanfare )

24:52.501 --> 24:55.203
( rift rumbling )

24:55.271 --> 24:56.872
Halt!

24:56.939 --> 24:59.174
( rumbling continues )

25:12.821 --> 25:14.989
So this is a rift

25:15.056 --> 25:17.290
between the Underworld
and the land of the living?

25:17.358 --> 25:19.359
Yes, Wizard.

25:19.427 --> 25:20.827
One of many,
all over the countryside.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.897
(Zedd)
Do you hear me, Keeper?

25:23.965 --> 25:26.066
Your plans will come to nothing,

25:26.134 --> 25:27.935
for I, Zeddicus,

25:28.003 --> 25:29.704
greatest of all Wizards,

25:29.771 --> 25:33.475
high lord and master
of Winterhaven,

25:33.543 --> 25:37.546
Seeker of the Truth,
and Sealer of the Rift,

25:37.614 --> 25:41.150
will lock you in your
prison for all eternity.

25:41.217 --> 25:43.485
( gasps )

25:43.553 --> 25:45.321
( suspenseful theme playing )

25:45.388 --> 25:48.090
( crowd gasps )

25:48.158 --> 25:51.226
( chatter )

25:56.698 --> 25:57.632
( grunts )

26:01.970 --> 26:03.872
She's dead.

26:03.939 --> 26:07.075
My love,
I will bring you back.

26:09.778 --> 26:12.414
( chants in ancient tongue )

26:16.553 --> 26:19.155
( gasps )

26:19.223 --> 26:21.524
(Rahl)
Salindra.

26:21.592 --> 26:24.327
Salindra.

26:24.394 --> 26:25.962
(Salindra)
Lord Rahl.

26:26.029 --> 26:28.331
( gasps )

26:28.399 --> 26:30.099
(Rahl)
Don't be frightened.

26:30.167 --> 26:33.135
It's much too late for fear
to do you any good.

26:33.203 --> 26:35.738
What are you
going to do to me?

26:35.806 --> 26:37.506
That would be up to you.

26:37.574 --> 26:40.042
If you like,
I could give you a second life.

26:41.812 --> 26:42.912
At what price?

26:42.980 --> 26:45.281
Only small one.

26:45.349 --> 26:48.217
Simply deliver the Wizard
to the Underworld,

26:48.285 --> 26:50.186
along with the Sword of Truth
and the compass.

26:50.253 --> 26:52.255
What do you need them for?

26:52.323 --> 26:53.490
Haven't you heard?

26:53.558 --> 26:56.260
The Keeper is fighting a war

26:56.327 --> 26:57.661
to conquer
the World of the Living

26:57.729 --> 27:00.364
and he needs your help.

27:00.432 --> 27:02.399
Can he count on you?

27:05.037 --> 27:07.406
Isn't there some
other price I could pay?

27:09.175 --> 27:12.010
Don't tell me you've
fallen in love with him.

27:13.246 --> 27:15.781
He's a nice fellow.

27:15.849 --> 27:17.383
He's been kind to me.

27:17.450 --> 27:19.952
They're all nice fellows to you,

27:20.019 --> 27:23.522
as long as they have
a little gold in their pocket.

27:23.589 --> 27:24.890
On the other hand,

27:24.957 --> 27:26.958
you're welcome to stay here
with us in the Underworld.

27:27.026 --> 27:31.396
The Keeper maintains a very
special chamber of torments

27:31.464 --> 27:33.632
for those
who traffic in love.

27:33.699 --> 27:38.303
Ask yourself,
what is the life of one Wizard?

27:38.370 --> 27:41.006
Come, Salindra.

27:41.073 --> 27:43.943
You're a practical girl.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.811
( dramatic theme playing )

27:49.831 --> 27:52.232
( chants in ancient tongue )

27:56.003 --> 27:59.672
She's getting cold.
She's not coming back.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.808
(Man)
There are some things
nobody can do.

28:01.875 --> 28:04.377
- Not even you, Great Wizard.
- No.

28:04.445 --> 28:07.413
There's nothing I can't do.

28:07.481 --> 28:11.017
( chanting in ancient tongue )

28:14.088 --> 28:15.556
( screams )

28:15.623 --> 28:17.558
( gasps )

28:20.995 --> 28:23.564
My beauty.
I've brought you back.

28:23.632 --> 28:26.267
Zeddicus.

28:26.334 --> 28:28.402
What am I doing here?
I said no.

28:28.470 --> 28:29.870
What do you mean?

28:29.938 --> 28:32.239
Oh, Darken Rahl told me
I could come back to life

28:32.307 --> 28:36.377
if I turned against you,
but I refused.

28:36.444 --> 28:38.011
( panting )

28:38.079 --> 28:40.647
He was about to throw me
in the pit.

28:40.715 --> 28:44.051
You can't imagine
how horrible it was...

28:44.118 --> 28:47.087
And then suddenly
I was looking up at you.

28:48.456 --> 28:50.556
You brought me back.

28:50.624 --> 28:53.627
Yes.

28:53.694 --> 28:55.495
And I'll never
let you go again.

28:58.766 --> 29:03.503
Behold, I am Zeddicus,
greatest of all Wizards,

29:03.570 --> 29:06.238
high lord and master
of Winterhaven,

29:06.306 --> 29:08.874
Sealer of the Rift,
Seeker of Truth,

29:08.942 --> 29:12.577
Defeater of Death
and Restorer of Life!

29:12.645 --> 29:13.778
( all cheering )

29:15.714 --> 29:17.415
That's Zedd?

29:19.051 --> 29:20.151
Yes, that's Zedd.

29:20.219 --> 29:22.020
He's named himself the Seeker?

29:22.087 --> 29:23.789
This is a catastrophe.

29:23.856 --> 29:26.691
When I have found
the Stone of Tears,

29:26.758 --> 29:29.627
I will banish death
from this world.

29:29.694 --> 29:31.061
Undo the spell.

29:31.129 --> 29:33.263
No. It's too dangerous.

29:33.331 --> 29:35.031
His magic's too powerful.

29:35.099 --> 29:37.234
I'm not going out there
until you subdue him.

29:37.301 --> 29:39.904
And leave you here?
To do whatever it is

29:39.971 --> 29:41.372
you please
with Richard and Kahlan

29:41.439 --> 29:42.940
the second
my back is turned?

29:43.008 --> 29:44.642
( chuckles )

29:44.709 --> 29:46.110
I don't think so.

29:46.178 --> 29:47.946
Then we have a problem.

29:48.013 --> 29:49.414
If you don't start moving,

29:49.481 --> 29:51.216
you're going to have
a bigger problem.

29:51.284 --> 29:53.085
No. We need to do this without

29:53.153 --> 29:56.555
putting anybody in danger.
How?

29:56.623 --> 29:58.557
When Shota took
away his memories,

29:58.625 --> 30:00.325
he lost everything
he's learned in life:

30:00.393 --> 30:04.696
wisdom, judgment,
knowing about consequences.

30:04.764 --> 30:07.032
Don't forget about humility.

30:07.099 --> 30:09.000
Of which he had precious
little to start with.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.636
He thinks he's more powerful
than the Keeper.

30:11.704 --> 30:13.237
He's turned himself
into a king.

30:13.305 --> 30:14.972
He's even
found himself a queen.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.474
If he sees us all coming,

30:16.541 --> 30:18.810
he'll think we're trying to take
everything away from him.

30:18.877 --> 30:20.244
Shota's right,
he could obliterate us.

30:20.312 --> 30:21.546
So, what do we do?

30:21.613 --> 30:23.681
With his powers,
he could actually succeed

30:23.749 --> 30:26.518
in finding the Stone.

30:26.586 --> 30:29.288
But he's not the true Seeker.
You are.

30:29.355 --> 30:32.391
I doesn't matter
who has the title,

30:32.459 --> 30:34.227
or who gets the glory,

30:34.295 --> 30:36.196
as long as the Stone is found
and the rift is sealed.

30:36.263 --> 30:38.599
(Kahlan)
He's lost his mind.

30:38.666 --> 30:40.366
There's no way
we can count on him.

30:42.068 --> 30:44.803
You're right.

30:44.871 --> 30:46.439
( sighs )

30:46.506 --> 30:48.106
But we don't want to make
him feel threatened.

30:48.174 --> 30:49.407
Not now.

30:49.475 --> 30:51.142
Whatever he's forgotten,
he's still Zedd.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.544
If I can
get close to him,

30:53.612 --> 30:56.714
talk to him,
gain his confidence,

30:56.781 --> 30:59.683
maybe I could make him
see what he's doing,

30:59.751 --> 31:03.020
and what the cost could be.

31:03.087 --> 31:05.489
I'm so frightened for you.

31:05.557 --> 31:07.190
About what?

31:09.660 --> 31:11.762
Do you promise you won't
do anything crazy and reckless?

31:11.829 --> 31:14.798
Salindra, tell me.

31:18.903 --> 31:22.005
When I was in the Underworld,

31:22.073 --> 31:26.343
in that awful,
terrible place,

31:26.410 --> 31:28.478
I heard Darken Rahl
talking to the Keeper.

31:28.546 --> 31:31.615
They're happy you've
taken up the Seeker's quest.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.716
They think that while you're

31:33.784 --> 31:36.586
chasing after
the Stone of Tears,

31:36.654 --> 31:38.187
they will have time
to destroy us all.

31:40.424 --> 31:43.560
But there's one thing
they're terrified of.

31:43.627 --> 31:45.528
What?

31:45.596 --> 31:48.999
They're terrified that you
are going to march into the rift

31:49.066 --> 31:52.702
and battle the Keeper
with the Sword of Truth,

31:52.770 --> 31:54.170
because they know
you would win.

31:56.641 --> 32:00.377
Oh, Zeddicus, I'm so afraid you
will try something like that.

32:00.444 --> 32:03.413
(Man)
Sir, this man wanted to see you.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.881
He said it was
extremely important.

32:04.948 --> 32:07.517
We've searched him head to foot,
he isn't armed.

32:07.584 --> 32:09.051
I know him.

32:09.119 --> 32:10.353
You remember me?

32:10.420 --> 32:14.356
Yes,
you're the false Seeker.

32:14.424 --> 32:16.692
You and your friends
tried to attack me

32:16.759 --> 32:18.193
when I was still
an old man.

32:18.261 --> 32:21.997
We weren't trying to attack you,
we were worried about you.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.866
Do you remember anything
before yesterday?

32:23.934 --> 32:26.970
No. Heh.

32:27.037 --> 32:28.505
But why would I need to?

32:28.572 --> 32:32.108
Nothing of any importance
happened to me before yesterday.

32:32.176 --> 32:33.576
Something terrible did happen.

32:33.644 --> 32:35.445
While you and I were walking
through the forest,

32:35.512 --> 32:37.480
you ate a persimmon
that was spelled by a witch,

32:37.548 --> 32:39.649
and you suddenly
lost your memory.

32:39.717 --> 32:42.386
You were scared and confused.

32:42.453 --> 32:44.755
We tried to calm you down,
but you ran away.

32:44.822 --> 32:46.556
Who are you exactly?

32:49.861 --> 32:51.094
I'm your grandson.

32:53.197 --> 32:55.265
- Grandson?
- Yes.

32:55.333 --> 32:57.334
And a man never
had a better grandfather.

32:59.871 --> 33:02.840
You risked your life
for me hundreds of times.

33:02.907 --> 33:06.210
Without you, the most evil
despot who ever lived

33:06.277 --> 33:07.477
would still be on his throne.

33:08.947 --> 33:12.182
- Would he?
- Yes.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.985
You saved the world.
Many times.

33:15.053 --> 33:19.290
Mm. Well, grandson,

33:19.357 --> 33:20.791
I look forward
to knowing you better,

33:20.859 --> 33:23.360
but right now,
I have a pressing engagement

33:23.428 --> 33:24.695
with the Keeper.

33:24.763 --> 33:25.963
Zeddicus. No.

33:26.031 --> 33:27.565
Yes, Salindra.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.835
I'm marching into the rift alone
to do battle with the Keeper.

33:29.902 --> 33:31.436
You can't go into the rift.

33:31.504 --> 33:34.039
Ah, but I can.
Zedd, no--

33:34.107 --> 33:35.908
Don't worry, you won't
lose your grandfather.

33:35.976 --> 33:40.179
I'll come back, with the blood
of Death himself on my sword.

33:40.246 --> 33:42.147
No one goes into the Underworld
and comes out alive.

33:42.215 --> 33:43.749
Nobody except me.
You'll be killed!

33:43.816 --> 33:45.717
And the Keeper will have
the Sword of Truth,

33:45.785 --> 33:47.051
and the compass.

33:47.119 --> 33:48.753
The Keeper fears me.

33:48.821 --> 33:50.621
What makes you think that?

33:50.689 --> 33:53.257
I was told by somebody
who heard it with her own ears.

33:57.729 --> 33:58.963
She's lying to you.

33:59.030 --> 34:01.899
She's trying to lead you
into some kind of trap.

34:01.967 --> 34:04.903
She wouldn't trick me.
She wouldn't lie to me.

34:04.970 --> 34:07.406
She loves me. Stay back.

34:07.474 --> 34:09.074
Zedd, no!

34:09.141 --> 34:11.143
( grunts )

34:11.210 --> 34:13.478
( suspenseful theme playing )

34:13.547 --> 34:15.614
(woman)
Look out!
The Confessor is coming.

34:15.683 --> 34:17.583
(Man)
Get her!

34:19.454 --> 34:20.487
( grunting )

34:32.199 --> 34:33.733
This isn't farewell.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.400
Just a brief parting.

34:35.469 --> 34:38.170
May the Spirits be with you,
Zeddicus.

34:39.606 --> 34:41.005
They always are.

35:00.929 --> 35:02.497
( grunting )

35:15.176 --> 35:17.345
Get him out.

35:21.850 --> 35:24.685
( chants in ancient tongue )

35:24.753 --> 35:27.388
( grunts )

35:27.455 --> 35:30.724
He went into the rift!
(Kahlan) No.

35:57.391 --> 36:00.392
( gas hissing )

36:00.426 --> 36:01.926
I'm going after him.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.127
Richard, no!

36:03.162 --> 36:04.962
I can't abandon Zedd.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.764
Then I'm coming with you.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.300
If Zedd and I don't come back,

36:09.334 --> 36:11.236
someone needs to stay alive
to find the Stone.

36:13.807 --> 36:17.109
Kahlan, the quest is bigger
than any of us.

36:17.143 --> 36:18.644
Don't follow me.

36:29.489 --> 36:31.390
( dramatic theme playing )

36:35.034 --> 36:37.535
( suspenseful theme playing )

36:37.569 --> 36:40.370
Zedd!

36:40.404 --> 36:43.639
Don't go any farther!

36:43.673 --> 36:45.707
Zedd!

36:51.314 --> 36:53.081
Zedd!

37:04.159 --> 37:06.860
( groans )
(Richard)- No, Zedd!

37:08.262 --> 37:10.297
(Rahl)
Youth is fleeting,

37:10.331 --> 37:12.498
isn't it, Zeddicus?

37:12.532 --> 37:14.733
(Richard)
Zedd, get away from him.

37:17.370 --> 37:18.903
Zedd!

37:21.340 --> 37:24.142
For all of us, it would seem.

37:24.176 --> 37:26.777
Including the Seeker.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.379
Zedd, we have to go.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.413
A valiant effort,
dear brother,

37:30.448 --> 37:32.548
but the Keeper
has granted me

37:32.582 --> 37:35.851
power over the gates
of his dominion.

37:35.885 --> 37:37.919
( rumbling )

37:54.333 --> 37:54.399
Richard!

38:09.311 --> 38:11.312
( heroic theme playing )

38:13.915 --> 38:16.149
Richard.

38:16.184 --> 38:18.184
Zedd.

38:18.219 --> 38:21.419
(Zedd)
I failed.

38:21.454 --> 38:23.254
( Salindra grunts )

38:25.891 --> 38:28.259
( gasping )

38:30.061 --> 38:31.728
Don't worry, my beauty.

38:31.762 --> 38:35.298
Whatever's wrong,
I'll heal you.

38:36.799 --> 38:39.634
You can't.

38:39.668 --> 38:43.371
I didn't deliver my side
of the bargain.

38:43.405 --> 38:46.473
The Keeper's calling
in the debt.

38:46.507 --> 38:47.908
Debt?

38:47.942 --> 38:50.110
I tricked you.

38:50.144 --> 38:51.744
Why?

38:51.778 --> 38:54.380
I-- I--

38:54.414 --> 38:57.582
I'm a practical girl.

38:57.616 --> 38:58.749
( gasps )

38:58.784 --> 39:01.785
( whimpers )

39:01.820 --> 39:04.621
( gasps )

39:04.655 --> 39:07.456
( sobbing )

39:07.491 --> 39:09.925
( melancholic theme playing )

39:16.130 --> 39:20.733
Break the spell.

39:20.767 --> 39:23.836
Now.

39:23.870 --> 39:27.808
( chanting in ancient tongue )

39:29.177 --> 39:30.812
( dramatic theme playing )

39:45.196 --> 39:46.496
(Zedd)
Richard. Kahlan.

39:46.530 --> 39:49.165
What in the name of creation
have I done?

39:49.199 --> 39:53.434
Whatever you did,
it's not your fault,

39:53.469 --> 39:55.837
it's Shota's.
(Shota) No.

39:55.871 --> 39:58.338
I was trying to save everyone.

39:58.373 --> 39:59.706
And I might have succeeded,

39:59.740 --> 40:02.939
if I hadn't underestimated
your pride and arrogance.

40:02.973 --> 40:06.442
Which are exceeded
only by your own.

40:06.476 --> 40:08.844
(Cara)
She's of no use to us now.

40:08.878 --> 40:11.445
Should I kill her?

40:11.480 --> 40:12.780
(Richard)
No.

40:12.814 --> 40:14.682
We may need her someday.

40:18.686 --> 40:20.853
Apparently, you've gainedwisdom.

40:23.590 --> 40:28.359
When you're ready to name
a new Seeker, call on me.

40:28.394 --> 40:32.229
Meanwhile,
enjoy the one you've got.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.201
(Kahlan)
Zedd...

40:40.038 --> 40:41.873
...can you do anything?

40:47.113 --> 40:49.179
( chants in ancient tongue )

40:58.388 --> 41:00.656
( sighs )

41:05.330 --> 41:06.630
Something on your mind?

41:06.664 --> 41:08.499
There's plenty on my mind.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.067
Starting with
"I wonder if Zedd

41:10.102 --> 41:11.503
"didn't tell me
about the Prophecy

41:11.537 --> 41:13.806
because he believes
it to be true."

41:13.840 --> 41:15.307
Is that a new power
of yours?

41:15.342 --> 41:17.176
Being able to read
people's thoughts?

41:17.210 --> 41:18.677
I didn't tell you not because

41:18.712 --> 41:21.412
I had doubts about
your ability to succeed,

41:21.447 --> 41:22.580
but because I didn't want you

41:22.614 --> 41:25.249
to start having doubts
of your own.

41:25.283 --> 41:27.184
What if Shota's right?

41:27.218 --> 41:28.851
About some young swain of hers

41:28.885 --> 41:30.686
she wants me to anoint
so she can wield

41:30.721 --> 41:33.456
the Sword of the Truth
herself by proxy?

41:33.490 --> 41:36.525
Shota thinks only of Shota.

41:36.559 --> 41:38.960
If any proof were ever needed

41:38.995 --> 41:40.829
that not just anybody
can be the Seeker,

41:40.863 --> 41:42.197
my own behavior today
provided it.

41:42.231 --> 41:44.199
Will you have
to name me again?

41:44.233 --> 41:46.234
No.

41:46.268 --> 41:47.535
You were always the Seeker,

41:47.569 --> 41:50.404
long before you first
held the Sword of Truth.

41:53.808 --> 41:56.810
You faced death for me.
Literally.

41:58.412 --> 42:01.480
What was it like,
being young again?

42:01.514 --> 42:04.149
Oh, Richard,

42:04.184 --> 42:08.253
it's years beyond count
since I felt that way.

42:08.288 --> 42:10.555
That there was no mountain
I couldn't climb,

42:10.590 --> 42:13.091
no woman I couldn't win.
( chuckles )

42:13.125 --> 42:15.526
You made me young again.

42:15.560 --> 42:16.894
Could you do that
to yourself?

42:16.928 --> 42:18.429
Yes.

42:18.463 --> 42:20.131
Then why don't you?

42:20.165 --> 42:23.000
Because one journey down
the agonizing gauntlet

42:23.034 --> 42:24.901
of youth
is enough for any man.

42:27.438 --> 42:28.805
She was very beautiful.

42:28.839 --> 42:32.575
Yes, she was, wasn't she?

42:32.609 --> 42:33.610
( soft theme playing )
