01:08.401 --> 01:11.279
That's our target, the moon of Tragoch.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.198
According to our latest intelligence,

01:13.281 --> 01:16.034
that's where the Galra are building
their upgraded sentries.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.620
Taking out this base will mean
the Galra won't be able

01:18.703 --> 01:20.830
to resupply their bases and ships
for months.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.832
How do we know this isn't a trap?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.751
All the intel's checked out so far.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.003
Everything's exactly
how we were told it'd be.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.922
Including preparing for those!

01:30.507 --> 01:31.341
Pidge?

01:31.424 --> 01:34.594
Allura, I'm sending you the signals
to interfere with the drones.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.930
Signal acquired. Broadcasting.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.526
Let's take them out before
they recalibrate and report our approach.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.331
Form up on me. We're going in.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.794
We have five minutes
before the base realizes

02:07.877 --> 02:09.711
their drones aren't responding.

02:11.047 --> 02:14.676
Be careful to stay in formation
and don't touch the sides!

02:18.555 --> 02:20.640
Don't touch the side.
Don't touch the side.

02:20.723 --> 02:21.975
Don't touch the side.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.816
- Uh-oh!
- Hunk!

02:29.899 --> 02:32.819
I think I may have
nicked the side a little bit.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.820
Let me through!

02:44.831 --> 02:47.834
We'd better hurry.
That patch won't last long.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.090
We're under attack!

02:55.842 --> 02:57.093
It's Voltron!

02:57.677 --> 03:01.514
All forces, prepare for enemy assault.
This is not a drill.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.281
The lava's gaining on us!
We can't outrun it!

03:19.657 --> 03:22.118
We should be directly underneath
the Galra base.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.829
There's an opening up ahead. Follow me!

03:31.252 --> 03:32.879
Oh, no! We're trapped!

03:33.796 --> 03:34.923
No, we're not!

03:36.341 --> 03:37.759
There's another way out!

03:37.842 --> 03:39.385
Form Voltron!

04:33.773 --> 04:36.734
Stand down. Voltron is no more.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.949
Take down the factory machines!

04:58.673 --> 05:01.259
We have to get out of here!
To the escape pods!

05:21.863 --> 05:25.074
Oh, man! Going on missions is a lot easier
when somebody gives you

05:25.158 --> 05:27.285
the information you need
before you get there.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.413
And yet, you still managed
to run your lion into a wall.

05:30.496 --> 05:34.083
Yeah, information is one thing.
Ability is something completely different.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.045
No doubt about it,
we haven't encountered a single problem.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.839
I must admit,
we took down a vital target today.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.507
And we made it look pretty easy,

05:41.591 --> 05:43.885
except for the getting buried
in lava part.

05:43.968 --> 05:46.179
It may be time
to consider taking the next step.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.893
I'm still not comfortable with this.
It just doesn't feel right.

06:18.377 --> 06:21.881
- Your intel checked out.
- You still feign surprise.

06:22.965 --> 06:25.676
All of the information I've given,
proven correct.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.387
Every target I've provided,
easily dispatched.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.182
-Yet, you still look at me--
-As if you were the leader

06:31.265 --> 06:34.560
of the most bloodthirsty race of murderers
this universe has ever known.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.646
Can people not change?

06:36.729 --> 06:39.816
Is it so hard to believe
that I wish to return the Galra Empire

06:39.899 --> 06:41.901
to a bygone era of peace?

06:42.902 --> 06:47.365
Our fathers were friends once, long ago.
There must be hope for us.

06:48.282 --> 06:49.992
I guess we still need convincing.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.870
The facts speak for themselves.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.290
The Galra Empire is completely reliant
on quintessence.

06:56.374 --> 07:00.128
Serve that need peacefully,
and you have a complete paradigm shift,

07:00.211 --> 07:02.338
a new dawn for the old empire.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.632
And you're the man to make this happen?

07:04.715 --> 07:08.886
My plan from the beginning has been
to find a way to harvest quintessence

07:08.970 --> 07:11.681
without resorting
to the barbarism of the Komar.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.725
Extracting quintessence
from entire planets

07:14.809 --> 07:16.894
at the cost of every living thing?

07:16.978 --> 07:17.979
I think not.

07:18.563 --> 07:22.066
And your solution was to send Voltron
to do your dirty work.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.570
Only Voltron could retrieve
the trans-reality comet.

07:25.653 --> 07:30.908
So, yes, I'm afraid I had to be a bit
duplicitous in effecting its retrieval.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.120
But if the paladins were killed,
that would be fine for you, too.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.957
It was a calculated risk, I admit that.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.376
But I knew they'd come through
without a scratch.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.796
Since recovering the comet, I haven't
been in the least bit aggressive.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.049
-What about your generals?
-A simple misunderstanding.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.636
I had no idea our paths would cross
in the Ulippa System.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.305
What would I gain by fighting you?

07:52.388 --> 07:56.934
My sole focus has been finding a way
to enter the zone between realities.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.520
Sounds like you are your father's son.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.107
It was your father
who led the scientific exploration

08:03.191 --> 08:04.901
that discovered quintessence.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.821
An exploration, I might add,
that resulted in the creation of Voltron.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.074
This isn't a zero-sum game.

08:12.158 --> 08:16.787
Meeting the needs of the Galra Empire
means bringing peace to the universe.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.998
That is the future
enlightenment brings us,

08:19.081 --> 08:20.917
one of prosperity for all.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.296
I saved your lives
and the lives of all your comrades.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.716
I have given you target after target
in the Galra Empire,

08:28.799 --> 08:32.970
and all of them have been dismantled
or destroyed at no cost of life to you.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.515
All I ask is to be judged by my actions

08:36.599 --> 08:39.227
rather than your preconceptions
of my race.

08:39.809 --> 08:42.605
If that is beyond you,
then perhaps you should just finish me

08:42.688 --> 08:43.813
and get it over with.

08:45.483 --> 08:49.820
Clearly, Princess,
you are not ready to end this war.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.576
-Princess? The meeting's about to start.
-I'm almost ready.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.288
If I'm expected to lead this,
I need to know what I'm talking about.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.499
But no one expects you
to memorize everything.

09:01.582 --> 09:02.875
We can have a script-screen,

09:02.959 --> 09:05.461
or you could jot notes down
on the inside of your hand.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.214
I mean, I do it all the... uh, time.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.552
I'm kidding!

09:13.052 --> 09:15.054
Princess, everybody's ready.

09:18.015 --> 09:21.143
As of today,
our rebel forces have taken control

09:21.227 --> 09:23.896
of one-third of the former Galra Empire.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.566
But we cannot grow complacent.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.778
The Galra Empire is still
the dominant force in the universe.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.489
However, the tide is changing.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.827
The rebel coalition is winning
because of you, Princess Allura.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.829
You and Voltron.

09:39.912 --> 09:44.625
Mere cycles ago, I felt that my race
would breathe its last in Galra chains,

09:44.709 --> 09:50.131
but then Voltron appeared on the horizon,
and our lives changed forever!

09:50.214 --> 09:55.261
This bid for liberty is only possible
because of all of our sacrifices.

09:55.344 --> 09:59.390
And we still have a long way to go
before the entire universe is free.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.727
We'll be behind you every step of the way.

10:03.311 --> 10:07.148
Thank you.
We will reconvene soon. Until then.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.527
Did you complete raids
on targets we sent

10:11.611 --> 10:12.987
on our last communication?

10:13.070 --> 10:17.575
Yes. The information we've received
from Lotor has consistently checked out.

10:17.658 --> 10:21.746
With all these successful missions taking
place in such a short period of time,

10:21.829 --> 10:25.416
it won't be long before the Galra realizes
we're using inside information.

10:25.499 --> 10:29.253
That's true. We should expect the enemy
to change protocol soon.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.423
Then we need to act fast
and hit as many targets as possible.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.926
We'll talk to Lotor and see
if there's anything else he can give us.

10:36.385 --> 10:39.513
I can't stop thinking
that we might be an unwitting part

10:39.597 --> 10:41.599
of a much larger ulterior motive.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.145
Every lead I've provided you so far

10:46.228 --> 10:50.316
has been unerring, exact,
and relatively easy to accomplish.

10:50.399 --> 10:55.237
Anything I would give you now
would be somewhat more perilous in nature.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.698
We're listening.

10:58.282 --> 11:01.118
I have some information I believe
you would consider important

11:01.202 --> 11:02.912
on a more personal level.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.541
There is a prison,
formerly under my control.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.169
It houses a special inmate.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.425
Thank you for helping us
get the fleet back in order.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.011
They were banged up
after the invasion.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.096
No problem.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.391
We re-booted
the entire targeting system in this one.

11:23.474 --> 11:27.144
Pidge wrote a patch that will increase
accuracy by a power of three.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.981
Yeah, well, Matt overhauled
the thrusters on this one.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.193
It can pull out of a six-g dive
and not lose thrust.

11:34.276 --> 11:37.238
That's Newton's gravitational constant,
of course.

11:37.321 --> 11:40.950
Duh! What would she think,
9.8 meters per second squared?

11:43.953 --> 11:46.914
But we saved our best work for last.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.421
He looks brand-new!

11:53.504 --> 11:56.173
I can see myself in his chest plate.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.760
Pidge, you got a message incoming.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.596
-Hey, guys.
-Pidge.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.515
Is something wrong?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.017
We have a lead on Commander Holt.

12:07.852 --> 12:08.853
Your father.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.479
Our father?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.898
Lotor gave us information
on his whereabouts.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.024
Where is he?

12:14.108 --> 12:17.653
Because your father was considered
a valuable scientific asset,

12:17.736 --> 12:20.364
he was moved to a remote prison
with others like him.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.576
They're being forced to work
for the Galra Empire.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.911
According to Lotor,
he's still at the prison,

12:25.995 --> 12:28.038
but he could be transferred
at any moment.

12:28.122 --> 12:31.292
As soon as the teludav is repaired,
we can all head over there.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.711
Send us the coordinates.

12:34.211 --> 12:38.090
Pidge, Matt! If you wait for us,
we'll be able to provide you with backup.

12:38.549 --> 12:42.136
Hey, don't worry. We'll make sure
they got the backup they need.

12:42.219 --> 12:45.055
Bring them back safe.

12:45.806 --> 12:46.682
Good luck.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.691
What if something's happened
to him, Matt? What if--?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.861
We're gonna bring Dad back, I promise.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.661
Approaching the prison.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.916
This place is gonna have security.
We're gonna go headfirst into that?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.543
That's why we got cloaking.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.512
How did it detect us?

13:24.595 --> 13:26.388
Doesn't sound good.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.099
We've hit some sort of barrier!
We've lost cloaking!

13:32.102 --> 13:35.523
Galra fighters on intercept course!

13:46.242 --> 13:48.786
Change of plan!
I'm gonna have to drop you off!

13:50.412 --> 13:51.997
Hold on!

14:02.967 --> 14:03.968
Go get him, Matt.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.644
Everybody, fire jet packs!

14:20.109 --> 14:21.110
Uh... Uh...

14:21.193 --> 14:23.612
Something's wrong!
My pack's not working!

14:23.696 --> 14:27.283
Matt!

14:52.600 --> 14:55.728
-You know, you can let go of him now.
-I'd rather not.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.121
No guards.

15:14.788 --> 15:18.208
Security and defense systems
in this prison are completely automated.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.920
Override codes should
shut everything down.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.423
Uh, looks like everything
is already shut down.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.926
What's going on?

15:40.147 --> 15:41.315
Come on, girl!

15:54.203 --> 15:55.245
Stay with me, Green!

16:05.214 --> 16:06.966
Huh?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.056
Everyone, relax.

16:59.226 --> 17:02.146
Don't hurt us!

17:02.229 --> 17:04.189
No one's here to hurt you.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.943
-You're not with the scary lady?
-We're here to rescue you.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.653
Wait, what scary lady?

17:10.237 --> 17:13.656
She told us to stay inside.
If we went out, we'd be hurt.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.702
Well, no one is here now.
Come on, we're leaving.

17:23.916 --> 17:25.002
Is this everyone?

17:25.586 --> 17:27.921
No, there are others back in the cells.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.593
Everybody, hurry up and come with us.

17:36.221 --> 17:40.309
Hello? Dad? Dad, are you here?

17:42.770 --> 17:44.438
Has anyone here seen Sam Holt?

17:45.022 --> 17:48.567
A human like me.
Is-- Is there another human here?

18:17.262 --> 18:19.098
Pidge, we're ready for pick-up.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.767
I can't come get you! It's still too hot!

18:22.601 --> 18:25.854
If I fly down to pick you up,
I'll be leading all of these ships there.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.773
You'll be sitting ducks!

18:33.278 --> 18:35.364
We have to come up
with some other way

18:35.447 --> 18:37.157
to get the scientists off the planet.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.329
Pidge, what if I brought the group to you?

18:42.412 --> 18:46.458
-And how are we gonna do that?
-I've got an idea. Follow me.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.967
These pods are only meant
to carry five passengers.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.219
We'll be lucky
to break through the atmosphere.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.470
Yeah, yeah, I know.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.727
Come on, Matt. Where are you?

19:10.232 --> 19:11.984
-Let's go.
-But where's--?

19:12.067 --> 19:13.235
Let's go!

19:43.390 --> 19:44.933
Something's wrong.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.145
The thrusters are maxed out!

20:03.202 --> 20:06.288
Pidge, we're about as high
as this overloaded escape pod'll take us.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.374
-We could sure use a pick-up.
-On my way!

20:23.096 --> 20:24.348
Engines are failing!

20:40.739 --> 20:42.324
Hang on tight!

21:08.725 --> 21:10.185
Cloaking back online.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.570
Matt! Matt, did you find him?

21:20.654 --> 21:22.322
I'm sorry, Pidge.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.743
-No! Dad! Dad, where are you?
-He wasn't there.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.037
He was already gone.

21:30.247 --> 21:33.292
No. No...

21:33.375 --> 21:36.753
Don't give up, Pidge.
We know Dad's alive.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.797
We'll find him.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.684
Emperor Zarkon.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.395
What do you want?

21:54.479 --> 21:57.691
We have something in our possession
we think you'd be interested in.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.360
We are willing to trade it
for our safe passage

22:00.444 --> 22:01.862
back into the Galra ranks.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.656
I'm listening.

22:22.257 --> 22:23.842
Paladins of Voltron.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.094
Zarkon.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.639
I am making a one-time offer.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.726
I have someone of value to you.

22:37.647 --> 22:38.482
Dad!

22:39.649 --> 22:40.817
I will hand him over,

22:40.901 --> 22:45.614
and in exchange,
you give me my son Lotor.
