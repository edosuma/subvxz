WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:06.548
- How many people have you killed?
- Polly...

00:06.550 --> 00:08.050
No, don't.

00:09.729 --> 00:12.275
Your brother's been living at the casino.

00:12.277 --> 00:14.613
- Mahjong.
- He's a mahjong crackhead.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.347
Anne, what's going on? You okay?

00:16.350 --> 00:19.084
Some fella from
the casino offered me money

00:19.086 --> 00:20.231
to stay away from Dean.

00:20.233 --> 00:21.738
What kind of shit are you into?

00:21.740 --> 00:23.428
Mac and Melba ain't no good!

00:23.430 --> 00:25.394
No one forced Calvin to take drugs.

00:25.396 --> 00:27.775
- They dosed him!
- What's more believable?

00:27.775 --> 00:29.909
That someone secretly slipped him drugs

00:29.911 --> 00:31.911
or that an addict relapsed?

00:31.913 --> 00:35.181
Mac has been more of a father to
me than Calvin ever was, ever!

00:35.183 --> 00:36.848
D... Shit!

00:36.850 --> 00:39.318
- They got Dean.
- Who, Mac and crazy-ass Melba?

00:39.320 --> 00:41.120
I am done with this shit.

00:41.122 --> 00:43.655
D, what you gonna do? Run up
in there like you're Rambo?

00:43.657 --> 00:44.957
Watch me.

00:46.861 --> 00:49.572
You are not listening to me, Roller!

00:49.574 --> 00:51.597
D, baby, I'm listening.
You just need to simmer down.

00:51.599 --> 00:53.465
- Get out of my way.
- Gimme the piece.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.067
No. They got my brother.

00:55.069 --> 00:56.802
D, you step one foot in that casino,

00:56.804 --> 00:58.604
security's finna roll right up on you.

00:58.606 --> 01:00.272
Roller, I gotta do something.

01:00.274 --> 01:02.274
D, not like this. D, stop!

01:02.276 --> 01:04.275
D! Stop.

01:04.278 --> 01:06.212
I can't have you locked up.

01:06.214 --> 01:08.680
I just want my brother back.

01:08.682 --> 01:10.015
It's okay.

02:20.876 --> 02:24.690
Okay. So, the deal is,
no Christmas tip, no mail.

02:26.030 --> 02:28.294
Wait a minute. Christmas was about
six months ago, though.

02:28.296 --> 02:32.097
Oh, I know. I got a lot of her mail.

02:32.099 --> 02:33.899
I'm talking about government checks,

02:33.901 --> 02:35.301
- rebate checks, girl...
- Close your eyeball.

02:35.303 --> 02:38.570
...birth announcements,
wedding invitations...

02:38.572 --> 02:40.840
She done missed a lot of shit.

02:40.842 --> 02:43.509
But I still make sure
she gets her AARP catalogue

02:43.511 --> 02:45.377
to remind her that she old.

02:45.379 --> 02:46.912
Ohh, you a messy bish.

02:46.914 --> 02:48.314
I don't play.

02:49.984 --> 02:51.651
Y'all...

02:52.281 --> 02:53.653
What's wrong? What's going on?

02:53.655 --> 02:56.788
Roller just stopped me from
pulling a gun on Mac and Melba.

02:56.790 --> 02:59.191
- What are you talking about?
- They got Dean.

02:59.193 --> 03:01.060
- Kidnapped?
- He might as well be.

03:01.062 --> 03:03.128
I mean, they... they in his mind.

03:03.130 --> 03:05.331
- Hey, Sheray.
- Yeah, she's right.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.866
Dean is trippin'.

03:06.868 --> 03:09.134
This fool jumped outta the car last night

03:09.136 --> 03:11.603
and went back to the casino
just to play mahjong.

03:11.605 --> 03:13.133
What do they want from him?

03:13.135 --> 03:14.874
- What can we do?
- I don't know.

03:14.876 --> 03:16.275
Be still. You're about to mess it up.

03:16.277 --> 03:18.143
Now, calm down.
We can think of something.

03:18.145 --> 03:20.212
I feel like I'm losing him,
and I don't know what to do.

03:20.214 --> 03:22.081
His stuff is still back at the motel.

03:22.083 --> 03:23.749
He's got to come back eventually.

03:23.751 --> 03:25.284
Come on, bright idea.

03:25.286 --> 03:28.020
You coming with me. We'll be back.

03:28.022 --> 03:30.690
Hey, if y'all need me
to jack somebody's mail, now,

03:30.692 --> 03:32.291
let me know!

03:34.562 --> 03:36.295
I don't play that.

03:37.117 --> 03:41.705
Here's one thing I know...
Blood doesn't make a family.

03:42.036 --> 03:43.903
In fact, I would go so far as to say

03:43.905 --> 03:46.238
that your family has held you back.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.107
You're like a majestic golden eagle

03:48.109 --> 03:50.623
that somebody has locked in a cage,

03:50.625 --> 03:53.045
and your sister and her friends,
they're your captors.

03:53.047 --> 03:55.915
They're feeding you scraps
of rotten meat.

03:55.917 --> 03:58.650
You know, you eat that shit long
enough, it starts to taste good.

03:58.652 --> 04:00.853
I-I-I think you're using an analogy.

04:00.855 --> 04:03.455
Are... Are you saying
that I-I'm being silenced,

04:03.457 --> 04:06.192
like one of those sister wives
in a prairie dress?

04:06.194 --> 04:08.728
Your real family is a spiritual one,

04:08.730 --> 04:11.463
not one ordained by a birth certificate.

04:11.465 --> 04:12.732
Okay.

04:12.734 --> 04:14.867
Yes, your... your turn.

04:17.738 --> 04:20.672
Hey. What's the word, Polly Bird?

04:20.673 --> 04:22.742
Oh, hey, Roller.

04:22.744 --> 04:24.143
Um, you know, this little birdie's

04:24.145 --> 04:26.078
doing just fine... tweet tweet.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.548
You eatin' the soul out them shrimps.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.817
What's wrong, Polly? You a'ight?

04:31.753 --> 04:33.340
No.

04:34.222 --> 04:36.355
He's gone.

04:36.357 --> 04:38.490
I let him get away.

04:38.492 --> 04:39.691
Who, Dr. Ken?

04:39.693 --> 04:41.264
No, not Ken.

04:41.829 --> 04:43.563
I mean, he's sweet
and everything, but, no,

04:43.565 --> 04:45.765
- this was a real bad boy.
- Mm.

04:45.767 --> 04:48.167
- Yeah, he was good-lookin', too.
- Mm.

04:48.169 --> 04:50.035
But, um...

04:50.037 --> 04:52.317
I found out, you know, he was...

04:53.174 --> 04:54.173
He was killin' people.

04:54.175 --> 04:56.976
Pbht. You kicked him to the curb?

04:56.978 --> 04:58.978
Yeah. He's a murderer.

04:58.980 --> 05:01.118
Don't mean he's a bad guy.

05:01.849 --> 05:04.116
So you think I made a mistake?

05:04.118 --> 05:06.118
Maybe I should just go back to Bayside

05:06.120 --> 05:08.187
- and tell him I was wrong.
- Hold on one second.

05:08.189 --> 05:09.855
This guy work for Mac and Melba?

05:09.857 --> 05:11.857
Uh... what?

05:11.859 --> 05:14.526
Oh. No. No, no.
Uh, never mind, never mind.

05:14.528 --> 05:16.395
- Rewind.
- Rewind.

05:16.397 --> 05:18.530
Double rewind, Polly Bird.
You can't see this man.

05:18.532 --> 05:20.532
But you said you thought
maybe he wasn't a bad guy.

05:20.534 --> 05:23.803
Well, he is 'cause he's killin'
for those casino folks.

05:23.805 --> 05:26.606
Polly, you go and find yourself
a rough neck.

05:26.608 --> 05:27.807
We out there, baby.

05:27.809 --> 05:29.425
It's not the same.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.281
He's not gonna be happy about this.

05:35.283 --> 05:38.550
He hasn't been happy about
anything that I've done lately.

05:38.552 --> 05:39.952
But he needs this.

05:39.954 --> 05:42.955
The only choice we have is
for y'all to move in with me.

05:42.957 --> 05:44.824
I keep telling myself

05:44.826 --> 05:46.826
he's just obsessed with something new,

05:46.828 --> 05:49.354
like he was with stripping
and body building, but this?

05:49.356 --> 05:51.631
Mnh-mnh. This is more than that.

05:51.633 --> 05:53.299
Dean needs me.

05:53.301 --> 05:55.101
He has always needed me.

05:55.103 --> 05:56.969
And that ain't gonna change just 'cause

05:56.971 --> 05:58.437
he's under Mac and Melba's spell.

05:58.439 --> 05:59.458
I can tell you that.

05:59.483 --> 06:00.706
Yeah, yeah.

06:03.777 --> 06:06.112
D-D-Des, what... what are you doing here?

06:17.188 --> 06:18.724
What's that look for?

06:20.411 --> 06:21.727
I like this.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.395
Hmm?

06:23.397 --> 06:26.866
Waking up together, going out to lunch.

06:26.868 --> 06:30.202
It's nice. We're like a family.

06:30.204 --> 06:31.403
Yeah.

06:31.405 --> 06:33.873
All that's missing is a little one.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.141
After that whole adoption fiasco,

06:36.143 --> 06:39.345
I'm just not sure anymore.
I mean, think about it.

06:39.347 --> 06:41.947
The late nights, the vomiting,
the getting peed on.

06:42.594 --> 06:44.416
It'd be like being back in college.

06:46.420 --> 06:50.956
Besides, I love what we have, you know?

06:50.958 --> 06:52.932
- Just the two of us.
- Yeah.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.314
Totally.

06:54.696 --> 06:56.562
Just the two of us.

07:02.370 --> 07:05.021
I can't believe you came here and
packed me up like I'm a child!

07:05.023 --> 07:06.772
We're not in foster care anymore, Des!

07:06.774 --> 07:09.241
- This is what's best for you.
- You don't know what's best for me.

07:09.243 --> 07:10.710
Y-You don't even know me!

07:10.712 --> 07:12.712
I know your black ass
better than you know yourself,

07:12.714 --> 07:14.180
and you are coming with me.

07:14.182 --> 07:17.449
I told you, Des,
I don't want to cohabitate.

07:17.451 --> 07:19.564
And I told you,

07:19.589 --> 07:21.253
you're obsessed with mahjong.

07:21.255 --> 07:23.856
Dean, I can't let something
happen to you.

07:23.858 --> 07:25.324
Oh, God.

07:25.326 --> 07:28.394
It's... It's... It's... It's...
He's right.

07:28.396 --> 07:29.395
Who's right?

07:29.397 --> 07:31.931
Mac. Mac... h-he used an analogy.

07:31.933 --> 07:34.200
He said that I'm a majestic golden eagle

07:34.202 --> 07:36.001
and that you've been
keeping me in a cage!

07:36.003 --> 07:37.870
Dean, she's just trying to help you out.

07:37.872 --> 07:41.207
How? By controlling me?
Y-You can't stop me from flying!

07:41.209 --> 07:42.808
What kinda white-people shit is that?

07:42.810 --> 07:44.076
It's the truth!

07:44.078 --> 07:45.344
And... And... And... And... And...

07:45.346 --> 07:47.547
And I'm done with being held back!

07:47.549 --> 07:48.680
What?!

07:48.682 --> 07:52.218
I-I-I want you out of my life,
Desna Simms!

07:52.220 --> 07:53.957
Dean!

08:08.436 --> 08:11.704
I just cannot figure out
how the hell this happened.

08:11.706 --> 08:15.041
- I know.
- I mean, was I too overprotective?

08:15.043 --> 08:16.308
You think that's why
he turned his back on me?

08:16.310 --> 08:18.377
I mean, yes, you are overprotective,

08:18.379 --> 08:20.179
but that's not what's going on
right now with Dean.

08:20.181 --> 08:22.381
You have been a Goddamn saint
to him, and you know that.

08:22.383 --> 08:25.384
I have taken care of that boy
my entire life.

08:25.386 --> 08:27.854
- Well, you tell him.
- Always putting him before me,

08:27.856 --> 08:29.388
and he gonna say he don't want me?

08:29.390 --> 08:32.457
He is just going through
something, honey.

08:32.460 --> 08:33.991
H-He'll be back.

08:33.994 --> 08:35.928
Mac and Melba got him, Pol.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.663
What if they don't let him go?

08:37.664 --> 08:39.932
What do Mac and Melba want with
this boy in the first place?

08:39.933 --> 08:42.068
They already got you out of the casino.

08:42.070 --> 08:44.001
I don't know what I'm gonna do

08:44.004 --> 08:46.805
if Virginia can't talk
some sense into him.

08:51.612 --> 08:53.679
Dean, please look at me.

08:53.681 --> 08:55.481
I'm busy.

08:55.483 --> 08:58.217
I know there's some sort of pain
you're feeling.

08:58.219 --> 09:01.287
Uh, my sciatica's cleared up.
Thank you, thank you.

09:01.289 --> 09:03.155
Mahjong!

09:08.229 --> 09:12.231
Let the pain go before you lose
Des and everyone who loves you!

09:12.233 --> 09:14.100
You... you're...
You know what my pain is?

09:14.102 --> 09:17.103
You are! You need to back
the heck up, Virginia!

09:17.105 --> 09:19.438
Let me... Let me out of my cage!

09:19.440 --> 09:22.575
Okay, Dean, I get it.
Listen, you are a falcon.

09:22.577 --> 09:26.178
I'm a majestic golden eagle!
You don't even understand!

09:26.180 --> 09:28.714
Wh-What happened to my Virginia, huh?

09:28.716 --> 09:31.250
Th-The sweet, supportive girl
that I fell in love with,

09:31.252 --> 09:32.985
what happened to her?

09:32.987 --> 09:34.853
Oh, I'll tell you what happened.

09:34.855 --> 09:37.323
I've been livin' in that
raggedy-ass motel with you,

09:37.325 --> 09:39.458
laying on bed bugs, not even trippin'

09:39.460 --> 09:42.128
when you made me label all my thongs!

09:42.130 --> 09:44.663
But you? You've been in here
day and night,

09:44.665 --> 09:46.799
playing with these stupid-ass tiles,

09:46.801 --> 09:48.801
thinking you're...
thinking you're Rain Man!

09:48.803 --> 09:50.573
Virginia, shh!

09:54.742 --> 09:56.408
- Virginia...
- What?

09:56.410 --> 09:58.076
...I don't think I can be with somebody

09:58.078 --> 10:00.146
who treats me with so little respect.

10:02.150 --> 10:05.551
So... you're breaking up with me?

10:07.087 --> 10:08.174
Yeah.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.890
Dean, I love you.

10:11.892 --> 10:12.971
Yeah.

10:13.628 --> 10:15.294
Uh...

10:15.296 --> 10:18.364
Yeah, go away, Virginia. Go away.

10:18.366 --> 10:20.633
I-I'm moving in to the casino.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.908
Hey!

10:35.516 --> 10:38.184
All right, y'all, you come back, okay?

10:39.453 --> 10:41.320
Keep that insurance, uh, updated.

10:41.322 --> 10:43.389
Important.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.724
Hey, Dr. Ken, where you off to?

10:45.726 --> 10:47.726
You got a hot date
with that hot little thing?

10:47.728 --> 10:49.408
What's her name? Gretel?

10:49.410 --> 10:50.596
Gretchen.

10:50.598 --> 10:52.264
You know, to be honest,

10:52.266 --> 10:54.266
I can barely afford to take her out.

10:54.268 --> 10:56.602
You know, this whole legit rehab thing

10:56.604 --> 10:59.605
is seriously threatening
my baller status.

10:59.607 --> 11:01.474
Come on, now, Dr. Ken.

11:01.476 --> 11:03.609
We are... We are changin' people.

11:03.611 --> 11:06.278
We're... We're changin' the world.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.280
I don't care about the world.

11:08.282 --> 11:10.149
I care about me. Okay?

11:10.151 --> 11:11.950
I'm a desirable commodity.

11:11.952 --> 11:13.752
And you know, Peter Pain is hiring.

11:13.754 --> 11:15.688
So if things don't start
to pick up at the clinic,

11:15.690 --> 11:18.090
I'm gonna have to seek greener pastures.

11:18.092 --> 11:19.758
You've been warned.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.427
Don't warn <i> me,</i> boy.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.632
How about you, Miss Brenda?

11:26.634 --> 11:29.368
- You got any complaints?
- No, I'm great.

11:29.370 --> 11:31.720
Sober as a nun on Easter Sunday.

11:31.722 --> 11:32.893
Hmm.

11:32.895 --> 11:35.374
Problem is, without my rum and coke,

11:35.376 --> 11:38.377
I don't know what to do
with myself anymore.

11:38.379 --> 11:41.114
Well, Goddamn.

11:42.517 --> 11:46.853
I-I-I gotta say, I think that
way sometimes myself, you know?

11:47.440 --> 11:49.818
What say you let me...

11:50.258 --> 11:52.591
show you a good time?

11:59.067 --> 12:00.867
Well?

12:02.019 --> 12:06.072
I tried to do my thing
with Dean, but it didn't work.

12:06.074 --> 12:07.740
W-What happened?

12:07.742 --> 12:09.341
He broke up with me.

12:09.343 --> 12:11.343
He broke off the engagement? Come here.

12:11.345 --> 12:13.479
I'm sorry. I tried, Des. I'm sorry.

12:13.481 --> 12:16.415
I really, really tried to help.

12:16.886 --> 12:19.618
Listen, it's not your fault, okay?

12:19.620 --> 12:22.688
Well, tell us what happened.

12:22.690 --> 12:26.092
Uh, well, he...

12:26.855 --> 12:29.095
He said that I hold him back.

12:31.232 --> 12:33.699
I'm so heartbroken, you guys.

12:33.701 --> 12:35.634
It hurts so bad.

12:35.636 --> 12:38.036
China Doll, you don't deserve this, okay?

12:38.038 --> 12:41.039
And... And as soon as we're on
the other side of all of this,

12:41.041 --> 12:42.575
we got you.

12:42.577 --> 12:45.043
We will all get together
and eat our feelings and...

12:45.045 --> 12:47.446
- Oh, hell yeah. Flamin' Hot Cheetos.
- Mm-hmm.

12:47.448 --> 12:49.248
- Yep.
- "Love and Hip Hop" marathons.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.383
- Cornish hens.
- Well...

12:51.385 --> 12:53.252
All of it. But right now,

12:53.254 --> 12:54.720
baby girl, you've got to pull up,

12:54.722 --> 12:57.055
'cause we've got to figure out
what to do about Dean.

12:57.057 --> 12:59.191
- Okay?
- Okay.

13:04.265 --> 13:05.531
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:05.533 --> 13:07.270
Come on in.

13:08.803 --> 13:09.936
Ooh, whoa.

13:11.139 --> 13:14.072
My daughter is livin' large, huh?

13:14.074 --> 13:15.942
Well...

13:15.944 --> 13:18.311
Little bit.

13:19.413 --> 13:21.213
How you feeling?

13:21.701 --> 13:23.316
Like shit.

13:24.418 --> 13:26.218
What about you?

13:26.220 --> 13:27.486
Lost my job.

13:27.488 --> 13:29.822
Calvin, I'm... I'm so sorry.

13:29.824 --> 13:31.157
Come sit down.

13:31.159 --> 13:35.494
Yeah, the firm didn't believe my story.

13:35.496 --> 13:37.029
They think I drugged myself.

13:37.031 --> 13:39.832
They don't believe
those lunatics drugged me.

13:39.834 --> 13:42.835
If it wasn't for you,
I'd go right to the cops.

13:42.837 --> 13:45.838
But those assholes messed up my life,

13:46.284 --> 13:47.840
and they're ruining yours.

13:48.776 --> 13:51.444
Not just me. They got Dean.

13:51.446 --> 13:53.980
He stopped talking to me.

13:53.982 --> 13:56.315
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

13:56.317 --> 13:57.820
Hey...

13:58.453 --> 14:00.853
It'll be all right, hear?

14:33.821 --> 14:36.288
H-Hello?

14:36.290 --> 14:38.424
What's up? I haven't heard from you.

14:38.426 --> 14:41.027
Yeah, just been...

14:41.029 --> 14:42.991
going through some stuff.

14:43.866 --> 14:45.698
Hey, are you okay?

14:45.700 --> 14:47.233
Yeah, I-I guess.

14:47.235 --> 14:49.368
Look, what's wrong?

14:49.789 --> 14:52.104
<i>Look, if you want to talk, I'm free.</i>

14:59.179 --> 15:00.312
He'll be here in a second.

15:00.314 --> 15:02.381
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:03.651 --> 15:05.784
Oh. What the heck?!

15:05.786 --> 15:07.920
I-I thought you said
mahjong master Zhao Jian

15:07.922 --> 15:09.388
wanted to meet me.

15:09.390 --> 15:10.989
- You're a liar.
- Dean,

15:10.991 --> 15:14.460
our father has a home in Sanibel
Island, a beach house.

15:14.462 --> 15:16.462
He wants us to live together as a family.

15:16.464 --> 15:18.330
It's too late for that now.

15:18.332 --> 15:20.533
Dean, listen to me.

15:20.535 --> 15:23.001
Okay, this is our chance
at a normal life.

15:23.003 --> 15:25.003
You've always wanted me
out of a life of crime.

15:25.005 --> 15:27.205
I-I-I already have a life now,
and I'm... and I'm happy.

15:27.207 --> 15:29.942
Why can't you just accept that?
I-It's not always about you.

15:29.944 --> 15:31.944
You... You can't always
get what you want.

15:31.946 --> 15:35.081
What <i> I</i> want? I gave up my life
to take care of you.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.884
Just because I'm autistic,
that doesn't mean you have to control me!

15:37.886 --> 15:40.753
If you want to help me, then you
should help me fulfill my dreams!

15:40.755 --> 15:42.020
That's what you should do.

15:42.022 --> 15:44.490
Dean, your dreams change
every five minutes.

15:44.492 --> 15:46.292
One minute, you want to be
a body builder,

15:46.294 --> 15:47.560
then you want to draw,

15:47.562 --> 15:49.027
then you want to be
in muscle competitions,

15:49.029 --> 15:50.296
then you want to dance with Polly's boys.

15:50.298 --> 15:51.898
But those things are just hobbies.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.300
Mahjong is my calling, a-and Mac
believes I can be the best.

15:54.302 --> 15:57.035
Mac is a con artist, Dean,
and he's full of shit!

15:57.037 --> 15:59.305
He's my family, a-and he's
treated me with more respect

15:59.307 --> 16:01.774
than you ever, ever have, Desi, ever!

16:01.776 --> 16:04.911
- You never give me respect.
- How could you say that to me?!

16:04.913 --> 16:07.113
- How?!
- Security!

16:07.115 --> 16:09.115
- S-Security!
- Really? That's what we doin'?!

16:09.117 --> 16:10.509
Remove that lady 'cause she's...
she's banned from here!

16:10.534 --> 16:11.650
Do not do this, Dean!

16:11.652 --> 16:13.920
- She's banned!
- Dean, please!

16:13.922 --> 16:15.721
Dean, please!

16:15.723 --> 16:19.391
Desna's not gonna be
satisfied till she gets Dean back.

16:19.393 --> 16:20.993
Don't worry, sex burger.

16:20.995 --> 16:22.995
We'll just have to draw a line
she can't cross.

16:22.997 --> 16:25.531
Maybe we should just kill her.

16:25.533 --> 16:28.066
We'd be the first ones they finger.

16:28.068 --> 16:31.471
But I have an idea
that will shield us from her.

16:34.942 --> 16:37.109
So embarrassed.

16:37.111 --> 16:40.179
I mean, Th-this boy had me
thrown out of this casino

16:40.181 --> 16:42.248
like I was a Goddamn bag of garbage.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.116
- Ohh.
- This shit's gone too far.

16:44.118 --> 16:45.851
It's just so creepy.

16:45.853 --> 16:48.187
It's like the final days of Jonestown.

16:48.189 --> 16:49.343
I was there.

16:49.345 --> 16:51.383
- Well, the boy done drank the Kool-Aid.
- Yes.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.058
You need another way into Bayside.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.127
The only thing I can see is...

16:55.129 --> 16:57.597
I-is leveraging what we got
against the Governor.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.932
Ohh! That's a smart idea.

16:59.934 --> 17:02.734
The sex party, the bribes,
the private prisons...

17:02.736 --> 17:05.271
I'm thinking I could blackmail Patel

17:05.272 --> 17:08.339
into forcing Mac and Melba
to let me back in the casino,

17:08.342 --> 17:11.277
and then at least I'm close
enough to try to get Dean back.

17:11.279 --> 17:14.012
Great. Okay. So, uh,
how do we get to Patel?

17:14.015 --> 17:16.748
It's gonna be so easy.
He's on the campaign trail.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.349
- What?
- He's in Sarasota today.

17:18.352 --> 17:20.019
He's in Tampa tomorrow.

17:20.021 --> 17:22.087
Emerson Point Elementary... very close...

17:22.089 --> 17:24.089
with a wonderful-sounding
initiative called

17:24.092 --> 17:26.558
"Armed Teachers Save Schools."

17:26.560 --> 17:28.094
- No.
- Tool.

17:28.096 --> 17:31.497
I know exactly where
my black ass is going.

17:46.247 --> 17:48.314
- Hey, come on!
- Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

17:48.316 --> 17:50.449
Whoo!

17:51.993 --> 17:54.987
Yeah! Yeah!

18:20.414 --> 18:23.949
Ohh, something is wrong with me.

18:23.951 --> 18:27.687
V, there is nothing wrong with you.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.120
You're perfect.

18:29.823 --> 18:31.469
You don't know the real me.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.180
I was a hot mess.

18:34.828 --> 18:38.630
But then, I met Dean, and I finally...

18:38.632 --> 18:40.299
liked who I was.

18:42.436 --> 18:45.170
I shouldn't be talking
to you about any of this.

18:45.172 --> 18:48.508
Hey, hey, hey. Listen, it's okay.

18:48.510 --> 18:51.643
All right? You're gonna be okay.

18:51.645 --> 18:53.445
EJ, we're here, bae.

18:53.447 --> 18:56.315
Brienne has got to pee like a racehorse.

18:56.317 --> 18:57.717
What the?

18:57.719 --> 18:59.205
Oh.

19:00.054 --> 19:01.854
Is this what we're doin' now?

19:01.856 --> 19:04.524
Why is Black Daddy with China Doll?

19:04.526 --> 19:06.192
Baby, why don't you just go
ahead and go on to the bathroom?

19:06.194 --> 19:07.859
Hurry. I know you gotta go.

19:07.861 --> 19:10.329
Hold up. Eric is your baby daddy?

19:10.911 --> 19:12.598
- I didn't know that.
- Yes, you did, girl.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.400
There's pictures of us
all over the 'Gram.

19:14.402 --> 19:16.869
- Girl, I don't follow you.
- What?

19:16.871 --> 19:18.670
- Don't trip, please.
- E-Exactly.

19:18.672 --> 19:20.740
Me and Eric haven't even done anything...

19:20.742 --> 19:22.608
You know, actually, I don't want
to hear any more shit about it,

19:22.610 --> 19:25.211
'cause you a ho
and you always been a ho, okay?

19:25.213 --> 19:27.413
Since your mama picked
your daddy up on the stroll.

19:27.415 --> 19:29.815
And his name is EJ.

19:29.817 --> 19:31.883
I'm gonna go get my daughter.

19:31.885 --> 19:33.565
This custody thing ain't working out.

19:33.567 --> 19:36.288
Oh, I hope you catch my herpes, bitch.

19:40.494 --> 19:42.628
I don't want her to be hurt, but I...

19:42.630 --> 19:46.098
Sometimes you just got to
rip the Band-Aid off.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.833
That's what being an adult is.

19:47.835 --> 19:50.436
Oh. Okay.

19:50.438 --> 19:54.106
Moving in to the casino
is exactly what you need.

19:54.108 --> 19:56.576
It's an escape,
a-a chance to start fresh.

19:56.578 --> 19:59.044
That's what we're gonna do
on our private island.

19:59.046 --> 20:02.626
- Uh, w-where is it?
- Right here, next to Nassau.

20:02.628 --> 20:03.783
Oh.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.652
It is a paradise where cockatiels sing

20:06.654 --> 20:10.590
and wild boars feast
on sweet, sweet coconut.

20:10.592 --> 20:13.393
That sounds like the island that
Jodie Foster went to in "Contact."

20:13.395 --> 20:15.727
Right after she went
through the wormhole.

20:15.729 --> 20:17.797
Yes, yes. It is like that.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.065
And that's where we're gonna
build the new school.

20:20.067 --> 20:23.936
Native American kids
will attend free of charge.

20:23.938 --> 20:27.139
It was terrible what they did to us.

20:27.141 --> 20:29.609
So we're gonna give kids like me
their culture back,

20:29.611 --> 20:31.410
undo some of the damage.

20:31.412 --> 20:34.480
We just need the money
to help fund this thing.

20:34.482 --> 20:37.082
My sister was totally wrong
about you guys.

20:37.084 --> 20:39.551
Oh, we know. We know.

20:39.553 --> 20:42.354
I want this school to be my legacy,

20:42.356 --> 20:44.556
since my seed could find no purchase

20:44.558 --> 20:46.892
in Melba's beautiful womb.

20:46.894 --> 20:49.161
Did you try in-vitro fertilization?

20:49.163 --> 20:51.067
The treatments didn't take.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.699
Which is why there's something that, um,

20:53.701 --> 20:56.502
we would like to ask you.

20:56.504 --> 20:59.571
It should be no surprise that we've both

20:59.573 --> 21:03.309
become extremely attached to you.

21:03.311 --> 21:05.444
T-The sentiment is returned.

21:07.581 --> 21:09.781
What are you doing later this evening?

21:16.124 --> 21:17.723
Governor Patel.

21:17.725 --> 21:19.345
How y'all doing?

21:19.927 --> 21:22.061
Sorry, do I know you?

21:22.063 --> 21:26.598
You don't recognize me
without my mask and cape on.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.468
Yeah, um...

21:28.470 --> 21:30.736
w-why don't you join me in my office?

21:36.404 --> 21:38.478
What can I do you for?

21:38.480 --> 21:42.014
I think you and I could
work really well together,

21:42.016 --> 21:45.351
especially since we got along
so good at that party.

21:45.353 --> 21:47.353
Well, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:47.355 --> 21:49.221
And the only work I do is for the people

21:49.223 --> 21:50.690
of the great state of Florida.

21:50.692 --> 21:53.025
We ain't come here to play games, Trip.

21:53.027 --> 21:55.227
We know about the money laundering,

21:55.229 --> 21:57.029
and this one here's the best in the game.

21:57.031 --> 21:59.231
Son, that ain't nothing to brag about.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.167
Money laundering's against the law.

22:01.169 --> 22:03.435
Mm-hmm. But what's also against the law

22:03.437 --> 22:06.706
is taking bribes to build
your private prison

22:06.708 --> 22:10.376
and then doubling down
while washing that money

22:10.378 --> 22:13.112
- at Bayside Casino.
- What a colorful story.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.047
It gets better.

22:15.049 --> 22:18.250
You are gonna help us flip
the script on Mac and Melba,

22:18.252 --> 22:20.319
or I'm gonna sing like a Goddamn bird.

22:20.321 --> 22:22.388
And I'm-a tell everything I know,

22:22.390 --> 22:26.592
especially about your freaky
little sex parties.

22:26.594 --> 22:29.261
Wait, do you mean the one
at Mar-a-Iago next week?

22:29.263 --> 22:32.264
- Do you think this is a joke?
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:32.793 --> 22:34.333
Look, this was cute.

22:34.335 --> 22:36.936
Now, get the hell out of here.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.871
Have a nice day, now.

22:38.873 --> 22:40.384
Good to see you again.

22:42.877 --> 22:45.211
Don't y'all forget to vote.

22:50.852 --> 22:53.853
It's too bad they took
our phones at the fetish party.

22:53.855 --> 22:56.121
We could've done some damage
with that video.

22:56.123 --> 22:57.590
Mm, probably for the best.

22:57.592 --> 22:59.592
We don't want <i> your</i> sex tape
gettin' out there.

22:59.594 --> 23:01.727
Hey, Polly Bird,

23:01.729 --> 23:04.063
why don't you call your rude boy
from Bayside? He could help.

23:05.159 --> 23:08.067
Why, I have no idea what
you're talking about, Roller.

23:08.069 --> 23:10.603
What you mean? He gave you the D.

23:10.605 --> 23:13.539
What's up, Polly? Come on, now.

23:13.541 --> 23:15.540
Are you smashing Joe?

23:15.542 --> 23:17.476
Jesus, Roller, I can't tell you anything!

23:17.478 --> 23:19.544
How come you been lying all this time?

23:19.546 --> 23:21.080
It's over, okay? It was nothing.

23:21.082 --> 23:23.082
We... We barely had
any connection at all.

23:23.084 --> 23:24.549
So why didn't you tell us about it?

23:24.551 --> 23:26.018
'Cause her ass knew she was wrong!

23:26.020 --> 23:28.554
I made a mistake, okay?
I'm really sorry, y'all.

23:28.556 --> 23:30.155
Were you with him at the orgy?

23:30.157 --> 23:32.825
I was perfectly behaved
at the orgy, okay?

23:32.827 --> 23:34.493
Unlike some people, who spread their legs

23:34.495 --> 23:36.896
- for the first Frenchman to say bonjour!
- A'ight, I'm out.

23:36.898 --> 23:38.413
What does that have to do with anything?

23:38.438 --> 23:40.020
- Well...
- You're not supposed to...

23:40.045 --> 23:42.167
Hold it! Hey!

23:42.169 --> 23:43.702
Hey!

23:46.107 --> 23:47.706
- You.
- Yeah.

23:47.708 --> 23:51.244
Your Frenchman, is he connected
to the Governor in any way?

23:51.246 --> 23:54.713
Etienne? Most definitely. He was
one of the snakes paying him bribes.

23:54.715 --> 23:56.782
What do we know about him?

23:56.784 --> 23:59.184
Only that his name
is Etienne Luques Chegal,

23:59.186 --> 24:02.054
he's COO of Sarasota
Greater Electric and Power,

24:02.056 --> 24:04.790
he's been there 10 years,
no record of STDs.

24:04.792 --> 24:06.525
- Damn!
- What?

24:06.527 --> 24:08.261
I research my dick.

24:08.263 --> 24:10.329
You all should do the same.

24:10.331 --> 24:12.381
Take that into consideration.

24:12.383 --> 24:14.867
But what would really serve us...

24:14.869 --> 24:17.002
he's under investigation for fraud.

24:17.004 --> 24:18.040
Yes.

24:18.042 --> 24:21.140
We are gonna pay his French ass a visit.

24:21.142 --> 24:22.141
Let's do it.

24:22.143 --> 24:25.544
At least one of us
used our pussy for good.

24:25.546 --> 24:28.747
That's me. Right here.

24:28.749 --> 24:30.950
Sorry, y'all.

24:38.559 --> 24:40.693
She went to the Governor?

24:40.695 --> 24:42.227
What do you want to do about it, Lamb?

24:42.229 --> 24:44.897
We need to accelerate our exit strategy.

24:44.899 --> 24:47.232
It's time to cash in on Dean.

24:47.234 --> 24:50.436
Oh, Dean is extremely important to me.

24:52.307 --> 24:53.639
More important than me?

24:53.641 --> 24:56.241
Oh, never, my treasure.

25:08.123 --> 25:10.589
You're too close to him.

25:10.591 --> 25:13.058
Dean is a mark.

25:13.060 --> 25:14.660
Remember that.

25:29.677 --> 25:32.345
- May I help you?
- Bonjour.

25:35.616 --> 25:38.483
- Remember me?
- What do you want?

25:38.485 --> 25:40.153
My family is right inside.

25:40.155 --> 25:42.755
We want information about Governor Patel,

25:42.757 --> 25:44.223
and we know that your ass

25:44.225 --> 25:47.493
is already under investigation
for fraud, so...

25:47.495 --> 25:50.495
Board of directors might want to
know about the bribes to the Governor

25:50.497 --> 25:53.232
and the private prisons, so...

25:53.234 --> 25:55.568
Like anyone would believe you.

25:55.570 --> 25:56.902
Au revoir.

25:56.904 --> 25:59.505
Or I can tell your wife I'm pregnant.

25:59.507 --> 26:02.307
Keep your voice down, okay?
How do you even know it's mine?

26:02.309 --> 26:04.910
Maybe Madame Chegal
would like to pay for a DNA test.

26:04.912 --> 26:06.311
Hey.

26:06.313 --> 26:09.114
Otherwise, I suggest you start talking.

26:09.116 --> 26:12.819
You heard the woman.
Tell us what we want to know.

26:14.121 --> 26:17.857
There's a judge.
His name is Richard Whitman.

26:17.859 --> 26:21.927
He is helping Patel
by over-sentencing minorities

26:21.929 --> 26:24.663
and funneling them
into Patel's private prisons,

26:24.665 --> 26:26.399
all for kickbacks.

26:26.401 --> 26:27.888
You don't say.

26:31.672 --> 26:34.207
Girl, you slapped the shit out of him.

26:34.209 --> 26:37.342
- He didn't see that coming.
- Please. He loved it.

26:38.679 --> 26:41.346
Oh, my favorite part about all of it

26:41.348 --> 26:43.682
is that you said you was pregnant.

26:43.684 --> 26:46.085
We got all the information we needed.

26:46.087 --> 26:48.221
I was serious.

26:48.223 --> 26:49.822
Say what now?

26:49.824 --> 26:52.225
I got a li'l French fry inside of me.

26:52.227 --> 26:54.560
Oh, my goodne...

26:54.562 --> 26:58.231
Girl, I thought only Halle Berry
could get pregnant at our age.

26:58.233 --> 27:00.299
I'm younger than Halle Berry. And you.

27:00.301 --> 27:02.101
Careful.

27:02.103 --> 27:04.314
What did Arlene say?

27:05.274 --> 27:06.906
I-I haven't told her yet.

27:06.908 --> 27:08.043
Why?

27:08.068 --> 27:09.642
She doesn't want to have
babies anymore, so I...

27:09.644 --> 27:12.511
- Unh-unh, unh-unh.
- She changed her mind.

27:12.513 --> 27:15.848
- Hey... you got to say something.
- I know.

27:15.850 --> 27:19.384
If y'all gonna try
to walk it out, tell her.

27:19.386 --> 27:21.587
- I know.
- Yeah.

27:21.589 --> 27:24.389
Ooh! We havin' us a baby!

27:24.391 --> 27:25.791
You psyched?

27:25.793 --> 27:27.392
I can't wait!

27:27.394 --> 27:29.757
I just can't believe
Virginia would do that.

27:30.331 --> 27:33.332
I mean, I know Dean's been
off his rocker, right?

27:33.334 --> 27:34.867
But to go after EJ?

27:35.365 --> 27:36.735
And, by the way, this custody agreement

27:36.737 --> 27:38.938
is gonna be a real big mistake, so...

27:38.940 --> 27:40.873
I can't believe you've been
running your mouth

27:40.875 --> 27:42.608
for 15 minutes straight about this.

27:42.610 --> 27:44.543
Uh, you're my husband.

27:44.545 --> 27:47.079
- I'm allowed to vent.
- Mm.

27:47.081 --> 27:50.215
Yeah, well, your venting
is sounding a lot like jealousy.

27:50.694 --> 27:53.752
I'm not jealous, Bryce.
This is about codes, okay?

27:53.754 --> 27:56.021
You don't sleep with your friends' exes,

27:56.023 --> 27:57.822
and your exes sure as hell don't
sleep with your girlfriends.

27:57.847 --> 27:58.958
Okay, okay.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.559
Well, what about
the... the marriage code?

28:00.561 --> 28:02.295
You know, the one, uh, where
you don't screw around

28:02.297 --> 28:04.297
- on your husband?
- Wow!

28:04.299 --> 28:06.765
You're gonna throw that
in my face right now?

28:06.767 --> 28:08.337
Jenn, relax.

28:08.836 --> 28:12.237
My point is, we're all gray.

28:12.883 --> 28:16.108
Hey, "Get It, Get It" principle number 13

28:16.110 --> 28:18.978
is "Forgiveness Not Bankruptcy."

28:18.980 --> 28:20.513
Christ on toast, Bryce,
I really don't think

28:20.515 --> 28:23.316
it's the best time to talk
about your book, either.

28:25.586 --> 28:28.187
Well...

28:28.607 --> 28:29.855
Maybe you should look at it

28:29.857 --> 28:32.391
from, uh, Virginia's perspective.

28:32.393 --> 28:35.128
You know, her fiancé just dumped her.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.262
She's probably just looking
for a shoulder to cry on.

28:37.264 --> 28:38.798
Maybe EJ's just being a good friend.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.465
You know, I don't think
these are beer-battered,

28:40.467 --> 28:42.135
- and I'm gonna take them back.
- Baby, baby...

28:42.137 --> 28:43.413
Babe!

28:44.205 --> 28:47.206
One thing I do know about life is...

28:47.626 --> 28:49.709
people are gonna shit all over you.

28:51.412 --> 28:56.015
If you hold on to that,
you lose everything.

28:57.427 --> 28:59.138
But you forgive 'em...

29:00.287 --> 29:03.556
well, you're as good as sittin'
on a pile of gold.

29:08.896 --> 29:10.829
Life's just easier that way.

29:16.971 --> 29:20.073
So, did you talk to Dean
about Sanibel Island?

29:21.308 --> 29:25.378
I did, but I'm gonna need
a little more time, Calvin.

29:25.873 --> 29:29.182
Don't worry, though. I do have
my foot on Mac and Melba's neck.

29:29.543 --> 29:31.670
Desna, I'm gonna have to go.

29:32.754 --> 29:35.855
I want you to pack your shit,
get the hell on outta here.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.390
Calvin, I can't. I mean...

29:37.392 --> 29:38.924
Now, listen to me, listen to me.

29:38.926 --> 29:41.727
Now, I... I can deal with losing my job.

29:41.729 --> 29:44.329
I was about to retire anyway.

29:44.331 --> 29:48.734
But I can't deal
with losing you and Dean.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.003
I just found you.

29:52.673 --> 29:54.807
I don't want to lose you, either.

29:55.152 --> 29:57.076
Well, then, come on.

29:57.078 --> 29:59.212
Let's get the hell on out of here.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.414
I'm too old to be out there,

30:01.416 --> 30:04.016
messing around with that shit out there.

30:04.018 --> 30:06.685
That's why I can't live in your world.

30:06.687 --> 30:10.956
And I can't live in yours,
not without Dean.

30:10.958 --> 30:14.560
If, uh, you need anything,
anything at all,

30:14.562 --> 30:17.162
you pick up that phone, and you call me.

30:17.164 --> 30:18.631
You understand me?

30:27.041 --> 30:28.774
This is fun, right?

30:28.776 --> 30:30.309
Did they have the blue Alizé?

30:30.311 --> 30:32.445
- I got you a double!
- Oh!

30:32.447 --> 30:34.713
Cheers!

30:34.715 --> 30:38.885
May I have your attention, please?

30:42.723 --> 30:45.390
Melba and I want to thank all of you

30:45.392 --> 30:48.393
for making it out to
the Hunting Grounds tonight!

30:48.395 --> 30:51.464
Are you guys having fun?!

30:51.466 --> 30:52.798
I can't hear you!

30:55.470 --> 30:57.402
Melba and I want to share with you

30:57.404 --> 31:00.539
a very special and personal
performance art piece

31:00.541 --> 31:02.675
with you this evening.

31:11.018 --> 31:13.552
Are you ready to give life, my love?

31:13.554 --> 31:16.221
Yes, baby.

31:16.223 --> 31:19.558
In that case, without further ado...

31:24.431 --> 31:26.766
- Push! Push through the pain!
- Aah!

31:26.768 --> 31:28.233
Push, my love!

31:28.235 --> 31:30.303
Push! Push! Push!

31:30.305 --> 31:32.571
- Push, darling, push!
- Push! Push!

31:32.573 --> 31:34.707
Push! Push! Push!

31:34.709 --> 31:36.509
Push! Push, darling, push!

31:36.511 --> 31:38.644
Push! Push! Push, my love! Push!

31:38.646 --> 31:41.113
Push! Push! Push!

31:41.115 --> 31:42.982
- Ugh!
- Aah!

31:42.984 --> 31:44.784
A boy is born!

31:48.389 --> 31:50.123
It's a boy!

31:53.795 --> 31:55.594
You're my son now.

31:55.596 --> 31:58.331
Oh, my baby!

32:15.016 --> 32:16.215
Is there a doctor in the house?!

32:20.508 --> 32:23.088
Dr. Ken, is M... is...
is Mama Melba gonna be okay?

32:23.090 --> 32:24.690
What's in her tank?

32:24.692 --> 32:26.625
What's <i> not</i> in her tank?

32:26.627 --> 32:28.227
She's hooked.

32:28.229 --> 32:30.829
Does anyone have any naloxone?

32:40.841 --> 32:43.042
My love! My... My sweet.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.844
Oh, you almost died in childbirth.

32:45.846 --> 32:48.714
Thank you. I owe you.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.916
I'm just doing my job.

32:56.858 --> 32:59.525
I don't know what I'mma do about Dean.

32:59.527 --> 33:01.854
- Hmm?
- Mnh-mnh.

33:01.856 --> 33:05.198
And if we don't start
making some real money,

33:05.200 --> 33:07.800
our asses is gonna end up
on Section Eight.

33:07.802 --> 33:09.468
Hey!

33:09.470 --> 33:12.471
Hey, what you talking about?
I'mma take care of you.

33:12.473 --> 33:15.074
And you ain't lose Dean yet. Right?

33:15.076 --> 33:19.045
You're right. I just gotta stay focused.

33:20.081 --> 33:23.148
We need hard proof that
that judge is dirty

33:23.150 --> 33:25.218
if Patel is ever gonna take us serious.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.072
Follow the paper, baby.

33:28.155 --> 33:29.822
Right.

33:29.824 --> 33:32.225
If he's taking kickbacks,

33:32.227 --> 33:35.094
the money is going into
an account somewhere.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.665
That's what I'm sayin'.

33:37.364 --> 33:40.299
Shit. My clients.

33:40.301 --> 33:45.471
Don't sleep on manicurists,
baby. We know every-damn-body.

33:49.043 --> 33:51.244
Linda Jones, Sunfirst Providian Bank.

33:51.246 --> 33:53.178
<i>What did you say
the judge's name was again?</i>

33:53.180 --> 33:54.580
<i>Richard Whitman?</i>

33:54.582 --> 33:55.981
<i>Sorry, he doesn't bank here.</i>

33:57.985 --> 33:59.985
<i>How can I help you?</i>

34:01.789 --> 34:04.857
You need tough shit, Desna.
I can get that for you.

34:09.996 --> 34:11.797
This have everything you need.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.532
Go get that bastard.

34:13.534 --> 34:15.134
I got your French tips for life.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.802
- Toes, too?
- Okay.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.603
Now, you doin' too much.

34:21.382 --> 34:23.581
Oh, shit.

34:23.811 --> 34:26.612
All right. Toes, too.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.621
Oh. Ooh!

34:35.623 --> 34:37.623
Pour moi?

34:53.308 --> 34:55.239
Don't be stingy, girl. What is it?

34:55.242 --> 34:57.110
Oh.

34:57.112 --> 34:59.645
It's just one of those, uh...

34:59.647 --> 35:02.047
portable garment steamers from Amazon.

35:02.049 --> 35:04.317
You know how I love my crispy slacks.

35:04.319 --> 35:05.785
Um, just a minute.

35:05.787 --> 35:08.253
I'm gonna go put this
in the office, okay?

35:32.813 --> 35:35.148
Hey. I-I've been trying to call you.

35:35.150 --> 35:38.684
- I swear I had no idea...
- Yeah, yeah, relax, relax, relax, okay?

35:38.686 --> 35:42.287
I'm sorry. It's my fault
I popped off like that.

35:42.289 --> 35:44.918
I just get so, you know...

35:45.560 --> 35:48.627
possessive over dick,
even if it's my own leftovers.

35:48.629 --> 35:51.964
Okay. But you know I would never
intentionally hurt you.

35:51.966 --> 35:53.426
You my girl.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.435
Come in here.

35:56.437 --> 35:58.171
I know.

35:58.173 --> 36:00.573
Listen, EJ and I, we've been
broken up for a minute,

36:00.575 --> 36:02.775
so I don't have any kind of claim to him.

36:02.777 --> 36:05.480
If you want him, he's yours, okay?

36:06.247 --> 36:08.181
- Girl, bye.
- I'm serious.

36:08.183 --> 36:10.716
You're a beautiful little... dust mop.

36:10.718 --> 36:12.517
I just want you to be happy.

36:12.519 --> 36:13.786
I mean, I want you to be with Dean,

36:13.788 --> 36:15.454
but if that's not the way
the wind's blowin'...

36:15.456 --> 36:17.723
I'm don't really know
what I want right now, so...

36:17.725 --> 36:19.592
I know.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.394
You do follow me on the 'Gram,
though, right?

36:21.396 --> 36:23.396
Yeah. Now I do.

36:24.040 --> 36:27.400
And you don't really
have herpes, though, right?

36:27.402 --> 36:30.669
Oh, no, I absolutely do.
Yeah, that's forever.

36:36.411 --> 36:39.579
I didn't even think
people took PCP anymore.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.549
You want me to take it?

36:44.485 --> 36:48.554
Literally he took a desk and
threw it across the squad room.

36:51.158 --> 36:54.159
Hello? Anyone listening?

36:54.863 --> 36:56.962
I'm sharing here.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.752
I'm pregnant.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.179
Are you kidding?

37:14.181 --> 37:16.982
No.

37:16.984 --> 37:19.919
This is that... that
one-night stand thing?

37:19.921 --> 37:21.520
Yeah.

37:21.522 --> 37:23.923
One-hit wonder.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.269
But, Arlene...

37:28.195 --> 37:30.263
I want this baby.

37:32.399 --> 37:34.781
I'll have it alone if I have to.

37:39.740 --> 37:41.533
I'm gonna need a minute.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.822
And that's why I'm urging Floridians

37:56.824 --> 37:59.358
to vote yes on Proposition 45.

38:01.762 --> 38:02.866
That's right.

38:02.868 --> 38:05.698
If we arm our teachers, we can make sure

38:05.700 --> 38:08.701
our kids live up to their potential

38:08.703 --> 38:10.703
by staying alive.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.305
Thank you for coming out today.

38:12.307 --> 38:14.239
- Whoo!
- Let's hear it!

38:14.241 --> 38:16.175
Patel! Patel!

38:16.177 --> 38:21.114
Patel! Patel! Patel! Patel! Patel!

38:21.116 --> 38:23.048
- Thank you.
- Hey, Governor.

38:23.050 --> 38:26.319
Oh, God, what a beautiful speech.
It was so forceful.

38:26.321 --> 38:27.848
Mightn't I get a pic? Let's get in here.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.121
Of course you can, sweetheart.

38:29.123 --> 38:31.991
Okay. Say "Des."

38:31.993 --> 38:33.926
Not you again.

38:33.928 --> 38:36.662
Yep, me again.

38:36.664 --> 38:39.598
This time I got proof.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.468
Every kickback from Whitman is in there.

38:42.470 --> 38:45.070
- I left you a cute little note, too.
- Shameful...

38:45.072 --> 38:47.806
paying that bastard to fill
a prison with innocent people.

38:47.808 --> 38:50.743
Prisons that you took bribes to build.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.278
I don't think y'all are gonna
be able to connect the dots.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.402
If you don't help us
take down Mac and Melba,

38:55.427 --> 38:57.350
we gonna blow all your shit up.

38:57.352 --> 38:59.517
- Oh, how?
- Uh, easy.

38:59.519 --> 39:01.687
By feeding every bit
of information to your opponent.

39:01.689 --> 39:02.949
Duh.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.891
I don't think y'all have the balls.

39:05.893 --> 39:08.627
You don't need balls to drop a dime.

39:08.629 --> 39:11.564
And, out of curiosity, how
the hell did you get into bed

39:11.566 --> 39:13.366
with Mac and Melba anyway?

39:13.368 --> 39:15.100
Oh, we're old friends.

39:15.102 --> 39:18.798
And I kept my mouth shut
about their casino scam.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.842
Bayside's not a real
Native American casino.

39:22.844 --> 39:24.377
It's not on native land.

39:24.379 --> 39:26.712
They just say it is to make a buck.

39:26.714 --> 39:29.048
So your ass is screwing everybody...

39:29.050 --> 39:30.850
black, brown, red.

39:30.852 --> 39:32.317
Money's green.

39:32.319 --> 39:34.520
That's the only color I care about.

39:34.522 --> 39:36.255
Well, we got that in common,

39:36.257 --> 39:38.457
which is why you gonna play with us.

39:38.459 --> 39:41.394
This is how it's gonna go, 'kay?

39:41.396 --> 39:43.796
First, you gonna kill the prison deal.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.731
You're gonna help us take down
Mac and Melba,

39:45.733 --> 39:47.466
and in return for that,

39:47.468 --> 39:49.802
I'm gonna clean your money
at a far better rate

39:49.804 --> 39:51.871
than you ever got from the two of them.

39:51.873 --> 39:55.941
I thought you was a Robin Hood
with press-on nails.

39:55.943 --> 39:59.212
Don't get it twisted. We full gangsta.

39:59.214 --> 40:01.314
With full sets.

40:19.500 --> 40:24.170
Look, I know the whole
baby thing is scary,

40:24.172 --> 40:26.505
but if you could just talk to me, then...

40:26.507 --> 40:28.707
Let's get married.

40:28.709 --> 40:30.442
What? What?

40:30.444 --> 40:32.444
Is that a yes?

40:32.446 --> 40:34.513
Yes! Yes!

40:38.719 --> 40:43.789
So, wait. So... So, you're okay
with having a baby?

40:43.791 --> 40:45.992
- Yeah, I'm more than okay.
- Yeah?

40:45.994 --> 40:49.061
I was just trying to save myself
from the heartache,

40:49.063 --> 40:51.063
like with that adoption stuff.

40:51.065 --> 40:52.767
This is different.

40:53.401 --> 40:55.401
We're pregnant!

40:55.645 --> 40:57.736
We're pregnant!

41:01.942 --> 41:03.342
I love you.

41:03.344 --> 41:06.212
You promise you're not punking me?

41:06.214 --> 41:08.341
When you said "naloxone"

41:08.366 --> 41:10.483
like a real doctor in a real emergency,

41:10.485 --> 41:13.886
I got so turned on, I had to
show you what I'm really into!

41:13.888 --> 41:15.888
Okay.

41:24.164 --> 41:25.297
Say it again.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.500
- Naloxone.
- Ahh!

41:28.502 --> 41:30.636
- What are you doing?
- Chase me, you idiot!

41:43.718 --> 41:45.261
You want to take me back to your burrow?

41:45.286 --> 41:46.519
I want to go deep in that burrow.

41:46.521 --> 41:48.739
Oh, you want to show
that ferret who's boss?

41:48.741 --> 41:51.390
Ferret? I thought we were skunks.

41:51.392 --> 41:53.726
Make some badger sounds, bitch!

41:59.600 --> 42:01.534
Hey-o! All right!

42:01.536 --> 42:04.070
Good job, y'all! We done for tonight.

42:04.072 --> 42:05.767
Keep comin' back. See ya next time.

42:05.769 --> 42:07.406
Hey, Leroy, I'm real proud of you.

42:07.408 --> 42:09.075
Gettin' clean ain't easy.

42:09.077 --> 42:10.609
It ain't. Here's to day two!

42:10.611 --> 42:12.811
We're rootin' for ya.
Day two... come on, now!

42:12.813 --> 42:14.747
Come on!

42:14.749 --> 42:16.298
Hey, Miss Brenda.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.284
What say you and I do some more dancin'?

42:18.286 --> 42:22.221
Clay, thanks for the offer.

42:22.223 --> 42:26.225
If I'm really honest, as much
as I love getting gussied up

42:26.227 --> 42:28.026
and goin' out,

42:28.028 --> 42:31.764
what really moves my heart
is just stayin' home

42:31.766 --> 42:35.902
and trimmin' my bonsai and
watchin' Home Shopping Network

42:35.904 --> 42:38.237
and doin' my latchkey rugs.

42:40.174 --> 42:42.708
I just got to find somebody
to do them with.

42:42.710 --> 42:45.296
Shut yo' mouth.

42:46.506 --> 42:48.915
You like bonsai, too?

42:48.917 --> 42:52.919
I had me one of them sagamikis,

42:52.921 --> 42:56.255
but it, uh...
never really thrived for me.

42:56.257 --> 42:58.991
Oh, you gotta give 'em the secret sauce.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.229
Oh, yeah? What's that? Fertilizer?

43:01.796 --> 43:03.529
Gin, honey.

43:30.158 --> 43:32.358
Pop goes the weasel.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.294
You're in a no-fly zone, Desna.

43:35.296 --> 43:37.630
Maybe we haven't been quite clear enough.

43:37.632 --> 43:39.766
The prison deal is dead.

43:39.768 --> 43:41.630
Hmm.

43:41.632 --> 43:43.916
Oh, you've been co-opted.

43:44.904 --> 43:46.705
If you know what's good for your ass,

43:46.707 --> 43:49.241
you and your snake oil would step.

43:49.243 --> 43:51.844
This isn't even Native American land.

43:51.846 --> 43:54.713
We give them what they want
so we get what we want.

43:54.715 --> 43:57.249
Do whatever you want.

43:57.251 --> 43:59.652
But we changing shit up.

43:59.654 --> 44:01.587
This casino is mine now...

44:01.589 --> 44:02.921
All of it.

44:02.923 --> 44:05.391
Well, that is a really
nifty little plan there,

44:05.393 --> 44:07.259
Double-F Cup, but it cannot happen.

44:07.261 --> 44:09.261
We listen to a higher power.

44:09.263 --> 44:11.597
Please. Y'all are godless.

44:11.599 --> 44:14.933
He is referring to the Macau Triads.

44:14.935 --> 44:17.603
Biggest money launderers in the world.

44:17.605 --> 44:19.605
Not to mention the deadliest.

44:19.607 --> 44:23.542
What's important is that
Macau cannot know about this.

44:23.544 --> 44:25.211
If you take over,
the cat is out of the bag,

44:25.213 --> 44:26.879
and we are all dead,

44:26.881 --> 44:30.416
including... our son.

44:30.418 --> 44:33.219
You don't have a son,
you dried up old bag.

44:33.221 --> 44:36.689
Sure we do. You want to come here, champ?

44:38.158 --> 44:42.228
Meet Dean Lovestone.

44:42.230 --> 44:44.927
We legally adopted him this morning.

44:44.929 --> 44:47.299
What the hell is going on, Dean?

44:47.301 --> 44:49.235
W-W-We're all family now. Yes.
